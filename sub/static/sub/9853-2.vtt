00:00.431 --> 00:02.833
♪♪

00:10.741 --> 00:12.383
Too big?

00:12.383 --> 00:14.445
Play it cool, Harley.

00:16.447 --> 00:18.089
Terrible!

00:18.089 --> 00:20.421
Come on, face,
stop letting me down.

00:20.421 --> 00:23.454
Today's my birthday.

00:23.454 --> 00:26.457
Mom always takes a picture
the minute you walk downstairs,

00:26.457 --> 00:29.300
then puts it on
our family birthday calendar.

00:29.300 --> 00:32.262
My past few years'
have been a freak show.

00:38.439 --> 00:40.811
I can work with that.
Show time.

00:42.513 --> 00:44.415
In case you haven't
 figured it out,

00:44.415 --> 00:46.717
birthdays are kind of
 a big deal in my family.

00:46.717 --> 00:49.080
Ooh.

00:49.080 --> 00:51.422
The pancake
 assembly line.

00:51.422 --> 00:52.923
Must be for my big day.

00:55.226 --> 00:58.729
The birthday kid always
 gets the biggest pancake.

00:58.729 --> 01:01.532
There it is.

01:01.532 --> 01:04.334
That one's mine.

01:06.997 --> 01:09.540
Last one down
gets the fiber cereal.

01:09.540 --> 01:12.203
Hope you don't have plans
for the next two hours.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.806
And here.
Spoons are dirty.

01:18.909 --> 01:21.352
What?!
I can't believe it.

01:21.352 --> 01:23.684
They forgot
my birthday.

01:23.684 --> 01:25.386
I mean, when you're
the middle kid,

01:25.386 --> 01:28.489
being overlooked
is part of the deal.

01:28.489 --> 01:31.792
But my birthday?
This is a new low.

01:33.894 --> 01:36.367
All right,
everybody shush.

01:36.367 --> 01:40.000
I have a special
announcement to make.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.334
Today's a very
important day.

01:43.334 --> 01:45.105
I'm dying my hair.

01:45.105 --> 01:48.279
That's your
special announcement?

01:48.279 --> 01:50.741
Special for me.
A grown woman should
not be coloring her grays

01:50.741 --> 01:52.313
with a magic marker.

01:54.315 --> 01:55.986
Not gonna lie.

01:55.986 --> 01:57.518
I feel bad.

01:57.518 --> 02:00.521
And so will Mom and Dad
when I tell them they forgot.

02:00.521 --> 02:03.224
They're gonna feel guilty.
Really guilty.

02:03.224 --> 02:05.596
( all chattering )

02:05.596 --> 02:07.258
HARLEY: Hang on.

02:07.258 --> 02:10.761
I could use that guilt
for something really good.

02:10.761 --> 02:13.264
For something
 money can't buy.

02:13.264 --> 02:14.635
But guilt can.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.267
Thirty-eight,
39, 40.

02:16.267 --> 02:19.640
Don't move.
He is about
to set a record.

02:19.640 --> 02:22.373
I could get the best seat
 in the car.

02:29.580 --> 02:31.582
The sweet seat.

02:31.582 --> 02:35.256
Thanks. I thought these jeans
were working for me, too.

02:38.859 --> 02:40.591
Enjoy it now, Rachel,

02:40.591 --> 02:42.933
'cause that seat's
 going to be mine.

If no one
remembers my birthday,

03:41.392 --> 03:44.295
I can basically ask for
anything I want.

03:44.295 --> 03:46.657
So why would I spend
all my guilt points

03:46.657 --> 03:48.529
for a better seat
in the car?

03:48.529 --> 03:52.032
Let me school you on
life in a big family.

03:52.032 --> 03:54.204
The best seat
 goes to the oldest kid,

03:54.204 --> 03:55.706
which means I'm
 three kids away

03:55.706 --> 03:57.268
from getting it.

03:57.268 --> 04:00.010
Instead of
 a thousand more years

04:00.010 --> 04:02.273
stuck in the combat seat,

04:02.273 --> 04:04.375
I could leap frog
 to the spot

04:04.375 --> 04:06.647
where you can feel
 the air vent,

04:06.647 --> 04:09.179
look out the window
 without a foot in your face.

04:09.179 --> 04:11.722
Don't ask why
 I'm wearing a tiara.

04:11.722 --> 04:14.455
I just am.

04:14.455 --> 04:16.587
I wanna sit like that.

04:16.587 --> 04:18.428
I wanna look like that.

04:18.428 --> 04:19.990
I need those guilt points,

04:19.990 --> 04:21.932
and the only way
to get them

04:21.932 --> 04:23.664
is if no one remembers
my birthday.

04:23.664 --> 04:26.567
One giant reminder
 I need to hide.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.469
The birthday box.

04:33.344 --> 04:34.775
Ah!

04:34.775 --> 04:37.107
I feel like
today is something.

04:37.107 --> 04:39.009
You ever have the feeling
like you've forgotten something,

04:39.009 --> 04:41.512
and it's right on
the tip of your brain?

04:41.512 --> 04:42.953
Whenever I get that feeling,

04:42.953 --> 04:44.885
I forget about it
and move on to something else.

04:44.885 --> 04:47.558
I just feel like
it's right under my nose.

04:47.558 --> 04:50.461
It's actually right
under her butt.

04:50.461 --> 04:52.192
All our family
birthday traditions.

04:52.192 --> 04:54.264
With seven kids
 in the family,

04:54.264 --> 04:56.597
the things in that box
 got a ton of play.

04:56.597 --> 04:59.299
Happy first
birthday, Rachel.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.702
We love you.

05:01.702 --> 05:05.506
Oh, you are
an angel from heaven.

05:05.506 --> 05:08.409
Happy birthday,
Georgie Porgie.

05:08.409 --> 05:10.541
Tom, bring
Rachel over.

05:10.541 --> 05:13.113
She's biting
my finger, she's
biting my finger!

05:13.113 --> 05:15.015
( kids crying )

05:15.015 --> 05:17.017
Do we have
a boy crown?

05:17.017 --> 05:19.750
SUZY: Just put it on him.
I'm changing two diapers here!

05:19.750 --> 05:22.423
Here you go, Ethan.

05:22.423 --> 05:24.995
HARLEY: Fast forward to
 my cake last year.

05:24.995 --> 05:27.958
Yuck. A janky crown,
 a lumpy candle,

05:27.958 --> 05:30.461
and a plate that sounds
 like a dolphin crying.

05:30.461 --> 05:32.162
It's not pretty,

05:32.162 --> 05:34.465
but that's my family's
 birthday tradition.

05:34.465 --> 05:38.669
And right now, it's standing
between me and the sweet seat.

05:38.669 --> 05:40.811
I thought it might be
Static Electricity Day,

05:40.811 --> 05:41.942
but it's not.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.644
I wish someone
told my hair.

05:43.644 --> 05:45.616
Maybe it's
Take A Hike Day.

05:45.616 --> 05:47.578
You should
get on that.

05:47.578 --> 05:49.079
I hope it's not
Thank The Mailman Day.

05:49.079 --> 05:51.852
I'd hate to not have bought
Ernie a gift.

05:51.852 --> 05:54.585
I'd mail him something,
but that seems rude.

06:00.891 --> 06:03.333
Hey, Harley.

06:03.333 --> 06:05.796
Hey, guys.
What's going on?

06:05.796 --> 06:07.337
We've got
an offer for you.

06:07.337 --> 06:09.099
I'll do the talking.

06:09.099 --> 06:11.872
You just stand there
and think about cotton candy.

06:11.872 --> 06:14.144
I wanna do the talking.

06:14.144 --> 06:16.407
All right.
Go ahead.

06:16.407 --> 06:17.948
Cotton candy.

06:19.179 --> 06:21.782
Oh, why'd you have
to say cotton candy?

06:21.782 --> 06:23.414
All right,
you talk.

06:23.414 --> 06:26.316
It's about
your latest invention.

06:26.316 --> 06:28.859
The skate kite.

06:30.320 --> 06:31.862
As you know,

06:31.862 --> 06:34.124
all vehicles must
be tested before
they hit the market.

06:34.124 --> 06:35.796
We'd like to
help with that.

06:35.796 --> 06:38.729
Think of us as
your personal
crash test dummies.

06:38.729 --> 06:41.231
I don't need
crash test dummies.

06:42.933 --> 06:44.635
Then think of us as
two kids

06:44.635 --> 06:46.707
who really wanna
ride your skate kite.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.509
Scram, monkeys!

06:54.014 --> 06:55.946
DAPHNE: Happy
birthday, Harley!

06:58.919 --> 07:01.752
How did you remember
my birthday?

07:01.752 --> 07:04.895
I didn't. I remember
when we're getting cake.

07:04.895 --> 07:07.898
Sh! I don't want anyone
to know it's my birthday.

07:07.898 --> 07:10.801
I see.

07:10.801 --> 07:13.363
Join me in
my bedroom.

07:17.007 --> 07:19.209
Since when is this
your bedroom?

07:19.209 --> 07:22.543
Since I told Mom I don't
do trundle beds.

07:22.543 --> 07:24.975
Look, I wanna keep
this birthday thing

07:24.975 --> 07:27.347
between you and me.

07:27.347 --> 07:29.980
No problem.
Hit me with a Jackson.

07:29.980 --> 07:31.682
- A what?
- 20 bucks.

07:31.682 --> 07:34.424
Abuela always sends us
a 20 on our birthday.

07:34.424 --> 07:35.856
Cough it up.

07:35.856 --> 07:38.629
Can you not shake me down
just this once?

07:38.629 --> 07:41.692
Keeping my secret
could be your birthday
gift to me.

07:43.734 --> 07:46.967
It's Harley's birthday!

07:46.967 --> 07:48.939
I never get you a gift.

07:48.939 --> 07:51.542
Today's your birthday?!

07:51.542 --> 07:53.904
I'm not paying.
You already blabbed.

07:53.904 --> 07:56.777
Georgie!

08:02.052 --> 08:03.884
Never mind.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.823
I can't believe
I forgot your birthday.

08:12.823 --> 08:14.965
Everyone did.
It's a good thing.

08:14.965 --> 08:16.827
It is?

08:16.827 --> 08:19.029
Then you're gonna love
the present I didn't get you.

08:19.029 --> 08:21.331
Here's the thing.

08:21.331 --> 08:24.474
I need to get through
the whole day without
Mom and Dad remembering.

08:24.474 --> 08:26.336
I don't blame you.

08:26.336 --> 08:28.879
I got lice from
that birthday crown last year.

08:28.879 --> 08:31.882
Not great having a birthday
right after Lewie and Beast.

08:31.882 --> 08:34.414
Look, if Mom
and Dad forget,

08:34.414 --> 08:36.446
they will feel so guilty,
I can ask for

08:36.446 --> 08:37.918
Rachel's seat in the car.

08:37.918 --> 08:39.950
The sweet seat.

08:39.950 --> 08:41.952
Genius use of
guilt points.

08:41.952 --> 08:44.925
So no one can find out
it's my birthday.

08:44.925 --> 08:46.827
Come on, Harls.

08:46.827 --> 08:49.029
As soon as people have
a second to stop and think,

08:49.029 --> 08:51.001
someone will remember.

08:51.001 --> 08:52.933
That's why I'm
going to make sure

08:52.933 --> 08:54.204
no one has a second
to stop and think.

08:54.204 --> 08:56.567
Now, Mom's
the big threat.

08:56.567 --> 09:00.010
But, happy birthday to me,
 she's dying her hair.

09:00.010 --> 09:02.012
We all know
 how this goes.

09:02.012 --> 09:04.314
First, she'll do it wrong.

09:04.314 --> 09:06.016
( crying )

09:06.016 --> 09:08.649
Then she'll cry
 for a while.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.951
Then she'll eat
 a bag of chips.

09:10.951 --> 09:13.624
Then she'll cry some more
because she ate a bag of chips.

09:15.656 --> 09:18.228
Then she'll go to the store
and get another box of dye.

09:18.228 --> 09:20.090
And chips.

09:20.090 --> 09:21.832
And then she'll
try it all again.

09:21.832 --> 09:23.133
We're talking
at least midnight

09:23.133 --> 09:25.095
until the shame
spiral ends.

09:25.095 --> 09:27.037
Shame spiral.

09:27.037 --> 09:29.039
Cool. Now I know
what to call it.

09:29.039 --> 09:32.102
Also, good name
for a band.

09:32.102 --> 09:34.975
Mom's covered,
Dad's at work.

09:34.975 --> 09:37.347
Now we just have to
 keep everyone else busy.

09:38.879 --> 09:41.111
Well, it wasn't
Thank The Mailman Day,

09:41.111 --> 09:43.684
but Ernie did appreciate
the English toffee.

09:43.684 --> 09:45.786
Also, it is not
English Toffee Day.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.487
Also, his name is Rick.

09:47.487 --> 09:49.720
You can stop
trying to figure it out,

09:49.720 --> 09:50.891
because I looked it up.

09:50.891 --> 09:52.592
It's National
High Five Day.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.695
That was last week.

09:54.695 --> 09:56.526
Right.

09:56.526 --> 09:58.729
Um, of course, um...

09:58.729 --> 10:01.031
I meant International
High Five Day.

10:01.031 --> 10:03.133
Opening ceremonies
were great.

10:03.133 --> 10:05.936
Everybody was like,
whoa, whoa.

10:05.936 --> 10:07.978
Really? Cool.

10:07.978 --> 10:11.281
Konichiwa.

10:11.281 --> 10:13.644
HARLEY: Georgie's busy.

10:13.644 --> 10:15.215
Now to distract the boys.

10:18.048 --> 10:20.320
Skate kite!

10:22.893 --> 10:25.425
I feel bad
I blew you off earlier.

10:25.425 --> 10:28.058
You're just the dummies
I need to test this.

10:28.058 --> 10:30.060
You won't be disappointed.

10:30.060 --> 10:31.331
Cotton candy.

10:32.703 --> 10:34.705
Dang. It's all
I can think about.

10:36.000 --> 10:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here

10:44.114 --> 10:45.846
( crashing sounds )

10:47.447 --> 10:49.449
My turn!

10:58.058 --> 11:01.091
I like that sweater,
Harley.

11:01.091 --> 11:03.263
You're not getting
my sweater.

11:03.263 --> 11:06.596
I already gave you money
to keep my birthday a secret.

11:06.596 --> 11:08.168
Aloha.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.170
You know what
today is?

11:10.170 --> 11:12.703
International
High Five Day.

11:14.845 --> 11:16.046
Is it?

11:25.385 --> 11:27.117
What are you doing today?

11:27.117 --> 11:30.620
Besides judging your T-shirt?
Going over to Cuff's.

11:30.620 --> 11:33.724
You should have
him come here.

11:33.724 --> 11:37.768
I'm not worried about
Rachel remembering my birthday.

11:37.768 --> 11:39.369
She's all about Rachel.

11:39.369 --> 11:41.131
She'll self-distract.

11:41.131 --> 11:43.503
But having Cuff here
will keep Dad nice and busy

11:43.503 --> 11:45.175
when he gets home from work.

11:45.175 --> 11:47.107
Cuff here?
Crazy bad call.

11:47.107 --> 11:49.379
You know
Dad can't stand him.

11:49.379 --> 11:52.242
Okay, but going over
to his place?

11:52.242 --> 11:54.684
Not exactly the power move.

11:54.684 --> 11:56.546
Don't you have something
lame to build?

11:56.546 --> 11:57.948
I'm just sayin'.

11:57.948 --> 12:00.851
Jay Z always went over
to Beyoncé's house.

12:00.851 --> 12:02.322
That's a well-known fact.

12:05.195 --> 12:07.157
Pretty sure
 I got in her head.

12:07.157 --> 12:10.901
The plan is
working perfectly.
Everyone's busy.

12:10.901 --> 12:14.034
Butt, get ready
for the sweet seat.

12:14.034 --> 12:16.867
You're good.
I'm in awe.

12:16.867 --> 12:18.969
And a little bit scared.

12:21.471 --> 12:24.074
- No!
- ( Suzy screams )

12:24.074 --> 12:26.416
Are you hiding again?

12:26.416 --> 12:28.018
Of course I am.

12:28.018 --> 12:29.579
When you've got seven kids,
if they see you,

12:29.579 --> 12:31.021
they're gonna ask you
for something.

12:31.021 --> 12:33.423
Like right there.
You just asked me a question.

12:33.423 --> 12:34.855
I thought you were
dying your hair.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.426
And another.

12:36.426 --> 12:38.558
Well, I can see this
isn't gonna happen.

12:38.558 --> 12:42.732
So I finished my hair,
and it went great.

12:42.732 --> 12:45.065
Turns out you shouldn't
just throw away the directions.

12:45.065 --> 12:46.997
If you were good at
reading directions,

12:46.997 --> 12:49.039
I wouldn't have broken
my tooth on your quiche.

12:49.039 --> 12:51.771
Anyway, I have some
unexpected down time,

12:51.771 --> 12:54.244
which is good because
I've had this feeling all day

12:54.244 --> 12:55.775
like I'm
forgetting something.

12:58.208 --> 13:01.711
Maybe it's
a cleaning thing.

13:01.711 --> 13:04.684
The upstairs bathroom should
definitely be on some list.

13:04.684 --> 13:06.186
No, I already bumped
that to next week.

13:06.186 --> 13:08.688
Didn't you bump that
last week?

13:08.688 --> 13:11.121
See, this is why
I was under the desk.

13:11.121 --> 13:13.023
Let me check
my day planner.

13:17.767 --> 13:19.129
Harley!

13:19.129 --> 13:22.132
That was an accident.

13:22.132 --> 13:23.673
I had a muscle spasm.

13:23.673 --> 13:25.535
Oh, there it goes again.

13:25.535 --> 13:28.979
You should probably take me
to see someone about that.

13:34.284 --> 13:36.917
I'm guessing
I'm punished.

13:36.917 --> 13:39.019
I set out to get
the sweet seat.

13:41.551 --> 13:43.753
This is not it.

13:58.238 --> 13:59.439
Mom's no dummy.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.511
She knew if she
pushed this off long enough,

14:01.511 --> 14:04.074
one of us would
get punished and
end up doing it.

14:04.074 --> 14:05.946
I'm down 20 bucks,
a sweater,

14:05.946 --> 14:07.777
and I had to do this.

14:07.777 --> 14:09.379
If I don't get
the sweet seat,

14:09.379 --> 14:11.551
this will be
the worst birthday ever.

14:15.425 --> 14:18.358
Now I need
a haz-mat suit.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.530
I'm going shopping
at the mall.

14:20.530 --> 14:22.792
You should, too.

14:22.792 --> 14:24.334
At least Daphne
has a cute sweater on.

14:24.334 --> 14:26.366
I thought Cuff
was coming here.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.568
Nah, he got a new ATV
he's riding around.

14:28.568 --> 14:30.540
Fun!

14:30.540 --> 14:33.173
He should totally come over
and give you a ride.

14:33.173 --> 14:36.907
Hello? Helmet hair.
No thanks.

14:36.907 --> 14:39.249
Okay, but everyone knows
the first girl

14:39.249 --> 14:41.211
to ride on the back
of a guy's bike

14:41.211 --> 14:42.983
becomes his lady.

14:42.983 --> 14:46.556
How do you think Beyoncé
got Jay Z to put a ring on it?

14:46.556 --> 14:48.618
Yeah. I'm not taking advice
from a person

14:48.618 --> 14:51.121
dressed like a trash can.

14:53.964 --> 14:55.325
This is bad.

14:55.325 --> 14:57.467
I need Cuff here
to keep Dad busy.

14:58.868 --> 15:00.300
I want ice cream
from a truck.

15:00.300 --> 15:03.003
Enough, thug life.
I'm your older sister--

15:03.003 --> 15:05.275
You got ten minutes
or I'll start talking.

15:06.476 --> 15:08.138
She's mellowing.

15:08.138 --> 15:10.910
I remember when she'd
only give you five minutes.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.612
( sighs )

15:12.612 --> 15:16.146
My plan to keep
everyone busy is unraveling.

15:16.146 --> 15:17.617
I can't take Daphne
for ice cream,

15:17.617 --> 15:20.850
and leave Mom home alone
with all that free time.

15:20.850 --> 15:23.223
There's a place
that has ice cream

15:23.223 --> 15:26.256
and keeps Mom busy
trying to wrangle her kids.

15:26.256 --> 15:27.827
The park.

15:29.259 --> 15:31.861
Of course. Why didn't
I think of that?

15:31.861 --> 15:34.864
Well, you're under
a lot of pressure
avoiding your special day.

15:40.240 --> 15:43.813
( kids screaming )

15:43.813 --> 15:46.816
Harley, why would you
buy them that?

15:46.816 --> 15:48.448
It makes them crazy.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.220
I said no more ice cream.

15:50.220 --> 15:53.223
Oh, I thought you said
more ice cream.

15:53.223 --> 15:55.125
Just trying to help...

15:55.125 --> 15:56.987
Get back here, kids.

15:56.987 --> 15:58.928
...myself.

15:58.928 --> 16:01.231
It's beautiful when
a plan comes together.

16:05.535 --> 16:07.937
I was video chatting
my friend in Germany,

16:07.937 --> 16:10.970
and she told me it is
not International High Five Day.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.203
I'm the laughingstock
of Dusseldorf.

16:13.203 --> 16:16.206
But I know today
is something special.

16:16.206 --> 16:17.807
( gasps )

16:17.807 --> 16:21.481
It's not my anniversary,
is it?

16:21.481 --> 16:25.085
It's, um...
National Sandwich Day.

16:25.085 --> 16:27.757
And all you can do
is bologna and cheese?

16:27.757 --> 16:30.220
This started out as
bologna and graham crackers,

16:30.220 --> 16:32.222
until I found the bread.

16:37.297 --> 16:39.829
That's what today is.
( gasps )

16:39.829 --> 16:41.901
- Hey!
- Should get
some milk with that.

16:43.973 --> 16:46.476
Harley doesn't want
anyone to know
it's her birthday.

16:46.476 --> 16:48.078
Okay. Wait, why?

16:48.078 --> 16:51.511
I'll explain it later.
We have to grab
that calendar

16:51.511 --> 16:53.683
before Dad sees it.
I'll distract him.

16:53.683 --> 16:56.286
Hey, Dad, I wanna
play you something.

16:56.286 --> 16:59.189
It's for my new band,
Shame Spiral.

17:20.240 --> 17:23.242
Um...
We are Shame Spiral.

17:23.242 --> 17:26.175
Wow, uh... at least
the band name's appropriate.

17:31.421 --> 17:34.654
Sh! I don't want
your sister to find out.

17:34.654 --> 17:36.856
So you know?

17:36.856 --> 17:38.458
Of course.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.530
Can't leave cake
around Daphne.

17:40.530 --> 17:42.192
Daphne?

17:42.192 --> 17:44.834
It was Tony's birthday
at work.

17:44.834 --> 17:46.836
I thought Daphne
would sniff this out,

17:46.836 --> 17:48.898
but I got smart.
I put coffee grounds around it,

17:48.898 --> 17:50.340
put her off the scent.

17:52.772 --> 17:55.004
Mm-mm.

17:55.004 --> 17:57.177
Okay, well, that bite
is mostly grounds.

17:59.109 --> 18:00.950
( kids screaming )

18:02.882 --> 18:05.515
I don't think
I've ever been so tired.

18:05.515 --> 18:07.957
You look tired.

18:07.957 --> 18:10.260
Well, in a few hours,
when we go home,

18:10.260 --> 18:12.522
you should probably
go right to bed.

Whoo hoo!
Faster, Cuff. Gun it!

18:30.540 --> 18:34.144
Rachel! Get off
that death machine!

18:34.144 --> 18:36.546
Rachel! Rachel!

18:36.546 --> 18:40.049
Mom and Dad are going
to be so mad at her for this,

18:40.049 --> 18:42.522
they'll probably forget
my next birthday.

18:42.522 --> 18:44.924
I know you see me!
I know you see me!

18:44.924 --> 18:46.426
Hello!

18:47.627 --> 18:49.799
You are so dead
if you get hurt.

18:49.799 --> 18:51.961
- Whoo hoo!
- Put your arms down.

18:55.605 --> 18:57.807
Thanks for helping Ethan
keep my secret.

18:57.807 --> 19:00.610
Sure. But I don't get why
you'd want everyone to forget

19:00.610 --> 19:02.372
your special day.

19:02.372 --> 19:04.744
That's because you haven't
had a six-hour car ride

19:04.744 --> 19:06.976
with Beast using your head
as bongo drums.

19:06.976 --> 19:09.319
No, I mean, you're going
to miss your birthday,

19:09.319 --> 19:10.780
and the box.

19:10.780 --> 19:13.152
That's our family
tradition.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.784
None of us have ever
missed out on it.

19:14.784 --> 19:16.926
But a birthday's
just a day.

19:16.926 --> 19:18.688
The sweet seat's
forever.

19:18.688 --> 19:22.592
But celebrating together
as a family won't be.

19:22.592 --> 19:24.494
Soon, Rachel will be
out of the house,

19:24.494 --> 19:26.135
me and Ethan right after.

19:26.135 --> 19:28.198
You just turned 13;
you're not that far behind.

19:28.198 --> 19:31.271
But I support
whatever you want.

19:31.271 --> 19:33.743
On behalf of
the whole family,

19:33.743 --> 19:35.545
happy birthday.

19:56.326 --> 19:58.298
Guilt.

19:58.298 --> 20:00.370
It could work for you,

20:00.370 --> 20:01.871
or it could work
 against you.

20:06.736 --> 20:08.908
Darn you, Georgie.

20:08.908 --> 20:12.282
I hate that I love
that birthday box.

20:12.282 --> 20:14.284
But I do.

20:14.284 --> 20:15.715
