Unh

01:32.509 --> 01:34.249
Yeah

01:34.428 --> 01:35.793
Life in the city

01:39.141 --> 01:41.883
Street life is a hustle

01:42.060 --> 01:43.470
Go on every day

01:43.645 --> 01:46.136
This life in the city,
three strikes in the city

01:46.315 --> 01:49.148
Childhood go hard,
street life ain't pretty

01:49.318 --> 01:51.730
Young soldier watching
the block's vultures

01:51.903 --> 01:54.440
Whips, women and paper
dominate the culture

01:54.615 --> 01:57.027
Rocks, pills, weed, flocking,
pimping and pandering

01:57.200 --> 01:59.657
Checks, credit, betting,
whatever hustle they handling

01:59.828 --> 02:02.490
Lost morals for mayors,
undercover patrol

02:02.664 --> 02:04.620
Scores of hos reside,
resident evil

02:04.791 --> 02:06.327
Everyday sequels

02:06.501 --> 02:08.866
Sony reds with bird's-eye views
or hood blues

02:09.045 --> 02:11.162
Get pinched
or shine through-- snitches

02:11.340 --> 02:14.173
Street life is a hustle

02:14.343 --> 02:15.753
Go on every day

02:15.927 --> 02:18.418
This life in the city,
three strikes in the city

02:18.597 --> 02:21.304
Childhood go hard,
street life ain't pretty...

02:23.060 --> 02:25.016
The Queensborough Court
is now in session.

02:25.187 --> 02:27.018
Jonas Maldonado,

02:27.189 --> 02:29.145
Lucas Ryan, A.D. Valburn,

02:29.316 --> 02:31.432
you're charged with criminal
possession of narcotics.

02:31.610 --> 02:33.271
How do you defendants plead?

02:33.445 --> 02:35.060
Due to mitigating circumstances,

02:35.238 --> 02:36.398
not guilty, Your Honor.

02:36.573 --> 02:39.030
The defendants have no priors.
We request bail.

02:39.201 --> 02:40.657
Bail denied.

02:43.455 --> 02:46.117
Street life is a hustle

02:46.291 --> 02:48.031
Go on every day

02:48.210 --> 02:50.542
This life in the city,
three strikes in the city

02:50.712 --> 02:53.454
Childhood go hard,
street life ain't pretty...

02:56.301 --> 02:59.338
In light of the new information
presented by ADA Vecchio,

02:59.513 --> 03:02.095
the three defendants are hereby
remanded to his custody.

03:02.265 --> 03:03.755
Bailiff.

03:04.976 --> 03:07.513
Street life is a hustle

03:07.688 --> 03:09.474
Go on every day

03:09.648 --> 03:12.139
This life in the city,
hood strife, it's a pity

03:12.317 --> 03:14.808
Childhood go hard,
street life ain't pretty.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.737
Come on, man. You see me trying
to give a speech here.

03:18.907 --> 03:21.364
Some of you have known
my best friends and l

03:21.535 --> 03:23.901
since we were delinquent
altar boys in grade school.

03:24.079 --> 03:26.741
Hey look, you can keep your
little giggles to yourself, all right?

03:26.915 --> 03:28.496
I know things about you too.

03:28.667 --> 03:30.453
You know,
it might've taken me a bit longer

03:30.627 --> 03:33.118
to decide to join,
but thanks to some help--

03:33.296 --> 03:37.164
you know, I just wanna say my pop--
if I could be

03:37.342 --> 03:39.298
- half the cop my pop was--
- Aww.

03:39.469 --> 03:42.586
Well, I hope I can be
half the cop my pop was.

03:42.764 --> 03:45.005
I just wanna thank everybody
for coming out

03:45.183 --> 03:46.673
and supporting me

03:46.852 --> 03:49.218
and my buddies who are
taking the plunge with me--

03:49.396 --> 03:51.637
and of course, other cadets.

03:51.815 --> 03:53.646
Yeah, other cadets.

03:53.817 --> 03:56.308
You know, um, let's party.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.226
- Let's have a good time.
- Yeah! Let's party!

04:05.579 --> 04:08.616
You're dangerous, boy,
you're dangerous...

04:08.790 --> 04:11.281
- Hey you.
- Hey. What's up?

04:14.421 --> 04:16.286
Congratulations, Jonas.

04:16.464 --> 04:18.547
I'm very proud of you.

04:20.343 --> 04:22.550
But it's been years.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.133
Why did you invite me?

04:26.850 --> 04:29.057
You still crushing on me, Jonas?

04:29.227 --> 04:30.888
I'm still trying to piss
your brother off.

04:31.062 --> 04:32.643
I'm just kidding.

04:32.814 --> 04:34.645
I'm still crushing on you a little bit.

04:34.816 --> 04:36.226
- Okay.
- Is that okay?

04:36.401 --> 04:38.938
Well, I was kinda
hoping we could settle

04:39.112 --> 04:41.103
some unfinished business tonight.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.897
Coincidence.
I was thinking the same thing.

04:46.995 --> 04:49.156
All right, here we go--
four shots of tequila.

04:49.331 --> 04:50.696
- Uh-oh.
- Ow.

04:50.874 --> 04:52.956
- Remember what happened last time.
- Right.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.663
- Uh-huh.
- Let me know if you need anything else.

04:55.837 --> 04:57.828
- All right.
- All right, so may we be

04:58.006 --> 05:00.543
each other's eyes, ears and fists.

05:00.717 --> 05:03.459
- To my boys.
- Hey, may we continue

05:03.637 --> 05:05.298
to stay on the right side of the law...

05:05.472 --> 05:08.680
- for once.
- To the ultimate hustle.

05:08.850 --> 05:11.182
- Hey.
- Cheers.

05:14.397 --> 05:15.386
Whoo!

05:17.192 --> 05:18.432
- Ooh.
- Hit me up.

05:19.611 --> 05:21.943
Hey, who invited Lydia?

05:23.865 --> 05:25.605
- Who's the cougar?
- The cougar's how we got

05:25.784 --> 05:28.526
in the academy.
I mean she helped us.

05:28.703 --> 05:30.284
Your dad being a cop wasn't enough?

05:30.455 --> 05:32.867
Remember when we were wild little kids?

05:34.042 --> 05:35.828
I remember my brother
not being too happy

05:36.002 --> 05:38.084
about some thug trying
to be my boyfriend at 1 6.

05:38.255 --> 05:40.246
I remember slinging rock
for your brother.

05:40.423 --> 05:43.586
- I remember your brother whipping--
- Mrs. Vecchio's husband

05:43.760 --> 05:45.091
is the assistant DA.

05:45.262 --> 05:46.877
We went to school with their son Kenny.

05:47.055 --> 05:49.421
Anyway, after your brother
beat Malo down,

05:49.599 --> 05:51.385
he snitched us out to the pigs.

05:51.560 --> 05:54.222
That feels weird wearing
this uniform right now.

05:54.396 --> 05:56.512
Will you tell this fool
we're cops now?

05:56.690 --> 05:58.555
- Law enforcement officers.
- What?

05:59.734 --> 06:02.726
Yeah. Angie-- he--

06:02.904 --> 06:04.735
he set us up with the police,

06:04.906 --> 06:06.862
you know, while we was
carrying his product.

06:07.033 --> 06:09.740
Mrs. V had her husband
pull some strings

06:09.911 --> 06:11.867
to get us out of jail
and into the academy.

06:12.038 --> 06:15.246
- Why would she do that for you guys?
- Dick for dollars.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.284
- What's dick for dollars?
- Shh. Nigga, you crazy.

06:19.462 --> 06:21.327
- Just-- shh shh.
- Yo, she was a freak.

06:21.506 --> 06:23.622
She used to pay these two
to smash her once a week.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.086
Now I never got to tap
the ADA's wife,

06:26.261 --> 06:29.344
so I invited her.
I figure I'm due, right?

06:29.514 --> 06:31.846
- You are an idiot. You know this.
- Maybe.

06:32.017 --> 06:34.929
- Yeah, there's something wrong.
- Congratulations to all of you.

06:35.103 --> 06:39.563
Oh God, you've still got
a fine ass, Mrs. V.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.270
- Thanks for coming, Mrs. V.
- You didn't invite me.

06:42.444 --> 06:45.481
- Can I please have a word with you?
- I got a word for you.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.234
I got you here.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.778
The least you could do is
sit down and talk with me.

06:54.956 --> 06:56.366
I could speak to you.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.498
I know some things
that you need to know.

06:59.669 --> 07:02.285
We know it wouldn't be possible
to be here without you.

07:02.464 --> 07:04.876
We know what you
and your husband did for us.

07:05.050 --> 07:06.665
- How is he?
- Dead.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.881
I'm sorry to hear that.

07:11.056 --> 07:13.889
Now that I have your attention--

07:14.059 --> 07:15.344
Why don't you just pull up a seat?

07:15.518 --> 07:17.133
Just come grieve
over here for a second,

07:17.312 --> 07:18.552
Iike right in this area.

07:21.483 --> 07:22.723
Call me.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.563
Would you still bend that over?

07:29.741 --> 07:30.981
No. You?

07:32.452 --> 07:34.659
Liar. Me too.

07:34.829 --> 07:37.992
- In a heartbeat.
- He fucking tells everything, man.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.578
Compliments
from the gentleman in the back.

07:44.923 --> 07:47.960
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

07:48.134 --> 07:49.499
I'ma go check it out.

07:56.434 --> 07:57.674
Sit down.

07:59.688 --> 08:02.054
- Ah.
- Congratulations, Jonas.

08:02.232 --> 08:05.099
- Thank you.
- No, you don't know me.

08:05.276 --> 08:08.860
- But you know me.
- My name is Captain Joe Sarcone.

08:09.030 --> 08:11.191
I head the Street Vice
Crimes Task Force.

08:11.366 --> 08:12.776
Your dad and me were partners.

08:16.913 --> 08:19.120
Now when you're done here,

08:19.290 --> 08:21.372
I want you to be at this place--
just you.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.455
God, you look just like him.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.245
Sharkey's?

08:27.424 --> 08:29.460
I'll leave a light on for you.

08:59.789 --> 09:01.620
You like what you see?

09:01.791 --> 09:04.123
Uh-huh.

09:04.294 --> 09:07.582
For seven years, me and your old man
were as thick as thieves.

09:08.673 --> 09:09.833
I promise this isn't

09:10.008 --> 09:11.748
some polished-up hustle to entrap you.

09:11.926 --> 09:14.633
It's all part of your birthright.
Welcome home.

09:14.804 --> 09:17.762
By the end of the night
they're gonna know our names

09:17.932 --> 09:21.891
But we never pay
'cause we'll all go up in flames

09:22.062 --> 09:24.724
Put it on my tab

09:24.898 --> 09:27.264
All the women and wine

09:28.777 --> 09:31.735
Put it on my tab...

09:31.905 --> 09:33.611
Let me know if I can
get you anything else.

09:33.782 --> 09:35.067
Thank you.

09:39.037 --> 09:40.277
Oh!

09:46.127 --> 09:48.618
You know, I'm not the type of man
to ask a big question

09:48.797 --> 09:51.664
without knowing the answer already.
Remember that.

09:51.841 --> 09:54.298
Besides honoring
the memory of your father,

09:54.469 --> 09:56.460
- why did you become a cop?
- I don't know.

09:56.638 --> 09:58.503
Get a little respect
in the neighborhood,

09:58.681 --> 10:00.296
maybe a little payback.

10:00.475 --> 10:02.136
Eh, one look at you,
I already know

10:02.310 --> 10:04.141
you got respect on the street.

10:04.312 --> 10:06.473
- Right?
- Yeah, a little bit.

10:06.648 --> 10:09.185
I'll ask you something else--
what's your life worth?

10:10.944 --> 10:13.526
If you had to put a price tag on it,
what would you say your life's worth?

10:15.532 --> 10:16.817
I don't know.
I never thought about that.

10:16.991 --> 10:20.028
- Would you say 46 grand?
- I don't know.

10:20.203 --> 10:22.740
Well, that's what the city of New York
seems to think it's worth--

10:22.914 --> 10:25.155
since you gotta go out there
and risk it every day.

10:26.584 --> 10:29.121
Personally, I feel my life's
worth more than that.

10:29.295 --> 10:31.786
A pat on the back
and an extra 1 0-grand-a-year raise

10:31.965 --> 10:34.627
for a job well done isn't worth my life
or any of the lives of my men.

10:34.801 --> 10:38.214
Either way, we gotta
get the job done, you know?

10:38.388 --> 10:40.379
What we do here...

10:42.267 --> 10:45.179
Iet's just call it the bonus system.

10:45.353 --> 10:48.345
Corruption in this city,
let alone in this country,

10:48.523 --> 10:50.935
is far beyond what
any of us can imagine.

10:52.193 --> 10:53.854
You confiscate a large sum of money--

10:54.028 --> 10:56.861
trust me, everybody takes their piece
as the money moves up the ranks.

10:57.031 --> 10:59.613
All we do here is we take our cut--
a finder's fee, that's all.

10:59.784 --> 11:02.867
I spread it amongst my men,
everybody's happy.

11:05.123 --> 11:06.363
Look, you wanna be on your own,

11:06.541 --> 11:08.907
nickel and diming on the street,
that's your business.

11:09.085 --> 11:11.918
But know this-- we are deep

11:12.088 --> 11:13.328
and we are invisible,

11:13.506 --> 11:15.622
all the way up
to the mayor's office.

11:17.302 --> 11:18.542
There's the Maldonado seed.

11:20.263 --> 11:22.720
- You hungry?
- I can always eat.

11:22.891 --> 11:26.133
Kitchen never closes
and everybody eats at my table.

11:26.311 --> 11:27.972
Hey, guys, what's it gonna be?

11:28.146 --> 11:29.556
You really trust everybody in here?

11:29.731 --> 11:31.722
That door you just walked through...

11:33.026 --> 11:34.937
only works one way-- in.

11:35.111 --> 11:37.147
Once you're in, the only way out

11:37.322 --> 11:39.938
is to the sounds
of gunshots and bagpipes.

11:40.116 --> 11:41.902
Don't ever force my hand.

11:46.748 --> 11:49.239
That's your FTO,
Lieutenant Dennis Lureu.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.829
Don't ever question Lureu.
Be like him.

11:52.003 --> 11:54.494
He's been my right hand
since your father left us.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.540
I'll get your boys assigned
to the same precinct.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.585
As for you--
no uniform, no beat.

12:03.348 --> 12:05.805
You work for me starting now--
if you accept.

12:07.602 --> 12:10.059
Your father always said
"Everybody's gotta stash

12:10.230 --> 12:12.141
a bit of sock money for a rainy day."

12:19.322 --> 12:20.687
To your father.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.281
Tonight we celebrate.

12:24.452 --> 12:26.488
Pick a girl. Have some fun.

12:28.248 --> 12:31.035
- Thank you, sweetie.
- Yup.

12:31.209 --> 12:33.291
What can I getcha?

12:33.461 --> 12:35.247
How you doing?
I'm the new guy.

12:37.966 --> 12:39.797
Hi, new guy.
I'm sure you're really nice,

12:39.968 --> 12:41.674
- but I don't fuck cops.
- I just got here.

12:41.844 --> 12:43.380
You're starting rumors
about me already?

12:43.554 --> 12:45.510
- What, you're not a cop?
- No, I'm not a nice guy.

12:45.682 --> 12:47.798
- Ah.
- Jonas Maldonado.

12:47.976 --> 12:50.308
Everybody calls me Malo.

12:50.478 --> 12:51.558
"Malo"-- that's cute.

12:51.729 --> 12:53.594
You're like a Puerto Rican bad guy.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.434
Well, my mom's black.
My father's Puerto Rican.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.223
- I don't do Puerto Ricans either.
- Damn.

12:57.402 --> 13:00.360
- Mmm.
- Where you from? What's your name?

13:00.530 --> 13:02.316
Don't you have some nice girl
waiting for you somewhere?

13:02.490 --> 13:03.980
- Come on.
- I don't want a nice girl.

13:04.158 --> 13:05.989
- I want you.
- You're a charmer.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.651
- Puerto Rico.
- You like peanut butter?

13:09.831 --> 13:11.321
- Yeah, I like peanut butter.
- Me too.

13:11.499 --> 13:13.114
See, we got all this in common.
Wanna fuck?

13:15.169 --> 13:17.706
- Unbelievable.
- I know a place.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.086
Yeah, where?
For peanut butter or for fucking?

13:19.257 --> 13:21.669
- Both.
- Yeah, I bet you do.

13:21.843 --> 13:23.959
I don't know why
you're playing hard to get.

13:33.771 --> 13:35.602
Oh!

13:35.773 --> 13:37.559
Yeah, you motherfuckers
play too much.

13:37.734 --> 13:40.350
- Arrest me, officer.
- Come back and get in your pocket.

13:45.700 --> 13:49.739
Good morning.
Coffee? It's hot.

13:53.750 --> 13:54.910
Man, you look soft.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.033
What?

13:59.464 --> 14:01.125
Badge ain't what protects us out here.

14:01.299 --> 14:02.880
It's having the balls to use it.

14:03.051 --> 14:05.042
You look like you're missing one.

14:07.722 --> 14:09.053
Let's get on outta here,

14:09.223 --> 14:10.929
see if we can find
that missing ball, all right?

14:19.692 --> 14:21.228
Hey.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.103
What? What's going on?

14:27.325 --> 14:28.656
Let me ask you something.

14:28.826 --> 14:31.112
You think any of these
young brothers out here

14:31.287 --> 14:34.324
got the same good sense you got
to try to better themselves?

14:34.499 --> 14:36.660
I mean, most of them look like
they juvenile delinquents.

14:36.834 --> 14:38.870
What you think? Right?

14:39.045 --> 14:40.410
Hmm?

14:41.798 --> 14:43.754
I mean-- l-- I don't know, sir.

14:43.925 --> 14:45.290
You know? Well, maybe.

14:45.468 --> 14:47.800
I mean, l-- I don't know.
Yes, no. You know?

14:47.970 --> 14:50.928
No no no no no no no.
No no no no.

14:51.099 --> 14:53.055
Don't do that.
Don't do that.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.217
- Do what?
- Choke up.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.260
"l don't know. I don't know."

14:57.438 --> 15:00.726
No. You know, you breathe
the same air as me, right?

15:00.900 --> 15:03.107
- Yeah. That's right.
- You a black man just like me, right?

15:03.277 --> 15:05.768
- Yes, sir.
- Learn to speak your mind, young blood.

15:05.947 --> 15:07.938
Don't be no stumblebum.

15:09.826 --> 15:11.532
Now only thing I ask is that you keep

15:11.702 --> 15:14.364
your eyes and your ears open, all right?

15:14.539 --> 15:16.996
Maybe be careful.
You might learn something.

15:17.166 --> 15:20.408
But you learn to speak your mind.

15:28.219 --> 15:30.175
Come on, babe. Let it go.

15:30.346 --> 15:32.507
Oh, damn.
You see the ass on that?

15:33.599 --> 15:35.180
Who wouldn't hit that? Who?

15:35.351 --> 15:36.887
Yo, I feel you on that.

15:38.312 --> 15:40.348
Just gotta double bag
in respect for the wife, am I right?

15:40.523 --> 15:42.559
No disrespect,
but you would nut in your pants,

15:42.733 --> 15:44.849
- she let you get a whiff of the tasty.
- What?

15:45.027 --> 15:47.234
- Look, English in the cruiser, please.
- Not like you'd do anything

15:47.405 --> 15:48.861
with her man handcuffing
her right now.

15:51.784 --> 15:54.070
- This motherfucker--
- What, you mean the gorilla?

15:54.245 --> 15:55.860
Watch this.

15:56.038 --> 15:58.495
What's up?

15:58.666 --> 16:01.032
- You got a problem?
- Come on, baby.

16:01.210 --> 16:02.996
That's right, keep walking.

16:03.171 --> 16:04.377
It's not worth it.

16:04.547 --> 16:05.662
Enjoy your day.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.501
That's some bullshit.

16:17.351 --> 16:20.093
And that's how
you keep control of a filthy nigger.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.312
Oh, it's like that?

16:24.358 --> 16:25.518
Yeah, it's like that.

16:25.693 --> 16:27.229
You got a problem with that, rookie?

16:47.048 --> 16:49.915
- You want a bump?
- No, I don't want none.

16:53.262 --> 16:56.129
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.837
Buy, break it, bag it, sell it

17:38.015 --> 17:40.097
Buy, break it,
bag it, sell it...

17:40.268 --> 17:43.055
- This is--
- Look at that.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.719
Ain't got no home training.

17:44.897 --> 17:47.104
Come on, sir.
Kids are gonna do what they want.

17:47.275 --> 17:49.482
When I was a youngster,

17:49.652 --> 17:53.190
doing what you want was
a privilege reserved for grown folk.

17:54.824 --> 17:56.735
You gotta remember
that our strength,

17:56.909 --> 18:00.117
our downfall,
lies with these youth.

18:01.497 --> 18:03.863
Who they mimic is who they become,

18:04.041 --> 18:06.453
and you know what they show.

18:07.837 --> 18:09.543
So we gotta be aware
of what we show,

18:09.714 --> 18:13.457
stop giving them grays
a reason to hate our ass.

18:15.303 --> 18:17.134
Hey, y'all, move. Let's go.

18:17.305 --> 18:18.761
- What?
- No, I said move.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.011
Oh my--

18:24.020 --> 18:25.635
Excuse me, sir-- the grays?

18:25.813 --> 18:28.304
Yeah, the grays.

18:28.482 --> 18:31.815
As in the gray-skinned,
gray-haired Caucasian crackers

18:31.986 --> 18:35.194
that you see smiling they smiles
on the TV talk show,

18:35.364 --> 18:37.355
talking the nonsensical bullshit about

18:37.533 --> 18:39.364
why the Negros call
each other the "N" word.

18:39.535 --> 18:42.026
Huh? You heard that?

18:42.204 --> 18:45.788
How they say it's because
we basically don't like ourselves

18:45.958 --> 18:48.074
or each other.
But that's all right

18:48.252 --> 18:50.493
that we don't take responsibility
for our actions

18:50.671 --> 18:52.707
because, you know,
we don't know no better.

18:52.882 --> 18:55.498
- Yeah, grays.
- Personally,

18:55.676 --> 18:58.042
I've never had a problem
with the word "nigga," sir.

18:58.220 --> 19:01.007
- You know, where I'm from, we--
- Oh!

19:01.182 --> 19:04.174
Oh, you-- so you must be one.

19:04.352 --> 19:06.092
I-- l--

19:06.270 --> 19:08.226
I knew I smelled something.

19:08.397 --> 19:10.513
Oh, man, come on.

19:10.691 --> 19:14.058
I'm riding in the car
with a full-blown nigga in a uniform.

19:14.236 --> 19:15.897
- Nigga in the uniform.
- Hey.

19:16.072 --> 19:17.482
You play ball, Mr. Nigga?

19:17.657 --> 19:19.363
Yeah, I play a little hoop.

19:19.533 --> 19:21.114
You know, but football was my thing.

19:21.285 --> 19:23.947
- I was a wide receiver in high school.
- Yeah? Good.

19:24.121 --> 19:26.157
I want you to come down
to a playground

19:26.332 --> 19:29.165
where I coach some kids
in the PAL team.

19:29.335 --> 19:31.246
- They would love it, you know?
- Uh-huh.

19:31.420 --> 19:34.787
You'd get a chance to meet
some proud young black men,

19:34.965 --> 19:37.297
not like the ones you know.

19:44.517 --> 19:47.884
What's up, Lureu?
Got some new shit.

19:48.062 --> 19:49.893
Always need a backup.

19:51.065 --> 19:52.555
Sometimes you need

19:52.733 --> 19:54.519
a backup for your backup.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.732
Go ahead, get something
for yourself, a'ight?

20:06.956 --> 20:09.163
Hey, you can't use the N-word.

20:09.333 --> 20:10.914
Why the hell not?

20:11.085 --> 20:12.416
'Cause you ain't got a pass.

20:12.586 --> 20:13.917
What, you do?

20:14.088 --> 20:16.625
Hell yes, I got a pass.

20:16.799 --> 20:19.791
Let me guess-- you got
some African-American buddies?

20:19.969 --> 20:21.834
Some brothers?

20:22.012 --> 20:25.425
Look, I was assigned
as your training officer to train you

20:25.599 --> 20:27.510
so you don't have
to learn the hard way.

20:27.685 --> 20:30.677
I got 1 5 years in the cruiser.
You got five hours.

20:30.855 --> 20:33.847
I'm trying to give you
the benefit of my experience.

20:34.984 --> 20:37.020
Buddy, you can throw
yourself under a bus

20:37.194 --> 20:39.355
to save one of these
fine African-Americans,

20:39.530 --> 20:42.363
Puerto Ricans, lndians,
Asians, Muslims-- whatever.

20:42.533 --> 20:44.615
Me, I'm gonna stay in the car
and I'm gonna live,

20:44.785 --> 20:47.276
have dinner with my wife and kid,
bang my girlfriend

20:47.455 --> 20:48.615
and collect my pension.

20:48.789 --> 20:51.405
I could care less
about these monkeys.

20:52.460 --> 20:54.792
- Fuck.
- And understand--

20:54.962 --> 20:57.749
these animals will eat you alive
if you give 'em a chance.

21:00.509 --> 21:02.591
Are we gonna have problems, rookie?

21:02.762 --> 21:04.627
Hey.

21:04.805 --> 21:06.466
When we're in this cruiser,

21:06.640 --> 21:08.801
you better have my back

21:08.976 --> 21:13.094
and you better do exactly
what I tell you. You got me?

21:13.272 --> 21:16.264
Shit can get real crazy
out here really quick.

21:17.568 --> 21:19.058
So when the time comes,

21:19.236 --> 21:21.602
you better get down like I tell you.

21:29.914 --> 21:32.872
All I got is this game

21:33.042 --> 21:35.658
And all I got
is my soul

21:35.836 --> 21:38.543
I'll give you all I got
until it's gone...

21:38.714 --> 21:41.296
Wait in the car, all right?

21:42.551 --> 21:45.167
'Cause all I know
is just pain

21:45.346 --> 21:48.338
Done lost it all
but remain

21:48.516 --> 21:51.929
'Cause truth be told,
a nigga know at the end of the day

21:52.102 --> 21:54.593
You gotta lose
before you could gain

21:54.772 --> 21:56.353
That's how you grow

21:56.524 --> 21:59.106
Gotta move, gotta get it,
gotta hustle, man

21:59.276 --> 22:02.313
And be an overachiever
when they don't understand

22:02.488 --> 22:04.820
'Cause we got the upper hand
whenever they shuffle

22:04.990 --> 22:06.355
I bet I'll royal flush you...

22:06.534 --> 22:08.991
What the fuck you think you doing,
selling drugs to kids?

22:09.161 --> 22:10.617
- Come on, man!
- Fucking punk!

22:10.788 --> 22:12.904
Forgot the rules of the block, huh?

22:13.082 --> 22:14.822
Say it.
Say the rule.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.615
- No candy for the kids.
- Mm-hmm.

22:16.794 --> 22:19.035
- I should book your little ass.
- Hey! Yo, hey!

22:19.213 --> 22:21.374
What are you doing?
Come on!

22:35.062 --> 22:36.393
Hey!

22:38.315 --> 22:40.101
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

22:40.276 --> 22:42.267
- He was selling drugs to kids.
- I don't give a shit

22:42.444 --> 22:43.729
if he was selling crack
to your grandmother!

22:43.904 --> 22:45.735
If I tell you to wait in the car,
then you--

22:45.906 --> 22:48.238
you wait in the car. A'ight?

23:04.758 --> 23:05.964
A'ight.

23:06.135 --> 23:08.342
You're on the street now, Malo.

23:08.512 --> 23:10.503
I never left the streets.

23:10.681 --> 23:13.218
It's a pretty easy first day.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.553
Don't get used to it.

23:18.105 --> 23:19.561
Man.

23:32.494 --> 23:35.452
Jonas, you know that I love you, right?

23:37.583 --> 23:39.323
Yeah, Pop.
I love you too.

23:39.501 --> 23:41.833
You're a good kid.

23:43.339 --> 23:45.079
I like driving around with you, Pop.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.337
Oh, I bet you do.

23:48.719 --> 23:50.175
Jonas.

23:52.222 --> 23:54.383
Yeah, I figured you'd be here today.

24:01.148 --> 24:03.389
- So you remembered.
- How could I forget?

24:05.653 --> 24:07.234
You haven't called.

24:09.990 --> 24:11.651
Can we talk?

24:13.369 --> 24:16.156
- About what?
- You don't think about me?

24:16.330 --> 24:19.163
I do. All the time.
You know that.

24:19.333 --> 24:21.369
I'm not gonna wait on you forever.

24:24.088 --> 24:25.828
Still working at your father's diner?

24:26.006 --> 24:27.291
Yes.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.422
If you'd come around
more often, you'd know that.

24:29.593 --> 24:32.050
He needs me there.
He doesn't trust anyone else.

24:32.221 --> 24:35.429
- What about your brother?
- Angie-- the wannabe gangsta?

24:35.599 --> 24:37.760
Please, don't even
get me started on that one.

24:37.935 --> 24:39.596
Still trying to be a tough guy?

24:43.857 --> 24:45.768
I just wanna be happy, Jonas.

24:46.819 --> 24:48.104
I want you to be happy.

24:48.278 --> 24:51.441
Why did you invite me
to your celebration at the bar?

24:53.409 --> 24:54.740
It's complicated. I--

24:54.910 --> 24:57.993
I can't even explain it.

24:58.163 --> 25:00.449
Look, I gotta go to work, Cyn.

25:00.624 --> 25:01.955
Jonas.

25:09.299 --> 25:11.381
Do what you feel you gotta do, Cyn.

25:21.770 --> 25:25.012
Officer requesting backup,
Parsons Boulevard.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.772
- That's right around the corner.
- Yeah, I know where it is.

25:33.365 --> 25:35.947
Put the pin.
Pull it, nigga, pull the pin.

25:37.244 --> 25:38.859
- Shut up, both of you!
- Come on, nigga!

25:39.038 --> 25:40.949
Hey, shut up, both of you!
Shut the hell up!

25:41.123 --> 25:43.284
Hey, put the gun on the ground
and step away from it!

25:43.459 --> 25:46.166
- Do it now!
- Fuck you, nigga! I'm ready to die.

25:46.336 --> 25:47.701
- I know that guy.
- It's Felix.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.745
- No no, Ricky.
- Shut the hell up!

25:49.923 --> 25:51.254
- I'll shoot you and your fucking dog.
- What?

25:51.425 --> 25:53.086
- Fuck you.
- Control that dog before I shoot it.

25:53.260 --> 25:54.921
Three witnesses over here, son.

25:55.095 --> 25:57.381
I run the block!
You feel me?

25:57.556 --> 25:59.888
And I don't need no pussy-ass cops
for this Puerto Rican bitch.

26:00.059 --> 26:04.098
Hey, put the gun on the ground
and step away from it! Do it now! Now!

26:04.271 --> 26:07.559
I'm Detective Lureu.
What is this?

26:07.733 --> 26:09.815
- Trying to figure it out, Officer.
- I'm Morrison.

26:09.985 --> 26:12.192
So we come around the corner,
these two come spilling out

26:12.362 --> 26:13.477
of the bodega, arguing.

26:13.655 --> 26:15.191
Out of nowhere, the big--
the black guy

26:15.365 --> 26:17.321
takes a swing at the little guy
with a knife in his hand.

26:17.493 --> 26:19.950
Little guy pulls a piece,
we draw weapons, you guys show up.

26:20.120 --> 26:22.111
I didn't even see where the gun
came from, it happened so fast.

26:22.289 --> 26:25.497
A'ight. I'm gonna take it
from here, uni.

26:27.669 --> 26:30.411
Put the gun down.
Put it down.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.545
It ain't going bad today, not today.

26:32.716 --> 26:34.957
Put the gun down, buddy.
Come on, put it on the ground.

26:35.135 --> 26:36.796
Right there.

26:36.970 --> 26:39.302
Right there on the ground.
Put the gun down.

26:39.473 --> 26:41.088
All right, it's your turn.

26:41.266 --> 26:43.552
Hey hey! You next, let's go.
Tie the dog up,

26:43.727 --> 26:45.263
- lay on the street. Let's go.
- Fuck you!

26:45.437 --> 26:47.473
If it's all the same to you, Officer,
I'll take it from here.

26:47.648 --> 26:49.388
No, it's my collar, my cuffs. No.

26:49.566 --> 26:51.773
Officer Burke's got rank here,
he decides.

26:51.944 --> 26:53.900
He's looking at me
like he wants to eat me.

26:54.071 --> 26:56.312
I want this monkey in my car,
my cuffs on him.

26:56.490 --> 26:58.355
I'm not asking you.
I'm telling you.

27:00.911 --> 27:04.074
Partner, draw your weapon
on Officer Redneck over here.

27:04.248 --> 27:07.081
Right now, do it.

27:07.251 --> 27:10.493
You out of your fucking mind?
The fuck you doing?

27:11.547 --> 27:12.662
I'm in control here.

27:12.840 --> 27:14.000
You holster your weapon

27:14.174 --> 27:16.039
or my partner's gonna
shoot you where you stand.

27:16.218 --> 27:18.083
You wanna die?
You wanna die?

27:18.262 --> 27:20.469
- Billy, I think--
- Shut the fuck up!

27:22.015 --> 27:23.505
You wanna die?

27:31.692 --> 27:34.024
Tie your dog on the--
on the pole over there.

27:34.194 --> 27:36.185
I want you to turn around
and I want you to kneel down

27:36.363 --> 27:38.729
and interlock your fingers
behind your head.

27:38.907 --> 27:42.741
Take the kid over here,
then you hand him over to Officer Burke.

27:46.582 --> 27:48.243
Let's go. On your knees.

27:48.417 --> 27:51.500
On your knees!
Hands behind your head.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.035
Do it now!

27:53.213 --> 27:55.329
- Hey hey hey.
- Tough guy, huh?

27:55.507 --> 27:57.463
You're lucky I didn't
haul your ass off, punk.

27:58.468 --> 27:59.924
Hey!

28:01.263 --> 28:04.050
- Oh my God!
- What's up now, pussy? Huh?

28:04.224 --> 28:06.886
- I ain't even do nothing, son.
- Fuck.

28:07.060 --> 28:09.392
This motherfucker wanna eat me.
You think I'm a monkey, huh?

28:09.563 --> 28:12.270
Ricky, you know me, man.
Don't do this.

28:12.441 --> 28:14.682
Don't test me, Malo.
Don't test me.

28:14.860 --> 28:17.192
You're right--
dude wants to end you.

28:17.362 --> 28:18.772
I ain't gonna let it go like that.

28:18.947 --> 28:21.438
Easy, let the OG take you in.

28:21.617 --> 28:24.154
Put the gun down.
Come on, son.

28:24.328 --> 28:26.569
It's gonna get bad for you out here.

28:35.047 --> 28:36.753
You oughta be locking up that cop!

28:36.924 --> 28:38.130
You're welcome.

28:38.300 --> 28:40.837
On your knees. Let's go.

28:41.011 --> 28:42.342
- On your knees.
- Hey.

28:42.512 --> 28:44.468
- Easy.
- Hands behind your head.

28:45.515 --> 28:47.426
Hands behind your head!

28:52.314 --> 28:54.976
Hey hey hey!

28:59.613 --> 29:01.103
Stand down.

29:04.201 --> 29:05.611
They're not messing around.

29:05.786 --> 29:08.027
Don't think I'm not
reporting this, Lureu.

29:08.205 --> 29:09.661
Yeah, we all watched you
assault a perp

29:09.831 --> 29:11.867
and my rookie bail
your bitch-ass out,

29:12.042 --> 29:13.452
so why don't you put that
in your report?

29:13.627 --> 29:15.868
You're mine.
Get in the fucking cruiser.

29:20.467 --> 29:22.423
Punk.

29:33.897 --> 29:36.058
Do me a favor--
uncuff him, will you?

29:37.818 --> 29:39.274
Uncuff him.

29:39.444 --> 29:41.150
- Do you really want me to?
- Yeah.

29:45.575 --> 29:47.816
- He's my new partner Malo.
- 'Sup?

29:47.995 --> 29:50.111
- Yeah.
- You carrying?

29:50.289 --> 29:51.950
Of course, Lureu.
You know I always got you.

29:52.124 --> 29:54.080
You lucky that I showed up when I did,
'cause you know

29:54.251 --> 29:55.957
that redneck was gonna
rape you with a stick.

29:56.128 --> 29:58.210
You know that, right?

29:58.380 --> 30:01.543
All right, you owe me.

30:01.717 --> 30:04.504
This your stop. Get out.

30:08.682 --> 30:11.765
- You sure you don't party?
- Not with that shit.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.426
Yeah well,

30:14.604 --> 30:17.220
when you've seen enough shit
and you've done enough shit,

30:18.275 --> 30:19.765
you change your mind.

30:19.943 --> 30:22.355
Till then, don't judge me
if you're gonna be

30:22.529 --> 30:24.861
- sitting right next to me.
- I'm not judging you.

30:26.366 --> 30:27.981
You will soon.

30:32.039 --> 30:33.995
Just once I'd like to know
what it feels like

30:34.166 --> 30:36.373
not to have a brown face
in the back back there.

30:36.543 --> 30:40.331
Now your mama gotta hide her face every
time she go out on the street, huh?

30:40.505 --> 30:42.211
Uncuff him, Officer.

30:42.382 --> 30:43.838
Excuse me?

30:44.009 --> 30:46.546
I said take the shackles
off the young boy's wrists.

30:51.391 --> 30:54.724
And give this to him.
It's his stuff.

31:02.402 --> 31:03.767
Come on, man.

31:04.821 --> 31:06.561
And look,
keep your head on you, okay?

31:06.740 --> 31:10.198
- We're letting you off this time.
- Hey, come on.

31:11.870 --> 31:14.111
It ain't always gonna be like this.

31:20.170 --> 31:21.751
Wow.

31:21.922 --> 31:24.664
I thought we were supposed
to keep cats like that off the streets.

31:24.841 --> 31:26.251
- No.
- You know, I thought that--

31:26.426 --> 31:28.587
No no, tell me,
what would you have done, Officer,

31:28.762 --> 31:30.423
if you had six guns
pointed at your head

31:30.597 --> 31:33.304
and a crazy-ass cracker
trying to take you in? Huh?

31:33.475 --> 31:35.932
- Remember Abner Louima.
- Why did we let him go?

31:36.103 --> 31:38.640
- I mean, he--
- No, he's gonna be better off

31:38.814 --> 31:41.601
out here than he is inside that system.
Trust me on that.

31:43.318 --> 31:45.104
But that's not
our decision to make, sir.

31:45.278 --> 31:47.109
- No. Look, let me tell you something.
- You know, that's--

31:47.280 --> 31:48.861
A few years inside that system

31:49.032 --> 31:50.897
and he would've
been desperate enough

31:51.076 --> 31:53.488
to pull that trigger
just not to go back inside.

31:54.955 --> 31:57.037
Now this lesson just ain't for him.

31:57.207 --> 31:59.038
It's for you too.

32:02.629 --> 32:04.290
Yes sir.

32:16.643 --> 32:19.635
I'm getting money,
yeah, I'm getting money

32:19.813 --> 32:23.021
You niggas 'bout a dollar,
I'm 'bout a hundred

32:23.191 --> 32:25.933
I'm getting money,
yeah, I'm getting money

32:26.111 --> 32:30.730
Mr. Hundred Grand, popping them
dollars out of rubber bands

32:30.907 --> 32:33.398
I'm getting money,
l-l-l-- I'm getting money

32:33.577 --> 32:36.660
I'm getting money, l-l-l--
I'm getting money

32:36.830 --> 32:39.993
I'm getting money,
l-l-l-- I'm getting money

32:40.167 --> 32:42.499
I'm getting money, l-l-l--
I'm getting money...

32:42.669 --> 32:45.661
Cash on delivery,
they call me the Postman

32:45.839 --> 32:47.500
I'm a stunner,
bread and butter...

32:47.674 --> 32:49.255
You tap Joey yet?

32:50.302 --> 32:51.758
What?

32:51.928 --> 32:54.670
Joey, the bartender?

32:54.848 --> 32:56.429
I only met her a week ago.

32:56.600 --> 32:58.591
Did you tap Joey yet?

33:01.271 --> 33:02.807
Of course I did.

33:04.774 --> 33:06.264
I knew that shit. Punks.

33:06.443 --> 33:08.855
Everybody in that bar been trying
to crack that ass ever since

33:09.029 --> 33:11.111
she got up in here.
Then you come in here in a week,

33:11.281 --> 33:13.522
slinging your shit around
and you got that.

33:13.700 --> 33:16.112
A couple stacks
in my religious

33:16.286 --> 33:17.992
To help my jeans sag

33:18.163 --> 33:20.996
The chain so icy,
the kid playing freeze tag

33:21.166 --> 33:24.078
She say she like my swag,
I think she got it bad...

33:24.252 --> 33:26.368
Whoa whoa,
what we got up here?

33:28.423 --> 33:30.960
- Let me get that.
- Sit down, rookie.

33:31.134 --> 33:33.250
I'll make the first move,
then you show me what you've got.

33:41.102 --> 33:43.013
Ladies.

33:43.188 --> 33:45.179
You lose your keys?

33:46.441 --> 33:48.102
Shit, I know you ain't trying to holla.

33:48.276 --> 33:50.562
Y'all are too fine to be police, baby.

33:50.737 --> 33:53.228
- What's going on, ladies?
- Her man crazy.

33:53.406 --> 33:55.146
- He ain't my man.
- Your man crazy?

33:55.325 --> 33:58.442
Yeah, so we was out here
last night just chilling,

33:58.620 --> 34:01.077
smoking a blunt.
So I need to holla at my man,

34:01.248 --> 34:02.579
but my phone battery had died,

34:02.749 --> 34:04.785
so I ask Eddie can I use his.

34:04.960 --> 34:06.541
So he let me use it,
but then he's stressing me

34:06.711 --> 34:08.793
on these minutes and shit, right?
So we got to yelling.

34:08.964 --> 34:11.330
Then po-po rolls up, talking about
disturbing the peace and shit

34:11.507 --> 34:12.839
and that they about to take us in.

34:13.009 --> 34:14.873
Anyhow, Eddie got put
in the system last night,

34:15.053 --> 34:17.339
got locked up with the key to this house
and my shit's still in there.

34:17.514 --> 34:19.175
You know what?
Enough of that, a'ight?

34:19.349 --> 34:21.761
- Show me some lD.
- What you want my lD for?

34:21.935 --> 34:23.266
Just give me some lD, all right?

34:23.436 --> 34:25.176
Hey, shit.

34:26.273 --> 34:27.934
Here.

34:29.484 --> 34:32.100
What does Eddie do?
Eddie sling rock?

34:34.697 --> 34:36.654
Answer my partner.

34:36.824 --> 34:38.940
No, Eddie sells weed.

34:47.585 --> 34:51.329
There's somethin' in here.
You smell it?

34:53.800 --> 34:56.132
- Get your shit and get outta here.
- Hey, gimme a fucking minute.

34:56.303 --> 34:57.509
Wait a motherfucking minute? Shit.

34:57.679 --> 34:59.294
Make sure these ladies
get outta here, a'ight?

34:59.472 --> 35:01.133
God.

35:01.308 --> 35:03.890
- Just a minute.
- Just get your shit and let's go.

35:04.060 --> 35:06.016
God damn it.

35:09.190 --> 35:11.021
Where is my fuckin'--?

35:11.192 --> 35:13.023
I don't fucking know.
Maybe he took it.

35:13.194 --> 35:14.934
Yeah yeah,
I don't see my shit. Any of it.

35:15.113 --> 35:16.603
Am I fucking seeing
my man's shit, anyway?

35:16.781 --> 35:18.567
I thought you said
Eddie wasn't your man?

35:18.742 --> 35:20.232
Okay, all right, look--

35:20.410 --> 35:21.991
Hey, man, what the fuck you doing?

35:25.081 --> 35:26.366
Oh shit.

35:26.541 --> 35:28.077
Oh shit.
I'm not gonna tell.

35:28.251 --> 35:30.492
I ain't gonna say nothing.
I swear I'm not.

35:30.670 --> 35:33.207
She ran off with your balls, kid.

35:34.591 --> 35:36.673
Help me!

35:46.144 --> 35:47.429
Oh, no no!

35:50.023 --> 35:51.263
Please!

35:54.110 --> 35:56.192
Holy shit. Shit.

36:05.705 --> 36:08.037
Grandma, is she dead?

36:10.919 --> 36:13.001
Move back.

36:13.171 --> 36:14.877
Somebody call 91 1.

36:23.306 --> 36:25.217
First time seeing a face get split?

36:25.392 --> 36:26.552
No.

36:28.395 --> 36:31.683
Here's your cut plus

36:31.856 --> 36:36.065
a little cherry-popping bonus.

36:37.487 --> 36:39.569
Another good day.

36:40.990 --> 36:43.356
- How about my cut of the weed?
- Yo.

36:43.535 --> 36:45.742
No no, we'll sell Eddie's stash
to one of his competitors,

36:45.912 --> 36:48.654
we make a bundle of cash-- unless you've
got a better idea. I'm all ears.

36:48.832 --> 36:51.073
Let's bail Eddie out,
sell his product back to him.

36:51.251 --> 36:52.957
We put him back in business
working for us,

36:53.128 --> 36:55.210
take a cut off the top.
Win-win for everybody.

36:55.380 --> 36:56.995
You know,
I was right about you.

36:57.173 --> 36:59.164
You're charmed.
I love this kid.

36:59.342 --> 37:00.923
Today was a good day.

37:01.094 --> 37:03.301
You guys go out,
have a good time, celebrate.

37:24.075 --> 37:25.690
Welcome to my shade, here.

37:25.869 --> 37:27.905
- This is your spot?
- This is it.

37:30.415 --> 37:33.498
"D" is for the diamonds,
"O" is for the owes

37:33.668 --> 37:36.660
"P" is for the paper,
"E" is for everything...

37:36.838 --> 37:38.248
Hi.

37:39.382 --> 37:41.338
Take a seat, all right? Relax.

37:44.804 --> 37:46.715
Hi.

37:46.890 --> 37:49.597
I see you brought a friend.
To the back.

37:49.768 --> 37:51.304
I'll get you set up.

37:52.562 --> 37:55.520
Oh. Enjoy, a'ight?
It's on me.

37:55.690 --> 37:59.558
Thank you very much,
you are very welcome

37:59.736 --> 38:02.694
For not supporting
and never helping

38:02.864 --> 38:05.822
I live the dream, so when I sleep
there's only nightmares...

38:05.992 --> 38:07.072
- Thanks.
- Like when the police found

38:07.243 --> 38:09.199
That cocaine in my Nike Airs

38:09.370 --> 38:12.328
I went from steel handcuffs
to diamond bracelets

38:12.499 --> 38:14.080
When no one else
would bail me out

38:14.250 --> 38:15.865
My nigga Johnny Blaze did

38:16.044 --> 38:18.660
That's why I take him
everywhere with me

38:18.838 --> 38:20.954
Even let him blow my last 50

38:21.132 --> 38:22.668
No problem

38:22.842 --> 38:25.208
On my way to heaven
to fuck your goddess

38:25.386 --> 38:28.594
And if we ever go broke,
pray to the snow gods

38:28.765 --> 38:31.222
Here go some money, baby,
have a good time

38:31.392 --> 38:33.974
I gotta go change the world
one pound at a time

38:34.145 --> 38:36.352
Selling dope,
"D" is for the diamonds

38:36.523 --> 38:38.684
"O" is for the owes

38:38.858 --> 38:41.474
"P" is for the paper,
"E" is for everything

38:41.653 --> 38:44.861
Dope gave me everything

38:45.031 --> 38:48.068
Dope, thanks for everything

38:48.243 --> 38:51.201
"D" is for the diamonds,
"O" is for the owes

38:51.371 --> 38:54.534
"P" is for the paper,
"E" is for everything

38:54.707 --> 38:57.824
Dope, you gave me everything

38:58.002 --> 39:01.369
Dope,
thanks for everything.

39:27.156 --> 39:28.942
I like driving around with you, Pop.

39:29.117 --> 39:30.778
Yeah, I bet you do.

39:40.169 --> 39:41.534
Show me your hands.

39:42.672 --> 39:44.378
It's dead out here.

39:44.549 --> 39:46.289
We got a little carried away.

39:46.467 --> 39:48.674
We didn't mean any harm.

39:49.804 --> 39:51.590
- Have a safe night.
- Jonas,

39:51.764 --> 39:53.345
you know what your pop
does for a living, right?

39:53.516 --> 39:55.598
You're a good guy, Pop.

39:55.768 --> 39:58.384
That's right.
This badge makes me bulletproof.

40:00.773 --> 40:03.389
In this life, sometimes you gotta
take what should be given.

40:03.568 --> 40:04.774
You understand?

40:04.944 --> 40:07.731
Always keep sock money
around for a rainy day.

40:16.205 --> 40:17.411
Come on in.

40:21.002 --> 40:22.458
You want that respect?

40:22.629 --> 40:24.244
It's not about the power,
it's about the form.

40:24.422 --> 40:26.629
Practice makes perfect here.

40:26.799 --> 40:29.336
There you go.
that's nice for-- whoa!

40:29.510 --> 40:32.377
Oh! What's going on, man?

40:32.555 --> 40:34.591
What's up? Yo, what's up?
What's going on?

40:34.766 --> 40:36.472
- What y'all doing over here?
- Everything good?

40:36.643 --> 40:38.179
- Yeah yeah.
- Hey, watch your elbow, man.

40:38.353 --> 40:40.014
You gotta make sure
he get the forms right.

40:40.188 --> 40:41.519
Hey hey, listen to this man.

40:41.689 --> 40:43.270
He was a dope QB in high school.

40:43.441 --> 40:44.851
Yo, this is so you right now.

40:45.026 --> 40:47.984
It feels good.
Hey, let's get out of this sun, man.

40:50.239 --> 40:53.072
- Oof.
- It's hot out there.

40:54.661 --> 40:56.777
Yo, remember when
we used to get out of doing laps

40:56.955 --> 40:59.492
by bribing Coach Bishop with bagels
from Cyn's dad's diner?

40:59.666 --> 41:01.827
Yo yo, actually, speaking of Cyn,

41:02.001 --> 41:03.741
- you talk to her lately?
- Nah, I ain't speak to her.

41:03.920 --> 41:05.660
Yo, all I know

41:05.838 --> 41:07.544
is that your TO is fucking crazy.

41:07.715 --> 41:09.046
- Look who talking.
- Yeah.

41:09.217 --> 41:11.048
Yo, would you have

41:11.219 --> 41:13.210
really shot Morrison
if your TO told you to?

41:13.388 --> 41:16.130
Man, y'all got no idea
what goes on in my squad.

41:16.307 --> 41:18.923
Dudes is eating,
and they're getting real money.

41:19.102 --> 41:21.468
People in the mayor's office
answer my boss's calls.

41:21.646 --> 41:24.729
- The shit is crazy.
- I thought we were supposed to be

41:24.899 --> 41:26.981
- each other's eyes, ears and fists.
- Mm-hmm.

41:27.151 --> 41:28.857
That's why I gotta
get y'all on this squad.

41:29.028 --> 41:30.859
Yo, can you please
make that happen

41:31.030 --> 41:32.895
before my crazy TO gets me killed?

41:33.074 --> 41:34.780
Yeah, I'm down.

41:34.951 --> 41:37.784
I'm heading over there later.
Lemme see what I can do.

41:55.638 --> 41:56.969
Yo, lemme get some.

42:05.148 --> 42:08.015
Yo, I guess you didn't get the message
the last time, you little bitch.

42:08.192 --> 42:09.898
Oh shit!

42:16.451 --> 42:17.987
Oh shit!

42:26.836 --> 42:28.451
Fuck.

42:43.311 --> 42:44.767
Hyah!

43:26.646 --> 43:28.386
Fuck you!

43:53.172 --> 43:54.628
Get up.

44:04.767 --> 44:06.598
I'm doing right by this kid, right?

44:06.769 --> 44:09.806
Yeah, you doing right by him.
I understand.

44:09.981 --> 44:12.438
Having junior around helps
keep your conscience clean.

44:13.985 --> 44:16.317
You trust him, all right?

44:19.365 --> 44:22.528
- Hey, what's that?
- Homework.

44:22.702 --> 44:26.536
John Jay, student,
criminal psychology.

44:26.706 --> 44:28.742
Do you remember anything?

44:28.916 --> 44:30.452
No.

44:32.962 --> 44:35.044
- I wanna test him.
- Yeah?

44:35.214 --> 44:36.875
Just give him something to do,
give him something small.

44:37.049 --> 44:40.382
- Something small? Yeah. Mmm.
- Yeah.

44:41.429 --> 44:43.135
This is why I don't date cops.

44:43.306 --> 44:45.388
They're too self-absorbed.

44:45.558 --> 44:46.718
- What?
- Nothing.

44:52.481 --> 44:55.223
So you arresting thugs
on the street now?

44:55.401 --> 44:57.562
You can't call yourself a man
and deal drugs to children

44:57.737 --> 45:00.228
and mothers pushing strollers.

45:00.406 --> 45:01.896
That's a piece of shit.

45:03.201 --> 45:05.738
You calling me a piece of shit now?

45:08.748 --> 45:10.909
Huh? Ah!

45:11.083 --> 45:12.289
I'm fucking with you.

45:12.460 --> 45:14.917
But don't fuck
with our representatives

45:15.087 --> 45:16.873
on the street--
that's most important.

45:17.048 --> 45:18.163
- Huh?
- Cool.

45:18.341 --> 45:19.421
You want a chance to move up?

45:19.592 --> 45:21.503
No doubt. You know that.

45:21.677 --> 45:23.338
Go here...

45:24.388 --> 45:25.969
come back with my money.

45:26.140 --> 45:27.676
You mind if I bring my boys with me?

45:27.850 --> 45:28.965
That's how we do it here.

45:30.144 --> 45:31.680
You vouch for 'em, sure, it's okay.

45:31.854 --> 45:33.936
- They're like my brothers.
- Okay.

45:34.106 --> 45:36.267
It's the first time
you're gonna meet this guy.

45:36.442 --> 45:39.275
I want you to lean on him
and be felt. Understood?

45:39.445 --> 45:40.605
Yes sir.

45:41.697 --> 45:43.233
Important.

45:43.407 --> 45:46.649
- Go ahead.
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa.

45:46.827 --> 45:48.818
You ready, Malo?

45:50.122 --> 45:51.282
Go ahead. Go go.

46:06.597 --> 46:08.588
Hold the fuck on!

46:12.353 --> 46:14.514
Ah!

46:16.983 --> 46:19.816
Oh fuck!

46:19.986 --> 46:22.352
- Whoa, fucking slow down.
- You Sully?

46:22.530 --> 46:24.771
- Yeah, I'm Sully.
- G'day, mate.

46:24.949 --> 46:27.440
Do I look like a fucking kangaroo
to you, you prick?

46:27.618 --> 46:30.325
- Who the fuck are you guys?
- We're the new crew.

46:30.496 --> 46:32.077
- Is that right?
- Whoa whoa whoa.

46:32.248 --> 46:34.159
- Easy easy now.
- I wish you would.

46:34.333 --> 46:36.699
Whoa.

46:36.877 --> 46:39.539
We're here to collect Sarcone's money.

46:39.714 --> 46:41.329
Sarcone.

46:42.633 --> 46:45.170
- Where's Lureu?
- Like the man said,

46:45.344 --> 46:48.006
- we're the new crew.
- Just tell us where the money's at.

46:49.348 --> 46:51.088
On the table.

46:58.816 --> 47:00.932
Yeah, we good.
Let's get out of here.

47:01.110 --> 47:03.692
- Listen to your partner.
- Or what?

47:05.698 --> 47:07.939
Or I'm gonna get really pissed.

47:08.117 --> 47:10.733
You ain't scared, huh?

47:10.911 --> 47:13.527
Are you some kind of tough guy?
You hiding something from Joe?

47:13.706 --> 47:15.867
I ain't hiding nothing

47:16.042 --> 47:17.873
and I've got too much
on Sarcone to worry about him.

47:18.044 --> 47:19.784
So let me tell you this:.

47:19.962 --> 47:21.873
fuck you, fuck you

47:22.048 --> 47:23.538
and fuck you!

47:28.846 --> 47:31.588
Oh shit! You're gonna go
fucking down, you fuckers!

47:31.766 --> 47:33.927
- You're gonna pay for that!
- Come on, grab his foot!

47:34.101 --> 47:36.638
- Get me up, you motherfuckers!
- Are you scared yet, motherfucker?

47:36.812 --> 47:38.894
I'm scared for you.

47:39.065 --> 47:41.147
- You gonna fly, motherfucker!
- I'm gonna drop your ass.

47:41.317 --> 47:43.478
- You ain't talking shit now.
- Get me up, you fuckers!

47:43.652 --> 47:45.392
- You ain't talking shit now, right?
- You motherfuckers!

47:45.571 --> 47:47.653
Help me get him in.
Get your ass over here.

47:47.823 --> 47:49.814
You gonna tell me why
you ain't scared of Sarcone,

47:49.992 --> 47:52.278
or I'm gonna fly your ass
out that window like a kite.

47:53.287 --> 47:55.118
I'm more worried about Baez.

47:55.289 --> 47:56.745
Who?

47:58.334 --> 48:00.950
You work for Sarcone,
but you don't know who the real boss is.

48:01.128 --> 48:03.995
His boss, my boss, your boss--

48:04.173 --> 48:06.084
Gabriel Baez.

48:07.301 --> 48:09.587
What you know about Sarcone--
times it by 1 0,

48:09.762 --> 48:11.718
don't even come close to Baez.

48:11.889 --> 48:14.551
- Sarcone got a handler?
- Everyone's got a boss.

48:14.725 --> 48:18.217
Baez has been importing product
into the city for 20 years.

48:18.396 --> 48:21.809
He pays Joe to make sure the traffic
route is all nice and friendly.

48:21.982 --> 48:24.268
Joe used to be the escort.

48:24.443 --> 48:27.810
That's my job now.
I pay him on the back end.

48:27.988 --> 48:30.229
I know spots
of cash that Sarcone--

48:30.408 --> 48:32.945
- he doesn't even know about.
- Go check the other room.

48:33.119 --> 48:35.906
- You keep talking.
- A few years back

48:36.080 --> 48:39.538
a Queen's ADA tried
to put the squeeze on Joe.

48:39.708 --> 48:42.120
Even got an old cop to rat on him.

48:43.629 --> 48:44.914
It didn't stick.

48:45.089 --> 48:46.750
He's still walking the streets.

48:46.924 --> 48:48.460
The aftermath--

48:48.634 --> 48:50.374
everybody that was involved

48:50.553 --> 48:53.044
- went to an early grave.
- You a cop?

48:53.222 --> 48:56.089
No. You just don't get it.

48:56.267 --> 48:59.009
You're his new trained dog.

49:00.855 --> 49:03.267
He'll get you used
to the white powder.

49:04.817 --> 49:07.524
And he'll use you just like
he has all his other dogs.

49:09.572 --> 49:11.654
And you thought Joe was your friend.

49:11.824 --> 49:13.906
Jackpot, baby.

49:15.995 --> 49:19.032
This ain't the half of it.
Who does this belong to?

49:20.082 --> 49:21.492
Technically, my boss.

49:21.667 --> 49:24.329
If he's skimming from Baez
and hiding it from Sarcone,

49:24.503 --> 49:26.710
then that's none
of our business, Malo.

49:26.881 --> 49:28.917
Come on,
we did what we came to do.

49:29.091 --> 49:30.877
Man, let's get out of here.

49:31.051 --> 49:33.212
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
New deal-- you're gonna tell me

49:33.387 --> 49:34.877
where those cash spots is at,
you hear me?

49:35.055 --> 49:37.967
Or I'm gonna tell Sarcone
about your new little side hustle,

49:38.142 --> 49:40.303
and you already know
what he gonna do.

49:41.395 --> 49:42.680
You work for me now.

49:56.368 --> 49:58.859
Here's the money from Sully.

49:59.038 --> 50:02.326
What's the worst thing
you ever did, Joe?

50:02.500 --> 50:05.367
The worst thing I ever did
was trust the wrong man.

50:07.546 --> 50:09.832
How do you know when
you trusting the wrong man?

50:11.592 --> 50:12.581
You're questioning me?

50:12.760 --> 50:15.046
Huh? You little shit.

50:15.221 --> 50:18.304
I always made my decision
with my head, not my heart.

50:18.474 --> 50:20.681
I got to where I am in this world
by taking advantage

50:20.851 --> 50:22.967
of people's trust,
and I'm not ashamed of that.

50:24.230 --> 50:26.812
I have a question for you.
Are your boys loyal to you?

50:26.982 --> 50:29.268
- Absolutely.
- Yeah?

50:30.569 --> 50:32.150
I'm not asking you
to vouch for them.

50:32.321 --> 50:34.403
I'm asking for you
to bet your balls, literally.

50:34.573 --> 50:36.734
- I understand. I do.
- Yeah, do you?

50:36.909 --> 50:38.820
'Cause usually
it's the guy closest to your balls

50:38.994 --> 50:40.655
who winds up kicking you in them.

50:40.829 --> 50:42.239
I have a rat inside these walls.

50:42.414 --> 50:44.700
That's the news straight
from One Police Plaza.

50:44.875 --> 50:46.831
Someone in my confidence
is cheating on me.

50:47.002 --> 50:49.584
Don't make me wrong to trust you.

50:53.092 --> 50:56.880
I love you like a son,
but if you or anybody near you

50:57.054 --> 50:58.590
double-crosses me...

51:00.015 --> 51:01.721
as long as I have breath in my lungs,

51:01.892 --> 51:04.508
I will find you and I will cook you.

51:04.687 --> 51:07.394
- You don't have to worry about me.
- I'm not worried, kid.

51:07.565 --> 51:09.271
You're confusing worry and concern.

51:09.441 --> 51:12.148
Sometimes it's a woman who winds up
kicking you in the balls the hardest.

51:12.319 --> 51:14.776
- Is that why you're not married?
- You're damn straight.

51:14.947 --> 51:16.608
I don't trust no bitch,
neither should you,

51:16.782 --> 51:19.114
especially not some bitch shaking
her ass for tips in a fucking bar.

51:19.285 --> 51:21.742
- Understood.
- You gotta do what you gotta do, kid.

51:21.912 --> 51:25.200
Use your head, always, and keep
your balls covered. Remember that.

51:26.375 --> 51:28.616
- Am I clear?
- I hear you loud and clear.

51:52.443 --> 51:54.980
- Shots!
- You got it.

51:56.113 --> 51:58.775
Yo, what's the word?
Are we in or what?

51:58.949 --> 52:01.440
Sarcone'll get at me
when he's ready, man.

52:01.619 --> 52:03.610
- Don't stress it.
- Yo, that thing Sully said

52:03.787 --> 52:05.698
- about an ADA from Queens--
- Yeah?

52:05.873 --> 52:07.738
--what are the chances
he was talking about Vecchio?

52:07.916 --> 52:10.373
- Who the fuck cares?
- Gimme two.

52:10.544 --> 52:12.660
If it's true, Sarcone and Baez

52:12.838 --> 52:14.794
got more to lose by not bringing us on.

52:14.965 --> 52:16.546
Am I right?

52:16.717 --> 52:18.708
I'll talk to Lydia tomorrow,
see what's up.

52:18.886 --> 52:22.174
Yo, I seen this fly Spanish girl. Whoa!

52:23.932 --> 52:25.593
Yo, what's up with Cyn, man?

52:25.768 --> 52:28.384
You talk to her lately?
Now you know she loves you.

52:28.562 --> 52:30.974
How long you gonna make her pay
for her family's bullshit?

52:31.148 --> 52:33.355
Look, man,
Cyn's doing Cyn.

52:33.525 --> 52:35.015
Me? I'm doing me.

52:35.194 --> 52:37.059
Let's move.

52:57.675 --> 53:00.838
Yeah, whatever.
But just-- you know, just in case.

53:01.011 --> 53:04.549
Hey. How you doing?

53:05.933 --> 53:08.549
- I'm good. How are you?
- I'm good.

53:08.727 --> 53:10.513
You come here with these clowns?

53:10.688 --> 53:13.680
No, my girlfriend knows
one of the guys.

53:13.857 --> 53:16.223
I just met them.
Is that okay?

53:16.402 --> 53:17.391
Yo, do I know you?

53:19.196 --> 53:20.436
Yo, I'm talking to you.

53:24.535 --> 53:26.275
- No, son, you don't know me.
- Wanna party?

53:29.415 --> 53:33.499
- Ooh. A cop, huh?
- What the fuck?

53:33.669 --> 53:37.002
Shit. His motherfucking badge
don't mean shit in here.

53:38.966 --> 53:40.251
I think she liked it.

53:48.809 --> 53:51.596
- Yo, who invited you here?
- Man, fuck you.

53:51.770 --> 53:54.011
What?! Who the fuck you think
you're talking to?

53:54.189 --> 53:55.178
- Whoa.
- Coming in here with that badge,

53:55.357 --> 53:56.847
thinking you running shit?

53:57.025 --> 53:58.356
- I gotta go.
- You a punk, huh?

53:58.527 --> 54:00.063
You scared? You nervous?

54:02.406 --> 54:04.237
You nervous?!

54:04.408 --> 54:05.898
- Oh shit!
- Pop off!

54:06.076 --> 54:07.816
Why you pulling the gun, white boy?

54:07.995 --> 54:09.531
We all got guns.
Pop off!

54:09.705 --> 54:11.491
- You nervous?!
- You gonna shoot all of us?

54:11.665 --> 54:14.407
- You scared, white boy?
- You gonna shoot all of us?

54:18.046 --> 54:19.536
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

54:19.715 --> 54:21.421
- Police! Get the fuck down!
- What did you do?

54:21.592 --> 54:23.878
What the fuck?
Man, put this shit down. What the--

54:24.052 --> 54:26.043
Stupid, man.
We gotta get outta here.

54:26.221 --> 54:28.678
- Come on, man, get out of here.
- Yeah, fuck you!

54:28.849 --> 54:31.340
- Let's go! Let's go! Come on!
- Fuck you!

54:37.608 --> 54:39.815
- What do we do?
- What they gonna do?

54:39.985 --> 54:41.065
They gonna--
they gonna call the cops?

54:41.236 --> 54:43.397
Hey, man,
he's outta control, man.

54:43.572 --> 54:44.937
It's always the same shit
with this dude.

55:24.488 --> 55:26.274
Mix some up.

55:28.325 --> 55:29.815
You really think
I wouldn't have found out

55:29.993 --> 55:31.824
about your boy shooting
two people at a party?

55:31.995 --> 55:34.031
In front of witnesses? Huh?

55:34.206 --> 55:36.162
- Huh?
- Answer the man.

55:36.333 --> 55:38.198
Your fucking boy's an idiot.

55:38.377 --> 55:40.834
He's a fucking idiot.
You understand that?

55:41.004 --> 55:42.619
He ain't under
my protection like you.

55:42.798 --> 55:44.914
He can get you fucked up.
He can fuck me up.

55:45.092 --> 55:47.629
- He got excited. I'll calm him down.
- He got excited?

55:47.803 --> 55:49.384
He got excited?

55:52.057 --> 55:54.093
I made some calls.
Last night never happened.

55:54.268 --> 55:57.385
I like you, Malo.
Up until now I trusted your judgment.

55:57.563 --> 55:59.519
I know you want him around
because he's your friend,

55:59.690 --> 56:01.146
but if I ever hear
of him fucking up again,

56:01.316 --> 56:03.432
that's it.
It's over.

56:03.610 --> 56:05.475
You understand?

56:05.654 --> 56:07.690
- Let me hear you say it!
- Yes, I understand.

56:07.865 --> 56:10.197
Let me tell you something right now--
you work for me!

56:10.367 --> 56:11.982
Only me, not yourself!

56:12.160 --> 56:14.242
You do what I say!

56:15.247 --> 56:16.236
Snort that line.

56:17.958 --> 56:20.199
Snort the fucking line!

56:28.802 --> 56:30.292
The other one.

56:35.350 --> 56:37.932
- You just don't get it.
- Your boy's a fucking idiot.

56:38.103 --> 56:39.968
- You're his new trained dog.
- He's a fucking idiot.

56:40.147 --> 56:42.058
That thing Sully said
about an ADA from Queens.

56:42.232 --> 56:43.347
He'll get you used to the white powder.

56:43.525 --> 56:44.605
He ain't under my protection.

56:44.776 --> 56:46.437
What are the chances
he was talking about Vecchio?

56:46.612 --> 56:48.477
He can fuck you up.
He can fuck me up. I like you, Malo.

56:48.655 --> 56:50.236
Up till now, I trusted your judgment.
You work for me!

56:50.407 --> 56:52.318
Only me!
Let me hear you say it.

56:53.619 --> 56:54.859
Get outta here.

57:00.000 --> 57:01.956
This fucking kid.

57:25.150 --> 57:26.731
Hey.

57:32.282 --> 57:34.147
I knew you'd call eventually.

57:35.160 --> 57:37.116
You got your wish.

57:38.705 --> 57:40.661
I appreciate everything
you did for me, Lydia,

57:40.832 --> 57:43.915
but I called because I needed
to talk to you about your husband.

57:44.086 --> 57:46.168
What happened to him?

57:46.338 --> 57:47.748
How'd he die?

57:50.550 --> 57:52.256
Kenneth was very ambitious.

57:53.679 --> 57:55.340
He was looking for something big,

57:55.514 --> 57:57.926
something that would
make him a legal rock star.

57:59.851 --> 58:02.092
Then he'd be DA or mayor

58:02.270 --> 58:04.602
or God knows what. Governor?

58:06.441 --> 58:09.729
- So what happened?
- He got what he wanted.

58:09.903 --> 58:12.565
He was approached by a DEA agent

58:12.739 --> 58:14.354
who wanted help in

58:14.533 --> 58:18.651
building a case against
corrupt New York City cops.

58:18.829 --> 58:20.785
Kenneth jumped at the chance.

58:22.040 --> 58:23.530
So how'd he die?

58:23.709 --> 58:25.370
Not well.

58:25.544 --> 58:28.035
They called it a no-note suicide.

58:30.382 --> 58:33.340
Not leaving a note
for me I understand, but...

58:35.721 --> 58:38.713
nothing for his son,
his daughter?

58:38.890 --> 58:42.098
No, that's not Kenneth.

58:44.896 --> 58:48.059
I met Agent Robert Jude
at Kenneth's wake.

58:49.484 --> 58:52.442
He showed me what Kenneth kept
locked away in his office--

58:53.739 --> 58:55.104
a dossier

58:56.158 --> 58:58.695
on one Captain Joseph Sarcone.

58:58.869 --> 59:01.406
Audio, video surveillance,

59:01.580 --> 59:05.072
notebooks with names,
dates, locations.

59:05.250 --> 59:08.959
Basically, he was
a drug dealer in a uniform.

59:09.129 --> 59:11.370
And he had two partners.

59:14.259 --> 59:15.749
Baby, don't be naive.

59:15.927 --> 59:18.339
My husband found
your father's weak spot.

59:18.513 --> 59:20.674
He convinced him
that you were in danger.

59:22.517 --> 59:25.259
He got him to talk on record about

59:25.437 --> 59:28.679
Sarcone and all the shit
they'd been involved in.

59:30.025 --> 59:32.937
That's why my husband
got you into the academy.

59:33.111 --> 59:35.272
He felt guilty.

59:37.449 --> 59:38.814
Guilty for what?

59:38.992 --> 59:42.200
How do you think your father died?

59:42.370 --> 59:44.452
How do you think Kenneth died?

59:45.749 --> 59:47.489
Sarcone's not your friend.

59:48.585 --> 59:50.291
Sarcone's been like a father to me.

59:50.462 --> 59:52.327
Yeah? How long is that gonna last?

01:00:12.984 --> 01:00:14.520
My name is Daniel Maldonado.

01:00:14.694 --> 01:00:17.356
I'm a detective for the New York City
Police Department.

01:00:18.865 --> 01:00:20.355
And the reason
you've come to us here today?

01:00:20.534 --> 01:00:24.618
My partners
Dennis Lureu and Joe Sarcone,

01:00:24.788 --> 01:00:26.369
and myself,

01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:29.247
work for the drug cartel boss
Gabriel Baez.

01:00:29.417 --> 01:00:31.874
While on duty,
we transported cocaine, marijuana

01:00:32.045 --> 01:00:33.626
and worked as bodyguards
and hired guns

01:00:33.797 --> 01:00:35.253
for Gabriel Baez
for the past seven years.

01:00:35.423 --> 01:00:37.914
And now I'm afraid
for the life of my wife and my son.

01:00:38.093 --> 01:00:40.209
- I love you, Pop.
- I love you too, Jonas.

01:00:40.387 --> 01:00:43.220
If Sarcone found out I was
talking to ADA Vecchio,

01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:46.006
trying to build a case against him,
they'd fucking kill me.

01:00:46.184 --> 01:00:48.300
Climb in the back.
Climb in the back and hide on the floor.

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:50.434
Come on.
And keep quiet. Not a peep.

01:00:50.605 --> 01:00:53.938
- Oh yo, man. It's you guys.
- Get out of the car.

01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:56.521
Come on, I'm just picking up
a little sock money. It's nothing.

01:00:56.695 --> 01:00:58.185
Don't force my hand here.

01:00:58.363 --> 01:00:59.978
Danny-- you crossed the line, Danny.

01:01:00.157 --> 01:01:01.613
Now get the fuck out of the car.

01:01:02.868 --> 01:01:04.654
Your dad and me were partners.

01:01:05.787 --> 01:01:07.778
I love you like a son.

01:01:07.956 --> 01:01:09.912
If this is about the money,
here, take a piece.

01:01:10.083 --> 01:01:11.869
It's not about the money, Danny.

01:01:12.043 --> 01:01:13.829
If it ain't about the dough,
then what the hell is it about?

01:01:14.004 --> 01:01:15.960
It's about loyalty.

01:01:18.008 --> 01:01:21.421
You son of a bitch.
You son of a bitch.

01:01:21.595 --> 01:01:24.052
Why? Wait! Wait a minute!

01:01:29.936 --> 01:01:32.143
Pop, how can I get you out of there?

01:01:32.314 --> 01:01:33.599
I'm fine.

01:01:33.773 --> 01:01:35.434
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:01:35.609 --> 01:01:37.770
Don't worry about me.
Now get out of the car.

01:01:37.944 --> 01:01:40.731
- No, Pop. No. I'm not leaving you!
- Get away from here!

01:01:40.906 --> 01:01:44.615
Do it now!
Jonas, do what I tell you, son!

01:02:01.676 --> 01:02:03.337
So I want this recorded

01:02:03.511 --> 01:02:05.593
in case something happens to me.

01:02:12.479 --> 01:02:14.310
Thank you, Karen.
Send him in.

01:02:14.481 --> 01:02:16.563
Have a seat.

01:02:18.485 --> 01:02:21.773
Daniel Maldonado's son
finally reaches out.

01:02:23.531 --> 01:02:25.738
There's no such thing
as coincidence, right?

01:02:25.909 --> 01:02:27.740
Your phone number was in the file

01:02:27.911 --> 01:02:29.447
Lydia Vecchio gave me.

01:02:29.621 --> 01:02:31.486
That's right.

01:02:31.665 --> 01:02:33.656
All those pictures,

01:02:33.833 --> 01:02:35.664
my father's confession--

01:02:35.835 --> 01:02:38.372
none of that was enough
to put Sarcone away?

01:02:40.799 --> 01:02:43.131
I want Sarcone more than anyone.

01:02:43.301 --> 01:02:45.792
Sometimes in my business,
you do what you can...

01:02:47.055 --> 01:02:48.795
- hope for the best.
- That's bullshit.

01:02:48.974 --> 01:02:52.307
Something's telling me there's
a little more than hope involved here.

01:02:52.477 --> 01:02:55.560
Your father was trying
to do the right thing.

01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:58.312
So why are you here,
Officer Maldonado?

01:02:59.317 --> 01:03:00.978
Tell me plainly.

01:03:01.152 --> 01:03:04.235
I wanna serve Sarcone
to you on a platter.

01:03:04.406 --> 01:03:06.317
Aha.

01:03:06.491 --> 01:03:08.527
I just need to know how to do it.

01:03:17.752 --> 01:03:20.835
- Who is it?
- It's Jonas.

01:03:33.518 --> 01:03:35.179
Get to the point, Jonas.

01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:39.061
What do you really want for us?

01:03:39.232 --> 01:03:41.723
- What I want?
- Yeah.

01:03:42.902 --> 01:03:44.813
Why are you here, Jonas?

01:03:44.988 --> 01:03:46.194
Huh?

01:03:46.364 --> 01:03:48.946
I mean, am I really what you want?

01:03:52.787 --> 01:03:54.277
Come here.

01:03:56.207 --> 01:03:57.492
Don't be like that.

01:03:57.667 --> 01:03:59.282
I want you, Cyn.

01:03:59.461 --> 01:04:01.201
It's always been you.

01:04:04.049 --> 01:04:05.539
Tell me.

01:04:07.302 --> 01:04:08.792
Tell me.

01:04:09.846 --> 01:04:12.713
Jonas, you never tell me
that you love me.

01:04:14.726 --> 01:04:16.682
I need to hear you say it.

01:04:19.064 --> 01:04:20.429
Say it.

01:04:28.615 --> 01:04:30.901
You're a piece of shit.

01:04:31.076 --> 01:04:32.907
- Come here.
- Get out of my house.

01:04:33.078 --> 01:04:35.569
- Come here.
- Don't you fucking touch me.

01:04:36.623 --> 01:04:38.614
Get out of my house.

01:04:39.918 --> 01:04:42.409
Get out of my house.

01:05:16.162 --> 01:05:17.777
Yeah

01:05:17.956 --> 01:05:20.447
You looking at me
then you see what you see

01:05:20.625 --> 01:05:24.538
I'm like, hey, oh yeah

01:05:24.712 --> 01:05:27.624
And in my city
I'll be running with bulls

01:05:27.799 --> 01:05:30.085
I'm like, hey, oh yeah

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:34.048
You can watch it
from the sideline, oh

01:05:34.222 --> 01:05:37.305
Sideline, oh, sideline

01:05:37.475 --> 01:05:40.933
People watching from the sideline

01:05:41.104 --> 01:05:43.766
Sideline, hey

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:47.103
Hey, nigga, you know I'll be good...

01:05:58.163 --> 01:06:00.028
Morning, baby.

01:06:00.206 --> 01:06:02.492
You want some coffee?

01:06:02.667 --> 01:06:04.498
Coffee?

01:06:12.177 --> 01:06:13.883
What? What's up?

01:06:14.053 --> 01:06:15.964
I just don't trust many people.

01:06:16.139 --> 01:06:18.471
I got a lot going on right now.

01:06:18.641 --> 01:06:20.973
a lotta things
I gotta get done, that's all.

01:06:34.616 --> 01:06:36.447
A.D., what's up?
What you got for me?

01:06:36.618 --> 01:06:38.108
I shook Sully down. I found out

01:06:38.286 --> 01:06:41.323
that Baez launders money
at the Queens Raceway.

01:06:41.498 --> 01:06:43.454
Yo, you ain't gonna believe this.

01:06:43.625 --> 01:06:46.162
You know Cyn's brother Angie?
He's running the place.

01:06:46.336 --> 01:06:48.827
Find Lucas and wait
for my call, all right?

01:06:49.005 --> 01:06:52.042
- A'ight, I'm on it.
- A'ight.

01:06:56.429 --> 01:06:58.135
- Hey.
- Lureu.

01:06:58.306 --> 01:07:00.342
- What's going on?
- I got something.

01:07:00.517 --> 01:07:01.848
Yeah, it's major.

01:07:02.018 --> 01:07:03.599
No, Sarcone don't know nothing about it.

01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:06.182
You trust me, don't you?

01:07:06.356 --> 01:07:08.221
I'll pick you up in 10.

01:07:27.418 --> 01:07:28.908
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:34.210
- Hey.
- How you doing?

01:07:34.384 --> 01:07:36.921
I've been really lucky today
if you need any suggestions.

01:07:37.095 --> 01:07:39.211
Well, I'm actually here
on official police business.

01:07:39.389 --> 01:07:41.175
I'm gonna need you to buzz us
into that back door.

01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:42.885
Let me call upstairs about that.

01:07:43.059 --> 01:07:44.595
Look, if you make that phone call,

01:07:44.769 --> 01:07:46.851
you might as well be an accomplice
to everything that goes on here.

01:07:47.021 --> 01:07:49.603
Yo, they don't pay me enough for this.

01:07:49.774 --> 01:07:51.059
Go around that counter

01:07:51.234 --> 01:07:53.350
- and I'm gonna buzz you in.
- All right

01:08:13.631 --> 01:08:15.792
Brother, stay the fuck down.

01:08:15.967 --> 01:08:17.832
- Where you going? Where you going?
- Fuck.

01:08:18.011 --> 01:08:19.546
Stay there or I'll kick you
in your fucking head.

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:21.426
Chill. Yeah yeah.

01:08:21.598 --> 01:08:24.886
What are you doing with these guys?
Especially this asshole right here?

01:08:25.059 --> 01:08:27.300
- Yo, keep fucking with me, old man.
- You wanna try me?

01:08:27.478 --> 01:08:30.515
I can make you vanish.
Poof! You'll be gone.

01:08:30.689 --> 01:08:32.180
Just say one more
fucking thing, all right?

01:08:32.358 --> 01:08:33.689
Yo, my deal, my crew.
Fuck that.

01:08:33.859 --> 01:08:35.975
This isn't good, kid.
This isn't good.

01:08:36.154 --> 01:08:38.770
You wanna test Joe?
I can't save you.

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:40.904
- Get your ass up.
- A'ight, man.

01:08:41.075 --> 01:08:43.532
- What the fuck, Malo?
- I knew it was just a matter of time

01:08:43.703 --> 01:08:45.488
- before I see you again, Angie.
- Wait, you know this guy?

01:08:45.662 --> 01:08:46.993
- Yeah, I know him.
- Why you didn't tell me you know

01:08:47.165 --> 01:08:49.827
- this guy? What the hell's going on?
- My high school sweetheart--

01:08:50.001 --> 01:08:52.117
this is her brother right here--
Angelo. Angie the Greek.

01:08:52.295 --> 01:08:55.162
He's the one got us started in the game,
hustling a corner, slinging.

01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:56.750
- Right, Angie?
- This is the thanks I get

01:08:56.924 --> 01:08:58.835
- for starting you out?
- Found out his sister fell for me,

01:08:59.010 --> 01:09:02.046
beat her within inches of her life.
Remember that, Angie?

01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:04.928
- A real class act.
- Go to hell, Malo.

01:09:05.099 --> 01:09:06.714
You think I forgot about that autograph

01:09:06.893 --> 01:09:09.259
you signed on my forehead
with that baseball bat? Huh?

01:09:14.484 --> 01:09:16.770
You know who
this place belongs to?

01:09:17.944 --> 01:09:19.354
Gabriel Baez.

01:09:19.529 --> 01:09:21.066
You ever hear of him?

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:22.821
This is Gabriel Baez's place?

01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:25.733
You know who Gabriel Baez is?

01:09:25.912 --> 01:09:28.278
We work with this guy, for God's sake.

01:09:28.456 --> 01:09:29.912
A'ight, a'ight, look,

01:09:30.082 --> 01:09:33.416
Iet's-- let's just get outta here.

01:09:33.586 --> 01:09:34.951
- Don't touch a fucking thing.
- Easy easy.

01:09:35.129 --> 01:09:37.415
- Whoa whoa whoa.
- You gonna let 'em put guns in my face?

01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:38.796
You gonna put a gun
in my fucking face?

01:09:38.966 --> 01:09:40.456
You better listen to him, Malo,

01:09:40.635 --> 01:09:42.125
'cause when Baez finds you,
he's gonna watch me

01:09:42.303 --> 01:09:44.635
fist you with this hand
right before he kills you.

01:09:44.805 --> 01:09:46.636
Are you high?

01:09:46.808 --> 01:09:48.548
Are you high?
You wanna make a move on Joe?

01:09:48.725 --> 01:09:50.182
After Joe's finished with you,

01:09:50.353 --> 01:09:51.718
there ain't gonna be nothing left
for Baez to hurt.

01:09:51.895 --> 01:09:55.104
- Do you hear me, kid?
- You're a cop?

01:09:56.901 --> 01:09:59.017
That's funny.

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:01.561
Come on, Malo. There's enough money
to go around for all of us, man.

01:10:01.739 --> 01:10:03.525
- You ain't gotta do this.
- Shut the fuck up.

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:05.656
- You still mad? That was years ago.
- Now look at you.

01:10:05.827 --> 01:10:08.364
- For Christ's sake, do something!
- Don't do it.

01:10:08.538 --> 01:10:10.574
- Shoot that pig!
- We ain't here for that, man!

01:10:10.748 --> 01:10:12.488
Do it!

01:10:12.667 --> 01:10:15.409
- Shit!
- It's a big mistake, kid.

01:10:15.586 --> 01:10:18.043
What the fuck is wrong with you?
What are you thinking about?

01:10:20.508 --> 01:10:21.839
Yeah!

01:10:22.009 --> 01:10:23.249
What the fuck, man?

01:10:23.428 --> 01:10:25.339
Get some rope or something.
Tie him up.

01:10:26.723 --> 01:10:28.964
- Take all that shit.
- Oh shit, man.

01:10:39.569 --> 01:10:42.402
Adios, old friend.

01:10:46.451 --> 01:10:48.863
I don't know, man.

01:10:49.036 --> 01:10:51.118
- You sure about this, Malo?
- Of course I'm sure.

01:10:51.289 --> 01:10:54.247
- You got something you wanna say?
- Yo, I don't give a fuck.

01:10:54.417 --> 01:10:56.624
Come on, let's go.

01:11:02.633 --> 01:11:04.999
We are exactly where
we're supposed to be, my friends.

01:11:05.178 --> 01:11:07.009
The sky's the limit, right?

01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:09.546
I don't think so anymore.

01:11:09.724 --> 01:11:11.385
Hey, remember when we were kids

01:11:11.559 --> 01:11:13.515
and we used to play cops
and robbers in the rain?

01:11:13.686 --> 01:11:16.052
Yeah, you never wanted
to be the cop.

01:11:16.230 --> 01:11:17.686
I do now.

01:11:17.857 --> 01:11:19.893
For all the wrong reasons.

01:11:20.067 --> 01:11:21.807
Yo, what the fuck is
that supposed to mean?

01:11:24.197 --> 01:11:26.438
I don't wanna do this anymore.

01:11:26.616 --> 01:11:29.198
What, you ain't down for us no more?

01:11:29.368 --> 01:11:31.780
No, I'm not down for this shit anymore.

01:11:31.954 --> 01:11:33.239
- Oh yeah? Yeah?
- Yeah, you heard me.

01:11:33.414 --> 01:11:34.824
- You got a problem with that?
- Shut up, man.

01:11:34.999 --> 01:11:36.580
Both of you just shut
the hell up, all right?

01:11:36.751 --> 01:11:38.742
Chill the hell out, man.

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:41.252
Look, if you want out,
A.D., you can go.

01:11:41.422 --> 01:11:43.504
It ain't gonna change nothing.

01:11:43.674 --> 01:11:45.414
Badges ain't change us.
We're still us.

01:11:45.593 --> 01:11:48.084
You know, badge or no badge,
this is bullshit.

01:11:49.847 --> 01:11:51.678
Just as bad as Sarcone is, Malo.

01:11:51.849 --> 01:11:54.932
And the crazy thing is you like it.

01:11:55.102 --> 01:11:58.594
And this asshole over here wants
to grow up to be just like you

01:11:58.773 --> 01:12:00.513
if you don't get us all killed first.

01:12:00.691 --> 01:12:02.647
That's how you feel?

01:12:04.111 --> 01:12:05.817
I'm done, man.

01:12:07.281 --> 01:12:09.863
- I'm out.
- Was it really that bad?

01:12:12.703 --> 01:12:14.694
You think I'd leave if it wasn't?

01:12:26.342 --> 01:12:28.003
Don't listen to that pussy.

01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:31.089
You got it all under control
like you always do. Right, my dude?

01:12:31.264 --> 01:12:33.095
Shut up, Lucas.

01:12:39.272 --> 01:12:41.934
You've been telling me what to do
since we was little kids.

01:12:43.442 --> 01:12:44.978
I'm tired of it.

01:12:46.612 --> 01:12:49.479
What do you think she'd do
if she knows you killed Angie?

01:12:49.657 --> 01:12:52.649
You think Cyn would forgive you
for killing her brother?

01:12:52.827 --> 01:12:54.442
And what about Sarcone?

01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:57.862
What do you think he'd do he knows
you're stabbing him in the back?

01:12:59.542 --> 01:13:02.033
Don't you play all high
and mighty with me, bitch.

01:13:03.337 --> 01:13:05.419
'Cause you can't fuck with me,

01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:08.627
but I can fuck with you though.

01:13:08.801 --> 01:13:10.541
You remember that.

01:13:24.609 --> 01:13:26.645
Gabriel.

01:13:26.819 --> 01:13:28.730
How does this happen?
Completely unacceptable.

01:13:28.905 --> 01:13:30.566
Yeah yeah, I know,
I know, I know.

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:33.106
- You need to fix this now.
- Yeah, don't worry. I got it.

01:13:33.284 --> 01:13:34.899
How could the racetrack get hit?

01:13:35.077 --> 01:13:36.613
- What am I paying you for?
- Yeah, I got it.

01:13:36.787 --> 01:13:38.493
- You need to make this right.
- I got it.

01:13:38.664 --> 01:13:41.622
- You have two days to find my money.
- Okay okay.

01:13:47.298 --> 01:13:49.835
It's Lureu.
At the beep, say it.

01:14:03.147 --> 01:14:06.639
- I'm out.
- Oh yeah.

01:14:10.237 --> 01:14:12.694
- Hey.
- Where the fuck are you?

01:14:12.865 --> 01:14:15.026
Something very messy just went down.

01:14:15.201 --> 01:14:16.486
You sound worried, Joe.

01:14:16.661 --> 01:14:20.074
- Have you seen your partner lately?
- No, why?

01:14:20.247 --> 01:14:22.033
I'm in a spot
where I can get touched real bad.

01:14:22.208 --> 01:14:24.164
An associate just got jacked
for nine digits

01:14:24.335 --> 01:14:26.576
and that just don't happen
without me knowing about it.

01:14:26.754 --> 01:14:28.494
I don't know what the fuck is going on.

01:14:28.673 --> 01:14:30.413
Lureu's not picking up his phone

01:14:30.591 --> 01:14:32.752
and I can't find him
and I don't know what to think now.

01:14:32.927 --> 01:14:35.088
Sounds like you know
who the rat is, Joe.

01:14:35.262 --> 01:14:37.719
- How much did he steal?
- I can't cover it.

01:14:40.476 --> 01:14:43.218
- And I didn't say it was Lureu.
- But you think it is.

01:14:43.396 --> 01:14:45.682
- Want me go find him?
- Nah.

01:14:45.856 --> 01:14:48.893
If he don't wanna be found, he's got a
million places to lay up and stay high.

01:14:49.068 --> 01:14:51.855
- That's what I'm worried about.
- Want me hit the streets,

01:14:52.029 --> 01:14:54.896
- make some things happen?
- No, what I want you to do

01:14:55.074 --> 01:14:56.814
is I want you to meet
my friend Gabriel Baez,

01:14:56.993 --> 01:14:58.483
and I want you to calm him down.

01:14:58.661 --> 01:15:00.117
Okay, whatever you want, Joe.

01:15:02.081 --> 01:15:03.617
Fuck Lureu.
I got you, right?

01:15:03.791 --> 01:15:06.874
That's right.
You can always trust me.

01:15:07.878 --> 01:15:09.493
Okay.

01:15:28.566 --> 01:15:31.808
My name's Jonas Maldonado, Malo.

01:15:31.986 --> 01:15:34.352
Are you wearing a wire,
Mr. Maldonado?

01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:38.068
- No sir.
- Joe speaks very highly of you.

01:15:38.242 --> 01:15:40.278
Thank you, sir.

01:15:40.453 --> 01:15:43.911
It is disrespectful of him
to send a messenger in his place.

01:15:44.915 --> 01:15:46.997
Don't you agree, Mr. Maldonado?

01:15:48.753 --> 01:15:50.289
Speak, messenger.

01:15:50.463 --> 01:15:53.250
You think Joe sent me here
to pacify you,

01:15:53.424 --> 01:15:55.085
but he sent me here to lie to you.

01:15:56.093 --> 01:15:58.004
Where is Joe, Mr. Maldonado?

01:15:58.179 --> 01:16:00.170
Somewhere counting your money.

01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:08.519
Please do choose
your next words very carefully.

01:16:08.689 --> 01:16:10.270
Explain.

01:16:10.441 --> 01:16:12.147
None of what
went down was my idea.

01:16:12.318 --> 01:16:14.525
Are you about to admit
to stealing from me?

01:16:14.695 --> 01:16:16.026
I was there, yes,

01:16:16.197 --> 01:16:18.028
but it's Sarcone that's screwing you.

01:16:18.199 --> 01:16:19.484
He's trying to use me to do it

01:16:19.658 --> 01:16:21.740
and I don't wanna be in the middle
when you screw him back.

01:16:21.911 --> 01:16:23.401
But you're still in the bed,

01:16:23.579 --> 01:16:26.571
aren't you, Mr. Maldonado?

01:16:26.749 --> 01:16:28.660
Now where is my property?

01:16:28.834 --> 01:16:31.450
Sarcone has it, but I can get it back.

01:16:31.629 --> 01:16:34.996
- All of it.
- Why do you betray your patrón?

01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:40.627
These are the transcripts
from the DEA's wiretaps

01:16:40.805 --> 01:16:42.466
inside Sarcone's bar.

01:16:43.516 --> 01:16:45.131
He's over a barrel.

01:16:45.309 --> 01:16:47.846
He'll give everyone up
to save his own ass.

01:16:49.313 --> 01:16:50.803
All they really want is you.

01:16:50.981 --> 01:16:52.687
Robbing you is just his way

01:16:52.858 --> 01:16:55.440
of fucking you a little deeper
before he hands you over.

01:16:57.071 --> 01:16:58.402
So are we in business?

01:16:58.572 --> 01:17:00.813
What do you want, Mr. Maldonado?

01:17:00.991 --> 01:17:02.731
I want Sarcone's seat at your table.

01:17:04.328 --> 01:17:05.613
First my property.

01:17:09.416 --> 01:17:12.249
Half the money
and the product is with Lureu.

01:17:12.419 --> 01:17:14.080
Here's an address, key to a car--

01:17:14.255 --> 01:17:15.620
half your stuff is in it.

01:17:15.798 --> 01:17:17.459
Sarcone has the other half.

01:17:17.633 --> 01:17:20.841
I'll bring him out in the open so
you can deal with him how you see fit.

01:17:21.846 --> 01:17:24.462
I'm really resourceful, Mr. Baez.

01:17:25.516 --> 01:17:27.507
You're dismissed.

01:17:40.406 --> 01:17:41.942
Stay close, man.

01:17:48.205 --> 01:17:49.991
- Motherfuckers!
- You stay down!

01:17:54.044 --> 01:17:55.580
You drive.

01:18:07.433 --> 01:18:09.014
- Joe.
- Did you find him?

01:18:09.185 --> 01:18:11.847
No, I ain't find him,
but I found half the money at his place.

01:18:12.021 --> 01:18:14.728
- It look like he did it.
- Ahh.

01:18:14.899 --> 01:18:17.060
- Baez is gonna be pissed.
- I know, I know,

01:18:17.234 --> 01:18:19.771
but relax, man.
Baez don't know who jacked him.

01:18:19.945 --> 01:18:21.981
He should be happy
you found half his stuff.

01:18:22.156 --> 01:18:23.987
Maybe ask for a finder's fee.

01:18:24.158 --> 01:18:26.865
- Remember who's doing who a favor.
- A'ight.

01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:35.995
- Hello, this is Jude.
- Hello.

01:18:36.170 --> 01:18:38.912
Agent Jude, I think all the pieces
are falling in place.

01:18:39.089 --> 01:18:40.829
I just need a few more things.

01:18:41.008 --> 01:18:44.375
You know, I understand you wanting
to avenge your father's death and all,

01:18:44.553 --> 01:18:47.260
but what happens after that, huh?

01:18:49.266 --> 01:18:52.099
I mean, you ever actually thought
about respecting the badge?

01:18:52.269 --> 01:18:55.761
Perhaps aiming some
of that angst in the right direction?

01:18:55.940 --> 01:18:58.556
No, I ain't thought about that lately.

01:19:01.654 --> 01:19:03.190
So what do you need?

01:19:38.315 --> 01:19:40.647
Kill me?
You wanna kill me?

01:19:40.818 --> 01:19:43.059
You ain't got the balls to face me

01:19:43.237 --> 01:19:45.853
man to man! Huh?

01:19:49.952 --> 01:19:51.692
Oh, so you're gonna take me out?

01:19:52.746 --> 01:19:54.236
It's like that?

01:19:54.415 --> 01:19:56.656
Well, come on then! Come on!

01:19:58.711 --> 01:20:00.702
Piece of shit.

01:21:00.564 --> 01:21:03.852
- Is that the rest of my property?
- It's right there, sir.

01:21:07.154 --> 01:21:09.520
Like you predicted, Joe did call--

01:21:10.657 --> 01:21:12.488
add insult to injury.

01:21:14.244 --> 01:21:16.451
You're clever, Mr. Maldonado.

01:21:17.915 --> 01:21:19.576
You satisfied?

01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:24.418
Remind me-- what is my incentive

01:21:24.588 --> 01:21:27.125
for not shooting you
or killing you right now?

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.676
I'm clever.
You just said it.

01:21:37.267 --> 01:21:40.885
Joe underestimated you.
I will not.

01:21:41.063 --> 01:21:43.395
I've proven my loyalty to you.

01:21:43.565 --> 01:21:45.146
Not yet,

01:21:45.317 --> 01:21:47.273
but soon you will.

01:21:48.946 --> 01:21:51.688
Oh shit.
What the fuck is going on here?

01:21:51.865 --> 01:21:54.857
Hup! Take it easy.

01:21:56.078 --> 01:21:57.943
What is this?

01:21:58.122 --> 01:22:00.408
It's a test.

01:22:07.965 --> 01:22:11.583
- Who's the girl?
- I know that your friend is a liability

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:15.844
that Joe tolerates just
to keep you close to him.

01:22:16.014 --> 01:22:17.845
I really don't know why.

01:22:18.016 --> 01:22:20.132
I don't deal with liabilities.

01:22:21.228 --> 01:22:22.968
Unfortunately,

01:22:23.147 --> 01:22:26.389
the girl was with your friend
when we picked him up.

01:22:27.568 --> 01:22:30.776
She's an innocent bystander.

01:22:34.575 --> 01:22:37.567
Now you're dealing with me,
Mr. Maldonado.

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:41.407
You're gonna shoot one of them

01:22:42.499 --> 01:22:44.205
or I'll kill them both.

01:22:46.587 --> 01:22:48.999
You choose, Mr. Maldonado.

01:23:34.218 --> 01:23:36.334
- Hey.
- All right, let's start it. Let's go.

01:23:36.512 --> 01:23:38.719
- Everybody in line.
- Nice.

01:23:38.889 --> 01:23:40.720
Here we go.

01:23:41.767 --> 01:23:44.304
Come on, you little sissies.
Let's go. Move it!

01:24:01.245 --> 01:24:02.860
What-- what's up, man?

01:24:03.038 --> 01:24:05.404
Guys, come on!
Let's move move!

01:24:05.582 --> 01:24:07.789
It's good what you're doing, man.

01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:10.121
Hut hut! Hey hey, hold on.

01:24:10.295 --> 01:24:12.206
You know, my TO was right.

01:24:13.382 --> 01:24:15.168
I've learned a lot about myself.

01:24:17.427 --> 01:24:19.509
You could too.

01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:22.922
32, grip the ball. Set. Hut hut!

01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:25.386
There you go. There you go.

01:24:25.561 --> 01:24:28.928
I gotta go back to the kids, man.

01:24:29.106 --> 01:24:30.812
You be good.

01:25:02.889 --> 01:25:04.629
You look like shit.

01:25:07.686 --> 01:25:09.301
Sarcone is in the car.

01:25:09.479 --> 01:25:11.344
Look sharp. This is it, folks.

01:25:11.523 --> 01:25:13.605
Still no word from Lureu?

01:25:21.450 --> 01:25:24.692
Yeah.
You know why I trust you, kid?

01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:27.907
- 'Cause you know I won't fuck you over?
- Yeah.

01:25:28.081 --> 01:25:29.821
When's the last time you seen Baez?

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:31.706
Not long enough.

01:25:31.877 --> 01:25:33.617
I gotta see that prick tonight.

01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:36.662
As long as that money
come through nice

01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:39.547
- twice a month, right?
- It takes a certain type of individual

01:25:39.718 --> 01:25:42.255
to do what we do, to have the balls
to be the type of men we are.

01:25:42.429 --> 01:25:44.215
You gotta want it-- all of it.

01:25:44.389 --> 01:25:46.380
Good guys, bad guys--
that's all bullshit

01:25:46.558 --> 01:25:50.221
when it comes down to it.
It's about money, fear and respect.

01:25:50.395 --> 01:25:52.602
Like you, I always wanted all three.

01:25:52.773 --> 01:25:56.186
Iike your father did when--
when we started out.

01:25:59.613 --> 01:26:01.899
Do not let them out of your sight.

01:26:23.679 --> 01:26:25.044
Copy that.

01:26:27.557 --> 01:26:29.673
Tell me the story
about that plane heist.

01:26:29.851 --> 01:26:32.718
- I love that story.
- What, how me and your dad started?

01:26:32.896 --> 01:26:35.137
- Attaboy.
- Me and your father used to pick up

01:26:35.315 --> 01:26:38.807
Baez's mules at JFK cargo
and escort 'em through the city.

01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:42.061
We'd babysit through
distribution, collection

01:26:42.239 --> 01:26:44.571
around the city,
then we'd escort 'em back to JFK.

01:26:44.741 --> 01:26:46.356
Easy-peasy, 1 0 Gs easy.

01:26:46.535 --> 01:26:49.777
- Nice.
- Yeah, 1 0 Gs

01:26:49.955 --> 01:26:52.116
before skimming off the top of cargo.

01:26:52.290 --> 01:26:55.327
That's how I built my empire,
stealing dope from that--

01:26:56.420 --> 01:26:57.830
you know, dope.

01:26:59.089 --> 01:27:01.922
- So when did it go bad?
- Between me and Baez?

01:27:02.092 --> 01:27:03.628
No, between you and my father.

01:27:14.479 --> 01:27:16.595
I told you everything
you need to know, kid.

01:27:17.607 --> 01:27:19.063
Tell me what you think I don't know.

01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:25.441
You know...

01:27:26.491 --> 01:27:28.231
when it came down to it,

01:27:28.410 --> 01:27:31.152
your father was afraid
to make the tough decisions,

01:27:31.329 --> 01:27:33.160
so he made the wrong ones.

01:27:33.331 --> 01:27:35.447
Shake the tree, Malo.
Come on.

01:27:35.625 --> 01:27:37.206
I've always done right by you, kid.

01:27:37.377 --> 01:27:39.868
- Like a father to me.
- Like a father.

01:27:42.090 --> 01:27:44.297
And I wouldn't offer you my hand

01:27:44.468 --> 01:27:46.083
if I thought you were gonna bite it.

01:27:48.054 --> 01:27:49.965
I just wanna know the truth.

01:27:50.140 --> 01:27:52.096
Attaboy.

01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:56.976
I never ever,

01:27:57.147 --> 01:28:00.059
not for one instant, thought your father
would or could rat us out,

01:28:00.233 --> 01:28:03.145
but the facts are what they are.
He made a deal with an ADA.

01:28:04.613 --> 01:28:07.480
We're talking serious jail time
for everybody, including me.

01:28:07.657 --> 01:28:10.023
Everybody was gonna be shamed
and disgraced in the papers,

01:28:10.202 --> 01:28:11.282
the whole nine yards.

01:28:11.453 --> 01:28:14.445
And the word came down
on Monday morning. It had to get done.

01:28:15.874 --> 01:28:17.284
Why you?

01:28:18.502 --> 01:28:20.959
Because l-- I was his partner.

01:28:21.129 --> 01:28:22.994
It was a test of my loyalty.

01:28:23.173 --> 01:28:24.754
Was it them or was it him?

01:28:24.925 --> 01:28:26.756
What would you do?

01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:30.801
It was a Wednesday.

01:28:31.890 --> 01:28:33.926
We followed him
to Roosevelt lsland and--

01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:35.840
All units, stand ready.

01:28:36.019 --> 01:28:40.262
And he was pulled over
by a patrol car, of all things.

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:43.102
We waited for them to leave
and then we went over.

01:28:44.277 --> 01:28:45.983
I made him get out. I...

01:28:55.330 --> 01:28:57.161
Your father was a--

01:29:00.001 --> 01:29:01.957
your father was a...

01:29:03.004 --> 01:29:04.335
he was a rat.

01:29:05.841 --> 01:29:07.797
Take him
when he exits the car.

01:29:17.477 --> 01:29:19.092
Would you do it again?

01:29:20.272 --> 01:29:23.514
Your father was afraid
to make the tough decisions.

01:29:23.692 --> 01:29:27.935
Men like us are built to make
those kinds of decisions.

01:29:28.113 --> 01:29:30.354
That's who we are.
Can you do that?

01:29:30.532 --> 01:29:32.739
Can you make those tough decisions?

01:29:36.413 --> 01:29:37.778
I already have.

01:29:47.090 --> 01:29:48.421
Take him. Go. Go go!

01:29:49.551 --> 01:29:53.009
I'm gonna go.
Get your fucking hands off me.

01:30:00.687 --> 01:30:02.928
Man down.
Where'd that shot come from?

01:30:04.107 --> 01:30:06.314
Check the rooftops now!

01:30:07.319 --> 01:30:08.934
Where'd that shot come from?

01:30:09.112 --> 01:30:11.444
It's gotta be Baez! God damn it!

01:30:11.615 --> 01:30:13.276
Everybody out there right now!

01:30:13.450 --> 01:30:16.032
Get up on those rooftops, all units!

01:30:16.202 --> 01:30:18.238
Shut down everything!
I don't want anybody

01:30:18.413 --> 01:30:20.779
getting out of this area,
not in a five-block radius!

01:30:20.957 --> 01:30:23.289
- I want everybody to move now!
- Fall back. I'm going in.

01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:25.075
What the hell happened?

01:30:26.922 --> 01:30:29.629
I need a car on that end.
I need a car on this end.

01:30:43.313 --> 01:30:45.599
Thanks for not
giving up on me, Cyn.

01:30:55.825 --> 01:30:58.908
- You always get what you want?
- I did my part.

01:30:59.079 --> 01:31:01.786
Oh, I know what you did
and I know what you're planning.

01:31:02.874 --> 01:31:04.284
With my help, you got Baez

01:31:04.459 --> 01:31:06.165
to clear Sarcone out of the picture

01:31:06.336 --> 01:31:08.998
and now you get to take
Sarcone's place at Baez's table.

01:31:09.172 --> 01:31:10.787
That's very clever.

01:31:10.966 --> 01:31:12.581
Why don't you try

01:31:12.759 --> 01:31:15.375
working for the good guys for a change?

01:31:15.553 --> 01:31:17.384
I know you got it in you.

01:31:18.848 --> 01:31:20.554
You think you know me.

01:31:20.725 --> 01:31:23.091
I'm not a good guy.

01:31:25.855 --> 01:31:28.141
All right, part-time then.

01:31:28.316 --> 01:31:30.272
Part-time good guy, like a--

01:31:31.736 --> 01:31:33.192
a freelancer.

01:31:33.363 --> 01:31:34.728
Freelancer, huh?

01:31:37.075 --> 01:31:39.407
If you're gonna wear the badge,

01:31:39.577 --> 01:31:41.943
take the responsibility
that goes with it, huh?

01:31:44.332 --> 01:31:47.324
Who knows? You might even find
a little self-respect too.

01:31:50.046 --> 01:31:52.253
Agent Jude,
this is an old friend of mine.

01:31:52.424 --> 01:31:54.710
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:31:54.884 --> 01:31:56.590
Agent Jude works for the DEA.

01:31:57.804 --> 01:31:58.964
He's my new boss.

01:32:00.932 --> 01:32:03.139
- Nice to have met you.
- Likewise.

01:32:07.897 --> 01:32:09.387
I'll be going undercover.

01:32:10.525 --> 01:32:12.436
What does that mean for us?

01:32:12.610 --> 01:32:14.225
Look...

01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:17.316
this is our time, Cyn.

01:32:18.616 --> 01:32:20.106
Trust me.

01:32:24.956 --> 01:32:26.446
Jonas.

01:32:31.254 --> 01:32:32.915
I love you, Cyn.

01:32:48.938 --> 01:32:51.771
Yeah!

01:32:53.610 --> 01:32:54.645
Yeah!

01:32:59.157 --> 01:33:01.398
- Decoy.
- Unh, shotgun flow

01:33:01.576 --> 01:33:03.737
Hit 'em with the sawed-off,
killing all these haters

01:33:03.912 --> 01:33:05.652
Make 'em all get hauled off

01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:08.492
Bitch, look at me,
act like you don't see a king

01:33:08.666 --> 01:33:11.248
Make you kneel down and kiss
the motherfucking ring
