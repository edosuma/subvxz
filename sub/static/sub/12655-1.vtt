 you can always count on me 

00:23.157 --> 00:25.691
 me and you 

00:25.693 --> 00:27.760
 are stuck like glue 

00:27.762 --> 00:31.897
 to never come apart 

00:31.899 --> 00:33.599
 you and me 

00:33.601 --> 00:35.934
 couldn't hurt a flea 

00:35.936 --> 00:40.172
 we're the same right
down to the heart 

00:40.174 --> 00:42.174
 togetherness 

00:42.176 --> 00:44.443
 it's like nothing 

00:44.445 --> 00:48.447
 and it's something
that's hard to find 

00:48.449 --> 00:50.382
 the two of us 

00:50.384 --> 00:52.684
 are so similar 

00:52.686 --> 00:56.722
 you know that I can
read your mind 

00:56.724 --> 01:00.759
 when the rain comes
falling down 

01:00.761 --> 01:05.030
 the sun will come
right back around 

01:05.032 --> 01:06.632

"dog psychic stuns experts"

01:16.777 --> 01:18.877
Don't you worry, boy.

01:18.879 --> 01:20.679
Everything's gonna be all right.

01:22.283 --> 01:25.117
Looks like he's the
real thing, boy.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.888
Mr. Morgan is a
dog therapist.

01:29.890 --> 01:32.891
He's been gifted with a
psychic connection to
canines.

01:32.893 --> 01:34.827
So he can actually
read their thoughts

01:34.829 --> 01:36.628
And communicate with them.

01:36.630 --> 01:39.064
He'll sit your dog down
for a consultation

01:39.066 --> 01:40.632
And see if he can't
get the heart

01:40.634 --> 01:42.134
Of what's really bothering him.

01:42.136 --> 01:43.969
Is this for real or what?

01:43.971 --> 01:46.605
Oh, yes. Mr. Morgan has
been doing this for years.

01:46.607 --> 01:49.007
He's a very talented and
sensitive therapist.

02:02.756 --> 02:05.591
Dog therapist.
This is bernice.

02:05.593 --> 02:08.127
Dog therapist... for
crying out loud.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.627
Why do I listen to you?

02:09.630 --> 02:13.999
Oh, really? Well, I put
that check in the mail
last week.

02:14.001 --> 02:17.603
Nothing in the envelope?
The check must've fallen out.

02:17.605 --> 02:19.471
There's nothing
going on in there.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.440
Fifty bucks down the drain.

02:21.442 --> 02:24.977
Well, maybe he communicates with
his clients on a higher level.

02:24.979 --> 02:26.311
That does it. I'm
going in there.

02:26.313 --> 02:27.846
You can't go in there!

02:29.483 --> 02:31.717
What did I tell you?

02:31.719 --> 02:33.385
He's nothing but a big phony.

02:33.387 --> 02:37.022
Well, ah, we were making
some real progress.

02:37.024 --> 02:39.158
Progress? You were sleeping!

02:39.160 --> 02:42.528
Well, that's how it may
appear to the untrained eye.

02:42.530 --> 02:44.730
Let's see what it looks
like with a black eye.

02:44.732 --> 02:47.032
You know, I'm sensing a
lot of hostility here.

02:47.034 --> 02:48.667
And that could really
cause some serious

02:48.669 --> 02:50.302
Psychological damage to bosco.

02:50.304 --> 02:51.970
From which he may never recover.

02:51.972 --> 02:53.238
And you're gonna have
to live with that,

02:53.240 --> 02:55.507
Fine. Live with this...

02:55.509 --> 02:57.809
I happen to be a personal
friend of the mayor,

02:57.811 --> 02:59.645
And I'm gonna have this
place closed down

02:59.647 --> 03:02.247
Quicker than you can say
"cease and desist."

03:02.249 --> 03:03.849
Get the dog, emily.

03:03.851 --> 03:06.652
Come on, bosco. Come on.

03:10.391 --> 03:13.058
Oh, sure. Like he really
knows the mayor.

03:13.060 --> 03:15.494
This is it! I've
just had it, jack.

03:15.496 --> 03:17.262
It's too stressful!

03:17.264 --> 03:19.531
Besides, I've already
got a line on a job

03:19.533 --> 03:20.933
With more career potential.

03:20.935 --> 03:22.267
What kind of job?

03:22.269 --> 03:24.236
Drive-in hostess at
the chicken mart.

03:24.238 --> 03:26.905
You sure I can't talk
you out of leaving?

03:26.907 --> 03:28.373
Positive.

03:28.375 --> 03:29.775
What if I give you a raise?

03:29.777 --> 03:32.177
I'd settle for what you
already owe me, jack.

03:32.179 --> 03:34.746
I'm sure gonna miss
you, bernice.

03:36.584 --> 03:38.016
A customer!

03:38.018 --> 03:40.118
Stop packing. Put it away.

03:42.122 --> 03:43.355
Jack morgan?

03:43.357 --> 03:44.357
At your service.

03:44.358 --> 03:46.792
I'm clyde windsor.

03:46.794 --> 03:48.126
This is calvin.

03:48.128 --> 03:49.194
Hello.

03:49.196 --> 03:52.598
And this unhappy
fellow is lucky.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.467
He's been so upset and
agitated lately.

03:55.469 --> 03:58.337
I'm very concerned.

03:59.440 --> 04:00.939
Yes, yes, I can see.

04:00.941 --> 04:02.307
He needs immediate attention.

04:03.277 --> 04:04.243
Hmmm.

04:04.245 --> 04:06.144
Could be a chewing disorder.

04:06.146 --> 04:08.280
Or tail anxiety.

04:08.282 --> 04:09.948
Or both.

04:13.454 --> 04:16.321
Bernice, when is my
next open appointment?

04:19.293 --> 04:21.726
You're clear till
next thanksgiving.

04:21.728 --> 04:23.128
Shhh.

04:23.130 --> 04:25.564
Well, looks like we
have a cancellation.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.165
We can get started right away.

04:28.402 --> 04:30.502
Please, make
yourselves comfortable.

04:30.504 --> 04:32.571
Bernice, the gentlemen
might like a cup of
coffee.

04:32.573 --> 04:33.772
So would I.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.307
It's across the
street at the diner.

04:36.810 --> 04:39.611
Ha ha, she's great.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.780
Ok. Well, come on, lucky.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.815
This won't take long.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.350
Come on. This
won't hurt a bit.

04:45.352 --> 04:46.352
That's it, boy.
Go ahead.

04:48.322 --> 04:50.389
Here we go. Have a seat.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.532
Who am I kidding?

05:00.534 --> 05:03.869
Your head's as empty as
a clear sky, isn't it?

05:03.871 --> 05:06.271
Even if I could read your mind,

05:06.273 --> 05:08.507
All you'd be thinking
about is chasing squirrels

05:08.509 --> 05:09.669
And drinking out of a toilet.

05:11.812 --> 05:15.347
Believe it or not,
there was a time

05:15.349 --> 05:17.649
When I could actually do this.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.651
For real.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.953
I was just a kid.

05:21.955 --> 05:23.515
Maybe it was some kind
of genetic thing.

05:25.059 --> 05:27.359
Well, whatever it was

05:27.361 --> 05:29.094
It just faded away.

05:36.470 --> 05:39.071
Man, what was that?

05:39.073 --> 05:42.040
I gotta get out of this
office more often.

05:43.977 --> 05:45.811
I've got to get some fresh air.

05:49.149 --> 05:51.550
What the heck is going on?

05:56.056 --> 05:58.323
Wait a second...

05:58.325 --> 06:00.726
What are you looking at?

06:04.331 --> 06:05.831
What are you up to?

06:10.871 --> 06:13.105
All right, that's it.

06:13.107 --> 06:14.673
This session is officially over.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.548
Oh, done already?

06:23.550 --> 06:25.517
Yes. I'm having trouble
getting through to him.

06:25.519 --> 06:27.552
I'm sorry. It's just
not gonna work out.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.121
Are you sure?

06:29.123 --> 06:30.756
I'm positive.

06:30.758 --> 06:32.357
Maybe you should just see
another dog therapist.

06:32.359 --> 06:34.593
Or a veterinarian.
Anybody but me.

06:34.595 --> 06:36.128
Is lucky all right?

06:36.130 --> 06:37.095
I don't know.

06:37.097 --> 06:38.397
Is he sick?

06:38.399 --> 06:39.698
I don't...

06:42.770 --> 06:44.436
He's worried about you.

06:44.438 --> 06:46.438
Me?

06:46.440 --> 06:49.941
He's sensing some hostility...

06:49.943 --> 06:53.545
From two... No,
three people...

06:53.547 --> 06:55.113
In your own home.

06:55.115 --> 06:57.616
How did you know about that?

07:02.823 --> 07:05.490
Ah, to be honest with you,

07:05.492 --> 07:06.958
I have no idea.

07:08.896 --> 07:10.395
It was probably just
a lucky guess.

07:10.397 --> 07:12.631
Listen. You better leave.

07:12.633 --> 07:17.569
At least, let me pay you
for your information.

07:17.571 --> 07:18.804
Oh, no, no.
No, no, no.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.739
I cut the session short.

07:20.741 --> 07:21.473
I'm not gonna charge
you a thing.

07:21.475 --> 07:23.475
No, no. I insist.

07:23.477 --> 07:26.611
Now I understand what's
been bothering lucky.

07:26.613 --> 07:30.315
Well, I'm glad I could help.

07:30.317 --> 07:34.186
You have a remarkable
gift, young man.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.192
Come on.

07:51.839 --> 07:54.606
A gift? It's more
like a curse.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.343
What happened in there?

07:58.345 --> 07:59.611
It's the dog.

08:00.681 --> 08:02.814
What, windsor's?

08:02.816 --> 08:05.183
Yeah, I just...

08:05.185 --> 08:07.619
I got a really
weird vibe off him.

08:07.621 --> 08:10.021
He kind of spooked me.

08:10.023 --> 08:11.523
What are you talking about?

08:11.525 --> 08:15.794
After all these years,
he's the only one that I
almost...

08:15.796 --> 08:17.529
He just rattled me.

08:17.531 --> 08:20.298
If you're talking about
you know what,

08:20.300 --> 08:22.133
You haven't had that
since you were 14.

08:27.241 --> 08:29.307
Yeah?

08:30.477 --> 08:33.311
Oh, I see.

08:33.313 --> 08:35.547
Jack, it's the mayor's office.

08:43.756 --> 08:47.893
Well, I happen to be a
respected canine therapist.

08:48.729 --> 08:50.228
Why are you laughing?

08:50.230 --> 08:54.199
Listen. I provide a valuable
service to the community.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.234
Hello?

08:59.273 --> 09:01.072
Well, fine.

09:01.074 --> 09:04.376
Pick my bones while I'm
down, you vultures.

09:04.378 --> 09:06.545
I can't believe this.

09:06.547 --> 09:08.346
This is totally unfair.

09:08.348 --> 09:10.849
Uh, mr. Morgan?

09:10.851 --> 09:13.251
Remember me, calvin bridges?

09:13.253 --> 09:16.288
Yes, yes. You
work for, uh...

09:16.290 --> 09:17.455
Mr. Windsor.

09:17.457 --> 09:18.590
Right.

09:18.592 --> 09:21.426
I'm sorry. Did I
come at a bad time?

09:21.428 --> 09:25.463
Oh, no. I'm just,
uh, remodeling.

09:25.465 --> 09:26.965
Uh-huh.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.967
What brings you
here, mr. Bridges?

09:28.969 --> 09:30.468
Bad news, I'm afraid.

09:30.470 --> 09:32.437
Mr. Windsor passed
away last week.

09:32.439 --> 09:34.439
Oh, I'm very sorry.

09:34.441 --> 09:36.942
He was such a nice old guy.

09:36.944 --> 09:39.210
Yes, he was.

09:39.212 --> 09:41.279
Now you're needed at the estate.

09:41.281 --> 09:42.614
Why?

09:42.616 --> 09:43.949
Something to do with lucky.

09:43.951 --> 09:45.317
No, thanks.

09:45.319 --> 09:48.219
I really think you
should reconsider.

09:48.221 --> 09:50.455
I told you I want
nothing to do with
that dog.

09:50.457 --> 09:51.923
This could be very much
worth your while.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.558
Come on. Let me
drive you over.

09:53.560 --> 09:55.060
No.

09:55.062 --> 09:58.630
Why, you got something
better to do?

09:58.632 --> 10:00.899
Well...

10:04.905 --> 10:06.805
I think we're
ready to begin
the proceeding.

10:06.807 --> 10:10.008
First, let me express my
heart-felt condolences

10:10.010 --> 10:11.743
On the death of your
uncle clyde windsor.

10:11.745 --> 10:12.944
Thank you, my dear.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.113
It has indeed been
very devastating.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.348
It's been so difficult.

10:16.350 --> 10:18.249
Please proceed.

10:18.251 --> 10:19.251
Fine.

10:20.654 --> 10:23.088
"I, clyde windsor, being
of sound mind and body

10:23.090 --> 10:24.589
Yeah, right.

10:24.591 --> 10:26.691
"do hereby bequeath my
worldly possessions

10:26.693 --> 10:28.193
"to my only living
heirs as follows:

10:28.195 --> 10:29.427
Yes!

10:29.429 --> 10:30.629
"to my nephew ruben,

10:30.631 --> 10:33.098
"who never showed an
interest in anything,

10:33.100 --> 10:34.599
"other than his own comfort,

10:34.601 --> 10:37.435
I leave my favorite
easy chair."

10:37.437 --> 10:39.337
I always liked that chair.

10:39.339 --> 10:40.972
You moron,

10:40.974 --> 10:42.907
He's cut you out of his will.

10:45.379 --> 10:46.978
Who's next?

10:46.980 --> 10:48.513
"to my niece margaret,

10:48.515 --> 10:51.483
"whose greed is rivaled
only by her vanity,

10:51.485 --> 10:54.619
I leave one
full-length mirror."

10:54.621 --> 10:55.787
And...?

10:55.789 --> 10:57.188
I'm afraid that's it.

10:57.190 --> 10:59.624
It's mine! It's mine!

10:59.626 --> 11:01.059
What?!

11:01.061 --> 11:02.961
Thank you, uncle. Thank you.

11:02.963 --> 11:05.397
How dare he?

11:05.399 --> 11:07.499
"and to my sniveling
nephew lyle,

11:07.501 --> 11:10.301
"who has always been a
big numskull,

11:10.303 --> 11:12.937
I leave nothing."

11:15.475 --> 11:16.808
What?

11:16.810 --> 11:19.477
"that's right, lyle.
Absolutely nothing."

11:19.479 --> 11:21.546
Oh, that's what it says.

11:21.548 --> 11:24.315
I think that just
about covers it.

11:24.317 --> 11:26.885
Wait a minute. Who
gets the money?

11:26.887 --> 11:28.586
The 64 million dollars?

11:28.588 --> 11:31.322
The 64 million dollars has
been placed in a trust fund.

11:31.324 --> 11:32.991
But who gets the money?

11:34.227 --> 11:36.861
Mr. Bridges?
Uh, mr. Bridges,

11:36.863 --> 11:38.096
If it's not a house call

11:38.098 --> 11:39.230
Then why are we going to
the windsor estate?

11:39.232 --> 11:41.266
I told you I'm a very busy man.

11:41.268 --> 11:42.500
I'm practically a doctor.

11:42.502 --> 11:44.502
You're meeting with mr.
Windsor's attorney.

11:44.504 --> 11:45.870
His attorney?

11:45.872 --> 11:47.605
Here we are.

11:49.776 --> 11:53.378
Wow. This is the place?

11:53.380 --> 11:55.180
I've seen smaller museums.

12:12.132 --> 12:14.699
That's ridiculous!
We live here!

12:14.701 --> 12:16.935
What are we supposed to do?

12:16.937 --> 12:18.536
Is that him?

12:27.714 --> 12:29.114
Hi.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.617
I'm jack morgan,
the dog therapist.

12:32.619 --> 12:34.619
I'll kill you!

12:41.228 --> 12:43.394
Stop it! You'll kill him!

12:46.666 --> 12:48.366
Get her off of me!

12:53.807 --> 12:55.373
Wait, my foot!

13:06.653 --> 13:08.686
I'll be back!

13:11.424 --> 13:12.757
Are you ok?

13:12.759 --> 13:15.593
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

13:15.595 --> 13:17.529
I'm jack morgan.

13:17.531 --> 13:19.631
I'm here to see mr.
Windsor's attorney.

13:19.633 --> 13:21.533
That's me. Allison kent.

13:21.535 --> 13:23.468
You're the attorney?

13:23.470 --> 13:26.037
Yes. You seemed
surprised.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.373
Uh, well, I am.

13:28.375 --> 13:30.241
I mean I was.

13:34.881 --> 13:36.881
Are you ok?

13:36.883 --> 13:39.651
Yeah. Yeah, great.

13:39.653 --> 13:43.288
Good. We have some
business to discuss.

13:43.290 --> 13:45.023
We do?

13:49.963 --> 13:52.130
Nice place.

13:52.132 --> 13:53.965
Perhaps you'd like to
take a look around.

13:53.967 --> 13:56.067
Yeah. Sure.

13:56.069 --> 14:00.171
I think I should tell
you to prepare yourself.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.706
The situation that we're in here

14:01.708 --> 14:03.908
Is a bit unusual.

14:03.910 --> 14:08.213
In fact, I think it's
safe to say it's the
first of its kind.

14:08.215 --> 14:09.881
When you met mr. Windsor,

14:09.883 --> 14:13.384
I'm sure you noticed he was
a very unique individual.

14:13.386 --> 14:17.255
During his lifetime he
amassed a fortune of 64
million dollars.

14:17.257 --> 14:21.025
Well, that definitely
qualifies as amassing.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.727
You just met his
only living heirs,

14:22.729 --> 14:25.029
Who could best be
described as...

14:25.031 --> 14:27.398
Pond scum?

14:27.400 --> 14:31.369
Let's just say mr. Windsor
thought they were undeserving.

14:31.371 --> 14:34.873
So, that's why mr
windsor decided to
leave his entire estate

14:34.875 --> 14:38.910
To the only one he knew
possessed enough heart
and spirit

14:38.912 --> 14:40.378
To enjoy the money properly.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.747
His dog.

14:44.017 --> 14:45.416
Lucky.

14:45.418 --> 14:46.951
You're joking, right?

14:46.953 --> 14:48.620
No, I'm not.

14:48.622 --> 14:51.956
Wait a minute. How does a
dog inherit money?

14:51.958 --> 14:53.791
Well, the entire
64 million dollars

14:53.793 --> 14:55.526
Has been placed in a trust,

14:55.528 --> 14:57.795
And you have been named trustee.

14:57.797 --> 14:59.964
Lucky's permanently translator.

14:59.966 --> 15:02.200
His legal voice in all matters

15:02.202 --> 15:03.768
Regarding his whims and whishes

15:03.770 --> 15:05.069
For spending the fortune.

15:05.071 --> 15:07.238
The dog will be in
control of the assets,

15:07.240 --> 15:09.774
And you will be working for him.

15:09.776 --> 15:11.109
Me?

15:11.111 --> 15:13.878
Apparently, mr. Windsor was
very impressed with you.

15:15.715 --> 15:16.948
Really?

15:19.419 --> 15:21.619
Wait a minute.

15:21.621 --> 15:23.454
Let's get this straight.

15:23.456 --> 15:28.726
The dog and I have control
of all the money?

15:28.728 --> 15:30.662
That's right.

15:30.664 --> 15:32.997
And all the property,
including this mansion.

15:32.999 --> 15:35.333
If you choose to become trustee.

15:35.335 --> 15:38.403
Of course, it does require
some duties on your part.

15:38.405 --> 15:41.673
Oh. Duties?

15:41.675 --> 15:43.608
You'd have to live here.

15:43.610 --> 15:46.010
Oh, gee.

15:46.012 --> 15:48.479
And you'll have a
full-time staff

15:48.481 --> 15:51.482
Oh, a staff? I like
the sound of that.

15:51.484 --> 15:54.118
Are you sure this whole
thing is legal?

15:54.120 --> 15:55.787
Ironclad.

15:55.789 --> 15:59.490
Unless, of course, the
heirs can prove you're
mentally incompetent.

15:59.492 --> 16:02.193
Aw, well, no problem there.

16:02.195 --> 16:04.128
I mean, I am sharp as a tack.

16:13.940 --> 16:14.806
Mr. Morgan?

16:14.808 --> 16:16.040
Huh?

16:17.978 --> 16:19.844
So, is there anything else?

16:19.846 --> 16:22.180
Well, there is the
matter of money.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.482
Here's some credit
cards and cash

16:24.484 --> 16:26.451
To tide you over
until we set up
your bank account.

16:27.954 --> 16:29.287
Oh, excellent.

16:29.289 --> 16:32.924
It's been very...
Interesting.

16:34.627 --> 16:37.528
I think that takes care
of things for now.

16:37.530 --> 16:39.664
Yeah, well, drop by anytime.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.165
I'll see you later.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.633
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

16:52.712 --> 16:55.713
It's all mine.

16:55.715 --> 16:57.615
This whole castle is mine!

16:59.986 --> 17:02.520
I am master of the manor.

17:02.522 --> 17:06.391
I'm lord of the castle.

17:07.594 --> 17:09.861
I'm lord of the flies.

17:09.863 --> 17:12.262
Lord of the dance!

17:13.733 --> 17:15.165
I'm rich! I'm rich!

17:15.167 --> 17:16.701
I'm really, really rich!

17:16.703 --> 17:19.569
I'm rich! I'm rich!

17:19.571 --> 17:21.271
I'm really, really rich!

17:21.273 --> 17:23.273
I'm rich! I'm rich!

17:23.276 --> 17:25.143
I'm on top of the world!

17:27.513 --> 17:31.783
Uh... What can I say?
I've never been rich before.

17:31.785 --> 17:33.951
And it looks like
I'm your new driver.

17:33.953 --> 17:35.753
Great.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.455
I live upstairs in
the west wing.

17:37.457 --> 17:40.224
I'll be more than happy to
help you find your bedroom.

17:40.226 --> 17:43.928
Sure. I've never lived in a
place where I needed a tour
guide before.

17:45.465 --> 17:47.932
Oh, man, have I got a
weird taste in my mouth.

17:47.934 --> 17:49.200
You got a mint?

17:49.202 --> 17:50.101
No.

17:50.103 --> 17:51.602
It taste like...

17:51.604 --> 17:54.272
It taste like shoe leather.

17:54.274 --> 17:56.207
Are you all right, chief?

17:56.209 --> 17:59.277
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

17:59.279 --> 18:00.778
Ok. Follow me.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.547
Ok.

18:18.932 --> 18:21.299
The old man knew exactly
what he was doing.

18:21.301 --> 18:23.634
He was trying to teach
us some stupid lesson

18:23.636 --> 18:25.503
About the real world
or something.

18:25.505 --> 18:28.606
All I want to know is, how
do we get our money back?

18:28.608 --> 18:30.074
According to the will,

18:30.076 --> 18:31.976
The only way to
dissolve the trust

18:31.978 --> 18:34.912
Is to prove that the
trustee, mr. Jack morgan,

18:34.914 --> 18:37.582
Is mentally incompetent.

18:37.584 --> 18:39.951
He claims to be a dog psychic.

18:39.953 --> 18:41.285
What more proof do you need?

18:41.287 --> 18:42.120
Can you do it?

18:42.122 --> 18:45.256
Of course. Relax.

18:45.258 --> 18:47.792
If it takes me more than
a week I'll retire.

18:47.794 --> 18:51.162
But it's going to cost you.

18:51.164 --> 18:52.463
How much?

18:52.465 --> 18:54.699
Thirty percent.

18:54.701 --> 18:56.167
What? What?

18:56.169 --> 18:59.137
I think he said thirty percent.

18:59.139 --> 19:02.874
That's thirty percent
of our money.

19:02.876 --> 19:05.977
Your money currently
belongs to a dog.

19:05.979 --> 19:07.678
Ooh!

19:07.680 --> 19:11.182
Thirty percent of
squat is still squat.

19:11.184 --> 19:12.683
Do you want your
house back or not?

19:12.685 --> 19:14.652
I cost because I'm the
best in the business.

19:14.654 --> 19:17.288
I have you back in your
mansion, on your patio,

19:17.290 --> 19:20.958
With that dog on a barbecue
spit, in a couple of weeks.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.027
But thirty percent is
what it will cost.

19:25.064 --> 19:26.531
Take it or leave it.

19:27.800 --> 19:31.903
Well, what do we do for
money in the meantime?

19:31.905 --> 19:34.071
You could always take a job.

19:35.875 --> 19:39.744
All right, cut back on
your spending.

19:39.746 --> 19:41.879
Cut back?

19:41.881 --> 19:43.548
How am I supposed to live?

19:43.550 --> 19:46.250
I used an imported shampoo.

19:47.887 --> 19:51.155
Well, you could wear that
hat for a week.

19:51.157 --> 19:54.525
No, no, no, no.
We need a court order

19:54.527 --> 19:56.260
To be able to get
back into the house,

19:56.262 --> 19:58.429
To be able to get our
cars, our belongings...

19:58.431 --> 20:01.098
Negative. I don't want
you going back there

20:01.100 --> 20:02.600
Until after the trial.

20:02.602 --> 20:04.602
We're going for emotion here.

20:04.604 --> 20:05.903
I want to be able to
tell the jury

20:05.905 --> 20:08.272
That you were too
traumatized to go back.

20:08.274 --> 20:12.009
Don't worry. You'll be back
in your rooms in no time.

20:12.011 --> 20:14.178
This is an outrage.

20:14.180 --> 20:17.048
We have no credit
cards, no cars.

20:17.050 --> 20:19.116
I can't even imagine what
kind of room we could rent

20:19.118 --> 20:20.785
For the amount of
cash we have on us.

20:20.787 --> 20:22.286
What are we gonna do?

20:22.288 --> 20:24.555
Shhh, shhh, shhh.

20:24.557 --> 20:28.859
We'll consider the
offer, mr. Phister.

20:28.861 --> 20:30.261
Thank you.

20:30.263 --> 20:31.696
Come on. Let's go.

20:37.103 --> 20:40.938
I can't stand the thought of
that little creep in home.

20:40.940 --> 20:43.474
Heaven only knows what he's
doing at this very moment.

20:55.788 --> 20:59.824
It's good! Jack morgan
wins it again!

21:04.397 --> 21:06.964
Oh, no. Where's the ball?

21:06.966 --> 21:08.799
Where's the ball?

21:08.801 --> 21:10.701
I'm going in.

21:16.276 --> 21:20.678
Mr. Morgan, it's
the housekeepers.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.913
Would you like some dinner?

21:40.166 --> 21:41.666
Ooh!

21:43.336 --> 21:46.270
Wait. Don't be
afraid. I live here.

21:48.841 --> 21:50.841
Miss?

21:52.645 --> 21:54.612
Hello.

22:02.622 --> 22:04.622
Look at these sheets!

22:04.624 --> 22:05.790
At least, they're clean.

22:05.792 --> 22:07.291
But they're cotton!

22:07.293 --> 22:10.861
This skin has never
slept on anything less
than 100% silk.

22:10.863 --> 22:14.765
And I'm certainly not about
to start rubbing elbows with
mattress buttons now.

22:18.004 --> 22:19.737
This is unbearable.

22:19.739 --> 22:22.039
This is completely unacceptable!

22:22.041 --> 22:27.211
How much longer can we be
expected to endure this?

22:27.213 --> 22:30.381
I suggest we take
matters into our own
hands.

22:30.383 --> 22:33.984
Tell me. What do you
have in mind?

22:33.986 --> 22:37.688
Why pay that greedy
attorney millions of
dollars

22:37.690 --> 22:39.924
When we can handle the
problem ourselves?

22:39.926 --> 22:41.659
Yes? Yes?

22:41.661 --> 22:43.761
If lucky becomes unlucky

22:43.763 --> 22:46.230
The money reverts to us.

22:46.232 --> 22:48.432
You mean all we have to do

22:48.434 --> 22:50.801
Is change the dog's name?

22:52.572 --> 22:57.074
No. If lucky has
an accident...

22:57.076 --> 23:00.277
We get all of it back.

23:00.279 --> 23:02.346
Oh.

23:03.916 --> 23:05.950
It's too risky.

23:05.952 --> 23:07.918
Before we go that far,

23:07.920 --> 23:11.021
Let's get the goods on
that phony mutt lover.

23:11.023 --> 23:13.624
Let's not forget
we're down to our
last quarter.

23:13.626 --> 23:16.627
Can I use it for the
vibrating bed?

23:16.629 --> 23:18.496
Please?

23:31.244 --> 23:32.943
I know it's strange

23:32.945 --> 23:34.945
But mr. Windsor
was convinced

23:34.947 --> 23:37.982
I'd know exactly how lucky
wants the money spent.

23:39.385 --> 23:42.119
I'm neat and I'm tidy,

23:42.121 --> 23:44.455
I eat the normal stuff at
the normal times.

23:44.457 --> 23:46.223
Nothing fancy about me.

23:46.225 --> 23:49.226
I think you'll find
I'm just a normal...

23:50.129 --> 23:51.129
What?

23:51.130 --> 23:52.630
What?

23:52.632 --> 23:54.298
What did you say?

23:54.300 --> 23:56.600
I beg your pardon?

23:56.602 --> 23:58.636
You said something
about going outside.

23:58.638 --> 24:01.305
Outside? No.

24:01.307 --> 24:02.606
You?

24:02.608 --> 24:03.774
No.

24:03.776 --> 24:05.676
Oh.

24:05.678 --> 24:07.978
What was I saying?

24:07.980 --> 24:10.448
You said you were normal and...

24:10.450 --> 24:13.751
That's right. I am
perfectly normal and...

24:13.753 --> 24:16.353
Hey, if you gotta
go, you gotta go.

24:16.355 --> 24:17.655
Don't let me stop you.

24:17.657 --> 24:18.522
What?

24:18.524 --> 24:20.257
You just said...

24:20.259 --> 24:21.792
I didn't say anything.

24:21.794 --> 24:23.093
Are you sure?

24:23.095 --> 24:24.528
I think I'd know.

24:24.530 --> 24:25.362
Then you?

24:25.364 --> 24:26.931
Nothing.

24:33.339 --> 24:35.773
Arf!

24:35.775 --> 24:37.441
Oh, no.

24:37.443 --> 24:40.044
What is it?

24:40.046 --> 24:42.346
He just...

24:42.348 --> 24:44.615
I just...

24:44.617 --> 24:46.550
Oooh!

24:47.820 --> 24:49.320
Do you know what this means?

24:49.322 --> 24:52.623
Yes. The dog wants
to go outside.

24:52.625 --> 24:54.525
How did you know that?

24:54.527 --> 24:58.195
Because dogs always make
those whining noises

24:58.197 --> 25:00.164
When they want to go out.

25:00.166 --> 25:03.767
Oh. Right.

25:04.971 --> 25:07.805
I'm a dog therapist.
I know that.

25:07.807 --> 25:10.474
Will you excuse us
for just a minute?

25:10.476 --> 25:13.110
Can I talk to you?

25:17.984 --> 25:19.650
I'm hearing you inside my head.

25:19.652 --> 25:22.019
And you can understand me
too, can't you?

25:22.021 --> 25:22.853
Arf!

25:22.855 --> 25:24.655
Why didn't you tell me

25:24.657 --> 25:25.756
When we first met at the office?

25:25.758 --> 25:27.091
Arf!

25:27.093 --> 25:28.759
All right, maybe I
wasn't listening,

25:28.761 --> 25:30.227
But I had a lot on my mind.

25:30.229 --> 25:32.096
He's talking to the dog.

25:32.098 --> 25:33.664
He's very strange.

25:33.666 --> 25:34.999
You don't understand.

25:35.001 --> 25:36.200
After all these years
it's come back.

25:36.202 --> 25:37.434
Why now?

25:37.436 --> 25:39.370
I knew this setup was
too good to be true.

25:39.372 --> 25:40.704
Arf!

25:40.706 --> 25:41.939
I know you need to go out.

25:41.941 --> 25:43.107
Just hold it, will you?

25:43.109 --> 25:45.743
Listen. I have been
through this before

25:45.745 --> 25:46.677
And it's no fun for me.

25:46.679 --> 25:48.846
Arf! Arf! Arf!

25:48.848 --> 25:50.848
All right, slow down, will ya?

25:50.850 --> 25:52.416
I haven't done this
since I was a kid.

25:55.121 --> 25:57.121
Wait a minute.

25:57.123 --> 25:58.856
This could be worse
than I thought.

26:01.894 --> 26:04.261
All right, listen.

26:04.263 --> 26:05.696
I've got to ask you something.

26:05.698 --> 26:08.198
This is very important so
think it through carefully.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.267
What's your personality like?

26:10.269 --> 26:12.269
Do you get over excited easily?

26:12.271 --> 26:15.439
All right, you don't strike as
the type that gets too hyper.

26:15.441 --> 26:18.275
And that's good because it's
very important to stay calm.

26:18.277 --> 26:21.412
Whatever you do, you don't
want to get too emotional.

26:21.414 --> 26:25.549
Now, tail wagging is
acceptable in moderation.

26:25.551 --> 26:29.086
An occasional outbreak
of barking or a token
growl is fine too.

26:29.088 --> 26:30.955
You just don't want
to get too excited.

26:30.957 --> 26:34.358
Because it's bad.
It's real bad.

26:35.761 --> 26:37.127
Why is it bad?

26:37.129 --> 26:38.729
You don't want to know.

26:38.731 --> 26:40.965
People might think I'm nuts.

26:40.967 --> 26:44.134
He's definitely nuts.

26:44.136 --> 26:45.769
Arf! Arf! Arf!

26:45.771 --> 26:46.804
All right, already.

26:46.806 --> 26:48.439
I heard you the first two times.

26:48.441 --> 26:50.841
You want to go out,
we'll go out.

26:54.847 --> 26:57.448
Don't think you're gonna
be barking out orders at
me, either.

26:57.450 --> 26:59.750
That's not how it's gonna
work around here.

27:00.953 --> 27:02.620
Are you listening to me?

27:02.622 --> 27:05.255
That's the same spot you're
circled three times now.

27:05.257 --> 27:06.337
Don't you recognize it yet.

27:07.627 --> 27:10.861
Sorry. I didn't mean to throw
off your concentration.

27:15.301 --> 27:18.268
Oh, that's the spot, huh?

27:18.270 --> 27:20.938
Great! I think you made
a fine choice.

27:23.676 --> 27:25.109
What?

27:25.111 --> 27:29.146
Oh, for crying out loud.
I'm not watching.

27:29.148 --> 27:30.748
I'm waiting.

27:32.551 --> 27:34.785
All right, no problem.

27:34.787 --> 27:36.854
I guess I wouldn't want
to be watched either.

27:42.228 --> 27:43.861
Are you finished?

27:43.863 --> 27:45.763
Hello?

27:49.035 --> 27:50.701
What?

27:52.705 --> 27:54.805
A bone?

27:54.807 --> 27:57.141
All right, just calm down.

27:57.143 --> 27:58.242
It's just a bone.

27:58.244 --> 28:00.244
Stay calm.

28:00.246 --> 28:03.647
Lucky, just relax, will ya?

28:03.649 --> 28:06.784
I thought you said you didn't
get excited that easy...

28:09.255 --> 28:11.855
Oh, no.

28:11.857 --> 28:13.757
No! No!

28:19.165 --> 28:22.299
What in the world?

28:31.744 --> 28:33.110
Excuse me.

28:33.112 --> 28:35.512
Excuse me!

28:37.550 --> 28:40.284
Are you sure you're all right?

28:40.286 --> 28:42.286
I'm fine. Just
looking for a bone.

28:42.288 --> 28:45.923
A...A... A what?

28:45.925 --> 28:48.425
A bone. A bone. I need
to find a bone.

28:48.427 --> 28:50.294
I buried a big juicy bone
out here a few nights ago

28:50.296 --> 28:51.628
And I can't remember
where it is.

28:51.630 --> 28:53.197
It's driving me crazy.

28:55.134 --> 28:57.367
I can smell it. I know
it's in here.

28:57.369 --> 28:58.769
I can just taste it too.

29:01.941 --> 29:04.374
Hold the phone. This
could be gravy.

29:07.113 --> 29:09.947
Hallelujah, it's still
got some meat on it.

29:09.949 --> 29:12.983
You need help.

29:12.985 --> 29:15.452
Baby, I could just chew
on you all night.

29:15.454 --> 29:17.421
How dare you!

29:17.423 --> 29:19.890
Oh, come here, you tasty morsel.

29:56.629 --> 29:59.663
I think he's dangerous.

29:59.665 --> 30:01.398
That guy's a fruitcake.

30:25.658 --> 30:29.526
He's one sick puppy.

30:34.633 --> 30:36.967
Excuse me.

30:36.969 --> 30:40.637
I just wanted to let you
know we're leaving now.

30:40.639 --> 30:43.373
It's nothing personal,

30:43.375 --> 30:46.743
But I think you might be
possessed by the devil
or something.

30:46.745 --> 30:49.046
So we're just going to go now.

31:54.880 --> 31:57.481
Oh, my head.

32:08.060 --> 32:10.360
My shoe!

32:11.330 --> 32:13.797
Lucky, wake up.
We gotta talk.

32:17.803 --> 32:20.437
Hey, look at this place.

32:20.439 --> 32:21.905
Look at you.

32:21.907 --> 32:23.140
Look at me.

32:23.142 --> 32:26.543
What did we do last night,
raid the city dump?

32:27.579 --> 32:29.446
Wait. Don't even
answer that.

32:29.448 --> 32:31.782
What did I get myself into?

32:31.784 --> 32:35.919
All right, this is not
gonna go on like this.

32:35.921 --> 32:37.621
Do you understand?

32:37.623 --> 32:39.957
You have got to concentrate
on not getting excited

32:39.959 --> 32:42.125
And behaving yourself.

32:42.127 --> 32:43.360
You got it?

32:44.763 --> 32:46.496
All right, then.

32:50.703 --> 32:53.303
64 million dollars.

32:53.305 --> 32:55.839
Just keep reminding
yourself of that.

32:55.841 --> 32:57.874
Ahem, I hate to interrupt.

32:59.445 --> 33:00.844
Ah, good morning.

33:00.846 --> 33:02.379
Morning.

33:03.349 --> 33:07.184
So, you talk to the dog, huh?

33:07.186 --> 33:09.519
Yes, I do.

33:09.521 --> 33:11.955
And he understands you?

33:11.957 --> 33:14.958
I'm afraid so.

33:14.960 --> 33:16.626
And you understand him.

33:16.628 --> 33:18.495
That's right.

33:18.497 --> 33:22.699
Ok. I see.

33:22.701 --> 33:25.002
You know, I've known ol'
lucky here for a few years.

33:25.004 --> 33:27.070
Why don't you ask him
why he chewed up

33:27.072 --> 33:29.339
My brand new italian
leather gloves last
week?

33:29.341 --> 33:31.141
I'd really like to know that.

33:33.846 --> 33:35.812
Well?

33:40.352 --> 33:43.020
He says he couldn't resist.

33:43.022 --> 33:44.554
He loves italian food.

33:46.025 --> 33:48.091
Is that so?

33:50.596 --> 33:53.430
I guess they would be
pretty tasty at that.

33:57.036 --> 34:00.070
Why don't you clean yourself up?

34:00.072 --> 34:01.772
I'll make us a pot of coffee.

34:03.442 --> 34:05.042
Thanks.

34:05.044 --> 34:07.177
Uh-huh.

34:13.351 --> 34:15.452
Look at this stuff, man.

34:15.454 --> 34:18.188
What are you, a
walking garbage can?

34:22.027 --> 34:25.962
So, how weird did things
get last night?

34:25.964 --> 34:28.264
Let's just say for the
first time in my life,

34:28.266 --> 34:31.101
I locked my bedroom door and
slept with my light on.

34:31.103 --> 34:32.601
That bad, huh?

34:32.603 --> 34:36.406
You want to tell me
what's going on
here, chief?

34:36.408 --> 34:38.308
Not really.

34:41.713 --> 34:45.114
Ok. Ok, listen.

34:45.117 --> 34:49.152
When lucky gets excited,

34:49.154 --> 34:53.790
When he gets really,
really excited,

34:53.792 --> 34:59.096
His personality kind
of jumps into me.

34:59.098 --> 35:02.966
And then I kind of become him.

35:02.968 --> 35:05.001
Arf!

35:05.003 --> 35:07.471
What?

35:07.473 --> 35:10.273
You know, it's kind of like...

35:10.275 --> 35:12.676
Channeling.

35:12.678 --> 35:15.178
You become a dog?

35:15.180 --> 35:18.348
Cold nose, car
chasing, the works.

35:18.350 --> 35:21.952
He expects me to believe this.

35:21.954 --> 35:23.587
What, you think I'm
making this up?

35:26.992 --> 35:29.259
Hey, listen, calvin.

35:29.261 --> 35:31.294
I wouldn't blame
you if you left.

35:31.296 --> 35:33.330
I've been here 15 years.

35:33.332 --> 35:35.632
I've got a good thing
going here. It's home.

35:35.634 --> 35:37.634
I want it to stay that way

35:37.636 --> 35:39.369
But if you keep on
pretending to be lassie

35:39.371 --> 35:41.037
They're gonna run us out of here

35:41.039 --> 35:43.119
Quicker than you can say,
"timmy fell down the well."

35:50.182 --> 35:52.616
Can I fix you some breakfast?

35:52.618 --> 35:56.720
Bacon? Eggs? Kibble?

35:56.722 --> 35:59.856
No, thanks. I had too
much garbage last night.

36:02.127 --> 36:05.695
Hey, how about you,
fella? You hungry?

36:05.697 --> 36:08.365
No. He hasn't had
much of an appetite

36:08.367 --> 36:09.647
Since the night
the old man died.

36:11.837 --> 36:13.136
Here you go, lucky.

36:13.138 --> 36:15.205
Breakfast fit for a king.

36:17.676 --> 36:19.709
You've got to eat, lucky.

36:23.649 --> 36:25.415
What's bothering you, pal?

36:37.229 --> 36:39.863
Not tonight, lucky.

36:39.865 --> 36:42.499
It's the coldest night
of the year.

36:46.872 --> 36:49.105
Arf!

36:49.107 --> 36:53.610
You know just how to get
to me, don't you, boy?

36:53.612 --> 36:56.780
All right, all right, come on.

37:04.690 --> 37:08.625
You're going too
fast for me, lucky.

37:08.627 --> 37:13.597
Wait a minute. You'll be
ok on your own.

37:35.287 --> 37:37.520
Arf! Arf! Arf!

37:42.828 --> 37:45.829
Lucky, it wasn't your fault.
He was an old man.

37:47.633 --> 37:49.299
I know you miss him,

37:49.301 --> 37:51.935
But sooner or later, you've
got to let him go.

37:51.937 --> 37:54.838
Just try to remember the good
times you had together

37:54.840 --> 37:57.140
Like going for walks,

37:57.142 --> 37:58.475
And riding in the car.

37:58.477 --> 38:00.777
Those are the things that
he left behind for you.

38:00.779 --> 38:03.313
That's what you have
to hold on to.

38:05.951 --> 38:08.151
In the meantime,
you've got to eat.

38:13.158 --> 38:15.792
I know. You need a
change of scenery.

38:15.794 --> 38:17.994
What do you say we go someplace?

38:17.996 --> 38:19.796
Arf!

38:19.798 --> 38:21.698
Oh, you like that idea, huh?

38:21.700 --> 38:22.766
Where do you want to go?

38:22.768 --> 38:27.137
What? You want to go where?

38:27.139 --> 38:31.675
Oh, no. Not the mall.

38:31.677 --> 38:33.243
Ok, all right, all right.

38:35.981 --> 38:39.449
We've decided to go to the mall.

38:39.451 --> 38:40.850
The mall?

38:42.287 --> 38:46.690
Ok. Well, I'll bring
the car around.

38:50.395 --> 38:53.697
All right. Just don't get
yourself all worked up.

38:53.699 --> 38:55.398
Ok, we're going to the mall.

38:55.400 --> 38:58.034
Just stay calm. Calm.

39:02.641 --> 39:05.975
Oh boy, oh boy, we're
going for a ride.

39:31.103 --> 39:33.169
I apologize if you're not,

39:33.171 --> 39:36.539
But are you by any chance
the dog right now?

39:36.541 --> 39:39.209
I'm covered in fur, aren't I?
Who else would I be?

39:39.211 --> 39:40.276
Come on, let's roll.

39:42.414 --> 39:45.949
Hold it. Serious
itch coming on.

39:53.725 --> 39:57.260
Oh, honey. Come on,
bring it on home.

39:58.930 --> 40:00.463
That's better.

40:00.465 --> 40:02.465
Ever get one right
behind the ear?

40:02.467 --> 40:06.102
That can drive you crazy.

40:06.104 --> 40:08.671
Come on, let's get this
bucket on the road.

40:10.642 --> 40:12.609
I'm gonna need a lot more
money for this gig.

40:12.611 --> 40:13.843
I can see that right now.

40:42.741 --> 40:45.108
Ha ha ha! Look at 'em!

40:45.110 --> 40:46.676
Better than we
could've hoped for.

40:49.114 --> 40:51.381
He's a total maniac!

40:52.751 --> 40:54.284
Get close to the limousine

40:54.286 --> 40:56.453
So we can get 'em
on tape. Hurry!

40:56.455 --> 40:58.087
I know what I'm doing.

41:00.125 --> 41:01.257
Are you getting this on video?

41:01.259 --> 41:02.692
Every bark of it.

41:10.936 --> 41:14.437
Hurry up, stupid!
They're getting away.

41:14.439 --> 41:17.006
Would you stop telling
me how to drive?!

41:17.008 --> 41:18.174
You don't even have a license.

41:18.176 --> 41:21.411
And don't call me
stupid anymore.

41:22.814 --> 41:24.514
Look out!

41:28.386 --> 41:30.286
Now you've done it, lyle!

41:30.288 --> 41:31.688
Well, it was your fault.

41:31.690 --> 41:34.858
At least we have
that raving idiot
on video tape.

41:34.860 --> 41:38.127
Oh, no. I forgot to
put a video tape in
this thing.

41:38.129 --> 41:40.096
You what?!

41:41.833 --> 41:43.099
Go, go, go, go, go!

41:44.336 --> 41:46.035
Come back here!

41:52.143 --> 41:55.044
Well, we've lost them.

41:55.046 --> 41:57.814
Well, it's time to stop
pussyfooting around.

41:57.816 --> 42:00.817
Don't you think it'll
look a tad suspicious

42:00.819 --> 42:02.685
If something happens to
the dog so soon?

42:02.687 --> 42:04.721
I pulled it off the
first time, didn't I?

42:04.723 --> 42:08.091
We'll break into the
house and we'll get
the mutt tonight.

42:08.093 --> 42:11.494
This time next week
we'll be sleeping in
our own beds.

42:11.496 --> 42:13.696
Everybody in sync?

42:13.698 --> 42:16.099
Maybe I could make a
deal with him?

42:16.101 --> 42:17.834
The dog?

42:17.836 --> 42:22.005
No, our mr. Morgan.

42:22.007 --> 42:23.907
Oh.

42:24.876 --> 42:29.112
I'll use my irresistible charm.

42:29.114 --> 42:30.947
Right.

42:36.288 --> 42:37.420
Stop that.

42:37.422 --> 42:39.422
Stop that!

42:40.191 --> 42:41.424
I gotta chew! I gotta chew!

42:41.426 --> 42:45.295
Oh, there's happy bumps in
the glove compartment.

42:47.699 --> 42:49.799
All right,
already. Here.

43:07.285 --> 43:09.752
Wow. What just happened?

43:09.754 --> 43:11.788
You took another little
trip to the rubber
kennel.

43:11.790 --> 43:15.224
We've got to figure out
a way to keep lucky

43:15.226 --> 43:16.593
From getting so excited.

43:16.595 --> 43:18.194
Whatever you say, boss.

43:21.166 --> 43:22.799
Hello?

43:22.801 --> 43:24.834
Ah, yes, he is,
ms. Kent.

43:24.836 --> 43:26.102
Just a minute.

43:26.104 --> 43:27.303
Now, remember, you be careful

43:27.305 --> 43:28.825
Or you're gonna blow
it for both of us.

43:29.774 --> 43:31.441
Hello, allison.

43:31.443 --> 43:32.909
Hi, how are you?

43:32.911 --> 43:35.778
Sure, sure, I'd love to
sign some more papers.

43:35.780 --> 43:38.081
But right now we're on
our way to the mall.

43:38.083 --> 43:40.149
Why don't you
just meet us
there?

43:41.286 --> 43:43.586
Your daughter? I didn't
know you had...

43:43.588 --> 43:45.021
Well, bring her along.

43:45.023 --> 43:48.825
We're going to the pet store.

43:48.827 --> 43:50.226
Where else is a dog gonna shop?

44:00.105 --> 44:02.338
I hate to break it
to you, lucky,

44:02.340 --> 44:04.941
But dogs just don't
buy furniture.

44:04.943 --> 44:09.112
A new dish, maybe,
or a studded collar.

44:09.114 --> 44:10.380
Arf! Arf!

44:10.382 --> 44:11.981
It does look comfortable, but...

44:11.983 --> 44:14.384
I don't need to try it.

44:14.386 --> 44:15.618
Look, it's your money.

44:15.620 --> 44:17.620
If you really like it
go ahead and buy it.

44:17.622 --> 44:21.624
All right, I'll
try it. Relax.

44:21.626 --> 44:23.359
Remember, you're got
to stay cool.

44:25.530 --> 44:28.197
Ooh, you're right.
This is nice.

44:28.199 --> 44:30.767
And the leather doesn't rub
your fur the wrong way.

44:31.836 --> 44:34.971
Get the dog off the
sofa, please.

44:34.973 --> 44:38.641
Oh, sorry, but he
insists on checking it
out before we buy it.

44:38.643 --> 44:40.543
Well, it happens to be
our finest model.

44:40.545 --> 44:42.078
$5,000.

44:42.080 --> 44:45.314
What? Five grand
for a sofa?

44:45.316 --> 44:47.417
Arf! Arf!

44:47.419 --> 44:48.518
Are you sure?

44:48.520 --> 44:51.921
Arf! Arf! Arf!

44:51.923 --> 44:53.222
Whatever you say.

44:53.224 --> 44:55.191
We'll take it.

44:55.193 --> 44:58.194
Arf! Arf!

44:58.196 --> 44:59.328
And that one.

44:59.330 --> 45:01.364
Arf!

45:01.366 --> 45:02.165
And that one.

45:02.167 --> 45:03.866
Arf! Arf! Arf!

45:03.868 --> 45:06.903
And the two red ones
over by the door.

45:06.905 --> 45:10.173
Very well. We can make
delivery next week.

45:14.112 --> 45:16.679
No. I'm sorry. He wants them
tomorrow or the deal's off.

45:20.618 --> 45:23.086
Would a 10:00 delivery
be satisfactory?

45:27.358 --> 45:29.025
Come on. Make up
your mind, lucky.

45:33.765 --> 45:35.898
Great!

45:35.900 --> 45:38.134
We'll take a pair of these too.

45:48.980 --> 45:51.714
Hey, here's a nice one.

45:51.716 --> 45:53.282
Soft, squeaky.

45:53.284 --> 45:55.351
Give it a test chew.
See what you think.

45:58.823 --> 46:00.823
Too squeaky?

46:00.825 --> 46:02.024
Fine.

46:05.897 --> 46:08.965
Here's something no home
should be without...

46:08.967 --> 46:11.334
A green lamb chop.
What do you think?

46:12.771 --> 46:14.370
Nah. I didn't
like it either.

46:15.607 --> 46:17.173
Oh, look at this...

46:17.175 --> 46:20.109
Cheese-filled, smokey flavor...

46:20.111 --> 46:22.111
How about one of these?

46:22.113 --> 46:23.446
Arf! Arf!

46:23.448 --> 46:25.148
Two of 'em?

46:25.150 --> 46:26.182
Ok.

46:26.184 --> 46:28.351
All of 'em?

46:28.353 --> 46:29.719
All right.

46:31.089 --> 46:33.289
I should taste-test
this stuff myself

46:33.291 --> 46:35.858
Because I'll probably end up
chewing on most of it.

46:38.463 --> 46:40.229
Now what?

46:46.471 --> 46:50.807
Ok, this shopping spree
is officially over.

46:50.809 --> 46:52.708
Come on.

46:57.649 --> 46:59.282
May I have him, mom?

46:59.284 --> 47:01.050
I'll take care of
him. I promise.

47:01.052 --> 47:02.618
It's not that easy, honey.

47:02.620 --> 47:04.787
The apartment's no
place for a puppy.

47:04.789 --> 47:06.355
He needs a yard to play in.

47:06.357 --> 47:08.057
Let's move back to
the house with dad.

47:08.059 --> 47:09.725
He has a yard and everything.

47:09.727 --> 47:12.662
Nicole, you know we
can't do that.

47:12.664 --> 47:16.866
Hi! Oh, what a
cute puppy.

47:19.037 --> 47:20.469
Did I say the wrong thing?

47:21.472 --> 47:23.806
We don't have room for a puppy

47:23.808 --> 47:25.041
Because my dad got the house.

47:25.043 --> 47:26.309
Nicole!

47:26.311 --> 47:27.877
She's not married.

47:28.847 --> 47:30.913
He likes me.
What's his name?

47:30.915 --> 47:32.648
Lucky. And I'm jack.

47:32.650 --> 47:34.417
I bet lucky would love it

47:34.419 --> 47:35.818
If you came over to
play sometime.

47:35.820 --> 47:37.053
Can I, mom?

47:37.055 --> 47:38.321
We'll see, honey.

47:38.323 --> 47:40.923
Hear that, lucky. We're
gonna be friends.

47:40.925 --> 47:42.325
There you go.
You got him?

47:43.761 --> 47:46.062
Thanks. That was
really sweet.

47:46.064 --> 47:47.897
Oh, sure.

47:47.899 --> 47:50.199
Any friend of lucky's
is a friend of mine.

47:50.201 --> 47:53.836
Hey, I have some
documents I need you to
sign if you don't mind.

47:53.838 --> 47:55.204
No problemo.

47:55.206 --> 47:58.774
All right.

47:58.776 --> 48:01.444
Alrighty, right there
on the dotted line?

48:01.446 --> 48:03.079
Yep, right there.

48:08.553 --> 48:10.286
You don't like cats?

48:10.288 --> 48:11.921
Huh?

48:11.923 --> 48:14.457
Mom, lucky wants to lead!

48:14.459 --> 48:15.625
Do you have time
for a little walk?

48:15.627 --> 48:17.026
Sure.

48:17.028 --> 48:18.694
Hold on, nic. We're coming.

48:20.598 --> 48:23.099
The last time I spent an
afternoon just hanging
out at the mall

48:23.101 --> 48:25.468
I was still living in nebraska.

48:25.470 --> 48:28.271
Nebraska? What was your
other entertainment
option,

48:28.273 --> 48:29.972
Tipping over the neighbor's cow?

48:29.974 --> 48:33.209
For your information, there's a
lot of fun things to do in the
midwest.

48:33.211 --> 48:35.444
My sisters and my cousins,
we'd all hang out.

48:35.446 --> 48:37.947
My mom used to call us
the seven musketeers.

48:37.949 --> 48:39.548
Wow, there was seven of you?

48:39.550 --> 48:42.718
Boy, it must seem real
quiet now with just you
and nicole.

48:42.720 --> 48:44.287
Quiet's ok.

48:44.289 --> 48:47.156
But I think she's missing
out on something really
special.

48:47.158 --> 48:51.294
Being from a big family,
there was always someone
there for you.

48:51.296 --> 48:53.162
Always.

49:11.482 --> 49:13.449
Thanks for the ride, jack.

49:13.451 --> 49:15.584
Oh, you're welcome.
I love trains.

49:15.586 --> 49:17.954
When I was little I always
wanted to be an engineer.

49:17.956 --> 49:21.157
You know, for a bachelor,
you're pretty good with kids.

49:21.159 --> 49:23.292
Oh, well, thanks.

49:23.294 --> 49:25.027
I guess I do have a
sensitive side.

49:25.029 --> 49:28.297
I'm not one of those guys who
cries at the drop of a hat,

49:28.299 --> 49:32.034
But I do like kids.
And girls too.

49:32.036 --> 49:35.004
In fact, allison, would
you ever consider...

49:40.645 --> 49:42.545
Wonton chicken!

49:42.547 --> 49:43.679
Excuse me.

49:45.550 --> 49:47.616
Sweet and sour pork.

49:47.618 --> 49:48.784
What?

49:48.786 --> 49:51.354
I can smell it. It's
near. It's near.

49:54.392 --> 49:57.960
Yeah, it's probably over
at wonton tommie's.

49:59.497 --> 50:01.364
Yeee-haaaa!

50:03.634 --> 50:05.701
They must be pretty hungry.

50:05.703 --> 50:08.738
I guess so, honey.

50:08.740 --> 50:10.473
Come on. Let's go.

50:24.255 --> 50:26.389
Gotta have more, more.

50:26.391 --> 50:29.492
Table scraps. Table scraps.

51:00.858 --> 51:03.793
What is all this? Are they
remodeling the place?

51:03.795 --> 51:06.195
It looks like he bought
the whole stupid town.

51:09.734 --> 51:13.102
He's having steaks delivered.

51:13.104 --> 51:14.603
Tons of them.

51:14.605 --> 51:16.939
What? Give me those!

51:23.915 --> 51:26.882
Hundreds of chew toys?

51:26.884 --> 51:28.951
I don't believe this.

51:31.422 --> 51:34.290
Now's the time to make my move.

51:39.797 --> 51:41.797
How many dogs you
got here, anyway?

51:41.799 --> 51:43.466
Just one.

51:43.468 --> 51:47.436
But he and the dog have a
very special relationship.

51:47.438 --> 51:51.307
Just go pile this up with
the rest of the stuff.

51:52.610 --> 51:54.110
Admit it, you overdid it.

51:54.112 --> 51:55.952
Now where're we supposed
to put all this stuff?

51:58.816 --> 52:00.916
Lucky, come on, come on.

52:00.918 --> 52:02.251
Can't you wait till dinnertime?

52:02.253 --> 52:04.753
Yoo-hoo! Hello there.

52:04.755 --> 52:07.957
Oh, my dear boy,

52:07.959 --> 52:11.093
Please allow me to apologize

52:11.095 --> 52:12.795
For my behavior the other day.

52:12.797 --> 52:14.930
Say you'll forgive me.

52:14.932 --> 52:18.000
Ok. Yeah, sure.

52:18.002 --> 52:21.337
You can't imaging how
distraught I was

52:21.339 --> 52:24.807
Over the sudden passing
of my beloved uncle.

52:24.809 --> 52:30.146
But you seem like a
reasonable young man.

52:30.148 --> 52:31.647
Uh-huh.

52:31.649 --> 52:33.716
Good.

52:33.718 --> 52:36.352
Then we can discuss business.

52:38.789 --> 52:42.191
What on earth are you
doing to this house?

52:42.193 --> 52:43.859
Oh, we're tearing out
the marble floors.

52:43.861 --> 52:45.794
You're what?

52:45.796 --> 52:47.630
It was lucky's idea, not mine.

52:47.632 --> 52:49.331
That is curara marble!

52:49.333 --> 52:50.633
Imported from naples,

52:50.635 --> 52:52.201
Hand carved and polished!

52:52.203 --> 52:54.803
Yeah, but you should
try running on it.

52:54.805 --> 52:56.739
Your paws slip all
over the place.

52:56.741 --> 52:58.974
Especially if you're taking
a really sharp turn.

52:58.976 --> 53:01.510
I see.

53:01.512 --> 53:06.081
Do you mind if I ask
what you intend to
replace it with?

53:06.083 --> 53:07.950
Watch it, lady.

53:12.256 --> 53:13.489
Astro turf.

53:13.491 --> 53:16.025
Oooh! Ha ha.

53:16.027 --> 53:18.894
But of course.

53:18.896 --> 53:22.264
Where were we?

53:22.266 --> 53:25.734
Oh, yes. Business.

53:25.736 --> 53:28.871
I was thinking, perhaps
there's a way

53:28.873 --> 53:30.439
That we could both profit.

53:30.441 --> 53:31.740
Would you look at that?!

53:31.742 --> 53:32.575
What?

53:32.577 --> 53:33.909
Bones!

53:37.281 --> 53:40.449
Beef-basted, crunchy, munchy,

53:40.451 --> 53:42.685
Grade-a, certified bones!

53:42.687 --> 53:45.421
My goodness! Get a
hold of yourself.

53:45.423 --> 53:48.023
You know what I'm gonna do
with those bones, don't you?

53:48.025 --> 53:49.858
Bury 'em!

53:49.860 --> 53:51.594
But why?

53:51.596 --> 53:53.896
Duh. So I can dig
'em up again.

53:53.898 --> 53:56.599
That seems rather
silly, doesn't it?

53:56.601 --> 53:59.034
You don't understand, do you?

53:59.036 --> 54:00.703
You never did.

54:00.705 --> 54:02.137
You gotta dig 'em up.

54:02.139 --> 54:03.872
Think about it.

54:03.874 --> 54:05.608
It's 2:00 in the morning

54:05.610 --> 54:07.443
And you got nothing to do.

54:07.445 --> 54:09.612
All of a sudden, you remember...

54:09.614 --> 54:12.248
There's a bone
buried in the yard!

54:12.250 --> 54:14.950
I can dig it up and
chew it to pieces.

54:16.320 --> 54:19.788
You're nothing but
a dirty, filthy,

54:19.790 --> 54:22.458
Disgusting young man!

54:22.460 --> 54:23.826
What did you say?

54:23.828 --> 54:25.628
Stay away from me.

54:25.630 --> 54:28.430
There's something I've
always wanted to do.

54:28.432 --> 54:29.798
Arf! Arf! Arf!

54:29.800 --> 54:31.367
I'm warning you!

54:37.608 --> 54:39.708
Aaaaah!

54:48.019 --> 54:49.351
Well?

54:49.353 --> 54:51.954
Did you make a deal with him?

54:51.956 --> 54:52.755
Not exactly.

54:52.757 --> 54:54.156
What happened?

54:54.158 --> 54:57.926
Let's just say he's a
very disturbed young man.

55:05.136 --> 55:07.469
All right, then, we're
gonna do it my way.

55:07.471 --> 55:10.973
And I'm gonna really
enjoy planning this one.

55:10.975 --> 55:12.508
Let's go.

55:20.685 --> 55:22.851
I'll see if everything's ready.

55:25.356 --> 55:27.389
Just wait here a
minute, all right?

55:28.659 --> 55:30.826
Calvin, you ready?

55:30.828 --> 55:32.061
Oh, yeah. It's
all done.

55:32.063 --> 55:33.128
Shhh.

55:33.130 --> 55:34.797
I hope he likes it.

55:34.799 --> 55:37.232
I'm having a ball
watching him throw
windsor's money around.

55:37.234 --> 55:39.635
That's the way a dog is
when he's free to do
whatever he wants.

55:39.637 --> 55:40.869
Reckless abandon.

55:42.139 --> 55:44.039
Hey, calvin,

55:44.041 --> 55:48.811
I really appreciate you
keeping all my little
freak-outs a secret.

55:48.813 --> 55:51.413
I just don't want anyone
to know about this.

55:51.415 --> 55:54.149
Especially not mr. Windsor's
attorney, ms. Kent,

55:54.151 --> 55:55.317
All right?

55:55.319 --> 55:56.752
No problem.

55:56.754 --> 55:58.120
Thanks.

55:59.590 --> 56:02.257
All right, lucky, come on.

56:02.259 --> 56:03.659
Time to play.

56:05.730 --> 56:06.929
Come on in.

56:06.931 --> 56:08.097
Come on.

56:08.099 --> 56:09.932
It's all yours, luck.

56:09.934 --> 56:11.900
Look what we set up
for you, lucky.

56:11.902 --> 56:14.436
Your very own sidewalk cafe.

56:14.438 --> 56:16.939
With today's special,
leg of moose.

56:21.112 --> 56:23.479
You made your mark, lucky.

56:25.616 --> 56:28.384
Cold cuts, hot dogs,

56:28.386 --> 56:30.285
Lamb chops, pork chops,

56:30.287 --> 56:32.454
Roast beef and burgers,

56:32.456 --> 56:35.224
Kibble by the carload,

56:35.226 --> 56:37.860
Lip-smacking,
liver-flavored candy,

56:37.862 --> 56:41.430
Gumballs that make
their own gravy.

56:41.432 --> 56:44.600
How about a couple of barrels
full of lo-cal chew toys?

56:46.570 --> 56:48.303
Well, what do you think?

56:48.305 --> 56:50.172
Wait till you see the
rest of this stuff.

56:55.279 --> 56:56.879
Wait till you see this.

56:56.881 --> 56:58.313
You're not gonna believe it.

57:08.626 --> 57:11.126
Lucky, looks like
you hit the jackpot.

57:13.397 --> 57:15.798
Come on, lucky.
Get 'em. Get 'em.

57:24.275 --> 57:26.241
You still miss mr.
Windsor, don't you?

57:29.580 --> 57:32.281
It'll be all right, fella.

57:32.283 --> 57:34.450
We'll get through this together.

57:34.452 --> 57:37.519
All right? It's just
gonna take some time.

57:37.521 --> 57:39.087
Right now, I am pooped.

57:39.089 --> 57:40.689
I'm going to bed.

57:40.691 --> 57:43.292
I had no idea taking
care of a pile of money

57:43.294 --> 57:44.726
Could be so exhausting.

57:52.136 --> 57:55.504
Hey, what you doing, lucky?

57:55.506 --> 57:57.473
Looks like he wants to play.

57:57.475 --> 57:59.842
That just figures.

57:59.844 --> 58:01.977
We've got thousands of dollars
worth of toys in here

58:01.979 --> 58:03.278
And he wants to play
with a sock.

58:03.280 --> 58:04.980
Ha ha ha.

58:04.982 --> 58:06.515
All right.

58:12.289 --> 58:13.989
All right, come on, come on.

58:13.991 --> 58:15.524
I'm gonna get it.
I'm gonna get it.

58:23.834 --> 58:27.636
All right, lucky, we'll play
again tomorrow, ok?

58:27.638 --> 58:29.905
I'm beat. I'll catch you
in the morning, calvin.

58:29.907 --> 58:31.373
Ok. Good night, jack.

58:31.375 --> 58:32.441
Good night, lucky.

58:34.245 --> 58:36.078
What?

58:37.481 --> 58:40.549
No, no, no. We are
not starting that.

58:42.887 --> 58:44.820
No means no.

58:48.058 --> 58:50.559
Oh, all right.

58:50.561 --> 58:51.660
But only for tonight.

59:07.711 --> 59:10.612
It's the last time I send
you to buy disguises.

59:10.614 --> 59:13.348
You have no sense of
taste or style.

59:13.350 --> 59:14.750
It's all we can afford.

59:14.752 --> 59:17.452
Will you two just
shut up and get out
of the car?

59:19.623 --> 59:22.291
Get out of the way.

59:40.277 --> 59:42.411
We don't need a
ladder, margaret.

59:42.413 --> 59:45.647
It'll be easy to
climb the fence.

59:45.649 --> 59:47.549
They're gonna hear us.

59:47.551 --> 59:49.952
Remind me to kill you when
I get down from here.

59:49.954 --> 59:53.021
It's diet time for
you, margaret.

59:53.624 --> 59:55.123
Ooh!

01:00:02.633 --> 01:00:04.166
Oowwh!

01:00:10.274 --> 01:00:13.008
Hey, what about me?

01:00:23.187 --> 01:00:25.721
He's gonna cut the alarm
and the telephones.

01:00:35.466 --> 01:00:36.765
All right!

01:00:36.767 --> 01:00:39.501
Now this is gonna take
all the lights out.

01:00:41.605 --> 01:00:43.472
We'll wake up the
entire neighborhood.

01:00:43.474 --> 01:00:45.807
Will you get that light
out of my face?!

01:00:45.809 --> 01:00:47.776
Follow me.

01:01:09.233 --> 01:01:11.233
He's an idiot.

01:01:11.235 --> 01:01:13.669
It's one big canine nightmare.

01:01:13.671 --> 01:01:16.038
I actually kind of
like this carpet.

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.005
Shhh!

01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:18.540
Ten-shun!

01:01:18.542 --> 01:01:20.375
Check your weapons.

01:01:22.746 --> 01:01:26.014
Remember, this dart has got
enough sedative in it

01:01:26.016 --> 01:01:28.050
To knock this mutt out cold.

01:01:28.052 --> 01:01:29.251
We're gonna shot him

01:01:29.253 --> 01:01:31.053
And then we're gonna
drag him out of here.

01:01:31.055 --> 01:01:32.454
All right?

01:01:33.524 --> 01:01:35.057
She has no camouflage on.

01:01:35.059 --> 01:01:37.859
You have... oh!

01:01:37.861 --> 01:01:39.861
Here.

01:01:39.863 --> 01:01:41.229
Do I have to?

01:01:45.035 --> 01:01:46.435
I'm sorry.

01:01:47.371 --> 01:01:49.237
Get with the program.

01:02:23.941 --> 01:02:25.674
Oh, I thought I got him.

01:03:00.410 --> 01:03:01.910
Ooh!

01:03:04.414 --> 01:03:06.414
Oow!

01:03:06.416 --> 01:03:09.151
What were you doing under there?

01:03:09.153 --> 01:03:10.552
I was hiding!

01:03:13.624 --> 01:03:17.125
Get up! Get up!

01:03:17.127 --> 01:03:20.028
I'll be fine... Whoa!

01:03:31.308 --> 01:03:34.276
If this is his
idea of decorating

01:03:34.278 --> 01:03:36.378
We oughta put a dart in him.

01:03:38.682 --> 01:03:40.615
Ooh! Ooow!

01:03:48.725 --> 01:03:51.226
Ha ha ha!

01:03:53.463 --> 01:03:55.697
Whooa!

01:03:59.970 --> 01:04:02.003
Wake up. Wake up, lucky.

01:04:02.005 --> 01:04:03.371
Did you hear that?

01:04:04.374 --> 01:04:05.907
Let's go check it out.

01:04:05.909 --> 01:04:09.144
You have to watch where
you aim that thing.

01:04:09.146 --> 01:04:12.047
Oh, let's just get out of here.

01:04:42.946 --> 01:04:45.914
There's someone in the house.

01:04:45.916 --> 01:04:48.016
Well, push the emergency
button on the alarm system.

01:04:48.018 --> 01:04:49.117
I tried it. It's dead.

01:04:49.119 --> 01:04:50.418
911?

01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:51.786
The phones are out too.

01:04:51.788 --> 01:04:53.588
Come on.

01:04:53.590 --> 01:04:55.056
You go downstairs.

01:04:55.058 --> 01:04:56.758
Lucky and I'll cover
the upstairs.

01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:58.426
Here. You're gonna need
something to protect
yourself with.

01:04:58.428 --> 01:04:59.928
What am I supposed to
do with this thing?

01:04:59.930 --> 01:05:01.796
Hit 'em with the dry end.

01:05:01.798 --> 01:05:03.665
Let's go.

01:05:55.285 --> 01:05:57.152
Aah!

01:05:57.154 --> 01:06:00.088
Will you stop sneaking
up on people?

01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:02.090
I was here first.

01:06:04.695 --> 01:06:06.394
Follow me.

01:06:32.055 --> 01:06:33.521
Aaaah!

01:06:36.293 --> 01:06:37.892
You cretins!

01:06:37.894 --> 01:06:39.334
Margaret, I thought
you were the dog.

01:06:43.133 --> 01:06:46.301
That's him. Shoot
him! Shoot him!

01:06:46.303 --> 01:06:47.135
Shut up!

01:06:47.137 --> 01:06:48.503
Where's your dart?

01:06:48.505 --> 01:06:50.071
I gotta reload.

01:06:50.073 --> 01:06:52.240
I'm the only one around here
man enough to do the job.

01:06:52.242 --> 01:06:54.609
All right, everybody, freeze!

01:06:58.815 --> 01:07:00.582
I missed.

01:07:01.918 --> 01:07:03.985
Grrrrr!

01:07:08.425 --> 01:07:10.658
Aaaah!

01:07:58.775 --> 01:08:00.608
Snap out of it!

01:08:00.610 --> 01:08:04.012
Come on, jack. Come on.

01:08:05.248 --> 01:08:07.449
I'm gonna go next door
and call the cops.

01:08:07.451 --> 01:08:09.117
I know who it was...

01:08:09.119 --> 01:08:10.618
Windsor's creepy relatives.

01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:11.620
Did you see them?

01:08:11.621 --> 01:08:14.255
No. It was too dark.

01:08:14.257 --> 01:08:15.723
Then how did you
know it was them?

01:08:15.725 --> 01:08:17.591
You smelled them?

01:08:17.594 --> 01:08:18.993
That's right.

01:08:18.995 --> 01:08:20.462
Excuse me.

01:08:20.464 --> 01:08:23.064
Detective, you're just gonna
have to take my word for it.

01:08:23.066 --> 01:08:24.399
I know their scent.

01:08:24.401 --> 01:08:26.768
What, cologne, a cigar?

01:08:26.770 --> 01:08:28.670
What exactly did you smell?

01:08:31.408 --> 01:08:33.274
Never mind.

01:08:33.276 --> 01:08:34.876
You'll never believe me.

01:08:39.616 --> 01:08:41.582
Send them in.

01:08:58.201 --> 01:09:02.303
Well, we've thought
about your proposal

01:09:02.305 --> 01:09:04.805
And we're willing to
take you up on it.

01:09:04.808 --> 01:09:09.444
Well, the case is more
complicated than I thought.

01:09:09.446 --> 01:09:11.345
So my price is going up.

01:09:11.348 --> 01:09:14.115
It's now fifty percent.

01:09:14.117 --> 01:09:16.283
Fifty percent?!

01:09:16.286 --> 01:09:17.385
That's almost half.

01:09:17.386 --> 01:09:19.854
You're a low-life,
opportunist!

01:09:19.856 --> 01:09:22.157
Yes.

01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:24.392
And I have a law
degree to prove it.

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:30.631
Set... Hike!

01:09:31.801 --> 01:09:34.202
Go long! Go long!

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:37.639
Touchdown! Whooo!

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:39.174
Nice catch!

01:09:43.013 --> 01:09:44.145
Hi.

01:09:44.147 --> 01:09:45.147
Hi.

01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:48.515
You remodeled.

01:09:48.518 --> 01:09:51.419
Yeah. We really love
how it turned out too.

01:09:51.421 --> 01:09:52.421
You do?

01:09:53.490 --> 01:09:55.323
Jack, we have a problem.

01:09:55.325 --> 01:09:56.591
Where's the tv?

01:09:56.593 --> 01:09:57.992
It's right in here.

01:09:58.828 --> 01:09:59.928
What's up?

01:09:59.930 --> 01:10:01.162
The local news.

01:10:01.164 --> 01:10:02.864
And you're not gonna like it.

01:10:02.866 --> 01:10:05.934
<i>Windsor's heirs claim their
uncle was mentally unstable</i>

01:10:05.936 --> 01:10:07.735
<i>At the time he wrote his will,</i>

01:10:07.737 --> 01:10:11.005
<i>Which made lucky the
richest dog in the world.</i>

01:10:11.007 --> 01:10:14.209
<i>Not only did he leave the
dog millions of dollars,</i>

01:10:14.211 --> 01:10:17.212
<i>But he appointed a dog
psychic as trustee.</i>

01:10:17.214 --> 01:10:19.080
<i>In our suit against the estate</i>

01:10:19.082 --> 01:10:21.416
<i>We allege that the dog
psychic, jack morgan,</i>

01:10:21.418 --> 01:10:24.052
<i>Is himself mentally incompetent</i>

01:10:24.054 --> 01:10:26.621
<i>And may have taken advantage of
the elderly mr. Windsor.</i>

01:10:26.623 --> 01:10:28.923
<i>Keep in mind that
this young man...</i>

01:10:28.925 --> 01:10:31.192
That's not true.

01:10:31.194 --> 01:10:32.860
<i>As a dog therapist,</i>

01:10:32.862 --> 01:10:36.197
<i>But also claims he can
read dogs' minds.</i>

01:10:36.199 --> 01:10:37.565
<i>That's right.</i>

01:10:37.567 --> 01:10:39.934
<i>He's either a con-man
or a lunatic.</i>

01:10:39.936 --> 01:10:41.603
<i>Hardly the type of individual</i>

01:10:41.605 --> 01:10:43.705
<i>Responsible enough to serve
as trustee for this estate.</i>

01:10:43.707 --> 01:10:44.707
Oh, boy.

01:10:45.442 --> 01:10:49.310
<i>Yeah... And... What he said.</i>

01:10:51.915 --> 01:10:53.715
<i>There you have it.</i>

01:10:53.717 --> 01:10:56.818
<i>One of the strangest cases
we've seen in a long time.</i>

01:10:56.820 --> 01:10:59.287
<i>A bitter battle that
can best be described</i>

01:10:59.289 --> 01:11:00.788
<i>As dog eat dog.</i>

01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:02.390
<i>Reporting live...</i>

01:11:02.392 --> 01:11:04.993
I didn't take advantage
of mr. Windsor.

01:11:04.995 --> 01:11:07.428
Relax, ok? I saw
this coming.

01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:08.896
Whenever there's this
much money involved

01:11:08.898 --> 01:11:10.498
There's always a dispute.

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:12.400
Well, what are we
supposed to do?

01:11:12.402 --> 01:11:14.235
We go to court.

01:11:14.237 --> 01:11:16.404
They say you're nuts
we say, prove it.

01:11:16.406 --> 01:11:18.106
Well, can they?

01:11:18.108 --> 01:11:19.874
Of course not.

01:11:21.645 --> 01:11:23.177
Well, not unless there's
something you're not
telling me.

01:11:23.179 --> 01:11:24.746
Is there?

01:11:24.748 --> 01:11:26.848
No.

01:11:26.850 --> 01:11:28.650
Are you sure?

01:11:30.353 --> 01:11:32.120
Because I'll fight
for you, jack,

01:11:32.122 --> 01:11:33.855
But you've got to
tell me everything

01:11:33.857 --> 01:11:35.023
Before we get to court.

01:11:36.993 --> 01:11:38.259
You know what I know.

01:11:39.929 --> 01:11:42.864
Ok. Bring 'em on.

01:11:42.866 --> 01:11:47.135
So I walk into his
office and there he
is, asleep.

01:11:47.137 --> 01:11:49.270
And where was your dog?

01:11:49.272 --> 01:11:51.606
Up on the desk
eating a sandwich.

01:11:51.608 --> 01:11:55.109
Mr. Mooney, why did
you and your wife

01:11:55.111 --> 01:11:56.611
Bring your dog to mr.
Morgan in the first place.

01:11:56.613 --> 01:11:59.981
Because he was eating too much.

01:12:03.953 --> 01:12:06.621
He and the dog were
digging in the dirt

01:12:06.623 --> 01:12:10.692
Looking for bones,
barking and howling.

01:12:10.694 --> 01:12:14.162
With him talking to the
dog like he understood
every word.

01:12:14.164 --> 01:12:15.563
Then what happened?

01:12:15.565 --> 01:12:19.534
You mean after he made
improper advances toward me?

01:12:19.536 --> 01:12:21.302
Yes.

01:12:21.304 --> 01:12:24.906
He chewed up the furniture,
tore apart the cushions,

01:12:24.908 --> 01:12:27.975
The pillow, everything.

01:12:27.977 --> 01:12:29.844
The dog did that?

01:12:29.846 --> 01:12:32.280
Both of them did that.

01:12:34.851 --> 01:12:36.484
When I got there,

01:12:36.486 --> 01:12:39.220
He was head first in
the garbage can.

01:12:39.222 --> 01:12:41.356
The dog too.

01:12:41.358 --> 01:12:47.261
And what was mr. Morgan
doing in the garbage can?

01:12:47.263 --> 01:12:50.331
I don't know, but when
I pulled him out

01:12:50.333 --> 01:12:51.733
He had a hotdog in his mouth.

01:12:56.439 --> 01:12:59.273
It's a simple question,
mr. Bridges.

01:12:59.275 --> 01:13:01.376
You live at the mansion.

01:13:01.378 --> 01:13:04.846
Surely you observe
mr. Morgan's conduct.

01:13:04.848 --> 01:13:06.214
I like to keep to myself.

01:13:06.216 --> 01:13:09.117
Are you saying you've
never seen jack morgan

01:13:09.119 --> 01:13:11.052
Exhibit unusual behavior?

01:13:11.054 --> 01:13:12.553
Depends on what you
mean by unusual.

01:13:12.555 --> 01:13:14.622
Very well.

01:13:14.624 --> 01:13:18.426
Would you describe mr.
Morgan as normal?

01:13:18.428 --> 01:13:21.095
There's all kinds of normal.

01:13:21.097 --> 01:13:23.097
Mr. Bridges,

01:13:23.099 --> 01:13:27.101
Have you seen jack
morgan act like a dog?

01:13:32.542 --> 01:13:34.776
I'm afraid you'll have
to answer the question.

01:13:34.778 --> 01:13:37.111
Ok.

01:13:37.113 --> 01:13:41.282
Yes, on occasion.

01:13:41.284 --> 01:13:44.152
Now we're getting somewhere.

01:13:44.154 --> 01:13:46.821
Details, mr. Bridges.

01:13:46.823 --> 01:13:49.791
Details.

01:13:49.793 --> 01:13:52.193
This could take some time.

01:13:53.463 --> 01:13:55.730
As a practicing dog therapist,

01:13:55.732 --> 01:13:58.266
You claimed you could
actually read dogs' minds.

01:13:58.268 --> 01:13:59.834
Isn't that correct?

01:13:59.836 --> 01:14:01.402
Yes.

01:14:01.404 --> 01:14:03.404
And when you made that
claim to your clients,

01:14:03.406 --> 01:14:04.972
Was it the truth?

01:14:07.844 --> 01:14:10.244
No.

01:14:10.246 --> 01:14:13.948
But when I was younger I
actually could read my
dog's mind.

01:14:13.950 --> 01:14:17.118
And for some reason I
can read lucky's mind.

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:19.086
Of course you can.

01:14:19.088 --> 01:14:20.988
With millions of dollars
in your control,

01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:22.957
Suddenly the old
power comes back.

01:14:22.959 --> 01:14:24.125
What a coincidence.

01:14:24.127 --> 01:14:25.293
Objection!

01:14:25.295 --> 01:14:28.296
Overruled, but move
it along, counselor.

01:14:28.298 --> 01:14:31.265
Let's get this straight.

01:14:31.267 --> 01:14:36.270
You were lying before but now
you're telling the truth, right?

01:14:36.272 --> 01:14:38.673
That's right.
I'm through lying.

01:14:38.675 --> 01:14:40.842
Let's be clear about this.

01:14:40.844 --> 01:14:44.111
You claim you can read
lucky's thoughts,

01:14:44.113 --> 01:14:46.113
Isn't that correct?

01:14:46.115 --> 01:14:48.149
That's right.

01:14:48.151 --> 01:14:52.053
That's very interesting.

01:14:52.055 --> 01:14:54.255
What's on his mind now?

01:15:01.965 --> 01:15:04.565
Your shoes.

01:15:04.567 --> 01:15:07.635
My shoes?

01:15:10.206 --> 01:15:12.306
Oh, yeah. He loves
to chew on leather.

01:15:12.308 --> 01:15:14.242
It's his favorite.

01:15:14.244 --> 01:15:16.177
Very clever.

01:15:16.179 --> 01:15:19.647
I'm sure you had lots
of clever answers

01:15:19.649 --> 01:15:20.848
For the elderly mr. Windsor

01:15:20.850 --> 01:15:22.683
When he came to you in ernest

01:15:22.685 --> 01:15:24.819
Believing you could
actually help him.

01:15:24.821 --> 01:15:26.020
Objection!

01:15:26.022 --> 01:15:27.388
Sustained.

01:15:27.390 --> 01:15:29.056
No more questions.

01:15:30.059 --> 01:15:32.493
You may step down, mr. Morgan.

01:15:36.599 --> 01:15:39.100
It was a harmless visit.

01:15:39.102 --> 01:15:41.602
I simply intended to reminisce,

01:15:41.604 --> 01:15:44.171
To have one last look,

01:15:44.173 --> 01:15:47.875
To feel the presence of
my dear departed uncle.

01:15:47.877 --> 01:15:51.445
And then... Then...

01:15:51.447 --> 01:15:56.517
That monster turned
violent and cruel.

01:15:56.519 --> 01:15:59.186
I can't go on!

01:16:01.357 --> 01:16:03.424
I know this is difficult.

01:16:05.562 --> 01:16:08.095
What did he do?

01:16:08.097 --> 01:16:10.598
He chased me off the property.

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:13.768
The home I once cherished.

01:16:13.770 --> 01:16:17.271
Galloping on all-fours,

01:16:17.273 --> 01:16:20.107
Howling like a beast.

01:16:20.109 --> 01:16:22.109
Then what?

01:16:22.111 --> 01:16:25.212
Then he attacked me.

01:16:25.214 --> 01:16:27.782
He attacked you?

01:16:27.784 --> 01:16:29.150
With his fists?

01:16:29.152 --> 01:16:30.818
No.

01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:32.787
How then?

01:16:32.789 --> 01:16:35.856
With this teeth!

01:16:40.129 --> 01:16:42.663
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:16:42.665 --> 01:16:46.300
I offer this torn and
tattered skirt to the court,

01:16:46.302 --> 01:16:49.270
Plain and simple evidence

01:16:49.272 --> 01:16:53.240
Of the true mental depravity

01:16:53.242 --> 01:16:58.846
Of mr. Jack morgan.

01:16:58.848 --> 01:17:00.481
Arf!

01:17:00.483 --> 01:17:02.249
Arf!

01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:07.588
So, when did you plan on
telling me about your
mental condition?

01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:09.123
It's not a mental condition.

01:17:09.125 --> 01:17:10.291
I'm your attorney, jack.

01:17:10.293 --> 01:17:12.259
You were supposed to
tell me everything.

01:17:12.261 --> 01:17:14.528
I didn't want you to
think I was crazy.

01:17:14.530 --> 01:17:16.430
Well, now I know you're crazy.

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:19.300
So, what do we do?

01:17:19.302 --> 01:17:21.035
We go back in that courtroom
and take our licks.

01:17:21.037 --> 01:17:22.503
You lose it all,

01:17:22.505 --> 01:17:24.171
And I move to a city

01:17:24.173 --> 01:17:25.773
Where they've never
heard about this case.

01:17:25.775 --> 01:17:27.341
Wait a minute, you're giving up?

01:17:27.343 --> 01:17:28.776
It's over, jack.

01:17:28.778 --> 01:17:30.945
The relatives get everything,

01:17:30.947 --> 01:17:32.713
Including lucky.

01:17:32.715 --> 01:17:33.914
What?

01:17:36.019 --> 01:17:37.019
No.

01:17:38.154 --> 01:17:39.954
No way.

01:17:39.956 --> 01:17:42.023
They can have the money
but they can't have lucky.

01:17:42.025 --> 01:17:44.358
It doesn't work that way, jack.

01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:47.561
Allison, I can't leave
lucky with those vultures.

01:17:47.563 --> 01:17:49.230
He won't last a week.

01:17:50.466 --> 01:17:52.133
Put me on the stand.

01:17:52.135 --> 01:17:53.834
I can prove I'm not crazy.

01:17:53.836 --> 01:17:55.236
How?

01:17:55.238 --> 01:17:57.471
There's something else I
haven't told you about yet.

01:17:57.473 --> 01:18:01.308
I can sort of channel lucky.

01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:02.476
I know it's weird but it's true.

01:18:02.478 --> 01:18:04.645
What are you talking about?

01:18:04.647 --> 01:18:08.149
Allison, the dog's voice
will come out of my mouth.

01:18:08.151 --> 01:18:09.417
You're kidding?

01:18:09.419 --> 01:18:10.918
I wish I was.

01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:12.253
Allison, you gotta believe me.

01:18:13.656 --> 01:18:15.256
What will he say?

01:18:22.665 --> 01:18:24.598
I don't have the slightest clue.

01:18:30.106 --> 01:18:31.839
Ms. Kent, will you call
your next witness?

01:18:31.841 --> 01:18:34.775
Your honor, with the
court's permission,

01:18:34.777 --> 01:18:36.777
We are prepared to
demonstrate conclusively

01:18:36.779 --> 01:18:39.080
That jack morgan can, in fact,

01:18:39.082 --> 01:18:40.414
Read lucky's mind.

01:18:42.285 --> 01:18:44.051
This oughta be interesting.

01:18:44.053 --> 01:18:46.287
This is a waste of the
court's time, your honor.

01:18:46.289 --> 01:18:47.855
Afraid of the truth,
mr. Phister?

01:18:47.857 --> 01:18:51.425
Ha ha, no,

01:18:51.427 --> 01:18:54.195
But you have failed to
produce one witness

01:18:54.197 --> 01:18:55.763
To support his claims.

01:18:55.765 --> 01:18:58.866
If you can bring one person
into this courtroom

01:18:58.868 --> 01:19:02.203
Who believes jack morgan
can read this dog's mind,

01:19:02.205 --> 01:19:04.839
I'll agree to a demonstration.

01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:13.214
I believe him, your honor.

01:19:13.216 --> 01:19:14.216
Do your stuff, pal.

01:19:15.785 --> 01:19:19.120
Jack, will you and lucky
please take the stand?

01:19:29.165 --> 01:19:31.732
All right, mr. Morgan,

01:19:31.734 --> 01:19:35.636
Please tell the court what
lucky is thinking right now.

01:19:43.346 --> 01:19:47.148
I...I'm not sure.

01:19:47.150 --> 01:19:49.116
Your honor...

01:19:49.118 --> 01:19:50.351
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:19:50.353 --> 01:19:52.453
Hey, hey, come on, boy.

01:19:52.455 --> 01:19:54.021
What's the problem? I'm
trying to save our tails.

01:19:54.023 --> 01:19:55.856
I know I told you not to
get over excited

01:19:55.858 --> 01:19:57.691
But now's your chance
to really let loose.

01:19:57.693 --> 01:19:59.627
Lucky, pay attention.

01:19:59.629 --> 01:20:02.496
I'm sorry, your honor.

01:20:02.498 --> 01:20:03.964
I need just another minute.

01:20:03.966 --> 01:20:06.467
He needs to get worked
up and emotional.

01:20:06.469 --> 01:20:09.170
I think we've seen
enough, your honor.

01:20:09.172 --> 01:20:12.973
This demonstration
proves just one thing.

01:20:12.975 --> 01:20:15.476
That jack morgan
will do anything

01:20:15.478 --> 01:20:18.279
To get his hands on
the inheritance.

01:20:18.281 --> 01:20:20.648
The windsor estate

01:20:20.650 --> 01:20:24.785
Rightfully belongs to
his blood relations,

01:20:24.787 --> 01:20:28.622
Not this ignorant dog.

01:20:28.624 --> 01:20:32.126
Jack morgan is a
phony and a fraud.

01:20:32.128 --> 01:20:35.296
No better than the
mindless beast

01:20:35.298 --> 01:20:37.064
He claims to communicate with.

01:20:37.066 --> 01:20:40.134
Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf!

01:20:40.136 --> 01:20:42.236
Arf! Arf! Arf!

01:20:51.514 --> 01:20:53.080
Calm down, calm down.

01:20:53.082 --> 01:20:54.815
It's ok, lucky. Relax.

01:20:54.817 --> 01:20:57.084
Calm down. Calm down, boy.

01:20:57.086 --> 01:21:00.054
Good boy, good boy.
Calm down.

01:21:01.057 --> 01:21:03.958
There you go.
All right now.

01:21:05.228 --> 01:21:08.329
Uuh. Uuh.
That's the spot.

01:21:08.331 --> 01:21:10.097
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Whoa, nelly.

01:21:10.099 --> 01:21:12.299
That's the spot.

01:21:15.204 --> 01:21:17.171
Ok, sit up. Sit up now.

01:21:17.173 --> 01:21:19.240
Come on. Sit up.

01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:23.644
Am I speaking to lucky now?

01:21:25.248 --> 01:21:26.614
In the fur.

01:21:26.616 --> 01:21:27.915
What's up?

01:21:27.917 --> 01:21:30.618
This is just an act.

01:21:30.620 --> 01:21:33.387
We'll just see.

01:21:33.389 --> 01:21:35.022
Please, face the jury.

01:21:43.432 --> 01:21:45.032
Choose an object,
mr. Phister.

01:21:45.034 --> 01:21:46.400
Show it to lucky

01:21:46.402 --> 01:21:48.035
But do not let mr.
Morgan see it.

01:21:55.111 --> 01:21:57.077
What's this, lucky?

01:21:57.079 --> 01:21:59.446
Looks like a stolen hotel pen.

01:21:59.448 --> 01:22:02.216
Did you take the towels too?

01:22:04.153 --> 01:22:06.153
Nothing but a good guess.

01:22:06.155 --> 01:22:07.454
Try something else.

01:22:07.456 --> 01:22:09.290
You honor...
Do it.

01:22:14.463 --> 01:22:17.798
Oh, chocolate caramel nugget
with roasted peanuts.

01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:19.800
My favorite. I'm drolling.

01:22:19.802 --> 01:22:21.001
When's lunch, anyway?

01:22:25.241 --> 01:22:27.441
Extraordinary.

01:22:27.443 --> 01:22:28.642
This is outrag...

01:22:28.644 --> 01:22:29.777
What else can you
tell us, fella?

01:22:29.779 --> 01:22:33.113
I say we cut to the
chase here, judge.

01:22:33.115 --> 01:22:35.316
There's a very good reason

01:22:35.318 --> 01:22:38.585
Why my master, mr.
Windsor, cut those
three out of his will.

01:22:38.587 --> 01:22:40.287
They're pinheads.

01:22:40.289 --> 01:22:43.290
Oh, sure, they act like
they're purebreds,

01:22:43.292 --> 01:22:44.492
But the truth of the matter is,

01:22:44.493 --> 01:22:46.026
They're the runts of the litter.

01:22:46.028 --> 01:22:49.763
Mr. Windsor knew that jack had
something extra going for him.

01:22:49.765 --> 01:22:52.366
And with my help he's
starting to learn

01:22:52.368 --> 01:22:53.801
How to get the best out of life.

01:22:53.803 --> 01:22:56.136
Jack's not crazy.

01:22:56.138 --> 01:22:58.172
A little boring, maybe,

01:22:58.174 --> 01:22:59.840
But most two-leggers are.

01:22:59.842 --> 01:23:01.608
I don't know,

01:23:01.610 --> 01:23:04.111
Maybe you've got to have a
lifespan as short as mine

01:23:04.113 --> 01:23:05.446
To get this,

01:23:05.448 --> 01:23:07.815
But you've got to enjoy
every minute of your life.

01:23:07.817 --> 01:23:10.284
It's the simple things
that matter.

01:23:10.286 --> 01:23:13.120
The sweet song of a can opener,

01:23:13.122 --> 01:23:15.789
Those precious moments when
you catch your own tail.

01:23:15.791 --> 01:23:19.126
Enjoy 'em while you can,

01:23:19.128 --> 01:23:20.861
Because you could run out
into the street

01:23:20.863 --> 01:23:22.730
Get hit by a bus at any minute,

01:23:22.732 --> 01:23:25.432
And boom, lights out.

01:23:39.248 --> 01:23:42.816
Lucky, are you ok?

01:24:06.776 --> 01:24:09.009
Not tonight, lucky.

01:24:09.011 --> 01:24:11.512
It's the coldest
night of the year.

01:24:13.182 --> 01:24:17.351
Ah, you know just how to
get to me, don't you, boy?

01:24:22.925 --> 01:24:24.758
All right, all right, come on.

01:24:26.729 --> 01:24:29.163
You'll be ok on your own.

01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:46.880
Jack?

01:24:46.882 --> 01:24:50.017
Jack? Jack!

01:24:51.287 --> 01:24:52.519
Jack!

01:24:54.723 --> 01:24:56.523
What did you do
with the cup, lyle?

01:24:58.894 --> 01:25:02.096
Huh? Lucky doesn't know
what you put in that
cup, but I do.

01:25:02.098 --> 01:25:05.499
You poisoned the old man,
didn't you? It was murder.

01:25:05.501 --> 01:25:07.167
You killed your uncle.

01:25:07.169 --> 01:25:08.402
Arf!

01:25:11.507 --> 01:25:12.773
Put the gun down!

01:25:12.775 --> 01:25:14.475
Put it down!

01:25:14.477 --> 01:25:16.510
Everybody freeze.
Put the gun down.

01:25:16.512 --> 01:25:18.679
Put it down.

01:25:18.681 --> 01:25:20.681
Come on, let's go.

01:25:36.499 --> 01:25:37.865
Lucky!

01:25:40.503 --> 01:25:43.437
What on earth were
you thinking of?

01:25:43.439 --> 01:25:46.039
Well, if it'd worked you
wouldn't be complaining.

01:25:47.343 --> 01:25:49.276
Come on, lucky.

01:25:49.278 --> 01:25:51.612
Hey, buddy, hang in there.

01:25:51.614 --> 01:25:53.046
I need you as much as
you need me.

01:25:54.316 --> 01:25:55.849
Lucky...

01:25:58.521 --> 01:25:59.720
Look, he's fine!

01:25:59.722 --> 01:26:01.688
The bullet just grazed his ear.

01:26:01.690 --> 01:26:03.457
Oow!

01:26:13.702 --> 01:26:16.303
Ok, so what's the big surprise?

01:26:16.305 --> 01:26:18.739
Be patient, be patient.

01:26:18.741 --> 01:26:21.475
Mommy, look. Jack bought
me the puppy I wanted.

01:26:21.477 --> 01:26:24.044
We're gonna keep him
here at lucky's house.

01:26:24.046 --> 01:26:26.079
How cute!

01:26:26.081 --> 01:26:28.015
It really wasn't necessary.

01:26:28.017 --> 01:26:30.017
I know, but, like you said,

01:26:30.019 --> 01:26:33.086
You want nicole to feel like
she's part of a big family,

01:26:33.088 --> 01:26:36.690
And, well, I was hoping
that maybe you do too.

01:26:36.692 --> 01:26:39.893
We're here for you, allison.

01:26:39.895 --> 01:26:42.162
All of us.

01:26:46.835 --> 01:26:52.105
Lucky finally realized
all the dogs at the pet
shop were for sale,

01:26:52.107 --> 01:26:54.608
Just what we need, more dogs.

01:26:54.610 --> 01:26:57.544
Well, pal, you got
everything you ever wanted.

01:26:57.546 --> 01:26:58.779
I guess the old man knew
what he was doing

01:26:58.781 --> 01:26:59.781
When he named you lucky.

01:26:59.782 --> 01:27:00.782
Arf! Arf!

01:27:00.783 --> 01:27:03.283
Yeah, I guess I'm lucky too.

01:27:03.285 --> 01:27:05.352
 Togetherness 

01:27:05.354 --> 01:27:07.020
 I know it sounds funny 

01:27:07.022 --> 01:27:11.425
 but we're lucky
as lucky can be 

01:27:11.427 --> 01:27:13.360
 togetherness 

01:27:13.362 --> 01:27:15.195
 you're always on the money 

01:27:15.197 --> 01:27:19.633
 'cause you know you
got a buddy in me 

01:27:19.635 --> 01:27:23.737
 no matter what
they do or say 

01:27:23.739 --> 01:27:27.908
 we'll never be alone 

01:27:27.910 --> 01:27:31.745
 'cause what we got
is here to stay 

01:27:31.747 --> 01:27:36.116
 and we're lucky right
down to the bone 

01:27:36.118 --> 01:27:38.118
 togetherness 

01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:39.886
 the two of us forever 

01:27:39.888 --> 01:27:44.291
 we're together right
till the end 

01:27:44.293 --> 01:27:46.326
 the very best 

01:27:46.328 --> 01:27:48.128
 there's nothing better 

01:27:48.130 --> 01:27:52.466
 than to know you've
found a friend 

01:27:52.468 --> 01:27:54.301
 'cause I've got you 

01:27:54.303 --> 01:27:56.503
 and you've got me 

01:27:56.505 --> 01:28:00.741
 there's no better
place to be 

01:28:00.743 --> 01:28:04.811
 we'll always have the
best and nothing less
