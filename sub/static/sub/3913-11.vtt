00:06.065 --> 00:07.569
This is our family.

00:07.603 --> 00:10.572
Once we have repowered our ship,
we will wake them up.

00:10.606 --> 00:13.542
We will conquer the Earth
and enslave you all.

00:13.576 --> 00:15.625
We will feed upon your delicate flesh

00:15.645 --> 00:17.968
in a glorious dread harvest.

00:17.988 --> 00:19.414
Stay close to your wife.

00:19.449 --> 00:21.516
Keep a weapon close at hand and guard her.

00:21.551 --> 00:23.985
From who? Your daughter?

00:24.020 --> 00:25.253
<i>I am searching for her.</i>

00:25.288 --> 00:27.322
I will come and tell
you when Stahma is safe.

00:35.765 --> 00:37.766
You're going to help me hunt.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.368
What is that?

00:39.402 --> 00:41.670
A control stem.

00:41.704 --> 00:44.324
It keeps you shape-takers obedient.

00:44.344 --> 00:47.776
[gasps, screams]

00:47.810 --> 00:49.133
She killed Tommy!

00:49.153 --> 00:51.380
A machine killed Tommy.

00:57.668 --> 00:59.452
You're scaring me.

01:00.134 --> 01:02.038
Don't! Down.

01:02.058 --> 01:03.463
[shouts]

01:03.497 --> 01:05.376
Nolan was delusional.

01:05.397 --> 01:07.167
He has our tech in his brain.

01:07.201 --> 01:09.439
You gonna let them take
me to South America?

01:09.459 --> 01:10.803
Don't want to.

01:10.838 --> 01:12.495
You need to.

If anyone was gonna survive
something like this,

Berlin!

03:30.038 --> 03:31.177
[exhales deeply]

03:31.212 --> 03:33.680
It's pretty ugly out there.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.148
There's a lot of bodies and blood,

03:35.182 --> 03:37.550
but I didn't see Nolan.

03:37.585 --> 03:38.885
<i>Do you have any idea what happened to him?</i>

03:38.919 --> 03:41.087
Someone took him, but he's alive.

03:41.121 --> 03:42.889
I can feel him.

03:42.923 --> 03:46.392
- You can feel him?
- In my head.

03:46.427 --> 03:47.994
Okay. Hang on.

03:49.430 --> 03:50.863
When I say go,

03:50.898 --> 03:53.600
you squirm out as fast as you can, got it?

03:53.634 --> 03:55.535
Do it.

03:55.569 --> 03:56.970
Go!

03:57.004 --> 03:59.305
[grunting]

04:06.212 --> 04:08.368
What are you doing out in the Badlands?

04:08.388 --> 04:10.649
I was headed back to Defiance.

04:10.669 --> 04:12.886
I heard about Nolan shooting
the vice-chancellor,

04:12.920 --> 04:15.955
<i>and I thought Amanda could use my help.</i>

04:15.990 --> 04:17.423
Is it true?

04:17.458 --> 04:18.690
<i>Did he shoot her?</i>

04:18.726 --> 04:20.392
He wasn't in his right mind.

04:20.428 --> 04:22.729
Oh. Runs in the family.

04:24.631 --> 04:26.958
There are three dead raiders out there.

04:26.978 --> 04:28.571
Was it an attack?

04:28.591 --> 04:30.637
I'm not sure.

04:31.906 --> 04:35.164
<i>The convoy was on the
road just a few hours,</i>

04:35.184 --> 04:37.723
<i>headed towards Brazil.</i>

04:37.743 --> 04:41.181
<i>Everything was quiet, and then...</i>

04:41.802 --> 04:43.883
Why the <i>chup</i> are we stopped?

_

04:57.431 --> 04:59.132
You still see him, don't you?

04:59.166 --> 05:00.867
Yep.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.302
Not for much longer, though.

05:02.336 --> 05:03.970
<i>And that's when it started.</i> [gunfire]

05:04.005 --> 05:05.205
Get down!

05:05.239 --> 05:07.474
- What is it?
- I don't know.

05:07.508 --> 05:10.644
[explosion]

05:27.928 --> 05:30.082
Nolan?

05:34.368 --> 05:36.442
[gasping]

05:38.606 --> 05:40.707
[breathing heavily]

05:40.741 --> 05:42.400
Nolan?

05:43.944 --> 05:45.312
Ian!

05:46.480 --> 05:48.548
Just like that, he was gone.

05:49.984 --> 05:51.971
Well, we'll find him.

05:53.987 --> 05:56.656
Thanks for not walking away.

05:57.756 --> 06:00.260
You mean not walking away again?

06:00.294 --> 06:01.528
Yeah.

06:01.562 --> 06:03.278
That's what I mean.

06:04.597 --> 06:06.799
You're welcome.

06:17.823 --> 06:19.657
He'll be here.

06:19.691 --> 06:21.359
It's been many hours.

06:21.393 --> 06:22.960
He promised to come when it's safe.

06:22.995 --> 06:24.528
Well, clearly it's not safe.

06:24.563 --> 06:25.963
It's possible T'evgin has decided

06:25.983 --> 06:28.603
he values the flesh
of his own flesh above yours.

06:28.623 --> 06:31.102
He would not betray me, not to her.

06:31.136 --> 06:33.738
Then perhaps Kindzi has killed him.

06:33.772 --> 06:36.348
We should ask her when she arrives,
which I imagine will be soon.

06:36.368 --> 06:37.899
You're trying to upset me.

06:37.919 --> 06:42.313
Yes, well, I'm bored.
I have to pass the time somehow.

06:46.852 --> 06:48.880
[exhales deeply]

06:49.655 --> 06:51.207
I do not love T'evgin.

06:51.227 --> 06:53.357
I don't recall asking if you did.

06:53.392 --> 06:55.593
But you wanted to.

06:55.627 --> 06:57.380
It's why you're acting so horrid.

06:57.400 --> 06:59.397
It's not an act.

07:03.440 --> 07:05.036
The Enchanter took me in,

07:05.070 --> 07:08.072
provided protection when I
was alone and frightened.

07:09.707 --> 07:11.976
He is decent,

07:12.010 --> 07:13.244
honorable.

07:13.264 --> 07:15.992
Since when do you find that attractive?

07:16.365 --> 07:19.684
T'evgin is worthy of my respect...

07:20.088 --> 07:22.987
my affection.

07:24.539 --> 07:26.657
But my heart...

07:28.061 --> 07:30.361
That is reserved for you...

07:35.218 --> 07:37.001
Always.

07:43.275 --> 07:45.476
It's your play, dear.

08:29.278 --> 08:32.280
[gasping]

08:37.899 --> 08:40.087
What have you done to me?

08:41.095 --> 08:43.591
You're stronger than any other Omec,

08:43.611 --> 08:45.793
stronger than me,

08:45.827 --> 08:48.796
strong enough to break these chains.

08:50.232 --> 08:54.468
Draining your blood keeps that
powerful body of yours occupied.

08:55.804 --> 08:58.939
It keeps you weak.

08:58.974 --> 09:01.909
You should just kill me.

09:01.943 --> 09:04.211
Kill you?

09:04.246 --> 09:06.247
No.

09:36.511 --> 09:38.727
It's the only motive that makes sense.

09:38.747 --> 09:41.148
How do you figure?

09:41.183 --> 09:44.685
Well, Nolan killed the vice-chancellor,
right?

09:44.720 --> 09:47.355
Raiders attack the caravan,
kidnap the assassin,

09:47.389 --> 09:50.758
and then sell him back to
the Votanis Collective.

09:50.792 --> 09:52.927
That's a dumb plan.

09:52.961 --> 09:54.428
[scoffs]

09:54.463 --> 09:58.032
Okay, if you don't like my theory,
give me another one.

10:01.371 --> 10:04.038
- Wait.
- What?

10:04.072 --> 10:07.052
These wounds... I've seen them before.

10:07.476 --> 10:09.685
Looks like a bite mark.

10:09.705 --> 10:11.445
In Defiance, we had animal attacks

10:11.480 --> 10:13.514
that looked a lot like these.

10:13.548 --> 10:15.916
I have never heard of
raiders using animals.

10:15.951 --> 10:17.184
These bodies were planted.

10:17.219 --> 10:18.953
By who?

10:18.987 --> 10:20.690
The Omec.

10:21.690 --> 10:24.191
Why would they do that?

10:24.226 --> 10:25.809
I don't know.

10:27.329 --> 10:29.299
<i>How is he?</i>

10:29.698 --> 10:31.565
Sedated.

10:31.600 --> 10:34.368
He'll be fine once the meds wear off.

10:35.120 --> 10:37.037
What about the hardware in his head?

10:37.072 --> 10:40.307
- You mean the arktech?
- It's a pollutant. I want it out.

10:40.342 --> 10:42.276
Removing it could kill him.

10:42.310 --> 10:44.245
Are you disobeying a command?

10:44.279 --> 10:47.515
Well, that's not really an option,
now, is it?

10:51.132 --> 10:52.319
Why did you attack that caravan?

10:52.354 --> 10:54.152
I mean, why bring him back here?

10:54.172 --> 10:58.154
I have chosen this human as my <i>hiakim,</i>
my pet.

10:58.174 --> 10:59.185
Why him?

10:59.205 --> 11:04.432
Look at him... such noble bearing...
so proud.

11:04.466 --> 11:06.534
I find him quite beautiful, don't you?

11:06.568 --> 11:09.203
Not really my gender.

11:11.206 --> 11:14.208
He was kind to me when
the human mayor shot me.

11:14.242 --> 11:15.743
He gave me a coat for warmth.

11:15.777 --> 11:17.445
I cannot allow the Votanis Collective

11:17.479 --> 11:18.779
to take him and kill him.

11:18.814 --> 11:19.914
But you're fine

11:19.948 --> 11:21.515
if I kill him on this
operating table right now?

11:21.550 --> 11:23.584
He is no good to me broken.

11:24.886 --> 11:27.354
May I speak freely?

11:27.389 --> 11:29.423
What?

11:29.458 --> 11:31.759
I think it's you that's broken.

11:32.627 --> 11:35.629
I don't know if it's a result of a trauma

11:35.664 --> 11:37.731
or if you're just a born sociopath,

11:37.766 --> 11:40.681
but there's a screw loose
in that head of yours.

11:41.006 --> 11:43.871
And you know I have a higher tolerance

11:43.905 --> 11:47.308
for cruelty than most folks, but...

11:47.342 --> 11:50.144
what you did to your father...

11:50.360 --> 11:52.537
it's sick.

11:53.348 --> 11:57.651
You make me sick, and that's the truth.

11:57.686 --> 11:59.386
Get out.

12:00.526 --> 12:02.756
You need me to do the surgery.

12:02.791 --> 12:04.425
I will do it myself.

12:04.459 --> 12:06.927
Go back to Defiance and
continue your collecting.

12:06.962 --> 12:08.762
You don't know what you're doing.

12:08.797 --> 12:10.297
Now.

12:13.032 --> 12:15.135
Yes, boss.

12:15.979 --> 12:18.197
Whatever you say.

12:19.474 --> 12:21.542
Good-bye, Nolan.

Something's happened.

13:22.779 --> 13:25.339
Tell me about it.

13:25.373 --> 13:27.274
No.

13:27.454 --> 13:30.122
No, I can't feel Nolan anymore.

He's gone.

13:45.899 --> 13:47.566
Hi.

13:50.950 --> 13:53.005
Kindzi?

13:54.174 --> 13:56.944
Here, drink.

13:57.415 --> 13:58.842
Mm. [grunts]

14:02.615 --> 14:04.079
Mm.

14:08.174 --> 14:09.188
Where's Irisa?

14:09.222 --> 14:12.124
Back in Defiance...

14:12.158 --> 14:16.161
telling everyone you were
killed in a raider attack.

14:16.310 --> 14:17.396
The night you were locked up,

14:17.430 --> 14:20.432
Irisa came to my father in tears.

14:20.467 --> 14:23.902
She begged us to help her rescue you.

14:23.937 --> 14:26.270
Together, we came up with a plan.

14:26.530 --> 14:27.739
So, the attack was...

14:27.774 --> 14:30.501
A necessary deception.

14:31.320 --> 14:34.880
Was... was anyone killed?

14:34.914 --> 14:36.748
Don't blame your daughter for that.

14:36.783 --> 14:38.124
Blame me.

14:38.319 --> 14:39.685
Oh, no.

14:39.719 --> 14:41.753
The Votanis Collective murdered our people.

14:41.788 --> 14:43.822
I will not apologize for killing them.

14:43.857 --> 14:47.426
No, it's okay. That's f... fair enough.

14:47.460 --> 14:50.329
I've done worse myself.

14:52.065 --> 14:53.599
So is there a plan?

14:53.633 --> 14:55.868
You and I will travel to Rancor Flats.

14:55.902 --> 14:56.863
And Irisa?

14:56.883 --> 14:59.137
Irisa will join us once she's satisfied

14:59.172 --> 15:02.508
the Votanis Collective believes her story.

15:02.542 --> 15:04.576
Okay, so...

15:04.611 --> 15:08.313
the raiders are blamed for
the attack on the convoy,

15:08.348 --> 15:11.316
Defiance is safe...

15:11.351 --> 15:12.819
a manageable plan.

15:12.839 --> 15:15.554
What did you do to me?

15:15.588 --> 15:17.389
I removed the metal from your head.

15:17.423 --> 15:19.324
No.

15:19.524 --> 15:21.994
No, Doc tried that.
She said it couldn't be done.

15:22.028 --> 15:25.063
I am Omec. Nothing is impossible.

15:26.958 --> 15:28.834
What about Irisa?

15:28.868 --> 15:30.836
Was she okay when you took the arktech out?

15:30.870 --> 15:32.977
Yes, as are you.

15:35.539 --> 15:38.114
You took a big risk for us.

15:38.511 --> 15:40.177
Thank you.

15:41.573 --> 15:43.977
May I ask why?

15:44.551 --> 15:48.954
We hate the Votanis
Collective as much as you do.

15:48.988 --> 15:51.290
Now relax.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.625
[grunts]

15:53.660 --> 15:56.773
There's nothing more to worry about.

15:57.030 --> 15:58.897
You're safe.

15:58.932 --> 16:00.966
You're healthy.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.796
And you're free.

16:02.816 --> 16:05.871
- For now.
- Shh.

16:05.905 --> 16:08.621
You've been fighting for
everyone else for so long,

16:08.641 --> 16:11.577
taking care of everyone but yourself.

16:11.611 --> 16:14.846
Now let someone else take care of you.

17:13.172 --> 17:17.142
I like how you shot that
Castithan politician.

17:17.175 --> 17:20.112
It reminded me of my father,

17:20.146 --> 17:21.680
how he used to be...

17:21.714 --> 17:26.151
dangerous, strong, brutal.

17:26.185 --> 17:28.487
Well, for the record,
I'm not proud of myself

17:28.521 --> 17:30.155
for shooting the vice-chancellor.

17:30.189 --> 17:33.058
I wasn't myself.

17:33.092 --> 17:34.802
Oh?

17:35.528 --> 17:38.697
The arktech in my head made me delusional.

17:38.731 --> 17:41.366
What kind of delusions?

17:44.504 --> 17:46.004
Uh...

17:46.039 --> 17:47.839
I saw myself...

17:47.874 --> 17:49.775
outside myself...

17:49.809 --> 17:52.110
as a soldier,

17:52.145 --> 17:55.180
and all I knew was killing.

17:55.214 --> 17:57.649
A shadow of yourself.

17:58.271 --> 18:01.730
_

18:02.257 --> 18:03.455
Our warrior echo.

18:03.489 --> 18:06.725
This happen to you people so much,
you have a name for it?

18:06.759 --> 18:09.127
It's a feeling, an instinct.

18:09.162 --> 18:11.797
How when everything in
your head tells you no,

18:11.831 --> 18:14.299
your <i> t'ovik nilusii</i> says yes.

18:14.333 --> 18:15.667
And was it your warrior echo

18:15.702 --> 18:20.472
that told you to kill all
those Votans in the raid?

18:20.506 --> 18:22.708
- You're judging me.
- No, no, no.

18:22.742 --> 18:25.610
I'm just concerned about Irisa.

18:25.645 --> 18:28.413
She must have been upset when
you started dropping bodies.

18:28.448 --> 18:30.115
Yes, at first.

18:30.149 --> 18:33.185
And then she understood the necessity.

18:35.033 --> 18:37.344
Yeah, well...

18:38.024 --> 18:40.158
kid's nothing if not practical.

18:40.193 --> 18:42.047
[chuckles]

18:42.962 --> 18:46.832
Hey, uh, I'd love to talk to her.

18:46.866 --> 18:50.067
You got a hailer here?

18:50.238 --> 18:53.038
The drones disrupt the hailer signal.

18:53.072 --> 18:54.606
You can talk to her later.

18:54.640 --> 18:57.976
Yeah, when we get to Rancor Flats,
you told me.

18:58.010 --> 19:01.487
Irisa puts her love for
you above anything else.

19:01.814 --> 19:04.816
She is a good daughter.
You should be proud of her.

19:04.851 --> 19:06.793
I am.

19:07.153 --> 19:08.854
I'm starving.

19:08.888 --> 19:10.255
I know how to make pancakes.

19:10.289 --> 19:12.610
No, no, no. I got this. I do.

19:15.995 --> 19:17.963
<i>You sure you don't want anything?</i>

19:17.997 --> 19:19.003
Nope.

19:19.023 --> 19:21.600
<i>I make a mean grilled cheese sandwich.</i>

19:21.634 --> 19:22.768
[chuckles]

19:22.802 --> 19:25.804
The trick is to butter both of the bread.

19:25.838 --> 19:26.972
Ugh!

19:27.006 --> 19:30.008
_

19:33.054 --> 19:34.988
I will return soon.

19:34.990 --> 19:37.655
I want two of you stationed on the roof,
two at the front door,

19:37.675 --> 19:39.795
and two with my wife at all times.

19:39.815 --> 19:42.122
Protect her with your life, if necessary.

19:42.142 --> 19:43.693
[chuckles]

19:45.394 --> 19:48.388
Have I said something
particularly entertaining?

19:48.605 --> 19:50.886
Look, Vizu,

19:50.906 --> 19:53.072
your money's good enough
for me to stand out front

19:53.074 --> 19:55.074
with a big gun to scare people away,

19:55.076 --> 19:57.773
but if <i> shtak</i> gets serious...

19:58.618 --> 20:01.111
No way I'm dying for a
house full of traitors.

20:01.131 --> 20:03.671
We know who killed Raiga and
the rest of your old crew.

20:03.691 --> 20:08.021
Can't prove it, but it was you, boss.

20:08.223 --> 20:09.956
How about it?

20:09.958 --> 20:12.111
You want us to leave?

20:12.131 --> 20:13.793
If and when the time comes,

20:13.795 --> 20:15.803
I am confident you will do the right thing.

20:15.823 --> 20:17.431
If you do not,

20:17.451 --> 20:21.371
this conversation will
continue and conclude.

20:23.970 --> 20:26.539
Take your posts.

20:35.169 --> 20:36.747
You cannot leave us with them.

20:36.767 --> 20:38.751
Doc Yewll isn't answering her hailer.

20:38.753 --> 20:40.253
I have to go find her.

20:40.255 --> 20:41.129
But T'evgin...

20:41.149 --> 20:43.471
For all we know T'evgin
is on his daughters side

20:43.491 --> 20:45.767
and he's damn near impossible to kill,
remember?

20:45.787 --> 20:50.677
If anyone knows how to kill a mature Omec,
it's Yewll.

20:50.697 --> 20:53.267
These men will betray us
the first chance they get.

20:53.287 --> 20:55.640
They're the best I could pull together.

20:55.660 --> 20:57.808
We're not exactly popular these days.

20:57.828 --> 20:59.875
Give me a gun.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.104
Don't be ridiculous.

21:04.106 --> 21:06.940
I'll fight for you, Favi...

21:06.942 --> 21:09.276
die defending you, if necessary.

21:15.836 --> 21:18.018
Safety's on the side.

21:25.565 --> 21:27.799
I'll be back soon.

21:29.676 --> 21:31.698
Look after her.

21:35.293 --> 21:37.512
[grunting]

21:44.979 --> 21:47.581
Where are we?
[sniffs]

21:47.583 --> 21:49.244
Old St. Louis?

21:49.264 --> 21:50.952
Someplace private.

21:50.972 --> 21:52.856
Where's Irisa?

21:52.876 --> 21:54.593
For real this time.

21:54.613 --> 21:57.159
Back at the convoy,
pinned under some metal.

21:57.407 --> 21:59.593
If she's not dead, she will be soon.

21:59.595 --> 22:01.094
[grunting]

22:01.390 --> 22:03.230
Does that information upset you?

22:03.232 --> 22:04.464
Yeah.

22:04.466 --> 22:07.267
Good, because you've upset me.

22:07.269 --> 22:08.568
[chuckles]

22:08.570 --> 22:11.271
Wh 'Cause I don't like being lied to?

22:11.273 --> 22:13.480
'Cause I don't want to be lunch?

22:14.609 --> 22:15.943
[buttons clatter]

22:15.945 --> 22:17.311
[sniffs]

22:17.313 --> 22:20.614
I would have cared for you.

22:20.616 --> 22:22.683
During the Dread Harvest,

22:22.685 --> 22:25.285
you would have been protected and favored.

22:25.287 --> 22:28.288
[grunts, breathing heavily]

22:28.290 --> 22:31.959
You would have had the highest
ranking amongst the slaves...

22:31.961 --> 22:35.862
never going hungry,
never wanting for anything.

22:35.864 --> 22:39.900
It's a great story,
but it wouldn't have ended well.

22:40.267 --> 22:42.569
You would have lived out your life span

22:42.571 --> 22:44.870
and had an honorable death.

22:44.890 --> 22:47.074
But now?

22:47.076 --> 22:49.743
[chuckles]

22:49.745 --> 22:52.490
Now you're just food.

22:53.248 --> 22:55.148
[alarm sounding]

22:55.716 --> 22:58.477
What's that? We got company up above?

23:04.225 --> 23:06.026
If the Omec did take Nolan,

23:06.028 --> 23:09.162
they killed a lot of people doing it.

23:09.422 --> 23:11.889
Hello, Nolan's daughter.

23:11.909 --> 23:13.767
Lawkeeper.

23:13.964 --> 23:16.870
We know you attacked the convoy
and tried to pin it on raiders.

23:16.872 --> 23:18.414
Are you here to arrest me?

23:18.434 --> 23:20.741
I just want Nolan.

23:21.007 --> 23:23.614
- I imagine he's with my father.
- Where?

23:23.634 --> 23:26.933
Out in the Badlands somewhere,
escaping Votan justice.

23:26.953 --> 23:29.260
Are you saying T'evgin attacked the convoy?

23:29.280 --> 23:32.719
The Votanis Collective
slaughtered our people.

23:32.721 --> 23:34.755
When Nolan killed their vice-chancellor,

23:34.757 --> 23:36.556
it pleased my father.

23:36.558 --> 23:38.591
<i>He took it upon himself to rescue Nolan</i>

23:38.611 --> 23:41.028
from our common enemy.

23:41.030 --> 23:43.463
My father has a soft spot
for the lesser races,

23:43.465 --> 23:46.867
but I still think you're animals.

23:48.146 --> 23:51.204
You don't believe what I'm saying,
have a look around.

23:52.889 --> 23:54.417
We will.

24:04.399 --> 24:07.219
[Nolan grunting, metal rattling]

24:16.929 --> 24:18.621
Ugh!

24:34.798 --> 24:37.812
<i>I've searched the roof and
the adjacent buildings.</i>

24:37.832 --> 24:40.482
<i>- Any luck in the mines?
- No.</i>

24:40.502 --> 24:43.629
Those tunnels go on forever.
It'll take days to search them all.

24:43.649 --> 24:45.478
We don't have that kind of time.

24:45.498 --> 24:46.858
Do you have a hailer?

24:46.860 --> 24:48.727
No.

24:48.729 --> 24:50.962
Mine isn't working.

24:53.001 --> 24:56.339
We need to warn Amanda that
the V.C. convoy was hit.

24:56.359 --> 24:58.737
I'm not leaving.

24:58.739 --> 25:02.251
Did you ever consider
that Kindzi might be telling the truth?

25:02.271 --> 25:04.150
I don't trust her.

25:04.170 --> 25:06.093
Me neither.

25:07.099 --> 25:10.148
Doesn't necessarily mean she's lying.

25:31.832 --> 25:34.283
Lawkeeper...

25:36.268 --> 25:38.396
Help me.

25:45.392 --> 25:48.443
What kind of freak show you
people building down here?

25:48.463 --> 25:51.069
It's my daughter's doing.

25:51.089 --> 25:52.930
What's her endgame?

25:52.950 --> 25:54.752
War.

25:54.936 --> 25:57.464
<i>It's what I promised her.</i>

26:00.192 --> 26:03.127
When the Votanis Collective
destroyed our fleet,

26:03.161 --> 26:05.357
Kindzi and I were lost.

26:05.377 --> 26:08.881
We knew the shape-takers
had found a suitable planet to colonize.

26:08.901 --> 26:12.637
We just didn't know where it was.

26:13.313 --> 26:16.442
We drifted aimlessly through space,

26:16.462 --> 26:18.494
searching for any signal that would lead us

26:18.514 --> 26:22.346
to the Votan arks or their destination.

26:23.024 --> 26:24.555
Earth.

26:24.575 --> 26:27.543
We didn't know to call it that, but, yes.

26:33.049 --> 26:35.190
[gasps]

26:37.781 --> 26:39.881
<i>Throughout the long journey,</i>

26:39.901 --> 26:42.600
hate kept me alive...

26:42.634 --> 26:43.991
focused.

26:44.011 --> 26:47.705
Kindzi learned hatred from watching me.

26:47.739 --> 26:50.541
I taught it to my daughter.

26:52.399 --> 26:56.947
Fantasies of revenge
told as bedtime stories

26:56.982 --> 27:01.152
night after night, year after year.

27:01.395 --> 27:04.158
Probably kept her going, right?
Kept her alive?

27:04.178 --> 27:05.958
But at what cost?

27:05.978 --> 27:08.526
There's always a trade-off, isn't there?

27:08.560 --> 27:11.447
I'm afraid I've been a bad father.

27:12.052 --> 27:14.394
[chuckles] Not alone there, pal.

27:16.635 --> 27:19.170
Take these back to your post.

27:27.330 --> 27:29.218
You're very talented.

27:29.238 --> 27:30.815
Thank you.

27:33.147 --> 27:35.334
Do you weave?

27:35.582 --> 27:38.005
I've never really tried.

27:38.623 --> 27:40.813
Sit beside me.

27:45.699 --> 27:49.600
For now,
just practice looping the thread...

27:50.092 --> 27:51.767
like this.

27:56.080 --> 27:57.988
I could make a bonnet for Luke.

27:58.008 --> 27:59.989
Aren't you ambitious.

28:00.935 --> 28:03.814
How is the little one doing?

28:04.335 --> 28:06.450
He's crawling now,

28:06.485 --> 28:08.772
starting to talk.

28:09.625 --> 28:10.757
And Alak?

28:10.777 --> 28:12.723
He's so good with the baby,

28:12.743 --> 28:14.125
though he still struggles with the diapers.

28:14.159 --> 28:16.222
He doesn't put the pins in tightly enough.

28:16.242 --> 28:20.720
I've shown him over and over,
but he still doesn't learn.

28:20.953 --> 28:23.202
Perhaps he enjoys being taught.

28:23.222 --> 28:25.343
[chuckles]

28:27.825 --> 28:30.321
What is it, Andina?

28:31.592 --> 28:33.577
Speak your mind.

28:35.947 --> 28:39.083
I love spending this time together...

28:39.117 --> 28:43.254
feeling this close to you and your family,
but...

28:43.417 --> 28:45.558
I'm not stupid.

28:46.291 --> 28:48.659
I know it can't last.

28:49.156 --> 28:51.266
What can't last?

28:51.286 --> 28:53.430
Oh, you are <i>Shanje.</i>

28:53.465 --> 28:55.797
I'm a handmaiden.

28:55.817 --> 28:58.435
Soon enough, this crisis will pass,

28:58.470 --> 29:01.787
and everything will go back
to the way it used to be.

29:01.807 --> 29:03.974
It's just nature.

29:04.282 --> 29:07.111
It is possible to elevate
one's station through marriage.

29:07.145 --> 29:11.247
It's one of the more savory aspects
of our shared culture.

29:13.884 --> 29:16.351
Hold your hand like this.

29:18.824 --> 29:21.325
Hmm. Thank you.

29:22.527 --> 29:25.629
When Christie died...

29:25.664 --> 29:28.423
poor little Luke suffered
an unimaginable loss.

29:28.443 --> 29:30.801
You stepped in.

29:30.836 --> 29:33.185
You took care of him.

29:33.672 --> 29:35.139
I've done my best.

29:35.173 --> 29:37.115
I know.

29:37.828 --> 29:40.931
My son has needs too.

29:41.768 --> 29:43.956
What are you saying?

29:44.685 --> 29:47.999
Just idle talk with a trusted friend.

29:48.784 --> 29:52.656
[chuckles] Promise that will never change.

29:52.691 --> 29:56.827
I think, in time,
with me whispering in his ear,

29:56.862 --> 30:00.331
I might persuade Alak to forgive you.

30:00.365 --> 30:02.430
And the baby?

30:03.034 --> 30:05.563
I can bring him here in secret.

30:06.872 --> 30:09.348
That would be quite a kindness.

30:10.542 --> 30:13.844
And perhaps one day,

30:13.879 --> 30:17.095
when I've married into the <i> Shanje...</i>

30:18.383 --> 30:20.833
We can drink tea as equals.

30:24.222 --> 30:26.991
You have quite a knack for this.

30:28.376 --> 30:30.828
I'm impressed.

30:42.893 --> 30:44.754
[chuckles]

30:46.077 --> 30:49.480
Did Conrad Von Bach kick you to the curb?

30:49.514 --> 30:50.581
I came to help.

30:50.615 --> 30:52.349
Well, I don't need help,

30:52.384 --> 30:54.151
especially from you.

30:54.185 --> 30:56.096

30:57.772 --> 31:00.471
Nolan never made it to Brazil.

31:02.968 --> 31:04.161
Where's Irisa now?

31:04.195 --> 31:07.097
She stayed behind hoping
Kindzi would lead her to Nolan.

31:13.694 --> 31:15.567
What are you doing?

31:15.587 --> 31:16.839
I can't help you

31:16.859 --> 31:19.476

the hell you're doing.

[sighs] Protecting the town.

31:21.413 --> 31:22.913

31:22.948 --> 31:25.482
If Kindzi's fake raider attack
didn't fool you and Irisa,

31:25.517 --> 31:28.752
what makes you think
it's gonna fool the V.C.?

31:28.787 --> 31:30.187
Okay, good point.

31:30.221 --> 31:31.388
They'll start counting bodies

31:31.423 --> 31:33.624
and notice that Nolan
and Irisa are missing.

31:33.658 --> 31:35.504
- And blame Defiance.

31:35.524 --> 31:37.962
sympathetic to the Butcher of Yosemite.

31:37.996 --> 31:41.611
It'll give the V.C. hardliners
every reason to attack,

31:41.631 --> 31:43.233

31:43.268 --> 31:47.304
Nolan and Irisa die
tragically in the attack.

Hmm.

I've been looking for you everywhere.

32:01.486 --> 32:03.520
Well, I haven't been everywhere.

32:03.555 --> 32:06.156
I need to find the best
way to kill an Omec.

32:06.191 --> 32:08.036
I know the daughter can
be stopped by a bullet,

32:08.056 --> 32:11.885

T'evgin poses more of a...

32:12.275 --> 32:14.665

32:14.699 --> 32:17.582

- Died of what?

32:18.239 --> 32:21.267
A new strain of hemorrhagic fever.

32:23.290 --> 32:26.020
- Are Castithans...
- Everyone is susceptible,

32:26.040 --> 32:28.701
and believe me, this is one nasty bug.

32:28.721 --> 32:31.488
You die, bleeding from your eyes...

32:35.866 --> 32:37.302
If it spreads,

32:37.322 --> 32:40.792
the Omec will be the least of your worries.

32:40.793 --> 32:42.012
What's that?

32:42.046 --> 32:44.347
A vaccine.

32:44.382 --> 32:45.882
I don't have enough for everyone,

32:45.917 --> 32:48.218
so we need to keep this on the down-low.

32:48.252 --> 32:50.353
We can't afford a panic.

32:52.623 --> 32:55.058
Put your gun down, sweetie.

32:58.596 --> 33:01.198
Stahma will need a dose...

33:01.232 --> 33:03.867

33:03.901 --> 33:06.763
You make sure it gets...

33:09.907 --> 33:13.243
I'll get around to all of them eventually.

33:14.814 --> 33:17.113
The Omec will make sure of that.

33:22.546 --> 33:25.014
I would never have been
able to drag these corpses

33:25.048 --> 33:27.254

Conrad understands.

33:39.896 --> 33:41.877
I missed you.

33:42.917 --> 33:44.809
Same here.

33:51.991 --> 33:54.132
Now we're...

33:54.152 --> 33:56.712

We need reinforcements.

You underestimate me, daughter.

You have broken my heart.

Please, Father, forgive me.

I'll do whatever you say.

You will return to the sleep pod.
