08:05.160 --> 08:08.864
Do not forget it.

08:09.406 --> 08:12.237

08:12.337 --> 08:14.736

08:14.836 --> 08:16.864
How long have you known her?

08:16.964 --> 08:19.491
Since we were small.

08:19.591 --> 08:23.036
I hate her mother.
My Aunt Mary.

08:23.136 --> 08:25.706
She's a fucking stupid sow.

08:25.806 --> 08:27.624

She is my first cousin.

08:36.025 --> 08:38.065
And the sweetest I have.

08:39.937 --> 08:45.476
As I always say:
The closer the family, the closer.

08:45.576 --> 08:51.441
Should not we get hold of Tony Bennet
and go down and catch fireflies?

09:04.211 --> 09:06.463

09:19.309 --> 09:21.349
And I said: 'I am sku

09:21.449 --> 09:24.673
'... You damn right
careful when you open your car door.'

09:24.773 --> 09:29.561
It cost me $ 200 getting into shit.

09:29.661 --> 09:33.282
The car is a big wreck.

09:37.703 --> 09:40.864
Hey.

09:40.964 --> 09:44.418

You stupid motherfucker.

10:06.365 --> 10:11.153
Will have more to drink?
- Yes, thank you, Jenny.

10:16.200 --> 10:21.655
Wanna have a beer? My mother is asleep,
I know where she hides them.

10:21.755 --> 10:25.501
Sure.
- No thank you.

10:26.877 --> 10:31.248

since she met the 'bone', huh?

10:31.348 --> 10:32.040
'Bone'?

10:32.140 --> 10:35.502
Yes, it's Knight's nickname.
My family has known him for years.

10:35.602 --> 10:37.519
They call him 'bone' because
had to take bone from his leg..

10:37.619 --> 10:39.044
.. And replace it with a piece of metal.

10:39.144 --> 10:41.595
I've heard it's because
he is from Bone Creek Ridge.

10:41.695 --> 10:44.594
No, no, he has the piece of data
one of my mother's girlfriends...

10:44.694 --> 10:48.048
One night he made
trouble and the cops came.

10:48.148 --> 10:52.060
He beat by 4 policemen
so one had to shoot him in the leg.

10:52.160 --> 10:53.687
That's why he is lagging.

10:53.787 --> 10:56.273
Close ass Tony.
You're full of shit.

10:56.373 --> 10:59.776
But my mom...
- Your family is full of shit.

10:59.876 --> 11:03.739
Billy Martin.
Dim you there. </ I>.

11:03.839 --> 11:05.574
Yes mother.

11:05.674 --> 11:07.674
Well done idiot.

11:07.760 --> 11:11.455
And his cousin Rusty Knight,
him with the cool car.

11:11.555 --> 11:14.041
He beat a guy to death 2 years ago.

11:14.141 --> 11:18.460
How do you know all this?
- The family has known him for years.

11:18.560 --> 11:21.894
Rumour has it he went free because
he claimed it was self defense.

11:21.994 --> 11:23.751
What had this guy done to him?

11:23.851 --> 11:26.345
Rusty kept at a traffic light on July 4.

11:26.445 --> 11:29.515
A guy driving up beside him,
and his car scrapes against Rusty's..

11:29.615 --> 11:33.352
Rusty goes berserk and starts knocking
guy's head down in the car.

11:33.452 --> 11:36.230
The guy starts to scream.
- And what happens?

11:36.330 --> 11:39.566
Rusty pulls his pocket knife.

11:39.666 --> 11:43.829
And chopping him like a catfish.

11:49.084 --> 11:52.921
Then he throws him into the river.

11:55.966 --> 11:58.377
Here you go ahead.

11:58.477 --> 12:00.254
Klamt. It has touched your buns.
I do not drink it.

12:00.354 --> 12:03.807
Drink it now just you fat pig.

12:23.660 --> 12:26.538
Thank you.

12:35.714 --> 12:41.628
Hear sweet, you can only buy food
with coupons..

12:41.728 --> 12:44.681
Okay.
What about money?

12:50.103 --> 12:53.891
It's damn right cool.
What is it?

12:53.991 --> 12:57.769
I want to talk Mr. Tightwiler he
decide about 'The Haunted House'.

12:57.869 --> 13:00.522
I'll try to persuade him to
letting me make the monsters this year.

13:00.622 --> 13:03.775
He has always something bad cheap junk.

13:03.875 --> 13:06.320
If I can get some money
I'll show him what I can.

13:06.420 --> 13:09.823
I heard they wanted to cut it
this year because no one was last year.

13:09.923 --> 13:12.159
Yes, but I have worked on
some cool things I'll show him.

13:12.259 --> 13:13.827
Now we must see.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.496
Shut up you have balls.

13:15.596 --> 13:17.873
With all the saints fools around here...

13:17.973 --> 13:20.667
I'm afraid they'll think you're
satanic or anything like that.

13:20.767 --> 13:24.847
And burning crosses in
your backyard or the like.

14:52.564 --> 14:55.060
Thank you mom.

14:58.273 --> 15:01.276
A YEAR LATER.

15:05.781 --> 15:08.742

15:28.512 --> 15:32.099
Betsy Lue, are you okay?

15:39.481 --> 15:43.235
What there has been little darling?

15:44.903 --> 15:48.198

15:50.704 --> 15:52.895
Holy God..

15:59.543 --> 16:04.256
Lord Jesus.
Save me.

16:08.886 --> 16:10.704
Calm, quiet,
it's okay, calm.

16:10.804 --> 16:12.841
Betsy Lue tied to a rock behind my trailer.

16:12.941 --> 16:17.394
I've just made a model of her.

16:19.438 --> 16:22.642
What in the hot cave
hell is wrong with you?

16:22.742 --> 16:26.737
You're crazy.
You almost gave me a heart attack.

16:27.487 --> 16:31.359
It's fucking sick.

16:31.459 --> 16:33.459
But I must admit...

16:33.556 --> 16:39.658
I almost thought it was a
pig monster of a moment.

16:39.758 --> 16:43.579
This is a latex copy of Betsy.

16:43.679 --> 16:46.123
A huh?

16:46.223 --> 16:48.634
It's cheating.

16:50.761 --> 16:54.723
Can I make 'Ghost House'?

16:58.852 --> 17:02.306
So never mind then,
your creepy little freak.

17:02.406 --> 17:07.935
You got me. And you can
probably do better than me.

17:08.036 --> 17:11.690
But I have not very many
money to spend by the who...

17:11.790 --> 17:15.275
...Poliotex or what the hell you call it.

17:15.493 --> 17:19.115
You have approx. 250 Dollars
the entire house.

17:19.214 --> 17:21.959
Really?

17:24.377 --> 17:27.915
Thank you Mr. Tightwiler.
You'll not be disappointed.

17:28.015 --> 17:32.095
See, so to get away from here

17:32.151 --> 17:36.056
And came back with my right Betsy.

17:38.141 --> 17:41.937
And now, so to get started.

18:09.175 --> 18:09.993
What is happening?
- I ik.

18:10.093 --> 18:13.900
They pulled me out of
hours and sent me home.

18:14.315 --> 18:16.598
Me too.

18:24.271 --> 18:27.316
What the hell?

18:30.903 --> 18:33.989
What happened?

18:35.324 --> 18:38.735
Earl has done something bad.

18:38.835 --> 18:40.654
Has he hit you?

18:40.754 --> 18:44.750
Ham and Rusty had a few beers...

18:45.709 --> 18:50.756
We went outside and grilled...

18:53.675 --> 18:56.336
I walked in here...

18:56.436 --> 18:59.381
To wash up.

18:59.481 --> 19:03.352
Did I hear a terrible noise.

19:05.145 --> 19:08.265
When I looked outside...

19:08.365 --> 19:10.476
Earl...

19:10.576 --> 19:15.197
What did he do?

19:16.698 --> 19:21.361
Earl Rusty stuck with his pocket knife.

19:21.461 --> 19:25.707
You know the one I gave
him last Christmas.

19:29.419 --> 19:35.592
He was just keep put it in my legs on him.

19:37.261 --> 19:41.515
About and over again...

19:45.435 --> 19:49.182
Rusty
must have said something to piss him off.

19:49.282 --> 19:52.727
Earl began to kick his car
that was how it started.

19:52.827 --> 19:56.606
No, Mom. It started everyone was full.

19:56.706 --> 19:58.858
This is how it always starts.

19:58.958 --> 20:02.487
It's only a matter of time before
evil pig does something to you.

20:02.587 --> 20:05.657
And do not say I'm wrong.
He hear things we do not even say.

20:05.757 --> 20:11.086
His stiff imagination,
just fill the holes.

20:11.712 --> 20:14.623
He's in jail now.

20:14.723 --> 20:16.333
And the boys...

20:16.433 --> 20:19.636
..... He's not coming back.

20:20.387 --> 20:23.390
It's over.

20:37.946 --> 20:41.817
What the hell are you looking at boy?

20:41.917 --> 20:44.661
Nothing.

20:45.329 --> 20:48.332
I just think.

20:48.957 --> 20:54.080
You should think about to find a real job.

20:54.180 --> 20:59.127

20:59.227 --> 21:01.566

You'll sku no to anything by
students and do all the Halloween stuff.

21:12.323 --> 21:17.270
I know your mother gave you
money to paint and glue.

21:17.370 --> 21:20.315
Just as you know, this
is not Hollywood, you little fool.

21:20.415 --> 21:23.651
You better get going
to earn your own money.

21:23.751 --> 21:25.897
I'll pay you back.

21:25.997 --> 21:27.697

And I will earn some money...

21:30.043 --> 21:32.193

21:50.235 --> 21:53.388

application down to chicken inn.

21:57.451 --> 21:59.820

23:42.548 --> 23:43.415

23:43.515 --> 23:45.000
How are you?

23:45.100 --> 23:47.753
I know right? How are you?
What can I help you?

23:47.853 --> 23:51.763
Have you got anything new?
- Let us look again.

23:54.142 --> 23:56.512
What about 'Love is a Battlefield'?
- No, the horror.

23:56.612 --> 23:59.473
Do you have any horror stories?

23:59.573 --> 24:01.736
Science-fiction is fine.

24:01.836 --> 24:03.966
'Slaughter House 3'?
- No.

24:04.100 --> 24:06.323
'A handful of guts'?
- I have it.

24:06.423 --> 24:08.552
'Kill, kill, die, die'?
- I've seen it.

24:08.652 --> 24:10.642
'Happy birthday,
you're dead'?

24:10.742 --> 24:11.902
I have it.

24:12.002 --> 24:15.114
You are Green, right?
You create special effect makeup, right?

24:15.214 --> 24:16.907
How do you know?

24:17.007 --> 24:18.746
I went through the records,

24:18.846 --> 24:21.745
and I asked Mrs. Kenny,
whom this Green guy is...

24:21.845 --> 24:25.332
As had borrowed 'Devil Mountain'
six times, exactly..

24:25.432 --> 24:28.585
And then she told me about you.

24:28.685 --> 24:30.045
What about you?

24:30.145 --> 24:31.880
I Angevine.

24:31.980 --> 24:35.142
Angevine Duvet.

24:35.893 --> 24:39.555
I think it's really cool what you do.

24:39.655 --> 24:41.056
I'm an actor.

24:41.156 --> 24:43.600
I'm moving soon back to Hollywood.

24:43.700 --> 24:46.270
Have you been to Hollywood?

24:46.370 --> 24:49.606
Did you do some movies?

24:49.706 --> 24:50.858
Yes.

24:50.958 --> 24:52.656
A few B-movies..

24:52.756 --> 24:56.605
.. But I had to move back
to take care of my mother.

24:56.705 --> 24:58.032
Impressive.

24:58.132 --> 25:00.743
You know well enough your horror stories.

25:00.843 --> 25:03.872
Yes, I'm trying to see so many
as possible here in the store...

25:03.972 --> 25:06.541
My mom freak out if I take them home.

25:06.641 --> 25:07.834
Why?
It's just movies.

25:07.934 --> 25:12.297
She's fucking crazy.
My father has been missing for 10 years.

25:12.397 --> 25:17.248
But every night she ber
a prayer that God will bring him back.

25:17.348 --> 25:18.750
It's not the worst....

25:18.850 --> 25:23.394
She has this pillow
she has with him all the time...

25:23.494 --> 25:25.476
...As she pretends to have him.

25:25.576 --> 25:28.433
It's true.
She gives the tea and little kisses at night.

25:28.533 --> 25:29.786
One evening when I spied her..

25:29.886 --> 25:34.936
...She lay and whispered something
to the pad for more than five minutes.

25:35.036 --> 25:37.586
I'm sorry your father is dead.

25:37.672 --> 25:39.032
No he is not.

25:39.132 --> 25:43.627
He fucks one or
second stripper in Nashville.

25:45.379 --> 25:47.873
Have you resolved to...

25:47.973 --> 25:50.834
...To watch a movie maybe?
One day..?

25:50.934 --> 25:53.170
With me.

25:53.270 --> 25:54.713
How old are you?

25:54.813 --> 25:56.548
I'm 18th.

25:56.648 --> 25:59.259
Almost.

25:59.359 --> 26:00.886
Yes, thank you.

26:00.986 --> 26:03.889
It could be very cool.
In the meantime...

26:03.989 --> 26:05.476
What do you say to..

26:05.576 --> 26:09.231
.. The latest in the series of 'Friday 13'?

26:10.571 --> 26:14.149
It is a preview screen.

26:14.249 --> 26:17.161
Lots of corpses.

26:42.686 --> 26:45.397
Hello?

26:46.273 --> 26:49.735
Yes, of course,
Hello Monster-man.

26:51.945 --> 26:56.609
Mommy is singel meeting in the church.

26:56.709 --> 26:59.988
I can come over to you?

27:00.088 --> 27:03.123
Why not?

27:05.000 --> 27:09.129
It's just a lot to me.

27:09.713 --> 27:12.709
Yes, I know where it is.

27:12.809 --> 27:15.545
Okay, we'll see you there.

27:15.645 --> 27:17.930
Goodbye.

27:43.497 --> 27:45.032
Mongrola mask.

27:45.132 --> 27:47.659
The from 'Valley of the Dead - Del.3'.

27:47.759 --> 27:48.827
Beautiful.

27:48.927 --> 27:50.245
Nice try.

27:50.345 --> 27:51.121
How are you?

27:51.221 --> 27:52.499
Fine.

27:52.599 --> 27:54.731
Unfortunately, my mother
back soon from his singel meeting...

27:54.831 --> 27:56.951
And then I returned and 'fit' her..

27:57.051 --> 28:00.423
What is wrong with her?
If I may ask?

28:00.523 --> 28:04.677
She has something to do with the hip.
So she's stuck in a wheelchair.

28:04.777 --> 28:06.137
I'm sorry.

28:06.237 --> 28:09.690
It must be hard.

28:10.941 --> 28:14.938
Do you know the 'Haunted House' they
have here in town for Hallowen?

28:15.038 --> 28:17.038
Yes, of course.

28:17.124 --> 28:21.111
I have been allowed to
create monsters to it this year...

28:21.211 --> 28:24.155
I was rejected last year, but...

28:24.255 --> 28:28.076
I have talked with Mr. Tightwiler,
and showed him what I can...

28:28.176 --> 28:31.830
So I got the job try to see it here...

28:31.930 --> 28:34.124
Where is it just fat.

28:34.224 --> 28:37.669
Do you need any sweet
female actresses to be the monster?

28:37.769 --> 28:38.920
Mm yes..

28:39.020 --> 28:43.133
Do you think you are too overqualified
to have a mask on.

28:43.233 --> 28:45.233
But...

28:45.309 --> 28:48.304
Can you get me some of
the movies you were in?

28:48.404 --> 28:51.940
I really want to see them.

28:54.276 --> 28:56.440
They are in a box or a
somewhere in my closet...

28:56.540 --> 28:59.515
...But I'll see if I can find them.

29:00.699 --> 29:02.735
I will also be a 'movie star' in the morning.

29:02.835 --> 29:07.198
I on TV tomorrow and advertise 'house'.

29:07.298 --> 29:09.742
In today's 'Fear Field'?
How fat.

29:09.842 --> 29:13.371
Should I go with?
As support?

29:13.471 --> 29:16.798
Ham ' may be a big mouthful.

29:18.717 --> 29:23.715
I seem to get over the nervous
if you are there and look at me.

29:23.815 --> 29:26.425
But I get a percentage of ticket...
- Kissing you find me soon?

29:26.525 --> 29:30.103
For I must soon leave.

29:31.420 --> 29:36.581

29:36.681 --> 29:42.349
...is shown therein a receiving anything.

We agreed sooner to meet here...

29:44.002 --> 29:46.112
...and catching fireflies,
you may well remember?

29:46.212 --> 29:47.614
No.

29:47.714 --> 29:50.116
Who is the vampire chick?

29:50.216 --> 29:52.035
My name is Angevin.

29:52.135 --> 29:55.121
Billy Martin is my name,
but you can call me Dr. Flattery...

29:55.221 --> 29:58.333
For I am smigrerne, opposite the ladies.

29:58.433 --> 30:01.336
Yes, if they have family with you.

30:01.436 --> 30:02.629
What about you?

30:02.729 --> 30:05.298
I've never fucked my cousin, it's disgusting.

30:05.398 --> 30:06.508
Your Name?

30:06.608 --> 30:07.425
Tony Bennet.

30:07.525 --> 30:09.385
Just like the singer.

30:09.485 --> 30:11.763
Tony Bennett and Billy Martin.
Laver in shit with me?

30:11.863 --> 30:14.974
Let me take you home.

30:15.074 --> 30:19.397
Sexy bitches,

30:20.554 --> 30:22.709
...what about Green,

30:22.809 --> 30:24.849
How did you just a fool.

30:29.823 --> 30:33.326
Why did you

30:33.426 --> 30:37.122
The local special effects guy
Green Graves, is here to...

30:37.222 --> 30:42.602
...Talk about Sam's Tightwiler
'haunted house' this year.

30:42.844 --> 30:45.024
Well, uh, it'll be Friday night
on Halloween night.

30:45.124 --> 30:48.955
Graves, it is your real last name?
It's weird.

30:50.100 --> 30:51.100
.

30:51.200 --> 30:52.554
There will be plenty of cool
stuff this year... </ i>...

30:52.654 --> 30:55.714
...We have a Zombie Army... </ i>...

30:55.806 --> 30:59.716
Soon come Pattie Joe Ditts...
- Holy shit, man.

30:59.788 --> 31:02.522
Could not we just
stick to the 'ghost house'?

31:02.622 --> 31:06.317
Just a minute?
- Well, okay..

31:06.417 --> 31:09.279
Beware straight in with your
languages?? kid.

31:09.379 --> 31:10.864
I'm sorry.

31:10.964 --> 31:14.200

31:14.300 --> 31:16.081
Please come all together... </ i>.

31:16.181 --> 31:18.731
The boy goes straight to hell.

31:22.174 --> 31:26.086
What do you think would win,
if they were in combat?

31:26.186 --> 31:27.493
Probably goblin.

31:27.593 --> 31:32.523
He would take him in a headlock and
beat him with his club.

31:35.687 --> 31:37.876
What the hell is you say you little shit?

31:37.976 --> 31:39.577
I heard good shit.

31:39.677 --> 31:40.978
What do you Earl?
Jag said nothing.

31:41.078 --> 31:42.209
We talked just about comics.

31:42.309 --> 31:45.222
You will not fucking lie to me,
you little brat.

31:45.322 --> 31:48.067
I heard you well
as we drove past the church just before.

31:48.167 --> 31:51.738
Take my back to the church
so I can repent.

31:51.838 --> 31:53.448
This shit is not fucking funny.

31:53.548 --> 31:59.670
And how often should I tell you
that you can get some on your head, boy?

32:14.026 --> 32:16.218
And when repenting your sins... </ i>...

32:16.318 --> 32:18.319
...Accept our Lord Jesus Christ... </ i>...

32:18.419 --> 32:20.839
...as your personal savior... < / i>...

32:20.939 --> 32:26.301
...Personal revenge,
and financial advisor... </ i>...

32:26.401 --> 32:27.302
...Whenever you... </ i>.

32:27.402 --> 32:29.402
Mommy?

32:29.992 --> 32:32.320
You're at home?

32:32.420 --> 32:36.456
I decided to stay home tonight.

32:36.832 --> 32:39.332
Together with you, my dear.

32:40.837 --> 32:43.665
I'm going to the movies with a friend.

32:43.765 --> 32:45.765
Really?

32:45.851 --> 32:48.836
What is his name?

32:48.936 --> 32:51.972
You do not know him.

32:52.764 --> 32:55.217
This friend?

32:55.317 --> 32:57.455
One who cultivates Satanism?

32:57.555 --> 32:59.656
And doing all those devil-masks?

32:59.756 --> 33:03.411
And work with it there
damned haunted house?

33:05.338 --> 33:07.338
Mommy.

33:07.905 --> 33:11.024
I'm not a little girl anymore.

33:11.124 --> 33:13.653
And he is not satanist.

33:13.753 --> 33:15.363
He is an artist.

33:15.463 --> 33:18.992
And he goes to Hollywood
a day to make things for movies.

33:19.092 --> 33:21.960
Movies.

33:22.878 --> 33:25.085
If he was a true artist..

33:25.185 --> 33:27.286
Would he use his talent,
of god statuettes...

33:27.386 --> 33:30.106
Of Jesus and angels and stuff...

33:30.802 --> 33:32.755
Do you remember what happened...

33:32.855 --> 33:38.470
Last time you
you involved with the film industry?

33:38.570 --> 33:41.017
If I were you,
I would go into my room..

33:41.117 --> 33:44.467
And read the liner,
I've marked your school bible.

33:44.567 --> 33:47.528
But it's your choice, dear.

34:05.629 --> 34:08.333
You will miss the best part.

34:08.433 --> 34:13.719
Are you okay?
- Yes, I have just a little nausea.

34:16.014 --> 34:19.717
You're not one of those with bulimia
hit actresses do you?

34:19.818 --> 34:23.188
It would be a waste of puffs.

34:28.819 --> 34:33.447
Have I told you I met
Tom Cruise, when I lived in LA?

34:33.949 --> 34:36.702
Is it true?

34:38.286 --> 34:40.155
How L.A.?

34:40.255 --> 34:43.625
If you liked it?
How is there?

34:56.429 --> 34:59.065
Do you remember him guy's face?

34:59.162 --> 35:02.387
Shut up, it was too funny.

35:02.487 --> 35:06.891
'Excuse me, I would
not scratch your car Mr.'

35:06.991 --> 35:08.991
Do you remember this?

35:09.088 --> 35:12.946
'Hey, what do i with the knife?'.

35:15.657 --> 35:18.285
What about this?

35:21.079 --> 35:23.916
'Please.'

35:25.000 --> 35:27.161
Shut up, it was fun.

35:27.261 --> 35:30.164
I blame you not,
you cut him up.

35:30.264 --> 35:32.624
But you must have you a long knife.

35:32.724 --> 35:36.974
It took you langtid getting
through his intestines.

35:42.851 --> 35:45.015
What the hell.
That was then.

35:45.115 --> 35:47.514
No one gets away to rise my car.

35:47.614 --> 35:48.849
Really?

35:48.949 --> 35:53.145
It took me a hell of a week and
$ 150 to fix that shit again.

35:53.245 --> 35:54.688
And then what?

35:54.788 --> 35:56.961
I could do it again, and
what the hell would you do about it?

35:57.061 --> 35:59.860
I let you escape the first time but I swear...

35:59.960 --> 36:03.914
..... If you touch my car again...

36:07.417 --> 36:10.379
What did sow? What?

36:13.757 --> 36:17.261
So I bury you.

36:31.275 --> 36:34.611
Stop now, he did not.
- Yes I did.

36:35.654 --> 36:39.483
What the hell are you saying?
It is here none of your business.

36:39.583 --> 36:43.078
Non-slip back into bed,
all.

36:44.663 --> 36:47.416
Do so.

36:57.259 --> 37:00.839
Shut up where I hate that motherfucker.

37:00.939 --> 37:05.009
The church is said not hate anyone.

37:05.109 --> 37:08.221
But that to pray for them.

37:08.321 --> 37:11.099
Is it that you have been so much recently?

37:11.199 --> 37:12.517
Yes.

37:12.617 --> 37:17.480
They are inspiring all those old stories.

37:17.580 --> 37:20.608
Where have you been lately?

37:20.708 --> 37:25.553
I have been with her girl
working down in the video store.

37:26.455 --> 37:27.949
She is sweet.

37:28.049 --> 37:32.036
She cleans the church sometimes.

37:32.136 --> 37:34.956
Her mother, Mrs.
. Duvet.

37:35.056 --> 37:39.927
She comes to all services.
Both Wednesday and Sunday.

37:40.302 --> 37:42.046
But it's weird...

37:42.146 --> 37:46.266
She's always here big white pillow with...

37:48.227 --> 37:51.897
Yes, it's a shame she's so sick.

37:52.439 --> 37:55.400
What do you think?

38:00.030 --> 38:02.608
Check out it here.

38:02.708 --> 38:05.619
Is not it awesome?

38:23.597 --> 38:25.597
Hello...

38:26.014 --> 38:30.385
How is it Green?
- Fine.

38:30.485 --> 38:34.515
I have tons of creepy things
I am just waiting for the last.

38:34.615 --> 38:42.106
Fair. It sounds like we get
a long queue around the house this year.

38:42.206 --> 38:49.404
They were discontinued for what
'SelfSkin'n Hydro Tone 35'.

38:49.504 --> 38:55.127
So I got hold of something 'Postcure 36'
instead.

38:55.711 --> 38:59.798
Is it good enough for you?
- Yes that's fine.

39:13.353 --> 39:17.482
It starts at. 21 not?
I'll be there.

39:27.993 --> 39:31.029
Have I got any mail today?

39:31.129 --> 39:34.032
I know sku ik.

39:34.132 --> 39:41.165
Was that new supplies of
plastic, grinding and brushes, from...

39:41.265 --> 39:43.125
Let's see...

39:43.225 --> 39:45.752
New York City?

39:45.852 --> 39:46.879
Yes.

39:46.979 --> 39:48.755
Yes hell.

39:48.855 --> 39:52.843
I sent it back by post.
Return to Sender.

39:52.943 --> 39:55.971
I told you not use
my money on this shit anymore.

39:56.071 --> 39:57.347
I do not either.

39:57.447 --> 40:02.269
It's my work stuff I need..
- Work?

40:02.369 --> 40:06.281
What the hell knows you to work?

40:06.949 --> 40:09.398
The only thing you're doing,
is sit in your room...

40:09.498 --> 40:13.103
And play with your clay and
your rubber monsters all day.

40:13.203 --> 40:16.321
Actually, you have to end of this week...

40:16.421 --> 40:21.096
To find you a real job,
otherwise all hell breaks loose.

40:24.299 --> 40:26.919
And you...

40:27.019 --> 40:30.929
Keeps your ass home
Sunday evening from now on.

40:31.017 --> 40:34.176
Please help me
reinforce the roof of the trailer.

40:34.276 --> 40:36.720
But it is the church tonight.
I can not do.

40:36.820 --> 40:40.557
In addition, says the church that you do
not need to work on a Sunday.

40:40.657 --> 40:43.652
Slurry shit.

41:04.089 --> 41:06.258
Satan.

41:16.018 --> 41:18.972
I've thought about it Earl.

41:19.072 --> 41:22.976
You are right.
I make an application to the chicken inn.

41:23.076 --> 41:25.694
Tomorrow.

41:28.489 --> 41:32.777
Sateme so.
It was damn about time too.

41:32.877 --> 41:36.322
Should mom be
back from the grocery store now?

41:36.422 --> 41:41.097
I had to borrow her car
to cinema. Do you think maybe...

41:41.182 --> 41:45.631
..... I could borrow your car?
I'll mind it.

43:57.513 --> 44:00.633
You little bastard.

44:00.733 --> 44:02.886
Do you want to steal my car.

44:02.986 --> 44:06.688
Can not exactly help me with the goods?

44:09.066 --> 44:11.478
What is going on here?

44:11.578 --> 44:13.980
I'll tell you...

44:14.080 --> 44:17.567
The little ungrateful skarnsunge,
trying to steal my car...

44:17.667 --> 44:21.745
..... To visit his tiny video whore.

44:22.746 --> 44:26.942
And I know in fact that she
has fucked half portion of the city.

44:27.042 --> 44:31.755
Slip back to your room.
You're not going anywhere.

44:55.737 --> 45:01.743
This time, it shakes you completely
into the bones, all of you.

45:09.459 --> 45:12.671
You should know I understand you kid.

45:13.672 --> 45:18.002
The only thing we can do is
to pray for him, okay?

45:18.102 --> 45:21.597
See you on Wednesday.

45:22.181 --> 45:24.221
Do you need a ride home?

45:24.310 --> 45:28.645
Otherwise, thank you.
I will meet with a friend.

45:47.581 --> 45:51.960
You are early on.
What if you had met my mother?

46:06.391 --> 46:09.678
You really must apologize for yesterday.
- It does not matter.

46:09.778 --> 46:12.815
You are here now.

46:59.236 --> 47:02.990
Green, there is something I must tell you.

47:10.289 --> 47:15.252
I love you.
I do not want you to feel embarrassed.

47:16.712 --> 47:19.373
Why sku me too?

47:19.473 --> 47:23.627
You are a virgin.
But I do not care.

47:23.727 --> 47:26.930
It will be wonderful.
I promise.

47:33.604 --> 47:37.224
Jesus.. </ i>...

47:37.324 --> 47:41.979
...You're the reason I live... </ i>...

47:42.079 --> 47:46.087
...I live... </ i>.

47:46.187 --> 47:48.861
Damn.

47:48.961 --> 47:51.371
Jesus... </ i>...

48:08.972 --> 48:13.143
...Jesus is your savior and forgives... </ i>...

48:13.519 --> 48:19.516
...And I know eh what I do sku without
for he always helps me through.. </ i>...

48:19.616 --> 48:24.886
...And I know do not you know
what I do without sku.. </ i>...

48:42.154 --> 48:44.458
Green?
- What?

48:44.558 --> 48:47.427
What is it?

48:52.140 --> 48:54.009
What?. It looks like...

48:54.109 --> 48:56.220
Are you okay?

48:56.320 --> 48:57.638
I'm fine.
What about you?

48:57.738 --> 49:00.399
Do I think then.

49:10.117 --> 49:12.678
I can not lie in this shit.
I will be murdered.

49:12.778 --> 49:15.647
Sorry.
I forgot I had it in my pocket.

49:15.747 --> 49:20.167
Do not worry it can be removed with water,
I promise.

49:20.878 --> 49:24.298
I find just the thing...

49:26.175 --> 49:28.927
What is it?

49:32.598 --> 49:35.350
How.
It was better.

49:36.059 --> 49:41.190
I come back after you.

49:51.909 --> 49:56.488
Did you ever the movies you were in?

49:56.588 --> 49:59.208
No.

50:05.214 --> 50:08.667
What is it you have placed in me?
It is soft.

50:08.767 --> 50:11.962
Someone pillow I found on the floor.

50:12.062 --> 50:14.473
Oh, my god.

50:25.108 --> 50:27.694
Come.

50:32.407 --> 50:34.944
Are you kidding me?
- No.

50:35.044 --> 50:37.238
And then it dawned on us
that it was 'The' pillow.

50:37.338 --> 50:39.491
The special pillow?
- Yes.

50:39.591 --> 50:41.785
But you fucked her carefully right?

50:41.885 --> 50:44.704
Shut up Billy. Why must everything
always be so 'rude' to you?

50:44.804 --> 50:49.224
I have just about plumber
fit the tube? Pussy. Pussy.

50:49.299 --> 50:51.960
Shut up Billy.
He likes her.

50:52.060 --> 50:54.060
Asshole.

50:57.516 --> 50:59.571
I have rented 'Cut them nicely'
in video tripe.

50:59.671 --> 51:01.470
Let's get Jay,
and watch it with me?

51:01.570 --> 51:03.431
Jay is in the church.

51:03.531 --> 51:04.849
Some people are crazy.

51:04.949 --> 51:06.851
This is what he pleases.

51:06.951 --> 51:10.105
Let's make something
we have not done soon.

51:10.205 --> 51:12.232
If you say: Catching fireflies.
Break myself.

51:12.332 --> 51:17.661
Calm Mr. Smart.
It was not what I would say.

51:52.654 --> 51:55.442
Stop it.
Your stupid son of a bitch.

51:55.542 --> 51:58.911
Get away from her.

52:00.245 --> 52:02.789
Slip of hell to.

52:12.993 --> 52:14.993
I called the cops mom.

52:29.024 --> 52:34.294
Is not that kind of shit
you like to see on TV you little shit?

52:38.617 --> 52:42.454
Is that scary enough for you?

53:38.719 --> 53:43.140
Do you have any idea
how all this happened?

53:45.100 --> 53:46.844
I do not know.

53:46.944 --> 53:49.258
And why did you
not clean at church last night?

53:49.358 --> 53:51.557
Breaks you several promises?

53:51.657 --> 53:55.519
I did not think it was this weekend. Sorry.

53:55.619 --> 54:00.274
I know you've been together with him
Graves kid.

54:00.374 --> 54:04.624
But I will not let him
take you with him, Angevine.

54:04.711 --> 54:06.952
Do you want me gone again?
Is that what you're looking for?

54:07.052 --> 54:09.841
Or is it because of your 'valuable' back?

54:09.941 --> 54:11.952
Great.

54:12.052 --> 54:14.052
Journey.

54:14.128 --> 54:18.584
But I do not come and rescue you again.
And as long as you are in my house,

54:18.684 --> 54:22.045
you see him not,
and you keep your promises to me.

54:22.145 --> 54:26.990
And you do not participate in any
the damned damned house.

54:39.238 --> 54:44.401
What have we done Green?
- Mr. Tightwiler you scared me.

54:44.501 --> 54:47.051
It's also the season in the...

54:47.108 --> 54:50.532
...you should probably
know more than others.

54:50.632 --> 54:52.534
I will soon be complete.

54:52.634 --> 54:56.622
I have sold a lot of tickets this year.

54:56.722 --> 55:01.585
You make a good kid.
Maybe you get a bonus.

55:01.685 --> 55:03.837
But there is something else...

55:03.937 --> 55:10.052
The bloody church group had
nose up your ass on me all week.

55:10.152 --> 55:13.391
I think they will try
to stop the 'ghost house'.

55:13.491 --> 55:14.692
What?

55:14.792 --> 55:20.218
I've worked hard so much.
- They do not understand it's for fun.

55:20.863 --> 55:25.623
You know I understand it...
But these over-holy people...

55:25.708 --> 55:29.989
..... They do not understand a bell.

55:30.089 --> 55:33.535
But I will try to keep
them away until Thursday.

55:33.635 --> 55:37.997
But then I went to Hunt Burg,
and there you must handle yourself.

55:38.097 --> 55:41.216
I'll handle it.

55:46.847 --> 55:51.553
What do you plan to use the
$ 250 you earn on it here for?

55:51.653 --> 55:56.315
I had thought of buying
a plane ticket and go to LA...

55:56.773 --> 56:00.937
But now I'm not so sure.
- Do what you feel is right, kid.

56:01.037 --> 56:04.566
You do not fit this city.

56:04.666 --> 56:07.152
You have talent.

56:07.252 --> 56:09.376
It's a strange world,
I know.

56:09.476 --> 56:13.301
You can not live by your talent in this city.

56:14.626 --> 56:17.711
You know that.

56:42.236 --> 56:46.156
Do not like it?
What?

56:46.740 --> 56:48.907
Throw it in the torture chamber.

56:49.007 --> 56:53.827
Come on by. Come on.
- Can not I be one of your demons?

56:55.666 --> 57:00.756
Dearest friends. I look
you as pilgrims and strangers..

57:00.856 --> 57:04.936
.. Filled with flesh,
as a war against your soul.

57:05.551 --> 57:09.555
Uh, what?
Excuse me can I help them?

57:11.682 --> 57:13.682
Yes, you can help me.

57:13.781 --> 57:17.889
You can start by not filling
my daughter with your occult beliefs.

57:17.989 --> 57:19.989
Your daughter?

57:20.065 --> 57:23.144
You walk around like...

57:23.244 --> 57:26.280
I am very sorry.

57:30.200 --> 57:33.321
She has no doubt...

57:33.421 --> 57:37.666
Demons made me as she pleases.

57:38.834 --> 57:42.329
You know not at Angevine.

57:42.429 --> 57:47.843
She likes you as a problem
separating truth from falsehood.

57:49.303 --> 57:53.015
Darkness from light.

57:55.058 --> 57:58.887
I hope she told you that you are special.

57:58.987 --> 58:02.024
That she loves you.

58:04.401 --> 58:07.488
Please go away.

58:15.746 --> 58:20.200
Do you know that this disgusting ritual
comes from the occult superstition?

58:20.300 --> 58:24.705
Yes, like July Do so here.

58:24.805 --> 58:28.008
I have also in mind.

58:52.866 --> 58:56.078
Hi Mom.
- Hello darling.

58:56.703 --> 58:57.863
Look...

58:57.963 --> 59:01.909
I know you worry about money now.

59:02.009 --> 59:03.952
And to keep the trailer, etc...

59:04.052 --> 59:09.341
But I will serve...
- Your breakfast is getting cold.

59:17.599 --> 59:22.763
Will you help me with the 'house' tonight?
- I can not.

59:22.863 --> 59:24.598
Why not?

59:24.698 --> 59:27.568
Church.

59:29.069 --> 59:34.066
You ought to go with me one day.
- Where the hell sku I?

59:34.166 --> 59:36.223
Everyone thinks what I do,
is satanic.

59:36.323 --> 59:38.403
No they do not.

59:38.503 --> 59:44.327
They just think you should use the talent
on the Lord instead, that's all.

59:44.427 --> 59:48.422
And that's it, huh?
What do you think?

59:58.724 --> 01:00:02.144
Where?
What do you think?

01:00:02.769 --> 01:00:08.484
Green, guard him from TV,
will ask you some questions.

01:00:18.035 --> 01:00:22.657
What can I help them?
- Tell where you were last night?

01:00:22.757 --> 01:00:29.122
Someone got the brilliant idea
to skæne our holy church.

01:00:29.222 --> 01:00:31.958
With spray paint.

01:00:32.058 --> 01:00:36.308
You probably know the good
the church does not it?

01:00:37.554 --> 01:00:41.301
I was in the 'Haunted House'.
- Did anyone see you?

01:00:41.401 --> 01:00:44.763
Only Mr. Tightwiler.
- How something my son would never do.

01:00:44.863 --> 01:00:48.099
I hope not. For his sake.
He is the authority now.

01:00:48.199 --> 01:00:50.810
Not something minor penalty.
But the real prison.

01:00:50.910 --> 01:00:55.656
So tell the truth.
- As I said, I have ik done it.

01:00:57.115 --> 01:01:01.078
Once.
I think now you did.

01:01:45.539 --> 01:01:49.418
How long have you known this?

01:01:51.128 --> 01:01:54.089
Is it him?

01:02:07.352 --> 01:02:13.016
Mobile.
It's an idiot in Mobile.

01:02:13.116 --> 01:02:16.653
No more broken promises.

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:22.693
We have a long driving trip ahead of us.
Red now your bed, my dear.

01:02:22.793 --> 01:02:25.779
And stop lying.

01:02:25.879 --> 01:02:28.999
A bad choice.

01:02:59.655 --> 01:03:04.243
Are you sure?
- Do you know for sure it was him?

01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:09.574
Because with them as a witness, I can
fetch him here immediately.

01:03:09.674 --> 01:03:15.371
I am sure. I have not said anything
before now because he knows where I live.

01:03:15.471 --> 01:03:18.958
And I fear for my daughter's safety.

01:03:19.058 --> 01:03:22.344
How is she?

01:03:23.470 --> 01:03:26.390
Much better.

01:03:29.601 --> 01:03:33.889
But I prayed this morning...
And God told me not to fear...

01:03:33.989 --> 01:03:37.359
..... But that I should tell the truth.

01:03:38.277 --> 01:03:42.315
Thank you, deputy sheriff.
- Thank you for your courage.

01:03:42.415 --> 01:03:46.827
It must be hard for them to do this.

01:03:51.623 --> 01:03:56.079
Why do not you just confess and
save yourself a lot of problems?

01:03:56.179 --> 01:03:58.284
You know the court is in Faris Field.

01:03:58.384 --> 01:04:01.034
You can quickly go some
months before they reach your case.

01:04:01.134 --> 01:04:04.337
And with a witness..

01:04:04.437 --> 01:04:06.341
Does not it look too good
out for you, superstar.

01:04:06.441 --> 01:04:08.641
Should I call the Hollywood
and say you do not come?

01:04:08.741 --> 01:04:11.219
What was the number for Hollywood?
555th...

01:04:11.319 --> 01:04:14.646
I have not done anything.

01:04:23.986 --> 01:04:26.166
It's sad.

01:04:28.118 --> 01:04:33.123
I warn you woman.
Sneak not enter a man.

01:04:33.707 --> 01:04:36.457
Why do we never you at services anymore?

01:04:36.557 --> 01:04:40.457
I prefer a bible based assembly.

01:04:40.557 --> 01:04:46.261
We are Bible-based Sam...
- Save your voice, it does not help.

01:04:49.389 --> 01:04:52.874
You might as well pill all the dirt down.

01:04:52.964 --> 01:04:55.513
There is nothing
'haunted house' in the evening.

01:04:55.613 --> 01:05:02.236
What logs do you know about woman now?
- The Green Graves in jail and such.

01:05:04.863 --> 01:05:07.783
What have you been doing?

01:05:11.203 --> 01:05:14.248
Excuse me.

01:05:33.642 --> 01:05:37.467
I should just empty your pockets
here to disk.

01:05:46.905 --> 01:05:49.775
Wait a minute, Billy Martin.

01:05:49.875 --> 01:05:52.111
What have we here?

01:05:52.211 --> 01:05:58.125
A homemade lock dirkesæt.
Maybe it's you we should watch for?

01:06:01.253 --> 01:06:04.298
Check it just once.

01:06:04.756 --> 01:06:07.835
Cyndi Lauper rang
she wanted his pants back.

01:06:07.935 --> 01:06:11.205
I have to say Green,
all'm sure you've done it.

01:06:11.305 --> 01:06:15.334
Mr. Tightwiler samples of
raise some money and get you out.

01:06:15.434 --> 01:06:19.763
What is the 'situation' here?
I hear it should be top notch?

01:06:19.863 --> 01:06:24.184
But I must say it is getting
hard to defend yourself all the time.

01:06:24.284 --> 01:06:29.106
Mom is in Hunt Burg
and buy some new shoes for her new job.

01:06:29.206 --> 01:06:33.735
I say you are with Billy until tomorrow.
I will not make her uneasy.

01:06:33.835 --> 01:06:36.822
Good idea.

01:06:36.922 --> 01:06:39.772
I do not understand.
Mrs. Duvet has explained that she saw me.

01:06:39.872 --> 01:06:43.871
Whatever they have your ass
safely to your can pursue a case.

01:06:43.971 --> 01:06:48.884
How about 'Haunted House' tonight?
- And Hollywood?

01:06:50.719 --> 01:06:56.244
Deputy Sheriff's fool chasing us out
here soon, so let us proceed.

01:06:58.894 --> 01:07:02.514
I ask only one time buddy...

01:07:02.614 --> 01:07:05.609
Did you know?

01:07:06.401 --> 01:07:08.904
No.

01:07:27.798 --> 01:07:30.751
It's okay.

01:07:30.851 --> 01:07:34.304
This is a misconception.

01:07:35.347 --> 01:07:39.518
I am soon out and then we can talk, okay?

01:07:41.186 --> 01:07:45.399
I have not done it here,
you know that right?

01:07:46.608 --> 01:07:49.695
I soon nothing.

01:07:55.659 --> 01:08:00.197
I've tried to escape so many times...

01:08:00.297 --> 01:08:03.584
But I always end up here again.

01:08:05.794 --> 01:08:09.047
I'm a wreck Green.

01:08:11.341 --> 01:08:15.012
I really hate myself right now.

01:08:15.846 --> 01:08:17.171
Time has elapsed.

01:08:17.272 --> 01:08:20.759
I'll see.
- Wait, hear..

01:08:20.859 --> 01:08:23.895
.. What do you mean?

01:08:24.438 --> 01:08:28.317
It was not so good huh?

01:08:31.111 --> 01:08:32.770
It's Hollywood on the phone.

01:08:32.871 --> 01:08:36.200
Should I take a message?

01:08:38.618 --> 01:08:43.283
I do not know whether you realize it, but
your little girlfriend...

01:08:43.383 --> 01:08:47.453
She got in trouble for some months
ago when she ran away from his mother.

01:08:47.554 --> 01:08:48.642
She came di...

01:08:48.742 --> 01:08:53.666
...all sorts of problems you
might not want to hear about.

01:08:53.765 --> 01:08:55.765
Unless you..

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:59.173
.. Really want to get I will tell it?

01:08:59.273 --> 01:09:02.259
We had to go all the way to LA to fetch her.

01:09:02.359 --> 01:09:05.813
The lower Alabama.

01:09:06.522 --> 01:09:11.885
He she asked you whether you want to see
the little 'Skin film' She did?

01:09:11.984 --> 01:09:15.029
Satan good movie.

01:09:16.323 --> 01:09:19.368
It's Hollywood.

01:09:45.435 --> 01:09:47.683
Come on.
- It was sku time.

01:09:47.783 --> 01:09:50.131
Since Mr. Tightwiler
paid my bail several hours ago.

01:09:50.232 --> 01:09:53.443
The old man.

01:10:00.367 --> 01:10:03.487
What happened?
Why sku we give an explanation?

01:10:03.587 --> 01:10:06.498
I do not know.

01:10:13.839 --> 01:10:17.092
No clue.

01:10:54.475 --> 01:10:56.957
Hello?

01:10:57.057 --> 01:11:00.511
How dare you call this?

01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:02.880
Now listen here.

01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:05.278
I know you did it.
I know.

01:11:05.378 --> 01:11:09.420
And as long as I live sheep
you never see her anymore.

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:12.240
Fuck her.
It's Halloween, dammit.

01:11:12.325 --> 01:11:15.300
Your best favorite day of the year.

01:11:15.526 --> 01:11:16.775
You should be happy.

01:11:16.875 --> 01:11:21.724
I have an idea, sku we
walk in the woods and catch fireflies?

01:11:21.824 --> 01:11:26.487
Now that it's Halloween, why
we did not look at the cemetery?

01:11:26.587 --> 01:11:28.405
It could be cool.

01:11:28.505 --> 01:11:33.869
Time to visit Satan.
You will probably soon to Hollywood.

01:11:33.969 --> 01:11:37.881
It is perhaps our last chance.

01:11:40.634 --> 01:11:41.877
I do not know..

01:11:41.977 --> 01:11:46.306
No, guys, I have sku
started with 'Haunted House'.

01:12:14.418 --> 01:12:18.505
THOMAS Duvet- 'Devoted Dad'.

01:12:39.307 --> 01:12:41.932
Candy or trouble... </ i>.

01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:08.597
I hope you're ready?

01:14:15.164 --> 01:14:19.334
There are so many people outside.

01:14:21.044 --> 01:14:23.706
You are famous.
- Mom, what are you doing here?

01:14:23.806 --> 01:14:28.336
I just wanted to see what you're doing.
- No, it should not be that way.

01:14:28.436 --> 01:14:30.800
Someone has been here
and destroy everything.

01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:33.800
How can I get a
job in L.A. without a recommendation.

01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:36.970
It's okay honey.

01:14:37.070 --> 01:14:38.555
No, Mom, it's not okay.

01:14:38.655 --> 01:14:41.773
You do not understand.

01:14:42.733 --> 01:14:46.904
I do not really understand any of that here.

01:14:48.071 --> 01:14:51.483
But I am so proud of you.

01:14:51.583 --> 01:14:56.288
You'll get by.
To do this forever.

01:14:57.581 --> 01:15:01.452
What about the trailer.

01:15:01.552 --> 01:15:04.705
I start as a waitress.

01:15:04.805 --> 01:15:07.583
I can help you to buy equipment.

01:15:07.683 --> 01:15:09.683
We'll get by.

01:15:09.769 --> 01:15:11.795
See my new shoes.

01:15:11.895 --> 01:15:16.266
Are not they cool?
- Yes, they are fine.

01:15:17.226 --> 01:15:21.221
Promise me you'll
a really big name someday.

01:15:21.321 --> 01:15:24.933
So you can buy us a nice big house.

01:15:25.033 --> 01:15:28.320
And get us out of here.

01:15:30.197 --> 01:15:33.033
I promise, Mom.

01:15:34.827 --> 01:15:38.705
I've had my teeth.
- View.

01:15:47.089 --> 01:15:50.342
I'm really sorry.

01:15:54.763 --> 01:16:00.144
The only thing I wanted was
to the boys sku not miss anything.

01:16:00.811 --> 01:16:04.189
I love you both so much.

01:16:05.774 --> 01:16:09.394
Have a diet or something?
- Do not worry about it mom.

01:16:09.494 --> 01:16:12.189
The boys coming soon.

01:16:12.289 --> 01:16:15.984
I put something
to you on the step in the cart.

01:16:16.084 --> 01:16:19.947
Just not now is somewhat creepy.

01:16:20.047 --> 01:16:24.910
Bye mom.

01:16:25.010 --> 01:16:29.006
I love you.
- I love you too.

01:16:29.673 --> 01:16:33.093
Happy Halloween.

01:16:46.815 --> 01:16:51.320
Pis, also, we're on it.
Shit just picked up.

I have not been along with anyone else.

01:18:18.863 --> 01:18:20.863
I have studied.

01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:26.081
Close ass bitch.
I hear everything that takes place here.

01:18:27.207 --> 01:18:32.137
You fuck my cousin Rusty, right?
- You're sick in the head.

01:18:32.546 --> 01:18:37.426
I've been with my children, no one else.

01:18:39.261 --> 01:18:45.434
So sweet, I could break me.

01:18:53.275 --> 01:18:57.780
Where the hell is your
wedding ring your little whore?

01:18:59.448 --> 01:19:02.659
We are finished.

01:19:09.708 --> 01:19:13.545
Do you remember what I told you Jenny?

01:19:14.752 --> 01:19:16.752
Can you?

01:20:15.732 --> 01:20:19.812
We must leave,
there is something wrong with mom.

01:22:09.054 --> 01:22:12.182
What the hell?

01:22:21.483 --> 01:22:24.361
To hell then.

01:22:31.743 --> 01:22:33.743
The goddamn idiot.

01:22:35.289 --> 01:22:37.991
I warned him.

01:22:38.091 --> 01:22:41.128
The damned fool.

01:22:59.605 --> 01:23:02.691
What the hell?.

01:24:02.668 --> 01:24:04.036
Wait. Wait.

01:24:04.136 --> 01:24:07.506
We need to talk.

01:24:08.674 --> 01:24:12.086
I'm so sorry about your mom.

01:24:12.186 --> 01:24:17.925
Do not say anything about my mother.
Stay away from me.

01:24:18.025 --> 01:24:21.228
I am progressing in the morning.

01:24:41.039 --> 01:24:47.079
I can not afford both of us
can fly, but we can take the bus.

01:24:47.179 --> 01:24:51.300
Really?
- Yes, go with me.

01:24:52.342 --> 01:24:56.839
We will find you an actor job or something.

01:24:56.939 --> 01:25:00.225
I'm finished.

01:25:05.564 --> 01:25:08.942
I made a mistake.

01:25:10.527 --> 01:25:14.031
I tried Green.

01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:20.704
I never went to Hollywood.

01:25:22.915 --> 01:25:27.829
I went to Mobile and
was this dank producer..

01:25:27.929 --> 01:25:30.923
It's okay.

01:25:31.757 --> 01:25:36.178
Meet me at the bus station tomorrow okay?

01:25:44.263 --> 01:25:46.263
Green?

01:25:47.774 --> 01:25:49.183
Mr Tightwiler?
- Yes.

01:25:49.283 --> 01:25:53.228
Why did you get your way again?

01:25:53.328 --> 01:25:55.745
Sorry.
I thought you were someone else.

01:25:55.845 --> 01:26:00.944
While your monsters were smashed, the
I decided to pay you anyway.

01:26:01.044 --> 01:26:03.201
No, I can not take your money.

01:26:03.301 --> 01:26:06.416
You should sku.
It is 350 dollars.

01:26:08.919 --> 01:26:13.708
Is it enough for your plane ticket?
- I do not know what to say.

01:26:13.808 --> 01:26:18.254
You do not say anything.
You've earned it.

01:26:18.354 --> 01:26:24.552
Thank you for everything Mr. Tightwiler.
- Make us proud in Hollywood.

01:26:24.652 --> 01:26:27.680
I'll try.

01:26:27.780 --> 01:26:31.650
I'm sorry about your mother.

01:26:39.366 --> 01:26:42.995
Clear it?

01:26:46.498 --> 01:26:50.836
You would not like Detroit.
I think that I did.

01:26:52.921 --> 01:26:57.256
I'm pretty sure
on they do not have fireflies there.

01:26:58.218 --> 01:27:02.139
I must also soon...
- I know..

01:27:06.935 --> 01:27:10.564
I'm really proud of you.

01:27:12.566 --> 01:27:16.320
Do the fireflies in L.A.?

01:27:16.862 --> 01:27:20.199
I'm not sure.

01:27:20.782 --> 01:27:24.453
Maybe I could take some with.

01:27:27.331 --> 01:27:30.951
Mommy, it's your last chance.

01:27:31.051 --> 01:27:34.997
I swear I leave tomorrow.

01:27:35.097 --> 01:27:38.917
I do not believe in you...

01:27:39.017 --> 01:27:43.013
And that was the agreement.
- I will.

01:27:43.514 --> 01:27:46.767
But you first.

01:27:50.521 --> 01:27:53.524
Mom, just let go of him.

01:28:33.313 --> 01:28:36.942
This is all I have left.

01:28:49.079 --> 01:28:52.991
Promise you that this is the only one?

01:28:53.091 --> 01:28:56.545
This is the only one here in town.

01:30:17.709 --> 01:30:21.171
Where are all your stuff?

01:30:21.922 --> 01:30:24.842
I can not go.

01:30:26.969 --> 01:30:30.430
I just can not.

01:30:33.142 --> 01:30:36.061
I'm afraid.

01:30:36.812 --> 01:30:40.274
Afraid not cope with the outside.

01:30:45.863 --> 01:30:50.075
I do not know if I can handle it alone.

01:30:50.534 --> 01:30:53.821
I need you with me.

01:30:53.921 --> 01:30:56.790
No you have not.

01:30:59.710 --> 01:31:02.200
Will not you join me?
Bus ride soon.

01:31:02.300 --> 01:31:06.117
You should fly and not take the bus.

01:31:14.975 --> 01:31:18.145
Do Just.

01:31:27.654 --> 01:31:30.866
See you.

01:31:32.784 --> 01:31:35.279
If you run into Tom Cruise..

01:31:35.379 --> 01:31:38.790
.. So get me an autograph, okay.
