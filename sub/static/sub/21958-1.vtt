WEBVTT

00:28.571 --> 00:31.908
Rich city folks
and their fancy apartments.

00:34.494 --> 00:38.373
But their air is so polluted,
they can't even see the stars.

00:43.712 --> 00:48.007
We'd have to be out of our minds
to trade places with any of them.

00:54.222 --> 00:56.349
...four sources,
saying that it is.

00:56.433 --> 00:57.642
What did he say?

00:57.726 --> 01:00.770
He said, "Jeannette Walls,

01:00.854 --> 01:04.190
you are nothing but a bottom feeder
with a silly little gossip column.

01:04.274 --> 01:08.820
If you print this story, I will have my
lawyers go so far up your ass

01:08.903 --> 01:11.030
that you will taste
their ink in your mouth."

01:11.114 --> 01:13.032
Oh my gosh. And what did you say?

01:13.116 --> 01:15.676
I thanked him for the perfect kicker quote
and hung up the phone.

01:16.870 --> 01:18.955
The whole office gave her
a standing ovation.

01:19.038 --> 01:20.498
And you ran it?

01:20.582 --> 01:22.584
Oh, heck yeah I ran it. Where I come from,

01:22.667 --> 01:25.670
you never miss an opportunity to serve
a bully a slice of humble pie.

01:28.673 --> 01:31.885
Could you box this up for me, and maybe
yours too if you're not gonna eat it?

01:33.762 --> 01:36.055
- Yeah.
She's just kidding.

01:36.139 --> 01:38.099
No, I'm not. I never joke about food.

01:38.767 --> 01:40.894
So, where are you from
Miss Walls?

01:41.352 --> 01:43.772
I think I detect
a slight twang in there somewhere.

01:45.231 --> 01:46.775
Jeannette grew up in Virginia.

01:46.858 --> 01:50.653
Surrounded by trees
and fields of wildflowers.

01:50.737 --> 01:52.405
If we could all be so lucky.

01:53.198 --> 01:55.283
I own a mining company near Richmond.

01:56.159 --> 01:57.327
Your folks still there?

01:58.203 --> 02:01.831
Ah, yup, they are. They have, uh,
little house there on a hill

02:01.915 --> 02:04.626
overlooking a river and they love it.
Yeah.

02:04.709 --> 02:05.877
And what do they do?

02:07.504 --> 02:09.547
My mom is an artist.

02:09.631 --> 02:12.300
My dad, um, is an engineer.

02:12.383 --> 02:14.594
He's developing a technology that'll burn

02:14.677 --> 02:16.763
low-grade bituminous coal
more efficiently.

02:16.846 --> 02:18.264
Wow.

02:18.640 --> 02:21.309
Well, you have him give me a call when
he has that figured out.

02:21.851 --> 02:23.144
I sure will.

02:23.228 --> 02:25.939
And what do they think of you hitching off
with this big city boy?

02:27.941 --> 02:29.484
Well, I haven't told them yet.

02:30.902 --> 02:33.446
Well, Tiffany still hasn't told
her parents about me

02:33.530 --> 02:35.448
and we've been together over a year.

02:37.033 --> 02:40.161
Well, you better hurry up.
Who knows how much time he's got left.

02:47.085 --> 02:50.213
That was unbelievable.

02:50.296 --> 02:52.590
I can't believe he gave me
the account on the spot.

02:52.674 --> 02:54.509
I know. This is huge for the firm.

02:54.592 --> 02:57.011
I'm taking you with me
to all of these from now on.

02:58.513 --> 03:01.266
I'm gonna be home soon. I just want
to have everything ready for them

03:01.349 --> 03:02.829
- to sign in the morning.
- All right.

03:04.561 --> 03:07.397
Hey, when it comes to my family,

03:07.480 --> 03:09.107
let me do the lying, okay?

03:10.775 --> 03:11.776
You got it.

03:14.737 --> 03:16.614
Hey, don't forget your leftovers.

03:16.698 --> 03:18.700
- See you at home.
- Love you. Bye.

03:40.972 --> 03:42.348
You in a hurry?

03:42.432 --> 03:45.393
Come on man. Ah, jeez.

03:48.187 --> 03:49.999
You need
to get out of the street.

03:51.566 --> 03:52.692
Hey!

04:03.453 --> 04:05.580
- Hello?
- Hey, Lori.

04:05.663 --> 04:07.373
Hey, Jeannette. What's going on?

04:11.920 --> 04:14.339
I just saw Mom and Dad
digging through the trash in downtown.

04:14.422 --> 04:17.759
Did Mom find any new treasures?

04:22.055 --> 04:23.431
I didn't stop.

04:24.432 --> 04:26.059
What? Why not?

04:29.062 --> 04:30.146
I don't know.

04:31.731 --> 04:33.983
Are you okay?

04:37.612 --> 04:39.072
Jeannette?

04:46.621 --> 04:51.584
-  My wild Irish Rose
- Mom, are we gonna have any lunch?

04:52.710 --> 04:54.879
Go outside and play with Brian and Lori.

04:56.381 --> 04:57.840
But I'm hungry.

05:01.386 --> 05:04.555
Would you rather me make you
some food that'll be gone in an hour,

05:05.181 --> 05:08.309
or finish this painting
that'll last forever?

05:11.354 --> 05:14.232
Go on, you know how to do it.

05:15.692 --> 05:21.698
My wild Irish Rose

05:23.199 --> 05:29.038
The dearest flower that grows

05:29.747 --> 05:33.334
And some day for my sake

05:35.628 --> 05:37.130
How many do you want, Mom?

05:37.213 --> 05:38.798
Two, please.

05:52.353 --> 05:56.607
My wild Irish...

05:59.193 --> 06:02.780
- ...Rose

06:03.489 --> 06:04.824
Rex!

06:07.660 --> 06:13.166
Jeannette, can you tell Miss Kelly why you
were cooking hot dogs all by yourself?

06:13.791 --> 06:15.209
I cook all the time.

06:17.462 --> 06:21.966
You know the address that your parents
gave us doesn't seem to be right.

06:22.633 --> 06:24.051
Where do you live?

06:24.135 --> 06:27.346
All over. Dad says,
"Our home goes wherever we go."

06:27.430 --> 06:31.267
And where do you go to school?

06:32.435 --> 06:34.854
That's how gray wolves call
for their family.

06:38.941 --> 06:40.985
Mountain Goat,
where the hell are you?

06:41.068 --> 06:42.487
I'm in here.

06:46.491 --> 06:48.826
Oh, sorry, doctor.
Just having a little fun getting those

06:48.910 --> 06:51.138
- healing endorphins going.
- Mr. Walls, I'm Doctor Taylor.

06:51.162 --> 06:53.164
No offense, you got a lot of sick
on that hand.

06:53.247 --> 06:55.750
This here is Miss Kelly.

06:55.833 --> 06:57.293
She's our resident social worker.

06:57.376 --> 06:59.170
These guys treating you okay?

06:59.253 --> 07:01.839
There's so much food here,
you can eat as much as you want.

07:01.923 --> 07:04.300
Maybe I should break my arm.

07:04.383 --> 07:05.468
Me too.

07:06.260 --> 07:08.471
- What happened to him?
- He fell off the couch

07:08.554 --> 07:10.114
and cracked his head open on the floor.

07:10.181 --> 07:12.600
He's fine.
- There was blood everywhere.

07:13.351 --> 07:14.519
You should check him in.

07:14.602 --> 07:17.063
One kid in the hospital
at a time is enough.

07:17.146 --> 07:21.400
Besides, Brian's head is so hard, I think
the floor took more damage than he did.

07:23.152 --> 07:25.863
Mr. Walls, I don't find any
of this very funny.

07:26.948 --> 07:28.407
Any of what, Doc?

07:28.491 --> 07:31.077
These children need proper care
and you're making a joke of it.

07:33.955 --> 07:36.040
- Rex.
- Dad.

07:37.375 --> 07:40.711
A veteran of the US Air Force brings
his little girl in here

07:40.795 --> 07:43.464
so that you can wrap her in a band-aid
and hand him a bill

07:43.548 --> 07:45.800
for than a pilot makes in a year.

07:46.342 --> 07:50.221
Now my family won't eat for three months
so you can drive a Cadillac.

07:50.888 --> 07:53.140
You're part of a system
that is getting rich off

07:53.224 --> 07:55.977
of the human need to survive, Doc.

07:56.060 --> 07:58.020
You call that "proper care?"

07:58.104 --> 07:59.355
Mr. Walls.

08:00.356 --> 08:01.816
Can we have a moment, please?

08:06.779 --> 08:09.323
Dad's in trouble, Mountain Goat.

08:09.782 --> 08:11.033
We'll be back.

08:12.660 --> 08:14.287
Come on, kids. Time to go.

08:21.961 --> 08:22.962
Okay.

08:23.671 --> 08:27.174
In order to pull this off,
every fiber in your being

08:27.258 --> 08:29.343
got to believe that this is real.

08:29.427 --> 08:33.014
If you can convince yourself
then you can convince them too.

08:33.097 --> 08:34.140
You got it?

08:35.265 --> 08:37.476
Good. Let's see that poker face.

08:38.184 --> 08:40.730
Regular face. Poker.

08:40.813 --> 08:43.107
Regular. Poker. Regular. Poker.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.902
Regular. Poker. Incredible. Let's go.

09:38.037 --> 09:39.914
Morning, sunshine.

09:40.623 --> 09:42.333
You ready to skedaddle?

09:47.672 --> 09:49.382
Good to go, Brian. Wrap it up!

09:50.675 --> 09:51.968
Bye!

10:49.191 --> 10:51.986
I've been looking into this
new solar ring glass.

10:52.486 --> 10:55.823
It lets in the light but blocks radiation.

10:55.906 --> 10:59.326
It will drastically reduce
our energy demands.

10:59.410 --> 11:02.288
Is it still gonna have glass walls
and a glass ceiling?

11:02.997 --> 11:05.916
Of course. How else are we gonna see
the stars at night?

11:07.043 --> 11:09.754
You think my room can have glass stairs
going up to it?

11:11.297 --> 11:13.299
That's a great idea.

11:13.382 --> 11:15.134
Uh, baby, take the wheel.

11:15.676 --> 11:18.220
Structurally we could make that work

11:18.304 --> 11:21.515
if it was a spiral with a steel stringer.

11:21.599 --> 11:25.352
That way, all the weight pushes
in toward the middle.

11:25.436 --> 11:28.189
Just don't let it block any light
to my studio.

11:28.272 --> 11:29.607
I need full exposure.

11:29.690 --> 11:32.151
Oh, I like full exposure from you, dear.

11:35.112 --> 11:37.031
You really think we'll build it?

11:37.114 --> 11:38.407
Of course.

11:38.491 --> 11:39.533
When?

11:39.617 --> 11:42.620
You know, this running around
is only temporary.

11:42.703 --> 11:47.458
We just need the perfect location
and then we can get to work on our castle.

11:48.918 --> 11:51.378
Okay, now who needs a book?

11:51.462 --> 11:53.005
Me.
- Me.

11:53.089 --> 11:54.799
You can drive.

11:55.341 --> 11:57.551
Here's a new Zane Grey adventure.

11:58.094 --> 12:01.222
And, oh, look.
You'll love this one, Jeannette.

12:01.305 --> 12:02.515
Black Beauty.

12:03.432 --> 12:05.935
It's like Uncle Tom's Cabin,
but for horses.

12:06.685 --> 12:09.730
Dr. Taylor said,
staying home and reading books on our own

12:09.814 --> 12:11.982
isn't a well-rounded education.

12:12.441 --> 12:13.859
Oh, really?

12:14.568 --> 12:16.654
He said we should be going to real school.

12:17.655 --> 12:19.323
A real school, huh?

12:21.242 --> 12:23.536
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

12:24.328 --> 12:25.764
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

12:31.794 --> 12:33.379
You're gonna kill us!

12:36.799 --> 12:38.008
Dad!

12:40.761 --> 12:42.012
Everyone out.

12:42.721 --> 12:43.931
Come on!

12:44.974 --> 12:46.350
Look at this.

12:47.059 --> 12:51.272
All those Juniper and Joshua trees
have adapted to survive

12:51.355 --> 12:54.400
on only five inches of rainfall a year.

12:54.984 --> 12:59.947
That inselberg was formed from cooling
magma over a hundred million years ago.

13:00.781 --> 13:03.409
Pretty soon, the sun's coming down
and we'll be watching

13:03.492 --> 13:09.582
Orion and Aquarius and Horologion
rotate through the night's sky.

13:09.665 --> 13:12.376
This is as real as it gets, kids!

13:12.459 --> 13:16.046
And don't let no
dumbass doctor tell you different.

13:16.130 --> 13:18.632
You learn from living!

13:19.300 --> 13:21.468
Everything else is a damn lie.

13:22.178 --> 13:24.388
Oh! Look at that.

13:24.471 --> 13:25.890
What is it, baby?

13:25.973 --> 13:29.977
That is the most beautiful tree
I've ever seen!

13:30.060 --> 13:32.062
Somebody get my canvas!

13:33.147 --> 13:35.566
It looks like
we'll be sleeping here tonight, kids.

13:36.734 --> 13:39.278
This is actually great
for your posture.

13:39.862 --> 13:44.325
You know, the Indian's never use pillows
either and look how straight they stand.

13:47.369 --> 13:48.662
Why that one?

13:49.872 --> 13:54.335
The wind's been beaten
that tree down since the day it was born.

13:55.002 --> 13:57.129
But it refuses to fall.

13:58.714 --> 14:00.507
It's the struggle that
gives it its beauty.

14:34.792 --> 14:38.295
Dad. Dad.

14:39.588 --> 14:40.839
Hmm?

14:41.674 --> 14:44.635
I think maybe I saw something out there.

14:46.637 --> 14:50.057
All right. Did you get a good look at it?

14:52.268 --> 14:53.310
Not really.

14:54.937 --> 14:59.358
Was he a big ol' hairy son of a bitch

14:59.441 --> 15:02.778
with the damnedest lookin'
teeth and claws?

15:03.487 --> 15:05.698
- Maybe.
- Uh-huh.

15:06.323 --> 15:12.371
And uh, did it have pointy ears and
evil eyes with fire in them?

15:14.623 --> 15:15.916
You've seen him too?

15:16.000 --> 15:17.793
Oh yeah. Yeah.

15:17.876 --> 15:21.005
I've been chasing that demon for years.

15:22.881 --> 15:24.216
Where'd you see him?

15:26.135 --> 15:27.177
Ow.

15:30.723 --> 15:32.433
I gotta get that off of you.

15:35.394 --> 15:38.272
It's okay, fire can't get you here.

15:40.190 --> 15:42.401
We're just gonna let
this wound breathe a little.

15:43.402 --> 15:44.570
Yeah?

15:45.654 --> 15:48.699
Now I want you
to just hold this puppy right there.

15:51.994 --> 15:56.498
You see the top of the flames where
the yellow dissolves into the heat?

15:57.416 --> 16:02.796
That zone is known in physics as
the boundary between turbulence and order.

16:04.089 --> 16:07.301
It's a place where no rules apply.

16:08.344 --> 16:11.138
Or at least,
they haven't figured 'em out yet.

16:12.514 --> 16:14.350
And that's how life is.

16:15.059 --> 16:18.896
A bunch of molecules bouncing off
each other at random.

16:20.022 --> 16:24.401
So there's no point in trying to find
a reason or pattern

16:24.485 --> 16:27.446
for why you were born at a certain time

16:27.529 --> 16:29.865
or why you got bit by that fire.

16:30.949 --> 16:34.912
You just got a little too close
to the chaos is all.

16:37.790 --> 16:39.124
You understand?

16:43.045 --> 16:44.963
I'm not sure I do either.

16:49.760 --> 16:52.596
There. How's that feel?

17:14.326 --> 17:16.662
Jeannette.
- Yeah?

17:18.079 --> 17:19.915
Got a surprise for you in here.

17:21.541 --> 17:22.751
Okay.

17:25.045 --> 17:27.756
You said it was fun.

17:27.839 --> 17:30.092
No, I said it was funny.

17:30.175 --> 17:32.511
- Okay, well...
- And it's very overpriced.

17:33.554 --> 17:35.431
It's Italian. That's why.

17:35.514 --> 17:36.932
Just sit down in it.

17:37.015 --> 17:39.101
Enjoy the chair for a second.

17:41.979 --> 17:43.856
Just wiggle around in it a little bit.

17:45.315 --> 17:46.942
You're not wiggling... There you go.

17:49.111 --> 17:50.487
I'll take it back. It's fine.

17:50.571 --> 17:52.549
- No, no. It's fine. I'm just...
- Don't worry about it.

17:52.573 --> 17:55.617
- I'll take the chair back.
- It's not about the chair. I...

17:56.702 --> 17:58.579
I'm getting lunch with my mom today.

18:06.336 --> 18:08.839
I didn't tell you
'cause I didn't want you to worry.

18:08.922 --> 18:10.632
Are you gonna tell her?

18:10.716 --> 18:12.092
About, about us?

18:14.261 --> 18:16.221
I'm gonna have to tell her at some point.

18:17.473 --> 18:18.473
Okay.

18:19.558 --> 18:21.685
Okay.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.729
Just, please,

18:23.812 --> 18:27.107
try to not let her dump
her crap on you this time.

18:28.192 --> 18:29.735
That's what parents are for.

18:29.818 --> 18:31.403
Can you just try though?

18:32.070 --> 18:34.072
- Of course I'll try.
- Thank you.

18:42.247 --> 18:43.540
Mom?

18:47.085 --> 18:50.380
Well, your dad said he saw you pass by
in a cab the other night.

18:50.464 --> 18:52.299
Acted like we weren't even there.

18:52.925 --> 18:54.426
You shouldn't be ashamed of us

18:54.510 --> 18:56.887
just 'cause we choose
a different lifestyle than you.

18:56.970 --> 19:00.516
Being homeless in New York City
does not count as a lifestyle choice.

19:00.599 --> 19:02.851
Well, if we heard from you more you'd know

19:02.935 --> 19:05.103
that we found a lovely place
on the Lower East Side.

19:05.979 --> 19:08.398
Lori says you're squatting
in an abandoned building.

19:08.482 --> 19:10.776
That does not sound safe, Mom.

19:10.859 --> 19:12.945
Why did you lose your sense of adventure?

19:13.820 --> 19:16.532
I have a little bit of money now,
I can help you if you want.

19:16.615 --> 19:20.202
Nuh-uh. We're fine.
You're the one that needs help.

19:20.285 --> 19:23.330
Look at you. Your values are all confused

19:31.129 --> 19:33.298
So, what did you want to talk about?

19:37.427 --> 19:38.762
I'm getting married.

19:42.933 --> 19:44.476
To the accountant?

19:45.060 --> 19:47.437
David is a financial analyst.

19:48.188 --> 19:52.651
Well, I don't mean to be rude
but isn't he a little...

19:52.734 --> 19:55.404
Mom, David is good for me.

19:56.905 --> 19:58.532
You mean he's got money.

19:59.366 --> 20:01.118
I mean I'm in love with him.

20:07.541 --> 20:08.875
Can I see that again?

20:13.964 --> 20:15.716
Mm. Well...

20:17.175 --> 20:20.721
I just hope you've got a good plan
for telling your dad because this...

20:22.139 --> 20:23.557
is gonna kill him.

20:30.939 --> 20:34.776
Shh. It's okay. I'm right here.

20:35.819 --> 20:38.780
Everything's gonna be okay, Maureen.

20:38.864 --> 20:40.824
I'm gonna take care of you.

20:45.370 --> 20:48.832
Let's go, kids! Time to pull off stage
and leave this hellhole behind.

20:48.915 --> 20:51.209
- What's going on?
- The Feds are on our tail.

20:51.293 --> 20:53.962
Really?
- He means the bill collectors.

20:54.046 --> 20:55.547
Truck leaves in 15 minutes.

20:56.548 --> 20:58.800
No, there's not enough room
in the cab,

20:58.884 --> 21:01.845
so you guys are in for a real treat.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.513
You get to ride in the back.

21:03.597 --> 21:04.806
What?

21:04.890 --> 21:07.684
Hey,
it's not an ideal scenario for anyone,

21:07.768 --> 21:09.770
so we'll just try to make the best of it.

21:09.853 --> 21:12.356
It'll be kind of like
that road ride at the fair.

21:12.439 --> 21:14.149
Except without
any lights or oxygen.

21:14.232 --> 21:17.027
Oh, don't be so dramatic.
It'll be an adventure.

21:17.110 --> 21:21.198
- Be careful. There you go.

21:21.281 --> 21:22.741
Okay, scoot back.

21:24.618 --> 21:26.870
How long do
we have to be back here?

21:26.953 --> 21:29.714
Don't worry. This'll be the
last time you have to do this.

21:35.629 --> 21:38.298
Welcome
to the oldest mining town in Utah.

21:38.382 --> 21:40.842
- I thought that was the last town.
- Me too.

21:40.926 --> 21:42.803
That one was the oldest in Nevada.

21:43.804 --> 21:47.015
People been striking it rich
here for a hundred years.

21:47.099 --> 21:50.143
They must've moved somewhere else
to spend their fortune.

21:50.227 --> 21:52.938
It has a real frontier quality to it.

21:54.272 --> 21:56.400
Think we might be able
to stay here for a while?

21:56.983 --> 21:59.695
Mm, I got a good feeling about this one.

22:08.870 --> 22:10.330
I got it.

22:15.168 --> 22:19.715
The kids are tired of moving
to a new town every time you lose a job.

22:19.798 --> 22:21.591
They loved it in West Virginia.

22:24.344 --> 22:27.097
I just think it'd be good for them to see
where their daddy grew up.

22:29.015 --> 22:30.851
Mountain Goat, let go.

22:31.393 --> 22:32.894
Try floating a little.

22:35.355 --> 22:37.107
We're fine where we are.

22:37.899 --> 22:39.818
Taking showers at the public pool?

22:41.778 --> 22:43.739
I'll get the water turned on this weekend.

22:43.822 --> 22:45.991
You said that two months ago.

22:48.744 --> 22:50.787
Okay, Brian. Don't be shy.

22:50.871 --> 22:55.083
Everyone here is the same as us,
they've just got different complexions.

22:55.167 --> 22:57.711
Go on. Go play.

23:03.175 --> 23:07.053
If we went, your parents
can help us out with some money.

23:10.182 --> 23:12.058
I ain't moving back to Welch.

23:13.226 --> 23:14.686
What are you so afraid of?

23:17.397 --> 23:19.107
I ain't afraid of nothing.

23:21.109 --> 23:22.110
Hey!

23:22.694 --> 23:24.613
Quit clinging to the side!

23:35.248 --> 23:38.210
Yeah. Don't be scared. I gotcha.

23:41.046 --> 23:43.924
Yeah. Kick your legs.

23:44.841 --> 23:46.885
Yeah, it's not so hard.

23:47.803 --> 23:50.305
It's all about moving the water.

23:50.889 --> 23:52.182
Yup.

23:55.435 --> 23:57.062
Move your arms. Go ahead.

23:57.896 --> 24:00.607
Woo, in the water. Push the water.
Push it.

24:01.233 --> 24:03.735
Push it with your arms. That's good.

24:03.819 --> 24:05.362
It's not so bad, is it?

24:06.154 --> 24:09.115
Good. 'Cause you're gonna learn
to swim today.

24:09.950 --> 24:11.076
No!

24:17.165 --> 24:20.085
Catch your breath. Catch your breath.

24:20.627 --> 24:22.629
Oh, my goodness.

24:22.712 --> 24:25.257
All right. Breathe. Nice.

24:25.340 --> 24:27.092
- Why'd you do that?
- Okay.

24:28.343 --> 24:30.846
- Now, sink or swim.
- No!

24:44.234 --> 24:46.820
Rex!
- It's okay!

24:47.362 --> 24:49.155
She's already getting it.

24:49.906 --> 24:53.451
Pretty soon she's gonna
be doing the backstroke. Right?

24:53.535 --> 24:55.954
- No. I wanna go back.
- Yeah? Okay.

24:56.580 --> 24:57.998
- All right!
- Dad!

25:05.839 --> 25:07.424
You did it, baby!

25:07.507 --> 25:09.467
You were swimming!

25:10.218 --> 25:11.511
Hey!

25:12.637 --> 25:15.015
- Mountain Goat.
- Mister, you're wrong for that.

25:15.098 --> 25:16.492
Come on, kids. Let's go.

25:16.516 --> 25:19.060
No!
- Hey. Hey!

25:19.144 --> 25:21.271
Don't touch me!

25:21.354 --> 25:23.565
- You tried to kill me.
- Hey.

25:23.648 --> 25:26.359
I would never let anything bad
happen to you.

25:26.443 --> 25:30.405
But I can't let you cling to the side your
whole life just because you're scared.

25:31.239 --> 25:34.159
If you don't want to sink,
you have to learn how to swim.

25:34.242 --> 25:35.577
Understand?

25:37.245 --> 25:40.332
Hey, you were swimming.

25:40.415 --> 25:43.335
You were swimming. I'm so proud of you.

25:46.004 --> 25:48.798
Hey. Everything okay?

25:48.882 --> 25:51.551
She's fine. Mind your own damn business.

25:51.635 --> 25:54.137
What happens in my pool is my business.

25:54.220 --> 25:56.431
Oh, so this is your pool?

25:56.514 --> 25:58.266
As far as your concerned, yeah.

25:58.350 --> 26:02.062
Oh, so you're the one who limits the black
families to an hour in the mornings,

26:02.145 --> 26:04.272
so that the whites can swim
the rest of the day.

26:04.356 --> 26:06.942
That's been a federal offense since '64.

26:07.025 --> 26:10.362
Does he always act like this,
or just when he's drunk?

26:13.615 --> 26:15.033
Dad! No!

26:15.116 --> 26:15.992
- Dad, don't!
- Rex!

26:16.076 --> 26:19.120
I can't let you talk to me like that
in front of my daughter.

26:19.204 --> 26:21.289
- Let go! Stop
- I'm gonna tap him out.

26:21.373 --> 26:23.333
- Is that a tap? I couldn't tell.
- Dad! Let go!

26:23.416 --> 26:25.043
- Is that a tap?
- Rex!

26:25.126 --> 26:26.544
Will you stop?

26:26.628 --> 26:29.297
Come on, man!
- You're going to jail, asshole.

26:29.381 --> 26:31.967
Why you let him go?

26:36.513 --> 26:38.056
Get in the car.

26:40.100 --> 26:42.060
We're leaving with or without you.

26:42.477 --> 26:46.439
I'd rather be in hell with my back broke
than live in that godforsaken town.

26:46.523 --> 26:48.793
Yeah? You should have thought of that
before you got every

26:48.817 --> 26:50.694
policeman in town looking for us.

26:51.778 --> 26:53.905
I'm not gonna let them take our kids away.

26:53.989 --> 26:56.616
We cannot live like this anymore.

26:57.450 --> 27:00.245
Like what? This is freedom.

27:00.328 --> 27:03.331
Freedom? You call this freedom?

27:09.504 --> 27:10.964
Here we go.

27:13.925 --> 27:16.302
Welch is gonna be fun.

27:17.429 --> 27:20.890
We'll live in the mountains
with the squirrels and the chipmunks.

27:21.558 --> 27:24.602
And you'll get to meet your Grandma
and Grandpa Walls.

27:24.686 --> 27:27.897
Who are genuine hillbillies

27:31.609 --> 27:33.069
We don't need him.

27:46.124 --> 27:47.500
Rex!

27:49.377 --> 27:50.628
Come on, Dad!

27:52.881 --> 27:55.258
You're the head of this family!

28:17.530 --> 28:18.656
Are you coming?

28:19.574 --> 28:20.575
Negative.

28:22.994 --> 28:26.372
Mountain Goat, you know your...
your Mama has

28:26.456 --> 28:31.586
convinced you that we need to go
because she's in a state of fear.

28:32.087 --> 28:33.797
Now what you need to do

28:33.880 --> 28:36.091
is stand your ground.
You see, that's what I'm doing.

28:36.174 --> 28:37.926
This is a very important lesson for you.

28:40.220 --> 28:42.388
You don't look like
a very important lesson to me.

28:45.683 --> 28:46.810
Come on.

28:48.436 --> 28:50.188
Can I hold your ankle?

28:50.271 --> 28:51.397
No.

28:51.481 --> 28:53.108
Just for stability.

28:53.191 --> 28:55.193
I feel like I'm about to fall.

28:55.276 --> 28:57.570
You're on the ground already.

29:01.324 --> 29:03.493
All right, let's do it.

29:03.576 --> 29:04.786
I got him.

29:05.703 --> 29:07.038
He's alive.

29:07.122 --> 29:08.998
Oh, thank God.

29:11.459 --> 29:13.336
Oh, watch out. Don't squish Maureen.

29:16.422 --> 29:18.341
Move over, baby. I'm driving.

29:20.593 --> 29:22.053
Come here, give me some sugar.

29:22.137 --> 29:24.097
Oh, Rex.

29:24.806 --> 29:25.849
Jeannette.

29:27.350 --> 29:29.411
- Can I have another tissue, please?
- Oh, jeez, David.

29:29.435 --> 29:31.622
- I just... I need, I need another tissue.
- You're sweating through your shirt.

29:31.646 --> 29:33.332
Please don't point it out.
You know when you point it out

29:33.356 --> 29:35.334
- it only makes me sweat more.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

29:35.358 --> 29:37.235
You have nothing to be nervous about.

29:37.318 --> 29:39.279
Your dad already hates me.

29:39.362 --> 29:41.841
If he finds out we're getting married,
he's gonna throw me through a window.

29:41.865 --> 29:43.700
Hey, he's not gonna do that.

29:43.783 --> 29:45.535
He might kick you in the stomach though.

29:46.077 --> 29:47.412
It's too real to be funny.

29:47.495 --> 29:48.830
I know I'm just not there yet.

29:48.913 --> 29:50.039
Okay.

29:50.123 --> 29:52.101
He's gonna try to make me
to get drunk with him again.

29:52.125 --> 29:54.210
- No, he's not.
- You know he is.

29:54.294 --> 29:56.045
David, just tell him that
you don't want it.

29:56.129 --> 29:57.172
Well...

29:57.964 --> 29:59.382
Maybe, maybe I will do that.

29:59.465 --> 30:01.277
- Yeah, I'm not to be bullied by him.
- I know you're not.

30:01.301 --> 30:03.344
- I will not be bullied.
- Hey...

30:03.803 --> 30:05.763
- We're getting married.
- We are getting married.

30:05.805 --> 30:07.557
We can get through this. This is nothing.

30:07.640 --> 30:08.683
Okay.

30:11.019 --> 30:12.270
Hey, Dad.

30:15.815 --> 30:16.983
Oh, come on.

30:19.194 --> 30:20.737
Hey, Dad.

30:21.321 --> 30:24.365
Oh, so you're acknowledging
my existence now?

30:24.991 --> 30:27.660
Well you're not exactly
the easiest man to ignore.

30:30.788 --> 30:32.999
Well, I wanted to get this done
before you got here.

30:33.082 --> 30:37.712
I don't know who designed this junk,
but the mechanics are all wrong.

30:41.049 --> 30:42.383
Look at you.

30:43.593 --> 30:45.720
Fancier every time I see ya.

30:49.641 --> 30:51.559
It's good to see you, Mr. Walls.
How are you?

30:53.102 --> 30:56.397
Did you win that wet t-shirt contest?
Nice nips.

30:56.898 --> 30:58.816
- Cut it out.
- It was really hot in the car.

30:58.900 --> 31:00.193
It's the humidity.

31:00.276 --> 31:01.736
Humidity.

31:01.819 --> 31:05.406
Okay, just try not to drip
on my marble floor.

31:05.490 --> 31:08.701
Grab that toolbox
if it's not too much for you.

31:09.160 --> 31:10.286
Okay.

31:10.370 --> 31:13.581
Just finished hooking every squat
in the building to an insulated

31:13.665 --> 31:16.251
cable that hotwired it off
the utility pole down the block.

31:17.293 --> 31:19.773
Now the other squatters want to make me
the mayor of the place.

31:22.006 --> 31:24.342
Your mama's tradition of yellow door.

31:25.093 --> 31:26.844
Still gotta get hinges for this thing.

31:28.054 --> 31:29.305
This is my friend, Eddy.

31:29.389 --> 31:30.807
- Does he live here?
- Hello.

31:30.890 --> 31:33.059
Oh! There she is.

31:33.142 --> 31:36.062
- Hey, sweetie. How are ya?
- Oh, Mom.

31:37.981 --> 31:39.649
Look at that food.

31:39.732 --> 31:41.276
What a place.

31:41.359 --> 31:43.695
Anyone else feel like
they're back at Welch?

31:43.778 --> 31:46.131
I keep thinking we're gonna see
our yellow poop bucket somewhere here.

31:47.865 --> 31:49.492
Their bathroom's not that far off.

31:49.575 --> 31:52.578
Maureen!
- Yeah, she's our new roommate.

31:52.996 --> 31:55.164
I thought that you were living
with that photographer.

31:55.248 --> 31:56.582
That was months ago.

31:56.666 --> 31:59.127
And she just broke up
with Rum Tum Tugger from Cats.

31:59.210 --> 32:00.503
- What?
- Yeah.

32:00.586 --> 32:03.923
David, you get started on this
and I'll grab you dry shirt.

32:04.465 --> 32:06.676
- I'm okay. I'm not gonna drink tonight.
- Take it.

32:08.094 --> 32:09.094
Yes, sir.

32:09.887 --> 32:13.349
Rose Mary, grab a shirt for Jeannette's
sweaty boyfriend, will ya?

32:14.892 --> 32:16.769
So, did you hear Officer Walls

32:16.853 --> 32:19.147
- made his first arrest last week?
- What?

32:19.772 --> 32:20.857
Drug bust.

32:20.940 --> 32:23.234
Whoa, really? Was that scary?

32:23.318 --> 32:26.487
Look, he's got no hair. He's so cute.

32:26.571 --> 32:28.489
Do you wax or do you have alopecia?

32:29.991 --> 32:31.492
Not as scary as those two.

32:32.493 --> 32:33.786
What about you?

32:35.538 --> 32:36.998
Lori spilled the beans.

32:38.499 --> 32:40.877
- Lori.
- I'm sorry.

32:40.960 --> 32:43.755
Yeah, um, we are doing it.

32:46.090 --> 32:47.216
What?

32:48.217 --> 32:49.761
Why aren't you wearing the ring?

32:50.261 --> 32:52.597
Because I haven't told Dad yet.

32:52.680 --> 32:53.723
Told me what?

32:55.516 --> 32:57.977
That Brian made his first arrest.

32:58.061 --> 32:59.854
Oh, goodie.

32:59.937 --> 33:03.941
I got a son in the Gestapo
and a daughter who writes gossip.

33:04.025 --> 33:05.985
Never thought I'd see the day.

33:06.652 --> 33:08.780
Never thought
I'd see you living in New York.

33:08.863 --> 33:11.449
Well, somebody's gotta keep an eye on you.

33:12.617 --> 33:14.035
Have fun.

33:19.415 --> 33:22.293
Hey, Dad. Actually I have something that
I wanted to tell you.

33:22.377 --> 33:24.420
So how long is this phase gonna last?

33:25.505 --> 33:26.672
What do you mean?

33:26.756 --> 33:27.965
I mean...

33:28.758 --> 33:31.177
He's a nice guy and all,

33:31.260 --> 33:34.680
but he ain't got
an interesting bone in his body.

33:34.764 --> 33:36.599
- No.
- He's got no fight.

33:36.682 --> 33:39.018
David's not a phase, Dad.

33:39.769 --> 33:42.313
Which is what I'm...
I wanted to talk to you about.

33:42.397 --> 33:45.983
Can you honestly tell me
that you're happy right now?

33:46.901 --> 33:48.403
Yes, I am.

33:51.656 --> 33:53.699
No, you're not.

33:55.993 --> 33:58.663
Hopefully couple more of these
will loosen him up.

33:58.746 --> 34:01.374
Maybe that stick will fall out of his ass.

34:04.168 --> 34:05.920
David, here's your drink.

34:14.594 --> 34:18.266
Oh, give me land, lots of land

34:18.349 --> 34:20.435
Under starry skies above

34:20.518 --> 34:22.437
Welcome to Welch, everyone.

34:22.520 --> 34:24.188
Don't fence me in

34:25.565 --> 34:30.987
Let me ride through the wide open
country that I love

34:31.821 --> 34:34.657
Don't fence me in

34:35.533 --> 34:38.870
Gosh, things have gone downhill a bit.

34:40.413 --> 34:43.875
But I bet there's no other artist
to compete with.

34:46.335 --> 34:48.838
My career could really take off.

34:48.920 --> 34:51.047
ask you please

34:51.132 --> 34:53.842
Don't fence me in

35:36.427 --> 35:38.221
Welcome home, son.

35:40.890 --> 35:42.016
Hey there, Rex.

35:42.517 --> 35:43.768
Hey, Pops.

35:44.393 --> 35:47.271
Thanks for letting me
see my grandchildren before I die.

35:50.107 --> 35:51.901
This is your Uncle Stanley.

35:54.445 --> 35:55.488
Hi.

36:01.285 --> 36:03.621
All right. There you go.

36:06.290 --> 36:08.417
This one looks just like his daddy.

36:09.418 --> 36:11.587
Only his hair was more curly.

36:11.671 --> 36:13.631
You hated them curls, didn't you?

36:15.424 --> 36:18.427
Used to wet his hair down
and stand out in the snow.

36:18.511 --> 36:20.221
See if he could freeze 'em straight.

36:21.973 --> 36:23.766
Yeah, that's your daddy.

36:24.475 --> 36:26.102
Stubborn as a mule,

36:27.061 --> 36:28.354
dumb as a pigeon.

36:34.360 --> 36:35.486
- Ow!
- Hey!

36:35.945 --> 36:38.823
- Don't hit my brother, you dumb witch!
- Hey!

36:43.786 --> 36:45.579
Show your grandma some respect.

36:52.003 --> 36:53.796
You listen to your daddy, girl.

37:01.554 --> 37:03.764
That wasn't a good simile.

37:03.848 --> 37:06.684
Pigeons are very smart animals.

37:30.791 --> 37:31.792
Dad?

37:33.461 --> 37:35.171
- What are you doing?
- Hey.

37:36.672 --> 37:37.672
Oh...

37:40.885 --> 37:42.636
Putting in your spiral staircase.

37:44.513 --> 37:45.723
Wow.

37:47.266 --> 37:48.934
We're finally gonna build it.

37:51.062 --> 37:53.147
- Really?

37:53.230 --> 37:56.901
This is why we're here to...
It's our chance to start over.

38:01.822 --> 38:05.451
First thing tomorrow
I'm gonna search this whole town

38:05.534 --> 38:08.454
for the perfect place
to lay our foundation.

38:15.628 --> 38:18.047
We're getting the hell out of here.

38:21.675 --> 38:24.887
Now, it's not exactly palatial,

38:25.387 --> 38:27.431
it will be a lot of togetherness.

38:28.808 --> 38:30.810
And it's a little on the rustic side.

38:31.769 --> 38:33.437
How rustic?

38:33.521 --> 38:35.773
Welcome to 93 Little Hobart Street.

38:36.982 --> 38:40.236
Fifty bucks a week and in two years
we'll own her outright.

38:40.319 --> 38:42.696
Hard to believe one day this'll be ours.

38:42.780 --> 38:46.867
Hey, she may not look like much.
Wait till you see what I have in mind.

38:47.409 --> 38:48.577
Come on.

38:50.454 --> 38:54.375
We're gonna tear all this down
and replace it with your game room.

38:54.458 --> 38:56.377
Ping-pong, pool, foosball.

38:56.460 --> 38:57.460
Trampoline?

38:57.503 --> 39:00.256
Oh yeah, trampoline goes right over there
and then uh,

39:00.339 --> 39:04.593
all these walls are gone, replaced
with three-inch glass, glass, glass.

39:04.677 --> 39:08.055
- This can stay.
- Doesn't that look lovely?

39:08.639 --> 39:11.100
Yellow stands for happiness and
creativity.

39:11.183 --> 39:14.061
This place doesn't have
any running water or electricity.

39:14.728 --> 39:16.981
Ignore her. She was born without vision.

39:18.065 --> 39:21.819
Since we're on the north facing
the mountain enclosed by these two hills,

39:21.902 --> 39:23.195
we ain't getting much sun.

39:23.279 --> 39:27.825
So I have to do some serious reconfiguring
to increase the size of our solar cells.

39:27.908 --> 39:31.829
But before any of that can happen,
we need a good foundation.

39:32.872 --> 39:34.957
- Pick.
- Yes, sir.

39:35.040 --> 39:36.292
- Good man.
- Here.

39:37.501 --> 39:40.629
Yah! Make some noise, kids,
make some noise.

39:40.713 --> 39:44.091
- Yah!
- Yah! Yah!

39:44.175 --> 39:47.553
For just one stardust stone

39:47.636 --> 39:51.015
Sleepin' innocent below

39:51.098 --> 39:55.019
But they'll run when
the warm rain comes

39:55.102 --> 39:58.105
Roaring with the thunder

39:58.189 --> 40:01.692
- I'll rise up from the murky mud

40:01.775 --> 40:04.778
When the summer storm begins the flood

40:04.862 --> 40:07.072
- Oh shit. Kids?

40:07.156 --> 40:12.745
Let me go
They don't recognize a precious stone

40:12.828 --> 40:16.290
I'll lay low 'til the wet wind blows

40:16.373 --> 40:19.710
Take me tumblin' down the road

40:19.793 --> 40:23.881
The wood vines make it hard to fly

40:23.964 --> 40:27.176
The anchor holds my rope down

40:27.259 --> 40:30.262
No use tryin' to make it out alive

40:30.346 --> 40:33.599
And like a summer storm
I've gotta roam

40:43.025 --> 40:46.362
Once it's deep enough,
I can pour the slab and

40:47.279 --> 40:49.615
we can start framing this damn thing.

40:52.201 --> 40:54.286
We're gonna have
the nicest house in the county.

40:55.788 --> 40:58.207
You ain't just whistling Dixie there,
little lady.

40:58.290 --> 41:02.461
You know, we got the highest property
on the mountain.

41:02.544 --> 41:06.090
Which means that the heat
can't burn us during the summer,

41:06.173 --> 41:08.259
and the floods can't touch us
in the winter.

41:10.219 --> 41:12.846
We're just gliding in between
all those streams.

41:16.350 --> 41:18.190
Things are gonna be different
this time around.

41:34.410 --> 41:35.911
I'm hungry.

41:50.175 --> 41:51.468
Try it.

41:54.972 --> 41:56.056
Good?

41:59.018 --> 42:00.269
What are you eating?

42:00.811 --> 42:02.021
Butter and sugar.

42:05.316 --> 42:06.692
Taste kind of like frosting.

42:10.487 --> 42:12.531
We haven't eaten in three days.

42:12.614 --> 42:14.742
Maureen's so hungry, she's eating butter!

42:14.992 --> 42:17.745
You ate the butter?
I was saving that for the bread.

42:17.828 --> 42:19.246
We have no bread!

42:19.330 --> 42:22.041
Well, I was thinking of baking some.

42:22.124 --> 42:23.917
The gas is turned off.

42:24.001 --> 42:25.627
What if it gets turned back on?

42:26.211 --> 42:27.546
Miracles happen, you know?

42:27.629 --> 42:29.006
We're hungry!

42:29.089 --> 42:30.591
Hey, watch that tone, girl.

42:32.343 --> 42:34.023
You said things
were going to be different.

42:36.138 --> 42:41.935
Can't we just get some eggs...
or beans or something?

42:42.478 --> 42:43.896
Nothing fancy.

42:47.900 --> 42:49.276
I don't see why not.

42:52.279 --> 42:53.322
What you got?

43:03.832 --> 43:05.584
How about the other one?

43:09.713 --> 43:14.343
Okay, I'll be back in an hour with a feast
you can tell your children about.

43:15.010 --> 43:16.345
Your children's children.

43:16.762 --> 43:18.972
Children's children's children.

43:19.681 --> 43:24.019
And their children's children's children's
children's children's children's...

43:32.486 --> 43:36.240
He probably just
got stuck talking to someone.

43:37.032 --> 43:38.117
For ten hours?

43:50.587 --> 43:53.507
Oh lord.

43:58.762 --> 43:59.763
Dad?

44:02.057 --> 44:03.684
Hey, kiddo.

44:04.560 --> 44:05.978
What are you doing up?

44:07.271 --> 44:08.605
What happened?

44:10.190 --> 44:13.735
Oh, I got into a fight with the mountain.

44:15.028 --> 44:16.280
Mountain won.

44:21.160 --> 44:23.537
Dad, that looks really bad.

44:23.620 --> 44:26.415
Yeah. That don't look good.

44:28.542 --> 44:29.793
What can I do?

44:39.636 --> 44:41.138
Don't worry about me.

44:42.264 --> 44:45.476
I'm so thoroughly pickled...

44:46.727 --> 44:48.228
I won't feel a thing.

44:50.355 --> 44:51.482
Here.

44:58.655 --> 45:00.157
Okay, go ahead.

45:09.666 --> 45:11.793
- Go on.
- I can't do it.

45:13.045 --> 45:14.213
I'm sorry.

45:14.296 --> 45:16.924
It's okay. It's all right.

45:17.549 --> 45:19.593
We'll do it together, okay?

45:20.844 --> 45:22.930
It's all right. Come here.

45:24.014 --> 45:25.807
Squeeze it together.

45:26.391 --> 45:29.728
That's it. Now, push it through.

45:30.395 --> 45:32.147
Yeah. Ah...

45:32.231 --> 45:34.691
Good. Just push it right through.

45:36.985 --> 45:38.278
Good.

45:39.071 --> 45:41.907
Oh, that's good. Brave.

45:42.574 --> 45:44.409
You are amazing.

45:45.786 --> 45:47.287
Ah...

45:47.371 --> 45:49.498
- Okay.
- Push it right through. Go on.

45:49.581 --> 45:52.292
That's it. Yeah.

45:53.460 --> 45:56.380
Oh, my God, that's beautiful. Oh, jeez.

45:56.463 --> 46:00.300
You don't have to tug quite so hard on it.
It's not like tug of war.

46:02.928 --> 46:03.804
Okay.

46:03.887 --> 46:05.931
And one more. That's good.

46:07.099 --> 46:08.099
Wow.

46:09.601 --> 46:11.728
That's some mighty fine handiwork.

46:18.944 --> 46:23.198
I swear... at times I think that...

46:24.157 --> 46:26.159
you're the only one around...

46:27.536 --> 46:29.538
that still has any faith in me.

46:34.167 --> 46:37.254
You know I'd do anything for you, right?

46:38.380 --> 46:39.548
Anything.

46:40.424 --> 46:42.259
All you got to do is ask.

46:53.770 --> 46:54.938
Do you think...

47:01.570 --> 47:04.740
you could maybe stop drinking?

47:08.410 --> 47:13.957
It's just... when you drink,
you can't take care of us.

47:25.886 --> 47:28.305
You must be awfully ashamed
of your old man.

47:29.973 --> 47:31.016
No.

47:34.436 --> 47:36.605
I'd just think we'd have money for food.

47:38.815 --> 47:41.318
Maybe even some extra
for the glass castle.

47:46.114 --> 47:47.908
You can do it if you want.

47:50.786 --> 47:52.454
You're stronger than anyone.

48:04.883 --> 48:06.885
Well, if you don't mind, honey, I...

48:09.846 --> 48:11.640
I'd figure I'd like to just...

48:14.768 --> 48:16.686
sit here by myself for a while.

48:52.347 --> 48:53.515
Dad?

48:57.978 --> 48:59.771
For the next few days

48:59.855 --> 49:03.567
I'm gonna be keeping to myself from
upstairs and

49:04.401 --> 49:05.652
I uh...

49:06.736 --> 49:09.322
I need you kids to steer clear of me.

49:09.906 --> 49:14.161
Take your brother and sisters outside,
do something fun, okay?

49:16.329 --> 49:19.291
And no matter what happens...

49:20.459 --> 49:24.546
If I ask for a drink,
you can't let anyone give me one.

49:26.840 --> 49:27.841
Not a drop.

49:28.967 --> 49:30.010
Okay?

49:31.094 --> 49:32.512
Can you do that for me?

49:34.264 --> 49:35.390
Yeah.

49:35.474 --> 49:36.683
You promise?

49:42.481 --> 49:43.899
That's a good girl.

49:46.067 --> 49:48.507
Do you think we can start
building the new house soon?

49:49.696 --> 49:50.947
Probably.

49:54.576 --> 49:56.077
Help me!

50:05.128 --> 50:09.799
- Oh, God! Make it stop!
- Shh.

50:09.883 --> 50:12.219
- It's okay.
- Please, make it stop!

50:12.302 --> 50:15.472
- Just breathe, honey.
- Rose Mary!

50:15.555 --> 50:19.309
- God, help me!
- Shh. It's okay, it's okay.

50:20.227 --> 50:23.522
No... Help!

50:25.315 --> 50:28.360
- No...
- Help me! Please...

50:31.905 --> 50:33.907
Mountain Goat!

50:40.539 --> 50:41.581
Dad...

50:45.460 --> 50:47.003
Mountain Goat.

50:48.588 --> 50:49.798
Please...

50:51.007 --> 50:52.384
give me a drink.

50:54.803 --> 50:56.555
I'll get you some water.

50:56.638 --> 50:58.306
No, no, no.

50:58.890 --> 51:02.852
There's some whiskey under the sink.

51:02.936 --> 51:05.647
Go fetch it for me.

51:10.694 --> 51:11.903
Jeannette...

51:13.905 --> 51:15.365
I'm dying.

51:16.366 --> 51:20.495
If you don't give me a drink,
I'm gonna die.

51:20.996 --> 51:23.999
That is a scientific fact.

51:24.082 --> 51:25.667
Understand?

51:25.750 --> 51:30.589
You want me to die?
Do you want your daddy to die?

51:32.382 --> 51:33.967
I can't, Dad.

51:35.051 --> 51:36.469
I promised too.

51:36.553 --> 51:39.848
I don't care about your stupid promise!

51:39.931 --> 51:42.809
Go get me a drink right now!

51:42.892 --> 51:45.687
Jeannette, go get me a drink!

51:46.521 --> 51:48.064
Jeannette!

52:04.623 --> 52:06.708
Foundation looks pretty good.

52:07.500 --> 52:09.085
We're almost ready to start building.

52:13.632 --> 52:16.509
I've missed you.
- I've missed you too.

52:20.555 --> 52:22.182
How 'bout that?

52:28.772 --> 52:30.523
Oh, look at that.

52:30.607 --> 52:36.071
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree

52:36.154 --> 52:41.368
Forever true your color

52:41.451 --> 52:44.496
O Christmas tree...

52:45.455 --> 52:47.499
Dad's leaving for work!

52:48.792 --> 52:51.419
Stop. I can't put your hat on.

52:51.503 --> 52:55.090
All right,
make sure it ain't faulty.

52:55.840 --> 52:59.094
Ow, ow, ow. Okay, okay, okay. It's fine.

52:59.761 --> 53:02.114
- Oh, thanks, Bill. Merry Christmas.
- Good evening, Rex.

53:02.138 --> 53:04.391
- Merry Christmas, ladies.
- You too.

53:04.474 --> 53:06.434
The foreman forgot his toolbox

53:06.518 --> 53:11.481
and so I had to use this macaroni noodle
to insulate these cross wires

53:11.564 --> 53:14.818
and now I got every damn person
at work telling me

53:14.901 --> 53:17.278
that I really know how to use my noodle.

53:24.160 --> 53:28.623
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree

53:28.707 --> 53:32.419
I couldn't find a good one for you,
so you'll just have to write your own.

53:34.087 --> 53:36.798
Careful, you might change the world
with that thing.

53:36.881 --> 53:40.844
...All place faithfully

53:40.927 --> 53:46.850
Our trust in God unchangingly

53:46.933 --> 53:52.981
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree

53:53.064 --> 53:56.067
How sturdy God

53:56.151 --> 54:02.240
Hath made thee

54:02.824 --> 54:04.325
It's so pretty.

54:04.868 --> 54:06.453
And beautiful.

54:08.705 --> 54:12.417
Rich city folk live in fancy apartments.

54:12.500 --> 54:16.546
But their air is so polluted,
they can't even see the stars.

54:18.506 --> 54:22.761
We'd have to be out of our minds
to trade places with any of them.

54:26.681 --> 54:28.850
Go on, pick out your favorite one.

54:30.018 --> 54:31.478
It's yours for keeps.

54:32.729 --> 54:34.272
You can't give me a star.

54:35.774 --> 54:37.275
It's your Christmas present.

54:39.861 --> 54:42.071
No one owns the stars.

54:42.739 --> 54:46.993
Well, that's why you've got to claim 'em
before anyone else does.

54:47.660 --> 54:51.456
Like uh, Columbus claimed America
for Queen Isabella.

54:52.207 --> 54:54.793
Claiming a star for your own
has just as much logic.

54:56.002 --> 55:00.632
Maybe more 'cause you don't have to kill
and subjugate millions of people to do it.

55:01.424 --> 55:03.343
So go ahead and pick out anyone you want.

55:03.426 --> 55:06.471
Except for Beetlejuice and Rigel
because uh,

55:07.222 --> 55:09.849
Lori and Brian already laid claim to them.

55:13.812 --> 55:15.188
I want that one.

55:15.772 --> 55:17.212
The bright one?
- Yeah.

55:18.149 --> 55:20.443
That's Venus. She's a planet.

55:20.527 --> 55:23.363
Kind of dinky compared to real stars.

55:23.446 --> 55:26.282
She just looks brighter
'cause she's close to us.

55:29.869 --> 55:31.454
I like it anyway.

55:33.414 --> 55:37.502
What the hell, it's Christmas.
You can have a planet if you want.

55:39.587 --> 55:42.465
You know her atmosphere's
a lot like the Earth's,

55:42.549 --> 55:45.969
only uh, 500 degrees hotter.

55:46.553 --> 55:47.554
- Really?
- Yeah.

55:47.637 --> 55:52.433
So when the sun starts to burn out
and the Earth turns cold.

55:52.517 --> 55:55.270
Everyone might want to move to
Venus to get warm,

55:55.353 --> 55:58.165
and now they're gonna have to get
permission from your descendants first.

56:08.700 --> 56:10.743
You know, I love you, kid.

56:10.827 --> 56:12.287
I love you more.

56:32.473 --> 56:34.517
I really like David.

56:35.894 --> 56:38.354
- You really what?
- Yeah.

56:38.438 --> 56:40.356
He's not that boring

56:40.440 --> 56:43.902
I think he'd be a nice addition
to the family.

56:45.361 --> 56:48.448
Oh, by the way, I just found out

56:48.531 --> 56:51.618
my brother's planning to sell
his half of Mom's land.

56:51.701 --> 56:54.412
- Uncle Jim?
- Yup and it's a real shame.

56:54.495 --> 56:56.497
My father always taught me you never...

56:56.581 --> 56:58.249
Free market my ass.

56:58.333 --> 57:01.085
The whole thing is a rigged game
and you know it.

57:01.169 --> 57:05.673
It's a system created by all you fat cats
to make yourselves richer

57:05.757 --> 57:07.675
and keep the poor where they are.

57:07.759 --> 57:10.261
It's nothing more than legalized larceny

57:10.345 --> 57:12.585
- Admit it, David.
- Well, on behalf of all the fat cats,

57:12.639 --> 57:14.617
I'm not going to admit
to something that's not true.

57:14.641 --> 57:16.351
- David.
- Jeannette, it's fine.

57:16.434 --> 57:18.853
- We're just, we're just talking.
- Yeah, we're just talking.

57:18.937 --> 57:21.898
You know what, Rex?
Let's just agree to disagree.

57:21.981 --> 57:26.402
On behalf of the 90 percent in our country
working for 4.75 an hour,

57:26.486 --> 57:28.112
I will do no such thing.

57:28.196 --> 57:30.073
Now very noble of you.

57:30.156 --> 57:32.200
A real champion of the people.

57:32.283 --> 57:33.451
How drunk are you?

57:33.534 --> 57:36.454
How 'bout we settle this
the way they did in ancient Rome,

57:36.537 --> 57:39.290
with a good ol' fashion
arm wrestling match?

57:39.374 --> 57:41.310
Pretty sure that's not something
they did in Rome.

57:41.334 --> 57:42.627
Dad, enough.

57:42.710 --> 57:45.880
Come on, Mountain Goat.
David was gonna fight for your honor.

57:45.964 --> 57:48.007
- This is ridiculous.
- Yes.

57:48.091 --> 57:50.468
It's ridiculous. We are going home.

57:50.551 --> 57:53.721
What? You're giving up already?

57:54.305 --> 57:57.976
You gonna just wander out of here
with your tail between your legs?

58:00.812 --> 58:03.564
I'm not gonna arm wrestle you.

58:03.648 --> 58:05.775
Oh, okay. So you admit it.

58:05.858 --> 58:07.694
I'm right and you're wrong.

58:11.239 --> 58:13.199
Okay.

58:14.325 --> 58:16.035
- What the hell?
- Attaboy!

58:16.119 --> 58:19.288
No, David.

58:19.372 --> 58:21.874
- This is a bad idea.
- Babe, it's gonna be fun.

58:21.958 --> 58:24.544
- Babe, it's gonna be fun.
- Babe, it's gonna be fun.

58:24.627 --> 58:26.212
Dad, please.

58:26.295 --> 58:29.090
Come on. Don't you want to give him
a chance to prove me wrong?

58:29.674 --> 58:32.552
Yes. Jeannette, let me prove him wrong.

58:35.054 --> 58:36.973
Okay. You guys want to be idiots?

58:37.056 --> 58:39.767
All right. Here we go!

58:39.851 --> 58:41.787
- Rex, come on.
- Put 'em up!

58:41.811 --> 58:43.691
- All right.
- Let's do it.

58:43.771 --> 58:46.065
- Ready! Set!
- Straighten up.

58:47.608 --> 58:49.569
- Go! Come on, David!
- Come on, Rex!

58:49.652 --> 58:50.963
- Yay, yay. Come on!
- Come on, David.

58:50.987 --> 58:54.091
- David, you got this. David, push!
- Come on, Rex. Come on.

58:54.115 --> 58:55.575
How does that feel, boy?

58:55.658 --> 58:57.136
Come on, David. Come on!

58:59.537 --> 59:01.748
You're gonna lose to an old man.

59:01.831 --> 59:03.916
Come on, honey.
Bring it home, bring it home!

59:04.000 --> 59:06.586
Let out the wild man, come on, Rex!

59:06.669 --> 59:09.380
David, come on. You're stronger than this.

59:09.464 --> 59:11.859
- Come on, let's go, David.
- Let the wild man go!

59:11.883 --> 59:13.843
What did I tell ya? No fight.

59:15.261 --> 59:18.181
Go on, David, kick his ass!

59:18.264 --> 59:19.515
Take him down!

59:19.599 --> 59:23.102
Murder him! Murder him, David!

59:23.186 --> 59:25.786
Let's go, David. Bring him down. Come on!

59:25.813 --> 59:28.232
Rex, don't lose this! Come on!

59:28.316 --> 59:31.027
You're better than this, you bastard!
Take him down!

59:31.110 --> 59:32.195
Take him down!

59:35.448 --> 59:37.575
Go, go, go, go, go!

59:44.123 --> 59:46.793
Dow Jones will live to see another day!

59:47.460 --> 59:49.087
Left-handed rematch.

59:49.670 --> 59:51.172
I wanted a left-handed rematch.

59:51.255 --> 59:54.675
- No, Dad, don't be a sore loser.
- Left-handed rematch.

59:54.759 --> 59:57.637
I'm ready for whatever
you want to throw at me, old man.

59:57.720 --> 59:59.013
- Oh!

59:59.097 --> 01:00:00.515
What the hell, Dad?

01:00:00.598 --> 01:00:02.118
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, shit.

01:00:03.267 --> 01:00:05.061
Well, you heard that man. I mean he said

01:00:05.144 --> 01:00:07.313
he was ready for whatever
I wanted to throw at him.

01:00:07.396 --> 01:00:10.066
- I think he broke my nose.
- It's not my fault.

01:00:10.149 --> 01:00:12.110
I have a soldier's reflex.

01:00:12.193 --> 01:00:14.654
I seriously thought you were ready.

01:00:14.737 --> 01:00:17.532
Tell your boyfriend that
he needs to be careful

01:00:17.615 --> 01:00:19.283
about saying things he doesn't mean.

01:00:20.034 --> 01:00:22.203
He's not my boyfriend, Dad.

01:00:22.286 --> 01:00:23.663
He's my fiancÃ©.

01:00:25.706 --> 01:00:27.208
Let's get you home.

01:00:29.836 --> 01:00:32.397
It's not stopping, I don't know where all
the blood is coming from.

01:00:32.421 --> 01:00:33.714
And please, I don't want that.

01:00:35.383 --> 01:00:37.593
Why do you still have all
these stupid boxes?

01:00:37.677 --> 01:00:40.805
David, you're drunk. Just drink some water
and let's go to bed.

01:00:40.888 --> 01:00:42.741
- He punched me in the face, Jeannette.
- I know.

01:00:42.765 --> 01:00:43.933
You told me not to worry

01:00:44.016 --> 01:00:46.352
and then he punched me
right in the middle of the face.

01:00:46.435 --> 01:00:48.729
And everybody was shouting.
It was so loud.

01:00:48.813 --> 01:00:51.607
And you screamed at me,
you said, "Murder him!"

01:00:51.691 --> 01:00:54.235
You shouted it right into my ear,
like a madwoman.

01:00:54.318 --> 01:00:57.029
- Please just drink some water.
- This is serious, Jeannette.

01:00:57.113 --> 01:01:00.158
Your dad is a total nut-job.

01:01:00.241 --> 01:01:02.326
Hey, I can call him that. Not you.

01:01:02.410 --> 01:01:03.786
Your mom is delusional.

01:01:03.870 --> 01:01:06.372
Poor Maureen,
she's got to be out of her mind

01:01:06.455 --> 01:01:08.433
that she's choosing to live in
that dump with them.

01:01:08.457 --> 01:01:10.877
This is my family that
you are talking about.

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:13.796
I know, and they are totally insane.

01:01:33.566 --> 01:01:34.984
Jeannette, I...

01:01:36.611 --> 01:01:39.155
I want to spend
the rest of my life with you,

01:01:39.238 --> 01:01:41.532
but if we're gonna try
and do that together...

01:01:43.201 --> 01:01:48.039
I can't have any more
of whatever that was tonight.

01:01:58.049 --> 01:01:59.800
I gotta, I gotta go pee.

01:02:01.844 --> 01:02:03.179
I'm gonna pee.

01:02:11.604 --> 01:02:14.232
Don't worry,
it's about a 20-hour drive to Texas.

01:02:14.315 --> 01:02:17.401
I can do it in under 15.
We'll be back before you know it.

01:02:17.485 --> 01:02:19.237
How did Grandma Smith die?

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:22.531
My mother was an old woman.
Old woman die.

01:02:22.615 --> 01:02:23.950
Did she leave you anything?

01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:26.452
What kind of a question is that?

01:02:26.535 --> 01:02:27.995
Why can't we come with you?

01:02:28.079 --> 01:02:29.622
I don't want to stay with Erma.

01:02:30.539 --> 01:02:32.667
Your dad hasn't had a drink in two months.

01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:34.877
I think we deserve a little vacation.

01:02:34.961 --> 01:02:36.420
But Erma hates us.

01:02:36.504 --> 01:02:39.298
Don't blame her for her misery,
it's all she knows.

01:02:39.382 --> 01:02:40.800
She's a dumb witch.

01:02:40.883 --> 01:02:43.010
Actually, she's very smart.

01:02:43.094 --> 01:02:45.221
That's where your dad gets it from.

01:02:45.304 --> 01:02:48.182
He painted a self-portrait
with a bandaged ear.

01:02:48.266 --> 01:02:49.100
Van Gogh.

01:02:49.183 --> 01:02:50.827
- Who is van Gogh?
- That's right.

01:02:50.851 --> 01:02:52.561
You eat what I put on your plate.

01:02:52.645 --> 01:02:54.647
If you spit that out,
you're gonna eat that too.

01:02:54.730 --> 01:02:57.817
No running in the house.
No shouting. No whining.

01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:00.695
No opening the windows or the curtains.

01:03:00.778 --> 01:03:01.821
Edgar Bergen.

01:03:01.904 --> 01:03:03.984
- Who is Edgar Bergen.
- Edgar Bergen is right.

01:03:08.577 --> 01:03:11.372
It's so weird that Dad lived here
when he was our age.

01:03:12.373 --> 01:03:14.250
Yeah, I thought we had it bad.

01:03:16.794 --> 01:03:18.129
Look at this.

01:03:26.846 --> 01:03:29.015
You think Dad really wrote all this?

01:03:30.266 --> 01:03:31.517
Listen to this.

01:03:32.852 --> 01:03:35.855
"There might be more than
this blanket of black dust.

01:03:36.605 --> 01:03:40.609
The stench of the tug,
the crunch of the coal-stained snow.

01:03:41.527 --> 01:03:45.740
More than the sound of her cackle,
the cracks in her callused hands.

01:03:46.615 --> 01:03:49.618
There might be more but I won't ever know

01:03:49.702 --> 01:03:52.747
because it's impossible to breathe when
you're drowning in..."

01:03:54.665 --> 01:03:55.875
he cusses.

01:04:00.212 --> 01:04:03.424
"It's impossible to breathe when
you're drowning in shit."

01:04:06.719 --> 01:04:08.888
Keep it down!

01:04:10.139 --> 01:04:11.974
This is gonna be a fun week.

01:04:20.649 --> 01:04:21.901
You bring a sharpener?

01:04:22.526 --> 01:04:24.320
Yeah, in my bag downstairs.

01:04:35.122 --> 01:04:37.500
No, Erma. Please.

01:04:37.583 --> 01:04:39.710
- You do what I tell you.
- Stop it.

01:04:39.794 --> 01:04:43.589
Just be quiet, boy.
- Stop it. Stop it.

01:04:43.672 --> 01:04:45.883
I'm just going to... Hold still.
- Hey!

01:04:47.301 --> 01:04:48.511
Get away from him!

01:04:48.594 --> 01:04:49.929
Lori!

01:04:50.012 --> 01:04:52.973
The boys britches needed fixing.

01:04:53.057 --> 01:04:55.810
I know what I saw. She's a pervert.

01:04:55.893 --> 01:04:57.478
- Little bitch.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:04:57.561 --> 01:04:58.938
Let's just calm down, okay?

01:05:07.196 --> 01:05:08.823
Come help me! Hold her down!

01:05:08.906 --> 01:05:11.492
Get the hell off of me, you little beasts.

01:05:11.951 --> 01:05:14.370
Nobody messes
with our brother!

01:05:14.453 --> 01:05:16.580
Stanley. Get them off me.

01:05:16.664 --> 01:05:19.750
Put me down!

01:05:37.017 --> 01:05:38.018
Dad.

01:05:38.894 --> 01:05:40.855
We were just protecting ourselves.

01:05:42.481 --> 01:05:44.233
- Erma was grabbing his...
- Shut up!

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:50.239
I don't want to hear another damn word
about whatever did or didn't happen!

01:05:52.116 --> 01:05:53.409
It don't matter!

01:05:55.870 --> 01:05:58.539
Brian's a man,
he can take care of himself!

01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:00.624
Can't you?

01:06:05.045 --> 01:06:06.255
Let's go.

01:06:22.438 --> 01:06:24.064
Are you coming?

01:06:33.616 --> 01:06:35.451
Come on, kids, let's go inside.

01:06:38.454 --> 01:06:40.498
Come on, guys, let's go.

01:06:42.166 --> 01:06:43.166
Come on.

01:06:56.722 --> 01:06:57.973
Get out.

01:07:01.519 --> 01:07:03.479
Not if you're gonna drink.

01:07:06.190 --> 01:07:07.650
You promised.

01:07:29.797 --> 01:07:31.298
I'm not going.

01:07:33.592 --> 01:07:36.053
I'm not going. I don't want to...

01:07:37.304 --> 01:07:40.057
Stop! Dad...

01:07:52.236 --> 01:07:54.154
I don't want to see him drunk.

01:07:56.532 --> 01:07:58.450
See what you do?

01:07:59.743 --> 01:08:01.579
It was one damn drink!

01:08:01.662 --> 01:08:03.056
That's a lie and you know it.

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:04.915
- I can smell it on your sweat.
- Come on.

01:08:04.999 --> 01:08:07.159
What are you,
a bloodhound all of a sudden?

01:08:07.209 --> 01:08:09.503
Why don't you go sniff
your own butt for a change

01:08:09.587 --> 01:08:11.273
'cause that ain't smelling too pretty
these days.

01:08:11.297 --> 01:08:13.578
That's very funny.
You're supposed to be at work right now

01:08:13.632 --> 01:08:14.967
or you're gonna lose another job!

01:08:15.050 --> 01:08:19.388
Well, why don't you go get a job instead
of wasting your time on all this crap?

01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:21.180
What the hell is this anyway?

01:08:21.265 --> 01:08:23.392
Abstract expressionism!

01:08:23.475 --> 01:08:25.978
Well, here's some realism for you!

01:08:29.398 --> 01:08:31.609
You're just like your mother.

01:08:39.033 --> 01:08:40.533
Don't you touch me!

01:08:40.618 --> 01:08:43.495
Get back here, you castrating whore.

01:08:43.578 --> 01:08:44.705
Hands off me!

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:46.808
- Come here.
- Get off of me!

01:08:49.042 --> 01:08:51.377
- Maureen, you want to jump rope?
- Yeah.

01:08:53.464 --> 01:08:54.631
Come on.

01:08:57.176 --> 01:08:59.386
- Ready?
- Get set. Go.

01:09:03.682 --> 01:09:05.827
- Come on. Get up here!
- Help!

01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:08.228
Goddammit
Mom! Hold on!

01:09:17.154 --> 01:09:20.032
- Help! Help me!
- Mom!

01:09:20.115 --> 01:09:22.283
- Help! Don't help me!
- Mom.

01:09:22.368 --> 01:09:25.120
- Don't let her fall!
- What did you do to her?

01:09:25.203 --> 01:09:26.997
I didn't do anything!

01:09:27.081 --> 01:09:28.582
Get your hands off me!

01:09:28.666 --> 01:09:30.917
I don't think you want me to let go. Ow!

01:09:31.001 --> 01:09:33.045
She bit me!
- Just pull me in.

01:09:33.127 --> 01:09:34.587
Goddammit!

01:09:35.964 --> 01:09:37.883
He's trying to kill me!

01:09:39.051 --> 01:09:41.291
- Mom, are you okay?
- I'm okay.

01:09:41.970 --> 01:09:45.099
What do you mean is she okay?
Am I okay? She just bit me.

01:09:45.474 --> 01:09:47.059
Why did you push her?

01:09:47.142 --> 01:09:50.813
I didn't push her! She jumped!
I swear to God!

01:09:50.895 --> 01:09:54.942
You know she's crazy! You saw
she just bit me. I think she's broken...

01:09:57.027 --> 01:09:58.195
Hey.

01:10:21.135 --> 01:10:23.345
You are one hell of a woman.

01:10:23.429 --> 01:10:24.763
You know that?

01:10:24.847 --> 01:10:28.267
And you're a stinky rotten drunk.

01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:31.770
But you love the stinky rotten drunk,
don't you?

01:10:33.439 --> 01:10:35.023
Oh, Rex.

01:10:49.079 --> 01:10:50.122
Hey, sweetie.

01:10:56.170 --> 01:10:57.921
You have to leave him.

01:11:07.723 --> 01:11:10.517
You know,
when your dad first met my mother,

01:11:10.601 --> 01:11:13.604
he asked her why she didn't have any
of my paintings on her walls.

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:17.775
And she said she didn't want to encourage
a hobby with no future in it.

01:11:19.401 --> 01:11:22.780
He looked her right in the eye
and said, "To hell with the future.

01:11:22.863 --> 01:11:26.116
Masterpieces like these should be
on display right now."

01:11:32.122 --> 01:11:35.459
So he took down all other paintings.

01:11:36.877 --> 01:11:38.086
And put up mine.

01:11:42.633 --> 01:11:44.635
He's never going to change.

01:11:48.555 --> 01:11:50.224
You have to leave him.

01:12:01.568 --> 01:12:02.778
I can't.

01:12:13.330 --> 01:12:15.499
Maureen, do you have any queens?

01:12:15.582 --> 01:12:16.583
Go fish.

01:12:18.710 --> 01:12:21.338
Brian, do you have any nines?

01:12:22.422 --> 01:12:23.423
Go fish.

01:12:24.591 --> 01:12:26.051
We don't need them.

01:12:29.137 --> 01:12:32.766
They're never going to take care of us,
so we have to do it ourselves.

01:12:33.851 --> 01:12:36.395
We'll all go to school,
and start saving up

01:12:36.478 --> 01:12:38.118
so we can move out when we're old enough.

01:12:40.065 --> 01:12:42.025
If we're going to make it out of this,

01:12:42.109 --> 01:12:44.236
we have to do it together.

01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:46.530
Deal?

01:12:53.328 --> 01:12:55.664
We are getting the heck out of here.

01:13:16.602 --> 01:13:18.520
Let's go, Knights!

01:13:38.957 --> 01:13:40.375
...is the same as.

01:14:10.489 --> 01:14:13.283
Miss Bivens asked me
to be editor of the paper next year.

01:14:13.367 --> 01:14:15.744
What? That's amazing.

01:14:17.162 --> 01:14:18.497
I swear by the time you graduate,

01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:20.980
you're gonna have every school
in New York fighting over you.

01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:27.798
They're here.

01:14:32.719 --> 01:14:34.471
Don't worry about us.

01:14:35.097 --> 01:14:36.431
We'll be fine.

01:14:37.808 --> 01:14:39.059
Yeah.

01:14:39.142 --> 01:14:40.519
Hey uh...

01:14:42.062 --> 01:14:43.647
I left five bucks in there.

01:14:45.107 --> 01:14:46.733
Start saving up, you're next.

01:14:48.568 --> 01:14:50.028
Dad's in the backyard.

01:14:50.821 --> 01:14:52.239
I think it's clear.

01:14:52.948 --> 01:14:54.783
I love you guys.

01:14:55.409 --> 01:14:56.994
Love you.

01:14:59.079 --> 01:15:00.789
- All right, bye.
- Bye.

01:15:00.872 --> 01:15:02.592
- I love you.
- Love you.

01:15:09.715 --> 01:15:11.049
- Lori.
- Let's go.

01:15:11.133 --> 01:15:13.319
Hey, where the hell
do you think you're going?

01:15:13.343 --> 01:15:15.095
Guess it wasn't clear.

01:15:15.178 --> 01:15:16.458
- Hey!
- Hurry!

01:15:16.513 --> 01:15:18.533
- I'm talking to you, girl!
- Get in.

01:15:18.557 --> 01:15:20.934
Get your ass out of that car
right now!

01:15:21.018 --> 01:15:22.477
Brad, go!

01:15:42.622 --> 01:15:44.458
You know why she left?

01:15:47.919 --> 01:15:48.920
Huh?

01:15:53.633 --> 01:15:54.926
Brian?

01:15:55.010 --> 01:15:56.803
You know why she left?

01:16:00.307 --> 01:16:01.683
Maureen?

01:16:10.317 --> 01:16:12.069
You gonna leave too?

01:16:17.032 --> 01:16:18.325
Answer me.

01:16:20.035 --> 01:16:21.035
Answer me!

01:16:21.078 --> 01:16:23.830
- Rex.
- Shut up!

01:16:28.752 --> 01:16:29.753
No, sir.

01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:40.430
Who didn't take out the damn trash?

01:17:26.351 --> 01:17:28.061
Lori?

01:17:28.145 --> 01:17:29.771
- Coast clear?
- Yeah.

01:17:29.855 --> 01:17:31.982
He's passed out. How is everything?

01:17:32.065 --> 01:17:36.528
Well, last night at the restaurant
I met a writing professor from Barnard.

01:17:36.611 --> 01:17:39.823
I told her you had applied to her school
and she was really nice about it.

01:17:39.906 --> 01:17:42.242
She said she'd be happy
to read your stuff.

01:17:42.325 --> 01:17:44.828
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

01:17:44.911 --> 01:17:46.872
She said to call her when you get up here.

01:17:46.955 --> 01:17:48.623
That's amazing.

01:17:48.707 --> 01:17:50.333
How's the escape fund looking?

01:17:50.417 --> 01:17:52.252
Oh, it's getting close.

01:17:52.335 --> 01:17:55.088
I think I've babysat every demon child
in Welch by now.

01:17:55.172 --> 01:17:56.214
- You wanna hear?
- Uh-hmm.

01:17:59.968 --> 01:18:02.512
- Sounds like freedom.
- Sure sounds fat.

01:18:05.307 --> 01:18:07.267
Oh, you're really gonna
love it here, Jeannette.

01:18:07.934 --> 01:18:09.936
It feels like you're breathing
for the first time.

01:18:12.772 --> 01:18:14.774
I don't think he's gonna let me go.

01:18:15.525 --> 01:18:18.737
Hey, come on. Don't even think about that.

01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:21.656
- It doesn't matter...

01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:22.782
- What was that?
- Hold on.

01:18:22.866 --> 01:18:24.951
- Can you call me back? Call me back.
- Okay.

01:18:43.386 --> 01:18:45.013
I'm sorry.

01:18:48.808 --> 01:18:50.268
Erma died.

01:19:19.923 --> 01:19:21.383
Do you think...

01:19:22.467 --> 01:19:25.011
Erma ever did something to Dad?

01:19:26.012 --> 01:19:27.389
Like what?

01:19:31.142 --> 01:19:33.395
Like what she did to Brian.

01:19:36.898 --> 01:19:39.234
You can't think about things like that.

01:19:39.317 --> 01:19:41.027
It'll make you crazy.

01:19:47.033 --> 01:19:48.743
I'm gonna meet you back at home.

01:20:16.479 --> 01:20:17.605
Dad...

01:20:18.940 --> 01:20:21.192
I'm sorry about Erma.

01:20:22.944 --> 01:20:25.113
Time to go, you go.

01:20:27.741 --> 01:20:29.576
I'm not talking about that.

01:20:33.288 --> 01:20:36.041
"It's impossible to breathe
when you're drowning in shit."

01:20:46.217 --> 01:20:48.337
Ready to lose that 40 bucks?

01:20:54.601 --> 01:20:56.227
Pay me now or pay me later?

01:20:56.311 --> 01:20:58.146
...40 bucks.

01:20:58.229 --> 01:20:59.939
You still believe in your old man?

01:21:02.484 --> 01:21:04.903
You want to help me hustle this guy?

01:21:04.986 --> 01:21:06.196
Make some money?

01:21:07.030 --> 01:21:11.868
Yeah. Okay, so, as long as you stroke
his ego, he'll keep playing.

01:21:11.951 --> 01:21:14.788
I'll pull the plug.
The second we drain him...

01:21:16.414 --> 01:21:17.665
You know the drill.

01:21:20.710 --> 01:21:22.087
Robbie.

01:21:24.381 --> 01:21:26.299
Hey, Rex.
- How are you?

01:21:26.925 --> 01:21:29.386
Who's that?
- My daughter.

01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:43.608
Jeannette?

01:21:44.818 --> 01:21:46.361
Name's Robbie.

01:21:47.195 --> 01:21:49.239
I didn't know Rex had a daughter.

01:21:51.783 --> 01:21:53.159
He has three.

01:21:54.744 --> 01:21:56.371
Rex said you like to dance.

01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:08.633
Do you like living in this town?

01:22:11.177 --> 01:22:12.637
It's all right.

01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:14.472
It ain't all right and you know it.

01:22:15.849 --> 01:22:20.103
We're all mudbugs in the boiling pot.
Don't even know we're being cooked alive.

01:22:22.856 --> 01:22:27.318
I'm heading off to Chicago
as soon as I can afford up savings for it.

01:22:28.987 --> 01:22:30.321
What 'bout you?

01:22:33.658 --> 01:22:37.787
I'm saving up to move up to New York City
to be with my sister.

01:22:38.872 --> 01:22:40.248
All right.

01:22:41.374 --> 01:22:42.750
The Big Apple.

01:22:43.376 --> 01:22:44.502
I like that city.

01:22:44.586 --> 01:22:46.546
I've been there a couple times.

01:22:47.255 --> 01:22:48.882
You're gonna love it.

01:22:52.343 --> 01:22:53.636
Yep.

01:22:55.847 --> 01:22:59.976
Hey, Robbie. Do something worthwhile
with those damn hands of yours.

01:23:00.059 --> 01:23:01.519
Get over here, play a game.

01:23:04.814 --> 01:23:06.107
Well, all right.

01:23:09.777 --> 01:23:11.738
Side pocket.

01:23:11.821 --> 01:23:13.281
Sure about that, Rex?

01:23:15.992 --> 01:23:18.286
- Ooh.
- Damn!

01:23:19.996 --> 01:23:22.165
Four games in a damn row.

01:23:22.624 --> 01:23:25.376
That'll be 80 bucks
unless you want to go double or noth'.

01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:28.755
Nope, take it all.

01:23:28.838 --> 01:23:32.342
- You deserve it.
- Here you go. Wash down that humble pie.

01:23:35.637 --> 01:23:36.971
To your daughter.

01:23:37.597 --> 01:23:40.016
And her big move to New York City.

01:23:44.312 --> 01:23:46.314
To New York City, huh?

01:23:54.697 --> 01:23:56.491
Can't believe I let that old fart take me.

01:23:56.574 --> 01:23:58.868
I don't know if I'm ticked or impressed.

01:24:05.667 --> 01:24:07.961
Hey, you know my apartment
is right upstairs.

01:24:08.044 --> 01:24:10.296
Got a bunch of records
laying on that jukebox,

01:24:10.380 --> 01:24:12.298
if you want to come up and listen a bit.

01:24:12.924 --> 01:24:14.634
Thanks, but I can't.

01:24:16.803 --> 01:24:19.097
Rex, you mind if I bring
your daughter upstairs for a bit,

01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:20.765
listen to some records?

01:24:25.937 --> 01:24:29.232
She's a big city girl now,
she can handle herself.

01:24:31.943 --> 01:24:33.695
Holler if you need me.

01:24:54.674 --> 01:24:56.860
- You know, I can't stay long.
- That's all right.

01:24:56.884 --> 01:24:59.887
I just want a light tune or two.

01:25:02.265 --> 01:25:04.100
I think you're gonna like this one.

01:25:11.357 --> 01:25:12.358
Where were we?

01:25:16.863 --> 01:25:19.407
I think we were dancing.
Sort of like this.

01:25:24.704 --> 01:25:27.790
Trying to sniff my hair?
What are you doing?

01:25:29.917 --> 01:25:32.378
- Oh.
- That's what I was trying to do.

01:25:32.837 --> 01:25:34.631
Oh, I'm not that kind of girl.

01:25:37.467 --> 01:25:40.595
Oh, we'll just dance then, all right?

01:25:46.392 --> 01:25:48.770
Oh. How'd that happen?

01:25:51.105 --> 01:25:53.983
Okay. Robbie, what are you doing?

01:25:54.734 --> 01:25:56.277
- Stop.
- Whoa.

01:25:56.361 --> 01:25:58.655
I just want to see what you
got underneath this dress.

01:25:59.238 --> 01:26:00.615
Robbie, stop.

01:26:01.407 --> 01:26:03.117
Easy. Take it easy.

01:26:03.201 --> 01:26:05.119
- Robbie.
- It's all right.

01:26:05.620 --> 01:26:06.996
Hey. Hey.

01:26:08.498 --> 01:26:09.666
Let me show you.

01:26:22.428 --> 01:26:23.888
Okay.

01:26:25.014 --> 01:26:26.265
There you go.

01:26:32.563 --> 01:26:35.024
Whoa.
- Uh-hmm.

01:26:36.818 --> 01:26:39.320
When I was a little girl,
I lit myself on fire.

01:26:42.156 --> 01:26:44.033
It gets worse down there.

01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:50.748
I'm gonna go now.

01:27:11.769 --> 01:27:14.063
I knew you could handle yourself.

01:27:17.483 --> 01:27:21.154
Just like that time I taught you to swim.

01:27:21.237 --> 01:27:25.199
You thought you was gonna drown,
but I knew you'd do just fine.

01:27:33.207 --> 01:27:34.959
We'll cut it here.

01:27:37.587 --> 01:27:39.046
Here's your cut.

01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:43.634
Take it or not?

01:27:44.302 --> 01:27:46.429
Might come in handy for the big move.

01:27:52.727 --> 01:27:54.687
I don't care what Erma did to you.

01:27:56.689 --> 01:27:58.524
There's no excuse.

01:28:01.861 --> 01:28:04.781
I am moving to New York.
There's nothing that you can do about it.

01:28:13.664 --> 01:28:16.459
- You okay?
- I need to get the hell out of here.

01:28:41.442 --> 01:28:45.112
Well, somebody sure gutted
your piggy didn't they?

01:28:46.030 --> 01:28:47.532
Any suspects?

01:28:50.409 --> 01:28:51.619
That money was mine.

01:29:12.723 --> 01:29:14.600
Why are you doing this to us, Dad?

01:29:32.702 --> 01:29:34.871
New York Magazine,
this is Jeannette Walls.

01:29:35.371 --> 01:29:36.622
Hey, big shot.

01:29:37.623 --> 01:29:38.666
Maureen?

01:29:39.333 --> 01:29:40.626
How's your fancy life?

01:29:40.710 --> 01:29:44.380
Just getting ready
for my fancy engagement party.

01:29:44.463 --> 01:29:45.798
We're excited to see you.

01:29:46.757 --> 01:29:48.551
I can't make it tonight.

01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:50.428
Why not?

01:29:51.929 --> 01:29:53.639
'Cause I'm moving to California.

01:29:54.223 --> 01:29:55.725
You're not serious.

01:29:57.852 --> 01:29:59.729
Maureen, you can't go to California.

01:30:01.147 --> 01:30:02.899
That's the other side of the country.

01:30:03.983 --> 01:30:05.985
We have to stick together. We always have.

01:30:08.571 --> 01:30:09.947
That's not true.

01:30:12.033 --> 01:30:13.367
I gotta go.

01:30:13.993 --> 01:30:14.993
I love you.

01:30:18.164 --> 01:30:19.832
Why would she go to California?

01:30:20.833 --> 01:30:23.836
It's as far away from them
as she can get without swimming to Hawaii.

01:30:26.797 --> 01:30:28.132
It's our fault.

01:30:29.091 --> 01:30:31.135
We should have never
left her alone with them.

01:30:35.556 --> 01:30:37.308
She would have hated us anyway.

01:30:39.518 --> 01:30:40.603
David sure doesn't.

01:30:40.686 --> 01:30:42.104
Thank you so much for coming.

01:30:42.188 --> 01:30:44.774
- Who needs more bubbly?
- We do.

01:30:46.984 --> 01:30:48.861
Hi, handsome.

01:30:48.945 --> 01:30:50.237
Did you invite them?

01:30:51.656 --> 01:30:52.657
Oops.

01:30:54.033 --> 01:30:56.327
- Look who's here. Oh!
- Okay.

01:30:56.410 --> 01:30:59.413
- Okay.
- Thank you. Thank you.

01:30:59.997 --> 01:31:01.332
This will be interesting.

01:31:01.415 --> 01:31:02.935
Let's get this party started.

01:31:02.959 --> 01:31:06.295
Congratulations, honey.

01:31:08.673 --> 01:31:12.885
What does an investment banker
use as birth control?

01:31:13.594 --> 01:31:17.139
- His personality.

01:31:17.223 --> 01:31:18.516
Alright, one more.

01:31:18.599 --> 01:31:20.935
What's the difference between
a bag of manure on your lawn

01:31:21.018 --> 01:31:23.413
- and an investment banker?
- Can I speak with you for a second?

01:31:23.437 --> 01:31:25.314
Right in the middle of a punchline.

01:31:25.398 --> 01:31:27.149
Okay, hold that thought, gents.

01:31:27.233 --> 01:31:28.734
All right.

01:31:28.818 --> 01:31:30.027
Who is that guy?

01:31:35.408 --> 01:31:36.575
Swanky.

01:31:36.659 --> 01:31:38.869
I don't see one of your mama's paintings.

01:31:39.954 --> 01:31:41.622
What are you doing here?

01:31:41.706 --> 01:31:46.085
Well, just networkin'
with all these fantastic people.

01:31:46.794 --> 01:31:49.672
Every time someone leaves
you act like a child.

01:31:50.214 --> 01:31:52.008
You think you'd be used to it by now.

01:31:52.967 --> 01:31:54.552
What's that supposed to mean?

01:31:54.635 --> 01:31:56.470
It's not a surprise, Dad.

01:31:57.471 --> 01:32:00.099
Maureen left because your bullshit
drove her crazy.

01:32:01.142 --> 01:32:04.145
You really want to talk
about bullshit right now?

01:32:05.104 --> 01:32:07.898
Look around. This ain't you.

01:32:07.982 --> 01:32:10.026
You ain't like those pawns
and you know it.

01:32:10.109 --> 01:32:11.444
Don't turn this on me.

01:32:11.527 --> 01:32:12.945
You're a Walls.

01:32:13.029 --> 01:32:16.532
You were born to change the world,
not just add to the noise.

01:32:16.615 --> 01:32:18.868
You cannot marry that fool.

01:32:18.951 --> 01:32:22.747
You're better than him and you're better
than that goddamn gossip column.

01:32:22.830 --> 01:32:24.373
You're a real writer.

01:32:25.499 --> 01:32:27.209
I like my life, Dad.

01:32:28.335 --> 01:32:31.505
Well then why is all your crap
packed up in those boxes?

01:32:33.924 --> 01:32:35.551
What's going on guys?

01:32:36.802 --> 01:32:38.637
We don't want to upset David.

01:32:38.721 --> 01:32:41.140
Why do you care so much about David
all of the sudden?

01:32:41.724 --> 01:32:45.311
Well, he's like, part of the family now.
Right, honey?

01:32:45.394 --> 01:32:47.563
Hey, hey, hey. This is not the time.

01:32:47.646 --> 01:32:50.066
- Well when's the right time?
- Not right now, okay?

01:32:50.149 --> 01:32:51.543
Well, there were three more offers today.

01:32:51.567 --> 01:32:53.319
So you can wait till tomorrow.

01:32:53.402 --> 01:32:54.945
- I had to tell her.
- Tell me what?

01:32:55.029 --> 01:32:56.715
- Trust me now is not the time.
- Tell me what, Mom?

01:32:56.739 --> 01:32:58.115
Let me talk!

01:33:01.077 --> 01:33:03.120
You know how I was telling you
about my brother

01:33:03.204 --> 01:33:05.581
selling his half of Mom's land in Texas?

01:33:06.123 --> 01:33:10.753
Well, now that you're getting married
and you have all these nice things...

01:33:11.670 --> 01:33:18.052
we were thinking that maybe we could...
borrow the money to buy it.

01:33:18.803 --> 01:33:22.515
So the only reason why you're being nice
to David is because you want his money?

01:33:23.015 --> 01:33:26.477
No, it's not the only reason.
I'm also just a nice person.

01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:28.854
- You are a nice person.
- Thank you.

01:33:29.438 --> 01:33:31.857
We wouldn't ask
if it wasn't urgent, honey.

01:33:32.525 --> 01:33:33.526
How much?

01:33:33.609 --> 01:33:35.653
- Let's not get into...
- About a million.

01:33:38.072 --> 01:33:39.365
A million dollars.

01:33:39.907 --> 01:33:41.033
A little under.

01:33:42.618 --> 01:33:43.619
A little under.

01:33:44.829 --> 01:33:48.499
Well if Uncle Jim's land is worth
that much than yours is too.

01:33:48.582 --> 01:33:51.210
Well, I don't know,
I've never had it appraised.

01:33:51.293 --> 01:33:55.464
I-I... My father taught me,
you never sell land.

01:33:55.548 --> 01:33:57.842
- Good advice.
- Right.

01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:02.263
Grandma Smith died when I was 11.

01:34:04.098 --> 01:34:07.309
Have you been sitting on
a million dollars since I was 11?

01:34:07.393 --> 01:34:11.814
No, no. It appreciates over time.
It escalates.

01:34:11.897 --> 01:34:13.816
You knew about this?

01:34:15.985 --> 01:34:18.279
You realize what we could have done
with that money?

01:34:18.362 --> 01:34:21.157
I don't want my kids raised
on a goddamn handout.

01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:22.658
What the hell?

01:34:22.741 --> 01:34:24.243
What the hell is wrong with you?

01:34:26.287 --> 01:34:27.663
Nice, Rose.

01:34:30.332 --> 01:34:31.750
Hey, Mountain Goat.

01:34:31.834 --> 01:34:33.586
Don't ever call me that again.

01:34:34.086 --> 01:34:36.005
- Uh, Jeannette.
- David, please.

01:34:36.088 --> 01:34:37.840
Come on. I know you're upset,

01:34:37.923 --> 01:34:39.860
but let's just go back
and talk about this. Come on.

01:34:39.884 --> 01:34:43.095
Dad. Why do you think all of us
ran away from you?

01:34:43.846 --> 01:34:45.097
We were drowning.

01:34:46.015 --> 01:34:49.101
I still don't understand
why you followed us here.

01:34:49.185 --> 01:34:51.437
We wanted to be a family again.

01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:54.231
We were never a family, Mom.
We were a nightmare.

01:34:54.315 --> 01:34:56.942
Your mom and I did everything
we could for you, okay?

01:34:57.026 --> 01:34:58.360
We looked after you...

01:34:58.444 --> 01:35:00.613
- and it was a happy family.
- Bullshit! Bullshit!

01:35:00.696 --> 01:35:01.864
We did it!

01:35:01.947 --> 01:35:05.159
We took care of each other
because you were too drunk to.

01:35:07.244 --> 01:35:11.540
It was your job to protect us
and you didn't even try.

01:35:11.624 --> 01:35:13.709
That ain't true, okay?

01:35:13.792 --> 01:35:15.395
- You got some kind of weird revisionist...
- It is true.

01:35:15.419 --> 01:35:16.545
history going on.

01:35:16.629 --> 01:35:18.088
- You were a happy kid.
- Dad...

01:35:18.172 --> 01:35:19.774
- stop talking.
- And they were happy kids.

01:35:19.798 --> 01:35:21.234
- Stop talking!
- And we looked after you!

01:35:21.258 --> 01:35:22.968
- And...
- Stop talking!

01:35:23.052 --> 01:35:24.762
Talking is not trying!

01:35:26.263 --> 01:35:28.641
You talked my whole goddamn life!

01:35:31.060 --> 01:35:32.853
I believed you.

01:35:34.563 --> 01:35:36.023
- Come on.
- Don't.

01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:37.680
Hey, don't do this.

01:35:38.817 --> 01:35:40.236
I don't want you in my life.

01:35:40.986 --> 01:35:43.256
- Jeannette, you do not mean that.
- I don't want you to call,

01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:45.115
or write,
or show up out of the blue.

01:35:45.199 --> 01:35:47.493
I don't want another one
of your bullshit stories.

01:35:47.576 --> 01:35:49.286
I don't want to see you anymore.

01:36:09.807 --> 01:36:11.016
I gotta go.

01:36:12.476 --> 01:36:14.353
See you soon, little sister.

01:36:42.047 --> 01:36:46.427
I think I figured out how to deal
with the lack of sunlight on the hillside.

01:36:47.219 --> 01:36:51.890
I just need to install specially
curved mirrors to all solar cells.

01:36:53.100 --> 01:36:54.953
- See what I was thinking was you don't...
- Dad.

01:36:54.977 --> 01:36:55.978
go right away.

01:36:56.061 --> 01:36:57.938
- You could just uh...
- Dad.

01:36:58.022 --> 01:36:59.523
you could finish school here

01:36:59.606 --> 01:37:01.525
- and get a job at the Welch Daily News
- Dad.

01:37:01.608 --> 01:37:04.028
- and I will help you write those articles.
- I am going.

01:37:04.111 --> 01:37:06.322
Remember how we used to do that?

01:37:06.822 --> 01:37:07.948
You remember that?

01:37:09.199 --> 01:37:11.493
You are never going to build
the glass castle.

01:37:11.577 --> 01:37:13.162
- Oh, I am.
- You're not.

01:37:13.245 --> 01:37:14.538
I am.

01:37:14.621 --> 01:37:17.499
- Um, I got it right there.
- And even if you do, it doesn't matter.

01:37:19.043 --> 01:37:20.919
I'm getting on the first bus out of here.

01:37:21.587 --> 01:37:24.381
- Well.
- If the bus breaks down, I'm gonna walk.

01:37:24.465 --> 01:37:26.425
I am gonna finish this thing.

01:37:26.508 --> 01:37:29.386
- I can guaran-goddamn-tee it.
- I will hitchhike if I have to, Dad.

01:37:30.429 --> 01:37:33.474
Build it if you want,
but don't build it for me.

01:37:33.557 --> 01:37:35.893
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Jeannette.

01:37:38.729 --> 01:37:40.731
- Mountain Goat!

01:38:06.632 --> 01:38:08.467
Okay, so I'm gonna pick you up after work

01:38:08.550 --> 01:38:10.636
and we'll head straight
to the restaurant from there.

01:38:11.345 --> 01:38:12.721
Where?

01:38:12.805 --> 01:38:14.932
We have dinner
with Mr. Lehocky and his wife.

01:38:18.018 --> 01:38:19.853
Jeannette, remember I told you about this?

01:38:20.687 --> 01:38:23.625
Furniture designer? This guy's got more
money than he knows what to do with it.

01:38:23.649 --> 01:38:25.289
He made the chair that you're sitting in.

01:38:26.693 --> 01:38:29.738
Oh, right. The furniture designer.
I... Yeah, I got it.

01:38:31.448 --> 01:38:32.449
Jeannette, please.

01:38:33.617 --> 01:38:35.411
This is a very big account, okay?

01:38:35.494 --> 01:38:36.745
It's huge for us.

01:38:37.871 --> 01:38:39.123
I said I got it.

01:38:39.206 --> 01:38:41.750
Okay. Can you get that? I got to go.

01:38:41.834 --> 01:38:42.918
Uh-huh.

01:38:48.090 --> 01:38:50.068
Jeannette?

01:38:50.092 --> 01:38:51.969
It's me, sweetie.

01:38:52.886 --> 01:38:55.055
It's been too long.

01:38:55.139 --> 01:38:57.558
You can't ignore us forever, honey.

01:38:58.892 --> 01:39:01.437
Just really need to talk to you
about something.

01:39:02.563 --> 01:39:04.606
- Okay?

01:39:06.358 --> 01:39:09.611
Have you been to the Picasso Retrospective
up at MoMA yet?

01:39:09.695 --> 01:39:11.864
- Mom.
- Oh, don't, don't waste your time.

01:39:11.947 --> 01:39:15.200
He really didn't do anything worthwhile
after his Rose Period.

01:39:15.284 --> 01:39:17.369
All that cubist stuff is so gimmicky.

01:39:17.453 --> 01:39:19.830
Mom, I have to go back to work.
Why are you here?

01:39:20.622 --> 01:39:23.876
I-I-I need to sit down.

01:39:27.713 --> 01:39:31.341
You know how I am
with sentimental situations like this.

01:39:32.634 --> 01:39:33.844
I just...

01:39:34.803 --> 01:39:36.680
I don't know what to do.

01:39:38.807 --> 01:39:40.225
What's going on?

01:39:43.562 --> 01:39:45.147
Your dad's sick.

01:39:45.230 --> 01:39:47.399
And he's not getting better.

01:39:48.317 --> 01:39:50.277
He stopped talking last week.

01:39:52.654 --> 01:39:54.031
Well, what does that mean?

01:39:54.114 --> 01:39:56.783
Oh, he was ranting about
that night at David's.

01:39:56.867 --> 01:39:59.953
All that stuff he said
about his drinking and...

01:40:00.954 --> 01:40:03.874
how talking isn't trying
and whatever else he said

01:40:03.957 --> 01:40:06.877
And then he asked me
if I think he talks too much

01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:08.754
and I said yeah 'cause he does.

01:40:10.756 --> 01:40:12.424
And then he just stopped.

01:40:15.511 --> 01:40:17.554
Hasn't said a word since.

01:40:20.516 --> 01:40:23.352
Won't get out of bed. Barely eats.

01:40:24.269 --> 01:40:25.771
Sounds as awful.

01:40:32.611 --> 01:40:34.071
He's dying, Jeannette.

01:40:38.283 --> 01:40:39.993
You have a right to be angry.

01:40:40.077 --> 01:40:41.620
And you think I don't know that?

01:40:41.703 --> 01:40:43.038
Of course you do.

01:40:45.582 --> 01:40:48.210
Look, I don't want to tell you
what to do, ever.

01:40:50.337 --> 01:40:52.839
But I know you love him and I just think

01:40:52.923 --> 01:40:55.801
you'll regret it if you don't come home
and say good-bye.

01:41:02.182 --> 01:41:04.351
Mom, I said good-bye a long time ago.

01:41:04.434 --> 01:41:05.644
Jeannette.

01:41:09.398 --> 01:41:12.568
The doctor told him a month if
he stops drinking which he won't.

01:41:12.651 --> 01:41:14.611
So who knows.

01:41:15.904 --> 01:41:17.656
What exactly is it?

01:41:18.407 --> 01:41:20.993
Pretty much everything you can get from
four packs of cigarettes

01:41:21.076 --> 01:41:23.412
and two quarts of booze
every day for 50 years.

01:41:24.288 --> 01:41:25.706
He doesn't look good.

01:41:26.748 --> 01:41:28.125
You have to go see him.

01:41:31.336 --> 01:41:32.546
No, I don't.

01:41:33.630 --> 01:41:35.215
You're right, you don't...

01:41:37.134 --> 01:41:38.969
but you kinda do.

01:41:39.970 --> 01:41:41.530
He's done a lot of shitty things but...

01:41:43.724 --> 01:41:45.058
he's had his moments.

01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:01.366
Daddy in the hall!

01:42:01.450 --> 01:42:03.744
Does anybody know where
Jeannette's room is?

01:42:05.495 --> 01:42:06.913
Oh, thank you kindly, ma'am.

01:42:13.253 --> 01:42:14.796
What are you snoseling about?

01:42:15.380 --> 01:42:17.090
What are you doing here?

01:42:17.174 --> 01:42:22.429
Uh, I thought I'd finally come check out
this high falutin' college of yours.

01:42:22.512 --> 01:42:26.058
I gotta say for the tuition,
I expected a bit more.

01:42:30.062 --> 01:42:33.398
Your mom says that you're jumping ship.

01:42:34.316 --> 01:42:36.443
What happened to all
your fancy scholarships?

01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:39.613
It isn't enough.

01:42:39.696 --> 01:42:43.533
And they don't cut a break for poor little
country girls with big dreams?

01:42:44.117 --> 01:42:45.619
I didn't say I didn't warn you.

01:42:45.702 --> 01:42:48.789
Did you come all the way here from Welch
just to rub it in my face?

01:42:49.665 --> 01:42:51.375
You were right, okay?

01:42:51.458 --> 01:42:53.960
I never should have come here
and now I'm dropping out.

01:42:54.044 --> 01:42:55.545
The hell you are.

01:43:00.425 --> 01:43:04.805
That's $950 and uh,

01:43:04.888 --> 01:43:09.685
that there is genuine 100% mink.

01:43:09.768 --> 01:43:12.229
You should be able to pawn that
for at least 50.

01:43:14.648 --> 01:43:16.358
Where did you get all this?

01:43:16.983 --> 01:43:21.279
New York City's full of poker players who
wouldn't know their ass from their elbows

01:43:21.363 --> 01:43:24.449
and your ma said I finally had
a good reason to gamble.

01:43:26.910 --> 01:43:28.745
You did this for me?

01:43:29.329 --> 01:43:32.874
Since when is it wrong for a father
to take care of his little girl?

01:43:43.343 --> 01:43:45.846
So it turns out Mrs. Lehocky
is actually a fan of yours.

01:43:45.929 --> 01:43:47.931
She reads your column every week.

01:43:48.014 --> 01:43:50.976
Rich, white and old
is our target audience.

01:43:56.022 --> 01:43:57.983
I heard your Mom's message on the machine.

01:43:59.067 --> 01:44:00.610
Is something going on?

01:44:02.529 --> 01:44:04.406
Ah, it's just Mom-being-Mom.

01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:08.869
You know, whatever they want...

01:44:10.370 --> 01:44:11.913
please don't give in.

01:44:13.331 --> 01:44:15.208
You've been so much better without them.

01:44:19.796 --> 01:44:21.339
Have I?

01:44:25.552 --> 01:44:28.805
We've been a team so long
it's hard to tell who does what anymore.

01:44:29.431 --> 01:44:31.683
But Ollie's always been
a master craftsman

01:44:31.767 --> 01:44:33.769
and I'm more of a visual person.

01:44:33.852 --> 01:44:35.854
Vi's the real artist of the operation.

01:44:35.937 --> 01:44:37.481
I just make sure they don't fall apart

01:44:37.564 --> 01:44:39.483
- when you sit down.

01:44:39.566 --> 01:44:43.028
But when we were your age, we didn't
think any of this was going to happen.

01:44:43.111 --> 01:44:47.532
We would've been fine making chairs out of
a tiny garage for the rest of our lives.

01:44:47.616 --> 01:44:49.284
Ah, just do what makes you happy.

01:44:49.367 --> 01:44:51.203
You may make some money and you might not.

01:44:51.745 --> 01:44:53.985
It don't matter either way
if you're doing what you love.

01:44:54.998 --> 01:44:58.418
And what about you Jeannette?
Is this what you've always wanted to do?

01:45:01.046 --> 01:45:03.757
Um, no, actually.

01:45:04.758 --> 01:45:06.760
I was once a political science major.

01:45:07.302 --> 01:45:11.890
I was very eager to write stories
that would actually matter.

01:45:11.973 --> 01:45:13.767
Your stories matter to me.

01:45:13.850 --> 01:45:15.060
Thank you.

01:45:16.186 --> 01:45:18.146
I don't know. It's just um,

01:45:18.230 --> 01:45:20.524
this is not where
I thought that I was gonna end up.

01:45:21.149 --> 01:45:22.984
Well, maybe you're not at the end yet.

01:45:27.739 --> 01:45:30.867
Jeannette's dad is developing
a technology to burn

01:45:30.951 --> 01:45:33.411
low-grade bituminous coal
more efficiently.

01:45:34.037 --> 01:45:36.957
- Well, isn't that nice?
- Hmm.

01:45:37.541 --> 01:45:39.209
Where's your dad now?

01:45:39.292 --> 01:45:40.293
Oh.

01:45:46.007 --> 01:45:48.260
I'm sorry.
Would you excuse me for a sec?

01:46:06.111 --> 01:46:07.279
There.

01:46:08.029 --> 01:46:09.364
How does that feel?

01:46:12.534 --> 01:46:16.496
It's so ugly, Daddy.
I look like the demon.

01:46:16.580 --> 01:46:21.001
Hey. There's nothing ugly about you.
You hear me?

01:46:22.711 --> 01:46:24.713
One day I promise you,
you're gonna look at this

01:46:24.796 --> 01:46:28.216
as just another side of
how strong you are.

01:46:30.802 --> 01:46:32.762
You're a Walls, Mountain Goat.

01:46:33.638 --> 01:46:35.640
And we ain't like other people.

01:46:35.724 --> 01:46:39.019
We got a fire burning in our bellies.

01:46:39.561 --> 01:46:41.771
And that there is goddamn proof of it.

01:46:45.525 --> 01:46:46.525
Now...

01:46:47.652 --> 01:46:52.073
this knife is especially designed
to hunt demons.

01:46:53.408 --> 01:46:54.618
It's very sharp.

01:46:55.243 --> 01:46:57.495
Don't take it out unless you see him.

01:47:01.416 --> 01:47:03.043
You can borrow it for the night.

01:47:06.296 --> 01:47:09.174
You know, all monsters are the same.

01:47:10.550 --> 01:47:13.887
They like to frighten people,
but the minute you stare 'em down,

01:47:13.970 --> 01:47:16.139
they turn tail and run.

01:47:23.229 --> 01:47:25.148
I love you, Mountain Goat.

01:47:53.885 --> 01:47:56.447
I think that it expands the
business and then there's a...

01:47:56.471 --> 01:48:01.017
My parents are squatting in an
abandoned building on the Lower East Side.

01:48:01.101 --> 01:48:02.701
Jeannette.
- They were homeless

01:48:02.769 --> 01:48:05.563
for three years before that which
is pretty much how they raised us.

01:48:06.773 --> 01:48:09.901
My dad is not developing
a technology for bituminous coal,

01:48:09.985 --> 01:48:12.487
but he could tell you anything
that you want to know about it.

01:48:13.488 --> 01:48:15.573
He is the smartest man that I know.

01:48:17.450 --> 01:48:19.244
He is also a drunk.

01:48:19.327 --> 01:48:23.540
Never finishes what he starts
and can be extremely cruel.

01:48:24.666 --> 01:48:26.960
But he dreams bigger
than anyone I've ever met.

01:48:27.043 --> 01:48:29.254
And he never tries to be somebody
that he's not.

01:48:31.256 --> 01:48:33.299
He never wanted me to either.

01:48:42.392 --> 01:48:44.519
I'm sorry, but I have to leave.

01:48:51.860 --> 01:48:52.944
Go.

01:49:06.708 --> 01:49:08.752
You ready to go get that demon?

01:49:16.634 --> 01:49:18.094
Let's go!

01:50:09.062 --> 01:50:10.772
I'll go get some air.

01:50:11.439 --> 01:50:12.732
I'll leave you to it.

01:50:23.118 --> 01:50:24.160
Hey, Dad.

01:50:44.889 --> 01:50:48.226
Do you remember when those grape pickers
in California went on strike?

01:50:49.144 --> 01:50:51.980
And the vineyards had to sell everything
for a nickel a pound?

01:50:54.065 --> 01:50:57.110
You stuffed the car so full,
we couldn't see out the windows.

01:50:59.737 --> 01:51:03.199
Brian found some in his pocket two weeks
later that had turned into raisins.

01:51:06.953 --> 01:51:10.915
Or when you let me pet that
cheetah at the zoo.

01:51:16.838 --> 01:51:20.967
She was licking that
popcorn butter off your hand.

01:51:22.677 --> 01:51:25.555
Those other parents wanted
to chop my head off.

01:51:28.224 --> 01:51:29.559
They were just jealous.

01:51:34.647 --> 01:51:38.067
Remember when
you made your own braces?

01:51:39.194 --> 01:51:42.280
You were a goddamn freakin'
engineering genius.

01:51:43.239 --> 01:51:45.200
It was a hanger and a rubber band.

01:51:45.950 --> 01:51:47.660
By God, worked.

01:51:50.121 --> 01:51:52.498
Look at those gorgeous chompers.

01:52:02.425 --> 01:52:04.928
Oh, Mom says
you haven't been talking lately.

01:52:20.735 --> 01:52:23.655
It's 'cause I'm taking some time to think.

01:52:29.035 --> 01:52:30.370
Here.

01:52:36.584 --> 01:52:37.669
What's this?

01:52:39.003 --> 01:52:41.714
It's every story
you've written since eighth grade.

01:52:44.342 --> 01:52:46.803
I thought maybe
you could start adding to it for me.

01:53:12.537 --> 01:53:14.247
I've spent my whole...

01:53:15.331 --> 01:53:16.582
life...

01:53:17.375 --> 01:53:21.296
hunting for those demons
in the wild and...

01:53:22.714 --> 01:53:26.843
the entire time
they were hiding inside my own body.

01:53:35.268 --> 01:53:37.687
Sad state to spend your life in.

01:53:39.063 --> 01:53:41.149
Being afraid of your own self.

01:53:47.071 --> 01:53:48.448
I know it...

01:53:50.491 --> 01:53:52.452
wasn't easy on you kids.

01:54:01.586 --> 01:54:04.756
I've got a lot to regret about my life.

01:54:05.923 --> 01:54:07.008
Dad.

01:54:14.098 --> 01:54:15.308
Never forget...

01:54:16.684 --> 01:54:19.479
how beautiful you are, Mountain Goat.

01:54:21.356 --> 01:54:27.528
And smart and creative and strong.

01:54:29.489 --> 01:54:31.366
You're so strong.

01:54:37.580 --> 01:54:41.209
No little girl should ever
have to carry her daddy on her back.

01:54:49.467 --> 01:54:51.677
You ain't like me at all, Mountain Goat.

01:54:53.930 --> 01:54:55.348
You're not afraid to...

01:55:01.187 --> 01:55:02.897
I am like you.

01:55:06.651 --> 01:55:07.860
And I'm glad.

01:55:14.951 --> 01:55:16.911
We had some good times, didn't we?

01:55:25.545 --> 01:55:28.047
We never did build that glass castle.

01:55:31.634 --> 01:55:32.885
No.

01:55:35.805 --> 01:55:37.765
But we had a good time planning it.

01:56:16.471 --> 01:56:18.764
Hi. Happy Thanksgiving.

01:56:18.848 --> 01:56:20.576
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Something smells good.

01:56:20.600 --> 01:56:22.268
How's life as a freelancer?

01:56:22.351 --> 01:56:25.271
- I'm still getting used to it.
- Yeah, you like being poor again?

01:56:25.354 --> 01:56:27.374
- Thanks, Brian.
- Careful with my child.

01:56:27.398 --> 01:56:28.858
Hey.
- Maureen.

01:56:28.941 --> 01:56:31.461
- I like your new place.
- How's California?

01:56:31.486 --> 01:56:32.904
It's really nice. It's sunny.

01:56:32.987 --> 01:56:34.906
Here's your housewarming present.

01:56:35.573 --> 01:56:37.909
I thought you'd like one of him.

01:56:37.992 --> 01:56:40.453
I didn't do so well with the hair, but

01:56:41.370 --> 01:56:42.580
do you like it, honey?

01:56:43.706 --> 01:56:45.082
It's perfect.

01:56:46.751 --> 01:56:49.212
Wait. What? What?

01:56:49.879 --> 01:56:52.590
- I never told you about this?
- No you didn't.

01:56:52.673 --> 01:56:54.592
He didn't have money for presents,

01:56:54.675 --> 01:56:56.511
so he takes each of us outside,

01:56:56.594 --> 01:56:59.180
and says that we could
just pick out our own star.

01:56:59.263 --> 01:57:01.098
- Seriously?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:57:01.182 --> 01:57:03.684
Anyone we want, so you know,
I took uh, Rigel.

01:57:03.768 --> 01:57:06.187
It's that little blue, little blue one
on the foot of Orion.

01:57:06.687 --> 01:57:08.773
Yeah. What was yours, Lori?

01:57:08.856 --> 01:57:12.360
Well, I chose Beetlejuice 'cause it was
this pretty shade of red.

01:57:12.443 --> 01:57:15.563
Then later that night Dad told me, it was
only that color because it was dying.

01:57:15.613 --> 01:57:18.074
That's right. You got the dud!

01:57:18.157 --> 01:57:19.659
You were so mad.

01:57:19.742 --> 01:57:21.661
Yeah 'cause he wouldn't let me
pick a new one.

01:57:21.744 --> 01:57:23.746
There's no return policies in outer space.

01:57:23.829 --> 01:57:26.916
Right? Well that only works for plastic
toys made in Japan.

01:57:29.877 --> 01:57:31.754
But he also said...

01:57:32.713 --> 01:57:35.883
"When everyone else's junk
is broken and forgotten,

01:57:35.967 --> 01:57:37.802
you'll still have your stars."

01:57:40.680 --> 01:57:41.847
Yeah.

01:57:47.353 --> 01:57:49.673
- Jeannette, what's going on?
- You okay?

01:57:50.606 --> 01:57:52.775
What are
you thinking, sweetie?

01:57:56.862 --> 01:57:58.823
I ju... I just...

01:58:01.409 --> 01:58:04.453
I feel really lucky.

01:58:08.249 --> 01:58:10.376
That's so sweet.

01:58:11.669 --> 01:58:13.921
Let's make a toast to Rex.

01:58:14.672 --> 01:58:15.965
Yeah.

01:58:16.048 --> 01:58:20.052
A life with your father was never boring.

01:59:32.625 --> 01:59:35.086
All these here are portraits of people.

01:59:35.169 --> 01:59:37.713
I have a whole box of flowers back there.

01:59:37.797 --> 01:59:41.425
Down here, people like my flowers
better than they did in New York.

01:59:42.885 --> 01:59:46.013
You know Jeannette's story about how
he gave her a star?

01:59:46.097 --> 01:59:48.891
What a difference between Lori's
and Jeannette's.

01:59:48.974 --> 01:59:52.853
"Jeannette, I got a star.
Oh, Daddy, you're so wonderful."

01:59:53.688 --> 01:59:55.106
"I love you."

01:59:56.148 --> 02:00:00.152
And Lori says, "You goddamn son of
a bitch, you did have enough money."

02:00:01.028 --> 02:00:04.699
They burn that hillside black

02:00:04.782 --> 02:00:08.160
They lay the maple down on its back

02:00:08.244 --> 02:00:11.914
For just one stardust stone

02:00:11.997 --> 02:00:15.334
Sleepin' innocent below

02:00:15.418 --> 02:00:19.255
But they'll run when
the warm rain comes

02:00:20.214 --> 02:00:21.841
The stock story...

02:00:23.426 --> 02:00:27.680
Dad loved grand gestures

02:00:27.763 --> 02:00:32.268
that preferably did not require
a whole lot of follow up.

02:00:34.854 --> 02:00:36.480
And he did it twice.

02:00:38.733 --> 02:00:42.403
I'll hide way up high

02:00:42.486 --> 02:00:45.865
Until the water runs down the pike

02:00:45.948 --> 02:00:49.243
To wash aside all the parasites

02:00:49.326 --> 02:00:52.788
And take the valley back alive

02:00:52.872 --> 02:00:56.667
The tug flows and the rubbish floats

02:00:56.751 --> 02:00:59.336
To hang up on the high oak

02:00:59.420 --> 02:01:01.547
I made this up out of my own free choice.

02:01:02.882 --> 02:01:06.927
And so I haven't regretted it. It's been
an experience. I've got a lot out of it.

02:01:07.011 --> 02:01:10.473
Even if I go down the drain,
I have still come out the winner.

02:01:11.557 --> 02:01:12.975
Still come out a winner.

02:01:13.058 --> 02:01:16.437
Free me, let me go

02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:19.940
They don't recognize a precious stone

02:01:20.024 --> 02:01:23.611
I'll lay low 'til the wet wind blows

02:01:23.694 --> 02:01:27.114
To take me tumblin' down the road

02:01:27.198 --> 02:01:30.826
The wood vines make it hard to fly

02:01:30.910 --> 02:01:33.788
The anchor holds my rope down

02:01:33.871 --> 02:01:38.375
Any idiot can see that
this is a goddamn land grab

02:01:38.459 --> 02:01:42.213
by the city officials using
taxpayers money to tear down buildings

02:01:42.296 --> 02:01:46.133
so that they can give away
the property to the goddamn developers.

02:01:46.217 --> 02:01:48.344
So the developers
will pay 'em off under the table.

02:01:48.427 --> 02:01:51.680
It's not new, but it has gone
as far as we're gonna let it go.
