WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:08.175
THIS PROGRAM IS LOOSELY
BASED ON ACTUAL EVENTS.

00:08.258 --> 00:11.011
CHARACTERS AND EVENTS WERE
ADAPTED FOR DRAMATIC EFFECT.

00:14.306 --> 00:17.392
In Brazil, people think that being a cop

00:17.476 --> 00:20.521
means invading favelas and
shootouts with drug dealers.

00:23.357 --> 00:26.693
FEDERAL POLICE

00:27.277 --> 00:28.737
That's not being a cop.

00:29.905 --> 00:31.573
That's being a stupid cop.

00:35.369 --> 00:38.705
It's not the violence in favelas
that's fucking up our country.

00:39.998 --> 00:44.586
It's not the lack of education,
broken health system,

00:45.504 --> 00:47.631
public deficit or interest rates.

00:49.841 --> 00:53.136
What's fucking up our country is
the cause of all these things.

00:59.643 --> 01:01.311
Twenty years serving the police.

01:02.396 --> 01:03.730
I've never been corrupted.

01:04.147 --> 01:05.649
Never invaded a single favela.

01:08.026 --> 01:09.319
Never been called a hero.

01:15.534 --> 01:17.452
But you know what I've found out?

01:21.081 --> 01:24.042
What's really fucking up
Brazilian people's lives.

01:24.626 --> 01:25.794
It's like a cancer.

01:28.714 --> 01:30.048
A cancer, you know?

01:32.175 --> 01:34.469
If we don't strike at the
root of the problem,

01:36.263 --> 01:37.681
the shit will spread.

01:38.557 --> 01:39.891
Ten B.

01:40.392 --> 01:42.394
Ten billion dollars.

01:42.477 --> 01:44.521
Nineteen bank accounts. I traced four.

01:44.604 --> 01:46.398
Ten billion at the least.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.734
What does he do for a living?

01:50.736 --> 01:51.945
He sells fried pastries.

01:52.821 --> 01:55.449
He used to sell sfihas at a stoplight.

01:55.907 --> 01:57.367
He was Ruffo's classmate.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.786
Unfortunately I went to
school with that prick.

01:59.870 --> 02:02.414
He started smuggling goods
at Friendship Bridge,

02:02.497 --> 02:03.874
then became a drug runner.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.710
But he made a name for himself
with money laundering.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.794
- Want me to get that?
- No, I got it.

02:09.253 --> 02:10.172
Hey, baby.

02:11.256 --> 02:12.132
Regina?

02:12.924 --> 02:14.092
Regina?

02:22.934 --> 02:24.645
Must be my daughter playing.

02:26.938 --> 02:28.857
Twenty years serving the police.

02:30.359 --> 02:33.153
Enough to buy a used car for my wife...

02:33.695 --> 02:36.740
and a ranch in Paraná to
secure my daughter's future.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.458
Ten... billion?

02:46.541 --> 02:49.294
Nice chunk of change, right?
Upper middle class.

02:49.378 --> 02:55.133
More than all drug trafficking
and smuggling in Brazil.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.260
Where's that money coming from?

02:57.636 --> 02:59.388
That's what I plan to find out.

02:59.471 --> 03:00.764
I started the investigation,

03:00.847 --> 03:04.267
but a federal officer can't get
access to offshore accounts.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.853
I took the case to the
Public Prosecutor's Office.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.605
Cláudio and Dimas.

03:08.814 --> 03:11.691
The Public Prosecutor's
Office was my only way in.

03:11.817 --> 03:15.237
If you would be kind enough to
lift Ibrahim's bank secrecy,

03:15.320 --> 03:16.696
this could be a very good day.

03:16.780 --> 03:18.031
Fettucine's on me.

03:19.533 --> 03:20.951
For you, not him.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.287
No one fights a cancer
and walks away unharmed.

03:24.371 --> 03:25.414
No one.

03:25.497 --> 03:27.332
Those pencil-pushers laughed at me.

03:27.707 --> 03:28.708
Cláudio and Dimas.

03:28.792 --> 03:30.710
Today they're considered heroes.

03:31.837 --> 03:34.631
But in the beginning, they
treated me like a lunatic.

03:35.674 --> 03:40.512
- Where did you find this?
- These bank statements...

03:41.221 --> 03:44.349
He's a real son of a bitch. He
shreds and dumps everything.

03:44.933 --> 03:46.476
So I piece it all together.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.938
It's a pain in the ass because
my fingers get sticky.

03:50.564 --> 03:54.025
You salvaged all of this from the trash?

03:54.109 --> 03:55.152
From the trash, yeah.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.989
Your buddy prints out these statements

03:59.072 --> 04:01.658
just to keep you up all night
gluing scraps together.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.369
Ruffo, I can't build a case on this.

04:04.453 --> 04:06.997
And no judge would accept
trash as evidence.

04:08.000 --> 04:14.074

04:22.179 --> 04:23.555
What are you afraid of?

04:24.181 --> 04:27.309
With the Public Prosecutor's
support, I can put an end to this.

04:27.559 --> 04:30.353
Or are you scared to find out
where the money comes from?

05:23.365 --> 05:24.199
Honey.

05:26.368 --> 05:27.202
Are you OK?

05:42.717 --> 05:43.843
Hey, baby.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.220
Regina?

05:46.805 --> 05:47.889
What?

05:49.140 --> 05:52.018
- Regina, where are you?
- Ruffo, where are you going?

05:52.352 --> 05:53.311
Wait.

05:53.395 --> 05:55.605
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

06:35.937 --> 06:38.023
It was an absurd amount of money.

06:41.276 --> 06:44.237
Clearly there was something
sinister behind it all.

06:51.995 --> 06:52.829
Take it easy.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.044
Don't come near my family, buddy.

07:01.630 --> 07:03.340
I don't know what you mean, Ruffo.

07:03.882 --> 07:05.884
Don't come near my daughter.

07:05.967 --> 07:08.303
- But I didn't do anything.
- Your henchmen did.

07:08.386 --> 07:09.596
I didn't do anything.

07:09.679 --> 07:12.432
You can call Motta and find out
if he did anything stupid.

07:12.515 --> 07:15.143
I told him, lawyers are not bodyguards.

07:15.352 --> 07:16.186
But Motta...

07:17.896 --> 07:19.731
You know he has a temper, right?

07:19.814 --> 07:21.816
Don't you come near my wife.

07:22.400 --> 07:25.612
You know I'd never hurt Regina.
She is very dear to me.

07:32.077 --> 07:32.911
I'll kill you!

07:37.457 --> 07:40.293
Ruffo, you're going into one
of your dark phases again.

07:42.504 --> 07:43.630
Everything's fine.

07:44.547 --> 07:47.759
I would appreciate it if
you put the blade away.

08:10.532 --> 08:11.700
Roberto Ibrahim.

08:12.701 --> 08:14.411
The definition of a motherfucker.

08:16.788 --> 08:18.248
What color was the car?

08:20.291 --> 08:22.460
- Black.
- What make?

08:22.544 --> 08:24.129
For God's sake! A black car.

08:24.212 --> 08:25.755
Black, tinted windows...

08:25.839 --> 08:26.881
It was old.

08:27.340 --> 08:28.800
- What's going on?
- Calm down.

08:28.883 --> 08:31.386
Some days ideas just
whizz around in my head.

08:31.469 --> 08:32.761
Marco is going crazy...

08:32.846 --> 08:34.264
I know this upsets me.

08:35.140 --> 08:39.477
Regina thinks I should be
medicated, but I'm not the type.

08:39.561 --> 08:42.105
Verena, they almost killed
our daughter today.

08:43.648 --> 08:46.401
- For how long did they track you?
- I don't know.

08:46.484 --> 08:47.819
If I was less compulsive...

08:47.902 --> 08:49.029
Marco!

08:49.529 --> 08:50.905
I wouldn't be the cop I am.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.035
Ruffo, don't go!

08:55.410 --> 08:57.579
Give me the key! Give it to me.

09:01.374 --> 09:02.208
Drive.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.474
Why go after the guy's family?

09:19.059 --> 09:21.478
You're going to make
him even more furious.

09:22.020 --> 09:23.188
Exactly.

09:23.521 --> 09:26.107
I've known the guy for 30 years, Motta.

09:26.441 --> 09:28.193
I dated his wife back in high school.

09:28.610 --> 09:30.737
A wacko. But I can deal with him.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.447
So, relax.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.283
What's this?

09:35.366 --> 09:38.119
This is abuse of authority,
legal restriction...

09:38.203 --> 09:39.245
Look at that!

09:39.329 --> 09:41.831
Disciplinary action and a
transfer to some hellhole.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.876
See? The more furious he gets,
the more he'll fuck up.

09:44.959 --> 09:47.087
That's just him. He can't
help it, you know?

09:47.170 --> 09:49.672
We have enough to take
him out of the picture.

09:58.848 --> 10:00.433
Just one little nudge...

10:01.142 --> 10:03.103
and he'll shoot himself in the foot.

10:03.603 --> 10:04.646
I don't agree.

10:06.022 --> 10:07.273
- Hello?
- Motta?

10:07.357 --> 10:09.275
Nice bike Ibrahim got you

10:09.359 --> 10:10.902
with the people's money.

10:10.985 --> 10:12.737
- Come to the window, asshole.
- Who?

10:13.029 --> 10:13.863
He's a beggar.

10:17.742 --> 10:19.494
I have two messages for you.

10:19.994 --> 10:22.997
Don't you ever come near my
family again, motherfucker.

10:24.999 --> 10:25.875
And the second?

10:35.802 --> 10:38.638
Stop it, you lunatic!

10:38.888 --> 10:42.225
I'm going to make you lose
your house, you hear?

10:57.073 --> 10:58.575
I'm going to sue him.

10:58.783 --> 10:59.868
I'll buy you a new one.

10:59.951 --> 11:02.245
No need. I'm gonna sue this fucker.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.255
Sometimes my compulsive nature
would get me in trouble.

11:12.755 --> 11:14.257
But what could I do?

11:14.340 --> 11:15.550
Look ahead.

11:16.050 --> 11:17.135
That's it.

11:17.927 --> 11:19.429
A little faster now.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.015
The Public Prosecutors won't cooperate?

11:22.932 --> 11:25.560
Fine. I'll go straight to the judge.

11:25.643 --> 11:26.811
Hold on a sec, darling.

11:27.687 --> 11:28.771
How are you, Deputy?

11:29.564 --> 11:30.773
Is something up?

11:32.191 --> 11:33.192
Dr. Rigo...

11:33.943 --> 11:35.778
Sorry to bother you on a Sunday. Hey.

11:37.488 --> 11:40.158
I need access to Roberto
Ibrahim's accounts.

11:40.241 --> 11:41.451
The currency dealer.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.202
Stop by my office tomorrow.

11:43.286 --> 11:45.413
No, it's urgent. Look at this.

11:45.872 --> 11:48.791
- And the prosecutors?
- They refuse to charge.

11:48.875 --> 11:51.878
- There's nothing I can do for you.
- He's moving billions.

11:52.503 --> 11:55.298
Billions of dollars overseas
through State Bank.

11:55.381 --> 11:56.841
He also threatened my family.

11:58.468 --> 11:59.802
My wife and child.

11:59.928 --> 12:01.596
- You're an officer.
- My daughter...

12:01.679 --> 12:04.515
You have the authority to take
the appropriate measures.

12:05.099 --> 12:06.309
He's a cancer.

12:09.687 --> 12:11.272
Roberto Ibrahim is a cancer.

12:12.774 --> 12:14.901
If we don't act now, the
cancer will spread.

12:15.693 --> 12:18.696
This is neither the time nor
place for this, Deputy.

12:18.780 --> 12:21.282
Don't force me to take
legal action against you.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.035
Let's go, honey.

12:39.342 --> 12:41.386
Rigo called. Our boy is crazy.

12:41.970 --> 12:43.429
He's stalking the judge now.

12:43.930 --> 12:46.182
Look at this mess!

12:46.265 --> 12:50.228
What's more, Ibrahim hired a detective
and filed three lawsuits against him.

12:50.311 --> 12:51.145
I know.

12:51.229 --> 12:52.647
He's rummaging through trash.

12:54.524 --> 12:56.484
- I'll get him transferred.
- Where?

12:56.567 --> 12:58.987
- You can't do that.
- I made a deal with Motta.

12:59.070 --> 13:01.364
He'll be sent to a border post.
Maybe Amapá.

13:01.447 --> 13:05.118
His daughter Beta requires treatment
and he's our best investigator...

13:05.201 --> 13:08.287
Verena, it's either that
or forced retirement.

13:09.914 --> 13:10.832
Come on!

13:10.915 --> 13:14.252
They broke him, Verena. The guy snapped.

13:14.335 --> 13:16.379
Put him on leave, then. Six months.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.965
And who would take over
his investigations?

13:27.598 --> 13:28.766
You can set them there.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.232
What the hell is this?

13:37.650 --> 13:38.526
I'm on vacation.

13:39.235 --> 13:41.112
An elephant steps on a lot of toes.

13:41.195 --> 13:43.364
And Marco Ruffo steps on even more?

13:43.448 --> 13:44.532
Right.

13:44.907 --> 13:46.409
I had to take his cases.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.494
Either that or a transfer to the Amazon.

13:48.578 --> 13:49.579
Yeah, Amazon.

13:51.122 --> 13:54.542
Better the Amazon than
these boxes in the house.

13:55.251 --> 13:57.420
Come on, Regina. Beta!

13:58.546 --> 13:59.922
Verena?

14:00.882 --> 14:02.717
Well, he did say he's a pain in the ass.

14:03.217 --> 14:05.053
- But, Regina...
- Thank you.

14:05.136 --> 14:07.472
It's just six months.
He'll be back, Regina.

14:07.555 --> 14:09.140
Duty calls. I'll explain later.

14:09.223 --> 14:12.226
- No one can know these boxes are here.
- OK. Thanks, Verena.

14:16.522 --> 14:17.357
Honey...

14:32.038 --> 14:36.000
Well, God works in mysterious ways.

14:43.091 --> 14:47.303
For three months, I put scraps of paper
together, reconstructing bank statements.

14:51.265 --> 14:52.266
Until one day...

14:56.771 --> 14:57.855
I found it.

15:01.776 --> 15:02.777
I found it, honey.

15:06.781 --> 15:08.199
Thirty-nine, six hundred.

15:10.284 --> 15:14.664
- Thirty-nine, six hundred.
- Thirty-nine, six hundred.

15:14.747 --> 15:20.169
- Thirty-nine, six hundred.
- Thirty-nine, six hundred.

15:20.753 --> 15:23.172
Thirty-nine million, six hundred.

15:24.048 --> 15:26.676
That number changed the
course of Brazilian history.

15:32.140 --> 15:34.600
At first, I couldn't make
out the whole disease.

15:35.560 --> 15:36.853
I only saw one symptom.

15:37.562 --> 15:40.773
I worked my ass off all day to earn
my measly Federal Police salary.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.944
While the son of a bitch
who didn't even have a job

15:45.027 --> 15:48.531
had fancy cars, a country house,
a yacht, and a private jet.

15:49.991 --> 15:51.659
This is a small branch, right?

15:51.784 --> 15:54.120
But I'd guess it moves a
healthy chunk of change.

15:55.371 --> 15:56.914
Maybe 100, 200, 300 grand?

16:00.460 --> 16:01.961
Not 40 million, though.

16:03.921 --> 16:07.800
I'm no mind-reader, but I imagine
you know Ibrahim, correct?

16:10.511 --> 16:11.345
I do.

16:12.430 --> 16:13.431
You fucked up, right?

16:17.018 --> 16:18.728
Let's undo that fuck-up.

16:23.566 --> 16:27.695
$39.6 million reais in cold cash.

16:28.070 --> 16:31.115
That piece of shit counted it,
put it all in a spinner suitcase

16:31.199 --> 16:33.659
and walked out of the bank
without causing a stir.

16:34.285 --> 16:35.119
Play it again.

16:42.585 --> 16:43.586
Quite the artist.

16:45.963 --> 16:46.964
Freeze it.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.009
- Is he the account holder?
- Yes.

16:50.092 --> 16:52.094
Of course the account wasn't in his name.

16:52.470 --> 16:54.263
Get me a copy and his address.

16:54.347 --> 16:57.016
- That's bank property.
- Better cooperate with the law.

17:01.604 --> 17:05.107
It was in the name of a guy called
Sebastião Barbosa Moreno da Silva.

17:07.443 --> 17:10.820
A farmworker living in
the middle of nowhere.

17:12.573 --> 17:13.741
He's illiterate.

17:15.617 --> 17:17.161
Sebastião could not write.

17:17.244 --> 17:18.412
Good afternoon, ma'am.

17:18.496 --> 17:20.248
I'm looking for Sebastião.

17:20.330 --> 17:23.125
But he deposited $39.6 million reais

17:23.209 --> 17:24.919
in a State Bank account.

17:25.044 --> 17:29.340
He exchanged it into dollars and wired
it to a secret Swiss bank account.

17:29.507 --> 17:31.676
- Sebastião?
- Yes.

17:31.759 --> 17:33.302
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

17:34.095 --> 17:36.013
- Police.
- May I help you?

17:36.722 --> 17:38.516
You may. What do you grow here?

17:39.433 --> 17:40.893
All kinds of things.

17:41.519 --> 17:44.063
Beans. Crops for home cooking.

17:44.772 --> 17:48.192
But the biggest share of
what we sell is cassava.

17:48.276 --> 17:50.611
Fried cassava with rice is good eating.

17:50.695 --> 17:53.072
How much do you make on a good shipment?

17:53.864 --> 17:57.243
Some good money, when
there's a lot of it.

17:58.619 --> 17:59.996
Not 40 million, though.

18:01.831 --> 18:04.333
No, not 40 million.

18:04.417 --> 18:07.128
He might as well have written
"front man" on his forehead.

18:07.211 --> 18:08.296
You fucked up, right?

18:10.131 --> 18:13.217
Well, come with me and
let's undo that fuck-up.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.738
- Who is that?
- No idea.

18:34.530 --> 18:35.906
I should ask you who it is.

18:41.078 --> 18:42.079
Verena!

18:43.623 --> 18:45.916
- Hey.
- Did I wake you, Verena?

18:46.000 --> 18:46.834
No.

18:46.917 --> 18:50.046
Rough climb with no elevators.
Almost had a heart attack. Look.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.715
- What's that?
- What we need to put Ibrahim away.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.925
$39.6 million involved. Let's watch it.

18:55.009 --> 18:56.761
I'll watch it later with Dimas.

18:57.219 --> 18:59.805
- Won't you open the door?
- I have company, Ruffo.

18:59.889 --> 19:01.932
Cláudio, you mean. Let me give him a hug.

19:04.727 --> 19:05.978
Ruffo's here for a visit.

19:16.280 --> 19:17.531
What the hell, sheriff?

19:18.240 --> 19:20.034
Are you arresting me in my undies?

19:22.161 --> 19:23.537
- What's this?
- Movie time.

19:23.621 --> 19:24.455
Scooch over.

19:26.874 --> 19:28.709
- Look who's starring in it.
- No!

19:31.337 --> 19:33.964
- Who's the guy with Ibrahim?
- That's the front man.

19:35.591 --> 19:38.177
Grows cassava, but made a
$39.6 million withdrawal.

19:39.595 --> 19:41.972
- Where did the money end up?
- Take a guess.

19:42.890 --> 19:44.517
He made a deposit at State Bank

19:44.600 --> 19:46.644
then sent it abroad, right?

19:47.186 --> 19:48.104
Asshole.

19:48.771 --> 19:50.481
Look. What a scumbag.

19:50.564 --> 19:52.733
Do you have a warrant
to record this footage?

19:52.817 --> 19:55.069
No, but throw us a bone.

19:55.653 --> 19:57.238
We'll pretend we never saw that,

19:57.488 --> 19:59.365
and then we'll officially watch it.

19:59.532 --> 20:00.616
He's got a nerve.

20:03.786 --> 20:05.079
Rough, right?

20:05.162 --> 20:08.457
If I get you the warrant, will you leave?

20:10.626 --> 20:12.503
No. I loved seeing this interaction...

20:12.586 --> 20:15.423
between the Public Prosecutor's
Office and the Federal Police.

20:16.424 --> 20:18.843
- Can you get us a beer?
- Sure.

20:22.930 --> 20:24.473
What a scumbag. Look at that.

20:35.860 --> 20:36.819
Yes?

20:37.319 --> 20:38.279
Police.

20:38.654 --> 20:40.740
Thirty-five feet, right? Two meters?

20:41.115 --> 20:42.867
OK, get back to me with...

20:43.200 --> 20:44.702
He wants to know the model.

20:44.952 --> 20:48.914
- Hang up the phone, sir.
- Menescal, I have company.

20:49.457 --> 20:50.666
Mr. Roberto Ibrahim?

20:51.167 --> 20:53.586
We have a warrant for
your preventive custody.

20:54.170 --> 20:55.379
On what charges?

20:56.589 --> 20:58.007
Capital flight.

20:59.633 --> 21:02.511
I'll call you later, champ,
but put in that order for me.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.972
Fine. All the best to you.

21:06.182 --> 21:08.184
Cuff him. Go on.

21:17.693 --> 21:19.779
That was the happiest day of my life.

21:21.781 --> 21:25.242
But it was also the day I
found out that in Brazil...

21:28.329 --> 21:29.914
things are never what they seem.

21:46.931 --> 21:49.475
- Can you spare a cigarette?
- I've quit that shit.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.102
Welcome to Fantasy Island.

21:53.145 --> 21:56.148
Rice, beans, and noodles. All cold.

21:56.398 --> 21:59.527
A shitty mattress and a
hole they call a toilet.

22:01.278 --> 22:04.114
You never went to college,
and 15 years is your prize.

22:04.532 --> 22:05.908
Maybe 20, 25.

22:07.034 --> 22:10.955
You'll be in there for so long,
you'll need diapers when you get out.

22:20.089 --> 22:21.423
Take care of yourself, man.

22:24.343 --> 22:25.761
Are you making good money?

22:26.971 --> 22:32.935
Career planning, pension,
health insurance.

22:34.812 --> 22:39.650
This money... Where do you think it goes?

22:41.527 --> 22:43.904
Are you aware of who my lawyer is?

22:46.198 --> 22:47.533
The Minister of Justice.

22:48.325 --> 22:49.827
You know who pays his salary?

22:50.327 --> 22:53.122
The people whose money
passes through my hands.

22:55.291 --> 22:59.169
Meaning Congress. Senators,
congressmen, governors...

22:59.712 --> 23:01.255
The PMDB, PSDB, PT parties...

23:02.172 --> 23:03.882
I'll be there for three days, tops.

23:06.093 --> 23:07.136
Three days.

23:08.053 --> 23:08.887
If at all.

23:11.056 --> 23:12.766
Got any tears inside you to be shed?

23:14.560 --> 23:16.312
Get ready to shed them.

23:17.229 --> 23:18.272
Nogueira, step on it!

23:19.773 --> 23:20.816
Step on it, Nogueira!

23:20.899 --> 23:23.777
Get me out of here! Don't want
to be stuck with this lunatic!

23:23.861 --> 23:25.988
Head to jail, Nogueira! Come on!

23:32.494 --> 23:34.705
- Let me be.
- I let you...

23:35.873 --> 23:40.002
Guess who was the first person to
celebrate Ibrahim being locked up?

23:40.169 --> 23:41.003
That's right.

23:41.086 --> 23:42.087
What's up, sheriff?

23:42.171 --> 23:43.339
Stupid Cláudio.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.925
- Want to celebrate?
- Kudos on the food choice.

23:46.008 --> 23:49.219
The guy who didn't believe me when
I said Ibrahim was a criminal.

23:50.596 --> 23:52.389
Life is like that.

23:52.932 --> 23:55.142
It doesn't always give
credit where it's due.

23:55.225 --> 23:56.852
- This is Cláudio.
- You good?

23:57.436 --> 23:58.687
Her boyfriend.

24:00.397 --> 24:02.399
Sex slave, not boyfriend.

24:03.192 --> 24:04.652
Excuse me. Is it here?

24:04.735 --> 24:06.111
It's here.

24:06.445 --> 24:09.073
Kibbeh, Moroccan rice, tabbouleh...

24:10.324 --> 24:12.451
- "Ummus," baba ghanoush...
- It's hummus.

24:12.534 --> 24:16.914
Hummus, baba ghanoush, open
and close-faced sfihas.

24:17.331 --> 24:20.084
Everything except that dessert.
What's it called?

24:20.167 --> 24:22.294
What are your intentions
with my daughter?

24:22.378 --> 24:23.545
Saw that one coming!

24:24.630 --> 24:27.299
- Is that necessary, Ruffo?
- He's just proud.

24:27.383 --> 24:29.760
- A father's pride.
- I'm not your daughter.

24:31.595 --> 24:34.640
To the sheriff who put the
currency dealer out to pasture.

24:36.016 --> 24:37.142
To the sheriff...

24:37.935 --> 24:40.354
And I'm chopped liver, right? Fine.

24:41.730 --> 24:43.649
- You killed Ibrahim.
- Isn't it enough?

24:44.817 --> 24:47.861
We did way better. We
put him behind bars.

24:48.612 --> 24:49.822
It's over.

24:50.322 --> 24:51.365
So how was it?

24:52.199 --> 24:53.200
What?

24:54.243 --> 24:55.786
What did the currency dealer say?

24:56.870 --> 24:58.580
Guys, this is delicious.

24:59.581 --> 25:02.334
Chatting with your childhood
pal after all these years.

25:02.418 --> 25:04.211
- At the back of the truck?
- Yeah.

25:05.254 --> 25:07.506
- I can't tell you.
- Come on! Spill it.

25:07.923 --> 25:08.924
It's personal.

25:11.051 --> 25:14.138
"Vengeance is never the end. It
kills and poisons the soul."

25:14.930 --> 25:16.932
He's tight with the Minister of Justice.

25:17.015 --> 25:18.767
The Judicial Branch is a shitshow.

25:18.851 --> 25:23.188
The sole institution which may
be called serious and honest...

25:23.605 --> 25:25.399
is the Public Prosecutor's Office.

25:31.613 --> 25:34.324
Your client left a bank with
$39 million in a briefcase,

25:34.408 --> 25:36.118
deposited the sum at a second bank,

25:36.201 --> 25:38.203
exchanged it, and sent it abroad.

25:38.287 --> 25:39.663
All this was caught on tape.

25:40.122 --> 25:41.957
Did you expect Rigo to let that slide?

25:43.584 --> 25:45.252
Ibrahim cannot remain confined.

25:45.335 --> 25:48.046
Brasília has called three times already.
What can I do?

25:48.130 --> 25:50.382
My husband eating prison slop?
That won't do.

25:50.466 --> 25:53.260
I've already authorized take-out
boxes and a cell phone.

25:53.552 --> 25:54.887
The rest is up to you.

26:03.937 --> 26:07.858
So you are proposing a plea bargain?

26:07.941 --> 26:11.445
Precisely. Ibrahim tells all he knows.

26:11.695 --> 26:13.405
You can ask whatever you want.

26:13.489 --> 26:15.282
Take that information to the judge,

26:15.365 --> 26:17.993
and if that is of any
interest, he's released.

26:18.619 --> 26:20.078
- What do you mean?
- Deputy...

26:20.162 --> 26:21.330
Do you only care about...

26:21.413 --> 26:23.749
- What deal is this?
- Is he free to chime in?

26:26.168 --> 26:29.171
You are not part of this
conversation, Deputy.

26:34.635 --> 26:36.512
The guy wasn't willing to help me.

26:36.595 --> 26:39.139
And then made a deal with Ibrahim's wife.

26:40.516 --> 26:42.810
What did he think he was
going to get out of that?

26:43.227 --> 26:45.020
The President's fall?

26:52.402 --> 26:55.989
We'll hear what he has to
say, but no guarantees.

26:56.073 --> 26:59.284
It's not the Public Prosecution's call.
We will hear you out.

26:59.535 --> 27:01.620
Depending on what you have to tell us,

27:02.204 --> 27:05.332
we'll forward it to Rigo and
he'll decide what to do.

27:06.166 --> 27:08.001
- I know this man.
- Deputy.

27:08.168 --> 27:09.211
Since before she did.

27:11.213 --> 27:13.090
He's going to give you the runaround.

27:13.173 --> 27:14.925
- Ruffo!
- I am not on board with this.

27:20.556 --> 27:22.140
You gave him your word.

27:22.224 --> 27:24.101
It can't hurt to hear what he has to say.

27:24.184 --> 27:26.061
Ruffo spent so much time after the guy...

27:26.144 --> 27:28.605
- You can't do this to him.
- It's not about Ruffo.

27:28.689 --> 27:31.108
Yeah, Cláudio. It's about what's right.

27:31.191 --> 27:32.192
Ibrahim is bad news.

27:33.485 --> 27:34.903
He'll always be bad news.

27:35.362 --> 27:37.197
There's no deal with people like him.

27:44.162 --> 27:46.081
Too much ambition fucks everything up.

27:52.504 --> 27:54.423
Does the Defense have anything to add?

27:56.091 --> 27:57.009
No, Your Honor.

27:57.092 --> 27:59.386
Any statements from the
Public Prosecution?

27:59.469 --> 28:02.055
Ibrahim wasn't going to
throw anyone under the bus.

28:02.806 --> 28:04.016
But Cláudio...

28:04.099 --> 28:05.058
No, Your Honor.

28:05.142 --> 28:07.311
wasn't the only ambitious one.

28:08.145 --> 28:11.189
If the parties involved
agree to the terms,

28:11.273 --> 28:13.650
I hereby approve the plea bargain deal

28:13.734 --> 28:15.569
between defendant Roberto Ibrahim,

28:16.320 --> 28:17.487
the Public Prosecution,

28:17.571 --> 28:22.409
and Paraná's Federal Police, in the
State Bank capital flight case.

28:22.492 --> 28:24.328
Judge Rigo was even worse.

28:27.581 --> 28:29.750
You're under arrest for
defacing property.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.128
Take the deputy away, please.

29:12.084 --> 29:13.252
What are you doing here?

29:15.545 --> 29:18.298
You're finished, man.
Official notice and all.

29:19.258 --> 29:22.678
You have five minutes to get out,
otherwise I'll have you dragged out.

29:27.808 --> 29:31.520
What would I do when those ideas started
whizzing around in my head again?

29:53.166 --> 29:56.086
No one fights a cancer
and walks away unharmed.

29:56.169 --> 29:57.004
No one.

30:02.217 --> 30:04.011
Twenty years in the Force,

30:05.512 --> 30:07.681
and all I got was a used car for my wife

30:08.181 --> 30:09.725
and a ranch in the countryside.

31:18.502 --> 31:19.378
Hi.

31:20.253 --> 31:21.254
How's he holding up?

31:22.297 --> 31:23.590
Ruffo was my mentor.

31:24.383 --> 31:26.134
- I'll go see him.
- He's in the garage.

31:26.218 --> 31:29.971
I couldn't let him deal with it
by himself. But it was difficult.

31:30.055 --> 31:32.599
I was always walking on
eggshells, watching what I said.

31:41.817 --> 31:43.318
You're a carpenter now, Ruffo?

31:56.540 --> 31:57.499
Let me guess.

31:59.960 --> 32:02.170
Justice authorized Ibrahim's plea deal,

32:02.254 --> 32:04.881
but he failed to give you any
big fish, no politicians.

32:06.883 --> 32:09.010
Next, he called the
Minister of Justice...

32:09.094 --> 32:12.597
who called the Pope, and
he remains at large.

32:18.603 --> 32:21.314
- Your boyfriend must be happy.
- He's not my boyfriend.

32:28.905 --> 32:30.574
Don't do anything stupid, OK?

32:32.826 --> 32:35.036
He could do something
crazy at any moment.

32:35.996 --> 32:38.999
Towards others, or towards himself.

32:54.055 --> 32:56.057
Ruffo's story is a hard one to tell.

32:57.309 --> 32:59.853
Every time I remember it,
I feel fucking anguished.

33:36.306 --> 33:39.059
Ten years later, Brasília
was celebrating.

33:39.559 --> 33:42.646
It would be the third consecutive
term for a popular party.

33:43.104 --> 33:45.607
A government that called
itself "different."

33:46.775 --> 33:48.401
But I had learned from Ruffo.

33:49.152 --> 33:50.445
They never fooled me.

33:51.112 --> 33:54.032
To me, that government
was just like any other.

33:54.115 --> 33:56.243
Never before in this country's history

33:56.326 --> 33:59.412
has a president done so much
for the Brazilian people

33:59.496 --> 34:01.623
as our comrade Janete.

34:01.706 --> 34:06.503
- In ten years we achieved the impossible...
- Pardon me, Mr. President.

34:06.795 --> 34:08.088
"In ten years,

34:08.170 --> 34:12.007
we achieved what many
deemed to be impossible."

34:12.092 --> 34:14.302
- Simple as that, Mr. President.
- OK.

34:14.386 --> 34:15.762
"On the energy front,

34:15.844 --> 34:18.931
Petrobrasil is going to
explore the pre-salt layer,

34:19.014 --> 34:20.976
but we didn't forget the environment."

34:21.059 --> 34:24.312
One other thing bugging me is this set.

34:24.396 --> 34:26.022
This is garbage!

34:26.106 --> 34:28.315
It has nothing to do with our voters.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.819
Sir, it's a typical
middle-class apartment.

34:30.902 --> 34:33.154
- No!
- We're selling them on this.

34:33.237 --> 34:36.491
Too much luxury, too many books!
This is a bourgeois household.

34:36.574 --> 34:39.536
"We invested heavily in wind power.

34:39.619 --> 34:43.164
I ordered the development
of a new technology

34:43.248 --> 34:44.416
to stockpile wind."

34:44.498 --> 34:46.918
Madam President, try it
again from Tony's script.

34:47.002 --> 34:48.837
- He insisted on it.
- Is it too much?

34:48.920 --> 34:50.672
- What?
- My hair.

34:51.464 --> 34:53.216
- Mr. President...
- It's nonsense.

34:53.300 --> 34:55.510
- Let it go.
- It won't work!

34:55.802 --> 34:57.512
Thames, my dear!

34:59.598 --> 35:00.432
How are things?

35:00.515 --> 35:02.392
- How are you?
- Very well, and you?

35:02.475 --> 35:03.476
I'm fine.

35:03.685 --> 35:07.564
Those people from Goiânia
won't stop calling.

35:07.647 --> 35:09.149
- The butchers.
- Butchers?

35:09.232 --> 35:11.901
Don't worry about them.
They're trustworthy.

35:12.235 --> 35:13.820
You can take them in.

35:13.903 --> 35:16.740
This will only add to our cause.
Rest easy.

35:17.032 --> 35:18.283
Janete, my dear!

35:18.366 --> 35:20.243
I never believed the ex-President.

35:20.785 --> 35:22.954
Never liked the Vice-President candidate,

35:23.038 --> 35:25.582
and I've always been
suspicious of the President.

35:26.875 --> 35:27.709
What is it?

35:28.585 --> 35:31.087
That's 43 down from the
Nobleman's spreadsheet.

35:31.296 --> 35:33.590
- He's pissing and moaning.
- Why is he moaning?

35:33.673 --> 35:36.926
We got this in the first round,
but we're not miracle workers.

35:37.010 --> 35:38.887
How am I supposed to make up for the 600?

35:38.970 --> 35:40.889
Relax, Duda. I'm taking care of it.

35:41.222 --> 35:42.557
Ruffo was right.

35:43.516 --> 35:46.561
Cancer is cancer.

35:49.648 --> 35:53.151
If you don't remove it
quickly, it spreads.

35:57.238 --> 35:58.990
Duda is a pain in the ass.

35:59.074 --> 36:02.661
Ten years later, Ibrahim was
still free, living in Brasília,

36:02.744 --> 36:04.537
hanging with big shots.

36:04.621 --> 36:07.082
I'm not that young. What if I stopped?

36:07.165 --> 36:08.249
Have you thought of it?

36:08.333 --> 36:11.836
- Your work is too stressful.
- I'm holding it together, huh?

36:11.920 --> 36:13.755
It's not worth it for so little money.

36:13.838 --> 36:17.217
I'll give you some upfront.
Say 500? This week?

36:17.300 --> 36:18.968
Six hundred, darling.

36:19.052 --> 36:20.679
- Six hundred, today?
- Right now.

36:20.762 --> 36:23.556
His office was on top of a gas station.

36:23.973 --> 36:25.392
The Antenna Gas Station.

36:26.142 --> 36:29.854
That's where he operated from.
He and his posse.

36:29.938 --> 36:31.189
How's it going, cousin?

36:32.273 --> 36:33.358
Chebab...

36:33.441 --> 36:34.859
Has Sophia Loren come in yet?

36:35.360 --> 36:36.861
Yes, in yesterday's clothes.

36:36.945 --> 36:37.779
and Kitano.

36:38.363 --> 36:39.656
So much booze on her breath

36:39.739 --> 36:42.158
she could have blown the
whole place sky-high.

36:42.242 --> 36:44.369
They only talked on cell phones.

36:44.452 --> 36:46.746
Tell her I need some back-up here.

36:46.830 --> 36:49.874
And used voice distortion so
they wouldn't be recognized.

36:49.958 --> 36:51.418
- How much?
- Six hundred.

36:51.501 --> 36:53.044
Again? She'll be pissed.

36:55.296 --> 36:56.715
Tell her to give him cash

36:56.798 --> 36:58.842
and the Nobleman will pay her later.

36:58.925 --> 37:02.011
Hurry, cousin. I dread being
left alone with this woman.

37:05.348 --> 37:06.808
They need 600 up front.

37:07.016 --> 37:09.060
- Who's covering?
- The Nobleman.

37:10.437 --> 37:11.396
600 NOBLEMAN

37:11.479 --> 37:13.732
Ibrahim was a smart son of a bitch.

37:14.524 --> 37:15.859
There's no denying it.

37:16.818 --> 37:19.779
Who could imagine that a cheap
currency exchange store

37:19.863 --> 37:21.406
on top of a crappy jet wash

37:21.489 --> 37:24.200
was moving the financing resources

37:24.284 --> 37:26.661
of the richest presidential
campaign in Brazil?

37:31.040 --> 37:32.500
They get easy money.

37:32.792 --> 37:35.545
Just change the woman's glasses,
the color of her dress,

37:36.087 --> 37:38.173
comb the hair, play a
jingle, and it's done.

37:39.716 --> 37:42.177
Writing a president's
speech must not be easy.

37:42.260 --> 37:44.596
With the money they get?
I'd write it in Russian!

37:44.679 --> 37:46.264
It was a well-oiled machine.

37:46.431 --> 37:48.725
Some candy, cousin.

37:48.933 --> 37:51.895
Chebab worked out the
slush fund accounting

37:51.978 --> 37:54.981
and Kitano took care
of the fund transfers.

37:55.064 --> 37:57.400
Hey, how did last night end?

37:57.650 --> 37:59.235
With vows of everlasting love.

37:59.486 --> 38:02.030
They used hard cash
every time they could.

38:02.363 --> 38:03.948
So it wouldn't leave traces.

38:06.409 --> 38:08.828
Fuck. Six hundred at such short notice?

38:08.912 --> 38:11.623
Dudinha. You know him. Fucking amateur.

38:12.415 --> 38:15.877
Can't even make a spreadsheet. The
Nobleman will cover it, no problem.

38:18.588 --> 38:20.673
Every Thursday they switched phones,

38:21.800 --> 38:23.718
like American drug-runners.

38:24.552 --> 38:26.012
Fucking hard to trace.

38:43.196 --> 38:44.531
It ends with 77 now.

38:51.871 --> 38:52.914
Done, boss.

38:54.082 --> 38:57.252
Rip it up and throw it out.
They changed the SIM card.

39:05.802 --> 39:06.678
What day is today?

39:07.595 --> 39:08.429
Thursday.

39:09.013 --> 39:11.558
- The same thing happened last week.
- I know.

39:12.141 --> 39:15.186
They have a fixed routine. It's
a well-structured operation.

39:15.270 --> 39:16.938
They have structure and money.

39:17.021 --> 39:18.940
Six hundred grand? It's serious money.

39:27.156 --> 39:30.368
Let's track everything again. Do it.

39:31.286 --> 39:33.746
Tap the phones... Cut them loose.

39:33.830 --> 39:35.206
Fucking hard work.

39:39.043 --> 39:41.129
I've just closed the books for the week.

39:42.005 --> 39:43.715
We moved 54 million...

39:43.798 --> 39:45.008
The landline was easier.

39:45.091 --> 39:48.177
But they never used it, so
it was of no use to us.

39:48.261 --> 39:49.387
Right now I can't...

39:49.596 --> 39:50.680
Oh, shit!

39:51.472 --> 39:53.850
But God works in mysterious ways.

40:05.862 --> 40:07.572
A little more efficient, please.

40:08.698 --> 40:10.283
Hold on. Just a second.

40:16.748 --> 40:19.876
- Hello?
- Cousin?

40:19.959 --> 40:21.336
- Ibra?
- Hello, Chebab.

40:21.419 --> 40:24.130
We had an accident here. Call
the landline if you need.

40:24.505 --> 40:25.548
I'll explain later.

40:39.854 --> 40:41.814
If Brazil were a serious country,

40:41.898 --> 40:45.193
and the people who worked hard for
their money were respected...

40:50.990 --> 40:53.326
If there were such a
thing as divine justice

40:53.451 --> 40:55.662
and Good could overcome
Evil every time...

40:59.165 --> 41:03.294
If things had been different and
Ruffo were still with us...

41:08.633 --> 41:10.927
But there's no justice in Brazil.

41:13.054 --> 41:15.932
God doesn't exist and he isn't Brazilian.

41:20.436 --> 41:22.105
And you can't turn back the clock.

41:24.524 --> 41:25.942
- Boss.
- Yes.

41:27.110 --> 41:28.152
The Cousin has a name.

41:28.653 --> 41:30.029
Weren't the phone taps down?

41:30.113 --> 41:33.116
They were, but Chebab called
Ibra from a landline.

41:33.533 --> 41:35.576
- Called who?
- Ibra.

41:36.703 --> 41:41.416
Ten years later, fate gave me the
chance to capture Ibrahim for good.

41:44.752 --> 41:46.379
And Ruffo wasn't with us anymore.

41:47.630 --> 41:50.883
I was not Ruffo. I never would be.

41:52.385 --> 41:54.095
But I owed this to him.
