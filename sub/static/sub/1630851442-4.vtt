00:03.486 --> 00:05.350
Support your local PBS station.

00:32.170 --> 00:35.242
HE RULES THE NIGHT SPACE
EVEN NOW,

00:35.276 --> 00:38.728
BESTRIDES THE TREACHEROUS DOMAIN
WITH THIGHS OF BRONZE.

00:38.762 --> 00:41.110
A DANCING MURAL OF DELIGHTS.

00:41.144 --> 00:45.355
OH, ALI, ALI...

00:45.390 --> 00:49.221
WHAT MUSIC HURTS THE MASSIVE
HEAD TONIGHT, ALI?

00:49.256 --> 00:53.432
THE DRUMS, THE TIN CANS,
THE GUITARS

00:53.467 --> 00:55.607
AND MBIRA OF ZAIRE?

00:55.641 --> 00:59.128
ALI, ALI, BOMAYE.

00:59.162 --> 01:01.475
THE RUMBLE IN THE JUNGLE?

01:01.509 --> 01:03.718
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST?

01:03.753 --> 01:05.824
ROLL CALL OF BUM-A-MONTH.

01:05.858 --> 01:07.412
THE ROPE-A-DOPE?

01:07.446 --> 01:09.138
THE THRILLA IN MANILLA?

01:09.172 --> 01:11.795
ALI, ALI.

01:11.830 --> 01:15.385
"THE CLOSEST THING
TO DEATH," YOU SAID.

01:15.420 --> 01:20.252
WAS THAT THE GREATEST,
SADDEST PROPHECY OF ALL?

01:32.713 --> 01:36.717
BY THE SUMMER OF 1974,
THE UNITED STATES WAS BESET

01:36.751 --> 01:38.788
BY A CRIPPLING OIL EMBARGO,

01:38.822 --> 01:42.930
SKYROCKETING INFLATION THAT HAD
STAGGERED THE AMERICAN ECONOMY,

01:42.964 --> 01:46.451
AND A CORRUPT
AND SCANDAL-PLAGUED PRESIDENT.

01:48.211 --> 01:49.661
THERE'S
THE PRESIDENT WAVING GOOD-BYE.

01:49.695 --> 01:51.387
YOU CAN HEAR THE APPLAUSE.

01:53.389 --> 01:56.254
AS COURT-ORDERED
DESEGREGATION OF SCHOOLS

01:56.288 --> 01:58.359
SPREAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY

01:58.394 --> 02:01.190
AND WHITE PEOPLE CONTINUED
LEAVING CITIES FOR THE SUBURBS,

02:01.224 --> 02:02.708
SOME BLACK ACTIVISTS

02:02.743 --> 02:04.400
WHO HAD MARCHED AND PROTESTED--

02:04.434 --> 02:06.367
OR EVEN TAKEN UP ARMS--

02:06.402 --> 02:08.197
TURNED TO POLITICS

02:08.231 --> 02:11.200
IN HOPES OF ACHIEVING CHANGE.

02:11.234 --> 02:14.203
ELECTORAL POLITICS BECAME
MUCH MORE IMPORTANT.

02:14.237 --> 02:16.688
A LOT OF BLACK MAYORS
WERE BEGINNING TO BE ELECTED.

02:16.722 --> 02:20.726
MORE TRADITIONAL ROUTES OF
EMPOWERMENT WERE EMPLOYED.

02:20.761 --> 02:24.213
AND I THINK THE COUNTRY
CONCLUDED

02:24.247 --> 02:26.215
THAT VIETNAM WAS A MISTAKE

02:26.249 --> 02:30.702
AND THAT MAYBE ALI WAS PRESCIENT
IN HIS REFUSAL TO GO.

02:30.736 --> 02:35.258
MUHAMMAD ALI'S LOSS
TO JOE FRAZIER IN 1971

02:35.293 --> 02:38.813
AND THEN HIS COMEBACK VICTORY IN
THEIR REMATCH THREE YEARS LATER

02:38.848 --> 02:40.953
HAD SOFTENED PERCEPTIONS OF HIM,

02:40.988 --> 02:44.612
EVEN AMONG THOSE
WHO HAD ONCE DESPISED ALI.

02:44.647 --> 02:48.202
HE CONTINUED TO VENERATE
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD,

02:48.237 --> 02:51.723
THE 77-YEAR-OLD LEADER OF
THE NATION OF ISLAM.

02:51.757 --> 02:55.382
THOUGH THE SECT HAD RECEDED
FROM PUBLIC VIEW, IT HAD,

02:55.416 --> 02:59.903
IN FACT, EXPANDED, WITH OVER
70 MOSQUES ACROSS THE COUNTRY,

02:59.938 --> 03:02.561
MORE THAN 200,000 MEMBERS,

03:02.596 --> 03:04.598
AND A BUSINESS EMPIRE

03:04.632 --> 03:08.602
WITH ASSETS IN
THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

03:08.636 --> 03:12.606
IF YOU THINK THE WORLD WAS
SURPRISED WHEN NIXON RESIGNED,

03:12.640 --> 03:14.918
WAIT TILL I WHIP
FOREMAN'S BEHIND.

03:17.058 --> 03:19.268
HE'S SLOW.
HE HAS NO SKILL,

03:19.302 --> 03:21.028
NO FOOTWORK. HE'S AWKWARD.

03:21.062 --> 03:23.306
AND I HAVE GIVEN HIM
A NAME.

03:23.341 --> 03:25.343
I NAMED FLOYD PATTERSON
"THE RABBIT."

03:25.377 --> 03:27.414
I NAMED
SONNY LISTON "THE BEAR."

03:27.448 --> 03:30.658
AND HE SHALL BE KNOWN
OFFICIALLY AS "THE MUMMY."

03:32.039 --> 03:33.385
THE MUMMY.

03:33.420 --> 03:35.629
WHY "THE MUMMY?"

03:35.663 --> 03:38.252
WHY? BECAUSE HE FIGHTS--
WHEN HE'S FIGHTING,

03:38.287 --> 03:40.703
IF YOU EVER WATCH HIM
IN THE RING, HE--

03:40.737 --> 03:42.808
HE DRAGS LIKE THAT
AFTER HIS OPPONENT.

03:45.397 --> 03:48.573
CONSIDERED A LONGSHOT
IN HIS UPCOMING TITLE MATCH

03:48.607 --> 03:51.817
IN ZAIRE, IN AFRICA,
ALI PROMOTED HIMSELF

03:51.852 --> 03:55.511
AS A CHAMPION OF
BLACK NATIONALISM AND ISLAM,

03:55.545 --> 03:58.755
AND THIS TIME DERIDED
HIS OPPONENT, GEORGE FOREMAN,

03:58.790 --> 04:00.619
THE CURRENT UNDEFEATED

04:00.654 --> 04:02.483
HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION
OF THE WORLD,

04:02.518 --> 04:06.418
AS "THE CHRISTIAN"
AND THE WHITE MAN'S HOPE.

04:06.453 --> 04:09.594
ALI MAKES THE STAKES
VERY HIGH IN THIS FIGHT.

04:09.628 --> 04:11.906
THIS IS THE FIGHT
ABOUT THE BLACK WORLD.

04:11.941 --> 04:14.081
THIS IS A FIGHT ABOUT
THE WHOLE BLACK WORLD

04:14.115 --> 04:15.565
COMING TOGETHER, WHO'S
GOING TO BE THE CHAMPION

04:15.600 --> 04:17.498
OF THE BLACK WORLD.

04:17.533 --> 04:20.639
AND HE SAYS,
"FOREMAN IS NOT THIS.

04:20.674 --> 04:22.814
"FOREMAN IS THE WHITE MAN'S
CHAMPION,

04:22.848 --> 04:26.887
AND I'M THE CHAMPION
OF THE THIRD WORLD."

04:26.921 --> 04:31.063
FOR ME, GEORGE FOREMAN
HAS ALWAYS BEEN

04:31.098 --> 04:34.895
WHAT I WOULD CALL
A COUNTERREVOLUTIONARY FIGHTER.

04:34.929 --> 04:38.588
AT THE SAME 1968 OLYMPICS
WHERE CARLOS AND SMITH

04:38.623 --> 04:41.971
RAISED THE CLENCHED BLACK FIST,
IT IS GEORGE FOREMAN

04:42.005 --> 04:45.008
WHO PULLS THE AMERICAN FLAG
OUT OF HIS TRUNKS

04:45.043 --> 04:49.806
AND STARTS WAVING IT AROUND
AFTER HE WINS A GOLD MEDAL.

04:49.841 --> 04:53.569
SO IN SOME WAYS, IT'S NECESSARY

04:53.603 --> 04:59.747
FOR MUHAMMAD ALI TO FIGHT
GEORGE FOREMAN IN ZAIRE IN 1974,

04:59.782 --> 05:03.061
BECAUSE ALI IS THE ULTIMATE
REVOLUTIONARY ATHLETE

05:03.095 --> 05:06.892
FIGHTING THE
COUNTERREVOLUTIONARY ATHLETE.

05:06.927 --> 05:08.860
I'M REPRESENTING GOD.

05:08.894 --> 05:11.828
I'M REPRESENTING THE FREEDOM
OF BLACK PEOPLE IN AMERICA.

05:11.863 --> 05:14.831
I WANT TO WIN SO I CAN COME
HOME AND SPEAK FOR THE BROTHER

05:14.866 --> 05:16.488
WHO'S LIVING IN RAT-INFESTED
HOUSES,

05:16.523 --> 05:18.870
SLEEPING ON CONCRETE
IN THE GHETTO,

05:18.904 --> 05:22.529
CAN'T GO ON TELEVISION
TO SPEAK.

05:22.563 --> 05:24.427
SO THIS FOR ME IS A HOLY WAR.

05:24.462 --> 05:27.741
THIS AIN'T JUST NO FIGHT
WITH GEORGE FOREMAN.

05:27.775 --> 05:30.053
I'M FIGHTING FOR
THE FREEDOM AND EQUALITY

05:30.088 --> 05:33.781
OF THE BLACK MAN OF AMERICA.

05:46.069 --> 05:50.142
ON JULY 17, 1974,
MUHAMMAD ALI INVITED

05:50.177 --> 05:53.801
A BUSLOAD OF REPORTERS AND THEIR
FAMILIES TO A PICNIC LUNCH

05:53.836 --> 05:55.596
AT HIS TRAINING CAMP

05:55.631 --> 05:58.979
IN THE POCONO MOUNTAINS OF
EASTERN PENNSYLVANIA.

05:59.013 --> 06:02.016
IT HAD BEEN EIGHT WEEKS
SINCE HE'D BEGUN TRAINING

06:02.051 --> 06:03.742
FOR GEORGE FOREMAN,

06:03.777 --> 06:06.745
AND THOUGH ALI HAD ALREADY
TRIMMED TEN POUNDS

06:06.780 --> 06:10.542
FROM HIS 6'3" FRAME,
HE HOPED TO LOSE ANOTHER TEN

06:10.577 --> 06:12.786
IN THE TWO MONTHS
BEFORE THEIR TITLE FIGHT

06:12.820 --> 06:15.616
IN KINSHASA, ZAIRE,
IN SEPTEMBER.

06:15.651 --> 06:17.653
I DON'T HAVE NO MANAGERS,
NO BOSSES.

06:17.687 --> 06:20.552
I RUN WHEN I WANT TO RUN, TRAIN
AS LONG AS I WANT TO TRAIN...

06:20.587 --> 06:23.762
ALI, NOW 32 YEARS OLD,

06:23.797 --> 06:27.214
TOLD JOKES AND STORIES
JUST AS HE ALWAYS HAD.

06:27.248 --> 06:28.974
HE RECITED POETRY,

06:29.009 --> 06:31.770
ORDERED HIS SPARRING PARTNERS
TO PUMMEL HIM...

06:31.805 --> 06:33.427
KEEP BLASTING.

06:33.462 --> 06:34.911
...AND PROMISED REPORTERS

06:34.946 --> 06:38.225
THAT FOREMAN "CAN'T HURT
WHAT HE CAN'T HIT."

06:38.259 --> 06:42.816
"BET THE HOUSE ON ME,"
HE TOLD THEM.

06:42.850 --> 06:45.681
FOR THIS FIGHT, I'VE
WRASSLED WITH ALLIGATORS.

06:45.715 --> 06:47.579
I'VE TUSSLED WITH A WHALE.

06:47.614 --> 06:50.651
I DONE HANDCUFFED LIGHTNING
AND PUT THUNDER IN JAIL.

06:50.686 --> 06:52.101
YOU KNOW I'M BAD.

06:52.135 --> 06:55.587
I HAVE MURDERED A ROCK,
I INJURED A STONE,

06:55.622 --> 06:57.831
AND I HOSPITALIZED A BRICK.

06:57.865 --> 07:00.005
I'M SO BAD, I MAKE
MEDICINE SICK.

07:00.040 --> 07:02.732
I'M SO FAST, MAN, I CAN
RUN THROUGH A HURRICANE

07:02.767 --> 07:04.251
AND DON'T GET WET.

07:04.285 --> 07:06.840
WHEN GEORGE FOREMAN MEETS
ME, HE'LL PAY HIS DEBT.

07:06.874 --> 07:10.464
I CAN DROWN A DRINK OF WATER
AND KILL A DEAD TREE.

07:10.499 --> 07:12.811
WAIT TILL YOU SEE
MUHAMMAD ALI.

07:22.096 --> 07:27.170
MOBUTU SESE SEKO IS
THE DICTATOR IN ZAIRE,

07:27.205 --> 07:29.794
WHICH HAD PREVIOUSLY
BEEN KNOWN AS THE CONGO,

07:29.828 --> 07:32.831
THE BELGIAN CONGO
WHEN IT WAS COLONIZED.

07:32.866 --> 07:37.664
MOBUTU WILL STAGE
THIS LEGENDARY BOXING MATCH

07:37.698 --> 07:41.150
IN A LOCATION THAT'S, OF COURSE,
QUITE SYMBOLIC

07:41.184 --> 07:46.189
BECAUSE OF THE RISING
CONSCIOUSNESS AROUND AFRICA,

07:46.224 --> 07:49.710
PARTICULARLY FOR MANY
AFRICAN AMERICANS.

07:49.745 --> 07:52.679
MOBUTU SESE SEKO,
THE PRESIDENT OF ZAIRE,

07:52.713 --> 07:54.232
HAD COME TO POWER

07:54.266 --> 07:57.097
IN A BELGIAN- AND
AMERICAN-BACKED MILITARY COUP

07:57.131 --> 07:58.719
THAT OVERTHREW

07:58.754 --> 08:00.928
THE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED
GOVERNMENT.

08:00.963 --> 08:04.207
HE ROUTINELY TORTURED
AND KILLED HIS OPPONENTS,

08:04.242 --> 08:06.934
AND AMASSED AN ENORMOUS
PERSONAL FORTUNE,

08:06.969 --> 08:08.626
SIPHONING THE PROFITS

08:08.660 --> 08:10.662
FROM THE COUNTRY'S
BOOMING MINING INDUSTRY

08:10.697 --> 08:12.319
INTO OFFSHORE BANK ACCOUNTS,

08:12.353 --> 08:15.080
WHILE MANY ZAIRIANS SCRAPED BY

08:15.115 --> 08:18.187
WITHOUT ELECTRICITY
OR RUNNING WATER.

08:18.221 --> 08:23.261
MUHAMMAD ALI AND GEORGE FOREMAN
ACCEPTED MOBUTU'S MILLIONS.

08:23.295 --> 08:25.194
HE HAD ALL THE MONEY,

08:25.228 --> 08:28.577
ONE OF THE RICHEST DICTATORS
AT THE TIME IN THE WORLD,

08:28.611 --> 08:30.268
AND SO NOW HE HAD OPPORTUNITY

08:30.302 --> 08:32.304
TO BRING HIS PEOPLE
IN HIS COUNTRY

08:32.339 --> 08:35.238
TO THE FOREFRONT OF THE WORLD.

08:35.273 --> 08:37.344
THAT'S WHAT DICTATORS DO.

08:37.378 --> 08:39.311
THEY STAGE EXTRAVAGANZAS

08:39.346 --> 08:42.867
TO DISTRACT PEOPLE
AWAY FROM THEIR MISERY

08:42.901 --> 08:46.664
AND ALSO TO FOCUS THE WRONG
KIND OF ATTENTION--

08:46.698 --> 08:49.908
THEY THINK IS THE RIGHT
ONE--ON THEMSELVES.

08:49.943 --> 08:55.086
HE'S A DESPICABLE, EXTRAVAGANT
CHARACTER WHO OWNS

08:55.120 --> 08:57.606
NOT JUST HOUSES
BUT STREETS OF HOUSES

08:57.640 --> 09:03.197
IN THE HOME COUNTRY
OF HIS BOSSES, THE BELGIANS.

09:03.232 --> 09:07.754
HE USED TO IMPORT CARTONS
AND CARTONS OF CHAMPAGNE,

09:07.788 --> 09:10.170
SPECIALLY BOTTLED FOR HIM.

09:10.204 --> 09:14.623
HE DRANK NOTHING ELSE BUT THAT
PARTICULAR BRAND FOR BREAKFAST.

09:14.657 --> 09:16.314
THAT'S THE KIND OF INDIVIDUAL
HE WAS.

09:26.151 --> 09:27.981
ON SEPTEMBER 10th,

09:28.015 --> 09:30.708
ALI ALONG WITH HIS WIFE
BELINDA, HIS BROTHER RAHMAN,

09:30.742 --> 09:32.710
HIS MOTHER AND FATHER,

09:32.744 --> 09:36.265
AS WELL AS AN ENTOURAGE OF
2 DOZEN FRIENDS AND ASSOCIATES,

09:36.299 --> 09:40.959
ARRIVED IN KINSHASA
ABOARD MOBUTU'S PRIVATE PLANE.

09:40.994 --> 09:44.825
"FOREMAN IS A STRANGER COMING
TO MY HOME TO FIGHT ME,"

09:44.860 --> 09:46.827
HE TOLD A CROWD OF
5,000 ZAIRIANS

09:46.862 --> 09:48.622
WHO WERE THERE TO GREET HIM.

09:48.657 --> 09:50.831
"HE IS A BELGIAN."

09:50.866 --> 09:55.353
PRESIDENT MOBUTU HAD BUILT
A NEW RUNWAY FOR JUMBO JETS

09:55.387 --> 09:59.806
AND A FOUR-LANE HIGHWAY TO
CONNECT THE AIRPORT TO DOWNTOWN.

09:59.840 --> 10:04.189
TO RETROFIT THE CITY'S
DECREPIT 62,000-SEAT STADIUM,

10:04.224 --> 10:07.399
ONE HUNDRED TONS OF
REFRIGERATORS, STEAM TABLES,

10:07.434 --> 10:09.816
SHOWERHEADS,
AND BOXING EQUIPMENT

10:09.850 --> 10:12.991
HAD ARRIVED FROM BELGIUM.

10:13.026 --> 10:16.029
ALI AND HIS ENTOURAGE
WERE HOUSED

10:16.063 --> 10:18.169
AT ONE OF MOBUTU'S
PRESIDENTIAL COMPOUNDS

10:18.203 --> 10:23.139
25 MILES OUTSIDE OF THE CITY,
IN N'SELE.

10:23.174 --> 10:26.108
WE WAS STAYING AT
MOBUTU'S QUARTERS

10:26.142 --> 10:28.213
OUT ON THE CONGO RIVER.

10:28.248 --> 10:31.838
I MEAN, THAT WAS THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL SIGHT I EVER SEEN,

10:31.872 --> 10:34.737
BECAUSE THE RIVER,
YOU COULD SEE THE LILIES

10:34.772 --> 10:36.428
GOING DOWN THE RIVER,

10:36.463 --> 10:39.708
AND IN THE EVENING
THE SUN WOULD SET,

10:39.742 --> 10:42.262
AND YOU WOULD SEE
ALL OF THAT BEAUTIFUL COLOR

10:42.296 --> 10:45.265
IN THAT WATER,

10:45.299 --> 10:49.718
AND I SHOT SOME PICTURES OF
THAT SO I COULD KEEP IT.

10:52.065 --> 10:55.689
GEORGE FOREMAN
SEEMED ILL AT EASE IN AFRICA.

10:55.724 --> 10:58.174
HE HAD ARRIVED TO
FAR LESS FANFARE THAN ALI

10:58.209 --> 11:01.281
AND MOVED INTO THE VILLA
OF A ZAIRIAN OFFICIAL

11:01.315 --> 11:03.904
A FEW MILES DOWN THE ROAD
FROM HIS OPPONENT

11:03.939 --> 11:06.976
AND KEPT MOSTLY TO HIMSELF.

11:07.011 --> 11:11.429
ON SEPTEMBER 16th, FOREMAN'S
SPARRING PARTNER CAUGHT HIM

11:11.463 --> 11:15.329
WITH AN ELBOW, OPENING
A CUT ABOVE HIS RIGHT EYE.

11:15.364 --> 11:19.195
THOUGH IT REQUIRED NO STITCHES,
FOREMAN'S DOCTOR CONCLUDED

11:19.230 --> 11:21.508
THAT THE WOUND WOULD TAKE
WEEKS TO HEAL

11:21.542 --> 11:25.063
AND CALLED FOR THE FIGHT
TO BE POSTPONED.

11:25.098 --> 11:28.860
LOCAL OFFICIALS, WHO
HAD SPENT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

11:28.895 --> 11:31.794
ON PREPARATIONS AND WORRIED
THAT ANY DELAY

11:31.829 --> 11:34.038
COULD MEAN RISKING
THE TORRENTIAL DOWNPOURS

11:34.072 --> 11:36.488
AND FATAL FLOODS OF THE UPCOMING
RAINY SEASON,

11:36.523 --> 11:38.387
CLAIMED THAT FOREMAN'S CAMP

11:38.421 --> 11:41.424
WAS OVERSTATING
THE SEVERITY OF THE CUT.

11:41.459 --> 11:43.012
I WANT THE PRESIDENT

11:43.047 --> 11:44.358
TO PUT STRICT ORDERS
ON THE AIRPORT.

11:44.393 --> 11:46.015
DON'T LET GEORGE OUT
OF THIS COUNTRY.

11:48.431 --> 11:50.399
PLEASE DON'T LET HIM GO.

11:50.433 --> 11:52.815
I'M READY. I'M DANCING.

11:52.850 --> 11:55.956
GEORGE FOREMAN
WANTED TO GO HOME.

11:55.991 --> 11:59.822
AND I KNOW ALREADY--
AND I ALREADY SAID

11:59.857 --> 12:02.963
IN THE BACK OF HIS MIND
HE GOT ACCIDENTALLY CUT,

12:02.998 --> 12:05.552
BUT HE DON'T
WANT TO STAY IN AFRICA.

12:05.586 --> 12:07.243
I KNOW ONCE HE GOT BACK
IN AMERICA,

12:07.278 --> 12:08.900
HE WASN'T COMING BACK.

12:08.935 --> 12:10.764
IF HE GOT BACK TO AMERICA,
IT WAS OVER WITH.

12:10.799 --> 12:12.524
THAT FIGHT WAS DONE FOR.

12:12.559 --> 12:15.217
WHEN FOREMAN ASKED
TO GO TO FRANCE OR BELGIUM

12:15.251 --> 12:19.290
FOR A SECOND OPINION ON HIS CUT,
MOBUTU SAID NO.

12:19.324 --> 12:23.259
HE HAD REPORTEDLY CONFISCATED
FOREMAN'S PASSPORT.

12:23.294 --> 12:27.574
EVENTUALLY THE FIGHT WAS
RESCHEDULED FOR OCTOBER 30th

12:27.608 --> 12:31.440
AT 4 A.M. ZAIRE TIME.

12:31.474 --> 12:33.200
I'M GOING TO FLOAT
LIKE A BUTTERFLY

12:33.235 --> 12:34.892
AND STING LIKE A BEE.

12:34.926 --> 12:37.273
GEORGE CAN'T HIT
WHAT HIS EYES CAN'T SEE.

12:37.308 --> 12:39.586
NOW YOU SEE ME,
NOW YOU DON'T.

12:39.620 --> 12:41.830
YOU THINK YOU WILL,
BUT I KNOW YOU WON'T.

12:43.072 --> 12:45.592
GEORGE FOREMAN.

12:45.626 --> 12:47.939
BOMAYE.
BOMAYE...

12:47.974 --> 12:52.047
SEE, FOREMAN DIDN'T GO OUT.
FOREMAN STAYED IN HIS CAMP.

12:52.081 --> 12:55.050
AND I WOULD WATCH ALI
WALK THROUGH THE STREETS.

12:55.084 --> 12:58.122
PEOPLE TOUCHED HIM.
ALI WAS LOOSE.

12:58.156 --> 13:00.849
AND HE KNEW THEY LOVED HIM.

13:00.883 --> 13:03.196
ALL THOSE PEOPLE IN KINSHASA

13:03.230 --> 13:08.097
MADE A CHOICE FOR HIM
OVER FOREMAN.

13:08.132 --> 13:10.479
AND SO WHEN THAT FIGHT HIT,

13:10.513 --> 13:15.001
EVERYBODY--I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY
WANTED FOREMAN TO WIN.

13:15.035 --> 13:18.038
WHEN ALI
RAN IN THE COUNTRYSIDE

13:18.073 --> 13:22.111
AROUND MOBUTU'S COMPOUND,
CROWDS TURNED OUT TO CHEER HIM,

13:22.146 --> 13:26.184
CHANTING "ALI, BOMAYE,"
"ALI, KILL HIM."

13:26.219 --> 13:32.466
ALI, BOMAYE! ALI, BOMAYE!
ALI, BOMAYE...

13:35.504 --> 13:39.888
ONE DAY IN N'SELE,
ALI RAN INTO VERONICA PORCHE,

13:39.922 --> 13:43.408
AN 18-YEAR-OLD PRE-MED STUDENT
FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

13:43.443 --> 13:47.447
WHO HAD BEEN HIRED BY DON KING
TO HELP PROMOTE THE FIGHT.

13:47.481 --> 13:49.380
THEY HAD MET WEEKS EARLIER

13:49.414 --> 13:52.383
AT AN EXHIBITION MATCH IN
SALT LAKE CITY.

13:52.417 --> 13:55.420
AT FIRST, HE PAID
LITTLE ATTENTION TO HER,

13:55.455 --> 13:57.629
BUT AS SHE BOARDED THE BUS
BACK TO KINSHASA,

13:57.664 --> 14:00.046
HE OFFERED TO JOIN HER.

14:00.080 --> 14:01.564
THE TWO SPENT THE TRIP

14:01.599 --> 14:04.671
DISCUSSING THEIR CHILDHOODS
AND FAMILIES.

14:04.705 --> 14:06.431
IT MADE A GOOD IMPRESSION

14:06.466 --> 14:08.537
BECAUSE I SAID, "OH, HE'S
A NICE GUY. HE'S HUMBLE."

14:08.571 --> 14:11.885
HE'S NOT, YOU KNOW--
THAT PUBLIC PERSONA

14:11.920 --> 14:14.198
WAS NOT THERE.

14:14.232 --> 14:17.063
AND NOT THAT I DISLIKED
THE PUBLIC PERSONA,

14:17.097 --> 14:19.444
IT WAS MORE WHEN HE
WAS BRAGGING.

14:19.479 --> 14:21.895
ALI HOPED
TO SEE HER AGAIN.

14:21.930 --> 14:24.380
BELINDA HAD RETURNED
TO THE UNITED STATES

14:24.415 --> 14:26.624
WHEN THE FIGHT WAS POSTPONED.

14:26.658 --> 14:30.352
THE FIRST CONVERSATION
THAT WE HAD

14:30.386 --> 14:34.977
WHERE HE EXPRESSED INTEREST
IN SEEING ME AGAIN,

14:35.012 --> 14:38.153
I SAID, "WELL, YOU'RE MARRIED."

14:38.187 --> 14:41.018
AND HE TOLD ME
HE WAS GETTING DIVORCED.

14:41.052 --> 14:43.537
I ASKED ONE PERSON,
WHO TOLD ME,

14:43.572 --> 14:46.161
"YEAH, THEY'RE HAVING
A LOT OF PROBLEMS."

14:46.195 --> 14:49.647
AND ANOTHER PERSON SAID,
"WELL, THEY'RE BOTH MY FRIENDS,

14:49.681 --> 14:52.098
SO I DON'T WANT
TO SAY ANYTHING."

14:52.132 --> 14:54.445
I DID TRY TO FIND OUT IF--

14:54.479 --> 14:56.447
I DIDN'T JUST TAKE HIS WORD
FOR IT.

14:56.481 --> 14:58.967
BUT I BECAME CONVINCED THAT
HE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH,

14:59.001 --> 15:02.211
SO THAT'S WHY
I DID SEE HIM AGAIN.

15:02.246 --> 15:04.455
IN FACT,
ALI WAS SEEING

15:04.489 --> 15:07.320
AT LEAST TWO OTHER WOMEN
IN AFRICA.

15:07.354 --> 15:09.701
WHEN BELINDA RETURNED TO ZAIRE,

15:09.736 --> 15:12.118
SHE STAYED IN A HOTEL
IN KINSHASA.

15:12.152 --> 15:14.223
SHE AND ALI QUARRELED;

15:14.258 --> 15:17.675
HE ACCUSED HER OF HAVING SLEPT
WITH ANOTHER MAN.

15:17.709 --> 15:21.196
VERONICA REMAINED OUT OF SIGHT,

15:21.230 --> 15:25.234
QUIETLY VISITING ALI
AT HIS COMPOUND.

15:25.269 --> 15:29.169
SO WE WOULD WALK ALONG THE WATER
IN THE EVENINGS.

15:29.204 --> 15:30.964
IT WAS REALLY BEAUTIFUL,

15:30.999 --> 15:34.588
AND TALKED, AND HE GAVE ME
A LOT OF HIS LECTURES

15:34.623 --> 15:40.077
THAT I LATER FOUND OUT THAT HE
HAD TAKEN IDEAS

15:40.111 --> 15:42.665
FROM SUFI BOOKS
AND HAD WRITTEN THEM.

15:42.700 --> 15:46.083
BUT AT THE TIME, I THOUGHT HE
HAD WRITTEN IT ALL HIMSELF,

15:46.117 --> 15:48.154
AND TOPICS LIKE
LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP.

15:48.188 --> 15:50.018
AND IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL.

15:50.052 --> 15:54.091
I ACTUALLY FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM
LISTENING TO THOSE LECTURES.

15:55.644 --> 15:57.611
AS THE FIGHT APPROACHED,

15:57.646 --> 16:00.476
MORE THAN 600 JOURNALISTS
ARRIVED IN ZAIRE,

16:00.511 --> 16:03.652
INCLUDING GEORGE PLIMPTON,
HUNTER S. THOMPSON,

16:03.686 --> 16:05.654
AND NORMAN MAILER.

16:09.589 --> 16:12.074
TIME!

16:12.109 --> 16:14.387
I FIGHT
IN MANY EUROPEAN COUNTRIES,

16:14.421 --> 16:17.769
AND IT'S A GREATER FEELING
FIGHTING IN A BLACK COUNTRY.

16:17.804 --> 16:21.049
I FIGHT IN AFRICA BECAUSE
I'M FIGHTING IN MY HOMELAND.

16:25.536 --> 16:27.227
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

16:27.262 --> 16:29.022
AMERICA'S NOT
MY ORIGINAL HOMELAND.

16:29.057 --> 16:31.266
MY ORIGINAL
HOMELAND IS AFRICA.

16:31.300 --> 16:33.061
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

16:33.095 --> 16:36.029
THE WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION,
GEORGE FOREMAN.

16:36.064 --> 16:37.686
GEORGE FOREMAN,

16:37.720 --> 16:39.791
WHO HAD FINALLY RESUMED
FULL WORKOUTS,

16:39.826 --> 16:42.139
MADE LITTLE TIME FOR REPORTERS

16:42.173 --> 16:45.694
AND GAVE THEM
ALMOST NOTHING TO WRITE ABOUT.

16:45.728 --> 16:48.662
THOUGH HIS TRAINING SESSIONS
WERE WELL-ATTENDED,

16:48.697 --> 16:50.561
HE BARELY ACKNOWLEDGED
THE CROWD,

16:50.595 --> 16:52.356
PREFERRING TO PUT IN HIS WORK

16:52.390 --> 16:54.254
AND RETURN TO THE HOTEL
IN KINSHASA,

16:54.289 --> 16:56.118
WHERE HE WAS NOW STAYING.

16:56.153 --> 16:58.155
I'LL BRUISE UP
GEORGE FOREMAN.

16:58.189 --> 17:00.467
IF I DON'T KNOCK HIM OUT,
I'LL CUT HIM UP!

17:00.502 --> 17:03.470
ALL AROUND HIS FACE WILL
BE NICKS AND CUTS.

17:03.505 --> 17:05.783
I'M SO SHARP,
WHEN I'M FINISHED,

17:05.817 --> 17:08.544
IT'LL LOOK LIKE I HAD
A RAZOR BLADE.

17:08.579 --> 17:12.445
MOST PEOPLE
THOUGHT, TO BE TRUTHFUL,

17:12.479 --> 17:14.826
THAT FOREMAN
WOULD WIN THAT FIGHT,

17:14.861 --> 17:19.521
EVEN IF THEY LOVED ALI.

17:19.555 --> 17:23.387
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND, I MEAN,
FOREMAN WAS

17:23.421 --> 17:27.770
THIS OVERWHELMING,
BIG KNOCK-OUT ARTIST

17:27.805 --> 17:30.359
WHO JUST WHUPPED EVERYBODY,

17:30.394 --> 17:33.535
YOU KNOW, AND EVERYBODY
COULDN'T GET PAST THAT.

17:33.569 --> 17:35.709
AND, YOU KNOW, THEY JUST
THOUGHT THAT HE WAS

17:35.744 --> 17:38.367
GONNA DESTROY ALI.

17:38.402 --> 17:40.542
THE DAY BEFORE THE FIGHT--

17:40.576 --> 17:43.372
WHAT ALI HAD DUBBED
"THE RUMBLE IN THE JUNGLE,"

17:43.407 --> 17:46.548
HIS TRAINER, ANGELO DUNDEE,
HEADED TO THE STADIUM

17:46.582 --> 17:48.550
TO INSPECT THE RING,

17:48.584 --> 17:51.346
WHICH HAD BEEN BUILT BENEATH
A TEMPORARY TIN ROOF

17:51.380 --> 17:53.865
IN CASE THE HEAVY RAINS
FINALLY ARRIVED.

17:53.900 --> 17:56.489
HE DIDN'T LIKE WHAT HE SAW.

17:56.523 --> 17:59.630
THE CANVAS FLOOR WAS
SOFT AND SLANTED,

17:59.664 --> 18:02.771
AND THE ROPES SAGGED
FROM THE HEAT.

18:02.805 --> 18:05.291
THE TRAINER TIGHTENED THE ROPES
AND LEVELED THE FLOOR

18:05.325 --> 18:09.295
AS BEST HE COULD.

18:09.329 --> 18:12.194
AT 2 A.M. ON OCTOBER 30th,

18:12.229 --> 18:15.163
ALI BOARDED A BUS
TO THE STADIUM.

18:15.197 --> 18:18.545
THE MOOD IN HIS DRESSING ROOM
WAS GRIM.

18:18.580 --> 18:21.272
EVERYBODY BUT THE FIGHTER
WAS FEARFUL

18:21.307 --> 18:23.930
HE WOULD BE HURT OR WORSE.

18:23.964 --> 18:26.415
ALI WASN'T SCARED.

18:26.450 --> 18:29.315
ALI HAD NO FEAR.

18:29.349 --> 18:32.421
MY BIGGEST FEAR IS, SHOULD HE
GET HURT, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO

18:32.456 --> 18:34.458
FOR A HOSPITAL OVER HERE?

18:34.492 --> 18:37.875
YOU KNOW, THAT WAS
THE BIG FEAR FOR ME.

18:37.909 --> 18:39.601
BUT ALI HAD NO FEAR

18:39.635 --> 18:42.431
BECAUSE THE HONORABLE
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD TOLD HIM,

18:42.466 --> 18:45.538
"ALLAH IS IN YOUR CORNER.
HE DOESN'T HAVE ALLAH."

18:45.572 --> 18:48.575
AND THAT WAS ALI'S
BOOSTER ROCKET.

18:48.610 --> 18:50.957
FIVE MINUTES
BEFORE THE FIGHT,

18:50.991 --> 18:54.202
THE BOXER SQUEEZED INTO
A TOILET STALL WITH HIS MANAGER,

18:54.236 --> 18:58.620
HERBERT MUHAMMAD, AND READ
ALOUD FROM THE QUR'AN.

18:58.654 --> 19:01.761
IN GEORGE FOREMAN'S
DRESSING ROOM,

19:01.795 --> 19:03.866
THE CHAMP JOINED HANDS
WITH HIS CORNERMEN,

19:03.901 --> 19:07.836
INCLUDING ALI'S ONE-TIME TRAINER
ARCHIE MOORE.

19:07.870 --> 19:12.565
"I PRAYED THAT GEORGE WOULDN'T
KILL ALI," MOORE SAID LATER.

19:12.599 --> 19:16.431
THERE YOU SEE HIM,
PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE SEKO,

19:16.465 --> 19:18.467
THE MAN THAT ABSOLUTELY RUNS
THIS COUNTRY.

19:18.502 --> 19:20.262
AND WHAT A JOB HE HAS DONE.

19:20.297 --> 19:22.437
NEVER BEFORE
IN THE HISTORY OF BOXING

19:22.471 --> 19:23.955
AND PERHAPS IN ALL SPORTS
HAS THERE BEEN

19:23.990 --> 19:25.888
AN EVENT THAT PACKS THE DRAMA,

19:25.923 --> 19:27.649
THE TRUE EXCITEMENT,
THE SUSPENSE,

19:27.683 --> 19:30.376
AND ESPECIALLY THE MYSTIQUE
OF THIS SPECTACLE.

19:30.410 --> 19:33.482
THEY SAID IT COULDN'T HAPPEN
IN THE DEEPEST PART OF AFRICA,

19:33.517 --> 19:35.001
BUT HERE WE ARE.

19:35.035 --> 19:36.623
GEORGE FOREMAN
HAS THAT SERIOUS LOOK.

19:36.658 --> 19:38.280
ALI DEFINITELY TALKING TO HIM.

19:38.315 --> 19:39.971
LOOK AT THE STARE
ON GEORGE FOREMAN.

19:40.006 --> 19:41.835
LOOK AT ALI GIVE HIM THE WORD.

19:41.870 --> 19:44.942
SO THE STAGE IS SET, ROUND ONE.

19:44.976 --> 19:46.564
THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP

19:46.599 --> 19:48.290
OF THE WORLD AT STAKE.

19:48.325 --> 19:50.430
HERE WE GO.
ALI QUICKLY ACROSS...

19:50.465 --> 19:52.432
MUHAMMAD ALI STRUCK FIRST,

19:52.467 --> 19:53.847
SURPRISING ALMOST EVERYONE.

19:53.882 --> 19:55.677
...THE LIGHT RIGHT HAND

19:55.711 --> 19:57.886
TAKEN ON THE FOREHEAD BY
GEORGE FOREMAN, THE CHAMPION.

19:57.920 --> 20:00.371
THOUGH HE MADE FOREMAN
CHASE HIM INTO THE CORNERS

20:00.406 --> 20:04.617
AND ALONG THE ROPES DURING
ROUND ONE, HE DID NOT DANCE.

20:10.450 --> 20:13.557
FOREMAN LAUNCHED
PUNCH AFTER PUNCH,

20:13.591 --> 20:16.525
ASSUMING HE'D NEED TO LAND
JUST ONE TO END THE FIGHT.

20:16.560 --> 20:18.009
THE REFEREE SEPARATES THEM.

20:18.044 --> 20:20.598
ABOUT 8 SECONDS LEFT
IN THE ROUND, ROUND ONE.

20:20.633 --> 20:23.877
FOREMAN AND ALI ENDING
ROUND ONE.

20:25.914 --> 20:29.020
IN ALI'S CORNER
BEFORE ROUND TWO,

20:29.055 --> 20:31.506
HIS TEAM BEGGED HIM TO STAY
OFF THE ROPES

20:31.540 --> 20:33.853
AND AWAY FROM FOREMAN.

20:33.887 --> 20:35.993
HERE WE GO,
ROUND NUMBER TWO...

20:36.027 --> 20:37.581
ALI SHOCKED EVERYBODY
'CAUSE HE WOULDN'T TELL NOBODY

20:37.615 --> 20:39.617
WHAT HE WAS DOING,

20:39.652 --> 20:41.585
AND ANGELO DUNDEE AND ALL OF
THEM WAS PULLING THEIR HAIR OUT.

20:41.619 --> 20:43.966
FOREMAN TRIES
TO WORK THE BODY.

20:44.001 --> 20:46.624
NEITHER ONE OF THOSE PUNCHES
DID ANY DAMAGE.

20:46.659 --> 20:48.971
NONE OF THOSE PUNCHES
ARE DOING ANY DAMAGE AT ALL.

20:49.006 --> 20:50.973
NONE, ABSOLUTELY NONE.

20:51.008 --> 20:52.768
THERE'S THE LIGHT FLICKING
LEFT HAND

20:52.803 --> 20:54.770
TO THE FACE OF GEORGE FOREMAN.

20:54.805 --> 20:56.945
FOREMAN PUSHING
THE HEAD BACK OF ALI.

20:56.979 --> 20:59.810
WE WERE ABLE TO OBSERVE
A LITTLE BIT OF PUFFINESS

20:59.844 --> 21:01.915
UNDER THE LEFT EYE
OF GEORGE FOREMAN.

21:01.950 --> 21:04.021
THE LEFT EYE, NOT THE RIGHT EYE.

21:04.055 --> 21:06.506
OH, WHAT A COMBINATION
LANDED BY ALI

21:06.541 --> 21:07.852
TO THE FACE OF GEORGE FOREMAN.

21:07.887 --> 21:09.716
ROUND THREE JUST UNDERWAY...

21:09.751 --> 21:12.616
IN ROUND THREE,
ALI WENT BACK TO THE ROPES

21:12.650 --> 21:14.894
AND ALLOWED FOREMAN
TO SWING AWAY AT HIS BODY

21:14.928 --> 21:17.862
WHILE HE FIRED COMBINATIONS
AT THE CHAMP'S HEAD.

21:17.897 --> 21:20.796
LEFT HAND, LIGHT LEFT
TAKEN ON THE CHIN OF ALI.

21:20.831 --> 21:22.867
THAT WILD LEFT HAND
IS NOT SCORING.

21:22.902 --> 21:24.731
FOREMAN SETTING HIM UP
AGAINST THE ROPES.

21:24.766 --> 21:28.390
WHAT A VICIOUS,
FAST COMBINATION BY ALI.

21:28.425 --> 21:32.083
ALI DEFINITELY SHOWING
SOME HAND SPEED IN THIS FIGHT.

21:32.118 --> 21:36.674
THERE'S THE CHANT "ALI, BOMAYE."
THAT MEANS "ALI, KILL HIM."

21:36.709 --> 21:44.751
THE ROPE-A-DOPE IS A...TRAP THAT
MUHAMMAD EMPLOYED

21:44.786 --> 21:46.960
TO ENSNARL GEORGE FOREMAN.

21:46.995 --> 21:50.792
MUHAMMAD LAYS AGAINST THE ROPES,
INVITES GEORGE FOREMAN

21:50.826 --> 21:54.865
TO "POUND AWAY, BRUH.
NOT GONNA HIT MY HEAD,

21:54.899 --> 21:57.419
AND IF YOU DO,
LIKE, I CAN TAKE IT."

21:57.454 --> 21:58.903
AND IF YOU'RE MOVING AROUND
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RING,

21:58.938 --> 22:00.664
GUESS WHAT.

22:00.698 --> 22:03.943
YOU'RE USING UP
YOUR ENERGY FOR YOUR LEGS.

22:03.977 --> 22:08.430
SO IT'S SMARTER TO
LAY AGAINST THE ROPES.

22:08.465 --> 22:11.571
LOOK AT HIM WHISPERING
IN THE EAR OF FOREMAN.

22:11.606 --> 22:13.573
WHY HE CONTINUES TO TAUNT HIM.

22:13.608 --> 22:15.886
ALI SUPER CONFIDENT.

22:15.920 --> 22:18.095
ANGELO IS SCREAMING,
"GET OFF THE ROPES!

22:18.129 --> 22:20.925
STAY OFF THE ROPES.
STAY OFF THE ROPES!"

22:20.960 --> 22:23.514
AND AFTER ONE OF THE ROUNDS,
HE CAME AND HE SAT DOWN,

22:23.549 --> 22:25.827
AND HE SAID, "SHUT THE F UP."

22:25.861 --> 22:28.070
HE KNEW EXACTLY
WHAT HE WAS DOING.

22:28.105 --> 22:29.624
THE LEFT HAND
SCORES AGAIN.

22:29.658 --> 22:31.488
FOREMAN LOOKING FOR
THE OPPORTUNITY.

22:31.522 --> 22:33.455
LOOKS, HAS A TREMENDOUS
LOOK OF DETERMINATION.

22:33.490 --> 22:35.181
STAGGERED! FOREMAN STAGGERED...

22:35.215 --> 22:38.046
ALI LANDED SIX
STRAIGHT SHOTS TO FOREMAN'S HEAD

22:38.080 --> 22:41.498
EARLY IN THE FOURTH ROUND,
THEN SETTLED INTO THE ROPES

22:41.532 --> 22:44.846
AND COUNTERPUNCHED AS THE CHAMP
TRIED TO PUMMEL HIS BODY.

22:44.880 --> 22:46.606
ALI PICKS IT UP
A LITTLE BIT.

22:46.641 --> 22:50.645
ABOUT 40 SECONDS LEFT
IN ROUND NUMBER FIVE.

22:50.679 --> 22:53.199
GOOD CRISP LEFT,
A COMBINATION BY ALI

22:53.233 --> 22:55.857
LANDS ON THE HEAD OF FOREMAN.

22:55.891 --> 23:01.138
FOREMAN WITH THAT RIGHT HOOK.
ALI'S STARTING...

23:01.172 --> 23:04.486
WITH 30 SECONDS
REMAINING IN ROUND FIVE,

23:04.521 --> 23:07.800
ALI STAGGERED FOREMAN
WITH A SHARP RIGHT HAND,

23:07.834 --> 23:12.494
FOLLOWED BY A FLURRY OF
SHORT PUNCHES TO HIS HEAD.

23:12.529 --> 23:16.084
AND THE SHOTS
THAT LAND--ALI LANDS ON HIM,

23:16.118 --> 23:17.844
BEAUTIFUL SHOTS, MAN.

23:17.879 --> 23:20.088
THEY'RE NOT TEXTBOOK SHOTS.

23:20.122 --> 23:22.504
THEY'RE SHOTS THAT ONLY
MUHAMMAD ALI CAN THROW,

23:22.539 --> 23:24.610
ANGLE-WISE.

23:26.474 --> 23:28.786
BY THE SIXTH ROUND,
FOREMAN HAD SLOWED,

23:28.821 --> 23:31.548
HIS FACE PUFFY AND BRUISED.

23:31.582 --> 23:35.483
ALI IS USING
HIS MIND AS WELL AS HIS FIST.

23:35.517 --> 23:37.795
HOW DO YOU BEAT THIS GUY?

23:37.830 --> 23:40.246
...FOREMAN, THERE'S NO
ESCAPING ANY OF THOSE PUNCHES,

23:40.280 --> 23:41.972
AND YOU DON'T NEED ME
TO TELL YOU THAT.

23:42.006 --> 23:44.146
WELL,
YOU LET HIM PUNCH HIMSELF OUT.

23:44.181 --> 23:46.114
FOREMAN DEFINITELY
SHOWING SOME FATIGUE

23:46.148 --> 23:48.599
IN THE WANING SECONDS
IN ROUND SEVEN.

23:48.634 --> 23:52.500
AND ONCE HE GETS TIRED,
ALI FLIPS THE SWITCH.

23:54.191 --> 23:56.849
HERE WE GO. THE BELL
SOUNDS, ROUND NUMBER EIGHT.

23:56.883 --> 23:59.714
FOREMAN LOOKING TO DELIVER
THE REAL HEAVY BLOWS.

23:59.748 --> 24:01.129
NOW HE'S POUNCING THERE.

24:01.163 --> 24:04.132
ALMOST FALLS OUT OF THE RING!

24:04.166 --> 24:06.237
THIRTY SECONDS LEFT
IN ROUND EIGHT.

24:06.272 --> 24:08.999
ALI, A SNEAKY RIGHT HAND.

24:09.033 --> 24:11.035
ANOTHER
SNEAKY RIGHT HAND.

24:11.070 --> 24:13.659
THIS TIME, HE'S WORKING
OVER THE SHOULDER OF FOREMAN.

24:13.693 --> 24:14.970
IT'S A COMBINATION!

24:19.596 --> 24:22.668
...3, 4, 5...

24:30.676 --> 24:33.092
MUHAMMAD ALI HAS DONE IT!

24:33.126 --> 24:34.921
THE GREAT MAN
HAS DONE IT!

24:34.956 --> 24:38.580
THIS IS THE MOST JOYOUS
SCENE EVER SEEN

24:38.615 --> 24:40.306
IN THE HISTORY OF BOXING!

24:40.340 --> 24:44.897
THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE SCENE.
THE PLACE IS GOING WILD...

24:44.931 --> 24:48.694
MORE THAN SEVEN YEARS
AFTER HE WAS EXILED FROM BOXING

24:48.728 --> 24:51.731
AND STRIPPED OF HIS CROWN,
MUHAMMAD ALI WAS

24:51.766 --> 24:55.321
ONCE AGAIN THE HEAVYWEIGHT
CHAMPION OF THE WORLD.

24:55.355 --> 24:58.151
IT'S AN AMAZING THING
TO WATCH.

24:58.186 --> 25:01.948
AND THIS GUY
WHO TOLD US BACK IN 1964

25:01.983 --> 25:03.674
THAT HE SHOOK UP THE WORLD,

25:03.709 --> 25:08.265
THIS IS 10 YEARS LATER,
HE'S GONE THROUGH EXILE,

25:08.299 --> 25:10.716
HE'S, YOU KNOW,
HAD HIS TITLE--EVERYTHING.

25:10.750 --> 25:12.234
HE'S COME BACK.

25:12.269 --> 25:14.271
THE COMEBACK'S BEEN GOOD,
BUT IT'S NOT BEEN GREAT.

25:14.305 --> 25:16.238
NOW HE'S FIGHTING SOMEBODY
HE'S NOT SUPPOSED

25:16.273 --> 25:19.069
TO BE ABLE TO BEAT, AND HE BEATS
HIM IN THIS DRAMATIC FASHION

25:19.103 --> 25:22.072
IN THIS SYMBOLIC LOCATION.

25:22.106 --> 25:27.111
IT'S THE FULL CIRCLE
OF HIS CAREER AS A BOXER.

25:27.146 --> 25:30.287
NOW HE'S BACK ON TOP.

25:30.321 --> 25:31.840
CONGRATULATIONS.

25:31.875 --> 25:33.359
AM I THE GREATEST
OF ALL TIME?

25:33.393 --> 25:35.810
MUHAMMAD, YOU TOLD
ME IN DEER LAKE YOU WERE

25:35.844 --> 25:37.674
THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME,
AND I THINK...

25:37.708 --> 25:40.331
ALI IS THE ONE WHO GETS
TO BE MADE WHOLE.

25:40.366 --> 25:42.161
HE HAS TO BE MADE WHOLE.

25:42.195 --> 25:44.750
THE REASON WHY WE LOVE HIM
IS BECAUSE HE'S THE ONE

25:44.784 --> 25:47.373
WHO ACTUALLY GOT IT ALL BACK.

25:47.407 --> 25:49.133
IF HE DOESN'T WIN THAT FIGHT,

25:49.168 --> 25:50.721
IF HE DOESN'T COME
ALL THE WAY BACK,

25:50.756 --> 25:53.621
HE GETS BROKEN
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

25:53.655 --> 25:56.934
HE GOT TO BE BEAUTIFUL.
HE GOT TO BE FULL FLOWER.

25:56.969 --> 26:00.697
HE GOT TO USE THE FULL TALENT,
SO YOU COULD SEE ALL THE GIFTS.

26:00.731 --> 26:03.216
AND THAT'S WHY
WE LOVE HIM SO MUCH.

26:03.251 --> 26:05.771
PEOPLE EVERYWHERE
CHEERED

26:05.805 --> 26:08.670
ALI'S UNEXPECTED TRIUMPH.

26:08.705 --> 26:11.708
"IT'S A VICTORY OF ALL THE
OPPRESSED IN THE THIRD WORLD,"

26:11.742 --> 26:13.364
WROTE A SENEGALESE JOURNALIST.

26:13.399 --> 26:16.057
"THE WHOLE OF AFRICA HAS
UNITED ITSELF

26:16.091 --> 26:18.300
"BEHIND MUHAMMAD ALI...

26:18.335 --> 26:21.959
THE BELOVED ONE
ON OUR CONTINENT."

26:21.994 --> 26:26.757
I THINK THAT
WHAT IT DID FOR AMERICA,

26:26.792 --> 26:31.382
IT MADE AFRICA REAL FOR
A LOT OF PEOPLE WHERE IT WASN'T.

26:31.417 --> 26:36.629
THIS IS A PLACE, AND IN THIS
PLACE, A GREAT THING HAPPENED.

26:36.664 --> 26:40.771
BACK IN LOUISVILLE,
ALI JOINED JOE MARTIN

26:40.806 --> 26:43.153
AND FRED STONER--
HIS FIRST TRAINERS--

26:43.187 --> 26:46.121
AND AN OVERFLOW CROWD AT
RIVERFRONT PLAZA

26:46.156 --> 26:49.193
AS THE CITY CELEBRATED
MUHAMMAD ALI DAY

26:49.228 --> 26:53.059
AND RENAMED A DOWNTOWN STREET
IN HIS HONOR.

26:53.094 --> 26:55.855
IN CHICAGO, MAYOR RICHARD DALEY,

26:55.890 --> 26:59.825
WHO, IN 1966, HAD RESCINDED
ALI'S BOXING LICENSE,

26:59.859 --> 27:03.242
AWARDED HIM THE CITY'S
MEDAL OF MERIT.

27:03.276 --> 27:06.866
PRESIDENT GERALD FORD SEEKING,
HE SAID,

27:06.901 --> 27:09.110
TO "HEAL THE WOUNDS OF
RACIAL DIVISION,

27:09.144 --> 27:10.905
VIETNAM, AND WATERGATE,"

27:10.939 --> 27:13.873
INVITED THE BOXER
TO THE OVAL OFFICE.

27:13.908 --> 27:18.671
MUHAMMAD ALI, FORD SAID, "WAS
A MAN OF PRINCIPLE."

27:18.706 --> 27:23.987
MUHAMMAD ALI WAS THE MOST
IMPORTANT MAN IN THE WORLD.

27:24.021 --> 27:27.680
EVERYBODY KNEW HIM. EVERYBODY.

27:27.715 --> 27:32.478
YOU KNOW? IT WAS A GREATNESS
THAT NOBODY HAD.

27:32.512 --> 27:34.342
AND THERE WERE NO DOORS
CLOSED TO HIM.

27:41.729 --> 27:46.112
IN THE FALL OF 1974,
ALI AND BELINDA SOLD THEIR HOME

27:46.147 --> 27:48.114
IN NEW JERSEY
AND BOUGHT A TUDOR MANSION ON

27:48.149 --> 27:50.116
CHICAGO'S SOUTH SIDE,

27:50.151 --> 27:54.396
DOWN THE STREET FROM THE HOME
OF THE AILING ELIJAH MUHAMMAD.

27:54.431 --> 27:58.193
ALI HAD ALSO PURCHASED
A CONDOMINIUM IN CHICAGO

27:58.228 --> 28:00.713
FOR VERONICA,
WHOM HE HAD SECRETLY MARRIED

28:00.748 --> 28:05.028
IN A SMALL ISLAMIC CEREMONY
BEFORE THEY LEFT ZAIRE.

28:05.062 --> 28:08.928
BELINDA, WHO WOULD SOON CHANGE
HER FIRST NAME TO KHALILAH,

28:08.963 --> 28:10.896
KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT.

28:10.930 --> 28:13.761
AND VERONICA STILL BELIEVED
THAT ALI

28:13.795 --> 28:16.211
INTENDED TO DIVORCE HIS WIFE.

28:16.246 --> 28:20.940
I WAS NOT SAVVY
AND NOT EXPERIENCED.

28:20.975 --> 28:22.528
ALL I KNEW IS I LOVED HIM,

28:22.562 --> 28:25.876
AND I THOUGHT THAT'S THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING,

28:25.911 --> 28:28.948
AND THAT'S WHAT ALL THE SONGS
OF THAT ERA SAID.

28:28.983 --> 28:30.881
SO, THAT WAS

28:30.916 --> 28:33.435
MY EDUCATION
ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS.

28:35.506 --> 28:38.475
ON FEBRUARY 25, 1975,

28:38.509 --> 28:41.478
ALI WAS AT DEER LAKE
WHEN WORD CAME

28:41.512 --> 28:44.274
THAT ELIJAH MUHAMMAD HAD DIED.

28:44.308 --> 28:46.897
ALI IMMEDIATELY
RETURNED TO CHICAGO.

28:46.932 --> 28:49.313
THOUGH HE WAS STILL
OFFICIALLY SUSPENDED

28:49.348 --> 28:51.039
FROM THE NATION OF ISLAM,

28:51.074 --> 28:54.077
HE HAD CONTINUED TO VISIT
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD REGULARLY

28:54.111 --> 28:55.941
AND PRAISE HIM PUBLICLY,

28:55.975 --> 28:59.392
AND REMAINED AMONG
THE SECT'S LARGEST DONORS.

28:59.427 --> 29:03.362
THE LEADER'S FAMILY AND CLOSEST
ADVISORS CLOSED RANKS

29:03.396 --> 29:06.537
AROUND WALLACE MUHAMMAD,
HERBERT'S YOUNGER BROTHER,

29:06.572 --> 29:08.919
AS ELIJAH'S SUCCESSOR.

29:08.954 --> 29:11.784
AFTER EMBRACING
TRADITIONAL ISLAM YEARS EARLIER,

29:11.819 --> 29:15.098
WALLACE HAD FREQUENTLY REBELLED
AGAINST HIS FATHER'S TEACHINGS

29:15.132 --> 29:17.238
AND HAD BEEN CAST OUT
OF THE SECT

29:17.272 --> 29:18.929
FOR CHALLENGING ELIJAH'S CLAIM

29:18.964 --> 29:21.173
THAT HE WAS
THE MESSENGER OF ALLAH.

29:21.207 --> 29:25.142
BUT HE HAD RECENTLY
BEEN REINSTATED.

29:25.177 --> 29:27.248
BROTHER HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION
MUHAMMAD ALI.

29:29.181 --> 29:33.254
A DAY LATER, ALI
SWORE HIS ALLEGIANCE TO WALLACE.

29:33.288 --> 29:38.086
BROTHER WALLACE IS
NOW IN THE POSITION

29:38.121 --> 29:39.950
OF THE HONORABLE
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD.

29:39.985 --> 29:43.195
AND WHEN WE LOOK AT HIM,
YOU ARE LOOKING AT

29:43.229 --> 29:45.266
THE HONORABLE ELIJAH MUHAMMAD.

29:47.371 --> 29:52.549
MUHAMMAD DID NOT
HESITATE TO GO WITH WALLACE.

29:52.583 --> 29:56.104
HE, ACTUALLY, IN HIS HEART,
FOLLOWED

29:56.139 --> 29:59.349
THE TEACHINGS OF
WALLACE MUHAMMAD MORE CLOSELY

29:59.383 --> 30:01.834
THAN THOSE OF ELIJAH MUHAMMAD
ANYWAY

30:01.869 --> 30:05.148
BECAUSE HE LOVED ALL PEOPLE.

30:05.182 --> 30:08.427
I THINK WALLACE MUHAMMAD
WAS TEACHING THE THINGS

30:08.461 --> 30:12.258
THAT MALCOLM X HAD GONE OVER
TO SAUDI ARABIA

30:12.293 --> 30:14.157
AND DISCOVERED ON HIS OWN.

30:14.191 --> 30:16.987
OVER THE NEXT 18 MONTHS,

30:17.022 --> 30:18.644
WALLACE STEERED THE ORGANIZATION
TOWARD

30:18.678 --> 30:21.371
A MORE MAINSTREAM
INTERPRETATION OF ISLAM.

30:21.405 --> 30:25.927
HE DISBANDED THE FRUIT OF ISLAM,
THE ORGANIZATION'S ENFORCERS,

30:25.962 --> 30:29.068
DECLARED THAT DEVILS
COULD NOT BE IDENTIFIED

30:29.103 --> 30:32.865
BY PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES,
EFFECTIVELY OPENING MEMBERSHIP

30:32.900 --> 30:35.661
TO WHITE PEOPLE,
AND HE CHANGED THE GROUP'S NAME

30:35.695 --> 30:40.148
TO THE WORLD COMMUNITY
OF ISLAM IN THE WEST.

30:40.183 --> 30:43.427
WALLACE HAD A MUCH
MORE OPEN IDEA OF ISLAM,

30:43.462 --> 30:46.499
MUCH MORE IN
ACCORD WITH ORTHODOX ISLAM.

30:46.534 --> 30:48.467
THAT ENABLED MUHAMMAD ALI

30:48.501 --> 30:51.573
TO OPEN HIS EMBRACE
TO MORE PEOPLE.

30:51.608 --> 30:54.335
AND IT ALLOWED HIM
TO BE MORE UNIVERSAL

30:54.369 --> 30:56.268
IN HIS EXPRESSION OF ISLAM.

30:56.302 --> 30:58.270
AND IT WAS A VERY
GOOD THING FOR HIM.

31:05.449 --> 31:08.383
IN THE SPRING OF 1975,

31:08.418 --> 31:11.662
ALI EARNED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
FIGHTING AND DEFEATING

31:11.697 --> 31:14.010
LOWER-

31:14.044 --> 31:16.460
CHUCK WEPNER, RON LYLE,

31:16.495 --> 31:18.669
AND JOE BUGNER.

31:18.704 --> 31:23.191
BOTH VERONICA
AND BELINDA--NOW KHALILAH--

31:23.226 --> 31:25.918
OFTEN TRAVELED WITH HIM.

31:25.953 --> 31:29.232
AT FIRST, THE PRESS IDENTIFIED
VERONICA

31:29.266 --> 31:32.235
AS THE FAMILY'S BABYSITTER
OR KHALILAH'S COUSIN,

31:32.269 --> 31:34.927
BUT RUMORS BEGAN TO CIRCULATE.

31:34.962 --> 31:39.035
A "HAREM ATMOSPHERE PREVAILED"
AROUND ALI, WROTE ONE REPORTER,

31:39.069 --> 31:42.348
WHO NOTED THAT KHALILAH
HAD BEGUN INTRODUCING VERONICA

31:42.383 --> 31:45.248
AS "ALI'S OTHER WIFE."

31:45.282 --> 31:48.113
KHALILAH HAD GROWN TO ACCEPT
HER HUSBAND'S CHEATING,

31:48.147 --> 31:50.667
AT TIMES EVEN FACILITATING
HIS LIAISONS,

31:50.701 --> 31:54.982
AND SHE OCCASIONALLY
BEFRIENDED HER RIVALS.

31:55.016 --> 31:58.399
ALI HAD FATHERED CHILDREN
WITH AT LEAST TWO OTHER WOMEN

31:58.433 --> 32:01.022
DURING THEIR MARRIAGE,
BUT THROUGH IT ALL,

32:01.057 --> 32:03.024
KHALILAH STAYED WITH HIM.

32:03.059 --> 32:04.439
I HAD TO BE
HIS WIFE,

32:04.474 --> 32:07.028
AND THEN I HAD TO BE
HIS FRIEND, TOO.

32:07.063 --> 32:09.720
WHEN HE HAD A PROBLEM
WITH A PATERNITY SUIT

32:09.755 --> 32:12.378
OR SOME CHICK JUST TRYING
TO MILK HIM FOR MONEY,

32:12.413 --> 32:15.623
HE HAD TO COME TO ME
AND TELL ME ABOUT IT.

32:15.657 --> 32:19.178
"AND THEY SAID THIS IS MY KID."

32:19.213 --> 32:22.181
I HAD TO NOT BE A WIFE
AND BE HIS FRIEND AND SAYS,

32:22.216 --> 32:24.149
"LET ME LOOK AT THE KID.
I'LL SEE IF IT'S YOURS."

32:24.183 --> 32:27.014
WHEN IT BECAME
CLEAR THAT ALI'S RELATIONSHIP

32:27.048 --> 32:29.775
WITH VERONICA HAD DEVELOPED
INTO SOMETHING MORE,

32:29.809 --> 32:32.329
KHALILAH AGREED TO PUT UP
WITH HER PRESENCE

32:32.364 --> 32:35.781
IF IT MEANT AVOIDING A DIVORCE.

32:35.815 --> 32:39.026
IT GETS VERY COMPLICATED.

32:39.060 --> 32:44.376
ONE OF THE FACTORS WAS THAT
HIS MANAGER, HERBERT MUHAMMAD,

32:44.410 --> 32:49.174
DID NOT WANT HIM TO DIVORCE HER
BECAUSE SHE WAS A MUSLIM.

32:49.208 --> 32:52.073
THAT'S ENOUGH. THAT'S ENOUGH...

32:52.108 --> 32:56.457
- ON JULY 1, 1975,

32:56.491 --> 32:58.459
A TIE-BREAKING THIRD SHOWDOWN

32:58.493 --> 33:01.427
WITH HIS OLD NEMESIS
JOE FRAZIER.

33:01.462 --> 33:05.293
THE FIGHT WOULD BE HELD IN
OCTOBER IN THE PHILIPPINES

33:05.328 --> 33:09.780
AND WOULD COME TO BE KNOWN
AS "THE THRILLA IN MANILA."

33:09.815 --> 33:13.405
BY THIS POINT, YOU WOULD HAVE
THOUGHT THAT THEY

33:13.439 --> 33:15.545
HAD EARNED EACH OTHER'S RESPECT.

33:15.579 --> 33:18.651
NEITHER ONE REALLY HAD NEARLY
AS MUCH TO PROVE ANYMORE.

33:18.686 --> 33:21.723
ALI WAS WHOLE AGAIN.
FRAZIER WAS ON THE DOWNSIDE.

33:21.758 --> 33:25.658
THAT THERE WOULD'VE BEEN
SOME MOMENT THERE

33:25.693 --> 33:31.043
WHERE YOU COULD HAVE SAID
FINALLY, "RESPECT."

33:31.078 --> 33:37.463
NO, NO, NO RESPECT.

33:37.498 --> 33:40.501
THAT THIS IS, THIS CHAPTER IS
NOT FINISHED,

33:40.535 --> 33:42.710
THAT THIS BATTLE
IS NOT FINISHED.

33:42.744 --> 33:44.677
FERDINAND MARCOS,

33:44.712 --> 33:47.542
THE CORRUPT AND AUTHORITARIAN
DICTATOR OF THE PHILIPPINES,

33:47.577 --> 33:49.579
HOPED TO IMPROVE HIS REPUTATION

33:49.613 --> 33:52.754
AND PUT HIS COUNTRY IN THE
SPOTLIGHT BY HOSTING THE BOUT,

33:52.789 --> 33:56.172
JUST AS MOBUTU HAD IN ZAIRE.

33:56.206 --> 33:58.381
MR. PRESIDENT,
WHAT DO YOU THINK

33:58.415 --> 34:00.693
THIS SORT OF FIGHT WILL DO
FOR THE PHILIPPINES?

34:00.728 --> 34:02.695
WELL, IT DOES
PUBLICIZE THE PHILIPPINES,

34:02.730 --> 34:06.251
INCLUDING THE FACT THAT
THE GOVERNMENT IS STABLE

34:06.285 --> 34:09.185
AND THAT WE HAVE
PEACE AND ORDER.

34:09.219 --> 34:12.360
WHEN MARCOS
AND HIS WIFE IMELDA INVITED

34:12.395 --> 34:14.845
THE FIGHTERS TO
THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE,

34:14.880 --> 34:18.573
ALI BROUGHT VERONICA,
NOT KHALILAH.

34:18.608 --> 34:19.816
THAT'S ALL YOU'RE
GONNA SEE ME DO

34:19.850 --> 34:21.611
TO JOE FRAZIER'S HEAD
ALL NIGHT.

34:21.645 --> 34:22.784
I'M GONNA STOP
ALL THESE PEOPLE

34:22.819 --> 34:24.648
TALKING ABOUT JOE FRAZIER.

34:24.683 --> 34:26.823
THEY STILL THINK
JOE FRAZIER CAN WHUP ME.

34:26.857 --> 34:29.481
I'M GONNA SHOW 'EM. YOU SEE
HOW HE'S BOUNCING, HMM?

34:29.515 --> 34:31.241
SEE HIS HEAD?

34:31.276 --> 34:33.554
ALI INSULTED
FRAZIER'S INTELLIGENCE,

34:33.588 --> 34:35.832
CLAIMED HE SMELLED BAD,

34:35.866 --> 34:38.421
AND SNUCK INTO ONE OF FRAZIER'S
TRAINING SESSIONS

34:38.455 --> 34:41.803
TO HARASS HIM FROM THE CATWALK
ABOVE THE RING.

34:41.838 --> 34:46.187
BY MY MEASURE, THE TWO
WORST EPISODES OF ALI'S LIFE

34:46.222 --> 34:48.810
WERE HIS CASTING ASIDE
OF MALCOLM X

34:48.845 --> 34:52.262
AND HIS TREATMENT OF FRAZIER
GOING INTO THE THIRD FIGHT,

34:52.297 --> 34:53.884
THE THRILLA IN MANILA.

34:53.919 --> 34:59.269
GOTTA HOLD THE GORILLA.

34:59.304 --> 35:01.547
GOTTA CAPTURE THE GORILLA.

35:01.582 --> 35:05.551
THIRD FIGHT, THEY
BOTH WERE KIND OF OVER THE HILL.

35:05.586 --> 35:08.658
IT WAS GOING TO BE A WAR,
AND ALI KNEW THAT.

35:08.692 --> 35:11.764
HE KNEW THAT THE TIME
WAS RUNNING OUT ON HIM.

35:11.799 --> 35:16.390
SO, IT WAS A CRUEL, INSENSITIVE,
VILE EPISODE,

35:16.424 --> 35:18.909
AND FRAZIER NEVER FORGAVE HIM.

35:18.944 --> 35:22.672
FRAZIER HOPED TO
SURPRISE ALI WITH A NEW WEAPON.

35:22.706 --> 35:25.571
HE HAD BEEN WORKING
ON HIS RIGHT CROSS.

35:25.606 --> 35:28.298
"WHATEVER HAPPENS," FRAZIER
TOLD HIS TRAINER, EDDIE FUTCH,

35:28.333 --> 35:30.231
"DON'T STOP THE FIGHT.

35:30.266 --> 35:32.854
"I'M GONNA EAT THIS HALF-BREED'S
HEART RIGHT OUT OF HIS CHEST.

35:32.889 --> 35:37.169
THIS IS THE END OF HIM OR ME."

35:37.204 --> 35:40.793
ALI SKIPPED ROADWORK
AND SPARRING SESSIONS.

35:40.828 --> 35:43.831
"I'M ALREADY IN PERFECT SHAPE,"
HE CLAIMED.

35:43.865 --> 35:47.352
"I'LL BE SO MUCH SUPERIOR,
I'LL KNOCK HIM OUT."

35:47.386 --> 35:51.770
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

35:51.804 --> 35:55.360
THE GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE OF
THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES,

35:55.394 --> 36:01.504
IN COOPERATION WITH DON KING
PRODUCTIONS, INCORPORATED,

36:01.538 --> 36:07.510
PROUDLY PRESENT
THE THRILLA IN MANILA.

36:09.443 --> 36:12.239
WHAT YOU HAVE HERE
IS TWO EXTRAORDINARY HEARTS.

36:12.273 --> 36:15.242
IT'S NOT STYLES. IT'S HEARTS.

36:15.276 --> 36:17.727
INTRODUCING THE CHALLENGER

36:17.761 --> 36:23.733
AND FORMER HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION
OF THE WORLD, JOE FRAZIER.

36:23.767 --> 36:25.631
FRAZIER!

36:25.666 --> 36:28.841
FRAZIER SAYS,
"I'M GONNA WIN."

36:28.876 --> 36:31.637
AND EVERYTHING, HIS WHOLE HEART,
HIS WHOLE SOUL,

36:31.672 --> 36:33.363
EVERYTHING IS HIM WINNING.

36:33.398 --> 36:36.297
IN THE RED CORNER,

36:36.332 --> 36:41.647
WEIGHING 224 1/2 POUNDS...

36:41.682 --> 36:46.411
THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION
OF THE WORLD, MUHAMMAD ALI.

36:46.445 --> 36:48.309
ALI!

36:48.344 --> 36:51.692
SO JOE IS NOT INTIMIDATED,
AND ALI'S NEVER INTIMIDATED.

36:51.726 --> 36:53.314
IN THE RING THEY GO.

36:55.489 --> 36:56.973
THE ACTION

36:57.007 --> 36:59.424
BEGINS.

36:59.458 --> 37:02.323
ALI SCORING QUICKLY
WITH A COUPLE OF LEFTS.

37:04.325 --> 37:07.501
THE TWO MOST FAMILIAR
FIGHTERS IN THE WORLD

37:07.535 --> 37:09.710
MEETING FOR THE THIRD TIME.

37:11.090 --> 37:15.647
I THINK ALI WILL FIND FRAZIER
A DIFFERENT CUSTOMER

37:15.681 --> 37:18.581
IN TERMS OF ANY ROPE-A-DOPE
TACTICS.

37:18.615 --> 37:21.825
BY DEFINITION,
GEORGE FOREMAN WAS A SLUGGER.

37:21.860 --> 37:25.622
JOE FRAZIER,
HE KNOWS ABOUT PACING HIMSELF,

37:25.657 --> 37:28.315
WHEN TO, LIKE, YOU KNOW,
STEP BACK AND TAKE A BREATH,

37:28.349 --> 37:30.455
WHEN NOT TO PUNCH,

37:30.489 --> 37:33.458
WHEN TO TIE UP BECAUSE WHEN
YOU'RE TIED UP WITH SOMEONE,

37:33.492 --> 37:36.012
NOT ONLY IS HE RESTING,
BUT YOU'RE RESTING.

37:37.738 --> 37:41.535
ROUND TWO
JUST GETTING UNDERWAY.

37:41.569 --> 37:45.815
OH! A GOOD RIGHT LEAD
SNAPPED FRAZIER'S HEAD BACK.

37:45.849 --> 37:48.611
AGAIN, THAT RIGHT LEAD.

37:48.645 --> 37:51.579
A KEY TO THE FIGHT THUS FAR.

37:53.374 --> 37:57.309
ALI IS NOW SCORING
AGAINST JOE FRAZIER.

37:57.344 --> 37:58.862
BY THREE ROUNDS,

37:58.897 --> 38:01.106
IT LOOKS LIKE JOE'S GONNA GET
KNOCKED DOWN.

38:01.140 --> 38:03.971
WE'VE GOT
LESS THAN 30 SECONDS LEFT,

38:04.005 --> 38:06.732
AND ALI IS CLEANING UP
ON FRAZIER'S HEAD HERE

38:06.767 --> 38:09.114
IN THE LATE GOING.

38:09.148 --> 38:10.874
SUDDENLY, FOURTH ROUND,

38:10.909 --> 38:13.670
FRAZIER HITS ALI
WITH A RIGHT HAND.

38:13.705 --> 38:17.433
ALI SAYS TO HIM, "OLD MAN,
YOU AIN'T GOT NO RIGHT HAND.

38:17.467 --> 38:19.124
YOU AIN'T GOT
NO RIGHT HAND."

38:19.158 --> 38:22.541
BUT IT SLOWED ALI DOWN BECAUSE
HE HAD TO CHANGE HIS STRATEGY.

38:22.576 --> 38:24.923
NOW, ALL OF A SUDDEN,
FRAZIER'S WINNING THE FIGHT.

38:26.959 --> 38:31.412
FRAZIER ALWAYS ON TOP OF
ALI, TRYING TO GET THROUGH,

38:31.447 --> 38:33.759
ALWAYS THE AGGRESSOR.

38:33.794 --> 38:35.830
GOOD LEFT HOOK BY JOE FRAZIER.

38:35.865 --> 38:37.660
QUICKLY, ALI COVERS UP...

38:37.694 --> 38:39.593
IN THE SIXTH,

38:39.627 --> 38:43.010
FRAZIER LANDED TWO VICIOUS
LEFT HOOKS, STAGGERING ALI.

38:43.044 --> 38:45.978
OH, ANOTHER GOOD LEFT
BY JOE FRAZIER.

38:46.013 --> 38:50.638
QUICKLY, JOE CHANGES
THE NATURE OF THIS FIGHT...

38:50.673 --> 38:53.952
"GET OFF THE ROPES,"
DUNDEE SHOUTED AT ALI.

38:53.986 --> 38:55.988
JOE IS ALL OVER HIM
THIS ROUND,

38:56.023 --> 38:58.888
AND THOSE BLOWS HURT.

38:58.922 --> 39:01.511
GOOD LEFT TO THE MIDSECTION,
A RIGHT TO THE CHEST,

39:01.546 --> 39:05.481
ANOTHER LEFT HOOK
TO THE RIGHT JAW OF ALI.

39:05.515 --> 39:08.967
- EARLY IN THE SEVENTH,
ALI WHISPERED IN FRAZIER'-

39:09.001 --> 39:13.109
"OLD JOE FRAZIER, THEY TOLD ME
YOU WERE WASHED UP."

39:13.143 --> 39:17.458
"THEY LIED, PRETTY BOY,"
RESPONDED FRAZIER.

39:17.493 --> 39:19.874
ALI ON HIS TOES STILL,

39:19.909 --> 39:24.534
TRYING TO CREATE A MOVING TARGET
FOR FRAZIER.

39:24.569 --> 39:27.434
OH, GOOD BLOWS BY ALI.

39:27.468 --> 39:31.403
A COUPLE OF QUICK FLICKING
LEFTS, FOLLOWED BY A RIGHT.

39:31.438 --> 39:34.095
GOOD LEFT HOOK THERE BY FRAZIER.

39:34.130 --> 39:36.995
LESS THAN A MINUTE TO GO
IN THIS, THE TENTH ROUND,

39:37.029 --> 39:40.757
AND ALI SEEMS A WEARY FIGHTER.

39:40.792 --> 39:45.106
AT THIS POINT IN A FIGHT,
THE KEY QUESTIONS BECOME

39:45.141 --> 39:48.144
STAMINA AND STRENGTH.

39:48.178 --> 39:50.698
GOOD RIGHT THERE BY ALI.

39:50.733 --> 39:54.461
JOE TAKES TOO MANY
TO THE HEAD AS HE DID THERE.

39:54.495 --> 39:59.051
THAT'S WHY HIS EYES ARE
SO SUSCEPTIBLE TO DAMAGE.

39:59.086 --> 40:01.019
THOUGH BOTH MEN
WERE EXHAUSTED,

40:01.053 --> 40:03.539
IN THE 12th, ALI TOOK CHARGE,

40:03.573 --> 40:05.782
NEARLY CLOSING
FRAZIER'S LEFT EYE

40:05.817 --> 40:08.889
AND DRAWING A TRICKLE OF BLOOD
FROM HIS MOUTH.

40:11.754 --> 40:15.654
FRAZIER WAS BLIND
IN ONE EYE ALREADY.

40:15.689 --> 40:17.967
ALI CLOSED THE OTHER EYE
DURING THE FIGHT.

40:18.001 --> 40:20.452
BUT FRAZIER WANTS TO GO.

40:20.487 --> 40:22.903
THE GUY WANTS TO
GET IN THE RING AND FIGHT BLIND.

40:22.937 --> 40:27.977
IN THE OTHER CORNER, ALI
IS EXHAUSTED. HE CAN'T STAND UP.

40:30.773 --> 40:33.569
THE BELL FOR ROUND 13.

40:33.603 --> 40:37.918
JOE FRAZIER'S LEFT EYE IS
A MESS. NO OTHER WAY TO PUT IT.

40:37.952 --> 40:40.783
IT'S BEEN ANOTHER GRUELING,
BRUISING STRUGGLE

40:40.817 --> 40:42.198
BETWEEN THE TWO...

40:42.232 --> 40:44.027
IT WAS SO BRUTAL,
BRUTAL.

40:44.062 --> 40:45.788
EACH MAN GIVING
EVERYTHING,

40:45.822 --> 40:48.204
IN SOME WAYS REMINISCENT
OF THE CLASSIC FIRST FIGHT

40:48.238 --> 40:50.896
IN MARCH OF '71.

40:50.931 --> 40:53.899
THERE'S ALI ACTUALLY--

40:53.934 --> 40:56.212
THE MOUTHPIECE WENT
FROM THE RIGHT LEAD.

40:56.246 --> 40:58.179
THE MOUTHPIECE
WENT. YOU SAW IT FLY OUT.

40:58.214 --> 41:01.182
ALI IS NOW REALLY
GIVING IT TO FRAZIER.

41:01.217 --> 41:03.046
FRAZIER'S IN TROUBLE.

41:03.081 --> 41:06.809
JOE COMING BACK TO
THE MIDSECTION, BUT ALI COVERED.

41:09.052 --> 41:12.504
LESS THAN A MINUTE LEFT
IN THE 13th ROUND

41:12.539 --> 41:14.817
WITH ALI PUNISHING FRAZIER.

41:14.851 --> 41:19.511
ALREADY THE MOUTHPIECE IS GONE.
HE HAS STAGGERED FRAZIER.

41:22.031 --> 41:25.310
FRAZIER, HIS LEGS
ARE LIKE WET SPAGHETTI.

41:25.344 --> 41:28.727
ALI DOESN'T LOOK TOO GOOD
EITHER.

41:28.762 --> 41:31.799
THAT'S HOW MUCH THESE GUYS
LEFT IN THE ROUND.

41:31.834 --> 41:37.529
BY THE TIME THEY GET TO
THE 14th ROUND, I SAY,

41:37.564 --> 41:41.119
"I WISH THIS THING WOULD END.
WHY DON'T THEY SEND THEM HOME?

41:41.153 --> 41:43.535
TELL 'EM IT'S A DRAW.
YOU BOTH ARE GREAT. GO HOME."

41:43.570 --> 41:46.158
I CAN'T WATCH IT ANYMORE.

41:46.193 --> 41:48.195
ALI IS GIVING IT
TO HIM AGAIN,

41:48.229 --> 41:50.024
AND JOE CAN'T ANSWER BACK.

41:50.059 --> 41:52.095
THE SWINGS ARE WILD.

41:52.130 --> 41:56.134
ALI IN TOTAL COMMAND.

41:56.168 --> 41:59.275
LOOK AT THAT,
LEFT AND THEN THE RIGHT...

41:59.309 --> 42:01.933
IN THE LAST MINUTE OF
THE 14th ROUND,

42:01.967 --> 42:03.935
ALI UNLEASHED A FLURRY OF BLOWS

42:03.969 --> 42:08.284
TO FRAZIER'S ALREADY
SWOLLEN AND BLOODIED FACE.

42:08.318 --> 42:13.772
SOMEHOW, FRAZIER
STAYED ON HIS FEET.

42:13.807 --> 42:15.636
MUHAMMAD HIT HIM
WITH, I THINK, LIKE,

42:15.671 --> 42:17.914
IT WAS TWO OR THREE SHOTS
AT THE CLOSE OF THE ROUND.

42:17.949 --> 42:20.261
AND THOSE TWO OR THREE SHOTS
DISORIENTED JOE.

42:24.127 --> 42:28.338
THE BELL RINGS, AND THE REFEREE
HAS TO STEER HIM

42:28.373 --> 42:30.064
BACK TO HIS CORNER.

42:30.099 --> 42:34.621
AND HE'S DAMAGED,
BUT HE DOESN'T WANT TO QUIT.

42:34.655 --> 42:38.763
"NAH, NAH, DON'T--DON'T--
DON'T STOP IT. DON'T STOP IT."

42:38.797 --> 42:41.800
MUHAMMAD, HE'S OUT OF IT.

42:41.835 --> 42:47.185
HE SAID THAT THAT FIGHT WAS
THE CLOSEST THING TO DEATH.

42:47.219 --> 42:49.705
HE'S NEAR DEATH.

42:49.739 --> 42:51.983
EDDIE FUTCH
LEANING OVER HIS FIGHTER.

42:52.017 --> 42:54.054
LOOK AT FRAZIER'S EYES.

42:54.088 --> 42:57.920
EDDIE FUTCH HAD SEEN
FOUR FIGHTERS DIE IN THE RING.

42:57.954 --> 43:01.371
HE REFUSED TO LET
HIS BOXER CONTINUE.

43:01.406 --> 43:05.928
"JOE," HE SAID. "IT'S OVER."

43:05.962 --> 43:10.173
FRAZIER DIDN'T WANT
TO QUIT. FUTCH MADE HIM QUIT.

43:10.208 --> 43:13.418
ONE OF THE GREAT MOMENTS
IN BOXING HISTORY, ACTUALLY.

43:13.452 --> 43:16.870
FUTCH DOESN'T WANT
THE FIGHTER TO GO ON,

43:16.904 --> 43:18.423
TELLING THE REFEREE.

43:18.457 --> 43:22.427
JOE FRAZIER IS IN
HIS CORNER, ON THE STOOL.

43:22.461 --> 43:24.153
LOOK AT ALI GETTING
READY TO GO OUT.

43:24.187 --> 43:27.018
NOW HE REALIZES FRAZIER
WILL NOT COME OUT.

43:27.052 --> 43:29.296
MUHAMMAD ALI IS

43:29.330 --> 43:32.886
STILL THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION
OF THE WORLD.

43:32.920 --> 43:35.820
IT ASKED
EVERYTHING OF THEM,

43:35.854 --> 43:38.719
AND THEY GAVE EVERYTHING,
YOU KNOW.

43:38.754 --> 43:41.653
AND YOU DON'T SEE THAT
HAPPEN VERY OFTEN IN ANY--

43:41.688 --> 43:44.242
IN ANYTHING, ANY GAME,
ANY LIFE, YOU KNOW.

43:44.276 --> 43:46.451
AND THERE IT'S NAKED.

43:46.485 --> 43:48.867
THERE YOU COULDN'T MISS IT.

43:48.902 --> 43:52.319
AS ALI'S CORNER
CROWDED AROUND HIM TO CELEBRATE,

43:52.353 --> 43:55.460
HE COLLAPSED ONTO THE CANVAS.

43:55.494 --> 43:59.188
THEY TURNED EACH OTHER
INTO MONSTERS, YOU KNOW.

43:59.222 --> 44:03.330
AND THAT'S BOXING
AT ITS CRUELEST, YOU KNOW,

44:03.364 --> 44:05.746
BUT THAT'S WHAT THE GAME IS,
YOU KNOW.

44:05.781 --> 44:08.438
IT'S A NAKED ASSAULT
ON THE BRAIN, YOU KNOW.

44:08.473 --> 44:10.993
IT'S A CRUEL GAME.

44:11.027 --> 44:14.755
AND THEY WERE AT THEIR
BEST CRUELEST THAT NIGHT.

44:14.790 --> 44:19.139
THEY DIDN'T FIGHT
FOR THE WBC CHAMPIONSHIP.

44:19.173 --> 44:22.729
THEY DIDN'T FIGHT
FOR THE WBA CHAMPIONSHIP.

44:22.763 --> 44:26.905
THEY DIDN'T FIGHT FOR
THE CHAMPIONSHIP OF THE PLANET.

44:26.940 --> 44:30.460
THEY STOOD TOE-TO-TOE
ON A MELTING ICE FLOE

44:30.495 --> 44:34.223
AND FOUGHT FOR
THE CHAMPIONSHIP OF EACH OTHER.

44:34.257 --> 44:38.848
AND FOR EACH OF THEM, THE OTHER
GUY WAS AHAB'S WHITE WHALE.

44:41.333 --> 44:43.197
FRAZIER WAS TOO BATTERED

44:43.232 --> 44:46.269
TO ATTEND THE RECEPTION AT THE
PRESIDENTIAL PALACE THAT NIGHT.

44:46.304 --> 44:49.894
ALI WOULD URINATE BLOOD
FOR WEEKS.

44:49.928 --> 44:53.725
"WE WENT TO MANILA AS
CHAMPIONS," ALI SAID LATER,

44:53.760 --> 44:57.246
"AND WE CAME BACK AS OLD MEN."

44:57.280 --> 45:00.111
THAT WAS LIKE, YOU KNOW,
A BARE KNUCKLES MATCH, MAN,

45:00.145 --> 45:02.389
AT LIKE THE BAR DOWN THE STREET.

45:02.423 --> 45:04.391
WHAT MUHAMMAD ALI
AND JOE FRAZIER EXPRESSED WAS

45:04.425 --> 45:06.773
MAJESTIC, MAN.

45:06.807 --> 45:10.362
IT WAS VIOLENT AND CONFLICTING
AND AT TIMES, LIKE, YOU KNOW,

45:10.397 --> 45:13.089
QUITE MOVING.

45:13.124 --> 45:15.782
THAT'S THEIR GIFT TO US.

45:20.027 --> 45:22.754
I'M GIVING YOU A FEW MINUTES,
AND THEN I'M LEAVING.

45:22.789 --> 45:24.514
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT
TO SAY ABOUT JOE FRAZIER NOW?

45:24.549 --> 45:26.413
HE'S GREAT.

45:26.447 --> 45:29.174
HE'S GREATER THAN
I THOUGHT HE WAS.

45:29.209 --> 45:33.869
WHEN I SAY GREAT, HIS STYLE
IS THE STYLE THAT

45:33.903 --> 45:36.492
ONLY HE CAN BE
SUCCESSFUL WITH.

45:36.526 --> 45:38.459
I THINK HE FOUGHT
A GOOD FIGHT.

45:38.494 --> 45:41.773
WATCHING THE INTERVIEWS
AFTER THE THRILLA IN MANILA,

45:41.808 --> 45:43.879
IT'S APPARENT ALREADY.

45:43.913 --> 45:45.846
HE'S TALKING
DIFFERENTLY, SLOWER.

45:45.881 --> 45:48.021
SOMETHING'S OFF.

45:48.055 --> 45:52.957
IT'S HARD, BECAUSE,
SLOWLY, WE'RE GOING TO SEE

45:52.991 --> 45:54.855
A DIFFERENT HUMAN BEING,

45:54.890 --> 45:58.548
AND WE'RE GOING TO WATCH
THIS MAN DETERIORATE IN PUBLIC,

45:58.583 --> 46:01.275
ONE OF THE MOST
HEARTBREAKING THINGS EVER.

46:06.108 --> 46:11.078
BY THE SPRING OF 1976,
HE AND KHALILAH WERE SEPARATED

46:11.113 --> 46:13.460
AND EACH LIVING
IN THEIR OWN APARTMENTS.

46:13.494 --> 46:16.463
"THERE ISN'T ANY MARRIAGE,"
SHE TOLD ONE REPORTER.

46:16.497 --> 46:18.948
"IT'S PAST ME NOW."

46:18.983 --> 46:23.090
I DECIDED I'M
GONNA HAVE TO DIVORCE THE GUY.

46:23.125 --> 46:29.096
I'VE BEARED A LOT OF
EMBARRASSING SITUATIONS.

46:29.131 --> 46:32.548
I BLAME MYSELF, AND, YOU KNOW,

46:32.582 --> 46:35.551
I JUST DIDN'T CARE EITHER
AFTER A WHILE,

46:35.585 --> 46:37.898
AND IT HURT ME, TOO.

46:37.933 --> 46:41.039
MY DAD AND MY MOM DIVORCED

46:41.074 --> 46:45.147
WHEN WE WERE VERY YOUNG.
WE WERE, LIKE, FIVE.

46:45.181 --> 46:48.426
MOST OF MY GROWING UP, I
LIVED WITH MY GRANDPARENTS,

46:48.460 --> 46:50.255
MY MOM'S PARENTS.

46:50.290 --> 46:55.191
AND I DIDN'T HAVE THE PRIVILEGE

46:55.226 --> 46:59.023
OF HAVING MY DAD WITH ME
AFTER THE DIVORCE, OBVIOUSLY.

46:59.057 --> 47:03.406
IT WAS A PAINFUL TIME FOR US.

47:03.441 --> 47:06.306
AND, YOU KNOW, WE MISSED HIM.

47:06.340 --> 47:09.516
VERONICA
WAS PREGNANT NOW.

47:09.550 --> 47:12.381
THEY WERE SPENDING TIME
AT AN 80-ACRE FARM

47:12.415 --> 47:14.038
IN BERRIEN SPRINGS, MICHIGAN,

47:14.072 --> 47:17.455
THAT ALI HAD PURCHASED
THE PREVIOUS FALL.

47:17.489 --> 47:19.284
WE WERE IN LOVE.

47:19.319 --> 47:23.323
AND I KNEW HOW MUCH HE LOVED ME.
HE KNEW I LOVED HIM.

47:23.357 --> 47:28.466
HE KNEW I WAS LOYAL
TO HIM ONLY, NOBODY ELSE.

47:28.500 --> 47:31.918
AND I KNOW HE
APPRECIATED THAT A LOT.

47:31.952 --> 47:38.648
AND, YOU KNOW,
WE WERE ALWAYS TOGETHER.

47:38.683 --> 47:41.548
I WANTED TO HAVE KIDS.

47:41.582 --> 47:46.587
SO HANA WAS VERY WELCOME,
YOU KNOW.

47:46.622 --> 47:49.418
ALI'S MOTHER ODESSA,

47:49.452 --> 47:52.007
TIRED OF HER HUSBAND'S
DRINKING AND CAROUSING,

47:52.041 --> 47:54.147
HAD SEPARATED
FROM CASSIUS CLAY SENIOR,

47:54.181 --> 47:56.908
AND MOVED INTO ANOTHER HOUSE
IN LOUISVILLE,

47:56.943 --> 47:59.221
BOUGHT FOR HER BY HER SON.

47:59.255 --> 48:04.088
ALI HAD TOLD WALLACE MUHAMMAD
HE WAS FINISHED WITH BOXING,

48:04.122 --> 48:07.470
BUT HE NEEDED THE HUGE
PAYDAYS TO MEET

48:07.505 --> 48:09.472
HIS EVER-INCREASING EXPENSES.

48:11.509 --> 48:14.615
HE FOUGHT FIVE TIMES
IN 15 MONTHS.

48:14.650 --> 48:16.963
JEAN-PIERRE COOPMAN,

48:16.997 --> 48:18.930
JIMMY YOUNG,

48:18.965 --> 48:20.690
RICHARD DUNN,

48:20.725 --> 48:23.452
KEN NORTON FOR A THIRD TIME,

48:23.486 --> 48:27.939
ALFREDO EVANGELISTA.

48:27.974 --> 48:31.598
THOUGH HE WON
EACH TIME, THE 35-YEAR-OLD ALI

48:31.632 --> 48:33.565
WAS CLEARLY IN DECLINE,

48:33.600 --> 48:36.189
SLOGGING THROUGH ROUND
AFTER PUNISHING ROUND,

48:36.223 --> 48:41.021
UNABLE TO AVOID PUNCHES THAT HE
HAD ONCE DODGED WITH EASE.

48:41.056 --> 48:43.679
AFTER A BRUTAL 15-ROUND VICTORY

48:43.713 --> 48:47.579
OVER EARNIE SHAVERS
IN SEPTEMBER OF 1977,

48:47.614 --> 48:50.444
SOME OF HIS ASSOCIATES
HAD SEEN ENOUGH.

48:50.479 --> 48:54.310
TEDDY BRENNER, MADISON SQUARE
GARDEN'S PROMOTER,

48:54.345 --> 48:56.657
TOLD HERBERT MUHAMMAD
THAT THE GARDEN

48:56.692 --> 48:59.557
WOULD NOT OFFER ALI
ANOTHER FIGHT.

48:59.591 --> 49:01.731
"I WISH HE CALLS IT A DAY
BEFORE HE

49:01.766 --> 49:04.458
FALLS OFF THE TIGHTROPE,"
SAID BRENNER.

49:04.493 --> 49:08.462
LAB TESTS BY THE NEW YORK
STATE ATHLETIC COMMISSION

49:08.497 --> 49:12.190
REVEALED THAT ALI'S KIDNEYS
WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DAMAGED

49:12.225 --> 49:15.331
AND COULD FAIL IF EXPOSED
TO MORE PUNISHMENT.

49:15.366 --> 49:19.094
"HE SHOULD QUIT AND QUIT NOW,"
SAID FERDIE PACHECO,

49:19.128 --> 49:21.786
WHO, AFTER 15 YEARS
AS ALI'S RINGSIDE DOCTOR,

49:21.820 --> 49:25.031
DECIDED TO MOVE ON.

49:25.065 --> 49:30.484
HIS FATHER TOLD HIM, "QUIT,
SON, BEFORE YOU GET HURT."

49:30.519 --> 49:33.073
HE STARTS ASKING PEOPLE,
"DO YOU THINK I SOUND DIFFERENT?

49:33.108 --> 49:35.075
DO YOU THINK MY WORDS
ARE SLURRING?"

49:35.110 --> 49:36.594
YOU KNOW, "DO I SEEM
DIFFERENT TO YOU?

49:36.628 --> 49:38.423
DO YOU THINK I'M BRAIN DAMAGED?"

49:38.458 --> 49:39.804
HE'S ASKING REPORTERS
THIS QUESTION,

49:39.838 --> 49:41.771
AND IT'S HEARTBREAKING,

49:41.806 --> 49:44.222
AND HIS FATHER AND HIS MOTHER
ARE TELLING HIM, YOU KNOW,

49:44.257 --> 49:46.362
"YOU DON'T SOUND THE SAME.
YOU DON'T SOUND RIGHT.

49:46.397 --> 49:48.778
WHY CAN'T YOU SPEAK RIGHT?"

49:48.813 --> 49:52.230
AND HE KEEPS BOXING,
AS HE BELIEVES LIKE,

49:52.265 --> 49:53.576
AS HE'S ALWAYS BELIEVED,
THAT YOU KNOW,

49:53.611 --> 49:56.200
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

49:56.234 --> 50:00.583
ANGELO DUNDEE
CALLED IT ALI'S DECISION.

50:00.618 --> 50:03.655
"ONLY WHEN THE MAN COMES TO ME
AND ASKS DO I TELL HIM

50:03.690 --> 50:06.624
WHAT'S IN MY HEART,"
SAID THE TRAINER.

50:06.658 --> 50:10.455
EVERYBODY WANTED HIM
TO RETIRE THAT CARED ABOUT HIM.

50:10.490 --> 50:14.804
BUT THERE WAS ALWAYS THAT FIGHT

50:14.839 --> 50:17.152
THAT SOMEBODY WOULD CALL HIM
ABOUT,

50:17.186 --> 50:20.051
AND USUALLY IT WAS HERBERT.

50:20.086 --> 50:24.538
I THINK OF EVERYONE,
MUHAMMAD RESPECTED

50:24.573 --> 50:28.059
HERBERT MUHAMMAD'S OPINION
THE MOST.

50:28.094 --> 50:34.169
HERBERT GREW TO HAVE A CERTAIN
LIFESTYLE BECAUSE OF MUHAMMAD.

50:34.203 --> 50:38.828
I THINK HE WAS INFLUENTIAL
IN HIM CONTINUING TO FIGHT,

50:38.863 --> 50:43.247
BECAUSE IT MEANT MORE MONEY
FOR HIM.

50:45.283 --> 50:48.217
THE PROMOTER BOB ARUM
HAD ALREADY IDENTIFIED

50:48.252 --> 50:51.703
THE CHAMP'S NEXT OPPONENT,
A 24-YEAR-OLD EX-MARINE

50:51.738 --> 50:56.363
NAMED LEON SPINKS, WHO HAD WON
GOLD AS A LIGHT HEAVYWEIGHT

50:56.398 --> 50:59.401
AT THE 1976 OLYMPICS.

50:59.435 --> 51:04.716
THE 15-ROUND MATCH
WAS SET FOR FEBRUARY 1978.

51:04.751 --> 51:08.306
VICTOR SOLANO, AN AMATEUR BOXER

51:08.341 --> 51:09.825
WHO HAD BEFRIENDED ALI

51:09.859 --> 51:11.861
AFTER A SPARRING SESSION
IN LOS ANGELES,

51:11.896 --> 51:14.899
TRIED TO HELP MUHAMMAD PREPARE.

51:14.933 --> 51:16.797
HE ONLY TRAINED
FOR ABOUT TWO WEEKS

51:16.832 --> 51:18.868
FOR THAT FIGHT,

51:18.903 --> 51:21.388
AND HE GOES, "OH, THIS GUY'S
JUST AN AMATEUR.

51:21.423 --> 51:23.735
"HE'S JUST AN AMATEUR,
AND I FOUGHT JOE FRAZIER.

51:23.770 --> 51:25.772
"I FOUGHT GEORGE FOREMAN.
I FOUGHT ALL THESE GUYS.

51:25.806 --> 51:28.154
THIS GUY'S ONLY HAD SIX FIGHTS."

51:28.188 --> 51:30.328
SO HE WOULD RUN
MAYBE A FEW BLOCKS,

51:30.363 --> 51:32.813
GET BACK IN THE LIMOUSINE,
GO BACK TO SLEEP.

51:34.608 --> 51:38.509
SPINKS TOOK ALI
COMPLETELY BY SURPRISE.

51:38.543 --> 51:40.235
SPINKS COMES FLYING OUT HERE

51:40.269 --> 51:42.513
AND GOES RIGHT AFTER
THIS GREAT CHAMPION,

51:42.547 --> 51:44.618
ABSOLUTELY SHOWING
NO RESPECT AT ALL.

51:44.653 --> 51:48.243
SPINKS DID A LOT OF DAMAGE
TO HIM, A LOT OF DAMAGE.

51:48.277 --> 51:50.590
ALI SHOULD BE
PUNCHING WITH BOTH HANDS,

51:50.624 --> 51:52.799
BUT INSTEAD IT'S SPINKS
WHO COMES BACK,

51:52.833 --> 51:55.250
AND HE'S THROWING EVERYTHING
HE'S GOT IN BOTH PUNCHES.

51:55.284 --> 51:57.321
ALI IS COVERING UP.
HE'S KEEPING HIM IN HIS CORNER.

51:57.355 --> 51:59.357
HE WILL NOT LET HIM OUT.
ALI'S GOT TO GO TOE-TO-TOE...

51:59.392 --> 52:01.428
HE THOUGHT,
"WELL...I'VE DONE IT BEFORE,

52:01.463 --> 52:02.947
"I'LL DO IT AGAIN.

52:02.981 --> 52:04.466
"THE LAST ROUND
I'M GOING TO COME OUT,

52:04.500 --> 52:05.881
AND I'M GOING TO GIVE IT
ALL I GOT."

52:05.915 --> 52:07.434
SPINKS IS
IN THE CORNER,

52:07.469 --> 52:09.436
AND ALI'S GOT HIM
WHERE HE WANTS HIM.

52:09.471 --> 52:11.231
AND SPINKS COMES BACK
WITH A COUNTER, ANOTHER COUNTER,

52:11.266 --> 52:12.819
ANOTHER, ANOTHER.

52:12.853 --> 52:14.717
AND THERE'S SPINKS
BACKING UP THE CHAMPION...

52:14.752 --> 52:17.168
BUT THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT.
THERE--THERE WAS NOTHING.

52:17.203 --> 52:18.963
IT'S EIGHT SECONDS AWAY...

52:18.997 --> 52:21.931
HE'S JUST HAMMERED ALI.
ALI LOOKS LIKE HE'S IN TROUBLE.

52:21.966 --> 52:23.623
HE'S LEANING AGAINST THE ROPES.

52:23.657 --> 52:26.936
TWO SECONDS. IT'S ONE,
AND AT THE BELL...

52:26.971 --> 52:32.908
JUDGE
HAROLD BUCK SCORES 144-141.

52:32.942 --> 52:36.291
THE NEW...
THERE IT IS!

52:36.325 --> 52:38.638
LEON SPINKS HAS PULLED IT OFF.

52:38.672 --> 52:40.847
AFTER
ONLY SEVEN PROFESSIONAL WINS,

52:40.881 --> 52:44.540
LEON SPINKS WAS HEAVYWEIGHT
CHAMPION OF THE WORLD.

52:44.575 --> 52:46.577
BEATING MAYBE THE
GREATEST FIGHTER OF ALL TIME...

52:46.611 --> 52:49.683
ALI SAID TO ME,
"BOB, YOU GOT TO DO ME A FAVOR.

52:49.718 --> 52:51.754
YOU GOT TO MAKE THE REMATCH."

52:51.789 --> 52:54.999
AND I SAID, "ALI, I'LL MAKE THE

52:55.033 --> 52:58.209
WIN OR LOSE,
IT'S THE END, YOU'LL RETIRE."

52:58.244 --> 53:00.832
"I PROMISE YOU,"
AND HE AGREED TO RETIRE.

53:00.867 --> 53:03.387
BUT NOW I GOT BEAT.
I'M ALL WASHED UP.

53:03.421 --> 53:06.286
"TIME"
"THE GREATEST' IS GONE."

53:06.321 --> 53:08.288
"HE'S WASHED UP. HE'S OLD."

53:08.323 --> 53:10.221
NOW I GOT SOMETHING TO
GET UP AND PROVE,

53:10.256 --> 53:12.948
TO SET A RECORD THAT YOU
KNOW WON'T--NEVER BE BROKEN

53:12.982 --> 53:14.708
IN THE NEXT HUNDRED,
TWO HUNDRED YEARS.

53:14.743 --> 53:16.745
I MEAN, TO WIN THE TITLE
BACK FOR THE THIRD TIME...

53:16.779 --> 53:21.543
AND HE GOT HUMBLE,
AND THEN THAT'S WHEN HE SAID,

53:21.577 --> 53:23.476
"YOU KNOW, I'M GOING TO GET UP

53:23.510 --> 53:25.823
"AND RUN WITH THE MOON
AND THE STARS.

53:25.857 --> 53:28.343
"I'M GOING TO GO BACK
AND CHOP TREES,

53:28.377 --> 53:31.829
AND GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING
TO WHAT MADE ME GREAT."

53:35.453 --> 53:38.801
PRESENTING THE CHALLENGER

53:38.836 --> 53:41.252
OF TONIGHT'S BOUT...

53:41.287 --> 53:44.945
THE FORMER TWO-TIME
GREAT CHAMPION

53:44.980 --> 53:48.880
FROM LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY,
IN WHITE TRUNKS,

53:48.915 --> 53:51.573
WEIGHING IN AT 221--

53:51.607 --> 53:53.713
MUHAMMAD ALI, THE GREATEST.

53:53.747 --> 53:55.301
WELL, I THINK

53:55.335 --> 53:56.543
HIS BRAVEST FIGHT WAS

53:56.578 --> 53:58.511
THE SECOND ONE WITH SPINKS.

53:58.545 --> 53:59.995
YOU KNOW?

54:00.029 --> 54:01.376
HE GOES THERE,
HE'S TOO OLD TO BE BOXING.

54:01.410 --> 54:02.894
HE SHOULDN'T BE BOXING ANYMORE.

54:02.929 --> 54:06.519
BUT HE SAID,
"BUT THIS GUY BEAT ME, OK."

54:06.553 --> 54:09.798
AND HE PLANNED
THE PERFECT FIGHT.

54:11.938 --> 54:13.940
ROUND ONE.

54:13.974 --> 54:15.562
THE CHAMPION SPINKS COMING

54:15.597 --> 54:18.047
RIGHT OUT AGAINST

54:18.082 --> 54:21.050
A MOVING AND DANCING
MUHAMMAD ALI...

54:21.085 --> 54:23.915
ALI IS
LURING HIM INTO THESE TRAPS.

54:23.950 --> 54:26.918
LOOK AT ALI DANCE.
HE'S A THING OF BEAUTY.

54:26.953 --> 54:29.852
A LITTLE SHUFFLE IN THE NEUTRAL
CORNER BY THE FORMER CHAMPION.

54:29.887 --> 54:33.339
THE CHAMPION IS--THE FORMER
CHAMPION STILL MOVING,

54:33.373 --> 54:37.066
STILL FRUSTRATING
THE CHAMPION, LEON SPINKS.

54:37.101 --> 54:39.517
OH! A GREAT RIGHT HAND BY ALI.

54:39.552 --> 54:41.001
A TERRIFIC
RIGHT HAND TO SPINKS,

54:41.036 --> 54:42.900
AND HE GRIMACED.

54:42.934 --> 54:46.559
COMING IN, HE GOT
ANOTHER RIGHT HAND IN HIS FACE.

54:46.593 --> 54:49.631
ANOTHER RIGHT HAND.

54:49.665 --> 54:51.633
AND WITH THE FINAL 10 SECONDS
IN ROUND 4...

54:51.667 --> 54:54.705
AND JUST WATCHING IT
WAS, LIKE, AMAZING.

54:56.569 --> 54:58.364
OK, THEY'RE OUT
IN THE MIDDLE FOR ROUND EIGHT.

54:58.398 --> 54:59.779
AND HE OPENED IT
WITH TWO GOOD HOOKS

54:59.813 --> 55:02.333
RIGHT OFF OF SPINKS' JAW.

55:02.368 --> 55:05.371
OH! A GREAT LEFT
HOOK, AND SPINKS MAY BE HURT.

55:05.405 --> 55:11.342
OVER 15 ROUNDS,
ALI COMPLETELY OUT-BOXED SPINKS.

55:11.377 --> 55:14.345
IT'S ALL ALI.
IT'S ALL ALI.

55:14.380 --> 55:16.554
- - 30
REMAINING IN THIS FIGHT.

55:16.589 --> 55:18.867
AND NOW HERE IN NEW ORLEANS,

55:18.901 --> 55:22.595
AT THE AGE OF 36 YEARS OLD,
HE IS SHOWING A YOUNG MAN

55:22.629 --> 55:24.735
WHAT BOXING IS ALL ABOUT.

55:24.769 --> 55:27.600
HE IS SHOWING A YOUNG
LEON SPINKS WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE

55:27.634 --> 55:29.360
IN WITH THE REAL MUHAMMAD ALI.

55:29.395 --> 55:31.051
THAT IS ABOUT IT, FOLKS.

55:31.086 --> 55:32.881
IT'S ALL OVER.

55:32.915 --> 55:37.126
THE NEW
CHAMPION, MUHAMMAD ALI...

55:37.161 --> 55:39.922
MUHAMMAD ALI HAD WON
THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP

55:39.957 --> 55:43.478
FOR THE THIRD TIME,
SOMETHING NO ONE IN HISTORY

55:43.512 --> 55:46.722
HAD EVER DONE BEFORE.

55:46.757 --> 55:49.794
"THANK GOD IT'S OVER," SAID ALI.

55:53.798 --> 55:59.010
I NOTICED
A COUPLE OF TIMES,

55:59.045 --> 56:01.875
THERE WAS LIKE A LITTLE SHAKE
ON THE THUMB.

56:01.910 --> 56:04.982
A LITTLE BIT, EVEN AT THAT TIME.

56:05.016 --> 56:08.572
I NOTICED SOMETIMES MAYBE
AFTER...HITTING THE SPEED BAG,

56:08.606 --> 56:11.954
THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF
A TREMBLE, A LITTLE SLIGHTLY,

56:11.989 --> 56:14.750
BUT YOU COULDN'T SEE--
YOU HAD TO SEE IT, YOU KNOW,

56:14.785 --> 56:17.650
BUT YOU KNEW SOMETHING
WAS ALREADY WRONG.

56:17.684 --> 56:21.101
MY MOM USED TO SAY
THAT SHE SAW SIGNS

56:21.136 --> 56:23.483
AS EARLY AS THE SPINKS FIGHTS.

56:23.518 --> 56:25.692
AND IF YOU REALLY LOOK BACK,
A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT

56:25.727 --> 56:27.694
THAT MY FATHER WAS JUST MATURE.

56:27.729 --> 56:30.490
HE WAS SPEAKING MORE SLOWLY.
HE'S OLDER NOW.

56:30.525 --> 56:32.941
I SAID, "BUT HE WAS
NOT REALLY THAT OLD."

56:32.975 --> 56:35.702
HE JUST DIDN'T FEEL THE SAME.
HE THOUGHT IT WAS AGE.

56:35.737 --> 56:38.153
AND BECAUSE HE WAS
SO EXTRAORDINARILY QUICK

56:38.187 --> 56:41.950
WITH HIS MOVEMENTS
AND HIS SPEED AND HIS SPEECH,

56:41.984 --> 56:44.470
THAT WHEN HE SORT OF
SLOWED DOWN,

56:44.504 --> 56:46.230
PEOPLE JUST ASSUMED IT
WAS JUST AGE.

56:49.889 --> 56:54.445
IN JANUARY OF 1979,
ALI AND VERONICA,

56:54.480 --> 56:56.136
NOW LEGALLY MARRIED,

56:56.171 --> 56:58.484
BOUGHT A MANSION
IN THE HANCOCK PARK SECTION

56:58.518 --> 57:00.037
OF LOS ANGELES.

57:00.071 --> 57:03.868
IN ADDITION TO TWO-YEAR-OLD
HANA, THEY HAD

57:03.903 --> 57:07.941
A SECOND DAUGHTER, LAILA,
WHO HAD JUST TURNED ONE.

57:07.976 --> 57:13.706
IN JUNE, ALI OFFICIALLY RETIRED,
QUIETLY RELINQUISHING HIS TITLE

57:13.740 --> 57:16.743
IN A LETTER TO
THE WORLD BOXING ASSOCIATION.

57:16.778 --> 57:19.884
HE WENT ON A FAREWELL TOUR...

57:19.919 --> 57:22.128
HASH BROWNS? ORE IDA?

57:22.162 --> 57:23.819
...ENDORSED
SCORES OF PRODUCTS...

57:23.854 --> 57:25.752
MOTORCRAFT PARTS,
THEY HAVE THE STUFF.

57:25.787 --> 57:27.582
MOTORCRAFT IS TESTED TOUGH.

57:27.616 --> 57:29.825
...ACTED
IN FILM AND ON TELEVISION...

57:29.860 --> 57:31.896
I'M JUST A SIMPLE MAN...

57:31.931 --> 57:34.243
AND FOUGHT IN
SEEMINGLY HARMLESS

57:34.278 --> 57:36.694
EXHIBITION MATCHES
AROUND THE WORLD.

57:39.041 --> 57:42.010
BUT HE GREW BORED.

57:42.044 --> 57:46.117
ON FEBRUARY 15, 1980,
HE TOLD A REPORTER

57:46.152 --> 57:48.637
FROM THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
THAT HE HAD BEEN APPROACHED

57:48.672 --> 57:51.157
BY PROMOTERS
AND WAS INCREASINGLY SURE

57:51.191 --> 57:54.160
HE WOULD RETURN TO THE RING
AFTER ALL.

57:54.194 --> 57:57.784
NOW 38 YEARS OLD,
HIS HAIR GRAYING,

57:57.819 --> 58:02.271
AND, ACCORDING TO SOME REPORTS,
WEIGHING ALMOST 270 POUNDS,

58:02.306 --> 58:06.137
ALI HADN'T HAD A REAL FIGHT
IN 17 MONTHS.

58:06.172 --> 58:10.003
ALMOST NO ONE BELIEVED
IT WAS A GOOD IDEA.

58:10.038 --> 58:14.214
"I DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM FIGHT
ANYMORE," SAID ODESSA CLAY.

58:14.249 --> 58:18.840
BUT SOON, DON KING PHONED
HERBERT AND ALI WITH AN OFFER.

58:18.874 --> 58:20.566
THE PROMOTER NOW MANAGED

58:20.600 --> 58:22.706
A FORMER SPARRING PARTNER
OF ALI'S,

58:22.740 --> 58:25.294
WHO HAD RECENTLY CAPTURED
THE HEAVYWEIGHT TITLE.

58:25.329 --> 58:28.712
"IF YOU'RE GOING TO COME BACK,"
KING TOLD THEM,

58:28.746 --> 58:31.231
"YOU CAN ONLY FIGHT
LARRY HOLMES."

58:35.063 --> 58:36.858
HE WAS 30 YEARS OLD

58:36.892 --> 58:41.725
AND UNDEFEATED
IN 35 PROFESSIONAL FIGHTS.

58:41.759 --> 58:43.658
HE WAS MY FRIEND.

58:43.692 --> 58:45.625
WHEN ALI CAME TO MY FIGHTS
TO SEE ME IN THE RING BOXING,

58:45.660 --> 58:47.213
HE'S SITTING THERE AT RINGSIDE,

58:47.247 --> 58:48.904
MAN, YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I--

58:48.939 --> 58:51.148
"MAN. YEAH, ALI, HE'S WATCHING
ME FIGHT!"

58:51.182 --> 58:52.977
MAN, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

58:53.012 --> 58:54.910
I MEAN, I WAS LIKE
A LITTLE KID IN THE PLAYGROUND.

58:54.945 --> 58:56.602
MUHAMMAD ALI HAS SEEN
THE BRIGHT SIDE,

58:56.636 --> 58:58.638
AND NOW HE'S ON THE DARK SIDE.

58:58.673 --> 59:00.122
I'M THE LIGHT SIDE NOW.

59:00.157 --> 59:02.055
WHAT DO YOU
THINK YOU'LL DO WITH HIM?

59:02.090 --> 59:03.712
BEAT MUHAMMAD ALI,
OF COURSE,

59:03.747 --> 59:04.989
BUT I WILL FEEL SAD

59:05.024 --> 59:06.715
ABOUT BEATING MUHAMMAD ALI

59:06.750 --> 59:08.234
BECAUSE MUHAMMAD IS
A LEGEND IN HIS OWN TIME.

59:08.268 --> 59:11.030
NOW HIS TIME HAS PASSED.
IT'S MY TIME NOW.

59:11.064 --> 59:13.722
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE NEVER
FOUGHT ME.

59:13.757 --> 59:15.759
BUT TO GET THAT $10 MILLION,

59:15.793 --> 59:17.761
THAT $10 MILLION

59:17.795 --> 59:20.211
WILL MAKE YOU WANT TO FIGHT
HOLMES AND EVERYBODY ELSE.

59:20.246 --> 59:21.937
AND THAT'S WHAT HE DID.

59:21.972 --> 59:24.181
AND THAT'S HOW I GOT
IN TO FIGHT ALI.

59:24.215 --> 59:27.184
THE BOXERS AGREED
TO FACE EACH OTHER IN LAS VEGAS

59:27.218 --> 59:29.738
IN THE FALL OF 1980.

59:29.773 --> 59:32.327
"SOME OF OUR MOSQUES ARE
IN TROUBLE,

59:32.361 --> 59:35.710
AND SOME OF OUR SCHOOLS
ARE CLOSING," EXPLAINED ALI.

59:35.744 --> 59:38.609
"I WOULD RETURN TO KEEP
THEM OPEN."

59:38.644 --> 59:41.819
WHEN ALI FOUGHT LARRY HOLMES,
HE SAID,

59:41.854 --> 59:43.683
"I TAUGHT HIM
EVERYTHING HE KNOWS.

59:43.718 --> 59:45.823
I DIDN'T TEACH
HIM EVERYTHING I KNOW."

59:45.858 --> 59:47.169
I TAUGHT HIM
HOW TO TRAIN.

59:47.204 --> 59:48.861
HE COME TO ME
RAGGED AND HUNGRY.

59:48.895 --> 59:50.310
GAVE HIM A JOB AS
A SPARRING PARTNER.

59:50.345 --> 59:52.727
TOOK HIM OUT OF EASTON,
PENNSYLVANIA,

59:52.761 --> 59:55.108
A LITTLE PEANUT-HEAD,
NOTHING, NO MONEY, BUM.

59:55.143 --> 59:56.938
TAUGHT HIM HOW TO DANCE.

59:56.972 --> 59:58.387
SHOWED HIM HOW TO--YOU SEE HIM
IMITATING ME--SHOWED HIM

59:58.422 --> 1:00:00.286
HOW TO DANCE IN THE RING.

1:00:00.320 --> 1:00:02.115
HE TRIES TO IMITATE ME,
BUT HE GETS TIRED AND CLUMSY.

1:00:02.150 --> 1:00:03.979
HE CAN'T DANCE.

1:00:04.014 --> 1:00:05.705
LISTEN, TRIED TO TEACH
HIM HOW TO TALK.

1:00:05.740 --> 1:00:07.327
HE CAN'T TALK.
DON'T ASK HIM NO QUESTIONS.

1:00:07.362 --> 1:00:08.950
WHY ARE
YOU DOING THIS?

1:00:08.984 --> 1:00:10.123
DO YOU NEED
THE MONEY?

1:00:10.158 --> 1:00:11.918
WHO DON'T NEED MONEY?

1:00:11.953 --> 1:00:14.645
MUHAMMAD ALI NEVER SHOULD'VE
FOUGHT LARRY HOLMES;

1:00:14.680 --> 1:00:16.371
LARRY HOLMES NEVER
SHOULD'VE FOUGHT MUHAMMAD ALI.

1:00:16.405 --> 1:00:18.718
THAT'S THE BUSINESS.

1:00:18.753 --> 1:00:22.101
AND THAT'S ALSO ALI'S
CONSTANT LOOK

1:00:22.135 --> 1:00:25.173
FOR ONE MORE CHANCE
TO GET ON STAGE.

1:00:25.207 --> 1:00:28.417
IN JULY,
DOCTORS AT THE MAYO CLINIC

1:00:28.452 --> 1:00:31.179
GAVE ALI A RIGOROUS
PHYSICAL EXAM.

1:00:31.213 --> 1:00:34.078
THOUGH THEY DETECTED
DIFFICULTY WITH HIS SPEECH,

1:00:34.113 --> 1:00:36.080
MEMORY, AND COORDINATION,

1:00:36.115 --> 1:00:39.049
THEY TOOK HIS WORD THAT HE WAS
JUST "TIRED,"

1:00:39.083 --> 1:00:41.741
AND CLEARED HIM TO FIGHT.

1:00:48.265 --> 1:00:52.683
ALI DYED HIS HAIR
BLACK AND SHED 30 POUNDS.

1:00:52.718 --> 1:00:56.204
HE BEGAN TO LOOK MORE
LIKE HIS OLD SELF.

1:00:56.238 --> 1:00:58.413
BUT WHEN HE INSTRUCTED
HIS SPARRING PARTNERS

1:00:58.447 --> 1:01:02.762
TO PEPPER HIS HEAD WITH PUNCHES,
THEY FOUND IT TOO EASY.

1:01:02.797 --> 1:01:06.317
ANGELO DUNDEE BEGAN SECRETLY
CUTTING THE ROUNDS SHORT

1:01:06.352 --> 1:01:09.355
TO SPARE HIS FIGHTER.

1:01:09.389 --> 1:01:11.322
THREE WEEKS BEFORE THE MATCH,

1:01:11.357 --> 1:01:14.981
HERBERT MUHAMMAD'S PERSONAL
PHYSICIAN GAVE ALI MEDICATION

1:01:15.016 --> 1:01:18.295
TO CORRECT WHAT HE SAID WAS
A THYROID IMBALANCE.

1:01:18.329 --> 1:01:21.298
THE PILLS ACCELERATED
HIS METABOLISM,

1:01:21.332 --> 1:01:23.300
WHICH CAUSED RAPID WEIGHT LOSS,

1:01:23.334 --> 1:01:26.821
AND LEFT HIM FEELING WEAK
AND TIRED.

1:01:26.855 --> 1:01:29.237
DAYS BEFORE THE BOUT,

1:01:29.271 --> 1:01:32.171
ALI COLLAPSED WHILE
ON AN EARLY MORNING RUN

1:01:32.205 --> 1:01:34.863
AND WAS TREATED FOR DEHYDRATION.

1:01:34.898 --> 1:01:39.074
A SPARRING PARTNER WORRIED
THAT ALI WAS UNFIT TO FIGHT,

1:01:39.109 --> 1:01:43.216
BUT HERBERT MUHAMMAD INSISTED
THAT IT WAS TOO LATE TO CANCEL.

1:01:43.251 --> 1:01:46.150
THERE HE IS,
THE RETURNING HERO,

1:01:46.185 --> 1:01:48.359
MAYBE NOT THIS TIME
THE CONQUERING HERO,

1:01:48.394 --> 1:01:50.189
MUHAMMAD ALI...

1:01:50.223 --> 1:01:54.296
ON OCTOBER 2, 1980,
A CROWD OF NEARLY 25,000

1:01:54.331 --> 1:01:57.265
PAID A RECORD-BREAKING
$6 MILLION

1:01:57.299 --> 1:02:02.097
TO FILL A TEMPORARY ARENA
BUILT ALONGSIDE CAESARS PALACE.

1:02:02.132 --> 1:02:04.444
BUT HERE COMES
LARRY HOLMES,

1:02:04.479 --> 1:02:07.413
THE WBC HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION...

1:02:07.447 --> 1:02:09.933
WHAT I FELT THAT I HAD
TO DO IS

1:02:09.967 --> 1:02:13.384
TAKE CONTROL RIGHT OFF THE BAT,

1:02:13.419 --> 1:02:16.353
MAKE HIM RESPECT ME
IN A DIFFERENT SETTING

1:02:16.387 --> 1:02:18.838
THAN HE DID WHILE I
WAS IN THE GYM.

1:02:18.873 --> 1:02:23.394
SO THEREFORE, MY STRATEGY
WAS TO GET TO HIM,

1:02:23.429 --> 1:02:25.086
PUSH HIM AROUND.

1:02:25.120 --> 1:02:26.259
I'M GONNA HANDLE HIM.

1:02:27.433 --> 1:02:29.159
THE BELL FOR ROUND ONE.

1:02:32.024 --> 1:02:35.924
HOLMES REALLY WOULD LIKE TO
MAKE MINCED MEAT OF HIM EARLY

1:02:35.959 --> 1:02:37.443
IF HE CAN.

1:02:37.477 --> 1:02:41.240
25 SECONDS INTO ROUND ONE.

1:02:41.274 --> 1:02:44.864
WITH ALI, YOU MUST CONSTANTLY
LOOK FOR STRATEGY,

1:02:44.899 --> 1:02:47.004
TRYING TO OUTSMART THE OPPONENT.

1:02:47.039 --> 1:02:49.973
AND I THOUGHT,
"OK, IT'S ANOTHER MAGIC TRICK

1:02:50.007 --> 1:02:51.837
HE'S GOING TO SHOW US."

1:02:51.871 --> 1:02:55.841
AND SO, YOU KEPT THINKING--
YOU--ME--KEPT THINKING,

1:02:55.875 --> 1:02:58.257
"ALL RIGHT. HE'S DONE NOTHING
FIRST ROUND.

1:02:58.291 --> 1:03:00.604
"HE'S DONE NOTHING
THE SECOND ROUND.

1:03:00.638 --> 1:03:03.400
ANY MINUTE NOW, HE'S GOING
TO BE MUHAMMAD ALI AGAIN."

1:03:05.402 --> 1:03:08.439
ALI POSTURING AND TALKING,

1:03:08.474 --> 1:03:11.408
BUT NOT PUNCHING,
NOT AT THE MOMENT.

1:03:13.651 --> 1:03:18.518
SEEMS TO ME, THERE IS
A SWELLING TO ALI'S FACE.

1:03:18.553 --> 1:03:22.419
SO FAR, IT IS
UTTERLY NO CONTEST.

1:03:22.453 --> 1:03:24.835
THIRD ROUND, YOU KNOW,

1:03:24.870 --> 1:03:27.320
THEN IT BECAME CLEAR THAT HE
WAS NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING.

1:03:27.355 --> 1:03:30.634
OH, A GOOD LEFT
AND A RIGHT THAT SENT ALI

1:03:30.668 --> 1:03:32.325
BACK AGAINST THE ROPES...

1:03:32.360 --> 1:03:34.258
AND THEN IT WAS
REALLY SAD.

1:03:34.293 --> 1:03:38.090
THEN IT WAS LIKE WATCHING
A TRAIN WRECK,

1:03:38.124 --> 1:03:41.887
LIKE A FRIEND
GET RUN OVER BY A TRUCK.

1:03:41.921 --> 1:03:44.372
ALI GETS WEARILY
TO HIS FEET

1:03:44.406 --> 1:03:47.409
AS WE PREPARE FOR ROUND NINE.

1:03:49.549 --> 1:03:54.244
OH, A GOOD, SHARP LEFT JAB
BY HOLMES.

1:03:54.278 --> 1:03:57.247
THERE IS A FLOW OF BLOOD
UNDER THE LEFT EYE.

1:03:57.281 --> 1:04:01.044
ALI COVERING, AND YET
TWO OF THE LEFTS GOT IN.

1:04:01.078 --> 1:04:06.497
AND I COULD DO PRETTY
MUCH WHAT I WANTED TO DO.

1:04:06.532 --> 1:04:09.673
BUT AS THE ROUNDS END,

1:04:09.707 --> 1:04:16.024
I SAID TO ALI, "DON'T
KEEP TAKIN' THESE PUNCHES.

1:04:16.059 --> 1:04:18.509
DON'T TAKE NO MORE SHOTS."

1:04:18.544 --> 1:04:20.132
HE CUSSED ME OUT.

1:04:20.166 --> 1:04:21.961
HE CALLED ME NAMES
AND EVERYTHING ELSE.

1:04:21.996 --> 1:04:23.376
HE CALLED ME EVERY NAME
IN THE BOOK

1:04:23.411 --> 1:04:25.206
THAT I'D NEVER HEARD HIM
SAY, YOU KNOW?

1:04:25.240 --> 1:04:28.071
OH, THAT RIGHT HURT ALI!

1:04:28.105 --> 1:04:31.143
AND I SAID, "OK,
TAKE THIS. BANG, BANG, BANG."

1:04:31.177 --> 1:04:34.940
OH, HE'S READY TO GO.
THIS MUST BE STOPPED.

1:04:34.974 --> 1:04:37.114
IT IS A SAD WAY TO END.

1:04:37.149 --> 1:04:38.909
YOU START THINKING,
YOU KNOW,

1:04:38.944 --> 1:04:40.359
"I DON'T WANT TO WATCH THIS.

1:04:40.393 --> 1:04:43.362
"I DON'T WANT TO
SEE THIS ANYMORE.

1:04:43.396 --> 1:04:45.053
"I'VE SEEN ALL THE MAGIC.

1:04:45.088 --> 1:04:47.676
THE MAGIC IS GONE NOW,"
YOU KNOW.

1:04:47.711 --> 1:04:52.095
AND SO THAT WAS PROBABLY
AS EMOTIONAL A NIGHT

1:04:52.129 --> 1:04:54.649
AS I'VE EVER SPENT
AS A SPORTSWRITER

1:04:54.683 --> 1:04:57.238
BECAUSE I CARED ABOUT HIM.

1:04:57.272 --> 1:05:00.655
I LIKED HIM. YOU KNOW,
IF HE LOST, THAT WAS ONE THING,

1:05:00.689 --> 1:05:03.209
BUT DON'T GET KILLED IN THERE.

1:05:03.244 --> 1:05:04.728
THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE.

1:05:06.626 --> 1:05:09.422
ALI SLUMPED
ON HIS STOOL AFTER THE TENTH,

1:05:09.457 --> 1:05:12.356
A ROUND IN WHICH HE ATTEMPTED
JUST FOUR FEEBLE PUNCHES.

1:05:12.391 --> 1:05:14.220
OK, IT'S OVER...

1:05:14.255 --> 1:05:16.947
FROM HIS SEAT,
HERBERT MUHAMMAD SIGNALED

1:05:16.982 --> 1:05:20.261
TO ANGELO DUNDEE
TO STOP THE FIGHT.

1:05:20.295 --> 1:05:22.953
HOLMES HAD DOMINATED
EVERY ROUND,

1:05:22.988 --> 1:05:29.477
LANDING 340 PUNCHES TO ALI'S 42.

1:05:29.511 --> 1:05:33.446
WHEN YOU FIGHT A FRIEND--
TO ME, A BROTHER--

1:05:33.481 --> 1:05:36.139
THEN YOU DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.

1:05:36.173 --> 1:05:38.589
YOU CAN'T GET HAPPINESS.

1:05:38.624 --> 1:05:41.765
I TOLD HIM, I SAID, "I LOVE YOU,
AND I REALLY RESPECT YOU."

1:05:41.799 --> 1:05:45.734
I WAS GOING TO MEET MY WIFE,
AND I WAS CRYING.

1:05:45.769 --> 1:05:48.047
AND EVERYBODY SAID,
"WHY YOU CRYING?"

1:05:48.082 --> 1:05:49.497
I SAID,
"BECAUSE I LOVE THIS GUY."

1:05:49.531 --> 1:05:51.533
THE GUY WAS MY MAN."

1:05:51.568 --> 1:05:56.297
AND, SEE,

1:05:56.331 --> 1:05:59.714
THAT PART MADE ME GET--MY EYES
GET WATERED THERE.

1:05:59.748 --> 1:06:01.647
I STILL CRY A LITTLE BIT,

1:06:01.681 --> 1:06:04.477
'CAUSE
THE MAN HAD SO MUCH TO OFFER.

1:06:04.512 --> 1:06:06.479
ALI SAID HE CHECKED
INTO THE HOSPITAL

1:06:06.514 --> 1:06:09.241
BECAUSE HE HADN'T FELT WELL
BEFORE LAST WEEK'S FIGHT,

1:06:09.275 --> 1:06:11.795
AND HE WANTED
TO KNOW WHAT WAS WRONG.

1:06:11.829 --> 1:06:15.385
I WASN'T MYSELF
THE NIGHT I FOUGHT HOLMES.

1:06:15.419 --> 1:06:18.008
I COULDN'T GET AWAY
FROM PUNCHES.

1:06:18.043 --> 1:06:20.286
MY TIMING WAS OFF...

1:06:20.321 --> 1:06:22.185
DOCTORS DETERMINED

1:06:22.219 --> 1:06:24.601
THAT HE HAD OVERDOSED
ON THYROID PILLS,

1:06:24.635 --> 1:06:27.466
BUT FOUND NO EVIDENCE
OF AN UNDERLYING AFFLICTION.

1:06:27.500 --> 1:06:29.330
"HE APPEARS TO BE
IN EXCELLENT HEALTH,"

1:06:29.364 --> 1:06:31.194
REPORTED ONE OF HIS EXAMINERS.

1:06:31.228 --> 1:06:33.713
NOT EVERYONE AGREED.

1:06:33.748 --> 1:06:36.544
"IN TWO OR THREE YEARS, WE'LL
SEE WHAT THE HOLMES FIGHT

1:06:36.578 --> 1:06:38.477
DID TO HIS KIDNEYS AND BRAIN,"

1:06:38.511 --> 1:06:41.238
SAID HIS FORMER FIGHT DOCTOR
FERDIE PACHECO.

1:06:41.273 --> 1:06:43.240
"HE WAS A DAMAGED FIGHTER
BEFORE THE FIGHT,

1:06:43.275 --> 1:06:46.209
AND NOW HE'S GOING TO BE
DAMAGED EVEN MORE."

1:06:46.243 --> 1:06:49.281
HERBERT MUHAMMAD
BLAMED ALI'S VANITY,

1:06:49.315 --> 1:06:53.043
ALLEGING THAT THE BOXER HAD BEEN
TOO CONCERNED WITH LOOKING GOOD.

1:06:53.078 --> 1:06:55.356
"I DON'T THINK HE SHOULD FIGHT
AGAIN," SAID HERBERT,

1:06:55.390 --> 1:06:58.566
"BUT IF HE INSISTS, I'LL TELL
HIM 'I'LL BE WITH YOU.'"

1:06:58.600 --> 1:07:02.673
DON KING CLAIMED HE WOULD ADVISE
ALI AGAINST ANOTHER BOUT,

1:07:02.708 --> 1:07:06.677
BUT ALSO SAID HE
WOULD PROMOTE ONE IF ASKED.

1:07:06.712 --> 1:07:10.509
"I SHALL RETURN," DECLARED ALI.

1:07:10.543 --> 1:07:13.408
I'M ONLY SAYING JUST
BACK IT UP A LITTLE BIT.

1:07:13.443 --> 1:07:15.376
WOULD YOU BACK IT UP A LITTLE
BIT, PLEASE?

1:07:15.410 --> 1:07:17.585
TRUE TO HIS WORD,
THE FOLLOWING YEAR,

1:07:17.619 --> 1:07:20.381
HE FACED 27-YEAR-OLD
TREVOR BERBICK

1:07:20.415 --> 1:07:22.452
IN NASSAU, IN THE BAHAMAS.

1:07:22.486 --> 1:07:24.764
ALI HAD ADVERTISED THE BOUT

1:07:24.799 --> 1:07:27.112
AS THE FIRST IN A SERIES OF
FIGHTS

1:07:27.146 --> 1:07:29.459
TO REGAIN THE HEAVYWEIGHT CROWN.

1:07:29.493 --> 1:07:31.150
I'VE GOT A CHANCE
TO GO DOWN

1:07:31.185 --> 1:07:34.567
AS THE GREATEST ATHLETE,
NOT BOXER, IN HISTORY.

1:07:34.602 --> 1:07:37.708
I CAN MAKE SO MANY PEOPLE WRONG.

1:07:37.743 --> 1:07:40.435
SO MANY OF THE WRITERS
WILL HAVE TO EAT CROW.

1:07:40.470 --> 1:07:43.266
I HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE TO BEAT,
NOT JUST BERBICK.

1:07:43.300 --> 1:07:46.338
SO I DON'T HAVE NO EXTRA TIME
TO CLOWN FOR YOU.

1:07:46.372 --> 1:07:51.205
ALMOST 40 YEARS OLD,
HE WEIGHED 236 POUNDS,

1:07:51.239 --> 1:07:54.139
NEARLY 20 MORE
THAN WHEN HE FOUGHT HOLMES.

1:07:54.173 --> 1:07:55.657
AND IN THE DAYS BEFORE
THE FIGHT,

1:07:55.692 --> 1:07:58.902
HE HAD STRUGGLED TO COMPLETE
HIS MORNING RUNS.

1:07:58.936 --> 1:08:00.248
BERBICK'S ALL OVER

1:08:00.283 --> 1:08:01.663
ALI ON THE ROPES.

1:08:01.698 --> 1:08:03.631
TWO OF THOSE RIGHT HANDS...

1:08:03.665 --> 1:08:04.908
IT WAS

1:08:04.942 --> 1:08:07.255
A HORRIBLE FIGHT.

1:08:07.290 --> 1:08:11.639
WE WERE JUST CRINGING
IN THE STANDS, JUST,

1:08:11.673 --> 1:08:13.710
"DADDY, PLEASE, JUST THROW
THE TOWEL IN."

1:08:13.744 --> 1:08:16.437
WE DIDN'T WANT TO
WATCH HIM ANYMORE.

1:08:16.471 --> 1:08:20.475
ALI WAS REALLY HURT
THAT TIME. HE'S WINCING.

1:08:20.510 --> 1:08:22.684
IT WAS VERY HARD
TO WATCH.

1:08:22.719 --> 1:08:24.893
THOUGH ALI LASTED
ALL TEN ROUNDS,

1:08:24.928 --> 1:08:27.379
THE DECISION WAS UNANIMOUS.

1:08:27.413 --> 1:08:29.277
BERBICK'S LANDING
SOME GOOD PUNCHES

1:08:29.312 --> 1:08:31.417
WHILE ALI TRIES TO HOLD ON.

1:08:31.452 --> 1:08:33.626
THERE IT IS.

1:08:33.661 --> 1:08:36.733
TREVOR BERBICK
IS THE UNANIMOUS DECISION...

1:08:36.767 --> 1:08:39.943
RASHEDA JOINED ALI
IN HIS DRESSING ROOM

1:08:39.977 --> 1:08:41.841
AFTER THE FIGHT.

1:08:41.876 --> 1:08:45.190
"I WANTED HIM TO LOSE,"
HER SISTER MARYUM SAID LATER.

1:08:45.224 --> 1:08:48.227
"IF HE WON, HE'D KEEP FIGHTING,

1:08:48.262 --> 1:08:50.678
AND I DIDN'T WANT
HIM TO FIGHT ANYMORE."

1:08:50.712 --> 1:08:52.404
HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW?

1:08:52.438 --> 1:08:53.957
DO YOU THINK
IT'S TIME NOW,

1:08:53.991 --> 1:08:56.511
THAT YOU SHOULD GIVE SOME
SERIOUS THOUGHT TO THIS?

1:08:56.546 --> 1:09:00.412
I FELT MORE LIKE RETIRING
A MINUTE AFTER THE FIGHT.

1:09:00.446 --> 1:09:03.173
PROBABLY NEXT WEEK,
I'LL BE TRYING AGAIN.

1:09:03.208 --> 1:09:06.211
I THINK I'LL QUIT.
FATHER TIME CAUGHT ME.

1:09:06.245 --> 1:09:07.695
YOU THINK
FATHER TIME CAUGHT YOU?

1:09:07.729 --> 1:09:09.214
YOU THINK MAYBE NEXT WEEK,
YOU'LL THINK ABOUT IT,

1:09:09.248 --> 1:09:10.905
BUT NOW YOU'RE...

1:09:10.939 --> 1:09:12.769
I THINK
FATHER TIME WINS.

1:09:16.773 --> 1:09:19.431
HIS CAREER WAS OVER.

1:09:19.465 --> 1:09:21.985
MUHAMMAD ALI HAD CAPTURED
THE GOLD MEDAL

1:09:22.019 --> 1:09:24.677
AT THE ROME OLYMPICS IN 1960.

1:09:24.712 --> 1:09:28.854
HE HAD WON 56 PROFESSIONAL
FIGHTS, LOST JUST FIVE

1:09:28.888 --> 1:09:34.549
TO JOE FRAZIER, KEN NORTON,
LEON SPINKS, LARRY HOLMES,

1:09:34.584 --> 1:09:36.586
AND TREVOR BERBICK,

1:09:36.620 --> 1:09:40.935
AND HAD WON THE HEAVYWEIGHT
CHAMPIONSHIP THREE TIMES.

1:09:40.969 --> 1:09:44.835
HIS FIGHTS HAD EARNED HIM
MORE THAN $50 MILLION,

1:09:44.870 --> 1:09:48.839
MORE THAN ALL THE PREVIOUS
HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONS COMBINED.

1:09:48.874 --> 1:09:51.532
BILLIONS OF FANS ACROSS
THE WORLD HAD WATCHED HIM

1:09:51.566 --> 1:09:56.502
FIGHT IN PERSON, IN
MOVIE HOUSES, AND ON TELEVISION.

1:09:56.537 --> 1:09:59.333
AND HE HAD ABSORBED
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PUNCHES

1:09:59.367 --> 1:10:02.508
TO HIS BODY AND HEAD.

1:10:02.543 --> 1:10:04.372
HE SHOULD HAVE QUIT,

1:10:04.407 --> 1:10:06.512
SHOULD HAVE QUIT AFTER BEATING
FOREMAN IN ZAIRE.

1:10:06.547 --> 1:10:08.549
THAT'S WHEN THE MOVIE ENDS.

1:10:08.583 --> 1:10:11.448
IT CAN'T GET BETTER
THAN THIS, YOU KNOW.

1:10:11.483 --> 1:10:14.762
BUT THE ATTENTION IS A DRUG,
TOO, YOU KNOW.

1:10:14.796 --> 1:10:16.902
THE ADRENALINE IS A DRUG, TOO,
YOU KNOW.

1:10:16.936 --> 1:10:19.318
THE CELEBRITY IS A DRUG, TOO.

1:10:19.353 --> 1:10:20.526
HE COULDN'T RESIST THAT.

1:10:24.806 --> 1:10:28.948
IN NOVEMBER OF 1982,
MUHAMMAD ALI RETURNED TO THE GYM

1:10:28.983 --> 1:10:31.572
TO TRAIN FOR A 3-WEEK
EXHIBITION TOUR

1:10:31.606 --> 1:10:35.403
WITH STOPS IN SAUDI ARABIA,
INDIA, AND PAKISTAN.

1:10:35.438 --> 1:10:37.716
THE PROFITS WOULD GO TOWARDS
THE CONSTRUCTION

1:10:37.750 --> 1:10:39.994
OF A NEW MOSQUE IN CHICAGO.

1:10:40.028 --> 1:10:43.342
"MY LIFE IS JUST STARTING AT
40," HE SAID.

1:10:43.377 --> 1:10:46.621
"I'M DOING THIS FOR
THE MOSLEMIC RELIGION."

1:10:46.656 --> 1:10:51.454
SINCE RETIRING FROM BOXING,
ALI'S CONDITION HAD WORSENED.

1:10:51.488 --> 1:10:56.700
OVERWEIGHT AND OFTEN FATIGUED,
HE SPOKE SOFTLY AND HESITANTLY,

1:10:56.735 --> 1:10:58.806
AND SHUFFLED WHEN HE WALKED.

1:10:58.840 --> 1:11:02.534
I PROBABLY WAS
FIVE YEARS OLD, AND I REMEMBER

1:11:02.568 --> 1:11:05.675
JUST HIM STUMBLING WHEN HE
WALKED OR LOSING HIS BALANCE,

1:11:05.709 --> 1:11:07.918
OR THIS GLAZE IN HIS EYE.

1:11:07.953 --> 1:11:09.713
I REMEMBER ONCE HE WAS PULLED
OVER BY A POLICE OFFICER,

1:11:09.748 --> 1:11:10.852
AND THEY WANTED--
THEY THOUGHT HE WAS DRUNK,

1:11:10.887 --> 1:11:12.371
AND MY FATHER DIDN'T DRINK.

1:11:12.406 --> 1:11:14.511
AND HE COULDN'T WALK THE LINE.

1:11:14.546 --> 1:11:16.513
AND THEY REALIZED,
"OH, HE'S NOT DRUNK.

1:11:16.548 --> 1:11:18.722
"THIS IS, YOU KNOW,
MUHAMMAD ALI, AND, YOU KNOW,

1:11:18.757 --> 1:11:20.414
SOMETHING WASN'T RIGHT."

1:11:20.448 --> 1:11:22.933
BUT HE HAD PARKINSON'S,
AND NO ONE KNEW.

1:11:22.968 --> 1:11:25.764
THE CORNERMEN AND CONFIDANTS,

1:11:25.798 --> 1:11:27.904
FACILITATORS AND HANGERS-ON

1:11:27.938 --> 1:11:30.355
WHO HAD TRAVELED THE GLOBE
WITH ALI, READYING HIM

1:11:30.389 --> 1:11:33.047
FOR EACH FIGHT AND REVELING
IN HIS ADVENTURES,

1:11:33.081 --> 1:11:35.670
HAD LARGELY MOVED ON.

1:11:35.705 --> 1:11:39.122
BUNDINI BROWN,
WHO SUFFERED FROM DIABETES

1:11:39.156 --> 1:11:41.124
AND WAS DRINKING EXCESSIVELY,

1:11:41.158 --> 1:11:44.817
NOW LIVED IN A SHABBY MOTEL
IN LOS ANGELES.

1:11:44.852 --> 1:11:47.993
WHEN BUNDINI WAS PARALYZED
IN A FALL,

1:11:48.027 --> 1:11:53.412
ALI VISITED HIS FRIEND AT
GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL.

1:11:53.447 --> 1:11:55.794
MUHAMMAD AND I ENTERED,
AND WE WALKED IN,

1:11:55.828 --> 1:11:57.589
AND MUHAMMAD,
I KNEW HE WANTED TO CRY,

1:11:57.623 --> 1:12:00.557
BUT THEN HE JUST
GRABBED HIS LIPS,

1:12:00.592 --> 1:12:03.077
"HEY, DREW, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1:12:03.111 --> 1:12:05.424
"YOU'RE GOING TO BE
SO HAPPY AND EVERYTHING.

1:12:05.459 --> 1:12:09.083
NO MORE SICKNESS, NO MORE--
NO MORE TRIALS," HE GOES.

1:12:09.117 --> 1:12:10.947
THEN HE WENT, "HEY, DREW."

1:12:10.981 --> 1:12:13.915
HE WENT, "FLOAT LIKE
A BUTTERFLY, STING LIKE A BEE.

1:12:13.950 --> 1:12:17.954
RUMBLE, YOUNG MAN, RUMBLE, HA!"

1:12:17.988 --> 1:12:21.751
AND THEN DREW STARTED SHAKING
AND STARTED CRYING EVEN MORE,

1:12:21.785 --> 1:12:24.512
AND THEN HE BENT DOWN,
AND HE KISSED HIM,

1:12:24.547 --> 1:12:28.447
AND MUHAMMAD JUST HELD HIS HAND,
AND MUHAMMAD WAS--

1:12:28.482 --> 1:12:30.725
FINALLY, TEARS CAME DOWN
HIS EYES,

1:12:30.760 --> 1:12:35.143
AND THEN WE LEFT.

1:12:35.178 --> 1:12:38.181
DAYS LATER,
BROWN WAS DEAD.

1:12:38.215 --> 1:12:40.114
HE WAS 59 YEARS OLD.

1:12:43.117 --> 1:12:47.673
IN SEPTEMBER OF 1984, ALI
CHECKED HIMSELF INTO NEW YORK'S

1:12:47.708 --> 1:12:50.124
COLUMBIA-PRESBYTERIAN
MEDICAL CENTER.

1:12:50.158 --> 1:12:52.816
AFTER DAYS OF TESTS,
DOCTORS SAID

1:12:52.851 --> 1:12:55.992
HE HAD PARKINSON'S SYNDROME.

1:12:56.026 --> 1:12:57.821
WHEN MY DAD WAS
FIRST DIAGNOSED

1:12:57.856 --> 1:13:02.895
WITH PARKINSON'S, HE WAS
SHOCKED LIKE ANYBODY WOULD BE.

1:13:02.930 --> 1:13:05.415
"THERE'S NO CURE?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?"

1:13:05.450 --> 1:13:09.557
AND MY DAD LOVED THE CAMERA.

1:13:09.592 --> 1:13:13.043
HE LOVED TALKING.
HE LOVED CLOWNING AROUND.

1:13:13.078 --> 1:13:15.529
HE LOVED BEING MUHAMMAD ALI.

1:13:15.563 --> 1:13:20.568
BUT WHEN PARKINSON'S ROBBED HIM,
OR TRIED TO ROB HIM,

1:13:20.603 --> 1:13:24.641
OF HIS SPEECH AND HIS WAY
THAT HE WOULD COMMUNICATE

1:13:24.676 --> 1:13:27.023
WITH PEOPLE, HE WAS TAKEN ABACK.

1:13:27.057 --> 1:13:30.475
AT THE HOUSE
ON FREMONT PLACE,

1:13:30.509 --> 1:13:34.720
FRIENDS, CELEBRITIES,
AND FANS CONTINUED TO DROP BY,

1:13:34.755 --> 1:13:38.241
BUT ALI AND VERONICA
WERE GROWING APART.

1:13:38.275 --> 1:13:41.451
HE HAD BEEN CHEATING
ON HER FOR YEARS.

1:13:41.486 --> 1:13:44.454
IT WAS VERY, VERY,
VERY PAINFUL,

1:13:44.489 --> 1:13:46.145
ESPECIALLY IN THE BEGINNING.

1:13:46.180 --> 1:13:47.802
I THOUGHT I'D DIE.

1:13:47.837 --> 1:13:54.015
AND AFTER A WHILE,
I BECAME NUMB.

1:13:56.259 --> 1:13:59.642
TWO YEARS EARLIER,
WHILE ON A TRIP TO LOUISVILLE,

1:13:59.676 --> 1:14:02.852
ALI HAD INVITED LONNIE WILLIAMS
TO JOIN HIM FOR LUNCH.

1:14:05.889 --> 1:14:08.789
THE TWO HAD FIRST MET
IN THE EARLY 1960s,

1:14:08.823 --> 1:14:11.861
WHEN LONNIE WAS
IN THE FIRST GRADE.

1:14:11.895 --> 1:14:15.554
WE MOVED IN NOT KNOWING
WHO LIVED ACROSS THE STREET.

1:14:15.589 --> 1:14:18.557
NOW, ACTUALLY MUHAMMAD DIDN'T
LIVE THERE, JUST HIS PARENTS.

1:14:18.592 --> 1:14:20.248
AND IT WAS SHORTLY AFTER
WE MOVED IN

1:14:20.283 --> 1:14:23.528
THAT WE FIRST MET HIM,

1:14:23.562 --> 1:14:26.600
AND WE REALIZED, YOU KNOW,
THAT, "OH, YOU KNOW,

1:14:26.634 --> 1:14:30.120
THERE'S SOMEBODY FAMOUS
ACROSS THE STREET HERE."

1:14:30.155 --> 1:14:32.226
THEIR MOTHERS
HAD BECOME CLOSE,

1:14:32.260 --> 1:14:34.124
AND, OVER THE YEARS,

1:14:34.159 --> 1:14:38.128
ALI HAD SEEN LONNIE
WHEN VISITING LOUISVILLE.

1:14:38.163 --> 1:14:42.167
NOW LONNIE WAS
TROUBLED BY ALI'S CLUMSY GAIT

1:14:42.201 --> 1:14:44.549
AND MUMBLED SPEECH.

1:14:44.583 --> 1:14:47.966
SOON, SHE RELOCATED
TO LOS ANGELES.

1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:52.626
BEFORE LONG,
ALI WAS SEEING LONNIE REGULARLY.

1:14:52.660 --> 1:14:58.183
IN 1985, VERONICA TOLD
MUHAMMAD SHE WANTED A DIVORCE.

1:14:58.217 --> 1:15:01.255
IT WASN'T
AS IF I WAS ANGRY WITH HIM.

1:15:01.289 --> 1:15:03.706
I JUST COULDN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

1:15:03.740 --> 1:15:08.262
WE WERE VERY CIVIL AND FRIENDLY.

1:15:08.296 --> 1:15:11.783
HE WAS HOPING THAT
I WOULD CHANGE MY MIND.

1:15:11.817 --> 1:15:15.649
BUT I THINK HE WOULD
HAVE BEEN JUST AS NICE

1:15:15.683 --> 1:15:19.342
EVEN IF HE HAD ACCEPTED IT
ALREADY.

1:15:19.376 --> 1:15:22.069
THAT'S JUST THE WAY HE WAS.

1:15:22.103 --> 1:15:25.590
ON NOVEMBER 19, 1986,

1:15:25.624 --> 1:15:27.902
MUHAMMAD ALI MARRIED
LONNIE WILLIAMS

1:15:27.937 --> 1:15:31.078
BEFORE A HANDFUL OF FRIENDS
AND FAMILY IN LOUISVILLE.

1:15:31.112 --> 1:15:36.635
SEEKING QUIET, THE NEWLYWEDS
MOVED TO ALI'S FARM IN MICHIGAN.

1:15:36.670 --> 1:15:41.053
FOR DECADES, ALI HAD SHARED
HIS INCOME FREELY WITH FAMILY,

1:15:41.088 --> 1:15:43.021
FRIENDS, AND STRANGERS,

1:15:43.055 --> 1:15:44.643
AND HAD GOTTEN INVOLVED

1:15:44.678 --> 1:15:47.025
IN COUNTLESS
DUBIOUS BUSINESS VENTURES.

1:15:47.059 --> 1:15:50.994
LONNIE BROUGHT ORDER
TO ALI'S FINANCES.

1:15:51.029 --> 1:15:52.375
SHE NOT ONLY
TOOK CARE OF HIM

1:15:52.409 --> 1:15:54.170
AND SHE NOT ONLY, YOU KNOW,
LOVED HIM

1:15:54.204 --> 1:15:56.241
AND STARTED A NEW FAMILY
WITH HIM,

1:15:56.275 --> 1:15:59.071
SHE BECAME, REALLY,
THE C.E.O. OF ALI, INC.,

1:15:59.106 --> 1:16:01.073
AND GOT RID OF A LOT OF
THE PEOPLE

1:16:01.108 --> 1:16:03.041
WHO'D BEEN LEECHING MONEY,

1:16:03.075 --> 1:16:04.801
GOT RID OF A LOT OF
THE BAD BUSINESSES

1:16:04.836 --> 1:16:06.665
THAT HE'D BEEN A PART OF,

1:16:06.700 --> 1:16:10.358
AND, STARTED TO FIND WAYS
THAT THEY COULD MAKE MONEY

1:16:10.393 --> 1:16:12.050
IN HIS POST-BOXING CAREER.

1:16:14.949 --> 1:16:16.951
HIS DEVOTION TO ISLAM

1:16:16.986 --> 1:16:19.747
INCREASINGLY SHAPED
HIS DAILY ROUTINE.

1:16:19.782 --> 1:16:23.406
HE PRAYED FIVE TIMES EACH DAY
FACING MECCA,

1:16:23.440 --> 1:16:27.341
CALLED FRIENDS TO DISCUSS THE
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RELIGIONS,

1:16:27.375 --> 1:16:30.896
AND DISTRIBUTED AUTOGRAPHED
PAMPHLETS THAT HE HOPED

1:16:30.931 --> 1:16:35.245
WOULD HELP CORRECT COMMON
MISPERCEPTIONS ABOUT HIS FAITH.

1:16:37.420 --> 1:16:39.180
WHEN HE TRAVELED
IN THE MUSLIM WORLD,

1:16:39.215 --> 1:16:43.046
MASSIVE CROWDS GREETED HIM
AS "MUHAMMAD ALI CLAY"

1:16:43.081 --> 1:16:46.705
TO DISTINGUISH THEIR HERO FROM
THOUSANDS OF FAITHFUL MUSLIMS

1:16:46.740 --> 1:16:50.433
ALSO NAMED MUHAMMAD ALI.

1:16:50.467 --> 1:16:54.817
DURING A GOODWILL VISIT
TO PAKISTAN IN 1987,

1:16:54.851 --> 1:16:59.407
MUHAMMAD AND LONNIE VISITED
SCHOOLS, HOSPITALS, AND MOSQUES.

1:16:59.442 --> 1:17:03.170
THEY DELIVERED CANNED MILK
TO AN AFGHAN REFUGEE CAMP

1:17:03.204 --> 1:17:04.723
ALONG THE BORDER

1:17:04.758 --> 1:17:07.174
AND ENCOURAGED
GUERRILLA FIGHTERS THERE

1:17:07.208 --> 1:17:10.418
IN THEIR LONG STRUGGLE TO EVICT
THE OCCUPYING SOVIET ARMY

1:17:10.453 --> 1:17:12.973
FROM AFGHANISTAN.

1:17:13.007 --> 1:17:15.458
HE NEEDED LOVE
LIKE HE NEEDED AIR TO BREATHE.

1:17:15.492 --> 1:17:18.081
SO THE PEOPLE DID PROBABLY
MORE FOR HIM

1:17:18.116 --> 1:17:20.739
THAN HE DID FOR THEM,
IF NOT AT LEAST EQUAL, YOU KNOW?

1:17:20.774 --> 1:17:22.430
SO HE WAS SO GRATEFUL
FOR THE LOVE THEY GAVE,

1:17:22.465 --> 1:17:24.191
HE WAS SO GRATEFUL FOR THAT.

1:17:24.225 --> 1:17:28.057
IN 1989, HE WAS ON THE ROAD

1:17:28.091 --> 1:17:31.957
MORE THAN AT HOME, VISITING
ENGLAND, SENEGAL, SWITZERLAND,

1:17:31.992 --> 1:17:34.063
AND SAUDI ARABIA.

1:17:34.097 --> 1:17:37.722
IN APRIL, HE AND LONNIE
MADE A PILGRIMAGE TO MECCA

1:17:37.756 --> 1:17:40.172
DURING THE HOLY MONTH
OF RAMADAN.

1:17:40.207 --> 1:17:44.142
ALI HAD VISITED MECCA
BEFORE, IN 1972,

1:17:44.176 --> 1:17:46.178
BUT NOW ADMITTED THAT HE

1:17:46.213 --> 1:17:49.250
HADN'T FULLY APPRECIATED
ITS SIGNIFICANCE

1:17:49.285 --> 1:17:51.943
AND ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HIS
COMMITMENT TO HIS RELIGION

1:17:51.977 --> 1:17:54.324
HAD LONG BEEN IMPERFECT.

1:17:54.359 --> 1:17:57.880
"I FIT MY RELIGION TO
DO WHATEVER I WANTED.

1:17:57.914 --> 1:18:02.056
"I DID THINGS THAT WERE WRONG,
AND CHASED WOMEN ALL THE TIME.

1:18:02.091 --> 1:18:07.372
EVERYTHING I DO NOW
I DO TO PLEASE ALLAH."

1:18:07.406 --> 1:18:09.201
ONE OF MY FATHER'S FAVORITE
SAYINGS WAS,

1:18:09.236 --> 1:18:10.962
"RIVERS, LAKES, AND STREAMS
ALL HAVE DIFFERENT NAMES,

1:18:10.996 --> 1:18:12.722
"BUT THEY ALL CONTAIN WATER.

1:18:12.757 --> 1:18:14.862
"SO DO RELIGIONS HAVE
DIFFERENT NAMES,

1:18:14.897 --> 1:18:17.209
BUT THEY ALL CONTAIN TRUTH."

1:18:17.244 --> 1:18:19.522
HE ALWAYS TAUGHT ME THAT
THERE'S ONLY ONE TRUE RELIGION,

1:18:19.556 --> 1:18:21.904
AND THAT'S THE RELIGION OF
THE HEART, HE WOULD SAY.

1:18:21.938 --> 1:18:23.906
"AND AS LONG AS YOU DO RIGHT
AND YOU TREAT PEOPLE RIGHT,

1:18:23.940 --> 1:18:25.390
"I BELIEVE YOU'LL GO TO HEAVEN

1:18:25.424 --> 1:18:27.323
NO MATTER WHAT YOU CALL
YOUR RELIGION."

1:18:27.357 --> 1:18:29.049
AS HIS
SYMPTOMS PROGRESSED--

1:18:29.083 --> 1:18:32.121
HIS SPEECH MORE SLURRED,
HIS TREMORS MORE OBVIOUS,

1:18:32.155 --> 1:18:35.124
HIS ONCE EXPRESSIVE FACE
NOW FROZEN--

1:18:35.158 --> 1:18:38.403
ALI SPOKE OF HIS PARKINSON'S
AS A TRIAL FROM GOD

1:18:38.437 --> 1:18:40.923
AND A PUNISHMENT FOR HIS SINS,

1:18:40.957 --> 1:18:43.788
BUT ALSO AS A BLESSING
THAT KEPT HIM HUMBLE.

1:18:43.822 --> 1:18:45.410
MUHAMMAD, GOOD MORNING.

1:18:45.444 --> 1:18:47.032
THANKS. GOOD MORNING.

1:18:47.067 --> 1:18:48.309
HOW YOU BEEN?

1:18:48.344 --> 1:18:49.966
TIRED, TRAVELING...

1:18:50.001 --> 1:18:51.761
HE HAD ONCE
LOVED TO ADMIRE

1:18:51.796 --> 1:18:54.419
HIS OWN REFLECTION
AND CROW ABOUT HIS GOOD LOOKS.

1:18:54.453 --> 1:18:57.802
BUT WHEN HE SAW A RECORDING
OF HIMSELF ON THE "TODAY SHOW,"

1:18:57.836 --> 1:18:59.942
ALI RECOILED.

1:18:59.976 --> 1:19:02.807
"THAT MAN LOOKED LIKE
HE'S DYING," HE SAID.

1:19:05.395 --> 1:19:08.157
IN 1996,
ALI TRAVELED TO CUBA

1:19:08.191 --> 1:19:12.023
ON A HUMANITARIAN MISSION,
VISITING CHILDREN'S WARDS

1:19:12.057 --> 1:19:14.577
AND DELIVERING MEDICAL SUPPLIES.

1:19:14.611 --> 1:19:18.132
ALI AND HIS COMPANIONS
ATTENDED A RECEPTION

1:19:18.167 --> 1:19:19.962
WITH FIDEL CASTRO.

1:19:22.102 --> 1:19:23.828
UNABLE TO SPEAK,

1:19:23.862 --> 1:19:25.381
ALI ENTERTAINED
THE CUBAN PRESIDENT

1:19:25.415 --> 1:19:28.177
AND HIS GUESTS,
PERFORMING MAGIC TRICKS.

1:19:28.211 --> 1:19:32.491
AFTERWARDS, BELIEVING THAT
IT WENT AGAINST ISLAM

1:19:32.526 --> 1:19:37.082
TO DECEIVE PEOPLE, HE REVEALED
THE SECRET TO EACH TRICK.

1:19:44.020 --> 1:19:46.298
HE'D BEEN FORGOTTEN
TO SOME EXTENT.

1:19:46.333 --> 1:19:47.921
I THINK PEOPLE
DON'T APPRECIATE THAT,

1:19:47.955 --> 1:19:50.337
IN THE LATE EIGHTIES,
EARLY NINETIES,

1:19:50.371 --> 1:19:53.271
ALI DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH ATTENTION
TO MAKE HIM HAPPY.

1:19:53.305 --> 1:19:57.206
HE'D GO OUT AND DO EVENTS
FOR $1,000, $2,000.

1:19:57.240 --> 1:19:59.139
HE'D SIT ALL DAY
SIGNING AUTOGRAPHS

1:19:59.173 --> 1:20:02.038
AT A TRADE SHOW,
AND HE WOULDN'T LEAVE

1:20:02.073 --> 1:20:05.076
WHEN HIS TIME WAS UP UNTIL
EVERYBODY GOT THEIR AUTOGRAPHS

1:20:05.110 --> 1:20:07.043
BECAUSE HE WANTED TO MAKE
PEOPLE HAPPY

1:20:07.078 --> 1:20:09.632
AND HE WANTED THE ATTENTION.

1:20:09.666 --> 1:20:12.911
IN 1996,
THE OLYMPIC COMMITTEE,

1:20:12.946 --> 1:20:16.190
PLANNING THE SUMMER GAMES
IN ATLANTA, ASKED MUHAMMAD ALI

1:20:16.225 --> 1:20:19.193
TO LIGHT THE TORCH
AT THE OPENING CEREMONIES.

1:20:19.228 --> 1:20:21.955
AT FIRST, ALI DECLINED.

1:20:21.989 --> 1:20:23.957
HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE SEEN
SHAKING

1:20:23.991 --> 1:20:26.097
AND STUMBLING ON THAT STAGE.

1:20:26.131 --> 1:20:29.410
BUT HIS FRIEND HOWARD BINGHAM
CONVINCED HIM.

1:20:29.445 --> 1:20:33.069
"THIS IS THE THING WHERE
THE WORLD IS SAYING, 'THANK YOU

1:20:33.104 --> 1:20:36.348
FOR ALL THAT YOU'VE DONE OVER
YOUR LIFE,'" BINGHAM TOLD HIM.

1:20:36.383 --> 1:20:38.972
"THERE WILL BE
3 BILLION PEOPLE WATCHING."

1:20:46.289 --> 1:20:48.913
THE PLANS WERE KEPT SECRET.

1:20:48.947 --> 1:20:50.431
DO YOU RECOGNIZE HER?

1:20:50.466 --> 1:20:53.676
JANET EVANS.

1:20:53.710 --> 1:20:56.161
CONSIDERED THE
GREATEST FEMALE DISTANCE SWIMMER

1:20:56.196 --> 1:20:57.542
OF ALL TIME.

1:20:57.576 --> 1:21:00.131
AND IT WAS
PLANNED VERY BRILLIANTLY.

1:21:00.165 --> 1:21:03.272
I MEAN, PEOPLE REALLY THOUGHT
THE SWIMMER JANET EVANS WAS

1:21:03.306 --> 1:21:06.654
GOING TO BE THE PERSON WHO
WAS GOING TO LIGHT THAT TORCH,

1:21:06.689 --> 1:21:09.588
BUT INSTEAD OUT OF
NOWHERE COMES MUHAMMAD ALI.

1:21:20.220 --> 1:21:21.359
NAOMI SHELTON & THE GOSPEL

1:21:23.188 --> 1:21:24.983
YOU HADN'T REALLY SEEN HIM
IN A WHILE.

1:21:25.018 --> 1:21:27.537
YOU KNEW HE WAS SICK,
AND WHEN YOU WOULD SEE HIM,

1:21:27.572 --> 1:21:31.369
HE WAS CLEARLY SHOWING
THE EFFECTS OF THE ILLNESS,

1:21:31.403 --> 1:21:33.716
BUT HE HADN'T BEEN SEEN
THAT MUCH,

1:21:33.750 --> 1:21:36.926
AND THEN HERE HE IS IN THIS BIG,
PROMINENT MOMENT.

1:21:36.961 --> 1:21:40.481
AND HE'S HOLDING THAT TORCH,
AND HE'S SHAKING.

1:21:40.516 --> 1:21:45.210
AND, I, MAN,
I'M ABOUT TO CRY NOW.

1:21:45.245 --> 1:21:48.524
IT WAS HARD TO WATCH BECAUSE YOU

1:21:48.558 --> 1:21:52.217
DON'T WANT TO SEE YOUR GUY
LIKE THAT.

1:21:52.252 --> 1:21:57.050
YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT,
BUT YOU--YOU SAW IT.

1:21:57.084 --> 1:22:00.260
HE WAS DEFENSELESS NOW.

1:22:00.294 --> 1:22:03.263
HE CAN'T HURT US ANYMORE,
YOU KNOW.

1:22:03.297 --> 1:22:09.510
HE CAN'T MAKE US MAD ANYMORE,
BECAUSE NOW HE'S...

1:22:09.545 --> 1:22:14.308
THE GAME THAT WE ASKED HIM TO
PLAY TO ENTERTAIN US

1:22:14.343 --> 1:22:17.001
HAS LEFT HIM LOOKING LIKE THIS.

1:22:17.035 --> 1:22:21.488
AND NOW WE FEEL SOME SYMPATHY,
IF NOT GUILT.

1:22:21.522 --> 1:22:26.976
WE SEE HIM SHAKING,
TREMBLING UP THERE.

1:22:27.011 --> 1:22:28.702
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL, MOVING--

1:22:28.736 --> 1:22:31.498
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ATHLETE
IN MOTION YOU'VE EVER SEEN,

1:22:31.532 --> 1:22:35.260
AND NOW HE CAN'T HOLD
THE TORCH, YOU KNOW.

1:22:35.295 --> 1:22:37.745
SO, WE FEEL GUILT,
AND WE FEEL SYMPATHY.

1:22:37.780 --> 1:22:39.402
WE WANT TO HUG HIM.
WE WANT TO EMBRACE HIM.

1:22:39.437 --> 1:22:42.405
WE WANT TO ASK HIS
FORGIVENESS, YOU KNOW.

1:22:42.440 --> 1:22:46.375
FOR EVERY REASON THAT WE
DISLIKED HIM,

1:22:46.409 --> 1:22:51.207
NOW WE LOVE HIM, YOU KNOW,
BECAUSE HE WAS RIGHT.

1:22:59.422 --> 1:23:03.012
IT WAS STRIKING TO SEE
THIS EVOLUTION

1:23:03.047 --> 1:23:07.465
NOT IN ALI, BUT IN US.

1:23:07.499 --> 1:23:12.366
IT JUST STRUCK ME SO AMAZINGLY
TO WATCH ALI,

1:23:12.401 --> 1:23:14.679
LIKE, LIGHTING THIS TORCH,

1:23:14.713 --> 1:23:18.027
PEOPLE WEEPING.

1:23:18.062 --> 1:23:22.445
IT'S AMAZING, AND YOU--
AND YOU CAST BACK

1:23:22.480 --> 1:23:24.758
NOT SO MANY YEARS BEFORE,

1:23:24.792 --> 1:23:27.761
AND SOME HUGE AMOUNT OF
THE COUNTRY THOUGHT

1:23:27.795 --> 1:23:31.178
THIS GUY WAS THE ANTICHRIST,

1:23:31.213 --> 1:23:32.524
OR THEY CHOSE TO HATE HIM,

1:23:32.559 --> 1:23:34.423
OR THEY MADE HIM A FOIL

1:23:34.457 --> 1:23:36.804
TO THE OTHER GUY
THAT THEY LIKED BETTER.

1:23:36.839 --> 1:23:40.394
AND IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE
THAT HUMAN BEINGS

1:23:40.429 --> 1:23:41.809
ARE CAPABLE OF
LEARNING SOMETHING.

1:23:44.847 --> 1:23:48.782
THE OUTPOURING OF LOVE
CAUGHT ALI BY SURPRISE.

1:23:48.816 --> 1:23:51.095
"PARKINSON'S ROBS YOU OF
CONFIDENCE,"

1:23:51.129 --> 1:23:53.304
LONNIE TOLD A REPORTER.

1:23:53.338 --> 1:23:56.065
"NOW HE KNOWS THE PUBLIC
WILL LOVE HIM AND ACCEPT HIM

1:23:56.100 --> 1:23:57.791
NO MATTER WHAT HE HAS."

1:23:57.825 --> 1:24:04.867
NAOMI SHELTON &

1:24:04.901 --> 1:24:08.077
ALI, LATE IN LIFE,
TALKED ABOUT

1:24:08.112 --> 1:24:10.459
THIS TALLYING ANGEL,
HE CALLED IT,

1:24:10.493 --> 1:24:12.633
THAT THERE WAS AN ANGEL UP THERE
WHO COUNTED ALL THE GOOD THINGS

1:24:12.668 --> 1:24:14.670
YOU DID IN LIFE AND ALL
THE BAD THINGS YOU DID IN LIFE,

1:24:14.704 --> 1:24:16.568
AND IF YOU HAD MORE BAD THINGS
THAN GOOD THINGS,

1:24:16.603 --> 1:24:18.467
YOU WERE GOING TO HELL,

1:24:18.501 --> 1:24:20.745
AND HE HAD A VERY VIVID
IMPRESSION OF WHAT HELL MEANT.

1:24:20.779 --> 1:24:25.267
AND HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT
HE HAD A LOT OF NEGATIVE MARKS,

1:24:25.301 --> 1:24:28.442
THAT THE TALLYING ANGEL WAS
NOT GOING TO BE HAPPY

1:24:28.477 --> 1:24:30.168
WITH THE WAY HE HAD TREATED
WOMEN, IN PARTICULAR.

1:24:33.896 --> 1:24:38.211
30 YEARS AFTER
ALI FIRST FACED JOE FRAZIER,

1:24:38.245 --> 1:24:41.455
A REPORTER ASKED HIM ABOUT
THEIR LONG-RUNNING FEUD.

1:24:41.490 --> 1:24:43.181
"I CALLED HIM A LOT OF NAMES

1:24:43.216 --> 1:24:45.494
THAT I SHOULDN'T
HAVE CALLED HIM," ALI ADMITTED.

1:24:45.528 --> 1:24:49.118
"I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT.
I LIKE JOE FRAZIER.

1:24:49.153 --> 1:24:51.362
ME AND HIM WAS A GOOD SHOW."

1:24:51.396 --> 1:24:54.848
FRAZIER NEVER FORGAVE ALI.

1:24:54.882 --> 1:25:00.405
LATER, HE EXPRESSED SORROW
AT HAVING ABANDONED MALCOLM X.

1:25:00.440 --> 1:25:03.132
"TURNING MY BACK ON MALCOLM
WAS ONE OF THE MISTAKES

1:25:03.167 --> 1:25:06.239
THAT I REGRET MOST IN MY LIFE,"
HE WROTE.

1:25:06.273 --> 1:25:09.863
"I WISH I'D BEEN ABLE TO TELL
MALCOLM I WAS SORRY,

1:25:09.897 --> 1:25:15.351
THAT HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT
SO MANY THINGS."

1:25:15.386 --> 1:25:18.527
DADDY EVOLVED.
HE BECAME BETTER.

1:25:18.561 --> 1:25:22.565
AND DADDY SAID THAT,
"I'M BIGGER THAN BOXING."

1:25:22.600 --> 1:25:28.399
THAT MEANT BOXING WAS THIS MUCH.

1:25:31.436 --> 1:25:35.475
HIS EVOLUTION
INTO THE PERSON HE IS TODAY

1:25:35.509 --> 1:25:39.548
IS WAY BIGGER
THAN HIM JUST BOXING.

1:25:39.582 --> 1:25:42.378
AND I THINK HE KNEW THAT,

1:25:42.413 --> 1:25:46.451
AND HE CARRIED IT WITH HIM--

1:25:46.486 --> 1:25:49.385
HIS LOVE.

1:25:51.422 --> 1:25:55.357
AND HE GAVE IT
TO EVERY SINGLE PERSON HE MET.

1:25:55.391 --> 1:25:56.979
AND I THINK THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

1:26:00.016 --> 1:26:02.916
AS THE 20th CENTURY
CAME TO AN END,

1:26:02.950 --> 1:26:05.884
"NEWSWEEK," "TIME,"
AND "SPORTS ILLUSTRATED"

1:26:05.919 --> 1:26:11.200
ALL NAMED HIM
ATHLETE OF THE CENTURY.

1:26:11.235 --> 1:26:16.205
IN THE DAYS AFTER THE TERRORIST
ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001,

1:26:16.240 --> 1:26:19.519
AMERICAN MUSLIMS WERE
THE VICTIMS OF HATE CRIMES

1:26:19.553 --> 1:26:21.659
SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THEIR FAITH.

1:26:21.693 --> 1:26:25.939
"I AM A MUSLIM. I AM
AN AMERICAN," ALI RESPONDED.

1:26:25.973 --> 1:26:27.906
"IF THE CULPRITS ARE MUSLIM,

1:26:27.941 --> 1:26:30.392
"THEY HAVE TWISTED THE TEACHINGS
OF ISLAM.

1:26:30.426 --> 1:26:33.395
"WHOEVER PERFORMED
THE TERRORIST ATTACKS

1:26:33.429 --> 1:26:35.880
"DOES NOT REPRESENT ISLAM.

1:26:35.914 --> 1:26:39.642
GOD IS NOT BEHIND ASSASSINS."

1:26:39.677 --> 1:26:44.820
WHAT I HOPE IS THAT
MUHAMMAD ALI WILL BE

1:26:44.854 --> 1:26:48.824
A CONSTANT REMINDER TO AMERICA

1:26:48.858 --> 1:26:52.655
OF JUST HOW THOROUGHLY AMERICAN

1:26:52.690 --> 1:26:56.314
A BELIEVING, PRACTICING,
SINCERELY COMMITTED MUSLIM

1:26:56.349 --> 1:26:58.696
CAN BE.

1:26:58.730 --> 1:27:01.940
WHATEVER ONE'S BACKGROUND IS,
ALI BELONGS TO AMERICA,

1:27:01.975 --> 1:27:03.804
ALL OF US.

1:27:03.839 --> 1:27:05.599
AND I THINK THAT
HE BELONGS TO ALL OF US,

1:27:05.634 --> 1:27:07.808
BECAUSE HE AFFECTED ALL OF US.

1:27:07.843 --> 1:27:11.364
AND I HOPE THAT THAT'S PART OF
THE LEGACY THAT HE WILL LEAVE,

1:27:11.398 --> 1:27:16.576
THAT AMERICA WON'T FORGET ALI
AS THIS AMERICAN MUSLIM

1:27:16.610 --> 1:27:22.271
WITH EQUAL EMPHASIS
ON AMERICAN-MUSLIM.

1:27:22.306 --> 1:27:25.274
ON NOVEMBER 9, 2005,

1:27:25.309 --> 1:27:28.277
PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH
PRESENTED ALI

1:27:28.312 --> 1:27:30.762
WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL
OF FREEDOM,

1:27:30.797 --> 1:27:34.041
THE HIGHEST CIVILIAN HONOR
IN THE UNITED STATES.

1:27:34.076 --> 1:27:37.528
THAT SAME YEAR,
THE MUHAMMAD ALI CENTER,

1:27:37.562 --> 1:27:40.634
A MUSEUM DEDICATED TO HIS LIFE
AND LEGACY,

1:27:40.669 --> 1:27:42.636
OPENED IN LOUISVILLE.

1:27:42.671 --> 1:27:45.087
MUHAMMAD ALI WAS
AN ACTIVIST

1:27:45.121 --> 1:27:47.883
WHO FOUGHT TO REACH US
A CERTAIN WAY

1:27:47.917 --> 1:27:49.643
AND TO MOVE AMERICA
IN A CERTAIN WAY

1:27:49.678 --> 1:27:52.439
AND MOVE
INDIVIDUALS IN A CERTAIN WAY.

1:27:52.474 --> 1:27:55.477
"I'M GOING TO TAKE THIS PATH.
I BELIEVE THAT I'M RIGHT.

1:27:55.511 --> 1:27:57.720
AND EVEN IF I'M NOT RIGHT,
I'M STILL ME."

1:27:57.755 --> 1:28:02.622
AND TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THAT
AND TO KNOW THAT THERE WAS

1:28:02.656 --> 1:28:04.762
GOING TO BE AN ENORMOUS
PRICE TO PAY FOR THAT

1:28:04.796 --> 1:28:08.800
AND TO HAVE THAT
BE GENERATIONAL,

1:28:08.835 --> 1:28:14.392
TO HAVE THAT LIVE ON BEYOND YOU
IS EXTREMELY VALUABLE.

1:28:14.427 --> 1:28:19.466
EVERYTHING THAT HE DID
COULDN'T BE UNDONE.

1:28:30.891 --> 1:28:34.585
AS MY DAD'S
CONDITION PROGRESSED,

1:28:34.619 --> 1:28:42.455
IT BECAME MORE DIFFICULT
TO JUST WALK AND TO EAT

1:28:42.489 --> 1:28:46.113
AND TO JUST DO--
JUST THE LITTLE THINGS.

1:28:46.148 --> 1:28:49.393
YOU KNOW, GETTING UP OUT OF BED,

1:28:49.427 --> 1:28:54.846
GETTING--YOU KNOW, WALKING FROM
ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER, YOU KNOW?

1:28:54.881 --> 1:29:00.749
THE STOOPED POSTURE, YOU KNOW.
THAT'S THE LEANING OVER.

1:29:00.783 --> 1:29:02.785
IT WASN'T SO EASY AT THE END

1:29:02.820 --> 1:29:06.893
BECAUSE OF THE PARKINSON'S,
BUT HE STILL ENJOYED HIS LIFE.

1:29:06.927 --> 1:29:13.071
AND I NEVER, NEVER HEARD DADDY
COMPLAIN, NOT ONE TIME.

1:29:13.106 --> 1:29:16.454
BUT ON THE DAYS WHEN
HE SOUND GOOD, OH...

1:29:16.489 --> 1:29:19.630
THE SUN CAME OUT.

1:29:19.664 --> 1:29:23.150
ON JUNE 2, 2016,

1:29:23.185 --> 1:29:26.671
MUHAMMAD ALI CHECKED INTO
A SCOTTSDALE, ARIZONA, HOSPITAL

1:29:26.706 --> 1:29:29.156
WITH A RESPIRATORY INFECTION.

1:29:29.191 --> 1:29:33.816
ALI'S CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN
TRAVELED FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY

1:29:33.851 --> 1:29:37.164
TO BE AT HIS BEDSIDE.

1:29:37.199 --> 1:29:39.995
30 P.M. ON JUNE 3rd,

1:29:40.029 --> 1:29:42.825
DOCTORS DISCONNECTED HIM
FROM THE VENTILATOR

1:29:42.860 --> 1:29:44.758
THAT WAS HELPING HIM BREATHE.

1:29:47.140 --> 1:29:50.005
AS HIS RESPIRATION
GENTLY SLOWED,

1:29:50.039 --> 1:29:53.111
AN IMAM SANG THE MUSLIM CALL

1:29:53.146 --> 1:29:55.597
"THERE IS NO GOD BUT ALLAH,

1:29:55.631 --> 1:29:59.635
AND MUHAMMAD IS HIS MESSENGER."

1:29:59.670 --> 1:30:02.569
SOON, HE WAS GONE.

1:30:02.604 --> 1:30:07.471
MUHAMMAD ALI WAS 74 YEARS OLD.

1:30:07.505 --> 1:30:11.509
I GOT A TEXT FROM
THIS FRIEND.

1:30:11.544 --> 1:30:17.239
THE TEXT SAID,
"MUHAMMAD'S GONE."

1:30:17.273 --> 1:30:22.900
"MUHAMMAD'S GONE. DAMN."

1:30:22.934 --> 1:30:25.212
LIKE FUCK, MAN.

1:30:25.247 --> 1:30:31.046
YUP. "MUHAMMAD'S GONE. DAMN."

1:30:31.080 --> 1:30:32.910
I DIDN'T KNOW HIM.

1:30:32.944 --> 1:30:35.913
I MET HIM TWICE,
BUT HE WAS FAMILY.

1:30:40.020 --> 1:30:42.678
EVERYTHING
MY BROTHER SAID HE WOULD DO

1:30:42.713 --> 1:30:45.578
AS A CHILD, HE DID IT IN LIFE.

1:30:45.612 --> 1:30:47.027
HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO BE
A GREAT MAN,

1:30:47.062 --> 1:30:50.203
GOING TO BE A BOXER, BE A POET,

1:30:50.237 --> 1:30:54.138
BE KIND AND GOOD TO PEOPLE,
BE RICH.

1:30:54.172 --> 1:30:55.898
ALL THOSE THINGS HE
DID BEFORE HE DIED.

1:30:55.933 --> 1:30:57.659
SO HE DIED A RICH, HAPPY MAN.

1:31:00.731 --> 1:31:02.974
I LOVE MY DAD,

1:31:03.009 --> 1:31:04.838
BUT MUHAMMAD TAUGHT ME
A LOT OF STUFF

1:31:04.873 --> 1:31:06.771
THAT MY DAD DIDN'T TEACH ME.

1:31:06.806 --> 1:31:10.188
HE TAUGHT ME HOW TO HAVE
COURAGE,

1:31:10.223 --> 1:31:12.087
AND HE TAUGHT ME HOW TO, UM...

1:31:15.953 --> 1:31:19.163
FACE ADVERSITY.

1:31:19.197 --> 1:31:21.855
I--I MISS HIM.

1:31:21.890 --> 1:31:23.685
IT'S JUST SO HARD TO EXPLAIN.

1:31:23.719 --> 1:31:26.135
IT'S JUST LIKE
PART OF YOUR HEART'S JUST BROKEN

1:31:26.170 --> 1:31:28.103
EVEN TO THIS DAY, YOU KNOW.

1:31:28.137 --> 1:31:31.002
IT'S JUST LIKE
YOU CAN STILL HEAR HIS VOICE,

1:31:31.037 --> 1:31:34.765
YOU CAN STILL HEAR HIM SINGING,
LAUGHING, JOKING,

1:31:34.799 --> 1:31:39.286
SAD, HAPPY, YOU KNOW.

1:31:39.321 --> 1:31:41.323
BUT, UM, WE GO ON.

1:31:48.364 --> 1:31:50.263
HE USED TO HAVE
THIS DREAM

1:31:50.297 --> 1:31:52.852
THAT HE TALKED ABOUT
AND WROTE ABOUT,

1:31:52.886 --> 1:31:55.924
HOW HE WAS RUNNING DOWN BROADWAY
WHEN HE WAS A TEENAGER,

1:31:55.958 --> 1:31:59.755
AND HE SAID HE DREAMT THIS DREAM
ALL THE TIME,

1:31:59.790 --> 1:32:01.585
AND ALL OF THE SUDDEN,
PEOPLE WERE IN THE STREETS,

1:32:01.619 --> 1:32:03.345
AND THEY WERE CHANTING HIS NAME
AND WAVING AT HIM,

1:32:03.379 --> 1:32:05.036
AND HE LOOKED AT THEM,
AND HE'D WAVE BACK,

1:32:05.071 --> 1:32:07.591
AND HE WOULD JUST
TAKE OFF FLYING.

1:32:10.041 --> 1:32:12.009
IT WAS SO FUNNY

1:32:12.043 --> 1:32:15.668
BECAUSE AS I WAS IN THE CAR
FOLLOWING THE CASKET

1:32:15.702 --> 1:32:19.119
TO HIS FINAL RESTING PLACE,
AND THERE WERE ALL THE PEOPLE

1:32:19.154 --> 1:32:20.845
IN THE STREETS, AND THEY HAD
THE SIGNS UP,

1:32:20.880 --> 1:32:23.261
AND THERE WAS NOT
A GAP FOR MILES WE DROVE.

1:32:23.296 --> 1:32:25.954
IT WAS JUST AMAZING BECAUSE
THE STREETS AND THE BRIDGES,

1:32:25.988 --> 1:32:28.301
AND IT WAS JUST LINED
WITH THICK CROWDS OF PEOPLE

1:32:28.335 --> 1:32:30.130
CHANTING HIS NAME.

1:32:30.165 --> 1:32:34.341
AND, I THOUGHT, "OH, MY GOD.
THIS WAS HIS DREAM."

1:32:34.376 --> 1:32:38.622
THE FUNERAL PROCESSION
WOUND THROUGH LOUISVILLE,

1:32:38.656 --> 1:32:40.900
PAST THE MUHAMMAD ALI CENTER,

1:32:40.934 --> 1:32:43.212
ALONG MUHAMMAD ALI BOULEVARD,

1:32:43.247 --> 1:32:46.630
PAST HIS CHILDHOOD HOME
ON GRAND AVENUE,

1:32:46.664 --> 1:32:49.874
WHERE THE HEARSE WAS ALMOST
SWALLOWED UP BY THE CROWD,

1:32:49.909 --> 1:32:54.327
AND THEN, FINALLY,
TO CAVE HILL CEMETERY.

1:32:54.361 --> 1:32:59.194
HIS HEADSTONE WAS ENGRAVED

1:32:59.228 --> 1:33:01.886
"SERVICE TO OTHERS IS
THE RENT YOU PAY

1:33:01.921 --> 1:33:05.096
FOR YOUR ROOM IN HEAVEN."

1:33:05.131 --> 1:33:09.066
"IF THE MEASURE OF GREATNESS
IS TO GLADDEN THE HEART

1:33:09.100 --> 1:33:12.000
"OF EVERY HUMAN BEING ON
THE FACE OF THE EARTH,

1:33:12.034 --> 1:33:16.142
THEN HE TRULY WAS THE GREATEST,"
WROTE BOB DYLAN.

1:33:16.176 --> 1:33:19.386
"IN EVERY WAY HE WAS
THE BRAVEST,

1:33:19.421 --> 1:33:23.080
THE KINDEST,
AND THE MOST EXCELLENT OF MEN."

1:33:26.670 --> 1:33:29.983
OH, ALI, ALI.

1:33:30.018 --> 1:33:35.264
BLACK TARANTULA WHOSE
ANTICS HYPNOTIZE THE FOE.

1:33:35.299 --> 1:33:39.441
BUTTERFLY SIDE SLIPPING
DEATH FROM ROCKET PROBES.

1:33:39.475 --> 1:33:41.650
BEE WHOSE STING, UNSHEATHED,

1:33:41.685 --> 1:33:44.964
PICKS THE TEETH OF
THE RAGING HIPPOPOTAMUS.

1:33:44.998 --> 1:33:49.727
WARRIOR WHO SAID,
"I WILL NOT FIGHT,"

1:33:49.762 --> 1:33:54.249
YET PROVED A PROPHET'S CALL
TO ARMS AGAINST A WAR.

1:33:54.283 --> 1:33:58.356
CASSIUS MARCELLUS, WARRIOR,

1:33:58.391 --> 1:34:00.738
MUHAMMAD PROPHET,

1:34:00.773 --> 1:34:05.294
FLESH IS CLAY,
ALL, ALL TOO BRITTLE MOULD.

1:34:05.329 --> 1:34:07.469
THE BOUT IS OVER.

1:34:07.503 --> 1:34:10.921
FRAYED AND SPLIT
AND AUTOGRAPHED.

1:34:10.955 --> 1:34:14.856
THE GLOVES ARE HUNG UP IN
THE HALL OF FAME--STILL LOADED,

1:34:14.890 --> 1:34:18.825
EVEN FROM THAT FIRST
BLAZE OF GOLD AND GLORY.

1:34:18.860 --> 1:34:22.898
AWED MULTITUDES WILL GAZE,

1:34:22.933 --> 1:34:26.868
NEW QUESTERS
FEAST ON THESE MEMENTOS,

1:34:26.902 --> 1:34:32.459
AND FROM THEIR SHELL-SHOCKED
REMNANTS REINVOKE THE SPELL.

1:34:32.494 --> 1:34:37.326
BUT THE SORCERER IS GONE,

1:34:37.361 --> 1:34:41.814
THE LION WITHDRAWN TO
A LAIR OF TIME AND SPACE

1:34:41.848 --> 1:34:45.438
INACCESSIBLE AS
THE SACRED LINING OF A CROWN

1:34:45.472 --> 1:34:50.892
WHEN KINGS WERE KINGS,
AND LORDS OF RHYME AND PACE.

1:34:50.926 --> 1:34:57.450
THE ENCHANTMENT IS OVER,
BUT THE SPELL REMAINS.
