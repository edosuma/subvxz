03:03.183 --> 03:04.559
How are you?

03:12.650 --> 03:13.651
Hello!

03:15.028 --> 03:16.946
Yes, this is Harold Angel.

03:17.405 --> 03:19.449
Yes, initial R, like in the phone book.

03:19.908 --> 03:21.117
Excuse me?

03:22.035 --> 03:23.286
Winesap.

03:24.496 --> 03:28.124
Herman Winesap,
Winesap & Mackintosh?

03:28.625 --> 03:30.251
Hold on a second!

03:34.422 --> 03:36.925
Winesap from Winesap &...

03:37.383 --> 03:40.303
Mackintosh. I've got it!

03:42.931 --> 03:45.600
Of course I know what an attorney is.

03:46.059 --> 03:49.312
It's like a lawyer,
only the bills are bigger.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.149
Sure, I'll hold.

03:53.608 --> 03:54.609
Asshole!

04:00.573 --> 04:03.409
Hello, Mr. Winesap? Harold Angel.

04:06.204 --> 04:08.414
Yeah, I could be free.

04:09.582 --> 04:11.501
Would this be with your firm?

04:16.005 --> 04:17.382
Gimme that again.

04:19.509 --> 04:22.512
Louis... how do you spell that?

04:24.806 --> 04:28.142
Cyphre... okay.
What is it... foreign?

04:29.018 --> 04:32.105
Is your client a foreigner?

04:35.066 --> 04:38.736
Mr. Winesap, could you
give me a few more details?

04:41.948 --> 04:43.074
Okay, I know the place.

04:45.034 --> 04:47.203
It's a long way up, but I can be there.

05:30.121 --> 05:33.708
Hallelujah!
Show right now how much you love God!

05:34.167 --> 05:36.544
I want you to show! It's your time!

05:37.003 --> 05:39.672
Open up your hearts
and open up your wallets!

05:40.423 --> 05:41.424
Open your purses!

05:41.883 --> 05:42.967
Open your pockets!

05:43.426 --> 05:47.263
And give it up! Praise the Lord!
Somebody has been talking about me

05:47.722 --> 05:52.644
riding around in a Cadillac.
If you love me and want to give to me,

05:53.102 --> 05:55.480
then I should be in a Rolls-Royce!

06:11.079 --> 06:13.122
Would you come with me, please?

06:26.636 --> 06:28.346
An unfortunate husband

06:28.805 --> 06:32.934
of one of Pastor John's flock
took a gun to his head. Most unpleasant.

06:33.685 --> 06:36.187
Mr. Angel? Please?

07:00.628 --> 07:04.966
Allow me to introduce my client,
Monsieur Louis Cyphre.

07:06.593 --> 07:10.638
Hi, Harry Angel.
- Pleased to meet you, Mr. Angel.

07:13.391 --> 07:16.728
I don't want to appear impolite,

07:17.187 --> 07:19.981
but do you have any I. D.?
- Sure! Here...

07:24.944 --> 07:26.696
How's that?

07:27.155 --> 07:28.948
GU N PERM IT

07:36.998 --> 07:39.626
Nothing personal.
I'm a little over-cautious.

07:40.084 --> 07:44.923
You know how these things are.
- I know. So...

07:45.381 --> 07:48.343
How did you hear about me?

07:55.725 --> 07:58.436
I guess
you guys just looked in the phone book.

08:02.273 --> 08:07.487
Usually that's what happens. Because
my name is "Angel", it's under "A"...

08:07.946 --> 08:10.448
People are lazy.
They see the first name

08:10.990 --> 08:12.742
and...
- Johnny Favorite.

08:13.201 --> 08:14.077
Excuse me?

08:14.536 --> 08:17.580
Do you by chance remember
the name Johnny Favorite?

08:18.331 --> 08:20.792
Johnny...
No, I don't think so.

08:21.376 --> 08:23.920
You never knew him?
- Am I supposed to?

08:24.379 --> 08:27.382
He was a crooner before the war,
quite famous in his way.

08:29.425 --> 08:32.220
Well, I tell you, Mr. Cyphre...

08:35.222 --> 08:36.890
I'm sorry!

08:39.519 --> 08:41.312
I usually don't get involved

08:41.770 --> 08:48.570
in anything very heavy. I usually
handle insurance jobs, divorces,

08:49.028 --> 08:51.072
things of that nature.

08:51.531 --> 08:56.953
If I'm lucky sometimes
I handle people. But I don't know

08:57.412 --> 08:59.581
no crooners

09:00.039 --> 09:03.042
or anybody famous.
- His real name was Liebling.

09:03.501 --> 09:07.672
I don't know any Liebling, either.

09:09.007 --> 09:11.176
What do you want from me?

09:11.634 --> 09:14.345
Does this man owe you money?
- Not quite.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.973
I helped Johnny
at the beginning of his career.

09:17.432 --> 09:20.894
You were like... his agent?

09:21.352 --> 09:23.605
No!

09:24.230 --> 09:25.940
Nothing so...

09:26.399 --> 09:29.110
Monsieur Cyphre has a contract.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.989
Certain collateral was to be forfeited
in the event of his death.

09:33.448 --> 09:37.660
You're talking about a guy that's dead?
- He was drafted in '43,

09:38.119 --> 09:41.456
North Africa.
"Special Entertainment Services".

09:41.915 --> 09:44.959
There was an attack,
and his head and face was badly injured.

09:45.418 --> 09:49.297
He had...
- Amnesia. I think you call it...

09:49.881 --> 09:53.301
Shell shock.
- Exactly! - I know how that feels.

09:53.760 --> 09:58.056
Why? Were you in the services?
- I was in for a short time.

09:58.515 --> 10:01.392
But I got a little fucked up.

10:01.851 --> 10:07.482
Excuse me! They shipped me home,
and I missed the whole shebang:

10:07.941 --> 10:13.154
The war, the medals, everything.
I guess you could say I was lucky.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.741
Johnny wasn't so lucky.
He returned home a zombie.

10:17.200 --> 10:21.371
His friends had him transferred
to a private hospital upstate.

10:21.830 --> 10:25.458
There was some sort of
radical psychiatric treatment involved.

10:25.917 --> 10:28.753
His lawyers had
the power of attorney

10:29.212 --> 10:31.840
to pay the bills, things like that.
But you know how it is.

10:32.298 --> 10:36.469
He remained a vegetable, and my
contract was never honored. - I see.

10:36.928 --> 10:39.764
I don't want to sound mercenary.

10:40.223 --> 10:45.645
My only interest in Johnny
is in finding out if he's alive or dead.

10:46.104 --> 10:49.858
Each year my office receives a
signed affidavit confirming

10:50.316 --> 10:53.403
that Johnny Liebling
is indeed among the living.

10:53.862 --> 10:57.532
But last weekend
Monsieur Cyphre and I, just by chance,

10:57.991 --> 11:01.161
were near the clinic in Poughkeepsie.

11:01.619 --> 11:06.040
We decided to check for ourselves,
but we got misleading information.

11:06.624 --> 11:07.625
The run-around!

11:08.084 --> 11:12.172
I didn't want to cause a scene,
I hate any sort of fuss.

11:12.797 --> 11:14.632
I thought, perhaps you could

11:15.383 --> 11:17.802
subtly and in a quiet manner...

11:18.261 --> 11:20.847
You want me to check it out.
- Check it out!

11:28.771 --> 11:31.024
I have a feeling I've met you before.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.568
I don't know, I don't think so.

11:47.332 --> 11:50.960
Do you remember
the name Johnny Favorite?

11:55.924 --> 11:58.176
His real name was Liebling.

12:03.765 --> 12:07.769
My only interest in Johnny
is in finding out if he's alive or dead.

12:50.520 --> 12:53.982
May I help you?
- My name is Harry Conroy

12:54.440 --> 12:57.652
from the National Institute of Health.

12:58.987 --> 13:01.698
Is there
anyone in particular you want to see?

13:02.157 --> 13:06.327
The Institute is conducting a survey
of incurable trauma cases.

13:06.786 --> 13:10.999
I understand you have a patient here
fitting that description?

13:11.875 --> 13:14.335
We can't let you see anyone
without an appointment.

13:14.794 --> 13:18.173
I appreciate that,
but maybe you could check the files

13:18.631 --> 13:20.425
and make sure I'm on the right track.

13:20.884 --> 13:23.261
I don't want to bother anybody
unnecessarily.

13:24.179 --> 13:26.222
Okay? Thank you.

13:27.265 --> 13:30.518
What's the name of the patient?
- Liebling, Jonathan Liebling.

13:31.769 --> 13:33.813
One moment please, I'll check.

13:37.734 --> 13:40.069
Were you working here last weekend?

13:40.528 --> 13:44.532
No, day off.
- Did you do anything nice?

13:44.991 --> 13:47.410
My sister's wedding.

13:49.287 --> 13:53.208
We did have a Mr. Liebling,
but he was transferred.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.710
You sure?
- That's what it says.

13:56.544 --> 14:00.632
And when was that?
- Years ago, in December '43.

14:01.090 --> 14:03.551
May I take a look at this? Thanks.

14:06.638 --> 14:07.805
Is this recent?

14:08.264 --> 14:10.350
It's an old file.
- It's in ballpoint!

14:10.808 --> 14:13.728
They weren't big on ballpoint in '43.

14:14.229 --> 14:16.105
Is that ballpoint?

14:16.564 --> 14:19.484
Well, I'll be!
They didn't have ballpoints back then?

14:20.818 --> 14:21.820
No.

14:22.487 --> 14:23.488
This here

14:23.947 --> 14:25.573
Dr. Fowler,

14:26.032 --> 14:30.203
does he still work here?
- Just part-time, he's old.

14:31.955 --> 14:33.164
Thank you.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.032
Time for your evening fix?

17:16.661 --> 17:19.454
Who are you?
How did you get in here?

17:20.205 --> 17:23.751
Through the mailslot.
I'm a private detective.

17:24.460 --> 17:26.503
Breaking and entering is a crime,

17:26.963 --> 17:31.009
whoever or whatever you are.
- Hey man, call the police!

17:31.676 --> 17:34.053
Which you won't do in case
they discover your opium den

17:34.512 --> 17:36.556
in the icebox!

17:44.147 --> 17:48.610
I'm a doctor. I'm perfectly entitled
to keep pharmaceuticals at home.

17:49.068 --> 17:53.490
Tell it to somebody else!
We're not talking about a Band-Aid

17:53.948 --> 17:57.619
or a tube of unguent. How long you
been hooked? - What do you want?

17:58.328 --> 18:00.914
Information about Johnny Liebling.

18:01.706 --> 18:04.375
I treated a patient
of that name many years ago.

18:04.834 --> 18:06.836
I'm not fooling around.

18:09.923 --> 18:13.885
Either you give me some answers
or I'll call the police myself.

18:14.344 --> 18:18.139
I've seen the works cooking upstairs,
and it ain't Mr. Salk's vaccine.

18:18.598 --> 18:21.684
He was an entertainer
during the war, a neuro case.

18:22.143 --> 18:25.855
No chance of recovery, so I transferred
him to a V.A. Hospital in Albany.

18:26.314 --> 18:29.859
I hate to shake you up,
but I checked, and he's not there.

18:30.735 --> 18:32.946
You faked the transfer.

18:33.404 --> 18:37.200
Because he recently had a visitor,
the first in 12 years.

18:38.076 --> 18:39.953
Popular guy, eh?

18:42.580 --> 18:46.042
Where is he now?
- I don't know... - Come here!

18:47.836 --> 18:51.673
I haven't seen him
since he was a patient here.

18:52.340 --> 18:54.509
You're in a cold sweat! Look at you!

18:54.968 --> 18:59.180
You can't wait for me to leave
so you can raid the icebox.

18:59.806 --> 19:04.394
The sooner you get out with it,
the sooner you can shoot up.

19:07.272 --> 19:11.109
I'll ask you again: Where is he?

19:11.609 --> 19:13.111
I don't know.

19:13.570 --> 19:18.616
Some people came one night years ago.
He got in the car with them and left.

19:19.075 --> 19:21.619
He got into a car?
I thought this guy was a vegetable.

19:22.078 --> 19:25.290
At first he was in a coma
but he quickly recovered.

19:25.748 --> 19:27.792
But he still suffered from amnesia.

19:28.501 --> 19:29.502
The friends.

19:30.670 --> 19:35.425
Who were the friends?
- His name was Kelley, Edward Kelley.

19:35.884 --> 19:38.928
The young lady I don't know.
She stayed in the car.

19:39.387 --> 19:43.600
Where did they take him? - Down South.
The man said: "We're taking him home."

19:44.309 --> 19:46.102
And what was the deal?
- $25,000.

19:46.561 --> 19:50.565
For what? - I was supposed to pretend
that he was still a patient in hospital.

19:51.024 --> 19:54.736
Didn't the administration suspect?
- Why should they? I kept the charts

19:55.195 --> 20:00.408
up to date. And no one asks questions
when the bills get paid.

20:01.159 --> 20:03.036
Tell me about Johnny Liebling.

20:03.495 --> 20:07.957
What did he look like?
- No idea. His face was damaged.

20:08.416 --> 20:12.712
He had facial reconstruction.
He was in bandages the day he left.

20:13.505 --> 20:15.590
What can you tell me about Kelley?

20:16.049 --> 20:20.136
It's too long ago.
I only have a vague memory.

20:20.595 --> 20:24.432
He was well dressed
and had a southern accent.

20:24.891 --> 20:30.021
I truly don't remember.
- All right, Doc. Have a lie down.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.732
I'm going out to grab a cheeseburger.

20:33.191 --> 20:37.487
Maybe a few hours cold turkey
will refresh your memory.

20:44.285 --> 20:47.038
Watch yourself!

20:47.747 --> 20:51.751
We're going to take
a little nap, sit your ass down.

20:52.210 --> 20:54.087
We're going to clear your mind.

20:55.672 --> 20:57.757
I'm going out. When I get back,

20:58.216 --> 21:01.010
I'll fix you some goodies
from the icebox, alright?

21:01.469 --> 21:05.515
Tell me what I want to know
and you'll get rid of me forever.

23:40.879 --> 23:43.423
I'm back, Doc!
I brought you a little something!

23:48.887 --> 23:51.389
I didn't think
you'd want a cheeseburger...

25:18.601 --> 25:20.770
I will! Bye!

25:21.229 --> 25:22.564
Hi, Ellie!

25:23.982 --> 25:25.900
Is that your boyfriend?

25:26.776 --> 25:29.279
He's got a car and everything?

25:32.282 --> 25:33.366
See you later!

26:10.361 --> 26:12.697
Did you see him?
- No.

26:13.156 --> 26:16.409
Why not?
- It would've been difficult. - Why?

26:16.868 --> 26:19.120
Why? Because he's not there.

26:20.121 --> 26:24.667
Johnny Favorite
walked out of the clinic 12 years ago,

26:25.126 --> 26:30.298
in his best suit, with a new face
wrapped in bandages and a headache.

26:30.757 --> 26:32.634
He left with a guy called Kelley

26:33.092 --> 26:36.638
and a girl.
Do you know this Kelley?

26:38.848 --> 26:42.810
It seems this Kelley paid off
some bent doctor called Fowler

26:43.269 --> 26:47.649
to pinch hit for your guy.
He's covered up for him all these years.

26:55.156 --> 26:57.492
Looks like our Johnny has

26:57.951 --> 27:01.704
a perfect disappearing act.
- It seems so.

27:04.249 --> 27:06.376
But you know what they say about slugs.

27:06.835 --> 27:09.712
No, what do they say about slugs?

27:10.547 --> 27:12.632
They always leave slime in their tracks.

27:20.306 --> 27:23.017
You'll find him.
- No, I won't find him.

27:24.936 --> 27:27.772
Because I left out one little detail.

27:29.023 --> 27:31.151
This Dr. Fowler ended up dead

27:31.609 --> 27:34.445
with his fucking brains blown out.

27:37.365 --> 27:39.576
Did you kill him?
- No!

27:40.034 --> 27:42.078
But the cops might think I did.

27:43.329 --> 27:47.375
I took on a $125-a-day
missing persons job for you.

27:47.834 --> 27:51.588
Now, I'm a murder suspect.
That's it! I'm out.

27:52.589 --> 27:58.720
Such are the hazards of your profession.
If the fee bothers you, we'll adjust it.

27:59.179 --> 28:00.638
You bother me!

28:01.097 --> 28:03.766
The closest I ever come to death

28:04.225 --> 28:09.564
is watching a hearse go by
on 2nd Avenue. That's the way I like it.

28:11.649 --> 28:12.650
Are you afraid?

28:14.652 --> 28:15.987
Yeah, I'm afraid.

28:17.405 --> 28:20.658
I'll instruct my lawyer immediately
to send you a check for $5,000.

28:21.117 --> 28:25.163
If you don't want the job,
I'll engage someone else.

28:29.792 --> 28:30.793
5,000?

28:36.049 --> 28:38.092
You want this Johnny pretty bad, eh?

28:39.761 --> 28:41.471
I don't like messy accounts.

28:45.934 --> 28:51.981
Some religions think the egg is the
symbol of the soul, did you know that?

28:52.440 --> 28:53.983
No.

29:00.365 --> 29:01.658
Would you like an egg?

29:06.329 --> 29:08.957
No, thank you.
I got a thing about chickens.

33:04.901 --> 33:08.196
It's after eleven, you're late.
- I'm sorry.

33:10.031 --> 33:12.784
You get it?
- If I lose my job,

33:13.952 --> 33:15.745
I'll come and be your secretary.

33:16.204 --> 33:21.000
I couldn't pay you what the "Times"
pays. Besides, they won't miss it.

33:22.252 --> 33:24.671
Hi, Johnny, where the fuck are you?

33:25.505 --> 33:29.634
He really was a crooner, like you said.
I didn't realize he was so big.

33:30.093 --> 33:34.222
He was in a band called the Spider
Simpson Orchestra. They're all dead.

33:34.639 --> 33:38.810
Only Spider is here in town.
- Where? - I wrote it all down.

33:39.269 --> 33:40.854
The dyke in the archive is suspicious.

33:41.604 --> 33:44.232
My boss hasn't
researched the story in years.

33:44.691 --> 33:46.317
You can get the files.

33:46.776 --> 33:49.696
Spider is in an old people's home
on 138th Street.

33:50.822 --> 33:53.116
Oh, I get to go to Harlem again.

33:53.575 --> 33:56.744
There was a picture of Johnny
with Toots Sweet, a guitar player.

33:57.203 --> 33:58.955
No one's heard of him for years!

33:59.414 --> 34:01.457
Johnny was engaged to a rich broad,

34:01.916 --> 34:05.795
Margaret Krusemark.
Her dad owns half of Louisiana.

34:06.254 --> 34:11.217
Met him at a high school prom. Johnny
shit on her, and she went back to Daddy.

34:11.592 --> 34:13.594
There's lots on their spells.

34:14.053 --> 34:16.723
Spells, what do you mean, spells?

34:17.806 --> 34:19.851
The eye of a newt,

34:20.310 --> 34:23.730
toe of a frog and that kind of shit?
- Seems she was a bit of a crackpot.

34:24.188 --> 34:27.108
Casting spells
at society do's and stuff.

34:27.567 --> 34:32.572
Didn't go down too well with
the lvy League stiffos.

34:33.031 --> 34:37.118
She was known as the Witch of Wellesly.

34:38.453 --> 34:40.163
Did I do good?

34:40.621 --> 34:46.585
Great! So what've I got:
A religious loonie as a client.

34:47.045 --> 34:50.130
I gotta find Johnny "Golden Tonsils"
and we don't know where he is.

34:50.590 --> 34:53.801
And he probably doesn't know who he is.

34:54.260 --> 34:58.264
I got a geriatric bandleader
in a home in Harlem.

34:58.723 --> 35:01.643
I got a guitar player
called Toots Sweet.

35:02.101 --> 35:03.645
What else have I got?

35:04.103 --> 35:05.396
A hard-on?

35:10.485 --> 35:11.945
Are you okay?

35:49.566 --> 35:50.775
January 3rd,

35:51.234 --> 35:56.531
1955. Client: Louis Cyphre.
Copy: Winesap & Mackintosh,

35:56.990 --> 36:01.035
attorneys. As reported,
Johnny Favorite has not been

36:01.494 --> 36:05.874
in the Sarah Dodd Clinic in
Poughkeepsie for the last 12 years.

36:06.416 --> 36:10.837
He was taken away by a man
called Edward Kelley and a girl.

36:11.296 --> 36:13.173
The girl is unidentified.

36:13.631 --> 36:17.343
Kelley paid a Dr. Fowler $25,000
to falsify reports

36:17.802 --> 36:20.763
stating
that Favorite was still in the hospital.

36:25.810 --> 36:29.481
The doctor is now deceased.

36:31.065 --> 36:34.736
Before Johnny's accident it seemed
like his career was going great,

36:35.195 --> 36:40.158
until he started to dump on everyone.
I tracked down Spider Simpson,

36:40.617 --> 36:43.661
Johnny's old bandleader. He resides

36:44.120 --> 36:46.873
at the Lincoln Presbyterian Hospice

36:47.332 --> 36:51.961
on 138th Street. Johnny also
had a good buddy, a guitar player

36:52.420 --> 36:55.715
called Toots Sweet.
Toots went back to Algiers.

36:56.174 --> 36:59.886
That's Algiers in New Orleans.

37:00.345 --> 37:04.390
I think maybe Margaret went back there,
and maybe Johnny, too.

37:05.266 --> 37:10.104
Oh, yeah! According to Spider,
Johnny had a secret love.

37:10.563 --> 37:13.358
A black lady
called Evangeline Proudfoot.

37:14.651 --> 37:19.322
Evangeline ran
some kind of spooky store in Harlem

37:19.864 --> 37:21.825
called "Mammy Carter's."

37:28.873 --> 37:32.043
You don't
need to know that, Cyphre. I think

37:33.127 --> 37:35.880
a secret love should stay secret.

37:37.590 --> 37:38.591
The only person

37:39.050 --> 37:41.219
who Johnny was seeing regularly

37:41.678 --> 37:45.557
was a palm reader
in Coney Island called Madame Zora.

38:06.828 --> 38:08.454
Are you lzzy?

38:10.915 --> 38:13.376
Looks like the last bit of sun, eh?

38:13.835 --> 38:18.923
The guy in the arcade over there
told me you might be able to help me.

38:19.382 --> 38:24.387
I'm looking for Madame Zora. - I know
her, friend of the wife before the war.

38:24.846 --> 38:28.224
She was a fortune teller, right?
- And then some!

38:28.683 --> 38:33.271
I hate those hocus-pocus bitches!
Her and the wife got along real well.

38:33.730 --> 38:35.857
Wife's a baptist. Oh, here!

38:36.983 --> 38:38.401
Have a nose shield!

38:38.860 --> 38:43.907
Go on, take one. I found a whole
boxful under the boardwalk.

38:44.365 --> 38:46.075
There's not much sun right now.

38:46.534 --> 38:48.244
Yeah, but it keeps the rain off too.

38:49.454 --> 38:51.831
Ever hear of a Johnny Favorite?

38:52.332 --> 38:55.668
The singer?
- Yeah, he used to visit Madame Zora.

38:56.127 --> 38:59.797
Heard of him, but don't know nothing.
Ask the wife.

39:00.256 --> 39:04.010
She always sings stupid tunes
off the radio. She knows all that shit.

39:04.469 --> 39:06.888
She likes the water, eh?
- She hates it.

39:07.347 --> 39:10.767
She's getting on the heavy side.
She thinks it's good for varicose veins.

39:13.478 --> 39:15.355
Alright, thanks.

39:16.606 --> 39:18.691
What do you do here in the summer?

39:19.067 --> 39:20.652
Bite the heads off the rats.

39:22.487 --> 39:24.781
And in the winter?
- The same.

39:37.627 --> 39:39.337
Excuse me!

39:40.922 --> 39:43.591
I was just talking to your husband.

39:44.050 --> 39:46.886
I was inquiring about Madame Zora.

39:47.345 --> 39:50.348
Yeah, I knew her before the war,
Madame Zora, you say?

39:50.807 --> 39:53.351
Yeah, she was a gypsy fortune teller!

39:53.810 --> 39:59.524
Had the booth across the boardwalk from
me. She was a debutante not a gypsy,

39:59.983 --> 40:02.402
and she did
more than just read tea leaves.

40:03.236 --> 40:09.284
Did you ever see her with a guy called
Johnny Favorite? - Yeah, he was cute.

40:09.742 --> 40:15.123
She was stuck on him. He was called
"Golden Tonsils". I knew all his tunes.

40:15.582 --> 40:18.084
Have you ever
heard of a Margaret Krusemark?

40:18.543 --> 40:23.840
Don't be a gazoony, fellah!
Madame Zora was Margaret Krusemark.

40:25.967 --> 40:27.177
Well what happened to her?

40:27.635 --> 40:32.557
Packed up her stuff
and went back home, down south.

40:33.016 --> 40:35.560
You have any idea
where I could find Johnny Favorite?

40:36.060 --> 40:40.106
No, maybe the cemetery.
Want to hear one of his tunes?

40:51.034 --> 40:54.329
Thanks for the nose shield.
I'm going to need it where I'm going.

40:54.787 --> 40:58.166
In Brooklyn?
- Louisiana. - Nice.

41:00.793 --> 41:01.961
Where'd he go?

42:51.196 --> 42:54.782
FOR COLORED PATRONS ON LY

43:57.595 --> 44:02.600
Mr. Angel? Sorry to keep you waiting,
but you're a little early.

44:03.059 --> 44:07.772
I had a bad line.
I didn't know if you said 4:00 or 4:30.

44:12.026 --> 44:16.865
This is a wild place you got here!
- Yes, I've been very happy here.

44:17.323 --> 44:20.785
I've never had my fortune read before.
Does it take long?

44:21.244 --> 44:26.040
I'll take the details now. It usually
takes a couple of days to do a chart.

44:30.086 --> 44:31.129
Tea?

44:33.673 --> 44:34.674
Do you want some tea?

44:35.133 --> 44:36.718
Yes, thank you.

44:42.724 --> 44:45.268
Darjeeling, jasmine or oolong?

44:48.646 --> 44:50.148
Not many people like oolong.

45:00.450 --> 45:02.160
Do you play the piano?

45:03.453 --> 45:04.829
No, not exactly.

45:06.372 --> 45:07.373
Sing?

45:08.374 --> 45:11.544
I can carry a tune,
but no... not really.

45:15.924 --> 45:18.635
Who is this mean looking guy?

45:20.428 --> 45:21.429
My father.

45:21.888 --> 45:23.515
I'm sorry!

45:24.140 --> 45:25.683
Don't worry, he hates it too.

45:26.059 --> 45:31.606
He looks like one of those guys
in an old pirate movie. What's his name?

45:32.065 --> 45:35.360
Ethan.
- Ethan Krusemark...

45:36.194 --> 45:39.030
Well, I tell you,
I never saw any of Ethan's movies.

45:50.667 --> 45:52.210
Do you speak French?

45:53.920 --> 45:54.921
I'm from Brooklyn.

45:55.505 --> 45:59.759
I would prefer it if you didn't smoke.
- That's okay.

46:00.218 --> 46:01.553
Cream or sugar?

46:02.011 --> 46:04.264
Straight up is fine, thank you.

46:05.473 --> 46:07.976
I need your exact date of birth.

46:08.935 --> 46:09.978
Sure!

46:10.436 --> 46:14.440
I was born on February 14th...

46:18.611 --> 46:21.906
...1918, on Valentine's day.

46:23.533 --> 46:28.496
How curious! I used to know a boy
who was born on that exact same day.

46:28.955 --> 46:34.335
Well, you know how it is,
all the soldiers home on leave and all.

46:34.794 --> 46:38.965
Maybe we could pull your friend's chart
and save ourselves some time.

46:39.424 --> 46:44.053
I don't think so. Every person
is very different. I don't think

46:44.512 --> 46:46.473
you'd like his chart.

46:47.849 --> 46:48.892
Place of birth?

46:50.727 --> 46:54.439
Brooklyn, New York.
Was your friend a jerk or something?

46:55.732 --> 46:57.108
You could say that.

46:59.360 --> 47:01.946
I guess you didn't get along.

47:03.281 --> 47:04.282
You and Johnny.

47:10.121 --> 47:12.457
You and Johnny Favorite?

47:20.089 --> 47:23.092
Who are you?
- I was an old army buddy.

47:24.135 --> 47:27.597
I thought you two were kinda...

47:28.640 --> 47:33.144
Look, I ain't no army buddy, I'm just
a guy who was paid to snoop around.

47:33.603 --> 47:36.689
To tell the truth,
I wasn't born on Valentine's day.

47:37.148 --> 47:40.485
It's Johnny's future I'm interested in.

47:40.944 --> 47:43.696
Johnny has no future, he's dead.

47:44.447 --> 47:46.866
He died 12 years ago.
I'd like you to leave.

47:47.617 --> 47:52.622
I know you're thinking who is this creep
poking his snitch in everything.

47:53.081 --> 47:57.335
I don't want to sound nosy, but...
- He's dead, Mr. Angel.

47:57.794 --> 48:00.171
And if he isn't, he is to me.

48:01.881 --> 48:04.092
He must've hurt you pretty bad!

48:04.551 --> 48:06.761
We all have our scars.

48:07.220 --> 48:12.016
I don't know too much about the guy, but
he must've been stupid to let you go.

48:12.475 --> 48:16.563
Lies and cruelty
come very easily to some people.

48:17.021 --> 48:20.775
Pity, I really would've liked
to have gotten my palm read.

48:21.234 --> 48:24.320
Then I could have held
your hand just a little longer.

48:26.364 --> 48:29.534
I don't think you'd like what I see.

48:32.579 --> 48:34.122
Very pretty necklace!

49:09.407 --> 49:11.242
You got any High John

49:11.701 --> 49:14.162
the Conquerer root?
- Powdered or hanging?

49:14.621 --> 49:16.414
I'm not really sure.

49:16.873 --> 49:18.124
Caught in the rain, eh?

49:22.462 --> 49:24.464
Two roots, $1.20.

49:26.925 --> 49:32.722
I have a question.
I had an acquaintance in Harlem

49:33.181 --> 49:35.016
who used to deal in the root.

49:35.475 --> 49:37.519
Name was Evangeline. Heard of her?

49:37.977 --> 49:41.147
Practically everyone around here is
called Evangeline. After the poem.

49:41.940 --> 49:43.233
Do you know it?

49:44.067 --> 49:46.611
Yeah, I know it.

49:47.362 --> 49:50.782
This acquaintance had a store in Harlem
and it was the same name:

49:51.241 --> 49:53.743
"Carter."
- Everybody uses the name, mister.

49:54.202 --> 49:56.913
Like "Howard Johnson,"
but this is the real place.

49:57.539 --> 49:59.249
Her name was Proudfoot.

50:00.250 --> 50:02.126
Evangeline Proudfoot?

50:04.504 --> 50:09.008
I knew her. She used to come back all
the time when she lived in New York.

50:09.467 --> 50:13.054
Do you know where she is now?
- She got sick and died.

50:13.513 --> 50:16.975
She went back to the Holy Shelter
swamp and was buried in Armandville.

50:17.433 --> 50:22.355
She was waiting on some fellah.
- Just like in the poem? - Yep.

50:22.814 --> 50:24.190
$1.20.

50:28.069 --> 50:30.738
Who was the guy?
- She never told.

50:34.701 --> 50:35.702
Okay, thanks.

50:43.293 --> 50:45.128
A week, you say?
- At the most.

51:44.187 --> 51:46.189
What is it?

51:47.315 --> 51:49.108
Why are you crying?

51:49.567 --> 51:52.654
We're going to Grandma. What's there?

51:53.530 --> 51:54.531
Grandma.

51:54.989 --> 51:56.366
Grandma.

52:10.296 --> 52:11.631
Let's go.

52:13.466 --> 52:14.884
Give me your hand.

53:09.606 --> 53:12.525
I'm sorry!
I got these off a guy in Coney Island.

53:12.984 --> 53:15.069
Some crazy guy.

53:17.530 --> 53:18.740
I'm sorry.

53:19.199 --> 53:20.533
Stop crying.

53:23.328 --> 53:26.956
I was hoping
I could talk with your mother.

53:28.333 --> 53:30.919
You're a little late.
Did you know her?

53:31.377 --> 53:36.090
No, I never met her but I was hoping
she could answer some questions for me.

53:36.716 --> 53:38.051
Are you a cop?

53:38.510 --> 53:40.512
No, my name is Harry Angel.

53:42.430 --> 53:44.390
I'm a private detective.

53:44.849 --> 53:48.061
So what's...?
- Epiphany.

53:50.647 --> 53:53.650
Your mama left you
with a very beautiful name.

53:54.108 --> 53:55.443
And not much else.

53:56.903 --> 54:00.240
Actually, I'm looking for
a friend of your mother's,

54:01.324 --> 54:03.910
a guy called Johnny Favorite.

54:04.369 --> 54:07.080
I met all her friends
but never anyone called Favorite.

54:09.207 --> 54:10.750
Shit!

54:12.001 --> 54:13.753
I got a thing about chickens.

54:18.466 --> 54:23.012
This Favorite was friends with your
mother in New York city before the war.

54:23.471 --> 54:28.059
Well, she never told me.
Mama had a lot of guys. She liked men.

54:28.893 --> 54:30.478
How about a guy called Toots Sweet?

54:30.937 --> 54:35.859
He was a friend of Favorite. Know him?
- No. - He was a good guitar player.

54:36.317 --> 54:38.486
I was going to catch his act tonight.

54:41.573 --> 54:45.076
I'm going to be
staying in town, in a hotel.

54:45.535 --> 54:48.037
If you remember anything

54:48.496 --> 54:52.333
that might help me,
give me a call.

55:00.633 --> 55:04.304
You're a very pretty girl, Epiphany,
your name suits you.

55:08.766 --> 55:10.185
These crazy chickens!

55:17.233 --> 55:19.527
What are you after him for,
Johnny Favorite?

55:19.986 --> 55:24.199
I'm not after him. I'm just being paid
to find out where he is.

55:24.657 --> 55:28.745
He could be 6 feet under.
- Then I'll have to buy a shovel.

56:28.513 --> 56:30.223
How are you, sugar?

57:00.628 --> 57:01.921
Some beautiful tune

57:02.380 --> 57:06.092
you were singing there, Mr. Sweet.
- Toots, son! Thanks. - Buy you a drink?

57:06.551 --> 57:11.556
Mine's on the house. Special cocktail.
Whatever's in it gives a big kick.

57:12.307 --> 57:15.935
You know, I heard you play
years ago in New York.

57:16.394 --> 57:20.148
Before the war
at the old Dickie Wells Bar.

57:21.149 --> 57:26.029
You were having it up pretty good
with a guy called Johnny Favorite.

57:26.488 --> 57:30.992
Yeah, I vaguely remember.
- You and he were buddies, weren't you?

57:31.451 --> 57:35.205
No, he recorded one of my songs.
Say, are you a dick or a book writer?

57:36.206 --> 57:40.835
Neither. I'm a journalist
and I'm doing this piece

57:41.294 --> 57:44.631
about Johnny
and the Spider Simpson Orchestra.

57:45.089 --> 57:47.926
Spider played them drums
like two jackrabbits fucking!

57:48.802 --> 57:52.180
Haven't got much time. Got to piss,
spit and get back to work.

57:52.639 --> 57:56.684
Try one of those cocktails. Then you can
make the whole thing up as you like.

57:57.143 --> 57:59.813
That's what you usually do, anyway.

58:21.835 --> 58:23.294
I can't even take a piss!

58:23.753 --> 58:27.340
I just wanted to talk about Johnny
Favorite and Evangeline Proudfoot.

58:27.799 --> 58:31.803
I'm too big to go hiding under beds.
I don't know nothing.

58:32.262 --> 58:34.013
I'm only interested in cocktails. Fuck!

58:49.320 --> 58:53.158
What's going on? - Nothing! Mind your
own business. I want to piss!

58:54.784 --> 58:56.161
Get outta here,

58:56.619 --> 58:59.789
or you'll wish your little white ass
was never born.

59:00.248 --> 59:02.417
Please! I've got a thing about chickens.

01:03:04.534 --> 01:03:06.953
End of bullshit time!

01:03:07.412 --> 01:03:09.706
I've had a
good look at you and young Epiphany

01:03:10.498 --> 01:03:13.126
doing your hot shoe number
with the chicken.

01:03:13.585 --> 01:03:15.003
Listen!

01:03:15.461 --> 01:03:18.298
I ain't up on this voodoo shit.
I'm from Brooklyn.

01:03:18.756 --> 01:03:23.136
We ain't all Baptists here.
- What's with this Proudfoot girl?

01:03:23.595 --> 01:03:27.599
She's a mambo priestess, like her mom.
Has been since she was 13.

01:03:28.057 --> 01:03:30.810
When was the last time you saw
Johnny Favorite at a chicken dance?

01:03:31.269 --> 01:03:35.356
He used to run around with Ma mambo.
- I ain't seen him since before the war.

01:03:36.983 --> 01:03:40.445
And the chicken foot in the john?
- It means I got a big mouth.

01:03:40.904 --> 01:03:44.282
It's not big enough.
What's this fucking star

01:03:44.741 --> 01:03:47.118
in your mouth? I'll tell you what.

01:03:48.453 --> 01:03:53.625
I'll give you my hotel number.
Gimme a call if you hear anything.

01:03:55.627 --> 01:03:57.670
You never know.

01:03:58.129 --> 01:04:01.549
Next time you get a delivery of a
chicken foot, you might need help.

01:04:02.008 --> 01:04:07.096
As far as I'm concerned,
any dead chicken is a good chicken.

01:05:55.038 --> 01:05:57.457
Only cops and bad news don't knock.

01:05:57.916 --> 01:05:59.834
Only private dicks sleep late.

01:06:00.543 --> 01:06:05.632
Quite a dream you were having!
- I was on my way to Mandalay.

01:06:08.259 --> 01:06:11.221
Shit! There's some leak up there!

01:06:12.347 --> 01:06:14.933
Here! Is this your name?

01:06:26.194 --> 01:06:28.238
That your hotel?

01:06:28.696 --> 01:06:31.741
You're standing in it, ain't you?
- Your handwriting?

01:06:32.951 --> 01:06:34.369
I think so.

01:06:35.703 --> 01:06:38.414
Then perhaps you can tell us
why we found it in the hand

01:06:38.873 --> 01:06:40.834
of a dead guitar player.

01:06:44.963 --> 01:06:46.297
Toots Sweet is dead?

01:06:49.425 --> 01:06:52.053
This one wasn't so quick,
this one took time.

01:06:52.512 --> 01:06:53.930
How did he die?

01:06:54.639 --> 01:06:58.643
Technically?
Asphyxiation by his own genitalia.

01:06:59.310 --> 01:07:01.396
And not so technically?

01:07:01.855 --> 01:07:04.691
They cut his dick off
and choked him with it.

01:07:05.150 --> 01:07:08.194
Then redecorated his apartment
with his blood.

01:07:08.653 --> 01:07:14.284
When did you see him? - I interviewed
him around 1:00. - About what?

01:07:14.742 --> 01:07:16.244
A missing person.

01:07:17.495 --> 01:07:18.663
Who?

01:07:19.914 --> 01:07:21.791
A guy who took a walk 12 years ago.

01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:25.712
There was a photo of him and Toots.
- Who is the party you're looking for?

01:07:26.171 --> 01:07:29.716
I can't say.
I'm working for a New York lawyer.

01:07:30.175 --> 01:07:32.886
Name?
- Come on, man!

01:07:33.344 --> 01:07:36.389
Winesap!
You want his number, his address?

01:07:36.848 --> 01:07:39.517
Ask Tess Truehart over there,
it's in the book.

01:07:39.976 --> 01:07:44.647
Under "W," genius! - Do you know
Ted Williams, the baseball player?

01:07:51.613 --> 01:07:54.115
Alright, is that it, guys?

01:07:56.367 --> 01:07:57.577
That's it.

01:07:58.995 --> 01:08:03.208
You can go eat lunch,
but don't stroll too far.

01:08:03.666 --> 01:08:05.877
Not until we talk to this lawyer.

01:08:14.886 --> 01:08:16.930
Ever watch the "Mickey Mouse Club?"

01:08:18.973 --> 01:08:21.600
Do you know what today is?

01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:24.312
Today is Wednesday.

01:08:25.313 --> 01:08:27.273
It's "anything can happen" day.

01:09:56.988 --> 01:09:58.281
Hey man, do you want a tune?

01:10:01.201 --> 01:10:03.369
Yeah, I got a tune for you.

01:14:30.804 --> 01:14:32.180
Hiya, boys!

01:14:33.807 --> 01:14:36.935
Same to you.
I'm getting kinda hungry.

01:14:37.393 --> 01:14:39.437
Do you want to sell some of those?

01:14:46.486 --> 01:14:49.489
10 cents a sack.
- Sure, give me a sack.

01:15:15.181 --> 01:15:18.935
Listen good! Margaret Krusemark's old
man wants you on the first train home.

01:15:19.394 --> 01:15:21.229
Take that fucking thing away from me!

01:15:21.688 --> 01:15:25.358
Don't, or the dog will bite
your fucking face clean off.

01:15:51.551 --> 01:15:53.344
What happened to you?

01:15:53.803 --> 01:15:55.722
A dog bit me.

01:15:56.389 --> 01:15:58.183
So, what do you want?

01:15:59.642 --> 01:16:02.020
Right now, I need a laundry.

01:16:04.814 --> 01:16:07.442
Listen, Epiphiny...
- Epiphany.

01:16:08.067 --> 01:16:10.153
There's something I want to ask you.

01:16:10.612 --> 01:16:16.034
The other night I saw you and Toots
boogying with the cock-a-doodle.

01:16:16.701 --> 01:16:18.495
Looked like you were having some party.

01:16:18.953 --> 01:16:21.915
What's your problem?
It's a free country.

01:16:22.373 --> 01:16:25.794
Not for chickens.
- Oh yeah, your thing about chickens.

01:16:26.252 --> 01:16:28.671
Listen, Toots is...

01:16:29.130 --> 01:16:31.508
Toots is dead.
- I know, I heard.

01:16:32.550 --> 01:16:34.636
You set him up.
- No, I didn't.

01:16:35.094 --> 01:16:38.223
You were the only one
that knew I was seeing Toots.

01:16:39.557 --> 01:16:41.976
You sent the
gift-wrapped chicken foot, didn't you?

01:16:42.435 --> 01:16:44.604
Toots had a big mouth.

01:16:45.063 --> 01:16:48.358
I guess he did,
judging by what the cops found in it.

01:16:48.817 --> 01:16:52.862
Quite a cute religion! - Nailing a man
to a cross ain't so cute either!

01:16:53.321 --> 01:16:55.240
You've got to kill the chicken
to make the soup, eh?

01:16:55.698 --> 01:17:00.703
We don't go around murdering people.
What about your Johnny Favorite?

01:17:01.663 --> 01:17:05.917
Now you remember him after all.
- Yes, he was my father.

01:17:12.841 --> 01:17:15.635
I'll pick the baby up later, okay?
- He'll be all right.

01:17:16.094 --> 01:17:20.723
Anything you're holding out,
now is a good time to tell.

01:17:21.182 --> 01:17:22.183
Nothing to tell.

01:17:23.476 --> 01:17:26.146
Johnny never came back from the war.

01:17:27.147 --> 01:17:30.859
Mama waited and Mama died.
Sad and simple.

01:17:32.026 --> 01:17:36.489
There's too many dead bodies
floating around, even for Louisiana.

01:17:37.115 --> 01:17:40.201
I'd tell your old man
to look out for you.

01:17:40.660 --> 01:17:43.371
You do have a husband?
- No.

01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:44.956
No?

01:17:45.665 --> 01:17:47.959
Jesus, you've got beautiful eyes!

01:17:48.793 --> 01:17:50.628
Really.

01:17:51.588 --> 01:17:55.675
The kind of eyes
that tell what's going on inside.

01:17:56.134 --> 01:17:58.636
Right now, you're scared.
- I'll manage.

01:18:01.973 --> 01:18:05.018
Listen...
- Yes, I'll call you if I hear anything.

01:18:08.605 --> 01:18:10.648
Call me if you don't.

01:18:11.941 --> 01:18:12.984
Alright?

01:18:35.673 --> 01:18:38.259
I have a message for you.

01:18:44.307 --> 01:18:45.850
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:19:44.951 --> 01:19:48.913
I'm so glad you could come.
- I didn't know you were in town.

01:19:49.372 --> 01:19:54.252
I'm speaking in Baton Rouge and thought
I'd catch up on your progress.

01:19:54.711 --> 01:19:56.421
I'll tell you,

01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:59.090
the progress ain't too good.

01:19:59.883 --> 01:20:04.554
I've found out a lot of stuff,
but so far... no Johnny Favorite.

01:20:05.972 --> 01:20:10.351
How unfortunate! - All I've got is a
belly full of hocus-pocus and...

01:20:11.394 --> 01:20:12.395
3 stiffs.

01:20:14.481 --> 01:20:16.649
Dead bodies, Mr. Cyphre.

01:20:17.025 --> 01:20:18.026
Murders.

01:20:22.197 --> 01:20:26.743
I got Fowler, Johnny's doctor,
bumped himself off.

01:20:27.285 --> 01:20:29.871
This old voodoo guy Toots Sweet.

01:20:31.039 --> 01:20:34.250
He got choked to death with a part of
the body meant for pissing with...

01:20:35.210 --> 01:20:36.461
This is a church!

01:20:38.922 --> 01:20:44.427
The whole thing has to do with
religion. It's very weird.

01:20:45.553 --> 01:20:47.555
I don't understand it. It's ugly.

01:20:48.056 --> 01:20:52.685
They say there's enough religion to
make men hate each other but not love.

01:20:53.144 --> 01:20:54.187
Do they say that?

01:20:54.646 --> 01:20:59.859
I'll tell you something. There wasn't
much love around for Johnny Favorite.

01:21:00.318 --> 01:21:01.986
He was bad luck!

01:21:02.445 --> 01:21:06.908
It's starting to rub off on me. I'm a
murder suspect already in two cases.

01:21:07.367 --> 01:21:10.995
The police found my name
and my address in Toots Sweets' hand.

01:21:11.454 --> 01:21:16.334
I know, Winesap told me.
You must be careful, Mr. Angel.

01:21:17.210 --> 01:21:19.212
And the third murder?

01:21:19.671 --> 01:21:24.467
I checked out Johnny's old society
girlfriend, Margaret Krusemark.

01:21:24.968 --> 01:21:27.554
Do you know her?
- Vaguely.

01:21:28.012 --> 01:21:31.933
Vaguely? I'm a little fed up
with fucking vaguely.

01:21:32.767 --> 01:21:36.271
"Vaguely" is putting a noose
around my neck and I'm choking, so...

01:21:36.729 --> 01:21:39.357
Did you know her or not?

01:21:40.066 --> 01:21:42.944
I knew about her,
but I never actually knew her.

01:21:43.403 --> 01:21:45.989
Tell you what, she was doing my chart.

01:21:46.447 --> 01:21:49.701
I gave her Johnny's birthday,
February 14th.

01:21:51.035 --> 01:21:55.331
Except someone got to her and
took out their own Valentine's card.

01:21:55.790 --> 01:21:59.502
They slit her open
and cut out her heart.

01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:04.674
I guess she couldn't
predict the future for herself.

01:22:05.133 --> 01:22:07.510
The future isn't what it used to be.

01:22:07.969 --> 01:22:09.888
And your conclusions?
- I haven't any.

01:22:10.346 --> 01:22:13.892
All I know is that Johnny is running
around bumping off everyone he knew.

01:22:14.350 --> 01:22:17.562
And more and more,
it's me who's on the line for it.

01:22:18.021 --> 01:22:20.940
I'm being set up
and it's scaring the shit out of me.

01:22:21.399 --> 01:22:25.487
So why don't you just level with me
and tell me what the fuck is going on?

01:22:26.404 --> 01:22:30.575
Just Johnny Favorite
and the debt that's owed to me.

01:22:31.034 --> 01:22:34.120
I have old-fashioned ideas,
about honour.

01:22:34.579 --> 01:22:37.415
An eye for an eye, things like that.

01:22:39.042 --> 01:22:40.877
Who the fuck are you?

01:22:41.336 --> 01:22:42.587
Watch your language!

01:22:44.547 --> 01:22:48.009
I don't give a fuck,
if this is a church.

01:22:48.468 --> 01:22:50.637
I don't like churches.
- Are you an atheist?

01:22:51.095 --> 01:22:54.098
Yes, I'm from Brooklyn.

01:22:56.684 --> 01:22:59.938
I'll be in town for a day or two,
let me know what else you find,

01:23:00.396 --> 01:23:02.649
and if you need more money...
- No!

01:23:03.107 --> 01:23:06.152
But if I'm not careful,
that 5,000 bucks you gave me could

01:23:06.611 --> 01:23:09.489
buy me a seat on the electric chair.

01:23:48.319 --> 01:23:50.530
Frightened eyes never lie.

01:23:51.531 --> 01:23:53.741
Come on! Come inside!

01:24:01.624 --> 01:24:04.919
Where's your child?
- He's at Mincie's. She'll bring him.

01:24:05.378 --> 01:24:08.465
She's got 14 of her own,
so he'll be okay there.

01:24:08.923 --> 01:24:13.845
You're welcome to stay here,
or I can get you a room.

01:24:14.304 --> 01:24:15.763
No, it's okay.

01:24:16.222 --> 01:24:19.476
I'm going to have a drink. Want one?

01:24:21.644 --> 01:24:23.688
Well, have one anyway.

01:24:27.609 --> 01:24:29.694
I've been thinking...

01:24:30.153 --> 01:24:34.491
What the hell did your mother see in
a guy like Johnny Favorite?

01:24:34.949 --> 01:24:38.828
I don't know. Whatever he had,
it sure stole her heart away.

01:24:39.829 --> 01:24:42.540
To tell you the truth,
the guy was a creep.

01:24:42.999 --> 01:24:45.335
She sure missed him.

01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:51.508
What does a lady see in a guy
who runs around chopping up pigeons?

01:24:51.966 --> 01:24:56.846
They say it's always the bad-asses
who make a girl's heart beat faster.

01:24:59.766 --> 01:25:01.935
Did she ever say anything about him?

01:25:04.813 --> 01:25:07.440
Just two things.
- What?

01:25:09.317 --> 01:25:14.447
That Johnny Favorite was as close to
true evil as she ever wanted to come.

01:25:15.615 --> 01:25:16.950
What else?

01:25:17.784 --> 01:25:19.369
That he was a terrific lover.

01:25:24.833 --> 01:25:26.209
How old are you?

01:25:26.668 --> 01:25:29.045
17.

01:25:31.089 --> 01:25:32.966
Kind of young to have a kid, isn't it?

01:25:33.591 --> 01:25:35.718
Old enough.

01:25:37.387 --> 01:25:40.014
Where did the father go?
- I never knew him.

01:25:40.932 --> 01:25:42.267
I'm sorry.

01:25:44.060 --> 01:25:46.688
I don't know why I took this room.

01:25:47.814 --> 01:25:50.942
I can't believe this!

01:25:52.068 --> 01:25:56.906
It was a Bambouche. When spirits
possess you, it's called "chevalier."

01:25:57.282 --> 01:26:00.493
I know that: Chevrolet.

01:26:01.703 --> 01:26:06.749
Chevalier. - That's what I said:
Chevrolet. - Mounted by the gods.

01:26:07.459 --> 01:26:12.046
So the gods got you pregnant?
I understand now. I'm sorry.

01:26:12.505 --> 01:26:14.549
I'm not.
It was the best fuck I ever had.

01:26:36.946 --> 01:26:38.656
Want to dance?

01:26:39.115 --> 01:26:40.742
Here?

01:26:41.201 --> 01:26:42.410
Yes, here.

01:26:47.499 --> 01:26:51.753
I got bit by a dog this morning,
I can't move around.

01:26:53.713 --> 01:26:56.007
You won't feel a thing.

01:26:57.509 --> 01:26:59.135
Alright, I'll dance with you.

01:26:59.886 --> 01:27:02.555
But you've got to promise.
- What's that? - No chickens!

01:30:36.394 --> 01:30:38.563
Alright, I'm coming!

01:30:40.690 --> 01:30:42.859
I should've recognised the knock.

01:30:43.318 --> 01:30:45.862
At least you got a reason
for sleeping late.

01:30:46.321 --> 01:30:50.450
Down here we don't mess with jigaboos.
The colored folks keep to themselves.

01:30:50.909 --> 01:30:54.454
I'm not from down here.
- You cut yourself?

01:30:54.913 --> 01:30:55.914
Dog bit me.

01:30:56.915 --> 01:31:00.460
Somebody called Margaret Krusemark
figure in your missing persons case?

01:31:01.836 --> 01:31:05.423
No, why? - She's dead.
That nigger guitar player of yours,

01:31:05.882 --> 01:31:10.678
he didn't matter a shit. He was into
voodoo, they 86 each other every week.

01:31:11.137 --> 01:31:15.809
But this Krusemark dame, she comes
from a Louisiana money family.

01:31:16.267 --> 01:31:19.062
Two people bumped off in a week,
what's the connection?

01:31:19.521 --> 01:31:21.523
Similar circumstances!

01:31:21.981 --> 01:31:24.400
Did she have her dick cut off too?
- No!

01:31:24.859 --> 01:31:27.612
Some fucker cut her heart out,
neat as a butcher.

01:31:28.071 --> 01:31:31.324
Look, mine's
a missing persons, it's not a murder.

01:31:31.783 --> 01:31:36.287
I want the name of the party you're
looking for. - Talk to the lawyer.

01:31:36.746 --> 01:31:41.543
I did. A fancy mouthpiece, gave me the
same big city shit as you.

01:31:42.335 --> 01:31:46.422
What should I say? Why don't you and
Effie Klinker just fuck off

01:31:46.881 --> 01:31:48.925
and leave me alone?
- You ass-wipe!

01:31:49.384 --> 01:31:52.220
You play jump rope with Louisiana law
and I'm going to stick

01:31:52.679 --> 01:31:55.390
your big city smarts
right up your New York ass.

01:31:56.099 --> 01:32:00.270
This Krusemark was into black magic
and all that shit.

01:32:00.728 --> 01:32:05.942
Nothing is worse for a cop than people
who get killed for nutso reasons.

01:32:07.443 --> 01:32:11.739
Sorry about the mess.
Maybe your nigger can clean it up.

01:32:50.778 --> 01:32:52.530
What are you singing?

01:32:54.365 --> 01:32:58.203
It's by Johnny Favorite.
My mother used to sing it all the time.

01:33:01.790 --> 01:33:02.707
You okay?

01:35:01.242 --> 01:35:02.452
Shit!

01:36:01.516 --> 01:36:03.643
What do you want, Mr. Angel?

01:36:04.102 --> 01:36:07.147
I thought you knew.
- Why should I?

01:36:07.606 --> 01:36:12.360
Two of your morons with a matching
poodle have been chasing me for days.

01:36:14.279 --> 01:36:16.197
I'm looking for Johnny Favorite.

01:36:17.198 --> 01:36:20.785
As far as I know,
that dance band scumbag is dead.

01:36:21.244 --> 01:36:25.081
That dance band scumbag
probably killed your daughter.

01:36:25.540 --> 01:36:29.711
Who is employing you?
- I can't say.

01:36:30.295 --> 01:36:33.048
I'll pay.
- So do they.

01:36:34.299 --> 01:36:39.888
12 years ago, you and your daughter
snatched Favorite from the nut hatch.

01:36:40.472 --> 01:36:45.018
You gave a junkie doctor 25 grand to
pretend Johnny was still there.

01:36:45.477 --> 01:36:47.646
You did a good job until a week ago.

01:36:49.522 --> 01:36:52.317
You used the name Edward Kelley.

01:36:55.028 --> 01:36:59.074
Let's go over here. It's a little
private and you can sample our Gumbo.

01:36:59.532 --> 01:37:04.371
I've got an acid stomach.
Cajun cooking kills me.

01:37:09.834 --> 01:37:13.421
Pity about your stomach!
You'd have enjoyed our Gumbo.

01:37:32.399 --> 01:37:36.611
I was Edward Kelley.
It was me who paid Fowler the 25 grand.

01:37:37.571 --> 01:37:40.073
Did Favorite know you?
- No.

01:37:40.532 --> 01:37:44.494
He acted like a sleep walker. He looked
out of the window at the lights.

01:37:46.079 --> 01:37:50.834
Where were you taking him?
- Times Square. New Years Eve, '43.

01:37:51.334 --> 01:37:54.671
We dropped him off in the crowd,
and he disappeared forever.

01:37:55.130 --> 01:37:57.173
Or so we thought.

01:37:57.632 --> 01:38:00.510
You're telling me you paid 25 grand
for a guy and lost him in a crowd?

01:38:00.969 --> 01:38:02.679
I did it for my daughter.

01:38:03.138 --> 01:38:06.683
Some sort of hocus-pocus she and Johnny
were fooling with. She was obsessed.

01:38:07.142 --> 01:38:09.811
I know,
I found a mummified hand in her room.

01:38:10.270 --> 01:38:14.065
The hand of glory.
It's supposed to open any lock.

01:38:14.524 --> 01:38:18.403
It was the right hand of a murderer, cut
off while his neck was in the noose.

01:38:18.862 --> 01:38:21.239
That's what Margaret believed.

01:38:21.698 --> 01:38:25.911
Black magic! - Black, white, what's the
difference? Margaret was always...

01:38:26.369 --> 01:38:28.788
Evil.
- Evil as a dunghill.

01:38:29.247 --> 01:38:33.585
Everyone speaks about someone else.
Margaret wasn't evil.

01:38:34.044 --> 01:38:38.757
She was a strange kid! She was into
Tarot cards before she could read.

01:38:39.216 --> 01:38:42.886
Who got her started?
- Some maid, or governess, who knows.

01:38:43.345 --> 01:38:46.723
Everything you tell me
is a crock of shit!

01:38:47.182 --> 01:38:48.975
You got her started!

01:38:49.434 --> 01:38:54.272
You're a devil worshipper! - The Prince
of Darkness protects the powerful.

01:38:54.731 --> 01:38:56.733
Shit!
- I can't help if you don't believe it.

01:38:57.192 --> 01:39:01.279
Come straight with me, you slime-bag,
or I'll save the state an execution!

01:39:01.738 --> 01:39:04.783
I introduced
Johnny Favorite to my daughter.

01:39:05.242 --> 01:39:09.454
I watched him conjure up Lucifer in my
home. He was deeper in it than me.

01:39:09.913 --> 01:39:12.832
He made a pact with Satan.
He sold his soul.

01:39:13.291 --> 01:39:16.378
You expect me to swallow that?
- I don't give a damn!

01:39:16.836 --> 01:39:20.257
That's a crock of shit,
you lying toad!

01:39:20.715 --> 01:39:24.511
He sold his soul for stardom.
- For stardom?

01:39:24.970 --> 01:39:27.264
Satan rose from the depths.

01:39:27.722 --> 01:39:30.517
But he tried to outwit
the Prince of Darkness.

01:39:30.976 --> 01:39:34.229
When he made it big,
he tried to duck out of it.

01:39:34.688 --> 01:39:36.189
That's a crock of shit!

01:39:36.648 --> 01:39:40.485
Johnny found an obscure rite in an
ancient manuscript. He needed a victim.

01:39:40.944 --> 01:39:44.155
Someone his own age. - Why?
- To steal their soul.

01:39:44.614 --> 01:39:47.200
Toots and Johnny
picked up a young soldier.

01:39:47.659 --> 01:39:48.743
Who?
- Just a soldier

01:39:49.619 --> 01:39:51.121
celebrating New Year's Eve in New York.

01:39:52.497 --> 01:39:55.750
They took him back to Johnny's hotel,
where they had the ceremony.

01:39:56.209 --> 01:39:57.294
What ceremony?

01:39:57.752 --> 01:40:02.632
The boy was bound naked on a rubber mat,
there were complicated incantations.

01:40:03.091 --> 01:40:05.135
A pentacle was branded on his chest.

01:40:05.594 --> 01:40:07.262
Margaret gave Johnny a virgin dagger.

01:40:07.721 --> 01:40:10.765
He sliced the boy clean open
and ate his heart.

01:40:12.100 --> 01:40:15.312
It was still beating
when he wolfed it down.

01:40:16.980 --> 01:40:19.065
Johnny wanted to become that soldier.

01:40:19.524 --> 01:40:21.860
Before he had worked it out,
he was drafted,

01:40:22.319 --> 01:40:25.405
injured and sent home
without even knowing who he was.

01:40:25.864 --> 01:40:27.741
Who was the boy?

01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:32.996
Only Johnny knew. He put the dog tags
in a vase and gave it to Margaret.

01:40:33.455 --> 01:40:35.665
It was Margaret's plan
to drop him off in Times Square.

01:40:36.124 --> 01:40:38.877
The last place he remembered
before it happened.

01:40:43.340 --> 01:40:47.302
He needed a victim.
Someone his own age.

01:40:49.304 --> 01:40:52.098
To steal their soul.

01:40:52.933 --> 01:40:57.020
He sliced the boy clean open
and he ate his heart.

01:40:57.479 --> 01:40:59.397
Who was the boy?

01:41:00.607 --> 01:41:03.443
Johnny wanted to be the soldier.

01:41:05.278 --> 01:41:09.157
Maybe he gained the guy's soul,
but he still looked like Johnny to me.

01:43:31.716 --> 01:43:33.468
I know who I am!

01:43:54.281 --> 01:43:55.782
Alas...

01:43:58.869 --> 01:44:03.081
How terrible is wisdom if it brings
no profit to the wise, Johnny.

01:44:04.207 --> 01:44:06.001
Louis Cyphre...

01:44:08.295 --> 01:44:09.629
"Lucifer!"

01:44:12.007 --> 01:44:14.801
Even your name is a dime store joke.

01:44:15.385 --> 01:44:19.055
"Mephistopheles" is
such a mouthful in Manhattan, Johnny.

01:44:19.514 --> 01:44:21.725
Do you think posing as the devil,

01:44:22.183 --> 01:44:26.229
just because it scared
a superstitious old guitar player,

01:44:26.688 --> 01:44:29.482
and that witch,
and that nutty old man,

01:44:30.150 --> 01:44:34.946
do you think it's going to scare me?
It ain't, because I know who I am.

01:44:35.822 --> 01:44:39.868
You killed them,
and you're trying to pin it on me.

01:44:40.452 --> 01:44:42.495
I know who I am.

01:44:43.330 --> 01:44:46.791
If I had cloven hooves and a tail,
would you be more convinced?

01:44:48.543 --> 01:44:50.378
You're crazy.

01:44:50.837 --> 01:44:53.673
I know who I am.
You're trying to frame me.

01:44:54.424 --> 01:44:55.717
You're trying to frame me.

01:44:56.176 --> 01:45:00.722
I know who I am. You murdered them
people! I never killed nobody!

01:45:01.389 --> 01:45:03.725
I didn't kill Fowler,

01:45:06.144 --> 01:45:08.104
I didn't kill Toots,

01:45:08.563 --> 01:45:11.483
and I didn't kill Margaret or Krusemark.

01:45:11.942 --> 01:45:14.110
I killed no one.

01:45:14.569 --> 01:45:17.530
I'm afraid you did, Johnny.
- My name's not Johnny!

01:45:17.989 --> 01:45:22.369
All killed by your own hand.
Guided by me, naturally.

01:45:22.869 --> 01:45:27.499
You were doomed from the moment
you slit that young boy in half.

01:45:28.667 --> 01:45:33.505
You've been living on borrowed time and
another man's memories for 12 years.

01:45:37.884 --> 01:45:42.138
I want to tell Winesap, he knows!
- He's dead.

01:45:43.348 --> 01:45:44.391
Nasty accident!

01:45:46.601 --> 01:45:51.815
Don't worry, no one will mourn one less
lawyer. Death's everywhere these days.

01:45:54.234 --> 01:45:57.988
But what gives
human life its worth, anyway?

01:45:58.738 --> 01:46:01.658
Because someone loves it, hates it.

01:46:02.117 --> 01:46:06.288
The flesh is weak.
Only the soul is immortal.

01:46:11.918 --> 01:46:14.546
And yours belongs to me!

01:46:19.467 --> 01:46:21.261
I know who I am.

01:46:25.348 --> 01:46:28.602
That's it Johnny, take a good look!

01:46:29.644 --> 01:46:32.856
However cleverly you
sneak up on the mirror, your reflection

01:46:33.315 --> 01:46:37.110
always looks you straight in the eye.
- I know who I am.

01:47:07.891 --> 01:47:09.893
I know who I am!

01:48:22.257 --> 01:48:23.884
Why did you come back?

01:48:34.227 --> 01:48:36.104
I live here.

01:48:37.772 --> 01:48:39.316
Who is she?

01:48:41.735 --> 01:48:45.071
She ain't: Angel, Harold.

01:48:47.657 --> 01:48:49.534
She's my daughter.

01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:52.871
Bullshit! Who is she?

01:48:54.039 --> 01:48:57.042
Epiphany Proudfoot.

01:48:57.834 --> 01:49:00.337
She stayed here for a little while.

01:49:02.881 --> 01:49:07.427
Long enough for you to kill her?
Or ain't that your gun up her snatch?

01:49:25.153 --> 01:49:26.947
You're going to burn for this.

01:49:29.866 --> 01:49:31.243
I know.

01:49:34.287 --> 01:49:35.914
In hell!
