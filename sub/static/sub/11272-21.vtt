WEBVTT

00:09.001 --> 00:12.085
Fine. lt's been a pleasure serving you.

00:12.254 --> 00:16.962
Wait a minute. ls this for me?
Wow, a quarter!

00:17.133 --> 00:19.588
He left me a whole quarter.

00:19.760 --> 00:23.423
Considering the great service
l gave him, l was expecting a big tip,

00:23.595 --> 00:26.168
but nothing of this magnitude.

00:26.348 --> 00:30.759
Thanks to him l am on Easy Street.
Now l'm going to retire.

00:30.934 --> 00:34.267
All right. l'll give you some more, OK?
Here.

00:34.437 --> 00:38.516
- You have change of a ten?
- Yeah. Now beat it.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074

01:53.537 --> 01:57.034
Everybody,
you better stay on my good side today.

01:57.205 --> 02:01.831
Cliff, l've looked at you from every angle.
There is no good side.

02:02.001 --> 02:04.788
What's the problem there, Cliffie?

02:04.962 --> 02:08.459
A new couple moved in next door
to me and Ma.

02:08.630 --> 02:13.541
They're loud, noisy, up till all hours
playing their bebop music,

02:13.718 --> 02:18.758
automobile parts strewn all over
the yard. Nothing l can use.

02:18.930 --> 02:21.800
Why don't you have a word
with these people?

02:21.973 --> 02:25.057
They're not that type of people.

02:25.226 --> 02:29.637
lt'll only lead to a fight
and you know what l'm liable to do.

02:29.812 --> 02:32.896
Yeah, wet yourself.

02:36.067 --> 02:40.479
My God! That's my boss.
He saw me slip out early.

02:41.237 --> 02:45.447
- You got here the same time as always.
- l know. l always leave early.

02:47.159 --> 02:50.741
l refuse to be one of those cowardly
clock-watchers.

02:50.912 --> 02:55.074
As soon as my supervisor turns
his head, l slip out the heating duct.

02:57.082 --> 03:01.458
- How would he know you're here?
- The company's full of spies.

03:01.627 --> 03:06.003
They know everything about you.
They even keep track of your sex habits.

03:06.172 --> 03:09.541
Thank God l don't have any.

03:10.467 --> 03:13.136
He's coming this way.
Cover for me.

03:13.303 --> 03:18.343
Wait a minute!
Excuse me, wasn't that Norm Peterson?

03:18.515 --> 03:22.512
No, there's no Norm Peterson here.
l don't even know a Norm Peterson.

03:22.684 --> 03:26.930
Are you sure? The man that just ran
into the men's room?

03:27.104 --> 03:31.350
Absolutely not. Probably somebody
that looked like Norm Peterson...

03:31.524 --> 03:34.608
- ...who l don't know.
- l see.

03:35.403 --> 03:39.316
And what's this on the floor?

03:41.406 --> 03:47.359
Foam insulation from our heating duct.
My information is correct.

03:54.249 --> 03:57.368
Peterson, are you in here?

04:03.548 --> 04:06.916
- Were you talking to me?
- What are you doing in there?

04:07.092 --> 04:10.376
Sir, this is close to being an invasion
of privacy.

04:10.553 --> 04:14.300
But l want to talk to you. l'll wait outside.

04:14.473 --> 04:18.599
No, sir. l know what you're probably
going to do to me

04:18.767 --> 04:23.594
and this does seem like
the appropriate place for it.

04:23.772 --> 04:28.596
All right. Peterson, we've been making
some changes in the company.

04:28.774 --> 04:32.724
Starting tomorrow, we want you to be
our corporate killer.

04:34.529 --> 04:36.817
The guy who fires people?

04:36.990 --> 04:43.072
We decided that terminating employees
puts too much stress on our executives.

04:43.243 --> 04:46.279
- We think you'll be perfect.
- Why me?

04:46.454 --> 04:50.367
Studies have shown
that it's particularly humiliating

04:50.540 --> 04:55.617
when you're fired by somebody
who is clearly superior to yourself.

04:55.795 --> 04:59.293
And that just wouldn't be the case
with you, Norman.

04:59.464 --> 05:02.417
You're just an ordinary Joe.

05:02.592 --> 05:06.884
As a matter of fact,
we checked out your home life.

05:07.053 --> 05:11.760
You have absolutely nothing
anyone could possibly envy or resent.

05:11.931 --> 05:17.090
l'm honoured, sir. But this sounds
like a horrible job, frankly.

05:17.268 --> 05:22.308
lt's a 300% raise
and if you don't take it, you're fired.

05:22.481 --> 05:27.520
l will have you know that l cannot be
bought and l cannot be threatened,

05:27.693 --> 05:31.771
but you put the two together
and l'm your man.

05:35.615 --> 05:41.487
Have you given any thought to using
some form of natural childbirth this time?

05:41.662 --> 05:45.990
- l always use the Le Mans method.
- No, you mean Lamaze.

05:46.164 --> 05:50.492
No, Le Mans. l scream like a Ferrari.

05:53.253 --> 05:56.835
- Evening, everybody.
- Norm!

05:57.006 --> 05:59.578
What will you have, Norm?

05:59.758 --> 06:02.628
A glass of whatever comes out
of that tap.

06:02.802 --> 06:06.549
- Looks like beer, Norm.
- Call me Mr Lucky.

06:06.721 --> 06:09.840
l'll take another one
for my young friend there.

06:10.015 --> 06:14.475
- So who is your young friend?
- lt's my first assignment, Cliffie.

06:14.644 --> 06:20.099
l was supposed to fire him this morning.
l haven't been able to do it yet.

06:21.024 --> 06:24.806
You've been with the guy all day
and you haven't canned him?

06:24.984 --> 06:28.352
He's such a sweet kid.
l just can't tear his heart out.

06:28.528 --> 06:32.395
- Can l do it, please?
- Do you mind?

06:32.574 --> 06:36.700
l know what you're talking about.
lt's always hard to fire people.

06:36.868 --> 06:41.446
l always give my waitresses
the benefit of a severance boink.

06:43.372 --> 06:46.408
That or the money equivalent,

06:46.584 --> 06:48.660
$1 .1 4.

06:48.836 --> 06:53.661
As l recall, you were always
after an advance.

06:53.838 --> 06:57.172
Oh, Sam. You're always bringing that up,

06:57.342 --> 07:00.756
trying to relive
those few precious weeks

07:00.927 --> 07:05.718
with the only woman you ever dated
who knew how to spell your name.

07:06.974 --> 07:12.096
As l recall, you used to spell it
E-X-T-A-S-Y.

07:14.854 --> 07:19.064
You got the ''X'' right.
And it's going to stay that way.

07:19.231 --> 07:21.770
Could we move on to something
more interesting

07:21.943 --> 07:24.647
than your star-crossed romance?

07:24.820 --> 07:28.484
What could be more interesting
than another gripping episode of

07:28.656 --> 07:31.573
''The Young and the Chestless''?

07:37.412 --> 07:40.532
So when are you
going to talk to the guy?

07:40.707 --> 07:43.790
l've been struggling with it all day,
Sammy.

07:43.959 --> 07:48.833
l was going to tell him at lunch, but we
were enjoying ourselves so much.

07:49.004 --> 07:52.538
So l thought l'd take him to a movie,
try to get him relaxed.

07:52.715 --> 07:58.918
- You couldn't tell him there, either?
- No, but l came close at the ball game.

08:00.887 --> 08:05.429
Norman, as you know,
no one is more sensitive than l.

08:05.599 --> 08:10.759
And l say putting it off
is of no value to you or the boy.

08:12.855 --> 08:15.772
l guess you're right.

08:18.775 --> 08:23.401
Thanks for the beer, Mr Peterson.
l sure have had a good time today.

08:23.571 --> 08:27.153
lt's great to get away
from that old sweat shop, isn't it?

08:27.324 --> 08:29.363
l love my job.

08:29.533 --> 08:34.527
The five months l've had it
have been the best of my life.

08:34.705 --> 08:37.989
- lsn't that exaggerating a bit, Billy?
- Not at all.

08:38.164 --> 08:42.162
Ever since l can remember
l've dreamed of being an accountant.

08:42.335 --> 08:47.209
From the age of six l did odd jobs
to put myself through college.

08:47.380 --> 08:50.962
Now that l have it,
l've got the world at my feet.

08:51.132 --> 08:55.425
l just put a down payment on a house.
lt was more than we wanted,

08:55.594 --> 09:00.090
but escrow closed today
so there's no turning back now.

09:00.264 --> 09:04.095
Besides, with my wife pregnant,
we're going to need the room.

09:04.267 --> 09:06.759
Your...

09:07.686 --> 09:10.889
My wife and l are trying to have
a baby, actually.

09:11.065 --> 09:16.686
That's great! Our kids are going to play
together at the company picnic.

09:16.859 --> 09:20.691
- l don't think so, Billy.
- Why not?

09:20.864 --> 09:23.614
Because you're fired.

09:24.657 --> 09:30.077
- l'm fired?
- lt's not your fault. You're history.

09:30.244 --> 09:34.158
lt's the damn company.
They're cutting back all over the place.

09:34.331 --> 09:38.957
You're a good accountant.
l'm so sorry.

09:39.127 --> 09:42.079
l can't believe it.

09:42.253 --> 09:46.001
lt's not fair! You're so damn young.

09:46.173 --> 09:49.422
That's right.
l've got that going for me.

09:49.592 --> 09:54.466
- l'll find something else.
- ln this job market? Good luck.

09:56.305 --> 10:00.633
There, there, Mr Peterson.
Don't worry about me. l'll be just fine.

10:00.809 --> 10:05.553
l'm going to make you happy
and proud again.

10:05.728 --> 10:09.014
Are you going to be OK?

10:09.190 --> 10:12.106
Come on, show me a big smile.

10:12.275 --> 10:15.395
Come on. Come on.

10:17.153 --> 10:19.859
Attaboy.

10:23.325 --> 10:27.654
Stand up here.
Get him a beer there, Diane.

10:31.039 --> 10:34.289
So how did it go, Norm?

10:36.126 --> 10:41.463
Damn company! What do they know
about the pride in a young wife's eye?

10:41.629 --> 10:46.789
The unborn child
and a boy's love of a calculator?

10:47.760 --> 10:52.255
- Norman, stop torturing yourself.
- And us.

10:57.433 --> 11:01.893
l guess Billy Richter's not going
to be the only one without a job.

11:02.062 --> 11:06.604
l'm not cut out to be a corporate killer.

11:06.774 --> 11:12.395
l watched you with that young man.
l've never seen anything like that.

11:12.570 --> 11:16.815
Hey, pal, this is the 1 980s.
lt's OK for a man to cry.

11:16.989 --> 11:21.780
- Thanks, buddy.
- You'd never catch me doing it.

11:21.951 --> 11:26.826
Maybe a manly tear or two,
but never blubbering.

11:30.082 --> 11:34.494
lt's a policy at Talbert lnternational
to send a representative

11:34.668 --> 11:38.001
to check on how employees
handle new assignments.

11:38.172 --> 11:42.548
l've been following you around all day.

11:42.717 --> 11:47.212
How did you like Rice's catch
in the third inning?

11:47.387 --> 11:50.422
That was a great catch.

11:50.596 --> 11:54.973
l guess you'll tell them to find
another killer. l'm relieved, actually.

11:55.141 --> 11:58.593
You made that man feel
that he was fired

11:58.770 --> 12:02.718
from a sensitive, caring company.
lt was brilliant.

12:02.898 --> 12:08.021
l'm going to recommend that they give
you that corner office on the third floor.

12:08.193 --> 12:13.068
- lsn't that Mr Peabody's office?
- Not after you talk with him tomorrow.

12:22.245 --> 12:26.871
l've had it! Those neighbours
have pushed me too far this time.

12:27.041 --> 12:31.167
- What happened now, Clifford?
- Last night they had a party.

12:31.336 --> 12:35.332
Cars parked all over the block,
loud music and who knows what else.

12:35.505 --> 12:38.078
And all this on a school night.

12:38.257 --> 12:41.839
lt's time they found out what you get
when you cross a Clavin.

12:42.009 --> 12:45.592
Someone crossed one
with a chicken and got you.

12:45.763 --> 12:47.801
l beg your pardon?

12:47.972 --> 12:52.965
You shoot your mouth off about this guy,
but you don't do anything.

12:53.143 --> 12:57.056
- You're afraid to stand up to him.
- l'm not afraid of anything.

12:57.230 --> 13:02.055
One of these days l'll tell that jerk
exactly what l think of him.

13:02.232 --> 13:05.601
All right, here you go.

13:07.445 --> 13:11.821
- Write him a letter.
- You don't think l will?

13:11.990 --> 13:15.690
''Howdy, neighbour.
Please don't take this the wrong way...''

13:15.867 --> 13:19.117
Give me that! ''Howdy, neighbour''!

13:19.286 --> 13:22.074
Let me do this.

13:23.665 --> 13:27.614
''Dear vile, scurvy rat,

13:27.793 --> 13:31.625
''whose existence stinks up the planet...''

13:31.797 --> 13:34.368
l guess that is a bit stronger.

13:35.423 --> 13:37.961
Where's Norm?

13:38.134 --> 13:42.260
He's in the back room dropping the axe
on his latest victim.

13:49.101 --> 13:51.139
lt'll be all right.

13:51.310 --> 13:55.058
l'll find another job...some day.

13:55.229 --> 13:58.099
You promise?

13:58.273 --> 14:01.725
l promise. Now buck up.

14:08.448 --> 14:10.984
That man is a prince.

14:11.867 --> 14:16.362
Norman, why do you keep putting
yourself through this?

14:16.537 --> 14:19.620
You must be emotionally drained
at the end of the day.

14:19.789 --> 14:24.616
Yeah, l am, but l'm good at it.

14:24.793 --> 14:29.583
l finally found something in life
that l'm good at. Pity.

14:31.381 --> 14:34.749
Now we just got to finish it off
with a real doozy.

14:34.926 --> 14:38.756
Does he have any disabilities
you can make fun of?

14:38.928 --> 14:41.632
His wife is not particularly handsome.

14:41.805 --> 14:47.143
Good, good.
''Bark hello to your wife for me.''

14:49.644 --> 14:53.262
''Yours in disgust.'' Sign that.

14:54.315 --> 14:58.892
l'll sign it with pleasure and l'll mail this
at my earliest convenience.

14:59.069 --> 15:05.864
- lt's going out in today's mail.
- Good, good. Glad to hear it.

15:06.032 --> 15:11.653
Look, Clavin, just think of this
as your ticket out of Weenietown.

15:12.619 --> 15:17.364
- l made that trip a long time ago.
- But they threw you out at Dinkville.

15:19.166 --> 15:24.159
Norm, your office called.
They're sending over a John Parker.

15:24.337 --> 15:29.045
Another one?
Last one of the day, l guess.

15:29.216 --> 15:33.508
Let's see what we got here.
John Parker.

15:34.594 --> 15:37.760
35 years with the company, Sam.

15:37.930 --> 15:42.092
He's a widower,
supports sickly parents.

15:42.267 --> 15:45.053
Three foster children.

15:45.227 --> 15:48.180
So sad, so sad.

15:48.979 --> 15:54.185
- Afternoon, Sam. How are we today?
- Fine, Walt. How are you doing?

15:54.358 --> 15:59.482
lt hasn't been an easy day,
but any day l carry the US mail

15:59.654 --> 16:03.271
l count myself a lucky
and useful human being.

16:04.741 --> 16:08.571
- Are all you guys like this?
- Like what?

16:09.161 --> 16:11.698
Never mind.

16:11.871 --> 16:15.619
Hold on a sec, Walt,
l've got some outgoing mail here.

16:15.790 --> 16:19.040
How do you like that?
l just talked to Ma.

16:19.210 --> 16:24.120
Our neighbour's cleaning up his yard.
He would've gotten to it sooner,

16:24.297 --> 16:29.372
but he's been in training for the World
Kick Boxing Championship.

16:29.551 --> 16:33.714
lt's good l found out
before that letter was mailed.

16:33.887 --> 16:37.385
That's excellent use of the nine-digit
zip code, Sam.

16:37.557 --> 16:41.553
Consider these letters in the hands
of the addressees.

16:41.726 --> 16:44.726
Hold on there.

16:44.896 --> 16:49.640
Twitchell, isn't it?
Clavin, South Central Branch, SCB.

16:49.816 --> 16:52.769
Oh, right.

16:52.943 --> 16:56.691
You got a letter in that bag
that l don't need mailed.

16:56.862 --> 16:59.613
l'd appreciate it if l could have it back.

16:59.781 --> 17:04.156
- Sorry.
- What do you mean ''sorry''?

17:04.326 --> 17:09.117
Any letter on my person
for the express purpose of delivery

17:09.288 --> 17:13.154
receives the same sanctity
as in any US Mail receptacle.

17:13.332 --> 17:16.415
But this is a very personal,
important matter to me.

17:16.585 --> 17:20.712
You know the rules.
Hey, that's my bag!

17:20.880 --> 17:23.833
That's a Federal offence, you know.

17:29.302 --> 17:31.757
Get out of here!

17:31.929 --> 17:35.761
That's Clavin. Clavin with a ''C'', right?

17:35.933 --> 17:39.680
- You're in trouble.
- You're in trouble!

17:39.853 --> 17:44.478
- They're going to have your bags.
- Your mother's a bag.

17:45.481 --> 17:50.770
Put a uniform on some guys,
it turns them right into a fascist.

17:50.943 --> 17:57.027
l wouldn't be a bit surprised if that guy
had deep sexual problems.

18:03.994 --> 18:07.363
Norm is sleeping like a baby.

18:07.539 --> 18:10.907
A baby with a licence to kill.

18:11.083 --> 18:16.040
l guess this job is taking its toll.
l wonder what he's dreaming about?

18:16.211 --> 18:19.995
He's probably dreaming about
what every man dreams about.

18:20.173 --> 18:23.791
ln your case that would be me.

18:23.968 --> 18:28.759
l hardly think that Norm is dreaming
about you.

18:30.681 --> 18:33.846
l stand corrected.

18:36.226 --> 18:40.010
- You OK?
- l'm fine.

18:41.230 --> 18:45.226
Strangest dream.
lt was so weird, Sam.

18:45.399 --> 18:49.645
lt was really dark, you know?
And cold and eerie.

18:49.819 --> 18:54.564
lt was out in the middle of nowhere,
but it was definitely somewhere.

18:56.783 --> 18:59.273
There was this line of accountants.

18:59.451 --> 19:03.911
lt was my job to make them
go through a pair of elevator doors.

19:04.080 --> 19:07.199
Going down.

19:22.635 --> 19:24.758
One by one they went,

19:24.929 --> 19:28.711
falling screaming into a bottomless pit.

19:35.395 --> 19:40.636
There's this accountant wearing
a blindfold. l went up to him.

19:54.909 --> 19:58.609
No, wait. l'm just demonstrating.

19:58.786 --> 20:02.831
Norman, don't you see
what this dream means?

20:02.999 --> 20:05.570
A very precious part of you

20:05.750 --> 20:09.249
feels as if it's being destroyed
by this job.

20:09.420 --> 20:12.787
The burden of your guilt is insupportable.

20:12.964 --> 20:16.877
l never said l was in love with this job,
OK?

20:17.049 --> 20:20.549
l think it stinks.
But it is important.

20:20.720 --> 20:24.847
These guys would all be fired anyway.
l provide a service.

20:25.015 --> 20:28.264
l'm helping them through
a painful experience.

20:28.434 --> 20:32.762
Norman, these executives
are having you do their dirty work.

20:32.937 --> 20:36.885
- You are their Judas goat.
- Lighten up, will ya, Diane?

20:37.065 --> 20:39.685
You should have more pride

20:39.859 --> 20:44.021
than to do repugnant tasks for people
at their bidding.

20:44.195 --> 20:47.444
You want to wipe up that bar sweat
there?

21:01.415 --> 21:05.116
- Can l get you something?
- No.

21:06.961 --> 21:10.412
- Are you OK?
- No.

21:10.589 --> 21:15.582
Norm Peterson invited me
for a beer at Cheers.

21:16.678 --> 21:20.840
- He's sitting down right over there.
- So that's him?

21:31.938 --> 21:35.472
Hi. You must be John Parker.
Norm Peterson here.

21:35.648 --> 21:37.440
l know.

21:37.609 --> 21:41.688
lt's really terrible what you have
to do to me, isn't it?

21:41.862 --> 21:44.981
- You know why you're here?
- Everybody knows about you.

21:45.156 --> 21:48.359
Then l guess there's nothing left
to say.

21:48.533 --> 21:53.075
What do you mean?
Where's my sympathy?

21:53.246 --> 21:57.242
Where's the caring?
Where's the tears?

21:57.415 --> 22:02.040
- l do feel bad for you, John.
- Doesn't look like it.

22:03.461 --> 22:07.328
Honestly, John, l feel just awful.

22:14.302 --> 22:17.053
You've foster children, l believe?

22:17.220 --> 22:21.549
Yes. One of them needs braces.

22:27.479 --> 22:34.014
l would rather have somebody fire me
honestly than fake sentiment.

22:34.192 --> 22:38.733
You hide your true feelings
behind crocodile tears.

22:38.904 --> 22:42.770
John, listen, wait a second.
Let me try again, John.

22:43.824 --> 22:46.397
Sickly parents.

22:51.537 --> 22:53.695
l'm dry as a bone.

22:53.873 --> 22:57.158
Do you know what's happening to you,
Norman?

22:57.333 --> 23:02.160
- You're becoming callous and hard.
- Yeah, l know.

23:03.254 --> 23:06.290
Give me the phone and a beer.

23:08.300 --> 23:10.873
- What are you doing?
- Quitting.

23:11.928 --> 23:15.343
l'm calling Mr Simpson
and telling him l'm resigning.

23:15.514 --> 23:20.340
l'm going to let the bosses do their own
dirty work for a change.

23:20.517 --> 23:23.885
Mr Simpson?
This is Norm Peterson, sir.

23:24.062 --> 23:27.643
We really have to have a...
Hello?

23:27.815 --> 23:33.317
He screamed and hung up.
l'll try him again.

23:36.821 --> 23:40.687
ls this Mr Simpson's secretary?
This is Norm Peterson.

23:40.866 --> 23:44.032
We seem to have been... Hello?

23:46.412 --> 23:50.704
You see what's happening here,
don't you?

23:50.873 --> 23:56.910
This is amazing. Why don't l just give
Mr Hecht a little call?

23:57.086 --> 24:01.414
Why don't l tell him how good
the little plan is going?

24:03.298 --> 24:07.959
Mr Hecht, this is Norm Peterson.

24:08.305 --> 24:14.474
