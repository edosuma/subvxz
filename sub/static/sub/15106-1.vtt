<i>I turned my eyes to lunatic skies
of red destruction</i>

03:05.410 --> 03:08.670
<i>Sunrise and morning empty</i>

03:08.830 --> 03:11.960
<i>Hide my head</i>

03:12.130 --> 03:14.800
<i>I've got to find a direction to follow</i>

03:14.960 --> 03:17.720
<i>Something that's mine
not something I borrowed</i>

03:17.880 --> 03:23.100
<i>Each day I wait heavy's the weight on me</i>

03:23.260 --> 03:24.600
<i>Find it</i>

03:24.760 --> 03:26.670
<i>I've got to find it</i>

03:27.730 --> 03:29.650
<i>Get me behind it</i>

03:30.810 --> 03:33.270
<i>Someplace for me</i>

03:34.230 --> 03:35.190
<i>Find it</i>

03:35.650 --> 03:36.570
<i>Find it</i>

03:36.820 --> 03:37.950
<i>Find it</i>

03:38.240 --> 03:41.700
<i>Find it in me</i>

03:45.370 --> 03:47.200
<i>Not even released from wanting you</i>

03:47.370 --> 03:50.580
<i>You don't satisfy me enough today</i>

03:50.750 --> 03:55.920
<i>Time it's too near
when I will be gone away</i>

03:56.130 --> 03:58.880
<i>Wearing a collar of bright crimson</i>

03:59.050 --> 04:01.470
<i>Dressed in a long black wedding gown</i>

04:01.630 --> 04:06.960
<i>I've got to find my answers on my own</i>

04:07.140 --> 04:08.350
<i>Find it</i>

04:09.100 --> 04:10.940
<i>I've got to find it</i>

04:11.560 --> 04:13.610
<i>Get me behind it</i>

04:14.060 --> 04:18.180
<i>Someplace for me</i>

04:18.360 --> 04:22.240
<i>I turned my eyes to lunatic skies
of red destruction</i>

04:22.410 --> 04:25.620
<i>Sunrise and morning empty</i>

04:25.870 --> 04:28.660
<i>Hide my head</i>

04:28.830 --> 04:29.870
<i>Find it</i>

04:30.290 --> 04:35.750
A disgrace. Absolutely disgusting.

04:37.500 --> 04:39.540
I'd like to cut that.

04:39.920 --> 04:41.300
<i>Find it</i>

04:41.510 --> 04:42.760
<i>Find it</i>

04:43.130 --> 04:44.290
<i>Find it</i>

04:44.550 --> 04:45.800
<i>Find it</i>

04:46.010 --> 04:47.220
<i>Find it</i>

04:49.930 --> 04:51.270
That was great, girls.

04:51.480 --> 04:55.190
But rock'n'roll is not my cup of poison.

04:55.400 --> 04:59.110
I remember when I was a young man....

05:01.610 --> 05:03.450
I just don't understand those kids.

05:03.650 --> 05:07.520
Well, if you had to listen
to their music....

05:07.700 --> 05:11.580
Did you see those chaperones?
They were built like Khrushchev.

05:11.750 --> 05:14.420
They weren't as bad as those D.O.M.s.

05:14.750 --> 05:16.920
I got the money.

05:17.130 --> 05:20.710
- 300 bucks.
- One more high-school hop and I split.

05:20.960 --> 05:24.290
Hey, don't bogart the joint, friends.

05:24.510 --> 05:27.970
Cool it, man. I need it more than you.

05:33.140 --> 05:39.270
I don't know. Maybe all you need is love.

05:41.440 --> 05:46.240
Casey, let's split. The principal's gonna
hit me with a couple caps of acid.

05:46.450 --> 05:49.830
- You coming?
- Yeah.

05:53.910 --> 05:57.160
Do you believe those kids,
making it all the time?

05:57.330 --> 06:02.450
Don't get so upset, Casey.
You know how Kelly is.

06:11.430 --> 06:14.310
- Are you trying to make love to me?
- Hell, no.

06:14.520 --> 06:17.440
- Then what are you trying to do?
- I'm trying not to.

06:17.810 --> 06:21.900
Well, if you wanna make love,
then let's make love.

06:22.110 --> 06:23.150
Here?

06:23.980 --> 06:25.850
No, in L.A.

06:26.070 --> 06:27.660
- L.A.?
- Where is that?

06:27.910 --> 06:29.530
- We'd get crushed.
- No.

06:29.780 --> 06:32.080
- Smog. Can't see.
- Climb a tall tree.

06:32.330 --> 06:33.790
- Lousy traffic.
- Love to walk.

06:34.040 --> 06:35.410
- No culture.
- Grooves.

06:35.660 --> 06:37.530
- Cold and cruel.
- Swimming pools.

06:37.790 --> 06:39.630
- Phony city.
- It's so pretty.

06:39.880 --> 06:41.750
- Religious nuts.
- Takes all kinds.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.050
- Noisy. Noisy.
- Soul-beat brother.

06:44.300 --> 06:45.760
- Tinsel town.
- Solid city.

06:46.010 --> 06:48.140
- Gaudy. Ugly.
- Gassy. Classy.

06:48.380 --> 06:50.170
- Cheap anyhow
- Yeah, like wow!

06:50.430 --> 06:51.970
- Very dirty.
- Simon-pure.

06:52.180 --> 06:54.180
- Dull scene.
- My dream.

06:54.390 --> 06:55.890
- Square, hey?
- No way!

06:56.100 --> 06:57.640
- Sick and low.
- Living show.

06:57.890 --> 07:00.010
- It's got no class.
- Nothing but.

07:00.230 --> 07:02.770
- Empty. No heart.
- Full, sweetheart.

07:02.980 --> 07:04.530
- It's a no-talent town.
- Don't put it down.

07:04.780 --> 07:06.360
- Junkie heaven.
- Not for me.

07:06.610 --> 07:08.320
- Dishonest clowns.
- Sincere, you'll see.

07:08.490 --> 07:11.370
- Perverts. Fruits.
- Swingers. Kooks.

07:11.570 --> 07:14.030
- Obvious. Stinks.
- Full-length minks.

07:14.240 --> 07:16.070
- All strangers.
- Not all.

07:16.290 --> 07:17.710
- Like who?
- My aunt.

07:17.870 --> 07:19.670
- Since when?
- Since Aunt Susan.

07:19.870 --> 07:21.620
- Oh yeah?
- Rich Aunt Susan.

07:21.830 --> 07:23.240
- Bitch Aunt Susan.
- Got my share.

07:23.460 --> 07:24.800
- Of what?
- The bread.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.330
- Cool head.
- So we go?

07:26.550 --> 07:27.840
So go!

07:28.340 --> 07:31.180
<i>Come with the gentle people</i>

07:31.550 --> 07:34.680
<i>Spread love across the land</i>

07:35.510 --> 07:38.470
<i>Come with the gentle people</i>

07:38.680 --> 07:46.020
<i>We're the only ones who understand</i>

07:46.440 --> 07:49.360
<i>Come with the gentle people</i>

07:49.820 --> 07:53.160
<i>Help us to ride the wave</i>

07:53.620 --> 07:56.790
<i>And let us free the people</i>

07:57.040 --> 08:03.960
<i>Who are on a path who are afraid</i>

08:04.130 --> 08:07.340
<i>Love can be a way of life</i>

08:07.510 --> 08:10.510
<i>If you open up the door</i>

08:11.010 --> 08:14.430
<i>Love can overcome the fear</i>

08:14.600 --> 08:20.690
<i>And life can be so much more</i>

08:20.850 --> 08:23.690
<i>Come with the gentle people</i>

08:24.230 --> 08:27.480
<i>Spread love across the land</i>

08:27.730 --> 08:30.980
<i>Come with the gentle people</i>

08:31.240 --> 08:38.620
<i>We're the only ones who understand</i>

08:38.830 --> 08:42.250
<i>Come with the gentle people</i>

08:42.460 --> 08:45.460
<i>Help us to ride the wave...</i>

08:50.420 --> 08:53.470
So all we need now
is your long-lost Aunt...

08:53.630 --> 08:56.500
- ...what's her name?
- Her name is Susan Lake.

08:56.760 --> 09:00.020
This batch has more snap.
Run the rest at the same ASA.

09:00.180 --> 09:02.850
- Long distance, Miss Lake.
- Hello? Who?

09:03.270 --> 09:07.110
Q-U-A-N-T. In London.

09:07.610 --> 09:12.150
Yeah, that's correct.
As quickly as possible.

09:12.400 --> 09:16.270
Susan, dear, we must have a chat.
The bodice is so wrong.

09:16.490 --> 09:21.330
- Doesn't she look like a cow?
- The fact is, Cynthia is not a boy.

09:21.540 --> 09:25.540
Take off your bra, dear.
That will flatten you some.

09:25.710 --> 09:29.380
Oh Gordon, have her put it back on.
Betty, tell him it's impossible.

09:29.590 --> 09:33.840
Gordon, she looks exactly the same
with or without the bra.

09:37.720 --> 09:43.140
- Porter, explain this contract to me.
- We can't get three years.

09:43.390 --> 09:47.400
They'll go two and a half.
The editor tells me that is final.

09:47.560 --> 09:49.890
- People!
- I need some time with you.

09:50.070 --> 09:55.410
Can we discuss it at dinner?
That'll give you time to talk to Vogue.

10:01.620 --> 10:03.870
- Anything we can do for you?
- That's OK...

10:04.040 --> 10:07.710
- ...I can come back.
- Out with it. We're not that frantic.

10:07.920 --> 10:11.050
- I'm your niece.
- You're Catherine's daughter?

10:11.340 --> 10:14.300
My name's Kelly Mac Namara.

10:14.510 --> 10:19.140
Susan! Susan! I am simply in a rage!

10:19.300 --> 10:21.550
How did your mother learn
about Aunt Claire?

10:21.810 --> 10:25.440
The Worcester paper is where she heard
about Aunt Claire's death and about...

10:26.310 --> 10:28.480
you and Baxter Wolfe and the inheritance.

10:28.650 --> 10:33.570
- What inheritance was that?
- Mine. I was last in line after my sister.

10:33.780 --> 10:39.120
Your mother disappeared. We were never
really close. I was 14 years younger.

10:39.280 --> 10:42.450
Now that you've come along,
I think that part of it should be yours.

10:42.740 --> 10:44.150
Susan.

10:44.910 --> 10:47.620
Susan, you know there was
no provision in the will.

10:47.790 --> 10:50.630
- Thousand Island?
- No, thank you.

10:50.880 --> 10:53.880
You're a lawyer. You should
know that wills are just paper.

10:54.090 --> 10:59.010
I'm a lawyer, yes. And any changes
Aunt Claire would or might have made...

10:59.180 --> 11:02.390
- ...have no validity in law.
- Porter, of course I know that.

11:02.550 --> 11:07.300
Kelly, there was nearly a million dollars.
I know this isn't the time or place...

11:07.480 --> 11:11.230
but since Porter's made such a
point of it, I can't see why...

11:11.400 --> 11:14.980
say, a third of it shouldn't be yours.

11:15.190 --> 11:19.610
- A third of a million dollars?
- The two of us are the only survivors.

11:19.820 --> 11:22.870
I don't see why you should have to pay
for the sins of your mother.

11:23.080 --> 11:26.410
Sins that seem to me that were really
committed by the rest of the family.

11:26.580 --> 11:32.250
- That's a big idea to get used to.
- I'll have Porter draw up the papers.

11:33.130 --> 11:36.340
I have a marvellous idea.
Ronnie Barzell's throwing a party tonight.

11:36.550 --> 11:39.470
Ronnie Barzell? You mean Z-Man Barzell?

11:39.630 --> 11:41.920
The one, the only, the original.

11:42.140 --> 11:44.260
Susan, I've got friends in a rock group.

11:44.430 --> 11:47.600
It would mean so much for them to
meet Z-Man. Can I invite them?

11:47.770 --> 11:50.850
- Don't tell me you're a groupie.
- The other way. It's my group.

11:51.020 --> 11:55.190
Now, let me be sure I fully understand
this. You are a rock'n'roll singer?

11:55.360 --> 11:58.530
- Why? Is that a no-no?
- My dear young lady....

11:58.740 --> 12:02.370
Porter, you have an unending capacity
for counterfeit astonishment.

12:02.570 --> 12:05.980
Of course you can invite your friends.
There's a phone in the living room.

12:06.160 --> 12:08.830
I think that Ronnie's address is in
my book under the B's.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.250
Great!
I'm not dressed for a party, though.

12:11.460 --> 12:14.210
We're about the same size,
and I got loads of things in my closet.

12:14.380 --> 12:17.380
Call your friends
and slip into anything you like. OK?

12:17.590 --> 12:19.470
Oh, groovy! Thanks.

12:19.670 --> 12:22.000
Susan, have you taken
leave of your senses?

12:22.180 --> 12:26.510
Some anonymous rock'n'roll singer
drops in here out of the clear blue sky...

12:26.760 --> 12:28.300
and you fall for a lie.

12:28.470 --> 12:31.510
You won't believe this, but we've been
invited to a party at Z-Man Barzell's.

12:31.980 --> 12:34.360
- Is this for real?
- Get Casey and Pet, and meet me there.

12:34.610 --> 12:38.320
This creature marches in without a cent
to her name and a dubious pedigree...

12:38.530 --> 12:40.450
and without a moment's thought...

12:40.650 --> 12:43.490
you recklessly dispose
of a third of your money.

12:43.660 --> 12:47.290
- Porter, let me handle this.
- The party starts when you get there.

12:47.490 --> 12:49.610
- Susan, please.
- We're late already.

12:52.790 --> 12:58.670
- They banned my last film in Cincinnati.
- Groovy town.

12:58.920 --> 13:01.010
When I'm with you, pussycat,
who needs grass?

13:01.220 --> 13:05.350
You'd have to see it to believe it.
Of course, I nearly choked.

13:05.890 --> 13:10.230
- And then this bitch took a drink...
- He's bothered every woman at the bar.

13:10.470 --> 13:14.050
Do you know what happened
after he drank a Fresca?

13:14.270 --> 13:19.360
- He snowed in his pants.
- You know what he uses for deodorant?

13:20.320 --> 13:22.150
- Raid.
- Cool, man.

13:22.360 --> 13:27.780
My old man really blew his mind. He said
he'd kill me if he found any more grass.

13:27.950 --> 13:30.540
- Escape, man.
- All right!

13:30.700 --> 13:34.000
- And you're a moonchild.
- And you're a bitch.

13:34.210 --> 13:37.880
- I think it's better after the change.
- I'm with you.

13:38.130 --> 13:42.470
I was ready to roll over and fall asleep.

13:42.670 --> 13:45.420
Then Tony said, "Come over to my pad.

13:45.590 --> 13:49.510
- I've got a wading pool of mayonnaise!"
- Mayonnaise?

13:49.810 --> 13:53.100
I found the European women
far more receptive and less hung-up.

13:53.270 --> 13:57.650
- She went after me like a barracuda.
- I warned you, you old fruit.

13:57.810 --> 13:59.970
- Classics Benjamin.
- Bad trip.

14:00.150 --> 14:05.030
- It wasn't long, but four inches thick.
- Ever been whipped with a wand...

14:05.200 --> 14:10.660
- ...until the blood came?
- Cool it! You'll rupture your tongue.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.380
Feel it, my pretty?
The night is filled with magic.

14:17.580 --> 14:22.910
- Mark my words, dove, tonight is special.
- I was so anxious, I stepped on her face.

14:23.090 --> 14:25.130
Susan, Porter, how are you?

14:27.380 --> 14:29.340
Ronnie, see who's here.

14:32.560 --> 14:36.480
- I'll say it. Haven't I seen you before?
- You saw her at my studio this afternoon.

14:36.690 --> 14:40.820
- Ronnie, this is my niece, Kelly.
- Every inch as ugly as you are, Susan.

14:40.980 --> 14:42.360
Must run in the family.

14:42.520 --> 14:45.140
I'd like you to meet Vanessa,
my escort and bodyguard.

14:45.440 --> 14:48.400
- Pleasure.
- Come on, babe. I'll show you the dump.

14:48.570 --> 14:53.370
Come with me, I want to show you
the most divine clairvoyant.

14:53.540 --> 14:56.500
<i>...that the people all called L.A.</i>

14:57.620 --> 14:59.700
<i>Went to school in the great big city...</i>

14:59.920 --> 15:03.000
- What can I get you, juice or grass?
- Just a vodka and tonic, please.

15:03.170 --> 15:06.760
Look there.
The infamous Ashley St. Ives...

15:06.920 --> 15:11.250
famous for her portrayals
in prettily pornographic pictures.

15:11.470 --> 15:16.520
See how she gives her body
to the ritual? Delicious.

15:16.680 --> 15:21.680
Observe in yon quiet corner, an island
of tranquility in this sea of revelry.

15:21.860 --> 15:26.240
The languid Roxanne finds beauty,
that delicate pinch of feminine spice...

15:26.440 --> 15:29.350
with which she so often flavours
her interludes.

15:29.610 --> 15:34.230
Look there. Lance Rocke.
Greek god and part-time actor.

15:34.410 --> 15:37.330
See how well he performs?
His is a special talent.

15:37.500 --> 15:41.790
The golden hair, the bedroom eyes,
the firm young body.

15:42.000 --> 15:47.840
These are the tools with which he plies
his trade. All are available for a price.

15:48.010 --> 15:53.140
Beware, fair maiden, of Emerson Thorne.
Behind that friendly mask...

15:53.350 --> 15:57.480
lies fermenting the unholy seed
of a lawyer.

15:57.640 --> 16:02.020
See there, behind the bar, the man
with the benign Germanic countenance?

16:02.230 --> 16:05.730
Could that be
another face of Martin Bormann?

16:05.900 --> 16:10.070
I've been to parties where they danced
to records by The Strawberry Alarm Clock.

16:10.320 --> 16:15.450
But this is the first time The Strawberry
Alarm Clock's ever been to the party.

16:15.620 --> 16:18.830
What are you shelling out?
I hear the minimum is four thou.

16:19.040 --> 16:22.040
- I get them for free. They're mine.
- Wow. Really?

16:22.210 --> 16:24.500
Here, have some grass.
Aunt Susan won't see you.

16:24.790 --> 16:31.290
No, thanks, man. In a scene like this,
you get a contact high!

16:33.470 --> 16:36.140
This is my happening and it freaks me out!

16:36.350 --> 16:37.970
It's a stone gas, man.

16:38.140 --> 16:40.940
Pray, we must make haste.
My time is not my own.

16:41.100 --> 16:44.730
Before the clock strikes 12.
I must be back at Forest Lawn.

16:45.110 --> 16:46.980
Come, I know of a cosy little dungeon...

16:47.150 --> 16:50.950
where just the two of us can curl up
with the chains and a spider.

16:53.700 --> 16:57.740
Delighted to see my hostages
in such happy dalliance.

16:57.910 --> 17:01.250
Pray, let them joust in peace.

17:05.040 --> 17:07.800
You're not helping the situation any,
I must say.

17:07.960 --> 17:12.970
Out. Out. Count Dracula relishes
an audience, only one at a time.

17:14.130 --> 17:18.089
- Have fun.
- What is this, a studio tour?

17:23.480 --> 17:27.069
- This looks like the...
- Master's bedroom.

17:29.860 --> 17:31.530
Can you dig it? Follow me, my dear.

17:31.690 --> 17:34.480
Let me show you one of my preoccupations.

17:34.910 --> 17:36.990
And this is the master's bath.

17:38.490 --> 17:40.370
Come on.

17:40.540 --> 17:44.370
- Sorry to disturb you.
- It's cool, baby.

17:45.330 --> 17:50.590
Hey, I've heard about trees growing
in Brooklyn, but ferns in the biffy?

17:50.960 --> 17:54.010
- Class.
- The idea came to me in a vision.

17:54.170 --> 17:58.590
- Every morning, I luxuriate in my bath.
- I dig, man. You're on an ego trip.

17:58.760 --> 18:01.890
But what about the ferns?

18:03.310 --> 18:07.440
Let's call them tropical varieties.
They thrive on the humidity...

18:07.600 --> 18:11.680
and they never let me forget
that all Los Angeles is a jungle.

18:11.980 --> 18:13.980
<i>...comin' home</i>

18:14.240 --> 18:18.280
<i>I'm comin' home</i>

18:19.700 --> 18:23.370
<i>I'm comin' home</i>

18:24.750 --> 18:28.500
<i>I'm comin' home</i>

18:29.330 --> 18:32.500
<i>When you're sitting at home
feeling all alone...</i>

18:33.670 --> 18:37.840
Hello. You must be Kelly's friends.
I'm Vanessa.

18:38.050 --> 18:42.810
- Susan, Kelly's friends have arrived.
- We've heard so much about you.

18:42.970 --> 18:47.890
- I'm Susan Lake, Kelly's aunt.
- Hi, Miss Lake. This is Pet...

18:48.060 --> 18:50.820
and Casey. And I'm Harris.

18:50.980 --> 18:54.360
- Has anyone here seen Kelly?
- I saw her a minute ago with Ronnie.

18:54.530 --> 18:57.610
- May I lead an expedition to the bar?
- No thanks, I'll take a rain check.

18:58.070 --> 19:01.120
How about you two?

19:01.580 --> 19:04.370
<i>Well I go on the road
just to make a dollar</i>

19:04.620 --> 19:07.500
<i>When the last day comes
you'll hear me holler</i>

19:07.750 --> 19:11.170
<i>I'm comin' home</i>

19:12.420 --> 19:15.380
<i>I'm comin' home</i>

19:15.630 --> 19:18.380
Excuse me.

19:18.590 --> 19:21.850
<i>I'm comin' home</i>

19:24.010 --> 19:26.590
- You don't drink?
- Later.

19:29.520 --> 19:30.770
Yeah, later.

19:30.980 --> 19:33.020
- Vodka gimlets.
- Thank you.

19:33.190 --> 19:36.070
I guess liquor's considered
kind of square these days.

19:36.230 --> 19:39.600
Same as grass.
It depends on how you use it.

19:39.780 --> 19:42.740
Would you like to meet some
of the more interesting specimens?

19:42.910 --> 19:44.370
Why not?

19:44.530 --> 19:49.740
- Casey?
- I'll stay here. Go on.

19:53.380 --> 19:54.460
- Quite a blast.
- Quite.

19:54.630 --> 19:58.470
I make it a point never to miss one
of Ronnie's parties. Better than the zoo.

19:58.760 --> 20:00.890
Putting people down
for having a good time?

20:01.050 --> 20:06.470
On the contrary, my dear. But this is
hardly my idea of a civilised good time.

20:06.680 --> 20:12.230
Casey Anderson, huh?
No relation to Senator Casey Anderson?

20:12.650 --> 20:13.690
He's my father.

20:14.020 --> 20:16.860
I'll bet he's highly amused
that his daughter's a hippie?

20:17.030 --> 20:21.570
- I'm in a rock group.
- And that's your uniform?

20:21.740 --> 20:22.780
And that's yours?

20:22.950 --> 20:26.450
At least it's not a uniform
worn by freaks.

20:27.330 --> 20:31.960
So the senator's daughter
is a rock'n'roll singer, huh?

20:32.120 --> 20:38.750
Say, do you and your friends shack up
in a minibus, or aren't things that cosy?

20:41.550 --> 20:44.890
<i>I'm comin' home</i>

20:59.280 --> 21:02.990
I couldn't help but notice
your little run-in with Porter Hall.

21:03.610 --> 21:06.150
- Men.
- Ninety-nine percent.

21:06.950 --> 21:10.160
Casey, I'd like to design something
for you.

21:10.330 --> 21:12.500
Why don't you stop by my studio sometime?

21:14.120 --> 21:18.540
It's a trip to design for a good figure
once in a while.

21:20.630 --> 21:23.340
Anyway, you could imagine
how this woman feels...

21:23.510 --> 21:26.890
when she finds out
that her 17-year-old son...

21:27.050 --> 21:29.960
is making it with one of her best friends.

21:30.390 --> 21:32.520
Now, you have to remember that she...

21:32.680 --> 21:34.470
has a young lover of her own.

21:34.640 --> 21:37.640
So it makes her take
a long look at her whole scheme.

21:37.860 --> 21:41.820
That's why in my new film,
they drag in this whole thing...

21:42.030 --> 21:46.570
about the lack of communication
between parents and kids.

22:02.800 --> 22:05.680
Well, now, Harris, we meet again.

22:05.840 --> 22:10.010
"Come into my den,"
said the spider, et cetera.

22:10.220 --> 22:13.430
- I was looking for somebody.
- Anybody I know?

22:13.640 --> 22:15.940
Where do you get this "anybody
I know" business?

22:16.100 --> 22:19.150
From one of those pornographic
movies you star in?

22:19.400 --> 22:25.030
You mean my controversial
box-office blockbusters?

22:25.240 --> 22:29.410
Ashley St. Ives.
I saw one of your movies once.

22:29.570 --> 22:35.240
I think it was the one
about the teenage incest triangle.

22:35.410 --> 22:40.200
You'll have to help me
on the research for the next one.

22:40.380 --> 22:44.880
- So you're an ear freak?
- Name some more.

22:45.050 --> 22:50.600
All right, then. How about a toe freak?

22:51.300 --> 22:55.130
I need it. I want it.

22:55.310 --> 22:59.480
A beautiful woman
kissing me between the toes.

22:59.650 --> 23:03.610
People who wear sandals
must not get very many volunteers.

23:03.780 --> 23:08.070
- I could change.
- Into something more titillating?

23:08.240 --> 23:11.580
That sounds vaguely obscene.

23:11.740 --> 23:17.290
You're a groovy boy.
I'd like to strap you on sometime.

23:17.460 --> 23:23.380
And if there's anything I can't stand,
it's vagueness.

23:24.170 --> 23:26.470
Harris.

23:26.670 --> 23:31.340
A deathly dry gin martini.

23:54.240 --> 23:58.580
- But I thought we had another case.
- Excuse me, have you seen Kelly?

23:58.750 --> 24:02.380
No, the last time I saw her
she was wandering around with Z-Man.

24:02.540 --> 24:04.170
- They can be anywhere.
- Thanks.

24:04.340 --> 24:07.170
Get yourself in gear, baby.
These people are dying of thirst.

24:07.380 --> 24:10.260
Look, I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll check. OK?

24:17.430 --> 24:22.900
- But, Lance, I gave you $1200 last week.
- I want $12,000, baby.

24:28.280 --> 24:30.150
- I'm sorry.
- Perfect timing.

24:30.360 --> 24:32.820
I was looking for the john.

24:32.990 --> 24:38.200
Z-Man Barzell is a very rich cat, but
he doesn't have a john in the kitchen.

24:38.410 --> 24:41.500
- Maybe I was looking for a sandwich.
- This ain't no welfare line.

24:41.710 --> 24:45.130
Then what are you standing in it for?

24:46.840 --> 24:49.970
- Getting my thing together.
- You putting me on?

24:50.380 --> 24:54.050
Unmasked again. He poses as a busboy...

24:54.220 --> 24:59.310
but in real life, he's Emerson Thorne...

24:59.470 --> 25:02.300
ambitious young law student...

25:02.480 --> 25:07.980
who studies by day and waits by night.

25:14.160 --> 25:17.910
I was going to say something smart-ass,
but, all of a sudden, you know what?

25:18.120 --> 25:19.540
No. What?

25:19.740 --> 25:22.030
Suddenly, I knew you
weren't putting me on...

25:22.210 --> 25:26.630
that you were Emerson Thorne,
ambitious young law student...

25:26.790 --> 25:28.950
and all that crap.

25:29.670 --> 25:32.800
What about that kiss and all that crap?

25:33.380 --> 25:36.960
There's more where that came from,
Emerson Thorne.

25:37.300 --> 25:41.300
You're into a heavy scene.
Don't sweat it. It can be a drag.

25:41.520 --> 25:43.560
- Am I interrupting something?
- Harris!

25:43.730 --> 25:46.310
Only a little make-out session
between Count Dracula...

25:46.520 --> 25:48.900
- ...and Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley.
- Hey, man.

25:49.070 --> 25:54.530
Ronnie Barzell, I'd like you
to meet Harris Allsworth, my....

25:55.070 --> 25:56.870
- My manager.
- Manager, eh?

25:57.120 --> 26:01.700
Any friend of Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley
is a friend of mine.

26:03.960 --> 26:05.710
- Manager?
- The Kelly Affair.

26:05.920 --> 26:07.750
The Kelly Affair?

26:07.920 --> 26:13.510
You mean, you're the Kelly?
Little did I suspect I was in the presence.

26:13.720 --> 26:16.680
Still, that name won't do, you know.
It's awfully 1950s.

26:16.840 --> 26:20.800
- Might as well call them The Haircuts.
- Kelly, I'm ready to leave.

26:20.970 --> 26:24.390
Leave? No. You have not yet
graced our gathering with a song.

26:24.560 --> 26:28.400
Come, my dove, I must present you
to the faithful. Now!

26:29.980 --> 26:32.230
Ladies and gentlemen,
an announcement if you please.

26:32.440 --> 26:34.650
There is a new rock group in the house.

26:34.820 --> 26:39.200
Their name, The Kelly Affair. Well, even
their best friends don't like their name.

26:39.410 --> 26:44.040
Still, as the teen tycoon of rock, I'd like
to hear them and I'm sure you would too.

26:44.200 --> 26:46.570
The Kelly Affair.

26:54.170 --> 26:57.470
I'd like to strap you on sometime.

27:03.390 --> 27:08.850
<i>I left home when I was only seventeen</i>

27:09.150 --> 27:14.650
<i>Met a guy, he and I
drove down to New Orleans</i>

27:14.820 --> 27:20.200
<i>He seemed to know his way around
and I thought I could land</i>

27:20.370 --> 27:26.710
<i>A sweet-talkin', oh, c-c, c-candy man</i>

27:27.790 --> 27:30.170
<i>Warmed his bed, kept him fed,</i>

27:30.330 --> 27:33.160
<i>And oh, I loved him so</i>

27:33.420 --> 27:35.760
<i>But I got to cry a lot</i>

27:35.920 --> 27:38.510
<i>Whenever he would go</i>

27:38.760 --> 27:41.680
<i>I guess I was just too young</i>

27:41.840 --> 27:44.420
<i>To really understand</i>

27:44.640 --> 27:50.060
<i>A sweet-talkin', oh, c-c, c-candy man</i>

27:50.230 --> 27:52.150
<i>Sweet talkin' candy man</i>

27:52.360 --> 27:54.690
<i>My sweet-talkin'...</i>

27:54.860 --> 27:57.650
<i>Sweet talkin' candy man</i>

27:57.820 --> 28:00.990
<i>Woohoo, I hear you talkin'</i>

28:02.990 --> 28:05.660
<i>He played around and brought me down</i>

28:05.870 --> 28:08.500
<i>And finally threw me out</i>

28:08.750 --> 28:11.330
<i>I got burned, but I learned</i>

28:11.500 --> 28:14.340
<i>What love was all about</i>

28:14.880 --> 28:17.170
<i>But I often think of him</i>

28:17.340 --> 28:19.680
<i>Every now and then</i>

28:19.840 --> 28:25.430
<i>That sweet-talkin', oh, candy man</i>

28:25.600 --> 28:27.600
<i>Sweet talkin' candy man</i>

28:27.810 --> 28:30.140
<i>Sweet sweet talkin'</i>

28:30.310 --> 28:33.520
<i>Sweet talkin' candy man</i>

28:33.690 --> 28:36.020
<i>Whoah, sweet talkin'</i>

28:36.190 --> 28:39.400
<i>Sweet talkin' candy man</i>

28:39.570 --> 28:43.240
<i>Sweet sweet talkin' candy man</i>

28:47.330 --> 28:50.870
Stop! Cool it! Cool it!

28:51.040 --> 28:54.290
Masters and mistresses, I'm
so excited by what I've just heard...

28:54.460 --> 28:58.800
I predict these three, like their
sister before them, Carrie Nation...

28:59.010 --> 29:01.840
will crush the musical barrier
and rise like angels.

29:02.180 --> 29:06.850
Did I say "like Carrie Nation"?
Nay, nay, they are The Carrie Nations.

29:07.010 --> 29:10.420
You'll be superstars!

29:14.100 --> 29:21.850
<i>In the long run you'll need someone</i>

29:22.070 --> 29:28.990
<i>To trust and count on
somewhere along the way</i>

29:29.160 --> 29:35.290
<i>In the long run will there be someone</i>

29:35.460 --> 29:42.970
<i>That you can lean on come a rainy day</i>

29:44.760 --> 29:51.020
<i>The sweet smell of clover
won't make the world over</i>

29:52.890 --> 29:57.230
<i>You spend idle hours talking to flowers</i>

29:57.400 --> 30:02.860
<i>Who won't even talk back to you</i>

30:03.240 --> 30:07.490
<i>If you want to bring it together</i>

30:07.740 --> 30:11.660
<i>You can't hide away forever</i>

30:11.830 --> 30:15.500
<i>Cause in the long run</i>

30:15.670 --> 30:18.880
<i>You'll need someone</i>

30:19.040 --> 30:26.750
<i>To trust and count on
somewhere along the way</i>

30:26.970 --> 30:32.600
<i>In the long run will there be someone</i>

30:32.770 --> 30:39.980
<i>That you can lean on come a rainy day</i>

30:42.070 --> 30:49.450
<i>The time that's been borrowed
won't be much help tomorrow</i>

30:50.530 --> 30:54.070
<i>Without a purpose scratching the surface</i>

30:54.250 --> 31:00.500
<i>Won't accomplish anything new</i>

31:00.920 --> 31:04.260
<i>If you find the world is enchanting</i>

31:04.510 --> 31:08.640
<i>It's up to you to start expanding</i>

31:08.800 --> 31:16.270
<i>Cause in the long run you need someone</i>

31:16.430 --> 31:22.850
<i>To trust and count on
somewhere along the way</i>

31:23.020 --> 31:29.440
<i>In the long run will there be someone</i>

31:29.610 --> 31:37.400
<i>That you can lean on come a rainy day</i>

31:37.580 --> 31:40.880
<i>Come a rainy day</i>

31:41.040 --> 31:44.420
<i>Come a rainy day</i>

31:44.590 --> 31:47.220
<i>Come a rainy day</i>

31:47.800 --> 31:52.390
<i>Come a rainy day</i>

32:19.910 --> 32:23.030
- We killed them, didn't we?
- You've reached the star...

32:23.210 --> 32:26.590
beat the unbeatable foe. The Times
and free-press critics will pay homage.

32:26.800 --> 32:29.090
Ronnie, we owe everything to you, man!

32:29.300 --> 32:31.470
My fine countess, your melodious voice...

32:31.630 --> 32:33.460
surpasses even the
haunting pipes of Circe.

32:33.720 --> 32:36.770
Beauteous Pet of triumph,
you were a thunderstorm.

32:36.970 --> 32:38.630
Casey, mistress fair...

32:38.810 --> 32:43.400
this stringed assault has left
my ears fiercely vibrating. Majestic!

32:45.770 --> 32:48.850
- You played some funky drums out there.
- I'm glad you dug it.

32:49.070 --> 32:51.950
- What's not to dig?
- Did you hear the wondrous miracle...

32:52.110 --> 32:54.730
- ...wrought by my muses?
- You've done it again, Ronnie.

32:54.910 --> 32:56.080
Again and again.

32:56.280 --> 33:00.400
Porter, methinks this brew is not
for your more delicate sensibilities.

33:00.580 --> 33:01.830
Courage, Camille.

33:02.000 --> 33:06.250
Excuse me, Casey, did you
hear the crowd? You were great.

33:06.420 --> 33:08.260
- Thank you.
- Just great.

33:08.420 --> 33:11.630
- I'm really happy.
- And you, the infamous Ashley St. Ives...

33:11.800 --> 33:14.800
high priestess of carnality,
what thinkest thou of our minstrels?

33:15.680 --> 33:19.890
Congratulations, Ronnie. They were heavy.

33:20.100 --> 33:21.600
Make haste, my supple countess.

33:21.770 --> 33:25.690
The last flight to Shangri-la leaves
within the hour. Hasten, hasten!

33:25.940 --> 33:29.110
- Come on, Casey. Let's go.
- I'll talk to you later, okay?

33:29.900 --> 33:32.570
Does not the moment amuse you, Kracow?

33:32.820 --> 33:38.950
Hasten, ere the portcullis
bars your entrance to Elsinore.

33:39.370 --> 33:41.830
Here, let me help you.

33:42.040 --> 33:45.670
- Pet, where's Emerson?
- Cramming for bar exams.

33:45.880 --> 33:47.460
When are you two gonna shack up?

33:47.630 --> 33:50.880
As soon as he can move me
into the law library.

33:52.300 --> 33:56.090
- Hey, there's another party at Z-Man's.
- So, what else is new?

33:56.300 --> 33:59.510
Like every night. Deal me out.

33:59.680 --> 34:02.810
- What's the matter, babe?
- Nothing. Just beat.

34:02.980 --> 34:07.690
All I want is some peace and quiet,
and that's one thing Z-Man can't offer.

34:08.020 --> 34:11.570
Have a ball. I'll see you tomorrow.

34:11.780 --> 34:13.239
Ciao.

34:21.199 --> 34:25.170
- Good night.
- Case?

34:33.590 --> 34:37.340
- Got any more grass, man?
- I scored this afternoon.

34:37.550 --> 34:40.429
The cat swore up and down
it was Acapulco Gold.

34:40.600 --> 34:45.440
- If we're lucky, maybe it's at least pot.
- Or we'll get an oregano high.

34:45.600 --> 34:49.270
- Weren't you with Emerson all afternoon?
- I was.

34:49.440 --> 34:52.650
- I thought he was at the law library.
- He was.

34:53.860 --> 34:55.900
So, like, when did you score, man?

34:56.110 --> 34:59.910
Well, Emerson slipped me
a graduate-student pass.

35:00.070 --> 35:05.820
I went back in the stacks to do some
research in the rare book collection.

35:06.000 --> 35:11.130
- And who do I run into but my score?
- Cool, man. That's getting it together.

35:11.340 --> 35:14.800
- Yeah. See you later, Kel.
- OK.

35:27.560 --> 35:30.560
- Hi, babe. Coming to the party tonight?
- What party?

35:30.730 --> 35:33.690
Everyone's splitting for Z-Man's.

35:33.900 --> 35:37.450
- Everybody?
- You bugged, man?

35:37.610 --> 35:40.450
- Yeah.
- What's the matter, baby?

35:40.610 --> 35:43.190
- Things happened tonight.
- Sure.

35:43.370 --> 35:47.870
- So?
- So where do I fit in, Kelly?

35:48.710 --> 35:50.540
- I don't dig.
- There once was a time...

35:50.710 --> 35:53.040
maybe you can remember,
when I was your manager...

35:53.250 --> 35:55.920
not the next thing to a goddamn groupie.

36:00.970 --> 36:03.310
Come along to Z-Man's. Do you good.

36:04.140 --> 36:05.270
Move it out, Kelly.

36:08.390 --> 36:12.110
- Be right there.
- I will meet you out by the car.

36:16.980 --> 36:19.600
I gotta split, man.

36:24.160 --> 36:27.870
- Say, Miss Mac Namara?
- Uh-huh?

36:28.040 --> 36:31.120
You were great. You really turned them on.

36:31.290 --> 36:33.250
Oh, thanks.

36:33.420 --> 36:38.760
Don't I know you from somewhere?
Don't tell me your name. You're....

36:39.010 --> 36:43.800
- Lance. Lance Rocke.
- That's it!

36:44.430 --> 36:48.060
Coming to the party at Z-Man's tonight?

36:48.310 --> 36:50.350
I don't know.

36:50.730 --> 36:52.850
What do you think, Miriam?
Feel like a party?

36:53.020 --> 36:54.940
Not really, Lance.

36:55.110 --> 37:00.030
Sounds divine, but it's past my bedtime.

37:00.280 --> 37:02.360
That's a shame, Miriam.

37:03.570 --> 37:05.830
It's gonna be so much fun.

37:07.240 --> 37:10.490
- You sure?
- As sure as sure can be.

37:13.330 --> 37:17.130
Well, at least let me call you a cab.

37:21.470 --> 37:25.050
What do you say, everybody? Let's do it.

38:05.760 --> 38:09.850
- Going my way?
- I'm skipping the party. I'm going home.

38:10.010 --> 38:15.090
I'm skipping the party too. Why don't
you climb in, unless you have a ride?

38:15.310 --> 38:18.900
- Don't put yourself out. I can hitch.
- We're going the same way.

38:19.110 --> 38:23.610
Come on. Get in.

38:43.260 --> 38:46.430
Turn left at the next street.

38:51.970 --> 38:56.020
Mine's the one on the right
with the bright lights.

39:03.280 --> 39:05.150
- So?
- Thanks a lot, Ashley.

39:05.320 --> 39:08.910
Don't I even deserve a good night kiss?

39:32.180 --> 39:34.720
Let's go inside.

39:34.930 --> 39:39.060
- What's wrong with the Rolls?
- Not when my bed's handy.

39:39.270 --> 39:43.440
- I want you right here.
- At least we can park in the driveway.

40:20.190 --> 40:23.150
Now it's your move.

40:23.310 --> 40:25.970
<i>In the long run</i>

40:26.230 --> 40:29.600
<i>You'll need someone</i>

40:29.820 --> 40:33.490
<i>To trust and count on</i>

40:33.780 --> 40:37.540
<i>Somewhere along the way</i>

40:38.370 --> 40:40.170
It's my first time in a Rolls.

40:41.870 --> 40:43.740
There's nothing like a Rolls, Harris.

40:44.920 --> 40:47.210
There's nothing like a Rolls.

40:47.380 --> 40:49.800
Nothing. Nothing like a Rolls!

40:50.920 --> 40:54.590
Not even a Bentley! Not even a Bentley!

40:55.220 --> 41:00.270
Bentley! Bentley!
It's like a Rolls. A Rolls!

41:00.680 --> 41:03.340
A Rolls!

41:03.940 --> 41:07.110
You're beautiful, Kelly.

41:08.150 --> 41:12.530
Kel, who's that Susan Lake broad?
What's her story?

41:12.780 --> 41:17.330
- Susan Lake, my long-lost aunt.
- Aunt Susan?

41:17.530 --> 41:21.990
That's far out. She's a fine-looking lady.

41:22.160 --> 41:25.410
Nice and firm.

41:25.580 --> 41:30.870
Round and beautiful. Well, pneumatic.

41:31.090 --> 41:34.840
- Aunt Susan?
- Yeah, Aunt Susan.

41:36.050 --> 41:41.760
- She'd flip out to hear you say that.
- I doubt it.

41:43.640 --> 41:46.800
- Lance?
- Yeah?

41:47.110 --> 41:51.280
- I'm thinking of cutting my hair.
- Well, don't.

41:51.490 --> 41:52.950
Why not?

41:53.150 --> 41:55.020
I wanna love you for more than money.

41:55.240 --> 41:57.870
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean, the millions.

41:58.030 --> 42:02.530
- The Lake millions.
- You know a lot about me, don't you?

42:02.700 --> 42:06.660
- There's no secrets at Z-Man's.
- I gently suggested to Aunt Susan...

42:06.880 --> 42:11.170
- ...that the millions could go screw.
- You what?

42:11.340 --> 42:14.840
- You heard me.
- Wow, baby, that was really dumb.

42:15.050 --> 42:17.140
And how come you're only getting a third?

42:17.300 --> 42:19.640
You ought to be getting half,
and you know it.

42:19.810 --> 42:22.230
- Why should I get anything at all?
- You earned it.

42:22.390 --> 42:26.940
Getting shafted all your life while all
those relatives lived it up in Worcester.

42:27.100 --> 42:31.020
- You know a lot about my family.
- Like I say...

42:31.190 --> 42:34.860
there aren't many secrets around here.

42:35.030 --> 42:37.740
Kelly. Now listen, Kelly.

42:37.910 --> 42:41.490
I'm gonna give you some free advice.
Baby, and you'd better take it.

42:41.660 --> 42:46.460
The noble Porter Hall is trying
to get his lunch hooks on that dough.

42:46.620 --> 42:49.660
He's screwing you, baby, not Susan Lake.

42:50.540 --> 42:52.450
That girl Kelly Mac Namara is a tramp.

42:52.630 --> 42:55.550
She was living in a single room
with three other individuals.

42:55.720 --> 42:57.720
One of them was a male. And the other two?

42:57.880 --> 42:59.670
Well, the other two were females.

42:59.890 --> 43:02.020
God only knows what they
were up to in there.

43:02.180 --> 43:04.600
And furthermore,
I wouldn't be surprised to learn...

43:04.770 --> 43:09.270
that all four of them
habitually smoke marijuana cigarettes.

43:09.440 --> 43:13.280
- Reefers.
- I'm Kelly Mac Namara, Ms. Lake's niece.

43:13.440 --> 43:16.150
- Hi, I'm glad to know you.
- Thanks. She in? Can I see her?

43:16.360 --> 43:17.530
I'll see.

43:17.700 --> 43:20.070
- Miss Lake, Miss Mac Namara.
- Besides, if Kelly does turn on...

43:20.240 --> 43:22.740
- Send her in.
- You may go in now, Miss Mac Namara.

43:22.910 --> 43:24.790
- Thanks. Bye.
- Bye.

43:25.000 --> 43:28.080
Now you try to contain yourself, Porter.

43:28.250 --> 43:33.130
- I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
- Come in, Kelly. Porter's all steamed up.

43:33.300 --> 43:36.090
- Too much partying.
- You listen to me, hippie.

43:36.300 --> 43:38.680
I don't know who you are
or where you came from...

43:38.840 --> 43:42.220
but if you don't withdraw your
morbid interest in Miss Lake's affairs...

43:42.390 --> 43:47.440
- ...I shall be forced to take legal action.
- Man, I doubt if you'd recognise a hippie.

43:47.640 --> 43:48.970
I'm a capitalist, baby.

43:49.140 --> 43:51.850
I work for my living,
not suck off somebody else.

43:52.020 --> 43:56.400
Not a penny, Miss Mac Namara.
Not a single penny. I promise you that.

43:56.570 --> 43:59.950
- You're making a fool of yourself.
- A tramp with the morals of an alley cat.

44:00.160 --> 44:03.950
- Up yours, ratso!
- Not a single penny. It's not her money.

44:04.160 --> 44:07.330
Even if she is who she claims to be,
her behaviour's disgusting.

44:07.500 --> 44:11.210
- I'll take half a million dollars, man!
- What was that?

44:11.420 --> 44:17.420
You heard me. Half a million dollars
and not a penny less.

44:17.920 --> 44:21.880
How can you be so blind, Susan?
I met her type before.

44:22.090 --> 44:26.550
The little innocent face and smile.
The little, sweet virgin-whore.

44:26.720 --> 44:29.630
Porter, why are you acting like this?
She's only a child!

44:29.850 --> 44:31.900
It's got to be, Susan.

44:32.100 --> 44:36.140
It's gotta be half.
Half a million dollars.

44:36.320 --> 44:40.700
Mom never wanted it,
but she should have had it.

44:40.860 --> 44:42.410
That's the way it's gotta be.

44:42.610 --> 44:46.230
Precedent for a defendant waiving
jury trial for a private hearing...

44:46.410 --> 44:50.790
- ...in a case involving national security?
- Um...

44:50.960 --> 44:55.130
Talbott v. United States.
Supreme Court decision, 1917.

44:55.290 --> 44:58.000
Amended 1941,
in the case of the government.

44:58.170 --> 45:02.930
Plaintiff v. Consolidated Industries
and defendant Robert F. Zanka.

45:03.390 --> 45:07.850
Prejudice of jury alleged in case
involving alien national...?

45:08.060 --> 45:10.640
Enough. Tomorrow I'll study.

45:10.810 --> 45:15.150
- Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow.
- You sound like Z-Man.

45:15.360 --> 45:21.150
And Z-Man sounds like Will Shakespeare.
Right now, I feel like making love.

45:42.670 --> 45:45.250
She loves me, she loves me not.

45:45.430 --> 45:48.390
What is this, Tammy and the lawyer?

45:48.560 --> 45:51.140
If I don't dig you,
how come I'm making it with you?

45:51.310 --> 45:55.480
Because I'm the ballsiest cat
you ever did meet.

45:55.690 --> 45:57.690
What did you say
before you lost your cool?

45:58.060 --> 46:01.100
Because I'm the ballsiest cat
you ever did meet.

46:01.280 --> 46:02.360
Right on!

46:44.150 --> 46:50.580
Kelly? I mean Miss Mac Namara.
Good morning, Porter Hall here.

46:51.200 --> 46:52.750
Hello?

46:52.950 --> 46:55.360
- Who was it, baby?
- Porter Hall.

47:02.840 --> 47:05.760
- See what the ace has got to say.
- We were cut off.

47:05.920 --> 47:09.170
I'm terribly sorry about that scene
in Susan's office yesterday.

47:09.390 --> 47:12.310
Certainly, I never remotely intended
to give the impression...

47:12.470 --> 47:13.560
I must have left.

47:13.810 --> 47:16.810
There are so many things I feel
we have in common...

47:16.980 --> 47:19.980
that I'd appreciate it very much
if we could have a drink...

47:20.150 --> 47:23.150
perhaps sometime this afternoon
and discuss them.

47:23.360 --> 47:25.650
Have the drink. Go ahead.

47:26.610 --> 47:30.870
- OK, Mr. Hall.
- Excellent. That pleases me very much.

47:31.070 --> 47:37.450
- And where shall we meet?
- Tell him O'Rourke's. O'Rourke's.

47:38.210 --> 47:40.330
- O'Rourke's.
- O'Rourke's?

47:40.540 --> 47:43.590
- Yeah, near City College.
- Fine. And at what time?

47:43.920 --> 47:50.180
- 3:00, I guess. Tell him 3.
- I'll be there about 3.

47:50.340 --> 47:54.260
See you then. Bye.

47:56.680 --> 47:59.760
You did good, beautiful.

48:04.980 --> 48:11.310
You know the mother's up to something.
Here's your chance to really shaft him.

48:11.490 --> 48:14.200
Think so?

48:16.410 --> 48:19.330
I know so.

48:25.130 --> 48:30.010
I'll be out of here by 3,
in case you need the place.

48:30.180 --> 48:34.220
Why do I do everything you tell me?

48:36.010 --> 48:39.630
I don't know. Why do you?

48:39.850 --> 48:43.520
I can't help myself.
You've made me into a whore.

48:43.690 --> 48:46.440
And you dig it, you little freak.

48:46.610 --> 48:50.240
Kelly, I'm so pleased
that you agreed to meet me.

48:50.400 --> 48:54.520
That scene yesterday? I've already told
you how perfectly dreadful I feel about it.

48:54.740 --> 48:58.250
I made certain allegations
that I can only deeply apologise for.

48:58.450 --> 49:00.240
- ID?
- I'm having a coffee.

49:00.410 --> 49:04.240
A very dry vodka martini for me.
Make it a double, please.

49:04.420 --> 49:07.300
Of course we've had our
misunderstandings, but who hasn't?

49:07.460 --> 49:12.680
I believe they call it the generation gap.
In my day, they called it something else.

49:12.880 --> 49:16.840
I can remember when my father raised
the dickens over me. I was a devil then.

49:17.060 --> 49:21.190
Came home in a pinch-back suit. He
thought I'd gone the way of Oscar Wilde.

49:23.690 --> 49:27.480
- That'll be $1.20.
- Start a tab for me, will you please?

49:27.820 --> 49:30.950
- Would you like something stronger?
- They don't serve it in bars.

49:31.110 --> 49:32.740
Hey, got a quarter?

49:42.040 --> 49:44.880
Perhaps it's just as well.

49:56.850 --> 50:01.890
In any event, I didn't ask you
to meet me today simply to apologise.

50:02.100 --> 50:07.400
I also wanted to discuss this financial
misunderstanding we're enmeshed in.

50:07.560 --> 50:12.140
Now, as Miss Lake's adviser,
I have her best interests at heart.

50:12.360 --> 50:15.110
However, I want to suggest
a business arrangement.

50:15.280 --> 50:20.490
An arrangement that would be
the greatest benefit to all concerned.

50:20.660 --> 50:23.910
Now, I've taken the liberty
of drawing up this document.

50:24.080 --> 50:29.050
By which, in return for the handsome
consideration of $50,000 immediately...

50:29.250 --> 50:34.840
you would agree to discontinue,
or, should I say, no longer press charges.

50:36.930 --> 50:38.220
Kelly.

50:40.680 --> 50:43.770
- Kelly, please let me finish.
- You are finished, cheap swindler.

50:43.930 --> 50:46.840
You and Susan Lake and your documents.

50:47.060 --> 50:50.570
Wait, I assure you, Susan Lake
had absolutely no knowledge of this.

50:50.770 --> 50:55.690
Congratulations. I didn't think you had
the balls to go sneaking behind her back.

50:55.900 --> 51:00.020
- Kelly, please.
- Oh, get!

51:11.460 --> 51:14.010
McHugh, throw me a bar rag.

51:14.170 --> 51:17.680
- A clean one.
- Coming at you.

51:25.480 --> 51:29.440
Porter, I'm sorry I lost my temper.

51:29.600 --> 51:34.350
It was my fault bringing you here.
Tell you what...

51:34.530 --> 51:40.740
let's go to my place. We can talk
some more about your document.

51:57.510 --> 51:59.300
- Want some?
- What is it?

51:59.470 --> 52:04.220
Oh, Porter.
You mean you don't know what it is?

52:08.730 --> 52:12.480
Of course I know what it is.

52:14.690 --> 52:19.280
Porter, don't waste it!
Look, look, let me show you.

52:19.450 --> 52:23.200
Draw in. That's it. Hold it here.

52:23.410 --> 52:26.160
That's it. Now blow it out.

52:26.370 --> 52:30.920
Let me show you. Look. Like this.

52:37.840 --> 52:40.680
See? Now you do it.

52:40.970 --> 52:45.100
See? Deep down. Deep down here.

52:45.350 --> 52:48.100
Porter, you're so cute.

52:49.930 --> 52:54.220
I think I'll change into something
more comfortable.

53:03.030 --> 53:06.450
Hang cool, teddy bear.

53:39.110 --> 53:44.700
<i>I left home when I was only seventeen</i>

53:44.860 --> 53:47.320
<i>Met a guy, he and I...</i>

53:47.580 --> 53:51.000
Why don't you lose your laundry, Porter?

53:51.200 --> 53:55.740
<i>He seemed to know his way around
and I thought I could land</i>

53:55.920 --> 54:00.590
<i>A sweet-talkin', oh, c-c, c-candy man</i>

54:00.880 --> 54:07.220
Come on, Porter.
You're taking so much time.

54:08.300 --> 54:11.420
Hurry, Porter.

54:11.640 --> 54:14.480
<i>...whenever he would go</i>

54:14.730 --> 54:20.230
<i>I guess I was just too young
to really understand</i>

54:20.400 --> 54:25.240
<i>A sweet-talkin', oh, c-c, c-candy man</i>

54:25.410 --> 54:28.620
<i>Sweet talkin' candy man</i>

54:28.870 --> 54:33.160
<i>My sweet-talkin'...
Sweet-talkin' candy man</i>

54:34.000 --> 54:38.840
Porter, really.
Wearing your underwear to bed?

54:39.040 --> 54:42.660
I'll help you. Come on.

54:42.880 --> 54:47.760
Hey, have you got lead in your...? There.

54:47.930 --> 54:49.930
<i>What love was all about</i>

54:50.100 --> 54:55.310
<i>But I often think of him
every now and then</i>

54:55.480 --> 54:58.690
<i>That sweet-talkin', oh...</i>

54:58.860 --> 55:04.030
- Kelly?
- Yes, Porter?

55:04.320 --> 55:08.370
<i>Sweet sweet talkin',
sweet talkin' candy man</i>

55:08.570 --> 55:11.730
Never mind, Porter.

55:11.910 --> 55:15.500
If you don't tell Aunt Susan, I won't.

55:18.750 --> 55:22.630
A toast, a toast, my friends,
to The Carrie Nations...

55:22.880 --> 55:27.840
and to their first golden record.
Long may they reign.

55:28.010 --> 55:33.100
<i>You'll need someone
to trust and count on...</i>

55:33.260 --> 55:36.300
So that's the pole-vaulter?

55:36.520 --> 55:40.810
Between that and those little pills,
you won't be good for anything.

55:42.520 --> 55:46.940
Ashley's got a better idea.

55:48.740 --> 55:51.740
<i>Come a rainy day</i>

55:54.240 --> 56:00.160
<i>The sweet smell of clover
won't make the world over</i>

56:01.500 --> 56:03.960
Now you're inviting motor psychos
to your parties.

56:04.170 --> 56:06.170
What next, truck drivers and longshoremen?

56:06.380 --> 56:08.840
- You mean really rough trade?
- Huh?

56:09.130 --> 56:11.750
Never mind.

56:12.970 --> 56:15.640
I hope Kelly knows
what she's getting into.

56:15.810 --> 56:19.480
- Lance Rocke is no Prince Valiant.
- They deserve each other.

56:21.350 --> 56:23.760
- Where's Emerson, pussycat?
- Bar exams, as usual.

56:23.980 --> 56:29.150
That's gratitude. I promote him to waiter
and he decides to be a lawyer instead.

56:29.320 --> 56:32.950
- Still, some good came of it. He met you.
- Thank you.

56:34.370 --> 56:37.660
This should be fascinating.
See the cat in the Brooks Brothers suit?

56:38.160 --> 56:40.540
Who is he?
He looks straight for this crowd.

56:40.710 --> 56:42.250
His name is Baxter Wolfe.

56:42.420 --> 56:44.800
You've treated her like this
since meeting her.

56:44.960 --> 56:48.920
She's after your money. Nothing you
can say will change my opinion.

56:49.090 --> 56:51.720
They were in love for years.
He proposed to her once...

56:51.880 --> 56:54.920
- ...but it was the wrong moment.
- As your legal adviser...

56:55.100 --> 56:57.560
let me handle this in my own discreet way.

56:57.720 --> 57:01.510
I've already seen a display of your
discretion. It's reminiscent of a meat axe.

57:01.810 --> 57:04.020
- She doesn't know he's in Hollywood.
- Really?

57:04.230 --> 57:08.440
- Baxter Wolfe.
- Hello, Ronnie.

57:08.990 --> 57:10.900
Hello, Susan.

57:11.360 --> 57:13.950
Baxter, I'd like you
to meet Petronella Danforth.

57:14.120 --> 57:18.410
- And this is Porter Hall.
- Glad to meet you. Heard a lot about you.

57:19.370 --> 57:21.080
- How have you been, Susan?
- OK.

57:21.290 --> 57:24.380
I hear you're doing quite well
in the advertising field.

57:24.540 --> 57:28.420
- Yes, Baxter.
- We seem to be interrupting a reunion.

57:28.590 --> 57:31.220
- May I escort you to the bar?
- I want a daiquiri.

57:31.380 --> 57:33.840
Could you get away?
I'd like to talk to you.

57:34.010 --> 57:35.390
OK.

57:35.550 --> 57:38.760
<i>...there'll be someone...</i>

57:39.470 --> 57:41.550
- It's been three years.
- Doesn't matter.

57:41.730 --> 57:44.520
I'm still in love with you, Susan.
I always have been.

57:44.730 --> 57:48.030
I've changed. I'm no longer the guy
who swore he'd never marry.

57:48.190 --> 57:49.490
I heard you were engaged.

57:49.650 --> 57:52.200
Now that you mention it,
I suppose I am engaged.

57:52.450 --> 57:55.950
Or should I say, I was engaged?

57:56.200 --> 58:00.000
I only seriously proposed marriage
once in my life, Susan.

58:00.240 --> 58:02.990
And the offer still stands.

58:17.640 --> 58:21.230
Z-Man really has a spread.
I heard it cost half a million.

58:21.470 --> 58:24.840
- Is that all?
- Well, it's a lot of bread to me.

58:25.060 --> 58:28.270
- Hey, Rockey baby!
- Hey, man. What's happening?

58:28.440 --> 58:30.650
Get over here and have a drink on me!

58:30.820 --> 58:33.820
- Double Johnnie Walker on the rocks.
- Red label or black?

58:34.110 --> 58:35.320
- Black.
- Schwarz.

58:35.530 --> 58:38.660
For my blue-eyed soul brother.
Lance, how you been doing, baby?

58:38.870 --> 58:41.660
Hey, you still balling that rich chick
with the knockers?

58:42.040 --> 58:44.080
Here's another one
in case you ever run out.

58:44.330 --> 58:47.080
Goddamn it, Randy.
I haven't seen you in six months, man.

58:47.290 --> 58:49.500
- How the hell you been?
- Making it, baby.

58:49.750 --> 58:53.880
Wait a minute, since last I saw you,
you won the heavyweight championship.

58:54.090 --> 58:55.720
- Congratulations!
- Thanks, baby.

58:55.880 --> 58:59.550
- Digging it, champ?
- Miss Kelly Mac Namara.

58:59.760 --> 59:04.060
Miss Petronella Danforth.
Meet Randy Black. We call him The Man.

59:04.270 --> 59:07.400
Two-thirds of my latest creation, champ.
The Carrie Nations.

59:07.650 --> 59:10.400
What are you doing here alone, baby?
Making a last stand?

59:10.610 --> 59:13.110
Don't worry about me.
I got a real nice old man.

59:13.320 --> 59:15.490
If you've got a nice old man,
where is he now?

59:15.700 --> 59:19.530
He's studying for a bar exam,
if that makes any difference to you.

59:19.780 --> 59:21.830
Well, that changes everything.

59:22.240 --> 59:23.860
- He a brother?
- Right on.

59:24.080 --> 59:26.540
Then it's my duty to get you
out on this dance floor...

59:26.710 --> 59:30.090
and keep you all nice and...

59:30.250 --> 59:32.380
easy for him.

59:38.180 --> 59:41.180
- Where is Casey?
- I phoned her, but she crashed.

59:41.390 --> 59:44.730
The champion of the world.
I haven't seen him for six months.

01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:04.290
Come on, Ashley.
We're on the goddamn sand.

01:00:04.490 --> 01:00:08.320
- So?
- Somebody could step on us.

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:14.500
- That would be a gas, Harris.
- Phone booth. On a billiard table.

01:00:14.670 --> 01:00:19.050
Swinging from a chandelier.
Standing up in a canoe.

01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:23.640
There's more to life
than the classic position.

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:27.920
Would you cool it, Ashley?
Hey, let's make it in a bed for a change.

01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:33.400
- That'd be kind of freaky.
- Harris, I can't wait.

01:00:38.530 --> 01:00:42.990
Harris, you're so square.
You kids are supposed to be swingers.

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:45.490
I think it'd be a gas
to make love on the beach.

01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:50.360
What does sex amount to without guilt?
That's what Sigmund Freud says.

01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:53.540
Take away the guilt,
and who'd ever want to get laid?

01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:56.460
Why the hell don't you lay Sigmund Freud?

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:08.350
Harris, you're drunk and you're stoned.
And the worst of it is...

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:12.940
you're a lousy lay.
You'll never get into one of my films...

01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:16.140
unless maybe as a hairdresser.

01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:19.150
- What do you mean?
- Kinder to tell you now, lover.

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:25.830
Maybe it's not too late for you
to find some nice, tender boy.

01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:47.220
<i>Come with the gentle people</i>

01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:51.180
<i>Spread love across the land</i>

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:53.730
<i>Come with the gentle...</i>

01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:56.270
Kelly!

01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:59.940
<i>...the only ones who understand</i>

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:01.950
- Harris?
- Hey.

01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:07.110
I said, hey!
The lady's made her choice, loser.

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:14.360
Baby, get up! Attaboy. Come on.
There you go.

01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:17.130
Come on, get up. Attaboy, come on.

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:22.340
Let's go. I referee fights, man.
Get up. Come on.

01:02:22.510 --> 01:02:25.720
Don't choke him, pick him up.
Come on, hold him.

01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:28.600
Stick him, Lance. Hit him.

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:31.550
- Come on, man.
- The outcome is inevitable.

01:02:31.770 --> 01:02:36.690
The golden gladiator
must emerge victorious.

01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:39.860
<i>Come with the gentle people</i>

01:02:40.650 --> 01:02:43.700
<i>Spread love across the land</i>

01:02:43.990 --> 01:02:47.320
<i>Come with the gentle people...</i>

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:53.280
- Lance, stop it. You've hurt him enough.
- He hit on me!

01:02:55.870 --> 01:02:57.820
Harris.

01:03:09.930 --> 01:03:12.770
Big lover.

01:03:12.930 --> 01:03:16.020
Big man.

01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:19.230
Dundee, Lance.

01:03:19.770 --> 01:03:23.280
How's she getting home?

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:26.070
It's her car.

01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:29.870
We could have used you
at the Russian front.

01:03:30.370 --> 01:03:37.120
What I see is beyond your dreaming.

01:03:39.830 --> 01:03:42.080
Miss Mac Namara...

01:03:42.250 --> 01:03:44.910
remember.

01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:49.390
Mr. Hall!

01:03:55.560 --> 01:04:00.690
Take your $50,000, lover.

01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:09.200
- What have you done to Kelly?
- She attacked me.

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:15.440
- I find that very difficult to believe.
- Must you continue defending her?

01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:20.540
Susan, I think this concerns you.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.460
I never wanna see you again.

01:04:24.630 --> 01:04:29.590
- Well, as your legal adviser...
- You'd better leave, Hall.

01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:42.150
- The way he humiliated Kelly....
- Hold on, honey.

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:44.150
You can't help her right now.

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:47.490
This is something she'll
have to work out for herself.

01:04:47.650 --> 01:04:51.280
- But...
- No, baby, no. Not now.

01:04:51.450 --> 01:04:55.080
Just leave it.
That's the trouble with people today.

01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:58.710
All uptight about tomorrow.
Hanging onto yesterday.

01:04:58.870 --> 01:05:02.080
It's no good. No good at all.

01:05:02.250 --> 01:05:06.210
There's only one time that counts.
Now. Right now.

01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:13.140
If you don't live for now, you might
as well roll over and take the full count.

01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:17.560
So, what are you,
the heavyweight philosopher?

01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:22.180
Hey. Just try me.

01:05:22.350 --> 01:05:25.930
Really a fine performance, Lance. Superb.

01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:29.950
Nice little party
and you chop up the chick's boyfriend.

01:05:30.110 --> 01:05:32.660
Boyfriend?

01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:36.450
Boyfriend? Now listen, Barzell...

01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:40.620
I don't know where everybody's
getting this boyfriend crap.

01:05:40.790 --> 01:05:43.830
But the chick's been sleeping with me.
You got it?

01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:48.240
Knowing you, I'm sure she has.
Have you run an audit on her books yet?

01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:52.130
Or are you still screwing on faith?

01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:55.470
You know, I don't like the tone
of your voice.

01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:57.390
- Don't like it?
- No, I don't like it.

01:05:57.550 --> 01:06:00.920
It's a shame you narrowed your field.
You'd make a great switch hitter.

01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:05.190
I'm all alone tonight. It appears that you
are too. So why don't the two of us...?

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:15.410
This really isn't your night,
is it, pussycat?

01:06:45.690 --> 01:06:48.940
- Who is it?
- It's me, Harris. Can I come in?

01:06:55.650 --> 01:06:58.480
Thanks, Casey.

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:03.460
What happened to you?

01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:08.410
OK, the silent bit.

01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:11.960
Pour me one too, will you?

01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:22.270
You want a downer?

01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:25.440
- Casey?
- I'm here.

01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:28.100
- Ashley called me a fag.
- Oh, that's a lot of crap.

01:07:28.310 --> 01:07:29.610
- I don't know.
- Harris.

01:07:29.770 --> 01:07:31.440
I don't know. I just don't know.

01:07:31.650 --> 01:07:34.360
You need some rest.

01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:39.530
- Juice. It's a bad trip.
- What are you, my mother?

01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:42.740
I'm your friend!

01:07:44.370 --> 01:07:47.540
I don't mean to dump on you, Casey.

01:07:47.710 --> 01:07:51.630
You get mixed up with these people
and two weeks later, you're an alcoholic.

01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:54.380
There are juice freaks
and there are pill freaks.

01:07:54.550 --> 01:07:59.010
And everybody's a freak.
What you need is grass or a downer.

01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:03.770
- All I wanna do is rap.
- Then rap. What is this faggot business?

01:08:03.930 --> 01:08:05.560
She said I'm a lousy lay too.

01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:09.090
Then I went into the house
and made a bigger ass of myself.

01:08:18.149 --> 01:08:20.609
Medicine.

01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:30.130
- Casey?
- Yeah.

01:08:30.330 --> 01:08:35.800
- Can I sleep with you tonight?
- Sure, I've got all the room in the world.

01:08:40.050 --> 01:08:44.260
- Still uptight?
- Don't you understand?

01:08:44.430 --> 01:08:48.229
Kelly and Harris, they're my friends.

01:08:48.430 --> 01:08:53.350
You're a bleeder. What you need
is an old man who's always handy.

01:08:54.359 --> 01:08:56.939
- Is that your old man?
- Emerson!

01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:07.620
Emerson, you were gonna study.
But you said you were going to study!

01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:22.180
- I guess he didn't take it too well.
- Get out. Get out of here!

01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:34.359
- Get out!
- All you want is a little action...

01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:37.029
and every time there's a hassle.

01:10:10.470 --> 01:10:13.800
You're in my way, man. Again.

01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:18.730
Move your ass out of the way, son.
Son of a bitch, get the hell out of there!

01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:29.160
You either move your ass, boy,
or I'll move it for you!

01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:36.830
Get me off of here,
you bastard! You stupid bastard!

01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:39.660
Stop this car!

01:10:41.630 --> 01:10:42.880
Oh my God!

01:10:43.090 --> 01:10:46.510
Stupid son of a bitch, stop the damn car!

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:50.890
- What's the matter with you?
- I can fix you once and for all!

01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:54.390
Emerson! Emerson!

01:11:04.150 --> 01:11:09.740
Oh my God, Emerson. Oh my God.

01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:13.200
- It's all right.
- I didn't mean it.

01:11:13.370 --> 01:11:18.580
I'm such a fool. I love you. I love you.

01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:36.730
You bastard. You lousy bastard!

01:11:38.310 --> 01:11:41.270
Was it good? Did you enjoy yourself?

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:44.820
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Goddamn it, you're like the rest.

01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:48.200
- Casey, like I was...
- Just shut up!

01:11:48.450 --> 01:11:51.030
Get out of here!

01:12:25.110 --> 01:12:27.950
Hello?

01:12:28.150 --> 01:12:30.480
Hello?

01:12:35.540 --> 01:12:37.750
Where to, amigo?

01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:56.180
<i>Lately you feel so insecure</i>

01:12:57.220 --> 01:13:01.800
<i>Seems you had a bad affair</i>

01:13:02.770 --> 01:13:08.030
<i>And that you're actin' immature</i>

01:13:08.190 --> 01:13:13.150
<i>To hide the hurt you felt</i>

01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:19.200
<i>You've gone down, so far down</i>

01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:24.840
<i>Now when you turn around</i>

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:30.840
<i>Look on up, look on up at the bottom</i>

01:13:31.010 --> 01:13:35.050
<i>Look on down at your love</i>

01:13:36.510 --> 01:13:42.340
<i>Look on up, look on up at the bottom</i>

01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:46.820
<i>Look on down, look on down at your love</i>

01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:54.530
<i>You warm your hands in empty pockets</i>

01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:55.990
<i>Look on up</i>

01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:00.710
<i>Where's the good life that you knew?</i>

01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:02.120
<i>Look on up</i>

01:14:02.410 --> 01:14:06.120
<i>You took a back seat, now don't knock it</i>

01:14:06.290 --> 01:14:07.580
<i>Look on up</i>

01:14:07.750 --> 01:14:12.430
<i>Well no-one remembers you</i>

01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:19.270
<i>Look on down, so far down</i>

01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:24.520
<i>Now when you turn around</i>

01:14:24.690 --> 01:14:30.650
<i>Look on up, look on up at the bottom</i>

01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:34.820
<i>Look on down, look on down at your love</i>

01:14:36.030 --> 01:14:41.540
<i>Look on up, yeah, look on up at the bottom</i>

01:14:41.790 --> 01:14:45.710
<i>Look on down, look on down at your love</i>

01:14:46.580 --> 01:14:49.540
<i>And you don't give up</i>

01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:04.890
<i>Look on up now</i>

01:15:17.910 --> 01:15:22.870
That's funny, man.
Seriously, though, folks...

01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:26.120
where would we be today
without the great Z-Man Barzell?

01:15:26.290 --> 01:15:28.460
Without Z-Man, where would anyone be?

01:15:28.630 --> 01:15:31.960
You know, sometimes I think he's
secretly the president.

01:15:32.130 --> 01:15:36.300
- You kids gonna sing a song for us now?
- Try and stop us, Gordon.

01:15:36.510 --> 01:15:39.510
It's the title song of our new album,
'Look On Up at the Bottom'.

01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:40.930
Kel?

01:15:41.180 --> 01:15:43.140
- Let's play 'Find It.'
- 'Find It'?

01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:46.050
It would be a way
to say thank you to someone.

01:15:46.230 --> 01:15:47.190
It would be a way
to say thank you to someone.

01:15:47.350 --> 01:15:49.440
For old times' sake?

01:15:49.690 --> 01:15:51.320
<i>Find it</i>

01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:55.320
- Casey?
- I don't mind. I can handle it.

01:15:57.530 --> 01:16:01.410
Well, looks like there's
a slight change of plan.

01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:04.830
We'd like to do a number
that's not in the album.

01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:07.620
It's never been performed on live TV.

01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:12.880
- It's called 'Find It.'
- 'Find It.' Why not? If you can.

01:16:13.130 --> 01:16:17.510
Ladies and gentlemen, The Carrie Nations
singing, for the first time, 'Find It.'

01:16:23.430 --> 01:16:27.230
<i>I turned my eyes to lunatic skies
of red destruction</i>

01:16:27.390 --> 01:16:30.520
<i>Sunrise and morning empty</i>

01:16:30.690 --> 01:16:33.980
<i>Hide my head</i>

01:16:34.230 --> 01:16:36.860
<i>I've got to find a direction to follow</i>

01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:39.780
<i>Something that's mine
not something I borrowed</i>

01:16:39.950 --> 01:16:45.080
<i>Each day I wait heavy's the weight on me</i>

01:16:45.330 --> 01:16:46.790
<i>Find it</i>

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:49.280
<i>I've got to find it</i>

01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:51.960
<i>Get me behind it</i>

01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:56.960
- Cut! Cut!
- No, don't listen to that man!

01:16:57.130 --> 01:16:59.590
Keep those cameras rolling!

01:17:00.010 --> 01:17:03.970
- I don't know what happened here.
- Call an ambulance!

01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:09.140
Get away from him! Leave him alone! No!

01:17:09.310 --> 01:17:12.060
He's seems still, very motionless.
No, he's moving just a bit.

01:17:12.310 --> 01:17:14.360
- Oh my God.
- He's alive.

01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:16.770
Don't move him any more.
I'll get an ambulance.

01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:18.560
Oh my God, no.

01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:20.700
Keep them moving. Keep the cameras moving.

01:17:23.950 --> 01:17:26.740
I've been so full of crap
right from the beginning.

01:17:26.910 --> 01:17:29.410
It wasn't enough for me
to mess up my own life...

01:17:29.620 --> 01:17:32.500
- ...but to screw up Harris's...
- Kelly, everyone's guilty.

01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:37.840
- But he's still alive, isn't he?
- Sometimes you learn too late.

01:17:38.090 --> 01:17:42.720
- I don't give a damn! It's still my fault!
- Don't blame yourself, Kelly.

01:17:42.930 --> 01:17:45.140
What happened to Harris happened
for reasons...

01:17:45.300 --> 01:17:46.840
you don't know anything about.

01:17:47.010 --> 01:17:52.390
- What the hell do you know about it?
- I'm going to have his baby.

01:17:55.310 --> 01:17:58.600
You Mr. Allsworth's friends?
I'm Dr. Scholl.

01:17:58.780 --> 01:18:03.110
Regrettably, we have discovered
traumatic shock to the spinal column...

01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:06.280
resulting in massive nerve dysfunction.

01:18:06.490 --> 01:18:10.330
However, in a very small percentage
of these cases...

01:18:10.540 --> 01:18:13.420
there is spontaneous repair
of the damaged tissue.

01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:16.920
But you must remember,
this is extremely rare.

01:18:17.090 --> 01:18:20.880
With proper rehabilitation, there is every
reason to believe that the patient...

01:18:21.090 --> 01:18:22.970
will adjust, be useful...

01:18:23.130 --> 01:18:25.960
and yes, have a rewarding life
as a paraplegic.

01:18:26.140 --> 01:18:27.180
Oh, God.

01:18:27.550 --> 01:18:32.260
You're just gonna have to relax.
I can't even move you.

01:18:33.980 --> 01:18:36.400
How's that, Casey?

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:39.930
- Roxanne, I...
- Jeanine, would you excuse us?

01:18:40.150 --> 01:18:41.940
- Surely.
- Thank you.

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:48.490
- Come on, let's have it.
- Roxanne, I'm pregnant.

01:18:49.410 --> 01:18:53.910
- How long?
- Two months.

01:18:54.370 --> 01:18:57.750
- You sure? Maybe you're just late.
- The lab report came yesterday...

01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:01.590
You have one of the more
common Hollywood problems.

01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:06.090
- I know a doctor that can help you.
- I don't want an abortion.

01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:08.970
I want this baby.

01:19:09.180 --> 01:19:11.680
It belongs to Harris.

01:19:12.100 --> 01:19:15.100
- To Harris?
- Yes.

01:19:15.310 --> 01:19:18.400
But how can you be sure?

01:19:20.610 --> 01:19:25.150
He's been the only one for months.
He dropped by one night.

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:28.990
He was drunk and I was stoned.

01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:32.370
- You're determined to have the baby?
- I have to.

01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:36.210
After what happened, this could be the
only child Harris could ever conceive.

01:19:36.410 --> 01:19:40.950
And you feel loyalty
toward a man who raped you...

01:19:41.170 --> 01:19:42.800
when you were unconscious?

01:19:43.250 --> 01:19:45.830
It's crazy, but in a funny way I do.

01:19:46.010 --> 01:19:48.220
It's the child of a man you never loved...

01:19:48.430 --> 01:19:50.720
conceived in a moment
you don't even remember.

01:19:50.930 --> 01:19:54.980
- That's easy to say.
- And there's your parents to think about.

01:19:55.140 --> 01:20:00.190
Your father. How will it affect
his career in the Senate?

01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:01.770
I haven't thought about him...

01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:04.900
- Does Harris know?
- No.

01:20:05.110 --> 01:20:08.030
Pet and Kelly do, though.

01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:13.490
One thing's certain, they aren't
going to volunteer the information.

01:20:13.700 --> 01:20:16.120
Not now.

01:20:16.330 --> 01:20:21.840
Casey, it's only your problem.

01:20:25.090 --> 01:20:27.470
- But the baby....
- The doctor is ready.

01:20:27.670 --> 01:20:31.500
- Couldn't I just have one of my dolls?
- Not before, it could be dangerous.

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:32.930
Come on. Come on.

01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:37.890
You'll have to wait here, miss.

01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:42.900
Miss Smith, this is Dr. Downs.

01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:47.780
Miss Smith. There's really nothing
to worry about at all.

01:20:48.030 --> 01:20:49.950
You'll be just as good as new.

01:20:52.990 --> 01:20:55.790
- How about another?
- No, ma'am. Why don't you have one?

01:20:55.990 --> 01:20:58.900
You trying to talk me off my diet?

01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:05.250
What are you waiting for? You'll be late
for class. Expecting company?

01:21:05.420 --> 01:21:08.300
- Not company, roses.
- Roses?

01:21:08.510 --> 01:21:12.260
This is our anniversary.
We've been engaged exactly one week.

01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:14.600
I didn't think you'd remember.

01:21:15.970 --> 01:21:18.980
That'll be them now.

01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:25.020
Well, El Buckaroo.

01:21:25.190 --> 01:21:28.690
I was hoping I'd find you here
to personally thank you...

01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:34.070
- ...for those 30 days in the bucket.
- Who is it, Emerson? The delivery...

01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:36.410
- ...boy?
- Right on.

01:21:36.620 --> 01:21:41.000
- What was it you wanted delivered?
- What the hell are you doing here?

01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:43.280
Just making a little house call.

01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:46.500
My last one got sidetracked
by assault and battery.

01:21:46.710 --> 01:21:49.630
- Randy, please don't cause any trouble.
- Trouble?

01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:54.510
- You got any jam?
- Randy, please leave.

01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:56.850
- No jam at all.
- Man, I think you better leave.

01:21:57.100 --> 01:22:01.020
Don't you bother about me.
I'll just fix me a little snack.

01:22:01.270 --> 01:22:04.770
I'm used to it. You see, I don't have
a chick to fix breakfast for me.

01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:08.940
- So I just fix a little snack of my own.
- Emerson, let me handle this.

01:22:09.190 --> 01:22:14.700
Now that's real cool advice. Since you're
in charge, where should we start?

01:22:14.910 --> 01:22:16.370
Get the hell out of here, man.

01:22:16.530 --> 01:22:20.120
I just don't understand
your change of mood, lady.

01:22:20.290 --> 01:22:25.080
Now, the last time I was up here,
you were in a whole different bag.

01:22:25.290 --> 01:22:28.300
I remember that night so clearly.

01:22:28.460 --> 01:22:31.090
- You were so good...
- I said get the hell...!

01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:34.550
Why, Randy? Why?

01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:38.430
Come now, little lady.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:40.850
- I love him.
- Nothing at all.

01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:44.850
- Why can't you leave us alone?
- Come to Papa.

01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:49.390
Why you little...

01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:58.990
You touch him and I'll cut you! Bastard.

01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:02.120
Now, ain't that just the luck?

01:23:02.290 --> 01:23:04.750
And here I am without a good cut man
in my corner.

01:23:04.910 --> 01:23:09.620
I sure could use old Dan Florio right now,
because without the cut man...

01:23:09.790 --> 01:23:13.960
I might get a little slice under the eye.
Don't mean anything.

01:23:14.130 --> 01:23:20.010
It'd stop the fight.
It don't seem reasonable somehow.

01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:34.690
I'm throwing in the towel.

01:23:35.070 --> 01:23:37.200
Roxanne, you've been so kind.

01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:38.190
I don't know who else

01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:40.820
would have been so wonderful.

01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:44.000
I need you very much.

01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:16.860
Checkmate.

01:24:17.650 --> 01:24:19.770
There is no way I can move.

01:24:19.990 --> 01:24:24.040
- Another game?
- Not just now. Maybe a little later.

01:24:38.170 --> 01:24:43.380
- How do you feel today?
- All right. Maybe a little better.

01:24:43.550 --> 01:24:47.550
- Is all the stiffness gone?
- Pretty much so.

01:24:47.730 --> 01:24:51.310
Look, Kelly, don't feel you have to
stay around here and keep me company.

01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:54.020
You must have a thousand things to do.

01:24:55.570 --> 01:25:00.570
I don't have anything to do that's more
important than this, Harris. Dig?

01:25:00.910 --> 01:25:04.490
You're racing through life
full steam ahead, not giving a damn...

01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:07.330
then something happens
to make you stop short.

01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:10.580
And you realise that people
are what count.

01:25:10.750 --> 01:25:13.750
You're important to me, Harris.

01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:18.040
- I'm available too.
- Swell, Lance. Very good.

01:25:18.260 --> 01:25:20.300
Why don't you hie over
to my place about 9?

01:25:21.970 --> 01:25:24.260
Lance?

01:25:25.810 --> 01:25:29.140
- No way, lady.
- Lance?

01:25:29.310 --> 01:25:32.860
Yeah, I'll see you tonight.

01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:38.820
Roxanne? Why don't you drop
over to my place about 9:00 tonight?

01:25:38.990 --> 01:25:42.740
Bring your little girl. I'm in the mood
for one of my special private parties.

01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:47.040
Since I'd already proposed to her once,
I figured it was just a waste of time.

01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:49.120
Oh, Baxter.

01:25:49.290 --> 01:25:52.830
And strictly as an afterthought,
it occurred to me that...

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:54.590
- ...I loved her.
- Oh.

01:25:54.750 --> 01:25:58.840
Our generation fights the sex revolution
and they get married.

01:25:59.130 --> 01:26:00.300
Ain't that true.

01:26:00.460 --> 01:26:02.670
Are you sure you won't stay
and have dinner?

01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:07.500
No, thanks. I'd say yes, but tonight
calls for champagne and candlelight.

01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:12.690
A toast, a toast, my friends,
to our health and cheer and happiness.

01:26:13.060 --> 01:26:16.400
Otto, let the ritual begin.

01:26:23.530 --> 01:26:28.410
Well done, vassal. Pray, be excused. We
have no further need of your services.

01:26:28.620 --> 01:26:29.830
Turn off the ovens.

01:26:32.580 --> 01:26:34.830
For the queen, so haughty and serene.

01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:38.670
- One, two for you, little page.
- What are these for?

01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:43.010
To sheathe your body for the court.
And a brutal one for the jungle denizen.

01:26:43.220 --> 01:26:46.430
- Come with me. We'll change.
- And the best one of all for me.

01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:51.920
- The things that I do for bread.
- Not gold. Affection. Friendship.

01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:56.230
The strong mutual bond of the round
table. We are the spirits of the dead...

01:26:56.440 --> 01:27:01.940
- ...creatures treading the river Styx.
- I'm here. Doesn't that prove my fealty?

01:27:02.150 --> 01:27:06.160
- Doesn't that satisfy you?
- I accept your fealty and nobly return it...

01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:10.690
and beseech you to get thine ass
in gear and garb your angry loins.

01:27:10.870 --> 01:27:13.410
OK. OK...

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.550
- It is I, Superwoman.
- Far out, Z-Man.

01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:27.220
Not Z-Man, Superwoman.
It bodes nothing unless you're serious.

01:27:27.430 --> 01:27:32.270
- Come now, let us seek Jungle Lad.
- Hey, rube, it's your party. Let's do it.

01:27:32.430 --> 01:27:35.140
Marvellous. It displays you
to such magnificent advantage.

01:27:35.350 --> 01:27:38.150
Let's not be jealous, Z-Man.

01:27:42.150 --> 01:27:43.320
I don't feel so well.

01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:46.810
Only the wine going to your head,
taking those wicked herbs with it.

01:27:47.030 --> 01:27:49.570
- What?
- Ancient potion by Merlin the magician.

01:27:49.740 --> 01:27:52.370
Just add one part peyote
and some other benign goodies.

01:27:52.540 --> 01:27:55.790
- It's used in all the best rituals.
- It's only a small dose, Casey.

01:27:55.960 --> 01:27:57.710
You know how Z-Man is.

01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:03.090
I mean, Superwoman.
Listen, I'll watch out for you.

01:28:03.300 --> 01:28:08.260
No more words, I pray you.
Let the games begin.

01:29:21.540 --> 01:29:23.880
Roxanne?

01:29:31.630 --> 01:29:33.500
Will you watch out for me?

01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:38.930
<i>Beyond the valley of the dolls</i>

01:29:39.180 --> 01:29:43.680
<i>In a corner of the sky</i>

01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:49.030
<i>You are reaching for a cloud</i>

01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:54.370
<i>And another way to fly</i>

01:29:54.570 --> 01:29:58.070
<i>I am love</i>

01:29:59.410 --> 01:30:03.250
<i>And if you respond</i>

01:30:04.460 --> 01:30:12.800
<i>Love can carry you above and beyond</i>

01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:19.770
<i>Beyond the days of now and then</i>

01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:24.350
<i>Far above reality</i>

01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:29.780
<i>There's a gentle afterglow</i>

01:30:30.650 --> 01:30:35.370
<i>That is easier to see</i>

01:30:35.780 --> 01:30:38.740
<i>Come with me</i>

01:30:40.290 --> 01:30:50.170
<i>And you'll be upon the sweet bird of love</i>

01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:53.620
<i>Feeling beautiful</i>

01:30:55.590 --> 01:30:59.630
<i>So unusual</i>

01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:04.220
<i>Come with me</i>

01:31:04.390 --> 01:31:12.930
<i>And you'll be upon the sweet bird of love</i>

01:31:13.690 --> 01:31:17.020
<i>Feeling beautiful</i>

01:31:18.660 --> 01:31:23.250
<i>So unusual</i>

01:31:23.450 --> 01:31:28.120
<i>This feeling of love</i>

01:31:28.710 --> 01:31:34.010
<i>This feeling of love</i>

01:31:35.550 --> 01:31:39.430
- Jungle Lad.
- Ronnie...

01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:43.930
I am really ripped. Cool it.

01:31:44.100 --> 01:31:48.650
- Ronnie? Nay, nay, Superwoman.
- OK.

01:31:48.810 --> 01:31:53.070
OK, Superwoman. Whatever.

01:31:53.610 --> 01:31:56.490
Oh, am I flashing.

01:31:56.650 --> 01:31:59.810
I gotta get my head together.

01:31:59.990 --> 01:32:03.160
Maybe some of that sauce.

01:32:03.370 --> 01:32:07.960
Jungle Lad, is it not sufficient
just to be here locked in embrace...

01:32:08.170 --> 01:32:11.670
in the arms of she
who is every man's dream?

01:32:14.550 --> 01:32:17.130
Who are you to reject Superwoman?

01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:19.760
Why do you react so strangely
in the embrace...

01:32:19.970 --> 01:32:22.350
of the embodiment of carnal desire?

01:32:22.510 --> 01:32:26.130
"Carnal desire" my ass.

01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:37.210
I, who have never before been spurned,
Superwoman.

01:33:37.460 --> 01:33:39.620
You wanna know something? You're right.

01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:44.640
You wanna know something else?
I'm gonna take a downer and crash.

01:33:45.010 --> 01:33:50.100
You varlet. You serf. You buggering knave.

01:33:50.270 --> 01:33:53.730
How dare you cast aside
my alabaster charms...

01:33:53.940 --> 01:33:57.530
my capacious love, my undying troth.

01:33:57.690 --> 01:34:03.450
Yes, I vow it. Ere this night does wane...

01:34:03.610 --> 01:34:08.780
you will drink the black sperm
of my vengeance!

01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:45.120
How now, Jungle Lad?
Why so helpless? And why so frail?

01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:48.700
Where is your much vaunted
muscular prowess?

01:34:48.870 --> 01:34:52.750
I don't know your story.
And I don't wanna know it.

01:34:52.910 --> 01:34:56.200
All I know is, these goddamn ropes
are cutting my wrists...

01:34:56.380 --> 01:34:59.050
- ...and I want out now!
- Growl, vassal.

01:34:59.210 --> 01:35:03.680
You spoil Superwoman's sport
when you whine and succour me.

01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:07.210
Jungle Lad should be silent and mighty,
not a grovelling ant...

01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:09.220
creeping across the malodorous moat.

01:35:09.430 --> 01:35:13.980
Besides, methinks you miss the point.
You are doing what I want...

01:35:14.180 --> 01:35:16.140
exactly what I demand, sir.

01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:19.820
At last the king of the jungle
comes under the imperious rule...

01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:21.860
of she who is unconquerable:

01:35:22.030 --> 01:35:23.900
Superwoman.

01:35:24.110 --> 01:35:27.280
How it excites me, your legendary
strength rendered impotent...

01:35:27.450 --> 01:35:30.160
as you grovel before
the greatest superhero of all time.

01:35:30.410 --> 01:35:32.700
The man's out of his gourd.

01:35:40.210 --> 01:35:45.380
Methinks you remind me of certain things.

01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:47.340
Don't move, you churl.

01:35:47.510 --> 01:35:51.890
Don't move a single muscle
of that finely fleshed body.

01:35:52.100 --> 01:35:54.730
You're a freak, Barzell.
You're a stone freak!

01:35:55.140 --> 01:35:59.310
I'll get you back in spades, Barzell!
I'll get you, you mother!

01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:03.610
The vorpal blade goes snicker-snack!
Yes, Jungle Lad...

01:36:03.780 --> 01:36:09.030
meet my friend Excalibur,
mightiest sword of all time.

01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:13.330
Forged by Woden, the god of time,
legendary blade of King Arthur.

01:36:13.540 --> 01:36:17.080
Hurled into the lake,
it sprang forth again, shining and pure.

01:36:17.290 --> 01:36:22.750
But now, now it is wielded by she
who will eclipse all their deeds...

01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:28.220
Arthur, Lancelot and even mighty
Coeur de Lion, Superwoman!

01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:31.350
Listen, Ronnie. See, this whole thing

01:36:31.550 --> 01:36:34.170
has been a big game.

01:36:34.350 --> 01:36:37.890
Right? A big put on.
We've been putting each other on, man!

01:36:38.060 --> 01:36:42.520
The trouble is, you think it's for
real, but it's not.

01:36:42.690 --> 01:36:49.200
Now, we're friends, aren't we?
Remember, Z-Man? Put the sword away.

01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:53.230
Come on, Z-Man, put it away.
You don't need it.

01:36:56.330 --> 01:36:58.620
Yeah.

01:36:59.750 --> 01:37:04.670
Z-Man? There is no Z-Man, varlet.

01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:11.590
And indeed, it is not a game we play.
I am Superwoman!

01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:20.850
Oh my God. No.

01:37:21.020 --> 01:37:24.520
You've been a broad all along.
Right, Barzell? A goddamn broad!

01:37:24.690 --> 01:37:28.400
A goddamn ugly broad, Barzell!

01:37:28.570 --> 01:37:30.950
An ugly broad!

01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:34.370
No, Ronnie! No!

01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:50.800
Oh, God!

01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:44.730
You beg for mercy...

01:38:44.900 --> 01:38:48.610
while the cries of 6 million innocent
still ring in your ears?

01:38:48.860 --> 01:38:51.240
They are waiting for you.

01:38:54.860 --> 01:38:56.860
Oh God! Oh God!

01:40:05.930 --> 01:40:11.640
So without the Boy Wonder,
my sylph-like friend?

01:40:48.980 --> 01:40:53.110
- Man, this game's fixed.
- Objection. Objection.

01:40:55.150 --> 01:40:58.910
- It's your dime.
- Help me, I'm at Ronnie's...

01:40:59.110 --> 01:41:02.200
and he's flipped out.
He's killing everybody!

01:41:02.450 --> 01:41:06.580
- Calm down, Z-Man's killing what?
- Casey, what's wrong?

01:41:06.790 --> 01:41:10.420
He's killing everybody!
Please, call the police.

01:41:10.620 --> 01:41:16.450
Why turn away from Superwoman,
greatest law enforcer of them all.

01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:19.460
Hang on, Casey. We'll be right there.

01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:22.350
- What's happening?
- Casey needs help. Let's go.

01:42:14.230 --> 01:42:17.150
Stay here, I'm going around the back.

01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:21.070
- Come on, Pet. Let's go.
- Help me out of here.

01:43:27.140 --> 01:43:29.060
She's dead!

01:43:29.300 --> 01:43:32.880
Casey. She's dead.

01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:36.900
He killed her!
And there's someone else inside...

01:43:37.100 --> 01:43:39.850
but I don't know who it is.

01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:44.490
- The head is missing!
- Oh, my God!

01:43:46.820 --> 01:43:51.080
- Kelly?
- Harris! Harris, are you hurt?

01:43:51.330 --> 01:43:55.870
My toes.... I can feel my legs!

01:43:57.290 --> 01:44:01.050
Harris, God!

01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:09.550
- Oh, Harris, you can walk.
- Kelly. Oh, Kelly.

01:44:42.040 --> 01:44:46.370
The act of death has caused
another life to be reborn.

01:44:46.550 --> 01:44:50.140
Together, we share the wonder
of human existence.

01:44:50.340 --> 01:44:53.840
And let there be no doubt
that all of us are brothers.

01:44:54.010 --> 01:44:59.010
There can be no beginning or ending that
does not in some way touch another.

01:44:59.230 --> 01:45:04.110
For our actions affect the lives
and destinies of the many.

01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:08.610
Z-Man: He forgot that life
has many levels...

01:45:08.780 --> 01:45:12.780
and by choosing to live on only one,
lost sight of reality.

01:45:13.450 --> 01:45:17.750
Ashley: Men were toys for her amusement.

01:45:17.950 --> 01:45:22.740
Her total disregard for their feelings
made love a stranger to her.

01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:26.880
Lance Rocke: He never gave of himself.

01:45:27.210 --> 01:45:32.500
Those who only take must be prepared
to pay the highest price of all.

01:45:33.050 --> 01:45:37.170
Porter Hall used his profession
to mask selfish interests...

01:45:37.350 --> 01:45:40.350
to betray the trust
that should have been sacred.

01:45:40.940 --> 01:45:43.770
Susan Lake: Perhaps too pure.

01:45:43.980 --> 01:45:46.190
Excessive goodness can often blind us...

01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:48.610
to the human failings
of those less perfect.

01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:52.190
Emerson found that something
as precious as love...

01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:55.860
brings with it a demand
for greater understanding.

01:45:56.330 --> 01:45:59.410
Casey and Roxanne: Light and shadow.

01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:05.630
Theirs was not an evil relationship.
But evil did come because of it.

01:46:06.210 --> 01:46:09.970
Otto: An end to Martin Bormann?

01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:16.310
Harris: He forgot that yesterday
is only for remembering.

01:46:16.510 --> 01:46:20.010
Those who choose to live there
lose sight of tomorrow.

01:46:20.730 --> 01:46:25.190
Pet's mistake: A fleeting thing,
born of emotion...

01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:28.400
yet it almost ruined the lives
of two others

01:46:28.730 --> 01:46:35.230
Randy's body: A cage for an animal.
It lifted him to the top of his field...

01:46:35.450 --> 01:46:39.410
but in the end,
the beast almost killed him.

01:46:39.660 --> 01:46:43.370
And Kelly? Her selfish involvement...

01:46:43.540 --> 01:46:49.300
so ready to turn her back on
friendship. The road back is painful.

01:46:49.500 --> 01:46:53.080
By her pain, she will never again forget.

01:46:54.510 --> 01:46:59.390
You must each decide
what your life will be.

01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:03.600
You must always know that a hand
extended to your fellow man...

01:47:03.770 --> 01:47:06.020
is a gesture of love.

01:47:06.190 --> 01:47:12.360
Love that asks nothing, expects nothing.
It is simply there.

01:47:12.530 --> 01:47:18.410
And if love is in you,
then gentle will be all your steps...

01:47:18.580 --> 01:47:22.790
as you walk beyond this valley.

01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:26.330
<i>Come with me</i>

01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:35.510
<i>And you'll be upon the sweet bird of love</i>

01:47:35.970 --> 01:47:39.350
<i>Feeling beautiful</i>

01:47:40.350 --> 01:47:43.560
<i>So unusual</i>

01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:48.520
<i>This feeling of love</i>

01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:55.700
They always said there'd be
a first time for everything.

01:47:55.860 --> 01:48:01.080
And this is certainly
our first triple ceremony.

01:48:02.540 --> 01:48:05.410
Just a second, folks.

01:48:08.830 --> 01:48:11.910
It's Porter Hall.

01:48:21.140 --> 01:48:22.770
And now, we shall begin.

01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:28.730
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
this afternoon to unite....

01:48:29.305 --> 01:48:35.341
