Previously on<i>Million Dollar</i>
<i>Listing New York...</i>

00:05.605 --> 00:07.240
I'd like us to take
the next step.

00:08.475 --> 00:11.978
Now, it is time for the biggest
of all decisions.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.546
Who will the egg donor be?

00:13.580 --> 00:15.548
You're gonna be great daddies.

00:16.549 --> 00:18.885
I have a project
on 19th Street.

00:18.918 --> 00:20.687
- Yeah, let's do it.
- I'm looking forward.

00:20.720 --> 00:21.955
We're supposed to do this
together.

00:21.988 --> 00:23.690
Sure, so you can't
come inside and say,

00:23.723 --> 00:24.724
"Hey this is
what we're gonna do.

00:24.758 --> 00:25.959
This is what we're gonna do."

00:25.992 --> 00:27.861
He's, like,
actually being disrespectful.

00:27.894 --> 00:29.829
I mean, I brought him on
to the project.

00:29.863 --> 00:32.599
You have to do five shots
of tequila with me right now.

00:32.632 --> 00:36.002
My current client, Arty,
has been a handful.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.871
I think we could do a nice party
just in the closet, huh?

00:37.904 --> 00:39.873
[laughter]

00:39.906 --> 00:41.408
I think we really need
a tequila now.

00:41.441 --> 00:45.278
We need to have a little talk.

00:45.311 --> 00:46.312
(woman)
Luis...

00:48.581 --> 00:50.950
There's a problem
with the offer.

00:50.984 --> 00:52.719
It just wasn't meant to be
this time.

00:54.788 --> 00:57.757
[upbeat music]

00:57.791 --> 00:59.259
My motto is expansion...

00:59.292 --> 01:02.529
always in all ways.

01:02.562 --> 01:05.799
New York City, it's the most
exciting city for real estate,

01:05.832 --> 01:07.067
and that's why I'm here.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.302
I'm the closer
and a listing machine.

01:09.336 --> 01:11.838
What makes me better is that
I work harder than anyone else.

01:11.871 --> 01:13.073
Whee!

01:13.073 --> 01:14.741
We're friends now.
Right?

01:14.774 --> 01:17.143
I don't need him,
and you don't either.

01:17.177 --> 01:18.912
This will never end.

01:18.945 --> 01:23.383
* *

01:28.088 --> 01:29.823
Tell them I'll meet them
at 4:00 p.m. today.

01:29.856 --> 01:31.091
(Ronita)
Where are you now?

01:31.124 --> 01:33.893
I am on my way to 46 Carmine
in the West Village.

01:33.927 --> 01:37.097
West Village, to me, is poetry.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.298
Imagine the leaves
in the fall,

01:38.331 --> 01:39.666
falling on
those tree-lined streets

01:39.699 --> 01:43.103
with beautiful townhouses
that reminds you of London.

01:43.103 --> 01:46.606
Movies stars, artists, writers.

01:46.639 --> 01:47.741
In the West Village,
there are buildings

01:47.774 --> 01:50.677
that have been built
way before electricity.

01:50.710 --> 01:52.812
Or elevators,
in this case.

01:52.846 --> 01:54.314
- Hello.
- Luis.

01:54.347 --> 01:55.382
Good morning.
Good morning.

01:55.415 --> 01:56.383
- Hi.
- Hello.

01:56.416 --> 01:57.550
- How are you?
- Good to see you.

01:57.584 --> 01:59.019
Muah.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.487
I met Bianca at an art show.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.589
She came to me and told me
that she had an apartment

02:02.622 --> 02:04.124
on Carmine Street
that she needed to sell.

02:04.157 --> 02:05.125
When did you buy this?

02:05.158 --> 02:06.226
1972.

02:06.259 --> 02:07.460
How much?

02:07.494 --> 02:09.329
27,000.

02:09.362 --> 02:10.397
Oh, my God.

02:10.430 --> 02:13.400
[upbeat music]

02:13.433 --> 02:16.803
* *

02:16.836 --> 02:18.605
(Bianca)
Here is a bedroom.

02:18.638 --> 02:19.773
(Luis)
That's actually very cute.

02:19.806 --> 02:20.940
Make yourself at home.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.275
Oh, my God.

02:22.308 --> 02:25.612
[Bianca laughs]

02:25.645 --> 02:26.613
This is a little nook here.

02:26.646 --> 02:29.149
This is very nice.

02:29.182 --> 02:30.917
The exposed brick,
you painted this, I'm assuming?

02:30.950 --> 02:33.753
(Bianca)
Yes, that's the original brick.

02:33.787 --> 02:36.823
This is
a true West Village apartment.

02:36.856 --> 02:40.093
So this apartment is much
smaller and not as luxurious

02:40.093 --> 02:42.095
as most of the listings
that I'm working with right now.

02:42.095 --> 02:43.430
Ah.

02:43.463 --> 02:46.633
But she told me that it was
a very special apartment,

02:46.666 --> 02:49.169
and she was right.

02:49.202 --> 02:51.171
It's a loft
that you can stand up in,

02:51.204 --> 02:52.706
so you've got another skylight.

02:52.739 --> 02:54.007
[exhales deeply]

02:54.107 --> 02:56.142
It's not always
about the commission.

02:56.176 --> 02:59.679
Sometimes it's more about
an apartment that inspires me.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.081
This place, it's--

03:01.114 --> 03:03.049
I don't know, there's something
very artistic about it.

03:03.049 --> 03:04.651
Well, I don't know
if you know this,

03:04.684 --> 03:07.887
but Jackson Pollock
lived here.

03:07.921 --> 03:09.055
So it has
quite a history.

03:09.089 --> 03:11.057
Hold on, Jackson Pollock
lived in this apartment?

03:11.057 --> 03:12.692
Yeah.

03:12.726 --> 03:15.962
(Luis voice-over)
Jackson Pollock is
the ultimate American artist.

03:16.062 --> 03:18.164
He's the splatter painter.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.433
He's like a mix of emotions.

03:20.467 --> 03:23.269
He throws a line of love,
a line of anger,

03:23.303 --> 03:26.973
a line of depression,
a line of passion, fear,

03:27.073 --> 03:29.109
everything,
into one piece of canvas.

03:29.142 --> 03:31.077
Have you found, like,
drips of paint?

03:31.111 --> 03:32.979
No, not really.

03:33.079 --> 03:33.980
Very interesting.

03:34.080 --> 03:35.081
[chuckles]

03:35.081 --> 03:37.517
I am going to find
a drop of paint

03:37.550 --> 03:40.120
from Jackson Pollock
in this apartment,

03:40.153 --> 03:42.088
even if it kills me.

03:42.122 --> 03:45.091
[upbeat music]

03:45.125 --> 03:46.459
You bought this place
for $27,000?

03:46.493 --> 03:47.761
Correct.

03:47.794 --> 03:49.295
I'm assuming anything over
27,000 would make you happy.

03:49.329 --> 03:50.296
Uh, not really.

03:50.330 --> 03:51.364
[both laugh]

03:51.398 --> 03:52.866
I've been waiting
for many years

03:52.899 --> 03:54.234
to sell this place
for the right price.

03:54.267 --> 03:55.669
Okay.
Why are you selling now?

03:55.702 --> 03:57.170
Because the time is right.

03:57.203 --> 03:58.938
I want to make some changes
in my life.

03:58.972 --> 04:00.874
(Luis voice-over)
Bianca has not lived here
for a long time.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.509
She's been renting it out
for a while.

04:02.542 --> 04:04.044
She's ready to cash out.

04:04.044 --> 04:06.346
I think she even wants to invest
the money into another project

04:06.379 --> 04:07.414
that she can renovate.

04:07.447 --> 04:10.417
This is my suggestion.

04:10.450 --> 04:15.522
I think we should price it
at 1.25.

04:15.555 --> 04:18.124
I need you to listen to me.

04:18.158 --> 04:20.193
This is worth more
than what you're saying.

04:20.226 --> 04:22.762
It's worth more than 1.25.

04:22.796 --> 04:25.065
There is nothing like this.

04:25.065 --> 04:26.499
If this was
a luxurious apartment

04:26.533 --> 04:27.701
in a doorman-building,

04:27.734 --> 04:29.369
sitting here on Carmine Street,

04:29.402 --> 04:33.306
I would think 2,500 a foot
at least.

04:33.340 --> 04:35.875
But this is not.

04:35.909 --> 04:37.577
It's a walk-up,
old building.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.946
No doorman.
No amenities.

04:39.979 --> 04:42.816
The strategy is
to create a price that--

04:42.849 --> 04:45.652
it looks very attractive
for something that's so special,

04:45.685 --> 04:49.155
to allow everybody
to go crazy on bidding.

04:49.189 --> 04:52.258
I use this strategy
when I know it will work.

04:52.292 --> 04:55.895
Trust me.

04:55.929 --> 04:58.164
You're making me nervous,

04:58.198 --> 05:01.401
but you are the pro.

05:01.434 --> 05:02.402
We have a deal.

05:02.435 --> 05:03.737
(Luis)
1.25 and then...

05:03.770 --> 05:05.505
- And then up from there.
- Yup.

05:05.538 --> 05:06.806
Okay.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.509
The fact that Jackson Pollock
lived in this apartment

05:09.542 --> 05:11.711
makes the whole world
of a difference.

05:11.745 --> 05:13.747
That means this apartment
has history.

05:13.780 --> 05:15.382
Jackson Pollock.

05:15.415 --> 05:17.851
Jackson [bleep] Pollock.

05:17.884 --> 05:19.252
Are these keys Jackson's?

05:19.285 --> 05:20.720
[laughs]

05:24.290 --> 05:26.359
[upbeat music]

05:26.393 --> 05:29.396
[Ryan humming]

05:29.429 --> 05:31.264
I'm still waiting
on the paperwork from Fredrik

05:31.297 --> 05:34.067
that'll make our co-listing
of 19th Street official.

05:34.067 --> 05:36.102
Brokers usually don't get along
with each other,

05:36.136 --> 05:37.103
especially two firms.

05:37.137 --> 05:38.772
What?
I get along with everyone.

05:38.805 --> 05:40.273
I've never had a fight
with anyone.

05:40.306 --> 05:44.878
So in the meantime, I'm working
with my Russian buyer, Arty.

05:47.213 --> 05:48.181
- What's going on, pal?
- Great to see you.

05:48.214 --> 05:50.083
- Thanks for meeting me.
- How you doing?

05:50.083 --> 05:53.253
(Ryan voice-over)
Arty wants to spend $20 million
on an apartment in New York.

05:53.286 --> 05:55.989
So this week,
I showed him a third property.

05:56.089 --> 05:58.992
[upbeat music]

05:59.092 --> 06:07.033
* *

06:10.070 --> 06:12.038
- Hey.
- Oh.

06:12.072 --> 06:13.873
But surprise, surprise,
surprise.

06:13.907 --> 06:16.543
There were more girls,
more partying...

06:16.576 --> 06:17.777
(Arty)
The girls like to jump.

06:17.811 --> 06:19.045
[laughs]

06:19.045 --> 06:21.214
Which leads
to a very unhappy listing agent.

06:21.247 --> 06:22.782
(Arty)
Are we gonna have to do
a jump here too?

06:22.816 --> 06:24.451
No, we don't have to do jumps
on every stair.

06:24.484 --> 06:25.518
It's fine.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.487
Which leads
to a very unhappy Ryan.

06:27.520 --> 06:29.189
A little bit pissed off
that you didn't let me, uh,

06:29.222 --> 06:30.490
bring all my girls
to this meeting.

06:30.523 --> 06:33.259
Uh, right.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.530
I'm, um--

06:37.564 --> 06:39.065
I just wanted you and I
to sit down

06:39.065 --> 06:41.234
and talk
about the task at hand.

06:41.267 --> 06:42.702
- Okay.
- Um...

06:42.736 --> 06:46.072
In this price range, the brokers
that we've been showing to

06:46.106 --> 06:48.475
take themselves very seriously.

06:48.508 --> 06:51.277
So when we walk in
and I've got all these girls

06:51.311 --> 06:53.747
coming through,
we're kind of partying,

06:53.780 --> 06:57.650
that doesn't really
make us look good.

06:57.684 --> 07:00.120
Right. Honestly, I'm trying
to soak in everything

07:00.153 --> 07:03.023
that you're saying,
and I feel really insulted.

07:03.023 --> 07:04.324
If you don't think
I'm serious enough

07:04.357 --> 07:06.026
and if those girls
really bother you,

07:06.026 --> 07:07.060
it's not a problem.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.462
You know, I can easily find
another broker.

07:09.496 --> 07:12.232
I told you from the beginning,
this is how I do business.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.134
I like to have fun,
and honestly,

07:14.167 --> 07:17.037
I'm really pissed off
right now.

07:17.037 --> 07:19.305
Okay.

07:19.339 --> 07:22.275
Maybe this guy is
more serious than I thought.

07:22.308 --> 07:23.777
You really need
to loosen up.

07:23.810 --> 07:25.478
If we're gonna do business
and we're gonna do this deal,

07:25.512 --> 07:28.448
you really need to loosen up
and have some fun.

07:28.481 --> 07:30.050
Honestly.

07:30.083 --> 07:32.252
(Ryan voice-over)
I'm glad
Arty isn't walking away,

07:32.285 --> 07:34.054
but I got to get
a little tough here.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.555
If we keep doing it his way,

07:35.588 --> 07:37.590
then brokers aren't gonna
want to work with me,

07:37.624 --> 07:40.894
it's gonna sully my reputation,
and I can't have that.

07:40.927 --> 07:42.495
I don't want to lose you
as a client.

07:42.529 --> 07:45.665
And that's not my intention,
but I didn't call you.

07:45.699 --> 07:47.567
You reached out to me.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.703
The difficulty I have
in this situation

07:49.736 --> 07:51.971
is when you show up
with these party girls,

07:52.072 --> 07:53.707
bouncing around,
jumping on beds,

07:53.740 --> 07:56.409
it makes me look like
an idiot.

07:56.443 --> 07:59.346
Listen, I will find you
what you want,

07:59.379 --> 08:02.082
and I will get you
the absolute best deal.

08:02.115 --> 08:05.118
I just need you to leave
the girls behind once.

08:09.889 --> 08:11.825
Let's do it.

08:11.858 --> 08:13.560
Can I have a shot
of Alacrán Tequila, please?

08:17.230 --> 08:18.231
[chuckles]

08:19.366 --> 08:22.335
[funky music]

08:22.369 --> 08:24.537
* *

08:24.571 --> 08:26.573
I think I should just
go to the gym,

08:26.606 --> 08:28.775
while you guys paint away.

08:28.808 --> 08:30.810
Yeah, sure. She's gonna be here
any minute now.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.545
(Fredrik)
The dinner we had
with Ryan and Emilia

08:32.579 --> 08:34.047
turned out to be a lot of fun.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.382
You should do a portrait of her.

08:35.415 --> 08:36.383
(Derek)
Would you want to do that?

08:36.416 --> 08:37.817
A portrait?
Hmm.

08:37.851 --> 08:40.420
I've never done that before.
[laughs]

08:40.453 --> 08:43.857
(Fredrik)
What started at dinner, like,
"I'm going to paint you,"

08:43.890 --> 08:45.358
is now actually happening.

08:45.392 --> 08:47.694
What kind of painting
are you gonna do of her?

08:47.727 --> 08:48.962
[laughs]

08:49.062 --> 08:50.897
Well, it's gonna be
a little bit more abstract.

08:50.930 --> 08:53.233
(Fredrik)
So we have invited Emilia
to be painted

08:53.266 --> 08:57.303
but also to ask her something.

08:57.337 --> 08:58.304
Small.

08:58.338 --> 09:01.841
What if, like, you know...

09:01.875 --> 09:02.842
What?

09:02.876 --> 09:04.044
You weren't thinking it?

09:04.077 --> 09:05.078
What do you mean?

09:14.921 --> 09:15.922
[inhales]

09:17.857 --> 09:19.492
I'm a little bit nervous,

09:19.526 --> 09:20.927
but, I mean, in a good way.

09:21.027 --> 09:23.830
It's like you're putting
yourself emotionally out there.

09:23.863 --> 09:25.298
It's like saying,
"Do you want to marry me?"

09:25.331 --> 09:27.467
or, "I love you.
Do you love me back?"

09:27.500 --> 09:30.437
It's quite exciting,
actually.

09:30.470 --> 09:34.040
These are big things in life,
and I have no idea

09:34.040 --> 09:35.542
how she's gonna take it.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.043
No idea.

09:37.043 --> 09:38.044
Okay, baby, I'm gonna go.

09:38.044 --> 09:40.046
- Mm. Okay.
- Okay.

09:40.046 --> 09:41.114
[knock at door]
- Oh!

09:43.450 --> 09:44.417
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:44.451 --> 09:45.752
Hi, beautiful.
Oh, my God.

09:45.785 --> 09:46.853
Muah.

09:46.886 --> 09:48.621
- Oh.
- I'm on my way to the gym.

09:48.655 --> 09:49.622
But I'll be back soon.

09:49.656 --> 09:50.623
I'm just gonna work out.

09:50.657 --> 09:51.624
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

09:51.658 --> 09:52.726
(Fredrik)
You guys have fun.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.427
Okay.

09:55.662 --> 09:56.830
How are you, sir?
Nice to meet you, pleasure.

09:56.863 --> 09:57.831
(Luis)
Can you feel the vibe?

09:57.864 --> 09:59.065
(Ronita)
I feel it.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.600
There's only one
Jackson Pollock apartment.

10:00.633 --> 10:02.669
I'm afraid you're either gonna
get really pissed off,

10:02.702 --> 10:03.803
or you're just gonna make
a joke out of it.

10:03.837 --> 10:05.005
Are you having a baby?

10:09.109 --> 10:12.078
[upbeat music]

10:12.112 --> 10:13.413
* *

10:13.446 --> 10:15.448
[elevator bell dings]

10:17.050 --> 10:18.418
- Andrew?
- Fredrik?

10:18.451 --> 10:20.687
You got me at, like--
from the gym.

10:20.720 --> 10:21.888
I just need a minute.

10:21.921 --> 10:22.922
Derek and I are having company
right now,

10:22.956 --> 10:24.791
so I have, like, one minute,
literally.

10:24.824 --> 10:27.260
Okay. I have some options here
for you for 19th Street.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.496
The open house
for my co-listing with Ryan

10:29.529 --> 10:31.464
is only a few days away,
and I want everything

10:31.498 --> 10:32.565
to be perfect.

10:32.599 --> 10:34.934
Eklund. Serhant.
Perfection.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.169
Okay, I like this.

10:36.202 --> 10:37.370
Right by the fireplace.

10:37.404 --> 10:39.072
You can even throw it
on the floor if you want.

10:39.105 --> 10:40.607
Is this real fur?

10:40.640 --> 10:42.776
Well, some is,
and then some isn't.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.310
- So we can--
- I don't want any real fur.

10:44.344 --> 10:45.712
Totally fair.

10:45.745 --> 10:47.814
Are you doing any kids element,
like family, like Ryan said?

10:47.847 --> 10:49.783
We want a single guy
and a family

10:49.816 --> 10:50.984
to want to buy this apartment
at the same time.

10:51.017 --> 10:52.519
Keep it neutral.

10:52.552 --> 10:55.455
I think we should go like,
a little bit of rock and roll.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.857
Well, we were thinking
this nice, soft sheepskin.

10:57.891 --> 10:59.292
Yeah, 'cause kids
will like that too.

10:59.325 --> 11:00.393
We want to make
everyone happy.

11:00.427 --> 11:02.062
Yeah.
I feel really good.

11:02.062 --> 11:05.398
I think it's gonna add that
extra oomph to the apartment.

11:05.432 --> 11:06.566
Ryan's gonna be very happy.

11:06.599 --> 11:08.301
- Exactly.
- Everybody gets what they want.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.302
Everybody.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.404
Work your magic.
I have to sell this one.

11:11.438 --> 11:13.073
We, I mean, him and I
have to sell this one.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.374
- Together.
- You will.

11:14.407 --> 11:15.375
(Fredrik)
Thank you.

[playful music]

11:18.411 --> 11:20.113
* *

11:20.146 --> 11:22.248
How are things going, um,
with Ryan?

11:24.150 --> 11:27.487
Ryan works late seven days
a week.

11:27.520 --> 11:31.391
I guess it's something
that I've tried to get used to.

11:31.424 --> 11:34.160
If it's any consolation,
Fred's the same.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.962
Yeah, I can relate.
I understand.

11:35.995 --> 11:37.297
I think we should do this
every week.

11:37.330 --> 11:38.431
Therapy with Derek.

11:38.465 --> 11:40.000
We will call it
"Therapy with Derek."

11:40.100 --> 11:41.001
[chuckles]

11:41.101 --> 11:42.936
[door opens and dog barks]

11:42.969 --> 11:45.205
Hi, babies.

11:45.238 --> 11:47.107
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:47.107 --> 11:48.541
Baby, I love the colors.

11:48.575 --> 11:49.776
(Derek)
Yeah, it's coming along.

11:49.809 --> 11:51.144
Can I sit here?
I'm not gonna ruin--

11:51.177 --> 11:52.979
Yeah, you can sit
over there.

11:53.013 --> 11:54.948
So what's going on
with you guys since dinner?

11:54.981 --> 11:56.149
Since dinner?
With Ryan and I?

11:56.182 --> 11:57.751
(Fredrik)
Mm-hmm.

11:57.784 --> 11:58.785
Nothing much.

12:00.253 --> 12:01.621
I'm glad.
I liked it too.

12:01.654 --> 12:03.723
You guys seem very similar
in a very strange way.

12:03.757 --> 12:05.492
Me and Derek?

12:05.525 --> 12:06.493
You and Ryan.

12:06.526 --> 12:07.560
- Me and Ryan?
- You and Ryan.

12:07.594 --> 12:08.728
- [laughs]
- Well, how is that?

12:08.762 --> 12:11.131
You're both very competitive.

12:11.164 --> 12:12.132
Really?

12:12.165 --> 12:13.867
I've never heard that before.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.535
[laughs]

12:15.568 --> 12:19.539
So...we touched this subject
at dinner

12:19.572 --> 12:21.107
about kids,

12:21.141 --> 12:22.842
and I cannot wait.

12:22.876 --> 12:24.377
But there's just, like,
a few steps

12:24.411 --> 12:26.713
between where we are,
and then...

12:28.682 --> 12:30.383
Of course.

12:30.417 --> 12:33.787
So we've been thinking.

12:33.820 --> 12:35.221
We've been talking.

12:35.255 --> 12:38.224
There is something
that's really important to us

12:38.258 --> 12:40.960
that we want to ask you tonight.

12:40.994 --> 12:44.164
What is it?

12:44.197 --> 12:46.099
We want to ask you...

12:46.099 --> 12:47.734
What?

12:47.767 --> 12:52.939
If you would...

12:52.972 --> 12:56.543
like, give your eggs
to us.

12:56.576 --> 12:57.844
[chuckles]

13:05.085 --> 13:06.586

13:06.619 --> 13:09.522
My eggs?

13:09.556 --> 13:10.757

13:10.790 --> 13:12.826
That's...

13:12.859 --> 13:15.295
* *

13:15.328 --> 13:18.331
That's incredibly flattering.

13:18.365 --> 13:20.600
Because we like you so much,
and you have everything.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.669
You're so beautiful.
You're so intelligent.

13:22.702 --> 13:26.072
We don't ask you to be mother--
the mother.

13:26.106 --> 13:29.376
I mean, you will in one way,
but just--you know.

13:29.409 --> 13:32.912
You have to understand
that this is such a big thing.

13:32.946 --> 13:34.147
(Derek)
Sure.

13:34.180 --> 13:37.083
I mean, I would have
to discuss that with Ryan.

13:37.083 --> 13:39.953
I mean, one day, we're gonna
have children of our own.

13:39.986 --> 13:42.088
That'd be so nice
'cause then they'll be siblings.

13:45.792 --> 13:50.597
I mean, I would have to really
think about something like that.

13:50.630 --> 13:51.765
Is that a maybe?

13:51.798 --> 13:54.668
Definitely,
I will think about it.

13:58.104 --> 14:00.206
I mean,
at least it's not a no.

14:00.240 --> 14:03.276
She'll think about it,
and she'll talk to Ryan.

14:03.309 --> 14:08.181
And as crazy as that sounds,
I mean...

14:08.214 --> 14:10.350
let's see what happens.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.689
(Fredrik)
I'm gonna get some more wine.

14:15.722 --> 14:18.692

14:20.827 --> 14:23.530
Jackson Pollock, Jackson
Pollock, Jackson Pollock.

14:23.563 --> 14:25.231
Can you feel the vibe?

14:25.265 --> 14:26.232
I feel it.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.068
I feel his spirit.

14:28.101 --> 14:30.737
When I listed this apartment,
I used Jackson Pollock's name

14:30.770 --> 14:32.405
front, back, left, and right.

14:32.439 --> 14:34.574
He was my epicenter
of the marketing strategy.

14:34.607 --> 14:36.409
Jackson Pollock's
former apartment.

14:38.712 --> 14:40.180
Then there's a madhouse.

14:40.213 --> 14:41.715
Boom.

14:41.748 --> 14:43.817
There's probably
10 billion other open houses

14:43.850 --> 14:46.152
happening at the same time
on this block,

14:46.186 --> 14:48.321
but there's only one
Jackson Pollock apartment.

14:48.355 --> 14:49.422
All right, let's do this.

14:49.456 --> 14:50.924
Send them up.

14:50.957 --> 14:51.958
(Luis)
Hello, welcome.
Nice to meet you.

14:51.991 --> 14:53.226
Pleasure.
Nice suit.

14:53.259 --> 14:54.327
- Hi, nice to meet--how are you?
- How are you, sir?

14:54.361 --> 14:55.395
Nice to meet you.
Pleasure, pleasure.

14:55.428 --> 14:57.364
Welcome.
Yes, please look around.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.170
Anybody has any questions?

15:04.204 --> 15:05.805
I know that there's some people
that just came in.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.442
Early 1950s,

15:09.476 --> 15:10.744
and it was said
that most of his good work

15:10.777 --> 15:11.945
was actually done
in this building.

15:13.780 --> 15:15.415
You know what, I've been asked
that question a lot.

15:15.448 --> 15:17.450
Uh, I don't--
I haven't found one.

15:17.484 --> 15:18.718
Okay.

15:18.752 --> 15:20.153
This exactly what
I was expecting.

15:20.186 --> 15:22.055
A lot of questions.
So, everybody, stand in line.

15:22.055 --> 15:25.158
Shoot, 'cause Professor Ortiz
has arrived.

15:25.191 --> 15:26.593
This is 800 square feet.

15:26.626 --> 15:29.095
It's obviously
on Carmine Street, 46.

15:29.129 --> 15:31.664
46 was actually Jackson
Pollock's favorite number.

15:31.698 --> 15:32.932
Hmm.

15:32.966 --> 15:34.734
In fact, in most of the research
that I've done,

15:34.768 --> 15:37.671
four and sixes were incorporated
into much of his work.

15:37.704 --> 15:38.705
Wow.

15:41.074 --> 15:42.275
Wow.
A lot of people.

15:42.308 --> 15:43.877
Come.
Spread this way.

15:43.910 --> 15:45.178
See, we created this buzz.

15:45.211 --> 15:46.613
- I know.
- That's what's exciting.

15:46.646 --> 15:49.849
I told Bianca that my strategy
was to price low

15:49.883 --> 15:50.850
and aim high.

15:50.884 --> 15:51.851
- How are you?
- How are you?

15:51.885 --> 15:52.919
- Muah. Muah.
- Muah.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.120
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

15:54.154 --> 15:55.822
Step one is to get
as many people as possible

15:55.855 --> 15:57.190
through the door--
check.

15:57.223 --> 15:58.458
You have wood-burning fireplace.

15:58.491 --> 15:59.592
The only reason
you can have this

15:59.626 --> 16:00.660
is because you're
on the top floor.

16:00.694 --> 16:02.529
Master bed is here.

16:02.562 --> 16:03.563
Yes.

16:05.598 --> 16:06.733
Okay.

16:15.508 --> 16:16.943
The good news is that
when you have that many people

16:17.043 --> 16:18.345
in the same open house,

16:18.378 --> 16:20.246
you can afford
to have some people not like it,

16:20.280 --> 16:22.849
so I'm going to focus
on those who do.

16:22.882 --> 16:24.951
It's so bright and sunny,
even though it's not huge.

16:25.051 --> 16:26.653
- Yes.
- It's gorgeous.

16:26.686 --> 16:28.054
And the ones who love it,
I'm gonna make sure

16:28.088 --> 16:29.189
that they love it even more.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.826
Absolutely.

16:32.859 --> 16:33.827

Cute, right?

16:33.860 --> 16:35.729
(Luis)
Yeah.

16:35.762 --> 16:37.864
- Wow, this is beautiful.
- Oh, my God.

16:39.799 --> 16:41.735
You wouldn't have to leave
the city ever.

16:41.768 --> 16:44.304
What I need to do is to make
everybody love this apartment

16:44.337 --> 16:46.373
so much that they feel
that they're going to lose it

16:46.406 --> 16:49.642
to everybody that's around them,
so they need to act fast.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.311
Do you have a buyer for this?

16:51.344 --> 16:52.746
(Luis)
Would you live here?

16:52.779 --> 16:54.147
I would too, actually.

16:54.180 --> 16:55.148
Yeah.

16:55.181 --> 16:57.083
Do I hear a starting bid
at 1.25?

16:57.083 --> 16:58.251
Everybody's already
calling buyers.

16:58.284 --> 16:59.786
I can hear them.

16:59.819 --> 17:01.087
- [laughs]
- Yeah.

17:08.461 --> 17:11.364
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:11.398 --> 17:13.266
You were sound asleep
when I got home last night.

17:13.299 --> 17:14.267
How was your day?

17:14.300 --> 17:16.036
Insane.

17:16.069 --> 17:17.404
How about you?

17:17.437 --> 17:20.073
I called Fredrik
about 19th Street.

17:20.106 --> 17:21.174
Yeah?

17:21.207 --> 17:23.777
And he, like, brushed me off
on the phone.

17:23.810 --> 17:24.844
'Cause he still
hasn't sent me

17:24.878 --> 17:26.212
the agreement
or anything like that.

17:26.246 --> 17:29.082
So you haven't really, like,
talked with Fredrik.

17:29.115 --> 17:30.517
I think it's a cool project.

17:30.550 --> 17:31.584
I'll do it.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.053
I mean,
maybe about other things?

17:33.053 --> 17:35.321
He's a little--he's difficult
to work with, but...

17:35.355 --> 17:40.260
Okay, so I'm gonna
tell you something.

17:40.293 --> 17:42.796
But you have to remember
to be open-minded.

17:42.829 --> 17:45.365
I'm not open-minded.

17:45.398 --> 17:48.068
Okay. I'm afraid you're either
gonna get really pissed off,

17:48.068 --> 17:49.235
or you're just gonna make a joke
out of it.

17:49.269 --> 17:50.570
Are you having a baby?

17:50.603 --> 17:52.339
No, I'm not having a baby.

17:52.372 --> 17:55.542
Okay, so when
I went over to the house,

17:55.575 --> 17:58.545
they asked me
whether I would be interested

17:58.578 --> 18:01.381
in donating my eggs to them.

18:05.018 --> 18:07.921
[suspenseful music]

18:08.021 --> 18:09.823
* *

18:09.856 --> 18:12.025
They--they asked--
they asked what?

18:12.058 --> 18:13.259
Are you serious?

18:13.293 --> 18:14.627
No, serious.
100%.

18:14.661 --> 18:16.429
Very, very serious.

18:16.463 --> 18:17.630
Like, really sincere.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.065
Like, really...

18:19.099 --> 18:20.300
I kind of feel like
you're punking me

18:20.333 --> 18:21.801
just to see what my reaction's
gonna be.

18:21.835 --> 18:24.938
I'm not punking you.

18:25.038 --> 18:27.374
The majority of my, uh--

18:27.407 --> 18:29.042
my professional life
as a real estate broker,

18:29.042 --> 18:31.644
Fredrik and I
have been mortal enemies.

18:31.678 --> 18:32.779
So I don't think it's weird
at all

18:32.812 --> 18:35.648
that he wants
my girlfriend's eggs.

18:35.682 --> 18:39.152
[chortles]

18:39.185 --> 18:40.620
They're two people out there

18:40.653 --> 18:42.789
that really want
to have a kid, and...

18:42.822 --> 18:44.190
I get it.

18:44.224 --> 18:45.358
It's kind of sweet
and overwhelming

18:45.392 --> 18:47.360
and everything at once.

18:47.394 --> 18:48.428
I think it's a little weird
that they haven't,

18:48.461 --> 18:49.829
like, taken you out more.

18:49.863 --> 18:52.499
If they're gonna start, like,
making your babies,

18:52.532 --> 18:54.234
don't you think,
dinner number two,

18:54.267 --> 18:55.335
Six Flags or something?

18:55.368 --> 18:57.570
[laughs]
My God.

18:57.604 --> 19:00.640
I--I don't really know
what to say.

19:00.674 --> 19:02.575
When Emilia and I
then have a kid,

19:02.609 --> 19:07.280
my kid will be, like,
brother or sister

19:07.313 --> 19:09.516
with Fredrik's kid.

19:09.549 --> 19:13.920
What do you think I should do
about this though?

19:14.020 --> 19:16.189
Say it's something you're not
comfortable with.

19:16.222 --> 19:20.026
And say, if you are comfortable
doing it, you want $10 million.

19:20.026 --> 19:21.227
Okay, you're not taking this--

19:21.261 --> 19:22.696
I am taking this
very seriously.

19:22.729 --> 19:25.665
I think
it's a very serious discussion.

19:25.699 --> 19:26.766
No.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.201
They're my eggs.

19:32.672 --> 19:33.773
[chuckles]

19:33.807 --> 19:35.075
- What?
- [laughs] God.

19:40.580 --> 19:42.282
Do you ask a lot of people
for their eggs?

19:42.315 --> 19:45.051
(Fredrik)
You have no idea
what we have to go through.

19:49.122 --> 19:52.625
[hip-hop music]

19:52.659 --> 19:54.194
You want to be above the city.

19:54.227 --> 19:55.662
You want brand-new.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.597
You want something that you can
possibly make your own

19:57.630 --> 19:58.598
that's kind of neutral, right?

19:58.631 --> 19:59.799
I do.

19:59.833 --> 20:02.769
Between Fredrik asking Emilia
for her eggs

20:02.802 --> 20:06.006
and Arty and all
of his crazy girlfriends...

20:06.039 --> 20:07.340
Ryan, come, come.

20:07.374 --> 20:10.543
I feel like I've stepped
in to some crazy twilight zone.

20:10.577 --> 20:13.246
You also want something really,
really sexy.

20:13.279 --> 20:15.615
So far, Arty has proven
to be a guy

20:15.648 --> 20:17.384
who is not easily impressed.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.419
Honestly, the view's not really
what I like.

20:19.452 --> 20:20.453
I want to be
on top of the city.

20:20.487 --> 20:21.654
Sure.

20:21.688 --> 20:22.889
I want to feel like
I'm on top of the world.

20:22.922 --> 20:26.793
So this showing is a gamble
to say the least.

20:26.826 --> 20:29.329
This is going to change
your life.

20:29.362 --> 20:30.330
Really?

20:30.363 --> 20:32.832
Yeah, and it's right there.

20:32.866 --> 20:34.067
Where?

20:34.100 --> 20:35.135
In there.

20:35.168 --> 20:36.703
This is it.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.304
(Arty)
What the hell is this?

20:38.338 --> 20:40.140
I thought you were gonna show me
something big.

20:40.173 --> 20:41.708
Something high.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.043
(Ryan)
That's why we're going
to the sales office.

20:43.076 --> 20:44.177
You got to think big, man.

20:44.210 --> 20:45.245
This is what I do.

20:45.278 --> 20:46.946
I show you dreams.
This is the dream.

20:46.980 --> 20:48.982
And you're gonna love it!

20:49.015 --> 20:50.717
Typically, I would wait
until a building

20:50.750 --> 20:53.953
is a little more done before
showing a client the units.

20:53.987 --> 20:56.423
But 50 West is very different.

20:56.456 --> 20:59.159
Their sales office costs
over $2 million.

20:59.192 --> 21:00.927
It's definitely worth
the showing.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.096
I would like to show you
a little bit of my building.

21:03.129 --> 21:04.197
Come and take a look
at the model.

21:04.230 --> 21:07.233
[upbeat music]

21:12.138 --> 21:15.842
I wish I could see something
more substantial.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.144
Everything here is
actually high tech.

21:18.178 --> 21:22.382
Let's take a look at how views
would look from your apartment.

21:22.415 --> 21:23.950
[screen beeps]

21:23.983 --> 21:25.652
Take a look at it.

21:25.685 --> 21:30.090
Hey, that's a view, Ryan.
That's a view.

21:30.090 --> 21:31.758
(Ryan)
That's what I'm talking about.

21:31.791 --> 21:35.428
If there is one thing
that rich young guys like,

21:35.462 --> 21:37.263
it's high-tech gadgets.

21:37.297 --> 21:38.264
I love it.

21:38.298 --> 21:39.332
Do you think maybe
we should leave

21:39.366 --> 21:40.567
and try to find something
a little--

21:40.600 --> 21:41.935
- No, no. Let's keep going.
- Okay, okay.

21:41.968 --> 21:45.205
It's, like, from the future.
Everything is touch pad.

21:45.238 --> 21:46.773
Things are lighting up.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.108
(Arty)
Wow.

21:48.141 --> 21:51.378
I mean, it's like
you're inside a spaceship.

21:51.411 --> 21:52.912
Everything looks good.

21:52.946 --> 21:55.648
I wish I could see something
more, uh, what I'm paying for.

21:55.682 --> 21:56.783
Arty, I have that for you.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.151
Hold on.
[snaps fingers]

21:58.184 --> 21:59.285
[ethereal music]

21:59.319 --> 22:02.455
- Oh.
- Come with me.

22:02.489 --> 22:03.456
Wow.

22:03.490 --> 22:05.291
[electronic music]

22:05.325 --> 22:08.061
Now you can see an actual--
finishes of this apartment.

22:08.094 --> 22:09.129
Now we're talking.

22:09.162 --> 22:16.870
* *

22:16.903 --> 22:20.907
This isn't just an apartment.
It's the entire floor.

22:20.940 --> 22:25.078
The whole floor for Arty
and his gaggle of females.

22:25.078 --> 22:26.346
You have the finishes.

22:27.847 --> 22:28.815
Very nice.

22:28.848 --> 22:34.287
* *

22:34.320 --> 22:35.321
Take a look at it.
Feel it.

22:35.355 --> 22:37.090
It's just something--
You see?

22:37.090 --> 22:38.558
- Feels great.
- Smooth, huh? Smooth.

22:39.959 --> 22:43.096
[pops lips]
It's perfect for him.

22:43.096 --> 22:44.097
I'm very excited, guys.

22:44.130 --> 22:45.899
- Great.
- I think it's a done deal.

22:47.567 --> 22:49.202
(Ryan)
Want to put, maybe,
deal memos together?

22:52.105 --> 22:57.243
I need to ask my girlfriends
before I do anything.

22:57.277 --> 22:58.244
All of them?

22:58.278 --> 22:59.245
All of them.

22:59.279 --> 23:01.047
How many you have?

23:01.047 --> 23:04.050
[laughter]

23:06.453 --> 23:09.756
[upbeat music]

23:09.789 --> 23:12.492
[tires screeching]

23:12.525 --> 23:13.660
[elevator bell dings]

23:13.693 --> 23:15.895
Only one day since my open house
at 46 Carmine,

23:15.929 --> 23:17.664
and my inbox is on fire.

23:17.697 --> 23:19.065
Good morning.

23:20.800 --> 23:23.703
Roni, talk to me.
What do we got?

23:23.737 --> 23:25.138
Six offers.

23:25.171 --> 23:26.406
Okay, that's amazing.

23:26.439 --> 23:28.875
Thank you, thank you, thank you,
Jackson Pollock.

23:28.908 --> 23:30.076
Break them down to me.

23:30.110 --> 23:32.479
Okay, so 1.25 cash,
he's an architect,

23:32.512 --> 23:33.947
but he's currently looking
for a job.

23:33.980 --> 23:35.849
1.25 cash.

23:35.882 --> 23:38.518
This is parents
buying for children.

23:38.551 --> 23:39.519
That sounds like a charity.

23:39.552 --> 23:40.754
Is he a charity case?

23:40.787 --> 23:41.755
- No.
- Okay.

23:41.788 --> 23:42.956
She's actually an artist.

23:42.989 --> 23:45.191
I like artists.
So let's do something.

23:45.225 --> 23:48.461
Send them an email telling them
that we've had multiple offers,

23:48.495 --> 23:51.464
at full ask, and at this point,
we're gonna take best and final.

23:51.498 --> 23:52.732
The good thing
about having six offers

23:52.766 --> 23:53.900
is that you know
for a fact

23:53.933 --> 23:55.168
that you're gonna have
a good backup.

23:55.201 --> 23:58.238
Have them send you best terms,
best numbers...

23:58.271 --> 24:02.442
But I am personally going
to focus on the best two offers

24:02.475 --> 24:03.877
that I have on the table--

24:03.910 --> 24:07.047
the ones that are full ask,
fully qualified, and all cash.

24:07.080 --> 24:08.381
Let's start our job.

24:08.415 --> 24:09.449
Bidding war.

24:09.482 --> 24:11.384
This is the part that I love.

24:11.418 --> 24:12.819
This is the part
that I love.

24:12.852 --> 24:14.487
This is the part that I love.

24:14.521 --> 24:17.357
[phone line rings]

24:17.390 --> 24:19.659
[fingers drumming]

24:19.693 --> 24:21.327
I promised Bianca
that I was going to get her

24:21.361 --> 24:23.263
multiple offers,
which I did.

24:23.296 --> 24:25.899
Now, the question is,
how high can we go?

24:25.932 --> 24:27.934
- Rebecca?
- Yes.

24:27.967 --> 24:29.736
Luis Ortiz.
How are you?

24:29.769 --> 24:32.138
Brendan, I got your offer.
Thank you very much.

24:32.172 --> 24:34.674
This is the situation.
We have six offers.

24:34.708 --> 24:35.942
Talk to your buyer.

24:35.975 --> 24:38.378
Just give me your best, best,
and highest offer.

24:38.411 --> 24:40.413
I need an answer and soon.

24:42.482 --> 24:44.351
Thank you so much.

24:44.384 --> 24:45.952
Beautiful.
Can you see it?

24:45.985 --> 24:47.520
Can you feel it?

24:47.554 --> 24:48.788
- Spirit fingers?
- No, no, no.

24:48.822 --> 24:51.624
Impatience, like,
you create this, um, urgency.

24:51.658 --> 24:53.460
- Urgency.
- Yes, the urgency.

24:53.493 --> 24:54.794
Did you send an email?

24:54.828 --> 24:55.962
Yes.

24:55.995 --> 24:58.431
Okay, beautiful.

24:58.465 --> 24:59.833
And now we wait.

24:59.866 --> 25:02.836
[suspenseful music]

25:02.869 --> 25:04.671
* *

25:04.704 --> 25:05.672
And wait.

25:05.705 --> 25:07.540
* *

25:07.574 --> 25:09.676
I don't like waiting.

25:09.709 --> 25:11.711
[snapping fingers]
Why is nobody calling me back?

25:11.745 --> 25:14.080
[sighs]

25:18.251 --> 25:21.054
(Fredrik)
So Ryan is on his way here.

25:21.054 --> 25:23.356
I have a problem
with the contract.

25:23.390 --> 25:24.858
West 19th.

25:24.891 --> 25:27.260
As often
in New York real estate,

25:27.293 --> 25:28.795
attorneys get involved,
and things get

25:28.828 --> 25:32.332
a little bit complicated
and takes its sweet time.

25:32.365 --> 25:35.068
Co-exclusives
on resale apartments

25:35.068 --> 25:36.236
are done all the time.

25:36.269 --> 25:39.139
But 138 West 19th Street
is a new development,

25:39.172 --> 25:42.142
and new development agreements
are super complicated.

25:42.175 --> 25:45.578
The problem is,
I see an opening

25:45.612 --> 25:47.814
for us to go back
to where we were.

25:47.847 --> 25:49.482
That's the last thing I need
right now,

25:49.516 --> 25:50.650
when we're finally
in a good place.

25:50.684 --> 25:52.252
Well...

25:53.286 --> 25:56.289
[humming]

25:56.322 --> 25:57.624
Hello.

25:57.657 --> 25:58.825
Fredrik called
a business meeting,

25:58.858 --> 26:01.661
which is what I hope it is,
just business,

26:01.695 --> 26:03.463
because I don't want to talk
about eggs.

26:03.496 --> 26:04.931
Good to see you.
Let's talk about the staging.

26:05.031 --> 26:07.133
What's going on with it?
Let's talk about our agreement.

26:07.167 --> 26:08.134
Where is it?

26:08.168 --> 26:10.470
I want to talk
about 19th Street.

26:10.503 --> 26:12.572
So, um, thanks for coming.

26:12.605 --> 26:17.277
Um, Emilia called me,
and she said it was a no.

26:19.279 --> 26:20.246
I guess so.
I don't know.

26:20.280 --> 26:22.048
She said she was
going to reach out.

26:22.048 --> 26:25.185
We knew, with Emilia,
it was going to be a long shot.

26:25.218 --> 26:27.921
At the same time, this is
the third person that we asked,

26:27.954 --> 26:29.923
so we were hoping.

26:29.956 --> 26:32.058
You know,
still love her.

26:32.058 --> 26:33.560
I understand.

26:33.593 --> 26:35.729
Do you ask a lot of people
for their eggs?

26:35.762 --> 26:37.397
(Fredrik)
We've asked a couple, yeah.

26:37.430 --> 26:39.666
You know, that's what we have
to do unfortunately, because--

26:39.699 --> 26:41.501
Oh, no, I get it.
I just, I mean--

26:41.534 --> 26:42.769
I just think it's weird, no?

26:42.802 --> 26:44.838
Given our past
and our relationship.

26:44.871 --> 26:46.639
You didn't CC me
on an email.

26:46.673 --> 26:49.609
You know, you didn't call me.

26:49.642 --> 26:50.910
(Fredrik)
He's only thinking of himself.

26:50.944 --> 26:52.445
You know what I mean?
It's like...

26:52.479 --> 26:54.514
You have no idea
what we have to go through.

26:54.547 --> 26:55.949
It was actually
really beautiful.

26:55.982 --> 26:57.817
The way she reacted
and the way I felt--

26:57.851 --> 27:00.153
or we felt when we said it.

27:00.186 --> 27:03.089
Listen, I want Fredrik and Derek
to find the right donor.

27:03.123 --> 27:04.824
I really, really do.

27:04.858 --> 27:10.130
I just kind of don't want it
to be my girlfriend.

27:10.163 --> 27:12.532
So the second thing is,
19th Street.

27:12.565 --> 27:15.402
Um, the contract,
it's complicated.

27:15.435 --> 27:17.937
Two firms,
new development.

27:18.038 --> 27:19.172
I don't think
it's gonna work out.

27:19.205 --> 27:22.776
[dramatic music]

27:22.809 --> 27:24.411
Why are you looking at me
like that?

27:24.444 --> 27:27.881
I'm not looking at you
like anything.

27:27.914 --> 27:30.450
So is this because you already
have offers and--

27:30.483 --> 27:31.451
just so that I know,

27:31.484 --> 27:32.552
- going forward...
- No.

27:32.585 --> 27:33.920
That there's already money
on the table.

27:33.953 --> 27:35.355
No.

27:35.388 --> 27:37.290
Sure.

27:37.323 --> 27:40.160
I was really hoping
for this co-listing to work out

27:40.193 --> 27:41.561
between Ryan and me--
I really did.

27:41.594 --> 27:43.797
But the attorneys,
what can I do?

27:43.830 --> 27:45.899
They didn't agree
on the contract.

27:45.932 --> 27:48.234
I don't want to go back
where we were before.

27:48.268 --> 27:49.235
Uh-huh.

27:49.269 --> 27:50.937
And I like the new Ryan,
the new Fredrik.

27:50.970 --> 27:53.306
We're friends now, right?

27:53.340 --> 27:56.309
* *

27:56.343 --> 27:58.812
Uh, just so that you know
how I feel,

27:58.845 --> 28:03.083
the way it seems to me is that,
"Oh, maybe this will sell."

28:03.116 --> 28:04.084
And you didn't need me
anymore.

28:04.117 --> 28:05.418
No, it has nothing to do
with that, Ryan.

28:05.452 --> 28:06.486
It has nothing to do with--
it's gonna sell or not.

28:06.519 --> 28:07.554
Are you sure?

28:07.587 --> 28:10.590
We haven't sold anything,
so no.

28:10.623 --> 28:11.858
I don't want to be paranoid,

28:11.891 --> 28:14.361
but I know
what this guy's capable of.

28:14.394 --> 28:16.062
He's, like, lied and cheated
and stealed

28:16.096 --> 28:17.630
to get where he wants to be.

28:17.664 --> 28:19.065
I've lived through it.

28:19.099 --> 28:20.767
I wish you the best of luck.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.535
And you can sell at 19th Street
and keep all the money

28:22.569 --> 28:24.938
and use my staging ideas.

28:25.038 --> 28:26.840
So we're good, man.
We are on the same page.

28:32.278 --> 28:36.449
Thank you, Fredrik,
for wasting my time.

28:40.153 --> 28:41.588
I really like the apartment.

28:41.621 --> 28:43.056
If you win, I buy.

28:43.056 --> 28:44.891
If I win, I fly.

28:44.924 --> 28:46.259
- Go!
- 20 million bucks,

28:46.292 --> 28:48.862
here I come, baby!
[laughs]

28:54.234 --> 28:57.137
[playful music]

28:57.170 --> 28:58.505
Put an almond in my mouth?

28:58.538 --> 28:59.639
(Ronita)
What's an "al-mond"?

28:59.673 --> 29:01.007
It's "all-mond."

29:01.007 --> 29:02.709
- "All-mond."
- "Al-mond."

29:02.742 --> 29:04.444
- "All-mond."
- "Ol-mond."

29:04.477 --> 29:05.545
- "All-mond."
- Jus throw it.

29:05.578 --> 29:08.148
[laughs]

29:08.181 --> 29:09.683
- Holy [bleep]!
- Mmm. Ha!

29:09.716 --> 29:11.017
[laughs]

29:11.051 --> 29:12.018
Love it.

29:12.052 --> 29:13.420
[laughter]

29:13.453 --> 29:14.821
(Ronita)
How did you do that?

29:14.854 --> 29:16.456
I don't know whether
it's the offers, you know,

29:16.489 --> 29:17.457
or the chaos.

29:17.490 --> 29:19.025
(Ronita)
That was a terrible throw.

29:19.025 --> 29:21.094
That was a great catch.
"Al-mond."

29:25.131 --> 29:28.101
[upbeat music]

29:28.134 --> 29:30.570
* *

29:30.603 --> 29:31.938
All right, Ronita,
let's see if we can get him up

29:32.038 --> 29:33.039
and wrap this up.

29:33.073 --> 29:34.307
- Thank you.
- There you go.

29:34.341 --> 29:35.475
Let's do this.

29:35.508 --> 29:37.410
The highest offer I have
for 46 Carmine right now

29:37.444 --> 29:39.045
is $1.4 million, cash.

29:44.551 --> 29:46.052
Okay, thank you so much.

29:46.052 --> 29:48.355
- 1.4, 1.4!
- Awesome.

29:48.388 --> 29:50.156
But the broker
that gave me that offer

29:50.190 --> 29:53.893
has told me that her client
cannot go any higher than that.

29:53.927 --> 29:56.129
That's their ceiling.

29:56.162 --> 29:57.297
- Brendan, how are you?
- Luis, Ronita.

29:57.330 --> 29:58.565
- Good morning, good morning.
- Good morning.

29:58.598 --> 29:59.599
- How are you? Good to see you.
- How are you, sir?

29:59.632 --> 30:00.600
- Ronita. You know Ronita.
- Hello.

30:00.633 --> 30:01.801
Good morning.

30:01.835 --> 30:03.436
Brendan represents
our second highest offer.

30:09.042 --> 30:10.977
Uh, Brendan, unfortunately,

30:11.011 --> 30:14.414
we have a much higher offer
than that.

30:14.447 --> 30:16.082
The fact that Brendan
has called me to meet me

30:16.116 --> 30:18.385
tells me that
this guy's not done yet.

30:18.418 --> 30:20.553
Maybe I can get him over 1.4.

30:20.587 --> 30:24.090
So what do we need to do
to get this done?

30:24.124 --> 30:25.792
I promised Bianca I was gonna
get it over asking,

30:25.825 --> 30:27.494
which I already have.

30:27.527 --> 30:29.362
But I'm not satisfied yet.

30:29.396 --> 30:31.464
There's a magic number
that I have in mind.

30:31.498 --> 30:33.967
46 was actually Jackson
Pollock's favorite number.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.536
Huh.

30:36.569 --> 30:39.339
If you give me 1.46,
we got a deal.

30:39.372 --> 30:41.975
1.46 is, uh,
too high, Luis.

30:42.008 --> 30:44.978
[dramatic music]

30:45.011 --> 30:46.312
That's the number
that I need.

30:46.346 --> 30:48.248
If I don't get that number,
as much as I like you...

30:51.685 --> 30:53.319
Listen, let me make
a phone call.

30:53.353 --> 30:56.222
I'll see what I can do.

30:56.256 --> 30:59.259
What do you think?

30:59.292 --> 31:00.326
You think we'll get that 1.46?

31:00.360 --> 31:03.930
I mean, it would be genius
if we did.

31:03.963 --> 31:06.933
[dramatic music]

31:06.966 --> 31:09.402
* *

31:09.436 --> 31:10.537
I need assurance.

31:10.570 --> 31:12.605
Complete assurance that
this is gonna do it.

31:12.639 --> 31:14.240
No more back and forth.

31:14.274 --> 31:15.575
No counter-offers coming in.

31:15.608 --> 31:17.177
There is a reputation
for me to protect.

31:17.210 --> 31:18.812
And there's nothing I have ever
promised or given my word for

31:18.845 --> 31:20.814
that I've never
come through with.

31:20.847 --> 31:22.482
And I have your word
on 1.46?

31:22.515 --> 31:24.417
1.46.

31:24.451 --> 31:26.186
(Luis voice-over)
This is the beauty
about multiple offers.

31:26.219 --> 31:27.520
I can gamble as much as I like

31:27.554 --> 31:30.123
because I already have
$1.4 million locked up.

31:30.156 --> 31:31.958
But if I can get 1.46,
it's great

31:31.991 --> 31:33.660
because I get my client
more money,

31:33.693 --> 31:36.863
and it's just a beautiful story
for the rest of the world.

31:36.896 --> 31:39.866
[dramatic music]

31:39.899 --> 31:43.103

31:43.136 --> 31:44.137
Let's break bread.

31:44.170 --> 31:45.638
- We have a deal.
- Ah.

31:45.672 --> 31:46.639
- Nice.
- We have a deal.

31:46.673 --> 31:47.640
- Thank you.
- All right.

31:47.674 --> 31:49.409
Boom!
Yes!

31:49.442 --> 31:51.177
We have a deal!

31:51.211 --> 31:52.345
Now give me some of that paint,

31:52.379 --> 31:55.115
so I can start throwing
like Jackson Pollock.

31:55.115 --> 31:56.282
Is that how you do it?

31:56.316 --> 31:57.384
That's how he does it, right?

31:57.417 --> 31:58.952
Something like that.

31:58.985 --> 31:59.953
- Good choice, my man.
- Great.

32:00.053 --> 32:00.954
- Good choice.
- Yeah.

32:01.054 --> 32:02.355
That's right.

32:02.389 --> 32:03.356
1.46.

32:03.390 --> 32:05.425
Keeping history alive.
I love it.

32:10.163 --> 32:11.197
(Ryan)
Pull up left. Left.

32:11.231 --> 32:12.732
Here to your left.
That's fine.

32:12.766 --> 32:14.768
(Ryan voice-over)
Now that 19th Street
is off the table,

32:14.801 --> 32:18.438
I can just put all of my focus
on Arty, which is awesome,

32:18.471 --> 32:21.508
because after our high-tech
showing at 50 West Street,

32:21.541 --> 32:24.310
he called me
and said that he wants it.

32:24.344 --> 32:25.812
The girlfriends approve,

32:25.845 --> 32:27.714
and he's willing to pay
full ask.

32:30.316 --> 32:32.686
But he said under one condition,

32:32.719 --> 32:33.687
and then he hung up the phone,

32:33.720 --> 32:35.422
and I have no idea
what that means.

32:35.455 --> 32:37.190
Hey.

32:37.223 --> 32:38.558
You guys going somewhere?

32:38.591 --> 32:40.293
This is for us, brother.

32:40.326 --> 32:41.861
Uh...

32:41.895 --> 32:43.530
We got a little surprise
in store for you.

32:43.563 --> 32:44.631
I hope you're ready.

32:44.664 --> 32:46.332
If flying in a helicopter
is gonna make me

32:46.366 --> 32:48.935
a $600,000 commission...

32:48.968 --> 32:50.904
(Ryan)
Are you sure we fit in here?

32:50.937 --> 32:51.905
Then let's go.

32:51.938 --> 32:53.573

33:11.658 --> 33:12.892
[tires screeching]

33:12.926 --> 33:15.095
So this is the deal
that we got going on today.

33:15.128 --> 33:16.663
I really like the apartment.

33:16.696 --> 33:19.499
If you win, I buy.

33:19.532 --> 33:21.134
If I win, I fly.

33:21.167 --> 33:22.135
Are you [bleep] me?

33:22.168 --> 33:23.703
I'm not [bleep] you.
Deal?

33:25.105 --> 33:26.773
I would ordinarily say
that this situation

33:26.806 --> 33:30.677
is completely ridiculous,
but, I mean, this is Arty.

33:30.710 --> 33:33.079
Arty drinks tequila
for breakfast, so...

33:33.079 --> 33:34.681
So there's $20 million
riding on it?

33:34.714 --> 33:35.915
- Correct.
- Yeah.

33:35.949 --> 33:37.851
Let's shake on it.
Let's have a good race.

I don't drive.

33:44.958 --> 33:46.226
I have a driver.

33:46.259 --> 33:47.427
If the yellow's waving,
that means

33:47.460 --> 33:48.528
you need to really slow down.

33:48.561 --> 33:49.996
Red means stop.

33:50.096 --> 33:51.097
We got fire suits.

33:52.198 --> 33:53.767
Is there, like--
are there ambulances on staff?

33:53.800 --> 33:56.436

- We'll see.

Why so warm?

Oh, my God, please,
not right now.

34:42.449 --> 34:43.983
I'm selling a building.

34:44.084 --> 34:46.786
- There's not even electricity.
- [exhales]

34:46.820 --> 34:48.455
Oh, my God,
the cupcakes are melting.

34:48.488 --> 34:50.590
Fredrik, look,
here's your fur.

34:50.623 --> 34:51.858
As per requested.

34:51.891 --> 34:54.494
We kept the floors for Ryan.

34:54.527 --> 34:56.429
Um, just a small detail.

34:56.463 --> 34:57.430
Yes?

34:57.464 --> 34:58.531
No more Ryan.

34:58.565 --> 34:59.666
No more Ryan?

34:59.699 --> 35:01.468
He melted away.

35:01.501 --> 35:03.803
I was really hurt by
the accusation that Ryan made

35:03.837 --> 35:04.838
when I told him
that the co-listing

35:04.871 --> 35:06.106
wasn't gonna work out.

35:06.139 --> 35:08.108
So is this because you already
have offers and--

35:08.141 --> 35:09.109
just so that I know

35:09.142 --> 35:10.210
- going forward...
- No.

35:10.243 --> 35:11.211
That there's already money
on the table?

35:11.244 --> 35:12.846
- No.
- Sure.

35:12.879 --> 35:16.383
But despite our disagreement,
I am gonna get some offers

35:16.416 --> 35:17.717
on this place--
I'm convinced.

35:17.751 --> 35:19.686
Even if I have to,
as we say in Swedish...

35:23.189 --> 35:25.191
So you took all my advice,
I can see--that's good.

35:25.225 --> 35:26.960
It's very, like, bachelor fur.

35:27.060 --> 35:28.628
Very sleek.
Beautiful.

35:28.661 --> 35:31.064
Looks good.

35:31.097 --> 35:33.466
I've staged
a $6-million penthouse,

35:33.500 --> 35:36.536
and it is perfection.

35:36.569 --> 35:39.305
Well, with one exception.

35:39.339 --> 35:40.640
Ryan's floors.

35:40.674 --> 35:42.742
Definitely want, like,
dark floors.

35:42.776 --> 35:44.377
(Ryan)
I really like the light floors.

35:44.411 --> 35:46.880
But I also know that not
everyone who's coming today

35:46.913 --> 35:49.382
will be able to afford
a $6-million penthouse.

35:49.416 --> 35:50.617
So I'm gonna also show them

35:50.650 --> 35:52.952
the lower floor
one-bedroom apartment.

35:54.220 --> 35:56.389
Welcome to 138 West 19th.

35:56.423 --> 35:57.757
- Hi, how are you?
- Good to see you.

35:57.791 --> 35:59.259
Oh, no kisses.
I'm, ugh, sweaty.

35:59.292 --> 36:00.660
(Fredrik)
It's a little warm in here.

36:00.694 --> 36:02.228
The AC isn't turned on yet.

36:02.262 --> 36:04.531
It's a brand-new building.

36:04.564 --> 36:07.300
So this is five units,
floor-throughs.

36:07.334 --> 36:08.401
The garden,

36:08.435 --> 36:09.769
the second floor,
the third floor,

36:09.803 --> 36:12.172
the fourth floor,
and then this.

36:12.205 --> 36:15.241
The $6-million cupcake on top.

36:16.676 --> 36:19.346
This is a 2 bedroom,
2 1/2 bath.

36:19.379 --> 36:20.480
Isn't it nice?
It's just a little hot.

36:24.484 --> 36:26.052
The AC is over-built.

36:26.086 --> 36:28.621
It's gonna be so cool in here.

36:28.655 --> 36:32.525
(Fredrik voice-over)
You know, I'm trying to talk
to people.

36:32.559 --> 36:36.096
And all I can see
is a dripping sweat.

36:36.129 --> 36:38.431
I mean, some of these guys are,
like, soaking.

36:38.465 --> 36:40.467
Guys, where are you going?
Wait. Guys?

36:42.736 --> 36:44.404
I feel like my hopes
and my dreams

36:44.437 --> 36:49.209
of selling this so quickly
are kind of melting away.

36:49.242 --> 36:51.811
Like my sweat
as people are walking out.

36:51.845 --> 36:53.947
(Fredrik)
Who wants to go and see
the other floors?

36:53.980 --> 36:55.482
[electronic music]

36:55.515 --> 36:57.250
So this is the fourth floor.

36:57.283 --> 36:59.853
All this glass, and it's, like,
incredible light.

36:59.886 --> 37:01.855
What's the pricing
on square footage of this unit?

37:01.888 --> 37:03.256
It's 1,200 square feet,

37:03.289 --> 37:05.025
and we're asking 1.7.

37:05.025 --> 37:07.027
And where can you find anything
in Manhattan any more

37:07.060 --> 37:09.629
this hot--
I mean, below 2 million?

37:09.662 --> 37:11.097
[laughter]

37:14.034 --> 37:15.769
I'm gonna start taking
my clothes off

37:15.802 --> 37:17.504
because I can't take it
anymore.

37:17.537 --> 37:18.538
- Oh!
- Oh!

37:23.243 --> 37:27.781
A little bit of tanned Swedish
man skin has never hurt anyone.

37:27.814 --> 37:29.649
Right?

37:29.683 --> 37:31.851
I think in this case,
it might actually help.

37:32.919 --> 37:34.187
(Fredrik)
So what do you think?

37:34.220 --> 37:35.188
You know, it's
a pretty vibrant neighborhood,

37:35.221 --> 37:37.590
which is why
we initially liked it.

37:37.624 --> 37:40.226
I think we might be interested
in the third floor.

37:40.260 --> 37:41.227
Okay.

37:41.261 --> 37:42.929
Are you ready to put in
an offer?

37:42.962 --> 37:44.064
- Yeah.
- She says yes.

37:44.064 --> 37:45.298
- I mean...
- I got to think about it.

37:45.331 --> 37:47.400
My head's a little sweaty
from being so hot.

37:47.434 --> 37:49.302
I've had a lot of bad things
happen to me

37:49.336 --> 37:50.637
during open houses,

37:50.670 --> 37:52.539
but I got to say, this is
probably one of the worst.

37:52.572 --> 37:54.140
So what do you think?

37:54.174 --> 37:56.743
Uh, I love it,
but it's way too hot, Fredrik.

37:56.776 --> 37:58.411
I'm gonna have to go.

37:58.445 --> 38:00.814
But when people are interested,
they are interested.

38:02.415 --> 38:04.050
It's like when it's raining,
people that are out looking

38:04.084 --> 38:06.386
during the rainy days,
they're serious.

38:07.554 --> 38:10.890
This is over 1,000 square feet
of private roof.

38:10.924 --> 38:13.426
We have to admit,
6 million is a good price.

38:13.460 --> 38:15.028
I want you to call
all your buyers.

38:15.028 --> 38:16.663
Take some photos now
if you want to.

38:16.696 --> 38:17.697
Any questions?

38:20.633 --> 38:22.669
Today was a hot mess,
but I'm hoping,

38:22.702 --> 38:25.171
as people come home,
in the cold AC environment,

38:25.205 --> 38:26.373
they're gonna be able
to think clearly.

38:26.406 --> 38:28.041
And they're gonna realize,

38:28.041 --> 38:29.909
138 West 19th is a good buy.

38:29.943 --> 38:31.311
You could just open it
a little bit, like--

38:31.344 --> 38:33.046
- Okay.
- It really helps.

38:33.046 --> 38:35.281
I mean, I wouldn't do it
if I really didn't need to.

38:35.315 --> 38:36.883
I feel like a Chippendale.

38:36.916 --> 38:39.552
[laughter]

38:39.586 --> 38:41.254
[engines rev]

38:41.287 --> 38:42.822
Ready?
Go!

38:42.856 --> 38:43.823
[engines revs]

38:43.857 --> 38:46.559
Oh, [bleep]!

38:46.593 --> 38:51.331
It's ten laps,
and my goal is to win.

38:51.364 --> 38:53.433
My other goal is to not die.

38:56.670 --> 38:57.671
Get him. Get him!
Go for it.

38:57.704 --> 39:00.040
A little more gas.

39:00.073 --> 39:01.408
There you go, nice and smooth
with that gas pedal.

39:04.277 --> 39:06.012
Not off to a really great start.

39:06.012 --> 39:07.447
A little bit more gas.
A little bit more gas.

39:07.480 --> 39:09.883
I'm about to lose this deal,
and I do not lose deals,

39:09.916 --> 39:11.551
so it is now or never.

39:11.584 --> 39:15.355
[upbeat music]

39:15.388 --> 39:18.258
- We got this. We got this.
- Arty's got nothing.

39:18.291 --> 39:23.930
* *

39:31.071 --> 39:32.138
Back in, back in.

39:33.440 --> 39:35.041
This is the last lap.

39:35.075 --> 39:37.243
One more lap.

39:37.277 --> 39:39.512
Yeah, let's go, man.
Go! Go! Go!

39:39.546 --> 39:41.514
Now it's time to win
the Cold War.

39:41.548 --> 39:43.616
20 million bucks,
here I come, baby!

39:47.687 --> 39:49.956
(Ryan)
In your face, Arty!

39:50.056 --> 39:51.925
[laughs]

39:51.958 --> 39:53.560
Whoo!

39:53.593 --> 39:57.063
[laughs]

39:57.063 --> 39:58.198
[laughs]

39:58.231 --> 40:03.503
$571,800, bitches.

40:03.536 --> 40:06.206
Oh, in your face!
Oh, yes!

40:06.239 --> 40:08.641
- You got it.
- [laughs]

40:08.675 --> 40:10.076
(Ryan)
You want to do the deal?
Do you want to do it?

40:10.110 --> 40:11.077
(Arty)
Let's do it.
Let's do it.

40:11.111 --> 40:12.545
- Whoo!
- [laughs]

40:13.880 --> 40:15.015
Whole 49th floor.

40:15.048 --> 40:16.549
Craziest views
in the city, man.

40:16.583 --> 40:18.852
- Those are yours.
- Let's do it.

40:22.122 --> 40:23.289
Off the market?

40:23.323 --> 40:24.657
The penthouse is gonna sell now.
We can't--

40:24.691 --> 40:25.759
No, no, no.

40:33.199 --> 40:35.969
[funky music]

40:36.002 --> 40:37.771
* *

40:37.804 --> 40:38.838
[phone line rings]

40:39.873 --> 40:42.976
- Erez, it's Fredrik...
- Hey.

40:43.009 --> 40:44.844
Your favorite broker.

40:44.878 --> 40:47.447
So I'm hoping
that you're sitting down.

40:47.480 --> 40:48.982
I have very good news.

40:49.015 --> 40:50.250
My listing
at 138 West 19th Street

40:50.283 --> 40:52.318
has been hot, hot, hot.

40:52.352 --> 40:55.822
I mean, first the open house was
hotter than hell, unfortunately,

40:55.855 --> 40:56.823
but then...

40:56.856 --> 40:59.159
Full ask!

40:59.192 --> 41:00.894
The deals started coming in.

41:00.927 --> 41:02.829
Hotter and hotter and hotter.

41:02.862 --> 41:05.165
So, you know,
I had an open house.

41:05.198 --> 41:06.466
It was very warm,
no AC,

41:06.499 --> 41:09.402
but I sold
four out of five units.

41:09.436 --> 41:13.239
Garden, two, three, and four,
all sold.

41:13.273 --> 41:15.075
All the one-bedrooms,
all done.

41:15.075 --> 41:17.243
Full ask.
No concessions.

41:17.277 --> 41:18.678
Done, done, done, done.

41:25.485 --> 41:26.453
No, no, no.
We're gonna get--

41:26.486 --> 41:27.620
We're gonna sell the penthouse.

41:27.654 --> 41:28.722
But the penthouse, we knew,
was expensive.

41:28.755 --> 41:30.290
It was a big price point.

41:30.323 --> 41:32.125
Um, that's why
I staged that one.

41:32.158 --> 41:33.159
And, um--

41:39.199 --> 41:40.967
Off the market?

41:48.541 --> 41:50.410
No, no, no, no,
it's hot because I made it hot.

41:50.443 --> 41:51.878
It was so hot, I was sweating.

41:51.911 --> 41:53.279
I had to take my clothes off.

41:53.313 --> 41:55.015
It was so--
it's hot because--

41:55.115 --> 41:56.583
the penthouse is gonna sell now.

41:56.616 --> 41:57.684
We can't--
No, no, no.

42:07.193 --> 42:09.696
[line beeps]

42:09.729 --> 42:10.964
I sell out every building.

42:11.064 --> 42:13.833
I sell out every
single building, every unit.

42:13.867 --> 42:16.903
My job is not done
until I'm sold out.

42:16.936 --> 42:18.838
And I'm not gonna care
about the units already sold.

42:18.872 --> 42:21.741
That's great.
Fine. Amazing.

42:21.775 --> 42:24.377
I am gonna think, day and night,
on the penthouse

42:24.411 --> 42:25.512
that I still haven't sold.

42:25.545 --> 42:27.080
Stop the car.

42:27.113 --> 42:29.315
Just stop right here.

42:29.349 --> 42:30.450

Come on. Come on!

42:38.658 --> 42:43.096
This is probably the most
important meeting of my career,

42:43.096 --> 42:45.432
and I am [bleep]
going to miss it.

42:45.465 --> 42:48.902
Where are we exactly
with the approved finishes?

42:48.935 --> 42:50.170
We don't have approved finishes?

42:53.506 --> 42:55.875
It radiates heat, so no one
will ever have cold feet.

42:55.909 --> 42:57.911
Speaking of cold feet,
when's the wedding?

42:57.944 --> 43:00.180
What would be the coolest way
