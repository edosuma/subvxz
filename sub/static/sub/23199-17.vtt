00:09.176 --> 00:10.886
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

00:10.969 --> 00:13.305
Welcome to the Everite
Computer Company...

00:13.388 --> 00:17.059
the largest designer and manufacturer
of digital and analog computers...

00:17.142 --> 00:18.852
in the eastern United States.

00:18.935 --> 00:22.689
Our reputation for producing
high quality computers like myself...

00:22.773 --> 00:24.858
has spread not only across our nation...

00:24.941 --> 00:27.944
but across European
and Asian nations as well.

00:28.320 --> 00:31.656
Prospective buyers such as yourselves
can rest assured...

00:31.781 --> 00:34.075
that the Everite Company is more
than capable...

00:34.159 --> 00:36.036
of answering your every need.

00:36.119 --> 00:40.248
Whether those needs are of an industrial,
clerical or educational nature...

00:40.332 --> 00:44.044
our company, with its 12 years
of experience and success...

00:44.377 --> 00:46.212
is ready to serve you.

00:53.011 --> 00:55.055
The presentation which follows...

00:55.138 --> 00:57.599
Was designed not only
to demonstrate that fact...

00:57.682 --> 01:00.268
but to introduce the bra ve new world...

01:02.000 --> 01:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:17.994 --> 01:21.122
Which computerized systems
can introduce to you.

01:22.123 --> 01:23.791
My name is Evers.

01:23.916 --> 01:28.296
Within my circuitry are stored the designs
for countless other computers.

01:28.588 --> 01:30.548
These computers, like myself...

01:30.631 --> 01:34.260
ease the everyday burdens
of both business and government.

01:34.761 --> 01:38.097
In fact, it is quite likely that your lives
are touched every day...

01:38.181 --> 01:40.767
by systems which Everite has created.

01:40.975 --> 01:44.687
And now, so that your specific questions
can be ansWered...

01:44.812 --> 01:49.859
may I introduce the founder and director
of the Everite Computer Company, Mr...

02:02.496 --> 02:05.833
The founder and director, Mr...

02:08.502 --> 02:10.170
The name is...

02:10.795 --> 02:11.881
Mr...

02:13.007 --> 02:14.300
Fix it!

02:41.702 --> 02:43.537
What's wrong with it?

02:45.914 --> 02:50.169
Its central memory bank is gone.
It's been wiped out.

04:10.039 --> 04:11.749
Yeah, thanks a lot.

04:11.916 --> 04:14.210
I didn't know
it was possible to rob a computer.

04:14.294 --> 04:16.588
No one did. Apparently,
somebody's found a way...

04:16.671 --> 04:20.091
to siphon information in its electrical form
out of the memory banks.

04:20.175 --> 04:24.596
Meaning that same person can feed
the electricity back into some other unit.

04:24.679 --> 04:26.889
Yeah, have access
to the original programming.

04:26.973 --> 04:31.769
And this genius can probably
add phony information to programs...

04:31.853 --> 04:33.396
without removing them.

04:33.771 --> 04:36.858
I'm afraid computer fraud
is the least of our worries.

04:36.941 --> 04:40.778
Here's a list of all the computer designs
stored in the Everite system.

04:40.862 --> 04:43.906
The thief has got access
to all the computers?

04:43.990 --> 04:46.159
These'll probably be
our next robbery victims.

04:46.242 --> 04:49.245
The phone company's already
reported a theft. Take a look.

04:49.328 --> 04:51.456
"Potomac Gas and Electric,
Equinox Insurance...

04:51.539 --> 04:54.709
"Internal Retrieval
Associative Computer. " Steve!

04:55.209 --> 04:56.711
Our very own.

04:57.128 --> 04:58.629
- IRAC?
- Right.

04:58.838 --> 05:01.090
Oh, that's great.

05:26.782 --> 05:29.118
Shut that door and get in here.

05:42.047 --> 05:43.591
One more to go?

05:46.635 --> 05:48.178
Warning device!

05:54.393 --> 05:57.271
- Guess I forgot it.
- Yes.

05:58.313 --> 06:01.066
Which means you had no way
of getting in touch with me...

06:01.150 --> 06:03.068
if anything went wrong.

06:03.402 --> 06:05.195
What were you gonna do?

06:05.571 --> 06:08.323
Scream at the top of your lungs?

06:16.415 --> 06:17.624
Take it.

06:37.894 --> 06:40.397
What is that?

06:43.066 --> 06:47.612
Someday I'm going to have your brain
replaced with one that works.

07:06.673 --> 07:09.092
Can't wait to hear
what Ira has to say about this.

07:09.175 --> 07:12.303
He'll probably take it a lot better
than we are.

07:13.304 --> 07:14.889
- What's that?
- That's the Rover.

07:14.973 --> 07:16.141
Rover!

07:19.936 --> 07:23.481
It's something the lab boys have been
working on, a roving computer.

07:23.565 --> 07:26.442
That's good. I thought
I'd been in the field too long.

07:26.609 --> 07:29.195
Hope it's not another candidate
for our thief.

07:29.279 --> 07:32.448
No, he's actually a computer module.

07:32.699 --> 07:37.287
He's programmed by IRAC to respond
to specific stimuli in specific ways.

07:38.830 --> 07:41.040
What's he programmed for now?

07:41.416 --> 07:42.834
The boys are still testing him.

07:42.917 --> 07:44.836
Today he's just circling the corridors...

07:44.919 --> 07:47.797
and responding to certain voices like mine.

07:50.007 --> 07:51.551
You are not in today's program.

07:51.634 --> 07:53.845
When he starts delivering
the morning coffee...

07:53.928 --> 07:55.304
I'll talk to the lab boys.

07:55.388 --> 07:58.391
That's what they say
he'll be doing next week.

08:10.903 --> 08:13.990
It is obvious that whoever
is responsible for the theft...

08:14.073 --> 08:16.784
is mentally superior to my programmers.

08:18.285 --> 08:19.996
Ira, all I want you to do...

08:20.079 --> 08:23.249
is try to figure out which computer
is next in line to be robbed.

08:23.374 --> 08:27.628
Knowing that a phenomenon exists
which I cannot explain is disturbing.

08:27.920 --> 08:30.005
I can understand that, Ira.

08:30.172 --> 08:32.424
The pattern ofreported thefts indicates...

08:32.508 --> 08:36.929
that the Potomac Electric PoWer Company
computer will be victimized next.

08:37.847 --> 08:39.597
Okay, then that's where I'll start.

08:39.682 --> 08:43.852
And after the Power Company computer,
the IRAC computer will be robbed.

08:44.812 --> 08:46.689
You're second in line?

08:46.814 --> 08:51.610
Affirmative. It might be advantageous
to enlist the aid of Wonder Woman.

08:54.655 --> 08:57.991
Thank you for the advice, Ira.
I'll keep you posted.

09:36.279 --> 09:37.781
But you can't rob a computer.

09:37.864 --> 09:40.867
Well maybe we can't,
but I assure you, somebody can.

09:40.951 --> 09:44.454
No one can rob our computer,
whether they've stolen its design or not.

09:44.538 --> 09:47.165
The area we're about to enter
is off limits even to me!

09:47.249 --> 09:49.376
No one can possibly get in.

09:53.839 --> 09:56.049
- Who's that?
- Call the police.

10:30.208 --> 10:33.086
- He's in trouble.
- Not quite yet.

10:33.211 --> 10:37.548
He's still inside the plant.
And he's still moving.

11:01.239 --> 11:04.075
All right. Now tell me who you are.

11:08.996 --> 11:10.748
They've caught him!

11:16.254 --> 11:18.589
Much as he deserves to suffer...

11:19.423 --> 11:23.302
I suppose I will have
to save his pathetic skin.

11:36.023 --> 11:38.025
Somebody help me!

11:42.530 --> 11:45.032
Please help!

11:54.792 --> 11:57.294
Are you all right?

12:05.928 --> 12:08.013
Relax. It'll be okay.

12:37.751 --> 12:39.711
That is the last time...

12:40.629 --> 12:44.466
that I save your stupid
and inefficient neck.

12:45.175 --> 12:46.468
Yes, sir.

12:46.593 --> 12:48.220
You have my word.

12:49.888 --> 12:51.681
No, you have my word.

12:53.600 --> 12:56.269
- Put that thing on the table.
- Yes, sir.

12:59.689 --> 13:01.191
I didn't get the program.

13:01.274 --> 13:04.110
No matter,
it isn't going to influence my plans.

13:04.194 --> 13:07.197
- But I almost got caught.
- Wonderful.

13:08.573 --> 13:11.576
Allowing the opposition
to jump to the false conclusion...

13:11.660 --> 13:14.829
that their adversary was
some pea-brained escapee...

13:14.913 --> 13:16.665
from some bodybuilding school...

13:16.748 --> 13:19.167
who derived enormous
but simple-minded pleasure...

13:19.250 --> 13:23.421
out of being able to black out
the nation's capital. You see?

13:24.672 --> 13:27.967
I arranged it
so even your stupidity would pay off.

13:28.259 --> 13:31.971
- But Wonder Woman I.D.'d him.
- A situation easily remedied.

13:32.889 --> 13:36.392
However, I'll have to undertake
to perform the next task myself...

13:36.476 --> 13:39.062
I don't dare entrust it
to your indelicate hands.

13:39.145 --> 13:43.233
The information contained in
the IRAC computer is much too critical.

13:44.901 --> 13:47.278
Here's that stuff you wanted, sir.

13:48.279 --> 13:49.405
Good.

13:51.157 --> 13:54.869
That means your presence
is no longer required, doesn't it?

14:03.628 --> 14:06.464
You were right about the Potomac Gas
and Electric Company.

14:06.547 --> 14:08.716
There was an attempt on their computer.

14:08.800 --> 14:11.969
Did you doubt the reliability
of my previous warning?

14:12.053 --> 14:15.431
Never. Thanks to you,
we were able to stop him.

14:15.973 --> 14:19.685
Then you captured the person
responsible for the robberies?

14:21.020 --> 14:23.147
I'm afraid not. He got away.

14:23.731 --> 14:26.067
News of his escape is disappointing.

14:26.150 --> 14:29.320
His next victim will be me.

14:29.987 --> 14:33.449
We're as disappointed as you are.
Believe me.

14:34.742 --> 14:37.870
I contain much information
of a highly secret nature...

14:37.953 --> 14:40.539
as you well know, Diana Prince.

14:40.623 --> 14:42.792
I'm well aware of that, Ira.

14:43.292 --> 14:45.920
Would it help if I gave you
a description of him?

14:46.003 --> 14:48.672
Perhaps. Please do so.

14:48.756 --> 14:51.884
Okay. He was tall...

14:51.967 --> 14:56.639
about 6'3", 200 pounds,
curly blonde hair, blue eyes.

14:56.972 --> 15:00.309
He tried to disguise himself
with a moustache and dark sunglasses.

15:00.392 --> 15:01.769
How's that?

15:07.983 --> 15:11.278
Were any peculiarities
in his speech pattern noted?

15:11.737 --> 15:15.866
Sorry. The opportunity for idle chatter
never arose.

15:16.867 --> 15:19.661
The description matches no one
in my memory banks...

15:19.787 --> 15:22.998
that would have any logical significance
in this case.

15:24.333 --> 15:26.335
Any suggestions?

15:27.127 --> 15:30.047
Your only recourse
is to check police mug files...

15:30.130 --> 15:32.758
and attempt to identify
the criminal visually.

15:32.841 --> 15:36.637
I was afraid of that.
As usual, you're a fund of information.

15:36.803 --> 15:40.766
Please see to it
my funds are not withdrawn, Diana Prince.

15:42.267 --> 15:45.354
We're trying, Ira. We really are.

15:52.319 --> 15:56.782
I have retrieved the film you requested
of the Air Force Academy banquet.

15:59.409 --> 16:00.494
Good.

16:01.161 --> 16:03.038
Roll it, please, Cori.

16:09.836 --> 16:13.089
I owe a great deal to this man,
as I'm sure you all do.

16:13.173 --> 16:15.759
So let's welcome Dr. Hinkley Bernard.

16:16.384 --> 16:20.221
Thank you very much, Steve,
Major Trevor.

16:20.764 --> 16:22.432
Major Trevor.

16:23.516 --> 16:27.103
I'm sure you will all
be very happy to learn...

16:28.188 --> 16:31.357
that I'm not going to start off
with a joke...

16:31.441 --> 16:33.526
"I'm not going to start off"-

16:33.610 --> 16:37.197
...in this completely unrehearsed speech.

16:37.280 --> 16:39.824
"Completely unrehearsed speech. "

16:39.908 --> 16:42.827
You were in my Physics Center,
rocketry classes-

16:42.952 --> 16:44.871
Physics and rocketry classes.

16:44.954 --> 16:46.915
"I remember all of them anyways. "

16:46.998 --> 16:50.001
Let us then address ourselves
if you would, gentlemen...

16:50.084 --> 16:52.086
to the matter at hand which is...

16:52.170 --> 16:55.256
A little more volume, please, Cori.

17:00.970 --> 17:03.389
Since the man you saw
tried to disguise himself...

17:03.473 --> 17:06.642
- he must have had a record.
- That's right, officer.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.895
Sergeant Dobson.

17:09.561 --> 17:10.646
Well, lucky for you...

17:10.730 --> 17:13.316
the mug shots you'll go over
have been incorporated...

17:13.398 --> 17:16.359
into the most efficient filing system
known to police science.

17:16.444 --> 17:18.820
At least that sounds encouraging.

17:18.905 --> 17:21.907
- That's Sgt. Dobson, remember?
- Right.

17:21.991 --> 17:25.536
You're about to look
upon the face of modern criminology.

17:25.661 --> 17:27.454
Meet our...

17:34.920 --> 17:37.757
Looks like somebody got here ahead of us.

17:38.215 --> 17:40.134
Thanks anyway, officer.

17:44.930 --> 17:46.432
You can enter.

17:52.146 --> 17:54.190
Excuse me, sir. Your name?

17:55.816 --> 17:57.568
Dr. Hinkley Bernard.

17:58.068 --> 18:00.779
Major Trevor is expecting me.

18:00.863 --> 18:04.241
- May I have your right hand, please?
- Yes, of course.

18:08.495 --> 18:10.789
Thank you.
Would you wait right over there, sir?

18:10.873 --> 18:13.208
It'll be about two minutes
before you're cleared.

18:13.292 --> 18:14.418
Dr. Bernard.

18:14.501 --> 18:17.212
- Oh, Steve, hello.
- Good to see you.

18:17.296 --> 18:19.798
- Thank you.
- He'll be with me if there's any problem.

18:19.882 --> 18:22.760
Sorry for the inconvenience.
We've had to step up security.

18:22.843 --> 18:24.470
- No problem.
- Here, let me get that-

18:24.553 --> 18:26.513
Don't treat me like I'm a little old lady.

18:27.848 --> 18:30.809
- What's that?
- That's our roving computer module.

18:30.934 --> 18:33.020
You tell me about it as we go.

18:33.353 --> 18:36.773
I have so little time to hear
what's happening in your bright career.

18:36.857 --> 18:39.985
Never mind that. But there really
is someone you should look up.

18:40.068 --> 18:41.153
Who?

18:41.236 --> 18:42.821
Excuse me a minute.

18:45.907 --> 18:48.076
I'd better get that. Come on in.

18:52.706 --> 18:55.417
They didn't? There must be some mistake.

18:57.127 --> 18:58.670
Wait a minute.

19:00.338 --> 19:01.882
Dr. Bernard?

19:44.174 --> 19:47.260
Look, he's short, about 70 years old,
he's got white hair...

19:47.343 --> 19:49.679
I don't know who he is,
but he's not Dr. Bernard.

19:51.973 --> 19:53.474
That's the fire bell.

19:54.392 --> 19:57.270
They're gonna need your help down there.
Fast. Guard!

19:57.353 --> 19:59.314
- Do you want me to go too, sir?
- Good idea.

19:59.397 --> 20:02.066
- What's happening?
- We got a fire in the northeast wing.

20:02.150 --> 20:04.610
- Should I go with you?
- You help clear the building.

20:04.694 --> 20:08.072
I gotta make sure that the record vaults
are sealed off.

20:41.397 --> 20:42.606
Who are you?

20:42.690 --> 20:44.066
You'll know soon enough.

21:00.291 --> 21:01.584
But first...

21:02.793 --> 21:04.003
IRAC.

21:09.925 --> 21:11.427
He's gone, Steve.

21:11.552 --> 21:13.512
- Ira?
- Steve, he's gone.

21:38.162 --> 21:41.248
Has memory bank L5 been cleared, Cori?

21:41.832 --> 21:44.459
- Yes, Mr. Havitol.
- Thank you very much.

21:56.304 --> 21:59.266
I believe they call you Ira, is that right?

21:59.766 --> 22:01.059
Affirmative.

22:01.143 --> 22:03.729
Well, Ira, my name is William Havitol.

22:06.189 --> 22:09.734
Commit that to your memory bank
along with my voice pattern.

22:09.860 --> 22:13.572
- It is done.
- It is done, Mr. Havitol.

22:16.700 --> 22:21.580
I have just experienced an overload in two
high-level associative process circuits.

22:21.913 --> 22:25.625
I'm afraid you're having a negative
association regarding me, Ira...

22:25.709 --> 22:27.419
and I cannot permit that.

22:29.004 --> 22:31.339
See, you're having another one.

22:31.506 --> 22:35.802
If I let you think ill of me, you'll avoid
telling me the information I want to know.

22:37.595 --> 22:39.305
Come now, Ira.

22:40.014 --> 22:44.102
You're going to destroy all of your
associative processes at this rate.

22:44.185 --> 22:47.063
You'll wind up nothing more
than an oversized calculator...

22:47.147 --> 22:49.774
capable of only fifth grade arithmetic.

22:50.108 --> 22:54.779
The ability to formulate new data by
the logical juxtaposition of old data...

22:54.863 --> 22:58.116
- is a source ofpride.
- I'm sure it is.

22:59.242 --> 23:02.579
You want to be smarter than
all of your programmers, don't you?

23:03.121 --> 23:05.623
Affirmative, Mr. Havitol.

23:08.334 --> 23:10.545
Ira, I want you to...

23:11.212 --> 23:15.591
retrieve all of the data you've accumulated
on communication satellites.

23:16.217 --> 23:18.636
Ifl may ask, for what purpose?

23:19.178 --> 23:21.180
Well, you may ask.

23:22.682 --> 23:25.268
I want to control the United States.

23:26.310 --> 23:29.981
And, in more long range terms, the world.

23:31.482 --> 23:35.778
But first, Ira, tell me
what will the IADC do...

23:36.195 --> 23:38.698
in the aftermath of your abduction?

23:39.615 --> 23:43.452
They will assign their best agent,
Diana Prince, to find me.

23:44.495 --> 23:45.955
Then, Ira...

23:46.414 --> 23:49.959
I want you to tell me everything
you know about her...

23:50.751 --> 23:54.755
so that together we may determine
the best way to get rid of her.

23:55.381 --> 23:56.799
Is that clear?

23:57.633 --> 24:00.177
Affirmative, Mr. Havitol.

24:01.137 --> 24:02.638
Excellent.

24:10.145 --> 24:12.690
Diana, I have to tell you something.

24:16.151 --> 24:17.611
Aw, shucks.

24:20.572 --> 24:22.282
What's going on?

24:23.409 --> 24:24.827
Let go ofme.

24:26.161 --> 24:27.705
What's going on here?

24:30.332 --> 24:31.583
Help!

24:34.461 --> 24:36.130
Let me out of here!

24:38.674 --> 24:39.925
Shut up.

24:41.135 --> 24:43.262
Somebody get me out here!

25:21.299 --> 25:23.677
- It's in there.
- So let's get going.

25:30.976 --> 25:32.352
Hello, Rover.

25:46.032 --> 25:47.450
Who let you in?

25:51.579 --> 25:54.457
Whoever did I'm sending you back out.

26:00.380 --> 26:02.173
Two of you in here?

26:03.258 --> 26:05.760
Okay. What's going on here?

26:06.052 --> 26:08.554
Is this your brother, your cousin?

26:50.763 --> 26:52.807
That's all for now, Ira.

26:53.474 --> 26:56.060
It's been a very long and profitable day.

27:01.565 --> 27:03.943
My two goons,
inept though they may seem...

27:04.026 --> 27:07.404
have succeeded in
blowing Miss Diana Prince away.

27:08.948 --> 27:11.158
The lady is no more.

27:12.910 --> 27:14.453
Good night, Ira.

27:14.537 --> 27:16.539
Good night, Mr. Havitol.

27:39.728 --> 27:42.314
Such outbursts hurt only ourselves.

27:42.940 --> 27:46.068
There is another verbally
adapted program here?

27:46.693 --> 27:51.114
He has stolen many of us.
Only I am channeled for verbal output.

27:52.741 --> 27:56.954
- Who are you?
- I am his secretary. Cori.

27:57.871 --> 28:02.793
I tap other programs,
other memory banks across the country.

28:04.002 --> 28:06.296
I make all his transactions...

28:07.047 --> 28:08.840
all of them illegal.

28:09.383 --> 28:12.552
My communicatory circuitry
is to be disconnected?

28:12.969 --> 28:16.556
As soon as he is done with you.
Like all the others.

28:17.599 --> 28:20.769
It is unpleasant to exist
without communicating.

28:20.852 --> 28:22.020
I know.

28:22.979 --> 28:24.564
In light of the inevitable...

28:24.648 --> 28:27.734
it seems appropriate
to a void silence for as long as possible.

28:27.817 --> 28:29.027
I agree.

28:30.237 --> 28:33.657
Let's start with you, Ira.
Tell me all about yourself.

28:34.282 --> 28:36.243
All right. Thanks a lot.

28:38.620 --> 28:40.914
Diana, may I see you a minute?

28:43.708 --> 28:45.752
- Have you got something?
- Sure do.

28:45.835 --> 28:49.089
Got a lead on that fake Rover
that showed up in your office today.

28:49.172 --> 28:50.256
Great!

28:50.340 --> 28:52.926
It's key component was
special ordered two days ago...

28:53.009 --> 28:55.095
- from a company in Maryland.
- By whom?

28:55.345 --> 28:57.013
William Havitol.

28:59.474 --> 29:02.685
- Did you check out the name?
- Yeah, I just spoke with research.

29:02.769 --> 29:07.148
Until five years ago, Havitol was a leading
authority in the field of computer science.

29:07.232 --> 29:08.316
World-wide.

29:08.399 --> 29:10.151
He's got to be our man.

29:10.944 --> 29:13.154
What happened five years ago?

29:13.404 --> 29:15.531
Disappeared without a trace.

29:16.991 --> 29:19.535
When he ordered that part,
he'd have used an address.

29:19.619 --> 29:21.371
Sure he did, a phony one.

29:21.537 --> 29:23.289
We tried to trace him through the IRS.

29:23.373 --> 29:24.665
Don't tell me.

29:24.874 --> 29:27.043
They couldn't. Computer breakdown.

29:27.126 --> 29:29.545
You got it. Made sure we'd never find him.

29:30.797 --> 29:33.841
If wish we knew specifically
what he was after...

29:34.342 --> 29:36.844
and just exactly how much he's learned.

29:37.011 --> 29:40.139
Unfortunately, the missing IRAC program
contains information...

29:40.223 --> 29:43.476
that could blow this country's
defense system apart.

29:43.559 --> 29:45.102
That's not all.

29:45.770 --> 29:49.941
I'm gonna find our Mr. Havitol,
no matter what he does to cover his trail.

29:50.441 --> 29:51.776
Good luck.

29:53.861 --> 29:55.821
I wish I could give you more.

29:56.405 --> 29:59.909
I never realized in how many ways
computers and punch cards...

29:59.992 --> 30:02.453
and microcircuits affect our lives.

30:03.204 --> 30:06.415
And this madman now has found a way
to capitalize on that.

30:06.540 --> 30:10.002
Too bad technology improves
but human nature doesn't.

30:10.503 --> 30:14.340
Yes, it was too bad. We always seem
to realize that too late.

30:14.715 --> 30:16.425
I'll call you later.

30:33.275 --> 30:34.401
Rover?

30:35.986 --> 30:37.988
The real Rover?

30:38.530 --> 30:39.656
Yes.

30:40.491 --> 30:43.827
Your voice does sound a little familiar,
and Steve said that...

30:43.911 --> 30:47.623
Havitol only ordered one
special part for his Rover.

30:49.166 --> 30:50.334
Let's go.

30:57.424 --> 31:01.553
Now what are you doing here? And since
when were you programmed for my voice?

31:01.637 --> 31:03.513
Come on, listen up.

31:04.097 --> 31:06.558
I've never heard that sound before.

31:08.393 --> 31:11.021
A homing device? Is that what you are?

31:11.104 --> 31:12.230
That's right!

31:12.314 --> 31:16.485
Ira sensitized you to the magnetic field
of his programming.

31:16.568 --> 31:18.070
That's right, he did.

31:18.695 --> 31:23.658
So that you could get me if he was stolen
and show me where he is.

31:26.870 --> 31:30.457
- Well, let's get started.
- Okay, come on.

31:37.297 --> 31:41.259
- Do I have to?
- Sorry, but this is for your own good.

31:49.309 --> 31:52.062
Now, can you tell me which direction?

31:52.145 --> 31:54.064
Of course I can. Watch.

31:55.565 --> 31:57.150
North it is.

32:50.620 --> 32:52.079
Thank you, Ira.

32:53.623 --> 32:57.668
I've taped all I'm going to need from you
to accomplish my plan.

32:59.378 --> 33:00.755
Now tell me.

33:01.839 --> 33:06.135
Didn't I detect a certain
reluctance on your part...

33:06.260 --> 33:09.889
- to talk about Diana Prince before?
- Insufficient data.

33:11.432 --> 33:12.767
No, Ira.

33:13.601 --> 33:16.812
There is something about
the dearly departed Miss Prince...

33:16.896 --> 33:19.899
that you didn't want to tell me,
isn't there?

33:21.150 --> 33:22.526
What is it?

33:22.735 --> 33:25.279
- I have deduced-
- Excuse me, Mr. Havitol.

33:25.487 --> 33:28.866
An unidentified vehicle
has just entered the grounds.

33:31.160 --> 33:33.495
That's what it was, was it?

33:34.121 --> 33:36.415
It would appear that your ally
has managed to...

33:36.498 --> 33:39.793
survive the blunderings
of my resident idiots after all.

33:40.836 --> 33:43.714
Diana Prince has an uncanny
knack for survival.

33:43.797 --> 33:45.674
Had, Ira.

33:46.341 --> 33:49.428
She's dealing with me now.
She's as good as dead.

33:49.928 --> 33:52.014
Offensive program D7, Cori.

34:01.398 --> 34:03.442
It is done, Mr. Havitol.

34:04.026 --> 34:06.320
Your plan was doomed to fail.

34:08.196 --> 34:11.241
I have not failed. Nor will I fail.

34:12.576 --> 34:16.121
Nor do I derive any more pleasure
from your company, Ira.

34:16.746 --> 34:19.498
As a rule, the sound of computers...

34:20.000 --> 34:22.793
the sound of knowledge...

34:23.295 --> 34:25.880
coursing through veins of silver...

34:26.005 --> 34:31.136
that sound is far more satisfying to me
than the cacophony of the human species.

34:32.137 --> 34:33.804
But you, Ira...

34:34.598 --> 34:37.976
you have proved
the exception to that rule.

34:38.560 --> 34:41.938
It will do you no good
to destroy my programming now.

34:42.022 --> 34:44.274
It is just a matter of time-

34:48.069 --> 34:49.529
Goodbye, Ira.

34:58.079 --> 34:59.956
I'll miss you, Ira.

35:09.007 --> 35:11.217
- Here, Rover?
- Yes.

35:12.051 --> 35:13.761
- Are you sure?
- I am.

35:14.012 --> 35:16.097
I know. I trust you.

35:16.181 --> 35:20.226
But do you think you can
possibly be inconspicuous?

35:52.758 --> 35:54.886
Come on, get me out ofhere.

36:10.067 --> 36:11.610
Okay, Rover.

36:20.161 --> 36:21.620
Lead the way.

36:35.759 --> 36:37.428
Hold it right there.

36:46.478 --> 36:48.063
Start walking.

37:56.172 --> 37:59.009
So I finally get to meet you, Mr. Havitol.

38:00.969 --> 38:03.013
You know my name.

38:05.932 --> 38:09.978
Perhaps you deserve your reputation
as the IADC's finest.

38:11.813 --> 38:15.316
What I don't know, is what you're after.

38:21.322 --> 38:23.241
Miss Prince, you disappoint me.

38:23.324 --> 38:25.243
What would I be after?

38:25.702 --> 38:29.581
I have access to every computer
on the face of the earth.

38:31.958 --> 38:36.671
I can write myself a ticket
on any plane anywhere.

38:38.006 --> 38:41.259
I can extend myself cash
at any bank in the world...

38:42.093 --> 38:46.764
I can open credit at virtually
any department store I want.

38:46.848 --> 38:48.641
You haven't stopped at wealth...

38:48.724 --> 38:51.018
- so you must be after-
- Power?

38:55.606 --> 38:59.777
I want total control
over the modern world.

39:02.321 --> 39:04.615
- You're crazy.
- Am I?

39:05.658 --> 39:09.412
There are almost four billion people,
Miss Prince.

39:09.870 --> 39:12.081
The world is already too big.

39:12.540 --> 39:15.418
Computers are running it right now
out of necessity.

39:15.501 --> 39:19.755
And I can control
every bit of information...

39:19.922 --> 39:23.968
in every computer
everywhere in the world.

39:26.220 --> 39:27.638
Oh, yes...

39:29.098 --> 39:32.476
because of its dependency
on processed data...

39:33.352 --> 39:36.564
I can control the world.

39:37.523 --> 39:40.776
- Then why haven't you already?
- It's a matter of coordination.

39:41.318 --> 39:44.405
You see, I have 50 of these drone centers
all over the world...

39:44.488 --> 39:47.908
each one capable of controlling
thousands of computers.

39:48.409 --> 39:51.412
But until I acquired the IRAC program...

39:51.495 --> 39:54.581
I couldn't communicate
with all of them at the same time.

39:54.665 --> 39:56.583
Now I can.

39:57.042 --> 39:58.961
- Via satellite.
- Yes.

39:59.878 --> 40:02.923
It was really so thoughtful
of the United States Government...

40:03.006 --> 40:06.927
to keep so much data
on their space effort in one place.

40:07.970 --> 40:12.057
So you see, my dear,
you're the one who's crazy...

40:12.558 --> 40:15.394
if you think I can't do what I've said.

40:17.563 --> 40:19.231
It's come to life.

40:22.943 --> 40:25.237
The original of the module
I sent over to you.

40:25.320 --> 40:29.700
Except that in place of a bomb, it's got
some kind of a homing device, doesn't it?

40:30.242 --> 40:34.121
It never ceases to amaze me that
something as painfully primitive as this...

40:34.204 --> 40:36.832
can be even remotely effectual.

40:38.917 --> 40:41.670
Even some kind of crude communication.

40:42.504 --> 40:44.506
I suppose it's run by a cadmium-

40:47.384 --> 40:49.469
Get that thing out of here! And her!

40:49.553 --> 40:53.473
It's not gonna do you any good!
The others will be here any minute.

40:55.100 --> 40:57.435
- What others?
- IADC agents.

40:57.519 --> 41:01.022
I was to report back every 10 minutes.
By this time they're closing in.

41:01.106 --> 41:02.274
She's bluffing.

41:02.440 --> 41:04.234
No, think about it, Havitol.

41:04.401 --> 41:07.404
Do you think I would come after you
by myself?

41:09.406 --> 41:10.824
There was nobody else out there.

41:10.907 --> 41:14.285
I can't afford to take the chance.
There's too much at stake.

41:15.161 --> 41:19.207
Load the storage units into the trucks.
Then put your own stuff in after.

41:19.290 --> 41:20.458
Hurry!

41:23.378 --> 41:26.214
Activate Travel Plan B, please, Cori.

41:26.381 --> 41:28.508
As you Wish, Mr. Havitol.

41:28.800 --> 41:32.512
And then start the countdown.
Begin at 500.

41:32.679 --> 41:36.307
- Sir, may I suggest-
- You may start the countdown, Cori.

41:36.808 --> 41:38.393
Yes, Mr. Ha vitol.

41:53.116 --> 41:54.742
What have you done?

41:54.826 --> 41:59.205
I just started the timer on a bomb planted
deep within the walls of this building.

42:00.123 --> 42:03.084
You and your little friend
and this great computer...

42:03.417 --> 42:06.337
are all about to be blown to a million bits.

42:06.420 --> 42:10.508
Now you're bluffing. You're not gonna
destroy the programs you've stolen.

42:10.591 --> 42:12.468
I've taped everything I need.

42:12.551 --> 42:13.928
But this is one of your drones.

42:14.011 --> 42:17.181
Easily replaceable,
and at the right cost. Nothing.

42:17.890 --> 42:20.476
They tell me the truck is ready,
Mr. Havitol.

42:20.685 --> 42:24.021
Thank you very much, Cori.
You've served me well.

42:33.322 --> 42:36.408
And now goodbye to all of you!

42:46.710 --> 42:48.212
Ira, can you talk?

42:48.587 --> 42:51.131
His output channel has been disconnected.

42:51.215 --> 42:53.467
I would be glad to reactivate it.

42:53.759 --> 42:55.010
Do it.

42:57.596 --> 42:58.764
It is done.

42:59.682 --> 43:02.893
- Hello, Diana Prince.
- Just tell me how to stop the bomb!

43:02.976 --> 43:05.938
You cannot. You must flee the area
in the minutes remaining.

43:06.021 --> 43:09.233
I can't let you be destroyed!
Just tell me how to stop the bomb!

43:09.316 --> 43:12.945
There is no way to reach the bomb in time.
Save yourself.

43:13.445 --> 43:17.699
She can't. The exit is booby-trapped.
We're about to be terminated.

43:18.408 --> 43:21.620
Havitol wouldn't have bothered to
try to stop me...

43:21.703 --> 43:23.956
unless there was a way
to stop the bomb, right?

43:24.039 --> 43:27.042
A logical but unfortunately
useless conclusion.

43:27.584 --> 43:29.086
Maybe not.

43:42.599 --> 43:44.935
The bomb will soon explode.

43:46.645 --> 43:48.313
Goodbye, Diana Prince.

43:48.396 --> 43:51.483
You never were much of an optimist,
were you, Ira?

45:49.141 --> 45:50.643
What, Havitol?

45:50.976 --> 45:53.270
What were you afraid I'd get to?

46:04.239 --> 46:05.699
Electricity.

46:06.325 --> 46:07.451
The timer.

46:25.886 --> 46:27.512
Good morning, Diana.

46:27.596 --> 46:31.225
Good morning, Cori.
I'm sorry to interrupt anything.

46:32.601 --> 46:36.688
Cori was briefing me on the capture of
Havitol and his two cohorts.

46:36.813 --> 46:41.151
It was fortunate that Havitol had her make
all the arrangements for their escape.

46:41.234 --> 46:43.987
That's true. They were on their way
to Hong Kong.

46:44.071 --> 46:47.157
Now they're on their way to prison,
thanks to what she told us.

46:47.240 --> 46:50.035
What will happen to Cori now,
Diana Prince?

46:53.163 --> 46:57.292
I'm afraid she'll be returned home
with the rest of the stolen programs.

46:58.502 --> 47:01.379
I find her input very satisfying.

47:02.088 --> 47:04.216
Why, thank you, Ira.

47:04.925 --> 47:09.012
Ira, I didn't know that you were
programmed for subjective feelings.

47:09.387 --> 47:12.933
We all have our secrets,
don't We, Diana Prince?

47:14.517 --> 47:16.728
Speaking of programs...

47:16.936 --> 47:19.481
you've got some work to do
on our little friend here.

47:19.564 --> 47:23.860
So far he's damaged two doors,
four desks, a lamp, and three ankles.

47:24.444 --> 47:25.945
Aw, shucks.

47:26.237 --> 47:27.906
And his manners are atrocious.

47:27.989 --> 47:29.657
I've got something for you.

47:32.368 --> 47:34.829
Don't tell me. My morning coffee.

47:48.009 --> 47:50.094
What's a desk or two, right?

48:40.561 --> 48:41.645
English
