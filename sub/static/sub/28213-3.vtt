00:03.672 --> 00:05.950
You only ever knew him as the man
you wanted him to be.

00:05.951 --> 00:07.399
You only knew him as a boy!

00:07.400 --> 00:08.779
You made sure of that.

00:08.780 --> 00:12.067
We want you home,
we're both worried sick.

00:12.068 --> 00:13.432
Just come home.

00:13.485 --> 00:14.892
I took the story to Caden.

00:14.893 --> 00:16.172
You know what he says?

00:16.172 --> 00:18.348
"It was a robbery gone wrong."

00:18.349 --> 00:20.908
Any newspapers use your services?

00:20.909 --> 00:23.340
Your son will face significant
challenges.

00:23.341 --> 00:25.708
They might be aggressive
when they were gentle,

00:25.709 --> 00:28.076
indiscreet when they were tactful.

00:28.077 --> 00:31.596
And without this filter,
every thought can become a speech.

00:31.597 --> 00:33.688
I did... your... phone.

00:36.845 --> 00:37.868
Caden, what, is it?

00:37.869 --> 00:38.869
Help!

00:39.277 --> 00:40.277
Help!

00:40.301 --> 00:41.483
Caden, Caden!

00:43.373 --> 00:47.283
This programme contains
very strong language

02:19.309 --> 02:22.037
On the day Tonia went missing,

02:23.213 --> 02:25.123
we'd had an argument.

02:26.093 --> 02:28.275
The last words I said...

02:29.549 --> 02:32.186
...to my daughter were angry.

02:33.837 --> 02:34.928
And hurtful.

02:37.741 --> 02:40.105
I didn't mean any of them.

02:42.541 --> 02:45.996
I want... I want to take them
all back.

02:48.493 --> 02:49.584
But I can't.

02:51.501 --> 02:54.956
I wish I could tell her that
I'm sorry,

02:55.405 --> 02:57.224
and that I love her.

02:59.693 --> 03:02.784
I'm never going to get the chance.

03:06.097 --> 03:08.461
Friends, family, suspects.

03:11.405 --> 03:13.132
After a discussion with the police,

03:13.133 --> 03:17.100
we're offering a reward of Â£30,000
for any information that leads to

03:17.101 --> 03:19.738
the arrest of Tonia's killer.

03:19.789 --> 03:21.971
We'll open to questions.

03:23.565 --> 03:27.852
Can I ask about the role
Reporter Media Group are playing

03:27.853 --> 03:29.853
in this investigation?

03:30.029 --> 03:34.380
We'll do as much, or as little,
as we're asked to do.

03:34.381 --> 03:35.654
One follow up.

03:36.941 --> 03:38.214
Who asked you?

03:38.413 --> 03:40.686
The family or the police?

06:43.629 --> 06:44.629
A.

06:46.253 --> 06:47.253
B.

06:47.917 --> 06:48.917
D, C.

06:52.653 --> 06:53.653
A, B.

06:58.221 --> 06:59.221
C, D.

07:07.437 --> 07:08.437
Why?

07:10.317 --> 07:11.317
Why?

07:14.349 --> 07:15.531
I don't know.

07:17.229 --> 07:18.229
It just is.

07:20.685 --> 07:21.776
I... forgot.

07:24.717 --> 07:26.172
You'll remember.

07:27.533 --> 07:28.533
Speaking.

07:30.157 --> 07:31.157
Spelling.

07:31.309 --> 07:32.844
It's already so much better...

07:32.845 --> 07:33.845
Fucking.

07:36.557 --> 07:37.900
We'll talk about that.

07:37.901 --> 07:40.447
We'll talk about everything.

07:40.973 --> 07:41.973
What is...

07:45.069 --> 07:46.342
...left of me?

08:10.861 --> 08:12.043
What was I...

08:13.421 --> 08:14.967
...always this...

08:18.157 --> 08:19.157
This...?

08:21.421 --> 08:22.421
...angry?

08:22.829 --> 08:23.829
No.

08:27.693 --> 08:28.875
I don't know.

08:31.661 --> 08:33.025
You don't know?

08:33.260 --> 08:34.989
You hid everything.

08:37.933 --> 08:40.206
I can't be a child again.

08:41.453 --> 08:43.181
You're not a child!

08:44.461 --> 08:46.098
I... I can't walk.

08:48.493 --> 08:49.493
Can't wash.

08:50.669 --> 08:51.760
Can't speak.

08:53.293 --> 08:54.293
Can't work.

08:55.469 --> 08:56.469
Can't fuck.

08:56.749 --> 08:57.749
Caden...

08:57.773 --> 08:58.864
Caden can't!

08:59.757 --> 09:01.757
Caden can... can what?

09:02.189 --> 09:04.735
Can shit, can piss, can cry?

09:13.581 --> 09:14.763
Where is Dad?

09:18.253 --> 09:19.253
Abroad.

09:19.661 --> 09:20.661
A... broad?

09:21.581 --> 09:22.581
Yeah.

09:23.501 --> 09:24.865
Abroad.Working.

09:25.805 --> 09:27.169
Abroad, abroad.

09:29.837 --> 09:30.837
A-a-a...

09:31.181 --> 09:33.676
...shamed.No, no, that's not true.

09:33.677 --> 09:36.108
Ashamed. Your dad wants you back
by his side.

09:36.109 --> 09:38.473
Your dad wants you better.

09:39.437 --> 09:41.983
Better? He always want me...

09:43.597 --> 09:44.597
...better.

09:44.877 --> 09:46.241
Now look at me!

09:51.085 --> 09:52.267
He want this?

09:55.629 --> 09:56.811
He want this?

09:58.701 --> 10:02.412
Your dad could've paid for any hospital
in the world, and he chose this place

10:02.413 --> 10:05.932
because this place is about
sending people back to work.

10:05.933 --> 10:07.115
This place...

10:07.213 --> 10:08.486
...teach me...

10:08.813 --> 10:10.028
...not always...

10:10.029 --> 10:11.939
...better to survive.

10:19.373 --> 10:22.101
Will you never say that again?

10:24.301 --> 10:25.301
I am...

10:26.029 --> 10:27.029
...sorry.

10:27.181 --> 10:28.181
What for?

10:29.549 --> 10:30.549
I stop...

10:32.237 --> 10:33.419
...your life.

10:35.821 --> 10:37.276
You ARE my life.

10:52.717 --> 10:53.717
A... B...

10:56.045 --> 10:57.045
...C... D?

11:01.357 --> 11:02.903
A... B... C... D.

11:17.229 --> 11:20.748
There's nothing soft about what
we do here.

11:20.749 --> 11:24.140
Our role is to return our soldiers
to the front line, battle ready.

11:24.141 --> 11:26.380
This is not a recuperation retreat.

11:26.381 --> 11:28.620
And we have never accepted
civilian patients.

11:28.621 --> 11:29.708
I understand.

11:29.709 --> 11:32.460
Considering the circumstances,
I find that very hard to believe.

11:32.461 --> 11:34.572
It's wrong that Caden should be
allowed to recover here

11:34.573 --> 11:36.816
among soldiers
because of who his father is.

11:36.817 --> 11:38.028
It offends you.

11:38.029 --> 11:39.628
This isn't about a personal
grievance.

11:39.629 --> 11:41.164
This is my professional opinion.

11:41.165 --> 11:43.468
Your son is not a soldier.

11:43.469 --> 11:47.244
He has no experience of war, no
connection with the other men and women.

11:47.245 --> 11:51.404
His presence here undermines
our ethos and my authority

11:51.405 --> 11:57.548
because he represents - and I'll be
blunt - a corruption of our ideals.

11:57.549 --> 12:00.364
We're talking about a young man
trying to put his life back together.

12:00.365 --> 12:02.796
You can afford any
hospital in the world.

12:02.797 --> 12:04.524
It's not about the facilities.

12:04.525 --> 12:08.108
You don't teach these men and women
to accept a set of limitations.

12:08.109 --> 12:10.860
Now, Max wants his son
back by his side.

12:10.861 --> 12:13.356
And this is Caden's best chance.

12:13.357 --> 12:18.028
And when it comes to my son, I'll accept
any advantage, fair or otherwise,

12:18.029 --> 12:21.100
and if it was your son,
you'd do the same.

12:21.101 --> 12:22.465
No, I wouldn't.

12:24.941 --> 12:26.924
Well, then, either you've
never had children,

12:26.925 --> 12:29.289
or you've never had power.

12:30.189 --> 12:33.462
We're not going to get along,
are we?

14:39.661 --> 14:42.096
Don't leave a message,
just your name and number.

14:42.097 --> 14:43.825
I'll ring you back.

14:44.589 --> 14:47.317
Your voicemail? Really? Today?

14:49.069 --> 14:50.342
Can't be here.

14:51.181 --> 14:53.228
And I'm sure you're
very busy with...

14:53.229 --> 14:54.956
...big important stuff.

14:54.957 --> 14:56.139
But I know...

14:59.565 --> 15:02.565
...I know you're hiding from him.

15:20.877 --> 15:23.059
Gracias. De nada, Senor.

15:24.461 --> 15:26.828
Buenos dias. ALL: Buenos dias.
Max Frinch.

15:26.829 --> 15:30.156
Felipe Alarcon, the
Institutional Revolutionary Party.

15:30.157 --> 15:31.157
Great.

15:31.181 --> 15:34.060
Patricia Magana, National
Action Party. Thank you.

15:34.061 --> 15:38.092
Ignacio Cortes, the Party
of the Democratic Revolution.

15:38.093 --> 15:39.639
Please follow us.

15:43.981 --> 15:48.268
We're here to discuss your purchase
of Grupo Omera Editorial.

15:48.269 --> 15:53.580
Newspaper sales are declining here,
as they are around the world.

15:53.581 --> 15:57.228
Do you really think you can buy
political influence?

15:57.229 --> 16:01.644
Some argue that you're planning to
take on Telefa Media.

16:01.645 --> 16:03.645
But this is fanciful -

16:03.821 --> 16:06.764
they're the largest media
organisation in the world.Mm-hm.

16:06.765 --> 16:09.772
You're an outsider
with an overpriced foothold

16:09.773 --> 16:11.955
and high-school Spanish.

16:16.685 --> 16:17.685
Yeah.

16:19.057 --> 16:22.967
I apologise
if my Spanish is not yet fluent.

16:23.341 --> 16:25.614
I'll redouble my efforts.

16:26.157 --> 16:27.628
As to your concerns,

16:27.629 --> 16:31.357
let me be clear -
I believe in the assets.

16:31.917 --> 16:33.463
No more, no less.

16:34.605 --> 16:39.216
You cannot offer one party, or one
president, favourable coverage in

16:39.217 --> 16:43.820
exchange for commercial advantage,
as you do in the United Kingdom.

16:43.821 --> 16:47.020
What Patricia means is that
Telefa Media already protects

16:47.021 --> 16:50.604
the Institutional Revolutionary
Party and the National Action Party.

16:50.605 --> 16:52.424
They don't need you.

16:52.461 --> 16:56.300
The only party which doesn't
have its hands dirty is mine.

16:56.301 --> 17:01.301
And I am here to tell you
that my party is not for sale.

17:01.613 --> 17:06.028
Look, I have no interest, I have no
wish, to interfere with your politics.

17:06.029 --> 17:09.740
I bought these newspapers
so that I can live here with my wife

17:09.741 --> 17:10.896
and my new family.

17:10.896 --> 17:14.859
I can't live in a country
that I'm not invested in.

17:14.861 --> 17:17.952
I want to learn Spanish... better.

17:18.317 --> 17:20.317
I want to be a father.

17:20.941 --> 17:22.487
Sell some papers.

17:22.540 --> 17:23.540
That's all.

17:29.837 --> 17:33.996
Has Sofia taken you to the
pyramids of Teotihuacan?

17:33.997 --> 17:38.088
No, um, I'm sorry to say,
I'm a lousy tourist.

17:38.605 --> 17:41.612
Painted on the temple
walls of this ancient landlocked

17:41.613 --> 17:43.340
civilisation are seashells.

17:43.341 --> 17:44.796
Seashells? Yeah.

17:45.069 --> 17:47.884
People from the Gulf of Mexico
must have brought them.

17:47.885 --> 17:50.795
And the Teotihuacan were amazed.

17:51.149 --> 17:53.388
They'd never seen the sea.

17:53.389 --> 17:56.662
Senor, you cannot bring us
seashells.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.546
We are not amazed.

17:58.701 --> 18:01.701
We have seen men like you before.

18:02.989 --> 18:07.535
I thought you didn't want to
talk to me separately?

18:10.477 --> 18:13.100
What did your wife say
when you told her

18:13.101 --> 18:16.647
you wanted to buy
Grupo Omera Editorial?

18:17.581 --> 18:19.581
Said it was a mistake.

18:20.141 --> 18:22.141
What were her reasons?

18:22.253 --> 18:25.068
She said I didn't understand Mexico.

18:25.069 --> 18:28.972
And in the end,
I would lose a great deal of money.

18:28.973 --> 18:32.337
You should have listened
to your wife.

18:46.381 --> 18:47.381
Ah!

19:01.485 --> 19:02.485
Lauren.

19:48.013 --> 19:49.377
They're asleep.

19:55.757 --> 19:57.932
What are you working on?

19:57.933 --> 19:59.661
A couple of things.

20:00.173 --> 20:01.264
With Maggie?

20:01.773 --> 20:05.046
What are you working on with Maggie?

20:09.133 --> 20:12.315
Are you thinking about lying to me?

20:13.485 --> 20:15.758
The press and the police.

20:16.621 --> 20:18.440
What does that mean?

20:18.733 --> 20:21.100
The relationship between them.

20:21.101 --> 20:22.738
You ARE the press.

20:25.645 --> 20:28.332
Are you investigating
your own paper?

20:28.333 --> 20:32.876
That's the second time you've
considered lying... Yes.

20:32.877 --> 20:37.605
And who's going to print
whatever it is you discover?

20:38.573 --> 20:39.755
I don't know.

20:42.797 --> 20:45.036
It might come to nothing.

20:45.037 --> 20:47.128
You don't believe that?

20:48.749 --> 20:49.749
No.

20:51.245 --> 20:53.996
Are you going to lose your job?

20:53.997 --> 20:56.634
I'm not going to lose my job.

20:59.245 --> 21:01.064
I could lose my job.

21:24.653 --> 21:28.300
Your lot says it was
a robbery gone wrong.

21:28.301 --> 21:31.665
No-one strangles
a man for a computer.

21:31.757 --> 21:33.667
Doesn't sound likely.

21:35.981 --> 21:38.709
What's the unofficial version?

21:39.697 --> 21:43.148
I'm going to need another
pint before I tell you that story.

21:43.149 --> 21:44.422
I'll get them.

21:44.941 --> 21:45.941
My round.

21:47.821 --> 21:49.549
Same again, Jackie.

22:10.349 --> 22:11.895
Who did you call?

22:14.189 --> 22:15.280
How high up?

22:21.293 --> 22:23.657
How long till they arrive?

22:25.389 --> 22:26.389
30 minutes.

22:30.637 --> 22:34.910
We don't have to say
anything else, then, do we?

23:17.805 --> 23:20.748
He was no good. I don't doubt it.

23:20.749 --> 23:23.386
Blackmailing his own clients.

23:25.101 --> 23:26.101
What about?

23:27.725 --> 23:28.725
Who knows?

23:29.581 --> 23:30.581
This.

23:30.733 --> 23:31.733
That.

23:32.333 --> 23:33.333
The other.

23:34.829 --> 23:39.375
So he might have been
killed by one of his clients?

23:40.525 --> 23:41.798
He might have.

23:42.957 --> 23:44.230
What if, er...

23:46.669 --> 23:49.033
...he only had one client?

23:55.757 --> 23:56.939
It's a shame.

23:58.573 --> 24:00.573
Getting so principled.

24:02.285 --> 24:04.467
Over a man who had none.

24:39.533 --> 24:40.533
Morning.

24:46.253 --> 24:48.890
Why didn't you call for help?

24:50.413 --> 24:51.686
Night nurse...

24:51.693 --> 24:52.844
...was a woman.

24:52.845 --> 24:54.391
She doesn't care.

24:56.621 --> 24:57.621
I care.

24:58.669 --> 25:00.397
Yeah, I understand.

25:11.341 --> 25:14.614
Hey? We're going to have a good day.

25:15.309 --> 25:17.219
I want you to say it.

25:19.661 --> 25:21.571
I want you to say it.

25:23.377 --> 25:24.377
What?

25:24.781 --> 25:25.781
We...

25:32.397 --> 25:33.397
We...

25:33.677 --> 25:35.041
...are going...

25:36.109 --> 25:37.109
...are...

25:38.669 --> 25:39.669
...going...

25:39.821 --> 25:41.821
...to have a good day.

25:41.933 --> 25:42.933
...to...

25:44.109 --> 25:45.109
...have...

25:45.645 --> 25:46.645
...a...

25:47.693 --> 25:48.693
...good...

25:50.125 --> 25:51.125
...day.

25:52.749 --> 25:55.820
It's as if you're kicking
a football. A big push.

25:55.821 --> 25:58.892
Keep that pelvis straighter,
if you can.

25:58.893 --> 26:00.748
And squeeze in with your core
and your chin up.

26:00.749 --> 26:02.092
That's it, good.

26:02.093 --> 26:03.093
Chin up.

26:05.613 --> 26:06.764
That's it, that's good.

26:06.765 --> 26:07.765
Faster.

26:08.429 --> 26:12.204
Not too fast.
Take it easy, you're doing well.

26:12.205 --> 26:15.205
Remember, kick your foot through.

26:15.217 --> 26:16.763
Come on, kick it.

26:16.941 --> 26:17.941
Yep.

26:18.157 --> 26:20.339
Come on. Give me a hand.

26:27.181 --> 26:28.181
No privacy.

26:29.101 --> 26:30.101
I know.

26:34.157 --> 26:35.157
No privacy.

26:37.037 --> 26:39.532
I need to make sure
you're all right.

26:39.533 --> 26:40.533
Funny.

26:41.325 --> 26:42.325
What is?

26:42.989 --> 26:43.989
No privacy.

26:44.977 --> 26:46.614
Why is that funny?

26:47.021 --> 26:48.021
I take it.

26:49.453 --> 26:50.453
Take what?

26:51.885 --> 26:52.885
Privacy.

26:53.933 --> 26:55.024
You take it?

26:55.213 --> 26:57.213
I take it... from you.

27:00.333 --> 27:01.697
I don't follow.

27:02.253 --> 27:03.344
I take it...

27:04.109 --> 27:05.200
...from you.

27:06.733 --> 27:07.733
From you.

27:08.333 --> 27:09.333
From you.

27:09.677 --> 27:10.677
From you.

27:11.789 --> 27:12.971
I find out...

27:13.901 --> 27:15.174
...anything...

27:16.205 --> 27:17.205
...anyone.

27:18.893 --> 27:21.712
Even if you are Prime Minister.

27:23.377 --> 27:26.014
Even if you are Royal family.

27:27.661 --> 27:29.571
I take it from you...

27:31.693 --> 27:32.966
...no privacy.

27:35.725 --> 27:37.453
And now look at me!

27:41.421 --> 27:43.058
No privacy for me.

27:49.229 --> 27:50.593
Sometimes, I...

27:51.597 --> 27:52.779
...I speak...

27:53.325 --> 27:54.507
...not think.

27:54.669 --> 27:55.669
It's OK.

27:56.909 --> 27:58.364
Just blah, blah.

27:59.277 --> 28:01.641
You don't need to explain.

28:02.093 --> 28:03.436
Don't mean nothing.

28:03.437 --> 28:04.801
Nothing at all.

28:06.829 --> 28:08.102
I'm... scared.

28:10.541 --> 28:11.541
Why?

28:14.189 --> 28:15.189
Don't tell.

28:15.533 --> 28:17.079
Who would I tell?

28:19.437 --> 28:20.437
Father.

28:50.221 --> 28:51.221
Juan?

28:54.509 --> 28:55.509
Gracias.

28:59.757 --> 29:00.757
Chicos?

29:01.677 --> 29:02.677
Por favor.

29:06.989 --> 29:07.989
Si? Si?

30:06.061 --> 30:07.061
Hola.Hola.

30:58.349 --> 30:59.622
Por favor? Si.

31:14.093 --> 31:16.275
Gracias. De nada, Senor.

31:21.901 --> 31:22.901
Vale.

31:56.205 --> 31:57.205
Mm-mm.

32:06.317 --> 32:07.317
Max?

32:08.557 --> 32:09.648
How are you?

32:10.989 --> 32:11.989
I'm fine.

32:12.269 --> 32:13.360
How's Caden?

32:14.189 --> 32:15.735
I'm with him now.

32:17.709 --> 32:19.982
When are you coming back?

32:21.677 --> 32:22.859
I don't know.

32:22.957 --> 32:24.776
I really don't know.

32:26.477 --> 32:27.568
Talk to him.

32:28.909 --> 32:30.000
Is he ready?

32:30.061 --> 32:32.425
I'm passing him the phone.

32:37.997 --> 32:38.997
Dad?

32:39.213 --> 32:40.486
Hello, my son!

32:43.885 --> 32:44.976
I'm doing...

32:46.829 --> 32:48.193
...really well.

32:49.197 --> 32:50.220
That's good.

32:50.221 --> 32:51.949
That's really good.

32:52.909 --> 32:53.909
You'd be...

32:55.213 --> 32:56.213
...proud.

33:02.381 --> 33:04.654
When are you coming back?

33:08.909 --> 33:11.364
Soon. I'm coming back soon.

33:34.893 --> 33:36.530
You must be Caden.

33:36.941 --> 33:37.941
I'm Pam.

33:40.141 --> 33:42.505
Done any gardening before?

33:42.509 --> 33:44.600
Gardening is for cunts.

33:44.877 --> 33:46.668
I've never heard it
put like that before!

33:46.669 --> 33:48.908
Sorry, Caden just says whatever
comes into his head.

33:48.909 --> 33:50.956
Don't you, mate? That's fine.

33:50.957 --> 33:53.139
I can take it from here.

33:55.373 --> 33:56.555
There you go.

34:32.556 --> 34:33.830
Tomato plants.

34:35.693 --> 34:38.507
She always gives the newcomers
tomato plants.

34:38.509 --> 34:43.054
Do you know why?
They're almost impossible to kill.

34:43.565 --> 34:48.815
The idea of a plant dying - a plant
that you're responsible for -

34:48.817 --> 34:52.998
that could be very
traumatic for some soldiers.

34:53.741 --> 34:55.831
Might trigger memories.

34:56.940 --> 35:01.214
I've seen grown men cry over
a wilted sunflower.

35:03.469 --> 35:05.015
I like your face.

35:05.453 --> 35:06.453
My face?

35:07.309 --> 35:08.309
Yes.

35:10.573 --> 35:12.483
No-one likes my face.

35:13.773 --> 35:16.460
It's the most honest face
I've ever seen.

35:16.461 --> 35:17.461
Honest?

35:17.549 --> 35:19.095
You repeat a lot.

35:20.301 --> 35:21.483
Brain damage?

35:21.517 --> 35:22.517
No.

35:25.101 --> 35:26.101
Yes.

35:28.301 --> 35:29.392
Can I touch?

35:34.957 --> 35:37.594
I can feel how you were made.

35:40.013 --> 35:42.832
How they put you back together.

35:45.261 --> 35:46.261
I'm Caden.

35:48.013 --> 35:49.741
I know who you are.

35:50.957 --> 35:53.412
Everyone knows who you are.

35:56.781 --> 35:58.781
Can you keep a secret?

35:59.981 --> 36:00.981
Not really.

36:08.497 --> 36:10.316
What was the secret?

37:03.341 --> 37:08.523
You do not have say anything
that may harm your defence...

37:36.429 --> 37:38.924
We're saying it's a
tip-off from a reader?

37:38.925 --> 37:42.198
Yes, the police found her hairbrush.

37:45.133 --> 37:48.332
Are you sure this is a good idea -
a press conference for Caden?

37:48.333 --> 37:50.892
Your son was the face
of this company.

37:50.893 --> 37:55.500
Either you answer questions
about him, or your enemies will.

37:55.501 --> 37:56.774
What do I say?

37:57.741 --> 38:00.741
You say how proud you are of him.

38:03.757 --> 38:05.292
Will Caden stand beside me?

38:05.293 --> 38:06.293
No.

38:06.573 --> 38:09.028
No, he might say something.

38:10.989 --> 38:13.548
No, if I do this, I want him
there beside me.

38:13.549 --> 38:15.852
I want him there, or
I look like a fraud.

38:15.853 --> 38:18.220
He has no control over his body
and his speech.

38:18.221 --> 38:20.076
He can't stand in front
of all those cameras.

38:20.077 --> 38:22.259
It's too much of a risk.

38:24.877 --> 38:25.877
Nick?

38:27.181 --> 38:29.228
Good to meet you, I'm a fan.

38:29.229 --> 38:30.700
That's very kind.

38:30.701 --> 38:32.428
Well, I'll leave you two to talk.

38:32.429 --> 38:36.844
I just wanted you to know you're
very important to this paper.

38:36.845 --> 38:38.252
That's very kind.

38:38.253 --> 38:40.072
I said that already.

38:40.177 --> 38:41.450
Yeah, you did.

39:45.069 --> 39:46.615
Come on. Come on.

39:47.629 --> 39:49.676
Just put the float down.

39:49.677 --> 39:51.660
Just do a bit more, then finish up,
right?

39:51.661 --> 39:53.900
Get your left leg in. Got it?

39:53.901 --> 39:56.140
OK, now I'm going to hold you.

39:56.141 --> 39:58.828
I just want you to push through
with your right leg.

39:58.829 --> 40:00.920
Just trying to... Whoa!

40:01.069 --> 40:04.888
Ah! Ah! You're OK, you're OK,
I've got you.

40:06.765 --> 40:09.415
Right, you know what?
Let's finish for today.

40:09.416 --> 40:12.871
I should stay in
and do more exercises.

40:14.792 --> 40:16.247
Yeah, good idea.

40:17.224 --> 40:20.134
I'll catch up with your mum. OK?

40:40.584 --> 40:41.584
Who's she?

40:42.184 --> 40:43.366
I don't know.

40:45.576 --> 40:47.758
Is he flirting with her?

40:48.456 --> 40:50.375
I feel like we shouldn't be
watching.

40:50.376 --> 40:52.104
Are you kidding me?

41:18.472 --> 41:23.654
No-one has ever loitered
in a swimming pool for me before.

41:28.460 --> 41:31.642
I don't have anything funny to say.

41:34.984 --> 41:36.263
You can't lie, can you?

41:36.264 --> 41:38.264
I need to learn again.

41:42.472 --> 41:44.391
Maybe this time, don't.

41:44.392 --> 41:46.567
It's harder to live without them.

41:46.568 --> 41:49.114
It's hard to live with them.

41:52.264 --> 41:55.901
I still don't have anything funny
to say.

42:00.712 --> 42:03.985
You have an idea about us,
don't you?

42:06.152 --> 42:07.152
What idea?

42:14.024 --> 42:16.661
You make me feel something...

42:18.120 --> 42:19.302
...in here...

42:22.472 --> 42:24.200
...when you talk...

42:25.544 --> 42:27.181
...when I see you.

42:29.768 --> 42:34.132
I'm nervous, like... like
my first day of school.

42:40.776 --> 42:42.231
I can't fix you.

42:45.064 --> 42:46.610
You can't fix me.

42:47.112 --> 42:48.567
You'll get hurt.

42:48.904 --> 42:50.450
I'm already hurt.

43:44.584 --> 43:46.948
You don't have to do this.

45:15.656 --> 45:17.384
Good boy, good boy!

45:26.152 --> 45:29.351
We're ready, and we've made it clear
you're not answering any questions.

45:29.352 --> 45:30.534
OK.Good luck.

45:36.392 --> 45:37.847
You'll be great.

45:53.672 --> 45:54.672
Hello.

45:57.260 --> 46:00.897
OK, thank you.
We'll have pictures later.

46:01.352 --> 46:02.716
Good afternoon.

46:04.296 --> 46:07.842
Six weeks ago,
my son suffered a stroke.

46:08.776 --> 46:12.867
It's a parent's duty
to look after their kids,

46:13.064 --> 46:14.519
to protect them,

46:14.856 --> 46:16.038
and I failed.

46:16.520 --> 46:18.157
No, Dad, I failed.

46:19.340 --> 46:20.340
No. No.

46:21.192 --> 46:23.374
No, you didn't. It's OK.

46:24.008 --> 46:25.645
Closer, come here.

46:28.296 --> 46:30.206
I stand here today...

46:31.688 --> 46:33.688
...so proud of my son.

46:35.464 --> 46:39.555
I'm so proud of the progress
that he has made.

46:41.096 --> 46:44.915
He's a fighter, this kid,
like his old man.

46:46.024 --> 46:48.391
And, of course,
I really want to thank

46:48.392 --> 46:51.143
the extraordinary staff
working here.

46:51.144 --> 46:55.175
Every place I look around here,
I see expressions

46:55.176 --> 46:56.995
of the human spirit.

46:57.160 --> 47:00.251
Our determination, our resilience.

47:03.048 --> 47:09.048
It's an honour for my son to begin
his voyage back from this place.

47:10.344 --> 47:14.375
And the donation I was able to make
towards the opening of a new wing

47:14.376 --> 47:17.740
is a token of my gratitude.
Thank you.

47:18.472 --> 47:19.654
We fall sick,

47:20.904 --> 47:22.268
we fall down...

47:25.064 --> 47:27.246
...but we never give up.

47:28.584 --> 47:29.584
Thank you.

47:38.568 --> 47:40.807
We'll take questions. Hm!

47:40.808 --> 47:43.536
Er... yes?

47:43.624 --> 47:45.863
Will Caden be returning
to the post of editor?

47:45.864 --> 47:49.864
That is our expectation, yes.
You bet I will!

48:22.220 --> 48:24.766
It's OK. Are you sure? Yeah.

48:26.568 --> 48:27.568
You OK?

48:43.272 --> 48:44.272
OK.

49:03.304 --> 49:06.577
Hang on, let me do that.
Let me help.

49:15.272 --> 49:16.363
There we go.

49:28.776 --> 49:29.776
Mm!

49:30.380 --> 49:32.380
They offered me a job.

49:32.552 --> 49:34.098
In Washington DC.

49:37.608 --> 49:38.608
A bribe.

49:39.720 --> 49:40.720
Mm.

49:45.096 --> 49:46.642
I didn't say yes.

49:51.432 --> 49:53.069
You didn't say no.

49:55.464 --> 49:56.464
Hm?

50:02.248 --> 50:03.248
All right.

50:29.064 --> 50:30.064
Dad?

50:30.600 --> 50:31.600
Yeah?

50:36.488 --> 50:37.670
How did I do?

50:41.352 --> 50:42.716
How did you do?

50:42.824 --> 50:43.824
Today.

50:53.896 --> 50:55.078
You did well.

50:58.056 --> 50:59.875
You did really well.

51:17.384 --> 51:18.475
What was it?

51:20.392 --> 51:22.302
Nothing. He did well.

51:22.312 --> 51:23.767
Don't lie to me.

51:29.672 --> 51:32.299
Was it his mobility? His speech?

51:32.300 --> 51:33.300
His memory?

51:33.704 --> 51:37.543
It wasn't his memory,
it wasn't his speech. Then what?

51:37.544 --> 51:39.363
He asked how he did.

51:41.832 --> 51:44.378
He asked...? "How did I do?"

51:45.544 --> 51:46.544
So?

51:49.256 --> 51:53.351
I walk into a room, I tell you,
"This is what we're going to do".

51:53.352 --> 51:55.719
I tell you, "This is how I did".

51:55.720 --> 51:59.175
I don't ask, "How did I do?"
I already know.

51:59.176 --> 52:04.813
And if I don't know, or I'm unsure,
I shouldn't be in this job.

52:05.576 --> 52:07.879
What are you saying -
he can't work for you?

52:07.880 --> 52:08.880
No!

52:09.740 --> 52:11.975
There's no chance?! None!

52:11.976 --> 52:14.407
But he's going to get better,
he's going to train harder!

52:14.408 --> 52:16.071
It's not anything to do
with the stroke!

52:16.072 --> 52:18.254
Well, then, what is it?!

52:19.976 --> 52:24.391
He could run my business from a
wheelchair, I wouldn't care at all.

52:24.392 --> 52:26.631
He could slur his words,
it wouldn't matter to me,

52:26.632 --> 52:29.996
if he was the right man,
but he isn't!

52:30.024 --> 52:32.839
And it isn't because
something is different,

52:32.840 --> 52:35.143
because nothing has changed!

52:35.144 --> 52:36.781
He's the same man!

52:38.792 --> 52:40.429
The difference is,

52:40.648 --> 52:43.376
before, I saw my son, an idea.

52:45.384 --> 52:47.657
A hope, a dream. Today...

52:50.760 --> 52:54.488
...today, I saw him.
I saw... I saw Caden.

52:55.432 --> 52:59.432
I saw a man who needs to ask,
"How did I do?"

53:01.896 --> 53:05.169
He's an employee, he's not a leader.

53:05.992 --> 53:08.423
That's who he is, that's who he was,

53:08.424 --> 53:11.061
that's who he will always be.

53:11.432 --> 53:13.523
Now, tell me I'm wrong.

53:19.176 --> 53:20.839
I knew he was nothing like you.

53:20.840 --> 53:22.695
Caden knows. He's always known.

53:22.696 --> 53:24.935
He's always known.
That's why he was so unhappy.

53:24.936 --> 53:27.111
Lauren knows, everybody knows,
except me.

53:27.112 --> 53:29.735
There must be another role
we can find in your business.

53:29.736 --> 53:31.783
No, no, no. If he's not going
to run the business,

53:31.784 --> 53:34.983
he can't be in the business.
What, that's it?

53:34.984 --> 53:37.671
Isn't this what you always wanted -
full custody of Caden?

53:37.672 --> 53:39.854
You think I wanted this?

53:41.576 --> 53:44.647
You think I wanted this?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

53:44.648 --> 53:47.655
I mean, Caden thinks he's going
back to work for you.

53:47.656 --> 53:51.111
He's spent his adult entire life...
You're not listening to me!

53:51.112 --> 53:54.631
...preparing to take over...
It's nothing to do with the stroke!

53:54.632 --> 53:58.023
It's him! He's got nothing else!
He has nothing else!

53:58.024 --> 54:02.297
Then he needs to find
something else that's his!

54:05.900 --> 54:07.810
You need to tell him.

54:10.056 --> 54:12.693
He needs to hear it from you.

54:15.944 --> 54:18.763
Yes. He needs to know. I agree.

54:19.720 --> 54:20.720
Today! Now!

54:22.408 --> 54:25.415
Why now? Because he's wasted 20 years
trying to be the man you wanted him to be.

54:25.416 --> 54:27.207
He can't waste another six months.

54:27.208 --> 54:29.255
If he's not you,
he needs to find out who he is.

54:29.256 --> 54:31.943
Let's just get him out of this place
first. This place?

54:31.944 --> 54:33.739
Get him out of this place,
get him on his feet.

54:33.740 --> 54:35.143
What do you think this place is?

54:35.144 --> 54:38.023
This place is about getting you
ready for the next stage your life.

54:38.024 --> 54:41.479
Every day, they remind you of what
your goals are, of what the future is.

54:41.480 --> 54:43.463
Every time, every hour, they say,

54:43.464 --> 54:45.959
"This is why you're learning
how to walk.

54:45.960 --> 54:49.031
"This is why you're learning
how to speak, to eat."

54:49.032 --> 54:52.423
I mean, he cannot build his recovery
on a lie.

54:52.424 --> 54:54.663
Now, you need to tell him.

54:54.664 --> 54:56.779
You need to walk in there now

54:56.780 --> 54:59.326
and tell him that his dream,

54:59.400 --> 55:02.087
that was never his dream,
that was always your dream,

55:02.088 --> 55:06.311
of him being by your side,
that is an old dream. It's dead.

55:06.312 --> 55:08.222
He needs a new dream.

55:09.512 --> 55:11.943
For the first time in his life,

55:11.944 --> 55:13.763
his dream, his life.

55:20.904 --> 55:21.995
He's asleep.

55:23.336 --> 55:26.973
Well, he's got to wake up, Max,
you know.

55:28.776 --> 55:30.413
Yeah. Yes, I know.
