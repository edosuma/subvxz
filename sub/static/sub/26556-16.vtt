And that is not what I'm talking about.

12:59.136 --> 13:00.844
We are the kids of vigilantes.

My last name isn't Clayton anymore.

And, besides, all the focus is

13:05.584 --> 13:08.068
gonna be on me, the CEO,
anyway, so just play along.

13:08.071 --> 13:11.790
Didn't I ask you to send me the
financials on the Brennan Merger?

13:11.793 --> 13:13.241
It should be there.

13:13.244 --> 13:15.860

my 12:00 with optics.

Once I figured out you were headed here,

14:16.834 --> 14:18.430
I started pulling
credentials for clearance.

you did was lie to me,

I love relationship drama

you think we could focus

14:56.439 --> 14:57.820
So what do you know about this place?

14:57.822 --> 14:59.963
All right. I've been doing
recon on the building.

14:59.966 --> 15:01.256
There are hidden sublevels here,

Well, I have a meeting with the
guy who runs this place, Keven Dale.

15:13.437 --> 15:15.604
I mean, if anyone has access, it's him.

All we have to do is steal
and replicate his DNA. Easy.

15:19.619 --> 15:22.370
It actually is. Look, I have the tech.

with the canaries, but...

15:57.189 --> 15:59.648
I didn't think you were one of them.

15:59.650 --> 16:01.987
Not only did you not stay
away from my daughter,

16:01.990 --> 16:04.537
but you brought Roy into this.

16:04.539 --> 16:06.317
I didn't think you were alive.

Nice to see you, too.

What are you doing slumming
it in Star City anyway?

16:10.593 --> 16:13.162

looking for the bombs.

16:13.165 --> 16:14.914
And you need to stop.

16:14.917 --> 16:17.885
You already know that Galaxy's
behind all this, don't you?

16:17.888 --> 16:21.170
This is the part where you're
supposed to tell me I'm wrong,

16:21.172 --> 16:23.839
that my father, a former vigilante,

16:23.841 --> 16:25.840
is not working with the bad guys.

16:25.843 --> 16:27.292
The bomb plans you saw...

16:27.295 --> 16:29.195
They're phase one of what we're calling

16:35.111 --> 16:36.366
ROY: Really?

16:36.369 --> 16:37.853
Because wiping out an entire city sounds

16:37.855 --> 16:39.013
a lot like genocide.

about destroying Star City.

16:42.478 --> 16:45.583
It's about expanding what
we've done in The Glades.

16:45.586 --> 16:48.296
And with Galaxy's help,
I'll be able to do that

16:48.299 --> 16:49.941

17:08.092 --> 17:09.218
I would know.

Just like you knew
Galaxy was paying cops

Yeah. Yeah, she's still alive, Rene.

24:11.486 --> 24:13.492

24:13.494 --> 24:16.489

24:16.492 --> 24:21.316
above your own, including your family.

24:21.319 --> 24:23.569

you from having to make

24:25.479 --> 24:26.673

attack within our walls

36:14.046 --> 36:16.122
in over a decade.

36:16.124 --> 36:18.216
I vow to you it will be the last.

36:18.218 --> 36:20.126
[COMPUTER BEEPS]

36:20.128 --> 36:22.125
Well, that was disturbing.

36:22.128 --> 36:24.244
I know why my dad had
to make that speech,

36:24.247 --> 36:25.741
but hearing it out loud?

36:25.744 --> 36:27.743
We did already have
a target on our backs,

36:27.746 --> 36:30.055
just, well, not quite that big.

36:30.058 --> 36:32.639
Well, it's about to get
rougher for everyone.

36:32.641 --> 36:34.307
Including my dad.

36:34.309 --> 36:36.643
I know you're worried, but he is right.

36:36.645 --> 36:38.680
The best way to take down Galaxy is

36:38.683 --> 36:40.054
from the inside.

36:40.056 --> 36:41.268
CONNOR: So what now?

36:41.271 --> 36:42.649
So I'm guessing Galaxy's

36:42.651 --> 36:44.433
not just gonna stop at bombing the city.

36:44.435 --> 36:49.105
No. The purpose of the
bombing wasn't to rebuild.

36:49.107 --> 36:52.302
It was to remake Star
City in The Glades' image.

36:52.305 --> 36:53.972
Why would Dale want to ruin a city

36:53.975 --> 36:55.641
he spent so much money to fix?

36:55.644 --> 36:57.477
Because he's gonna use
the shiny new Star City

36:57.480 --> 36:59.430
as a proof of concept
to take Archer Global,

36:59.433 --> 37:01.549
and that's too much power
for one entity to have.

37:01.552 --> 37:03.502
Well, it's a good thing we
got the band back together.

37:03.504 --> 37:05.596
Well, we can thank William for that one.

37:07.083 --> 37:10.518
I sent that signal out
on a hope and a prayer.

37:13.131 --> 37:14.849
And you kept it.

37:14.852 --> 37:19.444
After all these years and with
everything that's happened, I...

37:19.446 --> 37:22.061
I know I don't deserve it.

37:22.064 --> 37:24.449
Well, I'm glad I didn't
completely hate you.

37:24.451 --> 37:26.948
Now I got a sister to hate instead.

37:26.951 --> 37:29.167
I need some air.

37:29.170 --> 37:32.080
So maybe we don't really have
that type of relationship yet.

37:32.083 --> 37:33.482
It's not you.

37:33.484 --> 37:35.709
- I should go talk to her.
- And it's not you.

37:35.712 --> 37:38.797
It's me.

37:38.800 --> 37:41.175
Who needs a drink?

37:46.148 --> 37:49.746
Mr. Mayor, impassioned speech you gave.

37:49.749 --> 37:51.262
It really made me believe

37:51.265 --> 37:53.552
you want those vigilantes dead.

37:53.555 --> 37:56.339
They violated the sanctity of our walls,

37:56.341 --> 37:57.724
not to mention they destroyed

37:57.726 --> 37:59.484
our plans for expansion.

37:59.486 --> 38:01.969
Yes, I want them dead.

38:01.971 --> 38:04.780
They were your friends once.

38:04.783 --> 38:06.349
Your point?

38:06.351 --> 38:08.976
Well, they seemed to know exactly

38:08.978 --> 38:11.939
what we were planning
and how to stop us.

38:11.942 --> 38:14.370
Seeing how it was your desire

38:14.373 --> 38:17.669
to evacuate Star City,
I can't help but wonder...

38:17.671 --> 38:20.750
You did not tell me about
moving up the bomb timeline

38:20.753 --> 38:22.340
till I pressed you on it.

38:22.342 --> 38:26.000
If I'd known, maybe you
wouldn't have kept Felicity Smoak

38:26.003 --> 38:27.762
in the same damn building.

38:30.375 --> 38:31.922
The attack by the vigilantes

38:31.925 --> 38:34.000
has provided us an opportunity.

38:34.003 --> 38:37.397
Because a city in fear
desires a solution.

38:39.768 --> 38:41.768
What is that?

38:41.770 --> 38:44.696
The tool that will allow
us to take Archer Global

38:44.698 --> 38:47.240
and eliminate all vigilantes for good.

38:53.318 --> 38:55.231
Oh, wow.

38:55.233 --> 38:58.298
So this is where you have been spending

38:58.301 --> 39:00.403
all your time.

39:00.406 --> 39:03.424
Pretty much.

39:06.411 --> 39:09.203
Still not a fan of cleaning, I take it.

39:09.205 --> 39:10.984
You want to start by nagging?

39:10.987 --> 39:13.966
Oh, I'm your mother.
Nagging is part of the deal.

39:13.968 --> 39:17.562
So what, you probably want
me to come help stop Galaxy?

39:17.564 --> 39:21.257
A little mother-daughter vigilante time.

39:21.259 --> 39:23.951
No. I wish I could take
you away from all this.

39:23.954 --> 39:26.755
I wish that you didn't have
to think about any of this.

39:31.060 --> 39:33.769
But I know that that is
not my decision to make.

39:33.771 --> 39:36.439
You know, when I first left home,

39:36.441 --> 39:40.210
I was so mad at you.

39:40.212 --> 39:44.447
I learned everything I
could about vigilantes.

39:44.449 --> 39:46.421
I dug up old news stories

39:46.424 --> 39:48.885
about how they destroyed Star City.

39:51.079 --> 39:53.288
I was convinced...

39:53.291 --> 39:55.842
I was convinced it was true

39:55.844 --> 39:59.846
that you had lied to
me my entire childhood

39:59.848 --> 40:03.374
with your... your stories

40:03.377 --> 40:06.260
of the heroism of Team Arrow.

40:06.262 --> 40:08.113
Because you didn't want me

40:08.115 --> 40:10.035
to think badly about you.

40:11.434 --> 40:14.560
Or about dad.

40:14.562 --> 40:17.997
I spent these past years
hating vigilantes...

40:21.862 --> 40:23.954
Because I hated you.

40:23.957 --> 40:26.280
Well, I don't blame you.

40:26.282 --> 40:30.409
I understand why you
wanted to lie to me...

40:30.411 --> 40:32.512
To protect me.

40:34.534 --> 40:37.085
I can't even imagine what it was like

40:37.088 --> 40:39.927
having the entire city turn on you

40:39.929 --> 40:41.837
and turn on dad.

40:41.839 --> 40:48.677
Mia, you are so much like your father.

40:48.679 --> 40:51.656
Out on that field,

40:51.658 --> 40:53.950
so badass.

40:55.943 --> 40:57.951
I'm so proud of you.

41:03.194 --> 41:04.961
Mom, there's, um...

41:06.506 --> 41:09.365
It seemed like there is
something really personal

41:09.367 --> 41:12.469
about you stopping Galaxy.

41:15.682 --> 41:19.017
Is that about dad?

41:19.019 --> 41:20.768
No, it's not.

41:23.172 --> 41:25.214
That one is on me.

41:25.216 --> 41:30.553
Holy crap. Did that work?

41:30.555 --> 41:33.198
Here goes nothing.

41:33.200 --> 41:36.409
Archer, are you online?

41:41.865 --> 41:44.231
COMPUTER: Yes, Ms. Smoak.

41:44.234 --> 41:46.742
Archer is active.

41:46.745 --> 41:48.662
Holy...
