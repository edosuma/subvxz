WEBVTT

00:03.100 --> 00:04.566
Friends.

00:04.566 --> 00:06.133
They're the people
who get you,

00:06.133 --> 00:07.233
support you,

00:07.233 --> 00:10.000
understand you in ways
that others just don't.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.300
They're the people
you share your life with,

00:12.300 --> 00:15.300
but what happens when
your life starts to change?

00:15.300 --> 00:16.600
Oh, hey.

00:16.600 --> 00:17.433
Whoa, hey.

00:17.433 --> 00:18.466
Come on, one piece.

00:18.466 --> 00:21.000
I've got a six hour drive
ahead of me.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.233
That bacon is for Judith.

00:22.233 --> 00:25.000
Please, I am starving.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
(chuckles)
Don't guilt me out.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.233
You're the one who's
abandoning me for the weekend.

00:29.233 --> 00:30.566
It's my cousin's stag.

00:30.566 --> 00:32.166
Fine, one piece.

00:32.166 --> 00:34.033
But don't eat it all
'cause Judith loves bacon.

00:34.033 --> 00:35.166
And scones.

00:35.166 --> 00:36.366
Wow, you're really
going all out.

00:36.366 --> 00:37.233
Yeah...

00:37.233 --> 00:38.333
I'm kind of anxious.

00:38.333 --> 00:40.333
Brunch with your best friend
makes you anxious?

00:40.333 --> 00:43.100
Well, I can't even remember
the last time we hung out.

00:43.100 --> 00:45.700
I mean, we used to see
each other all the time,

00:45.700 --> 00:47.333
talk every day,

00:47.333 --> 00:48.733
but now it's like...

00:48.733 --> 00:50.133
She kinda has a newborn.

00:50.133 --> 00:51.700
I know, but I swear,

00:51.700 --> 00:53.266
every time we make plans,
she cancels.

00:53.266 --> 00:54.666
Well, when Michael had kids,

00:54.666 --> 00:57.200
we went from drinking buddies
to playground patrol.

00:57.200 --> 00:58.200
But you stayed friends.

00:58.200 --> 00:59.200
Sure,
with a few adjustments.

00:59.200 --> 01:00.400
Oh.

01:02.233 --> 01:03.500
(telephone rings)

01:03.500 --> 01:05.033
Why is she calling
from home?

01:05.033 --> 01:06.033
(phone rings)

01:07.100 --> 01:08.366
Hello!

01:08.366 --> 01:10.500
Explain to me why
we're not born with teeth.

01:10.500 --> 01:12.500
I'm gonna go
out on a limb here

01:12.500 --> 01:13.666
and say breast-feeding?

01:13.666 --> 01:16.433
Three hours of sleep,
Erica.

01:16.433 --> 01:17.433
Oh, Jude.

01:18.700 --> 01:21.133
So, I guess that means
we're not--

01:21.133 --> 01:25.500
No, no, I promised myself
I wouldn't cancel, but--

01:25.500 --> 01:27.100
Can we meet up
a little later?

01:27.100 --> 01:29.266
Like at 2 o'clock?

01:29.266 --> 01:31.066
I-I've got baby yoga
this afternoon

01:31.066 --> 01:32.633
near that goblins place
you like.

01:32.633 --> 01:34.266
Not a problem at all.

01:34.266 --> 01:36.200
I will see you then.

01:36.200 --> 01:37.166
(phone beeps off)

01:38.200 --> 01:39.666
Hey, you all right?

01:41.133 --> 01:44.166
For your trip to Montreal,

01:44.166 --> 01:46.466
I give you five scones
and a pound of bacon.

01:46.466 --> 01:48.300
(chuckles)

01:48.300 --> 01:49.700
(passionate kissing)

01:56.700 --> 02:00.333
Hey.

02:00.333 --> 02:02.566
Oh, it's the incredible
growing baby.

02:02.566 --> 02:03.566
Hi.

02:03.566 --> 02:05.266
Oh.

02:05.266 --> 02:07.633
When have we ever gone this
long without hanging out?

02:07.633 --> 02:08.500
I know!

02:08.500 --> 02:10.266
That vanilla latte
is for you

02:10.266 --> 02:12.400
and I wanna hear
everything.

02:12.400 --> 02:13.733
How's Ethan?

02:13.733 --> 02:15.700
Ethan's good.
He's good.

02:15.700 --> 02:18.566
We kind of had this weird thing
happen at Sam's birthday.

02:18.566 --> 02:21.766
But it's, I mean,
ugh, sorry.

02:21.766 --> 02:24.600
Sorry, it's that time again.

02:24.600 --> 02:28.433
It's always that time,
yes, yes.

02:28.433 --> 02:30.433
So now he's in Montreal
for a stag

02:30.433 --> 02:32.033
and of course,
his ex-wife is there.

02:32.033 --> 02:33.300
So, I'm thinking...

02:33.300 --> 02:35.133
So, no, you keep obsessing
over things

02:35.133 --> 02:37.200
that aren't actually
happening.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.433
Well, I guess
you could put it that way.

02:39.433 --> 02:40.500
Alyson:
Judith, Jude!

02:40.500 --> 02:41.333
Hi guys!

02:41.333 --> 02:42.266
Alyson:
Erica, right?

02:42.266 --> 02:44.166
You mind if we join you?

02:44.166 --> 02:47.000
Chaz is out cold and we're,
like, insanely early for yoga.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.033
Mm-hmm.

02:48.033 --> 02:50.533
Alyson:
Oops, okay there?

02:50.533 --> 02:52.566
Marie: Oh, wow, his
feet are freezing.

02:52.566 --> 02:57.000
Judith:
Oh, I've got a blanket.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.566
I don't think that
I'm obsessing.

02:58.566 --> 03:00.633
Oh, sorry
if that came off harsh,

03:00.633 --> 03:02.500
I'm just a little
out of practice.

03:02.500 --> 03:04.600
No, it's fine, I mean,
I want your opinion.

03:04.600 --> 03:05.666
No, no, no!

03:06.666 --> 03:08.633
Oh, do not bite mommy.

03:08.633 --> 03:10.333
When you bite mommy
it hurts.

03:10.333 --> 03:11.700
Alyson: See, what
I don't understand

03:11.700 --> 03:13.733
is why people are just not
born with teeth?

03:13.733 --> 03:14.566
Exactly!

03:14.566 --> 03:15.633
Isn't that what I said?

03:15.633 --> 03:17.700
Oh my god,
I just talked about this.

03:17.700 --> 03:19.200
Judith: It's like gnawing away.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.700
Judith: Is he still biting you?

03:20.700 --> 03:23.533
Marie: Yeah.
Judith: Wow, you poor thing.

03:23.533 --> 03:24.400
Are you pacifying?

03:24.400 --> 03:25.500
Marie: Yes.

03:25.500 --> 03:28.033
Marie's mother
is completely pro-pacifier.

03:28.033 --> 03:32.266
Ah, so that makes her
a pacifist.

03:32.266 --> 03:33.700
Judith: Look, it's a
personal decision.

03:33.700 --> 03:35.666
I just believe babies
need an opportunity

03:35.666 --> 03:37.266
to practice self
soothing, you know?

03:37.266 --> 03:39.233
Pacifiers are unhygienic,
disgusting pieces of plastic.

03:39.233 --> 03:40.633
Alyson: See, I told you.

03:40.633 --> 03:42.200
Marie: I don't know
about that.

03:42.200 --> 03:44.366
Alyson: No, we've been having
this discussion all week.

03:44.366 --> 03:45.633
Judith: Really?
Alyson: Yeah.

03:45.633 --> 03:46.700
Alyson: I'm
onboard with you.

03:46.700 --> 03:48.266
(clears throat)

03:49.566 --> 03:51.666
Vegan nanaimo bar?

03:51.666 --> 03:53.666
Mmm, just a water.

03:53.666 --> 03:55.733
Just an excuse,
actually.

03:55.733 --> 03:56.633
Tired?

03:56.633 --> 03:58.033
Yup.

03:58.033 --> 04:00.100
Just got back from 92
the other day.

04:00.100 --> 04:01.566
The air was cleaner there.

04:01.566 --> 04:05.266
It's a real adjustment.

04:05.266 --> 04:08.400
Wow, you really don't wanna
talk about the therapy, do you?

04:11.066 --> 04:13.433
Let's talk about your friend,
the one who's ignoring you.

04:13.433 --> 04:15.533
Yeah, that's my
best friend.

04:15.533 --> 04:18.399
And she used to be
terrified of kids.

04:18.399 --> 04:21.399
Ah, things change,
apparently.

04:21.399 --> 04:23.200
Yup, but I mean,
it's good.

04:23.200 --> 04:24.600
I'm happy for her.

04:24.600 --> 04:26.133
(smug laugh)

04:26.133 --> 04:27.533
Yeah, right.

04:27.533 --> 04:29.066
What? I am.

04:29.066 --> 04:32.233
No, you're not
and I don't blame you.

04:32.233 --> 04:34.300
Kids come along,
people forget who they are.

04:34.300 --> 04:36.066
Their friends.

04:36.066 --> 04:37.700
A lot of marriages
don't survive kids,

04:37.700 --> 04:39.400
I bet even more
friendships don't.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.700
Oh really,
and how would you know?

04:41.700 --> 04:45.066
You look like you're
barely out of high school.

04:45.066 --> 04:47.000
Thanks for the water.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.233
Friendships
like everything else,

04:48.233 --> 04:50.233
are not immune to change.

04:50.233 --> 04:51.566
The question is:

04:51.566 --> 04:53.766
How do you keep
a friendship together

04:53.766 --> 04:55.733
when your lives
are pulling you apart?

04:55.733 --> 04:58.566

05:05.566 --> 05:08.433

Judith: Oh, sorry if I got
sucked into the whole mom vortex

05:38.700 --> 05:39.766
back there.

05:39.766 --> 05:41.300
It's okay.

05:41.300 --> 05:42.633
You were telling me
about Ethan?

05:42.633 --> 05:44.366
Yeah, it's just
all the little things

05:44.366 --> 05:46.066
that are starting to add up.

05:46.066 --> 05:47.366
Yeah,
tell me about it.

05:47.366 --> 05:50.133
Like when I'm trying to remind
Anthony to bring the diaper bag

05:50.133 --> 05:50.766
every single day.

05:50.766 --> 05:52.033
Uh, I guess...

05:52.033 --> 05:53.166
(cell phone rings)

05:53.166 --> 05:54.500
Oh, just a sec.

05:54.500 --> 05:56.466
Hey,
ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.

05:56.466 --> 05:58.033
What's up, hon?

05:58.033 --> 05:59.533
Well, my mom has a cold.

05:59.533 --> 06:01.533
She said she could
still make it though.

06:01.533 --> 06:04.033
No, uh, I don't want her
taking care of him

06:04.033 --> 06:05.433
if she's sick.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.633
I guess you could
stay home.

06:09.633 --> 06:13.366
No, I don't wanna
stay home. um...

06:13.366 --> 06:15.400
I'll figure it out, okay?

06:15.400 --> 06:17.466
Anthony:
I'm sorry, all right?

06:17.466 --> 06:19.066
See you tonight.

06:19.066 --> 06:20.733
What's going on?

06:20.733 --> 06:23.666
Oh, Anthony's giving a speech
at this diversity dinner

06:23.666 --> 06:26.566
for the bank in, like,
ooh, four hours?

06:26.566 --> 06:29.033
And I just lost the only
baby-sitter that I trust.

06:29.033 --> 06:30.700
Oh.

06:30.700 --> 06:33.400
Well,
why don't I just do it?

06:35.033 --> 06:36.566
Well...

06:36.566 --> 06:39.366
It's sweet of you to offer,
it's just that he's teething

06:39.366 --> 06:41.066
and being really difficult.

06:41.066 --> 06:43.533
Jude, I used to baby-sit
all the time.

06:43.533 --> 06:44.600
I can handle it.

06:46.100 --> 06:48.233
Unless you don't...

06:48.233 --> 06:49.633
I mean,
unless you don't trust me?

06:49.633 --> 06:50.700
No.

06:50.700 --> 06:52.266
No, it's not that.

06:52.266 --> 06:55.100
I just, I'm really precise
about his schedule.

06:55.100 --> 06:56.366
Oh, I know schedules,
lady.

06:56.366 --> 07:00.300
I've been taking the bus
since 1987.

07:00.300 --> 07:02.066
Can you make it for 6:30?

07:02.066 --> 07:04.300
I can be early
'cause I'm that good.

07:04.300 --> 07:06.566
You're awesome.

07:06.566 --> 07:07.300
Thank you.

07:10.400 --> 07:11.733
Really?

07:11.733 --> 07:14.566
How old is little Max,
Erica?

07:14.566 --> 07:17.266
Why will no one believe that
I'm an amazing baby-sitter?

07:17.266 --> 07:19.233
I used to baby-sit Sam.

07:19.233 --> 07:21.533
She was 8-years-old, honey.
Max is a baby.

07:21.533 --> 07:23.333
But I'm sure you'll do fine.

07:23.333 --> 07:25.433
Mmm,
very convincing, mom.

07:25.433 --> 07:26.666
(chuckles)

07:26.666 --> 07:28.133
Erica: Listen,
sorry about dinner.

07:28.133 --> 07:30.100
You're sure
it's not a problem?

07:30.100 --> 07:32.266
Not at all, honey.
I'll call you later.

07:32.266 --> 07:33.233
Erica:
Okay, bye.

07:33.233 --> 07:34.566
Sam:
Hey, mom.

07:34.566 --> 07:35.633
Hey!

07:35.633 --> 07:38.166
Errand day.

07:38.166 --> 07:39.500
Just dropping
your tupperware back.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.166
You could've kept those.
Muah.

07:41.166 --> 07:41.766
Ehn.

07:43.433 --> 07:45.166
What are you doing
for dinner tonight?

07:45.166 --> 07:46.166
Josh was gonna barbecue.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.266
Tell him to barbecue
tomorrow;

07:47.266 --> 07:49.466
I have an entire lasagna.

07:49.466 --> 07:52.633
We kinda have
a lot to do at home.

07:52.633 --> 07:54.500
So, we take the lasagna
to your house

07:54.500 --> 07:56.233
and maybe I can help out.

07:56.233 --> 07:58.033
Okay.

07:58.033 --> 07:59.400
I wasn't gonna say
anything yet,

07:59.400 --> 08:03.133
but we're moving
to London.

08:03.133 --> 08:06.200
Head office offered him
senior vp.

08:07.266 --> 08:08.633
Oh.

08:08.633 --> 08:09.733
Oh, Sam.

08:11.033 --> 08:12.533
London, England?

08:12.533 --> 08:15.066
This is good news, mom.

08:15.066 --> 08:17.166
Of course it is.

08:17.166 --> 08:19.400
It's just such a change.

08:21.066 --> 08:23.000
Oh, um...

08:23.000 --> 08:25.400
Well, what about your work?

08:25.400 --> 08:27.300
Well, they have hospitals
in London,

08:27.300 --> 08:29.033
and there are worse things

08:29.033 --> 08:31.466
than getting European
certification,

08:31.466 --> 08:33.633
and a couple of years
of overseas experience...

08:33.633 --> 08:36.233
A couple of years?

08:36.233 --> 08:38.299
Don't act all judgey
and Erica,

08:38.299 --> 08:40.666
and just be happy for us.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.500
Listen,
if this is what you want

08:45.500 --> 08:49.466
then of course I'm happy
for you, sweetheart.

08:49.466 --> 08:51.400
It's what we want.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.266
go in the microwave,

08:59.266 --> 09:00.266
it destroys the enzymes.

09:00.266 --> 09:02.266
Anthony: You waste
a drop of that stuff

09:02.266 --> 09:03.333
and she'll come
after you.

09:03.333 --> 09:05.333
Hi.

09:05.333 --> 09:07.100
I am all over it.

09:07.100 --> 09:09.466
Breast milk goes in warm water
until it's body temperature.

09:09.466 --> 09:11.000
That's impressive.
Thank you.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.500
I did research.
I'm prepared.

09:13.500 --> 09:15.733
Okay, bedtime is at seven
on the dot.

09:15.733 --> 09:17.733
Otherwise he gets overtired.

09:17.733 --> 09:19.466
Erica,
just keep him alive,

09:19.466 --> 09:21.066
everything else
is details, okay.

09:21.066 --> 09:22.066
I'm not joking, okay?

09:22.066 --> 09:24.300
If he gets tired,
he'll just rub his eyes

09:24.300 --> 09:26.066
and fuss so much
he can't sleep.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.600
Erica:
No, I know, I got it.

09:27.600 --> 09:28.700
Judith: Do you?

09:28.700 --> 09:31.066
Well, because if you don't,
he'll be off for days.

09:31.066 --> 09:32.366
And this matters
because it's just...

09:32.366 --> 09:33.433
Loud and clear, Judith.

09:33.433 --> 09:34.566
(car honks outside)

09:34.566 --> 09:36.100
There's the cab,
yup, gotta go, babe.

09:36.100 --> 09:37.366
Okay, um...

09:37.366 --> 09:39.566
Once you put him down,
do not pick him up, okay?

09:39.566 --> 09:41.400
I'm teaching him to self-soothe
without any props.

09:41.400 --> 09:42.633
Or no pacifiers,

09:42.633 --> 09:44.600
no rocking him to sleep
or anything like that.

09:44.600 --> 09:46.066
Okay, Judith,
research also says

09:46.066 --> 09:48.766
that at a certain point,
you have to stop being a mom

09:48.766 --> 09:50.500
and just go have fun.

09:50.500 --> 09:51.333
Judith: Okay.

09:51.333 --> 09:52.200
Anthony: Okay, Erica.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.233
Anthony: Thank you.

09:53.233 --> 09:55.233
Judith: Thanks.

09:55.233 --> 09:56.233
Erica:
Okay, have fun.

09:56.233 --> 09:57.333
(Max fusses)

10:01.233 --> 10:02.600
Crazy Aunt Erica,

10:02.600 --> 10:05.533
She's smarter
than your mommy thinks.

10:05.533 --> 10:07.266
Yes, she is.

10:07.266 --> 10:09.066
(telephone ringing)

10:09.066 --> 10:10.300
Hello?

10:10.300 --> 10:12.566
Erica: So, I just
called to let you know

10:12.566 --> 10:14.133
that we made it
'till bedtime.

10:14.133 --> 10:16.033
Without a single tear.

10:16.033 --> 10:17.233
Wonderful.

10:17.233 --> 10:18.566
Erica: And can I just
say for the record

10:18.566 --> 10:20.000
that snuggling a
warm baby,

10:20.000 --> 10:22.700
it's hardly the rough job
you mothers make it out to be.

10:22.700 --> 10:24.333
Uh-huh.

10:24.333 --> 10:26.400
So, Sam came over
and ate your lasagna.

10:26.400 --> 10:27.233
Is that Erica?

10:27.233 --> 10:28.633
Yes.

10:28.633 --> 10:30.333
Oh, Sam, sweetheart, can you
go downstairs to the basement

10:30.333 --> 10:31.633
and get some more
paper towel?

10:31.633 --> 10:34.100
Sam: Mhm.
Barbara: Thank you.

10:36.666 --> 10:39.500
They're moving to London.

10:39.500 --> 10:40.433
What, really?

10:40.433 --> 10:42.466
Sam?

10:42.466 --> 10:45.333
I mean, she could hardly
handle going to camp.

10:45.333 --> 10:47.766
Wow.
Well, good for her.

10:47.766 --> 10:50.266
Mm, it's for Josh,
a promotion.

10:50.266 --> 10:52.433
Ah, big surprise.

10:52.433 --> 10:55.066
She's acting excited,
but...

10:55.066 --> 10:57.233
I don't think
she's that into it.

10:57.233 --> 10:58.600
Uh, well,
then talk to her.

10:58.600 --> 11:00.600
I mean, mom,
if you're worried?

11:00.600 --> 11:02.633
Oh, you know how
defensive Sam can get.

11:02.633 --> 11:03.466
Do I...

11:03.466 --> 11:05.600
Shh-shh-shh.

11:05.600 --> 11:07.700
This is the thing,
you are her mother

11:07.700 --> 11:10.500
and your real opinion,
it matters to her.

11:10.500 --> 11:12.366
If you think this
is the wrong decision

11:12.366 --> 11:15.466
then you need
to speak up.

11:15.466 --> 11:16.500
Oh, oh, oh...

11:16.500 --> 11:19.066
Mom, it's Max's bedtime,
I gotta go.

11:19.066 --> 11:21.300
Of course, sweetheart,
I'll call you later, okay?

11:21.300 --> 11:22.733
Okay, bye.

11:22.733 --> 11:23.700
Say, bye.

11:25.333 --> 11:26.500
(telephone beeps off)

11:28.000 --> 11:30.166
It's time for bed.

11:30.166 --> 11:33.000
It's time for bed,
yes, sir, mister.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.333
Mmmm...

11:35.333 --> 11:37.033
(gasps)

11:37.033 --> 11:37.600
There you go.

11:39.266 --> 11:40.633
Don't tell mom it's
7:10, okay?

11:40.633 --> 11:43.500
That's between you and I.

11:43.500 --> 11:45.200
Good nightie-night
night-night-night.

11:45.200 --> 11:46.566
(Max fusses and cries)

11:50.300 --> 11:51.433
(Max cries)

11:58.033 --> 12:00.000
No, Erica.

12:01.500 --> 12:02.566
(sympathetic groan)

12:02.566 --> 12:03.300
(Max wails)

12:10.233 --> 12:12.400
Shhh, shhh, it's okay.

12:12.400 --> 12:14.300
(Max wails)

12:16.100 --> 12:17.366
Oh...

12:18.433 --> 12:20.266
Max, you're breaking
my heart.

12:20.266 --> 12:21.600
(Max cries)

12:21.600 --> 12:22.466
(sighs)

12:25.566 --> 12:27.233
Okay.

12:27.233 --> 12:29.133
Oh-oh-oh-oh.

12:29.133 --> 12:32.200
(makes comforting
playful sounds)

12:32.200 --> 12:33.133
(kisses)

12:35.100 --> 12:37.000
That's better.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.766
Oh. come and hang with
auntie Erica a little longer.

12:39.766 --> 12:41.600
Yeah.

12:41.600 --> 12:43.600
Yeah.

12:43.600 --> 12:44.700
Don't tell mom.

12:44.700 --> 12:47.266
Anthony: I'd like to thank
you all for coming,

12:47.266 --> 12:49.133
and for your continued
commitment

12:49.133 --> 12:50.433
to promoting diversity

12:50.433 --> 12:53.100
in the TD Canada Trust
workplace.

12:53.100 --> 12:54.000
Enjoy your evening.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.066
(guests applaud)

12:58.266 --> 13:00.000
Judith: Oh, just some
sparkling water, please?

13:00.000 --> 13:01.566
Woman 1: No, Kellar's
a perfect fit.

13:01.566 --> 13:03.600
Thank you so much
for recommending me.

13:03.600 --> 13:05.133
Judith: Oh, you're working
for Kellar Andrews?

13:05.133 --> 13:06.400
I used to be there.

13:06.400 --> 13:07.433
Woman 2:
Oh, really?

13:07.433 --> 13:08.566
Where are you now?

13:08.566 --> 13:10.466
Insomnia and droolstein.

13:11.500 --> 13:14.300
It's a... it was a joke.

13:14.300 --> 13:15.433
I'm on mat leave.

13:15.433 --> 13:16.600
Oh, great.

13:16.600 --> 13:17.533
Great.

13:19.366 --> 13:21.700
So, uh, how are things
with the Stohn action?

13:21.700 --> 13:23.633
Oh, they settled that
about two months ago.

13:23.633 --> 13:25.266
Do you know about
the Crosby lawsuit?

13:25.266 --> 13:26.633
Crosby?
Doesn't ring a bell.

13:26.633 --> 13:30.633
Really?
It's all over the news.

13:30.633 --> 13:34.500
Oh, well, maybe I should pick
up a paper once in a while.

13:34.500 --> 13:36.100
Then find time to read it.

13:36.100 --> 13:38.033
(polite laughter)

13:39.533 --> 13:41.533
I thought your firm
won Crosby at trial.

13:41.533 --> 13:44.333
Woman 2: We did, but then
we lost on the appeal.

13:44.333 --> 13:45.666
Who was the judge
on that?

13:45.666 --> 13:47.100
Ugh, Kelly,
he was so difficult.

13:47.100 --> 13:48.000
I know, surprising.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.266
Excuse me.

13:49.266 --> 13:50.533
I thought you would've
really--

13:50.533 --> 13:52.500
(makes playful sounds)

13:52.500 --> 13:53.666
(telephone rings)

13:55.300 --> 13:56.266
Oh.

13:57.433 --> 13:59.633
Hello, Judith,
everything is fine.

13:59.633 --> 14:01.266
Oh, thank you.

14:01.266 --> 14:03.300
That is such a relief,
I cannot tell you.

14:03.300 --> 14:05.133
So are you rocking it out?

14:05.133 --> 14:07.000
Oh, yeah, you know it.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.266
(Erica chuckles,
Max coos)

14:09.266 --> 14:10.333
Is that Max?

14:10.333 --> 14:11.466
Erica: Uh, yeah,
everything's fine.

14:11.466 --> 14:13.500
He just needed a little
more tiring out.

14:13.500 --> 14:15.000
It's almost eight, Erica.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.366
I told you to put him
to bed at seven.

14:17.366 --> 14:19.333
I know, Jude,
but he was crying.

14:19.333 --> 14:22.533
Of course he was crying,
he's a baby.

14:22.533 --> 14:24.666
Why is it always, always
so hard for you

14:24.666 --> 14:26.166
just to follow through,
huh?

14:26.166 --> 14:27.433
Look, Judith,
just calm down.

14:27.433 --> 14:30.200
Judith: If you can't even
follow a simple rule, I mean,

14:30.200 --> 14:31.500
what if something serious
would've happened?

14:31.500 --> 14:33.400
If I'm such a risk
to your child,

14:33.400 --> 14:34.533
then maybe you should
come home.

14:34.533 --> 14:36.033
I'll be there
in 20 minutes.

14:36.033 --> 14:37.766
(stammers, stunned)

14:39.166 --> 14:40.166
(beeps cell phone off)

14:40.166 --> 14:41.700
We have to go
straight to bed

14:41.700 --> 14:45.500
because your mother
has clearly lost her mind.

14:45.500 --> 14:46.400
Yeah.

14:47.633 --> 14:49.066
Oh, I know, Max.

14:53.433 --> 14:55.666
Okay, cave people
raised babies,

14:55.666 --> 14:58.600
so what if her kid's
a few minutes late for bed?

14:58.600 --> 15:01.166
It's not, it's not like
he can tell time.

15:01.166 --> 15:03.200
No, but you can.

15:03.200 --> 15:05.533
You were supposed to put him
down by seven, right?

15:05.533 --> 15:07.233
Um, whose side are you on?

15:07.233 --> 15:09.233
Mm, just the side
that makes me wonder:

15:09.233 --> 15:11.300
Is this really about
your friend's parenting style?

15:11.300 --> 15:12.666
Or is this about
something more?

15:12.666 --> 15:15.366
You know, right now is really
not the best moment

15:15.366 --> 15:17.733
with Max being here,
but we do need to talk.

15:17.733 --> 15:19.066
Hmm.

15:19.066 --> 15:19.700
What about?

15:19.700 --> 15:20.733
Kai?

15:20.733 --> 15:22.200
Kai.

15:22.200 --> 15:24.600
He's a patient, like me.

15:24.600 --> 15:26.300
May I?

15:26.300 --> 15:27.200
Knock yourself out.

15:27.200 --> 15:28.133
Oh, hello.

15:29.766 --> 15:32.066
Kai is going through
what I am.

15:32.066 --> 15:36.700
I finally met someone who's
doing the same thing and...

15:36.700 --> 15:38.766
He doesn't wanna talk
about it.

15:38.766 --> 15:41.700
I mean, isn't that weird?

15:41.700 --> 15:43.733
Erica, I'm not here
to gossip with you

15:43.733 --> 15:44.766
about other patients.

15:44.766 --> 15:47.033
In here,
we talk about you.

15:47.033 --> 15:49.166
That's it.

15:49.166 --> 15:52.766
So, third regret
from the bottom.

15:52.766 --> 15:53.766
Oh.

15:56.200 --> 15:57.566
Can we just talk about Kai?

15:57.566 --> 15:58.666
No.

15:58.666 --> 16:01.266
Tell me about frosh week.

16:02.600 --> 16:04.466
It was my second year,

16:04.466 --> 16:07.000
and I just moved in
with Ethan to a house

16:07.000 --> 16:08.100
with some other students,

16:08.100 --> 16:09.233
off campus.

16:10.533 --> 16:12.600
And Judith
and I were frosh leaders.

16:12.600 --> 16:14.533
At least,
we were supposed to be.

16:14.533 --> 16:17.033
At the end of first year
I signed us up

16:17.033 --> 16:18.600
and Judith,
she didn't even want to,

16:18.600 --> 16:24.333
but... I insisted
and then I bailed.

16:24.333 --> 16:26.733
See, I'd spent the summer

16:26.733 --> 16:29.133
reading women's theory

16:29.133 --> 16:31.500
and by the time
frosh week came,

16:31.500 --> 16:34.166
I really wanted to commit
myself to women's issues,

16:34.166 --> 16:37.666
so I whipped off my shirt
and marched around campus

16:37.666 --> 16:41.233
until I got
a major sunburn on...

16:41.233 --> 16:43.400
Much more dignified
than frosh week.

16:43.400 --> 16:46.733
Well, hey, if men can take their
shirts off on a hot day, then...

16:46.733 --> 16:48.200
I know.

16:48.200 --> 16:50.600
But it seemed to matter
at the time, it really did.

16:50.600 --> 16:53.166
And Judith?

16:53.166 --> 16:56.133
Erica: I left jude to manage
a massive group of frosh.

16:56.133 --> 16:57.166
Single-handed.

16:57.166 --> 16:59.700
30 kids away from home
for the first time,

16:59.700 --> 17:04.366
just drunk on freedom
and god knows what else.

17:04.366 --> 17:06.633
But good ol' Jude
she stuck it out

17:06.633 --> 17:07.766
even after I bailed.

17:09.500 --> 17:12.300
And she hated
every second of it.

17:15.033 --> 17:18.333
Ever since then there's been
this dynamic between us.

17:18.333 --> 17:21.366
Where she's the grown up
and I'm the flake.

17:21.366 --> 17:25.433
I can't even be trusted to
watch her son for a few hours.

17:25.433 --> 17:27.300
We're supposed to be
best friends, Dr. Tom,

17:27.300 --> 17:30.433
but I never see her anymore.

17:30.433 --> 17:33.000
Our friendship,
it's on life support.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.666
Well, sounds like
you should go back

17:34.666 --> 17:36.433
and resuscitate it.

17:39.466 --> 17:41.033
Judith:
This is what you do!

17:41.033 --> 17:42.333
I didn't know
it was possible

17:42.333 --> 17:43.666
to be this juvenile!

17:43.666 --> 17:46.200
I mean, you just follow
every whim and every--

17:46.200 --> 17:47.466
No-no-no-no, Judith,
Judith, it's okay,

17:47.466 --> 17:49.400
just take a deep breath,
okay?

17:49.400 --> 17:52.200
'cause I'm not doing feminist
frosh week anymore.

17:52.200 --> 17:53.333
I am staying with you.

17:53.333 --> 17:54.166
(Max cries)

17:58.033 --> 17:59.200
What is that?

17:59.200 --> 18:01.000
(Max whines loudly)

18:01.000 --> 18:01.600
Uh...

18:10.666 --> 18:12.233
Uh...

18:12.233 --> 18:14.733
Is this some kind
of frosh week hazing joke?

18:14.733 --> 18:16.533
You know,
I am not laughing.

18:16.533 --> 18:18.333
Trust me,
I am not either.

18:18.333 --> 18:20.500
Why are you baby-sitting
some kid?

18:20.500 --> 18:22.700
I'm baby-sitting.
Yes, I am!

18:22.700 --> 18:25.233
So, Judith,
meet little Max.

18:25.233 --> 18:26.333
Isn't he a cutie-pie?

18:26.333 --> 18:29.400
Mm. so you bail on doing
frosh week with me,

18:29.400 --> 18:31.700
but then one of your
girl power buddies needs help

18:31.700 --> 18:33.400
and you're all,
"Hey, no problem"!

18:33.400 --> 18:35.400
No-no-no, I'm not bailing
on you, okay, Judith.

18:35.400 --> 18:37.200
Change of plans;
I am there for you.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.533
And so is Max.

18:38.533 --> 18:40.300
I am steady as a rock.

18:40.300 --> 18:42.600
I just need five minutes
to go, um...

18:42.600 --> 18:45.166

If you could just...

18:45.166 --> 18:48.400
Hold him and then

22:43.733 --> 22:46.033
Well, I'm not sure

23:54.300 --> 23:56.733
Scottie: No kidding,
shouldn't he be in bed?

23:56.733 --> 23:59.166
Hey, buddy, you're in
the "best ass competition".

23:59.166 --> 24:01.200
Maybe you shouldn't be
passing judgment.

24:03.166 --> 24:04.133
Girl: Woooo-oo!

24:04.133 --> 24:05.033

24:05.033 --> 24:06.700
I think that he's teething
and he's tired.

24:06.700 --> 24:09.666
I have to take him to bed.
Jude, I'm so sorry.

24:09.666 --> 24:11.733
Look, was it my idea
to be frosh leaders?

24:11.733 --> 24:13.533
No, okay,
I did this for you.

24:13.533 --> 24:14.533
And despite that,

24:14.533 --> 24:16.766
I held the bag all day
at the carwash, okay.

24:16.766 --> 24:19.033
This, I told you
this is so stupid!

24:19.033 --> 24:20.633
I know, and I'm sorry,
but I...

24:20.633 --> 24:23.400
I mean, how was I supposed
to leave him at home?

24:23.400 --> 24:24.633
You could've gotten
a baby-sitter.

24:24.633 --> 24:25.633
I am the baby-sitter!

24:25.633 --> 24:28.033

to his mom, okay?

too, and just be back.

that needs to go to bed

24:43.366 --> 24:46.133
and you yelling at me is not
making the situation better,

24:46.133 --> 24:47.733

not helping him.

If the kid isn't
gone by tomorrow,

26:09.400 --> 26:10.500
then I am.

26:10.500 --> 26:13.766
Because I don't think
he pays rent.

26:13.766 --> 26:15.233
shhh.

26:15.233 --> 26:17.133
Oh, Ethan.

26:17.133 --> 26:19.666
Ethan,
thank you so much.

26:19.666 --> 26:21.433
Thank you for being
there for me.

26:21.433 --> 26:23.266
Uh, Erica,
look, I wanna help,

26:23.266 --> 26:26.133
but I'm so loaded right now,
I can barely stand.

26:26.133 --> 26:27.166
Please.

26:27.166 --> 26:28.533
I can't take care
of a baby.

26:28.533 --> 26:29.500
I'm sorry.

26:29.500 --> 26:31.300
Please.

26:32.633 --> 26:33.700
Shhh.

26:33.700 --> 26:35.733
No-no-no, it's okay.

26:35.733 --> 26:37.333
(mimics whirring)

26:41.633 --> 26:42.500
(birds chirp)

26:43.733 --> 26:44.766
Vroom!

26:44.766 --> 26:47.133
Bounce, bounce.

26:47.133 --> 26:48.733
Shh-shh.
Vroom.

26:48.733 --> 26:49.766
Please, Max.

26:49.766 --> 26:51.200
Bounce, bounce.

26:51.200 --> 26:53.266
Judith: Do you have any idea
what I've been doing all night?!

26:53.266 --> 26:55.100
Shh-shh, vroom.

26:55.100 --> 26:56.366
Bounce, bounce.

26:56.366 --> 26:58.133
Whoa, Erica, stop.

26:58.133 --> 27:00.466
Shh-shh,
vroom.

27:00.466 --> 27:01.333
What's wrong?

27:01.333 --> 27:02.466
Is something wrong with Max?

27:02.466 --> 27:03.666
Vroo- yup.

27:03.666 --> 27:05.600
No-no, if I don't do
the "bounce-bounce-shh-shh"

27:05.600 --> 27:09.100
and pat his bum
on every third, "vroom".

27:09.100 --> 27:10.233
If I don't...

27:10.233 --> 27:12.166
(Max cries)

27:12.166 --> 27:14.300
I know.
Whoa, whoa.

27:14.300 --> 27:17.033
You know what?
Enough, okay?

27:17.033 --> 27:18.566
You cannot go on
like this.

27:18.566 --> 27:20.266
I'm calling a cab.

27:20.266 --> 27:21.566
Cabs don't have
baby seats.

27:21.566 --> 27:24.033
That is the least
of your problems.

27:24.033 --> 27:27.200
(Erica repeats calming mantra
while Max cries wildly)

27:28.666 --> 27:30.666
(inhales and exhales)

27:33.566 --> 27:34.300
(Max cries)

27:37.033 --> 27:39.433
Erica: shh-shh-shh-shh,
shush-shush-shush.

27:39.433 --> 27:42.600
Where are we going?

27:42.600 --> 27:45.333
Your mom's.

27:45.333 --> 27:48.766
She'll know what
to do with you.

27:48.766 --> 27:50.500
Frosh week this time
last year,

27:50.500 --> 27:52.466
we were having
so much fun.

27:52.466 --> 27:53.700
Yes we were.

27:55.233 --> 27:57.000
Do you remember driving
into the fountain

27:57.000 --> 27:59.433
and then the cops
chasing us?

27:59.433 --> 28:00.433
Yup.

28:03.266 --> 28:06.300
So, how within a year

28:06.300 --> 28:09.333
could you dump me
for your feminist friends?

28:09.333 --> 28:11.300
I don't get it.

28:11.300 --> 28:13.300
Jude, I didn't dump you.

28:13.300 --> 28:16.533
Yes, you did, actually.

28:16.533 --> 28:19.500
Whatever, that seems to be
your specialty these days.

28:19.500 --> 28:20.333
Judith.

28:20.333 --> 28:22.366
Look, it is what it is,
you know?

28:22.366 --> 28:23.666
I just wish
I could understand

28:23.666 --> 28:25.366
why this woman
and her baby

28:25.366 --> 28:27.400
seem to be more important
to you than me.

28:27.400 --> 28:29.033
It's not that.
Yeah, it is!

28:29.033 --> 28:30.066
It's like...

28:30.066 --> 28:32.066
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

28:32.066 --> 28:33.266
Oh, come on!

28:33.266 --> 28:35.033
I am still the same person,
okay?

28:35.033 --> 28:37.400
I'm just trying to deal
with this situation.

28:37.400 --> 28:40.200
I know, I know, baby,
you just need sleep.

28:40.200 --> 28:43.500
What you need, Max,
is to go home.

28:43.500 --> 28:46.000
And what I need is some
patience and support.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.266
Oh god, here we go!

28:47.266 --> 28:49.366
Why does everyone act like
taking care of children

28:49.366 --> 28:50.700
is the hardest thing ever?

28:50.700 --> 28:51.533
(chuckles)

28:51.533 --> 28:52.600
Because you know what?

28:52.600 --> 28:53.766
It is.

28:53.766 --> 28:55.566
And you have no idea
what you're talking about.

28:55.566 --> 28:56.433
Wait. you know what?

28:56.433 --> 28:57.466
Judith, wait--

28:57.466 --> 28:59.066
Wait until you
have a baby.

28:59.066 --> 29:02.200
Yeah, fat chance,
me having a kid after today.

29:03.633 --> 29:04.566
Hmm.

29:09.033 --> 29:10.133
Samantha:
It's my hair.

29:10.133 --> 29:11.366
I know, honey.

29:11.366 --> 29:14.366
Stephanie says that Josh doesn't
get to tell me what to do with

29:14.366 --> 29:16.700
my hair and that I should
just cut it anyways.

29:16.700 --> 29:19.033
Well, Stephanie isn't Josh's
girlfriend, you are.

29:19.033 --> 29:21.000
A little lesson about men,

29:21.000 --> 29:23.300
they need to feel important.

29:23.300 --> 29:24.333
Stephanie says--

29:24.333 --> 29:26.366
I don't care what
Stephanie says,

29:26.366 --> 29:28.233
honey, it's just hair.

29:28.233 --> 29:31.566
When you love someone,
it's nice to make them happy.

29:31.566 --> 29:32.566
Erica?

29:32.566 --> 29:34.466
Hey, Sammy,
hey, Mom.

29:34.466 --> 29:38.300
What are you doing here
with a baby?

29:38.300 --> 29:41.366
I'm just baby-sitting
for a friend.

29:41.366 --> 29:42.366
Erica needs help.

29:42.366 --> 29:44.100
She needs some
experienced hands.

29:44.100 --> 29:47.233
Well,
I have a set of those.

29:47.233 --> 29:50.100
Come here little guy.

29:50.100 --> 29:51.066
Hello, handsome.

29:51.066 --> 29:52.000
Yes.

29:54.466 --> 29:56.166
Shhhh.

29:56.166 --> 29:57.500
Sleepy-sleepy-sleep.

29:57.500 --> 30:01.266
You're lucky the Salsberg's are
having a baby shower next week.

30:01.266 --> 30:04.166
I just pulled this out
of the gift basket

30:04.166 --> 30:06.333
and sterilized it,
and...

30:08.000 --> 30:09.633
Let the sleeping begin.

30:09.633 --> 30:11.633
His mom really doesn't
want me using those,

30:11.633 --> 30:13.133
I don't think
that we should.

30:13.133 --> 30:14.433
Did you turn out okay?

30:14.433 --> 30:16.633
'Cause you were hooked
on them.

30:16.633 --> 30:19.266
And I liked my sleep.

30:19.266 --> 30:21.466
Oh, god, so do I.

30:21.466 --> 30:23.300
I had no idea.

30:23.300 --> 30:24.500
I'm going to work.

30:24.500 --> 30:27.000
Promise me you'll call
the boy's mother.

30:27.000 --> 30:27.733
Today.

30:49.766 --> 30:51.266
Oh god.

30:52.533 --> 30:54.100
You want me to go in?

30:54.100 --> 30:55.300
No, no, it's fine,

30:55.300 --> 30:57.566
he's learning
to self-soothe.

30:57.566 --> 30:59.666
Thank you
for making me come here.

30:59.666 --> 31:02.400
Oh, who would leave
a crazy girl with a baby

31:02.400 --> 31:04.266
having a meltdown.

31:08.166 --> 31:11.400
See, we just need to give max
a few minutes to cool down.

31:11.400 --> 31:14.200
Oh, yeah, you needed
to give him a pacifier.

31:14.200 --> 31:16.100
Like, last night.

31:22.566 --> 31:24.366
You know,
this is the first time

31:24.366 --> 31:27.100
we've been alone together
since...

31:27.100 --> 31:29.033
Probably, last spring.

31:29.033 --> 31:30.233
What?

31:30.233 --> 31:31.233
No, that's not possible.

31:31.233 --> 31:33.733
Yeah, think about it.

31:33.733 --> 31:36.233
Back in high school,
we used to spend...

31:36.233 --> 31:38.466
Sometimes days together.

31:40.233 --> 31:41.566
Trust me,
ten years from now,

31:41.566 --> 31:43.366
we are still gonna
be hanging out

31:43.366 --> 31:45.200
and we're gonna laugh
at this time.

31:45.200 --> 31:47.233
You don't know that.

31:47.233 --> 31:48.633
What if we hit 30

31:48.633 --> 31:51.200
and you're, like,
some famous author

31:51.200 --> 31:53.733
and don't have anything
in common anymore?

31:53.733 --> 31:55.266
Not gonna happen.

31:55.266 --> 31:56.766
How do you know,
for sure?

31:56.766 --> 31:59.333
Because you're one of the most
important people in the world

31:59.333 --> 32:00.333
to me.

32:02.400 --> 32:04.400
You're my best friend.

32:11.366 --> 32:12.366
(laugh)

32:21.000 --> 32:22.033
(knock on door)

32:28.100 --> 32:30.566
Finally.

32:30.566 --> 32:32.133
It's quiet in here.

32:32.133 --> 32:34.466
Yeah,
everybody's sleeping.

32:34.466 --> 32:36.700
Judith is crashed out
on the couch

32:36.700 --> 32:38.766
and Max is over here.

32:38.766 --> 32:40.333
Come and see.

32:42.333 --> 32:44.166
My mom is getting
the biggest

32:44.166 --> 32:46.166
mother's day gift ever
this year.

32:46.166 --> 32:48.166
Not as easy as it looks,
huh?

32:48.166 --> 32:50.300
Erica: The amount of havoc that
little person caused?

32:50.300 --> 32:53.166
Unreal,
I had no idea.

32:53.166 --> 32:54.566
Neither did Judith.

32:54.566 --> 32:57.566
She had to give birth
on top of it.

32:57.566 --> 33:00.000
To have your life change
so radically?

33:00.000 --> 33:01.166
It's bewildering.

33:01.166 --> 33:03.133
Everything she was good at:

33:03.133 --> 33:05.266
litigation,
case law,

33:05.266 --> 33:07.166
lunching with clients,

33:07.166 --> 33:08.400
gone.

33:08.400 --> 33:09.333
(Max whines)

33:09.333 --> 33:11.233
And instead, chaos.

33:14.433 --> 33:17.766
Beautiful chaos,
but chaos.

33:17.766 --> 33:19.433
So, tell me something?

33:19.433 --> 33:22.533
What did you need the most

33:22.533 --> 33:25.300
when you had a baby
attached to you every moment?

33:27.666 --> 33:29.300
For people to understand.

33:29.300 --> 33:33.500
You know, to give max and
I room to figure it out.

33:33.500 --> 33:35.233
"Friendship is born
at that moment

33:35.233 --> 33:37.100
when one person says
to another,

33:37.100 --> 33:38.666
"What, you too?"

33:38.666 --> 33:40.633
"I thought I was
the only one."

33:40.633 --> 33:41.733
C.S. Lewis.

33:47.100 --> 33:48.033
(exhales)

33:52.100 --> 33:53.333
(door clicks open)

33:56.066 --> 33:58.266
Hey, I was wrong
and I am sorry.

33:58.266 --> 33:59.733
The whole sleeping thing,

33:59.733 --> 34:02.100
it matters a lot.

34:02.100 --> 34:03.466
You were right.

34:07.100 --> 34:08.400
Thank you.

34:08.400 --> 34:10.566
I mean, I didn't try hard
enough to understand

34:10.566 --> 34:13.366
where you were coming from.

34:13.366 --> 34:16.233
Well, it's really hard
if you haven't been there.

34:16.233 --> 34:18.266
How babies get when
they're overtired.

34:18.266 --> 34:19.266
Oh, I know.
'cause...

34:19.266 --> 34:21.066
Because I was talking
to a friend

34:21.066 --> 34:22.433
and she was telling me
stories.

34:22.433 --> 34:24.433
The deep knee bends,
and blow dryers,

34:24.433 --> 34:26.199
and the crazy lengths
she went through

34:26.199 --> 34:28.199
to get her baby
to go to bed.

34:28.199 --> 34:30.699
Well, I've been there.

34:30.699 --> 34:31.433
I bet.

34:34.566 --> 34:36.266
Is he sleeping?

34:44.066 --> 34:46.633
Oh, I miss him.

34:46.633 --> 34:48.633
Whenever I'm away from him,
I just start thinking.

34:48.633 --> 34:49.566
Ohhh...

34:52.666 --> 34:54.566
Is that a pacifier?

34:54.566 --> 34:56.433
Erica: I know, but
he's sleeping.

34:56.433 --> 34:57.766
And he needed to sleep,
Jude,

34:57.766 --> 34:59.333
you said that yourself.

34:59.333 --> 35:03.300
I mean, it's just,
it's one pacifier.

35:03.300 --> 35:04.633
"Put him to bed at seven."

35:04.633 --> 35:06.300
"Don't give him a pacifier."

35:06.300 --> 35:09.366
These are not hard rules
to follow.

35:09.366 --> 35:11.400
But this, tonight,
is like, you know?

35:11.400 --> 35:14.000
It's like our whole friendship
on repeat for years.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.100
Yeah, and for years,

35:15.100 --> 35:17.066
I've been the screwed up
side-kick

35:17.066 --> 35:19.533
and you're perfect,
Judith winters.

35:19.533 --> 35:21.533
I mean, Jude,
people change.

35:21.533 --> 35:24.166
I'm not the same person
that I was

35:24.166 --> 35:27.333
and neither are you.
I am not a screw up

35:27.333 --> 35:30.700
and you most definitely
are not perfect.

35:34.166 --> 35:35.400
(breathes shakily)

35:37.700 --> 35:40.566
Erica: Thank you.
Keep the change.

35:40.566 --> 35:42.533
Dr. Tom:
Care to sit?

35:44.733 --> 35:47.266
Well, Kai was right.

35:47.266 --> 35:48.400
About what?

35:49.666 --> 35:50.666
(sighs heavily)

35:52.400 --> 35:54.133
Once your friends
have kids?

35:54.133 --> 35:56.600
You're on the way
to friend-divorce.

35:56.600 --> 35:58.666
Oh, well,
that would be a shame.

35:58.666 --> 36:01.166
You and Judith share
a lot of history.

36:01.166 --> 36:05.366
I tried to see where
she was coming from,

36:05.366 --> 36:07.266
to understand her
point of view,

36:09.133 --> 36:11.766
but it wasn't enough.

36:11.766 --> 36:14.133
And that's the trouble
with friendships.

36:14.133 --> 36:16.433
Each one
is a two-way street.

36:17.500 --> 36:20.166
What more can I do?

36:20.166 --> 36:21.333
You can wait.

36:23.300 --> 36:24.433
For what?

36:24.433 --> 36:25.666
(cell phone rings)

36:33.466 --> 36:34.466
(phone rings)

36:35.466 --> 36:37.133
(clears throat)

36:38.166 --> 36:39.100
Hello?

36:40.500 --> 36:42.100
Oh, hey, um...

36:44.066 --> 36:45.466
Can we meet up?

36:45.466 --> 36:46.633
Now?

36:46.633 --> 36:48.166
Judith:
Yeah.

36:48.166 --> 36:50.566
Goblins in 20 minutes?

36:50.566 --> 36:52.300
Please.

36:54.166 --> 36:57.066
Erica:
Sure, I'll see you there.

37:13.066 --> 37:14.400
Um, thank you.

37:14.400 --> 37:15.333
Thanks for dinner,
mom.

37:15.333 --> 37:16.433
Your welcome, sweety.

37:17.733 --> 37:19.200
Sam, wait.

37:22.200 --> 37:24.433
I've been where you are.

37:25.500 --> 37:27.566
In the foyer with lasagna?

37:29.033 --> 37:30.566
I lived your father's life.

37:30.566 --> 37:32.700
And then I lived for you

37:32.700 --> 37:34.733
and for Leo
and for Erica,

37:34.733 --> 37:36.266
never for myself.

37:37.433 --> 37:40.466
What are you talking about,
mom?

37:40.466 --> 37:43.266
Do you really want
to move to London?

37:43.266 --> 37:45.400
It's an amazing opportunity.

37:45.400 --> 37:47.133
For Josh.

37:47.133 --> 37:48.766
But what about you?

37:52.100 --> 37:53.666
Sam, look at me.

37:55.766 --> 37:59.066
I'm just trying to tell you
I know what you're doing

37:59.066 --> 38:00.733
and it's a mistake.

38:03.533 --> 38:04.633
I need to go.

38:04.633 --> 38:07.366
I needed to speak up,
Sam.

38:07.366 --> 38:09.666
And now you need to,
too.

38:14.200 --> 38:16.366
Thank you for dinner.

38:18.166 --> 38:19.100
Sam.

38:28.600 --> 38:30.266
(car door closes)

38:30.266 --> 38:31.500
(exhales emotionally)

38:35.266 --> 38:36.766
(sniffles)

38:36.766 --> 38:39.100
(inhales and exhales shakily)

38:43.633 --> 38:45.633
(inhales and whimpers)

38:45.633 --> 38:47.366
♪ I wanna know ♪

38:51.300 --> 38:53.433
♪ Just how you feel ♪

38:56.766 --> 38:58.766
♪ I wanna know ♪

38:58.766 --> 39:00.066
Thanks for coming here.

39:00.066 --> 39:01.500
Mm-hmm.

39:01.500 --> 39:04.100
I know it's late,
I just...

39:05.633 --> 39:09.033
After you left I started
thinking about what you said.

39:09.033 --> 39:10.566
How I acted and...

39:15.066 --> 39:17.600
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

39:17.600 --> 39:19.266
Jude, you have
a 4-month-old

39:19.266 --> 39:21.000
and you're tired,
and anxious

39:21.000 --> 39:24.066
and the learning curve,
it must be insane.

39:24.066 --> 39:26.566
This is harder
than law school.

39:26.566 --> 39:28.433
I, I can imagine.

39:30.266 --> 39:32.066
And, you know,
I'm trying to be supportive,

39:32.066 --> 39:33.566
but I miss you.

39:35.066 --> 39:36.166
I missed you too.

39:36.166 --> 39:38.500
Everyday there's so many things
that I wanna tell you.

39:38.500 --> 39:40.233
And I wanna hear them.

39:40.233 --> 39:41.400
I do.

39:41.400 --> 39:43.166
I know I got
distracted today,

39:43.166 --> 39:45.300
I do. I just...

39:45.300 --> 39:47.266
It's hard trying to...

39:47.266 --> 39:50.066
Figure out how to pay attention
to a million things at once.

39:50.066 --> 39:51.533
Oh god, I know.

39:55.633 --> 39:58.066
You were telling me
about Ethan.

39:58.066 --> 40:00.033
Oh, Ethan, he's great.

40:00.033 --> 40:02.066
I'm happy,

40:02.066 --> 40:04.400
confused and trying to figure
it all out of course, but...

40:04.400 --> 40:07.266
Basically I'm happy.

40:07.266 --> 40:08.466
And work?

40:09.766 --> 40:14.200
Um, Julianne and Friedken
are sleeping together.

40:16.533 --> 40:19.766
And I got the biggest
title of the year.

40:19.766 --> 40:20.700
No!

40:20.700 --> 40:22.533
I know, I know!
It's crazy, right?

40:22.533 --> 40:24.433
Oh my god,
yeah.

40:24.433 --> 40:27.233
Wow.

40:27.233 --> 40:30.166
Things really have changed,
haven't they?

40:30.166 --> 40:31.766
Yeah, they really have.

40:31.766 --> 40:33.433
For both of us.

40:36.233 --> 40:39.600
Can you handle some brutal
honesty right now?

40:39.600 --> 40:43.500
I never expect anything less
from you, Jude.

40:45.266 --> 40:47.733
I don't feel
like I'm that good

40:47.733 --> 40:50.400
at this whole mother thing.

40:51.733 --> 40:53.233
I'm just...

40:53.233 --> 40:56.700
I'm not used to feeling
like I suck at something.

40:56.700 --> 40:58.233
I know.

40:58.233 --> 41:01.633
And sometimes I really miss
being at work, you know?

41:01.633 --> 41:04.133
Everybody tells me I should
just love being at home,

41:04.133 --> 41:06.766
on mat leave...

41:06.766 --> 41:09.266
I can't tell Aly and Marie
how I'm feeling.

41:09.266 --> 41:12.433
I can't even tell Anthony.

41:12.433 --> 41:15.166
The only person I feel
like I can tell,

41:15.166 --> 41:16.333
is you.

41:24.500 --> 41:26.500
Do you remember those
crazy sex dreams

41:26.500 --> 41:29.233
I used to have about
Professor Lozar?

41:29.233 --> 41:31.333
Mm-hmm.

41:31.333 --> 41:33.566
Well,
sometimes I still have them.

41:33.566 --> 41:35.733
Really?

41:35.733 --> 41:37.233
And I would never
tell anyone.

41:37.233 --> 41:38.500
I can't tell Ethan.

41:38.500 --> 41:42.100
But I tell you because
we tell each other everything.

41:44.000 --> 41:44.533
Yeah.

41:46.700 --> 41:50.600
Erica, I am gonna,
I'm gonna try harder, okay?

41:50.600 --> 41:52.200
Okay.

41:52.200 --> 41:54.000
And I'm wanna make
time for you.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.133
I mean,
I'm gonna make time for you.

41:56.133 --> 41:59.033
I just, things get
so crazy sometimes.

41:59.033 --> 42:01.700
Jude, I get it.
And I'm not gonna get angry

42:01.700 --> 42:04.666
or resentful when you can't,
or you have to cancel.

42:04.666 --> 42:05.733
I promise.

42:07.433 --> 42:08.733
Okay.

42:08.733 --> 42:10.200
Thank you.

42:11.666 --> 42:12.666
I ordered wine.

42:12.666 --> 42:13.733
Okay.

42:13.733 --> 42:14.733
Erica:
When life pulls you apart,

42:14.733 --> 42:17.500
you have to work to stay
close together.

42:17.500 --> 42:19.633
By putting yourself
in each other's shoes,

42:19.633 --> 42:22.266
by reminding each other
of who you were

42:22.266 --> 42:24.400
and who you are becoming.

42:24.400 --> 42:27.766
By remembering that despite
all the changes that come,

42:27.766 --> 42:31.100
there are some things that
will always remain the same.
