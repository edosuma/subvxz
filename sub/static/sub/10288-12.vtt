I want a Russian/English dictionary
and I want it now.

14:51.257 --> 14:52.554
Right.

14:53.025 --> 14:56.461
Harry, peoples, would you excuse us?

14:57.363 --> 14:59.695
What, you mean
you're gonna take a look at her now?

15:00.867 --> 15:05.532
But Yakov, if it's not Sonya,
you will be undressing a total stranger.

REBECCA:
Be out in a minute.

Yea, though I walk through the valley

Okay, get me a beer.
I'm gonna watch the football game.

15:35.802 --> 15:39.204
Dan, the time for jokes is over.

Come. Come, take me now.

Oh, this is wrong. This is terrible.
I deserve to die.

16:13.172 --> 16:14.606
Problem?

16:16.809 --> 16:18.709
It's my husband.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.479
Your husband?

16:21.781 --> 16:24.182
You never said anything
about a husband.

16:24.350 --> 16:25.579
<i>He's</i> dead.

16:25.751 --> 16:27.185
Thank God.

16:27.353 --> 16:28.582
I killed him.

16:30.289 --> 16:32.087
Will you look at the time?

16:32.258 --> 16:34.920
This has been a fun evening,
but I really gotta go.

16:35.094 --> 16:38.394
He had a heart attack
while we were making love.

16:39.899 --> 16:42.561
Oh, I thought you meant
you took a gun and:

16:42.768 --> 16:48.002
I never realized until now
just how much I miss him.

16:50.409 --> 16:53.344
It was the last time I had sex.

16:56.616 --> 16:58.050
How long ago was this?

16:59.452 --> 17:02.149
1973.

17:03.289 --> 17:06.748
Good God,
you haven't had sex since Nixon?

17:08.627 --> 17:12.428
I probably thought about it though
every one of those days.

17:13.866 --> 17:18.326
Well, anyway, last week,
I just couldn't take it anymore.

17:18.503 --> 17:22.098
So I decided...

17:22.275 --> 17:24.242
...that I would permit myself...

17:24.410 --> 17:29.405
...one sleazy meaningless encounter
with a nondescript, morally bankrupt gigolo.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.072
Hey.

17:32.718 --> 17:35.653
Who are you calling nondescript?

18:05.184 --> 18:06.674
How long were you married?

18:08.788 --> 18:11.519
Thirty-five wonderful years.

18:11.691 --> 18:15.491
Thirty-five years?
My God, I've barely been alive that long.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.520
Thank you, I feel so much better now.

18:18.698 --> 18:19.859
No.

18:21.133 --> 18:23.192
What I meant was
that you hardly ever hear...

18:23.369 --> 18:25.838
...of anybody even staying together
that long anymore.

18:26.005 --> 18:28.599
Well, it's easy...

...when you have a loving, caring.
compassionate man.

18:35.881 --> 18:37.406
You see...

18:38.985 --> 18:44.890
...my husband made himself
a multimillionaire.

18:45.524 --> 18:51.896
So on our 25th anniversary,
he gave me a silver ring...

18:52.465 --> 18:55.400
...out of tinfoil from a gum wrapper.

18:56.569 --> 18:58.765
He built it himself.

18:59.305 --> 19:00.830
Took him three hours.

19:02.408 --> 19:05.241
He even made
the company board of directors...

19:05.411 --> 19:08.244
...wait on a meeting until he got it done.

19:10.016 --> 19:14.954
Well, when we got engaged,
he couldn't give me a ring.

19:15.254 --> 19:17.723
But he gave me one that he made...

19:17.890 --> 19:21.520
...just like this one, out of gum wrappers.

19:23.329 --> 19:25.730
And the card said:

19:25.898 --> 19:30.995
“Someday, I'll give you a real one.“

19:33.372 --> 19:37.866
And the card on this one said:

19:40.579 --> 19:43.048
“It worked the last time.

19:45.184 --> 19:49.018
I'm not gonna take any chances
with silver.“

19:52.958 --> 19:57.657
Sounds like you two had
what the rest of us are looking for.

19:58.831 --> 19:59.992
I'm envious.

20:02.835 --> 20:08.205
You know, when you let your vulnerable
side show, you have definite sex appeal.

- You're just saying that.
- Why would I say it it it weren't true?
