WEBVTT

00:10.040 --> 00:16.161
What's the matter?
What's the matter with you lately?

00:17.720 --> 00:23.841
What's the matter?
What's the matter with you lately?

00:25.240 --> 00:31.600
Oh, your love is never good enough

00:32.759 --> 00:37.368
Oh, your love is lost on me

00:39.160 --> 00:40.924
Rest of the place is clear.

00:41.120 --> 00:44.329
Yeah. Uh, no ID on this one. Um...

00:44.520 --> 00:49.048
And no clue
who is painted on the walls.

00:49.400 --> 00:51.448
Whatever happened,
looks like we missed it.

00:51.600 --> 00:54.080
Yeah. Great.

00:55.280 --> 00:56.930
Wait a second.

00:59.280 --> 01:00.930
What the hell?

01:22.640 --> 01:26.167
Never good enough

01:27.080 --> 01:28.241
Hey, Christopher Nolan.

01:28.440 --> 01:29.726
- Yeah.
- Lens cap.

01:29.880 --> 01:32.121
Oh, crap. Yeah.

01:32.360 --> 01:34.567
Strong work, genius.

01:34.720 --> 01:37.041
I have no idea
what to make this movie about.

01:37.240 --> 01:41.450
I'm, like... I'm AV Club president.
So, you know, it's gotta be good.

01:41.600 --> 01:43.568
Here. Give me that.

01:44.080 --> 01:46.242
- I'll tell you what your movie's about.
- Okay.

01:46.480 --> 01:50.087
- In a world where nothing is what it seems...
- Ha-ha-ha.

01:50.240 --> 01:53.483
...one brave, shockingly handsome...

01:53.640 --> 01:57.850
...virile young man,
and his faithful, learning-disabled...

01:58.000 --> 02:00.002
- Oh, no.
- ...robotic manservant...

02:00.160 --> 02:04.484
...must battle through waves
of cybernetic asshats...

02:04.680 --> 02:09.241
- ...to sexually liberate the women of... Heh, heh.
- Okay, give me that. Give me that.

02:12.480 --> 02:15.962
Oh, please. I bet at least one
of these girls would let you partake...

02:16.120 --> 02:17.929
...in awkward guy experimental phase.

02:18.080 --> 02:20.367
What? These girls?

02:20.520 --> 02:21.681
- Yeah.
- Okay.

02:21.880 --> 02:23.928
Hashtag: Fails.

02:24.120 --> 02:25.849
Home schooled.

02:26.040 --> 02:28.611
Secretly in love with her roommate.

02:28.840 --> 02:31.525
Listens to country music.

02:31.680 --> 02:34.604
Oh, dude. Dude, 12 o'clock.

02:34.760 --> 02:36.444
- Yeah.
- Wait, is she...? Crap.

02:36.600 --> 02:39.046
- Dude, here, take it.
- I'm not gonna take it.

02:39.800 --> 02:43.043
- Were you just filming me?
- No. I wouldn't do that.

02:43.920 --> 02:46.127
Does that have the new firmware?

02:46.320 --> 02:48.561
Uh, yes. Yes, it does.

02:48.720 --> 02:49.846
How does it handle?

02:50.000 --> 02:51.843
You tell me.

02:54.160 --> 02:57.209
Oh, well, your settings are way off.

02:57.440 --> 03:00.410
I like the way the colors...
You probably don't care about that.

03:00.560 --> 03:02.244
So you weren't checking me out?

03:02.920 --> 03:06.720
Well, I do have a thing for beautiful
women who respect their privacy.

03:09.320 --> 03:11.084
Dick move on my part. I'm sorry.

03:11.240 --> 03:12.730
Don't be.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.167
I have a thing for guys
with cool cameras.

03:49.960 --> 03:52.281
No, no, no. Look, it's a great movie.

03:52.480 --> 03:57.771
But of the two, I prefer
Last Year at Marienbad, you know?

03:58.000 --> 04:00.606
Yeah. It's a classic.

04:01.240 --> 04:04.369
- How do you like that lens?
- It's good. Yeah, yeah.

04:04.520 --> 04:06.966
- It's lighter for sure.
- That's good.

04:07.120 --> 04:11.045
You know, Michael knows nothing
about cameras, right?

04:11.200 --> 04:15.046
Yeah. But I'm teaching him.

04:15.880 --> 04:18.486
- Teaching who?
- Oh, my boyfriend.

04:18.640 --> 04:22.565
- He's big, tall and handsome.
- Mm.

04:22.720 --> 04:25.087
- Sounds delish.
- You should totally meet him.

04:25.280 --> 04:26.770
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

04:29.120 --> 04:32.442
Let's see. Five years from now?

04:32.640 --> 04:37.806
Hopefully passed the bar exam.
Practicing law.

04:38.080 --> 04:39.491
Nothing corporate.

04:39.640 --> 04:41.449
Something, uh...

04:41.600 --> 04:46.288
- Something green, you know?
- Green is good.

04:46.440 --> 04:48.966
- Hippie. Ha-ha-ha.
- Shut up.

04:49.120 --> 04:51.009
Oh, jeez. Uh...

04:51.160 --> 04:53.162
Maybe, like, working for HBO.

04:53.320 --> 04:55.322
Or, like, Michael Moore.

04:55.560 --> 04:57.847
- That'd be cool.
- Double hippie.

04:59.560 --> 05:00.641
Whatever.

05:00.800 --> 05:03.087
I will be on a boat
in the middle of the ocean.

05:03.280 --> 05:06.409
- My beautiful girl by my side.
- Aw...

05:06.560 --> 05:08.369
- Sap.
- And you can come too.

05:09.720 --> 05:12.200
Nice. See what you just did there?
Ha-ha-ha.

05:15.840 --> 05:19.481
Display of that, let's make sure
we put our hand up first next time.

05:19.640 --> 05:21.881
All right,
let's get our pens and pencils out.

05:22.080 --> 05:23.809
It's time for notes.

05:23.960 --> 05:28.010
So let's turn our attention
to our cruelly nicknamed friend, Piggy.

05:28.160 --> 05:31.369
He uses his glasses to create fire,
sundial.

05:31.520 --> 05:34.808
He's also rational.
He inhabits rational thought.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.121
On the island.

05:36.280 --> 05:37.361
What'd I miss?

05:37.560 --> 05:40.040
Just another perfect lecture
from Professor Ludensky.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.361
Yeah.

05:41.520 --> 05:44.729
- You know Simon was a Christ figure?
- Yeah.

05:44.880 --> 05:47.326
No. Please tell me you taped it?

05:47.480 --> 05:48.686
Come on. Who loves you?

05:48.840 --> 05:51.969
- Aw, I wish I could quit you. Ha-ha-ha.
- Yeah, right. Yeah.

05:52.160 --> 05:55.084
- Hey.
- Watch it, asshat.

05:55.240 --> 05:56.571
What'd you call me?

05:56.720 --> 05:58.006
Come on, let's move.

05:58.160 --> 05:59.844
I wanna see it.

06:02.400 --> 06:04.243
Oh, man.

06:05.640 --> 06:08.325
Hey. Can you shoot some
of this for my movie?

06:08.480 --> 06:11.211
- Is that legal?
- Who cares?

06:15.520 --> 06:18.171
- Yeah, that's not good.
- Someone got murdered on campus?

06:18.320 --> 06:20.846
You guys live two blocks
from here.

06:21.440 --> 06:23.761
Look, look, look. Starsky and Hutch.

06:23.960 --> 06:26.201
- Ha, ha. Rizzoli and Isles.
- Ha-ha-ha.

06:26.400 --> 06:29.927
- Special Agent Rose, Hudson.
- What the hell are you guys doing here?

06:30.120 --> 06:32.122
Our jobs.
Mind telling us what's going on?

06:32.280 --> 06:35.568
Whatever you say. Got a call
from a woman that lives upstairs.

06:35.720 --> 06:39.520
Said she heard an attack, came down,
found her neighbor here.

06:39.680 --> 06:41.444
Jacob Carter.

06:41.640 --> 06:43.881
- Who'd he say?
- Uh, Jacob Carter? I don't know.

06:44.040 --> 06:46.247
- Well, is the witness still home?
- Sure is.

06:46.400 --> 06:48.971
But she's not the most reliable type.

06:49.280 --> 06:52.887
Said she heard some kind of growl,
like there was a coyote down here.

06:53.040 --> 06:54.121
Awesome.

06:54.280 --> 06:57.807
So the FBI is here,
your neighbor got murdered...

06:57.960 --> 07:00.122
- ...but you're totally cool.
- No.

07:00.280 --> 07:03.966
It's not that I'm cool,
it's just that, like...

07:04.120 --> 07:06.487
I mean,
then it's good the FBI are here, right?

07:06.680 --> 07:08.967
That is so annoyingly logical.

07:09.120 --> 07:11.646
Hey, baby. Listen.

07:14.120 --> 07:15.804
Oh, your love is lost

07:15.960 --> 07:18.327
Oh, it's pretty. What is it?

07:18.480 --> 07:21.165
It's the song that was playing
when we first met.

07:21.320 --> 07:23.800
Oh, you are so disgustingly sweet.

07:25.280 --> 07:26.327
You ready?

07:26.480 --> 07:27.811
- Yeah.
- Cool.

07:27.960 --> 07:29.610
- I gotta go.
- What?

07:29.920 --> 07:33.686
You just foam the runway with our song
and then you gotta head out the door?

07:33.840 --> 07:36.650
I promised I'd help him test
the new cameras.

07:36.800 --> 07:37.961
Don't give me that crap.

07:38.120 --> 07:40.964
I know you two are gonna go shoot
out scenes for Jackass.

07:41.120 --> 07:44.283
Come on, we both know
he has nobody else to do this with.

07:44.480 --> 07:45.766
Rain check.

07:46.160 --> 07:48.162
Whatever, you're dead to me.

07:50.840 --> 07:53.525
- Do something cool.
- Dude, this tree is awesome.

07:53.720 --> 07:57.202
Maybe I can get upside down on it.

07:57.360 --> 07:59.761
- No, no, I said cool. This is stupid.
- Ha, ha.

07:59.920 --> 08:02.685
Can you get...? Can you see me?
Gonna try and get up.

08:02.840 --> 08:04.205
This is cool.

08:04.360 --> 08:07.523
- Because it feels pretty cool.
- It's like Dumb and Dumber Three.

08:07.680 --> 08:09.364
- Ha-ha-ha. Okay.
- BRIAN Dude.

08:09.520 --> 08:11.170
- What?
- Dude, turn around.

08:11.320 --> 08:13.368
- What?
- Turn. It's those FBI guys.

08:13.520 --> 08:16.046
- What?
- Help me down this tree.

08:16.840 --> 08:18.729
Thank you guys very much
for your help.

08:18.880 --> 08:20.564
You're free to go.

08:23.200 --> 08:28.286
- All right. There is not a case here.
- There is a case here. You're rusty.

08:28.480 --> 08:31.290
We just gotta dig a little deeper.
Come on.

08:35.760 --> 08:38.366
Dude. It's so crazy.

08:38.679 --> 08:42.048
Is it me or are you getting a workplace
romance vibe from those two?

08:42.200 --> 08:44.089
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

08:47.880 --> 08:50.531
Hey, hey, hey.
Come here, come here. Look, look, look.

08:50.680 --> 08:52.091
What?

08:52.920 --> 08:54.365
Oh, no.

08:56.560 --> 08:58.403
Yes.

08:58.560 --> 09:01.484
D-bags mating in the wild.

09:04.240 --> 09:06.686
- Okay, go, go, go.
- Yeah.

09:09.920 --> 09:11.763
Stop.

09:12.680 --> 09:14.250
- Stop.
- Hey.

09:14.400 --> 09:17.006
- Oh, ha, ha. Strike three.
- Come on.

09:17.200 --> 09:19.009
- You're a dick.
- What's your problem?

09:19.200 --> 09:21.123
This is gonna look great on YouTube.

09:23.120 --> 09:24.281
- Oh, crap.
- Oh, crap.

09:24.440 --> 09:27.091
Hey! What the hell?

09:27.240 --> 09:28.765
- Oh, crap.
- Oh, my God.

09:36.280 --> 09:38.362
Hey, Brian! Brian!

09:38.520 --> 09:41.763
Meet me at Scott's mother's house!
Oh, God.

09:41.920 --> 09:45.447
Oh, come on,
I paid her fair and square, man!

10:03.360 --> 10:05.681
Heh, heh. Thanks for a
great night out, Bri.

10:07.280 --> 10:08.805
Hello?

10:09.640 --> 10:11.324
Hello?

10:12.000 --> 10:14.401
Scott? Cut it out, man!

10:19.680 --> 10:21.808
Oh, God. Oh, God.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.607
Hey, Michael. You can come out now, dude.

10:36.760 --> 10:39.206
Scott looked for us for a while
but bailed.

10:41.320 --> 10:42.685
Mike?

10:45.680 --> 10:46.841
Mike?

10:47.040 --> 10:48.201
Dude.

10:48.400 --> 10:49.811
Oh, my God. Dude.

10:50.600 --> 10:52.125
Michael.

10:52.320 --> 10:54.209
- Are you okay, man?
- I'm okay.

10:54.360 --> 10:55.964
What happened?
- I don't know.

10:56.120 --> 10:57.690
I don't know.

10:59.040 --> 11:00.883
Oh, God.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.525
Kate!

11:05.640 --> 11:08.007
Oh, my God. Baby!

11:08.160 --> 11:10.686
- Baby. Baby.
- Something bit Michael.

11:10.840 --> 11:12.285
Baby.

11:13.680 --> 11:14.727
- Okay.
- Oh, my God.

11:14.920 --> 11:17.491
What is it? Is it bad?

11:17.640 --> 11:19.563
Brian. Kate!

11:19.720 --> 11:21.131
- Is it bad?
- The bite.

11:21.320 --> 11:23.004
The bite's gone.

11:23.200 --> 11:25.248
- It's gone.
- 911, what's your emergency?

11:25.400 --> 11:27.243
- Did you just punk me?
- Who's there?

11:27.400 --> 11:29.209
What? It's completely gone.

11:29.360 --> 11:30.885
Baby. Shh. It's okay.

11:31.080 --> 11:33.162
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, it's okay.

11:33.320 --> 11:34.890
It's okay. Baby.

11:35.240 --> 11:38.323
Hey, the doctor said
he's gonna be fine.

11:38.880 --> 11:40.644
You heard him.

11:40.920 --> 11:43.526
Literally not a scratch on the kid.

11:44.080 --> 11:47.721
If anything happens to Michael,
I don't know what I would do.

11:47.880 --> 11:50.326
Shh. It's okay.

11:57.160 --> 11:58.366
What?

12:00.520 --> 12:02.409
Uh...
- Did you just pull that off?

12:02.560 --> 12:03.721
Whoa. Whoa.

12:03.880 --> 12:05.211
Okay. Okay, okay.

12:05.360 --> 12:08.250
Now one-handed.

12:08.400 --> 12:10.562
Ha-ha-ha.
- Oh-ho-ho!

12:10.920 --> 12:13.685
- Baby, baby. Baby, stay still, stay still.
- Oh, my God.

12:14.120 --> 12:15.281
Whoa.

12:19.120 --> 12:21.122
Maybe you got bit by an alien.

12:21.280 --> 12:23.521
That would explain the FBI.

12:23.720 --> 12:25.882
Or maybe a mutant bit you.

12:26.040 --> 12:28.361
Am I a superhero now?

12:46.640 --> 12:48.449
What are you doing?

12:48.600 --> 12:50.921
What do you think I'm doing?

12:51.160 --> 12:53.242
I finally found my movie.

12:53.400 --> 12:54.970
What?

12:55.520 --> 12:57.090
Michael?

12:57.240 --> 12:59.402
Michael's not your movie.

12:59.560 --> 13:01.483
We don't even know
what happened to him.

13:01.640 --> 13:03.768
Exactly.

13:03.920 --> 13:07.163
I'm gonna get Michael's origin story
on camera.

13:10.960 --> 13:13.850
You're kind of creeping me out, man.
Seriously.

13:14.040 --> 13:17.647
Nothing super heroic to see here.
Just a delicious bagel.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.684
Hey, man, I have this idea.

13:21.920 --> 13:25.163
It's gonna sound really weird,
but don't laugh, okay?

13:25.360 --> 13:27.203
No promises.

13:30.800 --> 13:32.290
I, um...

13:33.280 --> 13:36.170
I really wanna be able to do
what you do.

13:36.320 --> 13:39.961
So I think maybe we could go back
out there, get that thing to bite me...

13:40.120 --> 13:43.886
- ...and then we can both be superheroes.
- Stop. What, are you serious?

13:44.360 --> 13:48.365
- You can't keep this to yourself.
- Keep what to myself?

13:48.520 --> 13:51.888
We don't even know what this thing is.
Why the hell would you want it?

13:52.880 --> 13:56.202
Michael,
I don't wanna be Piggy anymore, man.

13:56.360 --> 13:58.886
No, you're not a pig, man.

13:59.680 --> 14:02.206
Brian, listen to me,
there's nothing wrong with you.

14:02.400 --> 14:05.722
You just gotta figure out
what it is you want and go after it.

14:06.040 --> 14:08.646
I'm telling you, you don't want this.

14:09.680 --> 14:11.569
Because I don't wanna be
super strong...

14:11.720 --> 14:15.042
...or have a prayer of getting any ass
this year or...

14:15.200 --> 14:16.565
Please. Please.

14:16.720 --> 14:18.802
No, man.

14:19.320 --> 14:20.924
No.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.004
- Not it.
- Not it.

14:30.240 --> 14:32.083
Children.

14:39.240 --> 14:41.163
Dudes. Dudes. Dudes.

14:41.320 --> 14:42.446
It's the FBI.

14:43.240 --> 14:46.130
- What?
- It's the FBI. Move.

14:48.760 --> 14:52.082
Baby, what are you doing? Jesus.

14:53.440 --> 14:54.726
- Hi there.
- Hi.

14:54.880 --> 14:56.405
Special Agents Rose and Hudson.

14:56.560 --> 15:00.087
We wanted to ask a few questions about
the murder a few blocks from here.

15:00.240 --> 15:02.720
First off,
did you know the victim Jacob Carter?

15:02.920 --> 15:04.046
Um, not really, no.

15:04.200 --> 15:07.124
Do you remember anything unusual
about that night?

15:07.280 --> 15:09.044
- Not that I recall.
- Right.

15:09.200 --> 15:14.286
Well, heard about anyone in the
neighborhood getting, uh, you know, bit?

15:15.200 --> 15:18.249
- Humor me.
- I don't think so.

15:18.400 --> 15:20.129
Well, no worries. How about this?

15:20.280 --> 15:25.411
If you hear anything strange, call us.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.723
No matter how late.

15:28.800 --> 15:30.040
Thanks.

15:30.240 --> 15:31.730
Thank you.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.565
- Great.
- So, what do you think?

15:36.720 --> 15:39.769
Based on what we got so far, we could
be dealing with another Mayan god.

15:39.920 --> 15:43.970
Ah, that's fantastic.
Because the other one was such a joy.

15:44.200 --> 15:46.487
- Campus dormitories?
- Yeah.

15:51.160 --> 15:54.562
The FBI are looking for what bit you.

15:55.080 --> 15:57.128
Are you an X-File?

15:57.480 --> 16:00.802
No. Not an X-File.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.530
Listen.

16:04.240 --> 16:07.289
So far, we could be dealing
with another Mayan god.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.009
I'm a golden god.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.168
I am a golden god!

16:13.080 --> 16:14.844
- Hoo!
- Ha, ha. Whoo!

16:15.000 --> 16:17.810
You guys are ridiculous.

16:36.160 --> 16:38.891
I am a golden god.

16:45.280 --> 16:47.567
I am a god.

17:00.400 --> 17:01.526
Huh?

18:00.200 --> 18:02.646
What's up, BVC?

18:03.080 --> 18:05.970
It's Scotty P.,
patrolling with the Oak Hill crew.

18:06.120 --> 18:10.330
Doug, Evan, Tucker.

18:10.840 --> 18:14.322
See, some animal
killed a local citizen...

18:14.480 --> 18:18.041
...so we're out here tonight
making sure these streets are safe...

18:18.240 --> 18:20.402
...for all you fine honeys out there.

18:20.560 --> 18:23.643
- All right. Let's fan out, boys.
- All right. Let's go.

18:30.240 --> 18:31.810
Yo!

18:33.000 --> 18:35.207
Back off, douchewheel. Not tonight.

18:35.360 --> 18:38.330
Ooh. Aw, ooh. I'm so scared.

18:38.480 --> 18:40.164
Listen.

18:40.320 --> 18:43.085
What...? What the...?

18:44.840 --> 18:47.161
Got you now, you piece of...

18:52.240 --> 18:54.686
Why don't you come take your beating
like a man?

19:02.320 --> 19:06.370
If you won't come out and play,
I'll go visit that little piece of yours.

19:06.520 --> 19:07.681
Kate?

19:07.840 --> 19:11.811
Yeah, I'll go visit Katie,
show her what a real man...

19:13.200 --> 19:15.009
Michael?

19:19.720 --> 19:22.451
Dude, do you think this is funny?

19:22.720 --> 19:25.724
Come on! Cut it out.

19:33.960 --> 19:36.088
Can I ask you something about him?

19:36.240 --> 19:39.722
With everything that's happened,
are you afraid of him?

19:42.520 --> 19:44.363
At first? Yeah.

19:44.520 --> 19:47.126
I mean, it was pretty scary.

19:47.400 --> 19:52.406
But then, to be totally honest...

19:52.720 --> 19:56.202
...it's actually been pretty hot.

19:56.880 --> 19:59.406
O-M-G...

20:03.880 --> 20:06.486
Baby, just...

20:07.280 --> 20:11.729
- Can you tell us what happened?
- I ran into Scott...

20:11.880 --> 20:14.247
...he chased me
and I think I killed him.

20:14.440 --> 20:16.090
- What?
- Turn it off.

20:16.240 --> 20:18.607
What...?
- Off!

20:20.080 --> 20:23.289
He started talking about you
and I saw red.

20:23.760 --> 20:26.764
The next thing I remember,
I was running home.

20:27.720 --> 20:29.609
On the video...

20:30.920 --> 20:33.161
...what were those things on your hands?
Claws?

20:33.320 --> 20:36.767
- Did anybody see you?
- Kate. You're not trying to justify...

20:36.960 --> 20:38.769
We don't know what happened, Brian.

20:38.960 --> 20:42.601
What, he can't defend himself?
Give me that thing.

20:47.240 --> 20:49.288
- Hey. Whoa.
- Figured I'd see you guys again.

20:49.440 --> 20:52.091
Well, if you did your job right,
we wouldn't be here.

20:52.240 --> 20:54.971
- Easy. So, what do you got?
- Vic's name was Scott Parker.

20:55.120 --> 20:58.124
The same thing that killed the Carter kid
got Mr. Parker here.

20:58.280 --> 20:59.441
The same thing?

20:59.600 --> 21:05.130
Look, I'm only the local yokel,
but this kid was shredded by an animal.

21:05.480 --> 21:07.323
Where's his heart?

21:07.480 --> 21:10.324
Patrolman found it up the way there.
Eaten, mostly.

21:10.480 --> 21:11.970
Show us.

21:17.320 --> 21:19.322
Brian, wait.

21:22.280 --> 21:26.001
Did you eat a human heart? Did you?

21:26.160 --> 21:28.686
What are you talking about?
What is he talking about?

21:28.840 --> 21:32.287
Scott's dead.
He was shredded and his heart's gone.

21:32.440 --> 21:34.807
- Doesn't mean that...
- What do you think happened?

21:34.960 --> 21:36.849
- Where's his heart?
- I don't remember.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.651
- Don't lie to me.
- Hey. Brian, calm down.

21:39.800 --> 21:43.486
Look, I mean,
there's gotta be an explanation for this.

21:43.640 --> 21:45.324
Really?

21:45.520 --> 21:50.526
- It was self-defense.
- Eating a hear': is self-defense?

21:50.680 --> 21:53.684
- You trying to convince me or yourself?
- You need to back off.

21:53.840 --> 21:57.367
Why? You gonna eat my heart too?

21:58.120 --> 21:59.929
Michael!

22:03.040 --> 22:05.520
I don't know what's happening to me.

22:06.880 --> 22:09.531
I don't know who I am anymore.

22:09.840 --> 22:12.207
You're Michael Wheeler.

22:13.360 --> 22:15.567
And you're mine, okay?

22:15.720 --> 22:17.688
You hear me?

22:26.200 --> 22:29.044
- We have to call the police.
- Brian.

22:30.280 --> 22:32.203
Kate, how can you?

22:32.400 --> 22:34.448
You have to see
what's really going on here.

22:34.640 --> 22:37.120
Whatever he is, it's not good.
It's not good for you.

22:37.280 --> 22:39.282
- Michael didn't mean to hurt you.
- He did.

22:39.440 --> 22:42.091
What? You just don't get it, do you?

22:42.240 --> 22:45.642
- What? What don't I understand?
- You've never been in love.

22:48.400 --> 22:52.724
What we need are answers.

22:56.920 --> 22:58.729
I can't hear them.

22:58.920 --> 23:03.767
- Seriously, Kate. What are we doing?
- What are we doing? Seriously?

23:04.160 --> 23:07.084
Wait. Kate, don't.

23:07.760 --> 23:11.048
Let's see.
Cut marks on both vics are clean...

23:11.240 --> 23:13.811
...but have the curvature
of animal claws.

23:13.960 --> 23:17.885
I don't know. I mean, maybe
there's a wild animal on the loose.

23:18.600 --> 23:21.604
The biggest animal in the county
is a raccoon.

23:22.120 --> 23:25.602
- Thank you for your time. Appreciate it.
- Yeah.

23:26.280 --> 23:28.442
- No. No.
- Hey. Hey.

23:28.600 --> 23:30.443
So what'd I miss? Anything?

23:30.600 --> 23:33.285
Not unless you wanna put an APB out
on Rocky Raccoon.

23:33.440 --> 23:36.808
Great.
The local police files are not online.

23:36.960 --> 23:38.849
I had to dig
through the county records.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.526
Ten years ago,
there was a similar unsolved murder.

23:41.720 --> 23:44.769
- Check it out.
- Death by claws and lack of heart?

23:44.920 --> 23:48.208
- So we're talking a...
- No. Not that time of the month.

23:49.320 --> 23:51.288
- Awesome.
- Yeah.

23:51.440 --> 23:53.010
Time to hit the books.

23:53.240 --> 23:55.129
And feed the monster.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.810
They know something. We gotta follow them.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.163
Michael. Come on. Michael.

24:04.560 --> 24:05.925
Jeez.

24:06.080 --> 24:07.320
How'd you find us?

24:07.480 --> 24:11.485
GPS in your phones. Duh.

24:12.320 --> 24:14.846
You know,
you're starting to creep me out, man.

24:15.160 --> 24:17.731
The feeling is mutual, dude.

24:17.880 --> 24:20.326
What else can you hack into, Brian?

24:21.680 --> 24:23.330
Anything-

24:29.000 --> 24:30.365
Test. Test. Can you hear me?

24:30.640 --> 24:32.165
Copy that.

24:32.360 --> 24:35.682
Yeah, the feed is looping to my laptop
right now.

24:36.320 --> 24:40.086
Head in, make sure you're within spitting
distance, we should be in business.

24:40.440 --> 24:44.490
Um, and don't get arrested.

24:45.120 --> 24:46.360
- I'll do it.
- Sure?

24:46.520 --> 24:48.648
Yeah. Give me the bag.

25:02.200 --> 25:03.361
We good?

25:03.720 --> 25:05.688
Uh, a little left.

25:08.280 --> 25:09.611
How's that?

25:09.800 --> 25:11.450
Shh.

25:12.040 --> 25:14.247
Awesome. Thank you.

25:14.400 --> 25:15.561
Thanks.

25:16.720 --> 25:18.688
Dude. Two burgers?

25:18.840 --> 25:21.889
Hey.
I didn't eat at Big P's for like a year.

25:22.080 --> 25:23.241
Okay?

25:23.400 --> 25:26.563
Clear eyes and clogged arteries,
can't lose.

25:29.360 --> 25:30.771
Hey, check this out.

25:30.960 --> 25:35.204
"Werewolves that are turned
up to four generations from pure blood..."

25:35.360 --> 25:37.328
You think he means Alpha?

25:38.440 --> 25:43.571
"... Are less feral and can transform
before, during and after the lunar cycle."

25:43.760 --> 25:44.807
Boom.

25:44.960 --> 25:48.248
Let me see. Pure bloods don't
black out during their transformation.

25:48.440 --> 25:49.771
They can control themselves.

25:49.920 --> 25:52.924
Some have been able to subsist
off of animal hearts.

25:53.080 --> 25:57.449
So what? We're hunting a werewolf
with a pedigree?

25:57.600 --> 25:59.762
Awesome.
Let's hope he has his papers.

25:59.920 --> 26:01.649
Yeah. And that silver can kill him.

26:01.840 --> 26:06.129
Best in Show comes here 10 years ago,
ganked some woman.

26:06.280 --> 26:09.284
Dust settles, everything's in the clear,
he just sets up shop?

26:09.440 --> 26:12.091
Yeah. Comes for the human hearts,
stays for the co-eds.

26:12.240 --> 26:14.402
Right.
And then everything's wine and roses...

26:14.560 --> 26:17.928
...and animal tickers, until it gets
the hankering for human again.

26:18.280 --> 26:22.285
Told you there was a case here. Now
we just gotta find it and kill it.

26:26.800 --> 26:29.929
I'm a werewolf. A werewolf.

26:30.080 --> 26:32.686
- You need to calm down.
- Calm down? I'm a werewolf.

26:32.840 --> 26:35.081
- Get him out of here.
- FBI wants to kill me.

26:35.280 --> 26:37.362
Shut up! Everybody shut up. Okay?

26:37.520 --> 26:40.763
First things first.
Those guys aren't FBI.

26:40.920 --> 26:45.050
All right? I'm pretty sure that FBI agents
don't say "awesome" that much.

26:45.680 --> 26:49.480
You know, and they definitely don't hunt
and kill college kids.

26:49.880 --> 26:52.326
Did they say anything else?

26:52.480 --> 26:56.041
Dude, they just sat and talked about
how they've been apart for a year.

26:56.200 --> 26:59.602
You were probably right
about that whole office romance thing.

26:59.800 --> 27:02.849
- I'm screwed. I'm screwed.
- Kate, what are we supposed to do?

27:03.000 --> 27:07.050
Okay. You know what? You guys,
you're missing the big picture. Okay?

27:07.200 --> 27:10.204
They don't know about you, Michael.

27:10.440 --> 27:14.889
They're looking for whoever, whatever,
bit you in the first place.

27:15.040 --> 27:17.042
The pure blood.

27:19.560 --> 27:22.006
That gives us some time.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.002
Figure it out, you know?

27:25.200 --> 27:26.690
So, what's the plan?

27:27.040 --> 27:29.361
Gotta eat chicken hearts
for the rest of my life?

27:29.520 --> 27:32.251
Michael. Baby.

27:36.720 --> 27:38.245
Oh, God.

27:39.080 --> 27:40.730
Oh, God.

27:43.840 --> 27:45.922
Oh, God. Aah...

27:56.400 --> 27:58.209
', guys.

27:58.880 --> 28:01.247
I think I found something.

28:45.160 --> 28:49.290
Little early for office hours,
Brian. What can I help you with?

28:50.760 --> 28:52.762
I know what you are.

28:59.920 --> 29:05.802
When I was a boy, I got
lost inside the void

29:07.760 --> 29:11.128
The century woods full of tree...

29:16.080 --> 29:17.844
Hey. What are you doing?

29:18.480 --> 29:21.484
- We're leaving in the morning.
- What? Why?

29:21.640 --> 29:23.529
Those guys, they might find Michael...

29:23.680 --> 29:26.001
No, Kate, you don't have
to worry about that.

29:26.200 --> 29:28.487
You don't have to worry.
I took care of it.

29:28.640 --> 29:30.483
Took care of what?

29:31.920 --> 29:35.641
Brian, what did you do?

29:38.000 --> 29:41.686
Heh. I know what you are.

29:44.160 --> 29:46.003
Yeah. I'm your professor.

29:46.160 --> 29:49.164
And thanks, I've been looking for that.
Where did you find it?

29:49.320 --> 29:51.049
Where you left it.

29:51.200 --> 29:52.690
After you bit my friend.

29:52.840 --> 29:55.844
- I'm sorry. What are you...?
- Stop, stop. Stop trying to cover.

29:56.000 --> 29:59.129
Just listen to me very carefully.
I'm filming all this.

29:59.280 --> 30:01.169
I've got a hidden camera in here too.

30:01.520 --> 30:03.363
It's feeding back to my laptop
at home.

30:03.520 --> 30:05.010
So if anything happens to me...

30:05.160 --> 30:08.243
Nothing is going to happen to you, Brian.
You need to calm down.

30:08.400 --> 30:10.846
I want you to turn me
into a werewolf.

30:13.520 --> 30:15.841
- Brian, I don't know where you...
- You don't know?

30:17.240 --> 30:19.846
Really? Huh.

30:20.040 --> 30:22.361
- Well, how about I cut you with this
- Brian.

30:22.520 --> 30:23.681
It's made of silver.

30:24.840 --> 30:27.844
Look, I'm not...
Please. I'm not what you think, Brian.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.401
I don't care what you are.
I just want you to turn me.

30:35.120 --> 30:37.043
I don't wanna hurt you.

30:37.200 --> 30:38.326
You're not going to.

30:38.520 --> 30:42.730
Because if you do,
all this winds up on CNN.

30:46.920 --> 30:49.571
So you stumbled on Carter,
wolfed out and then what?

30:49.720 --> 30:51.688
Got a taste for hearts again?

30:53.040 --> 30:56.249
You never lose the taste,
if you're stupid enough to have one.

30:56.400 --> 30:59.847
Once you have a human head,
it's almost impossible...

31:00.040 --> 31:01.610
...to control the monster inside.

31:01.760 --> 31:03.569
But I did.

31:03.760 --> 31:09.244
Until last week when I, uh,
fell off the wagon, as they say.

31:09.400 --> 31:13.246
You have no idea,
no idea how hard it is.

31:13.960 --> 31:16.201
I've trained myself not to hurt anyone.

31:16.360 --> 31:20.604
I have trained myself
to choke down those other hearts.

31:20.760 --> 31:22.125
Animal hearts.

31:22.280 --> 31:25.762
- And I have been clean.
- Until last week.

31:29.600 --> 31:31.284
Then I saw Carter.

31:31.440 --> 31:33.602
Alone. And he was...

31:34.440 --> 31:35.771
He looked so weak.

31:35.920 --> 31:38.161
It's harder to cover things up
nowadays.

31:38.320 --> 31:41.244
I knew a hunter would catch wind of this
sooner or later.

31:41.400 --> 31:44.768
They did. They're here.

31:45.480 --> 31:48.689
You needed a patsy. Michael.

31:50.240 --> 31:51.969
Yes.

31:52.280 --> 31:57.286
The young man who sleeps through
most of my lectures.

31:57.960 --> 32:00.122
I mean, who would miss him?

32:00.480 --> 32:02.130
Me.

32:03.080 --> 32:04.320
Why are you doing this?

32:04.520 --> 32:07.364
I wanna see what you guys see.

32:07.640 --> 32:11.486
Do what you do.
I'm sick of being Piggy.

32:12.080 --> 32:13.445
I wanna be Ralph.

32:13.600 --> 32:16.729
We don't get to choose who we are.

32:20.480 --> 32:22.608
I did.

32:23.040 --> 32:26.487
- Oh, my God.
- Brian. What, are you insane?

32:26.640 --> 32:28.369
You're welcome.

32:28.520 --> 32:30.602
For saving your ass. Look, watch.

32:45.320 --> 32:47.004
Hey!

32:57.200 --> 32:58.884
Thank you.

33:00.520 --> 33:03.330
I've never killed a pureblood before.

33:04.360 --> 33:06.044
What was he looking at?

33:06.200 --> 33:07.804
What the hell?

33:10.520 --> 33:14.730
See? Problem solved.

33:14.880 --> 33:17.531
They killed the pureblood.
They're moving on.

33:17.720 --> 33:19.529
We're in the clear, just like you said.

33:19.720 --> 33:26.046
- I never said...
- Kate, I did this to protect you.

33:26.880 --> 33:29.042
I did what you couldn't.

33:29.440 --> 33:33.729
They saw the camera, Brian. You don't
think they'll trace that back to you?

33:33.880 --> 33:35.723
What the hell is wrong with you?

33:39.440 --> 33:40.601
Nothing's wrong with me.

33:40.800 --> 33:42.802
You told me that.

33:43.440 --> 33:48.731
Heh. I just finally figured out what
I want. And now I'm going after it.

33:48.920 --> 33:51.241
You thought I was hiding behind this?

33:52.360 --> 33:54.522
I was hiding behind you.

33:57.840 --> 34:01.606
I am done living in your shadow.

34:01.760 --> 34:04.081
I've always lived in your shadow.

34:04.240 --> 34:05.730
But now?

34:05.880 --> 34:07.882
Now we're equals.

34:08.040 --> 34:11.567
- Anything you can do, right?
- What, you think this is a game?

34:12.080 --> 34:14.924
Do you have any idea
what you've done to yourself?

34:15.080 --> 34:17.924
- You wouldn't bite me, so I had to...
- You asked him to?

34:18.080 --> 34:21.243
- He asked you to bite him?
- I didn't, okay?

34:21.400 --> 34:24.847
I didn't wanna hurt you.
I would never hurt you, Brian.

34:26.239 --> 34:28.129
This thing inside of me,
you don't want this.

34:28.280 --> 34:30.760
Well, it's too late for that now.

34:31.480 --> 34:33.562
I remember attacking Scott...

34:33.719 --> 34:35.927
...ripping his beating heart
out of his chest.

34:36.080 --> 34:39.801
I remember the look in his dead eyes
when I bit into that heart, Brian.

34:39.960 --> 34:43.646
And above all, I remember how sweet,
how delicious it tasted.

34:43.800 --> 34:46.326
And ever since I tasted it,
I've felt more powerful...

34:46.520 --> 34:48.648
...and more out of control.

34:49.880 --> 34:53.601
More weak. You don't need Michael. You
need someone who can take care of you.

34:53.760 --> 34:55.489
I can take care of myself.

34:57.320 --> 34:58.481
Let her go.

34:58.640 --> 35:00.529
Or what?

35:00.760 --> 35:02.524
You're gonna cry some more?

35:05.000 --> 35:07.765
No! No! No.

35:08.160 --> 35:09.810
No!

35:22.160 --> 35:26.404
God! God!

35:29.040 --> 35:30.201
Please don't die.

35:30.400 --> 35:32.562
Please don't die, please don't die.

35:32.920 --> 35:34.729
I'm so sorry.

35:35.160 --> 35:37.208
- I love you, baby.
- I love you.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.729
Michael?

35:41.320 --> 35:42.526
Michael?

35:57.200 --> 35:59.567
Kate. Listen to me!

36:00.000 --> 36:02.367
I love you. I love you.

36:02.520 --> 36:05.171
You'll understand.
You just need to see what I see.

36:05.320 --> 36:08.722
After I bite you, you'll understand. Aah!

36:19.880 --> 36:21.086
Kate.

36:21.680 --> 36:23.409
Let me in.

36:24.880 --> 36:27.963
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

36:28.720 --> 36:30.882
We can fix this. We can...

36:31.080 --> 36:33.686
Just let me in. Okay?

36:54.080 --> 36:56.082
Brian?

36:57.240 --> 36:59.527
Brian, I'm coming out.

37:00.440 --> 37:02.329
I see it now.

37:03.760 --> 37:05.649
I understand.

37:08.800 --> 37:11.326
I told you it would be all right.

37:11.760 --> 37:15.321
Yeah. It will be.

37:15.760 --> 37:17.285
Here.

37:23.760 --> 37:25.444
No! No!

37:38.800 --> 37:42.361
I didn't finish Brian's movie
to justify what happened.

37:43.840 --> 37:46.207
To be totally honest...

37:46.640 --> 37:49.962
...I'm not really even sure
if I understand it at all.

37:51.200 --> 37:56.001
I just wanted you to know
that Michael wasn't always a monster.

37:57.480 --> 37:59.482
None of us were.

38:02.640 --> 38:04.483
Five years from now?

38:04.640 --> 38:08.884
Hopefully passed the bar exam.
Practicing law.

38:09.080 --> 38:10.684
Nothing corporate.

38:10.840 --> 38:13.320
Something green, you know?

38:13.840 --> 38:15.524
Oh, jeez. Um...

38:16.000 --> 38:18.128
Maybe, like, working for HBO.

38:18.280 --> 38:21.011
Or, like, Michael Moore.
That'd be cool.

38:21.160 --> 38:23.401
I will be on a boat in
the middle of the ocean.

38:23.600 --> 38:26.410
- My beautiful girl by my side.
- Aw...

38:28.680 --> 38:32.401
What's the matter?
What's the matter with you lately?

38:32.560 --> 38:34.369
I'm leaving.

38:34.720 --> 38:37.644
And you'll never hear from me
ever again.

38:38.160 --> 38:41.084
Look, I know that there's another way.

38:41.240 --> 38:43.686
I can eat animal hearts.

38:45.520 --> 38:47.727
I've never hurt anyone.

38:48.760 --> 38:52.242
Nobody human anyway.

38:54.360 --> 38:56.727
I didn't choose this.

38:57.680 --> 38:59.444
Please.

39:01.040 --> 39:03.407
Please give me a chance.

39:19.800 --> 39:21.086
Okay.

39:23.360 --> 39:26.409
- So this is Michael.
- Yeah.

39:26.560 --> 39:29.370
- Which means that that is...
- Brian Wilcox.

39:29.520 --> 39:33.241
- Our friendly neighborhood cameraman.
- Right.

39:35.760 --> 39:40.243
All right. So, what,
she's got about a half-day jump on us.

39:41.600 --> 39:43.250
Mm-hm.

39:44.280 --> 39:45.930
You all right?

39:46.400 --> 39:47.481
Mm-hm.

39:48.560 --> 39:52.246
Look, Kate's right.
She hasn't hurt anybody.

39:52.400 --> 39:54.209
Well, anybody human, at least.

39:55.920 --> 39:59.447
And she didn't choose this.

39:59.760 --> 40:00.807
Let's give her a shot.

40:02.320 --> 40:03.446
Seriously?

40:04.320 --> 40:07.449
- Yeah, yeah.
- And, look, if Kate pops back up...

40:07.600 --> 40:09.921
...I mean, if she strays...

40:10.080 --> 40:13.129
...then no questions asked,
we do what we gotta do...

40:13.560 --> 40:15.562
...and we take her down.

40:17.280 --> 40:18.441
Hey, Sam.

40:18.640 --> 40:19.721
Yeah?

40:22.080 --> 40:23.969
Do I really say "awesome" a lot?

40:25.440 --> 40:27.807
No. No, no, no.

40:33.640 --> 40:35.244
Huh.

40:39.360 --> 40:41.249
Awesome.

40:48.480 --> 40:51.529
...Matter with you lately?
