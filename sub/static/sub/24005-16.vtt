39:39.127 --> 39:40.795
at our sandman here.

39:40.795 --> 39:42.881
Unlike the strength test,
this is all about

to this target.

39:45.133 --> 39:46.551
Josh, you're up first.
Are you ready for this?

These are sharp.

You can see these cuts,

just clean rakes
across the chest.

40:10.033 --> 40:13.661
No tearing. I actually like
that hook you've got.

40:13.661 --> 40:15.622
These are definitely cutters.
Nicely done.

40:15.622 --> 40:17.540

is beautiful and clean.

40:40.647 --> 40:42.649
They're very light, very fast.

These are very nice weapons.

nuts and bolts challenge

40:52.617 --> 40:54.452
came down to these bagh nakh.

40:54.452 --> 40:57.705
Both of you have put in
an incredible amount of work.

Unfortunately, in this arena

41:08.341 --> 41:10.677
Good job.
Josh, unfortunately,

41:10.677 --> 41:12.679
your bagh nakh
did not make the cut.

41:12.679 --> 41:15.723

41:21.354 --> 41:22.480

I have to let you go.
