You can't be sick.

00:15.216 --> 00:16.915
I don't know how to do

Can i have a sick day,

It wants to know if you have
a crushing weight on your chest.

00:37.805 --> 00:38.904
Do you have a crushing weight?

00:38.906 --> 00:40.739
Yep. Crushing weight.
Yep, yep.

00:40.741 --> 00:42.808

00:42.810 --> 00:45.778
Oh, no! Oh, no!
Maya, i really do.

I have the foo foos!
It's like there's an elephant

00:50.351 --> 00:52.384
I am at most
a labradoodle.

00:53.954 --> 00:56.388
Maya, you have to get
far, far away from me.

00:56.390 --> 00:57.656
I don't want you
to catch this.

00:57.658 --> 00:59.658
I know.
That would be terrible.

01:08.269 --> 01:10.903
Okay, now can we please
go to school now
and get out of rileytown?

01:13.607 --> 01:15.741
What? I just said,
"can we get out
of rileytow--" oof.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.411
What is it with you?
That's just a word i made up.

01:19.413 --> 01:20.879
I know what it means.

01:20.881 --> 01:23.282
It means that i'm goofy
and silly and weird.

01:23.284 --> 01:25.617
-It means you're unique.
-I don't want to be unique.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.353
I don't want
anybody to notice me.

01:28.355 --> 01:30.589
Since when?
Rileytown is where you live.

01:43.571 --> 01:46.038
Is this serious

01:46.040 --> 01:47.606
You are a bully.

Okay, that's not fun.

I don't like

Nobody likes being laughed at.

I'm not laughing at you.
Who's laughing at you?

01:57.418 --> 01:59.451

In what ways do human beings
resolve conflict?

03:03.884 --> 03:05.350
Bring in the mama.

03:06.654 --> 03:07.953
They talk it out.

03:07.955 --> 03:09.988
-They go to war.
-Why can't they talk it out?

03:09.990 --> 03:12.524
-They go to war.
-Oh, okay. You and me
against farkle.

03:13.694 --> 03:14.927
They talk it out.

03:14.929 --> 03:16.528
-They go to war!
-Let's get him!

03:21.769 --> 03:23.669
You shoulda talked it out.

03:25.472 --> 03:28.540
Many conflicts escalate
and do not end well.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.943
The story of alexander hamilton
and aaron burr

03:30.945 --> 03:32.544
Is a prime example.

03:32.546 --> 03:33.612
Anybody know what happened?

03:33.614 --> 03:34.746
Riley?

03:34.748 --> 03:36.648
Please stop picking on me.

03:36.650 --> 03:38.100
What?

03:38.101 --> 03:39.551
They had a duel.
Burr killed hamilton.

03:39.553 --> 03:42.020
In 1791, burr captured
a senate seat

03:42.022 --> 03:43.622
From hamilton's
father-in-law,

03:43.624 --> 03:45.624
Which launched their rivalry.

03:45.626 --> 03:48.927
Then burr accused hamilton
of publicly insulting him.

03:48.929 --> 03:51.129
(phone dings)

03:51.131 --> 03:53.565
Riley, no one
should be texting you in class.

03:55.469 --> 03:57.135
I agree.

03:57.137 --> 03:59.538
I don't want you to say
"rileytown" anymore.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.106
I like rileytown.

04:01.108 --> 04:03.709
I like you and i like
to say whatever i want.

04:03.711 --> 04:06.612
Now, burr challenged
hamilton to a duel

04:06.614 --> 04:07.879
To resolve their conflict.

04:07.881 --> 04:09.548
Maybe that's what we should do.

04:09.550 --> 04:11.550
Maybe you want to hear
what happened to them first.

04:12.753 --> 04:15.520
Hamilton believed the duel
wasn't morally right,

04:15.522 --> 04:17.789
So he fired his pistol
in the air.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.825
Burr, believing
he had been shot at,

04:19.827 --> 04:22.561
Fired at hamilton
and killed him.

04:22.563 --> 04:24.663
So, why am i telling
you guys a story

04:24.665 --> 04:27.699
About what happens when
you fail to resolve
a conflict peacefully?

04:28.702 --> 04:29.901
Lucas?

04:29.903 --> 04:31.103
People get hurt.

04:31.105 --> 04:32.638
What do we need to learn?

04:32.639 --> 04:34.172
I need to learn
how to resolve a conflict.

04:34.174 --> 04:36.041
What's going on?

04:37.745 --> 04:39.044
She thinks i'm a bully

04:39.046 --> 04:41.613
Because i keep saying
something she doesn't like.

04:41.615 --> 04:44.216
A bully isn't someone who
says something you don't like.

04:44.218 --> 04:46.451
A bully is someone
who uses power

04:46.453 --> 04:48.153
And intimidation
to hurt others.

04:48.155 --> 04:51.023
There's a big difference between
having a conflict with a friend

04:51.025 --> 04:52.624
And having a bully.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.760
So don't just
throw that word around.

04:54.762 --> 04:56.995
There are other words
you shouldn't just
throw around, either.

04:56.997 --> 04:59.665
What? Like rileytown,
the place where you live

04:59.667 --> 05:01.033
Because you're there right now?

05:01.035 --> 05:02.534
I asked you not to.

05:02.536 --> 05:04.136
Why do we have to
keep on talking about this?

05:04.138 --> 05:07.072
Because the most powerful tool
in the human being arsenal

05:07.074 --> 05:10.142
Is the ability to solve
conflict with words.

05:10.144 --> 05:12.944
You think
i'm goofy, silly and weird.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.813
No kidding.

05:14.815 --> 05:18.517
You're unique and wonderful,
and i love it here in rileytown.

05:21.488 --> 05:22.954
I challenge you to a duel.

05:22.956 --> 05:27.092
Okay, you're not really
understanding this at all.

05:28.729 --> 05:31.063
Maya, please
help her understand.

05:33.067 --> 05:34.199
I accept.

05:36.503 --> 05:37.903
Duel to the death.

05:37.905 --> 05:39.871
Thank you very much.

05:41.742 --> 05:44.576
(drum and fife play)

05:52.553 --> 05:55.620
You will come back
to me after the war,
won't you, darlin'?

05:56.924 --> 05:58.857
Just give me
the ice cream, farkle.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.093
Why are you
my second, huckleberry?

06:01.095 --> 06:02.861
Shouldn't you be
over there with riley?

06:02.863 --> 06:05.530
Well, it was decided that
if things get out of hand,

06:05.532 --> 06:07.699
I was the best choice to...

06:07.701 --> 06:09.634
Contain you.

06:11.004 --> 06:13.238
Oh. You think you can?

06:13.240 --> 06:15.640
Yeah, but i'll probably
pay for it pretty good.

06:20.981 --> 06:22.814
Why would you
let them do this?

06:22.816 --> 06:25.684
Oh, it's a slow day
and the ice cream
expires tomorrow.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.189
What are you doing?

06:31.191 --> 06:32.624
I'm itchy.

06:33.560 --> 06:36.061
Maya, as the one
challenged to this duel,

06:36.063 --> 06:38.147
You get the first shot.

06:38.148 --> 06:40.232
All right, you'll take
three paces, turn, and fire.

06:40.234 --> 06:42.033
How do you know
how to do this so well, zay?

06:42.035 --> 06:44.336
Well, back in texas,
we call this a wednesday.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.873
Ice cream ready?

06:49.643 --> 06:51.076
One...

06:51.078 --> 06:52.677
Two...

06:52.679 --> 06:53.979
Three...

06:53.981 --> 06:55.580
Turn...

06:55.582 --> 06:56.681
Fire!

06:56.683 --> 06:57.749
Wait a minute.

06:58.786 --> 07:00.218
Something's wrong.

07:02.689 --> 07:04.589
Oh, that would have been bad.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.225
Fire!

07:12.666 --> 07:15.066
That's the best way to
resolve a conflict i ever saw.

07:16.336 --> 07:18.703
This tastes one day
before expired.

07:18.705 --> 07:20.639
Riley, take a hint, please,

07:20.641 --> 07:22.007
So we can
all be done with this.

07:23.143 --> 07:24.776
This will be done
when you treat me like

07:24.778 --> 07:27.212
An ordinary person
who nobody notices.

07:27.214 --> 07:29.948
You're not. You're a sweet,
weird little goofball

07:29.950 --> 07:31.650
And i love you
just the way you are.

07:31.652 --> 07:32.684
Deal with it.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.665
No need to contain me, lucas.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.333
I'm fine.

07:48.335 --> 07:50.202
How are you fine?
You don't look fine.

07:51.171 --> 07:53.271
Because that's
not riley at all.

07:53.273 --> 07:54.372
Something's really wrong.

07:54.374 --> 07:56.708
Mr. And mrs. Matthews...

07:58.312 --> 07:59.678
Riley and i
have a conflict.

08:01.782 --> 08:04.015
It won't teach us anything
if you guys step in.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.753
Okay.

08:08.755 --> 08:09.788
We're here if you need us.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.756
I know.

08:19.766 --> 08:21.132
Why are you so calm?

08:21.134 --> 08:23.268
Because this isn't her.

08:23.270 --> 08:25.237
This isn't riley at all.

08:25.239 --> 08:26.905
Well, what could have
changed her all of a sudden?

08:26.907 --> 08:28.907
This is like when i always
used to wear my turtlenecks

08:28.909 --> 08:30.909
And then there was somebody
that didn't like that i...

08:32.145 --> 08:33.311
Oh, my gosh.

08:33.313 --> 08:34.379
What?

08:36.083 --> 08:37.716
What are you looking at?

08:37.718 --> 08:38.683
You gots to go.

08:38.685 --> 08:39.918
-What?
-We need more towels.

08:39.920 --> 08:41.253
-What?
-Maya needs more towels.

08:41.255 --> 08:42.454
-I'm fine.
-Get her more towels!

08:42.456 --> 08:43.989
-Okay.
-Yes, sir.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.259
What's going on?

08:48.362 --> 08:49.812
Of course
she loves rileytown.

08:49.813 --> 08:51.263
Of course she's weird
and goofy and unique.

08:51.265 --> 08:52.397
That's what we all
love about her.

08:52.399 --> 08:53.465
So what's the problem?

08:53.467 --> 08:54.733
Somebody doesn't.

08:54.735 --> 08:55.834
What?

08:55.836 --> 08:57.168
Riley doesn't
want to be her

08:57.170 --> 08:58.837
Because she feels
like a nothing.

08:58.839 --> 09:00.705
Because a bully makes
you feel like a nothing.

09:00.707 --> 09:01.940
A bully took
something i liked

09:01.942 --> 09:03.875
About myself and made
me feel bad about it.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.710
But why would she think
i would ever do that?

09:05.712 --> 09:07.846
I'm her best friend.
Why is she yelling at me?

09:07.848 --> 09:09.748
Because i think she's
trying to get you to hear her.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.817
Hear what?

09:11.818 --> 09:13.885
Why does she keep
talking about a bully
if she knows i'm not--

09:13.887 --> 09:15.353
What?

09:17.291 --> 09:18.390
Oh, no.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.196
What? She's gone?

09:25.198 --> 09:26.565
Yep.

09:26.566 --> 09:27.933
Well, what are we supposed
to do with these towels?

09:27.935 --> 09:29.167
They're not for maya.

09:29.169 --> 09:30.235
Well, who are they for?

09:30.237 --> 09:31.303
They're for you.

09:32.739 --> 09:33.905
What?

09:34.908 --> 09:36.508
-Farkle, what are you doing?
Stop--
-don't...

09:36.510 --> 09:39.077
Mistake my size and demeanor
for a lack of crazy

09:39.079 --> 09:41.146
Because i got it
and i'll use it.

09:41.148 --> 09:42.347
So stay where you are.

09:42.349 --> 09:44.383
Okay.

09:44.384 --> 09:46.418
I am your best friend
and i need you to trust me.

09:46.420 --> 09:48.670
Uh-uh. I'm his best friend.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.921
If you were his best friend,
you'd know to tie him up
right now.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.958
Look, i'mma just do it.
I don't need an explanation.

09:55.128 --> 09:57.028
I'm gonna tell
you something bad

09:57.029 --> 09:58.929
And i need you to
not turn into texas lucas.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.099
(chuckles)

10:01.100 --> 10:03.267
Farkle, nothing is going
to turn me back into that.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.337
Something's happening
to riley.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.506
What?

10:21.788 --> 10:23.221
We have something
to talk about, you and me.

10:23.223 --> 10:25.824
I don't like it
when we fight.

10:25.826 --> 10:28.793
I'm going to be your friend
for the rest of your life.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.463
We're gonna have
some conflicts along the way.

10:31.465 --> 10:33.431
What do we do?

10:33.433 --> 10:35.266
We will work them out.

10:35.268 --> 10:37.869
We'll always work them out
because we're friends.

10:37.871 --> 10:40.205
And if things get rough,
maybe we'll throw

10:40.206 --> 10:42.540
Some ice cream at each other,
but we'll still be friends

10:42.542 --> 10:44.943
Because that's what
reasonable people do.

10:44.945 --> 10:46.845
So we have
no conflict anymore?

10:46.847 --> 10:48.446
No.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.115
Now we have a new one.

10:51.885 --> 10:53.918
Why wouldn't you come to me?

10:56.256 --> 10:59.124
How could you not come to me
if someone is bullying you?

11:01.862 --> 11:03.361
I'm humiliated, maya.

11:05.399 --> 11:07.465
I didn't want to let
you see me humiliated.

11:07.467 --> 11:09.601
You thought it would
just go away?

11:09.603 --> 11:11.136
Mm-hmm.

11:12.539 --> 11:14.339
It's getting worse.

11:15.942 --> 11:17.776
You know what
the difference is

11:17.777 --> 11:19.611
Between a conflict with a bully
and a conflict with a friend?

11:19.613 --> 11:20.879
What?

11:25.352 --> 11:27.118
You're the worst
bully ever, peaches.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.087
(chuckles) i know.

11:31.091 --> 11:33.024
Peaches the bully just...

11:33.026 --> 11:34.893
Doesn't strike fear
into the hearts of anybody.

11:36.229 --> 11:39.130
I called you a bully
and i ice creamed you.

11:39.132 --> 11:41.166
I'm really sorry.

11:41.168 --> 11:43.334
It's okay.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.471
Will you get back at me
for the ice cream?

11:46.473 --> 11:48.139
Oh, yeah, and you're
never gonna see it coming.

11:48.141 --> 11:50.041
Couldn't you tell me
just before you were
gonna do it?

11:50.043 --> 11:52.277
No, honey. That would
hurt my enjoyment.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.881
I'm sorry i took
everything out on you.

11:56.883 --> 11:58.883
It's okay.

11:58.885 --> 12:01.019
You had to take it out
on somebody.

12:01.988 --> 12:05.023
I'm glad you felt safe enough
to take it out on me.

12:06.660 --> 12:09.461
And i'm sorry i didn't hear
what you were trying
to say earlier.

12:10.664 --> 12:14.065
Well, i will
never go at you again.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.368
No, it's okay.
I can take it.

12:18.371 --> 12:19.971
-Let it all out.
-I'm better now.

12:19.973 --> 12:23.007
Oh, yeah. I'm sure you are.
That's good.

12:25.312 --> 12:27.378
-Rileytown.
-Stop saying that!

12:27.380 --> 12:28.980
People shouldn't make fun
of other people.

12:28.982 --> 12:30.348
What did i ever do to you?

12:35.956 --> 12:37.021
You exist.

12:38.992 --> 12:40.458
You exist, and you're weird,

12:40.460 --> 12:41.926
And you get in the way
of where i'm looking,

12:41.928 --> 12:44.996
So stop being weird
and stop being happy.

12:44.998 --> 12:48.066
Nobody should be
as happy as you.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.636
Stop being who you are...

12:53.540 --> 12:58.243
Or i'm gonna put my foot
in your weird, stupid face.

13:00.413 --> 13:02.080
Okay.

13:02.082 --> 13:04.115
(crying)

13:06.119 --> 13:06.985
I'm fine.

13:06.987 --> 13:08.953
I'm not. How long?

13:09.689 --> 13:12.056
A few weeks.

13:12.058 --> 13:14.159
This has been going on
a few weeks.

13:15.362 --> 13:16.628
Riles, i got you.

13:16.630 --> 13:19.164
I tried
dealing with her, maya.

13:19.166 --> 13:21.099
She's not a reasonable person.

13:21.101 --> 13:22.267
How do i handle this?

13:22.269 --> 13:23.401
I don't know
how to handle this.

13:23.403 --> 13:25.353
Not alone.

13:25.354 --> 13:27.304
But i thought i was supposed to
learn how to resolve a conflict.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.140
-You have a bully!
-And i have conflict?

13:29.142 --> 13:31.109
-You are incredibly screwy.
-And i'm screwy,

13:31.111 --> 13:33.178
And i have a bully,
and i have a conflict?

13:35.982 --> 13:38.049
What a tough day
in rileytown.

13:39.653 --> 13:42.320
Okay. So now we
know two things.

13:43.757 --> 13:47.392
First, you are going to stay
exactly who you are.

13:47.394 --> 13:49.327
What else?

13:50.463 --> 13:51.996
I don't think lucas will.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.104
So, i wanted to make sure
you were tied up

14:00.106 --> 14:01.806
Because i know
how you were in texas

14:01.807 --> 14:03.507
And i was worried about
what would happen
when you found out

14:03.510 --> 14:05.777
About what someone was doing
to riley and got angry.

14:07.047 --> 14:09.047
Did i do the right thing, zay?

14:09.049 --> 14:10.565
No.

14:10.566 --> 14:12.082
-What did i do wrong?
-Well, you used towels.

14:13.019 --> 14:16.054
-What should i have used?
-Ah, it wouldn't matter.

14:19.426 --> 14:22.060
Well, look at dat.

14:29.736 --> 14:32.570
It's been my experience
that when it comes to
protecting his friends,

14:32.572 --> 14:34.539
Nothing can hold him back.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.045
Okay.
This oughta hold him.

14:47.687 --> 14:49.621
Why would you
not tell me about this?

14:49.623 --> 14:52.123
I should be able to
fight my own battles, lucas.

14:52.125 --> 14:54.559
No, you shouldn't.
And you don't have to, riley.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.327
That's the point
of having friends.

14:57.764 --> 14:59.697
And did you really think there
was anything you could put

14:59.699 --> 15:01.432
In this window to keep
me from helping you?

15:01.434 --> 15:03.601
We don't like it
when you get like this.

15:03.603 --> 15:05.336
Tell him, maya.

15:05.337 --> 15:07.070
Um... Lucas, pick up
that bed with one arm.

15:11.444 --> 15:13.578
Riley, you wouldn't let me keep
this kind of stuff to myself.

15:13.580 --> 15:14.679
You think we're
gonna let you?

15:18.818 --> 15:22.153
So what? You guys just
come through the window
and that's okay?

15:22.155 --> 15:24.155
I don't like it.
Impolite.

15:24.157 --> 15:25.556
Oh, and i took some cereal.

15:27.661 --> 15:29.827
You're out of milk...

15:29.829 --> 15:31.095
Now.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.699
I don't think it's right
that riley's always

15:34.701 --> 15:36.167
The first one
to come help us

15:36.169 --> 15:37.402
But doesn't come to us
when she needs help.

15:37.404 --> 15:39.237
Okay. I'm sorry.

15:39.239 --> 15:40.722
I should have told you.

15:40.723 --> 15:42.206
I just didn't want
to put this on you.

15:42.208 --> 15:44.842
We're friends.
We can figure out anything.

15:44.844 --> 15:48.246
-But what if you're
dealing with someone who--
-(phone dings)

15:50.850 --> 15:53.151
Who just won't stop?

16:00.593 --> 16:02.193
I want to talk to you.

16:03.663 --> 16:05.330
I know there's
something going on.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.299
Do you want me to
tell you what it is?

16:08.301 --> 16:10.268
Do you want to, riley?

16:11.604 --> 16:14.305
Because so far,
you haven't told me,

16:14.307 --> 16:16.140
And i respect that.

16:17.177 --> 16:18.810
It ain't good.

16:18.812 --> 16:20.678
Yeah, i figured.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.213
But you're on it?

16:22.215 --> 16:23.815
Yes.

16:23.817 --> 16:25.483
And you're on it?

16:25.485 --> 16:27.518
Yep.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.153
The right way?

16:29.155 --> 16:31.255
We'll see.

16:31.257 --> 16:33.491
Cory:
The right way, lucas.
You know why?

16:33.493 --> 16:36.794
Because aaron burr might
have won his duel by
killing his rival,

16:36.796 --> 16:38.696
But he never
held office again

16:38.698 --> 16:41.265
And he'll forever
be known for this.

16:41.267 --> 16:42.834
You understand?

16:42.836 --> 16:44.569
Yes, sir.

16:44.571 --> 16:46.270
Farkle?

16:46.272 --> 16:48.940
Everything will
be okay, mr. Matthews.
It always is.

16:48.942 --> 16:51.242
Yeah, why do you suppose
it always is?

16:51.244 --> 16:53.211
Zay?

16:54.914 --> 16:56.481
It's on the board.

16:56.483 --> 16:58.349
The first one.

16:59.919 --> 17:02.086
That's right.

17:02.087 --> 17:04.254
And then you're going to
tell us about the second one.

17:04.257 --> 17:05.723
I am.

17:05.725 --> 17:07.859
Yeah, i know how this goes.

17:09.329 --> 17:11.262
There's nothing more
valuable than friends

17:11.264 --> 17:12.730
When you have to
go through life.

17:12.732 --> 17:14.732
Cory:
But even if your friends
aren't around,

17:14.734 --> 17:16.300
Even if you're all alone,

17:16.302 --> 17:18.369
There's always
someone to turn to.

17:18.371 --> 17:21.372
A parent or a teacher.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.674
It's okay to ask for help.

17:24.878 --> 17:26.944
That's because there's
so much out there

17:26.946 --> 17:29.380
That makes it's way
to you guys so much easier now.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.916
How do we fight that?

17:31.918 --> 17:34.385
Well, now we turn to growth.

17:35.355 --> 17:36.888
Rely on each other.

17:36.890 --> 17:38.623
Grow together.

17:38.625 --> 17:41.626
But sometimes you have to
grow by yourself.

17:41.628 --> 17:44.829
But whatever it is
that makes its way to you,

17:44.831 --> 17:47.665
It's just shadows
from your intimidating world.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.934
Don't live in the shadow.

17:50.870 --> 17:53.371
Your growth can help you
get back into the sun.

17:53.373 --> 17:55.373
Thanks, dad.

17:56.309 --> 17:58.910
Sarah, darby,

17:58.912 --> 18:01.379
Jade, yindra, wyatt,

18:01.381 --> 18:03.848
Jeffrey, haley,

18:03.850 --> 18:08.419
Nate, yogi,
dave, clarissa,

18:08.421 --> 18:10.421
I know there are lots of
groups of friends in here

18:10.423 --> 18:12.924
And i know you guys
go through stuff, too.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.494
Your math teacher
helps you guys out, right?

18:17.697 --> 18:19.664
And relates algebra
to your lives?

18:20.700 --> 18:22.433
You guys okay?

18:24.571 --> 18:26.471
Learn from each other.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.307
Continue to grow.

18:30.577 --> 18:32.910
And always know that
i'm here for you.

18:34.481 --> 18:37.381
(bell rings)

18:59.472 --> 19:01.339
I know what
mr. Matthews says is right,

19:01.341 --> 19:02.840
But, riley,
if you want me to,

19:02.842 --> 19:04.909
Whoever this is,
i will take care
of it for you.

19:04.911 --> 19:07.345
Thank you, lucas. No.

19:07.347 --> 19:08.479
Riley and i got this.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.081
Thank you, maya. No.

19:11.017 --> 19:14.619
Okay, good. You're gonna
face this one down, but how?

19:16.990 --> 19:18.623
You know what she sent me?

19:19.559 --> 19:22.793
A video of me
being goofy...

19:22.795 --> 19:24.629
Doing the stuff that i do.

19:26.099 --> 19:27.732
She's been filming me...

19:27.734 --> 19:30.401
And now she says she's gonna
send it to the whole school.

19:30.403 --> 19:32.336
Honey, i hate to
break it to you,

19:32.338 --> 19:33.771
But the whole school
already knows you're goofy.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.506
They don't know
everything i do.

19:35.508 --> 19:36.641
Neither do you, maya.

19:36.643 --> 19:38.376
What? No-- yes, i do.

19:38.378 --> 19:40.778
Deep in the heart
of rileytown,

19:40.780 --> 19:43.447
In the darkest secret corner
of rileytown...

19:43.449 --> 19:46.017
I can't believe
i'm finally telling you.

19:46.019 --> 19:47.852
Once a week...

19:47.854 --> 19:49.620
On friday afternoons...

19:49.622 --> 19:51.489
When the halls are empty...

19:51.491 --> 19:54.725
I have an awards ceremony.

19:54.727 --> 19:56.827
I think we know
what happened.

19:56.829 --> 19:59.163
Somebody caught you...

19:59.164 --> 20:01.498
And that's what she's sending
to the whole school.

20:01.501 --> 20:02.833
Well, maybe it's not so bad--

20:02.835 --> 20:05.102
Sometimes i pretend
i'm not there to accept,

20:05.104 --> 20:06.737
So sometimes french riley
accepts in my place.

20:06.739 --> 20:08.372
It's bad. It's really bad.

20:10.109 --> 20:11.742
<i>Bonjour.</i>

20:13.513 --> 20:15.413
Somebody doesn't love this?

20:17.150 --> 20:18.449
What do i do, maya?

20:21.521 --> 20:22.987
Uh...

20:24.557 --> 20:25.823
You look at your friends...

20:27.026 --> 20:28.559
And you realize that

20:28.561 --> 20:31.729
No matter how deep
into rileytown you go,

20:33.466 --> 20:34.565
We'll all be
right behind you.

20:37.070 --> 20:38.436
Now go get her.

20:51.951 --> 20:53.417
Thank you for meeting me.

20:54.487 --> 20:56.187
I know you probably have
something to say.

20:56.189 --> 20:58.155
You always have
something to say.

21:02.028 --> 21:03.561
But now,
it's my turn to talk.

21:04.998 --> 21:06.497
You need to listen.

21:06.499 --> 21:08.532
You need to watch.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.702
Welcome to rileytown.

21:14.507 --> 21:16.474
I twirl around when i'm happy.

21:19.512 --> 21:21.545
I dance by myself.

21:25.184 --> 21:26.784
Because that's who i am.

21:27.887 --> 21:30.721
And if i do something good,
i give awards to myself

21:30.723 --> 21:32.790
So that maybe
i'll do something good again.

21:34.527 --> 21:35.760
And you're
not going to stop me

21:35.762 --> 21:37.595
By showing everybody
your little video

21:37.597 --> 21:39.030
That shows everybody
that i do it

21:40.133 --> 21:41.866
Because i'm going to
show everybody right now.

21:49.709 --> 21:51.942
Welcome back to
the riley awards.

21:53.079 --> 21:56.947
And now, your host,
british riley!

21:56.949 --> 21:59.116
Hi, british riley.

21:59.118 --> 22:02.987
(speaking with british accent)
and now, the biggest award
of the evening.

22:04.557 --> 22:07.792
This here award is
for not only facing your fear,

22:07.794 --> 22:11.696
But doing it in front
of everybody you know
in my awful accent.

22:14.901 --> 22:16.534
And the winner is...

22:17.837 --> 22:18.969
Riley!

22:22.675 --> 22:24.909
(in normal voice)
i'd like to thank everybody
who helped me get here...

22:26.546 --> 22:27.578
My friends.

22:29.082 --> 22:31.148
Because true friends
let you be who you are.

22:36.189 --> 22:37.822
I'd also like to thank you.

22:40.293 --> 22:41.792
Because this was hard.

22:43.663 --> 22:44.929
But i've grown today.

22:45.832 --> 22:47.164
So, thank you.

22:48.668 --> 22:51.135
Hey, where are you going?

22:54.207 --> 22:56.173
Look, riles,

22:56.175 --> 22:57.942
The farther away she goes,

22:57.944 --> 22:59.543
The smaller she gets.

23:08.688 --> 23:09.920
We did good.

23:09.922 --> 23:12.590
Friendship and growth.

23:12.592 --> 23:14.325
What comes next?

23:14.327 --> 23:16.127
I don't know,

23:16.129 --> 23:19.130
But whatever it is,
i know you'll handle it.

23:23.236 --> 23:25.903
Here we are at the
riley awards after party,

23:25.905 --> 23:28.205
Where we've been
having ice cream.

23:28.207 --> 23:30.207
Because i challenged
maya to a duel,

23:30.209 --> 23:31.842
And then i ice creamed her,

23:31.844 --> 23:33.611
And then she said
she'd get me back,

23:33.613 --> 23:35.045
And i'd never see it coming?

23:35.047 --> 23:36.747
Is that why
we're having ice cream?
