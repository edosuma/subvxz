<i>LIV: Previously on iZombie...</i>

00:02.628 --> 00:04.210
<i>CLIVE: All three victims
shot in the head.</i>

00:04.421 --> 00:06.663
They were killed because
they were zombies.

00:06.882 --> 00:07.872
OFFICER: Seattle PD.

00:08.090 --> 00:09.081
I'm not the only one who knew

00:09.301 --> 00:10.257
I had brain eaters
living next door.

00:10.469 --> 00:11.926
See? Message board.

00:12.137 --> 00:15.050
<i>MAJOR: I promised Natalie I'd be the
first thing she saw when she defrosted.</i>

00:15.349 --> 00:17.511
I need to find her before
things go south for me.

00:17.726 --> 00:19.137
- How long do I have?
- Weeks.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.720
I've developed a serum
that could potentially undo

00:21.939 --> 00:25.057
the memory loss that accompanies
the second zombie cure.

00:27.194 --> 00:29.436
The way we left things,
I didn't think you...

00:29.655 --> 00:30.270
Don't!

00:33.909 --> 00:36.117
So, Doc. How's my ticker?

00:38.247 --> 00:39.033
Deafening.

00:41.750 --> 00:45.369
Well, you don't appear poised
to shuffle off this mortal coil.

00:46.713 --> 00:47.703
That makes one of us.

00:49.258 --> 00:50.214
(WATER FIZZING)

00:50.425 --> 00:52.087
The bad news is,

00:52.302 --> 00:54.294
all the memories you lost
when you took the cure

00:54.513 --> 00:56.596
that turned you
from a zombie back to human?

00:57.349 --> 00:59.762
None of them were restored by
the serum you took yesterday.

01:02.020 --> 01:04.227
That's not the worst bad news,
from where I sit.

01:05.274 --> 01:06.515
Granted.

01:06.692 --> 01:08.274
But as you know,
my other zombie patients

01:08.485 --> 01:09.896
would prefer
to keep their memories.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.653
So, how long before we know for
sure whether the serum works?

01:12.864 --> 01:14.196
Could be a few days.

01:14.783 --> 01:16.240
Now, if you wake up
Saturday morning

01:16.451 --> 01:18.113
and there's still been
no change,

01:18.328 --> 01:20.570
I'd be confident the serum
is completely ineffective.

01:20.789 --> 01:22.781
- And completely non-lethal.
- Mmm.

01:23.000 --> 01:23.831
All right.

01:24.376 --> 01:26.868
I'm setting this
for 6:00 a.m. Saturday.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.333
- I'll let you know ASAP.
- Noon will be fine.

01:31.633 --> 01:32.669
Meantime,

01:33.218 --> 01:35.050
you should find someone
to keep an eye on you.

01:35.262 --> 01:37.970
In case things take
a sudden turn for the worse.

01:38.181 --> 01:39.137
LIV: Morning, boys.

01:39.766 --> 01:41.473
- Any old memories yet?
- BLAINE: Not yet.

01:41.685 --> 01:43.096
It's still too soon.

01:43.312 --> 01:45.224
Hey, thanks for coming out
to the show last night.

01:45.439 --> 01:47.806
And for only yelling
"Freebird!" like, a dozen times.

01:48.025 --> 01:49.857
Yeah, nice set.

01:50.068 --> 01:52.526
Too bad this 24-hour party
person couldn't make it.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.024
Next time, Doc.

01:57.492 --> 01:59.154
Rough night, eh, playa?

01:59.369 --> 02:01.736
Please keep your rebuke
to a dull roar.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.696
Oh, I'll let God
be your judge.

02:04.708 --> 02:06.495
But let's review the facts,
shall we?

02:07.210 --> 02:08.997
First, you tell Peyton
that you're in love with her,

02:09.211 --> 02:11.454
leaving her confused
and speechless,

02:11.673 --> 02:13.255
and then you take home
your old boss

02:13.467 --> 02:14.924
for a drunken hate-bonk.

02:15.135 --> 02:19.095
And when Peyton shows up to say that she's
ready to take a chance on Pavi or Rayton

02:19.306 --> 02:21.343
or whatever it is that you two
would call yourselves,

02:21.558 --> 02:22.719
you kiss her,

02:22.934 --> 02:25.267
while your latest conquest is
in the next room.

02:25.687 --> 02:26.643
Not good.

02:27.397 --> 02:28.353
I know.

02:28.565 --> 02:29.476
Also,

02:29.983 --> 02:33.602
I believe God is a woman,
so, you're really screwed.

02:38.742 --> 02:41.450
Did you hear about Yolanda's
on-site with Dr. Klein?

02:41.662 --> 02:44.154
I heard she sold him a dozen
CAD/CAM Intraoral Scanners.

02:44.373 --> 02:47.992
Honestly? From what I heard
about how Yolanda closed,

02:48.210 --> 02:51.169
teeth aren't the only thing
that Dr. Klein likes to drill.

02:53.423 --> 02:55.210
Hey, you kids hear the latest
on Rolf's green card?

02:55.425 --> 02:57.542
- Did it finally get approved?
- I doubt it.

02:57.761 --> 03:00.469
You know how Rolf's been telling
everybody that he's Austrian?

03:02.349 --> 03:05.638
Well, it turns out
his grandfather was German.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.849
(SOFTLY) Very German.

03:11.149 --> 03:13.607
Make sure the camera
gets your good side.

03:13.819 --> 03:15.902
Oh, and save an everything
for Felicia.

03:16.113 --> 03:19.026
She's off her
gluten-free diet... Again.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.367
D'you know
how Ron got his limp?

03:26.790 --> 03:28.406
I didn't even know
he had a limp, Cheryl.

03:28.709 --> 03:31.201
- Then you're gonna love this. Supposedly...

if you wanna live!

03:37.968 --> 03:38.754
Come on!

03:46.560 --> 03:47.596
Yup, yup.

03:48.645 --> 03:50.261
That fire alarm is
probably gonna be

03:50.480 --> 03:52.688
the most exciting thing
that happens today.

03:53.984 --> 03:56.567
Unless Earl comes by
to pick up my quarterlies.

03:57.904 --> 03:59.236
Felicia!

03:59.448 --> 04:01.440
- You're so bad!
- Yeah!

04:01.658 --> 04:03.741
Tell you what else I'd like
to have Earl pick up.

04:06.913 --> 04:07.994
Cheryl?

04:11.793 --> 04:13.000
Swear to God, Cheryl.

04:13.211 --> 04:16.625
My feelings about Earl
do not leave this room.

04:16.839 --> 04:17.750
You hear me?

04:18.925 --> 04:19.880

that on the office toilet.

05:01.885 --> 05:03.717
One more reason
to telecommute.

05:04.387 --> 05:06.219
Victim's name is
Cheryl Warren.

05:06.431 --> 05:08.013
Single, age 39.

05:08.225 --> 05:10.012
Top salesperson at Dentelco,

05:10.227 --> 05:12.344
the Northwest's leading
dental equipment supplier.

05:12.562 --> 05:16.226
Lab results show her death was
caused by yogurt spiked with Utopium,

05:16.441 --> 05:19.900
which reacted to deadly effect with
Cheryl's prescription anti-depressants.

05:20.111 --> 05:21.397
Well, no suicide note,

05:21.613 --> 05:23.696
and she'd just booked
a vacation to Hawaii.

05:23.907 --> 05:26.445
Could be what we're looking at
here is an office prank gone wrong.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.822
Someone slipped Utopium
in her yogurt as a joke?

05:29.037 --> 05:30.153
A security cam
picked up Cheryl

05:30.372 --> 05:31.908
removing the sealed
yogurt container

05:32.123 --> 05:34.706
from the office fridge
at 11:09 a.m.

05:34.918 --> 05:37.001
Witnesses say she walked
straight to her desk

05:37.212 --> 05:38.544
and started eating the yogurt.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.166
But the tox results show

05:40.382 --> 05:41.918
that the Utopium-laced yogurt
that killed her

05:42.133 --> 05:44.466
was ingested
a full 30 minutes after.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.214
She took a half an hour
to eat a yogurt?

05:46.429 --> 05:49.092
Well, she was interrupted
by an unscheduled fire alarm.

05:49.307 --> 05:52.266
Triggered at 11:13 by
a pull-box on the fifth floor,

05:52.477 --> 05:54.764
where Cheryl and the other
sales associates worked.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.471
Employees exited the building,

05:56.690 --> 06:00.024
remaining outside
until the all-clear, at 11:38.

06:00.235 --> 06:01.351
So, working theory?

06:01.570 --> 06:03.903
A fifth-floor coworker pulled
the fire alarm as a diversion?

06:04.114 --> 06:05.446
Right.
Then spiked Cheryl's yogurt

06:05.657 --> 06:07.239
when everyone else
had cleared out.

06:07.450 --> 06:09.908
I'll start bringing in
all the fifth-floor employees.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.406
I'll eat Cheryl brain.

06:12.122 --> 06:15.240
I'll wait for you to go Willy
Loman and depress me further.

of the liquid

is equal to the pressure

I should go in your place.

complete and total memory loss.

It won't be long
before you have an episode

07:47.676 --> 07:49.087
too severe
for that inhaler to help.

You keep it somewhere
you can get to it.

08:00.855 --> 08:02.972

who ate the canary's brain.

It's just...

08:05.652 --> 08:06.813
Blaine and Peyton.

08:07.028 --> 08:09.190
I saw them duck into the alley
last night after his set.

08:09.406 --> 08:10.066
No.

08:10.407 --> 08:12.319
They were out there
for quite a while.

08:12.534 --> 08:13.570
Doing what?

08:14.411 --> 08:15.197
You tell me.

08:24.713 --> 08:25.703
Hey.

08:25.922 --> 08:27.038
I was just thinking about you.

08:27.215 --> 08:29.298
Well, that can't be the best
use of taxpayer dollars.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.045
I was doing it pro bono.

08:32.303 --> 08:33.009
What's up?

08:33.513 --> 08:35.220
I was just wondering...

08:35.432 --> 08:38.095
What are you doing between
now and Saturday morning?

08:45.942 --> 08:48.434
Here's the latest
on the Tuttle-Reid murders.

08:48.903 --> 08:52.067
I printed all
the zombie-related comments

08:52.282 --> 08:54.114
from that
online message board.

08:54.909 --> 08:56.150
Here's your half.

08:57.287 --> 08:58.903
Yeah, I'll get right on that.

09:03.126 --> 09:06.119
What do you think Cavanaugh and
Devore are talking about in there?

09:06.337 --> 09:07.703
Probably the same thing
we are,

09:07.922 --> 09:09.129
the Tuttle-Reid murders.

09:09.758 --> 09:10.373
Oh.

09:11.259 --> 09:12.966
We need to
go through these ASAP.

09:13.178 --> 09:14.635
Anybody who's been
on that message board

09:14.846 --> 09:16.587
would have reason
to believe that...

09:18.975 --> 09:20.511
Wally's family were zombies,

09:20.727 --> 09:22.468
and would have known
where the family lived.

seem particularly murderous.

Okay, Dentelco's

You ready to get into this?

09:37.118 --> 09:39.405
You're sure that's what
they're talking about in there?

09:40.288 --> 09:42.996
Then what's with Devore
wearing a padded bra today?

09:46.211 --> 09:47.668
What the hell is up with you?

09:47.879 --> 09:49.666
The thing you should know
right off the top,

09:49.881 --> 09:51.372
Cheryl was a huge gossip.

09:52.884 --> 09:54.716
- Ah...
- There it is.

09:54.928 --> 09:57.466
Just the worst,
God rest her soul.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.262
An absolute nightmare.

09:59.474 --> 10:01.340
If she wasn't such
a tremendous salesperson,

10:01.559 --> 10:03.642
we would have let her go
long ago.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.765
But those big ears
and loose lips of hers

10:05.980 --> 10:06.970
caused all kinds of trouble.

10:07.190 --> 10:08.055
Such as?

10:08.274 --> 10:11.438
Complaints from other sales
associates, which I had to document.

10:11.653 --> 10:15.522
Reprimands from HR,
which I had to write.

10:15.740 --> 10:16.947
Could we take a look at those?

10:17.158 --> 10:17.818
Sure.

for seven years.

10:32.841 --> 10:35.549
And you worked in the cubicle
right next to Cheryl for...

10:35.760 --> 10:38.047
- The past five.
- Must've been tough.

10:38.847 --> 10:41.555
Especially when she spread
the word about your affair.

10:41.766 --> 10:44.509
With a dental hygienist
named Todd.

10:44.727 --> 10:45.968
Thanks to Cheryl's gossiping,

10:46.187 --> 10:48.144
your wife found out
about Todd,

10:48.356 --> 10:50.643
then divorced you and took
your kids to Virginia Beach.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.567
His ex moved to Virginia.
(WHISPERS) She's with the FBI.

10:55.029 --> 10:56.895
But I wasn't mad at Cheryl.

10:57.782 --> 10:59.694
Actually relieved
to be done living a lie.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.320
Still, your desk puts you
in the perfect spot

11:01.536 --> 11:03.949
to doctor Cheryl's yogurt
during the hubbub,

11:04.164 --> 11:05.450
just after the fire alarm
went off.

11:05.623 --> 11:06.830
I was the first one
out the door,

11:07.041 --> 11:09.124
and the first to make it
to the gathering spot.

11:09.335 --> 11:10.746
I'm sure your coworkers
can confirm that.

11:11.921 --> 11:14.755
Did you happen to notice who
was last to the gathering spot?

11:14.966 --> 11:17.174
- Pretty sure it was Pete.
- Ooh.

11:17.385 --> 11:18.375
Pete!

We hear you were the last one out
of the building after the fire alarm.

11:23.266 --> 11:24.848
I was on the phone.
A sales call.

11:25.059 --> 11:28.302
- So, you weren't in the kitchen stealing food?
- No.

11:28.521 --> 11:31.059
I guess you stopped doing that
after Cheryl complained so much

11:31.274 --> 11:32.810
about her food being stolen

11:33.026 --> 11:35.268
that HR installed
a kitchen security cam.

11:35.486 --> 11:38.570
The one that caught you
in flagrante yogurt-o.

11:38.781 --> 11:41.865
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) That all started
when I ate one string-cheese of Cheryl's

11:42.076 --> 11:43.738
a couple of years ago.
Honest mistake.

11:43.953 --> 11:46.195
But she made
such a big deal about it

11:46.414 --> 11:47.746
that I just kept
stealing her food.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.539
Tell me about this sales call.

11:49.751 --> 11:52.164
My numbers were down.
It would've been huge.

to pull the trigger.

Ravi, it's a stakeout,
all right?

13:23.511 --> 13:24.672
We'll hunker down in my car.

All right, here's a problem.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.302
It's okay. You can tell me.

14:11.517 --> 14:14.305
When the alarm went off,
I was in the bathroom. Alone.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.762
I came out and I saw Jim
running for the stairs.

14:16.981 --> 14:19.348
- He yelled for me to follow.
- So, Jim could vouch for you?

14:19.567 --> 14:22.526
That's right. We went right downstairs
and out to the gathering spot.

14:22.737 --> 14:24.524
Rhonda saw us.
She was already there.

You're saying she wasn't in the

14:31.412 --> 14:34.371
Maybe Rhonda had
a better place to be.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.116
I was at the coffee shop.

I heard the fire alarm go off when
I was walking back into the building.

14:49.931 --> 14:52.014
So, you went to the gathering
spot. Who'd you see there?

14:52.225 --> 14:54.512
Jim and Vicky. They got
there before anyone else.

14:56.479 --> 14:57.595
Um...

14:57.814 --> 14:59.931
I'm afraid I have to ask,
Rhonda,

15:00.149 --> 15:01.890
on the matter of motive.

We...

That's the kind of gal
she was.

So, you were
understandably angry.

you think it's the first time

16:05.506 --> 16:06.792
He's got a wife and kids.

16:07.008 --> 16:08.920
I doubt he'd have
his mistress living here.

in a second location

16:11.596 --> 16:13.883

lead us to.

23:33.495 --> 23:35.612
to Cheryl-caught-me-
abusing-sick-days Vicky.

23:35.831 --> 23:37.788
The minute
before the alarm went off.

23:38.417 --> 23:39.578
Let's bring 'em in.

23:40.085 --> 23:41.872
Ask 'em what that's about.

23:43.881 --> 23:45.292
What am I looking at here?

23:45.507 --> 23:47.123
That binder contains
all the texts

23:47.343 --> 23:49.209
sent on Dentelco phones
this month.

23:49.428 --> 23:52.671
The one we've circled is
one you received from Jim.

23:52.890 --> 23:54.006
Okay.

23:54.224 --> 23:55.260
Jim and I text a lot.

23:55.476 --> 23:57.934
It came in one minute before
the fire alarm was pulled.

23:58.145 --> 24:01.729
The entire text is a single
exclamation point. What was that about?

24:01.941 --> 24:03.557
You said you were
in a bathroom at the time.

24:04.109 --> 24:05.475
Oh...

24:05.694 --> 24:08.311
You know, that's just
this thing me and Jim do.

24:08.530 --> 24:10.237
We send each other
an exclamation point

24:10.449 --> 24:11.530
when we see something funny.

24:11.742 --> 24:14.735
I read a lot of texts between you
and Jim over the past few weeks,

24:14.954 --> 24:16.911
but this was
the first exclamation point.

24:17.122 --> 24:18.488
You sure this wasn't a signal?

24:20.417 --> 24:21.953
Just one question, Jim.

24:22.753 --> 24:26.417
The exclamation point you texted
Vicky, what was that about?

24:30.135 --> 24:31.251
Um...

24:32.805 --> 24:35.138
That must've been a butt dial.

24:45.275 --> 24:46.607
I'm still trying
to piece together

24:46.819 --> 24:48.651
exactly what went down
with Jim and Vicky.

24:48.862 --> 24:50.854
Those two were up to
something. That's for sure.

24:51.073 --> 24:52.439
I like them for pulling
the fire alarm

24:52.658 --> 24:54.149
and slipping Cheryl
the Utopium,

24:54.368 --> 24:56.234
<i>but I can't figure
how they could've done that</i>

24:56.453 --> 24:58.365
and been the first ones
to leave the building.

25:03.502 --> 25:04.834
Oh, my.

25:05.045 --> 25:06.832
<i>You will not believe
what I'm looking at.</i>

25:09.008 --> 25:11.341
<i>CHERYL: Rhonda was in pornos!
I kid you not.</i>

25:11.552 --> 25:12.633
<i>VICKY: No!</i>

25:13.762 --> 25:17.221
I suppose I could put you
on retainer, Mr. Racy.

25:19.184 --> 25:22.848
But I would prefer you put me
on your very large...

25:23.522 --> 25:24.854
(EXHALES)

25:25.065 --> 25:27.057
Clive! I just had a vision!

25:27.276 --> 25:29.484
Let me double-check something
and I'll call you right back.

25:32.114 --> 25:34.106
We need to find
a Rhonda Hardbody porno

25:34.324 --> 25:36.782
where she plays a private
eye's sexy Italian client.

25:38.245 --> 25:39.031
Why not?

25:39.246 --> 25:40.657
I've got nothing better to do.

25:41.331 --> 25:42.617
It's one of the movies
on this list.

25:42.833 --> 25:44.449
Focus on the crime thrillers.

25:44.668 --> 25:47.126
So, ignore remakes
of classics, such as

25:47.337 --> 25:50.000
<i>The Magnificent Seven-Way,
Bone-Hur...</i>

25:50.215 --> 25:52.207
No doubt part of the
Criterion Hard-Core Collection.

25:52.426 --> 25:53.633
If you're not up to it...

25:54.178 --> 25:55.294
I'll muddle through.

25:55.512 --> 25:58.220
You see,
I believe in justice, Liv.

25:59.808 --> 26:01.015
(SCOFFS)

26:02.352 --> 26:04.014
I always thought
I'd go for cremation.

26:05.272 --> 26:06.604
But this ain't so bad.

26:07.733 --> 26:09.645
What if I tortured animals
as a kid?

26:09.860 --> 26:10.976
Um...

26:12.362 --> 26:14.945
They say a lot of killers
do that when they're kids.

26:16.492 --> 26:17.573
I'm sure you didn't.

26:17.785 --> 26:18.946
What if my memory comes back,

26:19.161 --> 26:21.153
and I just see stuff that
I'm unequipped to deal with?

26:21.371 --> 26:22.578
That's not the Blaine I know.

26:23.373 --> 26:24.864
You can't just
assume the worst.

26:25.167 --> 26:27.250
Yeah, well, the Blaine
you knew killed people.

26:27.753 --> 26:28.618
Okay, and behavior like that

26:28.837 --> 26:30.169
just doesn't
come out of the blue.

26:30.964 --> 26:33.047
A few of those people probably
begged for their lives.

26:34.051 --> 26:36.293
Maybe you'll find
some good memories in there.

26:38.180 --> 26:39.842
People you loved
who loved you back.

26:40.057 --> 26:42.595
You've taken the warped
tour, Peyton. You met my dad.

26:43.393 --> 26:45.476
You got an inkling of what
my childhood was like.

26:46.563 --> 26:47.644
You get what
you're hoping for,

26:47.856 --> 26:48.812
and I'll get back
all the memories

26:49.024 --> 26:50.811
that led me to becoming
a murdering brain-dealer.

26:51.777 --> 26:53.018
Or, maybe...

26:54.613 --> 26:56.400
Maybe your memories come back,

26:56.573 --> 26:59.862
but you stay this new and
improved version of Blaine.

27:01.245 --> 27:02.326
A boy can hope.

27:06.625 --> 27:07.786
(MUSIC PLAYING IN BACKGROUND)

27:08.001 --> 27:11.369
Okay, next thing we need to do
is pound these breasts.

27:11.588 --> 27:13.580
What did that poor chicken
ever do to you?

27:13.799 --> 27:15.916
It crossed the road. And me.

27:16.135 --> 27:17.467
- Now it's payback time.
- (CHUCKLES)

27:18.345 --> 27:19.927
LIV: Hey, you two.

27:20.139 --> 27:21.175
What's happening?

27:22.015 --> 27:24.007
Chicken cordon bleu,
that's what.

27:24.226 --> 27:25.387
PEYTON: Wanna get in on it?

27:25.602 --> 27:27.059
<i>We bought enough pour toi.</i>

27:27.271 --> 27:28.853
<i>Oh, in that case, merci.</i>

27:29.064 --> 27:31.477
<i>But first, I must visit
your salle de bain.</i>

27:34.444 --> 27:36.185
So, is he remembering stuff?

27:37.406 --> 27:38.522
Still nothing.

27:38.740 --> 27:41.232
You realize if he doesn't get
something soon, I'm gonna stay like this

27:41.451 --> 27:42.737
and the Major we know
will disappear.

27:43.745 --> 27:44.826
I know.

27:45.414 --> 27:46.029
I hope so.

27:47.291 --> 27:50.455
Starting to wonder if you've lost
sight of the big picture here.

27:53.755 --> 27:55.166
CLIVE: What do you two
want to show me?

27:57.593 --> 28:02.304
Rhonda in the role
of Lady Effamia Duro,

28:02.514 --> 28:05.382
looking for her husband's
killer, in the hard-boiled,

28:05.601 --> 28:07.217
triple-X thriller,

28:08.562 --> 28:09.769
<i>Hump Me Deadly.</i>

28:10.981 --> 28:12.597
Does she play it
with an Italian accent?

28:12.816 --> 28:15.149
(CHUCKLES) And then some.

28:15.861 --> 28:17.352
I found it after going
through her porn-noirs.

28:17.571 --> 28:20.279
<i>The All-Tease Phallus...
Farewell, My Lusty...</i>

28:20.490 --> 28:22.857
<i>- Dial "M" for Moisture...
- Okay, I get it.</i>

28:23.076 --> 28:24.612
Sorry for making you watch
all those.

28:24.828 --> 28:26.364
A welcome diversion.

28:26.955 --> 28:28.867
I may have become
Rhonda Hardbody's biggest fan.

28:30.083 --> 28:31.574
And here's
Georgina's sales call.

28:31.752 --> 28:34.210
<i>WOMAN: (ON RECORDING) I like the
Ergo-Matic's price point, Pete,</i>

28:34.421 --> 28:36.333
<i>but how does it compare
feature-wise</i>

28:36.548 --> 28:37.914
<i>to the Royal Brougham?</i>

28:38.133 --> 28:40.716
And here's Lady Effamia.

28:40.928 --> 28:42.214
- Right.

28:42.429 --> 28:46.139
<i>RHONDA: I suppose I could
put you on retainer, Mr. Racy.</i>

28:46.975 --> 28:52.312
<i>But I would prefer you put me
on your very large desk.</i>

28:53.315 --> 28:54.647
The voices match.

28:54.858 --> 28:56.099
Yeah. If she didn't show up
in your records,

28:56.318 --> 28:58.401
she was probably
using a burner phone.

28:58.904 --> 29:00.645
Does this mean you'll be
bringing Rhonda back in again?

29:01.031 --> 29:02.693
Would asking for an autograph
be out of bounds?

29:03.575 --> 29:04.986
Who doesn't look guilty here?

29:05.869 --> 29:07.576
We need blueprints
for the building.

29:16.004 --> 29:18.087
It wasn't easy
to crack this one...

29:18.298 --> 29:20.711
until I took a look
at the Dentelco floor plans.

29:22.010 --> 29:23.626
You all had solid alibis.

29:23.845 --> 29:26.178
Rhonda, you were out of
the office on a coffee run.

29:26.765 --> 29:28.882
Jim, you were leading
everyone to the gathering spot

29:29.101 --> 29:30.137
and getting there first.

29:30.686 --> 29:33.394
Vicky, you were in the
bathroom, then with Jim.

29:33.605 --> 29:36.393
But we finally figured out
how the prank went down.

29:36.608 --> 29:39.567
<i>Starting with Cheryl making it
to her desk with her yogurt.</i>

29:40.195 --> 29:41.982
<i>Jim clocks her
opening the foil.</i>

29:42.572 --> 29:44.689
<i>That would've been key
to make this plan work.</i>

29:45.367 --> 29:47.905
<i>He sends Vicky
the exclamation point text.</i>

29:48.120 --> 29:50.828
<i>- (CELL PHONE CHIMES)

<i>That's the cue for Jim
to act like a hero.</i>

Don't panic, people!

29:55.836 --> 29:57.077
Come with me

30:00.924 --> 30:03.086
<i>and follows her coworkers

30:03.302 --> 30:06.170
Meanwhile, Jim's with Vicky
in the women's bathroom,

30:06.388 --> 30:08.095
<i>waiting for
the coast to clear,</i>

30:08.307 --> 30:09.798

equipment savvy

<i>And which still operates even

Which enables them to race to the
gathering spot ahead of the others

making their way down
five flights of steps,

30:53.769 --> 30:55.180
and be vouched for by you,

30:55.771 --> 30:57.979
who resented Cheryl
for outing your porn career.

30:58.190 --> 30:59.306
Who wanted to
get back at Cheryl

30:59.524 --> 31:01.186
for torpedoing your promotion.

31:01.401 --> 31:04.394
Who wanted payback
for her ruining your marriage.

Now, if you wanna see
more of your kids,

31:07.366 --> 31:09.323
maybe you wanna make a deal
on a manslaughter rap.

If so, I advise you
to step right up.

31:13.205 --> 31:15.037
I only need one of you
to confirm the facts.

Or maybe you'll all decide
to stick to your story.

In which case, you'd
better hope we don't find

31:19.878 --> 31:22.621

the charge to murder one.

31:25.759 --> 31:26.624

None of us imagined
she would die.

31:32.599 --> 31:34.215
We were all in on it.

31:34.434 --> 31:37.097
Vicky recruited me and Rhonda
after a team-building seminar.

31:37.312 --> 31:38.519
Rhonda got the Utopium.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.687

screwed up our lives.

a taste of her own medicine.

31:44.236 --> 31:46.319
Now, we're gonna
spend years in prison.

31:46.530 --> 31:49.238
She managed to screw us even
worse from beyond the grave.

31:52.119 --> 31:54.657
Just wait till I tell Felicia
in HR.

Oh, my God, Major.

Sir, can you come with me?

33:11.948 --> 33:12.688
Why did you come here?

33:29.090 --> 33:30.877
And where do you propose I go?

33:31.092 --> 33:33.084
Okay, I know a place. It's
an organized group of zombies.

33:33.303 --> 33:34.839
They can protect you from
Oates and provide you brains.

33:35.055 --> 33:37.672
You don't get it, Major.
Seattle doesn't work.

33:37.891 --> 33:39.678
This man,
he will hunt me down.

33:39.893 --> 33:41.725
So, unless your group of
zombies has offices

33:41.937 --> 33:44.429
in Sri Lanka or the
Amalfi Coast, I can't go.

33:44.648 --> 33:46.389
- I can't walk away and leave you here.
- I agree.

33:46.608 --> 33:48.565
You can't walk away.
You need to run.

33:49.361 --> 33:51.694
You have no idea what he'll
do to you if he finds you here.

33:52.322 --> 33:53.654
Oh, I have a pretty good idea.

(SIGHS)

34:02.541 --> 34:03.873
Don't worry,

34:04.084 --> 34:06.201
I'll figure a way out of this.

34:06.419 --> 34:08.284
- Some day.
- I left you once.

anymore.

You can go anywhere
you've ever dreamed of.

34:27.107 --> 34:28.393
I... I'll be human again?

34:31.152 --> 34:32.938
That's wonderful, Major.

34:33.405 --> 34:34.190
Oh, my God!

34:35.239 --> 34:37.322
After a couple of days,

34:38.243 --> 34:40.235
the memories of your life
and your loved ones,

34:40.453 --> 34:41.534
they'll all start to fade.

34:43.248 --> 34:46.661
Eventually, you won't remember
anyone or anything.

34:47.752 --> 34:49.583
You'll be starting life
as a new person.

34:52.674 --> 34:53.414
Oh.

34:57.262 --> 34:58.628
Please go, Major.

35:10.066 --> 35:12.274
So, tomorrow morning
you'll be in the clear.

35:12.485 --> 35:15.819
Ravi says if I'm gonna get back
any memories, it'll happen by then.

35:16.990 --> 35:18.276
I'm sorry.

35:20.577 --> 35:22.364
I want Liv and Major
to be human again.

35:23.830 --> 35:25.992
I think I've kinda gotten used
to them being zombies.

35:26.958 --> 35:28.665
But I'm not the one
who has to eat brains.

35:28.877 --> 35:29.913
Hey,

35:31.004 --> 35:31.835
I get it.

35:32.255 --> 35:33.166
I know.

35:35.634 --> 35:38.502
Which is why I'm so friggin'
attracted to this...

35:38.720 --> 35:40.256
This version of you.

35:41.890 --> 35:43.426
But what if we wake up
tomorrow morning

35:43.642 --> 35:46.726
and that other Blaine is back?

35:46.936 --> 35:50.395
I've been thinking about that
a lot and... I don't know.

35:50.607 --> 35:52.439
Yeah. Me, neither.

35:55.320 --> 35:56.481
What I do know is,

35:58.198 --> 36:01.316
if this is my last night
to spend with this Blaine...

36:04.454 --> 36:05.945
I don't wanna waste it.

36:18.134 --> 36:19.215
Me, neither.

36:27.185 --> 36:28.471
Okay...

36:28.687 --> 36:30.019
Okay, okay, okay, okay...

36:30.230 --> 36:31.266
Okay, okay, okay, okay...

36:31.481 --> 36:33.564
All right, all right,
all right.

36:33.775 --> 36:36.017
So, here's the thing, and I
can't believe I'm saying this,

36:36.236 --> 36:38.023
I really, really can't,
but, um...

36:40.115 --> 36:41.902
Do you think
maybe we should wait?

36:43.910 --> 36:44.570
Yeah.

36:45.870 --> 36:47.031
Yeah, we should.

36:47.247 --> 36:48.328
No, we definitely should.

36:49.666 --> 36:52.374
If we do anything and tomorrow
you're a different guy?

36:52.585 --> 36:53.575
Yeah, the old guy?

36:53.837 --> 36:55.044
The guy that would
never suggest we wait?

36:55.255 --> 36:57.497
Yeah. If you're him tomorrow,
I'm gonna hate myself.

36:57.716 --> 36:58.797
I would, too.

36:59.008 --> 37:01.216
Except I'd be him.
So, I wouldn't.

37:06.725 --> 37:08.682
ZACK: All right, people,
Kevlar up!

37:09.394 --> 37:11.101
This is not a drill!

37:11.312 --> 37:12.723
This is the real deal!

37:12.939 --> 37:14.396
With real bullets!

37:14.607 --> 37:16.894
So, let's make sure they
do not leave you real dead!

37:38.715 --> 37:41.207
I found an interesting post
from a zombie-hater.

37:41.426 --> 37:43.759
And I'm finding
my share of those, too.

37:43.970 --> 37:45.336
Harley Johns.

37:45.555 --> 37:47.922
His online signature links
to a local gun range.

37:48.141 --> 37:49.006
Check it out.

37:55.440 --> 37:58.524
We're just in time for their
Zombie Apocalypse Special.

38:07.327 --> 38:09.319
(ALARM RINGING ON CELL PHONE)

38:14.000 --> 38:17.243
Am I dreaming, or is there a
beautiful woman watching over me?

38:18.588 --> 38:19.374
Sorry.

38:20.173 --> 38:21.254
I couldn't sleep.

38:21.466 --> 38:23.082
I guess if I was dreaming,

38:23.843 --> 38:25.379
you'd be holding coffee.

38:29.933 --> 38:31.970
So? What's the word?

38:34.270 --> 38:35.135
Nothing.

38:35.355 --> 38:36.266
(EXHALES)

38:39.067 --> 38:41.480
I'm sorry about what this
means for your friends.

38:42.278 --> 38:43.485
I'll start on that coffee.

38:43.696 --> 38:44.686
How do you take...

39:06.719 --> 39:07.800
(GUNSHOTS)

39:16.396 --> 39:18.103
CLIVE: Excuse me, Mr. Johns?

39:22.527 --> 39:23.938
Mr. Johns!

39:25.321 --> 39:26.778
I thought I smelled something.

39:28.157 --> 39:30.399
Oh, right on, white power.

39:30.618 --> 39:33.281
I'm Dr. Moore, with
the Medical Examiner's office.

39:34.122 --> 39:37.741
And I'm Detective Babineaux,
SPD homicide.

39:38.710 --> 39:40.167
Hey, be my guest.

39:40.503 --> 39:41.994
It's a bit more weapon
than you're used to,

39:42.213 --> 39:44.125
the sight's a little off,
but you seem like a big boy...

39:48.636 --> 39:49.342
Not bad.

39:49.596 --> 39:50.632
Sight seems fine.

39:51.764 --> 39:55.053
We had a few questions about
something you posted online.

39:55.268 --> 39:57.555
"Online." Online where?

39:57.770 --> 39:59.227
You see,
my interests run the gamut

39:59.439 --> 40:01.726
from full-auto
firearm conversions

40:01.941 --> 40:03.603
to the Sovereign
Citizen Movement.

40:03.818 --> 40:06.401
This was a message board
where someone claimed to live

40:06.613 --> 40:10.357
next door to a family of...
Zombies.

40:11.492 --> 40:13.358
It included a helpful map
to their house.

40:13.578 --> 40:15.035
The family was murdered,
you know.

40:15.496 --> 40:16.327
Yeah, I heard about that.

40:16.539 --> 40:17.996
The day before,
you posted that you were

40:18.207 --> 40:20.449
"Itching to put some bullets
to good use,"

40:21.252 --> 40:23.209
"perforating
a brain-eater's skull."

40:23.421 --> 40:25.333
Well, it is on my bucket list.

40:27.091 --> 40:29.629
However, at the time
of the incident in question,

40:29.844 --> 40:31.210
I was with my family.

40:31.429 --> 40:32.419
Klan rally?

40:33.890 --> 40:35.256
We prefer the term "picnic."

40:37.435 --> 40:41.054
Listen, I don't know if those
dead folks were zombies or not,

40:41.272 --> 40:42.934
but I do know this...

40:43.149 --> 40:44.981
Zombies are real.

40:45.818 --> 40:48.105
They exist right here
in Seattle,

40:48.321 --> 40:49.482
right under our noses.

40:51.532 --> 40:52.898
What makes you say that?

40:53.117 --> 40:55.109
My brother Dave showed me
a photo of a zombie.

40:55.662 --> 40:56.493
It was gnarly.

40:58.247 --> 41:01.581
Like him. You know,
just without all the holes.

41:02.627 --> 41:04.163
Can we see the photo?

41:04.379 --> 41:05.620
Sorry.

41:05.838 --> 41:06.919
My bro took it to the grave.

41:11.803 --> 41:14.216
This good man was killed
by zombies.

41:15.556 --> 41:18.094
The official story is, he died
in the Max Rager massacre.

41:19.143 --> 41:20.634
I'm sorry for your loss.

41:20.853 --> 41:21.969
Thanks for your help.

41:27.902 --> 41:30.269
That was the lab technician
whose severed arm we used

41:30.488 --> 41:32.150
to access
the Max Rager basement.

41:32.365 --> 41:33.481
I know.

41:33.700 --> 41:35.942
It means this Harley character
is no ordinary nut-job.

41:36.160 --> 41:37.492
He knows there are zombies.

41:37.704 --> 41:38.694
Hey!

41:40.248 --> 41:41.705
If I ever run into their kind,

41:42.458 --> 41:45.201
what I do about it
won't be your concern.

41:45.753 --> 41:46.834
Why's that?

41:47.588 --> 41:48.920
'Cause you can't murder
what ain't alive.
