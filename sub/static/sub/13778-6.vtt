WEBVTT

00:04.546 --> 00:05.877
(line rings)

00:05.923 --> 00:07.538
(voice mail) You've reached
Detective Luke Callaghan.

00:07.591 --> 00:09.297
Please leave a message
after the beep.

00:09.343 --> 00:10.423
(beep)

00:10.469 --> 00:11.754
Uh, hi, Luke. It's me.

00:11.803 --> 00:14.089
Um, I guess we should probably talk.

00:14.139 --> 00:17.848
It's been a couple of days,
and not that I'm a "Rules" girl,

00:17.893 --> 00:21.260
but, uh, you know, it's starting
to feel kinda weird, so——

00:21.313 --> 00:22.928
Uh, I know things
are complicated for you,

00:22.981 --> 00:24.892
and you're probably just trying
to figure stuff out, and...

00:26.818 --> 00:28.354
just call me, all right?

00:28.403 --> 00:30.735
We really need to decide
what we're gonna do next.

00:31.907 --> 00:32.771
(beep)

00:39.957 --> 00:41.993
Okay, yeah.
Thank you for calling.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.327
All right, bye.
(beep)

00:43.377 --> 00:45.208
— Hey.
— Hey.

00:45.254 --> 00:48.087
When were you
at the Edinboro Hotel?

00:49.216 --> 00:50.171
Why?

00:50.217 --> 00:52.128
You left your credit card there.

00:52.177 --> 00:55.669
Well, maybe you can
pick it up for me

00:55.722 --> 00:57.303
when you go
for your day at the spa.

00:57.349 --> 00:59.089
— Seriously?
— Surprise.

00:59.142 --> 01:00.803
(water running)
— What?

01:00.852 --> 01:02.558
That is so nice of you.

01:02.604 --> 01:05.311
l——l feel really bad, actually.

01:05.357 --> 01:06.847
I should be getting you something,

01:06.900 --> 01:09.277
since it's your first day back on the job.

01:13.323 --> 01:14.733
Let's get married.

01:14.783 --> 01:16.899
Uh, we are.

01:16.952 --> 01:19.409
Yeah, I don't want to wait.

01:19.454 --> 01:21.536
Let's go to City Hall next week.

01:21.582 --> 01:24.540
We'll throw a big party aftenNards.
What do you think?

01:24.585 --> 01:27.167
Well, I think the girl in me says
I don't have a dress.

01:27.212 --> 01:30.796
Okay, let's get one. Come on.

01:30.841 --> 01:32.081
— Are you okay?
— Yeah.

01:32.134 --> 01:33.715
l'm great.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.045
| just don't want to wait anymore.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.882
Okay. Yeah. What the hell?

01:37.931 --> 01:39.546
— Sure. Let's do it.
— Mm.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.716
— Mm.
— Mm—hmm.

01:41.768 --> 01:44.601
— Ooh, let's get married.
— (laughs)

01:44.646 --> 01:47.308
(siren wails)
J‘ Ohh J‘

01:47.357 --> 01:49.018
J‘ Now, now J‘

01:49.067 --> 01:52.059
Next week?
Let me try that again.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.443
Next week?!

01:53.488 --> 01:55.069
I knew he was gearing up
for something.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.106
He went to the cabin on Friday night,
and when he got back,

01:57.159 --> 01:59.366
just, it was obvious
something was on his mind.

01:59.411 --> 02:02.574
And then flowers and dinners,
spa packages.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.363
So where are you doing it?
Have you told anyone?

02:04.416 --> 02:06.532
No. No, no, no, no.
We're keeping this very small, quiet.

02:06.585 --> 02:08.371
Okay, my dad's outta town,

02:08.420 --> 02:11.833
so it's just gonna be the four of us——
me, you, Luke and Jerry.

02:11.882 --> 02:13.292
You're gonna be
my maid of honor, right?

02:13.342 --> 02:15.082
— I wouldn't miss it.
— Okay, good.

02:16.803 --> 02:18.088
Hey. What are you guys doing?

02:18.138 --> 02:19.753
Oh, just cleaning up
the place a bit.

02:19.806 --> 02:22.468
Make it look a little less,
you know, murdery.

02:22.517 --> 02:24.508
You all good, Gail?
Can I get you anything?

02:24.561 --> 02:25.596
(Dov) Gail's had paralysis

02:25.646 --> 02:27.728
ever since she found out her mom
was coming in tonight.

02:27.773 --> 02:29.934
Superintendent Elaine Peck.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.268
(Chris) Supernice lady.

02:31.318 --> 02:32.649
You don't know her.

02:32.694 --> 02:34.559
Yeah, we had Sunday dinner,
like, a month ago.

02:34.613 --> 02:35.693
She was really great.

02:35.739 --> 02:37.195
She kept calling you Craig.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.572
— (Traci laughs)
— Craig's a great name.

02:42.079 --> 02:44.286
Well, at least we now know how
to make the demon flee——

02:44.331 --> 02:46.162
speak the name of thy life—giver.

02:48.960 --> 02:50.575
"Open City, Open House!"

02:50.629 --> 02:52.244
— (laughter)
— (Frank) Save it.

02:52.297 --> 02:54.629
Brass upstairs wants us
to interface with the community,

02:54.675 --> 02:56.506
that's what we do.
There'll be a lot of press,

02:56.551 --> 02:58.212
community leaders,
political types,

02:58.261 --> 03:02.004
so I want you all to be here
cleaned up 1900 hours.

03:02.057 --> 03:03.297
Diaz.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.011
— (clears throat)
— Now apparently,

03:05.060 --> 03:09.554
Superintendent Elaine Peck
will be joining us tonight as well.

03:09.606 --> 03:11.471
I'm hoping that, um,

03:11.525 --> 03:13.732
you know, she'll——
she'll like what she sees.

03:13.777 --> 03:17.110
This is the first one of these
for me as staff sergeant,

03:17.155 --> 03:20.488
so I want you guys to look sharp,
you know, be sharp.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.695
Now keep your noses clean
today,okay?

03:22.744 --> 03:24.325
Make me look good out there.

03:24.371 --> 03:27.078
(chatter)

03:27.124 --> 03:30.582
Why are you so happy?

03:30.627 --> 03:33.289
Oh, don't tell me.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.954
You're jazzed about the open house.

03:36.007 --> 03:39.170
My 6—year—old gets to see
where I work, and he's excited.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.925
So he gets excited, I get excited.

03:40.971 --> 03:42.552
It's an all—around exciting day.

03:42.597 --> 03:44.212
I guess he thinks,
like everybody else,

03:44.266 --> 03:46.473
we play with plastic guns
and yell, "Stick 'em up"?

03:46.518 --> 03:48.133
I just think it's cool——

03:48.186 --> 03:50.768
opening doors and letting people
see what it is we really do.

03:50.814 --> 03:51.929
You know what tonight's gonna be?

03:51.982 --> 03:54.189
A bunch of little old ladies
getting fingerprinted for fun,

03:54.234 --> 03:55.474
and a bunch of little kids

03:55.527 --> 03:57.483
getting souvenir mug shots
for the fridge.

03:57.529 --> 03:59.611
Nobody actually wants to know
what we really do.

03:59.656 --> 04:01.863
Nobody really wants to know
how the sausages get made.

04:01.908 --> 04:03.239
(gun clicks)

04:03.285 --> 04:05.992
Are they seriously doing
souvenir mug shots?

04:06.037 --> 04:07.743
Leo would actually really love that.

04:07.789 --> 04:10.371
Whoa. Sam, buddy.

04:10.417 --> 04:11.372
— Uh—oh.
— Mm—hmm?

04:11.418 --> 04:12.373
Oh, no, uh,

04:12.419 --> 04:13.625
just a bit of an uh—oh.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.206
You know my informant,
Marco Forlan?

04:15.255 --> 04:17.621
Testifying—against—
the—Jameson—gang Marco Forlan?

04:17.674 --> 04:19.835
Yeah. I can't find him.

04:19.885 --> 04:21.546
What do you mean?
You lost him?

04:21.595 --> 04:26.009
No, I didn't lose him. ljust——
|——| can't find him.

04:26.057 --> 04:28.434
Look, he refused protective custody.

04:28.477 --> 04:30.433
You know, he's a Church Street
party boy. It's not my fault.

04:30.479 --> 04:32.435
(sighs) It's a hell of a day
to lose your informant.

04:33.023 --> 04:34.183
I know.

04:34.232 --> 04:36.564
Do you have a last address?
Maybe we can do a drive—by.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.726
No, |——That's the thing.
|——| don't have anything.

04:38.779 --> 04:43.489
And now the prosecutor wants
to meet before the trial,

04:43.533 --> 04:45.398
and |——| don't have the star——

04:45.452 --> 04:46.658
— (cell phone chirps)
— Okay, hold on.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.279
Oh.

04:50.332 --> 04:53.119
It's okay. We found him.

04:53.168 --> 04:55.955
Yeah. Yeah, look,
Forlan wouldn't stay put.

04:56.004 --> 04:57.414
He refused custody.

04:58.799 --> 04:59.914
No, I know.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.298
Yeah. No, |——| know.

05:02.344 --> 05:04.209
Believe me,
we're doing the best we can.

05:04.262 --> 05:05.672
(beep)

05:05.722 --> 05:08.555
Thanks, buddy.
You're really making my day.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.592
Okay, I'm gonna need you guys
to look around for witnesses.

05:11.645 --> 05:14.057
That means alleyways,
side streets, everything.

05:14.105 --> 05:15.094
Sure.

05:16.233 --> 05:17.814
Jerry, I think we got something.

05:17.859 --> 05:18.848
(Oliver) McNally?

05:18.902 --> 05:20.187
A witness was in the restaurant,

05:20.237 --> 05:21.818
heard firecracker sounds
and breaking glass,

05:21.863 --> 05:24.275
looked outside, and saw a red two—door
fleeing the scene.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.734
Yeah. Thought it could've been
a black male driving,

05:25.784 --> 05:27.115
but she couldn't be sure.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.400
Okay, well, was there
a make or a model?

05:28.453 --> 05:30.034
We got partial plates.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.911
Yeah, ran 'em.
Uh, three hits.

05:31.957 --> 05:34.039
One's registered
to a Kylie Penrose.

05:34.084 --> 05:36.996
She's not black or male,
but girl's got a rap sheet——

05:37.045 --> 05:39.957
soliciting, drug possession,
and——wait for it——

05:40.006 --> 05:42.088
boys in Vice told us...

05:42.133 --> 05:43.259
she's hooking for the Jamesons.

05:43.301 --> 05:44.632
Oh.

05:44.678 --> 05:45.884
Yeah, buddy.

05:45.929 --> 05:48.170
Looks like Forlan
is gonna help us out.

05:48.223 --> 05:49.303
Thank you.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.101
(camera shutter clicks)

05:55.146 --> 05:56.556
So?

05:56.606 --> 05:58.722
Cause of death——three gunshot wounds
to the head.

05:58.775 --> 06:00.106
Yeah, sharp as always.

06:00.151 --> 06:01.812
That's not what I meant.

06:03.446 --> 06:05.653
(sighs) It was a mistake.

06:05.699 --> 06:06.779
(shutter click)
What?

06:06.825 --> 06:08.907
l'm engaged. I'm happy.

06:08.952 --> 06:10.488
Never should've happened.

06:10.537 --> 06:11.868
(chk)
That's the story?

06:11.913 --> 06:12.868
That's what you're telling yourself?

06:12.914 --> 06:14.745
It's the truth.

06:14.791 --> 06:17.032
So what now? We just
never talk about it again?

06:17.085 --> 06:18.495
That's it?

06:18.545 --> 06:20.627
I'll take the coroner.
You take the witnesses.

06:27.762 --> 06:30.549
What are you looking at?
I thought that went great.

06:33.518 --> 06:34.928
— What's your mom doing here?
- (gaerS)

06:34.978 --> 06:37.060
Psych! Totally got you.

06:37.105 --> 06:38.470
You are such a loser.

06:38.523 --> 06:39.478
What's the big deal?

06:39.524 --> 06:40.559
If my mom was superintendent,

06:40.609 --> 06:41.974
I'd be detective by now.

06:42.027 --> 06:44.894
Yeah. If my mom was your mom,
you'd be gay.

06:48.700 --> 06:49.906
(cans rattle)
— Dov.

06:49.951 --> 06:51.361
(rattling continues)

06:52.621 --> 06:55.954
Police. Come out of there now.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.010
(Traci) You haven't driven
your car today?

07:11.056 --> 07:12.011
(woman) No.

07:12.057 --> 07:13.922
— So then who did?
— No idea.

07:13.975 --> 07:16.307
Kylie, someone drove your car today.

07:16.353 --> 07:17.513
Well, then someone must've stolen it,

07:17.562 --> 07:18.722
because I've been home all morning.

07:18.772 --> 07:19.887
Oh, stole it and then brought it back?

07:19.940 --> 07:21.146
'Cause it's right there.

07:21.191 --> 07:22.146
That'd be very considerate of them.

07:22.192 --> 07:23.773
(police radio chatter)

07:23.818 --> 07:25.399
Maybe your boyfriend took it?

07:25.445 --> 07:27.231
My boyfriend's out of town,
all week.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.020
— He's not your boyfriend.
— Shut up, Deena.

07:29.074 --> 07:30.905
He's nobody's boyfriend.
He's a pimp.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.111
(Sam) Uh, Deena, right?

07:32.160 --> 07:33.661
Can I use your bathroom?

07:33.703 --> 07:35.489
Uh, no. Oh.

07:35.538 --> 07:37.995
— (Kylie) What is he doing?
— It's just great in here.

07:38.041 --> 07:39.406
I love what you've done
with the place.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.541
Um, that's not even the way
to the bathroom.

07:41.586 --> 07:43.702
Sorry. I got kinda
turned around in here.

07:43.755 --> 07:45.586
What the hell is he doing?
He's not allowed to be in there.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.168
Sit down.

07:47.217 --> 07:48.753
— How old are you?
— She's 19.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.338
| asked her.

07:50.387 --> 07:51.752
(Deena) I don't think
I've done anything wrong.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.591
Officer Swarek, I think
we might have a problem.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.722
I think Deena here
might be underage.

08:01.064 --> 08:03.225
Thank you, Officer Nash,
but, uh...

08:04.651 --> 08:08.143
I think we might have
a slightly bigger problem,

08:08.196 --> 08:11.154
especially if this gun
killed our witness.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.405
(Frank) We're thinking the girls
are the shooters?

08:16.454 --> 08:18.069
(Noelle) No way. Jamesons keep
their pretty girls

08:18.123 --> 08:20.455
working in other areas.
But according to the landlord,

08:20.500 --> 08:22.081
this is the guy
who pays their bills——

08:22.127 --> 08:25.039
Darrell Jameson——pimp,
gunrunner, family enforcer.

08:25.088 --> 08:28.171
Forlan had a lot to say about
the guy. Darrell must've heard.

08:28.216 --> 08:29.376
Where's Darrell?

08:29.426 --> 08:31.041
Sam's out looking for him.

08:31.094 --> 08:33.335
He knows a guy who knows a guy.
We find Darrell,

08:33.388 --> 08:35.424
connect the girls with the gun,
we're good to go.

08:35.473 --> 08:37.009
What about the kid in the box?

08:37.058 --> 08:38.969
Um, he hasn't said anything
since we brought him in.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.384
Well, he better
start talking fast.

08:40.437 --> 08:42.268
You need to get
on top of things before...

08:42.313 --> 08:44.725
How do you set up
a conference call on this thing?

08:44.774 --> 08:46.981
All I did was press
a couple of buttons,

08:47.027 --> 08:49.439
and now I think
the whole division's on hold.

08:49.487 --> 08:50.943
(hangs up receiver, sighs)

08:50.989 --> 08:52.945
I lost my BlackBerry,
fifth one this month,

08:52.991 --> 08:54.106
second one this week.

08:54.159 --> 08:55.899
My office is yours,
Superintendent.

08:55.952 --> 08:57.032
You know that.

08:57.078 --> 08:58.943
Our office needs
an air freshener.

08:58.997 --> 09:00.533
You need me
to help you dial out?

09:00.582 --> 09:03.164
I need you to tell me
how to tell the chief

09:03.209 --> 09:07.168
that we lost a major witness
in an upcoming gang trial.

09:07.213 --> 09:08.669
I mean, today, of all days.

09:08.715 --> 09:12.173
Uh, we do have two
known accomplices in custody.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.504
(Frank) We have detectives
canvassing the city.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.260
We're completely
on top of things.

09:16.306 --> 09:17.591
(snores)

09:22.479 --> 09:24.185
Frankie, I know what——

09:24.230 --> 09:27.188
You get the bad guys,
and I'll make it sound good.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.189
— We'll get it done.
— I know you will,

09:29.235 --> 09:31.647
because there is
no other option, is there?

09:33.073 --> 09:36.941
Now do you mind if I steal
my sweetheart for a second?

09:38.661 --> 09:40.197
You're as quiet as a mouse.

09:40.246 --> 09:41.201
(Gail) Mm.

09:41.247 --> 09:42.236
(Elaine) Hmm?

09:44.209 --> 09:45.449
"Frankie"?

09:45.502 --> 09:48.209
I'm just glad she's on our side...

09:48.254 --> 09:49.960
I think.

09:51.132 --> 09:52.212
This is you.

09:52.258 --> 09:54.340
(lock clicks)

09:54.385 --> 09:56.762
Hey, can I have some water, please?

09:56.805 --> 09:58.215
(door buzzes, beeps)

09:58.264 --> 10:01.631
We'll, uh, hold the girls
for 24 hours.

10:01.684 --> 10:02.969
Resisting arrest.

10:03.019 --> 10:04.225
Gun's at ballistics.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.726
Is there a warrant
I'm not aware of?

10:05.772 --> 10:07.558
Well, Sam said the gun
was in plain view.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.598
ln plain—view plain view

10:09.651 --> 10:12.358
or a plain—view—for—Sam?

10:12.403 --> 10:14.610
Yes.

10:14.656 --> 10:17.568
— Okay. What are we doing?
— We're hunting.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.983
We go after the weakest member
of the pack. It's Deena.

10:20.036 --> 10:21.321
You want me to get Callaghan?

10:21.371 --> 10:24.113
Actually, uh, I'll take McNally.

10:24.165 --> 10:26.121
Eh, give the girl
someone to relate to.

10:29.546 --> 10:31.036
(door closes)

10:33.883 --> 10:35.965
(Elaine) Smile.

10:36.010 --> 10:38.217
Bit bigger.

10:38.263 --> 10:40.845
Less. We're not going
for scary here.

10:40.890 --> 10:42.141
Which button do | press?

10:42.183 --> 10:43.423
The one with the camera on it.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.591
(phone camera shutter clicks)

10:44.644 --> 10:48.136
Hmm. Okay.
E—mail it to your father.

10:48.189 --> 10:49.929
He's forgotten
what you look like.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.689
Speaking of what you look like——

10:51.734 --> 10:53.019
Ohh. Are we done?

10:53.069 --> 10:54.775
Well, I don't know, Gail.
You tell me.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.186
You haven't impressed me so far.

10:56.239 --> 10:57.695
Oh, okay.
Well, then let's do it.

10:57.740 --> 10:58.695
When you were a rookie,

10:58.741 --> 11:00.527
you broke the record
for collars. I know,

11:00.577 --> 11:02.317
because I dusted the trophies,
l shined your medals.

11:02.370 --> 11:05.032
| just don't want you
to look up 20 years from now,

11:05.081 --> 11:06.912
married to some Okie
from Muskogee

11:06.958 --> 11:08.494
who's still on
the doughnut patrol and wonder,

11:08.543 --> 11:09.953
"How the hell did I get here,

11:10.003 --> 11:12.039
"and why didn't
my mother push me

11:12.088 --> 11:14.921
just when I needed
to be pushed the most?"

11:17.135 --> 11:18.921
Anyway...

11:18.970 --> 11:21.086
I'm gonna be doing interviews

11:21.139 --> 11:23.050
tonight at this Open House thing,

11:26.728 --> 11:29.686
two generations
of Peck policing.

11:29.731 --> 11:31.096
— Sound good?
— Yeah.

11:31.149 --> 11:33.982
— Sounds great.
— Okay.

11:34.027 --> 11:38.441
You know, we should actually
do something about your hair.

11:38.489 --> 11:41.401
Come on, son. You can——You can
talk to us. We're the police.

11:41.451 --> 11:43.442
You know, the——
We're the police.

11:43.494 --> 11:45.701
He's a kid, not an alien.

11:45.747 --> 11:49.080
A really cool kid.
Isn't that right? Huh? Up high.

11:49.125 --> 11:52.117
Come on. I said, "Up high."
Come on. Gimme five.

11:52.170 --> 11:53.580
— Hey, Elaine.
— No?

11:53.630 --> 11:56.167
I mean,
Superintendent Elaine, uh, Peck.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.753
Superintendent,
Officer Dov Epstein. Pleasure.

11:58.801 --> 12:00.086
— The meth lab bust.
— Hmm.

12:00.136 --> 12:01.842
Outstanding work, Officer.

12:01.888 --> 12:03.549
Excellent initiative.

12:03.598 --> 12:05.259
Is this your witness?

12:05.308 --> 12:07.765
Yeah, so we should probably
just get back to work.

12:07.810 --> 12:08.936
What do you have so far?

12:08.978 --> 12:10.093
I'm making excellent progress.

12:10.146 --> 12:12.888
Nothing, ma'am.
No. Not a word.

12:12.941 --> 12:14.431
Officer Cool Kid
isn't really working.

12:14.484 --> 12:15.849
lt'd help if I had some backup.

12:15.902 --> 12:17.392
It would help if you were cool.
Mom, I got this.

12:17.445 --> 12:20.278
Shh. l'm great with kids.

12:22.825 --> 12:25.441
Did you see...

12:25.495 --> 12:27.486
the bad man?

12:27.538 --> 12:29.665
Pow! Pow!

12:29.707 --> 12:31.163
There's your answer.

12:31.209 --> 12:33.575
Call Children's Aid.
You're done with him.

12:33.628 --> 12:34.583
It's nice working with you boys.

12:34.629 --> 12:35.618
(Dov chuckles)

12:40.051 --> 12:41.791
I'm just gonna go over.

12:41.844 --> 12:44.711
I gotta say, your mother,
excellent judge of character

12:44.764 --> 12:47.005
and surprisingly good
with children.

12:47.058 --> 12:48.013
Hey. Okay,
I'm gonna take you——

12:48.059 --> 12:50.721
(speaks Russian)

12:52.230 --> 12:54.642
Well, why didn't you say so
in the first place?

12:54.691 --> 12:57.182
So, uh...

12:57.235 --> 13:00.102
is this the room where you get
all the confessions and stuff?

13:00.154 --> 13:01.314
Sometimes.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.901
Could we talk about this morning?

13:05.952 --> 13:07.112
What about it?

13:07.161 --> 13:08.742
Whose gun is it?

13:08.788 --> 13:09.777
Where'd it come from?

13:10.957 --> 13:11.912
No idea.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.243
We know about Darrell.

13:13.293 --> 13:16.080
We know who he is
and what he makes you do.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.586
Darrell doesn't make me
do anything. I do it for us.

13:18.631 --> 13:19.791
"Us"?

13:19.841 --> 13:22.833
Me and Darrell.
We love each other.

13:22.885 --> 13:25.968
We're actually
getting a place together,

13:26.014 --> 13:27.424
you know, one of those condos
that they're building

13:27.473 --> 13:28.462
down by the lake, the new ones?

13:28.516 --> 13:29.551
Mm—hmm.

13:29.600 --> 13:30.760
We were actually
there last week,

13:30.810 --> 13:31.845
and we were picking out
kitchen tiles.

13:31.894 --> 13:34.385
And I like
the little glass ones,

13:34.439 --> 13:37.272
but he's more of a limestone kinda guy, so——
(door release buzzes, beeps)

13:37.317 --> 13:39.774
Officer McNally,
I'd like a second with Deena.

13:45.241 --> 13:46.902
(door release buzzes, beeps)

13:50.330 --> 13:51.410
— (Jo) Got a record here.
— (Andy) Hey.

13:51.456 --> 13:53.162
Hey.

13:53.207 --> 13:55.334
— How's your first day back?
— (chuckles)

13:55.376 --> 13:58.118
Lucky you. You got to see me get
kicked out of my own interview.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.833
Yeah, don't take it personally.
She has her own rhythm.

14:00.882 --> 14:02.418
(buzzer sounds in distance)

14:02.467 --> 14:04.378
So...

14:04.427 --> 14:06.713
Darrell Jameson.
We already know what happened.

14:06.763 --> 14:09.095
He borrowed Kylie's car,
he went out,

14:09.140 --> 14:11.506
shot a guy,
came back to your place,

14:11.559 --> 14:13.891
dropped off the car,
hid the gun.

14:13.936 --> 14:16.552
All we need you to do is confirm it.

14:17.482 --> 14:18.642
Okay.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.479
Mindy Karkanis, 18 years old.

14:22.528 --> 14:25.235
I think Mindy was from Oakville.

14:25.281 --> 14:28.773
Megan Stanheight, 17.
I don't know where Megan was from.

14:28.826 --> 14:29.781
What are you doing?

14:29.827 --> 14:32.204
Just showing you some of
Darrell's last few girlfriends.

14:33.498 --> 14:35.989
No. lt——

14:36.042 --> 14:37.282
(sighs) There's no way.

14:37.335 --> 14:38.575
He wouldn't actually do that, so...

14:38.628 --> 14:42.086
Bad johns, bad dope, bad luck.

14:42.131 --> 14:44.508
This is the life
Darrell is gonna give you.

14:44.550 --> 14:45.835
This is where it leads.

14:46.719 --> 14:47.708
What do you mean?

14:47.762 --> 14:50.344
Well, door number one...

14:50.390 --> 14:53.757
we bust you for the gun,
whatever else we can find,

14:53.810 --> 14:56.597
you get out in a couple of years,
Darrell's moved on,

14:56.646 --> 14:58.807
you end up like one of the girls
in the picture.

14:58.856 --> 15:02.849
Or you tell us what we already know,
we take care of you,

15:02.902 --> 15:05.359
we put you up in a hotel,
we fly you someplace safe.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.020
Then you take it from there.

15:07.073 --> 15:08.813
I mean, you might even have
a chance at a life worth living.

15:13.121 --> 15:15.578
(engine starts,
police radio chatter)

15:15.623 --> 15:17.739
So who are we waiting for?

15:17.792 --> 15:20.784
Lionel Jameson, one of
Darrell's cousins by marriage.

15:20.837 --> 15:21.917
And when's he getting here?

15:21.963 --> 15:23.954
Any minute.
Guy keeps junkie time.

15:24.006 --> 15:26.088
— When's that?
— When it's no—dope o'clock.

15:26.134 --> 15:27.715
— (spits)
— Whoa.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.217
Yeah, you're, uh,
not supposed to drink it.

15:30.263 --> 15:31.093
Ohh.

15:31.139 --> 15:32.424
You can get any drug
you want in there.

15:32.473 --> 15:34.555
What you can't get's
a decent cup of coffee.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.851
Hey, Lionel!

15:41.274 --> 15:42.229
What you want, man?

15:42.275 --> 15:43.264
| just want to talk.

15:43.317 --> 15:45.854
Talk about what? l'm——l'm clean.
I'm not using anything.

15:45.903 --> 15:47.404
That's great news.
What are you doing here?

15:47.447 --> 15:48.857
Uaughs)

15:48.906 --> 15:50.487
I'm going to a coffee shop
to get some coffee.

15:50.533 --> 15:51.568
Have mine.

15:51.617 --> 15:54.199
Look, man, I gotta go, man.
I got places to be, a'ight?

15:54.245 --> 15:55.200
Okay, well, th—that's perfect.

15:55.246 --> 15:56.281
We'll give you a ride.

15:56.330 --> 15:58.491
We can give you a ride.
No problem.

15:58.541 --> 16:01.032
That's right.
Just five minutes.

16:01.085 --> 16:03.292
(door release beeps, handcuffs clank)

16:03.337 --> 16:05.589
— Deena, what's going on?
— They're not letting me go.

16:05.631 --> 16:06.916
lt's entrapment. lt's coercion.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.467
lt's——lt's entrapment
and coercion.

16:08.509 --> 16:09.840
lt's crap! That's what it is.

16:09.886 --> 16:11.001
You have to call Darrell.

16:11.053 --> 16:12.429
You know what?
That's enough.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.713
We'll get you out, sweetie.
I promise.

16:14.765 --> 16:16.630
I said that's enough!

16:16.684 --> 16:18.595
What is coercion anyway?
I heard you say that.

16:18.644 --> 16:19.804
I don't even know what it means.

16:19.854 --> 16:22.186
Deena, you did great.
She bought it.

16:22.231 --> 16:24.483
I know, and it doesn't
really feel very good.

16:24.525 --> 16:26.982
It's okay.
You're doing the right thing.

16:27.028 --> 16:28.438
(Luke) We gotta move quick.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.149
When Darrell finds out
she's not coming back...

16:30.198 --> 16:32.814
So how long
do I gotta stay outta town for?

16:32.867 --> 16:34.778
It could be a while.
You're definitely gonna be safe.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.204
We've got you
on an 8 AM. flight to Halifax.

16:37.246 --> 16:38.531
Someone'll meet you at the airport.

16:38.581 --> 16:39.741
Uh, what do you mean?
Who's meeting me?

16:39.790 --> 16:41.291
We're trying to reach your family.

16:41.334 --> 16:42.744
Uh, not my mom. Don't call her.

16:42.793 --> 16:44.784
Well, Deena,
you have to stay with somebody.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.338
Yeah, but it doesn't
have to be my mom.

16:46.380 --> 16:49.622
We can, um——We can call
my sister and her boyfriend.

16:49.675 --> 16:52.132
They live just outside the city,
and they have a new baby.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.918
It's really cute.
She's just like a doll.

16:53.971 --> 16:57.463
Okay. Yeah, we can do that.
Detective?

16:57.517 --> 16:58.677
After you give your statement,

16:58.726 --> 17:01.638
you and l are gonna go to a motel
outside the airport for the night.

17:01.687 --> 17:04.895
Uh, can you come, too? Please?

17:05.983 --> 17:07.848
No. Sorry. She can't.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.189
Maybe we should get somebody
who's just coming on shift.

17:11.239 --> 17:13.605
It could be a long night.

17:13.658 --> 17:15.148
Would that make you happy?

17:15.201 --> 17:16.441
Yeah.

17:16.494 --> 17:18.530
If that's good with you, McNally.

17:18.579 --> 17:19.989
Sure. Yeah.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.280
We'll make it a girls night.
Could be fun.

17:25.962 --> 17:27.998
(siren wailing)

17:28.047 --> 17:31.710
Okay, McNally, we need to keep
all the, uh, inside doors open

17:31.759 --> 17:33.465
in case we need
to get her outta here fast.

17:33.511 --> 17:34.717
Okay.

17:34.762 --> 17:35.922
How are the sight lines
from the window?

17:35.972 --> 17:37.257
Uh, parking lot, cars,

17:37.306 --> 17:39.217
got a 180—view of the only road.

17:39.267 --> 17:41.007
Good. So we can see
who's approaching,

17:41.060 --> 17:42.095
keep this place secure.

17:42.144 --> 17:43.099
Do l have to sleep on these beds?

17:43.145 --> 17:44.931
The sheets look kinda uggy.

17:46.899 --> 17:49.060
Darrell said that he would
get me Egyptian cotton ones

17:49.110 --> 17:50.850
when we got our place together.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.313
Apparently those are the best.

17:52.363 --> 17:54.604
Okay, well, um,

17:54.657 --> 17:56.067
once we get settled, I'll go out,

17:56.117 --> 17:58.403
see if I can find some sheets
that are less uggy.

17:59.537 --> 18:01.619
(Man) He says
he heard some noise,

18:01.664 --> 18:04.326
but didn't see anybody.

18:04.375 --> 18:06.366
Uh... (speaking Russian)

18:08.963 --> 18:10.419
(speaking Russian)

18:14.135 --> 18:15.671
Okay, he says that, uh,

18:15.720 --> 18:17.460
he doesn't know
his adoptive parents' names.

18:17.513 --> 18:20.630
A big house, something about
a bike they got him.

18:20.683 --> 18:22.344
You ask him how
he got out on the street?

18:22.393 --> 18:24.850
(speaks Russian)

18:24.895 --> 18:26.510
(speaking Russian)

18:30.901 --> 18:32.892
Uh, what he's saying is, um,

18:32.945 --> 18:35.152
he ran away
because they didn't want him

18:35.197 --> 18:36.983
or left him.

18:37.033 --> 18:39.149
I'm not 100%.

18:40.494 --> 18:42.871
You want this?

18:42.913 --> 18:44.824
What is that?

18:44.874 --> 18:46.159
(Gail) Don't touch him.
He'll freak.

18:46.208 --> 18:47.414
Ask him to roll up his sleeve.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.542
(speaks Russian)

18:49.587 --> 18:51.123
(Dov) Now ask him
where he got that.

18:51.172 --> 18:52.628
(speaks Russian)

18:52.673 --> 18:57.007
(speaks Russian)

18:57.053 --> 18:58.338
— (speaks Russian)
— Da.

18:58.387 --> 19:00.548
He says someone tied him up.

19:11.525 --> 19:13.481
You want to get a movie?

19:13.527 --> 19:15.563
City won't spring for it, I will.

19:15.613 --> 19:18.104
I'm fine. All right? I'm okay.

19:20.284 --> 19:21.239
Detective?

19:21.285 --> 19:22.821
She said she's okay.

19:22.870 --> 19:25.862
I'm okay.
I think we're all okay.

19:25.915 --> 19:27.906
(Jo) Don't stand
by the window, Deena.

19:29.919 --> 19:31.500
Did you guys get ahold of my sister?

19:31.545 --> 19:33.877
Uh, she's supposed to pick us up
at the airport, right?

19:33.923 --> 19:35.333
But I know she's working days.

19:35.383 --> 19:36.793
Actually, she said
that's not gonna work out,

19:36.842 --> 19:38.423
but we talked to your mom and——

19:38.469 --> 19:39.879
No. No way.

19:39.929 --> 19:41.965
Deena, we need to get you
someplace safe.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.630
Well, that place
is not with my mom.

19:44.684 --> 19:47.141
I actually think I would
feel better with Darrell.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.552
Yeah, well, your mom's
not trying to kill you.

19:49.605 --> 19:51.641
You know what? I'm outta here.

19:51.691 --> 19:54.398
This was stupid.
This whole thing was just stupid.

19:54.443 --> 19:56.479
No, Deena.
Okay, what do you want?

19:56.529 --> 19:57.735
What can we do?

19:57.780 --> 19:59.816
I want——

19:59.865 --> 20:00.980
I don't want this.

20:02.284 --> 20:03.615
Okay, well, what do you want?

20:03.661 --> 20:05.526
(sighs) I want——

20:06.997 --> 20:10.125
I want to be someplace nice

20:10.167 --> 20:12.249
with people who don't hate me.

20:12.294 --> 20:14.159
Okay, well, this is just for now.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.875
And things'll happen for you.
It'll get better.

20:16.924 --> 20:18.425
VVhen?

20:18.467 --> 20:22.836
Now, 'cause we're gonna get a movie

20:22.888 --> 20:25.971
and——Or, I mean, I can go out
and get some magazines.

20:26.016 --> 20:27.881
What kind of magazines?

20:27.935 --> 20:30.597
Oh, Celebrity magazines or——

20:30.646 --> 20:32.602
I don't know. I can get
some wedding magazines.

20:32.648 --> 20:34.354
I'm getting married
in, like, a week.

20:34.400 --> 20:38.063
l have about a day to pick out
a dress. Want to help me?

20:47.204 --> 20:48.785
(police radio chatter)

20:48.831 --> 20:50.867
(mouth full) Are you sure
you don't want one?

20:50.916 --> 20:53.032
l just——l just need
to get outta here, man.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.461
And you will,
as soon as you tell us

20:54.503 --> 20:55.959
where we can find
your cousin Darrell.

20:56.005 --> 20:57.165
— (Lionel sighs)
— These are actually pretty good, you know,

20:57.214 --> 20:58.715
cold and sweet.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.999
I didn't even know I wanted one
till right this second.

21:01.051 --> 21:04.009
Oh, God. Oh, God. Just——
I'm not feeling too good, man.

21:04.054 --> 21:05.669
Well, maybe you need to score.

21:05.723 --> 21:07.384
I don't do that anymore.
I'm clean, okay?

21:07.433 --> 21:09.014
Hey, I get it. Whatever lie
you need to tell yourself

21:09.059 --> 21:10.185
to get through the day, man.

21:10.227 --> 21:11.933
— It's true, okay, man?
— Great.

21:11.979 --> 21:13.435
I'm really happy for you, buddy. I am.

21:13.481 --> 21:15.017
I don't feel good about this.

21:15.065 --> 21:16.441
— About what?
— (groans)

21:16.484 --> 21:17.940
We're just taking
an old friend for a drive.

21:17.985 --> 21:19.816
Hey, Lionel, when was
the last time you took a ride

21:19.862 --> 21:21.773
out to the country?
'Cause we got all day.

21:21.822 --> 21:24.609
Come on, man! Look,
I don't know anything, okay?

21:24.658 --> 21:26.239
They don't tell me anything anymore.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.116
Come on. You're Darrell's cousin.
He loves you.

21:28.162 --> 21:30.699
Look, dude, I don't know.
They're going legit or something.

21:30.748 --> 21:32.579
That's all they tell me.
I don't know, man.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.161
— Jeez.
— What do you mean, legit?

21:34.210 --> 21:36.451
The dude's buying up, like,
four condos under his mother's name.

21:36.504 --> 21:37.869
Why don't you guys try looking there?

21:37.922 --> 21:39.662
Maybe that's where he's hiding, okay?

21:39.715 --> 21:41.376
I mean, that's where I'd go.
They're pretty sweet.

21:41.425 --> 21:42.961
ln downtown where?

21:43.010 --> 21:44.716
It's by the lake or something.
Man, I swear to God,

21:44.762 --> 21:46.923
that's all I know, guys.
Please just let me out.

21:46.972 --> 21:49.384
Nice work, Officer Nash. Hey.

21:51.018 --> 21:52.929
All right. Nice.

21:55.981 --> 21:57.892
(distant siren wails)

21:57.942 --> 22:00.809
(Elaine) Chief, I told you that we had
everything under control,

22:00.861 --> 22:02.977
and yet still you worried.

22:03.030 --> 22:05.191
l have to say that hurt my feelings,

22:05.241 --> 22:07.857
offended me on a professional level.

22:09.829 --> 22:14.823
Well, my division could use some
new communications equipment.

22:14.875 --> 22:17.161
These phones are
a hundred years old.

22:19.213 --> 22:22.455
Okay. I'll take that
as a compliment.

22:22.508 --> 22:23.918
Ohh.
(coffee splashes)

22:23.968 --> 22:26.425
Craig. Did that hurt?

22:26.470 --> 22:28.802
Uh, no pain here,
superintendent. Just...

22:28.848 --> 22:30.884
Well, good. Could you get me
another cup, then?

22:30.933 --> 22:32.173
'Cause I don't like mine all drippy.

22:33.227 --> 22:35.559
Yeah, sure. Sorry.

22:35.604 --> 22:38.346
Wait. l'll walk with you.

22:38.399 --> 22:42.938
So, Gail said you haven't decided
where you're going after 15 Division.

22:42.987 --> 22:45.729
Yeah, well, you know,
I'm just really happy here,

22:45.781 --> 22:47.988
you know, doing what I'm doing,
for now...

22:48.033 --> 22:50.319
but I, uh,
definitely have thoughts.

22:50.369 --> 22:53.452
What about Gail?
Has she said what she's planning?

22:53.497 --> 22:55.488
Uh, it's something
you probably want to ask her.

22:55.541 --> 22:57.623
But I'm asking you.

22:57.668 --> 23:00.125
Yeah, um, I just don't know

23:00.170 --> 23:03.833
if she'd be cool with me telling
you about her. No offense.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.498
Who said you needed to tell her?

23:05.551 --> 23:08.258
Superintendent, that was
the chief's executive assistant.

23:08.304 --> 23:10.044
Apparently, we're getting
getting new communications tech.

23:11.348 --> 23:14.306
We'll talk later. You know,

23:14.351 --> 23:17.809
Chris, you really should think more
about what you want.

23:17.855 --> 23:21.643
And don't listen to Gail.
I can be very helpful,

23:21.692 --> 23:24.058
maternal, even.

23:24.111 --> 23:25.772
Sweet.

23:29.116 --> 23:30.697
All right, she's gonna take a bath.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.574
I'm gonna go head out
and get those magazines.

23:36.457 --> 23:38.743
Did we really call her sister?

23:38.792 --> 23:40.373
You know,
sometimes you say a thing

23:40.419 --> 23:43.252
just to get the job done,
you know, like,

23:43.297 --> 23:45.583
"It'll happen for you.
Things are gonna get better."

23:45.633 --> 23:47.214
I actually believe that.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.715
Fine.

23:48.761 --> 23:50.922
Department'll get the magazines.

23:50.971 --> 23:52.347
Just, um——

23:52.389 --> 23:53.765
Just let me...

24:07.237 --> 24:09.728
— Is it nice?
— Yeah.

24:09.782 --> 24:12.273
Yeah. When were you there?

24:12.326 --> 24:14.066
Uh, Friday.
We were on a stakeout.

24:15.245 --> 24:16.496
With who?

24:16.538 --> 24:19.245
Just me, spin team.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.782
Luke?

24:21.835 --> 24:22.824
W—What?

24:26.131 --> 24:28.247
Were you with Luke?

24:28.300 --> 24:29.585
No.

24:34.556 --> 24:35.966
His credit card was there.

24:36.016 --> 24:38.098
Well, he might have stopped by.

24:38.143 --> 24:40.725
On his way to the cabin?

24:40.771 --> 24:41.931
Sure.

24:43.273 --> 24:44.649
So he did go to the cabin.

24:47.277 --> 24:48.983
If that's what he told you.

24:52.741 --> 24:54.697
Did something happen
with you guys?

24:56.495 --> 24:57.905
Jo, did something happen?!

24:57.955 --> 25:00.412
Uh, just go.
Get your magazines.

25:00.457 --> 25:03.449
Just go. Okay? Just go.

25:08.298 --> 25:10.289
(airplane passing overhead)

25:16.265 --> 25:17.630
(sighs)

25:21.520 --> 25:23.886
(exhales deeply)

25:23.939 --> 25:26.601
(woman)
J‘ Don't the hours grow shorter J‘

25:26.650 --> 25:30.142
J‘ As the days go by? J‘

25:30.195 --> 25:32.356
(line ringing)

25:34.366 --> 25:36.448
(voice mail) You've reached
Detective Luke Callaghan. Please lea——

25:36.493 --> 25:38.279
J‘ You know you have to stop J‘

25:38.328 --> 25:43.322
J‘ And open your eyes J‘

25:47.713 --> 25:54.084
J‘ One day, you're waiting
for the sky to fall J‘

25:55.888 --> 25:58.595
Kid's asleep in Jerry's chair.
According to Gregor,

25:58.640 --> 26:00.926
he was in a Russian orphanage
up until last year.

26:00.976 --> 26:03.683
But the marks on his wrist are
fresh, must've happened here.

26:03.729 --> 26:05.890
Anyway, I'm sure Children's Aid
will look into it.

26:05.939 --> 26:07.600
You did call Children's Aid, right?

26:09.109 --> 26:11.896
Gail, your mo——Superintendent——

26:11.945 --> 26:14.197
You always do
what your mama tells you?

26:14.239 --> 26:15.228
Okay.

26:16.450 --> 26:18.987
Apparently,
his last name is Adinocki.

26:19.036 --> 26:20.822
— Adinochka.
— What he said.

26:20.871 --> 26:21.860
How do | spell that?

26:22.915 --> 26:24.906
(airplane passing overhead)

26:33.133 --> 26:35.419
(siren wailing in distance)

26:35.469 --> 26:37.050
— (Jo groans)
— What happened?

26:37.096 --> 26:39.337
— That little bitch hit me!
— Where is she?

26:39.389 --> 26:41.129
— I don't know.
— Where did she go?

26:41.183 --> 26:43.014
I don't know!

26:54.363 --> 26:55.728
(door closes)

26:55.781 --> 26:57.737
Checked the perimeter.
I can't find Deena.

26:57.783 --> 26:59.489
The door was locked.
l busted in.

26:59.535 --> 27:00.615
l was worried
she was hurting herself.

27:00.661 --> 27:02.572
Yeah, towel rack.

27:02.621 --> 27:05.704
Yeah, resourceful girl.

27:05.749 --> 27:08.616
(Andy sighs)

27:08.669 --> 27:10.876
— McNally——
— We need to find Deena.

27:10.921 --> 27:12.957
Why? She's not gonna testify now.

27:13.006 --> 27:13.836
Well, Darrell doesn't know that.

27:13.882 --> 27:15.418
He just knows
that she didn't come home,

27:15.467 --> 27:17.298
which means that she snitched,

27:17.344 --> 27:19.460
which means he's gonna kill her.

27:23.934 --> 27:24.889
(siren whoops)

27:24.935 --> 27:26.596
Has the girl called anyone yet?

27:26.645 --> 27:28.931
Uh, we cloned her phone
when she was in interview with Rosati,

27:28.981 --> 27:30.596
so I'm calling the Spin Team
right now.

27:30.649 --> 27:32.105
We got all available foot patrol

27:32.151 --> 27:34.437
checking all known Jameson
hangouts——clubs, corners.

27:34.486 --> 27:36.772
Two witnesses in one day,
same case.

27:36.822 --> 27:38.278
I want to be updated
every three minutes.

27:38.323 --> 27:39.483
Yeah.

27:39.533 --> 27:41.649
And I don't want anything out there
about her witness testimony.

27:41.702 --> 27:43.033
Might as well paint a target
on her back.

27:43.078 --> 27:44.409
Sam, I got Frank here. Frank.

27:44.454 --> 27:45.864
Sam?

27:45.914 --> 27:49.281
Informant told us the Jamesons
have some properties downtown,

27:49.334 --> 27:50.665
possible safe houses.

27:50.711 --> 27:53.919
Checked 'em out.
No sign of Darrell.

27:53.964 --> 27:55.579
We can stick around
the neighborhood,

27:55.632 --> 27:56.621
uh, see if he shows up.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.836
Okay, but keep me posted. A lot.

27:58.886 --> 28:00.001
Frank.

28:03.682 --> 28:04.671
(cell phone beeps off)

28:05.976 --> 28:08.183
l have a, um...

28:08.228 --> 28:10.890
(clears throat)

28:10.939 --> 28:13.191
Superintendent.

28:13.233 --> 28:15.474
There's nothing
under "Toma Adinocki,"

28:15.527 --> 28:18.485
because that's not his real name.
It wasn't until we——

28:18.530 --> 28:20.987
Officer Peck searched
the missing persons photos

28:21.033 --> 28:22.193
that we found him.

28:22.242 --> 28:23.357
Yeah, his real name's Toma Morev.

28:24.995 --> 28:26.701
So where did "Adinocki" come from?

28:26.747 --> 28:29.238
It means "alone."
I mean, he either made it up,

28:29.291 --> 28:31.247
or he got mixed up.
I... don't know.

28:31.293 --> 28:32.783
Okay, you know what?
That's fine.

28:32.836 --> 28:33.996
Did he see something or not?

28:34.046 --> 28:35.536
Uh, no, he didn't.
He was hiding.

28:35.589 --> 28:36.874
Okay.

28:36.924 --> 28:37.913
But we have his parents——

28:37.966 --> 28:39.672
his adoptive parents coming in.

28:39.718 --> 28:42.175
Why? If it's an adoption issue,
that's Immigration.

28:42.221 --> 28:43.836
If it's abuse,
that's Special Victims.

28:43.889 --> 28:46.426
Yeah, well, I'd kinda like to know
why they've been tying him up.

28:46.475 --> 28:48.932
Children's Aid will find that out,
so let's let this go, guys,

28:48.977 --> 28:51.468
'cause I kinda need you out there
looking for this girl.

28:51.521 --> 28:53.022
I'm just trying
to make a collar here.

28:53.065 --> 28:54.805
If this is child abuse
and we can prove it,

28:54.858 --> 28:58.646
that looks pretty good
on 15 and you,

28:58.695 --> 28:59.901
especially tonight.

29:01.573 --> 29:04.736
Fine. Just remember this
when I'm working for you.

29:04.785 --> 29:07.572
Absolutely, Detective.
You were always my favorite.

29:07.621 --> 29:09.862
— (scoffs)
— Jerry.

29:09.915 --> 29:12.782
If this has anything to do with
the Russian kid, I don't care.

29:12.834 --> 29:14.995
No, uh, we found her.
The girl you're looking for, Deena,

29:15.045 --> 29:17.502
— we got her. Really.
— Okay.

29:17.547 --> 29:20.960
The, uh, Spin Team recorded this
from Deena's phone——

29:21.009 --> 29:22.749
her cell——uh, four minutes ago.

29:22.803 --> 29:25.169
At least she's not
a criminal mastermind.

29:25.222 --> 29:27.508
— (Deena) Hey, it's me.
— (man) Where you at, D?

29:27.557 --> 29:30.014
No, I'm fine. I didn't tell them
anything, though. I swear.

29:30.060 --> 29:32.893
— I just——| really want to see you.
— So let me come get you.

29:32.938 --> 29:36.101
They showed me these pictures
of, um, these other girls,

29:36.149 --> 29:37.559
and they were hurt really bad.

29:37.609 --> 29:39.520
Deena, Deena, Deena.
Have I ever hurt you?

29:39.569 --> 29:41.434
No. I just want us to be together,

29:41.488 --> 29:43.103
and I want us
to have a home together.

29:43.156 --> 29:44.987
I know, sweetheart. I know.

29:45.033 --> 29:47.740
Let's just talk about it, all right?
At our new place.

29:47.786 --> 29:50.744
You remember the park
where our kid's gonna play,

29:50.789 --> 29:52.745
you know,
where we made those wishes?

29:52.791 --> 29:54.406
— Yeah. Okay.
—(beep)

29:54.459 --> 29:58.372
What the hell park
are they talking about?

29:58.422 --> 30:01.755
Any units have information
on possible whereabouts

30:01.800 --> 30:05.759
of missing party,
please advise S—1 on channel 2.

30:05.804 --> 30:08.011
The last condo we saw,
one of the Jameson properties,

30:08.056 --> 30:09.011
it had a park.

30:09.057 --> 30:10.672
Yeah, they all had parks, Nash.

30:10.726 --> 30:12.682
But this one had a fountain.

30:12.728 --> 30:14.343
Where else do you make wishes?

30:15.564 --> 30:17.145
Fine. Let's give it a whirl.

30:17.190 --> 30:18.566
But keep it off the radio for now.

30:18.608 --> 30:21.065
No leaks until we get her back.

30:21.111 --> 30:22.692
(cell phone beeps)

30:24.823 --> 30:27.030
Just so you know, the story
I'm telling the Sarge——

30:27.075 --> 30:28.326
you had nothing to do
with the witness escaping.

30:28.368 --> 30:29.608
It's all on me.

30:29.661 --> 30:30.867
That's not a story. That's true.

30:32.664 --> 30:34.450
Then I guess
we should probably talk.

30:34.499 --> 30:37.536
You know, we have a job to do,
Detective. Let's just do that.

30:42.299 --> 30:43.630
(We Were Promised Jetpacks)
J‘ Oh, no... J‘

30:43.675 --> 30:45.711
Backup units are on their way.

30:45.761 --> 30:47.626
Keep all radio chatter
on a secure channel

30:47.679 --> 30:48.759
and wait for my go.

30:48.805 --> 30:51.421
If the girl shows,
we pick her up,

30:51.475 --> 30:53.386
wait for Darrell to arrive,
if he arrives.

30:53.435 --> 30:54.845
If Darrell shows first?

30:54.895 --> 30:56.510
Take him down
as fast as possible.

30:56.563 --> 30:57.552
Do what you gotta do.

31:04.321 --> 31:05.436
(cell phone rings)

31:05.489 --> 31:07.571
J‘ Something's happened J‘

31:07.616 --> 31:08.696
(Hng)

31:08.742 --> 31:12.075
J‘ In the attic J‘

31:12.120 --> 31:16.159
J‘ There's no way
I am going up there J‘

31:17.959 --> 31:20.746
J‘ Something's happened J‘

31:20.796 --> 31:24.539
J‘ In the attic J‘

31:24.591 --> 31:29.130
J‘ We both know
I'm not going up there... J‘

31:29.179 --> 31:31.761
(man) This is Echo 1.
Status reports?

31:31.807 --> 31:33.923
(Oliver) 1509. We're en route
to the east perimeter.

31:33.975 --> 31:36.182
North perimeter is cold.

31:36.228 --> 31:40.187
(man) 1530. No cars or pedestrians
in the southwest lot.

31:40.232 --> 31:42.894
(Echo 1 officer)
Foot patrol, do we have a visual?

31:42.943 --> 31:46.401
(man) Foxtrot's a negative on the girl.
No eyes on Jameson either.

31:49.241 --> 31:52.233
(Oliver) Stand by.
Possible visual on the girl.

31:54.079 --> 31:55.569
Female entering
from the southeast corner.

31:55.622 --> 31:57.613
J‘ Something's happened... J‘

31:57.666 --> 31:59.281
We marked her.
McNally and I will approach.

31:59.334 --> 32:02.542
J‘ In the attic J‘

32:02.587 --> 32:06.956
J‘ There's no way
I am going up there J‘

32:08.093 --> 32:11.426
J‘ Something's happened J‘

32:11.471 --> 32:13.382
J‘ In the attic... J‘

32:13.432 --> 32:14.512
(man) We got him. He's alone.

32:14.558 --> 32:15.673
Red and black jacket,

32:15.725 --> 32:17.135
coming in from the east perimeter.

32:17.185 --> 32:20.177
J‘ ...going up there J‘

32:20.230 --> 32:23.893
J‘ Something's happened J‘

32:23.942 --> 32:30.359
J‘ In the attic J‘

32:33.743 --> 32:36.826
Police! Don't move!
Do not move!

32:36.872 --> 32:38.487
Let's go!
Get down on your knees!

32:38.540 --> 32:39.575
(Deena) No! Don't do it!

32:39.624 --> 32:40.739
Put that gun down very slowly.

32:40.792 --> 32:41.781
That's right.

32:41.835 --> 32:43.666
Put your hands on your head.

32:43.712 --> 32:45.373
On your head. That's right.

32:45.422 --> 32:47.128
— Look at me.
— (sobbing)

32:47.174 --> 32:48.289
Nash, cuff him.

32:48.341 --> 32:50.957
(Deena sobbing)

32:54.806 --> 32:57.764
(siren wails)

32:57.809 --> 33:00.346
And you have no idea
how he got downtown?

33:01.855 --> 33:03.345
Do you know how many times

33:03.398 --> 33:05.309
he's run away
since we brought him over?

33:05.358 --> 33:07.223
His therapist said it's
gonna be a long transition.

33:07.277 --> 33:08.983
Toma has a therapist?

33:09.029 --> 33:11.771
Oh, sure. He's got one.
My wife has one.

33:11.823 --> 33:14.485
I have one.
You want one, too?

33:14.534 --> 33:16.445
Look, we're asking,
because if he has a therapist,

33:16.495 --> 33:19.282
we would expect to see
any reports of physical abuse.

33:19.331 --> 33:20.741
It's——

33:20.790 --> 33:22.291
What about the marks on his wrists?

33:25.086 --> 33:27.042
His therapist calls it "the big hug."

33:27.088 --> 33:29.044
Uh, apparently Toma
has something called

33:29.090 --> 33:30.626
reactive attachment disorder.

33:30.675 --> 33:32.085
The whole time
he was in the orphanage,

33:32.135 --> 33:34.217
they barely touched him.
Nobody ever spoke to him.

33:34.262 --> 33:35.877
He had to survive that.
It's not his fault.

33:35.931 --> 33:37.967
He screams when you touch him,

33:38.016 --> 33:40.007
screams if you even——if you
even pat him on the shoulder.

33:40.060 --> 33:41.140
He punches. He kicks.

33:41.186 --> 33:44.394
Well, none of this is explaining
the marks on his wrists.

33:46.316 --> 33:49.023
We tried, uh, holding him to us
with our arms,

33:49.069 --> 33:50.229
but he fought it so hard.

33:50.278 --> 33:52.860
He punched.
He——He was hurting us.

33:52.906 --> 33:54.396
(sighs)

33:54.449 --> 33:56.064
We tied his hands.

33:58.703 --> 34:01.536
His therapist said that it was
to show him that we love him,

34:01.581 --> 34:03.697
and maybe then he could learn
to love us back.

34:13.802 --> 34:17.761
So, uh, Children's Aid
talked to your social worker.

34:17.806 --> 34:21.890
This is really stupid, 'cause
it's not like you understand me.

34:21.935 --> 34:23.891
Toma...

34:23.937 --> 34:26.929
|——| know this might be
really hard to understand,

34:26.982 --> 34:30.566
but I think those people
actually love you...

34:33.530 --> 34:35.566
and I think
you might have a chance.

34:37.492 --> 34:38.732
You guys ready?

34:43.957 --> 34:46.323
Wait. Don't forget this.

34:46.376 --> 34:47.741
I don't want you getting lost.

34:47.794 --> 34:50.581
Spasiba. (speaking Russian)

35:00.098 --> 35:01.963
Uaughs)

35:24.080 --> 35:26.241
You don't have to talk.

35:26.291 --> 35:28.532
I mean,
it's no difference to me.

35:28.585 --> 35:31.543
I mean, we've got the, uh...
(crunches)

35:31.588 --> 35:35.297
(mouth full) the statement,
and we've got the gun.

35:35.342 --> 35:37.378
So we're good to go, right?

35:37.427 --> 35:40.464
Yeah, um, at this point,
all we're talking about is,

35:40.513 --> 35:42.925
you know, how much time you're
willing to do for your crew——

35:42.974 --> 35:44.930
life, half—life,

35:44.976 --> 35:47.763
maybe less if you're willing
to help us out. (chuckles)

35:54.778 --> 35:56.814
— Yeah.
— Mm—hmm. (inhales deeply)

36:04.120 --> 36:05.405
— McNally——
— You don't need me anymore.

36:05.455 --> 36:06.945
You found her. She's safe.

36:06.998 --> 36:08.238
Deena's refusing to testify.

36:08.291 --> 36:10.373
She wants to take the rap
for Marco Forlan's murder.

36:16.841 --> 36:18.172
Deena, look at me.

36:19.219 --> 36:20.504
Look at me.

36:23.139 --> 36:25.255
He had a gun.
He was going to kill you.

36:25.308 --> 36:27.720
He was defending himself.
He was defending me.

36:27.769 --> 36:29.259
What about the other girls?

36:29.312 --> 36:31.348
The other dead girls?

36:31.398 --> 36:34.561
It——|t doesn't matter.
They don't matter.

36:34.609 --> 36:36.110
Okay, then what matters?

36:36.152 --> 36:39.144
What matters is us——
me and Darrell.

36:39.197 --> 36:40.437
(sighs)

36:43.326 --> 36:46.614
The gun in the apartment was mine.

36:49.332 --> 36:51.914
I'm 17, so I'm a minor,

36:51.960 --> 36:54.702
and... when I get out,

36:54.754 --> 36:56.494
we're gonna get a place together.

36:57.799 --> 36:59.039
Hmm.

37:03.179 --> 37:07.343
If I talk, I'm gonna spend the rest of my life
looking over my shoulder.

37:07.392 --> 37:09.348
And if I don't talk,

37:09.394 --> 37:14.013
then I'll get out in, like, one year,
maybe two,

37:14.065 --> 37:15.475
and at least I'll be alive.

37:15.525 --> 37:16.685
Alive?

37:19.487 --> 37:21.819
How can you possibly believe that?

37:21.865 --> 37:22.695
How?

37:22.741 --> 37:25.357
After everything you've seen tonight?

37:26.286 --> 37:27.776
(sighs)

37:34.377 --> 37:37.710
What I saw was my man,

37:37.756 --> 37:40.964
and he was coming to get me,
to take me home.

37:44.012 --> 37:46.879
I have nothing else to say.
I'd like to talk to a lawyer.

38:02.405 --> 38:03.781
Andy.

38:03.823 --> 38:04.938
What?

38:17.462 --> 38:18.622
(chatter, child laughing)

38:18.671 --> 38:20.878
(The Daylights) J‘ I tried J‘

38:20.924 --> 38:22.334
All right, smile.

38:22.383 --> 38:24.920
J‘ Tried to make it on my own J‘

38:24.969 --> 38:28.132
J‘ Did my best to get along J‘

38:28.181 --> 38:30.046
J‘ I tried J‘

38:31.267 --> 38:34.304
J‘ It's no use J‘

38:34.354 --> 38:37.846
J‘ Every winning streak just ends J‘

38:37.899 --> 38:41.016
J‘ Only days become the trend J‘

38:41.069 --> 38:44.687
J‘ Without you J‘

38:44.739 --> 38:48.277
J‘ 'Cause only you can make me J‘

38:48.326 --> 38:53.741
J‘ Only you can make me happy J‘

38:53.790 --> 38:57.328
J‘ Me happy J‘

38:57.377 --> 38:59.288
J‘Yeah... J‘

39:00.296 --> 39:02.127
(Gail) Do you have a family cottage?

39:02.173 --> 39:05.006
(Chris) No, we just——we just
camped in the backyard.

39:05.051 --> 39:06.712
We have a place up north.

39:06.761 --> 39:09.924
It's been in the family,
for, like, a hundred years.

39:09.973 --> 39:11.133
There was this one summer.

39:11.182 --> 39:14.390
I think I was 12 years old.

39:14.435 --> 39:16.847
My parents and I,
we drive into town.

39:16.896 --> 39:19.353
I go into a store
to get something.

39:19.399 --> 39:23.142
I come out.
Mom and Dad are gone.

39:23.194 --> 39:25.901
You find your way home through
the woods on your own.

39:25.947 --> 39:27.778
It's a Peck family tradition.

39:27.824 --> 39:30.031
Why?

39:30.618 --> 39:32.483
I guess they thought
it was for our own good.

39:32.537 --> 39:34.027
J‘ To be so... J‘

39:34.080 --> 39:36.321
That... sounds horrible.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.786
Gail, your mom's
looking for you inside,

39:38.835 --> 39:40.575
something about an interview.

39:40.628 --> 39:42.960
J‘ ...can make me happy J‘

39:43.006 --> 39:44.792
I don't want to go.

39:44.841 --> 39:46.581
J‘ Me happy... J‘

39:46.634 --> 39:47.965
It's okay. I got this.

39:48.011 --> 39:53.051
J‘ Oh, only you can make me,
only you... J‘

39:53.099 --> 39:55.215
More and more women
are rising through the ranks.

39:55.268 --> 39:56.804
Can you excuse us for a second?

39:59.314 --> 40:02.056
Sorry.
Gail's not up to it right now.

40:02.108 --> 40:05.441
She'd like to. She really would,
but she's tired.

40:05.486 --> 40:07.522
You're a good boyfriend, Craig.

40:09.032 --> 40:10.693
Actually, it's Chris.

40:11.117 --> 40:14.075
I'm sure Gail will appreciate
your loyalty...

40:15.872 --> 40:17.203
even if I don't.

40:17.248 --> 40:20.536
J‘ Wouldn't wanna live
another day J‘

40:20.585 --> 40:23.247
J‘ Without, without J‘

40:23.296 --> 40:25.753
J‘ Without J‘

40:25.798 --> 40:31.384
J‘ 'Cause only you can make me J‘

40:31.429 --> 40:35.388
—Andy?
— J‘ Ohh... J‘

40:38.686 --> 40:44.226
J‘ Only you can make me J‘

40:44.275 --> 40:48.439
J‘ Ohh, ooh... J‘

40:49.906 --> 40:51.112
Please don't do this.

40:54.077 --> 40:55.738
Andy...

40:56.871 --> 40:58.657
I screwed up.

40:58.706 --> 41:01.914
I made a huge mistake,
and I am so sorry.

41:01.960 --> 41:05.669
I know. I know,
'cause |——| got all your flowers

41:05.713 --> 41:09.251
and your dinners
and your spa packages.

41:09.300 --> 41:11.632
I can only imagine
what else I was about to get.

41:15.765 --> 41:18.131
Why did you still want
to get married?

41:21.896 --> 41:23.727
Because I love you.

41:24.774 --> 41:26.389
(scoffs)

41:32.115 --> 41:34.652
The ring is in the Iockbox,

41:34.701 --> 41:36.362
where I found it.

41:36.411 --> 41:37.992
J‘ ...make me J‘

41:38.037 --> 41:41.825
J‘ Only you can make me J‘

41:41.874 --> 41:42.829
(door slams)

41:42.875 --> 41:45.287
J‘ Happy J‘
