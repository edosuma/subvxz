Daddy, who
was Muhammad Ali?

00:47.880 --> 00:49.615
Oh, he was the greatest.

00:52.585 --> 00:53.483
The greatest?

00:53.485 --> 00:54.451
Yes sir.

00:54.453 --> 00:55.621
He was daddy's first hero.

00:59.758 --> 01:01.294
I thought
he was a boxer.

01:02.795 --> 01:04.798
Well he was,
he was a boxer, but,

01:05.763 --> 01:06.597
he was so much more.

01:09.200 --> 01:11.567
See, he stood by
everything he believed

01:11.569 --> 01:13.806
when it cost him
everything he worked for.

01:18.777 --> 01:21.178
Well let's
say it, Daddy, say it!

01:21.180 --> 01:22.546
all right, you ready?

01:22.548 --> 01:23.779
Float like a butterfly,

01:23.781 --> 01:25.348
Sting like a bee.

01:25.350 --> 01:27.087
Rumble,
young man, rumble!

01:28.787 --> 01:29.785
I got something for you.

01:29.787 --> 01:31.288
Ooh.

01:31.290 --> 01:32.592
Somewhere in here.

01:33.792 --> 01:34.624
Here it is.

01:34.626 --> 01:35.491
Okay.

01:35.493 --> 01:36.793
Just for me?

01:36.795 --> 01:37.895
Mhmm.

01:37.897 --> 01:38.798
Uh oh.

01:40.599 --> 01:41.832
Hey.

01:41.834 --> 01:43.433
You drew this?

01:43.435 --> 01:44.501
Mhmm.

01:44.503 --> 01:46.235
Not bad, kid.

01:46.237 --> 01:46.904
Who's that?

01:46.906 --> 01:47.803
That's me.

01:47.805 --> 01:49.505
Okay, is that mommy?

01:49.507 --> 01:50.374
Mhmm.

01:50.376 --> 01:51.207
And who's this?

01:51.209 --> 01:51.841
You.

01:51.843 --> 01:53.644
All right, good stuff.

01:53.646 --> 01:54.478
Oh hey, daddy.

01:54.480 --> 01:55.779
Hmm?

01:55.781 --> 01:56.779
Are black people
better than white people?

01:56.781 --> 01:58.347
Yes.

01:58.349 --> 02:01.785
Um, yes and no.

02:01.787 --> 02:06.323
See there are good white
people and good black people.

02:06.325 --> 02:09.226
There are bad white people
and bad black people.

02:09.228 --> 02:10.463
It's the same for both.

02:11.362 --> 02:12.362
Do you get it?

02:12.364 --> 02:13.429
Mhmm.

02:13.431 --> 02:14.231
How do you know?

02:14.233 --> 02:15.198
How do I know?

02:15.200 --> 02:17.900
Uh well, you don't really.

02:17.902 --> 02:21.637
You don't know
until it's too late.

02:21.639 --> 02:22.839
Oh, here comes mommy.

02:22.841 --> 02:27.814
Listen, let's not worry her
about what happened today, okay?

02:28.379 --> 02:29.245
Okay.

02:29.247 --> 02:30.246
It can be our secret.

02:30.248 --> 02:31.614
Hey mommy.

02:31.616 --> 02:32.451
Hey!

02:34.652 --> 02:35.521
Mr. Coleman?

02:36.955 --> 02:37.823
Mr. Coleman?

02:41.326 --> 02:45.465
Would you summarize U.S.
versus Johnson please?

02:54.806 --> 02:55.908
I'm sorry Miss Maxwell.

02:58.377 --> 02:59.342
I had to watch my son last night

02:59.344 --> 03:00.977
so I didn't make it that far.

03:00.979 --> 03:02.645
That's funny.

03:02.647 --> 03:04.850
Because that was the first
case on the assignment.

03:08.721 --> 03:10.453
You know what, since you
seem to have forgotten

03:10.455 --> 03:11.887
that this is law school
and not grade school

03:11.889 --> 03:14.824
where your parents
check their homework,

03:14.826 --> 03:15.728
come on up.

03:18.497 --> 03:19.432
Come on up.

03:21.366 --> 03:22.201
Come on.

03:30.475 --> 03:33.810
I want you to read
the case out loud

03:33.812 --> 03:35.715
to all of your classmates.

03:37.650 --> 03:39.485
Just like you did
in grammar school.

03:47.793 --> 03:48.661
Um,

04:06.478 --> 04:07.814
Charles?

04:09.782 --> 04:10.614
Charles?

04:10.616 --> 04:11.718
Charles, it's ten till!

04:13.384 --> 04:14.253
Yeah.

04:18.790 --> 04:19.725
Are you okay?

04:21.793 --> 04:23.526
Quiet this morning.

04:23.528 --> 04:26.062
Oh, I,

04:26.064 --> 04:28.935
just got a lot on my mind.

04:31.836 --> 04:33.939
It doesn't matter how
many blessings I count.

04:36.375 --> 04:37.843
You're at the top of every list.

04:39.043 --> 04:40.810
I know.

04:40.812 --> 04:43.380
'Cause I'd hurt you if I want!

04:48.786 --> 04:50.753
Is that CJ? Does
he still have a key?

04:50.755 --> 04:52.057
Hey, he's still our son.

04:54.726 --> 04:55.825
Hi baby.

04:55.827 --> 04:56.828
Hey y'all.

04:57.995 --> 04:59.396
Hey y'all?

04:59.398 --> 05:00.667
That's all we get, huh?

05:01.867 --> 05:04.000
Hey mom, hey pops.

05:04.002 --> 05:05.605
Love you, morning.

05:06.838 --> 05:08.538
Thank you so much for
letting me raid your fridge

05:08.540 --> 05:10.539
even though I don't
live with y'all no more.

05:10.541 --> 05:11.808
Hey dad.

05:11.810 --> 05:12.642
Hey.

05:12.644 --> 05:14.543
I'm running
late, I gotta go.

05:14.545 --> 05:15.781
All right, see you mom.

05:17.815 --> 05:18.650
Cool beans.

05:19.651 --> 05:20.819
That's not cool, mom.

05:24.790 --> 05:25.658
See you later.

05:29.762 --> 05:30.596
Love you.

05:31.930 --> 05:32.831
Be careful.

05:35.834 --> 05:37.336
Bye guys.

05:40.406 --> 05:41.673
Big day today, huh?

05:42.540 --> 05:43.539
Yeah man.

05:43.541 --> 05:44.409
About time too.

05:45.076 --> 05:45.944
Yeah.

05:48.613 --> 05:49.414
I'm proud of you.

05:50.949 --> 05:52.515
Uh oh.

05:52.517 --> 05:53.949
What?

05:53.951 --> 05:54.853
That look.

05:56.687 --> 05:58.687
What look, what are
you talking about?

05:58.689 --> 05:59.856
Why you tripping?

05:59.858 --> 06:00.824
Dad, you know what
look you give me.

06:00.826 --> 06:02.825
I'm not giving you a look.

06:02.827 --> 06:05.829
So you're telling me
that there's nothing

06:05.831 --> 06:06.930
on your mind right now?

06:06.932 --> 06:07.930
There's nothing on my mind.

06:07.932 --> 06:09.598
What's on your mind?

06:09.600 --> 06:11.137
Why you picking on
me this morning?

06:12.538 --> 06:13.372
I don't got any,

06:14.639 --> 06:16.772
- I mean, okay.
- You got a hot seat.

06:16.774 --> 06:18.474
Come on dad, I know you.

06:18.476 --> 06:20.043
I know you, I know the look.

06:20.045 --> 06:22.077
Oh you think you know me?

06:22.079 --> 06:24.079
I know when you make
that face, what it means.

06:24.081 --> 06:24.947
Okay.

06:24.949 --> 06:26.849
You know me.

06:26.851 --> 06:30.219
What are you, 20, 21, 22?

06:30.221 --> 06:31.687
You know I'm 23.

06:31.689 --> 06:32.856
- You're 23 okay.
- You know this.

06:32.858 --> 06:34.694
All right, you think
you're ready yet?

06:35.961 --> 06:36.860
Huh?

06:36.862 --> 06:38.861
Dad, don't do this.

06:38.863 --> 06:39.863
Come on put that knife down.

06:39.865 --> 06:41.498
Let's see what you got.

06:41.500 --> 06:43.567
- You feeling lucky today?
- I don't need luck for this.

06:43.569 --> 06:45.168
Oh, you don't need luck.

06:45.170 --> 06:47.137
Come on, lock them hands
and do the countdown.

06:47.139 --> 06:48.805
All right.

06:48.807 --> 06:50.841
Don't be upset with me
when I hurt your feelings.

06:50.843 --> 06:52.608
I was gonna say
the same thing.

06:52.610 --> 06:53.844
Right, all right.

06:53.846 --> 06:55.848
I'm gonna count it down, ready?

06:57.014 --> 06:59.050
Three, two,

07:00.819 --> 07:01.851
one!

07:04.689 --> 07:06.089
Come on, man.

07:06.091 --> 07:07.791
Get off me.

07:07.793 --> 07:08.492
I told you I ain't
no little boy no more.

07:08.494 --> 07:09.825
You're getting too old for this.

07:09.827 --> 07:10.926
I wasn't even warm yet.

07:10.928 --> 07:12.529
You're getting too old to
play these games with me.

07:12.531 --> 07:13.865
Oh, keep talking.

07:20.872 --> 07:21.873
Hey pops.

07:22.807 --> 07:23.973
What's up?

07:23.975 --> 07:25.841
Since to the
victor go the spoils,

07:25.843 --> 07:28.010
why don't you let me take
the Beamer out just one time?

07:28.012 --> 07:29.178
Say what?

07:29.180 --> 07:30.846
Come on man,
just this one time.

07:30.848 --> 07:34.851
You'd like
that, wouldn't you?

08:02.581 --> 08:03.249
Hey.

08:12.690 --> 08:16.159
So, I dropped off
Brie for her first day

08:16.161 --> 08:17.894
of her last year at
high school today.

08:17.896 --> 08:18.865
Oh wow.

08:21.867 --> 08:22.899
How's she doing?

08:22.901 --> 08:23.870
She's better.

08:24.769 --> 08:26.570
Her counselor told
us that the stealing

08:26.572 --> 08:28.872
stems from emotional issues.

08:28.874 --> 08:30.106
She was frustrated.

08:30.108 --> 08:31.675
I was like yeah, we
fucking know that.

08:32.878 --> 08:35.111
Because of the divorce and,

08:35.113 --> 08:35.982
Baby, yeah.

08:37.249 --> 08:39.715
Kids are unpredictable.

08:39.717 --> 08:41.219
No matter how much
we do for them.

08:43.788 --> 08:44.820
What's going on, man?

08:44.822 --> 08:45.456
Um.

08:47.058 --> 08:49.224
CJ's first day at the academy.

08:49.226 --> 08:51.627
He's a good kid,
he's gonna do fine.

08:51.629 --> 08:53.198
Yeah, yeah.

08:54.365 --> 08:55.965
He is.

08:55.967 --> 08:59.868
Um, I know this
goes without saying.

08:59.870 --> 09:00.872
Then why are you saying it?

09:04.643 --> 09:05.709
I'll look after him.

Yep, I know.

09:56.695 --> 09:57.330
Let's go.

09:59.096 --> 10:02.999
Fuck.

10:05.003 --> 10:07.871
You're a good father, Von.

10:07.873 --> 10:08.874
Thank you.

10:09.875 --> 10:10.942
How's your dad?

10:13.879 --> 10:15.111
Same.

10:15.113 --> 10:16.680
Yeah?

10:16.682 --> 10:17.914
You see him?

10:17.916 --> 10:18.884
Yeah.

10:19.884 --> 10:20.852
Always.

10:41.405 --> 10:42.407
Thank you counsel.

10:43.908 --> 10:46.912
Sir, do you have
anything to add?

10:48.913 --> 10:49.881
Your honor,

10:51.283 --> 10:53.918
some people say they're sorry
when they get caught up.

10:55.721 --> 10:58.921
Some don't even say sorry
when they do get caught up.

10:58.923 --> 11:00.893
So saying sorry really
don't mean much.

11:01.927 --> 11:03.859
You know what I'm saying?

11:03.861 --> 11:04.695
But what I can say

11:06.465 --> 11:07.863
is you don't ever
have to worry about me

11:07.865 --> 11:09.367
stepping foot in
this place again.

11:10.235 --> 11:11.269
It's on my word.

11:13.739 --> 11:15.137
I just,

11:15.139 --> 11:16.408
I just need that chance.

11:19.510 --> 11:21.913
I appreciate your
candor, Mr. Jackson

11:22.913 --> 11:24.283
and I've seen your improvement.

11:25.417 --> 11:26.851
Congratulations.

11:28.419 --> 11:31.954
That being said, I can't
give you probation.

11:31.956 --> 11:32.924
I just can't.

11:33.792 --> 11:37.797
Especially your
sentence being 10 years.

11:50.908 --> 11:55.914
But that does not mean that
you are without redemption.

11:57.414 --> 12:01.850
So the court orders you to
house arrest for 12 months,

12:01.852 --> 12:04.420
followed by two years
probation defense.

12:35.220 --> 12:37.286
I remember when you were nine

12:37.288 --> 12:39.488
and you wanted to
be a garbage man

12:39.490 --> 12:41.424
to keep the streets clean.

12:41.426 --> 12:45.027
Now you are doing so much more.

12:45.029 --> 12:47.930
Remember every day that
even though you are grown,

12:47.932 --> 12:50.967
even though you can't see us,

12:50.969 --> 12:53.936
and that we aren't
there to scream at you,

12:53.938 --> 12:55.440
we love you, always.

14:27.999 --> 14:29.033
You're
overdoing it, Carter.

14:30.034 --> 14:31.370
I got a date with a Cuban

14:32.570 --> 14:34.704
and you gotta go

Hey, is there a

14:55.559 --> 14:56.928
Well this is what
happens. Registration.

14:59.264 --> 15:00.662
So what was going on, sir?

15:00.664 --> 15:01.363
I mean I wasn't speeding,
my seat belt was on.

15:01.365 --> 15:04.233

No sir.

22:22.073 --> 22:23.508
I can't quit.

22:24.842 --> 22:25.811
Can't.

22:32.682 --> 22:33.919
Eve, I've worked too hard.

22:35.819 --> 22:38.623
I'm the only black judge
this town has ever seen.

22:39.824 --> 22:40.826
If I quit, they win.

22:58.075 --> 23:00.545
Do you think I don't care?

23:02.814 --> 23:03.915
Do you think I don't care?

23:14.858 --> 23:16.025
I get sick to my stomach.

23:16.027 --> 23:17.929
Like literally sick.

23:19.063 --> 23:20.930
Every time I turn on the TV

23:20.932 --> 23:23.999
and see another
black boy killed.

23:25.536 --> 23:26.605
It makes me,

23:34.211 --> 23:35.547
but then I remember.

23:40.218 --> 23:42.086
I came from the
streets, and I can't,

23:45.756 --> 23:46.892
I'm a judge now.

23:48.759 --> 23:49.861
I have to be different.

23:53.897 --> 23:55.500
I have to do my job better.

23:58.836 --> 24:00.137
I have to make them see me.

24:04.141 --> 24:07.211
I can't quit, I have
to be different.

24:09.646 --> 24:11.015
CJ was different.

25:09.240 --> 25:10.672
Yo, Javier, Javier!

25:10.674 --> 25:11.643
They shot Diego!

25:12.309 --> 25:13.575
What the fuck, man?

25:13.577 --> 25:14.843
What happened?

25:14.845 --> 25:16.077
He crossed over
to Parramore, man.

25:16.079 --> 25:17.580
To see some broad.

25:17.582 --> 25:18.884
I told this dude, man.

25:20.351 --> 25:21.816
Diego, you know
better than that.

25:21.818 --> 25:23.852
The truce stops at Parramore.

25:23.854 --> 25:25.853
Javier, it hurts
man, it hurts.

25:25.855 --> 25:27.288
Come on man, he's leaking.

25:27.290 --> 25:28.690
Get him to a hospital.

25:28.692 --> 25:29.659
Mmm-mm, Mmm-mm!

25:29.661 --> 25:31.663
Warrants man, I can't
do it, I got warrants.

25:32.829 --> 25:34.330
Okay homie, listen.

25:34.332 --> 25:36.364
You wanna go to jail
or you wanna die?

25:36.366 --> 25:37.801
'Cause I can't fix that.

25:39.836 --> 25:41.202
Okay, all right.

25:41.204 --> 25:42.705
I'll get you a lawyer now.

25:42.707 --> 25:44.640
Cop your bail and
everything, okay?

25:44.642 --> 25:46.709
Just, J, just don't die on me.

25:46.711 --> 25:48.811
Get him to a hospital.

25:52.717 --> 25:53.652
Don't die.

25:56.053 --> 25:59.121
Hi yes, I'm Karen
White standing outside city hall

25:59.123 --> 26:02.224
where you all recall there
was a terrible tragic shooting

26:02.226 --> 26:05.326
by State Police last week.

26:05.328 --> 26:07.962
And what happens now is
that an anonymous source

26:07.964 --> 26:10.099
has indicated that
this city will meet

26:10.101 --> 26:12.867
with Judge Coleman today
regarding the death

26:12.869 --> 26:16.104
of his son Charles
Coleman Junior.

26:16.106 --> 26:18.106
The city has been
divided by the shooting.

26:18.108 --> 26:20.709
Black lives matter has
shown up, it's been...

26:22.913 --> 26:23.981
Why did you do that?

26:24.914 --> 26:26.350
CJ's not a cause.

26:27.384 --> 26:28.219
He's our son.

26:42.967 --> 26:45.167
Rory Carter, Von Clements.

26:45.169 --> 26:45.971
I remember them.

26:46.871 --> 26:48.206
They say CJ had a gun.

26:49.973 --> 26:50.939
Yeah.

26:50.941 --> 26:53.042
That's what they say.

26:53.044 --> 26:54.977
Do you believe them?

26:54.979 --> 26:55.880
I don't.

26:59.884 --> 27:01.717
You say that like
it's a question.

27:01.719 --> 27:03.054
Just telling you what I know.

27:04.221 --> 27:04.786
Why are they even
meeting if they think

27:04.788 --> 27:05.990
CJ did something wrong?

27:08.259 --> 27:09.728
Kids are unpredictable.

27:10.894 --> 27:12.696
No matter who their parents are.

27:14.230 --> 27:15.998
But they're our kids.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.902
We gotta believe them, right?

27:18.903 --> 27:21.405
I know he didn't have a gun.

27:34.919 --> 27:35.887
You okay, kid?

27:37.087 --> 27:38.889
Heard you got a meeting
with Brock today.

27:44.394 --> 27:45.230
Good.

27:46.463 --> 27:47.264
You got it.

27:50.101 --> 27:52.003
I put enough time
into my job that I

27:53.471 --> 27:54.870
thought it was easier that
I just pick up my pension

27:54.872 --> 27:56.841
instead of going through
another investigation.

27:58.375 --> 27:59.911
Hey Rory, listen, I,

28:01.746 --> 28:02.814
It's okay.

28:04.248 --> 28:05.980
You don't have to thank me.

28:05.982 --> 28:07.850
No, that wasn't
what I was gonna say.

28:07.852 --> 28:08.484
Are you gonna say
something that's gonna

28:08.486 --> 28:09.320
cost me my pension?

28:10.887 --> 28:12.220
Yeah, after I saved your ass?

28:12.222 --> 28:12.787
Come on.

28:12.789 --> 28:14.856
Yes, I saved your ass.

28:14.858 --> 28:15.993
For some punk ass kid.

28:18.229 --> 28:20.362
Is that what you're
gonna say to me?

28:20.364 --> 28:21.199
No, man.

28:22.866 --> 28:24.866
You killed the kid.

28:24.868 --> 28:25.801
You killed the kid
and you planted

28:25.803 --> 28:27.072
a fucking gun on him, Rory.

28:28.404 --> 28:29.403
Oh fuck.

28:29.405 --> 28:30.372
It's done.

28:30.374 --> 28:31.405
It's not done!

28:31.407 --> 28:32.908
It's done.

28:32.910 --> 28:34.109
And there's nothing
you could say,

28:34.111 --> 28:36.911
today, tomorrow, that'll
bring that kid back.

28:36.913 --> 28:37.848
I know.

28:39.150 --> 28:41.415
I fucking know.

28:41.417 --> 28:42.953
He should have known better.

28:44.154 --> 28:46.889
He stuck his hand
inside a bag, Von.

28:46.891 --> 28:49.892
How are you supposed to know
what he's gonna pull out?

28:49.894 --> 28:50.992
Now just think of this.

28:50.994 --> 28:53.327
If he did have a gun,

28:53.329 --> 28:56.364
if you hesitated to
shoot, then what?

28:56.366 --> 28:58.801
He didn't have a gun, Rory.

28:58.803 --> 29:00.401
The official report
says he had a gun.

29:00.403 --> 29:02.507
He just reached for
his fucking wallet.

29:04.008 --> 29:06.141
I've covered you in the street

29:06.143 --> 29:07.345
and I'm asking you now.

29:08.511 --> 29:09.346
Cover me.

29:42.278 --> 29:44.015
What's this, a showdown?

29:45.415 --> 29:49.119
200 calendars ago, the
fastest draw would walk away.

29:50.086 --> 29:53.121
Today, we both do.

29:53.123 --> 29:54.926
My son doesn't
get to walk away.

30:07.971 --> 30:08.940
Judge.

30:11.909 --> 30:12.877
I uh,

30:13.877 --> 30:17.481
You can't even bring
yourself to apologize?

30:25.556 --> 30:28.826
I don't apologize
for doing my job.

30:32.363 --> 30:36.430
You don't realize,
that kid you killed,

30:36.432 --> 30:37.932
he has a father.

30:37.934 --> 30:39.369
A father with resources.

30:40.938 --> 30:43.374
A father who's gonna use
every single resource he has

30:45.108 --> 30:46.941
to make sure you
never forget the day

30:46.943 --> 30:48.276
you pulled that trigger.

30:48.278 --> 30:51.013
That box, that's
only the beginning.

30:51.015 --> 30:55.920
Like I said, I don't
apologize for doing my job.

31:08.999 --> 31:13.701
Shh.

31:13.703 --> 31:15.237
And you feared for your life?

31:15.239 --> 31:16.941
That's when you began to fire?

31:21.045 --> 31:24.949
Is there anything else
you would like to add?

31:26.317 --> 31:29.584
Son, anything else
you'd like to add?

31:29.586 --> 31:30.451
No.

31:30.453 --> 31:31.321
No.

31:46.403 --> 31:49.171
Mayor Johnson should
be here shortly.

31:49.173 --> 31:49.973
Thank you.

31:56.446 --> 31:57.446
Good morning judge.

31:57.448 --> 31:59.046
I apologize for the tardiness.

31:59.048 --> 32:00.449
I found myself on the wrong end

32:00.451 --> 32:02.183
of a fender bender this morning.

32:02.185 --> 32:04.518
And then the guy that
hit me had the audacity

32:04.520 --> 32:06.755
to try and flee the scene.
Now you know my motto.

32:06.757 --> 32:08.289
Action don't happen
until I act on.

32:08.291 --> 32:10.459
So I chased him
down, blocked him in,

32:10.461 --> 32:13.027
called our finest
and booked his butt.

32:13.029 --> 32:14.696
Right.

32:14.698 --> 32:15.630
Good to see you too.

32:15.632 --> 32:16.731
You know everybody here.

32:16.733 --> 32:18.502
DOJ Hinkle.

32:19.737 --> 32:21.306
Chief Mallard, Deputies.

32:23.673 --> 32:25.106
Gentlemen, our Mayor,

32:25.108 --> 32:26.741
I thought we were having
this meeting in private.

32:26.743 --> 32:28.110
Yes, of course.

32:28.112 --> 32:30.746
But being as this
is a public entity,

32:30.748 --> 32:34.415
I'm bound by my open
meeting laws to be open.

32:34.417 --> 32:35.252
Very well.

32:37.020 --> 32:39.286
Sir, I know you finished
the investigation.

32:39.288 --> 32:40.756
I'd like to know
what you plan to do

32:40.758 --> 32:43.257
to the gentlemen
that murdered my son.

32:43.259 --> 32:45.529
And I'm assuming you've
landed on a punishment.

32:49.032 --> 32:49.967
Uh, judge.

32:52.068 --> 32:53.668
I'll speak plainly.

32:53.670 --> 32:57.506
As an institution, we
have to trust our officers

32:57.508 --> 33:00.142
unless we find evidence
to the contrary.

33:00.144 --> 33:02.777
You've seen the defense
lawyers attack them in court.

33:02.779 --> 33:05.546
If we lose that deference,

33:05.548 --> 33:07.748
then every slick
lawyer in the country

33:07.750 --> 33:10.187
will be walking shysters
down the street.

33:15.592 --> 33:18.459
Based on everything our
investigators found,

33:18.461 --> 33:21.263
the officers involved
in CJ's incident

33:21.265 --> 33:24.469
would not be disciplined
or charged in any way.

33:25.769 --> 33:28.772
The Fed reviewed our
findings and signed off.

33:30.540 --> 33:32.175
The Federal government agrees?

33:33.076 --> 33:34.578
Unfortunately, yes.

33:36.747 --> 33:38.747
Chief Mallard, the Department
has signed off on this?

33:38.749 --> 33:41.749
Judge, I know this
must be hard for you

33:41.751 --> 33:43.718
to understand right now.

33:43.720 --> 33:45.754
But whenever there's a
doubt of what happened

33:45.756 --> 33:48.824
on the field, we have
to rely on the testimony

33:48.826 --> 33:50.725
of our officers.

33:50.727 --> 33:53.761
As a former officer
and as a judge,

33:53.763 --> 33:55.529
you must understand this.

33:55.531 --> 33:56.797
If you're on the
wrong side of this,

33:56.799 --> 33:58.699
where are people like me?

33:58.701 --> 34:02.603
Or better yet, people who know
a lot less than me to turn

34:02.605 --> 34:05.407
when the gatekeeper
keeps the gate closed?

34:05.409 --> 34:06.210
Charles?

34:07.678 --> 34:11.215
I hold you in the highest
esteem, highest respect.

34:12.483 --> 34:15.416
I mean, you've been on
the bench for 10 years.

34:15.418 --> 34:17.184
Raised by a single mom

34:17.186 --> 34:20.521
in one of the most dangerous
cities in the country.

34:20.523 --> 34:22.556
And in spite of all
that, you did things

34:22.559 --> 34:24.391
people would deem impossible.

34:24.393 --> 34:25.661
We recognize that.

34:26.762 --> 34:28.165
So I went to bat for you.

34:29.599 --> 34:32.534
I was able to convince
our City Council

34:32.536 --> 34:35.768
to do what we felt was in
everybody's best interest

34:35.771 --> 34:38.440
to make a gesture
of good will to you.

34:38.442 --> 34:42.775
Honey, what we have
here is a tragedy.

34:42.777 --> 34:46.349
There is no course that
will make things right.

34:47.483 --> 34:49.085
But in my power, I
can offer you that.

34:52.889 --> 34:54.558
Say yes, Charles.

35:05.601 --> 35:06.767
Charles?

35:06.769 --> 35:07.605
Mayor.

35:09.438 --> 35:10.072
Charles.

35:19.949 --> 35:22.786
Well, you know
what we have to do.

35:24.855 --> 35:25.789
Okay?

35:40.771 --> 35:41.706
Stevens.

35:42.572 --> 35:43.871
It didn't go well.

35:43.873 --> 35:44.774
What?

35:45.775 --> 35:47.541
You were right.

35:47.543 --> 35:48.746
They said CJ pulled.

35:50.780 --> 35:52.479
They killed my son,
left him in a river

35:52.481 --> 35:53.884
of his own blood for no reason.

35:57.887 --> 36:01.789
And Eve, she's not the same.

36:01.791 --> 36:05.795
And she's not gonna be
until I get some answers.

36:06.797 --> 36:08.762
- Bring a civil.
- No, I can't do that.

36:08.764 --> 36:10.565
If I do that they'll
take me off cases.

36:10.567 --> 36:12.170
I can do more good on the bench.

36:13.237 --> 36:14.172
But Eve, man.

36:16.907 --> 36:19.340
I mean you were IA, you know.

36:19.342 --> 36:22.379
You have access to all
the internal files.

36:23.480 --> 36:26.184
Look, you had my
back back in the day.

36:27.451 --> 36:28.351
I won't forget it.

36:29.418 --> 36:30.784
Let me see what I can do.

36:30.786 --> 36:31.621
Okay.

36:41.632 --> 36:42.465
Stevens.

36:43.800 --> 36:45.702
Detective, you
can't go up there.

36:47.637 --> 36:48.505
Prick.

37:10.760 --> 37:12.295
That's not good.

37:24.307 --> 37:25.639
Hey.

37:25.641 --> 37:27.008
Check your email.

37:27.010 --> 37:27.845
Wasn't from me.

38:15.659 --> 38:16.590
Good evening.

38:16.592 --> 38:18.126
My name is Judge Coleman.

38:18.128 --> 38:19.827
I'm looking for Javier.

38:19.829 --> 38:21.729
Javier is not at home.

38:21.731 --> 38:22.930
He's not in trouble, is he?

38:22.932 --> 38:25.367
No, no, not at all.

38:25.369 --> 38:26.700
This actually is
an informal visit.

38:26.702 --> 38:28.371
I just wanted to,

38:29.806 --> 38:30.807
he and I have,

38:31.807 --> 38:34.742
I just wanted some
advice from him.

38:34.744 --> 38:36.813
You're a judge, and
you need his advice?

38:58.135 --> 38:58.903
Hey.

39:07.911 --> 39:11.615
No you don't need to
say nothing to anybody.

39:18.054 --> 39:20.854
Hey, Javier is at work.

39:20.856 --> 39:22.824
It's the auto shop
down the block.

39:22.826 --> 39:26.894
Take a left, two lights,
a right, Ralphie's.

39:26.896 --> 39:27.831
Thank you.

39:30.666 --> 39:31.601
Hey, um.

39:34.771 --> 39:35.840
I'm sorry for your loss.

39:36.907 --> 39:38.642
About what happened to Ralphie.

39:54.990 --> 39:55.990
Hey, fellas, is there a prob...

39:56.827 --> 39:58.492
Oh!

39:58.494 --> 39:59.894
Why you coming around and
asking questions about Ralphie?

39:59.896 --> 40:00.929
Wait, wait, hold up, hold up.

40:00.931 --> 40:01.929
Hold up, who are you?

40:04.201 --> 40:05.733
Who is this guy?

40:05.735 --> 40:07.802
Hey, what do you want?

40:07.804 --> 40:09.838
What is wrong with
you, are you crazy?

40:09.840 --> 40:11.840
You need to roll, man.
You need to get out of here.

40:11.842 --> 40:13.807
Hold up, I'm looking
for Javier Garcia.

40:13.809 --> 40:15.175
You went to my house
asking my wife first

40:15.177 --> 40:16.077
about my son?

40:16.079 --> 40:17.845
Is it you, are you Javier?

40:17.847 --> 40:19.179
Listen, I'm a judge, all right?

40:19.181 --> 40:20.548
I'm Judge Coleman.

40:20.550 --> 40:22.550
I didn't ask, I
didn't ask your name.

40:22.552 --> 40:24.488
Look, this is my son, okay?

40:26.822 --> 40:27.822
I just need a
moment of your time.

40:27.824 --> 40:30.561
I need your help, I need
to ask you a few things.

40:31.594 --> 40:32.195
Please.

40:35.931 --> 40:37.500
What happened to the photo?

40:39.168 --> 40:40.237
How did you find your
way to this side of town?

40:43.672 --> 40:46.209
My son got shot by the
same officers who shot yours.

40:49.545 --> 40:51.746
I don't really discuss that.

40:51.748 --> 40:53.851
The report says
that your son ran

40:55.150 --> 40:57.851
and he pulled a gun, and
it said you filed a report.

40:57.853 --> 40:59.854
I got your address that way.

40:59.856 --> 41:00.954
Not me, my old lady.

41:00.956 --> 41:02.923
I know better than that.

41:02.925 --> 41:04.228
Can you hand me that
hammer right there, please?

41:05.094 --> 41:06.830
It's the hammer you're next to.

41:09.032 --> 41:10.831
You know better than
that? Better than what?

41:10.833 --> 41:12.066
Okay check it.

41:12.068 --> 41:14.836
When I was coming up
we lived by a code.

41:14.838 --> 41:16.871
You take mine, I take yours.

41:16.873 --> 41:18.740
You never snitch on your homies.

41:18.742 --> 41:21.775
Police play by the same rules.

41:21.777 --> 41:25.847
You shoot a cop, you're
lucky to make it out alive.

41:25.849 --> 41:27.815
So you say you're
a judge, right?

41:27.817 --> 41:29.016
Yes sir.

41:29.018 --> 41:30.284
How many times you
see a regular kid

41:30.286 --> 41:32.287
with a complaint against a cop?

41:32.289 --> 41:34.856
How many times a cop
snitch on another cop

41:34.858 --> 41:36.093
and still around to tell?

41:37.860 --> 41:39.092
That's my point.

41:39.094 --> 41:41.229
I don't need to go to
law school for that.

41:41.231 --> 41:42.563
My bad about your window.

41:42.565 --> 41:43.630
Be ready in a few minutes.

41:43.632 --> 41:44.501
But you know what,

41:45.635 --> 41:47.505
I got no more
words for you, man.

41:55.679 --> 41:59.517
You know, CJ's mom got
pregnant when we were 17.

42:00.849 --> 42:02.853
Everybody thought we'd
end up on welfare.

42:04.688 --> 42:05.556
But not me.

42:06.657 --> 42:09.856
Her father thought that
I'd either end up in jail

42:09.858 --> 42:11.291
or in hell, and he hoped

42:11.293 --> 42:13.096
that I wouldn't
drag her with me.

42:16.365 --> 42:17.898
And now I'm a judge.

42:17.900 --> 42:19.103
What'd he say to that?

42:20.103 --> 42:21.702
I don't know, I don't care.

42:21.704 --> 42:25.241
Look, I never had to beg
anybody for anything in my life.

42:27.643 --> 42:29.546
Now I've already asked
you for help once.

42:30.246 --> 42:31.682
That's all I'm gonna do.

42:32.849 --> 42:34.315
So you're a judge,
you come down here

42:34.317 --> 42:36.284
and want me to help you?

42:36.286 --> 42:37.186
Help you to do what?

42:42.659 --> 42:43.294
Sue the city.

42:49.865 --> 42:50.833
Think about it?

42:56.706 --> 42:59.206
I don't need to man, I'm good.

42:59.208 --> 43:00.210
All right.

43:06.882 --> 43:07.717
Thanks.

43:23.867 --> 43:25.365
Yes?

43:25.367 --> 43:27.702
CDI, Officer
Petty is on the line.

43:27.704 --> 43:29.836
He wants to know if the
information released

43:29.838 --> 43:31.208
has been confirmed.

43:39.882 --> 43:42.885
Heavy is the heart of the
hero that protects the city.

43:46.188 --> 43:47.722
Tell him yes.

43:47.724 --> 43:48.923
Yes sir.

43:48.925 --> 43:50.961
I'm gonna head home
now, it's almost day.

43:52.228 --> 43:55.331
All right, Anne,
have a good night.

44:18.887 --> 44:19.922
Stop, stop.

44:21.990 --> 44:22.893
What?

44:25.728 --> 44:26.396
What?

44:28.931 --> 44:30.099
Come on, talk to me.

44:31.266 --> 44:32.135
I can't.

44:33.902 --> 44:34.936
Come on.

44:34.938 --> 44:36.907
You don't sleep anymore.

44:38.240 --> 44:39.840
You're drinking so much.

44:39.842 --> 44:41.377
You don't spend any
time with your son.

44:42.878 --> 44:44.947
It was my gun, Marilyn.

44:46.048 --> 44:46.782
My bullets.

44:50.853 --> 44:52.889
That kid didn't even have,

44:55.257 --> 44:56.125
What?

44:57.527 --> 44:59.229
He didn't have what?

45:00.996 --> 45:02.896
Oh my.

45:02.898 --> 45:04.898
Rory did it for us.

45:04.900 --> 45:05.902
Oh my god.

45:10.139 --> 45:11.271
Did you tell anyone?

45:11.273 --> 45:12.340
Nobody.

45:12.342 --> 45:13.277
Oh my god.

45:15.911 --> 45:17.345
My god, you killed that kid.

45:17.347 --> 45:18.749
You need to tell someone.

45:19.481 --> 45:20.514
No.

45:20.516 --> 45:22.883
Yes, no, what do you mean no?

45:22.885 --> 45:25.952
No, you are not living in my
house with my son with that.

45:25.954 --> 45:27.220
That's, no.

45:27.222 --> 45:28.121
This is my house.

45:28.123 --> 45:30.191
No, no.

45:30.193 --> 45:32.894
My husband was not a coward.

45:32.896 --> 45:34.528
Was not afraid to
do the right thing.

45:34.530 --> 45:37.130
You are, you are not my husband.

45:37.132 --> 45:38.900
I am doing the right thing.

45:38.902 --> 45:39.900
Rory was protecting us.

45:39.902 --> 45:41.235
It's us and them, Mary.

45:41.237 --> 45:42.403
It's always been us and them.

45:42.405 --> 45:43.503
It's not.

45:43.505 --> 45:44.907
It's right and wrong.

45:46.275 --> 45:48.411
And not being a coward
to do what's right.

45:49.878 --> 45:51.214
I wasn't, I,

45:54.818 --> 45:55.416
I was trying...

45:55.418 --> 45:56.284
Don't, don't.

45:56.286 --> 45:58.021
Just don't touch me.

46:49.606 --> 46:50.604
Yes, Marcy.

46:50.606 --> 46:52.405
My name is Judge
Charles Coleman.

46:52.407 --> 46:56.012
I was wondering if we could
speak about your son Jaylen.

46:58.514 --> 47:01.282
So thank you for
coming to see me.

47:01.284 --> 47:03.253
I wanted to talk
about your son Jaylen.

47:04.887 --> 47:07.220
You know, Mr.
Coleman, I came to peace

47:07.222 --> 47:09.155
with this mess years ago.

47:09.157 --> 47:12.025
And nothing now is
gonna bring Jaylen back.

47:12.027 --> 47:12.929
Nothing.

47:14.264 --> 47:16.563
So you're just gonna
let them get away with it?

47:16.565 --> 47:17.400
They won't.

47:25.641 --> 47:27.508
Whatever hurt you
have in your heart,

47:27.510 --> 47:30.110
this gives comfort.

47:30.112 --> 47:32.146
It's helped me to
forgive those men.

47:32.148 --> 47:33.981
And it's in God's hands now.

47:33.983 --> 47:34.918
Marcy.

47:35.985 --> 47:37.253
We can get justice.

47:38.387 --> 47:40.387
Real solid justice.

47:40.389 --> 47:42.657
We can make them pay
for what they did.

47:42.659 --> 47:43.592
Now.

47:43.594 --> 47:45.159
Justice is nothing
more than a fancy way

47:45.161 --> 47:47.695
of saying you get
what you deserve.

47:47.697 --> 47:48.929
I disagree.

47:48.931 --> 47:50.664
Justice restores balance.

47:50.666 --> 47:52.432
Okay, it's legal.

47:52.434 --> 47:54.434
Revenge does not,
revenge is illegal.

47:54.436 --> 47:55.938
You mean an eye for an eye?

47:57.039 --> 47:59.407
What makes it okay
to take one man's eye

47:59.409 --> 48:01.943
and yet the very same act

48:01.945 --> 48:03.711
of taking another
man's eye illegal?

48:03.713 --> 48:05.412
We don't take an eye
for an eye anymore.

48:05.414 --> 48:08.282
We don't live in biblical times.

48:08.284 --> 48:10.418
No judge, you take years

48:10.420 --> 48:12.353
for stealing a two
dollar loaf of bread

48:12.355 --> 48:16.157
or prisons forever for
one felony conviction.

48:16.159 --> 48:19.528
I actually think the eye for
an eye is more equitable.

48:22.731 --> 48:24.264
Okay, well, uh,

48:24.266 --> 48:26.733
thank you for making the trip.

48:26.735 --> 48:29.272
I'll let you know when
the DA begins prosecution.

48:30.706 --> 48:33.943
And uh, you can decide then
if you want to pursue it.

48:35.043 --> 48:37.577
Judge, if you fixate
on getting justice,

48:37.579 --> 48:39.746
you'll forget how to live.

48:39.748 --> 48:43.119
And living is the best
way we can honor our boys.

48:48.358 --> 48:49.359
Could I ask you,

48:50.425 --> 48:51.992
never mind.

48:51.994 --> 48:54.297
No, what were
you going to say?

48:55.731 --> 48:57.934
Why do you live where you
live, in that neighborhood?

49:00.302 --> 49:01.769
What did you expect?

49:01.771 --> 49:04.637
Gold teeth and improper
verb conjugation?

49:04.639 --> 49:05.606
I'm sorry.

49:05.608 --> 49:08.575
I made one of those
mistakes we discussed.

49:08.577 --> 49:11.380
17, riding in a stolen car.

49:12.547 --> 49:14.715
We didn't have money
for a real lawyer.

49:14.717 --> 49:15.550
So I took a plea.

49:17.586 --> 49:19.387
And you know what he
forgot to tell me?

49:19.389 --> 49:21.287
That I'd be a felon.

49:21.289 --> 49:22.757
Not allowed to vote.

49:22.759 --> 49:25.458
Not allowed financial
aid for school.

49:25.460 --> 49:30.296
So I graduated valedictorian,
couldn't go to college,

49:30.298 --> 49:31.300
couldn't get a job.

49:32.434 --> 49:36.804
So here I am, a woman, a felon.

49:36.806 --> 49:39.242
That's my future for one felony.

49:40.643 --> 49:41.744
So is that justice?

50:10.639 --> 50:12.740
Where are you going?

50:12.742 --> 50:15.512
Oh, uh, nowhere.

50:17.112 --> 50:17.744
To Ralphie's.

50:17.746 --> 50:19.847
Ralphie's closed.

50:19.849 --> 50:22.816
Not tonight it's not closed.

50:22.818 --> 50:24.186
Are you sure?

50:34.463 --> 50:35.431
You know,

50:37.467 --> 50:39.769
how can you stand to
look at me every day?

50:42.204 --> 50:44.740
The cops killed our son
and I didn't do anything.

50:45.875 --> 50:46.777
I mean we just,

50:48.744 --> 50:51.778
went on with our lives
like it never happened.

50:51.780 --> 50:52.847
I miss him.

50:52.849 --> 50:55.052
God knows I miss him.

50:57.719 --> 50:58.754
But Ralph made a choice.

51:00.255 --> 51:01.722
He chose a life
that we were trying

51:01.724 --> 51:03.059
to protect him from.

51:04.260 --> 51:08.195
You say that, but
babe, there's a ghost

51:08.197 --> 51:12.733
that's always here,
always around.

51:12.735 --> 51:14.767
No matter how much we
smile or how much we live,

51:14.769 --> 51:16.871
how much we go on,

51:16.873 --> 51:18.472
there's something
that floats around

51:18.474 --> 51:20.277
and finds its way between us.

51:21.476 --> 51:22.476
You know, you pretend
that you don't feel it

51:22.478 --> 51:23.613
but I know that you do.

51:30.719 --> 51:33.521
The only thing I wanna feel,

51:33.523 --> 51:38.528
that I wanna see is you

51:39.695 --> 51:42.298
coming back to me every night.

51:53.476 --> 51:58.481
I'll see you tonight.

52:01.751 --> 52:02.586
Evie!

52:03.853 --> 52:05.418
Eve?

52:05.420 --> 52:06.789
Oh, there you are.

52:12.327 --> 52:13.262
I got this.

52:14.797 --> 52:15.862
What's all this?

52:15.864 --> 52:17.266
Where's your phone?

52:17.967 --> 52:19.465
Charging.

52:19.467 --> 52:21.303
Charging, good,
well leave it there

52:23.206 --> 52:28.211
because I am treating
my wife tonight

52:28.878 --> 52:32.782
to a Chinese gourmet dinner.

52:33.983 --> 52:34.885
From Hai Cheng's?

52:37.485 --> 52:39.288

Have you seen the news?

55:27.789 --> 55:29.389
They said that CJ had a gun.

55:29.391 --> 55:30.724
They're saying he
was a street kid.

55:30.726 --> 55:31.528
Please call me.

55:54.115 --> 55:54.983
Hey.

56:11.833 --> 56:13.669
They're calling CJ a thug.

56:14.836 --> 56:18.407
Telling everyone that
our son was a criminal!

56:20.909 --> 56:22.511
And he deserved to be killed!

56:23.445 --> 56:24.177
I know, I know.

56:24.179 --> 56:25.013
I'm handling it.

56:29.652 --> 56:30.753
You left me.

56:32.054 --> 56:33.856
Like you don't care, alone.

56:40.028 --> 56:42.931
It's been over six
months, Charles.

56:44.666 --> 56:45.833
You've done nothing!

56:45.835 --> 56:48.769
I'm trying, I have tried.

56:48.771 --> 56:50.170
Since when do you try?

56:50.172 --> 56:51.804
You always do.

56:51.806 --> 56:53.773
You wanted to get a
high school diploma

56:53.775 --> 56:55.943
despite me being
pregnant and you did.

56:55.945 --> 56:58.744
You wanted to finish
college, you did.

56:58.746 --> 57:00.179
You wanted to be
a lawyer, you did.

57:00.181 --> 57:01.815
A judge, you did.

57:01.817 --> 57:03.019
A great father you were.

57:03.985 --> 57:06.186
So forgive me Charles.

57:06.188 --> 57:08.655
If you really wanted to be a man

57:08.657 --> 57:11.657
and gain justice
for CJ, you would.

57:11.659 --> 57:12.895
You wouldn't try!

57:14.195 --> 57:16.732
Eve, it's not that simple.

57:23.038 --> 57:24.940
Our son, your system,

57:26.842 --> 57:30.180
Mr. Charles Coleman
Senior, our protector.

57:32.014 --> 57:36.085
Thank you so much for
gaining justice for my son.

57:53.835 --> 57:54.937
You are slave.

57:56.672 --> 57:59.273
You are not the man I married.

57:59.275 --> 58:02.644
I don't know what
you need me to do.

58:34.842 --> 58:36.809
Mr. Mayor.

58:36.811 --> 58:37.644
Do you have a minute?

58:37.646 --> 58:38.648
Hey judge.

58:40.782 --> 58:42.682
Big city council
meeting tonight.

58:42.684 --> 58:45.351
Have to improve the city
revitalization project.

58:45.353 --> 58:46.320
Right, I understand.

58:46.322 --> 58:47.354
This'll just take five minutes.

58:47.356 --> 58:49.559
I'm sure you could use a break.

58:51.293 --> 58:52.858
All right.

58:52.860 --> 58:54.927
We'll pick up in 15.

58:54.929 --> 58:56.896
- Will you get me a cup of joe?
- Mhmm.

58:56.898 --> 58:57.965
Honey.

58:57.967 --> 58:58.867
Two cream.

59:01.103 --> 59:03.903
You see the news this morning?

59:03.905 --> 59:05.171
Unfortunately, I did.

59:05.173 --> 59:07.941
And I promise you, we're
hunting down the leaker

59:07.943 --> 59:09.078
like the dog they are.

59:10.646 --> 59:11.280
Okay.

59:13.949 --> 59:15.182
How about this, you seen this?

59:15.184 --> 59:15.952
Yeah.

59:17.318 --> 59:18.751
I curse the day
the gun was made.

59:18.753 --> 59:20.222
But we find ourselves
in need these days.

59:24.659 --> 59:26.092
- How about that?
- Another angle of the gun.

59:26.094 --> 59:27.860
What's the point?

59:27.862 --> 59:30.697
These are two completely
different crime scenes

59:30.699 --> 59:31.865
two years apart.

59:31.867 --> 59:32.835
The same gun.

59:34.802 --> 59:37.706
Okay, Ralphie Garcia,
Charles Coleman II.

59:40.074 --> 59:41.374
How did you find this?

59:41.376 --> 59:42.909
Rory Carter was
at both scenes.

59:42.911 --> 59:44.945
The same style of gun.

59:44.947 --> 59:46.715
Where did you get these?

59:50.652 --> 59:53.153
These are two black guns

59:53.155 --> 59:55.155
with the serial
number scratched off.

59:55.157 --> 59:57.691
There are thousands of
those in this city alone.

59:57.693 --> 01:00:00.026
What are the results
of the fingerprint test?

01:00:00.028 --> 01:00:01.695
What?

01:00:01.697 --> 01:00:03.865
Did you end up checking
the gun for CJ's prints?

01:00:04.867 --> 01:00:08.969
Charles, just
leave this alone.

01:00:08.971 --> 01:00:10.704
This is bigger than me.

01:00:10.706 --> 01:00:11.874
It's not bigger than you!

01:00:13.242 --> 01:00:15.675
Your cops shot my son.

01:00:15.677 --> 01:00:16.842
How is that bigger than you?

01:00:16.844 --> 01:00:18.878
That's not what I'm saying.

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:20.914
What am I supposed
to tell my wife?

01:00:20.916 --> 01:00:23.849
I made her a promise that
I would take care of her

01:00:23.851 --> 01:00:24.950
and my son.

01:00:24.952 --> 01:00:26.922
My son is gone.

01:00:28.356 --> 01:00:30.824
She's all I have left.

01:00:30.826 --> 01:00:32.161
What am I supposed to tell her?

01:00:33.695 --> 01:00:34.327
Answer me!

01:00:34.329 --> 01:00:35.365
Wake up, man!

01:00:36.864 --> 01:00:37.831
This is the best we got.

01:00:37.833 --> 01:00:38.766
The city tried.

01:00:38.768 --> 01:00:40.967
We offered you money,
something as a token.

01:00:40.969 --> 01:00:42.070
You said no!

01:00:48.876 --> 01:00:50.980
Token sounds right about now.

01:00:53.882 --> 01:00:54.817
All right.

01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:01.121
Get me the number
to judicial ethics.

01:01:01.123 --> 01:01:01.958
Yes sir.

01:01:07.896 --> 01:01:09.295
Where
are people like me,

01:01:09.297 --> 01:01:12.432
better yet, people who know
a lot less than me to turn?

01:01:12.434 --> 01:01:13.467
They're our kids.

01:01:13.469 --> 01:01:15.202
We gotta believe them, right?

01:01:15.204 --> 01:01:16.869
We offered you
money, something as a token,

01:01:16.871 --> 01:01:17.839
you said no!

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:32.885
Lost again?

01:01:32.887 --> 01:01:34.121
We gotta stop this, then.

01:01:34.123 --> 01:01:35.088
Stop what?

01:01:35.090 --> 01:01:35.988
Them!

01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:37.124
No more.

01:01:37.126 --> 01:01:38.958
No more, it's done.

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:40.126
What are you talking about?

01:01:40.128 --> 01:01:41.994
No, look, this is real.

01:01:41.996 --> 01:01:44.530
This isn't some fake
made up gang beef

01:01:44.532 --> 01:01:46.001
over who owns the block!

01:01:46.969 --> 01:01:48.267
This is my life!

01:01:48.269 --> 01:01:49.970
Listen man, you
don't know nothing

01:01:49.972 --> 01:01:51.204
about what goes on out here.

01:01:51.206 --> 01:01:52.171
Why don't you go back
to where you live,

01:01:52.173 --> 01:01:53.373
Fancyland, wherever that is.

01:01:53.375 --> 01:01:54.242
You think I've
always been a judge?

01:01:55.878 --> 01:01:56.946
'Cause you don't know me.

01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:00.880
You have no idea what I've
had to do to get here.

01:02:00.882 --> 01:02:02.484
So don't play me like that.

01:02:04.987 --> 01:02:05.885
Go home.

01:02:05.887 --> 01:02:07.186
No!

01:02:07.188 --> 01:02:10.222
You can't even look at
a photo of your son.

01:02:10.224 --> 01:02:11.891
Then you're gonna name
a building after him

01:02:11.893 --> 01:02:14.126
hoping that it makes
you feel better.

01:02:14.128 --> 01:02:15.896
Well how's that
working out for you?

01:02:15.898 --> 01:02:17.063
You feel better?

01:02:17.065 --> 01:02:19.833
Listen, judge or
not, you're pushing it.

01:02:19.835 --> 01:02:21.001
I'm pushing it?

01:02:21.003 --> 01:02:22.101
- Yeah you're pushing it.
- What am I pushing?

01:02:22.103 --> 01:02:22.936
You're pushing it!

01:02:22.938 --> 01:02:23.905
I'm not pushing you!

01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:25.875
You let them.

01:02:28.409 --> 01:02:31.813
You let those
people kill your son

01:02:33.347 --> 01:02:35.347
and didn't do a thing about it.

01:02:35.349 --> 01:02:37.886
If that doesn't push you,
I don't know what will.

01:02:40.322 --> 01:02:42.889
As a courtesy, I'm
gonna let you leave.

01:02:42.891 --> 01:02:44.126
Don't ever come back here.

01:02:46.961 --> 01:02:47.896
Go home.

01:02:52.266 --> 01:02:53.068
Did you?

01:02:55.269 --> 01:02:57.273
Did you even see the
crime scene footage?

01:02:59.208 --> 01:03:00.009
What?

01:03:05.146 --> 01:03:07.213
This is what happens
when you get a gangster

01:03:07.215 --> 01:03:10.016
who's wearing that
silver on his chest.

01:03:38.914 --> 01:03:42.852
The thing is, your
son didn't have a gun.

01:03:46.288 --> 01:03:48.925
The gun that they said they
saw at your son's crime scene

01:03:50.224 --> 01:03:53.929
is the same gun they said
was at my son's crime scene.

01:04:16.550 --> 01:04:18.952
I just saw my son die.

01:04:18.954 --> 01:04:20.523
I'm so sorry.

01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:26.429
I just saw my son die.

01:04:35.170 --> 01:04:36.670
Why would you show me that?

01:04:36.672 --> 01:04:37.604
I'm sorry, I, I,

01:04:37.606 --> 01:04:38.805
Why would
you show that to me?

01:04:38.807 --> 01:04:41.708
- Why do you wanna shoot me?
- Why would you show me that?

01:04:41.710 --> 01:04:43.409
You're a judge, man,
you let that happen.

01:04:43.411 --> 01:04:44.880
I'm not a judge anymore.

01:04:46.547 --> 01:04:48.149
Right now I'm just a father.

01:04:49.418 --> 01:04:52.552
I'm a father who let
his son down too.

01:04:52.554 --> 01:04:54.720
Why shouldn't I
shoot you right now?

01:04:54.722 --> 01:04:56.021
Why shouldn't I drop you?

01:04:56.023 --> 01:04:56.925
You could.

01:05:02.530 --> 01:05:04.900
Or you could ride with me.

01:05:05.733 --> 01:05:07.400
Ride?

01:05:07.402 --> 01:05:08.735
You're a gangster?

01:05:08.737 --> 01:05:11.007
For my son, I can be.

01:05:14.009 --> 01:05:16.177
I have to make this right.

01:05:17.346 --> 01:05:20.016
I can't be in this hell anymore.

01:05:32.728 --> 01:05:36.097
How do we make this
right, law school?

01:05:36.998 --> 01:05:38.164
I thought about this.

01:05:38.166 --> 01:05:39.235
I've tried their way.

01:05:40.668 --> 01:05:43.570
I gave the system a chance
to respond and they didn't.

01:05:43.572 --> 01:05:45.704
So we have a choice
just to let things stand

01:05:45.706 --> 01:05:48.411
or do something to
make them take notice.

01:05:51.012 --> 01:05:52.445
This
one killed my boy.

01:05:52.447 --> 01:05:54.182
I've done worse
for less, I'm down.

01:05:55.751 --> 01:05:56.652
Who's playing?

01:05:57.485 --> 01:05:59.719
We
confront them, his men,

01:05:59.721 --> 01:06:01.257
force them to face us.

01:06:02.157 --> 01:06:03.222
And I know where they are.

01:06:03.224 --> 01:06:05.425
I've watched them, study them.

01:06:05.427 --> 01:06:08.360
The older visits an old
man and takes him cigars,

01:06:08.362 --> 01:06:09.698
the expensive kind.

01:06:10.565 --> 01:06:13.369
And goes home, drinks, alone.

01:06:14.735 --> 01:06:17.973
The young one puts his kid to
bed and watches TV all night.

01:06:18.806 --> 01:06:21.176
We go in, redeem our sons.

01:06:22.744 --> 01:06:25.177
The response time in that
neighborhood is two minutes

01:06:25.179 --> 01:06:26.047
in and out.

01:06:27.248 --> 01:06:30.182
While they're distracted, we'll
catch the other one at home.

01:06:30.184 --> 01:06:33.389
So to answer your question,
how do we make this right,

01:06:35.157 --> 01:06:37.059
we have to do something
revolutionary.

01:07:10.324 --> 01:07:15.330

We won't speak

No wives, no
doctors, no priests.

01:08:24.332 --> 01:08:29.337
Nah.

01:08:31.404 --> 01:08:32.671
You all right?

01:08:32.673 --> 01:08:33.772
Your hand is shaking
like Freddie Roach.

01:08:33.774 --> 01:08:34.874
Yeah,
I'm good, I'm good.

01:08:34.876 --> 01:08:36.608
No, you don't look good.

01:08:36.609 --> 01:08:38.343
Don't want you shooting me
with that shaky ass hand.

01:08:38.345 --> 01:08:39.578
That's not funny.

01:08:39.581 --> 01:08:42.149
It's not funny, I
don't wanna get shot.

01:10:15.476 --> 01:10:18.814
You come in my house,
my place of peace!

01:10:20.481 --> 01:10:21.848
Come on!

01:10:21.850 --> 01:10:22.785
Get up!

01:10:24.019 --> 01:10:25.788
You done fucked up!

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:40.732
Where do you think you're going?

01:10:41.703 --> 01:10:43.839
Might as well have a seat now.

01:10:46.807 --> 01:10:48.143
So who's our guest of honor?

01:10:52.012 --> 01:10:53.446
You killed my boy!

01:10:53.448 --> 01:10:55.348
So how about I kill you too?

01:11:24.378 --> 01:11:25.046
Hey.

01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:27.849
Sounds like Rory's.

01:11:30.085 --> 01:11:30.886
Judge Coleman.

01:11:32.119 --> 01:11:34.086
Didn't expect to see
you here like this.

01:11:34.088 --> 01:11:36.589
I'd say your out
of your element.

01:11:36.591 --> 01:11:37.490
You should have
expected to see me

01:11:37.492 --> 01:11:38.761
the day you killed my boy.

01:11:41.029 --> 01:11:42.762
See now you've
put us on a path

01:11:42.764 --> 01:11:44.796
where only one of us
will walk away tonight

01:11:44.798 --> 01:11:46.098
and tell what happened.

01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:47.633
I'm not telling anybody.

01:11:47.635 --> 01:11:49.438
And you're taking
this to your grave.

01:11:50.572 --> 01:11:51.472
Oh, fuck.

01:12:09.791 --> 01:12:11.557
My daddy didn't teach
me much in life.

01:12:11.559 --> 01:12:13.893
But he did teach me two things.

01:12:13.895 --> 01:12:16.495
How to enjoy a Cuban cigar.

01:12:16.497 --> 01:12:18.764
I'm not taking about
that fake shit.

01:12:18.766 --> 01:12:23.135
Leaves grown from Cuban seeds
in Central American soil.

01:12:23.137 --> 01:12:26.505
If it ain't Cuban
soil, it ain't Cuban,

01:12:26.507 --> 01:12:27.773
he used to say.

01:12:27.775 --> 01:12:31.510
See it's the soil
that breathes it life.

01:12:31.512 --> 01:12:34.817
And two, always pick a side.

01:12:36.016 --> 01:12:38.817
When you do, you fight
like hell for it.

01:12:38.819 --> 01:12:39.854
Which side am I on?

01:12:41.488 --> 01:12:43.822
When you're on the
bench, you're on mine.

01:12:43.824 --> 01:12:44.926
I would have died for you.

01:12:48.829 --> 01:12:52.598
But for the record, if
I knew it was your boy,

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:54.567
it would have went
down differently.

01:12:54.569 --> 01:12:55.637
Yeah, but it didn't.

01:12:56.770 --> 01:12:58.806
No, it didn't.

01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:09.751
Guess we better
get this over with.

01:13:17.625 --> 01:13:19.157
Now look at me.

01:13:19.159 --> 01:13:20.061
Look at me.

01:13:21.496 --> 01:13:22.398
Look at me!

01:13:36.043 --> 01:13:39.512
I told you you're
out your depth.

01:13:39.514 --> 01:13:42.714
Talk about a justified killing.

01:13:42.716 --> 01:13:44.185
Not only am I gonna
get my pension

01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:47.623
but I'm gonna get
myself a medal of valor.

01:13:48.823 --> 01:13:50.793
God you guys went
from sugar to shit.

01:13:53.994 --> 01:13:56.062
Go ahead and kill me, man.

01:13:56.064 --> 01:13:58.667
Fuck, I'm already dead, fuck.

01:13:59.801 --> 01:14:01.067
The day you killed my
son, you killed me.

01:14:01.069 --> 01:14:02.535
Okay.

01:14:15.850 --> 01:14:17.186
You all right?

01:14:40.007 --> 01:14:42.610
What happened to your mask?

01:14:44.878 --> 01:14:46.081
I wanted him to
know it was me.

01:14:49.317 --> 01:14:51.851
How do you feel?

01:14:51.853 --> 01:14:53.521
I don't know, I,

01:14:56.890 --> 01:14:58.626
I stopped shaking.

01:15:02.262 --> 01:15:05.330
You think our boys
will be proud?

01:15:05.332 --> 01:15:06.799
I don't know.

01:15:06.801 --> 01:15:09.936
But they would know
that we love them.

Mother fucker killed
a cop on his own house.

01:15:29.856 --> 01:15:30.826
Stevens.

01:15:31.859 --> 01:15:33.092
Black suped up car pulled out.

01:15:33.094 --> 01:15:35.794
Two males, one
black, one unknown.

01:15:48.943 --> 01:15:50.045
What you got, boss?

01:15:55.882 --> 01:15:57.316
We need to find Von Clements.

01:16:07.328 --> 01:16:08.794
Officer Clements?

01:16:08.796 --> 01:16:09.695
You need to come with us.

01:16:09.697 --> 01:16:11.030
Why, I'm on leave?

01:16:11.032 --> 01:16:14.066
Horace
Stevens needs you.

01:16:14.068 --> 01:16:15.334
Stevens, I never
said anything to him.

01:16:15.336 --> 01:16:16.869
You gotta clear
that up with him.

01:16:16.871 --> 01:16:17.873
We need to go.

01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:22.741
- I can't leave my son.
- We'll have an officer here.

01:16:22.743 --> 01:16:23.644
We need to go now.

01:16:26.079 --> 01:16:27.349
Okay, let me
just grab my fare.

01:16:36.189 --> 01:16:39.357
Hey, when was the last
time you saw Charles?

01:16:39.359 --> 01:16:40.228
Earlier.

01:16:41.762 --> 01:16:43.230
- Do you know where he is?
- No.

01:16:44.198 --> 01:16:45.634
A cop was killed.

01:16:46.333 --> 01:16:48.768
They found CJ's ID there.

01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:50.969
He wants to do
the right thing.

01:16:50.971 --> 01:16:51.939
Is he okay?

01:16:56.877 --> 01:16:58.112
I don't know.

01:17:00.782 --> 01:17:02.281
All point bulletin.

01:17:02.283 --> 01:17:05.351
Suspect identified as
Charles Coleman Senior.

01:17:05.353 --> 01:17:06.688
Black male, 26.

01:17:07.854 --> 01:17:09.354
Records say he's a judge.

01:17:09.356 --> 01:17:10.856
Seen fleeing in a
black sports car

01:17:10.858 --> 01:17:13.925
with unknown male
with him, both armed.

01:17:13.927 --> 01:17:15.160
Scene double zero reported.

01:17:15.162 --> 01:17:18.866
2039 Fidelity drive,
air support requested.

01:17:22.703 --> 01:17:23.804
Yo man, where we at?

01:17:25.338 --> 01:17:27.973
Um I don't know,
some neighborhood.

01:17:27.975 --> 01:17:29.875
No, no, no, this
ain't no neighborhood.

01:17:29.877 --> 01:17:30.976
This is Parramore, man.

01:17:30.978 --> 01:17:32.847
I can't be out here.

01:17:34.881 --> 01:17:35.884
Why not?

01:17:37.452 --> 01:17:38.884
Is it our side?

01:17:38.886 --> 01:17:39.788
Mhmm.

01:17:41.889 --> 01:17:42.958
Be careful.

01:17:44.859 --> 01:17:45.827
Yeah.

01:17:46.961 --> 01:17:48.861
Hey, look,
look, look, look.

01:17:48.863 --> 01:17:50.295
I think that's them.

01:17:50.297 --> 01:17:51.897
We should pull them over.

01:17:51.899 --> 01:17:53.866
We ain't gonna be cowboys.

01:17:53.868 --> 01:17:55.300
Let's just get back
to headquarters.

01:17:55.302 --> 01:17:57.068
If it's them and we
don't pull them over,

01:17:57.070 --> 01:17:58.073
we'll all be fined.

01:17:59.073 --> 01:17:59.908
Maybe.

01:18:06.380 --> 01:18:08.113
They look a little nervous.

01:18:08.115 --> 01:18:08.981
Drive!

01:18:37.478 --> 01:18:38.713
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!

01:18:39.980 --> 01:18:41.849
I'm calling for
backup, stay here!

01:18:44.519 --> 01:18:45.353
Dammit!

01:19:59.627 --> 01:20:02.126
Stand down, stand down!

01:20:06.367 --> 01:20:07.900
You want some more?

01:20:26.621 --> 01:20:28.890
I told you to stand down!

01:20:40.902 --> 01:20:42.904
Damn, law school, that's,

01:20:44.604 --> 01:20:46.004
that's all right.

01:20:46.006 --> 01:20:48.143
I told you I'm gangster.

01:21:11.131 --> 01:21:14.633
Yeah,
my eye's swelling.

01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:22.243
Who the hell was that?

01:21:25.212 --> 01:21:26.544
Who's shooting!?

01:21:26.546 --> 01:21:28.680
Officer Washington,
you're under arrest.

01:21:28.682 --> 01:21:29.616
Where are my partners?

01:21:29.618 --> 01:21:32.418
They're alive, they
didn't kill our boys.

01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:35.090
Our beef's not with you or them.

01:21:36.222 --> 01:21:38.389
Listen, we're gonna
walk out of here

01:21:38.391 --> 01:21:40.394
like this didn't happen.

01:21:42.262 --> 01:21:44.932
Okay, we're walking out of here!

01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:07.922
Which way?

01:22:09.023 --> 01:22:09.925
Ah.

01:22:11.158 --> 01:22:12.027
Keep straight.

01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:15.029
It's in the bottoms.

01:22:19.567 --> 01:22:20.766
You said nobody
knows what's happening?

01:22:20.768 --> 01:22:21.767
You haven't heard?

01:22:21.769 --> 01:22:23.035
Heard what?

01:22:23.037 --> 01:22:25.173
Rory, someone took him out.

01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:42.720
Wait, that's him,
that's him right there.

01:22:42.722 --> 01:22:44.123
That's him.

01:22:44.125 --> 01:22:45.723
Wait a
minute, are you sure?

01:22:45.725 --> 01:22:47.692
Yeah, turn around.

01:22:47.694 --> 01:22:49.561
Glad this isn't over.

01:22:55.735 --> 01:22:58.504
This is much bigger
than our boys.

01:22:58.506 --> 01:23:00.571
Damn right.

01:23:09.115 --> 01:23:10.115
When?

01:23:10.117 --> 01:23:11.250
About an hour ago.

01:23:11.252 --> 01:23:13.652
Black male, all we know.

01:23:26.367 --> 01:23:27.732
Why is Stevens bringing me in?

01:23:27.734 --> 01:23:29.134
For your protection.

01:23:29.136 --> 01:23:30.669
Protection from what?

01:23:30.671 --> 01:23:31.503
The killer.

01:23:31.505 --> 01:23:32.771
You could be next.

01:23:32.773 --> 01:23:34.373
All we know.

01:23:34.375 --> 01:23:37.145
Sure, that's all you know.

01:24:14.381 --> 01:24:15.383
He's good.

01:24:18.319 --> 01:24:19.585
What are they doing?

01:24:19.587 --> 01:24:20.822
Should we fight
or should we go?

01:24:24.757 --> 01:24:25.726
Fuck it!

01:24:27.694 --> 01:24:29.294
Shit!

01:25:37.797 --> 01:25:39.932
Suspect
down, suspect is down.

01:25:39.934 --> 01:25:43.771
1050, all men under the
Plain Street bridge.

01:26:04.757 --> 01:26:06.793
You all right?

01:26:13.266 --> 01:26:14.769
Get out, get out.

01:26:20.975 --> 01:26:21.876
You got me?

01:26:25.345 --> 01:26:28.013
Suspects
located, suspects armed.

01:26:28.015 --> 01:26:31.750
1033, I repeat, 1033, we
need backup immediately.

01:26:31.752 --> 01:26:32.683
Let's go, go, go!

01:26:56.777 --> 01:26:58.876
Officer Von Clements.

01:26:58.878 --> 01:27:00.881
You are now being
tried for the murder

01:27:02.615 --> 01:27:04.750
of CJ Coleman Junior.

01:27:04.752 --> 01:27:07.488
And Rafael Garcia,
time to pay your penalty.

01:27:09.856 --> 01:27:11.589
I'm sorry for your loss.

01:27:11.591 --> 01:27:12.991
Fuck that.

01:27:12.993 --> 01:27:14.896
It's too late for
your fucking sorries.

01:27:22.770 --> 01:27:23.871
I have a son.

01:27:26.539 --> 01:27:27.975
I have a son, he's
six years old!

01:27:32.845 --> 01:27:35.782
JAVIER AND
CHARLES: I had a son.

01:27:39.953 --> 01:27:40.788
I know.

01:27:45.024 --> 01:27:46.860
I'm afraid, Charles.

01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:56.738
I want you to know that
CJ didn't have a gun.

01:28:01.774 --> 01:28:03.277
I'm sorry, judge.

01:28:21.895 --> 01:28:23.829
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

01:28:49.489 --> 01:28:50.488
I see them!
