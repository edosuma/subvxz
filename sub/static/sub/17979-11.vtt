01:02.760 --> 01:05.298
- She looks a little...
- Hang on, let me just pull it just here.

01:05.333 --> 01:07.538
- She must...
- We're still working on it.

01:07.910 --> 01:10.292
- This is just a brief cut.
- Okay.

01:11.594 --> 01:15.076
I never thought Bette would lie and cheat
and sneak around on me

01:15.111 --> 01:18.012
and treat me just as badly
as every man I've ever been with.

01:18.400 --> 01:20.745
I thought women would be better somehow.

01:29.072 --> 01:31.795
I know you're all sitting there
judging me.

01:33.411 --> 01:35.003
And I think I deserve it.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.261
I fucked up.

01:38.948 --> 01:40.770
There's something I need to say.

01:40.802 --> 01:42.366
- We should go.
- Yeah.

01:42.391 --> 01:44.123
- Absolutely.
- Stay.

01:44.160 --> 01:45.306
Please.

01:47.519 --> 01:51.490
If you have something to say,
go ahead, say it in front of our friends.

01:51.525 --> 01:54.133
Nina, I just left the plomber's house.

01:54.136 --> 01:55.313
You...

01:55.347 --> 01:58.151
- just came from her house...?
- I told her that I loved you.

01:58.726 --> 02:00.460
That you're the love of my life.

02:00.508 --> 02:02.300
And I'm never gonna see her again.

02:02.348 --> 02:04.071
If I'm the love of your life,

02:04.116 --> 02:05.770
what did you fuck her?!

02:13.987 --> 02:15.532
Bev...

02:15.567 --> 02:17.370
I'm so sorry, Nina.

02:17.407 --> 02:19.341
You shouldn't have cheated on me.

02:19.386 --> 02:21.923
What can I do to help you
to forgive me?

02:21.968 --> 02:24.471
We both need to set a time for us,

02:24.518 --> 02:26.070
for our relationship.

02:26.117 --> 02:27.573
I want to, Nina.

02:28.617 --> 02:31.613
I don't wanna lose you.
We belong together.

02:36.766 --> 02:40.302
Thank God. I don't know
what I would have done if they'd split up.

02:40.347 --> 02:42.211
They're like the best couple
that ever lived. They really are.

02:42.218 --> 02:45.060
They're role models for the rest of us.

02:45.098 --> 02:47.203
An example for the straight world.

02:47.847 --> 02:50.503
There's one more good reason
why we should stay together.

02:50.536 --> 02:52.153
What's that?

02:52.188 --> 02:54.010
I'm gonna have your baby!

02:56.057 --> 02:57.343
Oh, no!

03:02.317 --> 03:03.561
So, what do you think?

03:03.605 --> 03:05.502
I think I need some things to work.

03:05.545 --> 03:08.502
I just have a few notes
if you can go back to the second to...

04:12.026 --> 04:14.090
- "Medicine Bend" by Margie Joseph -

04:18.036 --> 04:20.019
Tom and Jodi are in touch.

04:20.067 --> 04:21.622
She emailed him.

04:21.668 --> 04:23.373
She's staying with a friend.

04:25.115 --> 04:26.730
It's good that she has friends.

04:26.768 --> 04:28.323
Yeah, but we are her friends too.

04:29.735 --> 04:32.241
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude.
Apologies.

04:32.277 --> 04:33.462
I'm sorry. I'm

04:34.237 --> 04:35.831
{\a6}having a day.

04:38.536 --> 04:40.153
Did he say which friend?

04:40.186 --> 04:42.592
I'm not sure. Amy maybe.

04:46.088 --> 04:47.853
Have you not spoken to her at all?

04:50.098 --> 04:52.283
She hasn't returned any of my messages.

04:52.326 --> 04:55.313
- Oh! Would you blame her?
- I'm not blaming her.

04:55.355 --> 04:57.121
Ladies, please, don't fight.

04:57.137 --> 04:58.902
{\a6}I can't stand it when sisters do that.

04:58.905 --> 05:01.643
{\a6}Jenny, this isn't a scene in your movie.
You don't have to direct it.

05:01.675 --> 05:03.540
Stay out of it, Alice.

05:04.466 --> 05:06.152
{\a6}You are so PMS-ing. Please.

05:06.188 --> 05:09.071
{\a6}I'm not PMS-ing.
You're the one that's PMS-ing.

05:09.108 --> 05:12.151
{\a6}You've been flying off the handle
over every single thing this morning.

05:13.525 --> 05:15.690
I'm so glad I don't have
to go through that anymore.

05:16.106 --> 05:18.552
- I second that emotion.
- Tina,

05:18.597 --> 05:21.440
{\a6}- what time is my call today?
- I don't know your call time, okay?

05:21.477 --> 05:24.151
{\a6}This is the whole crew.
I don't know when everyone comes up.

05:25.687 --> 05:27.643
{\a6}Hello, ladies.

05:28.067 --> 05:30.521
Hey, gang's all here.
Look at that, babe.

05:31.396 --> 05:33.812
What's the matter?
You all look a little down.

05:34.327 --> 05:35.643
What is it?

05:35.677 --> 05:37.321
PMS?

05:37.358 --> 05:39.853
{\a6}Did you all sync up
on the Subaru pink ride?

05:39.885 --> 05:42.643
Look, uh, Denbo, what's up?

05:42.648 --> 05:44.382
{\a6}Are we still ???

05:44.416 --> 05:47.721
Oh, oh, yeah.
We're so very excited to tell you, guys.

05:48.448 --> 05:51.060
My lover Cindi and I met
an old friend of yours.

05:51.096 --> 05:53.680
Does the name Ivan Aycock ring a bell?

05:55.426 --> 05:57.903
{\a6}- You saw Ivan?
- Yeah.

05:57.947 --> 06:00.591
Wasn't easy to find ol' Ivan,
let me tell you,

06:00.637 --> 06:02.542
but I have my ways.

06:02.588 --> 06:04.353
Anyway, anyway. I tracked her down,

06:04.387 --> 06:05.600
{\a6}and uh,

06:05.638 --> 06:08.501
{\a6}God bless her,
she couldn't have been happier

06:08.547 --> 06:10.671
to unload her 51% of The Planet.

06:10.715 --> 06:14.182
I would say that she was actually
practically gleeful to sell it to me.

06:14.215 --> 06:17.723
- How fucking dare you?!
- You know what? Get the fuck out of here!

06:17.757 --> 06:20.062
{\a6}Oh, really? Oh, honey, they're telling us
to get the fuck out of here.

06:20.115 --> 06:23.383
{\a6}Well, you can't really tell us
to get the fucking out of here because

06:23.385 --> 06:24.922
we own this place.

06:25.827 --> 06:26.990
What?!

06:28.745 --> 06:30.603
- You motherfucking liar!
- Kit!

06:32.545 --> 06:34.623
Okay, okay, we're leaving.

06:34.668 --> 06:37.720
But we'll be back, with a decorator,
'cause I tell you,

06:37.768 --> 06:41.300
{\a6}this place does need
of a serious makeover. Ciao!

06:50.478 --> 06:52.810
Looks like somebody got here before me.

06:57.035 --> 07:00.310
- Jodi, I'm so sorry...
- Why is she talking to me?

07:00.358 --> 07:02.231
Doesn't she know I'm deaf?

07:23.097 --> 07:25.620
- Where do you wanna go?
- It's up to you.

07:27.077 --> 07:29.601
- You don't have a car?
- I've got called a cab.

07:33.127 --> 07:36.103
Well, I have some meetings
I need to reschedule.

07:36.146 --> 07:37.552
Do what you have to do.

07:43.285 --> 07:44.830
Hey, James, it's me.

07:46.515 --> 07:48.910
Listen, I have something
that I need to take care of this morning.

07:48.958 --> 07:50.912
Can you reschedule my morning meetings?

07:51.607 --> 07:53.782
Yes, the one with Phyllis.

07:55.336 --> 07:56.572
I don't care what you have to tell her.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.630
Just tell her
I have wicked P.M.S. I don't know.

07:58.695 --> 08:01.110
She probably doesn't even remember
what that feels like.

08:03.097 --> 08:04.471
Okay, great.

08:04.515 --> 08:06.042
Alright. Thank you.

08:06.075 --> 08:10.132
- Listen, if you have to go to work...
- No, I don't need to go to work.

08:10.616 --> 08:12.590
But I know how busy you are.

08:12.626 --> 08:14.752
And I don't want it
to be a problem for you.

08:14.787 --> 08:17.422
This is the most important thing
in the world to me.

08:17.458 --> 08:18.681
What is?

08:19.568 --> 08:21.070
This. You and me.

08:33.506 --> 08:34.921
Here is 20.

08:34.957 --> 08:37.121
No, no, no, it's okay. It's on me.

08:38.248 --> 08:40.432
Are you and Bette planning on
moving in together?

08:40.476 --> 08:41.913
No, we're not planning anything.

08:41.955 --> 08:44.100
I mean, she has to talk to Jodi first.

08:44.138 --> 08:46.281
You know, I gotta tell you, Tina,
I really respect you

08:46.316 --> 08:48.663
for showing some restraint
and holding back.

08:48.706 --> 08:49.771
I do.

08:49.817 --> 08:51.840
Well, it's about time.

08:52.467 --> 08:54.320
- Jesus!
- What?

08:55.076 --> 08:57.470
Jenny had an
art department meeting this morning,

08:57.506 --> 09:00.442
and she missed it,
and Adele went in her place instead.

09:01.038 --> 09:04.091
Wait, shouldn't Adele make sure
that Jenny knew about the meeting?

09:04.208 --> 09:06.100
Yeah, Max is right.
She should have told her.

09:07.106 --> 09:08.692
I'm sure she tried.

09:10.605 --> 09:13.473
I gotta go, you guys.
I gotta fix this.

09:13.475 --> 09:15.000
- 20?
- No, I...

09:17.567 --> 09:18.362
Oh, good.

09:31.555 --> 09:33.320
You don't get to do this.

09:33.357 --> 09:36.350
You have no right
to be the one who does this.

09:37.548 --> 09:39.090
I'm sorry.

09:39.126 --> 09:41.292
I'm sorry.

09:48.387 --> 09:51.101
{\a6}I never meant to...
I never meant for this to happen.

09:51.706 --> 09:53.020
What happened?

09:53.055 --> 09:55.200
I don't even know what's happening!

09:55.238 --> 09:58.880
Afterwards, I don't seem to know.
But I'm there to talk to you.

09:58.926 --> 10:00.891
Did you and that woman fuck?

10:00.936 --> 10:02.870
I don't know who you're talking about.

10:02.912 --> 10:05.586
Did you fuck her? Are you fucking?

10:05.611 --> 10:07.833
How long has this been going on?

10:07.830 --> 10:11.366
It's not about fucking.

10:16.969 --> 10:18.963
I don't know how it happened.

10:21.497 --> 10:23.223
I think that

10:23.265 --> 10:24.850
Tina and I, we just...

10:26.575 --> 10:28.760
we just never really finished,

10:28.806 --> 10:31.981
- you know, and we have Angelica...
- I know you have Angelica.

10:32.027 --> 10:34.571
But it isn't just about Angelica.

10:34.618 --> 10:38.831
We have so much history, and there's...

10:40.157 --> 10:43.012
I don't think that we realized

10:43.046 --> 10:45.741
how strong the connection...

10:48.006 --> 10:51.291
and there's just still so much
that hasn't been resolved.

10:51.336 --> 10:53.510
So fucking her resolved it?

10:53.557 --> 10:56.602
- I told you...
- Oh, I know. It's not about fuck.

10:56.647 --> 10:58.050
I know.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.483
Are you in love with her?

11:18.688 --> 11:21.782
- It's very complicated.
- Of course it's complicated.

11:21.787 --> 11:23.803
I'm asking if you love her.

11:25.627 --> 11:27.901
Yes. I love her.

11:39.515 --> 11:40.903
Do you love me?

11:46.096 --> 11:48.250
Yes, I love you. I do.

12:00.977 --> 12:03.021
No, no, no, no...

12:21.465 --> 12:23.453
I'm gonna fight for you.

12:28.427 --> 12:31.080
I like it. I mean,
it doesn't have as much character

12:31.126 --> 12:34.170
as my building, but, it's a house.
It will be our house.

12:39.506 --> 12:42.961
- The rent's way too expensive.
- It's not that expensive.

12:42.995 --> 12:45.641
It's eight times
of my apartment in Long Beach.

12:45.685 --> 12:46.610
Well,

12:47.696 --> 12:49.490
we'll be splitting the rent, so...

12:49.526 --> 12:51.951
Okay, well, four times as much.

12:51.987 --> 12:55.173
We don't have to split the rent
exactly down the middle.

12:55.215 --> 12:56.690
Yes we fuckin' do!

12:56.737 --> 12:58.730
If I get the job,
I'll be making a lot of money.

12:58.736 --> 13:00.842
Alice, can we just please keep looking?

13:01.515 --> 13:03.243
I hope you bleed soon.

13:03.288 --> 13:04.830
I really do.

13:15.766 --> 13:16.960
Fuck you!

15:06.568 --> 15:09.293
- Hi. Twelve in the morning.
- Okay, thanks.

15:16.937 --> 15:18.621
How was the bike ride?

15:19.638 --> 15:21.952
Oh, God, wow, it was...

15:22.908 --> 15:23.991
it was hard.

15:24.575 --> 15:27.391
Yeah, well, you're in good shape.

15:27.425 --> 15:29.673
Not really, I hell hope that was.

15:31.007 --> 15:32.680
So, so,

15:32.727 --> 15:34.220
how was your week end?

15:35.128 --> 15:37.631
- I'm ready to get back to work.
- Well, good. That's good.

15:37.668 --> 15:40.002
I think it's a problem
we won't worry about today.

15:40.036 --> 15:42.071
Niki be going a

15:42.078 --> 15:43.493
nightmare.

15:43.527 --> 15:44.920
You know what?

15:45.425 --> 15:47.250
I think everything's gonna be just fine.

15:47.327 --> 15:48.410
You do?

15:49.367 --> 15:53.843
I never thought I'd say this, but
I actually think that Jenny's got some...

15:54.575 --> 15:57.102
- Talent?
- She's making some

15:57.146 --> 15:59.601
really interesting stylistic choices and...

16:01.096 --> 16:02.861
Last night I was watching daylies

16:02.906 --> 16:06.630
and I thought to myself: "Oh my God!
We might have a really good movie".

16:09.067 --> 16:11.100
Can you come to the conference room, please?

16:11.148 --> 16:12.073
Sure.

16:16.825 --> 16:18.132
I'll see you on set.

16:27.097 --> 16:28.853
What is it now?

16:28.885 --> 16:30.280
Take a seat.

16:34.745 --> 16:37.681
Okay. Does someone wanna tell us
what this is all about?

16:53.075 --> 16:55.042
Here we go.

17:03.026 --> 17:05.349
- Harder?
- Harder, yeah.

17:07.075 --> 17:09.200
I love you fucking me.

17:09.237 --> 17:10.510
Enough.

17:11.518 --> 17:13.230
Enough! Cut it off!

17:16.795 --> 17:18.211
Who did this?

17:20.626 --> 17:24.369
Well, I think it's fair to say
that you and Niki did it.

17:24.905 --> 17:27.211
This was a private tape.

17:27.258 --> 17:30.731
- Who has seen this abomination?
- It's not an abomination.

17:30.806 --> 17:31.991
Nobody's seen it.

17:32.027 --> 17:33.083
Yet.

17:40.017 --> 17:42.352
There are 25 more copies.

17:42.385 --> 17:43.791
And each one of them is

17:43.836 --> 17:46.733
logged, addressed
and ready to go out to

17:46.766 --> 17:48.772
Letterman, Leno,

17:48.817 --> 17:51.221
Oprah, Ellen, Fox, E!,

17:51.258 --> 17:54.402
the National Enquirer, Star, Hola!, Hello,

17:54.445 --> 17:56.891
Perez Hilton...
but none of them have seen it yet,

17:56.937 --> 17:59.801
and frankly,
I would like to never have to send it.

17:59.836 --> 18:01.572
What is it that you want, Adele?

18:02.008 --> 18:03.260
Tina,

18:03.297 --> 18:05.783
look, this is not about what I want.

18:07.098 --> 18:11.151
This is about this film.
This is about "Lez Girls". This is about

18:11.188 --> 18:13.440
this incredibly important

18:13.477 --> 18:15.660
and powerful and significant film

18:15.708 --> 18:18.601
that has the opportunity to

18:18.645 --> 18:21.152
change hearts and minds and

18:21.195 --> 18:23.731
affect the lives of millions of people.

18:23.765 --> 18:25.190
And it mustn't

18:25.238 --> 18:27.520
be tainted by a scandal caused by the...

18:28.066 --> 18:31.313
the inexcusably reckless

18:31.995 --> 18:33.363
and tot...

18:34.066 --> 18:38.143
completely entitled behavior

18:38.185 --> 18:41.401
of the very few people
entrusted with this opportunity.

18:46.048 --> 18:48.152
I'm gonna call William,
and I'm gonna tell,

18:48.197 --> 18:51.071
I'm gonna tell him
what a disgusting ??? be.

18:52.865 --> 18:54.883
I've shown no one the tape,

18:54.927 --> 18:56.240
and

18:56.288 --> 18:59.633
I've spoken to William at length,

19:00.586 --> 19:03.152
and he agrees with me

19:04.065 --> 19:05.530
that

19:05.576 --> 19:08.382
the situation has become untenable.

19:09.507 --> 19:11.960
What is it that you want, Adele?

19:45.395 --> 19:50.252
- Stop. Jodi, stop! Stop!
- What?

19:50.295 --> 19:52.281
I can't do this.

19:53.258 --> 19:56.123
It's not right.
I don't want to do this with you.

20:02.226 --> 20:03.771
Fuck!

20:08.758 --> 20:11.581
- Where are you going?
- To go kill myself. Move!

20:11.628 --> 20:15.003
- Please, please don't do this.
- Let me go!

20:15.047 --> 20:16.493
I can't let you go.

20:16.996 --> 20:19.773
Why?
Can you make up your mind?

20:19.818 --> 20:21.721
I thought you wanted
to get rid of me!

20:21.818 --> 20:23.933
I can't let you go when
you're threatening to hurt yourself.

20:23.966 --> 20:26.220
I'm not going to kill myself over you.

20:26.237 --> 20:28.100
Don't flatter yourself.

20:28.138 --> 20:29.763
Jodi.

20:32.547 --> 20:34.602
I really care for you

20:34.635 --> 20:36.403
so deeply,

20:36.438 --> 20:40.931
but I am not going to walk away
and just turn my back on you

20:40.976 --> 20:42.361
and let you hate me.

20:43.035 --> 20:45.242
I'm going to fight for this relationship.

20:50.078 --> 20:51.362
Look,

20:52.356 --> 20:54.371
I have to go to school.

20:54.405 --> 20:57.931
- I have two meetings...
- Stop, stop, stop!

21:06.037 --> 21:08.220
So please, Bette,

21:08.256 --> 21:10.431
have some respect for me.

21:10.467 --> 21:13.853
I have total respect for you.
Now, what do you want me to do?

22:07.207 --> 22:08.700
Niki, come here.

22:08.737 --> 22:11.443
Niki, please come here.
I have to talk to you.

22:11.486 --> 22:13.753
- What? What's going on?
- We have to get out of here.

22:14.536 --> 22:15.462
What's wrong?

22:15.506 --> 22:19.030
Someone get their hold on that tape
that we made on the Pink Ride.

22:19.077 --> 22:21.790
And they're trying to extort
and blackmail the production.

22:21.876 --> 22:23.372
- Wait, wait...
- So we've got to get out of here.

22:23.478 --> 22:25.532
- What tape? The tape in the tent?
- Yes, this tape.

22:25.535 --> 22:27.200
- Jenny, get away from her! Niki?
- Oh my God!

22:27.246 --> 22:29.561
- Kevin, do you know about that?
- No, no, wait, Niki.

22:29.598 --> 22:31.022
- Get away from her.
- Kevin, do you...?

22:31.065 --> 22:33.720
- Yes, I do. Come here.
- He doesn't care about you.

22:33.766 --> 22:36.631
Don't listen to him.
He just cares about his fucking paycheck.

22:36.676 --> 22:39.493
He doesn't care about the movie
that we're trying to make, okay?

22:40.068 --> 22:42.861
I want, I want you guys to know
what's going on here.

22:42.906 --> 22:45.200
That these people are, they're,

22:45.235 --> 22:47.223
they're, they're traitors.

22:47.267 --> 22:49.323
And they're soulless.

22:49.348 --> 22:51.761
And they're trying to ruin this movie.

22:51.796 --> 22:54.231
Okay, that's enough. Alright.
Somebody call security right now.

22:54.278 --> 22:56.572
- Yeah, you heard him. Please.
- Wait!

22:56.618 --> 22:58.933
- Just give one second with her.
- So,

22:58.977 --> 23:01.200
if anybody has any integrity,

23:01.807 --> 23:03.460
come with me.

23:06.535 --> 23:08.372
You can come with me,

23:08.417 --> 23:11.302
you can stand up to these people.

23:14.196 --> 23:16.500
So, who wants to come with me?

23:20.055 --> 23:21.191
Who's...

23:21.228 --> 23:22.553
Hey,

23:22.588 --> 23:24.011
who's with me?

23:24.048 --> 23:25.202
I'm with you.

23:25.236 --> 23:27.191
Yeah? Great.

23:28.556 --> 23:30.240
Do you wanna come with me?

23:31.056 --> 23:33.903
Would you please escort
Miss Schecter out of the lot?

23:34.505 --> 23:36.771
Wait, wait, wait, just give me a second.

23:37.608 --> 23:39.462
Jenny, look at me.

23:39.508 --> 23:42.921
Please, come with me. Alright?
I am on your side.

23:42.958 --> 23:44.921
I promise you, I'm on your side.

23:44.937 --> 23:47.321
Let me walk you out of here.

23:47.915 --> 23:49.202
Please...

23:57.915 --> 23:58.990
Please.

24:01.035 --> 24:02.791
Please come with me?

24:06.088 --> 24:07.461
- Please...
- Shane...

24:07.495 --> 24:08.782
I'll talk to her.

24:10.078 --> 24:12.311
Niki, you're under contract.

24:14.527 --> 24:16.091
Come on. Let's go.

24:16.128 --> 24:18.322
Alright, everybody back to work.

24:18.365 --> 24:21.292
How are we supposed
to be back to work without a director?

24:25.577 --> 24:27.123
The director is here.

24:28.335 --> 24:30.500
- "Film Noir" by BETTY -

25:13.035 --> 25:15.730
Because our relationship will be unbalanced

25:15.765 --> 25:17.823
if you pay a bigger portion of the rent.

25:17.858 --> 25:19.422
I will be out of balance

25:19.458 --> 25:21.303
if you make me live in a shithole.

25:22.056 --> 25:23.502
A shithole?

25:24.177 --> 25:27.031
This is nicer than any place
I've ever lived in.

25:34.026 --> 25:36.451
Alright, we can talk about this later.

25:36.496 --> 25:38.631
After the taping. I have to get ready.

25:39.077 --> 25:41.340
We'll go for diner, or something.
I don't know.

25:41.388 --> 25:44.092
I'm going to Long Beach.
I don't know if I'll be back in time.

25:44.137 --> 25:45.500
You're not coming to my taping?

25:45.546 --> 25:47.661
I didn't know you wanted me to go.

25:47.696 --> 25:48.971
Why would...

25:49.008 --> 25:51.053
No, but if it's that important to you,
then,

25:51.096 --> 25:53.550
- I mean, I don't know, I'll go.
- Whatever.

25:53.587 --> 25:56.471
Look, it's just that a bunch of my friends
are gonna be there

25:56.508 --> 25:57.493
and...

25:57.536 --> 25:59.220
it's kinda like important to them.

26:00.487 --> 26:02.920
I'll ???. It's okay.

26:05.085 --> 26:06.423
Thank you.

26:08.746 --> 26:10.063
Thank you.

26:15.026 --> 26:17.371
I need you to listen to me, alright?

26:17.457 --> 26:19.000
Listen to me and trust me.

26:19.037 --> 26:20.581
Why should I trust you, Tina?

26:20.655 --> 26:22.661
Because I'm as stunned as you are.
Alright?

26:22.705 --> 26:25.293
I feel like a fucking idiot.
Just this morning, I defended Adele.

26:25.326 --> 26:27.033
I have to get off this set.

26:27.075 --> 26:28.972
- I gotta get out of here.
- Stay here. Listen.

26:29.017 --> 26:32.023
- I need you to listen to me. Do not...
- Tina, I have to get out of here.

26:32.055 --> 26:34.690
Listen, listen to me right now, okay?

26:34.725 --> 26:38.270
Do not do anything stupid.
Do not retaliate, okay?

26:38.308 --> 26:40.003
Do not get in the way of production.

26:40.037 --> 26:42.230
Talk to your agents. Let them help you.

26:42.268 --> 26:44.841
And later
you can call Niki if you'd like to.

26:47.045 --> 26:48.983
She's dead to me.

26:52.096 --> 26:54.573
I'm sorry.
I know how much that must hurt.

26:54.608 --> 26:56.490
I understand.

26:56.496 --> 26:58.110
Do you understand?

27:00.196 --> 27:03.601
Okay, fine, Jenny, maybe
I could not understand that, alright?

27:03.648 --> 27:07.770
It's just...
I need you to give me some time

27:07.806 --> 27:11.361
to figure out how to fix this, okay?

27:11.406 --> 27:12.603
There's no way

27:12.655 --> 27:15.163
I'm going to let that bitch
walk away with our movie.

27:17.006 --> 27:18.601
It is our movie.

27:23.265 --> 27:25.010
It's our movie.

27:25.045 --> 27:26.973
It is our movie.

27:27.007 --> 27:28.503
Oh, Tina.

27:32.028 --> 27:33.403
Don't be afraid.

27:36.047 --> 27:37.943
I'm sorry. Fuck!

27:37.975 --> 27:41.452
It's okay. Let just keep rolling.
Back to ???

27:43.075 --> 27:44.191
And action.

27:45.207 --> 27:46.600
Come on.

27:46.617 --> 27:48.580
Don't be afraid.

27:49.446 --> 27:51.592
I'm so afraid.

27:55.078 --> 27:56.623
I'm sorry.

28:02.037 --> 28:04.830
I want you to try it again.
Karina,

28:05.268 --> 28:07.121
jog Jessie toward you.

28:11.067 --> 28:12.372
That's good.

28:14.015 --> 28:16.623
Jessie, tilt your head up.

28:19.257 --> 28:21.091
close your eyes,

28:22.516 --> 28:24.560
like it's happening to you,

28:26.016 --> 28:27.600
like

28:27.648 --> 28:29.840
you're not in control of your own body.

28:30.847 --> 28:32.402
It's good.

28:34.087 --> 28:36.041
Let your lips apart.

28:39.528 --> 28:41.103
Karina,

28:41.906 --> 28:43.801
kiss Jessie.

28:55.046 --> 28:56.561
That's nice.

29:15.505 --> 29:18.080
Excellent. Very nice. Cut.

29:18.126 --> 29:20.080
Okay. Let's ??? everyone.

29:22.248 --> 29:23.862
Let's try to reset.

29:26.138 --> 29:28.680
Okay everyone.
We're going to do it once more

29:28.718 --> 29:30.531
and then we'll turn around on Jessie.

29:30.566 --> 29:32.363
Sam, can I get a little pushing this time

29:32.408 --> 29:34.383
as Karina's lips touch Jessie's?

29:34.426 --> 29:36.950
- Thanks.
- So let's reset, everyone.

29:36.997 --> 29:39.461
Hey Niki. It was really beautiful.
Thank you.

29:39.506 --> 29:41.351
<i>This is Bette Porter.
You've reached my cellphone.</i>

29:41.388 --> 29:42.513
<i>Leave a message.</i>

29:45.098 --> 29:48.761
Where are you?
I really need to talk to you.

29:48.795 --> 29:50.940
You won't believe
what's happening here.

29:50.945 --> 29:52.761
It's fucking crazy.

29:53.346 --> 29:56.572
Just... can you call me back?
Call me back when you can, okay?

29:57.327 --> 29:59.883
All right, I'm going to try you
at the home phone.

29:59.915 --> 30:03.560
This is "The Look" with
Sandra Husy and Mary Lamm.

30:03.605 --> 30:06.670
and back with us again today,
our special guest host,

30:06.706 --> 30:09.410
- Alice Pieszecki.
- Thank you, thank you.

30:10.028 --> 30:12.982
And today we have fashion designer,
Clea Mason,

30:13.006 --> 30:15.632
who won the price for
Best New Designer

30:15.678 --> 30:17.531
at last year Junior Fashion Show.

30:17.556 --> 30:20.111
That's right. And she's here today
to present her

30:20.146 --> 30:24.011
super hot, super androgynous
menswear-influenced fall collection.

30:24.056 --> 30:26.041
Just your style, huh, Alice?

30:26.087 --> 30:29.243
Well, actually, Mary, I don't know
if you've noticed, but I'm actually

30:29.276 --> 30:31.102
pretty much a femme. Yeah.

30:31.146 --> 30:33.072
- Femme?
- Oh, yeah. Totally girlie girl.

30:33.115 --> 30:34.901
Dresses, girlish pumps.

30:37.535 --> 30:38.861
Thank you.

30:38.886 --> 30:42.811
But bring on those boyish babes
in their hot butch fall fashion, huh? Woo!

30:42.856 --> 30:44.062
Spare us, Alice.

30:44.895 --> 30:48.161
Oh, come on, Mary, you know you want
to try it. All you straight girls do.

30:50.377 --> 30:52.231
Well... I don't.

30:52.576 --> 30:54.580
Tsk, tsk. Don't protest too much.

30:56.515 --> 30:58.951
I don't know what you're insinuating,

30:58.985 --> 31:01.820
but I'll have you know not everyone is gay.

31:02.098 --> 31:04.071
And thank God for that.

31:04.105 --> 31:07.482
Well, we'll be right back after this.

32:36.438 --> 32:38.492
- "Slightly Elevated" by
Beef Wellington (Fila Brazilia Mix) -

33:04.825 --> 33:07.352
And Clea Mason, everyone!

33:13.516 --> 33:15.293
Well, welcome to the show.

33:15.336 --> 33:16.900
- Thank you.
- Come joining us.

33:16.937 --> 33:18.351
- Ladies.
- Hi.

33:18.387 --> 33:20.181
- I love you.
- Thank you.

33:20.217 --> 33:21.732
Nice to meet you.

33:21.775 --> 33:23.412
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.

33:23.945 --> 33:26.630
So, Clea,

33:27.276 --> 33:28.681
what

33:28.717 --> 33:30.740
inspires you

33:30.788 --> 33:32.241
to dress women?

33:36.677 --> 33:38.660
I don't know... it's, um...

33:39.598 --> 33:41.193
it's, um...

33:42.106 --> 33:46.363
I bet it's the same reason
that I like to undress them.

33:50.718 --> 33:52.240
That sounds about right.

33:55.296 --> 33:58.610
So, let's, let's talk underwear.

33:58.986 --> 34:01.911
What do you like women
to wear under your clothes?

34:01.916 --> 34:03.642
Well, um...

34:03.675 --> 34:06.791
I like boxers or ??? because

34:06.837 --> 34:10.101
it kinda makes you feel
like a 14 year-old boy.

34:10.138 --> 34:12.103
Which is liberating for women.

34:12.148 --> 34:13.101
Oh yeah?

34:13.135 --> 34:14.440
And totally hot.

34:14.985 --> 34:16.442
Exactly.

34:18.014 --> 34:21.101
It's also sexy, I think, to wear

34:21.137 --> 34:23.692
like lingerie under men's clothes.

34:25.467 --> 34:27.772
Totally, totally hot.

34:29.996 --> 34:31.922
And we'll be right back

34:31.966 --> 34:33.513
after this.

34:34.857 --> 34:36.161
Why did she get fired?

34:36.197 --> 34:39.380
I can't tell you. But
all I can tell you is that it's really bad.

34:40.085 --> 34:42.710
- I'm worried about her, Tina.
- Me too.

34:43.366 --> 34:45.512
I think you should go and be with her.

34:46.034 --> 34:47.672
I just have to figure it out.

34:47.716 --> 34:50.051
I feel bad.
I don't wanna leave in a urge, but...

34:50.085 --> 34:52.612
You know what? I was just looking
at this and I think

34:52.655 --> 34:54.422
Begonia's fine with Juliana.
I'm just, you know,

34:54.465 --> 34:57.713
- I'm just worried about Niki.
- Oh fuck Niki, Tina. Come on!

34:57.755 --> 35:00.262
You know, she had no choice, okay?
She couldn't walk out with Jenny

35:00.308 --> 35:02.732
otherwise she would have been
under breach of contract, alright?

35:02.775 --> 35:04.292
- She did the right thing.
- No, she didn't.

35:27.757 --> 35:29.533
<i>This is Bette Porter.
You've reached my cellphone.</i>

35:29.575 --> 35:30.753
<i>Leave a message.</i>

35:35.095 --> 35:36.221
Bette,

35:36.835 --> 35:38.552
I'm in trouble.

35:38.588 --> 35:41.202
I'm gonna do something bad.

35:56.537 --> 35:59.172
I've rescheduled
the texto department staff meeting,

35:59.217 --> 36:00.763
but they really need some time with you.

36:00.807 --> 36:02.953
Did you tell them
it was a family emergency?

36:02.986 --> 36:04.400
Yeah, of course. They understood.

36:04.448 --> 36:05.600
Dean Porter?

36:06.037 --> 36:07.201
Oh, Freddy.

36:07.278 --> 36:09.303
- I'm so sorry I missed your presentation.
- It's okay.

36:09.327 --> 36:10.752
Just make sure you come see
the other, okay?

36:10.756 --> 36:12.190
- Absolutely.
- The press will be there.

36:15.277 --> 36:18.082
The Thesis Review Board
is fine to wait until monday.

36:18.116 --> 36:20.071
Phyllis had to go to Sacramento,

36:20.105 --> 36:22.112
so we had to postpone that meeting anyway.

36:22.217 --> 36:23.432
- Oh, good.
- Although there's something else

36:23.476 --> 36:26.360
I thought you might wanna hear about.
We got a call from W Magazine.

36:26.918 --> 36:28.233
I love W.

36:28.275 --> 36:29.503
I know it's your favorite magazine.

36:29.548 --> 36:31.471
That's why I thought
you wanna hear about this right away.

36:31.508 --> 36:33.490
They wanna do a story
on the two of you.

36:33.535 --> 36:35.232
- On Bette and me?
- Yeah.

36:35.278 --> 36:37.312
After the Ellen DeGeneres cover
was such a hot item,

36:37.355 --> 36:38.910
they want to do something on,

36:38.945 --> 36:41.893
like, power lesbian couples?
They want you to be the,

36:41.937 --> 36:43.983
the art power couple.

36:44.856 --> 36:47.580
So they want to photograph
you guys at the,

36:47.617 --> 36:49.840
at Jodi's Hammer Museum opening.

36:49.886 --> 36:52.571
But it's coming fast. So we need
to let them know. What should I tell them?

36:52.997 --> 36:54.950
- Yes.
- No.

37:02.025 --> 37:04.052
Sorry I've kept you waiting.

37:07.647 --> 37:10.521
Goodbye and good days,
see you tomorrow,

37:10.555 --> 37:12.951
oh, and don't forget to log on
our website after the show

37:12.985 --> 37:14.632
to let us know whether you want

37:14.668 --> 37:17.950
Alice to become a permanent ???
on "The Look".

37:17.987 --> 37:19.312
Of course they do.

37:19.747 --> 37:21.211
- See you later.
- Bye bye.

37:25.147 --> 37:28.131
Wow? How was it? Do your cheeks hurt
from all of the smiling you have to do.

37:28.177 --> 37:30.391
- Oh, Alice.
- Can I get water?

37:32.266 --> 37:34.402
Okay, I'll see you. Okay.

37:34.446 --> 37:38.130
I'm Alice. How are you?
Hi. Thanks for coming.

37:38.168 --> 37:40.133
Please vote for me.
Tell your friends.

37:40.167 --> 37:41.740
Don't you want me?

37:45.325 --> 37:47.573
Would you excuse me?
I'm sorry. Thanks.

37:49.488 --> 37:51.101
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

37:52.077 --> 37:55.223
I just wanted to invite you
to a party next week

37:55.316 --> 37:58.273
on the Venice boardwalk.
It's fashion week and

37:58.307 --> 38:01.002
we're having this outdoor fashion show.

38:01.035 --> 38:03.341
"Outdoor fashion show", right there.

38:03.387 --> 38:05.962
- I would love to come. Thank you.
- Oh, good.

38:05.996 --> 38:08.423
I wanna get one of those little scooters.

38:08.466 --> 38:11.103
Well, I could take you for a ride on mine.

38:19.056 --> 38:21.542
I think you have a fan.

38:22.237 --> 38:24.250
Tasha?! W...

38:24.797 --> 38:27.550
I want you to meet Clea Mason.

38:27.596 --> 38:29.763
- No? Okay.
- Hi.

38:34.058 --> 38:37.100
- Alright. I hope you could come.
- I'm definitively gonna be there.

38:37.138 --> 38:38.650
Thanks for the invite.

38:43.067 --> 38:45.842
- What are you doing here?
- I didn't go.

38:46.297 --> 38:47.560
'Cause of me?

38:47.605 --> 38:49.542
You looked great.

38:50.017 --> 38:52.492
I got here late, but the audience,
they really like you.

38:53.525 --> 38:55.102
I'm really glad you stayed.

39:02.076 --> 39:03.520
How was the meeting?

39:15.367 --> 39:17.550
You know we can't be part of that piece.

39:20.577 --> 39:22.522
It would be dishonest.

39:22.565 --> 39:24.443
Dishonest how?

39:24.475 --> 39:27.083
They're writing about couples
and we're not a couple.

39:29.036 --> 39:30.562
We're not?

39:30.598 --> 39:32.850
Because it's just not working.

39:39.015 --> 39:40.972
{\a6}I meant our friendship.

39:54.147 --> 39:57.543
I don't think
that therapy is the answer, Jodi.

39:57.575 --> 39:58.921
Why?

40:01.588 --> 40:04.303
I don't wanna go to therapy.

40:04.348 --> 40:07.831
- I've had enough therapy.
- But you owe it to me.

40:15.538 --> 40:19.410
Jodi, I wanted so much
for this relationship to work.

40:22.288 --> 40:24.353
I love who you are.

40:25.307 --> 40:28.453
I love how you stand in the world.

40:28.495 --> 40:32.573
I love your talent; I love your passion;
I love your anger;

40:32.615 --> 40:34.371
but you and I

40:34.416 --> 40:36.811
are just fundamentally different.

40:36.858 --> 40:39.400
We have different core values.

40:39.447 --> 40:42.021
- What are my values?
- It doesn't matter.

40:42.067 --> 40:43.522
It's not a judgment.

40:46.338 --> 40:48.272
What matter is

40:51.305 --> 40:53.652
that there's been something missing for me.

40:53.697 --> 40:55.650
Something that is

40:56.587 --> 40:58.571
hard to define.

40:59.468 --> 41:03.302
And I have been desperately
just trying to create

41:04.308 --> 41:06.850
this thing, and just looking

41:07.227 --> 41:08.722
for it. But I...

41:10.587 --> 41:12.470
I've been just flailing.

41:16.038 --> 41:18.173
And I realize now

41:19.045 --> 41:20.761
that you and I,

41:20.808 --> 41:22.661
we're never going to find it.

41:26.936 --> 41:28.340
How do you know?

41:31.066 --> 41:33.160
Because I have it with someone else.

41:38.766 --> 41:41.320
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but Melissa just called.

41:41.325 --> 41:42.731
Is everything okay?

41:42.765 --> 41:46.522
Well she has food poisoning or something
and she can't pick up Angie from her playday.

41:48.556 --> 41:50.073
Okay, thank you.

41:51.238 --> 41:53.290
- Do you have to go now?
- No.

41:53.336 --> 41:55.141
- Who are you calling?
- Tina.

42:03.126 --> 42:05.911
We didn't sign on to do
an Adele Channing movie.

42:05.946 --> 42:08.993
Look, this happens all the time
and there's business, okay?

42:09.036 --> 42:11.641
Director gave you place,
you have to roll with it.

42:11.676 --> 42:13.440
<i>You have a phone call...</i>

42:13.485 --> 42:15.500
Well, is it true
she's gonna fire Niki?

42:15.537 --> 42:16.742
No.

42:16.776 --> 42:18.110
Is it true Shane quit?

42:20.045 --> 42:21.931
Excuse me. I have to take this.

42:23.557 --> 42:25.631
Bette, I can't talk.
I'm in a meeting.

42:25.676 --> 42:29.650
Look, Melissa's sick and I'm not gonna
be able to pick Angie at the playgroup

42:29.685 --> 42:31.901
<i>- I was wandering if you could pick her up.
- No, I can't.</i>

42:31.935 --> 42:33.601
It's total chaos here.

42:33.646 --> 42:36.253
- Where are you?
- I'm at school.

42:38.095 --> 42:39.692
Jodi's here.

42:39.737 --> 42:41.991
- Still?
<i>- I'm trying my best.</i>

42:42.035 --> 42:44.851
I'll tell you about it later, okay?

42:44.856 --> 42:47.330
<i>Okay. Fine.</i>

43:21.326 --> 43:23.820
Babe, what's taking you so long?

43:23.865 --> 43:25.542
I messed up.

43:26.675 --> 43:28.010
Well, hurry up, alright?

43:28.048 --> 43:30.112
We want it for 6' for showtime.

44:11.787 --> 44:14.102
<i>You have a phone call...</i>

44:25.348 --> 44:27.571
Bette, I can't talk right now.

44:27.608 --> 44:31.372
<i>Listen, I am in such a ???
Alright? Melissa's sick.</i>

44:31.416 --> 44:34.081
And, and, I was wandering
if, you know, maybe you could

44:34.116 --> 44:37.352
pick up Angie from playgroup. I'm sorry,
I'm not gonna be able to get there in time.

44:38.568 --> 44:40.560
Alright, alright, alright, I'll be there.

45:12.085 --> 45:13.450
Do you want a ride home?

45:42.558 --> 45:43.560
Suck.

45:51.277 --> 45:53.440
Never again am I gonna

45:53.477 --> 45:56.882
avail myself to someone
with such generosity

45:56.928 --> 45:59.171
and an open heart
and show her the ropes

45:59.178 --> 46:01.400
and teach her everything I know.

46:02.567 --> 46:03.881
- "Only Women Bleed" by Alice Cooper -

46:04.698 --> 46:06.862
You can't let Adele do that to you.

46:06.906 --> 46:08.602
No, I'm talking about Niki.

46:10.025 --> 46:12.392
- Oh, fuck Niki.
- I did.

46:12.438 --> 46:14.433
She's fucking worthless.

46:15.086 --> 46:18.212
Damn all those actors.
She should be on the cover of Maxim.

46:18.257 --> 46:19.251
Hey,

46:20.058 --> 46:22.793
I'm not in love with her anymore.

46:22.835 --> 46:23.820
Good.

46:23.868 --> 46:25.732
She's dead to me.

46:25.767 --> 46:28.370
- Niki's dead?
- She doesn't exist anymore.

46:28.407 --> 46:29.752
Ding, dong, Niki's dead?

46:32.068 --> 46:33.862
It's like a wicked witch.

46:33.876 --> 46:35.562
- Yeah, that's right.
- No.

46:35.607 --> 46:38.943
Like a wicked...
that, like, wicked witch! Okay.

46:38.948 --> 46:40.981
She pretends to be like

46:41.047 --> 46:44.371
all sweet and all innocent, right?

46:45.067 --> 46:46.482
And like she's like,

46:46.525 --> 46:48.830
"I think you're like
the greatest writer ever,

46:48.866 --> 46:50.013
and,

46:50.058 --> 46:52.583
like I wanna be just like you"...

46:52.625 --> 46:55.682
- And, you know...
- Well, she's an actor. That's what they do.

46:55.717 --> 46:57.681
- No, Adele.
- Who?

46:57.717 --> 46:58.921
Adele!

46:59.596 --> 47:02.160
Adele? Oh God, Adele...

47:03.048 --> 47:05.260
Jenny, Adele is...

47:07.008 --> 47:10.332
- What?
- She's a snake.

47:12.906 --> 47:15.253
A snake in the grass. She's...

47:17.028 --> 47:18.661
She's a fucking serpent.

47:20.585 --> 47:22.772
I have terrible cramps.

47:23.595 --> 47:24.661
You do?

47:25.018 --> 47:27.681
Can I have another hit off the bong?

47:29.866 --> 47:31.403
I was

47:31.447 --> 47:33.792
about to give you a compliment though.

47:34.195 --> 47:35.370
What?

47:37.206 --> 47:39.930
- I admire you.
- You do?

47:39.975 --> 47:41.382
I think you're...

47:43.276 --> 47:44.923
a real survivor.

47:45.815 --> 47:47.440
Ever since you got here.

47:47.487 --> 47:49.062
Yeah, you got that.

47:51.066 --> 47:52.333
And then you're all...

47:56.675 --> 47:58.880
Oh but seriously, like you're really...

47:59.557 --> 48:01.503
You got knocked down a few times, but

48:02.105 --> 48:03.770
look at you, you got back up and

48:04.366 --> 48:06.231
- you wrote your story.
- Yeah.

48:06.276 --> 48:07.550
You put it up there.

48:09.065 --> 48:10.392
That's big.

48:11.656 --> 48:13.141
I haven't done that.

48:15.777 --> 48:18.473
I'm going to throw the compliment
right back at you.

48:18.505 --> 48:19.533
Oh yeah?

48:19.906 --> 48:22.593
- What's that?
- You didn't have to come with me today.

48:22.636 --> 48:25.153
It's solidarity. Look at that.

48:30.087 --> 48:31.800
You gave me my job.

48:36.346 --> 48:37.612
You're my best friend.

48:39.186 --> 48:40.262
You know that.

48:40.816 --> 48:42.652
So, of course I would do that.

48:43.395 --> 48:44.773
It's the truth.

49:00.545 --> 49:02.192
Do you need a ride?

49:02.235 --> 49:04.253
Tom is coming picking me up.

49:07.875 --> 49:09.681
I wanna call you about

49:09.727 --> 49:11.682
about my Hammer speech
I want you to read.

49:17.286 --> 49:20.110
This was gonna be your birthday present.

49:27.537 --> 49:28.492
Whatever.

- "You Were Wrong" by Castle Project -

50:37.687 --> 50:39.093
Hey you, guys.

50:41.007 --> 50:42.150

50:42.768 --> 50:44.792
- the oracle.
- Max,

50:44.837 --> 50:47.272
you're the shit. I gotta listen to

50:48.306 --> 50:49.420
you.

50:49.465 --> 50:51.082
You guys are so stoned.

50:52.037 --> 50:54.161
Max, Adele

50:54.206 --> 50:56.173
has fucked me over.

50:57.316 --> 50:58.351
- Really?
- Yeah.

50:58.386 --> 51:00.013
- I'm sorry.
- Have a seat.

51:00.047 --> 51:02.482
- Welcome to my house.	
- What happened?

51:02.527 --> 51:03.742
Would you like some

51:03.788 --> 51:04.983
cannabis?

51:05.767 --> 51:07.933
- Yeah.
- I should have listened to you.

51:10.378 --> 51:12.273
I should have listened to you.

by Veda Brown -

51:23.667 --> 51:26.843
Oh yes. Hang on, baby girl.
I'll be right there.

Brown rice pudding and organic

Your mama would...

51:42.095 --> 51:43.910
Hi, Angelica.

51:48.807 --> 51:51.683
Guess what I've got for you.

51:51.716 --> 51:54.233
Cookie and... Hi, pretty.

51:54.276 --> 51:58.683
Let me have your toy.
Let share. Okay?

51:59.396 --> 52:00.941
Let share.

52:10.087 --> 52:11.372
Oh God!

52:28.198 --> 52:29.543
Can I have it?

52:52.067 --> 52:54.202
Guess who's here?!

52:54.277 --> 52:58.000
- Look!
- Hey, hi baby girl.

52:59.066 --> 53:01.563
Who's that? Mama T.

53:02.056 --> 53:03.973
Yeah. Oh!

53:04.007 --> 53:06.120
- And mama B.
- Mama B. is here.

53:06.155 --> 53:09.520
- She's here, honey.
- Hi you, pumpkin pie.

53:10.087 --> 53:11.231
I missed you.

53:12.078 --> 53:14.080
You would not believe the day I had.

53:14.115 --> 53:15.882
I bet I could give you a run for your money.

53:15.915 --> 53:18.881
And I could give you both
a run for your money.

53:18.917 --> 53:22.782
I promise you that
Dawn Denbo and her lover Cindi

53:22.828 --> 53:24.692
are not going to get their hands
on The Planet.

53:24.725 --> 53:27.510
You know, that's not important.

53:27.556 --> 53:31.763
You know, what's important is
this beautiful baby girl

53:31.795 --> 53:34.582
and her wonderful

53:34.618 --> 53:35.902
mommies.

53:37.078 --> 53:38.400
You're sweet.

53:38.438 --> 53:40.061
You say thank you to aunt Kitty?

53:42.378 --> 53:43.671
You wanna go home?

53:48.828 --> 53:51.950
Let's ask mama T.
if she wanna go home, maybe.

53:51.995 --> 53:53.481
Go home!

53:55.985 --> 53:56.970
Do you wanna...?

53:59.908 --> 54:01.102
Yeah.

54:02.958 --> 54:05.580
- Thank you. Thank you.
- It's okay.
