WEBVTT

00:04.560 --> 00:06.596
If wedding invitations
were left up to men...

00:06.760 --> 00:09.433
...we'd just drive around
sticking fliers in windshields.

00:10.840 --> 00:11.989
Not even typed up either.

00:12.160 --> 00:14.674
Just magic markers,
xeroxed, you know;

00:14.840 --> 00:16.558
"Party."

00:18.840 --> 00:21.035
What's needed
is a divorce announcement.

00:21.200 --> 00:23.919
"Mr. and Mrs. Fred Johnson
request the honour of your presence...

00:24.080 --> 00:29.632
...at the returning of their daughter
back to Mr. and Mrs. Fred Johnson."

00:36.000 --> 00:37.752
-Hi.
-Hi, can I help you?

00:37.920 --> 00:41.435
-Yes, we'd like wedding invitations.
-Oh, well, congratulations.

00:41.600 --> 00:42.874
-Thank you.
-Yeah, thank you.

00:43.040 --> 00:44.234
-When's the wedding?
-June.

00:44.400 --> 00:49.030
-Late June.
-We have quite a few to pick from.

00:49.200 --> 00:52.556
They're arranged in order of price.
The most expensive are in the front.

00:58.720 --> 01:00.312
I don't know, what about this one?

01:01.240 --> 01:04.789
To tell you the truth, they haven't
made those for a number of years.

01:04.959 --> 01:07.315
I might have some boxes
in our warehouse in New Jersey.

01:07.480 --> 01:10.119
-I'd have to check.
-Oh, no. George, that's so ugly.

01:10.280 --> 01:11.633
We don't want that.

01:11.800 --> 01:14.872
What's the difference?
You just read it and mail it right back.

01:15.040 --> 01:17.235
-These ones.
-Why don't they make them anymore?

01:17.400 --> 01:21.188
Well, for one thing,
the glue isn't very adhesive.

01:21.360 --> 01:23.510
It takes a lot of moisture
to make them stick.

01:23.800 --> 01:26.075
So we pick up some Elmer's.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.513
All right.

01:30.720 --> 01:32.597
Do you see what I do for you?

01:34.480 --> 01:36.118
-Hey, Kramer.
-Hey, George.

01:36.840 --> 01:39.354
-Lilly.
-No, Susan.

01:39.520 --> 01:42.557
-No, no, it's Lilly.
-I think I know my own name.

01:42.720 --> 01:43.948
It's Susan.

01:44.760 --> 01:47.797
Well, you look like a Lilly.

01:51.680 --> 01:53.193
It's coming, Jerry, it's coming.

01:53.360 --> 01:55.999
-What's coming?
-The day.

01:56.160 --> 01:57.991
The day.

01:58.160 --> 02:00.799
We ordered
the wedding invitations today.

02:00.960 --> 02:03.599
Nothing can stop it now, nothing.

02:04.040 --> 02:06.395
It's here. It's happening.

02:06.560 --> 02:09.791
Can I do this? I can't do this.
Look at me. Look at me, I can't do this.

02:09.960 --> 02:11.916
I can't do it.
Help me, Jerry, help me.

02:12.080 --> 02:14.514
Just break it off with her.
Tell her it's over.

02:15.200 --> 02:16.474
I can't.

02:16.640 --> 02:18.392
-Why not?
-Because I can't face that scene.

02:18.560 --> 02:20.471
You know what kind of a scene
that would be?

02:20.640 --> 02:23.598
I'd rather be unhappy for the rest
of my life than to go through that.

02:23.760 --> 02:27.514
I can't. I've tried to psych myself up
a million times. I can't go through that.

02:27.680 --> 02:29.591
All right, take it easy.
Just take it easy.

02:31.760 --> 02:34.035
-What about a letter?
-A letter?

02:34.200 --> 02:36.156
I write a letter
and then I go to China.

02:37.600 --> 02:41.115
I disappear in a sea of people
for, like, six months, a year.

02:41.280 --> 02:43.953
You know,
just while things simmer down.

02:44.440 --> 02:47.512
"Dear Susan, I'm sorry.

02:47.760 --> 02:49.671
I made a terrible mistake.

02:49.840 --> 02:53.116
I'm really, really sorry."

02:54.080 --> 02:56.958
-That's it?
-What, too short?

02:57.120 --> 02:59.236
-Seems a little short, yeah.
-A little short.

02:59.520 --> 03:01.590
You can't go to China.
What about your job?

03:01.760 --> 03:04.115
Right. My job.

03:04.280 --> 03:06.589
So write a letter
and move to Staten lsland.

03:06.760 --> 03:09.752
It's easier to blend into a sea of people
in Staten lsland than China.

03:10.600 --> 03:13.273
Yeah, yeah. Staten lsland.

03:13.680 --> 03:16.956
-How do I get the rest of my clothes?
-You come back for your clothes.

03:17.120 --> 03:19.998
-I'm not going back in there.
-So forget about your clothes.

03:20.480 --> 03:23.756
Well, I'm not starting up
a whole new wardrobe now!

03:24.920 --> 03:28.071
Freedom and no clothes is a lot better
than no freedom with clothes.

03:28.560 --> 03:30.551
If she would just
take a plane somewhere.

03:30.720 --> 03:31.994
And what, hope for a crash?

03:33.120 --> 03:34.235
It happens.

03:34.400 --> 03:36.755
Do you know the odds on a crash?
It's a million to one.

03:37.280 --> 03:41.034
It's something. It's hope.

03:42.400 --> 03:43.719
-Hey. Hey!
-Hey.

03:43.880 --> 03:45.757
Georgie, you know
what I just realized?

03:46.080 --> 03:49.197
The wedding is like a month away.

03:49.760 --> 03:51.193
-Elaine.
-What?

03:51.360 --> 03:54.318
Oh, by the way, what am I gonna
get to be in the wedding party?

03:55.040 --> 03:57.110
-What do you mean?
-Jerry's gonna be best man...

03:57.280 --> 03:59.350
...and Kramer's the usher.
What am I gonna be?

03:59.600 --> 04:01.113
I don't think you're anything.

04:01.440 --> 04:05.592
Well, I have to be something.
I'm a close friend.

04:05.960 --> 04:08.793
-What about being a bridesmaid?
-Well, those are Susan's friends.

04:10.200 --> 04:14.398
-Then how about being an usher?
-All right, I'll ask Susan about it later.

04:14.560 --> 04:17.916
You don't ask. You tell.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.991
What about the letter?
Should I think about it?

04:23.160 --> 04:25.390
Elaine, if a guy wanted
to end a relationship...

04:25.560 --> 04:26.629
...what could he do?

04:27.920 --> 04:29.592
Start smoking.

04:30.200 --> 04:31.952
Smoking.

04:32.120 --> 04:34.395
-Does she hate cigarettes?
-Yes, she hates cigarettes.

04:34.960 --> 04:36.632
But you don't smoke.

04:37.240 --> 04:39.117
No.

04:41.120 --> 04:43.839
You know, I think I'm getting
depressed about George's wedding.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.560
-Really?
-Yeah, once he gets married, that's it.

04:46.720 --> 04:49.188
She'll probably get pregnant.
They'll move to Westchester.

04:49.360 --> 04:52.158
-I'll never see him again.
-Yeah, you're probably right.

04:52.320 --> 04:54.993
-Then it'll be just me, you and Kramer.
-No, not me, pal.

04:55.160 --> 04:57.628
I can't keep this up much longer.
I'm sick of being single.

04:57.800 --> 05:00.268
-I'm getting out.
-So it's just gonna be me and Kramer?

05:00.440 --> 05:02.556
Yeah, just you and Kramer.

05:02.720 --> 05:04.119
See you.

05:05.040 --> 05:06.951
Me and Kramer.

05:08.080 --> 05:10.355
Hey, buddy.

05:10.760 --> 05:13.991
Hey, I thought of
a great invention for driving.

05:14.160 --> 05:17.118
A periscope in a car,
so you can see traffic.

05:17.280 --> 05:18.554
How are you gonna drive...

05:18.720 --> 05:21.029
...while you're
looking through a periscope?

05:21.200 --> 05:22.838
Besides which, it's not a submarine.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.956
There's no room for a periscope
on a car.

05:25.120 --> 05:27.839
-Oh, you make a higher roof.
-They're not making higher roofs.

05:28.120 --> 05:29.758
Well, why can't you
make a higher roof?

05:30.480 --> 05:32.311
Because it's a stupid idea.

05:32.480 --> 05:35.631
No one's gonna go for it.
Don't you understand? It's stupid!

05:37.440 --> 05:38.998
Stupid. It's stupid.

05:40.480 --> 05:41.833
Hey, hey, hey, look out!

05:42.880 --> 05:44.916
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

05:45.080 --> 05:47.674
Yeah, thanks.

05:47.840 --> 05:49.717
Oh, my God. You saved my life.

05:49.880 --> 05:52.599
Shouldn't there be
some kind of reward for that?

05:53.640 --> 05:55.392
You should be careful
crossing the street.

05:55.560 --> 05:57.676
Otherwise you could die,
if that bothers you.

05:58.480 --> 06:01.597
-Well, yeah--
-See? To me, this is a waste.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.831
-What?
-The shirt under your sweater.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.752
It sits in a drawer for three weeks...

06:05.920 --> 06:09.071
...and when it finally comes out,
it only sticks up out of your collar.

06:09.440 --> 06:11.431
-I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
-Jeannie Steinman.

06:11.840 --> 06:15.355
-Same initials. How do you like that?
-I like it.

06:16.480 --> 06:19.790
Listen, I was talking to Elaine today,
and she said...

06:19.960 --> 06:22.520
...that she would really like
to be an usher at the wedding.

06:23.360 --> 06:25.191
No, out of the question.

06:25.360 --> 06:27.351
I don't want any women ushers
at my wedding.

06:27.520 --> 06:30.751
And while we're on the subject,
Kramer's not an usher either.

06:30.920 --> 06:33.388
-Why not?
-He doesn't even know my name.

06:33.880 --> 06:36.394
-That was an honest mistake.
-No, he's too weird.

06:36.560 --> 06:38.994
He'd fall or something.
He'd ruin the whole ceremony.

06:40.480 --> 06:42.550
Yeah, you're probably right.

06:45.960 --> 06:47.632
What are you doing?

06:50.200 --> 06:51.679
Since when do you smoke?

06:53.280 --> 06:55.191
I've always smoked.

06:55.880 --> 07:00.032
-I've never seen you smoke.
-Oh, yeah, well, big smoker.

07:00.320 --> 07:02.993
I gave it up for a while,
but it was too tough.

07:03.160 --> 07:06.675
You know, I don't got the willpower.

07:06.920 --> 07:11.391
-Oh, I don't like this one bit.
-Well, I can't stop now.

07:13.880 --> 07:16.599
I'm addicted.
They've gotten a hold on me.

07:17.120 --> 07:18.872
Well, you are gonna have to quit.

07:24.840 --> 07:26.398
-Menus?
-No, I know what I want.

07:26.560 --> 07:27.788
-The usual?
-Yeah.

07:27.960 --> 07:30.394
-And for you?
-A bowl of Cheerios, not too much milk.

07:30.560 --> 07:32.152
Okay, two bowls of Cheerios.

07:35.520 --> 07:36.873
-You too?
-Yeah.

07:39.240 --> 07:41.913
Hey, did you hear
the bank on the corner...

07:42.080 --> 07:45.755
...is offering $100 if you go in there
and they don't greet you with a "hello."

07:46.240 --> 07:47.639
Oh, really? That's nice.

07:48.840 --> 07:51.308
-Come on. What's with you?
-I think I'm in love.

07:52.360 --> 07:54.237
Oh, come on.

07:54.520 --> 07:56.875
No, it's true.
This woman saved my life.

07:57.040 --> 07:59.270
I was crossing the street.
I was almost hit by a car.

07:59.440 --> 08:00.634
And then we talked...

08:00.800 --> 08:03.155
...and the whole thing
just seemed like a dream.

08:03.320 --> 08:06.551
If a guy saved your life,
you'd be in love with him too.

08:07.440 --> 08:09.431
No, this woman is different.
She's incredible.

08:09.920 --> 08:12.832
She's just like me.
She talks like me. She acts like me.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.549
She ordered cereal in a restaurant.
We even have the same initials.

08:17.760 --> 08:20.069
-Wait, I just realized what's going on.
-What?

08:20.240 --> 08:22.913
Now I know what I've been
looking for all these years.

08:23.080 --> 08:24.672
Myself.

08:27.160 --> 08:30.311
I've been waiting
for me to come along.

08:30.480 --> 08:33.438
And now I've swept myself
off my feet.

08:35.280 --> 08:38.556
Will you stop it, man?
You're freaking me out.

08:38.720 --> 08:40.438
Jeez.

08:45.200 --> 08:46.394
-Hey.
-Hey.

08:46.720 --> 08:49.712
-Wait a second, you didn't say "hello."
-Yes, I did.

08:49.880 --> 08:52.155
No. No, you didn't.
Hundred dollars. I get $100.

08:52.320 --> 08:54.675
-No, no, I said "hello."
-No, no, you said "hey."

08:54.840 --> 08:56.990
Well, "hey" is "hello." Same thing.

08:57.160 --> 09:00.232
The ad said the bank will pay $100
if you're not greeted with a "hello."

09:00.400 --> 09:02.550
You're taking that much too literally.

09:02.720 --> 09:04.676
Now, sir, do you have
any business to transact?

09:04.840 --> 09:07.149
-I wanna speak with the manager.
-He's not here.

09:07.640 --> 09:09.278
Then I'll be back.

09:10.240 --> 09:12.151
-So I'm not gonna be an usher?
-No.

09:12.480 --> 09:13.913
So I'm nothing?

09:14.080 --> 09:18.039
Jerry is best man,
Kramer is an usher, and I am nothing?

09:18.360 --> 09:20.954
-Kramer's not an usher anymore.
-What are you talking about?

09:21.120 --> 09:22.872
-You've been demoted.
-Why?

09:23.040 --> 09:25.031
Because you called her
by the wrong name.

09:25.760 --> 09:28.069
But she really looks like a Lilly.

09:28.960 --> 09:32.635
Jerry. Hey, Jerry, Susan says
I can't be an usher at the wedding.

09:32.800 --> 09:34.233
Yeah, me neither.

09:34.400 --> 09:36.550
George, I wanna bring a date
to the wedding.

09:36.720 --> 09:38.790
-Who?
-I just met her. She's incredible.

09:38.960 --> 09:41.758
Oh, this is great!

09:41.920 --> 09:46.038
Now I'm gonna be stuck
at the singles' table with all the losers?

09:47.280 --> 09:49.794
-You can go with Kramer.
-No, no, no.

09:49.960 --> 09:52.394
Weddings are a great place
to meet chicks.

09:52.560 --> 09:54.869
I have to be unfettered.

09:55.840 --> 09:57.796
Do you see
what this is turning into?

09:57.960 --> 10:00.758
Do I need this?
I have got to get out of this thing.

10:00.920 --> 10:03.957
-Did you try the cigarettes?
-Yeah, they made me sick.

10:04.120 --> 10:07.192
All right, all right.
Let's get down here.

10:08.840 --> 10:10.558
You really wanna get out
of this thing?

10:11.560 --> 10:14.552
-Yeah.
-All right. I got two words for you;

10:14.720 --> 10:16.631
Prenup.

10:17.240 --> 10:18.559
Prenup, what does that mean?

10:18.720 --> 10:22.998
-Ask her to sign a prenup.
-What does that do?

10:23.160 --> 10:25.276
Because most women,
when asked to sign a prenup...

10:25.440 --> 10:27.954
...are so offended,
they back out of the marriage.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.558
They are?

10:31.160 --> 10:33.879
-Elaine?
-I wouldn't sign one.

10:36.120 --> 10:39.351
Prenup, of course.

10:40.320 --> 10:43.039
-Kramer.
-Get out of here.

10:47.680 --> 10:48.999
-Hi.
-Hi.

10:49.160 --> 10:51.799
Hey, I've been going over the list.
Wanna invite The Drake?

10:51.960 --> 10:54.349
Oh, got to invite The Drake.

10:54.520 --> 10:55.953
Listen.

10:56.360 --> 10:58.191
There's something
that's been on my mind...

10:58.360 --> 11:02.148
...and we haven't really talked about it
and it's kind of important to me.

11:02.640 --> 11:03.834
What is it?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.673
Well, I've put a lot of thought
into this...

11:06.840 --> 11:10.515
...and I think that I would like you
to sign a prenuptial agreement.

11:11.560 --> 11:13.835
-A prenup?
-Yeah.

11:18.120 --> 11:19.917
What's so funny?

11:20.800 --> 11:23.997
You don't have any money.
I make more money than you do.

11:27.960 --> 11:30.918
Yeah, give me the papers,
I'll sign them.

11:32.920 --> 11:34.273
A prenup.

11:59.160 --> 12:00.957
Excuse me.

12:05.160 --> 12:06.798
Jerry.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.672
-Hey, Jeannie.
-Hello.

12:09.840 --> 12:11.796
-Remember I told you about the bank?
-Yeah.

12:11.960 --> 12:15.032
Well, I went in there
and they said, "hey."

12:15.800 --> 12:17.552
"Hey" is the same as "hello."
What do you think?

12:17.720 --> 12:19.551
Yeah, I think it's the same thing.

12:20.120 --> 12:22.680
Oh, big surprise.

12:29.080 --> 12:32.152
-Delivery from Melody Stationers.
-Oh, those are the invitations.

12:32.320 --> 12:34.197
-Just sign here.
-Yeah.

12:35.280 --> 12:36.713
Thank you.

12:37.040 --> 12:38.917
-See you later.
-Oh, these are so cheap.

12:39.080 --> 12:41.196
Don't forget tomorrow.
We're shopping for rings...

12:41.360 --> 12:45.069
...so don't make any plans.
And this time we're not skimping.

12:46.400 --> 12:47.879
-Hey.
-Hey.

12:48.040 --> 12:49.917
-Jeannie left?
-Yeah, she's coming to see...

12:50.080 --> 12:52.594
-...my act tonight.
-Oh, yeah? Well, that's nice.

12:52.760 --> 12:55.354
I'm sure that's right up her alley.

12:55.520 --> 12:56.919
-What's with you?
-Nothing.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.229
-Something on your mind?
-No.

12:58.400 --> 12:59.628
-Looks like there is.
-No.

12:59.800 --> 13:02.314
Come on, something's
on your mind. Out with it.

13:02.520 --> 13:04.590
I don't like her!

13:04.880 --> 13:06.472
-You don't like her?
-That's right.

13:06.640 --> 13:09.677
I don't like her.
I never liked her from the get-go.

13:10.160 --> 13:12.628
-What's wrong with her?
-Everything she thinks, you think.

13:12.800 --> 13:15.109
Everything you think, she thinks.
No, I can't take it.

13:15.280 --> 13:18.511
I can't take it, Jerry.
It's too much. It's too much.

13:18.680 --> 13:20.796
If you can't take her,
maybe you can't take me.

13:21.080 --> 13:23.958
-So that's how it's gonna be?
-That's how it's gonna be.

13:24.120 --> 13:26.998
Oh, God help us!

13:35.000 --> 13:36.479
Awful.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.755
-Can I help you?
-Yeah.

14:23.080 --> 14:25.753
I was in here the other day,
and I went up to that teller...

14:25.920 --> 14:27.353
...and he didn't say "hello."

14:28.120 --> 14:30.953
Well, then you are entitled to $100.
That's our policy.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.111
Yeah, but he wouldn't
give me the money.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.192
Jim, can I see you for a second?

14:35.760 --> 14:39.673
-Yes, can you give me a minute?
-Yeah.

14:39.840 --> 14:42.877
He'll be right over.

14:53.800 --> 14:55.028
What is this, oak?

14:57.080 --> 15:00.231
-I think it's pine.
-Pine is good.

15:00.560 --> 15:02.551
Yeah, pine's okay.

15:06.480 --> 15:07.674
-You wanted to see me?
-Yeah.

15:07.840 --> 15:10.673
Jim, the man here
says he came in the other day...

15:10.840 --> 15:13.149
-...you didn't say "hello."
-No, that's not true.

15:13.320 --> 15:16.232
I said "hey." You know,
like a friendly greeting, "hey."

15:16.400 --> 15:19.039
-Yeah, but that's not "hello."
-That's a tough one.

15:20.680 --> 15:22.511
Let me bring
some other people in on this.

15:22.680 --> 15:26.878
Barbara, Jane, Mike,
can I see you, please?

15:29.560 --> 15:31.039
-How you doing?
-What's happening?

15:31.200 --> 15:32.679
What's up?

15:33.840 --> 15:37.150
Can you excuse us
for just one minute? Just one minute.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.479
Thanks.

15:43.840 --> 15:45.512
How's it going?

15:46.760 --> 15:48.637
Thanks. Thanks, everybody.

15:50.560 --> 15:53.313
Sir, have a seat.

15:56.520 --> 16:00.308
Well, we've discussed this.
Here's the feeling.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.199
You got a greeting. It starts with an H.
How's 20 bucks sound?

16:03.360 --> 16:04.873
-I'll take it.
-All right, sir.

16:21.640 --> 16:23.676
Will you marry me?

16:38.000 --> 16:41.072
I would like to propose a toast--
Wait a second!

16:41.240 --> 16:43.674
George! George Costanza,
come in here!

16:43.840 --> 16:45.478
-Georgie boy.
-George, big news.

16:45.640 --> 16:47.596
-I'm getting married.
-Married? What?

16:47.760 --> 16:51.469
September 21st, first day of autumn.
Leaves changing, beautiful colours.

16:51.640 --> 16:52.868
-All that crap.
-You see?

16:53.040 --> 16:55.349
-I kept up my end of the pact.
-Oh, good for you.

16:55.520 --> 16:57.351
-And look, champagne.
-Hey.

16:57.520 --> 16:59.988
-To our future wives.
-Oh, yeah.

17:00.160 --> 17:01.718
Yeah.

17:14.160 --> 17:16.878
This has been quite a night.
I could sure use a cup of coffee.

17:17.040 --> 17:19.554
Hey, what's the deal with decaf?

17:19.720 --> 17:21.472
How do they get the caffeine
out of there?

17:21.640 --> 17:24.473
-And then where does it go?
-I don't know.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.358
That's a shame.

17:30.800 --> 17:33.109
-I'll just have a cup of coffee.
-Bowl of corn flakes.

17:34.520 --> 17:36.397
More cereal?
That's your third bowl today.

17:36.560 --> 17:40.030
-You had it for breakfast and lunch.
-Hey. So, what's the deal with brunch?

17:40.200 --> 17:42.191
If it's a combination
of breakfast and lunch...

17:42.360 --> 17:45.193
...how come there's no "lupper,"
or no "linner"?

17:50.160 --> 17:51.639
Hey!

17:52.000 --> 17:54.560
Frank just called me.
Congratulations.

17:54.720 --> 17:57.917
-Thanks. Thanks.
-Look, I'm sorry about before.

17:58.080 --> 18:01.197
-I'm sure I'll learn to like her, Jerry.
-Yeah, yeah.

18:01.360 --> 18:04.033
Come on, come on.
What's the matter?

18:05.280 --> 18:07.350
I think I may have
made a big mistake.

18:08.800 --> 18:11.268
-Oh, come on.
-No, all of a sudden it hit me.

18:11.440 --> 18:12.919
I realized what the problem is.

18:13.080 --> 18:15.036
I can't be with someone like me.

18:15.200 --> 18:17.191
I hate myself!

18:17.560 --> 18:19.869
I need to be with someone
the complete opposite of me.

18:20.040 --> 18:22.952
It's too much, Kramer.
I can't take it! I can't take it!

18:24.400 --> 18:27.153
It's too bad you got engaged.

18:27.720 --> 18:29.597
Yeah, too bad.

18:31.080 --> 18:32.957
Hello? Oh, hey, George.

18:33.120 --> 18:36.032
What? Really?

18:36.200 --> 18:38.395
I'll call Elaine.
We'll meet you down there.

18:38.560 --> 18:40.790
-What happened?
-They took Susan to the hospital.

18:42.280 --> 18:44.635
-So she was just lying there?
-Yeah.

18:44.800 --> 18:46.552
-I wonder what happened.
-I don't know.

18:46.720 --> 18:48.790
There's the doctor.

18:49.880 --> 18:51.518
Excuse me, are you the husband?

18:52.200 --> 18:58.355
-Well, not yet. Fiancé.
-Yes. Well, I'm sorry.

18:58.520 --> 19:00.158
She's gone.

19:02.840 --> 19:04.319
What's that?

19:06.080 --> 19:07.354
She expired.

19:10.640 --> 19:12.392
Are you sure?

19:14.040 --> 19:15.359
Yes, of course.

19:15.920 --> 19:18.115
So...

19:18.280 --> 19:19.508
...she's dead?

19:21.920 --> 19:23.194
Yes.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.319
Let me ask you...

19:29.480 --> 19:34.918
...had she been exposed
to any kind of inexpensive glue?

19:37.560 --> 19:39.516
-Why?
-We found traces...

19:39.680 --> 19:42.319
...of a certain toxic adhesive...

19:42.480 --> 19:46.314
...commonly found
in very low-priced envelopes.

19:47.440 --> 19:50.034
Well, she was sending out
our wedding invitations.

19:50.960 --> 19:53.394
That's probably what did it.

19:54.240 --> 19:56.959
We were expecting
about 200 people.

19:59.360 --> 20:03.592
Well, thank you, doctor.

20:20.240 --> 20:22.117
She's...

20:23.040 --> 20:24.473
...gone.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.433
Dead?

20:28.720 --> 20:33.475
I'm so sorry, George.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.277
Yeah, me too.

20:39.040 --> 20:40.189
Poor Lilly.

20:40.360 --> 20:42.191
-Susan.
-Susan.

20:47.360 --> 20:49.828
-How did it happen?
-Apparently the glue...

20:50.000 --> 20:53.117
...in the wedding invitations was...

20:54.320 --> 20:55.958
...toxic.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.712
Well, that's weird.

21:02.320 --> 21:04.197
So I guess...

21:04.840 --> 21:07.912
-...you're not getting married.
-Yeah.

21:09.720 --> 21:11.153
But....

21:12.800 --> 21:16.588
-Yeah?
-Well, now I'm engaged.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.194
Yeah?

21:18.560 --> 21:20.471
Well, I thought
we'd both be getting married.

21:21.520 --> 21:23.988
Hey, what can I tell you?

21:24.280 --> 21:25.429
All right.

21:27.040 --> 21:28.951
Well, let's get some coffee.

21:30.160 --> 21:32.469
We had a pact!

21:39.800 --> 21:43.110
Yes, I'd like to speak
with Marisa Tomei, please.

21:44.760 --> 21:48.753
Marisa, hi. It's George Costanza.

21:48.960 --> 21:53.351
I'm the short, funny, quirky
bald man you met a little while ago.

21:53.520 --> 21:55.875
Yeah, I was just calling
because I wanted you to know...

21:56.040 --> 21:59.191
...that I'm not engaged anymore.

21:59.720 --> 22:01.995
Well, she died.

22:02.760 --> 22:05.877
Toxic glue
from the wedding invitations.

22:06.560 --> 22:09.279
Well, we were expecting
about 200 people.

22:09.640 --> 22:14.395
Yeah. Anyway,
I've got the funeral tomorrow...

22:15.920 --> 22:18.388
...but my weekend
is pretty wide open...

22:19.200 --> 22:22.397
...and, you know,
I was wondering-- Hello?

22:22.560 --> 22:24.152
Hello?

22:25.305 --> 22:31.463
