Oh, hey. Hey, man.

13:09.580 --> 13:12.810
Come on, Uncle Phil,
let's look at the bright side here. Eh?

13:12.980 --> 13:18.480
Now our little penthouse got central air.
Whoosh.

13:19.220 --> 13:21.190
Ventilation.

13:21.520 --> 13:23.820
Yeah. That will have the tenants
just flocking in.

13:23.990 --> 13:25.580
And so will this.

what kind of vermin are in here?

13:33.870 --> 13:35.500
How do?

13:36.370 --> 13:39.030
I don't have time for you, Jazz.
I have to meet with the head...

13:39.210 --> 13:42.770
...of the tenants association.
- Okay. Before I go, this'll make you laugh.

13:42.940 --> 13:44.840
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

13:45.010 --> 13:46.950
The head of the tenants association.
That's me.

13:49.350 --> 13:50.940
But wait a minute.

13:51.120 --> 13:53.520
Jazz, you mean you're the person
that's suing my uncle?

13:53.690 --> 13:57.350
- Man, what were you thinking about?
- Just trying to protect your investment.

13:57.530 --> 14:02.160
After you put a couple of million dollars
in this place, it'll be worth thousands.

14:02.800 --> 14:05.530
Can I see the list of complaints, please?

14:12.210 --> 14:15.660
"Somebody keep making them
damn Chevy Chase movies.

14:17.310 --> 14:21.010
Dude in apartment 3G
keep calling me sugar drawers. "

14:21.650 --> 14:24.450
Complaints about the building, Jazz.

14:24.620 --> 14:27.180
I think they kick in right here, Uncle Phil.

14:27.620 --> 14:30.890
"Sticky stuff on the stairs tastes bitter. "

14:32.160 --> 14:34.490
Oh, my God, let me see this.

14:34.660 --> 14:37.560
I only have seven days
to bring every violation up to code...

14:37.730 --> 14:39.260
...and look at all of these.

14:39.800 --> 14:42.060
Look, you want me to start calling
repairmen?

14:42.240 --> 14:44.070
No. He wants you to call the idiot...

14:44.240 --> 14:46.710
...who keeps greenlighting
all those Chevy Chase movies.

14:47.680 --> 14:51.170
Carlton, let's get a move on.
While Will's calling, we'll check everything.

14:51.350 --> 14:54.440
- Start from the roof, work our way down.
- Right behind you.

14:54.620 --> 14:58.280
Oh, I bet you are, Carlton.
Because you can't kiss his butt from here.

14:59.720 --> 15:04.950
Good one, Master William. Ha, ha.
Ha-ha-ha.

15:08.430 --> 15:09.690
Oh, well, look at this.

15:09.860 --> 15:14.270
A cracked mirror, peeling paint.
Come on, all this stuff is cosmetic.

15:14.440 --> 15:17.340
I still think we got ourselves
a sound investment here.

15:17.510 --> 15:18.730
CARLTON:
Dad, come over here.

with newspaper?

15:55.740 --> 15:57.540
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
Very little.

15:57.710 --> 16:01.370
Half of our workers didn't show up
and we are not exactly professionals.

16:01.550 --> 16:05.280
We got a ton of work to do
and we got less than four days to do it in.

16:05.450 --> 16:07.040
What's this "we" business?

16:07.220 --> 16:10.420
I'm here for one reason only.
To protect Dad's investment.

16:10.590 --> 16:14.490
If your dad gets sued for everything he got,
who's gonna protect you?

16:15.660 --> 16:17.600
- Let me at it.
- All right. Hey, look.

16:17.770 --> 16:21.220
Just hold the flashlight into the fuse box
so I can see. Please?

- Bunny rabbit. Ha, ha.

Look. An American eagle with one wing.

16:38.950 --> 16:40.920
Stop it, Carlton.

16:41.390 --> 16:44.480
Now, put it back in the fuse box, please.
This is dangerous.

16:44.660 --> 16:46.420
Not if you know how to read.

16:46.590 --> 16:48.990
Look, it says touch here.

- But wait. There's more.

Not bad, all things considered.
In fact, this week was kind of invigorating.

18:40.510 --> 18:43.530
Which reminds me,
I think I'm gonna go freshen up.

18:43.710 --> 18:47.150

- Like hell?

Hell looks a lot better than this, I hope.

Don't worry.
Since the repairmen didn't show up...

19:02.600 --> 19:04.890
