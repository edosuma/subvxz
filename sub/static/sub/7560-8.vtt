00:18.036 --> 00:23.666
Oh, sorry. I could be wrong,
but I think this is my piece of fruit.

00:27.378 --> 00:29.213
Drop it, you mangy liyote.

00:29.297 --> 00:33.134
I only share food with my
family and my tapeworms.

00:33.802 --> 00:35.653
You know what? Take it.

00:35.654 --> 00:38.431
Say hi to the wife and pack for me.

00:38.974 --> 00:42.102
Have you gone soft?
You just handed him that fruit.

00:42.184 --> 00:47.065
- Didn't even spit on it first.
- We're not in the tar pits anymore, Mom.

00:47.147 --> 00:51.319
Here in the valley, we need to
get along, control our wild sides.

00:51.402 --> 00:55.531
Trying to control wild is like
plugging a volcano with a rock.

00:55.615 --> 00:57.283
Eventually, it's gonna blow.

00:57.366 --> 01:00.578
Mom, we're not animals.

01:00.662 --> 01:04.081
Oh, don't act all "I walk upright."

01:04.165 --> 01:06.876
You give these critters an inch
and they'll take a child!

01:06.960 --> 01:09.004
That's not a saying.

01:12.007 --> 01:14.009
See? That's why it's a saying!

01:14.092 --> 01:15.677
Hey, drop my Sandy!

01:15.760 --> 01:18.096
I don't run off with your pups
in my mouth!

01:30.733 --> 01:33.945
Enough! 
Give me back my baby!

01:44.956 --> 01:46.499
Oh... oh.

01:57.719 --> 02:01.389
You can't ask a liyote
to give you your baby back.

02:02.807 --> 02:05.887
- What are you thinking?
- I'm thinking...

02:05.922 --> 02:07.937
I lost my growl.

02:15.821 --> 02:18.233
<b>1x08 - "Mom Genes"</b>

02:29.625 --> 02:32.427
Okay, Sandy, Mommy lost her growl,

02:32.428 --> 02:34.296
but that's no big deal, right?

02:35.256 --> 02:40.762
- Mom, Thunk's reading my diary again!
- You drew it on a wall.

02:40.845 --> 02:43.264
You know how much I love
staring at walls.

02:43.347 --> 02:45.808
Eep, if you don't want your brother
to know your feelings,

02:45.892 --> 02:50.025
- keep them in your inner cave.
- Don't tell her that.

02:50.060 --> 02:53.524
Reading her diary is the
most fun I get around here.

02:53.942 --> 02:57.862
Can't wait to find out if you talked
to that cute cave boy today.

03:06.579 --> 03:09.665
Everyone, please.
Settle down.

03:09.749 --> 03:12.668
Who's hungry for chikuna?

03:14.212 --> 03:16.422
Again? I'd rather starve.

03:17.506 --> 03:20.768
- Sounds like a plan to me.
- Stop it, all of you!

03:20.803 --> 03:24.055
I've got a pounding
head-y ache-y thing,

03:24.139 --> 03:26.641
<i>and I can't handle all of you
barking at each other!</i>

03:30.979 --> 03:33.022
Hey, hey, hey,
everything okay, hon?

03:33.106 --> 03:34.690
I mean, I'm sorry
this isn't the best dinner,

03:34.774 --> 03:37.902
but prey's been a little scarce
since it's the off-season

03:37.986 --> 03:40.321
when a lot of hunters die off.

03:40.404 --> 03:42.782
It ain't her grub. It's her "grr."

03:42.865 --> 03:48.329
- It's her what?
- Grug, I've... lost my growl.

03:49.872 --> 03:54.127
Whoa, Mom.
You used to have a growl?

03:54.210 --> 03:58.673
But you're our mom.
Moms can't have growls, can they?

03:58.756 --> 04:00.549
Kids, your mother's growl is terrifying.

04:00.633 --> 04:02.844
That's how I knew
she was the woman for me,

04:02.927 --> 04:07.182
and why I'm sure it's just
the stress of the kids, your mother.

04:07.265 --> 04:09.976
You know, it's not too late
to tie her up out back.

04:10.059 --> 04:12.228
It's not that. It's just...

04:12.312 --> 04:15.982
I've lost touch with my wild side.
I think I need...

04:17.065 --> 04:19.194
a change.

04:19.277 --> 04:22.530
No, no, no!
I did not hear that word!

04:22.613 --> 04:25.741
What word, Dad? "Change"?

04:25.825 --> 04:28.402
What is it with this
family and that word?

04:28.403 --> 04:32.041
- It always means trouble.
- Oh, caveman up, Grug.

04:32.076 --> 04:34.375
There's an easy fix here.

04:34.458 --> 04:37.920
You need hunters, and Ugga
needs to get her growl back.

04:38.004 --> 04:41.216
Oh, come on.
Ugga doesn't wanna join the hunt.

04:41.299 --> 04:43.134
Do ya?

04:44.260 --> 04:47.596
Actually, yeah, I do.

04:47.680 --> 04:51.433
Remember all of those moonlit hunts
before we got married?

04:51.517 --> 04:55.521
Yeah. Just you and me
and a fresh carcass.

04:55.604 --> 04:59.734
So, how about one day back
on the hunting field? That should do it.

04:59.817 --> 05:02.153
One day ain't gonna do it.

05:02.237 --> 05:05.573
Oh, fine. You can find
me reading Eep's diary

05:05.574 --> 05:07.408
when you need to tell me I was right.

05:07.491 --> 05:08.951
No, no. No more diary, Gran!

05:10.452 --> 05:11.996
<i> Hey!</i>

05:12.580 --> 05:15.875
He-hey! Ugga, this is the hunting party.

05:15.958 --> 05:20.296
- Hunting party, Ugga.
- Hi. How you doing, Munk?

05:22.840 --> 05:24.998
Uh... mmm...
I don't know.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.635
You know, nobody's
asked me in a long time.

05:26.719 --> 05:29.138
I... I'll need to get back to you.

05:30.639 --> 05:35.519
- And that is Amber. She's...
- Boss of hunt.

05:37.230 --> 05:39.899
Wow.
That was loud.

05:39.982 --> 05:42.401
I'm Ugga. We met at Family Day.

05:42.402 --> 05:46.614
- We were both in the rib-eating contest.
- Amber meet a lot of people.

05:46.948 --> 05:51.660
- You bit my arm?
- Amber also bite a lot of people.

05:51.744 --> 05:54.705
Sweetie, don't taunt the Amber.

05:56.999 --> 06:01.629
She smell like flower.
Pretty. Easy to crush.

06:07.260 --> 06:09.971
Yeah!

06:11.222 --> 06:14.474
She might smell pretty,
but she's ugly where it counts.

06:14.558 --> 06:19.479
Before I met Grug,
I was the best whapper in my tribe.

06:23.985 --> 06:27.571
You know, when you bend
the branches back,

06:27.655 --> 06:31.284
and then you let go,
and then... uh... "whap"?

06:32.743 --> 06:35.621
No want whap. Want lookout.

06:35.704 --> 06:37.290
<i> You want me to climb a tree?</i>

06:37.373 --> 06:39.625
Uh... thing is, Amber, you know,

06:39.708 --> 06:42.586
Ugga was really hoping
to get her claws dirty today.

06:42.670 --> 06:44.964
No, no, Grug, I came to help.

06:45.047 --> 06:48.801
If Amber wants an extra pair
of eyes, she can use mine.

06:48.884 --> 06:51.152
Uh, not that you need a pair.

06:51.153 --> 06:54.556
I mean, there's no right
amount of eyes to have.

06:54.640 --> 06:56.558
I'm just gonna go climb a tree.

06:58.311 --> 07:01.251
I don't know about this,
Gran. If Mom and Dad come

07:01.252 --> 07:04.192
home with food, our mouths
won't be there to eat it.

07:04.275 --> 07:07.820
Nuh-uh. I ain't letting
you kids get all stir

07:07.821 --> 07:11.366
crazy in a cave like your mother.
Today, we hunt!

07:16.620 --> 07:18.998
See? Baby Teeth gets it.

07:20.582 --> 07:22.793
But next time, chew.

07:31.802 --> 07:34.430
- Sandy picked a climber.
- I'll grab her.

07:34.514 --> 07:38.559
No, not you. We know the girls
in this family can do wild.

07:38.642 --> 07:41.437
The boys are the ones
who need to get a push

07:41.438 --> 07:44.232
out of the nest.
Thunk, you go get Sandy.

07:45.816 --> 07:47.109
Uh...

07:49.487 --> 07:53.741
- Um, uh, me?
- You can do it, boy.

07:54.616 --> 07:57.203
And if not, well, he had a good run.

08:01.874 --> 08:05.753
Hey, I did it! I conquered my fear.
You hear that, Sandy?

08:08.423 --> 08:10.341
Ow!

08:12.260 --> 08:14.011
Never mind. My fear is back.

08:15.263 --> 08:19.392
You found a pugott.
They're as tasty as they are rare.

08:19.475 --> 08:21.810
- Let's split it four ways.
- But...

08:22.728 --> 08:24.772
<i>its eyes, they're so big.</i>

08:24.855 --> 08:28.276
- And packed with flavor.
- No! He's mine.

08:41.539 --> 08:46.461
Well, that's a predator's instinct.
Knew you had it in you, kid.

08:48.670 --> 08:51.840
Got a new scent, girl?
Okay, take us to the prey.

08:51.924 --> 08:53.525
You guys go ahead.

08:53.526 --> 08:55.928
I'm just gonna... mark some territory.

08:59.348 --> 09:01.100
Better get somewhere safe, fella.

09:03.894 --> 09:06.063
Not what I meant.

09:06.147 --> 09:07.565
There's no milk in there.

09:07.731 --> 09:09.942
Looking good up there, honey!

09:10.025 --> 09:11.652
Is she looking good up there, Munk?

09:11.735 --> 09:15.030
I can't see. The stupid sun,
it thinks it owns the sky.

09:15.114 --> 09:17.699
Don't let it hear you say that.
It'll burn you with its hate rays.

09:17.783 --> 09:19.577
He didn't mean it!

09:20.453 --> 09:23.122
Go hunting. Get your growl on.

09:23.205 --> 09:26.125
Was I ever howling up the wrong...

09:28.877 --> 09:30.754
Whoa. Grug.

09:37.470 --> 09:40.722
Is Ugga trying to cough up a bird?
Been there.

09:40.806 --> 09:43.017
Maybe she's trying to tell us something.

09:43.100 --> 09:45.520
Lunchtime already?

09:47.896 --> 09:49.898
I think we are the lunch.

10:06.915 --> 10:10.169
Predator stance.
Make us big.

10:17.593 --> 10:20.971
Prey stance. Kiss butts goodbye.

10:27.269 --> 10:29.104
What that?

10:29.564 --> 10:32.233
That is how you whap.

10:41.742 --> 10:44.828
<i>Kids, thank your mother
for your wart frog gifts.</i>

10:44.912 --> 10:47.873
And, Gran, stop smiling at me.
It's creepy.

10:49.750 --> 10:53.337
Thanks, Mom.
Guess you really can growl.

10:53.421 --> 10:56.798
Hey, does this mean
someday I'll get your growl?

10:56.882 --> 11:00.678
Hope it comes in soon.
Your diary could use some excitement.

11:00.761 --> 11:03.580
- Gran!
- Let's thank hunting.

11:03.615 --> 11:08.143
I feel so alive.
Every sight, sound, and smell...

11:11.105 --> 11:13.399
- What smells?
- Uh...

11:15.234 --> 11:18.862
- Yeah, that was definitely me.
- Way to own it, son.

11:18.946 --> 11:21.031
Ugga, you've outdone yourself,

11:21.115 --> 11:23.325
and you've especially outdone Grug.

11:23.409 --> 11:27.580
- Oh, think what you'll catch tomorrow.
- Oh, no. We said one day.

11:27.581 --> 11:30.583
I had my fun.
Time to go back to normal.

11:30.666 --> 11:35.361
<i>Quit it! Quit it! Quit it!</i>

11:35.421 --> 11:40.468
Okay, maybe one more day.
Grug?

11:41.218 --> 11:44.930
Okay, sure. I mean, as long as
Amber and the guys go for it.

11:45.013 --> 11:47.767
Grug!
Can wife come out to hunt?

11:51.646 --> 11:55.149
Amber ready to learn
from Ugga about big prey.

11:55.232 --> 11:59.361
Well, in my old pack, when
predators snuck up from behind...

11:59.445 --> 12:02.281
- Uh, Grug?
- Right. Sorry.

12:02.906 --> 12:04.742
Roar.

12:04.824 --> 12:05.867
Ow!

12:05.951 --> 12:08.870
We'd just flip and pound.
See?

12:09.955 --> 12:14.293
Yeah. Super educational, hon.
Hey, you okay?

12:17.755 --> 12:22.884
I feel different.
I finally found my calling.

12:22.968 --> 12:25.387
The call of the wild!

13:11.183 --> 13:15.103
Ugga prove she best hunter.
Now, she boss of hunt.

13:15.187 --> 13:17.523
You had two good eyes
this whole time?

13:17.606 --> 13:21.819
- What's with the eyepatch?
- Uh. Went nice with pelt.

13:22.778 --> 13:26.948
Now, we celebrate.
First round of smash fruit on me!

13:29.451 --> 13:31.411
No, smash fruit is for catchers,

13:31.412 --> 13:34.759
and we still have prey to catch.

13:38.960 --> 13:40.796
<i>Uh, guys...</i>

13:40.880 --> 13:43.883
still hanging.
Roar?

13:44.550 --> 13:46.093
<i>Guys?</i>

13:50.723 --> 13:54.894
Can't believe I'm saying this,
but I don't think I can eat anymore.

13:54.976 --> 13:57.605
My eyes say keep eating,

13:57.688 --> 14:00.649
but my stomach says...

14:03.778 --> 14:07.656
Well, finally happened.
I'm full.

14:07.740 --> 14:10.659
Well, at least Thunk's still
thinking with his stomach.

14:17.165 --> 14:21.128
Yeah.
Who's a good belly? You are.

14:22.588 --> 14:26.425
Okay, you all need to digest.
Point taken.

14:26.508 --> 14:29.553
How about I go scare up some
girelephant for dessert later?

14:29.637 --> 14:31.321
Honey, come on. Take a break.

14:31.322 --> 14:33.849
We've got enough food
to last the season.

14:33.933 --> 14:38.228
Oh, I know there's tastier prey
out there, Grug. I can smell it.

14:43.191 --> 14:47.070
Can I be excused?
I think my tummy's upset with me.

14:48.906 --> 14:50.783
Let's never fight like that.

14:52.993 --> 14:56.246
You gotta go, little guy.
It's not safe for you here.

14:56.330 --> 15:01.126
And if you stay, I'm just
gonna name you... Earl?

15:01.209 --> 15:04.212
Are you an "Earl"?
No, no. Just go.

15:08.300 --> 15:11.219
Ew! You're supposed
to do that in the bushes.

15:11.303 --> 15:12.763
Eep! Ah! Uh...

15:12.847 --> 15:15.808
I'm just...
making room for dessert?

15:19.394 --> 15:21.313
No, Sandy!

15:30.990 --> 15:32.925
You never ate this pugott.

15:32.926 --> 15:35.828
Ha! I knew you didn't
have the stomach for it.

15:35.911 --> 15:38.995
I had the stomach.
I just didn't wanna put him in it.

15:38.998 --> 15:43.251
- Don't tell.
- But you know what we do with prey.

15:48.716 --> 15:53.303
We cuddle the sweet,
adorable little prey. Yes, we do.

15:56.431 --> 16:00.310
No, Sandy. New rule.
We only eat ugly animals.

16:05.357 --> 16:08.986
What? Ugga? Have you
been up all night hunting?

16:09.069 --> 16:13.323
No. No, no, no.
This crawled into my mouth.

16:20.039 --> 16:21.331
Yeah.

16:21.415 --> 16:24.793
Ugga, we seriously need to talk.

16:24.877 --> 16:26.837
<i>Sorry, honey. Morning hunt!</i>

16:30.507 --> 16:32.467
What is happening to her?

16:32.551 --> 16:35.804
She's been taming her wild
for too long, that's what.

16:35.888 --> 16:38.223
And now that the rock's out
of the volcano, it's about to...

16:39.934 --> 16:42.436
Check that. It just blew!

16:50.110 --> 16:52.528
You call that bonking?

16:52.529 --> 16:56.157
Come on, look alive out there, people!

16:56.241 --> 17:00.495
That's not looking alive, Munk.
Are those tears I see?

17:01.121 --> 17:05.084
Eye sweat. Too... t-tired to cry.

17:05.165 --> 17:08.796
Shh-shh-shh.
It's okay. I understand.

17:09.880 --> 17:12.633
Get this one on a bait shift!

17:13.925 --> 17:15.694
The rest of you, new rule.

17:15.694 --> 17:21.474
Ten bonks each by the end of the
day, or I hunt you for dinner.

17:24.936 --> 17:26.814
Uh, sweetie?

17:27.772 --> 17:31.526
Whoa! We really need to talk.

17:31.610 --> 17:34.989
- Time is prey. Go.
- Well, the guys are exhausted.

17:35.072 --> 17:36.823
Even the predators
have gone into hiding.

17:36.824 --> 17:39.910
- Something's got them all spooked.
- You!

17:39.994 --> 17:42.997
You want some of this?
Well, here I am!

17:43.080 --> 17:44.899
<i>Come and get me!</i>

17:45.248 --> 17:48.135
Ugga, come on.
Take a break.

17:48.147 --> 17:51.171
Just take a break.
We could all use a break.

17:51.254 --> 17:54.091
You want a break?
You got it.

17:56.259 --> 17:59.138
Can't believe she made me lookout.

17:59.220 --> 18:01.849
Shh. No taunt the Ugga.

18:08.480 --> 18:09.439
<i> Honey...</i>

18:10.024 --> 18:13.276
we decided to draw
our feelings on a rock

18:13.360 --> 18:15.612
to show you how your hunting
has affected us.

18:15.696 --> 18:20.241
Now, I drew...
Dang it, it got smudged.

18:20.325 --> 18:24.204
Your hunting makes me
feel... smudge-y. Gran.

18:24.621 --> 18:29.126
Um, honey, you've acted
like a complete beast lately,

18:29.209 --> 18:32.420
and I for one have never
been prouder of...

18:32.504 --> 18:35.966
- Gran!
- Oh, fine. My rock's blank.

18:36.050 --> 18:38.176
I never learned how to pictogram.

18:38.177 --> 18:41.364
- Is that what you all wanna hear?
- Moving on.

18:41.399 --> 18:44.558
Eep, didn't you have
something to show to Mommy?

18:44.641 --> 18:46.560
- Mm-hmm.
- See, Ugga?

18:46.643 --> 18:48.979
Look at your daughter's scared face.

18:49.063 --> 18:52.191
Oh, uh, that's not my face.

18:52.273 --> 18:55.485
That's how my stomach felt
after Mom made us eat all that food.

18:55.569 --> 18:57.787
I drew a bird with muscle arms.

18:57.788 --> 19:01.116
I'm not sure I got
what we're doing here.

19:01.200 --> 19:03.535
All right. Um, Ugga,

19:03.618 --> 19:07.206
you're a cold-blooded killer
and I love that about you.

19:07.330 --> 19:10.417
All I'm asking
is you take it down a notch.

19:10.500 --> 19:14.379
I just got my growl back,
and I'm not about to lose it again.

19:14.462 --> 19:17.132
Not when I still smell...

19:17.216 --> 19:19.593
smell...

19:19.676 --> 19:21.553
smell...

19:22.888 --> 19:25.374
...prey.

19:28.268 --> 19:31.146
Wait! You can't.
He's my baby!

19:33.732 --> 19:36.485
Uh... you know, in that
way a random animal you

19:36.486 --> 19:39.238
find in a cave comes to
think of you as its mama.

19:39.320 --> 19:43.408
Sometimes I think we did not
drop that boy hard enough.

19:43.491 --> 19:47.204
Thunk, step away from the prey.

19:47.287 --> 19:52.000
Mom, you can't. It's friendly.

19:54.586 --> 19:57.256
- Ish.
<i>- His name is Earl.</i>

19:57.338 --> 20:00.092
Give me back my son,
you delicious monster!

20:15.274 --> 20:16.650
Oh, it's Ugga.

20:36.962 --> 20:38.213
Mom, it's okay.

20:38.214 --> 20:41.967
Earl just got scared and
protected me. He's nice.

20:44.052 --> 20:46.096
<i>Can't vouch for that one, though.</i>

20:52.936 --> 20:55.856
You call that a growl?

21:03.738 --> 21:06.283
It's a... mama?

21:07.159 --> 21:10.287
And I'm a... monster.

21:19.379 --> 21:22.674
I'll miss you, too, fella.

21:24.676 --> 21:28.074
I still have a nose, right?

21:28.471 --> 21:31.308
Grug, I am so sorry.

21:32.475 --> 21:34.493
It felt so good to be wild again,

21:34.494 --> 21:37.522
but I didn't mean to become a monster.

21:37.605 --> 21:40.275
I guess it's time
to put away these claws.

21:40.359 --> 21:43.362
Ugga, all the prettiest
flowers have thorns.

21:43.444 --> 21:45.405
From now on, how about this?

21:45.488 --> 21:48.033
You help me with the hunt,
I'll help you at home,

21:48.116 --> 21:50.327
and we both keep our growls.

21:55.790 --> 21:58.543
Oh. Hey. How about that?

21:58.626 --> 22:02.047
I'm not full anymore.
Anyone besides me hungry?

22:03.882 --> 22:07.677
Boy, are you in luck.
We've got plenty to go around.

22:09.596 --> 22:13.474
Who wants free meat?
No hunting necessary.

22:15.018 --> 22:17.604
Ah, but you do have to catch it.

22:22.317 --> 22:24.361
Here. Have some meat.

22:25.946 --> 22:28.865
But if you ever so much as look
cross-eyed at my baby again,

22:28.949 --> 22:33.161
I'm gonna start wearing liyote fur coats.
You hear me?

22:38.125 --> 22:40.721
Say hi to the wife and cubs for me!

22:40.940 --> 22:43.637
