00:02.500 --> 00:05.250
[dramatic music]

00:18.500 --> 00:20.583
(female #1)
'Environmental controls hit.'

00:20.667 --> 00:23.083
Do we have enough power to jump?

00:23.167 --> 00:24.458
Only if we go right now.

00:24.542 --> 00:26.375
[sighs]
Prepare for jump.

00:26.458 --> 00:27.917
[music continues]

00:28.000 --> 00:29.917
(female #1)
'I'm picking up
a distress signal.'

00:30.000 --> 00:32.417
It's one of
the evacuation transports.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.083
It didn't make it out
with the rest.

00:34.167 --> 00:35.750
Shruck. How many?

00:35.833 --> 00:38.292
(female #1)
'Seven hundred
of our females and children.'

00:38.375 --> 00:41.458
'Centauri forces
closing on their position.'

00:41.542 --> 00:44.167
[music continues]

00:46.667 --> 00:49.042
Keep the jump point open
as long as you can.

00:49.125 --> 00:52.083
And put us between the civilians
and the war cruiser.

00:52.167 --> 00:53.958
Changing course.

00:54.042 --> 00:57.042
[gunfire]

01:12.042 --> 01:14.833
[music continues]

01:17.250 --> 01:19.458
Transport away.

01:19.542 --> 01:21.083
She's safe.

01:38.500 --> 01:40.333
End.

01:40.417 --> 01:42.292
(male #1)
'Lights.'

01:47.917 --> 01:49.417
Five thousand of my people died

01:49.500 --> 01:52.125
in the battle
you have just seen.

01:52.208 --> 01:53.708
The Centauri
attacked without warning

01:53.792 --> 01:58.042
despite their promise not
to strike civilian targets.

01:58.125 --> 01:59.500
Had our ships
not arrived in time

01:59.583 --> 02:01.375
had they not made
the supreme sacrifice

02:01.458 --> 02:04.167
to save the colony's
civilian population

02:04.250 --> 02:05.833
the Centauri would have
slaughtered everyone.

02:05.917 --> 02:09.417
Females, children, the old,
the infirm, everyone

02:09.500 --> 02:10.958
without cause!

02:11.042 --> 02:13.417
I thought Londo was going
to be here to make a rebuttal.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.458
He's issued a statement
saying that his government

02:15.542 --> 02:17.208
didn't break its promise.

02:17.292 --> 02:18.375
He accuses the Narns

02:18.458 --> 02:19.792
of deliberately placing
military targets

02:19.875 --> 02:21.208
within the civilian population

02:21.292 --> 02:23.708
in order to use their
own people as shields.

02:23.792 --> 02:25.000
'He also said'

02:25.083 --> 02:27.792
the escaping transport
contained weapons

02:27.875 --> 02:28.875
not refugees.

02:28.958 --> 02:30.000
That's a lie!

02:30.083 --> 02:31.417
These are atrocities!

02:31.500 --> 02:33.875
Surely you see that.
see that!

02:33.958 --> 02:37.125
G'Kar, everyone in this room
knows too well

02:37.208 --> 02:38.750
that the first casualty of war

02:38.833 --> 02:40.125
is always the truth.

02:40.208 --> 02:43.000
Unfortunately, the rest
tend to be too small

02:43.083 --> 02:45.708
or too weak
to defend themselves.

02:45.792 --> 02:47.875
Then you believe me.

02:47.958 --> 02:49.375
You'll intervene?

02:54.333 --> 02:56.917
I can't promise anything.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.875
But I'll talk to my government.

02:58.958 --> 03:00.458
That's all I ask.

03:00.542 --> 03:03.042
If Earth takes a stand,
the rest will follow.

03:03.125 --> 03:04.958
I know they will.

03:05.042 --> 03:06.292
Thank you, captain.

03:11.083 --> 03:13.458
[machine beeps]
Sheridan. Talk to me.

03:13.542 --> 03:14.917
(male #2)
'That ship you've been
waiting for'

03:15.000 --> 03:17.458
'is about to come out
of hyperspace, captain.'

03:17.542 --> 03:19.042
On our way.

03:20.708 --> 03:23.542
[instrumental music]

03:31.875 --> 03:33.292
(Susan)
'I guess the diplomatic
office back home'

03:33.375 --> 03:34.625
was ripe for a change.

03:34.708 --> 03:36.875
The Lumati look like
a pretty advanced civilization.

03:36.958 --> 03:38.958
That's why they want
this to go smoothly.

03:39.042 --> 03:41.958
With the war heating up, we need
to get more races on board.

03:42.042 --> 03:43.500
Either as allies or

03:43.583 --> 03:45.125
in the league
of nonaligned worlds.

03:45.208 --> 03:46.583
You sure you don't want
to take care of this?

03:46.667 --> 03:48.042
I mean, if it's this important.

03:48.125 --> 03:50.292
I'm up to my ears
in this whole Narn situation.

03:50.375 --> 03:52.625
Consider it
one more step in learning

03:52.708 --> 03:55.000
(both)
the fine art of diplomacy.

03:55.083 --> 03:56.958
We don't have any other
important ships coming in

03:57.042 --> 04:00.000
so you'll be free to stick
with it until you're finished.

04:00.083 --> 04:02.125
Do whatever you have to.

04:02.208 --> 04:04.250
Just get them to sign on.

04:04.333 --> 04:05.792
Will do.

04:05.875 --> 04:06.958
Thank you, sir.

04:07.042 --> 04:09.792
[instrumental music]

04:18.875 --> 04:23.000
(male narrator)
The Babylon project was
our last best hope for peace.

04:24.333 --> 04:27.125
A self contained world
five miles long

04:27.208 --> 04:29.583
located in neutral territory.

04:32.792 --> 04:35.000
A place of commerce
and diplomacy

04:35.083 --> 04:38.667
for a quarter of a million
humans and aliens.

04:38.750 --> 04:41.875
A shining beacon in space.

04:41.958 --> 04:43.917
All alone in the night.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.375
It was the dawn
of the third age of mankind

04:47.458 --> 04:50.417
the year the great war
came upon us all.

04:52.042 --> 04:53.333
This is the story

04:53.417 --> 04:55.792
of the last
of the Babylon stations.

04:55.875 --> 04:58.167
The year is 2259.

04:58.250 --> 05:01.042
The name of the place
is Babylon 5.

05:01.125 --> 05:03.667
[theme music]

06:02.708 --> 06:05.417
I must confess, I find
this report deeply distressing

06:05.500 --> 06:07.458
Ambassador G'Kar.

06:07.542 --> 06:10.083
There is no excuse,
political or military

06:10.167 --> 06:11.792
for the deliberate
killing of civilians.

06:11.875 --> 06:14.875
Oh, then your people
will come in on our side?

06:14.958 --> 06:17.292
It would mean a great deal
to my world, Delenn.

06:17.375 --> 06:19.625
The war is young, the Centauri
are still in the process

06:19.708 --> 06:21.292
of committing their forces.

06:21.375 --> 06:24.125
Some in their government are
unsure about the entire affair.

06:24.208 --> 06:27.000
They only need a reason
not to fight.

06:27.083 --> 06:30.292
If the Minbari intervene,
you could provide that reason.

06:30.375 --> 06:32.792
You could save hundreds
of thousands of lives.

06:32.875 --> 06:34.625
Narn lives.

06:34.708 --> 06:36.417
And Centauri.

06:36.500 --> 06:39.208
But you said many times
that you would never rest

06:39.292 --> 06:42.292
until the Centauri
had been utterly destroyed.

06:42.375 --> 06:43.958
'So, do we help you now?'

06:44.042 --> 06:45.542
Knowing that in a few years

06:45.625 --> 06:47.792
when your force
is at full strength

06:47.875 --> 06:50.750
the Centauri will ask us
for help against you.

06:52.375 --> 06:55.958
You must know that
your actions in the recent past

06:56.042 --> 06:58.333
the things you've said..

06:58.417 --> 06:59.750
...they make it difficult
for anyone

06:59.833 --> 07:01.958
to come to your aid now.

07:02.042 --> 07:03.083
I know.

07:05.375 --> 07:07.708
But what else could I do?

07:07.792 --> 07:09.250
When you have been crushed
beneath the wheel

07:09.333 --> 07:10.833
for as long as we have

07:10.917 --> 07:14.667
revenge occupies
your every waking thought.

07:14.750 --> 07:17.750
When everything else
had been taken from us..

07:17.833 --> 07:20.208
...our hatred kept us alive.

07:20.292 --> 07:22.583
And now, it may destroy you.

07:25.500 --> 07:28.750
Do you want me to beg, Delenn?
Is that it?

07:28.833 --> 07:30.208
No.

07:30.292 --> 07:31.500
Then what is it?

07:33.833 --> 07:36.750
I was there when our war
against Earth began.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.000
When our ship encountered
an Earth vessel

07:40.083 --> 07:42.583
for the first time.

07:42.667 --> 07:45.667
Afraid of us,
of the unknown, they fired.

07:46.625 --> 07:48.708
I saw our leader dying.

07:48.792 --> 07:52.667
I heard the cries for revenge,
for blood, for death.

07:54.042 --> 07:58.208
In return, we nearly
exterminated an entire species.

07:59.708 --> 08:02.542
My people are tired
of war, G'Kar.

08:02.625 --> 08:05.708
You cannot ask them
to go through all that again.

08:07.292 --> 08:10.375
Then we must face
the Centauri alone.

08:10.458 --> 08:12.083
No. Not alone.

08:12.167 --> 08:15.167
The council can bring political
pressure to bear on them.

08:15.250 --> 08:16.375
We can mediate.

08:16.458 --> 08:19.042
There is nothing
to mediate, Delenn.

08:19.125 --> 08:22.208
Unless others choose
to become involved

08:22.292 --> 08:24.583
we will destroy them
or they will destroy us.

08:24.667 --> 08:26.833
There is no in between.

08:28.917 --> 08:30.750
Thank you for the tea, Delenn.

08:30.833 --> 08:33.625
And your...honesty.

08:38.042 --> 08:40.750
To the return of glory!

08:42.500 --> 08:45.417
We should have done this
a long time ago.

08:45.500 --> 08:47.833
The Narns are like the Na'Toths.

08:47.917 --> 08:49.583
Loud, smelly.

08:49.667 --> 08:52.625
They raise their horns
and stomp their feet

08:52.708 --> 08:55.000
but they have no teeth!

08:55.083 --> 08:58.542
It would be a kindness
to put them out of their misery!

08:58.625 --> 09:00.958
[glass shatters]

09:01.042 --> 09:02.875
[growling]

09:03.000 --> 09:04.042
Alright, alright!

09:04.125 --> 09:06.167
Break it up! Break it up!

09:06.250 --> 09:08.208
- They threw a bottle at us!
- He insulted us!

09:08.292 --> 09:10.750
Pipe down! And you, move.

09:10.833 --> 09:13.417
You, too. Come on.
Move. Move! Go on.

09:13.500 --> 09:16.125
- And you watch it.
- Yeah.

09:16.208 --> 09:18.958
[instrumental music]

09:35.125 --> 09:37.000
Welcome to
Eartholine Station, Babylon 5.

09:37.083 --> 09:38.458
I'm Commander Susan Ivanova.

09:38.542 --> 09:41.292
I am Korelu Muzat of the Lumati.

09:41.375 --> 09:42.292
And you are?

09:42.375 --> 09:45.500
I am Korelu Muzat of the Lumati.

09:45.583 --> 09:47.625
Yes, I know.
Thank you. I was asking--

09:47.708 --> 09:50.917
The Serbitrobe beside me
is my translator. Talk.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.833
I speak through him.

09:52.917 --> 09:54.833
Are you incapable of speech?

09:54.917 --> 09:56.417
[Korelu chuckles]
'No, of course not.'

09:56.500 --> 09:58.333
'But it would represent
a loss of face for me'

09:58.417 --> 10:01.167
'to communicate
with an inferior race.'

10:01.250 --> 10:02.750
'Uh, before I can speak
with you directly'

10:02.833 --> 10:05.833
I must determine
if your species is worthy.

10:05.917 --> 10:08.833
Yeah, if so, we may even
allow others of my kind

10:08.917 --> 10:11.167
to honor you
with their presence.

10:11.250 --> 10:15.000
Well, isn't that...wonderful?

10:15.083 --> 10:18.333
Alright. Uh, well,
I guess the best way to start

10:18.417 --> 10:20.625
with your evaluation
would be to take you around

10:20.708 --> 10:21.833
show you the station.

10:21.917 --> 10:23.667
That would be good, yes.

10:23.750 --> 10:26.625
Wonderful.
Please, right this way.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.042
[sighs]

10:31.125 --> 10:33.000
(male #3)
'And we have found difficulty'

10:33.083 --> 10:35.333
in getting our imports
back to Centauri prime

10:35.417 --> 10:38.625
before they spoil
the paperwork, the delays

10:38.708 --> 10:42.250
the constant payments
to certain individuals

10:42.333 --> 10:45.208
to expedite the process.
It's ruining my business.

10:45.292 --> 10:47.375
What do you want me
to do about it, hmm?

10:47.458 --> 10:50.458
A word or two from you
spoken into the right ears

10:50.542 --> 10:52.292
would make all the difference.

10:52.375 --> 10:55.708
Your opinions carry much weight
back home, ambassador.

10:55.792 --> 10:56.958
Ahh.

10:59.250 --> 11:02.167
Ambassador,
a man of your prominence

11:02.250 --> 11:05.375
must have refined
and exotic tastes

11:05.458 --> 11:08.917
but we are far from home.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.042
Certain things
are hard to obtain

11:12.125 --> 11:15.250
even technically illegal.

11:15.333 --> 11:19.000
In exchange for your help,
I could arrange

11:19.083 --> 11:21.208
to have a few of these items

11:21.292 --> 11:24.250
find their way into your hands.

11:24.333 --> 11:26.208
Weeping stones.

11:26.292 --> 11:28.000
Chiquoneth plants.

11:28.083 --> 11:30.917
[sighs deeply]

11:31.000 --> 11:34.417
I will make a few discreet
inquiries, alright?

11:34.500 --> 11:36.875
- Thank you, ambassador.
- Yes.

11:38.917 --> 11:40.208
[exhales sharply]

11:41.833 --> 11:43.458
Shall I log this
in with the rest?

11:43.542 --> 11:46.250
Mm-hmm.

11:46.333 --> 11:48.917
Six months ago they
were hardly aware of me.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.625
And now, suddenly..

11:51.708 --> 11:53.958
...everyone is my friend.

11:54.042 --> 11:56.375
Everyone wants something.

11:57.542 --> 11:59.792
I wanted respect.

11:59.875 --> 12:03.500
Instead I have turned
into a wishing well with legs.

12:07.542 --> 12:09.208
I'm tired, Vir.

12:10.458 --> 12:13.458
Go. Tell the others
to come back tomorrow.

12:13.542 --> 12:15.458
Y-yes, sir.

12:16.542 --> 12:19.375
[grunting]

12:19.458 --> 12:21.500
[intense music]

12:23.042 --> 12:24.625
The mighty Narn, eh?

12:24.708 --> 12:27.000
What's going on here?
Break it up. Break it up.

12:27.083 --> 12:28.500
You, back off.

12:28.583 --> 12:30.292
'Hey, put it down.'

12:30.375 --> 12:31.875
I said put it down!

12:31.958 --> 12:33.250
[screaming]

12:41.917 --> 12:43.208
He's dead.

12:46.917 --> 12:48.500
He was ordered to put down
his weapon. He refused!

12:48.583 --> 12:50.250
He had just been attacked
by the Centauri!

12:50.333 --> 12:51.875
He had the right
to defend himself!

12:51.958 --> 12:54.750
It was your people who started
the incident back in the Zocalo.

12:54.833 --> 12:58.167
- That's not what my--
- Now, look, G'Kar!

12:58.250 --> 13:00.667
We can go round and round
about this all night long

13:00.750 --> 13:02.333
figuring out who started what.

13:02.417 --> 13:05.042
And it'll take us back
a 100 years before we're done.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.375
Now you asked me for help

13:14.458 --> 13:17.375
and I am doing
the best that I can

13:17.458 --> 13:18.542
but incidents like this

13:18.625 --> 13:21.000
are making my job
a hell of a lot harder.

13:23.458 --> 13:25.042
What about Mollari?

13:25.125 --> 13:27.833
I'm sending him
the same message.

13:27.917 --> 13:30.042
Both your people
need to back off.

13:30.125 --> 13:32.042
Babylon 5 is neutral territory.

13:32.125 --> 13:34.708
And I will not have you
turn it into a war zone.

13:34.792 --> 13:36.625
But they have a right
to defend themselves.

13:36.708 --> 13:38.042
'Damn it, G'Kar!'

13:38.125 --> 13:40.125
You are the duly
appointed representative

13:40.208 --> 13:41.750
of your government.

13:41.833 --> 13:45.042
Are you saying that you can't
control your own people?

13:45.125 --> 13:47.417
Because if you can't,
you better tell me right now

13:47.500 --> 13:49.708
so that I can have them
thrown off this station

13:49.792 --> 13:52.417
and sent somewhere else.

13:56.667 --> 13:59.458
[intense music]

14:01.667 --> 14:03.042
[exhales]

14:03.125 --> 14:05.917
...which allows us
to use the isolab

14:06.000 --> 14:07.500
for nonhumanoid patients

14:07.583 --> 14:09.417
requiring
an alternate atmosphere.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.917
'Cause it uses
a self-contained air supply

14:12.000 --> 14:13.750
hermetically sealed
behind an air lock.

14:13.833 --> 14:16.583
The isolab can also be used
for biological research

14:16.667 --> 14:19.750
and identification of
hazardous micro organisms.

14:19.833 --> 14:21.167
Next stop is the infirmary

14:21.250 --> 14:22.750
which is down the hall
to the right.

14:22.833 --> 14:25.458
Follow my assistant.
I'll be with you momentarily.

14:26.833 --> 14:27.917
Commander.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.625
I hope we haven't
caught you at a bad time?

14:29.708 --> 14:32.000
Oh, no, no, just breaking in
some new additions to my staff.

14:32.083 --> 14:35.417
- Welcome to Babylon 5.
- Thank you.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.708
I should explain.
They have some kind of a--

14:37.792 --> 14:39.208
Intracultural symbiosis.

14:39.292 --> 14:41.250
Yes, I've heard of
this sort of thing.

14:41.333 --> 14:43.167
This is my first real encounter
with it, though.

14:43.250 --> 14:45.458
Uh, did you say this facility
was for the treatment

14:45.542 --> 14:48.000
of species other than your own?

14:48.083 --> 14:49.833
Yes, yes, yes,
th-that's correct.

14:49.917 --> 14:52.458
(Korelu)
'I do not understand.
Why go through all this'

14:52.542 --> 14:55.792
'to save the lives of
potentially inferior species?'

14:55.875 --> 14:57.458
'Evolution is driven by blood.'

14:57.542 --> 14:59.583
The weak die
and the strong survive.

14:59.667 --> 15:02.083
By preserving the sick
and wounded of other races

15:02.167 --> 15:04.000
you pollute the genetic pool.

15:04.083 --> 15:05.792
'It does not serve evolution.'

15:05.875 --> 15:07.750
Well, my job isn't
serving evolution.

15:07.833 --> 15:09.875
It's serving humanity.

15:09.958 --> 15:11.292
Even when the patient
isn't human.

15:11.375 --> 15:13.292
Yes, but what happens
when the inferior

15:13.375 --> 15:15.500
saved from the process
of natural selection

15:15.583 --> 15:18.042
begin to outnumber the superior?

15:18.125 --> 15:20.125
You know, I think we should
all be moving on by now.

15:20.208 --> 15:23.125
I don't believe that
any form of sentient life

15:23.208 --> 15:25.292
is inferior to any other.

15:25.375 --> 15:27.083
Yes, we often hear that argument

15:27.167 --> 15:29.458
from inferior species
and their sympathizers.

15:29.542 --> 15:31.167
Just one second.

15:31.250 --> 15:33.000
You're saying that
if you saw a child

15:33.083 --> 15:35.667
from one of these inferior
species bleeding to death

15:35.750 --> 15:37.667
and all you had to do was move
one finger to save it's life

15:37.750 --> 15:38.917
you wouldn't do it?

15:39.000 --> 15:40.500
We would neither
help nor harm them.

15:40.583 --> 15:42.333
It's not our place to interfere.

15:42.417 --> 15:43.958
The way for one race
to help another

15:44.042 --> 15:47.000
is to allow evolution
to run its course.

15:47.083 --> 15:48.750
It's for their own good.

15:48.833 --> 15:50.417
'Well, thank you
for the stimulating'

15:50.500 --> 15:51.708
'conversation, doctor.'

15:51.792 --> 15:53.667
You have some strange notions

15:53.750 --> 15:57.000
but I'm sure they
will pass with time.

15:59.250 --> 16:00.542
I'm sorry.

16:01.667 --> 16:03.708
Strange notions.

16:03.792 --> 16:06.875
Yeah, I got your
strange notions right here.

16:09.667 --> 16:10.833
Oh!

16:10.917 --> 16:12.750
Great maker!

16:12.833 --> 16:17.333
Ah! Ah-ha! Mr. Garibaldi, wait!
A moment of your time.

16:17.417 --> 16:19.042
Let me buy you something.

16:19.125 --> 16:22.167
I will make sure that
it's chemically inoffensive.

16:22.250 --> 16:24.083
- I don't have any--
- Mr. Garibaldi..

16:24.167 --> 16:28.000
A moment of joy
in a lifetime of sorrow.

16:28.083 --> 16:30.125
Take it while you can.

16:32.417 --> 16:34.833
Good. Good.

16:34.917 --> 16:37.583
- Kat, my usual.
- Coming up.

16:38.292 --> 16:40.250
Here..

16:40.333 --> 16:42.208
...I have something for you.

16:46.583 --> 16:47.958
You want to tell me
what this is?

16:48.042 --> 16:49.625
[laughs]

16:49.708 --> 16:52.542
Oh, please relax.
It's not a bribe.

16:52.625 --> 16:55.208
Over the years, when my luck
at the gaming tables

16:55.292 --> 16:57.958
has been less than salutary

16:58.042 --> 16:59.500
you have always
come to my rescue.

16:59.583 --> 17:04.292
And now I repay you
in full, ever last ducat.

17:04.375 --> 17:07.167
- Thanks.
- That's all?

17:07.250 --> 17:09.125
Thanks?

17:09.208 --> 17:10.375
I'll get you a receipt.

17:10.458 --> 17:11.500
Just wanna make
sure everything's--

17:11.583 --> 17:12.917
No, I don't want a receipt!

17:13.000 --> 17:15.500
- Then what do you want?
- I want you to stay!

17:17.542 --> 17:21.375
And have a little drink with me.

17:21.458 --> 17:24.417
I want you to be happy.
I want me to be happy.

17:24.500 --> 17:27.792
I want you to be happy for me
and me to be happy for you.

17:27.875 --> 17:31.042
Is that so much
to ask around here?

17:31.125 --> 17:32.792
Why is everyone here
walking around

17:32.875 --> 17:35.458
like they're afraid of me?

17:35.542 --> 17:38.083
'Cause maybe we are.

17:38.167 --> 17:39.958
What are you talking about?

17:40.042 --> 17:42.583
I would never threaten you
or the others.

17:42.667 --> 17:43.958
Maybe.

17:44.042 --> 17:46.292
Maybe not.

17:46.375 --> 17:49.667
I don't know you anymore, Londo.

17:49.750 --> 17:50.875
None of us do.

17:50.958 --> 17:53.000
No, wait. Please!

17:58.583 --> 18:00.125
Mr. Garibaldi..

18:03.000 --> 18:06.583
In my time here,
very few people on this station

18:06.667 --> 18:10.542
have listened to me
or taken me seriously.

18:10.625 --> 18:12.333
Until recently.

18:12.417 --> 18:15.417
Now I have friends
I never knew were there.

18:16.875 --> 18:19.500
But you..

18:19.583 --> 18:22.708
...you always listen to me.

18:22.792 --> 18:26.583
You are always kind to me, even
when you had nothing to gain.

18:26.667 --> 18:29.208
And now that things
are changing..

18:29.292 --> 18:32.042
...and I look around..

18:32.125 --> 18:34.000
someone

18:34.083 --> 18:36.458
to share my good fortune with..

18:36.542 --> 18:38.958
[scoffs]

18:39.042 --> 18:41.083
...there is no one.

18:45.292 --> 18:47.250
Except you.

18:47.333 --> 18:51.750
My good, close friend.
Garibaldi.

18:56.750 --> 18:59.458
I got to make my rounds.
I'll try to stop by later.

18:59.542 --> 19:02.083
If you're still here
and if I've got the time

19:02.167 --> 19:05.417
I'll have that, uh,
chemically inoffensive drink.

19:05.500 --> 19:07.583
- There's no guarantees.
- None required.

19:07.667 --> 19:09.458
I'll be here, Mr. Garibaldi.

19:09.542 --> 19:11.042
I'll be here.

19:14.750 --> 19:17.125
That was my good friend,
Mr. Garibaldi.

19:19.042 --> 19:22.375
It's good to have friends,
is it not?

19:25.875 --> 19:27.250
Keep the change.

19:29.042 --> 19:32.208
And I'm no happier
about it than you are.

19:32.292 --> 19:34.042
But these outbreaks of violence

19:34.125 --> 19:36.125
are jeopardizing our chance
to make allies

19:36.208 --> 19:38.625
with the humans
and all the other aliens.

19:38.708 --> 19:40.083
We are Narns.

19:40.167 --> 19:42.083
We never needed allies before.

19:42.167 --> 19:44.417
We've never been
in this position before.

19:44.500 --> 19:47.417
We pushed the Centauri off Narn
through a war of attrition

19:47.500 --> 19:50.000
so that it wasn't worth
an effort to stay.

19:50.083 --> 19:53.083
But direct, open and total war

19:53.167 --> 19:56.167
requires a completely
different approach.

19:56.250 --> 19:57.917
He's spent so much time
with the humans

19:58.000 --> 20:00.708
he even talks like them.

20:04.667 --> 20:07.833
I was fighting the Centauri
when you were still a pouchling

20:07.917 --> 20:09.750
fighting for your freedom.

20:09.833 --> 20:11.667
I've spent my life and my blood

20:11.750 --> 20:13.292
trying to better
the lives of our people!

20:13.375 --> 20:15.000
What have you spent?

20:15.083 --> 20:17.917
I will not allow the humans,
or the Centauri, or the Minbari

20:18.000 --> 20:20.417
or anyone else
to hurt that cause.

20:20.500 --> 20:23.125
And that includes you
and everyone else here!

20:23.208 --> 20:25.667
If we do nothing,
we look like weak children.

20:25.750 --> 20:28.250
If you're interested
in showing how strong you are

20:28.333 --> 20:31.583
I suggest you return home
and join the military!

20:31.667 --> 20:34.292
It's easy to talk
here

20:34.375 --> 20:39.167
when there isn't a Centauri ion
cannon pointed at your head!

20:39.250 --> 20:43.750
I know! It is difficult!

20:43.833 --> 20:45.750
But for now..

20:47.167 --> 20:51.208
...we must remain...calm.

20:54.708 --> 20:56.750
Your message is heard.

20:56.833 --> 20:59.708
And understood, G'Kar.

21:08.792 --> 21:11.000
Now we send a message
of our own.

21:11.083 --> 21:13.625
[grunting]

21:13.708 --> 21:16.667
[intense music]

21:16.750 --> 21:18.208
Uhh!

21:23.042 --> 21:25.083
Leave him
where they can find him.

21:25.167 --> 21:30.833
And tell the others...
we attack in six hours.

21:30.917 --> 21:32.708
And when we finish,
there must not be

21:32.792 --> 21:36.375
one Centauri left alive
on this station!

21:36.458 --> 21:37.750
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

21:42.333 --> 21:45.000
Death was caused by physical
trauma and loss of blood.

21:45.083 --> 21:47.042
One point of entry.

21:48.458 --> 21:51.458
7.5 centimeters
beneath the sternum.

21:51.542 --> 21:54.458
The weapon used in the murder
would appear to be an elongated

21:54.542 --> 21:57.625
blade, triangular signature,
10-12 inches in length.

21:57.708 --> 22:00.208
Is there any indication that
the Narns were responsible?

22:00.292 --> 22:02.375
Well, bruises
on the deceased's arms

22:02.458 --> 22:07.167
look like, pressure marks
from a five-fingered hand.

22:07.250 --> 22:09.875
'Fingernails are pointed
and left indentations'

22:09.958 --> 22:11.417
here, here and here.

22:11.500 --> 22:14.000
Curvature and spacing
would seem to indicate

22:14.083 --> 22:16.458
but not prove, Narn physiology.

22:16.542 --> 22:19.167
I'd better notify
Ambassador Mollari.

22:19.250 --> 22:20.333
Michael..

22:21.417 --> 22:23.875
I wouldn't.
This place is a powder keg.

22:23.958 --> 22:26.417
One more killing tied to
either side and it'll blow.

22:26.500 --> 22:27.833
Captain, with all due respect

22:27.917 --> 22:29.417
if we start withholding
information--

22:29.500 --> 22:32.292
What information? I know we
can't prove it was the Narns.

22:32.375 --> 22:35.583
Captain, come on.
You know it was.

22:35.667 --> 22:39.167
There's what we believe, and
then there's what we can prove.

22:39.250 --> 22:40.417
The time it takes to prove it

22:40.500 --> 22:42.292
will give me
some room to maneuver.

22:42.375 --> 22:45.458
And telling Londo now
won't bring this guy back.

22:45.542 --> 22:48.708
Not telling him for a while,
might save a lot of people

22:48.792 --> 22:50.875
from getting killed in a riot.

22:52.750 --> 22:53.917
Alright.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.208
[machine whirring]

22:59.125 --> 23:02.042
It's late, ambassador.
We're closing up.

23:03.125 --> 23:06.208
And you...you should go home.

23:08.542 --> 23:11.500
Oh, were you, um...
were you waiting for someone?

23:13.958 --> 23:15.208
Yes.

23:15.917 --> 23:17.167
Someone.

23:26.708 --> 23:29.167
[doorbell rings]
Yes. Come in.

23:34.375 --> 23:36.292
- Good morning, commander.
- Good morning.

23:36.375 --> 23:38.708
I thought we'd agreed
I'd meet you in the Zocalo.

23:40.583 --> 23:43.000
It occurred to me that you're
probably showin' me only the

23:43.083 --> 23:46.000
'good things about this place,
in an attempt to impress us.'

23:46.083 --> 23:49.000
'All perfectly understandable,
given the temptation of our'

23:49.083 --> 23:53.000
company, but it doesn't
tell us what you're really like.

23:53.083 --> 23:55.333
Well, there is such
a thing as privacy.

23:55.417 --> 23:57.667
I mean, if you're gonna stop by,
it'd be nice if you asked me

23:57.750 --> 24:01.292
or told me
when you're coming by.

24:01.375 --> 24:03.750
Hey! Like I said..

24:03.833 --> 24:04.917
...privacy!

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
But what is it?

24:07.083 --> 24:09.000
It's personal, and it's mine.

24:09.083 --> 24:12.000
And you two are gonna wait
outside until I'm ready.

24:12.083 --> 24:14.250
And if you're convinced that
I'm only showing the good parts

24:14.333 --> 24:16.333
of Babylon 5, well, then,
go ahead and choose any part

24:16.417 --> 24:18.833
of the station at random
and I'll take you there.

24:18.917 --> 24:20.208
Your choice.

24:21.292 --> 24:22.542
Agreed.

24:25.042 --> 24:26.625
"Whatever it takes," he says.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.125
Where's the rest of it?

24:31.208 --> 24:32.458
Hey!

24:42.667 --> 24:44.583
- Do you have many of these?
- Yeah.

24:46.625 --> 24:47.833
Excellent.

24:51.708 --> 24:54.292
I'm sorry, captain,
but we've reviewed your report

24:54.375 --> 24:57.042
on the Narn situation,
and we have to decline

24:57.125 --> 24:58.583
their request for intervention.

24:58.667 --> 25:01.083
We don't have to support
their military campaign

25:01.167 --> 25:03.250
just lend a hand to save
their civilian population

25:03.333 --> 25:04.750
when they get caught
in the middle.

25:04.833 --> 25:07.917
Captain, I know this isn't
what you wanted to hear

25:08.000 --> 25:10.083
but we simply can't
give the Narn government

25:10.167 --> 25:11.792
any kind of official help.

25:11.875 --> 25:14.125
I feel for them,
as much as you do.

25:14.208 --> 25:16.750
But their people will just
have to fend for themselves.

25:18.250 --> 25:19.333
[beeping]

25:21.625 --> 25:23.667
Link me in
with Ambassador Delenn.

25:23.750 --> 25:26.417
[automated]
'Stand by.'

25:26.500 --> 25:29.042
Ambassador G'Kar, I'm afraid
they didn't listen to you.

25:29.125 --> 25:30.542
A group of extremists
are planning

25:30.625 --> 25:32.250
to attack the Centauri here.

25:32.333 --> 25:33.750
Shruck! Are they armed?

25:33.833 --> 25:37.042
A few guns, mostly Drasi knives,
long ones with poisoned tips.

25:37.125 --> 25:38.458
- When?
- About two human hours.

25:38.542 --> 25:40.083
- Two!
- Shall I alert the captain?

25:40.167 --> 25:42.833
No! if he tries to stop them,
there will only be more violence

25:42.917 --> 25:45.458
or they'll wait a few
days and attack later.

25:45.542 --> 25:47.667
This has to be stopped
at the source.

25:47.750 --> 25:50.125
They've rejected my authority.
I have to reclaim it.

25:50.208 --> 25:52.125
- You don't mean you're going--
- Well, I have no choice.

25:52.208 --> 25:54.000
- Then I'm coming with you.
- I don't think that would be--

25:54.083 --> 25:55.875
You will need someone
to watch your back.

25:55.958 --> 25:58.375
If it's not me,
who would you prefer?

26:06.208 --> 26:08.417
When I said you could choose
anyplace you wanted to see

26:08.500 --> 26:11.708
I thought you'd pick command
and control or the Zocalo--

26:11.792 --> 26:14.333
Which is exactly
why we chose this.

26:14.417 --> 26:16.792
You say these are
your own species, yes?

26:16.875 --> 26:20.250
We call them Lurkers,
and, yes, humans, mostly.

26:20.333 --> 26:22.292
'They come to Babylon 5
in search of new lives'

26:22.375 --> 26:23.625
new opportunities.

26:23.708 --> 26:26.833
Sometimes it happens,
and sometimes it doesn't.

26:26.917 --> 26:28.500
When it doesn't,
quite of often they don't have

26:28.583 --> 26:30.458
enough money
for a return ticket.

26:30.542 --> 26:33.542
So they end up getting
small jobs here and there.

26:33.625 --> 26:35.208
When those go dry they end up

26:35.292 --> 26:39.125
moving into the undeveloped
parts of the station down below.

26:39.208 --> 26:40.833
Anyway, this is something you
shouldn't really be seeing.

26:40.917 --> 26:43.000
- Most impressive.
- Excuse me?

26:43.083 --> 26:45.500
We have isolated ourselves
from inferior species

26:45.583 --> 26:48.125
but you, you've shown
the will and the strength

26:48.208 --> 26:50.500
to isolate the genetically
inferior parts

26:50.583 --> 26:53.833
of your own species
as an evolutionary protection.

26:53.917 --> 26:56.208
I-I don't think you understand,
This was not intentional.

26:56.292 --> 26:57.750
You're too modest.
You're too modest.

26:57.833 --> 26:59.500
It's a brilliant move,
commander.

26:59.583 --> 27:02.167
You see, you-you
isolate the genetic pool

27:02.250 --> 27:05.167
you limit their chances
for procreation, you, you

27:05.250 --> 27:08.458
you create a work force without
a power base to challenge you.

27:08.542 --> 27:09.875
[laughing]
Well..

27:09.958 --> 27:11.333
This is not something
we thought of

27:11.417 --> 27:12.875
but someday we will institute it

27:12.958 --> 27:14.708
in our world
at the first opportunity.

27:14.792 --> 27:16.833
- Uh, but--
- You see, alliance--

27:16.917 --> 27:20.167
Alliances are built upon
more than tactical advantages.

27:20.250 --> 27:23.583
They are built upon
similarities of culture.

27:23.667 --> 27:26.292
And it would appear
that we are more similar

27:26.375 --> 27:28.208
than I had first suspected.

27:28.292 --> 27:30.000
Congratulations, commander.

27:30.083 --> 27:32.833
This more than anything
else has convinced me

27:32.917 --> 27:36.208
that you are worthy
of an alliance.

27:36.292 --> 27:39.875
We will go now and discuss
the terms of our alliance.

27:39.958 --> 27:43.167
Um, thank you,
but this is not, I..

27:43.250 --> 27:44.292
Oh, hell.

27:45.833 --> 27:47.917
We know where
the Centauri can be found.

27:48.000 --> 27:52.208
The casino, the Zocalo,
the night places

27:52.292 --> 27:55.542
for they are creatures
of the night. We will--

27:55.625 --> 27:56.958
You will do nothing!

27:58.458 --> 28:01.542
This is not your battle.
Go back to your human friends.

28:01.625 --> 28:03.042
You have no authority here.

28:03.125 --> 28:05.125
You cannot take
what you do not own!

28:05.208 --> 28:07.750
My authority comes
directly from the Kari.

28:07.833 --> 28:09.792
It can only be taken by force!

28:11.417 --> 28:13.208
Are you challenging me?

28:13.292 --> 28:15.458
You've already
made the challenge!

28:15.542 --> 28:19.833
The question is, do you have
the courage to back it up?

28:19.917 --> 28:22.958
[intense music]

28:24.333 --> 28:27.333
[grunting]

28:31.000 --> 28:32.083
Argh!

28:37.750 --> 28:40.792
[growling]

28:46.375 --> 28:49.417
[music continues]

28:51.375 --> 28:53.208
[growling continues]

29:05.542 --> 29:08.583
[grunting continues]

29:14.333 --> 29:15.500
Argh!

29:17.083 --> 29:18.583
Enough!

29:18.667 --> 29:19.750
This ends!

29:20.167 --> 29:21.292
Now!

29:22.500 --> 29:24.333
Go back to your quarters!

29:24.417 --> 29:25.833
If peace on this station

29:25.917 --> 29:28.667
is the only way
to win the war at home

29:28.750 --> 29:31.583
then peace we will give them!

29:32.667 --> 29:33.875
Go!

29:38.000 --> 29:40.042
[groaning]

29:44.750 --> 29:46.292
[grunting]

29:46.375 --> 29:48.667
- Uhh!
- 'Ambassador!'

29:48.750 --> 29:51.292
I'm alright,
it was a Drasi blade, poison

29:51.375 --> 29:52.833
but I think
I only caught a little.

29:52.917 --> 29:53.833
- I'll get help.
- No!

29:53.917 --> 29:56.583
I mustn't let them see weakness.

29:56.667 --> 29:58.750
Walk beside me, Na'Toth.

30:06.792 --> 30:09.833
On my way here,
I talked to Dr. Franklin.

30:09.917 --> 30:11.875
He thinks we can get
medical aid to the Narns

30:11.958 --> 30:14.042
earmarked for their
civilian population.

30:14.125 --> 30:17.250
Those we can't get out,
we'll try to help.

30:17.333 --> 30:19.375
Those we can't get out?

30:20.958 --> 30:23.625
I can't be more specific,
but from time to time

30:23.708 --> 30:29.375
he's been able to...get other
people out of sticky situations.

30:29.458 --> 30:32.250
Now, he's agreed
to use his contacts

30:32.333 --> 30:36.667
to help us get some of the Narn
civilians out of harm's way.

30:36.750 --> 30:38.833
But you realize this violates

30:38.917 --> 30:41.083
your government's
recommendation?

30:41.167 --> 30:43.917
They said they can't
give official help.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.917
And this is as
unofficial as you can get.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.458
If we do this right
there won't be

30:48.542 --> 30:51.333
any fingerprints
leading back here.

30:51.417 --> 30:53.500
But it is still a risk.

30:53.583 --> 30:56.292
Yes. I suppose.

30:56.375 --> 30:57.958
But, ambassador,
I've learned the hard way

30:58.042 --> 31:01.167
that governments deal in matters
of convenience not conscience.

31:01.250 --> 31:03.833
If they fall behind,
it is up to the rest of us

31:03.917 --> 31:05.875
to make up the difference.

31:05.958 --> 31:09.208
If we don't, who will?

31:09.292 --> 31:10.708
- Who indeed?
- Yeah.

31:13.625 --> 31:15.375
Anything else?

31:17.083 --> 31:19.292
I've made some inquiries.

31:19.375 --> 31:22.917
It turns out that we have
more food coming into Babylon 5

31:23.000 --> 31:24.417
than ever gets used.

31:24.500 --> 31:26.167
On the theory
that the Centauri don't want

31:26.250 --> 31:28.292
trouble with your government,
we could transfer

31:28.375 --> 31:32.667
some of that food...
to Minbari transports.

31:32.750 --> 31:36.125
They could deliver it to safe
zones in the Narn colonies and--

31:36.208 --> 31:38.125
And once the cargo is off-loaded

31:38.208 --> 31:40.792
the ships could bring back
as many Narns as can fit.

31:40.875 --> 31:42.875
Yes, that's the idea.

31:42.958 --> 31:45.208
I, uh, do not have

31:45.292 --> 31:48.625
the same resources
I once had, captain..

31:48.708 --> 31:53.333
...but what I have...
is at your disposal.

31:54.250 --> 31:55.542
Thank you.

31:58.667 --> 32:01.583
Since you've decided
to sign on with Babylon 5

32:01.667 --> 32:03.292
I'm sure the captain
won't mind us

32:03.375 --> 32:05.417
using his office
to conclude the deal.

32:06.583 --> 32:08.042
It's tea.

32:08.125 --> 32:10.750
I checked the biologs and it's
perfectly safe for you to drink.

32:12.167 --> 32:14.375
So you said that there were
a few details to work out

32:14.458 --> 32:15.875
prior to closing this deal?

32:16.500 --> 32:17.583
Yes.

32:21.250 --> 32:24.333
Tradition is important
to my culture.

32:24.417 --> 32:26.375
Our important agreements
are symbolic

32:26.458 --> 32:29.792
with coming together...
in perfect union.

32:29.875 --> 32:31.333
Well, this certainly qualifies.

32:31.417 --> 32:34.333
The captain felt very strongly
about making this deal happen.

32:34.417 --> 32:37.250
Then we will conclude this deal
in our traditional manner.

32:37.333 --> 32:39.917
We will have sex.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.375
Sex?

32:41.458 --> 32:44.333
It is necessary
to finalize the agreement.

32:44.417 --> 32:46.875
I-I certainly appreciate, but..

32:46.958 --> 32:48.875
...I have to get this.
Ivanova here.

32:48.958 --> 32:50.708
- Commander?
- What-what do you want?

32:50.792 --> 32:52.083
Oh, right. The Poc Marah deal.

32:52.167 --> 32:54.417
I s-forgot totally about it.
I'll be right there.

32:54.500 --> 32:57.292
I-I.. Very sorry, really
have to take care of this.

32:57.375 --> 33:00.042
Um, maybe we could just
put a pin in this right now.

33:00.125 --> 33:02.042
And, um, I'll get back to you
in a little bit.

33:02.125 --> 33:05.292
And then we can, um,
finalize this then.

33:06.875 --> 33:08.292
Of course.

33:16.083 --> 33:18.208
Ah, captain, there you are.

33:18.292 --> 33:19.875
Na'Toth here has
a little present for us

33:19.958 --> 33:21.750
courtesy of Ambassador G'Kar.

33:21.833 --> 33:24.083
This is the one
who killed the Centauri.

33:24.167 --> 33:25.417
You have witnesses?

33:25.500 --> 33:27.750
He'll confess
when he comes to trial.

33:27.833 --> 33:32.333
He's come to understand the
concepts of honor and obedience.

33:32.417 --> 33:33.792
Is this correct?

33:35.208 --> 33:36.250
Yes.

33:37.417 --> 33:39.417
Zach, stick him in a cell and

33:39.500 --> 33:41.125
take her statement
while you're at it.

33:41.208 --> 33:43.208
(Zach)
'You got it chief.'

33:43.292 --> 33:44.917
You know, Londo's going
to go right up the flue

33:45.000 --> 33:47.250
when he finds out that one of
his people was killed by a Narn.

33:47.333 --> 33:49.125
He'll announce it
all over the station as

33:49.208 --> 33:52.000
proof that the Narn
are barbarians.

33:52.083 --> 33:56.458
Hmm. The trial is gonna stir up
even more violence around here.

33:56.542 --> 33:58.500
Retribution, revenge.

33:58.583 --> 34:01.583
Could this situation
possibly get any uglier?

34:01.667 --> 34:03.500
(Susan)
This couldn't
possibly be any worse!

34:03.583 --> 34:05.292
"Do whatever you have to,"
he tells me.

34:05.375 --> 34:07.292
But nobody told me this involves
having sex with an alien.

34:07.375 --> 34:09.750
Well, he didn't know.
None of us did.

34:09.833 --> 34:11.458
We barely met
this species before now

34:11.542 --> 34:15.583
and who knew that they treat sex
the way we treat handshakes.

34:15.667 --> 34:17.000
Maybe you should
talk to the captain.

34:17.083 --> 34:18.875
I can't, I linked him
a note just before the meeting

34:18.958 --> 34:20.500
telling him that everything
was taken care of.

34:20.583 --> 34:23.125
I can't go back now and tell him
that it's all fallen apart.

34:23.208 --> 34:26.333
Oh, you could put a bag over his
head and do it for Babylon 5.

34:26.417 --> 34:28.958
[laughing]

34:29.042 --> 34:30.125
Maybe not.

34:30.208 --> 34:32.125
I'm doomed.

34:32.208 --> 34:35.750
Wha.. I could inject you
with something make you sick.

34:35.833 --> 34:37.125
'After all he doesn't know
a thing about'

34:37.208 --> 34:38.500
'anybody's biology
but his own.'

34:38.583 --> 34:40.250
- He-he'd probably fall for it.
- That's it!

34:40.333 --> 34:41.917
- I'll get a needle.
- No, no, no.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.208
I've decided, I'm gonna give
him, exactly what he wants.

34:45.292 --> 34:47.667
- I'll catch you later.
- Wha.. Hey..

34:50.667 --> 34:51.792
[doorbell rings]

34:51.875 --> 34:52.917
Enter.

34:54.917 --> 34:57.083
I just came back
from seeing the humans.

34:57.167 --> 34:58.667
Captain Sheridan
wants to see you

34:58.750 --> 35:01.167
and Ambassador Delenn
in private.

35:01.250 --> 35:03.000
Ah! There, you see.

35:03.083 --> 35:07.083
You work toward cooperation
and we get what we need

35:07.167 --> 35:08.875
by keeping it quiet. Ohh!

35:09.917 --> 35:11.458
Perhaps later. The poison's--

35:11.542 --> 35:13.875
I've treated the wound
and the poison.

35:13.958 --> 35:17.333
I'll be less than myself for
a few days, but I'll survive.

35:17.417 --> 35:19.958
This is important, I don't
want to keep them waiting

35:20.042 --> 35:23.208
not when we're finally
going to get what we want.

35:23.292 --> 35:25.250
Here he-help me get ready.

35:25.958 --> 35:27.333
Uhh!

35:27.417 --> 35:30.667
Leftover food
and medical supplies.

35:30.750 --> 35:33.917
Cargo holds to smuggle out
a few here and a few there.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.875
It's the best
we can do, ambassador.

35:35.958 --> 35:39.500
No ships, no cruisers, no
fighters to come in on our side.

35:39.583 --> 35:42.083
No mines, drones, weapons.

35:42.167 --> 35:46.000
We cannot enter this conflict
G'Kar, you know that.

35:46.083 --> 35:50.042
But we can help to save as
many of your people as we can.

35:50.125 --> 35:52.208
And I can't tell
anyone about it

35:52.292 --> 35:55.292
can't use this as
leverage on the others

35:55.375 --> 35:58.458
because if I talk about it,
the aid disappears.

35:58.542 --> 36:00.750
I'm afraid so.

36:00.833 --> 36:05.875
This has to be done on the q-t
G'Kar, but it is a start.

36:05.958 --> 36:08.792
I-I thought you'd be pleased.

36:08.875 --> 36:12.917
Yes, of course I am,
quite pleased.

36:13.000 --> 36:16.417
I understand the risk
you are both taking.

36:16.500 --> 36:19.208
I will honor your request.

36:19.292 --> 36:21.875
And I thank you
on behalf of the many Narns

36:21.958 --> 36:23.750
whose lives this will save.

36:25.250 --> 36:26.542
Thank you.

36:41.375 --> 36:44.167
[laughing]

37:04.000 --> 37:05.792
I thought it over.

37:05.875 --> 37:08.167
And I'm ready now.

37:08.250 --> 37:10.208
I set aside as much
time as required

37:10.292 --> 37:13.208
to have sex
as it's done by your species.

37:16.708 --> 37:19.667
Since, if we we were
to do it human-style

37:19.750 --> 37:21.292
probably be too much for you.

37:21.375 --> 37:24.333
Are you implying that
Lumati sex is inferior?

37:24.417 --> 37:27.292
Oh, no, no, not at all.

37:27.375 --> 37:29.458
Well, not as such.

37:29.542 --> 37:33.333
I mean It just wouldn't be fair
to ask you to do it our way

37:33.417 --> 37:37.625
on such short notice, you know,
the pressure to perform.

37:37.708 --> 37:39.458
Enough.

37:39.542 --> 37:43.208
To conclude our deal
we will have sex human-style.

37:44.958 --> 37:46.208
Hmm.

37:47.750 --> 37:49.333
You sure?

37:49.417 --> 37:51.000
You do know what this entails?

37:51.083 --> 37:55.042
Of course. Ignorance is
a-an inferior trait.

37:55.125 --> 37:56.417
That's what I thought.

37:57.667 --> 38:00.292
- You ready?
- Yes.

38:00.375 --> 38:01.292
Good.

38:01.375 --> 38:04.833
[breathes deeply]

Oh...God, you're good.

38:52.333 --> 38:54.042
- Oh.
- What do I do now?

38:55.167 --> 38:56.917
Old style,
you roll over and go to bed.

38:57.000 --> 39:00.083
New style, you go out for pizza
and I never see you again.

39:03.000 --> 39:06.750
Perhaps, I'll call you...
before I go.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.042
Whew!

39:18.500 --> 39:19.750
Toq!

39:22.000 --> 39:25.042
[laughing]

39:31.708 --> 39:33.417
(John)
'And I can understand'

39:33.500 --> 39:37.417
why you'd probably want this
Narn tried here on Babylon 5.

39:37.500 --> 39:38.625
Absolutely.

39:38.708 --> 39:40.125
The victim was
one of your people

39:40.208 --> 39:43.250
and as such,
it's nominally in your court.

39:43.333 --> 39:46.792
I just think the trial
should be delayed for, uh..

39:46.875 --> 39:48.458
...well, for as
long as possible.

39:48.542 --> 39:51.417
You know, keep a low profile.
No announcements, no press.

39:51.500 --> 39:52.958
(Londo)
'A Centauri was killed.'

39:53.042 --> 39:55.833
- You have a picture?
- Uh.

39:55.917 --> 39:59.250
I'm sure you can sympathize
with our situation, ambassador.

39:59.333 --> 40:02.292
I mean, this is a potentially
explosive situation

40:02.375 --> 40:05.375
and much as your first instinct
might be to go public with--

40:05.458 --> 40:07.083
Ah, I know this one.

40:08.208 --> 40:09.792
He was trouble.

40:09.875 --> 40:11.958
I always said things
would not end well for him

40:12.042 --> 40:13.958
and that it would be his fault.

40:14.042 --> 40:16.125
Yes, well, um, he did attack

40:16.208 --> 40:18.583
a group of Narns,
uh, provoked them.

40:18.667 --> 40:20.000
- As I thought.
- Hmm.

40:20.083 --> 40:21.708
He has no family back home.

40:21.792 --> 40:25.250
No one to miss him
or fight for his name.

40:25.333 --> 40:28.750
Well, I would expect
nothing less

40:28.833 --> 40:32.000
than the deportation
of the Narn in question.

40:32.083 --> 40:34.375
'His personal effects
will be confiscated'

40:34.458 --> 40:37.083
auctioned,
and the proceeds donated

40:37.167 --> 40:40.000
to the Centauri war fund.

40:40.083 --> 40:42.792
That irony is all
the justice I require.

40:44.042 --> 40:46.167
'Is there anything else?'

40:46.250 --> 40:47.667
No, I don't think so.

40:47.750 --> 40:49.375
Well, then I shall be going.

40:53.333 --> 40:56.333
Good day, to the both of you.

41:10.917 --> 41:12.333
- Commander.
- Oh, captain.

41:12.417 --> 41:14.125
I was about to go
looking for you.

41:14.208 --> 41:16.167
I heard the good news
about Londo. Congratulations.

41:16.250 --> 41:17.375
Well, and to you, too.

41:17.458 --> 41:18.958
The Lumati sent word to Earth

41:19.042 --> 41:20.875
confirming their interest
in working with us

41:20.958 --> 41:23.875
and said some very
complimentary things about you.

41:23.958 --> 41:25.792
Which reminds me

41:25.875 --> 41:28.708
the head Lumati left this
for you before he took off.

41:28.792 --> 41:31.417
- Well, isn't that sweet.
- Mm-hmm.

41:34.417 --> 41:37.792
- 'What's it say?'
- "Next time, my way."

41:45.750 --> 41:48.042
Commander, is there something
you'd like to tell me?

41:50.208 --> 41:51.250
[sighs]

42:05.250 --> 42:07.750
Thanks...for what you did.

42:08.875 --> 42:10.958
Well, it would not
bring him back..

42:12.000 --> 42:13.500
...and he was trouble.

42:14.500 --> 42:17.333
The Narns are falling before us.

42:17.417 --> 42:21.167
Soon they will have all
the trouble they could wish for.

42:21.250 --> 42:22.958
What else does one need?

42:23.833 --> 42:25.292
And if it makes your life

42:25.375 --> 42:28.625
a little easier
in this difficult time..

42:28.708 --> 42:30.958
...it is a happy coincidence.

42:35.792 --> 42:39.000
It is good to have friends,
is it not, Mr. Garibaldi?

42:40.542 --> 42:44.500
Even if maybe...
only for a little while.

42:47.500 --> 42:49.375
Even if only
for a little while.

43:02.500 --> 43:04.375
