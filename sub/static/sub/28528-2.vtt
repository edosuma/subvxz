02:03.155 --> 02:05.158
Princess of Wales.

02:06.078 --> 02:08.080
Does it scare you?

02:15.008 --> 02:19.893
I asked my mother once why I
was not afraid of my destiny.

02:22.656 --> 02:25.819
She said I may as well be
fearful of my own reflection.

02:27.501 --> 02:30.142
<i>There is no fear.</i>

02:30.144 --> 02:31.984
Our marriage has brought peace.

02:31.986 --> 02:34.867
In the south, yes,
but Scotland...

02:34.869 --> 02:36.428
They raid
across the borders.

02:36.430 --> 02:41.394
They kill and rob your people,
rich and poor alike.

02:41.396 --> 02:43.398
Butcher them.

02:44.679 --> 02:48.641
Heh. My father has a
worse punishment in store.

02:48.643 --> 02:51.084
He'll probably send my
brother Harry to them,

02:51.086 --> 02:54.770
hitch him up to some
Morag or Mordina.

03:37.975 --> 03:39.935
Ow!

03:39.937 --> 03:41.657
I-I'm sorry.

03:41.659 --> 03:43.178
Did I hurt you?

03:43.180 --> 03:47.623
Uh, c-calm.
Calm, Arthur.

03:47.625 --> 03:49.627
I am calm.

03:54.192 --> 03:57.355
I may touch you?

04:17.016 --> 04:19.017
Do I not please?

04:20.420 --> 04:24.824
I cannot be rushed,
like some horse to stud.

04:27.907 --> 04:29.910
We should sleep.

04:35.475 --> 04:37.477
As you wish, my lord.

05:09.071 --> 05:12.392
<i>I'm glad you wanted
to kiss my neck.</i>

05:25.047 --> 05:29.770
You talk in your sleep,
in Spanish.

05:29.772 --> 05:32.413
That's a pity.

05:32.415 --> 05:34.658
I wish to dream
in English.

05:39.383 --> 05:41.385
You should have woken me.

05:42.426 --> 05:44.186
The banquet today

05:44.188 --> 05:47.029
<i>is for the toast
of Gaunt.</i>

05:47.031 --> 05:50.955
My father's idea,
celebrate our bloodline.

05:52.797 --> 05:54.799
<i>I warn you...</i>

05:55.880 --> 05:58.120
we'll be
required to dance.

05:58.122 --> 06:00.605
I could teach you
the <i>pavane.</i>

06:02.046 --> 06:04.048
Must be English.

06:19.184 --> 06:20.944
Some person from
their consulate...

06:20.946 --> 06:21.945
Ah.

06:21.947 --> 06:23.227
he came and told me

06:23.229 --> 06:26.470
I should meet
a Duke of "Rot-es-char."

06:26.472 --> 06:27.511
Rotes...

06:27.513 --> 06:29.033
"Rot-es-char."

06:29.035 --> 06:30.034
...char.

06:30.036 --> 06:31.475
Ah. He has lands.

06:31.477 --> 06:33.077
They all have lands.

06:33.079 --> 06:34.919
"I have
some countryside here

06:34.921 --> 06:36.400
and some countryside
over there."

06:36.402 --> 06:38.725
Ah, but they do
not all have wives.

06:43.049 --> 06:45.130
<i>Uh, good morning, brother.</i>

06:45.132 --> 06:46.611
<i>Sunt tibi bene,</i>

06:46.613 --> 06:48.653
<i>uh, as the old
Benedictines say?</i>

06:50.938 --> 06:53.498
Well, but can you
have a good night

06:53.500 --> 06:56.261
if you're a celibate monk?

06:56.263 --> 06:58.223
On your way,
little brother.

06:58.225 --> 07:02.868
I'm just concerned
that she was too much for you.

07:07.675 --> 07:10.516
What did Socrates say?

07:10.518 --> 07:15.403
When... When men who are fond of
spirited horses master those beasts,

07:16.244 --> 07:19.726
they find the rest of life
easy to cope with.

07:19.728 --> 07:24.693
And did you master
your Iberian thoroughbred?

07:27.096 --> 07:30.737
Gentlemen, last night,

07:30.739 --> 07:32.099
I was in Spain.

07:32.101 --> 07:34.341
Yes. Yeah.

07:38.347 --> 07:40.350
<i>Rosa.</i>

07:41.911 --> 07:44.312
I will need a fresh fire
in this room.

07:44.314 --> 07:46.316
<i>Last night's
burned so fiercely.</i>

07:47.917 --> 07:49.920
There was much to burn.

08:12.623 --> 08:14.626
Fetch me
more oil of rosemary.

08:17.348 --> 08:19.431
Yes, highness.

08:32.244 --> 08:34.164
Good day again,
exotic maid.

08:34.166 --> 08:37.967
I am on business
for the Infanta.

08:37.970 --> 08:39.770
Our lady,
the king's mother,

08:39.772 --> 08:44.255
has issued a decree that eligible
noblemen, such as myself,

08:44.256 --> 08:47.058
should be introduced
to the Infanta's ladies.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.901
Uh, Her Highness
chooses me my husband.

08:49.903 --> 08:54.545
No. Your matchmaker is Lady
Margaret, the king's mother.

08:54.547 --> 08:56.708
No one marries in this court
without her sanction.

08:56.710 --> 08:58.950
The Infanta's ladies will be
married to high-ranking Tudor men

08:58.952 --> 09:01.072
so she's certain
of your loyalty,

09:01.074 --> 09:04.318
or else you will be
tossed out from court.

09:06.400 --> 09:11.043
I will choose my husband,
alas, my lord,

09:11.045 --> 09:15.087
from men, not boys.

09:15.089 --> 09:17.211
Uh...

09:25.740 --> 09:28.621
<i>Be sure Arthur manages
the tenant lands.</i>

09:28.623 --> 09:31.504
Ludlow Castle is
his formal seat now,

09:31.506 --> 09:34.708
and its estates are the
responsibility of the Prince of Wales.

09:34.710 --> 09:37.072
Of course.
We leave tomorrow.

09:41.237 --> 09:45.679
I notice you avoid
the princess Catherine.

09:45.681 --> 09:47.683
Why is that?

09:48.284 --> 09:51.447
I-I do not, my lady.

09:52.969 --> 09:55.690
I expect you or Sir Richard
at court regularly

09:55.692 --> 09:57.892
to report back on the
prince and princess

09:57.894 --> 10:00.014
and how they fare
in Ludlow.

10:00.016 --> 10:01.736
I imagine, my lady,

10:01.738 --> 10:04.581
the king's mother has her own
methods of observing them.

10:06.143 --> 10:09.024
The girl has a simple job
to do... conceive.

10:09.026 --> 10:12.748
<i>See to it that all elements of
the house are conducive to it,</i>

10:12.750 --> 10:16.311
and waste no time in
sending news when she does.

10:16.313 --> 10:18.193
We can shame the Spanish
into sending

10:18.195 --> 10:19.835
the rest of the dowry
once the prince...

10:19.837 --> 10:22.200
Once the child
is with child.

10:25.483 --> 10:28.046
Oh, and I do observe,
Lady Pole...

10:29.367 --> 10:32.368
<i>comings and goings,
whispers in corridors.</i>

10:32.370 --> 10:35.171
Do you whisper
in corridors?

10:35.173 --> 10:38.176
What would I possibly have
to whisper about?

10:49.588 --> 10:51.308
Our newlyweds
look refreshed,

10:51.310 --> 10:52.910
don't you think?

10:52.912 --> 10:55.713
<i>Well, reasonably.</i>

10:55.715 --> 10:59.118
They are working hard
for England.

11:01.721 --> 11:05.043
<i>We are gathered
here today to celebrate</i>

11:05.045 --> 11:07.365
<i>the first day of the union</i>

11:07.367 --> 11:12.172
<i>between the crown of England
and the kingdom of Spain.</i>

11:13.093 --> 11:15.293
When we look upon
these two young people,

11:15.295 --> 11:17.696
<i>we look upon
the future of the throne</i>

11:17.698 --> 11:20.859
and to their heirs.

11:27.869 --> 11:31.152
Arthur, Catherine...

11:34.075 --> 11:35.835
you are both descendants

11:35.837 --> 11:40.642
of the first Duke of Lancaster,
John of Gaunt.

11:41.603 --> 11:46.208
England and Spain
united in you.

12:21.605 --> 12:24.328
The Scots
are almost here, Your Grace.

12:36.821 --> 12:39.502
If the wind changes and
you're still staring,

12:39.504 --> 12:41.506
you'll be stuck
like that forever.

12:42.587 --> 12:45.628
<i>Poor thing,
climbing under the sheets</i>

12:45.630 --> 12:48.031
with my cadaverous brother.

12:48.033 --> 12:51.234
What do you say,
Chaplain Woolsey?

12:51.236 --> 12:55.801
Oh, Harry, you've changed
little since your school days.

12:59.965 --> 13:04.290
Is it this light, or does she
look especially ordinary today?

13:27.434 --> 13:29.074
I don't know this.

13:29.076 --> 13:31.078
It's a galliard.

13:39.246 --> 13:41.046
A long, long road
to this day,

13:41.048 --> 13:43.449
but it is here,
by God's will.

13:43.451 --> 13:46.895
And by the king's will,
Your Grace, and by yours.

13:48.977 --> 13:51.898
Is every word you say
a rebuke to me, Maggie?

13:51.900 --> 13:54.861
Is every word
you say to me a threat?

13:54.863 --> 13:57.944
I know nothing about these plots
against England you imagine.

13:57.946 --> 13:59.948
I don't know it.

14:00.829 --> 14:02.831
Your Grace.

14:04.393 --> 14:05.993
It's like a <i>pavane,</i>

14:05.995 --> 14:08.677
same path,
same <i>pas ensemble.</i>

14:37.908 --> 14:39.910
<i>Lady Pole.</i>

14:41.151 --> 14:43.154
Lady Pole.

14:55.166 --> 14:59.210
I beg forgiveness for
what was done in my name.

15:00.892 --> 15:04.494
<i>I throw myself
upon your mercy.</i>

15:04.496 --> 15:06.498
<i>I did not know.</i>

15:08.220 --> 15:11.343
I-I cannot speak of it.

15:13.145 --> 15:15.147
Get up.

15:20.993 --> 15:22.633
I am here,
only because

15:22.635 --> 15:26.317
an innocent life
was taken, your brother.

15:26.319 --> 15:28.321
<i>Edward was innocent.</i>

15:36.089 --> 15:38.812
I was a child, too,
when it happened.

15:40.614 --> 15:45.499
I am so sorry,
so sorry.

16:05.680 --> 16:07.682
- Hey, hey.
- Oh!

16:16.772 --> 16:18.131
Ah! Hey, hey!

16:44.241 --> 16:46.081
Leave her alone, brother.
You're drunk.

16:52.650 --> 16:54.449
- <i>It's the Scots!</i>
- <i>Aye.</i>

16:57.455 --> 16:59.575
You disgusting heathens.

16:59.577 --> 17:03.139
You dare to foul
this day?

17:03.141 --> 17:05.863
Your Highness,
these men are guests.

17:08.586 --> 17:13.391
Welcome, gentlemen.
Welcome.

17:14.913 --> 17:16.512
Now, as you recall from...

17:16.515 --> 17:19.796
It's... Come on.

17:19.798 --> 17:22.241
Why are they
looking at me?

17:46.226 --> 17:48.266
Where did you learn
the vihuela?

17:48.268 --> 17:52.270
Many people taught me...

17:52.272 --> 17:54.274
many things.

18:07.849 --> 18:11.012
<i>Mi príncipe.
Mi príncipe.</i>

18:14.295 --> 18:16.378
Do you love me?

18:18.980 --> 18:20.982
I love you.

18:21.783 --> 18:23.785
I love you.

18:28.550 --> 18:30.190
Have courage, child.

18:30.192 --> 18:32.713
<i>...and I can
assure you that she is.</i>

18:32.715 --> 18:36.679
<i>Aye.
Then it's agreed, Your Grace.</i>

18:42.525 --> 18:44.005
I'll dispatch a message
to Edinburgh.

18:44.007 --> 18:47.010
To let the king know
we have a treaty.

18:48.251 --> 18:52.013
Then she'll suit him?

18:52.015 --> 18:53.655
<i>She's young.</i>

18:53.657 --> 18:56.179
That suits him well.

18:57.861 --> 19:01.062
<i>Meg, you know these...
gentlemen.</i>

19:01.064 --> 19:03.467
<i>They've ridden
from King James.</i>

19:05.229 --> 19:07.109
Scottish thugs, Father,

19:07.111 --> 19:11.113
men who raid our land
and kill our people.

19:11.115 --> 19:14.757
William Dunbar is the most
celebrated poet in Scotland.

19:14.759 --> 19:19.322
And an eloquent
ambassador.

19:19.324 --> 19:21.444
King James and I
have brokered peace

19:21.446 --> 19:22.805
between
our two countries

19:22.807 --> 19:25.849
that will put an end
to our grievances,

19:25.851 --> 19:29.614
a peace that will be sealed
with your marriage.

19:33.659 --> 19:35.701
Just like that?

19:38.664 --> 19:41.305
Like that.

19:41.307 --> 19:43.107
Our
countries have been at war

19:43.109 --> 19:45.269
for two centuries, girl.

19:45.271 --> 19:47.311
You knew that one day

19:47.313 --> 19:49.836
a husband would be
chosen for you.

20:03.050 --> 20:07.054
A gift of goodwill.

20:15.543 --> 20:17.823
Uh...

20:17.825 --> 20:18.984
<i>Wait!</i>

20:18.986 --> 20:21.187
A wild girl
for a wild country.

20:21.189 --> 20:25.151
Meg, this treaty
with Scotland

20:25.153 --> 20:28.154
turns the sword
into a wedding band.

20:28.156 --> 20:30.837
You throw my body to them

20:30.839 --> 20:33.321
for their old king
to pounce on.

20:37.245 --> 20:39.928
Catherine would kill them
with her bare hands.

20:41.890 --> 20:43.892
<i>You did not
enjoy the day, did you?</i>

20:45.654 --> 20:47.735
Was it Harry?

20:47.737 --> 20:51.819
I did not ask your brother
to write to me...

20:51.821 --> 20:54.742
nor did I know it was him
when I replied.

20:54.744 --> 20:57.144
I feel foolish enough
that I was tricked.

20:57.146 --> 21:00.148
Can we not just put it
behind us, Arthur?

21:00.150 --> 21:02.152
The letters
are now ashes.

21:05.075 --> 21:09.960
I understand now what it
took for us to marry.

21:11.081 --> 21:15.043
Your cousin, Edward of
Warwick, was executed.

21:15.045 --> 21:16.204
Don't talk about that.

21:16.206 --> 21:17.806
<i>To clear the path for us.</i>

21:17.808 --> 21:19.168
On your own mother's
command.

21:19.170 --> 21:21.770
You blame my mother
for this?

21:21.772 --> 21:23.774
Blame your own.

21:28.379 --> 21:30.381
Is that why
you can't touch me?

21:38.990 --> 21:41.271
When we reach Ludlow,

21:41.273 --> 21:44.834
you will learn
to perform your duty.

21:44.836 --> 21:48.400
I am trying to perform
my duty now, Arthur.

21:50.082 --> 21:52.084
You won't let me.

21:54.326 --> 21:57.928
I will sleep alone
tonight.

21:57.930 --> 22:01.614
Should I warn my ladies this is
what it is to be a Tudor wife?

22:03.376 --> 22:08.141
The cold and the damp shrink
all desire and all joy.

22:10.223 --> 22:12.463
<i>I have seen things
that you,</i>

22:12.465 --> 22:14.906
hidden away in your
dark little country,

22:14.908 --> 22:16.910
could never dream of.

22:18.071 --> 22:22.316
I am the daughter of the two greatest
monarchs this world has ever known.

22:24.598 --> 22:26.600
If you challenge me...

22:27.882 --> 22:30.442
I shall defeat you.

22:34.449 --> 22:37.532
Perhaps you already
have, Catherine.

22:52.267 --> 22:54.269
Meg.

22:55.270 --> 22:58.472
I am ordered to see you
off and wish you well,

22:58.474 --> 23:01.996
but I wish they'd ordered
me to come with you.

23:01.998 --> 23:04.678
Still, they say
the sweat is back.

23:04.680 --> 23:06.961
Maybe I'll be lucky
and drop dead.

23:06.963 --> 23:10.565
Meg, let us say
goodbye properly.

23:10.567 --> 23:12.727
We are sisters now.

23:12.729 --> 23:17.614
So strange. You knew about your
wedding since you were a girl.

23:21.979 --> 23:26.301
My mother told me stories of
England since I was this high.

23:26.303 --> 23:30.305
Now, I thought at first
they were child's tales,

23:30.307 --> 23:32.107
but she was
turning the soil,

23:32.109 --> 23:34.590
and planting this country
in my heart.

23:34.592 --> 23:37.913
Now, even though it
is strange and new,

23:37.915 --> 23:40.556
it still feels
like mine.

23:40.558 --> 23:42.438
It was
my mother's gift.

23:42.440 --> 23:44.760
It was
a gift I wanted.

23:44.762 --> 23:47.966
And you never doubt?

23:49.527 --> 23:51.047
Whatever awaits you
in this life,

23:51.049 --> 23:55.051
you must <i>fijar...</i>

23:55.053 --> 23:57.013
fix your place
in the heavens.

23:57.015 --> 24:01.900
And what if you don't want the
place that others pick for you?

24:02.261 --> 24:07.026
Then pick your place,
not theirs, sister.

24:21.881 --> 24:25.563
That rose petal gets to be
the King of England,

24:25.565 --> 24:29.167
and dull-eyed Meg gets to be
the Queen of Scotland.

24:29.169 --> 24:33.371
My darling, you have
the heart of a lion

24:33.373 --> 24:35.974
and the soul of a poet.

24:35.976 --> 24:39.458
God has gifted you
a thousandfold.

24:39.460 --> 24:41.462
He has
great plans for you.

24:46.988 --> 24:50.990
Ah, Meg, are the Scots
to your liking?

24:50.992 --> 24:53.793
Have you learned
to "toss the caber"?

24:53.795 --> 24:56.396
<i>Ignore him, Meg.</i>

24:56.398 --> 24:59.040
Give those Scots
merry English hell.

25:00.682 --> 25:03.643
What do we do in Ludlow?

25:03.645 --> 25:07.007
Uh, there is no better way
to learn how to rule a country

25:07.009 --> 25:09.730
than by ruling
a principality first.

25:09.732 --> 25:11.932
My lady,
the king's mother

25:11.934 --> 25:15.856
has given many instructions
to keep your days filled.

25:15.858 --> 25:19.580
Your nights, of course,
you can fill as you choose.

25:19.582 --> 25:21.622
Board games, perhaps,

25:21.624 --> 25:25.226
though not solitaire.

25:28.672 --> 25:31.713
What did you tell him?

26:41.788 --> 26:44.709
If just one of my
childhood stories had made mention

26:44.711 --> 26:46.872
of this
awful English light...

26:46.874 --> 26:48.553
Then let us change it,

26:48.555 --> 26:51.477
and maybe it will lighten
the prince's heart.

27:01.529 --> 27:03.531
Who's winning?

27:04.532 --> 27:05.651
The tree.

27:14.863 --> 27:16.783
I have realized
something.

27:16.785 --> 27:18.905
I have seen
a portrait of her,

27:18.907 --> 27:21.350
but she never saw
a picture of me.

27:22.591 --> 27:27.314
You are
the sweetest of men.

27:27.316 --> 27:29.757
Hmm?

27:29.759 --> 27:34.362
You... You used to do that
to us as children.

27:34.364 --> 27:37.165
No, it wasn't me.

27:37.167 --> 27:39.169
Teddy used to do it.

27:42.172 --> 27:44.174
Oh, it's all right.

27:46.777 --> 27:49.497
I've had my own struggle
with Catherine,

27:49.499 --> 27:53.862
but then I thought
she must be spinning

27:53.864 --> 27:57.466
like a top in her mind
also, yes?

27:57.468 --> 28:01.550
She just hides
her fear better.

28:01.552 --> 28:04.553
Besides, I think
Teddy likes her.

28:04.555 --> 28:06.435
What do you mean?

28:06.437 --> 28:08.880
Oh, he's never far away.

28:11.723 --> 28:15.885
If he were here, we'd all be
playing fox and geese together.

28:20.973 --> 28:22.975
Oh, Arthur.

28:27.139 --> 28:32.024
Aunt Maggie, my mother
asked me to spy on you.

28:35.508 --> 28:38.068
Of course she did.

28:38.070 --> 28:39.510
Your mother
and the king

28:39.512 --> 28:43.356
see plots abroad
and plots at court.

28:44.758 --> 28:48.321
But we out here have
a chance to be happy.

29:05.980 --> 29:08.220
I should take confession.

29:08.222 --> 29:10.663
Too much like a church?

29:10.665 --> 29:14.188
Please, come here.

29:28.483 --> 29:32.448
You are afraid,
because you do not know me.

29:33.889 --> 29:37.211
I want you to understand
what I am.

29:37.213 --> 29:38.492
I am your wife,

29:38.494 --> 29:41.695
yes, but I am
also Infanta of Spain.

29:41.697 --> 29:42.736
I know that.

29:42.738 --> 29:45.219
But you do not know.

29:45.221 --> 29:47.902
I grew up
in a Christian court.

29:47.904 --> 29:49.103
We are Catholics,

29:49.105 --> 29:52.148
and we made all
of Spain Catholic.

29:53.550 --> 29:58.153
And yet there is
another side to us...

29:58.155 --> 30:02.037
not in faith,
not in culture.

30:02.039 --> 30:05.320
We eat at low tables.

30:05.322 --> 30:07.843
We say grace,
but we live in rooms

30:07.845 --> 30:10.448
studded with jewels...

30:11.769 --> 30:15.531
of al-Andalus
and Ethiopia.

30:15.533 --> 30:17.453
I believe in the one
true Catholic faith,

30:17.455 --> 30:20.018
but I respect
the beauty of Islam.

30:22.060 --> 30:25.463
I want you to know
these two sides of me.

30:26.865 --> 30:30.346
Tell me more
about your home.

30:30.348 --> 30:32.351
The Alhambra?

30:34.953 --> 30:37.594
When you enter
the first room,

30:37.596 --> 30:40.157
it is small...

30:40.159 --> 30:41.158
like a merchant's house.

30:41.160 --> 30:42.439
I was told it was grand.

30:42.441 --> 30:44.443
Wait.

30:45.124 --> 30:46.684
<i>But then you pass
through the first room,</i>

30:46.686 --> 30:48.968
<i>and you enter
the Golden Chamber.</i>

30:50.690 --> 30:53.291
<i>When I was a girl,</i>

30:53.293 --> 30:57.217
<i>the Golden Chamber
seemed as big as the sky.</i>

31:01.581 --> 31:05.385
I cannot remember a time
I was not betrothed to you.

31:06.106 --> 31:08.108
We were both
small children then,

31:09.710 --> 31:12.310
and now look at us.

31:12.312 --> 31:14.315
Look at us, Arthur.

31:15.836 --> 31:18.559
We are masters
of our destiny now.

31:20.481 --> 31:22.483
And we have time...

31:23.244 --> 31:26.726
to know each other
in all ways.

33:20.327 --> 33:23.809
"I will never boast,
but cherish humility instead.

33:23.811 --> 33:26.251
"I will speak the truth
at all times,

33:26.253 --> 33:27.933
"and forever keep my word.

33:27.935 --> 33:30.536
"I will defend those
who cannot defend themselves.

33:30.538 --> 33:32.540
"I will honor
and respect women.

33:33.341 --> 33:36.464
"I will be faithful in love
and loyal in friendship.

33:37.785 --> 33:42.268
I will be generous to the poor
and to those who need help."

33:42.270 --> 33:44.310
King Arthur?

33:44.312 --> 33:46.953
Which makes you Guinevere

33:46.955 --> 33:49.195
and Westminster Camelot.

33:49.197 --> 33:52.038
Why not?

33:52.040 --> 33:53.560
Who would stop us?

33:53.562 --> 33:55.081
<i>Una mesa redonda?</i>
The Round Table?

33:55.083 --> 33:58.285
And we'll make Stafford
and Wiltshire and Suffolk,

33:58.287 --> 34:00.087
make them
all sit around it.

34:00.089 --> 34:01.608
No more plots and secrets.

34:01.610 --> 34:03.612
Fair taxation.

34:05.775 --> 34:10.179
Something to work for,
then, together.

34:43.293 --> 34:45.295
Hyah!

35:12.885 --> 35:14.245
Lady grandmother.

35:14.247 --> 35:17.248
Look at this.
It's a thing of beauty.

35:17.250 --> 35:20.932
It's a page from my own translation
of <i>De Imitatione Christi,</i>

35:20.934 --> 35:24.816
printed by Caxton
on his press for me.

35:24.818 --> 35:27.298
<i>I supported him when he
began his labors.</i>

35:27.300 --> 35:30.782
Lady grandmother,
my father is making a mistake.

35:30.784 --> 35:34.466
What kind of men
serve this King James?

35:34.468 --> 35:38.790
They have been here for months,
and they are drunk all the time.

35:38.792 --> 35:40.352
Oh, Meg.

35:40.354 --> 35:43.916
Do you know why
this is beautiful to me?

35:43.918 --> 35:48.240
It is the mind
settled on a page.

35:48.242 --> 35:51.764
A life settled can be
just as beautiful.

35:51.766 --> 35:54.767
You should be grateful
that your life is settled.

35:54.769 --> 35:56.289
Many would want it.

35:56.291 --> 35:59.893
They leer at the married
ladies of the palace.

35:59.895 --> 36:02.295
They even touch them.

36:02.297 --> 36:05.138
They call me
"little fishy,"

36:05.140 --> 36:08.782
their king's little fishy
who has been caught.

36:08.784 --> 36:11.184
Is this dignified
for our family?

36:11.186 --> 36:13.347
One of them relieved himself
against the Royal Chapel.

36:13.349 --> 36:16.110
The king prays
in there every day.

36:16.112 --> 36:18.832
<i>Is this what they
think of us,</i>

36:18.834 --> 36:22.156
that our palace is nothing
but a street market?

36:22.158 --> 36:25.840
Would King Henry of England
send his daughter to such men?

36:25.842 --> 36:27.321
For peace, yes.

36:27.323 --> 36:28.563
And you pay these brutes

36:28.565 --> 36:30.204
huge sums of money
to take me away.

36:30.206 --> 36:31.966
That is
no concern of yours.

36:31.968 --> 36:33.808
King James is old.

36:33.810 --> 36:35.330
Not that old.

36:35.332 --> 36:37.092
He's old, and he'll die,

36:37.094 --> 36:40.455
next winter,
if it is harsh.

36:40.457 --> 36:43.458
And who will take
his place?

36:43.460 --> 36:48.025
Someone who wants peace
or good old war?

36:56.554 --> 36:58.434
My daughter bleats.

36:58.436 --> 37:01.037
It may sound like reason,
but trust me,

37:01.039 --> 37:02.598
it is simply bleating.

37:02.600 --> 37:04.240
And yet I find myself
wondering why we're

37:04.242 --> 37:07.003
paying out 100,000
crowns to King James

37:07.005 --> 37:08.605
when he might
be dead in a year.

37:08.607 --> 37:10.166
For the treaty.

37:10.168 --> 37:12.569
But we can't pay
the dowry on Meg

37:12.571 --> 37:14.851
if the Spanish don't
pay us for Catherine.

37:14.853 --> 37:16.012
We can't afford it.

37:16.014 --> 37:19.256
Spain will pay
as they promised.

37:19.258 --> 37:21.618
<i>Well, then let us
cancel the wedding</i>

37:21.620 --> 37:23.781
<i>and hold on to Meg
until they do.</i>

37:23.783 --> 37:28.265
Thomas. Your thoughts?

37:28.267 --> 37:31.028
Forgive me for saying
it, Your Grace,

37:31.030 --> 37:33.191
but no Spanish money
is forthcoming,

37:33.193 --> 37:36.954
<i>so perhaps we
should change course.</i>

37:36.956 --> 37:38.516
The Scots wouldn't
make war with us

37:38.518 --> 37:40.921
now that Isabella
is our ally.

37:42.202 --> 37:45.644
The treasury
is empty, Henry.

37:45.646 --> 37:49.129
The Scottish peace will hold
without an expensive wedding.

37:50.611 --> 37:52.613
It has to.

37:55.536 --> 37:57.738
At least, for now.

38:16.918 --> 38:18.638
What is this?

38:18.640 --> 38:20.440
It's not very...

38:20.442 --> 38:23.043
I've read the poets
and Aquinas,

38:23.045 --> 38:25.928
but I do not possess
their abilities.

38:29.692 --> 38:34.455
It is very fine, Arthur.

38:34.457 --> 38:36.859
But not as fine
as others can achieve.

38:38.261 --> 38:41.144
Others have not
achieved my hand.

38:45.789 --> 38:50.271
They walk, play games,

38:50.273 --> 38:53.074
and they're always...

38:53.076 --> 38:54.956
Ah, come on.

38:54.958 --> 38:57.159
But this means
that I dare not...

38:57.161 --> 38:59.163
Have they found love?

39:01.165 --> 39:04.366
They have found something.

39:04.368 --> 39:05.888
So have I.

39:05.890 --> 39:08.170
You found ruin,

39:08.172 --> 39:10.333
but now it must be over.

39:10.335 --> 39:12.975
Eh? I am <i>gitana.</i>

39:12.977 --> 39:15.698
Once we came from
the east, and then...

39:15.700 --> 39:17.900
A gypsy, I know.

39:17.902 --> 39:19.943
And we marry for love,

39:19.945 --> 39:24.147
and, um, they say
on English is...

39:24.149 --> 39:25.308
Desire.

39:25.310 --> 39:28.191
And we marry
for love and desire.

39:28.193 --> 39:30.634
But here,

39:30.636 --> 39:35.399
we marry for our future
and our safety.

39:35.401 --> 39:38.923
We came here
to be ladies of the court.

39:38.925 --> 39:40.965
We must marry into Tudor,

39:40.967 --> 39:44.168
or we will be sent
straight back to Spain.

39:44.170 --> 39:46.210
It's true.

39:46.212 --> 39:48.332
We may not pick
just who we wish.

39:48.334 --> 39:50.655
He must be Tudor.

39:50.657 --> 39:53.418
So you will marry
Charlie "Barandon"?

39:54.541 --> 39:57.782
No, not him. Someone else.

39:57.784 --> 40:01.348
And first you will take
your ruin with the bowman?

40:05.072 --> 40:07.432
Of course I won't.

40:07.434 --> 40:10.356
Don't say such things.

40:10.358 --> 40:15.161
But you must stop
your whoring.

40:15.163 --> 40:17.283
Don't say it
like that, Lina.

40:17.285 --> 40:19.805
You will stop your games
with Lord Stafford,

40:19.807 --> 40:22.729
or you will not find
a Tudor man to take you.

40:22.731 --> 40:26.613
I will not see him,
on my family honor.

40:26.615 --> 40:30.176
I will not.

40:30.178 --> 40:33.620
Uh, you are sick.

40:33.622 --> 40:35.984
I am just warm.

40:57.767 --> 40:59.769
Coming!

41:06.336 --> 41:07.696
Isn't it a good day?

41:16.227 --> 41:19.548
Lina! Lina!

41:36.648 --> 41:38.650
<i>Forgive me.</i>

41:44.456 --> 41:46.458
<i>What are you doing to her?</i>

41:52.705 --> 41:54.707
<i>Is she going to die?</i>

41:59.192 --> 42:01.194
Lina, I am here.

42:09.443 --> 42:11.445
Lina...

42:50.205 --> 42:52.448
And now you know of me.

42:54.210 --> 42:56.212
<i>Ai, ai, ai.</i>

43:19.236 --> 43:21.316
<i>Come quickly! Come, come!</i>

43:21.318 --> 43:24.079
Where are my ladies?

43:24.081 --> 43:27.044
Lina? Rosa?

43:31.969 --> 43:34.130
I do not understand why he
is in this wing of the castle

43:34.132 --> 43:35.531
and why I
cannot see him.

43:35.533 --> 43:36.812
Arthur.

43:36.814 --> 43:39.015
Don't come any closer.

43:39.017 --> 43:40.977
No, you must not.

43:40.979 --> 43:42.979
But what is the nature
of this illness?

43:42.981 --> 43:44.020
Stoke the fire.

43:44.022 --> 43:45.101
He must sweat it out.

43:45.103 --> 43:46.222
Yes, right away.

43:46.224 --> 43:47.584
Where are you...

43:47.586 --> 43:49.546
Why is he leaving
the prince?

43:49.548 --> 43:51.868
He's preparing him a draft.
They will not neglect him.

43:51.870 --> 43:53.190
<i>I am staying.</i>

43:53.192 --> 43:56.473
You can't, Your Grace.
It is the sweat.

43:56.475 --> 44:00.838
<i>Thousands died when the Tudor
army brought it to England.</i>

44:04.924 --> 44:06.926
It's all right.

44:10.169 --> 44:12.292
I will come
and get you very soon.

44:18.618 --> 44:20.620
News from Ludlow.

44:23.824 --> 44:25.826
<i>What is it?</i>

44:27.428 --> 44:29.267
I'll call for our escort.

44:29.269 --> 44:31.432
We have a long ride
ahead of us.

44:50.292 --> 44:52.412
I know how much
you love him.

44:52.414 --> 44:54.976
I also try
to love him.

44:56.498 --> 44:59.980
I know you love
the idea of being queen.

44:59.982 --> 45:02.302
You still think
so badly of me.

45:02.304 --> 45:04.985
<i>No, it's not your fault.</i>

45:04.987 --> 45:07.307
You were bred for it.

45:07.309 --> 45:10.591
But I have seen
so much ambition in my life.

45:10.593 --> 45:13.075
My family have been
the victims of it.

45:14.477 --> 45:16.479
Lady Pole...

45:17.800 --> 45:19.881
Maggie...

45:19.883 --> 45:21.442
<i>come.</i>

45:21.444 --> 45:23.446
Pray with me.

46:00.726 --> 46:02.846
You cannot risk this,
Your Grace.

46:02.848 --> 46:04.850
This is
too dangerous.

46:05.931 --> 46:07.933
Catherine, don't.

46:10.456 --> 46:11.895
Everybody out.

46:11.897 --> 46:14.700
Leave me
with my husband.

46:20.827 --> 46:22.827
S-Stay away.

46:24.070 --> 46:26.713
What can I do?

46:27.954 --> 46:29.956
What do you want?

46:34.881 --> 46:37.843
I want...

46:37.845 --> 46:39.847
to live.

46:42.770 --> 46:44.772
Your father
will ride to you.

46:45.973 --> 46:47.653
I know it.

46:51.819 --> 46:54.780
I'm sorry.

46:54.782 --> 46:59.427
They will... They will
send you back to Spain.

47:05.474 --> 47:08.915
And I dreamed of Camelot.

47:11.800 --> 47:16.685
And... And Teddy was
a knight of the Round Table.

47:19.809 --> 47:26.456
And he had
a place set for me.

47:49.520 --> 47:51.480
Not Arthur.

47:51.482 --> 47:53.922
Please, not Arthur.

49:21.376 --> 49:23.619
Amen.

49:46.683 --> 49:48.685
<i>Amen.</i>

49:52.209 --> 49:53.848
His body
comes to London.

49:53.850 --> 49:56.053
His heart will
be buried here.

50:11.109 --> 50:13.111
Amen.

50:33.932 --> 50:36.335
He found...

50:37.696 --> 50:40.299
happiness with you.

50:42.582 --> 50:45.625
I believe some,
Your Grace.

50:47.186 --> 50:50.188
<i>You will return
to Westminster with us.</i>

50:50.190 --> 50:53.713
We will see
if you are with child.

50:55.795 --> 50:57.798
Pray God you are.

51:05.486 --> 51:07.045
He liked honey.

51:07.047 --> 51:09.047
I will make sure
there is bread and honey

51:09.049 --> 51:11.051
after the funeral in London.

51:12.933 --> 51:14.936
Maggie?

51:15.937 --> 51:18.217
I told you
this would happen, Lizzie,

51:18.219 --> 51:22.183
and you let Teddy and your own
brother die on that scaffold.

51:23.465 --> 51:25.344
I told you
the Tudor curse

51:25.346 --> 51:27.947
would grip you
and your children.

51:27.949 --> 51:30.950
Where is his future now?

51:30.952 --> 51:33.913
Oh, Arthur, to be born
into such a family as this.

51:33.915 --> 51:35.918
You say too much.

51:36.959 --> 51:40.522
Perhaps you and the king have
enemies after all, Your Grace.

51:53.816 --> 51:58.700
Rosa says you sat with me
day and night.

51:58.702 --> 52:00.982
Not all the night, eh?

52:00.984 --> 52:04.305
I have to...
to sleep to keep my fine looks, no?

52:08.632 --> 52:11.395
You saved my life.

52:17.681 --> 52:19.684
For your trouble.

52:48.714 --> 52:51.315
Forgive me, Highness.

52:51.317 --> 52:54.919
I am told you were sick.

52:54.921 --> 52:57.563
I am much improved.

52:59.565 --> 53:01.568
I am glad.

53:03.970 --> 53:07.173
I am so sorry for your loss.

53:09.376 --> 53:14.059
He had hopes and dreams.

53:20.107 --> 53:23.030
We are returning to London
in the early morning.

53:43.331 --> 53:45.892
You wished to see me,
Lady grandmother?

53:45.894 --> 53:48.975
Yes. Our deal
with Spain has altered.

53:48.977 --> 53:51.618
Into what,
we don't know yet.

53:51.620 --> 53:56.425
God has turned our faces towards the
north, gently, but firmly.

53:57.626 --> 54:00.990
<i>We will need Scotland
more than ever now.</i>

55:13.026 --> 55:15.228
What will happen
to her now?

55:16.469 --> 55:19.032
I do not care
what will happen to her.
