WEBVTT

00:12.380 --> 00:15.283
(whirring, click)

00:15.316 --> 00:17.185
(clicking)

00:17.218 --> 00:18.686
(airy whistling)

00:18.719 --> 00:20.754
(whistling, doorbell rings)

00:20.788 --> 00:22.490
(humming)

00:23.824 --> 00:24.825
Hi.
Hi.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.360
Thank you so
much for coming.

00:26.394 --> 00:28.096
Hi. You said there was a...
an emergency? What?

00:28.129 --> 00:29.397
Yeah, yeah, I'm so--
something is wrong

00:29.430 --> 00:30.398
with my garbage disposal

00:30.431 --> 00:31.799
is completely clogged.

00:31.832 --> 00:33.334
I don't know what happened.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.703
And I know that, you know,
you're a real fixer

00:35.736 --> 00:38.172
from summer camp, wood shop,
making all those lanyards,

00:38.206 --> 00:39.073
so I figured
you could help me.

00:39.107 --> 00:40.408
And I know
that you're wondering, like,

00:40.441 --> 00:41.609
why haven't I called a service.

00:41.642 --> 00:44.078
Well, one time, I called
a service in New York,

00:44.112 --> 00:45.579
and the handyman stole
my grandmother's necklace

00:45.613 --> 00:48.149
from Krakow, so I thought
never again.
WHITE JOSH:
Wow.

00:48.182 --> 00:51.152
Wow, wow,
wow, wow, wow!
Oh.

00:51.185 --> 00:53.687
Hi, White Josh. You brought
White Josh. How nice.

00:53.721 --> 00:57.158
Very cool apartment.
How long you been here?

00:57.191 --> 00:59.827
* I was working hard
at a New York job *

00:59.860 --> 01:01.729
* Making dough
but it made me blue *

01:01.762 --> 01:03.464
* One day I was crying a lot

01:03.497 --> 01:04.532
* And so I decided to move

01:04.565 --> 01:06.267
* To West Covina, California

01:06.300 --> 01:07.535
* Brand new pals
and new career *

01:07.568 --> 01:09.703
* It happens to be
where Josh lives *

01:09.737 --> 01:12.340
* But that's not why I'm here

01:12.373 --> 01:14.442
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *
What? No, I'm not.

01:14.475 --> 01:16.177
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *

01:16.210 --> 01:17.178
That's a sexist term.

01:17.211 --> 01:18.679
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *

01:18.712 --> 01:19.813
Can you guys stop singing
for just a second?

01:19.847 --> 01:22.450
* She's so broken inside *

01:22.483 --> 01:23.884
The situation's a lot more
nuanced than that.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.886
* C-R-A-Z-Y *

01:25.919 --> 01:27.455
Okay! We get it!

01:27.488 --> 01:29.657
* Crazy ex-girlfriend. *

01:29.690 --> 01:32.660
So, uh...
so you got a clog, huh?

01:32.693 --> 01:34.162
Sure it's not
an obstruction,

01:34.195 --> 01:35.563
backup? Could be a stoppage.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.765
I... I have no idea.

01:37.798 --> 01:40.634
Let me take a look.

01:40.668 --> 01:43.637
Whoa. There's like a
crapload of chicken in here.

01:43.671 --> 01:45.406
It's almost like you
tried to break it.

01:45.439 --> 01:48.376
Okay, um, so,
while White Josh

01:48.409 --> 01:51.245
is fixing the garbage disposal,
why don't you and I catch up?

01:51.279 --> 01:52.380
So, how have you been?

01:52.413 --> 01:53.881
Sorry about WhiJo.

01:53.914 --> 01:55.916
You know, Valencia
is still not super psyched

01:55.949 --> 01:58.352
about you and I hanging out
alone together,

01:58.386 --> 02:00.654
so, in case
she finds out I was here,

02:00.688 --> 02:03.257
I can say
White Josh was here, too.

02:03.291 --> 02:06.760
Valencia-- when she gets mad,
she, like-- ugh-- hulks out.

02:06.794 --> 02:08.496
But what's she mad
about? Like, I don't...

02:08.529 --> 02:10.264
I don't really understand
what she's mad about.

02:10.298 --> 02:11.765
Ugh! Are you crazy?!

02:11.799 --> 02:13.534
Why does everyone want
to have sex with me?

02:13.567 --> 02:16.437
It's a circle of love, because
I love you, you love Josh,

02:16.470 --> 02:18.506
and Josh and I used
to love each other.

02:18.539 --> 02:19.707
Oh, that.

02:19.740 --> 02:21.275
Yeah.
Oh, she's still
angry about that?

02:21.309 --> 02:22.543
Oh, my God!

02:22.576 --> 02:24.412
It's like,
shake it off, girlfriend.

02:24.445 --> 02:25.946
That was ages ago!

02:25.979 --> 02:27.681
It was six days ago.

02:27.715 --> 02:29.817
Well, yeah, I mean,
I just need a buffer, you know.

02:29.850 --> 02:31.185
Yeah.
Especially since Valencia's...

02:31.219 --> 02:32.886
She's out of town
at some yoga retreat.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.555
Oh, she's out of town?

02:34.588 --> 02:36.557
You know, it's so funny
that she's so angry

02:36.590 --> 02:37.958
because I've tried
to tell her repeatedly

02:37.991 --> 02:39.460
that you and I
are just friends

02:39.493 --> 02:41.295
and that I'm really on the hunt

02:41.329 --> 02:42.963
for, like, cute,
single guys, you know.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.966
It's so hot in here. Aah!

02:45.999 --> 02:49.337
Hey, buddy, if you're gonna
sweat, can you put down a towel?

02:49.370 --> 02:50.971
Oh, sorry. I'm actually...
I'm done, anyway.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.440
Disposal's fixed.

02:52.473 --> 02:54.275
Oh, great.
Then we should jet.

02:54.308 --> 02:55.443
Oh. Wait, wait,
wait, wait!

02:55.476 --> 02:58.212
Why-why don't we... why don't
we watch a movie, and-and...

02:58.246 --> 02:59.847
and Buffer can play
with my phone?
Hmm?

02:59.880 --> 03:01.915
Here you go, bud.
Ah.

03:01.949 --> 03:03.917
You got a step counter on here?

03:03.951 --> 03:06.787
Whoa! It is very low.
I'm gonna catch you up.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.889
Uh, no, we got to go.

03:08.922 --> 03:11.559
Anyway, don't you have,
like, work or something?

03:11.592 --> 03:13.927
Um, actually,
today is Weekend Tuesday.

03:13.961 --> 03:16.464
Yeah, it's like,
uh, Casual Friday, but

03:16.497 --> 03:18.799
even more chill
and on a Tuesday.

03:18.832 --> 03:20.334
And, um, we make it up

03:20.368 --> 03:21.802
by working Saturdays
once a quarter.

03:21.835 --> 03:23.237
That sounds confusing.

03:23.271 --> 03:24.505
I don't disagree.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.440
Uh, yeah, come on,
dude, we got to go.

03:26.474 --> 03:27.908
Um, it was great
to see you, Becks.

03:27.941 --> 03:29.377
You know, glad we could help.

03:29.410 --> 03:30.711
Just a little advice.

03:30.744 --> 03:32.346
Uh, no chicken in
the disposal ever.

03:32.380 --> 03:34.715
Also, no fish bones,
also, uh, no seeds.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.484
Also, lemons seem bad,
but they're actually good.

03:36.517 --> 03:37.651
Cool.

03:37.685 --> 03:39.487
Thanks for the tips.
Thanks for the help.
Uh-huh. Sure.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.455
Uh, put on a shirt
'cause no one wants to see that.

03:41.489 --> 03:42.890
I'm so sorry.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's totally fine.

03:42.923 --> 03:44.492
Yeah, no. No problem.

03:44.525 --> 03:45.459
Sorry.
See you, Becks.

03:45.493 --> 03:47.995
All right.
(door opens)

03:48.028 --> 03:49.763
(door closes)

03:49.797 --> 03:51.899
Oh, God.

03:51.932 --> 03:54.802
(whimpering)

04:03.411 --> 04:04.878
Darryl Whitefeather.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.880
Hi, Darryl. It's Rebecca.

04:06.914 --> 04:09.383
Listen, I don't know if I'm
gonna make it in to work today.

04:09.417 --> 04:10.551
Oh, why?

04:10.584 --> 04:12.786
I'm just not...
I'm not feeling well.

04:12.820 --> 04:16.290
Oh, really? What-what is it?

04:16.324 --> 04:20.394
Um... my ovaries are eking out

04:20.428 --> 04:22.930
into my fallopian tubes,
and they're wrapped around...

04:22.963 --> 04:25.399
You know what? We'll see you
when you're feeling better.

04:25.433 --> 04:27.401
Yeah. Okay, thanks.

04:27.435 --> 04:30.070
Wow. Men are stupid.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.872
(knocking)

04:31.905 --> 04:33.073
Come in.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.708
(door opens)

04:34.742 --> 04:36.777
PAULA:
Darryl said
your uterus exploded.

04:36.810 --> 04:39.547
You know,
if that's true, should

04:39.580 --> 04:40.814
probably go to the hospital
or something.

04:40.848 --> 04:42.550
I know

04:42.583 --> 04:44.918
what this is.
This is Chan-itus.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.955
Again, I just moved here
for a change. I didn't

04:47.988 --> 04:49.390
move here
for Josh.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

04:49.423 --> 04:51.559
Yeah, yeah. I got it...
West Covina. Pretzel...

04:51.592 --> 04:52.960
Got it.
Okay.

04:52.993 --> 04:54.895
Fine. You know, I'll admit it.

04:55.863 --> 04:57.531
I want to be his friend.

04:57.565 --> 04:59.767
Okay? Sue me.
But now his

04:59.800 --> 05:02.102
stupid, dum-dum-face girlfriend

05:02.135 --> 05:04.972
has officially barred him
from being alone with me.

05:05.005 --> 05:06.607
Yeah, I saw that coming.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.577
I don't know what to do.

05:09.610 --> 05:12.112
Well, that's okay, 'cause I do.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.481
Huh?
Oh, come on.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.048
It's a classic dilemma.

05:15.082 --> 05:17.050
How do you see your crush...

05:17.084 --> 05:19.653
I mean, friend-- without
pissing off his girlfriend,

05:19.687 --> 05:23.924
and look fabu in a super-tight
low-cut dress in the process?

05:23.957 --> 05:26.126
There's a solution,
a loophole.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.862
It is in every teen movie
ever made.

05:28.896 --> 05:30.998
It's a car wash?

05:31.031 --> 05:32.600
Throw a big party!

05:32.633 --> 05:35.736
No.
What?

05:35.769 --> 05:37.004
Yes, throw a big party.

05:37.037 --> 05:38.439
That way, when Josh comes,

05:38.472 --> 05:39.907
you're not technically
alone with him,

05:39.940 --> 05:42.743
and then he can't
get in trouble!
Okay, I see your logic--

05:42.776 --> 05:44.912
very sound logic,
um, but I don't do that.

05:44.945 --> 05:47.147
I don't throw parties.
It's not a thing I do.

05:47.180 --> 05:50.017
I go to parties.
Okay. Why?

05:50.050 --> 05:52.019
(sighs)
Oh, God, um...

05:52.052 --> 05:55.589
it's, like, a super long story.

05:55.623 --> 05:57.825
Okay, um, ooh...

05:57.858 --> 06:00.027
So, when I was 12...
PAULA:
 Okay.

06:00.060 --> 06:01.228
No, no.
I don't have time for this.

06:01.261 --> 06:04.498
What happened? The tissues
fell out of your training bra?

06:04.532 --> 06:07.034
You perioded on a white couch?
We've all been there.

06:07.067 --> 06:10.904
I perioded on an
ultra suede settee in 1987

06:10.938 --> 06:12.940
at Roberta Janatelli's
condo, and

06:12.973 --> 06:16.444
I got to tell you, it
was still a great party.

06:16.477 --> 06:18.579
I wrapped a sweater
around my waist,

06:18.612 --> 06:21.649
then hooked up with
Bobby Henderson anyway.

06:21.682 --> 06:23.517
And started the whole, um,

06:23.551 --> 06:25.453
sweater-around-the-waist
trend while I was at it.

06:25.486 --> 06:26.754
So, you're welcome.

06:26.787 --> 06:28.922
Paula, you don't understand
what I am saying.

06:28.956 --> 06:31.058
I need you to listen
to me, okay?

06:31.091 --> 06:35.529
This was the worst party
of all time.

06:35.563 --> 06:38.799
So, I invited everyone in my
 grade to come over to my house

06:38.832 --> 06:40.634
and watch the pay-per-view
 concert of my favorite

06:40.668 --> 06:41.969
boy band, Room Temperature.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.704
So, I threw this party,

06:43.737 --> 06:45.839
and this is how many people
 showed up.

06:45.873 --> 06:47.775
(dinging)

06:47.808 --> 06:49.443
Concert starts in ten minutes!

06:49.477 --> 06:51.479
Who's psyched?!

06:51.512 --> 06:53.213
Well,

06:53.246 --> 06:55.549
that was a tepid response.

06:55.583 --> 06:57.084
(laughs)
Get it?

06:57.117 --> 06:59.019
It's a temperature joke.

06:59.052 --> 07:00.688
And then it happened.

07:00.721 --> 07:03.090
WOMAN:
Keep your voice down.
She's having a party.

07:03.123 --> 07:05.593
MAN:
You call that a party? That's
her and her three loser friends.

07:05.626 --> 07:06.927
You couldn't even
throw her a decent party!

07:06.960 --> 07:08.562
WOMAN:
Well, then why don't
you call your whore

07:08.596 --> 07:09.830
and ask her what
she would do?!

07:09.863 --> 07:13.834
Um, they're just
rehearsing a play called

07:13.867 --> 07:15.569
The Worst Parents Ever.

07:15.603 --> 07:18.539
It's going up at the
Westchester Community Playhouse.

07:18.572 --> 07:19.740
That's it.
I've had it.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.575
Hey, I'll get you tickets.
Who wants tickets?

07:21.609 --> 07:22.810
If you walk out that door,

07:22.843 --> 07:23.944
I don't ever want
to see you again!

07:23.977 --> 07:25.078
Is that a promise?
Yes!

07:25.112 --> 07:26.446
Can I get that
in writing?!
Yes!

07:38.125 --> 07:39.760
Good luck, kiddo.

07:41.161 --> 07:42.930
I got to get out of here.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.732
WOMAN:
Don't you dare.

07:44.765 --> 07:47.100
Don't you dare.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.639
(yelling):
Don't you dare!

07:51.672 --> 07:53.874
(door closes)

07:53.907 --> 07:55.743
(panting)

07:55.776 --> 07:57.778
(door closes)

07:57.811 --> 08:00.047
(voice breaking):
Don't tell anybody

08:00.080 --> 08:03.651
at school about this, okay?

08:06.219 --> 08:07.655
Oh, my God.

08:07.688 --> 08:10.758
It's the root
of all my party fears.

08:10.791 --> 08:13.527
Actually, it's the root
of all my fears, period.

08:13.561 --> 08:17.598
Babe, you don't think
that I get being afraid?

08:17.631 --> 08:20.901
I wake up every
morning in cold sweats

08:20.934 --> 08:23.236
worried that I'm
wasting my entire life

08:23.270 --> 08:26.139
with a man who spends all his
time with a barbershop quartet

08:26.173 --> 08:28.642
called The West Brovinas.

08:28.676 --> 08:30.243
No, you never
told me the name.
Yes.

08:30.277 --> 08:31.879
And my children-- I mean,
their only hope is

08:31.912 --> 08:34.081
that they get into
a really good gang.

08:34.114 --> 08:36.984
I mean, honey, I am scared
every day of my life.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.919
But you can be brave.
I know you can.

08:39.953 --> 08:43.557
All you got to do is stand up to
your fears, do you understand?

08:43.591 --> 08:45.826
I understand you
in theory.
Listen to me.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.161
Listen to me. His
GF is out of town.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.063
The moment is now!

08:50.097 --> 08:52.199
Or is it, like,
some time other than now?

08:52.232 --> 08:56.837
Like...
Shh...!

08:58.238 --> 09:01.074
* I used to be afraid

09:01.108 --> 09:04.211
* Of so much in this world

09:04.244 --> 09:07.147
* I'd tiptoe through each day

09:07.180 --> 09:11.084
* Like some frightened
little girl *

09:11.118 --> 09:13.320
* Then one day I realized

09:13.353 --> 09:17.825
* I can't just run
and hide from life *

09:17.858 --> 09:21.161
* Now if someone pulls
a gun on me *

09:21.194 --> 09:23.764
* I pull out my knife!

09:23.797 --> 09:25.766
I don't follow.

09:25.799 --> 09:28.168
Sit on my lap like I'm
Santa and listen to me.

09:28.201 --> 09:31.972
* Face your fears

09:32.005 --> 09:34.808
* Stare them down

09:34.842 --> 09:37.678
* Don't be scared

09:37.711 --> 09:41.248
* Stand your ground

09:41.281 --> 09:47.387
* 'Cause nothing is
as scary as it appears *

09:47.420 --> 09:50.891
* All you gotta do is
face your fears *

09:50.924 --> 09:53.694
Okay, I think I'm starting to
get it-- what you're talk...

09:53.727 --> 09:56.163
* If a bear runs at you
in the woods *

09:56.196 --> 09:57.464
* Don't run away

09:57.497 --> 10:00.267
Yeah, I'm back here.
Sing to me.
* Look it deep in the eyes

10:00.300 --> 10:02.135
* Put your hand
on its chest and say *

10:02.169 --> 10:03.971
* "Bear, I'm not afraid"

10:04.004 --> 10:05.172
Well, that's just dangerous.

10:05.205 --> 10:07.775
* If you're in
a burning building *

10:07.808 --> 10:11.311
* And smoke is everywhere

10:11.344 --> 10:13.413
* Keep calm,
take a deep breath *

10:13.446 --> 10:16.016
* And stay right there!

10:16.049 --> 10:18.118
That's not how smoke
or fire works.
Shh.

10:18.151 --> 10:21.855
* Face your fears

10:21.889 --> 10:23.857
* Run with scissors

10:23.891 --> 10:24.825
Whoa.

10:24.858 --> 10:27.695
* 'Cause you can fly

10:27.728 --> 10:30.197
* Yes, you can fly

10:30.230 --> 10:32.032
* Fly out of a window

10:32.065 --> 10:33.701
Who are you
singing to?

10:33.734 --> 10:35.703
* Fly off a building

10:35.736 --> 10:39.139
* Just believe in yourself

10:39.172 --> 10:41.141
* Face your fears

10:41.174 --> 10:43.076
Okay, I have so many problems...

10:43.110 --> 10:46.279
* 'Cause the children
are the future *

10:47.748 --> 10:50.718
* Ah... *

10:50.751 --> 10:53.320
* Face your fears
* Face your fears *

10:53.353 --> 10:54.221
Oh, my God.

10:54.254 --> 10:55.388
* Follow your dreams

10:55.422 --> 10:57.090
* Follow your dreams *

10:57.124 --> 10:58.358
* Stare at the sun

10:58.391 --> 10:59.860
* Stare at the sun *

10:59.893 --> 11:01.328
* Play in the street

11:01.361 --> 11:02.996
* A busy street *
* If you're

11:03.030 --> 11:04.364
* Scared of bees

11:04.397 --> 11:06.166
* If you're scared of bees *

11:06.199 --> 11:08.936
* Get stung
* Don't have an EpiPen ready *

11:08.969 --> 11:11.338
* Reach for the stars
* Literally touch a star *

11:11.371 --> 11:14.708
* Face your fears
* Stars aren't that hot *

11:14.742 --> 11:17.144
* Face your fears
* Face your fears *

11:17.177 --> 11:19.079
* Join the Marines

11:19.112 --> 11:20.447
* Join the Marines *
* Swim

11:20.480 --> 11:22.215
* Right after eating
* Don't wait *

11:22.249 --> 11:23.483
* 30 minutes *

11:23.516 --> 11:25.252
* 'Cause you are amazing

11:25.285 --> 11:26.353
* So amazing *
* Wipe

11:26.386 --> 11:27.955
* Back to front

11:27.988 --> 11:29.389
* Don't wipe front to back *

11:29.422 --> 11:30.958
* Drop out of school

11:30.991 --> 11:34.261
* School is stupid *

11:34.294 --> 11:36.730
* All you got to

11:36.764 --> 11:43.070
* Do...

11:43.103 --> 11:44.738
Is face my fears?

11:44.772 --> 11:47.240
* Is face your...

11:47.274 --> 11:48.475
Fears, I-I got it.

11:48.508 --> 11:53.480
* Fears...

11:53.513 --> 11:56.850
* Ah... *

11:56.884 --> 11:58.218
* Yeah.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.822
Okay.

12:01.855 --> 12:03.156
Okay?

12:03.190 --> 12:06.326
Yeah. That was, like,
really convincing.

12:06.359 --> 12:07.460
I mean,
like,

12:07.494 --> 12:09.963
kind of disturbing
but also convincing.

12:09.997 --> 12:11.031
Yeah, you're right,
Paula.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.265
Now that I've run all this

12:12.299 --> 12:13.867
through the logic processor,
like,

12:13.901 --> 12:17.204
of course my dad isn't gonna
walk out on me again.

12:17.237 --> 12:20.340
So... yes?

12:20.373 --> 12:20.874
Yes!

12:20.908 --> 12:22.810
Ooh, yes! Ah, good!

12:22.843 --> 12:24.878
Okay, pity party over.
Let's throw a real party!

12:24.912 --> 12:26.947
Aah! I'm horrified.
Game plan.
Okay.

12:26.980 --> 12:27.848
But let's do it!
Yeah. Yay!

12:32.920 --> 12:34.922
(humming softly)
Oh, you know
what would be awesome?

12:35.488 --> 12:38.425
We need salt.

12:38.458 --> 12:42.162
Um, since it's
Weekend Tuesday, um,

12:42.195 --> 12:44.297
can we just go home?

12:44.331 --> 12:46.566
(chuckles)
See, it's Weekend Tuesday,

12:46.599 --> 12:48.535
but it's not the real weekend.

12:48.568 --> 12:49.903
Now, look,
Bill,

12:49.937 --> 12:51.104
why don't you put on
that sombrero

12:51.138 --> 12:54.441
and then head on
back to work?

12:54.474 --> 12:57.177
Right.
Right?

12:57.210 --> 13:00.080
Weekend
Tuesday.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.950
So, the first thing we need
to do is choose a theme.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.117
Don't worry about that.
I have planned

13:04.151 --> 13:06.086
a million parties in my life.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.187
I will take care
of that part.

13:07.220 --> 13:08.521
You handle the invites.

13:08.555 --> 13:09.356
Okay.
Okay?
Ladies,

13:09.389 --> 13:11.358
are you working
on the Castwick case?

13:11.391 --> 13:13.493
Because it's...
Weekend Tuesday, Darryl.

13:13.526 --> 13:14.561
Okay.

13:14.594 --> 13:15.362
Yeah.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.030
No. Sorry. You're right.

13:17.064 --> 13:20.533
I may not have thought
this day through.

13:24.404 --> 13:26.039
PAULA:
 Hey, Brendan,

13:26.073 --> 13:28.241
have you seen that tablecloth
with the roses on it?

13:28.275 --> 13:31.044
What? Haven't seen it.

13:31.078 --> 13:33.113
Hey, what have I said
about the katana on the table?

13:33.146 --> 13:35.448
Or...

13:35.482 --> 13:38.251
you could just stare at me
like a serial killer.

13:38.285 --> 13:39.853
Scott?

13:39.887 --> 13:41.855
Scott!
(humming)

13:44.424 --> 13:46.526
Scott!
Huh? Huh?

13:46.559 --> 13:48.461
What? Sorry. We have
the semifinals coming up

13:48.495 --> 13:49.863
against the Glendorables.

13:49.897 --> 13:51.531
They're the a cappella
group from Glendora.

13:51.564 --> 13:54.501
They're the best in the state.
(humming)
Okay, I'm looking

13:54.534 --> 13:56.136
for that white tablecloth
that we have,

13:56.169 --> 13:57.337
the one with the roses on it.

13:57.370 --> 13:58.872
Yeah, I saw it.
(gasps)
Great!

13:58.906 --> 14:01.008
Where is it?
Wait!
I threw it out. (humming)

14:01.041 --> 14:03.210
You threw it out?
That was from our wedding.

14:03.243 --> 14:04.277
I gave it to Goodwill
when you asked me

14:04.311 --> 14:05.445
to clean out the cabinet.

14:05.478 --> 14:07.180
Okay, well, if I asked you

14:07.214 --> 14:08.448
to take out the recyclables,

14:08.481 --> 14:09.917
would you throw out
our wedding album?

14:09.950 --> 14:12.185
'Cause it is partly made
of paper.

14:12.219 --> 14:13.453
I don't know
what you're asking me.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.588
(humming)

14:15.622 --> 14:18.025
You know, the world doesn't
revolve around barbershop.

14:18.058 --> 14:20.427
Nothing revolves
around barbershop!

14:20.460 --> 14:23.163
Not even
a revolving barbershop pole

14:23.196 --> 14:25.899
revolves around barbershop.

14:25.933 --> 14:27.200
This damn teacher.
Teacher's...

14:27.234 --> 14:30.037
(groans)
Stupid...

14:30.070 --> 14:31.238
What's up, Tommy?

14:31.271 --> 14:34.041
I have a test tomorrow, and
I don't know any of this stuff.

14:34.074 --> 14:35.442
I'm stupid.

14:35.475 --> 14:37.610
You are not stupid.

14:37.644 --> 14:40.347
You are in the highest
percentiles of kids with ADHD

14:40.380 --> 14:43.183
and OCD and SAD
and a panic disorder

14:43.216 --> 14:44.918
and restless leg syndrome...

14:44.952 --> 14:47.320
Mom, I'm gonna fail the test.

14:47.354 --> 14:50.023
You're not.
I know you're not.

14:50.057 --> 14:52.960
Look, just, you know,
don't be afraid

14:52.993 --> 14:55.495
and-and face your fears.

14:55.528 --> 14:58.465
Run with scissors,
you know?

14:58.498 --> 14:59.967
What?

15:00.000 --> 15:02.002
That's bad advice, Mom.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.540
REBECCA (singsongy):
 Hey!

15:10.410 --> 15:12.379
It's a house warming, get it?

15:12.412 --> 15:15.082
Yeah. No, I get it.
I get it. It's just,

15:15.115 --> 15:17.951
you know, it kind of looks
like you're going

15:17.985 --> 15:20.620
to light your house
on fire.
No.

15:20.653 --> 15:23.123
No, I don't see that. Mm-mm.
Okay.

15:23.156 --> 15:25.092
Whatever. You know what,
it's gonna be fine.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.494
Do you promise?

15:27.527 --> 15:30.063
Yes, I promise.

15:30.097 --> 15:31.631
You got this.

15:31.664 --> 15:34.434
Okay? You are
a smart,
Okay.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.103
confident woman

15:36.136 --> 15:39.706
who's in charge
of her own destiny.

15:39.739 --> 15:41.408
That sounds like a tampon
commercial. But you know...

15:41.441 --> 15:42.675
you know where I'm going
with this, right?
Yeah. Yeah.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.311
Okay, now, who you gonna pass
these out to?

15:44.344 --> 15:47.047
Oh, come on, you know people.
You know people

15:47.080 --> 15:49.749
since you've been here.
You go to that spinning class.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.519
You have people
in your apartment complex.

15:52.552 --> 15:55.655
Yeah... No, no, you're right.

15:55.688 --> 15:57.124
Now that I'm thinking about it,

15:57.157 --> 15:58.691
I definitely know
a lot of people.

15:58.725 --> 15:59.592
Tons of people.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.128
I'm psyched!
(chuckles)

16:01.161 --> 16:03.063
God, this time's gonna be
totally different.

16:03.096 --> 16:06.266
You're right. It's not
like seventh grade at all.

16:06.299 --> 16:09.402
*

16:09.436 --> 16:12.539
* I have friends,
I definitely have friends *

16:12.572 --> 16:16.043
* No one can say
that I do not have friends *

16:16.076 --> 16:18.645
* I have friends,
I definitely have friends *

16:18.678 --> 16:20.513
* Friends, friends,
friendly friends *

16:20.547 --> 16:22.282

16:22.315 --> 16:23.550
I'm Patty!

16:23.583 --> 16:25.685
(shyly):
Luan.

16:25.718 --> 16:28.721
Jason and I'm super
into Dance Dance Revolution!

16:28.755 --> 16:30.523
Girl with mustache!

16:30.557 --> 16:32.425

16:32.459 --> 16:35.428
Janitor who lives in an RV
behind the school.

16:35.462 --> 16:38.531
* I have friends,
I definitely have friends *
REBECCA: Oh, yeah!

16:38.565 --> 16:41.701
* I have friends,
I definitely have friends *

16:41.734 --> 16:45.272
* Objectively, I can say
that I have all the friends *

16:45.305 --> 16:48.475
* I have friends,
I definitely have friends *

16:48.508 --> 16:50.210
* Friends, friends,
friendly friends *

16:50.243 --> 16:51.478
* Time to meet my friends

16:51.511 --> 16:52.812
I'm Paula!

16:52.845 --> 16:54.714
Darryl!

16:58.518 --> 17:00.187
Lady who hit your car!

17:00.220 --> 17:01.488
Friend of friend
from law school?

17:01.521 --> 17:05.224
Grocery clerk
with half an eyelid!

17:05.258 --> 17:07.660
BOTH:
* We have friends,
we definitely have friends *

17:07.694 --> 17:11.330
* No one can say
that we do not have friends *

17:11.364 --> 17:14.733
* We have friends,
we definitely have friends *

17:14.767 --> 17:16.403
* Friends, friends,
friendly friends *

17:16.435 --> 17:18.105
* We have all the friends
Cool!

17:20.240 --> 17:23.210
It went great. I think lots
of cool people are gonna come.

17:23.242 --> 17:25.478
Yeah. Everybody loved my flyer.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.114
Oh, and, B-T-dubs,

17:27.146 --> 17:28.748
nobody thought it looked
like a house burning down,

17:28.781 --> 17:31.718
so, you know...
Nice. I knew you could do it,
girl.

17:31.751 --> 17:34.487
(quietly):
Now you just got to get Josh
and his friends.

17:34.521 --> 17:36.756
On it, doin' it,
crushin' it, bye.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.362
Hey, Chris,
you seen Chan?

17:42.395 --> 17:44.264
S-Sorry, what was that?

17:44.297 --> 17:46.466
Have you seen Josh Chan?

17:46.499 --> 17:49.536
Nah, but you're lookin' sweet.

17:49.569 --> 17:52.539
Thank you, young man.

17:52.572 --> 17:55.275
I'm lookin' sweet.

17:55.308 --> 17:57.810
(sighs)

17:59.779 --> 18:01.748
Hi, Greg.

18:01.781 --> 18:04.117
Put those things away. You're
gonna poke a kid's eye out.

18:04.151 --> 18:06.386
(chuckles)
You're funny.

18:06.419 --> 18:10.223
You're funny in that way
that I'm sure other people like.
Wow.

18:10.257 --> 18:12.792
Charming on you looks
really great.
Okay,

18:12.825 --> 18:15.128
let's start over. Look,
I know that you're probably

18:15.162 --> 18:18.165
a little, like, miffed at me
from the way things went down

18:18.198 --> 18:19.399
at Spiders the other night.
Um,

18:19.432 --> 18:21.868
as I remember it, you weren't
too thrilled with me either.

18:21.901 --> 18:24.604
I was gonna apologize for that,
and then I forgot.

18:24.637 --> 18:25.905
But I'm sorry.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.241
So let's just move on.
I'm here

18:28.275 --> 18:31.711
to invite you to the biggest
event of the season.

18:31.744 --> 18:33.613
A party.

18:33.646 --> 18:35.615
Wow. A flyer.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.684
Is it also, like,
a church bake sale, too?

18:37.717 --> 18:40.787
It's gonna be so fun.
And I actually...

18:40.820 --> 18:42.555
I really would like you to come.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.524
Let's review.
We've been out twice.

18:44.557 --> 18:47.727
The first time, we kissed
and then you started crying.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.363
The second time, you kissed
a girl, she didn't like it,

18:50.397 --> 18:53.433
and she left crying. We don't
have a good track record here.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.635
Dude, like, that actually
really hurts my feelings,

18:55.668 --> 18:58.571
because I consider you to be one
of my best friends here.

18:58.605 --> 19:00.373
What?
Yeah,
I do.

19:00.407 --> 19:03.376
True, we've had
some "altercations,"

19:03.410 --> 19:04.711
if that's what you call them,

19:04.744 --> 19:06.579
yeah, but that's
the hallmark

19:06.613 --> 19:08.615
of, like, a strong friendship,
you know?

19:08.648 --> 19:11.684
Saying the worst possible things
to each other

19:11.718 --> 19:14.521
and then going to a party.

19:14.554 --> 19:15.722
Wow. It is so tempting.

19:15.755 --> 19:17.724
It is so tempt... No.

19:17.757 --> 19:21.328
Okay. Wow. Okay.

19:21.361 --> 19:23.463
You know, I tried extending
the olive branch to you,

19:23.496 --> 19:26.633
and you just took those olives
and you plucked 'em

19:26.666 --> 19:29.336
and you chopped them up
into a tapenade of reproach...

19:29.369 --> 19:30.603
You know
what,

19:30.637 --> 19:31.638
never mind.
I don't care anymore.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.473
Um, good-bye.

19:33.506 --> 19:34.607
(exhales)

19:34.641 --> 19:36.209
(quietly):
Face your fears.

19:36.243 --> 19:38.778
Hey, Josh,
do you want to come to a party?

19:46.819 --> 19:49.589
I'm throwing a...

19:49.622 --> 19:51.358
party. You should come.

19:51.391 --> 19:53.226
No way! That's awesome!

19:53.260 --> 19:55.462
Yeah. See? This is

19:55.495 --> 19:56.996
how a human being
responds

19:57.029 --> 19:59.532
to another human being's
party invitation.

19:59.566 --> 20:00.600
You're not a human being.
Oh, just throw
a barb

20:00.633 --> 20:02.502
at me and then go
to the stockroom. Real mature.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.737
He's so immature.
Sorry about that.

20:04.771 --> 20:07.340
We have kind of a... like,
a Sam and Diane thing going on,

20:07.374 --> 20:10.477
except it's, um, unpleasant
and unsexy.

20:10.510 --> 20:11.511
Yeah, so it's
just gonna be a...

20:11.544 --> 20:14.647
housewarming shindig
with a-a gaggle of peeps.

20:14.681 --> 20:16.883
And I thought that, you know,
Valencia would be cool with it

20:16.916 --> 20:18.885
since we won't
technically be alone.

20:18.918 --> 20:20.920
Right?
Huh.

20:20.953 --> 20:22.489
So do you think
you might make it?

20:22.522 --> 20:23.656
Sure.

20:23.690 --> 20:24.491
Oh, huzzah!

20:24.524 --> 20:25.492
(chuckles)

20:25.525 --> 20:26.893
I mean, that's super...

20:26.926 --> 20:28.761
that's super cool,
just 'cause, like, it's gonna be

20:28.795 --> 20:30.697
really chill. Yeah.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.299
Cool. And maybe you could bring,
Yeah.

20:32.332 --> 20:33.900
uh, Hector and White Josh?

20:33.933 --> 20:35.468
Oh, man. They're out of town.

20:35.502 --> 20:37.870
Surf championship in Redondo.

20:37.904 --> 20:40.373
But I'm sure you have
other people to invite, right?

20:40.407 --> 20:42.609
Yeah. No,
I'm-I'm inviting, like...

20:42.642 --> 20:44.377
so many people.

20:44.411 --> 20:45.512
So, um,

20:45.545 --> 20:48.915
I will... I'll see you
at my party?

20:48.948 --> 20:49.782
Sure.

20:49.816 --> 20:50.983
Okay. Cool.

20:51.017 --> 20:52.652
Cool.
I'll see you there.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.403
Hi.

21:10.437 --> 21:11.871
No solicitors.

21:11.904 --> 21:13.640
Oh, no, no.
I live next-door, remember?

21:14.674 --> 21:16.376
Oh... yeah.

21:16.409 --> 21:17.310
Yeah, it's me. You know,

21:17.344 --> 21:18.845
I was going around,
introducing myself,

21:18.878 --> 21:20.313
handing out
those croissants

21:20.347 --> 21:21.047
that I made.

21:21.080 --> 21:23.416
Yeah, I remember you.
(sighs)

21:23.450 --> 21:26.453
Look, just as a tip, we don't...
actually, like,

21:26.486 --> 21:28.555
talk to each other around here.

21:28.588 --> 21:32.058
That guy has lived next-door
to me for, like, 11 years,

21:32.091 --> 21:33.993
and, like, I say "guy,"
but honestly,

21:34.026 --> 21:35.962
it could be, like...

21:35.995 --> 21:38.665
a stack of cats in a jumpsuit.
Okay.

21:38.698 --> 21:40.367
Appreciate the info.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.469
But... I like to consider myself
a bridge builder,

21:42.502 --> 21:43.870
and I feel like you and I

21:43.903 --> 21:45.037
could shake things
up around here.

21:45.071 --> 21:47.474
Yeah, no,
I don't see that happening,

21:47.507 --> 21:49.976
but anyways... nice to meet you,

21:50.009 --> 21:51.811
stack of cats in a...

21:51.844 --> 21:53.112
shirt.
Wait, wait!

21:53.145 --> 21:56.082
The reason I'm here is
I want to invite you
to an awesome party.

21:56.115 --> 21:58.785
It's gonna be full-on.
It's gonna be full-on!

21:58.818 --> 22:00.353
And I really want
you to be there,

22:00.387 --> 22:01.354
'cause you're the
coolest person

22:01.388 --> 22:02.622
I think I've ever met.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.991
Um, so I would like
you to come to it.

22:05.024 --> 22:08.495
But I'm sensing the slightest
undercurrent of resistance,

22:08.528 --> 22:10.763
so now I'm kind of...
What time should I come over?

22:10.797 --> 22:12.131
Wait. You want to come?

22:12.164 --> 22:15.868
Not to party or anything,
but just, like...

22:15.902 --> 22:18.004
to watch you.

22:18.037 --> 22:19.606
Okay.

22:19.639 --> 22:21.908
I kind of think
you're fascinating, actually.

22:21.941 --> 22:25.545
And I'm taking abnormal psych
at the JC, and I think...

22:25.578 --> 22:28.781
you would make, like,
a really good paper.

22:28.815 --> 22:31.584
Why, thank you, madam.

22:31.618 --> 22:33.520
Yeah, see, like that.

22:33.553 --> 22:35.154
That would just...

22:35.187 --> 22:39.492
be, like, an "A" right there.
Like, done.

22:39.526 --> 22:40.893
* It's the sexy
getting-ready song... *

22:40.927 --> 22:43.696
Hi.
(singsongy):
Look what I have!

22:43.730 --> 22:45.398
Oh.

22:45.432 --> 22:48.134
Isn't it amaz...? It's like
a box of fantastic-ness.

22:49.936 --> 22:52.905
Okay, so instead
of having just one theme,

22:52.939 --> 22:54.874
we're having
 all of the themes.

22:54.907 --> 22:58.144
And we even have...
a Valentine's Day piñata.

22:58.177 --> 23:00.880
Okay, you know what,
yeah, it's, like,
hipster-y and ironic.

23:00.913 --> 23:02.882
Like, I could see,
like, a BuzzFeed
article about it.

23:02.915 --> 23:04.150
Okay, cool.
I'm down, I'm down.

23:04.183 --> 23:05.151
Okay, let's go over
the guest list.

23:05.184 --> 23:07.654
So we got Josh,
my super cool neighbor Heather,

23:07.687 --> 23:08.721
Darryl...

23:08.755 --> 23:09.989
No!
Uh, you know...

23:10.022 --> 23:11.791
Why do you hate me?
What can I do?

23:11.824 --> 23:13.893
Come on. He's sad.
All right.
I know.

23:13.926 --> 23:16.429
Um, Mrs. Hernandez
was trending positive--

23:16.463 --> 23:17.897
I can never tell with her.

23:17.930 --> 23:19.065
And let's see.
Oh, a lot of the people

23:19.098 --> 23:21.133
I handed the flyer to didn't,
like, technically say yes,

23:21.167 --> 23:23.870
but they gave me a look, like,
"Oh, I'm there."
(phone chimes)

23:23.903 --> 23:24.937
Nice!

23:24.971 --> 23:26.138
Yeah. Yeah.
Good for you.

23:26.172 --> 23:29.075
Oh, no.
What?

23:29.108 --> 23:30.443
What?
Is it about the party?

23:30.477 --> 23:31.644
Are people not coming?
Is it Josh?

23:31.678 --> 23:33.780
Is Josh not coming? Wait,
why does Josh have your number?

23:33.813 --> 23:34.981
No, no, it's-it's Tommy, okay?

23:35.014 --> 23:36.849
There's something going on
at the school.

23:36.883 --> 23:38.017
I have to run over...

23:38.050 --> 23:39.218
What?! No, you can't... no,

23:39.251 --> 23:40.720
you can't leave--
the party's in an hour.

23:40.753 --> 23:41.654
This was your idea.

23:41.688 --> 23:43.523
What am I gonna do
if you're not here? I have

23:43.556 --> 23:44.223
no one helping me.
You can't leave

23:44.256 --> 23:46.092
for some stupid child thing!

23:46.125 --> 23:47.694
I'm sorry, that's
really insensitive.

23:47.727 --> 23:48.795
Look, the point is, I get it.

23:48.828 --> 23:49.962
It's your child.
But please come back soon.
Look,

23:49.996 --> 23:52.231
I'm just gonna go, I'm gonna
take care of this hassle,

23:52.264 --> 23:54.634
I'm gonna turn right
back around, okay? I promise

23:54.667 --> 23:57.804
I will be back
soon. Boop.
Liar.

24:04.611 --> 24:07.246
(quietly):
You stole the test?

24:07.279 --> 24:08.815
What? You wanted me
to face my fears,

24:08.848 --> 24:11.117
and I was afraid of getting
a bad grade on my test.

24:11.150 --> 24:12.885
Why weren't you afraid
of getting caught?

24:12.919 --> 24:14.887
Well, I was, but thanks to you,

24:14.921 --> 24:16.723
I overcame that fear.

24:16.756 --> 24:18.725
(door opens)
(exhales)

24:18.758 --> 24:20.459
Mrs. Proctor.

24:23.162 --> 24:25.498
Good luck. He's mean.

24:25.532 --> 24:29.135
(exhales):
Oh, my God.

24:29.168 --> 24:31.237
Let me be frank.

24:31.270 --> 24:32.839
Tommy has every issue
in the book,

24:32.872 --> 24:34.507
so I'm afraid

24:34.541 --> 24:36.042
we're going to have
to transfer him

24:36.075 --> 24:37.777
to a special program
in Riverside.

24:37.810 --> 24:40.246
But that's, like, an hour away!

24:40.279 --> 24:42.649
We moved to this crap town

24:42.682 --> 24:44.784
because of the schools.
I'm sorry,

24:44.817 --> 24:46.519
do you have somewhere
more important to be?

24:46.553 --> 24:48.921
No, of course not. I-I...

24:48.955 --> 24:50.923
The transfer hearing is Monday.

24:50.957 --> 24:53.192
Y... You can't do this.

24:53.225 --> 24:56.629
He's-he's been diagnosed
with so many things.

24:56.663 --> 24:57.730
(stammering)

24:57.764 --> 24:59.298
He just, he needs help.

24:59.331 --> 25:01.901
I'll see you Monday.

25:06.238 --> 25:08.541
*

25:08.575 --> 25:09.275
(sighs)

25:12.612 --> 25:14.714
(doorbell rings)

25:17.116 --> 25:18.618
Hi!

25:18.651 --> 25:20.286
Here's a present.

25:20.319 --> 25:23.556
Those are good until midnight.

25:23.590 --> 25:26.893
(scoffs)
Oh, man! I thought the house

25:26.926 --> 25:29.596
was literally gonna be on fire.

25:33.633 --> 25:35.234
(exhales)

25:35.267 --> 25:38.037
You were right--
he's terrifying.

25:38.070 --> 25:39.105
He made me forget

25:39.138 --> 25:40.773
everything I was gonna say.

25:40.807 --> 25:42.141
Are you mad at me?

25:42.174 --> 25:44.110
You stole a test,
you... ding-dong.

25:44.143 --> 25:45.912
Of course I'm mad at you.

25:47.346 --> 25:48.981
(sighs)

25:49.015 --> 25:50.883
We'll figure something out.

25:50.917 --> 25:52.284
(phone vibrating)

25:53.953 --> 25:56.623
(soft gasp)
Oh.

25:56.656 --> 25:57.924
Okay,

25:57.957 --> 25:59.125
come on, I will
take you home,

25:59.158 --> 26:02.328
but we got to stop
somewhere along the way.

26:11.170 --> 26:12.138
Hey!

26:12.171 --> 26:13.806
I have terrible news.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.274
Josh isn't coming?

26:15.307 --> 26:17.176
No. He's coming...

26:18.177 --> 26:19.746
...to this.

26:19.779 --> 26:22.081
Party like
it's Weekend Tuesday!

26:22.114 --> 26:23.182
Huh?

26:28.821 --> 26:33.059
This. This is what Josh
is going to walk into.

26:33.092 --> 26:34.861
Nobody came.

26:34.894 --> 26:37.930
I handed out all those flyers,
and nobody showed up.

26:37.964 --> 26:39.699
Even Mrs. Hernandez bagged.

26:39.732 --> 26:41.333
What's she doing
on a Friday night?

26:41.367 --> 26:43.035
*

26:49.742 --> 26:52.378
*
(panting)

26:54.213 --> 26:57.416
This is exactly what I thought
was gonna happen.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.185
You were wrong, Paula.

26:59.218 --> 27:01.353
This is exactly how it felt

27:01.387 --> 27:03.255
when my father left.

27:03.289 --> 27:05.024
My life is just about
to fall apart,

27:05.057 --> 27:06.693
just like it did when I was

27:06.726 --> 27:08.427
12 years old.
 When Josh walks in here,

27:08.460 --> 27:10.697
he's gonna walk out

27:10.730 --> 27:13.800
just like my dad did,

27:13.833 --> 27:15.835
and he's never gonna come back.

27:15.868 --> 27:18.070
Don't panic.
How long do we have?
We have 20 minutes.

27:18.104 --> 27:20.206
He texted me that
he would be here in 20 minutes.

27:20.239 --> 27:22.008
I'm gonna, I'm gonna call him,
and I'm gonna say

27:22.041 --> 27:23.342
that the party's canceled--
that's the easy solution.

27:23.375 --> 27:26.212
I'm just gonna say the pa...
No. No, no. Hey, no!
We are not gonna

27:26.245 --> 27:27.947
give in to fear--
we're gonna stand up.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.682
My advice works...

27:29.716 --> 27:32.451
damn it,
and I am gonna prove it.

27:32.484 --> 27:33.352
Where are you going?
I'm gonna be back

27:33.385 --> 27:35.822
in 19 minutes with guests,
lots of 'em.

27:35.855 --> 27:37.456
You just need to do
the best you can

27:37.489 --> 27:40.693
to make it look like
you are having a great time!

27:40.727 --> 27:43.262
CLERK:
Oh, no, no, no,
no offense taken.

27:43.295 --> 27:45.197
A lot of people think
it's a congenital thing,

27:45.231 --> 27:46.198
but actually...
Oh, really?

27:46.232 --> 27:47.399
Oh, yeah.
But actually,

27:47.433 --> 27:49.368
I lit a cigarette
using a gas burner.

27:49.401 --> 27:51.137
So not very smart, right?

27:51.170 --> 27:52.705
Lesson learned.

27:52.739 --> 27:54.406
DARRYL: Oh, that must
have been horrible for you.

27:54.440 --> 27:55.742
CLERK:
Oh, yeah.

27:55.775 --> 27:58.010
The smell alone
was a nightmare.

27:58.044 --> 28:00.947
Okay, party people,
let's all have

28:00.980 --> 28:03.382
a dance party
by the windows!

28:03.415 --> 28:05.785
*

28:05.818 --> 28:07.419
I'm not much of a dancer.
Oh, yeah!

28:07.453 --> 28:08.955
Why the windows?
Whoo!

28:08.988 --> 28:10.923
We are raising the roof
over here!

28:10.957 --> 28:12.291
MAN:
Shut up!

28:12.324 --> 28:14.827
Come over!
No!

28:15.962 --> 28:18.865
TOMMY: Hey, look-- people!
Lots of people!

28:18.898 --> 28:21.433
PAULA: Oh, something anonymous
just got out.

28:21.467 --> 28:24.003
I'll take 'em!

28:24.036 --> 28:25.237
Are you guys drunks?

28:25.271 --> 28:27.206
Gamblers.

28:27.239 --> 28:28.908
Perfect!

28:29.942 --> 28:31.978
Oh! Is that all you got,
you wuss?

28:32.011 --> 28:33.813
Hey, I don't care
for that word.

28:33.846 --> 28:34.947
Oh, wuss, wuss, wuss, wuss.

28:34.981 --> 28:38.084
Hey, Josh, it's me, Rebecca.

28:38.117 --> 28:40.086
Um, so I-I think I had

28:40.119 --> 28:42.088
some of that weird
garbage disposal chicken,

28:42.121 --> 28:44.023
um, and I'm not feeling so hot,

28:44.056 --> 28:45.424
so I've decided
to cancel the party.

28:45.457 --> 28:49.161
I hope that you have a good...
Friday night. Um...

28:50.797 --> 28:52.198
Hi!

28:52.231 --> 28:54.033
Hey!
Hi!

28:54.066 --> 28:55.201
Hi!
Oh. Hey,
what's up?

28:55.234 --> 28:56.869
Hello.
It's so good to see you.

28:56.903 --> 28:58.070
Welcome.
Uh, thanks.

28:58.104 --> 29:00.506
Nice to see you.
Do you want to maybe
Um, yeah, nice to...

29:00.539 --> 29:02.108
go for a walk
around the block?

29:02.141 --> 29:03.910
I have to go get
some cigarettes.

29:03.943 --> 29:05.011
I'm a smoker.

29:05.044 --> 29:07.179
Yeah, big smoker.

29:07.213 --> 29:08.380
Um...

29:08.414 --> 29:09.816
What?

29:09.849 --> 29:11.383
(sighs)

29:11.417 --> 29:13.285
What?

29:13.319 --> 29:14.921
Whoa.

29:14.954 --> 29:17.189
What happened here?

29:21.393 --> 29:23.295
Um...

29:23.329 --> 29:25.164
Okay, so...

29:25.197 --> 29:27.466
it's more of, like,
an intimate soirée...

29:27.499 --> 29:29.301
now, because I
thought that a party

29:29.335 --> 29:31.170
would be too tacky.

29:31.203 --> 29:33.305
(sighs):
Um...

29:33.339 --> 29:35.808
No, that's not what I thought.

29:35.842 --> 29:38.978
Okay, so you know how I, I
wanted to throw this big party?

29:39.011 --> 29:41.147
Uh-huh.
I handed out a ton of flyers...

29:41.180 --> 29:42.481
and nobody came.

29:42.514 --> 29:46.085
Wait. You're upset...
about this?

29:46.118 --> 29:48.254
I threw a party...

29:48.287 --> 29:50.056
and nobody came.

29:50.089 --> 29:51.457
(laughing)

29:51.490 --> 29:53.292
I know, it's hilarious.

29:53.325 --> 29:57.496
Of course! You just moved
into town, you banana.

29:57.529 --> 29:59.365
Of course you don't have
a million friends.

29:59.398 --> 30:01.067
You know, that'd be
weird if you did.

30:01.100 --> 30:03.069
If there had been
a ton of people here,

30:03.102 --> 30:06.105
it would seem like
you just invited random
people you didn't know.

30:06.138 --> 30:08.240
Oh, my God, that'd be so weird.
Yeah, totally.

30:08.274 --> 30:09.608
Don't be sad, Becks.

30:09.641 --> 30:12.344
You have a lot of cool stuff
going on in your life.

30:12.378 --> 30:15.848
Great job, um, sweet
apartment, plus...

30:15.882 --> 30:18.117
you're, like, a
kick-ass career gal.

30:18.150 --> 30:20.619
(chuckles)
Well, I...
I am a prime earner

30:20.652 --> 30:22.588
at Whitefeather already.

30:22.621 --> 30:25.091
Yeah, damn straight you are.
Whatever that is.

30:25.124 --> 30:26.558
I mean, you're
crushing it.

30:26.592 --> 30:27.593
Look at you.

30:27.626 --> 30:30.362
You just moved to town,
you throw a big party.

30:30.396 --> 30:31.998
You're fearless.

30:32.031 --> 30:33.199
Oh.
(chuckles)

30:33.232 --> 30:34.200
I am.

30:34.233 --> 30:35.267
You know, Becks,

30:35.301 --> 30:37.569
if you really wanted more
people at your party,

30:37.603 --> 30:39.605
that's easy-- any
idiot can do that.

30:39.638 --> 30:41.240
(scoffs)

30:41.273 --> 30:42.909
Is... that what you want?

30:44.543 --> 30:46.412
Sweet. Let's do it.

30:46.445 --> 30:48.247
All right, get
over here, guys.
You, Dreads,

30:48.280 --> 30:49.548
over here.
You, Fun Guy,

30:49.581 --> 30:51.283
I need you over-- yeah.

30:51.317 --> 30:53.052
You're gonna wear my shades.
Awesome sauce.

30:53.085 --> 30:54.653
You, Mr. Tall Man,
you stand there.

30:54.686 --> 30:57.489
Okay, now the key to
a good party selfie

30:57.523 --> 31:00.492
is attitude-- what?! Yes!

31:00.526 --> 31:02.028
Swag.

31:02.061 --> 31:03.029
Ooh.

31:03.062 --> 31:04.430
Good.

31:04.463 --> 31:06.432
(laughs)
That's good. Okay, and...

31:06.465 --> 31:07.967
a killer smile.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.301
Ready, guys?
Come on.

31:09.335 --> 31:10.569
Okay. Say-- ready?

31:10.602 --> 31:11.938
Say "selfie."

31:11.971 --> 31:13.039
ALL:
Selfie...!

31:13.072 --> 31:15.074
Ha!

31:15.107 --> 31:17.576
Ha-ha! Then we post
this puppy online.

31:17.609 --> 31:21.247
And write #This house

31:21.280 --> 31:23.515
is on fire!

31:23.549 --> 31:26.185
Exclam-Exclamation point.
Ah... send!

31:26.218 --> 31:27.954
Then we see
what happens.
Huh.

31:27.987 --> 31:29.221
(knocking on door)

31:30.489 --> 31:33.625
Who's ready to party...?!

31:33.659 --> 31:37.063
(shouts, cheers, whoops)

31:37.096 --> 31:38.264
You got dice?

31:38.297 --> 31:41.300
I can find some!
(whoops)

32:01.387 --> 32:04.323
Oh, uh,
this is Arielle

32:04.356 --> 32:06.292
and Chuck.

32:06.325 --> 32:09.128
And this guy!

32:09.161 --> 32:10.662
Hi. What-What's his name?

32:10.696 --> 32:12.564
I don't know, I just
call him "this guy."

32:12.598 --> 32:15.201
I've known him
since kindergarten.

32:15.234 --> 32:18.037
Yeah, I'm just so bad in school.

32:18.070 --> 32:20.439
Dude, let me tell you
something right now.

32:20.472 --> 32:23.509
Being good at school
means nothing.

32:23.542 --> 32:27.246
Like, see her?

32:27.279 --> 32:30.249
Oh, do it, do it!
You got it!

32:30.282 --> 32:32.151
She went to Harvard.

32:32.184 --> 32:33.652
Okay?

32:33.685 --> 32:34.720
And she's a mess.

32:34.753 --> 32:36.155
Yeah.
Dude,

32:36.188 --> 32:37.389
I was horrible at school,

32:37.423 --> 32:40.659
but that's because instead of
reading their stupid books,

32:40.692 --> 32:44.296
I was busy reading everything
Salinger ever wrote.

32:44.330 --> 32:47.099
And you're, like, totally
successful and rich now, right?

32:47.133 --> 32:50.336
Not at all.

32:50.369 --> 32:52.138
But I'm cool,

32:52.171 --> 32:53.639
and that's what
really matters.

32:53.672 --> 32:56.508
I like you.
I like you so...

32:56.542 --> 32:58.010
I, can I-- can I just,

32:58.044 --> 32:59.311
just grab it?
There you go.
It's fine.

32:59.345 --> 33:01.980
It's my personal
boundaries...

33:05.317 --> 33:07.053
We're fine.
I swallowed the barf!

33:07.086 --> 33:09.188
Oh, she swallowed the barf!
I swallowed my barf!

33:09.221 --> 33:12.024
She swallowed the barf!

33:12.058 --> 33:13.792
*

33:13.825 --> 33:16.095
Oh!

33:16.128 --> 33:17.196
Oh! Oh, my God.

33:17.229 --> 33:19.398
You know, at first, I had
my doubts about this party.

33:19.431 --> 33:21.400
I mean, it's no Weekend Tuesday,
you know what I'm saying?

33:21.433 --> 33:23.635
But now?
I mean, this is a blast.

33:23.669 --> 33:25.571
Oh, and I even met
this great girl Megan

33:25.604 --> 33:27.339
who said she found
your flyer in a gutter.

33:27.373 --> 33:29.775
Oh, she's such a good listener.

33:29.808 --> 33:31.577
And I told her
all about my divorce.

33:31.610 --> 33:33.712
But I think she's
from England, because, I mean,

33:33.745 --> 33:35.814
her teeth are not good.
But she gave me

33:35.847 --> 33:37.583
this terrific menthol cigarette.

33:37.616 --> 33:39.218
(inhales)
Mmm.

33:39.251 --> 33:40.486
Um...

33:41.853 --> 33:44.590
I think Megan might
be a meth addict.

33:44.623 --> 33:47.426
Oh, yeah?
I think you maybe
just smoked meth.

33:47.459 --> 33:49.361
Oh. Okay.
Well, you know, that'd explain

33:49.395 --> 33:51.197
why I've been digging a hole
in the backyard

33:51.230 --> 33:53.165
for the last hour.
(laughs) But it's still fun!

33:53.199 --> 33:55.167
Hey, Megan, honey,

33:55.201 --> 33:57.169
let's clean something.
(whoops)

34:00.606 --> 34:03.075
GREG:
Wow.

34:03.109 --> 34:05.344
This party is a real
who's-who of...

34:05.377 --> 34:07.413
who?

34:07.446 --> 34:12.083
Well, if it isn't
Mr. I Can't Come to Your Party

34:12.118 --> 34:15.487
Because I Have a Bunch
of Complicated Reasons,

34:15.521 --> 34:18.257
I Probably Have to Buy
More Black Clothing,

34:18.290 --> 34:19.690
Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah.

34:19.725 --> 34:21.260
That's a long name I have.
Polish?

34:21.293 --> 34:23.094
All right.

34:23.129 --> 34:25.231
Sincerely, thank
you for coming.

34:25.264 --> 34:26.831
It means a lot to me
that you're here.

34:26.864 --> 34:28.367
Well, you took all my customers.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.369
I usually get the gamblers
after their meeting.

34:30.402 --> 34:31.603
Then I started thinking,

34:31.637 --> 34:33.239
"I've got to show up
to this party to see

34:33.272 --> 34:35.574
in what gruesome way
it could all go wrong."

34:35.607 --> 34:38.310
I figured
at least a porch collapse.

34:38.344 --> 34:39.545
But, now that I'm here...

34:40.346 --> 34:42.414
It's not that bad.
Yeah,

34:42.447 --> 34:44.183
it's pretty great, right?

34:44.216 --> 34:47.418
And I have one person
to thank for that.

34:55.161 --> 34:56.527
Hey, girl.

34:56.562 --> 34:58.464
I know that as a kid
you never got to see

34:58.497 --> 35:00.399
that boy band
concert on pay-per-view.

35:00.432 --> 35:01.667
But it's okay.

35:01.700 --> 35:03.502
Because I'm here now.

35:03.535 --> 35:06.272
And I'm all the boy band
you'll ever need.

35:06.305 --> 35:08.274
* Oh, oh, oh, oh *

35:08.307 --> 35:10.676
* Girl, I know things
haven't always *

35:10.709 --> 35:13.612
* Been so easy for you

35:13.645 --> 35:15.781
* Kids were mean
and your daddy *

35:15.814 --> 35:18.884
* Walked right out
the door, too *

35:18.917 --> 35:20.786
* Maybe we should
have a session *

35:20.819 --> 35:23.689
* Address your anxiety
and depression *

35:23.722 --> 35:27.559
* 'Cause I got a funny
feeling if we do *

35:29.728 --> 35:31.697
* Baby, you can

35:31.730 --> 35:35.667
* Kiss all your childhood
traumas good-bye *
(audience shrieking)

35:35.701 --> 35:37.936
* You're never gonna miss

35:37.969 --> 35:39.638
* All that stress you've been

35:39.671 --> 35:41.840
* Keeping inside

35:41.873 --> 35:44.576
* All your
psychological problems *

35:44.610 --> 35:47.246
* Girl, we're gonna solve them

35:47.279 --> 35:48.580
* 'Cause we're not
just a boy band *

35:48.614 --> 35:49.948
* Made up of four Joshes

35:49.981 --> 35:51.717
* We're also a team
of licensed *

35:51.750 --> 35:53.719
* Mental health professionals

35:53.752 --> 35:55.454
* We'll help you

35:55.487 --> 35:57.856
* Understand the reasons

35:57.889 --> 36:00.326
* That your mom made you sad

36:00.359 --> 36:02.461
* And why every man you date

36:02.494 --> 36:05.464
* Is just a stand-in
for your dad *

36:05.497 --> 36:07.733
* You'll stop
revisiting your fears *

36:07.766 --> 36:11.203
* Once we wipe away your tears

36:11.237 --> 36:14.540
* Trust us, girl,
your prognosis isn't bad *

36:14.573 --> 36:16.608
(screams)
* Baby, you can kiss

36:16.642 --> 36:18.777
* All your unexplained

36:18.810 --> 36:21.247
* Symptoms good-bye

36:21.280 --> 36:23.615
* You're never gonna miss
all those nightmares *

36:23.649 --> 36:26.518
* In which you tend to die

36:26.552 --> 36:29.488
* We'll get you through those
developmental stages *

36:29.521 --> 36:30.956
* That you've been
stuck in for ages *

36:30.989 --> 36:32.624
* 'Cause we're not just

36:32.658 --> 36:34.693
* A boy band
made up of four Joshes *

36:34.726 --> 36:36.862
* We're also a team of
nationally recognized *

36:36.895 --> 36:38.764
* Mental health professionals

36:38.797 --> 36:40.866
* Trained in cognitive
behavioral therapy *

36:40.899 --> 36:42.634
* With specialties in

36:42.668 --> 36:44.636
* Personality
and sleep disorders *

36:44.670 --> 36:48.574
* And love.

36:49.975 --> 36:53.011
(Josh speaking indistinctly)

36:53.044 --> 36:55.614
JOSH:
And the guy is like,
"Me, I'm fine.

36:55.647 --> 36:56.715
See that girl
over there?"

36:56.748 --> 36:58.750
(phone dings)

36:59.785 --> 37:01.753
* Everything is A-OK

37:01.787 --> 37:04.823
* So everybody say...

37:08.527 --> 37:09.728
Um...

37:09.761 --> 37:11.930
is everything okay?

37:11.963 --> 37:13.999
Uh... no, it's...

37:14.032 --> 37:15.467
it's-it's not important.

37:15.501 --> 37:17.403
I-I can get back to them later.

37:17.436 --> 37:19.705
I am having a blast right now.

37:19.738 --> 37:21.640
Great.
Yeah.

37:21.673 --> 37:23.942
Great.
So...

37:23.975 --> 37:25.577
I should go.

37:25.611 --> 37:27.713
Tommy just
called us an Uber.

37:27.746 --> 37:30.416
'Cause I am... wuz-asted.

37:30.449 --> 37:32.951
Which is a word I just learned

37:32.984 --> 37:35.987
playing pai gow
with a charming man

37:36.021 --> 37:37.523
from Azusa.

37:37.556 --> 37:39.958
Boop.
(laughs)

37:39.991 --> 37:42.528
You threw a great party.

37:42.561 --> 37:45.564
No.
We threw a great party.

37:45.597 --> 37:47.032
(both grunt)

37:47.065 --> 37:48.700
And you--

37:48.734 --> 37:51.370
you are a brave little cookie.

37:53.572 --> 37:57.376
Okay. Come on. Show Mommy
where the front door is.

37:57.409 --> 37:59.378
CLERK:
Hey, so,

37:59.411 --> 38:00.912
thanks for the party.
Real fun.

38:00.946 --> 38:04.316
And I'll see you
at the store, Betsy.

38:04.350 --> 38:06.452
Actually, my name is Rebecca.

38:06.485 --> 38:07.753
Don't care.

38:10.922 --> 38:12.691
Hey, um...

38:12.724 --> 38:14.560
I saw that you got

38:14.593 --> 38:15.927
a text from Valencia earlier.

38:15.961 --> 38:17.729
I hope I'm not causing
any problems.

38:17.763 --> 38:19.331
No, no, no, no.
I realized,

38:19.365 --> 38:21.567
you know, I-I shouldn't
have listened to her.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.869
I shouldn't be afraid
of my girlfriend, right?

38:23.902 --> 38:24.970
So I told her,

38:25.003 --> 38:28.440
"I'll-I'll come home
when I want to."

38:28.474 --> 38:31.042
Actually, it was a little scary.

38:31.076 --> 38:34.480
Yeah. Actually, you know,
I-I faced a fear earlier

38:34.513 --> 38:36.882
and it turned out pretty okay.

38:36.915 --> 38:39.385
You know, from now on,
uh, since we're friends,

38:39.418 --> 38:41.387
we should just, you know,
hang out

38:41.420 --> 38:42.854
whenever we want to,
don't you think?

38:42.888 --> 38:45.424
Yeah. That...

38:45.457 --> 38:47.759
I mean, yeah. Let's do it.

38:48.827 --> 38:50.862
The world be damned.
All right, yeah.

38:50.896 --> 38:52.731
Wha... It's just...

38:54.400 --> 38:55.767
Well, I got to go.
Yeah, yeah,

38:55.801 --> 38:56.768
let's get you out of
here. I'll-I'll...

38:56.802 --> 38:58.670
don't worry about that.

38:58.704 --> 39:00.906
Oh. It was a great party.

39:00.939 --> 39:03.542
Thanks. Thank you.

39:03.575 --> 39:06.011
This house was on fire!
Oh!

39:06.044 --> 39:08.079
(laughs)
Yeah!
Oh, I get it. Oh.

39:11.417 --> 39:12.951
Later.

39:12.984 --> 39:14.786
Later.

39:14.820 --> 39:16.822
Sooner rather than... (laughs)

39:20.559 --> 39:22.060
(door closes)
Uh, hi.

39:22.093 --> 39:23.795
I didn't know
you were still here.

39:23.829 --> 39:25.431
I thought you already left.

39:25.464 --> 39:28.434
(chuckles) Oh, I don't leave
when there's whiskey left.

39:28.467 --> 39:29.668
Oh.

39:29.701 --> 39:31.002
Hey, you know what?

39:31.036 --> 39:32.003
Take it home.

39:32.037 --> 39:33.539
That's my gift to you.

39:33.572 --> 39:35.073
Thank you.

39:35.106 --> 39:36.542
You know, I get it now.

39:36.575 --> 39:37.776
What do you get?

39:37.809 --> 39:39.678
How you feel about Josh.

39:39.711 --> 39:41.413
I saw it on
your face.

39:41.447 --> 39:43.815
It was weird
and sad and...

39:43.849 --> 39:46.117
also kind of beautiful

39:46.151 --> 39:49.455
in a pure and unironic way.

39:51.022 --> 39:52.591
I don't know
what you're talking about.

39:52.624 --> 39:53.992
Josh and I are just friends.

39:54.025 --> 39:55.827
You guys are just friends.

39:55.861 --> 39:57.596
We guys are just friends.

39:57.629 --> 39:59.130
Everyone guys are just friends.

39:59.164 --> 40:01.066
Okay, okay.

40:01.099 --> 40:02.468
Drunkie.
Drunkie.

40:02.501 --> 40:04.703
Let's call you-- whoa!

40:04.736 --> 40:07.606
Let's get
a ridesharing service, right?

40:07.639 --> 40:09.941
You know, you're really
starting to fit in here.

40:09.975 --> 40:11.109
Thank you.

40:11.142 --> 40:13.144
That's not a compliment.

40:16.715 --> 40:18.517
I can't do this.

40:18.550 --> 40:21.019
Yes, you can. And I'll be
right here, I promise.

40:21.052 --> 40:22.954
What if I forget all the stuff
I'm supposed to say?

40:29.961 --> 40:32.063
You are not kicking Tommy out.

40:32.097 --> 40:33.832
I know what
my rights are.

40:33.865 --> 40:35.867
'Cause I looked 'em up.

40:35.901 --> 40:39.871
And there is a statute
and it is called...

40:39.905 --> 40:43.208
the fair access rule.

40:43.241 --> 40:46.945
And if you expel Tommy,
then you are...

40:46.978 --> 40:48.680
liable for a

40:48.714 --> 40:52.584
$26,000-per year stipend

40:52.618 --> 40:56.254
for... special education.

40:56.287 --> 41:00.225
If you drop the
transfer hearing,

41:00.258 --> 41:03.795
then... I will let you
off the hook.

41:03.829 --> 41:05.631
See,

41:05.664 --> 41:07.733
this is your problem:

41:10.268 --> 41:13.772
I'm not afraid of you anymore.

41:13.805 --> 41:15.273
(laughs)

41:15.306 --> 41:17.943
That is right.

41:17.976 --> 41:20.111
(knocks)

41:26.718 --> 41:28.019
YOUNG REBECCA:
 That went well.

41:28.053 --> 41:30.188
Much better
than I thought.

41:30.221 --> 41:33.091
So tell me some other
stuff about my future.

41:33.124 --> 41:36.194
Okay, so you're gonna
go to Harvard and Yale.

41:36.227 --> 41:39.631
Yeah, yeah, so when exactly
do I get those boobs?

41:39.665 --> 41:42.934
Oh. Um, I think age 14?

41:42.968 --> 41:44.770
I see.

41:44.803 --> 41:46.838
So, at Yale, you're
gonna be editor in chief

41:46.872 --> 41:47.873
of the law journal.

41:47.906 --> 41:50.241
Sounds great. Back to
the boobs for a second,

41:50.275 --> 41:51.577
when you say 14,

41:51.610 --> 41:54.112
are we talking by
my birthday party?

41:54.145 --> 41:57.248
Are we talking
swimsuit season?

41:57.282 --> 41:59.117
Also, do they float?

41:59.150 --> 42:01.219
Yeah.
Nice! Girl with Mustache
owes me ten dollars.
