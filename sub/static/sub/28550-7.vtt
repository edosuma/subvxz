Masking my scent.
Do you know anything?

11:44.120 --> 11:46.250
Go Go, come on.

11:46.250 --> 11:48.250
I'm already
freezing and wet.

11:48.250 --> 11:50.120
There is absolutely no way--

11:50.750 --> 11:53.920
Okay, I'll just take
those leaves, now.
Thank you.

11:54.250 --> 11:57.120
-(howling)

(Habigon sniffing)

12:38.380 --> 12:40.290
(growls)

12:41.330 --> 12:44.170
What have we learned
about masking our scent?

12:44.170 --> 12:46.120
(puffs)

12:47.290 --> 12:49.210
I think we lost--

12:49.210 --> 12:52.080
(yells):
Mochi!

12:52.080 --> 12:54.420
Mochi! Where are you,
Mochi?

12:54.420 --> 12:59.250
-Baymax: Here, kitty, kitty.
-Mini-Max: Show yourself,
calamitous cat!

12:59.250 --> 13:02.210
If we don't find Mochi,
Aunt Cass is gonna freak!

13:02.210 --> 13:06.330
Wait, wait!
Maybe we can dress up
Mini-Max in a cat costume!

13:06.330 --> 13:10.330
-How's your purring?
-Mini-Maximum cat impression!

13:10.330 --> 13:12.170
Purr, purr!

13:12.170 --> 13:16.000
In the name
of all that is cute. Purr!

13:16.000 --> 13:19.210
Hmm. She might not buy it.

13:19.210 --> 13:22.170
Ooh. Hey, Baymax.
You can scan for
things and stuff.

13:22.170 --> 13:26.170
Yes. I can scan
for many things,
and also... stuff.

13:26.170 --> 13:28.330
So, why haven't
we scanned for Mochi yet?

13:28.330 --> 13:31.170
Scanning for Mochi.

13:34.210 --> 13:37.080
Mochi is over there.

13:39.120 --> 13:41.250
-Mochi!
-Mini-Max: I will get him!

13:41.250 --> 13:44.040
-(clattering)
-(meowing)

13:46.380 --> 13:48.210
Baymax:
A fall from that height
would be hazardous.

13:48.210 --> 13:51.380
Hop on down, Mochi!
Pretty sure I gotcha!

13:51.380 --> 13:53.290
(meows)

13:57.080 --> 13:58.210
(Mochi meows)

13:58.210 --> 14:01.210
Well, then, I guess
there's only one choice.

14:01.210 --> 14:04.040
Mini-Max:
I shall ready my
furry disguise!

14:04.040 --> 14:06.380
Actually,
what I meant was...

14:06.380 --> 14:08.380
(signal beeping)

14:08.380 --> 14:10.120
-Can you walk?
-Ow!

14:10.120 --> 14:12.210
My ankle's
messed up.

14:12.210 --> 14:13.380
What are you doing?

14:13.380 --> 14:16.080
(muttering)

14:16.580 --> 14:19.330
Krei:
The sheep goes in the hole
and back around...

14:19.330 --> 14:22.290
and there we are.
Ta-da!

14:24.290 --> 14:26.120
It's a... ?

14:26.120 --> 14:28.250
It's a walking boot
that I made just now.
Whatever.

14:28.250 --> 14:30.080
Put it on.

14:32.120 --> 14:34.080
(grunts)

14:37.580 --> 14:40.080
That's actually not bad.

14:44.080 --> 14:45.080
Thanks.

14:46.330 --> 14:48.460
How do you know
all this stuff?

14:48.460 --> 14:50.420
Every summer,
when I was home
from boarding school,

14:50.420 --> 14:52.460
my parents would ship me off
to Fire Scout camp.

14:52.460 --> 14:55.420
Who's a Fire Scout?
I'm a Fire Scout.
Fire!

14:55.420 --> 14:57.460
I didn't really have
any friends there,

14:57.460 --> 14:59.620
so I spent most of my time
in nature, by myself.

14:59.620 --> 15:02.120
I guess it's why I still
love it out here

15:02.120 --> 15:04.290
and don't mind that
I don't have any friends.

15:04.290 --> 15:05.540
Single tear.

15:05.540 --> 15:07.460

15:07.460 --> 15:10.460
"Everything is fine,
and Mochi isn't lost."

15:10.460 --> 15:13.460
-Aw, great.
-Wait. You got a text out here?

15:13.460 --> 15:16.170
-It's working.
-Mine, too.

15:16.170 --> 15:19.460
-So, what happened
to Bessie, then?
-(distant roaring)

15:19.460 --> 15:21.460
-Uh-Oh.

15:22.500 --> 15:24.290

15:24.290 --> 15:26.380

15:27.460 --> 15:31.120
-Do you guys trust me?
-Is now really the time?

15:31.120 --> 15:32.460
-(roaring)
-(all exclaim)

15:32.460 --> 15:35.460
-Do you guys trust me?
-Fine. Yes.

15:35.460 --> 15:37.540
-Thank you.
That means a lot to me.
-(distant howling)

15:37.540 --> 15:41.170
Also, there was a "trust me"
clause in your contract.
You should read those.

15:41.170 --> 15:45.170
-(howling)
-For the record,
I didn't say I trusted him.

our car would work, too.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.170
Told you to trust me.

16:12.250 --> 16:15.330

I trusted you.
-Um, thank you, Ga Ga.

Wow. That's really
