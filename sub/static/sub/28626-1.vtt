WEBVTT

01:09.944 --> 01:10.945
Aah.

02:08.877 --> 02:10.170
Aah.

05:11.686 --> 05:13.354
- Hi. Good morning.
- Good morning.

05:13.438 --> 05:15.231
I'll finish this up.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.775
I'm heading out, anyway.
I have to meet up with Leo.

05:17.859 --> 05:21.195
- Have breakfast first.
- Mm.

05:21.279 --> 05:24.198
The t-shirt suppliers are coming in early.
Leo might get overwhelmed.

05:24.282 --> 05:27.744
I have to check the restaurant
for the meet-and-greet with the governor.

05:29.037 --> 05:32.415
If I were you, I'd let Leo handle it.

05:32.498 --> 05:35.543
He's the public official, not you.
Let him learn.

05:36.878 --> 05:41.132
But this isn't just for Leo.
This event is important for me, too.

05:41.215 --> 05:43.551
I truly believe the governor
is the hope of this nation.

05:43.634 --> 05:48.056
Whoever the hope of the nation may be,
I'm sure they're having breakfast now.

05:50.475 --> 05:51.851
So you should, too.

05:52.894 --> 05:54.729
Plus, you shouldn't get too involved.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.149
These politicians, they're all the same.

05:58.900 --> 05:59.901
That's fake news.

06:00.860 --> 06:01.861
About Villanueva?

06:02.820 --> 06:03.863
I hope so.

06:06.532 --> 06:07.533
Hi, baby.

06:08.910 --> 06:10.953
Hi, baby. How was your sleep? Hmm?

06:11.746 --> 06:12.746
Baby...

06:13.748 --> 06:16.834
I know a most-important meal of the day.

06:17.001 --> 06:18.002
Breakfast.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.429
<i>- Governor, may I ask a question?
- Yes.</i>

06:28.513 --> 06:30.890
<i>We know you're running
an anti-drug campaign this election,</i>

06:30.973 --> 06:33.601
<i>but is it true that Mr. De La Vega
is your business partner,</i>

06:33.684 --> 06:36.604
<i>the one suspected to be one of the biggest
drug suppliers in the country?</i>

06:36.687 --> 06:40.191
<i>We are not partners. Period.</i>

06:40.274 --> 06:42.693
<i>Once I'm elected,</i>

06:42.777 --> 06:46.739
<i>I will make sure that the De La Vegas
face the justice they deserve...</i>

06:46.823 --> 06:51.202
You monkey! You wouldn't be
in your position, if not for me.

06:54.205 --> 06:56.416
Boss, I have a present for you.

07:10.638 --> 07:13.224
Boss, here is the present I mentioned.

07:22.942 --> 07:25.445
Boss, have mercy on us.

07:25.528 --> 07:26.612
Please have mercy.

07:27.947 --> 07:32.702
You two traitors, you've got balls.
I'll give you that.

07:33.619 --> 07:35.580
But what I really want to know is...

07:36.873 --> 07:40.084
who's the real traitor?

07:40.168 --> 07:42.378
That's right. It's the end for you two.

07:45.214 --> 07:48.718
Look at these two... Kaleb and Victor.

07:48.801 --> 07:52.305
Always at each other's necks.
Complete opposites.

07:52.388 --> 07:54.265
But one thing they have in common...

07:56.476 --> 07:59.228
they have loyalty.

07:59.937 --> 08:02.482
Right. We need loyalty.

08:04.358 --> 08:07.570
Loyalty? You backstabbing son of a bitch!

08:11.574 --> 08:13.993
You thought I wouldn't find out? Huh?

08:20.666 --> 08:21.667
You two.

08:23.169 --> 08:24.170
Girls.

08:24.879 --> 08:27.006
Boss, we gave you the names.

08:32.428 --> 08:35.640
Okay. Let's get down to business.

08:35.722 --> 08:39.559
Let's talk about Governor Villanueva.
This guy talks too much.

08:40.352 --> 08:44.774
He's making too much noise.
It's making our clients nervous.

08:44.857 --> 08:47.527
So, we've got to shut him up.

08:47.610 --> 08:50.613
- We need to do this now.
- Easier said than done.

08:50.696 --> 08:53.866
If you'll allow me, I can bring my men
there right now and take care of this.

08:53.950 --> 08:56.911
Handle it? Handle it the way
that you handled Santiago?

08:57.119 --> 08:58.829
Listen, asshole,
I completed the mission.

08:59.580 --> 09:02.291
Kaleb, are you fucking serious, man?
Are you that dumb?

09:02.375 --> 09:05.127
We're all under investigation
because of you.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.921
- You fucked up again...
- Sir.

09:09.715 --> 09:11.759
- Okay.
- Thank you, sir.

09:12.510 --> 09:15.930
Hey. Now make sure...

09:16.806 --> 09:20.184
that you take care of
those crawling snakes.

09:20.268 --> 09:21.727
I want heads cut.

09:22.645 --> 09:23.646
Okay?

09:32.029 --> 09:33.030
Why?

09:36.492 --> 09:37.910
What do you mean why?

09:37.994 --> 09:40.830
Why do you let Kaleb go all around
just to fuck shit up?

09:40.913 --> 09:43.374
Then I have to go out there
and clean his mess up.

09:46.752 --> 09:48.671
Victor, Victor...

09:50.047 --> 09:52.967
In this world, everybody has a place.

09:53.801 --> 09:58.222
And in this family, I call the shots.

09:59.098 --> 10:00.182
Do you understand me?

10:01.100 --> 10:04.937
I want to hear it one last time.
Do you understand me?

10:07.648 --> 10:08.649
Yes.

10:32.256 --> 10:34.759
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

10:38.137 --> 10:39.138
Oh, baby, buckle up.

10:41.349 --> 10:42.892
- Ready?
- Yes, Mom.

10:47.146 --> 10:48.689
Mommy, look.

10:48.773 --> 10:51.567
Wow. My baby's really smart.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.194
You got that from me.

10:55.446 --> 10:58.407
Hi, hon.
I just picked up Min-Min from school.

10:59.033 --> 11:01.118
- Hi, Daddy.
<i>- Hello, baby.</i>

11:01.202 --> 11:03.442
<i>Did you have fun in school?
Tell me about it later, okay?</i>

11:03.496 --> 11:07.041
We're heading home. Go home early, please?

11:07.124 --> 11:09.269
<i>Yes, hon. I'm fixing a few things
here at the campaign.</i>

11:09.293 --> 11:11.962
<i>Then I'll be on my way home.
Drive safe, okay.</i>

11:12.046 --> 11:13.047
<i>I love you.</i>

11:13.130 --> 11:14.882
I love you, too. Bye.

11:23.474 --> 11:24.558
Mmm.

11:26.185 --> 11:27.186
Yum.

11:27.269 --> 11:29.063
Yum.

11:29.146 --> 11:32.566
Really?
You guys are really alike.

11:32.650 --> 11:36.445
- Mommy, it's really good.
- Both of you are always pulling my leg.

11:36.529 --> 11:37.697
It's good, right?

11:39.699 --> 11:42.243
<i>Governor,
can you say that the allegations</i>

11:42.326 --> 11:45.037
<i>that you're connected to the De La Vegas
are all fake news?</i>

11:45.121 --> 11:47.373
<i>Of course.
But let me ask you this...</i>

11:48.040 --> 11:50.584
<i>why is the media
sensationalizing the De La Vegas?</i>

11:50.668 --> 11:54.547
They're just making him look bad.
You know, I still believe he's a good guy.

11:55.256 --> 11:56.966
He's the hope of the nation.

12:04.473 --> 12:06.892
Hey. What's with the face?

12:09.979 --> 12:10.980
What face?

12:12.148 --> 12:14.024
You're frowning.

12:14.900 --> 12:15.901
You look irritated.

12:17.903 --> 12:19.655
This is how I always look.

12:20.948 --> 12:21.949
Really?

12:24.535 --> 12:27.371
Through all our years together,
you still don't know me?

12:28.122 --> 12:29.123
Yeah, right.

12:30.374 --> 12:31.584
You know what?

12:32.418 --> 12:35.254
Now that I think about it,
the governor is truly inspiring.

12:35.337 --> 12:37.757
I really believe
in what he's fighting for.

12:38.549 --> 12:41.260
He is really
the only hope of our nation.

12:45.514 --> 12:48.559
Whatever.
I'm just gonna take Min-Min upstairs.

12:48.642 --> 12:50.060
Hey.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.148
Lighten up. I'm just kidding.

13:11.373 --> 13:12.958
Security's tight.

13:14.126 --> 13:17.004
There are eight in plain clothing
just outside the restaurant.

13:17.087 --> 13:18.088
Hey, uncle.

13:19.215 --> 13:20.966
- Leo.
- I'll go ahead.

13:21.842 --> 13:25.262
Hi, auntie.
Thank you so much for coming.

13:29.099 --> 13:31.519
Hey, uncle, you ready?

13:31.602 --> 13:34.021
Of course.
How about you? You're nervous, huh?

13:34.104 --> 13:36.398
Not really.
I think you're the one that's nervous.

13:36.941 --> 13:38.692
Me?

13:38.776 --> 13:40.569
Hey, mister, what's that?

13:40.653 --> 13:42.029
- Baby...
- Ah, this?

13:42.780 --> 13:44.907
Didn't I tell you to stay close to me?

13:44.990 --> 13:48.911
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. I'm so sorry, officer.

13:48.994 --> 13:50.579
It's no problem at all.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.794
Babe, we're just going to go around
for a bit.

13:56.877 --> 13:57.711
Okay.

13:57.795 --> 14:00.589
You can just wait here
for your governor.

14:00.673 --> 14:01.590
Okay.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.718
- See you later.
- Thank you. See you later. Bye-bye, baby.

14:04.802 --> 14:05.802
Bye, auntie. Bye.

14:31.912 --> 14:34.290
Do you just want to go and eat at home?

14:40.880 --> 14:41.881
Hmm.

14:43.299 --> 14:45.676
- <i>This time, play it quietly.</i>
- Yes, sir.

14:45.759 --> 14:48.762
<i>I'll be going out of the country soon
with our partners.</i>

14:48.846 --> 14:51.599
<i>Once you're done with the governor,
head back.</i>

14:51.682 --> 14:52.683
Copy that.

14:54.643 --> 14:55.644
Sir.

15:20.502 --> 15:22.087
Out of the way.

15:22.171 --> 15:25.257
- Watch it.
- Where is she?

15:25.341 --> 15:27.760
- Who, sir?
- Her! Where is she?

15:29.803 --> 15:30.804
She just left.

15:34.099 --> 15:37.186
- Circle the area, all right? Find her.
- Yes, sir. Let's go.

15:42.399 --> 15:46.362
<i>We have to now look at laws
that will make sure that the government...</i>

15:46.445 --> 15:50.991
<i>the government
will not spend money uselessly.</i>

15:51.075 --> 15:52.660
<i>That we promise you.</i>

15:52.743 --> 15:56.747
<i>Believe that the government now,
if you put me there,</i>

15:56.830 --> 16:00.167
<i>will be behind you all the way
to help the small businesses.</i>

16:00.250 --> 16:04.838
<i>But... it's only up to all of us.
It's only up to all of you.</i>

16:04.922 --> 16:06.340
<i>So, my friends,</i>

16:06.423 --> 16:08.592
<i>please don't forget this coming election...</i>

16:09.593 --> 16:11.261
I was watching that.

16:11.345 --> 16:13.806
All you think about is the governor.

16:13.889 --> 16:16.475
You're already wearing his face
and did your part to support him.

16:16.558 --> 16:18.519
Isn't that enough?

16:19.561 --> 16:22.439
Is it wrong
to support an honest politician?

16:22.523 --> 16:26.568
- He is the hope of the nation...
- Hope of the nation. I already know.

16:26.652 --> 16:29.029
That's all I hear from you.

16:29.113 --> 16:31.699
- And then what's the problem?
- Nothing.

16:31.782 --> 16:32.782
Nothing at all.

16:33.534 --> 16:38.163
It's just that
you've paid him more attention

16:38.247 --> 16:41.583
than your own family.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.460
I just want to help him win.

16:43.544 --> 16:45.963
By neglecting me and Min-Min?

16:48.298 --> 16:49.299
Ach.

17:07.276 --> 17:08.569
Please don't.

17:09.444 --> 17:10.444
Don't hurt me.

17:18.412 --> 17:19.413
Stop.

17:26.670 --> 17:28.881
Please. Please have mercy on me.

17:33.218 --> 17:35.429
- <i>What do you want?</i>
- Status?

17:36.722 --> 17:38.098
Who are you to question me?

17:42.061 --> 17:44.897
Just trying to help.
I'll send some men over.

17:46.523 --> 17:47.691
<i>Expect them tomorrow.</i>

17:47.816 --> 17:49.818
Listen, I didn't ask for your help,
you asshole!

17:52.613 --> 17:53.655
Fuck!

17:55.866 --> 17:56.866
Hit him again.

18:03.665 --> 18:04.666
Stop.

18:07.544 --> 18:08.545
Look what you did.

18:10.506 --> 18:11.840
He's fuckin' passed out.

18:14.593 --> 18:15.594
Fuckin' monkey.

18:23.185 --> 18:24.228
Sorry about that.

18:26.814 --> 18:28.065
Can you wake up for me?

18:28.857 --> 18:29.858
Can you wake up?

18:31.110 --> 18:33.362
Wake up!

18:35.239 --> 18:36.240
Listen.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.576
No matter what you say...

18:41.120 --> 18:42.955
it doesn't fuckin' matter, okay.

18:45.582 --> 18:47.084
This whole thing...

18:48.210 --> 18:49.211
it's a big show.

18:51.880 --> 18:54.758
I'm gonna tell you what
I'm gonna do next, all right?

18:54.842 --> 18:56.343
I'm gonna take that stick...

18:58.428 --> 19:01.140
and I'm gonna shove it
right up your ass.

19:10.816 --> 19:11.900
Here we go.

19:19.783 --> 19:22.744
Holy fuckin' shit!

19:22.828 --> 19:24.121
Victor!

19:26.498 --> 19:28.417
I told you...

19:29.501 --> 19:31.670
to eliminate the snake.

19:34.298 --> 19:35.674
Has he given a name?

19:39.261 --> 19:41.430
I want a name.

19:46.768 --> 19:48.937
Nope. No name, sir.

20:03.660 --> 20:04.661
Unh.

20:06.330 --> 20:07.581
Hit harder!

20:29.019 --> 20:32.105
- I don't want this anymore.
- What? Us?

20:35.234 --> 20:36.235
No.

20:37.402 --> 20:38.403
The killings.

20:41.823 --> 20:43.367
I don't want to kill anymore.

20:45.827 --> 20:49.081
You know it's part of our lives,
something we can't escape.

20:51.208 --> 20:52.209
Especially you.

20:59.341 --> 21:01.760
Look. Tell you what...

21:02.386 --> 21:04.263
we have one more mission left.

21:04.346 --> 21:05.514
After that, I promise.

21:06.723 --> 21:07.724
I'll talk to him.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.103
Okay?

21:14.273 --> 21:15.274
You know I love you.

21:37.796 --> 21:38.839
Aah.

22:05.615 --> 22:07.075
Clean up this fuckin' mess.

22:36.521 --> 22:38.190
I'm not going anymore.

22:41.443 --> 22:43.528
I was thinking about
what you said yesterday.

22:45.572 --> 22:46.573
So today...

22:48.075 --> 22:49.076
it's family time.

22:54.164 --> 22:57.042
I was also thinking about
what you said yesterday.

22:57.793 --> 22:58.877
Because of me...

23:00.253 --> 23:02.506
you weren't able to meet the governor...

23:03.882 --> 23:05.884
and I know how important
that was for you.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.136
So to make it up to you...

23:09.471 --> 23:11.390
I'm going to cook us a special dinner.

23:12.641 --> 23:13.642
So we're good?

23:36.790 --> 23:39.459
All right. I'm only gonna say this once.

23:40.293 --> 23:42.254
I don't care if Victor sent you.

23:42.337 --> 23:45.257
If you're here,
that means you take orders from me.

23:46.383 --> 23:47.592
Got it?

23:48.844 --> 23:49.845
All right, good.

23:51.471 --> 23:53.932
The governor will be leaving today
for his next venue.

23:54.558 --> 23:56.935
Miru, I want you to take five men.

23:57.561 --> 24:00.272
You tail the governor.
If there's an opening, you take it.

24:01.481 --> 24:03.066
- Sir?
- Something more important

24:03.150 --> 24:06.319
has come to my attention
that I need to resolve immediately.

24:06.403 --> 24:08.989
So me and the remaining men
will be handling that first.

24:10.907 --> 24:13.118
- Is that understood?
- But, sir...

24:15.871 --> 24:16.997
Do as I say, Miru.

24:18.290 --> 24:19.291
Copy.

24:21.042 --> 24:22.043
All right.

24:23.086 --> 24:24.838
For those who are staying...

24:24.921 --> 24:28.049
I forwarded a picture of a woman,
two men, and a child to each of you.

24:28.800 --> 24:31.386
Remember their faces.
The mission is simple.

24:32.387 --> 24:34.848
You find them, you bring them to me.

24:35.765 --> 24:38.351
I will not tolerate any fuck-ups
on this job.

24:45.609 --> 24:47.402
What the fuck you all standing around for?

24:47.486 --> 24:48.570
Go.

24:53.408 --> 24:55.202
I want you to keep an eye on them, huh?

24:56.912 --> 24:58.663
I don't trust that fuckin' Victor.

25:05.462 --> 25:09.090
You can really see that
our campaign's gonna turn out great.

25:09.174 --> 25:11.468
Your uncle's amazing
with all his help.

25:11.551 --> 25:15.555
- Yeah, I know.
- What help would you need for tomorrow?

25:15.639 --> 25:17.516
What's our schedule tomorrow?

25:17.599 --> 25:19.479
- Do we need to do anything else?
- Maybe the...

25:22.395 --> 25:24.898
- Nobody move! We need him.
- Move back!

25:25.899 --> 25:26.900
Don't follow us.

25:50.549 --> 25:51.550
Tank.

25:52.300 --> 25:53.718
That's enough.

26:10.193 --> 26:13.822
- Tsk tsk tsk tsk.
- What did I do wrong?

26:16.533 --> 26:17.742
Have mercy.

26:19.286 --> 26:20.286
Please.

26:22.247 --> 26:26.167
I apologize
for the inconvenience. I do.

26:28.545 --> 26:29.838
I know you must be tired.

26:31.840 --> 26:34.843
But I just have to make sure
I get everything I need from you.

26:36.595 --> 26:41.224
Anything. I'll do anything.
Please just let me go.

26:41.349 --> 26:45.186
I don't want any more. No more.

26:46.062 --> 26:47.063
Please.

26:47.731 --> 26:48.732
No more.

26:53.278 --> 26:54.279
I know.

26:55.739 --> 26:58.450
No. Don't! Don't! Don't!

26:58.533 --> 26:59.659
Don't! Aah!

27:08.084 --> 27:09.669
No more!

27:09.753 --> 27:12.464
- Shh.
- No more!

27:12.631 --> 27:14.758
- No more!
- Quiet. Just stay quiet.

27:14.841 --> 27:17.093
I don't want any more!

27:17.177 --> 27:19.929
Please, no more!

27:22.557 --> 27:23.725
You're almost done.

27:30.106 --> 27:33.234
- This one's my favorite.
- No! Don't!

27:33.318 --> 27:35.320
I'll do anything!

28:49.352 --> 28:50.478
Follow her.

28:51.521 --> 28:52.564
There!

30:10.475 --> 30:13.269
You had her, and you let her fuckin' go!

30:15.605 --> 30:18.942
This woman is more dangerous
than all of you combined!

30:21.277 --> 30:23.279
Let these fuckin' morons be an example.

30:24.656 --> 30:26.491
You take caution!

30:31.120 --> 30:33.581
Listen up. I lead...

30:34.833 --> 30:35.834
you follow.

30:42.757 --> 30:43.842
Bert!

30:45.260 --> 30:47.428
Min-Min, Bert, we need to go.

30:47.512 --> 30:50.306
- What? Wait. Wait. Maria.
- Take only the important things.

30:50.390 --> 30:51.391
We need to pack.

30:54.477 --> 30:56.479
- Hurry! I'm sorry, baby!
- Mommy!

30:57.605 --> 31:00.316
Hey! What's going on?
You're scaring Min-Min!

31:00.400 --> 31:02.819
- Maria, explain to me what's going on.
- Bert.

31:02.902 --> 31:04.487
You're scaring her!

31:04.612 --> 31:06.865
Don't ask. Please just do what I tell you!

31:06.948 --> 31:10.285
Explain to me what's going on first!
Slow down! Calm down!

31:10.368 --> 31:12.495
There's no time!
Please, we have to go now!

31:14.247 --> 31:17.292
Baby, it's okay. It's okay.
Mommy's here, okay.

31:17.375 --> 31:19.711
Mommy's here. Don't cry. Don't cry...

31:23.131 --> 31:24.799
Bert, please.

31:30.763 --> 31:33.099
I'm sorry.

31:36.561 --> 31:37.604
Who the hell are you?

31:39.105 --> 31:40.315
Mommy!

31:44.235 --> 31:45.778
- What do you want?
- I want her.

31:45.862 --> 31:47.238
- Who are...
- Drop the gun, Lily!

31:47.322 --> 31:49.699
- Lily? Who's Lily?
- You know me.

31:49.782 --> 31:50.950
Drop it!

31:53.286 --> 31:56.247
- Just leave them out of this.
- Put the fuckin' gun down, Lily!

31:56.331 --> 31:58.625
- Put it down!
- Mommy!

32:05.798 --> 32:08.384
Mommy. Mommy.

32:08.468 --> 32:10.887
Mommy. Mommy.

32:10.970 --> 32:13.681
Leave my family alone!
Don't touch them!

32:15.934 --> 32:17.018
- Daddy.
- Min-Min.

32:18.269 --> 32:19.479
Min-Min!

32:19.562 --> 32:21.397
Aah!

32:22.815 --> 32:24.108
Min-Min!

32:30.531 --> 32:31.991
Now you know how it feels.

32:41.209 --> 32:42.251
Lily, finish it.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.713
They're not the target.

32:45.797 --> 32:46.798
You.

32:57.183 --> 33:00.395
No matter where you go,
I'll find you, Lily. You hear me?

33:00.478 --> 33:01.479
You can't hide!

33:02.563 --> 33:04.190
Min-Min.

33:05.149 --> 33:07.151
- This is your fault, Lily.
- Min-Min!

33:40.309 --> 33:41.602
Maria, behind you!

34:50.420 --> 34:52.757
<i>What's the status? Is it done?</i>

34:52.840 --> 34:55.510
- We got bigger problems in our hands.
- <i>What's going on?</i>

34:56.511 --> 34:57.595
Everyone's dead.

34:58.346 --> 35:00.056
<i>What do you mean, everybody's dead?</i>

35:02.391 --> 35:04.977
- She's still alive.
- <i>Who's she?</i>

35:05.895 --> 35:08.106
Lily. Lily's still alive!

35:22.203 --> 35:23.204
Min!

35:25.623 --> 35:27.625
Min-Min!

35:29.127 --> 35:30.753
Min!

35:53.609 --> 35:55.987
- Sir.
- Fall back.

35:56.070 --> 35:58.364
- Meet me at the safe house.
- <i>We're not yet done here-</i>-

35:58.447 --> 35:59.490
Now!

36:02.285 --> 36:03.578
Drive faster.

36:51.000 --> 36:54.420
- <i>I'm done with the killing.</i>
- We have one mission left.

36:54.503 --> 36:55.671
After that, I promise you.

36:56.547 --> 36:57.547
I'll talk to him.

37:01.135 --> 37:02.220
You know I love you.

37:08.768 --> 37:10.144
Thank you.

37:18.903 --> 37:22.114
<i>No matter where you go,
I'll find you, Lily. You hear me?</i>

37:22.198 --> 37:23.324
<i>You can't hide!</i>

37:23.407 --> 37:25.034
Now you know how it feels.

37:25.660 --> 37:27.370
Min-Min!

38:38.816 --> 38:39.817
What?

38:41.277 --> 38:42.737
I'm retired.

38:45.323 --> 38:47.742
There are others out there...

38:48.951 --> 38:51.662
who can do whatever job you may have.

38:58.294 --> 39:00.296
Oh, motherfucker.

39:02.256 --> 39:03.257
Sir Greg...

39:04.633 --> 39:06.635
I need a place to stay.

39:06.719 --> 39:07.720
Lily.

39:08.387 --> 39:10.681
Lily, there's lots of cheap hotels
in the city.

39:10.765 --> 39:13.059
For only 180 pesos,
you have a room with AC,

39:13.142 --> 39:14.977
- free breakfast...
- Sir Greg.

39:15.061 --> 39:18.981
Whatever it is, I don't want to know,
and I want nothing to do with it.

39:20.191 --> 39:21.192
The end.

39:30.368 --> 39:31.786
Please, as a last favor.

39:31.869 --> 39:33.913
What a pain in the ass.

39:36.290 --> 39:40.169
Can't I have some peace and quiet
before I crawl into my fuckin' grave?

39:41.379 --> 39:42.380
Last favor?

39:43.172 --> 39:45.716
I thought the last favor
was the last favor...

39:46.884 --> 39:47.885
and that was that.

39:50.262 --> 39:51.263
Look...

39:52.390 --> 39:54.225
I love you with all my heart...

39:56.977 --> 39:58.062
but my old ticker...

39:59.814 --> 40:02.358
isn't like it was before.

40:03.984 --> 40:07.655
Sometimes I just want to leave
this goddamn country,

40:07.738 --> 40:08.864
away from that family...

40:10.324 --> 40:11.409
that syndicate...

40:12.326 --> 40:14.412
and everyone else
who's involved with it.

40:23.504 --> 40:24.755
You were part of it.

40:28.426 --> 40:30.511
Today I am here
reporting on the aftermath

40:30.594 --> 40:33.222
on what can only be called a massacre.

40:33.305 --> 40:36.475
A father and daughter dead
along with an unknown number of men

40:36.559 --> 40:39.895
is all we could get from the police
and investigators on the scene.

40:59.665 --> 41:01.250
What's the situation?

41:01.333 --> 41:03.752
Boss, reporters are at the scene.

41:04.920 --> 41:08.757
And some of the dead men here
can be identified as your men.

41:09.425 --> 41:10.426
Fix it.

41:11.552 --> 41:14.013
Make sure this doesn't come back to us.

41:14.096 --> 41:15.598
<i>Multiple armed dead men...</i>

41:17.224 --> 41:18.851
plus a dead little girl.

41:19.852 --> 41:22.646
<i>Didn't you hear what I said?</i>

41:22.730 --> 41:28.694
Fix it or else.

41:30.362 --> 41:32.573
Yes, boss. I'll take care of it.

41:43.918 --> 41:45.294
Ahh.

42:03.479 --> 42:04.855
Aren't you...

42:05.940 --> 42:07.024
supposed to be dead?

42:11.278 --> 42:12.696
That was Lily.

42:16.951 --> 42:18.077
That's what I said.

42:19.286 --> 42:20.287
So what now?

42:22.706 --> 42:24.208
Are you supposed to be a zombie?

42:28.087 --> 42:29.088
It's Kaleb.

42:33.509 --> 42:34.510
Kaleb?

42:35.719 --> 42:36.720
A zombie?

42:39.348 --> 42:41.892
What's he have to do with anything?

42:45.646 --> 42:47.022
I'm going to kill him.

42:49.358 --> 42:50.359
Kill him?

42:52.361 --> 42:53.362
Why?

42:56.907 --> 42:57.908
Is it for revenge?

43:02.496 --> 43:03.497
Listen...

43:05.833 --> 43:09.253
nothing good will come from revenge.

43:09.336 --> 43:10.337
Nothing.

43:15.926 --> 43:19.138
If I were you, I'd pick a small town.

43:20.889 --> 43:21.890
You're still young.

43:22.683 --> 43:25.311
Look for a good man...

43:26.729 --> 43:27.771
raise a family...

43:28.814 --> 43:30.524
and live happily ever after.

43:34.486 --> 43:35.779
That's what I did.

43:35.863 --> 43:36.864
So...

43:39.074 --> 43:41.201
What the hell are you doing here, then?

43:41.285 --> 43:42.703
Go back to them.

43:42.786 --> 43:44.622
There, you've got...

43:44.705 --> 43:46.040
Kaleb murdered them.

43:51.211 --> 43:52.254
Ah...

43:54.923 --> 43:56.425
I see. Okay.

43:58.927 --> 43:59.928
Okay.

44:00.721 --> 44:02.097
You can stay here for now.

44:06.685 --> 44:07.686
Sir Greg.

44:10.439 --> 44:11.440
What is it?

44:15.069 --> 44:16.111
Lily is dead.

44:18.572 --> 44:19.573
My name is Maria.

44:21.867 --> 44:24.662
Lily.

44:24.745 --> 44:29.083
Maria. You can be
the immaculate virgin herself...

44:30.668 --> 44:32.294
for all I fucking care.

44:33.295 --> 44:34.296
Is this a trend?

44:37.132 --> 44:38.133
Fine.

44:38.717 --> 44:40.094
I'll be Jesus then.

45:22.594 --> 45:24.263
I am cancelling my trip.

45:27.933 --> 45:28.934
Why?

45:29.810 --> 45:30.853
Guys, get out.

45:32.688 --> 45:33.689
What now?

45:34.898 --> 45:36.400
Would you believe...

45:37.317 --> 45:40.195
that that bullshit Lily is still alive.

45:44.616 --> 45:46.034
Kaleb.

45:46.118 --> 45:47.411
Kaleb, Kaleb.

45:49.121 --> 45:51.498
And to think, this whole time...

45:53.041 --> 45:54.793
we thought he handled that problem.

45:55.669 --> 45:57.755
First, the governor.

45:59.214 --> 46:02.050
Then the fuckin' traitors, and now...

46:02.885 --> 46:03.886
this.

46:07.765 --> 46:08.766
Listen to me.

46:10.142 --> 46:11.143
Take the trip.

46:18.233 --> 46:19.234
I'll handle this.

46:21.195 --> 46:22.196
Like I always do.

46:44.802 --> 46:45.969
What do you need?

46:49.473 --> 46:50.516
Finish her.

46:54.144 --> 46:55.479
Who's she?

46:55.562 --> 46:59.107
An old associate from Black Rose,
like you.

47:01.401 --> 47:02.402
Maybe better.

47:05.364 --> 47:06.365
Location?

47:07.574 --> 47:08.617
Old man Greg.

47:10.160 --> 47:13.038
But our family has an agreement
with him. We can't touch him.

47:14.706 --> 47:17.835
Do not let me down.
Make sure he understands.

47:49.157 --> 47:51.785
Well, lucky me.

47:51.869 --> 47:54.872
Two gorgeous women
with bangin' bodies in one day.

47:59.710 --> 48:02.754
You must be Kaleb's new girlfriend?

48:05.173 --> 48:07.426
You do know the agreement I have
with his family.

48:08.719 --> 48:09.887
I do.

48:16.560 --> 48:17.603
Really?

48:19.021 --> 48:22.482
Is this handsome face of mine...

48:23.275 --> 48:26.403
the last thing you really want to see
before you die?

48:28.447 --> 48:29.573
Bogart.

48:33.035 --> 48:34.536

Well, thank you.

49:35.263 --> 49:37.057
You're good.

49:37.140 --> 49:40.018
You beat a man
twice your size to a pulp. Amazing.

49:54.199 --> 49:55.534
Take him to the hospital!

53:23.783 --> 53:25.452
Love.

53:25.535 --> 53:28.330

you brought with you?

Sorry, sir.

53:34.711 --> 53:36.463
Do you have a cigarette?

Apologize to Bogart.

53:54.105 --> 53:55.106
I'm a woman.

53:59.069 --> 54:00.570
But seriously, Lily...

54:01.488 --> 54:03.323
I trained you to be better than this.

54:07.285 --> 54:08.328
Maria, sir.

54:09.663 --> 54:12.874
Okay. Well, fine, Maria.

54:15.752 --> 54:17.712
I still remember you as Lily.

54:22.133 --> 54:23.593
Lily's dead.

54:37.899 --> 54:39.442
<i>Bert, we need to go.</i>

54:39.526 --> 54:41.736
<i>- Mommy.
- I'm sorry, baby.</i>

55:05.677 --> 55:08.471
<i>Mommy! Mommy!</i>

55:08.555 --> 55:10.181

55:10.265 --> 55:12.058

- Don't do it! Don't!</i>

55:12.142 --> 55:14.227

55:21.318 --> 55:23.778

55:51.014 --> 55:52.098
You told me...

55:53.641 --> 55:55.727
that nothing good
will come from revenge.

55:59.272 --> 56:02.233
But do you think that anything good
can still happen to me, anyway?

56:05.487 --> 56:06.488
You know...

56:08.531 --> 56:10.075
I treated you as my own daughter.

56:13.244 --> 56:16.164
But I still molded you into a killer.

56:20.668 --> 56:22.921
We both know death...

56:24.547 --> 56:25.965
all too well.

56:27.092 --> 56:29.761
We should be numb to it. And...

56:30.470 --> 56:32.222
when they put a hit out on you,

56:32.305 --> 56:33.848
it broke my heart...

56:36.434 --> 56:39.437
to have to be the one to put you down.

56:42.357 --> 56:43.983
Main reason why I retired...

56:46.861 --> 56:48.029
Thank you, Sir Greg.

56:50.907 --> 56:52.492
Pleasure's all mine.

56:53.743 --> 56:55.954
Just give my regards to Jesus...

56:58.748 --> 56:59.749
or the devil.

57:09.676 --> 57:10.677
She's dead.

57:15.223 --> 57:17.225
I turned my back to that life.

57:35.660 --> 57:36.953
The downside...

57:38.997 --> 57:40.540
I couldn't avenge you.

57:47.797 --> 57:50.508
Don't ever think nothing good
will ever come to you again.

57:52.218 --> 57:54.095
Because as long as you're breathing...

57:55.305 --> 57:57.474
you'll always have the chance
to find happiness.

57:58.558 --> 58:00.059
I'm going to need some equipment.

58:19.913 --> 58:21.581
Our factory is in ashes.

58:27.837 --> 58:29.047
I already know, Victor.

58:30.632 --> 58:33.092
We can easily acquire
a new base of operations,

58:33.176 --> 58:34.594
so don't fuckin' lecture me!

58:34.677 --> 58:36.221
Okay, good. I'm taking over.

58:38.598 --> 58:39.974
On whose fuckin' orders?

58:40.058 --> 58:42.185
I can't allow you
to continue to jeopardize...

58:42.268 --> 58:45.021
You can't allow me? Huh?

58:45.104 --> 58:48.358
Who the fuck do you think you are?
I'm gonna say this one last time, Victor.

58:48.441 --> 58:50.235
You stay the fuck out of my way!

58:51.444 --> 58:52.445
There he is.

58:53.279 --> 58:54.280
Right there.

58:57.367 --> 58:59.410
Okay, pull the trigger.

58:59.494 --> 59:01.246
There you go.

59:01.329 --> 59:03.665
That's what I thought. You can't do it.

59:04.624 --> 59:08.002
Let me ask you this question.
You know why Cain killed Abel?

59:10.171 --> 59:12.715
Because Abel was a fuckin' pussy like you.

59:16.469 --> 59:18.680
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you, Victor!

59:19.472 --> 59:22.183
You hear me? One day,
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you!

59:31.192 --> 59:32.360
She was dead once.

59:33.278 --> 59:34.821
Let's make sure she stays that way.

59:35.738 --> 59:38.366
And, Miru, don't fuckin' fail me again.

01:09:10.145 --> 01:09:14.567

01:12:25.758 --> 01:12:27.051

- I give the orders, not you!

01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:53.971

Sir, no one's answering.

01:16:21.618 --> 01:16:25.122
So, do we get in position now?

01:16:29.376 --> 01:16:30.377
Okay.

01:16:31.128 --> 01:16:32.713
Let's see how good you really are.

01:16:42.723 --> 01:16:44.558
What the fuck are they waiting for?

01:17:34.399 --> 01:17:36.443
Hello?

01:17:36.526 --> 01:17:38.320
This is Jesus Christ.

01:17:38.403 --> 01:17:40.614
Greggy boy, I knew that was you.

01:17:40.697 --> 01:17:42.491
<i>This whole time, I thought you retired.</i>

01:17:42.574 --> 01:17:44.409
Well, I am retired.

01:17:44.493 --> 01:17:48.080
Just playing referee
to make sure the game is fair.

01:17:48.664 --> 01:17:50.040
<i>You killed some of my men.</i>

01:17:50.123 --> 01:17:52.876
That's a direct violation of our deal.
You remember the deal.

01:17:52.959 --> 01:17:54.336
I didn't touch you!

01:17:55.087 --> 01:17:56.338
That was the agreement.

01:17:56.421 --> 01:17:59.383
You fuckin' backstabbing old bastard.

01:17:59.466 --> 01:18:01.051
I think Ricardo would be grateful

01:18:01.134 --> 01:18:05.222
that I killed the snakes that he's been
looking for all this time.

01:18:05.305 --> 01:18:07.683
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
What are you trying to say?</i>

01:18:07.766 --> 01:18:09.518
I have ears everywhere...

01:18:10.394 --> 01:18:11.895
and rumors spread...

01:18:12.771 --> 01:18:15.065
- fast.
- <i>Shut the fuck up!</i>

01:18:16.608 --> 01:18:18.068
Fuck you, Greg! Fuck you!

01:20:00.629 --> 01:20:02.464
All these years, I thought you were dead.

01:20:03.507 --> 01:20:04.800
The woman that I loved.

01:20:06.468 --> 01:20:07.803
The woman that I trusted.

01:20:09.596 --> 01:20:11.848
You killed my family.

01:20:14.601 --> 01:20:15.811
You don't deserve them.

01:20:51.805 --> 01:20:52.806
Aah.

01:21:28.592 --> 01:21:29.843
Look around you, Lily.

01:21:31.094 --> 01:21:33.722
Look at how many of my men
you had to kill to get to me.

01:21:40.687 --> 01:21:42.147
It should be obvious by now.

01:21:43.690 --> 01:21:44.774
You can't escape death.

01:21:56.703 --> 01:21:57.996
Aah.

01:21:58.914 --> 01:21:59.915
You are death.

01:22:02.876 --> 01:22:03.877
I know.

01:23:35.719 --> 01:23:37.345
