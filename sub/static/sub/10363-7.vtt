- [Dag in Norwegian] Hello.
- [Torgeir] Hello.

00:58.120 --> 01:00.480
[Johnny in English]
What do you say, pally?

01:00.560 --> 01:03.200
How's that meat transportation
business going, huh?

01:03.280 --> 01:05.120
It is going very good.
Thank you.

01:05.200 --> 01:06.280
Oh, good.

01:08.840 --> 01:11.160
[in Norwegian]
What did I do wrong now?

01:11.240 --> 01:14.800
- Aah! What's going on?
- [in English] Explain one thing to me.

01:14.880 --> 01:20.240
If things are going so well,
why are you fucking with me?

01:20.320 --> 01:22.080
[in Norwegian]
I haven't been fucking with anyone.

01:22.160 --> 01:23.760
[in English] Explain this.

01:27.120 --> 01:29.560
[in Norwegian] You delivered 200 kilograms
of this to the restaurant.

01:29.640 --> 01:33.200
Tenderloin, you said.
Local food and everything.

01:33.280 --> 01:34.720
This shit might not have been shipped,

01:34.800 --> 01:36.960
- but it's been frozen.
- What?

01:37.040 --> 01:39.000
Look at the packaging date, Dag.

01:39.080 --> 01:40.240
Ow!

01:40.320 --> 01:42.000
This shit has been going on for months.

01:42.080 --> 01:47.000
We've received goods for several hundred
thousand less than we've been paid for.

01:47.080 --> 01:50.360
Okay, I realize that.
Stop it. Ow!

01:50.440 --> 01:54.720
I know I should've checked
the delivery better,

01:54.800 --> 01:56.920
but I haven't been myself lately.
Yvonne has left me.

01:59.480 --> 02:00.760
Ow!

02:00.840 --> 02:02.320
[gasping]

02:02.400 --> 02:05.360
[in English]
All right, all right, all right.

02:05.440 --> 02:07.360
I believe him.

02:09.960 --> 02:12.720
Just one more thing.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.240
Where does this farmer live?

02:15.320 --> 02:17.320
[theme music playing]

03:04.520 --> 03:07.600
[in Norwegian]
What are you doing?

03:07.680 --> 03:10.200
[in English] You wanna keep it down?
I'm tweeting.

03:10.280 --> 03:12.280
[scoffs]

03:12.360 --> 03:15.160
[in English] Plug my machine back in
and get the hell out of my property.

03:15.240 --> 03:20.320
[in English]
Ooh! The passion of this guy.

03:20.400 --> 03:24.200
The outrage over stolen electricity.

03:24.280 --> 03:27.680
Any outrage left for scumbag farmers
who rip off

03:27.760 --> 03:31.160
hard-working restaurant guys, like us?

03:31.240 --> 03:32.360
Who are you?

03:32.440 --> 03:36.440
I, my friend,

03:36.520 --> 03:41.600
am the last guy in Lillehammer
you want to fuck with.

03:41.680 --> 03:44.000
Okay? So here's today's agenda:

03:44.080 --> 03:46.440
You're gonna tell us
how much you conned,

03:46.520 --> 03:48.520
and how you're gonna pay it back.

03:48.600 --> 03:50.680
I don't know what you're talking about.

03:51.320 --> 03:52.480
Mm-hm.

03:54.160 --> 03:56.800
- [laughing]
- [in Norwegian] Fucking monkey.

03:58.280 --> 03:59.520
[in English]
This guy is quite a hothead, huh?

03:59.600 --> 04:01.160
Yeah.

04:01.240 --> 04:03.520
I think he needs a little cooling off.
What do you think?

04:05.480 --> 04:06.560
[in Norwegian] No.

04:12.560 --> 04:17.320
Oh, God! Stop, please! Okay, okay!

04:22.840 --> 04:25.520
[sniffs]

04:25.600 --> 04:27.600
[in English] Still stinks.
Hit him again.

04:27.680 --> 04:29.760
[in Norwegian] No, no. Stop.

04:29.840 --> 04:31.280
[whistles]

04:31.360 --> 04:32.920
I have swindled you for a lot of money.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.360
I owe you a lot of money,
but please don't do it.

04:37.440 --> 04:40.600
It's the Internet. All of a sudden,
everything is one click away.

04:40.680 --> 04:41.800
[Torgeir scoffs]

04:41.880 --> 04:47.000
Gucci, Versace... I got hooked.

04:47.080 --> 04:50.360
[in English] A heart-breaking story.

04:50.440 --> 04:53.320
I missed the part about you
paying me back my 300 grand.

04:53.400 --> 04:57.120
[in Norwegian] Three hundred grand?
It can't be that much.

04:57.200 --> 05:01.160
[in English] My colleagues have compiled
your overbillings.

05:05.600 --> 05:07.480
[in Norwegian] Holy shit.

05:07.560 --> 05:12.240
I don't really understand how this guy
is gonna settle his debts.

05:12.320 --> 05:15.040
The accounting is totally  Luksusfellen.

05:15.120 --> 05:17.360
[in English] Got any ideas?

05:17.440 --> 05:19.280
[in Norwegian] Damn Al Gore.
If he hadn't invented the Internet,

05:19.360 --> 05:20.600
we wouldn't be here today.

05:20.680 --> 05:22.120
[in English]
If he hadn't invented global warming,

05:22.200 --> 05:24.600
you'd be skiing in August.
Who gives a fuck?

05:24.680 --> 05:26.680
You better start inventing
something for me,

05:26.760 --> 05:28.720
or that hose is gonna come back out.

05:28.800 --> 05:31.040
[in Norwegian]
This time we'll be cleansing your colon.

05:31.120 --> 05:33.200
[in English]
I have an idea.

05:33.280 --> 05:38.160
[in Norwegian] I inherited a flock
of domesticated reindeer from my uncle.

05:38.240 --> 05:41.000
What if you become partners?

05:41.080 --> 05:43.480
[in English]
You want to pay me in reindeer?

05:43.560 --> 05:45.760
What am I,
freaking Santa Claus now?

05:45.840 --> 05:49.600
[in Norwegian] The point is, the animals
are insured for quite a lot of money.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.680
[in English]
I'm listening.

05:51.760 --> 05:57.040
[in Norwegian] If I get some help,
there could be an avalanche.

05:57.120 --> 06:01.800
And then we are talking
payout in millions.

06:03.160 --> 06:07.160
Is it me, or is this guy
starting to make sense?

06:24.280 --> 06:27.240
[Thomas in Norwegian] Who wants to buy
information about Tagliano?

06:27.320 --> 06:29.920
[Zlatan]
A guy called Aldo Delucci.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.240
[Thomas]
And how do we get hold of him?

06:32.320 --> 06:35.480
[Zlatan] Relax, man. I am tight
with people who are connected.

06:35.560 --> 06:39.080
This is my cousin's cousin.
A guy you have never met before.

06:39.160 --> 06:41.000
- No.
- Doesn't sound like you're close.

06:41.080 --> 06:44.720
Family ties are strong where
I come from. Family comes first.

06:44.800 --> 06:47.120

That's tax-free goods.
Expensive stuff.

Welcome to New York, brother.

[Curtis Lee's
"Pretty Little Angel Eyes" playing]

07:30.120 --> 07:33.160
So, what is going on with your boss?

07:33.240 --> 07:34.360
What do you mean?

07:34.440 --> 07:37.600
People are starting to talk.

07:37.680 --> 07:39.200
About what?

07:41.000 --> 07:42.720
Come on, Tommy.

07:42.800 --> 07:45.560
The word's all over.
People know.

07:45.640 --> 07:50.360
Yeah, well, sometimes people know...
but they don't know.

07:50.440 --> 07:53.640
They always suspected,
but this Filipino houseboy--

07:53.720 --> 07:57.800
All right,  basta.
He's still my boss, and that's it.

07:57.880 --> 08:00.960
- Tommy.
- Shut the fuck up, Staples.

- [bartender] Can I help you?
- We're looking for Aldo Delucci.

08:29.680 --> 08:31.760
Best I can do is a Tom Collins.

08:35.120 --> 08:39.920
Relax,  compadre.  My friend Dino here
is the driver for one of his crew members.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.880
And I believe I have pretty
valuable information for him.

08:45.320 --> 08:49.480
I'm not your  compadre.
Please, get the fuck out.

08:50.680 --> 08:53.080
You sure you don't want to hear me out?

08:53.160 --> 08:56.760
It's about a fellow named Tagliano.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.880
- [bat thuds]
- I'm sure.

08:58.960 --> 09:00.520
[in Norwegian]
Okay. Now he got a bit too harsh.

09:00.600 --> 09:05.520
Fritz and Hans over there
are not especially happy,

09:05.600 --> 09:08.240
so I think we should be leaving.

09:08.320 --> 09:11.000
[in English]
Thank you, goodbye. Thank you.

09:15.920 --> 09:18.960
Hey, Robbie. Two rednecks
dressed up for Halloween

09:19.040 --> 09:21.560

yapping about our old friend.

09:34.880 --> 09:36.000
[spits]

09:39.400 --> 09:42.800
- [Torgeir in Norwegian] Is it more?
- [Dag] We're almost done in there.

09:42.880 --> 09:44.240
[Torgeir] Good.

09:48.320 --> 09:50.480
Nice of you to loan us the car.

09:50.560 --> 09:55.040
It was the least I could do
after that little meat mess.

09:58.360 --> 10:01.120
[Roar]
It's the last one.

10:03.320 --> 10:05.520
Fuck, we need to bring that too.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.080
Double fuck.

10:10.440 --> 10:13.920
You guys will have to take that.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.480
I forgot my gloves.

10:15.560 --> 10:20.000
And these gloves are not suited
for this kind of job.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.840
[grunts]

10:29.920 --> 10:31.720
Yeah, yeah. Shit. Is it full?

10:31.800 --> 10:33.320
[chuckles]

10:33.400 --> 10:36.440
It's full of goodies.

10:36.520 --> 10:39.840
Not even defrosted.
I'll go get some bags.

10:45.520 --> 10:46.840
Oh. Guys?

10:48.840 --> 10:50.760
What the fuck is that?

10:55.640 --> 10:57.720
That ain't no chicken wing.

11:05.360 --> 11:06.840

11:06.920 --> 11:09.160
[in English]
What do you think happened?

11:09.240 --> 11:11.440
[in Norwegian]
I suppose it's unlikely

11:11.520 --> 11:15.600
she went for a late-night snack
and fell in.

11:15.680 --> 11:18.200
[in English]
We'll play detective later.

11:18.280 --> 11:21.960
Right now, we gotta get rid
of that fucking thing.

11:22.040 --> 11:24.200
We'll use your car, okay, Roar?

11:24.280 --> 11:26.920
- [in Norwegian] It's not the best time.
-[in English] What?

11:27.000 --> 11:29.920
[in Norwegian] Torgeir and me are going up
to handle the reindeer thing--

11:30.000 --> 11:31.920
Know what? Put it in my car.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.680
- [in English] Okay. Yeah.
- Mmm.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.840
- All right. Take care of this...
- [Dag] Yeah, sure.

11:36.920 --> 11:39.160
- ...we'll be your new best friends.
- Okay.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.400
[Johnny]
Let's go.

11:41.960 --> 11:43.760
Oddjob.

11:48.880 --> 11:50.720
[grunting softly]

11:55.960 --> 12:00.760
[Dag in Norwegian]
Wait, wait. Give me... five seconds.

12:00.840 --> 12:02.960
[panting]

12:08.920 --> 12:11.120
[Dag]
No. Shit.

12:13.520 --> 12:16.320
I see what you're thinking.

12:18.080 --> 12:20.720
There's that guy who didn't make it,

12:20.800 --> 12:23.320
who had to close his refugee center.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.960
The asshole.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.160
[laughs]

12:29.240 --> 12:31.760
The guy that no one likes.

12:31.840 --> 12:36.560
But if you had seen what I have seen,

12:36.640 --> 12:39.840
experienced what I have experienced.

12:41.400 --> 12:47.360
I've eaten coriander-marinated chicken
with land mine victims from Afghanistan.

12:48.840 --> 12:54.000
I have danced with hijab-clad women
under the northern lights.

12:55.960 --> 13:00.840
I have taught under-nutritioned
Eritrean children to crochet.

13:07.080 --> 13:09.040
I have met Randi.

13:16.560 --> 13:19.600
[sobbing]
My beloved Randi.

13:24.560 --> 13:27.200
My Randi.

13:27.280 --> 13:31.040
Jan? Yes.

13:31.120 --> 13:32.560
- Yes.
- Randi.

13:33.960 --> 13:35.760
Thanks, Jan.

13:37.600 --> 13:41.760
[woman] And thanks to Jan Johansen for...
Well, thanks.

13:41.840 --> 13:43.680
[halfhearted applause]

13:56.200 --> 13:57.760
Hi, Johnny.

13:59.800 --> 14:02.360
[in English]
I saw that performance.

14:02.440 --> 14:04.400
What's going on, Jan?

14:04.480 --> 14:07.920
[in Norwegian] I don't know.
Work has been kind of stressful.

14:10.560 --> 14:13.040
[in English] The job, huh?

14:13.120 --> 14:15.480
You mean the asylum center?

14:15.560 --> 14:19.160
The one you forgot to mention
got closed down?

14:19.240 --> 14:22.560
[in Norwegian]
I didn't want to bother you with it.

14:22.640 --> 14:25.520
But I already have other irons
in the fire. You know me.

14:25.600 --> 14:29.000
Face-first into the ground,
then right back on the horse again.

14:31.600 --> 14:33.840
[in English] Jan, look at me.

14:33.920 --> 14:35.720
We opened the freezer.

14:41.360 --> 14:44.320
[sobbing]

14:47.480 --> 14:49.760
It was an accident.

14:52.640 --> 14:56.080
We were arguing,
and she just tripped.

14:57.280 --> 14:59.360
You have to believe me.

15:01.080 --> 15:02.680
Doesn't matter what I believe.

15:04.080 --> 15:06.360
Questions are gonna be asked.

15:06.440 --> 15:09.960
I can't go to prison.
Please, I can't go.

15:11.880 --> 15:14.520
Relax. The boys took care of the body.

15:15.840 --> 15:17.560
That'll give you time
to get out of the country,

15:17.640 --> 15:19.920
but you've got to go far away.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.720
Some place they're not gonna look.

15:21.800 --> 15:23.880
Far away?

15:23.960 --> 15:25.720
Sounds frightening.

15:27.440 --> 15:29.200
It did wonders for me.

15:31.480 --> 15:33.000
You up for this?

15:34.520 --> 15:36.200
Yeah, sure.

15:44.440 --> 15:46.600
[Torgeir in Norwegian]
What great animals.

15:49.080 --> 15:52.200
Do you think it's right of us
to do this, bro?

15:52.280 --> 15:54.520
Do I think it's right of us

15:54.600 --> 15:57.000
to earn two million
for an hour's worth of work?

15:57.080 --> 15:59.200
Yes, I think that is the right thing.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.400
[Roar] It's not like they feel anything.

16:02.480 --> 16:05.560
What do you know about
what reindeer feel or not?

16:05.640 --> 16:07.760
What I know about it?

16:07.840 --> 16:09.720
It's like pulling up
some pikes from Mjøsa.

16:09.800 --> 16:11.160
It is more or less the same thing.

16:11.240 --> 16:14.200
You don't know what a pike feels either.

16:14.280 --> 16:15.400
Come on.

16:15.480 --> 16:17.920
I have thought a lot about that too.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.960
What the pike thinks when
I pull him out of the water.
