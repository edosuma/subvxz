00:20.020 --> 00:23.524
A SERBIAN FILM

01:01.622 --> 01:04.313
Baby, I'm gonna fuck you up!

01:53.201 --> 01:54.990
Are you insane?

01:55.115 --> 01:57.492
Haven't we agreed about
putting away your flicks?

01:59.870 --> 02:01.997
What's that?
Give it to mommy.

02:02.789 --> 02:04.791
Sorry, but it's not a big deal.

02:05.500 --> 02:08.812
I saw my first porn
when I was his age.

02:08.841 --> 02:10.000
How are you, kiddo?

02:11.009 --> 02:12.803
But your dad wasn't
starring in it!

02:14.430 --> 02:17.141
Marija, I'm sorry
I didn't mean it.

02:17.350 --> 02:20.311
I dug up that DVD because...

02:20.519 --> 02:23.647
Lejla called and
wanted to see me today.

02:24.315 --> 02:26.984
Baby, you want mommy
to make you a toast?

02:27.526 --> 02:29.779
The jumping bread!

02:35.034 --> 02:37.749
Mom, what was dad doing there?

02:37.799 --> 02:40.915
Nothing, hon.
Just playing with a girl friend.

02:41.123 --> 02:44.126
It's like a cartoon
for the grownups.

03:20.296 --> 03:22.173
Honey, I have to pay
for Petar's singing lessons.

03:55.122 --> 03:57.349
- Bye, dad.
- Bye, dad.

04:06.625 --> 04:11.498
Easy on that whiskey.
Rye kills sexual appetite.

04:12.173 --> 04:13.382
That's why I drink it.

04:20.973 --> 04:24.518
- So, how's family life?
- Nice.

04:24.935 --> 04:27.897
How are Petar and... Marija?

04:28.195 --> 04:30.678
Yes, Marija.
They're fine.

04:30.728 --> 04:34.188
Petar's starting school next year.

04:34.695 --> 04:37.490
It'll be interesting
when they ask about

04:37.740 --> 04:39.241
his father's occupation.

04:40.334 --> 04:43.754
His father is a fine gentleman
in a premature retirement.

04:45.664 --> 04:49.168
The problem with that pension
is that it's not lifelong.

04:49.919 --> 04:51.781
How much money do you
have stashed away?

04:52.031 --> 04:55.160
5 or 10 grand?

04:56.264 --> 04:59.438
Miloš, you were more
than just a porn star.

04:59.488 --> 05:01.316
You were an artist.

05:01.366 --> 05:04.433
All actresses you worked with
wanted to marry you.

05:05.504 --> 05:09.707
You're still an artist,
but with a temporary block.

05:10.537 --> 05:11.871
And...

05:14.095 --> 05:16.104
I'm your guardian angel.

05:17.843 --> 05:20.795
Listen. Something big is about to happen.

05:20.871 --> 05:24.311
Artistic pornography of the highest level.
Here, in Serbia.

05:24.662 --> 05:25.878
In Serbia?

05:25.978 --> 05:28.649
Only filmed here,
but for the foreign market.

05:28.999 --> 05:31.965
Terribly professional.
Phenomenally paid.

05:32.315 --> 05:39.439
If you accept, your family will be
settled till the end of Petar's life.

05:42.555 --> 05:46.100
The man's name is Vukmir.
He'll call you in a few days.

05:46.565 --> 05:48.204
Be nice to him.

05:49.785 --> 05:53.014
Here's something for the junior.

05:58.237 --> 06:01.741
Wow, where's his pussy?

06:01.991 --> 06:05.217
You didn't tell me you brought
your policeman brother here.

06:05.267 --> 06:06.186
I came on my own.

06:06.236 --> 06:11.813
I knew you'd be here and couldn't
miss a chance to see you.

06:11.963 --> 06:14.987
I'm your great admirer.

06:26.682 --> 06:28.559
You're well preserved.

06:29.522 --> 06:32.229
Who's the plastic surgeon
we have to thank to?

06:32.563 --> 06:36.942
You know I started early.
I don't need plastic yet.

06:38.235 --> 06:40.196
Everybody needs it.

06:44.533 --> 06:46.369
These don't.

06:51.366 --> 06:55.169
So long, fags.
Miloš, you heard my advice.

06:59.173 --> 07:02.677
- A hooker!
- A porn star.

07:02.927 --> 07:04.387
Has-been.

07:05.888 --> 07:09.266
You know the kind of work
she did after you married?

07:09.934 --> 07:11.084
I know.

07:14.522 --> 07:17.441
No one could handle
a dick like she could.

07:17.692 --> 07:19.360
A natural talent.

07:19.660 --> 07:24.681
Funny she hasn't contacted her
dealer in the past few years.

07:26.075 --> 07:27.326
Is she off drugs?

07:28.184 --> 07:29.775
Doubtful.

07:29.830 --> 07:35.151
A new, rich provider, more likely.

07:35.292 --> 07:39.255
You'll alienate me from my friends
if you keep checking on them.

07:39.494 --> 07:42.836
Friends, in Serbia?

07:42.950 --> 07:45.544
You can't check them enough.

07:48.681 --> 07:50.349
I gotta go.

07:51.142 --> 07:54.228
Say hello to your kid
and his beautiful mom.

07:56.147 --> 07:59.233
I'm paying for the bite.

08:01.610 --> 08:03.779
- So long.
- Bye.

08:32.015 --> 08:34.477
Sleeping time, hands up.

08:35.311 --> 08:37.270
- Dad?
- Yes?

08:37.395 --> 08:39.607
Know that friend of yours

08:39.815 --> 08:42.193
that you were
beating in the video?

08:43.277 --> 08:47.281
It's only a movie. Make believe.
When dad was young.

08:47.531 --> 08:50.409
I know, but while
I was watching it

08:50.618 --> 08:53.746
- I felt something strange.
- What?

08:54.246 --> 08:57.166
Like some kind
of a wheel, spinning.

08:57.625 --> 09:01.754
- A wheel? Where?
- Down there, near my willie.

09:02.213 --> 09:05.716
Several of them,
like a family, traveling.

09:10.513 --> 09:12.348
Do they live in me?

09:12.723 --> 09:15.643
They do, hon, in all of us.
We all have them.

09:16.310 --> 09:20.570
- Everyone in the world?
- Yes, everyone.

09:20.730 --> 09:24.902
They're gone now,
so close your eyes

09:25.111 --> 09:28.577
think of them and
you'll fall asleep faster.

09:40.551 --> 09:42.361
What language is that?

09:43.004 --> 09:44.714
I'm translating for some Swedes.

09:45.464 --> 09:47.383
Swedish? I'm great in it.

09:51.679 --> 09:52.829
That's right.

09:54.223 --> 09:56.225
Wait, I know more.
Listen to this.

10:05.943 --> 10:08.612
You would be a mega star.

10:20.583 --> 10:24.378
So, you say Lejla is
offering you a serious job?

10:25.046 --> 10:28.007
So she said.
It's strange.

10:28.319 --> 10:32.261
Why would anyone
offer me big money

10:32.553 --> 10:36.900
after such a long pause?
In Serbia?

10:41.654 --> 10:44.507
And after all the crap
I shot, look at this.

10:57.536 --> 11:01.432
Maybe they need the only porn
star with a university diploma.

11:10.591 --> 11:12.259
Do you miss it?

11:13.552 --> 11:16.430
- What?
- The job.

11:19.225 --> 11:21.268
I don't know. No.

11:22.645 --> 11:25.898
I miss the money, so we could
escape away from here.

11:35.825 --> 11:39.370
All those poor girls
you threw away like condoms...

11:42.350 --> 11:45.668
How come you've never
done me like them?

11:48.930 --> 11:52.517
Well, I love you.
I've just fucked them.

12:02.935 --> 12:06.952
Does it mean that you
never wanted to fuck me?

14:00.720 --> 14:04.390
<i>Am I talking to the
Balkan sex god.</i>

14:04.682 --> 14:07.518
<i>The Nikola Tesla
of the pornography world ?</i>

14:08.602 --> 14:10.021
You must be Vukmir?

14:10.146 --> 14:12.773
<i>Of course. Miloš, if you're
ready to change your life</i>

14:13.024 --> 14:16.402
<i>right now and provide
for your family for good</i>

14:16.652 --> 14:20.197
<i>a car will be waiting
at your door in 30 minutes.</i>

14:21.590 --> 14:24.869
<i>You just hop in, and take
a ride towards fulfillment</i>

14:25.119 --> 14:28.914
<i>of your personal and
my professional fantasies.</i>

14:29.206 --> 14:30.958
<i>Can't wait to meet you!</i>

14:52.688 --> 14:56.609
I'm honored to shake the hands
of such a great artist, I'm Vukmir.

14:57.735 --> 14:59.195
I'm Miloš, nice to meet you.

15:00.078 --> 15:01.616
The right hand...

15:03.245 --> 15:05.459
is the sex center of any man.

15:07.370 --> 15:10.915
It's direct line between
your brain and cock.

15:12.750 --> 15:14.669
Ever since your childhood.

15:15.587 --> 15:17.621
Your hand is special

15:18.738 --> 15:21.592
for it has jerked
such a special cock.

15:22.006 --> 15:23.203
Miloš.

15:24.357 --> 15:27.846
It's an honor to shake the hand

15:28.146 --> 15:29.891
of such an artist of fuck.

15:34.767 --> 15:38.609
Pornography is art,
but people can't see that!

15:39.402 --> 15:40.552
Why not?

15:40.783 --> 15:43.852
Bebecause they just want
to jizz into a napkin

15:45.032 --> 15:46.784
what they can't into a woman.

15:47.827 --> 15:50.371
These movies are
mostly made so that

15:50.621 --> 15:52.957
those who can't
get laid can cum.

15:55.960 --> 15:58.796
They're made by butchers

15:59.005 --> 16:02.049
who can't tell a camera
from a broom.

16:04.468 --> 16:07.221
Their 'actors' would be
fucking a hole

16:07.388 --> 16:09.807
in the wall if there
were no pussy.

16:10.277 --> 16:16.063
Do you know what proves that
there is art in pornography?

16:16.772 --> 16:17.922
What?

16:18.926 --> 16:20.356
You.

16:21.404 --> 16:22.793
You, Miloš.

16:26.157 --> 16:27.992
You are the proof!

16:28.159 --> 16:32.288
Your sense of handling
a woman, your rhythm

16:32.538 --> 16:36.208
of exhausting her,
your talent to humiliate her,

16:36.459 --> 16:39.962
and then, when she is reduced
to a dog-shit, to win her back.

16:41.005 --> 16:43.507
And your love for it,
that's art.

16:45.530 --> 16:48.023
Sadly, this is no country

16:49.241 --> 16:52.982
for real art.

16:55.269 --> 16:57.813
Where there is no life,
there can't be real art.

16:58.064 --> 17:00.900
A real talent will rot here,
while maggots

17:01.108 --> 17:03.194
are giving press conferences.

17:03.986 --> 17:07.114
Have you done anything
I could've seen?

17:12.161 --> 17:14.704
I'm doing stuff
that no one else is.

17:14.954 --> 17:16.957
Just for the selected clients.

17:17.124 --> 17:19.167
All right, but what is it?

17:20.461 --> 17:23.964
Art, naked art!

17:26.634 --> 17:27.784
Truth.

17:29.512 --> 17:32.640
Real people, real situations,
real sex...

17:36.060 --> 17:37.937
minimal editing.

17:39.647 --> 17:41.607
There's a serious script.

17:43.409 --> 17:45.861
We know it, you don't!

17:54.078 --> 17:56.831
And what am I supposed to do?

17:57.164 --> 18:01.669
The same as always, Miloš.
Just stand before the cameras,

18:01.928 --> 18:06.596
whip out your cock,
and fuck until it's raw.

18:08.217 --> 18:11.721
I dunno, I'm a little tired
of cameras and fucking.

18:12.513 --> 18:15.391
You're also tired of
humping scum

18:15.683 --> 18:18.602
any time your family
needs money.

18:21.647 --> 18:24.358
Kissing some wretched cunts

18:24.434 --> 18:27.603
with the same lips
you'd kiss your kid.

18:39.707 --> 18:41.000
Thanks, doctor.

18:48.090 --> 18:51.093
- What's that?
- The contract.

18:53.179 --> 18:56.682
No need to read all,
just the numbers.

19:17.953 --> 19:19.205
Something wrong?

19:23.376 --> 19:26.712
I don't know what I'm
signing, what I'm shooting.

19:27.838 --> 19:29.799
You're not supposed to know.

19:30.341 --> 19:33.260
If you knew,
you wouldn't be so good.

20:26.113 --> 20:32.601
<i>In a winter night
way up the hill.</i>

20:33.261 --> 20:39.050
<i>A creek was frozen
and covered by the snow.</i>

20:39.682 --> 20:46.472
<i>A bunny's weeping
for that frozen creek</i>

20:46.761 --> 20:52.373
<i>young bunny's crying
with all his heart.</i>

20:52.625 --> 20:58.683
<i>But poor li'l bunny
there upon the hill</i>

20:59.083 --> 21:05.874
<i>perhaps hes after the swallows
heading for a warmer South.</i>

21:08.647 --> 21:10.357
Vukmir.

21:11.427 --> 21:14.274
Sounds like a name of one of those
guys at the Hague tribunal.

21:14.779 --> 21:16.781
Are you sure he's not
an arms dealer?

21:17.885 --> 21:23.162
No, he's some kind of an artist
philosopher with a grand plan.

21:23.743 --> 21:25.539
Is it?

21:26.284 --> 21:27.804
I don't know.

21:29.761 --> 21:34.698
But it seems like he desperately needs me
since he's willing to offer so much money.

21:38.302 --> 21:40.471
How much?

21:41.526 --> 21:44.265
I won't tell you.

21:48.479 --> 21:50.606
Yes you will,
or I'm not giving it back.

21:50.773 --> 21:52.650
Ok, I'll tell you, just let go.

22:07.206 --> 22:08.708
Don't tell me you refused?

22:09.375 --> 22:10.835
Of course I did.

22:11.877 --> 22:15.589
I wanted to see if you're
with me for the money.

22:17.049 --> 22:21.262
If I were, I'd have dumped you
for your brother long ago.

22:27.109 --> 22:30.655
So, you prefer poor
porn stars to bad cops.

22:39.739 --> 22:43.284
Does it means that I should
rent my dick to Vukmir?

22:45.536 --> 22:50.124
Remember what you told me when
I asked if you missed your job?

22:51.121 --> 22:56.465
Miloš, I want both of your
heads to be clear and hard.

22:56.605 --> 22:57.940
If it's true...

23:00.051 --> 23:01.201
If what is true?

23:02.136 --> 23:05.130
That you were always
able to have it erected

23:05.639 --> 23:08.005
without touching or looking.

23:08.155 --> 23:13.772
Like a cock at dawn,
rising to its own song.

23:15.775 --> 23:21.298
I also know that you filmed
all your scenes in the first take.

23:22.505 --> 23:23.723
Don't be so modest.

23:24.953 --> 23:28.342
you're the best,
that's why you're here.

25:13.309 --> 25:15.728
How long do you
think it would take?

25:17.063 --> 25:18.572
A few days.

25:19.837 --> 25:22.201
I haven't translated
from Russian since 1994.

25:31.911 --> 25:35.414
What is it exactly?
Some take-over contract?

25:36.874 --> 25:42.412
We're sending some goods
to Moscow for redistribution.

25:55.017 --> 25:57.520
- Want one?
- Yes.

26:04.026 --> 26:05.528
No thanks.

26:06.070 --> 26:07.738
You said you would.

26:08.030 --> 26:10.408
Oh, sorry.
I'm a bit...

26:13.577 --> 26:15.538
I miss female company.

26:17.331 --> 26:19.834
A least you can always
arrest a fine looking lady.

26:20.710 --> 26:24.455
Yes, but I doubt I'll
ever have the real thing.

26:25.888 --> 26:30.219
A relationship, marriage.
Like two of you.

26:33.180 --> 26:35.725
You stopped hoping too soon.

26:35.975 --> 26:37.893
Women here like men in uniform.

26:38.671 --> 26:40.396
Especially if they're not wearing it.

26:45.294 --> 26:48.612
Sorry, gotta go to the bathroom.

28:26.085 --> 28:28.838
You know what
they say about rye.

28:31.298 --> 28:34.802
It's high time you started
taking care of yourself.

28:35.024 --> 28:38.472
With great talent comes a great
desire for self-fuckability.

28:38.639 --> 28:41.475
- When exactly, do we start?
- In three days.

28:41.892 --> 28:44.228
I'm not comfortable with
not knowing a thing.

28:44.395 --> 28:47.773
Miloš, get a grip.
You're a porn actor

28:49.275 --> 28:52.236
who wants to know
what a porno film is about?

28:53.821 --> 28:55.489
It's a bit absurd.

28:56.282 --> 28:58.951
You're not supposed
to know, but only to relax.

29:01.620 --> 29:05.166
That's too much money
to leave anything to accident.

29:05.458 --> 29:07.251
Nothing is left to accident.

29:07.960 --> 29:09.194
Miloš.

29:10.616 --> 29:12.895
This is a serious organization.

29:14.923 --> 29:17.134
My clients know
exactly what they want,

29:17.184 --> 29:18.894
and I know what I'm doing.

29:20.146 --> 29:23.399
Don't worry, everything
is already prepared,

29:23.649 --> 29:26.068
you just have to appear,
be what you are,

29:27.069 --> 29:30.573
relax and react as Miloš would.

29:34.028 --> 29:36.245
Pornography should not
be an illusion,

29:36.662 --> 29:38.873
but a live transmission of sex.

29:40.040 --> 29:42.367
<i>- Dad.
- Yes, son.</i>

29:42.376 --> 29:44.712
Remember the little wheels?

29:46.046 --> 29:47.339
I do.

29:47.798 --> 29:50.426
Do you know how
to make them spin?

29:51.221 --> 29:52.711
I do.

29:53.618 --> 29:55.664
But you must do it yourself.

29:55.848 --> 29:57.099
We all do it alone.

29:57.833 --> 29:59.585
Tell me how.

30:00.853 --> 30:07.267
When you feel them,
try to follow them.

30:07.969 --> 30:10.613
It's a family traveling

30:12.156 --> 30:16.494
and you just close
your eyes and follow them.

30:22.500 --> 30:25.795
Wait, the wheels are
spinning better at night.

31:12.391 --> 31:14.143
Put it in your ear.

31:38.247 --> 31:41.495
<i>Enter the building, relaxed.</i>

31:56.904 --> 31:59.731
"Home for Abandoned
and Orphaned Children"

32:23.162 --> 32:24.872
<i>Walk slowly ahead.</i>

32:29.522 --> 32:30.886
<i>Be natural.</i>

33:37.194 --> 33:39.405
I wish I impaled
myself on a fence rather

33:39.655 --> 33:41.448
than giving birth to you!

33:41.657 --> 33:45.161
Haven't I told you not to let
the villains take you away?

33:45.843 --> 33:48.122
Get lost, you
misbegotten wretch!

33:49.039 --> 33:50.708
What are you staring at?

34:01.168 --> 34:02.336
<i>Bravo.</i>

34:11.338 --> 34:12.545
What was it like?

34:15.699 --> 34:16.849
Fine.

34:18.569 --> 34:21.906
We were filming at a home
for orphaned children.

34:24.760 --> 34:25.766
Where?

34:25.938 --> 34:27.077
Drag yourself over here!

34:27.203 --> 34:29.027
Look at yourself.

34:29.128 --> 34:32.829
You can't raise a dick,
how will you raise a child?

34:32.875 --> 34:35.503
The child is mine.
Raiko only made it.

34:35.710 --> 34:39.237
I gave birth to it.
Come, you bitch!

34:40.800 --> 34:42.569
Let me go, villains!

34:42.701 --> 34:47.022
Give me back my child,
you bastards!

38:19.924 --> 38:21.570
<i>- Honey?</i>
- Hi.

38:21.918 --> 38:23.135
<i>What are you doing?</i>

38:23.135 --> 38:25.149
I picked up Petar from classes.

38:25.483 --> 38:28.979
I'm taking him to a costume party.
Are you coming?

38:29.153 --> 38:32.283
No, I'm tired.
I must get some sleep.

38:32.406 --> 38:33.556
<i>Everything all right?</i>

38:33.908 --> 38:35.681
Sure. You two enjoy yourselves.

38:35.781 --> 38:39.626
I'll talk to you later,
we must park now. Bye.

38:40.614 --> 38:43.409
<i>The cake is coming.</i>

38:43.709 --> 38:46.504
<i>Never seen such
a cake in my life.</i>

38:47.759 --> 38:53.236
- Aren't you in action?
- <i>Marko, you must do me a favor.</i>

38:54.011 --> 38:55.554
I'm all dick.

38:55.930 --> 38:59.809
<i>I need a detailed background
check on my director,</i>

39:00.254 --> 39:06.387
producer, pimp, goddam
businessman, Vukmir.

39:06.437 --> 39:09.881
I don't know his last name.
Check his whole crew.

39:12.217 --> 39:16.465
Little bro has changed his
views on checking his friends?

39:16.622 --> 39:19.857
Look, it's important and urgent.

39:20.646 --> 39:21.901
<i>Understood.</i>

39:22.562 --> 39:24.043
Everything Ok with you?

39:24.500 --> 39:26.585
Yes, so far.
How about you?

39:27.966 --> 39:29.296
Working on it.

39:39.115 --> 39:41.200
<i>Light the candles.</i>

39:43.935 --> 39:47.898
<i>Happy birthday, dear Petar...</i>

39:59.326 --> 40:03.247
Baby, the time is flying
and your 'animal' is snoozing again.

40:07.001 --> 40:10.504
<i>Come on, blow harder.
Blow harder.</i>

40:12.506 --> 40:16.010
- Blow harder.
- Bravo!

40:19.513 --> 40:22.850
Now we're gonna open
the present from uncle.

40:24.935 --> 40:27.146
This is the present
from your uncle.

40:27.521 --> 40:28.856
How do you open this?

40:35.905 --> 40:41.181
Happy birthday, my sweet son.

41:31.418 --> 41:37.168
What do you think, how does he
manage to be hard for so long?

41:38.968 --> 41:40.879
It's not a dick,
it's a police baton.

41:41.419 --> 41:45.574
If you don't know,
I can't help you.

41:47.550 --> 41:54.320
Those bitches are leaking all over,
and he's servicing all three of them.

41:55.313 --> 41:57.111
How come he's not tired?

41:57.594 --> 42:02.301
Why isn't he fucking limp,
like all the normal people?

42:08.364 --> 42:10.199
You're at it again!

42:11.083 --> 42:14.295
That's hardly gonna
shape it like we all want.

42:16.714 --> 42:18.841
What was so urgent?

42:19.467 --> 42:23.187
You tell me,
what are we shooting?

42:23.429 --> 42:26.067
Are those cameramen real cops?

42:26.117 --> 42:29.209
Are they protection? From what?

42:29.226 --> 42:31.333
Cut the crap!

42:31.334 --> 42:35.213
You're drunk, nearly
impotent and turning dumb.

42:36.583 --> 42:38.961
I may be dumb, but not naive.

42:39.586 --> 42:43.090
Vukmir knows what he's doing.
I trust him more than myself.

42:43.674 --> 42:46.468
They're the greatest pros
you've ever worked with.

42:46.677 --> 42:51.027
What've you done previously
with those pros of yours?

42:51.223 --> 42:56.075
Don't take it all out on me because
I fuck animals for art's sake,

42:56.235 --> 43:00.232
while you can't take a bit
of uncertainty for some big bucks.

43:00.607 --> 43:04.153
Does it mean I'll have to suck
a donkey's dick for money?

43:04.528 --> 43:06.780
It's not so bad, trust me.

43:07.573 --> 43:11.361
Better than the crap
you've been in lately.

43:16.081 --> 43:19.585
- You know I miss that.
- What?

43:20.252 --> 43:22.171
The certainty of that crap.

43:22.337 --> 43:24.590
At least I knew
what I was filming.

43:26.439 --> 43:28.139
Alright,

43:29.060 --> 43:30.845
do you miss this?

43:36.310 --> 43:38.145
You're losing it.

43:39.024 --> 43:41.106
Lucky for you
Vukmir hasn't noticed yet.

44:01.835 --> 44:04.630
You're resting
from healthy life.

44:07.526 --> 44:09.414
How was the costume party?

44:11.595 --> 44:15.140
- What's that?
- It's a balloon.

44:39.667 --> 44:42.418
Your Raiko was a war hero.

44:44.712 --> 44:48.340
If only he knew about
his wife’s whoring!

44:52.553 --> 44:57.307
He would've killed both you
and that poor child of yours.

46:06.251 --> 46:08.170
What the hell
is all this, people?

46:08.504 --> 46:10.964
Hello, I can't work like this!

46:27.648 --> 46:30.734
Hit the whore.
Hit the whore!

46:31.568 --> 46:34.530
Hit her.

47:22.953 --> 47:25.581
Bravo, bravo!
Magnificent!

47:31.753 --> 47:33.247
Miloš?

47:41.688 --> 47:43.641
- Miloš, what's wrong?
- I'm not doing this.

47:43.691 --> 47:46.755
I'm not beating women
in front of kids or cameras.

47:46.810 --> 47:50.356
Miloš, Jeca is our kid.
I'd never dream of hurting her.

47:50.522 --> 47:53.692
Her mother fucked everything,
from stones to barbed wire.

47:53.942 --> 47:56.153
You're like a Sunday
picnic for her.

47:56.320 --> 47:58.197
I'm not only an artist
but also a professional.

47:58.364 --> 48:00.240
I'd never do a thing
against one's will.

48:00.449 --> 48:02.076
You're going against mine.

48:02.284 --> 48:04.620
I won't stand
any kind of torture.

48:05.621 --> 48:07.539
Yeah, you seem to
know a lot about torture.

48:08.540 --> 48:13.115
Did you enjoy it less than that midget woman
who you locked up in an oven in Stuttgart

48:13.141 --> 48:16.408
and pierced a hole in it so
she could suck you off for hours?

48:20.678 --> 48:24.181
At least your dick enjoyed it,

48:28.435 --> 48:30.979
and he never lies.

48:33.148 --> 48:36.652
Vukmir Vukmir.
His name is also his surname.

48:39.071 --> 48:42.574
Worked as a psychologist
in orphanages until 1992.

48:46.829 --> 48:49.373
Then he moved
to the Children's Program

48:49.623 --> 48:52.084
of the State TV.
It's getting better and better!

48:53.131 --> 48:55.759
A lifelong fascination
with the world of film.

48:58.594 --> 49:01.221
Now, it follows with a
mess I had to clarify

49:01.472 --> 49:03.974
with data from
the State Security.

49:04.433 --> 49:08.771
Allegedly, he worked
for them, too.

49:10.856 --> 49:15.519
Sent abroad on a mission,
his trace was lost in Japan.

49:15.719 --> 49:19.073
If he's done any movies,
no one's seen them.

49:23.535 --> 49:25.079
That's about it.

49:26.371 --> 49:28.415
I don't know what bothers you.

49:30.542 --> 49:34.463
According to this you've never
worked with a more educated man.

49:35.138 --> 49:39.120
Who are you gonna trust if not a child
psychologist who is working for the Security?

50:48.221 --> 50:56.215
<i>Hit it, dad, tear it, dad,
uncle Vukmir is shooting.</i>

51:44.877 --> 51:45.946
Want something to eat?

51:46.027 --> 51:49.918
No, I've had my
daily dose of rye.

52:01.680 --> 52:05.183
You don't have to go, you
can do it over the phone.

52:06.184 --> 52:09.729
No, I must show up.
It wouldn't be fair.

53:05.034 --> 53:07.119
Today we're shooting
at home again.

53:07.747 --> 53:11.415
Without me.
As today, I'm retiring.

53:18.048 --> 53:21.551
Is there any way for me
to convince you otherwise?

53:22.302 --> 53:23.452
No.

53:26.556 --> 53:30.177
The kids bother me. I can't do
such stuff in the kindergarten.

53:30.477 --> 53:32.812
I fully understand you.

53:34.981 --> 53:37.692
But, in that case
between you and the kids,

53:37.943 --> 53:41.112
I must choose kids. They're
my specialty, my whole life.

53:42.530 --> 53:46.034
It's my fault. I thought you'd
be better if you didn't know...

53:47.826 --> 53:51.372
If I had known from the start,
I'd only have declined sooner.

53:54.167 --> 53:56.544
What did you say, kindergarten?

53:58.380 --> 54:00.757
That's a good term.

54:03.468 --> 54:06.721
This whole fucking country is
one big shitty kindergarten.

54:08.840 --> 54:12.006
A bunch of kids
discarded by their parents.

54:13.185 --> 54:14.647
Do you know what it feels like?

54:15.807 --> 54:17.523
Your whole life you're
compelled to prove

54:17.774 --> 54:20.610
that you're able
to take care of yourself.

54:21.778 --> 54:24.572
To prove that you
can shit, eat, fuck

54:24.823 --> 54:26.950
drink, bleed, earn money...

54:27.167 --> 54:31.108
do whatever it takes to survive.

54:31.675 --> 54:33.485
Until you die!

54:33.535 --> 54:37.043
Would you believe me
if I told you that me and

54:37.460 --> 54:41.423
this wonderful family, that
you're so anxious to leave

54:41.881 --> 54:46.469
are the only warrant of
this nation's survival?

54:48.513 --> 54:52.434
We are the backbone
of this country's economy.

54:53.476 --> 54:57.188
Only we can prove that
this nation is alive

54:58.440 --> 55:01.109
and useful for anything.

55:04.988 --> 55:08.491
I can see that you're insane,
I need no proof for that.

55:08.788 --> 55:12.369
Just tell me, how does it
all connect to pornography?

55:18.445 --> 55:21.606
No, Miloš, no, no!

55:22.919 --> 55:24.356
Not pornography.

55:24.382 --> 55:28.325
Not pornography,
but life itself!

55:28.762 --> 55:31.014
The life of a victim.

55:31.848 --> 55:34.809
Love, art, blood...

55:36.770 --> 55:39.564
Flesh and soul of a victim.

55:40.190 --> 55:43.818
Transmitted live to the
world who has lost all that

55:45.361 --> 55:47.656
and now is paying to watch that

55:47.906 --> 55:50.992
from the comfort of an armchair.

55:52.118 --> 55:54.621
I have no doubt
that it sells well

55:54.788 --> 55:57.249
based on the sum you offered me.

55:58.416 --> 56:01.127
Victim sells, Miloš.

56:04.464 --> 56:07.968
Victim is the priciest
sell in this world.

56:08.885 --> 56:12.389
The victim feels the most
and suffers the best.

56:13.598 --> 56:15.976
We are victim, Miloš.

56:16.226 --> 56:19.229
You, me, this whole
nation is a victim.

56:19.813 --> 56:22.065
We're just too retarded.

56:22.649 --> 56:25.485
And I won't be
a victim bebebecause of that.

56:27.529 --> 56:28.697
But Miloš...

56:29.030 --> 56:31.783
you're the only one in this
film who is not a victim!

56:34.035 --> 56:35.185
Is that so?

56:40.542 --> 56:42.335
Allow me, as your shepherd

56:42.502 --> 56:44.671
to show you the power
of a real victim.

59:09.724 --> 59:12.911
Can it be that you don't get it?

59:13.903 --> 59:16.315
This is a new genre, Miloš!

59:16.680 --> 59:18.253
A new genre!

59:18.525 --> 59:20.777
Newborn porn!

59:22.120 --> 59:23.788
Newborn!

59:41.784 --> 59:44.457
<i>...so that tomorrow,
on 18th of May...</i>

59:44.507 --> 59:48.250
<i>...you'll witness a new Serbian
jet-set extravagance...</i>

01:02:54.153 --> 01:02:56.322
<i>Mobile user is not
available at the moment...</i>

01:03:06.033 --> 01:03:08.667
<i>Mobile user is not
available at the moment...</i>

01:05:25.719 --> 01:05:27.258
If you only knew how easily

01:05:27.308 --> 01:05:29.456
cattle aphrodisiac
is diluted in whiskey.

01:05:29.486 --> 01:05:32.322
Actually, rye doesn't kill
sexual desire at all, right?

01:05:37.274 --> 01:05:38.484
Viagra for bulls!

01:05:38.651 --> 01:05:42.238
A special recipe concocted
by our sexy doctor who is

01:05:42.313 --> 01:05:44.928
so fond of speed that
she puts it into coffee, too.

01:05:45.209 --> 01:05:46.585
Can he follow my words?

01:05:49.088 --> 01:05:51.842
Now, that's our stud!

01:05:51.892 --> 01:05:53.050
Look at him, look at him!

01:05:53.842 --> 01:05:55.219
Bravo, bravo!

01:06:44.561 --> 01:06:47.188
<i>She's a dirty junky cunt!</i>

01:06:47.397 --> 01:06:49.941
<i>She destroyed her child,
daughter of a war hero!</i>

01:06:50.149 --> 01:06:54.112
<i>Sweet little Jeca watched
her mother fuck the junky bums.</i>

01:06:54.362 --> 01:06:57.907
<i>She is scum.
Hit the whore! Hit the bitch!</i>

01:07:01.828 --> 01:07:03.955
Yeah, you bitch!

01:07:05.039 --> 01:07:07.458
<i>Yes, that's one
of the bitch-mothers</i>

01:07:07.709 --> 01:07:09.878
<i>who conceive babies in lust</i>

01:07:10.044 --> 01:07:11.963
<i>and than throw
them into a river.</i>

01:07:12.130 --> 01:07:13.923
<i>The lustful brood of wenches</i>

01:07:14.173 --> 01:07:16.426
<i>with endless gashes in them.</i>

01:07:26.728 --> 01:07:29.158
<i>Imagine she were
your son's mother.</i>

01:07:29.325 --> 01:07:32.301
<i>Imagine her turning Petar
into a dog-fucker's bitch!</i>

01:07:32.525 --> 01:07:34.235
<i>Imagine that, Miloš!</i>

01:07:36.645 --> 01:07:39.365
<i>Strike her, hit her!</i>

01:07:58.635 --> 01:08:00.637
<i>That's it!
Bravo!</i>

01:08:01.554 --> 01:08:04.515
<i>The unique magic of
rigor mortis!</i>

01:10:43.047 --> 01:10:45.925
<i>That's right, make it right.</i>

01:10:49.303 --> 01:10:51.055
<i>Fucking cell!</i>

01:10:55.309 --> 01:10:57.103
<i>What?</i>

01:10:58.819 --> 01:11:00.862
<i>Never mind, he'll come to me.</i>

01:11:01.477 --> 01:11:03.758
<i>Don't worry, he will.</i>

01:11:04.994 --> 01:11:08.498
<i>Fucking hell.
Ok, run now.</i>

01:11:33.928 --> 01:11:36.014
<i>This one is on me.</i>

01:12:12.383 --> 01:12:14.719
<i>Now you ruined it all.
You've destroyed the project.</i>

01:12:14.886 --> 01:12:16.387
<i>I did what? How?</i>

01:12:16.596 --> 01:12:19.849
<i>You could've drugged any of
your apes to fuck like insane.</i>

01:12:20.141 --> 01:12:25.530
<i>You had Miloš. Now you don't.
Now he's a headless dick.</i>

01:12:25.563 --> 01:12:28.066
<i>If only you sliced, say,
his son's ear</i>

01:12:28.316 --> 01:12:30.860
<i>he'd be his old self again!</i>

01:12:31.569 --> 01:12:34.781
<i>He'd fuck God in the ass
at your command!</i>

01:12:35.114 --> 01:12:39.619
<i>Instead, you take a genius and
fill him with a fuck-dope.</i>

01:12:40.745 --> 01:12:43.498
<i>You're cheap,
just like everyone else.</i>

01:12:43.706 --> 01:12:46.251
<i>Fear is bad.
It's a downer.</i>

01:12:46.417 --> 01:12:50.588
<i>He needs to rise high. To feel
the ecstasy of a free fuck.</i>

01:12:50.964 --> 01:12:53.800
<i>When he feels it,
he'll forget all</i>

01:12:54.050 --> 01:12:56.803
<i>including his wife,
son, mother...</i>

01:12:58.012 --> 01:13:02.635
<i>What do you know
about free fuck?</i>

01:13:02.703 --> 01:13:04.727
<i>What do you know
of ecstasy?</i>

01:13:05.645 --> 01:13:09.977
<i>This is no art.
You're no longer an artist!</i>

01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:12.179
<i>I'm not working for you anymore.</i>

01:13:12.223 --> 01:13:15.399
<i>Nor is Miloš.
I'm taking him home.</i>

01:15:44.104 --> 01:15:45.443
Get away from me!

01:15:56.508 --> 01:16:01.096
<i>God itself brought you, son.
God sent you to deliver us...</i>

01:16:01.675 --> 01:16:06.263
God itself brought you, son.
God sent you to deliver us...

01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:11.136
from that whore,
may she rest in peace,

01:16:12.311 --> 01:16:16.941
She was a shame to our house.

01:16:17.942 --> 01:16:23.447
Raiko was a great warrior,
but had a poor taste in women.

01:16:25.574 --> 01:16:31.038
Since he was killed, this house
rots with no male to govern it.

01:16:32.498 --> 01:16:38.295
That's why God sent you as
our savior from all worry.

01:16:45.627 --> 01:16:49.058
There's not only house,

01:16:49.208 --> 01:16:53.809
but a daughter to take care of, too.

01:16:53.978 --> 01:16:58.774
Our poor Jeca became an orphan.

01:17:00.568 --> 01:17:03.320
My Alice in Wonderland.

01:17:05.744 --> 01:17:08.725
Raiko was killed just
when he was supposed to

01:17:08.784 --> 01:17:12.746
prove to Jeca that
he's not only a father,

01:17:13.038 --> 01:17:16.709
but a man as well.
You came instead of him.

01:17:18.622 --> 01:17:25.068
You'll have the honor of giving
her a virgin's communion.

01:17:25.389 --> 01:17:27.750
To make her a woman.

01:17:28.557 --> 01:17:33.543
Like my late father did with me.

01:17:44.820 --> 01:17:48.240
Come on, come on...

01:17:52.586 --> 01:17:54.254
Now!

01:18:06.054 --> 01:18:08.764
I'm gonna cut it off,
you motherfuckers!

01:18:08.814 --> 01:18:10.417
No, Miloš, no...

01:18:23.103 --> 01:18:24.729
<i>Our film jumped
through the window!</i>

01:18:25.063 --> 01:18:26.689
<i>What are you waiting for?
After him!</i>

01:21:03.138 --> 01:21:06.875
- Marko, it's me. Come for me.
- <i>Miloš, what's wrong?</i>

01:21:06.925 --> 01:21:11.646
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- I'm on Celopecka street, no 7.

01:21:11.647 --> 01:21:12.990
Come and get me.

01:21:13.016 --> 01:21:14.190
<i>Miloš!</i>

01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:52.896
Hey, baby, where
you headin' for?

01:21:53.229 --> 01:21:57.789
Out naked, but
won't take a dick?

01:21:58.902 --> 01:22:01.946
Be polite, the girl is underage.

01:22:03.531 --> 01:22:06.159
So what if I am underage?

01:22:12.624 --> 01:22:14.250
Look at this jerk!

01:22:38.441 --> 01:22:40.819
No, Raša, don't.

01:22:49.171 --> 01:22:52.551
<i>Rare kind of Monks
put seven adult he-goats</i>

01:22:52.601 --> 01:22:54.888
<i>into a shed during summer.</i>

01:22:55.367 --> 01:22:58.252
<i>They leave them for a month</i>

01:22:58.795 --> 01:23:02.579
<i>until their balls
are like melons.</i>

01:23:03.214 --> 01:23:07.218
<i>When they get too hot,
they start fucking one another.</i>

01:23:07.627 --> 01:23:11.406
<i>The monks take the dried
bloody cum off their balls</i>

01:23:11.456 --> 01:23:13.066
<i>and mix it with milk.</i>

01:23:13.425 --> 01:23:19.501
<i>It makes the finest
bread spread there is.</i>

01:23:21.425 --> 01:23:25.976
<i>You're a he-goat, Miloš.
I'm your monk.</i>

01:23:26.977 --> 01:23:29.605
Don't worry, my child.

01:23:35.605 --> 01:23:37.607
My he-goat.

01:23:40.735 --> 01:23:44.959
I'll provide a
fitting end for you.

01:26:57.308 --> 01:27:01.020
Welcome to a warm family home.

01:29:55.512 --> 01:30:00.362
A real, happy Serbian family.

01:30:02.940 --> 01:30:04.316
Life...

01:30:06.168 --> 01:30:07.544
Art.

01:31:37.202 --> 01:31:40.872
That's it, Miloš.
That's cinema.

01:32:57.360 --> 01:32:59.633
That's film!

01:33:13.862 --> 01:33:15.525
Get away from me!

01:36:59.658 --> 01:37:09.920
<i>In a winter night
way up the hill.</i>

01:37:11.617 --> 01:37:17.482
<i>A creek was frozen
and covered by the snow.</i>

01:39:42.607 --> 01:39:44.123
Come on.

01:39:48.682 --> 01:39:50.806
Start with the little one.
