- Good morning.

- What are you looking for?
- A piece of bread or a muffin.

01:19.259 --> 01:22.295
- In your world, a croissant.
- Carbs.

01:22.329 --> 01:23.829
- Yes.
- Empty calories.

01:23.864 --> 01:26.499
- Bingo.
- Well, you're not gonna find anything,

- [Door closes] I never slept better.
- We were wondering.

- Feel my hair ... thick, right?
- Feels hairy.

01:41.682 --> 01:43.249
[Exhales sharply]

01:43.283 --> 01:46.252
- Silky.
- Thank you.

<i>Don't bother. 
There's no food in there.</i>

01:48.422 --> 01:51.424
- Nothing white.
- Is this a goal...

01:51.458 --> 01:54.393
for... humans... that eat food?

01:54.428 --> 01:57.663
There's a scientific basis for it.

01:57.698 --> 02:00.891
No white rice, no white
flour, no white sugar.

02:00.893 --> 02:02.826
Pop-tarts?

02:02.860 --> 02:05.595
Well ... Well, it's brown
when you cook them.

02:05.630 --> 02:09.399
- Is that what I taught you?
- Yes!

02:09.434 --> 02:12.135
You taught me that food
is fuel. Grab it, go.

02:12.170 --> 02:13.770
Well, then, I'm sorry.

02:13.805 --> 02:16.807
There's a healthier way to eat
that makes you feel better.

02:16.841 --> 02:20.537
- And this is it.
- Ma, you look great.

02:20.572 --> 02:22.279
You don't need to go on a diet.

02:22.313 --> 02:26.416
Thank you, baby, but I'm not
doing it to diet or lose weight.

02:26.451 --> 02:28.151
I do it to have more energy.

02:28.186 --> 02:29.753
Yeah, and eating more
colorful fruits and vegetables

02:29.787 --> 02:32.806
increases our intake of
phytochemicals, which is linked

02:32.807 --> 02:35.826
to decreased rates of heart
disease, cancer, and diabetes.

02:39.730 --> 02:42.199
I just expect mine to get
me from breakfast to lunch.

02:42.233 --> 02:44.201
<i>And this diet will do it.</i>

02:44.235 --> 02:47.437
It's gluten-free muesli,
berries, and non-fat yogurt.

02:47.472 --> 02:48.672
What color's your yogurt?

02:49.941 --> 02:52.758

- Okay, so, cupcakes, Red Bull, and a martini.
- You don't have to get all fancy with it.

Oh, Frankie lost a bet, and

But you're probably talking
about the crime scene, though.

04:01.753 --> 04:04.421

I'm gonna go check the lot for his car.

04:04.456 --> 04:07.424
Canadian hockey.

04:07.459 --> 04:11.829
The victim is Mark Harris, 32.

04:11.863 --> 04:16.399
- Took a single arrow to the back.
- Maura: Ooh.

04:16.434 --> 04:20.404
Actually, a bolt.
From a crossbow.

04:20.438 --> 04:23.740
A bolt is smaller than
an arrow, and it's metal.

04:23.775 --> 04:27.044
- This is likely from a pistol grip.
- It's easy to get, easy to hide.

04:27.078 --> 04:29.880
A shooter would need
to be within 35 yards

04:29.914 --> 04:33.817
- for an accurate shot.
- Any other injuries?

04:33.852 --> 04:37.421
Well, it looks like some bruising
from the fall after being shot.

04:37.455 --> 04:39.106
He was competing in a
very important regional

04:39.170 --> 04:41.859
- bass-fishing tournament.
- Really? Very important?

04:41.893 --> 04:44.328
Winner here gets $100,000
and goes to the nationals.

04:44.362 --> 04:46.330
Top prize there is $500,000.

04:46.364 --> 04:49.566
- Very important it is!
- He was in the lead.

04:49.601 --> 04:51.469
With what he had in his tank,
it would have been very difficult

04:51.470 --> 04:53.337
- for anybody to beat him.
- Crossbow's kind of perfect for the environment.

04:53.371 --> 04:54.738
I mean, it's completely quiet.

04:54.772 --> 04:56.640
And not unusual for an
outdoorsman to have one.

04:56.674 --> 04:59.510
He has a sunburn on
one side of his face.

04:59.544 --> 05:01.912
So it's likely he was
dead in the boat for hours.

05:01.946 --> 05:04.638
I'm surprised none of the
other fishermen saw him.

05:04.713 --> 05:06.758
Well, the water's too
shallow for bass here.

05:06.871 --> 05:10.086
- Nobody would have come by.
- Huh.

05:10.121 --> 05:11.855
What is it?

05:11.889 --> 05:15.091
This blood pooling.
Something's not right.

05:15.126 --> 05:16.560
What are you thinking?

05:16.594 --> 05:20.831
- I'm gonna have to investigate further.
- Surprise, surprise.

05:21.699 --> 05:23.533
<i>[Static] 
Frankie: Hey, Jane. You there?</i>

05:23.568 --> 05:24.968

05:25.002 --> 05:26.703
Okay. I'll be right there.

05:31.108 --> 05:35.579
- This is the car Mark Harris drove?
- Yeah.

05:37.048 --> 05:39.883
Doesn't really fit in, does it?

05:39.917 --> 05:42.285
I'm guessing Mark Harris
didn't really fit in either.

05:42.320 --> 05:43.820
According to tournament officials,

05:43.855 --> 05:46.723
he was a college professor
... taught poetry.

05:46.757 --> 05:50.093
Oh, well, that's the perfect training
for becoming a fisherman.

05:50.127 --> 05:52.562
I know. 
It doesn't make any sense.

05:52.597 --> 05:56.299
It also doesn't make sense that
he was leading the tournament.

05:56.334 --> 05:58.902
The emergency contact
on his phone was his wife, Carla.

05:58.936 --> 06:01.338
- I'll give her a call.
- Okay.

06:03.274 --> 06:08.712
- Korsak: Jane?
- Yeah?

06:08.746 --> 06:12.509
This is Skeet Martin.
He was fishing in the competition.

06:12.537 --> 06:15.666
He wants to talk to you. 
Only you.

06:15.667 --> 06:18.795
This is Detective Rizzoli. Excuse me.

06:19.411 --> 06:23.473
Do you know something about
what happened here this morning?

06:23.507 --> 06:25.041
Uh, no.

06:25.075 --> 06:27.977
- Did you know Mark Harris?
- No, ma'am.

06:28.011 --> 06:29.512
So, why did you need to talk to me?

06:29.546 --> 06:33.216
Well, I tried to hire a
skywriter with my cellphone,

06:33.250 --> 06:35.785
but I couldn't seem
to get any reception.

06:35.819 --> 06:39.789
- A skywriter?
- To ask you out to dinner.

06:39.823 --> 06:42.325
- That's it?
- And to watch the sunset?

06:43.159 --> 06:45.995
I don't have time for this.

06:46.029 --> 06:48.397
Hey, we don't have
to talk about fishing.

06:48.432 --> 06:52.034
I ... or we can talk about fishing,
if it'll help your case.

06:53.871 --> 06:58.074
Is it the air? Is it the trees?
There's just group insanity going ...

06:58.108 --> 07:00.276
- What are you doing?
- Fish scales.

07:00.310 --> 07:02.879
Well, can you sniff the tires
and tell me where the car's been?

07:02.913 --> 07:05.181
[Sighs]

07:09.419 --> 07:12.054
[Lid thuds]

07:15.392 --> 07:18.227
It's addressed to Mark. 
Probably Harris.

07:18.262 --> 07:20.096
<i>"Say anything, and
you'll sleep with these."</i>

07:20.130 --> 07:22.031
That's not very original.

07:22.065 --> 07:24.233
Somebody threatened him.
He didn't take it seriously.

07:24.268 --> 07:26.502
Well, he had about
100,000 reasons not to.

07:26.537 --> 07:28.885
Same number of reasons somebody
would ado want him dead.

07:36.057 --> 07:38.469
<i>Mark was a college professor ... </i>

07:38.614 --> 07:41.628
Elizabethan poetry.
He loved it.

07:41.662 --> 07:44.731
When he was denied tenure,
it was an enormous blow.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.900
What happened after he lost his job?

07:46.934 --> 07:48.968
He looked and looked for another.

07:49.003 --> 07:51.738
When he couldn't find
one, he fell apart.

07:53.207 --> 07:56.176
So did our marriage.

07:56.210 --> 07:59.079
We filed for divorce.

07:59.113 --> 08:02.882
How did he get involved with, uh,
competitive fishing?

08:02.917 --> 08:07.287
He went up to Maine to
a friend's cabin by a lake

08:07.321 --> 08:10.623
to clear his head and work on
his long-neglected book of poetry.

08:10.658 --> 08:14.160
But Mark had writer's block.

08:14.195 --> 08:19.632
So, one day, Mark went fishing
to take the pressure off

08:19.667 --> 08:23.303
and found out he was a natural.

08:23.337 --> 08:25.905
The fish just... came to him.

08:25.940 --> 08:29.042
He entered a tournament and won.

08:29.076 --> 08:31.711
And he won tournament after tournament.

08:31.746 --> 08:34.914
When was the last time
you saw your husband?

08:34.948 --> 08:36.649
The first day of the tournament.

08:36.683 --> 08:39.785
Um, I brought him the divorce papers

08:39.820 --> 08:41.921
so he could sign them
and embrace his new life.

08:41.956 --> 08:48.862
- And did he?
- No. He ripped up the papers.

08:48.896 --> 08:53.133
This was to be his last tournament.
He wanted to come back home.

08:53.167 --> 08:56.402
Well, Mrs. Harris,
thank you for coming in.

08:56.437 --> 09:00.174
And, um, we're very sorry for your loss.

09:01.142 --> 09:06.346
- If you think of anything else...
- Uh, Mark did mention one name.

09:06.380 --> 09:09.983
Um, the woman who made his lures ...

09:10.017 --> 09:12.852
Linda Hendrickson ...
she was his confidante.

09:12.887 --> 09:14.387
I'm sorry to ask, but
do you happen to know

09:14.421 --> 09:17.857
- the nature of their relationship?
- Friends.

09:18.926 --> 09:24.030
I think.
We were separated when they met,

09:24.064 --> 09:28.434
so if it was something
else, that's okay.

09:28.469 --> 09:31.771
God, it doesn't matter now.

09:31.806 --> 09:35.441
[Inhales sharply]
None of this matters now.

09:35.476 --> 09:37.377
[Sighs]

09:37.411 --> 09:41.114
[Telephone ringing]

09:41.148 --> 09:46.386
- Hi. Is the autopsy done yet?
- Uh, Kent's finishing up the report.

09:46.420 --> 09:49.989
So, do you want the bad news
or the bad news?

09:50.024 --> 09:53.226
- Mm, you pick.
- The threatening note to Mark Harris

09:53.260 --> 09:55.261
was on standard paper,
with standard ink,

09:55.296 --> 09:57.997
using a standard printer.
There are no fingerprints.

09:58.032 --> 10:02.268
- What's the bad news?
- No prints. No markings.

10:02.303 --> 10:05.004
This is a standard 436-grain bolt

10:05.039 --> 10:07.941
fired from a
350-foot-per-second crossbow.

10:07.975 --> 10:10.143
- Conclusion ...
- We have nothing.

10:10.177 --> 10:13.199
Ding, ding, ding!
[Groans]

10:14.215 --> 10:18.918
- What's with the fish tanks?
- Uh, they were in Mark's live well,

10:18.953 --> 10:20.787
so they're evidence ...
I brought them back here,

10:20.821 --> 10:22.455
but now I don't really
know what to do with them.

10:23.924 --> 10:25.325
This one likes me.

10:25.359 --> 10:27.160
He's probably swimming
toward his reflection.

10:27.194 --> 10:29.295
[Scoffs] 
Can't he just like me?

10:30.231 --> 10:32.832
Fish are actually drawn
to changes in light.

10:32.867 --> 10:34.500
Sports-fishing boats
sometimes use bright lights

10:34.535 --> 10:38.338
- to draw them to the surface.
- You fish, Kent?

10:38.372 --> 10:42.175
Only for food. 
Same way I hunt.

10:42.209 --> 10:45.445
- Did you hunt and skin your belt?
- Of course.

10:45.479 --> 10:48.314
The autopsy report on Mark Harris.

10:51.852 --> 10:55.445
- Oh, he seems lovely.
- Yeah, I am not sure

10:55.480 --> 10:57.457
I understand
what's going on with that guy.

10:57.491 --> 11:00.059
I keep telling you to throw him back in.

11:00.094 --> 11:01.594
Or hunt him.

11:03.230 --> 11:05.932
- Maura?
- Mark was on coumadin.

11:05.966 --> 11:07.867
- Oh, the blood thinner?
- He bled out quickly.

11:07.902 --> 11:11.905
So, any wound would have been fatal
if he didn't get help right away.

11:11.939 --> 11:14.140
It also means the shooter didn't have
to be good. He just had to hit him.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.542
Which means the shot
could have been fired

11:16.577 --> 11:19.212
from as far away as 60 yards.

11:19.246 --> 11:22.991
Which means we have a lot more suspects.

11:24.852 --> 11:25.952
[Beeping]

11:25.986 --> 11:27.820
Nina: There were 60 contestants.

11:27.855 --> 11:30.490
I used each boat's GPS
trackers to narrow the search

11:30.524 --> 11:32.492
to boats within crossbow
range of the victim

11:32.526 --> 11:34.427
at the estimated time
and place of death.

11:34.461 --> 11:36.562
<i>[Beeping] 
Frankie: Better.</i>

11:36.597 --> 11:40.300
The M.E. also sent up forecasts
of the bullet trajectory.

11:40.334 --> 11:43.169
I'm gonna input those and see if
it eliminates a few more boats.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.972
Great.
I'll check back in with you later.

11:46.006 --> 11:48.374
Time to pay off your bet.
Meet your flour baby.

11:48.409 --> 11:50.276
[Sighs]

11:50.311 --> 11:51.878
You have to care of that as
if it's your very own baby.

11:51.912 --> 11:54.380
It's how they teach
responsibility to teenagers.

11:54.415 --> 11:57.016
While you're in the station,
care for that as if it's your very own.

11:57.051 --> 12:00.119
- For how long?
- One day. Be a good dad.

12:00.154 --> 12:02.989
Every time you're not, I add a day.

12:03.023 --> 12:05.558
[Scoffs] 
This is silly, but easy.

12:05.592 --> 12:06.926
- We'll see.
- Oh, I got this.

12:06.961 --> 12:08.428
We'll see.

12:10.164 --> 12:12.365
[Chuckles]

12:16.937 --> 12:19.906
<i>Linda Hendrickson's dad
was a champion fisherman.</i>

12:19.940 --> 12:22.175
She grew up on lakes across 
New England.

12:22.209 --> 12:24.310
Doesn't seem like much
of a love connection

12:24.345 --> 12:27.413
for an ex-professor
of Elizabethan poetry.

12:27.448 --> 12:31.884
- Strange thing, love.
- Oh, do enlighten me.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.186
I would, but we're here.

12:33.220 --> 12:35.922
[Knock on door]

12:35.956 --> 12:37.490
<i>Linda: Come in!</i>

12:43.998 --> 12:45.465
[Coughs] 
Ohh!

12:45.499 --> 12:46.666
[Clears throat]

12:46.700 --> 12:48.935
Hi. Um, I'm Detective Jane Rizzoli.

12:48.969 --> 12:50.570
This is Detective Vince Korsak.

12:50.604 --> 12:52.305
Yeah, hi. Linda. 
Just give me a sec.

12:52.339 --> 12:55.608
<i>I'm... baking. 
Sorry about the smell.</i>

12:55.642 --> 12:57.977
- No, no. It's ... it's, uh ...
- Horrible.

12:58.012 --> 13:00.480
They're very effective, but they stink.

13:00.514 --> 13:04.650
Um... we, uh... we wanted
to talk about Mark Harris.

13:04.685 --> 13:07.120
Oh, yeah.

13:07.154 --> 13:11.190
Yeah. It's so sad.
It's just a tragedy.

13:12.426 --> 13:15.261
Um, wh-what was the status
of your relationship?

13:15.295 --> 13:19.265
Well, at first, I thought
he was just lonely ...

13:19.299 --> 13:24.270
or horny, like they get
after eight hours on the lake.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.139
But, uh, you know, it turns out

13:26.173 --> 13:28.674
he was a sponge for
knowledge about fishing.

13:28.709 --> 13:31.711
- So, he was a customer?
- At first.

13:31.745 --> 13:35.481
Then... well, after eight
hours in this kitchen,

13:35.516 --> 13:39.519
it makes me want some
air and some contact.

13:39.553 --> 13:41.487
[Clears throat] How long
were you two together?

13:41.522 --> 13:45.598
Not long. I broke it off.
Mark wasn't my kind of guy.

13:45.687 --> 13:48.073
Well, I got to say, I'm
surprised he was your kind of guy,

13:48.074 --> 13:51.964
- even for a little while.
- It's tough for me to meet men.

13:51.999 --> 13:55.068
- You're surrounded by men.
- So are you.

13:57.471 --> 14:00.373
- Does that make it easier?
- Korsak: Was there anyone you know

14:00.407 --> 14:02.275
that might have wanted
to harm Mr. Harris?

14:02.309 --> 14:04.677
[Exhales deeply]

14:04.711 --> 14:08.681
[Scoffs]
[Sighs]

14:12.753 --> 14:15.188
That's a list of everyone
in the tournament.

14:15.222 --> 14:19.559
They were all jealous of Mark.
They accused him of cheating.

14:19.593 --> 14:23.162
- Did he cheat?
- Oh, Mark didn't know enough to cheat.

14:23.197 --> 14:26.265
- Unlike everyone on that list.
- So you're saying they're all cheaters?

14:26.300 --> 14:29.268
A fisherman's just a cheater
who hasn't been caught.

14:29.303 --> 14:31.437
It's another reason 
I don't date fishermen.

14:31.472 --> 14:34.140
Except Mark Harris.

14:34.174 --> 14:38.003
Well, he was a poet... who fished.

14:40.180 --> 14:42.548
My next batch is a really smelly one.

14:42.583 --> 14:44.450
[Clears throat] 
Well, uh, thank you for your time.

14:44.485 --> 14:46.719
- [Chuckles] Can I keep this?
- Sure. [Clears throat]

14:46.753 --> 14:49.555
[Door opens]

14:50.490 --> 14:52.158
Phew.

14:52.192 --> 14:56.162
No wonder the only empty spot
on the lot is next to that.

14:56.196 --> 14:58.297
Mark Harris doesn't strike
me as the kind of guy

14:58.332 --> 14:59.565
that would have have two beautiful,

14:59.600 --> 15:01.067
but totally different women in his life.

15:01.101 --> 15:05.705
- Well, women can see past looks.
- Yeah. Men can't.

15:05.739 --> 15:07.514
No, that's why we wear makeup and heels.

15:07.613 --> 15:10.047
Because you all like the shiny stuff.

15:10.210 --> 15:14.046
- Detective Rizzoli! Hi!
- Hello.

15:14.081 --> 15:17.750
I, uh ... I brought you a gift.
To help you with your case.

15:17.784 --> 15:19.652
- Thank you.
- It's a book on bass.

15:19.686 --> 15:22.588
And a split of champaigne.

15:22.623 --> 15:26.092
Now, you can have that yourself
or bring it down to my boat.

15:26.126 --> 15:28.761
We can drink it together,
watch the sunset, and talk fish.

15:28.795 --> 15:31.097
[Sighs]

15:31.131 --> 15:33.599
Skeet, I-I'm ... I'm sorry.
I ... [cellphone ringing]

15:33.634 --> 15:36.335
This is business.
But, please, think about it.

15:36.370 --> 15:39.372
<i>[Beep]
Hey, this is Skeet.</i>

15:39.406 --> 15:41.541
Shiny jacket.

15:46.580 --> 15:48.214
Shiny.

15:53.738 --> 15:56.706
- You rang?
- Yes.

15:56.741 --> 15:59.309
There is something very
interesting about the big fish

15:59.343 --> 16:02.178
that was found in Mark's
live well when he died.

16:02.213 --> 16:04.581
Is that the fish that
kept swimming toward me?

16:04.615 --> 16:06.182
- The cute one?
- Yes.

16:06.217 --> 16:10.553
You killed him because you were jealous.

16:10.588 --> 16:13.023
Well, he was sick.

16:13.057 --> 16:15.291
Which is why he kept
swimming around repetitively

16:15.326 --> 16:18.261
- and banging into the glass.
- Sick with love!

16:18.295 --> 16:20.163
[Chuckles] Well, I cured him.

16:22.166 --> 16:24.534
The DNA of the stomach contents

16:24.568 --> 16:29.005
shows that this fish
is not from this pond.

16:29.040 --> 16:31.408
And it ate plants not from this region.

16:31.442 --> 16:35.412
And he was bigger than the
bass found in this pond.

16:35.446 --> 16:38.148
So, either Mark found out
someone was cheating ...

16:38.182 --> 16:39.716
Or Mark was cheating.

16:41.585 --> 16:44.944
Give my friend a proper burial.

16:46.773 --> 16:50.898
Do you like fish tacos?
[Laughs]

16:55.682 --> 16:59.318
- What?
- Where's Frankie Jr. Jr.?

16:59.352 --> 17:02.321
[Scoffs] I had him with me,
ran down to the car,

17:02.355 --> 17:03.355
then Nina called and ...

17:03.390 --> 17:05.134
- You left him in the car?
- Yeah.

17:05.244 --> 17:07.785
- In a car seat?
- No.

17:07.901 --> 17:10.363
- With the windows rolled down?
- No.

17:10.494 --> 17:13.771
Poor Frankie Jr. Jr. gone too soon.
[Scoffs]

17:13.964 --> 17:16.732
- Another day with a flour baby for you.
- What?!

17:16.733 --> 17:20.405
- Another day.
- No way. Come on, Kor...

17:20.453 --> 17:23.689
Factoring in wind speed and
distance the bolt would travel,

17:23.723 --> 17:26.425
we're left with these
three suspects. [Beeping]

17:26.459 --> 17:29.828
Korsak: Boyd Jones,
Cliff Davis, Jay Butler.

17:29.862 --> 17:33.165
And all three were in striking
distance of first place.

17:33.199 --> 17:34.433
Jones and Davis have been brought in.

17:34.467 --> 17:37.869
- Jay Butler left the tournament early.
- Do we know where he is?

17:37.904 --> 17:39.705
No, but he's signed up for
a tournament in Northern Maine.

17:39.739 --> 17:41.440
Right near the Canadian border.

17:41.474 --> 17:45.343
- Yeah, I'll put a bolo out on him.
- Okay. [Sighs]

17:47.213 --> 17:50.315
- Korsak's making me ...
- I don't want to know. [Chuckles]

17:50.349 --> 17:53.752
Boyd Jones and Cliff Davis
are ready for questioning.

17:53.786 --> 17:58.119
Fun fact ... they were both
caught cheating in the past.

17:59.492 --> 18:01.326
- We'll interview them.
- Mm-hmm.

18:01.360 --> 18:02.961
- Let me know what you find out.
- Yeah.

18:02.995 --> 18:07.632
N-Nina? Would you mind keeping
an eye on Francesca for me?

18:08.434 --> 18:11.403
- Sure.
- How did you come up with "Francesca"?

18:11.437 --> 18:14.639
- Seriously?
- No. [Chuckles]

18:14.674 --> 18:17.409
[Horn honks]

18:17.443 --> 18:22.380
- Did you know Mark Harris?
- We fished in the same tournaments.

18:22.415 --> 18:23.615
If you call what he was doing "fishing."

18:23.649 --> 18:24.983
Brand-new to the sport,

18:25.017 --> 18:27.619
But he'd won three of the
last eight tournaments.

18:27.653 --> 18:29.287
Yeah, the guy's a poet.

18:29.322 --> 18:31.289
Were you friends with Mark Harris?

18:31.324 --> 18:34.359
"Friends"? 
Are you kidding me?

18:34.393 --> 18:35.527
[Scoffs] 
He combs our lakes.

18:35.561 --> 18:37.896
He takes our fish. 
He takes our women.

18:37.930 --> 18:45.504
- Uh, you mean, uh, Linda Hendrickson?
- I asked her out four times.

18:45.538 --> 18:48.507
Yeah, she thought she
was better than me.

18:48.541 --> 18:50.809
Sounds like that bothered you big time.

18:50.843 --> 18:52.911
Did he figure out you were cheating?

18:52.945 --> 18:55.514
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Oh, come on, sport.

18:55.548 --> 18:58.217
Two tournaments ago,
one of the fish you "caught"

18:58.218 --> 19:01.520
- was partially frozen.
- Hmm. Nature's mysterious.

19:01.554 --> 19:04.723
- You put weights down the
throats of your fish. - Allegedly.

19:04.757 --> 19:07.859
Uh, y-you had a secret storage
compartment in your boat.

19:07.894 --> 19:11.296
I say it was a cooler... for beer.

19:11.330 --> 19:12.430
Do you own a crossbow?

19:12.465 --> 19:14.866
- Of course.
- Don't you?

19:14.901 --> 19:20.891
Listen, I hope that you catch
whoever it is that killed this guy.

19:21.440 --> 19:22.941
And I hope you figure
out how he cheated.

19:24.021 --> 19:26.711
What makes you think he cheated?

19:26.746 --> 19:29.648
What do you think?
 Fish just jumping into his boat?

19:31.450 --> 19:34.719
- When you do...
- Would you tell me how he was doing it?

19:34.754 --> 19:39.824
- On the sly?
- I won't tell anyone.

19:44.931 --> 19:47.833
Hi.
Um, can you tell me

19:47.867 --> 19:49.568
where I might find
Detective Jane Rizzoli?

19:49.602 --> 19:54.606
- Her desk is in the squad room.
- Okay. Thanks.

19:55.741 --> 19:59.578
Are you, uh ... are you working
on that, uh, Mark Harris murder?

19:59.612 --> 20:01.012
I need you to leave.

20:01.047 --> 20:02.747
'Cause I was in that tournament.
So, if you need any ...

20:02.782 --> 20:04.349
Sir, I'm in the middle of
important police business,

20:04.383 --> 20:07.352
- and I don't have time for ...
- Thanks for watching Francesca for me.

20:07.386 --> 20:10.021
[Baby-talking] I am gonna
keep this flour baby alive.

20:10.056 --> 20:13.892
I'm not gonna give Korsak the satisfa...

20:13.926 --> 20:17.444
- [Clears throat] Hey.
- Hey.

20:23.311 --> 20:28.250
- There was a bet and...
- Well, uh, good luck

20:28.346 --> 20:31.557
- with that important police business.
- Mm-hmm.

20:36.596 --> 20:37.963
Linda was right.

20:37.997 --> 20:40.566
It was a lake full of
cheaters and wannabe cheaters

20:40.600 --> 20:41.934
and cheaters who
haven't been caught yet.

20:41.968 --> 20:45.604
Bassholes.
[Chuckles]

20:45.638 --> 20:47.659
You kiss your daughter with that mouth?

20:49.843 --> 20:51.977
[Sighs]

20:54.114 --> 20:55.681
[Telephone ringing]

20:55.715 --> 20:58.083
[Indistinct conversations]

20:58.118 --> 21:02.554
- Nice lamp.
- Oh. Yeah, the department's redecorating.

21:02.589 --> 21:06.625
- You get the matching chair.
- [Chuckles] How's the puzzle?

21:06.659 --> 21:08.494
<i>I feel like a piece is
missing out of the box.</i>

21:08.528 --> 21:11.697
Hmm.
Mark Harris made a $50,000 deposit

21:11.731 --> 21:13.132
the day before the tournament started.

21:13.166 --> 21:18.704
[Elevator bell dings] What?
From Big Rod's sporting goods.

21:18.738 --> 21:19.972
They hired Mark to be their spokesman

21:20.006 --> 21:24.710
- for their competition fishing line.
- Okay, this whole fishing thing ...

21:24.744 --> 21:26.979
I know, I've got to redo
my profile on Match.com

21:27.013 --> 21:29.114
to add "pro fishermen welcome."

21:29.149 --> 21:30.616
Wait a minute, after
the tournament started,

21:30.650 --> 21:32.985
he withdrew $50,000 ...
what's up with that?

21:33.019 --> 21:35.905
I don't know.
He got a money order for cash.

21:35.906 --> 21:39.925
- Maybe it's some sort of payoff.
- The same day he was killed?

21:39.959 --> 21:42.456
The same day Jay Butler disappeared.

21:48.293 --> 21:50.308
[Ducks quacking]

21:51.117 --> 21:53.718
<i>Jane: Did you know that
because of all the pollution,</i>

21:53.753 --> 21:55.487
the bass are changing sexes,

21:55.521 --> 21:59.624
- with the males carrying the eggs?
- Oh. It's about time.

21:59.659 --> 22:02.360
- You did not know that.
- Yes, I did.

22:02.395 --> 22:04.396
I read it in a science journal. You?

22:04.430 --> 22:06.398
I read it in that book Skeet gave me.

22:07.266 --> 22:08.400
Interesting.

22:08.434 --> 22:10.535
- Skeet?
- The book.

22:11.837 --> 22:15.540
And the picture...
he drew.

22:15.574 --> 22:18.777
- He put a sex drawing in a fish book?
- What is wrong with you?

22:18.811 --> 22:23.114
No he drew a picture of me fishing.
It's very flattering.

22:23.149 --> 22:25.250
Waders are a nice look on you.

22:25.284 --> 22:26.785
<i>Okay, what are we searching for, again?</i>

22:26.819 --> 22:29.304
<i>Evidence that the fish I autopsied was</i>

22:29.305 --> 22:31.790
<i>transported to and
somehow held in this lake.</i>

22:31.824 --> 22:34.526
Which might help us figure
out who planted it there.

22:34.560 --> 22:36.695
And that would lead us to the killer.

22:36.729 --> 22:40.231
- We discussed all this in the car.
- Did we?

22:40.266 --> 22:42.467
Oh, I see. You just
needed a break, didn't you?

22:42.501 --> 22:45.337
- No.
- [Chuckles] Okay.

22:45.371 --> 22:48.273
- I was just recapping.
- Mm-hmm.

22:48.307 --> 22:53.270
- Why can't we do this with a motor?
- Because it will scare the fish,

22:53.300 --> 22:55.962
and fear does not equal attraction.

22:56.136 --> 22:59.933
Which is so interesting about Skeet.
He's not afraid of you.

22:59.967 --> 23:03.536
- Well, I'm not interested in Skeet.
- Because you're afraid.

23:03.571 --> 23:06.439
I am not afraid of Skeet.

23:06.473 --> 23:08.975
No, you're just afraid that
Skeet doesn't look like

23:09.009 --> 23:10.610
what you thought you were looking for.

23:10.644 --> 23:13.880
Well, I'm not sure what I'm looking for,

23:13.914 --> 23:16.482
but I can tell you one thing ...
it's not Skeet.

23:16.517 --> 23:18.551
And if have to look at that jacket ...

23:18.586 --> 23:20.386
- Wait! Stop!
- What? You got to talk.

23:20.421 --> 23:21.888
- How come I don't get to say anything?
- No, no, no. No, no.

23:21.922 --> 23:23.323
- What?
- Look. Look, look, look.

23:23.357 --> 23:26.993
- Oh. Wow.
- Yeah. Okay.

23:30.200 --> 23:34.583
Okay.
Do not let me slip.

23:35.603 --> 23:37.870
Careful.

23:39.873 --> 23:44.477
- I think I know what those clips held.
- Big, big bass.

23:50.651 --> 23:54.487
Tell me why you left
the tournament early.

23:54.521 --> 23:56.623
Because of the thing with Mark.

23:56.657 --> 23:59.859
The "thing"?
You mean his murder?

23:59.948 --> 24:03.527
Yeah. Because of that,
he tried I was suspended.

24:03.548 --> 24:06.357
Well, you don't seem very upset
about Mark Harris' death.

24:06.391 --> 24:08.492
- We weren't friends.
- I got that.

24:08.527 --> 24:10.761
Look, I-I was upset 
that I wouldn't be able to fish.

24:10.796 --> 24:13.598
But I didn't know when it would
start again or if it would.

24:13.632 --> 24:17.468
Anyway, there ... there was no
way I could win, so I-I left.

24:17.502 --> 24:22.440
You finished second to
Mark Harris three times.

24:22.474 --> 24:25.751
<i>First place was $100,000.
Second place was $5,000.</i>

24:25.786 --> 24:29.313
- It had to make you angry.
- I don't play for second.

24:29.348 --> 24:31.015
- Especially not to Mark Harris.
- You're damn straight.

24:31.049 --> 24:32.617
It had to make you angry knowing that

24:32.651 --> 24:34.352
he was a better fisherman than you were.

24:34.386 --> 24:37.021
Mark Harris is a cheater!
All right?!

24:39.391 --> 24:45.363
- Okay. Tell me how he cheated.
- I-I don't know.

24:45.397 --> 24:47.031
But he won more than any of us,

24:47.065 --> 24:49.467
a-and he didn't know a damn
thing about bass fishing.

24:49.501 --> 24:51.035
Well, he knew enough to win.

24:51.069 --> 24:53.905
Look, Rosie Ruiz won
the Boston marathon.

24:53.939 --> 24:55.873
Lance Armstrong won the Tour de France.

24:55.908 --> 25:00.011
Fishing is a cruel mistress.
Nobody wins all the time.

25:00.045 --> 25:02.747
[Scoffs] God.
Mark Harris did.

25:03.281 --> 25:06.350
How many years have
you been a fisherman?

25:06.385 --> 25:07.485
[Sighs]

25:07.519 --> 25:10.021
My whole life.

25:10.055 --> 25:12.757
And that number will remain
private, if you don't mind.

25:12.791 --> 25:15.559
Ever cheated?
[Chuckles]

25:15.594 --> 25:18.763
Look, sometimes the rules change.
It takes a while to catch up.

25:18.797 --> 25:22.366
I don't know what Mark Harris did.

25:22.401 --> 25:26.804
But, if I was you, I would
talk to his girlfriend, Linda.

25:26.838 --> 25:29.707
- Ex-girlfriend.
- Ex?

25:29.741 --> 25:32.643
- Yeah. Rules change.
- Maybe.

25:32.678 --> 25:34.512
But someone didn't like it.

25:34.546 --> 25:37.782
I park my RV next to Linda's.
I had to move it.

25:37.816 --> 25:41.883
They were fighting all night.
I couldn't sleep.

25:48.560 --> 25:50.928
Thanks for coming in.

25:53.999 --> 25:56.067
[Telephone ringing]

25:56.101 --> 25:57.668
[Door closes]

25:57.703 --> 25:59.937
You think he's telling the truth?

25:59.972 --> 26:03.407
Well, the spot next to
Linda's RV was empty.

26:03.442 --> 26:08.412
- Could have been the smell.
- Maybe.

26:08.447 --> 26:15.413
It could also be that this murder
is not about fishing.

26:17.984 --> 26:21.786
- [Chuckles] Korsak?
- Yep.

26:21.821 --> 26:23.421
I'm not betting with him anymore.

26:23.456 --> 26:27.158
What did he make you do?
[Sighs]

26:27.193 --> 26:30.629
Oh! [Both chuckle]
That's horrible.

26:30.663 --> 26:33.565
Wait a minute. 
Is that Korsak's face?

26:33.599 --> 26:35.226
- On a Bolotianyk.
- A what?

26:35.261 --> 26:37.102
A swamp spirit from Slavic folklore.

26:37.136 --> 26:40.171
- It was supposed to be temporary.
- It's not?

26:40.206 --> 26:42.040
Korsak keeps finding ways
to tell me I've screwed up.

26:42.074 --> 26:44.509
It's been redrawn a bunch of times.

26:44.543 --> 26:45.844
How long have you had it?

26:45.878 --> 26:49.447
- [Elevator bell dings] Six months.
- Oh, my god.

26:49.482 --> 26:50.982
We should all know better
than to bet with Korsak.

26:51.017 --> 26:52.851
Well, I do now. Yeah.

26:52.885 --> 26:54.586
- Wait!
- Oh.

26:54.620 --> 26:56.855
Hey. [Chuckles]

26:56.889 --> 27:00.859
Lost a bet, huh?
[Sighs]

27:00.893 --> 27:03.161
Hey, Korsak!
I'm doing good!

27:03.195 --> 27:06.368
No more days for me!

27:06.499 --> 27:08.166
[Woman coughs]

27:08.200 --> 27:10.201
<i>Oh, come on.
[Coughs]</i>

27:10.236 --> 27:15.374
Let's not name the next one.
Hurts too bad when you fail.

27:17.050 --> 27:18.813
[Chuckling]

27:24.504 --> 27:27.940
If Jane asks, you rowed.

27:27.974 --> 27:30.943
You two have a unique
relationship, don't you?

27:30.977 --> 27:34.380
- I'm still trying to figure it out.
- Me too.

27:36.183 --> 27:38.017
So, do you know where we're going?

27:38.051 --> 27:43.389
- The spot where Mark caught his last fish.
- It still seems strange,

27:43.423 --> 27:45.491
this whole idea of fishing as a sport.

27:45.525 --> 27:48.994
Well, imagine how the fish feel.
[Chuckles]

27:49.029 --> 27:51.030
Do you follow any sports?

27:51.064 --> 27:54.967
The usual things ...
arm wrestling, the caber toss.

27:55.001 --> 28:00.373
- I can never tell when you're joking.
- I know.

28:05.712 --> 28:09.682
It's getting close.
Right around here.

28:09.716 --> 28:12.700
All right.
There it is.

28:14.554 --> 28:16.389
[Engine shuts off]

28:16.423 --> 28:18.657
[Ducks quacking]

28:18.692 --> 28:23.790
[Sighs]
[Splash]

28:25.793 --> 28:28.762
Can you give me a hand?

28:29.397 --> 28:32.032
[Grunting]

28:32.066 --> 28:33.700
Got it?

28:33.734 --> 28:36.436
Go! Be free!

28:36.470 --> 28:38.438
Until you bite down on
some shiny piece of plastic

28:38.472 --> 28:40.240
and somebody with a
brightly colored shirt

28:40.274 --> 28:42.926
pulls you from your
watery home, weighs you,

28:42.927 --> 28:45.578
measures you, and flings
you back into the air.

28:45.613 --> 28:47.180
Is that fish empathy

28:47.214 --> 28:49.749
or another indicator
of a bizarre world view?

28:49.784 --> 28:51.718
Um, bit of both, I guess.

28:54.221 --> 28:56.189
Huh.

28:56.223 --> 29:00.193
<i>This is probably the spot
where Mark was when he was shot.</i>

29:00.227 --> 29:05.065
Now, the bolt entered Mark Harris' back
just below his neck.

29:05.099 --> 29:06.533
If you were aiming from a boat,

29:06.567 --> 29:09.135
you would aim for the
largest area ... the back.

29:09.170 --> 29:13.640
And at 35 yards, the path
would drop about 10 inches.

29:13.674 --> 29:16.076
So if the crossbow was
fired from a boat ...

29:16.110 --> 29:20.113
Then the bolt would have
entered the victim's lower back.

29:25.653 --> 29:28.905
<i>Well, that rise is about 50
yards away ... well within range.</i>

29:28.940 --> 29:31.539
Starting with that hight
aiming over victim's head...

29:31.794 --> 29:36.631
The crossbow shot would have
dropped about 4 to 6 inches

29:36.665 --> 29:39.500
and lodged itself in
the victim's upper back.

29:39.535 --> 29:44.672
So Mark Harris was killed by
someone standing on the shore.

29:47.176 --> 29:49.410
[Telephone ringing]

29:49.445 --> 29:50.812
[Sighs]

29:50.846 --> 29:54.716
- Hey! Garcia! How are you?
- Oh, good. Thanks, Mrs. Rizzoli.

29:54.750 --> 29:58.286
- You look hungry.
- Well, starving, actually.

29:58.320 --> 29:59.654
Well, you're in luck
because I baked some goodies.

29:59.688 --> 30:01.522
- Oh.
- They're super healthy.

30:01.557 --> 30:04.792
I made them with cricket
flour, hemp, and agave.

30:04.827 --> 30:07.454
- Wow.
- Yeah, go ahead. Take one.

30:07.551 --> 30:09.664
Or, I mean, if you can't
decide, take a couple.

30:09.698 --> 30:11.199
[Sighs]

30:11.233 --> 30:14.269
I'm on a diet, but thanks
so much, Mrs. Rizzoli.

30:14.303 --> 30:18.439
What? Is everybody
on a diet around here?

30:20.709 --> 30:23.678
Hey, Nina.
Have you seen Frankie?

30:23.712 --> 30:27.682
No, I haven't.
[Sighs]

30:27.716 --> 30:31.185
Angela, I don't know what you're doing,
but you look fantastic.

30:31.720 --> 30:36.224
- Really?
- Really. [Both chuckle]

30:36.258 --> 30:40.428
I'm on this "nothing white" diet.
It's really strict.

30:40.462 --> 30:43.431
- Sounds impressive.
- Yeah. I hate it.

30:43.465 --> 30:46.301
I mean, all I want is
white bread, white pasta,

30:46.335 --> 30:50.638
- and a little sugar sprinkled on top.
- Hmm. [Beep]

30:50.673 --> 30:53.908
I'm sorry. I have to go.

30:53.942 --> 30:57.679
- Okay. Well, it was nice talking to you.
- You too.

31:04.820 --> 31:06.354
What the heck?

31:13.008 --> 31:17.011
Mark had a sponsorship deal
with Big Rod's sporting goods?

31:17.046 --> 31:21.549
- [Chuckles] I know.
- Why is that funny?

31:21.584 --> 31:23.017
Because it's amazing ... the irony.

31:23.052 --> 31:28.256
Mark, he didn't like to handle fish
when we had a barbecue. [door opens]

31:28.290 --> 31:32.293
It was a very lucrative deal.
He got a first payment of $50,000,

31:32.328 --> 31:35.530
which he withdrew the
day that he was killed.

31:35.564 --> 31:38.061
You have any idea what
happened to that money?

31:38.096 --> 31:39.996
I have it.

31:40.031 --> 31:43.166
He asked me to mail
the check in for him.

31:45.570 --> 31:49.272
- It's a lot of money.
- I know.

31:49.307 --> 31:51.007
Mark wanted to prove to me

31:51.042 --> 31:54.010
that he was making a
clean break from fishing,

31:54.045 --> 31:56.179
that he was committed to our marriage.

31:56.214 --> 31:59.416
And we didn't have financial problems.

31:59.450 --> 32:02.018
Does this have something to
do with why he was killed?

32:02.053 --> 32:03.553
That's what we're trying to figure out.

32:03.588 --> 32:08.725
I don't understand this.
I don't understand any of this.

32:12.830 --> 32:15.699
Thank you for coming in, Mrs. Harris.

32:18.069 --> 32:21.304
- Well, somebody's lying.
- Carla? [Elevator bell dings]

32:21.339 --> 32:25.709
- No. Everybody else. [Gasps]
- Jane!

32:25.743 --> 32:29.446
- I've got to go, uh, do that thing.
- Jerk. [Chuckles]

32:29.480 --> 32:32.315
[Clears throat]

32:32.350 --> 32:33.750
How do you keep getting in here?

32:33.785 --> 32:38.188
- I'm friendly.
- Okay.

32:38.222 --> 32:42.359
Hey, uh, look. I have a
reservation at Providence tonight.

32:42.393 --> 32:43.863
Have dinner with me.

32:44.017 --> 32:46.599
There's a two-week wait to
get a table at that place.

32:46.641 --> 32:52.457
- Well, they knew me. They serve fish.
- Okay, um, Skeet...

32:52.694 --> 32:58.266
- I don't want to go out with you.
- Why?

32:58.300 --> 33:02.337
- Because. [Button clicking]
- Okay. I hear you.

33:02.371 --> 33:04.372
I don't understand it, but I hear you.

33:05.274 --> 33:07.508
I mean, it's obvious
you're attracted to me.

33:07.543 --> 33:09.644
[Elevator bell dings]
Your respiration is elevated,

33:09.678 --> 33:12.558
your skin color's slightly red,
your pupils are dilated.

33:12.774 --> 33:19.487
Or... it's hot and I'm tired
and it's dark in the hallway.

33:19.521 --> 33:22.490
Jane, don't let your
head rule your heart!

33:22.524 --> 33:24.759
<i>Goodbye, Skeet.</i>

33:27.263 --> 33:28.963
What's up?

33:28.998 --> 33:32.300
I remodeled the flight projections
for the crossbow bolt.

33:32.334 --> 33:34.202
Given the rate of
drop per yard traveled,

33:34.236 --> 33:36.337
and the height of the entry
in the victim's back ...

33:36.372 --> 33:42.377
Maura, you're talking equations.
Jane don't like equations.

33:42.411 --> 33:45.380
The crossbow bolt
that killed Mark Harris

33:45.414 --> 33:48.950
was fired from the shore,
from a rise just behind the reeds.

33:48.984 --> 33:51.085
That's a good place to hide.

33:51.120 --> 33:52.453
And the height makes
up for the extra drop

33:52.488 --> 33:55.456
- with the added distance.
- That's what I was trying to say.

33:55.491 --> 33:57.025
[Elevator bell dings]

33:57.059 --> 33:59.327
You know, when Carla Harris
talked about Mark,

33:59.361 --> 34:03.331
her breathing was very even,
her pupils weren't dilated.

34:03.365 --> 34:06.334
She was probably grieving.

34:06.368 --> 34:09.337
But when Linda Hendrickson
talked about him,

34:09.371 --> 34:13.474
she got really red, her
breathing was very shallow.

34:13.509 --> 34:16.610
It's possible that she
was still in love with him

34:16.645 --> 34:22.389
- and he was going to leave her.
- Ain't love grand?

34:29.347 --> 34:33.049
Mark was taking a prescription
for blood thinners.

34:33.083 --> 34:34.650
Oh, yeah?

34:34.685 --> 34:36.052
[Inhales deeply]

34:36.087 --> 34:39.922
We found this receipt for coumadin.

34:39.956 --> 34:43.860
As it turns out, it was your
credit card that paid for it.

34:43.893 --> 34:47.641
- So?
- So that means you knew about it.

34:47.676 --> 34:50.344
Well, I don't understend
where this is going.

34:52.614 --> 34:57.185
Mark entered eight tournaments.

34:57.219 --> 34:59.720
You were not an
official for two of them,

34:59.755 --> 35:05.459
- where he finished 83rd and 95th.
- It happens.

35:05.494 --> 35:07.195
Yes, it does.

35:07.229 --> 35:11.999
In the six that did you officiate,
he won all of them.

35:12.034 --> 35:17.271
- So?
- Do you own a crossbow?

35:17.306 --> 35:20.141
[Chuckles]
Everyone owns a crossbow.

35:20.175 --> 35:28.149
Well, everyone does not own
a set of WS16 snow chains.

35:28.183 --> 35:29.784
[Chains rattling]

35:34.590 --> 35:37.558
[Gasps]
Korsak: That look familiar?

35:37.593 --> 35:39.694
Now, we're gonna piece
all of this together

35:39.728 --> 35:41.362
and trace it back to you.

35:41.396 --> 35:43.564
- The matching snow chain.
- The note you left on his hood ...

35:43.599 --> 35:49.070
- we'll find a draft on your hard drive.
- So... [clears throat]

35:49.104 --> 35:52.562
what happened, Linda?

35:54.679 --> 36:00.653
[Chuckles]
He... He was hopeless.

36:00.688 --> 36:05.074
He was so cute, but he
was human fish repellent.

36:05.108 --> 36:07.409
- You taught him to cheat?
- No.

36:07.444 --> 36:09.078
[Chair scrapes]

36:09.112 --> 36:12.148
So, you're saying he caught
those fish legitimately?

36:12.182 --> 36:15.551
- [Scoffs] No.
- You cheated for him.

36:15.585 --> 36:17.286
He never knew.

36:17.320 --> 36:20.556
You know, I changed the
weights on his tally sheet.

36:20.590 --> 36:23.692
I salted the waters where
I knew he'd be fishing.

36:23.727 --> 36:26.428
I snuck extra fish into his bait tank.

36:26.463 --> 36:30.032
See, he was a poet.
He saw what he wanted to see.

36:30.066 --> 36:36.572
- I just wanted him to be happy.
- What changed?

36:36.606 --> 36:39.441
[Voice breaking] The endorsement deal
with Big Rod's sporting goods.

36:39.476 --> 36:42.578
I mean, we could have been
king and queen of the lakes,

36:42.612 --> 36:45.314
but that wasn't enough for him.

36:45.348 --> 36:49.518
- And that made you angry.
- Oh, you think?

36:49.553 --> 36:54.123
They were gonna put Mark on the cover
of a sporting-goods catalogue

36:54.157 --> 36:56.792
so that other city guys
would buy more fishing rods.

36:56.827 --> 37:01.163
But me, with all of my knowledge,
I could never get that.

37:01.198 --> 37:06.404
I could never be the face
of Big Rod's, but he could.

37:06.469 --> 37:09.578
And I did that for him.

37:10.106 --> 37:14.210
I gave that to him.

37:14.244 --> 37:17.746
And he was throwing it all away.

37:17.781 --> 37:21.028
He was going back to his wife.

37:21.418 --> 37:26.522
- So you told him about the cheating?
- Well, I thought if ... if he knew,

37:26.556 --> 37:29.658
then he'd realize 
how much I l-loved him.

37:30.693 --> 37:35.155
But he said that he had to come clean.

37:36.566 --> 37:39.802
- Confess.
- Which would have exposed you.

37:41.838 --> 37:47.543
I would have lost
everything that I've built.

37:47.577 --> 37:51.280
[Inhales deeply] 
He was so ungrateful.

37:51.314 --> 37:58.487
- I mean, he had nothing to lose!
- Just his life.

38:06.296 --> 38:09.798
- Zzt!
- Uh, Jane!

38:09.833 --> 38:12.401
<i>And that is good work.</i>

38:12.435 --> 38:13.669
- Hey!
- Hi.

38:13.703 --> 38:18.807
- Hi.
- Look, I, uh, just came to say goodbye.

38:18.842 --> 38:22.845
And I'm sorry if...
I made you feel uncomfortable.

38:22.879 --> 38:26.849
[Sighs] 
No, Skeet, wh... look ...

38:26.883 --> 38:29.418
I-I know we're not going on a date,

38:29.452 --> 38:31.687
but would you at least
come out on my boat

38:31.721 --> 38:33.756
and watch the sunset with me?

38:33.790 --> 38:39.161
- [Sighs] I just don't have that kind of time.
- 10 minutes.

38:39.195 --> 38:42.231
Then I'm gone.
You'll never see me again.

38:42.265 --> 38:44.466
10 minutes.

38:47.470 --> 38:48.871
Clock it.

38:50.740 --> 38:55.611
You must know an amazing
shortcut to the water.

39:00.884 --> 39:06.583
Uh, I never said that we
were going to the water.

39:06.618 --> 39:10.187
- Seven minutes.
- Hmm.

39:10.221 --> 39:11.755
Thank you.

39:15.894 --> 39:20.631
- Gorgeous.
- [Sighs] Yeah.

39:22.534 --> 39:27.271
Um, okay. A toast.

39:27.305 --> 39:30.941
To Jane, who I will
forever be thinking about

39:30.976 --> 39:32.609
when I'm in my boat.

39:32.644 --> 39:33.911
[Glasses clink]

39:33.945 --> 39:36.880
Well, I don't really know about that.

39:36.915 --> 39:39.216
Well, I'll just have you
know that this little baby

39:39.250 --> 39:41.868
used to be called the Skeetster.

39:47.392 --> 39:49.893
[Chuckles]

39:49.928 --> 39:52.963
I thought it was bad luck
to change the name of a boat.

39:52.998 --> 39:57.901
I don't believe in luck.
I believe in attraction.

40:03.541 --> 40:06.944
Give me a call next
time you come to Boston.

40:09.547 --> 40:10.547
[Chuckles] 
[glasses clink]

40:10.548 --> 40:14.024
[Music]

40:24.629 --> 40:27.464
[Indistinct conversations]

40:27.499 --> 40:31.335
- So... Skeet?
- Mm. So what?

40:31.369 --> 40:33.670
Well, I think you find him alluring.

40:33.705 --> 40:38.409
Respiration increasing,
skin beginning to flush.

40:38.443 --> 40:41.678
Yes, doctor.
I am completely infatuated.

40:41.713 --> 40:43.680
Here you are.

40:43.715 --> 40:46.417
I don't think she understands
the laws of attraction.

40:46.451 --> 40:49.453
Shall I explain?
I'm sort of an expert.

40:49.487 --> 40:51.755
- How is that?
- I've been married three times.

40:51.790 --> 40:54.358
[Chuckles] So you get
them on the line, but...

40:54.392 --> 40:56.360
They wriggle away. 
[Chuckles]

40:56.394 --> 40:57.861
I got to work on that with Kiki.

40:57.896 --> 41:00.564
How much longer do I
have to be a flour daddy?

41:00.598 --> 41:03.467
To be decided ...
you killed the first two,

41:03.501 --> 41:04.735
and you don't even know
where the last one is yet.

41:04.769 --> 41:05.969
[Sighs]

41:09.674 --> 41:14.153
- Enjoy.
- They're white. Is that a trick?

41:14.715 --> 41:18.256
Nope. Vanilla cake.
Vanilla frost.

41:18.379 --> 41:19.437
Hmm. They look great.

41:19.539 --> 41:23.940
Yeah. I found a bag of flour at
the station... well I couldn't resist.

41:24.881 --> 41:27.148
You're done.
[Chuckles]

41:27.963 --> 41:31.381
Francesco the third, come to papa.

41:32.106 --> 41:34.912
Frankie!
With the paper and all?

41:35.077 --> 41:36.894
- What he's doing?
- [muffled] They're good!

41:37.012 --> 41:40.132
<i>- Maura: I'm going to love them.
- What?</i>
