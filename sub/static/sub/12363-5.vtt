00:05.439 --> 00:07.439
Walt,
adt security just called.

00:07.441 --> 00:09.441
There's been a break-in.

00:09.443 --> 00:10.976
Where?

00:10.978 --> 00:14.713
11601 ridge lane.

00:16.000 --> 00:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:58.658 --> 01:01.527
Don't shoot me,
sheriff.

01:01.529 --> 01:05.063
I'm unarmed...
among other things.

01:05.066 --> 01:08.167
What if the ferg
had answered this call?

01:08.169 --> 01:10.335
Well, then he'd have
quite a story to tell.

01:10.337 --> 01:12.504
But the ferg
didn't take the call.

01:12.506 --> 01:14.373
You did.

01:14.375 --> 01:16.075
About the only kind
of call

01:16.077 --> 01:18.410
I can get you to answer
these days.

01:18.412 --> 01:21.580
I know. It's, uh...Just with,
uh, the election, and...

01:21.582 --> 01:24.516
We're not talking
about any of that tonight.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.423
I thought you were
out of town.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.592
I was.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.300
Hello.

01:41.302 --> 01:44.203
No. No.
Everything's fine, ruby.

01:44.205 --> 01:47.106
False alarm.
Really?

01:47.108 --> 01:49.508
She wants to talk
to you.

01:53.213 --> 01:55.781
Ruby.

01:57.250 --> 01:59.551
Okay. On my way.

02:14.502 --> 02:16.902
More beer for me.

02:33.319 --> 02:35.654
You got to get down low
for a profile.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.222
You want to take
the pictures?

02:37.224 --> 02:40.092
What I want's a new truck...
like that one.

02:40.094 --> 02:42.494
Ferg, bounce one of those lights
off the wall.

02:42.496 --> 02:45.497
teacher's pet's gonna need
some shots of the tagging.

02:45.499 --> 02:48.167
Walt had to buy me a new
vehicle. Mine got totaled.

02:48.169 --> 02:51.503
Yeah, boo-hoo.

02:51.505 --> 02:54.606
Sorry I'm late.
I was answering another call.

02:54.608 --> 02:58.310
Could have stayed.
We got this.

02:58.312 --> 03:00.779
Well, then...Who did it?

03:02.749 --> 03:06.118
Store clerk found her
taking out the trash,

03:06.120 --> 03:08.587
Closing up shop
about an hour ago.

03:08.589 --> 03:09.888
Stiffness of the corpse

03:09.890 --> 03:12.424
And the purple discoloration
of her body

03:12.426 --> 03:16.528
Tells me she's been dead
more than 24 hours.

03:22.302 --> 03:25.637
Blood on her clothes.

03:25.639 --> 03:28.340
None on the ground.

03:28.342 --> 03:30.309
This body
was dumped here.

03:30.311 --> 03:31.610
That's what
I was saying.

03:31.612 --> 03:34.313
Entry wound is in
the side rib area.

03:34.315 --> 03:36.181
With all that blood,

03:36.183 --> 03:38.383
I'd say the bullet probably
punctured her heart.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.185
There's also bruising
on her face.

03:40.187 --> 03:42.221
She looks cheyenne.

03:42.223 --> 03:43.555
There's no I. D.,

03:43.557 --> 03:46.858
But I searched her pockets,
and I did find this.

03:46.860 --> 03:49.861
Sure as hell doesn't
look like aspirin.

03:49.863 --> 03:52.864
Given our location here,
and the gang signs,

03:52.866 --> 03:54.700
This might be
a drug-related murder.

03:54.702 --> 03:59.571
I also found a cellphone
in her other pocket.

03:59.573 --> 04:03.375
And this... a key.

04:08.848 --> 04:10.849
Branch, see if you can get
a billing address

04:10.851 --> 04:13.218
For that cellphone,
if you don't mind.

04:13.220 --> 04:14.586
We'll start there.

04:14.588 --> 04:15.821
Ferg,
you stay with the girl

04:15.823 --> 04:17.822
Till doc bloomfield
can get here.

04:17.825 --> 04:20.591
No one should be left
in an alley alone.

04:28.434 --> 04:31.303
This is the address.

04:31.305 --> 04:35.674
Phone company said the name
on the account is tanya dove.

04:42.815 --> 04:44.416
Allow me.

04:54.862 --> 04:56.428
You ready?

04:56.430 --> 04:58.930
Sheriff's department!
Sheriff's department!

04:58.932 --> 05:02.334
Think they heard you?

05:09.776 --> 05:13.679
Branch,
check the bedroom.

05:20.787 --> 05:24.489
Hey, walt.
This is tanya.

05:24.491 --> 05:26.658
This girl
has tanya's eyes.

05:26.660 --> 05:27.993
Maybe she's got
a sister.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.861
Looks like she's got
a couple.

05:29.863 --> 05:32.397
No guns or ammo,
but I did find this

05:32.399 --> 05:34.566
Wedged between
the mattress and the box spring.

05:34.568 --> 05:35.901
Oxy.

05:35.903 --> 05:39.271
Oxy...Codone.

05:39.273 --> 05:42.607
Prescription
for gerry solomon.

05:42.609 --> 05:43.975
No address.

05:43.977 --> 05:45.977
Maybe that's where our
pill fragment came from.

05:45.979 --> 05:48.847
Branch, since you found
gerry solomon's pill bottle,

05:48.849 --> 05:50.549
See if you can find
gerry solomon.

05:52.885 --> 05:54.619
Let me see tanya's phone.

05:54.621 --> 05:58.490
Thought you didn't know how to
work one of these things.

05:58.492 --> 06:00.826
Yeah,
I'm full of surprises.

06:00.828 --> 06:05.063
hmm. There's a lorna dove.

06:12.038 --> 06:13.739
Lorna's not answering.

06:13.741 --> 06:15.507
You got to check
the texts.

06:15.509 --> 06:17.843
Walt, nobody
calls each other anymore.

06:19.380 --> 06:21.380
You say that
like it's a good thing.

06:21.382 --> 06:24.549
Uh,
the name that pops up

06:24.551 --> 06:28.887
The most
on tanya's list is...

06:28.889 --> 06:31.857
Lucy samms.

06:31.859 --> 06:33.859
I knew something was weird.

06:33.861 --> 06:36.561
I haven't heard from tanya
in a couple days,

06:36.563 --> 06:40.966
But I-I just figured that
lorna took away her phone again.

06:40.968 --> 06:43.869
Is that something
lorna has done before?

06:43.871 --> 06:46.872
Yeah.

06:46.874 --> 06:48.707
She acts like
she's tanya's mother.

06:48.709 --> 06:50.809
She's not?

06:50.811 --> 06:53.478
Tanya's mom's in prison
and her dad's dead.

06:53.480 --> 06:56.982
I guess
'cause lorna's older,

06:56.984 --> 06:59.818
She's, like, in charge.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.787
Was tanya on
any medication or...?

07:01.789 --> 07:03.622
No, she wasn't sick
or anything.

07:03.624 --> 07:06.124
She take any drugs?
Hang on.

07:06.126 --> 07:08.727
What are you saying?
What she's saying

07:08.729 --> 07:11.663
Is we want to know
all we can about tanya.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.999
Tanya would have told me
if she was taking drugs.

07:14.001 --> 07:17.936
We told each other everything.
We're best friends.

07:17.938 --> 07:21.473
Do you know anyone who may have
had a problem with her?

07:21.475 --> 07:24.509
Boyfriends, ex-boyfriends?

07:24.511 --> 07:27.679
Tanya had a boyfriend...
justin bollman.

07:27.681 --> 07:29.648
But he's a sweetheart.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.450
We're gonna
talk to justin.

07:31.452 --> 07:35.454
Right now, we really need
to notify her family.

07:35.456 --> 07:37.789
Anyone know
where we can find lorna?

07:37.791 --> 07:39.591
She work nights or...?

07:39.593 --> 07:43.995
Lorna doesn't work.
She fights.

07:49.403 --> 07:51.736
Excuse me. Excuse me!

07:51.738 --> 07:53.438
We're looking
for lorna dove.

07:53.440 --> 07:54.606
I'm her trainer.

07:54.608 --> 07:55.774
We need to talk to her.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.709
Lorna's about to fight.

07:57.711 --> 08:00.545
I'd really rather talk
to her first. It's important.

08:00.547 --> 08:01.880
Can't it wait?

08:01.882 --> 08:03.648
The guy that runs this event
is a real prick.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.851
If she's late, he'll scratch
her event from the card.

08:05.853 --> 08:08.186
I'm just asking
for 15 minutes.

08:08.188 --> 08:10.622
Well, right after, then.

08:20.600 --> 08:23.468
Really pack 'em in to see
girls beat each other up.

08:23.470 --> 08:26.204
It's every man's
second fantasy.

08:29.842 --> 08:32.177
Vic, keep an eye
on the ring.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.880
Hello, henry.

08:34.881 --> 08:37.515
Strange to find you
so far from home.

08:37.518 --> 08:39.116
You startled me.

08:39.119 --> 08:41.186
Is that a manhattan?

08:43.789 --> 08:46.858
I have always
enjoyed manhattans.

08:53.799 --> 08:55.734
Oh, party's over!

08:57.837 --> 09:00.071
Deena,
what brings you to town?

09:00.073 --> 09:01.540
I had a nine-ball tournament
in cheyenne,

09:01.542 --> 09:02.774
And I can't come
through cheyenne

09:02.776 --> 09:05.644
Without thinking
about my warrior.

09:05.646 --> 09:06.978
All right,
all right, all right!

09:06.980 --> 09:08.213
Enjoy the fight.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.916
Our first
flyweight event tonight

09:10.918 --> 09:14.786
Features a local favorite...
michelle breen.

09:14.788 --> 09:17.956
And from over in durant...
lorna dove!

09:17.958 --> 09:19.624
give it up!

09:25.731 --> 09:27.232
Who's the hottie
with henry?

09:27.234 --> 09:28.600
Nobody.

09:53.192 --> 09:54.826
One round.

09:55.861 --> 09:57.228
The girl's tough.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.604
All right, lorna's gonna
change and then come out and talk to you.

10:05.606 --> 10:07.172
I'm kind of in a hurry.

10:20.786 --> 10:24.856
Hey! Hey!

10:33.766 --> 10:35.634
So, I've been watching
lorna dove's apartment since last night.

10:35.636 --> 10:37.702
Still no sign of her.

10:37.704 --> 10:39.037
I mean,
should I keep waiting,

10:39.039 --> 10:41.039
Or should I go check out
the boyfriend's house?

10:41.041 --> 10:42.574
You stay put.
We're heading there.

10:42.576 --> 10:43.942
Just making
a stop first.

10:43.944 --> 10:46.177
You call me immediately
if lorna shows up.

10:46.179 --> 10:48.046
You got it.

10:48.048 --> 10:50.982
Hi.
Excuse us.

10:52.918 --> 10:54.953
Can I help you?

10:54.955 --> 10:57.288
Yeah, I'm wondering
if a tanya dove

10:57.290 --> 10:59.290
Has any prescriptions
on file.

10:59.292 --> 11:01.159
Let me take a look.
Tanya with an "a"?

11:01.161 --> 11:03.228
Yeah.

11:04.297 --> 11:05.764
uh, aside from

11:05.766 --> 11:08.099
A course of antibiotics
a year ago,

11:08.101 --> 11:09.934
We haven't filled
anything for her.

11:09.936 --> 11:12.237
What about her sister,
lorna?

11:12.239 --> 11:14.339
nope.

11:18.144 --> 11:21.079
Can you tell me
if this is oxycodone?

11:23.015 --> 11:26.718
Oh, it's hard to tell...
looks generic.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.053
What makes you think
it's oxy?

11:31.023 --> 11:34.025
We found this
at tanya's home.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.194
I know gerry solomon.

11:36.196 --> 11:39.364
He came in here a month ago
after back surgery.

11:39.366 --> 11:40.765
What's he got to do
with this?

11:40.767 --> 11:42.100
That's what
we're wondering.

11:42.102 --> 11:43.802
Now, if you have
any way to figure out

11:43.804 --> 11:45.236
If that pill
came from that bottle,

11:45.238 --> 11:47.405
You'd be saving us a long drive
to the crime lab.

11:47.407 --> 11:49.841
Sure, I'll look that up
for you.

11:51.310 --> 11:54.846
So, I'm sure gerry solomon's
a really nice old man.

11:54.848 --> 11:56.181
But he wouldn't be
the first person

11:56.183 --> 11:57.716
To try and turn
a $10 co-pay

11:57.718 --> 12:00.218
Into some extra money
by selling his pills.

12:00.220 --> 12:04.222
Okay, it's generic,
but it's not oxy.

12:04.224 --> 12:07.392
It's... here.
It's hydrocodone.

12:07.394 --> 12:10.395
Uh, it's similar to oxy,
but this is definitely not

12:10.397 --> 12:11.996
What gerry walked out with
last month.

12:11.998 --> 12:15.366
Appreciate your time.

12:15.368 --> 12:18.103
Hey, vic.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.971
You find
the pill-bottle guy?

12:19.973 --> 12:21.339
Gerry solomon?

12:21.341 --> 12:23.341
Not yet.
He wasn't home.

12:23.343 --> 12:26.211
Left my card and a note
on his door,

12:26.213 --> 12:28.313
A message on gerry's
answering machine.

12:28.315 --> 12:30.415
He and walt must be
the only guys left

12:30.417 --> 12:31.850
Who still use
answering machines.

12:31.852 --> 12:33.718
So, where are you?

12:33.720 --> 12:34.986
Going to talk
to tanya's boyfriend,

12:34.988 --> 12:36.221
If that's okay
with you.

12:36.223 --> 12:39.257
So, vic...
Does walt seem nervous?

12:39.259 --> 12:41.960
Why?

12:41.962 --> 12:44.295
Town-hall debate's
just a week away.

12:44.297 --> 12:45.764
It's game time.

12:45.766 --> 12:48.166
Walt's never been
a big public speaker,

12:48.168 --> 12:50.869
- So I was just wondering if he's getting nervous.
- I'm fine, Branch.

12:52.071 --> 12:53.905
Hey, sheriff.

12:53.907 --> 12:56.074
Any sign of the sister that
got away from you last night?

12:56.076 --> 12:58.176
Just let us know
when you find gerry solomon.

12:58.178 --> 12:59.444
Hang that up.

13:04.251 --> 13:06.184
So, tanya
was your girlfriend?

13:06.186 --> 13:08.820
How long had you two
been dating?

13:08.822 --> 13:11.956
Six-month anniversary was
coming up in a couple weeks.

13:11.958 --> 13:15.760
She was practically
part of the family.

13:15.762 --> 13:18.163
Family. So, are you close
with tanya's sister, as well?

13:18.165 --> 13:19.197
Not really.

13:19.199 --> 13:20.965
Neither was tanya.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.801
So, justin...

13:22.803 --> 13:26.771
You aware of much recreational
drug use at the high school?

13:26.773 --> 13:30.108
I've heard some kids
are on xanax, and...

13:30.110 --> 13:32.377
Other stuff during finals.

13:32.379 --> 13:34.045
Tanya ever take
any pills?

13:34.047 --> 13:37.081
What? No.

13:37.083 --> 13:39.484
No, no, she...
she wasn't into that stuff.

13:39.486 --> 13:43.188
Did she ever mention someone
named gerry solomon?

13:43.190 --> 13:44.355
No.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.090
Who's gerry solomon?

13:46.092 --> 13:48.827
He's a friend of the family
we're trying to locate.

13:48.829 --> 13:51.129
Do you think
he did this?

13:51.131 --> 13:52.997
We're not sure.

13:52.999 --> 13:55.500
Now, we did notice
some bruises on her face.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.502
Do you know where
those came from?

13:57.504 --> 14:02.507
Tanya and lorna...

14:02.509 --> 14:04.409
They used to get
into fights.

14:04.411 --> 14:06.244
Real fights.

14:06.246 --> 14:09.480
I don't know if I should
say this, but, uh...

14:09.482 --> 14:12.550
Lorna had
addiction issues.

14:14.887 --> 14:16.554
She could have relapsed,

14:16.556 --> 14:19.490
And if she lost control
of herself...

14:22.895 --> 14:26.064
I- I don't want to
think about it.

14:26.066 --> 14:28.266
We need to find lorna.

14:28.268 --> 14:29.968
She can't stay away
from home forever.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.135
You saw it, right?

14:31.137 --> 14:32.837
Justin was high.

14:32.839 --> 14:34.005
Just checking.

14:34.007 --> 14:36.307
His mom
seemed oblivious.

14:36.309 --> 14:38.109
Could you tell when your
daughter was high or drinking?

14:38.111 --> 14:40.245
We never had that problem
in our house.

14:40.247 --> 14:42.947
Every parent
thinks that.

14:42.949 --> 14:45.884
Every kid thinks
they're getting away with it.

14:50.923 --> 14:53.258
Cady?

14:53.260 --> 14:56.895
Cady longmire?

14:56.897 --> 14:58.029
Hi!

14:58.031 --> 14:59.898
I'm lizzie.
Hi.

14:59.900 --> 15:01.900
Lizzie ambrose.

15:01.902 --> 15:03.167
Hi, I'm cady...

15:03.169 --> 15:05.003
Which, apparently,
you already know.

15:05.005 --> 15:06.337
I've been bugging your dad
to introduce us

15:06.339 --> 15:07.605
For the longest time.

15:07.607 --> 15:10.041
Really? W-why?

15:10.043 --> 15:11.409
Oh.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.845
Well, I-I assumed
he would have mentioned me.

15:13.847 --> 15:18.549
We've been...Seeing each other
from time to time.

15:18.551 --> 15:20.184
Oh, well.
You know your dad.

15:20.186 --> 15:23.221
Yeah.

15:23.223 --> 15:25.990
Well, it was great
to finally meet you, cady.

15:25.992 --> 15:28.626
Yeah, it was...
it was great.

15:30.262 --> 15:32.263
Bye.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.364
Bye.

15:44.511 --> 15:47.912
Go ahead. Say it.

15:47.914 --> 15:49.480
What are you
talking about?

15:49.482 --> 15:52.016
Deena.

15:53.085 --> 15:57.288
Henry, please.
Deena's great.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.890
And you know
what they say, uh...

15:58.892 --> 16:00.258
Fifth time's the charm.

16:00.260 --> 16:03.361
You buy a ring this time,
or maybe another piano?

16:03.363 --> 16:05.997
She wanted
to take lessons!

16:07.233 --> 16:09.167
Ow!

16:09.169 --> 16:10.668
Is this why you came here...
to judge me?

16:10.670 --> 16:12.303
Not the only reason.

16:12.305 --> 16:15.173
I'm trying to find this
fight trainer named jack shaw.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.141
Trains a girl
named lorna dove.

16:17.143 --> 16:19.177
She the girl who was
fighting last night?

16:19.179 --> 16:22.513
Uh-huh. I asked around several
gyms in the county... nothing.

16:22.515 --> 16:24.682
I was thinking maybe
he worked out on the res.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.384
There is a boxing club
on the res.

16:26.386 --> 16:28.386
I can make a call.
See if they have heard of jack.

16:28.388 --> 16:31.389
Hey, walt,
you want to play me?

16:31.391 --> 16:32.690
I'll beat your ass.

16:32.692 --> 16:35.393
Sorry.
I got work to do.

16:35.395 --> 16:38.062
Uh, she's all yours.

16:47.439 --> 16:51.275
Lorna dove.

16:51.277 --> 16:53.444
Okay, lorna,
let's take five.

16:53.446 --> 16:57.015
Hey! We need to
talk to you.

17:02.689 --> 17:05.990
Why did you run off
in such a hurry the other night?

17:05.992 --> 17:07.290
It was my baby's bedtime,
all right?

17:07.292 --> 17:08.626
I didn't have time
to sit around and chat.

17:08.627 --> 17:10.161
But you didn't go home.

17:10.163 --> 17:12.163
We really need to ask you
some questions

17:12.165 --> 17:13.330
About your sister
tanya.

17:14.501 --> 17:16.467
She's dead.
What else is there to say?

17:17.636 --> 17:19.670
Why don't you step out
of the ring so we can talk?

17:21.205 --> 17:24.075
No, thanks. I'm done talking.
Jack, let's go.

17:24.077 --> 17:26.411
Jack, put 'em up!

17:26.413 --> 17:28.613
Look. We can talk here, or I can
bring you into the station.

17:32.051 --> 17:35.553
Fine. You want to spar?
Let's spar.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.155
Vic.

17:37.157 --> 17:41.292
But if I win, you talk.

18:24.703 --> 18:27.572
I'm ready to talk now.

18:27.574 --> 18:29.740
How did you know
tanya was dead?

18:29.742 --> 18:31.542
That kind of news
gets around.

18:31.544 --> 18:34.245
Where did you go
last night, lorna?

18:34.247 --> 18:35.713
When I saw you at the bar,

18:35.715 --> 18:38.416
I figured tanya was
in some kind of trouble.

18:38.418 --> 18:41.752
I thought that
if I could find tanya,

18:41.754 --> 18:45.456
Maybe I can get her out of
whatever mess she was in.

18:45.458 --> 18:48.793
But...Then I talked
to her boyfriend,

18:48.795 --> 18:50.428
And I found out what
really happened.

18:50.430 --> 18:53.798
After I found out,
I just drove.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.801
You know, the car
helps the baby sleep.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.669
Then I came here
and slept.

18:58.671 --> 19:01.772
You know, it's quieter here
at night than in my apartment.

19:03.375 --> 19:05.543
Any idea
where these came from?

19:05.545 --> 19:07.545
Yeah.

19:07.547 --> 19:09.413
A guy named
gerry solomon.

19:09.415 --> 19:12.416
This was in your house.
Is it yours?

19:12.418 --> 19:14.285
No.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.087
Is it your sister's?

19:16.089 --> 19:18.589
I don't know.

19:18.591 --> 19:21.125
I tried to keep her
out of trouble,

19:21.127 --> 19:24.128
But I came home a couple weeks
ago, and she was high.

19:24.130 --> 19:28.299
Tanya said it was no big deal.
It was just painkillers.

19:28.301 --> 19:30.468
But once you start
down that road,

19:30.470 --> 19:33.471
It's tough to turn back.

19:33.473 --> 19:37.475
I know. I was messed up.
But I-I turned my life around.

19:37.477 --> 19:39.877
Now, I'm just trying
to scare tanya straight.

19:39.879 --> 19:44.115
I heard you may have
hit tanya before.

19:44.117 --> 19:46.751
Is that true?
Who told you that?

19:46.753 --> 19:49.387
That kind of news
gets around.

19:49.389 --> 19:52.723
After I found out
about the painkillers,

19:52.725 --> 19:56.594
I signed tanya up for a rehab
outpatient program on the res,

19:56.596 --> 19:59.597
But tanya blew it off.

19:59.599 --> 20:02.266
We got into an argument,
and I hit her.

20:02.268 --> 20:03.834
I told her if she was gonna
get high on painkillers,

20:03.836 --> 20:06.237
Then she was gonna have to
feel a little pain.

20:06.239 --> 20:09.607
So you admit to
beating your sister.

20:09.609 --> 20:13.477
and when we came to talk
to you about it, you fled.

20:13.479 --> 20:15.479
Lorna was fighting
the night that tanya died.

20:15.481 --> 20:19.150
So there's no way she could have
done this terrible thing.

20:19.152 --> 20:20.685
Go find
who killed tanya.

20:20.687 --> 20:22.687
Lorna and me...

20:22.689 --> 20:25.389
...Got training to do.

20:27.793 --> 20:29.660
My brain's
a little mushy,

20:29.662 --> 20:31.829
But tanya didn't die
the night she was found.

20:31.831 --> 20:33.831
She died at least
24 hours earlier.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.533
Yep.

20:35.535 --> 20:37.535
And if tanya and lorna's
fights at home

20:37.537 --> 20:38.736
Were 1/10 of what
I just felt,

20:38.738 --> 20:40.338
It could have gotten
out of hand.

20:40.340 --> 20:42.373
We should check and see
if lorna has any guns.

20:43.576 --> 20:44.742
How do you endure
this much pain

20:44.744 --> 20:46.310
And not take
any painkillers?

20:46.312 --> 20:47.712
I don't know
how lorna does it.

20:51.483 --> 20:54.485
Maybe she doesn't.

20:56.588 --> 20:57.722
Ruby.

20:57.724 --> 20:59.724
Hey, sheriff.
Lizzie called.

20:59.726 --> 21:02.593
And vic wanted you to know
that she couldn't find

21:02.595 --> 21:04.929
Any guns purchased
by lorna dove.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.931
<i>And a reporter
from the durant courant</i>

21:06.933 --> 21:09.800
Wanted a quote from you about
the town-hall debate next week.

21:09.802 --> 21:11.269
Thanks, ruby.

21:11.271 --> 21:12.770
And I look forward
to the opportunity

21:12.772 --> 21:14.472
To share my ideas
for a modern approach

21:14.474 --> 21:15.640
To law enforcement.

21:15.642 --> 21:19.810
<i>no, thank you.</i>

21:19.812 --> 21:21.979
what's up?

21:21.981 --> 21:23.981
I was hoping, after you're done
talking to the press,

21:23.983 --> 21:26.517
You'd, uh,
apply your modern approach

21:26.519 --> 21:29.220
To finding gerry solomon.

21:29.222 --> 21:30.388
Who are you?

21:30.390 --> 21:31.756
I'm gerry solomon.

21:31.758 --> 21:35.626
Uh, deputy connally said
you wanted to talk to me.

21:35.628 --> 21:37.528
I do.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.769
you been out of town,
mr. Solomon?

21:44.771 --> 21:46.937
Well, I've been spending
a few weeks with my daughter

21:46.939 --> 21:48.439
Over in ten sleep.

21:48.441 --> 21:49.874
What's this all about,
sheriff?

21:49.876 --> 21:51.709
I'm interested in your
oxycodone prescription.

21:51.711 --> 21:54.245
Now, we found this somewhere
it shouldn't have been.

21:54.247 --> 21:56.247
Well, I really
shouldn't say anything.

21:56.249 --> 21:57.648
I- I don't
want any trouble.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.984
Actually, gerry,
the way things stand,

21:59.986 --> 22:01.485
You already got trouble.

22:01.487 --> 22:03.421
Now, the best way
to shake it

22:03.423 --> 22:04.822
Is to tell me
what you know.

22:06.693 --> 22:08.793
Three weeks ago,
some kids broke into my house

22:08.795 --> 22:10.461
In the middle
of the night.

22:10.463 --> 22:13.798
All they wanted was my pills,
and they knew I had them.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.499
Was this girl
one of them?

22:15.501 --> 22:16.834
No.

22:16.836 --> 22:18.269
How about her?

22:18.271 --> 22:19.770
No.
They were all boys.

22:19.772 --> 22:22.773
Why didn't you file
a police report?

22:22.775 --> 22:23.941
Well, they said
if I called the police,

22:23.943 --> 22:25.042
They'd come back
and kill me.

22:25.044 --> 22:27.411
I was scared, sheriff.

22:27.413 --> 22:29.447
That's why I've been staying
with my daughter.

22:29.449 --> 22:32.783
I'm gonna need you to look
at some pictures,

22:32.785 --> 22:35.319
See if you recognize the people
that stole your pills.

22:35.321 --> 22:36.987
Well, I don't think I can,
sheriff.

22:36.989 --> 22:39.623
I- I'm sorry. I can't.

22:39.625 --> 22:43.627
Gerry, those pills
seem to be involved

22:43.629 --> 22:45.429
In a wrongful death.

22:45.431 --> 22:47.965
And if you can't point out
for us who stole them,

22:47.967 --> 22:50.835
We're gonna have to assume
that you sold them illegally.

22:50.837 --> 22:53.938
Did you, gerry?

22:56.976 --> 22:58.776
Yo, yo...
give 'em back.

23:00.513 --> 23:01.912
That look like him?

23:03.315 --> 23:04.982
Yeah.

23:04.984 --> 23:06.984
How is it that kids out here
in the middle of nowhere

23:06.986 --> 23:09.520
Still manage to look like
philly gangsters?

23:09.522 --> 23:12.690
They all watch
the same tv shows.

23:12.692 --> 23:14.592
Boys,
we have a problem.

23:14.594 --> 23:15.926
We ain't got a problem.

23:15.928 --> 23:17.561
Yeah, we do.

23:17.563 --> 23:20.531
We need to know who you've been
selling drugs to.

23:20.533 --> 23:21.999
The only thing we ever sold
was magazine subscriptions

23:22.001 --> 23:24.001
To help out our school.

23:24.003 --> 23:26.737
That ain't easy.
It's a digital age.

23:27.706 --> 23:30.574
Here's another thing
that ain't easy...

23:30.576 --> 23:32.910
That's doing time
for breaking and entering

23:32.912 --> 23:34.779
And murder.

23:34.781 --> 23:36.881
Unless you start
answering my questions,

23:36.883 --> 23:38.916
You can kiss
your digital life goodbye.

23:38.918 --> 23:43.020
So, you ever sell
any magazines to tanya dove?

23:44.356 --> 23:47.625
Nah, man. We used to sell it
to her older sister.

23:47.627 --> 23:50.961
Lorna dove used to be
a real reader.

23:50.963 --> 23:53.497
That girl loved
her magazines.

23:53.499 --> 23:54.999
And then she got
all cleaned up,

23:55.001 --> 23:56.734
And she came and she made it
real clear to us

23:56.736 --> 23:59.737
She didn't want us selling
no magazine subscriptions

23:59.739 --> 24:01.005
To her little sister.

24:01.007 --> 24:03.007
So you never sold drugs
to tanya?

24:03.009 --> 24:04.475
<i>Magazines.</i>

24:05.444 --> 24:07.445
One time.

24:07.447 --> 24:09.847
But then lorna got all up
in our grill about it.

24:09.849 --> 24:12.149
Like I said,
she was a good customer.

24:12.151 --> 24:14.785
You got to reward loyalty.

24:14.787 --> 24:17.021
So we don't sell no magazines
to tanya no more.

24:17.023 --> 24:21.158
Plus, we didn't need some girl
going all mma on us.

24:21.160 --> 24:24.061
We ain't fighters.
We're lovers.

24:26.566 --> 24:29.467
What about this guy?

24:29.469 --> 24:31.001
mclovin!

24:31.003 --> 24:32.670
Mclovin?

24:32.672 --> 24:35.439
He's a nerd from a movie.

24:35.441 --> 24:39.009
What kind of magazines
you sell to mclovin?

24:39.011 --> 24:40.711
You lied to me, justin.

24:40.713 --> 24:42.413
You told me you didn't know
anything about drugs,

24:42.415 --> 24:43.914
Then I find out you're
buying them on the street.

24:43.916 --> 24:45.549
No,
I- I didn't buy any...

24:45.551 --> 24:47.551
I don't have the patience
for more dishonesty, justin.

24:47.553 --> 24:49.553
So unless you want me
to go tell your mother

24:49.555 --> 24:51.055
That you're
buying and taking drugs,

24:51.057 --> 24:55.593
You'll start answering
my questions right now.

24:55.595 --> 24:57.561
Please,
don't tell my mom.

24:57.563 --> 25:03.067
Okay, so, yeah,
tanya kind of liked to party.

25:03.069 --> 25:05.569
I bought her some stuff
a couple of times.

25:05.571 --> 25:06.904
Like oxycodone?

25:08.206 --> 25:11.075
Those guys wouldn't
sell to tanya.

25:11.077 --> 25:12.877
They were afraid lorna
would go ape-shit.

25:12.879 --> 25:16.080
Watch your language.
When did you buy those?

25:20.118 --> 25:22.653
Uh, a couple weeks ago.

25:22.655 --> 25:25.823
You buy anything more recently,
like oxy- or hydrocodone?

25:25.825 --> 25:28.792
No. She wanted me to.

25:28.794 --> 25:31.462
Tanya ran out of pills,
and she was jonesing.

25:31.464 --> 25:35.132
But buying oxy
off of gangbangers

25:35.134 --> 25:37.134
Kind of freaked me out.

25:37.136 --> 25:39.003
Listen, if tanya
had pills on her,

25:39.005 --> 25:40.170
I don't know
how she got 'em.

25:40.172 --> 25:42.239
I don't know.

25:42.241 --> 25:44.942
I wasn't telling you the truth
before, but I am now.

25:46.978 --> 25:50.848
Tell me one more thing,
justin.

25:50.850 --> 25:52.550
You ran out of pills.

25:52.552 --> 25:54.885
You didn't have anything
to give tanya.

25:54.887 --> 25:57.788
What were you on yesterday
when we interviewed you?

25:59.658 --> 26:01.158
Pot.

26:01.160 --> 26:04.528
Friend gave me a joint
when he found out about tanya.

26:04.530 --> 26:07.231
You're not gonna tell my mom,
are you?

26:13.239 --> 26:14.939
Lizzie.
Hey.

26:14.941 --> 26:16.807
Ah, hi!

26:16.809 --> 26:18.809
Oh, I am so sorry

26:18.811 --> 26:20.144
About interrupting
your special night.

26:20.146 --> 26:21.612
Oh, that wasn't
your fault.

26:21.614 --> 26:22.880
I only hope you didn't
get in trouble

26:22.882 --> 26:24.582
For your part
in my little plan.

26:24.584 --> 26:26.250
Walt hasn't even
mentioned it yet.

26:26.252 --> 26:27.785
What are you two
talking about?

26:27.787 --> 26:28.953
Nothing.

26:28.955 --> 26:30.788
That's what concerns me.

26:30.790 --> 26:32.723
I actually came
to talk to you.

26:36.127 --> 26:42.132
First of all, I'm sorry
about the whole...False alarm.

26:42.134 --> 26:44.001
I hope you're not
too mad.

26:44.003 --> 26:46.003
Well, truth be told,
that's the...

26:46.005 --> 26:48.572
That's the best home-invasion
call I've ever gone on.

26:48.574 --> 26:50.874
Good.
You said "first of all."

26:50.876 --> 26:53.043
Usually means there's
more than one topic.

26:53.045 --> 26:56.013
Yeah. Why haven't you told
your daughter about us?

26:56.015 --> 26:58.582
How do you know what cady
knows or doesn't know?

26:58.584 --> 26:59.850
I ran into her today.

26:59.852 --> 27:03.654
Today?
Here, in durant?

27:03.656 --> 27:04.788
Yeah.

27:04.790 --> 27:06.190
How do you know
what she looks like?

27:06.192 --> 27:08.192
Well, not from you
introducing us, obviously,

27:08.194 --> 27:09.693
But you do have
pictures of her.

27:18.036 --> 27:19.803
Huh.
Is that my gift?

27:21.606 --> 27:23.607
Uh...

27:23.609 --> 27:27.778
I'm sorry. I-I haven't had
a chance to, uh, um...

27:27.780 --> 27:30.114
I wanted you to be here
when I... when I opened it.

27:30.116 --> 27:31.815
Um, you know what?

27:31.817 --> 27:34.151
I'm... I'm sorry.
You're absolutely right.

27:34.153 --> 27:35.853
I should tell cady
about you.

27:35.855 --> 27:38.122
In fact, I should do it
right now.

27:47.165 --> 27:48.599
How do you know
she is back?

27:48.601 --> 27:50.768
Lizzie just saw her
on the street.

27:50.770 --> 27:53.270
I tried calling, I went by
her house, but nothing.

27:53.272 --> 27:56.640
You heard from her?

27:56.642 --> 27:58.776
Not since the one e-mail
last month.

27:58.778 --> 28:00.110
You seen her?

28:00.112 --> 28:01.812
You're not scared
to tell me, are you?

28:01.814 --> 28:03.814
I am not.

28:05.116 --> 28:08.252
Why would she not come
to talk to either one of us?

28:08.254 --> 28:11.655
Sheriff longmire.

28:11.657 --> 28:13.357
Oh. Sorry.

28:13.359 --> 28:14.825
Uh, there's a call
on line one.

28:14.827 --> 28:16.960
Would you like me
to take a message?

28:25.070 --> 28:28.238
Lorna just threatened
tanya's friend lucy samms.

28:28.240 --> 28:29.339
The best fighters
don't always

28:29.341 --> 28:31.041
Make the best people,
sheriff.

28:31.043 --> 28:32.743
But lorna's got
a good heart.

28:32.745 --> 28:35.913
She's harassing people.
Where is she, jack?

28:35.915 --> 28:38.415
She left the little one with me
a couple hours ago,

28:38.417 --> 28:40.284
Said she'd be up later
to pick her up.

28:40.286 --> 28:44.021
Can't you leave her be?
She's been through a lot.

28:44.023 --> 28:47.024
Doesn't put her outside the law.
Do you know where she is?

28:47.026 --> 28:48.892
no.

28:48.894 --> 28:51.061
But I'm gonna
look for her right now,

28:51.063 --> 28:53.330
So don't hassle me.

28:56.134 --> 28:57.835
You said she was
coming back here.

28:57.837 --> 28:59.336
I don't feel like
waiting.

28:59.338 --> 29:01.171
Then I'll come with you.

29:19.958 --> 29:22.826
I never tapped out.

29:32.070 --> 29:35.773
I'm sorry.

29:35.775 --> 29:38.509
Did you do
something wrong?

29:40.011 --> 29:43.881
I didn't take
good enough care of her.

29:43.883 --> 29:47.718
Right now we need to focus on
taking care of you.

29:47.720 --> 29:50.888
So, tell me
what happened to you.

29:50.890 --> 29:54.892
I was so angry...
About tanya,

29:54.894 --> 30:00.898
I- I couldn't
think straight.

30:00.900 --> 30:03.233
It was like I was

30:03.235 --> 30:07.471
Looking at the world
through a tunnel...

30:08.940 --> 30:11.175
...And everything else
was black.

30:13.411 --> 30:16.947
I know how that feels.

30:16.949 --> 30:18.949
I just knew somebody

30:18.951 --> 30:22.186
Had to pay
for what happened to her.

30:23.388 --> 30:25.255
Who did this?

30:25.257 --> 30:30.861
And after I threw
the first few punches...

30:32.864 --> 30:36.934
...I remembered my baby...

30:38.837 --> 30:42.506
...And how I had to
get back

30:42.508 --> 30:44.875
And take care of her.

30:44.877 --> 30:48.212
But...

30:48.214 --> 30:52.416
It was too late.

30:52.418 --> 30:58.088
They were already
beating on me.

30:58.090 --> 31:02.793
There was
so many of them.

31:02.795 --> 31:05.462
How many?

31:15.074 --> 31:17.174
Stop! Turn around,
get on your knees.

31:17.176 --> 31:19.209
- Hands up! Back up!
- Get your hands up!

31:19.211 --> 31:20.444
Back it up.
Let's go!

31:20.446 --> 31:22.045
You want to buy
a magazine?

31:22.047 --> 31:24.915
Yo, I got rights, man!

31:24.917 --> 31:27.284
You got all kinds
of rights...

31:27.286 --> 31:28.952
The right
to remain silent,

31:28.954 --> 31:30.387
The right to a lawyer,
et cetera.

31:30.389 --> 31:31.855
I'm sure you've heard
it before!

31:31.857 --> 31:34.358
You don't have the right
to beat a girl!

31:34.360 --> 31:37.361
You don't have the right to have
your two buddies

31:37.363 --> 31:39.062
Hold her down while you
kick her in the ribs!

31:39.064 --> 31:42.366
Ferg!

31:42.368 --> 31:44.902
And you don't have the right
to scream racial slurs

31:44.904 --> 31:48.906
While you punch her
in the face!

31:48.908 --> 31:51.174
Hands behind your back.

31:51.176 --> 31:52.976
Come here.
Come here!

31:52.978 --> 31:54.845
Aah!

31:59.984 --> 32:02.853
You're the only one without
bruises on your knuckles.

32:02.855 --> 32:04.988
So I know you didn't
hit lorna.

32:04.990 --> 32:06.924
So I'm gonna give you
a chance

32:06.926 --> 32:09.927
That the rest of them
won't get.

32:09.929 --> 32:12.596
You tell me who killed
lorna's little sister,

32:12.598 --> 32:15.599
And I won't charge you
with murder

32:15.601 --> 32:17.134
Like the rest
of your buddies.

32:17.136 --> 32:20.003
I never killed anyone.

32:20.005 --> 32:21.905
Then why was lorna so sure
that you and your friends did?

32:21.907 --> 32:23.307
I don't know.

32:23.309 --> 32:25.375
Tanya owe you money?

32:25.377 --> 32:27.377
No... we only sold
to her the one time,

32:27.379 --> 32:28.512
And she paid up.

32:28.514 --> 32:30.380
What about your supplier?

32:30.382 --> 32:31.982
Could tanya have gone
straight to him?

32:31.984 --> 32:35.319
Come on.
We ain't got no supplier.

32:35.321 --> 32:37.387
We steal 'em,
and we sell 'em.

32:37.389 --> 32:39.423
How do you know
who's got the drugs?

32:39.425 --> 32:42.426
How do you know which houses
to rob?

32:42.428 --> 32:45.028
We got a deal
with the pharmacist.

32:45.030 --> 32:46.530
We pay him, and he gives us
the addresses of old people

32:46.532 --> 32:49.900
Who fill big prescriptions
for painkillers.

32:49.902 --> 32:52.235
And we bust in,
we steal the pills,

32:52.237 --> 32:54.237
And then we sell 'em
for 10 bucks a pill.

32:54.239 --> 32:56.473
No one's supposed to
get hurt.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.342
Come on.

33:07.585 --> 33:09.586
You kind of
disappeared there, cady.

33:09.588 --> 33:12.589
I just...

33:12.591 --> 33:15.192
Wanted to make sure
it wasn't 'cause of me.

33:15.194 --> 33:17.627
It wasn't.

33:17.629 --> 33:19.663
You want to take a beat
on that?

33:21.366 --> 33:25.202
so, where you been?

33:27.305 --> 33:29.006
All over.

33:29.008 --> 33:32.642
Portland, san francisco,
denver.

33:32.644 --> 33:36.179
Denver?
Mm-hmm.

33:36.181 --> 33:37.681
What did you do
in denver?

33:37.683 --> 33:41.585
Nothing worth
talking about.

33:41.587 --> 33:45.288
Yeah, well,
if you ever do

33:45.290 --> 33:49.626
Need to talk
about anything...

33:49.628 --> 33:51.261
I'm here.

33:53.231 --> 33:55.298
I know.

33:58.069 --> 34:02.105
You know I'm not gonna
invite you in, right?

34:05.144 --> 34:06.209
I know.
Okay.

34:06.211 --> 34:09.545
I'm... I'm just glad
you're home.

34:09.547 --> 34:13.382
And I'm hoping,

34:13.385 --> 34:16.386
No matter what happens
with all this that...

34:16.388 --> 34:19.723
We can find a way
to be friends.

34:19.725 --> 34:22.492
Or, at least,
friendly.

34:26.330 --> 34:27.664
Don't forget your sign.

34:30.668 --> 34:32.735
You sure?

34:43.081 --> 34:46.248
I got plenty.

34:57.428 --> 34:59.596
I need you to shut down
for a minute,

34:59.598 --> 35:01.665
Let me in the back.

35:04.769 --> 35:06.770
Look, I-I know it's not okay,
but I swear,

35:06.772 --> 35:08.772
I told those guys
if anybody ever gets hurt,

35:08.774 --> 35:10.440
This arrangement is over.

35:10.442 --> 35:12.442
That's very noble
of you, gene.

35:12.444 --> 35:14.411
These drugs...
these are covered by

35:14.413 --> 35:15.779
Insurance companies
and medicare.

35:15.781 --> 35:18.148
All anybody has to do
is refill their scrips.

35:18.150 --> 35:19.349
There's no harm, no foul.

35:19.351 --> 35:20.617
A girl is dead.

35:20.619 --> 35:22.219
I had nothing to do
with that.

35:24.723 --> 35:27.090
No, no, no, no, no.
I can't go to jail.

35:27.092 --> 35:29.259
I'll tell you anything
you want to know.

35:29.261 --> 35:30.660
Okay.

35:30.662 --> 35:33.363
You give me a list
of all the names

35:33.365 --> 35:35.532
You sold to those gangsters,

35:35.534 --> 35:38.068
And all the hydrocodone
prescriptions you've filled

35:38.070 --> 35:39.636
In the last two months.

36:29.554 --> 36:30.854
So, barbara,
you recently filled

36:30.856 --> 36:33.223
- A big prescription for hydrocodone.
- Yes.

36:33.225 --> 36:36.226
We found the same generic
in tanya's pocket.

36:36.228 --> 36:38.862
Also found a key
to your house.

36:40.131 --> 36:42.299
You know justin and his girlfriend
were stealing your pills?

36:42.301 --> 36:44.301
No, no, no, no. That's not...
that's not true, okay?

36:44.303 --> 36:45.702
One time she suggested
that we go through

36:45.704 --> 36:48.271
The medicine cabinet
for pills... I said no.

36:48.273 --> 36:50.774
Then how did the pills
get in tanya's pocket?

36:50.776 --> 36:51.875
I don't know.

36:51.877 --> 36:53.710
Well, one of you does.

36:53.712 --> 36:57.247
I- I didn't give tanya
any pills.

36:57.249 --> 36:59.249
Maybe you didn't give them
to her. But she took them.

36:59.251 --> 37:02.252
And one of you
stopped her.

37:02.254 --> 37:04.821
I don't understand.

37:19.804 --> 37:24.341
Spackle.
Still not fully set.

37:24.343 --> 37:27.210
That's what happens when you try
to fill a hole this size.

37:27.212 --> 37:28.878
I'll bet it's the same size
as that bullet

37:28.880 --> 37:32.882
That entered tanya's side,
hit her heart.

37:37.421 --> 37:42.425
And I'm guessing there used to
be a nice area rug here.

37:42.427 --> 37:44.527
Covered in blood now,
probably.

37:44.529 --> 37:47.731
Which one of you
threw it out?

37:47.733 --> 37:49.966
One of you gonna tell me,
or should I guess?

37:51.235 --> 37:53.570
Okay, I'll just guess.
Justin.

37:53.572 --> 37:54.604
No! No, wait!

37:54.606 --> 37:56.606
Let's go.
Wait! Wait!

37:56.608 --> 37:58.875
Wait! I thought she was
an intruder!

37:58.877 --> 38:00.744
I woke up, and I saw somebody
in the room.

38:00.746 --> 38:03.280
I thought it was a man.
And he went into the bathroom.

38:03.282 --> 38:05.615
I was so...
I was so scared.

38:05.617 --> 38:07.951
So I-I took the gun
from the side table,

38:07.953 --> 38:09.819
And when he came out,
I shot him.

38:09.821 --> 38:11.688
Stop saying "him"!

38:11.690 --> 38:14.858
It's not until I got close
that I realized it was tanya.

38:14.860 --> 38:16.926
Please, justin,
I'm so sorry!

38:16.928 --> 38:20.297
I'm so sorry, justin.
It was just self-defense.

38:20.299 --> 38:21.531
So why didn't you just
call the police

38:21.533 --> 38:23.667
After the shooting,
barbara?

38:23.669 --> 38:26.002
Because I didn't...
I didn't want...

38:26.004 --> 38:29.239
Justin, I didn't want you
to hate me.

38:29.241 --> 38:32.676
I didn't want to lose
my son this way.

38:32.678 --> 38:35.545
You were at a friend's house
that night,

38:35.547 --> 38:37.881
And I thought,
if I could just hide her,

38:37.883 --> 38:39.616
That you would not
have to know.

38:39.618 --> 38:43.753
So I-I took the pills
out of her sweatshirt pocket.

38:43.755 --> 38:46.022
You must have missed one.

38:46.024 --> 38:49.559
and then I used the rug

38:49.561 --> 38:54.030
To drag her out to the car,
and I put her in the trunk.

38:54.032 --> 38:57.567
And then I-I took her
to the alley,

38:57.569 --> 38:59.002
And I left her there.

38:59.004 --> 39:00.637
You assumed people
would blame drug dealers.

39:00.639 --> 39:01.971
Yes!

39:01.973 --> 39:03.673
Yes, and they should,

39:03.675 --> 39:05.675
Because it was drugs
that killed her!

39:08.813 --> 39:11.514
Maybe you're right.

39:11.516 --> 39:12.849
The night
of the shooting,

39:12.851 --> 39:14.517
You had any of those pills
of yours?

39:18.022 --> 39:19.723
Yes.

39:19.725 --> 39:22.726
My doctor prescribed them
for me.

39:22.728 --> 39:24.060
'cause I can't help
but think,

39:24.062 --> 39:26.596
If you'd been
a little more clearheaded,

39:26.598 --> 39:30.567
You might not have shot
tanya dove.

39:30.569 --> 39:34.037
I'm so sorry.

40:40.971 --> 40:44.707
Lizzie seems nice.

40:44.709 --> 40:48.411
She, uh...
She is, um...

40:48.413 --> 40:50.747
We're not really dating.

40:50.749 --> 40:54.617
Um, not quite. Uh...

40:54.619 --> 40:56.119
I'm not sure what
you'd call it, but, uh...

40:56.121 --> 40:59.656
Dad.
relax. It's okay.

40:59.658 --> 41:02.826
I'm, uh... I'm sure
you would have told me...

41:02.828 --> 41:04.994
You know, eventually.

41:18.108 --> 41:19.809
You know,
you were right...

41:19.811 --> 41:24.047
About how I'd feel once I knew
the truth about mom.

41:30.789 --> 41:33.189
You want to talk
about it?

41:35.693 --> 41:39.095
Eventually.

41:43.200 --> 41:45.735
Where you been, punk?

41:45.737 --> 41:48.905
Portland.
San Francisco.

41:48.907 --> 41:50.807
Denver.

41:57.448 --> 42:00.016
Dad, I need you
to tell me something.

42:02.786 --> 42:06.823
Are you ever gonna
finish this cabin?

42:11.161 --> 42:15.265
Only if you
come around more.

42:18.903 --> 42:20.770
Promise me.

42:20.772 --> 42:23.907
I promise.

42:23.909 --> 42:26.609
Good.

42:27.305 --> 42:33.632
