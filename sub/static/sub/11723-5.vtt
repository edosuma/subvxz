<i>Previously
on</i> Penny Dreadful...

00:10.697 --> 00:12.820
<i>You chase this son
of a bitch from London</i>

00:12.845 --> 00:14.776
to here in the middle
of the Devil's asshole

00:14.777 --> 00:16.017
because it's your duty?

00:16.149 --> 00:17.899
<i>I think there's more to Mr. Talbot</i>

00:17.924 --> 00:19.046
<i>than meets the eye.</i>

00:20.388 --> 00:21.438
<i>There's the tragedy of it.</i>

00:21.463 --> 00:23.284
The serum only lasts
a matter of hours...

00:23.285 --> 00:24.375
<i>and then they revert.</i>

00:24.376 --> 00:26.477
I believe I can increase the
duration of the change,

00:26.478 --> 00:27.806
perhaps even render it permanent.

00:27.853 --> 00:29.813
We'll create a choir of angels.

00:29.838 --> 00:31.680
<i>One in particular.</i>

00:31.728 --> 00:33.735
If we cannot save our son,

00:33.760 --> 00:35.791
the darkness will overcome the Earth.

00:35.792 --> 00:37.954
And all our days will come to an end.

00:40.017 --> 00:41.147
<i>Once we go into the desert,</i>

00:41.148 --> 00:41.931
we don't stop.

00:41.970 --> 00:43.931
- And then?
- My father.

00:43.932 --> 00:45.032
A homecoming, is it?

00:45.385 --> 00:46.475
Why are you here?

00:46.476 --> 00:48.497
I want to liberate your truest self...

00:48.498 --> 00:50.939
The beast that prowls around your heart.

00:51.163 --> 00:54.106
I want to rule the
darkness at your side.

02:45.247 --> 02:47.895
How long until we
reach your father's ranch?

02:48.043 --> 02:50.065
A couple of
days' hard travel yet.

02:52.224 --> 02:54.205
There's a riverbed in that canyon.

02:54.649 --> 02:55.839
We let the horses drink.

02:55.864 --> 02:57.358
We rest a few hours, that's it.

03:01.263 --> 03:03.385
Looks like the
marshals haven't given up.

03:06.248 --> 03:07.349
Go!

03:15.407 --> 03:17.418
How many men?

03:17.419 --> 03:20.461
Twelve. Maybe more. Pursuing Ethan.

03:20.462 --> 03:23.244
We shall be upon them by nightfall.

03:23.245 --> 03:25.356
Our horses won't survive the pace.

03:25.357 --> 03:28.310
I intend to acquire new horses.

03:33.755 --> 03:35.998
You mean to murder every
last one of them.

03:36.988 --> 03:40.747
Those men stand between
us and that demon

03:40.772 --> 03:43.704
that seeks to corrupt Ethan's soul.

03:45.583 --> 03:47.594
To save my son,

03:47.595 --> 03:49.717
I would slaughter an entire army.

03:50.863 --> 03:53.434
And I would gladly give up my own life.

03:54.652 --> 03:56.774
Would he do the same for you?

03:56.775 --> 04:00.638
Ethan will kill me the
first chance he gets.

04:31.147 --> 04:32.856
There used to be a river here.

04:37.595 --> 04:39.616
Is there another source of water?

04:39.617 --> 04:40.749
Not for days.

04:52.680 --> 04:55.712
What'd happened between
you and your father?

04:58.787 --> 05:00.789
Why risk your life to face him now?

05:02.781 --> 05:05.683
Why does he send man after
man to hunt you down?

05:07.776 --> 05:09.737
He wants me to answer
for what I've done.

05:10.576 --> 05:12.518
Was your sin that grave?

05:15.424 --> 05:16.515
Yes.

05:19.061 --> 05:21.063
Such guilt you carry.

05:22.414 --> 05:24.614
This shame, it hangs around your neck.

05:25.794 --> 05:28.856
The only decent thing about
me is the shame I feel.

05:28.857 --> 05:31.780
Oh, spoken like a true servant of God.

05:32.720 --> 05:37.207
This God, that would
anoint you Lupus Dei...

05:37.745 --> 05:40.737
That would make you a glorious monster,

05:40.738 --> 05:43.641
and have you hate yourself
for being so monstrous.

05:44.332 --> 05:45.883
He tortures you with guilt,

05:45.884 --> 05:47.816
and in return offers you what?

05:49.717 --> 05:50.888
Forgiveness.

05:50.889 --> 05:52.740
Do you feel forgiven?

05:54.682 --> 05:57.725
There is only one way to
free yourself of guilt.

05:58.817 --> 06:00.698
Embrace your sins.

06:20.296 --> 06:23.019
Hey, is that necessary?

06:23.044 --> 06:25.015
I assure you, I mean you no harm.

06:25.016 --> 06:27.117
It's not for our safety, old boy.
It's for yours.

06:27.142 --> 06:28.629
What is this? What are you doing?

06:28.654 --> 06:31.777
Dr. Jekyll's serum has proven
remarkably effective...

06:31.802 --> 06:33.773
at curing your mania,

06:33.981 --> 06:35.091
and incipient aggression.

06:37.515 --> 06:38.566
Unfortunately...

06:39.320 --> 06:42.489
its efficacy is but a few hours.

06:43.154 --> 06:45.045
Really, Henry.

06:45.046 --> 06:46.997
Relying on the sluggish
bloodstream to deliver

06:46.998 --> 06:48.068
an impure compound?

06:49.950 --> 06:51.061
Little wonder your patient suffered

06:51.062 --> 06:53.034
vestigial memories of the
trauma you inflicted.

06:54.892 --> 06:56.924
I've developed a superior method...

06:59.080 --> 07:01.102
to purify the serum...

07:03.124 --> 07:04.986
prolong its effectiveness.

07:05.590 --> 07:07.581
How long?

07:07.918 --> 07:09.019
Permanently.

07:09.020 --> 07:11.161
You will be cured.

07:11.162 --> 07:13.114
We'll see, won't we, old sport?

07:15.006 --> 07:16.897
What's the method?

07:20.181 --> 07:24.044
I'm going to inject
an electrified dosage

07:24.045 --> 07:27.027
into the prefrontal
cortex of your brain.

07:27.028 --> 07:28.098
All right.

07:28.099 --> 07:29.939
Open your mouth.

07:29.940 --> 07:31.011
No.

07:36.964 --> 07:39.076
That'll be all, Doctor, thank you.

08:08.189 --> 08:10.111
You will have no memory of this.

08:11.112 --> 08:13.203
Not of this treatment,

08:13.204 --> 08:16.036
nor of your crimes, nor of your sins,

08:16.037 --> 08:18.249
nor of your time in this horrid place.

08:22.611 --> 08:25.793
Every moment that
has benighted your life

08:26.247 --> 08:28.219
and set you on your dark course...

08:29.976 --> 08:31.868
I will take from you.

08:34.592 --> 08:36.590
You will re-enter this world...

08:37.541 --> 08:38.732
an innocent lamb.

08:44.909 --> 08:46.941
After all...

08:48.269 --> 08:50.260
it is our memories

08:50.261 --> 08:52.152
which make us monsters...

08:53.204 --> 08:55.116
is it not?

09:35.498 --> 09:37.310
How'd you lose your arm?

09:39.362 --> 09:41.164
In battle.

09:45.733 --> 09:48.284
My regiment was in pursuit
of a Boer assassin.

09:48.543 --> 09:51.356
Tracked him across half the Transvaal.

09:51.565 --> 09:53.767
Finally, we thought we
had him cornered but...

09:55.561 --> 09:56.732
Well...

09:59.350 --> 10:01.202
it was an ambush.

10:04.245 --> 10:06.356
Only four of us survived.

10:06.357 --> 10:08.279
And then?

10:09.290 --> 10:11.292
I cauterized the wound...

10:13.660 --> 10:16.603
left my surviving companions behind...

10:17.925 --> 10:20.067
and continued to track the assassin.

10:21.332 --> 10:22.760
And before long,

10:22.785 --> 10:23.996
I caught up with him.

10:26.723 --> 10:31.127
And I dragged him to
Cape Town in chains.

10:35.027 --> 10:37.089
And then I reported to the infirmary.

10:51.322 --> 10:54.760
I'll admit... I'm
envious of their fire.

10:55.316 --> 10:57.407
A bit cavalier, though, don't you think?

10:57.408 --> 11:00.261
Out there in the open,
taunting their prey.

11:01.862 --> 11:04.151
There's no need to hide when
you've got the numbers.

11:05.509 --> 11:07.451
Ah, but do they?

11:17.454 --> 11:19.336
He's dying of thirst.

11:23.427 --> 11:25.289
We will, too.

11:36.095 --> 11:37.116
What is it?

11:38.429 --> 11:41.361
I just didn't take you
for a lover of animals.

11:43.195 --> 11:46.088
I adore all the honest
creatures of this world.

11:47.172 --> 11:49.054
It's humans I hate.

11:51.013 --> 11:52.681
Where'd you learn to ride?

11:54.033 --> 11:56.034
Equestrian competitions, mostly.

11:56.277 --> 11:58.428
Should we find ourselves
in a steeplechase,

11:58.429 --> 12:00.381
I shall acquit myself bravely.

12:02.052 --> 12:03.143
And you?

12:05.776 --> 12:07.220
My father.

12:09.462 --> 12:12.245
I suspect we're not so
different, you and I.

12:13.421 --> 12:15.183
Is that right?

12:16.141 --> 12:18.163
I didn't choose the master I serve.

12:19.340 --> 12:22.403
My mother enlisted me.

12:24.085 --> 12:27.088
She watched as Lucifer raked
his claws across my body.

12:28.940 --> 12:30.500
You think you know pain?

12:31.853 --> 12:33.454
I was five years old.

12:35.426 --> 12:36.907
It's something, isn't it?

12:36.932 --> 12:39.885
To be betrayed by the person
who's supposed to protect you?

12:44.012 --> 12:46.995
My father enlisted me in the army.

12:48.626 --> 12:50.301
Wanted to make a man of me.

12:51.279 --> 12:53.230
But I could've refused.

12:53.277 --> 12:55.169
I could've deserted.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.410
Well, why didn't you?

12:58.779 --> 13:00.711
I wanted to make him proud.

13:04.705 --> 13:08.290
My commanding officer
was a senator's son.

13:11.452 --> 13:13.264
Cruel son of a bitch.

13:14.131 --> 13:15.806
One day,

13:15.831 --> 13:17.427
we came across an Apache band

13:17.428 --> 13:19.320
who was camped near that river.

13:22.209 --> 13:24.230
We attacked them at dawn

13:24.255 --> 13:26.317
while they were still sleeping, mostly.

13:30.511 --> 13:32.413
The first one I killed...

13:34.485 --> 13:36.497
she's just standing there.

13:37.914 --> 13:39.956
I keep waiting for her to run.

13:43.548 --> 13:47.492
I raise my gun and I pull the trigger.

13:49.021 --> 13:51.023
And then I move on to the next.

13:52.225 --> 13:53.326
And the next.

13:58.489 --> 13:59.569
After it's all over,

13:59.570 --> 14:00.900
I go to the river to try and wash

14:00.925 --> 14:03.047
the blood off my hands.

14:07.063 --> 14:08.558
My commanding officer

14:08.559 --> 14:11.332
drags the body of this boy he's killed.

14:12.083 --> 14:14.782
The boy's face has been
bashed in with a rock.

14:15.556 --> 14:18.389
He says, "He wasn't worth the bullet."

14:19.520 --> 14:22.483
Then he dumps the body in the
river to poison the water.

14:24.052 --> 14:26.184
Looks at me and smiles.

14:28.215 --> 14:30.297
"They'll give us medals
for this, Ethan."

14:33.993 --> 14:36.423
I walked up to him and I
shot him in the head.

14:37.334 --> 14:39.176
Then I mount up,

14:39.984 --> 14:41.945
ride into the last Apache stronghold

14:41.970 --> 14:44.001
and beg them to take my scalp.

14:46.462 --> 14:49.385
Ethan came to me, wanting to die.

14:49.934 --> 14:52.976
He wanted to atone for his sins...

14:53.149 --> 14:55.191
For the slaughter of my family.

14:56.313 --> 14:59.376
But I thought it was
crueler to make him live.

15:00.419 --> 15:02.280
So I forced him to fight

15:02.305 --> 15:04.486
the same army he had served.

15:04.767 --> 15:05.847
This much he owed

15:05.872 --> 15:08.695
for what he had done to my people.

15:09.399 --> 15:11.962
But Ethan took to it.

15:12.543 --> 15:14.259
He fought like a man

15:14.284 --> 15:16.845
desperate to redeem himself,

15:16.870 --> 15:18.070
or to die.

15:18.710 --> 15:22.494
When Ethan first came to me,

15:22.782 --> 15:25.364
there were 39 of us left.

15:25.389 --> 15:28.522
Thirty-nine free Apaches
in all the world.

15:29.660 --> 15:34.485
And the army sent 5, 000
soldiers to hunt us down.

15:35.092 --> 15:37.233
For every 10 soldiers we killed,

15:37.539 --> 15:39.610
100 took their place.

15:40.159 --> 15:42.932
We were hunted things.

15:43.317 --> 15:45.438
We found no sleep at night

15:45.666 --> 15:47.618
and no peace at dawn.

15:48.174 --> 15:52.634
And so my tribe died, man by man.

15:53.765 --> 15:55.826
And as we died,

15:56.108 --> 15:58.080
we turned cruel...

15:58.472 --> 16:01.205
Did monstrous things.

16:05.618 --> 16:07.479
<i>Whatever you did in the army...</i>

16:07.504 --> 16:09.626
Whatever the Indians made you do...

16:11.041 --> 16:12.042
Know this...

16:12.416 --> 16:15.358
God watched it all unfold and laughed.

16:16.053 --> 16:18.105
This is the world he's made.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.502
We can create a world of our own, Ethan.

16:24.094 --> 16:25.610
And at your command,

16:26.115 --> 16:28.579
I can call forth the
creatures of the night.

16:29.909 --> 16:32.977
An army just beneath the
surface of the sand.

16:34.656 --> 16:37.589
Shall I summon them to
strike down our enemies?

16:38.202 --> 16:41.813
Shall we unleash demons, thee and me?

16:44.393 --> 16:45.696
Yes.

16:46.557 --> 16:48.648
You get their horses.

16:48.649 --> 16:50.681
I'll take care of anyone in our way.

16:51.338 --> 16:53.310
And kill them all.

17:27.191 --> 17:28.332
Give me your hand.

17:30.564 --> 17:32.666
Your blood has the power, not mine.

19:19.517 --> 19:21.368
Don't move.

21:19.940 --> 21:21.781
Listen.

21:23.269 --> 21:25.877
Such music my master makes.

21:48.909 --> 21:52.002
Twenty-four hours, not the
slightest sign of regression.

21:52.003 --> 21:53.158
Nor of consciousness.

21:53.183 --> 21:55.195
You've rendered the old boy catatonic.

21:55.754 --> 21:57.614
A bit excessive with the
voltage, wouldn't you say?

21:57.771 --> 22:00.684
You sound like one of our
old dons at Cambridge.

22:01.023 --> 22:03.362
"I find your methods
questionable, Victor."

22:03.387 --> 22:05.021
God, how they disapproved of your work.

22:05.046 --> 22:06.618
- And yours.
- No, Victor.

22:06.643 --> 22:08.415
They cast me out. Not quite the same.

22:08.440 --> 22:09.929
If memory serves, they cast you out

22:09.930 --> 22:11.627
after you assaulted a
member of the faculty.

22:11.652 --> 22:13.919
You weren't there. You did
not hear what he said to me.

22:13.944 --> 22:15.127
Ah!

22:15.206 --> 22:16.397
There's that rage.

22:16.961 --> 22:18.942
You really must keep
that in check, doctor.

22:18.967 --> 22:21.888
No one will take you seriously.

22:21.913 --> 22:24.916
Not even after you've inherited
your father's title.

22:32.762 --> 22:34.673
You think we're the same.

22:35.498 --> 22:36.680
Fellow outcasts.

22:39.355 --> 22:41.397
But if you could undergo
this treatment...

22:42.113 --> 22:43.833
if you could have every horrific moment

22:43.880 --> 22:44.891
struck from your memory...

22:45.721 --> 22:47.622
every time your work was denigrated

22:47.647 --> 22:48.849
and you were treated like filth.

22:50.337 --> 22:52.419
If for one moment you
could feel like a lamb,

22:53.443 --> 22:54.565
and not like a beast...

22:56.017 --> 22:57.098
wouldn't you do it?

22:59.110 --> 23:00.851
No.

23:01.892 --> 23:03.746
And that, my true friend,

23:03.771 --> 23:05.712
is the difference between you and me.

23:08.448 --> 23:11.837
I wonder, if this works... It will work.

23:11.862 --> 23:13.103
If it does...

23:13.174 --> 23:14.945
will you go through with it?

23:15.893 --> 23:18.004
Will you be able to bring
your Lily to this place?

23:18.139 --> 23:20.891
To insert the needle into her eye,

23:21.000 --> 23:23.032
and the horsebit into her mouth?

23:25.076 --> 23:27.108
Will you have the fortitude
to see this through?

23:37.833 --> 23:40.816
When Lily was as I created her...

23:42.793 --> 23:45.645
I was, for a few days of
my life, truly happy.

23:45.966 --> 23:47.808
It was perfect.

23:50.434 --> 23:52.073
She was perfect.

23:59.651 --> 24:01.582
What?

24:02.630 --> 24:04.606
Ocular
activity remains normal.

24:04.631 --> 24:05.741
Breathe, Mr. Balfour.

24:05.883 --> 24:08.754
Skin discoloration, no sign of...

24:08.904 --> 24:10.055
eczema.

24:12.133 --> 24:13.183
Who are you people?

24:13.277 --> 24:15.169
Do you not recognize us?

24:16.117 --> 24:17.198
No.

24:18.199 --> 24:19.544
Where am I?

24:19.569 --> 24:22.036
Royal Bedlam Hospital.
You're a patient here.

24:22.153 --> 24:23.387
Why?

24:23.412 --> 24:25.455
You threatened
to assassinate the Queen.

24:27.901 --> 24:28.941
No.

24:28.966 --> 24:30.878
That's not possible.

24:31.838 --> 24:33.145
I would never. I...

24:33.950 --> 24:35.184
I love Her Majesty.

24:35.186 --> 24:37.969
And I... I would never harm anyone.

24:38.467 --> 24:40.156
I can't even imagine wanting to. Please.

24:40.181 --> 24:42.063
You must believe me.

24:42.661 --> 24:44.489
Oh, I do, Mr. Balfour.

24:45.329 --> 24:47.261
I most certainly do.

24:58.980 --> 25:01.963
You still hoping to take
Ethan Talbot alive?

25:09.210 --> 25:12.253
Ethan Talbot is a
scourge upon the earth.

25:15.633 --> 25:17.645
Whatever code I have followed...

25:20.161 --> 25:22.113
I hereby disavow.

25:24.632 --> 25:28.576
If given the chance, I will
shoot him in the back.

25:30.211 --> 25:32.163
And butcher all his kind.

26:53.136 --> 26:55.019
And when this one dies?

26:55.051 --> 26:56.409
So will we.

28:55.476 --> 28:57.308
What do they mean?

29:00.151 --> 29:02.243
This is the story of the first Apache.

29:04.631 --> 29:06.553
Story goes...

29:07.832 --> 29:10.984
coyote opened a bag of darkness,

29:11.009 --> 29:12.981
and it spread across the Earth.

29:14.408 --> 29:17.321
The world was filled with
creatures of the night.

29:18.817 --> 29:20.809
Mankind was diseased,

29:21.512 --> 29:23.424
and devoured in the darkness.

29:24.425 --> 29:26.307
But then a boy was born.

29:28.188 --> 29:31.091
When he grew up, he faced
the creatures of the night

29:32.029 --> 29:33.210
and defeated them.

29:36.239 --> 29:38.181
And he won back the day.

29:45.486 --> 29:47.347
The boy's name was Apache.

29:47.348 --> 29:49.379
All Chiricahua are named after him.

29:52.443 --> 29:54.425
This is the story of how
the world was made.

29:55.506 --> 29:58.349
Or a prophecy of how it ends.

30:14.185 --> 30:16.087
Is there anything I can do?

30:17.897 --> 30:20.677
If I die, I die.

30:29.560 --> 30:32.453
If I do not survive this night,

30:33.142 --> 30:35.134
something you need to know.

30:36.371 --> 30:39.213
After my people were murdered

30:39.238 --> 30:41.300
or banished to the reservation...

30:42.169 --> 30:45.242
after my son abandoned me...

30:46.953 --> 30:48.895
I came to this land.

30:50.581 --> 30:52.463
My land.

30:54.407 --> 30:58.171
I wanted only to die.

31:01.121 --> 31:03.013
I was not allowed to.

31:04.225 --> 31:07.217
I received a vision.

31:07.242 --> 31:09.214
This vision...

31:10.286 --> 31:12.188
What did you see?

31:14.866 --> 31:18.648
I saw a world cast into darkness.

31:21.003 --> 31:23.065
<i>Streets were abandoned.</i>

31:26.617 --> 31:29.369
<i>I saw animals of the night.</i>

31:35.268 --> 31:38.162
<i>I saw my son.</i>

31:41.512 --> 31:45.376
Darkness will soon be upon us, Malcolm.

31:45.449 --> 31:48.382
If we lose Ethan to evil,

31:50.012 --> 31:52.650
the night will never end.

31:53.001 --> 31:55.610
And if it is a prophecy,

31:56.576 --> 31:58.437
what role do you play?

31:58.509 --> 32:00.181
Are you the savior?

32:00.329 --> 32:02.553
The warrior that ends the night?

32:04.017 --> 32:06.647
Or are you the wolf that loves it?

32:21.642 --> 32:24.475
We camped inside this cave for weeks.

32:28.954 --> 32:30.938
By then, I was one of the tribe.

32:33.306 --> 32:36.079
I had an Apache father
who taught me the ways.

32:37.668 --> 32:40.451
The army had hunted us to extinction.

32:41.406 --> 32:44.428
But I knew where we could
find food and guns.

32:44.782 --> 32:46.304
Your father's ranch.

32:46.345 --> 32:47.415
Heavily guarded, of course.

32:47.440 --> 32:49.322
But I knew where the guards would be.

32:49.710 --> 32:52.603
We could take what we
needed and steal away.

32:55.467 --> 32:57.389
Not a shot would be fired.

32:59.934 --> 33:02.553
That is what my Apache
father promised me.

33:06.457 --> 33:07.647
I annihilated a tribe.

33:07.648 --> 33:08.728
Yes.

33:08.729 --> 33:11.247
- I betrayed my family.
- Yes.

33:11.272 --> 33:13.887
I slaughtered women and children,

33:13.912 --> 33:15.943
and murdered my friend,

33:16.069 --> 33:18.060
and I will send my father to hell,

33:18.085 --> 33:19.496
and laugh while I do it.

33:19.740 --> 33:21.652
I'm done trying to be good.

33:36.421 --> 33:38.463
And when you end your father's life...

33:39.327 --> 33:40.700
whisper these words...

33:41.012 --> 33:44.986
"Lucifer, I am your animal."

33:46.101 --> 33:48.193
And you will never feel guilt again.

37:13.954 --> 37:17.079
What the fuck are you doing here?

37:18.711 --> 37:21.533
You never know where I'll turn up.

37:21.738 --> 37:22.789
Here.

37:23.178 --> 37:24.379
Take what's left.

37:36.205 --> 37:37.246
Go on. Finish it.

37:43.014 --> 37:44.844
Is she still alive?

37:44.845 --> 37:46.767
Uh-huh, barely.

38:00.600 --> 38:01.671
Pull the trigger

38:02.708 --> 38:04.630
and it'll be the last thing you do.

38:09.826 --> 38:11.350
Ethan.

38:12.194 --> 38:14.196
You shouldn't have come here, Malcolm.

38:47.802 --> 38:48.863
Whoa! Easy.

38:52.309 --> 38:54.279
The prodigal son has returned.

38:54.915 --> 38:57.828
Your daddy will be
real happy to see you.

39:15.346 --> 39:17.499
What do you want to do with this one?

39:18.657 --> 39:20.619
Up to you, Ethan.

39:26.095 --> 39:27.547
Let him die slow.

39:30.041 --> 39:32.843
He ain't worth the bullet.

39:35.066 --> 39:37.068
You can't leave him here.

39:37.945 --> 39:39.696
Ethan!

39:40.062 --> 39:41.863
Let him burn.

40:19.377 --> 40:20.994
I love you, my son.

40:22.369 --> 40:24.371
I'm so happy you're home.

41:03.284 --> 41:05.065
Sir Malcolm Murray.

41:08.319 --> 41:10.551
It is Sir Malcolm Murray, is it not?

41:10.834 --> 41:13.746
I pay those Pinkerton boys
an awful mess of money.

41:13.771 --> 41:15.792
I'd hate to think I've been misinformed.

41:15.817 --> 41:17.708
I'm Malcolm Murray.

41:17.733 --> 41:18.973
Jared Talbot. Mmm.

41:18.998 --> 41:22.503
You are very welcome in my home.

41:22.528 --> 41:24.180
Thank you for the change of clothes.

41:26.913 --> 41:27.964
Oh.

41:29.472 --> 41:31.503
It's like looking in a mirror.

41:31.860 --> 41:35.127
Here, this is from a
distillery in Tennessee.

41:35.152 --> 41:37.984
Fella by the name of
William LaRue Weller.

41:38.009 --> 41:39.199
You see, Billy,

41:39.200 --> 41:42.242
he puts wheat in the
mash instead of rye.

41:42.243 --> 41:45.075
Everyone called him a
madman for doing it.

41:45.100 --> 41:47.512
Now he makes millions, he's a mogul.

41:47.537 --> 41:49.539
So it goes for all of us.

41:51.489 --> 41:53.611
To building a better tomorrow.

42:00.502 --> 42:02.643
I'll send you home with a case.

42:03.028 --> 42:05.950
You'll never touch that
Scottish nonsense again.

42:05.975 --> 42:08.076
The woman who arrived
here with your son...

42:08.101 --> 42:12.124
Yes, it's been nice to have
a lady in the house again.

42:12.149 --> 42:13.674
It's been some time.

42:13.699 --> 42:14.910
I'd like to see her.

42:17.009 --> 42:18.029
Would you now?

42:18.054 --> 42:20.055
It's a matter of some urgency.

42:20.111 --> 42:21.659
She's resting.

42:21.684 --> 42:23.696
- Your son then?
- Resting.

42:25.166 --> 42:26.236
Mr. Talbot...

42:26.237 --> 42:29.110
I think I'll lead the conversation,
if that's all right.

42:30.281 --> 42:31.737
For instance,

42:31.762 --> 42:34.013
I'd like to know why
my son's been living

42:34.038 --> 42:36.910
in your mansion for the past year.

42:37.138 --> 42:39.239
My daughter went missing.

42:39.240 --> 42:43.104
I enlisted your son's services
in an effort to find her.

42:43.528 --> 42:45.917
- His services?
- As a hired gun.

42:45.942 --> 42:47.854
And did you find your daughter?

42:48.617 --> 42:49.798
My daughter died.

42:51.302 --> 42:53.264
I was unable to save her.

42:55.206 --> 42:58.612
Then you have...

42:59.099 --> 43:01.932
my heartfelt sympathy.

43:02.741 --> 43:04.873
That is a pain no father should know.

43:06.717 --> 43:09.448
May the Lord have mercy on their souls.

43:34.113 --> 43:36.114
This is by Audubon.

43:36.139 --> 43:39.131
Some folks think he only did birds,

43:39.156 --> 43:41.137
but no such thing.

43:41.162 --> 43:44.154
He did the bloodthirsty beasts as well.

43:44.179 --> 43:45.534
It fits here.

43:45.559 --> 43:48.096
This is a bloodthirsty land.

43:48.946 --> 43:51.758
When I first came to this place,

43:51.783 --> 43:53.834
it was infested with
those red-handed devils,

43:53.859 --> 43:55.292
the Apache.

43:55.482 --> 43:57.120
More animal than human...

43:57.258 --> 43:59.360
Not human at all, in truth.

44:00.698 --> 44:02.680
I blazed my way through the darkness.

44:03.362 --> 44:05.343
Through iron will and violent force,

44:05.368 --> 44:09.151
and the glory of God are empires born.

44:11.280 --> 44:13.301
There are mountains named after me.

44:13.326 --> 44:15.208
And at what cost?

44:16.527 --> 44:18.526
Your home's empty.

44:19.261 --> 44:21.183
Your son hates you.

44:23.892 --> 44:25.993
Your vainglorious pursuits
have led to nothing

44:26.018 --> 44:27.939
but bloodshed and heartache.

44:27.964 --> 44:30.076
But you're right, the
whiskey is very fine.

44:31.951 --> 44:34.723
Now what do you want from me?

44:34.748 --> 44:37.850
I want to know why you were
riding with that Apache filth.

44:38.132 --> 44:41.295
I was riding alongside a man.

44:42.808 --> 44:44.719
Tell me, Malcolm.

44:44.744 --> 44:46.765
When you were in Africa,

44:46.790 --> 44:50.003
how many of these "men"
did you slaughter?

44:53.239 --> 44:55.281
It is like looking in a mirror.

44:56.769 --> 44:59.415
- We are not the same.
- You're right...

44:59.440 --> 45:03.164
I still have one child to save.

45:04.003 --> 45:07.125
"Bring the fattened calf and kill it."

45:07.408 --> 45:11.362
"For this son of mine was
lost and now is found."

45:12.306 --> 45:15.178
Ethan will live out his
days on this land.

45:15.203 --> 45:17.115
And you will help me in this.

45:20.643 --> 45:23.440
And if I am unable to assist you?

45:25.917 --> 45:27.828
What would you do to
someone who came between

45:27.853 --> 45:29.865
you and your child?

45:44.325 --> 45:45.446
You're okay?

45:46.231 --> 45:47.352
Thanks to you.

45:55.384 --> 45:57.285
You saved my life.

45:57.310 --> 45:59.775
You'd have done the same for me.

45:59.800 --> 46:00.970
And shall.

46:01.143 --> 46:03.005
Again and again.

46:05.529 --> 46:07.471
You know what needs to be done.

46:08.369 --> 46:10.311
You don't have to remind me.

46:10.997 --> 46:13.069
This reckoning is a long time coming.

46:14.845 --> 46:16.209
I intend to enjoy it.

46:44.906 --> 46:46.334
Rance, you can leave us now.

46:46.359 --> 46:47.591
Sir... Oh, hell.

46:47.616 --> 46:50.146
My baby boy's not gonna hurt me.

46:57.784 --> 46:59.832
I don't blame you for hating me.

47:00.339 --> 47:02.231
I have given you cause.

47:02.967 --> 47:05.434
But try as I have, I can't
forgive you, either.

47:06.653 --> 47:08.645
We're not here to make amends.

47:09.161 --> 47:10.993
Why, then?

47:11.977 --> 47:14.079
To save your soul.

47:15.157 --> 47:18.189
You slaughter a train
full of innocent people,

47:18.214 --> 47:20.125
and you talk of redemption?

47:20.360 --> 47:21.460
Oh, not for me.

47:23.152 --> 47:25.224
I'll writhe in the fires of hell.

47:26.358 --> 47:28.230
But see...

47:28.542 --> 47:32.332
you say that word, "innocent."

47:33.386 --> 47:35.318
I don't know what it means.

47:36.505 --> 47:38.507
My son was on that train.

47:39.490 --> 47:41.402
There were people in the way.

47:41.612 --> 47:43.404
Were they innocent?

47:44.505 --> 47:46.346
And when I look you in the eye

47:46.347 --> 47:47.568
and ask you if your sister...

47:51.512 --> 47:55.386
Your precious little sister...

47:56.898 --> 47:58.099
was she innocent?

48:01.360 --> 48:04.223
And I read the guilt upon your face,

48:04.873 --> 48:08.535
for which you must atone.

48:10.077 --> 48:12.009
I've no intention of repenting.

48:12.253 --> 48:13.583
That's because you weren't there

48:13.623 --> 48:15.465
to witness what happened.

48:16.086 --> 48:18.197
Where were you, Ethan,

48:18.284 --> 48:21.057
when your Apaches attacked?

48:21.418 --> 48:25.322
I was in your stable,
stealing your horses.

48:27.580 --> 48:29.452
Rest assured...

48:31.051 --> 48:33.172
I've kept everything

48:33.478 --> 48:35.420
exactly as they left it.

48:39.650 --> 48:42.633
Time you see what it is you did, son.

48:51.229 --> 48:54.112
We were having supper
when they attacked...

48:56.068 --> 48:58.240
Your Apache friends.

48:59.464 --> 49:02.517
Your brother, Paul, was
leading us in the Grace.

49:04.143 --> 49:06.165
You remember your older brother, Paul...

49:07.363 --> 49:09.305
who shielded you from my lash?

49:10.024 --> 49:11.447
He was whispering

49:11.472 --> 49:12.996
the Lord's Prayer when they struck.

49:13.021 --> 49:14.418
Ten of my men...

49:14.625 --> 49:16.596
wiped out in an instant.

49:17.857 --> 49:18.938
It was as if

49:20.440 --> 49:24.364
they knew exactly where the
men would be stationed.

49:25.302 --> 49:27.363
Your brother, Paul,

49:27.388 --> 49:29.289
like the good shepherd,

49:29.314 --> 49:31.934
guided your mother and your sister

49:31.959 --> 49:33.229
into the chapel.

49:33.637 --> 49:36.639
While me and the few men I had left

49:36.664 --> 49:39.566
went after our store of ammunition.

49:39.591 --> 49:41.643
But that, too, had been ransacked.

49:42.637 --> 49:44.429
Somehow...

49:46.039 --> 49:48.951
they knew exactly where to look.

49:49.233 --> 49:51.454
They were supposed to take the weapons.

49:51.541 --> 49:53.423
That's all.

49:56.288 --> 49:58.160
In the end,

49:59.274 --> 50:02.035
we barricaded ourselves here.

50:03.121 --> 50:07.113
Your mother knelt here.

50:10.349 --> 50:13.322
She held your precious
little sister's hand.

50:15.001 --> 50:17.033
She prayed to God for mercy.

50:18.605 --> 50:20.397
Your mother.

50:21.072 --> 50:24.832
She prayed as they broke down the doors,

50:25.394 --> 50:26.972
as they shot through my men,

50:27.562 --> 50:29.657
as they pinned me to the ground,

50:29.682 --> 50:31.634
turned my face and made me watch.

50:33.089 --> 50:36.081
As they thrust their lances
through your brother Paul's

50:36.106 --> 50:38.082
body again and again

50:38.107 --> 50:40.135
until he was unrecognizable.

50:42.463 --> 50:44.455
A bloodied lump of flesh.

50:45.277 --> 50:47.299
Your mother watched this happen.

50:49.202 --> 50:51.154
Her first-born son.

50:52.550 --> 50:55.333
She tried to shield your sister.

50:56.294 --> 50:57.753
Held the precious girl so tight

50:57.879 --> 51:00.902
that it took three of
them to pull them apart.

51:04.458 --> 51:06.630
They scalped your mother as I watched.

51:09.463 --> 51:12.575
At least she didn't live
to see what happened next.

51:12.623 --> 51:15.199
They forced me to my knees.

51:15.224 --> 51:17.146
Pinned my arms behind my back.

51:18.199 --> 51:20.220
Held my eyes open,

51:20.337 --> 51:22.269
stood little Mary in front of me.

51:23.678 --> 51:26.431
She begged me to save her, to help her.

51:26.845 --> 51:27.936
And then,

51:29.266 --> 51:32.279
he forced her mouth open with his hand.

51:33.475 --> 51:36.298
Pressed his blade into her tongue.

51:37.212 --> 51:39.174
Her mouth filled with blood.

51:40.978 --> 51:43.059
I prayed to God to let her die,

51:43.271 --> 51:44.322
but she did not.

51:46.517 --> 51:48.329
She suffered...

51:48.492 --> 51:51.355
as the saints were made to suffer.

51:52.716 --> 51:56.652
Then, he cut out her eyes.

51:57.851 --> 52:01.864
So that she would
wander, blind and mute,

52:02.061 --> 52:04.043
in this place of death.

52:05.299 --> 52:07.351
That's what he said...

52:08.839 --> 52:10.771
your Apache.

52:11.569 --> 52:13.671
You brought the devil to my door, son.

52:15.455 --> 52:17.367
And you gave him the key.

52:18.436 --> 52:22.390
Now, you must get down on your knees

52:23.431 --> 52:27.160
and beg the mercy of our Lord.

52:28.569 --> 52:31.421
You will weep for what you have done.

52:31.594 --> 52:32.775
You will repent.

52:34.551 --> 52:37.454
Or I will send you to hell myself.

52:40.851 --> 52:43.624
I'm done repenting.

52:44.682 --> 52:46.624
And I belong in hell.
