WEBVTT

00:02.080 --> 00:03.514
DODD: Erstwhile on Fargo...

00:03.600 --> 00:05.557
FLOYD: We need to find Rye,
bring him home.

00:05.640 --> 00:06.755
HANZEE: Yes, ma'am.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.114
He known to you?

00:08.200 --> 00:10.032
Ed? Yeah.
He's a butcher.

00:10.560 --> 00:12.790
I ran over him!
Hit and run!

00:12.880 --> 00:16.430
LOU: His name was Rye Gerhardt
and his family hurts people for money.

00:16.880 --> 00:19.918
If you did something, you
made a mistake, you panicked,

00:20.040 --> 00:23.112
maybe covered it up,
now's the time to say.

00:23.600 --> 00:27.116
But that window's closing
and you may already be dead.

00:27.440 --> 00:28.839
We're asking you to leave.

00:29.160 --> 00:32.595
Management says acquire
the territory, we acquire it.

00:33.040 --> 00:35.839
Whether that's cash down or
sending bodies to the morgue,

00:35.920 --> 00:37.638
that's up to the krauts.

00:39.440 --> 00:41.033
Joe Bulo says hi.

00:41.120 --> 00:42.633
JOE: Your counter
has been rejected.

00:42.760 --> 00:44.637
And now we're lowering
our price by two million.

00:44.840 --> 00:47.514
Anything other than
unconditional surrender

00:47.600 --> 00:51.195
and we'll wipe every last
Gerhardt off the face of the earth.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.631
RONALD: My father
was a salesman.

01:17.320 --> 01:18.833
Ladies' shoes.

01:21.280 --> 01:24.989
It's fair to say, during the
Depression, that he struggled.

01:25.320 --> 01:28.312
<i>Like a lot of people on the
Rock River, in Dixon, lllinois.</i>

01:32.680 --> 01:35.559
But I've never been one
to focus on life's downs.

01:37.520 --> 01:39.591
! was a lifeguard
in high school.

01:39.680 --> 01:42.354
And where some saw a
drowning man, I saw a life to save.

01:45.920 --> 01:49.276
Which I did 77 times
in five years.

01:49.760 --> 01:51.194
(APPLAUSE)

01:54.360 --> 01:56.431
They put up a plaque
after I became governor.

01:58.240 --> 02:02.279
Well, I'd have to say I'm prouder
of that than just about anything.

02:02.360 --> 02:03.873
(APPLAUSE)

02:13.840 --> 02:16.116
I'm gonna call you Chief
Wigwam, you bring that thing.

02:16.240 --> 02:18.038
Any man can fire a gun.

02:18.960 --> 02:20.871
The longbow is an art.

02:47.880 --> 02:49.075
Everythin' okay?

02:49.160 --> 02:51.231
Just a little housekeeping.

02:51.480 --> 02:53.198
Let's kill
ourselves some deer.

02:53.280 --> 02:56.796
RONALD: My friends, we
have in our lifetime fought harder,

02:56.880 --> 02:58.314
paid a higher price
for freedom,

02:58.400 --> 03:00.596
and done more to advance
the dignity of man

03:00.680 --> 03:03.433
than any people who
ever lived on this earth.

03:08.320 --> 03:13.269
But if you look around, you may
not see many signs of that dignity.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.514
Crime is up,
Jobs are scarce.

03:16.600 --> 03:19.194
You have to stand in a line
Just to fill up your car.

03:41.360 --> 03:42.395
How?

03:42.480 --> 03:46.474
He was run down in the street,
then finished off at a second location.

03:49.720 --> 03:51.074
You're sure?

03:55.960 --> 03:56.916
Who?

03:57.000 --> 03:58.149
Butcher.

03:59.160 --> 04:00.116
A butcher?

04:00.200 --> 04:01.520
Down in Luverne.

04:01.720 --> 04:05.509
Like the law said, Rye followed
the judge, shot up the place.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.479
Got killed after.

04:07.600 --> 04:08.749
FLOYD: By a butcher?

04:08.840 --> 04:10.353
That's his name.

04:10.760 --> 04:12.080
Butcher of Luverne.

04:12.760 --> 04:14.512
That's what they call him.

04:14.680 --> 04:16.990
He's a contract man out of...

04:17.680 --> 04:19.398
Out of Kansas City.

04:20.680 --> 04:22.239
I wanna hear it from him.

04:28.080 --> 04:29.309
Kid was marked.

04:29.400 --> 04:30.879
Probably the day he left.

04:31.360 --> 04:33.476
Butcher ambushed
him after the judge.

04:33.800 --> 04:35.632
Tried to grab him, probably.

04:35.720 --> 04:37.472
He got in some licks.

04:37.680 --> 04:39.114
Things went downhill.

04:39.200 --> 04:40.190
Why?

04:40.280 --> 04:42.396
Ma, it's war. You said
yourself. They're jackals.

04:42.480 --> 04:45.074
Came here talkin'
about a settlement.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.436
Meanwhile the kid
is already dead.

04:47.760 --> 04:49.273
I'm askin' him.

04:53.560 --> 04:55.756
He's a bargaining
chip, yeah? Rye?

04:56.040 --> 04:57.314
Kansas City thinks
if they grab him up,

04:57.440 --> 04:58.714
then come to you
with that leverage,

04:58.800 --> 05:00.234
you'll sell for sure.

05:00.360 --> 05:02.920
Instead, they Kill him,
then panic, cover it up,

05:03.000 --> 05:06.391
knowin' once you find out,
sale's dead, no question.

05:17.360 --> 05:18.475
See?

05:18.760 --> 05:21.513
RONALD: The citizens of this
great nation want leadership, yes,

05:21.880 --> 05:25.714
but not a man on a white horse
demanding obedience to his commands.

05:26.240 --> 05:31.076
They want someone who believes
they can begin the world over again.

05:33.240 --> 05:36.312
I'm sayin' the age of the
local mom and pop is over.

05:36.440 --> 05:38.272
And what comes next,
Commissioner,

05:38.400 --> 05:42.792
the era of big business is gonna
make a lot of people very rich.

05:42.880 --> 05:44.200
I like the sound of that.

05:44.320 --> 05:48.598
And you're sayin' you can deliver
leaders on the state and local level?

05:49.160 --> 05:51.197
(CHUCKLES) Joe, there's not
a politician in this state

05:51.280 --> 05:52.839
wouldn't take my call
in the middle of dinner.

05:53.280 --> 05:56.875
Well, then you and me,
we're really gonna be pals.

05:57.600 --> 05:58.590
(BIRD SQUAWKING)

06:01.200 --> 06:03.669
A leader who will unleash
their great strength

06:03.800 --> 06:06.599
and remove the roadblocks
government has put in their way.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.279
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

06:09.520 --> 06:11.158
Watch and learn, Joe.

06:11.800 --> 06:15.270
I believe this nation
hungers for a spiritual revival.

06:15.560 --> 06:17.790
Watch and learn.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.476

06:37.920 --> 06:42.391
That we, all of us, hunger
to once again see honor

06:42.480 --> 06:44.596
placed above
political expediency.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.311
To see government, once again
the protector of liberties,

06:49.400 --> 06:52.472
not the distributor
of gifts and privilege.

06:53.480 --> 06:56.677
Government should uphold and
not undermine those institutions

06:57.840 --> 06:59.956
which are custodians
of the very values

07:00.080 --> 07:02.151
upon which civilization
is founded,

07:02.440 --> 07:07.594
religion, education,
and above all, family.

07:47.160 --> 07:49.754
RONALD: We who are
privileged to be Americans

07:50.760 --> 07:54.640
have had a rendezvous with
destiny since the moment in 1630

07:54.720 --> 07:57.792
when John Winthrop, standing
on the deck of the tiny Arbella

07:57.880 --> 07:59.553
<i>off the coast
of Massachusetts,</i>

07:59.640 --> 08:01.631
told that little
band of pilgrims,

08:01.720 --> 08:05.076
"We shall be as
a city upon a hill."

08:06.560 --> 08:09.916
A troubled and afflicted
mankind looks to us,

08:11.240 --> 08:14.551
pleading for us to keep
our rendezvous with destiny,

08:15.320 --> 08:18.995
that we will uphold the
principles of self-reliance,

08:19.080 --> 08:21.833
self-discipline, morality,

08:21.920 --> 08:25.834
and above all, responsible
liberty for every individual.

08:29.440 --> 08:33.751
That we will become that
shining city on a hill.

08:35.480 --> 08:38.393
My friends, I believe
that you and I together

08:38.760 --> 08:41.592
can keep this
rendezvous with destiny.

08:43.280 --> 08:44.554
Thank you.

08:46.480 --> 08:48.118
Thank you very much.

08:49.960 --> 08:50.916
Everyone, thank you.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.115
God bless you.

08:57.200 --> 08:58.679
(CHEERING)

09:01.640 --> 09:04.712
KARL: Son of a bitch is
charismatic, I'll give him that.

09:05.160 --> 09:06.912
But I'm not shakin' his hand.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.070
Why not, Karl?

09:08.160 --> 09:10.993
Because, Sonny, the man
made a movie with a monkey.

09:11.080 --> 09:12.991
It wouldn't be dignified.

09:13.080 --> 09:14.479
Well, hello.
How are you?

09:14.760 --> 09:16.876
I loved you in
Cattle Queen of Montana.

09:16.960 --> 09:18.792
Well, thank you. Not
many people liked that film.

09:18.880 --> 09:20.518
(CHUCKLES)
Hello, little girl.

09:20.600 --> 09:22.477
Governor, I'll be escorting
your bus to the next stop.

09:22.560 --> 09:23.675
So, whenever you're ready.

09:23.760 --> 09:24.989
Well, all right.

09:25.080 --> 09:26.150
You got drafted?

09:26.240 --> 09:27.719
Yeah, Captain called.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.552
I offered we had
murders to solve, but...

09:29.640 --> 09:31.677
He knows best, probably.

09:31.800 --> 09:33.199
Said he did anyway.

09:33.280 --> 09:35.999
Anyway, just got to take this
as far as the state line.

09:36.080 --> 09:37.832
So, be home by dark.
Okay.

09:37.920 --> 09:38.990
Bye.

09:39.200 --> 09:40.429
Bye.

09:40.520 --> 09:44.718
If you get the chance, ask him if it's
true that Joan Crawford had crabs.

09:45.760 --> 09:47.751
Yeah, I'm not
gonna do that.

10:05.040 --> 10:08.078
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

10:08.320 --> 10:10.357
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

10:12.960 --> 10:14.314
We got 'em.

10:15.880 --> 10:17.029
Bulo too?

10:17.120 --> 10:18.235
Oh, yeah.

10:19.120 --> 10:20.190
Milligan?

10:20.680 --> 10:22.398
No, he wasn't there.

10:23.760 --> 10:26.320
You can bet they're gonna
come back at us hard. (LAUGHS)

10:27.760 --> 10:29.558
I thought they'd negotiate.

10:33.640 --> 10:35.870
That's the feminine side, Mom.

10:36.200 --> 10:39.875
It was always gonna be war,
them knowing Rye was dead.

10:40.680 --> 10:42.114
Killin' him, I mean.

10:45.800 --> 10:47.791
I want this Butcher dead.

10:48.320 --> 10:49.674
In Luverne.

10:50.920 --> 10:52.240
No mercy.

10:59.880 --> 11:01.553
I'm sending Virgil.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.274
(GRUNTING)

11:37.160 --> 11:38.230
Hon.

11:39.360 --> 11:40.430
Hon?

11:42.320 --> 11:44.436
Sorry, are we out of coffee?

11:46.120 --> 11:48.316
What?

11:49.440 --> 11:50.794
Did you...

11:52.840 --> 11:53.955
You weren't in bed, so I...

11:54.040 --> 11:55.872
I know, I was
just thinkin'...

11:55.960 --> 11:56.950
What?

11:57.040 --> 11:59.316
What we should take.

11:59.680 --> 12:01.034
Take where?

12:02.880 --> 12:04.279
When we go?

12:05.840 --> 12:07.592
Where are we goin'?

12:08.560 --> 12:10.073
To California.

12:12.240 --> 12:13.719
What are you...

12:13.800 --> 12:16.235
What are you talkin'...
When we run, I mean.

12:16.320 --> 12:18.231
Ya heard what Lou said.

12:19.160 --> 12:21.071
I mean, if we've
just messed things...

12:21.160 --> 12:23.913
If I've just messed
things up from the start?

12:24.680 --> 12:26.751
If this is
still not over?

12:27.120 --> 12:29.191
Just the tail
of the snake.

12:30.160 --> 12:31.992
What are you sayin'?

12:32.560 --> 12:36.394
I mean, what was he even doin' in
the road, for shit sake? That fella.

12:36.480 --> 12:40.189
All those dead people,
and he had a car,

12:40.320 --> 12:42.834
SO why was he
standin' in the road?

12:42.920 --> 12:44.433
I don't know.

12:47.360 --> 12:48.316
But...

12:48.400 --> 12:49.879
Constance saw.

12:52.040 --> 12:53.314
Saw what?

12:54.320 --> 12:55.640
The car...

12:56.880 --> 13:00.271
After you cleaned it, but
before we crashed it again.

13:02.040 --> 13:04.316
She knows about
the accident.

13:07.920 --> 13:11.231
She drove me home
the night I...

13:12.680 --> 13:15.513
(SIGHS) The night
you got rid of the...

13:16.200 --> 13:18.669
And had to use the bathroom.

13:19.640 --> 13:22.439
I was gonna
walk her right out,

13:22.520 --> 13:26.195
but then I heard music
comin' from the garage...

13:26.720 --> 13:28.996
And she came up
behind me and saw.

13:29.120 --> 13:31.634
I mean, what did
she say, though?

13:33.920 --> 13:34.990
I...

13:35.960 --> 13:39.874
I don't think she'll tell, but how
can we know for sure, you know?

13:40.000 --> 13:44.073
And plus now with the law
enforcement askin' questions, suspectin'.

13:44.160 --> 13:46.515
And these ghouls on
the come, Lou said.

13:47.080 --> 13:49.037
Hon, we can't stay here.

13:49.640 --> 13:50.630
No.

13:51.280 --> 13:52.270
Hon.

13:52.360 --> 13:53.395
No.

13:54.080 --> 13:56.515
You said... We agreed.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.750
Clean it up and
everything'd be...

13:58.840 --> 13:59.830
I know, hon...

13:59.920 --> 14:00.910
No.

14:01.200 --> 14:04.192
We did this for
a reason, Peg.

14:04.360 --> 14:05.839
For the shop and the kids.

14:05.920 --> 14:08.799
For a reason, so we could
stay. That's the only... That's...

14:08.880 --> 14:10.791
Hon, you got
to be realistic.

14:10.880 --> 14:11.836
No. No!

14:11.920 --> 14:13.593
I... We're stayin'.

14:14.760 --> 14:16.080
That was...

14:17.640 --> 14:21.952
Whatever comes, we'll deal
with it, or it'll deal with us.

14:22.520 --> 14:25.319
But I'm buyin' the shop
and we're startin' a family.

14:26.800 --> 14:27.790
But how?

14:27.880 --> 14:30.156
It's too late to get the
money back for the course.

14:30.280 --> 14:32.635
And you said Bud had
to have it by Friday.

14:32.720 --> 14:35.280
We'll figure it out.
That's what people do.

14:35.720 --> 14:38.678

Just now?

32:21.200 --> 32:22.520
Moments ago.

32:24.360 --> 32:27.512
Well, I couldn't give you
any more than $700 for her.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.070
Okay.

32:31.480 --> 32:34.120
Are you sure?
It's worth at least 14.

32:34.200 --> 32:37.909
Yeah, well, seven today
is better than 14 tomorrow.

32:39.360 --> 32:42.637
So can we do it now,
like, right away?

32:49.040 --> 32:52.670
MAN: (SINGING) Wash away
my troubles Wash away my pain

32:52.920 --> 32:55.878
With the rain in Shambala

32:56.720 --> 33:00.315
Wash away my sorrow
Wash away my shame

33:00.560 --> 33:03.552
With the rain in Shambala

33:04.400 --> 33:08.155
Ooh, yeah

33:08.640 --> 33:11.234
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

33:12.000 --> 33:15.994
Ooh, yeah

33:35.880 --> 33:37.439
(TURNS OFF FAUCET)

33:46.680 --> 33:48.193
How'd it go this mornin'?

33:50.320 --> 33:52.311
Killed a few,
lost a few.

33:54.040 --> 33:56.270
But you delivered
the message.

34:02.240 --> 34:05.392
I want to thank you for
your service to this family.

34:05.520 --> 34:06.874
Me and Mom.

34:09.120 --> 34:12.397
Ever since my dad took
you in, eight, nine years old,

34:12.480 --> 34:14.630
you never complained
or made demands.

34:16.520 --> 34:19.638
Though it might not feel
like it all the time, to me,

34:20.719 --> 34:22.677
you're part of this family.

34:23.159 --> 34:25.275
Not that Dodd would
ever tell you that,

34:27.159 --> 34:31.154
which I know you're mostly his
guy, but I just want you to know,

34:31.239 --> 34:33.550
there's a place for you at
our table, with or without him.

34:33.960 --> 34:35.837
All you gotta do is
be straight with us.

34:35.920 --> 34:37.399
I am straight.

34:39.679 --> 34:41.830
Well, of course. It's just...

34:42.040 --> 34:45.998
We just escalated this war
on account of what you...

34:47.320 --> 34:49.516
The information you
found out about Rye.

34:51.120 --> 34:52.599
Mom's real upset,

34:52.679 --> 34:55.797
but I have to just
double-check the veracity of...

34:57.520 --> 34:59.113
Before it's too far
over the breach.

34:59.240 --> 35:00.469
(DOOR OPENING)

35:01.480 --> 35:03.153
DODD: My daughter back?

35:06.120 --> 35:08.157
What the hell
are you doin'?

35:08.280 --> 35:09.918
Get back to work.

35:11.200 --> 35:12.679
That's my man.

35:13.080 --> 35:16.072
You need to talk to him,
you talk to me first.

35:16.880 --> 35:20.760
Last time I checked, everyone
here worked for one person. Ma.

35:21.120 --> 35:22.793
You actually like it, huh?

35:22.880 --> 35:24.996
Takin' orders from a woman.

35:26.280 --> 35:28.920
Is that how it was in the
bedroom with Kathy? (SCOFFS)

35:29.000 --> 35:30.115
Don't you talk about her.

35:30.200 --> 35:32.191
She strap one on,
bend you over the bed,

35:32.320 --> 35:34.277
and show you who's
boss? (LAUGHS)

35:38.320 --> 35:40.880
There'll be a reckoning
one day, brother.

35:41.880 --> 35:45.111
All souls are called to
account for their actions.

35:46.840 --> 35:50.549
In the end, we all
get what we deserve.

35:52.960 --> 35:55.236
You keep tellin'
yourself that.

35:57.960 --> 35:58.950
(WHISTLING)

35:59.400 --> 36:02.438
RONALD: The eyes of
all people are upon us

36:02.920 --> 36:07.790
so that if we shall deal falsely with
our God in this work we have undertaken

36:07.880 --> 36:10.599
and so cause Him to withdraw
his present help from us,

36:10.680 --> 36:14.435
we shall be made a story and
a byword throughout the world.

36:15.600 --> 36:18.877
A troubled and afflicted
mankind looks to us.

36:19.960 --> 36:21.997
My friends, I believe
that you and I together

36:22.080 --> 36:24.913
can keep this rendezvous
with destiny.

36:26.360 --> 36:27.680
Thank you.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.674
God bless you and
God bless America.

36:36.960 --> 36:37.950
Oh!

36:38.960 --> 36:40.359
Oh, that's good.

36:40.600 --> 36:42.830
Been holding it
since Ortonville.

36:43.040 --> 36:45.998
My wife puts this
potpourri in the bus toilet,

36:46.080 --> 36:47.957
can barely
breathe in there.

36:48.920 --> 36:50.957
They do like
their scents.

36:52.120 --> 36:53.315
Where'd you serve, son?

36:56.080 --> 36:59.038
Mekong Delta, swift
boat patrol. Two tours.

36:59.480 --> 37:01.915
Well, I sure
appreciate your service.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.230
Every generation
has their time.

37:05.240 --> 37:07.470
I remember back in '42,
America had just joined the war.

37:07.560 --> 37:11.519
I was working on Operation
Eagle's Nest for Paramount.

37:12.920 --> 37:14.274
I got dropped
behind enemy lines

37:14.360 --> 37:16.920
trying to rescue Jimmy
Whitmore and Laraine Day

37:17.000 --> 37:18.638
from this SS commando.

37:19.480 --> 37:22.040
Bob Stack was on
loan from Selznick.

37:22.800 --> 37:25.189
That Nazi bastard
had us cornered.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.149
We were done for,
but in the end,

37:27.320 --> 37:28.435
with a little
American ingenuity,

37:28.520 --> 37:30.158
we managed to...

37:31.600 --> 37:33.511
No, now wait
a minute. Um...

37:34.520 --> 37:38.434
Come to think of it, I don't
think we made it out of that one.

37:38.520 --> 37:39.840
Or did we?

37:40.680 --> 37:42.398
Oh, shit,
I can't remember.

37:42.480 --> 37:45.040
Well, either way,
it was a fine picture.

37:46.920 --> 37:47.910
Um...

37:56.440 --> 37:58.636
Governor, I
don't mean to...

37:59.600 --> 38:02.114
What we did over
there, the war...

38:02.640 --> 38:03.630
Um...

38:04.040 --> 38:07.078
And now, my wife's
got lymphoma.

38:08.120 --> 38:09.474
Stage Il

38:09.560 --> 38:11.995
And lately, the
state of things...

38:14.280 --> 38:17.193
Well, sometimes, I...
Late at night...

38:19.600 --> 38:23.116
I wonder if maybe the
sickness of this world,

38:23.200 --> 38:25.874
if itisn't inside
my wife somehow.

38:27.040 --> 38:28.474
The cancer.

38:30.160 --> 38:33.710
I don't know what
I'm sayin' except,

38:35.480 --> 38:38.120
do you really think we'll
get outta this mess we're in?

38:41.080 --> 38:42.912
Son, there's not a
challenge on God's earth

38:43.000 --> 38:45.310
that can't be overcome
by an American.

38:45.520 --> 38:47.318
I truly believe that.

38:48.760 --> 38:49.830
Yeah.

38:51.280 --> 38:52.395
But how?

39:04.920 --> 39:05.910
(DOOR CLOSES)

40:15.800 --> 40:17.677
Mommy.
Sorry.

40:17.760 --> 40:19.159
Poppa's here.

40:19.400 --> 40:20.595
Your dad is?

40:20.680 --> 40:21.715
No.

40:21.800 --> 40:23.199
No, just me.

40:23.840 --> 40:25.797
Saw Molly in the window.

40:25.880 --> 40:28.520
I knocked, you didn't hear?

40:29.000 --> 40:29.990
No.

40:30.680 --> 40:33.354
Well, got worried,
so I let myself in.

40:35.200 --> 40:36.429
You feelin' okay?

40:36.800 --> 40:37.790
Oh, sure.

40:41.400 --> 40:42.595
Little tired.

40:42.680 --> 40:43.909
Yeah, just talked to Lou,

40:44.000 --> 40:46.116
probably got another two hours
on this Reagan detail.

40:46.200 --> 40:50.080
So I thought, you know, I'd just
stop by and make a nuisance.

40:52.640 --> 40:54.233
Are you hungry?

40:54.320 --> 40:55.435
I can fix you somethin'.

40:55.520 --> 40:56.794
You're sweet.

40:56.880 --> 40:59.110
I was just now
tryin' to decide

40:59.240 --> 41:01.550
if I'm hungry or
if I wanna throw up.

41:03.080 --> 41:05.230
Don't normally
confuse the two.

41:05.320 --> 41:08.119
Well, nausea's a side effect
of this drug they gave me.

41:08.200 --> 41:10.794
Which would mean they actually
gave me the drug, and not candy.

41:11.320 --> 41:12.549
There's candy?

41:12.640 --> 41:14.039
Eat somethin' green
and we'll talk.

41:14.480 --> 41:17.836
HANK: So we're rootin'
for nausea, then, huh?

41:18.440 --> 41:20.511
Well, okay. Um...

41:25.400 --> 41:27.198
I'm just all left thumbs when
it comes to this stuff...

41:27.280 --> 41:28.554
You're doin' great. Dad.

41:28.640 --> 41:30.677
No, I don't know
about that.

41:31.240 --> 41:33.914
If your mom were here,
she'd know just what to say.

41:34.000 --> 41:34.990
Me?

41:35.920 --> 41:37.831
I can fix the toaster.
(CHUCKLES)

41:39.400 --> 41:41.152
Well, maybe just...

41:42.240 --> 41:45.551
Do you think maybe you
could watch Molly for a bit?

41:47.640 --> 41:48.789
I just don't...

41:48.880 --> 41:52.635
I'm not sure if I can keep my eyes
open right now, for some reason.

41:53.760 --> 41:54.875
Watch who?

41:54.960 --> 41:55.995
Me.

41:56.080 --> 41:57.070
Who?

41:59.840 --> 42:00.875

42:00.960 --> 42:02.837

You get some rest.

And I can see that now.

51:13.840 --> 51:15.558
Hon, we... So...

51:15.640 --> 51:16.835
Hon!
Ta-da!

51:18.360 --> 51:19.839
I sold the car.
What car?

51:19.920 --> 51:20.910
My car.

51:21.000 --> 51:24.914
I went to the shop and Sonny, you
know, he said how much he loved it,

51:25.000 --> 51:29.710
and so I... And I know that
I could've gotten more for it,

51:29.800 --> 51:31.632
but it's enough
is what matters.

51:31.720 --> 51:32.869
Enough to buy the shop.

51:33.480 --> 51:34.675
You, you...

51:34.760 --> 51:36.114
Because you were right.

51:36.200 --> 51:38.350
This was our dream, you know.

51:38.440 --> 51:41.319
And so now,
we can do it.

51:42.280 --> 51:44.032
The shop burned down.

51:45.360 --> 51:46.589
What?

51:46.680 --> 51:48.910
And I killed another
fella, maybe two.

51:49.040 --> 51:52.078
And Lou... Lou was
right. They came.

51:52.600 --> 51:54.637
They came. The other
fella that you hit, his family?

51:54.720 --> 51:56.074
They came.

51:56.360 --> 51:57.839
So, this is...

51:58.040 --> 52:00.270
That's great,
you know, thank you.

52:00.360 --> 52:02.112
But we gotta go.

52:02.200 --> 52:03.918
You need to pack.

52:04.000 --> 52:05.195
Okay, okay?

52:05.280 --> 52:06.873
Look at... Okay.

52:10.640 --> 52:12.199
