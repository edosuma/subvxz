WEBVTT

00:01.769 --> 00:04.837
Okay, Gloria, just make sure
Jay doesn't find out.

00:04.839 --> 00:06.705
Oh. Boy.

00:06.707 --> 00:08.173
I just heard that.

00:08.175 --> 00:09.608
You probably think
there's something

00:09.610 --> 00:10.676
Between me and Gloria.

00:10.678 --> 00:11.844
Relax.

00:11.846 --> 00:13.879
I couldn't be more relaxed
if I was in a coma.

00:13.881 --> 00:15.981
Jay's grill
was delivered.

00:15.983 --> 00:17.182
She's keeping it
under wraps

00:17.184 --> 00:18.617
So I can be there
when he sees it!

00:18.619 --> 00:19.618
Oh, my god!

00:19.620 --> 00:21.353
I just got accepted
into caltech.

00:21.355 --> 00:22.621
You did?!

00:22.623 --> 00:23.889
That is incredible!

00:23.891 --> 00:26.625
We're gonna have a famous
scientist in the family!

00:26.627 --> 00:29.294
Uh, not that there's any shame
in learning a trade.

00:29.296 --> 00:31.497
Air conditioners
are always gonna break.

00:31.499 --> 00:33.632
Eh, I looked into it.
It's a lot of classes.

00:33.634 --> 00:36.301
Honey,
that is unbelievable.

00:36.303 --> 00:37.870
It's hardly unbelievable.

00:37.872 --> 00:39.738
Super-smart kid,
super-smart school.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.040
I never doubted you.

00:41.042 --> 00:42.141
That must feel great.

00:42.143 --> 00:44.076
Yep. Pretty great.

00:45.745 --> 00:46.745
What was that?

00:46.747 --> 00:47.880
I think
that was my fault.

00:47.882 --> 00:49.214
Me too. Why?

00:49.216 --> 00:50.649
I do this all the time.

00:50.651 --> 00:52.818
She does these amazing things,
and I'm so used to it,

00:52.820 --> 00:54.820
I don't even make a big deal
over caltech.

00:54.822 --> 00:56.255
<i>I </i> got excited.
Doesn't that count?

00:56.257 --> 00:58.023
Well, honey,
you get excited over everything.

00:58.025 --> 00:59.558
You're a born cheerleader.

00:59.560 --> 01:02.327
I just need to make a really big
fuss over Alex today.

01:02.329 --> 01:03.162
That's all.

01:03.164 --> 01:04.430
I know... you're upset

01:04.432 --> 01:05.664
Because I said
that you were a born...

01:05.666 --> 01:07.332
There's no such thing
as a born cheerleader.

01:07.334 --> 01:08.667
It takes hard work
and sacrifice.

01:08.669 --> 01:10.903
You know what a human pyramid is
without hours of training?

01:10.905 --> 01:12.004
Mnh-mnh.

01:12.006 --> 01:13.272
10 obituaries.

01:13.274 --> 01:22.281
Captions by <b> <i>vitac</i> </b> ...

01:26.619 --> 01:28.353
Hey, I think my dad
is really gonna enjoy

01:28.355 --> 01:29.588
Returning his gift
this year.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.757
Mitchell,
I have some really sad news.

01:31.759 --> 01:33.425
Yes, you seem
very broken up.

01:33.427 --> 01:36.261
Apparently,
I had an uncle, uh, cyrus,

01:36.263 --> 01:39.932
Who died and out of the blue
left me a pretty handsome sum.

01:39.934 --> 01:41.800
I-I guess he didn't have
a lot of other kin.

01:41.802 --> 01:44.203
Okay, this is the one time
I don't mind you saying "kin."

01:44.205 --> 01:45.437
Now,
when you say "handsome,"

01:45.439 --> 01:47.539
Are we talking
carpool dad at Lily's school

01:47.541 --> 01:49.541
Or are we
in a more clooney/pitt area?

01:49.543 --> 01:51.643
Mm. I would say
more harry hamlin.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.078
Oh.
That's not bad at...

01:53.080 --> 01:54.913
that's not bad at all.

01:54.915 --> 01:56.982
You know, and this is crazy,
because, um, I just saw

01:56.984 --> 01:59.618
That the upstairs unit
went back on the market,

01:59.620 --> 02:02.121
And harry hamlin would almost
equal a down payment, and...

02:02.123 --> 02:03.722
I'm... I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.157
Look at me,
spending your money.

02:05.159 --> 02:07.493
No, Mitchell, it's not <i>my </i> money.
It's <i>our </i> money.

02:07.495 --> 02:09.294
I-is this a sign, Cam?

02:09.295 --> 02:11.730
I mean, we talk about it
all the time.

02:11.732 --> 02:13.799
We should buy
that upstairs apartment.

02:13.801 --> 02:16.001
I don't see a reason
why not!

02:16.003 --> 02:17.469
This is so exciting.

02:17.471 --> 02:18.337
I know.

02:18.339 --> 02:19.471
I'm really proud of you,

02:19.473 --> 02:20.772
Because there was a time

02:20.774 --> 02:23.108
When I wouldn't have
even <i>seen </i> this check.

02:23.110 --> 02:25.911
Oh, well, yes. You know, I used
to be quite the impulse buyer.

02:25.913 --> 02:28.413
But I don't even recognize
that guy anymore.

02:28.415 --> 02:30.449
I love my new faux mink,
daddy.

02:30.451 --> 02:32.751
I forgot...
Which gabor sister am I?

02:32.753 --> 02:34.353
Y-you're eva, the classy one,
but listen.

02:34.355 --> 02:36.455
We need to keep the tags on it,
because it's going back.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.157
Well, then yours
is going back, too.

02:38.159 --> 02:39.458
No,
that's a hard thing,

02:39.460 --> 02:42.327
Because the saleslady said
I look like Dr. Zhivago.

02:44.631 --> 02:46.265
So, is that
a birthday present for you

02:46.267 --> 02:48.267
Or an extremely late
mid-life crisis?

02:48.269 --> 02:50.702
I don't think
"extremely" is necessary.

02:50.704 --> 02:53.805
It's on loan... kind of
a weekend-long test-drive.

02:53.807 --> 02:55.307
Wow...
<i>I </i> walk into a store,

02:55.309 --> 02:57.709
They make me leave my backpack
behind the counter.

02:57.711 --> 02:59.511
It's an old
car salesman's trick.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.880
They're hoping I fall in love
with it and never give it back.

03:01.882 --> 03:03.615
But I can't justify
buying it

03:03.617 --> 03:06.185
Any more than you can
justify that hat.

03:06.187 --> 03:08.487
Little early for tequila,
isn't it?

03:08.489 --> 03:09.821
It's for Luke.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.623
Not sure that's better.
The last time he was here,

03:11.625 --> 03:13.859
He was eyeing this bottle
the same way you look at me

03:13.861 --> 03:15.894
When I wear
that strappy sundress.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.129
I do like that dress.

03:17.131 --> 03:18.664
I am going to
catch him red-handed.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.632
I am going to
teach him a lesson.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.668
But first I'm going to
refill this with water

03:22.670 --> 03:24.369
In case he gets past me.

03:24.371 --> 03:26.038
You know, we have a little time
before the family comes.

03:26.040 --> 03:27.539
Why don't you
throw that dress on and...

03:28.542 --> 03:29.575
Aw, damn it.

03:29.577 --> 03:30.876
Andy,
can you get that?

03:30.878 --> 03:31.977
Andy?

03:31.979 --> 03:33.011
Sorry.

03:33.013 --> 03:34.580
I tuned out
when you started flirting

03:34.582 --> 03:36.715
To give you some privacy.

03:38.352 --> 03:40.085
I was seeing Haley
for the first time

03:40.087 --> 03:42.054
Since she Came to visit me
in the hospital.

03:42.056 --> 03:44.089
She said
some pretty heavy stuff.

03:44.091 --> 03:46.525
If I'm your elephant,
you have a shot.

03:46.527 --> 03:48.427
That's what
I'm trying to say, dummy.

03:48.429 --> 03:50.362
She didn't know I heard.

03:50.364 --> 03:51.597
I tried for a couple weeks

03:51.599 --> 03:53.599
To forget about it
and just go on with beth,

03:53.601 --> 03:56.068
But I couldn't stop thinking
about Haley.

03:56.070 --> 04:00.772
So... Today's the day I'm
finally gonna have the big talk.

04:00.774 --> 04:04.243
There's a cooler of drinks
out back! Help yourselves!

04:04.245 --> 04:05.210
Hey.

04:05.212 --> 04:06.612
Where's Haley?
Is she coming?

04:06.614 --> 04:08.780
The last time Haley informed me
of her plans, she said,

04:08.782 --> 04:10.682
"ha ha. I'm going to cabo,
and you're not."

04:10.684 --> 04:12.351
she's the best.

04:13.453 --> 04:17.689
Get ready to see
the best gift ever.

04:17.690 --> 04:19.190
Happy birthday!

04:19.192 --> 04:21.293
It's a grill.
I <i>got </i> a grill.

04:21.295 --> 04:23.528
You had a wife, too. Didn't mean
you couldn't trade up.

04:23.530 --> 04:25.464
I give you
the flame xl.

04:25.466 --> 04:27.299
My client
owns the company.

04:27.301 --> 04:29.067
He gave me
a crazy-good deal.

04:29.069 --> 04:31.036
25,000 wood propane btus.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.237
That's... Plenty, right?

04:32.239 --> 04:35.073
No.
Electric rotisserie!

04:35.075 --> 04:38.610
If god wants a hamburger,
this is what she cooks it on.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.112
But it's got
all those doodads.

04:40.114 --> 04:42.114
I don't know what to do
with those doodads.

04:42.116 --> 04:43.215
You're doing a great job

04:43.217 --> 04:45.050
Of hiding your excitement
about this gift.

04:45.052 --> 04:46.451
Look.
It's simplicity itself.

04:46.453 --> 04:48.954
You just turn on the gas,
hit the electric starter.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.723
Hit the electric starter.

04:51.725 --> 04:52.991
Phil, you might want
to lay off...

04:52.993 --> 04:54.159
Aah!

04:54.161 --> 04:55.160
I'm fine.

04:55.162 --> 04:56.795
Healthy as ever.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.598
I'd know if you weren't,
'cause I just saw your skeleton.

04:59.600 --> 05:00.899
<i>Okay, Joe.</i>

05:00.901 --> 05:03.535
<i>Time for a nap in your new bed!</i>

05:06.739 --> 05:08.774
Looking for something?
Aah!

05:08.776 --> 05:10.475
Uh, yeah... you.

05:10.477 --> 05:13.145
I just wanted to say what
a nice party you put together.

05:13.147 --> 05:15.314
The secret is to know
what your guests want,

05:15.316 --> 05:17.015
And I know what you want.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.950
Hey, Luke,
quick lesson.

05:18.952 --> 05:21.320
This is a coaster.
It prevents rings.

05:21.322 --> 05:23.322
Thanks to you
and your dr pepper,

05:23.324 --> 05:26.158
My teak end table upstairs
looks like the olympic flag.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.426
Think, Luke.

05:27.428 --> 05:30.329
Yes. Think, Luke.

05:33.266 --> 05:34.299
Did you get it?

05:34.301 --> 05:35.600
Yep.

05:35.602 --> 05:37.269
Sweet Mexican treasure.

05:37.271 --> 05:39.438
I was born in Florida,
but thank you.

05:39.440 --> 05:41.106
So, you really think
you're gonna buy it?

05:41.108 --> 05:42.107
I mean,
it makes sense.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.675
We're kind of cramped
where we are.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.644
There she is...
Our little genius.

05:45.646 --> 05:47.112
She just got accepted
to caltech.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.347
Oh, that's amazing!
Mm-hmm.

05:48.349 --> 05:49.981
It's not
that big of a deal.

05:49.983 --> 05:51.149
It's a <i>huge </i> deal!

05:51.151 --> 05:53.185
That school pumps out
nobel prize winners

05:53.187 --> 05:55.287
The way <i>my </i> school
pumped out stomachs.

05:55.289 --> 05:57.656
Enough, mom!

05:57.658 --> 05:59.024
Uh...
What was that about?

06:00.461 --> 06:02.694
I didn't make a big enough fuss
about her getting into caltech,

06:02.696 --> 06:04.296
And now she's making me pay.

06:04.298 --> 06:06.064
Well, if that's her
giving you a hard time,

06:06.066 --> 06:07.499
I think you got off
pretty easy.

06:07.501 --> 06:08.700
Well, that's true.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.702
That one never really
went through a rebellious phase.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.804
Remember how wild <i>we </i> were?

06:12.806 --> 06:14.673
Ohh!

06:14.675 --> 06:16.007
Were we ever!

06:17.044 --> 06:18.577
Ohh.

06:18.579 --> 06:19.878
<i>Were </i> we ever?

06:19.880 --> 06:20.912
Not really, no.

06:20.914 --> 06:22.714
You had your summer
of the red afro,

06:22.716 --> 06:24.883
And I dated the whitest
puerto rican on earth.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.852
Oh, wayne. Yeah.
Yeah.

06:26.854 --> 06:28.653
Hey, but it's not like
we didn't separate

06:28.655 --> 06:29.888
And strike out
on our own.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.556
Yeah! That's right.
Am I right? Huh?

06:31.558 --> 06:32.691
Ahhhh.

06:32.693 --> 06:34.192
Dad bought me my house.

06:34.194 --> 06:35.327
Ours, too.

06:35.329 --> 06:36.561
He loaned us the money
for the down payment.

06:36.563 --> 06:37.863
We never paid him back.

06:37.865 --> 06:39.064
I've always felt so guilty.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.333
You know, he gave us
our down payment, too.

06:41.335 --> 06:43.068
Are you sure
that wasn't a gift?

06:43.070 --> 06:44.870
Well, I never offered
to pay him back. I don't know.

06:44.872 --> 06:46.438
And then he just gave me
this bonus at work.

06:46.440 --> 06:48.006
Oy. What he must
think of me.

06:48.008 --> 06:50.041
It's so long ago now.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.710
Well, still.

06:51.712 --> 06:54.012
I feel like I should offer
to pay him back.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.847
What... no. N-no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, Claire.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.516
Because then <i>I'm </i> gonna
have to pay him back,

06:57.518 --> 06:58.950
And I'll be stuck
in the same shoe box

06:58.952 --> 07:00.285
He bought me last time.

07:00.287 --> 07:01.887
Mitchell,
he's not going to accept it.

07:01.889 --> 07:03.355
It's just a gesture.

07:03.357 --> 07:05.757
We do it
so <i>we </i> feel more independent.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.192
Just do it.

07:07.194 --> 07:08.193
Do it!

07:08.195 --> 07:09.394
Do what?
Oh, nothing.

07:09.396 --> 07:10.729
You're busy.
Not really.

07:10.731 --> 07:12.364
Phil's tinkering
with the new grill,

07:12.366 --> 07:14.366
So you better collect
some old photographs
for the memorial.

07:14.368 --> 07:15.867
Oh.
Do what?

07:15.869 --> 07:17.135
Uh...

07:17.137 --> 07:19.638
Well, um, you probably
don't remember this.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.440
But, uh,
a while back,

07:21.442 --> 07:24.142
You gave us some money
for a down payment.

07:24.144 --> 07:26.711
Very generously,
I might add. Yes.

07:26.713 --> 07:29.114
And not just
'cause it's your birthday...
That's right.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.883
...But we wanted
to at least make the offer

07:31.885 --> 07:35.554
To pay... You... Back.

07:35.556 --> 07:37.489
Mitchell, what are you doing?
I can't cash this.

07:37.491 --> 07:39.157
Now, dad, I...

07:39.159 --> 07:40.792
You got to sign it
first.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.294
Okay, uh, in that case,

07:42.296 --> 07:43.895
I'm gonna need
to get the pen back from...

07:43.897 --> 07:44.796
Claire!

07:44.798 --> 07:46.064
Got one right here.
Oh. Okay.

07:49.135 --> 07:50.335
Hey, you.

07:50.337 --> 07:51.937
Oh. Hey.

07:51.939 --> 07:53.738
I didn't expect
to see you here today.

07:53.740 --> 07:54.973
How you feeling?

07:54.975 --> 07:57.609
Better. Turns out you don't
even need an appendix.

07:57.611 --> 07:59.110
I don't even miss it
anymore.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.612
It's like circuit city.

08:00.614 --> 08:04.282
Anyway, I've been wanting
to talk to you about something.

08:04.284 --> 08:05.584
This house is fantastic.

08:05.586 --> 08:07.586
I should have gone into
the closet business.

08:07.588 --> 08:08.920
Right?

08:08.922 --> 08:10.822
I'm giving him a tour.
Andy, this is will.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.691
Hi.
Nice to meet you.

08:14.661 --> 08:15.961
I'm sorry.
I have to take this.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.496
It's the hospital.

08:18.764 --> 08:20.165
He's a doctor.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.434
I met him the same day I Came
to visit you in the hospital.

08:22.436 --> 08:23.602
Isn't that funny?

08:25.205 --> 08:26.438
Super-funny.

08:26.440 --> 08:28.507
So, wait. What did you want
to talk to me about?

08:29.509 --> 08:30.542
Ohhh...

08:30.544 --> 08:33.178
Just that
this little heck-raiser

08:33.179 --> 08:35.547
Needs to take a nap,
but he's been fighting it.

08:35.549 --> 08:38.683
Oh, I've got an idea.
Luke had the same problem.

08:38.684 --> 08:41.052
I'm <i>so </i> tired.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.554
Let's go to bed.

08:42.556 --> 08:43.554
Both of us?

08:43.557 --> 08:44.389
Mm.

08:44.391 --> 08:45.790
Together? Me too?

08:45.792 --> 08:49.694
Yes, because we are sleepy
and it's nap time!

08:49.696 --> 08:51.863
Now wait.
He'll climb in bed with us.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.332
Just give him a minute.

08:54.334 --> 08:55.800
Okay.

08:55.802 --> 08:57.702
Since we're
just lying here...

08:57.704 --> 08:58.703
Mm-hmm.

08:58.705 --> 08:59.838
...Do you remember
when you...

08:59.840 --> 09:01.072
sorry about that.

09:01.074 --> 09:02.073
Oh! Gosh!

09:02.075 --> 09:03.174
Oh, gosh.

09:03.176 --> 09:04.342
You're gone
for two minutes,

09:04.344 --> 09:05.877
You come back and find us
in the big-boy bed.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.546
I can only imagine
what you're thinking.

09:07.548 --> 09:09.981
That you're trying to get
this little kid to take a nap?

09:09.983 --> 09:12.384
How smart is he?

09:12.386 --> 09:13.752
Say something medical.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.053
20cc... stat.

09:16.356 --> 09:18.690
I don't understand a word,
but it gets me going.

09:20.928 --> 09:23.395
I mean, what kind
of store policy is that?

09:23.397 --> 09:26.698
I-I can't return a coat
that I put on <i>one </i> time at home?

09:26.700 --> 09:27.999
Getting out
of the shower.

09:28.001 --> 09:29.601
Yeah, you didn't help
by pointing that out.

09:29.603 --> 09:31.202
What are you
gonna tell daddy?

09:31.204 --> 09:33.204
Well, I guess I'm just gonna
tell him I made a mistake.

09:33.206 --> 09:34.406
You know,
like I say, sweetie,

09:34.408 --> 09:37.275
Honesty is always
the best policy.

09:37.277 --> 09:38.710
Unless...

09:38.712 --> 09:40.211
And stay with me here...

09:40.213 --> 09:41.580
Where would I go?

09:41.582 --> 09:43.615
...I convince your daddy to wait
on the apartment upstairs

09:43.617 --> 09:45.850
Until I have enough time
to sell your coat,

09:45.852 --> 09:48.520
And, if need be,
even sell <i>mine.</i>

09:48.522 --> 09:52.958
Thanks for selling mine first,
Dr. Chicago.

09:52.960 --> 09:54.626
If I'm reading this
properly,

09:54.628 --> 09:56.628
I'm supposed to
put a lime in your mouth,

09:56.630 --> 09:58.029
Salt on your stomach,

09:58.031 --> 10:00.131
And drink it
out of your bellybutton.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.333
You wish.

10:04.370 --> 10:06.504
That'll get you there.

10:09.475 --> 10:11.142
Oh.
Whoa, Nelly.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.446
Hey, pace yourself!
This stuff is strong.

10:14.448 --> 10:16.314
I'll know
when I've had enough.

10:17.316 --> 10:18.416
Oh, hey.
I got it lit.

10:18.418 --> 10:20.218
I could feel it
inside the house.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.553
They're gonna need
dental records

10:21.555 --> 10:22.921
To identify
those chickens.

10:22.923 --> 10:23.955
You'll be singing
a different tune

10:23.957 --> 10:26.057
Once I pop on
the rotisserie feature.

10:26.059 --> 10:29.828
Get ready for these birds
and your head to spin.

10:30.997 --> 10:32.631
That's moving
pretty fast.

10:32.633 --> 10:33.798
Simple adjustment.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.600
Oh. That seems to have...
Sped it up.

10:35.602 --> 10:38.336
H-how about you skim dinner
out of my pool?

10:38.338 --> 10:40.105
I'll get
my old grill out.

10:40.107 --> 10:41.773
Why is this
even a setting?!

10:41.775 --> 10:43.141
Oh, hey!

10:43.143 --> 10:44.809
Hey, where the hell did you go,
you coward?

10:44.811 --> 10:46.678
Oh, what... just 'cause
dad took your money back,

10:46.680 --> 10:48.113
I'm supposed to give him
all mine, too?

10:48.115 --> 10:50.081
Yes, yes. Because it was
your stupid idea. Okay?

10:50.083 --> 10:52.951
Oh, my god. How am I
gonna tell Cam I gave away
his entire inheritance?

10:52.953 --> 10:54.252
I don't know.

10:54.254 --> 10:56.921
Oh, hey! Is there
a future doctor in the house?

10:56.923 --> 10:58.757
Yeah, I think he's upstairs,
feeling up Haley.

10:58.759 --> 11:01.526
No...
<i>You, </i> Alex einstein.

11:01.528 --> 11:03.862
Whatever you're doing,
please stop.

11:03.864 --> 11:04.829
She's still mad.

11:04.831 --> 11:05.764
Yeah, so am I.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.165
It's not fair, okay?

11:07.167 --> 11:09.668
Dad gave you the same amount
of money for <i>your </i> down payment.

11:09.670 --> 11:12.203
What?
Jay loaned us that money?

11:12.205 --> 11:13.805
Oh, my god. You don't know.
Yes. Yes.

11:13.807 --> 11:15.807
Makes you wonder
what else she's lied about, huh?

11:15.809 --> 11:17.642
Wait... I've owed Jay money
for 20 years,

11:17.644 --> 11:18.710
And you never told me?

11:18.712 --> 11:20.145
I didn't think
you'd want to take it.

11:20.147 --> 11:21.613
I finally understand
the invisible wall

11:21.615 --> 11:23.281
That's been between Jay and me
all this time.

11:23.283 --> 11:25.617
This is why we're not laughing
about that crazy grill,

11:25.619 --> 11:27.519
Taking an awesome selfie
with it,

11:27.521 --> 11:28.853
Posting it on instagram,

11:28.855 --> 11:30.689
Sending hilarious e-mails
back and forth!

11:30.691 --> 11:31.790
"remember
when the grill went nuts?"

11:31.792 --> 11:33.324
"oh, yeah.
That was hilarious."

11:33.326 --> 11:34.793
<i>"you're </i> hilarious."

11:34.795 --> 11:35.827
So what, he's a doctor?

11:35.829 --> 11:36.861
<i>I </i> could be a doctor.

11:36.863 --> 11:38.163
I still have
the white coat

11:38.165 --> 11:40.065
From when I worked
at the clinique counter.

11:40.067 --> 11:42.367
Hey. So, Gloria says
it's Joe's bath time.

11:42.369 --> 11:43.234
He just had one.

11:43.236 --> 11:44.636
What's with the robe,
hef?

11:44.638 --> 11:46.838
I don't know who that is,
but I took off my shirt

11:46.840 --> 11:48.807
To protect it
from splash gordon over here.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.175
Adorbs.

11:50.177 --> 11:51.710
Can you grab me
that juice box?

11:51.712 --> 11:53.845
Yeah, sure.

11:53.847 --> 11:55.814
Anyway...

11:55.816 --> 11:57.649
Like I was saying before,

11:57.651 --> 11:59.984
Remember how,
when I was in the hospital...

11:59.986 --> 12:01.186
Oh, no!

12:01.188 --> 12:03.388
Oh, man,
this is gonna stain!

12:03.390 --> 12:04.723
I need to take it off
and soak it.

12:04.725 --> 12:05.924
Uh, uh...

12:05.926 --> 12:07.892
You could put on my shirt.
It's hanging right there.

12:07.894 --> 12:09.494
Oh, thanks.

12:11.564 --> 12:14.199
It's a little boxy.
Do you have a chunky belt?

12:14.201 --> 12:15.934
Uh... Yeah, I guess.

12:15.936 --> 12:18.169
I'm kidding.

12:18.171 --> 12:20.405
It's not like I'm gonna be
wearing this for long anyways.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.073
Wow. This looks bad.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.508
And this looks
even worse.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.677
But there's
a perfectly good explanation.

12:25.679 --> 12:27.912
Hey, babe. You spill something
on your dress?

12:27.914 --> 12:29.614
Really?
That was your first guess?

12:29.616 --> 12:31.549
Yeah, I was giving andy
a juice box.

12:31.551 --> 12:33.518
Mm. Not to drink...
Because I'm a man.

12:33.520 --> 12:34.919
Okay, so,
I'm gonna go get a dress

12:34.921 --> 12:36.387
And some shoes
from Gloria's closet.

12:36.389 --> 12:37.589
What happened
to your shoes?

12:37.591 --> 12:38.656
Nothing.

12:40.860 --> 12:41.893
Okay.

12:41.895 --> 12:43.862
I've been watching
the two of you,

12:43.864 --> 12:45.630
And it's pretty obvious.

12:45.632 --> 12:46.865
Finally.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.533
You know
how to make her laugh.

12:48.535 --> 12:49.768
Anyway, I got Haley
a little gift,

12:49.770 --> 12:51.636
And I want to write
something cute on the card.

12:51.638 --> 12:53.238
I thought you could help me,
because...

12:53.240 --> 12:55.540
Because
you're not good with words.

12:55.542 --> 12:56.608
Well, I'm a doctor.

12:56.610 --> 12:58.476
I can't admit
I'm not good at something.

12:58.478 --> 12:59.944
But... Please?

12:59.946 --> 13:01.079
Yeah.

13:01.081 --> 13:02.213
Fine.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.885
Just...
Write how you feel.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.953
Something like...

13:08.955 --> 13:11.723
"dear Haley,
I know how eyes work,

13:11.725 --> 13:15.093
But I never knew
how they sparkled until I..."

13:15.095 --> 13:16.795
That could be
macular degeneration.

13:16.797 --> 13:18.463
Just write.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.432
We need to sober up.

13:21.434 --> 13:24.302
Right after I call
an ex-girlfriend.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.304
I think I still love her.

13:26.306 --> 13:27.939
Hey. Sorry we're late.

13:27.941 --> 13:29.307
Hey. No, that's fine.
No worries.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.909
Um, so, listen,
my stupid sister...

13:30.911 --> 13:32.811
Look, I don't want
that apartment anymore.

13:32.813 --> 13:33.912
Oh, me neither.
Yeah, it's just that...

13:33.914 --> 13:35.313
Well, I thought
you had your heart set on it.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.448
I did, but then you made
such a compelling case.

13:37.450 --> 13:39.517
Hey, mitch, I got to tell you,
I was really impressed

13:39.519 --> 13:41.119
With you
paying back that loan.

13:41.121 --> 13:42.587
I'm sorry.
What? Excuse me?

13:42.589 --> 13:44.255
I'm sorry.
I should be thanking <i>you, </i> too.

13:44.257 --> 13:46.424
I forgot about that down payment
I helped you guys with.

13:46.426 --> 13:47.592
It was so long ago.

13:47.594 --> 13:48.626
Anyway, yeah.

13:48.628 --> 13:50.762
Nice birthday surprise.
Yeah.

13:50.764 --> 13:52.263
You gave him my money,
didn't you?

13:52.265 --> 13:53.798
<i>Your </i> money? I thought
you said it was <i>our </i> money.

13:53.800 --> 13:54.966
Why would it be
<i>our </i> money?

13:54.968 --> 13:56.434
You didn't even know
my uncle remus.

13:56.436 --> 13:57.602
Wasn't it cyrus?

13:57.604 --> 13:59.037
I think I would know
the name of the saint

13:59.039 --> 14:00.205
That practically raised me.

14:00.207 --> 14:01.339
Hmm.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.374
I forgot to give grandpa
his birthday crown.

14:03.376 --> 14:04.809
Wait a minute.
What's this?

14:04.811 --> 14:06.878
Uh...
Does Lily have a fur?

14:06.880 --> 14:07.879
Oh, boy.

14:07.881 --> 14:08.880
Yeah, uh, let's see.

14:08.882 --> 14:10.448
Oh, it's from schwartzman's,
huh?

14:10.450 --> 14:11.950
The same store
that you and Lily

14:11.952 --> 14:14.118
Just love to browse in
every Sunday after brunch.

14:14.120 --> 14:17.722
Well, if you must know,
it was a surprise gift for <i>you.</i>

14:17.724 --> 14:19.858
Now it's going back,
because you're a thief.

14:19.860 --> 14:21.159
Oh, well, then,
I want to try it on.
No!

14:21.161 --> 14:22.827
I want to try it on.
You'll just get attached.

14:22.829 --> 14:24.362
Well, it's a present for me,
so I should be able

14:24.364 --> 14:26.497
To have a fitting
of some sort.

14:26.499 --> 14:27.799
Of course
it needs altering.

14:27.801 --> 14:29.601
Since when do you wear
right off the rack?

14:31.837 --> 14:33.571
Oh.

14:33.573 --> 14:36.507
I'm just not comfortable
with vesuvius over there.

14:36.509 --> 14:38.042
I hope you can get
your money back.

14:38.044 --> 14:39.711
"money back"...
There it is.

14:39.713 --> 14:41.512
Huh?
There's a shadow
that's been cast

14:41.514 --> 14:43.414
Over this relationship
for quite a while now.

14:43.416 --> 14:45.149
Is this about that time
you were sleepwalking

14:45.151 --> 14:47.151
And Came in my tent
and kissed my neck?

14:47.153 --> 14:50.154
Somnamorousness... the condition
no one wants to talk about.

14:50.156 --> 14:51.222
You're right about that.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.891
This is actually
much more embarrassing.

14:52.893 --> 14:56.394
I just found out you lent us
money for our down payment.

14:56.396 --> 14:57.495
So...

14:57.497 --> 14:58.563
Here.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.899
Paid back in full.

15:00.901 --> 15:02.834
Phil, is this
because Mitchell...

15:02.836 --> 15:05.169
No. This is for me...
For <i>us.</i>

15:05.171 --> 15:08.373
And though it may be
long overdue, thank you.

15:08.375 --> 15:09.974
You're welcome.

15:12.211 --> 15:14.012
Probably seems awkward,
but...

15:14.014 --> 15:15.179
It's happening.

15:15.181 --> 15:17.248
...Could you throw that apron
on me?

15:23.689 --> 15:25.123
You're not sleeping again?
Oh.

15:29.395 --> 15:30.862
Maybe we should have
another pot of coffee.

15:30.864 --> 15:32.563
That's a weird word, huh?
Coffee. Coffee. Coffee.

15:32.565 --> 15:33.798
Amateur.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.633
Doctor! I need your help.

15:35.635 --> 15:38.937
I've been drinking this tequila,
and I cannot find the worm.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.438
I think
I just swallow it.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.773
That's very serious.

15:41.775 --> 15:43.775
That worm could eat your insides
in a matter of hours.

15:43.777 --> 15:45.977
Well, there must be <i>something</i>
she can do.

15:45.979 --> 15:47.412
Drink pickle juice.

15:47.414 --> 15:49.380
The worm cannot survive
in pickle juice.

15:49.382 --> 15:51.182
Is this enough?
Just.

15:52.284 --> 15:54.886
Ahh! Thank you, doctor.
I'm feeling better already.

15:54.888 --> 15:56.287
You got lucky.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.456
The only other treatment is
to freeze the worm to death

15:58.458 --> 16:02.126
By lowering the body temperature
with an ice bath.

16:02.128 --> 16:03.828
I feel it
inside of me.

16:03.830 --> 16:05.897
No. I think
it's inside of <i>me.</i>

16:05.899 --> 16:08.599
I knew we should've poured
the tequila in your bellybutton.

16:08.601 --> 16:10.668
That's why they have
these systems in place.

16:12.905 --> 16:14.405
Whoa!

16:14.407 --> 16:16.007
I heard an expensive car
pull out.

16:16.009 --> 16:17.508
I figured
you were in it.

16:17.510 --> 16:19.577
Oh, yeah, that was will
going to the hospital.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.412
I just Came
to get my dress.

16:21.414 --> 16:24.983
Oh. Um, he gave me this card,
but he writes like a doctor.

16:24.985 --> 16:26.417
Can you read it for me?

16:26.419 --> 16:30.021
Mnh-mnh. No.
That sounds way too personal.

16:30.023 --> 16:32.590
Ohh, come on!
I visited you in the hospital.

16:32.592 --> 16:33.758
Just do it!

16:33.760 --> 16:34.959
Nah, I'm okay.

16:34.961 --> 16:36.260
Can you just see
if you can read it? I can't.

16:36.262 --> 16:38.363
I'd rather not.
Can you even read?
Can you please try?

16:38.365 --> 16:39.464
I'll try.
Yeah, no, I'll try.

16:39.466 --> 16:40.465
Thank you.
You're welcome.

16:40.467 --> 16:44.635
"dear Haley,
I know how eyes work,

16:44.637 --> 16:46.971
But I never knew
how they sparkled

16:46.973 --> 16:48.806
Until I met you.

16:48.808 --> 16:50.274
I know how hearts work,

16:50.276 --> 16:52.276
But I never knew
they could sing

16:52.278 --> 16:54.212
Until I met you.

16:54.214 --> 16:56.314
Love, will."

16:56.316 --> 16:58.349
oh, crap.

16:59.685 --> 17:01.786
Really? I thought
it was kind of sweet.

17:01.788 --> 17:03.855
The doctor part, then it
circled around back to you.

17:03.857 --> 17:06.023
Why does he have to be
so into me, you know?

17:06.026 --> 17:07.325
We met
like two weeks ago.

17:07.327 --> 17:09.861
A gold heart!
Really?

17:09.863 --> 17:12.396
I just... I guess I'm just
more into the chase right now.

17:12.398 --> 17:14.132
You know, like, the fun.

17:14.134 --> 17:16.267
I'm just not looking
for anything serious.

17:18.069 --> 17:20.204
Well, it's good
you know what you want...

17:20.205 --> 17:21.839
Before anyone got hurt.

17:21.840 --> 17:23.074
Yeah.

17:23.076 --> 17:24.308
Thanks.

17:29.681 --> 17:30.915
Of course
I have the receipt.

17:30.917 --> 17:32.850
Ow!...Kay,
what if I didn't?

17:32.852 --> 17:34.052
Oh, there she is!

17:34.054 --> 17:36.087
Okay, everybody,
I want to make a toast!

17:36.089 --> 17:37.321
Oh, any excuse.

17:37.323 --> 17:39.657
To my brilliant
daughter...

17:39.659 --> 17:40.892
So, not <i>you.</i>

17:40.894 --> 17:44.195
...Who worked for 12 years
to get into caltech,

17:44.197 --> 17:46.330
The most prestigious
college...

17:46.332 --> 17:47.932
Mom, it's really
not a big deal.

17:47.934 --> 17:49.700
Oh, honey, wait, wait, wait...
You said yourself

17:49.702 --> 17:52.603
It's the best scientist school
in the country.

17:52.605 --> 17:55.039
Well, I most definitely
did not use <i>those </i> words.

17:55.041 --> 17:56.274
Congratulations, Alex.

17:56.276 --> 17:58.042
We expect great things
from you...

17:58.044 --> 18:00.878
Unlike some of the other
children in this family.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.346
Well,
<i>I </i> snagged a doctor,

18:02.348 --> 18:04.515
So she must be
talking about <i>you.</i>

18:04.517 --> 18:06.184
Mm.
I'm very proud of you.

18:06.186 --> 18:07.251
Mwah, mwah, mwah!

18:07.253 --> 18:09.220
Okay, well,
I haven't even decided.

18:09.222 --> 18:11.022
I still might go
to my safety school.

18:11.024 --> 18:12.390
Great. Now this.

18:12.392 --> 18:14.392
If she goes to the other place,
it's even <i>more </i> expensive.

18:14.394 --> 18:16.294
It's not gonna happen.
Please.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.029
She's just trying
to punish me.

18:18.031 --> 18:19.897
And don't worry about the money.
I got my bonus.

18:19.899 --> 18:21.199
Yeah.

18:22.134 --> 18:23.734
Wait. What?
What did you do?

18:23.736 --> 18:25.436
Did you pay back my dad?
Please, please, please.

18:25.438 --> 18:26.637
No, no, no.
Yes, I did.

18:26.639 --> 18:28.239
Not that it changed
anything.

18:28.241 --> 18:29.440
Okay,
don't be mad at Phil.

18:29.442 --> 18:30.942
He's not the bad guy here.
<i>He </i> is.

18:30.944 --> 18:33.945
Look at him, sitting over there
like he's the king of the world.

18:33.947 --> 18:35.780
What father takes money
from his own children?

18:35.782 --> 18:37.615
Not like he needs it.
He lives in this palace.

18:37.617 --> 18:38.983
Meanwhile,
our whole family's

18:38.985 --> 18:40.785
Sharing a bathroom
the size of his closet.

18:40.787 --> 18:41.953
I know.
I've paced it out.

18:41.955 --> 18:43.287
Okay, what about me?

18:43.289 --> 18:45.123
My tears have barely dried,
he stole my inheritance,

18:45.125 --> 18:47.125
And I'm left holding the bag
for two fur coats.

18:47.127 --> 18:48.292
T-two?!

18:48.294 --> 18:50.094
I can get three seasons of use
out of it.

18:50.096 --> 18:52.063
Hey,
this might give you a chuckle.

18:52.065 --> 18:53.598
That money
you all paid me back...

18:53.600 --> 18:56.067
It's gonna cover
the cost of that t-bird.
Ah!

18:56.069 --> 18:58.236
Isn't that funny
how stuff works out?

18:58.238 --> 18:59.770
It sure is funny.
That's hilarious.

18:59.772 --> 19:01.172
Ohh!

19:01.174 --> 19:03.007
I can't.
It's too cold.

19:03.009 --> 19:06.277
It's either cold for 5 minutes
or cold <i>forever.</i>

19:07.280 --> 19:08.412
Come on.

19:12.652 --> 19:15.586
Funny... I always thought
I'd be found dead in a bird suit

19:15.588 --> 19:17.421
At the bottom
of the grand canyon.

19:17.423 --> 19:18.956
You still will, buddy.

19:18.958 --> 19:20.658
You still will.

19:22.295 --> 19:24.128
If I ever catch you drinking
again,

19:24.130 --> 19:26.697
Your whole school
is going to see this picture.

19:27.866 --> 19:29.367
Sh-sh-she tricked us.

19:29.369 --> 19:30.668
I know.

19:30.670 --> 19:33.671
As soon as we kill this worm,
we're gonna get her back.

19:34.640 --> 19:36.541
There's... No... Worm!

19:38.310 --> 19:40.645
Not gonna help,
kid.

19:40.647 --> 19:41.846
You're right.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.714
I can't drown my problems
in alcohol.

19:43.716 --> 19:46.184
Well, you <i>can,</i>
but that's water.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.620
You're not really
gonna turn down caltech?

19:49.622 --> 19:51.455
Oh, please don't tell me
what a great school it is,

19:51.457 --> 19:52.857
How I'm gonna graduate
in two years,

19:52.859 --> 19:54.392
And they're gonna
name a country after me.

19:54.394 --> 19:55.893
You're feeling
some pressure.

19:55.895 --> 19:57.728
What if
I'm the dumbest one there?

19:57.730 --> 19:59.030
<i>Someone </i> has to be.

19:59.032 --> 20:01.165
I could get there, be dumb,
have a nervous breakdown...

20:01.167 --> 20:03.501
Hey. You're going.
I know you.

20:03.503 --> 20:05.970
You've never backed down from
a challenge your whole life.

20:05.972 --> 20:08.472
Now, I could lie to you
and tell you it's gonna be easy.

20:08.474 --> 20:10.541
Well, do that. I'm vulnerable.
I'll believe you.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.210
It's not.
It's gonna be hard.

20:12.212 --> 20:14.946
But you and I both know this is
something you have to do.

20:16.381 --> 20:18.216
'cause if I don't,
I'll regret it my whole life.

20:18.218 --> 20:19.217
I know, I know.

20:19.219 --> 20:20.484
Yeah, that's part of it.

20:20.486 --> 20:22.720
Let's take a ride.
Want to show you something.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.722
You're not gonna drive me
into a bad neighborhood

20:24.724 --> 20:26.257
To show me how lucky I am,
are you?

20:26.259 --> 20:27.925
Shh.

20:29.828 --> 20:31.229
Well, I would
still have my money

20:31.231 --> 20:32.863
If <i>she </i> hadn't
tricked Mitchell.

20:32.865 --> 20:34.565
Oh, and it's a shame
you don't, Cam.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.867
'cause then you could buy
<i>another </i> one of those coats.

20:36.869 --> 20:38.569
Well, I didn't get
<i>anything </i> I wanted!

20:38.571 --> 20:40.338
Jay didn't even like
the world's most perfect grill.

20:41.507 --> 20:42.873
Come on!

20:42.875 --> 20:46.077
The family needs a leader,
and I can't do it forever.

20:46.079 --> 20:47.845
You can handle it.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.614
Do I have to?

20:49.616 --> 20:51.415
Heavy hangs the head.

20:54.186 --> 20:57.054
You know, college might not be
such a big, scary place

20:57.056 --> 20:58.256
If I drove up
the first...

20:58.258 --> 20:59.257
Not gonna happen.
Okay.

21:03.028 --> 21:04.228
Your brother's
in a bit of a spot money-wise,

21:04.230 --> 21:05.463
And I don't want
to embarrass him,

21:05.465 --> 21:07.865
So how about if I say
I'm giving you both a gift?

21:07.867 --> 21:10.034
That way, he doesn't feel
like a charity case.

21:10.036 --> 21:12.103
Oh. Well,
if it's to help Mitchell...

21:12.105 --> 21:13.938
Thank you, honey.

21:13.940 --> 21:16.440
S-still s-so cold.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.442
M-maybe some coffee
would warm us up.

21:18.444 --> 21:20.444
You have a problem.

21:20.446 --> 21:23.080
So, listen, how about if I say
I'm giving you both a gift?

21:23.082 --> 21:24.115
That way,
your sister...

21:24.117 --> 21:25.583
We'll take it.

21:25.585 --> 21:27.551
Lily!
We can get the hats!

21:27.553 --> 21:29.220
Yay!
