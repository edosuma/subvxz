WEBVTT

00:02.086 --> 00:03.421
Okay, so, this is

00:03.422 --> 00:04.756
where my booth

00:04.797 --> 00:06.483
- for your school carnival
- is going to go.

00:06.507 --> 00:08.443
- I know your mom - usually raises
- A lot of money

00:08.467 --> 00:10.219
- With her
- dunking-for-diamonds booth,

00:10.261 --> 00:11.680
But I have a

00:11.681 --> 00:13.097
sure-fire moneymaker.

00:13.138 --> 00:14.182
And what game of chance

00:14.183 --> 00:15.224
will you be running?

00:15.266 --> 00:17.268
The bottle ring-toss!

00:17.309 --> 00:18.561
(SQUEALS SOFTLY)

00:21.105 --> 00:22.648
This is where

00:22.649 --> 00:24.191
you're supposed to go,

00:21.105 --> 00:24.191
"Awesome! Cool! Wow!

00:24.233 --> 00:25.652
"Jessie, I love you

00:25.653 --> 00:27.069
more than anyone else

00:24.233 --> 00:27.069
in the world!"

00:27.111 --> 00:28.195
- Awesome!
- Cool!

00:28.237 --> 00:29.655
Wow!

00:29.697 --> 00:31.977
- Jessie, I love you more
- than anyone else in the world!

00:33.075 --> 00:34.535
Ow! Ow! Ow!

00:35.870 --> 00:37.631
- Hello, Jessie.
- (ALL EXCLAIM DISDAINFULLY)

00:38.414 --> 00:40.040
Walking in the park again?

00:40.082 --> 00:42.042
- I'm surprised someone
- hasn't scooped you up

00:42.084 --> 00:43.085
And put you

00:43.086 --> 00:44.086
in a plastic bag.

00:46.130 --> 00:47.548
Very funny, Hagatha.

00:47.590 --> 00:49.651
- And what are you doing here?
- Rooting for truffles?

00:51.803 --> 00:53.805
If you must know, I, too,

00:53.806 --> 00:55.807

00:55.848 --> 00:57.976

01:03.188 --> 01:04.628
Poor Manny.

01:04.629 --> 01:06.066
That explains his twitch.

01:03.188 --> 01:06.066

01:06.108 --> 01:07.109

these children.

01:16.786 --> 01:18.203
- Agatha,
- random question.

01:18.245 --> 01:19.289
Have you ever kept goats

01:19.290 --> 01:20.331
from crossing a bridge?

01:22.124 --> 01:23.709
Ha, ha, ha!

01:23.751 --> 01:25.461
- You haven't heard
- the last from me.

01:27.254 --> 01:28.881
- Jessie, if you wanna
- raise money,

Stand back, everyone.

No!

Carnivals are full

if you want to best

Agatha at the carnival,

03:28.542 --> 03:30.669
you need a fantastic booth.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.439
- Although we love
- your ring-toss concept...

03:32.463 --> 03:34.590
No, we don't.

03:34.632 --> 03:36.238
You need a big attraction

03:36.239 --> 03:37.843
to get those suckers

03:34.632 --> 03:37.843
to cough up.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.637

- petting zoo!

- Speaking of which,
- don't eat that salad.

03:52.650 --> 03:54.089
Luke, I'm sorry

03:54.090 --> 03:55.527
you can't go to the carnival.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.113
Me, too.

knock stuff over - With a ball

03:58.530 --> 03:59.865

04:02.910 --> 04:04.371

04:04.372 --> 04:05.830
across the street again?

(SCOFFS)

04:07.187 --> 04:08.499
Absolutely not!

04:08.958 --> 04:10.250

04:12.650 --> 04:13.796

Aw! He's petting

04:18.072 --> 04:19.593
a squirrel.

04:19.635 --> 04:21.242
Ooh. Actually, he's

04:21.243 --> 04:22.847
patting down a squirrel.

04:22.888 --> 04:24.682
(SCOFFS) Whoa!

04:24.723 --> 04:26.017
He is really desperate

04:26.018 --> 04:27.309
for his first arrest.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.859
Hey, Officer Petey.

04:34.860 --> 04:36.276
What happened to you?

04:36.318 --> 04:37.945
Well, let's just say,

04:37.946 --> 04:39.571
next time I try to bring

04:36.318 --> 04:39.571
a squirrel to justice,

04:39.613 --> 04:40.760
I'm gonna use

04:40.761 --> 04:41.907
teeny-tiny handcuffs.

04:43.450 --> 04:44.473
They should've covered

04:44.474 --> 04:45.494
that at the Academy.

04:45.536 --> 04:47.079
- I was supposed to
- go to an academy?

04:49.331 --> 04:50.833
That explains so much.

04:53.836 --> 04:55.438
- So, are you coming
- to the carnival tomorrow?

04:55.462 --> 04:57.381
- Sure. I'm working
- security.

04:57.422 --> 04:59.550
So never fear.

04:59.551 --> 05:01.677
I shall keep your booth

04:57.422 --> 05:01.677
safe and sound.

05:09.227 --> 05:10.896
Clearly this booth

05:10.897 --> 05:12.563
was not up to code.

05:12.604 --> 05:14.127
I'd write you up,

05:14.128 --> 05:15.649
but the squirrel

05:12.604 --> 05:15.649
ate my pencil.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.279
Hey, Jessie.

05:19.280 --> 05:20.738
Like my outfit?

05:20.779 --> 05:22.386
I'd let you borrow it,

05:22.387 --> 05:23.991
but I'm afraid the shoes

05:20.779 --> 05:23.991
are too small for you!

05:26.577 --> 05:29.329
an outfit

- to draw attention away
- from your face.

05:32.958 --> 05:34.376
If you must know,

05:34.418 --> 05:35.732
the costume is to help

05:35.733 --> 05:37.046
attract a crowd to my booth.

05:38.422 --> 05:40.299
- Well, it's certainly
- attracting me.

05:42.718 --> 05:43.719
Really?

05:45.763 --> 05:47.640
I'm Officer Petey,

05:47.641 --> 05:49.516
and I'm at your service.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.229
Corn dog?

05:53.271 --> 05:55.022
(LAUGHS) Don't mind if I do.

05:56.732 --> 05:58.776
Petey, if there was

05:58.777 --> 06:00.819
a corn dog in your holster,

06:00.861 --> 06:02.487
where's your taser?

06:02.529 --> 06:04.198
Oh.

06:04.240 --> 06:05.408
It must be

06:05.409 --> 06:06.575
in the deep fryer.

06:06.617 --> 06:07.806
Oh, this is gonna be

06:07.807 --> 06:08.994
so much paperwork!

Well, obviously,

06:14.042 --> 06:16.418
Officer Hunky-Pants

06:11.663 --> 06:16.418
wants to get with this.

06:17.962 --> 06:19.255
Only because he's

06:19.256 --> 06:20.547
been kicked in the

06:17.962 --> 06:20.547
head by a horse.

06:21.966 --> 06:23.843
Jessie, we have a great idea

06:23.844 --> 06:25.719
for a booth for you.

06:25.761 --> 06:27.826
It turns out I have

06:27.827 --> 06:29.890
a particular talent for

06:25.761 --> 06:29.890
guessing people's weight.

06:57.649 --> 06:58.669
to take care of you,

06:58.710 --> 06:59.921
but I will not scratch

06:59.922 --> 07:01.130
your cheesy toes!

07:13.767 --> 07:14.977
(GASPS) Yes!

07:15.019 --> 07:16.333
And he just hid when

07:16.334 --> 07:17.646
Officer Petey came over.

07:19.064 --> 07:20.983
- If he's hiding
- from a cop,

07:21.025 --> 07:22.943
- That must mean
- he's a criminal!

07:22.985 --> 07:24.237
Or he's seen Petey's

07:24.238 --> 07:25.487
improv act.

BOTH: Ew.

you hated carnivals.

everything I hated,

I'd never leave my room.

08:23.212 --> 08:26.965
and they don't get the prizes.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.238
At this rate,

08:28.239 --> 08:29.468
you'll have to

08:27.007 --> 08:29.468
shut down your booth

08:29.509 --> 08:30.677
before the first

08:30.678 --> 08:31.845
child throws up

08:29.509 --> 08:31.845
in the bouncy castle.

08:31.887 --> 08:33.389
(CHILD VOMITING)

08:34.390 --> 08:35.682

- the second child.

Yes!

- (SIREN WAILING)
- Pand it over!

08:47.569 --> 08:49.300

Hey, wait a minute.

08:55.850 --> 08:57.871
Why is everyone

08:53.825 --> 08:57.871
winning at my booth?

08:57.913 --> 08:59.831
Oh! Not everyone.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.375
You're a massive loser!

09:01.376 --> 09:02.876
(LAUGHING)

09:04.544 --> 09:05.984
You! You did something.

09:05.985 --> 09:07.423
You're trying to

09:04.544 --> 09:07.423
make me look bad.

09:07.465 --> 09:08.487
What could I have

09:08.488 --> 09:09.508
possibly done?

09:09.549 --> 09:11.406
You... You gave everyone here

09:11.407 --> 09:13.262
secret ring-toss lessons!

09:13.304 --> 09:14.576
And, yes, I am aware

09:14.577 --> 09:15.847
of how odd that sounds!

09:17.516 --> 09:19.393
Hey! What's the commotion?

09:19.435 --> 09:20.498
(GASPS) Do I get to

09:20.499 --> 09:21.561
cuff somebody?

09:22.271 --> 09:24.273
Nuts! Squirrel cuffs.

09:25.399 --> 09:26.651
(SIGHS) Where did I put

09:26.652 --> 09:27.901
the human-size ones?

09:29.403 --> 09:31.071
- Agatha did something
- to wreck my game

09:31.113 --> 09:32.114
So that I wouldn't

09:32.115 --> 09:33.115
make any money!

09:31.113 --> 09:33.115
Arrest her!

09:33.157 --> 09:34.825
I will not!

09:34.866 --> 09:36.556
The only thing

09:36.557 --> 09:38.245
Agatha's guilty of

09:34.866 --> 09:38.245
is being

- you're at the carnival,

10:10.735 --> 10:11.800
Keep an eye out

10:11.801 --> 10:12.863
for that shadowy figure

10:10.735 --> 10:12.863
we saw last night.

10:12.904 --> 10:14.698
- Or, I could ride
- the bumper cars

10:14.739 --> 10:16.534
- And hope some cute boy
- runs into me.

10:16.575 --> 10:17.826
(SCOFFS) Or over you.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.373
Wait! One more thing.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.249
What?

10:24.291 --> 10:25.397
I've decided I'm in more

10:25.398 --> 10:26.502
of an apple juice mood.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.381
Coming right up.

10:35.677 --> 10:37.429
Emma! I need a towel!

now dazzle you with

11:17.636 --> 11:19.159
The Great Rav-Dini

11:19.160 --> 11:20.680
did not see that coming.

- out of prizes,

11:24.059 --> 11:25.786

- all of your stuffed animals.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.104
No way!

11:27.105 --> 11:28.397
Use your own toys.

11:30.317 --> 11:32.192
my dad's bomb shelter!

11:32.234 --> 11:33.715
Look, I promised your mom

11:33.716 --> 11:35.195
I would raise a lot of money

11:32.234 --> 11:35.195
for your school,

11:35.237 --> 11:37.006
- and Agatha did something
- to sabotage my booth!

11:37.030 --> 11:38.990
(GASPS) What did she do?

11:39.032 --> 11:40.617
Okay, my theory is that

11:40.618 --> 11:42.202
she is a witch,

11:42.244 --> 11:43.975
and she put a spell

11:43.976 --> 11:45.705
on the rings to make sure

11:42.244 --> 11:45.705
no one misses!

11:45.747 --> 11:47.874
I know the science

11:47.875 --> 11:50.001
is a little shaky,

11:45.747 --> 11:50.001
but it's the best I got!

11:50.043 --> 11:51.378
And exactly what theories

11:51.379 --> 11:52.712
did you reject?

11:54.548 --> 11:56.341
Do not worry, Jessie.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.176
- Once we work
- the kinks out,

11:58.218 --> 11:59.825
This booth will make

11:59.826 --> 12:01.430
more money than

- Bollywood star?

12:06.937 --> 12:08.562
There is more to life than

12:05.309 --> 12:08.562
Legally Blonde sequels!

12:10.439 --> 12:12.232
- Not helping with
- my booth crisis!

12:12.274 --> 12:13.400
I'm gonna be reduced

12:13.401 --> 12:14.526
to giving away

12:12.274 --> 12:14.526

12:17.865 --> 12:19.323
hit with whipped cream.

12:19.364 --> 12:20.408

12:20.409 --> 12:21.450
pay for that!

I meant nobody normal.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.822
Emma, would you care

12:39.823 --> 12:41.219
to try and throw

12:38.425 --> 12:41.219
a bean bag

12:41.261 --> 12:42.741
- through the - clown's mouth?
- Sure.

12:47.601 --> 12:49.520
I meant that clown!

Sorry.

12:53.190 --> 12:54.358
On the bright side,

12:54.359 --> 12:55.526
I almost knocked that

- how did you do it?

13:08.372 --> 13:09.516
- Did Agatha put you
- up to this?

13:09.540 --> 13:11.221
- Is there glue involved?
- I have to know!

13:14.794 --> 13:16.129
I mean...

Hey, Jessie.

13:26.348 --> 13:27.599
How's it going?

13:27.641 --> 13:29.142
Ask Agatha.

13:29.184 --> 13:30.786
- You did something,
- and when I figure it out,

13:30.810 --> 13:32.563
- I'm gonna
- Union-Jack you up!

13:33.731 --> 13:35.315
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

13:36.650 --> 13:38.485
- Have you found
- anything suspicious?

13:38.527 --> 13:39.591
No. The only crime

13:39.592 --> 13:40.654
at this carnival

13:40.696 --> 13:41.843
is that the cotton candy

13:41.844 --> 13:42.989
tastes like insulation.

13:44.742 --> 13:47.098
Although Jessie is

13:47.099 --> 13:49.454
convinced Agatha sabotaged

13:44.742 --> 13:49.454
her ring-toss game.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.415
Wait a minute!

13:51.456 --> 13:52.791
Maybe Agatha was

13:52.792 --> 13:54.125
the shadowy figure we saw

13:51.456 --> 13:54.125
sneaking around last night,

13:54.167 --> 13:55.357
and she was messing up

13:55.358 --> 13:56.545
Jessie's booth!

13:56.587 --> 13:58.463
- Oh, but wait,
- Agatha's tiny.

13:58.505 --> 13:59.757
Not now.

13:59.798 --> 14:01.526
- She's wearing a clown
- costume that makes her look

14:01.550 --> 14:03.927
- Like she's about to give birth
- to clown-tuplets!

14:05.345 --> 14:06.638
Should I tell Jessie?

14:06.680 --> 14:08.515
Not yet, we need proof!

14:08.557 --> 14:10.350
Keep an eye on Agatha

14:10.351 --> 14:12.143
and see if you can

14:08.557 --> 14:12.143
catch her doing anything.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.105
- I mean, besides
- cracking the funhouse mirror.

14:16.565 --> 14:19.150
(GASPS) She's gone!

14:19.192 --> 14:20.235
Luke, do you see her?

14:21.486 --> 14:23.947
Yes! I think that's Agatha.

14:23.988 --> 14:25.783
- But she's not wearing
- the clown outfit.

14:25.824 --> 14:27.260
- Well, if you were
- committing a crime,

14:27.284 --> 14:28.910
- Would you wear
- a clown costume?

14:30.579 --> 14:32.539
- Wait! Officer Petey
- is there, too!

14:33.123 --> 14:34.416
What's going on?

14:34.458 --> 14:35.960
Now Petey's walking

14:35.961 --> 14:37.461
behind the booth.

14:37.502 --> 14:39.151
Now Agatha's

14:39.152 --> 14:40.798
grabbing a mallet

14:37.502 --> 14:40.798
and following Petey!

14:40.839 --> 14:42.215
I don't see anything!

14:46.970 --> 14:48.430
Except Agatha dragging

14:48.431 --> 14:49.889
a body-shaped bag!

- (SARCASTICALLY)
- Hmm, let me think.

15:08.032 --> 15:09.180
What could be inside

15:09.181 --> 15:10.327
a body shaped bag?

15:10.368 --> 15:12.412
(GASPS) Maybe a body!

15:12.454 --> 15:13.747
Named Officer Petey!

15:13.789 --> 15:15.624
You have to follow her!

15:15.666 --> 15:17.063
Fine, but if I even

15:17.064 --> 15:18.460
think she sees me,

15:18.502 --> 15:19.899
I'm running away faster

15:19.900 --> 15:21.296
than one of Jessie's

15:18.502 --> 15:21.296

15:28.429 --> 15:29.888
at a dumpster.

15:53.704 --> 15:55.330
(FLATLY) Yay.

15:55.372 --> 15:56.956

- Here's your prize.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.586
It's a metal hat.

16:03.380 --> 16:05.131
- Looks cooler if you
- wear it backwards.

16:10.011 --> 16:12.013
Jessie, come quick!

16:12.055 --> 16:13.432
Bertram smacked Petey

16:13.433 --> 16:14.808
with a mallet

16:12.055 --> 16:14.808
and stuffed him in a bag!

16:14.850 --> 16:16.185
Okay, that sounds

16:16.186 --> 16:17.519
like an awesome booth.

16:14.850 --> 16:17.519
I should have done that!

16:18.812 --> 16:20.731
- It's not a booth!
- It's a murder!

16:20.772 --> 16:21.920
I saw him

16:21.921 --> 16:23.066
dump Petey's body

16:20.772 --> 16:23.066
in a dumpster!

16:23.107 --> 16:24.192
- Just come!
- Wait...

- Ow!

16:27.634 --> 16:29.197
Okay, that popping noise

16:26.069 --> 16:29.197
is my shoulder.

Ow! Ow! Ow!

16:31.117 --> 16:32.992

Let go of my arm!

Great!

Now I can scratch my knee

16:33.034 --> 16:36.162
without bending.

- Jessie, forget your
- monkey arm!

16:39.123 --> 16:40.291
Officer Petey is

16:40.292 --> 16:41.459
nowhere to be seen!

16:41.501 --> 16:42.836
You know why?

16:42.837 --> 16:44.170
Because his lifeless,

16:41.501 --> 16:44.170
decaying body

16:44.212 --> 16:45.756
is in that dumpster!

16:45.797 --> 16:47.173
Now go get it.

16:48.592 --> 16:50.385
Why would I go climb

16:50.386 --> 16:52.178
inside of a dirty

16:48.592 --> 16:52.178
garbage dumpster?

16:54.305 --> 16:55.626
- Because your phone's
- in there.

I just downloaded
