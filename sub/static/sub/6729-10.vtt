01:37.649 --> 01:38.650
Stop!

01:41.736 --> 01:42.988
Stay away from me!

01:43.072 --> 01:45.908
Throw that bloody thing
away, and unlock the door!

01:49.119 --> 01:50.287
Drive!

02:16.438 --> 02:18.523
I didn't know.
Oh, my God.

02:18.607 --> 02:20.109
I didn't know you would...

02:20.192 --> 02:22.527
Hey, I'm not the bad guy here.
You wanted this.

02:22.611 --> 02:23.778
Your own mother.

02:23.862 --> 02:25.364
She was a cold-blooded monster

02:25.447 --> 02:28.908
who performed barbaric
experiments on her own son.

02:28.993 --> 02:31.996
What happened to her was justice.
The world will not miss her.

02:32.079 --> 02:34.498
Or my father, when I
get my hands on him.

02:34.581 --> 02:35.790
For Christ's sake, go!

02:35.874 --> 02:36.875
Where?

02:36.959 --> 02:39.628
To a doctor, obviously!
Someone you trust.

03:11.243 --> 03:12.327
Trish!

03:13.162 --> 03:16.456
- Stop that. Stop it.
- I have to put a bullet in my head.

03:16.540 --> 03:18.458
- No. Put it in my head.
- Stop.

03:19.251 --> 03:20.752
Ow! Jesus!

03:20.835 --> 03:22.796
It has to be in my head.

03:24.005 --> 03:26.591
- It has to be in my head!
- Open your mouth.

03:29.178 --> 03:31.763
There's a bullet in your head. Okay?

03:32.764 --> 03:35.850
You did what he said. You
followed his command.

03:37.144 --> 03:38.312
Okay?

03:39.271 --> 03:40.397
Spit it out.

03:41.398 --> 03:42.482
I couldn't stop.

03:42.566 --> 03:45.069
It's okay. You're okay.

03:45.152 --> 03:46.611
Okay.

03:47.654 --> 03:48.988
You're okay.

03:50.115 --> 03:51.408
Is anything broken?

03:51.491 --> 03:53.910
Nothing that can't be fixed.

03:53.993 --> 03:55.829
Can't say the same for him.

03:57.289 --> 03:58.623
I'll call an ambulance.

03:58.707 --> 04:00.042
- No, don't.
- No, don't.

04:00.125 --> 04:01.626
Kilgrave's not far.

04:01.710 --> 04:03.045
You call it in, he gets further away,

04:03.128 --> 04:04.504
and then we're stuck
sitting in questioning.

04:04.588 --> 04:05.589
She's right.

04:05.672 --> 04:10.009
I'll secure the scene, get some guys
in who won't muck up the evidence.

04:12.721 --> 04:14.973
Someone cut the fail-safe wire.

04:15.057 --> 04:18.101
Oh, God. Oh, no!

04:18.185 --> 04:20.769
Oh, my poor Louise.
What did he do to you?

04:21.938 --> 04:23.690
- My heart.
- No.

04:23.773 --> 04:25.650
- I have to cut out my heart!
- No.

04:26.318 --> 04:27.486
Tape!

04:27.569 --> 04:28.778
You're not cutting anything.

04:29.988 --> 04:30.989
Tape!

04:34.368 --> 04:35.369
Bind him!

04:37.079 --> 04:39.664
I have to die.

04:39.748 --> 04:42.084
Later. Right now, I'm gonna
find your psychotic son.

04:42.167 --> 04:43.377
Jess, wait!

04:44.628 --> 04:45.712
You'll lose.

04:46.755 --> 04:50.300
I've seen how powerful he is now. A
couple words and you're his weapon.

04:50.384 --> 04:51.593
He can't control me anymore.

04:51.676 --> 04:54.888
- It's time to get realistic.
- No, Trish,

04:54.971 --> 04:56.431
he said, "Let go,"

04:56.515 --> 04:58.016
and I didn't.

04:59.143 --> 05:00.352
I'm free.

05:06.733 --> 05:08.110
Good God, woman.

05:08.193 --> 05:09.861
Open the door!

05:09.944 --> 05:11.613
Bleeding human being here!

05:14.283 --> 05:16.160
I need medical attention.

05:16.243 --> 05:18.203
Jesus. Jeri, who is that?

05:18.287 --> 05:21.290
You do not get to come here and
barge in on me and make demands...

05:21.373 --> 05:22.624
- I am your patient.
- I don't know what...

05:22.707 --> 05:25.127
Get your medical bag and fix me!

05:30.799 --> 05:31.925
Interesting.

05:32.008 --> 05:33.802
I tell you to take me
to a doctor you trust,

05:33.885 --> 05:35.679
you bring me to the woman you shat on.

05:35.762 --> 05:39.140
You know what? Divorce papers can wait,
you don't have to make her sign them.

05:39.224 --> 05:40.975
'Course I do. I'm a man of my word...

05:42.352 --> 05:43.812
if I feel like it.

05:43.895 --> 05:45.314
Shut that door.

05:51.695 --> 05:53.822
- How can you be sure?
- I can feel it.

05:53.905 --> 05:55.574
It's true, I saw it.

05:56.700 --> 05:59.244
She didn't move when he told her to.

05:59.328 --> 06:02.831
At my old house, at the police station,
he said he wanted me to choose.

06:02.914 --> 06:04.999
It's because he knew he
couldn't control me.

06:05.083 --> 06:06.960
- You're immune to him?
- Yes.

06:07.711 --> 06:09.504
Will you take him to his
motel and stay with him

06:09.588 --> 06:11.047
- until the command wears off?
- Of course.

06:11.130 --> 06:13.258
Louise always believed
we'd find a vaccine.

06:14.092 --> 06:16.761
- What?
- For the virus Kevin emits.

06:17.429 --> 06:18.472
It's a virus?

06:18.555 --> 06:20.224
Micro-particles in the air.

06:20.307 --> 06:23.017
We worked for a vaccine for decades.

06:23.101 --> 06:27.063
Almost had it, but you... you
might be the missing ingredient.

06:27.146 --> 06:28.565
A cure for Kilgrave?

06:28.648 --> 06:30.066
To inoculate everyone around him.

06:30.149 --> 06:31.401
There's no time!

06:31.485 --> 06:32.819
How long would it take?

06:32.902 --> 06:35.655
Well, if I could get a
biological sample from Jessica,

06:35.739 --> 06:37.782
I'd know if it was
working within a day.

06:37.866 --> 06:40.535
No, the tape stays or you'll do
everything you can to stab yourself.

06:40.619 --> 06:41.911
Cut my heart out.

06:41.995 --> 06:44.581
Yes, this is a great time
to correct my phrasing.

06:44.664 --> 06:46.583
I'll be your hands. You guide me.

06:47.959 --> 06:49.753
Fine. Take my blood.

06:49.836 --> 06:51.880
Take my piss. Take my spleen
if you think it'll help.

06:51.963 --> 06:53.590
The gauze from the first aid kit.

06:53.673 --> 06:57.386
Wipe her arm. Get as much
uncontaminated blood as you can.

06:58.136 --> 07:00.013
I have lab equipment at my motel.

07:00.096 --> 07:02.349
Across from Barbuto on Washington.

07:02.432 --> 07:03.475
Okay, let's go.

07:07.103 --> 07:08.397
I'll call you when I find him.

07:08.480 --> 07:09.481
Okay.

07:10.940 --> 07:13.652
Give me ten minutes to clear the area.

07:13.735 --> 07:15.111
It was Hogarth.

07:16.154 --> 07:17.155
Who cut the wire.

07:17.239 --> 07:19.491
Yeah, I know. Process of elimination.

07:20.367 --> 07:21.410
Hey, hey.

07:22.118 --> 07:23.287
You got some, um...

07:24.371 --> 07:25.372
Shit.

07:33.588 --> 07:37.467
I bought Jessica her bloody childhood
home and restored it perfectly.

07:37.551 --> 07:40.345
If that's not a grand romantic gesture,
I don't know what the bloody hell is.

07:40.429 --> 07:42.306
You know what I mean, Wendy.

07:42.389 --> 07:45.642
Yeah. I took her to Paris for
our ten-year anniversary.

07:45.725 --> 07:47.686
- Shut up, Wendy.
- You shut up.

07:47.769 --> 07:51.648
She spent the entire time
on the phone with a client.

07:51.731 --> 07:54.359
Well, I gave and gave and
gave, and she took and took.

07:54.443 --> 07:55.694
You feel violated.

07:55.777 --> 07:56.820
Precisely, yeah.

07:57.987 --> 07:59.238
You ever think about revenge?

07:59.323 --> 08:02.576
Oh, sure. But how do you
avenge death by a thousand cuts?

08:04.953 --> 08:07.914
All the little slices over the
years, then the final stab,

08:07.997 --> 08:09.082
the secretary.

08:09.165 --> 08:12.251
That's nothing compared to Jessica.
She's crueler than my parents.

08:13.295 --> 08:14.463
What does she want from me?

08:17.048 --> 08:19.258
That wasn't a rhetorical question.
Tell me.

08:20.176 --> 08:22.178
She wants you to pay for
what you did to her.

08:22.261 --> 08:25.474
I treated her better
than anyone ever has.

08:26.558 --> 08:29.436
She wants you to pay for what
you did to Hope Shlottman.

08:30.144 --> 08:31.771
Yeah, tell me something I don't know.

08:32.606 --> 08:35.107
Hope Shlottman was
pregnant with your child.

08:37.611 --> 08:40.238
Jessica and I helped her to abort it.

08:46.745 --> 08:47.996
Honesty.

08:49.288 --> 08:51.165
Refreshing, isn't it?

08:51.249 --> 08:53.627
Yeah? Anything else?

08:54.669 --> 08:56.004
I kept the remains...

08:57.839 --> 09:00.174
to see if your power
could be replicated.

09:01.217 --> 09:02.218
It didn't work.

09:03.720 --> 09:04.846
You're disgusting.

09:04.929 --> 09:06.305
She's pragmatic.

09:07.557 --> 09:09.100
Where's my child now?

09:09.183 --> 09:11.853
Cold storage, Hammond Labs.

09:13.563 --> 09:14.898
Does Jessica have plans for it?

09:16.483 --> 09:18.151
She doesn't know it exists.

09:22.656 --> 09:23.990
You're done.

09:35.877 --> 09:37.086
It's Jessica.

09:39.088 --> 09:40.131
All right.

09:41.883 --> 09:43.593
Answer. Admit to nothing.

09:43.677 --> 09:47.556
Do not tell her I'm here. Oh,
find out where my father is.

09:47.639 --> 09:49.599
- Jessica?
- What happened to you?

09:49.683 --> 09:51.560
I turned around and you were gone.

09:52.436 --> 09:54.604
Well, you said to run, so I ran.

09:54.688 --> 09:56.648
<i>Kilgrave's in the wind.
Where are you now?</i>

09:56.731 --> 09:58.942
At home, just hanging low.

09:59.025 --> 10:01.528
What happened to the detective?

10:01.611 --> 10:02.904
And Kilgrave's father?

10:02.987 --> 10:04.989
<i>Trish took the detective
to the hospital.</i>

10:05.073 --> 10:07.075
<i>Albert's gone. He's
probably with Kilgrave.</i>

10:08.493 --> 10:10.244
Just stay put, I'll keep you posted.

10:11.162 --> 10:12.163
No, no, I...

10:12.246 --> 10:15.542
I saw Kilgrave run, and he
wasn't with his father.

10:17.627 --> 10:20.046
Then he's somewhere hiding
from his asshole son.

10:21.089 --> 10:23.633
<i>So you don't know where
he is, where Albert is?</i>

10:23.717 --> 10:24.968
Nope.

10:25.677 --> 10:27.386
Is that Pam? Tell her I said hi.

10:27.471 --> 10:28.930
What?

10:29.013 --> 10:30.389
<i>Just trying to be civil.</i>

10:30.474 --> 10:31.808
<i>Gotta go, bye.</i>

10:34.894 --> 10:36.270
That's bollocks.

10:36.354 --> 10:38.565
She didn't say he was dead,
which means she saved him,

10:38.648 --> 10:40.274
and she knows exactly where he is.

10:41.943 --> 10:44.028
It's her. Shit!

10:44.112 --> 10:45.947
You want death by a thousand cuts.
Do it!

10:50.744 --> 10:51.745
One.

11:09.428 --> 11:10.722
Man...

11:10.805 --> 11:12.348
you scared the hell out of me.

11:12.431 --> 11:14.142
Who are you?

11:14.225 --> 11:15.894
I'm Sergeant Simpson.

11:15.977 --> 11:17.896
Uh, you've seen me at the precinct.

11:19.689 --> 11:21.900
You're Detective Clemons, right?

11:22.567 --> 11:25.654
Yeah, you're kind of a legend. You
got a hell of a clearance rate.

11:26.571 --> 11:28.406
Sorry, Sarge.

11:28.489 --> 11:30.575
- Out of context, out of uniform.
- Uh-huh.

11:30.659 --> 11:32.536
What brings you here?

11:32.619 --> 11:35.288
That looks serious, huh? What happened?

11:35.371 --> 11:38.416
A bit of an altercation.
How'd you say you got here?

11:38.499 --> 11:42.003
Uh, Trish Walker called me, from
here, so I came as soon as I could.

11:42.086 --> 11:44.673
Well, this floor is on lockdown.
I got it under control.

11:44.756 --> 11:46.424
Well, it looks like
you could use a hand.

11:46.507 --> 11:47.508
I mean...

11:47.592 --> 11:49.343
Sorry, I didn't mean it like that.

11:54.098 --> 11:55.850
What's wrong with your leg, Officer?

11:56.935 --> 11:59.353
Jesus. Who's this?

11:59.437 --> 12:02.607
Victim of a killer who has abilities.

12:03.608 --> 12:07.070
We got all the evidence we need
now to put that bastard away.

12:09.363 --> 12:11.866
I'm gonna call for
back-up, get me a medic,

12:11.950 --> 12:14.118
while you check the perimeter outside.

12:14.202 --> 12:16.996
But if this killer has
abilities, like you say...

12:18.247 --> 12:21.500
well, maybe the system won't
be able to contain him.

12:21.585 --> 12:23.002
That's not your call, Sarge.

12:23.086 --> 12:25.546
Well, the guy isn't a purse
snatcher, Detective.

12:25.630 --> 12:26.798
He's a terrorist.

12:26.881 --> 12:29.008
Kilgrave can't be put on trial.

12:30.259 --> 12:31.510
Evidence is irrelevant.

12:32.637 --> 12:35.056
- You know who he is.
- Yeah, so do you, obviously.

12:35.139 --> 12:37.809
So you know that we can't
wait for the system.

12:37.892 --> 12:39.603
There's no jail. There's no evidence.

12:39.686 --> 12:41.145
There's only justice.

12:43.356 --> 12:44.357
Uh-uh.

12:45.483 --> 12:48.612
I have no other option.
I'm taking him out.

12:49.946 --> 12:52.573
Well, he's gone. Jessica's
looking for him now.

12:52.657 --> 12:55.952
And where's Trish Walker? Did he hurt her?
Did he do something to her?

12:56.035 --> 12:57.411
She's with someone.

12:58.705 --> 13:02.041
A scientist who thinks that he can
stop Kilgrave with a vaccine.

13:02.125 --> 13:03.417
Where are they?

13:06.087 --> 13:07.213
I'm sorry.

13:09.298 --> 13:11.259
It's ever since Kilgrave,

13:11.342 --> 13:13.136
I don't know who to trust.

13:16.723 --> 13:19.225
I don't need a weapon
to make a vaccine.

13:22.812 --> 13:25.690
Trish Walker, she trusts me.
She's the one who called me.

13:25.774 --> 13:27.400
So please, just tell me where she is.

13:28.609 --> 13:30.403
A hotel on Washington.

13:30.486 --> 13:32.030
Across from Barbuto.

14:33.842 --> 14:35.426
A thousand cuts, Wendy,

14:35.509 --> 14:37.095
- it's just a few words...
- Seventeen.

14:37.178 --> 14:39.138
- Eighteen.
- Wendy!

14:39.222 --> 14:41.557
Please! Please, stop!

14:42.225 --> 14:44.936
- A thousand cuts...
- Nineteen. Twenty.

14:45.019 --> 14:46.104
Please!

14:46.187 --> 14:47.521
Oh, my God.

14:49.315 --> 14:50.399
Twenty-one.

14:51.901 --> 14:53.152
Twenty-two.

14:53.236 --> 14:54.403
Twenty-three.

14:55.697 --> 14:56.906
Twenty-four.

14:56.990 --> 14:58.783
Twenty-five.

15:14.215 --> 15:16.050
Twenty-six.

15:16.134 --> 15:17.551
Twenty-seven.

15:17.635 --> 15:18.762
Twenty-eight.

15:18.845 --> 15:20.013
Twenty-nine.

15:56.174 --> 15:57.716
What did you do?

15:58.509 --> 16:00.261
I didn't know.

16:00.344 --> 16:01.971
How could I have known?

16:05.809 --> 16:08.686
Wendy was trying to kill her, and I...

16:09.813 --> 16:11.480
I stopped her with...

16:19.155 --> 16:21.032
Is Kilgrave still in the house?

16:21.115 --> 16:22.158
Kilgrave was here?

16:23.492 --> 16:25.161
Do you know where he was going?

16:25.244 --> 16:27.455
Find his father.

16:32.501 --> 16:34.045
Don't... don't go.

16:37.048 --> 16:38.299
Sorry, Pam.

16:38.382 --> 16:40.468
What you did was self-defense.

16:40.551 --> 16:43.096
But what you helped Kilgrave do...

16:44.013 --> 16:45.306
that was murder.

16:46.599 --> 16:48.434
You are on your own.

16:53.397 --> 16:54.858
It's okay.

16:54.941 --> 16:57.193
I'm gonna handle this.

16:57.276 --> 16:59.153
I'm gonna handle everything.

17:07.661 --> 17:10.039
He's coming for his father?

17:10.123 --> 17:11.415
She wants to use me as bait.

17:11.499 --> 17:12.834
That's not
what she's saying.

17:12.916 --> 17:14.836
I have to use him as bait.

17:14.919 --> 17:17.046
<i>He's not finished
working on the vaccine.</i>

17:17.130 --> 17:18.547
Which is a long shot.

17:18.631 --> 17:21.843
Jess, Kilgrave is wounded. He's
running from you. We've got time.

17:21.925 --> 17:24.929
Trish, your optimism
is getting in the way.

17:25.012 --> 17:27.098
<i>It's not optimism, it's survival.</i>

17:27.181 --> 17:30.559
Jess, he made me want to kill myself.
I never want to feel that again.

17:30.643 --> 17:33.146
If there is even a chance
a vaccine will work...

17:33.812 --> 17:36.315
He said he'd
know within 24 hours.

17:36.399 --> 17:37.400
Good?

17:41.070 --> 17:42.780
She has total confidence in you.

17:47.243 --> 17:49.828
You think we should wallpaper
the scaffolding first,

17:49.913 --> 17:51.372
or are trees better?

17:52.748 --> 17:55.043
Do you even have $50,000?

17:55.126 --> 17:57.795
Are you putting a price
tag on my brother's life?

17:57.879 --> 17:59.130
No, it's just...

17:59.213 --> 18:01.925
- the poster says...
- We shared a womb!

18:02.008 --> 18:03.134
You said you'd help.

18:07.680 --> 18:10.224
Maybe he just needed some
time to himself, you know?

18:10.308 --> 18:11.976
He can't even tie his shoes
without my permission.

18:12.060 --> 18:13.061
I'm serious.

18:13.144 --> 18:14.812
I am, too, that's why he
always wears slip-ons.

18:14.896 --> 18:17.941
If you're not part of the solution,
you're part of the problem.

18:18.024 --> 18:19.984
Are you part of the problem?

18:24.113 --> 18:26.199
Do every windshield on the block.

18:33.915 --> 18:36.084
If you see something, say something.

18:45.509 --> 18:47.303
Have you lost your mind?

18:47.886 --> 18:48.887
Possibly.

18:49.597 --> 18:52.183
Look, I know you feel guilty,
but this isn't gonna help.

18:52.266 --> 18:53.434
It's just gonna make it worse.

18:53.517 --> 18:56.229
I know, but she feels
better doing something.

18:57.021 --> 19:00.233
You and I both know
that he is not missing.

19:00.316 --> 19:02.276
Well, technically, he is.

19:03.987 --> 19:05.571
He's not coming back.

19:05.654 --> 19:06.990
Then we should tell her.

19:08.032 --> 19:10.618
I found her sobbing in the stairwell.

19:15.957 --> 19:18.792
Hey, that took me three
hours at Kinko's, cougar!

19:25.591 --> 19:27.301
Why would she do that?

19:28.302 --> 19:29.303
Malcolm...

19:30.513 --> 19:32.348
why would she throw out my fliers?

19:33.516 --> 19:35.768
I don't know. I'm gonna hit
the subway with these.

19:35.851 --> 19:37.436
Maybe, um...

19:37.520 --> 19:39.730
somebody saw him get on a train.

19:46.404 --> 19:49.157
Babe, we're gonna get you back.

20:29.238 --> 20:30.531
Hello, Jessica.

20:33.451 --> 20:35.453
You can't control me anymore, asshole.

20:35.536 --> 20:38.039
I've known
that for some time.

20:38.122 --> 20:40.124
You, however, a little
slow on the uptake.

20:40.208 --> 20:42.335
I could kill you right
here and right now.

20:42.418 --> 20:45.796
But you won't, because you don't
know what will happen when I die.

20:49.092 --> 20:50.176
Good choice.

20:50.259 --> 20:52.511
There would've been a rash of
suicides across the neighborhood,

20:52.595 --> 20:53.596
and who would've been to blame?

20:53.679 --> 20:55.639
Not me, you prick.

20:55.723 --> 20:57.308
You keep
telling yourself that.

20:57.391 --> 20:59.017
Maybe you'll actually
believe it someday.

21:00.519 --> 21:03.314
You know what I call this
phase of our relationship?

21:03.397 --> 21:04.440
Finished.

21:04.523 --> 21:05.608
I call it "the wrath."

21:05.691 --> 21:08.111
First, the Shlottmans,
then their daughter,

21:08.194 --> 21:11.155
then that baby-faced boy
who slit his own throat,

21:11.239 --> 21:13.282
Mummy, obviously,

21:13.366 --> 21:15.534
your lawyer, presumably...

21:15.618 --> 21:17.661
It's quite a roster you've inspired.

21:17.745 --> 21:18.912
Who's next?

21:18.996 --> 21:19.997
You.

21:20.081 --> 21:21.457
I doubt it.

21:21.540 --> 21:23.084
You think I won't kill you

21:23.167 --> 21:25.503
because some strangers
might stab themselves?

21:26.212 --> 21:28.172
Uh, poison, actually, but no.

21:28.256 --> 21:30.799
It's because you want what I have.

21:32.176 --> 21:34.137
A stupid name and a death wish?

21:34.845 --> 21:36.013
I have Hope.

21:37.014 --> 21:39.057
The person, not the feeling.
Well, the feeling, too.

21:39.142 --> 21:40.559
- I'm a hopeful man.
- Where is she?

21:40.643 --> 21:43.354
She's the living embodiment
of your guilt, isn't she?

21:45.689 --> 21:47.065
I don't have to kill you!

21:49.443 --> 21:50.528
For God's sake!

21:50.611 --> 21:54.657
In prison, of course, until her release
papers go through tomorrow morning!

21:59.953 --> 22:02.331
I visited the DA today.

22:03.374 --> 22:06.210
I suggested to him that
Hope was innocent.

22:06.294 --> 22:07.795
He agreed,

22:07.878 --> 22:11.299
as did the judge who signed
Hope's release papers.

22:11.382 --> 22:12.883
I am exceedingly convincing.

22:12.966 --> 22:14.218
Why?

22:15.594 --> 22:17.138
Oh, I could have staged her escape,

22:17.221 --> 22:19.432
but she'd be on the lam
for the rest of her life,

22:19.515 --> 22:21.517
so I procured her release
quite legitimately.

22:21.600 --> 22:24.144
Well, there's a paper
trail, in any event.

22:25.563 --> 22:27.856
You want more wrath.

22:29.149 --> 22:30.484
One more body.

22:31.151 --> 22:32.486
Not Hope Shlottman's.

22:33.654 --> 22:36.282
She walks out of the
prison doors tomorrow,

22:36.365 --> 22:38.742
and your conscience gets wiped clean.

22:39.910 --> 22:42.371
Unless I change my mind.

22:43.121 --> 22:44.207
Your father.

22:44.290 --> 22:46.667
See how well you know me?

22:46.750 --> 22:47.751
Dad for Hope.

22:47.835 --> 22:49.712
You get the better part
of that deal, by the way.

22:51.046 --> 22:52.340
What a bargain.

22:53.173 --> 22:55.926
I stay as far away
from you as I can get,

22:56.009 --> 22:57.636
and you go back to your life of...

22:58.637 --> 23:00.848
mediocrity and underachievement.

23:05.811 --> 23:07.980
I don't know if I can
track Albert down.

23:08.063 --> 23:09.565
Mmm.

23:09.648 --> 23:11.900
What you need is an ace P.I.

23:13.068 --> 23:14.528
Know any?

23:23.287 --> 23:24.622
Thank you.

23:30.836 --> 23:32.170
Have they questioned you?

23:33.171 --> 23:34.423
Have you said anything?

23:35.633 --> 23:36.842
That's good.

23:37.968 --> 23:41.430
- Now we just need to...
- How did Kilgrave even know Wendy?

23:42.180 --> 23:43.641
How did he get there?

23:44.892 --> 23:46.352
It's complicated.

23:48.103 --> 23:50.981
That's what you say when you're lying.

23:51.064 --> 23:53.567
I'm on all your calls. It's
what you say when you're...

23:53.651 --> 23:55.278
- when you're lying.
- Pam. Pammy.

23:56.362 --> 23:58.406
You're not thinking straight right now.

23:58.489 --> 24:00.449
I thought maybe you were
having it out with Wendy.

24:00.533 --> 24:02.285
- I was worried.
- I should have called.

24:02.368 --> 24:03.661
I'm sorry.

24:06.622 --> 24:09.166
You brought him there.

24:09.875 --> 24:12.920
To make Wendy sign the divorce papers.

24:13.003 --> 24:14.630
That's not how it happened.

24:14.713 --> 24:17.841
Then tell me he made you do it.

24:17.925 --> 24:19.217
Just tell me that.

24:19.302 --> 24:20.386
He did.

24:21.679 --> 24:23.389
It was complicated.

24:27.893 --> 24:29.312
You did this.

24:29.395 --> 24:31.564
You told me to handle it.

24:31.647 --> 24:33.065
That's what you said.

24:33.148 --> 24:35.025
So you turn me into a murderer?

24:35.108 --> 24:36.319
I didn't do anything.

24:37.570 --> 24:40.698
You chose to pick up that thing...

24:40.781 --> 24:43.241
and crush her skull.

24:43.326 --> 24:44.743
You did that.

24:46.662 --> 24:49.498
So now that I understand
your bullshit...

24:51.375 --> 24:54.086
it's all that I see when I look at you.

24:55.128 --> 24:56.339
You're repulsive.

24:59.257 --> 25:00.968
We're taking you to booking.

25:01.719 --> 25:03.136
Don't say anything to anyone.

25:03.220 --> 25:05.013
Detective, I need to call a lawyer.

25:05.097 --> 25:07.475
- She said she was your lawyer.
- No.

25:07.558 --> 25:09.477
I have no idea who this woman is.

25:32.165 --> 25:34.460
You're stalling, Jessica.

25:34.543 --> 25:35.711
I'm peeing!

25:37.295 --> 25:38.964
No, you're not.

25:39.548 --> 25:41.717
You're buying time.

25:42.843 --> 25:44.470
For what?

25:44.553 --> 25:48.056
For dear old Dad to run and hide,
like the coward that he is.

25:48.140 --> 25:50.768
You can control minds, but you
can't read them for shit.

25:50.851 --> 25:52.936
He won't come willingly, you know.

25:53.020 --> 25:54.980
He's not gonna care that some
young woman's life's at stake.

25:55.063 --> 25:56.857
Glass houses, asshole.

25:56.940 --> 25:59.485
Oh, God, I'll miss that.

26:00.569 --> 26:03.113
Your provincial yet snappy repartee.

26:03.196 --> 26:04.657
We make a good team.

26:04.740 --> 26:08.035
You're a lot of shitty things, but I
never thought you were delusional.

26:08.118 --> 26:09.161
Oh.

26:10.162 --> 26:12.665
Oh, I see things very clearly.

26:12.748 --> 26:14.833
Not if you think I could
ever feel anything for you

26:14.917 --> 26:16.334
other than pure disgust.

26:17.586 --> 26:18.962
Well, that's crap.

26:19.046 --> 26:22.425
I never, not for one second...

26:22.508 --> 26:25.218
No, not one second. Eighteen.

26:25.302 --> 26:26.512
In what universe?

26:26.595 --> 26:27.930
Ours.

26:29.389 --> 26:30.766
On that rooftop.

26:32.435 --> 26:33.602
You remember.

26:51.995 --> 26:54.957
<i>It had been 12 hours.
I timed it.</i>

26:55.040 --> 26:57.793
I hadn't told you to do anything.

26:58.586 --> 27:01.714
And then for 18 seconds, I
wasn't controlling you.

27:03.549 --> 27:04.842
And you stayed with me.

27:05.676 --> 27:08.095
With me, because you wanted to.

27:08.178 --> 27:10.222
That's why you thought
you had a shot with me?

27:10.305 --> 27:12.390
You can't tell me you don't remember.

27:12.475 --> 27:13.976
I remember vividly.

27:16.394 --> 27:19.064
I had waited so long for that moment.

27:20.524 --> 27:23.110
For one single opportunity
to get away from you.

27:26.864 --> 27:29.241
It's getting chilly, let's go in.

27:29.324 --> 27:31.702
I'll clean this up, and
we'll continue inside.

27:32.786 --> 27:34.204
All right, darling.

28:54.785 --> 28:56.745
Jessica, come in, darling.

29:01.333 --> 29:02.876
Come down from there.

29:07.965 --> 29:09.800
What revisionist bullshit!

29:09.883 --> 29:11.552
I remember everything.

29:11.635 --> 29:14.137
- You didn't jump.
- Because I wasn't fast enough.

29:14.221 --> 29:18.141
Getting you out of my head was
like prying fungus from a window.

29:18.225 --> 29:20.185
I couldn't think.

29:20.268 --> 29:22.187
I know your face. I saw you...

29:22.270 --> 29:23.355
You saw what you wanted to see.

29:23.438 --> 29:26.483
- I remember...
- I remember everything!

29:27.317 --> 29:29.236
Come down now, Jessica!

29:31.363 --> 29:32.530
Why don't you listen to me?

29:34.700 --> 29:36.243
Because I don't want to.

29:36.326 --> 29:39.580
If you don't listen to me, what
is the point of having ears?

29:39.663 --> 29:40.748
Answer me!

29:41.957 --> 29:43.626
To listen to someone else.

29:45.252 --> 29:48.088
You never appreciate
anything I do for you.

29:50.048 --> 29:52.217
If you can't listen to
me, you don't need ears.

29:52.300 --> 29:53.636
Cut them off.

30:01.644 --> 30:03.896
Stop. Stop. Stop. It's all right.

30:04.897 --> 30:06.189
It's all right.

30:06.273 --> 30:07.941
I'm here, Jessica.

30:10.402 --> 30:12.154
I'll always be here.

30:16.992 --> 30:18.869
You wanted to stay with me. Admit it.

30:19.953 --> 30:21.038
You admit this.

30:32.215 --> 30:33.550
Speak up, asshole.

30:33.634 --> 30:34.927
I'm all ears.

30:38.722 --> 30:41.558
And sometimes, on good days...

30:42.600 --> 30:44.561
I even catch myself smiling again.

30:44.645 --> 30:45.896
Thanks, Emma.

30:46.730 --> 30:48.565
I'm glad you're returning to yourself.

30:49.983 --> 30:51.777
Anyone else?

30:51.860 --> 30:52.903
Don?

30:52.986 --> 30:55.405
I already bared my soul, Malcolm.

30:55.488 --> 30:57.240
And it hasn't gotten me back my son.

30:59.159 --> 31:01.704
Yeah, we all share the same shame.

31:01.787 --> 31:05.082
I'm not ashamed. It's not my fault.
We're victims.

31:05.165 --> 31:07.084
Well, we're not anymore.

31:08.418 --> 31:10.754
- Not if we help each other...
- Who have you helped?

31:12.005 --> 31:14.549
Malcolm, you don't have to talk.

31:18.846 --> 31:21.348
Well,
I've helped my friend.

31:22.515 --> 31:25.185
She saved me, and I saved her.

31:26.144 --> 31:28.105
Kilgrave set her up.

31:28.897 --> 31:30.190
For murder.

31:30.273 --> 31:32.275
And he killed this...

31:32.359 --> 31:34.569
this guy who hadn't done
anything to anyone.

31:34.652 --> 31:36.989
He made him cut his own throat.

31:37.072 --> 31:38.281
And I fixed it.

31:38.365 --> 31:41.118
All right? I wrapped his body in a
comforter and dragged it to the elevator,

31:41.201 --> 31:44.329
and, I mean, it's like his ghost
is still in the building.

31:44.412 --> 31:47.082
And his sister, I mean, she's just...
she's destroyed.

31:47.165 --> 31:50.210
But I can't tell her the truth
until Jessica gets Kilgrave.

31:50.293 --> 31:52.004
And she's so close.

31:52.087 --> 31:54.923
But, I just... I can't lie anymore.

31:55.007 --> 31:57.342
Thank you for your share.

31:59.219 --> 32:00.220
Yeah.

32:01.221 --> 32:04.516
Thank you so much for
that illuminating share.

32:04.599 --> 32:05.851
Oh, my God, you shouldn't
have followed me.

32:05.934 --> 32:07.352
I am so sorry, Robyn.

32:07.435 --> 32:09.521
Sorry to bust up the kumbaya
circle jerk, but...

32:09.604 --> 32:11.523
- There's no cross talk here.
- Oh, really?

32:11.606 --> 32:14.442
'Cause I'm cross and I'm
talking, so blow me, Emma!

32:14.526 --> 32:17.529
- Hey, let me just take you home.
- You murdered my brother.

32:17.612 --> 32:18.781
Kilgrave murdered him.

32:18.864 --> 32:20.407
Where's Ruben's body?

32:22.117 --> 32:23.786
Where is his heart?

32:24.494 --> 32:26.579
Where are his little toes?

32:28.040 --> 32:30.458
Holy shit, I feel like
I've been cut in half.

32:30.959 --> 32:33.921
Kilgrave has caused
us all enormous loss.

32:34.004 --> 32:35.380
So I've heard.

32:35.463 --> 32:36.882
Oh, poor me.

32:37.465 --> 32:40.468
I feel your sadness, but
where is your rage?

32:40.552 --> 32:43.513
Aren't you sick of hearing
yourselves talk and talk and talk?

32:43.596 --> 32:44.765
I am.

32:44.848 --> 32:46.641
Well, look, too bad, I mean...

32:46.724 --> 32:48.643
That's all we've got.

32:48.726 --> 32:51.479
Jessica is the only one
that can take on Kilgrave.

32:51.563 --> 32:53.440
Are you so sure that's
what she's gonna do?

32:53.523 --> 32:54.607
She will try like hell.

32:54.691 --> 32:56.276
While we sit here and wait.

32:57.402 --> 32:59.737
Would this Kilgrave cat
have hurt any of you

32:59.822 --> 33:02.074
if Jessica Jones hadn't pissed him off?

33:02.866 --> 33:06.119
That's what I'm piecing together
from all of this goddamn sharing.

33:06.203 --> 33:10.123
Each of his atrocities can
be traced back to her.

33:10.207 --> 33:12.334
What exactly does she want?

33:12.417 --> 33:14.086
Jessica brought us all together.

33:14.169 --> 33:15.712
To control you.

33:15.796 --> 33:17.297
She is one of us.

33:17.380 --> 33:20.467
- Then why isn't she here?
- Maybe she's in cahoots with the psycho.

33:20.550 --> 33:22.970
No one is in cahoots
with anyone, all right?

33:23.053 --> 33:24.805
There is no conspiracy.

33:24.888 --> 33:28.266
You don't know shit about Kilgrave
or what he is capable of.

33:28.350 --> 33:32.104
Well, you're right, my
two-faced former friend.

33:32.770 --> 33:34.940
But I do know Jessica Jones.

33:36.817 --> 33:41.321
And I am gonna track that
wannabe gumshoe down

33:41.404 --> 33:44.199
and make her explain herself to me.

33:45.158 --> 33:46.659
Who's with me?

33:48.245 --> 33:49.496
She's right.

33:49.579 --> 33:51.248
Jessica knows more
than she's letting on.

33:51.331 --> 33:54.084
Look, trust me, this
is not a good idea.

33:54.167 --> 33:56.211
And why should we trust you?

33:56.294 --> 33:59.381
You've just admitted to
being a pathological liar.

34:01.508 --> 34:02.717
Clair?

34:04.386 --> 34:05.387
Emma?

34:08.473 --> 34:09.641
Trendy guy?

34:10.976 --> 34:11.976
Yeah.

34:12.060 --> 34:15.647
Then let's go pay her a visit.

34:15.730 --> 34:17.107
<i>So he's dead?</i>

34:17.190 --> 34:19.275
You don't have to
worry about Kilgrave anymore.

34:19.359 --> 34:21.152
<i>Because you killed him?</i>

34:21.235 --> 34:24.572
Hope, you'll be free tomorrow.
Just think about that.

34:24.656 --> 34:27.242
- I still can't believe it.
<i>- Believe it.</i>

34:27.324 --> 34:30.203
I'm gonna pick you up tomorrow,
take you to a great restaurant.

34:30.286 --> 34:31.704
A 5 Napkin Burger.

34:33.081 --> 34:34.081
Perfect.

34:35.250 --> 34:38.253
And then I'll take you to the
airport and you'll fly home.

34:38.335 --> 34:39.837
I don't have a home.

34:40.880 --> 34:42.715
They all blame me.

34:42.799 --> 34:46.094
<i>They even told my brother
that I was dead.</i>

34:46.178 --> 34:48.179
Hope, think about the big picture.

34:49.181 --> 34:51.599
You're healthy. You're sane.

34:51.683 --> 34:53.351
That's true.

34:53.435 --> 34:57.522
Sanity was touch and
go for a while there.

34:58.231 --> 35:00.775
And you're gonna be free
in a matter of hours.

35:01.526 --> 35:02.777
<i>Big picture.</i>

35:04.654 --> 35:05.780
I'll see you tomorrow.

35:05.863 --> 35:07.074
Don't be late.

35:07.157 --> 35:08.533
<i>Not a chance.</i>

35:13.705 --> 35:16.333
Jessica? Open up, quick!

35:23.048 --> 35:24.757
- I made a terrible mistake.
- Go, go, go!

35:24.841 --> 35:25.842
Robyn knows.

35:28.886 --> 35:31.639
- What did you do, you told her?
- No, not intentionally.

35:31.723 --> 35:32.724
Get off...

35:37.312 --> 35:39.314
You killed Ruben, you bitch!

35:39.397 --> 35:41.942
What the hell are you guys doing?
This is insanity!

35:47.655 --> 35:48.781
Ruben?

35:56.039 --> 35:57.374
Ruben?

35:59.792 --> 36:00.918
She has a captive!

36:02.212 --> 36:03.671
You're gonna be okay.

36:05.548 --> 36:07.675
Oh, it's okay.

36:08.969 --> 36:11.763
You're gonna be fine.

36:14.682 --> 36:16.476
Just one single drop.

36:16.559 --> 36:18.728
More than that, you'll
destroy all our work.

36:19.729 --> 36:20.855
Okay.

36:25.777 --> 36:27.404
Hey. Eyes here.

36:30.365 --> 36:32.742
The virus will wear off
in a couple hours.

36:33.410 --> 36:35.412
Okay?

36:42.377 --> 36:43.461
Who is it?

36:44.087 --> 36:45.088
It's me.

36:47.174 --> 36:48.300
Trish?

36:52.970 --> 36:55.015
What are you doing here?

36:55.098 --> 36:58.268
How are you even standing?
You were in the hospital.

36:58.351 --> 37:00.770
No, I'm okay. Kozlov's a great doctor.

37:01.896 --> 37:04.482
Your pupils are dilated.

37:04.566 --> 37:06.693
Yeah, that's because I'm on meds.

37:07.694 --> 37:09.696
Well, I did almost die, after all.

37:10.530 --> 37:12.490
- What kind of meds?
- It doesn't matter.

37:12.574 --> 37:14.284
And, you know, I feel
much better than I look.

37:15.493 --> 37:18.163
Trish, if you're making a
vaccine, then I wanna help.

37:18.246 --> 37:20.540
Detective Clemons told me.

37:21.749 --> 37:24.627
What happened to you? You the scientist?
I'm Simpson.

37:24.711 --> 37:25.712
Why is he restrained?

37:25.795 --> 37:27.422
Kilgrave told him to cut out his heart.

37:27.505 --> 37:29.132
You think you
can make a vaccine?

37:29.216 --> 37:31.426
It turns out Kilgrave is a virus.

37:31.509 --> 37:34.054
Quite literally. That's
how he controls people.

37:35.472 --> 37:37.099
He's British.

37:37.932 --> 37:40.518
Why is a foreign scientist
holed up in a dump like this?

37:40.602 --> 37:41.603
Simpson, stop it.

37:43.813 --> 37:46.608
What makes you so sure that
you can make this vaccine?

37:47.859 --> 37:49.527
You know something
special about Kilgrave?

37:49.611 --> 37:51.404
- Don't answer that.
- He's my son.

37:51.988 --> 37:54.366
No! Don't...

37:54.449 --> 37:56.201
- You made him.
- ...hurt him.

37:57.494 --> 37:58.995
Oh, God, I'm so, so sorry.

37:59.079 --> 38:00.330
What is wrong with you?

38:00.413 --> 38:02.249
- I didn't mean to.
- They've messed you up.

38:02.332 --> 38:04.959
- You're messed up in the head! Get out!
- No!

38:05.042 --> 38:06.128
No, it won't happen again.

38:06.211 --> 38:08.213
It won't happen again
because you're leaving.

38:08.880 --> 38:09.964
Go!

38:33.363 --> 38:34.614
Oh, shit.

38:43.039 --> 38:44.249
Yeah?

38:44.332 --> 38:45.625
<i>Where are you?</i>

38:47.294 --> 38:48.295
What time is it?

38:48.378 --> 38:50.922
<i>You said that you'd be
here when I got out.</i>

38:52.424 --> 38:54.008
- Don't move.
- Why?

38:54.091 --> 38:56.178
<i>Lock yourself in the
bathroom if you have to.</i>

38:56.261 --> 38:57.512
He's alive, isn't he?

38:57.595 --> 38:59.222
<i>He's still out there.</i>

38:59.306 --> 39:00.390
Don't move!

39:12.152 --> 39:14.070
Hi, I'm here to pick up an inmate.

39:14.154 --> 39:16.198
Former inmate. She was
getting released today.

39:16.281 --> 39:17.699
- Name?
- Jessica Jones.

39:17.782 --> 39:20.117
No, sorry, that's my name.

39:20.202 --> 39:21.744
Her name is Hope. Hope Shlottman.

39:21.828 --> 39:23.955
Shlottman was released 20 minutes ago.

39:25.039 --> 39:27.124
I told her to wait for me.

39:27.209 --> 39:29.211
- Some guy picked her up.
- Jessica Jones?

39:31.171 --> 39:33.089
- Yeah?
- He's at your favorite restaurant.

39:33.173 --> 39:35.550
He said to bring Dad or lose all hope.

39:43.850 --> 39:45.518
I know what people look like on speed.

39:45.602 --> 39:46.894
This is...

39:46.978 --> 39:48.688
There's more to this.

39:48.771 --> 39:51.483
Simpson was so intense,
focused, and he's wounded,

39:51.566 --> 39:53.025
but not feeling it.

39:53.943 --> 39:57.197
Probably some kind of combat
enhancement for wakefulness.

39:58.240 --> 39:59.866
To numb the pain center,

39:59.949 --> 40:03.411
push the adrenergic system
for strength and stamina.

40:03.495 --> 40:05.538
He's part of a private
research program.

40:05.622 --> 40:07.707
Unregulated, no doubt.

40:07.790 --> 40:10.252
You can grow someone's
strength or power,

40:10.335 --> 40:12.044
but you can't grow a
corresponding conscience.

40:12.128 --> 40:13.546
There's no pill for that.

40:17.634 --> 40:19.176
Open the door.

40:22.430 --> 40:23.681
Tell me you have the vaccine.

40:23.765 --> 40:26.351
I do, but there's only
one way to test it.

40:26.434 --> 40:27.727
He took Hope.

40:27.810 --> 40:29.229
What?

40:29.312 --> 40:31.356
He'll trade her for you.

40:35.902 --> 40:38.070
He'll have
contingencies in place.

40:38.154 --> 40:41.073
People ready to stab
themselves or something.

40:41.157 --> 40:42.700
I'm trembling.

40:42.784 --> 40:44.744
My God, I'm such a coward.

40:45.662 --> 40:47.539
You're not a coward, okay?

40:47.622 --> 40:49.541
I want you to know, right
here and right now

40:49.624 --> 40:51.376
that you are not a coward.

41:16.025 --> 41:18.903
You can't say these stroppy
tosspots don't deserve it.

41:33.167 --> 41:35.920
Your father is here.
Now give me the girl.

41:36.003 --> 41:37.422
Step forward.

41:39.424 --> 41:40.633
Stop this!

41:40.717 --> 41:42.719
Don't bark orders at me.

41:42.802 --> 41:44.178
Say you're sorry.

41:45.472 --> 41:48.850
I'm sorry.

41:49.601 --> 41:50.768
About hitting me.

41:53.938 --> 41:56.358
Yes. All of it.

41:59.652 --> 42:00.737
Stay.

42:07.910 --> 42:10.037
See? I still have all the control.

42:10.121 --> 42:12.289
Jessica. Kill him now.

42:13.290 --> 42:14.584
We had a deal.

42:15.209 --> 42:17.462
"Abandon hope,
all ye who enter here."

42:18.755 --> 42:21.298
That's the words written
on the doorway to hell.

42:21.383 --> 42:23.468
Kill him or he'll keep hurting people!

42:23.551 --> 42:25.637
- Let me handle this.
- She'll never kill me.

42:25.720 --> 42:28.473
Despite her calloused, hard-bitten,

42:28.556 --> 42:30.725
and, frankly, poorly styled facade,

42:30.808 --> 42:32.977
despite her several problems,

42:33.060 --> 42:37.815
she still hopes that, at her
core, she might just be a hero.

42:40.109 --> 42:42.319
But only if she can save you.

42:43.696 --> 42:45.532
The ultimate innocent victim.

42:48.993 --> 42:50.787
Father, come here.

42:55.625 --> 42:56.793
Now!

43:04.509 --> 43:06.052
I'm sorry.

43:06.135 --> 43:08.054
That's nice, Dad.
Nice and close.

43:10.682 --> 43:13.435
Aw, look at you trembling there.

43:13.518 --> 43:15.437
Still spineless, I see.

43:21.859 --> 43:24.529
It's just
you and me now, Dad.

43:26.113 --> 43:28.700
You can't kill me, silly girl.

43:29.701 --> 43:31.118
But Jessica can.

43:31.202 --> 43:32.328
What are you doing?

43:33.621 --> 43:34.831
Step forward!

43:57.437 --> 43:58.730
Hope!

43:59.689 --> 44:01.273
Hope, why would you do this?

44:01.357 --> 44:03.735
You can kill him now.

44:03.818 --> 44:05.152
Hope.

44:05.236 --> 44:06.571
Tell me.

44:06.654 --> 44:08.155
Tell me!

44:12.368 --> 44:13.620
