00:50.200 --> 00:52.350
Pretty nice up here, isn't it?

00:52.440 --> 00:54.351
- Kermit?
- Huh?

00:54.440 --> 00:57.159
What if we drift out to sea?

00:57.240 --> 01:00.869
What if we're never heard from again?
What if there's a storm?

01:00.960 --> 01:04.953
- Or we get struck by lightning?
- That'd be neat.

01:05.040 --> 01:08.794
Listen, nothing's gonna happen.
This is just the opening credits.

01:08.880 --> 01:11.553
Oh. Where are they?

01:12.560 --> 01:14.551
Wow!

01:14.640 --> 01:19.031
- <i>"The Great Muppet Caper."</i>
- Nice title.

01:19.880 --> 01:21.108
Whoo-wee!

01:21.200 --> 01:23.794
I'd like to try this without the balloon.

01:23.880 --> 01:26.758
- Try what? Plummeting?
- Yeah!

01:26.840 --> 01:29.593
I suppose you could try it once.

01:29.680 --> 01:31.636
- Kermit?
- Mm?

01:31.720 --> 01:34.280
How long are these opening credits?

01:34.360 --> 01:37.158
Just about another minute or so.

01:37.240 --> 01:39.231
My ears are popping.

01:40.120 --> 01:43.476
I wonder how far you
could plummet before you blacked out.

01:43.560 --> 01:46.757
Well, don't try it, Gonzo.
We need you for this movie.

01:46.840 --> 01:49.354
Sure is tempting.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.035
- Kermit?
- Huh?

01:54.120 --> 01:56.998
What does "BSC" stand for?

01:57.080 --> 01:59.594
I don't know.

02:03.480 --> 02:06.677
Gee, a lot of people worked on this movie.

02:06.760 --> 02:10.229
This is nothing.
Wait till you see the end credits.

02:18.320 --> 02:19.639
- Kermit?
- Mm?

02:19.720 --> 02:22.678
- Are the credits over?
- Not quite.

02:25.120 --> 02:27.190
Nobody reads those names
anyway, do they?

02:27.280 --> 02:30.511
Sure. They all have families.

02:30.600 --> 02:31.555
Ah.

02:31.640 --> 02:33.835
That's it. The sky is clear.

02:33.920 --> 02:37.754
So, OK. Well, now what do we do?
I mean, how does this movie start?

02:37.840 --> 02:41.071
- Well, we just pull that rope.
- Yes, sir!

02:44.960 --> 02:47.952
We're going down!

02:48.040 --> 02:50.349
Heads up, below!

03:02.600 --> 03:05.194
What a fantastic beginning.

03:07.560 --> 03:10.632
<i>There'll be spectacle</i>
<i>There'll be fantasy</i>

03:10.720 --> 03:14.190
<i>There'll be derring-do</i>
<i>and stuff like you have never seen</i>

03:14.280 --> 03:17.636
- <i>Hey. A movie</i>
- <i>Yeah. We're gonna be a movie</i>

03:17.720 --> 03:20.678
- <i>Starring everybody</i>
- <i>And me</i>

03:20.760 --> 03:24.196
<i>There'll be heroes bold</i>
<i>There'll be comedy</i>

03:24.280 --> 03:27.511
<i>And a lot of fuss</i>
<i>that ends for us real happily</i>

03:27.600 --> 03:31.036
- <i>Hey. A movie</i>
- <i>We can watch it all develop</i>

03:31.120 --> 03:34.112
- <i>Starring everybody</i>
- <i>And me</i>

03:34.200 --> 03:37.556
<i>We'll take the world</i>
<i>and set it on its ear</i>

03:37.640 --> 03:41.758
<i>Come on. Join in</i>
<i>We're gonna start right here</i>

03:45.840 --> 03:47.910
It's OK. I landed on my head.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.991
Come on!

03:50.080 --> 03:51.672
Here, chicken!

03:51.760 --> 03:54.991
Hey! Why, you...

03:55.080 --> 03:56.638
Whoa!

03:56.720 --> 04:00.190
Hold it!

04:00.280 --> 04:03.352
- Go ahead, Kermit.
- Thank you. See, in this film,

04:03.440 --> 04:07.035
me and Fozzie play crack investigative
reporters for <i>The Daily Chronicle.</i>

04:07.120 --> 04:10.192
And Gonzo, he's our photographer.
And it's gonna be terrific.

04:12.560 --> 04:15.393
Boy, I wish I were you people,
seeing this for the first time.

04:15.480 --> 04:17.516
Wh?

04:19.399 --> 04:22.517
- <i>There'll be crooks and cops</i>
- <i>There'll be villainy</i>

04:22.600 --> 04:25.797
<i>But with us on call</i>
<i>we'll fix it all real easily</i>

04:25.880 --> 04:29.509
- <i>Hey. A movie</i>
- <i>Wow. It's gonna be terrific</i>

04:29.600 --> 04:32.990
- <i>Starring everybody</i>
- And me.

04:33.080 --> 04:35.150
Argh!

04:36.200 --> 04:38.555
Now, what we need, guys,
is an exciting photo story.

04:38.640 --> 04:42.553
Right this way, young lady.
I'll take a picture of this chicken.

04:43.640 --> 04:45.392
- Beautiful.
- That's great, Gonzo.

04:45.480 --> 04:48.074
Yeah. Smile, chicky babe.

04:53.920 --> 04:56.957
My jewels! That man stole my jewels!

04:57.040 --> 04:59.429
Help! My jewels!

05:07.800 --> 05:11.270
Look up. Hey, do you wanna
make the front pages or not?

05:11.360 --> 05:13.237
Kermit, I got a great picture of the chicken.

05:13.320 --> 05:14.150
Oh, good.

05:14.240 --> 05:17.630
<i>There'll be mystery and catastrophe</i>

05:17.720 --> 05:21.156
<i>But it's all in fun</i>
<i>You paid the money. Wait and see</i>

05:21.240 --> 05:24.835
- <i>Hey. A movie</i>
- <i>Is there any way to stop it?</i>

05:24.920 --> 05:28.469
- <i>Starring everybody</i>
- <i>Everybody</i>

05:28.560 --> 05:31.393
- <i>Everybody and</i>
- <i>Oh...</i>

05:35.120 --> 05:37.270
<i>Me</i>

05:43.280 --> 05:46.352
How could you miss a story like that?

05:47.280 --> 05:50.397
It was right under your noses,
practically bit you on the seat of the pants.

05:50.480 --> 05:51.799
There's just no excuse.

05:51.880 --> 05:54.952
I guess this would be the wrong time
to ask for a raise?

05:55.400 --> 05:58.073
Raise? A raise?

05:59.040 --> 06:01.395
I'll give you a raise!

06:02.440 --> 06:05.159
Did you read these headlines? Huh?

06:05.240 --> 06:09.028
"Jewel heist on Main Street."
And it's nice bold print, isn't it?

06:09.120 --> 06:11.111
- Yes, it's very easy to read.
- Mm.

06:11.920 --> 06:13.956
- Shut up now.
- Sorry.

06:14.040 --> 06:17.191
"Lady Holiday's Jewels Stolen",
that's what it says in the <i>Times.</i>

06:17.280 --> 06:22.400
And here's the <i>Herald.</i>
"Fashion Queen of London Robbed."

06:22.480 --> 06:25.438
And last but not least...

06:26.320 --> 06:28.914
...here's our cute little banner story.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.912
"Identical Twins Join the <i>Chronicle</i> Staff."

06:32.000 --> 06:34.468
Now, I ask you,
what paper would you buy?

06:35.200 --> 06:37.873
- I read the one that has "Dear Abby".
- Bah!

06:42.160 --> 06:45.357
Gee, Mr Tarkanian. We thought identical
twins working on a newspaper

06:45.440 --> 06:47.829
- would make an interesting story.
- Yeah.

06:47.920 --> 06:53.313
Well, it doesn't. Especially since
you two guys don't look anything alike.

06:53.400 --> 06:56.278
Well, that's cos Fozzie's not wearing
his hat. Fozzie, put your hat back on.

06:56.360 --> 06:59.432
Oh. Yes, sir. See?

07:00.040 --> 07:02.190
Oh, yeah.

07:02.280 --> 07:05.909
I can see it now. But that's still
no excuse for blowing a story.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.834
- We'll do better next time.
- Next time? Next time?

07:09.920 --> 07:12.150
What makes you think
there's gonna be a next time?

07:12.240 --> 07:14.435
Well, if there isn't
it's gonna be a real short movie.

07:14.520 --> 07:16.112
Look, the only reason I hired you two jerks

07:16.200 --> 07:19.033
was because your old man
was a friend of mine.

07:19.600 --> 07:21.431
Dad spoke well of you too.

07:21.520 --> 07:25.672
Well, I'm as sentimental as the next guy.
That's why I don't want him to hear this.

07:25.760 --> 07:28.035
You're fired.

07:28.120 --> 07:31.715
- Take that thing down off the ceiling.
- Yeah, but, Mr Tarkanian...

07:31.800 --> 07:34.439
- Gonzo.
- Check. Whoo-wee!

07:34.520 --> 07:35.919
Won't you listen to reason, sir?

07:36.000 --> 07:39.072
I'm not listening to anything
and I'm not giving you your job back.

07:39.160 --> 07:41.879
I don't want you to give us anything.
We just want to go to England

07:41.960 --> 07:44.190
and talk to Lady Holiday -
the woman who was robbed?

07:44.280 --> 07:46.316
And we'll catch those jewel thieves for you.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.709
You see, all you have to do
is pay our way to London.

07:48.800 --> 07:49.630
Oh!

07:49.720 --> 07:52.473
Is that all I have to do?

07:52.560 --> 07:54.596
Well, we could use
some new luggage for the trip.

07:54.680 --> 07:56.318
Luggage?

07:56.400 --> 07:59.949
- Now look, beat it. I got a deadline to meet.
- But how are we gonna get to London?

08:00.040 --> 08:04.397
I'll tell you what, Fozzie, since you're such
an investigative reporter, you figure it out.

08:04.480 --> 08:08.598
- I'm Fozzie.
- Oh, yeah, yeah. The hat.

08:11.840 --> 08:14.752
Stop the presses!

08:15.480 --> 08:17.277
Why? What happened?

08:17.360 --> 08:19.874
I don't know.
I've always wanted to say that.

08:19.960 --> 08:22.190
Look, you guys...

08:36.159 --> 08:39.197
Oh, boy.
It must be 50 below in here.

08:39.280 --> 08:41.236
You're lucky, you have fur.

08:41.320 --> 08:46.997
No, no, no. You're the one with the fur.
Turn on your light and see for yourself.

08:47.080 --> 08:48.672
Oh, yeah!

08:48.760 --> 08:50.796
I keep mixing us up.

08:51.760 --> 08:54.957
I think I'll read for a while.

08:55.920 --> 08:58.798
- I wish I had a book.
- Hey, Kermit?

08:58.880 --> 09:01.758
Can you reach the hostess call button?
I'm hungry.

09:01.840 --> 09:04.434
They don't serve food in ninth class.

09:04.520 --> 09:07.751
What?
$12 and you don't even get a meal?

09:08.200 --> 09:13.399
Hey, could you guys keep it down?
I'm trying to watch the movie.

09:14.280 --> 09:17.477
- Hey, somebody's coming.
- Maybe they're bringing hamburgers.

09:17.560 --> 09:20.950
- All out for England!
- Oh, great, the plane is landing.

09:21.040 --> 09:25.238
- The plane? Nah, the plane lands in Italy.
- Huh?

09:25.320 --> 09:27.788
- You land in England.
- Whoa!

09:28.840 --> 09:31.035
Kermmmmiiitt!

09:33.200 --> 09:35.111
What's happening?

09:35.200 --> 09:37.919
Whoopee!

09:41.080 --> 09:43.878
Geronimo!

09:49.760 --> 09:52.228
Glug!

09:52.320 --> 09:54.356
For once the forecast was right.

09:54.440 --> 09:57.113
It said it was going to rain cats and dogs.

09:57.200 --> 10:00.431
- No, no. We're bears and frogs.
- And Gonzos.

10:00.520 --> 10:04.115
Whatever you are, whoever you are,
welcome to Great Britain.

10:04.200 --> 10:06.395
Great Britain?
We're actually in Great Britain!

10:06.480 --> 10:09.631
Oh, no, we'll never get to England now.

10:09.720 --> 10:12.439
You are in England, my furry friend.

10:12.520 --> 10:16.035
This 'sceptred isle.
This jewel of the North Atlantic.

10:16.120 --> 10:17.917
Oh, good. Well, we're going to London

10:18.000 --> 10:20.673
and we were wondering
if you could recommend a nice hotel.

10:20.760 --> 10:23.433
- Actually, a cheap hotel.
- How cheap?

10:23.960 --> 10:28.988
- Free.
- That narrows the field a bit. Let's see.

10:29.080 --> 10:32.197
"Places where you can park
your carcasses."

10:32.280 --> 10:34.555
Bus terminals. River banks.

10:34.640 --> 10:38.269
- The Happiness Hotel.
- Happiness Hotel? That sounds great.

10:38.360 --> 10:41.591
What's wrong with bus terminals?

10:41.680 --> 10:43.875
Well, thanks a lot for your help, sir.

10:52.560 --> 10:54.073
Hey, guys, this is London.

10:54.160 --> 10:56.879
Yeah, London!
We made it! Oh, boy!

10:56.960 --> 10:58.757
- Is that the Eiffel Tower?
- Yeah!

10:58.840 --> 11:00.831
- No.
- No, no.

11:01.720 --> 11:03.312
- Hey, Kermit?
- Yeah?

11:03.400 --> 11:06.358
- Are bears allowed in those fountains?
- What?

11:06.440 --> 11:08.158
Are bears allowed in those fountains?

11:08.240 --> 11:10.151
- No, I don't think so.
- I need a bath.

11:11.320 --> 11:15.359
This is terrific.
Wow, look at the scenery.

11:15.440 --> 11:19.069
It's very realistic.
Hey, what's the name of this river?

11:19.160 --> 11:22.072
- I don't know.
- I think it's the English River.

11:22.160 --> 11:23.434
Oh.

11:23.520 --> 11:26.751
I'll take a picture of it.
Say cheese!

11:27.720 --> 11:29.199
Did I get my elbow in the shot?

11:29.280 --> 11:32.556
- Don't worry. It adds human interest.
- But I'm a bear.

11:32.640 --> 11:35.473
- Anyone for the Happiness Hotel?
- Huh?

11:35.560 --> 11:37.516
- Oh, Happiness Hotel!
- That's us!

11:37.600 --> 11:40.034
- Yes, we want the Happiness Hotel.
- Yeah.

11:42.360 --> 11:43.998
Argh!

11:45.480 --> 11:48.074
Wow.

11:48.160 --> 11:50.674
Boy, another crash landing.
That was terrible.

11:50.760 --> 11:52.990
Well, we'll just have to do it again.

11:53.080 --> 11:57.471
Oh, look. The Happiness Hotel.
What do you think, guys?

11:57.560 --> 11:58.515
Wow.

11:58.600 --> 12:02.991
If that's the Happiness Hotel
I'd hate to see what the sad one looks like.

12:16.880 --> 12:19.519
- Excuse me?
- What?

12:19.600 --> 12:21.909
We'd like a room.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.911
Really?

12:24.000 --> 12:26.639
Yeah, we'd like to check in.

12:26.720 --> 12:29.951
Somebody's checking in!

12:30.040 --> 12:32.429
Somebody's checking in?

12:34.480 --> 12:38.439
<i>Oh. There's no fire in the fireplace</i>
<i>There's no carpet on the floor</i>

12:38.520 --> 12:41.956
<i>Don't try to order dinner</i>
<i>There's no kitchen any more</i>

12:42.040 --> 12:45.237
<i>But if the road's been kinda bumpy</i>
<i>and you need to rest a spell</i>

12:45.320 --> 12:48.551
<i>Well. Welcome home</i>
<i>to the Happiness Hotel</i>

12:53.840 --> 12:57.150
- Hey, how are you guys fixing to pay?
- What are our choices?

12:57.240 --> 13:00.232
A, credit card. B, cash.

13:00.320 --> 13:02.880
C, sneak out in the middle of the night.

13:03.480 --> 13:05.038
We'll take C.

13:05.120 --> 13:07.759
Very popular choice.

13:10.520 --> 13:14.149
<i>If you got luggage keep it handy</i>
<i>but you're running out of luck</i>

13:14.240 --> 13:17.789
<i>Cos the bellhops ain't too organised</i>
<i>and the elevator's stuck</i>

13:17.880 --> 13:20.838
<i>Still if you don't mind friendly animals</i>
<i>and can learn to stand the smell</i>

13:20.920 --> 13:24.549
<i>Well. Welcome home</i>
<i>to the Happiness Hotel</i>

13:30.560 --> 13:33.074
You know, I may be mistaken,
but the bellhops look like rats.

13:33.160 --> 13:35.435
You should see the chambermaids.

13:47.080 --> 13:48.718
- <i>Welcome home</i>
- <i>Welcome home</i>

13:48.960 --> 13:50.791
- <i>Welcome home</i>
- <i>Welcome home</i>

13:50.880 --> 13:54.111
<i>No matter where you wander</i>
<i>you will never do as well</i>

13:59.200 --> 14:02.795
<i>OK. The lobby's looking shabby</i>
<i>and it's got the wrong address</i>

14:02.880 --> 14:06.236
<i>And the whole dang thing has</i>
<i>been condemned by American Express</i>

14:06.320 --> 14:09.517
<i>Still the management is cheerful</i>
<i>though the whole joint's gone to hell</i>

14:09.600 --> 14:13.991
<i>Well. Welcome home</i>
<i>to the Happiness Hotel</i>

14:14.640 --> 14:17.234
- You guys live here?
- Yeah, but only between gigs.

14:17.320 --> 14:20.710
So that means we've been here this time,
what, five years?

14:20.800 --> 14:24.952
Yeah, but, like, OK, you know, our agent,
you know, like, he says, I mean, like,

14:25.040 --> 14:28.555
things are really going to break
as soon as we get our new glossies.

14:29.080 --> 14:31.196
Argh!

14:31.280 --> 14:33.316
What's wrong with the drummer?
He looks a little crazed.

14:33.400 --> 14:37.075
Aw, he's just upset about missing the
Rembrandt exhibit at the National Gallery.

14:37.160 --> 14:39.628
Renoir!

15:16.080 --> 15:17.798
- <i>Oh. There are bugs</i>
- <i>There are bugs</i>

15:17.880 --> 15:19.836
- <i>And there are lice</i>
- <i>There are lice</i>

15:19.920 --> 15:23.356
Sure, we have our little problems
but you'll never beat the price

15:23.440 --> 15:26.796
- <i>You got every kind of critter</i>
- <i>You got every kind of pest</i>

15:26.880 --> 15:30.395
But we treat 'em all as equals
just like any other guest

15:30.480 --> 15:33.631
Though you're cleaner than the others
still, as far as we can tell

15:33.720 --> 15:36.792
You'll fit right in to the Happiness Hotel

15:36.880 --> 15:42.352
We'll fit right in to the Happiness Hotel

15:42.440 --> 15:45.193
Say cheese!

15:48.800 --> 15:51.394
You are all weirdos.

15:52.320 --> 15:53.275
Ugh.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.516
Oh, that's just fine right there.

15:58.800 --> 16:00.836
Thank you.

16:01.800 --> 16:04.360
Hey, not bad.

16:04.440 --> 16:07.238
Are you sure we can afford this?

16:07.320 --> 16:09.311
Hey, Kermit, I'm getting hungry.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.595
- Call room service.
- There's no phone.

16:11.680 --> 16:15.514
- That's OK. There's no food either.
- Come on, Rizzo.

16:15.600 --> 16:18.273
Look, why don't we forget about food
and get a good night's sleep?

16:18.360 --> 16:21.909
We have to get up early
to interview Lady Holiday.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.232
Boy, I sure could use something
from one or more of the basic food groups.

16:26.720 --> 16:30.395
We'll have breakfast in the morning.
Right now, let's just be thankful we're here.

16:33.920 --> 16:35.353
Say, this is nice.

16:35.440 --> 16:37.795
Can somebody
turn out the light?

16:38.800 --> 16:39.471
Thank you.

16:42.200 --> 16:47.479
This is Lady Holiday.
Milan speaking? Then put him on.

16:47.560 --> 16:49.869
Oh, yes, darling. Yes, I'm fine.

16:49.960 --> 16:53.509
I had quite a scare.
Thank God I wasn't hurt.

16:53.600 --> 16:58.355
Of course my diamonds were valuable.
All my diamonds are valuable.

16:58.440 --> 17:00.749
Now, darling, I want you
to call the United States and tell <i>Vogue</i>

17:00.840 --> 17:03.354
they can't have the photographs
of the spring line until after the show.

17:03.440 --> 17:09.196
I'm not too happy with some of the designs.
Still have to make some changes.

17:14.960 --> 17:18.839
Well, I'm looking at three of the gowns now
and I can see horrendous mistakes.

17:18.920 --> 17:21.275
Of course Paris should be notified.

17:21.359 --> 17:24.636
Carla. The neckline on that gown
is too high, don't you think?

17:24.720 --> 17:26.915
- I rather like the effect.
- Do you like looking like an ostrich?

17:27.000 --> 17:29.116
- Of course not.
- And Marla.

17:29.200 --> 17:30.918
Too many frills and furbelows.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.231
I don't think we should strive
for the fantail pigeon look, do you?

17:34.320 --> 17:37.869
And you, Darla. That outfit's the pits.

17:37.960 --> 17:39.951
Loose where it should be tight
and tight where it should be loose,

17:40.040 --> 17:41.234
like the folds on a turkey's neck.

17:41.320 --> 17:45.916
Why would I design
such atrocious-looking clothes? Oh!

17:46.000 --> 17:49.276
- I must be getting senile.
- <i>Yes. Lady Holiday?</i>

17:49.360 --> 17:52.238
We have to make drastic changes
in the new line before the show tomorrow.

17:52.320 --> 17:56.313
All my girls are going around
looking like barnyard animals.

17:58.600 --> 18:01.160
Good heavens. Who are you?

18:04.320 --> 18:10.236
My name is Miss Piggy and
I would like to be a high-fashion model.

18:11.240 --> 18:14.391
Doesn't surprise me.
Seems to be the way we're heading.

18:14.480 --> 18:18.314
I've always dreamed
of being a Holiday model.

18:18.400 --> 18:22.313
I have brought my <i>je ne sais quoi</i> and
my portfolio all the way here to London

18:22.400 --> 18:26.598
to see you, the one and only Lady Holiday.

18:27.840 --> 18:30.354
- May I come in?
- Absolutely not.

18:31.400 --> 18:33.391
- May I show you my portfolio?
- No.

18:33.480 --> 18:36.836
Good. Here. You may open it.

18:37.280 --> 18:37.917
Ah.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.197
This is me reeking grandeur.

18:41.280 --> 18:43.953
Being aloof.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.600
Being demure. Ah.

18:46.680 --> 18:48.352
Daring.

18:48.440 --> 18:52.035
- Interesting range of emotions.
- You think so?

18:52.120 --> 18:56.557
Well, as you can see from
this small sampling, modelling is my life.

18:56.640 --> 18:59.313
It is my destiny. I shall accept nothing less.

18:59.400 --> 19:02.870
I can offer you a job as a receptionist.

19:02.960 --> 19:06.748
I'll take it! I'll take it!
Oh, thank you, thank you! Thank you!

19:06.840 --> 19:08.478
Oh! Oh! Oh!

19:08.560 --> 19:13.588
You won't be sorry, I promise. I can type,
I can take shorthand, I can make coffee.

19:13.680 --> 19:16.638
- I can do it all.
- Sit.

19:16.720 --> 19:20.315
- I can sit. I'm very good at sitting.
- Are you quite under control?

19:20.400 --> 19:22.755
Mm, mm, mm, mm!

19:23.480 --> 19:25.994
Now, I'll be lunching with my brother Nicky.

19:26.080 --> 19:29.436
He's second in command here
and he's an irresponsible parasite.

19:29.520 --> 19:31.192
But I had to bring him into the business

19:31.280 --> 19:33.236
because he squandered
his half of the inheritance

19:33.320 --> 19:36.790
and he has categorically no prospects.
Not that he's grateful.

19:36.880 --> 19:39.838
He still gambles and incurs bad debts,
uses my charge accounts,

19:39.920 --> 19:43.595
eats my food and borrows my cars
without asking permission.

19:43.680 --> 19:46.194
And certainly he's not to be trusted.

19:46.280 --> 19:49.511
I wouldn't even put it past him to try to steal
my most valuable and largest jewel,

19:49.600 --> 19:51.750
the fabulous Baseball Diamond.

19:51.840 --> 19:56.072
And I don't know why his bow ties
are always crooked.

19:56.160 --> 20:00.312
- Still, in all, he is my brother.
- Why are you telling me all this?

20:00.400 --> 20:02.356
It's plot exposition. It has to go somewhere.

20:02.440 --> 20:05.477
Anyway, I want you
to answer the telephone while I'm gone

20:05.560 --> 20:07.676
and straighten up the office.

20:07.760 --> 20:09.716
Consider it done.

20:10.640 --> 20:13.359
Everything's under control. Not to sweat.

20:14.320 --> 20:17.278
Carry on. I'll be back in an hour.

20:18.720 --> 20:19.630
Whee!

20:19.720 --> 20:21.836
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!

20:21.920 --> 20:25.595
Oh, I am going to be a famous model.
Oh, I'm so happy for me.

20:25.680 --> 20:29.559
Miss Piggy, you are on your way.

20:29.640 --> 20:32.359
Where does Lady Holiday get off
calling me an ostrich?

20:32.440 --> 20:35.796
We'll get even with Lady Holiday tonight
when we steal her necklace.

20:35.880 --> 20:39.395
What are you going to wear
for the robbery?

20:40.240 --> 20:41.434
Hi.

20:41.520 --> 20:45.308
- Hi. Hello.
- Hubba hubba!

20:45.400 --> 20:47.755
Excuse me, where's Lady Holiday's office?

20:47.840 --> 20:50.195
- Round the corner, to the left.
- Oh. Thank you.

20:50.280 --> 20:52.874
- Did you just give directions to a frog?
- I guess I did.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.520
Smile.

20:55.600 --> 20:57.670
Is that a new photographer?

20:57.760 --> 20:59.512
Urgh!

21:00.800 --> 21:04.236
- I think I'm stuck.
- Gonzo? Gonzo!

21:04.320 --> 21:06.276
Gonzo. Gonzo.

21:06.360 --> 21:08.351
Pull.

21:10.640 --> 21:14.599
- Gonzo, are you OK?
- Oh, sure. It was just my nose.

21:14.680 --> 21:17.274
Hey, you guys stay here.
I'll find Lady Holiday.

21:17.360 --> 21:17.951
Yes, sir.

21:18.040 --> 21:22.795
Hey, Fozzie. Come on,
get your nose in here. It's really fun.

21:27.840 --> 21:30.832
Mr Holiday? Did you order
a gross of flowered socks?

21:31.240 --> 21:34.596
Oh! What an honour.
You're all so wonderful.

21:34.680 --> 21:38.309
Thank you for choosing <i>moi</i>
as model of the year.

21:38.400 --> 21:42.439
Oh! I never dreamed
when I first began in this business

21:42.520 --> 21:45.080
that I would reach such lofty heights.

21:45.160 --> 21:47.355
Thank you! Thank you!

21:47.440 --> 21:49.715
Excuse me.

21:51.680 --> 21:54.240
So, what do you think
about the drapes, hm?

21:54.320 --> 21:56.959
Personally, I'd rather see shutters. Yes.

21:57.440 --> 21:59.749
And on this wall here...

22:13.200 --> 22:15.430
Lady Holiday?

22:17.200 --> 22:19.316
Lady Holiday?

22:30.840 --> 22:32.831
Gee, are you OK?

22:32.920 --> 22:36.230
I don't think I'll ever be the same.

22:36.320 --> 22:38.754
- Pardon?
- Oh.

22:38.840 --> 22:41.274
I mean, I don't usually fall like that.

22:41.360 --> 22:44.875
I thought it was a very nice fall.
It was quite graceful, actually.

22:44.960 --> 22:48.350
Oh, thank you, whoever you are.

22:48.440 --> 22:50.431
My name is Kermit the Frog

22:50.520 --> 22:54.638
and I've come all the way from America
to interview you for <i>The Daily Chronicle.</i>

22:54.720 --> 22:56.870
Me? Why me?

22:56.960 --> 22:58.951
Because you're Lady Holiday.

23:00.480 --> 23:01.913
Oh. Oh.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.719
Yeah, right. Reason enough.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.552
Um...

23:06.640 --> 23:08.198
You wanna help me
out of this wastebasket?

23:08.280 --> 23:09.076
Oh.

23:09.160 --> 23:10.832
- Oh, yeah.
- Now just pull.

23:10.920 --> 23:13.673
OK.

23:13.760 --> 23:16.035
- Harder.
- OK.

23:19.840 --> 23:23.594
So... listen. Can I ask you
a couple of questions now?

23:23.680 --> 23:26.513
No, no. Um... Not here.

23:26.600 --> 23:29.478
So busy. So much to do.

23:29.560 --> 23:32.313
Well, perhaps we could
have dinner tonight?

23:32.400 --> 23:35.517
Yes. Fine. Swell. See you then.

23:35.600 --> 23:38.273
I'll pick you up at your house.
It must be beautiful.

23:38.360 --> 23:40.316
- I'm sure it is.
- Hm?

23:40.400 --> 23:43.597
- I mean, sure it is!
- Yeah.

23:43.680 --> 23:46.956
So, where do you live?

23:47.040 --> 23:48.837
Um...

23:48.920 --> 23:51.115
Guess!

23:51.200 --> 23:53.430
Probably some highbrow street
somewhere.

23:53.520 --> 23:57.559
Highbrow Street, absolutely right.
Highbrow Street.

23:57.640 --> 24:02.350
How did you guess? Are you psychic?
But now, guess what number.

24:02.440 --> 24:05.637
I don't know. Number 17?

24:05.720 --> 24:07.915
Yes, all right. 17 Highbrow Street.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.719
OK. I'll pick you up at, shall we say...

24:10.800 --> 24:12.836
- eight o'clock?
- 5:30?

24:12.920 --> 24:14.751
- 4:15?
- 9:20?

24:14.840 --> 24:17.149
- Seven o'clock.
- OK. That was easy.

24:17.240 --> 24:18.992
- Yes, easy.
- OK, well I'll see you later.

24:19.080 --> 24:21.514
Yes. Eight o'clock.

24:21.600 --> 24:23.875
- Seven.
- Seven, seven.

24:25.200 --> 24:27.031
Well, um...

24:27.120 --> 24:30.078
- Goodbye.
- Yes.

24:30.160 --> 24:32.628
Adios, <i>mon chéri.</i>

24:35.000 --> 24:36.672
Much obliged.

24:36.760 --> 24:39.957
So, Kermit, tell me, what about
Lady Holiday? I mean, is she pretty?

24:40.040 --> 24:44.591
Oh, yeah. Not at all what I expected.
Nice eyes, sturdy legs.

24:44.680 --> 24:48.593
And it might have been my imagination,
but I think she found me attractive.

24:48.680 --> 24:50.159
Oh. Taxi!

24:50.240 --> 24:53.630
Well, of course she found you attractive.
It runs in the family.

24:53.720 --> 24:56.917
Taxi! Taxi!

24:57.000 --> 25:01.710
- I don't know why the cabs won't stop.
- Just leave it to me.

25:01.800 --> 25:04.189
Taxiiii!

25:07.960 --> 25:10.190
That's very effective.

25:10.280 --> 25:12.475
Yeah, it's great when it works.

25:12.560 --> 25:16.792
- Did you want me to stop or what?
- Thank you very much, sir.

25:16.880 --> 25:19.110
Oh, you can call me Beauregard.

25:19.200 --> 25:21.998
- Where are you guys going?
- The Happiness Hotel.

25:22.080 --> 25:25.470
Oh, good, that's where I'm going.
How do you get there?

25:25.560 --> 25:28.996
- Haven't you ever been there?
- Of course. I live there.

25:29.080 --> 25:31.071
I just don't know how to get there.

25:31.160 --> 25:34.277
- It's straight down this street.
- OK.

25:38.600 --> 25:42.513
- OK. Good. Now just keep going straight.
- Will do.

25:48.040 --> 25:50.679
It takes a while to get to know the town.

25:50.760 --> 25:53.957
- How long have you lived in London?
- All my life.

25:54.040 --> 25:55.792
How come you don't have
an English accent?

25:55.880 --> 25:58.519
Hey, I'm lucky to have a driver's license.

26:07.840 --> 26:10.832
- Hey, it's just up ahead there on the right.
- What is?

26:10.920 --> 26:13.912
- The Happiness Hotel.
- Oh, yeah.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.991
What's your room number?

26:16.080 --> 26:18.230
Wh? I don't know.
We're on the second floor.

26:18.320 --> 26:22.552
Oh, I'm sorry. I can only take you
as far as the lobby.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.560
Whee!

26:39.520 --> 26:42.080
You can never find a cab
when you need one.

26:42.160 --> 26:45.038
Whoo-whee!

26:45.120 --> 26:47.918
- Can we do that again?
- Well, thank you very much, Beauregard.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.150
You're welcome.
Hey, how do I get out of here?

26:50.240 --> 26:53.277
I suggest you make a U-turn.

26:53.360 --> 26:55.920
Right.

26:58.640 --> 27:01.712
- He's headed for the kitchen!
- Oh, no!

27:13.800 --> 27:17.156
Well, looks like steering wheel soufflé
for dinner.

27:17.240 --> 27:18.878
Again?

27:18.960 --> 27:20.951
If you'll excuse me, I'm going out to dinner.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.713
That's right. Kermit's got a date
with Lady Holiday.

27:23.800 --> 27:27.429
- You don't have to tell everybody.
- Oh. Right.

27:27.520 --> 27:30.478
Pops, don't tell anybody.
Kermit's got a date with Lady Holiday.

27:30.560 --> 27:32.949
Kermit's got a date
with Lady Holiday?

27:33.040 --> 27:35.952
Oh, wow. Wait till I tell
the guys in the band.

27:36.040 --> 27:38.998
- Tell us what?
- Yeah, what's going down?

27:41.720 --> 27:45.349
Kermit and Lady Holiday? All right!

27:49.640 --> 27:51.676
Fozzie, this is all very embarrassing.

27:51.760 --> 27:54.638
Kermit, don't worry.
It won't go outside this room.

27:55.080 --> 27:59.392
Here is a Muppet news flash.
Kermit the Frog to date Lady Holiday.

27:59.480 --> 28:02.074
Details at 11.

28:08.040 --> 28:10.270
Smile.

28:11.200 --> 28:13.919
Local poultry.

28:19.160 --> 28:22.118
Boy, it's a good thing you didn't
tell everybody where Lady Holiday lives

28:22.200 --> 28:24.270
otherwise they'd all
be camped on her doorstep.

28:24.360 --> 28:27.591
That is just for you and me to know,
brother.

28:27.680 --> 28:32.276
We are going to have ourselves
a time tonight. Wacka wacka.

28:32.360 --> 28:35.352
- "We"? What do you mean "we"?
- The two of us. You missed a spot.

28:35.440 --> 28:37.670
Anyway. When we get there tonight,
just act naturally.

28:37.760 --> 28:40.320
No, no. Wait a second, wait a second.
It's when <i>I get there.</i>

28:40.400 --> 28:45.679
This is my date with Lady Holiday.
I'm going alone. So it's "me" not "we".

28:45.760 --> 28:47.034
Oh.

28:47.120 --> 28:50.317
I see. Fine.

28:50.400 --> 28:52.755
Boy, I wish I had whiskers.

28:52.840 --> 28:54.876
Of course, then I'd have to use a blade.

28:54.960 --> 28:57.554
Kermit? Turn around.

28:57.640 --> 29:01.269
Are you really
going to go without me tonight?

29:01.360 --> 29:05.433
Well, Fozzie, I figure
this is something that I have to do alone.

29:06.840 --> 29:08.398
No problem.

29:08.480 --> 29:11.392
- Oh good. Just hand me my cuff links.
- Yes, sir.

29:11.480 --> 29:13.755
<i>And straighten my tie</i>

29:13.840 --> 29:17.515
<i>Just drench me in rich cologne</i>
<i>and don't ask me why</i>

29:18.520 --> 29:20.476
<i>Go on and pluck me a boutonniere</i>

29:20.560 --> 29:23.199
<i>You're moving up and walking on air</i>

29:23.280 --> 29:27.159
<i>Steppin' out with a star and feeling high</i>

29:28.120 --> 29:30.475
<i>Come polish my wing tips</i>

29:30.560 --> 29:33.154
<i>And call for the car</i>

29:33.560 --> 29:36.996
<i>I'll sweep her right off her feet</i>
<i>wherever we are</i>

29:38.280 --> 29:40.510
<i>A satin collar and velvet vest</i>

29:40.600 --> 29:42.830
<i>I never settle for second best</i>

29:42.920 --> 29:46.549
<i>Steppin' out with a star</i>
<i>Sad times. Bye-bye</i>

29:46.640 --> 29:49.074
<i>Have I got style?</i>

29:49.160 --> 29:51.549
<i>Have I got taste?</i>

29:52.680 --> 29:58.755
<i>On someone else. I swear.</i>
<i>This savoir-faire would be such a waste</i>

30:03.040 --> 30:05.508
- <i>Come toss me my top hat</i>
- Yes, sir!

30:05.600 --> 30:07.909
<i>I'm ready to fly</i>

30:08.000 --> 30:12.357
<i>Busting into the upper crust</i>
<i>as easy as pie</i>

30:12.760 --> 30:15.069
<i>Just watch my dreams come true</i>

30:15.160 --> 30:17.435
<i>This is something I was born to do</i>

30:17.520 --> 30:21.433
<i>Steppin' out with a star</i>
<i>That star is you</i>

30:42.640 --> 30:45.029
- <i>Have you got class?</i>
- <i>Have I got class?</i>

30:45.120 --> 30:47.395
- <i>Have you got chic?</i>
- <i>Have I got chic?</i>

30:47.480 --> 30:52.156
<i>To think that you and me</i>
<i>were nobody. Why. Only last week</i>

30:52.240 --> 30:53.992
Hey, guys!

30:59.240 --> 31:02.152
<i>I'm ready to flyyyyyy</i>

31:03.920 --> 31:07.071
- Kermit!
- At least I can try.

31:07.160 --> 31:09.515
<i>Just watch my dreams come true</i>

31:09.600 --> 31:11.830
<i>This is something I was born to do</i>

31:11.920 --> 31:14.354
<i>Steppin' out with a star</i>
<i>Bye. Bad times</i>

31:14.440 --> 31:16.749
<i>Steppin' out with a star</i>
<i>Hey. Good times</i>

31:16.840 --> 31:20.628
<i>Steppin' out with a star and feeling high</i>

31:23.360 --> 31:25.237
Yeah!

31:25.320 --> 31:27.595
Well, how do I look?

31:28.560 --> 31:30.755
Which one are you?

31:30.840 --> 31:33.035
- I'm the one on the right.
- Oh.

31:33.120 --> 31:36.908
Well, y... you look like you're gonna
have a terrific time.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.514
Without me.

31:39.600 --> 31:41.909
- Fozzie?
- What?

31:42.840 --> 31:45.195
You can come.

31:45.280 --> 31:47.032
- You mean it?
- Mm-hm.

31:47.120 --> 31:49.475
Oh, boy!

31:49.560 --> 31:52.393
Great news, gang. We can go!

32:36.080 --> 32:38.594
Awfully disappointing weather today.

32:38.680 --> 32:40.671
Hm?

32:40.760 --> 32:43.479
The weather. Awfully disappointing today.

32:43.560 --> 32:47.951
Is it, is it? Yes. Mm, yes, yes.
I know what you mean.

32:55.600 --> 32:58.273
It was rather disappointing yesterday.

32:58.360 --> 33:00.749
And the day before.

33:07.960 --> 33:10.633
What is it, Neville?

33:13.520 --> 33:15.590
Um...

33:16.800 --> 33:22.033
Pig... um... climbing up
the outside of the house, dear.

33:22.120 --> 33:23.155
Oh.

33:33.800 --> 33:36.951
Next time they want stunts
they get a double.

33:37.440 --> 33:39.635
The day before that
was awfully disappointing too.

33:39.720 --> 33:41.358
Mm.

33:41.440 --> 33:45.353
And of course the weekend was
perfectly frightful. Never stopped raining.

33:55.280 --> 33:57.840
- Neville?
- Hm?

33:57.920 --> 34:00.514
- Am I boring you?
- What, dear?

34:00.600 --> 34:05.230
- I said, am I boring you?
- Boring me?

34:05.320 --> 34:09.552
That's a good one.
I'm having the time of my life, dear.

34:09.639 --> 34:14.429
Neville, did you say... a <i>pig</i>
was climbing up the outside of the house?

34:16.840 --> 34:20.833
- Yes. Yes. Yes, I believe I did, yes.
- I thought so.

34:20.920 --> 34:23.717
You'd have to look a long way
to find a chap

34:23.800 --> 34:27.839
who was more... stimulated than I am, yes.

34:27.920 --> 34:30.592
Oh, dear me, no, no, no.

34:31.880 --> 34:36.556
The last time I was bored -
and never by you, my little armada...

34:36.639 --> 34:38.835
- What was that?
- Just making a point, dear.

34:38.920 --> 34:41.228
I mean, if I was bored I'd go out
and buy something, wouldn't I?

34:41.320 --> 34:44.995
Like cheese or quails' eggs.

34:45.080 --> 34:47.753
- Something like that.
- Yes, I suppose you would.

34:47.840 --> 34:53.072
Yes, of course I would, dear. That's
the sort of spur-of-the-moment fellow I am.

34:53.159 --> 34:55.196
What?

34:56.480 --> 35:00.189
- What, dear?
- What would you buy if you were bored?

35:01.000 --> 35:03.673
Ah! Uh...

35:06.360 --> 35:08.999
A jar of calf's-foot jelly?

35:12.440 --> 35:14.715
I'd like to come with you
and help you pick one out.

35:14.800 --> 35:17.872
Oh, that isn't necessary, Dorcas.
There's no need for you to leave the house.

35:17.960 --> 35:21.396
I wouldn't mind.
Haven't been outside for 12 years.

35:21.480 --> 35:23.914
Well, the weather's
been most disappointing.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.753
Still, there's no reason
for me to stay here all the time.

35:26.840 --> 35:28.990
The children are gone, the pets are dead,

35:29.080 --> 35:32.038
the butler's been discharged,
no one ever visits us.

35:45.720 --> 35:48.075
That was the doorbell, Neville.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.639
So it was.

35:51.720 --> 35:55.190
- And the butler's dead?
- No, no, no.

35:55.280 --> 35:59.034
The pets are dead.
The butler's been discharged.

35:59.120 --> 36:01.111
Ah.

36:02.960 --> 36:06.157
- I think one of us should answer it, Neville.
- Oh, do you?

36:06.800 --> 36:09.234
Or we could both answer it.

36:09.320 --> 36:12.312
Come, dear, I hardly think it's necessary
for both of us to...

36:12.400 --> 36:14.675
I'll answer it!

36:19.960 --> 36:21.996
I thought you said the pets were dead.

36:23.880 --> 36:26.189
- Hello.
- Uh...

36:26.280 --> 36:28.316
This is for you.

36:28.400 --> 36:31.949
Oh, thank you. Shall we go?

36:32.800 --> 36:37.555
You know, I've never been inside
a real ritzy English house before.

36:38.400 --> 36:42.188
- Aren't you hungry?
- Sure, but we've got a few minutes.

36:42.280 --> 36:44.919
OK. Let's take a few minutes.

36:46.520 --> 36:51.275
- Say, nice place you got here.
- Yes. I practically stole it.

36:52.240 --> 36:54.754
Let me show you around.

36:54.840 --> 36:58.833
- Who was that guy back there?
- Oh. Just some sort of servant.

36:58.920 --> 37:00.911
This, of course, is the drawing room.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.833
Did you decorate this place yourself?

37:04.800 --> 37:09.316
I'll just close the door.
It's very draughty.

37:10.480 --> 37:12.550
There's a chair and some walls.

37:12.640 --> 37:15.154
- A whirlwind tour, huh?
- Yes.

37:15.240 --> 37:18.630
This is the bedroom and, uh... bath.

37:19.600 --> 37:21.750
We have hot and cold running water.

37:21.840 --> 37:25.355
There's probably a bathtub and everything.

37:28.240 --> 37:32.313
Oh, here. I want to show you something.
This is the closet.

37:33.280 --> 37:35.555
Nice. Dark but nice.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.230
Ah. Sorry.

37:47.120 --> 37:52.911
Don't think me rude, but is there,
in fact, anything I can do for you at all?

37:54.600 --> 37:56.511
Um...

37:56.600 --> 37:59.558
Yes. Yes, yes.

37:59.640 --> 38:02.234
You may suggest a nice restaurant.

38:02.320 --> 38:04.709
Ah. Well, there's the Dubonnet Club.

38:04.800 --> 38:07.678
Actually that's not so much a restaurant,
more a supper club.

38:07.760 --> 38:08.795
Ah.

38:08.880 --> 38:12.714
Thank you, Jeeves. No time for cocktails.

38:12.800 --> 38:15.109
Evening.

38:20.800 --> 38:23.155
Why are you staring into the closet,
Neville?

38:23.240 --> 38:26.198
You recall that pig I mentioned?

38:26.280 --> 38:27.713
The one that was climbing
up the side of the house?

38:27.800 --> 38:30.519
- That's the chap. That's the chap.
- Yes, I seem to recall that.

38:30.600 --> 38:34.388
Well, he was in there just now,
along with a... a lizard.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.675
I see. And what did they want?

38:36.760 --> 38:39.718
Name of a good restaurant.
I told them the Dubonnet Club.

38:39.800 --> 38:41.631
That's more of a supper club
than a restaurant.

38:41.720 --> 38:43.392
Yes, well, I tried to tell them that.

38:43.480 --> 38:46.995
- Don't blame yourself.
- No.

38:47.080 --> 38:48.354
No.

38:50.880 --> 38:53.519
Hey! There they are!

38:53.600 --> 38:55.875
Kermit and his new flame.

38:55.960 --> 38:58.713
- Hubba hubba.
- Ding ding!

39:00.440 --> 39:05.958
You'll have to jump in the front seat.
The back seat's been quarantined.

39:07.360 --> 39:10.238
Let's hit the road.
How about a little travelling music?

39:10.320 --> 39:14.313
- For sure. A love song.
- Love song, love song.

39:14.400 --> 39:17.995
Hit it!

39:22.240 --> 39:25.152
<i>Give me my good friends</i>
<i>and play me my music</i>

39:25.240 --> 39:27.470
<i>Yeah. Give me my night life</i>

39:29.040 --> 39:31.759
<i>Talk me that guitar</i>
<i>and roll me that boogie</i>

39:31.840 --> 39:34.229
<i>Yeah. Give me my night life</i>

39:36.160 --> 39:40.073
- Are these your friends?
- Just the ones on the fenders.

39:44.880 --> 39:47.952
<i>Sing me the good times</i>
<i>cos I need the feeling</i>

39:48.040 --> 39:50.429
<i>Yeah. Give me that night life</i>

40:02.800 --> 40:05.837
<i>Give me my night life</i>

40:05.920 --> 40:07.990
<i>Whoo. Yeah</i>

40:10.840 --> 40:13.149
<i>Give me my night life</i>

40:15.400 --> 40:19.393
- They don't have to play this loud.
- That's OK. They don't mind.

40:22.200 --> 40:25.397
<i>Sing me the good times</i>
<i>cos I need the feeling</i>

40:25.480 --> 40:27.789
<i>Give me my night life</i>

40:30.480 --> 40:32.869
<i>Give me my night life</i>

40:58.960 --> 41:02.669
Boy, a classy place like this you'd think
they'd have pretzels on the table.

41:05.320 --> 41:09.029
Well, what a delightful menu.

41:09.120 --> 41:12.157
- What?
- Nothing. It's just sort of amusing

41:12.240 --> 41:16.756
that the roast beef is the same price
as an Oldsmobile.

41:16.840 --> 41:18.831
You come here often, Lady Holiday?

41:18.920 --> 41:21.832
Oh, only on special <i>occasions.</i>

41:21.920 --> 41:24.639
And this is very special, Kermie.

41:24.720 --> 41:27.109
Waiter! Champagne, caviar.

41:27.200 --> 41:30.875
Hey, hey, Kermit.
How are we gonna pay for this?

41:30.960 --> 41:36.717
- You got about 1600 bucks on you?
- Hey, relax, Kermit. I'll take care of it.

41:40.320 --> 41:43.312
Say cheese!

41:43.400 --> 41:45.550
There you go, folks. Souvenir photograph.

41:45.640 --> 41:48.632
Just gimme your name and address
and ten bucks.

41:55.320 --> 41:57.834
Good evening, Lady Holiday.
Such a pleasure to see you.

41:57.920 --> 42:01.754
- Thank you, Stanley.
- Why, what a lovely diamond necklace.

42:02.360 --> 42:04.476
It is rather breathtaking, isn't it?

42:04.560 --> 42:08.792
I thought it a little outré, but my brother
Nicky insisted that I wear it.

42:09.640 --> 42:10.755
Your table, Lady Holiday.

42:10.840 --> 42:12.956
Thank you, Stanley.
Give Stanley a tip, Nicky.

42:13.040 --> 42:15.998
- For complimenting you on your necklace?
- No, because it is customary.

42:16.080 --> 42:18.674
- I don't have any change.
- Then give him something bigger.

42:18.760 --> 42:19.829
Bigger?

42:19.920 --> 42:23.356
- I left my wallet at home.
- You left your wallet in college.

42:23.440 --> 42:25.715
How about you, folks?
Souvenir photograph?

42:25.800 --> 42:26.755
No thanks. No picture.

42:26.840 --> 42:29.752
Aw, come on. It'll be a great memento
for you and your wife.

42:29.840 --> 42:31.671
My wife isn't feeling very well.

42:31.760 --> 42:34.194
That's too bad.
Maybe she should be at home.

42:34.280 --> 42:36.635
My wife is at home.

42:36.720 --> 42:39.518
Yes. Next table!

42:47.400 --> 42:50.392
That caviar was yummy. Mwah!

42:50.480 --> 42:54.155
Love those fish eggs!

42:54.240 --> 42:57.471
- Uh, Lady Holiday?
- Oh. Yes?

42:57.560 --> 42:59.676
Can we talk about the jewel robbery now?

42:59.760 --> 43:02.593
Oh, Kermit. Let us not talk business.

43:02.680 --> 43:07.310
Music is in the air, the night is young,
and I'm so beautiful.

43:08.240 --> 43:12.074
- What jewel robbery?
- Your jewels. The ones that were stolen.

43:12.160 --> 43:15.914
You know, you have lovely eyes.

43:25.280 --> 43:30.149
You know, if you put enough sugar
in this stuff it tastes just like ginger ale.

43:31.600 --> 43:35.957
Catch you later, Stanley.
Aren't you happy we're here?

43:36.040 --> 43:39.112
I have grave doubts
about wearing these jewels.

43:39.200 --> 43:41.316
I feel as if thieves
were breathing down my neck.

43:41.400 --> 43:43.118
Thieves aren't breathing down your neck.

43:43.200 --> 43:44.633
- I want to put them in a safe.
- No.

43:44.720 --> 43:45.914
- Yes.
- Yes, I meant yes.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.070
Why would I say no when I meant yes?

43:48.160 --> 43:49.752
- Go and see Stanley.
- Go and see Stanley?

43:49.840 --> 43:54.436
- Go and see Stanley immediately.
- All right. If that's what you want.

43:54.520 --> 43:58.274
- And don't forget to tip him.
- Tip. Tip.

45:06.320 --> 45:09.710
<i>The first time you see her</i>

45:09.800 --> 45:13.190
<i>No bolt from the blue</i>

45:13.280 --> 45:16.636
<i>Just something so quiet</i>

45:16.720 --> 45:20.269
<i>Yet waiting for you</i>

45:20.360 --> 45:23.796
<i>With no one to tell you</i>

45:23.880 --> 45:27.031
<i>That you've got to go</i>

45:27.120 --> 45:32.752
<i>The first time it happens. You know</i>

45:34.480 --> 45:37.870
<i>The first time you see her</i>

45:37.960 --> 45:41.350
<i>No magical change</i>

45:41.440 --> 45:44.796
<i>No angels appearing</i>

45:44.880 --> 45:48.839
<i>No dreams to arrange</i>

45:48.920 --> 45:51.912
<i>Just warmer and colder</i>

45:52.000 --> 45:55.436
<i>Than springtime or snow</i>

45:55.520 --> 46:00.071
<i>The first time it happens. You know</i>

46:01.720 --> 46:05.349
<i>And so you fall</i>

46:05.440 --> 46:08.716
<i>And how complete it is</i>

46:08.800 --> 46:13.078
<i>And for each moment that it lasts</i>

46:13.160 --> 46:16.550
<i>How sweet it is</i>

46:16.640 --> 46:20.076
<i>The first time together</i>

46:20.160 --> 46:23.596
<i>How simple. How rare</i>

46:23.680 --> 46:26.194
<i>And just when you thought</i>

46:26.280 --> 46:30.717
<i>You'd forgot how to care</i>

46:30.800 --> 46:34.190
<i>And though you feel much more</i>

46:34.280 --> 46:37.716
<i>Than you dare to show</i>

46:37.800 --> 46:42.999
<i>The first time it happens. You know</i>

46:47.200 --> 46:49.350
Wow. She's fantastic.

46:54.840 --> 46:57.718
<i>The first time you see her</i>

46:57.800 --> 47:00.917
<i>No magical change</i>

47:01.000 --> 47:04.231
<i>No angels appearing</i>

47:04.320 --> 47:07.517
<i>No dreams to arrange</i>

47:07.600 --> 47:10.637
<i>Just warmer and colder</i>

47:10.720 --> 47:13.757
<i>Than springtime or snow</i>

47:13.840 --> 47:17.879
<i>The first time it happens. You know</i>

47:17.960 --> 47:20.428
What a great number!

47:25.800 --> 47:27.119
Nicky?

47:27.200 --> 47:29.316
That's my new receptionist
dancing out there.

47:29.400 --> 47:31.868
- Which one?
- The pig.

47:34.960 --> 47:39.556
- She's sensational.
- 45 words a minute. About average.

47:52.280 --> 47:54.510
<i>And just when you thought</i>

47:54.600 --> 48:00.357
- <i>You'd forgot how to care</i>
- <i>For the first time</i>

48:00.440 --> 48:03.000
<i>For the first time</i>

48:03.080 --> 48:05.799
A-ha!

48:24.320 --> 48:27.312
<i>The first time it happens</i>

48:27.400 --> 48:30.312
<i>The moment it happens</i>

48:30.400 --> 48:33.437
<i>Then suddenly there's a whole new world</i>

48:33.520 --> 48:36.114
<i>The first time it happens</i>

48:36.360 --> 48:39.352
<i>The first time it happens</i>

48:39.560 --> 48:44.429
<i>The first time it happens</i>

48:45.360 --> 48:48.193
<i>You know</i>

49:00.160 --> 49:03.550
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

49:08.880 --> 49:11.155
Aieee!

49:11.240 --> 49:13.435
Lady Holiday! What's happened?

49:13.520 --> 49:17.274
- Was it you that screamed, "Aieee!"?
- She screamed right into my ear.

49:17.360 --> 49:19.590
Of course I screamed.
Somebody's just stolen my necklace.

49:19.680 --> 49:22.114
I told you this would happen.
That necklace was worth a fortune.

49:22.200 --> 49:23.838
- Do something.
- What do you want me to do?

49:23.920 --> 49:26.639
I spilled ketchup all over my cummerbund.

49:26.720 --> 49:28.790
For God's sake. Straighten that tie.

49:28.880 --> 49:32.634
It's Lady Holiday, her necklace,
it's been stolen.

49:32.720 --> 49:35.188
"Lady Holiday"? But I thought...

49:36.200 --> 49:39.158
Kermit. I think I've got a picture of the thief.

49:39.240 --> 49:42.198
- Oh, great.
- Yeah!

49:42.280 --> 49:44.271
But...

50:14.080 --> 50:18.995
This is great, Gonzo. You popped the flash
just before the soup landed on his tie.

50:19.080 --> 50:21.275
Yeah, well, photography's an art.

50:21.360 --> 50:24.272
You gotta have the right film,
you gotta have the right exposure,

50:24.360 --> 50:27.158
and you gotta scream
just before they get the food to their mouth.

50:28.400 --> 50:32.279
What's going on in there? Lot
of folks out here want to use the rest room.

50:32.360 --> 50:35.113
Well, we're developing these pictures.
We'll be out as soon as we finish.

50:35.200 --> 50:37.475
- We're trying to catch a jewel thief.
- A jewel thief.

50:37.560 --> 50:39.232
Well, catch him in another room.

50:39.320 --> 50:42.676
People are dancing up and down
on one leg out here.

50:42.760 --> 50:46.150
Hurry, Gonzo. There's gotta be a picture of
somebody taking Lady Holiday's necklace.

50:46.240 --> 50:50.119
Well, I don't know.
I still think that pig took it.

50:50.200 --> 50:52.919
- She wouldn't steal.
- Why not? She lied.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.719
That's two different things. Besides,
she couldn't have stolen the necklace

50:55.800 --> 50:57.916
because she was dancing.

50:58.000 --> 51:02.790
That's right. There's that old adage: You
can't dance and steal at the same time.

51:02.880 --> 51:05.713
No, that's "You can't walk
and chew gum at the same time."

51:05.800 --> 51:09.554
Oh, no. I think it's "You can't pat your head
and rub your stomach at the same time."

51:09.640 --> 51:11.437
What's the difference?
She didn't steal the necklace.

51:11.520 --> 51:12.873
- I bet you I can do it.
- Do what?

51:12.960 --> 51:15.269
Pat my head and rub my stomach
at the same time.

51:15.360 --> 51:18.511
Big deal, anybody can do that.

51:19.480 --> 51:21.789
Would you guys cut it out?
We're wasting time.

51:26.320 --> 51:29.198
- Hey, here it is.
- What? What? What? What?

51:29.280 --> 51:31.635
Look at that.
It's that guy sitting next to Lady Holiday

51:31.720 --> 51:32.948
and those girls standing in the back.

51:33.040 --> 51:35.793
It's probably the same gang
that pulled that first job.

51:35.880 --> 51:36.517
Wow!

51:36.600 --> 51:40.354
Yes, and we got them
with their hands in the cookie jar.

51:41.680 --> 51:45.116
- What's going on?
- What is this, anyway?

51:45.200 --> 51:47.430
Aw.

51:47.520 --> 51:50.592
The cookie jar just busted.

51:58.880 --> 52:02.270
- Look, Dad. There's a bear.
- No, Christine, that's a frog.

52:02.360 --> 52:04.430
Bears wear hats.

52:14.160 --> 52:16.754
How you doing, young fella?

52:16.840 --> 52:18.910
OK, I guess.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.389
Penny for your thoughts.

52:21.480 --> 52:23.630
Well, it's a long story.

52:24.560 --> 52:28.075
- But a familiar one, I bet.
- Mm.

52:28.560 --> 52:29.913
Older than the hills.

52:30.000 --> 52:33.959
I've been there, my friend.
I've been there and back.

52:34.040 --> 52:37.237
You know, I see the way you're sitting here

52:37.320 --> 52:40.392
and I see the way you've got your hand
around that little shoe, and that's all I need.

52:40.480 --> 52:43.597
- I know your whole story.
- You do?

52:43.680 --> 52:48.356
Absolutely.
I know exactly what happened to you.

52:48.440 --> 52:50.908
- What?
- Well, I tell you, friend.

52:51.000 --> 52:54.595
What happened was
you and your brother-in-law Bernie,

52:54.680 --> 52:58.389
you cashed in your stock certificates
and your insurance policy

52:58.480 --> 53:02.189
and you went out and bought
a dry-cleaning establishment.

53:02.280 --> 53:06.319
Now another place opens up
down the street and it's charging less.

53:06.400 --> 53:09.119
And they're getting the stuff out faster
because they got more help.

53:09.200 --> 53:12.272
It's not your fault. Right?

53:12.360 --> 53:14.715
All right. So Bernie comes to you, he says:

53:14.800 --> 53:17.872
"I want you to buy me out."
He says he's fed up.

53:17.960 --> 53:20.997
Well, your kids are growing up,
you never see 'em

53:21.080 --> 53:23.674
and all of a sudden,
they're turning into juvenile delinquents

53:23.760 --> 53:24.875
and your wife is saying to you:

53:24.960 --> 53:28.589
"Listen, you care more about this
lousy business than you care about me."

53:28.680 --> 53:31.990
And the equipment breaks down
and your sister moves in with you

53:32.080 --> 53:34.753
because that jerk Bernie,
he went and joined the circus.

53:34.840 --> 53:37.115
Well, you had it up to here, right?

53:37.200 --> 53:39.350
You didn't know what to do.

53:39.440 --> 53:43.228
So what did you do?
You did the only thing you could do.

53:43.320 --> 53:45.311
You dumped the business for a song.

53:45.400 --> 53:47.277
- And who did you sell it to?
- Who?

53:47.360 --> 53:51.990
You sold it to that jerk down the street, that
slob that had been burying you for a year.

53:52.080 --> 53:54.310
Then you took whatever money
you had left

53:54.400 --> 53:57.312
and you sunk it
into the glass slipper business.

53:57.400 --> 54:00.631
That's your story, my friend.
Not a happy one, is it?

54:03.840 --> 54:07.071
You know, it's amazing.
You are 100 per cent wrong.

54:07.160 --> 54:09.390
I mean, nothing you've said has been right.

54:09.480 --> 54:11.710
Oh, yeah?

54:13.840 --> 54:15.876
Well, how about this?

54:15.960 --> 54:19.475
I hate to be rude,
but we're trying to do a movie here.

54:19.560 --> 54:21.596
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hm.

54:21.680 --> 54:24.672
Oh, I didn't know that. Gee, I'm sorry.

54:24.760 --> 54:27.149
Listen, one thing, son.

54:27.960 --> 54:30.838
Would you like to buy a watch?

54:32.480 --> 54:34.596
No.

54:36.960 --> 54:38.712
Movie stars.

54:41.200 --> 54:44.112
Get your filthy hands off me!

54:44.840 --> 54:49.197
- I beg your pardon, young lady!
- Just keep your hands to yourself, turkey.

54:49.280 --> 54:52.158
Hey, you.

54:52.240 --> 54:56.472
Well, well, well.
If it isn't the fake Lady Holiday.

54:56.560 --> 54:57.549
Hello.

54:58.600 --> 55:01.910
"Hello"? Last night
you never even said goodbye.

55:02.000 --> 55:05.390
Kermit, that was just silliness.

55:05.480 --> 55:08.392
But you lied to me. You used me.

55:09.360 --> 55:12.397
Oh, Kermit, please,
let me explain. Kermit.

55:12.480 --> 55:15.790
- My name is Miss Piggy. I am a model.
- Yeah.

55:15.880 --> 55:19.077
I only lied because I wanted to be with you.

55:19.160 --> 55:22.118
Yeah, well, I saw the way
you were dancing with that guy last night.

55:22.200 --> 55:24.555
- Oh, Kermit.
- Well, lemme tell you something.

55:24.640 --> 55:29.919
Your dancing partner happens to be
a jewel thief. What do you think of that?

55:30.000 --> 55:33.436
- You're jealous.
- I am not.

55:33.520 --> 55:36.193
You are. You are, you are, you are, you are.

55:37.840 --> 55:40.513
Kermit, I'm sorry.
Please don't go, Kermit. Please.

55:40.600 --> 55:43.876
Please don't go. Kermit, please.
Oh, please, I'm sorry. Please.

55:43.960 --> 55:45.791
- Piggy. Piggy, hold it.
- Please, please, please.

55:45.880 --> 55:48.314
- Piggy. Piggy?
- Please, please, please.

55:48.400 --> 55:50.356
- You're overacting.
- What?

55:50.440 --> 55:52.715
You're overacting. You're hamming it up.

55:52.800 --> 55:55.234
I am not. I am trying to save this movie.

55:55.320 --> 55:57.390
Oh, yeah?
Well, save your performance instead.

55:57.480 --> 56:01.155
- I am playing 800 different emotions.
- Well, try to play one of them right.

56:01.240 --> 56:03.435
Oh, oh! I have a career of my own.

56:03.520 --> 56:06.398
- I know all about your career, Pig.
- I don't need this lousy duck pond here.

56:06.480 --> 56:08.118
- Sure you don't need a lousy duck pond.
- I'll just walk.

56:08.200 --> 56:10.634
- OK, sure. Go ahead, walk. OK?
- Should I walk? Then I'll walk.

56:10.720 --> 56:12.950
Walk! Go ahead and walk.

56:14.520 --> 56:16.590
Oh, Piggy.

56:17.960 --> 56:20.349
- Listen.
- I'm doing my best.

56:20.440 --> 56:23.193
I know you are.

56:23.280 --> 56:26.158
Piggy, I'm sorry.

56:26.240 --> 56:29.835
- We gotta get back to the movie though.
- All right. All right, all right, all right.

56:31.520 --> 56:34.876
Kermit, I'm sorry I left you
last night at the nightclub.

56:34.960 --> 56:37.520
Well, that's OK, Piggy.

56:38.520 --> 56:42.069
- Oh, Kermie.
- Oh, Piggy.

56:56.960 --> 57:00.396
<i>Pretty day. Sunny sky</i>

57:00.480 --> 57:04.075
<i>Lovely pictures dance in your eye</i>

57:04.160 --> 57:07.994
<i>It all seems so right</i>

57:08.080 --> 57:11.197
<i>It all feels so rare</i>

57:12.960 --> 57:16.669
<i>Summer soft sudden breeze</i>

57:16.760 --> 57:20.639
<i>Watch the wind play tag in the trees</i>

57:20.720 --> 57:24.110
<i>The world is so bright</i>

57:24.200 --> 57:29.433
<i>So perfectly fair</i>

57:29.520 --> 57:32.910
<i>Lovers sing. Children dance</i>

57:33.000 --> 57:36.470
<i>For a minute. We've got a chance</i>

57:36.920 --> 57:40.469
<i>Why couldn't we fly?</i>

57:40.560 --> 57:45.111
<i>I know we'd get by</i>

57:45.200 --> 57:49.273
<i>Couldn't we fly?</i>

57:52.960 --> 57:56.555
<i>Sunny sky. Pretty day</i>

57:56.640 --> 58:00.428
<i>Just a push and we're on the way</i>

58:00.520 --> 58:03.990
<i>Yes. Couldn't we ride</i>

58:04.080 --> 58:08.073
<i>Side by side?</i>

58:13.120 --> 58:15.031
Whoa!

58:20.200 --> 58:22.589
Whoa!

58:23.400 --> 58:26.597
"Look, Ma, no brains."

58:26.680 --> 58:30.195
Hup. Whoo, Miss Piggy.

58:31.600 --> 58:33.556
Whoa!

58:34.280 --> 58:35.793
Wah! Oof!

58:54.920 --> 58:58.515
<i>Why couldn't we fly?</i>

58:58.600 --> 59:03.276
<i>I know we'd get by</i>

59:03.360 --> 59:07.194
- <i>Sunny sky</i>
- <i>Pretty day</i>

59:07.280 --> 59:11.193
<i>Just a push and we're on the way</i>

59:11.280 --> 59:14.670
<i>Yes. Couldn't we ride</i>

59:14.760 --> 59:18.594
<i>Side by side?</i>

59:18.680 --> 59:24.312
<i>Couldn't we ride?</i>

59:39.680 --> 59:42.558
Gangway! Watch it. Coming through.

59:42.640 --> 59:44.835
She's wonderful. She's so wonderful.

59:44.920 --> 59:47.992
She certainly seems to know
where she's going. It's time.

59:49.880 --> 59:52.348
All right, everybody.
Keep it moving. Don't linger.

59:52.440 --> 59:54.476
We just want to give them a hint,
a taste, a soupçon.

59:54.560 --> 59:56.357
Appetisers not four-course meals.

59:56.440 --> 59:58.874
Marie. I don't think we should chew gum.

59:59.520 --> 01:00:04.036
Stephanie, those false eyelashes are
coming unglued. Those shoes are scuffed.

01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:06.509
- I know where they are. I'll get them...
- Sorry.

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:09.717
Watch it, buster. Oh. Mr Holiday, I'm sorry.

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:11.677
Hello.

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:12.988
- Miss...
- Piggy.

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:14.229
- Miss Piggy?
- Right.

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:16.276
Of course.

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:19.238
Have dinner with me tonight.

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:21.675
Mr Holiday, really, I'm very busy.

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:24.479
- Could we meet just for a moment?
- Underwear, underwear, underwear.

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:27.313
Just one brief moment, Miss Piggy. Miss...

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:28.150
Hm?

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:30.834
Miss Piggy.

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:33.912
You're a very different-looking woman.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.276
I'm so tired of the same type.
Those tall, thin creatures

01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:40.591
with the long legs, the aquiline noses,

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:44.150
the teeth like pearls, soft skin.

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:47.755
Yeah, well, I can see why
that might make you sick to your stomach.

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:49.637
- Please now... Please...
- Miss Piggy.

01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:52.632
No! Please! No. Please, please.

01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:56.916
Don't put a door between us.

01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:59.154
- Hi.
- Oh, Kermit.

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:02.755
I was looking for the men's room.

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:05.798
Kermit, I just want you to meet someone.
This is Nicky Holiday.

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:08.838
Mr Holiday,
this is Kermit, my special friend.

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:10.953
Oh.

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:14.594
Nice to meet you.

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:17.069
Well, excuse me.

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:21.998
- Need I say more?
- He's a frog, isn't he?

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:24.955
Yes.

01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:29.630
Miss Piggy.

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:34.315
We could've had something
very, very special.

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:38.596
Now, I can't be responsible
for what might happen.

01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:41.114
Yeah, well, uh...

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:43.589
<i>C'est la vie.</i>

01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:46.989
I don't know why you love her like you do.

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:50.390
I don't know why. I just do.

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:52.516
Well, you'd better snap out of it, and fast.

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:55.034
We've got to plant the goods on her
to take the heat off us.

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:57.190
I know the plan.
I just wish there was another way.

01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:00.192
It's the only way. Especially now
the cops are starting to ask questions.

01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:03.909
OK, I'll do my job.
When I give the signal, you do yours.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.231
Forgive me, Miss Piggy.

01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:12.038
- Am I dressed right for this?
- You look fine, Fozzie.

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:14.236
Thank you.

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:17.835
And now,
without further ado,

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:20.878
roses, hyacinths,

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:24.032
lilacs and bluebells

01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:28.079
- make up our first fashion bouquet.
- Ooh!

01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:32.594
- Pretty nice lines, huh?
- Yes and the dresses aren't bad either.

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:35.353
Here's capricious Carla,

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:38.591
a dream in hyacinth-blue chiffon

01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:43.117
with the classic allure
of the white pleated collar and cuffs.

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:45.475
The skirt, a flutter of godets,

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:48.916
all complemented
by the cloudy folds of blue

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.754
forming the perfect flower-framing hat.

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:55.593
<i>Fantastique.</i> And thank you, Carla.

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:59.389
- Pretty good-looking duds.
- I found the white pleated collar alluring,

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:03.234
but I was rather taken aback
by the flutter of godets.

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:04.639
Mm-hm.

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:09.149
And now here's delicious Darla

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:11.196
in a swirl of apricot silk

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:15.034
above a tight bodice
with a cleverly-draped décolletage.

01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:21.000
Finishing with roses to match the
confection of flowers and silk on her head,

01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:24.038
forming a teeny-weeny hat.

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:32.638
Oh. Ow! My knee. I think I've twisted it.

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:34.950
You all right? You've got to get up!
You've got to go on!

01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:37.349
I can't go on!

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:39.749
Oh! You poor thing.

01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:43.276
Oh, don't worry, Marla.
I'll stay right here with you.

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:47.035
You can't. You've got to go on in her place.

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:54.078
And now, the Lady Holiday
swimwear collection.

01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:57.436
Hey, Waldorf, wake up.
Here come the bikinis.

01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:00.193
Oh, boy. We'd better
synchronise our pacemakers.

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:06.196
A cloud of lavender starburst pleating
surrounds our next model.

01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:09.192
Oh, I say!

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:07.677
<i>A miracle of spring</i>

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:10.832
<i>A miracle of beauty</i>

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:16.916
<i>Be dazzled by the magic of one smile</i>

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.958
<i>A vision of loveliness</i>

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:22.315
<i>A universe of charms</i>

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:27.918
<i>We'll never rest until you're in our arms</i>

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:39.398
<i>Daffodils. Miss Piggy</i>

01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:42.836
<i>Whippoorwills. Miss Piggy</i>

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:49.314
<i>Everything that's lovely.</i>
<i>Warm and spring. Miss Piggy</i>

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:52.710
<i>Fantasy. Miss Piggy</i>

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:55.917
<i>Ecstasy. Miss Piggy</i>

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.798
<i>All that's fair or fine or wonderful</i>

01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:02.190
<i>Or anything. Miss Piggy</i>

01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:08.037
<i>Where does the rapture</i>
<i>begin and grow?</i>

01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:14.992
<i>Where does devotion and passion go?</i>

01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:18.356
<i>Happiness. Miss Piggy</i>

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:21.716
<i>One caress. Miss Piggy</i>

01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:25.793
<i>All the world's ever wanted was you</i>

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:28.633
<i>A dream come true</i>

01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:33.032
<i>Oh. Miss Piggy. It's you</i>

01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:53.634
<i>Where does the rapture</i>
<i>begin and grow?</i>

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:59.636
<i>Where does devotion and passion go?</i>

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:03.956
<i>Happiness. Miss Piggy</i>

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:07.157
<i>One caress. Miss Piggy</i>

01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:11.358
<i>All the world's ever wanted was you</i>

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:13.954
<i>A dream come true</i>

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:28.278
<i>Oh. Miss Piggy. It's you</i>

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:30.078
<i>It's you</i>

01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:33.397
<i>It's you</i>

01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:51.194
Oh, Miss Piggy, are you OK?

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:55.910
Yeah, sure.
I was just looking for my contact lens.

01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:05.554
Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:08.598
Oh, dear. Oh, you poor thing.

01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:11.240
Excuse me. Here, put this on.

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:13.117
- You'll get a chill.
- Thank you very much.

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:14.474
- You all right?
- I don't know what happened.

01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:16.630
I must've tripped.

01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:19.029
Wait a minute. What's this?

01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:22.590
I don't think these belong to me.

01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:25.069
Do you recognise this?

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.072
That was my necklace.
But... where are the diamonds?

01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:33.038
- Where are the diamonds?
- Miss Piggy stole my necklace.

01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:37.795
- Miss Piggy, how could you?
- No! No! I don't know anything about it!

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:41.077
Somebody must've put it... You!

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:43.754
- It was you! Kermit was right there!
- Oh, no, no, no!

01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:46.354
You're a phoney! Yes you are.

01:08:46.439 --> 01:08:50.591
And you know what? You can't even sing!
Your voice was dubbed.

01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:53.274
Watch out, guys. Kermit!

01:08:53.359 --> 01:08:55.510
Don't worry, Miss Piggy.
We'll get you out of this.

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:58.238
It just goes to show
you can't trust anybody.

01:08:58.319 --> 01:09:00.709
Excuse me, Lady Holiday,
will you be hiring any more pigs?

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:03.598
Well, I shall certainly think twice about it.

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:07.274
Kermit, find out if they'll let me
keep the costumes.

01:09:07.359 --> 01:09:10.113
What about your most famous piece of
jewellery, the fabulous Baseball Diamond?

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:12.634
As from Monday,
the fabulous Baseball Diamond

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:15.439
will go on permanent display
at the Mallory Gallery.

01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:19.798
I shall never have it either on my person
or in my possession again.

01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:21.598
That's right. It'll be in our possession.

01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:23.716
Tuesday at midnight
we'll go to the Mallory Gallery.

01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:26.633
The Baseball Diamond will be ours.

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:31.559
<i>So there I was.</i>
<i>Backstage under a table.</i>

01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:35.189
I was doing a little photographic essay
on kneecaps,

01:09:35.279 --> 01:09:38.670
and I heard 'em planning to steal
the Baseball Diamond.

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:39.749
Bummer.

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:42.479
- So what's the plan, man?
- I already told you.

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:46.678
Tuesday, midnight, at the Mallory Gallery.
That's all I know.

01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:48.876
You mean they're really gonna
try to steal the diamond?

01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:58.672
Quiet!

01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:01.035
"Look, Mother, it's my life, OK?"

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:05.318
"So if I want to live on a beach
and walk around naked..."

01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:06.515
Oh.

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:08.830
Now, if we wanna get
Miss Piggy out of jail,

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:11.593
we're gonna have to catch
those thieves red-handed.

01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:12.556
Yes, Beau?

01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:16.189
What colour are their hands now?

01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:19.238
Now, we're about to embark
on a potentially dangerous mission.

01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:22.551
There could be physical violence,
there could be gunplay,

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:25.154
and there's a slightest chance
that somebody might even get killed.

01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:28.391
So if anybody wants out,
now is the time to say it.

01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:30.072
- I'm out.
- Me too.

01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:31.673
- Ditto.
- Meep.

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:34.957
Don't we have a gig around here,
or something or somewhere?

01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:37.634
Yeah, sorry. I got a dental appointment.

01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:39.915
It's like this, Kermit.
I have to go to work all day.

01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:45.960
Hold it!

01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:50.636
Shame on you.

01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:54.472
I thought we were in this thing together.

01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:58.997
I'm just as scared as you are,
but this has to be done.

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:03.714
We don't want the bad guys to win.

01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:07.349
We've got to do this for... for... for justice.

01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:10.910
For... freedom. For... honesty.

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:15.110
Boy, do I feel ashamed.

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:17.919
Me too. I feel like two cents.

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:21.914
- I'm back in.
- You can count on me.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.991
Oh, hey, I was only joking.

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:27.311
Yeah, it'll be a lot of fun
to go out there and risk our lives.

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:29.391
- Yeah!
- All for one and one for all.

01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:30.674
Yeah!

01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:35.231
At times like this
I am proud to be an American.

01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:39.193
Thank you. I knew I could count
on each and every one of you.

01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:42.511
Fozzie, are you OK?

01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:45.160
That took a lot out of me.

01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:48.277
OK. Now we don't have any time to waste,
so everybody gather round.

01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:51.158
And the first thing we have to do
is make our plans.

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:52.992
- Right.
- Whoa!

01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:57.280
Or we could get some sleep.

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:15.313
- Miss Piggy?
- What?

01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:17.755
Your lawyer is here to see you.

01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:20.479
Lawyer? I don't have a lawyer.

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:23.358
Och, sure you do. Little green guy.

01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:29.798
Kermie! No wonder he hasn't come by
to see me. He had to finish law school.

01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:41.513
Oh, Kermit! Oh!

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:44.319
Two minutes, pig.

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:49.235
- Oh, Kermie. Oh, I've missed you so.
- Please. The name is Rosenthal.

01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:52.150
I'm your attorney.
That's the only way they'd let me in here.

01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:54.629
Oh, right.

01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:58.793
I've missed you so... Rosenthal.
It's been an eternity.

01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:03.757
- It's been 45 minutes.
- Time goes slow in the cooler.

01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:06.035
Well, I just want you to know
that we're gonna get you out of here,

01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:08.634
cos we're gonna catch those thieves
red-handed.

01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:11.280
What colour are their hands now?

01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:14.272
I don't think this is the time
for that type of humour.

01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:17.909
When you're in stir you take the laughs
when you can get 'em, Rosenthal.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.560
Yeah, well, anyway, just stay put

01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:23.234
because we've got a plan
and we're gonna prove you're innocent.

01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:26.710
You see, tomorrow night...
precisely at midnight,

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:29.792
those thieves are gonna try to steal
Lady Holiday's Baseball Diamond

01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:31.233
from the Mallory Gallery.

01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:34.278
- And we're gonna stop 'em.
- Oh, Kermit, be careful.

01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:36.635
Don't worry
because I've got Gonzo and Fozzie

01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:39.951
and all our friends
from the Happiness Hotel to help.

01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:41.758
- Those clowns?
- Mm-hm.

01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:45.230
Great. I'll be stuck in the big house for life.

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:48.118
"Big house"? Is that prison talk?

01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:53.672
Yeah, "big house", "squealer", "slammer".
That's the lingo we use here in the joint.

01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:56.433
Yeah. Well, you may talk tough,
Miss Piggy,

01:13:56.520 --> 01:14:00.638
but underneath I know you're still the same
beautiful, sensitive, vulnerable woman

01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:04.633
I was out with the other night.
The one who scarfed down all that caviar.

01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:08.869
You have such a way with words.

01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:11.235
I love you, Rosenthal.

01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:27.480
You're wearing my moustache.

01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:33.838
Yeah, well, you have mesh marks
on your face.

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:45.637
- Glass cutter?
- Check.

01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:47.790
- Nylon rope?
- Check.

01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:50.599
- Computer deprogrammer?
- Check.

01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:52.511
- Stopwatch?
- Check.

01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:54.636
- Pocket laser?
- Check.

01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:57.280
- Infrared reflex?
- Check.

01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:58.873
- Portable detonator?
- Check.

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:02.397
- Whoopee cushion?
- I think it's in the bus.

01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:05.711
- Rubber raft?
- It's got holes in it.

01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:08.997
Bag of chickens?

01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:12.311
- Fake vomit?
- It's on order.

01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:14.550
- Frisbee?
- Lost.

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:16.358
- Pneumatic drill?
- Check.

01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:18.237
- Computer printout?
- Check.

01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:20.276
- Radar gun?
- Check.

01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:21.952
- Walkie-talkies?
- Check.

01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:38.672
- Wax lips?
- Man, I just had 'em.

01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:42.992
- Did you leave them in your other pants?
- I don't have no other pants.

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:45.640
- Yo-yo?
- For sure.

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:47.597
- Harpoon gun?
- That's you.

01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:50.194
Check.

01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:54.353
All right, team. Let's go for it.

01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:57.159
- Peanut butter?
- Animal ate it.

01:15:57.240 --> 01:16:00.357
Sorry.

01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:02.158
Well, Kermit,

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:04.310
I guess that's it.

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:06.630
All right, everybody.

01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:09.951
Let's go for it.

01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:27.996
Go for it!

01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:40.196
Beauregard.

01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:42.316
Back it up here.

01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:45.596
Sh. Sh.

01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:48.240
- OK. Quiet.
- Sh.

01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:51.232
OK. You guys
all got your disguises in place?

01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:52.958
Sh.

01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:55.235
Wow.

01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:20.392
- Wow!
- Sh!

01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:22.471
- I'm taking a picture.
- Sh.

01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:24.073
Rowlf, hand me the blowtorch.

01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:26.435
Blowtorch? Who said
anything about a blowtorch?

01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:29.159
I got some paper towels.

01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:31.754
How are we supposed to cut through
the bars if nobody brought stuff to cut with?

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:35.196
I brought some hot mustard.
Maybe that'll eat through the bars.

01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:36.633
Eat through the bars!

01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:38.438
- Animal?
- What?

01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:42.559
Hey. Why don't you see if you
can eat through these iron bars.

01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:44.949
Eat through bars.

01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:57.434
- Doggy!
- The cops!

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.879
Do you know where Lady Holiday's
Baseball Diamond is being kept?

01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:09.512
Funnily enough, I do.
It's at the Mallory Gallery,

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:14.151
a virtually impregnable fortress,
many miles from here.

01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:18.028
- I only have a half an hour to get there.
- On foot? You'll never make it.

01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:21.950
- I know. How about a ride?
- You can read, I presume?

01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:24.190
"No passengers."

01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:27.875
Oh, couldn't you make an exception
for little old <i>moi?</i>

01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:30.599
Not even for little old <i>vous.</i>

01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:33.956
- Pretty please?
- No!

01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:36.554
I've tried to be nice.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.036
- Huh?
- Hiii-yah!

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:45.913
Hey.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.390
- What's all the racket?
- What are you doing here?

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:54.156
- A very brief cameo.
- Me too.

01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:23.476
Breaker one, this is Hamhock.
Do you read me?

01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:27.473
<i>Loud and clear. Hamhock.</i>
<i>This is Dirty Bird. What's your 20. over?</i>

01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:29.949
Well, good buddy,
we're westbound out of Highgate.

01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:32.156
Any smokies between me
and Blimeytown?

01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:34.913
<i>Negatory. Hamhock.</i>
<i>You're free and clear.</i>

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.070
Ten-four, Dirty Bird. Much obliged.

01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:39.799
We got the hammer down and we gone.

01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:43.870
I never ordered no pepperoni.

01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:46.872
It's right here on the slip.
Medium pepperoni with double cheese.

01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:50.111
That's-a right. We don't-a
make them, we just-a deliver them.

01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:53.192
Somebody here called Pizza Twins,
and that's us.

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:55.669
What's the name on that slip?

01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:58.915
Uh...

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.560
- What's your name?
- Henderson.

01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:05.472
- That's it! That's the name on the slip.
- Ah!

01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:10.150
- But I hate pepperoni.
- I'll eat it.

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:12.800
- Stand by, guys.
- Right!

01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:18.075
Ooh.

01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:22.636
'Ere. Just one moment.

01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:27.314
- Can I see that slip?
- Uh... uh... well...

01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:30.117
Actually, this is the wrong slip.

01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:33.033
That slip, sir,
you said it had my name on it.

01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:35.270
Oh, that-a slip.

01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:39.751
That-a slip we left at home.
But we got-a the pepperoni.

01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:42.400
- But I hate pepperoni.
- Hate pepperoni. Right.

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:46.439
- How about you could feed it to the dogs?
- Yes. That's-a right. Here, sir.

01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:49.478
Oh, that's very thoughtful of you.
Thank you very much, sir.

01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:05.830
What am I? A glutton for punishment?

01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:18.755
- Hey, Fozzie...
- Sh.

01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:21.115
Fozzie, how do we get in?

01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:25.193
- Why don't we just ring the doorbell?
- No, no, no. There's got to be another way.

01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:29.751
Well, you'd better think of it pretty quick.
Those dogs have nearly finished the pizza.

01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:34.038
- I know. The roof.
- Oh, man. No way we'll ever get up there.

01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:07.237
Phew.

01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:11.598
- So far I'm not having any fun.
- Let me talk to 'em.

01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:14.515
Woof woof. Woof woof.

01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:20.999
It helps to know a second language.

01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:25.912
It's nearly midnight.
What am I going to do?

01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:28.871
Hey! Hey, you! Hey!

01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:41.349
What an unbelievable coincidence.

01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:02.319
Now, this window probably
has an alarm system on it.

01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:06.632
My assistant Beaker will check it out.
Go on, Beaker.

01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:24.438
Very good, Beaker. Now it's perfectly safe.

01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:27.910
Oh, good. Animal, do your stuff.

01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:36.438
Sorry.

01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:50.638
There it is.
The fabulous Baseball Diamond.

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:53.313
How are we
gonna get down there?

01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:55.277
I suggest we jump.

01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:57.828
Are you crazy?
That's about a hundred feet.

01:24:57.920 --> 01:24:59.990
I didn't say it was a good suggestion.

01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:02.753
Maybe we could jump partway.

01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:10.871
Oh, boy, what do we do now?

01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:14.077
We're just gonna have to go down there
and catch those thieves red-handed.

01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:17.072
What colour are their hands now?

01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:31.158
We'll just have to improvise. We'll make
a ladder out of whatever will hold us.

01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:35.597
Good idea. Here's the paper towels.

01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:39.917
I'm coming, Kermie!

01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:47.349
Well, you wanted excitement.

01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:41.711
Excuse me, I don't think
that belongs to you.

01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:50.033
Say cheese!

01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:53.709
Woman!

01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:55.950
Hey, nice catch, Animal.

01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:58.873
- Heads up, Lew.
- Over here, Rowlf! Yeah, got it!

01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:01.838
Hot potato! Keep away. Here we go.

01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:06.079
I got it. Thank you. Be careful, guys.

01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:08.390
Catch it. Get him!

01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:12.315
Still got a good eye.

01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:15.631
Welcome to the wild world
of Muppet sports.

01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:18.075
This is Louis Kazagger
with a play-by-play

01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:19.309
- of the game.
- Woman!

01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:22.119
And it looks like ladies' night
here at the gallery.

01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:25.033
- Peekaboo.
- Hey! Ba-ba-do-be-bop.

01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:28.078
OK. Here she comes, boy!

01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:37.595
Hey, way to chuck,
way to look, way to move!

01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:42.071
Popcorn, popcorn.
Get your red-hot popcorn.

01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:50.272
Popcorn, chicken?

01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:52.755
Woman!

01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:57.278
- Woman!
- OK, OK.

01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:01.194
Lew Zealand leads off the order
as we join the game.

01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:05.710
- Chuck it to me, Beakie baby.
- Pitchy witchy, Beaker.

01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:08.109
Pitcher, you couldn't hit
the front side of a barn!

01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:10.395
Picture of the pitcher.

01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:12.471
Wait for what you want, Lew, baby.

01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:13.788
Rah, rah, rah!

01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:16.633
Beaker goes into the windup.

01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:20.633
It's the pitch.
It's a high fly ball to Kermit the Frog.

01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:23.075
I got it. I got it. I got it.

01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:27.519
Hey, gimme that diamond, you crook.

01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:30.800
- Come on, guys. Get him.
- All right. Back off!

01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:34.958
But, Nicky, why are you doing this?

01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:38.032
Why am I doing this?
Because I'm a villain. It's pure and simple.

01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:40.554
Excuse me, Mr Holiday, sir.

01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:43.837
Would you let Kermit go? If you hold him
too long he'll just give you warts.

01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:47.196
Oh, no. He's coming with us.
Come on, girls. Let's get out of here.

01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:08.795
Hii-yah!

01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:10.951
Hiii-yah!

01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:16.314
Hii-yah!

01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:19.948
- Hii-yah!
- Ow!

01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:22.235
- Watch out!
- Miss Piggy!

01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:24.675
Yeah! Way to go!

01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:27.909
Ha ha ha ha.

01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:44.630
Bye-bye.

01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:49.678
- You were magnificent, Miss Piggy.
- I did it all for you.

01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:51.239
- Could I have just a moment?
- Thank you.

01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:53.470
<i>Por nada.</i>

01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:55.357
Oh.

01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:57.908
- I really did care for you, you know.
- I know.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.912
We could've had the world
on a silver platter.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:05.437
- That silver's turned to iron bars, Nicky.
- Don't hate me, Miss Piggy.

01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:08.956
Oh, I don't.
It's just that somehow along the road

01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:11.554
I found out the difference
between wrong and right.

01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:13.835
You're wrong...

01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:16.070
He's right.

01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:24.512
Would you believe it, Statler? They're
heroes. Now they're gonna be obnoxious.

01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:26.716
So what else is new?

01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:32.156
- Well, I say all's well that ends well.
- It doesn't matter to me as long as it ends.

01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:42.194
It was nice of the <i>Chronicle</i>
to pay for our flight home.

01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:45.716
Yeah, but a man should be treated
better than his luggage.

01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:48.314
Yeah, well, my luggage
was sucked out the door.

01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:51.392
Luckily my radio's frozen to my wrist.

01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:54.677
OK, guys. Everybody out for the USA.

01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:56.955
Oh, boy. How close are we?

01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:59.235
Oh, about 30,000 feet.

01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:01.595
- You mean?
- Yup.

01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:04.114
Happy landing!

01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:06.395
Whoa!

01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:08.710
Come on, carrot-top.

01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:23.550
- <i>We've had comedy</i>
- <i>We've had mystery</i>

01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:26.712
<i>We've had a real good time</i>
<i>and solved a crime real easily</i>

01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:30.315
- <i>Hey. A movie</i>
- <i>I just can't believe they did it</i>

01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:33.631
- <i>Starring everybody</i>
- And me!

01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:36.996
- <i>There was spectacle</i>
- <i>There was fantasy</i>

01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:40.390
- <i>Where we took a chance</i>
- <i>And saw romance end happily</i>

01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:42.436
- <i>In a movie</i>
- Oh, Kermie!

01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:43.794
<i>I just love a happy ending</i>

01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:47.475
- <i>One for everybody</i>
- <i>Everybody</i>

01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:50.711
- <i>Everybody</i>
- <i>Everybody</i>

01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:54.396
- <i>Everybody</i>
- <i>Everybody</i>

01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:57.153
<i>Everybody in the world</i>

01:31:57.240 --> 01:31:58.639
- And me.
- And me.

01:31:58.840 --> 01:32:00.398
- And me.
- And me.

01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:02.272
- And me.
- And me.

01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:04.749
And me.

01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:07.115
- And me.
- And me.

01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:08.958
- And me.
- And me.

01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:10.632
And me.

01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:12.631
- And me.
- And me.

01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:14.790
And me.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.468
And me.

01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:38.550
<i>Just warmer and colder</i>

01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:42.110
<i>Than springtime or snow</i>

01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:47.991
<i>The first time it happens. You know</i>

01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:55.356
<i>And so you fall</i>

01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:58.830
<i>And how complete it is</i>

01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:03.277
<i>And for each moment that it lasts</i>

01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:06.432
<i>How sweet it is</i>

01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:48.430
Wait a minute!
Wait! Hold it right there.

01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:50.590
Don't go home yet.

01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:52.636
Say cheese.

01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:56.516
I'll send you each a copy.
