(<i>crickets chirping</i>)

00:28.750 --> 00:31.026

(<i>shrieks, groans</i>)

00:46.542 --> 00:47.400
Oh!

00:47.500 --> 00:47.942
Oh, God,

00:48.042 --> 00:50.026
Phoebe-- I didn't
realize you were home.

00:50.126 --> 00:51.399
Are you okay?
I'm sorry.

00:51.499 --> 00:52.399
Are you all right?

00:52.499 --> 00:53.109
Yes, I'm fine!

00:53.209 --> 00:55.984
Uh... Feeling a little
jumpy, are we?

00:56.084 --> 00:58.399
Oh... yeah, especially
now that we know

00:58.499 --> 01:01.359
the Evil Triad is behind
all of those attacks.

01:01.459 --> 01:03.026
Um, yeah.
I don't need a recap,

01:03.126 --> 01:04.941
but what I do need
is some heat.

01:05.042 --> 01:06.067
Is it freezing in here?

01:06.167 --> 01:07.859
Did you forget
to pay the gas bill?

01:07.959 --> 01:09.067
I... thought that <i>you</i>

01:09.167 --> 01:11.276
were supposed to
pay the gas bill.

01:11.376 --> 01:12.692
No, Prue, I was gonna
take care of the club

01:12.792 --> 01:14.399
and you were gonna
take care of the house,

01:14.499 --> 01:16.276
remember--
when school started

01:16.376 --> 01:17.483
back up for me?
Ooh, right.

01:17.583 --> 01:19.609
Uh, I'll call the gas
company first thing.

01:19.709 --> 01:22.067
I will be so glad
when Piper gets back.

01:22.167 --> 01:23.399
What if she doesn't?

01:23.499 --> 01:24.567
(<i>phone ringing</i>)

01:24.667 --> 01:26.067
Oh, that's my fax.

01:26.167 --> 01:27.192
Doesn't what?

01:27.292 --> 01:30.192
Well, what if she
doesn't come back?

01:30.292 --> 01:32.067
I mean, what if when
her and Leo

01:32.167 --> 01:33.318
orbed out, it was for good?

01:33.418 --> 01:34.984
Phoebe, that is ridiculous.

01:35.084 --> 01:37.067
No, Prue,
it's not ridiculous.

01:37.167 --> 01:37.537
Think about it.

01:37.547 --> 01:39.901
We have not heard
from her in a <i>month,</i>

01:40.001 --> 01:41.318
and that's not like her.

01:41.418 --> 01:42.109
All right, look. Piper

01:42.209 --> 01:43.984
is not just going
to ditch us, okay?

01:44.084 --> 01:46.067
We're her sisters.
And neither is Leo--

01:46.167 --> 01:47.399
he's <i>our</i> whitelighter, too.

01:47.499 --> 01:48.483
Then why hasn't
she contacted us?

01:48.583 --> 01:51.399
I mean, she has to know that
we're worried about her.

01:51.499 --> 01:53.067
She also has to know
that she's left us

01:53.167 --> 01:55.109
one sister short of
the "power of three."

01:55.209 --> 01:58.775
So while she is up romping
around in the clouds with Leo,

01:58.875 --> 02:00.151
we've got our Wiccan butts

02:00.251 --> 02:02.109
flapping around
in the wind here.

02:02.209 --> 02:03.399
I mean,
we are very lucky, Prue,

02:03.499 --> 02:04.734
that we have not
been attacked yet.

02:04.834 --> 02:07.109
No, it has absolutely
nothing to do with luck.

02:07.209 --> 02:08.192
The Triad is up to something.

02:08.292 --> 02:09.692
We just don't know
what it is yet.

02:09.792 --> 02:10.609
That's exactly my point.

02:10.709 --> 02:12.859
Piper knows this,
so where the hell is she?

02:12.959 --> 02:14.650
Well, that's why I've
been studying the book.

02:14.750 --> 02:17.399
Prue, studying the book
is not gonna do it.

02:17.499 --> 02:20.276
We're screwed without
Piper and you know this.

02:20.376 --> 02:21.942
Why aren't you worried?

02:22.042 --> 02:23.026
I <i>am</i> worried.

02:23.126 --> 02:24.276
I-I am scared that
you're right,

02:24.376 --> 02:26.399
that we're never gonna
see her again, and not

02:26.499 --> 02:28.234
because she doesn't
want to come back,

02:28.334 --> 02:29.399
but because <i>they
</i> won't let her,

02:29.499 --> 02:31.859
because she broke
one too many rules.

02:31.959 --> 02:33.067
(<i>phone ringing</i>)

02:33.167 --> 02:35.399
Who's calling us at
2:00 in the morning?

02:35.499 --> 02:37.609
Probably Darryl.

02:37.709 --> 02:38.399
Hello?

02:38.499 --> 02:39.442
DARRYL:
Did you get the fax I sent?

02:39.542 --> 02:42.399
Yeah, I was just about
to check it. Hold on.

02:42.499 --> 02:43.399
What's going on?

02:43.499 --> 02:45.359
Darryl's tracking
a murder suspect

02:45.459 --> 02:47.525
who he thinks is
in league with a demon.

02:47.625 --> 02:48.234
Based on what?

02:48.334 --> 02:49.609
Based on the fact
that the killer

02:49.709 --> 02:52.942
carves a demonic symbol
into its victim's forehead--

02:53.042 --> 02:54.234
an inverted triangle.

02:54.334 --> 02:54.745
That and the fact

02:54.755 --> 02:56.692
that he magically
seems to be evading arrest.

02:56.792 --> 02:57.567
Looks like a rune to me.

02:57.667 --> 03:00.399
Yeah, I saw it
in here somewhere.

03:00.499 --> 03:01.984
Darryl, is he

03:02.084 --> 03:03.234
still at the Pier Street Rave?

03:03.334 --> 03:05.399
Yeah, but I think
he's on the move.

03:05.499 --> 03:07.959
I don't think he spotted me yet.

03:09.001 --> 03:11.167
He's headed
out the back.

03:12.709 --> 03:13.692
PRUE:
There.

03:13.792 --> 03:14.567
"An opening by
which demons,

03:14.667 --> 03:18.609
known as the guardians,
steal an innocent soul."

03:18.709 --> 03:21.525
Stay away from him Darryl.

03:21.625 --> 03:23.525
And let him kill somebody else?
I don't think so.

03:23.625 --> 03:24.859
PRUE:
No, listen to me.

03:24.959 --> 03:26.859
These guardians protect
their mortal killers

03:26.959 --> 03:28.901
in exchange
for their victims' souls.

03:29.001 --> 03:31.151
You cannot stop him.

03:31.251 --> 03:32.525
Listen, Prue,

03:32.625 --> 03:34.901
I can take care of myself.

03:35.001 --> 03:36.399
I gotta call you back.

03:36.499 --> 03:38.359
I'm not sure
where this guy is.

03:38.459 --> 03:39.875
(<i>grunts</i>)

03:40.917 --> 03:41.542
Darryl.

03:42.500 --> 03:44.209
Darryl?

03:47.251 --> 03:49.192
All right, we're
only three minutes away.

03:49.292 --> 03:50.817
What do we do
once we get there?

03:50.917 --> 03:52.109
Try and save Darryl's life.

03:52.209 --> 03:53.079
No, I mean
about the guardian.

03:53.089 --> 03:54.399
We don't even know
how to vanquish it.

03:54.499 --> 03:55.399
Well, the book
says we kill it

03:55.499 --> 03:59.109
just like you would a
vampire-- with a stake.

03:59.209 --> 03:59.901
Oh, okay.

04:00.001 --> 04:02.859
Piper, where are you?

04:02.959 --> 04:07.126
(<i>low, eerie, distorted voices
 speak indistinctly</i>)

04:10.625 --> 04:14.084
(<i>shallow gasping</i>)

04:15.542 --> 04:16.750
(<i>shrieks</i>)

04:20.541 --> 04:22.499
(<i>woman screaming</i>)

04:26.500 --> 04:28.542
No! Please
don't hurt me!

04:34.251 --> 04:37.750
(<i>dance music throbbing</i>)

04:39.251 --> 04:43.084
(<i>eerie voice speaking
indistinctly</i>)

05:04.542 --> 05:06.667
(<i>ragged exhale</i>)

05:14.542 --> 05:19.167
(<i>music blaring</i>)

05:26.499 --> 05:28.126
PRUE:
Darryl...!

05:28.499 --> 05:29.834
PHOEBE:
Prue!

05:41.292 --> 05:41.704
He's alive.

05:41.714 --> 05:44.399
Uh... I think
I found the guardian.

05:44.499 --> 05:46.750
(<i>eerie moaning</i>)

05:47.376 --> 05:48.750
Okay, get rid of it!

05:51.001 --> 05:54.359
Wait, didn't the book say
they were just like vampires?

05:54.459 --> 05:56.151
I might have misread that part.

05:56.251 --> 05:57.499
I'm sorry?

06:02.583 --> 06:02.901
Oh.

06:03.001 --> 06:03.567
Okay, the rune.

06:03.667 --> 06:04.667
Aim for the rune.

06:05.459 --> 06:07.834
(<i>eerie howling</i>)

06:09.292 --> 06:11.750
(<i>howling fades</i>)

06:14.459 --> 06:16.775
Okay, if Piper ever comes back,

06:16.875 --> 06:20.042
I'm going to kill her.

07:46.625 --> 07:48.483
Ready?
Yeah.

07:48.583 --> 07:50.042
Good.

08:00.251 --> 08:00.650
Poor girl.

08:00.750 --> 08:03.817
Do you feel
dizzy at all? Nauseous?

08:03.917 --> 08:04.399
No.

08:04.499 --> 08:06.442
Trouble focusing? Headache?

08:06.542 --> 08:07.567
I'm telling you, I'm fine.

08:07.667 --> 08:09.567
The only thing
wounded is my pride.

08:09.667 --> 08:10.525
<i>Is</i> he fine?

08:10.625 --> 08:13.334
Yeah, thanks to you guys.

08:13.499 --> 08:14.859
What do you mean, thanks to us?

08:14.959 --> 08:18.625
You fought off the
attacker, didn't you?

08:19.750 --> 08:21.151
Isn't that what happened?

08:21.251 --> 08:24.276
Um... Y-yeah. You know,
it wasn't really

08:24.376 --> 08:26.167
that big of a deal.

08:26.499 --> 08:27.400
Well, you saved his life.

08:27.500 --> 08:29.067
I think that's
a pretty big deal.

08:29.167 --> 08:30.901
You're a lucky man,
Inspector.

08:31.001 --> 08:32.567
Take care.

08:32.667 --> 08:33.958
Thanks.

08:36.625 --> 08:38.399
Okay. Can we go now?

08:38.499 --> 08:41.042
No. You have to give
witness statements.

08:41.376 --> 08:41.775
Uh, Darryl...

08:41.875 --> 08:43.984
Prue, you're witnesses
to a crime.

08:44.083 --> 08:45.734
In this case, the
only witnesses.

08:45.834 --> 08:48.192
No, Darryl,
we can't <i>be</i> witnesses.

08:48.292 --> 08:50.151
We used our powers
to stop the killer.

08:50.251 --> 08:51.399
What are we supposed to say?

08:51.499 --> 08:52.399
And he saw us use them, too.

08:52.499 --> 08:54.192
DARRYL:
Nobody's gonna
believe anything that

08:54.292 --> 08:56.026
sleazeball has to say.
All you have to do

08:56.126 --> 08:57.109
is get your story straight.

08:57.209 --> 08:59.276
You mean get our lies straight.

08:59.376 --> 09:00.399
Phoebe,

09:00.499 --> 09:01.399
listen to me.

09:01.499 --> 09:05.499
Without your testimony,
Emilio walks.

09:06.625 --> 09:08.399
(<i>quiet, mocking laugh</i>)

09:08.499 --> 09:11.026
What is he smiling at,
anyway? It's not like he has

09:11.126 --> 09:13.817
his guardian demon
to protect him any more.

09:13.917 --> 09:14.578
And, unfortunately,

09:14.588 --> 09:17.399
our guardian <i>angel</i> is
nowhere to be found.

09:17.499 --> 09:18.442
We could sure use

09:18.542 --> 09:20.026
some cosmic help right now.

09:20.126 --> 09:21.525
Now, what are we supposed to do?

09:21.625 --> 09:23.901
We've never been
in this situation before.

09:24.001 --> 09:26.917
You better decide fast--
here comes the ADA.

09:29.292 --> 09:30.483
Ladies, my name's Cole Turner.

09:30.583 --> 09:32.525
I'm the assistant
district attorney

09:32.625 --> 09:34.234
assigned to this case.

09:34.334 --> 09:37.399
So I was wondering if either
of you saw what happened here?

09:37.499 --> 09:39.209
I did.

09:45.334 --> 09:47.109
I think we've
in good shape except

09:47.209 --> 09:48.067
for the, what'd you call

09:48.167 --> 09:49.984
the murder weapon--
an a-thamme?

09:50.084 --> 09:50.650
Atha-may.

09:50.750 --> 09:53.399
It's a ceremonial
knife used by...

09:53.499 --> 09:56.026
um, lots of different
crazy people.

09:56.126 --> 10:00.399
And you're sure you
didn't see who took it?

10:00.499 --> 10:02.399
No, we were there

10:02.499 --> 10:03.399
to check up on
Darryl and...

10:03.499 --> 10:06.276
Probably just some
lunatic from the rave.

10:06.376 --> 10:07.399
Will it hurt the case?

10:07.499 --> 10:09.109
The PD'll try
to focus on it,

10:09.209 --> 10:10.400
but, this
is just an arraignment.

10:10.500 --> 10:14.251
Unless there's... something
I don't know about...

10:15.583 --> 10:16.609
...we should have
more than enough

10:16.709 --> 10:19.209
for the judge
to hold him over for trial.

10:20.251 --> 10:21.399
Don't worry.

10:21.499 --> 10:22.859
I'm good at what I do.

10:22.959 --> 10:25.499
BAILIFF:
All rise.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.984
Court is now in
session, Honorable

10:29.084 --> 10:30.442
Judge William Hamilton

10:30.542 --> 10:31.567
now presiding.

10:31.667 --> 10:33.418
Please be seated.

10:34.126 --> 10:35.399
I'm nervous.

10:35.499 --> 10:37.399
Oh, you know,
witches and trials.

10:37.499 --> 10:38.609
It's that whole Salem thing.

10:38.709 --> 10:39.609
No, I mean about lying.

10:39.709 --> 10:41.399
It just doesn't
feel right, Prue.

10:41.499 --> 10:43.399
Would it feel
more right to just

10:43.499 --> 10:44.792
let him go?

10:45.625 --> 10:49.400
Case Number B684400,

10:49.500 --> 10:52.525
<i>The State of California
 v. Emilio Smith.</i>

10:52.625 --> 10:54.692
One count of murder
in the first degree,

10:54.792 --> 10:56.109
one count
attempted murder.

10:56.209 --> 10:59.734
Assistant District Attorney
Cole Turner for the State.

10:59.834 --> 11:02.917
Public Defender Alan
Sloan for the defense.

11:03.499 --> 11:05.399
How does the defendant plead?

11:05.499 --> 11:07.151
Not guilty, Your Honor.

11:07.251 --> 11:08.399
So noted.

11:08.499 --> 11:09.859
Mr. Turner, I've
read your brief.

11:09.959 --> 11:11.234
Do you have anything to add?

11:11.334 --> 11:12.318
No, Your Honor, the State

11:12.418 --> 11:15.901
stands by the arrest report
and the eyewitness testimonies.

11:16.001 --> 11:16.734
Mr. Sloan.

11:16.834 --> 11:19.442
Well, uh, it seems
to me, Your Honor,

11:19.542 --> 11:22.318
you can't very well
hold for a murder trial

11:22.418 --> 11:23.318
without a murder weapon.

11:23.418 --> 11:24.399
The State has already stipulated

11:24.499 --> 11:27.609
that the alleged murder
weapon was still outstanding.

11:27.709 --> 11:29.151
We have two eyewitnesses...

11:29.251 --> 11:30.792
...who saw what exactly?

11:31.251 --> 11:33.942
My client
bent over the inspector?

11:34.042 --> 11:35.399
That's how they
justify their attack?

11:35.499 --> 11:39.859
How did they know he didn't
just happen across the scene

11:39.959 --> 11:41.650
and was trying
to revive the inspector?

11:41.750 --> 11:43.442
Oh, please!

11:43.542 --> 11:45.192
(<i>gavel pounds</i>)
Order!

11:45.292 --> 11:46.318
Sorry.

11:46.418 --> 11:46.859
And why,

11:46.959 --> 11:48.734
if they were able
to so easily subdue him,

11:48.834 --> 11:50.609
don't they know
exactly what happened

11:50.709 --> 11:51.734
to the alleged
weapon?

11:51.834 --> 11:53.026
I mean, what, did it just--

11:53.126 --> 11:54.859
poof!-- magically disappear?

11:54.959 --> 11:55.609
COLE:
Objection.

11:55.709 --> 11:57.276
Oh, God, he knows.
Easy.

11:57.376 --> 12:00.026
Your Honor, the witnesses
aren't on trial here.
Why?

12:00.126 --> 12:01.359
Isn't perjury illegal?

12:01.459 --> 12:03.418
Objection, Your Honor!

12:03.834 --> 12:04.817
Mr. Turner, unless you have

12:04.917 --> 12:08.399
something else or can produce
the alleged murder weapon,

12:08.499 --> 12:11.499
I'm inclined
to agree with Mr. Sloan.

12:12.209 --> 12:12.495
You're what?

12:12.505 --> 12:16.084
Do you or don't you have
any additional evidence?

12:18.167 --> 12:19.037
You mean aside from the fact

12:19.047 --> 12:21.734
that he's the prime suspect
in three other murders,

12:21.834 --> 12:22.734
that no less than five people

12:22.834 --> 12:24.901
saw him leave the rave
just before the attack

12:25.001 --> 12:27.026
and that everything,
other than the missing

12:27.126 --> 12:30.625
murder weapon, makes this in any
other courtroom a slam dunk!?

12:32.667 --> 12:34.775
The charges are dropped.

12:34.875 --> 12:36.234
The defendant
is released.

12:36.334 --> 12:36.870
(<i>gavel pounds</i>)

12:36.880 --> 12:38.399
MAN (<i>quietly</i>):
...just let him go?

12:38.499 --> 12:40.625
I don't believe this.

12:40.959 --> 12:43.459
JUDGE:
Clerk, next case.

12:44.459 --> 12:44.745
Yeah, you keep

12:44.755 --> 12:47.359
smiling, punk. I'm not giving up
until I see you fry.

12:47.459 --> 12:51.209
Come on, Turner. This isn't
gonna solve anything.

12:51.625 --> 12:53.209
SLOAN:
Let's go.

12:55.292 --> 12:56.499
Let's go.

12:59.499 --> 13:00.359
I'm so sorry.

13:00.459 --> 13:01.859
I wish that there
was more

13:01.959 --> 13:02.537
that we could do.

13:02.547 --> 13:04.984
Is there's something
you're not telling me--

13:05.084 --> 13:05.901
anything.

13:06.001 --> 13:08.399
If you're afraid of him,
we can protect you.

13:08.499 --> 13:09.399
I can re-file.

13:09.499 --> 13:10.399
(<i>clearing throat</i>)

13:10.499 --> 13:12.499
We have to go. Sorry.

13:21.084 --> 13:23.067
We shouldn't have lied.

13:23.167 --> 13:23.942
Phoebe...

13:24.042 --> 13:24.692
We shouldn't have.

13:24.792 --> 13:26.234
We should have told the truth.

13:26.334 --> 13:27.234
We should have done whatever

13:27.334 --> 13:29.109
we had to do to keep
that jerk from walking.

13:29.209 --> 13:31.859
Like what? Say what
really happened to that knife?

13:31.959 --> 13:34.026
Tell the court
that we're witches?

13:34.126 --> 13:34.530
Why not, Prue?

13:34.630 --> 13:36.359
Isn't it more important
to keep a killer

13:36.459 --> 13:38.399
off the streets than
to protect our secret?

13:38.499 --> 13:39.609
Phoebe, the judge would
have thought

13:39.709 --> 13:40.859
that we were nuts
and you know it.

13:40.959 --> 13:42.442
Not if you would have
proved it to him

13:42.542 --> 13:43.399
and showed him
your power.

13:43.499 --> 13:45.151
No, that wouldn't have put
Emilio away,

13:45.251 --> 13:46.359
that would have put us away.

13:46.459 --> 13:47.399
And then we would never have

13:47.499 --> 13:48.734
the chance
of catching him again.

13:48.834 --> 13:51.399
And would that be before
or after

13:51.499 --> 13:52.984
he kills
somebody else?

13:53.084 --> 13:53.734
I'm sorry.

13:53.834 --> 13:54.692
You know, I'm just...

13:54.792 --> 13:57.109
I'm really frustrated
about all this.

13:57.209 --> 13:58.609
What about that
public defender?

13:58.709 --> 14:01.901
I mean, if Emilio really did
tell that PD about us,

14:02.001 --> 14:04.399
then why didn't he spill
the magic beans?

14:04.499 --> 14:05.525
Same reason as us,
credibility.

14:05.625 --> 14:08.901
What I'm curious about
is, is he mortal
or is he demon?

14:09.001 --> 14:11.234
All I know is Cole is an angel.

14:11.334 --> 14:15.234
He was awesome in
that courtroom yesterday.

14:15.334 --> 14:17.192
See something you like, sis?

14:17.292 --> 14:17.494
Maybe.

14:17.504 --> 14:21.567
Or maybe it's just nice
to run into someone

14:21.667 --> 14:23.942
that's not a college boy.

14:24.042 --> 14:25.650
More years,
less hormones.

14:25.750 --> 14:27.817
Yeah, not a bad butt either.

14:27.917 --> 14:28.537
(<i>eerie whooshing</i>)

14:28.547 --> 14:29.775
PIPER:
We've been through this, Leo.

14:29.875 --> 14:30.609
I don't care what they are.

14:30.709 --> 14:32.859
It's not right
and it's not fair.

14:32.959 --> 14:34.650
LEO:
I know that,
but it's their rules.

14:34.750 --> 14:35.442
Screw their rules!

14:35.542 --> 14:37.609
PIPER:
They're wrong!
Piper...

14:37.709 --> 14:38.399
Just a second.

14:38.499 --> 14:39.318
Leo, you better

14:39.418 --> 14:40.151
do something
about this

14:40.251 --> 14:41.442
because this
is not acceptable.

14:41.542 --> 14:42.399
Piper, come on!

14:42.499 --> 14:43.234
(<i>grunts</i>)

14:43.334 --> 14:45.567
I'm going to go
to the club.

14:45.667 --> 14:47.292
Do not tell him.

14:49.709 --> 14:50.399
Hi, welcome home.

14:50.499 --> 14:51.734
Okay, what was
that all about?

14:51.834 --> 14:53.442
I didn't even get
to bitch at her.

14:53.542 --> 14:54.817
Yeah, neither did I, but...

14:54.917 --> 14:56.875
...we have to talk about it.

14:58.459 --> 14:59.792
Leo, she left.

15:00.459 --> 15:01.399
Yeah, so now I get
to bitch at you.

15:01.499 --> 15:04.399
Listen, the next time you take
my sister someplace, please call

15:04.499 --> 15:06.400
and let us know that
you got there safely, okay?

15:06.500 --> 15:08.276
I don't care if it's up there...

15:08.376 --> 15:10.692
Shh, shh.

15:10.792 --> 15:11.567
Leo, uh...

15:11.667 --> 15:12.942
can you do me
a favor

15:13.042 --> 15:15.942
and just go find out
everything you can
on guardians?

15:16.042 --> 15:17.109
They are demons, okay?

15:17.209 --> 15:18.542
Thank you. Bye.

15:21.583 --> 15:23.734
Excuse me but
I have issues.

15:23.834 --> 15:25.026
Yes, I know, so do I,

15:25.126 --> 15:28.234
but Leo looked pretty
beaten up already.

15:28.334 --> 15:28.912
Yeah, you're right.

15:28.922 --> 15:32.859
Which is why I am now
gonna go kick Piper's ass.

15:32.959 --> 15:34.667
Oh! Oh!

15:35.625 --> 15:37.067
Okay, we have had
this conversation.

15:37.167 --> 15:39.399
You are not allowed to use
your active power on me

15:39.499 --> 15:42.109
until I have an active power
to use on you, remember?

15:42.209 --> 15:43.109
I know, and I'm sorry,
all right?

15:43.209 --> 15:46.650
But if anybody is going to talk
to Piper, it should be me, okay?

15:46.750 --> 15:48.192
Cooler heads and all.

15:48.292 --> 15:51.109
Besides, shouldn't
you be at class?

15:51.209 --> 15:54.792
(<i>frustrated sigh</i>)

15:58.959 --> 16:00.318
Piper?

16:00.418 --> 16:02.359
This is really weird.

16:02.459 --> 16:03.399
My supplies

16:03.499 --> 16:04.400
are like gone.

16:04.500 --> 16:05.399
There's no booze,

16:05.499 --> 16:06.399
there's no mineral water,

16:06.499 --> 16:07.692
and we're even out of pretzels.

16:07.792 --> 16:09.399
Plus the books are
all messed up.

16:09.499 --> 16:11.399
How did this happen
in one lousy day?

16:11.499 --> 16:13.625
One day--
you're kidding, right?

16:14.499 --> 16:15.399
Piper,

16:15.499 --> 16:17.609
you have been gone
for one <i>month.</i>

16:17.709 --> 16:19.692
What are you
talking about?

16:19.792 --> 16:21.499
Here...

16:21.834 --> 16:22.775
...check the date.

16:22.875 --> 16:27.251
October. It's October?
How is this possible?

16:27.542 --> 16:28.359
I guess time moves

16:28.459 --> 16:30.234
a little bit differently
up there.

16:30.334 --> 16:32.026
Yeah well, it doesn't
keep your head

16:32.126 --> 16:33.442
from being bitten off
down here.

16:33.542 --> 16:34.399
Are you talking about demons?

16:34.499 --> 16:39.942
Oh, no, something so much worse
than demons-- sisters.

16:40.042 --> 16:41.318
Especially Phoebe.

16:41.418 --> 16:42.984
We thought that you
had abandoned us.

16:43.084 --> 16:43.734
That's ridiculous.

16:43.834 --> 16:45.359
I would never abandon you guys.

16:45.459 --> 16:47.399
If I had known I was
gone this long,

16:47.499 --> 16:48.525
I would've called or orbed

16:48.625 --> 16:50.650
or somehow let you know
I was okay.

16:50.750 --> 16:51.692
Okay, so why didn't Leo?

16:51.792 --> 16:56.084
Leo was battling demons
of his own.

16:56.499 --> 16:58.151
Wait a minute, what's today?

16:58.251 --> 16:58.537
There's a band.

16:58.547 --> 17:01.567
The-the-the Barenaked Ladies
is playing here tomorrow.

17:01.667 --> 17:03.234
Did anybody bother
to call them?

17:03.334 --> 17:05.398
I don't really think
that Phoebe knew.

17:05.499 --> 17:06.567
You know what, Piper,

17:06.666 --> 17:11.398
can we just talk about what
happened up there first?

17:11.499 --> 17:11.817
Sure.

17:11.916 --> 17:13.650
Uh, unfortunately,
the longer I'm back,

17:13.750 --> 17:15.192
the fuzzier it all seems to get.

17:15.291 --> 17:16.567
I think they do that on purpose.

17:16.666 --> 17:17.942
They're very big
on mystery.

17:18.041 --> 17:19.567
Okay, do you remember anything?

17:19.666 --> 17:20.398
Just feelings, mostly.

17:20.499 --> 17:24.276
Good ones, peaceful and whole,
and then it all went to crap

17:24.376 --> 17:29.318
when they said Leo and I had to
stop seeing each other or else.

17:29.418 --> 17:30.942
Or else what?

17:31.042 --> 17:33.067
Or else they'd reassign him

17:33.167 --> 17:36.917
and we'd never
see each other again.

17:37.334 --> 17:38.609
Just because it didn't work out

17:38.709 --> 17:39.901
with Mom and her whitelighter,

17:40.001 --> 17:41.525
I don't understand
why I'm being punished.

17:41.625 --> 17:45.750
I'm sure that you guys will
figure out a way around this.

17:47.292 --> 17:48.650
Come here.

17:48.750 --> 17:49.859
Leo would never

17:49.959 --> 17:51.942
let you go without a fight,
you know that.

17:52.042 --> 17:55.499
But what if he doesn't
have a choice?

18:05.251 --> 18:06.399
(<i>karate yell</i>)

18:06.499 --> 18:07.875
Oh... oh...

18:08.667 --> 18:09.775
Cole.

18:09.875 --> 18:12.399
Hi. How's it going?

18:12.499 --> 18:14.276
Oh... (<i>chuckles</i>)

18:14.376 --> 18:17.359
Wow, is this embarrassing.

18:17.459 --> 18:18.399
Uh, I-I'm...

18:18.499 --> 18:20.792
It's okay, I'm okay.

18:21.709 --> 18:22.525
Nice calf.

18:22.625 --> 18:25.499
Oh... thanks.

18:25.917 --> 18:27.442
Can I have it back?

18:27.542 --> 18:28.400
Sure. Sure.

18:28.500 --> 18:29.400
(<i>laughing</i>):
Okay.

18:29.500 --> 18:31.483
Uh... how did you find me?

18:31.583 --> 18:34.109
Told you I was good
at what I do.

18:34.209 --> 18:34.775
(<i>laughs</i>)

18:34.875 --> 18:36.234
Although you probably

18:36.334 --> 18:37.109
wouldn't think so

18:37.209 --> 18:38.984
after my performance in court.

18:39.084 --> 18:41.399
No, I thought you were amazing.

18:41.499 --> 18:45.500
It's just you were up against
a, uh...

18:46.001 --> 18:47.234
...an unfair judge.

18:47.334 --> 18:49.276
Free Willy--
he's got that reputation.

18:49.376 --> 18:51.359
Still, I know I didn't
put on my best case.

18:51.459 --> 18:55.734
That's why I'm here-- to see if
you can help me do a better job.

18:55.834 --> 18:57.525
How?

18:57.625 --> 18:59.318
I don't know.

18:59.418 --> 19:01.334
You tell me.

19:02.209 --> 19:07.942
Look, Phoebe, I may not be
the greatest prosecutor,

19:08.042 --> 19:10.234
but I've got good instincts.

19:10.334 --> 19:11.609
I can sense things about people;

19:11.709 --> 19:13.483
things they may not even
want me to know.

19:13.583 --> 19:16.359
And what do you sense about me?

19:16.459 --> 19:20.001
That you're struggling
with the truth.

19:20.750 --> 19:21.537
That you're a good person

19:21.547 --> 19:23.399
who wants to do
the right thing here but,

19:23.499 --> 19:25.499
for whatever reason, can't.

19:27.251 --> 19:28.959
How am I doing so far?

19:30.500 --> 19:32.399
Hung jury.

19:32.499 --> 19:33.399
Mistrial.

19:33.499 --> 19:39.192
(<i>bell tolling in distance</i>)

19:39.292 --> 19:41.376
If you think of anything...

19:43.500 --> 19:44.609
...please call me.

19:44.709 --> 19:47.334
Home number's on the back.

19:48.418 --> 19:50.500
Bye.

20:03.459 --> 20:05.499
Oh, no.

20:10.583 --> 20:12.734
I have got to get
a cell phone.

20:12.834 --> 20:14.026
Prue, I had a premonition

20:14.126 --> 20:17.609
of Emilio carving that rune
into Cole's forehead.

20:17.709 --> 20:18.578
Did you see where it happens?

20:18.588 --> 20:20.692
No, just some parking lot
somewhere.

20:20.792 --> 20:21.400
Who's Cole?

20:21.500 --> 20:23.692
What did you do to your hair?

20:23.792 --> 20:24.775
I'm sorry, do I know you?

20:24.875 --> 20:26.483
Uh, Phoebe, now
is not the time.

20:26.583 --> 20:27.399
Are you sure?

20:27.499 --> 20:27.870
Yeah, positive.

20:27.880 --> 20:29.817
Although, now that I think
about it, it does seem weird,

20:29.917 --> 20:31.151
because we vanquished
the guardian.

20:31.251 --> 20:32.109
Well, maybe he got another one.

20:32.209 --> 20:34.109
PHOEBE:
What's a guardian,
you ask?

20:34.209 --> 20:36.399
Well, if you'd been around
at all,

20:36.499 --> 20:38.026
then you'd probably
know, huh?

20:38.126 --> 20:39.817
All right, we'll fill you in
on the phone,

20:39.917 --> 20:41.109
and Leo's
checking on them

20:41.209 --> 20:42.399
so you should
get together with him

20:42.499 --> 20:43.442
and find out everything.

20:43.542 --> 20:44.959
And no orbing.

20:56.499 --> 20:57.984
I need another guardian.

20:58.084 --> 21:00.399
What you need is to be
more careful.

21:00.499 --> 21:02.276
I won't protect you again.

21:02.376 --> 21:03.525
I won't get caught again.

21:03.625 --> 21:06.400
I can take care
of the witches, Judge.

21:06.500 --> 21:07.692
No, you can't.

21:07.792 --> 21:09.709
You're mortal.

21:10.334 --> 21:13.499
But you can take care
of the prosecutor.

21:16.625 --> 21:20.251
I don't want him to find out
about you...

21:20.917 --> 21:23.126
...or me, understand?

21:25.418 --> 21:26.399
I wish I could help you, Turner,

21:26.499 --> 21:28.109
but I've told you
everything I can.

21:28.209 --> 21:28.495
Call me Cole.

21:28.505 --> 21:30.399
After all, we're on
the same side, aren't we?

21:30.499 --> 21:32.359
As often as cops and
DA's are, I guess.

21:32.459 --> 21:35.567
Look, Inspector, I'm just trying
to do my job, okay?

21:35.667 --> 21:37.399
I let a murderer go free today

21:37.499 --> 21:39.734
and that doesn't
sit well with me.

21:39.834 --> 21:41.442
Me neither.

21:41.542 --> 21:42.859
Then help me do
something about it.

21:42.959 --> 21:45.399
Help me find out what it is
that I'm missing here.

21:45.499 --> 21:47.442
What you're missing
is a suspect.

21:47.542 --> 21:48.901
And if you let me
do my job,

21:49.001 --> 21:51.399
maybe I can help you
find him again.

21:51.499 --> 21:52.817
Now if you'll excuse me.

21:52.917 --> 21:56.459
Why'd you call the
Halliwells last night?

21:57.750 --> 21:59.109
What?

21:59.209 --> 22:00.525
While you were on stakeout,

22:00.625 --> 22:04.192
at 2:17 a.m.-- according
to the phone company.

22:04.292 --> 22:06.650
You checked up on me?

22:06.750 --> 22:08.151
Standard procedure, Inspector.

22:08.251 --> 22:11.318
Gee, and here I thought
we were on the same side.

22:11.418 --> 22:13.483
I called because
the sisters own a club.

22:13.583 --> 22:15.775
I thought they'd be interested

22:15.875 --> 22:17.399
in checking out the rave.

22:17.499 --> 22:19.399
That was very nice of you.

22:19.499 --> 22:21.399
I'm a nice guy.

22:21.499 --> 22:22.399
Yeah.

22:22.499 --> 22:23.959
(<i>phone rings</i>)

22:26.376 --> 22:27.192
Turner.

SECRETARY:
It's Phoebe Halliwell.
Speak of the devil.

22:29.583 --> 22:31.650
Can I take a message?
No, please put her through.

22:31.750 --> 22:32.359
Phoebe?

22:32.459 --> 22:34.650
Cole, good. I've been
trying to reach you.

22:34.750 --> 22:37.692
Sorry, I was in a meeting--
with Inspector Morris, actually.

22:37.792 --> 22:39.026
Want to say hello?

22:39.126 --> 22:39.609
Uh, no.

22:39.709 --> 22:40.942
He's at
the police station.

22:41.042 --> 22:42.109
Ten, 15 minutes
at least.

22:42.209 --> 22:44.399
Listen, Cole,
I need to talk to you.

22:44.499 --> 22:46.399
It's really
really important.

22:46.499 --> 22:48.399
Say again.
I didn't catch that.

22:48.499 --> 22:48.704
Cole?

22:48.714 --> 22:50.609
You know, just stay where
you are, and...

22:50.709 --> 22:53.359
(<i>breaking up</i>):
...me... you there, okay.

22:53.459 --> 22:54.026
We've got a bad line.

22:54.126 --> 22:55.567
Look, I'm running
late for court.

22:55.667 --> 22:57.276
I'll call you from my car.

22:57.376 --> 22:58.817
Cole?

22:58.917 --> 23:01.499

Cole. Cole.

What are you doing here?

24:48.959 --> 24:50.109
What happened?

24:50.209 --> 24:53.834
I think I'm going to plead
the Fifth on that one.

25:00.499 --> 25:01.984
LEO:
I look at you

25:02.084 --> 25:04.942
and I think
how lucky I am.

25:05.042 --> 25:08.151
I mean, I can't stop
looking at you.

25:08.251 --> 25:10.400
You're my dream
come true.

25:10.500 --> 25:12.442
You're my raison d'Ãªtre.

25:12.542 --> 25:16.734
Every time I see you,
I love you even more.

25:16.834 --> 25:18.942
You're so beautiful.

25:19.042 --> 25:21.817
You're so special.

25:21.917 --> 25:25.001
I can't imagine
my life without you.

25:25.834 --> 25:26.901
Piper!

25:27.001 --> 25:27.650
Leo...

25:27.750 --> 25:28.734
who are you talking to?

25:28.834 --> 25:32.276
Me? Uh, nobody.
Just myself, you know?

25:32.376 --> 25:33.026
Yourself?

25:33.126 --> 25:35.984
You were telling yourself
how much you love you?

25:36.084 --> 25:37.399
No, of course not.

25:37.499 --> 25:38.483
Uh, I mean, it's...

25:38.583 --> 25:39.399
(<i>chuckles</i>)

25:39.499 --> 25:41.276
It's not like that at all.

25:41.376 --> 25:42.399
Um...

25:42.499 --> 25:44.399
let's go downstairs

25:44.499 --> 25:45.400
and I'll explain.

25:45.500 --> 25:47.692
Actually, no, we
don't have time.

25:47.792 --> 25:51.276
Uh, did you find out anything
about the guardians?

25:51.376 --> 25:53.483
Uh, no, I forgot.

25:53.583 --> 25:55.499
You forgot?!

25:56.126 --> 25:56.901
Leo, what's the matter?

25:57.001 --> 25:57.984
Why are you acting so weird?

25:58.084 --> 26:00.734
Can we go downstairs, please?

26:00.834 --> 26:02.276
No. Why?

26:02.376 --> 26:03.609
Okay, fine.

26:03.709 --> 26:05.234
Um, here's good.

26:05.334 --> 26:07.525
Um, I've been
thinking a lot,

26:07.625 --> 26:10.109
actually, about our situation.

26:10.209 --> 26:10.609
Leo...

26:10.709 --> 26:11.483
No, just...

26:11.583 --> 26:12.400
now let me finish.

26:12.500 --> 26:14.734
Um, I think I've come up

26:14.834 --> 26:16.399
with a solution,
a way for us

26:16.499 --> 26:21.399
to be together,
no matter what they say.

26:21.499 --> 26:23.318
(<i>sighs</i>)

26:23.418 --> 26:25.499
Okay.

26:29.875 --> 26:31.709
Will you marry me?

26:40.667 --> 26:41.399
LEO:
Piper?!

26:41.499 --> 26:42.775
This is so not happening.

26:42.875 --> 26:43.494
Listen to me, Piper.

26:43.504 --> 26:46.192
I told you, I thought
this whole thing through.

26:46.292 --> 26:46.859
Uh-huh.

26:46.959 --> 26:49.817
Is that why you asked me
to marry you in a toilet?

26:49.917 --> 26:51.318
I tried to get
you downstairs.

26:51.418 --> 26:52.942
Well, I'm downstairs now,

26:53.042 --> 26:54.817
and I still don't
believe you're serious.

26:54.917 --> 26:56.650
I am serious, Piper--
dead serious.

26:56.750 --> 26:59.399
Right-- dead is exactly
what we're gonna be

26:59.499 --> 27:01.583
if they ever find out.

27:02.499 --> 27:03.399
Piper, would you...

27:03.499 --> 27:05.442
would you just stop
running away from me

27:05.542 --> 27:08.499
for one minute and
let me explain?

27:09.418 --> 27:10.399
If we got married...

27:10.499 --> 27:11.192
(<i>inhales deeply</i>)

27:11.292 --> 27:13.834
Look, will you just
hear me out, please?

27:15.418 --> 27:16.399
If we got married,

27:16.499 --> 27:18.026
it would be a holy union.

27:18.126 --> 27:18.817
Something I don't

27:18.917 --> 27:21.399
even think my bosses
could break apart.

27:21.499 --> 27:23.234
I don't understand.

27:23.334 --> 27:24.121
It's really hard to explain.

27:24.131 --> 27:26.359
I-I don't really understand
how it all works myself.

27:26.459 --> 27:29.400
But I know that there are
different levels up there.

27:29.500 --> 27:31.442
A hierarchy.

27:31.542 --> 27:32.400
What I'm trying to say

27:32.500 --> 27:36.026
is that I think a holy union
goes above their heads.

27:36.126 --> 27:38.109
It'd be like running
an end run

27:38.209 --> 27:39.775
to my bosses'
bosses.

27:39.875 --> 27:41.525
An end run?

27:41.625 --> 27:43.734
Yeah, the only catch
is that we would have

27:43.834 --> 27:44.578
to get married in secret,

27:44.588 --> 27:46.775
because I think the only
way they could hurt us

27:46.875 --> 27:47.775
is if they found
out before,

27:47.875 --> 27:50.650
so we just
have to keep it quiet.

27:50.750 --> 27:52.734
Elope.

27:52.834 --> 27:54.901
Right.
So that they don't find out.

27:55.001 --> 27:56.292
Exactly.

27:57.001 --> 27:57.817
You hate the idea.

27:57.917 --> 28:02.692
Well, it's not exactly
Cinderella,

28:02.792 --> 28:03.399
is it?

28:03.499 --> 28:06.067
Leo, look, how do we know
they don't know already?

28:06.167 --> 28:08.399
How do we know they're
not listening right now?

28:08.499 --> 28:10.399
They're not, believe me.
They don't do that.

28:10.499 --> 28:13.318
So, then, why does it
have to be a secret?

28:13.418 --> 28:16.542
Because if they ever
did find out...

28:20.376 --> 28:25.084
Leo... this isn't
supposed to be this way.

28:25.209 --> 28:29.399
Marriage shouldn't be a solution
to a problem or a Band-Aid.

28:29.499 --> 28:32.942
It's supposed to be about love
and about two people

28:33.042 --> 28:34.026
who love each other so much

28:34.126 --> 28:36.901
they want to spend the rest
of their lives together.

28:37.001 --> 28:37.775
That's what I want.

28:37.875 --> 28:40.859
But that's not
where this is coming from.

28:40.959 --> 28:45.650
It's a fix-it, I guess,
but it's not about us or love

28:45.750 --> 28:48.067
or whether or not we're
even ready to be married.

28:48.167 --> 28:51.734
I came up with this whole idea
because we love each other.

28:51.834 --> 28:55.399
It's all about
our love.

28:55.499 --> 28:57.901
You know, we're meant
to be together, Piper.

28:58.001 --> 28:58.734
You know that.

28:58.834 --> 29:02.359
You went to the future and you
saw that we were married in it.

29:02.459 --> 29:04.399
That means that somehow
they didn't stop us.

29:04.499 --> 29:07.692
Somehow, we found a
way to be together,

29:07.792 --> 29:09.792
and I think this is the way.

29:11.499 --> 29:13.001
I don't know.

29:14.418 --> 29:16.609
Leo... I love you

29:16.709 --> 29:20.609
and I know I don't ever want
to be without you, but...

29:20.709 --> 29:23.399
this just doesn't feel right.

29:23.499 --> 29:25.609
I mean,
getting married

29:25.709 --> 29:27.400
in secret...

29:27.500 --> 29:29.399
(<i>sighs</i>)

29:29.499 --> 29:34.042
It doesn't feel
like a holy union to me.

29:35.499 --> 29:38.875
I'm sorry.

29:40.499 --> 29:41.318

29:43.834 --> 29:44.442
Oh, hey, Leo, good.

29:44.542 --> 29:47.109
Uh, did you find out anything

mean not yet?

I'll go see what I can find out.

30:11.583 --> 30:13.151
You get anything
out of him?

30:13.251 --> 30:14.942
Nope. He's not talking.

30:15.042 --> 30:18.292
Yeah?
Seems to be an epidemic.

30:21.209 --> 30:22.817
Don't do anything
stupid, Turner.

30:22.917 --> 30:25.026
You don't want
to compromise our case.

30:25.126 --> 30:25.483
What case?

30:25.583 --> 30:27.276
He's already gotten
away with murder.

30:27.376 --> 30:29.399
You really think
they're gonna nail him

30:29.499 --> 30:31.792
for hitting me
over the head?

30:40.499 --> 30:41.483
(<i>clears throat</i>)

you'll jump at.

Obviously,
whoever's protecting you

30:51.667 --> 30:53.400
isn't gonna
keep doing it for much longer,

30:53.500 --> 30:56.609
especially since you keep
screwing up and getting caught,

30:56.709 --> 30:58.399
so...

30:58.499 --> 31:00.959
you might want to pay attention.

31:10.499 --> 31:14.399
Tell him
I know he sent you after me,

31:14.499 --> 31:15.901
and because of that,

31:16.001 --> 31:20.334
I'm gonna personally
bring him down.

31:22.625 --> 31:25.399
You don't scare me.

31:25.499 --> 31:27.709
No?

31:29.583 --> 31:31.399
Turner!
(<i>gasping</i>)

31:31.499 --> 31:33.400
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

31:33.500 --> 31:34.399
What the hell you doing?

31:34.499 --> 31:35.750
Let him go!

31:41.084 --> 31:42.499
See you in court.

31:49.499 --> 31:51.499
(<i>knocking</i>)

31:54.334 --> 31:55.109
Hey!

31:55.209 --> 31:57.276
Do you want
to be alone?

31:57.376 --> 31:57.954
(<i>weak chuckle</i>)

31:57.964 --> 32:01.692
No, but it looks
like I'm gonna be.

32:01.792 --> 32:05.650
Leo asked me to marry him.

32:05.750 --> 32:06.525
(<i>playful shriek</i>)

32:06.625 --> 32:07.400
That's great.

32:07.500 --> 32:09.692
Yeah, except that I can't do it.

32:09.792 --> 32:12.859
Uh, what do you mean
you can't do it, Piper?

32:12.959 --> 32:13.609
You love him.

32:13.709 --> 32:15.483
Of course I do,
with all my heart,

32:15.583 --> 32:17.817
but why has it gotta be
so complicated?

32:17.917 --> 32:20.234
Why can't I just be
a normal person

32:20.334 --> 32:22.418
in love with a normal guy?

32:22.542 --> 32:24.399
Does Leo think
that getting married

32:24.499 --> 32:26.318
is the only way around them?

32:26.418 --> 32:26.775
Yeah.

32:26.875 --> 32:29.067
But he's not even
sure it's gonna work.

32:29.167 --> 32:31.459
Yeah, but it might work.

32:31.959 --> 32:32.775
Piper, you and Leo

32:32.875 --> 32:34.567
are destined to be together.

32:34.667 --> 32:37.442
You guys have the kind
of love that girls

32:37.542 --> 32:38.276
dream about.

32:38.376 --> 32:40.399
I know I dream about it.
How 'bout you?

32:40.499 --> 32:41.750
All the time.

32:42.292 --> 32:43.817
PHOEBE:
And I understand
the risks,

32:43.917 --> 32:48.042
but if you don't go for it,
isn't it even a bigger risk?

32:50.418 --> 32:52.418
That was fast.

32:53.126 --> 32:53.734
A little too fast.

32:53.834 --> 32:55.442
Sorry, but they
were very interested

32:55.542 --> 32:56.734
when I told them
about the guardians.

32:56.834 --> 33:00.234
Apparently, guardians help
mortal criminals spread evil.

33:00.334 --> 33:02.109
Yeah, we already
know that-- skip ahead.

33:02.209 --> 33:04.276
Well, they think that you've
stumbled across

33:04.376 --> 33:05.859
some evil conspiracy
in that courtroom,

33:05.959 --> 33:09.442
one where an upper-level demon
somehow assigns guardians

33:09.542 --> 33:11.109
to the criminals
who are set free.

33:11.209 --> 33:13.817
Well, that makes sense--
it explains why

33:13.917 --> 33:14.609
Emilio has two.

33:14.709 --> 33:17.418
Yeah, the question is,
who's the demon?

33:17.792 --> 33:18.399
Didn't you say

33:18.499 --> 33:19.775
the public defender
seemed suspicious?

33:19.875 --> 33:22.151
Yeah, but he's not exactly
in the best position

33:22.251 --> 33:23.399
to be setting criminals free.

33:23.499 --> 33:26.399
Yeah, but Free Willy is.

33:26.499 --> 33:27.026
Who?

33:27.126 --> 33:27.483
The judge.

33:27.583 --> 33:29.567
I mean, that would
explain why he's got

33:29.667 --> 33:30.483
the highest
release rate

33:30.583 --> 33:31.399
of anyone
on the bench.

33:31.499 --> 33:33.400
Well, still, you can't very well
go vanquishing a judge

33:33.500 --> 33:35.234
without knowing for sure
he's demonic.

33:35.334 --> 33:36.984
Well, we better
come up with a plan,

33:37.084 --> 33:40.234
because Emilio gets arraigned
in night court in...

33:40.334 --> 33:42.251
oh, an hour.

33:42.792 --> 33:44.500
I've got an idea.

33:48.418 --> 33:49.399
PIPER:
<i>Can't we just</i>

33:49.499 --> 33:51.318
come up with
a spell or something?

33:51.418 --> 33:53.483
No, a spell could
backfire on us.

33:53.583 --> 33:54.399
So could this.

33:54.499 --> 33:56.026
No, the worst
that could happen

33:56.126 --> 33:57.567
is that it just
doesn't work,

33:57.667 --> 33:59.609
but we have to flush
the demon out somehow.

33:59.709 --> 34:01.734
And since you can
selectively freeze things,

34:01.834 --> 34:02.859
why not just
the innocents?

34:02.959 --> 34:05.109
Oh, maybe 'cause I've
never done it before.

34:05.209 --> 34:07.359
Yeah, well, I've never
levitated before.

34:07.459 --> 34:08.318
You never <i>what?!</i>

34:08.418 --> 34:09.399
PRUE:
Look, Piper,

34:09.498 --> 34:10.984
just focus all of your energy

34:11.083 --> 34:13.234
on freezing the innocents, okay?

34:13.333 --> 34:13.817
Okay.

34:13.917 --> 34:15.900
So why'd you do that
to your hair?

34:16.001 --> 34:18.400
Because I wanted
to change my luck.

34:18.500 --> 34:19.483
Oh.
Scoot!

34:19.583 --> 34:21.234
SLOAN:
How many times is
the prosecution

34:21.333 --> 34:24.942
gonna keep harassing
my client, Your Honor?

34:25.042 --> 34:26.025
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,

34:26.126 --> 34:27.775
this is turning into
nothing but a witch hunt.

34:27.875 --> 34:28.817
COLE:
If it may please
the court,

34:28.917 --> 34:31.359
could I have a minute
to confer with the witnesses?

34:31.458 --> 34:32.400
It's late, Mr. Turner.

34:32.500 --> 34:36.498
Either you have a case
or you don't.

34:39.167 --> 34:39.692
Very well.

34:39.792 --> 34:41.399
Uh, why would
the defendant attack me

34:41.498 --> 34:43.192
if he was innocent
of the prior charges?

34:43.292 --> 34:45.692
There's no proof he's the one
responsible for the attack.

34:45.792 --> 34:46.234
Now, Piper.

34:46.333 --> 34:48.399
COLE:
Then what was he doing
in the police parking lot?

34:48.498 --> 34:50.025
And why did myself
and two eyewitnesses...

34:50.126 --> 34:51.734
You mean the same
two eyewitnesses

34:51.833 --> 34:52.859
that were here before?

34:52.958 --> 34:53.859
Piper.
All right.

34:53.958 --> 34:55.984
SLOAN:
And what were they
doing there?

34:56.083 --> 34:57.192
I mean, how is it

34:57.292 --> 35:00.234
that they just happened
to magically be

35:00.334 --> 35:01.399
at every crime scene?

35:01.499 --> 35:02.775
Try it again.

35:02.875 --> 35:03.984
I am trying.

35:04.084 --> 35:04.750
Objection...

35:08.334 --> 35:09.026
It worked.

35:09.126 --> 35:10.499
Overruled.

35:11.167 --> 35:11.984
It's the judge.

35:12.084 --> 35:12.494
Your Honor,

35:12.504 --> 35:14.399
I move for this case
to be dismissed.

35:14.499 --> 35:16.292
And the PD.

35:19.875 --> 35:20.817
It's everybody.

35:20.917 --> 35:22.001
Oh...

35:24.418 --> 35:26.750
Kill them.

35:27.750 --> 35:28.775
Oh...
What do we do?

35:28.875 --> 35:30.792
(<i>shrieking</i>)

35:31.499 --> 35:35.376
(<i>low growling</i>)

35:37.084 --> 35:41.151
PHOEBE:
Okay, does anybody have
any brilliant ideas?

35:41.251 --> 35:42.151
Uh, can you just freeze them?

35:42.251 --> 35:44.609
No, once they're immune to it,
they stay that way.

35:44.709 --> 35:46.109
That's why it's called immunity.

35:46.209 --> 35:47.399
Great.
(<i>shouting outside</i>)

35:47.499 --> 35:49.359
Okay, this was all
your idea, you know.

35:49.459 --> 35:51.042
Okay, well, so sue me.

35:52.084 --> 35:52.792
Stand back!

35:55.376 --> 35:56.126
Uh...

35:56.750 --> 35:59.026
Uh, any mass
vanquishing spells?

35:59.126 --> 36:00.567
You're the one that's been
studying the book.

36:00.667 --> 36:01.942
Why are you
picking on me?

36:02.042 --> 36:03.359
Because I'm scared
and we're outnumbered.

36:03.459 --> 36:06.750
Okay, but we can't
stay in this room for
the rest of our lives.

36:08.499 --> 36:09.334
Oh...

36:11.625 --> 36:13.984
All right,
the best defense
is a good offense.

36:14.084 --> 36:14.775
Are you ready?

36:14.875 --> 36:15.817
No.
Yeah, you're ready.

36:15.917 --> 36:16.650
No, no.
On three...

36:16.750 --> 36:19.399
One... two...
Don't hold my hand.

36:19.499 --> 36:21.399
One... two... three.

36:21.499 --> 36:22.499
(<i>all grunting</i>)

36:27.499 --> 36:28.500
(<i>grunting</i>)

36:45.042 --> 36:47.418
(<i>grunting</i>)

36:51.625 --> 36:52.500
(<i>screaming</i>)

37:10.542 --> 37:11.209
Ow!

37:12.499 --> 37:13.499
Oh...

37:24.583 --> 37:25.775
Hey, nicely done.

37:25.875 --> 37:26.399
You, too.

37:26.499 --> 37:29.359
Wait a minute.
If they're demons,
where are their powers?

37:29.459 --> 37:30.499
Come to me!

37:36.750 --> 37:37.162
Guardians.

37:37.172 --> 37:39.734
They're not demons,
they're just
protected by them.

37:39.834 --> 37:41.167
Come on...

37:55.167 --> 37:56.984
What the hell?

37:57.084 --> 37:58.567
Thanks...

37:58.667 --> 38:00.542
I'll take it from here.

38:02.001 --> 38:04.542
(<i>screaming</i>)

38:17.500 --> 38:19.650
Okay,
how did that happen?

38:19.750 --> 38:21.399
Good question--
but we're not alone.

38:21.499 --> 38:24.750
We better get back
before Cole unfreezes.

38:28.001 --> 38:30.859
How are we gonna explain
all this to him?

38:30.959 --> 38:33.499
Uh... oh.

38:40.376 --> 38:42.499
I am so sorry.

38:46.376 --> 38:48.376
PHOEBE:
Oh...

38:48.709 --> 38:49.734
Cole,

38:49.834 --> 38:51.499
Cole!

38:53.499 --> 38:54.775
(<i>groans</i>)

38:54.875 --> 38:55.901
Are you okay?

38:56.001 --> 38:58.026
Uh, yeah.

38:58.126 --> 38:59.399
I think so.

38:59.499 --> 39:01.483
Uh, what happened?

39:01.583 --> 39:04.834
Aren't you getting tired
of asking me that?

39:06.167 --> 39:09.901
Um, well, Emilio went nuts

39:10.001 --> 39:10.537
and he tried to escape.

39:10.547 --> 39:13.692
And then all
the courtroom people
tried to help him...

39:13.792 --> 39:15.376
Yeah, thank God for Darryl.

39:16.001 --> 39:17.625
Yep, saved the day.

39:21.042 --> 39:21.984
What?

39:22.084 --> 39:24.442
Something good happened.

39:24.542 --> 39:26.834
Can't you just accept that?

39:28.500 --> 39:30.499
It's not my nature.

39:36.499 --> 39:37.609
âª It's like a dream âª

39:37.709 --> 39:38.817
âª You try to remember
but it's gone âª

39:38.917 --> 39:39.650
âª Then you try to scream âª

39:39.750 --> 39:41.399
âª But it only
comes out as a yawn âª

39:41.499 --> 39:42.399
âª When you try to see âª

39:42.499 --> 39:45.418
âª The world beyond
your front door âª

39:45.792 --> 39:48.359
âª Take your time, is the way
I rhyme gonna make you smile âª

39:48.459 --> 39:51.318
âª When you realize that a guy
my size might take a while âª

39:51.418 --> 39:56.499
âª Just to try to figure out
what all this is for âª

39:57.499 --> 40:01.334
âª It's the perfect time
of day... âª

40:01.583 --> 40:02.454
You've been gone
for two days

40:02.464 --> 40:04.234
and you get the
Barenaked Ladies? How?

40:04.334 --> 40:06.399
Oh, actually, I just made
a couple of phone calls.

40:06.499 --> 40:09.542
And I can't even
get Barry Manilow
on the phone.

40:09.959 --> 40:11.650
I'm sorry I screwed up
your club.

40:11.750 --> 40:13.942
Oh, Phoebe, don't.
I owe you guys

40:14.042 --> 40:14.494
an apology.

40:14.504 --> 40:16.399
And thanks
for covering my butt.

40:16.499 --> 40:17.399
Ah, not a problem.

40:17.499 --> 40:20.859
I didn't even really notice
that you were gone, actually.

40:20.959 --> 40:21.734
Liar.

40:21.834 --> 40:23.026
(<i>laughing</i>)

40:23.126 --> 40:24.734
Yeah, I've been doing
a lot of that lately.

40:24.834 --> 40:27.276
Unfortunately,
especially to Cole.

40:27.376 --> 40:28.192
But, hopefully,

40:28.292 --> 40:29.567
I won't have to lie to him
anymore.

40:29.667 --> 40:30.859
Yeah, well, something tells me

40:30.959 --> 40:32.942
he's not going anywhere,
anytime soon.

40:33.042 --> 40:34.901
No complaints here.

40:35.001 --> 40:36.399
Uh, one over here.

40:36.499 --> 40:37.984
Hottie that he is,

40:38.084 --> 40:38.745
he is an assistant DA

40:38.755 --> 40:41.026
which makes him somewhat
of a threat

40:41.126 --> 40:41.567
to us.

40:41.667 --> 40:42.399
Yeah, but, at least,

40:42.499 --> 40:44.167
he's one of the good guys.

40:46.376 --> 40:47.625
Speaking of the good guys...

40:50.499 --> 40:51.276
Uh, have you

40:51.376 --> 40:52.692
had a change
of heart?

40:52.792 --> 40:54.334
Actually, no.

40:56.126 --> 41:00.400
âª Pinch me, pinch me âª

41:00.500 --> 41:04.901
âª 'Cause I'm still asleep âª

41:05.001 --> 41:11.001
âª Please, God, tell me... âª

41:11.667 --> 41:12.859
LEO:
Hi.

41:12.959 --> 41:14.901
Hi.

41:15.001 --> 41:16.567
Piper, maybe it was a mistake...

41:16.667 --> 41:18.276
Wait. Leo,

41:18.376 --> 41:19.692
me first.

41:19.792 --> 41:23.399
I've been thinking a lot
about our situation

41:23.499 --> 41:24.399
and you asking me

41:24.499 --> 41:27.901
and I... didn't want
to just dismiss it

41:28.001 --> 41:30.499
without thinking it through.

41:31.499 --> 41:34.775
Um, last night,
in the courtroom,

41:34.875 --> 41:36.234
I was actually scared.

41:36.334 --> 41:37.483
For a minute
there,

41:37.583 --> 41:39.399
I thought I wasn't gonna
make it...

41:39.499 --> 41:41.209
that that was it.

41:41.499 --> 41:44.399
And that's when I realized

41:44.499 --> 41:49.499
that I don't want to die without
ever having been married to you.

41:51.583 --> 41:53.859
The answer is yes, Leo.

41:53.959 --> 41:55.276
I'd love to marry you.

41:55.376 --> 41:56.442
Yeah?
Yeah.

41:56.542 --> 41:58.151
Yeah?
Yeah.

41:58.251 --> 42:00.542
(<i>both laughing</i>)

42:13.917 --> 42:18.376
(<i>upbeat pop melody continues</i>)

42:24.042 --> 42:26.499
(<i>song fades out</i>)
