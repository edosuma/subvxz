00:04.990 --> 00:08.023
- This is Sheikh Muhammed Hamid.
- Sheikh Hamid,

00:08.026 --> 00:10.626
I am so sorry for your loss.

00:10.628 --> 00:13.129
You did such important work together

00:13.131 --> 00:15.631
- in the field of...
- Human trafficking.

00:15.633 --> 00:17.767
import-export.

00:17.769 --> 00:19.368
My sympathies.

00:19.370 --> 00:20.837
- Oh, scary.
- Oh, my God.

00:20.839 --> 00:23.473
It's like six degrees
of Al-Qaeda in here.

00:23.475 --> 00:25.908
I hope we don't drone this
place while we're in it.

00:25.910 --> 00:27.276
- Okay, let's just go this way.
- Yes.

00:27.278 --> 00:28.544
No, no, no, no, no.

00:28.546 --> 00:29.812
That's Colonel Omar Al-Saleh.

00:29.814 --> 00:31.180
He's a Sudanese warlord.

00:31.182 --> 00:32.582
You cannot have a photo with him.

00:32.584 --> 00:34.283
He's dressed like a doorman.

00:34.285 --> 00:35.617
Oh, hey, Lu.

00:35.619 --> 00:38.087
I've tried to call you many times.

00:39.923 --> 00:41.523
- The president wishes to express...
- You know what?

00:41.525 --> 00:43.125
I know that you speak English.

00:43.127 --> 00:44.626
If you don't wanna talk
about Tibet, that's fine.

00:44.628 --> 00:46.628
You can just say that.
You can be direct.

00:46.630 --> 00:48.397
Good-bye.

00:48.399 --> 00:50.164
- You don't just forget English.
- Mm-mm.

00:50.166 --> 00:52.033
He just went full Chinaman on me.

00:52.035 --> 00:53.768
Okay, this is Ambassador
Al Jaffar's nephew.

00:53.770 --> 00:57.171
I know you! I didn't recognize
you with your little hat.

00:57.173 --> 00:59.240
I'm... I'm so sorry for your loss.

00:59.242 --> 01:01.242
Oh, well, I have a dozen uncles.

01:01.244 --> 01:03.211
- One less, more for the rest, right?
- Okay.

01:03.213 --> 01:05.279
You know, I saw you
speaking to President Lu.

01:05.281 --> 01:07.081
I wanted to express my sympathies

01:07.083 --> 01:08.749
for how everything unfolded with Tibet.

01:08.751 --> 01:11.652
Oh, yeah, well, tell it to
that ingrate, the Dalai Lama.

01:11.654 --> 01:13.754
I guess he'll be thanking
me in his next life.

01:13.756 --> 01:15.289
I would love to keep chatting,

01:15.291 --> 01:17.325
but the Israeli Trade
Representative is headed this way.

01:17.327 --> 01:20.161
So, let us hope to see each other again.

01:20.163 --> 01:21.629
Let's hope.

01:23.399 --> 01:25.165
- Madam, President, I'm sorry.
- Yes?

01:25.167 --> 01:28.402
Mamnoon Akhtar from Pakistan would
like a photo with his brother.

01:28.404 --> 01:30.738
- Yeah. Shake?
- He's an ambassador.

01:30.740 --> 01:32.239
- No, do I shake his hand?
- No, better not.

01:32.241 --> 01:34.474
Okay. Everyone say goat cheese!

01:34.476 --> 01:36.243
Good!

01:41.350 --> 01:45.818
Should I go? Okay. Mom, we have
some really exciting news.

01:45.820 --> 01:48.655
Okay, Catherine, I think there's something
wrong with your microphone, honey,

01:48.657 --> 01:50.524
because your voice sounds very whiny.

01:50.526 --> 01:51.268
No.

01:51.270 --> 01:53.493
I think maybe it's the
connection, so can you...?

01:53.495 --> 01:55.462
No, it's crystal clear
on our end, ma'am.

01:55.464 --> 01:58.164
- Like Catherine's eyes.
- Oh, yeah, well, you sound the same.

01:58.166 --> 02:01.340
Mom, Marjorie and I wanted
to be the first to tell you...

02:01.341 --> 02:03.036
Ma'am, you gotta see this.

02:03.038 --> 02:06.539
- that we're pregnant!
- Oh, fuck!

02:06.541 --> 02:08.907
- Mom?
- Oh, how could this happen?!

02:08.910 --> 02:11.277
Show her the poster. Look!

02:11.279 --> 02:13.512
- Congratulations, Grandma!
- Oh, yay!

02:13.514 --> 02:16.482
- Maybe I can stop masturbating now.
- I can't... no, no!

02:16.484 --> 02:18.850
- Just hang up on her.
- Richard, no, no, no!

Colonel Omar Al-Saleh,
the 'Butcher of Juba.'"

02:26.227 --> 02:27.926
Omar Al-Saleh bombed his own people.

02:27.928 --> 02:30.462
He is a bomber and a photobomber!

02:30.464 --> 02:35.067
My international reputation is literally
the only thing that I have left now.

02:35.069 --> 02:37.102
That is not true. You
have amazing calves.

02:37.104 --> 02:40.772
Okay, what are we gonna do here? I mean,
what is the opposite of a warlord?

02:40.774 --> 02:43.942
- A peace lady?
- Yes, thank you very much, Richard!

02:43.944 --> 02:45.876
Richard is thinking. He understands.

02:45.878 --> 02:50.582
We need a female hero that we can
wash away this warlord crap with.

02:50.584 --> 02:52.549
And why don't you have
your phone right now?

02:52.551 --> 02:53.685
I... didn't bring it.

02:55.188 --> 02:57.054
I don't have international data, ma'am.

02:57.056 --> 02:58.956
Mike! Please!

02:58.958 --> 03:01.593
Srey Lim, she's a Cambodian
rights activist.

03:01.595 --> 03:03.828
- Perfect.
- Oh, she was born with no legs.

03:03.830 --> 03:06.196
What? Well, that's not
gonna work, is it?

03:06.198 --> 03:07.965
- I know.
- How can I even do a walk and talk?

03:07.967 --> 03:10.400
I can't be with somebody
who's physically disfigured.

03:10.402 --> 03:12.603
- I know you can't.
- It makes me feel sick, okay?

03:12.605 --> 03:14.138
Umida Giyazde.

03:14.140 --> 03:16.573
- She's an Uzbek free speech advocate.
- Fine.

03:16.575 --> 03:18.342
Oh, no, scarred in an acid attack.

03:18.344 --> 03:20.544
- Oh.
- You know, there's Daw Miya Khaing.

03:20.546 --> 03:22.312
Oh, never mind. She was executed.

03:22.314 --> 03:24.681
- Unless... no, that's crazy.
- Damn it, I'm roaming.

03:24.683 --> 03:26.617
- I can't afford to roam!
- We got it, we got it.

03:26.619 --> 03:28.185
Nyaring Ayun,

03:28.187 --> 03:31.288
women's rights dissident
from... get this... the Sudan!

03:31.290 --> 03:31.874
Oh, really?

03:31.875 --> 03:33.624
Yeah, she's currently
under house arrest

03:33.626 --> 03:35.692
for opposing the very warlord
who photobombed you.

03:35.694 --> 03:38.094
- Oh, my God.
- Full quota of limbs.

03:38.096 --> 03:40.263
- She's got a whole face.
- How do you take the battery out?

03:40.265 --> 03:42.298
- That doesn't come out.
- As a girl, she was forced to undergo

03:42.300 --> 03:44.000
the traditional female genital cutting.

03:44.002 --> 03:46.936
Ugh, God! Well, that's not
gonna be on camera, so.

03:46.938 --> 03:48.404
- Just set it up. That's perfect.
<i>- All right.</i>

03:48.406 --> 03:49.873
God, why am I downloading a movie?

03:49.875 --> 03:52.441
Gary? I can't get this...
okay, something's...

03:52.443 --> 03:55.211
- Let's flip you over.
- What? Oh.

03:55.213 --> 03:57.746
Yeah, that's it. We're not going
back now. We're going to the Sudan.

03:57.748 --> 04:00.683
- So I'm gonna need plenty of...
- Of Purell.

04:00.685 --> 04:02.418
I gotta find a Boost Mobile store.

04:02.420 --> 04:04.320
It's too bad we won't have
time to see the camel races.

04:04.322 --> 04:06.855
They're saying that Hamlool
could be the next Al Misk.

04:06.857 --> 04:09.524
<i>And plus, the day
after Daylight Saving Time,</i>

04:09.526 --> 04:11.493
you're all messed up.

04:11.495 --> 04:14.496
One time, my mom brought in my
breakfast an hour late like an idiot,

04:14.498 --> 04:16.331
so I just threw it on
the floor and I said,

04:16.333 --> 04:19.034
"Mom, if I wanted to eat this, I
would've eaten it an hour ago."

04:19.036 --> 04:21.003
But it threw off my
whole bathroom schedule

04:21.005 --> 04:23.005
and I ended up having to
poop in a Sunoco bathroom.

04:23.007 --> 04:24.306
- Can you believe that?
<i>- Jonah,</i>

04:24.308 --> 04:25.640
we have to expand to other issues

04:25.642 --> 04:27.242
that matter in our districts.

04:27.244 --> 04:29.344
To the working people of America.

04:29.346 --> 04:30.579
Ugh, God, snore.

04:30.581 --> 04:33.081
You know what we really need?
A cool name.

04:33.083 --> 04:35.283
Libertonians. Says what we're about.

04:35.285 --> 04:37.219
No, it sounds like a
gay a cappella group.

04:37.221 --> 04:38.853
I got it... the Beltway Boys.

04:38.855 --> 04:40.888
Jesus Christ, are you tag-teaming this?

04:40.890 --> 04:42.156
Those are awful.

04:42.158 --> 04:44.092
I got it.

04:44.094 --> 04:45.459
How about the Jeffersons?

04:45.461 --> 04:47.028
- Oh.
- Hmm?

04:47.030 --> 04:49.396
Oh, that's pretty good, but
it also... you know this...

04:49.398 --> 04:51.265
it happens to be the name of a...

04:51.267 --> 04:53.901
President! Yeah, that's exactly
why I like it, Jaeger.

04:53.903 --> 04:57.538
Tommy J, he's not all played out
like George Washington or Hamilton.

04:57.540 --> 04:59.005
Hamilton wasn't a president.

04:59.007 --> 05:01.375
Then why the fuck did they
write a musical about him?!

05:01.377 --> 05:03.810
No, he was our first
Puerto Rican president.

05:03.812 --> 05:05.312
Ooh, the Washingtones.

05:05.314 --> 05:07.481
No, I am the white Hamilton
of the Jeffersons,

05:07.483 --> 05:08.649
and that's our name.

05:08.651 --> 05:09.983
- To the Jeffersons.
- Ugh.

05:09.985 --> 05:11.552
To the Jeffersons.

05:11.554 --> 05:12.919
That's right, nobody's
gonna keep us down

05:12.921 --> 05:14.955
because we are moving on up.

05:14.957 --> 05:16.589
- The Capitol Hills.
- Hey!

05:16.591 --> 05:18.125
- Or should I say...
- Stop, no.

05:18.127 --> 05:20.794
- ♪ The Capitol Hills. ♪
- God damn it, shut up.

05:20.796 --> 05:22.495
Hey, what do you think of my tie?

05:22.497 --> 05:23.864
I designed it myself.

05:23.866 --> 05:25.232
I call it Yoloha.

05:25.234 --> 05:27.600
It's a combination of YOLO and aloha.

05:27.602 --> 05:29.236
Well, Buzzy, I think it's rad.

05:29.238 --> 05:29.871
Aw!

05:29.873 --> 05:31.771
Which is a combination
of retarded and sad.

05:31.773 --> 05:35.174
Getting soft, Danny boy?
Keep it tight for Jane.

05:35.176 --> 05:37.577
Okay, first of all, I
never miss a glutes day.

05:37.579 --> 05:40.546
And second of all, everyone,
Jane and I are not f...

05:40.548 --> 05:41.914
ah, forget it.

05:41.916 --> 05:43.416
Honestly, if you fucked in front of us,

05:43.418 --> 05:44.417
it'd be more dignified.

05:44.419 --> 05:45.685
Ah, like gorillas at the zoo.

05:45.687 --> 05:47.719
Fuck you, Buzzy. Stevie, look, man,

05:47.721 --> 05:50.122
- I can't take it anymore, dude.
- I'm sorry about the temperature.

05:50.124 --> 05:51.788
Jane just thinks the cold makes her and

05:51.790 --> 05:53.793
Brie's nipples pop more,
and she's not wrong.

05:53.795 --> 05:55.995
No, man. Look, I'm talking about Jane.

05:55.997 --> 05:58.597
All right? The constant ass-grabbing,
it's like sexual harassment!

05:58.599 --> 06:00.766
And what do you want me to do about it?

06:00.768 --> 06:02.868
- You're the producer of the show, man!
- I didn't ask for this, okay?

06:02.870 --> 06:04.202
- Get her to cut it out!
- Hey, boys.

06:04.204 --> 06:05.737
- Hey, morning, Brie.
- Hey, Brie.

06:05.739 --> 06:08.006
- That's a lovely top.
- Oh, thanks, Dan.

06:08.008 --> 06:08.692
Yeah.

06:08.693 --> 06:10.742
I'll get it down by
another three degrees.

06:10.744 --> 06:12.678
Yoloha.

06:12.680 --> 06:13.945
We're back in 10!

06:13.947 --> 06:17.081
- Hi, handsome.
- Hello, pretty.

06:17.083 --> 06:19.217
Ah, it's nice and chilly in here.

06:19.219 --> 06:21.786
<i>We are back in three, two...</i>

06:24.224 --> 06:28.526
Hello! Oh, I like your puffy hairdo.

06:28.528 --> 06:29.760
Oh, my goodness!

06:29.762 --> 06:31.863
Is this for me? Thank you, darling.

06:31.865 --> 06:33.898
Do we have a photographer? 'Cause
I don't wanna do this again.

06:33.900 --> 06:36.000
- Gonna snap some for you right now.
- Get a picture of this.

06:36.002 --> 06:37.935
It's very sweet and thoughtful of you.

06:37.937 --> 06:39.670
- Oop, I did a selfie.
- I don't know what this is.

06:39.672 --> 06:43.173
Is it something that you eat or
is it something you already ate?

06:43.175 --> 06:46.176
Back in America, people are always
telling me to go back to Africa.

06:46.178 --> 06:48.346
I'm actually glad I did,
'cause it's magical out here.

06:48.348 --> 06:50.280
- Yeah.
- Look at you.

06:50.282 --> 06:54.651
A beautiful Western woman helping out world
sufferers in a stunning Gucci scarf.

06:54.653 --> 06:56.416
I know! It's sort of
like a "Vogue" shoot.

06:56.418 --> 06:57.154
It really is.

06:57.156 --> 07:00.623
- Okay, watch out. The dog, the dog.
- Oh, shit.

07:00.625 --> 07:01.925
- I got a surprise for you.
- What?

07:01.927 --> 07:03.727
We are surrounded by land mines.

07:03.729 --> 07:05.762
You're just like Princess Di.

07:05.764 --> 07:07.931
- But with a better nose, of course.
- Oh, stop it.

07:07.933 --> 07:09.333
- You are!
- Okay, you know what?

07:09.335 --> 07:11.000
Why don't you just go ahead, though?

07:11.002 --> 07:12.569
- What?
- Yep, good idea.

07:12.571 --> 07:14.371
- You go ahead.
- We'll be right behind you.

07:14.373 --> 07:17.640
You know what? We should back up a tad.
Back up, kids.

07:17.642 --> 07:20.677
<i>Gary, be careful 'cause I've got a
lot of valuable stuff in that bag!</i>

07:20.679 --> 07:22.345
<i>The congressman
is out at the moment.</i>

07:22.347 --> 07:25.081
The Wisconsin delegation was
giving out cheese curds.

07:25.083 --> 07:27.683
Yeah, he actually slipped on the
rug hightailing it out of here.

07:27.685 --> 07:30.953
Listen, I'm 15 votes shy on
the DOT appropriations bill.

07:30.955 --> 07:33.389
It's crucial to our nation's
transportation system

07:33.391 --> 07:35.791
that Dayton Municipal
Airport isn't shut down.

07:35.793 --> 07:39.661
These small commuter airports
are our country's life blood.

07:39.663 --> 07:41.663
I'm assuming you fly direct into Dayton?

07:41.665 --> 07:43.432
<i>- Every other Friday.</i>
<i>- Congressman Furlong.</i>

07:43.434 --> 07:46.402
Hey, did you get your curds,
Little Miss Muffless?

07:46.404 --> 07:48.203
You know, Will here can't eat cheese.

07:48.205 --> 07:49.938
<i>What happens when you eat cheese, Will?</i>

07:49.940 --> 07:52.240
I go poo-poo in my panty-wanties.

07:52.242 --> 07:55.611
No, you fucking idiot. With
the pinky, with the pinky.

07:55.613 --> 08:00.282
Do it again. What happens
when you eat cheese, Will?

08:00.284 --> 08:03.385
I go poo-poo in my panty-wanties.

08:03.387 --> 08:05.486
No, they were out of curds
before I got there.

08:05.488 --> 08:07.222
Put Wisconsin at the
top of my shit list.

08:07.224 --> 08:10.025
- You want me to bump Sammy Hagar?
- Make them 1A and 1B.

08:10.027 --> 08:13.594
All right, I need you and your buddies
from the Island of Misfit Toys...

08:13.596 --> 08:15.297
Isle.

08:15.299 --> 08:16.997
to vote for my airport bill.

08:20.937 --> 08:24.738
- Wait, so you need something from me?
- Oh, no, it understands.

08:24.740 --> 08:26.440
So, that means I get something from you.

08:26.442 --> 08:28.442
You are going to invite me
to dinner at your house

08:28.444 --> 08:31.211
or I am going to fuck all your shit up.

08:31.213 --> 08:34.347
- And you're gonna make me the paella.
- You play with the paella?

08:34.350 --> 08:37.517
Mrs. Furlong is only interested
in hosting married couples,

08:37.519 --> 08:40.219
and you and your imaginary
dragon don't count.

08:40.221 --> 08:42.489
- I'm coming, too.
- Whoa, what's this,

08:42.491 --> 08:44.858
the fourth horseface of the Apocalypse?

08:44.860 --> 08:46.626
Jesus, Jonah, if you're
gonna pay for sex,

08:46.628 --> 08:49.329
just add the extra two bucks
for the premium edition.

08:49.331 --> 08:52.165
Um, this is Shawnee Tanz,

08:52.167 --> 08:53.866
daughter of Sherman Tanz.

08:53.868 --> 08:55.534
Ah, Ms. Tanz!

08:55.536 --> 08:57.971
Rumors of your beauty have
not been exaggerated.

08:57.973 --> 08:59.872
Yeah, he's bringing me to dinner.

08:59.874 --> 09:00.873
We're engaged.

09:02.077 --> 09:03.509
Wait, what? We are?

09:03.511 --> 09:05.044
There's a ring on hold at Tiffany's.

09:05.046 --> 09:07.080
Pick it up by 6:00.
It's already paid for.

09:07.082 --> 09:08.881
Fine, dinner, my house.

09:08.883 --> 09:10.950
Will one of you please
bathe and dress him?

09:10.952 --> 09:12.885
I call dress. Sorry, Kent.

09:12.887 --> 09:14.520
- Mazel tov.
<i>- Thanks, Will.</i>

09:14.522 --> 09:15.955
Babe, this is so exciting!

09:15.957 --> 09:18.423
I know. Can you believe it? Yay.

09:18.425 --> 09:20.960
Good things happen to good people.

09:20.962 --> 09:23.195
So, where are you taking us?

09:23.197 --> 09:25.764
Do we have a house
arrest address or what?

09:25.766 --> 09:28.467
- I'd love me some house arrest.
- Are you kidding me, Mike?

09:28.469 --> 09:31.403
You look like an old Dyke in
an English gardening show.

09:31.405 --> 09:33.405
Oh, here we go! Nyaring!

09:33.407 --> 09:35.773
- Madam President.
- Madam President.

09:35.775 --> 09:37.442
I thought you weren't allowed outside.

09:37.444 --> 09:39.011
She hasn't been released, has she?

09:39.013 --> 09:41.146
- Can't go past the goat. Come!
- Oh, okay.

09:41.148 --> 09:42.714
This goat has an ear infection.

09:42.716 --> 09:47.318
Nyaring, your courage is an
inspiration to the world.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.387
<i>And so I give you this peace lily</i>

09:49.389 --> 09:53.290
as a symbol of your brave
stand for freedom.

09:53.292 --> 09:56.995
- Oh, and for peace, too.
- It needs to be watered twice daily.

09:56.997 --> 09:58.997
- We have no water here.
- Okay.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.731
Oh. Oh, well, that's fine.

10:00.733 --> 10:03.667
- We can just put it with the recycling.
- That is my bed.

10:03.669 --> 10:06.937
Oh. Wow, it... wow, that's a cozy bed.

10:06.939 --> 10:09.673
Come, let me serve my
American visitors tea

10:09.675 --> 10:12.109
while over half the Sudanese
suffer in starvation.

10:13.913 --> 10:15.346
<i>She's kind of a bitch.</i>

10:15.348 --> 10:17.714
Well, the girl is slow with the tea.

10:17.716 --> 10:19.249
Okay, I will sit.

10:19.251 --> 10:21.151
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, my!

10:21.153 --> 10:23.987
Look at those curtains.
Where can I get those?

10:23.989 --> 10:26.156
I made them from my
husband's death shroud.

10:26.158 --> 10:29.526
- Wow, look at you!
- What a touching tribute, Nyaring.

10:29.528 --> 10:31.695
No, it was a purposeful desecration

10:31.697 --> 10:33.563
of the man who beat and raped me.

10:33.565 --> 10:35.565
Well, they go with everything.

10:35.567 --> 10:37.100
Under Colonel Al-Saleh,

10:37.102 --> 10:39.202
the oppression of women has
been growing year after year.

10:39.204 --> 10:42.905
Absolutely, and that is why this
photo opportunity is so vital.

10:42.907 --> 10:45.241
- It sends a "Po-ent" message...
- Potent.

10:45.243 --> 10:47.610
potent indeed... to the world

10:47.612 --> 10:49.912
to topple the patriarchy.

10:49.914 --> 10:52.314
Yes. How do we do that?

10:52.316 --> 10:54.483
Well, we are gonna figure that out.

10:54.485 --> 10:57.987
- You know, I think we have to...
- We do. I'm sorry very much.

10:57.989 --> 10:59.940
There seems to be a
problem with the plane.

10:59.942 --> 11:00.590
What?

11:00.592 --> 11:04.126
You know that little animal that
Nathan Lane plays in "The Lion King"?

11:04.128 --> 11:05.694
- Oh, I love that guy!
- Yes, yes.

11:05.696 --> 11:07.563
Uh, so, three of those got
caught in the engine.

11:07.565 --> 11:09.998
- Oh.
- Do we know anybody with a plane

11:10.000 --> 11:11.733
in this neck of the woods?

11:11.735 --> 11:14.570
Jaffar, thank you so much

11:14.572 --> 11:17.739
- for sending your giant, giant plane.
- Oh, no, no, please.

11:17.741 --> 11:19.475
A beautiful woman lost in the desert

11:19.477 --> 11:22.310
with only a small group of complete
incompetents to assist her?

11:22.312 --> 11:24.212
Yeah, they really are
incompetent, aren't they?

11:24.214 --> 11:26.481
I've never seen anything quite like
it, frankly. How do you do it?

11:26.483 --> 11:29.283
- I'm gonna let them all go.
- But, you know, I was very pleased

11:29.285 --> 11:30.986
to receive your call.

11:30.988 --> 11:32.587
Oh, really? Why was that?

11:32.589 --> 11:35.056
Well, there have been some
interesting developments in Sudan

11:35.058 --> 11:37.592
ever since that photo came
out of you and the warlord.

11:37.594 --> 11:38.361
Oh, mm.

11:38.363 --> 11:40.661
You know, Sudan has
significant deposits

11:40.663 --> 11:44.898
of chromium ore, gallium, zinc, as
well as other natural resources.

11:44.900 --> 11:47.801
Let me guess, resources another country

11:47.803 --> 11:50.471
might be desperate to
get their hands on?

11:50.473 --> 11:52.773
Perhaps even your friends in China?

11:52.775 --> 11:54.275
Beautiful and brilliant.

11:54.277 --> 11:57.645
Well, I remembered you Qataris
are very wet-fingered.

11:57.647 --> 11:59.446
You have no idea.

12:01.817 --> 12:04.051
<i>You know, you
don't have to go so soon.</i>

12:04.053 --> 12:07.021
I bet you say that to all
your Western heretics.

12:07.023 --> 12:10.357
We could just discuss registering
cargo ships in Panama.

12:10.359 --> 12:12.853
Well, I think Liberia would
be better for tax reasons.

12:12.855 --> 12:13.761
Oh, yes, ma'am.

12:13.762 --> 12:17.297
- Can you help me unzip the zipper?
- Of course.

12:17.299 --> 12:19.266
Hey, Dan, could we talk
to you for a moment?

12:19.268 --> 12:21.034
- Yeah, what's...?
- Hi, Mr. Egan.

12:21.036 --> 12:22.469
I'm Roberta Winston.

12:22.471 --> 12:25.138
I work in the Department of
Human Resources here at CBS.

12:25.140 --> 12:28.607
I'm here to discuss the allegations
of sexual harassment...

12:28.609 --> 12:31.377
Okay, that wardrobe girl is crazy.

12:31.379 --> 12:33.946
No, no, no... that you
made against Jane McCabe.

12:33.948 --> 12:36.015
What? Uh... oh.

12:36.017 --> 12:37.717
Well, I didn't mean...

12:37.719 --> 12:39.518
Mr. Egan, CBS policy requires

12:39.520 --> 12:41.054
that when a victim reports abuse,

12:41.056 --> 12:42.755
it sets in motion a chain of events

12:42.757 --> 12:44.990
that can result in the
abuser's suspension

12:44.992 --> 12:47.226
or immediate termination.

12:47.228 --> 12:49.628
- Oh, yeah, I'm cool with that.
<i>- Danny?</i>

12:49.630 --> 12:51.664
Your exposé on s'mores,

12:51.666 --> 12:53.365
it needs a stronger take...

12:53.367 --> 12:54.900
- oh.
- Oh, Christ.

12:54.902 --> 12:57.203
Excuse me, what is going on here?

12:57.205 --> 13:00.372
Excuse me, Ms. McCabe, but
this is a private meeting.

13:00.374 --> 13:04.743
There are no private meetings at the
"CBS Morning Show" without Jane McCabe.

13:04.745 --> 13:07.412
Well, Mr. Egan has filed a complaint

13:07.414 --> 13:10.215
that you have created a sexually
inappropriate workplace environment.

13:10.217 --> 13:12.918
- Yeah, Jane, they made me.
- Sexually inappropriate?!

13:12.920 --> 13:16.454
You microdicked weasel, you
couldn't even fill my pisshole.

13:16.456 --> 13:18.590
- Jesus, Jane!
- Do you see how she talks to me?

13:18.592 --> 13:21.892
- Ms. McCabe, this is a safe space...
- Oh, you fucking people!

13:21.894 --> 13:24.895
- I'm sorry, what?!
- Oh, you know, the HR people.

13:24.897 --> 13:27.332
Ms. McCabe, let me advise you
that any further statement...

13:27.334 --> 13:31.202
Let me advise you that I built this
goddamn network with my own two tits!

13:31.204 --> 13:34.571
- We aren't even fucking!
- Oh, how dare you?

13:34.573 --> 13:36.006
Ms. McCabe, everyone knows.

13:36.008 --> 13:37.674
<i> Ma'am, the President of Egypt</i>

13:37.676 --> 13:39.376
is expecting your call at 3:00 PM.

13:39.378 --> 13:40.778
Okay, send his mistress a gift.

13:40.780 --> 13:42.279
Maybe something from Neiman's.

13:42.281 --> 13:43.781
Oh, no, wait.

13:43.783 --> 13:45.950
Any department store that
wasn't started by Jews.

13:45.952 --> 13:47.584
I will have to start one myself.

13:47.586 --> 13:50.987
Now, I'm gonna need a report
on mineral rights in Sudan.

13:50.989 --> 13:52.389
- Okay.
- And I have to find out,

13:52.391 --> 13:54.591
what's Qatari for "morning after pill"?

13:54.593 --> 13:57.026
- Oh, my God.
- It's probably a stoning,

13:57.028 --> 13:58.695
which would also do the trick.

13:58.697 --> 14:02.098
<i>Whoa, Mike! What happened?</i>

14:02.100 --> 14:04.401
You look like the
business end of a baboon.

14:04.403 --> 14:06.270
My ear tops burn the worst, too.

14:06.272 --> 14:08.872
But they're starting to peel,
so soon, they won't be as red.

14:08.874 --> 14:10.874
- Be as red. Be as red.
- What?

14:10.876 --> 14:12.708
You know, when I talk, I
can hear my skin crunch.

14:12.710 --> 14:14.978
- Oh... Lord.
- Makes me wanna eat cereal.

14:14.980 --> 14:16.846
Ma'am, are you sure
that you wanna go out

14:16.848 --> 14:18.714
on such a limb for Ambassador Jaffar?

14:18.716 --> 14:19.533
Well...

14:19.535 --> 14:21.985
Ben says Qataris are very
good at inserting themselves.

14:21.987 --> 14:24.186
- You got that right.
- Be as red.

14:24.188 --> 14:26.188
- Be as red.
- Ma'am, what I'm trying to ask is...

14:26.190 --> 14:29.325
I know, you think I'm going a
little too fast with Jaffar.

14:29.327 --> 14:30.626
- I'm not!
- No.

14:30.628 --> 14:33.329
Now, Amy, for the first
time in a long time,

14:33.331 --> 14:35.063
- I feel like myself.
- Mm-hmm.

14:35.065 --> 14:38.834
Or, you know, at least the person
I'm supposed to feel like.

14:38.836 --> 14:41.203
Anyway, the only question
that I do have is

14:41.205 --> 14:44.940
do you think that I can
be dating someone who's...

14:44.942 --> 14:47.642
- So much younger?
- No, Muslim.

14:47.644 --> 14:49.244
- Right.
- You know?

14:49.246 --> 14:51.880
Can I be with one of them?

14:51.882 --> 14:53.415
It would be political suicide.

14:53.417 --> 14:55.984
Oh, pfft, okay, last time I checked,

14:55.986 --> 14:58.753
my political career had
answered a craigslist ad

14:58.755 --> 15:01.423
for a modeling shoot in the
Angeles National Forest.

15:01.425 --> 15:03.224
<i>The Egyptians are in.</i>

15:03.226 --> 15:05.960
All China has to do is throw
in a few hundred FN-6 missiles

15:05.962 --> 15:09.564
and this deal is Mao Ze-done, baby.

15:09.566 --> 15:12.467
Those Sphinx-fuckers really
love them some Chinese takeout.

15:12.469 --> 15:14.735
- I'll let the Algerians know it's on.
- All right.

15:14.737 --> 15:16.437
This is what the Arab
Spring was all about...

15:16.439 --> 15:19.841
arms deals and the exploitation
of third world resources.

15:19.843 --> 15:21.943
Ah!

15:21.945 --> 15:23.477
- Here's the Chinese.
- Mm.

15:23.479 --> 15:25.512
Look, even their blinker is on.

15:25.514 --> 15:27.215
Selina, my good friend.

15:27.217 --> 15:29.750
Somebody's been using
their Rosetta Stone CDs.

15:29.752 --> 15:32.686
- Come, let's head inside.
- Yeah, kind of a dicey neighborhood.

15:32.688 --> 15:35.222
- You better lock up your chopper.
- Oh.

15:35.224 --> 15:36.657
- How you doing?
- Pretty good.

15:36.659 --> 15:39.326
Listen, it's also essential
to the Egyptians

15:39.328 --> 15:40.706
that the Israelis can't know.

15:40.708 --> 15:43.129
Maybe they're
listening right now.

15:45.735 --> 15:49.002
- So, do we have a deal?
- There is one more thing.

15:49.004 --> 15:51.271
- I want Tibet.
- We gave you Tibet.

15:51.273 --> 15:53.673
No, you gave Montez Tibet.

15:53.675 --> 15:55.742
You gave me yak shit.

15:55.744 --> 15:57.377
You're an infuriating woman.

15:57.379 --> 15:59.512
Oh, yeah, you're all
rainbows and sunshine.

15:59.514 --> 16:02.849
But unless you're planning on
knitting your semiconductors

16:02.851 --> 16:04.884
out of bamboo shoots and panda cock,

16:04.886 --> 16:07.887
you're gonna need every ounce of
gallium you can get in Sudan.

16:07.889 --> 16:10.590
- Well, there are other sources.
- Rots of ruck with that.

16:10.592 --> 16:12.692
What's gonna happen when
your honorable citizens

16:12.694 --> 16:15.127
can't put their kung pao
chicken on the table

16:15.129 --> 16:18.664
and start to question this
communist-capitalist shit swirly

16:18.666 --> 16:19.899
you've been serving up?

16:19.901 --> 16:22.501
Yu must really crave
public acknowledgment.

16:22.503 --> 16:26.305
Oh, yeah, and you must really
crave a 6.7 GDP growth.

16:28.675 --> 16:31.343
- Deal.
- Fantastic.

16:31.345 --> 16:34.113
- Madam President, always a pleasure.
- Yeah, always a pleasure.

16:34.115 --> 16:35.547
Thank you, Lu.

16:37.350 --> 16:40.752
Confucius say fuck, yeah!

16:40.754 --> 16:42.854
- We must celebrate, huh?
- How about that? Yeah!

16:42.856 --> 16:45.957
- Come on.
- Isn't this a rush or what?

16:45.959 --> 16:48.059
Don't you feel it? I just
want a tiny, tiny bit.

16:48.061 --> 16:51.062
I don't want this whole evening
to go all Natalie Wood on me.

16:51.064 --> 16:53.464
- Come here, you.
- Wait a minute, what is this?

16:53.466 --> 16:54.498
<i>What?</i>

16:56.636 --> 16:59.304
when US President Laura Montez

16:59.306 --> 17:02.340
flew directly to Sudan
from the G7 summit

17:02.342 --> 17:03.908
to meet with her in person.

17:03.910 --> 17:06.243
Mohammad H. Christ, that's my dissident.

17:06.246 --> 17:09.713
I am honored to introduce
the world to Nyaring.

17:09.714 --> 17:12.348
- What?
- And to present her with these flowers.

17:12.351 --> 17:15.819
President Montez did, however, face
a wave of criticism in America...

17:15.821 --> 17:16.422
Oh.

17:16.424 --> 17:18.221
for what was seen as a
missed opportunity...

17:18.223 --> 17:19.623
to directly address

17:19.625 --> 17:21.425
the issue of women's rights abuses...

17:21.426 --> 17:23.993
All right, you know what I'm gonna do?

17:23.996 --> 17:27.164
- What?
- I'm going back to motherfucking Sudan.

17:27.165 --> 17:28.763
But you were just there.
Aren't you having a good time?

17:28.764 --> 17:29.732
Absolutely, and I'm gonna say

17:29.734 --> 17:33.236
what Titty Gonzalez was
too chicken-shit to say.

17:33.238 --> 17:36.906
Selina Meyer is gonna be all
about women empowerment now.

17:36.908 --> 17:38.508
- I want voting rights.
- Mm-hmm.

17:38.510 --> 17:39.876
I want equal pay.

17:39.878 --> 17:42.144
No more stoning of the rapee.

17:42.146 --> 17:43.580
Let's stone the raper!

17:43.582 --> 17:45.281
I suppose you'll be needing my plane?

17:45.283 --> 17:48.585
- Pretty please?
- Well, when you say it like that.

17:51.055 --> 17:52.321
I wanna say something about my paella.

17:52.323 --> 17:54.624
Now, it is so good, when you taste it,

17:54.626 --> 17:56.258
what's gonna happen, Will?

17:56.260 --> 17:58.594
You're gonna wanna take it to
a church and marry it, Rog.

17:58.596 --> 18:00.129
Damn straight!

18:00.131 --> 18:02.664
Roger, that's a dollar in the swear jar.

18:02.666 --> 18:04.633
- Aw, crud.
- That's $2!

18:04.635 --> 18:06.768
- What?
- Potty mouth, potty mouth, Roger.

18:06.770 --> 18:09.738
Ah, Julie points out that
to be a true Valenciana,

18:09.740 --> 18:13.609
one must add live snails just
as the water comes to a boil.

18:13.611 --> 18:15.176
Still, respect.

18:15.178 --> 18:16.745
<i>Hey, wait, before we dig in,</i>

18:16.747 --> 18:19.715
I'd like to make a toast to
our honored guest, Jonah,

18:19.717 --> 18:21.682
and his stunning bride-to-be,

18:21.684 --> 18:24.284
and all their gracious
help with my airport bill.

18:24.286 --> 18:25.987
- Hear, hear.
- Cheers!

18:25.989 --> 18:26.623
Cheers.

18:26.624 --> 18:28.523
You know, Roger,
I've been thinking

18:28.525 --> 18:31.926
that for somebody who has
been so helpful on your bill,

18:31.928 --> 18:33.661
I should probably have a better office

18:33.663 --> 18:35.663
than the fifth floor of the
Cannon Building, don't you think?

18:37.633 --> 18:39.900
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>
- Well, that's interesting.

18:39.902 --> 18:42.036
Yeah, well, this actually
is pretty interesting.

18:42.038 --> 18:44.004
Hey, Jonah, why don't you and I

18:44.006 --> 18:46.606
go down in the wine cellar and
pick out another bottle of wine?

18:46.608 --> 18:48.475
- What do you say, champ?
- No, I'm good.

18:48.477 --> 18:50.377
- Aw, it'd just take a minute.
- No, I think I'm fine.

18:50.379 --> 18:53.414
- I'm just fine right here.
- This is so delicious.

18:53.416 --> 18:55.381
Shh, please, don't ruin this, too, okay?

18:55.383 --> 18:59.252
Jiminy Cricket, guess who forgot
to cut up oranges for the sangria.

18:59.254 --> 19:01.888
This gal right here!

19:01.890 --> 19:03.723
Whack-a-doo! What?

19:03.725 --> 19:06.726
I tell ya, if her crucifix wasn't
around her neck, she'd lose it.

19:06.728 --> 19:08.261
- You know, I can help you back there.
- No, no, no.

19:08.263 --> 19:09.896
Shh, shh. You stay seated. Enjoy!

19:09.898 --> 19:11.830
- No, please don't go.
- Thanks, honey!

19:11.832 --> 19:13.799
All right, you anal
fistula, we had a deal

19:13.801 --> 19:16.102
in return for all this
creamy domesticity

19:16.104 --> 19:17.970
I'm blowing all over your droopy tits!

19:17.972 --> 19:20.173
Well, now I want a new office.

19:20.175 --> 19:23.443
And I want Rihanna to put a gun to my
head while she makes me eat her out,

19:23.445 --> 19:25.644
but guess what, that's
about as likely to happen

19:25.646 --> 19:28.881
as Will's wife putting a baby in
her polyp festival of a uterus!

19:28.883 --> 19:30.983
<i>- Jesus Christ.</i>
- Why did you tell him that?

19:30.985 --> 19:32.985
<i>- What's a polyp?</i>
- I just had to tell somebody.

19:32.987 --> 19:36.221
I would sooner gouge out
your eye and fuck your skull

19:36.223 --> 19:38.624
from here to the end of time.

19:38.626 --> 19:41.860
That's what we're promised,
that Jesus is our Lord.

19:41.862 --> 19:43.962
<i>Hallelujah. Amen, Dad.</i>

19:43.964 --> 19:45.797
That is just so moving!

19:45.799 --> 19:48.066
- Sorry I missed that!
- I loved that, too.

19:48.068 --> 19:49.934
Jonah has called an
early breakfast meeting

19:49.936 --> 19:51.970
of the Jeffersons on Tuesday morning.

19:51.972 --> 19:54.172
Wait, I have? Come on, how early?

19:54.174 --> 19:57.509
And if he has to walk down
five flights of stairs,

19:57.511 --> 19:59.777
he might get so tired that
he forgets to tell them

19:59.779 --> 20:01.445
how to vote on your airport bill.

20:01.447 --> 20:03.648
- I can just write it on my hand.
- Shh!

20:03.650 --> 20:07.451
We don't want that, do we?

20:07.453 --> 20:09.988
Say, Jonah, how about I start looking

20:09.990 --> 20:12.490
for that new office for
you first thing tomorrow?

20:12.492 --> 20:13.958
<i>- Mm!</i>
- Thank you, Roger.

20:13.960 --> 20:16.693
Wow! Congratulations, honey!

20:16.695 --> 20:18.395
Thank you, Mrs. Furlong. Thank you.

20:18.397 --> 20:20.364
Can I please have some more wine?

20:20.366 --> 20:22.699
Mike, come on. What is this?

20:22.701 --> 20:24.635
Ma'am, it's the only
sunscreen I could find here.

20:24.637 --> 20:27.138
You look like the world's
least-fucked geisha.

20:27.140 --> 20:28.506
- Ugh.
- Oh, Nyaring!

20:28.508 --> 20:29.706
- I am back.
- You are back.

20:29.708 --> 20:31.175
President Montez came to see me.

20:31.177 --> 20:33.176
Oh, I had not heard that.

20:33.178 --> 20:36.246
- She has such wonderful hair.
- Oh, luxurious.

20:38.083 --> 20:40.550
But I did bring you a gift.

20:40.552 --> 20:41.361
And...

20:41.363 --> 20:43.787
Uh, your countrymen have
sent thousands of flowers.

20:43.789 --> 20:46.589
Now they rot in the heat.
Many have fallen ill.

20:46.591 --> 20:49.992
- There has been one death.
- Oh, okay.

20:49.994 --> 20:53.129
Everyone, I'm so honored to be here.

20:53.131 --> 20:58.334
Nyaring, I have come to do what
President Montez did not do.

20:58.336 --> 21:04.307
I will speak on behalf
of our sisters, Nyaring.

21:04.309 --> 21:07.076
- Amen, amen.
- Yes, absolutely.

21:07.078 --> 21:08.978
Oh, right, um,

21:08.980 --> 21:11.814
I'll just give it a little toss right...

21:11.816 --> 21:14.249
Aw, thank you.

21:14.251 --> 21:17.252
What happened to the little
girl who served us tea?

21:17.254 --> 21:17.957
I don't see her.

21:17.959 --> 21:20.022
Oh, she was married
to the village elder.

21:20.024 --> 21:21.691
- Ah.
- Saturday.

21:21.693 --> 21:23.868
Well, please send along
my congratulations.

21:23.870 --> 21:24.593
Oh, God.

21:24.595 --> 21:27.862
<i> How did you get me such a
great speaking slot so last-minute?</i>

21:27.864 --> 21:29.565
It's an Arab conference on human rights.

21:29.567 --> 21:30.766
You can pretty much
have any slot you want.

21:30.768 --> 21:31.166
Yeah.

21:31.168 --> 21:33.068
- After the men, of course.
- Right.

21:33.070 --> 21:36.238
Ma'am, here's your speech.
Sorry about the hummus stains.

21:36.240 --> 21:38.540
Oh, my God. What happened?

21:38.542 --> 21:41.542
Turns out it wasn't zinc oxide.
I was wearing cocoa butter.

21:41.544 --> 21:43.244
You look like redheaded bacon.

21:43.246 --> 21:44.579
- Okay.
- Stop!

21:44.581 --> 21:47.548
This is very strong stuff.

21:47.550 --> 21:50.752
- Thank you, ma'am.
- NuvaRing is gonna dig this a lot.

21:50.754 --> 21:52.653
- It's Nyaring.
- Ma'am, I'm just so optimistic

21:52.655 --> 21:55.423
about the world we're creating
for your coming grandchild.

21:55.425 --> 21:58.058
Wait, what? Catherine's pregnant?

21:58.060 --> 22:01.061
Ma'am, do you prefer
Gram-Gram or Mee-Maw?

22:01.063 --> 22:01.952
What did you just say?

22:01.953 --> 22:03.931
Madam President, may
I have a word, please?

22:03.933 --> 22:05.600
- Yeah. Hey.
- Mm-hmm. Hi.

22:05.602 --> 22:08.536
Hey, did you see those paparazzi
shots of us in the "Daily Mail"?

22:08.538 --> 22:10.738
- I did.
- Those scum-sucking vultures

22:10.740 --> 22:12.072
got some really good shots of us.

22:12.074 --> 22:13.473
- Um, so...
- Yes?

22:13.475 --> 22:15.209
Colonel Al-Saleh is here.

22:15.211 --> 22:16.676
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

22:16.678 --> 22:19.913
They let a warlord into a
human rights conference?

22:19.915 --> 22:21.615
He's actually one of the sponsors.

22:21.617 --> 22:24.218
But anyway, the point is
any sort of strong speech

22:24.220 --> 22:28.222
where you're condemning or embarrassing
his record on female rights,

22:28.224 --> 22:29.356
it might just scuttle the deal.

22:29.358 --> 22:30.990
So maybe you could just focus on

22:30.992 --> 22:32.859
some of the more positive
elements of Sudan.

22:32.861 --> 22:34.761
Yeah, and what are the
positive elements?

22:34.763 --> 22:35.828
You getting credit for Tibet.

22:37.532 --> 22:40.099
Oh, God.

22:40.101 --> 22:42.835
- I... let me just talk to my people.
- Mm-hmm.

22:42.837 --> 22:46.372
The heat is coming off.

22:46.374 --> 22:48.374
You got any people I could talk to?

22:50.979 --> 22:52.378
<i>Selina Meyer.</i>

22:55.183 --> 22:56.783
Good afternoon.

22:56.785 --> 23:01.787
Gentlemen and... lady,

23:01.789 --> 23:04.590
I rise today to...

23:05.959 --> 23:11.229
consider in the most open-minded of ways

23:11.231 --> 23:13.465
the situation in the Sudan.

23:13.467 --> 23:16.034
Women's rights are human rights,

23:16.036 --> 23:17.603
and human rights...

23:18.939 --> 23:22.908
are part of a diverse pageant

23:22.910 --> 23:27.946
of different priorities.

23:27.948 --> 23:32.483
Uh, while there has been
some very positive progress,

23:32.485 --> 23:34.519
there are some practices, however,

23:34.521 --> 23:38.155
that require a firm stance,

23:38.157 --> 23:41.559
such as female genital mutilation.

23:42.595 --> 23:44.995
And our stance must be...

23:46.098 --> 23:49.400
who are we to judge?

23:49.402 --> 23:51.869
Don't we... in the United States,

23:51.871 --> 23:54.738
<i>we practice male circumcision on boys</i>

23:54.740 --> 23:56.974
as young as tiny babies.

23:56.976 --> 23:59.877
So, uh,

23:59.879 --> 24:02.112
glass houses.

24:02.114 --> 24:04.781
And I would also add
that it really does help

24:04.783 --> 24:07.818
to prevent sexually transmitted diseases

24:07.820 --> 24:11.187
as well as certain types of cancer.

24:11.189 --> 24:13.122
And female circumcision...

24:14.526 --> 24:18.094
I'm sure you have your reasons.

24:18.096 --> 24:21.164
And so we look forward to...

24:22.300 --> 24:25.068
a bright future.

24:25.070 --> 24:27.103
Thank you.

24:28.340 --> 24:31.007
Thank you.

24:32.344 --> 24:34.010
Thank you.

24:34.012 --> 24:36.379
<i>All right, you can
open your eyes, Congressman.</i>

24:39.217 --> 24:41.049
Fuck, yeah!

24:41.051 --> 24:44.052
I can legislate the shit
out of shit in here.

24:44.054 --> 24:45.554
Could you tell the Colossus of Chodes

24:45.556 --> 24:48.391
that this is the exact
same goddamn office,

24:48.393 --> 24:50.860
<i>only three floors down
with a shittier view?</i>

24:50.862 --> 24:54.296
Oh, I have never seen a
shitty view look so good.

24:54.298 --> 24:56.131
You know what I see? I see power.

24:56.133 --> 24:59.401
Oh, hey, Kent, there's a sweet-ass
armchair in a Dumpster out there.

24:59.403 --> 25:01.603
- I'll get it.
- Hello, Bent.

25:01.605 --> 25:04.006
Come on, Jonah. Let's
christen your new pad.

25:04.008 --> 25:06.674
I'm gonna drink some champizzle
and eat some poontizzle.

25:06.676 --> 25:08.243
- No, you're not.
- Oh, babe,

25:08.245 --> 25:10.445
wait until you see the sweet
new armchair I just bought.

25:10.447 --> 25:12.680
Second goddamn floor, I
can't even commit suicide.

25:12.682 --> 25:15.049
I got a key to the roof. We
could do a Butch-Sundance.

25:15.051 --> 25:16.718
Nah, I'll just wait for cancer.

25:16.720 --> 25:18.887
<i>Your hat looks
like it's hand-made.</i>

25:18.889 --> 25:22.356
I have a lesbian daughter who
would absolutely love that.

25:22.358 --> 25:24.859
Oh, Lu, how we doing?

25:24.861 --> 25:27.194
No, seriously, you know what? You
really don't have to translate.

25:27.196 --> 25:30.631
Lu and I have...

25:30.633 --> 25:32.900
President Lu says,

25:32.902 --> 25:35.102
"Thank you for all your nothing."

25:39.608 --> 25:41.208
Who went pee-pee in his Coke?

25:41.210 --> 25:43.277
I'm sorry, Selina. The deal's off.

25:43.279 --> 25:44.912
But my speech! I...

25:44.914 --> 25:46.580
Colonel Al-Saleh felt
that you could've been

25:46.582 --> 25:48.014
a bit more enthusiastic.

25:48.016 --> 25:49.883
What do I have to do, pull out my clit

25:49.885 --> 25:51.718
and cut it off in front of everyone

25:51.720 --> 25:53.687
to get anything done in this world?

25:53.689 --> 25:56.957
As we say in Qatar, "You should never
build your house on shifting sands."

25:56.959 --> 25:58.859
Okay, well, everything's
built on sand here,

25:58.861 --> 26:00.727
so that doesn't make any sense at all.

26:00.729 --> 26:03.696
The point is there will be other
deals down the line for you, Selina.

26:03.698 --> 26:07.834
So, what's next, huh? Liberian
refugee crisis might be sexy.

26:07.836 --> 26:09.569
Uh...

26:09.571 --> 26:11.371
- What's going on?
- <i> Selina, I'm sorry,</i>

26:11.373 --> 26:13.506
but you know I can't be
with someone like you.

26:13.508 --> 26:15.908
Like me? What do you mean? Like what?

26:15.910 --> 26:17.877
You know, white.

26:17.879 --> 26:19.279
One of them.

26:20.314 --> 26:22.782
Wow.

26:22.784 --> 26:25.351
Okay, that is racist.

26:25.353 --> 26:26.486
- Is it?
- <i> Oh, yeah!</i>

26:26.488 --> 26:28.253
I don't see color.

26:28.255 --> 26:31.190
- You know, to me, you're, like, white.
- Okay.

26:31.192 --> 26:34.460
I thought that we would be traveling
around the world on your yacht,

26:34.462 --> 26:37.129
solving international crises and...

26:37.131 --> 26:39.731
We will always have the yacht.

26:39.733 --> 26:41.633
But you just said we won't.

26:41.635 --> 26:43.668
I meant the memory of the yacht.

26:43.670 --> 26:46.771
You know, my father saw
our paparazzi pictures.

26:46.773 --> 26:48.007
He was not pleased.

26:49.310 --> 26:51.243
All right, fine. I get it.

26:51.245 --> 26:54.145
I am so sorry. Selina.

26:54.147 --> 26:56.114
But your dad wasn't pleased

26:56.116 --> 26:58.349
because he thought I was white, right?

26:58.351 --> 27:01.352
I mean, not because he thought there
was any age difference between us,

27:01.354 --> 27:03.287
'cause there practically isn't one.

27:03.289 --> 27:05.724
Oh, yeah, yeah, it was
just the white thing.

27:05.726 --> 27:08.192
- Mm-hmm.
- He also thought you might be Jewish.

27:08.194 --> 27:10.294
Well, I'm not.

27:14.800 --> 27:17.168
It's 8:50 AM...

27:18.604 --> 27:20.104
and this is not easy,

27:20.106 --> 27:24.342
but this is going to be my last day

27:24.344 --> 27:28.211
as a regular part of the
"CBS Morning Show" family.

27:28.213 --> 27:30.010
Oh, no, no, you will
still be part of the

27:30.012 --> 27:31.849
"CBS This Morning with
Danny Egan" family.

27:31.851 --> 27:33.043
Absolutely.

27:33.045 --> 27:36.620
I am so grateful to
all of you who watched,

27:36.622 --> 27:39.189
and it's for you that
I visited war zones

27:39.191 --> 27:41.458
and did that bungee jump...

27:41.460 --> 27:43.693
And did the undercover
piece as a homeless woman.

27:43.695 --> 27:46.029
Yeah, you ate out of a Dumpster.

27:46.031 --> 27:48.365
And I will continue to do those things

27:48.367 --> 27:50.267
<i>with a series of specials</i>

27:50.269 --> 27:53.937
that will be coming to you
from our digital platforms.

27:53.939 --> 27:57.607
- It's the future, right?
- I tried my damnedest,

27:57.609 --> 28:02.545
but this world is just... it's
full of snakes and snares and...

28:02.547 --> 28:05.682
- Okay.
- I hope that you will wish me well.

28:05.684 --> 28:07.750
I'm sorry for these showers.

28:07.752 --> 28:10.053
Aloha, Buzzy.

28:10.055 --> 28:11.487
Aloha.

28:11.489 --> 28:14.724
Our main Jane. Come here.

28:14.726 --> 28:17.659
This is not goodbye, okay?
Not by a long shot.

28:17.661 --> 28:20.096
- Well, that's goodbye.
- Yeah.

28:20.098 --> 28:21.796
And we'll see you bright
and early Monday morning

28:21.798 --> 28:23.364
when our own Brie Ramachandran

28:23.366 --> 28:26.000
is gonna take a look at the
darker side of s'mores.

28:26.002 --> 28:27.802
- Don't wanna miss that.
- Nope.

28:27.804 --> 28:28.736
Bye, now.
