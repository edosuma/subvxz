00:33.160 --> 00:34.321
Good morning, Sire.

00:35.200 --> 00:36.406
It is time.

00:37.320 --> 00:38.320
Of course.

00:44.600 --> 00:45.806
Any news?

00:46.600 --> 00:49.080
A messenger arrived
during the night, Sire.

00:49.240 --> 00:51.891
The ship carrying Her Highness
left Calais

00:52.040 --> 00:54.964
the day before yesterday
in clement conditions.

00:55.120 --> 00:58.283
All being well, she will have arrived
in Dover by now.

01:01.560 --> 01:03.449
Was I wrong to send her?

01:04.440 --> 01:09.048
I believe His Majesty always does
what he considers best for France.

01:10.520 --> 01:12.648
And if she does not return?

01:12.800 --> 01:15.610
She will return, Sire
Of that I'm certain.

01:23.160 --> 01:26.687
- Letter for me?
- From the King of Sweden, Sire.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.207
Open it and tell me what it says.

01:32.560 --> 01:37.407
The King has agreed to end his alliance
with the Dutch and support us.

01:38.240 --> 01:40.322
Good, now all we need is England.

01:43.880 --> 01:47.202
What word of the prisoner
who tried to kill Her Highness?

01:47.960 --> 01:50.327
He's being questioned, Sire.

01:50.920 --> 01:53.810
- Tell Marchal I wish to see him.
- Yes, Sire.

02:09.639 --> 02:14.441
<i>* I'm the King of my own land,</i>

02:19.440 --> 02:22.728
<i>* Facing tempests of dust,</i>

02:22.880 --> 02:27.488
<i>* HI fight to the end,</i>

02:31.560 --> 02:37.363
* <i>Creatures of my dreams,
rise up and dance with me</i>

02:45.960 --> 02:53.960
<i>* Now and forever,
* I'm your King</i>

03:33.680 --> 03:35.489
Just so you know where you are.

03:41.520 --> 03:42.931
Well, then.

03:46.280 --> 03:48.965
Who gave you the orders to kill her?

03:49.800 --> 03:52.724
I don't know.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.243
- How did he contact you?
- I forget.

04:10.160 --> 04:12.731
Did you know that if you drive a spike

04:13.520 --> 04:16.000
through a precise spot in the skull

04:16.160 --> 04:18.970
the victim will still be able
to think and speak

04:19.120 --> 04:22.647
but will otherwise be paralyzed
for the rest of his life.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.128
- I, er...
- Yes?

04:30.440 --> 04:33.125
I never saw him.

04:33.280 --> 04:36.090
He left me a note.
Always in a different place.

04:54.280 --> 04:56.487
Where were you before
joining my police?

04:57.160 --> 04:58.321
I worked in a tavern

04:58.480 --> 05:01.165
- You know who William of Orange is?
- No.

05:01.320 --> 05:03.322
- Are you scared?
- Of what?

05:03.480 --> 05:06.051
Do you visit him
or does he come to France?

05:06.200 --> 05:07.964
- Who?
- William of Orange?

05:08.120 --> 05:09.406
Mmm, I don't know him.

05:09.560 --> 05:11.642
- Where's this tavern?
- In the South.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.729
- Be very scared.
- Of what?

05:13.880 --> 05:15.609
- Does he give you money?
- Who?

05:15.760 --> 05:19.003
- William of Orange.
- I'm telling you I don't know him

05:19.480 --> 05:21.528
I've never even been to Holland.

05:24.840 --> 05:26.683
Who said he was from Holland?

05:28.080 --> 05:30.606
You did though, didn't you?

05:34.360 --> 05:35.805
The King wants you.

05:38.440 --> 05:40.010
Immediately.

05:56.400 --> 06:00.041
Don't take your eyes off him,
talk to him or give him anything.

06:07.560 --> 06:08.891
Welcome Your Highness

06:09.040 --> 06:11.088
- And your journey?
- Pleasant enough

06:11.520 --> 06:12.965
I apologise in advance

06:13.120 --> 06:15.851
the castle is a bit chilly
at this time of year.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.162
It's just the King
I shall be seeing?

06:18.320 --> 06:21.449
The Lords Arlington and Arundel
will be in attendance.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.648
May I see His Majesty

06:23.800 --> 06:27.282
before the official discussions begin,
in private?

06:27.440 --> 06:30.808
I fear not, Your Highness
That would be most irregular.

06:31.080 --> 06:33.970
Mmm, of course.

06:41.920 --> 06:45.322
I was not made for this
I don't have the courage.

06:45.480 --> 06:48.563
You'll find the courage
in the doing of it Your Highness.

06:48.720 --> 06:51.007
Is something amiss,
Your Highness?

06:52.480 --> 06:53.845
Not at all.

07:04.960 --> 07:09.329
His Majesty is in conference
and will be with you shortly.

07:09.480 --> 07:10.686
Thank you.

07:46.640 --> 07:48.802
Where's Marchal?
The King needs him

07:48.960 --> 07:50.450
Already gone, sir.

07:56.840 --> 07:59.571
So that is the traitor?

08:00.800 --> 08:02.962
But Monsieur Marchal told us..

08:03.680 --> 08:07.446
If I had my way,
I'd have you hung, drawn and quartered.

08:10.920 --> 08:12.524
How gruesome.

08:14.880 --> 08:18.168
- What's this for?
- For killing people.

08:20.680 --> 08:23.126
- Killing people?
- Sir, please.

08:24.560 --> 08:25.686
Killing them thus?

08:33.000 --> 08:37.289
A guard is expecting you by the laundry
room. He'll show you the exit.

08:37.799 --> 08:40.530
You will visit
our mutual friend in Paris.

08:40.679 --> 08:44.401
And tell him I want
the 20 best men at his disposal.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.561
You will take them to the usual place
and await my instruction.

08:51.200 --> 08:52.200
Thank you.

08:58.880 --> 09:01.486
Minette,

09:02.200 --> 09:05.443
my dear younger sister!

09:05.600 --> 09:07.489
Brother!

09:09.840 --> 09:13.925
Last time I saw you, you thought
a ghost hiding under your bed!

09:14.080 --> 09:16.651
I hope you got rid of it!

09:17.320 --> 09:20.767
I come not as your sister
but as an emissary of France.

09:21.640 --> 09:22.846
I see.

09:24.600 --> 09:28.764
Well, no matter.
I am pleased to see you.

09:30.440 --> 09:33.046
Now then down to business.

09:33.520 --> 09:35.841
We have seen
your King's proposals

09:36.000 --> 09:39.322
and I fear
I cannot accept them in their entirety.

09:40.160 --> 09:42.162
He seems to see England as a small

09:42.320 --> 09:45.051
and insignificant neighbour
with no ambitions.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.650
He wishes us to stand by

09:47.800 --> 09:51.247
while he invades Holland
and steals their trade.

09:52.160 --> 09:53.685
This is unacceptable.

09:54.680 --> 09:58.002
He proposes to aid us
in our in our relations with the Pope

09:58.160 --> 10:00.083
but with what guarantee?

10:01.120 --> 10:04.203
In short his proposals

10:04.360 --> 10:07.489
lean too heavily in France's favour.

10:24.080 --> 10:25.650
How much do you want?

10:27.280 --> 10:28.281
I beg your pardon?

10:29.880 --> 10:31.291
You are bankrupt.

10:34.920 --> 10:36.490
Ah, what a charming thought

10:36.960 --> 10:41.045
Six years ago the City of London
was struck by plague.

10:41.600 --> 10:45.127
Two years later
it was destroyed by fire.

10:45.280 --> 10:46.964
You are bankrupt.

10:48.040 --> 10:49.690
But prefer not to admit it.

10:51.600 --> 10:52.600
I ask again.

10:54.520 --> 10:55.646
How much?

10:56.800 --> 10:59.963
This is really not
how one conducts these matters.

11:00.120 --> 11:02.521
It is how I conduct them.

11:03.320 --> 11:04.162
My dear sister

11:04.320 --> 11:07.961
I prefer you to address me
as Your Highness.

11:17.560 --> 11:20.131
We had in mind something

11:20.280 --> 11:22.931
in the region of 500,000
per month for a year.

11:23.680 --> 11:24.442
In return..

11:24.600 --> 11:27.410
300 per month for six months.

11:27.560 --> 11:31.565
One can do so little with
300,000 crowns.

11:32.080 --> 11:34.890
Furthermore, we will provide
a personal armed guard

11:35.040 --> 11:36.530
of 5,000 men.

11:36.680 --> 11:39.809
A personal guard?
Whatever for?

11:40.600 --> 11:42.807
To protect your head, brother.

11:45.560 --> 11:48.450
You're certain
it's William of Orange behind this?

11:48.600 --> 11:50.602
Without doubt, Sire.

11:52.120 --> 11:54.407
You'll get
the truth from the prisoner?

11:54.760 --> 11:57.491
I will extract all that he knows, Sire.

11:57.640 --> 12:00.450
However, it is unlikely
he knows everything.

12:01.200 --> 12:04.807
His masters will ensure
he only knows what's necessary.

12:05.640 --> 12:07.768
I wish to speak with him myself.

12:28.840 --> 12:32.208
Guard every exit! Form a search party!

12:32.360 --> 12:34.931
Send men
to every tavern and whorehouse.

12:35.080 --> 12:37.447
Alert our agents
in Paris and OrlÃ©ans.

12:38.760 --> 12:39.886
Now!

12:48.160 --> 12:50.003
This is unfortunate.

12:51.120 --> 12:54.283
For me, because I'm no longer safe
in my own home.

12:54.680 --> 12:58.207
For France because William of Orange
will soon wear her crown

12:58.360 --> 13:00.328
And for my head of Security

13:00.480 --> 13:03.131
because it's not
the first time he's failed

13:03.280 --> 13:05.851
and he no longer has the trust
of his employer

13:20.920 --> 13:23.571
It's true, Sire,
that I consider Mr Marchal

13:23.720 --> 13:26.087
to be driven more
by violence than reason,

13:26.240 --> 13:29.767
I do believe him to be
a man of trust and integrity.

13:29.920 --> 13:32.366
- He has failed me.
- He has, Sire.

13:32.520 --> 13:35.763
But believe me, without him
Your Majesty wouldn't be alive.

13:48.080 --> 13:49.366
On reflection

13:50.960 --> 13:54.169
I am willing to accept
His Majesty's offer.

13:54.920 --> 13:57.764
You will return to France
with the treaty signed

13:57.920 --> 13:59.729
I'm gratified to hear it.

13:59.880 --> 14:02.850
You are sure I can trust him, Minette?

14:03.000 --> 14:04.286
Of course.

14:04.840 --> 14:07.127
You share the same ambitions.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.044
I hardly think so.

14:09.480 --> 14:12.962
Louis wishes to place himself
at the center of the universe.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.406
I do not.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.004
He wants to be known
to posterity as a great King.

14:18.160 --> 14:21.881
- Not you?
- No, my ambitions are more modest.

14:22.040 --> 14:25.726
I wish to be known as a King
who did no harm to anyone.

14:27.280 --> 14:28.725
How thoughtless of me.

14:28.880 --> 14:32.851
- I forgot to ask how you were.
- I am well, thank you.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.368
- Do you miss England?
- I miss my brother.

14:37.200 --> 14:39.521
When he's not trying
to humble his sister

14:41.880 --> 14:44.850
The sun IS the center!

14:45.480 --> 14:48.882
The heart, the mother
of the universe.

14:49.400 --> 14:53.325
Without its warmth and light
all life is gone.

14:53.480 --> 14:56.165
Man will cease to exist.

14:56.960 --> 14:59.611
One could believe
he's talking about you.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.049
Perhaps you could apply
the measurement to France?

15:05.560 --> 15:07.927
The topography of France
is already begun.

15:08.080 --> 15:09.080
Splendid!

15:09.160 --> 15:12.164
Let's hope the size of our holdings
isn't overblown.

15:12.320 --> 15:14.288
I regret, Sire

15:14.600 --> 15:17.410
the preliminary results indicate

15:17.560 --> 15:20.564
that France is not so big as we thought.

15:22.400 --> 15:24.402
You mean to subtract
with your sums

15:24.560 --> 15:27.530
the lands I gained in war
in the Spanish Netherlands?

15:28.840 --> 15:32.049
No one can argue with the truth, Sire.

15:32.680 --> 15:34.444
Not even a King.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.284
I bow before the power
of scientific truth.

15:58.720 --> 15:59.846
Brother!

16:08.480 --> 16:10.926
I confess to being disappointed in you.

16:11.400 --> 16:12.049
Why?

16:12.200 --> 16:14.885
I asked you to take charge
of court etiquette.

16:15.040 --> 16:18.249
You promised to think of it
but they seem to go nowhere.

16:18.400 --> 16:21.483
You know well,
your proposition doesn't interest me.

16:21.640 --> 16:23.608
It wasn't really a proposition.

16:24.480 --> 16:26.323
I suggest you think again.

16:26.480 --> 16:30.007
In the hope that this time
your thinking bears fruit.

16:32.480 --> 16:35.848
Her Higness is expected
to return tomorrow, Sire

16:36.880 --> 16:38.370
I'm relieved to hear it.

16:40.880 --> 16:42.041
As am l.

16:46.880 --> 16:49.611
You were always
good at cards as a child.

16:49.760 --> 16:52.525
I cheated. But you never noticed.

16:52.920 --> 16:54.331
Now he tells me.

16:56.360 --> 16:58.283
'Course you wouldn't dare to now.

16:58.440 --> 17:00.363
I fear there's no need.

17:02.040 --> 17:04.849
His Majesty scores 88 points.

17:05.200 --> 17:07.806
Lord Rohan, 103.

17:07.960 --> 17:10.770
His Majesty owes Lord Rohan
25,000 francs.

17:10.920 --> 17:13.320
- Another'?
- Very well.

17:16.920 --> 17:18.001
Yes?

17:22.359 --> 17:26.648
My men have searched
the palace, the village and surroundings

17:27.560 --> 17:29.324
The prisoner has long gone.

18:33.760 --> 18:36.047
I owe you two million francs
my friend.

18:36.640 --> 18:37.971
You'll receive them

18:38.120 --> 18:41.203
in the morning. Now,
if you'll excuse me, I'm weary.

18:41.360 --> 18:43.488
- My King...
- Sire,

18:44.280 --> 18:45.725
it is by no means certain

18:45.880 --> 18:50.090
that we have 2 million francs,
here at the palace.

18:50.560 --> 18:53.370
Then my reign
will be shorter than I'd have liked.

18:56.200 --> 18:59.329
Please allow me to recoup your losses,
Sire.

19:00.680 --> 19:03.843
Should you succeed,
you'll know where to find me.

19:57.440 --> 20:00.250
I believe this is what was used

20:00.400 --> 20:03.643
to poison your father and me.

20:08.160 --> 20:09.730
Where did you find it?

20:10.680 --> 20:12.330
In a Lady's dress.

20:37.240 --> 20:38.924
Without doubt a poison.

20:40.960 --> 20:42.405
Oleander.

20:46.840 --> 20:50.084
Do you know the
person who made this?

20:50.600 --> 20:52.170
All too well.

21:02.440 --> 21:04.249
Sorry to disturb you, Sire.

21:04.400 --> 21:07.085
But Madame insisted on seeing you.

21:07.680 --> 21:10.411
Thank you. Please leave us.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.525
Am I still King?

21:23.040 --> 21:25.964
Still King.
Still my master.

21:27.400 --> 21:29.368
How did you subdue your enemy?

21:29.880 --> 21:31.484
By Playing a silly girl,

21:31.640 --> 21:34.325
by using my feminine wiles and

21:34.480 --> 21:36.482
by being better than him.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.411
Feminine wiles?

21:40.680 --> 21:41.841
I'm jealous.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.651
No reason.

21:47.680 --> 21:49.682
Perhaps you should use them on me.

21:52.640 --> 21:54.404
Your wish is my command.

22:17.400 --> 22:19.721
Can't remember when I was last hungry.

22:19.880 --> 22:23.851
What did the King mean about etiquette?

22:25.840 --> 22:28.241
Some idea of his to make me look a fool.

22:29.160 --> 22:30.571
He wants me to make rules

22:30.720 --> 22:33.121
telling people how to behave at court.

22:34.640 --> 22:36.722
He wants to turn us into puppets.

22:38.880 --> 22:41.121
- Is it such a bad idea?
- Yes.

22:41.640 --> 22:44.166
I think it's possible

22:45.440 --> 22:46.851
you underestimate him.

22:48.200 --> 22:52.285
And may potentially allow envy
to blind you to his talents.

22:52.440 --> 22:54.010
I do not underestimate him.

22:54.160 --> 22:56.242
I merely see him as he is.

22:57.600 --> 22:59.284
No better way to keep control

22:59.440 --> 23:01.841
than by dictating
their words and movement.

23:02.360 --> 23:03.360
Brilliant.

23:05.240 --> 23:06.240
If you say so.

23:06.680 --> 23:08.808
Besides he gave me back to you.

23:11.280 --> 23:13.089
You mean I'm indebted to him?

23:15.160 --> 23:16.160
Yes, my dear.

23:17.400 --> 23:19.129
It must be torture for you.

23:23.760 --> 23:25.205
What are you doing?

23:25.360 --> 23:28.011
Getting paper. And a quill.

23:28.840 --> 23:30.285
- What for?
- My darling

23:30.440 --> 23:34.684
we're going to turn the nobles
of Versailles into obedient servants.

23:35.800 --> 23:39.122
From now, everyone will know
how to be from dawn 'til dusk.

23:39.520 --> 23:43.764
How to walk, how to talk,
how to address a man or a woman

23:43.920 --> 23:46.321
how to sit and where.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.811
How to behave in front of the King.

23:51.240 --> 23:54.961
And you, my stallion
will be the master of ceremonies.

23:57.600 --> 23:58.600
You're mad.

24:02.120 --> 24:03.485
Let's be mad together.

24:08.880 --> 24:12.601
With your permission
I will deal with her as I see fit.

24:14.080 --> 24:16.367
You would have her tortured?

24:16.520 --> 24:20.445
No, I fear that would give her
more pleasure than pain.

24:28.600 --> 24:29.806
And the daughter?

24:31.320 --> 24:34.529
If she were involved,
Your Highness would be dead.

24:35.520 --> 24:38.364
Everywhere,
I see the hand of William of Orange.

24:38.800 --> 24:41.770
He seeks to undermine our alliance
with England.

24:42.240 --> 24:45.323
Perhaps this failure
will put an end to his efforts.

24:45.480 --> 24:46.686
On the contrary.

24:47.800 --> 24:50.246
It will only encourage him.

25:03.720 --> 25:05.688
William of Orange, Your Majesty.

25:19.840 --> 25:22.764
I understand a ship,
sporting French colours

25:22.920 --> 25:24.684
left port a few days ago.

25:27.400 --> 25:31.041
Yes, I believe a cargo
of wine and cheese recently arrived.

25:31.200 --> 25:34.682
From what I'm told its cargo
was never destined for a banquet.

25:36.560 --> 25:39.131
Well, I shall make
some inquiries then.

25:39.520 --> 25:41.249
No need for that. I'd like

25:41.400 --> 25:45.200
what the French King's sister-in-law
was doing here.

25:47.320 --> 25:48.810
Visiting her brother.

25:50.040 --> 25:51.963
Do they not do so in Holland?

25:53.040 --> 25:56.931
You see if I were Louis
and I wanted to attack Holland

25:57.080 --> 26:00.209
the first thing I'd do
is approach her allies.

26:00.360 --> 26:02.283
Tell Sweden to turn a blind eye

26:02.440 --> 26:04.169
and convince England to join.

26:05.880 --> 26:09.089
And what would I offer in return?
Money!

26:11.400 --> 26:14.563
And whom would I send?
A seasoned diplomat?

26:14.720 --> 26:18.008
Or perhaps someone very close
to the King of England.

26:18.160 --> 26:21.403
Someone you would naturally trust.

26:23.080 --> 26:25.481
Your argument would carry much weight

26:26.320 --> 26:28.687
but for one glaring weakness.

26:28.840 --> 26:29.840
Which is?

26:30.160 --> 26:34.563
Would I join forces with Louis
and attack the Dutch?

26:35.200 --> 26:37.646
If I were proposing
a marital alliance

26:37.800 --> 26:40.007
to the man soon to be
King of Holland.

26:41.760 --> 26:44.047
I don't understand.

26:57.600 --> 26:59.568
You've not met your first cousin.

27:00.160 --> 27:02.845
My niece, Mary, before.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.844
No, it's an honor.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.924
Mary is looking for a husband.

27:09.080 --> 27:12.926
And you, I believe, a wife.

27:21.560 --> 27:23.642
You're from the South, Sophie?

27:24.320 --> 27:25.845
Near Pau, Your Highness.

27:26.960 --> 27:28.200
Do you miss it?

27:28.360 --> 27:30.362
No, my place is here.

27:31.200 --> 27:34.283
You are seduced perhaps
by dreams of a good marriage.

27:35.200 --> 27:39.683
Power, fortune,
perhaps even a place next to the King.

27:40.280 --> 27:41.691
Oh, well... um.

27:42.040 --> 27:45.010
Don't worry, we all are.

27:49.080 --> 27:50.445
Beware, Sophie.

27:51.320 --> 27:54.051
You live in the most exciting place
in the world.

27:54.560 --> 27:57.040
But it's easy to lose yourself in it.

27:58.280 --> 28:01.329
The most important thing of all
is to belong.

28:02.560 --> 28:05.006
Don't you belong at Versailles,
Your Highness?

28:27.040 --> 28:28.804
Does His Majesty know of this?

28:29.240 --> 28:30.969
It was His Majesty's idea.

28:32.040 --> 28:33.040
I see.

28:35.360 --> 28:38.842
We rely on you to pass it
to everyone in the palace.

28:39.400 --> 28:41.129
And anyone who is seen

28:41.280 --> 28:43.760
transgressing the rules of etiquette

28:44.320 --> 28:45.924
shall be sanctioned.

28:49.360 --> 28:53.046
I fear they may balk at such
an imposition on their daily lives.

28:53.600 --> 28:57.969
Sooner or later even the wildest horse
accepts the halter.

29:00.320 --> 29:01.446
Very well.

29:08.240 --> 29:10.208
We now have a base for munitions

29:10.360 --> 29:12.362
in Dunkirk, Courtray, Lille, Brisach

29:12.520 --> 29:14.727
Pignerol, Metz and Thionville.

29:16.240 --> 29:19.483
- Enough for how long?
- For a six month campaign, Sire.

29:20.880 --> 29:23.804
Very good. Start preparing troops.

29:24.760 --> 29:25.966
Already, Sire?

29:28.440 --> 29:31.569
I want them in uniform
and ready for battle by spring.

29:31.720 --> 29:33.449
Very well, Sire.

29:43.840 --> 29:45.080
Thank you, Sire.

29:45.640 --> 29:49.361
Is it now customary for the monarch
to perform a servant's task?

29:50.520 --> 29:52.841
We are all servants of France
are we not?

29:55.640 --> 29:58.211
- How was England?
- Cold

29:59.560 --> 30:01.130
I've never been to England

30:01.480 --> 30:05.451
but I'm told it rains perpetually
and its people forever apologise.

30:05.800 --> 30:09.646
I'm sorry to contradict His Majesty
but that is a myth.

30:09.800 --> 30:11.245
Hmm.

30:52.520 --> 30:54.887
- Hello, mother.
- Hello, dear.

30:55.400 --> 30:58.802
Mother, Her Highness has promised
to present me to Mr De Quercy.

30:59.640 --> 31:02.928
She says he'd be a good match.
Imagine, me a duchess!

31:03.560 --> 31:05.085
No longer a builder?

31:07.320 --> 31:09.448
You told me to forget him, remember?

31:11.120 --> 31:13.600
- What are you doing?
- I've lost a brooch.

31:13.760 --> 31:15.410
No something's wrong.
What?

31:15.560 --> 31:16.560
No, nothing.

31:20.560 --> 31:22.562
What's the news of our situation?

31:23.480 --> 31:25.244
I believe soon to be resolved.

31:25.400 --> 31:27.721
If I marry a duke
we'd be safe, won't we?

31:27.880 --> 31:29.006
Yes. Don't forget

31:29.720 --> 31:31.324
where we're from.

31:33.720 --> 31:36.087
Mother, the day we left

31:36.240 --> 31:38.481
you wished me a happy trip to England.

31:39.360 --> 31:41.203
How did you know I was going?

31:41.360 --> 31:44.091
Oh, you know, court gossip.

31:45.680 --> 31:47.409
You're hiding something.

31:49.240 --> 31:53.131
If I'm hiding anything from you
it's for good reason.

31:55.360 --> 31:59.046
"The two Kings will declare war
against the provinces of Holland.

31:59.760 --> 32:02.127
"The King of France will attack by land.

32:02.280 --> 32:05.648
"And receive the help
of 6,000 men from England.

32:06.240 --> 32:08.811
"The King of England will send
50 men-of-war.

32:08.960 --> 32:10.689
"And the King of France thirty.

32:11.600 --> 32:14.410
"His Britannic Majesty
will receive Walcheren,

32:14.560 --> 32:17.211
"the mouth of the Scheldt and Cadzand

32:17.360 --> 32:19.840
"as his share
of the conquered provinces.

32:20.320 --> 32:24.120
"The King of England will publicly
profess the catholic faith

32:24.280 --> 32:26.931
"and will receive 2 million crowns

32:27.080 --> 32:29.367
"in the course of the next six months".

32:30.880 --> 32:33.406
We were ready to go
to three millions

32:33.560 --> 32:35.289
I wasn't.

32:39.280 --> 32:41.408
This calls for a celebration.

32:42.880 --> 32:45.724
Tomorrow. In the meantime
you must rest.

32:52.560 --> 32:55.291
- May I ask how you feel?
- A little weary

32:56.520 --> 32:57.681
Sleep and repose.

32:57.840 --> 33:01.162
She must have broth for a week
with sorrel and rosemary.

33:01.320 --> 33:02.606
Yes, of course.

33:08.760 --> 33:11.491
If the King says you're a man,
you're a man.

33:13.560 --> 33:15.642
It's not necessary.

33:26.360 --> 33:30.206
Mr Marchal,
I was hoping I might see you.

33:30.960 --> 33:34.203
- I wonder, might I have a word.
- Of course.

33:35.440 --> 33:37.010
You see

33:38.920 --> 33:43.005
I conceived the notion
you're upset with me.

33:43.600 --> 33:45.568
Why would I be upset with you?

33:50.240 --> 33:52.561
Because I lied about who I am.

33:55.680 --> 33:56.886
Mmm.

33:57.040 --> 33:59.884
The paper you used was of Swiss origin.

34:00.040 --> 34:04.011
And not available in France at the time
you claimed to have been born.

34:06.080 --> 34:08.686
I underestimated you.

34:09.600 --> 34:11.250
Why would you lie to me?

34:13.360 --> 34:15.089
Because I was scared.

34:17.920 --> 34:19.001
I care for you.

34:20.760 --> 34:23.603
You see, I first came to court

34:23.760 --> 34:26.525
intending to find a match
for my daughter.

34:28.199 --> 34:32.603
Then I discovered yet another
reason to stay here.

34:38.400 --> 34:40.721
Have you found someone
for your daughter?

34:41.440 --> 34:42.804
No, not yet.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.161
But may I ask what you intend for us?

34:47.679 --> 34:49.762
You won't have us banished, will you?

34:51.159 --> 34:53.322
Hmmm.

34:53.760 --> 34:54.761
<i>No,</i>

34:55.560 --> 34:58.803
I'm sure the matter
will be resolved favorably.

35:01.200 --> 35:02.850
Good.

35:16.280 --> 35:17.520
Hmm,

35:18.600 --> 35:20.568
What news from court?

35:21.160 --> 35:24.130
Every speaks
of the masked ball tomorrow.

35:24.280 --> 35:25.361
Thank you.

35:26.680 --> 35:30.241
- What is your name again?
- Marie, Your Highness.

35:31.800 --> 35:33.086
Thank you, Marie.

35:40.800 --> 35:42.404
What will you be wearing?

35:42.920 --> 35:45.321
I don't know, I can't decide.

35:46.800 --> 35:49.201
I remember my first masked ball.

35:49.680 --> 35:53.401
I danced all evening with a tall man
wearing the mask of Apollo.

35:54.440 --> 35:58.001
At the end of the evening
he took me out onto the terrace,

35:58.960 --> 36:01.008
kissed each of my fingers,

36:02.520 --> 36:03.520
and then left.

36:05.040 --> 36:06.371
Well, who was he?

36:07.000 --> 36:10.243
To this day I do not know.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.923
And will Your Highness be going?

36:13.240 --> 36:16.562
I don't think so, I'm a little tired.

36:17.120 --> 36:19.441
But it is in your honor, Your Highness.

36:19.600 --> 36:21.921
His Majesty will be disappointed.

36:41.760 --> 36:42.921
Good morning!

36:44.040 --> 36:45.451
What are doing here?

36:45.600 --> 36:47.967
I'm here to watch a piece of theatre.

36:48.600 --> 36:50.250
- In my bedroom
- Yes.

36:50.400 --> 36:52.164
It's called the Grand Lever.

36:52.320 --> 36:54.004
A comedy of manners with

36:54.840 --> 36:56.251
tragic undertones.

37:15.280 --> 37:16.280
From now on

37:17.280 --> 37:19.044
your life is not yours.

37:20.680 --> 37:23.923
All you do is designed to be seen
and admired.

37:24.840 --> 37:27.320
Dressing, shaving, drinking and eating.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.729
They are no longer actions;

37:29.880 --> 37:31.450
but a performance.

37:33.800 --> 37:35.006
All the noblemen

37:35.160 --> 37:38.243
are required to present themselves
at the appointed hour

37:38.400 --> 37:40.880
Dukes before Marquis, I believe.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.405
I'm with the duke.

37:44.280 --> 37:48.330
Only a few will however be given
the privilege of entering,

37:48.480 --> 37:51.006
observing, and, in some cases,
participating.

37:52.160 --> 37:55.289
All the entries and exits
will be supervised.

37:55.440 --> 37:58.887
Self control and order are paramount.

37:59.520 --> 38:02.808
Where two valets used to dress you,
you now have six.

38:03.240 --> 38:05.561
For your shoes: two.

38:05.920 --> 38:08.730
Everything you do is
a display of wealth.

38:09.200 --> 38:12.283
Authority, harmony and modesty.

38:13.400 --> 38:17.246
And last, but by no means least, piety.

38:23.080 --> 38:25.481
Mass at eleven. Don't be late!

38:26.320 --> 38:28.084
I must congratulate you brother

38:28.400 --> 38:31.563
it's a perfect system where everyone
knows their place.

38:31.720 --> 38:32.801
I really know mine.

39:06.520 --> 39:07.851
Where are you going?

39:09.200 --> 39:10.531
To save us.

39:26.760 --> 39:29.604
- Madame De Clermont?
- Yes.

39:30.680 --> 39:33.126
Monsieur Marchal sent me.
He awaits you

39:33.640 --> 39:34.801
Follow me please.

39:37.280 --> 39:40.124
- Where is he?
- He wishes it to be a surprise.

40:18.360 --> 40:19.964
Approach no further.

40:22.400 --> 40:24.323
I'm not sure I quite understand.

40:27.080 --> 40:28.241
In a forest

40:29.960 --> 40:31.849
looking down a row of evergreens.

40:37.200 --> 40:38.565
You remembered.

40:41.880 --> 40:43.689
So this is it, isn't it?

40:47.080 --> 40:48.127
Kneel.

40:58.120 --> 40:59.201
Kneel down.

41:16.640 --> 41:17.766
Look at me.

41:28.320 --> 41:29.890
What do you see?

41:33.520 --> 41:34.726
I see..

41:37.280 --> 41:38.805
I see loneliness.

41:40.680 --> 41:42.011
I see fear.

41:45.520 --> 41:46.601
I see

41:49.320 --> 41:52.324
despair, regret.

41:54.080 --> 41:55.650
And duty.

41:57.560 --> 41:58.891
Let it be done.

42:26.560 --> 42:28.164
What are you doing?

42:29.920 --> 42:33.641
- You're looking for my mother
- No, I'm looking for you.

42:34.400 --> 42:37.529
- Why?
- To tell you to leave.

42:40.160 --> 42:42.686
- I do not understand
- I think you do.

42:42.840 --> 42:46.049
Pack up your affairs and get out.
You have no place here.

42:46.920 --> 42:48.331
What about my mother?

42:48.480 --> 42:52.166
You'll be making the journey back
to where you come from alone.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.004
And if I find you still here
I'll have you tossed out.

42:58.160 --> 43:00.083
What have you done with her?

43:22.440 --> 43:23.601
Your son, Sire.

43:25.440 --> 43:26.487
Very good.

43:32.560 --> 43:35.131
His Majesty wishes you to stay.

43:45.520 --> 43:49.161
You're here because the time
has come to teach you how to rule.

43:52.440 --> 43:55.364
To be a King is to have power
beyond imagining.

43:57.360 --> 44:01.081
All you ask shall be given.
All you desire will be yours.

44:02.320 --> 44:06.086
You will have power
but with power comes duty.

44:06.720 --> 44:09.371
Duty to your subjects, to your friends

44:09.840 --> 44:12.491
to justice, to truth.

44:13.360 --> 44:15.647
But with power also comes danger.

44:16.160 --> 44:19.209
When I was young boy,
some sought to destroy us.

44:20.360 --> 44:22.249
People we took to be friends.

44:22.400 --> 44:27.088
They hammered at our doors, with blood
stained hands and murder in their hearts

44:31.200 --> 44:33.282
It'll never happen to you.
I promise.

44:35.480 --> 44:38.051
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

44:40.040 --> 44:41.041
Good.

44:43.480 --> 44:47.041
Rohan, my son
will be spending a few days.

44:47.200 --> 44:49.441
I will teach him how to rule a country.

44:49.600 --> 44:52.001
And you will teach how to hunt a boar.

44:53.680 --> 44:55.205
It would be an honor.

45:07.840 --> 45:10.810
- Are my orders...?
- Yes, sir. The men are ready

45:10.960 --> 45:13.691
Good. I'll leave a message
at the usual place.

45:13.840 --> 45:16.491
- When?
- When the time has come.

45:17.120 --> 45:20.010
Then what is the plan?
We shall capture the King?

45:20.160 --> 45:23.687
No, the King is not our prey.

45:35.080 --> 45:37.287
- Madam.
- Lord Rohan.

45:37.440 --> 45:40.762
- Another game of cards later perhaps?
- With pleasure.

45:51.040 --> 45:53.441
Not joining the revelry,
Monsieur Marchal?

45:53.600 --> 45:55.364
I prefer to watch.

45:55.520 --> 45:57.090
I'm sure you do.

46:18.280 --> 46:20.965
- This is an unwelcome surprise.
- I came to

46:21.440 --> 46:22.930
make you an offer.

46:23.080 --> 46:25.606
- Of what?
- Of me?

46:28.280 --> 46:31.807
Life as a builder's wife
was unpalatable?

46:32.680 --> 46:34.250
He would not take me.

46:34.400 --> 46:36.562
Mmm, a wise man.

46:37.280 --> 46:40.284
So, I am your only hope.

46:40.440 --> 46:42.488
And you've come to me
for deliverance

46:44.600 --> 46:46.204
You have courage.

46:47.400 --> 46:51.166
And value.
I'm unmarried and pure.

46:52.480 --> 46:54.847
At least you are seen to be.

46:56.040 --> 46:57.929
Which is all that matters here.

47:00.200 --> 47:01.406
Very well.

47:04.040 --> 47:07.761
If you wish to stay here
you will work for me.

47:09.320 --> 47:12.688
Everyone, apart the King and I
believe you of noble birth.

47:12.840 --> 47:14.604
This will remain the case.

47:15.920 --> 47:19.402
You will attend court, dance, flirt,

47:19.560 --> 47:22.609
gossip, play cards, seduce

47:24.200 --> 47:27.249
but henceforth you will do it
in my service.

47:28.480 --> 47:31.450
You will tell me what people are doing

47:31.600 --> 47:33.250
what they are saying

47:33.920 --> 47:35.968
who is sharing a bed with whom

47:36.120 --> 47:39.169
who is cheating on their wife
and who cheats at cards.

47:40.240 --> 47:44.643
If you disobey me, you will suffer
the same fate as your mother.

47:46.240 --> 47:50.370
From now on I own you.
That is my offer.

47:53.280 --> 47:54.486
Very well.

48:33.280 --> 48:36.887
- Why this color?
- Because it's regal.

48:38.040 --> 48:39.040
I hate it!

48:39.120 --> 48:42.124
Some people care
about making an impression.

48:42.960 --> 48:45.406
Hrmphh. Clearly.

48:49.480 --> 48:51.050
Two minds that think as one

48:51.200 --> 48:54.249
- Would you have me change masks?
- Not at all.

48:54.400 --> 48:55.447
Come.

49:00.960 --> 49:02.291
I wanted to thank you.

49:02.440 --> 49:05.284
- What for?
- For sharing my vision.

49:05.440 --> 49:06.965
Often I had the impression

49:07.120 --> 49:10.169
the petty differences between us
were insurmountable.

49:10.320 --> 49:13.688
- I'm sure the fault is all mine.
- Not entirely.

49:17.160 --> 49:18.650
It is magnificent.

49:19.640 --> 49:21.563
Some would still destroy it.

49:21.720 --> 49:24.929
- My dear brother I've spoken to him.
- Not your friend.

49:25.400 --> 49:29.166
I'm talking of forces far stronger
and more determined.

49:31.760 --> 49:34.809
- Who?
- I do not yet know.

49:35.560 --> 49:37.244
But they are close.

50:18.640 --> 50:21.610
Ah, the princess
we've been waiting for.

50:22.600 --> 50:24.250
Do you know your King?

50:24.400 --> 50:26.607
- Is it me?
- Or is it me?

50:27.240 --> 50:31.131
- Which one do you want it to be?
- I cannot say.

50:31.280 --> 50:34.363
She cannot say oh dear!

50:35.240 --> 50:37.561
- You'll dance with me I hope.
- I will.

50:37.960 --> 50:40.725
- Why not with me?
- She shall dance with us both.

51:02.080 --> 51:04.082
His Majesty's in a flattering mood

51:04.240 --> 51:05.969
What makes you say so?

51:06.120 --> 51:08.771
Because I know him.
And he knows you.

51:13.920 --> 51:16.844
It strengthens me to know
I have you at my side.

51:17.640 --> 51:21.645
You have many advisors
better qualified than I.

51:22.840 --> 51:25.446
You are so much more
than a mere advisor.

51:28.640 --> 51:30.768
You realise he no longer loves you.

51:30.920 --> 51:33.048
Yet you still lie awake at night.

51:33.760 --> 51:35.728
And dream of his footsteps

51:36.160 --> 51:38.288
and midnight knock at the door.

51:42.880 --> 51:45.042
You were and are my first love

51:45.200 --> 51:48.090
whoever I'm with, a part
will always be with you

51:48.680 --> 51:50.967
He'll promise and beckon
and you'll hope.

51:52.400 --> 51:53.811
What a wonderful queen.

51:53.960 --> 51:56.201
He'll promise and beckon...

51:56.360 --> 51:58.522
Part of me will always...

51:58.680 --> 51:59.761
Just a puppet now...

51:59.920 --> 52:01.763
You'd have made
a wonderful queen.

52:01.920 --> 52:05.163
You were and are my first love...
