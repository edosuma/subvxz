00:12.581 --> 00:16.334
I believe that something
comes to get you.

00:16.335 --> 00:18.050
When you pass away.

00:18.051 --> 00:19.319
Nurse!

00:19.320 --> 00:21.222
It was evil.

00:21.223 --> 00:25.543
I know that I saw the Angel of Death.

00:26.586 --> 00:28.948
It's gonna take me.

00:28.949 --> 00:31.469
What is that?

00:32.534 --> 00:35.319
Jeannie, it's the girl!

00:35.320 --> 00:38.080
This was death...

00:39.806 --> 00:42.506
Paying him back.

00:47.249 --> 00:48.583
[Machine beeping]

00:48.584 --> 00:51.306
[Indistinct radio chatter]

00:51.307 --> 00:53.887
[Siren wailing]

01:02.338 --> 01:05.462
I always heard that medical
professionals make the worst patients.

01:05.464 --> 01:06.754
[Breathing heavily]

01:06.755 --> 01:11.675
That's true, because I
made the worst patient.

01:12.073 --> 01:16.153
I'm an emergency medical technician.

01:18.793 --> 01:23.473
I had recently had
gastric bypass surgery...

01:25.256 --> 01:29.336
And something had gone really wrong.

01:30.237 --> 01:33.339
I went through the hospital doors.

01:33.340 --> 01:37.972
Being an E.M.T., normally
I would walk through...

01:37.973 --> 01:43.433
But this time, I was on a
cart, going in feet-first.

01:47.454 --> 01:51.114
This time, I was the patient.

01:54.123 --> 01:57.663
I was admitted to I.C.U...

01:58.666 --> 02:03.106
And they started running a lot of tests.

02:03.470 --> 02:07.010
I knew that it was serious.

02:07.210 --> 02:09.142
So I was very scared.

02:09.143 --> 02:10.676
[Machine beeping]

02:10.678 --> 02:12.838
[Panting]

02:18.082 --> 02:22.121
Going in to see him for the
first time was very upsetting.

02:22.122 --> 02:27.894
Here's my strong husband, who's normally
the caregiver, laying there helpless.

02:27.895 --> 02:30.055
[Panting]

02:30.130 --> 02:31.831
Sir, that's my husband right there.

02:31.832 --> 02:33.819
What's going on?

02:33.820 --> 02:38.980
The doctor said, well,
his kidneys have shut down.

02:39.974 --> 02:42.050
Being married to an E.M.T.,

02:42.051 --> 02:46.813
I know that somebody's kidneys
failing is not a good thing.

02:46.814 --> 02:48.854
[Cries]

02:50.922 --> 02:55.989
The thought of losing Mike at the
time was more than I could bear.

02:55.990 --> 02:57.657
Our kids were young.

02:57.658 --> 03:00.426
There were things he needed
to do with these kids.

03:00.427 --> 03:02.707
[Sniffling]

03:03.130 --> 03:05.830
[Machine beeping]

03:10.771 --> 03:16.591
On Memorial Day, my stepfather
Darrell had a massive stroke.

03:18.058 --> 03:23.650
When we arrived at the hospital, they
immediately started working on him.

03:23.651 --> 03:26.351
[Machine beeping]

03:30.290 --> 03:33.927
They had already said he probably
would not make it through the night.

03:33.928 --> 03:35.929
- Mom.
- Tonya.

03:35.930 --> 03:36.930
What happened?

03:36.931 --> 03:39.298
Honey, pops had a massive stroke.

03:39.299 --> 03:42.301
My daughter Tonya arrived at the I.C.U.

03:42.302 --> 03:45.536
[Crying] I don't know if he's
gonna make it or not, Sweetie.

03:45.537 --> 03:48.574
- He'll be okay.
- All I could do was hug her.

03:48.575 --> 03:51.177
We didn't know whether he was
dead or alive at that point.

03:51.178 --> 03:54.838
[Cries] He's barely breathing.

03:55.482 --> 04:00.687
Nobody should be hooked up to that much
machinery just to breathe, just to live.

04:00.688 --> 04:02.689
It'll be okay.

04:02.690 --> 04:04.590
Hey, how you doing?

04:04.591 --> 04:08.254
My job at the hospital
as an I.T. Technician.

04:08.255 --> 04:11.798
Is crucial to the patient
and the patient's care.

04:11.799 --> 04:15.301
So I have to get into that room there...

04:15.302 --> 04:19.879
A patient's life could be in jeopardy
if you don't get it right the first time.

04:19.880 --> 04:21.749
[Sighs]

04:21.750 --> 04:26.629
If a patient is on their death
bed and there's family around...

04:26.630 --> 04:29.921
I try to just give them their space.

04:29.922 --> 04:31.350
The computer can wait.

04:31.351 --> 04:32.986
Yeah, it's not a good time.

04:32.987 --> 04:37.487
I'll come back and do it tomorrow, okay?

04:41.495 --> 04:45.815
I work by myself at night quite often.

04:49.087 --> 04:52.005
I'm not scared of the night shifts.

04:52.006 --> 04:57.906
I'm there to help the doctors.
I'm there to help the nurses.

05:00.082 --> 05:05.962
With my office being in the
basement, close to the Morgue...

05:06.320 --> 05:10.460
I do see the bodies in the gurneys.

05:12.940 --> 05:17.017
Generally, the door's shut, but every
once in a while, you catch a glimpse...

05:17.018 --> 05:21.627
Of what's going on in the
Morgue, and, uh, it's not...

05:21.628 --> 05:25.228
It can be kind of frightful.

05:27.241 --> 05:30.763
This is, like, the biggest
stroke a person can have.

05:30.764 --> 05:34.580
- Thanks.
- So how is he? No change?

05:34.581 --> 05:36.482
[Machine beeping]

05:36.483 --> 05:42.383
The doctors put a hole right here
in his throat and installed a Trach.

05:44.391 --> 05:46.559
He looked dead.

05:46.560 --> 05:49.328
I don't even think the doctors
expected for him to come back.

05:49.329 --> 05:51.330
[Machine beeping]

05:51.331 --> 05:53.971
[Dramatic music]

05:54.501 --> 05:56.867
[Machine beeping rapidly]

05:56.868 --> 05:58.638
Mom.

05:58.639 --> 06:00.740
[Breathing heavily]

06:00.741 --> 06:05.411
He was looking around the room like,
you know, where am I? Type thing.

06:05.412 --> 06:07.820
You're awake?

06:07.821 --> 06:12.018
You just look into somebody's
eyes, and you can see fear.

06:12.019 --> 06:14.187
[Muttering]

06:14.188 --> 06:17.290
His eyes were as big as saucers.

06:17.291 --> 06:18.792
[Choking]

06:18.793 --> 06:20.794
He was just angry.

06:20.795 --> 06:23.435
[Dramatic music]

06:23.730 --> 06:28.530
He was fighting something
in his own world...

06:29.369 --> 06:33.506
Because in my world, there
was nothing in that room.

06:33.507 --> 06:35.787
[Muttering]

06:35.876 --> 06:37.543
[Groans]

06:37.544 --> 06:42.882
My stepfather was not always
a very kind person in life.

06:42.883 --> 06:44.717
He did some bad things.

06:44.718 --> 06:46.552
[Machine beeping]

06:46.553 --> 06:49.133
I felt like...

06:49.389 --> 06:52.149
This was death...

06:53.127 --> 06:55.827
Paying him back.

07:03.170 --> 07:09.008
I got called in to come change a
computer in the operating rooms.

07:09.009 --> 07:11.064
During the day, you
can't really get in there.

07:11.065 --> 07:14.965
There's people being operated on.

07:17.561 --> 07:19.745
Met up with Security.

07:19.746 --> 07:21.955
Everything had been shut down.

07:21.956 --> 07:25.016
Bare minimal lighting.

07:27.898 --> 07:31.331
And I'm looking at the computer and
trying to figure out the problem.

07:31.332 --> 07:34.512
[Computer keys clicking]

07:40.241 --> 07:42.881
[Dramatic music]

07:46.213 --> 07:49.983
Something just caught my attention.

07:49.984 --> 07:51.450
Hello?

07:51.451 --> 07:53.253
I don't know what that was.

07:53.254 --> 07:55.714
Anyone there?

07:58.004 --> 08:03.884
I'm just trying to get my job
done and get it done right.

08:07.368 --> 08:10.008
[Dramatic music]

08:18.279 --> 08:19.413
As I'm working...

08:19.414 --> 08:20.802
[Beeping]

08:20.803 --> 08:24.505
I hear, b-beep, b-beep, b-beep.

08:24.506 --> 08:27.029
That sound... it's not
coming from the computer.

08:27.030 --> 08:28.521
Where is it coming from?

08:28.522 --> 08:30.682
[Beeping]

08:42.068 --> 08:45.340
You could see the heart monitor going,
t-joot, you know, t-joot, t-joot...

08:45.341 --> 08:48.101
With a heartbeat.

08:48.575 --> 08:51.244
I can tell you that
these heart monitors...

08:51.245 --> 08:56.405
They don't go off without
a body attached to it.

08:57.189 --> 09:03.089
You've got to have a flesh-and-blood
body attached to these electrodes.

09:04.867 --> 09:07.687
Something's wrong.

09:11.999 --> 09:14.953
He was in I.C.U...

09:14.954 --> 09:16.569
[Muttering]

09:16.570 --> 09:21.023
Just out of the clear blue, he
says, you know, hey, Aunt Evie.

09:21.024 --> 09:23.424
Aunt Evie...

09:32.102 --> 09:37.075
And I looked around, and there was
nobody in the room but me and him.

09:37.076 --> 09:41.036
Pop, who are you talking to, pop?

09:41.116 --> 09:43.996
[Groans] Uncle Bob.

09:44.136 --> 09:47.496
How's the garden growing?

09:48.082 --> 09:49.602
That's when I realized...

09:49.603 --> 09:51.283
[Muttering]

09:51.284 --> 09:54.639
Aunt Evie and Uncle Bob...

09:54.640 --> 10:00.400
Was his Aunt and Uncle that
had been dead for many years.

10:02.447 --> 10:06.107
I never even knew the people.

10:07.354 --> 10:09.146
[Machine beeping]

10:09.147 --> 10:12.507
I knew something's wrong.

10:12.585 --> 10:14.727
I'm pushing buttons.

10:14.728 --> 10:18.684
There's got to be a logical
explanation for this.

10:18.685 --> 10:21.160
[Beeping stops]

10:21.161 --> 10:22.834
And then it just stops.

10:22.835 --> 10:25.238
[Metal clanking]

10:25.239 --> 10:28.059
I hear clanking...

10:29.876 --> 10:32.336
I look up...

10:32.513 --> 10:37.116
I realize, you know, it was the surgical
tools next to the operating table.

10:37.117 --> 10:39.997
[Clanking continues]

10:43.290 --> 10:45.930
[Dramatic music]

10:57.204 --> 10:59.844
[Clanking stops]

11:03.459 --> 11:07.959
I have never been so spooked in my life.

11:14.307 --> 11:20.207
Every shadow, every light were
creeping me out from that point on.

11:24.398 --> 11:28.418
I didn't really want to be there.

11:30.237 --> 11:35.877
I wanted to hurry up and
get my work done and go home.

11:37.744 --> 11:40.384
[Dramatic music]

12:04.738 --> 12:06.111
I looked up...

12:06.112 --> 12:07.066
[Gasps]

12:07.067 --> 12:10.727
I see this black, misty mass.

12:11.495 --> 12:14.015
What is that?

12:25.324 --> 12:26.653
[Dramatic music]

12:26.654 --> 12:29.174
What is that?

12:30.630 --> 12:34.261
And within a second and a half,
it shot up into the ceiling.

12:34.262 --> 12:36.962
[Machine beeping]

12:38.648 --> 12:43.028
I was laying in bed in a lot of pain.

12:44.424 --> 12:50.324
And I kind of caught something
out of the corner of my eye.

12:51.119 --> 12:54.753
It was kind of a shadow, dark-type...

12:54.754 --> 12:56.734
Thing.

12:57.320 --> 13:03.220
Kind of like, you would think, a ghost,
but not white... it was... it was a black.

13:03.254 --> 13:05.873
It was going somewhere...

13:05.874 --> 13:09.387
Like it was looking for something.

13:09.388 --> 13:10.780
It's okay.

13:10.781 --> 13:12.746
My mom was ran ragged.

13:12.747 --> 13:15.027
Wore down.

13:15.616 --> 13:19.096
I told my mom I'd go in.

13:20.288 --> 13:22.988
[Machine beeping]

13:26.160 --> 13:28.440
I heard...

13:28.539 --> 13:30.730
This little
pss-pss-pss-pss-pss-pss.

13:30.731 --> 13:33.791
[Indistinct whispering]

13:33.968 --> 13:37.704
Had no idea where it was coming from.

13:37.705 --> 13:41.308
Had no idea who was doing it.

13:41.309 --> 13:44.311
[Indistinct whispering]

13:44.312 --> 13:46.952
[Dramatic music]

13:49.117 --> 13:53.320
I can hear him kind of
mumbling a little bit.

13:53.321 --> 13:55.421
Darrell?

13:59.660 --> 14:01.628
Are you okay, Darrell?

14:01.629 --> 14:04.723
- Darrell?
- No! Leave me alone!

14:04.724 --> 14:08.401
- I am not ready to go.
- No! You get away from me!

14:08.402 --> 14:11.838
And all I could think
was, who was he talking to?

14:11.839 --> 14:13.373
[Yelling]

14:13.374 --> 14:16.576
He's squirming around the bed like
this, and, stop that! Get away from me!

14:16.577 --> 14:19.846
I'm not ready to go!
No, no! It's not my time!

14:19.847 --> 14:25.585
He was speaking to something or
someone that was in that room with us.

14:25.586 --> 14:28.488
- No, no!
- The look on his face...

14:28.489 --> 14:31.115
Something was there for him...

14:31.116 --> 14:32.916
No!

14:32.999 --> 14:35.262
And it was torturing him.

14:35.263 --> 14:36.796
- No!
- Mom!

14:36.797 --> 14:39.077
[Muttering]

14:39.667 --> 14:41.767
No, no!

14:42.166 --> 14:43.670
Hey, hey, pop...

14:43.671 --> 14:47.507
Just all of a sudden,
it was, get me a bat!

14:47.508 --> 14:49.042
Give me a bat! Give me a bat!

14:49.043 --> 14:51.678
Get away, you son of a
bitch! I'm not ready to go!

14:51.679 --> 14:53.947
I'm going back!

14:53.948 --> 14:58.334
The arm kept doing this, as if he was...

14:58.335 --> 15:02.122
Hitting at something,
or swatting it away.

15:02.123 --> 15:03.857
[Muttering]

15:03.858 --> 15:06.460
He was fighting with it.
He was struggling with it.

15:06.461 --> 15:09.529
Trying to get it away from him.

15:09.530 --> 15:12.119
- Get it off me!
- Hey, hey!

15:12.120 --> 15:13.200
Get away, you son of a...

15:13.201 --> 15:14.801
The machine couldn't keep up with him.

15:14.802 --> 15:16.403
[Machine beeping rapidly]

15:16.404 --> 15:19.944
- Calm down.
- Nurse! Nurse!

15:20.126 --> 15:24.344
It was like something was physically
sitting on top of his chest.

15:24.345 --> 15:27.514
Give me a bat. I'll bash his head in.

15:27.515 --> 15:29.249
- Calm down.
- Get away, get away, no!

15:29.250 --> 15:31.451
No, no, no, no!

15:31.452 --> 15:33.086
No, no, no!

15:33.087 --> 15:37.054
What was there in that
room, was in that room.

15:37.055 --> 15:41.495
And it was for him, and I wasn't
about to have a part of it.

15:41.496 --> 15:43.463
[Machine beeping]

15:43.464 --> 15:45.399
It was evil. That's what it seemed like.

15:45.400 --> 15:48.040
[Dramatic music]

15:54.342 --> 15:56.866
I got out of the operating room.

15:56.867 --> 16:00.224
And I turned the corner,
and I'm going down...

16:00.225 --> 16:04.365
The very dark and desolate hallway...

16:09.657 --> 16:12.233
This weird feeling...

16:12.234 --> 16:14.754
Came over me.

16:16.931 --> 16:19.571
I just stopped.

16:19.783 --> 16:23.503
Just an eerie, weird feeling...

16:24.338 --> 16:25.539
Right behind me.

16:25.540 --> 16:28.480
[Indistinct shouting]

16:28.543 --> 16:31.183
[Dramatic music]

16:32.180 --> 16:34.114
[Loud bang]

16:34.115 --> 16:37.475
I was extremely terrified.

16:43.524 --> 16:46.344
I turned around...

16:50.030 --> 16:53.150
And that black mist...

16:53.667 --> 16:58.287
That black shape is
coming back up at me.

17:02.076 --> 17:06.156
It was chasing me down the hallway.

17:09.030 --> 17:11.760
[Cell phone rings]

17:11.761 --> 17:14.722
I'm turning the corner,
my cell phone goes off.

17:14.723 --> 17:16.990
[Cell phone ringing]

17:16.991 --> 17:19.924
I take my phone out...

17:19.925 --> 17:23.345
- Hello?
- [Garbled speech]

17:27.694 --> 17:30.154
I look up...

17:33.071 --> 17:35.308
And the Morgue door is open.

17:35.309 --> 17:38.429
Why is the door open?

17:39.989 --> 17:43.769
There was a body on the table.

17:45.224 --> 17:47.278
Standing right behind...

17:47.279 --> 17:49.739
Was a woman.

17:50.497 --> 17:54.757
She was staring at her own dead body.

17:58.227 --> 18:02.127
I knew I had just seen a ghost.

18:02.637 --> 18:05.277
[Dramatic music]

18:11.945 --> 18:16.025
I didn't feel like sticking around.

18:23.391 --> 18:26.331
I ran very quickly.

18:29.053 --> 18:33.013
I can't believe what I just saw.

18:33.501 --> 18:36.636
I stopped at the end of the ramp.

18:36.637 --> 18:39.037
I'm winded.

18:40.575 --> 18:44.342
That was the scariest thing I've ever...

18:44.343 --> 18:46.623
Ever seen.

18:47.848 --> 18:53.052
You talk about stuff of
this nature in a hospital...

18:53.053 --> 18:58.953
The first thing they're going to do
is take you up to the Mental Ward.

19:04.098 --> 19:07.649
I had been working at the hospital
in the psychiatric wing for...

19:07.650 --> 19:11.730
Oh, my God, about nine years total.

19:12.206 --> 19:14.610
I enjoyed my job.

19:14.611 --> 19:18.645
The patients did like me. We
got along very well together.

19:18.646 --> 19:24.284
After a while, it's kind of
like they they become family.

19:24.285 --> 19:29.615
Time I get to work, it's,
like, about 6:35 in the morning.

19:29.616 --> 19:31.858
One of my favorite patients
at the hospital was Mark.

19:31.859 --> 19:33.641
- How's it going?
- Good.

19:33.642 --> 19:36.214
Down here early this morning.

19:36.215 --> 19:37.785
I came down early.

19:37.786 --> 19:40.099
I was gonna go punch in.
He asked me for a cigarette.

19:40.100 --> 19:41.707
Have you got a cigarette, Ron?

19:41.708 --> 19:44.029
Sure, why don't we go out to the porch?

19:44.030 --> 19:46.310
Let's go.

19:48.254 --> 19:50.646
I gave Mark a cigarette.

19:50.647 --> 19:55.310
You know, when I was a kid, we used
to fish in that stream all the time.

19:55.311 --> 19:57.951
It's beautiful.

19:58.420 --> 20:02.289
And I looked at my watch, and
I seen it was about 8 to 7:00.

20:02.290 --> 20:05.830
I gotta punch in, you know?

20:07.423 --> 20:13.003
So I reach down, died out
my cigarette on the ground...

20:14.067 --> 20:18.567
And that's when this thing came upon me.

20:19.924 --> 20:24.364
This thing had to be about 7 feet tall.

20:26.244 --> 20:29.999
This black mist has hit me so fast...

20:30.000 --> 20:32.940
I couldn't breathe.

20:33.587 --> 20:36.587
Damn it, I'm dying.

20:46.180 --> 20:50.509
It was if somebody had
a vice around your heart.

20:50.510 --> 20:53.510
I felt myself going.

20:57.333 --> 20:59.385
I was dying.

20:59.386 --> 21:01.486
[Grunts]

21:03.477 --> 21:05.144
It started to pass.

21:05.145 --> 21:08.325
I was able to breathe.

21:08.384 --> 21:13.844
And as it finally passed,
I turned to look at Mark...

21:14.789 --> 21:16.709
What?

21:16.927 --> 21:19.283
Mark was gone.

21:19.284 --> 21:24.204
He was, like, there one
minute, gone the next.

21:24.512 --> 21:30.412
The only thing that I found that was
left there was the cigarette that he had.

21:32.015 --> 21:35.675
I thought maybe Mark might
have taken off to get somebody.

21:35.676 --> 21:40.296
Because that's the
kind of person he was.

21:41.454 --> 21:43.743
- So I went in...
- [Exhales deeply]

21:43.744 --> 21:47.337
And next thing you know, one of
the night shift came downstairs.

21:47.338 --> 21:50.456
One of the patients, you
know, apparently passed away.

21:50.457 --> 21:54.417
Yeah, sure. I can help with that.

21:59.522 --> 22:02.005
Oh, hey, Ron. Can you sign this for me?

22:02.006 --> 22:03.306
Yeah, sure, Doc.

22:03.307 --> 22:08.343
The doctor asked me if I would sign
the verification of I.D. of the patient.

22:08.344 --> 22:12.930
You can see, and plainly,
estimated time of death was...

22:12.931 --> 22:15.811
6:30 that morning.

22:16.158 --> 22:19.993
I signed my name, and so the
doctor said to me, well...

22:19.994 --> 22:23.325
- You have to look at the body.
- You have to see the body, Ron.

22:23.326 --> 22:24.893
Right. Sorry, Doc.

22:24.894 --> 22:27.534
[Dramatic music]

22:30.935 --> 22:33.395
It was Mark.

22:34.673 --> 22:36.140
It can't be.

22:36.141 --> 22:38.341
It can't be.

22:38.342 --> 22:40.679
Mark died of a massive heart attack.

22:40.680 --> 22:46.080
He just died at 6:30, and
I was outside with him...

22:46.204 --> 22:49.134
You know, at about ten
of, having a cigarette.

22:49.135 --> 22:51.420
Ten minutes ago just...

22:51.421 --> 22:54.107
Less than ten minutes ago we
were outside and having a...

22:54.108 --> 22:57.930
Had a cigarette on the back porch.

22:57.931 --> 23:00.871
Ron, I'm so sorry.

23:04.757 --> 23:06.792
I know I wasn't talking to myself.

23:06.793 --> 23:08.189
I know I was with him.

23:08.190 --> 23:11.430
He was physically there.

23:13.432 --> 23:19.252
It's impossible for somebody
to be two places at one time.

23:19.803 --> 23:25.703
I went up to the coffee shop to, you
know, to unwind and gather my thoughts.

23:30.543 --> 23:32.641
- The priest was coming down.
- Hello, Ron.

23:32.642 --> 23:35.701
And I said, Father,
do you have a minute?

23:35.702 --> 23:38.642
Of course, come on.

23:39.225 --> 23:43.341
What I'm gonna tell you, I said, you're
going to find it very hard to believe.

23:43.342 --> 23:45.743
Tell me what's going on.
That's what I want to know.

23:45.744 --> 23:48.079
I just had a cigarette
with him downstairs.

23:48.080 --> 23:53.118
I told him about having the
cigarette on the porch with Mark.

23:53.119 --> 23:58.909
He said when Mark died, I felt
part of Mark's heart attack.

23:58.910 --> 24:01.790
You felt his pain.

24:02.246 --> 24:06.243
He said, it's a rare occurrence,
but what you came in touch with,

24:06.244 --> 24:12.144
that's what we call, in the Catholic
religion, the Angel of Death.

24:12.705 --> 24:16.174
Ron, you... you've experienced death.

24:16.175 --> 24:19.715
And it was coming for Mark.

24:22.281 --> 24:28.119
I believe that the person who I was
talking to on the porch was Mark's spirit.

24:28.120 --> 24:33.820
When this mist came, it was
coming for Mark, not for me.

24:34.260 --> 24:36.960
[Machine beeping]

24:40.799 --> 24:43.735
After a while, my stepfather Darrell...

24:43.736 --> 24:46.136
He gave up.

24:46.739 --> 24:48.874
The body started deteriorating.

24:48.875 --> 24:51.542
[Beeping continues]

24:51.543 --> 24:56.823
So the doctor ordered the
hospice nurse to come in.

24:59.185 --> 25:01.253
I'm a hospice nurse.

25:01.254 --> 25:03.495
Have been for seven years.

25:03.496 --> 25:07.616
- Good morning.
- My job can be difficult.

25:07.617 --> 25:10.943
Because we have to care for
the patient that's passing away

25:10.944 --> 25:13.808
as well as the families and their needs.

25:13.809 --> 25:15.530
[Door opens]

25:15.531 --> 25:17.035
Priscilla?

25:17.036 --> 25:20.105
- Yeah.
- Hi, I'm Vickie.

25:20.106 --> 25:21.506
Nice to meet you.

25:21.507 --> 25:24.543
I remember walking into the
room the very first time,

25:24.544 --> 25:28.679
and there was Darrell, and he was
laying on his bed, and he was sick.

25:28.680 --> 25:33.851
Well, I will take over from here,
and you can go and get some rest.

25:33.852 --> 25:35.287
Great.

25:35.288 --> 25:39.161
I did not tell Vickie anything
that had been happening there,

25:39.162 --> 25:44.315
because I was afraid that she would
either leave or have me locked up.

25:44.316 --> 25:46.963
- Thanks.
- Okay.

25:46.964 --> 25:51.502
The first thing she needed
to do was go get some rest.

25:51.503 --> 25:52.904
It was my time now.

25:52.905 --> 25:55.605
[Machine beeping]

25:58.873 --> 26:01.579
It was just Mr. Darrell and myself.

26:01.580 --> 26:03.860
[Muttering]

26:05.584 --> 26:08.719
It looks like he was
wrestling with something.

26:08.720 --> 26:11.000
[Muttering]

26:11.115 --> 26:14.345
And I thought that
maybe he just was one of

26:14.346 --> 26:18.269
those kind of guys that's
not gonna go down easy.

26:18.270 --> 26:20.550
[Muttering]

26:23.269 --> 26:25.489
[Shouting]

26:25.571 --> 26:27.731
[Moaning]

26:31.861 --> 26:35.646
He's gonna fight it until
he can't fight anymore.

26:35.647 --> 26:38.347
[Machine beeping]

26:41.653 --> 26:46.213
And I was sitting
there reading a book...

26:49.561 --> 26:54.481
I felt this chill sort
of come into the room.

26:59.674 --> 27:03.514
And it just kept getting colder.

27:07.380 --> 27:13.260
I don't think the thermostat
had been lowered or anything...

27:13.852 --> 27:18.532
But the atmosphere had
changed in the room.

27:31.034 --> 27:36.934
The hairs on the back of my neck
and on my arm sort of stand up.

27:37.203 --> 27:38.843
[Shivers]

27:38.844 --> 27:44.424
And you can feel like someone
has walked into the room.

27:48.016 --> 27:52.216
My eye was distracted to this shadow.

27:54.578 --> 28:00.098
I'm feeling something in
the room that I can't see...

28:02.835 --> 28:05.775
But I can feel it.

28:07.080 --> 28:09.900
I'm in a room...

28:10.181 --> 28:13.781
With my dying patient, alone.

28:14.439 --> 28:18.699
And something has entered to the room.

28:21.563 --> 28:24.479
I pull my chair over to
the side of his bed...

28:24.480 --> 28:26.760
[Muttering]

28:27.769 --> 28:30.529
I take his hand.

28:30.713 --> 28:33.035
And I pray for him.

28:33.036 --> 28:34.932
I pray for his family.

28:34.933 --> 28:36.834
[Shouting]

28:36.835 --> 28:40.075
[Machine beeping rapidly]

28:43.159 --> 28:45.711
He was wrestling with something.

28:45.712 --> 28:47.932
[Shouting]

28:48.832 --> 28:51.483
Like, trying to get
something off of him.

28:51.484 --> 28:53.704
[Shouting]

29:01.144 --> 29:05.164
I'm thinking that he's in pain...

29:06.399 --> 29:10.204
So I gave him another
dose of pain medicine.

29:10.205 --> 29:14.539
Which was almost, like, twice of
what you would normally give somebody.

29:14.540 --> 29:17.180
[Dramatic music]

29:20.844 --> 29:24.752
Instead of him calming
down, he got more...

29:24.753 --> 29:27.185
Of this moving of the
head and the hands.

29:27.186 --> 29:29.009
[Muttering]

29:29.010 --> 29:33.090
This was unlike anything
that I had experienced before.

29:33.091 --> 29:36.331
[Machine beeping rapidly]

29:37.072 --> 29:39.846
The Lord is my Shepherd,
I shall not want...

29:39.847 --> 29:42.847
I got out my Bible.

29:44.437 --> 29:49.330
I felt like that was something that
could help me and Darrell at that time.

29:49.331 --> 29:53.678
He makes me lie down
in the green pastures...

29:53.679 --> 29:55.279
[Groaning]

29:55.280 --> 29:59.317
I can't say whether it
was a Demon or a ghost.

29:59.318 --> 30:00.385
[Shouting]

30:00.386 --> 30:04.356
Even though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death...

30:04.357 --> 30:07.559
But I do know that it
was something there...

30:07.560 --> 30:09.126
Thou hast anointed me.

30:09.127 --> 30:11.347
[Groaning]

30:11.597 --> 30:14.332
That I could not see...

30:14.333 --> 30:17.301
And I will dwell in the house...

30:17.302 --> 30:19.270
And it was there for him.

30:19.271 --> 30:21.491
[Groaning]

30:35.965 --> 30:38.005
Vickie?

30:44.764 --> 30:46.931
Are you okay?

30:46.932 --> 30:51.252
I knew that we needed to have a chat.

30:51.837 --> 30:54.597
We need to talk.

30:56.133 --> 30:58.242
She is a hospice nurse.

30:58.243 --> 31:01.726
She deals with death every day.

31:01.727 --> 31:05.475
But she did make the
remark to me that...

31:05.476 --> 31:09.550
The torment that he was enduring
by something in that room,

31:09.551 --> 31:13.271
was like nothing she had seen.

31:14.259 --> 31:18.431
Priscilla was relieved to
have someone else to say...

31:18.432 --> 31:21.349
Yes, I saw it. Yes, I felt it.

31:21.350 --> 31:23.134
Yes, I know it's there.

31:23.135 --> 31:25.955
[Breathing heavily]

31:29.145 --> 31:35.045
I was still in intensive care, and still
in a considerable amount of discomfort.

31:36.798 --> 31:39.283
It was nighttime.

31:39.284 --> 31:43.724
I had my mask on, and had the I.V.'s.

31:47.660 --> 31:50.840
And all of a sudden...

31:51.994 --> 31:54.694
I saw a shadow.

31:55.784 --> 31:58.269
And it had form. It was a physical...

31:58.270 --> 32:01.240
[Machine beeping rapidly]

32:01.241 --> 32:04.984
It was actually walking into my room.

32:04.985 --> 32:08.813
I felt like I couldn't breathe.

32:08.814 --> 32:12.183
I was pushing everything
I had to call anybody.

32:12.184 --> 32:13.728
[Groaning]

32:13.729 --> 32:16.754
The only thing that came through
the door was the dark, black figure.

32:16.755 --> 32:18.975
[Groaning]

32:19.600 --> 32:21.993
And the only thing that was
running through my mind is...

32:21.994 --> 32:23.294
[Choking]

32:23.295 --> 32:25.329
It's gonna take me.

32:25.330 --> 32:26.430
[Gasping]

32:26.431 --> 32:32.331
It was getting closer and closer, and
I was starting to kind of get fuzzy.

32:32.905 --> 32:37.106
I kind of caught, out of
the corner of my eye...

32:37.107 --> 32:39.747
A figure, or...

32:41.179 --> 32:44.299
It was a little girl.

32:45.255 --> 32:49.086
I didn't know why she was there.

32:49.087 --> 32:51.247
[Gasping]

32:51.957 --> 32:55.317
I was gasping for breath.

32:56.028 --> 32:59.868
I was scared... scared to death.

33:17.579 --> 33:21.762
I was gasping for air,
trying to catch my breath.

33:21.763 --> 33:25.365
I looked at the little girl...

33:25.366 --> 33:28.426
And I wasn't scared.

33:29.434 --> 33:31.691
The figure left.

33:31.692 --> 33:33.071
The thing was gone.

33:33.072 --> 33:35.232
[Gasping]

33:38.147 --> 33:40.248
I hit myself in the chest.

33:40.249 --> 33:42.409
[Panting]

33:42.684 --> 33:44.904
[Coughing]

33:46.700 --> 33:51.440
And out of my mouth
came a big blood clot.

33:51.699 --> 33:53.919
[Wheezing]

33:57.183 --> 34:01.745
Probably as close as
I'll ever come to...

34:01.746 --> 34:04.206
Passing away.

34:04.946 --> 34:06.947
[Breathing deeply]

34:06.948 --> 34:09.648
[Machine beeping]

34:13.286 --> 34:19.187
I don't know if she was there to watch
over me or to make sure that I was calm.

34:20.293 --> 34:24.734
She just looked at me and
smiled, and she said...

34:24.735 --> 34:27.855
Now do you understand?

34:29.270 --> 34:32.810
And I said, understand what?

34:33.706 --> 34:36.226
She was gone.

34:46.353 --> 34:49.054
As an E.M.T...

34:49.199 --> 34:53.551
I know the difference between
hallucinations and real.

34:53.552 --> 34:56.431
And this was real.

34:57.244 --> 34:59.944
[Machine beeping]

35:04.172 --> 35:07.412
[Machine beeping rapidly]

35:09.210 --> 35:12.510
I do believe something...

35:13.250 --> 35:17.570
Was there, and it was there for him...

35:18.327 --> 35:22.767
And it had to take him the way it did.

35:23.847 --> 35:26.427
Mm, thank you.

35:34.024 --> 35:39.364
And all of a sudden, I
seen that little girl again.

35:39.626 --> 35:44.246
Back in my room,
standing next to my bed.

35:44.345 --> 35:46.865
Are you lost?

35:47.682 --> 35:50.982
What are you doing here?

35:51.172 --> 35:54.922
When I walked into the room that morning,
I thought he was talking to himself.

35:54.923 --> 35:57.257
Is everything okay?

35:57.258 --> 35:59.059
Who are you talking to, honey?

35:59.060 --> 36:01.662
I'm talking to the little girl.

36:01.663 --> 36:04.112
Um, what little girl?

36:04.113 --> 36:05.966
No little girl in here.

36:05.967 --> 36:09.480
I looked over at the chair,
and she was no longer there.

36:09.481 --> 36:11.630
There's no little girl in here.

36:11.631 --> 36:15.051
Do you see a little girl?

36:16.796 --> 36:20.514
As far as I could see, the only
thing on that chair was my purse.

36:20.515 --> 36:22.816
Baby, check out in the hallway.

36:22.817 --> 36:24.518
What?

36:24.519 --> 36:27.724
You know, she's gotta
be out here somewhere.

36:27.725 --> 36:29.645
Okay.

36:30.077 --> 36:32.777
[Machine beeping]

36:34.295 --> 36:36.797
No, no. There's no little girl.

36:36.798 --> 36:38.032
She had disappeared.

36:38.033 --> 36:43.203
I didn't see her walk out of the
room, so she evidently just vanished.

36:43.204 --> 36:45.405
He was not doped up.

36:45.406 --> 36:48.642
He was not slurring his
words. He was very lucid.

36:48.643 --> 36:50.377
Let's worry about you... how are you?

36:50.378 --> 36:51.411
A lot better.

36:51.412 --> 36:53.651
- Yeah?
- A lot better.

36:53.652 --> 36:56.326
We talked a little bit
about the little girl.

36:56.327 --> 37:02.227
I didn't know why she was there,
but she was there for a reason.

37:08.181 --> 37:14.034
The next morning when I walked in
and I saw the look on his face...

37:14.035 --> 37:18.541
The eyes were wide,
and he was to the left.

37:18.542 --> 37:24.442
He was to the left where the door was,
and he had never looked at that door.

37:26.681 --> 37:31.051
I started to wonder if something
come through the door...

37:31.052 --> 37:34.412
To tell him it was time.

37:39.160 --> 37:42.040
I grazed his face.

37:42.573 --> 37:44.996
And he was ice cold.

37:44.997 --> 37:47.000
That's when I realized he was dead.

37:47.001 --> 37:49.002
[Sighs]

37:49.003 --> 37:50.670
Death showed up.

37:50.671 --> 37:53.386
Something showed up.

37:53.387 --> 37:56.309
All of a sudden was like, it's time.

37:56.310 --> 37:59.490
[Melancholy piano music]

38:05.286 --> 38:08.700
The torture and the pain and...

38:08.701 --> 38:12.735
Every emotion that you
could possibly feel.

38:12.736 --> 38:14.956
Was over.

38:16.430 --> 38:18.431
The weight was lifted.

38:18.432 --> 38:20.706
You could exhale.

38:20.707 --> 38:24.907
For the first time, you could exhale.

38:25.774 --> 38:29.515
I've been doing hospice for seven years.

38:29.516 --> 38:33.266
And I believe that
someone comes to get you.

38:33.267 --> 38:38.187
Something comes to get
you when you pass away.

38:38.452 --> 38:41.716
I'm not afraid of it like I was.

38:41.717 --> 38:45.677
That day when I was with Darrell.

38:51.732 --> 38:56.459
A lot of times I walk away from
a death, and I go get in my car...

38:56.460 --> 38:59.700
And I cry like a baby.

39:01.957 --> 39:05.917
Because I can't take it with me.

39:06.580 --> 39:09.316
Hey, there. Thanks for everything.

39:09.317 --> 39:14.177
Eventually, my kidneys
actually started again...

39:14.445 --> 39:18.225
And I was able to... to go home.

39:18.226 --> 39:20.060
- Yeah.
- [Laughs]

39:20.061 --> 39:21.461
Whew.

39:21.462 --> 39:26.382
I was more than glad
to have my husband back.

39:28.769 --> 39:32.994
I was glad to be anywhere
other than the hospital.

39:32.995 --> 39:35.215
And we talked about
everything that had happened.

39:35.216 --> 39:38.536
I was gonna make ribs tonight, actually.

39:38.537 --> 39:40.757
Jeannie...

39:41.149 --> 39:43.909
That's the girl.

39:45.028 --> 39:47.921
Jeannie, it's the girl!

39:47.922 --> 39:51.270
It was at that moment I understood.

39:51.271 --> 39:53.465
That's when I realized...

39:53.466 --> 39:55.926
Who she was.

40:03.299 --> 40:06.539
Jeannie, it's the girl!

40:08.430 --> 40:13.019
It was at that moment I realized that
this was a girl that I'd taken care of,

40:13.020 --> 40:17.003
five years before on a 911
call that I had answered.

40:17.004 --> 40:19.483
[Siren wailing]

40:19.484 --> 40:23.444
She was unconscious, not breathing.

40:25.853 --> 40:28.904
I did everything I could to...

40:28.905 --> 40:32.205
- Save her.
- [Thunder booming]

40:32.206 --> 40:34.442
She had passed away.

40:34.443 --> 40:36.410
That was her.

40:36.411 --> 40:39.801
- Really?
- That was her in the room.

40:39.802 --> 40:42.730
The girl in the hospital
room was the same girl

40:42.731 --> 40:46.978
that I had taken care
of four years before.

40:46.979 --> 40:50.759
That little girl that I seen...

40:51.051 --> 40:54.951
Was somebody that was there to...

40:56.556 --> 41:00.216
Make everything better for me.

41:03.589 --> 41:07.309
Kind of like a guardian Angel.

41:10.738 --> 41:15.658
Every nurse has a story,
that is unexplainable.

41:16.065 --> 41:18.547
Something that they've witnessed,
something that they've seen,

41:18.548 --> 41:22.088
something that they've felt.

41:23.614 --> 41:27.775
I know that I saw the Angel of Death.

41:27.776 --> 41:30.476
In front of me.

41:31.297 --> 41:33.778
I'll swear on a stack of Bibles,
I'll take a lie detector,

41:33.779 --> 41:37.439
I know it, I know it exists.

41:38.005 --> 41:40.705
It's out there.

41:42.179 --> 41:44.732
We keep this stuff to ourselves.

41:44.733 --> 41:48.333
Because we're risking a lot.

41:48.407 --> 41:50.755
People aren't going to
pick a hospital where,

41:50.756 --> 41:56.656
people are talking about seeing
all kinds of weird things happening.

42:00.451 --> 42:04.362
Eventually everybody will
see that black figure.

42:04.363 --> 42:07.037
I know it's going to happen.

42:07.038 --> 42:10.956
But it doesn't scare me like it used to.

42:10.957 --> 42:14.159
Hopefully somebody will be
there again to help me through.
