00:09.732 --> 00:11.700
Listen, Rose,

00:11.768 --> 00:14.302
you're gonna go on
and make lots of babies,

00:14.370 --> 00:15.988
and you're gonna
watch them grow.

00:16.055 --> 00:19.374
Promise me you'll survive.

00:19.442 --> 00:22.744
Never... let go.

00:26.716 --> 00:29.217
Very nice audition.
Thank you.

00:29.285 --> 00:31.670
Thank <i>you,</i> Mr. Rivera-Perez,

00:31.754 --> 00:34.206
for writing a play
as brave as <i>Piñata Man.</i>

00:34.273 --> 00:37.175
A lowly piñata maker
who pretends to be as empty

00:37.243 --> 00:39.444
as the toys he makes.

00:39.512 --> 00:42.080
Oh!

00:42.148 --> 00:43.582
Thank you.

00:43.649 --> 00:45.517
Thank <i>you.</i>

00:48.354 --> 00:50.072
Who's next?

00:50.139 --> 00:51.773
You have my headshot, correct?

00:51.841 --> 00:53.742
Uh...

00:53.810 --> 00:55.477
yes.

00:55.545 --> 00:57.412
Excellent.

00:59.365 --> 01:01.666
Forgot to strike my prop.

01:08.608 --> 01:10.559
Then Duper said
we were out of paper clips,

01:10.626 --> 01:12.527
so I went to the supply closet,

01:12.595 --> 01:15.130
and guess what your old dad
found behind the Post-it?

01:15.181 --> 01:17.215
Had my big
audition, and...

01:18.384 --> 01:19.384
...killed it!

01:19.452 --> 01:20.619
Good for you!
That's great!

01:20.686 --> 01:22.771
Hey, I was in the middle
of a story!

01:22.839 --> 01:24.506
You found the paper clips.
Terrible story.

01:24.574 --> 01:26.224
Anyway, the director
liked me so much,

01:26.292 --> 01:28.160
I got a callback for the lead.

01:28.227 --> 01:29.861
It's the role of lifetime.

01:29.929 --> 01:31.763
Much bigger
than my voiceover work

01:31.831 --> 01:33.965
on <i>Pac-Man, the Animated Series.</i>

01:34.033 --> 01:35.801
I eat ghosts like you
for breakfast!

01:37.670 --> 01:39.237
What do you think
you're doing?

01:39.305 --> 01:40.589
That's the
big piece.
Yeah. So?

01:40.656 --> 01:43.742
The big piece goes to
the big dog, AKA me.

01:43.810 --> 01:45.544
And what makes you
the big dog?

01:45.611 --> 01:47.212
Um, everything.

01:47.296 --> 01:49.147
I'm smarter than you,
I'm stronger than you,

01:49.215 --> 01:50.699
I can wet-nurse better than you.

01:50.767 --> 01:51.833
Easy, girls.

01:51.884 --> 01:53.051
Sorry, Stan.

01:53.119 --> 01:55.303
Anything you can can do,
I can do better.

01:55.371 --> 01:56.755
I can do anything
better than you.

01:56.839 --> 01:57.989
No, you can't!
Yes, I can!

01:58.057 --> 01:59.241
No, you can't.
Yes, I can.

01:59.308 --> 02:00.776

02:06.249 --> 02:08.350
Can't we have one
meal without you two

02:08.417 --> 02:10.985
getting into an angry
singing contest?!

02:11.053 --> 02:13.472
Why is everything
a competition?

02:13.539 --> 02:16.641
Yeah, you guys should just
and get it over with.

02:16.709 --> 02:19.461
Clearly, they have repressed
sexual feelings for each other

02:19.529 --> 02:21.012
that they're channeling
into hostility.

02:21.080 --> 02:22.848
How's that Psych 101 class
going?

02:22.915 --> 02:24.149
It's only day three,

02:24.217 --> 02:25.684
but I understand
how the whole world works now.

02:25.751 --> 02:28.019
Roger, while you act in your
little community theater plays,

02:28.087 --> 02:29.604
do you know where I am?

02:29.672 --> 02:30.906
Jerkin' it?

02:30.973 --> 02:32.507
I'm on undercover
CIA missions

02:32.575 --> 02:34.342
acting for an audience
of ruthless thugs,

02:34.410 --> 02:35.944
terrorists
and assassins.

02:36.012 --> 02:37.979
And if I'm unconvincing
or forget a line,

02:38.047 --> 02:39.431
I don't get a bad review.

02:39.499 --> 02:41.032
I get a bullet to the head.

02:41.100 --> 02:42.167
Life-and-death stakes.

02:42.235 --> 02:44.402
That's real acting.

02:44.470 --> 02:46.338
Your a bad ass, Dad.

02:46.405 --> 02:49.407
You guys don't really do
that James Bond stuff.

02:49.475 --> 02:51.893
And you, that's enough from you
for the night!

02:51.961 --> 02:53.161
It's bedtime.

02:53.229 --> 02:54.729
Go to your room.

02:54.797 --> 02:56.064
Get back here.

02:56.132 --> 02:58.166
Give me a kiss.

02:58.234 --> 02:59.401
You're a good boy.

02:59.468 --> 03:02.137
You just frustrate me.

03:06.242 --> 03:08.844
So, what's on the agenda
for tonight's sleepover?

03:08.911 --> 03:11.746
Well, after pizza, we'll
retire to my tree house,

03:11.814 --> 03:15.250
watch an '80s crap fest, say
<i>Critters</i> or <i>Critters II,</i>

03:15.318 --> 03:17.819
and cap it off with a
foray into demon worship,

03:17.887 --> 03:19.204
courtesy of the
Ouija board.

03:19.272 --> 03:21.439
No! Last time
I summoned a demon,

03:21.507 --> 03:23.341
and now he won't
leave me alone.

03:25.444 --> 03:27.229
Delicious!

03:29.365 --> 03:30.866
Oh, wait, wait.

03:30.933 --> 03:32.434
You dorks still have
slumber parties?

03:33.819 --> 03:35.687
Look, they're not
slumber parties.

03:35.755 --> 03:37.255
I mean, trust me,

03:37.323 --> 03:39.891
when the four of us
get together in a bedroom,

03:39.959 --> 03:41.776
there's not much
slumbering going on.

03:47.667 --> 03:50.769
Have you ever seen the
word piñata, Miss Lopez?

03:50.836 --> 03:53.138
It has that squiggly
line over the "ñ"

03:53.206 --> 03:54.873
that looks like
an eyebrow.

03:54.941 --> 03:57.459
Or a stain
upon the soul.

03:57.526 --> 04:00.879
Oh, rehearsing for your
little play audition?

04:00.947 --> 04:03.315
Well, I have a big
undercover mission tonight

04:03.382 --> 04:05.133
where I'll be doing
some real acting.

04:05.184 --> 04:06.668
No, he doesn't.

04:06.719 --> 04:08.203
He's so lying.

04:08.271 --> 04:13.141
You know, Stanislavski says
that acting is the grandest lie.

04:13.192 --> 04:14.576
Oh!

04:21.233 --> 04:22.534
You guys ready?

04:22.602 --> 04:24.869
My mom's picking us up
in front any minute.

04:24.937 --> 04:26.504
Yeah, uh,
I just remembered.

04:26.572 --> 04:28.974
I got to go get
my circumcision touched up.

04:29.041 --> 04:33.361
And... Toshi and I have to
get to a taping of <i>Benson.</i>

04:35.665 --> 04:38.333
Wait. You're all bailing
on the sleepover

04:38.401 --> 04:40.168
because people
made fun of us.

04:40.236 --> 04:42.337
Maybe we are too old
for sleepovers.

04:42.405 --> 04:43.888
We're not kids
anymore.

04:43.956 --> 04:46.124
There's a person
inside Big Bird!

04:46.192 --> 04:47.642
But the best moments

04:47.710 --> 04:49.611
of our lives have been

You're offering me water,

How cool is this?

I don't believe he's

You're a real
actor, I'm not.

I was jealous because I
never get the cool parts

in undercover
missions.

07:50.966 --> 07:52.700
How did you get
to be so good?

07:52.767 --> 07:54.134
I had a great teacher.

07:54.202 --> 07:56.637
You should look him up,
tell him I sent you.

07:56.705 --> 07:59.106
"Irwin Beyer, Junior,
acting coach."

07:59.174 --> 08:01.141
This-this is
you, isn't it?

08:01.209 --> 08:03.277
I'm-I'm gonna get down
there, and it's gonna be you.

08:03.345 --> 08:04.945
It's a strong possibility.

08:07.465 --> 08:09.867
And I asked him,
"Mr. Antonioni,

08:09.935 --> 08:11.735
how do you
direct your actors?"

08:11.803 --> 08:13.637
And he said, "I don't.

08:13.705 --> 08:16.240
"After each take,
I simply ask them,

08:16.308 --> 08:17.841
'How did that feel?'"

08:17.909 --> 08:19.343
Ah...
Oh...
Oh...

08:19.411 --> 08:22.212
Some know.
Some... know.

08:22.280 --> 08:24.415
Now, I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

08:24.482 --> 08:27.217
I've got a callback next week
for the new play, <i>Piñata Man,</i>

08:27.285 --> 08:29.837
and since I'm going to get it,
that means no class for a while.

08:29.904 --> 08:31.972
No!
No!
No!

08:32.039 --> 08:34.408
Log that emotion,
save it for a rape scene.

08:34.476 --> 08:36.894
Okay, we still have this week.
Let's get to work.

08:36.961 --> 08:39.763
Peter and Bess, you'll be
doing a scene from <i>Hamlet.</i>

08:39.813 --> 08:41.782
Jamie and Darryl,
you'll do <i>Our Town.</i>

08:41.850 --> 08:44.234
And Stan and Stacey, I'm
giving you one of the most

08:44.302 --> 08:46.670
riveting scenes
ever put to paper:

08:46.738 --> 08:50.007
<i>WarGames,</i>
act two, scene 19.

08:50.075 --> 08:52.443
David and Jennifer,
Broderick and Sheedy

08:52.510 --> 08:54.311
are trying to flee
Goose Island

08:54.379 --> 08:56.380
to prevent global
thermonuclear war.

08:56.448 --> 08:59.616
But David's about to face
his own personal war.

08:59.684 --> 09:02.036
Tic, tac, go.

09:03.305 --> 09:04.571
Maybe we can
swim for it.

09:04.639 --> 09:07.057
No. No, I can't swim.

09:07.125 --> 09:08.859
You can't swim?
No, I can't.

09:08.927 --> 09:11.128
Okay, Wonder Woman?
I can't swim.

09:11.196 --> 09:13.380
I always thought there was
going to be plenty of time.

09:13.448 --> 09:15.616
I wish I didn't know
about any of this,

09:15.684 --> 09:17.284
and tomorrow
it would just be over.

09:17.352 --> 09:20.988
Oh, God, I really wanted
to learn how to swim.

09:21.056 --> 09:24.158
Somebody remind me
to cancel my Ambien
prescription.

09:27.512 --> 09:29.596
Okay, Stan, we're going
to run this scene

09:29.664 --> 09:31.949
all week until you
make it perfect.

09:32.017 --> 09:34.318
The rest of you will get
no attention from me,

09:34.386 --> 09:36.353
but there's no refunds,

09:36.421 --> 09:39.473
so... your move.

09:43.728 --> 09:45.262
That's the one.

09:45.330 --> 09:48.032
Those are the pajamas we should
wear for our last sleepover.

09:48.099 --> 09:49.416
I don't know.

09:49.484 --> 09:51.085
The striped ones
are better for hiding

09:51.152 --> 09:52.836
unwanted pillow
fight boners.

09:54.305 --> 09:56.223
No, no kimonos.

09:57.826 --> 10:00.044
I'm sorry, we need to get
on the same page here.

10:00.111 --> 10:02.179
Can we think about it?
You can.

10:02.247 --> 10:04.448
I can't guarantee
that the pajamas

10:04.516 --> 10:06.216
will be here
when you return.

10:06.284 --> 10:08.218
Just this morning,
there were four other boys

10:08.286 --> 10:10.120
looking at these
same very jammies.

10:10.188 --> 10:14.208
They
smacked of rich.

10:14.275 --> 10:16.009
Come on, this
guy's full of it.

10:18.630 --> 10:21.348
Yo, Deutschland,
ring those jammy-jams up,

10:21.416 --> 10:24.201
'cause we like 'em
baggy and saggy.

10:24.269 --> 10:25.836
You tell 'em,
Lil' Turtle.

10:25.904 --> 10:27.604
And you better hurry up,
'cause Lil' Vince

10:27.672 --> 10:30.707
is throwing a sleepover,
and Bindi Irwin is coming.

10:31.926 --> 10:33.277
Bam!

10:33.344 --> 10:36.497
<i>Yeah! Oh, yeah!</i>

10:36.564 --> 10:39.400
<i>Oh, yeah...</i>

10:42.153 --> 10:44.888
I really wanted
to learn how to swim.

10:47.058 --> 10:49.293
That was a fake fart,
because I couldn't summon up

10:49.360 --> 10:51.745
a real one to express
my disgust with your acting.

10:51.813 --> 10:54.114
Oh!

10:54.182 --> 10:55.416
I give up!

10:55.483 --> 10:57.284
I'll never learn how to act.

10:57.352 --> 11:00.504
Stan, you need to make
a personal connection

11:00.572 --> 11:02.539
with the character--
and you have one.

11:02.607 --> 11:04.508
Just like David doesn't know
how to swim,

11:04.576 --> 11:06.176
you don't know how to act.

11:07.412 --> 11:08.729
Stacey, I want to try

11:08.797 --> 11:09.980
something with Stan.

11:10.048 --> 11:11.148
Go get me
a butterscotch.

11:11.216 --> 11:13.050
A butterscotch what?

11:17.405 --> 11:20.140
Stan, we're going
to do this again,
but this time,

11:20.208 --> 11:23.710
I want you to exchange
the word "swim" with
the word "act."

11:25.380 --> 11:27.047
Maybe we can swim for it.

11:27.115 --> 11:31.685
No, no. I...

11:31.753 --> 11:32.719
can't act.

11:35.406 --> 11:37.774
You can't act?
No, I can't.
Okay, Wonder Woman?

11:37.842 --> 11:39.443
I can't act.

11:39.511 --> 11:41.712
I always thought there was
going to be plenty of time.

11:41.779 --> 11:43.580
I wish I didn't know
about any of this,

11:43.648 --> 11:45.449
and tomorrow it
would just be over.

11:45.517 --> 11:49.736
Oh, God... I really wanted
to learn how to act.

11:53.591 --> 11:56.910
Oh, Stan! You <i>can</i> act.

11:56.978 --> 12:00.781
Oh, you've made such progress--
such confusing progress!

12:00.849 --> 12:03.167
Okay, let's
finish the scene.

12:03.234 --> 12:05.269
Wait, we can't finish
the scene-- they kiss.

12:05.336 --> 12:07.054
So?
I'm not going to kiss you!

12:07.121 --> 12:08.739
You're... you!

12:08.806 --> 12:11.258
You can't be a great
actor unless you commit.

12:11.326 --> 12:12.759
Forget it,
I'm not kissing you!

12:12.827 --> 12:15.596
I wasn't sure, so I got
butterscotch pudding,

12:15.663 --> 12:18.415
butterscotch candy
and butterscotch morsels.

12:20.018 --> 12:22.786
Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.

12:25.256 --> 12:27.274
Pudding man!

12:32.997 --> 12:34.865
Who knows why
that didn't work?

12:37.468 --> 12:39.503
Okay, so we're all agreed.

12:39.571 --> 12:41.872
We're going to go
with the pepperoni.

12:41.940 --> 12:43.707
Oh, I don't know.

12:43.775 --> 12:46.710
Pepperoni doesn't seem
like a last sleepover pizza.

12:46.778 --> 12:48.729
You know, because
pepperoni starts out

12:48.796 --> 12:51.381
as one stick and then
you have cut it all up.

12:51.449 --> 12:55.202
I fear it sends a message
of separation more than unity.

12:55.270 --> 12:56.353
You're killing me!

12:56.421 --> 12:57.838
Don't bite my head off!

12:57.906 --> 13:00.440
Yeah, don't bite
his head off!
Shut up, Barry!

13:00.508 --> 13:02.676
You're just going to eat
all the pizza anyway.

13:02.744 --> 13:05.212
Hey, don't lob factual
statements at me

13:05.280 --> 13:06.547
as if they're insults!

13:06.614 --> 13:09.149
Can we all just calm
down and pick a pizza?

13:09.217 --> 13:11.385
You mean
can <i>you</i> pick a pizza?!

13:11.452 --> 13:13.620
You're the one pushing
for a sleepover,

13:13.688 --> 13:16.156
even though we all know
we're too old for this crap!

13:20.962 --> 13:24.865
Learn English!
Learn... English!

13:36.344 --> 13:39.296
Stop!
All of you just stop!

13:39.364 --> 13:40.964
You know what?

13:41.032 --> 13:42.766
I don't think we've
outgrown sleepovers.

13:42.834 --> 13:44.868
I think we've
outgrown each other.

13:47.372 --> 13:50.374
The all is lost moment!

13:55.246 --> 13:58.849
<i>Atención!</i>
I have the cast list.

13:58.916 --> 14:00.684
Now, when they announce me
as the lead,

14:00.752 --> 14:03.270
I want you to pop this bottle
of champagne and pound it

14:03.338 --> 14:05.639
so you work up the courage
to go buy me cocaine.

14:05.707 --> 14:07.124
Ha!
I'm going to want to celebrate.

14:07.191 --> 14:08.976
Let's start with
the male lead.

14:10.345 --> 14:13.146
A real sparkling talent.

14:13.214 --> 14:15.215
For the role
of Piñata Man...

14:16.384 --> 14:18.185
Stan Smith!

14:18.269 --> 14:20.520
What?

14:24.359 --> 14:26.193
I'd like to thank
Mr. Rivera-Perez

14:26.260 --> 14:27.928
for giving me
a last-minute audition.

14:27.996 --> 14:31.031
I'd also like to thank my acting
teacher who unknowingly

14:31.099 --> 14:33.433
trained me to steal this part
right out from under him,

14:33.501 --> 14:37.037
making me the better actor
and, once again, the big dog.

14:38.773 --> 14:41.575
The all is lost moment!

14:46.718 --> 14:48.452
You don't know what it's like

14:48.520 --> 14:50.838
to taste the pico de gallo
of a man's heart.

14:50.906 --> 14:52.339
I know too well, <i>hombre.</i>

14:52.407 --> 14:54.942
Our chips inside us
are the same, no?

14:55.010 --> 14:57.211
<i>Lo mismo.</i> Salty.

14:57.279 --> 14:59.480
Salty with tears.

15:01.099 --> 15:02.683
Would the señor
and señorita

15:02.767 --> 15:05.119
like hear about
the nacho especiale?

15:05.186 --> 15:07.988
Cut! You don't
have any lines.

15:08.056 --> 15:10.708
Stop improvising!
I need to be heard.

15:10.775 --> 15:13.043
I have 20 people
coming to see me.

15:13.111 --> 15:14.845
I'm crushing hard
on one of them.

15:14.913 --> 15:17.231
Do you know what that's
like, Mr. Rivera-Perez?

15:17.315 --> 15:18.966
You're a gay,
amateur director.

15:19.034 --> 15:21.535
You must've crushed hard
on someone along the way.

15:21.603 --> 15:24.588
Daniel? Maybe, maybe there
was a Daniel in your life?

15:31.613 --> 15:34.898
Yep... don't need anyone else
to have a good time.

15:34.966 --> 15:37.868
Just, uh, going to
entertain myself.

15:44.759 --> 15:46.076
Oh, hey, ho-- hey!

15:46.144 --> 15:47.745
Hi! Wh-What are
you doing here?

15:47.812 --> 15:50.297
We got an e-mail that
the sleepover was back on.

15:50.365 --> 15:51.699
I didn't send any e-mail.

15:51.766 --> 15:53.667
I did.

15:53.735 --> 15:54.702
Ronnie?

15:54.769 --> 15:56.403
That's right.

15:56.471 --> 15:59.573
The forgotten fifth member
of the sleepover gang.

15:59.641 --> 16:02.810
But you moved to Scottsdale
years ago. How did you...?

16:02.877 --> 16:06.714
Let's just say someone sent me
an e-mail about what went down.

16:06.781 --> 16:09.083
I understand you guys
got in a big fight.

16:10.518 --> 16:12.086
Look, you aren't mad
at each other.

16:12.153 --> 16:13.887
You're mad at growing up.

16:13.955 --> 16:15.889
And I'm mad, too.

16:15.957 --> 16:17.691
But we gotta get over it.

16:17.759 --> 16:20.961
Tonight, we gotta...
sleepover it.

16:23.565 --> 16:26.183
But first, I suggest
you all turn around

16:26.251 --> 16:29.069
so you can see
Steve's mom undressing
through that window.
