Okay, good.

00:33.207 --> 00:35.426
You can freeze that,
Miss Court Clerk.

00:36.688 --> 00:39.387
This is one of the toughest
decisions I've made

00:39.430 --> 00:43.478
because I respect
the brilliance of both of you.

00:43.521 --> 00:45.784
Go ahead and stand.

00:47.917 --> 00:50.441
Tip Top Trina
made up a dance she calls...

00:50.485 --> 00:52.574
-What was it?
-"Spanky Leg."

00:52.617 --> 00:54.184
She put it online.

00:54.228 --> 00:58.101
Soon after, a popular video game
appeared, charging money

00:58.145 --> 01:02.975
for people to have their avatar
do a similar dance.

01:03.019 --> 01:04.281
And that was called, um...

01:04.325 --> 01:06.109
What was that?

01:06.153 --> 01:08.198
"Yankee Leg."
Totally different.

01:08.242 --> 01:10.113
-And Tip Top Trina
wasn't paid a cent?
That's right.

01:10.157 --> 01:12.376
-She didn't have a copyright.
-I didn't need a copyright.

01:12.420 --> 01:14.030
I recorded it
and put it on TikTok.

01:14.074 --> 01:16.119
-Yeah, and I didn't steal it.
Okay,

01:16.163 --> 01:18.426
-well, that's not really
true, because I...
-Do you own hip-hop,

01:18.469 --> 01:20.341
-do you own tap dancing?
All right, all right,
all right. Hey, stop.

01:20.384 --> 01:21.994
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:22.038 --> 01:23.909
We're all gonna
take a breath here.

01:23.953 --> 01:26.477
Come on. Calm down.
Just breathe, please.

01:31.613 --> 01:33.180
Okay.

01:33.223 --> 01:36.096
After extensive consultation
with my court clerk,

01:36.139 --> 01:37.749
here's my decision.

01:37.793 --> 01:40.056
By the power invested in me
by absolutely no one,

01:40.100 --> 01:42.711
I find the defendant,
Garrison Vitar,

01:42.754 --> 01:45.757
committed intellectual property theft

01:45.801 --> 01:48.195
by jacking Trina's "Spanky Leg,"

01:48.238 --> 01:50.110
and must split the profits,

01:50.153 --> 01:52.895
roughly six million dollars,
fifty-fifty.

01:52.938 --> 01:53.896
-Next case.

01:53.939 --> 01:56.420
Are you fucking serious?!

01:56.464 --> 01:58.335
I am serious, Mr. Vitar.

01:58.379 --> 02:00.163
I talked to, I don't know,
six lawyers,

02:00.207 --> 02:01.643
who said Trina
does not have a case.

02:01.686 --> 02:03.993
This whole thing
is a fucking joke.

02:04.036 --> 02:05.864
One which you agreed
to, my friend.

02:05.908 --> 02:07.910
I only agreed to it because I
was promised a quick verdict.

02:07.953 --> 02:09.651
Which I gave you.

02:09.694 --> 02:11.696
Uh, just remember to leave your
moose suit and a check

02:11.740 --> 02:13.307
with Marissa on your way out.
Next case.

02:13.350 --> 02:15.309
Fuck the moose suit.
Fuck this court.

02:15.352 --> 02:16.701
And fuck you!

02:16.745 --> 02:18.573
Okay? I am, I'm suing your ass.

02:26.798 --> 02:30.585
All right, yes,
you've been subpoenaed.

02:30.628 --> 02:32.239
-Hello, Mr. Cord.
-Liz.

02:32.282 --> 02:34.066
I think we should countersue.

02:34.110 --> 02:35.764
I don't want the court's
authority undercut.

02:35.807 --> 02:37.113
Which court?

02:37.157 --> 02:39.376
-Mine.
-Yeah, well, here's the problem.

02:39.420 --> 02:41.204
Mr. Vitar is suing you
for brand disparagement.

02:41.248 --> 02:42.510
-Okay.

02:43.728 --> 02:45.774
He... uh, he is insisting
that his video game

02:45.817 --> 02:47.428
has taken a hit
in the marketplace

02:47.471 --> 02:51.258
and he wants $800,000
and your court closed.

02:51.301 --> 02:53.085
-That's overreach.
He won't get it.
He signed a contract

02:53.129 --> 02:55.087
-to abide by Hal's ruling.
Yes,

02:55.131 --> 02:58.178
and that's what we will lean on.
But almost any real judge

02:58.221 --> 03:00.223
is not gonna look kindly
on someone playing a judge.

03:00.267 --> 03:02.225
I'm not playing judge.
I am a judge.

03:02.269 --> 03:04.314
Mr. Wackner, listen to me.

03:04.358 --> 03:06.969
Your court does not have
the force of law.

03:07.012 --> 03:08.753
You can't imprison anyone.

03:08.797 --> 03:10.364
You can't force someone to pay.

03:10.407 --> 03:13.105
The court we're going to--
it does all those things,

03:13.149 --> 03:15.238
-and loves doing those things.

03:15.282 --> 03:17.588
All right, now,
if they close your doors,

03:17.632 --> 03:20.200
the police can enforce that.
You could go to jail.

03:20.243 --> 03:23.638
So, please, let me fight
this case for you. All right?

03:23.681 --> 03:25.640
Keep the craziness
and the-the fiction

03:25.683 --> 03:27.555
to a minimum,
and I can win this.

03:27.598 --> 03:29.774
But they're gonna want
to make you the focus,

03:29.818 --> 03:31.994
and if they do, we lose.

03:32.037 --> 03:34.257
So, please,
don't become the focus.

03:34.301 --> 03:35.258
How do I do that?

03:35.302 --> 03:36.651
You respect the judge.

03:36.694 --> 03:38.043
You-you wear a suit.

03:38.087 --> 03:40.176
You answer "yes" and "no"
and nothing else.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.439
-I don't own a suit.
-I can get you one.

03:42.483 --> 03:44.920
This is why I started a court.

03:45.921 --> 03:47.270
What do you think?

03:47.314 --> 03:49.446
He doesn't like
being told what to do.

03:49.490 --> 03:51.013
He'll just do the opposite.

03:51.056 --> 03:52.623
Yeah, that's what I thought.

03:52.667 --> 03:56.192
Uh, Okay, I-I need
your help, Marissa.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.193
You're my Wackner whisperer.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.803
Just keep him in line.

03:58.847 --> 03:59.891
If I can, I will.

04:04.635 --> 04:05.941
Thank you. Thank you.

04:05.984 --> 04:07.421
Everyone, please
take your seats.

04:07.464 --> 04:10.075
So, today, we have one question.

04:10.119 --> 04:13.601
How do we create more
opportunities for Black lawyers?

04:13.644 --> 04:15.472
I'd like to welcome
our panelists,

04:15.516 --> 04:17.909
leaders of the top four
Black Chicago law firms.

04:17.953 --> 04:19.520
Let's hear it
for Isaiah Drummond,

04:19.563 --> 04:22.392
founder of Dooley,
Rich and Associates.

04:24.220 --> 04:26.875
Jeff Taha, who runs
Taha and Brickman.

04:28.572 --> 04:31.271
Danny Rata, who you might
have heard of before,

04:31.314 --> 04:33.185
from Rata, Mooney, and Brock.

04:34.970 --> 04:37.015
And Diane Lockhart.

04:38.669 --> 04:41.629
So, let's talk about
opportunities for Black lawyers.

04:41.672 --> 04:42.804
Diane?

04:46.895 --> 04:48.244
Sorry.

04:50.246 --> 04:51.334
Um...

04:57.384 --> 04:59.299
Okay...

04:59.342 --> 05:01.910
-How do I stop this sound?
-What sound, sir?

05:03.433 --> 05:05.217
20 times an hour.

05:05.261 --> 05:07.307
What is it and why do I care?

05:07.350 --> 05:10.048
Dawnk. It's our new
intra-company messaging system.

05:10.092 --> 05:11.746
Why?

05:11.789 --> 05:13.269
-It's faster than email.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.315
You can have a thread
on specific topics,

05:15.358 --> 05:17.665
share documents
and reach the people you need

05:17.708 --> 05:19.536
-by tagging them.
-What do you mean, tagging?

05:19.580 --> 05:21.364
-Attaching their name.
-Like email?

05:21.408 --> 05:24.149
Why don't I just email
or find them and yell at them?

05:24.193 --> 05:26.238
The associates...
they, they prefer this.

05:26.282 --> 05:29.372
Everyone's tired of running
up and down the stairs,

05:29.416 --> 05:31.243
-hunting people down.

05:31.287 --> 05:33.637
And some of us don't love having
to deal with people directly.

05:36.466 --> 05:38.860
-Who is "Anonymous Crab?"
-If you don't sign in
with your account,

05:38.903 --> 05:41.341
the system assigns you
an anonymous avatar.

05:41.384 --> 05:42.777
Why?

05:42.820 --> 05:45.214
It's meant to foster
free communication.

05:46.520 --> 05:47.825
"How the hell did this..."

05:47.869 --> 05:49.349
...happen?

05:49.392 --> 05:51.394
How did Diane end up
at a Black conference

05:51.438 --> 05:52.830
speaking for our firm?

05:52.874 --> 05:54.136
What an embarrassment.

05:54.179 --> 05:55.442
Take a look at this.

05:55.485 --> 05:56.878
Anonymous Crab
just posted a video.

05:56.921 --> 05:58.880
How do I play it?

05:58.923 --> 06:01.622
<i>So, how does that work, Diane,
you running a Black firm?</i>

06:01.665 --> 06:05.626
<i>Oh, well, I'm just a co-partner
-at, ooh, um, Reddick/
-Lockhart.</i>

06:05.669 --> 06:07.802
Uh-oh.
That's not good for Diane.

06:07.845 --> 06:10.500
<i>But isn't your husband involved
with the white supremacists</i>

06:10.544 --> 06:12.328
<i>who attacked the Capitol?</i>

06:12.372 --> 06:14.765
<i>No. He was completely cleared
of those charges.</i>

06:14.809 --> 06:18.116
<i>But didn't he just take a job
to revitalize the NRA?</i>

06:19.117 --> 06:20.336
<i>I...</i>

06:20.380 --> 06:22.425
<i>No. I believe that's an error.</i>

06:22.469 --> 06:24.514
Oh, God, I love technology.

06:24.558 --> 06:26.560
Okay.

06:26.603 --> 06:29.084
How are we doing
with the rich rapist?

06:29.127 --> 06:30.955
Sir, he's not a rapist.

06:30.999 --> 06:32.261
How's he doing?

06:32.304 --> 06:33.958
Preliminary hearing next week.

06:36.570 --> 06:38.180
<i>I heard she didn't even
have seniority.</i>

06:38.223 --> 06:40.269
She just jumped past
other Black partners

06:40.312 --> 06:42.053
to become our name partner.
It's crazy.

06:42.097 --> 06:43.141
<i>Diane doesn't give a shit</i>

06:43.185 --> 06:44.447
<i>about this firm's legacy.</i>

06:44.491 --> 06:46.318
<i>Diane is clueless.</i>

06:46.362 --> 06:48.408
<i>-And yet, somehow,
she's the one in charge?</i>

06:48.451 --> 06:50.322
<i>Liz needs
to do something about this.</i>

06:50.366 --> 06:52.150
<i>Liz will never do it
on her own.</i>

06:52.194 --> 06:54.283
<i>-We need to do something
ourselves.</i>

06:54.326 --> 06:56.372
<i>Some of us already are
doing something by speaking up.</i>

06:56.416 --> 06:58.330
<i>We just need
to keep it going.</i>

06:58.374 --> 07:01.246
-I know, look at Black Twitter,
it's exploding.

07:01.290 --> 07:03.074
What is Black Twitter?

07:03.118 --> 07:04.336
What?

07:04.380 --> 07:05.468
What is Black Twitter?

07:06.861 --> 07:09.646
People on Twitter who are Black
and talk to each other.

07:09.690 --> 07:11.779
-How do I get on it?
-Uh, well,

07:11.822 --> 07:15.347
I could tell you,
but then I'd have to kill you.

07:15.391 --> 07:16.958
It's not just Diane.
That's bad enough,

07:17.001 --> 07:19.395
but did you hear
who Julius Cain represented?

07:19.439 --> 07:21.005
<i>Oh, I know.</i>

07:21.049 --> 07:22.529
Fucking Trumpite.

07:22.572 --> 07:24.444
Why the hell is he
even working here?

07:24.487 --> 07:26.533
-I don't have any problem
with him working here.

07:26.576 --> 07:29.318
It's him representing
a white supremacist

07:29.361 --> 07:31.015
like Diane's husband.

07:31.059 --> 07:32.408
-What the fuck?

07:32.452 --> 07:35.019
I know.
Julius Cane is such a coon.

08:15.582 --> 08:16.974
Devin.

08:17.018 --> 08:18.410
You have a minute?

08:18.454 --> 08:20.848
Mr. Cain, hello. Yes.

08:22.545 --> 08:23.938
What do you need?

08:25.113 --> 08:28.986
Do you know who
Anonymous Platypus is on our,

08:29.030 --> 08:32.163
-uh, new office app?
-Do I? No.

08:32.207 --> 08:34.165
There-there won't be
any repercussions.

08:34.209 --> 08:36.820
I, uh, I just want to ask him
a few questions.

08:36.864 --> 08:38.518
The app gives us anonymous
animal names

08:38.561 --> 08:40.476
if users don't sign in.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.609
It allows more freedom and less
judgement when making comments.

08:42.652 --> 08:46.308
I understand, but there
has to be one Platypus, right?

08:46.351 --> 08:48.005
No. The computer switches
animals every day.

08:48.049 --> 08:49.877
So, today,
I'm Anonymous Chipmunk.

08:49.920 --> 08:52.401
The day before,
I was Anonymous Giraffe.

08:52.444 --> 08:55.056
-Is there something wrong?
-No, no, no. No, no. Uh...

08:55.099 --> 08:57.580
-Just, uh...

08:59.626 --> 09:01.410
Oh, my God.

09:01.453 --> 09:02.716
I-I didn't see that.

09:02.759 --> 09:05.327
I'm sorry, Mr. Cain.
This is not cool.

09:05.370 --> 09:07.372
Yeah, well, if you see them,
you let them know.

09:07.416 --> 09:08.678
Oh, I'll do more than that.

09:12.726 --> 09:14.858
That should end it, sir.

09:27.741 --> 09:30.526
-It's a sham court, Your Honor.
-Anything that he has to say,
this, no...

09:30.570 --> 09:33.224
-It pretends to judge
matters fairly...
-This is a meritless case.

09:33.268 --> 09:34.443
-...but the so-called judge...
-There was a contract...

09:34.486 --> 09:36.140
No, no, no, no, no.

09:36.184 --> 09:38.316
-I am not going to
shout over you...

09:38.360 --> 09:41.493
as my voice is not
at its best this morning.

09:41.537 --> 09:44.584
But what I will do,
if this continues,

09:44.627 --> 09:47.282
is hand out
my little contempt cards.

09:47.325 --> 09:49.240
The value goes up.

09:49.284 --> 09:52.243
It starts at $500, $1,000...

09:52.287 --> 09:53.636
$10,000.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.246
Wow, I really love that.

09:55.290 --> 09:57.597
Sir, let your lawyer speak.

09:57.640 --> 10:01.339
Mr. Schultz, didn't your clients
sign a mediation contract?

10:01.383 --> 10:02.863
He signed this, Your Honor.

10:02.906 --> 10:05.169
I'm not sure
I'd call it a contract.

10:05.213 --> 10:06.997
What is that?

10:07.041 --> 10:10.914
It's a contract written on the
back of a Chinese take-out menu.

10:10.958 --> 10:13.656
Your Honor, the contract could
have been chiseled on a rock.

10:13.700 --> 10:16.659
The terms are explicit
and signed by both parties.

10:16.703 --> 10:19.531
Certainly true, Mr. Schultz.

10:19.575 --> 10:21.316
Ridiculous, but true.

10:21.359 --> 10:24.493
Are, are you disputing that this
is your client's signature?

10:24.536 --> 10:27.496
No, but I...
We move to dismiss.

10:27.539 --> 10:30.934
Mr. Vitar is bound by the terms
of the arbitration agreement

10:30.978 --> 10:33.937
to honor
Judge Wackner's decision.

10:33.981 --> 10:35.765
-Judge Wackner?
-Sorry.

10:35.809 --> 10:36.940
No. Mr. Wackner.

10:38.681 --> 10:41.902
Uh-huh. Mr. Wackner,
do you purport to be a judge?

10:41.945 --> 10:44.644
I don't purport
to be anything. I am...

10:44.687 --> 10:47.211
I judge facts.
In that sense, I'm a judge.

10:47.255 --> 10:50.301
My client was told
he had to address Mr. Wackner

10:50.345 --> 10:51.694
as "Your Honor."

10:51.738 --> 10:53.261
"Your Honor" is a term
of endearment.

10:53.304 --> 10:57.134
Like the "Queen of Soul,"
or "Captain Crunch"

10:57.178 --> 10:58.788
or "Count Chocula."

10:58.832 --> 11:01.138
-And who are you?
-Uh, I'm Mr...

11:01.182 --> 11:03.184
Uh, I'm Judge...
Mr. Wackner's law clerk...

11:03.227 --> 11:05.229
Uh, okay.
Legally, it doesn't matter

11:05.273 --> 11:08.058
how Mr. Wackner was addressed
during arbitration.

11:08.102 --> 11:11.148
The point is that
Mr. Vitar himself

11:11.192 --> 11:13.716
gave him decision-making
authority when he signed...

11:13.760 --> 11:16.066
On the understanding
the man was sane.

11:16.110 --> 11:19.200
Your Honor,
Mr. Wackner is of unsound mind.

11:20.636 --> 11:21.898
Your Honor, he's joking.

11:21.942 --> 11:24.596
Mr. Wackner, if you lose,

11:24.640 --> 11:26.947
your court will be disbanded,

11:26.990 --> 11:29.601
and you will pay $800,000.

11:29.645 --> 11:31.429
You really think
this is the time to joke?

11:31.473 --> 11:33.867
We agree, Your Honor,

11:33.910 --> 11:37.261
and we ask that you dismiss
this case, based on its merits.

11:37.305 --> 11:39.916
Your Honor, at the very minimum,
you should hear evidence

11:39.960 --> 11:41.657
on Mr. Wackner's unsound mind.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.572
I agree.
I'll hear the evidence.

11:44.834 --> 11:46.096
It won't take very long.

11:48.882 --> 11:52.015
This was your first time
attempting to resolve a dispute

11:52.059 --> 11:53.930
-through Mr. Wackner,
is that correct?
-It is.

11:53.974 --> 11:56.498
Uh, I wouldn't have gone
anywhere near him

11:56.541 --> 11:58.326
-if I knew what a psycho ward
he was running...
-Objection.

11:58.369 --> 11:59.980
Sustained.

12:00.023 --> 12:02.286
What aspects of Mr. Wackner's
so-called court

12:02.330 --> 12:03.287
made you feel that way?

12:03.331 --> 12:04.941
Oh. Where to start?

12:04.985 --> 12:06.421
A scoreboard, um...

12:06.464 --> 12:09.685
Quizzing potential jurors
on state capitals?

12:09.729 --> 12:11.034
Oh, Christ.
-What, if any,

12:11.078 --> 12:13.341
specific instructions
were you given

12:13.384 --> 12:15.038
as to appropriate wardrobe?

12:15.082 --> 12:16.300
I was told to wear a moose suit.

12:16.344 --> 12:18.085
I'm sorry. What?

12:18.128 --> 12:20.000
I had to wear a moose suit.

12:20.043 --> 12:22.916
A moose suit.
What is a moose suit?

12:22.959 --> 12:25.788
It's a suit that looks
like a moose.

12:25.832 --> 12:27.790
It has a straw hat and a basket.

12:27.834 --> 12:30.924
Who told you
to wear a moose suit?

12:30.967 --> 12:32.839
Uh, the court officer.
He said it came from Wackner.

12:32.882 --> 12:34.188
Objection, hearsay.

12:34.231 --> 12:35.145
Your Honor,
because we're not relying

12:35.189 --> 12:37.191
solely on hearsay,

12:37.234 --> 12:39.410
-we'd like to introduce videos.
-Your Honor,

12:39.454 --> 12:41.978
we submitted
the official court transcripts.

12:42.022 --> 12:44.720
-This is the first we are
hearing about videos.
-That's odd.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.591
They were recorded by one
of Ms. Reddick's own clients.

12:46.635 --> 12:48.028
-Who?
-Del Cooper,

12:48.071 --> 12:49.681
for a streaming reality show.

12:56.645 --> 12:58.255
There she is.

12:58.299 --> 12:59.735
Hey.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.519
How we doing?

13:03.695 --> 13:04.827
Okay.

13:04.871 --> 13:06.394
How am I doing?

13:06.437 --> 13:08.744
When were you gonna tell me?

13:08.788 --> 13:11.878
What? That you, uh,
didn't like Cajun?

13:11.921 --> 13:15.751
No. The cameras
in Wackner's courtroom.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.058
You're doing a reality
show about my client?

13:18.101 --> 13:20.103
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

13:20.147 --> 13:21.713
<i>The People's Court
meets Mr. Wizard.</i>

13:21.757 --> 13:22.932
Amazing, right?

13:22.976 --> 13:24.629
But he's my client.

13:24.673 --> 13:26.762
You, you got him through me.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.503
Whoa, whoa, whoa, baby.
That--

13:28.546 --> 13:30.853
That makes it sound
like I was using you.

13:30.897 --> 13:33.421
I met him in your elevator.
That's all.

13:33.464 --> 13:35.031
You need some of this.

13:35.075 --> 13:36.685
N-No. No, no, no. You didn't...

13:36.728 --> 13:38.078
You didn't ask me.

13:38.121 --> 13:39.993
Liz...

13:40.036 --> 13:42.386
Why would I ask you?

13:43.910 --> 13:44.998
Well, because...

13:47.130 --> 13:49.350
Because they're using it
against me in court.

13:49.393 --> 13:50.742
That's unfortunate, baby.

13:50.786 --> 13:52.005
But-but this streaming show

13:52.048 --> 13:53.441
could be really good
for Wackner.

13:53.484 --> 13:55.922
It-It'll draw attention
to his court.

13:55.965 --> 13:57.749
And as I say that...

13:57.793 --> 13:59.403
that-that-that sounds...

13:59.447 --> 14:01.057
Okay, look. I'm Sorry.

14:01.101 --> 14:04.669
But look, if you ran into
the President of Lionsgate Films

14:04.713 --> 14:06.846
in my elevator,
I would say go for it, baby.

14:06.889 --> 14:10.023
In fact, use every
single contact in my book.

14:10.066 --> 14:11.372
Why?

14:11.415 --> 14:12.373
Because that's what
power couples do.

14:12.416 --> 14:14.331
Okay. I just, I...

14:14.375 --> 14:15.855
What?

14:15.898 --> 14:17.857
I just, I don't think
this is a good idea.

14:17.900 --> 14:19.902
Wackner becoming popular?

14:19.946 --> 14:21.338
Why?

14:21.382 --> 14:22.905
He's funny.

14:22.949 --> 14:24.515
He's a disrupter and...

14:24.559 --> 14:25.952
disrupters gotta disrupt.

14:25.995 --> 14:27.779
And look,
if I hadn't have done it,

14:27.823 --> 14:29.129
someone else would've.

14:29.172 --> 14:30.826
It's that kind of idea.

14:32.915 --> 14:34.612
Okay. I just...

14:34.656 --> 14:36.397
I don't think
it's gonna end well.

14:36.440 --> 14:39.008
Why not? Hmm?

14:39.052 --> 14:40.705
Comedy has its own logic.

14:40.749 --> 14:42.229
So just...

14:42.272 --> 14:43.708
Just breathe.

14:43.752 --> 14:45.232
Grab the wine.

14:45.275 --> 14:46.624
I made you some scrimps.

14:47.756 --> 14:49.497
Come on.

14:49.540 --> 14:51.455
You know,
I thought it was pretty sexy

14:51.499 --> 14:52.717
when you were mad at me earlier.

14:52.761 --> 14:54.284
-Oh...
-Yeah.

14:54.328 --> 14:55.938
Well, you just keep it up.

14:55.982 --> 14:57.897
I'm gonna be sexy
all the time.

14:57.940 --> 14:59.420
-Oh, and I'm gonna
make you mad all night.

15:08.516 --> 15:10.692
There must be something
we can do about this.

15:10.735 --> 15:12.302
Talk to the partners.

15:12.346 --> 15:14.087
Ask them how we could have
the white supremacist

15:14.130 --> 15:15.305
-running our firm.

15:15.349 --> 15:16.916
-They won't do shit.

15:16.959 --> 15:18.482
They can't be happy either.

15:18.526 --> 15:21.007
All they have to do
is vote Diane out.

15:22.008 --> 15:23.270
Hello?

15:25.881 --> 15:27.404
Are we getting drunk?

15:28.971 --> 15:30.233
What?

15:32.801 --> 15:34.150
Can I turn that down?

15:40.852 --> 15:43.029
I asked are we getting drunk?

15:46.902 --> 15:48.948
Are we getting a job
with the NRA?

15:51.820 --> 15:53.648
Did somebody call?

15:53.691 --> 15:55.171
No.

15:55.215 --> 15:57.913
I was at a conference
and someone asked.

15:59.828 --> 16:02.004
The NRA is trying
to revitalize itself

16:02.048 --> 16:03.875
after its recent scandals.

16:03.919 --> 16:06.313
Its National Board asked

16:06.356 --> 16:08.097
if I would be interested
in a position.

16:08.141 --> 16:09.838
And you said yes?

16:09.881 --> 16:12.710
No, I said
I want to hear more.

16:12.754 --> 16:14.538
And did you hear more?

16:14.582 --> 16:17.454
I heard it's a position
in Illinois,

16:17.498 --> 16:19.891
it offers $167,000,

16:19.935 --> 16:22.285
and I would be my own boss.

16:23.330 --> 16:24.766
So you're thinking
of taking it?

16:26.376 --> 16:29.684
I'm thinking I don't have a job,
and it's worth considering.

16:29.727 --> 16:30.990
The NR-fucking-A?

16:31.033 --> 16:33.340
The ACLU wasn't calling.

16:38.519 --> 16:39.955
Diane...

16:39.999 --> 16:41.391
our politics are very different.

16:41.435 --> 16:43.045
I know.

16:44.525 --> 16:46.005
I'm...

16:46.048 --> 16:49.182
lately, struck by
just how different they are.

16:49.225 --> 16:51.445
You want to convert me?

16:51.488 --> 16:54.752
No. I would just like one week
when I don't have to defend you.

16:54.796 --> 16:56.537
How are you defending me?

16:58.756 --> 17:00.367
Nothing.

17:00.410 --> 17:03.283
You'll tell me when
they offer you the job?

17:03.326 --> 17:05.807
They may not offer it.

17:06.808 --> 17:08.679
No, they will.

17:24.130 --> 17:25.435
Kurt.

17:26.958 --> 17:28.482
Mm.

17:31.441 --> 17:33.617
Kurt, I need to ask
you something.

17:36.533 --> 17:38.709
Are you awake?

17:42.757 --> 17:44.585
I am now.

17:44.628 --> 17:46.848
I need to ask you something.

17:47.892 --> 17:49.155
What?

17:52.071 --> 17:54.073
Who did you vote for in 2020?

17:55.552 --> 17:57.076
No, seriously.

17:58.381 --> 18:01.732
I know you wrote in Ted Cruz
in 2016,

18:01.776 --> 18:04.126
but who did you vote for
last year?

18:04.170 --> 18:05.649
Diane.

18:05.693 --> 18:07.825
We came through a lot this year.

18:07.869 --> 18:09.784
Can't we just let it rest?

18:11.394 --> 18:13.222
I don't know.

18:16.878 --> 18:19.010
I want to.

18:19.054 --> 18:20.577
Hmm.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.770
Hello.

18:45.950 --> 18:47.561
What do I do?

19:38.307 --> 19:40.048
-This is making me crazy.

19:41.876 --> 19:43.269
Can we just... can every...

19:43.312 --> 19:44.922
Can everyone just turn off
the Dawnk app.

19:44.966 --> 19:47.751
For... just for...
Please, just a minute.

19:48.796 --> 19:51.886
Okay. Is anybody else receiving
any offensive messages?

19:51.929 --> 19:53.714
The best thing we can do
is ignore it.

19:53.757 --> 19:56.020
It becomes a Streisand effect
if we complain.

19:56.064 --> 19:57.152
I didn't complain.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.501
I just want to speak with

19:58.545 --> 19:59.937
whoever's writing
the nasty things.

19:59.981 --> 20:01.765
I have to agree with Julius.

20:01.809 --> 20:03.245
If these youngbloods start
thinking they can speak

20:03.289 --> 20:04.899
to their superiors
any which way...

20:04.942 --> 20:06.857
But what's the option?
We can't censor them.

20:06.901 --> 20:07.989
You know,
this wouldn't be an issue,

20:08.032 --> 20:09.033
if not for Diane
and her husband.

20:09.077 --> 20:10.557
And I'm sorry to say it, Julius,

20:10.600 --> 20:12.863
but you should never have
agreed to take that case.

20:12.907 --> 20:14.474
It was Diane's case. Hello?

20:14.517 --> 20:16.171
She defended me.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.739
But not that client.
Diane should've known better.

20:18.782 --> 20:21.002
Come on. Diane is not
responsible for her husband.

20:21.045 --> 20:22.482
No. No. That-that's unfair.

20:22.525 --> 20:24.832
Listen, we all live
in the real world, right?

20:24.875 --> 20:26.486
I mean,
you are who you associate with.

20:26.529 --> 20:28.531
And in the real world
of this firm,

20:28.575 --> 20:31.491
Diane's billable hours
speak for themselves.

20:31.534 --> 20:33.232
The rest of us put in
the hours too, for the record.

20:33.275 --> 20:36.278
And none of us have spouses
on the hook to the FBI.

20:36.322 --> 20:37.975
-The case has been dropped.
Nice work.

20:38.019 --> 20:40.282
Liz, when I joined this firm,

20:40.326 --> 20:41.849
it was because of
your father's legacy.

20:41.892 --> 20:46.288
It was about Black civil rights,
activism, justice.

20:46.332 --> 20:49.987
That's what people
talked about in meetings.

20:50.031 --> 20:52.251
Now, people talk about
billable hours,

20:52.294 --> 20:54.209
million-dollar clients,

20:54.253 --> 20:56.342
-corporate payouts. Now, I...
-Okay.

20:56.385 --> 20:58.300
I know it's not your fault.

20:58.344 --> 20:59.867
That was Boseman's vision,

20:59.910 --> 21:02.304
and we were trying
to survive the Trump years

21:02.348 --> 21:04.480
by bringing in white lawyers.

21:04.524 --> 21:06.700
But those days are gone.

21:06.743 --> 21:08.267
They're done with.

21:08.310 --> 21:11.313
And I miss being
a strong Black firm.

21:11.357 --> 21:12.967
Amen.

21:13.010 --> 21:15.143
Did I miss something
about a partners' meeting?

21:15.186 --> 21:16.927
Uh, no, no. This was impromptu.

21:18.538 --> 21:20.148
Well if I can be
of any assistance...

21:20.191 --> 21:22.803
Yeah, I'll-I'll-I'll bring you
up to speed later.

21:26.372 --> 21:29.679
-You got to handle this, Liz.
-Handle what?

21:29.723 --> 21:33.988
You cannot have a white partner
leading a Black firm.

21:34.031 --> 21:36.295
We'll lose clients

21:36.338 --> 21:38.340
with that kind of hypocrisy.

21:45.739 --> 21:47.567
Is this the beginning
of the end?

21:47.610 --> 21:49.133
I don't want to be
in the bathroom

21:49.177 --> 21:50.352
and accidentally miss anything.

21:50.396 --> 21:51.745
What are you talking about?

21:51.788 --> 21:53.573
The meeting in Liz's office.

21:53.616 --> 21:55.009
You're not in it.

21:57.228 --> 21:59.361
Forget it.

21:59.405 --> 22:01.102
I was joking.

22:11.765 --> 22:13.767
<i>Liz Reddick's office.</i>

22:13.810 --> 22:16.073
Hi. Can I get time with Liz
later on today?

22:16.117 --> 22:17.597
<i>Who's calling?</i>

22:19.033 --> 22:20.991
It's Diane.

24:04.747 --> 24:06.749
Here.

24:08.490 --> 24:09.970
Who thought that sound
was pleasing?

24:10.013 --> 24:12.189
All day in court today.

24:12.233 --> 24:13.626
-No.
-Yeah.

24:13.669 --> 24:15.671
I finally had to ask Carmen

24:15.715 --> 24:18.326
how to silence
the notifications.

24:18.369 --> 24:20.023
All right. There you go.

24:20.067 --> 24:21.764
Permanently silenced.

24:23.549 --> 24:25.333
Can I have a soda water?

24:25.376 --> 24:27.030
Thank you.

24:27.074 --> 24:30.294
Do you think that Dawnk
actually increases productivity?

24:30.338 --> 24:32.427
No.

24:32.471 --> 24:34.951
But I know that the associates
would riot

24:34.995 --> 24:36.953
if we got rid of it. So...

24:36.997 --> 24:38.520
What do the partners think?

24:38.564 --> 24:40.435
God, Madeline
can't even open it.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.829
She's...

24:42.872 --> 24:44.395
She's lost her password
three times.

24:44.439 --> 24:45.527
-She finally just gave up.

24:45.571 --> 24:46.746
You know, 'cause it's Madeline.

24:47.747 --> 24:48.878
Well...

24:50.793 --> 24:52.969
Thanks for sitting
down with me, Liz.

24:53.013 --> 24:54.667
Of course.

24:56.407 --> 24:58.497
So, you're wondering
about the meeting today?

24:58.540 --> 25:00.499
-I am.
-Yeah.

25:00.542 --> 25:02.326
Uh, it was about Julius.

25:02.370 --> 25:04.241
He's being harassed on Dawnk.

25:05.852 --> 25:08.550
Okay, and I couldn't be
a part of that?

25:08.594 --> 25:12.032
He's being harassed because
he's defending your husband.

25:15.601 --> 25:17.516
Well, that's unfortunate.

25:17.559 --> 25:20.954
We've represented people
far worse than Kurt,

25:20.997 --> 25:22.956
who, by the way,
was found innocent.

25:22.999 --> 25:24.653
I'm not saying that he wasn't.

25:24.697 --> 25:26.220
But...

25:26.263 --> 25:28.091
January 6.

25:28.135 --> 25:30.833
I mean,
we watched the Confederate flag

25:30.877 --> 25:32.966
make its way
into the Capitol building.

25:34.794 --> 25:36.796
You know, those people that

25:36.839 --> 25:38.928
Kurt didn't want
to turn over to the FBI,

25:38.972 --> 25:40.582
those people...

25:40.626 --> 25:43.454
They don't even want us alive.

25:43.498 --> 25:45.544
Well, not all of them.

25:47.328 --> 25:49.635
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that. I...

25:49.678 --> 25:52.333
certainly not defending
those people.

25:52.376 --> 25:54.378
They're all despicable traitors.

25:54.422 --> 25:57.251
And now, that's what people
are saying about Julius.

25:59.775 --> 26:01.124
And me?

26:06.129 --> 26:07.478
Diane, I...

26:07.522 --> 26:09.785
-Am I being pushed out?
-No.

26:09.829 --> 26:11.308
Not pushed out.

26:11.352 --> 26:13.180
You're a name partner.
You can't be pushed out.

26:13.223 --> 26:14.616
But...?

26:17.314 --> 26:21.623
The partners just think you
should do the right thing.

26:27.803 --> 26:29.283
And step aside?

26:31.590 --> 26:33.766
No. Stay in the firm.

26:33.809 --> 26:36.682
Stay as an equity partner,

26:36.725 --> 26:39.598
just step back
from your managerial role.

26:48.258 --> 26:50.957
Liz, I-- I pull in
the big clients.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.785
I...

26:52.828 --> 26:54.656
I get the billable hours.

26:54.700 --> 26:56.832
But still,
"maybe you should step aside."

26:59.008 --> 27:01.663
Weren't we going to form a firm

27:01.707 --> 27:03.665
led by women?

27:05.580 --> 27:07.669
And I...

27:07.713 --> 27:09.497
hope that it will be.

27:09.540 --> 27:10.585
But Black women?

27:12.718 --> 27:14.894
Diane, I...

27:14.937 --> 27:17.113
I am not voting against you.

27:17.157 --> 27:19.115
I promised you that I wouldn't.

27:19.159 --> 27:22.075
But there is growing anger here.

27:23.119 --> 27:25.818
They want to address it
at the next partners' meeting.

27:27.036 --> 27:29.082
So just think about it.

27:30.387 --> 27:32.041
You're a good person.

27:41.529 --> 27:43.618
No, I'm not.

27:45.968 --> 27:48.014
Yes, you are.

27:57.719 --> 27:59.373
What do you want to do?

27:59.416 --> 28:01.244
What do <i>I</i> want to do?

28:02.811 --> 28:05.031
I want to keep my name
on the letterhead.

28:06.336 --> 28:09.122
I want to keep
what I fought for.

28:09.165 --> 28:11.733
Against gender
and then age discrimination.

28:11.777 --> 28:13.256
I deserve that position.

28:13.300 --> 28:15.694
And I don't want to step aside.

28:15.737 --> 28:16.782
Then don't.

28:18.305 --> 28:20.742
Diane, this is the first time

28:20.786 --> 28:22.701
I've ever heard you
sound defeated.

28:26.400 --> 28:27.749
Because I can't win this.

28:27.793 --> 28:29.359
-Sure you can.
-No, I can't.

28:29.403 --> 28:30.447
You just don't want to.

28:30.491 --> 28:32.754
It's bigger than that.

28:32.798 --> 28:36.889
To fight this would go against
every fiber of my being.

28:36.932 --> 28:38.847
Every fiber in your being
is about winning.

28:38.891 --> 28:40.414
If you don't try to win,

28:40.457 --> 28:42.111
then you might as well
give up on everything.

28:42.155 --> 28:43.939
Kurt, I appreciate
the pep talk,

28:43.983 --> 28:45.724
but I don't think
the way you think.

28:45.767 --> 28:50.206
I cannot put my interests
above a whole group of people--

28:50.250 --> 28:52.208
Black people--

28:52.252 --> 28:54.689
just so I can keep my position.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.735
No, I'm saying you are talented.

28:56.778 --> 28:59.215
If someone is gonna beat you,
let them beat you,

28:59.259 --> 29:01.783
but with talent.

29:01.827 --> 29:03.785
But a Black person's talent

29:03.829 --> 29:06.353
has always been valued
less than mine.

29:09.182 --> 29:10.270
Then you're right.

29:10.313 --> 29:11.575
Give up.

29:11.619 --> 29:13.099
Leave the firm.

29:13.142 --> 29:14.753
They don't want you.

29:30.072 --> 29:31.944
Kurt...

29:36.470 --> 29:38.907
You don't think
the election was stolen, do you?

29:41.997 --> 29:44.086
Kurt?

30:21.471 --> 30:22.864
Well?

30:24.083 --> 30:25.780
What do you think?

30:25.824 --> 30:27.738
About your work?

30:27.782 --> 30:29.697
Yeah, shh. He's sleeping.

30:29.740 --> 30:31.264
Yes.

30:31.307 --> 30:33.962
I think you know what I think.

30:34.963 --> 30:37.836
No, I-I don't think I do.

30:37.879 --> 30:39.533
I think you're brilliant.

30:39.576 --> 30:43.842
I think any law firm
would be insane to let you go.

30:45.365 --> 30:47.062
That's not you.

30:47.106 --> 30:49.108
That's you telling me
what I want to hear.

30:51.719 --> 30:53.939
You want to know
what I really think?

30:53.982 --> 30:55.984
I do. Tell me.

30:56.028 --> 30:59.988
All my life,
I was told to step aside.

31:00.032 --> 31:03.339
I was in law school.
I had a baby.

31:03.383 --> 31:05.385
And I was told
I should step aside,

31:05.428 --> 31:07.953
so that a man could take
my position.

31:07.996 --> 31:10.259
I was told to step aside

31:10.303 --> 31:13.872
when Jimmy Carter appointed me
to the Court of Appeals.

31:13.915 --> 31:16.744
And the same
with the Supreme Court.

31:18.267 --> 31:20.008
Here's the thing...

31:20.052 --> 31:23.577
Don't step aside because
someone wants you to.

31:23.620 --> 31:26.449
Don't step aside for politics.

31:26.493 --> 31:29.583
Men are always asking women
to step aside

31:29.626 --> 31:31.237
so a man can go first.

31:32.281 --> 31:35.371
Even though I'm being asked
to step aside

31:35.415 --> 31:38.287
so that a Black person
can take my place?

31:38.331 --> 31:41.725
Can you still do something
for women?

31:42.988 --> 31:44.598
Yes.

31:44.641 --> 31:46.948
Then... then do it.

31:46.992 --> 31:49.211
Don't step aside.

31:49.255 --> 31:51.997
Whatever it takes,
don't step aside.

32:11.625 --> 32:13.409
So how's business?

32:13.453 --> 32:15.020
You tell me.

32:15.063 --> 32:17.587
Well, no more lawsuits.

32:17.631 --> 32:19.589
And you had your best year
this year.

32:19.633 --> 32:21.069
Yeah, who knew?

32:21.113 --> 32:23.463
Pandemic years
are great for fracking.

32:23.506 --> 32:27.206
And being in this firm helps
with Democratic influencers.

32:27.249 --> 32:29.599
Yeah, I see that.

32:29.643 --> 32:31.906
So, Bob, I asked you here today

32:31.950 --> 32:34.953
because the firm is undergoing
a fairly major change.

32:34.996 --> 32:38.826
I'm stepping down as a partner,

32:38.869 --> 32:41.829
so I won't be meeting with you
day-to-day on your cases.

32:41.872 --> 32:43.352
-What?
-Yes.

32:43.396 --> 32:47.052
I'm sorry. Madeline will
be handling your cases.

32:47.095 --> 32:49.271
She's standing right over there.

32:50.272 --> 32:51.621
Wait.

32:51.665 --> 32:53.188
I don't get this. Who is she?

32:53.232 --> 32:55.408
Uh, she's a partner.

32:55.451 --> 32:57.671
She's very good.

32:57.714 --> 33:00.935
I'll-I'll still be
handling your cases.

33:00.979 --> 33:03.242
I just won't have
daily contact with you.

33:03.285 --> 33:05.244
But I'm more comfortable
with you.

33:05.287 --> 33:07.246
I don't won't to start over
with someone new.

33:07.289 --> 33:10.031
I can make you more comfortable
with Madeline.

33:12.077 --> 33:13.687
But we're comfortable with you.

33:13.730 --> 33:15.819
I can make you comfortable
with Julius.

33:15.863 --> 33:17.952
He's a very competent lawyer.

33:17.996 --> 33:20.607
-Are you retiring?
-No.

33:20.650 --> 33:23.958
The firm just wants to let
some other people step forward

33:24.002 --> 33:26.221
into a name partner position.

33:29.094 --> 33:30.704
We don't like this.

33:30.747 --> 33:31.922
All right?
We're comfortable with you.

33:31.966 --> 33:34.099
So, who should we call about it?

33:36.231 --> 33:38.233
<i>...analysts using data-driven

33:43.108 --> 33:45.023

33:51.333 --> 33:52.943
No, who told you that?

33:52.987 --> 33:54.641
You're not gonna lose Diane.

33:54.684 --> 33:56.382
She's still your primary.

Okay. Okay.

33:59.385 --> 34:01.169
Let me get into this.

34:01.213 --> 34:04.085
No. No, I'll call you.

Actually...

34:55.223 --> 34:57.007
you know, why don't we do this?

34:57.051 --> 34:58.444
Your Honor...

34:58.487 --> 35:00.010
Yes.
-Yes.

35:00.054 --> 35:01.838
Uh, instead of me asking
the questions,

35:01.882 --> 35:05.059
I'm sure you have
questions of your own.

35:07.627 --> 35:10.673
Sir, what possible excuse
do you have

35:10.717 --> 35:13.241
for keeping score at trial?

35:13.285 --> 35:14.938
The scoreboard keeps
the lawyers on their toes.

35:16.505 --> 35:18.159
I don't want anyone to lose
simply because

35:18.203 --> 35:20.161
they didn't know where I stood.

35:20.205 --> 35:22.120
And it seems a good idea
that they have a roadmap

35:22.163 --> 35:23.338
to my thinking.

35:23.382 --> 35:24.818
-Keeps me honest.
-Okay, and...

35:24.861 --> 35:27.342
what the hell is
this thing about Scmuley?

35:27.386 --> 35:28.517
Oh. You didn't say it correctly.

35:28.561 --> 35:30.040
-It's Shmuley.
-Ah.

35:30.084 --> 35:32.652
Shmuley's Hebrew.
It means, "His Name is God."

35:32.695 --> 35:34.523
It's also the name of my uncle.

35:34.567 --> 35:38.179
He died that day,
with a smile on his face.

35:39.180 --> 35:41.182
And I loved him, and, uh...

35:41.226 --> 35:44.316
-I wanted to honor him.
-Okay, nice.

35:44.359 --> 35:46.492
And the moose and
the buffalo suits,

35:46.535 --> 35:47.971
what's that about?

35:48.015 --> 35:49.886
-Do you watch <i>The Masked Singer?
-No.</i>

35:49.930 --> 35:52.846
Well, yes. Uh, once.

35:52.889 --> 35:55.501
Well, I like to think
of myself as unbiased,

35:55.544 --> 35:57.198
but I'm not.

35:57.242 --> 36:00.723
I judge based on race,
gender, class, age.

36:00.767 --> 36:03.161
I like to think I don't,
but I do.

36:03.204 --> 36:07.426
And when the plaintiff
and defense are in disguises,

36:07.469 --> 36:08.731
I can't.

36:08.775 --> 36:10.907
I can't see who they are.

36:10.951 --> 36:12.474
Why not put them
behind a screen?

36:12.518 --> 36:14.128
Well, it's good
for the litigants. Um...

36:14.172 --> 36:16.217
It's hard to have
a sense of entitlement

36:16.261 --> 36:17.218
when you're dressed as a moose.

36:18.828 --> 36:21.135
Okay. I'm ready to rule.

36:21.179 --> 36:22.615
-Your Honor, wait...
-No. No.

36:22.658 --> 36:25.487
Mr. Schultz, uh,
you have done an excellent job

36:25.531 --> 36:28.577
conveying what it's like to be a
litigant in Mr. Wackner's court,

36:28.621 --> 36:31.928
but much of what he does
is challenge convention,

36:31.972 --> 36:34.279
and in doing so,
streamlines the process.

36:34.322 --> 36:35.758
And for that, I give him credit.

36:35.802 --> 36:38.283
What is before this court

36:38.326 --> 36:41.503
is whether the parties will
be bound by his rulings.

36:41.547 --> 36:45.464
Given that they agreed
to be so bound,

36:45.507 --> 36:47.727
I don't think that
the plaintiff's evidence is...

36:47.770 --> 36:50.251
-Your Honor,
one quick amendment.
-Quick.

36:50.295 --> 36:52.297
-Your Honor, you,
you have already ruled.
-I want to hear.

36:52.340 --> 36:54.647
You determined that
Mr. Wackner is sound,

36:54.690 --> 36:56.692
but that doesn't mean
he's unbiased.

36:56.736 --> 36:59.521
He's already testified
that he is a biased mediator.

36:59.565 --> 37:01.784
-Oh, come on.
-He said it himself.

37:01.828 --> 37:03.482
Um...

37:03.525 --> 37:06.006
"I like to think of myself
as unbiased, but I'm not."

37:06.049 --> 37:08.008
-That's a direct quote.
He said he battles

37:08.051 --> 37:09.792
his bias with these costumes.

37:09.836 --> 37:11.838
Yes, but we have
other proof of his bias.

37:11.881 --> 37:15.363
And I would ask the court for
an opportunity to demonstrate.

37:15.407 --> 37:17.017
Again, Your Honor,

37:17.060 --> 37:18.366
you have already ruled.

37:18.410 --> 37:19.715
-Your Honor, wait.
-Wait. Wait. Wait.

37:19.759 --> 37:22.109
I-- I will withhold judgement

37:22.152 --> 37:24.938
until you can present
more evidence, Counselor.

37:24.981 --> 37:27.027
You're in a tough spot, Judge.

37:27.070 --> 37:29.421
-I would have done
the exact same thing.
-Mr. Wackner...

37:29.464 --> 37:32.772
I think it would be a good idea
for you to shut up.

37:39.126 --> 37:41.389
♪ <i>Yeah, we brewin' like Medici,
a little freaky♪</i>

37:41.433 --> 37:43.609
♪ <i>Lemme look, lemme look
I wanna see, see♪</i>

37:43.652 --> 37:46.176

37:46.220 --> 37:47.395

37:47.439 --> 37:48.875
Okay.

37:48.918 --> 37:50.877
Is this the only record
of Trina's dance?

37:50.920 --> 37:52.574
As far as I know, yes.

37:52.618 --> 37:54.141
To your knowledge, she
never wrote it down anywhere?

37:54.184 --> 37:56.143
Objection. Relevance.
What does it matter

37:56.186 --> 37:58.319
-whether she wrote it
down or not?
-Copyright law requires

37:58.363 --> 38:00.278
that creative expression
be fixed

38:00.321 --> 38:01.757
before it can be licensed.

38:01.801 --> 38:03.063
Yes, but fixed doesn't mean
written down.

38:03.106 --> 38:04.151
It just means recorded.

38:04.194 --> 38:05.500
And she's obviously done that,

38:05.544 --> 38:07.067
because we're all here
looking at it.

38:07.110 --> 38:08.460
May I continue?

38:08.503 --> 38:09.722
I don't know.

38:09.765 --> 38:11.419
This is all confusing to me.

38:11.463 --> 38:13.247
Let me try to clarify,
Your Honor.

38:13.291 --> 38:15.815
This tape we just watched,
who recorded it?

38:15.858 --> 38:17.338
Did Trina record it?

38:17.382 --> 38:18.339
Well, no, but her boyfriend did.

38:18.383 --> 38:20.123
So isn't it true

38:20.167 --> 38:22.387
the person who fixed
the creative expression

38:22.430 --> 38:24.476
is the owner of the copyright?

38:24.519 --> 38:26.391
Objection. Beyond his expertise.

38:26.434 --> 38:28.654
Oh, uh,
I'll, I'll grant you that.

38:28.697 --> 38:30.308
And the question doesn't need
to be asked. That's true.

38:30.351 --> 38:32.962
So the owner of the copyright
is not the dancer.

38:33.006 --> 38:35.095
She didn't
write her choreography down.

38:35.138 --> 38:37.097
It's the person
who held the camera

38:37.140 --> 38:38.664
and recorded the choreography?

38:38.707 --> 38:42.015
Yes, which is why I paid
Russell Chuckwagon $40,000

38:42.058 --> 38:43.886
to insure this copyright.

38:43.930 --> 38:45.366
Who's Russell Chuckwagon?

38:45.410 --> 38:48.413
Tip-top Trina's
estranged boyfriend.

38:48.456 --> 38:49.979
So you just ignored
the boyfriend?

38:50.023 --> 38:51.372
Of course I ignored
the boyfriend.

38:51.416 --> 38:53.592
-Mr. Chuckwagon?
-Yes.

38:53.635 --> 38:55.985
The only reason
that video has any value

38:56.029 --> 38:57.683
is because of Trina's dance.

38:57.726 --> 39:01.600
The notion that he deserves
any consideration

39:01.643 --> 39:03.645
just because he happened
to be holding the camera...

39:03.689 --> 39:05.604
It-it makes the law an ass.

39:05.647 --> 39:09.390
As you can see, Mr. Wackner has
completely disregarded the law.

39:09.434 --> 39:12.567
Arbitrators are under no
obligation to follow the law

39:12.611 --> 39:14.395
unless the contract
stipulates to that,

39:14.439 --> 39:16.397
which it doesn't, in this case.

39:16.441 --> 39:20.053
More-Moreover,
Mr. Schultz's line of argument

39:20.096 --> 39:23.665
relies on laws with
disturbing racial implications.

39:23.709 --> 39:27.800
By requiring that art be
recorded before being owned,

39:27.843 --> 39:31.412
the law systematically
disadvantages Black jazz

39:31.456 --> 39:34.720
and bebop musicians,
as well as break dancers

39:34.763 --> 39:36.417
and flamenco artists...

39:36.461 --> 39:40.290
There are a whole slew
of gifted,

39:40.334 --> 39:42.423
often non-white people

39:42.467 --> 39:44.904
who specialize
in improvisational art.

39:44.947 --> 39:47.733
Do you... do you really
want to suggest

39:47.776 --> 39:49.778
that whoever's holding a phone
next to them

39:49.822 --> 39:52.868
is the one that owns the art
that they created?

39:58.439 --> 39:59.919
Sit down, Mr. Wackner.

39:59.962 --> 40:02.661
Defense counsel is saying
that she agrees with him?

40:02.704 --> 40:05.272
-That the law is an ass?
-I...

40:05.315 --> 40:07.230
In this particular case,
yes, I guess I do.

40:07.274 --> 40:08.928
We need to stop worshipping

40:08.971 --> 40:11.757
at the heels of legal weasels
and corporate pirates.

40:11.800 --> 40:13.846
Do I need to say more,
Your Honor?

40:13.889 --> 40:15.456
The defense revels
in disregarding

40:15.500 --> 40:17.980
a central tenet
of copyright law.

40:21.114 --> 40:22.855
In this case, the court agrees.

40:22.898 --> 40:24.465
The law is an ass.

40:24.509 --> 40:25.640
Hey.

40:25.684 --> 40:27.250
Don't make me regret this.

40:27.294 --> 40:31.429
Mr. Wackner is well within
his rights to ignore

40:31.472 --> 40:36.172
Mr. Chuckwagon's massive
contribution to the arts.

40:36.216 --> 40:37.304
Ms. Reddick, I'm ready to rule.

40:37.347 --> 40:38.914
Your Honor,

40:38.958 --> 40:39.959
-we have one more witness.
Oh, my God,

40:40.002 --> 40:41.351
it's like a zombie.

40:41.395 --> 40:43.266
I think you can step down
now, Mr. Wackner.

40:43.310 --> 40:46.182
We've heard
enough metaphors from you today.

40:48.881 --> 40:50.404
Who is the new witness,

40:50.448 --> 40:52.580
-Mr. Schultz?
-His name is Del Cooper.

40:56.541 --> 41:00.675
Mr. Cooper, you missed quite
a passionate little speech

41:00.719 --> 41:03.286
-by the defendant
about corporate pirates.
-I did?

41:03.330 --> 41:04.897
Objection.
-Sustained.

41:04.940 --> 41:06.202
Mr. Schultz, why don't you
just get to the point?

41:06.246 --> 41:08.030
Gladly.

41:08.074 --> 41:11.643
Who is the financial backer
for Wackner's so-called court?

41:12.644 --> 41:14.384
What do you mean?

41:14.428 --> 41:16.343
Mr. Wackner's court has become
more and more expensive

41:16.386 --> 41:17.736
over the last month.

41:17.779 --> 41:19.781
-Who's footing the bill?
-Objection.

41:19.825 --> 41:21.522
You're Honor, I-I'm not sure
why this is being asked

41:21.566 --> 41:23.045
of a mere TV producer.

41:23.089 --> 41:25.134
I'm asking because
this "mere TV producer"

41:25.178 --> 41:27.746
has inside information
about the court's financing.

41:27.789 --> 41:29.530
Why does this
really matter at all?

41:29.574 --> 41:30.792
Because of bias, Your Honor.

41:30.836 --> 41:32.098
I think the answer
to my question

41:32.141 --> 41:33.099
will be self-explanatory.

41:33.142 --> 41:34.317
Okay.

41:34.361 --> 41:35.971
Go ahead.

41:36.015 --> 41:37.495
Do you know
who is financing this court?

41:37.538 --> 41:38.713
I do.

41:38.757 --> 41:39.932
Who?

41:39.975 --> 41:41.237
David Cord.

41:41.281 --> 41:42.935
David Cord?

41:42.978 --> 41:45.154
David Cord the billion...

41:45.198 --> 41:46.982
Yes, the billionaire financier.

41:47.026 --> 41:49.028
That gentleman right there.

41:49.071 --> 41:50.856
Why do you think he's here?

41:50.899 --> 41:54.424
He's financing a video game
company in direct competition.

41:54.468 --> 41:55.861
Uh, uh, objection, Your Honor.

41:55.904 --> 41:57.558
The-the counselor is testifying.

41:57.602 --> 41:58.864
Oh, no, no. Come on. Come on.
Just hold on a minute.

41:58.907 --> 42:00.692
Mr. Schultz,
finish your thought.

42:00.735 --> 42:02.041
Mr. Cord invests in Riga,

42:02.084 --> 42:04.260
my client's
biggest gaming rival,

42:04.304 --> 42:07.046
while also investing
in Mr. Wackner's court.

42:07.089 --> 42:09.091
A short time later,

42:09.135 --> 42:11.006
Mr. Wackner
rules against my client.

42:13.618 --> 42:16.011
Did you not think
it was worth mentioning

42:16.055 --> 42:18.231
that you'd invested
in competing game manufacturers?

42:18.274 --> 42:20.276
I invest in everything.

42:20.320 --> 42:22.496
I've got 10% of this,
20% of that.

42:22.540 --> 42:24.716
Actually, I had no idea
I was invested

42:24.759 --> 42:26.065
in a video game company.

42:26.108 --> 42:27.632
Then I propose
we seize the moment.

42:27.675 --> 42:29.590
-What does that mean?
-We march back in there,

42:29.634 --> 42:31.940
-and I bowl them over
with the truth.
-Oh, my God.

42:31.984 --> 42:33.768
History's been made
by great rhetorical flourishes.

42:33.812 --> 42:35.335
Well, not really.

42:35.378 --> 42:36.771
"We shall fight them
on the beaches."

42:36.815 --> 42:38.468
"We few, we happy few..."

42:38.512 --> 42:40.470
Mr. Cord, their next move
is going to be

42:40.514 --> 42:42.516
to subpoena
your financial records.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.649
They're gonna want
to put you on the stand.

42:44.692 --> 42:45.954
I don't think you want
to go down that road.

42:45.998 --> 42:47.477
-You're right.
-All right.

42:47.521 --> 42:49.392
Now, let's... let's ask
for a continuance.

42:49.436 --> 42:52.308
All right? We'll be unopposed
from the other side.

42:52.352 --> 42:53.440
They-- they're in no hurry
to force this issue.

42:53.483 --> 42:54.963
A continuance till when?

42:55.007 --> 42:56.617
Well, the judge has
a busy calendar.

42:56.661 --> 42:58.010
So, I don't know,
about ten months.

42:58.053 --> 42:59.925
Holy fucking hell.
That's the problem.

42:59.968 --> 43:02.231
No one's in a hurry.
We delay and delay and delay.

43:02.275 --> 43:04.494
One day,
we look back on our lives,

43:04.538 --> 43:06.105
wonder where the fuck they went.

43:06.148 --> 43:07.672
-People die while we wait.
Hal.

43:07.715 --> 43:09.717
This allows you
to keep your court open.

43:09.761 --> 43:11.632
It gives you the whole year
to work out the kinks

43:11.676 --> 43:12.633
and get it on TV.

43:12.677 --> 43:14.200
What does it matter

43:14.243 --> 43:16.724
if people do not have
to follow my judgements?

43:16.768 --> 43:18.552
I say six million

43:18.596 --> 43:20.423
and they just
go whining to Big Boy court.

43:20.467 --> 43:22.556
It's appeal, appeal, appeal.
It never fucking ends.

43:26.125 --> 43:27.692
Oh, God.

43:32.827 --> 43:34.394
Do you know what this is about?

43:34.437 --> 43:35.569
No idea.

43:47.233 --> 43:48.756
What the fuck is going on?

43:51.019 --> 43:52.760
Could you be
a bit more specific?

43:53.761 --> 43:55.633
My bosses in Dubai,

43:55.676 --> 43:58.853
they don't think in terms
of millions or even billions.

43:58.897 --> 44:01.551
They think in
terms of trillions of dollars.

44:01.595 --> 44:03.858
They look at their computer's
algorithms and only react

44:03.902 --> 44:05.164
when it blinks red.

44:05.207 --> 44:07.732
And you two,
you're blinking red.

44:07.775 --> 44:11.083
-Why?
-Four of your top clients
have called with issues.

44:11.126 --> 44:12.954
What issues?

44:12.998 --> 44:16.610
The teamsters, they're being
shifted to another partner.

44:16.654 --> 44:20.353
Bob the fracking king,
he's being shifted, too.

44:20.396 --> 44:22.050
Who told them
about a reorganization?

44:24.574 --> 44:25.880
Diane.

44:25.924 --> 44:28.274
-Thoughts?
-Nothing from me.

44:28.317 --> 44:29.928
I met with my clients.

44:29.971 --> 44:31.843
I just told them
of a restructuring

44:31.886 --> 44:33.845
that I was being told about.

44:33.888 --> 44:35.716
What restructuring?

44:35.760 --> 44:38.371
Wait. Wait, David. Stop.

44:38.414 --> 44:41.200
Is this a power play
on your part?

44:41.243 --> 44:43.158
No. It's just updating
my clients.

44:45.421 --> 44:49.251
David, Diane was told
about frustration

44:49.295 --> 44:52.254
at the partner level
about a white woman

44:52.298 --> 44:54.256
being a name partner
in a Black firm.

44:54.300 --> 44:56.389
And apparently,
this is her response.

44:56.432 --> 44:58.130
I just told our clients
what was going on.

44:58.173 --> 44:59.566
Stop.

44:59.609 --> 45:01.220
Both of you.

45:01.263 --> 45:03.875
Diane's a fucking name partner

45:03.918 --> 45:06.834
until STR Laurie says she's not.

45:08.053 --> 45:10.882
No one decides until I decide.

45:10.925 --> 45:14.276
Now, stick your race war
back in its bottle.

45:22.023 --> 45:23.633
Diane.

45:23.677 --> 45:25.592
That was a mistake.

45:25.635 --> 45:28.334
I am on your side,
and you don't even realize it.

45:47.483 --> 45:49.355
You see what they're writing
about me?

45:49.398 --> 45:51.183
Yes.

45:51.226 --> 45:53.489
I want to start my own firm.

45:53.533 --> 45:56.144
And I want you to be
the other name partner.

46:15.511 --> 46:17.209
Who is it?

46:18.340 --> 46:20.081
Who is it?

46:21.822 --> 46:23.519
Who the hell are you?

46:23.563 --> 46:24.999
Don't worry who we are.

46:25.043 --> 46:26.348
-Worry who you are.
-What does that mean?

46:26.392 --> 46:27.654
I have people...

46:27.697 --> 46:30.135
<i>-No!</i>

46:32.877 --> 46:35.314
Your Honor, I would like
to offer my profound apology

46:35.357 --> 46:37.142
for my behavior in this court.

46:37.185 --> 46:40.928
Baring my buttocks was an
unforgivable act of disrespect,

46:40.972 --> 46:43.670
one that I will regret
to the end of my days.

46:43.713 --> 46:47.761
I-I have here
a letter of, uh, apology

46:47.805 --> 46:50.720
and a check made out for a lot

46:50.764 --> 46:53.158
to Tip-top Trina
for the amount that she is owed,

46:53.201 --> 46:55.116
according to your wise decision.

46:55.160 --> 46:57.379
I don't know what to say.

46:57.423 --> 46:59.817
I am touched. Truly.

46:59.860 --> 47:02.907
May I ask,
what happened to your leg?

47:02.950 --> 47:04.952
Tennis accident.

47:10.001 --> 47:11.176
Thank you.

47:11.219 --> 47:12.394
Ah...

47:12.438 --> 47:13.831
Sorry.

47:18.357 --> 47:20.054
Look who's here.

47:26.191 --> 47:28.846
Look each other
in the eye and say,

47:28.889 --> 47:32.240
"I respect and love you."

47:32.284 --> 47:35.417
I respect and love you.

47:36.636 --> 47:39.247
I... Oh, for fuck's sake.

47:39.291 --> 47:41.206
I respect and love <i>you.</i>

47:41.249 --> 47:42.468
Good.

47:42.511 --> 47:44.122
Justice.

48:02.314 --> 48:05.926
It's different for me
than it was for you.

48:06.971 --> 48:08.537
What do you mean?

48:08.581 --> 48:11.540
When you fought,
you fought against white males,

48:11.584 --> 48:13.151
the dominant culture.

48:13.194 --> 48:15.718
But for me,
I would be up against...

48:15.762 --> 48:18.721
another dominated culture.

48:18.765 --> 48:20.419
Black lawyers.

48:22.508 --> 48:23.901
So what do I do?

48:24.902 --> 48:26.381
I don't know.

48:28.688 --> 48:31.386
If you knew that Obama

48:31.430 --> 48:35.956
was going to nominate
a Black justice to replace you,

48:36.000 --> 48:37.566
would you have stepped aside?

48:38.567 --> 48:39.786
No.

48:39.829 --> 48:41.483
Why not?

48:42.876 --> 48:45.357
Well, I know what I can do,

48:45.400 --> 48:48.316
but I-I don't know what
my replacement would do

48:48.360 --> 48:50.188
if he got nominated. I...

48:50.231 --> 48:53.408
What you know is always better
than what might happen.

48:53.452 --> 48:55.062
Mm.

48:59.327 --> 49:00.633
What about Kurt?

49:00.676 --> 49:02.983
What-what about him?

49:03.027 --> 49:04.942
We don't agree about anything.

49:06.508 --> 49:09.207
Well, I didn't agree on anything
with Scalia,

49:09.250 --> 49:11.252
but I-I liked him.

49:11.296 --> 49:12.993
Yeah. Why did you like him?

49:13.037 --> 49:14.212
The opera?

49:14.255 --> 49:15.691
No.

49:15.735 --> 49:16.997
What, then?

49:19.739 --> 49:21.001
He made me laugh.

49:22.481 --> 49:23.699
That's it?

49:25.353 --> 49:26.833
Yeah.

49:26.876 --> 49:28.966
You certainly didn't agree
about abortion.

49:29.009 --> 49:32.317
Oh. We-we violently disagreed
on abortion,

49:32.360 --> 49:34.145
and school prayer.

49:34.188 --> 49:36.495
He was a nightmare
on everything.

49:36.538 --> 49:38.584
He was a nightmare on diversity.

49:38.627 --> 49:40.064
But...?

49:40.107 --> 49:42.327
Well, it's... He was funny.

49:42.370 --> 49:44.372
He made me laugh and...

49:44.416 --> 49:46.679
so, we...

49:46.722 --> 49:48.376
We had dinner together.

49:48.420 --> 49:51.205
And you just wouldn't talk
about the political stuff?

49:51.249 --> 49:53.120
Well, he teased me

49:53.164 --> 49:54.817
and I teased him.

49:56.167 --> 49:59.170
You know, life is too short
to fight over everything.

49:59.213 --> 50:03.304
And, you're, you're,
you're right about opera.

50:03.348 --> 50:05.350
Opera is good.

50:05.393 --> 50:07.830
Food is good.

50:07.874 --> 50:10.833
And his pasta...

50:10.877 --> 50:12.574
was amazing.

50:12.618 --> 50:14.794
His spaghetti carbonara.

50:14.837 --> 50:16.970
Oh, my lord.

50:17.014 --> 50:19.668
-You can't hate a man like that.

50:24.717 --> 50:28.025
My husband is going to work
for the NRA.

50:29.983 --> 50:32.681
You ever read
Scalia's 2000 dissent

50:32.725 --> 50:35.684
on <i>Stenberg v. Carhart?</i>

50:36.990 --> 50:39.079
Working for the NRA

50:39.123 --> 50:40.907
is child's play.

50:42.474 --> 50:44.389
You know, you like who you like.

50:45.564 --> 50:47.348
I don't like bland people.

50:47.392 --> 50:49.133
And a lot of the people

50:49.176 --> 50:51.526
who agree with me politically
are bland.

51:05.888 --> 51:07.716
Thank you.

51:30.391 --> 51:31.914
Did you have a nightmare?

51:32.872 --> 51:34.613
No, a dream.

51:35.918 --> 51:37.311
About?

51:37.355 --> 51:39.270
You and me.

51:40.619 --> 51:42.011
What was it?

51:43.143 --> 51:44.623
Me...

51:44.666 --> 51:46.625
close to you,

51:46.668 --> 51:48.583
holding you like this.

51:54.328 --> 51:57.897
Do you want me
to not take the NRA job?

52:00.987 --> 52:04.643
No. I want you to take it
and be happy.

52:06.645 --> 52:08.299
-And then I'll sue you.
