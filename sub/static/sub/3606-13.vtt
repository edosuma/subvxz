00:00.301 --> 00:05.137
Kara: <i> When I was a child,</i>
<i> my planet Krypton was dying.</i>

00:05.139 --> 00:08.340
<i> I was sent to earth</i>
<i> to protect my cousin.</i>

00:08.342 --> 00:10.309
<i> But my pod got</i>
<i> knocked off-course</i>

00:10.311 --> 00:12.044
<i> and by the time I got here,</i>

00:12.046 --> 00:16.115
<i> my cousin</i>
<i> had already grown up</i>
<i> and become superman.</i>

00:16.117 --> 00:17.983
<i> And so I hid my powers</i>

00:17.985 --> 00:22.287
<i> until recently</i>
<i> when an accident forced me</i>
<i> to reveal myself to the world.</i>

00:22.289 --> 00:26.058
<i> To most people</i>
<i> I'm an assistant</i>
<i> at catco worldwide media.</i>

00:26.060 --> 00:29.595
<i> But in secret, I work with my</i>
<i> adoptive sister for the deo</i>

00:29.597 --> 00:31.497
<i> to protect my city</i>
<i> from alien life</i>

00:31.499 --> 00:34.400
<i> and anyone else</i>
<i> that means to cause it harm.</i>

00:35.569 --> 00:38.103
<i> I am Supergirl.</i>

00:38.105 --> 00:39.938
Kara:
<i> Previously on</i> Supergirl...

00:39.940 --> 00:41.507
The aliens didn't
take anything.

00:41.509 --> 00:43.308
-Winn: I shouldn't
have kissed you.
-Um...

00:43.310 --> 00:44.910
What does this mean for us?

00:44.912 --> 00:45.978
I don't know.

00:45.980 --> 00:47.279
Non: You didn't kill her.

00:47.281 --> 00:50.582
Was it her strength
or your weakness?

00:50.584 --> 00:52.851
Kara: My parents passed
away when I was 13.

00:52.853 --> 00:55.120
It's always been hard for me
to feel normal,

00:55.122 --> 00:57.256
like I'm where
I'm supposed to be.

01:09.303 --> 01:11.403
Electronic female voice:
<i> How are you feeling, Kara?</i>

01:11.405 --> 01:14.139
<i> -Reflexes are normal.</i>
-(Gasps)

01:15.676 --> 01:18.277
-What are you?
<i> -I am kelex,</i>
<i> your medical attendant.</i>

01:18.279 --> 01:23.082
-Where am I?
<i> -Your confusion will abate as</i>
<i> your temperature stabilizes.</i>

01:23.084 --> 01:24.683
<i> Would you care to dress?</i>

01:26.153 --> 01:28.087
This was my mother's tunic.

01:30.858 --> 01:34.359
She used to wear it when
she would put me to bed
at night.

01:37.698 --> 01:38.797
Where did you get this?

01:38.799 --> 01:40.299
I gave it to you.

01:41.969 --> 01:43.402
Mom?

01:45.072 --> 01:46.872
How could you be here?

01:46.874 --> 01:51.176
I stayed home every day
while you recovered
from the argo fever.

01:51.178 --> 01:52.845
This can't be real.

01:54.048 --> 01:55.881
You died with
the rest of Krypton.

01:55.883 --> 01:58.083
Oh, sweet Kara...

01:58.085 --> 02:01.220
You must have had terrible
hallucinations from the fever.

02:01.222 --> 02:02.354
But it's over now.

02:02.356 --> 02:04.189
You're awake. You're safe.

02:05.092 --> 02:06.425
You're home.

02:14.835 --> 02:16.368
Kara: I'm on Krypton.

02:23.277 --> 02:27.312
Cat: Where is ker-rah?
And why isn't she
answering her cell phone?

02:27.314 --> 02:29.314
Uh, you know,
maybe she can't...

02:29.316 --> 02:31.884
We're actually in the middle
of the worst solar storm
in recorded history.

02:31.886 --> 02:34.286
It's just been scrambling
communication signals
all morning.

02:34.288 --> 02:36.555
-I'm sure there's a...
There's a good reason.
-I know the reason.

02:36.557 --> 02:40.058
She's avoiding me.
She's obviously afraid
that I plan to retaliate

02:40.060 --> 02:41.593
because she drove my son away

02:41.595 --> 02:43.228
right when I was repairing
my relationship with him.

02:43.230 --> 02:46.298
But I am a professional.
I do not do upset.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.167
So you can tell ker-rah

02:48.169 --> 02:50.769
that it is safe for her
to resume her duties.

02:51.805 --> 02:53.505
(Both exhaling)

02:53.507 --> 02:54.740
Hey, hey, have you seen Kara?

02:54.742 --> 02:56.275
She, she still hasn't
come in yet.

02:56.277 --> 02:58.343
No. I haven't been able
to reach her either.

02:58.345 --> 02:59.811
Okay, that is so not Kara.

02:59.813 --> 03:01.113
Both: We should call Alex.

03:01.115 --> 03:02.648
She's not out on deo business.

03:02.650 --> 03:04.550
(Sighs) There's nothing on
the news about Supergirl.

03:04.552 --> 03:05.984
I got a bad feeling
about this.

03:05.986 --> 03:07.753
-You bring your key?
-Yeah.

03:10.090 --> 03:12.391
-Kara?
-Oh, my god!

03:14.395 --> 03:16.862
Winn: What... what is that?
Alex: Don't touch it.

03:19.700 --> 03:22.267
(Stammers) She... she's
still breathing. I...

03:24.738 --> 03:27.940
This is agent danvers.
I need a medical evac now.

03:27.942 --> 03:29.675
She was found unconscious.

03:29.677 --> 03:32.644
The organism is gripping
her torso with over
100 pounds of pressure.

03:35.416 --> 03:37.416
What the hell are
these guys doing here?

03:37.418 --> 03:39.685
-Where Supergirl goes, we go.
-This is a top secret
facility, Mr. Olsen.

03:39.687 --> 03:41.520
You think I'm gonna let the
media waltz through here?

03:41.522 --> 03:43.155
Actually, I'm in it.

03:43.157 --> 03:46.258
So, definitely
not worth, uh, shooting.

03:47.795 --> 03:49.561
If something happens to her,
I'm coming back for you.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.463
If anything happens to her,
i won't stop you.

03:51.465 --> 03:54.366
Get them out of here.

03:54.368 --> 03:57.703
You are clearly in need of
a refresher course on
base security protocol.

03:57.705 --> 04:01.006
You don't know
them like I do, sir.
They're Kara's family.

04:01.008 --> 04:03.842
-And what's her condition?
-She's unresponsive
to outside stimuli,

04:03.844 --> 04:05.744
but her brain activity
is still normal.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.146
It's like her body is unaware
that anything is wrong.

04:08.148 --> 04:09.348
Hank: What the
hell is that thing?

04:09.350 --> 04:10.983
Alex: I have no idea.

04:10.985 --> 04:12.985
But I think we know
someone who does.

04:16.357 --> 04:18.590
Agent danvers.
What a surprise.

04:18.592 --> 04:21.893
You haven't visited since
you threw me in my
collectible display case.

04:21.895 --> 04:22.995
(Whooshing)

04:27.468 --> 04:28.767
How do I get that
thing off of Kara?

04:28.769 --> 04:30.335
You may have to be
a tad more specific.

04:30.337 --> 04:32.571
Don't test my Patience, Max.

04:32.573 --> 04:34.339
You tried to kill Kara
with bizarro.

04:34.341 --> 04:36.908
I'm guessing you designed
this new freak
to finish the job.

04:36.910 --> 04:39.077
I'm flattered that I've made
such a lasting impression
on you,

04:39.079 --> 04:40.412
but the truth is

04:40.414 --> 04:42.014
I don't know what
you're talking about.

04:42.016 --> 04:44.516
I advise you start to make
yourself much more useful.

04:44.518 --> 04:46.151
-And fast!
-Alex, stand down!

04:46.153 --> 04:47.953
He's got to be behind this.
You know what he's capable of.

04:47.955 --> 04:50.088
-Hank henshaw: Come on.
Come on!
-(Alex grunting)

04:50.090 --> 04:52.357
I also know Max is a survivor.

04:52.359 --> 04:53.625
If he knew anything,

04:53.627 --> 04:55.427
he'd tell us to
save his own neck.

04:55.429 --> 04:58.764
I never thought
I'd say this, but...
Thanks for the assist.

04:58.766 --> 05:01.933
If we find out you're lying,
she comes back down here...

05:01.935 --> 05:03.335
Alone.

05:09.076 --> 05:12.177
Non: The humans remain
unaware of our plans.

05:12.179 --> 05:15.614
The solar storm is
wreaking havoc on
their satellite system.

05:15.616 --> 05:19.051
We will be ready the moment
their network goes down.

05:19.053 --> 05:20.585
You forget my niece.

05:20.587 --> 05:22.621
She has proven to be
a willful opponent.

05:22.623 --> 05:23.989
She will not be a problem.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.059
What have you done, non?

05:28.395 --> 05:30.395
I gave orders for her
to remain unharmed.

05:30.397 --> 05:32.497
And I obeyed them
to the letter.

05:34.468 --> 05:37.269
Kara Zor-El is at peace,

05:37.271 --> 05:39.404
which is more
than she deserves.

05:39.406 --> 05:41.773
She has everything
her heart desires.

05:41.775 --> 05:43.508
You used a black mercy on her?

05:43.510 --> 05:46.078
If it were up to me,
she'd be dead.

05:46.080 --> 05:51.683
Astra, the time has come
for us to implement
the next phase of myriad.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.485
This was the only way.

05:53.487 --> 05:55.053
There is always another way.

05:55.055 --> 05:56.688
Your sister thought that.

05:57.491 --> 05:58.857
Look what it got her.

06:03.564 --> 06:06.698
Alex: The claw is made
of a titanium alloy.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.867
We just need to pull it off
slow and steady.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.436
Claw is secure.
Commence extraction.

06:14.007 --> 06:16.041
(Grunting)

06:16.043 --> 06:17.209
Her heart rate is spiking.

06:17.211 --> 06:18.343
Brain waves are
off the charts.

06:18.345 --> 06:19.711
Increase the power.

06:20.447 --> 06:22.147
Pull it off her!

06:23.016 --> 06:25.384
(Machine revving)

06:25.386 --> 06:27.652
She's crashing.
I'm stopping it. I...

06:27.654 --> 06:29.087
(Machine powers down)

06:29.823 --> 06:31.056
What the hell happened here?

06:31.058 --> 06:33.992
(Exhales) It's a
symbiotic defense.

06:33.994 --> 06:36.862
If we pull that thing
out by force,

06:36.864 --> 06:38.096
it'll kill Kara.

06:41.135 --> 06:43.402
Kara: This can't be happening.
I have to get out of here.

06:43.404 --> 06:45.070
-(Labored breathing)
-Kara, please calm down.

06:45.072 --> 06:46.938
I don't have my powers.

06:46.940 --> 06:49.608
Whatever's behind this
is mimicking the
effects of Krypton's sun.

06:49.610 --> 06:50.876
We are on Krypton.

06:50.878 --> 06:53.345
What? No, someone is
manipulating me

06:53.347 --> 06:55.981
by using my memories
against me.

06:58.218 --> 06:59.751
Do you see that?

06:59.753 --> 07:01.887
I made it for my father
when I was eight.

07:05.459 --> 07:07.292
(Chuckles)

07:07.294 --> 07:10.362
I even remember getting upset
i couldn't get
the wings right.

07:10.364 --> 07:13.365
And then he told you
it was perfect.

07:13.367 --> 07:15.467
And that he loved it, and you,

07:15.469 --> 07:17.402
with all his heart.

07:17.404 --> 07:19.738
He made me feel so proud.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.808
And so happy.

07:24.178 --> 07:25.243
(Chuckles) Like he always did.

07:25.245 --> 07:26.711
(Chuckles) See?

07:27.381 --> 07:28.914
You do remember.

07:31.185 --> 07:35.787
But I also remember
saying goodbye to you
on that launch bay.

07:35.789 --> 07:38.290
And promising to
take care of Clark...

07:38.292 --> 07:39.724
Kal-El.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.561
And hugging you so tight.

07:43.597 --> 07:45.197
Never wanting to let go.

07:50.137 --> 07:54.072
I've fantasized about all of
this every day since I left.

07:56.310 --> 07:59.511
I don't know how
this is happening,
but I'm going to find out.

07:59.513 --> 08:02.814
And when I do, I'm going home.

08:09.490 --> 08:12.157
-(Elevator bell dings)
-It just feels wrong
pretending everything is fine

08:12.159 --> 08:14.559
when Kara's back there
fighting for her life.

08:14.561 --> 08:16.962
Winn, this is
Kara's life, okay.

08:16.964 --> 08:19.030
You and I know that
better than anybody.

08:19.032 --> 08:21.833
This is why we have
to protect it for her.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.569
Ah, it's not just that.
It's like...

08:24.571 --> 08:26.371
Kara and i
were not in good place

08:26.373 --> 08:28.373
before all this happened.
What if something goes wrong

08:28.375 --> 08:30.876
and then I never get
the chance to tell her...

08:30.878 --> 08:32.277
Winn.

08:32.279 --> 08:33.845
Please, don't think like that.

08:34.882 --> 08:36.781
She's gonna be fine, okay?

08:38.185 --> 08:39.251
Mmm-hmm.

08:46.560 --> 08:49.027
Who allowed this cheap
arrangement in here?

08:49.029 --> 08:52.063
And where have you been?
And where is ker-rah?

08:53.534 --> 08:55.166
Kara, um...

08:55.168 --> 08:57.002
Use your words.

08:57.004 --> 08:58.904
I... yes, I...

08:58.906 --> 09:01.339
I... you know, I did
see Kara, miss Grant.

09:01.341 --> 09:03.842
She was bitten by a tic.

09:03.844 --> 09:05.510
She's had a horrible
allergic reaction.

09:05.512 --> 09:07.112
Yeah. So, swelling,
vomiting...

09:07.114 --> 09:10.382
Oh, god, she had these
swollen ankles,
it was awful. And I...

09:10.384 --> 09:12.484
You know, you should've
seen the size of this tic.

09:12.486 --> 09:14.419
(Chuckling) This
thing was like...

09:14.421 --> 09:17.322
(Stuttering) She... it was
normal size. It was...

09:17.324 --> 09:20.258
You know, small... it was
actually a bunch of little...

09:20.260 --> 09:24.062
Little ones like lice.
It was... Kara's lice.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.631
I have been watching
you cover for her

09:26.633 --> 09:28.199
day after day,

09:28.201 --> 09:31.369
putting yourself and
your job in jeopardy.

09:31.371 --> 09:33.538
And for what?

09:33.540 --> 09:37.409
Now, you tell her that she
is expected to be back
at her desk within the hour

09:37.411 --> 09:41.146
or she can kiss this little
mediocre job goodbye.

09:43.650 --> 09:46.585
Unless someone has
a better way of monitoring
alien life on earth,

09:46.587 --> 09:48.987
I need my satellite
signal back.

09:48.989 --> 09:50.188
Now!

09:51.925 --> 09:53.291
Alex: I know you're
upset about Kara,

09:53.293 --> 09:55.093
but don't take it out
on the troops.

09:57.431 --> 10:00.432
This must be hard on you, too.

10:00.434 --> 10:03.568
(Exhales deeply)
It's been a tough
couple of weeks for Kara.

10:03.570 --> 10:05.070
I got a call from James Olsen.

10:05.072 --> 10:08.106
Cat's gonna fire her
unless she shows up for work.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.542
Her friends are doing
the best that they can
to cover for her,

10:10.544 --> 10:13.211
but... they need help.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.747
Catco is more
than a job to Kara.

10:15.749 --> 10:18.817
It's where she gets
to live a normal life.

10:18.819 --> 10:20.552
You know, for all
that she does

10:20.554 --> 10:24.122
for the deo and, and for us.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.991
I just think that it's our
responsibility to make sure

10:25.993 --> 10:28.059
that that life
is waiting for her

10:28.061 --> 10:29.728
-when she wakes up.
-All right.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.096
What can I do?

10:32.065 --> 10:33.131
(Sighs)

10:44.411 --> 10:45.577
Winn: Kara?

10:45.579 --> 10:47.912
-Hey! You're back!
-(Chuckling)

10:47.914 --> 10:49.781
Sorry to disappoint you,
Mr. schott,

10:49.783 --> 10:52.117
but miss danvers
is still incapacitated.

10:52.119 --> 10:54.519
Well... well, then,
who are you?

10:54.521 --> 10:57.555
An agent of the deo
sent to maintain
miss danver's cover

10:57.557 --> 10:59.591
until she's able
to return herself.

10:59.593 --> 11:01.993
So, is that like
an organic bio-mass?

11:01.995 --> 11:03.461
Touch my face,
lose your hand.

11:03.463 --> 11:04.763
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

11:04.765 --> 11:06.264
Do you know what you're
getting yourself into?

11:06.266 --> 11:09.200
I mean, have you ever been
an assistant before?

11:09.202 --> 11:12.270
I'm an elite agent
of an intergalactic
paramilitary force.

11:12.272 --> 11:14.773
I think I can handle
cat Grant.

11:20.414 --> 11:24.883
Oh, how lovely for you
to come in to the office
on a weekday, no less.

11:24.885 --> 11:28.153
You are a real hero, Carla.

11:28.155 --> 11:30.321
Was there a reason you
called me in, miss Grant?

11:30.323 --> 11:31.389
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:31.391 --> 11:33.391
I'm just dealing
with a little story

11:33.393 --> 11:36.795
about a solar storm that
threatens all global commerce

11:36.797 --> 11:39.497
and promises civilian unrest.

11:39.499 --> 11:40.765
Hmm.

11:41.902 --> 11:45.136
Yes! Book me interviews
with Barbara at NASA,

11:45.138 --> 11:47.472
Eduardo at the NSA
and Gina at the white house.

11:47.474 --> 11:50.175
And I want attributable
quotes, no press releases.

11:50.177 --> 11:52.077
And if they try to evade you,

11:52.079 --> 11:54.879
you remind them
I'm still holding on to
their <i> Hamilton</i> tickets.

11:54.881 --> 11:57.449
Wait, uh, Eduardo...

11:58.118 --> 11:59.918
Ella... who?

11:59.920 --> 12:01.920
Oh, first base. Keep up.

12:03.490 --> 12:04.923
Mmm! Mmm!

12:07.294 --> 12:09.694
-What kind of milk is in this?
-Whole, ma'am.

12:09.696 --> 12:12.330
Whole milk has not
passed my lips

12:12.332 --> 12:14.399
since I rode a bicycle with
streamers on the handles.

12:18.438 --> 12:21.506
Well, perhaps if you were
clearer with instructions,

12:21.508 --> 12:25.210
there would be less
of an issue with execution.

12:25.212 --> 12:27.846
Well, I am so glad to see
that you are so comfortable

12:27.848 --> 12:29.647
that you can speak
so honestly.

12:29.649 --> 12:32.083
Allow me to do
the same for you.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.753
All this time you've been
prancing around my office,

12:34.755 --> 12:37.155
pretending to be
someone you're not.

12:37.157 --> 12:39.824
Well, I see the real you.

12:39.826 --> 12:42.227
And I cannot un-see it.

12:42.229 --> 12:46.431
So I'd advise you to strap in.

12:54.708 --> 12:56.074
(Exhales)

12:56.076 --> 12:58.309
That woman makes me
miss my alien prison.

13:00.013 --> 13:02.981
The creature wasn't
a prisoner on fort rozz.

13:02.983 --> 13:05.250
But do you have
a planet of origin?

13:05.252 --> 13:07.385
-Is it sentient?
<i> -I am sorry.</i>

13:07.387 --> 13:10.054
<i> I do not have sufficient</i>
<i> information regarding</i>
<i> this species.</i>

13:10.056 --> 13:11.956
Kara is in trouble.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.625
And nothing I am doing
is working.

13:13.627 --> 13:15.960
<i> I do not have sufficient data</i>
<i> regarding this species...</i>

13:15.962 --> 13:18.997
Damn it! Kara
is relying on me!

13:18.999 --> 13:21.699
She has always relied on me...

13:21.701 --> 13:25.003
Ever since you sent her here.

13:25.005 --> 13:28.773
I'm sure you had hoped
that she would find people
that would take care of her.

13:28.775 --> 13:31.209
Who would love her like
she was their own.

13:32.813 --> 13:34.078
I did.

13:37.784 --> 13:41.586
I only wish I'd been
a better sister to her
when she first got here.

13:43.523 --> 13:44.589
I can't...

13:46.359 --> 13:50.028
I can't even
imagine it now.
(Voice breaking)

13:50.030 --> 13:52.197
I used to resent her

13:53.366 --> 13:55.400
for coming into my home.

13:55.402 --> 13:58.436
For following me
around at school.

13:58.438 --> 14:02.373
Some strange girl who
didn't know how to fit in.

14:04.044 --> 14:07.312
For embarrassing me
in front of my friends.

14:11.952 --> 14:14.485
But all Kara wanted
was a family.

14:16.056 --> 14:18.556
And that's what she is to me.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.525
She is my sister.

14:20.527 --> 14:25.496
(Sniffles) And she needs
me now more than ever.

14:25.498 --> 14:27.999
So please.

14:28.001 --> 14:31.469
Tell me how to help
my little sister!

14:31.471 --> 14:36.441
<i> I do not have sufficient</i>
<i> information regarding</i>
<i> this species.</i>

14:36.443 --> 14:39.077
I don't understand.
Something has to
be causing this.

14:39.079 --> 14:40.745
Kara, nothing is wrong.

14:40.747 --> 14:42.413
I told you.
You're safe at home.

14:42.415 --> 14:45.083
This is not my home.
My home is back on...

14:46.519 --> 14:48.219
Back on...

14:49.289 --> 14:50.388
Earth!

14:50.390 --> 14:52.357
Earth is thousands
of light years away.

14:52.359 --> 14:54.826
And why would I ever send you
to that primitive planet?

14:54.828 --> 14:56.895
(Labored breathing)

15:05.972 --> 15:07.238
Kara.

15:08.308 --> 15:09.374
Father?

15:12.612 --> 15:14.279
No. No, this is...

15:14.281 --> 15:17.248
Cannot be real.
This is not real.
This is not real.

15:19.552 --> 15:21.119
It's the fever again.

15:25.058 --> 15:27.091
I remember playing
right there.

15:27.093 --> 15:30.361
And I made this crack

15:30.363 --> 15:33.431
when I tripped chasing
after aunt astra.

15:33.433 --> 15:37.735
Yet, even after you fell,
you got right back up again.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.637
Nothing can keep you down.

15:43.176 --> 15:45.176
You did this to me!

15:45.178 --> 15:47.178
-You, you did this to me!
-Alura: Kara, stop!

15:47.180 --> 15:48.346
-Stop it.
-No! I understand now.

15:48.348 --> 15:49.914
You and non are behind this.

15:49.916 --> 15:52.917
Non? But he was banished to
the phantom zone ages ago.

15:52.919 --> 15:56.554
No, I fought both of you
days ago back on...

15:57.624 --> 15:58.690
Um...

16:00.760 --> 16:02.126
Why can't I remember?

16:02.128 --> 16:03.962
All nightmares end the
longer we are awake.

16:03.964 --> 16:05.897
Kara: No, wait...
I still... I feel it.

16:05.899 --> 16:07.598
I have glimpses of...

16:09.302 --> 16:12.103
-...flying.
-We only fly in
our dreams, Kara.

16:12.105 --> 16:15.239
I have friends there
who need me.

16:15.942 --> 16:17.175
Family...

16:17.177 --> 16:18.476
Kal-El: Kara.

16:21.748 --> 16:23.081
Kal-El.

16:26.186 --> 16:28.453
-Do you remember
how to open it?
-(Chuckling)

16:32.993 --> 16:35.259
-(Beeping)
-(Sniffling)

16:38.765 --> 16:40.164
Kal-El: Look, Kara.

16:40.166 --> 16:41.966
There's Krypton.

16:41.968 --> 16:43.468
Isn't it beautiful?

16:44.537 --> 16:46.070
It's so beautiful.

17:03.556 --> 17:06.858
-(Choking)
-I came here to help
Kara, not fight.

17:06.860 --> 17:09.894
(Gasping for breath)

17:09.896 --> 17:12.397
You tried to kill her before.
Why should I trust you now?

17:12.399 --> 17:15.500
Kara's saved me from
a death without honor.

17:15.502 --> 17:18.336
As a fellow soldier,
i expect you understand
the meaning of that.

17:21.041 --> 17:22.540
Kara has been attacked

17:22.542 --> 17:25.176
by a telepathic parasite
known as the black mercy.

17:25.178 --> 17:27.011
It has her in some
kind of coma.

17:27.013 --> 17:29.213
Her brain waves
are still active.
It's like as if she's awake.

17:29.215 --> 17:33.084
The black mercy
has her trapped
in lifelike hallucinations.

17:33.086 --> 17:34.852
Her perfect fantasy life.

17:34.854 --> 17:37.755
One that grows more
and more real with
each passing moment.

17:37.757 --> 17:39.090
How do I wake her out of it?

17:39.092 --> 17:40.892
Kara must reject
the fantasy herself.

17:40.894 --> 17:43.995
But if she doesn't
know it isn't real,
how can she reject it?

17:43.997 --> 17:46.097
I can tell you
how to help her.

17:48.134 --> 17:49.567
But you have to trust me.

17:49.569 --> 17:52.703
The last time I trusted you,
six soldiers died.

17:59.779 --> 18:02.413
I knew there was more
to you and my niece.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.850
She's my sister.

18:05.852 --> 18:09.153
If she is your sister
and I am her aunt,

18:09.155 --> 18:11.089
what does that make us?

18:11.091 --> 18:12.356
Nothing.

18:13.593 --> 18:16.461
Do not allow your hatred
for me blind you now.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.497
Are you ready to listen?

18:19.499 --> 18:20.565
Or not.

18:24.003 --> 18:26.104
Winn: Okay, so...
So you were her?

18:26.106 --> 18:27.872
I don't have time
for explanations.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.774
There is no way
you are doing this.
This is way too risky.

18:29.776 --> 18:32.977
It's the only way
that we can stop
the black mercy.

18:32.979 --> 18:35.012
We can modify
our virtual reality tech

18:35.014 --> 18:36.948
so that I can enter
into Kara's mind

18:36.950 --> 18:39.083
and convince her
to reject the hallucination.

18:39.085 --> 18:41.085
Unless astra's playing you.

18:41.087 --> 18:43.688
Have either of you considered
what would happen to Kara
if you do this?

18:43.690 --> 18:45.890
You're basically yanking
her out of heaven.

18:45.892 --> 18:47.325
I mean, that's gonna be
slightly traumatic.

18:47.327 --> 18:48.860
Agent danvers
has considered it,

18:48.862 --> 18:51.095
which is why she came here.

18:51.097 --> 18:54.532
Kara is gonna need James
and winn by her side
when she wakes up.

18:54.534 --> 18:56.567
-I know there are
security issues...
-Take them.

18:56.569 --> 18:58.369
Take them.

18:58.371 --> 19:00.004
I thought I was gonna have
to argue that point
a lot harder.

19:00.006 --> 19:02.440
I'm beginning to see why
she values them so much.

19:04.477 --> 19:08.246
I'll see you back at the deo,
after I deal with cat.

19:11.718 --> 19:15.286
Miss Grant... if I may?

19:15.288 --> 19:19.557
It's clear I've caused you
significant emotional distress

19:19.559 --> 19:21.959
and I want you to know
that pains me a great deal.

19:21.961 --> 19:24.162
What, are you resigning
from congress?

19:25.765 --> 19:28.232
I just think considering
our personal issues,

19:28.234 --> 19:30.434
it might be wise for me
to take the day and...

19:30.436 --> 19:31.802
Uh, uh, hold on.

19:31.804 --> 19:34.071
Hold on, I want
to record this.

19:34.073 --> 19:38.976
It sounds an awful lot like
you're asking for the day off
after being three hours late.

19:44.450 --> 19:46.117
(Exhales deeply)

19:47.287 --> 19:49.987
The truth is... (Sniffling)

19:49.989 --> 19:53.291
I am so very
sorry, miss Grant.

19:53.293 --> 19:55.793
Because I respect you so much.

19:55.795 --> 19:57.728
And I never meant to hurt you.

19:57.730 --> 19:59.330
Or Adam.

20:00.934 --> 20:02.333
Of course not.

20:03.002 --> 20:05.336
Him... uh...

20:05.338 --> 20:07.505
I just don't know
what came over me.

20:07.507 --> 20:12.677
Ker-rah, what is the most
important thing I told you
when I hired you?

20:12.679 --> 20:16.314
-No whole milk in the lattes?
-No crying at work.

20:16.316 --> 20:20.151
Ever. Especially not big,
fat crocodile tears.

20:20.153 --> 20:22.019
Do you really think that you
can come into my office

20:22.021 --> 20:25.856
and manipulate me
with this catskills
summer stock performance?

20:25.858 --> 20:28.025
No.

20:28.027 --> 20:30.828
But by all means,
take the day off

20:30.830 --> 20:33.998
because I cannot stomach
looking at you any longer.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.438
Hey, Kara.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.973
Wake up.

20:50.683 --> 20:52.083
How'd it go with cat Grant?

20:52.085 --> 20:54.785
Let's deal with
one disaster at a time.

20:54.787 --> 20:56.954
Can the lab modify the vr?

20:56.956 --> 20:58.256
Merging my consciousness
with Kara's

20:58.258 --> 21:00.524
is beyond anything
they've ever done.

21:00.526 --> 21:01.993
They need days.

21:01.995 --> 21:03.594
Which is time
she doesn't have.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.596
We may have another problem.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.698
Kryptonian technology
would've been able to
predict these solar storms.

21:07.700 --> 21:11.569
The timing of the attack
on Kara can't be
a coincidence.

21:11.571 --> 21:14.372
They're using the interface
of the storms to hide
their next move.

21:15.074 --> 21:17.441
We need a miracle. Now.

21:17.443 --> 21:20.111
Is that why you had
your goons bring me
up here, agent danvers?

21:21.314 --> 21:23.281
My sister needs your help.

21:24.117 --> 21:26.517
Maybe I help her, you help me.

21:26.519 --> 21:29.153
Something like, "early release
for brilliant behavior?"

21:29.155 --> 21:31.055
That's not on the table.

21:31.057 --> 21:32.523
Then how about
a case of dr pepper

21:32.525 --> 21:34.592
and access to
my netflix account?

21:34.594 --> 21:38.429
The same aliens that
attacked your lab are
coming back for more.

21:38.431 --> 21:40.531
"The enemy of your enemy,"
right?

21:44.170 --> 21:45.670
What do you need me to do?

21:47.173 --> 21:50.041
We will hit the six targets
simultaneously.

21:50.043 --> 21:51.442
Timing is of the essence.

21:51.444 --> 21:53.177
The packages must be deployed

21:53.179 --> 21:55.680
before the humans have
a chance to uncover our plan.

21:55.682 --> 22:00.117
This is what we fought so hard
for back on Krypton.

22:00.119 --> 22:03.120
Now is our chance
to finish the job.

22:03.122 --> 22:04.422
Ready your men.

22:12.865 --> 22:15.399
Where were you earlier?

22:16.135 --> 22:17.968
You dare question me?

22:17.970 --> 22:21.005
We are on the verge of
launching our campaign
against the humans

22:21.007 --> 22:22.940
and you disappear
without explanation.

22:22.942 --> 22:26.177
So yes, I dare question you.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.347
Then ask me.

22:30.817 --> 22:33.084
Is your heart in this war?

22:34.620 --> 22:36.387
Once myriad is complete,

22:36.389 --> 22:39.924
humanity will be
brought to its knees,

22:39.926 --> 22:42.026
and this planet will be saved.

22:46.099 --> 22:47.732
I was afraid you went
to the humans

22:47.734 --> 22:49.734
because of what I did
to your niece.

22:51.237 --> 22:54.105
Forgive me for questioning
your loyalty.

23:01.447 --> 23:03.481
James.

23:03.483 --> 23:04.915
I need a favor.

23:04.917 --> 23:06.317
Name it.

23:07.186 --> 23:09.153
I know director henshaw.

23:09.155 --> 23:11.255
If he thinks I'm in trouble
when I'm plugged
into that thing,

23:11.257 --> 23:14.925
he's gonna pull me out,
whether I've saved Kara
or not.

23:14.927 --> 23:17.027
I need you to stop him.

23:17.029 --> 23:18.429
I either come back
with my sister,

23:18.431 --> 23:20.131
or I don't come back at all.

23:28.307 --> 23:31.008
The helmet will instantly
connect you to
Supergirl's consciousness.

23:31.010 --> 23:33.177
That will allow you to
experience whatever's going on

23:33.179 --> 23:35.045
in Supergirl's head
in real time.

23:35.047 --> 23:36.781
It's pretty
brilliant actually.

23:36.783 --> 23:39.717
Remember, you have to
get Supergirl to reject
this fantasy herself.

23:45.224 --> 23:46.824
Come back to us, Kara.

23:48.161 --> 23:49.994
We need you.

23:49.996 --> 23:51.629
Alex: Is this going to work?

23:51.631 --> 23:52.830
Don't know.

23:56.903 --> 23:58.869
(Exhales) Sweet dreams.

24:01.774 --> 24:02.840
(Beeps)

24:05.645 --> 24:07.578
(Gasps) Kara!

24:16.756 --> 24:18.956
Oh, my god.

24:18.958 --> 24:20.458
I'm on Krypton.

24:24.964 --> 24:27.698
Sir, the storm's knocked
the satellites offline.
We're blind.

24:27.700 --> 24:29.433
We need them back
up and running
if we have any hope

24:29.435 --> 24:31.168
of discovering
non's next move.

24:31.170 --> 24:34.104
Have you guys considered
non's next move, um,

24:34.106 --> 24:36.841
involves the satellites
going down?

24:36.843 --> 24:40.311
I mean, he could be using our
own technology against us.

24:40.313 --> 24:42.746
That's an interesting theory,
Mr. schott.

24:42.748 --> 24:44.315
Care to explore it
with my team?

24:44.317 --> 24:46.450
Uh, no, I need to
be there for Kara.

24:46.452 --> 24:48.219
The best thing you can
do for Supergirl

24:48.221 --> 24:50.588
is keep the world
turning until she gets
back to defend it.

24:50.590 --> 24:53.257
-Uh, point me to a computer.
-Let's go.

25:03.202 --> 25:04.969
Alura: Kara was a
natural in court today.

25:04.971 --> 25:07.404
Kal-El, you would've been
so proud of your cousin.

25:07.406 --> 25:10.474
Zor-El: I noticed your mother
and I were not the only ones
who came to watch you today.

25:10.476 --> 25:12.910
Alura: Del-or seems like
a very nice young man.

25:12.912 --> 25:14.211
Zor-El: Boy.

25:14.213 --> 25:15.779
-And yes, I like
him very much.
-(Chuckles)

25:15.781 --> 25:17.248
Clearly, Kara does, too,

25:17.250 --> 25:19.717
or she would not be
spending so much of
her free time with him.

25:19.719 --> 25:21.785
Father! (Laughing)

25:21.787 --> 25:22.853
Alex: Kara.

25:23.422 --> 25:24.522
Kara...

25:27.960 --> 25:30.961
-Who are you?
-It's me.

25:30.963 --> 25:32.296
Alex.

25:33.633 --> 25:36.267
-Your sister.
-I have no sister.

25:36.269 --> 25:39.837
Kara, you're suffering from
the effects of a creature
called the black mercy.

25:39.839 --> 25:42.873
It's created this illusion
to incapacitate you
back on earth.

25:42.875 --> 25:46.844
-Earth?
-It's where you've been
for the past 12 years.

25:46.846 --> 25:48.279
I've come to take you home.

25:48.781 --> 25:49.914
I am home.

25:55.721 --> 25:57.054
(Grunting)

25:57.056 --> 25:58.322
(Beeping)

25:58.324 --> 26:00.224
We're losing her.
Pull her out now!

26:00.226 --> 26:02.493
Sorry, Supergirl. Guess
it just wasn't your day.

26:02.495 --> 26:04.194
-I can't let you do that.
-Olsen.

26:04.196 --> 26:07.331
-Get out of his way.
-If we pull her out now,
we lose Kara!

26:10.102 --> 26:12.603
We're safe, kal. I'm here.

26:13.105 --> 26:14.371
(Gasps)

26:15.207 --> 26:16.707
Anyone have some popcorn?

26:16.709 --> 26:19.243
Director henshaw, I know
you're worried about Alex,

26:19.245 --> 26:21.378
but I'm begging you,
give her some more time!

26:23.849 --> 26:26.617
I am the one responsible
for her safety.

26:26.619 --> 26:28.619
This is on my head, Olsen!

26:30.890 --> 26:33.624
-Well, she asked
me to stop you.
-What?

26:33.626 --> 26:35.826
She knew that you would react
this way if things went bad.

26:35.828 --> 26:38.562
So she came to me because
she wants to save Kara.

26:38.564 --> 26:39.964
Hank henshaw: You think
i don't want that?

26:39.966 --> 26:41.498
I want them both back.

26:43.436 --> 26:45.336
-More than anything.
-I know you do.

26:45.338 --> 26:46.971
And I can also see that Alex

26:46.973 --> 26:49.773
is more than just
one of your agents.

26:49.775 --> 26:50.808
She's family.

26:50.810 --> 26:52.810
And you want to protect
her at all costs.

26:52.812 --> 26:54.411
I get that.

26:54.413 --> 26:56.614
But if you pull her out
before she has a chance
to save her sister,

26:56.616 --> 26:58.449
she will never look at you
the same way again.

26:58.451 --> 26:59.717
You know that.

27:01.821 --> 27:03.687
I can't lose her.

27:03.689 --> 27:04.755
And you won't.

27:07.460 --> 27:10.628
'Cause Alex is
a lot like Supergirl.

27:12.264 --> 27:14.365
She always finds a way.

27:14.367 --> 27:16.000
You just have to trust her.

27:22.842 --> 27:24.375
(Gasps)

27:24.377 --> 27:27.845
The high council has rendered
our verdict on the alien spy.

27:28.714 --> 27:30.814
We impose the maximum penalty.

27:30.816 --> 27:32.983
Banishment to
the phantom zone.

27:32.985 --> 27:36.754
Kara, if they take me away,
you and I will be trapped here

27:36.756 --> 27:38.355
until the black mercy
kills us.

27:38.357 --> 27:39.590
Zor-El: Do not listen to her.

27:39.592 --> 27:41.592
Once she is gone,
we'll be happy.

27:41.594 --> 27:43.127
Like we were before
she came here.

27:43.129 --> 27:44.895
Alex: Why do you think
they're trying to silence me?

27:44.897 --> 27:46.897
It's because they're afraid
of what I have to say!

27:46.899 --> 27:48.732
She's trying to
confuse you with lies.

27:48.734 --> 27:51.435
Alex: No! I'm trying to
remind you of the truth.

27:51.437 --> 27:53.671
(Sobbing) Life isn't perfect.

27:53.673 --> 27:56.407
I know it can be hard
and it can be lonely.

27:56.409 --> 27:58.542
Especially for you.

27:58.544 --> 28:00.244
You have sacrificed

28:00.246 --> 28:01.779
and you have lost so much.

28:01.781 --> 28:04.515
I wish you could've
had a life with your family.

28:04.517 --> 28:08.285
But even if you did,
Kara, it wouldn't be this.

28:08.287 --> 28:11.789
Because this isn't real.

28:11.791 --> 28:16.894
-And deep down, Kara.
Deep down, you know it.
-(Rumbling)

28:16.896 --> 28:19.296
I can't promise you a life
without pain and loss

28:19.298 --> 28:21.565
because pain
is a part of life.

28:21.567 --> 28:24.368
It's what makes us who we are.

28:24.370 --> 28:26.937
It is what makes you a hero.

28:29.008 --> 28:30.774
(Grunting)

28:39.952 --> 28:44.855
You fight every day
to keep people from
struggling like you have.

28:44.857 --> 28:46.890
I know you can remember,
please...

28:46.892 --> 28:50.828
If you try, please...
Please try, Kara.

28:50.830 --> 28:53.697
Because earth needs Supergirl.

28:55.968 --> 28:57.434
Supergirl.

28:57.436 --> 28:59.336
Yes, remember that life.

28:59.338 --> 29:01.939
With James and winn and Hank.

29:01.941 --> 29:03.674
Your friends need you.

29:04.343 --> 29:06.043
And I need my sister!

29:06.846 --> 29:08.579
(Loud rumbling)

29:08.581 --> 29:11.949
(Sobbing) Kara,
i can't choose this for you.

29:11.951 --> 29:13.951
You have to
choose it yourself.

29:14.820 --> 29:16.420
-(Grunting)
-(Groans)

29:17.323 --> 29:19.156
(Alex panting)

29:21.460 --> 29:23.527
Please come back
to us, Kara. Please.

29:31.504 --> 29:33.070
I wish...

29:37.877 --> 29:40.878
I want so much for
all of this to be true.

29:43.983 --> 29:45.649
To stay here with you.

29:50.422 --> 29:52.189
But this isn't real.

29:52.191 --> 29:53.824
Kal-El: No. No!

29:59.565 --> 30:01.765
You taught me to be so strong.

30:02.968 --> 30:04.134
And I am.

30:05.004 --> 30:06.069
(Inaudible)

30:08.841 --> 30:11.074
Krypton will be
in my heart forever.

30:12.144 --> 30:13.343
But Alex is right...

30:13.345 --> 30:15.712
My sister is right.

30:18.050 --> 30:19.383
I have to go.

30:19.385 --> 30:20.951
(Loud rumbling)

30:22.655 --> 30:24.488
-I love you.
-Oh, Kara...

30:26.625 --> 30:28.659
We will never let you leave.

30:30.629 --> 30:32.529
(Loud rumbling)

30:34.333 --> 30:37.601
-Alex!
-I got you. I got you.

30:40.906 --> 30:43.106
-(Gasps)
-James: Alex, thank god.

30:43.108 --> 30:44.942
(Alex panting)

30:49.248 --> 30:50.614
You pulled me out?

30:52.284 --> 30:53.684
How could you?

30:53.686 --> 30:55.652
I told you to stop him!

30:55.654 --> 30:57.554
-I did.
-She was about to choose us!

30:57.556 --> 30:59.690
-She was about to come home!
-Alex...

30:59.692 --> 31:01.558
-Why did you pull me out?
-Alex!

31:01.560 --> 31:03.627
-Why?
-I didn't!

31:03.629 --> 31:04.962
Then how did I come back?

31:04.964 --> 31:07.464
Because you did it.
You did it. You did it.

31:07.466 --> 31:08.765
You convinced her.

31:08.767 --> 31:09.833
Hey.

31:11.570 --> 31:13.737
(Squelching)

31:18.110 --> 31:19.176
Winn: Hey.

31:19.178 --> 31:20.544
Hey. Kara.

31:20.546 --> 31:21.778
It's okay, wait,
wait. It's okay.

31:21.780 --> 31:23.881
Hey, hey, we're here.
We're here.

31:23.883 --> 31:26.550
Hey, we're here.
We're here. I got you.

31:29.054 --> 31:30.120
You okay?

31:32.057 --> 31:34.558
That was one
messed up daffodil.

31:39.131 --> 31:40.530
Kara, are you okay?

32:03.188 --> 32:04.554
Who did this to me?

32:06.025 --> 32:07.624
Non.

32:07.626 --> 32:08.892
Where is he?

32:13.832 --> 32:15.499
The Kryptonians used
the black mercy

32:15.501 --> 32:18.302
and the solar storms
to distract us
from their next move.

32:18.304 --> 32:21.204
Agent vasquez tells me
you have a working theory
on what that might be.

32:21.206 --> 32:22.539
Um, like I said before,

32:22.541 --> 32:24.641
I thought it would have
something to do
with satellites.

32:24.643 --> 32:27.744
And since I spend
most of my day
looking at satellite signals,

32:27.746 --> 32:29.513
I decided to analyze them
with your computers

32:29.515 --> 32:32.716
which, by the way,
if you're ever having,
like, a fire sale,

32:32.718 --> 32:34.718
you just let me know.
(Chuckles)

32:35.087 --> 32:36.420
Ahem.

32:36.422 --> 32:38.422
Um...

32:38.424 --> 32:41.525
Anyways, I found some
hidden transmissions
buried in the c-band spectrum.

32:41.527 --> 32:44.194
-What's the connection?
-Uh, well, funny
you should ask.

32:45.664 --> 32:47.497
They all use
lord tech servers,

32:47.499 --> 32:50.200
which happen to be
based at the same lab
non's troops attacked.

32:50.202 --> 32:51.969
Now you know
why he hit my facility.

32:51.971 --> 32:54.938
He's using your tech to
override the civilian network.

32:54.940 --> 32:57.674
Non didn't take anything,
he left something behind.

32:58.177 --> 32:59.509
A virus.

32:59.511 --> 33:00.978
-A virus that does what?
-I don't know.

33:00.980 --> 33:02.245
But I don't want to
wait around to find out.

33:02.247 --> 33:03.914
How do we find them?

33:03.916 --> 33:05.983
My company handles
six other satellite farms
in the city limits.

33:05.985 --> 33:07.250
They have to be
the next target.

33:07.252 --> 33:08.719
Scramble our teams
to each location.

33:08.721 --> 33:10.721
Non is mine.

33:22.501 --> 33:24.301
(Helicopter blades whirring)

33:32.378 --> 33:33.710
(Beeping)

33:36.482 --> 33:38.315
(Supergirl grunting)

33:40.753 --> 33:43.320
Do you have any idea
what you did to me?

33:44.123 --> 33:47.657
You made me lose them again!

33:47.659 --> 33:52.162
(Grunts) My parents!
My whole world!

33:53.098 --> 33:55.232
(Grunting)

33:55.234 --> 33:57.167
-(Groaning)
-And you think

33:57.169 --> 34:00.604
that I'm gonna let
you take this world
away from me, too?

34:00.606 --> 34:03.640
You think I'm gonna
let you hurt them
like you hurt me?

34:03.642 --> 34:04.941
Never!

34:06.412 --> 34:08.078
(Grunting)

34:13.652 --> 34:14.918
Stay back!

34:20.759 --> 34:22.459
(Shots firing)

34:28.300 --> 34:30.567
I don't want to
fight you, astra.

34:30.569 --> 34:34.137
I helped save my niece
out of a sense of duty,
which does not extend to you.

34:34.139 --> 34:36.273
That's not why you helped her.

34:36.275 --> 34:37.641
You love her.

34:37.643 --> 34:39.976
That's how I know your heart
isn't in this war anymore.

34:41.580 --> 34:43.113
You know nothing of me.

34:43.115 --> 34:46.316
I know that you've had plenty
of chances to kill me.

34:46.318 --> 34:47.918
And to kill Kara.

34:48.520 --> 34:49.920
But you haven't.

34:50.722 --> 34:52.589
Because you don't want to.

34:52.591 --> 34:55.392
(Panting) Give it up, astra.

34:57.062 --> 34:58.228
Help us.

35:02.601 --> 35:03.867
Kara...

35:05.737 --> 35:07.504
I thought all your
kind were dead.

35:07.506 --> 35:08.905
I am the last.

35:08.907 --> 35:10.440
Earth is my home now.

35:10.442 --> 35:12.809
And I will not let you
take it from me.

35:14.746 --> 35:16.179
(Astra grunting)

35:21.220 --> 35:23.286
You stupid girl.

35:23.288 --> 35:25.155
Have you any idea
what you're doing?

35:25.157 --> 35:27.324
Yes, I'm stopping you.

35:27.326 --> 35:31.328
Your mother believed
she could, but she failed.

35:32.097 --> 35:33.230
I won't.

35:33.232 --> 35:34.297
(Grunts)

35:36.602 --> 35:38.735
Because I've known pain.

35:38.737 --> 35:40.370
But I've also known love.

35:40.372 --> 35:42.572
And the people
here are my family.

35:42.574 --> 35:45.242
I may have been
born on Krypton,
but I choose earth.

35:45.244 --> 35:48.378
And I will protect it
until my last breath.

35:48.380 --> 35:50.080
(Both grunting)

35:52.451 --> 35:56.786
You have the hubris of
the great house of El,

35:56.788 --> 35:59.222
which blinds you to the truth.

36:00.459 --> 36:02.626
Humanity is a disease.

36:02.628 --> 36:04.594
Myriad is the cure.

36:06.899 --> 36:08.165
(Grunts)

36:10.602 --> 36:12.169
(Beeping)

36:16.808 --> 36:18.575
(Astra grunting)

36:29.988 --> 36:31.488
Fear not, martian.

36:31.490 --> 36:33.290
You will die
a soldier's death.

36:43.268 --> 36:44.901
(Gasping)

36:57.049 --> 37:00.317
Non: You are getting
better, Kara Zor-El.

37:00.319 --> 37:02.519
But I will not be dying today.

37:19.705 --> 37:21.705
Alex: <i> Kara, get over here now.</i>

37:21.707 --> 37:23.073
<i> It's astra.</i>

37:29.014 --> 37:30.280
What happened?

37:33.652 --> 37:35.018
There was a fight.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.389
I killed her.

37:39.391 --> 37:41.391
I'm sorry, but I could
see no other way.

37:45.664 --> 37:47.163
Kara, she doesn't have long.

37:50.869 --> 37:53.169
Astra: Hello, little one.

37:53.171 --> 37:55.772
(Gasping for breath)
I'm so happy to see

37:55.774 --> 37:57.207
your sister

37:57.209 --> 37:59.009
was able to bring you back.

38:01.847 --> 38:04.080
Astra, I have to tell you,

38:04.082 --> 38:06.516
when I was under
the black mercy,

38:08.120 --> 38:09.519
you were there.

38:10.155 --> 38:11.721
As your enemy.

38:14.626 --> 38:16.126
(Sobbing) As my family.

38:17.562 --> 38:18.628
Kara...

38:20.198 --> 38:22.065
Kara, listen to me.

38:22.067 --> 38:24.301
Non cannot be stopped.

38:25.971 --> 38:28.138
If you stand in his way,

38:28.140 --> 38:30.740
he will kill you

38:30.742 --> 38:32.008
and those you love.

38:32.010 --> 38:35.445
He said something
about, um, myriad.

38:35.447 --> 38:38.882
Tell me, tell me
what it is before
it's too late. Please.

38:38.884 --> 38:41.618
It already is,

38:41.620 --> 38:42.686
little one.

38:50.162 --> 38:52.162
(Supergirl crying)

38:58.670 --> 38:59.736
Alex: Kara...

39:00.572 --> 39:01.738
Kara, we have to go.

39:02.374 --> 39:04.574
-Now. Now!
-Go!

39:30.035 --> 39:32.502
I promise you.

39:32.504 --> 39:34.404
She died a hero.

39:34.406 --> 39:36.072
And myriad is operational.

39:36.074 --> 39:37.841
Our general did
not die in vain.

39:41.747 --> 39:43.079
Courtesy of Supergirl.

39:44.049 --> 39:45.582
Get this to the lab.

39:45.584 --> 39:47.617
I want to know everything
there is to know about it.

39:58.764 --> 40:01.765
(Sighs) Beta and delta
squadrons never
reported in.

40:01.767 --> 40:04.934
I'm guessing after
what happened to astra,
they never will.

40:04.936 --> 40:06.836
This isn't your fault, Alex.

40:06.838 --> 40:08.171
Astra was a righteous kill.

40:08.173 --> 40:09.639
That doesn't make
this any easier.

40:09.641 --> 40:11.741
You made the hard choice.
It's what soldiers do.

40:13.011 --> 40:14.744
How is your sister holding up?

40:14.746 --> 40:17.680
Astra may have been Kara's
enemy on the battlefield,

40:17.682 --> 40:20.450
but she was also family.

40:20.452 --> 40:23.720
-She's taking it hard.
-Yeah, I knew she would.

40:23.722 --> 40:26.456
She never stopped believing
astra could be saved.

40:26.458 --> 40:28.725
That's the difference
between soldiers and heroes.

40:30.429 --> 40:31.494
Sir.

40:34.099 --> 40:35.832
Why did you lie to Kara?

40:43.408 --> 40:45.442
Because you're
Supergirl's hero.

40:46.578 --> 40:47.944
And I don't want her
to see you

40:47.946 --> 40:49.679
as anything other than that.

41:07.232 --> 41:10.500
Oh, you guys,
you did not have to do this.

41:10.502 --> 41:11.601
Winn: Like, seriously,
we didn't?

41:11.603 --> 41:13.236
I thought this was mandatory.

41:13.238 --> 41:15.171
(All laugh)

41:16.007 --> 41:17.440
Hey, um...

41:18.577 --> 41:20.743
We need to talk about that

41:20.745 --> 41:22.512
"perfect fantasy world"
i was in...

41:22.514 --> 41:24.080
Kara, we don't
need to discuss...

41:24.082 --> 41:27.450
I want to tell you guys
why I imagined myself
on Krypton.

41:29.988 --> 41:31.654
It's not because
i hate it here.

41:31.656 --> 41:34.891
It's because the past
few weeks I've

41:34.893 --> 41:37.794
been feeling lost and...

41:37.796 --> 41:41.064
Like I did when
i first came to earth.

41:41.066 --> 41:44.534
So I started fantasizing
about the same things
i used to back then.

41:46.705 --> 41:49.873
I chose to come back
because I realized

41:51.276 --> 41:53.409
I belong here with you.

41:54.112 --> 41:55.545
My family.

41:56.448 --> 41:58.281
I guess it's true.

41:58.283 --> 42:00.116
There's no place like home.

42:00.118 --> 42:01.451
-(Chuckling)
-James: Aw.

42:01.453 --> 42:03.186
That's right.
You just quoted a movie.

42:03.188 --> 42:06.689
Danvers, this is
like a whole new level
in our friendship here.

42:10.161 --> 42:12.295
'Cause we are friends.

42:12.297 --> 42:14.297
Yeah. Yeah, the best.

42:14.299 --> 42:15.832
-Alex: Aw...
-Give it up.

42:15.834 --> 42:18.434
Well, I didn't know if it was
a pot sticker night...

42:18.436 --> 42:20.637
-(Gasping)
-(Papers rustling)

42:20.639 --> 42:23.206
...or ice cream.

42:23.208 --> 42:26.042
So, guess what? I got both.

42:26.044 --> 42:28.645
-They're my favorite!
-I know. I know what you like.

42:31.116 --> 42:33.683
Alex: Kara, there's, um...

42:33.685 --> 42:35.852
There's something
that you should know.

42:36.454 --> 42:37.954
Yeah, sure. What is it?

42:42.160 --> 42:46.195
Hank tried to cover for you
at work while you were gone.

42:46.197 --> 42:48.197
Kara: Whoa... (Exhales)

42:48.199 --> 42:51.301
I'm guessing that
did not go well.

42:51.303 --> 42:52.569
Well, that would be
a solid guess.

42:52.571 --> 42:54.704
Winn: Oh, no.
Not by any metric. No.

42:54.706 --> 42:57.574
(Splutters) Let's take
the catco talk for tomorrow.

42:57.576 --> 43:00.343
Okay? It's time to eat.
And plus...

43:00.345 --> 43:02.178
I got a little bit of this.

43:02.180 --> 43:05.014
-Yes!
-Kara: That's no fun.
You know I can't get drunk.

43:05.016 --> 43:07.483
-It is fun be 'cause we can.
-Alex: Uh, and we will.

43:07.485 --> 43:09.686
(All talking simultaneously)
