02:53.300 --> 02:54.733
All right, so Marilyn

02:54.767 --> 02:57.667
can you tell me
about Aaron as a child?

02:57.700 --> 03:01.200
As a child, he stood out

03:01.233 --> 03:02.267
from the other kids,

03:02.300 --> 03:05.267
he saw things differently

03:05.300 --> 03:08.133
and had a real gifted--

03:08.167 --> 03:11.167
well, he was very gifted.

03:11.200 --> 03:13.367
He liked art.

03:13.400 --> 03:17.100
And he...

03:17.133 --> 03:18.433
spoke early.

03:18.467 --> 03:20.167
And he noticed things

03:20.200 --> 03:22.767
I think quicker...

03:22.800 --> 03:24.500
than kids his age.

03:24.533 --> 03:27.767
And you still care about art?

03:27.800 --> 03:30.533
Sure.

03:30.567 --> 03:33.633
What-- why do
you say it like that?

03:33.667 --> 03:35.367
I'm not like
an artist, you know?

03:35.400 --> 03:36.633
I'm like-- I'm like a--

03:36.667 --> 03:40.033
I'm not really
making art right now,

03:40.067 --> 03:42.433
so, you know, it's not a-- yeah.

03:42.467 --> 03:46.167
It's not like a big, you know...

03:46.200 --> 03:47.367
thing.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.733
But you don't stop
being an artist.

04:11.200 --> 04:12.500
Eva, stay!

04:13.833 --> 04:15.400
Stay!

04:17.132 --> 04:19.433
Come on.

04:50.367 --> 04:51.467
Give me a kiss.

04:52.733 --> 04:54.400
We're gonna go inside.

04:58.200 --> 05:00.167
Hey, that Eddie truck!

05:00.200 --> 05:01.267
It is.

05:03.067 --> 05:04.133
Yeah?

05:06.467 --> 05:08.467
Whoa, and I got this!

05:12.733 --> 05:14.467
Hey, boy.

05:16.433 --> 05:18.133
Hey.

05:45.233 --> 05:47.267
Tennis ball.

05:47.300 --> 05:49.133
All right, come on.

05:49.167 --> 05:50.467
Mommy has to go to work.

05:50.500 --> 05:51.800
We're gonna take you
to Grandma's,

05:51.833 --> 05:53.133
- come on.
- To Nana's?

05:53.167 --> 05:54.133
Yup.

05:55.767 --> 05:56.800
I can't do this.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.433
Hey, guys!
Welcome back to my channel.

06:15.467 --> 06:18.233
Thanks so much for being here
and hanging out with me today.

06:18.267 --> 06:20.233
I have done
so many vlogs lately

06:20.267 --> 06:24.067
and you guys give me the best,
like, love.

06:24.100 --> 06:26.233
I have no plans

06:26.267 --> 06:28.567
on competing right now or ever,

06:28.600 --> 06:30.233
I'm not really sure.

06:30.267 --> 06:32.500
It's an idea that I've rolled
around in my head

06:32.533 --> 06:35.433
and been curious about
because I have so many friends

06:35.467 --> 06:38.300
who do compete
and they look like they have

06:38.333 --> 06:40.467
just so much fun doing it.

06:40.500 --> 06:43.067
But they also have

06:43.100 --> 06:46.133
those really tough days
that look like hell.

06:46.167 --> 06:49.533
So, I'm kind of iffy on it.

06:49.567 --> 06:51.533
I think the only reason
I would compete

06:51.567 --> 06:54.133
is just to prove to myself
that I can do it.

06:54.167 --> 06:55.800
And that I could dedicate myself

06:55.833 --> 06:59.733
to something
so structured and strict.

06:59.767 --> 07:02.567
But, yeah, that would be
one of the main reasons.

07:59.800 --> 08:02.233
For the jury,
the video is a brief look

08:02.267 --> 08:03.800
inside the mind
of the alleged killer

08:03.833 --> 08:05.733
taken during a mental evaluation

08:05.767 --> 08:07.333
to help determine whether Holmes

08:07.367 --> 08:10.133
was legally insane
when he opened fire

08:10.167 --> 08:12.200
in a Colorado movie theater.

08:12.233 --> 08:14.267
Ordered by the court,
Dr. William Reed

08:14.300 --> 08:16.133
interviewed Holmes nine times

08:16.167 --> 08:18.667
for a total of twenty-two hours.

08:18.700 --> 08:20.600
Did you think
about hurting yourself

08:20.633 --> 08:22.200
or killing yourself?

08:22.233 --> 08:24.267
No.

08:24.300 --> 08:26.600
How about hurting
or killing other people?

08:26.633 --> 08:30.200
Yeah,
I can't kind of sleep, so--

08:30.233 --> 08:32.167
and I'm homicidal.

09:44.700 --> 09:46.667
Bryce?

11:02.633 --> 11:04.600
So we are in agreement
on this now?

11:04.633 --> 11:07.400
Because this is the last
gentle warning I can give you.

11:09.767 --> 11:12.067
- Are we in agreement on this?
- Yes.

11:12.100 --> 11:13.367
All right.

13:47.200 --> 13:48.733
I get a ton of questions

13:48.767 --> 13:51.800
in Instagram polls,
Twitter, Facebook.

13:51.833 --> 13:53.800
And, you know,
and a lot of them,

13:53.833 --> 13:55.400
they had the same questions.

14:01.633 --> 14:03.133
my friend's videos

14:03.167 --> 14:05.267
when they ask specific questions

14:05.300 --> 14:08.233
and then they

14:16.233 --> 14:17.733
So, I'm gonna go
read your questions

14:17.767 --> 14:19.367
and answer them.

14:19.400 --> 14:22.433
So the first question
on Instagram is,

14:22.467 --> 14:25.400
would you consider your vlog
as

14:32.333 --> 14:35.267
a lot of work to do,
a lot of

14:52.067 --> 14:53.433
and, yeah,

14:53.467 --> 14:56.233
so I'm

14:56.267 --> 14:59.200
every day that

15:03.767 --> 15:06.133
so yeah, I'm definitely
considering it,

15:06.167 --> 15:09.100
see if I want
to do it

15:51.533 --> 15:53.367
I don't like being
around other people,

15:53.400 --> 15:57.367
it's-- and I have confined
myself to my house.

15:57.400 --> 15:59.567
God, for a long time now.

15:59.600 --> 16:01.567
And how do you manage?

16:01.600 --> 16:03.433
Like, who gets groceries?

16:03.467 --> 16:05.100
I do, but I have to go

16:05.133 --> 16:06.400
at like 2:00, 3:00

16:06.433 --> 16:08.300
in the morning
to Walmart or somethin'.

16:08.333 --> 16:10.700
The hardest the thing
for me was actually coming back

16:10.733 --> 16:12.567
and learning
how to be a family member.

16:12.600 --> 16:14.067
You've got a five-year old son

16:14.100 --> 16:16.100
who can't--
I'm like, "Stop, now!"

16:16.133 --> 16:18.367
And my wife's like,
"You can't yell at him."

16:18.400 --> 16:20.167
"You can't grab him."
I'm like, "Ah!"

16:20.200 --> 16:22.600
Or, "Look, he can't cry."

16:22.633 --> 16:24.433
Over in Iraq,
the friends I lost there,

16:24.467 --> 16:25.633
that sucked, it was horrible,

16:25.667 --> 16:27.500
but you have a way
to-- you got--

16:27.533 --> 16:29.533
you gotta do your job
so you kind of...

16:29.567 --> 16:31.800
- Right, it's expected, I mean--
- And it's expected, yeah.

16:31.833 --> 16:33.467
You know not everybody's
gonna come home.

16:33.500 --> 16:35.333
But then you come home
and you're goin',

16:35.367 --> 16:36.800
", man,
they're still fallin'."

16:36.833 --> 16:38.067
- Yeah.
- "You know,

16:38.100 --> 16:39.333
what is going on here?"

16:48.167 --> 16:50.067
It's okay, calm down.

17:04.099 --> 17:06.032
There-- I knew
there's always gonna be people

17:06.067 --> 17:07.500
that are just
not gonna like you.

17:07.532 --> 17:09.367
You know? They're not--
they're gonna call you

17:09.400 --> 17:10.567
an behind your back

17:10.599 --> 17:12.233
and you're never
gonna hear about it.

17:12.267 --> 17:13.633
You know?

17:13.666 --> 17:15.767
Unless it's like your--
like your best friend.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.166
And--

17:17.200 --> 17:18.633
Do you have a best friend?

17:18.666 --> 17:20.500
Yeah, over the--
over the internet.

17:20.532 --> 17:21.633
And that's about it.

17:21.666 --> 17:23.500
Because I-- we fight a lot,

17:23.532 --> 17:25.567
we fight so much
but it doesn't matter,

17:25.599 --> 17:27.433
- 'cause you know?
- Is it someone

17:27.467 --> 17:29.100
who you've met
before in real life

17:29.133 --> 17:30.567
- or just someone you know?
- Just someone

17:30.600 --> 17:32.233
I started playing
with on the internet

17:32.267 --> 17:33.367
and we just never stopped

17:33.400 --> 17:34.700
talking to each other.

17:34.733 --> 17:37.000
- That's good.
- Yeah.

17:38.400 --> 17:40.433
No, I-- no, I get--
I get what you're--

17:40.467 --> 17:42.167
what you're saying.

17:42.200 --> 17:43.633
A long time-- a while ago,

17:43.667 --> 17:45.700
while I was in middle school,
I remember, like,

17:45.733 --> 17:47.800
what the teachers
were saying was,

17:47.833 --> 17:49.667
what kids don't understand
is that when you--

17:49.700 --> 17:51.333
when you shoot someone
in real life

17:51.367 --> 17:53.400
they don't, you know,
get back up and respawn.

17:53.433 --> 17:55.067
And... I think
that was a little--

17:55.100 --> 17:56.533
that was a little harsh,
you know?

17:56.567 --> 17:58.800
That was a little, um...

17:58.833 --> 18:01.200
to just assume kids
thought like that.

18:01.233 --> 18:02.533
No, it-- I--

18:02.567 --> 18:06.067
kids can discern reality
from a video game.

18:06.100 --> 18:08.333
I think people make
those assumptions

18:08.367 --> 18:10.400
because, well, pretty much
they don't play video games.

18:10.433 --> 18:12.467
Well, yeah, what is violence?
Just, you know,

18:12.500 --> 18:13.533
the act of aggression

18:13.567 --> 18:15.533
or the act...

18:15.567 --> 18:17.200
of, you know,

18:17.233 --> 18:18.533
blood coming out
of someone's body?

18:18.567 --> 18:20.467
No, it's actually the opposite.

18:20.500 --> 18:23.400
The people playing
are actually...

18:23.433 --> 18:25.600
more immersed

18:25.633 --> 18:28.800
in what life isn't
than what it is.

18:28.833 --> 18:31.067
And that's pretty much
why people play video games.

18:31.100 --> 18:34.233
It's just to explore their mind,
explore reality,

18:34.267 --> 18:37.433
explore different possibilities.

18:37.467 --> 18:39.633
Not so much...

18:39.667 --> 18:43.100
to, you know,

18:43.133 --> 18:45.100
be warped
in some twisted reality

18:45.133 --> 18:48.267
where you get to kill people
over and over again.

22:14.300 --> 22:17.067
Hey,
turn to me a little bit, yeah.

22:17.100 --> 22:19.333
Come this way.

22:24.433 --> 22:26.700
I gotta get this side.

22:40.200 --> 22:42.033
Here you take this.

22:44.533 --> 22:46.167
I'll give you
a little head massage

22:46.200 --> 22:47.233
while I'm at it.

23:04.233 --> 23:08.033
He kept having to pee.
He peed on a tree

23:08.067 --> 23:09.633
out front
of my apartment complex.

23:09.667 --> 23:11.500
Hey, that's a boy's
thing, you know?

23:11.533 --> 23:12.767
We can--

23:12.800 --> 23:14.600
I don't even...

23:18.067 --> 23:19.367
This guy.

23:19.400 --> 23:21.033
Give me that actually.

23:21.067 --> 23:22.267
No, I asked first.

23:22.300 --> 23:23.700
Rock, paper, scissors. Go.

23:23.733 --> 23:25.367
Bro, it's all right,
see my wand.

23:25.400 --> 23:27.400
There two
for me to get up here?

23:27.433 --> 23:29.467
Because I thought
there was only one.

23:29.500 --> 23:32.433
There's my decent one and
then that one you have pushed in.

23:32.467 --> 23:34.267
You have to talk about it.

23:34.300 --> 23:37.033
Yeah, I'm gonna hit that once
and I've no doubt about it.

23:37.067 --> 23:38.133
I know Cheeba.

23:38.167 --> 23:39.267
Baby lungs! Baby lungs!

23:39.300 --> 23:40.733
Seem like...

23:40.767 --> 23:42.800
Yeah tastes--

23:42.833 --> 23:44.667
- Tastes like candlewax.
- It's on my hand.

23:44.700 --> 23:46.733
How do you know
what candlewax tastes like?

23:46.767 --> 23:48.600
Because you can smell it.

23:48.633 --> 23:51.067
Yeah, but that doesn't
mean you can taste it.

23:51.100 --> 23:52.100
It's your instincts.

27:10.833 --> 27:12.767
Jenna...

27:15.133 --> 27:16.767
Maggie...

27:19.200 --> 27:21.133
Lucas Fickle...

27:23.133 --> 27:24.633
Aaron.

27:24.667 --> 27:27.300
Luger...

27:27.333 --> 27:29.033
Tyrell...

27:30.667 --> 27:32.500
Tyjon...

29:17.567 --> 29:20.400
One, two, three, four, five,

29:20.433 --> 29:23.200
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

29:23.233 --> 29:26.467
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,

29:26.500 --> 29:28.533
17, 18, 19, 20,

29:28.567 --> 29:31.533
21, 22, 23, 24, 25,

29:31.567 --> 29:35.067
26, 27, 28, 29, 30,

29:35.100 --> 29:39.033
31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37,

29:39.067 --> 29:42.033
38, 40, 41.

30:18.200 --> 30:20.533
One, two, three, four, five,

30:20.567 --> 30:23.133
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

30:23.167 --> 30:25.267
11, 12, 13, 14,

30:25.300 --> 30:27.200
15, 16,

30:41.833 --> 30:43.767
Whoo!

31:14.467 --> 31:16.700
Do you know where
I can find the towels?

31:16.733 --> 31:18.167
Aisle Six.

31:18.200 --> 31:19.633
I didn't know you worked here,

31:19.667 --> 31:21.167
- Aisle Six?
- I do. Yeah.

31:21.200 --> 31:22.500
Excuse me, I'm looking

31:22.533 --> 31:24.567
for a Fourth of July shirt
for my husband

31:24.600 --> 31:26.433
can you direct me
to the Men's Section?

31:26.467 --> 31:29.767
Yeah, last table on your left.

31:29.800 --> 31:32.033
- Oh. Thank you.
- A few of us

31:32.067 --> 31:34.767
are going to the bay later,
if you want to come.

31:34.800 --> 31:37.067
Sure.

34:01.067 --> 34:03.067
Oh, man.

35:15.400 --> 35:17.500
I think that-- it--

35:17.533 --> 35:19.567
is that what school is though?
Is that what--

35:19.600 --> 35:21.700
is school one on one
with a teacher?

35:21.733 --> 35:24.567
No, it's a bunch of kids
in a classroom

35:24.600 --> 35:27.233
and you basically ask
the smartest one, you know,

35:27.267 --> 35:29.767
how to do this
and they give you the answers

35:29.800 --> 35:31.767
and then, you know,
you get a B

35:31.800 --> 35:34.567
or an A on the test.
And you move on, you know?

35:34.600 --> 35:36.300
There's no connection
with a teacher.

35:36.333 --> 35:39.567
I don't-- that never--
that never happened.

35:39.600 --> 35:41.567
So, I don't--

35:41.600 --> 35:43.700
I don't-- I don't,
you know-- it--

35:45.400 --> 35:47.033
I don't see the-- I don't see

35:47.067 --> 35:49.433
why college would be that hard

35:49.467 --> 35:52.367
in that aspect.

35:52.400 --> 35:55.200
You said something about,
"You learn from the world."

35:55.233 --> 35:58.667
Is that about experience
or what is that about?

35:58.700 --> 36:01.133
It's about just--

36:01.167 --> 36:03.467
do you want to die--
live or die, you know?

36:03.500 --> 36:05.133
Is-- do you want to survive?

36:05.167 --> 36:07.467
Then, you will-- you will,
you know, eat this--

36:07.500 --> 36:09.333
not eat this berry
and eat this berry.

36:09.367 --> 36:11.733
You know, you will not eat
this mushroom and you will--

36:11.767 --> 36:13.800
you will sleep here,
you will not sleep there.

36:13.833 --> 36:15.733
You will not go to--
into that forest

36:15.767 --> 36:19.200
because there's plenty of snakes
that will bite and kill you.

36:19.233 --> 36:21.067
You will not, you know,
play with tigers,

36:21.100 --> 36:23.133
you will not, you know,
do these certain things

36:23.167 --> 36:25.200
that will literally kill you.

36:25.233 --> 36:27.667
And that's just--
it's all about--

36:27.700 --> 36:31.267
just one on one,
you and the environment.

36:31.300 --> 36:33.200
And the environment
is not a person,

36:33.233 --> 36:37.033
the environment is not a human
with a brain trying to--

36:37.067 --> 36:39.300
trying to,

36:39.333 --> 36:41.367
resonate their ideas
throughout the universe.

36:41.400 --> 36:43.767
It's the nature is true,

36:43.800 --> 36:45.433
nature is real.

36:45.467 --> 36:47.167
You know, humans are not real,

36:47.200 --> 36:50.100
Human-- humans are ethereal.

36:50.133 --> 36:52.767
Humans, think they're real.

36:52.800 --> 36:55.167
And it's just, you know,

36:55.200 --> 36:57.133
it's just a bunch of bullshit.

38:14.067 --> 38:15.467
Hey, Jumper.

38:17.533 --> 38:18.633
You okay?

38:18.667 --> 38:20.433
Yeah.

38:20.467 --> 38:23.767
I stopped by a couple times
and you weren't--

38:23.800 --> 38:26.167
you weren't around.

38:26.200 --> 38:28.033
Yeah, I moved.

38:28.067 --> 38:29.600
Been touring a lot, too, so...

38:31.200 --> 38:32.667
Where did you move?

38:34.533 --> 38:38.100
Hey,
I need to get online for a lesson.

38:38.133 --> 38:40.667
You can use my internet.

38:40.700 --> 38:43.467
Are you Saiga 12?

38:43.500 --> 38:45.133
Yeah.

38:45.167 --> 38:47.267
What's that, Saiga 12?

38:47.300 --> 38:49.133
It's a gun.

38:49.167 --> 38:50.600
Oh.

40:38.233 --> 40:39.667
Do you want to sing it?

40:39.700 --> 40:41.267
Yeah.

40:41.300 --> 40:44.600

45:12.200 --> 45:14.667
Hi.
Can I just ask who I'm speaking with?

45:18.600 --> 45:20.367
Hi, JoAnn.
I'm calling about Summer.

45:20.400 --> 45:22.333
She just-- she just wanted--

45:22.367 --> 45:24.767
she wanted to express
that it would be a total

45:24.800 --> 45:27.533
and complete dream
to work on this project.

45:27.567 --> 45:29.767
So, she's really excited

45:29.800 --> 45:32.000
for Susan's take on it.

45:34.333 --> 45:36.167
On-- I'm sorry the casting--

45:36.200 --> 45:37.500
the casting yesterday.

45:44.667 --> 45:48.233
Oh, Summer Young.

45:49.300 --> 45:50.333
It's just she's--

45:50.367 --> 45:52.333
it would be a total dream.

45:52.367 --> 45:54.600
It would be, like, I mean--

45:54.633 --> 45:56.333
this-- it's sort of,

45:56.367 --> 45:57.800
it would be such
an amazing opportunity

45:57.833 --> 46:00.267
and I just really want
to express

46:00.300 --> 46:02.067
that on Summer's behalf.

46:02.100 --> 46:04.267
If you could pass
that along to Susan.

46:10.533 --> 46:14.033
Oh, actually, we sent a tape in.

46:14.067 --> 46:15.533
If it's possible for Susan

46:15.567 --> 46:17.600
to actually see her in person

46:17.633 --> 46:20.033
that would be really amazing.

46:20.067 --> 46:23.433
She's actually
at a casting right now.

46:23.467 --> 46:25.333
She's-- it's actually a double--

46:25.367 --> 46:28.067
or I'm sorry,
a second call back.

46:28.100 --> 46:29.200
But...

46:33.100 --> 46:35.133
Sophia, you're such a bitch.

46:35.167 --> 46:37.533
But she's
available this afternoon.

46:37.567 --> 46:40.200
After maybe, I guess, 4:00 PM?

46:40.233 --> 46:41.667
Do you think that you might have

46:41.700 --> 46:44.433
anything available for
after 4:00 PM?

46:46.833 --> 46:49.767
Oh. Well, do you think
anything maybe tomorrow?

46:59.533 --> 47:03.333
Okay, yes. Yes, exactly.

47:03.367 --> 47:05.400
So, it would be in response
to the tape

47:05.433 --> 47:06.767
or if you just didn't even

47:06.800 --> 47:08.800
want to watch the tape
and you just wanted

47:08.833 --> 47:10.633
to have her come on in.

47:29.567 --> 47:32.067
What the

47:32.100 --> 47:34.433
Excuse me.

47:34.467 --> 47:37.767
Oh, my God.-

48:06.733 --> 48:08.733
I don't necessarily think,

48:10.533 --> 48:13.167
he would have given me,
you know, like a--

48:13.200 --> 48:14.433
like a positive structure

48:14.467 --> 48:17.267
or a person to look up to.

48:17.300 --> 48:19.633
I just think, maybe, you know,

48:19.667 --> 48:21.600
things would be different
about my personality

48:21.633 --> 48:24.300
and I'd have more self-esteem

48:24.333 --> 48:26.300
or integrity, you know?

48:26.333 --> 48:28.767
Do you agree with that, Marilyn?

48:28.800 --> 48:32.200
Aaron's his own person
and I think that,

48:32.233 --> 48:35.433
yes, it helps to have a father

48:35.467 --> 48:37.100
as a role model in your life,

48:37.133 --> 48:39.467
tremendously.

48:39.500 --> 48:41.133
You know, I think
probably would change--

48:41.167 --> 48:43.100
changed some things, but I think

48:43.133 --> 48:46.200
he's done pretty well

48:46.233 --> 48:49.467
growing up and making decisions.

48:49.500 --> 48:51.633
And...

48:51.667 --> 48:53.667
What are some of
the qualities that you--

48:53.700 --> 48:55.400
that you like about him?

48:55.433 --> 48:57.667
- That you think are--
- I think...

48:59.233 --> 49:01.100
his talents,

49:01.133 --> 49:03.367
that he's very talented.

49:03.400 --> 49:05.333
He...

49:07.400 --> 49:10.100
he's not been a problem

49:10.133 --> 49:11.800
with drinking, or drugs

49:11.833 --> 49:14.267
or crime, or anything.

49:14.300 --> 49:16.167
He's not even close to that.

49:16.200 --> 49:18.500
He's been very passive

49:18.533 --> 49:20.400
and very, you know, interested

49:20.433 --> 49:22.200
in the things he likes to do.

49:22.233 --> 49:24.400
And he's been a good son.

50:27.767 --> 50:30.167
I don't know
where they are, Robert.

50:34.133 --> 50:35.767
Is John home?

50:35.800 --> 50:37.367
He's overseas.

50:44.767 --> 50:48.433
Do you want money?
I could get my purse.

50:48.467 --> 50:49.500
Okay.

50:49.533 --> 50:50.600
Yeah.

54:39.367 --> 54:41.067
Is that your movie star face?

54:41.100 --> 54:42.567
I sure hope so.

54:50.133 --> 54:52.567
No, I didn't like Brookside.

54:52.600 --> 54:53.633
Why not?

54:53.667 --> 54:55.733
It sucked.

54:55.767 --> 54:57.400
You just didn't
like the teachers?

54:57.433 --> 54:59.167
Or the people there?

54:59.200 --> 55:01.267
No, it's just the kids there

55:01.300 --> 55:03.200
were constantly fighting me.

55:03.233 --> 55:04.367
Fighting you?

55:04.400 --> 55:06.733
- Yeah.
- Why?

55:06.767 --> 55:10.367
Because they're faggots

55:10.400 --> 55:12.400
can't control their anger.

55:14.467 --> 55:17.167
Yeah, it's all right,

55:17.200 --> 55:19.200
I don't-- I don't care,
it was middle school.

55:19.233 --> 55:22.200
But you don't want that
when you're growing up--

55:22.233 --> 55:25.700
you don't want to feel isolated
when you're--

55:25.733 --> 55:27.567
when-- you don't want
to feel like people

55:27.600 --> 55:29.233
are against you
when you're growing up.

55:29.267 --> 55:31.367
- Uh-hmm.
- Just it destroys

55:31.400 --> 55:33.300
your personality.

01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:13.533
Is that a tattoo on your eye?

01:00:13.567 --> 01:00:15.300
No, it's just makeup.

01:00:15.333 --> 01:00:17.733
- It looks cool.
- Thanks.

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:29.800
The most ungrateful
thing everybody's ever seen.

01:00:29.833 --> 01:00:32.100
It's too shallow. I think...

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.600
That's really hard
and shallow water.

01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:56.333
- Sorry.
- We're making it now.

01:00:56.367 --> 01:00:58.367
- I know.
- Exactly.

01:01:27.633 --> 01:01:31.533
I had it for three years.

01:01:31.567 --> 01:01:34.100
Neglected for three years
actually.

01:01:34.133 --> 01:01:35.767
And I was fine.

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:38.700
When he did give me
the antibiotics,

01:01:38.733 --> 01:01:39.667
it was changing.

01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:40.800
The color of the breast,

01:01:40.833 --> 01:01:42.433
the nipple was coming back out.

01:01:42.467 --> 01:01:44.700
- So, you know, it--
- So they thought

01:01:44.733 --> 01:01:47.133
it was just the infection
that it was healing itself

01:01:47.167 --> 01:01:48.433
and that you were young enough.

01:01:48.467 --> 01:01:49.733
So they needed to find out

01:01:49.767 --> 01:01:51.400
if they needed to take it out.

01:01:51.433 --> 01:01:53.433
So that's when I went
to do the biopsy.

01:01:53.467 --> 01:01:55.300
And when the biopsy results
came back

01:01:55.333 --> 01:01:57.067
it showed that I have
breast cancer.

01:01:57.100 --> 01:01:59.300
No blood.

01:01:59.333 --> 01:02:01.267
Outside-- it was all in here.

01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:02.600
Internal bleeding.

01:02:02.633 --> 01:02:05.367
And I had a subdural hematoma

01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:08.300
and two days later,
my brain hemorrhaged

01:02:08.333 --> 01:02:09.733
and shifted on the axis

01:02:09.767 --> 01:02:13.400
and they went in
to suction the blood out

01:02:13.433 --> 01:02:15.067
and found it had
hemorrhaged so bad

01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:17.133
that they had to remove

01:02:17.167 --> 01:02:18.533
part of my right temporal lobe

01:02:18.567 --> 01:02:21.033
and part of my frontal lobe.

01:02:50.467 --> 01:02:54.067
My whole life,

01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:56.700
and everything
I've been through,

01:02:56.733 --> 01:03:00.333
that I've drawn strength
from that.

01:03:01.467 --> 01:03:03.300
You know?

01:04:56.233 --> 01:04:57.500
The number of those shot

01:04:57.533 --> 01:04:58.667
is changing by the minute.

01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:00.500
Did you know that three people

01:05:00.533 --> 01:05:02.600
were pronounced dead on arrival
at the hospital

01:05:02.633 --> 01:05:04.500
including the shooter?

01:05:04.533 --> 01:05:07.033
Reporters say the shooter
then turned the gun on himself.

01:05:07.067 --> 01:05:09.200
Live now
from Lafayette, Louisiana

01:05:09.233 --> 01:05:10.800
in the press conference.

01:05:10.833 --> 01:05:12.300
Any relationship
between the shooter

01:05:12.333 --> 01:05:13.733
and the other victims?

01:05:13.767 --> 01:05:15.633
We don't know that yet.

01:05:15.667 --> 01:05:18.267
And we don't know
if this was just a random act

01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:21.367
or there was
a domestic situation.

01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:45.533
Do you still
have that sketchbook

01:06:45.567 --> 01:06:47.067
that you showed us before?

01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:49.800
- Yeah.
- Can you get it for us?

01:06:49.833 --> 01:06:52.733
I mean, yeah, I guess so.

01:06:54.567 --> 01:06:56.633
I haven't drawn
in a while on it, so...

01:06:56.667 --> 01:06:58.500
I remember liking
the pictures a lot.

01:06:58.533 --> 01:06:59.800
I would love to see them.

01:06:59.833 --> 01:07:01.067
Yep.

01:07:05.433 --> 01:07:07.200
What do you think?

01:07:07.233 --> 01:07:09.533
I'm learning a lot.

01:07:09.567 --> 01:07:11.400
I'm listening to him.

01:07:11.433 --> 01:07:14.467
It's painful for me sometimes.

01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:17.167
I don't think it's fair that--

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:18.633
because I think
that he's missed out

01:07:18.667 --> 01:07:22.367
on relationships his whole life.

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:25.433
And I think some of that...

01:07:27.567 --> 01:07:29.567
stems from maybe me

01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:32.100
being fearful too

01:07:32.133 --> 01:07:34.333
of letting him go, you know?

01:07:34.367 --> 01:07:36.667
And I have to--
I have to deal with it,

01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:38.600
I can't be in denial.

01:07:38.633 --> 01:07:40.233
And so, it's just all around

01:07:40.267 --> 01:07:43.033
not a very comfortable place
sometimes for me.

01:07:43.067 --> 01:07:45.067
What do you want me
to do with it?

01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:47.667
Just bring it over and
look at them with your mom.

01:07:51.767 --> 01:07:53.333
- Okay.
- There's a picture

01:07:53.367 --> 01:07:56.100
of a girl in there
that I liked.

01:07:56.133 --> 01:07:58.700
- You know--
- No, not-- no.

01:09:20.399 --> 01:09:21.767
Hey.

01:09:29.233 --> 01:09:32.200
No. No!

01:09:36.567 --> 01:09:39.399
Hey, come here.

01:09:39.433 --> 01:09:41.433
- You want to go to Eddie?
- Yeah.

01:09:41.466 --> 01:09:42.533
Yeah?

01:10:41.633 --> 01:10:43.400
Uh-hmm. Okay.

01:10:43.433 --> 01:10:44.467
Si.

01:10:58.633 --> 01:11:01.300
Okay. Uh-hmm. Bye.

01:11:08.267 --> 01:11:10.433
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:11:39.533 --> 01:11:42.233
Okay. Okay.

01:11:43.633 --> 01:11:45.600
Do you feel like you're dying?

01:11:45.633 --> 01:11:47.600
Do you feel like
you're about to die?

01:11:47.633 --> 01:11:50.267
That's the right feeling.

01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:53.600
Eight...

01:11:53.633 --> 01:11:55.533
nine.
Okay, you can do it.

01:11:55.567 --> 01:11:57.400
You can do it,
you can do it.

01:11:57.433 --> 01:12:00.300
You can do it.
Okay, ten.

01:12:00.333 --> 01:12:03.067
You can do it, you can do it,
you can do it.

01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:05.033
We're gonna go to 20.
Eleven.

01:12:05.067 --> 01:12:06.700
You can do it.
Keep the back straight.

01:12:06.733 --> 01:12:09.300
Okay, already to 12.

01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:12.733
Okay, 13.

01:12:12.767 --> 01:12:14.467
Okay, 14.

01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:15.567
Fifteen.

01:12:18.267 --> 01:12:20.333
Okay, 16.

01:12:23.133 --> 01:12:24.533
Okay, okay.

01:12:24.567 --> 01:12:26.100
Okay.

01:14:32.367 --> 01:14:34.100
Hey, Jumper.

01:14:34.133 --> 01:14:36.133
- Hey, Dan.
- Where's the party?

01:14:36.167 --> 01:14:37.600
It's at the movies.

01:15:33.533 --> 01:15:35.200
Oh, you scared me then.

01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:38.467
All right.

01:15:39.667 --> 01:15:41.367
All right, see you, bud.

01:16:19.533 --> 01:16:21.100
