00:12.512 --> 00:15.598
- Okay ladies,
this is the spot.

00:15.598 --> 00:16.683
- Thanks, Charlie.

00:16.683 --> 00:18.017
- This is so exciting.

00:18.017 --> 00:19.602
I can't believe I'm
actually doing this.

00:19.602 --> 00:21.771
Like a 400 year old shipwreck.

00:21.771 --> 00:24.232
- A 400 year old
Spanish shipwreck

00:24.232 --> 00:27.610
that's never been seen and
never been photographed.

00:27.610 --> 00:28.862
- Do you think there's
gold down there

00:28.862 --> 00:30.655
or is that just an old legend?

00:32.657 --> 00:34.951
- Please tell me I didn't
forget my extra battery.

00:34.951 --> 00:37.620
- Hey Alex, what do
you think dad would say

00:37.620 --> 00:40.331
if he knew I finally got
my dive certification?

00:40.331 --> 00:41.875
- I think he'd be really happy.

00:42.834 --> 00:44.294
Hey Charlie?
- Yo.

00:44.294 --> 00:45.879
- What is the visibility?

00:45.879 --> 00:46.796
- At least 80 feet.

00:46.796 --> 00:49.466
- Aha, that's what
I like to hear.

00:49.466 --> 00:50.675
These photos are
going to be perfect.

00:50.675 --> 00:53.553
- Oh, this is so exciting,
my first big dive.

00:53.553 --> 00:56.598
- I know and I'm glad
we're doing this together.

00:56.598 --> 00:58.600
- Oh yeah, it makes
me way less nervous.

00:58.600 --> 01:01.060
- Don't be nervous, you
just stick with me, okay?

01:01.060 --> 01:02.812
You're gonna do great.

01:02.812 --> 01:04.814
You're gonna love it down there.

01:04.814 --> 01:07.275
- Okay
girls, here we go.

01:07.275 --> 01:08.151
- You ready?

01:27.796 --> 01:29.672
- These are gorgeous, Alex.

01:30.423 --> 01:32.258
The composition, perfect.

01:32.258 --> 01:33.134
- Thank you.

01:33.134 --> 01:34.552
- The sense of
detail, exquisite.

01:34.552 --> 01:35.386
- Thank you.

01:35.386 --> 01:36.471
- The lighting's
like a painting.

01:36.471 --> 01:37.931
- I don't know what
else to say, Sharon.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.140
It is some of my best work.

01:39.140 --> 01:40.475
- But they're two days late.

01:40.475 --> 01:43.436
- I know, but I just wanted
the photos to be perfect.

01:43.436 --> 01:45.396
- I had to use Ben's
Swiss orchard shots.

01:45.396 --> 01:46.397
- What?
- And you know I didn't want

01:46.397 --> 01:48.650
to use Ben's Swiss
orchard shots.

01:48.650 --> 01:49.776
Do you know what
your problem is?

01:49.776 --> 01:51.778
- No, but I'm sure
you're gonna tell me.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.655
- You're too much
of a perfectionist.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.657
- I happen to think
that perfectionism

01:55.657 --> 01:57.283
is an admirable quality.

01:57.283 --> 01:59.452
- What did I say last week?

01:59.452 --> 02:02.121
- You said that this
shoot could be my ticket

02:02.121 --> 02:03.331
to the Creative
Director position.

02:03.331 --> 02:04.123
- That's right.

02:04.123 --> 02:05.458
You have a lot of great ideas

02:05.458 --> 02:07.585
about the types of
stories we should do.

02:07.585 --> 02:10.505
And I know you're dying
for more creative control.

02:10.505 --> 02:12.632
But how can I trust you
to put an issue together

02:12.632 --> 02:15.051
when you miss your
own deadlines?

02:16.135 --> 02:17.262
Do you know what this is?

02:17.262 --> 02:18.721
- A list of all the
deadlines I've missed?

02:18.721 --> 02:20.723
- Funny.

02:20.723 --> 02:22.600
It's Ben Watson's resume.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.811
He wants to be
Creative Director, too.

02:24.811 --> 02:25.728
- Ben Watson?

02:25.728 --> 02:27.772
Oh come on, Sharon,
you even told me

02:27.772 --> 02:29.649
I had a better eye than Ben.

02:29.649 --> 02:30.817
And plus, most of his photos

02:30.817 --> 02:32.652
don't even make it
to the magazine.

02:33.570 --> 02:35.321
Except for those
apple tree shots.

02:35.321 --> 02:37.574
- Do you know what he
has, that you don't?

02:37.574 --> 02:39.701
Organization and discipline.

02:39.701 --> 02:41.369
- Sharon,
the meeting's starting.

02:41.369 --> 02:42.620
- I'll be right there.

02:43.329 --> 02:45.290
Now if you'll excuse me.

02:45.290 --> 02:48.084
The cover story for our
30th anniversary issue

02:48.084 --> 02:51.170
fell through and I have to
figure something out fast.

02:51.170 --> 02:53.840
I'm thinking 30 of
the best scenic views

02:53.840 --> 02:55.675
or something like that.

02:55.675 --> 02:57.302
I don't know, it'll come to me.

03:16.195 --> 03:19.032
- There, look how
organized I am.

03:28.374 --> 03:29.417
Huh, pearls.

03:32.712 --> 03:35.298
Legend of the Blue
Polynesian Pearl.

03:38.259 --> 03:39.260
- Hey Alex.

03:40.845 --> 03:42.555
- Ben, hey.

03:44.641 --> 03:47.644
Congratulations on your
shots making the cover.

03:47.644 --> 03:48.603
- Thanks.

03:48.603 --> 03:49.896
- Yeah, it was great.

03:52.565 --> 03:53.733
Can I help you?

03:53.733 --> 03:56.569
Just like I'm busy here.

03:56.569 --> 03:58.196
- Did Sharon tell you
the idea I pitched

03:58.196 --> 03:59.656
for the anniversary issue?

03:59.656 --> 04:00.740
- Nope.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.326
- Chan Dan Ya.

04:03.326 --> 04:04.535
- What's that?

04:04.535 --> 04:06.871
- It's a cliff in China
that spits out a stone egg

04:06.871 --> 04:08.581
once every 30 years.

04:09.415 --> 04:12.001
Perfect for the 30th
anniversary, don't you think?

04:14.671 --> 04:15.713
- Ah...

04:15.713 --> 04:16.798
Hello?

04:17.799 --> 04:18.716
That's my sister.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.806
Yeah, how are you?

04:24.806 --> 04:25.682
Renee, I...

04:27.642 --> 04:29.560
Tourists began flocking to Fiji

04:29.560 --> 04:31.437
to find the pearl
after the release

04:31.437 --> 04:33.815
of the bestselling
book Pearl in Paradise.

04:33.815 --> 04:35.441
Although it has
never been found,

04:35.441 --> 04:37.485
locals believe the
rare pearl is buried

04:37.485 --> 04:41.489
somewhere in the
rainforests of Viti Levu.

04:44.909 --> 04:45.618
Huh?

04:58.298 --> 04:59.465
- When's the next book
coming out, Colin?

04:59.465 --> 05:01.009
If you don't mind me asking.

05:01.009 --> 05:02.135
- Why thank you, Molly.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.970
You know I just turned
in the final draft

05:03.970 --> 05:05.930
to the editor, so with
editor notes and all that,

05:05.930 --> 05:07.890
mid, probably February.

05:07.890 --> 05:09.100
- Did you decide on a title?

05:09.100 --> 05:10.101
- I did.

05:11.310 --> 05:15.606
Treasures in Taipei, but
shh, don't tell anybody.

05:15.606 --> 05:17.275
- Blake Montoya
goes to Asia, huh?

05:17.275 --> 05:18.443
Cool.

05:18.443 --> 05:20.987
You've probably been there
a million times anyway.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.697
Usual raspberry scone and jam?

05:22.697 --> 05:24.073
- Yeah, you know what,
I'm gonna wait though

05:24.073 --> 05:24.949
until my agent gets here.

05:24.949 --> 05:26.534
She should be here any minute.

05:27.410 --> 05:28.286
Thank you, Molly.

05:31.581 --> 05:33.875
- Colin Page, nice to meet you.

05:34.959 --> 05:36.044
- Who are you?

05:36.044 --> 05:37.587
- Rita didn't tell you?

05:37.587 --> 05:39.881
I'm Derek Foster and I'm
gonna be working closely

05:39.881 --> 05:41.299
with you from now on.

05:44.010 --> 05:46.220
- Rita's been my
agent for 10 years

05:46.220 --> 05:48.848
and now I'm getting passed
off to a junior agent?

05:48.848 --> 05:51.350
- No, she'll remained involved.

05:51.350 --> 05:53.186
It'll just allow her to
focus on a few clients

05:53.186 --> 05:54.687
that need more
attention right now.

05:54.687 --> 05:57.106
Trust me, though,
you're in good hands.

05:57.106 --> 05:58.357
- Sir,
what can I get you?

05:58.357 --> 05:59.484
- What are you drinking?

05:59.484 --> 06:02.278
- It's an organic Ceylon
tea from Sri Lanka.

06:03.780 --> 06:04.781
- He brings his own.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.991
- Just a regular
coffee, two Splendas.

06:07.825 --> 06:10.703
I'm not gonna lie to you,
I'm a really big fan.

06:10.703 --> 06:11.871
- Really?

06:11.871 --> 06:13.039
- Yeah.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.041
You've got a couple really
remarkable successes.

06:15.041 --> 06:18.377
Pearl in Paradise sold 23,000
copies in its first week.

06:18.377 --> 06:20.046
It's impressive.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.547
Impressive for eight years ago.

06:22.673 --> 06:24.884
- Okay, eight years ago
you were in high school.

06:24.884 --> 06:26.385
- I'm wise beyond my years.

06:26.385 --> 06:27.845
Let's talk facts,
you're last three books

06:27.845 --> 06:29.597
have tapered off dramatically.

06:30.389 --> 06:31.641
- I wouldn't say dramatically.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.893
- The sales report, the
last two barely sold enough

06:33.893 --> 06:35.394
to stay on the shelves.

06:35.394 --> 06:36.479
Online was even worse.

06:36.479 --> 06:39.899
Diamonds in Dubai
made 2,000 downloads.

06:40.733 --> 06:42.235
What's going on C. P.?

06:42.235 --> 06:43.069
Talk to me.

06:43.069 --> 06:45.154
- What are you my therapist now?

06:45.154 --> 06:47.573
- Look, I read your manuscript
for Treasures in Taipei.

06:47.573 --> 06:49.951
And I can see why the
publisher's rejecting it.

06:49.951 --> 06:52.120
- What, they rejected it?

06:52.120 --> 06:54.413
- Editor thought it
was a greatest hits

06:54.413 --> 06:55.206
of all your old stuff.

06:55.206 --> 06:56.249
Same ole, same ole.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.583
She wants new.

06:57.583 --> 06:59.168
She wants fresh and
I agree with her.

06:59.168 --> 07:01.129
You really, really
played it safe.

07:01.129 --> 07:03.923
- I have never had a
manuscript rejected from Rita.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.258
- Just rewrite it.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.510
Get rid of Blake Montoya
and create a new character

07:07.510 --> 07:09.887
with higher stakes.
- No, I can't get rid of him.

07:09.887 --> 07:12.598
Blake Montoya, the fans
like Blake Montoya.

07:12.598 --> 07:15.268
They love Blake, they're
not just gonna spend pages

07:15.268 --> 07:16.060
learning a new char...

07:16.060 --> 07:16.894
I'm calling Rita.

07:16.894 --> 07:18.187
- Now look, Rita brought me in

07:18.187 --> 07:19.647
to help you find a new approach.

07:19.647 --> 07:21.440
We have to reinvent
you as an author.

07:21.440 --> 07:24.318
If you trust me, I can
help you make a comeback.

07:24.318 --> 07:25.653
- And if I don't?

07:25.653 --> 07:27.738
- The publisher
is gonna drop you.

07:27.738 --> 07:28.781
And Rita will, too.

07:29.699 --> 07:30.783
- Oh boy.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.747
- Sharon, check this out.

07:37.582 --> 07:40.960
What is the traditional 30th
wedding anniversary gift?

07:40.960 --> 07:42.295
- Is this a rhetorical question

07:42.295 --> 07:44.088
or do you actually
want me to guess?

07:44.088 --> 07:45.339
- Pearls.

07:45.339 --> 07:48.301
Pearls, for the cover of
the anniversary issue.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.802
So there is this rare blue pearl

07:49.802 --> 07:53.639
buried somewhere in Fiji and
I'm gonna be the one to find it

07:53.639 --> 07:56.100
and I'm gonna photograph
the entire thing.

07:56.100 --> 07:58.394
- And how are you gonna do that?

07:58.394 --> 07:59.353
- Glad you asked.

07:59.353 --> 08:01.480
So there's this guy
named Colin Page

08:01.480 --> 08:03.858
and he wrote a
romance-adventure book

08:03.858 --> 08:04.942
about eight years ago.

08:04.942 --> 08:06.110
International best seller.

08:06.110 --> 08:06.986
- Pearl in Paradise.

08:06.986 --> 08:08.321
- Yes.
- I love that book.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.156
- Okay, so in the
forward, he claims

08:10.156 --> 08:13.326
to be the only person who
knows where this pearl is.

08:14.577 --> 08:16.329
- Fantastic idea, Alex.

08:16.996 --> 08:18.831
You take the photos,
he'll handle the writing.

08:18.831 --> 08:21.000
Call this guy's agent and find
out how soon he can leave.

08:21.000 --> 08:21.834
- No, no, no, no.

08:21.834 --> 08:22.710
- Problem?

08:22.710 --> 08:24.420
- Well, I was just
gonna call him

08:24.420 --> 08:26.797
and interview him and then
I was gonna go on my own.

08:26.797 --> 08:28.174
- He's a best selling author.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.718
Can you imagine the guest
piece he'll come up with?

08:30.718 --> 08:32.386
- But I sort of imagined

08:32.386 --> 08:34.514
this first person
photographic narrative

08:34.514 --> 08:36.641
of my journey through
the rainforest,

08:36.641 --> 08:38.768
which would parallel
my emotional journey.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.189
I'll take the photos and
he can do the writing.

08:43.189 --> 08:45.733
- Great idea, glad
you thought of it.

08:45.733 --> 08:46.525
- Huh.

08:46.525 --> 08:47.860
- Have you read the book?

08:47.860 --> 08:50.029
- Yeah, yeah.

08:50.029 --> 08:52.281
- You should read the book.

08:52.281 --> 08:53.115
- Yeah.

08:56.869 --> 09:01.832
Hey Sharon, look I know I,
I know I really messed up,

09:01.832 --> 09:04.543
but if I can prove to
you that I am disciplined

09:04.543 --> 09:06.254
and organized enough
to pull this off,

09:06.254 --> 09:09.340
will you give me the
Creative Director position?

09:09.340 --> 09:10.716
- You'd certainly have an edge.

09:11.759 --> 09:13.010
- Is that a yes?

09:13.010 --> 09:14.262
- An edge.

09:14.262 --> 09:15.137
- I'll take it.

09:21.644 --> 09:23.396
- I'm not going to Fiji.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.190
Well no, I'm busy.

09:26.190 --> 09:28.150
I don't have six days to traipse

09:28.150 --> 09:30.820
around a rainforest
looking for a pearl.

09:30.820 --> 09:31.988
- I know you're a homebody,

09:31.988 --> 09:34.782
but National Discoveries
has 2.5 million readers.

09:34.782 --> 09:36.659
That's 2.5 million
people who will remember

09:36.659 --> 09:38.077
what a talented writer you are.

09:38.077 --> 09:39.912
That's 2.5 million
additional people

09:39.912 --> 09:41.789
to buy Taipei when it comes out.

09:41.789 --> 09:43.124
- It's a bad idea.

09:43.124 --> 09:44.667
- No, it's a good idea.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.794
You know where the
pearl is, now go get it.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.171
Oh wait, oh no, you didn't lie

09:49.171 --> 09:51.132
about the pearl
being real, did you?

09:51.132 --> 09:52.425
- No, no, no.

09:52.425 --> 09:56.220
I mean I have never seen it,
but I'm sure that it exists.

09:56.220 --> 09:57.722
- And you know
where it's buried?

09:57.722 --> 10:01.851
- Well see, I might
have oversold that part,

10:01.851 --> 10:02.768
just a little bit.

10:02.768 --> 10:04.562
- Can you find it
on Google Maps?

10:04.562 --> 10:08.733
- Look, can we please just
pass on this article idea?

10:08.733 --> 10:10.067
- Listen to me, C. P.

10:10.067 --> 10:11.777
- Please don't call me that.

10:11.777 --> 10:14.697
- I told you it doesn't matter
how fantastic the rewrite is

10:14.697 --> 10:15.990
if no one buys it.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.825
This article is the thing
we need to save your career.

10:17.825 --> 10:21.162
I'll forward your boarding
pass, you leave tomorrow.

10:21.162 --> 10:22.538
- Hello?

10:25.666 --> 10:26.625
Fiji.

10:31.505 --> 10:33.716
- Are you sure you're okay
apartment sitting for me

10:33.716 --> 10:35.176
for like the millionth time?

10:35.176 --> 10:36.469
- Of course.

10:37.636 --> 10:39.472
- Hey, have you,

10:39.472 --> 10:41.682
have you seen my Merino socks?

10:41.682 --> 10:44.685
- I have no idea what
you just asked me.

10:44.685 --> 10:45.728
- Found 'em.

10:45.728 --> 10:47.313
- Okay, so legend
has it that the pearl

10:47.313 --> 10:49.106
comes from a clam
instead of an oyster,

10:49.106 --> 10:50.483
which makes it more rare.

10:50.483 --> 10:51.525
- Yeah, I know.

10:51.525 --> 10:52.902
- How are you gonna find it?

10:52.902 --> 10:56.739
- A few good maps, an expert
guide, maybe a little faith.

10:56.739 --> 10:58.366
- And what will you do with it?

10:58.366 --> 11:01.619
- I think I would just donate
it to a museum in Fiji.

11:01.619 --> 11:03.829
Yeah, I think people
need to see it.

11:03.829 --> 11:05.790
Plus, it's not about the money,

11:05.790 --> 11:08.000
I just want the promotion.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.418
- I don't understand
why you want

11:09.418 --> 11:11.504
to be Creative Director so bad.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.339
You're gonna be home a lot more,

11:13.339 --> 11:16.258
not traveling as
much, managing staff.

11:16.258 --> 11:17.218
- I know.

11:17.218 --> 11:19.136
I know, Renee, but I just,

11:19.136 --> 11:21.806
I wanna inspire people
to go on adventures.

11:21.806 --> 11:23.516
You know, go see the world.

11:23.516 --> 11:26.268
Experience it, try new things.

11:26.268 --> 11:28.938
Exactly how dad
inspired me, you know?

11:28.938 --> 11:30.481
- Yeah, yeah I do.

11:31.816 --> 11:35.027
So wait, are you saying
that your globetrotting days

11:35.027 --> 11:37.738
are behind you and you're
ready to settle down?

11:37.738 --> 11:39.365
- No.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.242
- Okay, so listen to this.

11:41.242 --> 11:43.411
If a couple finds
this pearl together,

11:43.411 --> 11:46.247
it's true love and they're
destined to be married.

11:47.957 --> 11:50.042
So who's this guy you're
meeting up with again?

11:50.042 --> 11:51.293
- Stop it.

11:51.293 --> 11:52.253
I know what you're doing.

11:53.337 --> 11:55.005
Here, this is his book.

11:57.216 --> 11:59.677
- A Blake Montoya Adventure.

12:03.347 --> 12:05.850
Okay, so if this guy
claims to be the only one

12:05.850 --> 12:07.017
who knows where the pearl is,

12:07.017 --> 12:08.227
why didn't he bring
it back with him?

12:08.227 --> 12:09.687
- I don't know.

12:09.687 --> 12:11.147
I'm gonna ask him though.

12:11.147 --> 12:12.314
- Maybe he did.

12:12.314 --> 12:14.483
Maybe he just
didn't tell anyone.

12:14.483 --> 12:16.652
- Well all I do know is
that all of my research

12:16.652 --> 12:18.654
about the pearl leads
me back to this writer,

12:18.654 --> 12:21.532
so apparently he's the expert.

12:24.827 --> 12:25.870
Done, ta-da.

12:50.811 --> 12:54.064
- So it's 16 hours
ahead in Fiji,

12:54.064 --> 12:56.859
which makes it 9:30
in the morning, yeah.

12:56.859 --> 12:57.943
She should be awake.

13:05.826 --> 13:06.577
- Hello?

13:06.577 --> 13:08.245
- Hey Serita, hi.

13:08.245 --> 13:09.830
It's Colin Page, do you--

13:09.830 --> 13:12.166
- Colin, it's so nice to
hear your voice again.

13:12.166 --> 13:12.958
How's New York?

13:12.958 --> 13:14.627
- Well, New York is New York.

13:14.627 --> 13:15.586
How's Fiji?

13:15.586 --> 13:17.338
- Beautiful as always.

13:17.338 --> 13:21.550
- Well, do you remember all
those conversations we had

13:21.550 --> 13:23.552
when you trying to
get me to come to Fiji

13:23.552 --> 13:25.596
while I was researching my book?

13:25.596 --> 13:26.764
- How could I forget?

13:26.764 --> 13:27.806
- And do you remember

13:27.806 --> 13:30.601
that you said if I
were to come to Fiji

13:30.601 --> 13:33.521
that you would show me your
great grandfather's journal?

13:33.521 --> 13:35.731
I'm hoping it might
provide some clues

13:35.731 --> 13:37.650
as to where the pearl might be.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.443
- Let me guess.

13:39.443 --> 13:40.486
You're coming to Fiji.

13:40.486 --> 13:42.321
- Yes I am.

13:42.321 --> 13:44.990
- Wonderful, I can finally
put a face to the voice.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.992
- I'm really looking
forward to seeing you.

13:46.992 --> 13:48.702
- Me too.

14:25.781 --> 14:27.866
- Oh excuse me, sir,
I think this is mine.

14:27.866 --> 14:30.578
- Sorry, I think it's
mine, it matches my set.

14:30.578 --> 14:31.996
- Ah yeah, yeah,
no, I'm 100% sure.

14:31.996 --> 14:32.871
I've got my name on it.
- Are you sure?

14:32.871 --> 14:33.872
- It has a tag.
- So do I.

14:33.872 --> 14:34.707
- With my name on it.
- It's a tag

14:34.707 --> 14:35.624
with my name on it, too.

14:35.624 --> 14:37.501
It's a tag.
- I have a tag, no.

14:37.501 --> 14:38.669
No tag.

14:38.669 --> 14:40.254
All right, well why don't
you just open it up.

14:40.254 --> 14:42.965
I'm sure those fall
off all the time.

14:42.965 --> 14:43.716
- Right here?

14:43.716 --> 14:44.883
- Yeah, where else?

14:46.135 --> 14:48.762
- I still don't have time.

14:48.762 --> 14:49.597
- Oh.

14:50.598 --> 14:52.224
Yeah, here it is, there's mine.

14:52.224 --> 14:53.058
That's my name.

14:54.059 --> 14:54.893
- Okay.

15:04.153 --> 15:04.987
All right.

15:05.779 --> 15:06.864
Fiji.

15:12.244 --> 15:13.078
- Ladies
and gentlemen,

15:13.078 --> 15:14.121
may I have your attention.

15:14.121 --> 15:14.913
- Taxi.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.584
Hi.

15:18.584 --> 15:19.710
All right, hang on.

15:20.753 --> 15:21.712
- Well, hi.

15:23.422 --> 15:25.591
Thank you.

15:29.678 --> 15:30.512
- Okay.

15:33.682 --> 15:34.516
Taxi.

15:51.367 --> 15:52.660
- Hi, welcome.

15:53.452 --> 15:54.703
- Thank you.

16:02.711 --> 16:04.838
That would never happen.

16:04.838 --> 16:06.632
- You're all
checked in, Miss Anderson.

16:06.632 --> 16:07.549
- Ah, thank you.

16:07.549 --> 16:09.718
- You're most welcome.

16:09.718 --> 16:11.387
Anything else?

16:11.387 --> 16:13.806
- Ah, could you tell
me if Colin Page

16:13.806 --> 16:14.640
has checked in yet?

16:14.640 --> 16:15.432
- I'll check.

16:15.432 --> 16:16.266
- Thank you.

16:17.601 --> 16:19.561
- Uh, not yet.

16:19.561 --> 16:21.689
- Okay, can I leave him a note?

16:41.875 --> 16:44.211
- Colin, I can't wait to
start this adventure with you.

16:44.211 --> 16:46.839
Let's meet in the lobby
tomorrow at eight for breakfast.

16:48.006 --> 16:48.799
Alex.

16:56.098 --> 16:57.766
- The party's
just getting started,

16:57.766 --> 17:01.478
DJ Isikeli is going to keep
you moving, Fiji style.

17:01.478 --> 17:02.521
- All right.

17:05.649 --> 17:06.775
So much for writing.

17:12.698 --> 17:13.824
- Bartender.

17:14.658 --> 17:15.492
Surprise me.

17:16.785 --> 17:18.120
- Okay, hi, excuse me.

17:18.120 --> 17:19.872
Excuse
me, is this noise,

17:19.872 --> 17:23.375
is it gonna be
this loud all day?

17:23.375 --> 17:24.626
- Hey you.

17:24.626 --> 17:27.004
I see you finally
found your bag.

17:27.004 --> 17:28.714
- I was right, wasn't I?

17:28.714 --> 17:30.007
It was mine.
- Sorry.

17:30.007 --> 17:31.759
- Yeah, and also for the record

17:31.759 --> 17:33.510
you happened to take my cab,

17:33.510 --> 17:34.720
but that is neither
here nor there.

17:34.720 --> 17:35.679
- What?

17:35.679 --> 17:36.513
What are you talking about?

17:36.513 --> 17:37.556
- What is that?

17:37.556 --> 17:39.600
- I have no idea,
but it's really good.

17:39.600 --> 17:40.726
You want one?
- No, no, no,

17:40.726 --> 17:41.643
I'm a tea, I don't know.

17:41.643 --> 17:42.770
I'm a tea drinker.

17:42.770 --> 17:43.645
- You're what?

17:43.645 --> 17:45.981
- Tea, I drink tea.

17:45.981 --> 17:47.441
- Tea?
- Mm-hmm.

17:47.441 --> 17:48.734
- In this climate?

17:48.734 --> 17:50.027
- Oh no, any climate.

17:50.027 --> 17:50.903
Yeah, no, it's...

17:51.737 --> 17:53.280
Anyway I gotta get
back to my room

17:53.280 --> 17:55.365
and get some work done before
I head out tomorrow morning

17:55.365 --> 17:56.700
on this ridiculous thing.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.368
- Back up to your room?

17:58.368 --> 18:01.079
Come on, you're in the
middle of paradise here.

18:01.079 --> 18:03.540
Bartender, can you
get him one of these?

18:03.540 --> 18:06.293
- Okay, twist my arm.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.255
- Yeah, just slow down.

18:13.967 --> 18:15.719
So tell me about
this ridiculous thing

18:15.719 --> 18:16.929
you gotta do tomorrow.

18:18.096 --> 18:19.515
- Okay, yeah.

18:19.515 --> 18:24.436
So I'm a writer
and eight years ago

18:24.436 --> 18:26.271
I wrote a book called
Pearl in Paradise

18:26.271 --> 18:27.815
and so tomorrow I'm heading out

18:27.815 --> 18:30.943
on a trekking adventure
through the rainforest

18:30.943 --> 18:33.195
with a photographer
that I've never met

18:33.195 --> 18:34.530
to help her write an article

18:34.530 --> 18:36.281
for a magazine I don't read.

18:37.324 --> 18:38.158
Thank you.

18:39.284 --> 18:40.077
- Wow.

18:41.787 --> 18:43.705
You're Colin Page.

18:43.705 --> 18:45.958
- Yeah, I am.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.292
Have you read my book?

18:47.292 --> 18:48.418
- Yes.

18:48.418 --> 18:50.587
Yeah, I actually just
got through reading it

18:50.587 --> 18:51.880
about five minutes ago.

18:53.757 --> 18:55.217
- That's a coincidence.

18:55.217 --> 18:56.218
What'd you think?

18:56.218 --> 18:58.136
- Well I just
couldn't put it down.

18:58.136 --> 18:59.847
- Thank you, I appreciate that.

18:59.847 --> 19:01.265
And you are?

19:01.265 --> 19:02.391
- I'm Alex Anderson.

19:03.433 --> 19:04.476
Photographer.

19:04.476 --> 19:05.644
National Discoveries
- National Discoveries

19:05.644 --> 19:06.728
Magazine.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.023
- Yeah.

19:10.023 --> 19:13.360
Or you can just call me your
ridiculous thing partner.

19:13.360 --> 19:14.862
- Um, that...

19:16.405 --> 19:17.614
- Yeah.

19:23.453 --> 19:24.913
- Okay, hold on a second.

19:24.913 --> 19:27.249
Let's try this again, shall we?

19:27.249 --> 19:29.418
Are you Alex Anderson,
the famous photographer

19:29.418 --> 19:31.628
from National
Discovery Magazine?

19:31.628 --> 19:33.213
Because I'm a huge fan.

19:33.213 --> 19:34.256
- Oh you are?

19:34.256 --> 19:35.465
- Yes, I am actually.
- Are you really?

19:35.465 --> 19:36.675
- No, honestly I am.

19:36.675 --> 19:39.511
When I found out we were
doing this article together,

19:39.511 --> 19:41.221
I went online and I looked
at the last 10 issues

19:41.221 --> 19:44.099
of your work and I think
you're very talented.

19:44.099 --> 19:45.434
- Well thank you.

19:45.434 --> 19:47.519
- Yeah, I mean I don't know
anything about photography.

19:48.562 --> 19:50.188
Did you actually read my book?

19:50.188 --> 19:51.523
- Yes, I did.
- Yeah?

19:51.523 --> 19:52.649
But what'd you think?

19:52.649 --> 19:54.192
- I thought that Blake Montoya

19:54.192 --> 19:56.236
was a phenomenal character.

19:56.236 --> 19:57.112
- Yeah?

19:57.112 --> 19:58.614
- Yeah, he's
attractive and smart

19:58.614 --> 20:00.282
and he always knows what to say.

20:00.282 --> 20:02.451
I mean he's basically
like the perfect guy.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.620
I can understand how
women all over the world

20:04.620 --> 20:05.704
love this book.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.541
For me, some of the
technical details

20:09.541 --> 20:11.376
didn't ring true, but that's...

20:12.711 --> 20:13.754
- Which ones?

20:13.754 --> 20:14.963
- Do you have all day?

20:14.963 --> 20:16.423
- Are you?

20:16.423 --> 20:17.299
- I'm joking.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.051
I'm joking.

20:20.594 --> 20:21.553
How do you know
where the pearl is?

20:21.553 --> 20:24.473
- Now that is confidential.

20:24.473 --> 20:27.684
I can't, I can't
reveal my sources.

20:27.684 --> 20:28.977
- What?
- Yeah.

20:28.977 --> 20:30.604
- You're not gonna tell me?
- No, I'm gonna show you.

20:31.855 --> 20:34.441
- Okay, all right,
I can respect that.

20:34.441 --> 20:36.276
Well can you at least tell
me what it looks like?

20:38.737 --> 20:40.781
- I don't know
what it looks like.

20:41.990 --> 20:42.699
- What?

20:42.699 --> 20:43.617
- No, I've never seen it.

20:43.617 --> 20:44.743
I don't know how big it is.

20:44.743 --> 20:45.577
I don't know what color it is.

20:45.577 --> 20:47.412
I made all that up for my book.

20:48.580 --> 20:49.915
- Okay, but why didn't
you just dig it up

20:49.915 --> 20:51.416
the first time you went to Fiji?

20:51.416 --> 20:53.543
- Well, that's the thing Alex,

20:53.543 --> 20:55.754
I've never even
been to Fiji before.

20:56.672 --> 20:57.714
- You've never been here?

20:57.714 --> 20:58.840
- Uh-uh.
- Are you serious?

20:58.840 --> 21:00.259
- Nope, I wrote Pearl
of Paradise entirely

21:00.259 --> 21:02.636
from my home office
in Saratoga Springs.

21:03.971 --> 21:06.306
- Okay, so let me
get this straight.

21:06.306 --> 21:07.474
So you never been to Fiji,

21:07.474 --> 21:09.768
yet you know where
this pearl is buried?

21:09.768 --> 21:11.728
- That's, yes, that's
what I'm saying.

21:11.728 --> 21:13.271
And I have my sources.

21:13.271 --> 21:16.525
- Oh yeah, yeah, your
confidential sources, right?

21:16.525 --> 21:17.609
- Yeah.

21:17.609 --> 21:18.986
- Okay.

21:20.112 --> 21:22.572
You know for someone
who's never been to Fiji,

21:22.572 --> 21:26.618
your description's like spot on.

21:27.452 --> 21:29.997
- Exhaustive research, all
my books are like that.

21:30.747 --> 21:33.166
- Well wouldn't you
rather go see a place

21:33.166 --> 21:36.253
in person, you know
like feel the energy?

21:36.253 --> 21:38.797
- I can get all
that in a library.

21:39.631 --> 21:40.716
- Library?
- Huh.

21:40.716 --> 21:41.842
- Come on, you look.

21:43.510 --> 21:46.722
You can't get, you can't
get this from a library.

21:49.725 --> 21:51.476
- Okay, if I do my job well,

21:51.476 --> 21:53.270
then the reader can
stay in the comfort

21:53.270 --> 21:55.313
of their own home and
they can travel the world

21:55.313 --> 21:56.690
using their imagination.

21:57.858 --> 21:59.443
- And if I do my job well,

21:59.443 --> 22:02.654
then I can inspire people
to go and see the places

22:02.654 --> 22:03.572
that I take photos of.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.867
- Huh, fair enough.

22:06.867 --> 22:07.701
- Yeah.

22:09.077 --> 22:12.164
You know I remember the first
time I ever took a photo.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.207
- You do?
- Mm-hmm.

22:14.207 --> 22:17.753
Yep, I was in middle
school and I went hiking

22:17.753 --> 22:19.796
to these foothills with my dad.

22:19.796 --> 22:21.256
He was a big hiker.

22:22.257 --> 22:25.010
And the sun was
setting and we stopped,

22:25.010 --> 22:29.264
the light was just perfect,
but then I took a picture

22:29.264 --> 22:30.682
and I brought it back
to school with me

22:30.682 --> 22:32.517
and there was this boy at school

22:32.517 --> 22:35.979
who was so inspired
by my little photo

22:35.979 --> 22:39.232
that he took his dad to see
these very same foothills.

22:39.232 --> 22:40.692
And I think that was
actually the first time

22:40.692 --> 22:42.694
he ever went hiking
with his dad.

22:44.529 --> 22:45.322
Yeah.

22:46.865 --> 22:47.657
- That's cool.

22:49.743 --> 22:51.078
- Yeah, it was cool.

22:52.245 --> 22:54.623
That's the moment,
that's when I knew

22:54.623 --> 22:57.042
this is what I wanna do
for the rest of my life.

22:59.669 --> 23:00.462
That was it.

23:00.462 --> 23:01.296
- Huh.

23:02.380 --> 23:05.717
- You know I think with my
photos and your writing,

23:05.717 --> 23:08.220
this article is
gonna be really good.

23:08.220 --> 23:08.929
- Here's hoping.

23:08.929 --> 23:10.889
- Oh, it is.
- Yeah.

23:12.557 --> 23:14.476
- Now I'm just
right up here, so.

23:14.476 --> 23:17.562
- Okay, well do you still

23:17.562 --> 23:19.064
wanna meet tomorrow
morning at eight?

23:19.064 --> 23:20.315
- Yeah, eight's fine.

23:20.315 --> 23:22.400
Ah, I might be 8:15.

23:23.193 --> 23:24.027
- I'll wait.

23:27.364 --> 23:29.241
Thank you, Alex.
- Bye.

23:50.053 --> 23:51.888
- Ben Watso n already
turned in his article

23:51.888 --> 23:53.181
on the cliff in China?

23:53.181 --> 23:55.934
- Yesterday afternoon,
fascinating.

23:55.934 --> 23:57.477
Now the only reason
I'm telling you this

23:57.477 --> 24:01.481
is because I need something
really great from you on time.

24:01.481 --> 24:03.775
- Okay, I promise
you'll get that.

24:04.609 --> 24:05.694
Hold on.

24:06.945 --> 24:08.280
Hey, can I call you right back?

24:08.280 --> 24:09.114
- Okay.

24:09.114 --> 24:10.615
- Thanks.

24:10.615 --> 24:11.616
Hello?

24:11.616 --> 24:12.784
- Hi, Alex, it's Colin.

24:13.827 --> 24:16.705
What exactly do you pack
for a three day hike?

24:18.123 --> 24:21.376
- Yeah, well did you
bring your entire closet?

24:21.376 --> 24:23.545
- Well you know I
wanted to be prepared.

24:23.545 --> 24:25.297
- Yeah, but it's only prepared

24:25.297 --> 24:26.756
if you bring the right things.

24:26.756 --> 24:30.635
- Okay, well.

24:30.635 --> 24:32.971
- No, denim retains moisture.

24:32.971 --> 24:35.807
- These are rated
five star online.

24:38.393 --> 24:40.562
- These are zero stars
for the rainforest.

24:40.562 --> 24:43.315
There's no waterproof
lining here, no tread.

24:43.315 --> 24:44.649
I mean these are great
if you wanna walk

24:44.649 --> 24:45.859
through a parking lot.

24:48.820 --> 24:49.696
No.

24:49.696 --> 24:51.615
- They're sunglasses, Alex.

24:51.615 --> 24:52.949
- They're not polarized.

24:52.949 --> 24:54.618
You're not gonna be able to see.

24:55.619 --> 24:57.370
- This sounds like
a lovely experience.

24:57.370 --> 25:00.290
- You know what this can
be a lovely experience

25:00.290 --> 25:02.918
if you have the right clothing
and the right attitude

25:02.918 --> 25:05.587
you might actually
have fun.

25:05.587 --> 25:08.256
And then we can both be
little Blake Montoya's.

25:08.256 --> 25:09.549
Right?

25:09.549 --> 25:10.759
Come on, let's go shopping.

25:10.759 --> 25:12.510
- Okay, can I make
a list real quick?

25:12.510 --> 25:14.471
- No, no, no, no,
I don't do lists.

25:14.471 --> 25:16.139
It's all, it's all right here.

25:16.139 --> 25:17.724
- I do, do lists, so I need to,

25:17.724 --> 25:19.684
it's a peace of
mind thing, hold on.

25:19.684 --> 25:20.644
- Are you coming?

25:20.644 --> 25:22.187
- No, what if we
forget something?

25:22.187 --> 25:23.521
- Okay, but if you're
gonna forget something,

25:23.521 --> 25:25.732
won't you also forget
to put it on the list?

25:25.732 --> 25:27.484
- What?

25:27.484 --> 25:28.318
- Come on.

25:29.069 --> 25:30.320
- It doesn't even make sense,

25:30.320 --> 25:32.364
if you, you, you,
you put it on a list

25:32.364 --> 25:33.657
when you remember it.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.785
Hold on, so if, so if your boss

25:36.785 --> 25:40.205
chooses your story on
the pearl for the cover,

25:40.205 --> 25:41.373
you'll get a promotion?

25:41.373 --> 25:43.166
- Yeah, and then I get
to have more control

25:43.166 --> 25:44.501
of the kinds of stories we do

25:44.501 --> 25:46.753
and when I become
Creative Director,

25:46.753 --> 25:48.588
I wanna do more like these.

25:48.588 --> 25:50.632
Hi, can we have two, please?

25:52.384 --> 25:53.385
Have you ever had these?

25:53.385 --> 25:54.261
- Coconuts?

25:55.345 --> 25:56.554
- Well they're called Neo Domo,

25:56.554 --> 25:58.556
they're a type of coconut, yeah.

25:58.556 --> 25:59.683
Thank you.
- Cool.

25:59.683 --> 26:01.059
- Thank you.

26:01.059 --> 26:02.435
- They are amazing.

26:03.520 --> 26:05.897
Cheers to trying new things.

26:09.943 --> 26:12.529
- Yeah, well that's, that is,

26:12.529 --> 26:14.239
it's a lot sweeter than
I thought it would be.

26:14.239 --> 26:15.407
- See?

26:15.407 --> 26:17.617
Can't get that from
a book, now can you?

26:28.003 --> 26:29.421
- Here, here, here you go.

26:33.508 --> 26:36.428
So if we don't get a
picture of the pearl,

26:36.428 --> 26:39.264
then you get neither the
promotion nor the cover?

26:39.264 --> 26:40.015
- Yep.

26:40.015 --> 26:41.516
But I have a secret weapon.

26:42.767 --> 26:43.560
You.

26:44.394 --> 26:46.604
And do you, do you like beige?

26:46.604 --> 26:47.731
- I prefer blue.

26:47.731 --> 26:48.440
- Try these.

26:48.440 --> 26:49.733
Oh, look a solar shower.

26:53.278 --> 26:54.154
- What's that?

26:54.154 --> 26:55.322
- A solar shower.

26:55.322 --> 26:57.282
You fill it up with water,
you hang it up in a tree

26:57.282 --> 26:58.533
and then the sun heats the water

26:58.533 --> 26:59.576
and when you're done
you just pack it up

26:59.576 --> 27:01.244
and you're ready to go.

27:01.244 --> 27:02.787
How cool is that?

27:02.787 --> 27:04.039
Look at that.

27:04.039 --> 27:05.540
- I mean most women I know
wouldn't wanna take a shower

27:05.540 --> 27:08.126
from a bag hanging
in a tree, but.

27:08.126 --> 27:10.003
- Oh yeah, they
just read about it.

27:12.964 --> 27:13.798
Hi.

27:15.675 --> 27:17.594
- This is a lot of stuff.

27:17.594 --> 27:20.096
- Yeah, there's a little
expedition happening.

27:20.096 --> 27:22.307
Well, look at that.

27:22.307 --> 27:23.808
- Oh little blue pearls.

27:23.808 --> 27:25.560
- So this is in reference
to the legend, right?

27:25.560 --> 27:28.521
You find the blue pearl and
then you find true love?

27:28.521 --> 27:31.649
- Yeah, it's too bad no
one's ever found it though.

27:31.649 --> 27:33.610
All those doomed relationships.

27:33.610 --> 27:34.819
- Well Colin here,

27:34.819 --> 27:36.488
did write a book about it.

27:36.488 --> 27:38.990
It's a fiction book, but still.

27:38.990 --> 27:40.909
- Wait, Colin.

27:40.909 --> 27:43.036
You're, you're Colin Page?

27:43.036 --> 27:43.870
- Yes.

27:45.413 --> 27:47.624
- Oh my gosh, I've
read your book.

27:47.624 --> 27:48.833
I read all your books.

27:48.833 --> 27:50.502
Oh papa, papa come here.

27:51.378 --> 27:52.462
- Hello.

27:52.462 --> 27:53.838
- This is the guy who
wrote Pearl in Paradise.

27:53.838 --> 27:56.508
- Blake Montoya, in the flesh.

27:56.508 --> 27:58.802
Oh it is a pleasure to meet you.

27:58.802 --> 27:59.928
- Actually, I'm--

27:59.928 --> 28:01.262
- I'm Malakai and this
is my daughter, Daniela.

28:01.262 --> 28:02.055
- Hi.
- Hi, Daniela.

28:02.055 --> 28:03.390
This is my friend, Alex.

28:03.390 --> 28:04.516
- Hi, I'm Alex Anderson.

28:04.516 --> 28:05.934
- It's nice to meet you.

28:05.934 --> 28:06.935
- We love that book.

28:06.935 --> 28:08.728
My business has
tripled because of it.

28:08.728 --> 28:09.896
People come from
all around the world

28:09.896 --> 28:10.855
just to find the blue pearl.

28:12.148 --> 28:13.566
- Bula.
- Bula.

28:13.566 --> 28:15.693
- But they always
leave empty handed.

28:15.693 --> 28:17.612
- Well, they've come
to find the pearl.

28:17.612 --> 28:19.823
- Well, how romantic,
when's the big day?

28:19.823 --> 28:21.658
- Oh no, no, no.
- Ah, no, no, no, no.

28:21.658 --> 28:22.659
We're not, it's a strictly

28:22.659 --> 28:23.952
professional.
- Professional.

28:23.952 --> 28:26.287
I'm a photographer for
Natural Discoveries Magazine.

28:26.287 --> 28:27.539
- I cannot believe
the real Blake Montoya

28:27.539 --> 28:29.666
is standing right
here in my store.

28:29.666 --> 28:31.292
- Actually I'm not,
I'm not Blake Montoya.

28:31.292 --> 28:32.502
He's just a character
that I created.

28:32.502 --> 28:34.003
I'm a writer, I'm
an author, so...

28:34.003 --> 28:34.796
My name is Colin Page.

28:34.796 --> 28:35.964
I'm Colin Page.

28:35.964 --> 28:38.216
- I know that, but how
different can you be?

28:38.216 --> 28:39.217
You wrote it.

28:39.217 --> 28:40.718
Blake Montoya came
from somewhere, right?

28:40.718 --> 28:41.636
Hey Daniela, call your mother

28:41.636 --> 28:42.762
and tell her to come down here.

28:42.762 --> 28:44.055
- Oh no, no, no, you
don't need to do that.

28:44.055 --> 28:45.223
- I'll just text her.

28:48.685 --> 28:50.562
- Will you autograph it?

28:50.562 --> 28:51.646
- Sure.

28:51.646 --> 28:54.649
- Ah, Malakai, M-A-L-A-K-A-I.

28:54.649 --> 28:55.483
- Okay.

28:57.735 --> 28:59.320
- And Daniela.
- Sure.

28:59.320 --> 29:01.364
- Do you guys happen
to know of a local guy,

29:01.364 --> 29:02.991
someone that can
take us on a hike?

29:02.991 --> 29:04.909
- It would be my honor,
if I could take you

29:04.909 --> 29:07.745
and your fiance up to
find the pearl, no charge.

29:07.745 --> 29:08.621
We can leave in the morning.

29:08.621 --> 29:10.957
- Yeah, oh yeah,
that'd be great.

29:10.957 --> 29:12.125
But are you okay?

29:12.125 --> 29:14.169
I mean it's gonna be three
days out of your time.

29:14.169 --> 29:17.714
- Two days, there are roads
part way up we can drive.

29:17.714 --> 29:18.756
- That's great news.

29:18.756 --> 29:20.091
- No, no, no, no, no.

29:20.091 --> 29:21.718
I have to take pictures along
the way for the magazine,

29:21.718 --> 29:22.844
so we'll be hiking.

29:22.844 --> 29:24.262
- We could pull over and
you can take pictures

29:24.262 --> 29:25.889
of the things--
- Can I go with you, please?

29:25.889 --> 29:27.932
- My daughter will come,
she's an avid hiker.

29:27.932 --> 29:29.017
- The more the merrier.

29:29.017 --> 29:30.768
- Yeah, no, we'll get the photos

29:30.768 --> 29:32.729
to your Editor-in-Chief sooner

29:32.729 --> 29:34.272
if we do that, if we don't hike.

29:34.272 --> 29:36.733
- I have so much to learn from
an experienced outdoorsman

29:36.733 --> 29:37.859
like Blake Montoya.

29:40.653 --> 29:41.696
- I'm not winning
this argument, am I?

29:41.696 --> 29:42.780
- No.

29:43.615 --> 29:45.742
- Ah, pictures.

29:45.742 --> 29:46.701
- Smile.

29:49.913 --> 29:54.959
- Well, Mr. Blake Montoya,
hope you've done your research.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.133
- Okay.

30:03.301 --> 30:04.135
Hi.

30:05.637 --> 30:07.013
- So her name is Serita?

30:07.013 --> 30:07.931
- Yes.

30:07.931 --> 30:09.641
- And she works
here at the library?

30:09.641 --> 30:10.850
- Uh-huh.

30:10.850 --> 30:13.686
I mean I just wanna interview
her for the article.

30:13.686 --> 30:14.854
- She knows about the pearl?

30:14.854 --> 30:16.064
- She does, but I think
it's always important

30:16.064 --> 30:19.150
to get a local
perspective, you know?

30:19.150 --> 30:22.570
Have some unique insight, it
could be valuable, important.

30:22.570 --> 30:24.989
- But I thought that
you were the expert.

30:24.989 --> 30:26.157
- Oh I am.

30:26.157 --> 30:27.617
But you can never learn
too much about the pearl,

30:27.617 --> 30:29.661
plus you're gonna get
some beautiful photographs

30:29.661 --> 30:30.703
if you haven't already.

30:30.703 --> 30:31.996
It's right here.

30:34.582 --> 30:35.416
Serita?

30:37.168 --> 30:37.961
- Colin.

30:37.961 --> 30:38.795
- Hi.

30:39.754 --> 30:41.839
- It's so nice to see you.

30:43.841 --> 30:46.469
And this is?
- Hi, I'm Alex.

30:46.469 --> 30:48.680
It's nice to meet you.

30:48.680 --> 30:50.473
- Thank you.
- The both of you.

30:50.473 --> 30:51.724
Please sit.

30:52.559 --> 30:54.769
I found the journal
for you, Colin.

30:54.769 --> 30:57.730
- Ah, that is amazing, Serita.

30:58.523 --> 31:00.692
- It's a collection
of handmade maps,

31:00.692 --> 31:02.986
notes, even some poems.

31:02.986 --> 31:04.529
- Poems?

31:04.529 --> 31:05.613
Do you, um, do...

31:05.613 --> 31:07.115
Is it okay if I leaf through it?

31:07.115 --> 31:08.241
- Mm-hmm.

31:08.241 --> 31:10.159
My great grandfather,
he wrote many poems

31:10.159 --> 31:11.786
to his beloved wife back home.

31:11.786 --> 31:13.246
- Oh that's sweet.

31:13.246 --> 31:15.540
- It's like a love
story unfolding

31:15.540 --> 31:16.916
right before you eyes.

31:16.916 --> 31:18.710
- Would you mind if
I took some shots?

31:18.710 --> 31:19.752
- Of course.

31:22.672 --> 31:24.215
The journal can be
read in many ways.

31:24.215 --> 31:25.800
You can see it for what it is

31:25.800 --> 31:28.219
or for what you want it to be.

31:28.219 --> 31:31.055
- Okay, this is amazing.

31:31.055 --> 31:33.057
Serita, I appreciate it.

31:33.057 --> 31:34.559
- Mm-hmm.

31:34.559 --> 31:35.893
- Yeah, me too.

31:35.893 --> 31:38.021
- And you know it's nice to
finally meet you face to face.

31:38.021 --> 31:40.148
- Well you can learn
a lot from a face.

31:40.148 --> 31:44.319
- Would it be alright if I
borrowed this for a few days,

31:44.319 --> 31:46.654
just to get your
grandfather's perspective

31:46.654 --> 31:50.658
and I promise you that I
will guard it with my life.

31:52.577 --> 31:54.245
- I have no doubt in
my heart you will.

31:54.245 --> 31:56.080
- Ha, that's great.

31:56.080 --> 31:57.206
This is great.

31:59.125 --> 32:04.339
- Uh, he loves his research.

32:10.762 --> 32:12.055
- Hi.

32:12.055 --> 32:12.847
- Hi.
- Hey.

32:12.847 --> 32:14.057
You came down.

32:14.057 --> 32:15.892
- Yeah, I thought I'd take
a little bit of a break.

32:15.892 --> 32:16.726
- Yeah.

32:18.102 --> 32:19.687
- How's the food?

32:19.687 --> 32:20.688
- It's excellent.

32:20.688 --> 32:21.439
- Good.
- Yeah.

32:21.439 --> 32:22.607
Really, really good.

32:22.607 --> 32:24.067
- I just wanted to let you know

32:24.067 --> 32:27.278
how excited I am about tomorrow.

32:27.278 --> 32:28.321
- You are?
- Yeah.

32:32.950 --> 32:35.286
That is my cue to
get back to work.

32:35.286 --> 32:36.287
- No, no, no, no, no.

32:36.287 --> 32:38.331
You have to dance
with me, come on.

32:38.331 --> 32:39.582
It looks like fun, try it.

32:39.582 --> 32:42.126
Come on, dance with me.

32:42.126 --> 32:45.838
- Oh boy, I
haven't danced in a while.

32:46.714 --> 32:48.800
- All right, well I
know you know how.

32:50.760 --> 32:52.762
Come on, just loosen
up a little bit.

32:54.472 --> 32:56.849
Nobody's looking at
you, don't worry.

33:02.271 --> 33:04.148
You're doing good, see?

33:04.148 --> 33:06.359
Blake Montoya can dance, right?

33:06.359 --> 33:08.152
- Well, I'm not Blake, so.

33:16.452 --> 33:17.829
- I love this music.

33:27.672 --> 33:28.798
This is nice, huh?
- Yeah.

33:28.798 --> 33:30.883
- This is fun.
- This is fun, you're right.

33:55.992 --> 33:57.326
- Yay.

33:57.326 --> 33:58.161
- Yay.

33:59.871 --> 34:01.581
- Ah, look at that.

34:01.581 --> 34:03.958
Now you really get to
show me how you can dance.

34:03.958 --> 34:04.959
What are you doing?

34:05.918 --> 34:07.295
- I should get some work done.

34:07.295 --> 34:10.006
I should get some work done,
but I will see you tomorrow.

34:10.006 --> 34:11.549
Bright and early.
- Okay.

34:11.549 --> 34:12.717
- Good night, Alex.

34:12.717 --> 34:13.718
- Colin.

34:18.389 --> 34:20.141
Okay, night.

34:37.992 --> 34:40.077
Hey, sorry I'm late.

34:40.077 --> 34:41.454
- Hey, you look, you look great.

34:41.454 --> 34:43.414
You look like a character
out of one of my books.

34:43.414 --> 34:44.373
- And you look like you're ready

34:44.373 --> 34:46.417
to hike the Fijian rainforest.

34:46.417 --> 34:47.752
- Hey.

34:47.752 --> 34:49.337
- Hey.
- Hey guys.

34:49.337 --> 34:52.089
- Bula, let's hit the road.

34:52.089 --> 34:53.758
- All right.

34:53.758 --> 34:55.635
- Hey, woo.
- Thank you.

35:02.225 --> 35:06.771
- Okay.

35:38.553 --> 35:40.555
- Hey, I brought my camera, too.

35:40.555 --> 35:41.973
Maybe you can give
me some pointers.

35:41.973 --> 35:43.808
- Sure, yeah.

35:43.808 --> 35:45.143
- Thanks.

35:45.143 --> 35:47.103
I was on the yearbook staff
in my high school, you know?

35:47.103 --> 35:48.229
- That is very cool.

35:49.355 --> 35:51.107
You know I would say the
key is to find something

35:51.107 --> 35:52.149
you're passionate about.

35:52.149 --> 35:54.610
Something that
really inspires you.

35:54.610 --> 35:56.487
- Oh, this is beautiful.

35:57.697 --> 35:58.865
- Yeah, it is.

36:02.994 --> 36:04.829
- Well, let's go, Mr. Montoya.

36:44.285 --> 36:47.038
- We don't have
to go in there, do we?

36:47.038 --> 36:48.205
In there?

36:48.205 --> 36:49.665
- Yeah, it's a jungle, Colin.

36:50.541 --> 36:51.959
You're not afraid
of spiders, are you?

36:51.959 --> 36:52.835
- Why?

36:54.712 --> 36:55.546
Why?

36:56.881 --> 36:57.715
Dang it.

36:58.758 --> 36:59.800
Okay.

36:59.800 --> 37:01.260
I don't like this.

37:02.303 --> 37:04.639
- Blake Montoya.

37:12.772 --> 37:13.856
Oh.

37:14.523 --> 37:17.485
- Malakai, what is it?

37:17.485 --> 37:19.737
- It's a Tagimoucia orchid.

37:19.737 --> 37:21.239
- How can it be?

37:22.073 --> 37:23.741
- A, a what?

37:23.741 --> 37:24.659
- A Tagimoucia.

37:24.659 --> 37:26.702
It means to cry in your sleep.

37:26.702 --> 37:27.870
- It's beautiful.

37:27.870 --> 37:29.580
That's the national
flower of Fiji, isn't it?

37:29.580 --> 37:30.831
Isn't that right?

37:30.831 --> 37:33.584
- Yeah, but it only grows
on the island of Taveuni.

37:33.584 --> 37:34.669
Northeast of here.

37:36.003 --> 37:38.047
I've never seen
one on this island.

37:38.047 --> 37:39.298
- It means something.

37:40.424 --> 37:45.054
- Yeah, sometimes things
appear when least expected.

37:49.475 --> 37:51.602
- It's really
something actually.

37:51.602 --> 37:52.895
- Yeah, it is.

37:54.605 --> 37:55.398
Oh, oh.

37:57.274 --> 37:58.109
- You okay?
- Thanks.

37:58.109 --> 37:58.859
- Yeah, no I'm fine.

37:58.859 --> 37:59.944
- Got you.
- Thank you.

37:59.944 --> 38:01.362
I'm good.

38:01.362 --> 38:03.280
Sorry, sometimes I
just get all wrapped up

38:03.280 --> 38:05.616
in getting that shot.

38:05.616 --> 38:06.784
- You sure it's not your shoes

38:06.784 --> 38:07.952
because you know
you need the ones

38:07.952 --> 38:09.328
with the tread
- The boots with the tread

38:09.328 --> 38:10.371
and the waterproof lining.
- and the waterproof lining.

38:10.371 --> 38:11.455
- Yeah, I've got all that.

38:11.455 --> 38:13.541
Who taught you that?
- A very wise woman.

38:13.541 --> 38:14.625
- Mm-hmm.

38:14.625 --> 38:16.252
- Very good
at what she does.

38:16.252 --> 38:17.712
- She is good at what she does.

38:20.965 --> 38:22.883
- Oh, watch your step.

38:25.261 --> 38:26.887
- Oh look, it's an old balabala.

38:28.931 --> 38:30.850
- Ah, that's beautiful.

38:31.684 --> 38:33.019
- That is very cool.

38:35.980 --> 38:37.606
- Why don't you try this?

38:37.606 --> 38:39.483
- Really?
- Yeah, go ahead.

38:39.483 --> 38:41.527
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

38:53.706 --> 38:54.707
- Oh no.

38:54.707 --> 38:57.168
I'm sorry.
- No, no, no, it's okay.

38:57.168 --> 38:57.918
Are you okay?

38:57.918 --> 38:59.628
- I'm okay, but your lens.

39:00.796 --> 39:03.716
- You know what actually
I don't think it's broke.

39:04.967 --> 39:09.180
Alright, I have some lens
wipes in my bag here.

39:09.180 --> 39:10.473
It'll be okay.

39:13.392 --> 39:15.811
I thought I put 'em in here.

39:16.771 --> 39:17.730
- Do you have any?

39:21.025 --> 39:22.526
- No.

39:22.526 --> 39:25.154
I must
have left 'em at home.

39:26.655 --> 39:27.948
This is my only short zoom.

39:27.948 --> 39:29.450
- Can I see it for a second?

39:29.450 --> 39:33.204
- Um, okay, just don't
wipe it on your shirt.

39:33.204 --> 39:34.872
You'll scratch the lens.

39:35.748 --> 39:36.832
- I know.

39:39.627 --> 39:42.213
So the tannic acid in black tea

39:42.213 --> 39:46.258
acts as a non-abrasive
cleansing agent.

39:50.805 --> 39:52.056
To dissolve the dirt.

39:53.390 --> 39:54.391
Look at that.

39:54.391 --> 39:56.227
Good as new.

39:58.479 --> 40:00.731
- Remarkable,
how did you know that?

40:00.731 --> 40:02.566
- Ah, a bit of research.

40:02.566 --> 40:03.567
I know a lot about tea.

40:03.567 --> 40:05.361
- In Diamonds in Dubai.

40:05.361 --> 40:06.821
Blake Montoya was trying
to catch an exporter

40:06.821 --> 40:09.907
who was smuggling gems from
Europe in crates of tea.

40:09.907 --> 40:12.201
- Aha, Blake Montoya
strikes again.

40:14.161 --> 40:15.704
- Thanks.

40:15.704 --> 40:16.789
- Yeah.

40:26.048 --> 40:28.759
- Alright, we'll stop here
and make camp for the night.

40:28.759 --> 40:30.928
- Ah, that's terrific.

40:30.928 --> 40:31.762
Exhausted.

40:31.762 --> 40:33.431
I'm exhausted.

40:33.431 --> 40:34.265
- Ah, not here.

40:35.057 --> 40:35.808
Down there.

40:37.434 --> 40:38.310
- Down there?

40:39.562 --> 40:41.564
- It's too steep to hike,
so we'll tie off a line

40:41.564 --> 40:43.482
to be safe and descend by rope.

40:44.650 --> 40:46.694
- Did he just say
descend by rope?

40:54.785 --> 40:55.870
- Okay.

40:57.037 --> 40:58.038
Good to go.

40:58.038 --> 40:58.998
Who's going first?

40:59.999 --> 41:01.000
Colin?

41:01.000 --> 41:03.127
- Ah, actually I
think that one of us

41:03.127 --> 41:04.086
should probably go first.

41:04.086 --> 41:05.629
- No, no, no, no,
I got it, Alex.

41:05.629 --> 41:06.964
- I can go, I can go.

41:06.964 --> 41:08.215
You can watch me go down.

41:08.215 --> 41:11.093
- Alex, it's a rope,
how hard can it be?

41:11.093 --> 41:12.469
- Seriously I can help you.

41:12.469 --> 41:14.722
- Seriously I'm fine.

41:14.722 --> 41:16.724
I just pitch it down, right?

41:17.474 --> 41:18.767
You throw the rope out.

41:20.644 --> 41:21.729
- Why don't
you just tell them

41:21.729 --> 41:23.397
you've never done this before?

41:23.397 --> 41:24.815
- All right, guys.

41:26.942 --> 41:30.154
See you at the bottom.

41:30.154 --> 41:30.988
How hard can it be?

41:31.864 --> 41:36.660
- Oh.

41:41.790 --> 41:42.833
- You okay?

41:42.833 --> 41:44.126
- Hey, I'm coming down.

41:45.169 --> 41:46.128
- I'm okay.

41:48.339 --> 41:49.173
I'm okay.

41:53.636 --> 41:55.888
- Come on.

41:55.888 --> 41:57.598
- Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

41:57.598 --> 41:58.474
don't move, are you okay?

41:58.474 --> 41:59.808
- No, I'm okay, I'm okay.

41:59.808 --> 42:02.019
I'm all right.
- Are you sure?

42:02.019 --> 42:03.520
- I'm okay.

42:03.520 --> 42:05.522
- You fell pretty far.

42:07.900 --> 42:10.319
- We're gonna build,
we'll go pitch tents.

42:10.319 --> 42:12.363
- Yeah no, Daniela
and I can do that.

42:13.530 --> 42:14.865
One of you guys go
gather some firewood.

42:14.865 --> 42:17.368
- Yeah, we'll do that.

42:17.368 --> 42:18.202
Colin, this way.

42:18.202 --> 42:19.662
- All right.
- This way.

42:19.662 --> 42:20.829
- I'm okay.

42:26.085 --> 42:28.545
- You know I could have
helped you out there.

42:28.545 --> 42:31.090
- What would
Blake Montoya have done?

42:31.090 --> 42:32.049
- He would
have been the first

42:32.049 --> 42:33.550
to grab the rope just like you.

42:33.550 --> 42:35.135
- There you go.

42:35.135 --> 42:36.887
I gotta be honest.

42:37.805 --> 42:39.056
It was thrilling.

42:39.056 --> 42:40.891
I mean until obvi, until
it wasn't and then it hurt.

42:43.769 --> 42:44.687
It just hurt.

42:45.729 --> 42:47.064
- It looked like it hurt.

42:51.527 --> 42:54.446
- So what does your
boyfriend think

42:54.446 --> 42:55.614
about you being
gone all the time

42:55.614 --> 42:56.824
when you're trekking
around the world

42:56.824 --> 42:58.242
taking pictures of
volcanoes and wild animals

42:58.242 --> 43:00.369
and stuff or is
that,

43:00.369 --> 43:01.620
is that too personal?

43:02.621 --> 43:05.582
- No, no, it's not too personal.

43:06.709 --> 43:07.876
Well trekking around the world

43:07.876 --> 43:09.586
and taking pictures of volcanoes

43:09.586 --> 43:12.756
and wild animals
and stuff is

43:12.756 --> 43:14.925
exactly why I don't
have a boyfriend.

43:15.968 --> 43:17.094
Turns out in relationships,

43:17.094 --> 43:19.430
people actually wanna
spend time together.

43:20.055 --> 43:21.598
Imagine that, right?
- Fancy that.

43:24.935 --> 43:26.437
- What about you though?

43:26.437 --> 43:29.690
Mr. Romance slash
adventure novelist.

43:29.690 --> 43:32.109
I mean you must have women
lined up around the block.

43:32.109 --> 43:33.861
- Ah yeah, I do, which is why

43:33.861 --> 43:35.821
I moved into a gated community.

43:38.449 --> 43:42.619
Um, no all kidding
aside, yeah, I date,

43:43.912 --> 43:45.789
but it just never seems to last.

43:46.832 --> 43:47.666
- Why?

43:50.502 --> 43:54.631
- Because I think they
expect Blake Montoya.

43:54.631 --> 43:55.841
And I'm not Blake.

43:55.841 --> 43:58.552
And even Malakai and
Daniela expect him

43:58.552 --> 44:02.181
and he's you know this
adventure seeking guy

44:02.181 --> 44:04.475
who lives for danger
and Colin Page

44:04.475 --> 44:08.270
is a writer who sits in
a room all day long alone

44:08.270 --> 44:10.189
telling stories for a living.

44:10.189 --> 44:12.608
- Yeah, but Colin Page is,

44:12.608 --> 44:17.488
he's smart and nice.

44:17.488 --> 44:19.615
He's got a good sense of humor.

44:19.615 --> 44:21.158
He's maybe even a
little good looking.

44:21.158 --> 44:21.950
- Really?

44:21.950 --> 44:22.701
- Yeah.

44:22.701 --> 44:23.827
- I got a maybe?
- Mm-hmm.

44:23.827 --> 44:25.287
- A little?

44:25.287 --> 44:26.789
- Just, just a little.

44:37.591 --> 44:40.302
- And in the haze of
the dawn, they saw it.

44:40.302 --> 44:42.513
"Could that be it?"
Valencia asked.

44:42.513 --> 44:43.680
"Is that the pearl?"

44:43.680 --> 44:45.557
Blake craned his head closer

44:45.557 --> 44:49.144
and saw the magnificent
opalescent shimmer.

44:49.144 --> 44:51.563
At last, they found it.

44:51.563 --> 44:53.816
- It is an honor to be
reading your book with you.

44:53.816 --> 44:55.109
- Papa, don't interrupt.

44:55.109 --> 44:56.860
My favorite part's coming up.

44:56.860 --> 44:59.154
They kiss after they
find the blue pearl.

45:00.864 --> 45:02.449
Do you think the pearl's
gonna look like that

45:02.449 --> 45:03.409
when we find it?

45:04.785 --> 45:06.703
Do you think the clam's
gonna be there, too?

45:08.747 --> 45:10.874
- That is confidential.

45:19.383 --> 45:20.259
- So?

45:23.804 --> 45:24.596
- Starry night.

45:30.727 --> 45:32.479
The pearl of love.

45:32.479 --> 45:34.523
When all seemed lost I
turned my back on the rocks

45:34.523 --> 45:37.359
and I followed the
path of my tears.

45:45.701 --> 45:48.579
Where I fell asleep
for 50 years.

45:48.579 --> 45:49.580
- Busy?

45:49.580 --> 45:51.248
- Oh, (clears throat) hey.

45:52.458 --> 45:53.292
- Here you go.

45:54.418 --> 45:55.586
Soursop.

45:55.586 --> 45:56.795
Native fruit to Fiji.

46:01.842 --> 46:03.552
- That's amazing, thank you.

46:04.636 --> 46:06.430
- I didn't think you'd
ever tried it before.

46:06.430 --> 46:07.264
- No.

46:08.891 --> 46:11.185
- I get the sense this might
be your first time to Fiji.

46:12.603 --> 46:14.730
- You got that from
our first day hiking?

46:14.730 --> 46:15.939
- I got that from the first time

46:15.939 --> 46:17.149
you walked into my store.

46:17.149 --> 46:18.525
- Ah, geez.

46:18.525 --> 46:19.776
Was that obvious?

46:20.569 --> 46:23.030
Malakai, I gotta be
honest with you, man.

46:23.030 --> 46:26.450
I am a fraud, in every
sense of the word.

46:26.450 --> 46:30.329
- Yeah, I wouldn't
say that my friend.

46:30.329 --> 46:32.998
The only person
you can be is you.

46:33.790 --> 46:36.877
- No, there's something
that I have to tell Alex

46:36.877 --> 46:38.504
that I haven't told her yet.

46:40.422 --> 46:42.049
I don't know where the pearl is.

46:43.217 --> 46:44.801
- I know.

46:44.801 --> 46:45.552
- You know?

46:45.552 --> 46:47.471
- Of course, nobody does.

46:48.305 --> 46:50.557
It's a fairy tale, it's a myth.

46:50.557 --> 46:52.017
It's good for business
and a fun story

46:52.017 --> 46:53.810
and people come from
all around the world

46:53.810 --> 46:57.064
just to find the blue
pearl, but nobody ever does.

46:58.148 --> 46:59.566
- No, Malakai, I'm sorry.

46:59.566 --> 47:02.653
Look, look, look, look, I
know generally where it is,

47:02.653 --> 47:04.404
it's on the other
side of the river.

47:04.404 --> 47:08.033
It's there, I just don't know
exactly where it's buried.

47:08.033 --> 47:10.827
And that what I was hoping
was that this journal

47:10.827 --> 47:13.121
would, I don't know,
provide some clues,

47:13.121 --> 47:15.749
some link to my missing...

47:15.749 --> 47:17.251
See he found it.

47:17.251 --> 47:18.669
Well he claimed to
have found the pearl,

47:18.669 --> 47:19.753
he knew where it was.

47:21.213 --> 47:22.548
- Perhaps you have
to ask yourself

47:22.548 --> 47:25.592
if he found it, why
would he have left it?

47:29.054 --> 47:33.308
Look, my friend, Ku
operates a eco-village

47:33.308 --> 47:34.768
not far from here.

47:34.768 --> 47:36.728
About three kilometers away.

47:36.728 --> 47:39.898
His father, Akamu knows a
great deal about the legend.

47:39.898 --> 47:40.857
Maybe he can help.

47:40.857 --> 47:42.109
- Yeah?

47:42.109 --> 47:42.859
- Yeah.

47:42.859 --> 47:43.777
- That would be awesome.

47:46.363 --> 47:49.700
- Colin, (sighs) good night.

47:50.993 --> 47:51.827
- Good night.

47:56.206 --> 47:57.291
- Thank you again.
- And when all seemed lost.

47:57.291 --> 47:57.916
I turned my back
- Night, all right.

47:57.916 --> 47:58.875
- on the rocks.

47:58.875 --> 47:59.960
- All right.
- And followed the path

47:59.960 --> 48:00.877
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- of my tears

48:00.877 --> 48:02.087
where I fell asleep for 50 years

48:02.087 --> 48:04.590
and I woke to the prize
of your bright starry eyes

48:04.590 --> 48:07.968
and saw them reflected where
your love forever lies.

48:11.555 --> 48:13.599
- I didn't know you
were such a poet.

48:13.599 --> 48:16.893
- Uh no, um, this is
the, this is the poem

48:16.893 --> 48:19.688
that Serita's great
grandfather wrote to his wife.

48:20.606 --> 48:21.690
It's a love poem.

48:21.690 --> 48:25.027
And it's, I don't
know, this journal

48:25.027 --> 48:29.781
is filled with, look at it,
sketches, and pressed flowers.

48:34.494 --> 48:36.580
And then you got a waterfall.

48:37.456 --> 48:39.583
- What do you think
all this stuff means?

48:39.583 --> 48:40.834
- I don't know.

48:42.210 --> 48:43.045
It's a mystery.

48:47.591 --> 48:51.303
- Speaking of mystery,
look up there.

48:53.013 --> 48:54.598
I love the night sky.

48:54.598 --> 48:57.267
My dad used to take me
camping when I was little

48:57.267 --> 49:00.771
and I always used to sleep
underneath the stars.

49:00.771 --> 49:02.439
I loved it, I still do.

49:04.524 --> 49:06.276
Look at that one right up there.

49:06.276 --> 49:08.070
Straight ahead right there.

49:08.070 --> 49:09.488
That's Sagittarius.

49:10.739 --> 49:11.615
I figured you'd like it 'cause
it's shaped like a teapot.

49:11.615 --> 49:12.991
- It's a teapot.

49:12.991 --> 49:14.368
- Yeah.

49:14.368 --> 49:17.746
- And right next to
Sagittarius is Aquila.

49:19.956 --> 49:21.541
- You know constellations?

49:21.541 --> 49:25.712
- Yeah, I'm, I read the Odyssey

49:25.712 --> 49:27.964
while I was in 8th grade I
became a bit of a star nerd.

49:27.964 --> 49:29.383
- Uh-huh, I read that.

49:29.383 --> 49:30.384
- Yeah?
- I loved it.

49:30.384 --> 49:31.259
Yeah, great book.

49:31.259 --> 49:32.302
- It's a great book, yeah.

49:32.302 --> 49:34.304
That book made me wanna learn

49:34.304 --> 49:35.597
everything I could about stars.

49:35.597 --> 49:37.557
- Made me wanna
travel the world.

49:38.558 --> 49:41.645
Yeah, you know I always
wanted to do this piece

49:41.645 --> 49:43.438
on astronomy for the magazine.

49:43.438 --> 49:47.234
And what I would do is I would
create a travel map, right?

49:47.234 --> 49:49.486
And I'd start in the
Northern Hemisphere

49:49.486 --> 49:52.656
and I would show you
all the constellations

49:52.656 --> 49:54.950
you'd see as you traveled south.

49:54.950 --> 49:55.784
- That's a great idea.

49:55.784 --> 49:56.785
- Yeah?

49:56.785 --> 49:58.704
- Why didn't you do it?

49:58.704 --> 50:00.163
- Last Creative
Director killed it,

50:00.163 --> 50:03.291
so I just kinda forgot about it.

50:04.626 --> 50:06.336
- It's a brilliant idea.

50:06.336 --> 50:07.629
Promise me that
you'll revisit it

50:07.629 --> 50:10.799
because that is a trip
that even I would make.

50:10.799 --> 50:12.092
- Really?

50:12.092 --> 50:12.843
- Yeah.

50:14.553 --> 50:17.264
- All right then, I'll keep
that in my back pocket.

50:22.310 --> 50:25.897
Well, I'm pretty tired.
- You gonna go to sleep?

50:25.897 --> 50:26.732
- Yeah.

50:31.111 --> 50:32.195
- Hey Alex.

50:32.195 --> 50:33.029
- Yes.

50:38.493 --> 50:39.494
- Sweet dreams.

50:41.038 --> 50:41.872
- You too.

51:08.899 --> 51:11.443
So this is your
friend's eco-lodge, huh?

51:11.443 --> 51:12.694
- Totally off the grid.

51:12.694 --> 51:14.571
Operated by my friend, Ku.

51:14.571 --> 51:16.573
Once was a place his
grandmother lived.

51:16.573 --> 51:18.575
The villagers all moved out,

51:18.575 --> 51:20.619
but she wanted to preserve it.

51:20.619 --> 51:23.246
- What I wanna do is
interview Ku's father

51:23.246 --> 51:24.080
for the article.

51:24.080 --> 51:25.248
- Yeah, I think that'd be great.

51:25.248 --> 51:26.583
This place is lovely.

51:26.583 --> 51:28.084
My friend I've asked him.

51:28.084 --> 51:29.920
- My friend.
- Hey, hey, hey.

51:29.920 --> 51:31.588
- You finally made it.

51:31.588 --> 51:33.590
- Good to see you
- Good to see you.

51:33.590 --> 51:34.758
- Come to see.
- Remember my daughter,

51:34.758 --> 51:35.842
Daniela?
- Of course.

51:35.842 --> 51:37.260
- Hey, good
to see you again.

51:37.260 --> 51:38.595
- Good to see you, Daniela.

51:38.595 --> 51:41.389
- This is Colin, the famous
author of Pearl in Paradise.

51:41.389 --> 51:43.266
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Likewise.

51:43.266 --> 51:45.560
- Alex, a famous
American photographer.

51:45.560 --> 51:46.394
- Pleased to meet you, Alex.

51:46.394 --> 51:47.354
- It's nice to meet you.

51:47.354 --> 51:49.272
- Ku, can Colin
talk to your father?

51:49.272 --> 51:50.190
- He's not here.

51:51.733 --> 51:52.943
But he's coming over for dinner.

51:52.943 --> 51:54.402
You could meet him then.

51:54.402 --> 51:55.320
- Yeah?

51:55.320 --> 51:56.947
That would be
perfect, thank you.

51:56.947 --> 51:58.657
- Please come with
me, right this way.

51:58.657 --> 52:00.075
- How are you?
- Not too bad, man.

52:00.075 --> 52:01.117
It's good to see you.

52:01.117 --> 52:02.160
- You've
done some renovation.

52:02.160 --> 52:03.912
- Yes, yes,
yes, you like it?

52:09.334 --> 52:10.585
- Well thank you guys so much

52:10.585 --> 52:13.547
for having us for
dinner, Mr. Akamu.

52:13.547 --> 52:14.798
- Just Akamu.

52:14.798 --> 52:16.007
- Akamu, sorry.

52:16.007 --> 52:19.302
Um, so Alex and I are working
on an article together

52:19.302 --> 52:21.680
about the pearl for the
magazine that she works for.

52:21.680 --> 52:24.057
- Natural Discoveries,
I'm taking the pictures

52:24.057 --> 52:25.100
and he's writing the article.

52:25.100 --> 52:27.602
- Yeah and Malakai
said that you know

52:27.602 --> 52:29.855
a great deal about the pearl.

52:29.855 --> 52:31.439
- As do you.

52:31.439 --> 52:32.691
I know your book.

52:32.691 --> 52:34.651
A fine tale.

52:34.651 --> 52:36.862
- Yeah well, thank you.

52:36.862 --> 52:40.073
Which leads me to
ask you a question.

52:40.073 --> 52:43.451
Do you think that
the description

52:43.451 --> 52:45.620
of the pearl in my book...

52:45.620 --> 52:48.498
- Lived up to your
experience of it?

52:49.499 --> 52:50.375
- I've never seen it.

52:54.629 --> 52:55.881
- I'm confused.

52:56.756 --> 53:00.010
- Ah, how do you know it exists?

53:00.010 --> 53:01.303
- Because I do.

53:05.015 --> 53:07.017
A British man wrote
about it many years ago.

53:07.017 --> 53:09.644
- Right, right, I
have his journal.

53:09.644 --> 53:11.396
Should I, do you wanna see it?

53:11.396 --> 53:14.316
- There is a little known
legend among my people,

53:14.316 --> 53:15.859
about the origin of the pearl.

53:15.859 --> 53:16.651
- Yeah?

53:16.651 --> 53:18.945
The legend of the fisherman.

53:18.945 --> 53:21.364
- You've done your research.

53:21.364 --> 53:23.575
- Wait a minute, the legend
of, that's not in your book.

53:23.575 --> 53:26.286
- No, no, but I mean I
know of its existence.

53:26.286 --> 53:27.704
You can't find it
anywhere online.

53:27.704 --> 53:29.372
There's no written record of it.

53:29.372 --> 53:30.373
It's oral history.

53:32.918 --> 53:34.419
Do you know it?

53:38.548 --> 53:39.633
- Could you tell us?

53:41.301 --> 53:44.554
- 600 years ago, there
was a poor fisherman,

53:44.554 --> 53:47.641
in love with the daughter
of a wealthy aristocrat

53:47.641 --> 53:49.267
who would not let them marry.

53:49.267 --> 53:51.311
One day, while he
was looking for clams

53:51.311 --> 53:55.565
in the Navua River, he
navigated through a tributary

53:55.565 --> 53:58.944
and there he found a giant clam.

53:58.944 --> 54:04.199
The clam opened, revealing
a beautiful rare blue pearl.

54:05.992 --> 54:08.703
The fisherman was ecstatic.

54:08.703 --> 54:09.913
What luck!

54:09.913 --> 54:12.749
He thought if he gave the
pearl to the young woman,

54:12.749 --> 54:16.294
he'd prove to her and her
family that he was worthy

54:16.294 --> 54:18.588
of their daughter's
hand in marriage.

54:18.588 --> 54:20.548
So he put the pearl
in a wooden box

54:20.548 --> 54:22.342
to present to the family.

54:22.342 --> 54:26.596
As he sailed back, the rains
came rocking the small boat.

54:26.596 --> 54:30.058
The pearl fell back
into the water.

54:30.058 --> 54:31.810
The fisherman was so devastated,

54:31.810 --> 54:34.604
he couldn't bring himself
to face the young woman.

54:34.604 --> 54:36.648
He spent his remaining
years searching

54:36.648 --> 54:38.233
in vain for the pearl.

54:40.527 --> 54:43.113
And cried in his
sleep for 50 years.

54:44.447 --> 54:47.742
Over the next few centuries,
the tributary dried up.

54:48.493 --> 54:52.580
And it is said that the
fisherman's decades of tears

54:52.580 --> 54:55.709
now flow over the rocky shores
that remain in its wake.

54:57.544 --> 55:00.547
- It is believed that the
pearl represents the love

55:00.547 --> 55:03.508
that the young woman and the
fisherman should have had.

55:03.508 --> 55:06.052
- He spent his entire life
going after the pearl,

55:06.928 --> 55:09.389
when he should have been
going after her heart.

55:09.389 --> 55:10.390
- He thought that the pearl

55:10.390 --> 55:11.891
would make him
worthy of her love,

55:12.726 --> 55:14.811
but he already had her love.

55:14.811 --> 55:17.355
He lost his faith in her.

55:17.355 --> 55:20.900
The pearl itself
was worth nothing.

55:23.486 --> 55:26.573
- Its worth is what
is accorded to it.

55:26.573 --> 55:28.825
Find the fisherman's lost love,

55:30.535 --> 55:32.495
and you will find the pearl.

55:34.080 --> 55:37.542
Now, enough talk, please eat.

55:38.668 --> 55:42.255
- This looks, this
looks very good.

55:44.007 --> 55:46.509
- Hey.

55:46.509 --> 55:47.469
- Good morning.

55:47.469 --> 55:48.094
- Good morning, Daniela.
- Good morning.

55:48.094 --> 55:48.845
- How are you?

55:48.845 --> 55:49.804
- How are you guys?

55:49.804 --> 55:50.930
- We're doing good,
how'd you sleep?

55:50.930 --> 55:52.474
- Yeah, pretty
good, how 'bout you?

55:52.474 --> 55:53.975
- Like a baby.
- A bit buggy.

55:55.310 --> 55:57.312
Malakai, hey where's your stuff?

55:57.312 --> 56:00.607
- Oh, yeah it rained
further down the island

56:00.607 --> 56:02.150
and there may be flooding.

56:02.150 --> 56:04.903
Akamu's asked me to hang
around and help out.

56:04.903 --> 56:06.154
You two should be fine

56:06.154 --> 56:08.573
to navigate the rest of
the way by yourself, yeah?

56:08.573 --> 56:09.908
- Yeah.

56:09.908 --> 56:11.034
- Yeah.

56:11.034 --> 56:13.870
- Be careful and we'll
see you when you get back.

56:13.870 --> 56:15.497
- With the pearl.

56:15.497 --> 56:16.790
- With the pearl.

56:16.790 --> 56:19.667
Got it.

56:19.667 --> 56:21.920
- Hey, thanks for everything.

56:28.551 --> 56:31.679
- Rained further down
the island, really?

56:31.679 --> 56:33.181
- Seemed believable to me.

56:34.641 --> 56:37.018
They have to do
this on their own.

56:37.018 --> 56:39.145
You know that, Daniela.

56:39.145 --> 56:39.979
- I do.

56:51.533 --> 56:53.576
- Woo, look at this.

56:53.576 --> 56:54.577
- Look at me.

56:55.745 --> 56:57.205
Okay, now look away.

56:59.207 --> 57:00.041
It's good.

57:01.251 --> 57:02.043
- Hey.

57:04.796 --> 57:06.172
Thank you.

57:06.172 --> 57:07.924
- For
taking your picture?

57:07.924 --> 57:09.551
- No, for this.

57:09.551 --> 57:11.010
For pitching the
idea for the article.

57:11.010 --> 57:13.388
I mean I wouldn't have
come here otherwise.

57:15.682 --> 57:17.058
- That's really sweet.

57:18.351 --> 57:19.727
Yeah, you're welcome.

57:29.195 --> 57:30.947
- I can't, Alex.

57:30.947 --> 57:33.533
- What are you talking
about, yeah you can.

57:33.533 --> 57:36.161
- No, I mean I have something
that I need to tell you, Alex.

57:36.161 --> 57:38.538
And it's something that I
should've been honest about

57:38.538 --> 57:40.748
before we even left for Fiji.

57:40.748 --> 57:42.500
- Okay.

57:42.500 --> 57:46.754
- I don't know exactly
where the pearl is buried.

57:51.634 --> 57:54.220
- Okay, but you,

57:55.638 --> 57:59.934
you know like generally
where it is, right?

58:01.895 --> 58:02.979
Are you kidding me?

58:02.979 --> 58:04.439
- I'm sorry, I thought
I was gonna be able

58:04.439 --> 58:05.481
to piece together information

58:05.481 --> 58:07.025
from the journal and interviews.

58:07.025 --> 58:09.235
- If you are just
now telling me this.

58:09.235 --> 58:10.445
- Okay, hold on, I wanted
to tell you sooner,

58:10.445 --> 58:11.654
but then you told me
how high the stakes were

58:11.654 --> 58:13.656
with your promotion
and inspiring people.

58:13.656 --> 58:16.326
And, and, and, and
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

58:17.660 --> 58:19.037
- Why did you lie to me?

58:24.751 --> 58:27.003
Why would you lie to me?

58:27.003 --> 58:32.217
- I didn't plan on this and I
didn't want to let you down.

58:32.675 --> 58:33.843
For the first time in my life

58:33.843 --> 58:35.637
I thought that I could
be as adventurous

58:35.637 --> 58:39.641
and as exciting as this
figment of my imagination

58:39.641 --> 58:41.684
that I cannot live up to.

58:41.684 --> 58:42.518
I mean...

58:44.354 --> 58:45.813
He always knows that
right things to say

58:45.813 --> 58:47.565
and I clearly don't.

58:47.565 --> 58:51.819
And when you called me and you
offered me this opportunity,

58:51.819 --> 58:53.571
I was scared, Alex,
I didn't wanna do it,

58:53.571 --> 58:54.906
but I was also so excited

58:54.906 --> 58:57.283
and I thought for a
second if I could just,

58:58.618 --> 59:00.245
that if we could do this,

59:01.079 --> 59:02.163
that we could find this pearl

59:02.163 --> 59:05.208
that somehow I'd fix
it, but all it did

59:05.208 --> 59:08.378
is prove that I am
a disappointment.

59:09.087 --> 59:11.089
And I'm sorry, I'm sorry
that I lied to you.

59:11.089 --> 59:12.507
I am sorry that I
wasted your time

59:12.507 --> 59:16.177
and I am sorry that I
got your hopes up, Alex.

59:22.016 --> 59:22.809
So.

59:25.561 --> 59:27.480
I guess we should
head back, huh?

59:32.193 --> 59:33.611
- Colin, Colin.

59:39.409 --> 59:42.912
For somebody who doesn't
know what to say,

59:42.912 --> 59:44.747
you certainly knew what to say.

59:47.292 --> 59:48.626
And I gotta be honest with you.

59:48.626 --> 59:51.254
If you would've told me all
of that back in New York,

59:51.254 --> 59:54.007
that you didn't know
where the pearl was.

59:54.007 --> 59:55.675
I still would've
come on this trip.

1:00:00.305 --> 1:00:03.683
- But would you ask
me to come with you?

1:00:10.773 --> 1:00:11.524
- Yeah.

1:00:18.740 --> 1:00:19.532
Look at this.

1:00:19.532 --> 1:00:21.534
Look at where we are right now.

1:00:23.995 --> 1:00:28.374
I mean who knows what's
out there, right?

1:00:28.374 --> 1:00:29.959
Who knows what we're gonna see.

1:00:32.628 --> 1:00:34.672
And I wanna inspire people

1:00:34.672 --> 1:00:36.841
and I know you wanna
inspire people.

1:00:38.468 --> 1:00:39.802
So let's do this.

1:00:41.179 --> 1:00:42.388
Let's keep going.

1:00:43.806 --> 1:00:44.640
You with me?

1:00:44.640 --> 1:00:45.683
- Yeah.

1:00:45.683 --> 1:00:48.102
- What have we got to lose?

1:00:56.027 --> 1:00:59.489
- Wow, this is beautiful.

1:00:59.489 --> 1:01:02.825
Okay, according to this map.

1:01:02.825 --> 1:01:04.452
- Yeah.
- Look, there's a bridge

1:01:04.452 --> 1:01:05.536
about a mile that way,

1:01:05.536 --> 1:01:07.705
so you know we'd have
to double back, but.

1:01:07.705 --> 1:01:09.832
- No, no, I say we cross it.

1:01:10.666 --> 1:01:12.001
Yeah.

1:01:12.001 --> 1:01:13.669
It doesn't look that deep.

1:01:13.669 --> 1:01:15.463
- It's, it's, it's moving.

1:01:16.506 --> 1:01:17.465
Pretty fast.

1:01:18.383 --> 1:01:19.717
- That's not fast,
you'll be fine.

1:01:19.717 --> 1:01:22.720
Look, everything that's
important goes in a dry bag.

1:01:26.849 --> 1:01:28.684
- What's a dry bag?

1:01:29.519 --> 1:01:32.355
Wow, you are prepared.

1:01:42.323 --> 1:01:43.699
- All right then.

1:01:45.660 --> 1:01:46.494
Good luck.

1:01:54.085 --> 1:01:55.253
- Alex.

1:01:55.253 --> 1:01:56.087
Alex!

1:01:57.505 --> 1:01:58.756
Come here.

1:01:58.756 --> 1:01:59.924
I got you, I got you.

1:02:01.634 --> 1:02:02.844
I got it.

1:02:02.844 --> 1:02:04.095
I'll get it.

1:02:04.095 --> 1:02:04.929
Here.

1:02:30.329 --> 1:02:33.040
- Come here, come here.

1:02:33.040 --> 1:02:34.834
You okay?

1:02:34.834 --> 1:02:35.960
- Yeah.

1:02:35.960 --> 1:02:36.794
You?

1:02:48.264 --> 1:02:52.768
All right, I told you we
should have taken the bridge.

1:02:52.768 --> 1:02:53.644
- The bridge.

1:02:56.230 --> 1:02:57.773
I'm so sorry.

1:02:57.773 --> 1:02:59.692
I will listen to
you from now on.

1:03:01.527 --> 1:03:04.655
I gotta tell you though,
we make a good team, huh?

1:03:04.655 --> 1:03:05.781
- Yeah, we do.
- Yeah, we do.

1:03:05.781 --> 1:03:08.701
- All that's missing
is the pearl, right?

1:03:08.701 --> 1:03:10.703
- Yeah, the pearl.

1:03:10.703 --> 1:03:11.954
You know what?

1:03:11.954 --> 1:03:14.707
I don't even care about
my promotion anymore.

1:03:14.707 --> 1:03:15.958
- Yeah?
- No.

1:03:15.958 --> 1:03:17.084
- That's crazy.

1:03:17.084 --> 1:03:20.963
I haven't thought about
my book in three days.

1:03:20.963 --> 1:03:22.924
Yeah, I just,

1:03:23.799 --> 1:03:25.426
I just wanna find the pearl.

1:03:27.553 --> 1:03:29.180
- I want us to find that pearl.

1:03:29.931 --> 1:03:30.765
I really do.

1:03:34.560 --> 1:03:36.521
And I think that we should, um,

1:03:38.814 --> 1:03:40.024
we should keep going.

1:03:44.195 --> 1:03:46.197
- I'm so close.
- Yeah.

1:03:54.664 --> 1:03:55.831
What?

1:03:55.831 --> 1:03:56.666
What?

1:03:58.751 --> 1:03:59.752
Wait, are you crying?

1:03:59.752 --> 1:04:02.338
- No, I got,
a bug in my eye.

1:04:04.340 --> 1:04:05.841
- Oh, it looks
like you're crying.

1:04:05.841 --> 1:04:06.676
- My eye.

1:04:11.681 --> 1:04:12.515
- Wait a minute.

1:04:13.266 --> 1:04:14.058
Hold on.

1:04:14.058 --> 1:04:15.434
- What?

1:04:15.434 --> 1:04:17.270
- I just, I just
thought of something

1:04:17.270 --> 1:04:19.105
that Akamu said last night.

1:04:19.105 --> 1:04:20.940
He was talking
about the fisherman

1:04:20.940 --> 1:04:22.567
and the decades of tears.

1:04:22.567 --> 1:04:23.609
- Right, decades of tears.

1:04:23.609 --> 1:04:25.778
- Ah, fisherman's
decades of tears

1:04:25.778 --> 1:04:27.530
flow over the rocky shores.

1:04:27.530 --> 1:04:29.657
- You have a very good memory.

1:04:29.657 --> 1:04:30.866
- All up here, remember?

1:04:30.866 --> 1:04:33.911
Yeah, hey, can you just
um, can I see that journal?

1:04:33.911 --> 1:04:38.541
- Yeah.

1:04:38.541 --> 1:04:39.333
Here.

1:04:39.333 --> 1:04:40.376
- Okay.

1:04:40.376 --> 1:04:43.212
Could you, could
you just show me

1:04:43.212 --> 1:04:46.048
the page that you were
looking at with the waterfall?

1:04:47.842 --> 1:04:48.718
Decades of tears.

1:04:48.718 --> 1:04:50.678
- The waterfall.
- The waterfall.

1:04:50.678 --> 1:04:52.388
- It's the waterfall.
- Yeah.

1:04:52.388 --> 1:04:53.514
- Oh my gosh.

1:04:53.514 --> 1:04:57.727
Okay, so we are here and
the waterfall is here.

1:04:57.727 --> 1:05:00.146
That is where we need to be.

1:05:00.146 --> 1:05:01.480
- Bingo.

1:05:01.480 --> 1:05:03.899
Yes!

1:05:09.572 --> 1:05:10.990
It's a waterfall.

1:05:12.742 --> 1:05:15.494
- I mean woo, look at this!

1:05:17.079 --> 1:05:19.832
You're right, you can't
get this from a book.

1:05:19.832 --> 1:05:20.916
- Right?

1:05:20.916 --> 1:05:22.668
All right, here, I wanna
document this moment.

1:05:22.668 --> 1:05:23.753
- Yes.

1:05:24.629 --> 1:05:25.880
- All right, ready?

1:05:25.880 --> 1:05:26.631
- Yeah.

1:05:26.631 --> 1:05:27.673
- You gonna smile?

1:05:27.673 --> 1:05:28.466
- Uh-huh.

1:05:28.466 --> 1:05:29.342
- One, two.

1:05:32.803 --> 1:05:35.306
It's not perfect, but
it's got something.

1:05:36.682 --> 1:05:37.683
- We gotta be close.

1:05:40.853 --> 1:05:42.438
- I definitely
see how this place

1:05:42.438 --> 1:05:44.148
can bring out the
poet in anyone.

1:05:46.400 --> 1:05:47.234
- Wait.

1:05:48.402 --> 1:05:49.612
What did you just say?

1:05:51.614 --> 1:05:53.491
- I was just saying
how beautiful it is.

1:05:53.491 --> 1:05:56.118
It can almost turn
anybody into a poet.

1:05:56.118 --> 1:05:57.244
Look at this place.

1:05:57.244 --> 1:05:58.704
- Oh my gosh, the poem.

1:06:00.456 --> 1:06:03.250
Okay, the fisherman's tears.

1:06:04.627 --> 1:06:06.128
It's the waterfall.

1:06:06.128 --> 1:06:08.130
When all seemed lost,

1:06:09.006 --> 1:06:11.884
I turned my back on the rocks.

1:06:19.392 --> 1:06:21.310
- And followed the
path of my tears.

1:06:28.609 --> 1:06:30.152
It's the stream.

1:06:31.404 --> 1:06:33.906
Where I fell asleep
for 50 years.

1:06:37.618 --> 1:06:38.452
What is that?

1:06:42.498 --> 1:06:43.749
- Huh.

1:06:46.669 --> 1:06:50.506
- Tagimoucia, it means
to cry in your sleep.

1:06:50.506 --> 1:06:52.842
- Tagimoucia.

1:06:52.842 --> 1:06:53.676
- Come on.

1:06:57.930 --> 1:07:01.684
And I woke to the prize
of your glittering eyes.

1:07:01.684 --> 1:07:05.813
- And saw them reflected
where my love forever lies.

1:07:06.981 --> 1:07:08.065
- Reflected.

1:07:09.191 --> 1:07:13.571
- Reflected where
your love forever lies.

1:07:13.571 --> 1:07:16.615
- Colin, Colin, let
me see that journal!

1:07:25.416 --> 1:07:26.208
- What?

1:07:26.208 --> 1:07:27.585
- Come here.

1:07:27.585 --> 1:07:28.878
Look.

1:07:28.878 --> 1:07:32.298
- Oh my gosh.

1:07:33.632 --> 1:07:36.761
- Hold on, let me get a shot
of it.

1:07:39.972 --> 1:07:41.891
- Got it?
- Okay, yeah.

1:07:47.897 --> 1:07:48.898
Be careful.

1:07:48.898 --> 1:07:51.901
Do you feel anything?

1:07:51.901 --> 1:07:53.486
- Wait, I feel something.

1:07:53.486 --> 1:07:54.653
- You do?
- Yeah.

1:08:04.747 --> 1:08:05.831
Alex.

1:08:07.082 --> 1:08:08.584
I think,

1:08:08.584 --> 1:08:11.045
I think we just found it.

1:08:14.757 --> 1:08:17.176
I think we just found it.

1:08:17.176 --> 1:08:22.223
- Open it.

1:08:28.938 --> 1:08:29.772
Yes!

1:08:30.981 --> 1:08:32.817
Ah, it's beautiful.

1:08:35.694 --> 1:08:37.112
- Those worthy of the pearl

1:08:37.112 --> 1:08:38.447
can never have found the pearl.

1:08:38.447 --> 1:08:40.866
- Okay, hold it up. I'm gonna
get a shot with you in it.

1:08:40.866 --> 1:08:42.576
- Hold on, those
worthy of the pearl

1:08:42.576 --> 1:08:44.829
can never have found the pearl.

1:08:44.829 --> 1:08:45.663
- What?

1:08:47.623 --> 1:08:49.458
Colin.
- We can't.

1:08:49.458 --> 1:08:50.292
- Why?

1:08:52.211 --> 1:08:53.879
- We can't
take a picture.

1:08:54.922 --> 1:08:57.591
- But we, we can't rely
just on your writing,

1:08:57.591 --> 1:08:58.592
we have to take--

1:08:58.592 --> 1:08:59.635
- Those worthy of the pearl

1:08:59.635 --> 1:09:01.428
can never have found the pearl.

1:09:01.428 --> 1:09:02.930
We can't have found the pearl.

1:09:04.431 --> 1:09:05.599
- What are you talking about?

1:09:05.599 --> 1:09:06.642
We just found the pearl.

1:09:06.642 --> 1:09:07.726
- I know.

1:09:10.688 --> 1:09:13.816
In order to find the pearl,
you have to have faith

1:09:13.816 --> 1:09:16.944
that the pearl existed, right?

1:09:18.195 --> 1:09:20.322
And if picture's proof,
that's what Akamu

1:09:20.322 --> 1:09:22.324
and Serita were
trying to tell us.

1:09:22.324 --> 1:09:24.159
Proof denies faith.

1:09:26.161 --> 1:09:30.040
And without faith,
I mean the pearl,

1:09:30.040 --> 1:09:31.750
it doesn't mean anything.

1:09:38.507 --> 1:09:40.718
- Yeah, because we
would ruin the legend.

1:09:40.718 --> 1:09:41.802
- Yeah.

1:09:43.012 --> 1:09:45.014
Yeah, if the value of the
pearl is what we accord it,

1:09:45.014 --> 1:09:47.933
so it's a promotion at work
or it's a writing career.

1:09:50.811 --> 1:09:52.730
It's a love that
last a lifetime.

1:09:54.648 --> 1:09:56.525
It's whatever you want it to be.

1:10:01.530 --> 1:10:02.364
- Okay.

1:10:03.741 --> 1:10:04.575
I get it.

1:10:09.538 --> 1:10:12.499
Looking at a pearl in the
museum isn't the same as

1:10:14.668 --> 1:10:16.629
coming out here to
find it for yourself.

1:10:29.058 --> 1:10:29.892
- I'm sorry.

1:10:31.769 --> 1:10:37.024
- I just, I just really wanna
inspire people, you know?

1:10:38.233 --> 1:10:39.693
- You still can.

1:12:06.113 --> 1:12:08.699
Well.

1:12:08.699 --> 1:12:10.159
- Thanks, Malakai.

1:12:16.874 --> 1:12:17.875
- I'll miss you.

1:12:17.875 --> 1:12:20.002
Thank you for everything.

1:12:20.002 --> 1:12:21.503
- Take care, my friends.

1:12:21.503 --> 1:12:24.048
I'm sorry you didn't
find the pearl.

1:12:24.048 --> 1:12:24.923
- Yeah, me too.

1:12:24.923 --> 1:12:25.841
Thanks, Malakai.

1:12:29.845 --> 1:12:31.805
- Well have a safe
flight, Colin.

1:12:35.851 --> 1:12:36.727
- Bye, Alex.

1:12:46.528 --> 1:12:50.657
I know, I know, what would
Blake Montoya do right?

1:12:50.657 --> 1:12:52.618
- No, Colin Page.

1:12:53.535 --> 1:12:54.411
How do you feel?

1:12:56.246 --> 1:12:58.874
- I feel a lot of
things, but, but.

1:12:59.666 --> 1:13:00.876
- You're a writer.

1:13:02.169 --> 1:13:03.253
Do what you do best.

1:13:11.637 --> 1:13:13.639
- Thank you, Malakai.

1:13:13.639 --> 1:13:14.473
Thank you.

1:13:16.767 --> 1:13:18.644
You gave me an idea!

1:13:20.562 --> 1:13:21.772
- Let's go.

1:13:23.565 --> 1:13:24.900
- Hello,
Derek, it's Colin.

1:13:24.900 --> 1:13:26.068
- Hello, Colin?

1:13:26.068 --> 1:13:27.778
- Yeah, hey buddy,
can you hear me?

1:13:27.778 --> 1:13:28.904
I'm back at the hotel now.

1:13:28.904 --> 1:13:29.905
- You keep breaking up.

1:13:29.905 --> 1:13:31.073
- Okay, I'm back at the hotel.

1:13:31.073 --> 1:13:32.574
I think my phone might be wet.

1:13:32.574 --> 1:13:33.575
Anyway, are you there?

1:13:33.575 --> 1:13:35.577
- So did you find the pearl?

1:13:35.577 --> 1:13:36.870
Tell me you found the pearl.

1:13:36.870 --> 1:13:39.873
- No, but I have an amazing
idea for an article.

1:13:39.873 --> 1:13:41.041
- You keep cutting out.

1:13:41.041 --> 1:13:43.585
- I said I have an amazing
idea for an article.

1:13:43.585 --> 1:13:44.920
- So did you find it?

1:13:44.920 --> 1:13:46.171
- Listen, I'm,

1:13:46.171 --> 1:13:48.799
okay listen, I'm gonna
send you an article.

1:13:48.799 --> 1:13:50.425
It's gonna be amazing.

1:13:50.425 --> 1:13:52.469
- Oh, this is great news.

1:13:52.469 --> 1:13:54.471
I'll call the editor
and let her know.

1:13:54.471 --> 1:13:55.556
- Great, thanks, all right.

1:13:55.556 --> 1:13:56.849
Um, I'll send it to you tonight.

1:13:56.849 --> 1:13:57.683
Bye.

1:14:01.645 --> 1:14:04.064
- Sharon, I have
got some great news.

1:14:04.064 --> 1:14:05.607
- They found the pearl?

1:14:05.607 --> 1:14:06.817
- They had to.

1:14:06.817 --> 1:14:09.111
Colin assured me the article
is going to be amazing.

1:14:09.111 --> 1:14:11.196
- We've got our cover story.

1:14:11.196 --> 1:14:12.739
I'll keep an eye out for it.

1:14:48.150 --> 1:14:50.485
- Alex, I
just got the good news

1:14:50.485 --> 1:14:52.863
from Colin's agent that
you guys found the pearl

1:14:52.863 --> 1:14:55.616
and his article will
be submitted tonight!

1:14:55.616 --> 1:14:56.909
Congrats!

1:14:56.909 --> 1:14:58.827
Can't wait to see your photos!

1:14:58.827 --> 1:15:02.080
I'm off to a meeting, but I'll
see you when you get back!

1:15:02.080 --> 1:15:02.915
- What?

1:15:04.666 --> 1:15:05.626
- Hey, Alex.

1:15:06.585 --> 1:15:07.419
Alex?

1:15:08.337 --> 1:15:09.671
- Yes?

1:15:09.671 --> 1:15:10.547
- Oh hi.

1:15:12.132 --> 1:15:14.009
Do you know where the woman
is who's staying in this room?

1:15:14.009 --> 1:15:15.677
- She checked out, sir.

1:15:15.677 --> 1:15:16.678
You just missed her.

1:15:16.678 --> 1:15:17.554
- Thank you.

1:15:18.764 --> 1:15:20.015
Hey, Alex!

1:15:20.015 --> 1:15:22.684
Hey, whoa, hey, hey, hey Alex.

1:15:22.684 --> 1:15:23.644
Are you leaving?

1:15:23.644 --> 1:15:25.062
- I heard you wrote the article.

1:15:25.062 --> 1:15:27.564
- Yeah, yeah, I wanted
to tell you about it.

1:15:27.564 --> 1:15:28.815
- You don't have to do that.

1:15:28.815 --> 1:15:31.818
I talked to my editor,
she told me all about it.

1:15:31.818 --> 1:15:32.945
- She did?

1:15:32.945 --> 1:15:35.530
- Yeah, well played.

1:15:35.530 --> 1:15:38.367
You got your article,
none of the photos.

1:15:38.367 --> 1:15:39.534
- Hold on a second,
let me explain.

1:15:39.534 --> 1:15:40.702
- You know what Colin?

1:15:40.702 --> 1:15:44.289
This is all about you
and selling more books.

1:15:46.875 --> 1:15:47.751
- Alex.

1:15:59.763 --> 1:16:01.807
- Why would he
betray me like this?

1:16:01.807 --> 1:16:03.892
I just, I don't understand.

1:16:03.892 --> 1:16:06.019
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1:16:06.019 --> 1:16:07.396
- You know he's
the one who told me

1:16:07.396 --> 1:16:09.064
to keep it a secret
and to have faith

1:16:09.064 --> 1:16:12.609
and then he just goes
off and does it anyway.

1:16:12.609 --> 1:16:15.529
- Oh, sometimes people aren't
who you think they are.

1:16:15.529 --> 1:16:16.947
- Yeah, tell me about it.

1:16:20.075 --> 1:16:22.744
- Whoa.

1:16:22.744 --> 1:16:24.413
When did you get so organized?

1:16:24.413 --> 1:16:27.207
- I just, I don't understand.

1:16:27.207 --> 1:16:28.333
It doesn't make any sense to me.

1:16:28.333 --> 1:16:31.837
I mean he was so, he
was so fun and smart.

1:16:32.921 --> 1:16:34.506
We make a pretty good team.

1:16:35.549 --> 1:16:36.383
- Make?

1:16:37.676 --> 1:16:39.261
- Hmm?

1:16:39.261 --> 1:16:40.762
- You just said make.

1:16:40.762 --> 1:16:42.055
- I did?
- Uh-huh.

1:16:42.055 --> 1:16:45.183
- Oh I didn't mean that. I
mean made, made a good team.

1:16:54.860 --> 1:16:56.778
- I just read the article.

1:16:56.778 --> 1:16:57.904
Honestly, it's brilliant.

1:16:57.904 --> 1:16:59.698
I'm sending it to the
magazine right now.

1:16:59.698 --> 1:17:00.991
- That is great.

1:17:00.991 --> 1:17:03.660
And hey, you were right,
I was playing it safe

1:17:03.660 --> 1:17:04.786
with my new novel.

1:17:05.954 --> 1:17:09.041
- Oh, is this the same Colin
I meet with a week ago?

1:17:09.041 --> 1:17:11.710
- Let's just say that
I found the inspiration

1:17:11.710 --> 1:17:12.794
I've been missing.

1:17:12.794 --> 1:17:14.004
- Well that's terrific.

1:17:14.004 --> 1:17:17.132
So are you gonna finish
writing Treasures in Taipei?

1:17:17.132 --> 1:17:18.759
- Ah actually, no.

1:17:19.843 --> 1:17:21.720
I gotta a whole new idea.

1:17:53.752 --> 1:17:55.462
- Hey, welcome back.

1:17:56.922 --> 1:18:00.967
- Sharon, I'm, I'm sorry.

1:18:00.967 --> 1:18:03.095
I messed up again.

1:18:03.095 --> 1:18:06.223
And I completely
understand why Ben

1:18:06.890 --> 1:18:08.809
is the better candidate
for this promotion

1:18:08.809 --> 1:18:09.976
and if you wanna fire me--

1:18:09.976 --> 1:18:10.977
- Fire you?

1:18:12.104 --> 1:18:14.481
Why would I wanna fire
my new Creative Director?

1:18:14.481 --> 1:18:15.774
- You're not gonna fire me?

1:18:17.859 --> 1:18:19.027
I'm the new...

1:18:20.153 --> 1:18:22.656
Okay, but I didn't get
any pictures of the pearl.

1:18:22.656 --> 1:18:23.698
- Well, how could you?

1:18:23.698 --> 1:18:24.533
You didn't find it.

1:18:24.533 --> 1:18:25.951
- Well your voicemail.

1:18:25.951 --> 1:18:27.786
- Oh, complete miscommunication.

1:18:27.786 --> 1:18:29.538
Colin's agent thought
he'd found it,

1:18:29.538 --> 1:18:32.332
but turns out it was
bad cell reception.

1:18:32.332 --> 1:18:34.209
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

1:18:34.209 --> 1:18:38.255
What I really need is a photo
of you and Colin together.

1:18:38.255 --> 1:18:39.381
- Us?

1:18:39.381 --> 1:18:40.340
- For the cover.

1:18:41.716 --> 1:18:43.677
You do have some
of those, right?

1:18:43.677 --> 1:18:45.846
- Yeah, yeah, I've got some.

1:18:45.846 --> 1:18:48.974
- This is hands down the best
cover story we've ever done.

1:18:51.643 --> 1:18:52.728
Didn't he send it to you?

1:18:52.728 --> 1:18:54.646
- Uh, no.

1:18:54.646 --> 1:18:56.398
- Well I'm emailing it now.

1:18:56.398 --> 1:18:57.816
You need to read this.

1:19:09.411 --> 1:19:11.204
- In pursuit of a magical pearl

1:19:11.204 --> 1:19:14.583
hidden deep in the lush
rainforests of Viti Levu,

1:19:14.583 --> 1:19:17.127
I found something
completely unexpected.

1:19:18.253 --> 1:19:20.505
- After a
challenging three day hike

1:19:20.505 --> 1:19:23.592
with a charming and brilliant
photographer named Alex,

1:19:23.592 --> 1:19:26.470
and our two guides,
I add my name

1:19:26.470 --> 1:19:29.514
to the long list of
adventurers and lovers

1:19:29.514 --> 1:19:32.225
hoping to lay weary eyes
on a rare blue pearl

1:19:32.225 --> 1:19:33.643
that hundreds of years ago,

1:19:33.643 --> 1:19:36.396
disappeared into the
swirling, stormy sea.

1:19:37.272 --> 1:19:38.899
A pearl that now lies somewhere

1:19:38.899 --> 1:19:41.777
in a sun-kissed valley
paradise waiting to be found.

1:19:43.445 --> 1:19:45.489
Alex and I never
found the pearl.

1:19:46.281 --> 1:19:49.159
But the quest offered us
something more precious.

1:19:50.118 --> 1:19:51.953
It's only when we
open our hearts,

1:19:51.953 --> 1:19:54.039
ready to risk the unknown,

1:19:54.039 --> 1:19:56.208
that life's treasures
reveal themselves.

1:19:56.958 --> 1:20:00.295
And our hearts can love
a thousand times more

1:20:00.295 --> 1:20:01.671
than we ever imagined.

1:20:02.547 --> 1:20:05.550
And if you believe that
there's magic out there,

1:20:06.927 --> 1:20:08.094
it's yours to find.

1:20:08.804 --> 1:20:11.139
Alex knew that all along.

1:20:11.139 --> 1:20:14.559
And she inspired me to go on
a different kind of journey.

1:20:14.559 --> 1:20:17.813
No, I didn't find the
legendary blue pearl,

1:20:17.813 --> 1:20:20.148
but I found out who I want to be

1:20:20.982 --> 1:20:22.484
and who I want to be with.

1:20:23.610 --> 1:20:28.865
And in the end, love is the
greatest adventure of all.

1:20:32.452 --> 1:20:34.621
- Alex, I
have a delivery for you.

1:20:34.621 --> 1:20:35.914
Should I bring them up?

1:20:37.249 --> 1:20:38.208
- Yeah, thank you.

1:20:48.009 --> 1:20:49.636
- Hello?

1:20:49.636 --> 1:20:50.637
- Hi.

1:20:50.637 --> 1:20:51.513
- Hey Alex.

1:20:51.513 --> 1:20:53.265
It's nice hearing your voice.

1:20:54.599 --> 1:20:56.017
- I read your article.

1:20:56.017 --> 1:20:58.061
- Yeah and what did
you think of it?

1:20:59.688 --> 1:21:02.607
- Well, some of the
technical details

1:21:02.607 --> 1:21:03.733
didn't ring so true for me.

1:21:03.733 --> 1:21:04.651
- Ha, ha, ha.

1:21:08.446 --> 1:21:09.573
You're a funny girl.

1:21:12.450 --> 1:21:14.661
Some conversations are
better had in person

1:21:14.661 --> 1:21:17.330
than well, with flowers.

1:21:18.582 --> 1:21:20.709
- Did you mean everything
you said in that article?

1:21:20.709 --> 1:21:24.337
- Alex, I'm standing
in your office

1:21:24.337 --> 1:21:27.382
with rare flowers from Fiji,

1:21:27.382 --> 1:21:30.635
which I think officially makes
me a international smuggler.

1:21:33.013 --> 1:21:33.930
Yes.

1:21:35.432 --> 1:21:37.392
I meant every single word.

1:21:46.943 --> 1:21:48.862
- I just want you to
know that sometimes

1:21:48.862 --> 1:21:50.113
I'm not organized.

1:21:50.113 --> 1:21:51.197
- I like that.

1:21:51.197 --> 1:21:54.451
- And I don't ever,
ever wanna make a list.

1:21:54.451 --> 1:21:55.285
- Check.

1:21:56.036 --> 1:21:57.120
- And I don't like tea.

1:21:57.120 --> 1:21:59.581
- Ooh, all right, we're
working on that one.

1:21:59.581 --> 1:22:01.291
- And--
- And?

1:22:01.291 --> 1:22:03.209
- In the legend, it
says that only true love

1:22:03.209 --> 1:22:05.587
can find the pearl
and in your article,

1:22:05.587 --> 1:22:06.671
you said we didn't.

1:22:08.632 --> 1:22:09.716
- Hold on.

1:22:17.724 --> 1:22:19.809
It's not the blue pearl.

1:22:20.769 --> 1:22:21.686
But it's ours.

1:22:31.696 --> 1:22:35.158
That's that.

1:22:35.158 --> 1:22:38.620
- It's the most beautiful
pearl I have ever seen.

1:22:38.620 --> 1:22:41.039
- No, you are.

1:22:59.808 --> 1:23:00.850
Come on.

1:23:00.850 --> 1:23:02.727
Hurry up, I'm dying
to explore the reef.

1:23:02.727 --> 1:23:04.729
- Okay, okay, I just
wanna finish this chapter.

1:23:04.729 --> 1:23:07.107
- You know I could tell
you how it ends, right?

1:23:09.818 --> 1:23:11.444
- Don't you dare.

1:23:15.990 --> 1:23:16.825
- Come on.
