00:22.648 --> 00:24.942
<i>Just like the way Doug unplugs</i>

00:28.862 --> 00:32.491
<i>Dashing through Mega City On a cold and snowy day</i>

00:32.573 --> 00:34.243
<i>Wishing all my friends</i>

00:34.326 --> 00:35.702
Like you, Miss Molly.

00:35.786 --> 00:36.870

00:36.954 --> 00:39.414
<i>Snowflakes are cold and fluffy</i>

00:39.498 --> 00:40.958
<i>It's sparkly everywhere</i>

00:41.625 --> 00:44.962
<i>Oh, what fun it is to sing About my favorite time of year</i>

00:45.045 --> 00:49.341
<i>Oh, happy, happy, happy Happy, happy holidays</i>

00:49.424 --> 00:52.803
<i>Oh, what fun it is to wish the bots</i>

00:52.886 --> 00:57.349
<i>A very big happy holiday</i>

00:58.016 --> 00:59.518
Hum-bot.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.228
-Hum-bot. -Hum-bot.

01:01.311 --> 01:03.021
Hum-bot.

01:03.105 --> 01:04.438
Hey, Emma.

01:05.022 --> 01:08.026
"Hey, Emma"? Is that all you got?

01:08.110 --> 01:11.738
Doug, it's the hap-hap-happiest time of the year.

01:12.614 --> 01:14.074
Why so blue, botty-buddy?

01:14.157 --> 01:17.327
Sorry, Emma. Bots don't process well when we're not busy.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.121
-Hum-bot. -Hum-bot.

01:19.204 --> 01:21.582
It always happens this time of year.

01:21.665 --> 01:26.253
We're really busy, and then all of a sudden, it just stops.

01:26.336 --> 01:27.629
Hum-bot.

01:27.713 --> 01:33.135
Delivery? Delivery? Doesn't anybody need a delivery?

01:33.218 --> 01:36.930
We don't know why, Emma, but humans just stop ordering things.

01:37.014 --> 01:39.766
So I've got nothing to deliver or pick up.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.436
Maybe I'll check again.

01:42.519 --> 01:45.189
All of our processors are on pause.

01:45.272 --> 01:48.025
And that's why we call this time of year…

01:48.734 --> 01:50.402
Hum-bot.

01:51.069 --> 01:55.199
Hum-bot? But, bots, that's what's supposed to happen.

01:55.282 --> 01:58.368
This is the time of year when everybody stops working

01:58.452 --> 02:04.416
and celebrates the holidays. Yeah!

02:07.085 --> 02:08.503
What's a holiday, Emma?

02:08.586 --> 02:10.172
"What's a holiday?"

02:10.255 --> 02:13.717
Well, jingle my bells, Doug. Plug in and find out.

02:18.805 --> 02:22.976
<i>I feel it coming again It's not much longer now</i>

02:24.061 --> 02:27.981
<i>Can't wait for family and friends To arrive from out of town</i>

02:28.982 --> 02:33.820
<i>Making plans to get together Taking time off to remember</i>

02:33.904 --> 02:38.075
<i>Keeping our traditions alive Alive</i>

02:39.159 --> 02:42.663
<i>We'll have so many good times</i>

02:43.247 --> 02:48.210
<i>The holidays are here</i>

02:48.293 --> 02:53.131
<i>We've waited a whole year</i>

02:53.215 --> 02:58.095
<i>We'll light up the house and decorate All here together to celebrate</i>

02:58.178 --> 03:04.476
<i>The holidays are here The holidays</i>

03:05.644 --> 03:09.773
I see. A holiday is a day to celebrate a tradition or an event.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.900
But I still have a big question.

03:11.984 --> 03:14.194
What makes the holidays so special?

03:14.278 --> 03:18.699
Just… everything.

03:18.782 --> 03:21.451
Lucky for you, tonight is Christmas Eve.

03:21.535 --> 03:24.246
My favorite night ever.

03:24.329 --> 03:27.708
Doug, you need to unplug and come over to my house

03:27.791 --> 03:31.753
so you'll see that the holidays are anything but hum-bot.

03:31.837 --> 03:34.131
Can I go, Mom and Dad? Please?

03:35.591 --> 03:37.301
Of course, son.

03:37.384 --> 03:41.180
But wait just a nanosecond. What's this?

03:42.723 --> 03:46.310
It's snowing, which means it's cold and wet

03:46.393 --> 03:49.146
and very hard to get around.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.857
Oh, no. But how will I get home?

03:51.940 --> 03:55.027
It's Christmas Eve. The night we decorate the tree

03:55.110 --> 03:58.906
and eat cheesy artichoke dip and sing Christmas carols.

03:58.989 --> 04:00.407
I can't miss it.

04:00.490 --> 04:04.536
I don't want to miss my chance to find out what makes the holidays so special.

04:04.620 --> 04:06.622
Settle your sensors, kids.

04:06.705 --> 04:10.459
I think I have just the thing to help get you to Emma's.

04:11.668 --> 04:14.046
Everybotty, meet Sleigh Bot.

04:15.464 --> 04:17.007
Hi, everybotty.

04:17.089 --> 04:19.091
-Hi. -Nice to meet you, Sleigh Bot.

04:19.676 --> 04:22.387
She's the latest in snow travel technology.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.307
Her roomy, open-air design

04:25.390 --> 04:28.852
allows for the optimal chilly weather travel experience.

04:32.064 --> 04:33.857
"Whoa" is right.

04:33.941 --> 04:36.652
I cannot get over how well designed I am.

04:37.152 --> 04:38.445
Thank you, Sleigh Bot.

04:38.529 --> 04:42.533
Wow, with Sleigh Bot, we'll get to your house in no time, Emma.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.159
So, these are my seat warmers?

04:44.243 --> 04:46.620
And these are my-- What are they called?

04:46.703 --> 04:49.873
-Headlights and rudders. -Headlights and rudders?

04:50.666 --> 04:54.711
I don't know what they're for, but I'm sure glad I got 'em.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.214
Mrs. Bot, this sleigh is amazing.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.298
Thanks, Mom.

04:59.091 --> 05:01.802
These seat warmers are nice.

05:01.885 --> 05:03.804
Grab hold of your gears, Doug,

05:03.887 --> 05:07.015
'cause there's no place like my home for the holiday.

05:07.099 --> 05:10.394
-Here we go! -Be careful.

05:10.477 --> 05:12.312
It's a real hum-bot out there.

05:16.191 --> 05:18.193
-Yeah! -Sleigh ride!

05:18.277 --> 05:20.445
Is this snow?

05:20.529 --> 05:24.616
Sensors indicate it's cold and wet and white, and I love it!

05:29.746 --> 05:32.457
And look, there's more snow, and more snow over there, and--

05:32.541 --> 05:35.127
Wait, why is snow everywhere?

05:35.210 --> 05:37.963
Because it's snowing, Sleigh Bot.

05:38.630 --> 05:41.216
Now, that makes some amazing sense.

05:44.595 --> 05:45.804
Wow!

05:57.399 --> 05:59.651
Look, you can even make pictures in it.

06:05.115 --> 06:07.534
Hold on, my shiny friends.

06:11.747 --> 06:14.625
Uh-oh, Emma, look. I think we have a malfunction.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.628
A malfunction? That sounds good.

06:17.711 --> 06:18.795
Is it good?

06:18.879 --> 06:20.339
It's not good, Sleigh Bot.

06:20.422 --> 06:22.341
It means your rudder is broken.

06:22.424 --> 06:24.968
And you need both rudders to ride through the snow.

06:25.052 --> 06:27.763
Doug, we have to fix it so we can get home.

06:27.846 --> 06:30.557
I can't miss my family's holiday traditions.

06:32.226 --> 06:35.187
My sensors detect sound coming from that house.

06:36.104 --> 06:37.564
Wait, isn't that…

06:38.106 --> 06:39.858
Hi, I'm Gary.

06:40.442 --> 06:42.903
We know, Gary. We've met you before.

06:42.986 --> 06:46.073
Oh, yeah. Hi, Doug and Emma. What brings you here?

06:46.156 --> 06:50.118
Our sleigh had a malfunction. We were wondering if you might be able to help us.

06:50.202 --> 06:53.372
Hi, kids. Let's see what we can do. Come in, come in.

06:57.668 --> 06:58.710
Hi there.

06:58.794 --> 07:00.712
Wanna spin in the snow with me?

07:03.674 --> 07:09.137
I'll take that as a yes! Snow is the greatest.

07:09.221 --> 07:12.140
We were just gonna make our traditional centerpiece.

07:12.224 --> 07:14.518
It's a very important part of Kwanzaa.

07:15.435 --> 07:19.189
Kwanzaa! I love Kwanzaa.

07:19.273 --> 07:20.399
Kwanzaa?

07:20.482 --> 07:23.485
I don't have that word in my data banks. What is it?

07:23.569 --> 07:26.738
It's a holiday that celebrates African heritage in America.

07:26.822 --> 07:29.366
A holiday? Emma, did you hear that?

07:29.449 --> 07:32.077
It's not the only thing I hear, my shiny pal.

07:33.287 --> 07:35.789
That's my dad playing the djembe, his drum.

07:35.873 --> 07:39.126
Our Kwanzaa celebration wouldn't feel right without music.

07:39.209 --> 07:40.210
Wanna try?

07:40.294 --> 07:41.420
Affirmative.

07:41.503 --> 07:42.796
I know.

07:42.880 --> 07:44.214
I'll record a sample.

07:46.925 --> 07:50.345
Then input the sound into my data banks and…

07:53.640 --> 07:56.435
I like the sound of that, my new robot friend.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.189
Now come on, everyone.

08:00.272 --> 08:02.941
-Feel the rhythm of Kwanzaa. -Yeah!

08:03.984 --> 08:06.361
I can feel it too! Can you feel it?

08:07.446 --> 08:09.990
We can feel it!

08:10.073 --> 08:11.909
Who wants to help make the centerpiece?

08:11.992 --> 08:13.285
I sure do!

08:13.368 --> 08:14.369
How do we do that?

08:14.453 --> 08:15.913
Just follow Gary.

08:20.417 --> 08:24.171
<i>We set the table First the cloth, then a mat</i>

08:24.254 --> 08:28.383
<i>A kinara, seven candles Three red, three green, one black</i>

08:28.467 --> 08:32.554
<i>There's bowls of fruits and veggies Arranged in pretty ways</i>

08:32.638 --> 08:36.350
<i>We'll meet here with the family Each day for seven days</i>

08:36.433 --> 08:39.977
-<i>To celebrate Kwanzaa</i> -<i>Kwanzaa</i>

08:41.480 --> 08:42.856
<i>Hey!</i>

08:42.940 --> 08:46.068
<i>Kwanzaa Hey!</i>

08:47.319 --> 08:51.865
<i>Kwanzaa</i>

08:51.949 --> 08:54.910
<i>To celebrate Kwanzaa</i>

08:55.953 --> 08:58.872
My family plays music to celebrate the holidays too.

08:59.665 --> 09:02.292
Which reminds me. If we don't get going,

09:02.376 --> 09:04.628
we might miss Christmas Eve at my house.

09:04.711 --> 09:07.756
But, Emma, we can't go anywhere with Sleigh Bot's broken rudder.

09:07.840 --> 09:09.758
A broken rudder, huh?

09:10.509 --> 09:11.760
Here you go, kids.

09:11.844 --> 09:14.304
Maybe you could put these skis to good use.

09:14.388 --> 09:16.306
Wow. Really? We can have them?

09:16.390 --> 09:18.767
Of course. Call it a Kwanzaa gift.

09:18.851 --> 09:21.436
You just saved my holiday, Gary's Mom.

09:21.520 --> 09:22.646
Thanks.

09:23.438 --> 09:24.898
-Happy Kwanzaa! -Happy Kwanzaa!

09:24.982 --> 09:26.441
-Happy Kwanzaa! -Happy Kwanzaa!

09:28.944 --> 09:30.654
That was bot-tastic, Emma.

09:30.737 --> 09:34.825
And now I know what makes the holidays so special is music.

09:34.908 --> 09:37.494
True. That's a part of it, Doug.

09:37.578 --> 09:40.455
But there's so much more to the holidays than that.

09:40.539 --> 09:42.332
Really? Like what?

09:42.416 --> 09:46.336
Well, it's-- Wait.

09:46.420 --> 09:48.005
Where'd Sleigh Bot go?

09:48.088 --> 09:49.590
Surprise!

09:51.800 --> 09:53.427
Gotcha!

09:53.510 --> 09:54.887
Snow is the greatest.

09:55.804 --> 09:57.764
Let's get you fixed up.

09:57.848 --> 09:59.683
Hold still, Sleigh Bot.

10:02.394 --> 10:04.897
These rebooted rudders are perfect.

10:04.980 --> 10:06.607
Thank you, Doug.

10:06.690 --> 10:08.609
I feel like a brand-new bot.

10:08.692 --> 10:11.528
Which I basically am!

10:12.446 --> 10:15.032
The celebration has just begun.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.575
My shiny friends,

10:16.658 --> 10:21.747
buckle up for more holiday awesomeness at the Pines!

10:32.090 --> 10:33.800
Sharpen those sensors, drones.

10:33.884 --> 10:37.012
There's just gotta be some reboot bins around here to pick up.

10:40.641 --> 10:43.435
Please be full. And…

10:46.355 --> 10:49.441
Empty? No.

10:49.525 --> 10:50.859
Hum-bot.

10:53.403 --> 10:57.407
<i>Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way</i>

10:57.491 --> 11:01.870
<i>Oh, what fun it is to ride On a one-horse open sleigh</i>

11:01.954 --> 11:04.998
Bot! See what I did there?

11:05.082 --> 11:07.376
No, I did not. In fact…

11:08.627 --> 11:10.295
I can't see anything!

11:10.379 --> 11:13.006
Quick, Sleigh Bot, switch your headlights back on!

11:13.090 --> 11:15.342
Sorry, new best friend, Doug. I can't.

11:15.425 --> 11:18.095
I think they're broken. But isn't this fun?

11:19.680 --> 11:21.348
Look out, look out!

11:25.519 --> 11:28.522
Uh-oh, Emma. Bot sensors need light to detect a path.

11:28.605 --> 11:30.232
We can't keep going in the dark.

11:30.315 --> 11:33.360
And my flashlight eyes aren't strong enough to be headlights.

11:33.443 --> 11:37.281
Then how are we ever gonna get to the celebration at my house?

11:37.364 --> 11:38.907
What are we gonna do?

11:38.991 --> 11:43.287
We're trapped in darkness!

11:43.370 --> 11:45.789
-Hi, Emma. Hi, Doug. -Thomas?

11:45.873 --> 11:47.457
What are you doing here?

11:47.541 --> 11:49.334
I'm visiting my grandparents.

11:49.418 --> 11:52.045
And I saw you go by. Is everything okay?

11:52.129 --> 11:54.756
No. We're trying to get to Emma's house,

11:54.840 --> 11:58.051
but our sleigh encountered another malfunction.

11:58.135 --> 12:01.972
Hi there. I'm the sleigh that encountered another malfunction.

12:02.764 --> 12:05.809
Nice meeting you, talking sleigh.

12:06.727 --> 12:08.061
Her name's Sleigh Bot.

12:08.145 --> 12:11.648
Thomas, do you think your grandparents could help us fix her broken headlights?

12:11.732 --> 12:13.400
We can ask. Come inside.

12:18.030 --> 12:19.656
Hey, look, Emma.

12:19.740 --> 12:23.202
Thomas has a candlestick kind of like the one we saw at Gary's house.

12:23.285 --> 12:24.912
That's actually a menorah.

12:24.995 --> 12:28.498
We light a candle on it every night for eight nights.

12:28.582 --> 12:30.501
It's part of our Hanukkah tradition.

12:30.584 --> 12:31.960
Hanukkah is a holiday.

12:32.044 --> 12:33.795
Another holiday?

12:33.879 --> 12:35.464
Pretty sweet, huh, Doug?

12:35.547 --> 12:37.633
Told you it's my favorite time of the year.

12:37.716 --> 12:41.261
Well, well. Who are our visitors, Thomas?

12:41.345 --> 12:43.305
Grandpa, this is Doug and Emma.

12:43.388 --> 12:45.891
They need to fix the headlight on their sleigh.

12:45.974 --> 12:47.059
Headlight, huh?

12:47.142 --> 12:49.436
Then I think you came to the right place.

12:49.520 --> 12:53.398
Did you know Hanukkah is called "the Festival of Lights"?

12:53.482 --> 12:57.152
It's a Jewish holiday that's celebrated for eight days.

12:57.236 --> 12:58.362
Really?

12:58.445 --> 12:59.530
Eight days?

12:59.613 --> 13:02.491
But speaking of light, did Thomas tell you?

13:02.574 --> 13:05.619
You're just in time to help us light the menorah.

13:05.702 --> 13:08.705
My darling, we have company.

13:08.789 --> 13:12.334
Welcome, welcome, everyone. Happy Hanukkah.

13:12.417 --> 13:15.796
Thomas's friends are gonna help us light the menorah.

13:16.380 --> 13:19.299
How wonderful. There'll be even more of us.

13:19.800 --> 13:24.388
You'll get to see all of Thomas's aunts and uncles and cousins.

13:24.471 --> 13:28.767
Just as soon as we're all hooked up on this computer. Let's see.

13:30.435 --> 13:31.937
<i>Thomas! Happy Hanukkah.</i>

13:32.020 --> 13:33.522
-<i>Good to see you.</i> -<i>Hello!</i>

13:33.605 --> 13:37.067
-Hello, friends and family! -<i>Chag Sameach,</i> everyone.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.945
Okay, family and friends and robot friends.

13:40.028 --> 13:41.947
Ready to light the menorah?

13:42.030 --> 13:43.073
-<i>Let's do it!</i> -<i>Ready!</i>

13:45.367 --> 13:48.412
<i>There's a candle to light For each of Hanukkah's nights</i>

13:48.495 --> 13:52.499
<i>We use the shammes in the center The helper</i>

13:52.583 --> 13:56.420
<i>It shares its flame from left to right</i>

13:59.089 --> 14:02.885
<i>All around the world Windows flickering bright</i>

14:02.968 --> 14:06.680
<i>Candles shine for each of Hanukkah's nights</i>

14:06.763 --> 14:13.020
<i>The sun is down But it's warm inside</i>

14:13.103 --> 14:15.981
<i>Tomorrow The whole menorah</i>

14:16.064 --> 14:17.691
<i>Will be alight</i>

14:20.861 --> 14:22.863
That was beautiful.

14:22.946 --> 14:27.451
And we'll all join together tomorrow to light our last Hanukkah candle.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.411
-Bye. Enjoy your dinner. -Bye, everybody.

14:29.494 --> 14:31.079
-<i>See you later!</i> -<i>Good night.</i>

14:31.163 --> 14:32.289
Bye, everybody.

14:33.123 --> 14:34.249
<i>Is that a robot?</i>

14:34.917 --> 14:37.461
And now that we have lit the menorah,

14:37.544 --> 14:40.714
won't you join us for some latkes? We have plenty.

14:40.797 --> 14:43.008
Well, that sounds…

14:45.260 --> 14:47.679
And smells delicious.

14:47.763 --> 14:52.100
But there's a cheesy bowl of artichoke dip at home with my name on it.

14:52.184 --> 14:55.938
Well, in that case, take these flashlights for your sleigh.

14:56.021 --> 14:58.065
I hope they'll light your way.

14:58.148 --> 14:59.900
-Perfect. Thank you. -Thank you.

15:00.776 --> 15:04.029
Hurry, Doug. Christmas Eve awaits.

15:04.112 --> 15:06.907
Plus, I finally know what makes holidays so special.

15:06.990 --> 15:10.118
Holidays are all about music and traditions.

15:10.202 --> 15:12.079
Like lighting candles with your family.

15:12.162 --> 15:16.542
Well, both those things are important and wonderful, Doug,

15:17.334 --> 15:20.212
but there's still so much more than that.

15:21.463 --> 15:24.258
But don't worry, my best bot, you'll get it.

15:24.341 --> 15:26.552
We're not done celebrating yet.

15:32.391 --> 15:34.601
There. Now Sleigh Bot can see again.

15:35.727 --> 15:37.396
Loving the rebooted headlights.

15:37.479 --> 15:39.940
Now hold on, new best friends!

15:40.023 --> 15:41.650
To Christmas Eve.

15:42.776 --> 15:45.153
Oh, yeah!

15:45.237 --> 15:46.488
Oh, yeah!

15:47.489 --> 15:49.074
That was a lot of slush.

15:49.157 --> 15:51.076
And it's in my engine.

15:54.121 --> 15:55.247
New friends.

15:55.330 --> 15:59.042
I think I may have had another one of those malfunction things you don't like.

15:59.126 --> 16:01.461
Uh-oh. Sleigh Bot's engine isn't working.

16:01.545 --> 16:03.755
Oh, no. What are we gonna do?

16:03.839 --> 16:05.632
Oh, Doug, Doug, Doug, Doug.

16:05.716 --> 16:09.428
We're stuck in the middle of this field, and no one's around.

16:09.511 --> 16:11.597
How are we gonna get home now?

16:12.598 --> 16:16.310
I can't believe we're gonna miss Christmas Eve!

16:16.393 --> 16:17.769
Is that Emma?

16:19.354 --> 16:21.064
Emma!

16:21.148 --> 16:22.149
Jenny!

16:22.232 --> 16:25.903
It's a holiday miracle!

16:26.570 --> 16:29.448
Jenny. Great gears, are we glad to see you.

16:29.531 --> 16:32.826
Sleigh Bot's engine isn't working. We can't get to Emma's.

16:32.910 --> 16:35.120
Then we'll give you a lift, Doug-o.

16:35.204 --> 16:37.789
We've been looking for something to deliver.

16:37.873 --> 16:39.249
All right, drones.

16:40.417 --> 16:41.585
Let's zoom.

16:43.462 --> 16:46.840
I didn't know I was programmed to fly!

16:47.799 --> 16:49.051
What you doing, girls?

16:49.134 --> 16:51.470
Waiting for Santa.

16:51.553 --> 16:53.180
He's bringing presents.

16:53.972 --> 16:57.059
I hope he brings me that new karaoke machine.

16:57.142 --> 17:00.103
I have been a very good actor this year.

17:00.187 --> 17:02.731
Now, girls, and Laurence,

17:02.814 --> 17:05.108
you know Santa can't come until Emma's here.

17:05.192 --> 17:09.695
Really? But, Mommy, he's here now.

17:09.780 --> 17:11.990
Look, it's Santa's sleigh.

17:14.117 --> 17:20.624
<i>Oh, what fun it is to ride On a three-drone open sleigh</i>

17:20.707 --> 17:21.708
-Bot. -Bot.

17:23.252 --> 17:26.255
Sweet snickerdoodles. It's Emma-bean!

17:26.338 --> 17:29.883
-Honey. It's so good to see you. -Mom, Dad! Tabatha, Agatha!

17:29.967 --> 17:34.388
Did I miss it? Did I miss all our Christmas Eve traditions?

17:34.471 --> 17:37.432
Is there any cheesy artichoke dip left?

17:39.852 --> 17:41.270
Why is everyone looking at me?

17:42.437 --> 17:45.858
Oh, sweetie. We'd never start Christmas without you.

17:45.941 --> 17:48.443
Come on inside the house, and let's warm up, everyone.

17:50.279 --> 17:51.363
You too…

17:52.114 --> 17:57.077
Sleigh Bot. And thanks. I would of course love to!

17:57.578 --> 17:59.246
A holiday headband for you.

18:00.163 --> 18:02.249
This accessory does not compute.

18:02.332 --> 18:04.877
Sensors indicate we look ridiculous.

18:04.960 --> 18:08.589
Sorry, bots, but if you're gonna do Christmas Eve with the Pines,

18:08.672 --> 18:11.592
you've gotta get your Christmas silly on.

18:12.426 --> 18:15.179
Emma, why is there a tree inside your house?

18:15.679 --> 18:17.890
Doug. That's not just any tree.

18:17.973 --> 18:20.100
That's a Christmas tree.

18:20.184 --> 18:25.105
And not just any Christmas tree. A pine tree.

18:25.189 --> 18:26.440
Get it?

18:26.523 --> 18:30.068
'Cause we're the Pine family, and the tree family is also pine.

18:31.195 --> 18:33.864
I love getting my Christmas silly on.

18:35.032 --> 18:40.370
Mom, Dad. Doug wants to find out what makes holidays so special.

18:40.454 --> 18:44.833
And I knew all he needed was a little Christmas to figure it out.

18:44.917 --> 18:46.627
A festive idea, Emma.

18:46.710 --> 18:50.005
Let's kick off this Pine family Christmas with a carol.

18:54.718 --> 18:57.387
<i>Tonight's the night Pine family Christmas</i>

18:57.471 --> 18:59.848
<i>Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la</i>

18:59.932 --> 19:02.142
<i>We're happy that The bots could join us</i>

19:02.226 --> 19:04.186
<i>Fa-la-la-la-la La-la-la-la</i>

19:04.269 --> 19:06.772
<i>A somersault With big excitement</i>

19:09.233 --> 19:11.985
<i>Show my best bot how we light up</i>

19:12.069 --> 19:14.029
Hey, I light up too!

19:15.447 --> 19:21.954
<i>Fa-la-la-la-la La-la-la-la</i>

19:22.037 --> 19:26.250
There. Now all we have to do is wait for Santa to come.

19:26.333 --> 19:29.378
-Santa? -Santa? Who's that, Emma?

19:29.461 --> 19:31.713
"Who's Santa?"

19:31.797 --> 19:35.425
Oh, my. Oh, boy. Oh, wow. Oh, jeez. Oh, dear. Oh, Doug.

19:35.509 --> 19:38.804
Of all your questions, this one takes the fruitcake.

19:38.887 --> 19:40.722
-Look, Doug. -Look.

19:40.806 --> 19:41.807
Check it out.

19:41.890 --> 19:45.936
Santa Claus delivers presents all over the world on Christmas Eve.

19:46.019 --> 19:47.521
On his sleigh.

19:47.604 --> 19:50.065
On his sleigh?

19:50.148 --> 19:52.609
That guy is my hero.

19:52.693 --> 19:53.694
Wow, Emma.

19:53.777 --> 19:56.613
Tonight I got to learn a lot about different holidays.

19:57.281 --> 20:00.659
Like Kwanzaa, Hanukkah and Christmas.

20:00.742 --> 20:04.538
And I discovered the things that make each holiday special.

20:04.621 --> 20:09.293
Like music, candles, singing and spending time with family.

20:09.918 --> 20:14.548
Just thinking about it all makes my sensors experience a strange sensation.

20:14.631 --> 20:17.801
I feel all warm and fuzzy.

20:17.885 --> 20:19.011
Doug, that's it.

20:19.094 --> 20:21.847
That's what I've been trying to put my finger on.

20:21.930 --> 20:25.851
You figured out what makes holidays so special.

20:25.934 --> 20:28.645
It's the special way they make you feel inside.

20:28.729 --> 20:31.982
That warm and fuzzy feeling.

20:32.065 --> 20:34.610
It's the holiday spirit.

20:36.737 --> 20:38.030
That gives me an idea.

20:38.113 --> 20:41.575
Bots, we should bring the holiday spirit to Rebots.

20:42.201 --> 20:44.244
Come on, Team Warm and Fuzzy.

20:44.328 --> 20:48.498
Let's dash away, dash away, dash away to Rebots!

20:48.582 --> 20:50.250
Happy holidays!

20:53.420 --> 20:56.048
<i>Deck Rebots with flashing sensors</i>

20:56.131 --> 20:58.592
<i>Beep-beep-beep-beep-boop Beep-beep-bop-boop</i>

20:58.675 --> 21:00.886
<i>'Tis the season to fill database</i>

21:00.969 --> 21:03.514
<i>Beep-beep-beep-beep-boop</i>

21:03.597 --> 21:06.225
<i>Don we now Our shiny gears</i>

21:06.308 --> 21:08.810
<i>Beep-beep-bop Beep-beep-bop, boop-boop-boop</i>

21:08.894 --> 21:11.605
<i>While we process holiday cheer</i>

21:11.688 --> 21:13.941
<i>Beep-beep-beep-beep-boop Beep-boop-bop-boop</i>

21:14.024 --> 21:16.860
Doug? What is that sound you're making?

21:16.944 --> 21:20.405
We're singing. It's what some humans do during the holidays.

21:20.489 --> 21:24.409
And I figured if we bots can't be busy this time of year…

21:24.493 --> 21:25.827
Hum-bot!

21:25.911 --> 21:27.704
Then let's make it into a good thing.

21:27.788 --> 21:30.165
We can celebrate our own robot holiday.

21:30.249 --> 21:32.042
Come on, everybotty.

21:32.125 --> 21:34.795
Let's give this place a holiday reboot.

21:38.465 --> 21:40.384
Wow.

21:40.467 --> 21:46.223
All of this holiday is giving me a strange sense in my processors.

21:46.306 --> 21:50.185
Me too. My gears, they're warm, and-- Is that fuzzy?

21:51.562 --> 21:54.189
My sensors indicate joy.

21:54.273 --> 21:56.149
That's the holiday spirit,

21:56.233 --> 21:59.528
and we can feel it every year when we celebrate our own holiday.

21:59.611 --> 22:01.321
What a great idea.

22:01.405 --> 22:02.823
Hum-bot!

22:02.906 --> 22:05.659
But, Dad, I thought you liked our new holiday.

22:05.742 --> 22:07.286
I do, son.

22:07.369 --> 22:12.040
That's why I'm saying "hum-bot" in a whole new, very, very merry way.

22:12.124 --> 22:15.252
Hum-bot is now our favorite time of the year.

22:15.335 --> 22:19.381
Then that's what we'll call our new robot holiday. Hum-bot!

22:19.464 --> 22:22.551
<i>Don we now our shiny gears Beep-beep-bop</i>

22:22.634 --> 22:24.553
<i>Beep-beep-bop Boop-boop-boop</i>

22:24.636 --> 22:27.181
<i>While we process Hum-bot cheer</i>

22:27.264 --> 22:29.224
<i>Beep-beep-beep-beep-boop</i>

22:29.308 --> 22:32.352
<i>Beep-boop-bop-boop</i>

22:32.436 --> 22:34.479
Have a warm and fuzzy Hum-bot, everybody.

22:36.356 --> 22:40.527
<i>The holidays are here</i>

22:45.866 --> 22:50.454
<i>We've waited a whole year</i>

22:55.751 --> 23:01.882
<i>The holidays are here The holidays</i>
