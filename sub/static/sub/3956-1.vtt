Dear Diary, in a city far from home
Rachel Earl was running.

00:22.079 --> 00:23.879
Yes, that's right, running.

00:23.879 --> 00:27.038
And a running Rae Earl is not
something you see very often,

00:27.039 --> 00:28.918
but this was an emergency.

00:28.919 --> 00:31.519
Even if Johnny Depp was beckoning me
from the top of the hill

00:31.520 --> 00:33.798
with his penis, it would
have to wait.

00:33.799 --> 00:35.159
Sorry, Johnny.

00:35.159 --> 00:39.079
I was late.

01:03.239 --> 01:05.679
Hiya.

01:05.679 --> 01:08.358
You'll have read Hamlet,
is that correct?

01:08.359 --> 01:10.958
Oh, actually, we're doing Macbeth.

01:10.959 --> 01:13.078
So you'll have read Hamlet.

01:13.079 --> 01:15.918
I've seen the film.

01:15.919 --> 01:17.478
The film?

01:17.479 --> 01:20.518
With Mel Gibson.

01:20.519 --> 01:22.998
Where are you studying, Rachel?

01:22.999 --> 01:25.159
It's called Stamford City College.

01:25.159 --> 01:26.958
Your other A levels being...?

01:26.959 --> 01:30.678
Sociology and Performing Arts.

01:30.679 --> 01:33.438
Just those?

01:33.439 --> 01:35.878
Just those.

01:35.879 --> 01:39.879
Well, then, that should afford you
plenty of time for extra reading.

01:41.239 --> 01:45.239
Or watching films.

01:48.799 --> 01:50.278
It's all right for you, isn't it?

01:50.279 --> 01:51.398
Excuse me?

01:51.399 --> 01:53.598
I'm just saying,
it's all right for you.

01:53.599 --> 01:56.718
I'm sure YOU'VE got plenty
of time for extra reading,

01:56.719 --> 01:59.478
but I live in the real world...

01:59.479 --> 02:01.518
..and sometimes in the real world,

02:01.519 --> 02:05.519
real life gets in the way
of extra reading.

02:05.559 --> 02:08.717
Look, I'm sorry
that I haven't read Hamlet.

02:08.719 --> 02:11.278
I love Shakespeare, I do,

02:11.279 --> 02:13.718
but Shakespeare doesn't change
my baby sister's nappies

02:13.719 --> 02:15.358
in the middle of the night,

02:15.359 --> 02:18.718
Shakespeare doesn't turn the light
on when I'm having a nightmare

02:18.719 --> 02:22.558
and Shakespeare, sure as shit,
never gets his round in -

02:22.559 --> 02:25.718
at least not in my local.

02:25.719 --> 02:29.719
From what I can tell from the film,
Hamlet is a tragedy of indecision.

02:30.679 --> 02:34.679
It's one of the few mental health
problems I don't suffer with.

02:35.119 --> 02:39.119
It's a shame you're not as cool
as the city that you work in.

02:39.439 --> 02:43.439
And that, ladies and gentlemen...

02:47.999 --> 02:50.438
And that, ladies and gentlemen,

02:50.439 --> 02:53.958
is how you fuck up
a university interview.

02:53.959 --> 02:57.719
But this - pretty much everything
I'm about to tell you -

02:57.720 --> 03:01.059
was why it didn't
matter in the slightest.

03:01.114 --> 03:33.042
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

03:39.999 --> 03:41.999
This was the year of A levels.

03:41.999 --> 03:44.438
The biggest summer
since records began.

03:44.439 --> 03:47.078
But we were ready. More than ready.

03:47.079 --> 03:50.118
We knew who we were,
we knew where we were going

03:50.119 --> 03:53.318
and, like Stamford's answer
to Destiny's Child,

03:53.319 --> 03:57.319
we were ready to take over
the world.

03:58.559 --> 04:00.999
I had already found my dream job.

04:00.999 --> 04:04.678
Town Records was off-the-scale
amazing.

04:04.679 --> 04:08.679
Like living in your actual hobby.

04:10.959 --> 04:14.959
My baby sister was growing
cuter by the minute.

04:15.679 --> 04:18.958
Finn's arse was peachier than ever.

04:18.959 --> 04:21.598
I had the gang by my side.
I was happy,

04:21.599 --> 04:25.599
I was healthy, and I hadn't hurt
myself in over a year.

04:31.879 --> 04:33.878
Here we go.

04:33.879 --> 04:35.718
14 Toxic Bombs.

04:35.719 --> 04:38.758
I found the recipe on something
called "The Net".

04:38.759 --> 04:40.238
There we go, one for you.

04:40.239 --> 04:43.678
Chop can have mine - I'm not
drinking until the Leavers' Ball.

04:43.679 --> 04:45.838
Rae?

04:45.839 --> 04:47.838
Well, why can't I have mine?

04:47.839 --> 04:50.518
You're supposed to
be my revision partner.

04:50.519 --> 04:54.519
Cheers. Stop. Wait, wait. Oi!

04:54.639 --> 04:56.598
There's some announcements
to be made first.

04:56.599 --> 05:00.158
To mark the fact this is our last
summer in Stamford,

05:00.159 --> 05:01.798
I'm going to be getting a tattoo.

05:01.799 --> 05:03.878
You've got to be tattoo mad,
how many do you need?

05:03.879 --> 05:05.038
No, I've got one of Izzy

05:05.039 --> 05:07.798
and I'm getting one up
here, too - the gang.

05:07.799 --> 05:11.758
So that every time I look at it,
I think of you lot.

05:11.759 --> 05:13.758
So sweet.

05:13.759 --> 05:15.198
No, wait, wait, wait.

05:15.199 --> 05:17.158
You said announcements. Plural.

05:17.159 --> 05:19.559
Oh, yeah. Finn's got
news and all. Go on.

05:19.560 --> 05:21.039
Don't, don't. Go on.

05:21.039 --> 05:23.838
I've not even told Rae yet,
knobhead.

05:23.839 --> 05:26.518
Well, told me what?

05:26.519 --> 05:30.519
I've been doing a few extra jobs,
and I've put down a deposit

05:32.879 --> 05:35.438
on flat to rent above the bookies.

05:35.439 --> 05:39.439
Good boy, Finn!
I move in Friday, don't I?

05:39.999 --> 05:42.718
Hang on. This Friday? Yeah.

05:42.719 --> 05:46.719
Oh, no. You know what's happening
this Friday, don't you?

05:46.839 --> 05:50.839
The biggest flat-warming party
in the 20th century.

05:51.079 --> 05:52.639
That's what's happening!

05:53.799 --> 05:56.518
I've got exams, I'm not going.

05:56.519 --> 06:00.519
I'm not.

06:01.319 --> 06:05.319
I move in Friday,
but I've got the keys already.

06:05.559 --> 06:08.998
Come round if you don't believe me.

06:08.999 --> 06:12.078
And that, Dear Diary,
is the point I'm making.

06:12.079 --> 06:15.238
Why didn't fucking up your
university interview matter?

06:15.239 --> 06:18.278
Because, there was only one
place on the entire planet

06:18.279 --> 06:22.279
I ever wanted to be.

06:25.519 --> 06:27.958
Right, come on, Mr University.

06:27.959 --> 06:30.998
How you feeling about Durham?

06:30.999 --> 06:33.958
Honestly, Rae, I'm bricking it.

06:33.959 --> 06:36.438
Why?

06:36.439 --> 06:38.318
It's not leaving here or anything,

06:38.319 --> 06:42.319
it's just, I don't want to be the
only gay guy on campus who hasn't

06:44.799 --> 06:46.478
actually....

06:46.479 --> 06:48.118
actually...

06:48.119 --> 06:52.119
Right. Yeah? Yeah, then I pledge to
spending my time helping you find

06:53.799 --> 06:57.799
the hottest man in Stamford. I don't
like it, Archie, but I'll do it.

06:59.359 --> 07:01.718
Well that's awfully
big of you, Rae. I know.

07:01.719 --> 07:03.798
Thank you, though. Give us a kiss.

07:03.799 --> 07:07.799
Hey and who knows? Sex could be
around the very next corner.

07:10.159 --> 07:14.159
I'm OK with that.

07:16.359 --> 07:20.359
And in answer to the question
I know you've been asking...

07:20.399 --> 07:24.399
Yes, we had been,
on a massively regular basis.

07:26.839 --> 07:30.839
Do you know what the best
thing about having my own flat is?

07:37.759 --> 07:40.239
There was something
about being with him.

07:40.239 --> 07:44.239
Our bodies just went together
like sexually explicit Lego.

07:46.239 --> 07:48.118
I love you.

07:48.119 --> 07:49.238
What?

07:49.239 --> 07:51.598
I love you.

07:51.599 --> 07:55.358
What did you just say?

07:55.359 --> 07:57.438
I said,

07:57.439 --> 07:59.478
I...

07:59.479 --> 08:01.238
..love

08:01.239 --> 08:05.038
you.

08:05.039 --> 08:09.039
Oh, my God, he had actually said it!

08:09.279 --> 08:13.279
The words were like music, they
spread and tingled through my veins.

08:14.959 --> 08:18.359
Life was so perfect, I could burst!

08:28.279 --> 08:29.919
What time do you call this?

08:29.919 --> 08:33.158
You are supposed to be
studying, young lady.

08:33.159 --> 08:37.159
Oh, you got a letter,
it's behind the pig.

08:44.039 --> 08:45.798
It's Blockbusters, isn't it?

08:45.799 --> 08:47.398
Wanting Benny and Joon back.

08:47.399 --> 08:49.518
They're going to take you
to court in the end, Rae -

08:49.519 --> 08:51.358
it's been over a year.

08:51.359 --> 08:55.359
Fine, I'll sort it.

09:17.799 --> 09:19.402
Oh, tits.

09:38.115 --> 09:40.554
'I'm not going.'

09:40.555 --> 09:42.315
I'm not.

09:42.373 --> 09:45.052
Threw the letter away.

09:45.053 --> 09:49.053
I love Stamford.
And I love my mates.

09:51.253 --> 09:53.853
And my boyfriend loves me.

09:53.853 --> 09:56.572
He said so.

09:56.573 --> 10:00.573
Rae, we've worked so hard. And now
there's this incredible opportunity.

10:02.813 --> 10:05.572
And you have to take it.

10:05.573 --> 10:09.452
I can't see how you can't see that.

10:09.453 --> 10:11.172
Whenever I come to you
with a problem,

10:11.173 --> 10:14.252
you always do the same
classic Kester thing -

10:14.253 --> 10:17.372
you throw it straight back.
"I don't know, Rae. You tell me.

10:17.373 --> 10:19.572
"What do you think you should do?"

10:19.573 --> 10:23.412
And I know why. I get it.

10:23.413 --> 10:27.413
You're trying to help me
work things out for myself.

10:27.573 --> 10:31.573
So why is it this time
you're trying to tell me what to do?

10:32.373 --> 10:35.292
Because...

10:35.293 --> 10:38.052
..you don't know what's out there.
Not yet.

10:38.053 --> 10:39.852
You barely know
what's over the next hill.

10:39.853 --> 10:43.853
I don't need to travel to get
to amazing places.

10:44.813 --> 10:46.652
Well, at least think about it.

10:46.653 --> 10:48.612
I have. And I'm not going.

10:48.613 --> 10:52.613
End of.

10:55.653 --> 10:59.653
What's going on with your room?

11:00.453 --> 11:04.453
They're refurbishing. Why?

11:04.493 --> 11:06.412
Your guess is as good as mine.
Oh, there he is.

11:06.413 --> 11:10.413
The old Kester - "I don't know, Rae.
You tell me."

11:11.693 --> 11:15.092
'It didn't matter what Kester said.
That letter was in the bin.

11:15.093 --> 11:17.332
'I wasn't going to freak out
about my future.

11:17.333 --> 11:19.532
'Chloe was doing enough
of that for everyone.

11:19.533 --> 11:22.652
'She was obsessed with getting into
Lincolnshire School of Business,

11:22.653 --> 11:24.292
'hence the power dressing.'

11:24.293 --> 11:26.092
Don't take this the wrong way,
Chloe,

11:26.093 --> 11:29.773
but you do know it's 1998,
don't you, and not 1985?

11:33.653 --> 11:35.892
I think she meant the Filofax.

11:35.893 --> 11:39.612
Er, Filofaxes, Rae,
are a revision tool.

11:39.613 --> 11:42.932
You would know if you took
revision more seriously.

11:42.933 --> 11:45.532
All right listen up, everyone.
I have to say,

11:45.533 --> 11:48.452
when I looked at the date this
morning, my heart jumped slightly.

11:48.453 --> 11:49.972
I'm sure I wasn't the only one.

11:49.973 --> 11:52.812
That's right, less than one week
to go before A levels.

11:52.813 --> 11:55.692
But there will be a careers fair
tomorrow afternoon.

11:55.693 --> 11:59.693
Erm, Miss, is there going to be people
there from the business community?

12:00.333 --> 12:03.572
Or is it just going to be like people
from, like, you know, round here?

12:03.573 --> 12:05.492
My dad's coming.

12:05.493 --> 12:09.493
Your dad owns the cattery.
Yeah. It's a business.

12:09.573 --> 12:13.573
Lois is right. There will be several
local businesses represented.

12:13.653 --> 12:16.012
If you don't get the grades
you're hoping for,

12:16.013 --> 12:18.132
or if you didn't get the offer
you're expecting,

12:18.133 --> 12:21.092
there'll be people waiting
to talk to you in the hall...

12:21.093 --> 12:25.012
Have Bristol rejected you now,
then, Rae?

12:25.013 --> 12:26.252
Yeah.

12:26.253 --> 12:28.572
What? Officially?

12:28.573 --> 12:32.573
Yeah.

12:39.253 --> 12:43.092
You OK to turn that down a sec? Yeah.

12:43.093 --> 12:47.093
Hello?

12:48.053 --> 12:51.892
Tell... Tell me you're joking.

12:51.893 --> 12:55.412
You're not joking.

12:55.413 --> 12:59.413
Well, then, I'm really sorry.

12:59.653 --> 13:03.653
I'm genuinely sorry.

13:06.973 --> 13:10.973
You, erm, you OK, Rob?

13:12.333 --> 13:14.772
That was my date.

13:14.773 --> 13:17.852
What I thought was my date.

13:17.853 --> 13:20.252
Long story, man.

13:20.253 --> 13:23.572
She let you down?

13:23.573 --> 13:27.573
He.

13:31.293 --> 13:35.293
And not for the first time.

13:44.853 --> 13:48.853
Archie, I've got one.

13:51.453 --> 13:53.972
Oh, sorry about my language.

13:53.973 --> 13:57.172
What language? What the fuck
are you doing in my room?

13:57.173 --> 13:59.892
Can you keep your voice down when
you're swearing at me, please?

13:59.893 --> 14:03.012
The baby's sleeping.
Why are you in my room?

14:03.013 --> 14:06.572
Right, I came in here on behalf
of Blockbusters Video,

14:06.573 --> 14:10.372
looking to put an end to that Benny
& Joon saga once and for all.

14:10.373 --> 14:13.492
But I ended up finding something
a little bit better than

14:13.493 --> 14:16.652
Johnny Depp, didn't I?

14:16.653 --> 14:20.653
You told me it went badly. Rae!

14:21.093 --> 14:25.093
Do you know how many member of our
family have been to university?

14:25.773 --> 14:27.092
None!

14:27.093 --> 14:31.093
I am so proud of you, young lady.

14:32.213 --> 14:36.213
I am so proud of my little chicken.

14:36.493 --> 14:40.493
She's finally hatched, and she's
turned into a beautiful swan.

14:43.813 --> 14:46.332
With English Paper One
in just ten days' time,

14:46.333 --> 14:49.252
I could spot a mixed metaphor
a mile away.

14:49.253 --> 14:53.253
Come and sit down
next to your old mum.

15:00.893 --> 15:03.852
Come in, love.

15:03.853 --> 15:05.492
I tell you important story.

15:05.493 --> 15:09.493
When my father was a young man, he
moved from the desert to the city

15:10.733 --> 15:12.532
to make better life.

15:12.533 --> 15:16.332
But before he leave,
his father came to him.

15:16.333 --> 15:19.772
And he give my father a chain...

15:19.773 --> 15:23.773
..to guard him his journey. And...

15:24.253 --> 15:28.253
..to say he was very proud.

15:31.493 --> 15:33.612
Er...

15:33.613 --> 15:36.492
It would be, for me,

15:36.493 --> 15:40.052
an honour to give this to you

15:40.053 --> 15:44.053
to guard you your journey, Bristol,
and...

15:44.933 --> 15:48.933
..because I'm very proud of you.

15:51.453 --> 15:55.453
That's so beautiful.

15:58.573 --> 16:02.573
We're on our way!

16:04.413 --> 16:07.732
'How do you break it to the people
who believe in you the most

16:07.733 --> 16:11.733
'that you don't want to follow the
path they think is best for you?

16:12.493 --> 16:15.292
'I needed to tell Finn.

16:15.293 --> 16:17.172
'I wasn't going.

16:17.173 --> 16:21.173
'Just because Bristol was a good
opportunity didn't mean I had to go.'

16:22.693 --> 16:25.413
Hey, don't you be looking!
I'm not!

16:26.613 --> 16:28.092
Boom! What do you think?

16:28.093 --> 16:31.572
Well, it's a little bit
like it was yesterday.

16:31.573 --> 16:33.092
'As in, identical.'

16:33.093 --> 16:36.412
No. There's a beanbag
and there's two new posters.

16:36.413 --> 16:40.413
And the fridge works.

16:40.853 --> 16:43.172
I'm happy for you.

16:43.173 --> 16:47.173
Are you really? Yeah.

16:48.413 --> 16:51.572
Because there's something
that I wanted to ask you,

16:51.573 --> 16:55.573
and I-I didn't want to suggest it
in case, you know, I was...

16:57.493 --> 17:00.052
..holding you back.

17:00.053 --> 17:04.053
But, seeing as you didn't
get into Bristol...

17:05.213 --> 17:07.132
..if you...

17:07.133 --> 17:11.133
if you wanted to move in here...

17:20.573 --> 17:21.972
What?!

17:21.973 --> 17:24.292
Move in here with me.

17:26.653 --> 17:30.653
I mean, we could have a joint
flat-warming party on Friday,

17:31.053 --> 17:32.092
if you want.

17:32.093 --> 17:36.093
Only if you want.
It won't be a big deal.

17:40.813 --> 17:42.972
I love you.

17:42.973 --> 17:45.292
'But how could I tell him now?

17:45.293 --> 17:49.293
'How could I let anything
get in the way of this?'

17:52.093 --> 17:56.093
Cheers! Cheers!

17:56.533 --> 17:58.172
'The sexiest man since sliced ham

17:58.173 --> 18:02.173
'wanted me to move in with him for
decent music, proper cuddles

18:02.693 --> 18:05.692
'and Olympic-standard
gymnastic knobbing.

18:05.693 --> 18:07.612
'I just had to pack the first bag,

18:07.613 --> 18:11.012
'sneak past Mum so she didn't blow
her top about Bristol,

18:11.013 --> 18:15.013
'then get my arse round to Finn
and Rae's new shag-shack.'

18:17.293 --> 18:19.692
Oh, what's in your bag?

18:19.693 --> 18:22.932
Books. I'm going to revise.

18:22.933 --> 18:25.372
'Revise my knowledge
of Finn Nelson's genitalia.'

18:25.373 --> 18:28.213
Good girl.

18:31.893 --> 18:34.812
Not flowers, Archie.
Not the first time you meet him.

18:34.813 --> 18:38.813
They're for you. Chloe told me
you didn't get into Bristol.

18:39.173 --> 18:43.173
Here comes the lecture
from Mr University.

18:43.853 --> 18:45.212
There's always Clearing, Rae,

18:45.213 --> 18:47.052
and Peterborough Uni's
always got places.

18:47.053 --> 18:50.412
Do you know what, it doesn't
matter about not getting in.

18:50.413 --> 18:52.332
Finn's asked me to move in with him,

18:52.333 --> 18:56.333
so I'm going to be doing a degree
in the art of fellatio.

18:58.133 --> 19:00.532
Come on!

19:00.533 --> 19:03.212
Looking a bit nervous there, Arch!

19:03.213 --> 19:07.213
Well, what if I'm not his type?

19:08.933 --> 19:10.612
Oh, my God.

19:10.613 --> 19:14.252
It's like being gay in 3D.

19:14.253 --> 19:15.452
Well...

19:15.453 --> 19:19.453
You know what they say, don't you?
"Nerves are a good thing."

19:20.213 --> 19:21.812
Why do they say that?

19:21.813 --> 19:22.972
Don't know!

19:22.973 --> 19:26.412
It's just something that you say
to nervous people, isn't it?

19:26.413 --> 19:28.772
OK.

19:28.773 --> 19:32.773
I'm going in.

19:37.933 --> 19:39.533
Hiya.

19:41.133 --> 19:43.172
Who was that guy?

19:43.173 --> 19:44.932
Which guy?

19:44.933 --> 19:47.572
The geeky-looking guy
I saw you with in that car just now.

19:47.573 --> 19:51.573
I don't know.

20:12.213 --> 20:13.972
You OK, mate?

20:13.973 --> 20:17.973
Yeah, mate, just, erm,
just looking, just looking.

20:37.733 --> 20:39.013
Was he checking me out?

20:42.533 --> 20:45.652
Yeah.

20:45.653 --> 20:47.612
He's cute.

20:47.613 --> 20:50.292
Looks better without the bins.

20:50.293 --> 20:54.293
Get him to give me a call.

20:55.573 --> 20:56.972
'And there it was.

20:56.973 --> 20:59.572
'Against all odds,
in a town that wasn't even supposed

20:59.573 --> 21:03.573
'to have a dartboard, Archie had hit
a massive gay bull's-eye.'

21:04.693 --> 21:05.893
Hello! Hello.

21:08.013 --> 21:12.013
You can't just do that, you
can't just pick what you want.

21:12.093 --> 21:16.093
Listen to this.

21:16.333 --> 21:19.093
OK.

21:28.155 --> 21:30.170
Moving in with someone's
a big step, Rae.

21:30.395 --> 21:32.434
It's exciting.

21:32.435 --> 21:35.314
And Finn, he thinks that you turning
down the offer from Bristol,

21:35.315 --> 21:37.354
he thinks that's a good idea,
does he?

21:37.355 --> 21:41.034
It's what we both want. Because...

21:41.035 --> 21:43.114
..well, because,
from what I understand,

21:43.115 --> 21:46.034
from what you've told me about him,
your boyfriend wouldn't want

21:46.035 --> 21:47.995
anything but the best for you,

21:47.996 --> 21:51.995
and he's selfless, you know,
in that respect.

21:52.075 --> 21:55.394
That's right, isn't it? Yeah, he is.

21:55.395 --> 21:58.675
What, so, he just thinks that
Bristol's too far away? No.

21:58.675 --> 22:00.995
What, it's not a good enough
university? No.

22:00.996 --> 22:03.554
Please, help me out here,
because I'm struggling here.

22:03.555 --> 22:06.314
There must be some reason why
he's, erm...

22:06.315 --> 22:10.315
well, as I see it,
clipping your wings.

22:10.715 --> 22:13.394
He loves me. Exactly.

22:13.395 --> 22:17.395
And I love him, and we live here,
and that's the end of it.

22:19.635 --> 22:22.554
Just checking.

22:22.555 --> 22:25.194
You know something, Rae?
We've been talking like this,

22:25.195 --> 22:28.834
me and you, for two years now.

22:28.835 --> 22:31.674
Now, a lot as changed in that time.

22:31.675 --> 22:34.274
In this room and out there.

22:34.275 --> 22:37.874
You have become someone
extra special.

22:37.875 --> 22:40.954
Are you splitting up with me?

22:40.955 --> 22:43.314
We've reached the stage now,
Rae, where we need to

22:43.315 --> 22:47.154
be looking to wind things down.

22:47.155 --> 22:51.155
To complete the process.

22:51.315 --> 22:54.594
That's it. That's why you
want me to go to university.

22:54.595 --> 22:57.194
No. Because you want to end therapy,
so that's your excuse.

22:57.195 --> 22:59.514
No, it's the opposite. I want
you to go to university

22:59.515 --> 23:03.515
because you are ready
to end therapy.

23:04.475 --> 23:06.994
You know your own mind, Rae.

23:06.995 --> 23:10.234
You've said as much yourself.

23:10.235 --> 23:14.235
How you're in love,
how you're secure.

23:14.675 --> 23:18.634
It's a shock to any patient,
the idea of ending sessions.

23:18.635 --> 23:21.074
Of course it is.

23:21.075 --> 23:23.914
But I say this with confidence...

23:23.915 --> 23:27.915
You have no idea
how proud I am of you.

23:27.955 --> 23:31.034
Of how far you've come.

23:31.035 --> 23:32.875
Why are you doing it so suddenly?

23:32.875 --> 23:34.874
I'm not.

23:34.875 --> 23:37.314
There's no rush.

23:37.315 --> 23:41.315
It's not like flicking a switch.
We can take it gently.

23:42.315 --> 23:46.315
I'm not going anywhere.

23:48.915 --> 23:52.915
Nearly finished.

23:53.635 --> 23:57.635
Look, actually, we're right in the
middle of something here. Thank you.

24:00.675 --> 24:04.114
So, erm, what about
the last week in June?

24:04.115 --> 24:08.115
That gives us three more sessions.

24:09.955 --> 24:13.794
Ever since I first left hospital,
Kester had kept me together.

24:13.795 --> 24:16.554
But now it felt like the foundations
of life in Stamford

24:16.555 --> 24:19.354
were starting to crack.

24:19.355 --> 24:21.794
At least I still had
the gang to talk to.

24:21.795 --> 24:25.795
They could catch me if I fell.

24:26.595 --> 24:29.674
Rae! What the fuck?!

24:29.675 --> 24:32.314
We were supposed to be highlighting
our Emmas like an hour ago.

24:32.315 --> 24:34.874
It's as if A levels mean
nothing to you.

24:34.875 --> 24:38.875
Come on. It's started.

24:47.915 --> 24:49.354
Careers Day.

24:49.355 --> 24:53.355
Like the lights had just come on
in the world's shittest disco.

24:56.635 --> 24:59.474
Do you think I should join the army?
No. Are you sure?

24:59.475 --> 25:03.475
Yeah. Rae!

25:03.675 --> 25:07.675
Is that... Katie Springer?!

25:08.075 --> 25:10.394
Hang on, who's Katie Springer?

25:10.395 --> 25:13.314
She looks amazing. Yeah, If you like
that kind of thing.

25:13.315 --> 25:15.634
Which everyone does.
Anyway, how do you know her?

25:15.635 --> 25:17.794
We met for like a second in Bristol.

25:17.795 --> 25:21.434
Rae, how's it going?
I was so hoping to see you.

25:21.435 --> 25:23.834
It's so weird being back at college.
What you doing here?

25:23.835 --> 25:26.674
Well, the principal's asked me
back to talk about going to uni,

25:26.675 --> 25:29.794
and Dan Smith to
talk about not going.

25:29.795 --> 25:33.795
Ku Klux Dan? Mmm-hmm,
he works in the garden centre now.

25:37.035 --> 25:40.954
Hiya, Izzy! Hi, Katie.
You all right?

25:40.955 --> 25:43.394
And you remember Chloe?

25:43.395 --> 25:47.395
Erm, it's nice to meet you.
Hey, I like your costume.

25:48.555 --> 25:51.114
Can I have your attention
everyone, please?

25:51.115 --> 25:53.754
Two of last year's leavers have
kindly agreed to come back

25:53.755 --> 25:56.914
and tell you all a little bit
about what life's like out there,

25:56.915 --> 26:00.315
so please welcome
Katie Springer and Daniel Smith.

26:05.275 --> 26:07.354
How could she not remember me?

26:07.355 --> 26:11.355
I used to blank her,
like, the whole time.

26:11.515 --> 26:14.674
Hiya. Erm, I'm Katie.

26:14.675 --> 26:18.675
Er, when I was here, at Stamford,

26:19.435 --> 26:22.274
I pretty much had zero confidence.

26:22.275 --> 26:25.274
I kept myself to myself
the whole time.

26:25.275 --> 26:29.275
Erm, most of you probably
never even knew who I was.

26:30.875 --> 26:34.875
So even though I had
this amazing, amazing offer

26:35.715 --> 26:39.715
to study at Bristol, I kept making
out that uni wasn't for me.

26:40.115 --> 26:42.034
Stamford was big enough.

26:42.035 --> 26:46.035
So what I want to say to
those of you who have an offer,

26:46.275 --> 26:49.794
or are just daunted
by what's out there,

26:49.795 --> 26:52.994
beyond those gates...

26:52.995 --> 26:56.394
..is be strong...

26:56.395 --> 26:58.714
..and go for it.

26:58.715 --> 27:01.674
I would like to leave you
with a quote by someone first

27:01.675 --> 27:04.514
introduced to me
by Principal Dixon...

27:04.515 --> 27:07.074
George Eliot.

27:07.075 --> 27:11.075
"It's never too late to be
what you might have been."

27:13.075 --> 27:17.075
Cheers!

27:19.275 --> 27:23.074
What year's George Eliot in?

27:23.075 --> 27:25.394
Maybe I'd been stupid to rule out
Bristol.

27:25.395 --> 27:28.394
But, no - it was fine.
Completely fine.

27:28.395 --> 27:31.834
Just because Katie Springer was like
a walking advert for university

27:31.835 --> 27:35.394
didn't mean there weren't people who
could do the same for Stamford.

27:35.395 --> 27:38.434
A lot of people think there's only
one kind of Koi carp you can

27:38.435 --> 27:42.434
buy at the garden centre
on Barnack Road.

27:42.435 --> 27:45.874
There aren't. There are six.

27:45.875 --> 27:49.434
Oh, bollocks.

27:49.435 --> 27:51.954
Thank you. Oh, this was getting
ridiculous,

27:51.955 --> 27:55.474
I had to talk to someone who would
understand about the offer.

27:55.475 --> 27:58.394
I wasn't thinking about it, because
I didn't think I had anything

27:58.395 --> 28:01.154
to think about, but I haven't even
told him. Told who?

28:01.155 --> 28:03.394
My boyfriend. Who's you boyfriend?
Finn.

28:03.395 --> 28:06.514
Finn Nelson? Yeah, I know.

28:06.515 --> 28:09.794
But If I stay here, then he's going
to think that I gave up my dream

28:09.795 --> 28:13.434
for him, but it's not like that!
What dream, Rae? Bristol.

28:13.435 --> 28:15.474
So Bristol is your dream?
No, I didn't say that.

28:15.475 --> 28:17.514
Well, you literally just said that
to me, Rae.

28:17.515 --> 28:19.194
No, well, I didn't think it was,

28:19.195 --> 28:21.794
but now I've lied to everyone
and it's all a big mess. OK.

28:21.795 --> 28:23.594
I just don't know what to do.

28:23.595 --> 28:26.154
Look, I get your dilemma, I do.

28:26.155 --> 28:28.434
Don't tell anyone about this!
No, I won't.

28:28.435 --> 28:30.274
Look, I don't go
back for another week,

28:30.275 --> 28:33.954
so if you want to talk to me
about this, then you can, OK?

28:33.955 --> 28:36.594
All right. Thanks. OK.

28:36.595 --> 28:40.394
An offer to read English at Bristol
is fantastic, Rae.

28:40.395 --> 28:42.754
The Head of Department phoned
to say how impressed

28:42.755 --> 28:44.194
he was by your passion.

28:44.195 --> 28:46.354
Said he didn't get the chance to
tell you in person.

28:46.355 --> 28:47.834
Who else have you told?

28:47.835 --> 28:51.835
Well, everyone. It's such
an inspiring story, Rae.

28:52.755 --> 28:56.755
See you. Rae!

29:02.275 --> 29:04.154
I knew I should've told Finn,

29:04.155 --> 29:07.354
but I hadn't thought there was a
decision to make.

29:07.355 --> 29:11.355
I couldn't let him
find out from anyone else.

29:21.595 --> 29:25.354
How the fuck was I going
to explain this?

29:25.355 --> 29:28.274
Nice one, Raemundo!

29:28.275 --> 29:30.714
Oh, that's it, is it?
Yeah, Rae's got her offer,

29:30.715 --> 29:32.314
Chloe can sort herself out. No.

29:32.315 --> 29:34.554
"Well, there is no point
revising with her,

29:34.555 --> 29:36.834
"she's not getting tip-top grades,
is she?"

29:36.835 --> 29:38.194
Is that why you lied to me?

29:38.195 --> 29:40.954
Izzy, have you seen Finn?
I'm trying to talk to you.

29:40.955 --> 29:44.034
He's looking for you. Do you know
where he went? Rae, don't ignore me.

29:44.035 --> 29:45.954
I'm just trying to find out
where Finn is.

29:45.955 --> 29:49.074
Well, I don't get why you lied to me.
We're supposed to tell each other

29:49.075 --> 29:51.434
everything. Rae, I would have just
revised on my own!

29:51.435 --> 29:53.034
You're not even revising, Chloe.

29:53.035 --> 29:55.834
All you're doing is just
highlighting stuff. Do you mind?

29:55.835 --> 29:58.434
Sometimes whole pages,
which is exactly the same

29:58.435 --> 30:02.435
as highlighting none of it!

30:04.995 --> 30:06.634
Danny, have you seen Finn?

30:06.635 --> 30:09.354
No. Listen - those two - they've had
four shots each

30:09.355 --> 30:12.074
and they haven't said two words.

30:12.075 --> 30:16.075
Right.

30:23.875 --> 30:27.874
What's going on? We're raising a
glass of non-alcoholic champagne.

30:27.875 --> 30:30.194
To you!

30:30.195 --> 30:32.154
Hey, Finn! Do you like Rae's chain?

30:32.155 --> 30:36.155
Karim got her that to keep her safe
on her journey to Bristol.

30:36.995 --> 30:40.995
Yeah. Nice one.

30:45.475 --> 30:47.674
Don't.

30:47.675 --> 30:51.675
Here's to you. Genuinely, Rae.

30:58.035 --> 31:00.154
You know what?

31:00.155 --> 31:03.354
Before I asked you to
move in with me...

31:03.355 --> 31:07.355
..I checked there was no chance you
were going to uni.

31:08.315 --> 31:11.314
I double checked, Rae.

31:11.315 --> 31:13.834
For me.

31:13.835 --> 31:16.394
Because the last thing
I wanted to do in my life

31:16.395 --> 31:19.234
is to hold you back, do you know
that? You're not holding me back.

31:19.235 --> 31:22.514
I went to the pub earlier, and you
were all anyone was talking about.

31:22.515 --> 31:24.114
"Rae Earl's off to uni!

31:24.115 --> 31:27.515
"Aw, you must be so proud, mate."
Do you know what that's like?

31:27.515 --> 31:30.554
Why would you lie to me? I didn't.

31:30.555 --> 31:34.314
I didn't mean to.

31:34.315 --> 31:38.315
Were you lying about
the interview going badly? No.

31:38.395 --> 31:42.395
No, were you lying when you said you
wanted to move in with me, no? No.

31:45.795 --> 31:49.795
So, were you lying
when you told me that you loved me?

31:51.875 --> 31:55.554
No!

31:55.555 --> 31:59.394
Oh, please, Finn...

31:59.395 --> 32:01.674
Being with you

32:01.675 --> 32:05.675
is more than I ever dreamed of.

32:06.075 --> 32:10.075
It's a joke and we both know it.

32:10.315 --> 32:14.315
People must think I've won
a competition.

32:15.395 --> 32:16.954
Rae...

32:16.955 --> 32:20.834
Your mum showed me the letter.

32:20.835 --> 32:24.314
Look, if you can't decide what you
really want -

32:24.315 --> 32:28.114
if you can't decide
between us and uni -

32:28.115 --> 32:32.115
then I think... we should go on a
break until you do.

32:33.595 --> 32:37.394
Because...

32:37.395 --> 32:40.034
..cos I'm sorry, Rae,

32:40.035 --> 32:44.035
but this isn't... it's not fair,
is it?

32:50.355 --> 32:54.355
Finn! What?
Well, what about the party?

32:56.435 --> 32:58.594
Party?

32:58.595 --> 33:02.595
I'm not really in the mood.

34:07.875 --> 34:11.141
Will you see to her, Rae? Yeah.

34:17.279 --> 34:19.679
So, there's always
the long-distance relationship,

34:19.726 --> 34:22.844
but you have to put the hours in,
you know, motorway-wise.

34:22.846 --> 34:25.065
Danny, I dunno.

34:25.081 --> 34:29.081
Well, the other option
is the open relationship.

34:29.562 --> 34:32.521
You know? He can do his thing,
you can do yours.

34:32.522 --> 34:36.522
Yeah, right.

34:37.042 --> 34:41.042
Danny... do you like
living in Stamford?

34:41.842 --> 34:44.442
Is it enough for you?

34:44.442 --> 34:47.561
I love it, Rae.
It's like I've scored a goal.

34:47.562 --> 34:51.562
'It was perfect for Danny,
but was Stamford enough for me?'

34:51.842 --> 34:53.922
Oh, here you go.

34:53.922 --> 34:56.282
'It wouldn't be the same
without the gang,

34:56.283 --> 35:00.282
'and if the others moved on,
what would I do?

35:00.922 --> 35:03.361
'But while my own future
was uncertain,

35:03.362 --> 35:06.041
'Archie was on to a sure thing.

35:06.042 --> 35:10.042
'Rob had invited him over,
and dinner was NOT on the menu.'

35:10.762 --> 35:13.841
I've... I've... I've, erm,
I've shaved, Rae.

35:13.842 --> 35:16.401
Do you think that was wise?
Yeah, you look nice.

35:16.402 --> 35:18.841
No. I've, erm...

35:18.842 --> 35:22.842
I've shaved.

35:24.442 --> 35:27.361
Oh, er, yeah, yeah!
I'm sure he'll appreciate it.

35:27.362 --> 35:29.161
Yeah? Yeah.

35:29.162 --> 35:30.401
Good luck, Arch!

35:30.402 --> 35:33.801
Oh, cheers, Danny.
Thanks for making me do this..

35:33.802 --> 35:37.802
Hey, listen, Archie...
You don't have to do anything.

35:38.082 --> 35:39.681
Yeah, yeah, I do.

35:39.682 --> 35:41.601
No, because what if you get in there

35:41.602 --> 35:44.841
and then you decide
that it's not for you?

35:44.842 --> 35:48.842
Well, it still would have been
worth going in.

35:49.242 --> 35:53.242
All right.

35:58.162 --> 35:59.961
There he goes.

35:59.962 --> 36:03.801
Archibald and his bald balls!

36:03.802 --> 36:07.241
'I couldn't believe
how brave Archie was.

36:07.242 --> 36:11.242
'He wasn't afraid to step into
the unknown.'

36:13.042 --> 36:15.561
I'm still not sure about that shirt.

36:15.562 --> 36:18.161
I wouldn't worry about the shirt,
Rae.

36:18.162 --> 36:22.162
That'll be torn off his body
the moment he steps inside.

36:24.282 --> 36:27.121
'We'd been waiting
outside Rob's for ages

36:27.122 --> 36:30.161
'and I was starting to get worried.'

36:30.162 --> 36:33.081
They'll be in an advanced
state of foreplay by now.

36:33.082 --> 36:35.521
Hands, tongues, fingers,
you name it...

36:35.522 --> 36:37.121
It'll be every man for himself.

36:37.122 --> 36:40.521
Penetration, Rae...

36:40.522 --> 36:42.401
will be imminent.

36:42.402 --> 36:46.001
Danny!

36:46.002 --> 36:49.681
'What if Archie was wrong
and it WASN'T worth going in?

36:49.682 --> 36:52.041
'What if something terrible
happens to you

36:52.042 --> 36:55.241
'when you step into the unknown?'

36:55.242 --> 36:57.841
'What if Rob was actually
a serial killer?

36:57.842 --> 37:00.881
'What if he buried his victims
under the patio,

37:00.882 --> 37:03.041
'like in Brookside?'

37:03.042 --> 37:07.042
They've been in there
a really long time, Danny.

37:08.482 --> 37:10.202
I'm going in.

37:10.202 --> 37:12.442
Are you sure? Yeah.

37:39.042 --> 37:42.922
'Suddenly, I could see everything.

37:42.922 --> 37:46.922
'Archie knew what he wanted
and he was going for it.

37:47.322 --> 37:51.322
'Archie had taken control,
and I had to do the same.

38:01.562 --> 38:05.161
'Ever since that letter arrived,
everything had fallen apart.

38:05.162 --> 38:08.001
'I had to fix it.

38:08.002 --> 38:12.002
'I needed to put things back to
the way they were before the offer.

38:12.442 --> 38:16.442
'And that meant getting
the gang together.'

38:23.602 --> 38:26.041
Hiya.

38:26.042 --> 38:30.042
She's supposed to be revising,
Rae.

38:30.482 --> 38:33.322
Go on. Thanks.

38:34.842 --> 38:38.842
Hello.

38:44.282 --> 38:48.041
He shouldn't have let you in.

38:48.042 --> 38:52.042
Do you know, it wasn't what you said,
it was the way that you said it.

38:54.042 --> 38:55.521
Sorry.

38:55.522 --> 38:59.161
Oh...

38:59.162 --> 39:03.162
Just read it. What is it?
Just read it.

39:08.802 --> 39:11.521
That's fucking amazing!

39:11.522 --> 39:14.201
Well, I still need a B and two Cs.
I've got no chance.

39:14.202 --> 39:16.001
Yeah, you do. No, I don't.

39:16.002 --> 39:18.441
You and Archie could do it.
I'm out of my depth.

39:18.442 --> 39:21.921
And this stupid song! It's supposed
to be "study friendly".

39:21.922 --> 39:24.201
It's Enya, for fuck's sake.

39:24.202 --> 39:25.601
Enya!

39:25.602 --> 39:29.602
OK, Chloe, I haven't...

39:30.642 --> 39:34.281
I haven't been a very good
revision partner, have I? No.

39:34.282 --> 39:38.282
No. But the thing is...
I've made my decision.

39:39.522 --> 39:42.281
Er, what decision?

39:42.282 --> 39:45.601
I'm staying in Stamford!

39:45.602 --> 39:46.721
Oh!

39:46.722 --> 39:47.761
So...

39:47.762 --> 39:51.762
We are going to have a
flat-warming party. It is back on.

39:52.162 --> 39:54.241
Whoa! Hang on a minute. Where?

39:54.242 --> 39:55.841
Tonight.

39:55.842 --> 39:57.561
Tonight?! Yeah.

39:57.562 --> 40:00.881
Rae, that's all too quick. We've got
Sociology on Monday morning.

40:00.882 --> 40:03.201
That is why you're going to drive.

40:03.202 --> 40:04.801
You're going to drive us back

40:04.802 --> 40:08.761
and then at some point
we'll do some more revision.

40:08.762 --> 40:10.441
Are you OK?

40:10.442 --> 40:13.441
Me? Yeah, I'm fine. I don't think
you're thinking straight.

40:13.442 --> 40:17.442
I am, Chlo, I just...
need you to come with me.

40:18.922 --> 40:20.481
Please.

40:20.482 --> 40:21.841
Please?

40:21.842 --> 40:23.281
Fine!

40:23.282 --> 40:25.201
Yeah? Yep.

40:25.202 --> 40:28.242
Yes! Let's go.

40:31.242 --> 40:33.401
Finn said he was cancelling it.

40:33.402 --> 40:36.041
Yeah, but, erm, he changed his mind.

40:36.042 --> 40:38.001
Guys, should we stop at the offie?

40:38.002 --> 40:41.721
I think I've got enough here.
Let's see.

40:41.722 --> 40:43.641
Two, three... Five... Raemundo.

40:43.642 --> 40:45.801
57... Shit, I lost count.
Raemundo. Hang on.

40:45.802 --> 40:47.201
What?

40:47.202 --> 40:49.721
Chill out.

40:49.722 --> 40:53.401
Here we go. Drambuie Detonators.
Oh, yes, here he is!

40:53.402 --> 40:55.401
Whoa, wait, wait, wait...

40:55.402 --> 40:58.361
An hour in the making,

40:58.362 --> 41:00.681
three days of healing.

41:00.682 --> 41:02.041
Never say...

41:02.042 --> 41:04.802
I'm not a man of me word.

41:11.162 --> 41:13.801
Chop...

41:13.802 --> 41:16.081
Who's Stan Ford?
Yeah.

41:16.082 --> 41:18.761
You idiot It's us.
"Stanford Forever."

41:18.762 --> 41:22.481
It's Stamford.
Stam-ford with an M. You numpty.

41:22.482 --> 41:24.362
You've lived here your whole life!

41:27.242 --> 41:30.401
Like it.

41:30.402 --> 41:33.281
Right, drink up.

41:33.282 --> 41:34.882
Another?

41:39.562 --> 41:43.562
Stanford...

41:43.802 --> 41:47.201
Right, shall we get a wriggle on?

41:47.202 --> 41:50.042
Can we please? You've still got
some more shots to do.

41:50.043 --> 41:51.642
Yeah, yeah, yeah, drink up.

42:13.242 --> 42:16.682
You love birds, get out of the way!

42:18.042 --> 42:21.322
Disgusting. Get off me! Archie,
don't you dare spill that on me!

42:30.482 --> 42:33.801
My name is Rae Earl.
And I love this town!

42:33.802 --> 42:35.921
No-one gets out alive.

42:35.922 --> 42:38.402
In fact... it's a lock-in!

42:40.002 --> 42:41.241
Stan Ford forever!

42:41.242 --> 42:42.722
Stan Ford forever!

43:00.882 --> 43:02.562
What time's the party start?!

43:02.562 --> 43:06.161
Izzy, I've already told you...

43:06.162 --> 43:08.922
The party starts when we get there.

43:10.002 --> 43:12.842
So cheesy!

43:18.242 --> 43:22.242
Rae!

43:23.562 --> 43:25.282
Chloe!

43:38.402 --> 43:41.041
Rae, let me see your hands.
What the fuck, Chloe?!

43:41.042 --> 43:42.882
Let me see your hands! I'm fine!

43:42.883 --> 43:44.881
Why haven't you told me?! I'm fine!

43:44.882 --> 43:48.882
Don't shout at me, Rae.
I'm here for you!

44:46.522 --> 44:48.242
Kester!

44:48.242 --> 44:51.161
Kester! Please!

44:51.162 --> 44:54.801
Kester!

44:54.802 --> 44:58.241
No! Kester!

44:58.242 --> 45:01.922
Kester!

45:34.282 --> 45:36.048
Chloe, can you hear me?
