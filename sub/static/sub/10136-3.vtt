Mr. Tanner, you gotta

15:13.913 --> 15:16.499
read D.J.'s editorial.

15:16.541 --> 15:18.251
It's like pure poetry.

15:20.378 --> 15:23.130
"And so today, when we

15:20.378 --> 15:23.130
vote for class president

15:23.172 --> 15:25.091
"we must put aside

15:23.172 --> 15:25.091
our friendship

15:25.132 --> 15:27.093
"and make

15:25.132 --> 15:27.093
the intelligent choice."

15:27.134 --> 15:29.929
Ha!

15:27.134 --> 15:29.929
So much for President Gibbler.

15:30.971 --> 15:32.849
So much

15:30.971 --> 15:32.849
for our friendship.

15:34.392 --> 15:35.769
D.J.

15:35.810 --> 15:36.853
Kimmy.

15:36.895 --> 15:38.979
We did it!

15:39.021 --> 15:40.523
It was

15:39.021 --> 15:40.523
a Gibbler landslide

15:40.565 --> 15:42.525
and I owe it

15:40.565 --> 15:42.525
all to you.

15:42.567 --> 15:44.611
- You do?

15:42.567 --> 15:44.611
- It was your editorial.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.613
Everyone made

15:44.652 --> 15:46.613
the intelligent choice.

15:46.654 --> 15:50.450
The Party Hearty

15:46.654 --> 15:50.450
Gibblercrats have spoken.

15:50.491 --> 15:52.952
- Hey, congratulations, Kimmy.

15:50.491 --> 15:52.952
- Thanks.

15:52.993 --> 15:54.913
So what about

15:52.993 --> 15:54.913
my campaign promise?

15:54.954 --> 15:57.540
Look on behalf

15:54.954 --> 15:57.540
of the wrestling team

15:57.582 --> 15:59.417
we don't do mud.

15:59.459 --> 16:00.585
Bye.

16:00.627 --> 16:03.003
Well, Steve, wait.

16:00.627 --> 16:03.003
What about hot oil?

16:03.045 --> 16:05.548

16:12.054 --> 16:13.723
Becky-san!

16:13.765 --> 16:15.433
Oh, what a great show!

16:15.475 --> 16:16.893
I don't think Jesse could

16:15.475 --> 16:16.893
be any happier

16:16.935 --> 16:18.978
if he found out

16:16.935 --> 16:18.978
he was related to Elvis.

16:19.019 --> 16:21.105
Well, he's gonna be

16:19.019 --> 16:21.105
treated like a king.

16:21.147 --> 16:24.776
Fat Fish wants him to tour

16:21.147 --> 16:24.776
Asia for the next year.

16:24.818 --> 16:26.360
A whole year?

16:29.155 --> 16:30.573
[chuckles]

16:29.155 --> 16:30.573
Wow!

16:30.615 --> 16:32.116
That's a big decision.

16:32.158 --> 16:34.201
And Jesse's very close

16:32.158 --> 16:34.201
to his family

16:34.243 --> 16:35.954
especially,

16:34.243 --> 16:35.954
his three nieces.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.498
And then, of course,

16:35.995 --> 16:38.498
there's my career so

16:38.539 --> 16:40.834
well we're really gonna have to

16:38.539 --> 16:40.834
sit down and talk about this.

16:40.875 --> 16:44.420
(together)

16:40.875 --> 16:44.420
'Jesse-san. Jesse-san!'

16:44.462 --> 16:46.756
Whoa! Come on, Koji!

16:46.798 --> 16:49.801
Come on, Koji!

16:49.843 --> 16:52.345
Koji,

16:49.843 --> 16:52.345
they love you here.

16:52.386 --> 16:54.013
God, what a rush.

16:54.054 --> 16:56.432
You know, Jess, Nancy just told

16:54.054 --> 16:56.432
me that Fat Fish Records

16:56.474 --> 16:58.935
wants you to tour

16:56.474 --> 16:58.935
the Pacific for the next year.

17:00.394 --> 17:01.771
Really? That's great. Oh!

17:01.813 --> 17:03.940
Well, honey, don't you think

17:01.813 --> 17:03.940
we should--

17:03.982 --> 17:06.901
Celebrate? Exactly.

17:03.982 --> 17:06.901
Koji, break out the good stuff.

17:06.943 --> 17:09.028
- Honey roasted.

17:06.943 --> 17:09.028
- I love this guy.

17:09.069 --> 17:11.113
[knock on door]

17:11.531 --> 17:12.782
Oh!

17:12.824 --> 17:14.241
Jess, the press is here.

17:14.283 --> 17:16.076
We could announce

17:14.283 --> 17:16.076
the big tour.

17:16.118 --> 17:17.328
Jess, we have to talk,<i> now.</i>

17:17.370 --> 17:18.621
Honey, we can't keep

17:17.370 --> 17:18.621
the press waiting.

17:18.663 --> 17:21.123
Let them in.

17:18.663 --> 17:21.123
Hi, press. Hey, everybody.

17:21.165 --> 17:23.209
It's nice to see you.

17:21.165 --> 17:23.209
Hi. I'm Jesse.

17:23.250 --> 17:24.878
- I hope y'all enjoyed the show.

17:23.250 --> 17:24.878
- Excuse me.

17:37.264 --> 17:38.599
Becky, what's gotten into you?

17:38.641 --> 17:41.185
And when did you learn

17:38.641 --> 17:41.185
to yell in Japanese?

17:41.227 --> 17:43.604
I've had a lot

17:41.227 --> 17:43.604
time on my hands.

17:43.646 --> 17:45.023
That was the press you

17:43.646 --> 17:45.023
just kicked out of here.

17:45.105 --> 17:46.733
Jesse, I don't care.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.401
You just agreed to tour

17:46.774 --> 17:48.401
for a whole year

17:48.442 --> 17:50.486
without so much as

17:48.442 --> 17:50.486
asking me what I thought.

17:50.528 --> 17:52.279
Well, we'll have fun.

17:50.528 --> 17:52.279
Just like we've been having.

17:52.321 --> 17:54.448
Oh, yeah, jess.

17:52.321 --> 17:54.448
It's been a blast.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.409
Eating without you,

17:54.490 --> 17:56.409
sightseeing without you

17:56.450 --> 17:58.494
kissing the kids

17:56.450 --> 17:58.494
goodnight without you.

17:58.536 --> 18:02.707
Yesterday, Nicky called

17:58.536 --> 18:02.707
the limo driver daddy-san.

18:02.749 --> 18:05.543
You know, we do have

18:02.749 --> 18:05.543
a similar hair thing going on.

18:05.585 --> 18:08.170
Jess, what has happened

18:05.585 --> 18:08.170
to your priorities?

18:08.212 --> 18:10.590
It's like all of a sudden your

18:08.212 --> 18:10.590
family's way down on the list.

18:10.631 --> 18:12.383
Oh, come on, Becky.

18:10.631 --> 18:12.383
You're over exaggerating.

18:12.425 --> 18:15.011
- My family's number one to me.

18:12.425 --> 18:15.011
- Oh, really?

18:15.053 --> 18:16.804
Well, didn't you tell Michelle

18:15.053 --> 18:16.804
that you'd write to her

18:16.846 --> 18:18.848
every day for the whole

18:16.846 --> 18:18.848
two weeks?

18:18.890 --> 18:20.516
Yeah, so I missed

18:18.890 --> 18:20.516
a few days.

18:20.558 --> 18:22.309
'Try 13.'

18:22.351 --> 18:24.395
And you said that you'd

18:22.351 --> 18:24.395
call home on Wednesday.

18:24.437 --> 18:25.772
I will call home on Wednesday.

18:25.813 --> 18:27.690
It's Friday.

18:27.732 --> 18:30.068
The human calendar.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.485
I'll just have

18:30.109 --> 18:31.485
my people schedule it in

18:31.527 --> 18:33.320
and then I'll

18:31.527 --> 18:33.320
call her tomorrow.

18:33.362 --> 18:34.781
Schedule it in?

18:35.907 --> 18:38.367
Jesse, listen to yourself.

18:38.409 --> 18:39.869
What has happened to you?

18:39.911 --> 18:41.161
Well, in case,

18:39.911 --> 18:41.161
you haven't noticed

18:41.203 --> 18:43.039
my dream is

18:41.203 --> 18:43.039
finally coming true.

18:43.081 --> 18:46.000
I mean, look at this place.

18:43.081 --> 18:46.000
Look how they treat me here.

18:46.042 --> 18:49.128
I have banners and balloons

18:46.042 --> 18:49.128
and fruit baskets.

18:49.169 --> 18:50.713
Look at these

18:49.169 --> 18:50.713
fruit baskets.

18:50.755 --> 18:51.965
Becky, I've become a star.

18:52.006 --> 18:55.134
Why are you trying

18:52.006 --> 18:55.134
to ruin it for me?

18:55.175 --> 18:56.343
That's it.

18:56.385 --> 18:58.721
I don't even know

18:56.385 --> 18:58.721
you anymore.

Have a great time

18:58.763 --> 19:01.474
with your fruit basket.

what's important to me.

Koji, I've been a real jerk.

19:56.988 --> 19:58.698
I wouldn't say that.

19:58.739 --> 20:01.283
Oh, c'mon, man.

19:58.739 --> 20:01.283
I let this thing go to my head.

And the most important

20:01.325 --> 20:02.869
thing in my life

Okay. You're a jerk.

- You're right.

20:11.085 --> 20:13.379
- Big jerk.

20:14.922 --> 20:16.256
You're right, Koji.

20:16.298 --> 20:19.010
- Major jerk.

20:16.298 --> 20:19.010
- Alright, I got the point.

20:19.052 --> 20:20.887
I gotta get, I gotta get..

20:19.052 --> 20:20.887
I gotta catch her.

20:20.928 --> 20:24.849
I mean, she's probably halfway

20:20.928 --> 20:24.849
to the airport.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.559
What took you so long?

20:27.393 --> 20:29.436
[dramatic music]

20:33.649 --> 20:34.859
I'm sorry sweetheart.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.736
I mean, this whole thing

20:34.901 --> 20:36.736
went to my head.

20:36.777 --> 20:38.196
If I don't have the respect

20:36.777 --> 20:38.196
of my family

20:38.237 --> 20:39.530
then I don't want

20:38.237 --> 20:39.530
any of this, okay?

20:39.572 --> 20:40.740
Forget about this whole tour.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.324

20:40.781 --> 20:42.324

No, jess, don't, don't do that.

20:42.366 --> 20:46.037
Don't throw it all away.

You've worked very hard

20:46.079 --> 20:47.914
for your success.

20:47.955 --> 20:50.374
You should

20:47.955 --> 20:50.374
be proud of yourself.

20:50.416 --> 20:52.459
I know that I am.

we gonna do?

21:43.010 --> 21:46.889
forever to get to Japan.

Why don't you dig

21:46.931 --> 21:50.977
for a while?

Hey, Comet,

22:00.820 --> 22:03.489
take five.

22:03.530 --> 22:06.033
Uncle Jesse,

22:03.530 --> 22:06.033
you're home!

22:06.075 --> 22:07.493
Whoa. Whoa.

22:10.079 --> 22:11.371
I missed you.

22:11.413 --> 22:13.249
I missed you.

22:13.291 --> 22:16.085
You were gone

22:13.291 --> 22:16.085
a really long time.

22:16.127 --> 22:17.711
I was going to be gone

22:16.127 --> 22:17.711
a really, really long time.

22:17.753 --> 22:19.255
They wanted me

22:17.753 --> 22:19.255
to stay a year.

22:19.297 --> 22:21.174
I wouldn't like that.

22:21.215 --> 22:22.300
Me, either.

22:22.341 --> 22:23.509
So, Becky and I got together

22:23.550 --> 22:25.219
and we asked ourself

22:23.550 --> 22:25.219
a question.

22:25.261 --> 22:27.221
Where is the best place

22:25.261 --> 22:27.221
in the whole entire world

22:27.263 --> 22:28.514
to raise Nicky and Alex?

22:28.555 --> 22:30.891
- Right here.

22:28.555 --> 22:30.891
- You are right.

22:30.933 --> 22:32.935
And who is the all-time

22:30.933 --> 22:32.935
greatest

22:32.977 --> 22:34.561
munchkin cousin

22:32.977 --> 22:34.561
they could ever have?

22:34.603 --> 22:35.896
That'd be me.

22:35.938 --> 22:37.731
You're correct, sir.

22:37.773 --> 22:40.734
And who's the greatest ice-cream

22:37.773 --> 22:40.734
eating partner of all time?

22:40.776 --> 22:42.778
That's me again.

22:42.820 --> 22:43.988
You're on a roll.

22:44.030 --> 22:46.157
This is unbelievable.

22:48.784 --> 22:51.245
Come on, let's go

22:48.784 --> 22:51.245

22:51.287 --> 22:52.330
Yeah.

22:52.370 --> 22:53.580
[dramatic music]

22:53.622 --> 22:56.334
I'm glad you're home,

22:53.622 --> 22:56.334
