Previously on
the <i>"Secret Circle"...</i>

00:01.789 --> 00:02.802
What is that?

00:02.827 --> 00:04.027
A power totem.

00:04.175 --> 00:06.393
Draws away weakness
to intensify your strength.

00:06.395 --> 00:07.995
Put this under your bed
for a few weeks,

00:07.997 --> 00:09.913
and you'll be left with nothing
but pure power.

00:11.149 --> 00:12.950
I'm Eva,
Lee's girlfriend.

00:12.952 --> 00:14.585
You told me the devil's crack
destroyed her.

00:14.587 --> 00:16.536
But then she got better
and came back here.

00:16.538 --> 00:18.171
Look, Faye,
it's complicated.

00:20.008 --> 00:22.209
I came back from the dead
for you.

00:22.211 --> 00:24.244
You can't
just dump me.

00:28.650 --> 00:30.100
My name is
Calvin Wilson.

00:30.102 --> 00:32.853
You're in danger.
Remember this?

00:32.855 --> 00:35.755
I had a feeling
you'd try to be a hero.

00:38.559 --> 00:42.479
My son and your daughter
are written in the stars.

00:42.481 --> 00:44.698
Written in the stars
isn't just destiny.

00:44.700 --> 00:46.533
It's a curse.

01:15.179 --> 01:16.596
Hi.

01:19.867 --> 01:21.151
What?

01:23.488 --> 01:26.323
You're just
so beautiful.

01:29.360 --> 01:31.745
You wanna do
some circle magic

01:31.747 --> 01:33.430
and try and stop time?

01:33.432 --> 01:35.832
Mm, well,
that's tempting.

01:35.834 --> 01:39.202
But then we'd be stuck
in this bed forever.

01:39.204 --> 01:42.172
We'd find
something to do.

01:45.426 --> 01:50.113
I keep thinking about the first time
we did magic together...

01:50.115 --> 01:53.517
How it felt
when you touched my hand.

01:53.519 --> 01:54.667
I know.

01:57.138 --> 02:00.774
Then after that, I just couldn't stop
thinking about you...

02:02.343 --> 02:04.111
About...

02:04.113 --> 02:05.696
This.

02:06.581 --> 02:09.366
So how's the real thing
working for you?

02:43.068 --> 02:45.852
My dark magic did this?

02:45.854 --> 02:47.720
Not your magic,

02:47.722 --> 02:50.140
you and Adam.

02:50.142 --> 02:51.608
Us?

02:51.610 --> 02:53.726
How. It's not like
we were sitting around,

02:53.728 --> 02:54.945
casting
dead bird spells.

02:54.947 --> 02:56.580
No, I suspect you two

02:56.582 --> 02:58.832
were engaged
in other activities.

03:00.218 --> 03:02.452
Oh, God.

03:04.088 --> 03:06.540
How could we have anything
to do with this?

03:06.542 --> 03:09.126
What you did
unleashed a curse.

03:09.128 --> 03:10.260
What curse?

03:10.262 --> 03:13.380
The one placed on your 2 families
a long time ago

03:13.382 --> 03:16.233
to stop the Blakes and the Conants
from ever being together.

03:16.235 --> 03:17.501
That's crazy.

03:17.503 --> 03:18.518
Why do you
think this?

03:18.520 --> 03:20.470
Your mother
told me about it.

03:21.973 --> 03:23.723
The birds
are a harbinger,

03:23.725 --> 03:27.394
a sign that the curse
has been activated.

03:27.396 --> 03:29.729
You don't believe
this is true, right?

03:29.731 --> 03:30.781
I--I don't know.

03:30.783 --> 03:32.399
There's a hundred
dead birds on my lawn.

03:32.401 --> 03:33.900
Ok, but then why--
why would my dad

03:33.902 --> 03:35.935
make such a big deal about
our destiny being connected,

03:35.937 --> 03:37.537
written in the stars?

03:37.539 --> 03:39.906
Maybe she
didn't tell him.

03:39.908 --> 03:41.975
I don't know the details
of the curse,

03:41.977 --> 03:45.328
just that it scared your mother
enough to drive her away.

03:46.647 --> 03:48.298
The only other person
she would have

03:48.300 --> 03:49.499
confided in
is your grandmother.

03:49.501 --> 03:50.467
My grandmother,

03:50.469 --> 03:52.118
she's not
in good shape.

03:52.120 --> 03:53.637
Well, we have to try.

03:53.639 --> 03:55.472
Sooner we talk to her,
the better,

03:55.474 --> 03:56.807
and in the meantime...

03:56.809 --> 04:00.010
Don't do anything
to make it worse.

04:07.185 --> 04:09.152
Lee.

04:10.804 --> 04:13.406
Lee!

04:16.611 --> 04:17.944
Lee is out.

04:17.946 --> 04:19.245
What are you doing here?

04:19.248 --> 04:20.930
I have a key,

04:20.933 --> 04:24.367
so I'm not breaking
and entering like you are.

04:24.369 --> 04:27.153
Did he talk to you yet?

04:27.155 --> 04:29.656
He said he was struggling
with his feelings

04:29.658 --> 04:31.958
and needed
time to think,

04:31.960 --> 04:33.109
and then he
just took off.

04:33.111 --> 04:35.562
That's not what he said
last night.

04:35.564 --> 04:37.514
And since when
does Lee think?

04:37.516 --> 04:39.883
Guess you didn't know him
as well as you thought.

04:39.885 --> 04:41.468
Can you just go now?

04:41.470 --> 04:43.103
I'd like
to be alone.

04:43.105 --> 04:44.221
Lee!

04:44.223 --> 04:45.555
What are you doing?

04:45.557 --> 04:47.657
Lee.

04:47.659 --> 04:49.059
I said go!

04:52.647 --> 04:54.414
What the hell?

04:54.416 --> 04:56.783
You are
seriously psycho.

05:04.408 --> 05:06.359
She threw it at my head.

05:06.361 --> 05:08.361
The girl has
serious anger issues.

05:08.363 --> 05:09.329
Which girl?

05:09.331 --> 05:11.298
Faye had
a run-in with Eva.

05:11.300 --> 05:13.166
She almost killed me.

05:13.168 --> 05:15.418
She claims
Lee left town,

05:15.420 --> 05:17.087
but I think she
did something to him.

05:17.089 --> 05:20.674
Guy got stuck in between
you and his ex at casino night.

05:20.676 --> 05:22.392
You know,
maybe he just bailed.

05:22.394 --> 05:24.344
Then why is
his car still there?

05:24.346 --> 05:26.196
- He took a cab?
- No way.

05:26.198 --> 05:27.497
He worships
that car.

05:27.499 --> 05:30.550
He thinks it makes him
look badass.

05:30.552 --> 05:32.319
We need
to search it.

05:32.321 --> 05:33.436
That's illegal, Faye.

05:33.438 --> 05:35.105
Not if we
don't get caught.

05:35.107 --> 05:36.907
Are you sure
this is about Eva?

05:36.909 --> 05:39.075
- What did I just say?
- It's just...

05:39.077 --> 05:42.779
We both know how obsessed
you can get about a guy.

05:42.781 --> 05:44.197
Maybe you're overreacting.

05:44.199 --> 05:46.917
You weren't there,
Melissa.

05:46.919 --> 05:49.336
Eva was hiding
something from me

05:49.338 --> 05:52.172
behind those
doll eyes and creepy voice.

05:52.990 --> 05:55.709
When do I ever
ask you two for help?

06:09.089 --> 06:10.590
Grandma.

06:13.978 --> 06:16.196
Hey.

06:16.198 --> 06:17.864
Amelia?

06:17.866 --> 06:20.367
No, it's Cassie,
remember?

06:20.369 --> 06:22.068
Oh, of course, sweetheart.

06:22.070 --> 06:23.286
Ohh.

06:25.957 --> 06:29.659
Honestly, Amelia, why would you
bring him here?

06:30.711 --> 06:32.963
Come on.
Let's go sit.

06:36.950 --> 06:40.837
I--I wanted to ask you
something important

06:40.839 --> 06:43.473
about the Conants
and the Blakes...

06:43.475 --> 06:45.175
and a curse.

06:45.177 --> 06:48.395
Why do you keep
torturing yourself about this?

06:48.397 --> 06:51.448
I wish you would
reconsider and tell Ethan.

06:51.450 --> 06:54.133
It's too dangerous not to.

06:54.135 --> 06:58.121
It's just I don't remember
all the details.

06:58.123 --> 07:00.523
Several generations ago,

07:00.525 --> 07:03.760
a seer witch cursed
the Conants and the Blakes

07:03.762 --> 07:06.663
to stop them from
ever coming together.

07:06.665 --> 07:08.531
Why? Why would
someone do that?

07:08.533 --> 07:10.350
Jealousy.

07:10.352 --> 07:15.722
And what if a Conant and a Blake
did get together?

07:15.724 --> 07:17.290
Please tell me
you and Ethan didn't.

07:17.292 --> 07:20.093
No. Uh...

07:20.095 --> 07:22.078
But what if we did?

07:22.080 --> 07:23.680
Then you would
awaken the curse,

07:23.682 --> 07:25.598
and you can never
let that happen.

07:25.600 --> 07:27.517
Why?

07:27.519 --> 07:30.553
Because if you
awaken the curse,

07:30.555 --> 07:33.273
someone in your circle
will die.

07:37.032 --> 07:38.431
Who'd you
piss off now?

07:38.516 --> 07:39.632
It was
before our time.

07:39.634 --> 07:41.384
A witch put a curse
on our families.

07:41.386 --> 07:42.868
What kind
of curse?

07:42.870 --> 07:45.771
Apparently to keep our
families from coming together.

07:45.773 --> 07:49.825
Last night,
we activated it.

07:49.827 --> 07:51.861
Ohh.

07:51.863 --> 07:53.996
So you two
finally graduated

07:53.998 --> 07:56.465
from hand-holding
and smooching.

07:56.467 --> 07:57.950
Congrats.

07:57.952 --> 07:59.952
What does that mean
for any of us?

07:59.954 --> 08:01.721
It affects
the whole circle.

08:01.723 --> 08:03.322
- How?
- My grandmother said

08:03.324 --> 08:06.459
that one of us
might die.

08:06.461 --> 08:07.576
No offense,

08:07.578 --> 08:09.795
but the last time
I saw your grandma,

08:09.797 --> 08:10.830
she was a little--

08:10.832 --> 08:12.431
Faye.
This is no joke.

08:12.433 --> 08:13.733
I have been feeling
kind of tired.

08:13.735 --> 08:15.468
I wasn't feeling
that great this morning.

08:15.470 --> 08:17.219
Uh-uh. No one is dying.

08:17.221 --> 08:19.422
It's just a story
your great-greats

08:19.424 --> 08:22.425
told their kids so they
wouldn't have sex.

08:22.427 --> 08:24.310
It's abstinence education
at work.

08:27.731 --> 08:28.931
Are you two coming?

08:28.933 --> 08:32.183
She's dealing with
psycho-ex drama.

08:34.837 --> 08:36.772
Yeah.

08:39.525 --> 08:41.744
Faye's right.
No one's dying.

08:41.746 --> 08:44.363
I still haven't
heard from Jake.

09:08.588 --> 09:11.157
I was knocking.

09:11.159 --> 09:12.725
Have you been
in bed all day?

09:12.727 --> 09:15.194
I think I'm coming down
with something.

09:15.196 --> 09:17.663
Had a fever all morning

09:17.665 --> 09:19.899
and weird dreams.

09:22.786 --> 09:23.953
Hey.

09:25.705 --> 09:27.757
What is that?

09:27.759 --> 09:29.792
I have no idea.

09:34.631 --> 09:35.831
What?

09:35.833 --> 09:38.167
We need to talk.

09:39.903 --> 09:41.253
It's a curse.

09:41.255 --> 09:42.621
On our families.

09:42.623 --> 09:45.091
If a Blake and a Conant...

09:48.979 --> 09:51.280
If a Blake
and a Conant what?

09:51.282 --> 09:53.065
Uh...

09:56.603 --> 09:59.105
How am I
dragged into this?

09:59.107 --> 10:04.026
The curse is someone
in the circle could die.

10:04.028 --> 10:06.412
Whatever it is,
we will find a way

10:06.414 --> 10:07.696
to keep it
from spreading.

10:07.698 --> 10:09.314
Took a curse
to figure out

10:09.316 --> 10:11.183
being with Adam was
a colossal mistake?

10:11.185 --> 10:15.087
Hey. I think I found
the way to fix this.

10:15.089 --> 10:18.090
This is a recipe
for an elixir

10:18.092 --> 10:19.875
that Amelia
tracked down.

10:19.877 --> 10:22.428
I think this'll
break the curse.

10:22.430 --> 10:25.381
If she had an elixir,
why didn't she use it?

10:25.383 --> 10:27.016
- I don't know.
- Who cares?

10:27.018 --> 10:29.185
Let's
just do it.

10:29.187 --> 10:30.519
These are
rare ingredients.

10:30.521 --> 10:33.305
But there is a, uh--
a dealer in town,

10:33.307 --> 10:35.307
Calvin Wilson,

10:35.309 --> 10:36.559
owns an antiquities shop.

10:36.561 --> 10:39.061
We must have something at
the abandoned house.

10:39.063 --> 10:41.614
My brother grew a lot
of weird plants.

10:41.616 --> 10:43.899
I think Calvin's
our best option.

10:49.122 --> 10:51.360
This is the first time
you've invited me over

10:51.385 --> 10:52.816
since I saved your life.

10:53.828 --> 10:55.694
Not even
a thank-you card.

10:55.696 --> 10:58.298
No, instead I decided
to return the favor

10:58.323 --> 10:59.523
and save yours.

11:00.001 --> 11:02.001
John Blackwell
is alive and well

11:02.003 --> 11:03.719
and strutting around
Chance Harbor.

11:03.721 --> 11:05.504
Really?

11:06.473 --> 11:08.040
You're not surprised.

11:08.042 --> 11:10.209
Well, I always had
a nagging suspicion

11:10.211 --> 11:14.013
that his death was
too good to be true.

11:14.015 --> 11:15.681
Well, we need
to deal with it.

11:15.683 --> 11:16.649
Do we?

11:16.651 --> 11:19.318
It took you a week
to tell me

11:19.320 --> 11:22.188
that John Blackwell had
arisen from the dead,

11:22.190 --> 11:26.058
and I wouldn't be standing here
unless you needed something,

11:26.060 --> 11:27.526
so what's wrong, Dawn?

11:27.528 --> 11:30.462
This homecoming didn't go as well
as you'd always dreamed?

11:30.464 --> 11:34.083
I got a call from my source
at the Landsdown Clinic.

11:34.085 --> 11:37.953
Jane had a visitor today,
Blackwell.

11:39.306 --> 11:41.473
If Jane starts
remembering things,

11:41.475 --> 11:45.744
it won't take him long to
connect us to her and Henry.

11:45.746 --> 11:48.864
Now, we are so close
to getting our power back,

11:48.866 --> 11:51.967
but we need him
on our side.

11:55.473 --> 11:57.773
I'll never be
on the same side

11:57.775 --> 12:00.459
as John Blackwell
again.

12:00.461 --> 12:03.045
Let's not forget
who killed Amelia.

12:03.047 --> 12:05.648
And if John
figures that out,

12:05.650 --> 12:08.135
not even your precious
little crystal will stop him

12:08.160 --> 12:10.118
from destroying you.

12:13.440 --> 12:14.439
Hello?

12:14.441 --> 12:16.575
Hi.

12:16.577 --> 12:18.994
We're here
to see Calvin.

12:18.996 --> 12:21.046
My Uncle's not here.

12:21.048 --> 12:22.715
Do you know when
he's going to be back?

12:22.717 --> 12:25.000
He's been missing
for months.

12:25.002 --> 12:27.052
I'm sorry
to hear that.

12:27.054 --> 12:29.388
But I'm sure
I can help you.

12:29.390 --> 12:32.224
This is what we need.

12:38.481 --> 12:40.516
Come with me.

12:47.357 --> 12:49.992
We have everything
but lethe root.

12:49.994 --> 12:51.360
It's very rare.

12:51.362 --> 12:53.195
Does it
grow around here?

12:53.197 --> 12:54.496
Used to,
in Harbor Woods.

12:54.498 --> 12:56.782
Might still be able to still
find some if you, uh,

12:56.784 --> 12:57.750
go deep enough.

12:57.752 --> 12:59.201
It mostly grows
inside trees

12:59.203 --> 13:01.203
hollowed out
by rot or age.

13:01.205 --> 13:02.204
All right.

13:02.206 --> 13:03.756
Cassie and I will go.

13:03.758 --> 13:04.790
And we'll
put the rest

13:04.792 --> 13:05.958
of the ingredients
together

13:05.960 --> 13:07.593
and get
the elixir ready.

13:10.430 --> 13:13.182
I-I'll go with you.

13:13.184 --> 13:16.268
I really want to make sure
that we find this root.

13:16.270 --> 13:17.970
Are you sure
that's a good idea?

13:17.972 --> 13:21.273
If only you'd asked
yourself that last night.

13:21.275 --> 13:22.558
Let it go.

13:33.186 --> 13:34.820
Calvin?

13:40.660 --> 13:41.927
Well?

13:41.929 --> 13:43.462
You coming
or what?

14:00.701 --> 14:01.667
This is his.

14:02.249 --> 14:03.748
Are you sure
Eva's not home?

14:03.750 --> 14:05.417
You know what?
I don't care.

14:05.419 --> 14:06.535
Let's check the trunk.

14:06.537 --> 14:08.370
That's where people
hide dead bodies, right?

14:08.372 --> 14:11.006
♪ ...and make off
like speedy Gonzales... ♪

14:11.008 --> 14:12.841
Lock, unlock.

14:12.843 --> 14:15.594
♪ Ah, yeah, ah, yeah,
think I'm on fire... ♪

14:15.596 --> 14:17.929
See? Just a bunch
of voodoo stuff.

14:17.931 --> 14:19.965
I don't think
that's Lee.

14:19.967 --> 14:21.349
♪ Don't make me
hate this... ♪

14:21.351 --> 14:22.350
So can we go now?

14:22.352 --> 14:24.219
I need to check inside.

14:24.221 --> 14:26.354
Bloody gloves, tools--

14:26.356 --> 14:29.925
bet this car's
filled with clues.

14:29.927 --> 14:32.227

14:33.596 --> 14:35.930
Uhh.

14:35.932 --> 14:37.098
Ow.

14:45.908 --> 14:47.342
Oh, guys, guys.

14:47.344 --> 14:49.361
Don't say or do
anything stupid.

14:49.363 --> 14:52.113
Like break
into a car?

14:53.449 --> 14:55.584
Hello, officer.

14:55.586 --> 14:58.803
Ladies,
is this your car?

14:58.805 --> 15:00.021
It's mine.
It's mine.

15:00.023 --> 15:03.341
Ok. Let's see
some registration.

15:03.343 --> 15:04.893
We can explain. Uh...

15:04.895 --> 15:08.680
Officer, do you mind if
I talk to you, um, privately?

15:08.682 --> 15:12.800
Um, my friend is
kind of a...

15:12.802 --> 15:14.920
distraught
ex-girlfriend.

15:14.922 --> 15:16.454
What is she doing?

15:16.456 --> 15:17.822
Landing us
in jail.

15:17.824 --> 15:20.575
We just kind of brought her
here for some closure.

15:20.577 --> 15:23.612
Why isn't she using
the sexy card?

15:23.614 --> 15:24.646
She's--she's not
psycho or anything.

15:24.648 --> 15:25.864
I mean, everything's
gonna be fine.

15:25.866 --> 15:27.048
Maybe she
needs a push.

15:27.050 --> 15:29.918
But actually he didn't even
lock the car,

15:29.920 --> 15:31.870
so technically
we didn't even break in.

15:41.964 --> 15:42.997
What were
you thinking?

15:42.999 --> 15:43.965
It was Melissa's idea.

15:43.967 --> 15:45.383
I'm sorry. I thought
it would work.

15:45.385 --> 15:47.469
Do you want to lock-unlock
our way out of here?

15:47.471 --> 15:49.170
At least we know
that works.

15:49.172 --> 15:50.272
And then what?

15:50.274 --> 15:51.473
We get shot in the back

15:51.475 --> 15:53.091
for fleeing
from the scene of a crime?

15:53.093 --> 15:55.460
He's not
gonna shoot us.

15:56.429 --> 15:58.363
I don't think.

15:58.365 --> 16:02.284
Just when I think it
can't get any worse.

16:05.454 --> 16:08.456
Ok, ladies.
You can go.

16:15.214 --> 16:16.214
Thank you.

16:16.216 --> 16:18.383
Yeah, thanks.

16:18.385 --> 16:19.834
Don't worry
about it.

16:19.836 --> 16:22.470
Faye and I
both care about Lee.

16:22.472 --> 16:24.456
I understand
how upset she feels.

16:24.458 --> 16:26.758
He wouldn't just
leave his car here.

16:26.760 --> 16:28.660
He took
his motorcycle.

16:30.329 --> 16:33.231
I forgot about
his motorcycle.

16:34.066 --> 16:35.934
We're sorry
for bothering you.

16:35.936 --> 16:38.520
We'll leave you
alone now, right, Faye?

16:49.115 --> 16:51.499
You two
as cold as I am?

16:51.501 --> 16:53.034
- Yes.
- Yes.

16:54.754 --> 16:56.621
Maybe
we're all dying.

16:56.623 --> 16:59.541
You know, you can
still go back to town.

16:59.543 --> 17:00.925
We don't mind at all.

17:00.927 --> 17:05.079
And miss out on this amazing
bonding opportunity? No.

17:05.080 --> 17:07.182
So tell me,

17:07.184 --> 17:10.251
how was
your first time?

17:12.021 --> 17:14.271
Was it sweet
and romantic,

17:14.273 --> 17:16.273
or did little
miss bad girl

17:16.276 --> 17:17.525
bring her
nasty game?

17:17.527 --> 17:18.977
I don't care
if you're sick.

17:18.979 --> 17:20.944
- No thanks to you, buddy.
- Stop it.

17:22.565 --> 17:24.199
Why are you doing this?

17:24.201 --> 17:26.867
Just trying to make
conversation.

17:26.869 --> 17:28.118
Shouldn't you
be more excited

17:28.121 --> 17:31.322
to talk about this
wondrous event?

17:31.324 --> 17:33.158
You're jealous.

17:34.076 --> 17:36.578
Deep down, you know
that it's you and me

17:36.580 --> 17:37.712
that should
be together.

17:37.714 --> 17:39.748
You're wrong.

17:39.750 --> 17:42.167
I know you don't
believe that.

17:42.169 --> 17:43.551
Guys, let's go.

17:46.505 --> 17:48.807
Hold on.
I need some water.

17:55.731 --> 17:57.232
What the hell?

17:57.234 --> 17:59.267
What? What's wrong now?

17:59.269 --> 18:01.135
This.

18:01.137 --> 18:02.921
It's a witch cruet.

18:02.923 --> 18:04.322
Who put this
in my bag?!

18:04.324 --> 18:05.490
What are you
talking about?

18:05.492 --> 18:07.192
Did you get this
from Calvin's?!

18:07.194 --> 18:09.411
Is this some kind
of a sick joke?!

18:09.413 --> 18:12.414
I'm not a witch hunter
anymore!

18:12.416 --> 18:14.532
Jake...

18:16.919 --> 18:19.003
This is not
a witch cruet.

18:19.447 --> 18:20.647
He's losing it.

18:29.181 --> 18:32.100
Oh, he's burning up.

18:32.102 --> 18:34.352
We have to hurry.

18:39.191 --> 18:40.975
Just a minute.

18:44.029 --> 18:46.147
Young lady, do you
really want a job?

18:46.149 --> 18:47.115
Hello, Jane.

18:47.117 --> 18:49.016
Yes, I do.
I do very much.

18:49.018 --> 18:51.986
It's Dawn and Charles.
You remember us?

18:53.272 --> 18:55.590
You're
Amelia's friends.

18:56.826 --> 18:58.576
Yes. That's right.

18:58.578 --> 19:00.462
Amelia's not here.

19:00.464 --> 19:03.197
She'll be back
anytime.

19:03.199 --> 19:05.667
Thank you, Jane, but we
actually came to see you.

19:16.712 --> 19:18.730
That should do it.

19:20.215 --> 19:23.535
Jane, you had a visitor today,
John Blackwell.

19:23.537 --> 19:25.019
Yes.

19:25.021 --> 19:28.106
What did you and John
talk about?

19:29.775 --> 19:31.776
He doesn't look good.

19:34.864 --> 19:36.247
What?

19:36.249 --> 19:38.833
It's just last night
was so amazing.

19:38.835 --> 19:41.920
I can't believe
something so horrible

19:41.922 --> 19:43.872
happened
because of us.

19:43.874 --> 19:45.590
It's not our fault.

19:45.592 --> 19:48.092
Blame the witch who
cursed our families.

19:49.628 --> 19:50.745
You ok, Jake?

19:50.747 --> 19:51.746
I'm fine.

19:51.748 --> 19:54.349
Murderer.

19:54.351 --> 19:56.684
Shut up. Shut up.

19:59.555 --> 20:01.105
Jake?

20:08.764 --> 20:10.698
You killed me, Jake.

20:11.867 --> 20:13.902
Now I'll
watch you die.

20:13.904 --> 20:16.154
You stay away
from me, Calvin.

20:16.156 --> 20:18.406
What? It's me, Adam.

20:18.408 --> 20:20.575
You turned me to ash.

20:20.577 --> 20:22.794
Now you're
going to burn.

20:22.796 --> 20:25.580
I was just doing what the
witch hunters told me to do.

20:25.582 --> 20:29.116
You enjoyed it.
You're a killer.

20:29.118 --> 20:30.418
I had no choice!

20:30.420 --> 20:31.419
Stop it!

20:31.421 --> 20:32.503
I had no choice!

20:39.595 --> 20:40.962
No!

20:40.964 --> 20:42.347
Cassie, Cassie, no!

20:42.349 --> 20:43.731
Cassie, no!

20:43.733 --> 20:45.066
No dark magic!

20:48.520 --> 20:50.688
Focus on me.
Look at me.

21:04.954 --> 21:06.153
Are you ok?

21:06.155 --> 21:07.422
Yeah. Are you?

21:07.424 --> 21:08.590
Yeah.

21:10.526 --> 21:12.427
He thought
I was Calvin Wilson.

21:12.429 --> 21:13.595
I know.

21:14.930 --> 21:16.214
Jake killed him.

21:23.431 --> 21:25.266
Is this what
you're looking for?

21:26.584 --> 21:28.469
It's perfect.
Thank you.

21:28.471 --> 21:30.387
I'm impressed
you get costus root

21:30.389 --> 21:31.367
to grow
in this climate.

21:31.368 --> 21:33.097
I put a UV light
on it at night.

21:33.693 --> 21:35.025
Good instincts.

21:35.027 --> 21:37.260
Nick showed me
a few things.

21:37.262 --> 21:40.197
I guess
I'm a fast learner.

21:40.199 --> 21:44.401
Ok, I'm gonna need some ash
to strengthen this.

21:44.403 --> 21:46.570
I'll get some
from the fireplace.

21:46.572 --> 21:47.738
Thanks.

21:51.042 --> 21:52.543
You know,
a coffee grinder

21:52.545 --> 21:54.078
would be
a lot faster.

21:55.081 --> 21:56.547
Very creative...

21:56.549 --> 21:58.666
like your mother.

21:59.584 --> 22:03.070
I didn't realize
you knew her that well.

22:03.072 --> 22:05.372
Oh, yeah, we spent
hours in these woods.

22:05.374 --> 22:08.676
She showed me all the plants
with medicinal properties, and...

22:10.545 --> 22:13.263
You meant the world to her.

22:30.832 --> 22:32.282
Got it.

22:33.952 --> 22:35.536
Looks like
you'll live, Jake.

22:35.538 --> 22:39.289
Dealing with Jake's past
was easier when I didn't know it,

22:39.291 --> 22:40.674
but I knew Calvin.

22:40.676 --> 22:43.994
Calvin was trying to help me
when Jake killed him.

22:43.996 --> 22:46.329
You're not the reason
he's dead, Cassie.

22:46.331 --> 22:47.848
That's on Jake.

22:49.300 --> 22:51.001
Thank you.

22:51.003 --> 22:53.771
You know,
for bringing me back

22:53.773 --> 22:55.939
before I hurt Jake...

22:55.941 --> 22:58.025
more.

22:58.027 --> 23:01.729
Using dark power
is getting too easy.

23:01.731 --> 23:04.381
But you stopped...

23:05.200 --> 23:07.201
And that's because
you and me

23:07.203 --> 23:09.787
are stronger
than dark magic

23:09.789 --> 23:11.138
or any of this.

23:42.570 --> 23:43.570
Bitch.

23:43.572 --> 23:46.023
Get away from that.

23:46.025 --> 23:47.691
Nice bike.

23:47.693 --> 23:50.461
Is this the one Lee
rode out of town on?

23:50.463 --> 23:53.363
Fine. You don't
want to talk to me,

23:53.365 --> 23:55.199
let's get that cop
back here.

23:56.201 --> 23:57.367
No!

24:00.922 --> 24:02.372
You have magic.

24:02.374 --> 24:04.208
- Are you a witch?
- No.

24:04.210 --> 24:05.626
What did Lee do to you?

24:05.628 --> 24:08.762
He brought me back
from the brink of death.

24:08.764 --> 24:10.564
What don't you get
about that?

24:10.566 --> 24:11.748
What's wrong with you?

24:11.750 --> 24:13.467
He gave you my power.

24:13.469 --> 24:16.553
Not everything
is about you.

24:16.555 --> 24:18.472
This is, I swear.

24:18.474 --> 24:20.741
Lee used 2 voodoo totems--

24:20.743 --> 24:22.893
one to take my power,
and one to save you--

24:22.895 --> 24:25.529
but then he broke my totem,
and he messed everything up.

24:26.931 --> 24:28.782
So this is your power?

24:28.784 --> 24:31.452
Yes, and you're
not supposed to have it.

24:31.454 --> 24:33.120
This is all Lee's fault.

24:33.122 --> 24:35.172
That's why he ran.

24:35.174 --> 24:36.924
You're a witch?

24:36.926 --> 24:38.175
Yes.

24:39.144 --> 24:42.679
Then maybe you can help me
make things right.

24:42.681 --> 24:44.331
Absolutely.

24:44.333 --> 24:48.669
I did something
with your magic.

24:54.075 --> 24:57.144
But if I used
your power to do it,

24:57.146 --> 24:59.513
you can help me
bring him back.

25:10.025 --> 25:10.992
You killed him.

25:10.994 --> 25:12.904
With your magic,
so fix him.

25:12.907 --> 25:14.490
- I can't.
- Why not?

25:14.492 --> 25:15.491
He's dead!

25:15.493 --> 25:17.660
You're a witch.
Do a spell.

25:17.662 --> 25:19.378
Bring him
back to life.

25:19.380 --> 25:20.612
I'm not God, Eva.

25:20.614 --> 25:22.414
I can't just
make someone live.

25:22.416 --> 25:24.967
I unlock locks,
and I cheat at cards,

25:24.969 --> 25:26.552
and I get
hot pizza guys,

25:26.554 --> 25:29.221
and I can't even do any of that
without someone helping me.

25:29.223 --> 25:31.023
- You're lying.
- I'm not.

25:31.025 --> 25:33.475
What you're asking for
is impossible.

25:33.477 --> 25:35.644
I didn't ask
for any of this.

25:35.646 --> 25:37.730
I don't want your magic.

25:37.732 --> 25:39.565
I just want Lee back.

25:40.767 --> 25:44.303
I'm sorry,
but he's gone.

25:50.910 --> 25:52.644
What are you doing?

25:52.646 --> 25:54.196
Stop!

25:54.198 --> 25:55.197
Stop.

25:55.199 --> 25:58.033
Stop it!

25:58.035 --> 26:00.336
Then help me
bring back Lee.

26:03.990 --> 26:05.507
Ok. Ok.

26:15.635 --> 26:17.603
I can't guarantee
this is gonna save him.

26:19.973 --> 26:22.391
Thank you
for your guidance,

26:22.393 --> 26:24.476
for everything.

26:28.732 --> 26:31.400
There's something
you need to know.

26:38.875 --> 26:43.361
Ok, we both need to, um...

26:43.363 --> 26:46.165
kneel on either side
of Lee's body.

26:46.167 --> 26:48.500
Are you sure
this is gonna work?

26:48.502 --> 26:50.369
You said
it was impossible.

26:50.371 --> 26:53.205
That was just my lack
of self-confidence talking,

26:53.207 --> 26:55.707
but I gave myself
a quick pep talk,

26:55.709 --> 26:57.743
and I'm feeling
much better now,

26:57.745 --> 26:58.977
so let's...

26:58.979 --> 27:01.397
raise the dead.

27:05.551 --> 27:07.453
Are you messing
with me?

27:07.455 --> 27:13.275
Eva, I'm a very,
very powerful witch.

27:13.277 --> 27:15.327
You should know that
better than anyone.

27:15.329 --> 27:17.496
You've got my power
coursing through your veins.

27:17.498 --> 27:18.630
Ready?

27:18.632 --> 27:21.450
Place your hands
on the bed...

27:23.219 --> 27:25.354
and concentrate.

27:25.356 --> 27:27.005
Close your eyes.

27:37.434 --> 27:39.968
I need you
to chant with me.

27:42.806 --> 27:45.724
Memento moriotum.

27:47.093 --> 27:50.062
Memento moriotun.

27:50.064 --> 27:51.330
Otum.

27:51.332 --> 27:53.398
If you don't
say it right,

27:53.400 --> 27:55.334
it'll never work.

27:55.336 --> 27:58.871
Memento moriotum.

27:58.873 --> 27:59.905
Wait.

27:59.907 --> 28:01.623
I completely forgot.

28:01.625 --> 28:03.125
Candles.

28:03.127 --> 28:05.227
We need candles.
Do you have any?

28:06.713 --> 28:09.364
Do you want
to save Lee or not?

28:34.824 --> 28:37.326
You lying bitch.

28:37.328 --> 28:39.161
There is no spell,
is there?

28:39.163 --> 28:41.146
All you wanted
was this.

28:41.148 --> 28:43.448
Uhh!

28:48.705 --> 28:50.839
This is
all your fault.

28:50.841 --> 28:53.342
Lee would still be alive if he
hadn't met you.

29:07.273 --> 29:08.774
What am I doing?

29:09.609 --> 29:11.410
What do you
think you're doing?

29:11.412 --> 29:13.779
I don't know.

29:22.121 --> 29:25.107
I can't feel
the power anymore.

29:25.109 --> 29:27.326
That's a good thing.

29:27.328 --> 29:28.877
Trust me.

29:30.797 --> 29:33.498
I didn't mean
to kill Lee.

29:33.500 --> 29:37.152
I loved him so much.

30:03.529 --> 30:05.530
Is that it?

30:05.532 --> 30:06.665
Yeah.

30:06.667 --> 30:09.668
Well, let's give it
to him and go.

30:09.670 --> 30:12.087
It's not for Jake.

30:12.089 --> 30:13.872
It's for us.

30:13.874 --> 30:16.458
Because we're at the heart
of the curse,

30:16.460 --> 30:19.461
we're the ones
who have to drink it.

30:19.463 --> 30:20.479
What?

30:20.481 --> 30:21.513
There's more.

30:21.515 --> 30:23.315
That lethe root,

30:23.317 --> 30:25.601
when we drink this,

30:25.603 --> 30:28.570
we'll forget how we
feel about each other.

30:28.572 --> 30:30.606
There's no way. No.

30:30.608 --> 30:33.725
No, we'll remember
everything,

30:33.727 --> 30:36.094
even that
we loved each other.

30:38.231 --> 30:41.183
We just
won't remember why,

30:41.185 --> 30:44.286
and we won't be in love.

30:44.288 --> 30:46.121
That's crazy.
I'm not gonna do it.

30:46.123 --> 30:47.973
There's no other way
to break the curse.

30:47.975 --> 30:50.976
Oh, so we're gonna destroy us
to save a killer.

30:50.978 --> 30:53.045
If we let him die,
then we're the killers,

30:53.047 --> 30:54.463
we're just like him.
No.

30:54.465 --> 30:56.548
Cassie,
being with you

30:56.550 --> 30:58.417
is more important
than anything.

31:05.775 --> 31:07.976
We don't have a choice.

31:12.899 --> 31:15.017
Cassie...

31:15.019 --> 31:17.936
There is no elixir

31:17.938 --> 31:21.940
that can ever let me forget
how much I love you.

31:24.243 --> 31:26.811
Not for long.

31:26.813 --> 31:28.497
I swear.

31:30.783 --> 31:32.501
I know.

32:26.667 --> 32:28.385
You saved my life.

32:30.605 --> 32:32.306
I helped.

32:32.308 --> 32:34.975
Was I hallucinating,
or did Adam and Cassie

32:34.977 --> 32:37.861
just destroy
their relationship...

32:37.863 --> 32:39.446
For me?

32:40.448 --> 32:42.900
You don't think
you're worth the sacrifice?

32:44.119 --> 32:46.904
I know I'm not.

32:52.026 --> 32:54.027
You're 1 of 6.

32:54.029 --> 32:55.629
You matter.

32:57.715 --> 32:59.850
They don't know me.

32:59.852 --> 33:02.252
I killed Calvin.

33:06.508 --> 33:08.375
Well,
that's in the past.

33:10.979 --> 33:13.981
I wish it was,

33:13.983 --> 33:17.551
but the look on Cassie's face
when she found out...

33:18.987 --> 33:21.872
I'm surprised that she
didn't let me die.

33:24.742 --> 33:26.860
I understand...

33:26.862 --> 33:29.163
more than you know.

33:31.199 --> 33:33.066
But a man
can change.

33:36.421 --> 33:38.172
You really believe that?

33:42.210 --> 33:43.760
I do.

33:55.690 --> 33:57.925
Morning.

33:57.927 --> 33:59.293
Hey.

34:04.782 --> 34:06.416
How do you feel?

34:06.418 --> 34:09.235
Weird.

34:09.237 --> 34:11.288
Weird how?

34:12.373 --> 34:15.092
Like I'm not...

34:15.094 --> 34:16.326
nervous.

34:16.328 --> 34:19.730
Nervous? When are
you ever nervous?

34:19.732 --> 34:21.431
When I'm around you.

34:22.734 --> 34:24.751
And when I think
about you

34:24.753 --> 34:28.288
and when I wonder
if I'm good enough for you.

34:31.159 --> 34:33.810
I don't feel
that way right now.

34:36.813 --> 34:38.431
I feel...

34:40.435 --> 34:42.569
Good.

34:45.190 --> 34:46.773
Good's good.

34:46.775 --> 34:49.326
Look, I love seeing you,
love being here,

34:49.328 --> 34:51.478
and I definitely
want to come back

34:51.480 --> 34:54.197
and watch the rest
of "Game of Thrones" with you,

34:54.199 --> 34:56.917
but I don't, um...

34:56.918 --> 34:58.602
"Love me."

35:00.421 --> 35:02.239
This is strange.

35:02.241 --> 35:05.959
I guess--guess
that elixir worked.

35:05.961 --> 35:07.861
I mean...

35:08.763 --> 35:10.797
Do you feel
that way, too?

35:10.799 --> 35:12.966
Exactly.

35:14.954 --> 35:18.572
I remember every minute
we spent together...

35:19.457 --> 35:22.159
But like
it was in a movie...

35:22.161 --> 35:24.645
someone else's
amazing movie.

35:24.647 --> 35:26.013
That's totally it.

35:27.248 --> 35:30.117
Maybe being
written in the stars

35:30.119 --> 35:31.835
didn't mean
what we thought it did.

35:31.837 --> 35:33.904
Maybe we're not
the dating kind of soul mates.

35:33.906 --> 35:35.272
Yeah.

35:35.274 --> 35:36.290
You were right.

35:36.292 --> 35:37.241
Breaking the curse,

35:37.243 --> 35:40.360
that was the most
important thing.

35:40.362 --> 35:41.995
We saved
Jake's life.

35:43.983 --> 35:46.266
I have to open
the boathouse.

35:46.268 --> 35:47.918
Can we just
talk later?

35:47.920 --> 35:49.419
Absolutely.

35:55.009 --> 35:56.176
Bye.

36:08.574 --> 36:10.557
She was so crazy.

36:13.444 --> 36:16.530
And so alone.

36:16.532 --> 36:19.116
I'm so sorry
we didn't believe you.

36:19.118 --> 36:22.586
I'm still kind of
having trouble believing it.

36:22.588 --> 36:24.921
And yet you still
came with me

36:24.923 --> 36:27.124
to help
break into a car.

36:29.577 --> 36:31.261
Thanks.

36:51.282 --> 36:53.617
I still remember
everything.

36:55.403 --> 36:57.537
I still love him.

36:57.539 --> 36:59.873
I'm sorry.

37:02.744 --> 37:04.711
But he doesn't love me.

37:05.830 --> 37:07.698
Your power
must be too strong.

37:07.700 --> 37:09.750
The elixir
only worked on Adam.

37:10.835 --> 37:14.004
You know, I don't feel
very strong right now.

37:26.434 --> 37:27.567
Sorry. I'm sorry.

37:27.569 --> 37:29.486
I had no idea.

37:32.407 --> 37:35.308
He doesn't
love me anymore.

37:39.664 --> 37:43.784
Don't worry, Cassie.
You're going to be ok.

37:45.203 --> 37:48.004
Who knows what might happen
between you and Adam?

37:51.392 --> 37:53.159
Yeah.

37:54.595 --> 37:57.381
I, um--

37:57.383 --> 37:58.899
I think...

38:02.253 --> 38:05.138
Think I just
need to be alone.

38:07.141 --> 38:08.642
Of course.

38:10.845 --> 38:13.480
But I won't be far,

38:13.482 --> 38:15.816
not ever again.

38:40.541 --> 38:41.758
Who are you?

38:44.262 --> 38:45.929
It's me, Jane.

38:45.931 --> 38:48.899
Charles, you scared me.

38:48.901 --> 38:51.435
It's late.
What are you doing here?

38:54.238 --> 38:56.973
I'm here
to make you better.

38:56.975 --> 38:58.725
I'm here to help you

38:58.727 --> 39:00.727
so that you can help me

39:00.729 --> 39:03.563
destroy John Blackwell.

39:14.592 --> 39:17.010
I saw
Jane Blake today.

39:18.179 --> 39:20.630
How nice for her.

39:20.632 --> 39:24.100
There's no such thing
as a Blake-Conant curse.

39:24.102 --> 39:26.887
Amelia would have
told me.

39:26.889 --> 39:28.221
But you still got Jane

39:28.223 --> 39:30.056
to say there was,
to lie.

39:31.192 --> 39:33.527
You manipulated her
with magic, didn't you?

39:33.529 --> 39:35.195
I told you
I don't have--

39:35.197 --> 39:37.147
John, I know
you still have power,

39:37.149 --> 39:39.716
just like I knew
you weren't dead.

39:42.620 --> 39:44.738
You scheming
son of a bitch.

39:44.740 --> 39:46.606
You're driving Adam
and Cassie apart

39:46.608 --> 39:48.825
because you're afraid
of their destiny...

39:49.794 --> 39:53.330
Just like you were afraid of
Amelia and Ethan.

39:57.301 --> 40:01.505
Yes, and did you know
that Ethan and Amelia's love

40:01.507 --> 40:04.674
was so important,
they wanted out of the circle?

40:04.676 --> 40:07.460
He left the boat that day
to run away with her,

40:07.462 --> 40:09.396
and their absence left you

40:09.398 --> 40:12.015
totally defenseless
against the witch hunters.

40:12.017 --> 40:14.017
That massacre
never would have happened

40:14.019 --> 40:15.902
had the circle
worked together.

40:19.657 --> 40:21.942
So you do have magic.

40:21.944 --> 40:24.211
Not enough
to protect Cassie

40:24.213 --> 40:26.646
if her circle's
destroyed.

40:26.648 --> 40:29.082
My magic can fake a curse,

40:29.084 --> 40:32.669
kill birds, spell Jane,
put Jake through agony,

40:32.671 --> 40:35.388
but I can't stop
all the witch hunters.

40:35.390 --> 40:38.041
The hunters are back?

40:38.043 --> 40:39.709
And they're
using magic,

40:39.711 --> 40:42.762
which means one of us
is working with them.

40:42.764 --> 40:44.297
I didn't know.

40:45.299 --> 40:47.984
Don't question me
again, Dawn.

40:49.520 --> 40:52.606
You know you don't
want me as an enemy.
