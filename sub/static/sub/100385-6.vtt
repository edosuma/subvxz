00:34.172 --> 00:36.005
You can't park there.

00:36.089 --> 00:37.881
You don't have a sticker.

00:37.964 --> 00:40.297
-Yeah.
-A handicapped--
This is a handicapped spot.

00:40.381 --> 00:42.297
Yeah, I'm just gonna be
a minute.

00:42.381 --> 00:43.506
Two minutes at the most.

00:43.589 --> 00:45.464
Yeah, I know,
but people coming to use

00:45.547 --> 00:46.839
my son's store, here.

00:46.923 --> 00:48.714
My son Joseph
owns this store,

00:48.798 --> 00:50.422
so you really
can't park there.

00:50.506 --> 00:52.172
So you're Mocha Joe's mom.

00:52.255 --> 00:53.881
Yeah, yeah.
My name's Jane.

-Mocha Jane.
-Yeah, that's me.
Mocha Jane.

00:56.589 --> 00:58.839
But you can't park here,
because it's handicapped.

00:58.923 --> 01:00.339
You know what,
Mocha Jane?

01:00.422 --> 01:01.964
There are no spaces in this lot.

01:02.047 --> 01:04.130
-But it's for handicapped.
-I just have to go into my store

01:04.214 --> 01:05.964

You're Latte Larry!

01:07.631 --> 01:09.214
Oh, I should have known.

01:09.297 --> 01:10.798
Joseph told me about you.

01:10.881 --> 01:14.005
We're gonna take you down,
Latte Larry.

01:14.464 --> 01:17.130
We shall see, Mocha Jane.

01:17.631 --> 01:19.297
We shall see.

01:21.464 --> 01:23.464
Jane:
What is this world coming to?

01:24.047 --> 01:26.464
Hey, do me a favor.
Put those in storage.

01:27.589 --> 01:28.964
Hey, hey.

01:29.756 --> 01:32.047
-Ah. Hello, Freddy.
-Good to see you.

01:32.130 --> 01:35.089
-What brings you here?
-I wanted to see, uh,
the Colosseum

01:35.172 --> 01:36.589
before the gladiators
started fighting.

01:36.673 --> 01:38.631
I got some great things
happening here.

01:38.714 --> 01:40.756
It looks like it.
The bones are great.

01:40.839 --> 01:42.255
We got tables here, okay?

01:42.339 --> 01:44.673
And what are they gonna have
next to them?

01:44.756 --> 01:46.214
A little coat rack.

01:46.297 --> 01:47.631
-For coats. Cool.
-Yeah.

01:47.714 --> 01:49.756
And Purell, every table.

01:49.839 --> 01:51.130
A little squirt,

01:51.214 --> 01:53.047
and you're ready
for your muffin.

01:53.130 --> 01:55.547
Who's coming in?
Howie Mandel and
his family every day?

01:55.631 --> 01:57.172
All right. Okay. Forget that.

01:57.255 --> 01:59.547
Now I want to show you
the thing I'm most proud of.

01:59.631 --> 02:01.005
Freddy:
That's what I want to see.

02:01.756 --> 02:04.381
Larry: Welcome
to the 21st century bathroom.

02:04.464 --> 02:07.381
-Uh-huh. Yep.
-Splash-free.

02:07.464 --> 02:10.297
Larry:
Look. First you got
the snow shoes down there.

02:10.381 --> 02:12.130
You step on those.

02:12.214 --> 02:13.881
See how it lifts up?

02:13.964 --> 02:15.839
-Okay, now, watch this.
-(beeping)

02:15.923 --> 02:17.923
You set it to your level

02:18.005 --> 02:19.964
-of where your penis is.
-Uh-huh.

02:20.047 --> 02:22.464
I feel like I'm with
Howard Hughes right
before the nails go big.

02:22.547 --> 02:24.047
-(laughing)
-No, I do.

02:24.130 --> 02:26.339
-It's cool, though.
-It's, uh, it's quite
an advancement.

02:26.422 --> 02:28.089
-I'm so proud of these boys.
-You should be.

02:28.172 --> 02:29.839
-I am. Look at this.
-And where's the can?

02:29.923 --> 02:31.089
Where's the shitter?

02:31.172 --> 02:32.464
Oh. No such thing.

02:32.547 --> 02:34.172
Well, what if someone has to--
What if somebody has to--

02:34.255 --> 02:35.297
Let 'em go home.

02:35.381 --> 02:37.255
-Then you lose customers.
-Who cares?

02:37.339 --> 02:39.381
I'd rather have
a no-coffee buyer
than a defecator.

02:39.464 --> 02:41.089
How about the ladies?
What do they got?

02:41.172 --> 02:42.714
-Let me show you.
-Okay.

02:45.005 --> 02:47.214
Larry:
Look. Look at this.
Look at this.

02:47.297 --> 02:49.297
Freddy:
See, this is smart.
The ladies get to sit down.

02:49.381 --> 02:52.339
-This makes sense.
-No, no, no. They don't sit.

02:52.422 --> 02:55.547
-They squat.
-I don't get it.

02:55.631 --> 02:57.089
Women don't want to sit.

02:57.172 --> 02:58.589
They're very envious
that we can--

02:58.673 --> 03:00.506
They have--
They have pee envy,
actually.

03:00.589 --> 03:02.673
-Look what
I've done for them.
-Okay.

03:02.756 --> 03:05.005
See? Grab
onto these bars,

03:05.089 --> 03:06.673
then the knees go in here.

03:06.756 --> 03:08.297
They don't touch anything.

03:08.381 --> 03:10.756
They're not touching.
That's what they don't like.

03:10.839 --> 03:12.255
They don't like touching
the toilet.

03:12.339 --> 03:14.130
It's like a Pilates class,
though. Is it hard?

03:14.214 --> 03:16.255
You don't want to go
too much longer than
a pee time.

03:16.339 --> 03:18.089
I wouldn't stay here all day.

03:18.172 --> 03:19.547
And the pants go where?

03:19.631 --> 03:22.172
You know, I don't know.
Whatever they do with them.

03:22.255 --> 03:24.172
Come and join me.
Saddle up.

03:24.255 --> 03:25.464
-You all right? Okay.
-Yeah.

03:25.547 --> 03:26.589
-Just grab on here?
-Yeah.

03:26.673 --> 03:28.089
-Grab on here.
-Let's see how we do it.

03:28.172 --> 03:29.089
Yeah.

03:29.172 --> 03:31.089
-Oh, this one feels good.
-Yeah.

03:31.172 --> 03:33.005
-This is empowering.
-Yeah.

03:33.089 --> 03:36.089
-Just this body position
makes me feel strong. You?
-I'm really getting tired.

03:36.172 --> 03:38.589
-Did you consult
women on this?
-No.

03:38.673 --> 03:40.547
-Freddy:
They'll love this, though.
-Oh, yeah.

03:40.631 --> 03:42.047
-I like the feeling here.
-Yeah. Okay.

03:42.130 --> 03:44.047
-My legs are killing me.
-I gotta get up.

03:44.130 --> 03:46.130
(both grunting, groaning)

03:47.631 --> 03:50.130
You know,
I got one more idea.

03:50.214 --> 03:51.714
-You're kidding me?
-No.

03:51.798 --> 03:53.756
-One more? Okay.
-This is a tremendous idea.

03:53.839 --> 03:56.089
-A cup, okay...
-Mm-hmm.

03:56.172 --> 03:59.297
-...that keeps coffee hot.
-Mm-hmm.

03:59.381 --> 04:02.214
-Like a thermos? No.
-No, not a thermos.
The cup itself...

04:02.297 --> 04:04.089
-Heats. Uh-huh.
-...heats, is hot.

04:04.172 --> 04:05.964
-You got plans?
-There's no plans.

04:06.047 --> 04:08.547
I don't, I don't, you know,
how am I gonna do it?

04:08.631 --> 04:10.339
I'd need an inventor.

04:10.422 --> 04:14.047
I know a guy.
He's like a patent guy,
he's got like 45 patents.

04:14.130 --> 04:16.381
-Really?
-He's a very eccentric
kind of guy.

04:16.464 --> 04:18.297
He's an inventor.
They're supposed to be
eccentric.

04:18.381 --> 04:20.172
Marconi used to go
mountain climbing naked.

04:20.255 --> 04:22.381
-The nuttier the better.
-Freddy: I can text you
his name.

04:22.464 --> 04:23.589
-Thank you.
-You look great.

04:23.673 --> 04:24.923
-Hey, Freddy Funkhouser.
-Hey, how are you?

04:25.005 --> 04:26.798
-Good. The mattress king.
-Great to see you.

04:26.881 --> 04:29.089
-The champ, mattress champ.
-Yeah, knock 'em out
with a one-two punch.

04:29.172 --> 04:30.589
-Right?
-That's right, that's right.
Good to see you.

04:30.673 --> 04:32.881
-Freddy:
All right. See you later.
-See you.

04:33.506 --> 04:34.839
This is it?

04:34.923 --> 04:37.422
-Oh, will you stop it?
-Well, I'm underwhelmed,
Larry.

04:37.506 --> 04:39.673
-I don't give a fuck.
-You've been working on it
for God knows how long.

04:39.756 --> 04:42.339
Where's some color?
You need some pizzazz
in here,

04:42.422 --> 04:45.589
-you want to attract customers.
-Are you... are you through?

04:45.673 --> 04:47.422
All right, look.
I'm here to ask a favor.

04:47.506 --> 04:50.631
I'm having a surprise party
for Jeff for his birthday.

04:50.714 --> 04:52.881
-Oh.
-So, I'm gonna have it
on the 20th,

04:52.964 --> 04:55.255
which is three days
before his birthday.
He'll never know.

04:55.339 --> 04:57.089
But I need you to help
with the ruse.

04:57.172 --> 04:59.756
-First of all,
it's a terrible idea.
-Why?

04:59.839 --> 05:02.172
-Number one,
people hate surprise parties.
-No, no, no, no.

05:02.255 --> 05:04.464
-You, maybe. Everybody I know
loves a surprise party.
-No. Everybody.

05:04.547 --> 05:06.964
-Oh, that's fun?
That's fun? (yells)
-Yes.

05:07.047 --> 05:08.631
-Nobody's doing--
-(both yelling)

05:08.714 --> 05:10.297
-Yeah.
-He's gonna be thrilled.

05:10.381 --> 05:11.631
The guy's got
a heart condition.

05:11.714 --> 05:13.547
We go to the same cardiologist,
Dr. Holzer.

05:13.631 --> 05:15.005
-Oi, that one. Yeah.
-Okay?

05:15.089 --> 05:17.047
Surprises are,
are dangerous!

05:17.130 --> 05:18.464
-He'll be thrilled with it.
-Yeah.

05:18.547 --> 05:19.756
He's gonna love
every minute of it.

05:19.839 --> 05:21.339
-Oh, yeah.
-"Surprise!" He'll be happy.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.798
-He'll be happy?
He'll be dead.
-I wanna have it,

05:23.881 --> 05:25.881
he's gonna love it,
and we're having it. Okay?

05:25.964 --> 05:28.464
You know what? I'm gonna go
talk to Dr. Holzer about this.
We'll see what he says.

05:28.547 --> 05:32.547
-Whatever you want.
You do whatever you want, okay?
-Thank you. Thank you.

05:34.047 --> 05:35.589
How can I help you?

05:35.673 --> 05:38.047
I was wondering if I could
talk to Dr. Holzer.

05:38.130 --> 05:39.631
Okay, do you have
an appointment?

05:39.714 --> 05:41.297
No. No, I don't.

05:42.005 --> 05:44.673
-Are you a patient
of Dr. Holzer's?
-Yes, I am.

05:44.756 --> 05:46.297
Okay. Can you...

05:46.381 --> 05:48.422
-sign your name up on
the sign-up sheet, please?
-Sure.

05:48.506 --> 05:50.214
-Thank you.
-What is this?

05:51.047 --> 05:54.506
Andrew "Rusty" Holzer?

05:54.589 --> 05:56.422
Rusty, in quotes?

05:56.506 --> 05:58.714
Uh, that's the doctor's card.

05:58.798 --> 06:02.005
He put a nickname on the card?
Why's he doing that?

06:02.089 --> 06:05.047
-Well, you may have a seat,
and he'll be right out.
-Okay.

06:05.130 --> 06:07.631
I haven't seen you
around before.
You new?

06:07.714 --> 06:10.130
-Uh, no, I've been here
for a few months.
-Really?

06:10.214 --> 06:12.589
-Eight or nine months or so.
-You like it?

06:13.172 --> 06:14.714
Yeah. Yeah, I like it.

06:14.798 --> 06:17.547
So, for lunch, do you go out
or do you bring something
from home?

06:17.631 --> 06:19.172
Either.

06:19.255 --> 06:21.172
I guess you gotta be
a little careful of
the food you bring in

06:21.255 --> 06:24.381
because sometimes
it has an odor, and it...
it smells up the office.

06:24.464 --> 06:27.673
You know,
like on a plane.
You bring food on a plane?

06:28.464 --> 06:31.964
-Sir, if you'll have a seat,
the doctor will be with you.
-Sure. Sure.

06:32.047 --> 06:33.547
-All right, will do.
-Thank you.

06:33.631 --> 06:34.923
Hey. Am I crazy?

06:35.005 --> 06:37.047
Or did you get
some new artwork in here?

06:37.130 --> 06:40.005
Uh, yeah, we made
a few changes around
the beginning of the year.

06:40.089 --> 06:42.756
Yeah. I'm not crazy
about this painting,
you know.

06:42.839 --> 06:45.631
What, what do you think
of that painting?

06:46.297 --> 06:48.631
-(clears throat)
-Larry: Oh, I know that face.

06:48.714 --> 06:50.589
That's, "Oh, you're
coming onto me."

06:50.673 --> 06:53.047
I'm not coming onto you.
I'm not hitting on you.

06:53.130 --> 06:56.464
Everything's not a hit.
People can make conversations
without it being a hit.

06:56.547 --> 06:58.297
The whole world is not a hit.

06:58.381 --> 07:00.714
Okay. Have a seat. Thank you.

07:00.798 --> 07:03.631
It's good to see you, Larry.
What, uh...

07:03.714 --> 07:05.047
Everything okay?
What brings you here?

07:05.130 --> 07:07.255
First, I want to ask you
about this card.

07:07.339 --> 07:09.714
-Mm-hmm.
-"Rusty"?

07:09.798 --> 07:11.923
Andrew "Rusty" Holzer?

07:12.005 --> 07:14.172
I'm trying it out.
Rusty. It's a nickname.

07:14.255 --> 07:16.881
-Who gives
themselves a nickname?
-I'm just trying it. It's new.

07:16.964 --> 07:19.255
Most people are given
nicknames

07:19.339 --> 07:21.756
for some personality quirk
or trait.

07:21.839 --> 07:23.881
If you ate a lot of
peaches one day,

07:23.964 --> 07:26.214
when you were a kid
and, and you threw up,

07:26.297 --> 07:28.923
-maybe you'd be called "Peaches"
for the rest of your life.
-(laughs)

07:29.005 --> 07:31.047
Where, where'd you
come up with "Rusty"?

07:31.130 --> 07:32.422
I feel like a Rusty.

07:32.506 --> 07:34.464
-Okay. Um...
-Good enough.

07:34.547 --> 07:36.297
The reason I'm here
is that, uh...

07:36.381 --> 07:38.255
Susie Greene,
Jeff Greene's wife,

07:38.339 --> 07:40.631
is throwing a surprise party
for him on the 20th,

07:40.714 --> 07:42.422
and I'm very concerned

07:42.506 --> 07:44.964
-his heart might not
be able to take...
-Mm.

07:45.047 --> 07:46.631
...that element
of surprise--

07:46.714 --> 07:48.297
(yells): Surprise! You know,
everybody jumps out.

07:48.381 --> 07:50.464
-(yells) It's scary!
You know?
-Right, right.

07:50.547 --> 07:52.047
Yeah. I can see that.

07:52.130 --> 07:54.589
Given the condition
of his heart,

07:54.673 --> 07:57.839
I just want to see
if you're giving that
the okay.

07:57.923 --> 07:59.130
Yeah, I wouldn't be
comfortable

07:59.214 --> 08:01.089
unless there was a, you know,

08:01.172 --> 08:03.214
a qualified physician,

08:03.297 --> 08:04.839
uh, in attendance.

08:04.923 --> 08:06.798
-Where's the party?
-Scopa.

08:06.881 --> 08:08.631
-Scopa?
-Yeah.

08:08.714 --> 08:10.506
Oh, that's hard to get into.
That's a trendy spot.

08:10.589 --> 08:13.255
-You know, he's a manager,
he knows a lot of celebrities.
-Oh.

08:13.339 --> 08:15.714
Chris Martin's gonna,
he's gonna sing.

08:15.798 --> 08:18.089
-(laughs) Chris Martin?
-Yeah.

08:18.172 --> 08:19.923
-Wow.
-You like Coldplay?

08:20.005 --> 08:21.339
Cold-- Oh, I love...

08:21.422 --> 08:22.798
-I mean that, that's big.
-Yeah.

08:22.881 --> 08:24.714
-They're great. Yeah.
-That's a lot of pressure.

08:24.798 --> 08:26.964
Yeah, I don't feel good
about this.

08:27.047 --> 08:28.839
The surprise party,
wouldn't do it.

08:28.923 --> 08:30.923
-No. Not safe.
-Huh.

08:31.005 --> 08:32.923
And suppose...

08:33.005 --> 08:34.798
you were invited to this?

08:34.881 --> 08:37.714
-Would you have
a different opinion?
-Oh.

08:37.798 --> 08:41.089
-I hadn't,
I hadn't thought of that.
-Yeah. Sure.

08:41.172 --> 08:43.714
-I mean, if I,
if I came to the party?
-Yes, yes, yes.

08:43.798 --> 08:46.130
-Saturday, the 20th.
-Scopa.

08:46.631 --> 08:48.923
That's a good idea.
I mean, that changes things.

08:49.422 --> 08:51.172
I'll talk to Susie.

08:51.255 --> 08:53.673
Hopefully, we can, uh...

08:53.756 --> 08:55.089
snare you an invite.

08:55.172 --> 08:56.339
Oh. Good enough.

08:56.422 --> 08:58.047
-Thank you so much.
-Hey, my pleas--

08:58.130 --> 09:00.464
-You let me know.
You keep me posted.
-I certainly will,

09:00.547 --> 09:02.631
-and, uh, I'll be
talking to Susie.
-Okay. Okay.

09:02.714 --> 09:04.089
-Okay?
-Thank you, Larry.

09:04.172 --> 09:05.547
-Uh-- Of course.
-Larry: May I use your bathroom?

09:05.631 --> 09:07.547
-Thank you.
-Uh, all right.

09:10.547 --> 09:12.923
Man: Be right back.
I'm just gonna use
the bathroom real quick.

09:29.005 --> 09:31.297
♪ ♪

09:41.464 --> 09:42.631
(lock clicks)

09:48.464 --> 09:50.089
Hi.

09:50.172 --> 09:52.839
-Hi.
-Why did you pass me?

09:53.339 --> 09:54.756
Well... (sighs)

09:54.839 --> 09:56.547
I calculated your speed,

09:56.631 --> 10:00.130
my speed, the distance,
my average urination time,

10:00.214 --> 10:01.756
and according
to my calculations,

10:01.839 --> 10:03.631
I would have had to wait
three to four minutes,

10:03.714 --> 10:05.881
whereas you only had to wait
12 to 15 seconds.

10:05.964 --> 10:07.339
I think it was the right move.

10:07.422 --> 10:08.422
-Really?
-Yeah.

10:08.506 --> 10:09.756
It was inconsiderate.

10:09.839 --> 10:11.255
Is that your top speed
on this thing?

10:11.339 --> 10:13.130
-My top speed? Yes.
-Yeah.

10:13.214 --> 10:14.756
Did you hear footsteps
behind you?

10:14.839 --> 10:17.506
-I heard footsteps, and then,
whoosh, right past me.
-Okay.

10:17.589 --> 10:19.756
You should have moved over
to the right to let me pass.

10:19.839 --> 10:21.130
You should have given me
one of these.

10:21.214 --> 10:22.673
-You know?
-No, you've got to wait.

10:22.756 --> 10:24.714
You're blocking traffic.
You're in the slow car.

10:24.798 --> 10:26.381
You've gotta let
the fast cars through.

10:26.464 --> 10:28.464
No, you've gotta respect
the car in the front.

10:28.547 --> 10:30.756
I think you have
bad walker etiquette.
You're a hallway hog.

10:30.839 --> 10:33.214
-I didn't hog the hallway.
-I'll tell you what.

10:33.297 --> 10:35.464
Can I make it up to you?
Let me buy you a cup of coffee.

10:35.547 --> 10:36.798
Do you mean now
or sometime?

10:36.881 --> 10:38.089
Yeah, yeah. Sometime.

10:38.172 --> 10:40.422
I'd love that.
I'm Wally, by the way.

10:40.506 --> 10:41.756
-Wally, Larry.
-Larry.

10:41.839 --> 10:43.089
-Yeah.
-Good to meet you.

10:43.172 --> 10:44.798
Look, I've got nothing
against the handicapped.

10:44.881 --> 10:47.798
I've, I've dated
two women in, in wheelchairs.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.089
-Whoa. Two?
-Yeah.

10:49.172 --> 10:51.089
My disabled bona fides
are well-established.

10:51.172 --> 10:52.839
-Are you still
dating one of them?
-No, no.

10:52.923 --> 10:55.839
She caught me cheating
with the other...
with the other disabled woman.

10:55.923 --> 10:58.839
-Oof. (chuckles)
-Sure. Yeah, pretty good.

11:01.130 --> 11:03.214
So, Susie, I spoke
to the cardiologist,

11:03.297 --> 11:06.464
and I think you should consider
the idea of having him there.

11:06.547 --> 11:08.381
-Holzer?
-Yeah.

11:08.464 --> 11:10.130
He is so transparent.

11:10.214 --> 11:13.047
He's trying to finagle
an invitation to the party.

11:13.130 --> 11:15.005
You know what?
He's not getting one.

11:15.089 --> 11:17.589
We had two dinners
with him and his wife.

11:17.673 --> 11:20.089
Aggressively boring,
fuckin' brutal.

11:20.172 --> 11:22.214
Susie, why does it
have to be a surprise?

11:22.297 --> 11:24.923
Because I want it to be.

11:25.923 --> 11:29.089
(chopping loudly)

11:35.005 --> 11:39.255
(quick, rhythmic chopping)

11:45.005 --> 11:46.297
What?

11:46.673 --> 11:48.255
You're trying to kill him.

11:48.339 --> 11:50.089
-Trying to kill who?
-Jeff.

11:50.172 --> 11:51.339
You want to give him
a heart attack,

11:51.422 --> 11:53.172
and you want him to die
at that party.

11:53.255 --> 11:56.589
That's your plan, isn't it?
Huh? Isn't it?

11:56.673 --> 11:57.923
You're the most ridiculous

11:58.005 --> 11:59.214
-human being
I've ever encountered.
-Oh, am I?

11:59.297 --> 12:01.464
Anything happens to Jeff
at that party...

12:02.339 --> 12:04.798
I'm going to the cops.
What do you think of that?

12:04.881 --> 12:08.130
What are you gonna say?
"Oh, my friend's wife threw him
a surprise party.

12:08.214 --> 12:10.381
Here's the evidence.
It's an invitation."

12:10.464 --> 12:14.422
You ruin this surprise party,
I'm gonna fuck you up.

12:14.881 --> 12:17.964
(chopping loudly)

12:19.214 --> 12:21.089
Designer:
Building on basic ideas,

12:21.172 --> 12:24.589
I've come to these
three elements.

12:24.673 --> 12:26.923
You have your coffee cup,
of course.

12:27.005 --> 12:29.381
-Now here's where the magic is.
-Larry: Oh, wow.

12:29.464 --> 12:31.214
That is your
heating element, there.

12:31.297 --> 12:33.381
This is all going to be
one thing, of course.

12:33.464 --> 12:35.756
-And the heat comes from here.
-Heat comes from there.

12:35.839 --> 12:37.631
-This is mind-blow--
This is unbelievable.
-Yes.

12:37.714 --> 12:40.714
I'm excited about this project
because it means something
to me.

12:40.798 --> 12:42.506
Of course,
'cause you hate cold coffee.

12:42.589 --> 12:43.964
-I do.
-I mean,

12:44.047 --> 12:46.506
I'm so sick of taking
five, six, seven sips,

12:46.589 --> 12:48.089
and it's cold.

12:48.172 --> 12:50.756
It's as if coffee
is dictating to us

12:50.839 --> 12:53.255
when it must be consumed.

12:53.339 --> 12:55.047
I'm not okay with that.

12:55.130 --> 12:56.714
-Larry: I love that.
-(dog whines)

12:56.798 --> 12:59.714
-Heated cups.
-Oh, look who's up
from a nap.

12:59.798 --> 13:01.422
-Designer: Ah.
-(whines softly)

13:01.506 --> 13:03.297
Who's my (speaks German)?
Hmm?

13:03.381 --> 13:04.547
- Guter Hund!
-(kisses)

13:04.631 --> 13:06.381
This is my assistant, Adolf.

13:07.047 --> 13:09.756
You named your dog... Adolf?

13:09.839 --> 13:12.964
I named him after
my grandfather, my opa.

13:13.047 --> 13:15.172
He kind of looks
like him.

13:15.255 --> 13:17.756
He's got a handsome face,
but you can tell...

13:17.839 --> 13:19.089
he's stern.

13:19.172 --> 13:21.631
(chuckles)
You know what?
I have, uh...

13:21.714 --> 13:24.756
another drawing
I want to show you.
You're gonna love this.

13:27.464 --> 13:30.130
(growling)

13:30.214 --> 13:32.547
-(barking)
-Hey, hey.

13:32.631 --> 13:34.297
Hey.

13:34.381 --> 13:36.881
-(barking)
-Hey!

13:36.964 --> 13:38.130
Heil Hitler!

13:38.214 --> 13:39.881
(whimpers)

13:40.673 --> 13:41.673
(gasps)

13:41.756 --> 13:43.589
Hey!

13:43.673 --> 13:46.631
-Good boy. Yeah.
-(Adolf whining)

13:46.714 --> 13:48.673
Good boy.

13:49.255 --> 13:51.047
All right. I found it.

13:51.130 --> 13:53.381
Hey. What the hell's
with your dog?

13:53.464 --> 13:54.923
What?

13:55.005 --> 13:57.547
He was growling at me before,
like he was going to attack me,

13:57.631 --> 14:00.673
I was scared to death,
then I went " Heil Hitler  ,"

14:00.756 --> 14:03.255
and he suddenly walked over
and just lay down.

14:03.339 --> 14:06.464
-What? Why would you do that?
-Why would it work?

14:06.547 --> 14:09.673
Designer:
Did you put your arm out
like that

14:09.756 --> 14:11.923
-when you said it?
-Yeah, yeah. Like that.

14:12.005 --> 14:13.005
I know what that is.

14:13.089 --> 14:14.547
When I trained him,

14:14.631 --> 14:17.839
I would put a treat out
with my arm up, like that.

14:17.923 --> 14:19.089
Heel.

14:19.172 --> 14:21.714
(whining softly)

14:21.798 --> 14:23.297
See?

14:26.589 --> 14:29.339
Here's that, uh,
drawing I was looking for.

14:29.422 --> 14:32.255
As you can see,
these are different elements.

14:32.339 --> 14:34.297
(growling softly)

14:37.214 --> 14:38.839
Larry:
He's a white supremacist.

14:38.923 --> 14:40.506
He named his dog Adolf.

14:40.589 --> 14:42.214
He named his dog
after his grandfather.

14:42.297 --> 14:44.005
Hey, if my grandfather
was named Pol Pot,

14:44.089 --> 14:45.756
I wouldn't name my dog Pol Pot.

14:45.839 --> 14:47.881
Okay, I think he's more of
an eccentric than anything.

14:47.964 --> 14:50.547
-Eccentric?
-He's like an outdoors guy.

14:50.631 --> 14:53.255
He's part of
a tornado-chasing troop
called Stormfront.

14:53.339 --> 14:54.756
He had a great
shirt and hat.

14:54.839 --> 14:56.381
I fuckin' love
those TV shows

14:56.464 --> 14:58.297
where motherfuckin' white guys
get in a fuckin' van

14:58.381 --> 15:00.047
-and chase fuckin' tornadoes
and shit like that.
-This is this dude.

15:00.130 --> 15:01.714
-Yeah, yeah.
-No black guys in that van?

15:01.798 --> 15:03.714
No black man would ever
chase a fuckin' tornado.

15:03.798 --> 15:06.589
-Yeah. Why--
-That shit is dumb as fuck.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.005
Yeah, that,
that's so true.

15:08.089 --> 15:10.172
Right. But whatever
makes him weird like that

15:10.255 --> 15:11.673
also makes him great
at inventing.

15:11.756 --> 15:13.422
And that's what we're
talking about here, the cup.

15:13.506 --> 15:15.839
All right. Um...

15:15.923 --> 15:18.381
It's been sitting here
ten minutes. Time to test.

15:18.464 --> 15:20.381
Moment of truth.

15:20.464 --> 15:21.631
Hmm.

15:25.798 --> 15:28.255
I swear to you,
this is just as hot

15:28.339 --> 15:29.714
as it was ten minutes ago.

15:29.798 --> 15:31.589
-Freddy: That's tremendous.
-Just as hot.

15:31.673 --> 15:32.923
I mean, this is amazing.

15:33.005 --> 15:34.756
Well, you got Boris
to thank for it.

15:34.839 --> 15:36.756
Please, uh,
have him contact me.

15:36.839 --> 15:38.297
I got plenty of ideas and shit.

15:38.381 --> 15:40.089
-Really?
-Freddy: Give me one
off the top of your head.

15:40.172 --> 15:41.881
Okay. Uh, uh...

15:41.964 --> 15:43.506
-Pussy tea. Huh?
-Freddy: Mm-hmm.

15:43.589 --> 15:46.130
All the taste of pussy,
without the commitment.

15:46.214 --> 15:48.130
-Freddy: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
-Leon: Like, put that shit
in a tea bag.

15:48.214 --> 15:50.381
Well, I'll put you in contact
and see if anything flies
from it.

15:50.464 --> 15:52.756
-Please do.
-I can't make it to Jeff's
surprise party.

15:52.839 --> 15:56.214
-You guys going?
-Larry: I got big issues
with this surprise party.

15:56.297 --> 15:57.923
Jeff has a heart condition.

15:58.005 --> 15:59.673
-Oh.
-Susie knows that.

15:59.756 --> 16:01.673
-You're gonna think I'm crazy.
-Leon: Mm-hmm.

16:01.756 --> 16:05.881
I feel like Susie wants to give
this guy a heart attack

16:06.005 --> 16:09.297
with all these people
yelling, "Surprise."
She wants to kill him.

16:09.381 --> 16:11.547
You're saying the point
of the surprise party
is to kill him?

16:11.631 --> 16:13.464
-Yeah.
-Well, you're--
It is crazy.

16:13.547 --> 16:15.923
You don't think like a killer.
You don't have a devious mind.

16:16.005 --> 16:17.631
I do. I think like a killer.

16:17.714 --> 16:19.714
Because there are so many people
I want to kill.

16:19.798 --> 16:21.589
-Mm-hmm.
-And I'm telling you,

16:21.673 --> 16:24.297
she has bad intentions.

16:24.381 --> 16:26.506
Leon:
I love a good mystery.

16:26.589 --> 16:28.005
I was watching
Columbo  one night,

16:28.089 --> 16:29.297
at three in the morning.

16:29.381 --> 16:31.047
This motherfucker
had me convinced

16:31.130 --> 16:32.881
I did the shit.

16:34.923 --> 16:37.381
(sighs)
Man, you are in a tough spot.

16:37.464 --> 16:38.547
Yeah.

16:38.631 --> 16:40.506
Let's think it through.
If you tell him...

16:40.589 --> 16:41.839
She'll kill me.

16:41.923 --> 16:44.130
But then,
if you don't tell him...

16:44.214 --> 16:47.881
He could have
a heart attack and die.

16:47.964 --> 16:49.172
So what are you gonna do?

16:49.255 --> 16:51.255
Oh, I'm not gonna tell him.

16:51.339 --> 16:52.923
Then you'll have
to live with that.

16:53.005 --> 16:54.255
Eh.

16:54.923 --> 16:56.339
Hey, you wanna
play golf tomorrow?

16:56.422 --> 16:57.756
Uh, no, I can't.

16:57.839 --> 17:00.172
I have an appointment in
Beverly Hills at nine o'clock.

17:00.255 --> 17:02.339
Then I have another appointment
in Beverly Hills at eleven.

17:02.422 --> 17:03.631
I don't need the day planner.

17:03.714 --> 17:05.130
I'm trying to think
what I'm gonna do...

17:05.214 --> 17:06.714
-Oh, okay.
-...in between.

17:06.798 --> 17:08.547
I can't go home.

17:08.631 --> 17:11.089
Ah... (claps).
I got it.

17:14.923 --> 17:17.839
Oh. Hello.

17:17.923 --> 17:19.506
Larry:
Hello.

17:20.089 --> 17:22.422
Receptionist:
Do you have
an appointment?

17:22.506 --> 17:24.297
I don't have an appointment.

17:24.381 --> 17:26.547
Do you need to see the doctor?

17:26.631 --> 17:27.756
Uh-uh.

17:27.839 --> 17:29.631
Can I ask what you're doing?

17:29.714 --> 17:31.214
Larry:
I'm just between appointments.

17:31.297 --> 17:35.089
I needed somewhere to wait,
and this is a waiting room.

17:35.172 --> 17:37.422
You're just using
this waiting room...

17:37.506 --> 17:39.798
-To wait.
-Receptionist: That's not done.

17:39.881 --> 17:42.130
This is an establishment.
It's a, it's a business.

17:42.214 --> 17:44.798
And you know what?
My presence here

17:44.881 --> 17:46.255
is helping business.

17:46.339 --> 17:48.381
You go in a restaurant,
you see nobody in there,

17:48.464 --> 17:49.756
you don't think it's any good.

17:49.839 --> 17:51.422
When you see people there,
you think it's good.

17:51.506 --> 17:53.339
Same thing with
the doctor's office.

17:53.422 --> 17:56.130
Oh, it's, it's
the hitting thing?
You think I'm hitting?

17:56.214 --> 17:59.422
You've shown up
to my place of work,
unannounced,

17:59.506 --> 18:01.631
and now you're
just sitting there
staring at me.

18:01.714 --> 18:04.673
-It's not a hit.
-You know, it's starting to feel
more like stalking.

18:04.756 --> 18:08.214
You're living in this
paranoid world of hitting
and stalking, and...

18:08.297 --> 18:11.464
"Everybody wants me."
There's a certain kind
of conceit

18:11.547 --> 18:13.881
-attached to this,
if you don't mind me saying.
-(phone rings)

18:13.964 --> 18:17.047
-I'm just waiting.
That's it.
-Hey.

18:17.130 --> 18:19.422
-Hey.
-Dr. Holzer: Larry.

18:19.506 --> 18:20.881
-How you doing?
-Good, how are you?

18:20.964 --> 18:21.923
Good. Good.

18:22.005 --> 18:24.547
Hear, uh, uh,
any news on the party?

18:24.631 --> 18:26.756
I wish I had some
good news for you.

18:26.839 --> 18:28.255
Oh, no, no. It's, uh...
you know...

18:28.339 --> 18:30.422
I want you to go
to the party.

18:30.506 --> 18:33.422
-Susie nixed it.
-Nothing. All right.

18:33.506 --> 18:35.589
Do you think I want Jeff
walking in on...

18:35.673 --> 18:37.172
a big surprise like that?

18:37.255 --> 18:39.172
I'm a little concerned
about him, but, uh...

18:39.255 --> 18:41.130
-I don't have an invite.
-Hey, hey, hey.

18:41.214 --> 18:42.422
-What?
-How about this?

18:42.506 --> 18:44.756
I got it.
You call Jeff,

18:44.839 --> 18:48.547
you ask him out for dinner,
at Scopa,

18:48.631 --> 18:49.756
on the 20th.

18:49.839 --> 18:51.297
He'll go back,
he'll tell Susie.

18:51.381 --> 18:54.506
Susie will-- she'll text me.
She'll say no. She'll cancel.

18:54.589 --> 18:56.464
But you never got the text.

18:56.547 --> 18:57.881
No, I'd get the text.

18:57.964 --> 19:02.172
No.
You never got the text.

19:02.255 --> 19:04.798
So at the party,
Susie says,

19:04.881 --> 19:06.923
"I texted you and cancelled"
and I'd say,

19:07.005 --> 19:08.297
"I never got the text."

19:08.381 --> 19:09.631
Ta-da! Yes.

19:09.714 --> 19:12.881
No, I don't know.
Um, lying to Susie, that's--

19:12.964 --> 19:14.589
Susie scares me.

19:14.673 --> 19:17.839
Yeah, she scares everybody,
but you-you can't let her
run your life.

19:17.923 --> 19:19.798
She's very scary.
I'm scared of Susie.

19:19.881 --> 19:21.464
Are you serious?
Come on.

19:21.547 --> 19:23.297
-I don't know--
-Stop being such a wuss.

19:23.381 --> 19:25.798
-Rusty!
-I'll do it.

19:25.881 --> 19:27.964
-I'll do it.
-Proud of you.

19:28.047 --> 19:29.422
Call Jeff.

19:29.506 --> 19:31.464
-Thank you, Larry.
-Any time, Rusty.

19:31.547 --> 19:34.422
-Dr. Holzer: Never got it.
Never got the text.
-Doctor?

19:37.422 --> 19:38.506
Receptionist:
Well,

19:38.589 --> 19:40.339
I've got work to do.

19:40.422 --> 19:42.422
I've got waiting to do.

19:44.798 --> 19:46.589
(sighs)

19:47.923 --> 19:50.464
Larry:
You know, I've never had
a handicapped friend before.

19:50.547 --> 19:53.964
I'd like to have friends
of all creeds and disabilities.

19:54.047 --> 19:57.130
I mean, who's gonna get mad
at a guy like that?

19:57.214 --> 19:58.839
I have a friend
who's an amputee.

19:58.923 --> 20:02.631
An amputee friend?
Oh, I'd kill for
an amputee friend.

20:02.714 --> 20:04.381
(car honks)

20:04.464 --> 20:06.422
Wally, can you
speed this up a bit?
I mean,

20:06.506 --> 20:09.422
you drive as slow as you,
as you walk, with that walker.

20:09.506 --> 20:10.881
Oh, thank you.

20:10.964 --> 20:12.506
That's not a compliment.

20:12.589 --> 20:14.964
-(truck honks)
-Larry: Look at this.
That truck is passing you

20:15.047 --> 20:17.339
-on the right lane,
you're so slow.
-(cars honking)

20:17.422 --> 20:18.964
There's a whole--
All those horns,

20:19.047 --> 20:21.047
-they're beeping you.
-I don't think it's me.

20:21.130 --> 20:22.673
Well, who do you think
the honks are for?

20:22.756 --> 20:25.381
-Each other.
-I don't even know how
you ever got a license.

20:25.464 --> 20:28.089
Oh, it was pretty easy.
I mean, I studied up for it.

20:28.172 --> 20:29.714
And I went to the DMV,

20:29.798 --> 20:32.547
and I signed up, went home,

20:32.631 --> 20:34.422
waited for my appointment,
and then took--

20:34.506 --> 20:36.005
Yeah, I don't need
all the details of,

20:36.089 --> 20:38.047
-of that particular day
in your life.
-Took it--

20:38.130 --> 20:39.714
I'll spare you all the...

20:39.798 --> 20:41.714
-details, but I--
-Spare me. Spare me.

20:41.798 --> 20:42.964
Go ahead. Yeah.

20:43.047 --> 20:44.839
And I sat with
the instructor--

20:44.923 --> 20:47.798
Okay, you just said you
would spare me the details,
but you're not sparing.

20:47.881 --> 20:50.130
I'm skipping over
a lot of stuff.

20:50.214 --> 20:51.422
Oh, my God!

20:51.506 --> 20:53.047
S-Susie.

20:53.130 --> 20:54.547
Make, make a U-turn.
Make a U-turn.

20:54.631 --> 20:57.214
-I want you to follow
that woman.
-Sure.

20:57.297 --> 20:58.464
Larry:
Yeah.

20:58.547 --> 21:00.381
Wally:
Here we go.

21:00.464 --> 21:02.047
That lady right there?

21:02.130 --> 21:04.464
Larry: Yeah, she's right there
in that, that leopard coat.

21:04.547 --> 21:06.214
Only she would have
a coat like that.

21:06.297 --> 21:07.673
Wally:
Are we giving her a ride?

21:07.756 --> 21:09.005
No, no, no, no, no.

21:09.089 --> 21:11.089
Wally:
So, should I honk at her?

21:11.172 --> 21:13.589
Larry:
No, no, no.
Don't honk. Don't honk.

21:13.673 --> 21:15.089
What is she up to?

21:15.172 --> 21:17.798
What is she doing?
Westside Travel and Tour.

21:17.881 --> 21:19.756
Okay, we gotta find
a parking space nearby.

21:19.839 --> 21:21.714
Wally:
How about right in front?

21:21.798 --> 21:24.964
Larry: What are you doing?
You can't park here.
It's handicapped.

21:25.047 --> 21:27.339
Yes. Exactly.

21:27.422 --> 21:30.339
Oh, my God. Ho boy.

21:30.422 --> 21:31.464
Wow.

21:31.547 --> 21:32.756
You can park anywhere
with one of these.

21:32.839 --> 21:34.464
Larry: Oh.
Love to have one of those.

21:34.547 --> 21:35.923
Okay.
Here's what you're gonna do.

21:36.005 --> 21:37.297
You're gonna go
in that travel agency.

21:37.381 --> 21:38.798
-All right.
-You're gonna look at some

21:38.881 --> 21:40.464
pamphlets, brochures,
whatever.

21:40.547 --> 21:42.756
Meanwhile, the whole time,
you're eavesdropping

21:42.839 --> 21:44.005
on her conversation.

21:44.089 --> 21:46.297
-That lady?
-Everything she says,

21:46.381 --> 21:48.214
you report back to me.
Got it?

21:48.297 --> 21:50.798
And what's her name,
in case that comes up?

21:50.881 --> 21:53.297
Don't pay any attention to her!
You're eavesdropping!

21:53.381 --> 21:55.297
'Cause I wouldn't...
I wouldn't know

21:55.381 --> 21:57.047
her name, anyway.
She would be a stranger to me.

21:57.130 --> 21:58.839
Yes. Right!

21:58.923 --> 22:00.756
Right.

22:00.839 --> 22:02.005
Okay.

22:02.089 --> 22:03.422
Oi.

22:03.506 --> 22:05.255
You gonna need help
with that walker?

22:05.339 --> 22:06.547
Wally: No. I'm good.

22:07.047 --> 22:09.130
-Do you want
to come in with me?
-No, no!

22:09.214 --> 22:11.255
I can't come in with you.
She knows who I am.

22:11.339 --> 22:13.172
And don't come back
in the car.

22:13.255 --> 22:15.214
-I'm not gonna come back
in the car.
-You just came back.

22:15.297 --> 22:17.130
No, I'm going...

22:17.214 --> 22:19.005
-I'm going in--
-Okay, just go. Just go.

22:19.089 --> 22:21.756
-Okay. Back in a flash.
-Go. Hurry up.

22:24.923 --> 22:27.464
Larry:
This could be a matter
of life or death.

22:28.381 --> 22:29.798
Wally:
What?

22:37.464 --> 22:39.673
-(knocking)
-Larry: Hurry up.

22:39.756 --> 22:41.756
No, no, no. No, don't-

22:41.839 --> 22:44.673
Don't, don't, don't,
don't come back!
Don't come back!

22:44.756 --> 22:47.464
I want sun, I want sand.

22:47.547 --> 22:49.881
I want spa.

22:49.964 --> 22:51.631
-Travel agent: Okay.
-Spa facial.

22:51.714 --> 22:53.839
But nothing too remote,
'cause I'm a people person.

22:53.923 --> 22:56.172
-I like to socialize.
-Travel agent:
Islands are good?

22:56.255 --> 22:59.506
-Islands are great.
-All right. I'm thinking...

22:59.589 --> 23:01.255
-Bahamas?
-(gasps) I love the Bahamas!

23:01.339 --> 23:03.839
-Yeah?
-I've never been there.
I've always wanted to go.

23:03.923 --> 23:06.297
-Travel agent: The weather
is good all year in the Bahamas.
-Really.

23:06.381 --> 23:08.297
'Cause it fucking sucks here
right now. Look at this...

23:08.381 --> 23:11.047
weather, this rain,
it's so oppressive.

23:11.130 --> 23:12.798
Travel agent:
We can get you to
the Pink Sands Beach.

23:12.881 --> 23:15.381
-Ooh.
-We can fly you direct
into Nassau.

23:15.464 --> 23:18.756
Only hitch:
I need it rather quickly.

23:18.839 --> 23:21.798
-That's not a problem.
-This is perfect. Let's do it.
Bahamas.

23:21.881 --> 23:24.881
Bahamas!
Here I come, baby!

23:24.964 --> 23:26.547
I've been waiting
so long for this.

23:26.631 --> 23:30.172
-I can't wait to get
the fuck out of here.
-Aw. Girl.

23:30.255 --> 23:33.089
-Fascinating.
-Okay. What?
What happened?

23:33.172 --> 23:34.881
So I went in there.
I did a pretty good job

23:34.964 --> 23:36.964
-of sort of looking through
the brochures and everything.
-Yeah.

23:37.047 --> 23:40.214
-They had ones from Japan--
-I'm really not interested
in the brochures.

23:40.297 --> 23:41.881
What did she talk about?
What did she say?

23:41.964 --> 23:45.631
She was curious about...
the Bahamas.

23:45.714 --> 23:48.464
-The Bahamas?
-Yeah.

23:49.005 --> 23:50.923
Jeff hates the Caribbean.

23:51.005 --> 23:54.089
-When was she talking
about doing this?
-She said soon.

23:54.172 --> 23:55.339
Soon.

23:56.214 --> 23:59.339
Wally: And it was
something she was really
looking forward to.

24:04.673 --> 24:06.589
Larry:
There you go.

24:06.673 --> 24:08.047
Wally:
Thanks for lunch.

24:08.130 --> 24:09.673
Larry: I still can't
wrap my head around this...

24:09.756 --> 24:12.005
ticket to the Bahamas.
It's...

24:12.339 --> 24:14.089
-It's really crazy.
-Yeah.

24:14.172 --> 24:15.839
-All right. Well,
let's do it again sometime.
-Yes.

24:15.923 --> 24:17.964
Great to see you.
I'm out of town.

24:18.047 --> 24:20.255
I get back on the 20th.

24:20.339 --> 24:23.172
But as soon as I'm back,
let's go get a meal.

24:23.673 --> 24:25.589
Hey, I don't suppose...

24:25.673 --> 24:28.297
you would mind lending me
your handicapped placard.

24:28.381 --> 24:30.172
Would that be possible?

24:30.255 --> 24:31.881
That is assigned to me.

24:31.964 --> 24:34.631
-No, of course. I understand.
-So that's...
I had to apply for it.

24:34.714 --> 24:37.339
-Because of my feet
and my leg, and...
-Obviously. Obviously.

24:37.422 --> 24:40.339
-Yeah.
-...and the alignment
in my spine, so...

24:40.422 --> 24:42.130
I'll take very good
care of it.

24:42.214 --> 24:44.130
Well, I've never lent it
to anyone before,

24:44.214 --> 24:46.422
but let me just explain
to you what it is.
This goes in your car.

24:46.506 --> 24:48.923
-You don't take it down.
It just stays up on the mirror.
-Right. Stays up on the mirror.

24:49.005 --> 24:51.089
-Got it. Yeah. Right.
-Yeah. There's no lock.

24:51.172 --> 24:54.798
And you'll see that there's
a person in a wheelchair.
That's not me.

24:54.881 --> 24:56.964
I didn't think
it was you, Wally.

24:57.047 --> 24:58.631
The number is G921...

24:58.714 --> 25:00.631
-BR7--
-Yeah, you don't have to
read the number. I see it.

25:00.714 --> 25:04.089
-But if they ask you.
-If they ask me, yeah,
I'll read it out there. Yeah.

25:04.172 --> 25:06.089
-G-9-2-1-B-R-7-9.
-Okay.

25:06.172 --> 25:07.714
I think we're good.
I think I got it.

25:10.297 --> 25:12.172
-All right.
-Thank you.

25:12.255 --> 25:13.881
-I'll see you
when you get back.
-Okay.

25:18.714 --> 25:20.172
Leon!

25:20.255 --> 25:22.839
Leon, where are you?

25:22.923 --> 25:24.089
I got it!

25:24.172 --> 25:25.923
-I got it!
-Hey, I'm back here.

25:26.005 --> 25:27.464
Look what I got!

25:27.547 --> 25:29.464
-Leon: Woo, what the fuck?
-I'm gonna go change.

25:29.547 --> 25:31.673
-We're gonna have some fun.
-You're goddamned right, we are.

25:31.756 --> 25:35.089
Hit the fuckin' lottery.
The fuckin' handicapped
lottery, Larry.

25:36.255 --> 25:38.839
-Leon: Woo! Whoa!
-Larry: Here we go.

25:38.923 --> 25:40.381
We got the placard.
Let's use it.

25:40.464 --> 25:42.464
Leon: The sky's
the motherfuckin' limit.
(chuckles)

25:44.089 --> 25:45.964
Oh, no. No. No.

25:46.047 --> 25:47.631
You're not gonna do this
a second time.

25:47.714 --> 25:50.005
-Leon: Is that a hobbit?
-Jane: No way!

25:50.756 --> 25:52.881
Aah, to hell with you.

25:52.964 --> 25:54.422
(laughs)

25:56.756 --> 25:57.881
Oh, shit.

25:57.964 --> 26:00.464
Throw that shit on.
(clears throat loudly)

26:00.547 --> 26:02.881
Excuse me.
Got a placard, there.

26:02.964 --> 26:05.422
Ah! I am so sorry, sir.
Okay?

26:05.506 --> 26:08.631
-Larry: Yeah.
-No problem.
Have a great day.

26:09.881 --> 26:12.339
You know what?
I just might take
a lead pipe to your leg

26:12.422 --> 26:13.923
so we can get one of these
all the time.

26:14.005 --> 26:15.673
-(Leon laughs)
-What's next?

26:15.756 --> 26:17.714
Leon:
This arcade is doing
big business.

26:17.798 --> 26:21.798
Larry: What is this?
Oh, yeah. I know.
Oh, see?

26:21.881 --> 26:23.172
Thank you.

26:23.255 --> 26:25.214
-Leon: Yeah!
-(Larry laughs)

26:25.297 --> 26:27.422
Larry:
This thing. Wow.

26:27.506 --> 26:29.547
-Turn, turn, Larry!
We gotta turn!
-Larry: I am turning!

26:29.631 --> 26:31.422
(both yelling)

26:31.506 --> 26:32.839
(grunts)

26:32.923 --> 26:34.339
Leon:
Ooh!

26:35.381 --> 26:37.673
(sighs) We got 287 tickets.

26:37.756 --> 26:39.839
Let me get that
Wiffle ball, bat right there.

26:39.923 --> 26:43.589
For my man, right there.
Yeah, he gon' love that shit.

26:43.673 --> 26:45.756
-That's for you.
-Ah!

26:45.839 --> 26:47.422
-Yeah.
-Matzo scented.

26:47.506 --> 26:48.881
See that?

26:49.714 --> 26:52.047
-Leon: Yeah.
-All right.

26:52.130 --> 26:53.798
Ha, ha, ha.

26:53.881 --> 26:55.047
(Susie humming)

26:55.130 --> 26:56.339
Where are you going?

26:56.422 --> 26:58.631
-Uh, hitting some balls
at the range.
-Uh-huh.

26:58.714 --> 27:02.047
Listen, I, uh, made, uh,
dinner plans with Dr. Holzer.

27:02.130 --> 27:03.589
-When?
-For the, uh, 20th.

27:03.673 --> 27:05.964
No. Absolutely not. Cancel.

27:06.047 --> 27:08.673
-But...
-Cancel.

27:14.714 --> 27:17.881
-Larry: Hey, Look who's there!
-That's that racist
motherfucker?

27:17.964 --> 27:19.881
Yeah, and he's got
the cups!

27:20.464 --> 27:21.798
We're in business.

27:21.881 --> 27:24.339
-(barking)
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:24.923 --> 27:26.798
Boris:
Whoa. Hey, hey.

27:26.881 --> 27:29.214
(growling)

27:29.297 --> 27:31.047
-(snarls)
-Heil Hitler!

27:31.130 --> 27:32.839
(whimpers)

27:32.923 --> 27:36.047
Yes, that's a good boy.

27:36.130 --> 27:39.673
Who's a good Adolf?
Ooh!

27:44.839 --> 27:47.923
-Larry: Wow. All these?
-Mm-hmm.

27:48.005 --> 27:49.381
-So fast.
-I know.

27:49.464 --> 27:51.756
-That was amazing.
-They're done.

27:51.839 --> 27:54.631
I looked at a spectrum
of colors, but I decided
to go with white.

27:54.714 --> 27:56.130
It's the best.

27:56.214 --> 27:58.005
Good choice.
I like this.

27:58.089 --> 27:59.464
This is smart. You know?

27:59.547 --> 28:01.297
And I just made it smarter.

28:01.381 --> 28:03.673
By giving it a power saucer.

28:03.756 --> 28:07.172
-Wow.
-And this is where you get
the juice for the battery.

28:07.255 --> 28:08.506
This is so impressive.

28:08.589 --> 28:12.547
Finally, a solution
to cold coffee.

28:13.839 --> 28:15.047
Yeah.

28:16.798 --> 28:18.923
(growls)

28:20.631 --> 28:23.130
(growls, barks)

28:23.214 --> 28:25.547
-Larry: Hey, hey!
-Nein!  Halt! Adolf, halt!

28:25.631 --> 28:27.005
-Nein!
-(Adolf growling)

28:27.089 --> 28:28.881
-Larry: Adolf!
-Boris: Nein!  Halt!

28:28.964 --> 28:30.923
(shouting):
Guter Hund! Nein!

28:32.047 --> 28:34.255
Adolf!
(speaks German)

28:38.756 --> 28:41.381
-Was this important?
-(Adolf barks)

28:41.464 --> 28:43.506
(knocking)

28:45.464 --> 28:47.297
-Larry: Hey.
-Hey, I'm back.

28:47.381 --> 28:48.214
Yeah!

28:48.297 --> 28:50.589
Had a good trip,
a lot of fun.

28:50.673 --> 28:52.089
Great. Great.

28:52.172 --> 28:53.923
The placard.

28:55.297 --> 28:57.047
-Ah.
-I need it.

28:57.130 --> 28:58.756
Yeah. Yeah.

28:58.839 --> 29:02.130
A little problem
with the placard.

29:02.547 --> 29:04.214
The dog ate it.

29:04.297 --> 29:06.047
What dog?

29:06.130 --> 29:07.381
Adolf?

29:07.464 --> 29:09.381
Adolf. So this is
the best excuse

29:09.464 --> 29:12.005
-you can come up with?
-I'm telling you the truth.

29:12.089 --> 29:14.631
That's what Adolf
wanted to eat is... plastic?

29:14.714 --> 29:16.547
Well, he wanted to eat
the Star of David,

29:16.631 --> 29:18.464
which was right
in front of the placard.

29:18.547 --> 29:22.005
The placard was
collateral damage.

29:22.506 --> 29:24.923
-Sorry.
-Are you stealing it?
I need it...

29:25.005 --> 29:27.089
-No, I'm not stealing it.
I'm telling you the truth.
-...to park.

29:27.172 --> 29:30.005
You want to see it?
You want to see what
I'm talking about?

29:31.214 --> 29:32.798
(sighs)

29:32.881 --> 29:34.964
There was a lot more to it,
but it all crumpled

29:35.047 --> 29:36.506
and fell apart, and--

29:36.589 --> 29:38.798
I really need that to park.

29:38.881 --> 29:41.422
-Let me buy you a new one.
-If you don't mind, yes.

29:41.506 --> 29:42.923
No, I don't mind at all.

29:43.005 --> 29:45.506
-Go down to the DMV.
-Yeah.

29:45.589 --> 29:48.506
-And say it got misplaced.
-I, I know what to say.

29:48.589 --> 29:50.756
The number is G92--

29:50.839 --> 29:52.506
-Just, just text it to me.
-Okay.

29:52.589 --> 29:54.923
-I will text you
the number. G92--
-Okay.

29:55.005 --> 29:57.464
Well, if you're going
to text it to me, there's
no reason to repeat it,

29:57.547 --> 29:59.255
-'cause I'm not going
to remember it.
-Okay.

29:59.339 --> 30:02.172
So once you fill that out,
they'll give you
a temporary pass.

30:02.255 --> 30:03.839
-Okay. Here you go.
-But the number
will be different

30:03.923 --> 30:06.089
-'cause it'll be a "T"
for temporary.
-Right, temporary.

30:06.172 --> 30:08.422
-So, it's T921--
-Okay. Don't worry about it.

30:08.506 --> 30:10.172
I'll get the placard.
As soon as I get it,

30:10.255 --> 30:11.964
I'll go to your house
and give you the placard.

30:12.047 --> 30:13.881
There's no more
to be said about it.
Here you go.

30:13.964 --> 30:17.047
-Okay. Great. All right.
-All right. Sorry, again.

30:26.381 --> 30:28.297
Why are you going
in a circle?

30:28.381 --> 30:30.714
You could have just
walked backwards.

30:31.714 --> 30:33.923
Easier to go down stairs
this way.

30:35.297 --> 30:36.464
It's easy.

30:36.547 --> 30:38.005
Quick. Ah.

30:38.089 --> 30:40.047
And we're down.

30:42.255 --> 30:44.214
Can't find my cell phone.

30:44.297 --> 30:46.172
-Really?
-Yeah.

30:46.255 --> 30:48.631
Huh. Did you ask Susie?

30:48.714 --> 30:50.172
She don't know
where it is.

30:50.255 --> 30:51.923
All right. You're up.

30:52.005 --> 30:53.381
You know what?

30:53.464 --> 30:55.255
You, you go first.

30:55.339 --> 30:57.714
-Wha-- What's with you?
-Out of breath.

30:57.798 --> 30:59.839
-Out of breath?
-Yeah.

30:59.923 --> 31:01.464
Five steps.

31:01.547 --> 31:03.589
Just telling you,
I'm out of breath.

31:03.673 --> 31:05.339
(sighs)

31:05.756 --> 31:07.881
How've things been
with you and Susie?

31:07.964 --> 31:10.214
She's been great.
Out of nowhere.

31:10.297 --> 31:11.839
But I'm gonna go with it.

31:12.339 --> 31:14.005
She even asked me
out to dinner tonight.

31:14.089 --> 31:18.089
-I'm meeting her at Scopa.
-Hmm. Really?

31:18.172 --> 31:19.214
Uh-huh.

31:19.297 --> 31:22.547
Jeff (panting):
She's been a doll.

31:22.631 --> 31:26.214
When have I ever said that
about Susie?

31:26.297 --> 31:28.881
-Larry: Hey, Wally, it's Larry.
-Wally (over phone):
Hey. How's it going?

31:28.964 --> 31:32.047
I need you to do me a big favor.
Remember that woman
we were following?

31:32.130 --> 31:33.464
Uh, yes.

31:33.547 --> 31:35.506
Larry (over phone):
Well, she's giving
a surprise party

31:35.589 --> 31:38.506
for her husband tonight
at Scopa at 7:20.

31:38.589 --> 31:41.547
I need you to wait
in front of the restaurant,
and when he walks up,

31:41.631 --> 31:44.381
tell him that there's
a surprise party inside for him.

31:44.464 --> 31:46.297
Why do you want me to ruin
a surprise?

31:46.381 --> 31:47.714
Larry:
Because he has
a heart condition.

31:47.798 --> 31:49.422
And this could be a matter
of life and death.

31:49.506 --> 31:50.839
Why can't I just call him?

31:50.923 --> 31:52.756
Because he has no cell phone.
He lost it.

31:52.839 --> 31:55.130
I don't know if I have
the right clothes for it.
Should I wear a, a jack--?

31:55.214 --> 31:56.839
Larry:
It doesn't matter.
You're not going to the party.

31:56.923 --> 31:59.089
You're just waiting outside
and telling him about it.

31:59.172 --> 32:00.547
What does this person
look like?

32:00.631 --> 32:02.881
I'm gonna send you a picture
and all the information.

32:02.964 --> 32:04.714
Everything you need to know.
I'll text you.

32:04.798 --> 32:06.422
Okay, and you have
my number, right?

32:06.506 --> 32:09.422
Of course I have your number!
How else could I have called?

32:09.506 --> 32:11.756
What's wrong? Buddy.

32:11.839 --> 32:14.255
Susie:
Okay, he's gonna be here soon.

32:14.339 --> 32:16.714
Everybody, lots of noise.
Lots of noise.

32:16.798 --> 32:19.130
Hi. Here you go. Noise.

32:19.214 --> 32:21.714
Big, loud booming noise.

32:21.798 --> 32:23.964
-Lar.
-Big, loud, booming noise.

32:24.047 --> 32:25.547
-Yeah.
-That's what you want,
don't you?

32:25.631 --> 32:27.255
The louder, the better.

32:27.339 --> 32:28.464
I don't know
what you're thinking,

32:28.547 --> 32:29.756
-but you're delusional.
-Larry: Yeah.

32:29.839 --> 32:31.339
-Leon, so nice to see you.
-Yeah.

32:31.422 --> 32:33.464
Thank you for coming.
He'll be here soon.
Lots of noise.

32:33.547 --> 32:35.589
-Lots of noise.
-Fuckin' see what
you're talking about, now.

32:35.673 --> 32:37.714
-You see it, right?
-Oh, fuck yeah, I see it.

32:37.798 --> 32:40.381
-That's some shit.
-But guess what?

32:40.464 --> 32:42.547
-Mm-hmm.
-It's not gonna happen.

32:42.631 --> 32:44.506
I got a guy outside.

32:44.589 --> 32:46.798
-Mm.
-Who's gonna tell Jeff

32:46.881 --> 32:49.005
it's a surprise.

32:55.214 --> 32:57.631
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing?
-(knocks)

32:57.714 --> 32:59.339
Hey, you can't park here.
It's handicapped.

32:59.422 --> 33:02.464
-Sir, I have a walker.
I can park here.
-Where's your placard?

33:02.547 --> 33:04.631
I usually have one.
It's just,

33:04.714 --> 33:06.547
-a friend of mine
borrowed it, and--
-No, no, no.

33:06.631 --> 33:08.464
If you don't have one now,
you can't park here.

33:08.547 --> 33:11.589
-Come on. Now. Let's go.
-(Wally stammering)

33:11.673 --> 33:13.547
Come on.

33:15.673 --> 33:16.923
Hey, Chris.

33:17.005 --> 33:18.714
-How you doing?
-Hey, hey. How are you?

33:18.798 --> 33:20.631
-Larry.
-Hey, Larry. Larry.
That's right. Jeff's friend.

33:20.714 --> 33:22.255
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Yeah.

33:22.339 --> 33:24.714
-You playing tonight?
-Yeah, I'm gonna
sing some songs.

33:24.798 --> 33:26.172
-Really?
-Yeah.

33:26.255 --> 33:27.422
Want to sing one with me?

33:27.506 --> 33:30.005
I'll probably leave
before you get on.

33:30.089 --> 33:31.964
I mean, people pay
a lot of money
to see us.

33:32.047 --> 33:35.005
Yeah, I know. I don't like
to stay around too long
for stuff like that.

33:35.089 --> 33:36.714
I'm not gonna be able
to look at everybody

33:36.798 --> 33:38.381
just looking at you like this
and clapping and singing along.

33:38.464 --> 33:40.506
-You don't wanna--
-It's gonna be disgusting.

33:40.589 --> 33:42.631
-You know?
-I think it's just respect.

33:42.714 --> 33:44.381
(stammers):
Maybe I'll stay.

33:44.464 --> 33:47.089
-Well, I'd prefer
you didn't right now.
-Yeah? (laughs)

33:47.172 --> 33:48.214
Yeah.

33:48.297 --> 33:50.047
Wally:
Are you leaving?

33:50.964 --> 33:52.339
Nobody's leaving.

33:52.422 --> 33:55.172
Oh, there's nothing.
There's gotta be something.

33:55.255 --> 33:57.506
No parking anytime.

33:57.589 --> 33:59.214
There's nowhere to park!

33:59.297 --> 34:01.255
Let me ask you a question.
You're in your car.

34:01.339 --> 34:03.547
One of your songs comes on.
What do you do?

34:03.631 --> 34:05.172
-I pull over.
-(laughs)

34:05.255 --> 34:06.881
-You pull over?
-Yeah.

34:06.964 --> 34:08.172
-And you listen?
-Yeah.

34:08.255 --> 34:10.005
-You sing in the shower?
-If I have company,

34:10.089 --> 34:11.464
I'll sing in the shower, yeah.

34:11.547 --> 34:13.547
Why would you want to shower
with another person?

34:13.631 --> 34:16.047
The scents, and the aromas,
and the--

34:16.130 --> 34:18.214
