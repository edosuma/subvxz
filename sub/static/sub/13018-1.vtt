02:45.880 --> 02:47.199
Thank you, sir. Next.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.839
Good day, chap. Wallace Ritchie.

02:49.840 --> 02:51.371
Passport, please.

02:52.160 --> 02:54.999
Just flown over from America.
I'm an American.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.885
It's a new passport. It's
not a very good picture.

02:58.080 --> 03:01.523
- I have a better picture.
- That won't be necessary, sir.

03:01.720 --> 03:04.048
You've got a great accent.
Are you from here?

03:04.640 --> 03:07.839
What is the purpose of your
visit to this country, sir?

03:07.840 --> 03:09.849
Today is my birthday.

03:10.520 --> 03:12.245
Happy birthday, sir.

03:13.240 --> 03:14.439
Thank you.

03:14.440 --> 03:18.839
My brother sent me money this year, so
I thought I'd come over and surprise him.

03:18.840 --> 03:22.681
He works in the Featherstone
Finch bank. James Ritchie.

03:24.400 --> 03:25.601
Do you know him?

03:25.640 --> 03:27.359
<i>Good evening.</i>

03:30.080 --> 03:31.959
<i>Pleased to meet you.</i>

03:37.760 --> 03:39.325
<i>Very good.</i>

03:40.000 --> 03:41.159
Yah!

03:41.160 --> 03:43.879
How long will you be
staying in this country?

03:43.880 --> 03:45.889
That's a very good question.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.839
Yes, I thought so too.

03:47.840 --> 03:52.967
I'd like to see everything but not have
people know I'm a tourist, you know?

03:53.000 --> 03:54.719
Featherstone Finch believes that...

03:54.720 --> 03:59.608
one of our major strengths, if not
our major strength, is our diversity...

04:00.320 --> 04:01.599
ls our diversification.

04:01.600 --> 04:05.279
I want to see where the blitz was.
I've seen the film and it's incredible.

04:05.280 --> 04:08.359
- Half a day.
- I want to try that meat pudding.

04:08.360 --> 04:10.919
I want to take a double-decker bus.

04:10.920 --> 04:13.239
Uh, half a day.
Good night, Garrett.

04:13.240 --> 04:16.599
I want to see the queen riding a
horse. I want to get a suit made.

04:16.600 --> 04:18.279
Okay. Three weeks.

04:18.279 --> 04:20.289
Welcome to Great
Britain, Mr. Ritchie.

04:20.440 --> 04:22.559
Thanks very much. And it's Wallace.

04:22.560 --> 04:23.921
David.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.921
- Which door is England?
- That one there.

04:27.160 --> 04:28.759
Stupid cow.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.319
Stupid cow.

04:30.320 --> 04:32.759
Stand by. The client's in position.

04:32.760 --> 04:37.439
Okay, look. He's nervous. He's nervous,
so I want plenty of energy, please.

04:37.440 --> 04:38.999
Be generous.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.010
- Stand by the phone, Des.
- Ahem.

04:42.960 --> 04:44.959
And dial.

04:46.200 --> 04:48.767
And curtain up.

04:55.320 --> 04:58.439
- You stupid cow!
- Please, mister, you've got to help me!

04:58.440 --> 05:00.399
- Give me the phone!
- Leave me alone!

05:00.400 --> 05:03.410
I'm on the phone across the street!
You can see me in the window!

05:03.440 --> 05:05.959
- You've got to help me!
- Who are you on the phone to?

05:05.960 --> 05:07.679
None of your business.

05:07.680 --> 05:09.450
Who are you talking to?

05:10.560 --> 05:13.199
Look who it is. It's
your favorite john.

05:13.200 --> 05:15.880
Go on. Tell him he can't
talk to you like that.

05:16.080 --> 05:18.009
- Come on, come on.
- Um...

05:18.480 --> 05:20.519
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

05:20.520 --> 05:24.122
- Tell him to piss off.
- Look, this has gone quite far enough.

05:25.280 --> 05:27.482
- And?
- The way you're treating...

05:28.000 --> 05:30.079
- Des.
- Des...

05:30.080 --> 05:31.799
What do you know about it?

05:31.800 --> 05:34.039
It isn't the way a
man should behave...

05:34.040 --> 05:35.605
Otto.

05:35.920 --> 05:37.770
What I'm saying is...

05:37.800 --> 05:39.923
- I don't like him!
- Don't push your luck!

05:41.080 --> 05:44.039
He's got a black belt.
Haven't you? Go on, tell him.

05:44.040 --> 05:47.719
Yes. I've got a black
belt in karate.

05:47.720 --> 05:50.319
Oh yeah? Karate chop this, then!

05:50.320 --> 05:52.639
- What're you going to do now?
- Put the gun away!

05:52.640 --> 05:54.001
Put the gun down!

05:54.080 --> 05:58.410
- Put it down or we'll have to take you in!
- Who called the police? Was it you?

05:58.960 --> 06:02.130
- No. No, no, no.
- Put the gun down!

06:02.200 --> 06:03.640
Want to take me?

06:03.960 --> 06:07.004
Do you? Stay there. You're
going to have to catch me!

06:07.600 --> 06:08.961
Otto!

06:09.840 --> 06:11.087
Come on!

06:11.800 --> 06:16.159
Second police unit. They just left the
building and are heading towards you.

06:16.160 --> 06:20.490
I will follow at a discreet distance.
Stand by, man with dog.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.359
<i>Wow. Exciting stuff.</i>

06:23.360 --> 06:24.599
<i>Tickets aren't cheap...</i>

06:24.600 --> 06:28.799
<i>but neither are the thrills in London's
interactive theater experience:</i>

06:28.800 --> 06:30.319
<i>The Theater of Life.</i>

06:30.320 --> 06:32.159
<i>There are real streets, real rooms.</i>

06:32.160 --> 06:35.679
<i>If you've got a sense of adventure,
you can be a real star for a night.</i>

06:35.680 --> 06:37.325
<i>You don't have to learn lines.</i>

06:37.360 --> 06:40.325
<i>With help from your fellow
actors, you improvise as you go.</i>

06:40.600 --> 06:42.399
Our major strength
is diversification.

06:43.560 --> 06:45.199
My God, that can't be them.

06:45.200 --> 06:47.839
Consuela, the door, the door.

06:47.840 --> 06:50.119
- I ordered some more champagne.
- I better go.

06:50.120 --> 06:52.479
Our major strength is diversity.

06:52.480 --> 06:55.604
Our major strength
is diversification.

06:55.920 --> 06:57.849
We've got our fingers in many pies.

06:59.600 --> 07:02.399
Sis. Let's have a hug.

07:03.720 --> 07:05.559
Whoa! Look at you.

07:05.560 --> 07:09.159
You're a sweet little
pocket-rocket. What fun!

07:09.160 --> 07:11.647
I thought he had an
uptight English gal.

07:11.880 --> 07:14.321
I'm Mrs. Ritchie. Can I help you?

07:15.200 --> 07:16.399
You're Barbara?

07:16.400 --> 07:19.251
I'm Mrs. Ritchie and
this is our maid.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.239
Is that champagne?

07:21.240 --> 07:24.079
No, it's some shirts and socks
and a few pairs of jeans.

07:24.080 --> 07:25.399
Oh, my God!

07:25.400 --> 07:26.959
- I know this guy.
- Oh, whoa.

07:28.120 --> 07:31.039
- Wally. Ha-ha-ha.
- Hey.

07:31.040 --> 07:32.879
Look at you!

07:32.880 --> 07:35.799
Look at you. You're still the
ugly brother, thank God.

07:35.800 --> 07:37.599
Barbara, this is my
brother, Wallace.

07:37.600 --> 07:40.079
- Hello. Pleased to meet you.
- Sorry to scare you.

07:40.080 --> 07:41.479
What're you doing here?

07:41.480 --> 07:44.039
Today's my birthday. I thought
you might not remember...

07:44.040 --> 07:46.039
so I came over to get
my presents here.

07:46.040 --> 07:48.919
How lovely. Set another
place for dinner.

07:48.920 --> 07:50.439
Great idea.

07:50.440 --> 07:52.642
No, no, bad idea.

07:52.880 --> 07:54.519
Wally can't be here tonight.

07:54.520 --> 07:56.119
Why? He seems very sweet.

07:56.120 --> 07:57.559
He is sweet.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.559
Yeah, but...?

07:59.560 --> 08:04.279
He's not the kind of guy you drop
into a boring business dinner.

08:04.280 --> 08:06.279
With Wally, you need
a sense of humor.

08:06.280 --> 08:08.958
- And we have Germans coming for dinner.
- Exactly.

08:08.959 --> 08:12.439
Still, they might find him interesting,
being in the film industry.

08:12.440 --> 08:14.439
Oh.

08:14.440 --> 08:16.799
It's not exactly the film industry.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.684
It is and it isn't. It is.

08:19.160 --> 08:21.124
I'm with Blockbuster in Des Moines.

08:22.240 --> 08:23.919
So you're not a producer.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.239
Not exactly.

08:25.240 --> 08:27.199
- Not at all, really.
- No way.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.479
- It's just something I say.
- We all say it.

08:29.480 --> 08:31.639
- It's something I say.
- A joke.

08:33.360 --> 08:35.999
Right, then. We'll just get
rid of you for the night.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.719
No, we won't. Not tonight.
It's his birthday.

08:38.720 --> 08:40.524
- Oh.
- Ha, ha.

08:40.919 --> 08:42.558
Get rid of him how?

08:42.559 --> 08:44.250
What would he like?

08:44.960 --> 08:46.719
Drama or a musical?

08:46.720 --> 08:49.239
He likes it all.
He wanted to be an actor.

08:49.240 --> 08:53.809
He got the lead in our high school
play, but on opening night he...

08:53.960 --> 08:58.159
I never thought anybody could forget so
much so fast without a blow to the head.

08:58.160 --> 09:00.119
Damn, then this won't work.

09:00.120 --> 09:02.439
<i>Theater of Life</i>. It's on TV now.

09:02.440 --> 09:05.039
One of those
audience-participation things.

09:05.040 --> 09:06.919
No, that sounds
really embarrassing.

09:06.920 --> 09:09.851
Pity. It's three and
a half hours long.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.559
It sounds really embarrassing.

09:16.560 --> 09:20.519
This is London. This is theater land.
This is the hottest ticket in town.

09:20.520 --> 09:22.927
I won't have to go
on stage, will I?

09:23.160 --> 09:26.479
They call you, tell you who you are,
where to go and help make up the rest.

09:26.480 --> 09:29.445
There's nothing even to
forget. Can I see the hat?

09:33.000 --> 09:34.486
- No?
- No.

09:35.320 --> 09:38.364
I wish we could hang out.
It's my birthday.

09:39.280 --> 09:40.599
I tell you what.

09:40.600 --> 09:44.359
I was saving these for the
dinner party. Ambassadors.

09:44.360 --> 09:48.839
The finest smokes you can buy. You and
I will fire them up when you get back.

09:48.840 --> 09:50.119
Havana.

09:50.120 --> 09:52.159
- Birthday cigars.
- That's them.

09:52.160 --> 09:53.399
It's early.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.399
I already laid out
117 pounds and 50.

09:56.960 --> 09:59.731
- What's that in real money?
- Pick up the phone.

10:00.160 --> 10:01.407
Spenser.

10:01.920 --> 10:03.159
They want Spenser.

10:03.160 --> 10:06.967
That's your character name. Go
on, say something back. Go on.

10:07.360 --> 10:10.643
- Hello.
<i>- Number 6 Bishops Mews.</i>

10:12.400 --> 10:15.649
<i>The back door is open.
The girl is upstairs.</i>

10:16.560 --> 10:19.764
<i>Radio contact only from now on.</i>

10:20.720 --> 10:22.570
<i>And Spenser, this time...</i>

10:22.800 --> 10:26.129
remember to flush. Out.

10:28.840 --> 10:30.565
What'd they say?

10:30.720 --> 10:32.359
Remember to flush.

10:32.360 --> 10:34.359
They were supposed to
give you an address.

10:34.360 --> 10:36.130
6 Bishops Mews, England.

10:36.520 --> 10:41.248
That's right around the corner. Come on.
I'll drop you off. It's gonna be great.

10:57.200 --> 10:58.519
Speak.

10:58.520 --> 11:02.079
<i>- Help me! He's going to kill me!
- Give me that phone!</i>

11:02.080 --> 11:04.519
- Who is this?
<i>- I'm in the flat across the street!</i>

11:04.520 --> 11:08.167
<i>You can see me in the
window! Help me, please!</i>

11:10.800 --> 11:13.879
Liar! You stupid cow!

11:13.880 --> 11:16.479
You lay one finger on me
and I'm calling the police.

11:16.480 --> 11:19.159
Call the police now, then! Go on!

11:19.160 --> 11:22.639
Ah. Bang on cue,
your favorite john.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.923
Johnny, tell him he can't
talk to you like that.

11:26.160 --> 11:28.010
Tell him to go to hell.

11:29.640 --> 11:31.729
Tell him anything you want.

11:32.240 --> 11:35.079
Yeah, tell me anything
you want! Come on!

11:35.080 --> 11:39.285
Do you know what your problem is, apart
from being a really ugly bastard?

11:39.400 --> 11:42.126
Come on! You big pansy!

11:43.000 --> 11:45.441
Give us your best shot, mouseballs!

11:53.000 --> 11:54.804
Excuse me, are...?

11:55.160 --> 11:56.361
Wally.

11:56.520 --> 11:58.290
Hello.

11:58.400 --> 12:01.331
Why have we stopped,
people? Is there a problem?

12:01.560 --> 12:03.639
- Break a leg. Gotta go.
- Okay, later.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.199
All right. Have fun.

12:05.200 --> 12:07.679
Wait. What am I supposed
to do when this is over?

12:07.680 --> 12:10.079
- I have no idea where I am.
- Take my phone.

12:10.080 --> 12:13.319
When the show's over, around
11:30, no hurry, call me.

12:13.320 --> 12:16.639
I'll pick you up and we'll smoke
those Ambassadors by midnight.

12:16.640 --> 12:19.571
- Gotta be my birthday so 11:59, the latest.
- 11:59.

12:20.120 --> 12:23.608
- Knock them dead, big brother.
- There'll be bodies all over the place.

12:36.120 --> 12:37.719
Have you got any spare change?

12:37.720 --> 12:39.679
I don't have any of your money yet.

12:39.680 --> 12:41.291
You sure about that?

12:41.800 --> 12:45.079
No, I'm not. I'll give you what I have.
I do have American money.

12:45.080 --> 12:47.203
It's just as good. Here.

12:47.240 --> 12:48.851
Um...

12:58.680 --> 12:59.927
I'm sorry.

13:00.240 --> 13:02.039
Nobody told me it already started.

13:02.040 --> 13:06.802
All right, then, just go back to, uh, "Give
me your money" or whatever the heck.

13:06.840 --> 13:10.328
- Give me the money or I'll cut you!
- Let me just do my line, first.

13:13.840 --> 13:17.039
Please don't kill me. I'll
give you all the money I got.

13:17.040 --> 13:20.199
I'll give you everything.
I got no jewelry.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.159
I just got a couple of kids.

13:22.160 --> 13:26.285
They're expecting me
to come home tonight.

13:26.360 --> 13:30.201
They don't want to see their daddy
dead on the street somewhere.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.839
I don't want to kill you.

13:39.160 --> 13:42.330
I'm sorry. I was not prepared
for any of this stuff.

13:42.440 --> 13:43.719
Just give me the money!

13:45.200 --> 13:46.447
One more.

13:48.720 --> 13:52.559
It's getting so that decent people can't
even go out on the street anymore...

13:52.560 --> 13:57.800
without scum like you trying to step
on whatever's decent in this world.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.531
But you know something?

13:59.680 --> 14:03.159
Your type are just going
to be the kind of crap...

14:03.160 --> 14:06.569
that sticks to the bottom
of a good man's loafer.

14:08.720 --> 14:13.999
I am stinking the place up. Take the
wallet and let's go on to the next scene.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.606
Come on.

14:17.680 --> 14:19.405
Take the money.

14:19.520 --> 14:21.882
You take it. He's a bloody nutter.

14:23.920 --> 14:27.279
Come back with my wallet!
Stop! Thieves!

14:27.280 --> 14:31.121
I know how much is in there!
I want it back after.

14:36.200 --> 14:38.209
Herr Schuster and Frau Schuster.

14:38.360 --> 14:40.199
My wife, Felicity, you know.

14:40.200 --> 14:41.765
How do you do?

14:41.800 --> 14:43.159
Wonderful to see you again.

14:43.160 --> 14:46.319
Rupert Witherington, our
chief overseas expert.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.119
- How do you do?
- His wife, Fiona.

14:48.120 --> 14:49.639
- Delighted.
- Sylvia.

14:49.640 --> 14:51.410
How nice to meet you.

14:51.800 --> 14:53.399
My darling daughter, Barbara.

14:53.400 --> 14:55.409
So pleased you could come.

14:55.440 --> 14:58.325
- Pleased to meet you.
- My son-in-law, and our host:

14:58.600 --> 14:59.847
James Ritchie.

15:02.640 --> 15:04.479
Pleased to meet you too.

15:04.480 --> 15:06.523
- Mr. Ritchie.
- Yes?

15:06.640 --> 15:08.888
Your brother's on the telephone.

15:09.960 --> 15:11.571
Oh.

15:12.120 --> 15:14.482
Wally? Please don't
tell me it's over.

15:14.640 --> 15:15.879
I just got mugged-

15:15.880 --> 15:20.679
Two guys with knives took my wallet.
I got nervous, they were so nervous.

15:20.680 --> 15:22.679
- I can't talk now.
- I can't talk either.

15:22.680 --> 15:24.041
I got a scene with the girl.

15:24.160 --> 15:26.840
Great. Do it with the girl
and have a wonderful time.

15:27.040 --> 15:28.526
See you later.

15:33.640 --> 15:35.444
How you doing...

15:35.920 --> 15:37.167
man?

15:46.120 --> 15:47.810
Gilbert...

15:47.920 --> 15:49.770
I've made the martinis.

15:54.360 --> 15:57.564
Be a good boy and
bring them up to me.

16:08.240 --> 16:09.930
Ugh.

16:53.080 --> 16:55.169
Gilbert sent you, didn't he?

16:57.400 --> 16:58.679
Yes, he did.

16:58.680 --> 17:00.291
You American?

17:00.960 --> 17:03.447
What are you? CIA? Mafia?

17:04.440 --> 17:05.800
Both.

17:06.400 --> 17:10.763
I wondered what death would look like.
I didn't think he'd look like you.

17:11.839 --> 17:13.280
Too scary?

17:16.400 --> 17:20.919
You gonna bring me that martini or must
I suck it from the glass from here?

17:20.920 --> 17:23.202
No, I'll bring it over.

17:26.079 --> 17:28.639
Do you think I look
silly in this outfit?

17:28.640 --> 17:30.839
I could take it off, if you'd like.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.770
Ahem. No.

17:35.440 --> 17:37.483
It's good silly.

17:38.360 --> 17:40.483
And do I get a last request?

17:41.240 --> 17:43.359
You mean like a
cigarette or something?

17:43.360 --> 17:45.961
I had something more
substantial in mind.

17:48.200 --> 17:49.526
A Cigar?

17:49.920 --> 17:51.929
Now you're boasting.

17:57.120 --> 18:00.529
- Ow!
- I'm sorry. I am so sorry. Are you all right?

18:01.600 --> 18:04.770
Oh. Oh, you were going for the gun.

18:05.640 --> 18:07.410
I didn't mean to. Here.

18:07.760 --> 18:09.039
Take it.

18:09.040 --> 18:10.605
- Take it.
- No.

18:10.840 --> 18:14.039
I'm not playing that
game, you sick bastard.

18:14.040 --> 18:15.639
Did I break your nail?

18:15.640 --> 18:18.199
If you're going to
shoot me, just do it.

18:18.200 --> 18:19.959
Just do it. Go on. Just
bloody well do it.

18:19.960 --> 18:21.241
Go on then.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.609
If I really have to.

18:26.400 --> 18:29.251
But if you do, you'll
never find the letters.

18:29.320 --> 18:32.759
Blackmailing a government
minister can be very profitable.

18:32.760 --> 18:35.440
You and I could be very, very rich.

18:37.360 --> 18:38.800
So, no death scene.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.839
What do we do now?

18:47.120 --> 18:49.479
Here's our esteemed
minister of defense.

18:49.480 --> 18:53.082
- Heh. Perfect.
- You should get rid of him.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.841
But you and I, we have
more to do together?

18:59.320 --> 19:00.601
Sure.

19:01.960 --> 19:03.359
What's your name?

19:03.360 --> 19:04.800
Lorelei.

19:05.280 --> 19:07.847
Call me Lori. What's yours?

19:08.560 --> 19:09.759
Spenser.

19:09.760 --> 19:11.325
Spenser what?

19:11.560 --> 19:13.489
They just said Spenser.

19:13.880 --> 19:15.844
Good luck, Mr. Spenser.

19:17.520 --> 19:20.041
- Thanks, Lorelei.
- Hurry back.

19:28.920 --> 19:30.485
Looking for something?

19:30.920 --> 19:32.359
Oh.

19:32.360 --> 19:36.201
My, uh... My glasses.
I was visiting a friend.

19:38.720 --> 19:39.967
Who are you?

19:40.080 --> 19:41.725
Spenser.

19:43.200 --> 19:45.926
And I know who you are too.

19:46.240 --> 19:47.566
Gilbert.

19:48.320 --> 19:52.241
Then you better get out of here,
fast, before I call the police.

19:52.640 --> 19:56.640
Okay. Let's have a scene
with the bobbies.

19:56.680 --> 19:58.879
Let's get them all in here.

19:58.880 --> 20:01.082
We'll tell them the whole thing.

20:01.360 --> 20:02.766
What whole thing?

20:04.960 --> 20:08.243
The whole plot thing.

20:08.560 --> 20:10.808
What plot thing?

20:13.520 --> 20:15.927
Uh, she told me about the letters.

20:17.720 --> 20:19.126
Letters? What letters?

20:19.320 --> 20:20.646
The letters.

20:21.040 --> 20:24.767
She told me about them.
I know all about the letters.

20:25.040 --> 20:27.208
How do you think
I know? She told me.

20:27.320 --> 20:29.090
That's how I found out.

20:48.440 --> 20:50.529
My God, Daggenhurst
sent you, didn't he?

20:52.080 --> 20:53.359
Maybe.

20:53.360 --> 20:56.928
How do I know you are
who you say you are?

20:58.120 --> 20:59.560
Oh, yeah.

21:00.160 --> 21:01.399
I got this.

21:01.400 --> 21:02.959
Then, of course you are.

21:02.960 --> 21:06.607
Dear God, I'll give you anything
you want. Just name your price.

21:06.760 --> 21:09.611
Okay. Um...

21:11.520 --> 21:12.767
Twenty.

21:12.840 --> 21:14.087
Twenty?

21:14.760 --> 21:15.961
Fifty.

21:16.240 --> 21:18.522
- Fifty!
- Mm-hm.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.399
I have to make a call.

21:20.400 --> 21:22.489
Get away from that phone!

21:29.200 --> 21:30.970
Whoa, that was loud.

21:31.560 --> 21:32.799
How'd they do that?

21:32.800 --> 21:36.925
Take this. It's all of it.
It's all of it.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.359
- But I'm sorry.
- I will give you some more.

21:40.360 --> 21:42.719
I'm sorry, I stepped
out of the scene.

21:42.720 --> 21:45.239
- It was just a loud noise.
- I'll give you lots more.

21:45.240 --> 21:47.568
I'm afraid of loud noises.

21:48.160 --> 21:51.443
Come on, let's do it again.
Let's take it from the top.

21:52.200 --> 21:53.481
Hey.

21:53.800 --> 21:56.480
You've done something
with your hair.

21:56.560 --> 21:58.679
Where's Gilbert? I heard a shot.

21:58.680 --> 22:01.479
- Gilbert's gone.
- Oh, no.

22:01.480 --> 22:03.170
You cut it.

22:03.560 --> 22:06.039
Look, when I said get rid
of him, I didn't mean...

22:06.040 --> 22:08.481
- This is a very nice look for you.
- Thanks.

22:10.400 --> 22:13.479
Why don't you look out the
front and see if it's clear?

22:13.480 --> 22:15.170
Sure.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.247
Help!

23:23.320 --> 23:24.646
Ow!

23:44.680 --> 23:46.484
Spenser!

23:46.800 --> 23:49.759
Pleased to meet you, girlie.
Where are the letters?

23:49.760 --> 23:53.719
Spenser! Spenser!

23:53.720 --> 23:55.001
Coming!

23:55.400 --> 23:56.726
Help me!

23:57.400 --> 23:59.409
Yeah, I'm coming.

23:59.520 --> 24:02.564
- Door's locked.
- Kick it in!

24:05.000 --> 24:07.039
It's, uh... It's solid.

24:07.040 --> 24:10.050
It's not, uh... It's
not balsa or anything.

24:10.200 --> 24:12.199
Spenser, he's trying to kill me!

24:12.200 --> 24:13.759
Okay. All right, all right.

24:13.760 --> 24:15.883
Please hurry!

24:17.040 --> 24:19.561
Spenser, what are you doing?

24:24.920 --> 24:26.326
Here's Johnny!

24:28.840 --> 24:30.201
Hurry.

24:37.880 --> 24:40.359
Aah. What have we here?

24:40.360 --> 24:44.770
Conveniently found a mallet outside,
but I'm going to swap it for this one.

24:46.080 --> 24:47.884
All right, punk.

24:48.240 --> 24:52.650
I guess the question you got to ask
yourself today is, "Do I feel lucky?"

24:53.240 --> 24:55.283
Well, punk, do you?

24:57.560 --> 24:58.807
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

25:01.240 --> 25:04.599
Don't ever show your
face on this mews again!

25:06.640 --> 25:09.479
Come on. We've got
to get out of here.

25:09.480 --> 25:11.409
Come on.

25:12.440 --> 25:14.802
Let's go. Go, go!

25:14.920 --> 25:19.719
<i>I thought I could get the letters and
then some maniac called Spenser...</i>

25:19.720 --> 25:22.605
<i>who says he works for you,
fired a pistol at me!</i>

25:23.280 --> 25:27.451
Listen, we are too close
to let this fall apart.

25:28.200 --> 25:29.970
Now, listen.

25:30.960 --> 25:35.131
There is a loose cannon out there and
I want him dealt with immediately.

25:55.520 --> 25:57.679
- Sir Roger.
- Just think, Hawkins.

25:57.680 --> 26:02.522
This time next week, these lights
will be flashing all across Russia.

26:03.440 --> 26:05.519
This room will be alive again...

26:05.520 --> 26:08.371
with happy voices and the
patter of little feet.

26:08.480 --> 26:13.163
Voices from across Europe
being monitored and decoded.

26:13.520 --> 26:17.039
The feet of agents rushing
in with urgent communiqués.

26:17.040 --> 26:18.359
The new funding...

26:18.360 --> 26:20.449
new equipment.

26:20.760 --> 26:23.611
New weapons, new poisons.

26:23.800 --> 26:26.719
Happy days, Hawkins. Happy days.

26:26.720 --> 26:28.079
Yes, Sir Roger.

26:28.080 --> 26:32.799
Um, it seems there's a
bit of a problem...

26:32.800 --> 26:34.359
with Spenser and the girl.

26:34.360 --> 26:35.919
Problem?

26:35.920 --> 26:39.567
Embleton tried to collect the
letters, Spenser tried to shoot him.

26:40.080 --> 26:41.611
Shoot him?

26:41.760 --> 26:44.486
Embleton says he seemed
a trifle unhinged.

26:44.600 --> 26:46.325
But what about the girl?

26:46.360 --> 26:48.439
This is totally unacceptable.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.802
The zero hour is a mere...

26:50.920 --> 26:53.009
three hours and 12 minutes away.

26:54.400 --> 26:57.079
It's not possible. With a mere...

26:57.080 --> 27:00.439
three hours, 11 minutes
till zero hour?

27:00.440 --> 27:02.005
<i>Keep calm.</i>

27:02.200 --> 27:05.483
We'll send in the plumbers
to flush Spenser.

27:05.760 --> 27:07.724
I call in Boris from deep cover.

27:08.840 --> 27:10.849
Boris Blavasky?

27:11.560 --> 27:15.446
The maniac who decapitated
poor old Ponsonby in Helsinki?

27:15.480 --> 27:16.919
Boris the Butcher?

27:24.880 --> 27:26.359
Phone for you, love.

27:26.360 --> 27:27.891
Thank you, sweetie.

28:05.120 --> 28:07.527
I know you, Sergei Nikolivich.

28:07.960 --> 28:11.721
There's more to this
than just dirty letters.

28:12.040 --> 28:15.005
Why so gloomy? Is better
than being butcher.

28:15.160 --> 28:16.885
I like being butcher.

28:17.320 --> 28:19.887
You know exactly who
you are killing...

28:22.720 --> 28:24.251
and why.

28:31.520 --> 28:32.919
<i>What impresses me most...</i>

28:32.920 --> 28:35.407
during our visits to
Germany are his people.

28:35.440 --> 28:40.043
There's a warmth, a quiet charm.
Everyone welcomes you with open arms.

28:40.840 --> 28:43.039
You're sure you were in Germany?

28:44.240 --> 28:45.851
Downtown Brussels.

28:47.640 --> 28:50.491
- Wally.
- Hello, everybody. Jimmy's brother.

28:50.520 --> 28:52.039
Don't get up.

28:52.040 --> 28:53.571
What happened?

28:53.840 --> 28:56.879
Uh, we need a place to
lie low for a while.

28:56.880 --> 28:59.242
I thought this place would be safe.

28:59.400 --> 29:02.126
Won't you introduce
us to your friend?

29:02.240 --> 29:04.283
Oh. Everybody...

29:04.400 --> 29:05.965
this is Lori.

29:06.320 --> 29:08.319
She's the defense
minister's call girl.

29:08.320 --> 29:12.119
- Bastard!
- Ow! Hey.

29:12.120 --> 29:13.765
That really hurt.

29:13.880 --> 29:16.242
I should've called
her an actress, heh.

29:16.680 --> 29:18.882
Ha. She's great.

29:19.120 --> 29:23.079
Jimmy paid for the whole thing.
I should go, I suppose.

29:23.080 --> 29:24.319
Okay, bye.

29:24.320 --> 29:28.081
We got these smutty letters we're going
to blackmail some guy with. Heh.

29:28.640 --> 29:31.446
Okay. Heh. Okay.

29:31.760 --> 29:33.007
Later, huh?

29:33.360 --> 29:35.847
See you. Ha, ha.

29:37.720 --> 29:40.241
What line of work
is your brother in?

29:43.080 --> 29:45.359
He's in the movie business.

29:47.080 --> 29:48.850
The movie business. Of course.

29:49.160 --> 29:51.879
I'm sorry I was a
little insensitive.

29:51.880 --> 29:54.447
But, you know, I'm a hit man.

29:55.600 --> 29:57.802
I'm only going to say this once.

29:57.880 --> 29:59.599
I'm not a call girl.

29:59.600 --> 30:00.847
I met Gilbert.

30:01.080 --> 30:04.807
He liked giving me money.
I needed it. So I let him, okay?

30:07.760 --> 30:09.291
Was that a tear?

30:10.800 --> 30:12.490
How do you people do it?

30:13.240 --> 30:16.091
Do you poke yourself in the eye?

30:16.720 --> 30:19.161
Or are you thinking right now:

30:19.440 --> 30:21.847
"My dog is dead"?

30:23.120 --> 30:25.119
What's the matter with you?

30:25.120 --> 30:26.970
Are you enjoying this?

30:27.040 --> 30:28.605
Enormously.

30:29.600 --> 30:31.609
My dog is dead.

30:35.240 --> 30:37.010
My dog is dead.

31:06.600 --> 31:11.479
The letters are upstairs in the spare room.
You go get them. I'll keep watch, okay?

31:11.480 --> 31:13.359
Yeah, sure, pintsize.

31:13.360 --> 31:16.039
Last time we split up,
you locked the door...

31:16.040 --> 31:18.799
and got strangled.
Let's go in together.

31:18.800 --> 31:20.679
You don't trust me, do you?

31:20.680 --> 31:23.119
Say it. Go on, say it.

31:23.120 --> 31:24.639
I don't trust you?

31:24.640 --> 31:25.887
Wait.

31:26.800 --> 31:28.365
I don't trust you.

31:37.240 --> 31:40.250
Are we all going to stay
afterwards and clean up?

31:42.080 --> 31:46.126
Whoa. I think Goldilocks
wears Old Spice.

32:00.360 --> 32:02.239
You should pay your light bill.

32:02.240 --> 32:04.761
There's a lamp over
there on the table.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.359
Oh, God!

32:18.360 --> 32:19.721
Gosh!

32:22.040 --> 32:24.129
You got me. Did he get you?

32:25.240 --> 32:28.250
- You got both of us.
- I've never seen a dead body before.

32:28.560 --> 32:30.359
I've seen lots, but this is...

32:30.360 --> 32:31.839
Boo!

32:31.840 --> 32:33.159
What're you doing?

32:33.160 --> 32:35.439
You gotta check and see
just how dead they are.

32:35.440 --> 32:39.247
You can never be sure. Guy
could be able to catch this!

32:42.880 --> 32:44.127
I'm impressed.

32:44.440 --> 32:46.039
You are so twisted.

32:46.040 --> 32:51.199
I would think you'd be impressed by, uh,
the kind of concentration that is being...

32:54.080 --> 32:55.486
Oh, man!

32:55.720 --> 32:59.322
I feel sick. Do you think you
trust me to go to the loo?

32:59.400 --> 33:02.919
The loo. Ha-ha-ha.

33:02.920 --> 33:05.964
Off to the loo with you. Heh, heh.

33:08.120 --> 33:09.679
I know you worked together...

33:09.680 --> 33:14.488
but if I find the letters before she does,
it'd be a real hoot. How about a clue?

33:17.280 --> 33:19.801
Do you know anything
about this girl?

33:20.240 --> 33:22.488
Is she going out with
anybody in the cast?

33:23.120 --> 33:25.482
<i>Spenser? Are you there, Spenser?</i>

33:25.800 --> 33:27.159
Do that again.

33:27.160 --> 33:29.647
<i>Spenser? What's going on?
Are you receiving me?</i>

33:30.920 --> 33:33.159
You jerk. You've got a radio.

33:33.160 --> 33:36.250
<i>Spenser, come in immediately.
This is a 42-20.</i>

33:36.920 --> 33:38.645
Cool.

33:39.120 --> 33:42.244
Hello. Spenser, here. Have
no fear. What's your 20?

33:43.320 --> 33:45.124
What's he talking about?

33:45.160 --> 33:48.523
- Why is he using that American accent?
- Cover.

33:49.440 --> 33:52.041
Ask him if he's
eliminated the girl.

33:52.520 --> 33:56.850
Spenser. Did you take the
girl to the bathroom?

33:56.960 --> 33:58.159
No.

33:58.160 --> 34:00.159
She went to the loo...

34:00.160 --> 34:02.203
by herself.

34:03.280 --> 34:04.641
By herself?

34:05.160 --> 34:06.407
Suicide.

34:06.480 --> 34:08.887
Finally, a spot of luck.

34:09.280 --> 34:11.880
Ask him if he has
disposed of the body.

34:12.440 --> 34:14.847
Spenser. Did you flush?

34:15.320 --> 34:18.126
I think she's going to
do that, don't you, pal?

34:18.360 --> 34:20.164
<i>I'll ask her. Lori!</i>

34:20.800 --> 34:22.525
He's talking to her.

34:23.199 --> 34:25.159
She's still in the bowl?

34:25.159 --> 34:27.239
Maybe he tried but
she floated back up.

34:27.239 --> 34:31.679
Tell him to flush her. Spenser
knows how to deal with floaters.

34:31.679 --> 34:34.246
Tell him to use the
plunger or we're sunk.

34:43.080 --> 34:44.406
Oh, no.

34:45.040 --> 34:48.518
Listen here, you have
to recycle the waste.

34:48.520 --> 34:53.043
I don't know if we mentioned it, but
there's a time limit on the operation.

34:53.199 --> 34:56.199
I figure you got to tie up
all your loose ends by...

34:56.199 --> 34:58.607
11:30 at the latest.

34:59.680 --> 35:01.928
- Did you tell him?
- Of course not.

35:04.880 --> 35:09.085
Spenser, how did you arrive
at that hour specifically?

35:09.240 --> 35:10.919
For one thing...

35:10.920 --> 35:16.081
I know a couple of guys who are hoping to
fire up some big Ambassadors at 11:59.

35:19.200 --> 35:22.239
Disaster!

35:22.240 --> 35:24.442
He knows every detail.

35:32.040 --> 35:35.642
Keep him talking, sir. The
plumbers will be there any minute.

35:36.920 --> 35:39.719
I think I've screwed you
guys completely up.

35:39.720 --> 35:41.490
I'm way off the script.

35:41.560 --> 35:46.288
I should've gone into the bathroom
and flushed her and everything else.

35:46.560 --> 35:49.879
I'm just gonna recycle her now,
and we'll go from there, okay?

35:49.880 --> 35:51.650
<i>Spenser.</i>

35:52.240 --> 35:53.771
<i>- Come in.</i>
- Over and out.

35:54.640 --> 35:56.251
Lori.

36:01.360 --> 36:04.609
Lori. We know you're out there.

36:05.960 --> 36:09.279
So you've decided to
recycle me after all.

36:09.280 --> 36:13.485
I think it'll be a little bit easier,
a lot less confusion for everyone.

36:14.240 --> 36:17.091
- Sure, right.
- Thank you. Over here, then.

36:21.360 --> 36:23.210
All right, say cheese.

36:23.240 --> 36:24.851
Let's find the letters.

36:27.640 --> 36:30.127
Oh, my God, what have I done?

36:30.640 --> 36:32.888
From three feet, I missed you.

36:35.600 --> 36:36.926
I thought that was it.

36:42.440 --> 36:45.211
- We gotta get out of here.
- We do?

36:45.280 --> 36:46.686
Oh, great.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.565
Come on!

36:53.600 --> 36:54.926
Very good news.

36:55.120 --> 36:56.401
Excuse us.

37:12.040 --> 37:13.287
Hold it.

37:14.720 --> 37:16.001
What?

37:16.080 --> 37:19.250
I'd just like to do one thing.
I'll be right down.

37:22.440 --> 37:26.440
I have a lot more appreciation
for what you people go through.

37:26.520 --> 37:28.722
Thanks. Nice working with you.

37:28.760 --> 37:30.610
Oh. The letters.

37:30.880 --> 37:34.607
You are the best. Thanks
for making it fun.

37:35.080 --> 37:36.725
- Freeze!
- Don't move!

37:41.760 --> 37:43.121
Hello?

37:44.440 --> 37:46.290
Wait up, Lori!

37:47.400 --> 37:48.726
The letters!

37:49.440 --> 37:51.085
Watch the foot.

37:51.600 --> 37:52.881
Mail call.

38:05.120 --> 38:07.800
Look what I found.

38:09.560 --> 38:12.411
You're not going to give
them to me, are you?

38:12.440 --> 38:13.799
Um, no.

38:13.800 --> 38:16.924
For half a second there, I thought
I saw a real human being.

38:17.760 --> 38:20.201
Nobody asked me to
be a human being.

38:22.160 --> 38:24.601
- Why don't we change it?
- Change it?

38:24.720 --> 38:27.279
What were you going to do
with these? I'll help you.

38:27.280 --> 38:29.005
Why would you do that?

38:29.080 --> 38:31.442
Because I'd much
rather be a good guy.

38:31.800 --> 38:33.729
You're not just acting?

38:34.080 --> 38:36.079
Well, we both are.

38:36.080 --> 38:38.601
In the Theater of Life, I mean.

38:39.240 --> 38:41.169
I suppose we are.

38:50.440 --> 38:54.122
You know, I'm helping
you out, but...

38:54.640 --> 38:56.922
I'm not a completely good guy.

38:56.960 --> 39:00.642
There's something I want, and
you're gonna have to let me do it.

39:02.800 --> 39:05.810
- It's like that, is it?
- I'm afraid so.

39:07.480 --> 39:09.170
Typical man.

39:11.080 --> 39:13.679
Oh, that feels good.

39:14.960 --> 39:19.006
Thanks a lot. It was really
kind of you to let me drive.

39:26.440 --> 39:30.326
So partner. What are you going to
do with your share of the money?

39:30.600 --> 39:33.041
I'm going to get out
of here, for a start.

39:33.440 --> 39:37.440
Go to New York, buy a flat
and I'm gonna study acting.

39:38.240 --> 39:41.125
You don't need acting
school. You're a natural.

39:41.520 --> 39:43.529
- Think so?
- Know so.

39:48.880 --> 39:50.399
Other side!

39:58.640 --> 40:01.161
He's good. Aah.

40:02.080 --> 40:06.039
<i>The stars are out tonight as
statesmen and celebrities roll up...</i>

40:06.040 --> 40:09.119
<i>to celebrate the signing of
the Midnight Peace Accord...</i>

40:09.120 --> 40:12.519
<i>by the leaders of Russia
and Great Britain.</i>

40:12.520 --> 40:15.999
<i>After many months of shuttle diplomacy
and behind-the-scenes negotiations...</i>

40:18.040 --> 40:22.802
Listen, Sergei, you said, "Kill
Spenser, kill girl and get letters."

40:22.840 --> 40:25.719
You said nothing about
American Superman.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.361
Daggenhurst here.

40:34.480 --> 40:36.719
You did not tell me
about American agent!

40:36.720 --> 40:39.439
- Say again.
- Don't play with me!

40:39.440 --> 40:43.087
If we cannot trust each other, how
can we bring back Cold War together?

40:43.120 --> 40:48.399
Now, listen here, comrade. I know
nothing about any American agent.

40:48.400 --> 40:52.719
If you're afraid your pinpoint bomb
can't take out that top table...

40:52.720 --> 40:54.365
at least tell me.

40:54.400 --> 40:56.519
Russian explosive is perfect!

40:56.520 --> 41:01.567
Will destroy everything in five-meter
circle and nothing outside!

41:01.600 --> 41:05.566
Maybe you do not trust
made-in-Britain timing mechanism!

41:05.720 --> 41:09.447
If your chap, Boris, has botched
the job, I'm sure that my...

41:09.560 --> 41:11.199
What is it?

41:11.200 --> 41:14.679
The plumbers say an
American killed Spenser...

41:14.680 --> 41:18.123
kidnapped the girl, grabbed
the letters and got away.

41:19.240 --> 41:21.966
Doesn't that just bite it?

41:24.240 --> 41:28.968
Hello, Sergei, I think we may
have a bit of a problem.

41:35.880 --> 41:37.639
Police. Quick. Turn the lights on.

41:37.640 --> 41:39.239
- They're on.
- License?

41:39.240 --> 41:41.169
Relax, the van is kosher.

41:43.720 --> 41:47.119
Wait a minute. Are those
real cops? Ha-ha-ha.

41:47.120 --> 41:50.119
Good point. It could
be Gilbert's men.

41:50.120 --> 41:52.129
We gotta lose them. Move it!

41:52.240 --> 41:53.879
I'd love to.

41:55.800 --> 41:57.570
We got a right one here now.

41:59.320 --> 42:01.727
Follow him. Keep following.

42:01.880 --> 42:03.684
Who's going to stop here?

42:03.840 --> 42:05.371
Sorry, coming through.

42:18.520 --> 42:20.131
I follow.

42:21.280 --> 42:24.563
- Follow, no follow, you cretin!
- This van is rubbish!

42:24.600 --> 42:27.959
It's not the van! This man
is good! He's very good!

42:32.640 --> 42:37.479
Oh, man, they give you a real car
chase. You get to smash their stuff.

42:37.480 --> 42:40.319
You guys can't be
making a dime on this.

42:40.320 --> 42:42.959
Come and get me, coppers!

42:49.000 --> 42:50.565
What's he on?

42:51.000 --> 42:53.407
Ha-ha-ha. This is great.

42:57.800 --> 42:59.081
Here comes trouble.

42:59.240 --> 43:00.965
Don't exhale.

43:07.840 --> 43:09.639
Want me to call for backup or what?

43:09.640 --> 43:12.279
For a bloody Mini?
You must be joking.

43:14.640 --> 43:16.683
All my life I've wanted to do this.

43:21.040 --> 43:23.159
I've always wanted to do that.

43:23.160 --> 43:24.930
Yeah. Me too.

43:28.200 --> 43:31.324
- That's gonna cost him.
- We're losing them.

43:32.800 --> 43:35.731
Oops! Sorry. Force of habit. Heh.

43:42.080 --> 43:44.521
Absolutely bloody brilliant.

43:45.280 --> 43:46.686
Spenser, stop.

43:46.840 --> 43:48.041
Come on.

43:48.160 --> 43:50.010
Spenser, stop it.

43:50.080 --> 43:51.281
I feel sick.

43:55.560 --> 43:58.650
Sod this. Hang on, Bill.
Clench your buttocks.

44:02.680 --> 44:04.291
Where'd they go?

44:12.200 --> 44:14.999
- That was fun.
- Ha, ha.

44:15.000 --> 44:17.885
Tomorrow night, I wanna
go, um, this way.

44:18.200 --> 44:21.839
I don't think it's fair for these guys.
They can't possibly stay with me...

44:21.840 --> 44:23.319
going right to left.

44:23.320 --> 44:24.999
- Ooh. I like mine.
- Ha-ha-ha.

44:25.000 --> 44:28.886
I think I saw his face
in a dream someplace.

44:30.440 --> 44:33.689
Would you mind stepping out
of the car, please, sir?

44:38.800 --> 44:41.399
You want to tell me what
you think you were doing?

44:41.400 --> 44:43.523
Back in the straightaway...

44:44.080 --> 44:45.319
95.

44:45.320 --> 44:47.839
I could've gone faster,
but I'd have lost you.

44:47.840 --> 44:49.530
You too, young lady.

44:52.520 --> 44:54.839
I hope you two are
secure in your work...

44:54.840 --> 44:57.919
because my husband's on
urgent government business.

44:57.920 --> 44:59.239
Really?

44:59.240 --> 45:03.525
You'd better stop staring at my legs, too,
otherwise he's gonna get really jealous.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.039
Can I see your driving
license, sir?

45:06.040 --> 45:09.164
No, you may not!

45:10.440 --> 45:13.769
The guys in the first scene
have already taken it.

45:14.440 --> 45:16.279
I'll show you my two-way radio...

45:16.280 --> 45:20.121
with which you may communicate
directly with my superiors.

45:20.320 --> 45:25.242
Breaker, breaker. Coming out there
for that old H.Q. Come on back.

45:25.920 --> 45:27.439
Very funny, sir.

45:27.440 --> 45:31.565
Mind if I have myself a cigarette while
I wait for Scotty to beam me up?

45:31.600 --> 45:32.926
Knock yourself out.

45:33.080 --> 45:35.760
<i>Yes, come in. We're receiving you.</i>

45:37.080 --> 45:39.362
Go ahead and say hi.

45:41.080 --> 45:42.725
Uh...

45:42.840 --> 45:45.008
- Hello?
<i>- Who is this?</i>

45:46.440 --> 45:50.725
Police Constable Cochrane
from Shepherd's Bush.

45:51.240 --> 45:54.330
What are you doing using
one of our communicators?

45:55.640 --> 45:59.686
Uh, this gentleman refused to
show me any identification.

45:59.840 --> 46:03.840
Of course he didn't show you any
identification. He's a secret agent.

46:03.920 --> 46:05.724
<i>Put me on to him at once.</i>

46:08.920 --> 46:10.799
Heh. I'm sorry, sir.

46:10.800 --> 46:14.527
It's all right. You're just doing
your job. I'm proud of you.

46:15.640 --> 46:16.999
This is Spense.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.931
So you're still calling
yourself that, are you?

46:20.240 --> 46:22.727
I think I just might, until 11:30.

46:23.160 --> 46:25.203
How he mocks us.

46:25.440 --> 46:27.210
What do you want?

46:29.440 --> 46:31.563
Would you, uh, excuse
me one second?

46:31.760 --> 46:33.371
Uh, of course.

46:35.720 --> 46:38.651
May I step out of character
for just one minute?

46:38.760 --> 46:40.007
I wish you would.

46:40.080 --> 46:44.683
I think the reason my brother got me
into this was to impress the Germans.

46:45.080 --> 46:47.521
<i>And if it ends here
with the police...</i>

46:47.680 --> 46:49.639
I don't think he's gonna be happy.

46:49.640 --> 46:52.923
But I think we can offer you
a more rewarding scenario...

46:53.120 --> 46:55.721
<i>- ...than the police could provide.</i>
- Great.

46:55.920 --> 46:57.159
Fabulous.

46:57.160 --> 46:59.840
Would you give us a
moment to confer?

47:00.280 --> 47:02.439
How much left in the slush fund?

47:02.440 --> 47:03.679
A million and a half.

47:03.680 --> 47:07.043
- And Sergei's?
- The same. If we arrange a meeting...

47:08.440 --> 47:09.679
They're fixing it.

47:09.680 --> 47:10.919
Oh, great.

47:10.920 --> 47:14.679
Great handcuffs. The ones I've
got have a chain in the middle.

47:14.680 --> 47:17.119
- Yeah, the old ones.
- I love these.

47:17.120 --> 47:19.322
So what's the pay like, then?

47:21.640 --> 47:23.729
They pay all your expenses.

47:24.960 --> 47:27.003
You're licensed to kill.

47:27.800 --> 47:29.639
But there's a downside.

47:29.640 --> 47:30.966
What's that?

47:33.360 --> 47:34.846
Torture.

47:34.960 --> 47:36.650
Mm.

47:38.800 --> 47:40.729
There's the women, though.

47:41.800 --> 47:44.890
They're nice after the
torture. Believe me.

47:45.880 --> 47:47.879
Not much of a car they give you.

47:47.880 --> 47:49.730
It's a piece of crap.

47:50.520 --> 47:53.359
- I got an Aston Martin.
- Oh.

47:53.360 --> 47:55.719
Had trouble with the
surface-to-air missiles.

47:55.720 --> 47:58.127
It's in the shop.

47:58.880 --> 48:01.242
This will not be easy.

48:03.000 --> 48:04.611
The man has...

48:04.680 --> 48:06.245
connections.

48:07.680 --> 48:09.564
<i>Come in, Spenser.</i>

48:09.720 --> 48:10.959
This is Spenser.

48:10.960 --> 48:15.529
We'll give you three million in
unmarked bills for the letters.

48:18.680 --> 48:20.450
- Three million.
- Yes!

48:24.120 --> 48:25.810
I guess we'll take it.

48:25.880 --> 48:28.679
Be in the lobby of the
Grand Plaza London...

48:28.680 --> 48:31.406
in 20 minutes.

48:38.760 --> 48:40.246
Keep it coming.

48:47.360 --> 48:50.086
- Do you mind?
- Thank you, bloke.

48:51.760 --> 48:53.246
You get a load of this?

48:56.320 --> 48:57.521
What's that?

48:58.400 --> 49:00.602
Uh, for allergies.

49:02.720 --> 49:04.160
Actually...

49:04.800 --> 49:06.639
it's a powerful agent...

49:06.640 --> 49:10.401
that sharpens my senses,
yet deadens my emotions.

49:11.120 --> 49:13.687
I could do with some
of that, sometimes.

49:14.240 --> 49:16.124
What about our story?

49:16.280 --> 49:18.519
Are we just a doomed couple?

49:18.520 --> 49:20.799
We have to be Bonnie and Clyde?

49:20.800 --> 49:22.729
Can't it be like The Getaway?

49:22.800 --> 49:24.604
Couldn't it be like that?

49:26.320 --> 49:28.010
Could be.

49:28.280 --> 49:30.130
You're acting.

49:30.240 --> 49:31.805
I'm not acting.

49:32.120 --> 49:33.367
Are you?

49:33.840 --> 49:35.451
Honestly...

49:35.760 --> 49:37.530
I can't act. Heh.

49:49.000 --> 49:50.804
But I can do action.

50:18.800 --> 50:22.199
We at Featherstone Finch
believe our major strength...

50:22.200 --> 50:23.399
is diversity.

50:24.560 --> 50:27.159
Leave it, the machine will
get it. And diversity...

50:27.160 --> 50:30.284
<i>I just kissed the girl
I was with earlier.</i>

50:30.720 --> 50:33.924
<i>She's got lips like your sofa.</i>

50:34.600 --> 50:38.839
<i>Talk about big-car comfort. Wow.
And it wasn't just a "kiss" kiss.</i>

50:38.840 --> 50:42.159
The past five years have seen
astonishing worldwide growth...

50:42.160 --> 50:45.559
with sexports... exports
increased by 700 percent.

50:45.560 --> 50:49.119
<i>I want to do this every
single day I'm here.</i>

50:49.120 --> 50:51.399
<i>Either that was her tongue
or she's got three lips.</i>

50:51.400 --> 50:52.599
Hold it, Wally.

50:52.600 --> 50:57.089
A truly remarkable record. If you'll
excuse me for just one minute.

51:00.720 --> 51:02.251
Wally. What's the problem?

51:02.400 --> 51:06.241
Uh, it's not a problem, but
you know those Ambassadors?

51:07.360 --> 51:09.359
Do you think we could...

51:09.360 --> 51:12.131
smoke them over here where I am...

51:12.200 --> 51:13.679
at the Grand Plaza London?

51:13.680 --> 51:19.239
Because it's already 10:30 and I really
would like to smoke them on my day.

51:19.240 --> 51:23.079
I can't. Think maybe we could
have those smokes tomorrow night?

51:23.080 --> 51:25.919
I say, old chap, do have time?

51:25.920 --> 51:27.804
Yes, 10:30.

51:28.080 --> 51:31.568
Matey, you just stabbed
me with your pen.

51:33.400 --> 51:34.647
Daddy...

51:35.120 --> 51:38.642
can I please borrow the
keys to the station wagon?

51:44.680 --> 51:46.882
Wally? Wally?

51:54.080 --> 51:56.362
Hello, Theater of Life.

51:56.520 --> 51:59.724
This is Mr. Ritchie. My
brother is doing your show.

51:59.760 --> 52:01.371
Wait there, sir.

52:02.080 --> 52:03.611
It's Ritchie.

52:04.480 --> 52:07.365
- Trace this call.
- I want to ask...

52:07.480 --> 52:10.286
We want to question him in
connection with a murder.

52:10.560 --> 52:13.240
And the call girl too.
I know, I paid for it.

52:13.720 --> 52:16.366
Mr. Ritchie, this is Chief
Inspector Cockburn.

52:16.720 --> 52:21.919
So now you're the chief. Listen, chief.
Please step out of character for a minute.

52:21.920 --> 52:24.600
You don't realize the
seriousness of the situation.

52:24.920 --> 52:27.202
Is this an actor now
or a human being?

52:27.520 --> 52:29.324
Neither, sir. I'm a policeman.

52:29.640 --> 52:31.729
Okay. Fine, Mr. Policeman...

52:31.840 --> 52:35.079
I need to buy more time and
I'll pay you handsomely for it.

52:35.080 --> 52:37.567
Are you attempting
to bribe an officer?

52:37.720 --> 52:40.479
Do you torture everybody like
this, or just Americans?

52:40.480 --> 52:44.399
Look, Mr. Shakespeare, yes,
yes, I want to bribe you.

52:44.400 --> 52:46.648
Is the prime minister
there? I'll bribe him!

52:46.680 --> 52:50.079
<i>Anybody who will talk to me! You
invented the language, talk to me!</i>

52:50.080 --> 52:54.251
No wonder you lost the empire!
You know what? Scotland's next!

52:54.440 --> 52:55.801
<i>Yes or no?</i>

52:56.160 --> 52:59.523
Yes or no, you socialist,
artsy-fartsy little dweeb.

52:59.760 --> 53:02.804
- Mr. Ritchie, sir...
- Okay, fine.

53:03.040 --> 53:05.879
You won't help us,
it's not a problem.

53:05.880 --> 53:08.606
We'll do something else. Thank you.

53:11.440 --> 53:12.926
American.

53:13.240 --> 53:14.487
Charlie...

53:14.720 --> 53:17.399
it's just a hunch, but I think
we might be dealing with...

53:17.400 --> 53:21.127
some sort of right-wing
extremist what-have-you.

53:23.400 --> 53:25.284
Did you trace that call?

53:25.440 --> 53:27.608
- I'm an actor.
- Right.

53:28.120 --> 53:30.159
- Did you trace that call?
- Yes, sir.

53:30.160 --> 53:31.679
40 Overbridge Square.

53:31.680 --> 53:33.245
Right. Charlie.

53:34.600 --> 53:38.850
Call out the Armed Response Unit.
I want this thing crushed, right now.

53:40.440 --> 53:43.599
Thanks. These actors
don't know when to stop.

53:43.600 --> 53:45.325
No, Mr. Ritchie.

53:46.120 --> 53:49.439
<i>The theater community
at large are asking:</i>

53:49.440 --> 53:52.962
<i>What went wrong with the
Theater of Life tonight?</i>

53:53.280 --> 53:56.519
<i>The police are anxious to
interview a Mr. Wallace Ritchie...</i>

53:56.520 --> 53:59.319
<i>an American, dark,
about six foot...</i>

53:59.320 --> 54:02.842
<i>and believed to be armed
and extremely dangerous.</i>

54:04.520 --> 54:06.961
- Ah, there you are, James.
- Ah, there you are, finally.

54:07.120 --> 54:10.642
Yes, indeed. Before we
continue, I'm going to...

54:10.960 --> 54:12.525
pop down to the cellar.

54:12.680 --> 54:15.929
- There's a nice bottle of port.
- We've already got one.

54:16.120 --> 54:20.450
True. But it's very dark there and
it might take me a few minutes.

54:20.480 --> 54:22.887
But I'll be back with the port.

54:25.560 --> 54:26.966
And the car keys.

54:27.360 --> 54:29.005
Oh, dear.

54:31.840 --> 54:33.399
Who's wearing Old Spice?

54:33.400 --> 54:35.841
- Shut up.
- I found letters.

54:36.040 --> 54:37.321
But no identification.

54:37.560 --> 54:40.919
Of course not, idiot.
He's a professional.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.519
Everybody wants to
check minibar. Go away!

54:45.520 --> 54:46.999
It's the plumbers!

54:47.000 --> 54:50.119
Those sons of bitches
blew up my Nikita in '79.

54:50.120 --> 54:51.319
Nikita was vicious...

54:51.320 --> 54:54.000
Forget about your dog.
Open the door.

54:54.080 --> 54:56.886
Easy for you to say. He's
my dog, not your dog.

54:58.640 --> 54:59.839
Come on.

54:59.840 --> 55:02.042
Let go of me.

55:02.480 --> 55:05.159
- Hi.
- Get off me!

55:05.160 --> 55:09.599
Hi. I thought you were
staying in the car.

55:10.800 --> 55:13.399
This is busier than my
butcher shop! Go away!

55:13.400 --> 55:15.409
Sergei Nikolivich. Open up.

55:16.200 --> 55:18.721
Oh. Heh, don't shoot. Ha-ha-ha.

55:18.840 --> 55:20.849
Good to see you.

55:21.040 --> 55:23.129
Here we have our man, in the flesh.

55:23.200 --> 55:25.519
How am I supposed to do my work?

55:25.520 --> 55:27.439
Stop complaining. Give
me the letters. Quick.

55:31.720 --> 55:35.208
So this is him, in the flesh.

55:35.720 --> 55:37.524
Where are the letters?

55:38.360 --> 55:42.406
Spenser, do something. Those
are my letters. Bastards!

55:42.680 --> 55:46.119
Come, Sir Roger. We are
overdue for banqueting room.

55:46.120 --> 55:48.129
Splendid.

55:53.720 --> 55:55.285
I think...

55:55.680 --> 55:58.565
we begin with soft tissue.

56:05.400 --> 56:07.239
Mr. Prime Minister...

56:07.240 --> 56:08.885
Mr. President...

56:09.080 --> 56:11.089
distinguished guests...

56:11.520 --> 56:14.405
my lords, ladies and gentlemen...

56:15.360 --> 56:19.246
it's my duty and privilege
to welcome you this evening.

56:19.600 --> 56:22.239
Before that historic
moment at midnight...

56:22.240 --> 56:26.286
when the peace accord is signed
between our two countries...

56:26.600 --> 56:28.599
we shall be treated to...

56:28.600 --> 56:32.079
music and dance that seek
to embody the souls...

56:32.080 --> 56:35.250
of these two great nations.

56:39.240 --> 56:40.601
Boris.

56:41.120 --> 56:45.291
- Before torture, we try truth serum? Yes?
- Please.

56:46.960 --> 56:48.241
Okay.

57:01.120 --> 57:04.927
Are you a member of our
Frequent Renters' Club?

57:05.280 --> 57:07.130
We would like to be.

57:07.200 --> 57:09.209
We have a two-night rental policy.

57:09.360 --> 57:13.804
If the tape stays out longer than that,
you're not charged the extra $1.50.

57:14.440 --> 57:16.279
What is your real name?

57:16.280 --> 57:18.164
Wallace Ritchie.

57:18.960 --> 57:21.003
Who is paying for all this?

57:21.320 --> 57:23.807
My brother Jimmy. He's, uh...

57:24.120 --> 57:28.211
trying to impress the Germans so
he gave me this for my birthday.

57:28.480 --> 57:30.762
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

57:31.000 --> 57:32.361
Thank you.

57:32.800 --> 57:34.684
Who you are working for?

57:34.800 --> 57:38.163
Blockbuster Video,
Des Moines, Iowa.

57:39.120 --> 57:41.004
Who you are working for?

57:41.320 --> 57:44.171
Blockbuster Video,
Des Moines, Iowa.

57:44.280 --> 57:45.527
Damn.

57:45.640 --> 57:47.524
They trained him so well.

57:47.640 --> 57:52.562
Give him the antidote. I do it
old-fashioned way. I beat it out of him.

58:01.480 --> 58:03.887
Oops. This real pen. Heh.

58:04.000 --> 58:05.279
Idiot.

58:05.280 --> 58:07.528
I have antidote here.

58:11.640 --> 58:13.559
That is so refreshing.

58:13.560 --> 58:15.879
May I have one of those
when we're finished?

58:15.880 --> 58:18.519
Who else knows about these
letters, Mr. Ritchie?

58:18.520 --> 58:24.250
Oh. Please don't call me by my real name.
It destroys the reality I'm creating.

58:24.400 --> 58:27.080
Who are the goddamn Germans?

58:27.680 --> 58:29.723
Time out.

58:30.880 --> 58:33.924
Uh, I hate to break out
of character, uh, but...

58:34.000 --> 58:37.124
you cannot shout
into a person's ear.

58:37.360 --> 58:39.085
It does damage.

58:39.280 --> 58:41.881
You know, the spitting
I don't mind.

58:42.640 --> 58:44.604
Boris, it's so big.

58:44.640 --> 58:46.888
- Boris. Please.
- Boris.

58:46.960 --> 58:49.479
Please. Not like
Ponsonby in Helsinki.

58:49.480 --> 58:52.923
Is fun for you, but we have
to clean up after. Please.

58:54.840 --> 58:57.599
- Yes.
- We do have to do cleanup after?

58:57.600 --> 59:00.007
Always. You're right.

59:02.280 --> 59:04.801
Sometimes it's foolish
to be so brave.

59:05.000 --> 59:06.839
You leave us no alternative.

59:06.840 --> 59:10.169
I will call Dr. Ludmilla Kropotkin.

59:10.640 --> 59:15.050
- She will take care of you.
- The evil lady torturer? Ha, ha.

59:15.080 --> 59:16.327
Bring her in here!

59:16.480 --> 59:20.639
Even perhaps you are not brave
enough for taste of her medicine.

59:20.640 --> 59:22.490
I'm not ticklish.

59:23.160 --> 59:25.647
- Get the rubber sheets.
- Yes, boss.

59:27.320 --> 59:28.679
And watch that man.

59:28.680 --> 59:30.166
Yes, boss.

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:08.047
Hey.

01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:10.169
How come you not sniff on his turn?

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:12.879
Boris' Old Spice is lingering.

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:16.239
Eeh. Do you think we could open
up the window a little bit?

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:20.605
Hey, vodka...

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:22.759
be a guy.

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:24.399
See that nasal spray?

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:27.649
Could you pass me over a couple
of snoots worth, please?

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:34.199
Is poison maybe.

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:37.847
Ah, good. Give him. Maybe
we'll finish game.

01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:45.808
I'm going to need one on each side.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.009
Tilt. Let me tilt.

01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:56.809
It's not sealed on right.

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:58.966
Deeper.

01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:02.599
Wait, stop. Stop.

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:05.326
Stop. Can you back it out a little?

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:08.171
Can you back...?

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:11.279
- No, don't do that. Stop.
- it's stuck.

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:14.324
Don't push it in. Stop it.
Don't push it in. Wait.

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:17.005
Gah! No.

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:19.005
Now it's too far in.

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:21.040
You squeeze it.

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:22.646
Wait, wait.

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.279
Squeeze it.

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:31.250
- Aah!
- Ugh.

01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:34.085
Mm. Better.

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:39.610
Fabulous. Fabulous.

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:43.290
You're clumsy. Heh, heh.

01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:45.159
What're you doing? Don't joke.

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:46.930
Great, great spill.

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:48.719
I still need my stuff though.

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:50.490
You stay, I'll get it.

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:56.359
Come on.

01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:58.079
Now really.

01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:02.759
I know you do this every night and it can
get boring, but you gotta give 100 percent.

01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:05.964
Now I've got to figure
out how to escape.

01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:09.963
I'm going to show you what
100 percent looks like.

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:12.651
I'm right there.

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:18.679
Where's that big paw of yours?

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:25.122
Lori, am I good, or am I good?

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.769
He's done it again.

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:31.088
My God, you're good.

01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:32.527
Thank you.

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:35.443
- Gonna untie me?
- Oh, yeah.

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:37.039
Ah. Sorry.

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:38.844
Hurry, before they come back.

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:41.965
Dr. Ludmilla...

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:44.324
we're ready for you now.

01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:58.319
Why do you always
go out the window?

01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:00.079
It's more dramatic, I guess.

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:02.959
It's kind of a Starsky and
Hutch thing, isn't it?

01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:04.919
Where's our special scarves?

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:07.088
Whoa! Aah!

01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:09.399
Stop joking.

01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:12.604
I risked my life. I waited
for you. I didn't have to.

01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:14.882
Why did you tonight?

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:17.444
Don't make me say it now.

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:19.399
What about the money?

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:21.921
We can't just rewrite the
whole script, can we?

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.406
Can't we?

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.089
Is the money so important?

01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:30.359
Oh. Without the money, what
the heck we got going on?

01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:32.722
Less than I thought, obviously.

01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:45.287
Bye.

01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:56.444
Albert, if you don't say it,
it won't work. What are you?

01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:58.239
I'm a very naughty boy.

01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:00.239
- Good.
- Oh!

01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:02.920
- What are you?
- I'm a very naughty boy.

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:04.441
Sorry.

01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:06.451
Don't mind me.

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:10.449
If you hold it a bit lower
down, you get more of a flick.

01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:11.960
Thank you.

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:16.799
What are you?

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:19.759
- A very naughty boy. Oh!
- Oh!

01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:21.639
If Featherstone Finch...

01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:25.287
were to move 40 million
of assets to, uh...

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:27.281
Tonga...

01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:32.166
Get your heads down!

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:34.084
Get your hands up!

01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:38.679
Look at the bloody floor. Get
your hands behind your back!

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:42.168
- Look at the floor.
- Where's Mr. Ritchie?

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.290
Where's Mr. Ritchie?

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:50.530
Where's Mr. Ritchie?

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:53.399
- Mr. Ritchie, he go for port.
- Which port?

01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:56.479
- I think she means...
- Shut up, you! Which port?

01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:58.250
He go for port in his car.

01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:00.879
Control.

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:04.562
Green 1. Suspect Ritchie heading
for unspecified port. Over.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.438
Control to Special Branch.

01:06:06.439 --> 01:06:10.440
I want an all-ports alert, effective
immediately. Close all ports.

01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:18.764
Jimmy! Jimmy, up!

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:21.479
- Wally?
- Up high!

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:24.968
I'm the only one standing
on a ledge! Jimmy!

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:27.608
- Oh, my God.
- I'm stuck!

01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:30.239
- Don't move!
- I won't! I can't!

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:32.199
I'm coming, Wally.

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:33.439
- I'm...
- All right.

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:34.687
Aah!

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:40.439
- Oh, no.
- Ugh.

01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:42.642
Come on, damn it. They're gone.

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:45.322
Here. Come here.

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:50.601
Ugh.

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:52.850
- Hold me.
- Okay.

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:57.809
We'll try from other side.

01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:00.079
Stop!

01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:02.319
- What happened?
- He went out the window.

01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:03.799
You have beans!

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:06.651
He jumped us. He's not human.

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:09.159
Neither am I.

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:11.408
- Get him!
- Yes, boss.

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:14.807
A nasty, wicked boy.

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:19.326
Jimmy. Jimmy.

01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:22.882
We get him from downstairs.

01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:35.211
Wally.

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:38.445
Wally.

01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:40.519
Jimmy.

01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:41.960
Where are you?

01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:44.999
I'm here on the ledge.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.440
What's going on, Wally?

01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:53.530
Jimmy, my... My leading lady came out on
the ledge, and I think I broke her heart.

01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:56.359
And... So I followed her.

01:07:56.360 --> 01:08:00.359
She came out here and she
went down to this next room.

01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:02.767
There's a hallway. We can walk.

01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:04.879
Yeah. Not very theatrical, though.

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:06.839
I'm so sorry. This isn't theater.

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:09.520
It's all right. You don't
get it. It's experimental.

01:08:09.521 --> 01:08:11.085
This is serious.

01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:12.999
It's very raw, very...

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.522
No, no, no, no.
It's real. It's so real.

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:18.519
Freeze!

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:23.158
Turn around! Put your hands
in the air! Get them up!

01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:27.081
Heh. I'm glad you came.
I think you're gonna like it.

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:41.246
You missed!

01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:44.999
You missed again! Heh.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.964
Not by much, though!

01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:52.004
Ow! Cut! Hold it!
Hold it. Time out.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.238
Time out!

01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:57.680
I got something in my eye, jag-off!

01:08:57.840 --> 01:08:59.484
Stop it! Oh, God!

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:03.203
Guys! Let's not forget my safety!

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:06.969
Oh! Aah!

01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:10.127
Aah! I'm flying!

01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.044
Oh, God, I'm gonna die.

01:09:20.359 --> 01:09:24.484
I guess I got the drop on
Dr. Ludmilla Kropotkin.

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:29.089
Get that thing away from that
little boy's butt! Drop it!

01:09:31.439 --> 01:09:34.006
- You all right, son?
- Yes, thanks.

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:37.483
for him, hour after hour I
just wait. Of course, he...

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:51.081
Yeah. I would like Lori's three
million pounds, please, or...

01:09:51.479 --> 01:09:54.046
Dr. Ludmilla Kropotkin will die.

01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:56.399
But I am Dr. Ludmilla Kropotkin.

01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:58.841
Keep back. He's dangerous.
He might have bomb.

01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:01.807
Okay. Plan B, then.

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:04.365
Lobby, please.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.521
I'll just get her letters
for her, then, huh?

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:13.886
Don't worry, even he cannot
penetrate ballroom for letters.

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:17.519
Help! I'm being abducted.
You've got to...

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:18.999
Oh, you're together.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.799
- He's the brother.
- Good. Take him to bowels of hotel.

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:23.684
I go after the brother.

01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:30.884
One false move and the doctor will
get a taste of her own medicine.

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:33.691
Relax, we're actors.

01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:39.479
Oh, please, I'm not a
doctor. I'm a manicurist.

01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:41.523
It's our anniversary.

01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:46.199
- Yeah, I'd like to believe that...
- Heh, heh.

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:50.086
from one of the most dangerous
women in the world.

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:54.525
I suppose you were involved with that
business in Helsinki with Ponsonby. Huh?

01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:58.159
Did you get your
kicks, doctor? Huh?

01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:00.399
We were just having a little fun.

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:02.921
Yeah. You had your fun.

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:07.251
And he got his head sent
home in a freezer bag.

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:16.085
The key is really to listen...

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:17.925
to feel it, and then...

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.599
- ...respond as if it were really happening.
- Right.

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:22.768
You can do it. Break a leg.

01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:26.684
Help, please! She's a killer!

01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:28.450
- Please.
- She's dead.

01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:29.966
What's wrong?

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:31.646
It's our anniversary.

01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:34.808
- We are kidding.
- We are only acting.

01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:37.885
- What?
- Just acting. Ha-ha-ha.

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:40.891
Oy, hold it right there.

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:44.725
- You can't go without a security pass.
- Russian Secret Service.

01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:46.525
I need to see your pass.

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:48.007
Happy now?

01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:28.569
Excuse me! Excuse me! Hello, hello.
Uh, no pass, no entry, I'm afraid.

01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:31.201
I'm looking for a tall American.

01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:35.367
Aren't we all, dear. But we've got a show
to put on, in case you didn't notice.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.531
Thank you.

01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:39.410
You can wait outside.

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:43.403
Can we have all these
swans together? Thank you.

01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:46.450
And you'd be
Mr. Nikolai, I presume.

01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:49.519
Would you get into the
rest of the costume?

01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:51.439
I'm not supposed to be in costume.

01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:54.325
- We are performing tonight, aren't we?
- Yeah...

01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:58.159
Then get with it! You go before
the public in two minutes.

01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:01.170
I'm not ready for that. My
brother said I wouldn't have...

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:03.482
Spare me the prima donna act.

01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:07.249
It's really not the time.

01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:10.922
Nikolai's come in from the cold,
everyone. On stage, please.

01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:14.879
We know you and your German friends
are financing whole operation.

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:16.119
Your brother told us.

01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:19.919
I'm a banker. I'm mortgaged to
the hilt. I can't finance anything.

01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:22.439
The longer you keep me
here, the less I'm worth.

01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:26.439
Let's have a little fun
with electricity, shall we?

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:28.324
- Oh!
- Ooh.

01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:32.679
My lords, ladies and gentlemen...

01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:37.119
the dancers from Russia
will perform a dance...

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:42.281
symbolizing man's growth
from infancy to adulthood.

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:40.127
Good God!

01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:45.365
Eh!

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:56.006
Where's Lori's letters?

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.559
Hey!

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:39.761
Hey!

01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:46.925
Hey! Hey. Hey, wait.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.248
- No.
- May I?

01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:32.531
Lori wants her letters back.

01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:38.399
Boris, come quickly.

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:42.889
Okay, I bring dart gun. Then
it's curtains for Spenser.

01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:16.729
Hey!

01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:23.639
Hey-yo! Hey!

01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:38.491
Whoa!

01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:40.359
Hey!

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:49.126
Spineless little shit.

01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:52.239
Ugh. I'm very late.

01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:55.319
I lost my ticket, but I'm a friend
of the minister of defense.

01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:58.842
Really? And my mom knows
the queen of Sheba.

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:01.764
Gilbert.

01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:05.039
Oh.

01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:08.130
Hello. Hello.

01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:10.279
- Uh...
- Ahem.

01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:14.439
Maybe we should get out while we can.
Perhaps he could bring money.

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:17.644
Here, get Rasputin's money now.

01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:24.164
Oh.

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:29.401
Psst.

01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:55.479
How can we tell which
doll is which?

01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:57.239
Only he can.

01:18:57.240 --> 01:18:58.646
That's his plan.

01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:02.719
He's open!

01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:03.919
Mm.

01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:05.485
Let's get out of here.

01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:14.639
Where're you guys going? Heh.

01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:18.239
Heh. Here comes Hawkins
with your money, now.

01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:21.759
Great. I wish my brother could be
here. He's missing everything.

01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:23.450
Here's the stuff.

01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:26.490
You idiot, go and get
the brother, now!

01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:31.520
Please don't go anywhere. I want to
talk to you both after the show.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.089
Oh, my God.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:03.799
Stop! Don't torture him,
or his brother will kill us all!

01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:26.891
Whoa.

01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:24.009
The man is a god.

01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:31.642
I finish this man to man.

01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:41.919
Aah!

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:43.804
He has disabled bomb.

01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:52.959
Hold it right there, you two.

01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:54.999
What did you think of the show?

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.959
Here's the cash. You
can count it all now.

01:21:57.960 --> 01:21:59.479
Thank you very much.

01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:01.799
Two bags worth. Whoa!

01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:04.480
Heh, heh. Whoa!

01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:07.845
Where's Lori? Do you know
if she saw the show?

01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:09.879
I got her money. She'll like that.

01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:13.163
- Love the hat.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:16.759
Can you keep a secret? I'm
taking this souvenir of my day.

01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:19.359
This has been a total hoot. Hey!

01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:22.279
I'm afraid he's a little
groggy, but he's fine.

01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:23.479
- Heh, heh.
- Wally.

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:25.319
Welcome back, stranger.

01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:27.159
Here, take a load off.

01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:29.319
- Can I get you some tea?
- Please.

01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:30.919
One lump or two?

01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:32.485
No lumps.

01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:35.279
What have you been doing?

01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:36.559
I was tortured.

01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:40.048
- Great. Did they make it fun?
- What?

01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:47.723
You know what they're signing?

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:52.363
The death knell of our dreams.

01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:55.483
We'll have to settle for half.

01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:56.887
Ready?

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:58.559
Ready.

01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:00.279
Did you see what I did?

01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:03.759
In front of all these
people, I had a solo.

01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:06.639
I had the entire crowd
eating out of my hand.

01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:08.799
Is that what you were wearing?

01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:10.650
Maybe they made a tape.

01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:12.841
I'm so proud of you.

01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:16.207
I want to be just like you, Wally.

01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:20.002
When I was back in that room,
I thought I was going to die.

01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:24.919
My life passed before my eyes and I
realized I cared about the wrong things.

01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:29.011
I've cared about money and
success and getting to the top.

01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:31.288
Prestige and...

01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:33.849
At the end of the day...

01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:36.809
There's a big guy
standing behind you.

01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:38.719
Yeah, well...

01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:42.083
maybe you'll feel better if
you could see this tape.

01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:47.679
Really behind me? Heh.

01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:49.159
You're everywhere.

01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:51.399
This one is for you...

01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:52.761
buddy.

01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:55.679
Bang. Ha, ha.

01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:57.119
Is joke.

01:23:57.120 --> 01:23:58.367
Look.

01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:00.165
"From KGB to Boris...

01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:03.126
fastest gun in the east."

01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:06.326
But there can only
be one fastest gun.

01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:08.170
And now, it's you.

01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:09.919
I salute you.

01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:15.001
Doreen and me, we go open butcher shop.
But you will always be my brother.

01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:30.529
Oh, look!

01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:40.201
What? What's the matter?

01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:43.479
There's nothing in
here but silly money.

01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:45.444
What were you looking for?

01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:48.481
- I lost my souvenir doll.
- Heh.

01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:54.010
You really don't care about
money at all, do you?

01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:56.844
It's not real.

01:24:56.960 --> 01:24:59.208
The doll was beautiful.

01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:03.762
How's this for a souvenir?

01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:16.284
<i>Roger, you don't
suppose maybe doll...?</i>

01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:20.162
Don't be daft. This is the
one he picked for himself.

01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:25.639
Ah. Terrible-looking thing. Her
stomach looks like her ass.

01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:29.049
Is her ass, you idiot.
Give it to me.

01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:34.167
There.

01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:45.041
That was like an explosion.

01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:47.404
- Want to try it again?
- Yes.

01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:50.090
Do you have insurance?

01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:56.759
Did you see this?
We were right there.

01:25:56.760 --> 01:25:58.610
We could've been killed.

01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:01.519
It says this mystery guy...

01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:06.601
was equal parts brilliant
cunning and sheer testosterone.

01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:09.726
They were right about
the second part.

01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:11.600
Time out.

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:21.039
All right, Venkman.

01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:22.651
Now.

01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:33.799
Compliments of the house.

01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:35.319
Oh, my gosh.

01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:37.204
You people are so nice.

01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:39.119
Uh...

01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:40.890
Do you eat the flower?

01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:51.924
I'm sorry. In the nose too.

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:54.607
- That's the worst. Here, get a towel.
- Ugh.

01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:57.162
- Ooh.
- Oh.

01:26:57.520 --> 01:26:59.131
- Did that make contact?
- Ugh.

01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:00.919
Oh, my gosh!

01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:02.959
Oh. Uh...

01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:08.199
<i>Gesundheit</i> myself.

01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:11.688
- You okay?
- Yeah, just another Old Spice guy.

01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:15.799
Impressive performance,
Mr. Spenser.

01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:18.239
Sorry about the test, but
we did have to be sure.

01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:22.719
Only one candidate in a thousand
even detects Amazonian frog toxin...

01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:24.919
much less incapacitates
the messenger.

01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:27.479
And it's rare that we even
approach a candidate...

01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:31.319
until we've auditioned him for 12 or
18 months, but the other night...

01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:34.205
We witnessed the birth
of a superstar.

01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:36.523
We'd like you to join the team.

01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:39.366
You want me to be a
part of the company?

01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:47.399
I don't know what to say. This
is all happening kind of fast.

01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:50.046
Just tell us your demands, please.

01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:56.166
What do I do?

01:27:56.800 --> 01:27:58.479
They think you're a superstar.

01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:01.001
I think they expect
you to act like one.

01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:09.279
I would like fresh flowers in
my room. Rare tropical flowers...

01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:10.759
that smell good.

01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:12.759
And ice in my dressing room...

01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:16.079
which should be a palace and
so should Lori's be a palace.

01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:20.080
And I want a dressing room
for my pet bloodhound too.

01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:21.559
And a poodle.

01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:25.319
And Lori's poodle. They
can bunk in together.

01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:29.002
But there better be fresh
flowers in there! And ice!

01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:32.399
- Whatever.
- Just so long as you produce the hits.

01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:34.639
- I'll do six a week.
- Six?

01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:35.839
Five.

01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:38.599
Mm-mm. No, not six. Five.

01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:41.007
But one of them will be for free.

01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:43.647
I want to do kids or old
people one day a week.

01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:48.399
And I want a StairMaster.

01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:50.519
I want a JuiceMaster.

01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:53.319
I want a ThighMaster and
I want a ButtMaster.

01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:56.524
If you can't give it to me,
I'm going back to Des Moines.

01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:00.288
Just don't hurt the help.

01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:02.330
It's whatever you want.

01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:05.679
I want this guy. He's fantastic.
I love working with him.

01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:08.759
I hope I've passed your audition.
Thank you for asking.

01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:10.279
Let's get creative.

01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:13.484
I'm thinking for our
opening season, Lori...

01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:15.359
as Juliet.

01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:17.119
Shakespeare in the Sand!

01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:20.479
You've got casting approval,
okay? For your lead.

01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:23.206
Joan of Arc for our action people.

01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:25.329
I set you afire.

01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:27.359
You behead him, right?

01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:29.050
Experimental.

01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:30.639
<i>Cats.</i>

01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:33.239
Wait a second! With people.

01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:35.999
People as cats. Let's workshop.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.479
Uh, you're both cats.

01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:40.679
You're my big cat. I've got
a giant cat. Get down.

01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:43.159
Creative producer.
Thank you. You're the dog.

01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:45.719
We've got a dog and a cat,
but they hate each other.

01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:47.490
Chase, chase.

01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:50.599
Go, go! Arf, arf, arf.
Cat, go, kitty, go!

01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:54.719
Lori and I are the husband and wife.
We have this cat and this dog.

01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:58.163
We love each of them, but
they hate each other.

01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:01.519
So you're the bad cat. The
only thing we can do is...

01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:04.564
Cut it out! Bad kitty! Bad cat!

01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:08.530
Is this working? Are you liking it?
