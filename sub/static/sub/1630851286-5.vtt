[melodic jazz music]

00:05.606 --> 00:10.511
Imagine...finding a message in a
bottle that's been floating at
sea for 50 years.

00:11.179 --> 00:12.980
And when you finally open that
bottle,

00:13.013 --> 00:15.849
you get a glimpse to the past,
untouched.

00:16.284 --> 00:18.652
It's like time stood still.

00:19.487 --> 00:23.824
Now in today's world, we
oversaturate ourselves with
messages and selfies and

00:23.857 --> 00:27.328
information. Nothin' is sacred
anymore.

00:28.696 --> 00:31.165
Why not save some of those
memories for your son's

00:31.199 --> 00:34.668
first day of college or you
and your wife's 20th
anniversary.

messages that can't be opened by
anyone

00:44.011 --> 00:47.315
including yourself, except for
who you designate,

00:47.715 --> 00:50.551
and on the day in the future,
you choose.

00:53.321 --> 00:54.955
[clapping accelerates]

00:54.988 --> 00:56.357
I'm sold.

00:56.890 --> 01:00.528
That was perfect, Omar. I don't
know how they can say no.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.630
Previous investors have said no,
Tyler.

01:02.663 --> 01:04.064
Those people are idiots.

01:04.498 --> 01:06.066
It's our time now.

01:07.668 --> 01:09.970
I'm gonna go get a coca-cola.
Want somethin'?

01:10.003 --> 01:12.173

01:12.906 --> 01:14.175
[Omar sighs]

01:15.176 --> 01:16.677
They can't say no.

Hello, Omar.

01:24.017 --> 01:25.386
Hey, how are you?

01:25.419 --> 01:28.156
- This humidity is messin' up my
$200 silk press,

01:28.189 --> 01:29.857
but other than that...

01:30.057 --> 01:31.058
great.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.194
Well, I been telling you you
should go natural.

01:33.227 --> 01:36.864
I didn't get my opinion when
you shaved your beard for our
wedding, did I?

01:36.897 --> 01:39.200
I just kept a big smile on my
face.

01:39.233 --> 01:42.035
Wait, wait, wait you, you didn't
like it?

01:42.069 --> 01:44.037
Yo, I was tryin' to clean up for
you.

01:44.071 --> 01:46.574
You know beards are makeup for
men,

01:46.607 --> 01:50.110
No warnin' or nothin'. Just
showed up with the butt face.

01:50.411 --> 01:53.013
[laughs] Alright, fine. I'll
stay in my lane.

01:53.046 --> 01:56.684
But I'm sure you did not call to
talk about my hair struggles.

01:56.717 --> 01:59.119
- I had the afternoon off and I
figured maybe I would

01:59.420 --> 02:01.855
come pick up Caleb and take him
to go see a movie.

02:02.390 --> 02:03.891
- Yeah, no.

02:03.924 --> 02:07.060
He got in a fight at school
today. He is grounded!

02:07.094 --> 02:08.396
Is he okay?

02:08.429 --> 02:09.663
Yeah, he's fine.

02:09.697 --> 02:12.900
Wants me to start callin' him
Caleb the knockout kid.

02:13.867 --> 02:14.735

02:16.136 --> 02:17.405

up and I'll talk to him about
it.

02:18.872 --> 02:21.742
You know it's probably best if
we wait until we go to court

02:21.775 --> 02:23.744
before you pick him up
unsupervised.

02:23.777 --> 02:25.213
It's only 2 weeks away.

02:27.548 --> 02:28.782
Alright, Naomi.

02:33.954 --> 02:37.057
If you wanna see him today, you
can stop by today around 3:00,

Mm, I don't really care. You
choose.

tank is on E before you fill it?

yourself to the hospital?

passengers from last night.

tell the teacher.

Right? Gave us decent bars and
restaurants to frequent to.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.909
Like we doin' right now.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.244
- So you'd rather have a
overpriced cocktail than

10:11.278 --> 10:13.580
than for folks to keep their
homes they've been in for
generations?

10:13.613 --> 10:16.549
Come on, man. The mayor's
approvin' all those changes.

10:16.583 --> 10:18.051
Come on, man. You voted for her.

10:18.085 --> 10:19.386
Greg doesn't vote.

10:19.419 --> 10:20.387
Really?

10:20.420 --> 10:21.421
Never have. Never will.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.255
- Mmhmm.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.758
Okay. Alright, I want the smoke.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.393
What's up, G?

10:26.426 --> 10:28.428
You know our whole system is
corrupt, right?

10:28.461 --> 10:29.897
My vote ain't gonna change a
damn thing.

10:29.930 --> 10:31.598
- [Jarvis] Naw, no, no,
no, no, no.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.566
Every vote counts!

10:33.600 --> 10:36.403
Huh? No, your ancestors died for
that right.

10:36.436 --> 10:39.072
Our ancestors died fighting for
freedom.

10:39.106 --> 10:40.573
And we still fightin' to this
day.

10:40.607 --> 10:42.275
To this day!

10:42.309 --> 10:44.444
Babe....ah, I got it.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.246
- Well...I was tryin' to help.
- Okay.

10:46.279 --> 10:48.749
Look, I refuse to legitimize

10:48.782 --> 10:49.917
an illegitimate system.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.919
- Mmhmm.
- I'm sorry, I just think that
that

10:51.952 --> 10:53.253
sounds like an excuse, Greg.

10:53.286 --> 10:55.088
- Mm hm.
- I mean if- if you really...

10:55.122 --> 10:57.090
- ...want to change, then you
need to be...
- Ooh [mocking laughter]

10:57.124 --> 10:58.258
a part of that change.

10:58.291 --> 10:59.960
- Yeah, you gotta be a part of
it.
- Right?

10:59.993 --> 11:00.627
Yes.

11:01.795 --> 11:02.696
Okay, that sounds like a line
from a Disney film but

11:02.730 --> 11:04.798
thank you. This is the real
world, Lisa.

11:04.832 --> 11:06.700
- Come on, Greg. Come on, man.

11:06.734 --> 11:08.468
You see what they're doin' with
the water boys out there.

11:08.501 --> 11:09.569
Gettin' rid of 'em.

11:09.602 --> 11:11.071
The man doesn't care about us.

11:11.104 --> 11:12.740
- Wait, what are water boys?

11:12.773 --> 11:14.641
Ah they gave 'em that name cause
they jump in traffic

11:14.674 --> 11:16.944
until you give 'em a $20 bill
for a water bottle.

11:17.244 --> 11:19.412
- Oh.
- Okay, so

11:19.446 --> 11:22.082
would you rather them be out
there robbing folks?

11:22.115 --> 11:24.484
Okay, uh is selling water
bottles

11:24.517 --> 11:26.586
or robbin' people the only two
choices?

11:26.619 --> 11:29.723
- I didn't--
- No, no. Is education not an
option anymore?

11:29.757 --> 11:30.991
This is why you don't try to

11:31.024 --> 11:32.425
reason with folks who voted for
Trump.

his politics...
- Okay?

11:38.598 --> 11:40.233
except the tax cut.

11:40.267 --> 11:41.334
You know me, Greg.

11:41.368 --> 11:44.071
Wow! That makes it better.

11:44.104 --> 11:45.272
[melodic Hip-Hop music]

11:45.305 --> 11:48.208

Hey.

12:06.726 --> 12:07.895
What's this?

12:09.396 --> 12:13.300
Well, all you had was rice and
leftover chicken so I made you
my famous

12:16.069 --> 12:18.906

my fridge.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.243
- Mm, oh my god.

12:23.811 --> 12:25.312
I know this movie!

12:25.345 --> 12:29.049
It's the um, The Angry River.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.018
Yes, how- how did you know?

12:31.985 --> 12:34.822
Well, growing up in DR, we only
had like two channels.

12:34.855 --> 12:38.191
And classic kung fu movies
played on one of them.

- Mm.

12:57.677 --> 12:58.745
It's right there in the kitchen.

No, I'm eating this for

Keith?

13:09.356 --> 13:11.758

Smith?

this--
- Okay, you've got jokes.

13:17.764 --> 13:19.766
- No, you know it's
- Okay.

13:20.033 --> 13:23.837
it's just the fact that you're
not thirsty.

13:23.871 --> 13:25.105
Some of these guys,

13:25.873 --> 13:28.075
they see me posting sexy
pictures on Instagram and
they just

13:28.108 --> 13:30.677
think I'm going to the highest
bidder but

13:30.710 --> 13:32.779

that?

13:32.812 --> 13:34.014

- [TV] What do you want?...

13:34.047 --> 13:35.682
You wanna have these clothes
back?

13:35.715 --> 13:37.784

- I do.

13:38.051 --> 13:39.419

- Wait.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.129
- Here, take a seat.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.131
- Okay.
- Now, um...

13:51.464 --> 13:52.966
it's just a little something,
okay.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.434
Well I love little somethings.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.536

blow up my favorite.

I'm glad you like it, Um...

- Aw man.
- ...I mean it's yours of
course, but um

14:41.781 --> 14:43.650
I'm hoping you'll let me borrow
it

14:43.683 --> 14:46.419
when I eventually showcase it in
my photo gallery.

14:46.453 --> 14:48.621
I mean with your permission, of
course.

14:48.956 --> 14:50.157
A gallery?

14:50.190 --> 14:53.293
Like...I'm gonna be in a
gallery?!

14:53.526 --> 14:55.295
That's the plan. [chuckles]

14:55.628 --> 14:59.332
Oh my god. I mean Instagram is
nice but

14:59.366 --> 15:01.634
a gallery, like... me?

15:01.668 --> 15:02.769

15:02.802 --> 15:04.771
That's just like next level. My
family,

15:04.804 --> 15:06.706
they're gonna be so proud of me.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.309
- A look well, eh it's not a
huge gallery, okay.

15:09.342 --> 15:10.944
It's just a start up, but um

15:10.978 --> 15:13.646
you know I got a perfect
location and

15:13.680 --> 15:15.815
it just takes time. And um

15:16.183 --> 15:17.317
money.

15:17.350 --> 15:20.187
[sighs] It...doesn't matter.

15:21.721 --> 15:24.824
I came to this country to work
and send money back home because

15:24.857 --> 15:26.526
they don't have much and

15:26.559 --> 15:29.296
if they see me like this in a
gallery,

15:29.329 --> 15:31.564
well it just means that I'm
doing something right.

15:40.173 --> 15:41.508
- Okay.

15:51.751 --> 15:52.819
What is this?

15:52.852 --> 15:55.255
It's the money I owe you for the
photo shoot.

15:56.189 --> 15:58.591
I hope it helps get things
going.

16:00.360 --> 16:03.463
Yeah. [laughs] It will.

19:14.587 --> 19:17.224
I also said that I needed to
pray about it.
* You're wrong

19:17.257 --> 19:19.626
- Yeah well [scoffs] pray to god
or to
* Whoa

19:19.659 --> 19:20.560
* Baby I

19:20.593 --> 19:22.562
Pastor CashApp?
* Could apologize

19:22.595 --> 19:24.631
Pastor Millsap
* For the way I said what I

19:24.664 --> 19:26.165
raised me
* Did

19:26.499 --> 19:28.501
and married us.
* And maybe I

19:28.835 --> 19:30.737
He is still our marriage
counselor
* I was selfish baby

19:30.770 --> 19:32.472
even though you decided not to
go anymore.
* Couldn't help it, baby

19:32.505 --> 19:35.174
He's your marriage counselor,
not mine.
* Felt helpless, baby, yeah

19:35.508 --> 19:37.310
He always takes your side.
* Truth be told, I don't wanna

19:37.344 --> 19:40.313
Maybe I'm always right.
* Leave, but I gotta do

19:40.347 --> 19:41.814
Alright, well fine. You know
what?
* What's best for me

19:41.848 --> 19:42.915
I guess I'll just get in line

19:42.949 --> 19:44.150
like everybody else.
* 'Cause my heart

19:44.183 --> 19:45.818
- Omar, it's not always about
you.
* Breaks in pieces

19:45.852 --> 19:47.420
* Over you

19:47.454 --> 19:49.155
Sometimes you gotta sacrifice
your little

19:49.188 --> 19:51.157
feelings for the good of your
family.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.325
[Amber Riley sings]
* You

19:52.359 --> 19:53.826
So you can lead by example
* Act like I ain't got no

19:53.860 --> 19:55.328
for our son.
* Feelings

19:55.362 --> 19:57.930
Look I'm sorry, Naomi. I
thought I sacrificed enough
* Well I'm a mess

19:57.964 --> 20:00.433
when I lost my tech job because
of that parking lot incident.

20:00.467 --> 20:01.768
Well maybe you need to
* You act like I can't tell

20:01.801 --> 20:03.836
learn how to control your
temper.
* The difference

20:03.870 --> 20:06.373
[Omar sighs]
* It's just regret

20:06.706 --> 20:08.341
You should be thanking me, Omar
* Yeah

20:08.375 --> 20:09.842
- ...for picking up the
* You waited till there's no

20:09.876 --> 20:12.111
- ...slack and taking care of
our family.
* Connection

20:12.144 --> 20:14.180
It's not always about the money,
Naomi.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.782
* Oh whoa

20:15.815 --> 20:17.450
You know I grew up thinkin'
that,
* To act like I ain't

20:17.484 --> 20:19.185
until I realized
* Got no feelin's

20:19.218 --> 20:22.522
it is all about the money.
* Yeah I'm a mess

20:22.555 --> 20:23.956
Everything we do-
* [Dixon and Riley vocalizing]

20:23.990 --> 20:26.859
me, you, our marriage, it's all
to build a better life.
* Baby I could

20:26.893 --> 20:27.960
* Apologize

20:27.994 --> 20:29.796
- And I'm gonna be damn sure
* For the way I

20:29.829 --> 20:31.864
our son never has to go without
* Said what I did

20:31.898 --> 20:33.032
* Yeah

20:33.065 --> 20:35.868
* And maybe I, I was selfish,
baby.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.370
* You were selfish, baby
* Couldn't help it

20:37.404 --> 20:39.806
I'm not your competition.
* Baby, felt helpless, baby

20:39.839 --> 20:41.140
* Yeah

20:41.173 --> 20:42.309
You don't have to fight me on
everything.
* Truth be told,

20:42.342 --> 20:44.977
* I don't wanna leave
* You don't wanna leave

20:45.011 --> 20:46.646
* But I gotta do

20:46.679 --> 20:48.715
It's funny how when I don't
submit, you see it as a fight.
* What's best for me

20:48.748 --> 20:52.919
Submit? Submit...heh.
* Ooh...my heart is breaking in
pieces over

20:53.252 --> 20:54.554
We should be able to work this
out
* 'Cause my heart it

20:54.587 --> 20:55.888
on our own.
* Breaks in pieces

20:55.922 --> 20:58.858
* Over...you

20:59.592 --> 21:02.161
I don't want some old white man
in a courtroom

21:02.194 --> 21:04.163
tellin' me when I can and cannot

21:04.196 --> 21:06.833
see my own son, Naomi.
* Ooh

21:06.866 --> 21:08.335
* [vocalizing]

21:08.368 --> 21:09.669
* You

21:09.702 --> 21:11.037
Me either.

21:11.738 --> 21:13.172
* Over

21:13.205 --> 21:16.376
That's why my lawyer is pushin'
for a Black woman judge instead.
* You

21:16.409 --> 21:19.278
* You

21:19.879 --> 21:21.548
I'll see you in court, Omar.
* Over

21:21.781 --> 21:24.183
* You

21:24.216 --> 21:26.619
* [vocalizing]

21:26.886 --> 21:28.220
[door creaks]

21:29.422 --> 21:30.690
[creaking]

21:30.723 --> 21:33.460
* You act like I ain't got no
feelings

21:34.394 --> 21:36.062
* Girl, I'm a mess.

21:36.729 --> 21:38.064
[thunder roars]

21:38.431 --> 21:41.067
* You act like all these other

21:42.234 --> 21:44.704
* Makes me upset
[rain falling]

21:44.737 --> 21:46.105
* [vocalizing]

21:46.138 --> 21:50.042
* But when you hurt me, I can
feel it

21:50.076 --> 21:53.646
* All in my, chest
