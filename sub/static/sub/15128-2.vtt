00:00.737 --> 00:02.890
<i>People have died, God damn you.</i>

00:02.899 --> 00:06.133
<i>It's Whitechapel.
They die every day.</i>

00:06.135 --> 00:08.556
55 lives given up

00:08.557 --> 00:13.719
<i>for $350,000 in unregistered
and anonymous bearer bonds.</i>

00:13.720 --> 00:16.137
I imagine a man of my calling
might find some purpose here.

00:16.138 --> 00:18.112
See he gets what he needs.

00:18.114 --> 00:19.825
You are come home?

00:20.150 --> 00:21.461
This

00:22.195 --> 00:26.451
is bad money. We may take
it and ennoble its purpose.

00:26.452 --> 00:27.878
You were recruited.
By who?

00:27.880 --> 00:30.080
We were chosen for one skill or another.

00:30.082 --> 00:32.049
These men who now await their earnings,

00:32.051 --> 00:34.485
-they've not seen you, you are sure?
-Certain.

00:34.487 --> 00:35.499
He looked wrong,

00:35.500 --> 00:38.295
like a village parson got
off at the wrong station.

00:38.391 --> 00:40.057
<i>Polished his shoes too bright.</i>

00:40.994 --> 00:42.666
Your name again, sir?

00:42.667 --> 00:43.566
Capshaw.

01:50.518 --> 01:51.261
Morning.

01:53.549 --> 01:54.867
Clara!

01:58.759 --> 02:01.026
Clara, my love.

02:01.028 --> 02:01.812
Clara?

02:06.241 --> 02:07.559
Anyone, my love?

02:07.930 --> 02:09.684
Not at all.

02:11.717 --> 02:14.858
Well there's a, there's
a few scraps here that...

02:15.372 --> 02:18.221
-we could...
-Horace.

02:23.090 --> 02:25.218
There's nothing left.

02:34.258 --> 02:36.451
Good morrow, and welcome you both

02:36.452 --> 02:37.933
to our house of curiosities.

02:37.935 --> 02:39.201
May I perhaps interest you...

02:39.203 --> 02:41.637
Mr. Buckley, please...

02:42.880 --> 02:44.487
desist.

02:45.410 --> 02:47.977
My name is Mr. Capshaw,

02:47.979 --> 02:50.461
and I represent the
interest of your creditor.

02:50.462 --> 02:52.148
We have time yet to pay, sir.

02:52.150 --> 02:54.850
And one day would, no
doubt, make every difference.

02:54.852 --> 02:58.587
Your current position with interest.

03:02.250 --> 03:04.927
Mr. Capshaw, Clara's father was...

03:04.929 --> 03:07.819
dreadful train accident, you
see, and with the funeral costs,

03:07.820 --> 03:10.439
-we have so little that...
-Are you able to settle?

03:12.570 --> 03:14.403
I thought not.

03:14.405 --> 03:15.971
And yet you continue to rebuff

03:15.973 --> 03:18.174
the wholly reasonable
offer of your creditor.

03:18.176 --> 03:19.408
This shop is my livelihood.

03:19.410 --> 03:20.613
These four walls are my home.

03:20.614 --> 03:22.745
I... I cannot give it to you.

03:22.747 --> 03:24.080
I will not.

03:24.082 --> 03:25.489
I expected as much.

03:25.490 --> 03:27.714
Henceforth, I shall be
passing your debt forth

03:27.715 --> 03:28.984
to this gentleman.

03:28.986 --> 03:30.686
His name is Mr. Kendrick.

03:30.688 --> 03:33.222
I suspect you may find
his terms less amenable.

03:35.010 --> 03:36.788
Horace...

03:38.338 --> 03:40.744
Gander at this shite.

03:49.433 --> 03:52.234
Small wonder you can't
make ends meet.

03:53.946 --> 03:55.145
Well, now...

04:00.010 --> 04:02.570
Let's take a look, shall we?

04:25.536 --> 04:27.769
Is this where the
treasures are kept?

04:27.771 --> 04:29.138
There's nothing in there.

04:29.140 --> 04:31.073
Please, Mr. Capshaw,
I beg of you.

04:31.462 --> 04:32.661
Open it.

04:33.798 --> 04:36.879
Get away from there.
How dare you!

04:36.881 --> 04:39.448
How dare you threaten and bully and force!

04:39.449 --> 04:41.083
Clara! Forgive her, sirs.

04:41.085 --> 04:42.651
A woman's grief.

04:42.653 --> 04:44.219
You and your cursed company.

04:44.221 --> 04:47.156
Smiling your liar's smiles for all to see

04:47.158 --> 04:50.559
while you devour our
homes, our shops.

04:50.561 --> 04:52.361
Your smile is a wolf's maw,

04:52.363 --> 04:55.063
and we shall not submit
to you as every other has.

04:55.065 --> 04:56.431
Submit, madam?

04:58.135 --> 05:00.269
They simply paid their dues.

05:03.807 --> 05:05.307
If you please.

05:06.577 --> 05:08.076
Get off! Get off me!

05:08.078 --> 05:10.928
Get off! No!

05:10.982 --> 05:13.616
No! Get off!

05:23.470 --> 05:25.203
You see, there's nothing.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.038
Tell me, Horace.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.474
Is this where the treasures are kept?

05:42.476 --> 05:44.049
Get away from there!

05:46.446 --> 05:47.634
Clara.

05:47.916 --> 05:49.430
Clara!

05:50.091 --> 05:52.447
Clara.

05:52.497 --> 05:55.591
Clara, my love. God.

05:55.716 --> 05:57.749
You did this.

05:59.638 --> 06:02.372
She fell. Mr. Buckley.

06:04.391 --> 06:06.425
You killed her!

06:06.427 --> 06:07.993
Go!

06:09.809 --> 06:11.363
Come back here!

06:36.255 --> 06:41.724
" Come unto these yellow sands "

06:42.375 --> 06:45.391
" And then take hands "

06:45.730 --> 06:48.831
" Curtsied... "

07:57.976 --> 08:01.051
She's hit, falls.

08:01.809 --> 08:03.327
Fractured cranium, maybe.

08:03.459 --> 08:05.995
They say the Buckleys
never traded a cross word.

08:05.996 --> 08:07.385
Well, if it weren't a domestic,

08:07.386 --> 08:08.752
slim pickings for an hold-up.

08:08.754 --> 08:10.620
-They were in debt.
-Who to?

08:10.622 --> 08:12.322
Only the figures.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.080
Borrowing and borrowing.

08:14.083 --> 08:16.950
Clawed themselves from under, and only
bringing more down upon themselves.

08:16.951 --> 08:18.128
They were buried alive.

08:18.130 --> 08:20.312
Peaceful couples have broke peace for less.

08:42.921 --> 08:46.990
Policing together again, Mr. Drake.

08:46.992 --> 08:48.558
Coppering thus.

08:48.560 --> 08:50.847
Circumstances aside, it's
something I've missed.

08:51.897 --> 08:54.872
Your abilities will always
be welcome at "H" Division.

08:56.311 --> 08:58.245
Alongside your own, sir.

08:58.246 --> 08:59.871
I am not meant for the yard, Inspector.

08:59.872 --> 09:03.239
I, afraid Abberline may
have a bent for that politic,

09:03.240 --> 09:05.653
but I... you and I are Whitechapel,

09:06.128 --> 09:07.777
and I intend to remain so.

09:10.260 --> 09:13.249
Then long may we copper thus, Mr. Reid.

09:18.948 --> 09:22.108
Barely open two weeks
and see the work we do.

09:22.884 --> 09:24.565
Dr. Frayn?

09:25.854 --> 09:27.414
Might I...

09:28.109 --> 09:30.465
My dear friend, Miss Erskine.

09:30.716 --> 09:34.219
-Doctor. A pleasure.
-Miss Erskine.

09:34.339 --> 09:37.134
You bring a flush of
celebrity to our clinic.

09:37.762 --> 09:41.529
Miss Erskine's very visit here today will
help spread word of your work, Doctor.

09:41.530 --> 09:44.150
And I should be in your
debt. Hope you'll excuse me.

09:44.270 --> 09:45.807
Of course.

09:46.068 --> 09:50.170
Doctor Frayn is a recent graduate
of the School of Medicine for Women.

09:50.205 --> 09:52.420
-I never knew such a place.
-No.

09:52.540 --> 09:55.460
-But I would make the likes of it here.
-You...

09:55.733 --> 09:58.451
-take in students?
-I do.

09:59.035 --> 10:01.874
Think of the girls in this borough Rose,

10:01.994 --> 10:04.874
the best they might hope for, the best

10:04.994 --> 10:07.542
is to climb their way to
sweatshops or scullery,

10:07.562 --> 10:09.556
but here they might learn nursing,

10:09.576 --> 10:12.384
or if able enough become
doctors themselves.

10:12.670 --> 10:15.390
Doctor Frayn is a paragon of that hope.

10:15.415 --> 10:19.427
Doctors, Rose. Not match
girls nor market traders...

10:19.453 --> 10:20.455
Nor whores.

10:21.063 --> 10:23.510
-Nor that.
-Miss Susan?

10:23.630 --> 10:25.895
Mr. Capshaw requests you, Miss.

10:31.649 --> 10:34.215
Screaming blue murder, she was.

10:36.628 --> 10:38.761
She was hysterical.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.797
She was imprisoned in a cellar.

10:40.799 --> 10:42.386
Such terror, she fainted.

10:42.387 --> 10:44.667
Give me room. My god.

10:44.669 --> 10:47.837
It was a... a child's dungeon.

11:01.125 --> 11:02.652
All right, soldier?

11:03.478 --> 11:05.778
Keeping you busy, are they?

11:06.124 --> 11:07.690
Inspectors!

11:07.692 --> 11:10.360
<i>Perhaps you might spare a
moment for The Star?</i>

11:10.362 --> 11:12.929
Indulge our inquiries concerning
the locomotive tragedy.

11:12.931 --> 11:14.063
Sirs!

11:14.065 --> 11:16.332
Will you not afford me a modest audience?

11:16.334 --> 11:17.867
-Not now, man.
-No?

11:17.869 --> 11:20.088
For what right of the people of Whitechapel

11:20.089 --> 11:23.741
to understand why 55 now
lie beneath the earth?

11:24.366 --> 11:26.290
Why you send marionettes to the rope

11:26.291 --> 11:27.977
while a puppeteer wiles in shadow?

11:27.979 --> 11:30.713
Unless the truth be that
Edmund Reid cannot say

11:30.715 --> 11:32.415
because he does not know?

11:32.440 --> 11:35.726
Unless the truth be that a crime
of such measure requires a lawman

11:35.758 --> 11:38.276
-of greater measure.
-Enough.

11:38.278 --> 11:40.971
Inspector Drake, is this not
why you returned to Whitechapel?

11:41.306 --> 11:45.348
A new broom to replace one bare of
bristles and borne hither on the very train

11:45.349 --> 11:47.813
which murdered scores on his watch.

11:48.310 --> 11:51.771
You think me a preening cockerel
but rather a cockerel than a capon.

11:51.772 --> 11:53.881
They will know justice.

11:54.001 --> 11:55.710
Any found with blood on their hands

11:55.711 --> 11:58.193
from that black day will know justice, but

11:58.195 --> 12:00.529
this morning, a woman
lies slain in her shop,

12:00.531 --> 12:02.965
and it is to that we presently attend.

12:02.967 --> 12:04.900
Our work has not ended.

12:04.902 --> 12:06.935
You, Mr. Best...
you are not alone

12:06.937 --> 12:09.138
in losing one you loved to that train.

12:09.859 --> 12:11.993
Of course you know. Of course.

12:12.285 --> 12:17.027
But is not Whitechapel's Copper-in-Chief
also these days it's File Clerk-in-Chief?

12:17.700 --> 12:18.899
Allow me to assist

12:18.901 --> 12:21.967
with the distracting
business of Clara Buckley.

12:22.217 --> 12:25.038
It is her, I assume the dead woman.

12:26.103 --> 12:28.571
Kendrick, the collector, come for his dues.

12:28.572 --> 12:29.738
Kendrick?

12:30.746 --> 12:33.247
Kendrick killed Clara
Buckley, you saw this?

12:33.249 --> 12:35.141
A reporter of mine saw Horace Buckley

12:35.142 --> 12:37.150
running for his life, Kendrick after him,

12:37.636 --> 12:39.486
wild as a dog.

12:41.742 --> 12:45.638
The Buckleys were decent people. So I hear.

12:46.352 --> 12:51.708
Let's hope our tireless policemen
are able to afford them, some justice.

12:56.411 --> 12:57.848
She will sleep.

12:58.274 --> 13:00.911
I gave her laudanum for her terrors.

13:01.378 --> 13:02.276
Her condition?

13:02.278 --> 13:04.170
Malnourished, though no more so

13:04.171 --> 13:06.014
than any other child of this quarter.

13:06.016 --> 13:07.382
Perhaps less than most.

13:08.188 --> 13:09.684
Was she raped?

13:09.686 --> 13:12.086
No. Of that, I'm sure.

13:12.088 --> 13:14.889
The child's been cared for.

13:14.891 --> 13:17.331
The only harm upon her,
there is scarring.

13:17.332 --> 13:18.459
Her back.

13:18.461 --> 13:19.827
She was beaten?

13:19.828 --> 13:21.129
No, burned.

13:21.397 --> 13:23.097
From some years past.

13:23.099 --> 13:26.467
Mr. Capshaw says the
Buckleys were childless.

13:26.469 --> 13:27.969
Who is she?

13:27.971 --> 13:32.173
Alice, she says, though
her faculties are...

13:32.175 --> 13:35.479
Miss Hart, my concern would be
more for the health of her mind

13:35.480 --> 13:36.411
than her body.

13:36.413 --> 13:38.780
-She howls to be returned.
-Where?

13:38.782 --> 13:42.417
To the Buckleys, to
home, but she says "pupa."

13:42.419 --> 13:43.912
I believe she means her chamber.

13:43.913 --> 13:48.656
The girl was... she
was not their captive.

13:48.658 --> 13:50.691
She is confused and afraid.

13:50.693 --> 13:52.927
That is all I can
presently say for certain.

13:52.929 --> 13:55.930
She seems to fear
everything but the Buckleys.

13:55.932 --> 13:58.032
Dr. Frayn, the welfare of this girl

13:58.034 --> 13:59.801
is to be your chief concern.

13:59.803 --> 14:01.035
Is that understood?

14:01.037 --> 14:03.504
Miss Hart, for what greater purpose

14:03.506 --> 14:06.741
my schooling and our
clinic, than one so in need?

14:23.426 --> 14:24.959
This man, Buckley?

14:24.961 --> 14:28.096
Kendrick lost sight
of him in the rookery.

14:28.098 --> 14:30.398
He'll be found.

14:30.400 --> 14:33.036
Buckley shall not speak
of what took place.

14:33.037 --> 14:34.782
You believe that to
be the matter critical?

14:34.783 --> 14:37.731
It is nevertheless a
matter of consequence...

14:38.975 --> 14:41.409
And he shall be found.

14:41.411 --> 14:44.112
Whatever the truth of this,

14:44.114 --> 14:47.515
the girl regards the
Buckleys as parents.

14:47.517 --> 14:48.683
Already this morning,

14:48.685 --> 14:50.651
the Buckley woman
lies dead by your hand,

14:50.653 --> 14:53.321
and I will not have the girl made orphan.

14:53.323 --> 14:57.091
Find Horace Buckley
and bring him to me.

15:06.170 --> 15:08.395
Clyde Kendrick.

15:09.855 --> 15:11.787
What have I won?

15:13.732 --> 15:15.517
Horace and Clara Buckley.

15:15.518 --> 15:17.700
You collected rent from them this morning.

15:19.204 --> 15:20.670
The Buckleys?

15:20.672 --> 15:22.972
Mrs. Buckley's dead, Mr. Kendrick.

15:22.974 --> 15:24.974
-I think you know that.
-How would I know that?

15:24.976 --> 15:28.079
-You were seen.
-You're mistook.

15:28.455 --> 15:30.892
I've been sat at the
desk all this morning.

15:31.017 --> 15:33.149
Why not ask my dear wife?

15:33.151 --> 15:36.286
Ain't that so, Gertie?

15:41.165 --> 15:43.827
The Buckleys.

15:43.829 --> 15:45.662
Yes.

15:45.664 --> 15:47.070
New business.

15:47.139 --> 15:48.580
Due to visit them Friday.

15:48.581 --> 15:51.101
You are a frequent caller
in these parts, are you not?

15:51.103 --> 15:52.883
There's a lot of
debt in these parts.

15:52.884 --> 15:54.204
And vultures will circle.

15:54.206 --> 15:56.606
I'm not a shylock, gentlemen.

15:56.608 --> 15:58.208
-You do not lend.
-Certainly not.

15:58.210 --> 15:59.209
Then who does?

15:59.211 --> 16:00.810
My clients are various.

16:00.812 --> 16:02.112
The Buckleys!

16:02.114 --> 16:03.996
Which client?

16:03.997 --> 16:07.851
If there isn't a crime you wish
to charge me with, Inspector,

16:08.797 --> 16:11.521
I'm a working man with business to attend.

16:11.523 --> 16:13.040
Now, you wait a bloody moment.

16:25.144 --> 16:27.078
Obsidian Estates.

16:27.080 --> 16:28.146
The signature.

16:28.148 --> 16:30.275
-Ronald Capshaw.
-The lawyer.

16:30.276 --> 16:32.483
Susan Hart's lawyer.

16:33.688 --> 16:35.113
How much business do you take

16:35.114 --> 16:37.687
from Ronald Capshaw
and Obsidian Estates?

16:37.807 --> 16:40.525
A new client, so I believe.

16:40.878 --> 16:43.566
Ain't it so, Gertie?

16:46.027 --> 16:49.670
I very much doubt you will be
recovering this debt, Mr. Kendrick.

16:55.511 --> 16:57.035
You imagine Susan Hart

16:57.036 --> 16:59.886
complicit in Obsidian
Estates practicing usury?

17:00.254 --> 17:02.326
The long Susan I knew
was a mistress of whores,

17:02.327 --> 17:03.488
but a woman of decency.

17:03.489 --> 17:06.348
I can't speak for the
Susan Hart to whom I return.

17:06.406 --> 17:09.611
Even so. Capshaw's mark on this paper.

17:09.612 --> 17:11.411
There is a stench around this man.

17:11.412 --> 17:14.018
The reek of him drifts
amid the blood and smoke

17:14.019 --> 17:15.277
of the robbed train.

17:15.594 --> 17:19.047
Be that as it may, so
far as Clara Buckley goes,

17:19.049 --> 17:21.137
if Kendrick ain't a moneylender,

17:21.137 --> 17:23.037
he may yet well be a murderer,

17:23.038 --> 17:25.579
and we'll need more than
Fred Best crying bogeyman

17:25.580 --> 17:26.480
to prove such.

17:26.481 --> 17:27.911
We find Horace Buckley.

17:27.912 --> 17:29.758
Only he can say what happened in that shop.

17:30.331 --> 17:32.118
Not only he, Mr. Reid.

17:32.343 --> 17:34.563
Clara Buckley may yet speak to us.

17:34.925 --> 17:38.086
But it is neither you nor I
who have the learning to listen.

17:38.087 --> 17:41.695
Not the American. Anyone but the American.

17:46.683 --> 17:49.834
The Prairie Rose.

17:52.019 --> 17:54.234
You really want my opinion?

17:55.231 --> 17:56.887
The God's honest, hand on heart,

17:56.888 --> 17:58.196
sound two cents?

17:58.250 --> 18:02.107
As surprising as it may seems, your
thoughts are of qualified value.

18:02.922 --> 18:04.694
All right.

18:05.892 --> 18:08.127
It is the...

18:08.379 --> 18:10.647
lowest form of reeking word swill...

18:10.648 --> 18:12.724
It's pandering, confected
trivial horse shit,

18:12.725 --> 18:15.684
that ain't an ounce of human truth
through the whole God foresaken story.

18:16.710 --> 18:17.894
You're a cynic.

18:18.240 --> 18:20.648
-And a charlatan.
-Who told you?

18:22.114 --> 18:25.416
I'll be sure to share
your constructive analysis.

18:25.948 --> 18:29.213
And, if you wish to continue
treating this playhouse

18:29.215 --> 18:31.883
as your flophouse,
you'll collect me at 7:00

18:31.885 --> 18:35.119
then feed me with roast meat,
ply me with cheap liquor,

18:35.121 --> 18:37.722
and defile me in abject and merciless ways.

18:45.331 --> 18:47.590
Hey, darling. What's wrong?

18:47.710 --> 18:49.785
Your glittering find, brother.

18:49.826 --> 18:52.013
he thinks it'll pack the
house and make a fortune.

18:52.064 --> 18:53.425
Splendid!

18:53.843 --> 18:55.959
Perhaps it's one for you darling?

18:57.433 --> 18:58.310
Darling?

18:58.430 --> 19:00.916
You're a little early
for a matinee, gentleman.

19:00.951 --> 19:03.403
The clown we seek cavorts
everywhere but the stage.

19:06.475 --> 19:09.063
Bennet... Inspector Drake,

19:09.064 --> 19:11.278
Inspector Reid, may I
present Mr. Edgar Morton.

19:12.438 --> 19:14.448
Proprietor of BlewettÃ¢Â€Â™s and...

19:15.306 --> 19:18.919
And I'm proud to say
Miss Erskine's intended.

19:21.316 --> 19:23.096
Congratulations, sir.

19:23.221 --> 19:26.726
She is... Miss Erskine is...

19:27.698 --> 19:28.730
you're very lucky.

19:32.100 --> 19:33.400
Is he here?

19:45.257 --> 19:48.181
Straighten your wits, Captain.

19:48.182 --> 19:49.903
I was trying.

19:49.922 --> 19:53.186
They say if the doctor is
not to be found in his rooms,

19:53.188 --> 19:56.289
he broods these days at
the pavilion of varieties.

19:56.291 --> 19:58.399
From the body physic to the dreaming mind,

19:58.455 --> 20:00.680
truly, Whitechapel's very own Da Vinci.

20:00.718 --> 20:02.829
Well, even God takes a day of rest, Reid,

20:02.831 --> 20:05.398
but then again I guess you
don't believe in either of us.

20:06.768 --> 20:08.468
We've need of your services.

20:08.570 --> 20:10.262
<i>You might. He doesn't.</i>

20:10.263 --> 20:13.179
-Whatever may have passed between you...
-Whatever may have passed?

20:14.175 --> 20:17.106
You mean Dolly Do-right here
didn't give you a blow-by-blow?

20:17.107 --> 20:19.779
-You helped before.
-To civic emergency, Benito.

20:19.781 --> 20:22.893
Why don't you just come back next
time a train plows off the rails?

20:25.888 --> 20:27.020
We've come to you

20:27.022 --> 20:29.389
because we know of no
other with your skill.

20:29.391 --> 20:31.158
There will be client commensurate.

20:31.260 --> 20:32.759
Commensurate?

20:32.760 --> 20:35.062
For a degenerate unfit to serve the law?

20:35.063 --> 20:37.564
No man is fit to work from
the bottom of a bottle.

20:37.566 --> 20:39.496
My wife walked out on me, God damn it.

20:39.497 --> 20:41.627
I'd have thought you
understood the hole that tears.

20:41.628 --> 20:43.196
There was work needful of you.

20:43.197 --> 20:45.703
And if there's one thing
the three of us excel at,

20:45.704 --> 20:48.609
is it not to fail whatever
is most needful of us.

20:48.611 --> 20:50.266
Wasting our time here.

20:51.242 --> 20:52.508
Drake.

20:55.145 --> 20:57.238
No other with my skill?

20:58.077 --> 20:59.817
Well, I don't need your goddamn money,

20:59.818 --> 21:02.222
and I don't need you blowing
smoke up my ass, neither,

21:02.224 --> 21:03.857
but I want to hear it from him.

21:06.028 --> 21:07.995
I know that I'm shitty at a lot of things.

21:07.997 --> 21:09.897
In fact, most everything, but your work?

21:09.899 --> 21:12.161
Sniffing out a trail of
dead? Well, God help me.

21:12.162 --> 21:14.768
That's something I've
got a holy talent for,

21:15.380 --> 21:16.823
and I'm gonna hear you say it.

21:21.106 --> 21:22.998
-Jackson...
-I wanna hear him say

21:23.018 --> 21:24.609
that at bottle down I'm still better

21:24.610 --> 21:26.845
than any damn forensicator he can name.

21:26.972 --> 21:28.505
I want to hear him say

21:28.507 --> 21:31.408
that I'm not a piss-streaked,
scutter shoe shit.

21:31.410 --> 21:34.311
That I ain't some honey-chasing gutter rat

21:34.313 --> 21:35.978
with a heart of scorched turd.

21:35.979 --> 21:37.781
That's right, Reid.

21:37.783 --> 21:40.108
I remember every word, every goddamn rock

21:40.109 --> 21:42.733
that you threw at me
from your polished pulpit.

21:42.734 --> 21:45.483
I could have used a friend, not
a one-man temperance movement.

21:45.484 --> 21:48.683
I am a decorated United States
army captain and a doctor,

21:48.684 --> 21:51.661
and I wanna hear this
stuffed-shirt son of a bitch say it.

21:56.435 --> 22:01.633
You are not a piss-streaked...

22:04.476 --> 22:09.475
with a... of scorched turd.

22:09.476 --> 22:14.517
You... you are a doctor.

22:18.957 --> 22:21.858
I figured that's as
good as it was gonna get.

22:22.767 --> 22:24.194
All right.

22:29.047 --> 22:31.725
Seven sharp, darlin', and,

22:32.289 --> 22:34.307
put your hair pretty.

22:41.669 --> 22:44.638
Happy days are here to stay?

22:50.945 --> 22:53.780
Frontal fracture, orbital margin,

22:53.782 --> 22:56.282
punched, full fist.

22:56.284 --> 22:58.907
-Kendrick wear a ring?
-Not that I saw.

22:58.908 --> 23:00.233
Well, whoever hit her does.

23:00.289 --> 23:02.789
This incision here, index finger maybe.

23:02.791 --> 23:04.090
Husband?

23:04.092 --> 23:05.205
Remains abroad.

23:05.206 --> 23:07.648
By all accounts, violence
is most uncharacteristic.

23:07.649 --> 23:09.796
Well, maybe there was
someone else there, then.

23:09.798 --> 23:11.515
We need Jackson at the Buckley shop.

23:11.516 --> 23:14.567
Yeah, well, maybe Jackson's
got affairs of his own.

23:20.738 --> 23:22.141
Was she holding onto something?

23:22.142 --> 23:24.965
There's lesions on her palm,
and her nail beds are torn.

23:24.967 --> 23:26.079
Nurse, tweezers.

23:34.620 --> 23:37.423
No glare, no grimace, no "Shut up, yankee"?

23:40.195 --> 23:42.395
I'm gonna have to shoot him.

23:42.397 --> 23:43.763
What is it, man?

23:43.765 --> 23:45.898
It's a splinter.

23:45.900 --> 23:47.600
Varnished wood.

23:48.970 --> 23:51.964
There's bruising on her arms,
fractures of the metacarpal.

23:52.126 --> 23:54.574
She was grabbed hard and
dragged from something.

23:55.582 --> 23:57.810
They have anything worth
gripping that tight?

24:09.557 --> 24:12.024
Okay, she's hit.

24:12.026 --> 24:13.726
Bang.

24:15.896 --> 24:18.630
Yes, we got that much, Jackson.

24:25.279 --> 24:26.940
Is this Buckley some kind of mudlark?

24:26.941 --> 24:28.673
Maybe you check down by the river.

24:29.223 --> 24:30.868
It's a bloody long river.

24:31.744 --> 24:33.043
This.

24:34.018 --> 24:35.909
This... she was gripping this.

25:04.134 --> 25:05.747
Jesus.

25:39.113 --> 25:40.479
What is this place?

25:41.752 --> 25:43.252
Who was kept here?

25:44.855 --> 25:47.055
Buckley must have a workshop.

25:47.057 --> 25:48.557
This wood's salvaged.

25:48.559 --> 25:50.158
Needs to be dried and treated.

25:50.160 --> 25:51.895
And he builds, cuts.

25:51.896 --> 25:54.663
A man needs tools for
that, a space to work.

25:54.665 --> 25:57.499
That box upstairs...
that's fresh river pickings.

25:57.501 --> 26:00.593
I once saw you inspect that
like you was reading tea leaves.

26:00.594 --> 26:02.170
Try it on.

26:03.394 --> 26:04.437
And this?

26:04.640 --> 26:05.841
Butterfly wings?

26:05.843 --> 26:09.211
But the patterning, on
each one it's the same.

26:09.580 --> 26:11.013
Catching the same breed.

26:11.015 --> 26:13.855
Nothing about this is right, Reid. Nothing.

26:14.021 --> 26:16.727
From the candles and the food, the
room was inhabited until morning.

26:16.755 --> 26:19.189
Girl... fair, given the brush.

26:20.291 --> 26:23.503
The clothes, I don't know,
10 or 13, but you see here...

26:24.128 --> 26:27.863
They've been darned over
and over, made bigger.

26:28.218 --> 26:29.684
As she grew.

26:29.685 --> 26:31.110
So she's been here... who knows?

26:31.291 --> 26:32.567
Years.

26:34.917 --> 26:36.160
And there's this.

26:36.161 --> 26:38.573
You see these? Scratches and scuff marks.

26:38.575 --> 26:40.075
There was a struggle by the door.

26:40.077 --> 26:41.109
Fighting to get out.

26:41.111 --> 26:42.210
No.

26:42.749 --> 26:43.779
That's the thing.

26:43.780 --> 26:45.647
These are her marks, but the impact.

26:45.649 --> 26:48.016
She wasn't fighting to get out.

26:49.944 --> 26:51.777
She was fighting to stay in.

26:51.778 --> 26:53.188
Fighting who?

26:53.190 --> 26:55.707
Best said Buckley and
Kendrick ran from the shop.

26:55.708 --> 26:58.093
So, either Kendrick came back...

26:58.095 --> 27:00.332
Or there's your third man.

27:00.333 --> 27:03.520
Mr. Kendrick has not
afforded us full candor.

27:05.035 --> 27:09.097
I want Horace Buckley found.

27:16.787 --> 27:18.187
Alice.

27:19.430 --> 27:21.192
Good girl.

27:23.971 --> 27:25.657
It's all right.

27:26.135 --> 27:27.626
Good girl.

27:31.045 --> 27:32.721
Please take me back.

27:33.652 --> 27:36.670
To my pupa. Please, please.

27:36.853 --> 27:38.213
No!

27:38.215 --> 27:39.615
My wings!

27:39.617 --> 27:41.950
The wicked king will take my wings again!

27:41.952 --> 27:43.685
I must be in my pupa!

27:43.687 --> 27:44.920
Daddy!

27:44.922 --> 27:47.155
My mom... I can't... my wings...

27:47.157 --> 27:49.193
they won't grow. They won't open...

27:49.194 --> 27:51.744
I can't...

28:04.394 --> 28:07.109
And when she wakes, what then?

28:07.111 --> 28:09.645
I will not have the girl doped.

28:09.647 --> 28:13.115
There must be more we
can do than stupefy her.

28:13.117 --> 28:15.750
There is a new thinking on the continent.

28:15.785 --> 28:18.750
I attended lectures in Paris and Geneva.

28:18.870 --> 28:21.737
This man, Breuer, calls
it the cathartic method.

28:21.739 --> 28:23.472
A therapy for the mind...

28:23.474 --> 28:25.970
of the parts of the mind, beneath the mind,

28:25.971 --> 28:27.215
you might say.

28:27.240 --> 28:29.677
With your permission, Miss Hart,

28:29.777 --> 28:32.831
I should like to assay these
new techniques on Alice.

28:34.699 --> 28:36.465
And you believe it will help her?

28:36.467 --> 28:37.900
I do.

28:39.937 --> 28:41.801
Then proceed.

28:45.737 --> 28:47.258
You there...

28:47.559 --> 28:50.086
I... I me... I mean no harm now...

28:50.206 --> 28:52.287
There's coin here, for an errand...

28:52.288 --> 28:56.399
Did you ever hear, old stories
of brave knights and dragons?

28:56.463 --> 28:59.439
Hey... now... I've need of
a brave knight to carry...

28:59.459 --> 29:01.834
precious word upon this scroll.

29:04.332 --> 29:07.030
A princess depends on you.

29:22.542 --> 29:25.922
Mr. Kendrick thought it best
to take a prolonged sabbatical.

29:25.923 --> 29:28.732
Glasgow, I believe.

29:28.734 --> 29:30.234
And Mr. Buckley...

29:30.236 --> 29:32.088
Mr. Buckley has sent a proposal.

29:32.089 --> 29:35.644
Offers all he has in the world, chief
interest being the deed to his premises,

29:35.645 --> 29:38.308
and his lifelong silence
in exchange for the girl,

29:38.310 --> 29:40.545
with whom he shall leave
our fair city on the morrow,

29:40.546 --> 29:42.953
never to darken our alleys again.

29:44.483 --> 29:45.749
Your response?

29:46.543 --> 29:48.479
As you'd expect from a reasonable fellow,

29:48.480 --> 29:49.787
I agreed to every term.

29:50.299 --> 29:53.608
And tomorrow, at Buckley's
nominated time and place,

29:53.609 --> 29:55.355
I shall have a man meet him...

29:59.436 --> 30:04.764
and as per your
wishes, bring him to you.

30:05.462 --> 30:08.095
My wish is to know the
truth about the girl.

30:08.290 --> 30:10.225
Do you understand me, Ronald?

30:11.301 --> 30:12.831
What man...

30:14.412 --> 30:17.281
Who would keep a child thus?

30:18.052 --> 30:20.487
The truth, madam, shall be dragged forth.

30:23.531 --> 30:26.632
By its very throat, if need be.

30:30.237 --> 30:33.338
More of Buckley's wares, Captain.

30:56.292 --> 31:01.244
All these goddamn bugs
just look like... bugs.

31:05.501 --> 31:07.416
-Keep that cooking.
-Sir?

31:07.417 --> 31:08.611
Going to the zoo.

31:13.950 --> 31:15.255
The map, Inspector.

31:15.263 --> 31:18.017
All properties owned by
Obsedian Estates, sir.

31:18.066 --> 31:20.643
I had the constables go door to
door and wired the land registry.

31:20.659 --> 31:22.909
-Everything you wanted.
-Thank you, Sergeant.

31:34.712 --> 31:37.140
She has acquired whole
swaths of Whitechapel.

31:37.141 --> 31:40.601
Shop, cottage, tenant, here, here, here.

31:40.602 --> 31:42.690
These entire streets, all of this,

31:42.752 --> 31:45.352
expansion of Obsidian Estates portfolio.

31:45.565 --> 31:47.470
Defaulting debtors like the Buckleys

31:47.471 --> 31:48.868
forced to forfeit all they own.

31:49.335 --> 31:50.635
And the likes of Kendrick

31:50.636 --> 31:53.641
no more than blunt tools
to gouge out a foul empire.

31:53.736 --> 31:56.958
I believe it's time I
took tea with Miss Hart.

32:09.572 --> 32:11.263
Follow me, sir.

32:19.523 --> 32:21.393
Inspector.

32:22.562 --> 32:25.096
What a rare pleasure.

32:25.998 --> 32:28.253
But I sense little joy on your part.

32:28.254 --> 32:30.301
Your time is appreciated, Miss Hart.

32:38.075 --> 32:40.407
What might I help you with?

32:40.457 --> 32:42.316
A woman, Clara Buckley,

32:42.317 --> 32:44.673
was killed in Whitechapel this morning.

32:44.674 --> 32:47.534
A debt collector, Clyde
Kendrick, implicated.

32:47.535 --> 32:48.820
Are these names known to you?

32:49.747 --> 32:51.017
They are not.

32:51.104 --> 32:53.825
Perhaps to you, then, Mr. Capshaw...

32:54.647 --> 32:56.766
Given Kendrick acquired the Buckley debt

32:56.767 --> 32:58.697
from Obsidian Estates

32:58.832 --> 33:00.579
with your mark.

33:01.134 --> 33:02.801
There.

33:09.921 --> 33:12.665
On occasion, it is more profitable

33:12.666 --> 33:16.738
to offer a debt to market
than to pursue it fruitlessly.

33:16.775 --> 33:20.852
But if this man, Kendrick,

33:20.853 --> 33:23.274
has involved himself in an ugly episode,

33:23.275 --> 33:27.924
it is to my shame and regret
our company associated thus.

33:33.165 --> 33:35.300
Shame and regret?

33:38.371 --> 33:42.907
Buckley's ledgers show
interest inflated, week on week.

33:42.909 --> 33:45.746
Loan to pay loan to pay
loan, and the debt accrued.

33:45.747 --> 33:49.662
Not to Kendrick, but to Obsidian Estates.

33:50.417 --> 33:52.728
Such dealings with this
company are, I gather,

33:52.729 --> 33:54.116
not unique hereabout,

33:54.117 --> 33:59.424
so how fair's your regret
and shame, Mr. Capshaw?

33:59.426 --> 34:02.607
And yours, Miss Hart?

34:02.963 --> 34:05.494
Were I to posit that Obsidian Estates

34:05.495 --> 34:08.110
lends purely as a mechanism

34:08.112 --> 34:12.612
by which it may bully,
extort, and finally acquire?

34:12.772 --> 34:15.179
There's no coercion, Inspector Reid.

34:15.179 --> 34:17.148
It's merely legal transaction.

34:17.476 --> 34:19.587
Perhaps you find the trade distasteful,

34:19.588 --> 34:23.156
but the day of righteous distaste
is grounds for prosecution,

34:23.157 --> 34:25.063
this borough shall see
its jails burst asunder

34:25.063 --> 34:27.018
and its streets bare of life.

34:27.174 --> 34:31.389
That's an impressive ring,
Mr. Capshaw. Looks very solid.

34:33.243 --> 34:35.005
No doubt you have a whole cabinet of

34:35.034 --> 34:37.833
metallurgic studies in your famous archive.

34:37.846 --> 34:41.025
I shall look into every detail
of this matter, Inspector.

34:41.315 --> 34:42.348
Myself.

34:42.350 --> 34:44.350
You know me to be a woman of my word.

34:44.351 --> 34:46.226
And yet, every word I
hear today, Miss Hart,

34:46.226 --> 34:48.954
seems to ooze from the
mouth of Mr. Capshaw.

34:48.956 --> 34:52.291
Mr. Capshaw? Perhaps
now you might excuse us.

35:10.711 --> 35:13.011
Inspector, my project has ever been

35:13.013 --> 35:15.914
to make of Oobsidian
Estates an engine of good,

35:15.916 --> 35:17.850
to bring with it prosperity and hope

35:17.852 --> 35:19.885
to streets which have never known such.

35:20.887 --> 35:22.864
This company must obtain property

35:22.865 --> 35:24.557
if it is to shape this borough

35:24.559 --> 35:26.979
for the future its people deserve.

35:28.546 --> 35:32.831
But I have never and will
never tolerate illegality

35:32.833 --> 35:34.975
in the pursuit of that future.

35:37.928 --> 35:39.881
And your Mr. Capshaw?

35:43.010 --> 35:45.210
What is he prepared to tolerate?

36:06.359 --> 36:07.758
Jackson needs more time.

36:08.120 --> 36:10.627
His filtrations, he says.

36:11.102 --> 36:13.130
Kendrick is missing.

36:13.132 --> 36:14.975
Buckley is missing.

36:15.468 --> 36:19.136
The girl he kept in his
cellar for years is missing.

36:19.138 --> 36:22.639
We are being played for
fools by this Capshaw.

36:22.641 --> 36:26.495
And here, these streets.

36:27.465 --> 36:29.880
The streets we vow to protect,

36:29.882 --> 36:34.485
these people to whom we
promise safety and order.

36:34.487 --> 36:37.025
Susan Hart crows of her
good work for these streets,

36:37.056 --> 36:39.831
but at what cost to them a new Whitechapel?

36:39.832 --> 36:42.776
People extorted from their homes,

36:42.875 --> 36:45.796
terrorized by debt collectors.

36:47.585 --> 36:50.653
And these streets belong
to Obsidian Estates.

36:50.654 --> 36:52.202
What is our promise worth?

36:52.204 --> 36:55.172
Do we police for them?

36:55.174 --> 36:57.473
I used to argue with a man

36:57.604 --> 37:01.245
who believed chaos was the natural state.

37:01.247 --> 37:04.615
All things doomed to fall apart.

37:04.617 --> 37:08.180
A fissure splitting wider, day by day

37:09.463 --> 37:13.963
Set to swallow with a gossamer
dream that we make of order.

37:14.234 --> 37:16.610
I argued with him, yet, but...

37:17.244 --> 37:21.401
Now I feel the gossamer fray, Bennet.

37:21.947 --> 37:24.715
I feel the fissure yawn into abyss

37:24.716 --> 37:26.883
faster than we can weave afresh.

37:27.499 --> 37:29.253
Mr. Reid.

37:29.255 --> 37:33.056
You used to tell me our
work... that order...

37:33.653 --> 37:37.528
was a fight without end,
but a battle worth the blood.

37:38.764 --> 37:40.745
You believed that.

37:41.400 --> 37:43.333
And I believe it still.

37:45.004 --> 37:48.363
And so we weave on... thread by thread.

37:49.571 --> 37:53.039
And we hold the promise we have made.

37:54.676 --> 37:57.343
Ronald Capshaw thinks to tell us

37:57.345 --> 38:00.699
what he may undertake in
Whitechapel within the law,

38:00.745 --> 38:03.933
then we shall show him likewise.

38:06.521 --> 38:08.554
Five weeks past, you will recall,

38:08.556 --> 38:12.102
we foiled a snidesman who sought
to pass his paper hereabouts.

38:12.271 --> 38:14.210
Counterfeit money, as you see.

38:14.978 --> 38:18.860
Slick, like a scum of oil on our streets.

38:18.916 --> 38:21.568
There is reason to believe
some remains in circulation.

38:22.162 --> 38:26.067
Now, these hostelries here,
all owned by Obsidian Estates,

38:26.068 --> 38:28.298
and all to the blowers of whisper,

38:28.299 --> 38:31.260
all given to the conducting
of business illicit.

38:31.261 --> 38:33.191
Now, constables, it falls to you this night

38:33.192 --> 38:35.718
to see that these premises know our law.

38:35.987 --> 38:39.719
You will show them what it is
to be policed in this borough.

38:39.730 --> 38:41.781
Inspect every licence for licquor,

38:41.805 --> 38:44.534
gambling, look upon their
patrons, and turn out

38:44.560 --> 38:47.060
each and every pocket
that you deem needful.

38:47.201 --> 38:49.738
Do not spare your billy clubs.

38:49.994 --> 38:51.503
Go! Now!

38:51.747 --> 38:53.429
Police!

39:01.962 --> 39:03.867
We should play a game Alice.

39:04.216 --> 39:05.565
Would you like that?

39:05.997 --> 39:07.689
A lovely game?

39:09.079 --> 39:11.705
Will you close your eyes for me, please?

39:13.628 --> 39:15.870
And imagine a garden.

39:16.487 --> 39:20.242
Beautiful garden just for you.

39:20.483 --> 39:23.592
Where you're safe and happy.

39:23.594 --> 39:26.595
And look, a butterfly.

39:26.597 --> 39:30.999
The most beautiful
butterfly you've ever seen.

39:31.001 --> 39:34.545
And I want you to watch her drift and soar.

39:34.665 --> 39:40.927
Just watch the lovely
flow, beating of her wings.

40:04.242 --> 40:07.524
Inspector, I wonder if
we might talk a moment?

40:16.433 --> 40:20.297
The Greeks believed that the dead

40:20.298 --> 40:23.110
drank from the waters of the River Lethe.

40:23.111 --> 40:25.824
"Lethe" is forgetfulness.

40:25.826 --> 40:29.149
Flowing through the underworld
into the cave of Hypnos,

40:29.957 --> 40:34.066
and in so doing, they forgot
forever their waking selves.

40:34.068 --> 40:38.504
Thus, the superstition that it ill
becomes he who toasts with water.

40:51.082 --> 40:52.915
Sir...

40:52.917 --> 40:55.918
All these years policing
together hereabouts,

40:56.287 --> 40:59.788
there were times when we
had to go further than we...

40:59.790 --> 41:02.491
well, than the law allowed.

41:03.258 --> 41:05.239
Mr. Reid, tonight,

41:05.241 --> 41:08.645
what you told those men, what
they are now carrying out,

41:08.646 --> 41:12.413
rousting legitimate
businesses and innocent people?

41:12.830 --> 41:16.502
There's no talk of snide in
them places, sir, you know that.

41:17.197 --> 41:21.053
There's no narcs or snitches
giving us reason to storm the gates.

41:21.415 --> 41:25.342
What you asked of them,
that ain't policing.

41:26.987 --> 41:29.528
I must offer my gratitude
that you come back

41:29.529 --> 41:31.692
after four years to teach me how to police.

41:37.628 --> 41:41.063
When Fred Abberline asked my return here,

41:41.065 --> 41:42.798
there was talk of...

41:42.800 --> 41:45.555
that Inspector Reid had made of his desk

41:45.556 --> 41:47.603
and his office a bunker.

41:47.605 --> 41:51.073
Patrolled these days his
archives, not his streets.

41:51.820 --> 41:53.709
But what I saw this night

41:53.711 --> 41:56.965
was the Inspector Reid I
saw some four years past

41:56.966 --> 41:58.747
at the ropes of a fighting ring...

41:58.941 --> 42:01.650
A man driven by rage.

42:04.155 --> 42:06.622
And when I left this city,

42:06.624 --> 42:09.280
when I failed you as a friend,

42:09.430 --> 42:12.692
I did so only that I
might survive as a man.

42:12.693 --> 42:15.593
You do not need to
justify yourself, Bennet.

42:15.920 --> 42:19.168
It's not my own peace
which concerns me, sir.

42:21.272 --> 42:25.270
We battle monsters, we become monsters.

42:25.783 --> 42:28.773
In that abyss, which you speak of...

42:29.186 --> 42:31.733
it's not only around us...

42:32.095 --> 42:35.689
it's not only out there, it is inside us...

42:36.857 --> 42:40.330
and it bleeds a blackness
that swallows all light.

42:44.010 --> 42:49.454
I am, as I ever have been, friend to you.

42:50.016 --> 42:52.182
That is why I came.

42:52.486 --> 42:55.477
That is why I say what must be said...

42:56.925 --> 42:59.169
'Cause this borough needs us.

42:59.536 --> 43:02.044
It needs you, Mr. Reid...

43:02.168 --> 43:04.926
And for you to abide by the law.

43:06.899 --> 43:09.284
Do you imagine Horace Buckley

43:09.715 --> 43:13.265
endured a battle with himself day by day

43:13.473 --> 43:16.874
to keep a girl locked in his cellar?

43:19.187 --> 43:23.548
Or is there a true nature
to ourselves, Bennet?

43:25.086 --> 43:31.426
Is the truth that the abyss is
not within us, nor without us?

43:32.940 --> 43:35.991
We are the abyss.

43:40.775 --> 43:43.176
I appreciate your visit.

43:43.435 --> 43:44.901
Till morning.

43:45.870 --> 43:48.744
-Inspector Reid, sir.
-Good night, Bennet.

43:55.180 --> 43:57.046
Till the morning, then.

44:00.885 --> 44:02.987
I was his prisoner.

44:04.269 --> 44:08.584
The wicked king, he made me his prisoner.

44:11.135 --> 44:13.759
And he made me forget.

44:14.099 --> 44:15.698
Forget what?

44:16.029 --> 44:17.800
Who I am.

44:17.802 --> 44:20.036
And who is that, Alice?

44:20.038 --> 44:23.206
A princess of the faren.

44:23.208 --> 44:24.740
Faring?

44:25.144 --> 44:27.076
Farings?

44:27.078 --> 44:29.479
The winged ones.

44:31.282 --> 44:33.749
My daddy helped me to remember myself.

44:34.218 --> 44:35.952
Your daddy, Mr. Horace?

44:35.954 --> 44:38.454
After the sprites brought me to him,

44:38.456 --> 44:40.616
and he made my pupa,

44:40.651 --> 44:43.426
and he taught me about the wicked king.

44:47.031 --> 44:48.987
But I...

44:51.769 --> 44:54.036
I knew the king's secret.

44:56.107 --> 44:58.881
I knew why he became sad.

44:59.511 --> 45:00.640
Sad?

45:01.165 --> 45:02.656
Why?

45:03.948 --> 45:06.682
He was...

45:06.684 --> 45:09.498
hurting them.

45:14.120 --> 45:16.287
I can see.

45:17.958 --> 45:20.074
The king is so sad.

45:20.827 --> 45:23.795
So I go into his throne
room to sing to him,

45:23.797 --> 45:25.430
but he is gone, and I...

45:27.400 --> 45:29.300
I see.

45:31.471 --> 45:33.104
What do you see, Alice?

45:34.470 --> 45:36.435
Pictures.

45:39.506 --> 45:44.009
I find pictures of them all hurt and...

45:44.011 --> 45:45.510
Who?

45:45.512 --> 45:47.140
Who are they?

45:49.683 --> 45:51.249
Dead fairies.

45:53.553 --> 45:56.721
I am in his room of terrible secrets,

45:57.399 --> 46:03.111
and he... the wicked king... punishes me.

46:03.113 --> 46:06.064
How does he punish you?

46:06.460 --> 46:09.434
He takes me on his ship.

46:11.104 --> 46:15.710
The water, all glitter in the sun, and

46:16.276 --> 46:18.660
so bright.

46:18.979 --> 46:20.478
And then...

46:20.931 --> 46:22.647
Then what?

46:23.131 --> 46:24.249
Alice?

46:24.251 --> 46:25.850
Fire.

46:27.020 --> 46:29.187
Fire.

46:29.269 --> 46:31.503
My punishment.

46:33.093 --> 46:35.011
I am burning.

46:38.011 --> 46:41.813
The wicked king wants to burn me

46:41.815 --> 46:43.729
so my wings will never grow back,

46:43.730 --> 46:45.717
and I will never fly away.

46:48.107 --> 46:49.687
It hurts.

46:50.301 --> 46:53.091
It hurts so much.

46:53.093 --> 46:54.726
Alice.

46:54.728 --> 46:58.296
Can you tell me what the king looks like?

46:59.238 --> 47:01.521
A man...

47:02.502 --> 47:04.519
On fire.

47:06.239 --> 47:11.509
<i>He screams my name, but not my name.</i>

47:12.091 --> 47:14.312
What name does he scream?

47:14.314 --> 47:17.682
He is... he is crying.

47:19.185 --> 47:21.919
And I'm falling.

47:22.016 --> 47:23.415
Falling.

47:25.091 --> 47:30.695
The king reaches for me,
and now the sprites have me.

47:30.697 --> 47:32.797
The sprites?

47:32.799 --> 47:35.433
The river sprites have me.

47:35.959 --> 47:37.869
And they carry me,

47:38.778 --> 47:43.409
and their arms are so cold
on my back, and then...

47:43.965 --> 47:49.414
"Come unto these yellow sands"

47:49.856 --> 47:53.885
"And then take hands"

47:54.429 --> 47:59.566
"And, sweet sprites, bear the burden"

48:02.358 --> 48:04.984
And my daddy, Horace, finds me.

48:05.927 --> 48:07.353
Mr. Buckley.

48:08.790 --> 48:11.858
And he tells me, my true name.

48:13.237 --> 48:15.183
And the truth of who I am.

48:30.083 --> 48:31.550
Alice.

48:32.034 --> 48:34.583
Alice, can you look at something for me?

48:34.959 --> 48:37.003
Can you look at this picture?

48:37.742 --> 48:38.571
No!

48:39.117 --> 48:40.248
No!

48:40.741 --> 48:43.708
What is it? What is it, Alice?

48:44.945 --> 48:47.178
The wicked king!

48:49.616 --> 48:51.483
You're safe now, Alice.

48:51.485 --> 48:53.318
You're safe now.

48:53.823 --> 48:57.956
Safe and sound. Safe and sound.

49:02.890 --> 49:05.306
He requests audience, sir.

49:06.154 --> 49:08.085
Tell him to get out of
my police station before I

49:08.086 --> 49:10.553
have two constables assist
him without delicacy.

49:10.773 --> 49:13.571
What I have to say warrants
your good ear, Inspector.

49:16.551 --> 49:17.890
May I?

49:19.098 --> 49:20.930
Thank you, Sergeant.

49:25.421 --> 49:28.403
Two trains mangled, dozens dead,

49:28.405 --> 49:30.372
five men hanged for what?

49:30.374 --> 49:33.876
A robbery, yes, but naught claimed amiss.

49:33.878 --> 49:35.878
Strange days, would you not agree?

49:35.880 --> 49:37.946
If you come to berate
my investigation afresh,

49:37.948 --> 49:39.741
I shall shackle you for a month.

49:39.742 --> 49:41.201
Your investigation, indeed.

49:41.202 --> 49:43.218
Poked your snout 'round
the goods yard, I hear,

49:43.220 --> 49:44.568
but truffled thus in vain

49:44.569 --> 49:47.031
because no stevedore
wished to implicate himself

49:47.032 --> 49:48.962
to a copper in acts illegal.

49:48.963 --> 49:50.069
What acts?

49:50.544 --> 49:55.234
Levying what one might call
an unofficial handler's fee.

49:55.269 --> 49:55.993
They skim.

49:55.994 --> 49:57.800
Some with rigorous efficiency,

49:57.802 --> 50:00.736
which is why they
remarked upon the sea cans.

50:01.063 --> 50:03.338
The sea can what was robbed.

50:03.750 --> 50:07.075
Hoboken, New Jersey to Whitechapel, London,

50:07.077 --> 50:09.545
and for a year now, month on month,

50:09.547 --> 50:13.382
sea cans just like it arriving
on the same shipping ticket.

50:13.384 --> 50:14.867
Locked up like a safe.

50:14.869 --> 50:16.612
No dice, thus, for our skimmers,

50:16.613 --> 50:20.342
except one time the sea
can was damaged in transit.

50:20.349 --> 50:22.052
Locks smashed, doors warped.

50:22.053 --> 50:24.801
The stevedores, well,
they're giddy for a peek,

50:24.802 --> 50:26.584
and what do they find?

50:27.052 --> 50:28.510
Carpetbags.

50:28.528 --> 50:32.401
A few bloody carpetbags filled with...

50:32.403 --> 50:34.903
well, they call it "money
that weren't money."

50:34.904 --> 50:37.005
Not good old readies, Inspector.

50:37.007 --> 50:40.384
This was paper marked "bearer bonds."

50:40.734 --> 50:43.111
In United States dollars.

50:44.519 --> 50:48.269
Bonds? That's what it was all for?

50:48.270 --> 50:50.227
Bags stuffed, Inspector.

50:50.228 --> 50:55.224
Picture and count
hundreds of thousands gone

50:55.664 --> 50:57.659
and unreported. Why?

50:58.083 --> 50:59.294
You intend to print this?

50:59.577 --> 51:01.419
What, and blow a trombone

51:01.420 --> 51:04.032
to startle those behind it,
give them cause to scamper?

51:04.034 --> 51:06.672
No, sir. I shall continue
to inquire on the hush

51:06.673 --> 51:08.537
and now, so may you.

51:09.640 --> 51:11.807
And you seek what in return for this?

51:12.910 --> 51:16.166
You think me a muckraker, a peeping Tom,

51:16.167 --> 51:18.513
a sniff at the knicker
drawers of this town.

51:18.515 --> 51:19.895
But I...

51:24.021 --> 51:28.510
You are aware a friend of mine perished

51:28.641 --> 51:30.771
for the greed of those bloody bonds.

51:30.772 --> 51:33.729
I will not fail him as I once...

51:35.666 --> 51:37.500
What do I seek?

51:37.501 --> 51:40.551
I seek justice done in
Whitechapel, Inspector Reid.

51:40.552 --> 51:41.827
That and nothing more.

51:45.091 --> 51:46.208
Mr. Best?

51:49.141 --> 51:51.208
Follow the bonds.

52:07.842 --> 52:09.983
Goddamn, I'm good.

52:10.804 --> 52:13.338
Now, I took the mud
apart every way I could.

52:13.340 --> 52:15.941
And it's done with
chromium. Chromium sulfate.

52:16.235 --> 52:17.747
They use that in tanneries.

52:17.748 --> 52:20.941
And ammonia, in these quantities, I'd
say, it's the runoff of a dyeworks.

52:20.942 --> 52:22.178
-I'll get on it.
-Wait, wait.

52:22.521 --> 52:23.852
I narrowed the field.

52:23.853 --> 52:26.458
All the ammonia in this
one, it's gonna be overgrown.

52:26.459 --> 52:28.954
The butterfly wing, it's
all the same breed, right?

52:28.956 --> 52:30.415
Old world swallowtail.

52:30.416 --> 52:32.421
Lepidopterist at the zoo identified it.

52:32.422 --> 52:34.426
And they feed on milk parsley.

52:34.963 --> 52:36.380
My guess is, he catches these

52:36.381 --> 52:38.196
on account that it's right on his doorstep.

52:39.049 --> 52:41.424
That's the best I can
do for an "X" and "Y."

52:44.568 --> 52:45.901
Fine work.

52:47.714 --> 52:48.813
Have at it.

52:56.924 --> 52:58.281
Inspector!

52:58.493 --> 53:01.516
Buckley's place, they know it.

53:02.642 --> 53:05.535
I come for you Alice. I come for you.

53:09.857 --> 53:11.323
Buckley.

53:11.325 --> 53:12.757
Horace Buckley.

53:37.280 --> 53:39.384
When may I go home, Miss Susan?

53:40.280 --> 53:42.062
Before you know it.

53:43.723 --> 53:44.871
Here...

53:44.991 --> 53:47.371
Eat up your prunes and custard.

53:47.378 --> 53:49.663
You need your strength to fly, you know.

53:50.991 --> 53:54.364
Daddy says my wings will never
grow back outside my pupa.

53:55.010 --> 53:58.069
Don't fret little one, we, um...

53:58.763 --> 54:01.139
We've special medicines here.

54:01.259 --> 54:03.192
You will grow perfectly.

54:03.927 --> 54:06.394
Perhaps this can even be your home.

54:12.051 --> 54:13.259
Alice?

54:14.447 --> 54:16.088
The wicked king...

54:17.195 --> 54:21.051
-Was he very cruel?
-He pretended to be good...

54:22.611 --> 54:24.363
Pretended to be kind...

54:26.497 --> 54:28.682
So I'd forget I was a fairy.

54:29.114 --> 54:30.534
And do you remember...

54:31.108 --> 54:34.230
you told me that the king
called you by another name...

54:34.490 --> 54:36.302
Can you say that name now?

54:37.238 --> 54:38.940
Daddy told me not to,

54:39.060 --> 54:41.014
or they'd find me again.

54:43.672 --> 54:45.846
Not here my love...

54:46.460 --> 54:48.755
I'm making a place you see...

54:48.875 --> 54:51.483
A special garden of my own.

54:52.248 --> 54:55.590
A place where young
girls can always be safe,

54:56.234 --> 54:59.110
I know about the cruellties of this world,

54:59.728 --> 55:03.231
and I would slay any wicked
king that came for you here.

55:04.117 --> 55:05.758
Slay 'em dead.

55:20.386 --> 55:22.061
Is it true?

55:23.322 --> 55:25.756
The girl is Reid's daughter?

55:27.293 --> 55:28.692
I believe so.

55:30.297 --> 55:32.724
And you've not yet sent word?

55:35.110 --> 55:38.140
There remain concerns for
the girl's fragility of mind.

55:40.534 --> 55:42.408
At the moment Dr. Frayn
is certain she has the

55:42.409 --> 55:44.699
strength that should see
father and daughter reunited.

55:45.533 --> 55:47.495
Edmund Reid becomes a danger.

55:48.172 --> 55:49.964
I have a man at the East London bank.

55:49.966 --> 55:52.500
He tells me a police wire
was sent across the city

55:52.502 --> 55:55.603
inquiring after bearer bonds,
and Reid has found Buckley.

55:55.605 --> 55:57.471
The man draws ever closer.

55:57.473 --> 56:01.576
However, there remains, I believe...

56:04.847 --> 56:06.714
a means of deflection.

56:10.220 --> 56:15.723
We are, after all, not without collateral.

56:20.697 --> 56:22.834
We are not.

56:38.524 --> 56:41.702
What we ask, we ask only
for the sake of the girl.

56:42.149 --> 56:45.372
Her confusion, after all, remains...

56:45.647 --> 56:47.522
Dr. Frayn, all of us know too well

56:47.547 --> 56:50.094
what befalls lost
children on these streets.

56:50.514 --> 56:53.207
Orphan house to workhouse to whorehouse.

56:53.208 --> 56:55.298
Whitechapel will swallow her whole.

56:55.464 --> 56:57.341
We can protect her from that.

56:57.454 --> 57:00.179
We can see that a semblance
of hope yet awaits her.

57:00.773 --> 57:02.675
A stricken child.

57:05.080 --> 57:07.448
A broken mind is not a broken bone.

57:07.449 --> 57:10.183
There is no standard prognosis.

57:10.541 --> 57:13.987
And her confusion remains a great concern.

57:14.276 --> 57:16.272
I will do right by the girl.

57:16.725 --> 57:18.524
You've my word.

57:19.961 --> 57:21.694
What is it you ask of me?

57:27.415 --> 57:30.091
Did you kill your wife, Mr. Buckley?

57:30.092 --> 57:30.893
No.

57:30.895 --> 57:32.595
-Kendrick, then? Who?
-I...

57:32.597 --> 57:34.931
Tell us about your cellar, Mr. Buckley.

57:34.933 --> 57:36.165
My... my...

57:36.167 --> 57:37.767
Who did you keep in your cellar?

57:37.769 --> 57:40.961
Nothing. Mr. Capshaw, he dropped my Clara.

57:41.205 --> 57:44.077
He k... killed her. He killed her.

57:44.112 --> 57:46.086
I'm... I'm not a brave man.

57:46.087 --> 57:48.544
Capshaw? Ronald Capshaw, he was there?

57:49.246 --> 57:50.713
He ruined our world.

57:50.715 --> 57:52.540
Will this be your testimony, Mr. Buckley?

57:52.541 --> 57:54.315
Will you speak up for your wife in court

57:54.317 --> 57:55.952
so that we may punish her killer?

57:55.953 --> 57:57.687
Yes, and then I shall be free.

57:57.689 --> 58:00.357
<i>Who is the child?</i>

58:02.920 --> 58:03.856
Cellar?

58:03.857 --> 58:06.887
P... p... p... perhaps Clara...

58:09.187 --> 58:12.630
We take Capshaw first.
Buckley's going nowhere.

58:17.076 --> 58:20.322
-Can't hear a thing, can we.
-Hold still damn it.

58:20.654 --> 58:22.828
It's just wax, is all.

58:22.948 --> 58:25.476
Enough for Madame Tussaud's,
but it won't kill you.

58:25.596 --> 58:27.460
Come by the surgery...

58:27.580 --> 58:30.399
We're taking Capshaw, he
killed the Buckley woman.

58:31.647 --> 58:34.115
-Capshaw?
-Not your business, Jackson.

58:34.126 --> 58:35.551
Yeah, the hell it isn't.

58:41.421 --> 58:42.990
I couldn't stop them!

58:42.991 --> 58:45.518
Take him in for the
murder of Clara Buckley!

58:45.638 --> 58:47.629
Where is the mistress of this house?

58:47.631 --> 58:49.397
Good day, Inspector.

58:49.399 --> 58:53.134
Before you take Mr. Capshaw,
I beg you to hear me.

58:53.236 --> 58:55.672
I have not afforded
you the full candor I...

58:58.308 --> 59:01.938
We have both always strived above all else

59:01.939 --> 59:03.745
to make safe this small quarter.

59:03.747 --> 59:05.947
Made our mission to protect,

59:05.949 --> 59:07.782
but today, you protect the wrong man.

59:07.784 --> 59:10.885
Horace and Clara Buckley
were not victims, Inspector.

59:10.887 --> 59:12.954
You saw the cellar.

59:13.561 --> 59:16.157
Mr. Capshaw and Mr. Kendrick found her.

59:23.300 --> 59:25.400
Where? Where is she?

59:25.402 --> 59:28.203
I summoned doctors, but
her suffering was too great.

59:28.205 --> 59:30.905
Dr... Dr. Amelia Frayn, Inspector.

59:30.908 --> 59:33.062
She strived her utmost, but...

59:33.125 --> 59:36.443
Her suffering had been
too great and for too long.

59:36.487 --> 59:37.987
The trauma, I believe,

59:37.988 --> 59:41.638
of taking her from her... from her dungeon.

59:42.001 --> 59:43.163
I...

59:43.547 --> 59:46.593
There was nothing could
be done for the child, sir.

59:47.122 --> 59:48.690
Her peace came swiftly.

59:48.692 --> 59:50.592
For that, at least, we may be grateful.

59:50.594 --> 59:53.743
Where is she?

59:54.588 --> 59:57.011
She was buried this morning.

59:57.805 --> 01:00:00.201
She could not speak, Inspector.

01:00:00.203 --> 01:00:02.904
Could not walk for rickets.

01:00:02.906 --> 01:00:08.309
Had been starved, tortured, forced.

01:00:10.347 --> 01:00:13.114
And it is her rescuer, Mr. Capshaw,

01:00:13.116 --> 01:00:14.344
you now seek to shackle

01:00:14.345 --> 01:00:18.486
on the word of the monster that
made her slave and plaything.

01:00:22.793 --> 01:00:27.184
But why... why did you
not bring this to me?

01:00:27.892 --> 01:00:29.297
Why?!

01:00:32.035 --> 01:00:34.569
Because, Mr. Reid,

01:00:34.767 --> 01:00:36.237
I could not be sure

01:00:36.239 --> 01:00:40.408
this poor, broken girl
was not your daughter.

01:00:45.649 --> 01:00:48.552
Jesus Christ, Susan!

01:00:50.145 --> 01:00:51.719
How dare you.

01:00:53.156 --> 01:00:54.989
Her burns, Dr. Frayn.

01:00:56.393 --> 01:01:02.230
There was scarring... scars
of fire all upon her back.

01:01:02.232 --> 01:01:03.431
Her age was...

01:01:03.433 --> 01:01:04.833
This ain't right, woman.

01:01:04.835 --> 01:01:08.786
I'm not claiming it is so,
but if she were your Matilda,

01:01:08.787 --> 01:01:12.106
I would not have had you
look upon her in that way.

01:01:12.108 --> 01:01:14.576
I sought to protect you from that horror.

01:01:14.578 --> 01:01:16.945
But she was someone's child.

01:01:16.947 --> 01:01:19.214
And if you still wish
to charge Mr. Capshaw...

01:01:19.216 --> 01:01:21.482
-Take him in.
-But if it were Matilda

01:01:21.484 --> 01:01:23.718
kept by Horace Buckley, what then?

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:27.856
What vengeance could there
be that would not destroy you?

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:30.725
Buckley.

01:01:32.095 --> 01:01:34.028
I will know the truth.

01:01:51.807 --> 01:01:53.557
Who was she?!

01:01:54.319 --> 01:01:55.418
Sir?

01:01:55.677 --> 01:01:57.372
The girl in the cellar!

01:01:57.373 --> 01:01:58.494
What cellar?!

01:01:58.533 --> 01:02:01.815
What cellar? What cellar? I
shall show you what cellar!

01:02:04.498 --> 01:02:07.066
I beg you, sir. I beg you, sir! Please!

01:02:12.339 --> 01:02:13.661
Open the door!

01:02:13.687 --> 01:02:17.025
Please, I beg you, sir.
I beg you, sir, please!

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:18.441
Please, I didn't mean to!

01:02:18.450 --> 01:02:20.173
-What cellar?!
-Please!

01:02:20.175 --> 01:02:21.708
Please, I didn't mean to...

01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:24.604
she was my little fairy,
the river's precious gift.

01:02:24.639 --> 01:02:26.316
The river? The river?!

01:02:26.317 --> 01:02:28.160
-Who was she?
-Alice, my princess.

01:02:28.161 --> 01:02:29.082
I never stole.

01:02:29.084 --> 01:02:30.635
The wicked king,

01:02:30.636 --> 01:02:32.087
his ship of fire...

01:02:32.088 --> 01:02:34.087
she was burned so bad that I...

01:02:38.618 --> 01:02:39.456
Sir...

01:02:39.831 --> 01:02:43.124
I will know the truth... I will know.

01:02:46.023 --> 01:02:47.089
No, sir!

01:02:50.795 --> 01:02:52.194
Reid!

01:02:57.468 --> 01:02:58.701
Who was she?

01:02:58.703 --> 01:03:01.959
We just wanted a child, sir.
We so wanted a child. And...

01:03:06.943 --> 01:03:09.791
You tortured her, and
then you murdered her!

01:03:09.792 --> 01:03:11.548
No, no! I love her.

01:03:11.549 --> 01:03:13.549
I love her. She's my little princess.

01:03:13.550 --> 01:03:15.787
-Where is she? Is she safe?
-Her name!

01:03:15.788 --> 01:03:16.630
Alice.

01:03:16.631 --> 01:03:18.118
Don't lie to me!

01:03:18.119 --> 01:03:19.430
Who was she?!

01:03:19.431 --> 01:03:20.149
Reid!

01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:22.249
When I found her, she never knew,

01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:24.586
and I made the stories to help her,

01:03:24.587 --> 01:03:26.979
and th... th... then sh... she remembered.

01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:28.430
Remembered what?

01:03:28.699 --> 01:03:30.766
I... I needed t... t... to help her.

01:03:30.767 --> 01:03:34.259
I... I knew she... she wasn't a real fairy,

01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:36.428
but... but I... I made her believe.

01:03:36.429 --> 01:03:39.173
She remembered what?

01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:42.903
Who... who she...

01:03:42.904 --> 01:03:45.540
h... her name.

01:03:47.802 --> 01:03:48.920
M... M...

01:03:48.921 --> 01:03:50.351
M... Matilda.

01:03:50.789 --> 01:03:51.855
Matilda.

01:03:54.898 --> 01:03:58.094
M... M... Matilda Reid.

01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:10.508
She was my daughter.

01:04:14.893 --> 01:04:17.452
The day she said her name,

01:04:17.453 --> 01:04:20.614
I... I... I... I knew she was yours.

01:04:21.638 --> 01:04:23.233
How?

01:04:23.235 --> 01:04:25.940
How could you keep her from me?

01:04:26.501 --> 01:04:27.913
She feared you!

01:04:27.982 --> 01:04:31.775
The death around you, like a black halo.

01:04:31.777 --> 01:04:35.479
Your own daughter had t...
t... t... terror of you.

01:04:38.164 --> 01:04:39.570
You...

01:04:39.614 --> 01:04:42.652
N... never loved her the w... way I did.

01:04:42.654 --> 01:04:45.055
You couldn't love her
enough to keep her safe.

01:04:48.994 --> 01:04:50.327
Reid.

01:04:50.329 --> 01:04:52.529
Reid, do not do this, brother.

01:04:53.110 --> 01:04:54.865
Do not do this.

01:04:54.867 --> 01:04:57.067
Listen to him, Edmund.

01:04:57.069 --> 01:04:58.135
Edmund!

01:04:59.204 --> 01:05:00.737
Don't do it.

01:05:00.739 --> 01:05:03.440
Reid. Listen to him.

01:05:03.442 --> 01:05:05.117
-No.
-You can't.

01:05:10.801 --> 01:05:12.125
Reid!

01:05:12.463 --> 01:05:13.332
No!

01:05:45.239 --> 01:05:46.641
Inspector...

01:05:47.143 --> 01:05:49.476
You may have five minutes.

01:05:50.299 --> 01:05:51.855
I can give no more.
