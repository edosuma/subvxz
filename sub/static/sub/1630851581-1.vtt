Hey, Liv! What up? Where's Andy?

00:42.960 --> 00:44.920
Guess what!
He's already at school!

00:44.920 --> 00:47.589
‐ Really? Andy? At school?
‐ Yeah!

00:47.589 --> 00:49.591
He said he was
going to school early

00:49.591 --> 00:51.802
to put the final touches
on our project!

00:51.802 --> 00:55.013
Yes! Finally!
He's starting to listen!

00:55.013 --> 00:58.183
I knew I'd get Andy
back on the path to success!

01:03.272 --> 01:06.567
‐ Finally listening to you, huh?
‐ One can always hope.

01:06.567 --> 01:10.946
Ha, ha! Give up yet?
80‐73 in your face!

01:10.946 --> 01:12.823
Rematch after class!

01:14.074 --> 01:18.787
See that? Did you check out
that raw power?

01:18.787 --> 01:22.040
Hey! Wait up!
Come on! Seriously?

01:23.709 --> 01:26.878
Hold up, Mikey, you don't want
your usual, anchovy,

01:26.878 --> 01:30.674
soda bread, chocolate, wasabi
and a sliver of bitter orange?

01:30.674 --> 01:33.677
100% phosphorus!

01:33.677 --> 01:36.930
Nah, forget about it, Roland.
It's for our science project.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.516
It's due this morning.
Right, Andy?

01:39.516 --> 01:42.102
‐ (Sheepish laugh)
‐ Let's go for a Bananice!

01:44.229 --> 01:46.857
‐ Thanks!
‐ Catch you later, Roland!

01:46.857 --> 01:48.859
Yeah, have a good one, kids!

DRAKE: Andy Baker!

You've got
something that's mine.

01:55.741 --> 01:57.826
You're talking about this?
Catch!

01:59.286 --> 02:00.203
I got it, I got it!

02:01.371 --> 02:02.748
Huh?

02:12.799 --> 02:16.011
Later, Drake!
Don't want to be late for class!

Argh! Bobby! Do something!

02:18.639 --> 02:20.390
(Moaning)

02:20.390 --> 02:21.808
Grr!

02:24.353 --> 02:26.229
Yo! Yo!
Give me a hand, will you!

02:37.658 --> 02:40.369
Aaah!

02:41.620 --> 02:42.621
Drake?

02:49.294 --> 02:52.589
MIKE: For the science project,
today we'll demonstrate

02:52.589 --> 02:56.134
the power of an ecological force
that is often underestimated.

02:58.553 --> 03:00.889
‐ A banana?
‐ (Laughter)

03:02.641 --> 03:05.560
No, Rajat! This banana
is simply a teaching tool

03:05.560 --> 03:07.604
to show you in a concise,
unique way

03:07.604 --> 03:11.149
the power that is at the core
of this demonstration.

03:11.149 --> 03:14.027
‐ I give you...
‐ The sun!

03:14.027 --> 03:15.862
The sun!

BOBBY: Aaah!

03:17.864 --> 03:21.410
‐ Somebody help me!
‐ Huh? What's going on?

03:21.410 --> 03:24.871
Oh! Children!
Oh, this is fascinating.

03:24.871 --> 03:28.041
A rare phenomenon
of spontaneous flash freeze!

03:28.041 --> 03:31.211
Amazing! Another frozen banana!

03:31.211 --> 03:33.880
Oh, but of course, Andy! Ha, ha!

03:33.880 --> 03:37.426
Let us use your device
to unthaw your classmate!

03:37.426 --> 03:39.594
You got it, sir!

03:39.594 --> 03:40.887
Uh! Liv?

03:46.893 --> 03:48.395
That's actually pretty cool!

03:50.814 --> 03:52.732
STUDENTS: Yeah!

03:53.817 --> 03:57.112
Aaah! Huh?

03:57.112 --> 04:00.073
(Laughter)

04:07.873 --> 04:08.915
Ah!

04:12.377 --> 04:16.298
Yo! that's my bananice!
Don't touch! I said it's mine!

04:20.552 --> 04:22.763

04:52.918 --> 04:54.336
Huh?

05:00.675 --> 05:03.929
‐ Miss Jones, did you see that?
<i>‐ See what?</i>

05:03.929 --> 05:06.097
<i>Oh, you mean the ghost.</i>

05:06.097 --> 05:09.142
<i>We're dealing with a category 6</i>
<i>ice‐class phantom</i>

05:09.142 --> 05:12.312
<i>called Freezofear.</i>
<i>Its attacks can be dangerous.</i>

05:12.312 --> 05:14.856
<i>Nothing irreversible</i>
<i>in its current state.</i>

05:14.856 --> 05:18.401

05:21.071 --> 05:24.241

‐ What?
<i>‐ Basically,</i>

05:25.659 --> 05:27.869
<i>don't let it eat</i>
<i>anything frozen!</i>

05:27.869 --> 05:30.872
Yeah, no risk of that!
The only thing cold is this ‐‐

05:30.872 --> 05:34.584

(Roars)

05:59.818 --> 06:01.194
(Chuckles)

06:05.240 --> 06:08.201
Looks like we're in for
some spine‐chilling weather.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.036
Then we'd better
put that ghost on ice!

06:10.036 --> 06:12.080

Rats! Now what?
All right, listen up, team.

07:11.473 --> 07:13.308
‐ Here's the plan!
‐ I'll test a sample.

07:13.308 --> 07:14.934
I'll check the building!

07:18.855 --> 07:20.357
Nothing. It's empty!

Let the pro handle it!

07:26.738 --> 07:28.698
Oh, interesting!

07:28.698 --> 07:31.826
An inverted triple ectoplasmic
phase, traces of potassium,

07:31.826 --> 07:34.621
isoamyl acetate... I knew it!

07:34.621 --> 07:37.874

07:45.674 --> 07:47.258
‐ Guys...
‐ I'd rather not.

07:47.258 --> 07:50.261

ALL: No!

09:32.155 --> 09:35.450

After him!

09:42.207 --> 09:43.750

‐ Oh, no!

10:09.150 --> 10:11.569
‐ If we can't fix this...
‐ The entire world

10:11.569 --> 10:13.488
is heading straight
to a new Ice Age!

10:13.488 --> 10:15.490
A Banananice Age!

10:15.490 --> 10:17.659
Is that your next
science project?

10:18.827 --> 10:20.995
Science project? That's it!

10:20.995 --> 10:23.498
Myst, you punch a hole
in these clouds.

10:23.498 --> 10:25.333
Krush, you deal with the loop!

10:25.333 --> 10:27.961
Oh! You mean
the convergence effect?

10:27.961 --> 10:31.464
Same setup as our science
project, but way bigger!

10:31.464 --> 10:33.883
And I'll set the stage.

10:34.509 --> 10:37.137
‐ (Growling)
‐ Yo, big banana!

10:37.137 --> 10:38.346
Ever slip on your own peel?

10:39.055 --> 10:40.974
Looks like you fell off the tree

10:40.974 --> 10:43.184
and hit every branch
on the way down!

10:43.184 --> 10:43.852

11:54.297 --> 11:58.468
<i>‐ Great job, guys!</i>
‐ Thanks, Miss Jones!

11:59.802 --> 12:02.347
You see, Andy?
The knowledge you gain in class

12:02.347 --> 12:05.642
‐ can be practical in real life.
‐ What was that again, Mike?

12:05.642 --> 12:08.061
‐ Sorry, wasn't listening!
‐ I was saying ‐‐

12:08.061 --> 12:10.772
Yo, Drake! Payback time!

12:17.403 --> 12:19.614
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen

12:19.614 --> 12:23.201
and welcome to this exceptional
closing ceremony.

12:23.201 --> 12:26.204
It was a great honour
to show in our museum

12:26.204 --> 12:31.459
the mask of Pharases II,
a marvel of the Egyptian era!

12:31.459 --> 12:35.255
And we can thank Mr Collins
for lending us this piece

12:35.255 --> 12:37.590
from his personal collection.

12:37.590 --> 12:40.301
The pleasure's all mine,
Professor Pascal.

12:40.301 --> 12:44.222
I've been delighted to share
it with New York city.

12:44.222 --> 12:47.684
But now it's going back
to my home sweet home.

12:47.684 --> 12:49.644
‐ (Laughter)
‐ (Slurping)

12:59.320 --> 13:01.030
(Slurps) Aaah!

13:01.030 --> 13:03.783
Mom, I burned my tongue!

13:13.084 --> 13:16.504
Krush is totes
my fave Ghost Force guy!

13:16.504 --> 13:19.465
Check him out in action.
His super‐smart strategies,

13:19.465 --> 13:21.634
his super‐cool moves,

13:21.634 --> 13:24.429
and blue is totes
my favourite colour too!

13:24.429 --> 13:26.931
But severely lacking
in Fury action.

13:26.931 --> 13:29.892
I know. He's totes lame
compared to Krush!

13:29.892 --> 13:33.813
Anyway, glad you liked it.
See you in class after lunch.

13:33.813 --> 13:37.525
We're doing Pharases II.
He's totes my favourite pharaoh.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.988
Dude, Charlie's
your biggest fangirl!

13:42.405 --> 13:46.451
‐ And I'm her biggest fanboy!
‐ Then what are you waiting for?

13:46.451 --> 13:49.746
‐ She's a fan of Krush.
‐ But you're Krush!

13:49.746 --> 13:52.373
‐ Forget it, Andy!
‐ Come on!

13:52.373 --> 13:56.127
Don't you see she handed you
the opportunity of a lifetime?

13:56.753 --> 13:59.630
‐ Uh... my dad?
‐ The mask!

14:00.048 --> 14:02.508
The one your dad
bought of of Pharases II,

14:02.508 --> 14:05.386
who is Charlie's
favourite pharaoh!

14:05.386 --> 14:08.848
So, you plus the mask,
plus Charlie,

14:08.848 --> 14:11.309
equals royal pharaoh wedding!

14:13.269 --> 14:16.022
Just borrow the mask
and return it after school.

14:16.022 --> 14:18.608
But my dad would never
let me take it to school!

14:18.608 --> 14:20.359
Do you want Charlie to like you,

14:20.359 --> 14:22.653
or the other super‐you
in the blue onesie?

14:31.788 --> 14:33.456
‐ So, did you get it?
‐ Shh!

14:37.085 --> 14:39.754
So, here's the plan.
You enter class last,

14:39.754 --> 14:43.257
wearing the mask on your face!
Awesome, huh?

14:43.257 --> 14:46.469
Is that <i>the</i> one‐and‐only,
super‐expensive mask

14:46.469 --> 14:49.430
that your dad guards
so carefully in your house?

14:49.430 --> 14:53.392
Trust me, this is gonna be
totally pharaobulus!

15:02.610 --> 15:07.198
Today's lesson is... uh. Oh!
Where did I put my slideshow?

15:09.325 --> 15:10.743
(Sighs)

15:12.161 --> 15:15.706
Michael Collins! What
are you doing between classes

15:15.706 --> 15:17.625
in that ridiculous getup?

15:17.625 --> 15:20.670
‐ Mr Vladosky?
‐ Confiscated!

15:20.670 --> 15:24.215
Your dad will sure be happy
to pick up your little mask

15:24.215 --> 15:26.801
from my office.

15:26.801 --> 15:28.886
Now get to class this instant!

15:30.638 --> 15:31.973
(Sighs)

15:33.391 --> 15:36.435
‐ All hail Pharases II!
‐ (Egyptian music)

15:36.435 --> 15:39.522
‐ (Gasps)
‐ (Laughter)

15:40.773 --> 15:43.359
(Laughter continues)

15:48.281 --> 15:51.033
‐ Dude, where'd the mask go?
‐ Vladosky.

15:51.033 --> 15:54.495
‐ How are you gonna get it back?
‐ I'm not. He's calling my dad.

15:54.495 --> 15:56.581
I'm gonna be in serious trouble!

15:56.581 --> 16:01.294
Given the situation, we will
talk about Pharaoh Pharases II.

16:01.294 --> 16:04.755
Whoa! Hear that?
Your dad's mask is legend!

16:04.755 --> 16:07.592
And cursed,
but I already figured that out.

16:07.592 --> 16:11.679
Pharases II is known to have
succeeded in building a pyramid

16:11.679 --> 16:13.681
in a single day!

16:13.681 --> 16:16.559
<i>No one has ever understood</i>
<i>how he did it.</i>

16:16.559 --> 16:20.688
<i>But some legends say</i>
<i>he used paranormal forces.</i>

16:27.486 --> 16:29.405
(Groaning)

16:30.031 --> 16:32.700
Let's continue class
in the park, shall we?

16:32.700 --> 16:34.869
It's way too hot in here!

16:42.877 --> 16:44.670
(Laughter)

16:45.546 --> 16:47.590
Ugh! It's too hot!

16:49.467 --> 16:50.593
(Laughter)

16:51.552 --> 16:52.553
Is that Bobby?

16:52.553 --> 16:53.763
(Laughter)

16:56.265 --> 16:58.017
‐ Huh?
‐ Aaah!

17:00.770 --> 17:02.647
(Laughter)

17:03.648 --> 17:05.691
‐ Boo!
‐ Aaah!

17:07.860 --> 17:10.363
‐ Uh‐oh!
‐ Aaah!

17:17.411 --> 17:20.331
Miss Jones, do you hear me?
Miss Jones!

17:20.331 --> 17:22.708
Weird.
She usually always answers!

17:24.502 --> 17:25.711
(Laughter)

17:29.924 --> 17:31.592
Let's go, Ghost Force!

17:31.592 --> 17:32.927
Miss Jones first!

17:37.056 --> 17:40.226
When a ghost comes near,
the Ghost Force is here!

18:00.204 --> 18:02.915
‐ Miss Jones?
‐ Miss Jones, where are you?

18:02.915 --> 18:04.667
Over here!

18:05.918 --> 18:08.588
‐ Hey, guys!
‐ Miss Jones?

18:08.588 --> 18:10.006
What are you doing
in the fridge?

18:10.423 --> 18:12.174
It's because of Pharaok.

18:12.174 --> 18:16.470
The heat he released
is exhausting my boo energy.

18:16.470 --> 18:18.639
All the information you need
is on the interface.

18:21.601 --> 18:25.605
"Pharaok. A level‐7 ghost
from the bizzaroid family.

18:25.605 --> 18:29.233
It exudes heat that even
overwhelms other ghosts."

18:29.233 --> 18:33.029
You must do everything to stop
it before it siphons enough fear

18:33.029 --> 18:35.364
to initiate booster mode!

18:35.781 --> 18:37.867
Let's go, Ghost Force!

18:38.701 --> 18:40.953
<i>♪ Ghost Force,</i>
<i>don't fear the glow! ♪</i>

18:46.626 --> 18:47.877
Fury!

18:48.586 --> 18:50.171
Krush!

18:51.547 --> 18:52.840
Myst!

18:56.552 --> 18:57.595
♪ Ghost Force!

19:03.726 --> 19:06.228
According to Ms Jones' map,
the ghost should be around here.

19:07.563 --> 19:10.399
‐ Already?
‐ The heat affects our energy.

19:10.399 --> 19:12.401
Let's avoid flying
to save our strength!

19:14.195 --> 19:16.656
So, where is that ghost hiding?

19:16.656 --> 19:18.074
(Gasps)

19:23.788 --> 19:24.830
(Laughter)

19:26.165 --> 19:28.250
Here comes the Ghost Force
to save New York once again!

19:32.546 --> 19:33.297
Aaah!

19:35.716 --> 19:36.676
Charlie!

19:40.846 --> 19:42.765
BOTH: Krush, no!

19:45.935 --> 19:49.063
‐ We just lost Krush.
‐ And things will get worse!

19:52.817 --> 19:55.027
(Laughter)

19:55.027 --> 19:56.529
(Threatening sound)

20:01.450 --> 20:02.660
Boo!

20:03.994 --> 20:05.746
He's switched to boo‐ster mode!

20:11.752 --> 20:14.004
(Evil laugh)

20:23.848 --> 20:27.059
OK, now we know how Pharaok
managed to build a pyramid

20:27.059 --> 20:28.018
‐ in a day!
‐ We must hurry!

20:28.978 --> 20:32.064
Our boo energy is draining
more and more. Stay here, OK?

20:37.653 --> 20:39.113
(Evil laugh)

20:39.113 --> 20:41.949
‐ Whoa!
‐ Whoa! Whoa!

20:45.161 --> 20:47.538
‐ It's gotta have a weak spot.
‐ I know mine

20:47.538 --> 20:49.498
and it's
ancient Egyptian ghosts!

20:49.498 --> 20:52.084
Then here's a refresher.
Avoid all contact!

21:02.094 --> 21:03.929
‐ Boo!
‐ Aaah!

21:13.689 --> 21:15.399
The mummies
are its weak point.

21:15.399 --> 21:17.943
The more we free,
the weaker Pharaok becomes.

21:17.943 --> 21:19.445
OK, got it!

21:21.113 --> 21:23.324
Meteor Combo Blast!

21:26.744 --> 21:27.453
Oh!

21:32.124 --> 21:33.459
It's working!

21:36.587 --> 21:37.505
Hey!

21:38.714 --> 21:41.300
Good to be back, guys!
Where's Charlie?

21:41.300 --> 21:43.135
You mean your giant crush,
Krush?

21:43.135 --> 21:45.095
What?
Where'd you get that from?

21:48.182 --> 21:49.892
We're almost out of boo energy.

21:49.892 --> 21:51.560
It's our last chance
to catch it!

22:00.152 --> 22:02.988
Yo! Over here!

22:02.988 --> 22:04.198
Mwah, mwah, mwah!

22:04.615 --> 22:06.784
Grr!

22:11.247 --> 22:12.957
Plexiglass!

22:16.794 --> 22:17.461
Huh?

22:20.005 --> 22:22.091
It's losing power!
It's up to you, Krush!

22:26.762 --> 22:28.264
Grow Max!

22:33.602 --> 22:35.855
Grr!

22:48.951 --> 22:49.869
Aaah!

23:02.047 --> 23:05.926
Boo‐yah!

23:10.264 --> 23:13.267
Krush is totes
the star of Ghost Force!

23:13.267 --> 23:16.729
Check out my watch and his
armour, same shade of blue!

23:16.729 --> 23:18.355
See?

23:18.355 --> 23:21.150
Well, that was a total fail

23:21.150 --> 23:23.652
and Vladosky
still has the mask!

23:23.652 --> 23:27.031
‐ You mean this mask?
‐ How did you... ?

23:27.031 --> 23:28.949
I'm a guy of many talents.

23:28.949 --> 23:32.286
‐ Wait. I got another idea...
‐ Drop it, bro.

23:32.286 --> 23:34.288
‐ Let me give it a shot!
‐ Liv, don't ‐‐

23:34.288 --> 23:37.625
Charlie! Did you know that
Mike's a huge Krush fanboy too,

23:37.625 --> 23:40.628
‐ and he loves ancient Egypt?
‐ OMG. Really?

23:40.628 --> 23:42.838
Hey, Mike!
Why don't we go to your place

23:42.838 --> 23:45.215
and check out that mask
from the collection.

23:45.215 --> 23:47.468
It used to belong
to Pharases II!

23:47.468 --> 23:51.805
‐ Is she seriously serious?
‐ Yeah. It is pretty cool!
