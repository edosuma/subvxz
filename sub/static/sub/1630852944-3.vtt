00:16.500 --> 00:18.133
The decision
by the Dundee Times

00:18.267 --> 00:19.300
to publish the letter

00:19.433 --> 00:21.100
is seen by some as surprising,

00:21.233 --> 00:23.200
given the extreme
racist content.

00:23.333 --> 00:25.167
But the newspaper insists
that showing the...

00:25.300 --> 00:27.100
Everyone is talking
about the letter in the paper.

00:28.533 --> 00:30.367
"Let us have a dagger
between our teeth,

00:30.500 --> 00:31.500
a bomb in our hands

00:31.633 --> 00:32.833
and an infinite scorn
in our hearts.

00:32.967 --> 00:34.167
For we are pure.
And they are not."

00:34.300 --> 00:36.167
-Please.
-I think he's left-handed.

00:36.800 --> 00:37.833
-Who?
-The bomber.

00:37.967 --> 00:39.200
Memes all over TikTok about it.

00:40.367 --> 00:41.300
Can I have a lift, Mum?

00:41.433 --> 00:43.233
You'll be ridiculously early.

00:43.367 --> 00:44.500
What's wrong with the bus?

00:51.067 --> 00:52.333
I don't know
how to say this.

00:53.667 --> 00:54.933
But I won't be in today.

00:55.967 --> 00:56.933
Or tomorrow.

00:57.900 --> 00:58.900
I've left Dundee.

02:06.767 --> 02:08.067
Emergency summit.

02:08.167 --> 02:09.333
Sarah's office. Now.

02:09.967 --> 02:11.367
What?

02:11.500 --> 02:13.800
Emma's emigrated to love island
and Sarah's losing her shit.

02:13.933 --> 02:15.067
Bring whatever food you have.

02:15.900 --> 02:17.667
Oh, parcel for you.

02:21.567 --> 02:22.700
They look like new pillows.

02:23.833 --> 02:24.867
How do you do that?

02:25.567 --> 02:26.533
Years of staring.

02:30.500 --> 02:32.300
-Did you call her?
-No.

02:32.433 --> 02:34.667
She asked me to keep
her lab coat for her!

02:34.800 --> 02:36.067
I mean, who does she think
she is?

02:36.200 --> 02:38.233
Some research director
on sabbatical?

02:38.367 --> 02:39.967
"Oh! I've just got to go
and find myself for a few weeks,

02:40.100 --> 02:42.167
so I won't be in. Oh, PS.

02:42.300 --> 02:45.067
Can I just stroll back in
whenever I fancy?"

02:45.167 --> 02:47.533
I'm a little bit surprised,
I have to say.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.567
-I'm furious.
-Look, she's young.

02:49.700 --> 02:51.100
They do whatever the hell
they want.

02:51.233 --> 02:52.300
Life doesn't work like that.

02:52.433 --> 02:54.067
For young people
it sort of does.

02:54.200 --> 02:56.167
I have supported her
throughout this whole thing.

02:56.300 --> 02:58.467
-You have.
-Every step of it.

02:58.600 --> 03:00.133
So, maybe she assumed
you'd get it.

03:01.700 --> 03:04.100
Sarah, Phil MacAfee walked out
of that court room.

03:04.233 --> 03:07.067
He walked out into the city
where she lives.

03:07.133 --> 03:09.133
The man who murdered her mother.

03:09.267 --> 03:11.133
So. She's scared. She's angry.

03:11.267 --> 03:12.200
She bolts.

03:12.333 --> 03:13.967
You can't just run away.

03:14.100 --> 03:15.400
She wasn't thinking straight.

03:15.533 --> 03:16.967
Who is thinking straight?

03:23.867 --> 03:24.867
You alright?

03:27.433 --> 03:28.433
Yeah.

03:29.533 --> 03:32.067
Sweet tea
and luckily for all,

03:32.167 --> 03:34.433
I've brought
some of my scones today.

03:34.567 --> 03:36.267
More now that Emma's gone.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.467
Bad news, good news.
I've got to go.

03:38.600 --> 03:41.767
I've got a scene
out at Loch Lee. Body parts.

03:42.800 --> 03:44.267
No peace for the wicked.

03:45.367 --> 03:47.100
I think it's "no rest"

03:47.233 --> 03:50.333
Wrong. The original,
biblical version is "no peace".

03:52.067 --> 03:53.300
Right.

03:53.433 --> 03:56.333
Kathy, could you run me up
a "Time Allocation Survey"?

03:56.467 --> 03:57.767
-For?
-Me.

03:57.900 --> 04:00.833
So, I can see how you allocate
your professional time.

04:00.967 --> 04:02.333
Say, the week starting
the seventh?

04:03.100 --> 04:04.100
Thanks!

04:05.100 --> 04:06.133
As you were.

04:09.333 --> 04:11.333
-It's just a form.
-No, it's not.

04:11.467 --> 04:12.900
Just breathe. Think of Friday.

04:13.067 --> 04:14.700
You're gonna to be back in time
for your house guest?

04:16.300 --> 04:17.833
That is my intention.

04:17.967 --> 04:19.067
She's got
new pillows.

04:24.833 --> 04:25.867
What size shoe are you?

04:26.933 --> 04:28.567
-Sorry?
-Your first field trip.

04:28.700 --> 04:29.733
We need to find you some waders.

04:31.967 --> 04:34.067
A jaw bone's washed up
out in the sticks.

04:34.200 --> 04:35.267
It's perfect timing
for the study.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.933
I'll pick you up
after the strategy meeting.

04:37.067 --> 04:39.433
Oh, and pack your toothbrush.
It's gonna be an overnight.

04:39.567 --> 04:42.533
No more. 'Cause I've got to be
back, so...

04:44.200 --> 04:45.667
She's scared. She does a runner.

04:46.133 --> 04:47.633
No,

04:47.767 --> 04:50.133
I reckon Phil Macafee
is only got six months
as a free man.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.100
He's got lucky once,

04:53.233 --> 04:54.800
he's still got
the Culp Hom trial to go.

04:54.933 --> 04:57.067
Fiscal says he's got no chance
with that.

04:57.133 --> 04:59.067
I'm just stunned about Emma.

04:59.167 --> 05:03.133
I just feel really
quite toppled by it.

05:03.267 --> 05:04.900
I need to have a word
with myself.

05:05.433 --> 05:06.433
No,

05:07.233 --> 05:08.233
I totally get it.

05:08.867 --> 05:09.900
It hurts.

05:11.067 --> 05:12.167
You were there for her.

05:12.300 --> 05:13.300
So were you.

05:14.500 --> 05:15.500
Yeah.

05:16.933 --> 05:19.500
So, this letter.

05:19.633 --> 05:21.367
You might be lucky.
Get something back from the lab.

05:21.900 --> 05:22.933
DNA? Prints?

05:23.067 --> 05:25.267
Yeah. We're all over it. Yeah...

05:25.400 --> 05:27.733
Kitty recons the author
might be left-handed.

05:27.867 --> 05:29.467
-Your daughter?
-Yeah.

05:29.600 --> 05:32.700
It's all over Twitter.
Or TikTok.

05:32.833 --> 05:35.233
Screen time is way longer
than her sleeping hours.

05:38.533 --> 05:40.667
I'll get that black pill result
to you later today.

05:40.800 --> 05:42.067
Great. Thanks.

05:44.433 --> 05:45.433
Sarah,

05:47.067 --> 05:48.067
about Emma.

05:50.800 --> 05:51.767
She was lucky.

05:52.667 --> 05:53.667
To have you.

06:09.533 --> 06:12.267
Oh, Aye. Dundee Times
are spouting some bullshit

06:12.400 --> 06:15.500
about moral responsibility
to print.

06:15.633 --> 06:16.933
Never mind that far righters

06:17.067 --> 06:20.133
will be retweeting that shit
till Kingdom come.

06:20.267 --> 06:22.733
Apparently some of it's
a Mussolini quote.

06:22.867 --> 06:25.200
The whole thing is a car crash.

06:25.333 --> 06:26.767
He's made us look like clowns.

06:26.900 --> 06:28.933
We don't know the author
of that letter is the bomber.

06:29.067 --> 06:30.100
We don't know it's not.

06:31.667 --> 06:32.833
Still nothing from the lab?

06:32.967 --> 06:34.667
Results any time.

06:34.800 --> 06:36.267
Counter terrorism
are taking apart

06:36.400 --> 06:37.767
the language used in the letter.

06:37.900 --> 06:39.500
They're looking at racist cells.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.433
Alt-right chat rooms.
Recent threats.

06:41.567 --> 06:43.233
Is it from an individual
or a group?

06:43.367 --> 06:44.833
Where are we with Dundeats?

06:44.967 --> 06:46.467
Doesn't physically exist.

06:46.600 --> 06:49.067
No face. No voice.
No contact number. No address.

06:49.167 --> 06:51.633
The whole Dundeats thing
is virtually an algorithm.

06:51.767 --> 06:53.767
So, I finally got through
to a guy

06:53.900 --> 06:55.733
at a call centre in,
well, somewhere,

06:55.867 --> 06:58.733
who could tell me which riders
worked in the area on Sunday

06:58.867 --> 07:00.233
but wouldn't he hand over
the names.

07:00.367 --> 07:02.067
Said the information
was classified.

07:02.200 --> 07:03.333
Oh, please.

07:03.467 --> 07:06.200
So, he's contacting the riders
and they have to,

07:06.333 --> 07:08.767
get this, voluntarily,
come to us.

07:08.900 --> 07:11.300
Great. Now they can
prepare themselves.

07:11.433 --> 07:13.067
Hoover up any gunpowder
lying around

07:13.133 --> 07:14.367
in their Dundeats box.

07:15.500 --> 07:18.067
We need to go to them.
Get out there.

07:18.200 --> 07:20.533
We need to speak
to those riders today.

07:20.667 --> 07:24.467
We need to find out
who collected or delivered food
near the bomb locations.

07:24.600 --> 07:25.967
How long have they worked
for Dundeats.

07:26.100 --> 07:28.767
And did any of them know
Kim and Tam?

07:28.900 --> 07:30.267
Any word on their status?

07:31.067 --> 07:32.333
Legal. Papers are good.

07:33.067 --> 07:34.133
Any family here?

07:34.267 --> 07:35.733
Just each other.
They were friends.

07:35.867 --> 07:37.600
Just friends but good friends.

07:37.733 --> 07:39.367
They grew up
in a children's home in Vietnam,

07:39.500 --> 07:40.767
then moved over here.

07:40.900 --> 07:42.067
No enemies.

07:42.167 --> 07:43.833
That they knew of.

07:43.967 --> 07:45.067
Some of their clients
have written

07:45.167 --> 07:46.600
on the salon's Facebook page.

07:46.733 --> 07:47.800
Nothing but praise.

08:11.967 --> 08:13.067
Wow.

08:14.433 --> 08:15.533
Have you never been out here?

08:16.400 --> 08:17.667
Never been out of the city.

08:17.800 --> 08:20.533
God. I would go insane
if I didn't get out.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.067
You don't live in Dundee?

08:22.133 --> 08:24.467
Outside. In the middle
of nowhere.

08:24.600 --> 08:27.067
Two dogs. No people. Heaven.

08:28.067 --> 08:29.533
-On your own?
-Yup.

08:29.667 --> 08:31.100
-Don't you get lonely?
-No.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.700
It's all I know.
My parents were farmers.
Not entirely by choice.

08:37.233 --> 08:38.600
How do you mean?

08:38.733 --> 08:41.600
It was a mixed race marriage
in Edmonton in the seventies.

08:44.267 --> 08:46.300
Hey, grab my laptop.
We need to prep.

08:50.700 --> 08:53.300
Okay, we wave 'em down.
Flag them.

08:53.433 --> 08:55.200
Do whatever we can
without getting run over.

08:55.333 --> 08:57.233
Keep it light, friendly.

08:57.367 --> 08:58.900
-We need these riders
to open up.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.200
-Hello again.
-Hey.

09:05.333 --> 09:08.400
The contents of the black pill
confirmed as Prazodone.

09:08.533 --> 09:10.767
It's an atypical antidepressant,

09:10.900 --> 09:13.533
- branded as Serapaxin.
-Brilliant.

09:13.667 --> 09:14.767
Well we'll see if we can get
a warrant.

09:14.900 --> 09:16.700
See who's being prescribed it.
Thank you.

09:16.833 --> 09:19.633
And, I had a thought about CCTV.

09:19.767 --> 09:23.400
Have a look at every bit
of footage you have.
After the bomb.

09:23.533 --> 09:26.267
Police footage.
News footage. Everything.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.833
Spree bombers
sometimes come back.
To the scene.

09:28.967 --> 09:31.100
- Revel in their work.
-Okay.

09:31.233 --> 09:32.300
That's great. Thank you.

09:33.067 --> 09:34.067
No problem.

09:37.733 --> 09:39.267
See, see you, then.

09:39.800 --> 09:41.067
Yup. Bye.

09:47.767 --> 09:49.767
All of them? Missing?

09:49.900 --> 09:51.300
One of them is 16 I think.

09:52.533 --> 09:54.400
Yeah. 16.
Missing for eight months.

09:55.533 --> 09:57.233
-So weird.
-Happens.

09:58.067 --> 09:59.100
Young men usually,

09:59.233 --> 10:01.267
go missing every year, up here.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.100
They take off into the wilds.

10:03.233 --> 10:04.433
Proving something or

10:05.767 --> 10:07.200
getting away from something.

10:07.333 --> 10:08.733
Don't know the land.

10:08.867 --> 10:10.500
Get into trouble, drink or

10:11.600 --> 10:12.733
slip and fall into a loch.

10:12.867 --> 10:14.200
And with every one
of those photos

10:14.333 --> 10:16.633
-comes a family
just climbing the walls.
-God.

10:17.333 --> 10:18.567
I know. It's devastating.

10:20.067 --> 10:23.933
But what I've learned is,

10:24.067 --> 10:25.533
identifying those remains

10:25.667 --> 10:26.967
gives a family so much.

10:27.100 --> 10:29.600
It's an opportunity
to know what happened,

10:29.733 --> 10:31.433
and to lay someone
they love to rest.

10:31.567 --> 10:32.567
That's what we do.

10:33.700 --> 10:35.567
We allow that family to move on.

10:36.333 --> 10:37.367
In some sense.

11:22.600 --> 11:24.233
Afternoon, Charlie.

11:25.267 --> 11:26.267
Over here.

11:31.067 --> 11:32.067
There you go.

11:34.767 --> 11:37.633
So. Easily disarticulated
from the head

11:37.767 --> 11:39.933
if submerged in the water
for a few months.

11:40.067 --> 11:43.367
The structure of the jaw means
it can easily be caught
on a root

11:43.500 --> 11:44.967
or low-hanging tree.

11:45.100 --> 11:48.067
Commonly the first part
of a disarticulated body
to wash up.

11:48.200 --> 11:49.200
Why is that useful?

11:50.067 --> 11:51.267
-Dental records?
-Good.

11:51.400 --> 11:53.233
This goes straight
to the odontologist.

11:53.367 --> 11:54.533
We may find an immediate match

11:54.667 --> 11:56.300
which'll save
a lot of mortuary time.

11:56.433 --> 11:58.500
Charlie, can we get this
photographed and sent off
to dental, please?

11:58.633 --> 11:59.633
Sure thing.

12:00.900 --> 12:03.767
You're in charge
of logging all other body parts.

12:03.900 --> 12:07.600
So, when you find something,
don't pick it up.
Let me do that.

12:07.733 --> 12:11.067
You flag it, measure it, log it,
photograph it

12:11.167 --> 12:12.667
and leave it in situ. Okay?

12:14.167 --> 12:15.200
Trust me. You'll be fine.

12:17.867 --> 12:19.167
Easy for you to say.

12:31.533 --> 12:32.967
This came back from pathology.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.700
Fragments found
in one of the victims.

12:43.300 --> 12:44.900
This is mostly shop window.

12:45.567 --> 12:47.567
The glass is thick.

12:48.300 --> 12:49.633
Straight. Flat.

12:51.100 --> 12:52.700
And these bits

12:52.833 --> 12:55.067
could be from the glass jar,
that contained the bomb.

12:55.133 --> 12:56.733
Curved, thinner.

12:56.867 --> 12:58.800
These pieces were found
between the planter
and the shop window,

12:58.933 --> 13:00.400
so it's possible.

13:00.533 --> 13:03.367
But how do we prove
that this is the actual
glass jar

13:03.500 --> 13:06.233
that contained the bomb?
Because that's what
a jury needs to see.

13:06.367 --> 13:08.067
They need to see the actual jar.

13:47.067 --> 13:48.100
There's something here.

13:55.467 --> 13:56.400
What's that?

13:56.533 --> 13:58.233
-Not sure.
-Come on.

13:58.367 --> 14:00.633
-Metacarpal.
-Good. Which?

14:00.767 --> 14:02.633
-Don't know.
-That is the third.

14:04.067 --> 14:05.167
Now we look for more.

14:07.600 --> 14:10.633
Okay, I want
their contact details,

14:10.767 --> 14:13.233
I want a photograph of them
and their bikes

14:13.367 --> 14:16.900
And most importantly,
I want to see their reaction
when they see that picture.

14:17.800 --> 14:18.767
No idea.

14:18.900 --> 14:20.933
Nobody recognises
a Dundeats rider.

14:21.067 --> 14:23.067
We all work for everyone.
Dundeats, Chowcart, Deliverdish.

14:23.200 --> 14:24.167
They don't offer any help.

14:24.300 --> 14:25.667
We're not human. We're robots.

14:25.800 --> 14:27.100
I was hit by a car.

14:27.233 --> 14:28.767
-You ring riders' support.
-Half an hour online training...

14:28.900 --> 14:31.067
First question they ask is,
"How is the food?
Is the food okay?"

14:31.200 --> 14:32.600
People deal drugs
out of these boxes.

14:32.733 --> 14:34.800
Just because someone has
a Dundeats box on their back,

14:34.933 --> 14:36.500
doesn't mean they're doing
a delivery for Dundeats.

14:36.633 --> 14:37.967
I blacked out my box.

14:38.100 --> 14:39.433
They don't give a shit about me.

14:39.567 --> 14:42.700
So, I'm not going to promote
their company name. No way.

14:42.833 --> 14:45.100
The only reason
you make that call
is to keep your job

14:50.700 --> 14:52.467
Can I get some help
over here please?

15:20.500 --> 15:21.500
Here.

15:22.333 --> 15:23.333
What?

15:37.533 --> 15:38.700
I take it all back.

15:38.833 --> 15:41.300
It's not just a lost kid.

15:44.600 --> 15:45.967
Dismembered?

15:46.100 --> 15:48.500
We'll get everything
back to the mortuary and see.

15:48.633 --> 15:49.967
One thing I would say,

15:50.100 --> 15:52.967
if this body went in whole,
this is how it would behave.

15:53.100 --> 15:56.800
But there's still that rope
around those ankles so...

15:56.933 --> 15:59.233
-Suspicious until proved
otherwise.
-Yup.

15:59.367 --> 16:01.167
Okay. I'll hold off
on divers for now

16:01.300 --> 16:03.067
-and then I'll call the fiscal
and the pathologist.
-Great.

16:07.633 --> 16:08.967
So, this is a murder now?

16:09.567 --> 16:11.067
Not necessarily.

16:11.167 --> 16:12.467
But there's rope
around the feet.

16:12.600 --> 16:15.567
Okay. So, obviously a rope
around ankles is not accidental.

16:15.700 --> 16:18.333
But it is not for us
to hypothesize or judge.

16:19.533 --> 16:20.533
Come on. Back to it.

16:27.700 --> 16:28.700
Come and look.

16:34.700 --> 16:37.767
Black on the glass.
I've cleaned away the blood,

16:37.900 --> 16:40.067
leaving two different blacks.
Two layers.

16:40.167 --> 16:43.467
Firstly, we have a thin line
of incinerated condom.

16:43.600 --> 16:46.900
Indistinguishable
from the latex rim
we found with the lid.

16:47.067 --> 16:49.600
We also have potassium chlorate
residue from the bomb itself.

16:49.733 --> 16:51.933
Not much left
because everything burns
so hot and fast.

16:52.067 --> 16:53.500
But... Look...

16:53.633 --> 16:55.067
There's another layer.

16:55.200 --> 16:56.400
A third layer of black.

16:59.100 --> 17:00.667
Ink?

17:00.800 --> 17:03.667
Tell the sorters to look
for other pieces of curved glass
like this.

17:03.800 --> 17:04.833
With bits of black.

17:10.200 --> 17:12.067
Well, that gave us nothing.

17:12.167 --> 17:14.233
I mean, a whole lot of nothing,
but still nothing.

17:14.367 --> 17:17.733
-Apart from some deeply
unhappy riders.
-Aye.

17:17.867 --> 17:21.200
So, we've got a suspect
that wears a uniform
that opens doors

17:21.867 --> 17:22.867
wherever they go.

17:23.067 --> 17:24.267
Who no one recognises.

17:36.100 --> 17:37.100
Kathy?

17:38.767 --> 17:41.733
Hey, look at you.
What are you thinking?

17:41.867 --> 17:44.233
I need to measure
but it looks the same length
as the other one to me.

17:44.600 --> 17:45.600
Okay.

17:46.367 --> 17:47.800
Which might mean?

17:48.333 --> 17:49.333
Go on.

17:50.167 --> 17:51.500
From the other hand?

17:51.633 --> 17:53.367
To be confirmed but good.

17:58.700 --> 18:00.600
Wait... There's something else.

18:13.800 --> 18:15.967
-Oh, my God.
-It's okay. Take a minute.

18:17.567 --> 18:19.733
Stay with me
and think about this, okay.

18:19.867 --> 18:21.233
This is good.

18:21.367 --> 18:22.700
The head has a missing jawbone.

18:22.833 --> 18:25.267
And we already have that.
This is great progress.

18:27.067 --> 18:29.800
This is the best part
of the job. Not the worst.
I promise.

18:31.700 --> 18:33.700
Those riders.
They were angry.

18:33.833 --> 18:35.133
What you thinking?

18:35.267 --> 18:36.567
Could be fuelling
something?

18:37.133 --> 18:38.933
A motive?

18:39.067 --> 18:41.733
Right,
what have we got?

18:41.867 --> 18:43.267
Well, we now know that

18:43.400 --> 18:45.633
just because a rider
has a Dundeats box
on their back,

18:45.767 --> 18:47.200
doesn't mean
he works for Dundeats.

18:49.467 --> 18:51.067
So, now we need a list of every

18:51.133 --> 18:53.833
food delivery rider
in the vicinity of that nail bar

18:53.967 --> 18:55.133
an hour before
that bomb went off.

18:56.200 --> 18:58.400
We've just tripled our suspects.

18:58.533 --> 19:00.500
So, we got a warrant
for the list of patients

19:00.633 --> 19:02.300
on your anti-depressant,
Prazodone.

19:02.433 --> 19:04.600
Please, God.
Tell me it's a short list.

19:04.733 --> 19:06.800
-Nine thousand and fourteen.

19:09.133 --> 19:10.133
What?

19:12.800 --> 19:14.433
Prazodone's supposed to be
atypical.

19:14.567 --> 19:17.067
Compared to your
bog-standard antidepressant,
it is.

19:17.167 --> 19:18.333
Nine thousand?

19:18.733 --> 19:19.767
And 14.

19:23.800 --> 19:26.133
How are we supposed to wade
through this? And fast?

19:26.267 --> 19:28.467
And comparing these names
to what?

19:28.600 --> 19:30.900
We're supposed to be coming up
with a profile here,

19:31.067 --> 19:32.767
not staring into the abyss.

19:32.900 --> 19:35.233
-Results back from the lab.
-Finally.

19:35.367 --> 19:37.067
No prints or DNA on the letter.

19:37.133 --> 19:38.533
-What? Nothing?
-Sorry.

19:40.200 --> 19:41.167
Christ.

19:42.200 --> 19:43.333
How can there be nothing?

19:47.067 --> 19:48.500
Because somebody knows
what they're doing.

19:54.933 --> 19:57.067
It's ruined, isn't it?

19:57.200 --> 20:00.800
There's always a chance.
Once you test for DNA or prints
with a bit of ninhydrin.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.533
Your lab has been
pretty thorough.

20:03.667 --> 20:06.867
There isn't a single stroke
of ink that hasn't been drenched
in the stuff.

20:07.933 --> 20:09.467
I can't do any ink analysis

20:09.600 --> 20:11.300
or ink comparisons
on this letter.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
Sorry.

20:13.967 --> 20:16.033
Oh. Great.

20:17.500 --> 20:18.733
Have you got five minutes?

20:18.867 --> 20:20.500
I just want to show you
something.

20:21.133 --> 20:22.133
Sure.

20:41.567 --> 20:43.000
Come on. You look like
you need a drink.

21:01.067 --> 21:04.367
So, the eyewitnesses,
outside the nail bar,

21:04.500 --> 21:07.400
what they described,
I thought we could see it
for ourselves.

21:28.067 --> 21:29.833
Wait for it.

21:42.300 --> 21:43.300
How's it going?

21:46.233 --> 21:48.500
I'm just drowning in this stuff.

21:48.633 --> 21:50.467
Just...
getting nowhere.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.333
Have you asked for help?

21:52.467 --> 21:54.700
Yeah, but we know
what that means.

21:56.233 --> 21:57.233
Not this time.

21:58.767 --> 21:59.733
What?

22:00.467 --> 22:01.467
You got me.

22:02.667 --> 22:06.733
Da-dah! I am your new master
of data.

22:06.867 --> 22:08.567
You made
the request.

22:08.700 --> 22:10.067
And you got the best.

22:10.200 --> 22:11.200
That's why I'm here.

22:13.367 --> 22:14.367
Wow.

22:15.700 --> 22:17.367
-Really?
-Yes, really.

22:18.633 --> 22:19.833
That's great news.

22:20.833 --> 22:22.700
Brilliant. Wow.

22:22.833 --> 22:24.433
Yay!

22:26.267 --> 22:28.700
So, what about flooding?
Recent flooding?

22:28.833 --> 22:30.300
According to
this local fishing forum,

22:30.433 --> 22:31.933
the levels have remained
the same.

22:33.633 --> 22:36.533
Oh. Wait.
Let me check something.

22:36.667 --> 22:38.067
There was a landslide up top.

22:38.133 --> 22:39.100
Just there.

22:39.233 --> 22:40.900
Above the loch. Near the falls.

22:41.067 --> 22:42.733
The path was blocked
for a few days.

22:42.867 --> 22:44.800
Fishermen loved it.
No walkers for days.

22:45.367 --> 22:46.500
That is good.

22:50.133 --> 22:53.333
The landslide may have caused
floating body parts to move
from A to B.

22:55.200 --> 22:56.800
Okay, I'm turning in.

22:59.067 --> 23:00.100
Er...

23:02.867 --> 23:05.500
It's a big deal.
Your first day in the field.

23:05.633 --> 23:07.967
It's a lot. To see.

23:08.100 --> 23:10.667
And these things have a habit
of creeping up on you.

23:10.800 --> 23:13.767
So, just so you know,
the support is out there.

23:13.900 --> 23:17.833
Counselling. If you need.
And if you feel spooked later,
just give me a knock.

23:19.067 --> 23:20.067
Thanks.

23:20.800 --> 23:21.800
Okay.

23:35.167 --> 23:37.733
Okay, you are not my
pre-arranged bootie call.

23:37.867 --> 23:40.100
I'm sorry.
Just wanted to say hi.

23:41.067 --> 23:42.700
How's it going?

23:42.833 --> 23:46.400
Found a pair of feet. A head.
How about you?

23:46.533 --> 23:47.500
Jeez.

23:47.633 --> 23:48.567
I can't compete with that.

23:48.700 --> 23:50.600
Oh, no need. How's bomb-land?

23:51.600 --> 23:53.233
Fine. Bit scary.

23:53.367 --> 23:55.600
Yeah. You okay?

23:55.733 --> 23:56.667
Neil, okay?

23:56.800 --> 23:58.200
-Yep.

23:58.333 --> 24:00.233
- Oh.
-No, it's just.

24:01.067 --> 24:02.767
I wanted to ask you something.

24:02.900 --> 24:05.433
-Oh shit. Er, bootie-calling.
Got to go! Sorry!

24:11.333 --> 24:13.333
Finally! God!

24:14.567 --> 24:16.100
- Hey.
-Hey.

24:16.233 --> 24:18.667
You look good.

24:18.800 --> 24:21.967
- So do you.
-Oh, I wanted to be post-bath
for this call.

24:22.100 --> 24:23.800
Glistening with skin product but

24:23.933 --> 24:25.933
instead you have me in plaid
and smelling of whisky so.

24:26.367 --> 24:27.367
It's okay.

24:28.233 --> 24:29.967
You packed? Checked in yet?

24:31.800 --> 24:32.833
No.

24:32.967 --> 24:34.900
Oh. Living by
the seat of your pants.

24:35.067 --> 24:36.600
- Kathy.
-Yeah?

24:37.367 --> 24:38.600
I'm not coming on Friday.

24:42.567 --> 24:43.533
What?

24:46.200 --> 24:47.333
I went out last week.

24:48.500 --> 24:49.767
On a date.

24:49.900 --> 24:51.333
Which we said was allowed.

24:53.333 --> 24:54.333
We did.

24:56.233 --> 24:57.367
But...

24:57.500 --> 24:59.767
-You had a nice time. With her.
- Yeah.

25:00.600 --> 25:01.600
I did.

25:02.467 --> 25:04.967
Oh fuck!

25:05.100 --> 25:07.133
- I'm sorry.
-No, I mean, you

25:07.900 --> 25:09.200
do what you want.

25:11.100 --> 25:12.300
You sound...

25:12.433 --> 25:13.967
I'm fine.

25:14.100 --> 25:15.700
-It's okay.
- Is it?

25:15.833 --> 25:17.933
Yeah. It was just a holiday.

25:18.067 --> 25:20.567
Friends, hanging out.
Bit of fun.

25:20.700 --> 25:23.100
Maybe a bit of making out
for old times' sake.

25:23.233 --> 25:25.800
No strings. Or pressure.
That's all.

25:25.933 --> 25:27.533
It, it really is fine.

25:32.067 --> 25:33.067
Okay.

25:34.967 --> 25:36.067
Good bye then.

25:36.633 --> 25:38.800
Okay. Okay. Bye.

26:39.733 --> 26:41.567
Kathy? Are you awake?

26:44.200 --> 26:45.400
I did get a little spooked.

26:49.533 --> 26:51.133
I'm sorry to bother you.

26:51.267 --> 26:52.633
But you said to knock, so...

26:58.100 --> 26:59.100
Kathy?

27:04.700 --> 27:06.733
Kathy? Are you Okay?

27:08.100 --> 27:10.633
Kathy? Kathy?

27:22.400 --> 27:23.367
Shit.

27:27.133 --> 27:28.133
Kathy.

27:28.700 --> 27:29.700
Kathy.

27:31.100 --> 27:32.133
Shit.

27:38.200 --> 27:39.867
-What the...
-Good job.

27:40.067 --> 27:41.633
-Think she's fine.

27:41.767 --> 27:43.600
Yeah. Yeah she is.

27:43.733 --> 27:46.100
-I'll...
-Why am I wet?

27:46.233 --> 27:47.800
What's that in my ear?

27:49.400 --> 27:50.567
I was worried
you were a bit... dead.

27:52.267 --> 27:53.500
I thought, God, not you too.

27:58.633 --> 27:59.667
That was quite a night cap.

28:00.567 --> 28:01.567
How many have you taken?

28:02.967 --> 28:04.067
What are you doing here?

28:05.733 --> 28:07.133
Couldn't sleep.

28:07.267 --> 28:08.400
Kept thinking about the head.

28:09.933 --> 28:12.400
Tried to knock,
but there was no answer.

28:12.533 --> 28:14.300
You should try
Diazepam and whisky.

28:14.433 --> 28:15.533
It's a good combo.

28:16.633 --> 28:18.467
You couldn't sleep either?

28:18.600 --> 28:20.967
Just a little bit
of hyperventilation.

28:22.567 --> 28:24.433
My friend erm...

28:25.467 --> 28:27.467
-Pia?
-Pia,

28:31.067 --> 28:33.133
Pia's got a new sweetie.
And she's not me and

28:36.400 --> 28:37.567
I'm an old sweetie.

28:40.233 --> 28:41.467
An old,

28:42.533 --> 28:43.733
old sweetie.

29:43.767 --> 29:45.367
Hey, you.

29:45.500 --> 29:47.500
Oh my God, how are you feeling?

29:47.633 --> 29:49.067
I hope you had breakfast.

29:49.167 --> 29:51.433
You need protein
after that kind of night.

29:51.567 --> 29:53.567
Eggs, particularly,
are like a panacea...

29:53.700 --> 29:56.233
You need your waders.
Quick as you can.
We've got a lot to do.

30:06.833 --> 30:09.800
-Sarah.
-I might have something for you.

30:09.933 --> 30:12.233
Ah, music to my ears.

30:12.367 --> 30:14.867
I've been testing the residue
on the curved glass fragments

30:15.000 --> 30:16.767
from the jar
containing the bomb.

30:16.900 --> 30:19.333
Some of it came back
as traces of potassium chlorate.

30:19.467 --> 30:21.700
Some were condom.
But there was another mark.

30:21.833 --> 30:23.600
-Go on.
- It's ink.

30:23.733 --> 30:25.900
-Black ink.
- What?

30:26.033 --> 30:28.733
It's the same kind of ink
as was used on the black pill

30:28.867 --> 30:31.800
- and to write hashtag one.
-It's incredible.

30:31.933 --> 30:33.833
- I'll keep you posted.
-Brilliant.

30:34.600 --> 30:37.300
Oh, er,

30:37.433 --> 30:40.767
some good news.
Er, Azra's on board.

30:40.900 --> 30:46.233
The case. Er, she's taking over
all the data analysis.
Officially.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
Be working with us.

30:49.400 --> 30:52.100
That's great. That's...

30:52.233 --> 30:54.800
That's great. Azra. Of course.

30:56.667 --> 30:57.667
Just what you need.

30:59.233 --> 31:03.367
Still missing. Number one.
Torso. Then, hips

31:03.500 --> 31:05.867
and all of the upper limbs.

31:06.067 --> 31:08.667
Why are they
always males?
Who go missing out here?

31:08.800 --> 31:11.267
Women start low
and work their way up.

31:11.400 --> 31:14.633
Men start high.
Full of expectation and promise.

31:14.767 --> 31:16.733
But there's only one way to go.
It's just how it is.

31:19.067 --> 31:20.967
Easy.

31:21.100 --> 31:22.900
Let's go find
where the landslide started.

31:43.633 --> 31:44.633
Don't touch anything.

31:45.900 --> 31:47.400
You think
this has something to do with...

31:47.533 --> 31:50.467
Yeah. Well, the growth
around the tent
kind of makes sense.

31:50.600 --> 31:52.400
Obviously, the water levels
would have been much higher,

31:52.533 --> 31:54.667
so if the body went in here,

31:54.800 --> 31:57.733
it would have travelled
downstream and eventually
reached the loch.

32:01.467 --> 32:02.767
Let's keep going downstream.

32:08.100 --> 32:11.367
We pretty much know
what the timeline is here. Safi.

32:11.500 --> 32:15.400
Father Nkusi has had
his fair share of hate messages.
Listen to this.

32:15.533 --> 32:18.200
"I'm no Ladybird".
That's the username.

32:18.333 --> 32:20.567
"I don't want no Google
in my community centre".

32:23.767 --> 32:26.433
It's a thing.
You know trolls replace
offensive languages

32:26.567 --> 32:28.133
Common words
to bypass the blocking.

32:29.067 --> 32:30.800
It's abusive code.

32:30.933 --> 32:33.167
Lady Bird Johnson
was Lyndon Johnson's wife.

32:33.300 --> 32:35.467
She discouraged
the use of the N-word.

32:35.600 --> 32:37.733
Campaigned for the end
of segregation. So...

32:37.867 --> 32:41.067
-"I'm no Ladybird". Christ.
-Yeah.

32:41.167 --> 32:43.100
"I'm not in favour
of civil rights". Basically.

32:45.800 --> 32:48.067
Hey, look at this.

32:48.167 --> 32:50.533
This looks the same as the one
sent to the Dundee Times.

32:52.767 --> 32:53.800
Go and get the Super. Look.

32:54.567 --> 32:55.567
Look.

33:26.133 --> 33:28.100
Same handwriting as the first
on the envelope.

33:28.233 --> 33:29.967
But look at the letter.

33:30.100 --> 33:31.200
The writing's
completely different.

33:32.433 --> 33:33.700
This isn't a lone bomber.

33:33.833 --> 33:35.833
-So, we're back to a group?
-Maybe.

33:35.967 --> 33:37.400
- Dundee Times got anything?
-They said not.

33:37.533 --> 33:39.067
No. So, this one's just for us.

33:40.067 --> 33:41.300
Pages this time.

33:41.433 --> 33:43.467
Full of racist vitriol.
Eugenics.

33:44.700 --> 33:45.800
Purity of white skin.

33:47.633 --> 33:49.567
Get this tested.
Rush it through.

33:49.700 --> 33:51.867
Tell our lab
not to not to drench it
in ninhydrin this time.

33:52.067 --> 33:54.233
Then we can get it over to Sarah
for ink analysis

33:54.367 --> 33:55.367
Boss.

34:18.400 --> 34:19.400
Get Charlie.

34:43.900 --> 34:44.900
There we have it.

34:51.767 --> 34:54.133
Hash tag two's
written on the bomb

34:54.267 --> 34:56.067
The bomber's telling us
it's a campaign.

34:56.167 --> 34:57.367
There's going to be
a third bomb.

36:01.200 --> 36:02.200
Safi?

36:08.867 --> 36:12.900
So apparently
the police are being helped out
by some top scientists at SIFA.

36:13.067 --> 36:15.833
The Scottish Institute
for Forensics, or whatever.

36:15.967 --> 36:18.267
And they are still
getting no where

36:18.400 --> 36:21.100
finding out who is behind
these two bombs in Dundee.

36:21.233 --> 36:23.200
Guys, what is going on here?

36:23.333 --> 36:24.567
How hard can it be?

36:24.700 --> 36:26.800
Folk's, I'd love to get
your thoughts on this.

36:26.933 --> 36:29.800
You know the numbers,
you know the socials.
You have got my email.

36:29.933 --> 36:31.433
Please let us know
your thoughts,

36:31.567 --> 36:32.900
this show is about you.

36:43.067 --> 36:45.600
Because chemistry tends to be
very male-dominated,

36:45.733 --> 36:48.267
we as female professors
of forensic science,

36:48.400 --> 36:50.067
we're out
on a strange group anyway.

36:50.133 --> 36:53.300
I mean, I'm considered
one of those funny people
that blows things up

36:53.433 --> 36:55.567
and sets fire to things
and works with drugs,

36:55.700 --> 36:57.667
and female as well.

37:17.900 --> 37:20.300
So, which head owns the feet?

37:20.433 --> 37:22.867
No idea. Mortuary day
will sort that out.

37:28.500 --> 37:31.733
Hey, I don't mind,
talking some more, you know.

37:32.733 --> 37:33.900
What?

37:34.067 --> 37:35.067
We're not at work now.

37:35.833 --> 37:37.533
You and Pia.

37:37.667 --> 37:39.567
I'm happy
to be a sounding board.

37:39.700 --> 37:41.600
It must have been a real shock.
You know.

37:41.733 --> 37:42.733
If she was special.

37:45.800 --> 37:48.267
I was very tired last night.
It was a long day.

37:50.067 --> 37:51.067
Nothing else to say.

39:15.200 --> 39:17.467
Thank you. I had a good time.

39:17.600 --> 39:20.567
It was lively.
Even by my standards.

39:21.600 --> 39:24.333
Want to come in?
A drink? Coffee?

39:24.467 --> 39:27.600
I'm late picking up my dogs.
I'll see you tomorrow, Erika.

39:35.600 --> 39:37.200
Boss? That was the lab.

39:37.333 --> 39:39.400
We've got DNA from the envelope
of the second letter

39:39.533 --> 39:40.667
and a name and address.

39:42.433 --> 39:46.833
Yes! Come on.

39:46.967 --> 39:50.167
Anthony Gemmell.
Arrested in 2018

39:50.300 --> 39:54.467
for putting stickers
around Dundee, saying
"Diversity is White Genocide".

39:54.600 --> 39:56.133
Went to court but got off.

39:56.267 --> 39:59.167
Was convicted again
for spitting on a police woman

39:59.300 --> 40:01.267
at an alt-right march in 2019.

40:01.767 --> 40:02.733
Great.

40:19.033 --> 40:22.400
Gemmell is retired.
Used to manage
an electrical showroom.

40:22.533 --> 40:24.933
His wife,
Valerie was a Latin teacher,

40:25.067 --> 40:26.200
now also retired.

41:03.900 --> 41:06.067
-Nothing.

41:06.600 --> 41:07.600
Back door.

41:13.367 --> 41:14.700
Thanks,
just going to see Jo.

41:58.200 --> 41:59.233
Out you go.

42:32.267 --> 42:33.267
Cheers.

42:47.067 --> 42:48.900
Hey Kitty, where are you?
Hurry up.
