00:17.867 --> 00:19.933
YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS
GARGLING THERE ?

00:19.967 --> 00:21.333

DOODLE DANDY" ?

00:21.367 --> 00:22.433
YES.

00:22.467 --> 00:23.500
THAT WAS
A GOOD ONE.

00:23.533 --> 00:24.567
GOOD GUESS.

00:24.600 --> 00:25.867
YEAH, THAT WAS
PRETTY CLEAR.

00:37.767 --> 00:38.833
OH, REALLY ?

00:38.867 --> 00:43.300

GET RID OF HIM.

00:43.333 --> 00:44.433

00:44.467 --> 00:45.467
HE'S A LINGERER.

00:45.500 --> 00:46.600
OKAY.

00:46.633 --> 00:49.600
I'M A MALINGERER
AND HE'S A LINGERER.

00:49.633 --> 00:51.033
ALRIGHT, SO WE'LL
GO OUT THURSDAY.

00:51.067 --> 00:53.933
OKAY, AND ALSO,
THIS IS A LITTLE WEIRD,

00:53.967 --> 00:59.367
JEFF WANTS TO SEE US
IN HIS OFFICE TOMORROW.

00:59.400 --> 01:00.433
HE WANTS
TO SEE US ?

01:00.467 --> 01:02.567
YOU AND ME,

01:02.600 --> 01:04.633
HE SAID NOT TO WORRY,
HE SAID HE'S GOT GOOD NEWS.

01:04.667 --> 01:05.900
OH, BROTHER.

01:05.933 --> 01:07.267
BUT, I COULDN'T
GET IT OUT OF HIM.

01:07.300 --> 01:08.367
ALRIGHT.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.500
I WONDER WHAT
THE GOOD NEWS IS.

01:10.533 --> 01:12.767
I DON'T KNOW, I CAN'T
EVEN BEGIN TO IMAGINE.

01:12.800 --> 01:14.433
HE'S LEAVING
SHOW BUSINESS ?

01:14.467 --> 01:16.433
THAT WOULD BE
GOOD NEWS.

01:16.467 --> 01:18.800
ALTHOUGH I DON'T THINK
HE'D BILL IT AS THAT.

01:26.733 --> 01:27.800
GOODNIGHT.

01:27.833 --> 01:29.533
GOODNIGHT.

01:37.733 --> 01:39.333
CAN I ASK YOU
SOMETHING ?

01:39.367 --> 01:40.367
SURE.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.700
I'M JUST
CURIOUS, OKAY ?

01:42.733 --> 01:48.300
WHY AM I THE ONE THAT ALWAYS
HAS TO INITIATE SEX ?

01:48.333 --> 01:50.067
YOU EVER THOUGHT
ABOUT THAT ?

01:53.800 --> 01:55.933
UM...

01:55.967 --> 01:58.733
OKAY, I'LL
TELL YOU WHY.

01:58.767 --> 02:01.200
I GOT A CRAMP
IN MY FOOT.

02:01.233 --> 02:05.967
UM, I'M AVAILABLE
FOR SEX ALL THE TIME.

02:06.067 --> 02:07.433
IS THAT RIGHT ?

02:07.467 --> 02:08.867
BASICALLY.

02:08.900 --> 02:11.967
SO, ANYTIME YOU
WANNA HAVE IT,

02:12.067 --> 02:13.633
YOU CAN HAVE IT.

02:13.667 --> 02:14.800
WOW !

02:14.833 --> 02:16.900
BUT, ANYTIME I WANNA
HAVE IT, I CAN'T.

02:16.933 --> 02:18.833
SO, JUST ASSUME THAT
I WANT IT ALL THE TIME,

02:18.867 --> 02:21.400
SO, WHENEVER YOU WANT IT,
JUST TAP ME ON THE SHOULDER.

02:21.433 --> 02:25.567
OH, JESUS, THAT'S SO
NOT HOW IT SHOULD GO.

02:25.600 --> 02:27.200
WELL, OTHERWISE I'LL BE
MAKING MOVES ALL THE TIME.

02:27.233 --> 02:28.467
DO YOU WANT THAT ?

02:28.500 --> 02:30.067
DO YOU WANT SOMEBODY JUST
MAULING YOU ALL THE TIME ?

02:30.100 --> 02:33.533
I WILL TREAT YOUR BREASTS
AS IF THEY'RE MINE.

02:33.567 --> 02:35.300
ONCE IN A WHILE.

02:35.333 --> 02:36.467
I DON'T WANT YOU
WALKING AROUND LIKE THAT.

02:36.500 --> 02:40.100
THAT'S HOW
I'LL WALK AROUND...

02:40.133 --> 02:42.900
YOU KNOW,
I NEED BORDERS,

02:42.933 --> 02:43.967
I NEED BOUNDARIES.

02:44.067 --> 02:46.267
OKAY, ONCE IN A WHILE,
GIVE IT A TRY,

02:46.300 --> 02:48.500
THAT'S ALL
I'M SAYING, OKAY ?

02:48.533 --> 02:49.933
ALRIGHT, WELL,
OKAY, ALRIGHT.

02:49.967 --> 02:52.167
NOT, NOT, NOW,
NO, NOT NOW.

02:56.100 --> 02:58.067
SO, WHAT'S
THE DEAL HERE ?

02:58.067 --> 02:59.467
WHY'D YOU CALL US
DOWN HERE FOR ?

02:59.500 --> 03:00.967
THIS IS VERY EXCITING,

03:01.067 --> 03:02.933
I KNOW YOU'RE BUSY
WITH YOUR CHARITY WORK

03:02.967 --> 03:05.600
AND ALL THAT STUFF,
BUT, I GOT A PHONE CALL

03:05.633 --> 03:07.200

03:07.233 --> 03:08.633
YOU KNOW WHO
WENDY PRAEGER IS ?

03:08.667 --> 03:09.967
YEAH, DIRECTOR, RIGHT ?

03:10.067 --> 03:11.133
WELL, DIRECTOR...

03:11.167 --> 03:13.367
THEATER DIRECTOR.

03:13.400 --> 03:15.633
SHE'S DIRECTING

03:15.667 --> 03:16.800
THAT SHOW,
IN NEW YORK,

03:16.833 --> 03:19.333

"THE VAGINA MONOLOGUES"

03:19.367 --> 03:21.067

03:25.467 --> 03:29.067
"SHE'S BRINGING
"THE VAGINA MONOLOGUES"...

03:29.067 --> 03:31.300
GOOD FOR YOU, WENDY,
DO YOU NEED HELP ?

03:31.333 --> 03:32.433
SHE DOES, ACTUALLY,

03:32.467 --> 03:33.900
'CAUSE ONE OF HER
ACTRESSES DROPPED OUT

03:33.933 --> 03:35.133
AND I SUGGESTED YOU.

03:35.167 --> 03:37.300
( Cheryl )
ARE YOU KIDDING ?

03:37.333 --> 03:38.833
NO, NO AUDITION.

03:38.867 --> 03:40.867
SHE HAD SEEN YOU
IN A PLAY YEARS AGO.

03:40.900 --> 03:44.233
AND, KNEW WHO YOU WERE
AND LIKED YOUR WORK.

03:44.267 --> 03:46.433
ARE YOU
JOKING ME ?

03:46.467 --> 03:48.067
NO, I'M NOT,
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

03:48.067 --> 03:49.400
I HAVE THE SCRIPT
RIGHT HERE.

03:49.433 --> 03:52.933
SHE WANTS CHERYL TO DO
"THE VAGINA MONOLOGUES" ?

03:52.967 --> 03:55.500
YES, THE ONLY THING IS
IT'S OPENING IN A WEEK,

03:55.533 --> 03:57.133
BUT, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO LEARN ANY LINES,

03:57.167 --> 03:58.833
YOU CAN USE
THE SCRIPT ON STAGE.

03:58.867 --> 04:00.067
SERIOUSLY.

04:00.067 --> 04:01.633
( Cheryl stammering )

04:01.667 --> 04:02.867
I'VE NEVER SEEN HER
SO SPEECHLESS BEFORE.

04:02.900 --> 04:05.367
I AM SHOCKED,
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

04:05.400 --> 04:07.067
I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE
TO SELL YOU TO HER.

04:07.100 --> 04:08.700
NANCY JUST SAW THIS
IN NEW YORK

04:08.733 --> 04:10.400
AND SAID THAT IT'S LIKE
THE BIGGEST HIT.

04:10.433 --> 04:12.467
YOUR INVOLVED WITH
"THE VAGINA MONOLOGUES".

04:12.500 --> 04:14.833
( Larry )
OF COURSE, YOU KNOW,
I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY SEEN

04:14.867 --> 04:16.900
THE VAGINA WITH
MY GLASSES ON.

04:16.933 --> 04:18.433
I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY
IDEA WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE,

04:18.467 --> 04:20.300
IT'S ALL A HAZY
MYSTERY TO ME.

04:20.333 --> 04:22.200
YEAH, YOU DON'T NEED
TO LOOK AT IT UP CLOSE.

04:22.233 --> 04:23.567
HEY, I'M PRO VAGINA.

04:23.600 --> 04:24.933
I CAN'T WAIT
TO READ THIS,

04:24.967 --> 04:27.767
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
TO SAY TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

04:27.800 --> 04:28.967
CAN I HAVE HER CALL
YOU THIS AFTERNOON,

04:29.067 --> 04:31.633
PLEASE, YES.
IS THAT COOL ?

04:31.667 --> 04:33.367
YOU'RE WELCOME.
THANK YOU.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.100
( Cheryl )
THAT WAS SO NICE.

04:35.133 --> 04:36.400
WASN'T THAT

04:36.433 --> 04:38.233
I'M SHOCKED.

04:38.267 --> 04:39.733
I'D LIKE TO
DO SOMETHING
NICE FOR HIM.

04:39.767 --> 04:41.167
YOU REALLY SHOULD
GET HIM SOMETHING.

04:41.200 --> 04:44.333
YOU COULD GET HIM
A BOTTLE OF SCOTCH
OR SOMETHING.

04:44.367 --> 04:46.867
JOHNNY, UH,
JOHNNY GOLDBERG.

04:46.900 --> 04:48.433

05:02.300 --> 05:03.700

05:11.200 --> 05:15.333
SO, ARE YOU WORKING,

05:15.367 --> 05:18.567
I'M ON DRUGS, YOU KNOW,
I'M ALL DOPED UP,

05:18.600 --> 05:20.233
I DON'T DO
ANYTHING, YEAH.

05:20.267 --> 05:22.333
IT'S TRUE,
I'M A DRUG ADDICT NOW.

05:22.367 --> 05:24.067
WELL, I'M GLAD
I'M SEEING YOU,

05:24.067 --> 05:25.567
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN

05:32.600 --> 05:33.567
SOMETIMES.

05:33.600 --> 05:34.600

05:34.633 --> 05:36.267
YEAH, YEAH.

05:36.300 --> 05:37.867

05:37.900 --> 05:41.600
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO
GET A READING FOR THAT,

05:41.633 --> 05:43.933
AND MY AGENT'S
JUST DROPPED THE BALL.

05:43.967 --> 05:46.067
OH, I JUST
GOT LUCKY,

05:46.100 --> 05:48.600
AND, HIS MANAGER
REALLY WAS HELPFUL.

05:48.633 --> 05:50.633
YEAH, WELL, GREAT !

05:50.667 --> 05:51.900
SO, IT'S NICE

05:54.233 --> 05:56.967
WELL, WE USED
TO GO OUT.

05:57.067 --> 05:57.967
BUT, SHE DIDN'T
LIKE ME VERY MUCH.

05:58.067 --> 06:00.267
I DIDN'T LIKE
HIM VERY MUCH, NO.

06:00.300 --> 06:01.467
WHEN HE STOPPED
ACTUALLY BEING FUN,

06:01.500 --> 06:03.433
I STOPPED ACTUALLY
LIKING HIM.

06:03.467 --> 06:05.433
GOOD, GOOD.

06:05.467 --> 06:07.800
IT DIDN'T
GO ANYWHERE.

06:07.833 --> 06:09.167
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

06:09.200 --> 06:11.067
I'M GONNA GO
WAIT IN THE CAR.

06:11.100 --> 06:12.767
I'M DYING TO REALLY
START READING THIS.

06:12.800 --> 06:14.333
IT WAS GREAT
MEETING YOU.

06:14.367 --> 06:16.333
OH, AND
CONGRATULATIONS

FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT.

06:25.900 --> 06:27.933
BYE-BYE.

06:27.967 --> 06:30.800

06:34.367 --> 06:35.433
THANK YOU.

06:35.467 --> 06:36.633

I SEE YOU AGAIN.

06:43.967 --> 06:45.133

06:45.167 --> 06:48.800
I'M ACTUALLY REALLY GLAD
THAT I HAVE RUN INTO YOU

06:48.833 --> 06:50.100
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT YOU.

06:50.133 --> 06:51.967
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO
GET IN TOUCH WITH YOU,

06:52.067 --> 06:53.767
AND, I KIND OF WANNA
GET TOGETHER WITH YOU

06:53.800 --> 06:55.333
'CAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING
I'D LIKE TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT.

06:55.367 --> 06:56.367
REALLY ?

06:56.400 --> 06:57.633
TELL ME, RIGHT NOW.

06:57.667 --> 06:58.967
NO, THIS ISN'T
REALLY...

06:59.067 --> 07:00.267
YEAH, IT'S KIND
OF WEIRD.

07:00.300 --> 07:01.867
WE DON'T HAVE
A CHILD, DO WE ?

07:01.900 --> 07:03.067
WELL, NOT THAT
I KNOW OF,

07:03.100 --> 07:05.267
AND, I THINK I'D PROBABLY
BE AWARE OF THAT ONE.

07:05.300 --> 07:07.367
DO YOU HAVE TIME, LARRY ?
COME ON, I'M SERIOUS.

07:07.400 --> 07:09.067
UM, YEAH,
I GUESS, YEAH.

07:09.067 --> 07:10.567
SO, CAN WE,
MAYBE THIS WEEK,

07:10.600 --> 07:12.333
HAVE LUNCH ?

07:12.367 --> 07:14.133
I GUESS I CAN
HAVE LUNCH, YEAH.

07:20.433 --> 07:21.433
GOODNIGHT.

07:21.467 --> 07:22.900
GOODNIGHT.

07:28.833 --> 07:30.733
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING ?

07:30.767 --> 07:32.800
I'M TAPPING YOU
ON THE SHOULDER.

07:32.833 --> 07:34.633
MM, YOU KNOW WHAT ?

07:34.667 --> 07:37.167
I'M REALLY NOT
IN THE MOOD,

07:37.200 --> 07:38.833
TO TELL YOU
THE TRUTH.

07:38.867 --> 07:41.533
IS IT ALRIGHT
IF WE DON'T DO IT ?

07:41.567 --> 07:43.600
I'M SORRY,
IS THAT OKAY ?

07:43.633 --> 07:46.500
YOU'RE NOT IN
THE MOOD TO DO IT ?

07:46.533 --> 07:48.667
UH, NOT REALLY.

07:48.700 --> 07:50.800
I'M SORRY,
IS THAT OKAY ?

07:54.800 --> 07:57.600
SO, EVEN IF YOU
WANTED TO DO IT,

07:57.633 --> 07:58.767
YOU COULDN'T ?

07:58.800 --> 08:00.367
I CAN'T DO IT, YEAH.

08:00.400 --> 08:01.733
WHY CAN'T YOU
DO IT TONIGHT ?

08:01.767 --> 08:03.733
REMEMBER, THE OTHER
NIGHT YOU JUST SAID

08:03.767 --> 08:05.367
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS
TAP YOU ON THE SHOULDER

08:05.400 --> 08:07.067
AND YOU'RE READY.

08:07.100 --> 08:09.633
I'M KIND OF
TAPPED OUT.

08:09.667 --> 08:12.067
TAPPED OUT ?

08:17.300 --> 08:19.967
YOU MEAN...

08:20.067 --> 08:22.200
WHY WOULD
YOU DO THAT ?

08:22.233 --> 08:24.867
I DON'T KNOW,
IT WAS THERE.

08:24.900 --> 08:27.800
I THINK IT'S
A LITTLE INTERESTING

08:27.833 --> 08:31.367
THAT WE JUST RAN
INTO THAT WOMAN, LUCY.

08:31.400 --> 08:32.833
DO YOU THINK
THAT'S A COINCIDENCE ?

08:32.867 --> 08:34.933
WE RAN INTO
THIS WOMAN,

08:34.967 --> 08:36.833
WHO HAPPENS TO HAVE
REALLY LARGE BREASTS,

08:36.867 --> 08:39.300
AND REALLY
BEAUTIFUL...

08:46.733 --> 08:51.333
SO, YOU WERE
THINKING OF

08:51.367 --> 08:53.767
THIS WOMAN LUCY
THE WHOLE TIME YOU WERE--

08:53.800 --> 08:55.133
NO, NOT
THE WHOLE TIME.

08:55.167 --> 08:57.833
SHE MADE A BRIEF APPEARANCE
AND SAID, "GOODBYE".

08:57.867 --> 09:00.767
WAS I
IN THE MIX THERE ?

09:00.800 --> 09:01.767
WHAT, YOU ?

09:01.800 --> 09:02.800
YEAH.

09:02.833 --> 09:04.300
I WOULDN'T DEFILE
YOU LIKE THAT,

09:04.333 --> 09:06.067
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
GOES ON IN THOSE THINGS,

09:06.067 --> 09:07.633
YOU DON'T WANT ANY
PART OF THAT WORLD,

09:07.667 --> 09:09.433
YOU DON'T WANNA BE
INVOLVED IN THAT.

09:09.467 --> 09:11.267
IT'S COMPLIMENTARY
TO YOU,

09:11.300 --> 09:13.233
THAT YOU'RE NOT
INVOLVED IN THAT.

09:13.267 --> 09:14.733
BUT, IT'S A GREAT IDEA

09:14.767 --> 09:15.933
TO BRING YOUR
EX-GIRLFRIENDS IN.

09:15.967 --> 09:18.633
I CAN DEGRADE
AND DEFILE HER.

09:18.667 --> 09:19.833
YOU KNOW,
I HAVE TO SAY...

09:21.700 --> 09:24.333
I'M NOT CRAZY ABOUT
YOU SITTING AROUND

09:24.367 --> 09:26.467
THINKING ABOUT
LUCY MONTONE,
OR OTHER WOMEN,

09:26.500 --> 09:29.200
EX-GIRLFRIENDS
THAT YOU KNOW.

09:29.233 --> 09:30.333
OKAY,
LUCY MONTONE
IS OUT,

09:30.367 --> 09:31.667
SHE'S MADE HER
LAST APPEARANCE.

09:31.700 --> 09:32.800
THAT'S IT.

09:32.833 --> 09:34.533
YEAH, I DIDN'T PARTICULARLY
CARE FOR HER ANYWAY.

09:34.567 --> 09:35.600
IS THAT RIGHT ?

09:35.633 --> 09:36.633
YEAH, SHE'S GOT
A BAD ATTITUDE,

09:36.667 --> 09:38.267
DOES NOT PARTICIPATE
IN THE LESBIAN SCENES,

09:38.300 --> 09:39.467
VERY HARD TO
GET ALONG WITH.

09:39.500 --> 09:41.700
YOU KNOW, SHE'S LIKE
A PRIMA DONNA.

09:41.733 --> 09:43.900
I DON'T NEED ANY
PRIMA DONNAS, YOU KNOW.

09:43.933 --> 09:45.467
YEAH, NO, NO,
EX-GIRLFRIENDS.

09:45.500 --> 09:48.067
NOT LUCY, NOT ANY OF
THE EX-GIRLFRIENDS.

09:48.100 --> 09:50.467
THAT'S FAIR, THAT'S
COMPLETELY LEGITIMATE.

09:50.500 --> 09:53.567
I'M GONNA BRING BACK
THE YOUNG SOPHIA LOREN.

09:53.600 --> 09:54.700
OKAY ?

09:54.733 --> 09:55.733
OKAY.

09:55.767 --> 09:57.067
THE YOUNG
SOPHIA LOREN...

09:57.067 --> 09:58.267
WHO WOULDN'T ?

10:00.500 --> 10:02.333
THIS IS
FROM CHERYL.

10:02.367 --> 10:03.433
WOW.

10:03.467 --> 10:04.567
HMM ?

10:04.600 --> 10:06.033
YEAH.

10:06.067 --> 10:09.667
THAT'S ONE OF THOSE
THINGS YOU GO, "WOW,

10:09.700 --> 10:11.167
BLUE LABEL !"

10:11.200 --> 10:12.200
YOU LIKE THAT ?

10:12.233 --> 10:13.267
THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

10:13.300 --> 10:14.367
YOU DRINK THAT ?

10:14.400 --> 10:15.633
YEAH, OF COURSE.

10:15.667 --> 10:16.700
YEAH, THAT'S
WHAT I THOUGHT.

10:16.733 --> 10:18.267
I'M CALL HER THIS AFTERNOON
AND THANK HER.

10:18.300 --> 10:19.500
DON'T DRINK IT
ALL AT ONCE.

10:19.533 --> 10:21.167
NO, I WON'T
DRINK IT ALL ONCE.

10:21.200 --> 10:22.300
DID THE DIRECTOR
GET A HOLD OF HER ?

10:22.333 --> 10:24.000
YEAH, YEAH, SHE TALKED
TO THE DIRECTOR.

10:24.033 --> 10:25.100
ALRIGHT, COOL.

10:25.133 --> 10:27.233
SO, YOU MEETING YOUR
EX-GIRLFRIEND FOR LUNCH ?

10:27.267 --> 10:28.533
HEY, HERE
SHE IS.

10:28.567 --> 10:29.733
HI, LUCY.

10:29.767 --> 10:30.967
HEY.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.633
FOUND A SPOT
ON THE STREET.

10:32.667 --> 10:33.967
HI, HOW
YOU DOING ?

10:34.000 --> 10:35.067
GOOD, HOW ARE
YOU TODAY ?

10:35.100 --> 10:36.400
THIS IS JEFF GREENE,
MY MANAGER.

10:36.433 --> 10:37.767
HEY, HOW
ARE YOU ?

10:37.800 --> 10:38.933
VERY WELL,
THANKS.

10:38.967 --> 10:40.000
I KNOW YOU.

10:40.033 --> 10:41.167
OH, REALLY ?

10:41.200 --> 10:44.167
YEAH, I SAW YOU IN
THAT HURRICANE MOVIE.

10:44.200 --> 10:45.300
OH, THAT'S SWEET,
BUT I THINK

10:45.333 --> 10:47.467
YOU'RE THINKING
OF JAMIE GERTZ.

10:47.500 --> 10:49.233
( Jeff )
WELL, SHE WAS
IN THE TORNADO.

10:49.267 --> 10:50.367
I DID AN ASTEROID.

10:50.400 --> 10:51.967
ASTEROID,
HURRICANE,
SAME THING.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.833
YOU WERE VERY GOOD.

10:53.867 --> 10:54.833
THANK YOU.

10:54.867 --> 10:56.000
SO ?

10:56.033 --> 10:59.533
WELL, WE'RE GONNA
GO HAVE SOME LUNCH.

10:59.567 --> 11:01.267
( Jeff )
YEAH, I'M
HUNGRY TOO.

11:01.300 --> 11:03.900
WELL, THEY GOT SOME
GOOD PLACES AROUND HERE.

11:03.933 --> 11:06.167
( Jeff )
THEY HAVE GREAT
PLACES AROUND HERE.

11:06.200 --> 11:07.467
THIS IS THE BEST
ONE IN TOWN,

11:07.500 --> 11:10.567
RIGHT HERE,
IT'S THE BEST ONE.

11:10.600 --> 11:12.067
A GOOD LUNCH,
THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO.

11:12.067 --> 11:13.433
( Lucy )
GREAT TO MEET YOU,
ENJOY YOUR LUNCH.

11:13.467 --> 11:15.500
THANK YOU.

11:15.533 --> 11:17.200
WOW.

11:17.233 --> 11:19.567
YOU'RE JUST A BIG
BOWL OF WRONG.

11:19.600 --> 11:21.567
OOH, GOODNIGHT, NURSE !

11:22.867 --> 11:24.333
AND YOU DIDN'T
GO THE THE PROM ?

11:24.367 --> 11:25.900
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THERE WAS A PROM.

11:25.933 --> 11:27.800
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE NEVER
TALKED ABOUT THIS.

11:27.833 --> 11:30.333
I HAD NO IDEA THAT
A PROM EVEN EXISTED.

11:30.367 --> 11:31.333
YOUR PARENTS,
YOUR BROTHER,

11:31.367 --> 11:32.800
DIDN'T ALERT
YOU TO... ?

11:32.833 --> 11:33.900
NO.

11:33.933 --> 11:36.400
YOU'D THINK I WOULD HAVE
HEARD ABOUT IN SCHOOL,

11:36.433 --> 11:37.633
BUT, I DIDN'T.

11:37.667 --> 11:39.333
ANYWAY, WHAT'S
GOING ON ?

11:39.367 --> 11:41.333
I'M VERY CURIOUS
AS TO WHY

11:41.367 --> 11:43.600
YOU INVITED ME
TO LUNCH.

11:43.633 --> 11:46.900
WELL, OKAY, REMEMBER
WHEN WE WERE DATING,

11:46.933 --> 11:48.800
AND I TOLD YOU
ABOUT MY STEPFATHER,

11:48.833 --> 11:50.467
AND, WHAT HAPPENED ?

11:50.500 --> 11:52.367
YUP, YUP.

11:52.400 --> 11:55.967
AND, DID NOT BREATHE
A WORD OF IT TO ANYONE.

11:56.067 --> 11:57.700
GOOD, 'CAUSE YOU'RE
THE ONLY PERSON

11:57.733 --> 11:59.067
I EVER TOLD
ABOUT THAT,

11:59.100 --> 12:00.800
BUT, I KIND OF FEEL
LIKE WHAT HAPPENED,

12:00.833 --> 12:03.400
I FEEL LIKE IT'S
REALLY STARTING TO

12:03.433 --> 12:05.500
EFFECT MY LIFE,
A LOT, NOW.

12:05.533 --> 12:08.100
AND THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED
AN INCEST SURVIVOR GROUP.

12:09.433 --> 12:13.067
SO, I DON'T
WANNA GO ALONE,

12:13.067 --> 12:16.067
AND I WAS
THINKING, MAYBE...

12:19.200 --> 12:21.333
COULD YOU
GO WITH ME ?

12:21.367 --> 12:24.167
DO YOU WANT ME
TO SPELL IT OUT ?

12:24.200 --> 12:25.333
CAN YOU GO WITH
ME LARRY, PLEASE ?

12:25.367 --> 12:27.600
YOU WANT ME TO GO TO
THE INCEST GROUP
WITH YOU ?

12:27.633 --> 12:28.867
YEAH.

12:28.900 --> 12:32.433
WHAT WOULD
I DO THERE ?

12:32.467 --> 12:36.300
YOU'D JUST BE
THERE WITH ME.

12:36.333 --> 12:38.067
THERE'S NOBODY ELSE

12:38.067 --> 12:40.200
YOU FEEL
COMFORTABLE
GOING WITH ?

12:40.233 --> 12:41.267
LARRY, THERE'S
NOBODY ELSE

12:41.300 --> 12:42.700
WHO KNOWS ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED,

12:42.733 --> 12:44.167
EXCEPT FOR,
YOU KNOW, MY STEPDAD.

12:44.200 --> 12:45.633
I'M CERTAINLY NOT
GONNA BRING HIM.

12:45.667 --> 12:47.967
ARE YOU SURE THAT YOU QUALIFY
WITH YOUR STEPFATHER,

12:48.067 --> 12:49.300
IS THAT CONSIDERED INCEST ?

12:49.333 --> 12:51.433
GOD, LARRY !

12:51.467 --> 12:53.367
NO, IF IT'S YOUR
STEPFATHER, LARRY,

12:53.400 --> 12:54.733
IT'S CONSIDERED
A DATE !

12:54.767 --> 12:57.800
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT
TO YOUR ORDEAL, BUT...

12:57.833 --> 13:00.467
I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF THEY CONSIDER

13:00.500 --> 13:02.133
THAT INCEST
OR NOT.

13:02.167 --> 13:03.900
SO, I GUESS IT'S
A LEGITIMATE QUESTION,

13:03.933 --> 13:05.400
BUT, THE ANSWER
IS, "YES",

13:05.433 --> 13:06.600
THEY CONSIDER
THAT INCEST.

13:06.633 --> 13:09.700
IF YOU DON'T WANNA GO,
I'M NOT GONNA MAKE YOU DO IT.

13:09.733 --> 13:11.167
I'LL GO, YEAH.

13:11.200 --> 13:12.167
ARE YOU COMFORTABLE
WITH THAT ?

13:12.200 --> 13:14.167
I WANT YOU TO
BE COMFORTABLE,

13:14.200 --> 13:16.500
I WANT YOU TO BE
OKAY, SO...

13:22.133 --> 13:24.200
UH, HI.

13:24.233 --> 13:26.067
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE ?

13:26.100 --> 13:27.767
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
WERE GONNA BE HERE.

13:27.800 --> 13:30.567
WELL, SOMETIMES WHEN
WE'RE NOT TOGETHER,

13:30.600 --> 13:32.333
I GO TO RESTAURANTS.

13:32.367 --> 13:35.467
I GUESS WE'RE
ALL HERE.

13:35.500 --> 13:36.767
( Cheryl )
HI...

13:36.800 --> 13:38.800
( Larry )
YEAH, YOU REMEMBER
HER FROM...

13:38.833 --> 13:40.400
AND THAT'S
NANCY.

13:40.433 --> 13:41.967
LUCY, HI, NICE
TO MEET YOU.

13:42.067 --> 13:43.433
NANCY'S A FRIEND

13:46.800 --> 13:48.600
SO, WHAT'S
GOING ON ?

13:48.633 --> 13:49.967
JUST A
LITTLE LUNCH.

13:50.067 --> 13:52.567
DO YOU WANNA
SIT DOWN...

13:52.600 --> 13:54.367
OH, NO, NO, NO.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.233
SIT, SIT, WHY
DON'T YOU SIT ?

13:56.267 --> 13:57.333
NO, NO, NO...

13:57.367 --> 14:00.600
WE NEED OUR
TIME ALONE.

14:00.633 --> 14:02.933
WE'RE GONNA
GO EAT.

14:02.967 --> 14:05.933
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

14:05.967 --> 14:07.267
AND YOU.

14:07.300 --> 14:08.433
IT WAS GREAT
TO SEE YOU,

14:08.467 --> 14:10.100
I KNEW I'D SEE
YOU AGAIN.

14:10.133 --> 14:11.967
YEAH, IT WAS
NICE TO MEET YOU.

14:12.067 --> 14:13.067
NICE TO
MEET YOU.

14:13.067 --> 14:14.200

14:33.567 --> 14:34.900
UH-UH.

14:34.933 --> 14:35.967
NO ?

14:36.067 --> 14:37.667
IS SHE GOING OUT
WITH ANYBODY ?

14:37.700 --> 14:41.400
HEY, YOU GOT
HER NUMBER,

14:41.433 --> 14:42.500
BY SOME CHANCE ?

14:42.533 --> 14:43.967
WHAT DO YOU WANT
HER NUMBER FOR ?

14:44.067 --> 14:46.267
UH, JUST,
REPRESENTATION STUFF.

14:48.600 --> 14:50.767

WORKING WITH HER.

14:50.800 --> 14:52.067
SO, YOU WANNA

14:52.067 --> 14:53.333
I UNDERSTAND.

YOU KNOW WHAT ?

15:01.167 --> 15:02.167
JUST LEAVE IT

15:02.200 --> 15:05.267
OKAY, I'LL LEAVE IT

THANK YOU, VERY MUCH,

15:44.667 --> 15:46.600
AND IF WE COULD,
RIGHT NOW,

15:46.633 --> 15:48.333
PUT OUR HANDS TOGETHER,

16:28.400 --> 16:32.500
MY FIRST PERPETRATOR
WAS MY GRANDFATHER,

16:32.533 --> 16:35.967
WHO'S A VERY DASHING,
HANDSOME MAN.

16:36.067 --> 16:37.933
HE LOOKED LIKE
TYRONE POWER.

16:37.967 --> 16:41.833
HE WOULD COME INTO
MY ROOM WEARING A MASK

16:41.867 --> 16:45.200
AND WE WOULD PLAY
ZORRO AND CONSUELO

16:45.233 --> 16:49.433
AND HE WOULD MAKE A "Z"
ON MY TUMMY WITH A FEATHER

16:49.467 --> 16:52.833
AND THEN LATER,
WITH HIS SWORD.

16:52.867 --> 16:54.667
( coughing )

16:54.700 --> 16:59.200
THE NEXT INCIDENT WAS
AT A FAMILY REUNION

16:59.233 --> 17:01.567
UP AT OUR HOUSE
IN CASAIC.

17:01.600 --> 17:06.700
THEY HAD LAID OUT
PLATTERS OF GREAT FOOD,

17:06.733 --> 17:08.167
ONE OF WHICH WAS
MY FAVORITE DISH,

17:08.200 --> 17:09.833
AMBROSIA,
YOU KNOW,

17:09.867 --> 17:11.467
THAT FRUIT SALAD
WITH THE MARSHMALLOWS

17:11.500 --> 17:13.433
AND THE COCONUT
AND THE CHERRIES.

17:13.467 --> 17:16.967
AND MY UNCLE PETE
ON MY FATHER'S SIDE

17:17.067 --> 17:19.133
AND MY UNCLE NED
ON MY MOTHER'S SIDE

17:19.167 --> 17:22.433
APPROACHED ME AND
TOLD ME THAT

17:22.467 --> 17:24.433
THEY COULD HELP ME
WITH THE RECIPE

17:24.467 --> 17:25.900
AND TEACH ME
HOW TO MAKE IT.

17:25.933 --> 17:27.600
SO THEY TOOK ME
INTO THE HOUSE,

17:27.633 --> 17:29.067
INTO A BACK BEDROOM,

17:29.067 --> 17:32.100
AND, BECAME
OVERLY AVUNCULAR,

17:32.133 --> 17:34.067
WHICH WAS REALLY ODD

17:34.067 --> 17:36.300
BECAUSE THEY NEVER
REALLY GOT ALONG.

17:36.333 --> 17:37.700
AND THEY WERE
EVEN BICKERING

17:37.733 --> 17:39.500
WHILE THEY WERE
HAVING SEX WITH ME,

17:39.533 --> 17:42.167
ARGUING ABOUT WHO WAS
GONNA STAND GUARD

17:42.200 --> 17:44.167
AND POSITIONS
AND TECHNIQUE,

17:44.200 --> 17:47.067
AND, YOU KNOW,
UNDERMINING EACH OTHER,

17:47.100 --> 17:48.833
BERATING EACH OTHER
WHILE THEY WERE DOING IT.

17:51.733 --> 17:53.700
THERE'S ONE MORE EVENT
I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT.

17:53.733 --> 17:55.067
I'M NOT SURE
IF IT COUNTS.

17:55.100 --> 17:58.133
IT WAS MY
STEPBROTHER,

17:58.167 --> 17:59.567
DOES A
STEPBROTHER COUNT ?

17:59.600 --> 18:01.100
IT'S NOT A REALLY
BLOOD RELATIVE.

18:01.133 --> 18:02.767
SO, DOES IT COUNT ?

18:02.800 --> 18:04.667
( Cynthia )
STEP COUNTS.

18:04.700 --> 18:07.600
REMEMBER THAT EVERYBODY,
STEP COUNTS.

18:07.633 --> 18:09.233
( Gwendolyn )
WELL, I THINK THAT
I'LL SAVE IT

18:09.267 --> 18:10.333
FOR ANOTHER MEETING.

18:10.367 --> 18:11.633
I'VE TAKEN UP
A LOT OF TIME.

18:11.667 --> 18:15.100
YOU KNOW, IT
REALLY FEELS GOOD

18:15.133 --> 18:16.467
TO UNBURDEN MYSELF,
YOU KNOW.

18:16.500 --> 18:18.667
THIS MEANS THAT TODAY
I DON'T HAVE TO CUT MYSELF

18:18.700 --> 18:20.567
OR PUT
CIGARETTES OUT...

18:20.600 --> 18:22.333
SO, IT'S, LIKE,

18:22.367 --> 18:25.467
I GO TO VISIT
MY FAMILY,

18:25.500 --> 18:28.200
AND, THEY JUST DENY
MY EXISTENCE, YOU KNOW ?

18:28.233 --> 18:30.600
"YOU'RE NOT THERE,
YOU'RE NOT THERE."

18:30.633 --> 18:32.167
I'M RIGHT HERE !

18:32.200 --> 18:36.067
I WANNA SCREAM AT THEM,
"I'M HERE, I'M HERE... !

18:36.067 --> 18:38.500
I'M HERE !!"

18:40.567 --> 18:42.567
THANKS FOR
LETTING ME SHARE,

18:42.600 --> 18:43.667
THANKS, SO MUCH.

18:43.700 --> 18:45.067
( Cynthia )
THANK YOU,
TRUDY.

18:45.100 --> 18:46.300
THANKS.

18:46.333 --> 18:47.333
THANK YOU.

18:47.367 --> 18:49.067
THANK YOU.

18:49.067 --> 18:50.733
OKAY, NEXT.

18:54.233 --> 18:56.233
YOU'RE UP.

18:56.267 --> 18:58.500
GO AHEAD.

19:15.800 --> 19:17.867
MY NAME IS TODD,

19:17.900 --> 19:20.533
AND, I'M AN
INCEST SURVIVOR.

19:20.567 --> 19:23.467
HI, TODD.
HI, TODD.

19:23.500 --> 19:26.300
HELLO.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.400
I HAD SEX
WITH MY UNCLE,

19:28.433 --> 19:30.067
WHEN I WAS TWELVE.

19:31.867 --> 19:33.700
HE LIVED
IN GREAT NECK.

19:35.300 --> 19:38.133
HE WAS A DOCTOR,
AN OSTEOPATH.

19:40.267 --> 19:42.100
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THEY DO,

19:42.133 --> 19:44.567
BUT, I KNOW
THEY'RE DOCTORS.

19:44.600 --> 19:47.667
IT'S SOMETHING TO DO
WITH MUSCLES, I THINK.

19:47.700 --> 19:50.567
THAT'S NEITHER HERE
NOR THERE, REALLY.

19:53.367 --> 19:55.600
I TOLD YOU I WAS GONNA
HAVE LUNCH WITH HER.

19:55.633 --> 19:56.867
I KNOW.

19:56.900 --> 19:58.267
IT'S SO DIFFERENT
TO WALK IN

19:58.300 --> 20:00.233
AND ACTUALLY SEE
YOU GUYS TOGETHER.

20:00.267 --> 20:01.233
HEY, IF I LIKE
HER SO MUCH,

20:01.267 --> 20:02.667
HOW COME
I BROKE UP
WITH HER ?

20:02.700 --> 20:05.233
YOU BROKE UP
WITH HER ?

20:05.267 --> 20:07.267
OH, RIGHT, YES,

20:07.300 --> 20:08.633
I KNOW THAT'S
IMPOSSIBLE,

20:08.667 --> 20:09.700
FOR AN IDIOT
LIKE ME

20:09.733 --> 20:11.533
TO EVER BREAK UP
WITH A WOMAN.

20:11.567 --> 20:13.167
WELL, IT JUST
SEEMS LIKE...

20:13.200 --> 20:15.667
FINE, YOU CAN GO BACK
TO YOUR "VAGINA MONOLOGUES",

20:15.700 --> 20:16.767
THANK YOU.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.767
OH, SPEAKING OF,

20:18.800 --> 20:20.600
I'M SUPPOSED TO
MEET THE DIRECTOR
TOMORROW AT 11:30.

20:20.633 --> 20:21.733
I BROKE UP
WITH HER.

20:21.767 --> 20:22.900
THAT'S GREAT.

20:22.933 --> 20:25.400
WELL, IT JUST
DOESN'T SEEM...

20:25.433 --> 20:26.833
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE, YEAH.

20:26.867 --> 20:28.200
I'M NOT SAYING
IMPOSSIBLE.

20:28.233 --> 20:30.000
OKAY, SO, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
MEET THE DIRECTOR TOMORROW.

20:30.033 --> 20:31.767
I DON'T HAVE
THE CAR.

20:31.800 --> 20:33.600
OH, WOULD YOU
LIKE A RIDE ?

20:33.633 --> 20:34.967
MM-HMM.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.367
YEAH, I'LL GIVE
YOU A RIDE.

20:36.400 --> 20:37.467
THANK YOU.

20:37.500 --> 20:38.467
YOU'RE WELCOME.

20:40.033 --> 20:43.100
LISTEN TO THIS,
I SAY, "YOU LOOK GREAT.

20:43.133 --> 20:45.000
"AND SHE SAYS,
SO DO YOU.

20:45.033 --> 20:46.567
"I SAY, BUT,
I ONLY HAVE

20:46.600 --> 20:48.767
"THIS WHITE COTTON BRA
AND UNDERPANTS.

20:48.800 --> 20:50.700
"THEN SHE UNDRESSES
ME SLOWLY.

20:50.733 --> 20:52.867
"THE ALCOHOL HAS
GONE TO MY HEAD

20:52.900 --> 20:54.933
"AND I'M LOOSE
AND READY.

20:54.967 --> 20:57.767
"SHE GENTLY AND SLOWLY
LAYS ME OUT ON THE BED

20:57.800 --> 21:02.200
"AND JUST OUR BODIES
RUBBING MAKES ME COME.

21:02.233 --> 21:05.100
"THEN SHE DOES EVERYTHING
TO ME AND MY VAGINA

21:05.133 --> 21:07.067
"THAT I ALWAYS THOUGHT
WAS NASTY BEFORE,

21:07.067 --> 21:10.767
"AND, WOW,
I'M SO HOT,

21:10.800 --> 21:13.067
SO WILD."

21:13.100 --> 21:14.433
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

21:14.467 --> 21:15.600
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WHAT AM I DOING ?

21:15.633 --> 21:16.767
I'M INITIATING.

21:16.800 --> 21:18.500
NO, NO, NO, LISTEN,
I'VE GOT TO READ THIS

21:18.533 --> 21:20.067
BEFORE I MEET THIS
WOMAN TOMORROW.

21:20.067 --> 21:21.800
COME ON, GIVE ME
FIVE MINUTES.

21:21.833 --> 21:25.567
NO, I AM IN
THE MIDDLE OF THIS !

21:25.600 --> 21:26.600
TWO MINUTES
AND WE'LL BE DONE.

21:26.633 --> 21:28.333
WHY WOULD I ?

21:28.367 --> 21:30.100
"AFTERWARD, THE GORGEOUS LADY
TEACHES ME EVERYTHING

21:30.133 --> 21:31.567
"ABOUT MY VAGINA.

21:31.600 --> 21:34.433
"SHE MAKES ME PLAY WITH
MYSELF IN FRONT OF HER

21:34.467 --> 21:36.367
"AND SHE TELLS ME
TO ALWAYS KNOW HOW

21:36.400 --> 21:38.133
"TO GIVE MYSELF PLEASURE,

21:38.167 --> 21:40.567
SO I'LL NEVER NEED
TO RELY ON A MAN."

21:46.300 --> 21:49.400
IF THEY TOOK
ALL THE PILLOWS AWAY,

21:49.433 --> 21:51.067
THERE WAS NO MORE
PILLOWS IN THE WORLD,

21:51.067 --> 21:52.667
DO YOU THINK
THAT WOULD

21:52.700 --> 21:54.900
AFFECT YOU
ADVERSELY ?

21:54.933 --> 21:56.167
DO YOU THINK
YOU WOULD NOTICE IT ?

21:56.200 --> 21:57.233
DO YOU THINK IT
WOULD BOTHER YOU,

21:57.267 --> 21:58.867
LIKE, THROUGHOUT
THE DAY...

21:58.900 --> 22:00.800
"THERE'S NO PILLOWS
ON THIS COUCH."

22:00.833 --> 22:02.533
I KNOW AT NIGHT,

22:02.567 --> 22:04.367
IT WOULD HAVE
AN AFFECT AT NIGHT.

22:04.400 --> 22:05.900
WHAT ?

22:05.933 --> 22:09.400
WHAT ? A WORLD
WITHOUT PILLOWS.

22:09.433 --> 22:10.500
A "TWILIGHT ZONE"
EPISODE,

22:10.533 --> 22:11.533
ALL THE PILLOWS
ARE GONE.

22:11.567 --> 22:13.400
THERE ARE
NO PILLOWS.

22:13.433 --> 22:15.567
THERE'S CUSHIONS TO SIT ON,
BUT NO PILLOWS.

22:15.600 --> 22:17.833
CHERYL ?

22:17.867 --> 22:18.933
WENDY, HI.

22:18.967 --> 22:20.633
IT IS SUCH A
PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

22:20.667 --> 22:21.867
OH, THE PLEASURE
IS ALL MINE.

22:21.900 --> 22:23.867
I SAW YOU IN
A PRODUCTION
OF "COMPANY",

22:23.900 --> 22:25.800
IN NEW YORK
YEARS AGO.

22:25.833 --> 22:27.167
YOU WERE
SENSATIONAL.

22:27.200 --> 22:28.500
THANK YOU.

22:28.533 --> 22:31.200
TODD ?

22:31.233 --> 22:32.900
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE ?

22:36.500 --> 22:38.133
IT'S LARRY.

22:38.167 --> 22:40.467
WAIT, DO YOU GUYS
KNOW EACH OTHER ?

22:40.500 --> 22:42.467
( Wendy )
WELL, WE CAN'T
TALK ABOUT IT.

22:46.733 --> 22:49.733
OKAY, THIS IS
MY HUSBAND, LARRY.

22:49.767 --> 22:51.733
SO, HOW DO YOU
KNOW HER ?

22:51.767 --> 22:53.833
WELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT IT WAS,

22:53.867 --> 22:56.233
IT WAS THAT NEWSSTAND
ON LAS PALMAS,

22:56.267 --> 22:58.467
AND HE WAS
TEASING ME

22:58.500 --> 23:01.367
'CAUSE I WAS READING
"DOG FANCY" MAGAZINE.

23:01.400 --> 23:02.833
RIGHT ?

23:02.867 --> 23:05.067
RIGHT, YEAH,
AT THE NEWSSTAND.

23:05.100 --> 23:07.067
HE WAS SO FUNNY,
BY THE WAY.

23:07.100 --> 23:09.833
YOU ARE SO LUCKY TO HAVE
SUCH A FUNNY HUSBAND.

23:09.867 --> 23:12.167
BUT, YOU CALLED
HIM "TODD".

23:12.200 --> 23:14.200
IT'S THE NAME
HE GAVE ME.

23:14.233 --> 23:15.567
I GET SICK OF
SAYING LARRY.

23:15.600 --> 23:17.867
SO, I SAY "TODD" TO
STRANGERS SOMETIMES.

23:17.900 --> 23:20.767
ON OCCASION, I MAKE UP
STUPID NAMES FOR MYSELF.

23:20.800 --> 23:24.633
I HAVE TOLD PEOPLE
THAT MY NAME WAS "THOR"...

23:24.667 --> 23:27.900
OKAY,
ALRIGHT...

23:27.933 --> 23:29.567
LET'S JUST
WAIT A SECOND.

23:29.600 --> 23:31.300
THIS JUST
SEEMS VERY ODD.

23:31.333 --> 23:32.867
LISTEN, LISTEN,

23:32.900 --> 23:34.600
DO YOU GUYS
KNOW EACH OTHER ?

23:34.633 --> 23:36.400
YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO BE WORRIED ABOUT.

23:36.433 --> 23:38.067
IT'S JUST KIND
OF PERSONAL.

23:38.067 --> 23:39.533
OH, IT IS ?

23:41.967 --> 23:43.600
I CAN'T DEAL
WITH THIS.

23:43.633 --> 23:45.533
I AM SORRY,
I'M SORRY.

23:45.567 --> 23:47.767
THIS IS
TOO STRANGE FOR ME.

23:47.800 --> 23:50.333
OH, NO, NO, CHERYL,
DON'T DO THIS, PLEASE.

23:50.367 --> 23:51.567
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO FIND ANOTHER ACTRESS.

23:51.600 --> 23:53.633
OH, PLEASE, CHERYL,
DON'T DO THIS.

23:53.667 --> 23:55.267
I'M BEGGING YOU.

23:55.300 --> 23:56.767
IT'S NOT
WHAT YOU THINK.

23:56.800 --> 23:59.167
( Cheryl )
LARRY, I'LL TALK
TO YOU LATER.

23:59.200 --> 24:01.833
LISTEN, I WANNA MAKE
ONE THING VERY CLEAR,

24:01.867 --> 24:03.600
YOU CANNOT MENTION ONE WORD
OF WHAT YOU HEARD.

24:03.633 --> 24:06.500
DON'T WORRY,
I WOULD NEVER
BETRAY YOU.

24:06.533 --> 24:08.367
THANK YOU.

24:08.400 --> 24:10.533
YOU'RE WELCOME.

24:10.567 --> 24:11.900
( Larry )
SHE HAD SEX WITH
HER GRANDFATHER !

24:11.933 --> 24:13.533
THEN SHE HAD SEX WITH
HER UNCLES, BOTH UNCLES !

24:13.567 --> 24:15.167
ONE ON HER MOTHER'S SIDE
AND ONE ON HER FATHER'S SIDE,

24:15.200 --> 24:16.267
AND THEY DIDN'T
EVEN GET ALONG !

24:16.300 --> 24:17.500
EVEN AS THEY
WERE DOING IT,

24:17.533 --> 24:19.467
THEY WERE FIGHTING OVER
WHO WAS GONNA GUARD THE DOOR.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.067
AND THEN SHE HAD SEX
WITH HER STEPBROTHER,

24:21.067 --> 24:23.067
AND SHE WASN'T EVEN SURE
IF THAT WAS INCEST OR NOT,

24:23.067 --> 24:24.500
AND I COMPLETELY
UNDERSTOOD,

24:24.533 --> 24:25.967
AND SHE EVEN ASKED
THE GROUP LEADER.

24:26.067 --> 24:28.133
AND THE GROUP LEADER SAID
THAT A STEP IS INCEST...

24:28.167 --> 24:29.267
RIGHT.

24:29.300 --> 24:31.067
AND SHE WASN'T EVEN DONE,
SHE HAD MORE,

24:31.100 --> 24:33.767
SHE HAD TO STOP,
SHE'S GONNA FINISH NEXT WEEK.

24:33.800 --> 24:36.333
THAT'S HORRIBLE,
I HAD NO IDEA.

24:36.367 --> 24:38.867
AND THE WHOLE TIME THEY'RE
TELLING US ABOUT ANONYMITY.

24:38.900 --> 24:40.367
YOU CAN'T SAY
ANYTHING TO ANYBODY

24:40.400 --> 24:41.533
ABOUT WHAT'S BEING
SAID IN THE ROOM.

24:41.567 --> 24:43.800
SO, NO WONDER.

24:43.833 --> 24:45.267
WHAT CAN YOU SAY ?

24:45.300 --> 24:47.433
OH, MY GOD, AND
THEN I STORMED OUT,

24:47.467 --> 24:49.100
AND I TOLD HER TO
GET ANOTHER ACTRESS,

24:49.133 --> 24:50.300
AND I'VE JUST RUINED
ALL MY CHANCES.

24:50.333 --> 24:52.967
WELL, I'M SURE
THAT THEY DIDN'T
FIND ANYBODY YET.

24:53.067 --> 24:54.233
WHY DON'T YOU
CALL HER UP ?

24:54.267 --> 24:55.733
I CAN'T CALL
HER NOW.

24:55.767 --> 24:58.367
WON'T SHE KNOW THAT YOU'VE
TALKED TO ME ABOUT THIS ?

24:58.400 --> 25:00.433
'CAUSE HOW ELSE WOULD WE HAVE
RESOLVED IT SO QUICKLY ?

25:00.467 --> 25:02.933
RIGHT, RIGHT, SHE'LL KNOW
THAT I TOLD YOU.

25:02.967 --> 25:04.400
YEAH.

25:04.433 --> 25:06.267
WHAT THE HELL ARE
WE GONNA TELL HER ?

25:08.200 --> 25:11.900
WENDY, I JUST WANTED
TO TELL YOU HOW SORRY I AM

25:11.933 --> 25:13.767
ABOUT EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED TODAY,

25:13.800 --> 25:16.733
AND, I'VE BEEN
TALKING TO LARRY

25:16.767 --> 25:18.967
AND HE TOLD ME ALL ABOUT
HOW YOU MET AT

25:19.067 --> 25:20.600
THE GAMBLERS
ANONYMOUS MEETING.

25:20.633 --> 25:22.633
RIGHT.

25:22.667 --> 25:24.667
AND I'M NOT GONNA
SAY A WORD,

25:24.700 --> 25:25.867
CROSS MY HEART.

25:25.900 --> 25:28.533
I COMPLETELY
UNDERSTAND.

25:28.567 --> 25:31.333
LARRY HAS LAID
HIS CARDS OUT,

25:31.367 --> 25:32.400
ON THE TABLE.

25:32.433 --> 25:35.733
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

25:35.767 --> 25:39.200
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
HE HAD A GAMBLING PROBLEM

25:39.233 --> 25:40.767
UNTIL TODAY.

25:40.800 --> 25:44.333
SO, IMAGINE WHAT
WE'VE BEEN TALKING

25:44.367 --> 25:45.800
BACK AND FORTH ABOUT.

25:45.833 --> 25:48.233
SO, LISTEN, I JUST
WANTED TO APOLOGIZE

25:48.267 --> 25:50.200
FOR EVERYTHING, AND
I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW

25:50.233 --> 25:53.533
THAT I AM ABSOLUTELY
THRILLED,

25:53.567 --> 25:56.767
AND I'D BE HONORED
IF I COULD DO THE PLAY...

26:00.133 --> 26:04.467
YOU'VE RE-CAST
ALREADY ?

26:04.500 --> 26:07.800
LUCY MONTONE ?

26:07.833 --> 26:10.300
WELL, THAT SEEMS
SO SUDDEN.

26:10.333 --> 26:12.867
I WAS JUST THERE.

26:12.900 --> 26:15.567
HER MANAGER
CALLED YOU.

26:15.600 --> 26:17.200
JEFF GREENE ?

26:20.067 --> 26:22.467
I DID THE NEW "DARK SHADOWS"
FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS,

26:22.500 --> 26:23.867
AND THEN I DID
"ROCK COP".

26:23.900 --> 26:25.700
OH, YEAH,
YEAH, YEAH,

26:25.733 --> 26:28.067
THAT WAS GOOD,
"ROCK COP".

26:28.067 --> 26:29.933
WOW, BLUE LABEL.

26:29.967 --> 26:31.067
YEP.

26:31.100 --> 26:35.300
IT WAS A GIFT FROM
CHERYL DAVID.

26:35.333 --> 26:37.333
THAT'S IRONIC.

26:37.367 --> 26:39.300
ARE YOU GONNA BE ALRIGHT
DRIVING AFTER WE DRINK ?

26:39.333 --> 26:40.833
OH, WE'LL
WAIT IT OUT.

26:40.867 --> 26:43.533
HERE'S TO
"THE VAGINA MONOLOGUES".

26:43.567 --> 26:45.900
HEY, HERE'S

26:51.867 --> 26:53.300

26:53.333 --> 26:54.933
( Larry )
HEY, THAT

26:54.967 --> 26:56.600
YEAH, YEAH,

26:56.633 --> 26:59.767
HI, PLEASE

26:59.800 --> 27:01.067
OH, GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

27:01.100 --> 27:02.600
HI, HEY !

27:02.633 --> 27:04.467
I AM SO SORRY
I'M LATE.

27:04.500 --> 27:06.067
OH, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

27:06.067 --> 27:07.867
THERE WAS
AN ACCIDENT
ON THE 405,

27:07.900 --> 27:11.267
A ONE-CAR ACCIDENT,
TERRIBLE ACCIDENT,

27:11.300 --> 27:14.067
LOTS OF TRAFFIC,
CONFUSION AND SO ON.

27:14.100 --> 27:15.800
I'M A DOCTOR,
I HAD TO STOP.

27:15.833 --> 27:17.300
NOT THAT I COULD
DO ANYTHING.

27:17.333 --> 27:19.067
FINALLY, THEY GOT HIM
OUT OF THE CAR,

27:19.100 --> 27:20.767
BIG, BIG FAT GUY

27:20.800 --> 27:24.067
AND A WOMAN, A REAL
JAZZY NUMBER.

27:24.067 --> 27:26.700
BOTH OF THEM OBVIOUSLY
DRUNK OUT OF THEIR MINDS.

27:26.733 --> 27:28.500
HE SEEMED OKAY,

27:28.533 --> 27:32.433
BUT, SHE'S GONNA BE
LAID UP FOR A WHILE,

27:32.467 --> 27:33.533
I'M AFRAID.

27:33.567 --> 27:34.933
SHE'S REALLY
IN BAD SHAPE.

27:34.967 --> 27:37.200
AND THIS CAR,
THIS BEAUTIFUL CAR.

27:37.233 --> 27:39.200

YEAH, CONVERTIBLE.

27:46.467 --> 27:48.833
OH, I'D GIVE MY EYE TEETH

27:48.867 --> 27:50.833
RIGHT, RIGHT.

27:50.867 --> 27:52.233

BE STARVED.

27:52.267 --> 27:53.467
YEAH, WELL,

OH, THANK YOU.

28:24.533 --> 28:25.567
LOOK AT THAT POMPADOUR
YOU GOT THERE.

28:25.600 --> 28:26.867
IT'S NOT
A POMPADOUR.

28:26.900 --> 28:28.533
NO, SOMEBODY SPENT
A LOT OF TIME

28:28.567 --> 28:30.733
GETTING MY HAIR TO

28:30.767 --> 28:34.300
OH, GOSH, I'M TRYING TO
SHAKE OUT THE NERVES...

28:34.333 --> 28:35.767
OH, DON'T
BE NERVOUS.

28:35.800 --> 28:37.133
YOU ONLY HAVE
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

28:37.167 --> 28:38.700
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SHOW IT.

28:38.733 --> 28:40.133
OKAY,
THANK YOU.
