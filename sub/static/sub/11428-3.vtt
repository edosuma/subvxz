AGNES HAILSTONE:
Go, go, go.

00:14.267 --> 00:16.633
-Another day of snow
in this winter wonderland.
-Whee!

00:17.233 --> 00:18.633
AGNES: Today we're going
up the river.

00:21.333 --> 00:24.533
There's caribou crossing
by the hundreds up the river.

00:25.233 --> 00:27.700
This is the time to go
do our caribou hunt.

00:27.833 --> 00:29.433
The river's about to freeze.

00:31.267 --> 00:33.367
This is the time we go out
and go get our meat.

00:33.633 --> 00:36.967
We could have meat
during the freeze-up.

00:37.300 --> 00:40.000
Jon's gonna be here with us.
He just came in from Selawik.

00:40.233 --> 00:43.267
JON: I haven't been up here
hunting with my parents
in quite a few years.

00:43.333 --> 00:47.800
I'm ready to go do
just about anything to catch
a boatload of caribou.

00:47.867 --> 00:49.600
I need meat.

00:49.667 --> 00:51.333
CHIP HAILSTONE:
Around this time of year I
usually have like 30 caribou,

00:51.400 --> 00:52.567
and a lot of food security.

00:52.633 --> 00:54.733
But, erm, that just ain't
the way it is right now.

00:55.200 --> 00:56.800
The thing about freeze-up
is that you never know

00:56.867 --> 00:58.633
when it's gonna occur or
how many times it'll occur.

00:59.067 --> 01:00.500
Sometimes it comes
along and it thaws.

01:00.567 --> 01:02.167
Sometimes it comes along
and just stays frozen.

01:02.233 --> 01:04.200
But we're gonna try and get
as many caribou as we can.

01:04.567 --> 01:07.633
We're not trophy
hunting, we're hunting for
food, so it's all about food.

01:08.133 --> 01:09.667
That's the real trophy.

01:11.300 --> 01:13.300
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

01:35.033 --> 01:37.200
It's a long trip up there
to go set up camp,

01:37.400 --> 01:39.833
and our chances of seeing
animals between here
and there are great.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.700
And if they are, we'll
just stop and work 'em.

01:41.767 --> 01:45.300
And wherever we find ourselves
this evening, we'll sit
and make camp, all right?

01:47.033 --> 01:49.933
NARRATOR:
With limited time before
the caribou migration ends,

01:50.467 --> 01:53.933
the Hailstones must intercept
the herd before
the river freezes.

01:57.667 --> 02:01.167
Heck, if we really score good,
maybe we'll just sleep at home
in bed.

02:01.467 --> 02:02.600
(LAUGHING)

02:08.967 --> 02:11.900
CHIP: Well, the biggest
problem you have right now
is having it be so cold

02:11.967 --> 02:13.367
and then getting wet.

02:13.867 --> 02:16.567
Getting wet is the
real bullshit pain.

02:22.333 --> 02:23.533
(TINMIAQ SPEAKING)

02:24.100 --> 02:26.533
So it's about to freeze
up in a couple days,

02:26.600 --> 02:28.933
and we usually come up here
to go get all the bulls

02:29.567 --> 02:31.033
while they cross the river,

02:32.500 --> 02:34.833
and set up a camp,
spend the night.

02:36.700 --> 02:38.300
CHIP:
I don't see any fresh tracks.

02:39.700 --> 02:40.933
But who knows?

02:41.500 --> 02:43.233
Maybe we'll get lucky,
maybe we won't.

02:45.200 --> 02:47.067
This is probably the first
time I've ever been up here

02:47.133 --> 02:49.200
and not seen anything,
caribou-wise.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.533
But what we need to do
is get a few before rut hits.

02:53.500 --> 02:56.333
For now we're just happy to be
right here in the
place we are.

02:56.433 --> 02:58.133
Hopefully there will be
caribou crossing tomorrow.

02:58.200 --> 03:00.567
We're just gonna keep at it
until we get what we need.

03:05.633 --> 03:08.633
SUE AIKINS: Throw a pebble
into the ocean, you're still
gonna have a ripple.

03:08.700 --> 03:11.733
Sooner or later it's
a tidal wave
in another part of the world.

03:16.433 --> 03:21.067
Well, today's the day I say
goodbye to
my last little clients.

03:21.300 --> 03:25.233
NARRATOR: Kavik River Camp
serves as a remote fuelling
station and bed-and-breakfast

03:25.300 --> 03:27.633
for bush pilots who are
passing through the tundra.

03:28.167 --> 03:30.433
With her season of
clients coming to an end,

03:30.800 --> 03:33.533
Sue must now prepare
for dark winter alone.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.967
Well, there's always
a little trepidation.

03:37.200 --> 03:40.900

around and I'm like, "Ah..."

03:40.967 --> 03:44.067

is overwhelming, and...
(EXCLAIMS)

03:44.133 --> 03:46.300
I'm not gonna see
anybody for a while.

03:46.467 --> 03:49.467
It's an emotional trip.
People are leaving
and you're all by yourself.

03:49.767 --> 03:51.633
-And on one hand that feels...
-(AEROPLANE ENGINE ROARING)

03:52.167 --> 03:54.900
It is vast and
overwhelming country,

03:55.067 --> 03:57.100
so it feels vast
and overwhelming.

03:57.167 --> 03:59.800
It's the life that I choose,
it's the life that I love.

04:00.367 --> 04:02.933
And then suddenly it doesn't
seem so overwhelming.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.167
Got to get to work.

04:08.333 --> 04:11.167
Time to get myself a little
cup of tea and warm up.

04:12.633 --> 04:14.867
Winter's not waiting
on me to be ready.

04:14.933 --> 04:16.000
It's here.

04:16.300 --> 04:19.267
What I need to do is get
all my jet fuel barrels.

04:19.333 --> 04:21.767
Get 'em over to the
fuel shed to get filled.

04:21.933 --> 04:23.967
Get as many pallets as I can,

04:24.367 --> 04:26.700
erm, and get those over
by my heat tank.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.367
I need to get it to where it
needs to live for the winter

04:29.433 --> 04:32.533
to make it the, er, easiest,
closest for me

04:32.600 --> 04:35.433
when the conditions are
brutally cold
and brutally dark.

04:38.200 --> 04:40.567
Just gonna take a quick
look at my barrels.

04:43.333 --> 04:45.033
(SIGHS) What a project.

04:45.100 --> 04:47.100
Four barrels go on a pallet.

04:47.900 --> 04:53.233
In order for me
to have enough fuel
for the entire winter,

04:53.300 --> 04:54.967
that's 48 barrels.

04:55.767 --> 04:57.467
I have to individually,

04:58.967 --> 05:00.500
look at each barrel...

05:02.767 --> 05:04.133
Say yes or no to it.

05:04.433 --> 05:06.933
See if they're empty.
If they're not,
verify what's in it.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.300
Check it out. Make sure
there's no holes.

05:09.367 --> 05:12.667
Even a pinhole leak,
it's a protected ecosystem.

05:12.733 --> 05:16.000
You can't leak fuel out
all over, it's just not
the way it's done.

05:16.233 --> 05:19.633
So I have to visually inspect
each year, each barrel.

05:19.700 --> 05:21.667
This is a no.

05:23.700 --> 05:24.933
Bad ones are over here.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.033
Why are they bad? Well, this
one has a hole in it.

05:27.100 --> 05:29.367
This one's beat up
really dang bad.

05:29.433 --> 05:31.300
Looks like it's been
that way for a while.

05:31.667 --> 05:34.800
Right here is a ding,
but it's not a hole.

05:34.867 --> 05:37.467
But if I need 48 barrels,

05:38.367 --> 05:40.467
I've got to do 48 inspections.

05:42.567 --> 05:43.800
You know, I'm getting colder.

05:43.867 --> 05:45.667
Am I well below zero?

05:45.733 --> 05:49.200
No, but now is the time to get
everything where
it needs to be.

05:49.267 --> 05:53.500
I have to continue my process
on getting the barrels
where they need to live,

05:53.567 --> 05:56.400
because overnight
I can drop below zero.

05:56.600 --> 05:58.800
Within a couple weeks
I'm gonna be dark.

06:00.867 --> 06:03.467
I got 48 that are
free of holes,

06:03.533 --> 06:06.500
free of things that'll
compromise the integrity
of the barrel.

06:06.567 --> 06:09.333
Next step for me though,
for this, get to work.

06:09.400 --> 06:10.633
Start pumping fuel.

06:14.633 --> 06:17.433
JESSIE HOLMES:
I've got a passion for this
and that's what drives me,

06:17.600 --> 06:20.333
it's passion, determination,
competitiveness.

06:26.967 --> 06:29.067
Winter is coming fast,
it's already snowed.

06:29.133 --> 06:31.033
The ground's been
freezing every morning,

06:31.100 --> 06:35.067
but now it's time to turn my
full attention to my last
big priority of the season,

06:35.133 --> 06:37.767
before winter, is to put up a
lot of fish here for the dogs.

06:37.833 --> 06:41.433
NARRATOR: Jessie Holmes
relies on the resources
along the Nenana River

06:41.500 --> 06:44.767
to maintain a subsistence
lifestyle with his team
of sled dogs.

06:45.233 --> 06:47.067
To survive the
long winter ahead,

06:47.133 --> 06:50.867
it is vital for Jessie
to catch fish
before the river freezes.

06:53.200 --> 06:56.900
JESSIE: My lead, which is one
of the most important parts
of the fish wheel,

06:56.967 --> 06:58.867
is in pretty bad condition.

06:58.933 --> 07:03.233
A lead is basically a fence
from the shore to the baskets
of the fish wheel.

07:03.300 --> 07:05.067
So the fish hit it,

07:05.133 --> 07:08.033
they have no way to go through
except into the baskets
scooping them up.

07:08.267 --> 07:10.567
The trick about a fish wheel
is attention to detail,

07:10.633 --> 07:13.233
and this lead is one of the
most important parts of it.

07:13.300 --> 07:15.533
It could run now without the
lead, it'd catch some fish,

07:15.600 --> 07:18.533
but I'm not looking for
some fish, I'm looking for
hundreds of fish.

07:21.233 --> 07:23.967
Next thing is just to
physically push this in here.

07:25.300 --> 07:27.933
If you fall in this river,
you know, you're not gonna
make it very long,

07:28.000 --> 07:29.267
especially this time of year.

07:29.967 --> 07:32.033
You could get hit by any
moving part

07:32.100 --> 07:34.067
or scooped up into the basket
if you fall in,

07:34.433 --> 07:36.633
and you could lose your
boat and your life.

07:44.267 --> 07:46.167
Oh, come on.
You got to be kidding.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.400
All right!
Done.

07:58.233 --> 08:00.067
I'm hoping that
this will be productive

08:00.333 --> 08:03.567
'cause I wanna put up as much
fish as I possibly can
before winter.

08:09.667 --> 08:11.267
Nothing goes to waste.

08:11.333 --> 08:13.733
What I don't use,
there's other animals
that will use it.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.333
It's getting light out there.

08:27.433 --> 08:28.800
I got to get back
up to that moose.

08:28.867 --> 08:31.167
I got to go up there and get
that before anything finds it.

08:31.767 --> 08:33.533
This time of year
there's still bears around.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.267
There are wolves around,
there're wolverines.

08:35.333 --> 08:39.200
If anything gets to that moose
before I get there,
they'll eat it up.

08:39.667 --> 08:41.300
What they don't eat,
they'll destroy.

08:41.367 --> 08:42.767
I got to get up there
as fast as I can.

08:43.667 --> 08:46.533
NARRATOR: Glenn Villeneuve
has successfully harvested
a moose,

08:46.600 --> 08:51.033
which he relies on to provide
enough meat and protein to
survive most of the year.

08:51.400 --> 08:54.367
He must retrieve the meat
before scavengers devour it,

08:54.933 --> 08:57.000
or be forced to search for
other food sources in

08:57.067 --> 08:59.400
dark winter when the
animals are scarce.

09:00.600 --> 09:04.467
Bears don't go into
hibernation till two or three
weeks from now, so,

09:04.533 --> 09:06.167
I definitely want my rifle.

09:06.567 --> 09:07.867
Very important.

09:08.367 --> 09:10.267
As I approach that moose...
(RIFLE CLICKING)

09:11.933 --> 09:16.600
Main thing on my mind,
did anything get there
before I get back to it?

09:19.467 --> 09:22.167
I got about four and a half
miles of walking in the snow.

09:22.233 --> 09:24.300
I'm gonna be dragging
heavy loads of meat.

09:25.333 --> 09:27.200
I got to get that
moose back to camp.

09:32.567 --> 09:34.267
I'm listening carefully.

09:35.067 --> 09:37.033
Listening for any sounds.

09:37.567 --> 09:39.367
Trying to look ahead,

09:39.667 --> 09:41.800
see as far as I can
in the forest.

09:41.867 --> 09:45.400
Looking at the snow, are there
any bear tracks around?

09:46.667 --> 09:47.767
Just paying close attention.

09:47.833 --> 09:49.667
I don't want to
get surprised here.

09:51.233 --> 09:53.400
The moose is just over
the other side
of this little hill.

09:53.467 --> 09:55.100
I can't see it.

09:55.167 --> 09:56.233
(TAKES DEEP BREATH)

09:56.300 --> 09:58.467
But it's just on the
other side of this hill.

09:58.667 --> 10:02.133
I've gotta be very careful,
going up over this last hill.

10:02.200 --> 10:04.500
Make sure there's
nothing there, I don't want
to get a surprise.

10:05.033 --> 10:09.233
It's very dangerous situation.
If you come across a bear
that's on a food pile,

10:09.667 --> 10:11.600
they can be
extremely aggressive.

10:18.500 --> 10:19.567
There it is.

10:22.200 --> 10:24.700
Looks good,
just how I left it.

10:28.967 --> 10:30.667
I want to keep the meat
as clean as possible.

10:30.733 --> 10:33.500
So I got this tarp, I'm gonna
set each piece down here,

10:33.567 --> 10:35.700
wrap it up, and drag it home.

10:36.133 --> 10:37.200
Okay.

10:37.967 --> 10:39.233
(GRUNTS)

10:39.300 --> 10:41.067
I want to start with some
of the tastiest meat.

10:41.133 --> 10:44.233
The pelvis here's got the
tenderloins and the backstrap.

10:44.833 --> 10:46.733
(SIGHS) There, that's a
heavy piece of meat.

10:48.167 --> 10:49.767
I'm gonna make a new trail.

10:50.033 --> 10:52.233
Try to go as straight
as I can right down.

10:53.367 --> 10:56.867
Try to find the path of least
resistance through all
these woods here.

10:57.333 --> 10:59.400
That's where I got to get it
to, down there to the water.

10:59.467 --> 11:01.767
That's where the camp is,
500 yards down.

11:09.733 --> 11:10.933
-(THUD)
-(PAINFULLY) Aah!

11:11.433 --> 11:13.067
Whoa!

11:13.133 --> 11:14.600
This is out of control.

11:14.667 --> 11:16.767
Living out here by myself
I got to be really careful.

11:16.833 --> 11:19.267
I don't want to take extra
chances I don't have to take.

11:19.333 --> 11:21.833
Running down that hill in
front of this sled
is not a good idea.

11:21.900 --> 11:24.533
I could get myself run over,
if this thing hit me
in the legs,

11:25.033 --> 11:26.633
I mean, it would knock
me right over.
I could get hurt.

11:26.700 --> 11:28.100
I got to put the
brakes on this thing.

11:29.100 --> 11:31.967
If I put rope underneath it,
the weight of all that meat,

11:32.033 --> 11:35.400
pushing down hard
on that sled, it'll force
that rope into the snow,

11:35.467 --> 11:36.667
it'll create
a lot more drag.

11:37.533 --> 11:38.600
That's the theory anyway.

11:38.667 --> 11:40.100
I got to see how it works.

11:41.733 --> 11:43.667
I got the brake on.
I'm gonna try it out.

11:43.733 --> 11:47.500
Hopefully this time, this
thing's under control and I
don't get myself run over.

11:50.133 --> 11:52.667
Oh yeah. There's a
lot more resistance.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.033
Lot of drag there,
that's helping.

12:01.533 --> 12:03.500
Oh, perfect.
No problems.

12:06.367 --> 12:07.867
No problems. Problem solved.

12:09.033 --> 12:10.200
(GRUNTS)

12:10.267 --> 12:12.533
There. One down, seven to go.

12:14.700 --> 12:16.067
You got to really be on it.

12:16.133 --> 12:18.200
Lot of work to get
done in a short time.

12:18.467 --> 12:22.933
But in a short time, I can
get enough meat
to last me for six months.

12:25.633 --> 12:28.000
What an experience.
There's nothing like it.

12:28.100 --> 12:30.567
Killing a big bull moose
up there in the woods,

12:30.633 --> 12:33.000
it was so satisfying
to have that moose,

12:33.067 --> 12:35.333
knowing that I was gonna
have moose meat this winter.

12:35.400 --> 12:38.033
It was the most intense
moose hunt I have ever had.

12:40.567 --> 12:42.433
Headed back for the last load.

12:42.867 --> 12:45.900
Most of the meat, easiest way
to transport, it's in a sled.

12:46.133 --> 12:48.533
But for the head,
I'd rather put it on my back.

12:56.033 --> 12:57.367
(SIGHS) Ah!

12:58.767 --> 12:59.967
Made it back.

13:00.233 --> 13:02.333
Hey, look at that,
all the meat's still there.

13:02.400 --> 13:03.800
Nothing came into camp
while I was gone.

13:03.867 --> 13:05.333
That's good.

13:05.400 --> 13:07.900
Now the moose is
all in one place,
I can keep an eye on it.

13:07.967 --> 13:10.633
I can see it right out
my window, much more secure.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.567
And then tomorrow
I'm gonna get up,

13:12.633 --> 13:14.233
and I've got to
reposition this moose.

13:14.300 --> 13:16.767
I've got to secure it
so that I can leave camp

13:16.833 --> 13:19.200
and know that nothing's gonna
happen to it when I'm gone.

13:24.767 --> 13:26.767
JESSIE: Nothing ever goes to
waste around here.

13:26.833 --> 13:27.967
That's what dogs are for.

13:34.500 --> 13:36.367
Setting down here
to check the fish wheel.

13:36.700 --> 13:38.200
It's been running all night.

13:38.500 --> 13:41.533
I'm really hoping the labour
and the new lead's
gonna pay off.

13:42.067 --> 13:44.033
The season's coming
close to an end.

13:44.367 --> 13:46.533
I need a lot of fish
going into the winter.

13:46.600 --> 13:48.033
The winter's long up here.

13:48.467 --> 13:51.633
You get all the conditions
up here, 50 below zero, wind.

13:51.700 --> 13:55.167
And that all affects dogs
and ups the amount
of calories they need.

13:55.300 --> 13:56.600
Dogs love fish soup.

13:56.900 --> 13:58.367
Nothing gets them
going in the morning

13:58.433 --> 14:00.800
like fish soup boiled up
with a little fat, so...

14:01.300 --> 14:02.833
Oh, it's looking
like it's running.

14:02.900 --> 14:06.133
You know the lead's
all in place,
that's an important thing,

14:06.200 --> 14:08.733
it ain't gonna catch no
fish if it ain't in place.

14:09.267 --> 14:10.933
Oh, I see a lot of
fish right there.

14:11.667 --> 14:12.967
It's looking great.

14:13.833 --> 14:16.200
Wow, it's looking
better than I expected. Whoa.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.533
There's a fish right there.

14:18.800 --> 14:19.867
Wow.

14:20.100 --> 14:21.433
This is a lot of fish.

14:21.600 --> 14:23.633
And that could feed my
dogs for a long time.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.100
I know one thing, I'm gonna
have some happy dogs.

14:33.433 --> 14:36.300
I'll use about 18 a day,
20 sometimes.

14:36.567 --> 14:39.667
So, that's, you know,
days of feed for my dogs.

14:41.067 --> 14:42.800
This is what it's
all about for me.

14:43.200 --> 14:46.100
You suffer a lot of hard times
and lean times out here,

14:46.167 --> 14:48.167
so, when it's good,
man, you're excited.

14:48.233 --> 14:52.267
You just... You realise how
lucky you are to be doing
something like this.

14:54.167 --> 14:58.267
I'm gonna throw this last
one on here, it's 177.

14:58.967 --> 15:03.467
So, now I got haul all these
up to my house on the
Nenana River and get to work,

15:03.533 --> 15:06.333
you know, moving 'em and
getting 'em to where they're
gonna be for the winter.

15:07.400 --> 15:09.000
Fishing is nothing but work.

15:09.300 --> 15:12.700
But whenever it pays off
it's the best feeling
you could have.

15:15.733 --> 15:20.267
SUE: Winter is not waiting
for me to get rested and
have time to feel cosy.

15:20.533 --> 15:21.633
It's here.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.833
All righty.

15:28.900 --> 15:31.100
(SIGHS) Well, there's
48 barrels of fun.

15:31.433 --> 15:33.567
(SIGHS) Count them
just to make sure.

15:36.333 --> 15:37.467
Yep, 48.

15:38.900 --> 15:40.767
This is only part
of staying warm.

15:40.900 --> 15:43.933
You don't stay warm staring
at 48 empty barrels.

15:44.900 --> 15:47.400
It's got to be
48 full barrels, so...

15:48.267 --> 15:50.667
And a job half-done
isn't done.

15:53.167 --> 15:54.733
NARRATOR: To survive the
harsh winter ahead,

15:54.800 --> 15:57.300
Sue must disperse her
fuel throughout camp.

15:57.767 --> 16:00.067
But isolated in the tundra
and working alone,

16:00.133 --> 16:03.733
filling and moving
48 barrels of fuel
is a hefty undertaking.

16:04.267 --> 16:06.500
SUE: This is a 200-gallon
portable tank.

16:06.567 --> 16:08.267
I carry it wherever I need it.

16:11.300 --> 16:12.900
This is my fuel shed.

16:13.633 --> 16:16.767
I just got fuel
in the big bladder
over here the other day.

16:16.833 --> 16:19.833
Now I need to start taking it
out and sprinkling it
around camp.

16:22.533 --> 16:24.167
(ENGINE ROARING)

16:24.233 --> 16:25.633
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.067
It's kicked on.

16:28.133 --> 16:29.900
I'm trying to be very careful.

16:29.967 --> 16:33.433
I'm giving myself 10 gallons
of fuel a day for
whatever purpose I need it.

16:33.800 --> 16:38.300
That's 3,000 gallons in an
average winter between
loads of fuel.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.467
That cold winter
weather's coming in.

16:43.533 --> 16:46.300
It's better if I can get
a lot of my work done,

16:46.367 --> 16:48.900
my winter fuel where it
needs to live now,

16:48.967 --> 16:52.967
than waiting till it's 50, 60
below and then saying,
"Shit, where's my fuel?"

16:57.300 --> 17:02.167
Take this into the gen shed,
plop it into the tank,
come back for more.

17:06.200 --> 17:07.600
Fuck.

17:07.667 --> 17:08.767
Fuck.

17:09.967 --> 17:11.000
Really?

17:13.433 --> 17:16.867
I've definitely got smoke
coming over here,

17:17.433 --> 17:20.767
kind of by, where this filter
is, something smells hot.

17:20.833 --> 17:22.433
It could just be overheating,

17:23.333 --> 17:28.700
I thought I had a radiator
issue before,
coolant issue before.

17:29.700 --> 17:31.167
Sorta smells that way.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.500
It is a catastrophe if
this Bobcat goes down.

17:36.533 --> 17:39.533
I don't have the money for a
new one. I don't have it.

17:40.733 --> 17:42.800
Winter is beating
down the door.

17:42.867 --> 17:47.800
If I want to be successful at
being warm this winter, then
I've got to fix the Bobcat,

17:47.933 --> 17:51.667
or at least fix it enough that
I can get the hard work done.

17:51.733 --> 17:54.600
The problem is it's a very,
very old piece of equipment.

17:55.200 --> 17:58.733
You know, you're, you're
talking 20, 30-year-old
piece of equipment.

17:58.833 --> 18:02.467
Been around the block a few
time like the town bike,
everybody's had a ride.

18:02.633 --> 18:06.400
So I'll start it off simple,
process of elimination.

18:06.467 --> 18:10.600
See if I can see
an obvious thing, but do the
simple things, check the oil.

18:11.267 --> 18:14.233
If it's out of oil it's gonna
be hot and it's gonna
be unhappy.

18:15.233 --> 18:18.267
And you are
pretty low on oil.

18:19.900 --> 18:22.600
A Bobcat 753

18:23.033 --> 18:27.100
will take seven and a half
quarts of oil
on a full oil change.

18:27.433 --> 18:32.000
I'm not doing a full oil
change right now, I'm just
bringing it up to level,

18:32.533 --> 18:34.967
and gonna see if that
makes any difference.

18:35.467 --> 18:37.833
It's starting to get a little
bit on the late side tonight,

18:37.900 --> 18:40.533
but I just want to see,
is there something obvious?

18:40.967 --> 18:42.433
Was it just a little low?

18:53.100 --> 18:55.200
(SUE SPEAKING)

18:55.533 --> 18:58.600
There's a petcock valve,
and it's leaking anti-freeze.

18:59.467 --> 19:03.667
It's already smelling warm
to me, and it hasn't
gone anywhere.

19:03.733 --> 19:06.867
I'm gonna take it back,
park it just like it was.

19:07.200 --> 19:09.600
Get my little book out,
read up, what the hell is it?

19:09.667 --> 19:10.800
What does it mean?

19:11.000 --> 19:12.533
Leaking anti-freeze
is not good.

19:12.600 --> 19:15.900
It's not good for the animals,
and it's not good
for my vehicle.

19:18.800 --> 19:21.467
My whole plan with
working smart instead of hard

19:21.700 --> 19:26.167
falls to pieces when the
equipment meant to do the
hard part for me fails.

19:26.233 --> 19:28.867
Now worst-case scenario,
the Bobcat doesn't get fixed,

19:28.933 --> 19:31.667
I don't have the money laying
around to get another one.

19:31.733 --> 19:34.600
Everything'll have to be
filled, five-gallon cans
at a time.

19:35.033 --> 19:37.967
But the stakes are pretty
freaking high for me
to get this job done.

19:41.700 --> 19:43.467
GLENN VILLENEUVE:
Not everybody has the chance

19:43.533 --> 19:44.700
to go out and hunt
for their own food.

19:44.767 --> 19:47.167
If you really want to,
it's still possible.

19:50.167 --> 19:51.400
(SIGHS)

19:52.067 --> 19:55.300
I'm going from the whole
animal down to
bite-sized pieces.

19:56.867 --> 19:58.167
(SIGHS)

19:58.233 --> 20:00.067
NARRATOR: With all of his
moose meat back in camp,

20:00.133 --> 20:02.167
Glenn must now carry
the supply to an area

20:02.233 --> 20:04.433
that is safely out of
reach from scavengers.

20:04.500 --> 20:08.600
I still got to get this
secure, so that when I leave
camp, nothing can get to it.

20:08.667 --> 20:10.300
When I'm not here to watch it,

20:10.500 --> 20:13.067
this meat has to be out
of reach of scavengers.

20:13.567 --> 20:17.467
By hanging the meat up off of
this meat pole, it protects it
from scavengers.

20:17.533 --> 20:19.300
Bears can't get
to it up there.

20:19.867 --> 20:21.033
Problem is,

20:21.300 --> 20:24.700
I built this meat pole
11 years ago.

20:24.867 --> 20:28.367
It's getting old, it's not
in good shape inside.

20:28.567 --> 20:30.233
Eventually it's
gonna fall over.

20:30.300 --> 20:32.400
I just don't want it to come
down with me on top of it.

20:32.467 --> 20:34.100
-It's 20-feet high...
-(WOOD CREAKING)

20:34.167 --> 20:36.333
If that thing broke
when I was up there,
that would be a disaster.

20:36.400 --> 20:39.800
I can't chance it.
I can't put a whole moose
on this any more.

20:40.467 --> 20:42.233
I think I'm gonna have to
divide up the weight.

20:42.933 --> 20:46.833
I'll put part of it
on this pole, I'll put part
of it up on this platform,

20:47.333 --> 20:48.900
less stress on
these structures.

20:50.700 --> 20:51.933
-(CHAINS CLANGING)
-All right.

20:52.333 --> 20:53.467
See how this goes.

20:54.267 --> 20:58.400
I'm just worried about the,
the poles themselves,
how strong they are.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.567
Just gonna take it slow.

21:03.233 --> 21:04.400
Keep my balance.

21:06.867 --> 21:08.200
(GRUNTING)

21:13.800 --> 21:15.700
(EXHALES DEEPLY)
Got it up here.

21:20.567 --> 21:22.633
That's definitely as much
weight as I want
on that platform.

21:22.700 --> 21:25.367
I want to put the rest of it
up here on this meat pole.

21:27.333 --> 21:30.233
Getting this little block
and tackle together,
this is gonna help me.

21:30.300 --> 21:32.733
I can lift a very
heavy weight with this.

21:32.800 --> 21:35.433
I've got to go all the way
up on top of the pole

21:35.933 --> 21:37.733
in order to make
this system work.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.933
(WOOD CREAKING)

21:42.500 --> 21:46.333
I can't see what's going on
inside that wood so I just
have to use my best judgment.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.500
Got to be careful up here.

21:51.567 --> 21:55.933
I'm 20 feet high, where
my feet are standing.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.300
I definitely don't
want to mess up.

22:10.900 --> 22:13.667
I had to get this
pulley up high enough

22:13.733 --> 22:16.267
so that I could wench the meat
all the way up to where
I want to hang it.

22:16.333 --> 22:17.367
Oh, wow.

22:18.933 --> 22:20.467
Really light now.

22:20.533 --> 22:22.667
It's given me a huge
mechanical advantage.

22:24.333 --> 22:27.100
There, I got it high enough.

22:27.533 --> 22:30.567
Last piece of meat, just got
to get these ribs up there.

22:30.967 --> 22:32.833
I got most of the meat over
on the platform this year...

22:32.900 --> 22:34.500
(PULLEY CREAKING)

22:34.567 --> 22:36.833
But I distributed the weight
and put some of it
on my meat pole.

22:37.367 --> 22:39.967
Got it.
That way, it's safe.

22:40.400 --> 22:42.833
Neither of those are gonna
fall down with that amount
of weight on it.

22:43.400 --> 22:45.233
And also, nothing
can get to it.

22:45.300 --> 22:46.967
Scavengers just
can't get up there.

22:47.033 --> 22:50.933
I got that moose,
I got it back to camp,
and now I got it safe.

JESSIE: The more you grow
out here, the more you
understand what it takes.

23:07.533 --> 23:11.733
I'll be building a new rack
system that I can hopefully
hang 1,000 fish on.

23:11.800 --> 23:14.733
So I can just take those fish
right off of it,
they're ready.

23:15.200 --> 23:17.967
And just to lessen my
workload, make more space.

23:18.233 --> 23:20.167
NARRATOR: Creating a fish rack
will allow Jessie

23:20.233 --> 23:23.500
to dry, smoke, and preserve
large quantities of fish.

23:23.567 --> 23:25.900
The meat will provide him
and his sled dogs

23:25.967 --> 23:28.400
with enough protein
for the long winter.

23:29.033 --> 23:30.800
I need to start
collecting some poles,

23:30.867 --> 23:33.833
and I'm gonna put 'em up with
some barrels in a level area

23:34.600 --> 23:37.000
and start filling it up
with some fish.

23:39.433 --> 23:41.200
I'm not an idealist out here.

23:41.300 --> 23:42.467
I'm a realist.

23:42.867 --> 23:45.733
If it means using a
chainsaw over a bow saw,

23:46.133 --> 23:47.733
that's the way
I'm gonna do it.

23:48.533 --> 23:52.567
Waste time doing things the
hard way, then you miss out
on a lot of opportunities.

23:55.333 --> 23:56.633
Time's of the essence.

23:57.400 --> 24:00.100
It's imperative that I get
these fish put up
for the winter,

24:00.167 --> 24:01.767
it really enables
my lifestyle.

24:01.833 --> 24:04.467
This is a huge part of my
lifestyle to have these fish.

24:05.033 --> 24:07.633
It fuels my dogs
and it fuels me.

24:09.967 --> 24:12.267
This is pretty much
what it's gonna look like.

24:12.600 --> 24:15.967
I'll be rolling these
and spacing these,

24:16.833 --> 24:20.333
even enough apart
that I can fit about
five fish per alder pole.

24:20.467 --> 24:22.667
I'm looking to not go
too far of a span

24:22.733 --> 24:26.700
'cause I don't want it to bend
and break and be under
the strain of too many fish,

24:26.767 --> 24:29.233
so, I'm just trying to fit
in this rectangle what I can.

24:29.300 --> 24:34.333
I'll have 125 fish per row,
and nine rows, so I'll have

24:34.967 --> 24:37.867
over 1,000 fish
hanging on this
which is gonna be cool.

24:41.567 --> 24:45.900
It's time to hang some fish
and try to fit as many
in there as I possibly can.

24:46.300 --> 24:49.600
As much as my rack can hold is
the work I got cut out for me.

24:51.333 --> 24:54.733
I'm just going for it,
'cause time's everything to me
right now.

24:54.800 --> 24:56.467
All these fish that
I put up now,

24:56.533 --> 24:59.833
fish that I'm putting up for
my whole winter season
of dog food.

25:00.500 --> 25:05.533
I got to cut costs of my dog
food and add a quality
supplement of fish and,

25:05.600 --> 25:07.800
you know without these fish,
life is pretty hard.

25:07.867 --> 25:11.067
I got to get this done right
so I optimize on
my catch of fish.

25:11.133 --> 25:12.967
I don't get to try
to do this again.

25:13.033 --> 25:16.700
You know, this is it, this is
my opportunity to put up fish
for the winter.

25:19.433 --> 25:21.433
Got a lot of dogs,
need a lot of fish.

25:21.700 --> 25:22.900
Got to do it right.

25:23.433 --> 25:25.967
Fifty dogs, there's no such
thing as too much fish.

25:38.033 --> 25:39.367
(CREAKING)

25:41.267 --> 25:42.833
(THUD)

25:42.900 --> 25:44.833
Fucking damn it!

25:51.900 --> 25:53.000
Fuck!

25:59.000 --> 26:02.433
Well, it's a hard lesson
that's gonna cost me
a lot of work,

26:02.500 --> 26:05.267
but it will probably stick in
my mind, you know? It's...

26:05.500 --> 26:08.433
I don't think that
plastic barrel helped me
too much there.

26:08.500 --> 26:12.300
Could have had more barrels
maybe and more supports,
and some weight.

26:12.367 --> 26:16.367
Think I cut a shortcut because
the metal barrels,
heavier to carry. (LAUGHS)

26:17.733 --> 26:19.500
And this is what
fucking happens.

26:20.667 --> 26:23.633
I'm gonna load all
these fish on the tarp.

26:23.700 --> 26:26.667
Still just really thankful
to have this fish.

26:26.733 --> 26:28.567
This is a very
valuable resource.

26:30.567 --> 26:32.800
This is costing me
valuable time

26:33.800 --> 26:36.333
that I need to be out there on
the river putting up
more fish.

26:37.033 --> 26:41.400
Takes a lot of pounds of meat
to feed these dogs, so,

26:42.133 --> 26:45.400
while this is a lot of fish
and it makes me feel good
to have it,

26:46.067 --> 26:49.433
I don't want to waste time,
thinking I got it made

26:49.500 --> 26:51.500
'cause you don't
ever have it made.

26:51.567 --> 26:53.200
You can't be complacent.

26:53.267 --> 26:56.400
I'm gonna put this back
together, I'll just put it
back together stronger.

26:59.133 --> 27:01.300
And count it a lesson learned.

27:05.933 --> 27:09.067
I got these fish, they're
ready to go back
on these racks.

27:09.133 --> 27:12.633
Racks just need to be thrown
back together a little bit
more securely.

27:13.267 --> 27:14.867
Fish got to be moved again.

27:14.933 --> 27:17.967
This task is mostly done,
so it's definitely gonna
get done.

27:18.033 --> 27:19.400
I have no choice
but to get it done,

27:19.467 --> 27:21.733
I don't start something
and not finish it.

27:29.300 --> 27:32.833
SUE: You count your years by
the winters you're surviving.

27:36.633 --> 27:37.700
All righty.

27:38.667 --> 27:41.400
Time to, er, get some
fuelling done, man.

27:41.467 --> 27:43.033
NARRATOR:
With temperatures dropping,

27:43.100 --> 27:46.133
Sue must fix her Bobcat to
disperse her fuel
throughout camp,

27:46.200 --> 27:48.767
or risk having no heat
in freezing conditions.

27:49.200 --> 27:52.700
-I'm gonna get some
anti-freeze, pour it in there.
-(ENGINE ROARING)

27:53.233 --> 27:55.133
Got to mix it 50-50.

27:56.933 --> 28:00.600
Last night coolant was leaking
out, maybe that'll fix it.

28:00.667 --> 28:04.167
If it fixes it, great,
I'll run, run, run,
get my fuelling done.

28:06.200 --> 28:09.733
I've got to get my
fuel done, winter's here.

28:10.233 --> 28:12.500
Do I want to hurt
my little Sue-Cat? No.

28:12.567 --> 28:15.367
Do I have to push it to
its limits? This time, yes.

28:15.767 --> 28:16.967
So, that's good.

28:24.233 --> 28:25.700
(ENGINE STARTING)

28:26.533 --> 28:28.533
I don't like it when
my shit doesn't work.

28:28.600 --> 28:30.967
I'm gonna run that thing
till it falls apart today.

28:31.033 --> 28:34.133
I've got all this to fuel
up and I'm out of time.

28:36.167 --> 28:40.733
You start from one end,
and go around to the other.

28:43.000 --> 28:47.233
The Bobcat is running
hot, pistol hot.

28:47.633 --> 28:50.500
Erm, whether it's
thermostat, pump...

28:51.333 --> 28:53.067
Don't know, don't care.

28:53.233 --> 28:55.700
I've got to get
my barrels done.

28:56.800 --> 28:58.900
That's the name of the game,
is getting the chore done,

28:58.967 --> 29:01.800
so that this winter I don't
have to break myself doing it.

29:03.367 --> 29:06.200
All lifestyles come with
a certain amount of angst.

29:06.600 --> 29:10.167
Mine just... My angst
comes in 55-gallon drums.

29:15.833 --> 29:17.467
CHIP: I wouldn't trade
this life for anything.

29:17.767 --> 29:20.200
It doesn't make
a lot of money,
but it's very satisfying.

29:28.300 --> 29:29.967
Lot of ice going by.

29:31.100 --> 29:33.067
Won't stop caribou
from crossing, but...

29:33.133 --> 29:35.500
This doesn't seem to have
panned out very well.

29:35.700 --> 29:38.333
NARRATOR:
The Hailstones have arrived
at a familiar hunting spot

29:38.400 --> 29:40.367
and set up camp
to scout for caribou,

29:40.433 --> 29:42.767
a crucial food source
for the months ahead.

29:43.367 --> 29:45.533
We got up a couple of hours
ago after the fog left.

29:46.500 --> 29:50.033
And er, we haven't seen or
heard any caribou cross
whatsoever.

29:50.667 --> 29:53.767
So we're thinking the ones
that have been following this
trail probably petered out.

29:53.933 --> 29:56.100
But there were a lot of
fresh caribou signs downriver,

29:56.467 --> 29:59.167
so our thought is just
to, erm, move on downriver.

29:59.233 --> 30:02.100
We'll move to where the
caribou are crossing,
it's the smartest thing to do.

30:02.167 --> 30:03.333
We got the transportation.

30:03.400 --> 30:07.067
You can't always
be 100% on hunting.

30:07.400 --> 30:09.333
Lot of times you
go home with nothing.

30:09.400 --> 30:11.000
I'd like to
avoid that though.

30:12.267 --> 30:13.767
I want to go home with lots.

30:16.367 --> 30:21.967
We're gonna pack up camp and
put everything away and
head back downriver.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.567
This big sheet
of ice right here,

30:25.067 --> 30:28.233
what gets our attention is
that it's up and
out of the water,

30:28.367 --> 30:30.767
which means that it's
floating, which means it's
at least an inch thick.

30:31.800 --> 30:33.833
This other ice that we got
here is a quarter-inch thick.

30:33.900 --> 30:35.600
There's no problem,
but that right there

30:35.700 --> 30:38.700
is kind of like a "Hey,
there's some big guys in the
river to be aware of."

30:39.200 --> 30:41.800
What we don't want to do is
get ourselves stuck here.

30:41.867 --> 30:43.833
-AGNES: All set, ready?
-(CHIP SIGHS)

30:46.600 --> 30:48.000

You got that secured?

30:48.567 --> 30:50.567
All right, well, you guys make
sure the lids and stuff
are down,

30:50.633 --> 30:53.333
'cause ploughing through all
this ice and stuff
is just a bunch of crap.

30:53.400 --> 30:54.967
It's gonna knock
all this loose.

31:05.400 --> 31:07.267
(ICE CRACKING)

31:11.633 --> 31:13.333
AGNES: Stop, Chip!
CHIP: Damn it!

31:17.100 --> 31:18.900
(ENGINE SLOWING DOWN)

31:19.100 --> 31:20.833
CHIP: This ice all around
isn't doing us any favours.

31:20.900 --> 31:23.367
It burns a lot of gas to
either slow down
and plough through it,

31:23.433 --> 31:25.667
or to take the time
to go way around it.

31:25.733 --> 31:29.033
And er, I'm not into beating
up my boat,
and I'm not into wasting gas,

31:29.100 --> 31:32.100
so we're gonna get out of
this stuff here and
make a new plan.

31:33.967 --> 31:36.633
Go ahead. We're just gonna sit
here and wait a little bit,

31:36.900 --> 31:39.333
quietly, and try
to keep still,

31:39.633 --> 31:41.533
not scare any of the
animals away and hopefully

31:41.600 --> 31:43.900
they all come down the hill
and cross over here

31:43.967 --> 31:47.033
so we can try to catch some
zooming across the river.

31:52.667 --> 31:56.033
Feels like we're in
an okay spot,
but not a really good spot.

32:11.800 --> 32:13.000
CHIP: Ah.

32:13.733 --> 32:14.767
Huh.

32:15.533 --> 32:17.533
That's pretty fucking
dead if you ask me.

32:17.633 --> 32:21.000
I feel like the main herd
has already passed.

32:21.067 --> 32:24.833
-Oh. Yep. You guys just
want to go home?
-Yep.

32:24.900 --> 32:26.800
Well, the ice makes it really
hard for the caribou to swim.

32:26.867 --> 32:28.867
I mean, they're literally
cutting and beating
themselves up

32:28.933 --> 32:30.467
if they try to get
through this stuff.

32:30.533 --> 32:32.133
Caribou aren't gonna
be crossing here.

32:32.200 --> 32:34.233
As long as there's all these
big huge pans of ice,

32:34.300 --> 32:35.967
and to me they're
only getting bigger,

32:36.033 --> 32:38.433
it looks like it's time to go,
so we're gonna
get out of here.

32:42.933 --> 32:44.133
Here we go.

32:45.100 --> 32:46.700
We've decided to
get away from the ice.

32:46.767 --> 32:49.733
We're gonna pare out all the
extra heavy things
that we've got.

32:49.933 --> 32:52.567
We're just gonna lighten
the boat as best we can
since we're at home.

32:52.833 --> 32:56.967
And hopefully in the morning
start out anew and go out
and see what we can get.

32:57.800 --> 32:59.367
We're not defeated
or anything.

32:59.633 --> 33:01.167
It's just not the day for it.

33:01.233 --> 33:02.700
Maybe tomorrow
will be a better day.

33:02.967 --> 33:04.300
We'll see.

33:07.900 --> 33:09.933
GLENN:
I took the time to learn
what I needed to learn.

33:10.567 --> 33:11.867
That's why I survived.

33:22.833 --> 33:24.433
(METAL CLANGING)

33:25.167 --> 33:28.133
I cook all my food right
here on this woodstove,

33:28.200 --> 33:31.433
or outside on
an open fire, if it's warmer.

33:32.333 --> 33:35.033
I just like the atmosphere of
the woodstove
and cooking on it.

33:35.533 --> 33:36.800
You get used to it.

33:36.867 --> 33:39.233
Cut myself a couple
of nice steaks.

33:40.567 --> 33:42.700
Backstrap for dinner.
Look at that.

33:43.433 --> 33:45.033
Just clean it up a little bit.

33:45.267 --> 33:46.967
It's hard to keep it
perfectly clean.

33:47.033 --> 33:49.767
Sometimes I get a few moose
hairs on my meat
and that's all right.

33:50.100 --> 33:51.867
I can just pick 'em off.

33:51.933 --> 33:54.400
I can trim a little bit
if it's a little bit dirty.

33:54.833 --> 33:58.700
But I don't want to trim more
fat than I have to 'cause
I like eating that fat.

33:58.767 --> 34:01.833
I'll eat three or four pounds
of meat a day, that's normal.

34:01.900 --> 34:04.900
Cold out here. Got to have a
lot of meat and fat
to stay warm.

34:06.667 --> 34:09.767
There's nothing like hunting
for your own meat,
nothing like it.

34:13.933 --> 34:16.533
Everything that lives
has to die.

34:18.200 --> 34:19.667
And the way nature works,

34:21.133 --> 34:24.900
when things die, they get
consumed by something else
that's living.

34:26.833 --> 34:28.100
It's a cycle, it's natural.

34:29.233 --> 34:30.767
And people are
part of it, too,

34:30.833 --> 34:33.733
and when you're hunting
you see it up close
and personal.

34:35.467 --> 34:38.767
You're part of
that big process
whether you know it or not.

34:39.667 --> 34:42.800
But the hunter is aware
that he's part of that
cycle of life.

34:43.700 --> 34:45.967

he killed it himself.

to have finished
that in one day,

he must complete the rack
to dry and preserve the fish

36:07.433 --> 36:10.267
that will feed himself and his
sled dogs through the winter.

36:10.467 --> 36:13.067
This isn't like I'm having to
start this whole project
over again.

36:13.133 --> 36:16.100
I'm just trying to rectify the
balance problem
that I had and...

36:16.433 --> 36:20.800
And then I just pick these
fish up and slap 'em
on here and...

36:20.867 --> 36:24.767
I'm behind right now,
if I don't keep moving
I'm gonna be way behind.

For me, fear is... Fear of
failure is probably
the greatest fear for me.

with who you are, you know?

37:54.233 --> 37:55.700
You got to like yourself.

37:58.800 --> 38:00.433
All right! This looks great.

38:00.667 --> 38:01.967
This is gonna hold.

38:02.600 --> 38:05.600
Got, you know, nearly
a thousand fish here so,

38:06.133 --> 38:08.267
you know, I achieved
what I wanted to achieve.

38:08.333 --> 38:09.833
I had some hardships
along the way,

38:09.900 --> 38:12.500
but it's just a lesson
in perseverance, you know?

38:13.033 --> 38:15.767
When things aren't going good,
that's when you got to
step up, man,

38:15.833 --> 38:17.767
you got to step up
and get it done.

38:17.833 --> 38:21.633
My mind can rest that I
accomplished this and I can
move onto the next job,

38:22.100 --> 38:24.567
which now, that the
snow is coming, is many.

38:29.633 --> 38:31.400
CHIP: This is part of life.

38:31.467 --> 38:33.100
You've got to kill something
if you want to eat
and you want to live.

38:40.300 --> 38:41.533
(HUSKIES BARKING)

38:41.600 --> 38:42.833
Are you guys ready?

38:42.900 --> 38:44.467
-I'm ready.
-Yeah.

38:44.533 --> 38:46.700
It's too bad your mom doesn't
feel good enough
to follow today.

38:47.067 --> 38:49.267
-That's all right, the four of
us will get 'er done.
-Oh yeah.

38:49.567 --> 38:53.033
This morning Agnes hasn't been
feeling very well, so we
suggested she stay home.

38:53.100 --> 38:56.000
Me, Jon, Ting, we can cover
this. We've got Carol.

38:56.100 --> 38:58.467
We're pulling her out of
school for the day,
let her go hunt some more.

38:58.533 --> 39:00.233
We're a good crew.
We'll work out.

39:01.167 --> 39:02.933
-(GRUNTS)
-Jon will direct the hunt.

39:03.267 --> 39:05.833
He'll pick up any of your
wounded. You two
will do the shooting.

39:05.900 --> 39:09.400
When he's telling you "shoot",
"don't shoot",
you listen to him.

39:09.467 --> 39:12.767
You know how it is when you've
got two or three people
shooting at the same time,

39:12.833 --> 39:14.633
you have to have
control on that.

39:16.367 --> 39:19.233
Take the boat, go out, and
when darkness is coming
we'll come back.

39:19.300 --> 39:21.733
And it's gonna freeze up
the river here pretty soon.

39:21.800 --> 39:23.500
So we're trying to
beat the rut basically.

39:23.567 --> 39:25.067
And we need to come up with
a certain amount of caribou

39:25.133 --> 39:26.867
because there's a certain
amount that we eat,

39:26.933 --> 39:29.100
and other people that we
support, too, and we need
to get caribous.

39:32.200 --> 39:34.533
Yesterday where we were at,
up above Kiana,

39:34.600 --> 39:37.367
up on the main channel
of the Kobuk River,
it was icing in.

39:37.433 --> 39:40.400
So, we decided to ease on down
home, go back out again today,

39:40.467 --> 39:42.433
'cause there's no
ice down this far.

39:42.500 --> 39:44.267
The caribou aren't gonna
cross route through the ice

39:44.333 --> 39:45.900
when it's going
through the river, so

39:46.300 --> 39:49.633
we don't want to be too late.
But then again,
we don't know what we'll get.

39:50.233 --> 39:51.800
So, what we're gonna do
is we're gonna give it a try.

39:57.033 --> 39:58.800
(JON SPEAKING)

39:59.033 --> 40:00.400
Checking for some tracks...

40:08.767 --> 40:10.867
This is always a good place
to park and have a look.

40:19.600 --> 40:21.067
There ain't nothing here.

40:21.500 --> 40:24.600
Migration is going basically
from the north to the south,

40:24.667 --> 40:27.933
but to bypass this place they
have to swim east to west, so

40:28.167 --> 40:30.233
we're just gonna,
just keep looking, I guess.

40:33.400 --> 40:36.667
We're going to a place called
Kugluktuk, where the delta
starts to separate.

40:37.367 --> 40:39.500
We're looking at all the
caribou trails over here.

40:39.967 --> 40:41.967
I want to find some caribou
that are making tracks,

40:42.033 --> 40:44.033
I don't want to just see
the tracks of caribou.

40:56.267 --> 40:58.400
We didn't see any today.
And that happens.

40:58.800 --> 41:00.200
It's just part of hunting.

41:00.267 --> 41:01.767
It's getting later in the day.

41:01.833 --> 41:04.167
Just make our way back down
Noorvik and hunt our way home.

41:04.233 --> 41:05.833
We're easing on out of here.

41:06.100 --> 41:07.833
Let's hope we see something
on the way, huh?

41:09.700 --> 41:12.367
If we're not gonna
catch caribou,
then we're gonna have to...

41:15.067 --> 41:18.100
We're gonna have to have a
hard, cold winter
for the first few months.

41:19.367 --> 41:20.533
It's pretty hard.

41:20.600 --> 41:22.033
It doesn't feel good.

41:22.100 --> 41:24.767
It's hard to be unsuccessful,
especially on so many trips.

41:26.500 --> 41:29.633
CHIP: Never, in my life,
have I ever been without
caribou at this time of year,

41:29.700 --> 41:30.967
or had this happen.

41:31.033 --> 41:32.633
That just ain't
the way it is right now.

41:32.700 --> 41:33.900
Sometimes you go
home with nothing.

41:34.600 --> 41:37.533
Oh, well, that's the
attitude you got to take.

41:37.600 --> 41:39.933
If you don't, you just get
upset and that doesn't help.

41:40.200 --> 41:43.200
Sometimes nature takes control
in the strangest ways,

41:43.267 --> 41:45.867
and that's part of living
in the Arctic.
You just keep at it.

41:45.933 --> 41:47.867
Hunting isn't always
a sure thing,
that's why it's "hunting".

41:52.633 --> 41:55.633
SUE: I don't want to get
caught with my panties down,
I got to get my work done.

41:55.767 --> 41:58.300
Commando is no way
to get caught by nature.

42:03.333 --> 42:05.267
(ENGINE ROARING)

42:05.767 --> 42:08.300
Well this is the last barrel.

42:08.367 --> 42:10.033
The sun's just getting
ready to go down.

42:10.100 --> 42:11.867
I've been at it since
the sun came up.

42:15.367 --> 42:16.433
All right.

42:17.733 --> 42:19.200
There you go.

42:21.367 --> 42:23.467
Three-thousand gallons of fun.

42:25.000 --> 42:29.033
So, you know, snapping a
little bung down
on this one is kinda,

42:29.400 --> 42:32.667
snapping together one of the
big puzzle pieces of winter.

42:33.100 --> 42:34.700
I got the Bobcat going.

42:34.767 --> 42:38.500
It didn't want to run,
and it's not running well.

42:38.567 --> 42:40.500
But I did manage
to get it going,

42:40.567 --> 42:45.467
which enabled me to get fuel
from my storage containers

42:46.133 --> 42:49.233
to my fuel barrels,
over by my heat tank.

42:49.300 --> 42:53.667
Er, what that'll do for me is
that enables me to,
very short distance,

42:53.733 --> 42:56.333
I can hand pump that
fuel into my heat tank,

42:56.400 --> 42:59.400
but it allows me to have heat
for the nine,
10 months of winter

42:59.467 --> 43:01.133
in between fuel deliveries.

43:02.333 --> 43:06.600
Preparation is just 90%
of thriving out here.

43:06.667 --> 43:10.033
It's not easy no matter
what style of life you choose

43:10.100 --> 43:13.700
but for me,
it's the wind in my face,

43:13.800 --> 43:15.433
the chill up my spine

43:15.500 --> 43:17.800
and the thrill of not knowing
what's out there

43:17.867 --> 43:20.100
that keeps me living here.
