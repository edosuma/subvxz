00:14.505 --> 00:17.303
Hello?
Donna, it's you!

00:17.375 --> 00:19.366
How's California?

00:19.443 --> 00:21.536
Have you run into
Johnny Carson yet?

00:22.546 --> 00:26.312
No. I read
he won't eat corn.

00:26.384 --> 00:30.616
What? Oh, Eric. Oh. No. No.
I know he wants to talk to you.

00:30.688 --> 00:33.020
He hasn't heard from you
all summer. I'll get him.

00:33.090 --> 00:35.285
Eric! Ow!

00:36.293 --> 00:39.387
Eric. Eric, are you
in the bathroom?

00:39.463 --> 00:41.658
<i>( Eric )</i>
<i>Yes.</i>

00:41.732 --> 00:43.825
- Well, get off, because-
- <i>Mom? Mom.</i>

00:43.901 --> 00:46.631
<i>When this door is closed,</i>
<i>it's my sacred alone time.</i>

00:46.704 --> 00:49.673
<i>Okay?</i>
<i>Think of it as church.</i>

00:49.740 --> 00:52.436
- But, I-
- <i>Mom.!</i>

00:53.444 --> 00:55.435
Fine.

00:55.513 --> 00:57.845
Gets up at noon,
sits on the toilet until dinner-

00:57.915 --> 00:59.906
What kind of summer
is that?

01:41.425 --> 01:45.191
Well, you made me lose
my concentration.

01:48.766 --> 01:51.326
Now I'm gonna have to go
back there in about an hour.

01:53.204 --> 01:56.071
I just wanted to tell you
Donna called.

01:56.140 --> 01:58.938
<i>Her number's on the pad</i>
<i>by the kitchen phone.</i>

01:59.009 --> 02:01.000
What?

02:02.913 --> 02:06.178
Why wouldn't you
say something?

02:06.250 --> 02:09.514
And I'm staying out of this,
but if you'd eat a little bran...

02:09.586 --> 02:12.215
you could've taken
that call yourself.

02:12.289 --> 02:14.280
( Whistling )

02:16.427 --> 02:18.520
- Where's the notepad?
- Here.

02:18.596 --> 02:20.587
Quit twitchin'.

02:23.300 --> 02:25.700
What? There's no number.
Dad.

02:27.438 --> 02:29.429
<i>( Whistling Continues )</i>

02:29.507 --> 02:31.532
Step away
from the vehicle.

02:34.845 --> 02:37.712
Isn't it a little early
for you to be hopped up?

02:40.084 --> 02:42.552
- Empty your pockets, now.
- Get the hell out of my pants!

02:42.620 --> 02:44.713
Got it.

02:48.859 --> 02:51.555
What the hell
is wrong with him?

02:52.963 --> 02:56.194
He has low self-esteem
because you are too domineering.

02:59.270 --> 03:01.329
Red, you're gonna let Forman
get away with that, man?

03:01.405 --> 03:03.396
He just felt you up.

03:04.975 --> 03:07.466
Where's the foot in the ass?

03:07.545 --> 03:09.945
- Unless you're getting too old.
- Shut it.

03:11.181 --> 03:13.206
And go shave that thing.

03:13.284 --> 03:15.718
You look like
a damn Hungarian.

03:25.863 --> 03:28.024
Oh, my God,
it's ringing.

03:29.166 --> 03:31.361
And Eric chickens out again.

03:31.435 --> 03:33.665
Quack, quack, quack.

03:33.737 --> 03:36.035
Forman, what's the problem?

03:36.106 --> 03:38.097
It's just-

03:38.175 --> 03:40.700
I want to tell her to come home,
that I miss her...

03:40.778 --> 03:43.338
that... I love her.

03:43.414 --> 03:47.544
I mean, it's too much
to say over the phone.

03:47.618 --> 03:49.609
Look, Eric,
just write her a letter.

03:49.687 --> 03:51.951
That's how I broke up
with Michael.

03:52.957 --> 03:54.948
Yeah. I was able
to take my time...

03:55.025 --> 03:57.789
and come up with
good synonyms for...

03:57.861 --> 03:59.852
''cowardly,
won't-marry-me loser...

03:59.930 --> 04:02.057
run-away-to-California
jackass.''

04:04.068 --> 04:08.596
Jackie, I'm charismatic
in person.

04:08.672 --> 04:12.164
I've got these
awesome hand gestures.

04:15.179 --> 04:19.774
And, uh, I kind of, like, waggle
my eyebrows when I talk.

04:21.285 --> 04:23.776
Wait. You do that
on purpose?

04:27.057 --> 04:29.548
Thanks, you guys.
That's-That's helpful.

04:29.627 --> 04:31.959
( Continues )

04:32.029 --> 04:34.463
You know what?
That's it. I'm going.

04:34.531 --> 04:39.366
I'll just show up in California
and, like, blow her mind.

04:39.436 --> 04:41.563
Yeah. I mean...

04:41.639 --> 04:45.166
when the Empire killed Luke Skywalker's
aunt and uncle, did he just call 'em up?

04:45.242 --> 04:47.767
- Oh, God.
- Oh.

04:47.845 --> 04:49.904
No. He hopped on
the <i>Millennium Falcon...</i>

04:49.980 --> 04:52.540
and he paid a little visit
to the Death Star.

04:57.287 --> 04:59.414
Wait a minute.

04:59.490 --> 05:01.754
Do chickens go quack,
or did I mess that up?

05:10.601 --> 05:13.161
I sat at my mom's house
for three hours.

05:13.237 --> 05:15.228
Eric still hasn't called.

05:15.305 --> 05:18.604
Hey, you know what might
make you feel better?

05:18.676 --> 05:21.611
Playing pinball...
over there.

05:23.614 --> 05:25.605
I don't have any quarters.

05:31.755 --> 05:34.690
Hey, Kelso.
You know what might help me?

05:34.758 --> 05:37.693
If you could tell me
how you got overJackie.

05:38.696 --> 05:41.290
You rememberJackie,
don't you?

05:41.365 --> 05:43.959
- Who's Jackie?
- Uh...

05:44.968 --> 05:47.459
Jackie was my dog.

05:49.406 --> 05:52.466
She died in
a Big Wheel accident.

05:52.543 --> 05:56.001
No, Annette.
I meantJackie, his ex-girlfriend.

05:56.080 --> 05:58.708
Uh, also dead.

05:58.782 --> 06:02.047
- She's not dead.
- What's going on here?

06:03.053 --> 06:06.250
- Why are you lying to me?
- No, no. I'm not lying,Jackie-

06:06.323 --> 06:09.588
Annette.
Look, baby.

06:11.729 --> 06:14.129
Well, my work here is done.

06:16.467 --> 06:19.459
You want to go
to California to get Donna?

06:19.536 --> 06:21.731
You can't go to California.

06:21.805 --> 06:24.103
But I have to tell Donna
I love her...

06:24.174 --> 06:26.335
and that she should be
back here with me.

06:26.410 --> 06:28.503
Oh. Well, that's sweet.

06:29.947 --> 06:33.747
I think it would sound
especially good on the phone.

06:33.817 --> 06:37.218
But don't call till after 7:00
when the rates go down.

06:37.287 --> 06:40.279
Well, I can't call her.
I mean...

06:42.993 --> 06:46.156
- did Luke Skywalker-
- Oh. Would you stop.

06:48.265 --> 06:51.200
Luke Skywalker this.
Luke Skywalker that.

06:51.268 --> 06:54.135
I'm sick of hearing
about that little fruit.

06:59.610 --> 07:02.374
Luke Skywalker is <i>not</i>-

07:03.814 --> 07:05.975
He and Leia clearly- I-

07:12.689 --> 07:15.214
Mom, Dad.

07:16.827 --> 07:18.818
- This is important.
- <i>( Red ) No.</i>

07:18.896 --> 07:20.887
No California.

07:20.964 --> 07:23.159
You know what's important?
School.

07:23.233 --> 07:26.600
You're gonna be a senior,
and you need to buckle down.

07:26.670 --> 07:29.468
Luke Skywalker
would've buckled down.

07:39.483 --> 07:43.249
Forman, there's a flight to California
in four hours, and you're on it.

07:43.320 --> 07:45.788
Before you get all gushy,
we didn't pay for it.

07:45.856 --> 07:48.188
We stole the money
from your secret stash...

07:50.027 --> 07:52.518
in the Scooby-Doo thermos.

07:52.596 --> 07:55.156
You guys know
about Scooby-Doo?

07:55.232 --> 07:57.223
It was a good try,
but you should have known...

07:57.301 --> 07:59.963
that eventually I would need
to take some cocoa on the go.

08:03.707 --> 08:05.971
Well, thanks, you guys...

08:06.043 --> 08:08.705
but... my parents will kill me.

08:08.779 --> 08:11.145
- No, Eric. We'll cover for you.
- Yeah. Believe me.

08:11.215 --> 08:14.013
I got no problem
foolin' whitey.

08:15.085 --> 08:18.577
Hyde, <i>you're</i> white.

08:19.790 --> 08:22.486
( Scoffs )
Barely.

08:22.559 --> 08:25.323
Eric, if you love her,
you have to go.

08:26.964 --> 08:30.400
You're right.
I'm gonna do this.

08:31.468 --> 08:33.458
Damn it, I'm goin'.
I gotta go pack.

08:33.537 --> 08:35.869
Hey, let me help.
I love putting together outfits.

08:40.177 --> 08:43.544
- Finally.
- Yeah. I thought they'd never leave.

08:47.017 --> 08:50.783
You know, Steven, it was really nice
of you to get that ticket for Eric.

08:50.854 --> 08:54.051
This usually works a whole lot better
when you don't talk.

08:59.407 --> 09:01.398
Look, Annette.

09:01.476 --> 09:04.377
You're way more important to me
than Jackie ever was.

09:04.445 --> 09:07.778
I mean, you're blonde.
You're beautiful.

09:07.849 --> 09:10.317
You practically never
wear a whole shirt.

09:10.385 --> 09:14.719
I'm sorry. It's just the thought
of you with somebody else...

09:14.789 --> 09:16.882
got me really upset.

09:16.958 --> 09:19.188
I'm really upset.

09:20.194 --> 09:22.253
Which is why I propose...

09:22.330 --> 09:25.766
that we do something
special and romantic.

09:25.833 --> 09:28.563
Let's do it.

09:28.636 --> 09:31.036
Michael, I don't do that.

09:32.040 --> 09:34.668
- I'm a virgin.
- What?

09:34.742 --> 09:37.643
A coincidence.

09:37.712 --> 09:39.703
Me too.

09:39.781 --> 09:42.875
So let's do it.
First-timers, yeah.

09:42.951 --> 09:45.818
You know what?
I'm gonna go cool off.

09:50.925 --> 09:52.916
- Kelso-
- Ah-ah, one second.

09:54.295 --> 09:56.422
She's coolin' off.

10:06.507 --> 10:10.307
Look. I was wondering if you and Annette
could maybe discuss your plans...

10:10.378 --> 10:13.836
to do it or not do it
when I'm not around.

10:13.915 --> 10:17.407
But you're never not around.
You're always here.

10:17.485 --> 10:19.578
You're like a carbuncle.

10:19.654 --> 10:22.714
Kelso, you don't even know
what a carbuncle is.

10:22.790 --> 10:26.191
Well, I know it's gross,
and it doesn't go away.

10:27.996 --> 10:30.658
Okay. I'm sorry.
It's just...

10:30.732 --> 10:33.098
I don't know anybody else.

10:34.502 --> 10:37.300
California people are freaks.

10:37.372 --> 10:41.308
Like that guy.
You can't smoke that out here!

10:44.946 --> 10:46.937
I miss Eric.

10:50.151 --> 10:52.779
That guy even
looks like Eric.

10:52.854 --> 10:55.880
Oh, my God.
Eric!

10:56.958 --> 10:58.892
Donna!

11:32.593 --> 11:35.027
Kelso, what the hell
are you doing?

11:35.096 --> 11:37.394
Winning.

11:37.465 --> 11:39.865
I oughta-

11:42.437 --> 11:45.736
I- I can't believe
you came here for me.

11:45.807 --> 11:47.798
Of course I did.

11:47.875 --> 11:50.969
Donna, I love you.

11:51.045 --> 11:53.673
And I have so much to say, but I-

11:57.985 --> 12:00.317
You guys can French all you want.
I totally won.

12:11.699 --> 12:14.031
- Hey, Red.
- Good day, Mr. Red.

12:14.102 --> 12:17.003
Wait a minute.
Where's the other idiot?

12:19.140 --> 12:21.267
Other idiot?

12:21.342 --> 12:24.311
Do we know another idiot?

12:24.378 --> 12:27.472
- Where's Eric?
- Where's Eric?

12:27.548 --> 12:30.608
Where are you, man,
and who wants to know?

12:30.685 --> 12:32.676
The U.S. government,
that's who.

12:32.754 --> 12:36.417
Like, I read by 1 984, the government
will have tracking devices on all of us.

12:36.491 --> 12:39.289
And after that, they're gonna
jam electrodes in our brains...

12:39.360 --> 12:41.453
so they can read our memories.

12:42.663 --> 12:44.654
Damn U.S. government.

12:46.968 --> 12:49.163
''Damn U.S. government''?

12:49.237 --> 12:53.936
Without our government,
you'd be stuck in Siberia now...

12:54.008 --> 12:57.774
suckin' the juice
from a rotten commie potato.

12:58.946 --> 13:00.937
Let me tell you something.

13:01.015 --> 13:03.176
If the U.S. government...

13:03.251 --> 13:06.914
decides to stick
a tracking device up your ass...

13:08.189 --> 13:11.056
you say, ''Thank you...

13:11.125 --> 13:13.320
and God bless America.''

13:16.998 --> 13:18.989
He's so easy.

13:20.835 --> 13:23.804
And then after Michael
threw up, I told him...

13:23.871 --> 13:26.863
''You're not supposed to eat
the plastic wrapping.''

13:29.343 --> 13:31.334
And that's how we met.

13:31.412 --> 13:33.346
Wow. That's-

13:33.414 --> 13:35.575
That's like <i>Love Story.</i>

13:37.819 --> 13:40.583
Wow. I wish there was
more to talk about.

13:44.792 --> 13:46.783
Bye.

13:49.797 --> 13:51.788
Would you look at her.

13:51.866 --> 13:55.063
She's so hot,
she could be a robot.

13:56.737 --> 13:58.728
''A robot''?

13:59.941 --> 14:01.932
Whatever. Look.

14:02.009 --> 14:04.136
You have the van,
and we want to go home.

14:04.212 --> 14:06.737
No. Uh-uh.
I can't leave Annette. I love her.

14:06.814 --> 14:09.476
You don't love her.

14:09.550 --> 14:11.643
I love parts of her.

14:13.821 --> 14:16.346
I mean, unlikeJackie,
she believes in me.

14:16.424 --> 14:18.654
Okay. I told Annette
I wanted to be an astronaut...

14:18.726 --> 14:20.717
and she said that
she thought I could.

14:20.795 --> 14:23.821
To be fair, she wants
to be a lady astronaut.

14:25.466 --> 14:28.026
I mean, come on, guys.
Just give me a few hours. Okay?

14:28.102 --> 14:31.367
If- Look. This girl is beautiful,
and she believes in me.

14:31.439 --> 14:34.602
And if I can get her to put out,
she'll be three out of three.

14:35.943 --> 14:37.934
Right now, she's only
two out of three.

14:38.012 --> 14:40.480
And I'm sorry, but 50%
just ain't gonna cut it.

14:46.220 --> 14:49.018
Okay. Look, Steven.
These last few weeks with you...

14:49.090 --> 14:51.285
have been really dirty
and really wrong.

14:54.028 --> 14:57.725
Jackie, talking is for people
who have something in common.

15:05.473 --> 15:07.964
Oh, good God.

15:08.042 --> 15:11.808
You kids switch partners
more than square dancers.

15:15.316 --> 15:18.649
Uh, no. It's not what you think.
We're not together.

15:19.787 --> 15:22.654
Then what's going on
in my kitchen?

15:23.724 --> 15:25.658
Um...

15:27.228 --> 15:29.389
Eric's in California.

15:36.170 --> 15:38.832
Jackie, you just
totally burned Forman.

15:38.906 --> 15:40.897
That was so badass.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.101
So, Annette,
I'm just saying...

15:45.179 --> 15:47.204
that I'm leaving
in a couple hours.

15:47.281 --> 15:49.272
So I guess the question is...

15:49.350 --> 15:53.286
what, oh, what can two virgins do
to kill an afternoon?

15:55.389 --> 15:57.789
Well, there is something.

15:57.858 --> 16:00.691
But it's kind of wet and dirty.

16:01.696 --> 16:04.995
Sold!

16:06.867 --> 16:09.597
Having fun?

16:09.670 --> 16:15.609
No. I mean, these are
our last hours together...

16:15.676 --> 16:18.645
and you're not nude.

16:20.014 --> 16:23.245
So all you care about is sex?

16:23.317 --> 16:25.615
I thought there was
more to you than that.

16:25.686 --> 16:28.052
But there isn't.

16:29.123 --> 16:32.684
But there is.
I believe in you.

16:32.760 --> 16:35.593
- Stop saying that.
- But I do.

16:35.663 --> 16:39.724
Damn. All right.
Start digging the moat.

16:44.105 --> 16:46.596
<i>( Waves Crashing )</i>

16:57.952 --> 17:01.251
I was so scared that I'd never feel
like this with you again.

17:03.357 --> 17:05.621
I mean...

17:05.693 --> 17:09.060
Eric, after last year-

17:09.130 --> 17:11.428
- Donna.
- I-

17:11.499 --> 17:14.332
About Casey and all that stuff?

17:15.336 --> 17:18.896
I don't care. Okay?

17:18.973 --> 17:21.203
I just want to be with you.

17:23.477 --> 17:27.413
You know, all summer
I hated California.

17:27.481 --> 17:30.416
But now that you're here,
it's, like, amazing.

17:32.653 --> 17:35.144
This is the most romantic night
of my whole life.

17:35.222 --> 17:38.191
Yeah, I know.
Me too.

17:41.962 --> 17:43.953
I have sand in my crack.

17:45.032 --> 17:47.364
- Yeah, me too.
- Oh.

17:49.336 --> 17:51.634
Eric, I want to go home.

17:58.012 --> 18:00.606
( Eric Chuckles )

18:02.283 --> 18:05.980
Hey, Kelso.
How was your date with Annette?

18:06.053 --> 18:08.078
We went to a carnival.

18:08.155 --> 18:10.453
I won her six stuffed animals.

18:10.524 --> 18:12.549
Then we shared a giant pretzel.

18:12.626 --> 18:15.925
And then I walked her home,
and she gave me a good-night kiss...

18:15.996 --> 18:17.987
on the cheek.

18:18.065 --> 18:21.398
You know, in Wisconsin...

18:21.469 --> 18:24.336
if you win a girl
a giant purple rhinoceros...

18:24.405 --> 18:26.396
she puts out!

18:26.474 --> 18:28.465
( Pops )

18:30.644 --> 18:33.636
<i>( Engine Rewing )</i>

18:36.050 --> 18:38.041
<i>( Horn Honks )</i>

18:39.120 --> 18:41.748
So, my folks have
no idea I was gone.

18:44.024 --> 18:47.152
- No idea. You're golden.
- Ah.

18:47.228 --> 18:50.288
- Oh. Hyde!
- Hey.

18:50.364 --> 18:52.730
You got a beard!

18:54.068 --> 18:57.265
You look so... old.

18:57.338 --> 18:59.704
Of course I look old, man.
Party more than you.

18:59.773 --> 19:02.503
Work more, drank more,
and slept with way more chicks.

19:03.978 --> 19:05.969
I'm exhausted, man.

19:06.046 --> 19:08.742
Fez, my little man!

19:08.816 --> 19:10.807
How was your summer?

19:10.885 --> 19:13.911
Well, I saw a boob and a half
down by the pool.

19:17.024 --> 19:19.720
Yeah.
Pool boob. Nice.

19:20.761 --> 19:23.229
Look. Donna,
I know you're nervous...

19:23.297 --> 19:25.891
about seeing people at school
after running away and all...

19:25.966 --> 19:28.526
but I want you to know
it's all under control.

19:28.602 --> 19:31.503
I told everyone you went
away to have a baby.

19:32.573 --> 19:35.303
- What?
- Yeah. It was badass.

19:35.376 --> 19:37.367
Oh, yeah.
I say badass now.

19:41.282 --> 19:43.978
Hi, Daddy.

19:44.051 --> 19:46.042
Don't you ''Daddy'' me.

19:46.120 --> 19:48.611
Although it does sound good
to hear those words again.

19:48.689 --> 19:50.680
- Bob.
- Right.

19:50.758 --> 19:52.749
You're in big trouble, young lady.

19:52.826 --> 19:55.522
Now get home now.
Move.

19:58.098 --> 20:00.089
Well...

20:00.167 --> 20:03.159
I guess that's what happens when you,
uh, disobey your parents, huh?

20:07.541 --> 20:10.806
<i>Hey, why the long faces?</i>

20:10.878 --> 20:13.108
Did you think that I-
No, no.

20:13.180 --> 20:17.241
Funny story. True story.
I'm walkin' home from the library...

20:17.318 --> 20:19.513
and who should drive by?

20:20.521 --> 20:22.614
Kelso and Donna.

20:22.690 --> 20:24.954
Back from California.

20:25.025 --> 20:27.516
Where they were.
Not me.

20:30.297 --> 20:32.492
Oh, hey?
They know.

20:38.439 --> 20:41.499
What do you have
to say for yourself?

20:43.811 --> 20:45.802
I-

20:48.716 --> 20:50.877
I brought you a seashell.

20:51.952 --> 20:54.512
Just get in the house.

20:54.588 --> 20:57.489
( Mock Sobbing )

20:57.558 --> 21:00.789
Do you have any idea
how much trouble you're in?

21:00.861 --> 21:04.763
Oh, yeah.
And it was worth it.

21:11.472 --> 21:13.838
- <i>( Car Chase On TV)</i>
- Oh, not this again.

21:13.907 --> 21:17.934
I told you,
it gives me needs.

21:18.012 --> 21:20.606
Fine.
We'll be upstairs.

21:20.681 --> 21:23.377
Too late.

21:23.450 --> 21:26.613
- Why are we watching this? It's stupid.
- You're stupid.

21:26.687 --> 21:28.678
Man, I've been gone all summer...

21:28.756 --> 21:30.883
and I get back,
and everything is just the same.

21:30.958 --> 21:33.654
I guess nothing ever
changes around here.
