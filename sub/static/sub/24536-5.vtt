and Hope isn’t given a chance
to save her,

12:06.900 --> 12:08.162
she will not forgive you.

12:08.205 --> 12:10.730
And if I impose this shame
upon my daughter

12:10.773 --> 12:13.994
and then they kill her mother
anyway?

12:16.935 --> 12:19.141
I won’t forgive myself.

12:26.762 --> 12:29.721
[both chuckle]

12:30.477 --> 12:31.531
You should really
lock your door.

12:31.555 --> 12:33.117
You know that, right?

12:33.258 --> 12:34.781
Pretty sure I did, Roman.

12:35.053 --> 12:35.703
Okay.

12:35.832 --> 12:37.878
Well, then next time use
a lock I can’t pick.

12:41.151 --> 12:43.850
So what’s the deal with you
and your out-of-town visitor?

12:44.799 --> 12:45.982
She’s my aunt.

12:46.486 --> 12:47.984
And why do you care?

12:48.432 --> 12:50.479
Hey, I’m just curious.Hmm.

12:50.656 --> 12:52.397
Hmm?

12:59.303 --> 13:01.900
Why are you so interested in me?

13:02.239 --> 13:04.546
- In truth?
- No, lie to me.

13:06.943 --> 13:08.056
Okay.

13:08.214 --> 13:09.345
A Mikaelson.

13:09.930 --> 13:11.453
Daughter of an Original,

13:11.478 --> 13:13.494
which is supposed
to be impossible.

13:13.764 --> 13:15.816
Dad’s a vampire,
Mom’s a werewolf,

13:15.841 --> 13:17.191
lineage of witches.

13:18.330 --> 13:20.400
I’m interested in you because...

13:21.207 --> 13:22.773
you’re the most interesting.

13:23.103 --> 13:24.548
Other than you, of course.

13:24.720 --> 13:26.196
You don’t know anything
about me.

13:26.240 --> 13:28.895
Hmm, which is, I’m sure,
exactly how you like it.Maybe.

13:29.516 --> 13:30.952
How about this?

13:31.884 --> 13:33.551
You tell me something about you,

13:33.595 --> 13:36.990
and I won’t go to Alaric
with breaking and entering.

13:41.940 --> 13:43.049
I once pissed some people off

13:43.073 --> 13:45.597
and ended up desiccated
in a cave.

13:46.352 --> 13:47.641
Desiccated?

13:47.696 --> 13:48.871
Yeah.

13:49.166 --> 13:50.264
What was that like?

13:50.564 --> 13:52.483
[sighs]

13:52.527 --> 13:55.835
It was... bad.

13:58.078 --> 14:00.501
But then the pain
took over and...

14:01.048 --> 14:03.244
I just lost track of everything.

14:03.973 --> 14:05.453
Everything but time.

14:06.822 --> 14:09.189
How long were you in there?

14:10.345 --> 14:14.025
Long enough to replay the first
pain-free 16 years of my life

14:14.515 --> 14:17.830
several times over
before moving on to my 17th.

14:20.921 --> 14:24.759
An ancient bad boy vampire
with a damaged soul.

14:26.169 --> 14:28.258
How positively...
Literary?

14:29.134 --> 14:30.134
Cliché.

14:30.650 --> 14:31.650
Oh.

14:31.786 --> 14:32.579
Ouch.

14:32.697 --> 14:34.395
[laughs]

14:39.318 --> 14:41.054
Look at you.

14:41.097 --> 14:44.579
The vampire supplicant
delivering poison in a bag.

14:45.763 --> 14:47.930
It’s a hangover cocktail
I keep behind the bar.

14:47.974 --> 14:50.063
Electrolytes, five "B" vitamins,

14:50.106 --> 14:51.978
a little glutathione.

14:54.009 --> 14:55.680
Klaus told you to show me pity?

14:55.705 --> 14:56.706
No.

14:57.099 --> 14:58.286
My choice.

14:59.270 --> 15:00.890
Guess I’m hoping

15:00.915 --> 15:04.396
showing you a little kindness
convinces you to let Hayley go.

15:04.895 --> 15:05.992
She’s a good soul, Greta.

15:06.778 --> 15:09.343
And none of what happened
was her fault.

15:11.317 --> 15:13.086
Not directly.

15:14.208 --> 15:17.133
But we had years of peace, Josh.

15:17.895 --> 15:20.198
All of which ended because
her loathsome daughter

15:20.223 --> 15:22.138
sullied the evolutionary pool.

15:22.869 --> 15:25.741
Poppy was a good soul, too,
wasn’t she?

15:27.952 --> 15:29.563
MARCEL:
Josh.

15:40.091 --> 15:41.702
Have you gone insane?

15:41.727 --> 15:43.029
She’s no good to us dead,

15:43.072 --> 15:44.247
and the drip will only help

15:44.291 --> 15:46.007
clear the vervain
from her system.

15:46.032 --> 15:48.094
And honestly, Marcel, she...

15:48.820 --> 15:49.992
she’s kind of got a point.

15:50.586 --> 15:52.647
Choose your next words
very carefully.

15:52.690 --> 15:54.344
Come on, dude.

15:54.388 --> 15:57.130
Look, I don’t know exactly what
your new deal is with Klaus,

15:57.173 --> 15:58.740
but think about it.

15:58.783 --> 16:01.699
Binding Hope means a safe
Hayley, no more hybrids, and...

16:01.743 --> 16:04.876
And the Mikaelsons go back
to where they came from, right?

16:04.920 --> 16:07.053
Oh, believe me, I have gamed
this out already.

16:07.096 --> 16:10.317
Okay, so, not that I’m in any
position to give advice here,

16:10.360 --> 16:14.582
but maybe, just maybe, you side
with the community on this one.

16:17.742 --> 16:19.065
A question.

16:19.813 --> 16:21.893
How do you feel
about your skull, Josh?

16:22.914 --> 16:24.244
I’m pretty attached to it.

16:24.287 --> 16:25.567
Then stop engaging
with the enemy

16:25.593 --> 16:29.205
and keep your damn opinions
to yourself.

16:31.077 --> 16:33.644
You want to talk to me about
the guy with the camera?

16:35.289 --> 16:37.170
He’s come for me before...

16:37.879 --> 16:39.272
to watch me.

16:39.297 --> 16:40.608
Stalk me.

16:40.651 --> 16:42.001
Sometimes to bring me back.

16:42.512 --> 16:44.035
Bring you back to where?

16:44.493 --> 16:45.973
It doesn’t matter.

16:47.136 --> 16:49.051
Then why are you packing?

16:50.031 --> 16:52.620
Look, all those times
that I’ve said

16:52.663 --> 16:55.405
that there are things in my past
that I prefer to forget...

16:57.493 --> 16:59.016
...the man with the camera,

16:59.328 --> 17:00.106
he’s part of those things.

17:00.149 --> 17:02.195
So, problem solved. He’s dead.

17:02.238 --> 17:03.238
[chuckles]

17:03.727 --> 17:05.589
They’ll send a replacement.

17:06.539 --> 17:07.635
Who is "they"?

17:09.125 --> 17:10.961
Who is "they," Antoinette?

17:11.414 --> 17:12.640
AUGUST:
Yes.

17:12.683 --> 17:14.685
I proudly participated

17:14.729 --> 17:16.992
in the thinning
of the werewolves.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.777
Decapitated some 90
with my own hands.

17:19.820 --> 17:21.127
"Thinning"?

17:21.848 --> 17:23.215
That’s a convenient euphemism.

17:23.856 --> 17:26.088
I’m simply ridding us
of the mongrels who diminish us.

17:26.132 --> 17:27.133
Mongrels?

17:28.106 --> 17:29.396
Inferior scourges.

17:30.176 --> 17:32.964
Hardly the apex predators
born of Viking stock

17:33.008 --> 17:34.314
like you and I, friend.

17:34.357 --> 17:37.317
No, you and I are quite
different, friend.

17:37.360 --> 17:39.406
A fact which I feel I’ll
have to educate you on.

17:39.449 --> 17:42.974
I believe what my brother
is trying to say is that you

17:44.492 --> 17:45.492
are a runt.

17:46.594 --> 17:48.850
You are a runt amidst
a species of leviathans.

17:49.805 --> 17:51.722
I recommend you not give me
any further reason

17:51.766 --> 17:54.725
to stake that feeble,
incurvated sternum of yours.

17:54.769 --> 17:57.989
This is the first and last
warning I will give you.

18:05.532 --> 18:07.839
Time to go, Antoinette.

18:11.880 --> 18:13.838
Yes, Father.

18:34.644 --> 18:37.430
You shouldn’t underestimate
the movement.

18:39.410 --> 18:41.281
We will not fail.

18:41.597 --> 18:43.165
You know, history is littered

18:43.209 --> 18:46.000
with eugenicists
who overstate their sway.

18:46.328 --> 18:49.519
The Khmer Rouge, the Hutu,
the Turks in Armenia.

18:50.055 --> 18:51.143
All of whom

18:51.168 --> 18:52.696
left death and suffering
in their wake

18:52.740 --> 18:56.222
and all of whom buckled under
the weight of their own hatred.

18:57.538 --> 18:58.974
Still...

19:00.218 --> 19:02.290
...if you’re
feeling confident,

19:02.315 --> 19:06.406
tell me the names
of your co-conspirators.

19:07.546 --> 19:08.898
Sorry.

19:09.713 --> 19:11.802
Tank’s not quite empty yet.

19:15.435 --> 19:19.245
You know, August was
very weak and very small.

19:19.677 --> 19:21.247
And yet he spawned a crusade

19:21.290 --> 19:23.249
that lasted a hundred years.

19:23.292 --> 19:24.946
I don’t see a crusade.

19:24.989 --> 19:29.733
I see a lone woman grasping to
justify her last gasps of hate.

19:30.839 --> 19:34.605
And I see a man
who knows that’s a lie.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.264
But what you can’t figure out

19:38.845 --> 19:41.050
is how many of us there are.

19:41.397 --> 19:45.575
And just how deeply we have
infected your world.

19:48.448 --> 19:51.407
ANTOINETTE:
I have wanted

19:51.451 --> 19:54.236
to tell you more about our past,

19:54.280 --> 19:56.586
but I was afraid
of how you’d react.

19:59.857 --> 20:02.113
I was thinking we
could head east.

20:02.623 --> 20:05.726
Someone once told me Shanghai
is a safe place to hide out.

20:05.769 --> 20:08.468
Yeah, feel free to send me
a postcard.

20:09.283 --> 20:11.079
You gave me a ring, Elijah.

20:12.173 --> 20:13.234
You asked me to marry you.

20:13.259 --> 20:15.243
You spent the last seven years
lying to me.

20:15.478 --> 20:16.547
That’s not fair.

20:16.572 --> 20:19.174
How could you not tell me that
you and I knew each other?

20:19.677 --> 20:20.958
Because we barely met

20:21.002 --> 20:22.612
once or twice in passing.

20:22.656 --> 20:24.373
And the part where my brother
and your father have an entire

20:24.397 --> 20:26.486
history together, you neglected
to tell me that, too.

20:26.529 --> 20:28.792
Because I know how this ends. [scoffs]

20:29.357 --> 20:31.447
I keep my secrets and
you’ll walk out that door,

20:31.491 --> 20:33.431
but that’s still better than...

20:34.363 --> 20:37.975
telling you the truth and
having you hate me forever.

20:46.910 --> 20:48.818
Enjoy Shanghai.

20:54.905 --> 20:57.604
[door slams]

20:59.490 --> 21:01.800
Marcel, I have a question.

21:01.825 --> 21:03.035
Would it be wrong of me

21:03.060 --> 21:05.323
to assume there are traitors
in my midst?

21:05.957 --> 21:07.091
So...

21:07.629 --> 21:10.921
- What?
- Now we’ve moved from "blameless Klaus"

21:10.965 --> 21:12.445
to "paranoid Klaus."

21:13.340 --> 21:14.776
Well, if that zealot claims

21:14.801 --> 21:17.058
to have friends,
I’ll choose to believe her.

21:18.106 --> 21:19.906
It’s been two days since
you pledged your allegiance,

21:19.930 --> 21:22.193
and your first response
to Greta’s demands

21:22.237 --> 21:23.325
was to question me.

21:23.369 --> 21:25.660
It was to find a way out.

21:26.582 --> 21:28.001
It’s gonna take hours
to get her clean.

21:28.025 --> 21:31.202
And in the meantime,
Hayley sits some damn place.

21:31.840 --> 21:33.746
I’m just looking for a way
to get them to give her back.

21:33.770 --> 21:35.424
I’ll tell you
how they’ll give her back:

21:35.468 --> 21:37.513
breathless, in a wooden box.

21:40.712 --> 21:42.928
These people respond
to strength,

21:42.953 --> 21:44.390
not capitulation.

21:45.222 --> 21:47.181
Do you both understand
that reality?

21:49.163 --> 21:53.160
Can I count on you not to blink
in the face of their hatred?

21:54.570 --> 21:56.311
Always.

22:01.215 --> 22:02.364
You see that? You see,

22:02.408 --> 22:03.820
that is the problem
with our relationship.

22:03.844 --> 22:05.541
I think I’ve signed up
to be his partner,

22:05.585 --> 22:09.415
he thinks that I’ve pledged
allegiance to the king.

22:09.692 --> 22:11.738
[clears throat]
Yeah, well, uh...

22:11.804 --> 22:13.968
Not to risk my
skull again, but...

22:14.132 --> 22:15.421
you probably should've told him

22:15.464 --> 22:17.553
you called Freya
with Greta’s demands.

22:18.405 --> 22:19.555
There’s nothing to say

22:19.599 --> 22:21.383
until Freya calls back
and tells me

22:21.427 --> 22:23.679
if Hope intends to bind herself.

22:25.436 --> 22:26.519
FREYA:
It’ll be painful.

22:26.562 --> 22:28.434
- I don’t care.
- You could die.

22:28.477 --> 22:29.764
Same answer.

22:29.991 --> 22:31.271
We’re talking about snuffing out

22:31.306 --> 22:32.457
a fundamental part
of who you are...

22:32.481 --> 22:34.614
Which, as according to you,

22:34.657 --> 22:36.529
my mom never wanted me
to trigger anyway.

22:36.572 --> 22:38.444
But which she wanted
to be your decision.

22:38.487 --> 22:39.619
And I’m making it.

22:39.662 --> 22:40.750
Not like this, Hope.

22:40.794 --> 22:42.643
Listen. I know

22:43.002 --> 22:45.047
what it’s like to have
something taken from you

22:45.146 --> 22:46.974
against your will. Okay?

22:47.017 --> 22:49.237
For me, it was time.

22:49.800 --> 22:51.457
Years and years, cursed to sleep

22:51.500 --> 22:53.807
by Aunt Dahlia,
while the world spun around me.

22:53.850 --> 22:55.591
And I am telling you:
when you realize

22:55.635 --> 22:57.332
everything you’ve missed,

22:58.282 --> 23:00.327
it devastates.

23:02.673 --> 23:06.565
You know, if it were just to
save my mom, I’d want to do it.

23:07.473 --> 23:08.822
Or it could be the fact that...

23:08.865 --> 23:12.173
I’m partially responsible
for her being taken.

23:12.511 --> 23:13.522
Or that I’m not even sure

23:13.566 --> 23:15.737
I even want this freakish side
of myself.

23:15.763 --> 23:17.591
But it’s all those things.

23:19.432 --> 23:21.017
So, please, Aunt Freya,

23:21.042 --> 23:23.370
get whatever supplies
that you need,

23:23.395 --> 23:26.267
because you and I
are doing this.

23:40.723 --> 23:43.900
ROMAN: The whole
"note goes poof in my pocket"?

23:43.944 --> 23:45.815
It’s really kind
of an invasion, you know.

23:45.859 --> 23:47.600
Kind of hypocritical,
coming from the guy

23:47.643 --> 23:50.254
who keeps breaking into my room.

23:50.298 --> 23:51.473
[laughs softly]

23:51.517 --> 23:52.517
Fair.

23:52.996 --> 23:55.621
Um, so...

23:56.536 --> 23:58.402
I need a favor.

23:58.741 --> 24:01.048
There’s this thing

24:01.091 --> 24:02.615
that I have to do, and...

24:02.658 --> 24:05.356
there’s a chance
it might not end well.

24:06.142 --> 24:07.442
A "thing..."

24:08.277 --> 24:10.605
...that "might not end well"?

24:11.387 --> 24:12.644
Does this thing have
anything to do

24:12.668 --> 24:14.104
with what you and
your aunt are...

24:14.148 --> 24:17.673
♪ She always takes it black

24:17.717 --> 24:19.109
♪ But you’ll love her... ♪

24:19.153 --> 24:21.416
Okay. Didn’t really expect that.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.723
♪ Goes dark

24:23.766 --> 24:26.552
♪ You’ll love her

24:38.700 --> 24:39.719
Um...

24:41.305 --> 24:43.180
I might die today.

24:45.658 --> 24:46.658
Okay.

24:47.660 --> 24:50.414
It’s how I get my mom back,
so I just...

24:50.837 --> 24:54.667
needed to cross a few things
off my bucket list first.

24:55.842 --> 24:57.068
Wait, was that
just your first...?

24:57.092 --> 24:58.761
Can we not talk about it?

25:00.455 --> 25:02.718
[chuckles]

25:08.234 --> 25:10.465
You should've stuck your
hand down his throat

25:10.509 --> 25:11.616
and ripped out his entrails.

25:11.640 --> 25:13.033
Instead, you let him
off the hook.

25:13.076 --> 25:14.904
To prevent you
from exposing yourself.

25:14.948 --> 25:16.558
Might I spend the
balance of time cowed

25:16.602 --> 25:17.777
and ashamed of what I am?

25:17.820 --> 25:20.083
Not cowed and ashamed,
discreet and safe.

25:20.127 --> 25:22.695
The moment you reveal yourself,
you unleash an angry horde.

25:22.738 --> 25:24.414
None of whom can kill me.

25:24.439 --> 25:25.657
Father can.

25:25.682 --> 25:27.118
And given the chance, he will.

25:27.472 --> 25:30.605
So why empower him
with an army to hunt you down?

25:30.630 --> 25:34.373

this army really is.

25:39.015 --> 25:40.930
[flies buzzing]

25:45.108 --> 25:46.980
This was August and his people.

25:47.023 --> 25:48.410
They did this.

25:48.744 --> 25:51.530
They tore these poor wretches
from their beds.

25:51.652 --> 25:54.261
And they killed them
in their place of worship.

25:54.286 --> 25:56.158
It’s not your battle, Niklaus.

25:57.773 --> 25:58.597
Isn’t it?

25:58.644 --> 26:00.080
Not this time, no.

26:00.123 --> 26:01.777
You’re not
the savior of the wolves,

26:01.821 --> 26:03.866
and you cannot change
what happened here.

26:06.481 --> 26:08.396
Klaus, please.

26:10.684 --> 26:13.644
Those of us that matter
accept you for what you are.

26:13.789 --> 26:15.922
Your acceptance rings
a tad hollow

26:15.965 --> 26:18.620
considering you stood witness
as Mother bound the part of me

26:18.664 --> 26:20.013
these people want to kill.

26:20.056 --> 26:22.319
No, I did everything
that I could to protect you.

26:22.363 --> 26:24.191
Protect me?
[laughs]

26:24.234 --> 26:26.323
You were ashamed of me.

26:26.367 --> 26:28.587
You stood and you watched
as Mikael beat me

26:28.630 --> 26:29.631
till I passed out cold.

26:29.675 --> 26:31.851
I never watched you suffer!

26:33.069 --> 26:34.636
I was beside you,

26:34.680 --> 26:37.508
tortured and beaten
without mercy.

26:39.206 --> 26:41.338
Now, you tell me

26:41.382 --> 26:42.688
what you want from me.

26:42.731 --> 26:45.560
I need you to do something!

26:46.014 --> 26:47.320
To take action

26:47.345 --> 26:49.217
when people
call my kind "mongrels."

26:49.242 --> 26:50.591
Not just to talk.

26:51.108 --> 26:52.718
Otherwise, you’re
no better than those

26:52.743 --> 26:54.591
who turned their backs
and allowed this to happen.

26:54.615 --> 26:56.356
I have a good mind
to stick a dagger in you,

26:56.381 --> 26:59.080
put you in a coffin and stack
you atop our dear sister.

27:04.051 --> 27:06.973
Niklaus, you never cease
to amaze me.

27:09.542 --> 27:11.457
So, Rebekah's letters?

27:11.482 --> 27:13.118
"Dearest Elijah,

27:13.795 --> 27:17.059

is ever so inspiring."

27:17.290 --> 27:19.423
Oh, Niklaus.

27:19.498 --> 27:21.500
Another talent revealed.

27:23.867 --> 27:27.231
So how did you manage to deny
Rebekah's happiness this time?

27:27.256 --> 27:30.041
Did you eviscerate this Stefan
fellow like you did Alexander?

27:30.066 --> 27:31.653
Or did you simply toss him
from a balcony

27:31.677 --> 27:33.026
like the unfortunate Emil?

27:34.317 --> 27:36.106
I didn’t have a chance.

27:36.497 --> 27:39.718
But eternity is long,
and I have an excellent memory.

27:39.743 --> 27:41.223
Why do any of us bother?

27:41.248 --> 27:43.554
Well, from here on out, don’t.

27:45.576 --> 27:46.926
'Cause I'm sick and tired

27:46.969 --> 27:49.145

who claim to love me.

27:49.189 --> 27:51.060
So go back to where
you came from.

27:51.104 --> 27:53.715
And next time
you have word that Mikael

27:53.759 --> 27:55.630
is on my trail,
do us all a favor:

27:55.712 --> 27:57.382
let him come.

an easier way to do this.

Just don’t.

me to stop... No.

He didn’t have to.
A thousand years of family
