00:14.280 --> 00:15.600
See you later.

00:15.680 --> 00:16.720
Where are you going?

00:16.800 --> 00:19.560
Just out with some friends.

00:19.640 --> 00:21.800
- Not too late. Okay?
- Okay.

00:51.800 --> 00:53.320
- I need to talk with you.
- Helen!

00:53.400 --> 00:55.680
- Where is it?
- What are you talking about? Get off.

00:55.760 --> 00:57.800
The tape! I know you've got it.

00:58.400 --> 01:01.000
I don't know what you're talking about.
Let go of me.

01:04.160 --> 01:05.319
I need it back.

01:56.240 --> 01:59.640
Forty-six-year-old male
with no comorbidities.

02:00.200 --> 02:04.600
Two puncture wounds in the abdomen,
received approximately 25 minutes ago.

02:05.680 --> 02:08.280
Let's prep
for an emergency laparotomy

02:08.360 --> 02:09.919
and get him into theater.

02:11.600 --> 02:13.280
Thank you.

02:13.360 --> 02:14.480
I will.

02:17.560 --> 02:20.440
No, thank you. I will. Thank you. Bye.

02:27.160 --> 02:29.880
That was the lady
from the house on the corner.

02:32.280 --> 02:33.640
She made some food.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.600
Maybe we should eat something.

02:51.680 --> 02:53.200
I'm not hungry.

02:55.440 --> 02:59.080
Just come and sit down at the table,
and see if you can manage something.

03:04.440 --> 03:05.720
Mum?

03:05.800 --> 03:07.480
Zoe, please.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.400
How is he? Are you all right?

03:53.480 --> 03:54.800
He's stable, but...

03:54.880 --> 03:56.400
he's lost a lot of blood.

03:56.480 --> 03:59.240
We'll have to wait to see
if there's any lasting damage.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.720
How the hell did this happen?

04:03.720 --> 04:05.480
I was trying to find Jenny.

04:07.320 --> 04:08.880
Can I have a quick word?

04:18.360 --> 04:20.560
Tom, seriously...

04:20.640 --> 04:24.160
you've got to leave the investigation
to us before you get someone killed.

04:25.040 --> 04:28.480
What's gonna happen to Carrie
if you end up in intensive care or worse?

04:30.200 --> 04:31.480
Just ease up.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.920
Stop running at things head-on.

04:36.040 --> 04:39.120
Look, we are doing
everything we can to find her.

04:40.480 --> 04:41.760
It's not enough.

05:18.800 --> 05:20.080
What's going on?

05:20.160 --> 05:22.920
He's fine.
I thought I saw him struggling to breathe,

05:23.000 --> 05:24.880
but I think it might just be
fluid on his lung.

05:24.960 --> 05:25.920
I'll leave you to it.

05:26.000 --> 05:26.920
I'll see you in the morning.

05:27.480 --> 05:29.000
Yeah, okay. Thanks.

05:29.080 --> 05:30.120
See you tomorrow.

05:35.280 --> 05:37.480
- Tom?
- Who is she?

05:37.560 --> 05:40.040
Emma? Emma Castle. Why?

05:40.760 --> 05:43.200
Why does it feel like I know her somehow?

05:44.640 --> 05:46.960
Darren. Yeah, hold on a sec.

05:47.040 --> 05:49.600
Uh, I'm sorry. I've got to take this.
I'll meet you at the car.

06:47.200 --> 06:48.360
I was looking for Sophie.

06:48.440 --> 06:50.360
She's taking a call downstairs.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.360
Corrina Castle.

06:54.280 --> 06:56.080
Is she related to you?

07:01.360 --> 07:03.120
- She was my mum.
- "Was"?

07:03.200 --> 07:06.320
- Corrina's...
- Four years ago. Cancer.

07:06.400 --> 07:07.840
I'm sorry to hear that.

07:08.400 --> 07:11.560
The three of us were great friends
in med school.

07:11.680 --> 07:12.600
Until...

07:14.840 --> 07:16.120
she left one day...

07:16.680 --> 07:18.560
without warning or explanation.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.680
It's not a coincidence that you're here.

07:22.760 --> 07:26.040
Is it? In this town, in this room.

07:27.120 --> 07:30.360
What are you doing here?
What are you looking for?

07:34.440 --> 07:37.400
It's Pete... isn't it?

07:37.960 --> 07:38.960
He's...

07:41.400 --> 07:42.480
my dad.

07:47.280 --> 07:50.240
I know she stayed in touch
with Pete for some time.

07:50.960 --> 07:52.600
She never told you about him?

07:53.360 --> 07:55.320
I started finding things out
after the funeral,

07:55.400 --> 07:56.480
from my auntie.

07:57.240 --> 08:01.400
I moved here with the intention of
just watching him from a distance,

08:02.720 --> 08:06.120
figuring out a plan,
waiting for the right time, but...

08:08.640 --> 08:10.640
he became a suspect
in Jenny's disappearance

08:10.720 --> 08:13.520
within hours of me joining the department.

08:14.640 --> 08:17.760
It might be too late now.
I might have lost my chance.

08:18.880 --> 08:23.800
Look, he's bruised and damaged right now,

08:23.880 --> 08:25.120
but he'll make it.

08:25.200 --> 08:28.240
There simply is no other option, okay?

08:28.800 --> 08:30.680
And you're gonna find the right time,

08:31.240 --> 08:34.120
and you're gonna tell him
everything you've ever wanted to.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.320
That is gonna blow his mind.

08:38.240 --> 08:40.799
But once he's got his head 'round it all,

08:41.360 --> 08:44.320
you're gonna find you got yourself
a Pete Mayfield for life.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.760
They're a loyal breed.

08:51.880 --> 08:52.760
It's Sophie.

08:52.840 --> 08:54.600
If she finds out I used the databases...

08:54.680 --> 08:58.120
I won't tell anyone anything.
You're entitled to your secrets.

09:13.680 --> 09:15.480
Who were those guys?

09:15.560 --> 09:16.600
Who stabbed Pete?

09:16.680 --> 09:18.360
I don't know. I swear.
I came to see how he was.

09:18.440 --> 09:21.040
Who were they?
You live around there.

09:21.120 --> 09:23.040
- You know them.
- Really, I don't.

09:23.120 --> 09:24.360
Yeah, I live 'round there,

09:24.440 --> 09:26.840
but I keep my head down,
just like Rachel told me.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.200
I... I found this.

09:31.280 --> 09:32.960
Look, that's him, right?

09:33.640 --> 09:35.360
- Yeah.
- A few cards are still in it.

09:35.440 --> 09:37.720
- There wasn't any cash when I found it.
- Okay.

09:42.560 --> 09:45.120
You saw Jenny the night
of the party, right?

09:45.600 --> 09:47.440
You spoke to her, right?

09:48.720 --> 09:50.240
What did you talk about?

09:51.880 --> 09:52.840
I, um...

09:54.400 --> 09:55.840
She wouldn't want me to say.

09:56.760 --> 09:59.720
You think by not telling me,
you're protecting her?

09:59.800 --> 10:02.200
She didn't even tell me what it was.

10:02.280 --> 10:05.080
Just that she'd found something out.

10:05.160 --> 10:06.000
What "something"?

10:07.200 --> 10:10.120
Something... Something to do with Rachel.

10:11.360 --> 10:14.800
A secret she told Jenny
the night she died.

10:16.840 --> 10:17.800
What kind of secret?

10:17.880 --> 10:19.240
I don't know, man.

10:20.520 --> 10:22.120
But it sounded serious.

10:22.680 --> 10:25.200
She said you can never find out.

10:26.280 --> 10:27.640
That's all I know.

10:30.200 --> 10:33.520
Look, man,
I really hope you find her, yeah?

10:38.920 --> 10:40.160
What are you talking about?

10:40.720 --> 10:41.760
A secret.

10:41.840 --> 10:44.920
Something Rachel told Jenny
on her deathbed

10:45.000 --> 10:46.120
set all of this in motion:

10:46.200 --> 10:50.120
Chris' death, Jenny going missing,
Pete getting stabbed, all of it.

10:50.200 --> 10:51.400
What kind of secret?

10:51.480 --> 10:52.560
I don't know.

10:54.400 --> 10:57.080
I should have been there, Sophie.
I should have been there.

11:03.160 --> 11:04.760
Where the fuck have you been?

11:05.320 --> 11:06.160
Sophie.

11:07.320 --> 11:08.840
Hey!

11:08.920 --> 11:11.560
- How you doing? Everything all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

11:12.640 --> 11:13.640
Hey, how's Rach?

11:14.240 --> 11:15.440
Not good.

11:17.040 --> 11:18.280
And how are you?

11:21.200 --> 11:22.120
Come on.

11:24.440 --> 11:27.200
The girls... They're astonishing.

11:27.760 --> 11:30.200
Handling things much better than I am.

11:31.040 --> 11:32.520
All right, enough of the vandalism.

11:33.080 --> 11:35.040
Learn how to knit instead.

11:35.120 --> 11:37.080
I know how to knit, thank you.

11:37.160 --> 11:38.720
Shut up.

11:38.800 --> 11:40.840
- No, you don't.
- Seriously.

11:40.920 --> 11:43.760
I learned when I was doing my residency.

11:43.840 --> 11:48.000
I had to improve my manual dexterity,
or I wouldn't make it in surgery.

11:48.080 --> 11:51.080
So... you want the golden hands,
you learn to knit.

11:51.160 --> 11:53.560
Wait a second. What?

11:53.640 --> 11:55.400
"The golden hands"?

11:55.960 --> 11:58.600
The golden hands. Shield your eyes.

11:58.680 --> 12:00.640
Mmm...

12:03.360 --> 12:04.600
Do you need to go?

12:05.440 --> 12:07.120
No, I'm having fun.

12:07.200 --> 12:09.640
Hey, excuse me? Is that tequila up there?

12:09.720 --> 12:10.640
It is, yeah.

12:13.480 --> 12:14.960
- Mmm.
- Wow.

12:15.600 --> 12:16.520
And again.

12:17.320 --> 12:20.040
- Could you pour another one for my friend?
- No.

12:20.120 --> 12:21.160
Cheers.

12:23.920 --> 12:26.200
Wow, Doctor, whatever happened
to your golden hands?

12:26.280 --> 12:28.480
I usually play better the drunker I get.

12:34.440 --> 12:36.200
Move out the way.
I'm trying to do my shot.

12:36.280 --> 12:39.000
Don't mind me.

12:39.080 --> 12:40.320
Seriously, Tom.

12:40.400 --> 12:41.920
Just going down the stairs.

12:42.000 --> 12:42.880
You're putting me off.

12:42.960 --> 12:44.360
Oh, my God!

12:44.440 --> 12:46.680
- You're so good at this.
- Yeah, really good.

12:47.240 --> 12:48.360
I'm sorry. Sorry.

13:03.920 --> 13:06.800
- Um, sorry, this isn't...
- No, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have.

13:06.880 --> 13:08.200
You shouldn't worry...

13:08.280 --> 13:11.480
No, it's me. It's me. It's me. I'm sorry.

13:11.560 --> 13:13.800
I'm sorry, okay?

13:24.120 --> 13:25.120
Shit!

13:39.560 --> 13:41.280
Where the fuck have you been?

14:03.080 --> 14:04.240
- All right?
- Hey.

14:04.320 --> 14:06.240
They're in bed,
but they definitely aren't asleep.

14:06.320 --> 14:09.240
Do 12-year-old girls
actually ever stop talking?

14:09.320 --> 14:10.840
- No.
- Okay.

14:10.920 --> 14:13.280
- You coming in? Want a beer?
- No, thanks.

14:14.040 --> 14:16.200
- Sorry to be so late.
- That's all right.

14:16.280 --> 14:18.280
- She got a free babysitter, this one.
- Yeah, well,

14:18.360 --> 14:20.000
babysitters don't usually
swan around the house

14:20.080 --> 14:21.720
with a beer in their hand,
so...

14:22.720 --> 14:25.280
She doesn't know the babysitters I know.

14:25.360 --> 14:26.440
Any news?

14:27.960 --> 14:28.880
I'm afraid not.

14:29.440 --> 14:30.880
We'll hear something soon.

14:32.640 --> 14:34.000
- Speak tomorrow?
- Yeah.

14:35.320 --> 14:37.280
Is Uncle Pete gonna be all right?

14:38.280 --> 14:39.120
Yes.

14:41.240 --> 14:43.280
It feels like when Mum died.

14:43.840 --> 14:45.320
Hey. It's not like that.

14:45.400 --> 14:46.400
He's...

14:48.080 --> 14:49.240
He'll be okay.

14:54.320 --> 14:55.360
Carrie...

14:56.360 --> 15:00.360
did Jenny ever mention anything
about that night when Mum died?

15:01.480 --> 15:02.720
Like what?

15:04.120 --> 15:06.400
She ever mention a secret?

15:06.480 --> 15:08.840
Something Mum might have told her?

15:08.920 --> 15:11.240
- A secret?
- Yeah.

15:12.400 --> 15:16.640
Mum didn't tell me anything.
I don't know if she did Jenny.

15:19.560 --> 15:22.120
Helen came to see her that night.

15:22.680 --> 15:23.880
What?

15:23.960 --> 15:25.200
Helen Crowthorne?

15:25.760 --> 15:26.600
Yeah.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.040
The night Mum died?

15:29.120 --> 15:30.640
What was she doing in our house?

15:30.720 --> 15:32.280
She was in Mum's room,

15:32.360 --> 15:34.400
talking to her when I went in.

15:35.600 --> 15:37.920
I couldn't understand how she got
in there, but...

15:38.000 --> 15:41.440
Mum said it was okay and not to worry.

15:45.600 --> 15:46.920
I owe you an apology.

15:47.520 --> 15:50.000
- Yeah?
- Yeah, your story checks out.

15:50.560 --> 15:52.960
- You were helping that girl.
- That's what I told you.

15:54.160 --> 15:56.080
Wait, why? What did... What did you do?

15:56.160 --> 15:58.080
Well, I sent Darren down there
to speak to her,

15:58.160 --> 16:01.800
and explain that you were being
investigated as part of a murder inquiry.

16:01.880 --> 16:03.440
Are you fucking serious? You can't...

16:03.520 --> 16:05.080
Oh!

16:09.280 --> 16:11.480
- What?
- Tom.

16:11.960 --> 16:13.040
I'm not daft.

16:13.120 --> 16:15.120
- Aren't you?
- I'm just saying.

16:15.680 --> 16:16.880
I'm cool with it.

16:16.960 --> 16:19.560
Okay, I don't know what the "it"
you are referring to is,

16:19.640 --> 16:21.040
but I can promise you one thing.

16:22.600 --> 16:24.360
You're definitely not cool.

18:29.120 --> 18:29.960
Helen?

18:47.240 --> 18:49.080
Oi, Pavarotti!

18:49.160 --> 18:52.280
Knock it on the head.
Let the rest of us get some peace.

18:52.360 --> 18:55.120
You know what?
You're absolutely right, pal.

18:55.840 --> 18:58.040
He's a genius, this one.

18:58.120 --> 18:59.600
What's your name, neighbor?

19:01.080 --> 19:02.080
Alan.

19:02.880 --> 19:03.960
Alan?

19:04.440 --> 19:05.920
My name's Alan, Alan.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.400
You are a genius.

19:08.480 --> 19:09.920
Can I buy a cig off you, Alan?

19:10.000 --> 19:11.080
I've got money.

19:12.200 --> 19:13.560
Where's me pants?

19:13.640 --> 19:15.880
I've got all me Bitcoins in that...

19:15.960 --> 19:17.440
Who's nicked me pants?

19:17.520 --> 19:19.240
Give 'em back.

19:19.320 --> 19:20.720
Hold up.

19:20.800 --> 19:23.360
Did you have pants on
when they picked you up?

19:23.440 --> 19:25.600
Maybe that's why they picked you up.

19:25.680 --> 19:27.640
That's right, Alan! You're right!

19:27.720 --> 19:29.520
I said you were a genius, didn't I?

19:29.600 --> 19:31.520
What've they got you in for, Alan?

19:31.600 --> 19:34.000
I stole an ice cream van.

19:34.080 --> 19:35.360
Alan...

19:35.440 --> 19:38.040
I really didn't expect that of you.

19:38.120 --> 19:40.440
Still, could be worse.

19:40.520 --> 19:42.600
They had a bastard in earlier
who killed a kid.

19:43.200 --> 19:45.600
- What?
- Drowned him in his swimming pool.

19:46.120 --> 19:47.840
Where'd you hear that?

19:47.920 --> 19:49.080
Word gets around.

19:49.160 --> 19:50.640
The boy wouldn't give him what he wanted,

19:50.720 --> 19:52.240
- if you get me meaning.
- What?

19:52.800 --> 19:54.400
No, it wasn't anything like that!

19:54.480 --> 19:56.600
I heard it was just an accident.

19:56.680 --> 20:00.160
It wasn't a kid.
He was a teenager.

20:00.720 --> 20:03.720
- He was more of an adult.
- Listen, this guy's loaded.

20:03.800 --> 20:05.520
Big house, swimming pool...

20:05.600 --> 20:07.240
But it's never enough, is it?

20:07.320 --> 20:09.880
this young lad.

20:09.960 --> 20:12.360
And when he's told no, he loses it,

20:12.440 --> 20:14.800
drowns the poor lad, so he doesn't tell.

20:15.600 --> 20:19.600
Don't you worry, Alan.
He'll get his inside.

20:19.680 --> 20:23.120
Them types...
They never last long in jail, do they?

20:23.680 --> 20:25.000
Once word gets out...

20:26.600 --> 20:28.480
And word always gets out.

20:43.560 --> 20:48.520
I will never understand
how a man gets to 44 years old,

20:48.600 --> 20:51.240
doesn't know how to tie a tie.

20:52.880 --> 20:54.600
I just like you doing it.

20:59.720 --> 21:00.720
VoilÃ .

21:11.160 --> 21:12.200
Tilly?

21:42.040 --> 21:43.520
How are they treating you, Mr. Marshall?

21:43.600 --> 21:45.960
Right then,
Mr. "Two Hundred Quid An Hour,"

21:46.520 --> 21:49.320
we're about to find out
just how good you really are.

21:53.600 --> 21:58.720
"I, John Joseph Marshall,
born 18th December, 1971,

21:58.800 --> 22:04.080
of 12 Dockton Lane, Chelton,
make this statement freely,

22:04.640 --> 22:08.280
admitting my sole responsibility
for the death of Christopher Chahal

22:08.360 --> 22:12.760
at my home, in the early hours
of September the 3rd.

22:12.840 --> 22:16.240
Around 11:00 p.m. on the night
of the 2nd of September,

22:16.320 --> 22:19.720
while spending the night away
at Callow Hall Hotel,

22:20.400 --> 22:22.520
a celebration of our wedding anniversary,

22:23.640 --> 22:26.880
my wife and I received a telephone call
from our daughter,

22:26.960 --> 22:31.080
concerning a party
that had spiraled out of control.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.280
We returned home."

22:33.360 --> 22:34.200
Okay.

22:34.280 --> 22:35.720
"Leaving my wife in the car,

22:36.280 --> 22:40.840
I arrived through the garden gate,
where I encountered Christopher,

22:40.920 --> 22:43.480
who appeared to be intoxicated

22:43.560 --> 22:45.560
and was acting in a belligerent manner.

22:46.560 --> 22:48.320
When I asked him to leave,

22:48.400 --> 22:51.120
Christopher became aggressive towards me.

22:51.200 --> 22:53.280
A physical altercation ensued,

22:53.360 --> 22:56.120
culminating in
Christopher losing his balance

22:56.200 --> 22:58.760
and falling into the swimming pool.

23:00.720 --> 23:02.920
By the time I managed
to pull him from the water,

23:03.000 --> 23:06.600
Christopher was, regrettably,
limp and unresponsive.

23:07.560 --> 23:09.640
I attempted to resuscitate him,

23:10.200 --> 23:11.400
to no avail.

23:11.960 --> 23:16.200
In a complete state of shock,
I moved Christopher's body to the garage

23:16.280 --> 23:20.320
to spare my wife and daughter the trauma
of what I had just witnessed.

23:20.920 --> 23:22.600
In the subsequent days,

23:22.680 --> 23:26.720
I experienced what I believe
to be post-traumatic stress disorder.

23:26.800 --> 23:29.160
Anxious and unable to sleep,

23:29.640 --> 23:30.480
I...

23:32.760 --> 23:36.040
I disposed of Christopher's body
at Whitdon Reservoir.

23:37.840 --> 23:41.640
My wife and daughter remain, to this day,

23:42.120 --> 23:44.120
unaware of my actions.

23:45.640 --> 23:47.000
I acted alone.

23:48.240 --> 23:51.800
I wholeheartedly regret my reckless
and appalling decisions."

23:57.840 --> 23:59.920
So, what are his bloods saying?

24:03.320 --> 24:06.560
Okay. Thanks for the update.
I'll speak to you later.

24:07.360 --> 24:08.680
Was that about Uncle Pete?

24:10.800 --> 24:11.640
Yeah.

24:12.200 --> 24:13.560
How's he doing?

24:13.640 --> 24:15.200
He's... as expected.

24:15.960 --> 24:17.680
Is "as expected" good?

24:18.760 --> 24:19.720
Yeah.

24:22.600 --> 24:23.960
You need to get ready.

24:27.240 --> 24:30.080
Carrie, if you're gonna come to the vigil,
you need to get ready.

24:30.160 --> 24:32.120
- Now.
- Okay.

25:14.760 --> 25:16.520
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

25:19.360 --> 25:21.200
She'll be down in a sec.
Can we get you a drink?

25:21.280 --> 25:22.320
- No, thank you.
- No.

25:25.960 --> 25:27.320
You're early, aren't you?

25:27.960 --> 25:29.960
Yes, we needed to come
and talk to you both

25:30.040 --> 25:32.440
about a development in the investigation.

25:32.520 --> 25:34.800
Would you mind taking a seat, please?

25:40.880 --> 25:42.680
So, we have someone in custody

25:42.760 --> 25:45.680
who claims to be responsible
for Chris' death.

25:46.280 --> 25:48.560
They've confessed,
claiming it was an accidental death,

25:48.640 --> 25:50.560
but we would urge caution.

25:50.640 --> 25:52.840
We've yet to corroborate
their version of events.

25:52.920 --> 25:54.800
Who? Who's confessed?

26:31.520 --> 26:32.520
Uh, not that.

26:32.600 --> 26:35.600
I don't give a shit.
It's mine. I'm taking it.

26:35.680 --> 26:37.560
This is a hard drive.

26:37.640 --> 26:40.640
It's hardly a murder weapon,
is it, you jobs-worth tool?

26:40.720 --> 26:41.880
I'm a singer. Do you understand?

26:41.960 --> 26:45.160
So, obviously, I need this for my music.
You can't keep it from me!

26:45.240 --> 26:47.320
Will you, for once in your life,

26:47.400 --> 26:49.480
stop thinking only of yourself?

26:49.960 --> 26:53.040
Your father is in a bloody prison cell
because of you!

26:56.360 --> 26:59.080
Mum... I'm sorry.

26:59.160 --> 27:01.160
I... I'm sorry.

27:04.680 --> 27:06.120
Did you do it?

27:08.240 --> 27:11.840
Did you, or someone you know,
kill that boy?

27:13.960 --> 27:15.040
No.

27:16.200 --> 27:19.240
No, Mum, I swear to you.
I don't know anything about it.

28:02.080 --> 28:03.960
"Thank you, everyone, for coming.

28:04.960 --> 28:07.880
Zoe, Tilly, and I have been deeply moved

28:07.960 --> 28:10.080
by the affection
that you have shown Chris..."

28:19.120 --> 28:20.200
"Our...

28:23.040 --> 28:24.200
hearts..."

28:29.920 --> 28:31.680
"Our hearts are broken,

28:32.160 --> 28:35.240
but it is a comfort to know
we are not alone in our grief.

28:36.400 --> 28:40.680
Tilly thoughtfully asked
if she could put together this gathering,

28:40.760 --> 28:43.480
and we thought it a fitting gesture.

28:44.440 --> 28:47.040
We're going to release
some balloons shortly,

28:47.600 --> 28:51.520
and welcome everyone to fill out a card
with a message for Christopher."

28:52.720 --> 28:54.760
To have a child taken from you

28:55.760 --> 28:58.600
is truly cruel and awful.

28:58.680 --> 29:00.880
Perhaps we should all take a minute...

29:02.280 --> 29:04.840
to silently hold Christopher
in our thoughts.

29:26.480 --> 29:28.640
I don't believe Jojo Marshall's story.

29:30.280 --> 29:31.280
No.

29:32.720 --> 29:35.080
And if I'm right,
then that means that Chris' killer...

29:35.160 --> 29:36.320
Could well be here.

29:56.880 --> 29:58.160
I need a moment.

29:59.080 --> 29:59.920
Zoe?

30:00.000 --> 30:03.600
I just need a moment
where no one is looking at me.

30:11.520 --> 30:12.360
Hey.

30:12.920 --> 30:14.200
Henry?

30:14.280 --> 30:15.240
Hi.

30:15.320 --> 30:16.760
Can you talk a minute?

30:16.840 --> 30:18.640
Uh, yeah, I suppose. What's up?

30:18.720 --> 30:21.880
I just wanted to ask you
about Sia's party.

30:21.960 --> 30:24.280
- You were there, right?
- Yeah.

30:24.360 --> 30:25.960
And you saw Jenny there?

30:26.520 --> 30:27.440
Yeah.

30:27.520 --> 30:29.160
That was the night
she went missing, you know.

30:29.720 --> 30:30.880
You talked to her?

30:31.480 --> 30:32.640
Uh... A bit.

30:33.200 --> 30:34.720
Did she ask about the blood?

30:36.040 --> 30:37.200
Blood?

30:37.280 --> 30:38.680
On your sweater.

30:40.680 --> 30:42.080
Um...

30:43.000 --> 30:44.640
Hey, don't walk away from me.

30:44.720 --> 30:46.640
I'm talking to you.

30:46.720 --> 30:47.560
Let me go.

30:48.360 --> 30:49.320
Back in a minute.

30:50.840 --> 30:52.840
There is a picture of you,
the night of the party,

30:52.920 --> 30:54.760
with blood on your sweater.

30:54.840 --> 30:56.240
That's odd, right?

30:56.320 --> 30:58.440
The night a person gets killed,
another goes missing.

30:58.520 --> 30:59.360
Wouldn't you say?

30:59.440 --> 31:02.240
You're stretching my hoodie, Tom.
I don't know anything.

31:02.320 --> 31:03.480
Do you remember now?

31:03.560 --> 31:05.320
What the hell is going on?

31:05.400 --> 31:08.040
It's your son, covered in blood,
at Sia Marshall's party,

31:08.640 --> 31:10.920
the night Jenny went missing
and Chris died.

31:11.720 --> 31:13.520
I asked you about that jumper.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.320
Mike and Chris got into a fight
at the party.

31:18.800 --> 31:19.840
Hey! Hey!

31:21.360 --> 31:23.400
- Stop.
- What's wrong with you, man?

31:24.080 --> 31:25.080
I tried to stop it.

31:25.160 --> 31:26.240
I pulled them apart.

31:27.440 --> 31:28.760
Mike and Chris had a fight?

31:30.400 --> 31:32.960
Well, why didn't you mention this before?

31:34.040 --> 31:34.880
Henry!

31:35.320 --> 31:37.960
It is hard enough trying to fit in
and pretend I am normal

31:38.520 --> 31:42.000
without having my mum arrest
the popular kid because I snitched on him.

31:46.440 --> 31:48.400
Look, I'll talk to Mike about this.

31:48.480 --> 31:50.320
I'm sorry.
I don't know how we missed this.

31:50.880 --> 31:52.600
But, Tom, was it really necessary
to grab my child

31:52.680 --> 31:55.360
and pull him around at his friend's vigil
in front of everybody?

31:56.000 --> 31:56.840
Carrie!

32:01.120 --> 32:02.320
I should go.

32:03.840 --> 32:04.760
Sophie.

32:05.480 --> 32:06.920
It's Darren.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.480
Pathologists have ruled
on a time of death for Chris.

32:09.560 --> 32:12.280
It's between 10:30 and 11:00 p.m.

32:12.360 --> 32:16.920
Lauren and Jojo Marshall were seen
on CCTV leaving the hotel at 11:16.

32:17.680 --> 32:18.920
He couldn't have done it.

32:20.040 --> 32:22.560
Yeah, I'm coming back now. Bye.

32:54.160 --> 32:55.200
Hello?

32:56.680 --> 32:57.960
Is someone there?

33:09.520 --> 33:10.360
Hello?

33:15.480 --> 33:16.480
Hello?

33:42.560 --> 33:43.720
- Mama?
- Tilly.

33:43.800 --> 33:44.640
Everything okay?

33:44.720 --> 33:47.520
Everything's fine. We're going
back home. Weâ€™re going back home.

33:58.520 --> 34:00.920
I overreacted. I'm sorry.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.240
I'm a bit, um...

34:04.360 --> 34:05.760
I'll apologize to Henry.

34:06.880 --> 34:08.280
It wasn't you.

34:08.760 --> 34:12.480
Agnes suggested sending off a balloon
with a message to Jenny,

34:12.560 --> 34:16.880
saying, "Come back home. We love you."

34:16.960 --> 34:20.639
But Izzy said,
"Don't. She's a murdering cow."

34:22.400 --> 34:25.800
Sometimes in life,
mean people can say mean things.

34:26.679 --> 34:28.840
I'm not upset about what they said.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.199
I'm upset that they might be right.

34:33.920 --> 34:35.800
This is your sister we're talking about.

34:36.639 --> 34:39.560
We're family.
It's us three against the world.

34:39.639 --> 34:41.280
We know she didn't do it.

34:41.360 --> 34:42.440
Do we?

34:43.199 --> 34:44.520
Where is she, Dad?

34:51.520 --> 34:52.400
It's Ellen.

34:55.440 --> 34:56.639
Can I go 'round?

34:57.800 --> 34:59.320
Yeah, sure.

35:06.200 --> 35:11.160
You and Lauren were recorded leaving
the hotel on their CCTV at 11:16 p.m.

35:11.720 --> 35:12.640
Right?

35:14.520 --> 35:17.840
Our pathologist concluded
that Chris Chahal drowned

35:17.920 --> 35:20.760
between 10:30 and 11:00 p.m. that night.

35:22.320 --> 35:26.120
Which means you were 94 miles away
when he died, Jojo.

35:31.200 --> 35:32.440
No comment.

35:32.520 --> 35:34.640
Why would you confess if you didn't do it?

35:36.320 --> 35:37.160
No comment.

35:37.240 --> 35:38.680
Because you're her father.

35:39.240 --> 35:42.440
And a father would do
anything to protect his daughter.

35:43.440 --> 35:45.360
It's Sia, isn't it? You're protecting Sia.

35:45.440 --> 35:48.280
Chris persuaded her. She didn't want to.
He persuaded her.

35:48.360 --> 35:49.280
To do what?

35:49.840 --> 35:51.000
To sell him the drugs.

35:51.080 --> 35:53.080
She didn't know he'd go into the pool.

35:54.360 --> 35:56.640
Sia sold Chris drugs
the night of the party?

35:59.080 --> 36:00.160
And you think what?

36:00.240 --> 36:02.120
Chris drowned because of what he'd taken?

36:04.800 --> 36:06.760
Chris Chahal's death wasn't drugs-related.

36:08.080 --> 36:10.680
He was deliberately
and forcibly assaulted.

36:13.520 --> 36:15.160
Held under the water until he drowned.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.760
But Sia wouldn't...

36:26.840 --> 36:28.160
She couldn't.

36:28.240 --> 36:29.960
How about you start telling us the truth?

38:27.960 --> 38:28.800
Hello?

38:28.880 --> 38:31.800
Ben? It's Tom Delaney.
I've got an emergency here.

38:31.880 --> 38:34.120
Any chance this can wait
until next week, dude?

38:34.200 --> 38:35.640
I'm in Miami at a convention.

38:35.720 --> 38:38.320
No, it can't wait. I wouldn't call
if it wasn't an emergency.

38:38.400 --> 38:42.040
How do you find where a message came from?
Like, immediately.

38:42.120 --> 38:44.440
Well, what kind of message?

38:44.520 --> 38:47.040
Like a text, e-mail thing.

38:47.600 --> 38:48.960
Right, well, e-mail it to me.

38:49.040 --> 38:50.160
Okay.

38:57.840 --> 38:58.680
Sent.

39:05.000 --> 39:05.840
What the fuck?

39:05.920 --> 39:07.440
What's happening? You see something?

39:07.520 --> 39:08.800
Well, I got the IP address.

39:08.880 --> 39:11.400
Well... what is it?
How do we track it down?

39:11.480 --> 39:12.760
Yeah, I don't need to do that.

39:13.320 --> 39:14.320
Ben, I don't...

39:14.400 --> 39:17.800
There are 4.3 billion IP addresses
in the world.

39:18.360 --> 39:20.400
What are the odds
that I'd recognize this one?

39:20.480 --> 39:21.640
What are you talking about?

39:21.720 --> 39:24.080
That IP address. It's yours, dude.

39:24.160 --> 39:26.880
That message came from your home network.

39:28.520 --> 39:29.640
She's in the house.

39:45.560 --> 39:48.200
Are you sure about this?
There's no one in the house.

39:48.760 --> 39:50.440
I never said "in the house," dude.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.360
I said "home network."

39:54.120 --> 39:55.600
She's not here.

39:55.680 --> 39:57.800
As long as they're in range
and have the password,

39:57.880 --> 40:00.000
then they can access your signal.

40:00.080 --> 40:01.720
Check your phone.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.360
You see the little Wi-Fi triangle?

40:03.440 --> 40:05.360
That's how you'll know you're in range.

40:06.200 --> 40:07.400
Shit.

40:07.880 --> 40:09.440
Ben, I'll call you back.

40:19.720 --> 40:20.720
Watch out!

40:22.520 --> 40:23.640
Sorry.

41:02.680 --> 41:03.640
Jenny!

41:25.040 --> 41:26.080
Jenny!

41:26.640 --> 41:27.560
Jenny!
