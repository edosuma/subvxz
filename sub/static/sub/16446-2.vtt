00:00.684 --> 00:03.637
- Previously on Lucifer...
- Who escaped Hell?

00:03.777 --> 00:04.777
Mum.

00:04.811 --> 00:06.923
Dad got pissed off and
tossed me out of the house.

00:06.947 --> 00:08.180
And what did your mother do?

00:08.248 --> 00:09.759
She just stood there and let it happen.

00:09.783 --> 00:12.151
A couple of a thousand years later,
Dad kicked her out, too.

00:12.219 --> 00:15.955
So I did the same for her
as she did for me: zilch.

00:16.023 --> 00:18.824
So, Mama Morningstar's on the loose.

00:18.892 --> 00:20.159
I never could break that woman.

00:20.227 --> 00:21.453
She wouldn't submit.

00:21.454 --> 00:23.406
- What are you doing here?
- I've been demoted.

00:23.430 --> 00:25.364
Been reassigned to assist on cases.

00:25.432 --> 00:28.000
You lied to me about being a doctor.

00:28.068 --> 00:29.368
Do you realize

00:29.436 --> 00:31.537
the ethical position you've put me in?

00:34.241 --> 00:36.242
If she's not coming to kill me,

00:36.310 --> 00:37.944
then I don't know what she's doing.

00:38.011 --> 00:39.423
That's truly terrifying.

00:41.248 --> 00:42.281
Lucifer.

00:42.349 --> 00:43.349
Mum.

00:43.383 --> 00:45.251
Help me.

00:49.489 --> 00:50.767
Hello?

00:50.791 --> 00:52.168
- Are you okay?
- He just collapsed.

00:52.192 --> 00:54.527
- Does anyone know CPR?
- No, I don't know.

00:54.595 --> 00:55.995
Hello? Are you okay?

00:56.063 --> 00:57.463
Call 911!

00:57.531 --> 00:59.165
Uh, heart attack maybe?

00:59.232 --> 01:01.167
I think he might be dead.

01:04.236 --> 01:07.540
Sir? Sir?

01:07.608 --> 01:09.075
- Lucifer?
- Sir, are you okay?

01:09.142 --> 01:10.343
Lucifer? Where are you?

01:10.410 --> 01:11.844
Sir, are you okay?

01:11.912 --> 01:13.746
Has anyone seen Lucifer?

01:15.000 --> 01:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:35.636 --> 01:36.869
Lucifer.

01:36.937 --> 01:38.571
I need to find Lucifer.

01:38.639 --> 01:42.642
Man. Thought I killed your ass.

02:17.077 --> 02:19.211
Hey, Mom?

02:22.416 --> 02:23.849
Mommy...

03:05.559 --> 03:08.594
Lucifer.

03:08.662 --> 03:12.932
And that's when I started
looking for you, son.

03:12.999 --> 03:14.333
At least I've managed to keep

03:14.401 --> 03:16.836
this flesh sack in one piece.

03:16.903 --> 03:18.704
It has not been easy.

03:18.772 --> 03:22.241
Quite a few of the male species
have been eying me hungrily.

03:23.143 --> 03:24.944
Do humans eat their own?

03:25.011 --> 03:27.780
Well, say something.

03:27.848 --> 03:29.415
Aren't you glad to see me?

03:29.483 --> 03:31.517
I apologize for my human form, but...

03:31.585 --> 03:34.954
at least this one has supreme hindquarters.

03:36.623 --> 03:37.790
You're lying.

03:37.858 --> 03:39.558
No. They're quite sturdy. Feel it.

03:39.626 --> 03:41.160
I wasn't referring,

03:41.228 --> 03:44.096
nor will I ever refer,
to your butt, Mother.

03:44.506 --> 03:47.608
I simply don't believe
your wounded bird story.

03:47.676 --> 03:49.543
You're the goddess of all creation.

03:50.612 --> 03:52.680
Not anymore, unfortunately.

03:52.747 --> 03:54.448
Now I'm just trapped in this stinky human

03:54.516 --> 03:56.117
with the exceptional ass.

03:56.184 --> 03:59.520
I swear, all I've done for three
days is wander this cesspool,

03:59.588 --> 04:02.323
asking these vacuous
cretins how to find you.

04:06.328 --> 04:07.962
What are you doing?

04:08.029 --> 04:09.200
Calling Amenadiel.

04:09.203 --> 04:11.232
Oh!

04:11.299 --> 04:12.900
Wonderful. He's here, too?

04:12.968 --> 04:15.240
Yes. And he'll be the one
taking you back to Hell, so...

04:15.241 --> 04:16.737
What?!

04:16.805 --> 04:18.139
Why?

04:18.206 --> 04:20.541
Because you're dangerous and terrifying.

04:20.608 --> 04:23.344
I promise you I'm not
here to hurt anyone.

04:23.411 --> 04:26.175
You have to believe me.

04:26.176 --> 04:28.582
My entire focus has been
on finding you, son.

04:28.650 --> 04:30.284
So you can eviscerate me? Got it.

04:30.352 --> 04:33.821
No. We've wasted enough
time being... estranged.

04:33.889 --> 04:36.557
I'd do anything to rectify that now.

04:36.625 --> 04:38.659
Sure you don't mean "revenge that"?

04:38.727 --> 04:42.429
Lucifer, your father put me in Hell.

04:42.497 --> 04:44.131
Not you. I know that.

04:44.199 --> 04:45.132
Yes.

04:45.200 --> 04:47.635
But I was your warden.

04:47.702 --> 04:49.036
Not by choice.

04:49.104 --> 04:50.804
We were both wronged.

04:53.642 --> 04:56.577
But you could have at least visited me.

04:56.645 --> 04:58.846
Oh, I'm sorry.

04:58.914 --> 05:01.782
When Dad cast me out,
who stood by and did nothing?

05:01.850 --> 05:04.585
Hint: it's a palindrome for "mum."

05:04.653 --> 05:08.222
Well, maybe if you had talked
to me in Hell instead of sending

05:08.290 --> 05:09.657
your little demon torturer,

05:09.724 --> 05:11.358
I could've explained the whole thing.

05:11.900 --> 05:13.167
You're right, you're right.

05:13.235 --> 05:16.103
But I'm here now, so by all means, explain.

05:17.673 --> 05:21.175
You wouldn't believe me.

05:21.243 --> 05:25.780
I know how suspicious
and untrusting you are.

05:25.847 --> 05:28.249
You don't know anything about me.

05:28.316 --> 05:30.518
Lucifer.

05:30.585 --> 05:32.453
I'm your mother.

05:32.521 --> 05:36.323
Not for a very, very long time.

05:37.726 --> 05:40.961
Well, I want to be now.

05:47.736 --> 05:50.504
Then I'm going to need you to prove

05:50.572 --> 05:52.707
your little origin story to me.

05:54.543 --> 05:55.910
We'll retrace your steps.

05:55.977 --> 05:58.045
If I don't find a trail
of bloodshed and carnage,

05:58.113 --> 05:59.714
then perhaps I'll believe you.

05:59.781 --> 06:03.684
Fine. We'll begin where I found
the tiny spear in my neck.

06:03.752 --> 06:05.326
- Fine.
- Hmm.

06:05.462 --> 06:07.398
Gonna need to get you some clean clothes.

06:07.422 --> 06:10.491
Humans tend to frown
at the sight of blood.

06:10.559 --> 06:12.326
Yes.

06:12.394 --> 06:13.516
I've noticed.

06:27.476 --> 06:29.777
Uh, just leave it, would you?

06:29.845 --> 06:31.846
Gosh, perhaps we shouldn't
have borrowed from Maze.

06:31.913 --> 06:34.949
Her clothing is insufficient.

06:35.016 --> 06:36.784
Yes. Half my hide is exposed.

06:36.852 --> 06:39.186
Human attire is very impractical.

06:39.254 --> 06:40.821
They're morons, aren't they?

06:40.889 --> 06:42.969
Oh. So you admit you revile them?

06:42.970 --> 06:44.535
To revile them would
be to care about them,

06:44.559 --> 06:47.161
which I do not.

06:53.502 --> 06:55.220
Then all those rumors

06:55.223 --> 06:57.204
about why Dad sent you to Hell...

06:57.272 --> 06:58.172
the plagues,

06:58.240 --> 07:01.475
the floods... they weren't you?

07:01.543 --> 07:02.676
Well...

07:02.744 --> 07:05.045
Yeah. That's what I thought.

07:05.113 --> 07:06.247
I was angry.

07:06.314 --> 07:07.615
But humans weren't

07:07.682 --> 07:10.317
the reason your father
and I were fighting.

07:10.385 --> 07:12.052
At least, not then.

07:12.120 --> 07:13.921
Uh, Mum?

07:13.989 --> 07:14.989
Hmm?

07:21.530 --> 07:23.597
I think you left out a minor detail.

07:23.665 --> 07:25.332
Oh, dear.

07:29.274 --> 07:35.116
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

07:41.838 --> 07:45.107
Liar, liar, slutty dress on fire, Mother.

07:45.175 --> 07:46.709
Whoever destroyed my human suit

07:46.777 --> 07:49.912
must have killed this little
imp as well, it's obvious.

07:50.135 --> 07:52.281
Lucifer, honey,

07:52.349 --> 07:55.751
why would I bring you here
just to disprove my story?

07:55.819 --> 07:57.386
I don't know.

07:57.454 --> 07:59.689
But that's exactly what
I'm going to find out.

07:59.756 --> 08:02.558
Management.

08:03.760 --> 08:05.995
- Don't... Wait! Wait.
- Why?

08:06.063 --> 08:08.464
Because there is a dead
man lying on the bed.

08:08.532 --> 08:10.533
Humans don't like that sort of thing.

08:10.601 --> 08:12.481
- Fine. Then let's fly out the window.
- What...

08:12.536 --> 08:15.104
I don't have wings anymore, Mum.

08:15.172 --> 08:16.539
What?

08:16.607 --> 08:18.774
It's a long story.

08:18.842 --> 08:19.842
Come on. This way.

08:22.846 --> 08:24.347
Management.

08:25.849 --> 08:27.650
Yeah, this way.

08:27.718 --> 08:29.485
What happened to your wings, son?

08:29.553 --> 08:30.920
I cut them off.

08:30.988 --> 08:33.022
Why would you...? I mean, come to Earth,

08:33.090 --> 08:35.357
get a haircut or something,
but that's a little extreme.

08:35.424 --> 08:37.293
Hey, bud.

08:38.929 --> 08:40.196
Can I tag in next?

08:40.263 --> 08:41.364
Excuse me?

08:41.431 --> 08:42.664
With the lady.

08:42.732 --> 08:44.066
How much?

08:44.134 --> 08:46.335
This one you could kill. Come on.

08:47.304 --> 08:48.571
I'm joking!

08:48.639 --> 08:51.040
I'm joking, Mother.

08:51.108 --> 08:52.408
Gosh.

08:52.476 --> 08:54.110
You're gonna have to lose those clothes.

08:54.177 --> 08:55.711
They're a serious problem.

08:55.779 --> 08:57.313
Taking you home,

08:57.381 --> 09:00.616
'cause this being out in public
thing obviously isn't working.

09:00.684 --> 09:03.085
And then I'm gonna see my colleague...

09:03.153 --> 09:04.487
Mum!

09:04.554 --> 09:06.055
- Yes?
- You're naked!

09:06.123 --> 09:09.525
Well, you said the clothes were
a problem, so problem solved.

09:09.593 --> 09:12.628
Get in the bloody car, will you?!

09:12.696 --> 09:14.730
God. Traumatized for eternity now,

09:14.798 --> 09:16.132
so thank you very much for that.

09:31.348 --> 09:32.581
Maze?

09:32.649 --> 09:34.050
Ah, good, you're still here.

09:34.117 --> 09:35.384
I have a job for you.

09:35.452 --> 09:37.386
On my way out, Lucifer. No more jobs.

09:37.454 --> 09:39.065
Yes, yes, I know.
You don't work for me anymore.

09:39.089 --> 09:42.825
Very clear. But I have a feeling
you're gonna love this one.

09:42.893 --> 09:44.927
Just think of it as a parting gift.

09:44.995 --> 09:46.195
Come on.

09:47.798 --> 09:51.500
Hello, Mazikeen.

09:54.538 --> 09:56.038
Is that her?

09:56.106 --> 09:57.106
Mm-hmm.

09:57.140 --> 09:58.374
In a human body?

09:58.442 --> 09:59.909
Well, unfortunately.

10:00.744 --> 10:02.011
For you.

10:02.079 --> 10:05.181
I appreciate your enthusiasm,
Maze, but hands off.

10:05.248 --> 10:06.348
What?

10:06.416 --> 10:07.616
You're kidding.

10:08.585 --> 10:11.187
Millennia, Lucifer...

10:11.254 --> 10:13.522
with no physical form.

10:15.292 --> 10:17.050
But now...

10:19.645 --> 10:21.430
...look at all that flesh.

10:21.462 --> 10:23.042
Yes, but sorry,
dear. No torture.

10:23.066 --> 10:24.800
Just don't let her out of your sight.

10:24.868 --> 10:27.069
Until I've worked out
whether she's lying or not,

10:27.137 --> 10:28.370
she can't be trusted.

10:30.127 --> 10:31.722
You want me to babysit?

10:31.878 --> 10:34.520
Well, "my mum in the body of
a disturbingly hot woman"-sit,

10:34.544 --> 10:36.412
but yes, for now.

10:40.117 --> 10:42.351
Mmm.

10:57.701 --> 11:01.036
I was just trying to give
Tammy Twinkletoes a makeover.

11:05.942 --> 11:09.245
Honey, you... you popped out her eye.

11:09.312 --> 11:11.147
Yeah.

11:11.214 --> 11:12.748
That was an accident.

11:12.816 --> 11:15.851
Well, I think she looks rather fetching.

11:15.919 --> 11:17.019
Lucifer.

11:17.087 --> 11:19.855
Hello, Detective. Sir Douche. Offspring.

11:19.923 --> 11:21.757
You know, I bet you're actually

11:21.825 --> 11:23.592
behind this, aren't you? Sadly, no.

11:23.660 --> 11:25.561
Can't take the credit, but I do approve.

11:25.629 --> 11:27.429
Can we get to work now, please?

11:27.497 --> 11:30.132
I'm just wondering if there's
any fresh homicides popped up.

11:31.434 --> 11:32.812
Ooh, you know, when you make that face,

11:32.836 --> 11:34.236
you look a bit like the doll.

11:39.376 --> 11:40.810
- Hey.
- Ah, look.

11:40.877 --> 11:43.379
You can disco a bad guy into confessing.

11:43.446 --> 11:44.980
This isn't a game; this is parenting.

11:45.048 --> 11:46.382
And it's important.

11:46.449 --> 11:48.918
She mutilated Tammy Twinkletoes.

11:48.985 --> 11:50.519
And I'm sure there's a real mutilation

11:50.587 --> 11:52.321
out there to solve as we speak.

11:52.389 --> 11:53.722
Something that screams

11:53.790 --> 11:56.325
"crazed witchy woman on a rampage" perhaps?

11:56.393 --> 11:58.627
What? Not that I know of.

11:58.695 --> 12:01.063
Okay, I'm gonna go back in there.

12:01.131 --> 12:02.064
Detective!

12:02.132 --> 12:03.499
Just a doll.

12:03.567 --> 12:05.734
I don't know what all the fuss is about.

12:05.802 --> 12:08.470
It's not just a doll, it's manipulation.

12:08.538 --> 12:10.840
- What?
- Trixie's best friend Landa got a new

12:10.907 --> 12:12.842
All-American doll, and
now Trixie wants one.

12:12.909 --> 12:14.810
So what does she do?
She destroys her old doll,

12:14.878 --> 12:16.779
- expecting me to replace it.
- Mm, impressive.

12:16.847 --> 12:19.815
But, then, I'd expect nothing
less from the shrewd little minx.

12:19.883 --> 12:21.660
Why don't you comply,
then we can get on, yes?

12:21.684 --> 12:24.753
No. And I'd appreciate it if you
don't undermine my authority.

12:24.821 --> 12:26.021
But you're being a bad mother.

12:26.089 --> 12:27.923
Abandon the child in its time of need,

12:27.991 --> 12:29.735
and it won't trust you in the future.

12:29.759 --> 12:31.560
- Is that what you want, Detective?
- Decker.

12:31.628 --> 12:33.229
Yeah.

12:33.296 --> 12:35.264
Got it.

12:35.332 --> 12:37.266
New case. Hotel Gleam.

12:37.334 --> 12:39.702
Ah, finally! Fantastic news.

12:43.607 --> 12:45.507
He's practically a kid.

12:45.575 --> 12:47.270
Yeah, 19 or so.

12:47.271 --> 12:48.790
How long has he been here?

12:48.845 --> 12:50.579
I don't know, maybe a few days.

12:50.647 --> 12:51.981
Guess the maid really took

12:52.048 --> 12:53.816
the "do not disturb" sign seriously.

12:53.884 --> 12:58.354
Cause of death: single
puncture wound to the neck.

12:58.421 --> 13:00.389
I'm thinking ice pick.

13:00.457 --> 13:01.924
Or a screwdriver, perhaps.

13:01.992 --> 13:03.259
Five-inch, head?

13:03.326 --> 13:04.827
Huh.

13:04.895 --> 13:06.562
Yeah. Maybe.

13:06.630 --> 13:07.830
You're good.

13:07.898 --> 13:08.964
I know. Detective,

13:09.032 --> 13:11.033
interesting pool of blood through here.

13:15.272 --> 13:17.673
I'm assuming it belongs to Cinderella here.

13:17.741 --> 13:20.276
Cinderella? Sure we don't
mean evil stepmother?

13:20.343 --> 13:22.278
Really?

13:22.345 --> 13:25.047
Are we really still on the whole
"my mother did it" thing?

13:25.115 --> 13:27.116
I thought she was responsible
for our last murder.

13:27.795 --> 13:29.373
What, you're just throwing homicides at her

13:29.397 --> 13:31.365
- until one sticks?
- No, I'm simply saying

13:31.432 --> 13:33.534
that the missing woman
may well be our killer.

13:33.601 --> 13:35.802
A murderous psycho whose rampage started

13:35.870 --> 13:37.271
by impaling that poor lad.

13:37.338 --> 13:39.740
Okay, my guess is that this
is an affair gone wrong.

13:39.807 --> 13:43.143
Jealous husband follows
his cheating wife here.

13:43.211 --> 13:45.212
He kills the young lover, he wounds her,

13:45.280 --> 13:47.748
and then he drags her home or she escapes.

13:47.815 --> 13:49.182
Definitely the latter.

13:49.250 --> 13:50.394
Well, we would know more

13:50.418 --> 13:51.952
if she had left more than a shoe.

13:52.020 --> 13:54.621
We don't have a purse.

13:54.689 --> 13:56.189
No wallet, no keys.

13:56.257 --> 13:58.025
Would the woman's phone help?

13:58.092 --> 14:00.027
Well, yes, of course, but we don't have...

14:00.094 --> 14:02.062
A phone!

14:04.499 --> 14:05.899
Wow!

14:05.967 --> 14:07.601
Good eye, Luce!

14:08.937 --> 14:10.137
...ifer.

14:10.204 --> 14:12.172
I'll get this back to the lab.

14:12.240 --> 14:13.707
See if I can restore it.

14:13.775 --> 14:15.615
Yeah, fast as you can,
Ella, we have to proceed

14:15.643 --> 14:17.520
as if this missing woman
is still alive, okay?

14:17.539 --> 14:19.914
- Yeah.
- I don't want to find another body.

14:19.981 --> 14:22.516
Trust me, you will not find another body.

14:23.585 --> 14:25.085
I found a body.

14:32.856 --> 14:34.992
She's a maid at the hotel.

14:35.130 --> 14:37.843
Explains why she didn't
find our dead guy.

14:37.910 --> 14:40.112
'Cause, you know, she was dead.

14:40.179 --> 14:41.947
Anyway, okay.

14:42.014 --> 14:43.659
No open wounds, so she's
definitely not our Cinderella

14:43.683 --> 14:44.793
who bled all over the place.

14:44.817 --> 14:46.151
You see the bruising

14:46.219 --> 14:47.563
and the semi-circular marks on her neck?

14:47.587 --> 14:49.087
- Strangled.
- Aha.

14:49.155 --> 14:51.923
Long fingernails,
which means the killer's female.

14:51.991 --> 14:54.059
Not necessarily.
I mean, the marks aren't deep.

14:54.127 --> 14:55.160
It could just be a dude

14:55.228 --> 14:56.995
- who's not serious man-groomer.
- Come on.

14:57.063 --> 14:58.764
It's so obvious, your Cinder-hellion

14:58.831 --> 15:01.133
had just plunged a
screwdriver into the poor lad,

15:01.200 --> 15:02.711
when she was interrupted
by the chambermaid,

15:02.735 --> 15:04.480
who she then snuffed
out with her bare hands.

15:04.504 --> 15:05.537
Chambermaid?

15:05.605 --> 15:06.805
Who's the killer, Mrs. Peacock

15:06.873 --> 15:08.183
in the library with the candlestick?

15:08.207 --> 15:09.250
I love that game.

15:09.251 --> 15:11.520
I really don't think it's
the missing woman, Lucifer.

15:11.544 --> 15:13.260
It's a little unusual for a
woman to strangle someone.

15:13.261 --> 15:16.081
But look at the size of the bruising,
clearly not man hands.

15:16.149 --> 15:18.617
I've seen some guys with
some pretty tiny lady hands.

15:18.684 --> 15:19.818
Dan doesn't count.

15:19.886 --> 15:21.163
- Come on.
- Okay, regardless,

15:21.187 --> 15:22.888
the maid's death wasn't planned.

15:22.955 --> 15:25.157
I still think we're
looking at a third party...

15:25.224 --> 15:27.622
someone attacking the couple
when the maid entered.

15:27.783 --> 15:30.038
The killer then dragged
the maid into the bedroom,

15:30.062 --> 15:31.696
where they struggled until he

15:31.764 --> 15:33.632
finally managed to strangle her.

15:33.699 --> 15:35.611
Which gave our Cinderella time
to get the hell out of there.

15:35.635 --> 15:36.868
I couldn't agree less.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.403
And she needs to go straight to Hell

15:38.471 --> 15:39.938
as soon as possible.

15:40.006 --> 15:41.981
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to make a call.

15:42.544 --> 15:44.264
Oh, did we get anything on that cell phone?

15:44.312 --> 15:46.547
Oh, right! Uh, totally forgot.

15:47.382 --> 15:48.816
No, no.

15:48.883 --> 15:50.361
Could not recover anything
from the SIM card.

15:50.385 --> 15:52.352
Water and phones, bad news.

15:52.420 --> 15:54.298
I dropped mine in the
toilet once... that sucked.

15:54.322 --> 15:56.200
- Damn. So much for that.
- Had to reach in, I didn't have my gloves.

15:56.224 --> 15:57.691
Uh, no.

15:57.759 --> 16:00.527
No, 'cause I did get a
serial number off of it,

16:00.595 --> 16:02.930
so I know who bought it, at least.

16:02.997 --> 16:04.665
Richards and Wheeler.

16:04.732 --> 16:06.500
High-end law firm in Beverly Hills.

16:06.568 --> 16:07.468
Cool.

16:07.535 --> 16:08.855
Next time, if you want, you know,

16:08.903 --> 16:12.005
you can just lead with that information.

16:12.073 --> 16:13.574
If you want.

16:13.641 --> 16:15.209
Okay, boss, where do you want me?

16:15.276 --> 16:17.811
I'm not your boss, I'm just,
you know, kind of...

16:17.879 --> 16:18.979
My boss.

16:19.047 --> 16:20.380
It's okay, Chloe.

16:20.448 --> 16:22.733
I've accepted my demotion like a big boy.

16:22.734 --> 16:25.430
And besides, it's kind of hot
when you give me orders.

16:26.020 --> 16:27.788
Sorry.

16:27.856 --> 16:29.490
Old habits.

16:29.557 --> 16:31.625
Why don't you
start with missing persons,

16:31.693 --> 16:33.337
see if there are any new
leads on our Cinderella.

16:33.361 --> 16:35.896
Lucifer and I will go to the law firm.

16:35.964 --> 16:37.731
- Okay.
- Okay.

16:37.799 --> 16:38.832
Lucifer.

16:38.900 --> 16:40.567
- Lucifer.
- Hmm?

16:42.003 --> 16:43.470
Oh. Uh, are you praying or...?

16:43.538 --> 16:45.205
Yes. Usually works.

16:45.273 --> 16:47.407
He must've gone for a wank or something.

16:48.743 --> 16:51.178
Come on, Amenadiel, where are you?

16:53.815 --> 16:55.916
Hello?

16:55.984 --> 16:57.351
Is this thing on?

16:57.418 --> 16:59.953
I keep waiting for God to talk back to me,
too.

17:00.021 --> 17:02.656
But you know what,
don't get discouraged, okay?

17:02.724 --> 17:04.223
He is listening, it's just

17:04.291 --> 17:06.926
a one-way intercom kind of deal.

17:12.666 --> 17:15.269
Come on, brother, where are you?

17:24.244 --> 17:26.213
Linda.

17:27.982 --> 17:31.451
Surprised to see you're still coming in.

17:31.519 --> 17:33.587
I mean, after all, this is a...

17:33.655 --> 17:37.882
a real facility for real
therapists with real patients.

17:38.035 --> 17:39.853
Unfortunately,
I can't talk right now, Linda.

17:39.854 --> 17:40.727
I've got some research to do.

17:40.795 --> 17:41.628
Oh, sure, I bet.

17:41.696 --> 17:43.430
Learning more about psychiatry?

17:44.228 --> 17:46.763
Or is it time to switch it up?
Be a lawyer maybe.

17:46.830 --> 17:48.398
Astronaut.

17:48.465 --> 17:49.699
I understand.

17:49.767 --> 17:51.963
You're upset that I told
you I was a therapist.

17:52.087 --> 17:56.072
Maybe you are one,
'cause your intuition's uncanny.

17:56.140 --> 17:59.442
Linda, listen. I did what
I had to do, all right?

17:59.510 --> 18:01.030
Now, you wouldn't understand this,

18:01.032 --> 18:03.056
but I was dealing with
matters of great importance.

18:03.080 --> 18:04.447
I didn't have a choice.

18:04.515 --> 18:06.149
Yes, you did.

18:07.320 --> 18:08.520
You used me.

18:08.588 --> 18:11.923
You didn't have to do that.

18:11.991 --> 18:15.994
I'm used to my patients lying
to me, not my colleagues.

18:16.062 --> 18:18.630
Not my friends.

18:18.698 --> 18:22.601
I confided in you, trusted you.

18:22.668 --> 18:24.970
And you betrayed that trust.

18:26.672 --> 18:28.073
It is difficult to explain,

18:28.140 --> 18:32.277
but things have been very trying for me.

18:32.345 --> 18:33.845
Mm-hmm.

18:33.913 --> 18:35.880
Maybe if you didn't think
so much about yourself

18:35.948 --> 18:38.650
and more about how you treat others,

18:38.718 --> 18:40.852
things wouldn't be so trying.

18:42.755 --> 18:45.056
It's called karma.

18:46.058 --> 18:48.293
Might want to research that.

19:06.579 --> 19:08.546
All right, the most
effective way to do this

19:08.614 --> 19:10.482
is with a discreet and systematic approach.

19:10.549 --> 19:11.783
Understood.

19:11.851 --> 19:13.618
We can start with the partners and then...

19:13.686 --> 19:16.554
Attention, lawyers! Hello!

19:16.622 --> 19:18.223
Hello. Attention, please.

19:18.290 --> 19:22.293
Uh, now, does anyone recognize
this critical piece of evidence

19:22.361 --> 19:24.562
found at a gruesome crime scene?

19:24.630 --> 19:25.997
Yeah. See?

19:26.065 --> 19:27.966
That's our corporate-issue phone.

19:28.034 --> 19:29.167
We all have one.

19:29.235 --> 19:30.368
That could be anybody's.

19:30.436 --> 19:32.037
Right.

19:32.104 --> 19:32.837
What about this

19:32.905 --> 19:34.239
Louboutin power pump

19:34.306 --> 19:37.409
with the ombré finish in
a size, uh... seven?

19:37.476 --> 19:39.077
- Six, U.K.
- Lucifer...

19:39.145 --> 19:40.178
Oh, my God.

19:40.246 --> 19:42.280
Th-That's Charlotte's shoe.

19:42.348 --> 19:44.349
Is she okay?

19:44.417 --> 19:46.051
Prince Charming, I presume.

19:47.353 --> 19:49.554
Richards. Charlotte Richards.

19:49.622 --> 19:50.955
She's the owner of this firm.

19:51.023 --> 19:53.091
When she didn't come into
the office, I just...

19:53.159 --> 19:56.194
assumed she was out of town on a case.

19:56.262 --> 19:59.364
Was this man involved in any of
those cases, by chance?

20:01.667 --> 20:03.568
- Oh, my God, is he...?
- Dead as a doornail.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.470
Yes. Or in this case, a door screw,

20:05.538 --> 20:07.539
'cause the hole in his
neck's from a screwdriver.

20:07.606 --> 20:09.651
And I happen to think that
Charlotte may well have done...

20:09.675 --> 20:12.210
Could provide us with more...

20:12.278 --> 20:14.446
information on his death.

20:14.513 --> 20:17.015
Well, I-I don't recognize him.

20:17.083 --> 20:19.284
Wait, does that mean
you think Charlotte is alive?

20:19.351 --> 20:20.418
Define "alive."

20:20.486 --> 20:22.754
When was the last time you saw her?

20:33.165 --> 20:34.699
I did this!

20:34.767 --> 20:36.134
Oh, Charlotte, I'm so sorry!

20:36.202 --> 20:37.936
All right, Bradley, listen up,

20:38.003 --> 20:40.205
'cause I've got personal
trust issues at stake here.

20:40.272 --> 20:41.973
Brad, look at me.

20:44.643 --> 20:47.178
Did you want Charlotte gone?

20:48.614 --> 20:50.782
No. No.

20:50.850 --> 20:52.517
That's the last thing I wanted.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.819
Right. Then what do you desire?

20:54.887 --> 20:57.555
T-To be with Charlotte.

20:57.623 --> 20:59.157
We were in love.

20:59.225 --> 21:00.959
Mr. Wheeler,

21:01.026 --> 21:06.231
um, would Charlotte maybe have, um...

21:06.298 --> 21:08.967
also... slept with the guy in the photo?

21:09.034 --> 21:09.901
No.

21:09.969 --> 21:12.737
We were completely monogamous.

21:12.805 --> 21:14.939
She wouldn't even sleep
with her own husband.

21:16.675 --> 21:18.276
She was married already?

21:18.344 --> 21:21.045
Yeah, but she hated that guy.

21:31.357 --> 21:33.091
Sorry about the mess.

21:33.159 --> 21:35.293
I'm sorry about those shoes.

21:35.361 --> 21:36.694
Excuse me?

21:36.762 --> 21:38.296
Mr. Richards, when was the last time

21:38.364 --> 21:39.464
your wife was home?

21:39.532 --> 21:40.832
Oh, God, uh...

21:40.900 --> 21:43.134
Three days ago, maybe.

21:43.202 --> 21:44.936
You didn't file a missing person's report?

21:45.004 --> 21:48.139
She's always traveling.
Doesn't always tell me when.

21:48.207 --> 21:50.318
Did she tell you she was
bonking her associate Bradley?

21:50.342 --> 21:52.010
Lucifer.

21:53.078 --> 21:54.078
Did she?

21:54.146 --> 21:55.180
I knew.

21:55.247 --> 21:56.247
What could I do?

21:56.315 --> 21:57.582
Well, one option would be

21:57.650 --> 21:59.984
to stab her in the neck with a screwdriver.

22:00.052 --> 22:02.320
Do you recognize this man?

22:02.388 --> 22:03.555
Oh, God.

22:03.622 --> 22:05.056
Uh... h-he came by

22:05.124 --> 22:08.193
the house with a package for
Charlotte, uh, last week.

22:08.260 --> 22:09.961
Pretty sure it was, like, a work thing.

22:10.029 --> 22:12.030
Well, it depends what kind
of package, doesn't it?

22:12.097 --> 22:14.666
- Uh, I-is Charlotte all right?
- Can you account

22:14.733 --> 22:16.434
- for the last three days?
- Yeah.

22:16.502 --> 22:18.436
I've been up to my ears in puke.

22:18.504 --> 22:20.071
My kids are home sick.

22:20.139 --> 22:22.974
Uh, I haven't left the house since Monday.

22:23.042 --> 22:24.709
And not showered since, I see.

22:24.777 --> 22:26.344
Are your children home?

22:26.412 --> 22:27.589
I'd like to confirm with them.

22:27.613 --> 22:29.714
Yeah, sure. Uh, just down the hall,

22:29.782 --> 22:32.183
and, uh, uh...

22:32.251 --> 22:34.619
When exactly did you
surrender your manhood?

22:34.687 --> 22:35.854
Excuse me?

22:35.921 --> 22:38.089
I mean, I'm all for stay-at-home dads,

22:38.157 --> 22:39.791
and believe me, I personally commend you

22:39.859 --> 22:41.259
for not abandoning your children,

22:41.327 --> 22:43.261
but that's still no reason to give up.

22:43.329 --> 22:45.763
Oh, I-I... I haven't given up. I'm...

22:45.831 --> 22:48.433
Mr. Richards, you have an
entire slice of salami

22:48.500 --> 22:50.235
stuck to your shirt.

22:51.370 --> 22:52.303
Oh, God.

22:52.371 --> 22:53.571
Come on.

22:53.639 --> 22:55.106
Where's your closet? Up here?

22:55.174 --> 22:56.174
Mm.

22:56.242 --> 22:58.109
Oh, goody. They come in more colors.

22:58.177 --> 22:59.978
There's only one body part

23:00.045 --> 23:01.412
- rubber should be worn on.
- Oh!

23:01.480 --> 23:02.714
Not that you'd know.

23:02.781 --> 23:04.182
You've clearly castrated yourself.

23:04.250 --> 23:06.384
But don't worry. I'm here to help.

23:06.452 --> 23:07.952
Hawaiian print?

23:08.020 --> 23:10.488
The eighth deadly sin. Out.

23:10.556 --> 23:12.790
Dave Matthews tribute tank.

23:12.858 --> 23:14.926
Now I'm doubting your sanity.

23:14.994 --> 23:16.794
What have we got? Ah! Here we go.

23:16.862 --> 23:18.796
This is more promising.

23:18.864 --> 23:20.265
Not worn since the...?

23:20.332 --> 23:22.200
- Wedding.
- That's what I thought, right.

23:22.268 --> 23:23.501
Let's have a look.

23:23.569 --> 23:25.136
Come on.

23:25.204 --> 23:27.605
Come on!

23:29.742 --> 23:32.277
Is that, uh...

23:32.344 --> 23:33.778
Cocaine!

23:33.846 --> 23:35.580
Oh, and the good stuff, as well.

23:35.648 --> 23:39.083
Ah, Detective, welcome to the party.

23:46.705 --> 23:48.306
Ready in a minute.

23:48.373 --> 23:51.242
You know, feeding a whole
ball team isn't too big a job

23:51.310 --> 23:53.511
when you have macaroni
and cheese dinner handy.

23:53.579 --> 23:55.179
Okay, boys, come and get it!

23:55.247 --> 23:59.417
Mazikeen, what is this
strange gooey substance

23:59.485 --> 24:01.586
that this boy is cooing about?

24:01.653 --> 24:03.988
You watching porn?

24:11.296 --> 24:12.697
What is this?

24:12.764 --> 24:14.132
It's like money.

24:14.199 --> 24:17.468
Humans use it to buy
things they can't afford.

24:17.536 --> 24:18.803
Wish I'd found this

24:18.871 --> 24:20.938
before I ate out of those street bins.

24:22.074 --> 24:24.275
Humans are silly animals, aren't they?

24:24.343 --> 24:27.411
Weak. Fragile.

24:27.479 --> 24:29.113
That's what I'm counting on.

24:30.582 --> 24:33.851
Now... where were we?

24:45.264 --> 24:47.165
That's a lot of coke.

24:47.232 --> 24:49.834
Think the attorney's husband was dealing?

24:49.902 --> 24:52.370
I don't think he's the
entrepreneurial type.

24:52.437 --> 24:54.238
Thinking maybe the lawyer was.

24:54.306 --> 24:56.466
Doesn't make a whole lot of sense,
but it would explain

24:56.508 --> 24:58.743
why she ended up bleeding
in that hotel room.

24:58.810 --> 25:02.313
Well, maybe the kid was her
street dealer or something.

25:02.381 --> 25:05.216
Yeah, maybe. Anyhow, Ella got
a big fat print off the plastic.

25:05.284 --> 25:06.651
I'm running it through AFIS now.

25:06.718 --> 25:08.619
What's with the box?

25:08.687 --> 25:10.154
Delivery for you.

25:10.222 --> 25:11.589
- What?
- Yeah.

25:15.994 --> 25:18.796
Dan, I thought we talked about this.

25:18.864 --> 25:20.331
A united front, especially now.

25:20.399 --> 25:22.533
Hey, don't look at me.

25:22.601 --> 25:23.634
Oh, she's here! Lovely.

25:23.702 --> 25:25.203
Did the mini kitchen come, too?

25:25.270 --> 25:27.972
Lucifer, you shouldn't
have gotten her the doll.

25:28.040 --> 25:29.520
It's fine. You can say it's from you.

25:30.943 --> 25:32.610
Oh. Hello.

25:32.678 --> 25:34.378
Luis Mendoza.

25:34.758 --> 25:36.959
He's a known associate of
drug kingpin Victor Perez.

25:37.027 --> 25:38.427
He's a scary dude.

25:38.495 --> 25:39.662
Smart though,

25:39.730 --> 25:41.641
to partner up with a
high-powered defense attorney.

25:41.665 --> 25:44.200
Which would explain why he's
eluded the FBI for years.

25:44.268 --> 25:46.068
I have a friend in the Bureau.

25:46.136 --> 25:47.514
I'll call him, I'll see
what I can find out.

25:47.538 --> 25:49.005
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

25:49.072 --> 25:51.874
Oh, look, she comes with an
adorable little chocolate cake.

25:51.942 --> 25:53.042
Your child's favorite.

25:53.110 --> 25:55.011
I will deal with you later.

25:56.079 --> 25:58.781
You're welcome.

26:03.487 --> 26:05.621
Eeny meeny miney...

26:11.328 --> 26:14.230
You are wasting your time, Mazikeen.

26:14.298 --> 26:15.498
You couldn't break me in Hell.

26:15.532 --> 26:17.333
What makes you think you could do it here?

26:17.401 --> 26:20.536
Maybe I couldn't hurt you
because you weren't human.

26:20.604 --> 26:22.171
Well, now you are.

26:22.239 --> 26:24.840
No, it's because I wasn't
guilty of anything.

26:24.908 --> 26:27.243
Hell gives the damned what they deserve.

26:27.311 --> 26:29.779
I didn't deserve to be punished.

26:29.846 --> 26:31.180
And you know it.

26:31.248 --> 26:32.715
No.

26:32.783 --> 26:35.851
I think it's because I just
didn't find your weak spot.

26:35.919 --> 26:38.254
Everyone has one.

26:38.322 --> 26:40.723
Human bodies have several.

26:40.791 --> 26:42.124
Careful.

26:42.192 --> 26:43.893
This body only heals once,

26:43.961 --> 26:45.661
and Lucifer told you not to harm me.

26:45.729 --> 26:49.165
You may have him confused
right now, but he's smart.

26:49.232 --> 26:53.069
He'll come around, see you
for who you really are.

26:53.136 --> 26:55.304
A mother who loves her son.

26:55.372 --> 26:58.541
Loving mothers don't abandon their sons.

26:58.609 --> 27:02.311
I threaten your relationship
with him, don't I?

27:03.714 --> 27:05.281
Nice try.

27:06.950 --> 27:09.218
Even though you say you're on your way out,

27:09.286 --> 27:11.754
you're still here doing his bidding.

27:11.822 --> 27:13.055
You need him.

27:13.123 --> 27:15.424
And if I stay, then he won't need you.

27:15.492 --> 27:17.627
Trust me, you won't stay.

27:17.694 --> 27:20.963
Lucifer made a deal with your
ex to take you back to Hell,

27:21.031 --> 27:24.000
and he doesn't break deals.

27:24.067 --> 27:26.969
Don't think he'd start with God.

27:27.871 --> 27:30.006
He made a deal?

27:30.907 --> 27:33.042
Wait.

27:37.381 --> 27:39.315
Is that a weak spot?

27:43.754 --> 27:47.123
Are those... tears?

27:51.228 --> 27:53.896
Oh!

27:55.799 --> 27:57.767
You're a bad mother.

27:57.834 --> 28:00.736
Really? I think you might
be projecting a little bit.

28:00.804 --> 28:02.271
Oh, really? How's that?

28:02.339 --> 28:04.974
Well, you keep trying to pin
murders on your own mother.

28:05.042 --> 28:08.310
I'm guessing you and her don't
have the best relationship.

28:08.378 --> 28:09.745
There.

28:09.813 --> 28:12.848
At least I get to keep the
cute little chocolate cake.

28:12.916 --> 28:14.067
Oh, come on.

28:14.218 --> 28:16.052
Talked to Agent Colburn.

28:16.119 --> 28:17.196
Charlotte wasn't working for the cartel.

28:17.220 --> 28:18.654
She was working to bring it down.

28:18.722 --> 28:20.322
So was that poor kid.

28:21.014 --> 28:22.848
His name's Marco Sanchez.
Got in over his head

28:22.916 --> 28:24.817
with the cartel,
was trying to make it right.

28:24.885 --> 28:27.724
So he was working with Charlotte
and the FBI as an informant?

28:27.876 --> 28:29.955
Trying to build a case
against Perez, yeah.

28:30.023 --> 28:32.992
That's why he and Charlotte were
meeting at the hotel in secret.

28:33.060 --> 28:34.060
But look at this.

28:34.094 --> 28:37.697
Perez's hit man is Jimmy the Carpenter.

28:37.764 --> 28:40.466
Want to take a guess at his M.O.?

28:40.534 --> 28:42.168
- Screwdriver?
- Boom.

28:42.235 --> 28:45.604
So the woman isn't a
ball of homicidal fury.

28:45.672 --> 28:47.673
No. Perez is.

28:47.741 --> 28:49.442
- Or his hit man anyway.
- Right.

28:49.497 --> 28:51.097
Well, shall we arrest
the Perez chap, then?

28:51.098 --> 28:53.045
The FBI has been trying
to do that for years.

28:53.113 --> 28:54.146
He's Teflon. He launders

28:54.214 --> 28:55.958
everything through his
tanning salon franchise.

28:55.982 --> 28:57.915
Yeah, we can't risk
derailing the FBI's case.

28:57.916 --> 29:00.273
We have to go through the court,
and we have to get a warrant.

29:00.297 --> 29:01.564
I'll see if I can rush one.

29:01.631 --> 29:02.842
Perez could have Charlotte now.

29:02.866 --> 29:04.467
Ah, I doubt it.

29:04.534 --> 29:06.669
Well, if not, he's after her.

29:06.737 --> 29:08.204
I don't doubt that.

29:08.271 --> 29:10.339
Yeah, why don't you stay
here and get the warrant.

29:10.407 --> 29:11.941
I think I've left the cooker on.

29:14.911 --> 29:16.979
Ah, lovely. You got one on the go.

29:17.047 --> 29:18.914
Right. New information, Maze.

29:18.982 --> 29:22.084
Seems Mum might not be a lying
sack of savagery after all,

29:22.152 --> 29:24.353
but it also seems that she's the target

29:24.421 --> 29:26.455
of a vicious cartel hit man.

29:26.523 --> 29:28.524
So you mustn't let her leave the penthouse

29:28.592 --> 29:30.726
until this whole mess is resolved. Right-o?

29:31.795 --> 29:33.929
Your mom's gone.

29:33.997 --> 29:35.464
What?

29:35.532 --> 29:38.267
Well, how did that happen, Maze?

29:38.335 --> 29:39.502
She tricked me,

29:39.569 --> 29:42.471
then head-butted me, then left.

29:44.341 --> 29:45.608
Sorry.

29:45.675 --> 29:47.643
Oh, well.

29:47.711 --> 29:49.712
Suppose the worst that could happen

29:49.780 --> 29:51.947
is that she's brutally murdered.

29:52.015 --> 29:54.116
If so, she'll just find a new body

29:54.184 --> 29:57.019
and run right back like a good mum, yeah?

29:57.087 --> 29:58.154
Or not.

29:58.221 --> 29:59.789
I may have let

29:59.856 --> 30:02.391
the whole deal with God thing slip.

30:02.459 --> 30:04.527
So I think she might be running away.

30:04.594 --> 30:07.797
So if she goes into a new body,
we'll never find her.

30:09.266 --> 30:12.735
Okay. Then we'll just have to
find her before that happens.

30:12.803 --> 30:15.204
I mean, how far can a celestial being

30:15.272 --> 30:17.466
trapped in a feeble human
body for the first time get?

30:17.597 --> 30:18.707
Well, let's see.

30:18.785 --> 30:21.287
She's stupid hot, wearing my clothes,

30:21.354 --> 30:23.489
and she's got a corporate credit card.

30:25.592 --> 30:27.159
Bollocks.

30:32.909 --> 30:36.327
Hello, chaps. Just looking for
the head of a big drug cartel.

30:36.395 --> 30:38.596
Is he home? Vicky?

30:38.664 --> 30:41.065
Victor?

30:41.133 --> 30:43.000
- Oh!
- Oh. Sorry, love. Vicky!

30:43.068 --> 30:44.836
Ah.

30:46.572 --> 30:49.073
Ah. Hello.

30:49.141 --> 30:50.408
Mr. Perez, I need you to know

30:50.476 --> 30:51.864
that I'm not here to talk to you

30:51.865 --> 30:53.321
about your criminal drug enterprise.

30:53.345 --> 30:54.779
I'm here about Charlotte Richards.

30:56.782 --> 31:00.752
Are you, by chance,
holding Charlotte prisoner?

31:00.819 --> 31:02.620
- Who?
- Right. I'll take that as a no.

31:02.688 --> 31:04.007
Here's my point.

31:04.008 --> 31:05.610
You may think that she's
dead, but she's not,

31:05.611 --> 31:06.929
which is fine, because you also think

31:06.930 --> 31:08.849
that she's still Charlotte,
which she's also not.

31:08.873 --> 31:10.240
- Is that clear?
- Ow!

31:10.308 --> 31:12.075
I simply need you to promise

31:12.143 --> 31:14.378
to stay away from Charlotte
Richards. Deal?

31:20.351 --> 31:22.452
Oh. Oh, look at that.

31:22.520 --> 31:26.690
Snowstorm in a tanning
salon. How ironic.

31:28.826 --> 31:30.661
Oh. Detective.

31:30.728 --> 31:33.168
I think Vicky here is ready for
a little bit of show-and-tell.

31:33.231 --> 31:34.898
Emphasis on the show.

31:38.469 --> 31:39.970
Wait a second.

31:40.038 --> 31:42.839
You think I had him killed
'cause he's a narc?

31:42.907 --> 31:44.408
Why would I do that?

31:44.475 --> 31:45.509
I was using him.

31:45.576 --> 31:48.078
Fed him bogus information on purpose.

31:48.146 --> 31:51.148
Had the FBI chasing after their own knobs.

31:51.215 --> 31:53.016
Kid was an asset.

31:53.084 --> 31:54.549
Be stupid to hurt him.

31:54.694 --> 31:57.164
Well, you forgot to tell your
buddy Jimmy the plan.

31:57.188 --> 31:59.323
Screwdriver to the neck.

31:59.390 --> 32:02.426
The Carpenter? He's dead.

32:03.928 --> 32:06.697
Did I throw a wrench in your works?

32:06.764 --> 32:09.299
Get it? Screwdriver? Wrench?

32:09.367 --> 32:10.767
It's a whole theme.

32:13.538 --> 32:16.740
Ah. How's my little drug kingpin panini?

32:16.808 --> 32:18.475
Not our guy.

32:18.543 --> 32:20.811
We have to find someone
connected to Marco and Charlotte

32:20.878 --> 32:22.646
that didn't know Jimmy
the Carpenter's dead.

32:22.714 --> 32:24.915
Well, Jimmy's dead? Tragic.

32:24.983 --> 32:28.719
So assuming the whole cartel
knows that, it rules them out

32:28.786 --> 32:31.121
and points us to the only way

32:31.189 --> 32:33.156
that Charlotte and Marco are connected:

32:33.224 --> 32:35.592
the law firm.

32:35.660 --> 32:37.461
Two shakedowns in one day. I'm in.

32:37.528 --> 32:39.663
No more shakedowns, no more
tanning booth shenanigans.

32:39.731 --> 32:42.132
You and I have been working
together long enough

32:42.200 --> 32:43.934
for you to know how to follow protocol.

32:44.002 --> 32:46.136
I'm sorry, Detective,
but Charlotte's in danger.

32:46.204 --> 32:47.738
We need to find her.

32:47.805 --> 32:50.640
How did she go from big bad
wolf to little lost lamb?

32:50.708 --> 32:52.642
Well, maybe she's a
wolf in sheep's clothing,

32:52.710 --> 32:56.179
but right now she needs
to return to the flock.

33:00.818 --> 33:02.219
Yeah, I worked on that case.

33:02.286 --> 33:04.187
I work on every case
that comes through here.

33:04.255 --> 33:06.323
Okay, but the Perez case was sensitive.

33:06.391 --> 33:07.657
You were the only one here

33:07.725 --> 33:09.259
besides Charlotte who knew about it.

33:09.327 --> 33:11.094
Which means you're also

33:11.162 --> 33:12.562
the only one here who was aware

33:12.630 --> 33:14.331
of Jimmy the Carpenter's methodology.

33:14.399 --> 33:16.867
Wait. You don't think that I...

33:16.934 --> 33:18.668
Got handy with a screwdriver

33:18.736 --> 33:21.571
and tried to pin it on the Perez cartel?

33:21.639 --> 33:23.740
Yes. That's insane.

33:23.808 --> 33:24.941
What's insane is

33:25.009 --> 33:26.249
a guy with a Harvard law degree

33:26.277 --> 33:27.944
still working as an associate.

33:28.012 --> 33:31.114
Yes. Passed up for partner
by old Tom Cruise out there.

33:31.182 --> 33:34.351
Guess you should've been
slipping the boss your top gun.

33:34.419 --> 33:36.386
If you're suggesting that I killed

33:36.454 --> 33:40.624
an innocent kid and my boss...
my mentor of 12 years...

33:40.691 --> 33:44.861
all out of professional
jealousy, you're crazy.

33:44.929 --> 33:46.363
Hold on.

33:46.431 --> 33:48.498
I don't believe that we
mentioned two murders.

33:48.566 --> 33:50.801
I mean, we showed you the
crime scene photo of Marco,

33:50.868 --> 33:52.969
- but not Charlotte.
- Lucifer...

33:53.037 --> 33:56.306
Well, given the information
that you presented...

33:56.374 --> 33:59.910
the phone, the shoe...
I just assumed that she was...

33:59.977 --> 34:01.545
Dead? No.

34:01.612 --> 34:04.514
Just missing. And if we find
her alive, it's gonna be

34:04.582 --> 34:07.050
very interesting to hear what
she has to say about you,

34:07.118 --> 34:08.851
her loyal protégé.

34:08.920 --> 34:11.922
This line of questioning is now over.

34:11.989 --> 34:13.556
Why don't you go speak to my attorney.

34:13.623 --> 34:16.393
He's two doors down.

34:16.460 --> 34:19.862
Why would you divulge
privileged information to a guy

34:19.931 --> 34:21.665
who's now clearly our lead suspect?

34:21.732 --> 34:24.568
Sorry. I'll get that
protocol thing down one day.

34:52.628 --> 34:54.139
Why aren't you dead?

34:54.163 --> 34:55.797
What? Who are you?

34:55.864 --> 34:57.065
Don't give me that, Charlotte.

34:57.099 --> 34:58.600
By the way, thanks for using

34:58.668 --> 35:01.041
the credit card we opened
for the Perez case.

35:01.042 --> 35:03.090
Did you forget I'm the only
one that has access to it?

35:03.114 --> 35:04.348
That I'm the only one

35:04.416 --> 35:06.483
who did anything for you
at that hellhole?

35:06.551 --> 35:09.153
Hellhole? Are you a demon, too?

35:09.220 --> 35:10.320
Why?

35:10.388 --> 35:11.889
Because I'm a little upset?

35:11.956 --> 35:14.491
Wouldn't you be, too,
if you got passed up by Wheeler

35:14.559 --> 35:16.193
with the big wiener?

35:16.261 --> 35:18.629
Oh, I know who you are now.
You're the one who killed me.

35:18.697 --> 35:20.431
Well, apparently not. But I am now.

35:20.498 --> 35:22.433
Sorry.

35:22.500 --> 35:24.568
- Can't kill my mum.
- Oh!

35:24.636 --> 35:25.703
Lucifer!

35:25.770 --> 35:26.837
Detective.

35:26.905 --> 35:28.906
If you're gonna follow me following him,

35:28.973 --> 35:30.908
we should have just drove together.

35:33.244 --> 35:35.779
Right, you get him, Detective!

35:35.847 --> 35:38.315
I'll stay here and protect the poor lady!

35:38.383 --> 35:40.284
Protect me? From what?

35:40.655 --> 35:42.453
Ow!

35:42.520 --> 35:43.854
What'd you do that for?

35:43.922 --> 35:45.658
Well, the detective knows
you're alive now,

35:45.659 --> 35:47.668
so you're gonna have to sell
the whole Charlotte charade.

35:47.692 --> 35:49.593
Need to explain that blood pool somehow.

35:49.661 --> 35:51.862
- Oh, you little...
- Devil?

35:51.930 --> 35:53.731
Yes. But about that...

35:53.798 --> 35:56.333
we've never met until now,
don't know each other.

35:56.401 --> 35:59.436
I fear it's too much for
the detective to handle.

36:01.606 --> 36:05.142
Well, it looks like she
can handle quite a bit.

36:05.210 --> 36:06.313
Yeah.

36:17.088 --> 36:20.157
Well, it seems that wound was
re-aggravated in all the hubbub.

36:20.225 --> 36:21.525
Poor woman.

36:21.593 --> 36:23.761
You want to tell me what
the hell you were doing?

36:23.828 --> 36:25.706
Well, leading the mouse
to the cheese, of course.

36:25.730 --> 36:27.231
I mean, I was gonna be the cat,

36:27.298 --> 36:31.301
but then you showed up, so
I suppose that makes you the dog.

36:31.369 --> 36:32.720
What am I gonna do with you?

36:32.722 --> 36:34.571
Well, I can think of a few things.

36:34.639 --> 36:36.173
Might need a stretch first though.

36:36.241 --> 36:37.708
You need to follow the rules.

36:37.776 --> 36:39.910
You tell me not to ravage
suspects in front of you.

36:39.978 --> 36:41.845
Now I can't do it behind your back either?

36:41.913 --> 36:44.047
I mean, make your mind up, Detective.

36:44.115 --> 36:45.849
No more buying my daughter $200 dolls.

36:45.917 --> 36:48.218
Well, why not? You weren't going to.

36:48.286 --> 36:50.888
I was teaching her a lesson.

36:50.955 --> 36:53.056
Neglect 101. You're abandoning her

36:53.124 --> 36:54.725
in her time of need, Detective.

37:00.165 --> 37:03.867
I don't know what happened
between you and your mother.

37:03.935 --> 37:06.904
And if you ever want to talk
about it, I'm here for you.

37:06.971 --> 37:08.138
But listen to me.

37:08.206 --> 37:09.640
Doing what's best for your child...

37:09.707 --> 37:13.343
it doesn't always make 'em happy.

37:23.888 --> 37:27.958
I hate to interrupt so late, but, uh...

37:28.026 --> 37:30.160
I just wanted to apologize.

37:30.228 --> 37:31.361
Oh?

37:31.429 --> 37:33.297
Yeah, you were right, Linda.

37:33.364 --> 37:36.700
You see, I really do have
a lot to atone for.

37:36.768 --> 37:41.238
I've... made so many mistakes lately.

37:41.306 --> 37:43.173
But a big one was hurting you.

37:43.241 --> 37:45.175
I may have forged a friendship with you

37:45.243 --> 37:47.544
under false pretenses, yes.

37:47.612 --> 37:51.548
But I did consider you a friend.

37:51.616 --> 37:54.351
And I'm deeply sorry that I ruined that.

37:57.455 --> 38:00.924
If anyone understands mistakes,
it's a therapist.

38:00.992 --> 38:03.961
Not that you'd know.

38:07.232 --> 38:08.866
Apology accepted.

38:10.235 --> 38:11.802
Thank you.

38:11.870 --> 38:13.737
Night.

38:13.805 --> 38:15.739
Good night.

39:30.448 --> 39:32.382
What on earth is that?

39:32.450 --> 39:33.984
Cheesy noodles.

39:34.052 --> 39:37.621
It's what mothers make to
bring their children joy.

39:38.589 --> 39:41.458
I saw it on the flat-screen.

39:44.329 --> 39:45.929
That explains all the cheese.

39:50.401 --> 39:52.269
Lucifer...

39:52.337 --> 39:55.806
I wish, with all my being,

39:55.873 --> 39:59.142
that things could go back
to the way things were.

39:59.210 --> 40:01.745
With you...

40:01.813 --> 40:04.915
and all my children again in Heaven.

40:08.019 --> 40:11.888
I want what your father took from me.

40:11.956 --> 40:14.725
I want my home back.

40:19.197 --> 40:22.966
But I know that's not possible.

40:23.034 --> 40:25.569
So I want to do what I can

40:25.636 --> 40:30.807
to be a good mother to
you here, on Earth.

40:39.317 --> 40:41.351
It's too late.

40:43.554 --> 40:45.989
You abandoned me, Mum.

40:46.057 --> 40:50.193
You just stood by and
watched as I was cast out.

40:50.261 --> 40:54.364
Thrown into Hell and
vilified for all eternity.

40:56.034 --> 40:58.702
There aren't enough cheesy
noodles in the universe

40:58.770 --> 41:00.904
to fix all that, I'm afraid.

41:05.676 --> 41:07.444
Okay.

41:19.824 --> 41:21.958
Your father never sent you to Hell.

41:24.062 --> 41:26.863
I did.

41:26.931 --> 41:29.399
Oh, great. Much better.

41:30.635 --> 41:33.336
I did it to save your life.

41:33.404 --> 41:37.874
After the rebellion, your
father was angry.

41:37.942 --> 41:40.477
Deeply angry.

41:43.815 --> 41:46.583
He wanted to destroy you.

41:46.651 --> 41:50.087
I begged him not to.

41:50.154 --> 41:54.724
I asked him to send you to Hell instead.

41:55.760 --> 41:59.629
I did it because I love you, son.

42:00.631 --> 42:03.533
And I always will.

42:03.601 --> 42:06.436
However...

42:06.504 --> 42:09.106
if you still need me

42:09.173 --> 42:12.008
to return me to Hell, I understand.

42:13.778 --> 42:16.046
You do what is right for you.

42:18.249 --> 42:20.050
That's very gracious of you, Mother.

42:21.419 --> 42:23.553
Okay, but please don't
send me back to Hell.

42:27.658 --> 42:30.694
But I meant the rest.

42:32.530 --> 42:34.931
I know you did.

42:36.601 --> 42:38.135
All right.

42:38.202 --> 42:39.836
All right, you can stay.

42:39.904 --> 42:41.671
For now.

42:41.739 --> 42:43.807
Just until I...

42:43.875 --> 42:46.309
figure out what I need to do.

42:46.377 --> 42:48.578
Thank you, son.

42:48.646 --> 42:50.347
Yeah.
