WEBVTT

00:11.052 --> 00:13.221
-What you doin'?
-I'm going to my parents.

00:13.304 --> 00:15.306
-What?
-I need to get outta here.

00:16.391 --> 00:17.475
Hey. Hey!

00:18.268 --> 00:19.269
You can't do this.

00:19.352 --> 00:22.439
I should do what you did and lie.
I'm going to the grocery store.

00:24.691 --> 00:25.817
[Colt] Hey.

00:26.401 --> 00:29.654
You can't take Peyton in the middle
of the night to your parents' house.

00:29.738 --> 00:32.574
Well, I'm not staying. And how are you
gonna take care of her, huh?

00:32.657 --> 00:34.868
You're gone at dawn,
you don't come back until after dark.

00:34.951 --> 00:37.662
I breastfeed her every two hours.
How'll that work if I leave her here?

00:38.288 --> 00:39.706
[softly] Just put her back in bed.

00:40.290 --> 00:41.291
We'll talk about this.

00:42.333 --> 00:44.919
I need some space, okay?
When I'm ready, I'll call you.

Wanna come in?

01:56.324 --> 01:58.535
I can't.
I gotta go babysit Darlene's kids.

01:59.285 --> 02:02.080
Apparently, now they're serving breakfast
at the strip club.

02:03.206 --> 02:04.040
Hmm.

02:04.207 --> 02:07.877
I don't think I'd wanna eat French toast
listening to "Welcome to the Jungle."

02:09.462 --> 02:10.922
I'll see you tonight.

02:18.847 --> 02:20.765
[gasps] Oh, shit.

02:22.016 --> 02:23.935
Oh, you scared the hell outta me, Beau.

02:25.103 --> 02:26.980
And you're still doing it.

02:30.692 --> 02:32.652
I had a call from the police station.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.947
Said you got busted for a DUI.

02:36.573 --> 02:39.033
Yeah. Not my proudest moment.

02:40.326 --> 02:42.495
To be fair, I had no idea you'd get a DUI

02:42.579 --> 02:44.247
sleeping it off in a parked car.

02:46.666 --> 02:49.002
I mean, I was in the left-turn lane,

02:49.085 --> 02:51.379
so I guess they have a bit
of a point, but still...

02:54.257 --> 02:55.675
Mary was with you.

02:58.428 --> 02:59.596
Yeah, we...

03:00.346 --> 03:01.806
We have a good time together.

03:02.640 --> 03:04.434
You're on a bad road, son.

03:05.351 --> 03:08.646
I recognize it
'cause it's the same road Rooster was on.

03:11.441 --> 03:13.151
I get it, okay?

03:13.651 --> 03:14.819
I'm pissed at myself.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.696
I just spent the night in a jail cell

03:16.779 --> 03:18.198
with a meth-head named Shaggy.

03:18.907 --> 03:20.825
Y'know, I've tried to cut you some slack,

03:20.909 --> 03:22.327
but that doesn't seem to be working.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.496
I called that counselor down at the VA.

03:25.580 --> 03:27.790
He agreed to sit down with you one-on-one.

03:29.542 --> 03:30.919
Wow, that's...

03:31.836 --> 03:32.962
That's great, thank you.

03:33.713 --> 03:34.714
Let's go.

03:35.715 --> 03:36.966
Ahh... [chuckles insincerely]

03:37.342 --> 03:38.218
Now?

03:38.301 --> 03:40.762
Yeah, he said he had time for you
first thing this morning.

03:41.346 --> 03:42.305
Ten o'clock.

03:42.889 --> 03:44.265
Fucking government hours.

03:44.933 --> 03:48.061
Probably trying to squeeze you in
before his 10:30 lunch.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.022
Look, I wanna go...

03:51.564 --> 03:53.733
but I didn't get any sleep last night.

03:53.816 --> 03:55.818
You can sleep in the truck.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.529
I'll, like, stop off
at the A&W on the way.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.782
There'll be no other stops.

04:03.201 --> 04:04.285
Let's go.

04:04.369 --> 04:05.370
Okay, uh...

04:05.453 --> 04:06.329
[laughs nervously]

04:07.747 --> 04:11.417
You're not listening to me,
and I don't love being told what to do.

04:12.418 --> 04:15.880
I want to go, I'll go,
but it's gonna be on my schedule.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.051
You're making it pretty clear
you can't be trusted.

04:20.593 --> 04:21.552
Okay.

04:22.387 --> 04:24.055
Well, let me make it real simple.

04:24.138 --> 04:25.640
I'm. Not. Going.

04:25.723 --> 04:28.142
Well, let me make this real simple.

04:28.226 --> 04:30.937
If you wanna stay here,
you're gonna take that meeting.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.858
Then maybe I shouldn't stay here.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.151
Maybe you shouldn't.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.578
[saw whirring]

04:50.748 --> 04:52.625
-[shouting over saw] What's up, Colt?
-What's up?

04:53.167 --> 04:54.168
Swung by the house.

04:54.919 --> 04:56.629
Noticed Abby was gone.

04:56.713 --> 04:59.048
She finally wise up
and leave your sorry ass?

05:03.386 --> 05:04.262
Yes.

05:06.389 --> 05:07.390
What happened?

05:08.766 --> 05:11.144
She told me she wasn't taking
that teacher job.

05:11.227 --> 05:14.981
So... I told her I hadn't
sold the herd and...

05:15.815 --> 05:17.025
everything went to shit.

05:17.608 --> 05:18.693
Sorry to hear that.

05:19.277 --> 05:21.070
Maybe she just needs a little space.

05:21.654 --> 05:22.613
Yeah.

05:23.614 --> 05:24.866
That's what she said.

05:25.658 --> 05:28.077
Look, if you want to talk about it,
I'm here.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.706
Or if you want to run some beer
through the pressure washer

05:31.789 --> 05:34.292
and spray it in each other's mouths,
I'm here for that, too.

05:34.375 --> 05:35.293
[Colt chuckles]

05:35.376 --> 05:38.629
I did that before.
I think it fucked up my taste buds.

05:38.713 --> 05:40.131
I still can't taste salty.

05:42.133 --> 05:43.426
What you been up to?

05:44.010 --> 05:45.887
Oh, man, I got a DUI last night.

05:45.970 --> 05:47.972
Oh, shit. Really?

05:48.056 --> 05:49.265
-Yeah.
-What'd you blow?

05:49.349 --> 05:50.558
Point one-two.

05:50.641 --> 05:52.769
I'm at point one-two right now.

05:55.313 --> 05:57.065
Oh, fuck!

05:57.148 --> 05:58.483
Fuck!

05:58.566 --> 05:59.650
No, I'm fucking with you.

05:59.734 --> 06:00.568
[Luke] Oh!

06:01.569 --> 06:04.739
Shit. I'm like two-point-0.
I don't even think I would've felt that.

06:06.032 --> 06:06.949
Woo!

06:07.116 --> 06:08.284
I'm gonna miss this.

06:09.452 --> 06:13.081
Your dad's pissed as hell at me.
He threw me out of the cabin, so...

06:14.248 --> 06:15.875
I'm probably gonna be taking off.

06:17.001 --> 06:18.086
You can't go.

06:19.128 --> 06:20.797
We just started hanging out.

06:20.922 --> 06:22.256
Yeah, I mean...

06:22.924 --> 06:25.968
I have plenty of work to do around here,
if you wanna hang out.

06:27.095 --> 06:28.429
Yeah, you serious?

06:29.013 --> 06:30.390
Yeah, I mean...

06:30.473 --> 06:32.266
full disclosure, I'm running out of money.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.811
Probably gonna lose the house
and the ranch,

06:34.894 --> 06:37.063
but if you want a steady job
that don't pay...

06:39.816 --> 06:43.027
Believe it or not, that's not
the worst job offer I've ever gotten.

06:45.279 --> 06:46.697
What'll you do about your herd?

06:48.199 --> 06:49.617
I'll take 'em to auction.

06:50.243 --> 06:53.663
I'll make more money if I wintered 'em,
sold 'em in the spring, but...

06:54.205 --> 06:56.541
problem is, that's like 30 grand
I ain't got.

06:58.042 --> 06:59.043
Well...

07:00.211 --> 07:02.296
you know, look, about the ranch,

07:02.380 --> 07:05.049
I know it was your dream
to run it with Rooster, but...

07:07.552 --> 07:08.886
I'd like to invest...

07:09.846 --> 07:11.013
become partners.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.184
You got that kind of money?

07:18.187 --> 07:19.772
You can't tell anyone about this.

07:20.565 --> 07:21.566
Back in Iraq...

07:22.358 --> 07:25.486
a guy with light skin and blue eyes
can make a lot of cash...

07:26.737 --> 07:29.198
letting people watch him
do certain things.

07:34.162 --> 07:35.580
I'm fuckin' with you, man.

07:35.663 --> 07:37.248
-Oh, shit!
-Yeah.

07:38.833 --> 07:41.169
My mom left me some money when she died.

07:42.795 --> 07:44.797
I just can't believe you'd do this for me.

07:46.007 --> 07:48.301
This is like... This is huge.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.137
Hey, pal, come on.

07:51.220 --> 07:53.806
A couple seconds ago
I was thinkin' about goin' to Iraq

07:53.890 --> 07:55.641
and doin' some weird shit for money, man.

07:58.936 --> 08:02.315
A guy like you,
looks like Cindy Crawford...

08:05.401 --> 08:07.737
porcelain skin,
those eyes you fall backwards into,

08:07.820 --> 08:09.864
I bet you could make
some good money over there.

08:12.074 --> 08:13.701
I thought you said you was jokin'.

08:13.784 --> 08:15.703
Yeah. Yeah, I was.

08:16.412 --> 08:17.580
Unless you're serious.

08:20.041 --> 08:21.209
Then I was not.

08:26.964 --> 08:28.508
[Joanne] Anyone else joining us?

08:28.591 --> 08:29.509
[Beau] Nope.

08:30.009 --> 08:31.427
Just the usual four.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.888
You, me, Pat, and Vanna.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.975
How'd things go with your insurance guy?

08:38.059 --> 08:40.686
He finally decided
to cut me a check for my house.

08:41.354 --> 08:44.524
The fire inspector determined
the reason it was a pile of ashes

08:44.607 --> 08:45.608
was "fire."

08:47.360 --> 08:49.987
-That's great. I'm happy for you.
-Mm-hm.

08:51.280 --> 08:54.242
[Beau] I'm sure they won't take
nearly that long to raise your rates.

08:55.284 --> 08:57.912
We're still going back and forth
about some of my valuables.

08:57.995 --> 09:00.206
When they tell you to take a picture
of everything you own

09:00.540 --> 09:03.000
they don't tell you <i>not</i> to leave
the camera in the house.

09:05.711 --> 09:09.549
And they've offered to set me up with
a contractor to rebuild my house, but...

09:09.632 --> 09:11.551
I'm not sure if I should do that.

09:12.301 --> 09:16.305
Well, if you're thinking about using Colt,
I'd spend the money on a professional.

09:17.431 --> 09:19.350
He's barely out of the framing stage

09:19.433 --> 09:21.686
and he's already got a step
that he recommends

09:21.769 --> 09:23.980
you don't put your full weight on.

09:26.107 --> 09:29.026
No, I was wondering
if I should rebuild at all.

09:29.610 --> 09:32.196
I don't want to spend the time
and the money to rebuild a house

09:32.280 --> 09:34.073
I'm hardly ever gonna be at.

09:35.616 --> 09:36.450
Oh.

09:37.743 --> 09:38.619
I see.

09:38.703 --> 09:39.537
[Joanne] Hmm.

09:41.622 --> 09:43.207
Yeah, it's a lot to think about.

09:43.291 --> 09:46.377
All of a sudden, I have to figure out
where I'm gonna be living in six months.

09:46.460 --> 09:48.254
Well, I'm glad you brought it up.

09:49.046 --> 09:52.592
You know, everything going on, I guess
I haven't thought that far ahead.

09:52.675 --> 09:53.843
Me neither.

09:53.926 --> 09:57.096
But the good thing is, I don't have to
let 'em know for a couple of days, so...

09:57.179 --> 09:58.723
we can both just think about it.

09:59.098 --> 10:00.182
Yeah.

10:00.474 --> 10:03.102
It's the right thing to do.
We'll think about it.

10:04.228 --> 10:07.106
And the good thing is, at our age,
maybe one of us will drop dead

10:07.189 --> 10:08.733
-before we have to figure it out.
-Hmm.

10:09.734 --> 10:10.943
All right, let's eat.

10:11.944 --> 10:13.154
Yeah.

10:13.237 --> 10:14.322
Thanks.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.454
You know I love having you here, right?

10:22.663 --> 10:24.582
Of course. I love it, too.

10:25.958 --> 10:27.001
Good.

10:31.005 --> 10:32.840
-You gotta be kiddin' me.
-What?

10:36.177 --> 10:38.220
A piece of fuckin' pineapple.

10:45.186 --> 10:46.062
[vehicle approaches]

10:53.527 --> 10:54.654
Hey.

10:56.364 --> 10:57.448
Did you buy a minivan?

10:58.699 --> 10:59.742
Sure did.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.162
Like that, Peyton?

11:04.121 --> 11:06.582
It's got room for 12 cups and no boys.

11:09.585 --> 11:10.419
Can I--

11:12.838 --> 11:13.714
Here.

11:25.267 --> 11:26.310
[gently] Missed you.

11:29.146 --> 11:30.731
Where'd you get the money for that?

11:34.235 --> 11:35.361
I, uh..

11:37.321 --> 11:38.531
traded in the Bronco

11:39.323 --> 11:40.574
as a down payment.

11:41.826 --> 11:44.078
My old center, Josh,
gave me a good deal on it.

11:44.995 --> 11:47.498
You believe they pulled that thing
out of a lake?

11:50.000 --> 11:52.920
It's really sweet,
but I said I needed some time, so...

11:53.003 --> 11:54.755
Yeah, no, I know, it's...

11:55.339 --> 11:57.883
I know this won't fix everything.

12:00.052 --> 12:02.972
Actually, I came here to communicate...

12:04.223 --> 12:05.391
that...

12:05.975 --> 12:06.976
things have changed.

12:08.811 --> 12:12.106
Luke's gonna partner with me on the ranch
and throw in some money, so...

12:13.023 --> 12:15.401
you don't have to take
that teaching job in Norwood.

12:15.484 --> 12:17.987
You took on a partner in our business
without telling me?

12:20.781 --> 12:22.575
What? No.

12:22.992 --> 12:25.119
[stutters] No, I mean...

12:25.202 --> 12:26.746
-We talked about it.
-[Abby groans]

12:26.829 --> 12:30.124
It's not a done deal. That's why
I wanted to talk to you about it.

12:31.041 --> 12:33.085
If you don't want to do it,
we don't have to.

12:33.169 --> 12:34.795
Let's talk about it.

12:37.882 --> 12:39.091
What were you thinking

12:40.009 --> 12:41.927
at the Golden Corral last night?

12:43.512 --> 12:45.765
We could convince them we were 12
and eat for free.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.937
We were sitting there together
having a great time.

12:53.981 --> 12:56.192
Laughing, celebrating,

12:56.859 --> 12:59.278
toasting to my new job.

13:00.070 --> 13:01.447
And the whole time...

13:02.198 --> 13:04.742
you knew you were lying to my face.

13:06.535 --> 13:07.995
Why would you do that?

13:12.500 --> 13:13.542
I thought I could fix it.

13:15.127 --> 13:16.879
I didn't want you to be upset.

13:18.339 --> 13:20.633
Do you know what
the most disturbing part about it is?

13:22.760 --> 13:25.137
How you did it so well.

13:27.473 --> 13:31.268
God, I had no fuckin' idea
what was happening.

13:36.398 --> 13:37.775
I feel awful.

13:37.858 --> 13:39.235
-No.
-I'm sorry.

13:39.318 --> 13:40.528
Yep.

13:41.111 --> 13:42.947
That's the thing, Colt.
You always feel bad,

13:43.030 --> 13:44.448
you always feel sorry.

13:45.574 --> 13:48.702
Like when you took money
from my parents without telling me

13:48.786 --> 13:51.288
or how you got the Peterson Ranch
behind everyone's back

13:51.372 --> 13:54.250
or how you slept with Heather
and didn't tell me until I caught you.

13:54.333 --> 13:55.376
I could keep going.

13:55.709 --> 13:57.294
Just tell me what I need to do to fix it.

13:57.378 --> 14:00.130
Just give me some space,
like I asked you to yesterday.

14:01.090 --> 14:03.050
-That's it.
-Hey.

14:04.510 --> 14:05.803
I'm done holding her?

14:07.137 --> 14:08.514
She's got two parents, you know.

14:08.597 --> 14:10.099
I'm not trying to take her from you.

14:10.182 --> 14:11.851
I need to feed her, so, sorry.

14:11.976 --> 14:12.977
[sniffs]

14:22.403 --> 14:23.946
Just give me some space.

14:25.990 --> 14:28.534
Abb, come on, this is stupid.

14:28.617 --> 14:31.203
Look, I'm not leaving
till we figure it out.

14:36.876 --> 14:37.960
[car door opens and shuts]

14:39.545 --> 14:41.088
Well, look at you,

14:41.171 --> 14:43.549
sitting on your porch,
cleaning your shotgun.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.511
It's like a cover
of <i>Get Off My Lawn</i> magazine.

14:50.764 --> 14:54.226
Well, I must not be doing it right
'cause you're still standing here.

14:54.935 --> 14:56.896
Just brought by your check for the herd.

14:58.814 --> 15:01.233
I'd say that it's been a pleasure
doing business with you,

15:01.317 --> 15:03.694
but we both know that's a lie.

15:03.777 --> 15:05.487
I got paid for doin' nothing.

15:06.238 --> 15:09.325
This must be what it feels like
to be a liberal every day.

15:13.954 --> 15:16.582
You know, there's no reason
why Iron River

15:16.665 --> 15:19.627
couldn't become part
of the Neumann Hill family permanently.

15:20.210 --> 15:24.006
You'd still own the ranch
and my men could help you from day one.

15:25.299 --> 15:27.301
I can't believe I'm saying this, but...

15:28.552 --> 15:30.596
why don't you write up a proposal

15:31.597 --> 15:32.598
and I'll look at it?

15:33.182 --> 15:34.058
Wow.

15:35.768 --> 15:36.852
Yeah, I can do that.

15:39.021 --> 15:41.565
Who the hell do you know
who owns a minivan?

15:42.316 --> 15:44.860
I don't know anybody
that owns a mini-anything.

15:50.199 --> 15:51.784
You got a minivan?

15:53.118 --> 15:56.163
It's a Freestar, part of the Ford family.

15:56.246 --> 15:58.624
You're the Freestar of the Bennett family.

15:59.833 --> 16:01.293
Well, Colt, I like it.

16:02.252 --> 16:05.255
You and the other moms
can sit on the tailgate at soccer games

16:05.339 --> 16:07.174
and eat orange slices.

16:09.009 --> 16:11.929
And it's badass. Somebody died in it.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.101
What's she doin' here?

16:17.518 --> 16:19.478
She stopped by to give me a check.

16:20.729 --> 16:22.356
And she offered to make this...

16:23.357 --> 16:24.483
a permanent deal.

16:27.236 --> 16:30.364
-You're not considering it, are you?
-I don't know.

16:31.448 --> 16:32.449
Maybe it's time.

16:33.951 --> 16:35.077
Jesus.

16:36.954 --> 16:38.247
Is everyone going crazy?

16:39.248 --> 16:40.916
This is what Lisa Neumann does.

16:41.458 --> 16:43.210
She dangles a sweet deal in front of you,

16:43.293 --> 16:46.380
then tries to buy your ranch.
She tried to pull the same shit with me.

16:46.463 --> 16:50.509
Don't blame Lisa Neumann for
your stupidity in turning down her deal.

16:52.094 --> 16:54.430
You put yourself into the hole you're in.

16:56.473 --> 16:57.349
I'm stupid?

17:05.315 --> 17:08.402
You know this is the same deal
that Ed offered us last year?

17:08.485 --> 17:11.822
You told me and Rooster that
we were idiots for even considering it.

17:12.614 --> 17:15.701
So what, you just changed your mind?

17:15.784 --> 17:18.203
What do you want me to say?
That I was wrong?

17:19.204 --> 17:20.372
I was wrong.

17:21.498 --> 17:22.624
You were wrong?

17:24.168 --> 17:26.295
What the fuck is going on here?

17:27.588 --> 17:28.672
[stutters]

17:28.756 --> 17:32.468
You're gonna put Neumann's Hill brand
on your cattle?

17:32.551 --> 17:33.927
That's right.

17:34.011 --> 17:35.304
They <i>are</i> my cows.

17:36.180 --> 17:38.682
They've been my cows
for the last 50 years.

17:39.183 --> 17:41.477
I've earned the right to do anything
I wanna <i>fuckin' </i>do.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.312
You always told me and Rooster...

17:43.395 --> 17:46.857
that Iron River is the most
important thing in this family.

17:46.940 --> 17:49.193
"Our brand is our legacy!"

17:50.778 --> 17:51.945
A week ago,

17:52.362 --> 17:53.947
I asked for your help

17:54.531 --> 17:57.534
to put that brand on <i>my</i> cattle,
to help me to help my family.

17:58.368 --> 18:00.370
But it was just too fuckin' precious.

18:02.039 --> 18:03.457
But if the money's right...

18:05.000 --> 18:06.251
that's all that matters.

18:07.086 --> 18:07.961
Right, Dad?

18:20.682 --> 18:22.559
-God, look at you.
-[Peyton gurgles]

18:22.643 --> 18:24.186
Gettin' bigger every day.

18:25.020 --> 18:27.564
Hey, I got something for you.

18:35.656 --> 18:37.658
Your dad is gonna be so jealous.

18:38.283 --> 18:39.576
He can't grow one.

18:47.417 --> 18:49.419
[chuckling] Aw!

18:50.045 --> 18:50.921
Look at you.

18:51.004 --> 18:52.798
You look just like your Pop Pop.

18:54.466 --> 18:56.593
Or my mom when she runs outta bleach.

18:57.928 --> 18:59.138
We're gonna get goin'.

18:59.221 --> 19:00.264
Where you headed?

19:01.056 --> 19:02.057
Colt didn't tell ya?

19:02.141 --> 19:03.892
Well, he may have.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.270
I try not to listen when he talks.

19:10.190 --> 19:13.193
Peyton and I,
we're staying at my parents' right now.

19:13.277 --> 19:14.528
Oh, no.

19:15.946 --> 19:17.114
I'm sorry to hear that.

19:19.658 --> 19:21.869
Does it have anything to do
with this cattle deal?

19:22.703 --> 19:23.871
Sort of.

19:23.954 --> 19:25.455
It's a lot to get into.

19:26.874 --> 19:28.333
We had a fight, so...

19:29.042 --> 19:30.460
[Beau] I'll tell you this...

19:32.087 --> 19:33.797
Colt loves you more than anything.

19:35.132 --> 19:36.049
His whole life,

19:36.133 --> 19:39.094
it was always football and video games.

19:40.387 --> 19:43.307
Then one day he spent two hours
fixing his hair.

19:46.643 --> 19:49.188
He told me it was for a girl named Abby.

19:49.938 --> 19:50.772
Oh.

19:51.440 --> 19:54.276
Never realized I was the reason
why he was so obsessed with his hair.

19:58.405 --> 20:00.866
It's the one thing I don't like about you.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.164
Look, I know how hard it is to...

20:08.207 --> 20:10.709
put all your energy into a cattle ranch,

20:11.543 --> 20:12.544
not have anything left

20:12.628 --> 20:13.962
for a relationship.

20:15.839 --> 20:17.883
Well, it cost me a marriage.

20:18.592 --> 20:20.636
Hell, I'm still trying
to find that balance.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.387
I know, I get it.

20:22.471 --> 20:25.974
I know that's what I signed up for when
I married him but I don't know what to do.

20:26.850 --> 20:29.228
The one thing I know for sure...

20:29.311 --> 20:31.021
if you and Colt aren't right...

20:32.231 --> 20:33.523
it's not good for Peyton.

20:37.152 --> 20:38.654
She's the thing you gotta think of.

20:39.988 --> 20:41.782
Yeah. No, you're right. Hmm.

20:43.367 --> 20:44.952
I gotta look out for her first.

20:46.036 --> 20:48.997
She's already gonna get made fun
of in preschool for this mustache.

20:54.795 --> 20:56.046
I know I did.

21:04.346 --> 21:05.681
Know what I like about you, Hank?

21:06.807 --> 21:07.891
My eyes?

21:11.186 --> 21:12.229
You're consistent.

21:13.188 --> 21:15.399
You don't do things one way for 70 years,

21:15.482 --> 21:17.776
then suddenly go against everything
you stand for.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.737
I've been coming here
since I was 13 years old,

21:20.821 --> 21:24.074
and you're always sitting
in that stool, drinking a beer.

21:24.866 --> 21:25.784
Here you go.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.914
What the actual fuck?

21:34.334 --> 21:35.627
It's wine night.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.337
Two for one.

21:39.715 --> 21:41.967
I guess I'm drinking
classy tonight. Maria?

21:42.050 --> 21:43.677
I'll take two wine and cokes.

21:47.306 --> 21:48.223
Hey.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.266
Hey.

21:49.933 --> 21:50.976
How'd it go with Abby?

21:52.060 --> 21:53.020
Not great.

21:53.812 --> 21:54.896
I bought her a minivan.

21:55.605 --> 21:58.734
Thought it'd make her happy.
I mean, a guy died in it.

22:00.152 --> 22:02.779
What happened? He kill himself
'cause he owned a minivan?

22:04.740 --> 22:06.283
I've got something for ya.

22:07.117 --> 22:08.452
It's the keys to the ranch.

22:08.535 --> 22:10.579
This one's for the tractor.

22:10.662 --> 22:12.622
This is the storage bin.

22:13.206 --> 22:16.084
This guy here,
this is just a letter opener.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.669
It'll start the ATV, though.

22:18.795 --> 22:19.713
Wow.

22:20.630 --> 22:22.507
Well, thank you.

22:22.591 --> 22:24.384
I wish I had something to give you.

22:25.218 --> 22:26.762
Oh, wait, I'm giving you money.

22:29.014 --> 22:31.433
Just spent 30 grand on two keys
and a letter opener.

22:33.226 --> 22:34.478
Oh, thank you.

22:34.561 --> 22:37.189
We're having
a little company picnic later.

22:38.190 --> 22:41.026
It's basically just me slamming beers
and grilling up hot dogs,

22:41.109 --> 22:42.569
but you wanna come?

22:42.652 --> 22:43.779
Sounds great.

22:45.405 --> 22:47.032
Hey, Colt. Who's your friend?

22:48.033 --> 22:51.536
Looks like a member of the white trash
Backstreet Boys. [chuckles]

22:52.996 --> 22:54.247
Compliment accepted.

22:54.331 --> 22:55.165
[Mary chuckles]

22:56.750 --> 22:58.627
You got a lotta balls comin' in here.

22:58.710 --> 22:59.586
What?

22:59.878 --> 23:01.338
My ma told me what happened.

23:02.547 --> 23:03.548
You stole from her...

23:04.341 --> 23:05.592
to buy drugs.

23:06.301 --> 23:07.969
Then you got Maria fired.

23:08.553 --> 23:10.597
Not to mention what you did
with my brother.

23:11.556 --> 23:12.974
I loved your brother.

23:14.309 --> 23:17.187
And your mom is a fuckin' liar.

23:17.270 --> 23:18.188
That's...

23:18.772 --> 23:19.606
[Colt clears throat]

23:19.689 --> 23:21.149
You need to get the fuck outta here.

23:21.733 --> 23:23.652
Okay, hey, let's calm down.

23:23.735 --> 23:26.738
No, you don't call my mom a liar
and sit down in her bar and drink.

23:26.822 --> 23:27.823
I'm just gonna go.

23:27.906 --> 23:29.741
No, no, no, no, you stay.

23:29.825 --> 23:32.202
Look, you're gonna find out
sooner or later.

23:32.285 --> 23:33.620
Mary and I are hanging out.

23:36.540 --> 23:37.833
You guys are hooking up?

23:38.834 --> 23:39.793
Fuck that.

23:40.335 --> 23:41.336
That ain't happenin'.

23:41.420 --> 23:46.007
Okay, I realize you guys got history,
but you can't tell her what to do

23:46.091 --> 23:48.093
and you definitely can't tell me
what to do.

23:52.013 --> 23:53.807
I'm offering you a chance

23:53.890 --> 23:55.434
to be a part of this family.

23:56.518 --> 23:58.145
Don't fuck it up 'cause of her.

24:00.313 --> 24:02.649
Okay, it's like that? How about this?

24:02.732 --> 24:05.485
Don't tell me how to live my life,
I won't tell you how to live yours.

24:05.569 --> 24:07.821
Okay, you know what? Let's just...
He's not worth it.

24:07.904 --> 24:09.698
-Let's just go somewhere else.
-No, no.

24:11.366 --> 24:12.492
I don't give a shit.

24:15.120 --> 24:16.496
Sit down, have a drink.

24:17.789 --> 24:19.332
She's gonna fuck your life up.

24:24.796 --> 24:27.757
This always happens on wine night.

24:33.847 --> 24:34.764
[door opens]

24:36.766 --> 24:37.642
Hey.

24:38.351 --> 24:39.227
Whatcha got there?

24:40.061 --> 24:42.481
Stopped off at Starbucks
for a Frappuccino.

24:43.315 --> 24:47.569
I'd ask you what that is, but I stopped
caring after you said "Starbucks."

24:47.652 --> 24:48.653
[Joanne chuckles[

24:50.363 --> 24:51.406
I got something for you.

24:56.703 --> 24:58.914
What? You got me a present? Huh!

24:59.289 --> 25:00.624
Why?

25:01.416 --> 25:04.127
I had a really good time
duck hunting the other day.

25:04.961 --> 25:07.172
And I want us to do more things
like that.

25:07.797 --> 25:09.132
Well, me too.

25:09.758 --> 25:12.010
Oh, that's beautiful.

25:13.220 --> 25:16.431
This gun's the last thing
a lot of small animals are gonna see.

25:18.767 --> 25:21.061
- Thank you. That was so sweet of you.
-Yeah.

25:21.811 --> 25:24.189
It got me thinking,
after the heart attack,

25:25.106 --> 25:26.816
Peyton, losing Rooster.

25:27.526 --> 25:28.652
Been a hell of a year.

25:29.819 --> 25:31.780
It's like you said, y'know,

25:32.405 --> 25:34.824
I keep telling myself
I'm gonna change but...

25:35.534 --> 25:36.826
I never really do.

25:38.453 --> 25:40.497
Well, I'm sick of not listening to myself.

25:42.207 --> 25:43.458
Well, change is hard.

25:44.167 --> 25:46.795
But part of life is embracing new things.

25:47.504 --> 25:50.840
And I think this is a good time
to tell you that I broke your VCR.

25:54.261 --> 25:55.720
I knew this day was coming.

25:56.346 --> 25:58.390
I've got seven more of them
in the basement.

26:03.395 --> 26:07.065
Lisa Neumann offered me a deal to
become part of the Neumann Hill Ranch...

26:07.691 --> 26:08.900
and I'm gonna take it.

26:09.901 --> 26:11.278
Wow. You sure about this?

26:11.361 --> 26:12.904
-Fuck, no.
-[chuckles]

26:15.323 --> 26:16.741
One more thing.

26:18.034 --> 26:20.036
I don't want you to rebuild your house.

26:20.912 --> 26:21.788
What?

26:22.789 --> 26:24.124
I love you, Joanne.

26:25.500 --> 26:27.335
I can't imagine this place without you.

26:29.087 --> 26:31.840
I want you to stay here with me
if that's what you want.

26:32.507 --> 26:34.634
I love you too, Beau.
Of course that's what I want.

26:35.468 --> 26:38.096
I just can't believe
Beau Bennett is changing.

26:39.139 --> 26:41.474
What's next?
You gonna ask to taste my Frappuccino?

26:41.558 --> 26:43.560
-[Beau chuckles]
-[Joanne chuckles]

26:44.311 --> 26:45.270
You know what?

26:45.812 --> 26:46.730
Give me that thing.

26:54.029 --> 26:57.282
Well, I know the first thing
you can shoot with your new gun.

27:02.495 --> 27:03.913
Where does Colt get off?

27:04.956 --> 27:07.208
We would never tell him
who he couldn't date.

27:07.292 --> 27:08.168
[scoffs] Right?

27:09.419 --> 27:10.462
Oh, I have.

27:11.630 --> 27:14.716
Yeah, he dated my daughter
and I shot up his truck.

27:16.843 --> 27:18.303
That's just being a great mom.

27:21.264 --> 27:22.223
I mean...

27:22.974 --> 27:24.267
fuck Colt.

27:24.351 --> 27:26.353
Where's he get off talking down to me?

27:26.436 --> 27:27.979
I'm the one loaning him money.

27:28.063 --> 27:30.065
He's supposed to be my partner,
not my boss.

27:30.148 --> 27:32.275
I don't care how fucking
good-looking he is.

27:38.948 --> 27:40.867
His mom was not any better,
I'm telling you.

27:40.950 --> 27:45.830
She pried her lips off the bong
just long enough to call me a drug addict.

27:48.375 --> 27:50.377
I think she called me a drug...
I don't know.

27:50.460 --> 27:52.253
I was so fucking high at the time.

27:55.715 --> 27:57.050
How about Beau?

27:57.717 --> 28:00.887
That guy's always telling me I need help.
He's got anger management issues.

28:02.263 --> 28:04.140
We went down to Outback Steakhouse.

28:04.224 --> 28:06.476
They had the nerve
to cook that steak medium.

28:06.559 --> 28:09.270
Pulled the chef out of the kitchen,
made him apologize to the meat.

28:09.354 --> 28:10.271
[sniggers]

28:13.191 --> 28:15.819
God, and Colt, is he so high and mighty?

28:15.902 --> 28:18.488
You know, he busted up
Abby's engagement to date her.

28:20.031 --> 28:23.159
That whole family, they love to point out
other people's problems,

28:23.243 --> 28:25.078
just so they don't have to
deal with their own.

28:26.162 --> 28:28.498
They're like the fuckin'
redneck Kardashians.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.253
Fuck the Bennetts, y'know?

28:35.797 --> 28:37.048
Ever been to California?

28:37.507 --> 28:38.425
I wish.

28:39.008 --> 28:41.720
That's where I was heading
before I stopped here.

28:43.930 --> 28:45.140
We could go there.

28:45.515 --> 28:47.434
[chuckles] You're funny.

28:48.059 --> 28:49.394
No, I'm serious.

28:50.228 --> 28:51.521
We can leave right now.

28:55.316 --> 28:58.027
I can't. I mean, I gotta get a job.

28:58.111 --> 28:59.696
I've gotta pay my creditors.

28:59.779 --> 29:03.158
I've got two grown daughters
and their kids living in my house.

29:06.327 --> 29:07.996
I can be packed in five minutes.

29:09.038 --> 29:11.332
Girl, I live in my truck,
I'm already packed.

29:15.003 --> 29:16.254
Are we seriously doing this?

29:17.172 --> 29:18.256
We're doing this.

29:19.257 --> 29:20.216
All right,

29:20.300 --> 29:22.761
California, here we come!

29:43.990 --> 29:45.992
[vehicle approaches]

29:55.835 --> 29:56.836
Hi.

29:59.422 --> 30:00.423
Hey.

30:03.092 --> 30:03.968
What's goin' on?

30:06.971 --> 30:07.931
Can we talk?

30:10.809 --> 30:11.768
Let's dance.

30:15.063 --> 30:15.897
[Abby clears throat]

30:18.066 --> 30:18.900
[sighs]

30:21.194 --> 30:22.904
I was gonna do some big gesture.

30:24.197 --> 30:25.573
I was thinkin' about...

30:27.408 --> 30:29.911
finishing Peyton's nursery at the house.

30:31.496 --> 30:33.706
Like, getting a DQ Blizzard
named after you.

30:36.584 --> 30:39.003
You know, I called the corporate office.

30:39.629 --> 30:43.091
It ain't gonna happen unless you change
your name to Turtle Pecan Clusters.

30:48.221 --> 30:49.264
I'm sorry.

30:53.226 --> 30:54.269
I was an idiot.

30:56.646 --> 30:57.981
I shoulda talked to you.

31:02.360 --> 31:05.029
Last couple of days
have been miserable without you.

31:07.073 --> 31:07.991
Yeah.

31:08.825 --> 31:09.826
It's been hard.

31:11.703 --> 31:12.537
[sighs]

31:15.081 --> 31:18.084
I know a big gesture ain't gonna fix this.

31:20.837 --> 31:22.672
You need me to be honest with you.

31:24.424 --> 31:25.300
And I will.

31:27.218 --> 31:28.052
I'm sorry.

31:29.888 --> 31:30.847
I love you.

31:32.807 --> 31:34.309
I love you, too, Colt.

31:36.936 --> 31:40.064
I stopped by the other day.
I was talking to your dad.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.652
He said something
that I can't get out of my head.

31:46.154 --> 31:48.948
He said that Peyton was the most
important thing in our lives...

31:50.450 --> 31:52.201
and that we should always put her first.

31:52.285 --> 31:53.536
[Colt] That's right.

31:53.620 --> 31:54.621
She's everythin'.

31:56.456 --> 31:57.874
That got me thinking.

31:59.834 --> 32:01.502
What kinda role models are we to her?

32:04.255 --> 32:07.800
It's important for her to know that her
mom and dad love each other, but...

32:09.218 --> 32:11.304
I don't want her to think
that it's okay for her dad

32:11.387 --> 32:13.222
to lie to her mom over and over again.

32:15.350 --> 32:17.185
Or for him to not treat her
like a partner.

32:19.270 --> 32:21.481
Or for him not to respect her.
It's just that...

32:22.065 --> 32:24.817
I don't want her to think that's
what a relationship should look like.

32:24.901 --> 32:25.818
It's not...

32:26.569 --> 32:30.031
I don't want that either. That's why
that ain't the way it's gonna be.

32:30.615 --> 32:31.449
[sighs]

32:34.577 --> 32:36.162
I just... I can't get...

32:37.664 --> 32:38.623
[breathes emotionally]

32:41.668 --> 32:42.502
[sniffs]

32:43.336 --> 32:44.587
[voice cracks] I can't...

32:45.505 --> 32:47.131
get over dinner the other night.

32:48.466 --> 32:49.384
[sniffles]

32:52.345 --> 32:53.429
The way you acted.

32:56.057 --> 32:56.933
What you said.

32:57.642 --> 32:58.601
You know what?

32:59.686 --> 33:02.146
If you can lie to my face,
what else are you hiding?

33:02.230 --> 33:03.648
What else don't I know?

33:04.732 --> 33:06.484
Hey, there's nothing.

33:08.987 --> 33:11.823
You know everything, I swear.

33:13.282 --> 33:14.200
Babe...

33:15.118 --> 33:16.995
you just gotta believe me.

33:20.915 --> 33:23.543
[sobbing] That's the thing. I don't.

33:27.422 --> 33:28.256
[sniffs]

33:29.173 --> 33:30.383
When I look at you...

33:31.134 --> 33:33.428
I don't see the person
that I used to see.

33:34.762 --> 33:36.347
My best friend.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.226
The guy who had my back.

33:43.855 --> 33:45.523
All I see is a liar.

33:46.983 --> 33:47.942
Abb...

33:48.693 --> 33:49.569
Abb...

33:49.902 --> 33:50.737
[sighs]

33:52.155 --> 33:53.156
[sighs deeply]

33:57.994 --> 33:59.871
I think we should separate.
