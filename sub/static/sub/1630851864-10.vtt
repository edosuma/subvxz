takes over Egypt and plots

emerging from the swamp.

Isis, put on that belt

you clip your scorpions.

04:39.319 --> 04:42.531

your goddess headdresses

towards the second platform.

04:45.409 --> 04:47.452

search for a bag
floating in the moat,

04:49.538 --> 04:52.917
containing four banners
with the names of the scorpions.

04:52.959 --> 04:56.211
Hang the banners in the
correct order by lining

04:56.254 --> 05:00.091
up the blue lines on
the top and the bottom.

05:00.132 --> 05:03.677
Then Isis must swim back
to the mud pit to find

05:03.720 --> 05:06.805
the scorpions and clip
them to your belt.

have all seven scorpions,

10:30.712 --> 10:32.340
Oh, man!

10:34.424 --> 10:36.594
-Gong it.
-[gong rings]

10:36.635 --> 10:38.136
MEREDITH: Somehow we
were second.

10:38.178 --> 10:39.639
-Second.
-How on earth

10:39.679 --> 10:41.057
-did that happen?
-CRISTELA: And the Orange

10:41.097 --> 10:43.100
Iguanas are going
to the next round.

10:43.933 --> 10:45.894
I can't
find the fricking clip!

10:46.895 --> 10:48.980
They're swimming, go!

10:52.109 --> 10:54.361
Go! Go!

10:55.403 --> 10:57.280
CRISTELA: Blue Barracudas,
the Purple Parrots--

10:57.322 --> 10:59.240
I don't know who's going
to get the last spot.

11:01.326 --> 11:02.827
This is intense.

11:02.870 --> 11:04.788
Remember,
the Purple Parrots have come in

11:04.830 --> 11:06.956
twice thinking that they
got it but they didn't get it.

11:06.999 --> 11:09.501
-[gong rings]
-Third time's a charm.

11:09.543 --> 11:12.837

-We turned into total siblings.

of our childhood--

11:16.216 --> 11:18.427
-He's not listening.
-Screaming at each other.

11:18.469 --> 11:20.053
Oh boy, we need to work on
our communication.

11:20.096 --> 11:21.971
Yes, we do.

11:22.014 --> 11:24.225
Blue Barracudas, you're
not going home empty handed.

11:24.265 --> 11:26.226
You get to keep your
Blue Barracuda T-shirts.

11:26.268 --> 11:30.648
Wear 'em with pride.
Woo! Yeah!

11:30.690 --> 11:33.734
CRISTELA: Moving on to the
next round and one step closer

11:33.775 --> 11:37.113
to the Temple Run
and $25,000 are --

11:37.153 --> 11:39.365
Orange Iguanas.
We got the Purple Parrots

11:39.407 --> 11:41.575
and we got the Green Monkeys!

11:41.616 --> 11:44.745
So now we have tested their
physical skills, but coming up

11:44.787 --> 11:47.664
their smarts with the Steps
of Knowledge right after this.

11:47.706 --> 11:49.542
Stay tuned.

11:49.582 --> 11:51.376
[cheering]

11:54.963 --> 11:57.799
CRISTELA: Welcome back to
Legends of the Hidden Temple.

11:57.841 --> 12:00.009
Oh, I love to hear it!

12:00.052 --> 12:03.221
Green Monkeys, you were
the first team across the moat.

12:03.264 --> 12:05.265
How are you feeling about
the Steps of Knowledge?

12:05.307 --> 12:06.767
It feels good.

12:06.808 --> 12:08.436
We are so excited to be here.

12:08.476 --> 12:10.479
We're ready to win
this challenge, too.

12:10.520 --> 12:12.773
Oh, okay.
Look at that!

12:13.774 --> 12:15.775
I don't have the
greatest attention span,

12:15.817 --> 12:18.403
so hopefully my brain
doesn't fail me today.

12:18.446 --> 12:21.030
CRISTELA: We saw how
fast you were crossing the moat.

12:21.072 --> 12:23.576
Now let's see how smart
you are on the Steps.

12:23.616 --> 12:26.202
Listen carefully
as Olmec tells us more

12:26.245 --> 12:29.248
of the Legend of the Seven
Scorpions of Isis.

12:30.331 --> 12:33.085
Tired and hungry, Isis emerges

12:33.126 --> 12:35.879
from the swamp disguised
as a beggar woman

12:35.921 --> 12:39.258
covered in warts with
a long, pointed nose.

12:39.299 --> 12:43.471
She, baby Horus, and her
scorpion entourage

12:43.511 --> 12:47.057
go in search of food and shelter
from the sweltering heat

12:47.099 --> 12:49.726
when they come upon the
magnificent mansion

12:49.769 --> 12:54.565
of a wealthy, noble woman
with a young child of her own.

12:54.606 --> 12:58.152
ISIS: We are tired and hungry.
May we stay the night?

12:58.193 --> 13:01.322
Perhaps
a small meal for my baby?

13:01.363 --> 13:06.159
OLMEC: The woman slams the door
in disgust so they trudge on,

13:06.201 --> 13:11.123
arriving at the modest home of a
poor woman with little to give.

13:11.164 --> 13:14.335
WOMAN: I can offer you a
simple meal and a bed of straw.

13:14.375 --> 13:17.296
I am only sorry,
I cannot provide more.

13:17.337 --> 13:19.881
Please come in.

13:19.923 --> 13:23.885
OLMEC: While Isis and the baby
finally sleep, Tefen,

13:23.927 --> 13:27.014
the leader of the
scorpions calls a meeting.

13:27.056 --> 13:30.558
TEFEN: The rich woman
could not see the nobility

13:30.600 --> 13:34.270
in a beggar and turns away
a queen?

13:34.312 --> 13:37.106
We must teach her a lesson.

13:37.149 --> 13:40.568
OLMEC: Tefen collects
venom from each scorpion.

13:40.610 --> 13:43.739
He returns to the noble woman's
mansion in the dead of night,

13:43.780 --> 13:46.533
crawls under
the door and searches,

13:46.575 --> 13:51.831
but not for the noble woman,
for her sleeping baby.

13:51.871 --> 13:53.581
MEREDITH: I definitely
relate to Isis

13:53.624 --> 13:55.584
because we are
homeless right now.

13:55.625 --> 13:57.043
We're knocking on a lot
of doors

13:57.086 --> 13:59.672
trying to get help
for some nights.

13:59.712 --> 14:02.091
CHRIS: If we actually make it
past the Steps of Knowledge, uh,

14:02.131 --> 14:04.009
hopefully,
we're getting a down payment

14:04.051 --> 14:06.928
on a house because we need that,
we're nomadic, no home.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.514
CRISTELA: These are
the Steps of Knowledge.

14:08.556 --> 14:10.182
Olmec will be asking
you questions

14:10.224 --> 14:12.183
about the legend you just heard.

14:12.225 --> 14:16.522
He'll also ask general knowledge
questions related to the story.

14:16.563 --> 14:18.941
Once he asks the questions,
stomp on

14:18.982 --> 14:20.609
the ancient
mark in front of you.

14:20.650 --> 14:23.070
If correct,
you will take a step down.

14:23.111 --> 14:26.282
If not, or if you take
too long to answer,

14:26.322 --> 14:28.241
the other
teams will have a chance.

14:28.283 --> 14:31.787
The first two teams to come down
will move on to Temple Games.

14:31.828 --> 14:35.415
The last team will be out.
Are you all ready?

14:35.456 --> 14:38.085
-[cheering]
-Alright, let's do that.

14:38.126 --> 14:40.671
Olmec, first question, please.

14:41.422 --> 14:44.799
Isis is a goddess
in what mythology?

14:44.841 --> 14:46.759
-[trilling]
-CRISTELA: Green Monkeys.

14:47.635 --> 14:49.971
-Egyptian.
-That is correct.

14:50.014 --> 14:51.807
CRISTELA: Awesome.
Take one step.

14:51.849 --> 14:54.894
Good start.
Olmec, next question.

14:54.934 --> 14:59.981
To disguise herself, Isis
transforms herself into what?

15:00.024 --> 15:01.774
-[trilling]
-CRISTELA: Orange Iguanas.

15:01.817 --> 15:03.735
A woman with warts.

15:03.777 --> 15:05.153
More info.

15:05.195 --> 15:07.114
A beggar?

15:07.155 --> 15:08.698
That is correct.

15:08.740 --> 15:10.200
Woo!

15:11.493 --> 15:13.953
CRISTELA: Alright.
Orange Iguanas, good job.

15:14.705 --> 15:16.581
Olmec. Next question.

15:16.624 --> 15:20.628
Which of these
is the largest pyramid in Egypt?

15:20.668 --> 15:22.796
-[trilling]
-CRISTELA: Orange Iguanas.

15:22.837 --> 15:24.965
The Temple of Giza?

15:25.006 --> 15:27.176
That is incorrect.

15:27.216 --> 15:29.886
-[trilling]
-CRISTELA: Green Monkeys.

15:29.928 --> 15:32.221
The Great Pyramid of Giza.

15:32.264 --> 15:33.724
That is correct.

15:33.765 --> 15:36.143
-Woo!
-CRISTELA: Oh, Green Monkeys!

15:36.894 --> 15:39.520
We messed up
the pyramid question.

15:39.562 --> 15:41.190
He was like,
"That's your fault."

15:41.606 --> 15:43.359
So I looked at him
and I was like,

15:43.399 --> 15:46.153
"Oh, you want
to get a divorce right now?"

15:46.195 --> 15:51.533
-She said that with her eyes.
-CRISTELA: Olmec. Next question.

15:51.575 --> 15:56.163
Who was the first Egyptian
to win best actor at the Oscars?

15:56.205 --> 15:58.331
-[trilling]
-CRISTELA: Purple Parrots.

15:58.374 --> 15:59.667
Rami Malek.

15:59.707 --> 16:01.250
That is correct.

16:01.293 --> 16:03.962
CRISTELA: Woo! Purple Parrots
coming up.

16:04.004 --> 16:06.923
Alright, Olmec.
What you got next?

16:06.966 --> 16:11.052
The Egyptian language is
made up of what writing system?

16:11.095 --> 16:12.679
-[trilling]
CRISTELA: Green Monkeys.

16:12.721 --> 16:14.514
-Sanskrit.
-Incorrect.

16:14.556 --> 16:15.890
-[trilling]
-CRISTELA: Orange Iguanas.

16:15.932 --> 16:18.059
-Hieroglyphics.
-That is correct.

16:18.101 --> 16:22.438
CRISTELA: Oh, wow! Oh, man.
Olmec, next question.

16:22.480 --> 16:25.109
Who turns Isis away?

16:25.149 --> 16:26.902
-[trilling]
-CRISTELA: Purple Parrots.

16:26.943 --> 16:28.236
The noblewoman.

16:28.278 --> 16:30.029
That is correct.

16:30.072 --> 16:32.573
-CRISTELA: Oh, wow.
-We all here now, baby!

16:32.615 --> 16:34.076
[Cristela laughs]

16:34.118 --> 16:35.744
CHEYENNE: We're all
neck in neck.

16:35.786 --> 16:37.413
This is so stressful.
I don't want to lose.

16:37.453 --> 16:38.746
I want to get down there.

16:38.788 --> 16:40.374
Olmec, next question.

16:40.415 --> 16:42.584
OLMEC: Scorpions
have how many legs?

16:42.625 --> 16:44.211
-[trilling]
-CRISTELA: Green Monkeys?

16:44.253 --> 16:46.337
-Eight legs.
-That is correct.

16:46.379 --> 16:47.965
CRISTELA: Oh!

16:48.006 --> 16:50.426
-[trumpet sounds]
-Congratulations,

16:50.466 --> 16:53.428
Green Monkeys, you are moving
forward to the Temple Games.

16:53.470 --> 16:56.932
-We did it!
-We're going to Temple Games!

16:57.390 --> 16:59.350
CRISTELA: We've got one
spot left and two teams.

16:59.393 --> 17:01.269
The Purple Parrots
and the Orange Iguanas.

17:01.311 --> 17:04.772
The tension is huge because
I just said the tension is huge.

17:04.815 --> 17:06.191
-Alright.
-[laughter]

17:06.232 --> 17:07.942
I am totally
terrified right now.

17:07.984 --> 17:09.653
I'm literally shaking.

17:09.694 --> 17:12.740
It's like Game seven of the
NBA playoff game--

17:12.780 --> 17:14.240
It's win or go home.

17:14.282 --> 17:16.117
Olmec.
Next question.

17:16.160 --> 17:19.704
What is the name of the
leader of the seven scorpions?

17:19.747 --> 17:21.248
-[trilling]
-CRISTELA: Orange Iguanas.

17:21.289 --> 17:22.624
Tefen.

17:25.335 --> 17:27.046
That is correct.

17:27.086 --> 17:31.340
CRISTELA: Oh! Congratulations,
Orange Iguanas.

17:31.383 --> 17:33.760
You are moving forward
to the Temple Games.

17:33.801 --> 17:35.679
We may seem like the fun,
chill, cool team

17:35.721 --> 17:38.097
but when it comes down to it,
we're going to fight.

17:38.140 --> 17:40.308
Like Tefen, we're going to do
whatever we have to

17:40.349 --> 17:43.269
to protect each other,
to get vengeance and win.

17:43.311 --> 17:44.980
Purple Parrots, I am so sorry.

17:45.021 --> 17:46.690
You played an awesome game.

17:46.731 --> 17:48.192
I hope you're
proud of what you did.

17:48.232 --> 17:49.817
It was awesome!

17:49.859 --> 17:51.487
I can't even swim so
just crossing the moat

17:51.528 --> 17:53.447
was already
very impressive to me.

17:53.489 --> 17:56.866
One answer away from
the next round--

17:56.909 --> 18:00.328
It's just, it's pretty--
It's pretty gutting.

18:00.369 --> 18:02.080
You are not
going home empty handed.

18:02.122 --> 18:04.083
Please tell them what they won.

18:04.124 --> 18:06.042
ANNOUNCER: On top of your
shirts, you're going home

18:06.085 --> 18:07.877
with a whole bunch of Legends
of the Hidden Temple

18:07.920 --> 18:09.505
-signature swag!
-Thank you--

18:09.546 --> 18:11.339
ANNOUNCER:
Including limited edition hats,

18:11.381 --> 18:13.133
beach towels,
sports chairs, spike ball sets

18:13.174 --> 18:15.676
and giant Olmec party
coolers for each of you!

18:15.719 --> 18:18.430
We have the Orange Iguanas
and the Green Monkeys.

18:18.471 --> 18:20.473
These two teams are one
step closer to racing

18:20.516 --> 18:23.102
through Olmec's Temple
for $25,000.

18:23.143 --> 18:25.311
We'll be right back.
Stay tuned.

18:29.982 --> 18:33.694
[cheering]

18:33.737 --> 18:36.115
Welcome back to the Legends
of the Hidden Temple.

18:36.155 --> 18:38.659
Now, we've seen our heroes
cross Olmec's moat

18:38.700 --> 18:41.369
and make their way down
the Steps of Knowledge.

18:41.411 --> 18:44.330
Now the glory goes to
the strongest and fastest

18:44.373 --> 18:46.458
team in the Temple Games.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.710
Still, with us,
we've got Maggie and Frank

18:48.751 --> 18:50.170
with the Green Monkeys.

18:50.211 --> 18:52.548
I am feeling
over the moon excited.

18:52.588 --> 18:54.465
It is a dream come true.

18:54.508 --> 18:56.593
And honestly,
we don't even have words for how

18:56.634 --> 18:58.302
pumped up we are to compete.

18:58.345 --> 19:01.265
And Meredith and Chris,
the Orange Iguanas.

19:01.306 --> 19:04.101
We actually had friends that
told us if we didn't make it all

19:04.143 --> 19:06.310
the way through, they weren't
going to be our friends anymore.

19:06.353 --> 19:08.396
We asked what point we
could exit and they would be

19:08.438 --> 19:09.897
happy and they said,
"No, all or nothing."

19:09.940 --> 19:11.232
So there's a lot of pressure.

19:11.275 --> 19:12.776
We'll lose a lot of friends.

19:12.817 --> 19:14.611
Both of you will be
competing

19:14.653 --> 19:17.029
for these actual
Pendants of Life.

19:17.071 --> 19:19.407
Now you will need these
to protect yourself

19:19.449 --> 19:21.701
from the dreaded Temple guards
as you make your way

19:21.742 --> 19:23.787
through Olmec's Temple.

19:23.828 --> 19:27.708
The first game will
be one team at a time.

19:27.749 --> 19:29.750
Green Monkeys,
you won the Steps of Knowledge,

19:29.792 --> 19:31.670
so you have
decided to go second.

19:31.711 --> 19:33.838
Alright, Orange Iguanas,
time to take your mark.

19:33.881 --> 19:35.632
Go ahead and get ready.

19:35.673 --> 19:37.425
Okay, Olmec will now
tell us more

19:37.467 --> 19:40.136
about Temple game number one.

19:40.179 --> 19:44.391
OLMEC: In this game,
you are Tefen collecting venom

19:44.432 --> 19:47.477
from your scorpion posse,
each one designed

19:47.519 --> 19:50.980
to attack a
different part of the body.

19:51.022 --> 19:54.984
When Cristela gives the signal,
one of you grab a scorpion,

19:55.027 --> 19:58.947
absorb as much venom as you can,
then climb atop

19:58.989 --> 20:02.867
the mountain and release
it to your team mate below,

20:02.910 --> 20:06.078
who must catch it in
that cranial funnel.

20:06.121 --> 20:08.373
Use that diagram to
direct your teammate

20:08.414 --> 20:11.585
to the first scorpion,
starting with Petet.

20:11.626 --> 20:14.962
Fill Petet's bottle without
touching it with your hands

20:15.005 --> 20:18.842
then swap roles and fill
the next Scorpion's bottle.

20:18.884 --> 20:21.970
Once all the bottles are filled,
you may hit your gong

20:22.011 --> 20:24.013
and stop the clock.

20:24.056 --> 20:27.726
The team that hits their
gong the fastest wins.

20:28.644 --> 20:31.230
Alright. Orange Iguanas,
are you ready?

20:31.270 --> 20:32.605
Yeah.

20:32.647 --> 20:35.150
Alright. Olmec, set the clock.

20:36.192 --> 20:37.486
On your mark.

20:37.527 --> 20:39.070
Get set.

20:39.112 --> 20:42.406
Go!

20:42.449 --> 20:44.617
Both scorpions up the mountain,
that doesn't leave him

20:44.660 --> 20:46.577
with a hand to pull himself up.

20:46.619 --> 20:48.288
Having to climb this
mountain with water,

20:48.329 --> 20:49.664
that's going to be difficult.

20:49.705 --> 20:50.999
MEREDITH: Chris,
how are you doing?

20:51.040 --> 20:52.584
CHRIS: I'm getting there.

20:52.625 --> 20:54.752
I think I'm going to
eat crap and like, fall.

20:54.795 --> 20:56.255
They have to
communicate here because

20:56.296 --> 20:58.089
if Meredith looks up--
Well, you get it.

20:58.131 --> 20:59.590
You-- Step out of a little bit.

20:59.633 --> 21:01.384
-The plant's in the way.
-Step out?

21:01.425 --> 21:03.679
The coordination of having
to drip and then catch.

21:03.720 --> 21:06.222
Chris has to tell Meredith which
jar to pour the venom into.

21:06.265 --> 21:10.018
Right foot, Petet.
Forward. There. You got it.

21:10.059 --> 21:11.394
Perfect, perfect, perfect.

21:11.435 --> 21:12.813
-Is it full? Okay.
-MEREDITH: Yeah.

21:12.854 --> 21:14.815
That was perfect.

21:14.855 --> 21:17.526
Now they have to swap, Meredith
squeezes and Chris catches.

21:17.567 --> 21:19.861
-Chris, how did you do this?
-CHRIS: Doing great, keep going.

21:19.903 --> 21:22.446
And then once you get up there,
just start pouring into my head.

21:22.489 --> 21:23.949
MEREDITH: Holy crap.

21:25.241 --> 21:27.118
I'm missing a lot.

21:27.160 --> 21:30.122
So I'm thinking this is
not enough, I need to get more.

21:30.163 --> 21:32.374
CHRIS: Am I full?
MEREDITH: Yeah, I think so.

21:32.415 --> 21:34.125
CHRIS: What one?
Where am I going?

21:34.166 --> 21:38.797
MEREDITH: Left hand-- Mesetet.
There you go.

21:41.008 --> 21:43.093
CHRIS: Meredith,
you have to get more water.

21:43.134 --> 21:44.927
MEREDITH: I have to go
all the way back down

21:44.970 --> 21:46.555
and go all the way back up
again.

21:46.596 --> 21:48.181
Like, this is not fun.

21:48.222 --> 21:50.642
CHRIS: We need just a
little more on that one.

21:50.683 --> 21:52.560
MEREDITH: Okay, go.

21:52.602 --> 21:54.438
I feel bad
for the kid right now.

21:55.021 --> 21:57.648
Not Chris, the actual
kid that's dying from the venom.

21:57.691 --> 22:00.109
-It's taking longer.
-CHRIS: All right. Switch.

22:00.986 --> 22:03.488
They were like losing a lot
of water out of the sponges

22:03.529 --> 22:06.199
when they were going up, so I
knew that you have to be really

22:06.240 --> 22:09.036
careful and not squeeze too
much water out on your way up.

22:09.076 --> 22:11.121
CHRIS: Last one, Mer,
we got this.

22:11.163 --> 22:13.332
MEREDITH: Masetetef.

22:13.373 --> 22:15.875
CRISTELA: Only one
more and they are done.

22:15.916 --> 22:17.919
Ah!

22:17.961 --> 22:20.505
CRISTELA: Then they have to hit
their gong to stop the clock.

22:20.547 --> 22:22.132
MEREDITH: Ah!

22:22.173 --> 22:23.884
[gong sounds]

22:23.924 --> 22:26.135
CRISTELA: Okay, Orange Iguanas
have hit the gong!

22:26.178 --> 22:29.847
They came in at seven
minutes and 24 seconds.

22:29.890 --> 22:32.808
That means that the
Green Monkeys are next

22:32.851 --> 22:34.894
and in order to get
the Pendant of Life,,

22:34.935 --> 22:36.395
they have to beat that time.

22:36.438 --> 22:38.440
So let's see if they can.

22:38.481 --> 22:40.776
The whole thing was kind of a
blur, just watching them do it.

22:40.817 --> 22:43.028
MAGGIE: I am terrified
if I'm being completely

22:43.069 --> 22:45.780
honest because we
really want to win.

22:45.822 --> 22:47.949
Alright, Green Monkeys.
Are you ready to do this?

22:47.990 --> 22:49.534
-FRANK: Yeah!
-MAGGIE: Let's go!

22:49.576 --> 22:53.372
CRISTELA: Awesome. On your mark,
get set. Go!

22:53.413 --> 22:57.917
♪♪♪

22:57.959 --> 22:59.961
Remember, the Green Monkeys have
to beat the time

23:00.002 --> 23:01.630
that the Orange Iguanas
did.

23:01.671 --> 23:03.089
That's seven
minutes and 24 seconds.

23:03.131 --> 23:04.715
Let's see
how they're going to do it.

23:04.758 --> 23:06.050
-Are you okay up there?
-FRANK: Yep.

23:06.093 --> 23:07.469
-Oh, hello.
-FRANK: Alright.

23:07.510 --> 23:09.346
MAGGIE: Oh,
this feels good.

23:09.387 --> 23:11.306
-Alright, should I go?
-FRANK: Yeah, you're good.

23:11.347 --> 23:13.141
-MAGGIE: Okay, where am I going?
-FRANK: You're going to...

23:13.182 --> 23:14.768
-MAGGIE: The symbol--
-FRANK: It's the ankh.

23:14.809 --> 23:16.603
You're going
to the far head-- Petet!

23:16.644 --> 23:18.855
CRISTELA: Frank and Maggie
have a different diagram

23:18.896 --> 23:20.731
than Chris and Meredith.

23:20.773 --> 23:22.358
MAGGIE: Okay, go.

23:22.401 --> 23:24.111
CRISTELA: It's swap time!

23:25.278 --> 23:26.779
MAGGIE: Set it down.

23:27.696 --> 23:29.657
Squeeze 'em!

23:29.699 --> 23:31.992
CRISTELA: Man, climbing
up that mountain, that's tricky.

23:32.035 --> 23:34.788
Basically they're,
they're climbing up a slide.

23:34.829 --> 23:36.998
MAGGIE: This is heavy.

23:37.039 --> 23:38.875
I think the Green Monkeys
are a strong team.

23:38.916 --> 23:41.044
Right now,
they're stressing out.

23:41.086 --> 23:43.046
And hopefully that affects
their performance.

23:43.087 --> 23:45.173
Far side arm.

23:45.214 --> 23:47.217
-Good job.
-CRISTELA: Three down.

23:47.259 --> 23:49.469
-Halfway there!
-Near side head.

23:50.010 --> 23:52.388
CRISTELA: Maggie and
Frank have only one more left.

23:52.431 --> 23:56.268
I need to go to that
Temple Run, babe!

23:56.308 --> 23:58.854
I wouldn't say I'm like,
scared or like anxious.

23:58.894 --> 24:00.689
FRANK: You're my main squeeze,
okay? Don't forget it.

24:00.730 --> 24:02.231
He won't admit it. He's shaking

24:02.273 --> 24:04.317
-on the inside, aren't you?
-No.

24:05.152 --> 24:08.613
FRANK: Oh, yeah,
let it rain. We're good.

24:08.654 --> 24:10.281
They're on their way
to fill their last one.

24:10.323 --> 24:12.284
Are they gonna make it in time?
I dunno!

24:13.492 --> 24:14.827
FRANK: Okay!

24:15.953 --> 24:17.247
[gong sounds]

24:17.288 --> 24:19.583
CRISTELA: Woo! Yes! Yes.

24:19.624 --> 24:23.252
Oh, that was amazing.
41 seconds to spare.

24:23.295 --> 24:26.506
That means Green Monkeys,
you won with time left,

24:26.548 --> 24:29.675
which means that you
get the Pendant of Life.

24:29.718 --> 24:31.928
The first one, this is awesome.

24:31.970 --> 24:34.763
We're feeling fantastic about
winning the first challenge.

24:34.806 --> 24:36.223
We're covered in mud.

24:36.266 --> 24:38.351
But it was a great time.

24:38.393 --> 24:40.895
And Orange Iguanas don't worry,
you still have a chance

24:40.936 --> 24:43.481
to redeem yourself
in Temple Game number two

24:43.522 --> 24:45.317
when we
come back after this.

24:45.357 --> 24:46.692
Stay tuned.

24:50.989 --> 24:53.074
[cheering]

24:53.115 --> 24:55.367
Welcome back to Legends of the
Hidden Temple.

24:55.410 --> 24:57.328
Congratulations, Green Monkeys.

24:57.369 --> 24:59.038
You won the Pendant of Life,.

24:59.079 --> 25:01.415
The other team are really
fierce competitors.

25:01.458 --> 25:03.792
We're kind of feeling the
heat right now because

25:03.835 --> 25:07.130
they've been married for two
years and we just got engaged.

25:07.172 --> 25:10.090
But you need two to move
on to the Temple Run.

25:10.133 --> 25:12.259
So you know, it just so
happens I have one right here,

25:12.301 --> 25:13.845
ready to go,
so it's up for grabs.

25:13.886 --> 25:15.387
Which means Orange Iguanas,

25:15.430 --> 25:17.097
you still have a chance
to tie this game.

25:17.140 --> 25:18.682
CHRIS: There's an added
element of pressure.

25:18.724 --> 25:20.519
We got to be ready for
literally anything

25:20.559 --> 25:22.436
Olmec's gonna throw at us.

25:22.479 --> 25:25.065
Our next game will actually
be both teams playing

25:25.105 --> 25:26.691
at the same time.

25:26.732 --> 25:28.567
Alright, teams go and get ready.

25:29.402 --> 25:33.114
Now Olmec will tell us more
about Temple game number two.

25:33.155 --> 25:36.076
Tefen sneaks into the
noble woman's mansion

25:36.116 --> 25:39.788
to find his target,
her sleeping baby.

25:39.828 --> 25:43.375
He rears up and delivers
his mighty sting,

25:43.415 --> 25:48.128
releasing seven doses of
deadly venom into the child.

25:48.171 --> 25:50.632
The noble woman lets
out a frantic scream

25:50.673 --> 25:53.468
that jolts Isis awake.

25:53.509 --> 25:56.387
She runs to the mansion
to discover the dying infant

25:56.429 --> 26:00.808
and immediately knows what
her scorpions have done.

26:00.849 --> 26:04.104
Transforming back into Isis,
she lays her hands

26:04.144 --> 26:07.523
on the areas affected by
the poison and chants

26:07.566 --> 26:11.528
seven healing spells
to remove each scorpion's venom.

26:11.569 --> 26:13.989
But is it too late?

26:14.029 --> 26:18.576
You must become Isis, extracting
the venom to save the child.

26:18.617 --> 26:21.788
When Cristela gives the signal,
one of you remove

26:21.829 --> 26:24.290
the cloth to reveal the
first healing spell

26:24.332 --> 26:26.917
and the name of
one of the scorpions.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.336
Chant the
spell to your teammate,

26:29.378 --> 26:32.548
who must find that scorpion's
rune and bring it

26:32.590 --> 26:36.219
to the child,
creating a healing circle.

26:36.260 --> 26:38.555
Then swap roles.

26:38.596 --> 26:41.849
When the healing circle
is complete with seven runes,

26:41.891 --> 26:44.728
remove the poison by
popping the venom sack

26:44.769 --> 26:47.105
and then you may hit your gong.

26:47.146 --> 26:50.317
The first team to
hit their gong wins.

26:50.357 --> 26:52.443
Alright, teams,
you guys ready to do this?

26:52.484 --> 26:54.028
-Yeah!
-MEREDITH: Yeah!

26:54.069 --> 26:55.572
Alright, let's do it.

26:55.614 --> 26:58.657
On your mark, get set.

26:58.700 --> 27:00.117
Go!

27:00.910 --> 27:03.329
-Our efforts will repeat--
-Over and over again

27:03.371 --> 27:04.830
-but stand by bringing--
-CHRIS: Tefen, Tefen!

27:04.873 --> 27:07.041
FRANK: Tefen!

27:07.083 --> 27:09.001
CRISTELA: The chant tells
them which scorpion rune they

27:09.044 --> 27:11.253
need then they put it in the
healing circle and swap roles.

27:11.296 --> 27:12.838
That's great.
Yep, get it out of there.

27:12.881 --> 27:14.382
FRANK: You got this.

27:14.423 --> 27:15.924
CHRIS: Come on, Mer.
You got this.

27:15.967 --> 27:17.801
MAGGIE: There's no name, blank.

27:17.844 --> 27:19.804
Sometimes you have a blank
and you have to keep going.

27:19.846 --> 27:22.222
Or sometimes you have a scorpion
name that hasn't been read yet.

27:22.265 --> 27:24.267
So you have to move on
and try to remember where

27:24.308 --> 27:26.102
that scorpion was for next time.

27:26.144 --> 27:28.313
Masetetef.

27:28.355 --> 27:30.315
CHRIS: We're going to
beat them for once in our life.

27:30.356 --> 27:31.650
-Come on, Mer. Go!
-Damn it!

27:31.691 --> 27:33.317
CHRIS: Go, go, go, go.

27:33.359 --> 27:34.986
CRISTELA: Meredith
has the first rune.

27:35.028 --> 27:36.570
-Six more to go.
-CHRIS: There you go.

27:36.613 --> 27:37.905
I'm certainly not
following this clef.

27:37.947 --> 27:39.449
Please grab Masetetef.

27:39.490 --> 27:40.825
Masetetef.

27:40.866 --> 27:42.326
-MAGGIE: Tefen!
-FRANK: Okay.

27:44.203 --> 27:46.205
I'm certainly
not following this clef.

27:46.247 --> 27:49.041
-Please grab Masetetef.
-CHRIS: Petet. That one's Petet.

27:49.084 --> 27:52.586
-MEREDITH: Masetetef. Masetetef!
-CHRIS: Go, Mer, go!

27:52.628 --> 27:56.590
This child is dripping in sweat.
Go back and fetch me Petet.

27:56.633 --> 27:58.050
Petet, Mer, Petet.

27:58.093 --> 27:59.802
MEREDITH: Oh,
bottom left, right?

27:59.844 --> 28:02.596
-CHRIS: Yeah, far left.
-MAGGIE: Masetetef, go!

28:02.638 --> 28:04.932
CRISTELA: Ooh, Green Monkeys
have their second one.

28:04.973 --> 28:08.019
Five more runes to complete
the healing circle.

28:08.060 --> 28:09.813
FRANK: This child is
dripping with sweat.

28:09.854 --> 28:13.066
-Go back and fetch me Petet!
-MAGGIE: Uh... Metet!

28:13.107 --> 28:15.234
-Is that it?
-FRANK: No, no, no. It's Petet.

28:15.276 --> 28:17.237
CHRIS: Come on Mer, go!

28:18.529 --> 28:20.240
Read me, read me!

28:20.280 --> 28:22.366
Ooh, Orange Iguanas
just took the lead.

28:22.409 --> 28:27.747
Four more runes. Uh, Tjetet is
what I need. Posthaste, I plead.

28:27.788 --> 28:29.874
CHRIS: This one is blank.

28:29.915 --> 28:32.585
Remember, if they win
this challenge, we're in a tie.

28:32.626 --> 28:35.380
FRANK: Gotta climb up, baby.

28:35.422 --> 28:37.048
-MAGGIE: What is it?
-FRANK: Petet.

28:37.089 --> 28:38.674
-MAGGIE: Tjetet.
-FRANK: Petet.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.884
-What am I looking for?
-MEREDITH: Tjetet.

28:40.926 --> 28:42.386
Blank on the top right!

28:42.429 --> 28:44.346
Tjetet, Tjetet, Tjetet.

28:45.557 --> 28:49.352
FRANK: This is a game of
patience and perseverance.

28:52.063 --> 28:53.355
Okay, come down.

28:53.397 --> 28:56.358
[indistinct]

28:56.401 --> 28:58.193
CRISTELA: Frank and Maggie
just picked up one

28:58.236 --> 28:59.863
but they're still behind.

28:59.903 --> 29:01.905
Chris and Meredith are
in the lead by two.

29:01.948 --> 29:05.451
It sounds like a threat. Go
get the protective Metet!

29:07.036 --> 29:08.538
Tjetet is what I need!

29:08.579 --> 29:09.998
Posthaste, I plead!

29:10.038 --> 29:11.833
-Head of Metet!
-Go.

29:12.875 --> 29:14.544

32:04.881 --> 32:08.134
As Isis chants with intensity,
the poison is extracted

32:08.175 --> 32:11.011
and the child revives.

32:11.054 --> 32:14.265
The noble woman offers Isis
all of her riches in return,

32:14.307 --> 32:17.644
lamenting
her earlier callousness.

32:17.684 --> 32:21.189
Isis graciously accepts
the offer, then turns the riches

32:21.230 --> 32:25.484
over to the poor woman who
sheltered them, securing Isis

32:25.526 --> 32:29.571

Egyptians for all eternity.

He grows up to defeat
his evil uncle, Set,

32:35.286 --> 32:38.873

32:41.125 --> 32:44.461
Olmec. Where are the Seven
Scorpions of Isis?

32:45.087 --> 32:47.589
OLMEC: The Seven Scorpions
of Isis may be found

and the Seven Scorpions of Isis.

32:58.183 --> 33:00.811
Before Olmec opens his gate,
he's going to give

33:00.853 --> 33:02.771
you some information
that'll help you make

33:02.814 --> 33:04.982
your way through the Temple.
Olmec.

33:06.442 --> 33:10.654
OLMEC: Your Temple Run to the
Crypt of the Heartless begins

33:10.696 --> 33:15.660
in the Crystal Cenote where only
one of three doors is unlocked.

33:15.701 --> 33:18.538
The low door directly
into the Crypt may induce

33:18.578 --> 33:21.289
some rage if locked.

33:21.332 --> 33:24.419
But choose the high door
to the Royal Rage Room

33:24.460 --> 33:28.006
and you may release that rage
on those clay pots.

33:28.047 --> 33:31.134
Find the three jade keys
to the King's Coffer

33:31.174 --> 33:35.930

to the Spider's Lair.

33:42.103 --> 33:44.646
Perhaps the Room of
the Lost Treasure.

33:44.689 --> 33:47.650
Or the Room of the Beloved.

Maneuver that lonely

to the Steamy Hollows,

34:06.461 --> 34:09.463
where you must repeat
the order of the steam blasts

34:09.505 --> 34:13.217
to open the gates to
the Queen's Armory.

34:13.259 --> 34:18.264
Dress the queen in five pieces
of magic armor and she may allow

34:18.306 --> 34:23.226
you to descend the Ladder
of Death into the Dark Forest.

34:23.268 --> 34:27.523
Or race through the door
to the Pit of Despair.

34:27.565 --> 34:31.402
Jump or climb down the
bony walls into the rubble

34:31.443 --> 34:35.947
then crawl your way to the
Crypt of the Heartless

34:35.989 --> 34:38.992
and those Seven Scorpions
of Isis.

34:39.034 --> 34:42.288
If you can grab the
scorpions before time is up,

34:42.329 --> 34:45.666
all of the doors will
instantly unlock.

34:45.708 --> 34:48.043
Race back through the
Crystal Cenote

34:48.085 --> 34:50.128

pendants as an extra life

35:27.291 --> 35:31.295
and you may go on but get
caught without a pendant

35:31.336 --> 35:33.797
you'll be taken
out of the Temple.

35:33.840 --> 35:38.885

turn to enter and try her luck.
