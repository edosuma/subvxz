[BoJack] <i>Piece of shit.</i>
<i>Stupid piece of shit.</i>

00:09.009 --> 00:13.054
<i>You're a real stupid piece of shit.</i>
<i>But I know I'm a piece of shit.</i>

00:13.138 --> 00:15.015
<i>That makes me better</i>

00:15.098 --> 00:16.516
<i>who don't know they're pieces of shit.</i>

00:16.599 --> 00:18.727
<i>Or is it worse? Breakfast.</i>

00:18.810 --> 00:20.395
<i>Oh, I don't deserve breakfast. Shut up.</i>

00:20.478 --> 00:23.231
<i>Don't feel sorry for yourself.</i>
<i>Get breakfast, you stupid fat-ass.</i>

00:24.399 --> 00:26.651
<i>These are cookies. This is not breakfast.</i>

00:26.735 --> 00:28.153
<i>You are eating cookies. Stop it.</i>

00:28.236 --> 00:30.113
<i>Stop eating cookies,</i>
<i>go make yourself breakfast.</i>

00:30.196 --> 00:31.740
<i>Stop it. Don't eat one more cookie.</i>

00:31.823 --> 00:33.450
<i>Put that down. Do not eat that cookie.</i>

00:33.533 --> 00:35.535
-[crunching]
<i>-I can't believe you ate that cookie.</i>

00:35.618 --> 00:38.079
-Hey, BoJack, we need milk.
-For the baby.

00:38.163 --> 00:39.998
-For the what?
-Where is the baby? I saw...

00:40.081 --> 00:41.458
-Can I borrow your car?
-What baby?

00:41.541 --> 00:43.251
I don't know.
Tina's gonna make breakfast.

00:43.334 --> 00:45.170
She needs milk.
Can I take the car or what?

00:45.253 --> 00:47.297
[thinking] <i>Shit.</i>
<i>I don't want her driving my car,</i>

00:47.380 --> 00:48.590
<i>getting her grubby hands all over.</i>

00:48.673 --> 00:51.009
<i>She's not grubby, she's your daughter,</i>
<i>you piece of garbage.</i>

00:51.092 --> 00:53.595
<i>You're a piece of garbage,</i>
<i>a real shitty piece of garbage.</i>

00:53.678 --> 00:54.554
Uh...

00:54.637 --> 00:57.474
<i>Think, idiot. If she takes the car,</i>
<i>you're trapped here with Mom</i>

00:57.557 --> 00:58.641
<i>and her spooky lazy eyes.</i>

00:58.725 --> 01:00.685
<i>If you get the milk</i>
<i>and leave Hollyhock with Mom,</i>

01:00.769 --> 01:02.062
<i>she could tell things about you,</i>

01:02.145 --> 01:04.064
<i>poison your daughter against you,</i>
<i>that what you want?</i>

01:04.147 --> 01:06.566
Okay, how about, um... Hold on.

01:06.649 --> 01:08.401
[thinking] <i>They're looking.</i>
<i>Say something!</i>

01:08.485 --> 01:09.569
<i>Open your idiot dumb mouth!</i>

01:09.652 --> 01:10.779
I will get milk.

01:12.072 --> 01:12.947

01:13.031 --> 01:15.200
[thinking] <i>Milk, milk.</i>
<i>What are they talking about now?</i>

01:15.283 --> 01:18.411
<i>Probably you and what a dumb piece</i>
<i>of trash you are, you fat sack of idiot.</i>

01:18.495 --> 01:20.955
<i>Why not do the world a favor</i>
<i>and swerve into oncoming traffic?</i>

01:21.414 --> 01:24.501
<i>No, you don't deserve to die young,</i>

<i>Oh, now you think you're young</i>

01:28.588 --> 01:29.422
<i>One drink.</i>

01:31.299 --> 01:32.675
<i>Whoa. Is it night suddenly?</i>

01:32.759 --> 01:33.885
<i>Suddenly sundown.</i>

01:33.968 --> 01:35.595
<i>Suddenly "Sooze-town."</i>

01:35.678 --> 01:37.472
<i>What was that show?</i>
<i>"Suddenly Sooze-town?"</i>

01:37.555 --> 01:39.182
<i>Brooke Shields... something?</i>

01:39.265 --> 01:42.519
<i>Show was on for five years and now</i>
<i>nobody-- Oh, my God, is that life?</i>

01:42.602 --> 01:45.021
<i>You're there, you do your thing,</i>
<i>and then people forget.</i>

01:45.104 --> 01:46.731
<i>"Forget it, Jake. It's Sooze-town."</i>

01:47.148 --> 01:49.484
<i>Is that me?</i>
<i>Am I the Suddenly Sooze-town of people?</i>

01:49.567 --> 01:50.568
<i>Shit.</i>

01:50.652 --> 01:51.986

-[door closes]

01:52.070 --> 01:54.197
<i>Oh, shit. You gotta drive.</i>
<i>Sober up, buddy.</i>

01:54.280 --> 01:56.783
<i>Here we go, sober... now!</i>

01:56.866 --> 01:58.284
<i>Sober, now!</i>

01:58.368 --> 02:00.870
<i>Come on, you drunk piece of shit,</i>
<i>be less drunk.</i>

02:01.412 --> 02:03.373
<i>Now! Okay.</i>

<i>Idiot. What'd you do all day?</i>
<i>Piece of shit.</i>

02:11.422 --> 02:14.801
<i>That's a day you'll never get back.</i>
<i>What was that? You're a real piece of--</i>

02:14.884 --> 02:17.387
-Where have you been?
-Uh...

02:17.470 --> 02:18.930
Did you get the milk?

02:19.013 --> 02:20.807
Uh...

02:21.933 --> 02:24.769
[theme music playing]

03:16.863 --> 03:18.656
[thinking] <i>Stupid piece of shit.</i>

03:19.782 --> 03:22.744
Oh, God. [groaning]

03:22.827 --> 03:25.872
If you're looking for the milk
Tina ended up getting,

03:25.955 --> 03:28.207
Tina is using it to make us all breakfast.

03:28.291 --> 03:29.667
[growls]

03:29.751 --> 03:32.211
Well, it's about time someone
pulls their weight around here.

03:32.295 --> 03:35.131
Henrietta, you should make
a healthy breakfast.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.675
-Okay, that's enough from you.
-For the baby.

03:39.093 --> 03:41.304
No one loves a Fatty Patty.

03:41.387 --> 03:43.640
-[groans]
-[Bea] Uh-oh.

03:45.308 --> 03:47.143
[thinking] <i>Is my house</i>
<i>on a slant or something?</i>

03:51.731 --> 03:55.026
-[Bea] This wall needs to be painted.
-I'm gonna go.

03:55.109 --> 03:57.320
You don't want to stick around,
eat breakfast together?

03:57.403 --> 03:59.614
Great pitch, love your energy.
It's a pass.

04:01.366 --> 04:02.992
[thinking] <i>What are you doing?</i>
<i>Go home.</i>

04:03.076 --> 04:06.162
<i>You're parked on Mulholland doing nothing, </i>
<i>you could be eating breakfast</i>

04:06.246 --> 04:08.039
<i>with your long-lost daughter</i>
<i>and dying mother.</i>

04:08.122 --> 04:09.499
<i>You are a terrible person.</i>

04:09.582 --> 04:11.960
-[horn honking]
-Use the shoulder, asshole!

04:12.669 --> 04:13.670
<i>He gets it.</i>

04:16.589 --> 04:19.509
[laughs] I know,
I wanted to tell you right away.

04:19.592 --> 04:21.970
-Right this way.
-Oh, I gotta go. See you tonight.

04:22.553 --> 04:25.765
If it isn't my favorite client,
Courtney Portnoy,

04:25.848 --> 04:27.350
and also another client, Todd.

04:27.433 --> 04:31.062
It's always nice to be included
in a sentence someone says.

04:31.145 --> 04:34.565
So bad news first: <i>Ms. Taken</i>
was a miserable failure.

04:34.649 --> 04:37.068
-Princess Carolyn--
-But Courtney, more importantly,

04:37.151 --> 04:40.029
audiences are going to adore
your tour de force performance

04:40.113 --> 04:44.450
as the forceful denim-clad court reporter
in <i>The Court Reporter Sported Jorts,</i>

04:44.534 --> 04:47.537
the jet-setting jort-sporting
court reporter story.

04:47.620 --> 04:50.790
Yes, the film is spectacularly romantic
and well-titled,

04:50.873 --> 04:52.625
but I need a change in representation.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.794
No! Courtney! Before you fire me--

04:54.877 --> 04:59.507
I'm not gonna fire you.
Heavens, no! I fired my agents.

04:59.590 --> 05:02.468
Oh, good. Yeah, agents are replaceable.

05:02.552 --> 05:05.179
A manager is forever.
That's the takeaway here.

05:05.263 --> 05:07.807
I think you'll fall in love
with my new agent.

05:07.890 --> 05:10.018
-Love her already. Who is she?
-He.

05:10.101 --> 05:11.936
Yes, he, he, ha, ha.
[chuckles]

05:12.020 --> 05:14.522
-Now tell me her name.
-Rutabaga Rabitowitz.

05:14.605 --> 05:15.982
Oh, fish.

05:16.816 --> 05:19.027
We got a nice bounce
off of Court's engagement.

05:19.110 --> 05:21.863
"Court" is what I'm calling Courtney
for wordplay-related reasons

05:21.946 --> 05:23.990
that'll become apparent
at the end of this sentence,

05:24.073 --> 05:26.451
but that bounce has lost its pounce,

05:26.534 --> 05:28.494
and if we want to keep
this name in the news,

05:28.578 --> 05:31.205
we're going to need a full-<i>court</i> press.

05:32.582 --> 05:35.418
So what do you do after an engagement?

05:35.501 --> 05:38.171
D-d-d-doy!
Wedding of the century.

05:38.254 --> 05:39.088
Whoa!

05:39.172 --> 05:42.675
We're talking floral arrangements.
We're talking procession of elephants.

05:42.759 --> 05:46.012
We're talking Jaden Smith
in a <i>Clockwork Orange</i> costume,

05:46.095 --> 05:47.805
reading a poem he wrote...

05:47.889 --> 05:50.516
Does that poem rhyme? No!
What are you, crazy? Of course it doesn't.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.227
And, uh-oh, was someone looking
for Sebastian Janikowski,

05:53.311 --> 05:54.604
because here's the kicker--

05:54.687 --> 05:58.524
we do the whole thing the weekend
before the movie drops. Bam!

05:58.608 --> 06:00.109
-Weekend before the movie drops?
-Boom!

06:00.193 --> 06:01.652
-That's this weekend.
-Ka-zow!

06:01.736 --> 06:03.321
-Four days from today.
-Ooh.

06:03.404 --> 06:04.864
Today? That's today!

06:04.947 --> 06:08.367
Which is why it's so perfect.
No notice is the new notice.

06:08.451 --> 06:11.245
This wedding is so fancy
we don't care if you have other plans.

06:11.329 --> 06:13.372
-Total status move.
-You're right.

06:13.456 --> 06:15.124
Being engaged is one thing,

06:15.208 --> 06:17.794
but I'm not sure
I want to actually get married.

06:17.877 --> 06:21.130
We can draw up a standard
Hollywoo sham-marriage contract:

06:21.214 --> 06:24.258
-three years, non-exclusive, huge payday.
-Oh.

06:24.342 --> 06:26.302
And I presume
you'll be arranging everything.

06:26.385 --> 06:29.764
As Courtney's agent I'm happy to help,
but I believe traditionally

06:29.847 --> 06:32.391
it's the bride's manager
who plans the wedding.

06:32.475 --> 06:34.352
[groans] Okay.

06:36.938 --> 06:39.023
[thinking] <i>Idiot. Stupid animal. Oaf.</i>

06:39.107 --> 06:41.192
[Bea] You are just the prettiest thing.

06:41.275 --> 06:43.861
-Yes, you are.
-Who are you talking to?

06:43.945 --> 06:47.115
Keep it down, oaf.
You'll make the baby cry.

06:47.198 --> 06:48.074
-Baby?
-Yes, you are.

06:48.157 --> 06:51.577
She kept asking where the baby was,
so I had Tina get her this doll.

06:51.661 --> 06:55.081
-She's totes into it.
-Mom is "totes" into a baby?

06:55.164 --> 06:57.500
Is it possible the baby
got dipped in brandy at some point?

06:57.583 --> 06:59.836
Or cigarettes, or regressive ideas
about immigrants?

06:59.919 --> 07:02.880
-I think she just wanted a baby.
-Coochie-coochie-coo...

07:02.964 --> 07:05.133
You shouldn't indulge her delusions.
It's not right.

07:05.216 --> 07:08.511
But she seemed really down.
And you're never around anymore.

07:08.594 --> 07:10.263
It was getting depressing to look at her.

07:10.346 --> 07:12.348
That's why I made her this pillowcase.

07:12.432 --> 07:15.309
You just put this over her head
and everything is fine.

07:15.393 --> 07:16.686
-[groans]
-[Bea] Dark in here.

07:16.769 --> 07:19.522
-[growls]
-Hello?

07:19.605 --> 07:23.734
So they're airing an <i>F.H.B.A. Miami</i>
marathon this weekend.

07:23.818 --> 07:25.236
Does anyone want to come over?

07:25.319 --> 07:28.322
Oh, I actually have a big announcement.

07:28.406 --> 07:31.534
I'm marrying Courtney Portnoy
this weekend.

07:31.617 --> 07:33.786
-Wow! Great, Todd. Good for you.
-That's amazing.

07:33.870 --> 07:37.665
I know it's pretty wild for an asexual
to get married, but...

07:37.748 --> 07:40.418
Not really. John and I are aces
and we're married.

07:40.501 --> 07:41.461
-Really?
-Yeah.

07:41.544 --> 07:42.795
Our wedding was nautical-themed.

07:42.879 --> 07:45.256
Why nautical?
Is that, like, an asexual thing?

07:45.339 --> 07:47.216
No, man. We just really like boats.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.886
Asexual just means
you're not interested in sex.

07:49.969 --> 07:52.388
Some asexuals are also a-romantic,

07:52.472 --> 07:54.974
but others have relationships
like anyone else.

07:55.057 --> 07:56.851
But involving boats?

07:56.934 --> 07:59.479
I feel like you're getting really hung up
on the boats thing.

07:59.562 --> 08:02.482
So, it's not weird
for an ace to get married?

08:02.565 --> 08:06.652
No, if you found someone who really
accepts you for who you are, go for it.

08:06.736 --> 08:10.740
I will! I mean, I am. I mean, am I?

08:13.659 --> 08:16.537
<i>♪ Beautiful eggs of '44 ♪</i>

08:16.621 --> 08:19.123
<i>♪ For my baby, want some more ♪</i>

08:19.207 --> 08:22.293
Mmm! Beatrice, this coffee is amazing.

08:22.376 --> 08:23.419
[groans]

08:23.503 --> 08:25.713
[thinking] <i>You stupid garbage fire.</i>
<i>Everything sucks.</i>

08:25.796 --> 08:28.174
BoJack, did you see
what your mother is doing?

08:28.257 --> 08:29.550
Isn't it incredible?

08:29.634 --> 08:32.220
Yeah, making breakfast
at three in the afternoon. So with it.

08:32.303 --> 08:36.265
Isn't this baby well-behaved?
Hardly ever cries.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.726
Probably because you're such
a good mother, Beatrice.

08:38.809 --> 08:39.810
Don't say that.

08:39.894 --> 08:42.104
I was very nervous
to have a baby in the house,

08:42.188 --> 08:45.358
but it turns out,
all it needed is a mother's love.

08:46.526 --> 08:50.488
Oh, when you grow up,
you can be anything you want to be.

08:50.571 --> 08:53.491
[thinking] <i>Lousy baby.</i>
<i>What did it ever do that was so great?</i>

08:53.574 --> 08:54.909
<i>Am I jealous of a doll?</i>

08:54.992 --> 08:58.746
<i>Maybe if that doll wasn't so smug,</i>
<i>looking at me with its creepy doll eyes...</i>

08:58.829 --> 08:59.997
She's tricking you, Hollyhock.

09:00.081 --> 09:02.458
-This is not what she's really like.
-Who cares?

09:02.542 --> 09:06.045
Whatever beef you have with your mom,
that's just a sweet confused old lady.

09:06.128 --> 09:08.172
-[thinking] <i>She's right.</i>
-Wrong. She's in there.

09:08.256 --> 09:11.050
-She knows exactly what she's doing.
-You are so paranoid.

09:11.133 --> 09:14.178
Please stop fighting.
All this shouting is bad for the baby.

09:14.262 --> 09:16.973
Where was that keen parenting insight
50 years ago?

09:17.056 --> 09:20.017
[gasps] Henrietta,
you're unfit to be a parent.

09:20.101 --> 09:21.769
-I'm unfit?
-[thinking] <i>It's true, jackass.</i>

09:21.852 --> 09:24.897
You think it's so hard
to be a parent to a doll? I could do that.

09:24.981 --> 09:27.984
Hey, look, I'm cradling the baby.
Hope I don't drop it!

09:28.067 --> 09:29.110
[gasps]

09:29.193 --> 09:31.862
Oh, no! I dropped it, but it's not crying.

09:31.946 --> 09:34.365
Guess it's okay. I'm an amazing parent.

09:34.448 --> 09:37.535
What if I left it in its room all day
and didn't feed it or change it?

09:37.618 --> 09:40.621
Oh, that's okay, too.
I must be mother of the year!

09:40.705 --> 09:42.665
-BoJack.
-I know! What if for 18 years straight

09:42.748 --> 09:46.168
I just tell it how worthless it is
every day, how it embarrasses me,

09:46.252 --> 09:48.212
how my life would be better
if it was never born?

09:48.296 --> 09:50.423
Would that be a good idea?
Probably, right?

09:50.506 --> 09:54.552
Give me the baby back, you worthless waste
of my husband's jism!

09:54.635 --> 09:58.097
-Oh, so you <i>do </i>know who I am.
-Govern yourself, Henrietta.

09:58.180 --> 10:01.350
Hey, you think the baby would be okay
if I threw it over the side of my deck?

10:01.434 --> 10:02.810
-Probably, right?
-[Bea gasps]

10:02.893 --> 10:04.312
BoJack, don't.

10:04.395 --> 10:05.479
[thinking] <i>Do it.</i>

10:05.563 --> 10:08.107
Nah, I'm just kidding around.
Here you go, Mom.

10:08.691 --> 10:10.735
Oh, no! My hands are so slippery!

10:10.818 --> 10:12.445
Oh, no! Oh, oh, oh!

10:14.739 --> 10:17.116
No!

10:18.242 --> 10:19.368
[thinking] <i>Nice arm.</i>

10:20.745 --> 10:22.705
-[sobbing]
-Why did you do that?

10:25.207 --> 10:28.753
-[growling]
<i>-You goddamn piece of shit idiot asshole.</i>

10:30.338 --> 10:32.715
<i>This is what you do.</i>
<i>This is what you always do.</i>

10:32.798 --> 10:36.135
<i>This is why Mom loves Doll more than you.</i>
<i>She's right. Doll never hurt anybody.</i>

10:36.218 --> 10:38.304
<i>Doll wouldn't throw you</i>
<i>over the side of a mountain.</i>

10:38.387 --> 10:40.723
<i>Gotta make things right.</i>
<i>Gotta get Doll back.</i>

10:41.724 --> 10:43.934
<i>Okay, one drink. And then, Doll back.</i>

10:44.518 --> 10:46.604
<i>You screw-up.</i>
<i>You're making your daughter hate you.</i>

10:46.687 --> 10:49.106
<i>Which is good, because look what happens</i>
<i>when people love you.</i>

10:49.190 --> 10:51.567
<i>Look at Penny. And Herb. And Sarah Lynn.</i>

10:52.276 --> 10:54.278
<i>It's because you made them love you,</i>
<i>BoJack.</i>

10:54.362 --> 10:56.614
<i>You gotta fix this, dummy.</i>
<i>How can you fix this?</i>

10:56.697 --> 10:58.240
<i>Princess Carolyn?</i>
<i>She hates your guts.</i>

10:58.324 --> 11:00.117
<i>Todd? No.</i>
<i>Diane? Yes! Oh, good.</i>

11:00.201 --> 11:02.620
<i>Good old responsible Diane,</i>
<i>she'll know what to do.</i>

11:03.079 --> 11:04.163
Oh... aah...

11:05.581 --> 11:07.416
-[groaning]
-Oh.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.418
"California can't wait."

11:09.502 --> 11:11.087
Am I Ace of Base right now?

11:11.170 --> 11:14.131
Because all that I want
is another one of these babies.

11:14.215 --> 11:15.633
BoJack Horseman?

11:15.716 --> 11:18.761
What is this, a will.i.am-style
celebrity endorsement video?

11:18.844 --> 11:20.638
-Where's Diane?
-Oh, she's on the roof.

11:20.721 --> 11:23.557
Boy, will she be surprised
to see you. Diane!

11:23.641 --> 11:24.892
[thinking] <i>What are you doing?</i>

11:24.975 --> 11:26.977
No, not like this.
She doesn't know I'm here.

11:27.061 --> 11:29.355
First time she sees me
can't be drunk asking for help.

11:29.438 --> 11:30.940
-What's wrong? You need help?
-<i>Idiot.</i>

11:31.023 --> 11:32.858
You gotta get me outta here.
Where did I park?

11:32.942 --> 11:34.068
-Um...
-Beep. Beep, beep?

11:34.151 --> 11:35.653
You shouldn't be driving right now.

11:35.736 --> 11:38.406
Why don't I make like Eddie Money
and take you home tonight?

11:38.489 --> 11:41.117
No, I can't go home. Not without Doll.

11:41.200 --> 11:44.078
Also, Eddie Money doesn't do
the taking home in "Take Me Home Tonight,"

11:44.161 --> 11:47.581
so if you're taking me home,
then I would be Eddie Money.

11:47.665 --> 11:49.834
Okay, something's going on with you.

11:49.917 --> 11:51.961
-It's not like you to be so testy.
-Yes, it is.

11:52.044 --> 11:54.255
Everyone, take the rest of the day off.

11:54.338 --> 11:58.384
My pal BoJack needs a friend day.
California can wait!

11:59.343 --> 12:02.138
Elton, you <i>have</i> to play this wedding.

12:02.221 --> 12:04.765
We want one of those <i>Stranger Things</i>
kids to be the ring-bearer.

12:04.849 --> 12:05.850
They're still little?

12:05.933 --> 12:08.602
You're gonna do a duet
with a hologram of Nat King Cole.

12:08.686 --> 12:11.355
Or, if that's cost-prohibitive,
Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes.

12:11.439 --> 12:13.190
Puberty?
Can we give them something for that?

12:13.274 --> 12:15.025
-Great.
-Fabulous.

12:15.109 --> 12:16.360
We are killing this.

12:16.444 --> 12:19.363
We are doing to this wedding
what Rob Durst did to that lady

12:19.447 --> 12:22.158
-and what Fred Durst did to his career.
-[door opens]

12:22.950 --> 12:24.827
I have terrible news. It's Meryl Streep.

12:24.910 --> 12:27.413
-[both gasp]
-Did Meryl Streep die?

12:27.496 --> 12:28.998
No, she's retiring.

12:29.081 --> 12:30.166
Mr. McGregor!

12:30.249 --> 12:33.878
You cannot just walk into a room and say,
"I have terrible news about Meryl Streep."

12:33.961 --> 12:36.172
Her retirement party
is scheduled for this Saturday.

12:36.255 --> 12:37.840
All of Hollywoo will be attending.

12:37.923 --> 12:39.633
This Saturday? No, no, no!

12:39.717 --> 12:42.344
How is #TortneyChortnoy
supposed to compete with that?

12:42.428 --> 12:43.429
We're toast.

12:43.512 --> 12:47.475
Unless, uh, we could somehow get Meryl
to postpone her party?

12:47.558 --> 12:51.395
Hmm... what if we put together
a project so enticing

12:51.479 --> 12:53.063
she couldn't help but climb aboard?

12:53.147 --> 12:56.609
-One more gig...
-Means no more retirement.

12:56.692 --> 12:59.612
But what could we possibly offer her
that she hasn't already done?

12:59.695 --> 13:03.991
-Ah. What does every actor want to do?
-Direct.

13:04.074 --> 13:05.284
-Direct!
-Yeah.

13:05.367 --> 13:08.204
But the dream of any director
is to work with Meryl Streep.

13:08.287 --> 13:11.499
You think Meryl wants to direct
a bunch of actors who aren't Meryl Streep?

13:11.582 --> 13:13.876
-Hah! What a nightmare!
-Okay, all right. Okay, fine.

13:13.959 --> 13:15.336
But, okay, okay, and this...

13:15.419 --> 13:19.340
What if all the actors in the movie
<i>were </i>Meryl Streep?

13:19.423 --> 13:22.134
-What? No!
-Are you suggesting some sort of

13:22.218 --> 13:24.428
<i>Nutty Professor II: The Klumps</i>
type situation

13:24.512 --> 13:26.180
where Meryl Streep plays every role?

13:26.263 --> 13:29.558
Bingo-bongo, weirdo-beardo.
All the greats have done it.

13:29.642 --> 13:32.811
Peter Sellers, Sir Alec Guinness,
Flo from the Progressive ads.

13:32.895 --> 13:34.605
Let's take this to the Streep.

13:37.191 --> 13:40.027
Hey, look. Maybe this is a baby?

13:40.110 --> 13:41.529
-Mmm.
-[door opens]

13:41.612 --> 13:43.113
-Welcome...
-Hey, hey!

13:43.197 --> 13:46.450
...to the nightmare, non-sexy version of
<i>Three's Company </i>that my life has become.

13:46.534 --> 13:49.995
Oh, good. Instead of getting
the doll back, like you said you would,

13:50.079 --> 13:52.748
you disappeared for a few hours
and found a friend.

13:52.831 --> 13:54.542
For your information, we are on the case.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.669
Just need a whiff of your mom
to track the scent.

13:56.752 --> 13:59.713
Uh, excuse me, young lady,
I'm looking for a Beatrice,

13:59.797 --> 14:03.092
but you're way too young and attractive
to be that mean old crone.

14:03.175 --> 14:04.677
-What?
-What are you doing?

14:04.760 --> 14:08.556
[sniffing] Okay, I'm picking up
on some fruity overtones.

14:08.639 --> 14:12.434
Oak, desert sage... [chuckles]
No, I'm just kidding around.

14:12.518 --> 14:13.686
It's smelling humor.

14:13.769 --> 14:16.272
Is this the best time
to be workshopping your tight five?

14:16.355 --> 14:18.899
[sniffing] Okay, got it.
Ooh, this way?

14:18.983 --> 14:21.110
[sniffing] No! No, no. That way!

14:21.193 --> 14:23.195
-[glasses clattering]
-[sniffing]

14:24.196 --> 14:26.240
Out the door! Come on! Here we go!

14:26.323 --> 14:27.741
-[groans]
-[door opens, shuts]

14:29.660 --> 14:32.079
[sniffing]

14:33.289 --> 14:36.542
[thinking] <i>Look at him. Not a care</i>
<i>in the world. How does he do it?</i>

14:36.834 --> 14:39.003
[sniffs] This is the place.

14:39.879 --> 14:40.921
[doorbell rings]

14:41.755 --> 14:43.883
-Oh, hi, I'm--
-BoJack Horseman.

14:43.966 --> 14:46.010
-Felicity Huffman?
-Looking for this?

14:46.093 --> 14:47.970
-Yes!
-Well, keep looking, buddy!

14:48.053 --> 14:50.639
You're a real piece of shit,
you know that?

14:51.348 --> 14:52.766
Yes.

14:52.850 --> 14:55.603
[grunting]

14:57.855 --> 15:00.441
So, instead of talking
through your issues,

15:00.524 --> 15:03.152
your new thing
is to just get in really big fights

15:03.235 --> 15:05.029
and then have hot angry sex?

15:05.112 --> 15:08.032
-Yeah, but it kind of works.
-Does it?

15:08.115 --> 15:10.534
I'm sorry,
I feel like we always talk about me.

15:10.618 --> 15:12.119
What's going on with you, Roxie?

15:12.202 --> 15:15.289
-I'm actually glad you asked, I...
-[grunts] Okay.

15:15.372 --> 15:17.791
Hey, Diane, can I get your advice
on something?

15:17.875 --> 15:19.752
-Yeah, of course. I'm not doing anything.
-Um...

15:19.835 --> 15:22.546
So, I have this friend,

15:22.630 --> 15:26.800
and his name
is Darnarius McQuimberton.

15:26.884 --> 15:28.969
Oh, yeah,
I think I read an article about him

15:29.053 --> 15:31.513
in <i>Real, Not Made-Up, Person Magazine.</i>

15:31.597 --> 15:34.767
Darnarius is supposed to get married
this weekend.

15:34.850 --> 15:38.979
And it's going to be an amazing wedding,
but it's kind of based on a lie.

15:39.063 --> 15:40.481
Should he go through with it?

15:40.564 --> 15:43.943
Well, all weddings are lies, right?
Sort of.

15:44.026 --> 15:45.861
You're making this big declaration

15:45.945 --> 15:48.405
about how you're gonna stay
with this person forever,

15:48.489 --> 15:49.949
but you don't actually know that.

15:50.032 --> 15:52.701
You're just saying it.
The whole thing is a farce.

15:52.785 --> 15:56.664
-Yeah, that's true.
-But it's a lie based on truth.

15:56.747 --> 15:58.415
Like, at the center of the farce

15:58.499 --> 16:01.085
there's this nugget
of something real and pure.

16:01.168 --> 16:04.004
And that strange beautiful something

16:04.088 --> 16:06.423
is why you put up
with everything else, right?

16:06.507 --> 16:07.508
I guess so.

16:07.591 --> 16:11.553
And sometimes it's hard to remember
that pure, shining thing

16:11.637 --> 16:14.598
because it's been painted over
with so many arguments

16:14.682 --> 16:17.142
and compromises and disappointments.

16:17.226 --> 16:20.270
But you have to believe
it's still down there somewhere,

16:20.354 --> 16:21.939
even if you can't see it.

16:22.022 --> 16:26.235
And maybe even the belief in it
is more important than the thing itself,

16:26.318 --> 16:28.946
but only as long as you still believe it.

16:29.029 --> 16:32.241
-Does that make sense?
-Yeah. Thanks, Diane.

16:32.324 --> 16:36.412
You've given me
and Darquimbertus McNarington

16:36.495 --> 16:38.080
a lot to think about.

16:40.916 --> 16:44.545
That was good advice.
I'm, like, a really good friend.

16:45.337 --> 16:46.505
[groans]

16:46.588 --> 16:47.715
[doorbell rings]

16:48.841 --> 16:49.842
-What?
-Okay.

16:49.925 --> 16:53.387
So that doll actually belongs to my mom.
She's very sick, very frail.

16:53.470 --> 16:55.597
And I know you're really mad at me
because...

16:55.681 --> 16:58.225
<i>Think, shit-for-brains, think.</i>
<i>Why is Felicity Huffman mad at you?</i>

16:58.308 --> 17:00.644
<i>You cut her off in traffic,</i>
<i>got her fired off a project,</i>

17:00.728 --> 17:03.689
<i>talked shit about her at an AIDS benefit</i>
<i>and didn't realize your mic was on.</i>

17:03.772 --> 17:07.776
I have been living directly under
your house for the last 15 years.

17:08.360 --> 17:11.572
Do you have any idea how much shit
you throw over the side of your deck?

17:11.655 --> 17:15.534
Beer bottles, lit cigarettes,
scripts where the lead is female.

17:15.617 --> 17:18.370
One time, a mountain
of regurgitated cotton candy

17:18.454 --> 17:22.750
sat on that hill for a month
before sliding into my hot tub.

17:22.833 --> 17:24.293
Who you think has to deal with that?

17:24.376 --> 17:27.337
I assume your maid
or gardener or something?

17:27.421 --> 17:30.591
Well, yeah.
But it's still super-obnoxious.

17:30.674 --> 17:32.259
You're not getting that doll back.

17:32.342 --> 17:33.427
Citizens, citizens.

17:33.510 --> 17:35.471
As the future governor of California,

17:35.554 --> 17:39.058
I pride myself on probably being able
to reach compromises

17:39.141 --> 17:40.976
across the ideological spectrum.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.520
-Oh! What if we cut the baby in half?
-What?

17:43.604 --> 17:44.730
-Why would we do that?
-No.

17:44.813 --> 17:46.523
So you both agree that's a bad idea.

17:46.607 --> 17:48.942
Perhaps you're not so different after all?

17:49.026 --> 17:51.320
-Advantage: Peanutbutter.
-How is that...?

17:51.403 --> 17:54.948
Felicity Huffman, you are a beloved star
of film and television.

17:55.032 --> 17:59.119
BoJack, you have also
appeared in film and television.

17:59.203 --> 18:01.330
What's that like? Discuss.

18:01.413 --> 18:04.291
I'm sorry for my acquaintance.
I'm actually a big fan.

18:04.374 --> 18:06.335
[thinking]<i> I hope</i>
<i>she has no follow-up questions.</i>

18:06.418 --> 18:08.545
Really? So you've probably
seen my new show,

18:08.629 --> 18:10.506
<i>-F.H.B.A. Los Angeles.</i>
-[thinking] <i>What?</i>

18:10.589 --> 18:13.509
-Yup, love it.
-How'd you like to do an arc for sweeps?

18:13.592 --> 18:16.053
[thinking] <i>Ugh, TV? No.</i>
<i>I just got out of that sinkhole.</i>

18:16.136 --> 18:18.889
He'll do it, if you give us our doll back.

18:19.848 --> 18:21.225
Hup... ho... hup!

18:21.308 --> 18:22.684
[Princess Carolyn] <i>What's your status?</i>

18:22.768 --> 18:24.394
I have breached Compound Streep.

18:24.478 --> 18:27.439
If I don't make it out of this alive,
just know I have already seen heaven

18:27.523 --> 18:29.108
and it is Meryl's rose garden.

18:29.191 --> 18:31.151
-And the offer?
-I put it under a big box

18:31.235 --> 18:32.444
that's propped up by a stick.

18:32.528 --> 18:34.363
If she goes to look
and the box falls on her,

18:34.446 --> 18:36.490
she's contractually obligated
to do the movie.

18:36.573 --> 18:38.700
Yeah, I know what
"packaging talent" means.

18:38.784 --> 18:40.119
Okay, she's walking up to the box.

18:40.202 --> 18:43.288
She's sniffing around, and...

18:43.372 --> 18:46.333
-[box slides, woman screams]
-We got Meryl!

18:46.416 --> 18:48.293
All right! Yes!

18:49.545 --> 18:51.338
[thinking] <i>What if I throw myself</i>
<i>off my deck</i>

18:51.421 --> 18:52.798
<i>into Felicity Huffman's backyard.</i>

18:52.881 --> 18:55.259
<i>If she found my dead body,</i>
<i>that'd show her.</i>

18:55.342 --> 18:56.510
Why are we at a bar?

18:56.593 --> 18:58.512
We're just celebrating getting Doll back.

18:59.346 --> 19:01.723
You don't want to bring the doll back
to your mom?

19:01.807 --> 19:03.392
I will. We're just having a drink first.

19:03.475 --> 19:05.018
-Relax.
-Okay.

19:05.102 --> 19:06.812
[thinking] <i>He knows you're terrible.</i>

19:06.895 --> 19:09.481
<i>He's the biggest idiot in the world,</i>
<i>even he knows you're terrible.</i>

19:09.565 --> 19:12.276
So when did you get a daughter?
She's new, right?

19:12.359 --> 19:15.654
-Or was she always part of the gang?
-I met her about a month ago.

19:15.737 --> 19:18.115
-Whoa!
-Yeah. And it was great, at first.

19:18.198 --> 19:19.908
But now I can feel her getting attached,

19:19.992 --> 19:21.743
and I just know
I'm gonna BoJack things up.

19:21.827 --> 19:23.078
"BoJack things up?"

19:23.162 --> 19:25.873
You mean, show up somewhere
and be the life of the party?

19:25.956 --> 19:28.292
Then share a laugh
with your good friend, Mr. Peanutbutter?

19:28.375 --> 19:31.003
No, obviously I meant screw everything up
until she hates me.

19:31.086 --> 19:32.462
I don't think I can take that.

19:32.546 --> 19:35.716
Maybe this time, don't do the thing
that makes her hate you.

19:35.799 --> 19:38.051
I don't want to,
but every time she looks at me

19:38.135 --> 19:39.678
with those big innocent eyes,

19:39.761 --> 19:42.097
all I can think about
is every shitty thing I've ever done,

19:42.181 --> 19:44.349
and I think,
"I don't deserve that kind of love."

19:44.433 --> 19:47.352
Look, BoJack, I don't know a lot
about balancing a state budget

19:47.436 --> 19:49.354
-or how a bill becomes a law.
-Uh...

19:49.438 --> 19:51.398
I don't know a lot about a lot of things.

19:51.481 --> 19:55.194
But I do know this:
everybody deserves to be loved.

19:57.112 --> 19:58.113
[clinking]

19:58.197 --> 20:03.035
So we put together an all-star wedding
and a Meryl Streep movie in one day!

20:03.118 --> 20:05.662
-You got to admit, we're a good team.
-Rutabaga...

20:05.746 --> 20:08.832
I know it wasn't always smooth sailing
for the Good Ship You and Me,

20:08.916 --> 20:11.168
but now you've got a boyfriend
and I've got a family,

20:11.251 --> 20:14.504
and since we have to work together again,
we're a good team.

20:14.588 --> 20:16.340
Tell me you didn't miss this.

20:16.423 --> 20:18.926
-Todd is on line two.
-Aaah! Do you go <i>through </i>the walls?

20:19.009 --> 20:21.637
Todd! Have you finished
your groomsmen list?

20:21.720 --> 20:23.889
We gotta figure out
how many parachutes we need.

20:23.972 --> 20:27.100
Uh, guys, I-- I can't marry Courtney.

20:27.184 --> 20:28.560
-What?
-No!

20:28.644 --> 20:32.648
I've been doing some thinking,
and marriage is like a Tootsie Pop.

20:32.731 --> 20:34.983
The lollipop part is a lie,

20:35.067 --> 20:37.819
<i>but at the center of the lie</i>
<i>there's a truth.</i>

20:37.903 --> 20:41.031
That's the Tootsie Roll,
and that's why people get married.

20:41.114 --> 20:45.285
But if I married Courtney
it would be a lie without any truth in it,

20:45.369 --> 20:48.914
like a Tootsie Pop
with just the lollipop part

20:48.997 --> 20:50.791
and nothing in the middle.

20:50.874 --> 20:54.336
So, a lollipop? That's still pretty good.

20:54.419 --> 20:55.879
[Todd] <i>I guess it's a bad analogy.</i>

20:55.963 --> 20:57.589
But I don't want a fake marriage.

20:57.673 --> 21:00.008
I'm sorry I didn't realize that before.

21:00.092 --> 21:03.262
[sighs] Okay, Todd.
You gotta do what's right for you.

21:03.345 --> 21:05.597
<i>Thanks, Princess Carolyn.</i>
<i>Whoa--</i>

21:05.681 --> 21:06.723
[groans]

21:06.807 --> 21:11.103
All right, blue sky time. Wedding's off.
Can we spin this somehow?

21:11.186 --> 21:13.188
Courtney got jilted,
play the sympathy card?

21:13.272 --> 21:15.065
I guess we could put out a statement.

21:15.148 --> 21:16.191
That's your solution?

21:16.275 --> 21:18.819
What happened to the guy
from this morning with all the big ideas?

21:18.902 --> 21:21.863
Oh, that guy dies at six.
This guy's gotta get home.

21:21.947 --> 21:24.992
I got seven kids and a wife
who's really into me co-parenting,

21:25.075 --> 21:26.868
or, as she calls it, "parenting."

21:26.952 --> 21:30.205
Well, can't you tuck the kids into bed,
read them some script coverage

21:30.289 --> 21:32.791
of the film adaptation of <i>Good Night Moon</i>
and then come back?

21:32.874 --> 21:35.711
-This is important.
-Well, my kids are important.

21:35.794 --> 21:37.587
Fine, both things are equally important.

21:37.671 --> 21:39.840
Oh, my God, thank God you're not a mother.

21:39.923 --> 21:42.217
You would be hilarious at it.
[sips]

21:42.301 --> 21:45.387
Hey, today was fun.
I'll call you in the morning.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.306
We'll figure this out. We'll deal with it.

21:47.389 --> 21:49.808
-[door opens]
-[sighs]

21:49.891 --> 21:52.936
If you'd like to never see him again,
I have ways of getting rid of him.

21:53.020 --> 21:54.563
What kind of ways?

21:54.646 --> 21:57.983
Asking him politely to not come back.
Actually, that's only one way.

21:58.066 --> 22:00.235
I apologize for misleading you
about the number of ways.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.112
He's a jerk, right? It's not just me?

22:02.195 --> 22:03.780
I worked with guys like him at F.M.E.

22:03.864 --> 22:06.533
When I left, I swore
I would never work at a big agency again,

22:06.616 --> 22:08.994
because I can't work
with people like that.

22:09.077 --> 22:10.245
You don't think I'm like that?

22:10.329 --> 22:12.831
No, because you care about people
other than yourself.

22:12.914 --> 22:15.709
And for what it's worth,
you will be a wonderful mother.

22:15.792 --> 22:18.420
-You're not just saying that?
-I never just say anything.

22:18.503 --> 22:19.713
I choose words very carefully,

22:19.796 --> 22:21.965
with an eye towards precision
and expediency.

22:22.049 --> 22:23.717
I'm surprised you haven't noticed that.

22:23.800 --> 22:26.011
-Good night, Judah.
-Mm-hmm.

22:28.263 --> 22:29.306
[door closes]

22:35.771 --> 22:38.774
[muffled grunts and yells]

22:42.152 --> 22:45.405
Okay. [chuckles]

22:45.489 --> 22:48.784
-It's about time, Henrietta.
-You're welcome.

22:48.867 --> 22:50.118
[growls]

22:56.750 --> 22:58.126
[thinking] <i>Go talk to her, idiot.</i>

22:58.210 --> 23:00.921
<i>Drink first. No, you stupid alcoholic.</i>

23:01.004 --> 23:03.590
<i>Talk to your daughter. You're ruining her.</i>
<i>You know that, right?</i>

23:03.673 --> 23:05.467
<i>No matter what,</i>
<i>your poison is already in her.</i>

23:05.550 --> 23:07.344
<i>There's nothing you can do.</i>
<i>That's not true.</i>

23:07.427 --> 23:08.929
<i>Yeah, it is, you stupid piece of shit.</i>

23:09.012 --> 23:12.766
<i>You're a real stupid piece of shit,</i>
<i>and everywhere you go you destroy people.</i>

23:12.849 --> 23:14.392
<i>Your mother never loved you.</i>

23:14.476 --> 23:16.645
<i>That's why Sarah Lynn died,</i>
<i>Charlotte'll never forgive you.</i>

23:16.728 --> 23:19.439
<i>What you gonna do to Hollyhock?</i>
<i>What you gonna do, asshole? Shut up!</i>

23:20.941 --> 23:22.025
[exhales]

23:28.365 --> 23:30.408
Got Doll back. No big deal.

23:30.492 --> 23:33.829
Where do you go,
when you disappear all day?

23:35.831 --> 23:38.333
Just drive around.
Sometimes I go to a bar.

23:38.416 --> 23:40.460
Sometimes I pull over
by the side of the road,

23:40.544 --> 23:42.504
just sit there for hours.

23:42.587 --> 23:43.588
Why?

23:45.632 --> 23:47.592
And you'd rather do that

23:47.676 --> 23:49.678
-than spend time with me?
-Hollyhock...

23:49.761 --> 23:52.264
I know you didn't ask
for this dorky 17-year-old

23:52.347 --> 23:53.682
to just show up at your door.

23:53.765 --> 23:55.725
And I'm sorry if I'm annoying,
but I didn't ask...

23:55.809 --> 23:58.186
-No, Hollyhock, I'm glad you're here.
-Oh.

23:58.270 --> 24:00.772
If I'm shitty,
that's just because I'm shitty.

24:00.856 --> 24:03.775
You're allowed to be mad at me,
but you need to know that whatever I do,

24:03.859 --> 24:05.277
it's not your fault.

24:07.571 --> 24:12.284
I know. I mean, I know,
but I don't always know, you know?

24:12.367 --> 24:15.412
Like, sometimes I have this tiny voice
in the back of my head that goes, like,

24:15.495 --> 24:18.915
"Hey, everyone hates you!
And they're not wrong to feel that way!"

24:19.958 --> 24:21.042
I know what you mean.

24:21.126 --> 24:25.547
That voice, the one that tells you
you're worthless and stupid and ugly?

24:25.630 --> 24:28.341
-Yeah?
-It goes away, right?

24:28.425 --> 24:32.053
It's just, like, a dumb teenage-girl
thing, but then it goes away?

24:33.388 --> 24:34.389
Yeah.
