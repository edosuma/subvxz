00:15.321 --> 00:17.448
Sweetheart, we can't keep him.

00:17.624 --> 00:20.457
What'll we say?
We found him out in a field?

00:20.627 --> 00:23.255
We didn't find him.

00:23.429 --> 00:24.726
He found us.

00:24.898 --> 00:28.356
What are you trying to tell me?
I'm from another planet?

00:28.534 --> 00:31.332
He can't get within five feet
of Lana Lang...

00:31.504 --> 00:33.734
...without turning into
a freak show.

00:36.242 --> 00:40.042
- Who's the maniac driving the car?
- That would be me.

00:40.213 --> 00:41.339
Lex Luthor.

00:41.514 --> 00:45.041
I didn't dive in after Lex's car.
It hit me a 60 mph.

00:45.218 --> 00:49.154
Does that sound normal to you?
I'd give anything to be normal.

00:49.322 --> 00:51.813
I call it the Wall of Weird.

00:51.991 --> 00:56.724
It's every strange event that's
happened due to the meteors.

00:56.896 --> 00:59.797
That's when it all began.
The town went schizo.

00:59.966 --> 01:00.955
What's with you and Lana?

01:01.134 --> 01:04.331
Congratulations, Clark.
You're this year's scarecrow.

01:04.504 --> 01:06.096
Ah, jeez.

01:07.307 --> 01:09.241
Who did this to you?

01:09.409 --> 01:11.877
Doesn't matter.

01:26.526 --> 01:28.721
Thanks for the dance, Lana.

03:40.693 --> 03:44.060
Is this what you
do with your time?

03:46.732 --> 03:50.896
- Where did you get those?
- In that hole you call a room.

03:51.070 --> 03:55.439
- You had no right to go in there.
- You've got a lot of nerve.

03:55.608 --> 03:57.769
I'm in a club with Lana's aunt.

03:57.944 --> 04:03.143
How will I face Nell, knowing
my son is videotaping her niece?

04:03.316 --> 04:07.218
- Is that where you were tonight?
- No.

04:08.855 --> 04:13.189
- I was out collecting.
- Two disgusting habits.

04:13.359 --> 04:16.692
Insects aren't disgusting, Mom.

04:16.863 --> 04:23.063
Look what has become of you, Greg.
This isn't you.

04:24.604 --> 04:27.164
- People change.
- Really?

04:27.340 --> 04:31.572
Monday morning, I'm phoning
Claremont Military Academy.

04:31.744 --> 04:33.177
Yeah, right, Mom.

04:33.346 --> 04:38.579
I've had it with your behavior.
This time I'm making the call.

04:38.751 --> 04:42.118
Hey, who's gonna
take care of my bugs?!

05:26.065 --> 05:28.158
Don't worry, guys.

05:28.334 --> 05:31.599
I'm gonna take you somewhere safe.

06:05.805 --> 06:07.272
No!

06:07.440 --> 06:09.704
No, don't do that!

06:12.778 --> 06:14.268
Stop!

06:25.191 --> 06:26.954
No, no!

06:37.570 --> 06:39.435
Greg?

06:39.605 --> 06:43.063
Greg! Where have you been?

06:44.377 --> 06:45.867
Greg!

08:54.907 --> 08:57.432
It's all your fault, Clark.

08:58.978 --> 09:00.536
Clark!

09:03.115 --> 09:07.814
We're leaving in 15 minutes, and you
haven't done your chores yet.

09:23.335 --> 09:25.826
That looks good, I like that.

09:29.408 --> 09:32.605
All hail the homecoming
king and queen!

09:35.614 --> 09:39.277
Clark! I didn't see you
at the dance last night.

09:39.452 --> 09:40.919
I was...

09:42.021 --> 09:44.717
I was a little tied up.

09:44.890 --> 09:47.381
Hey, congratulations!

09:47.560 --> 09:51.189
I haven't seen an offense
that good since I played.

09:51.363 --> 09:52.660
Thank you.

09:52.832 --> 09:56.290
I'll get the rest of the boxes
out of the truck.

09:58.003 --> 10:00.096
I'll help.

10:00.473 --> 10:01.872
- Lana?
- Thank you.

10:02.308 --> 10:03.536
Kent.

10:05.444 --> 10:09.210
You realize last night
was just a joke, right?

10:11.684 --> 10:15.051
- I need that necklace back.
- I don't have it.

10:15.421 --> 10:17.480
Look, it's Lana's favorite-

10:17.656 --> 10:21.353
Then you'd better go to that
cornfield and find it.

10:32.738 --> 10:35.070
Beautiful, isn't it?

10:36.408 --> 10:40.367
Greg! I didn't recognize
you without your glasses.

10:40.546 --> 10:43.640
You know they only
live for eight hours?

10:43.816 --> 10:45.545
Live fast, die young.

10:45.718 --> 10:49.245
They're the rock stars
of the insect world.

10:49.421 --> 10:51.855
Could you help me with my Lit paper?

10:52.124 --> 10:54.854
Nathanael West assignment giving you
brain freeze?

10:55.027 --> 10:57.655
Yeah, it's kicking my ass.

10:57.830 --> 10:59.127
Sure, okay.

10:59.298 --> 11:02.665
Great. How about my house,
after school?

11:02.835 --> 11:05.531
Library might be easier.

11:05.704 --> 11:07.797
It's a date.

11:08.207 --> 11:11.540
Lana, your aunt's looking for you.

11:14.680 --> 11:20.084
Hey, bug boy, do me a favor
and quit tailing my girlfriend.

11:20.252 --> 11:23.449
You afraid of a little competition,
Whitney?

11:24.723 --> 11:27.556
We're not in competition, Greg.

11:27.726 --> 11:31.822
If I find out you've been
leaving butterflies in her room...

11:31.997 --> 11:34.022
...you'll know about it.

11:38.871 --> 11:41.203
Yeah, well, just remember...

11:41.373 --> 11:46.140
...sometimes you're the windshield,
sometimes you're the bug.

12:01.794 --> 12:04.957
Can't knock your taste in women.

12:05.130 --> 12:09.760
- What happened last night?
- It was just a stupid prank.

12:09.935 --> 12:12.199
You were tied to a stake
in the middle of a field.

12:12.371 --> 12:15.568
Even the Romans saved that
for special occasions. You could've died.

12:15.741 --> 12:17.072
I appreciate your help.

12:17.242 --> 12:21.042
- I just want to forget it ever happened.
- Hey, Clark, what's the holdup, son?

12:21.213 --> 12:24.410
Mr. Kent, it's good to see you.

12:25.551 --> 12:27.018
Lex.

12:27.186 --> 12:30.485
- We've gotta finish up.
- Okay, Dad.

12:30.656 --> 12:33.819
At least I got a handshake this time.

13:35.621 --> 13:38.055
Oh, my God! Jonathan!

13:48.100 --> 13:49.761
Clark!

14:00.479 --> 14:02.606
- Clark!
- Clark!

14:02.781 --> 14:04.646
- Clark!
- Clark!

14:05.651 --> 14:08.643
- Clark.
- Clark.

14:32.377 --> 14:37.940
Whitney will be all right. He's got a couple
of cuts and bruises, but nothing serious.

14:38.117 --> 14:40.881
- Does he remember anything?
- No.

14:41.053 --> 14:46.150
Just that something smashed his truck
and he woke up in the ambulance.

14:48.660 --> 14:51.993
You need to talk to Mom.
I think I really freaked her out this time.

14:52.164 --> 14:55.258
You also made her really proud, Clark.

15:00.506 --> 15:04.169
Something else happened
to me this morning.

15:05.444 --> 15:09.608
When I woke up,
I was kind of floating.

15:11.350 --> 15:13.409
Floating?

15:17.089 --> 15:21.492
As soon as I woke up, I crashed.
What's happening to me?

15:21.660 --> 15:23.594
I honestly don't know.

15:23.762 --> 15:29.132
Soon as you start breaking the law
of gravity, we're in uncharted territory.

15:29.301 --> 15:31.792
I just wish it would stop.

15:31.970 --> 15:36.737
Look, Clark, I'm your father.
I'm supposed to have all the answers.

15:36.909 --> 15:39.673
It kills me that I don't.

15:39.845 --> 15:45.044
But you've gotta have faith.
We'll figure this thing out together.

15:45.384 --> 15:50.185
I do, but this is happening to me
and I'm scared.

16:50.415 --> 16:55.443
Your form's good, but his gait's off.
You might wanna check his shoes.

16:57.723 --> 17:01.921
- Lex Luthor, a friend of your aunt.
- Sneaking up like that...

17:02.094 --> 17:04.425
...you're lucky you didn't get kicked.

17:06.031 --> 17:09.694
You must be Lana.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

17:09.867 --> 17:11.699
We've already met.

17:11.869 --> 17:14.667
I seriously doubt
I'd forget meeting you.

17:14.839 --> 17:18.332
You were a little preoccupied
at the time.

17:18.510 --> 17:20.773
Not a great first impression?

17:20.945 --> 17:25.576
When I was 10, I went to Metropolis
for a riding competition.

17:25.751 --> 17:28.015
Your father invited us to stay over.

17:28.185 --> 17:31.883
My aunt said you had an indoor pool.
I went to check it out...

17:32.057 --> 17:35.390
...and I found you and a girl
skinny-dipping.

17:38.430 --> 17:41.399
I think you were teaching her
the breaststroke.

17:41.566 --> 17:43.534
That was you?

17:43.702 --> 17:45.169
Wow.

17:46.271 --> 17:48.739
You're all grown up now.

17:54.780 --> 17:57.305
Very impressive.

17:58.583 --> 18:02.041
It's tacky,
but it makes my aunt happy.

18:02.220 --> 18:06.350
- That's an unusual necklace.
- Thanks. It's very special to me.

18:06.525 --> 18:08.925
How come you're not wearing it?

18:09.094 --> 18:11.324
I lent it to my boyfriend.

18:11.496 --> 18:15.956
- Lucky guy. What's his name?
- Whitney Fordman.

18:16.134 --> 18:20.503
- The kid that Kent saved today?
- Just came back from seeing him.

18:20.672 --> 18:23.539
He's lucky Clark was there.

18:23.709 --> 18:26.075
I know the feeling.

18:26.611 --> 18:29.944
Makes you wonder
if you're with the right guy.

18:30.115 --> 18:33.448
One chucks footballs,
the other helps save lives.

18:33.618 --> 18:37.884
For someone who just moved here,
you've got a lot of opinions.

18:40.625 --> 18:44.061
You just seem
more interesting than that.

18:44.429 --> 18:47.330
While you're nursing your boyfriend
back to health...

18:47.499 --> 18:50.832
...ask him what he was doing
before the big game.

18:54.906 --> 18:58.069
- He was with me.
- Are you sure?

18:59.811 --> 19:02.678
Tell your aunt I stopped by.

19:20.565 --> 19:23.659
Greg, what's going on here?

19:23.835 --> 19:25.359
Greg!

19:29.508 --> 19:30.941
I have-!

19:39.451 --> 19:41.419
What's gotten into you?

19:41.586 --> 19:44.714
Two million years
of intelligence and instinct.

19:45.057 --> 19:50.290
- You stop this right now.
- I can't. See, it's too late.

19:50.462 --> 19:53.693
Nature's already taken its course.

19:53.865 --> 19:58.928
First I'll eat, then I'll molt.

19:59.104 --> 20:03.268
- Then I'll mate.
- You need help.

20:07.112 --> 20:11.515
Mom, did I ever tell you
about the farrow spider?

20:12.084 --> 20:15.247
It's a fascinating creature.

20:15.420 --> 20:18.878
See, after it hatches...

20:21.126 --> 20:23.594
...it kills its mother.

20:32.804 --> 20:35.364
Save any lives on your way over?

20:35.540 --> 20:38.100
You keep it up, and you could make
a career out of it.

20:38.276 --> 20:42.713
Just dropping off your produce.
Sorry my parents gave you a hard time.

20:42.881 --> 20:46.442
If push came to shove,
I would have arm-wrestled them for it.

20:46.618 --> 20:48.415
Planning an invasion?

20:48.587 --> 20:52.648
- My father gave it to me when I was 9.
- Cool gift.

20:52.824 --> 20:56.282
It wasn't a gift,
it was a strategy tool.

20:56.461 --> 20:59.794
My father equates business with war.

20:59.965 --> 21:04.902
The Battle of Troy started because two
men were in love with the same woman.

21:05.237 --> 21:09.765
Kind of like you and the quarterback.
That's why he strung you up in that field.

21:09.941 --> 21:11.636
If we're at war, Whitney's won.

21:11.810 --> 21:14.370
You lost one battle, that's all.

21:14.546 --> 21:19.279
Besides, I don't believe Lana
is as infatuated as you think.

21:20.952 --> 21:25.048
He captains the football team.
The town treats him like a god.

21:25.223 --> 21:27.418
Game over.

21:27.592 --> 21:33.258
If you hadn't pulled him out of that
truck, your problems would be solved.

21:35.767 --> 21:38.668
I'm kidding, of course.

21:38.837 --> 21:43.774
Don't worry, Clark,
I've got your Trojan horse.

21:53.318 --> 21:56.310
Clark, you okay?

21:57.789 --> 21:59.586
Yeah, I'm fine.

22:08.433 --> 22:12.802
That's a cool box.
What's it made of?

22:12.971 --> 22:17.237
Lead. My mother bought it
in a Casbah in Morocco.

22:17.409 --> 22:20.276
It was made
from the armor of St. George...

22:20.712 --> 22:22.873
...patron saint of Boy Scouts.

22:23.048 --> 22:27.075
She gave it to me before she died.
Think she was trying to send me a message.

22:27.252 --> 22:29.686
I can't take that.

22:30.121 --> 22:33.488
What is it about Kents and gifts?

22:33.658 --> 22:37.025
It's yours. Hand it to Lana
and tell her what happened.

22:37.195 --> 22:40.961
Trust me. Once she opens it,
you'll win her heart.

22:41.132 --> 22:44.533
That necklace gives
you the power, Clark.

22:44.703 --> 22:47.171
All you've gotta do is use it.

23:00.452 --> 23:03.979
Where were you before the game
on Saturday?

23:05.824 --> 23:08.418
Can we talk about this later?

23:08.593 --> 23:11.653
It's a simple question, Whitney.

23:13.098 --> 23:14.360
I was warming up.

23:14.766 --> 23:18.998
So you didn't grab Clark
and hang him up in a field?

23:22.073 --> 23:25.270
Lana, it was just a prank.

23:27.212 --> 23:30.010
Can I please have my necklace back?

23:32.017 --> 23:35.680
- I lost it.
- Were you planning on telling me?

23:35.854 --> 23:38.755
Or was that a prank too?

23:49.234 --> 23:54.604
Lana! I thought you'd forgotten.
I've been waiting for, like, an hour.

23:54.773 --> 23:58.174
You remember, the English paper?

23:58.343 --> 24:03.781
Sorry, Greg, something important
came up. Can we do it another time?

24:05.317 --> 24:08.286
Are you blowing me off
for your boyfriend?

24:08.453 --> 24:10.785
I'm not blowing you off.
I need to see Clark.

24:11.256 --> 24:13.281
Kent?

24:13.458 --> 24:18.828
You'd rather spend time with him?
Is he more important than me?

24:18.997 --> 24:23.457
Greg, I can't talk about this
right now. I have to go.

25:28.366 --> 25:30.027
Lana.

25:30.201 --> 25:34.194
Your mom said I could wait here.
I hope you don't mind.

25:34.372 --> 25:36.465
This is an amazing place.

25:36.908 --> 25:42.278
My dad built it.
He calls it my "fortress of solitude. "

25:42.447 --> 25:46.543
- I didn't know you liked astronomy.
- That's a hobby.

25:46.718 --> 25:51.587
- You can see my house from here.
- No. Really?

25:54.259 --> 25:58.753
We've lived a mile apart all our lives,
and you've never come over.

25:58.930 --> 26:00.955
And you wonder why I'm here now.

26:01.299 --> 26:05.395
Not that I don't enjoy the company,
but yes, I was.

26:07.105 --> 26:13.203
I found out about what Whitney did
to you, the whole scarecrow thing.

26:13.378 --> 26:18.077
- I came to apologize.
- It's not your fault. Forget about it.

26:18.249 --> 26:24.188
I can't. He had no right to do that to you.
And you turn around and save his life.

26:24.422 --> 26:27.880
I appreciate you coming over. You're not
the one who should be apologizing.

26:28.293 --> 26:33.060
I didn't come here to defend him,
I came here to see you.

26:35.867 --> 26:38.961
- Who told you?
- Lex Luthor.

26:40.538 --> 26:44.440
Dropped some bread crumbs,
and I followed the trail.

26:45.877 --> 26:49.938
I'm glad he did, Clark.
He was just being a good friend.

26:50.114 --> 26:54.278
- You're lucky, it's rare.
- Lex is definitely one of a kind.

26:57.755 --> 27:01.555
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm not sure.

27:01.726 --> 27:07.665
I thought I knew Whitney. Now I wonder
what else I've been blind to.

27:10.835 --> 27:13.463
He even lost my favorite necklace.

27:18.576 --> 27:21.409
Can't you get it replaced?

27:21.579 --> 27:27.779
Sounds weird, but it's made from a bit
of the meteor that killed my parents.

27:27.952 --> 27:32.616
Nell had it made, gave it to me
the day she officially adopted me.

27:32.790 --> 27:35.884
She told me that life is about change.

27:36.227 --> 27:39.390
Sometimes it's painful...

27:39.564 --> 27:44.866
...sometimes it's beautiful.
But most of the time it's both.

27:48.673 --> 27:50.163
I better go.

27:53.778 --> 27:56.770
I'm glad you're okay, Clark.

28:47.999 --> 28:49.899
Need a hand, Dad?

28:50.068 --> 28:53.094
That's the best idea
I've heard all night.

29:08.920 --> 29:10.410
Clark?

29:14.926 --> 29:18.225
Clark, what happened?
Are you all right?

29:18.396 --> 29:20.864
There's someone in the rafters.

29:48.059 --> 29:49.720
Dad!

30:19.757 --> 30:22.351
What in the hell just happened?

30:29.300 --> 30:31.768
- I never saw anybody move like that.
- Did you see him?

30:31.936 --> 30:34.598
He came off the ceiling at me.
It was almost as if he-

30:34.772 --> 30:39.641
Wasn't entirely human? I saw his face.
I think it was Greg Arkin.

30:39.811 --> 30:43.508
You and Pete used to hang out
with him in grade school.

30:43.681 --> 30:47.344
- Why would he want to hurt you?
- I don't know.

30:47.518 --> 30:50.715
- Are you still friends?
- I pass him in the halls.

30:50.888 --> 30:52.253
But people change.

30:52.423 --> 30:54.891
His mother used to keep him
on a short leash...

30:55.059 --> 30:57.050
...but I can't believe he'd hurt a fly.

30:57.228 --> 31:01.096
Maybe that's because he was too busy
collecting them and every other bug.

31:01.265 --> 31:04.894
Kids don't leap off
the ceiling and attack people.

31:05.069 --> 31:07.367
How do you explain that?

31:14.579 --> 31:18.037
I don't know, seems kind of out there.

31:19.317 --> 31:25.017
This, coming from the man who's been
hiding a spaceship for the last 12 years.

31:29.861 --> 31:33.058
It's not that I don't
believe you, Clark.

31:33.231 --> 31:36.359
I'm having trouble getting my head
around this one.

31:36.534 --> 31:39.628
You ever wonder why all these
weird things happen in Smallville?

31:39.804 --> 31:43.501
Every town has its share
of tall tales.

31:43.674 --> 31:46.438
Except here they're all true.

31:47.712 --> 31:51.512
Chloe showed me this wall. It was covered
with all these articles she collected...

31:51.682 --> 31:57.086
...about all the weird stuff that's
happened since the meteor shower.

31:57.255 --> 31:59.917
It's all my fault.

32:01.092 --> 32:05.552
If you're talking about 50-pound
tomatoes and two-headed calves...

32:05.730 --> 32:09.757
...then I got a better explanation
for you: LuthorCorp.

32:09.934 --> 32:14.769
God only knows what that fertilizer plant's
been pumping out over the last 12 years.

32:14.939 --> 32:18.136
LuthorCorp. didn't kill
Lana's parents.

32:19.811 --> 32:22.075
Neither did you, son.

32:22.246 --> 32:25.682
You can't blame yourself
for something you had no control over.

32:25.850 --> 32:29.980
I know. I still feel responsible.

32:37.829 --> 32:41.822
What happened to Lana's parents
was a terrible tragedy.

32:41.999 --> 32:45.992
But no matter how many
extraordinary gifts you have...

32:46.170 --> 32:49.571
...you will never be able
to change that.

32:51.475 --> 32:55.969
- How do I make this feeling go away?
- You can't.

32:57.181 --> 32:59.945
But that's what makes you human.

33:07.625 --> 33:11.561
<i>Chloe, is Greg Arkin still
a reporter for the Torch?</i>

33:11.729 --> 33:16.291
If you're definition of a reporter is someone
who actually turns in articles, then no.

33:16.468 --> 33:18.459
Greg hasn't been to the office
for a week.

33:18.636 --> 33:22.003
- I've gotta find him.
- What's the sudden interest in Greg?

33:22.173 --> 33:24.767
You coming out
of the entomology closet?

33:24.943 --> 33:28.572
It's nothing.
I'll catch up with you later.

33:28.746 --> 33:32.273
- I hate it when you do that.
- Do what?

33:32.450 --> 33:36.944
Shut me out. One minute you're here,
and the next you're gone.

33:37.121 --> 33:40.215
Are you outgrowing me as a friend?

33:40.391 --> 33:44.953
I could never outgrow you.
Other than vertically.

33:45.129 --> 33:48.860
It's amazing how far
that Kent charm will get you.

33:49.601 --> 33:51.159
Now what's up with Greg?

33:52.103 --> 33:54.264
I found an article
about Amazonian tribesmen...

33:54.439 --> 33:56.873
...who took on traits of the insects
that bit them.

33:57.041 --> 34:00.636
But nothing as extreme as what you
were talking about. You have any luck?

34:00.812 --> 34:03.713
Only that Greg didn't move here
until after the meteor showers.

34:03.882 --> 34:05.110
So he wasn't exposed.

34:05.283 --> 34:08.480
But his bugs could have been.
Think about it.

34:08.652 --> 34:11.053
Pieces of that meteor
are buried all over Smallville.

34:11.222 --> 34:12.484
The habitat is infected.

34:12.657 --> 34:18.596
So when boy catches bugs and bugs
bite boy, you end up with "bug-boy. "

34:18.963 --> 34:21.864
Look, you can't even walk out your door
in the summertime...

34:22.033 --> 34:23.933
...without being bitten by a mosquito.

34:24.101 --> 34:27.264
Why don't we have a whole town
of "bug-people"?

34:27.438 --> 34:30.998
You need a high level of toxins
to cause a mutation.

34:31.175 --> 34:35.578
Those Amazonian tribesmen
were all attacked by swarms.

34:35.746 --> 34:38.681
Greg did keep tanks of bugs
in his room.

34:38.850 --> 34:42.013
Maybe they got sick
of the view and revolted.

34:42.186 --> 34:44.984
According to this,
bugs have a very short life cycle.

34:45.156 --> 34:50.719
So if he really has gone Kafka, let's
hope he isn't in the mating phase.

34:52.196 --> 34:54.721
Doesn't look like anyone's home.

34:58.403 --> 35:01.964
It's a mess. Remember what
a neat freak his mom was?

35:02.140 --> 35:04.404
Yeah. She used to make us
take off our shoes.

35:04.576 --> 35:06.441
One time I forgot, and she yelled at me.

35:06.611 --> 35:08.340
Is that what broke up the friendship?

35:08.513 --> 35:11.573
His parents got divorced,
and he stopped calling.

35:11.749 --> 35:14.775
Which sucked.
He had a killer tree fort his dad built.

35:14.953 --> 35:17.581
- It was okay.
- Clark never liked it.

35:17.755 --> 35:19.780
He used to get dizzy
just walking over there.

35:19.958 --> 35:21.823
- How come?
- He was afraid of heights.

35:22.427 --> 35:24.793
I didn't believe it was structurally sound.

35:24.963 --> 35:26.988
You guys, come here.

35:29.434 --> 35:32.301
Oh, man, that's disgusting.

35:32.470 --> 35:36.236
- What is it?
- It's skin. He must be molting.

35:36.407 --> 35:39.843
You guys better come in here.

35:40.011 --> 35:42.172
Guys?

35:47.919 --> 35:51.650
Looks like you're not the only one
in Smallville with the hots for Lana.

35:51.823 --> 35:54.917
I think Greg's found his mate.

36:19.017 --> 36:20.848
Lana!

36:31.629 --> 36:34.723
Your aunt said you were out here.

36:34.899 --> 36:37.561
- How you feeling?
- Better.

36:38.069 --> 36:40.663
That's not why I'm here, though.

36:40.838 --> 36:46.140
Lana, when I saw you and Clark outside
your house that night, I freaked out.

36:47.278 --> 36:50.372
What did you think we were doing?

36:50.548 --> 36:55.383
I guess I got scared
and did something stupid.

36:55.553 --> 36:58.147
I would do anything to take that back.

36:58.956 --> 37:03.416
It's too late, Whitney.
She's mine now.

37:03.594 --> 37:05.255
Greg?

37:05.430 --> 37:06.761
Get away from her.

37:09.167 --> 37:12.227
- Greg, what's going on?
- It's time.

37:12.403 --> 37:14.394
Time for what?

37:15.406 --> 37:17.067
For us.

37:28.453 --> 37:30.148
Lana!

37:31.255 --> 37:33.416
Lana!

37:33.591 --> 37:37.254
- Greg's got her.
- What happened?

37:37.428 --> 37:39.692
I'm not sure. Greg threw me
against the wall...

37:39.864 --> 37:41.764
...like it was nothing and grabbed Lana.

37:41.933 --> 37:44.493
- I've never seen somebody that strong.
- Where did he go?

37:44.669 --> 37:47.661
- Off into the woods.
- I know where he's going.

37:47.839 --> 37:50.501
- I'll drive.
- You know the old foundry?

37:50.675 --> 37:52.802
That got hit by the meteor shower?

37:52.977 --> 37:55.673
Follow the dirt track,
100 yards back, there's a tree fort.

37:55.847 --> 37:57.178
How do you know he's there?

37:57.348 --> 37:59.339
Greg collected bugs there
when we were kids.

37:59.517 --> 38:01.883
Look, Kent, I want to apologize-

38:18.770 --> 38:22.604
- Get away from her.
- Greg, I know what's happened to you.

38:22.774 --> 38:26.574
- Then you know that I've been freed.
- No, you're a slave to your instincts.

38:26.744 --> 38:29.907
I have no rules, Clark.

38:30.081 --> 38:32.811
I eat what I want...

38:32.984 --> 38:35.578
...I go where I want...

38:35.753 --> 38:39.883
- ... and I take what I want.
- You're not taking her.

38:40.057 --> 38:43.458
- Then try and stop me.
- You're not the only one who's changed.

39:52.230 --> 39:54.460
You haven't changed at all.

39:54.632 --> 39:58.796
You still get sick around
this place like when we were kids.

39:59.270 --> 40:05.470
Did you know the Buffalo ant can
lift 30 times its own body weight?

40:20.224 --> 40:21.987
Clark!

40:25.863 --> 40:29.492
Clark, where are you?
Come on out.

40:29.667 --> 40:31.897
I just wanna play.

40:36.941 --> 40:42.072
Clark, please...
Come out!

40:42.246 --> 40:44.737
It's lined with lead.

40:50.788 --> 40:54.747
Give it up, Clark.
You can't fight natural law.

40:56.093 --> 40:59.028
Only the strong survive.

41:04.368 --> 41:07.428
Did you think you could hide from me?

41:16.113 --> 41:17.944
Greg, watch out!

41:57.121 --> 41:59.521
It's okay. It's me.

41:59.690 --> 42:05.253
- Whitney?
- You're safe. You're safe. Come on.

43:07.358 --> 43:10.589
Whitney, is that you?

43:11.305 --> 43:17.907
