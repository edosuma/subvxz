00:21.620 --> 00:23.560
Go on, mudgie! Go on, boy.

00:23.600 --> 00:24.880
Attaboy!

00:27.420 --> 00:29.010
Go on, boy.

00:31.040 --> 00:32.990
Come! Come!

00:39.780 --> 00:43.400
Strauss, I'm coming in to
see you this afternoon.

00:45.170 --> 00:48.350
Well, then cancel it.
I'll be there at 2:30.

00:49.320 --> 00:50.590
That's it. Come on, boy!

00:50.630 --> 00:52.910
Come on! Yeah.

01:52.980 --> 01:55.740
I really don't understand this, david.

01:55.780 --> 01:59.010
What's to understand, erin?

01:59.670 --> 02:01.420
You've been retired for nearly 10 years.

02:01.460 --> 02:02.700
B.A.U. Is a man down.

02:02.740 --> 02:04.700
I'm offering to help.

02:05.070 --> 02:08.080
You've written... how many books?

02:08.120 --> 02:09.320
World tours.

02:09.360 --> 02:10.520
Speaking engagements.

02:10.560 --> 02:13.330
Big payday private consultations.

02:13.370 --> 02:15.170
You've made quite a name for yourself.

02:15.210 --> 02:17.870
Well, this is getting boring.

02:17.910 --> 02:19.540
You know, you won't be in charge.

02:19.580 --> 02:22.440
Agent hotchner's the S.A.C. And
I'll be seeking his endorsement.

02:22.480 --> 02:25.390
I'm not looking for
anyone's permission here.

02:25.600 --> 02:29.040
So you're coming in in
a subordinate position.

02:29.080 --> 02:31.830
- Is that a question?
- The question is, why?

02:31.870 --> 02:34.150
To help.

02:36.010 --> 02:38.720
A completely selfless act.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.030
Is that so hard to believe?

02:42.070 --> 02:43.790
Yes.

02:44.620 --> 02:47.240
I missed you too, erin.

02:51.150 --> 02:53.560
You'll meet the team tomorrow.

02:55.710 --> 02:59.420
CARROLLTON, TEXAS

03:08.580 --> 03:10.920
HAVE YOU SEEN ME?

03:23.390 --> 03:25.290
It was next to my front
door when I got home, frank.

03:25.330 --> 03:26.920
God, I hate halloween.

03:26.960 --> 03:28.530
- Here you go, sir.
- Halloween?

03:28.570 --> 03:29.720
Less than a week away.

03:28.570 --> 03:31.190
{\a6}Police Department,
CARROLLTON, TEXAS

03:29.730 --> 03:31.950
It's a prime time for stupid pranks.

03:31.990 --> 03:33.540
So you think it's just a prank?

03:33.580 --> 03:36.790
Well, you're obviously
not missing, michelle.

03:36.830 --> 03:38.690
Where'd they get a picture of me?

03:38.730 --> 03:40.420
It's probably one of your friends.

03:40.460 --> 03:43.270
I don't know anybody
that'd think this is funny.

03:43.310 --> 03:44.510
Molly didn't think it was funny.

03:44.550 --> 03:46.270
She's the one who told me
to come right down here.

03:46.310 --> 03:49.120
If my wife had just called, I
probably could have saved you the trip.

03:49.160 --> 03:51.150
I'm sure it's nothing, really.

03:51.190 --> 03:52.000
You sure?

03:52.150 --> 03:53.810
Look...

03:53.850 --> 03:57.770
I'll come by and check on you after
work and make sure you're safe.

03:58.590 --> 03:59.930
I appreciate that, frank.

03:59.970 --> 04:02.890
Hey. Serving and
protecting is what I do.

04:14.810 --> 04:16.690
No, no, I didn't say it was funny, molly.

04:16.730 --> 04:18.399
I said
someone might--

04:18.440 --> 04:21.720
I--I know she's your best
friend. That's why I'm here.

04:21.760 --> 04:23.770
No. No, I don't think it's
weird she didn't call--

04:23.810 --> 04:24.890
look, I'm here already.

04:24.930 --> 04:25.870
All the lights are out.

04:25.910 --> 04:28.280
She--she probably
went to bed early.

04:28.320 --> 04:29.630
I'll have her call you.

04:29.670 --> 04:32.510
Yeah,20 minutes. I love you, too.

04:40.350 --> 04:42.970
This wasn't funny the first time.

04:44.980 --> 04:46.740
Michelle?

05:00.970 --> 05:02.930
Michelle?

05:25.920 --> 05:27.860
Michelle, it's frank!

05:29.550 --> 05:31.720
Michelle?

05:45.150 --> 05:47.010
Oh, my god.

Erasmus wrote, what else is the whole
life of mortals but a sort of comedy,

06:33.450 --> 06:37.640
in which the various actors, disguised
by various costumes and masks,

06:37.680 --> 06:40.250
walk on and play each one his part,

06:40.290 --> 06:42.710
until the manager waves
them off the stage?

06:44.470 --> 06:46.880
I'm waiting for you!

06:47.290 --> 06:48.260
Reid...

06:48.300 --> 06:50.110
happy all hallows eve, folks.

06:50.150 --> 06:52.200
To paraphrase from celtic mythology,

06:52.240 --> 06:54.000
tomorrow night all order is suspended,

06:54.040 --> 06:59.370
and the barriers between the natural and
the supernatural are temporarily remooooved!

07:00.670 --> 07:02.590
See, that right there is
why halloween creeps me out.

07:02.630 --> 07:03.730
You're scared of halloween?

07:03.770 --> 07:06.150
I didn't say I was scared, I
said I was creeped out.

07:06.190 --> 07:08.080
There's a difference there, youngster.
You should look it up.

07:08.120 --> 07:10.170
What creeps you out about it?

07:10.210 --> 07:11.870
I don't know. People wearing masks.

07:11.910 --> 07:13.540
I don't like folks in disguises.

07:13.580 --> 07:15.890
That's the best thing about halloween.
You can be anyone you want to be.

07:15.930 --> 07:17.940
Nah, I'm pretty good just being me.

07:17.980 --> 07:21.370
Yeah, why is it that neither of
those points of view surprise me?

07:21.410 --> 07:23.160
You know what, though? On the flip side,

07:23.200 --> 07:26.180
it does provide a pretty good
reason to cozy up with a scary flick

07:26.220 --> 07:28.300
and a little halloween honey.

07:28.880 --> 07:31.970
Halloween honey. Now I'm creeped out.

07:32.010 --> 07:33.980
Guys, he's here.

07:46.920 --> 07:48.240
Agent hotchner.

07:48.280 --> 07:49.610
- I'm sure you
remember-- - Dave.

07:49.650 --> 07:50.650
how are you, aaron?

07:50.690 --> 07:53.880
- I'm good. I'm great.
- I would say so.

07:54.150 --> 07:55.270
Saw you on tv last week.

07:55.310 --> 07:57.410
Can't believe you
want to come back here.

08:01.020 --> 08:03.610
Well, I'll let the two of you catch up.

08:04.020 --> 08:07.190
- If you need anything, I'm in my office.
- Thanks.

08:07.530 --> 08:09.140
So how long's it been?

08:10.820 --> 08:12.710
Dinner, almost 3 years ago.

08:12.750 --> 08:14.260
But the last time I was in the B.A.U.

08:14.300 --> 08:18.830
You were sharing a desk with 2 other
agents in that god-awful bunker we were in.

08:18.870 --> 08:19.720
I remember.

08:19.760 --> 08:21.120
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

08:21.160 --> 08:24.360
Well, there's one just like this
next door if you're interested.

08:24.650 --> 08:26.280
I'm ready to give the briefing.

08:26.320 --> 08:28.280
Agent jareau, this is ssa david rossi.

08:28.320 --> 08:29.960
Hi. Everyone calls me J.J.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.039
It is such an honor to meet you, sir.

08:32.080 --> 08:34.309
- I've heard a lot about you.
- Thank you.

08:34.350 --> 08:35.620
And what's your function here?

08:35.659 --> 08:38.169
I'm the communications
coordinator and liaison.

08:38.210 --> 08:41.220
Pretty much the go-between for
the team and the rest of the world.

08:41.260 --> 08:42.539
So I'll gather everyone.

08:42.580 --> 08:43.870
We'll be right there.

08:43.909 --> 08:46.750
- It is so nice to have you here, sir.
- Great.

08:50.250 --> 08:52.400
We didn't have that 10 years ago.

08:52.650 --> 08:54.110
What do you mean?

08:54.660 --> 08:57.790
- Communications coordinator.
- Right.

08:57.830 --> 09:00.390
Oh, lots has changed. Come meet the team.

09:04.710 --> 09:07.680
Ssa david rossi, this
is ssa emily prentiss.

09:07.720 --> 09:08.200
Sir.

09:08.350 --> 09:09.810
Ssa derek morgan.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.010
It's an honor, agent rossi.

09:11.050 --> 09:12.080
Please, just dave.

09:12.120 --> 09:13.390
And dr. Spencer reid.

09:13.430 --> 09:16.680
Sir, if I could talk to you later about
your work with the scarsdale skinner.

09:16.720 --> 09:18.880
Psycho-linguistics is an
incredibly dynamic field,

09:18.920 --> 09:21.560
and the fact that your profile of his
reading habits ultimately led to his capture

09:21.600 --> 09:24.060
- is something I find so incredibly
intrig-- - reid, slow down.

09:24.100 --> 09:26.350
He'll be here for a while. You
can catch up with him later.

09:26.390 --> 09:28.380
- Sorry.
- No problem, doctor.

09:28.420 --> 09:29.770
Maybe you guys can talk on the jet.

09:29.810 --> 09:31.150
- Oh, yeah, that'd be great.
- The jet?

09:31.190 --> 09:31.980
We have a jet now.

09:32.130 --> 09:34.160
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. It comes in pretty handy.

09:34.200 --> 09:35.910
Come on. J.J.'S waiting.

09:47.670 --> 09:50.770
Carrollton, texas, is a suburb
just outside of dallas.

09:50.810 --> 09:55.180
4 days ago, michelle colucci found
this flier on her front door.

09:56.000 --> 09:56.820
She found it?

09:56.970 --> 09:58.350
Meaning she wasn't actually missing?

09:58.390 --> 10:00.850
Yet. She took the flier
to a friend's husband,

10:00.890 --> 10:03.580
detective yarbrough,at
the carrollton P.D.

10:03.620 --> 10:06.350
Who told her it was probably just a
halloween prank, and he sent her home.

10:06.390 --> 10:07.560
Well, I don't blame him.

10:07.600 --> 10:09.150
Halloween brings out
the fool in everyone.

10:09.190 --> 10:11.890
Still, he stopped by michelle's
house later to check on her.

10:11.930 --> 10:15.140
The door was open, and when
he went inside, he found this.

10:16.780 --> 10:21.420
He still thought maybe it could be
some kind of a prank, until yesterday.

10:21.810 --> 10:26.490
Michelle was found floating in a
small creek just outside of carrollton.

10:26.790 --> 10:29.410
She had been sexually assaulted...

10:30.500 --> 10:33.390
and her face had been removed.

10:34.830 --> 10:36.930
Removed? It wasn't animals or fish?

10:36.970 --> 10:41.540
The dallas county M.E. Say that the
edges of the wounds were smooth,not torn.

10:41.580 --> 10:43.590
A very sharp instrument had been used.

10:43.630 --> 10:46.470
He also found water in her lungs.

10:47.610 --> 10:49.380
Oh, my god!

10:50.590 --> 10:51.930
What is that?

10:51.970 --> 10:56.100
Technical analyst penelope
garcia, this is ssa david rossi.

10:56.140 --> 10:57.650
Is it gone,J.J.?

10:57.690 --> 11:00.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're safe.

11:00.710 --> 11:03.090
OK. Just to, um...

11:03.130 --> 11:07.790
carrollton,texas,has
nearly 117,000 residents,

11:07.830 --> 11:11.290
a diverse population with
A... it's all in there.

11:11.330 --> 11:12.580
I'm sorry.

11:12.620 --> 11:14.910
Very happy to meet you, sir.

11:15.210 --> 11:17.900
I'll be in my office.

11:19.480 --> 11:21.280
Sorry.

11:22.820 --> 11:24.420
She's different.

11:24.460 --> 11:26.300
You have no idea.

11:26.340 --> 11:30.410
Uh, so, the unsub tells her she's going to
go missing to psychologically torture her,

11:30.450 --> 11:32.560
then tortures her physically.

11:32.600 --> 11:33.780
Textbook sadist.

11:33.820 --> 11:35.320
A sophisticated one.

11:35.360 --> 11:37.470
That's elaborate.

11:37.510 --> 11:39.500
Number one.

11:39.910 --> 11:42.540
That particular mask is
known as a false face.

11:42.580 --> 11:45.330
It's most commonly worn during
halloween and mardi gras.

11:45.370 --> 11:47.000
Creepy. I rest my case.

11:47.040 --> 11:47.870
False face.

11:48.020 --> 11:52.150
Her face-- he mocks
it, then destroys it.

11:53.900 --> 11:57.250
Oh, and, hotch-- local media
has the story. It broke big.

11:57.290 --> 11:59.490
Tell carrollton we'll be there
first thing in the morning.

11:59.530 --> 12:02.090
- Let's stop this one at one.
- Yes, sir.

12:02.610 --> 12:06.150
If you want to take some time to get
situated, maybe start on the next case?

12:06.190 --> 12:08.900
I'm not back to get
situated, hotch, I'm here to work.

12:09.720 --> 12:12.660
Everybody get your things
together. We're going to texas.

12:13.160 --> 12:14.460
Abbey, what's the latest?

12:14.500 --> 12:17.130
Police sources tell me they
have no leads in the case

12:17.170 --> 12:19.700
they are calling the
"have you seen me"Murders.

12:19.740 --> 12:21.950
Where the hell do you get this stuff?

12:21.990 --> 12:25.640
No, not you, agent jareau. The television.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.110
The press is saying we gave
this thing a stupid name,

12:28.150 --> 12:31.040
like it's some kind of
damn game or something.

12:32.260 --> 12:33.630
Just...

12:33.670 --> 12:37.520
call me when you all get in tomorrow.
I'll take you wherever you need to go.

12:37.660 --> 12:39.910
All right. Good night.

12:41.030 --> 12:43.550
Abbey, do we know when
this flyer first surfaced?

12:43.590 --> 12:47.810
We have heard reports that ms. Colucci
received this flier late tuesday afternoon

12:47.850 --> 12:49.590
when she returned home from work.

12:49.850 --> 12:50.620
*****

12:50.770 --> 12:53.400
Never saw the point at
throwing an egg at anything.

12:51.990 --> 12:55.450
{\a6}DALLAS, TEXAS

12:53.410 --> 12:56.520
Or even the connection to
halloween, for that matter.

13:01.690 --> 13:03.730
What the hell...

13:03.770 --> 13:07.030
oh, my god. That's me.

13:11.950 --> 13:15.230
Oh, my god!

13:47.660 --> 13:49.420
Let's go over victimology.

13:50.350 --> 13:52.560
Would you like to join us, dave?

13:58.020 --> 13:59.460
Reid, what have you got?

13:59.750 --> 14:01.920
Uh, michelle colucci was single,

14:01.960 --> 14:04.710
lived alone, no boyfriend
and no ex-husband.

14:04.750 --> 14:05.510
Dating?

14:05.660 --> 14:06.860
There's nothing in the reports.

14:06.900 --> 14:07.730
She was an architect.

14:07.770 --> 14:11.150
Friends and co-workers say
she's a class workaholic.

14:11.190 --> 14:13.390
Basically a loner who
rarely went out of the house.

14:13.430 --> 14:15.210
So she's extremely low risk.

14:15.250 --> 14:18.920
If it wasn't someone she knew personally,
it's possible she was being stalked.

14:18.960 --> 14:21.500
- Interesting.
- What's that?

14:22.810 --> 14:24.730
Oh, I'm just thinking out loud.

14:24.770 --> 14:27.120
- Something to add?
- No.

14:27.160 --> 14:29.430
Sorry to interrupt.

14:30.690 --> 14:32.100
Well, she's pretty.

14:32.140 --> 14:34.760
It could be that the unsub
met her casually and...

14:34.990 --> 14:36.420
made her part of some kind of fantasy.

14:36.460 --> 14:38.500
And he tries to act on
it and she rejects him?

14:38.540 --> 14:41.870
So he tortures her, out of anger?

14:42.380 --> 14:44.680
Masks often represent a state of mind.

14:44.720 --> 14:48.240
This one's blank, expressionless.
Doesn't really coincide with anger.

14:48.280 --> 14:51.300
Reid, it's hard to imagine he did
this out of anything less than rage.

14:51.340 --> 14:52.960
Hey, guys.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.450
What's up? You got something for us?

14:54.490 --> 14:56.250
A list of michelle colucci's clients.

14:56.290 --> 15:00.310
She designed office space. Mostly
big corporate remodeling plans.

15:00.350 --> 15:02.270
No private
clients, one-on-one contact?

15:02.310 --> 15:04.060
Doesn't look like it, no.

15:04.100 --> 15:06.360
- Thanks, baby girl.
- Yeah.

15:13.960 --> 15:15.950
It's right this way, ma'am.

15:15.990 --> 15:18.270
Police Department CARROLLTON. TEXAS

15:19.190 --> 15:20.980
- Detective yarbrough?
- Fbi?

15:21.020 --> 15:23.970
We got another flier--
this time metro dallas.

15:24.630 --> 15:25.930
Enid white.

15:25.970 --> 15:28.360
Her roommate called
dallas P. D. This morning.

15:28.680 --> 15:31.210
Enid never game home after
walking her dog last night.

15:31.250 --> 15:32.300
So she is missing.

15:32.340 --> 15:35.790
Well, he wallpapered the neighborhood with
fliers for 2 blocks around their apartment.

15:35.830 --> 15:37.200
Outside. That's different.

15:37.240 --> 15:38.880
No one saw him putting them up?

15:38.920 --> 15:41.500
Dallas P. D. Is still
canvassing, but nothing so far.

15:41.540 --> 15:43.020
They're waiting for
you on the new scene.

15:43.060 --> 15:44.790
- Mind if I keep this?
- Not at all.

15:44.830 --> 15:46.990
Morgan, you and prentiss go
to michelle colucci's house.

15:47.030 --> 15:49.130
J. J. And I will talk to enid's roommate.

15:49.170 --> 15:51.700
Dave, do you mind walking the disposal
site with the detective and reid?

15:51.740 --> 15:52.540
Whatever you need.

15:52.580 --> 15:54.660
We'll regroup in an hour.

16:03.050 --> 16:04.820
These houses sure are close together.

16:04.860 --> 16:05.540
Yeah.

16:05.690 --> 16:09.460
So how do I get a woman out of
her house without anyone seeing me?

16:09.830 --> 16:13.350
Well, he must have been watching her for
a long time and knew that it was safe.

16:13.390 --> 16:16.300
There isn't a lot of
cover on this street.

16:19.630 --> 16:21.300
I have a vehicle.

16:22.210 --> 16:24.670
Big enough so I can
watch without being seen.

16:24.710 --> 16:27.670
But not so big as to
draw attention to itself.

16:27.710 --> 16:28.760
No.

16:28.800 --> 16:33.360
Neighbors will notice a strange vehicle parked in
front of their house day after day, night after night.

16:33.400 --> 16:34.250
It's human nature.

16:34.290 --> 16:37.530
You would notice something out
of place in your own neighborhood.

16:37.570 --> 16:41.360
And you would definitely notice a man
repeatedly standing on your street.

16:44.050 --> 16:46.570
Yeah. It just doesn't make any sense.

16:47.730 --> 16:49.740
He didn't watch from here.

16:50.560 --> 16:54.040
As we reported earlier, enid white
is still considered missing...

16:54.080 --> 16:55.380
big story.

16:55.420 --> 16:56.570
Leeches.

16:56.610 --> 16:59.170
Haven't had something this
big to play in a long time.

16:59.210 --> 17:00.910
Did the press run with
the story about the mask?

17:00.950 --> 17:02.270
Mask?

17:02.820 --> 17:05.290
A mask was left at michelle
colucci's apartment.

17:05.329 --> 17:06.920
First time I'm hearing about it.

17:06.960 --> 17:07.730
Good.

17:07.880 --> 17:10.290
- Let's make sure that stays ours.
- Yeah.

17:11.579 --> 17:14.640
Miss white's roommate says that enid walks
her dog every night at the same time,

17:14.680 --> 17:17.109
takes the same route, right
down this street.

17:17.150 --> 17:19.359
Nothing a stalker likes
better than routine.

17:19.400 --> 17:20.960
Well, she definitely would have seen this

17:21.000 --> 17:23.230
if this was here
before she went missing.

17:23.500 --> 17:26.460
A couple of neighbors say they may have
seen a guy putting up a flier during the day,

17:26.500 --> 17:29.070
bueaey rt thlly couldn't
remember anything about him.

17:29.110 --> 17:31.540
All right, well, we're gonna have to
know everything we can about the victim.

17:31.580 --> 17:33.920
I know you sent some
stuff over to quantico,

17:33.960 --> 17:37.410
but it would help us if we could
interview the roommate ourselves.

17:37.450 --> 17:39.040
We have her downtown now.

17:39.630 --> 17:42.420
- Where's her dog?
- Excuse me?

17:42.880 --> 17:46.350
If she was abducted while she was
walking her dog. Where's her dog?

17:50.310 --> 17:52.430
We went over this
area pretty thoroughly.

17:52.470 --> 17:54.530
There's no evidence left.

17:55.440 --> 17:58.650
I just want to stand where she was.

18:00.690 --> 18:04.600
Dr. Reid, do we still keep all the old
files in the fourth floor storeroom?

18:04.640 --> 18:07.570
I think some are up there. You know, most
of our information's on computer now.

18:07.610 --> 18:08.210
Right.

18:08.360 --> 18:11.110
Have you had a chance to go through
our data since you've been back?

18:11.150 --> 18:11.940
Not yet.

18:12.090 --> 18:12.900
You'll be amazed.

18:13.050 --> 18:14.140
The original
team--

18:14.180 --> 18:16.730
I mean, you interviewed something like,

18:16.770 --> 18:19.020
- uh,45 serial killers, right?
- Something like.

18:19.060 --> 18:20.880
Today we have interviews
with over 1,000 offenders.

18:20.920 --> 18:23.160
Serial killers, child
abductors, sex offenders--

18:23.200 --> 18:25.200
I'll go through it with you sometime
if you like, answer any questions--

18:25.240 --> 18:27.000
sounds good.

18:30.310 --> 18:33.160
Michelle's body was found right here.

18:33.200 --> 18:35.800
I really thought it was a prank.

18:36.730 --> 18:39.530
You can't really blame
yourself for that.

18:40.170 --> 18:42.090
She made herself dinner.

18:42.130 --> 18:43.590
Excuse me?

18:43.630 --> 18:46.380
She had time to make herself dinner.

18:46.860 --> 18:50.640
I mean she was home
for a while before he...

18:52.710 --> 18:55.680
there was time to help her.

18:55.720 --> 18:57.680
Water.

18:59.080 --> 19:01.650
Obliterates a body...

19:02.240 --> 19:05.500
destroys evidence.

19:20.440 --> 19:24.090
But you weren't in the water
that long, were you, michelle?

19:24.130 --> 19:26.740
She had rocks tied to
her to weigh her down.

19:26.780 --> 19:30.250
She floated to the surface
before there was any other damage.

19:30.290 --> 19:32.940
Just what was done to her already.

19:32.980 --> 19:38.300
The salient point is that it was the
first thing the unsub wasn't good at.

19:40.350 --> 19:43.700
Green river dumped most
of the bodies in the water.

19:45.020 --> 19:47.500
- But they weren't weighed down.
- Yeah.

19:47.540 --> 19:50.560
We know now it's'ause he
didn't care if they were found.

19:51.170 --> 19:53.860
He had no connection to them.

20:00.390 --> 20:02.310
This is where I'd wait.

20:02.350 --> 20:03.720
Yeah.

20:04.020 --> 20:06.750
I'd never be able to
see you from the house.

20:11.730 --> 20:13.350
Prentiss.

20:14.030 --> 20:15.980
He was here a lot.

20:17.230 --> 20:20.180
Watching everything she did.

20:38.920 --> 20:40.150
we got anything?

20:40.190 --> 20:42.520
Agent rossi pointed out that since
the victims were weighted down,

20:42.560 --> 20:44.430
it suggests the unsub
didn't want them found.

20:44.470 --> 20:47.450
It suggests some sort of
connection between them.

20:47.490 --> 20:49.300
Detective, how long was michelle missing?

20:49.340 --> 20:50.980
She was found on the fourth day.

20:51.020 --> 20:54.130
So if she wasn't in the water
long, then he held her for 3.

20:54.950 --> 20:55.440
Garcia?

20:55.590 --> 20:58.910
I've been running all of
enid white's credit cards.

20:58.950 --> 20:59.660
And?

20:59.810 --> 21:04.360
She made a purchase at 9 A. M. This morning
at a sporting goods store in dallas.

21:04.400 --> 21:05.440
This morning?

21:05.480 --> 21:06.490
What did she buy?

21:06.530 --> 21:08.570
A shotgun.

21:12.070 --> 21:13.550
Thanks.

21:15.780 --> 21:21.280
The man was seen posting fliers around the
neighborhood where enid white was known to walk her dog.

21:21.320 --> 21:24.860
The police are still unable to give
us any information at this time,

21:24.900 --> 21:27.840
and they are saying they
still have no possible leads.

21:27.880 --> 21:29.630
We will continue to keep you posted

21:29.670 --> 21:33.960
as we receive more details
about the hunt for enid white...

21:34.000 --> 21:35.590
she can buy a gun that easily?

21:35.630 --> 21:36.830
This is texas.

21:36.870 --> 21:40.000
There's no license or waiting
period for most rifles or shotguns.

21:40.040 --> 21:42.520
Is there video surveillance of
guns sales in sporting goods stores?

21:42.560 --> 21:43.680
There's supposed to be.

21:43.720 --> 21:44.640
J.J.,Call the store.

21:44.680 --> 21:47.200
Find out if it was enid or the
unsub using her credit card.

21:47.240 --> 21:48.690
Right away.

21:48.730 --> 21:49.640
Detective yarbrough.

21:49.680 --> 21:51.900
There's an urgent call
from a woman on one.

21:53.290 --> 21:54.620
Detective yarbrough.

21:54.660 --> 21:56.420
My name is enid white.

21:56.460 --> 21:58.370
Where are you, enid

21:58.650 --> 22:04.260
The news reports said that the police didn't believe
that other woman when she saw the missing fliers.

22:04.300 --> 22:06.290
That was a mistake, enid.

22:06.330 --> 22:08.220
I have a gun.

22:08.260 --> 22:11.170
I don't think I can stay
awake very much longer.

22:11.590 --> 22:13.460
Enid, this is agent hotchner of the fbi.

22:13.500 --> 22:15.890
We believe you, and we want to help you.

22:15.930 --> 22:17.380
Can you tell us where you are?

22:17.420 --> 22:20.540
El royale motel in dallas.

22:20.580 --> 22:22.060
It's room 6.

22:22.100 --> 22:23.510
I saw the fliers.

22:23.550 --> 22:24.860
Hurry, please.

22:24.900 --> 22:26.100
He's gonna kill me.

22:26.140 --> 22:28.760
Don't move, enid. We're on our way.

22:40.830 --> 22:42.380
Fbi!

22:47.290 --> 22:49.520
Clear.

22:50.850 --> 22:52.560
She's gone.

23:02.660 --> 23:03.800
20 minutes.

23:03.840 --> 23:05.030
We were here in 20 minutes.

23:05.070 --> 23:06.210
I can't believe we lost her.

23:06.250 --> 23:08.450
We may not have lost her.
He kept michelle for 4 days.

23:08.490 --> 23:09.520
But we got nothing.

23:09.560 --> 23:11.530
That's not true. Look at
the difference in the scenes.

23:11.570 --> 23:13.250
What do you mean? There's
the masks, the fliers.

23:13.290 --> 23:14.980
Yeah, but these fliers weren't tacked up,

23:15.020 --> 23:16.200
they were just thrown around the room.

23:16.240 --> 23:16.990
So?

23:17.140 --> 23:19.540
He left in a hurry like
he knew we were coming.

23:20.180 --> 23:21.760
OK, this was under the bed.

23:21.800 --> 23:23.090
972 area code.

23:23.130 --> 23:24.480
That's carrollton.

23:24.520 --> 23:25.740
The hotline number.

23:25.780 --> 23:27.650
She used a cell phone.

23:28.010 --> 23:30.020
You can get a cell interceptor
at any electronics store.

23:30.060 --> 23:30.830
You can?

23:30.980 --> 23:32.370
Yeah. They don't cost that much.

23:32.410 --> 23:35.020
He probably sat right out here
and heard everything she said.

23:35.060 --> 23:36.490
But if he followed her here from dallas,

23:36.530 --> 23:38.500
why wait till she
calls us to move on her?

23:38.540 --> 23:41.600
To make sure it was the
police who found the mask.

23:41.640 --> 23:44.390
We need to gather your
men and give a profile.

23:46.890 --> 23:48.160
He's a white male.

23:48.200 --> 23:51.680
His shoe prints have been examined
and put him at about 5'11,165.

23:51.720 --> 23:55.120
So we've narrowed it down to
anyone of average weight and height.

23:55.160 --> 23:56.750
Exactly.

24:14.550 --> 24:16.880
Speak and be recognized
by your empress, mortal.

24:16.920 --> 24:19.070
Is this the technical analyst girl?

24:19.110 --> 24:19.800
Who's this?

24:19.950 --> 24:22.750
Dr. Reid said this was your
direct line from the team.

24:22.790 --> 24:24.330
It is.

24:24.370 --> 24:26.940
This is agent dave
rossi. We met yesterday.

24:27.250 --> 24:29.780
Of course, of course.
I'm sorry--sir.

24:29.820 --> 24:35.130
Uh, yeah, I already started processing the
footprint information on michelle colucci--

24:35.170 --> 24:37.160
no, no, no. This is about something else.

24:38.010 --> 24:42.070
All the past open cases the
B. A. U. Worked on are on computer now?

24:42.110 --> 24:42.880
Most of them.

24:43.030 --> 24:44.770
There may be a few left to catalog.

24:44.810 --> 24:48.120
If I give you a victim's
name, could you find the old records?

24:48.160 --> 24:50.100
Oh, records are my specialty, sir.

24:50.140 --> 24:53.640
The original case--
I'm going back 20 years.

24:53.680 --> 24:55.190
Won't be a problem.

24:55.230 --> 24:57.810
The name is galen.

24:57.850 --> 25:01.560
Diana and richard galen.

25:02.190 --> 25:04.450
They had 3 children.

25:04.490 --> 25:07.680
OK. I will get back to you
super fast. Scout's honor.

25:07.720 --> 25:10.080
No, no, um, just put a file together.

25:10.120 --> 25:11.860
I'll get it when I get back.

25:11.900 --> 25:13.190
It's really no problem, sir. I
could just send it--

25:13.230 --> 25:15.980
not necessary. I'll look
at it when I get back.

25:16.020 --> 25:21.250
And let's keep this between
us, if you don't mind. For now.

25:21.840 --> 25:23.500
OK.

25:23.700 --> 25:25.070
Thank you.

25:25.500 --> 25:27.880
My pleasure entirely, sir.

25:34.850 --> 25:40.510
There's a sophistication and patience in what
this unsub does that suggests a level of maturity.

25:40.550 --> 25:44.100
We believe this puts his age
in the mid-30s to 40s range.

25:44.140 --> 25:46.480
Michelle colucci was taken
from the primary crime scene

25:46.520 --> 25:49.500
and disposed of at the tertiary
crime scene 4 days later.

25:49.540 --> 25:52.140
That means she was held
somewhere for at least 3 days.

25:52.180 --> 25:54.410
You can't really just hold a
victim anywhere for days on end,

25:54.450 --> 25:57.240
so he most likely has access
to a house of some kind.

25:57.280 --> 25:59.220
And he's also fairly tech savvy.

25:59.260 --> 26:00.950
The fliers were made on a computer.

26:00.990 --> 26:04.020
And it's probable that he used a device
to intercept enid white's phone call.

26:04.060 --> 26:05.620
Witnesses in enid
white's neighborhood say

26:05.660 --> 26:07.770
they may have seen a white
man putting up fliers,

26:07.810 --> 26:12.490
but none of them could describe him, even with
all the media attention this case has received.

26:12.530 --> 26:13.320
Great.

26:13.470 --> 26:18.190
Actually, what that tells us is that there is
absolutely nothing remarkable about this man.

26:18.230 --> 26:20.390
He is exceedingly average.

26:20.430 --> 26:23.670
As you said, detective
yarbrough, average height, average build.

26:23.710 --> 26:25.610
It extends to his
professional life as well.

26:25.650 --> 26:30.040
He most likely works in a field where he
doesn't stand out, doesn't really make a mark.

26:30.080 --> 26:32.680
His lack of distinction
is part of his psychopathy.

26:32.960 --> 26:35.690
We have hundreds of interactions
with people every day.

26:35.730 --> 26:38.960
Most of those involve someone
overlooking someone else.

26:39.690 --> 26:44.520
Most of us don't pay any attention to
being ignored, but to this kind of unsub,

26:44.810 --> 26:46.650
each oversight is intentional.

26:46.690 --> 26:49.920
Especially when it comes from
his object of sexual desire.

26:49.960 --> 26:53.480
He begins to obsess over her
until she's all he can think about.

26:53.520 --> 26:56.780
And the rage builds until
he has to attack that person.

26:56.820 --> 26:59.410
So he's pissed off
that nobody notices him?

26:59.450 --> 27:00.690
Have you seen me?

27:00.730 --> 27:02.660
Wait. That's not about the women.

27:02.700 --> 27:04.960
No. The masks are
about the women--

27:05.000 --> 27:06.590
number one, number 2.

27:06.630 --> 27:08.730
The fliers probably refer to him.

27:08.770 --> 27:13.930
Removing his victims'faces transfers his
feelings of being ignored into a mission

27:13.970 --> 27:16.100
and it gives him a sense of power.

27:16.140 --> 27:20.070
And the power can make him arrogant, but
it doesn't make him notable.

27:20.110 --> 27:22.210
So how the hell do we
catch an invisible man?

27:22.250 --> 27:24.420
I'm pretty sure we can
get him to contact you.

27:24.460 --> 27:24.990
What?

27:25.140 --> 27:28.470
Well, the crime scenes show he wants
to deliver his message to the police.

27:28.510 --> 27:29.660
He isn't going public.

27:29.700 --> 27:32.650
Hopefully, by playing on his anger...

27:34.690 --> 27:36.800
J.J.,How'd they get that?

27:36.840 --> 27:37.670
Not from
me. I--

27:37.820 --> 27:41.730
hotch, I called all the local police
departments and I stressed withholding the mask.

27:41.770 --> 27:43.190
I called them.

27:44.390 --> 27:46.050
What?

27:46.090 --> 27:50.140
I said the fbi thinks the
masks mean he's impotent.

27:53.310 --> 27:55.410
Can I speak to you for a second?

28:01.280 --> 28:02.950
Why would you do that?

28:02.990 --> 28:04.600
It'll make him contact us.

28:04.640 --> 28:05.690
He's screaming for it.

28:05.730 --> 28:07.020
We aren't prepared.

28:07.060 --> 28:07.680
Prepared?

28:07.830 --> 28:09.130
We need to set up a trap and trace.

28:09.170 --> 28:10.180
Trap and trace?

28:10.220 --> 28:11.820
They never stay on the
phone long enough for that.

28:11.860 --> 28:13.630
Dave, they're a lot faster
than they used to be.

28:13.670 --> 28:16.070
We also need to prep the
detective on what to say to him.

28:16.110 --> 28:17.950
He's not gonna want to
talk to the detective.

28:17.990 --> 28:19.640
He's gonna want to talk to the fbi.

28:19.680 --> 28:21.830
We don't step over the
local police like that.

28:21.870 --> 28:22.830
They called us in.

28:22.870 --> 28:24.340
Yes, but if the perception is that

28:24.380 --> 28:27.690
we're to embarrass the locals by telling
the media that we're gonna fix things,

28:27.730 --> 28:29.360
then they'll stop calling us.

28:29.400 --> 28:31.240
Relax, hotch. I've got this.

28:31.280 --> 28:32.670
You see, that's the problem, dave.

28:32.710 --> 28:33.460
There is no I.

28:33.610 --> 28:35.960
We function as a team.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.520
I've been doing this before
you were out of high school,

28:38.560 --> 28:42.250
probably before the rest of
your team was in school at all.

28:42.290 --> 28:43.470
I know that.

28:43.510 --> 28:45.140
Things have changed.

28:45.180 --> 28:46.730
The bells and whistles changed.

28:46.770 --> 28:49.900
An unsub is still an unsub, and
I know how to deal with an unsub.

28:49.940 --> 28:52.140
- No, dave, it's not just that.
- Hotch.

28:52.180 --> 28:53.250
What?

28:53.290 --> 28:55.210
Garcia found something.

29:05.540 --> 29:07.410
Garcia, talk to us.

29:07.450 --> 29:10.420
So, michelle colucci
recently drew up the plans

29:10.460 --> 29:14.720
for a remodel of 3 floors of a
company called techco communications.

29:14.760 --> 29:18.660
It's a high-tech communications
company in downtown dallas.

29:18.700 --> 29:20.460
And enid white?

29:20.890 --> 29:23.290
Worked there until 2 months ago.

29:28.980 --> 29:30.430
He's on 2.

29:30.470 --> 29:31.440
The unsub?

29:31.480 --> 29:33.840
Demanded to speak to the fbi.

29:39.590 --> 29:43.810
This is fbi supervisory
special agent david rossi.

29:44.970 --> 29:46.870
You called me impotent.

29:46.910 --> 29:48.720
Did I?

29:49.230 --> 29:51.990
I'm not impotent.

29:52.190 --> 29:53.810
Why are you whispering?

29:53.850 --> 29:55.500
You lied.

29:55.540 --> 29:57.430
You lied.

29:57.960 --> 29:59.540
Is someone around you?

29:59.580 --> 30:01.160
Are you at work?

30:01.360 --> 30:03.700
You have to tell the news the truth.

30:03.740 --> 30:06.330
I'll get you on the news, then
you can correct me yourself.

30:06.370 --> 30:10.290
No, you, you, you correct it.

30:10.330 --> 30:13.840
By the way, I was, um, looking
at the police security tapes

30:13.880 --> 30:18.190
for the day michelle
colucci went missing.

30:18.230 --> 30:19.490
What?

30:19.530 --> 30:22.950
You watched her long enough to
know she didn't have visitors.

30:22.990 --> 30:24.450
She was a loner.

30:24.490 --> 30:28.580
Yet you knew that detective
yarbrough was coming over.

30:28.620 --> 30:34.070
You must have been right here
in this station when he told her.

30:34.930 --> 30:39.760
Now, your face is gonna be on one
of those tapes, and when I find it,

30:39.800 --> 30:44.100
I'm gonna paper this city with
it, just like you did with those women.

30:44.140 --> 30:46.110
Everyone will see it.

30:46.150 --> 30:48.790
They won't be able to ignore you now.

30:48.830 --> 30:54.390
But you won't inspire fear, you'll
inspire hatred and ridicule,

30:54.430 --> 30:58.350
because the only power
someone like you has is a mask,

30:58.390 --> 30:59.970
and once that mask is removed,

31:00.010 --> 31:03.340
you'll be as insignificant
as you've always been--

31:03.380 --> 31:05.630
a loser!

31:17.070 --> 31:21.050
You just signed enid
white's death warrant.

31:42.190 --> 31:44.440
Lieutenant, I need you to lock
the techco building down tight.

31:44.480 --> 31:46.840
Nobody in, nobody out. It's vital.

31:46.880 --> 31:50.120
Rossi, you really think the unsub's
still gonna be there after that call?

31:50.160 --> 31:52.240
Of course. He thinks he has
all the time in the world.

31:52.280 --> 31:54.760
You think they got an image off
the police security camera yet?

31:54.800 --> 31:57.450
The security camera doesn't
work. I lied about that.

31:57.830 --> 31:59.080
You lied about that?

31:59.120 --> 32:00.810
He doesn't know.

32:01.390 --> 32:03.180
Dave, that was incredibly reckless.

32:03.220 --> 32:05.190
Hotch, he didn't weigh
the body down well.

32:05.230 --> 32:06.280
What do you mean?

32:06.320 --> 32:07.960
He didn't want michelle
found so quickly.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.480
He screwed that up.

32:09.520 --> 32:11.350
This kind of guy, when
he plans something,

32:11.390 --> 32:15.690
if he has the time, if he's
in control, he's meticulous.

32:15.730 --> 32:19.490
But being on the edge of the river, out
in the open, he was not in control.

32:19.530 --> 32:22.220
He was in a hurry, and he made a mistake.

32:22.260 --> 32:23.750
That's what you're hoping.

32:23.790 --> 32:24.460
Trust me.

32:24.610 --> 32:27.800
With an unsub like this, you
need to throw him off his game.

32:27.840 --> 32:29.640
His hand needs to be forced.

32:29.680 --> 32:33.670
I know that, dave, but the point
is, you did it by forcing ours.

32:40.410 --> 32:42.010
- Is the building sealed?
- Top to bottom.

32:42.050 --> 32:44.450
Yarbrough, make sure it stays that way.

32:46.680 --> 32:49.900
Garcia, which floors did
michelle carlucci remodel?

32:51.550 --> 32:53.220
Got
it--7,8,9.

32:53.260 --> 32:54.250
Morgan, take 7.

32:54.290 --> 32:55.940
We're looking for a
rank-and-file employee

32:55.980 --> 32:58.800
who made a scene in the last
20 minutes or was here and gone.

32:58.840 --> 33:00.900
Prentiss,8, reid,9.

33:00.940 --> 33:02.490
Don't approach him. Just...

33:02.530 --> 33:05.180
try to get a name, maybe a picture.

33:08.650 --> 33:10.800
He's somewhere in this lobby.

33:11.170 --> 33:12.420
Why?

33:12.950 --> 33:14.850
Can't you feel it?

33:15.810 --> 33:19.460
Display your credentials. Fbi.

33:20.020 --> 33:23.050
He thinks we know what he looks like.

34:27.199 --> 34:28.570
Yeah, reid?

34:30.210 --> 34:31.739
Got him.

34:33.429 --> 34:34.909
Sir?

34:37.960 --> 34:39.400
Sir!

34:40.530 --> 34:42.360
Max pool.

34:45.060 --> 34:48.020
We have your address, max.
There's no place to go.

34:48.830 --> 34:51.179
This is agent rossi, max.

34:51.219 --> 34:54.489
If you do what you're thinking, you
won't get to tell them I lied.

34:54.530 --> 34:58.620
Come on, max, slowly put your
hands on top of your head.

34:58.660 --> 34:59.700
Listen to him, max.

34:59.740 --> 35:02.800
I know what you're thinking
and you don't have to do it.

35:02.840 --> 35:06.210
It doesn't have to end here, max.

35:06.250 --> 35:08.000
Please.

35:24.780 --> 35:26.790
Down!

35:40.720 --> 35:42.740
- You OK?
- Yeah.

35:43.680 --> 35:45.910
- He's gone.
- What about enid white?

35:45.950 --> 35:47.080
We have his home address.

35:47.120 --> 35:48.360
Is she there?

35:48.400 --> 35:50.160
Let's hope so.

35:59.620 --> 36:05.460
<i><u>"Home" by Chris Daughtry</u></i>

37:54.700 --> 37:59.080
You said out there, the
team shares everything.

37:59.120 --> 38:00.540
That's right.

38:00.580 --> 38:03.430
There is no I?

38:05.460 --> 38:08.930
It seems a big thing to withhold.

38:08.970 --> 38:12.610
Separating from your wife, your child.

38:12.650 --> 38:13.970
What are you talking about?

38:14.010 --> 38:16.550
You used to call haley 10 times a day.

38:16.590 --> 38:20.190
We've been together 48 hours, I
haven't seen you call her once.

38:20.230 --> 38:21.680
Haven't mentioned her.

38:21.720 --> 38:24.530
And you're not going home now.

38:24.570 --> 38:25.820
What's your point?

38:25.860 --> 38:29.940
I guess you're just not used to sharing.

38:29.980 --> 38:33.380
My private life is
not the same as a case.

38:33.420 --> 38:37.920
I'm just saying, sharing
is a learned skill.

38:40.040 --> 38:41.620
You know...

38:42.050 --> 38:44.250
when this all started...

38:44.550 --> 38:46.370
there were only a few of us.

38:46.410 --> 38:47.660
We'd go out on the road alone.

38:47.700 --> 38:50.980
We didn'T... groupthink.

38:51.020 --> 38:53.250
We don't groupthink.

38:53.290 --> 38:56.470
We think as individuals, and we share
the thoughts with the rest of the team.

38:56.510 --> 39:00.560
We don't write them down in a little
notebook and keep them to ourselves.

39:00.940 --> 39:02.460
Dave.

39:09.730 --> 39:14.630
All this-- the people we've
helped, the ones we've put away, it'S...

39:14.670 --> 39:17.030
because of you and the
guys who started this unit,

39:17.070 --> 39:18.830
who believed when nobody else did that

39:18.870 --> 39:22.750
there was a way of understanding
these crimes and getting ahead of them.

39:22.790 --> 39:23.890
And?

39:23.930 --> 39:27.230
I don't see that you
have anything to prove.

39:28.400 --> 39:30.290
You don't have to come back.

39:30.330 --> 39:32.430
I know that.

39:32.470 --> 39:34.540
So why?

39:37.620 --> 39:40.390
Maybe I have unfinished business.
