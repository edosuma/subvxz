WEBVTT

00:02.080 --> 00:03.479
WOMAN: HONEY, I KNOW, I KNOW.

00:03.520 --> 00:05.431
IT'LL ONLY TAKE 15 MINUTES.

00:05.480 --> 00:06.469
MAN: BUT IT'S AFI'ER HOURS.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.306
WELL, HE'S A NEW PATIENT.

00:08.350 --> 00:10.306
I HAVEN'T MET HIM YET,
BUT WHEN HE CALLED, HE--

00:10.350 --> 00:12.659
HE SOUNDED DESPERATE,
AT HIS WITS' END.

00:12.700 --> 00:14.656
AND I WAS ONLY
IN THE PARKING LOT.

00:14.710 --> 00:16.519
YOU'RE TOO NICE,
HONEY.

00:16.580 --> 00:18.445
THEY DON'T DESERVE YOU,
DR. UQALLA.

00:18.490 --> 00:19.661
THAT'S WEIRD.

00:19.710 --> 00:21.405
I THOUGHT I LOCKED
THIS DOOR.

00:21.450 --> 00:24.237
IT'S PROBABLY CALLIE.
YOU SAID SHE'S LAZY.

00:24.280 --> 00:26.328
NO, I SAID
SHE WAS FORGETFUL.

00:26.370 --> 00:30.454
LAZY, FORGETFUL,
THAT'S A THIN LINE
YOU'RE RUNNING WITH THERE.

00:30.500 --> 00:32.377
WELL, JUST GET HOME SOON.

00:32.420 --> 00:33.842
I WAS GONNA GRILL
SOME STEAKS.

00:33.900 --> 00:36.061
MAYBE YOU COULD PICK UP
A BO'I'I'LE OF WINE
OR SOMETHING.

00:36.120 --> 00:37.337
MICHAEL, I THINK
THERE'S SOMEONE HERE.

00:37.380 --> 00:40.338
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
LIKE THE CLEANING CREW?

00:40.380 --> 00:42.200
NO, IT'S PROBABLY JUST
SOME KIDS LIKE BEFORE.

00:42.250 --> 00:44.070
WHAT IF IT'S NOT?
STACY, GET OUT OF THERE.

00:44.130 --> 00:45.381
I'M GONNA CALL THE COPS.

00:45.430 --> 00:46.340
NO. IT'S FINE. IT'S FINE.

00:46.390 --> 00:48.699
I'LL JUST TAKE CARE OF IT.

00:50.310 --> 00:52.824
DON'T MOVE. DON'T MOVE.
I'VE ALREADY CALLED THE COPS.

00:52.870 --> 00:55.213
NO! NO! OH! AAH!

00:55.270 --> 00:57.966
MICHAEL: STACY!
STACY, WHAT'S HAPPENING?!

00:58.010 --> 01:00.228
STACY! TALK TO ME!

01:00.270 --> 01:02.352
ARE YOU OK?

01:02.410 --> 01:04.662
STACY, WHO'S THERE!

01:04.710 --> 01:07.577
STACY, I'M
CALLING THE COPS!

01:07.630 --> 01:09.109
STACY!

01:09.150 --> 01:10.754
WHERE IS IT?

01:10.800 --> 01:12.017
STACY, WHO IS THAT?

01:15.550 --> 01:17.677
ALVEZ: I--I DON'T KNOW.

01:17.720 --> 01:19.369
COME ON.
IT'S BEEN 3 MONTHS.

01:19.420 --> 01:21.206
YOU GUYS GOING STEADY
OR WHAT?

01:21.250 --> 01:24.071
WE'RE TRYING NOT TO PUT
LABELS ON ANYTHING.

01:24.120 --> 01:26.429
MM-HMM. SEE, YOU GOT
A GLOW, THOUGH.

01:26.470 --> 01:28.609
IT'S ALL OVER YOU RIGHT NOW.

01:28.650 --> 01:30.379
MEN DO NOT GLOW.

01:30.430 --> 01:32.478
LISA'S GOT A DRAWER
AT MY PLACE.

01:32.520 --> 01:35.045
OK. SO THIS IS GETTING
SERIOUS.

01:35.090 --> 01:37.479
SHE'S GOT ME THINKING
ABOUT NEXT STEPS.

01:37.530 --> 01:41.136
OH, ALL RIGHT. SEE, THAT'S
BECAUSE YOUR BIOLOGICAL CLOCK

01:41.180 --> 01:42.351
IS TICKING, MY FRIEND.

01:42.400 --> 01:45.699
OK. WHAT ABOUT YOU?
YOU SEEING ANYBODY?

01:45.750 --> 01:48.446
NO. NO. I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
NOT SINCE I BROKE OFF

01:48.490 --> 01:49.889
MY ENGAGEMENT TWO YEARS AGO.

01:49.930 --> 01:52.273
JUST NOT LOOKING
FOR A COMMITMENT RIGHT NOW.

01:52.320 --> 01:54.493
I NEVER SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT COMMITMENT.

01:54.540 --> 01:56.622
I GOT SOME SINGLE
ARMY BUDDIES THAT
I COULD SET YOU UP WITH.

01:56.680 --> 01:57.806
I AM NOT SAYING NO,
BUT I--

01:57.850 --> 01:59.329
YOU GUYS READY?

01:59.380 --> 02:01.189
UH, YEAH. HEY, IS REID
BACK FROM SABBATICAL?

02:01.250 --> 02:03.502
UH, NO, NOT YET,
BUT I JUST TALKED
TO HIM ON THE PHONE.

02:03.550 --> 02:05.245
HE SENDS HIS LOVE.

02:05.290 --> 02:07.429
I'M NOT SAYING NO,
BUT I DON'T DO BLIND DATES.

02:07.470 --> 02:09.461
I NEED PHOTOS.
PHOTOS.

02:11.560 --> 02:13.039
SO WHERE ARE WE
HEADED THIS TIME?

02:13.080 --> 02:17.039
WE ARE BACK
TO THE ENCHANTMENT
OF NEW MEXICO,

02:17.090 --> 02:18.387
WHICH, THE LAST TIME
I WAS THERE,

02:18.440 --> 02:19.657
WAS A LITTLE LESS
ENCHANTING

02:19.700 --> 02:21.304
AND A LITTLE MORE
CUCKOO BANANAS.

02:21.350 --> 02:23.955
NEVERTHELESS, WE PERSISTED.
THIS TIME WE'RE GOING TO TAOS.

02:24.010 --> 02:27.571
YESTERDAY, A 38-YEAR-OLD
PHYSICIAN NAMED STACY UQALLA

02:27.620 --> 02:29.440
WAS FOUND DEAD IN A CLINIC
WHERE SHE WORKED.

02:29.490 --> 02:32.402
SHE HAD A HOLE DRILLED
INTO THE LEFT SIDE
OF HER HEAD.

02:32.450 --> 02:34.054
WAIT. THERE'S MORE
DISGUSTING.

02:34.110 --> 02:36.670
LAST WEEK, STEVE KANTE,
40-YEAR-OLD HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER,

02:36.720 --> 02:38.017
WAS FOUND DEAD
IN HIS HOME.

02:38.070 --> 02:39.458
HE WAS FOUND
BY A CO-WORKER

02:39.500 --> 02:41.491
WHEN HE DIDN'T SHOW UP
AT WORK,

02:41.550 --> 02:43.415
AND LIKE STACY,
HE ALSO HAD
A HOLE DRILLED

02:43.460 --> 02:44.939
THROUGH THE LEFT SIDE
OF HIS HEAD.

02:44.990 --> 02:46.548
LAST YEAR WE HAD
A CASE IN FLORIDA.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.376
THE GUY GAVE HIS VICTIMS
CHEMICAL LOBOTOMIES.

02:49.430 --> 02:50.636
HE USED A DRILL
AS WELL.

02:50.690 --> 02:52.772
BUT THE PLACEMENT HERE,
SIDE OF THE HEAD,

02:52.820 --> 02:54.469
IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

02:54.520 --> 02:56.476
YOU KNOW, THERE WAS
A FAMOUS EXPERIMENT
IN THE SIXTIES.

02:56.520 --> 02:59.899
A DUTCH PROFESSOR
BELIEVED HE COULD INDUCE
A PERMANENT HIGH

02:59.960 --> 03:02.827
BY DRILLING A SMALL HOLE
IN THE SKULL.

03:02.870 --> 03:04.599
YEAH, TREPANATION.
HUMAN REMAINS

03:04.660 --> 03:06.309
FROM AS FAR BACK AS
THE NEOLITHIC PERIOD

03:06.360 --> 03:07.566
HAVE SHOWN EVIDENCE
OF SUCH DRILLING.

03:07.620 --> 03:09.224
IT WAS ONCE THOUGHT OF
AS A WAY TO RELEASE

03:09.270 --> 03:10.783
EVIL SPIRITS
FROM THE BODY.

03:10.840 --> 03:12.614
AND EVEN TODAY, SOME
PEOPLE STILL SEE IT

03:12.670 --> 03:14.444
AS A POSSIBLE AVENUE
TOWARDS HIGHER
CONSCIOUSNESS.

03:14.490 --> 03:17.573
OR THEY COULD JUST TRY
MEDITATION.

03:17.630 --> 03:19.018
YOU MEDITATE, ROSSI?

03:19.060 --> 03:22.541
OH, YEAH. 3 TIMES A WEEK
AND TWICE ON SUNDAY.

03:22.590 --> 03:25.844
TAOS ATTRACT S
AN INTERESTING WASH
OF TRANSPLANTS AND TOURISTS,

03:25.900 --> 03:27.765
PEOPLE TRYING
TO GET BACK TO NATURE

03:27.810 --> 03:30.199
OR FIND A MORE SPIRITUAL
EXISTENCE.

03:30.250 --> 03:32.718
SO, NO SHORTAGE
OF PEOPLE TRYING
TO BUY CRYSTALS, THEN.

03:32.770 --> 03:35.853
THIS GUY COULD BE
SOME TWISTED NEW-AGE MYSTIC.

03:35.910 --> 03:38.993
OR JUST SOME JOE CRAZY
SPIRALING OUT OF CONTROL.

03:39.040 --> 03:40.257
JJ: WELL, WHATEVER
THE REASON,

03:40.300 --> 03:41.551
TWO BODIES
IN SHORT SUCCESSION.

03:41.610 --> 03:43.566
FEELS LIKE THIS GUY'S
JUST GETTING STARTED.

03:43.610 --> 03:45.692
TAOS PD THINKS SO,
AND I AGREE.

03:45.740 --> 03:47.526
WHEELS UP IN 20.

04:21.600 --> 04:23.602
AAH!

04:31.480 --> 04:33.789
WHAT THE HELL?

04:33.830 --> 04:35.741
UHH!

04:35.790 --> 04:37.439
UHH! WHO ARE YOU?

04:40.750 --> 04:41.967
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

04:43.760 --> 04:45.751
OH, COME ON, MAN,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

04:45.800 --> 04:46.971
WHERE IS IT?

04:47.020 --> 04:50.456
I DON'T KNOW. WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

04:50.500 --> 04:52.673
WHOA, PLEASE.

04:52.720 --> 04:53.937
SOMEBODY HELP ME!

04:53.980 --> 04:55.538
AAH!

04:59.770 --> 05:01.374
WHERE IS IT?

05:01.430 --> 05:04.206
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
YOU WANT!

05:04.260 --> 05:06.558
DON'T DO THIS.

05:06.610 --> 05:08.259
YOU DID THIS
TO YOURSELF.

05:08.300 --> 05:11.474
NO! NO! AAH!

05:40.250 --> 05:43.333
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
ABC STUDIOS, LLC AND CBS, INC.

05:50.560 --> 05:52.699
ALVEZ: "CONVICT IONS ARE
MORE DANGEROUS FOES OF TRUTH

05:52.740 --> 05:56.301
THAN LIES."
FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE.

05:56.350 --> 05:58.306
STACY UQALLA WAS
A FAMILY PHYSICIAN,

05:58.350 --> 05:59.692
MARRIED, NO KIDS.

05:59.750 --> 06:01.399
SHE WAS BORN AND RAISED
IN TAOS.

06:01.440 --> 06:03.749
SHE LEFT FOR MEDICAL SCHOOL
BUT RETURNED LATER.

06:03.790 --> 06:06.668
JJ: STEVE KANTE, ON THE OTHER
HAND, MOVED TO TAOS AS AN ADULT.

06:06.710 --> 06:09.440
HE WAS DIVORCED
AND A HIGH SCHOOL
HISTORY TEACHER.

06:09.490 --> 06:11.139
HIS EX-WIFE NOW LIVES
IN MINNESOTA.

06:11.190 --> 06:13.454
SHE'S HAPPILY REMARRIED,
AND THE SPLIT WAS AMICABLE.

06:13.500 --> 06:16.230
LOOKS LIKE STACY AND STEVE
DIDN'T RUN IN THE SAME
SOCIAL CIRCLES.

06:16.280 --> 06:19.158
NO SIGN OF DISGRUNTLED
STUDENTS OR UPSET PATIENTS.

06:19.200 --> 06:21.543
YEAH. BY ALL ACCOUNTS,
THEY WERE BOTH WELL LIKED.

06:21.590 --> 06:24.150
GARCIA: TEAM, YOU KNOW
I WANT TO BE THE BEARER

06:24.200 --> 06:25.679
OF GOOD NEWS,
BUT LET'S FACE IT.

06:25.730 --> 06:27.721
WHEN YOU SEE THIS
GORGEOUS VISAGE ON THE JET,

06:27.770 --> 06:28.850
IT IS BOTH A BLESSING
AND A CURSE.

06:28.910 --> 06:30.423
WE HAVE ANOTHER VICTIM?

06:30.470 --> 06:32.904
YEAH. BEN MONTOYA.
HE'S A CONSTRUCTION WORKER

06:32.950 --> 06:34.770
FOR ADG BUILDERS.

06:34.820 --> 06:36.253
HIS BODY WAS FOUND
ON ONE OF THEIR SITES

06:36.300 --> 06:38.439
EARLIER THIS MORNING.
I'M SENDING YOU THE INFO NOW.

06:38.480 --> 06:41.438
M.O. IS AN EXACT MATCH
TO THE PREVIOUS
TWO VICTIMS.

06:41.480 --> 06:44.131
BEN WAS BORN AND RAISED
ON THE NEARBY JICARILLA
APACHE RESERVATION,

06:44.180 --> 06:45.829
BUT HE LIVED IN TOWN
WITH HIS WIFE

06:45.880 --> 06:46.835
AND THEIR 3-YEAR-OLD
DAUGHTER.

06:46.880 --> 06:48.268
THERE'S BEEN A SPIKE
IN HATE CRIMES

06:48.320 --> 06:49.799
IN THE US.
OVER THE PAST YEAR,

06:49.840 --> 06:51.091
AND BEN AND STACY BOTH

06:51.140 --> 06:52.448
HAD NATIVE AMERICAN BLOOD.

06:52.490 --> 06:54.094
WHAT IF THIS IS
RACIALLY MOTIVATED?

06:54.150 --> 06:55.799
WELL, IT COULD BE,
BUT THEN HOW DOES
STEVE FIT IN?

06:55.850 --> 06:57.579
IT SAYS HERE HE DEVELOPED
AN IN-DEPTH

06:57.630 --> 07:00.064
AND CONTROVERSIAL COURSE
ON NATIVE AMERICAN
LIVING HISTORIES.

07:00.110 --> 07:01.839
IT WAS POPULAR
WITH THE STUDENTS

07:01.890 --> 07:04.450
BUT NOT THE ADMINISTRATION
OR PARTS OF THE COMMUNITY.

07:04.510 --> 07:06.455
GARCIA, LOOK AT THE LATEST
VICTIM BEN MONTOYA.

07:06.510 --> 07:08.159
SEE IF HE CROSSED PATHS
WITH THE OTHERS.

07:08.210 --> 07:10.724
ON IT LIKE STUFF
ON THINGS AND WHATNOT.

07:10.770 --> 07:14.035
DAVE, LUKE, GO TO
THE LATEST CRIME SCENE.

07:14.080 --> 07:15.638
MATT, JJ, TALK TO THE M.E.

07:15.690 --> 07:18.033
TARA AND I WILL SET UP
WITH THE LOCAL PD.

07:22.130 --> 07:25.736
HI. KAREN CARLSEN,
CHIEF OF POLICE AROUND HERE,
BUT PLEASE CALL ME KAREN.

07:25.790 --> 07:27.872
EMILY PRENTISS.
THIS IS DR. TARA LEWIS.

07:27.920 --> 07:30.832
WE'VE GOT A QUIET PLACE
FOR YOU TO SET UP IN THE BACK.

07:30.880 --> 07:32.654
WHAT'S YOUR TAKE
ON ALL THIS?

07:32.710 --> 07:34.530
HARD TO SAY.

07:34.580 --> 07:36.707
WE'VE BEEN HIT
AS HARD AS ANYONE
IN THE LAST FEW YEARS.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.751
WE'VE SEEN A RISE IN
PROPERTY CRIME AND BURGLARY,

07:38.800 --> 07:40.404
BUT NOTHING THIS BRUTAL.

07:40.460 --> 07:43.452
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT
BRINGS A MAN TO DO
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

07:43.500 --> 07:45.809
WELL, IN OUR EXPERIENCE
THERE'S ALWAYS
AN EXPLANATION,

07:45.850 --> 07:47.898
EVEN IF IT ONLY MAKES SENSE
TO THE UNSUB.

07:47.940 --> 07:50.807
STACY UQALLA'S HUSBAND
IS WAITING
IN OUR FAMILY ROOM,

07:50.860 --> 07:53.112
AND BEN MONTOYA'S WIFE
IS IN MY OFFICE.

07:53.160 --> 07:55.299
WE DIDN'T WANT TO START
UNTIL YOU ALL ARRIVED.

07:55.340 --> 07:57.854
THANK YOU. WHY DON'T YOU
TALK TO BEN'S WIFE.

07:57.910 --> 07:59.298
I'LL SIT DOWN
WITH STACY'S HUSBAND.

07:59.340 --> 08:00.648
YEAH, RIGHT THIS WAY.

08:00.690 --> 08:03.909
ANNIE'S ONLY 3.
SHE WON'T EVEN REMEMBER HIM.

08:03.960 --> 08:06.178
BUT YOU WILL.

08:06.220 --> 08:08.563
AND YOU WILL KEEP
HIS MEMORY ALIVE FOR HER

08:08.610 --> 08:10.430
AS SHE GROWS UP.

08:12.230 --> 08:15.700
DEE, WE KNOW
YOUR HUSBAND GREW UP

08:15.750 --> 08:17.706
ON THE JICARILLA
APACHE RESERVATION,

08:17.750 --> 08:20.401
BUT WE NEED YOU
TO FILL IN THE DETAILS.

08:23.500 --> 08:25.718
BEN'S CHILDHOOD
WASN'T GREAT.

08:25.760 --> 08:27.887
HE SUFFERED A LOT
OF EMOTIONAL

08:27.940 --> 08:29.282
AND PHYSICAL ABUSE.

08:29.330 --> 08:32.197
WHEN BEN TURNED 18,
HE LEFT HOME

08:32.250 --> 08:33.933
AND HE NEVER LOOKED BACK.

08:33.990 --> 08:36.379
HE FOUND WORK
ON A CONSTRUCTION CREW,

08:36.420 --> 08:37.819
AND HE WORKED HARD.

08:37.860 --> 08:40.249
HE WORKED HIS WAY UP.

08:40.300 --> 08:44.646
I EVEN THOUGHT, NOT NOW,
BUT IN A COUPLE YEARS

08:44.690 --> 08:47.250
HE HAD A REAL SHOT
AT BECOMING A FOREMAN.

08:47.300 --> 08:51.828
IN A COUPLE OF YEARS.
WHY NOT NOW?

08:51.870 --> 08:54.521
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST MEANT THAT...

08:54.570 --> 08:59.007
DEE, I CAN SEE HOW PROUD
YOU ARE OF HIM.

08:59.060 --> 09:02.791
BUT WE NEED TO KNOW
EVERYTHING.

09:05.500 --> 09:08.628
MY HUSBAND HAD
A GAMBLING PROBLEM.

09:08.670 --> 09:13.892
BEN WAS IN RECOVERY,
BUT HE FELL OFF THE WAGON
LAST MONTH.

09:13.940 --> 09:18.673
HE OWED $25,000 ON CREDIT.

09:18.730 --> 09:22.370
WE DON'T HAVE
THAT KIND OF MONEY.

09:22.430 --> 09:24.773
MICHAEL: AND THEN
HE ASKED STACY,
"WHERE IS IT?"

09:24.820 --> 09:25.946
WHERE IS WHAT?

09:26.000 --> 09:27.649
I DON'T KNOW.

09:27.690 --> 09:29.089
THERE'S BEEN BREAK-INS.

09:29.130 --> 09:31.212
PEOPLE HAVE STOLEN DRUGS,
PRESCRIPTION PADS,

09:31.260 --> 09:34.559
BUT NOTHING LIKE THIS,
NOTHING SO...

09:34.610 --> 09:37.613
OK. MICHAEL, LET'S TAKE
A STEP BACK

09:37.660 --> 09:39.787
AND WALK THROUGH IT AGAIN.

09:39.840 --> 09:43.094
STACY STAYED LATE
BECAUSE A PATIENT CALLED HER

09:43.140 --> 09:44.664
AND ASKED TO BE SEEN.

09:44.710 --> 09:47.406
BUT SHE DIDN'T TELL YOU
WHO IT WAS, HIS NAME--

09:47.450 --> 09:48.701
SHE WOULDN'T.

09:48.760 --> 09:49.886
IT'S A HIPAA
VIOLATION.

09:49.930 --> 09:51.272
OF COURSE.

09:51.320 --> 09:53.106
BUT DID SHE GIVE YOU
ANY OTHER--

09:53.150 --> 09:55.015
MY WIFE IS DEAD,
AND WE'RE SITTING HERE

09:55.070 --> 09:57.026
TALKING ABOUT
CONFIDENTIALITY?

09:57.070 --> 09:58.970
I TOLD YOU THIS ALREADY.

09:59.030 --> 10:01.021
THIS MAN WAS LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING,

10:01.070 --> 10:02.594
SOMETHING SPECIFIC.

10:02.640 --> 10:03.948
WHY CAN'T YOU FIND HIM?

10:03.990 --> 10:05.685
WHY HAVEN'T YOU MADE
ANY PROGRESS?

10:05.730 --> 10:08.335
MR. UQALLA, WE'RE DOING
OUR BEST.

10:11.950 --> 10:13.349
MAN: IT LOOKS LIKE HE USED

10:13.390 --> 10:15.642
A 3/8-INCH HIGH-SPEED
STEEL DRILL BIT.

10:15.700 --> 10:17.429
COULD YOU TELL
IF IT WAS MODIFIED?

10:17.480 --> 10:18.731
NO, NOT THAT WE COULD SEE.

10:18.790 --> 10:20.917
THAT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE
TO TRACK.

10:20.960 --> 10:21.915
THING IS, THE KILLER
WENT THROUGH

10:21.960 --> 10:25.009
THE LEFT TEMPORAL LOBE, HERE.

10:25.050 --> 10:26.836
NOW, THAT AREA
CONTROLS A LOT.

10:26.880 --> 10:29.576
LANGUAGE, COGNITION,
BEHAVIOR, MEMORY,
AND HEARING.

10:29.620 --> 10:31.963
BUT PRIMARILY IT'S INVOLVED
IN AUDITORY PERCEPTION

10:32.020 --> 10:34.534
AND HOLDS THE PRIMARY
AUDITORY CORTEX.

10:34.590 --> 10:37.058
NOW, BASED ON MY EXAM
OF THEIR SKULLS,

10:37.110 --> 10:39.010
I BELIEVE THE VICTIMS
WERE ALIVE

10:39.070 --> 10:40.935
AS HE DRILLED INTO THEM.

10:40.980 --> 10:42.891
THE C.O.D. ON ALL 3
WAS THE SEVERING
OF THE BRAIN STEM.

10:42.940 --> 10:44.988
THE UNSUB WAS
IN COMPLETE CONTROL.

10:45.030 --> 10:46.895
HE COULD HAVE KILLED THEM
INSTANTANEOUSLY.

10:46.950 --> 10:49.020
SADISM 101. HE WANTED
THEM TO SUFFER FIRST.

10:49.080 --> 10:51.207
AND THIS GUY'S
CONSISTENT, TOO.

10:54.260 --> 10:57.218
SIMMONS: WOW. LOCATION,
THE ANGLE,

10:57.260 --> 10:59.342
THE DEPTH OF EACH WOUND,
THEY'RE NEAR MATCHES.

10:59.390 --> 11:00.732
YEAH, HE CAME IN
WITH A PLAN,

11:00.790 --> 11:02.473
AND HE EXECUTED IT
WITHOUT HESITATION.

11:02.530 --> 11:05.875
IF THAT'S NOT A MAN
ON A MISSION,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.

11:30.420 --> 11:33.810
ROSSI: LUKE AND I COULDN'T
FIND ANY FORENSIC EVIDENCE
AT THE CRIME SCENE,

11:33.860 --> 11:35.418
BUT WE DID TALK
TO BEN'S FOREMAN.

11:35.470 --> 11:37.938
HE SAID BEN WAS WELL LIKED
AND A HARD WORKER.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.991
YEAH, BEN'S WIFE
TOLD US SOMETHING SIMILAR.

11:40.040 --> 11:42.258
SHE ALSO SAID THAT BEN
HAD A GAMBLING PROBLEM

11:42.310 --> 11:44.699
AND OWED $25,000.
SHE DIDN'T KNOW TO WHOM.

11:44.740 --> 11:46.469
STACY'S HUSBAND
SAID THAT THE UNSUB

11:46.530 --> 11:47.952
WAS LOOKING FOR
SOMETHING SPECIFIC.

11:48.010 --> 11:50.308
MONEY? IS THAT WHAT
ALL THIS IS ABOUT?

11:50.360 --> 11:52.169
KAREN: YEAH, WE'RE LOOKING INTO
LOCAL BOOKIES AND LOAN SHARKS.

11:52.230 --> 11:53.834
THEY'RE MOSTLY
SMALL-TIMERS AROUND HERE,

11:53.880 --> 11:54.960
BUT WE'RE RUNNING DOWN
THE USUAL SUSPECT S.

11:57.620 --> 11:59.975
GARCIA, YOU'RE ON SPEAKER.
WHAT DID YOU FIND?

12:00.020 --> 12:01.976
SOME SHADE
OF THE SNARKY VARIETY.

12:02.020 --> 12:05.148
HASHTAG NO JUDGMENT,
BUT OUR FIRST VICTIM
STEVE KANTE

12:05.200 --> 12:07.282
LEFT BEHIND A WINDING TRAIL

12:07.330 --> 12:09.059
OF ODDLY TIMED CASH DEPOSITS.

12:09.110 --> 12:10.805
NONE OF THEM
ARE OF THE SAME AMOUNT.

12:10.860 --> 12:12.930
ALL OF THEM ARE UNDER
$10.000.

12:12.990 --> 12:15.288
SO HE KNOWS HOW TO STAY
OFF THE IRS' RADAR.

12:15.340 --> 12:18.207
CASH DEPOSITS
OF VARIOUS AMOUNTS
AT IRREGULAR INTERVALS.

12:18.250 --> 12:21.162
STEVE COULD HAVE BEEN
A BOOKIE ON THE SIDE.

12:21.210 --> 12:22.552
MAYBE EVEN BEN'S.

12:22.610 --> 12:24.123
I KNOW BOOKIES LIKE
TO SKIM OFF THE TOP.

12:24.170 --> 12:25.774
WHAT IF HE DID
AND GOT CAUGHT?

12:25.830 --> 12:26.990
MAYBE THAT'S
WHAT GOT HIM KILLED.

12:27.050 --> 12:28.438
WHAT ABOUT STACY?

12:28.480 --> 12:32.041
STACY HAD SOME TROUBLE
WITH HER STUDENT LOANS.

12:32.090 --> 12:33.614
WHEN SHE GOT OUT
OF MED SCHOOL,

12:33.660 --> 12:35.048
SHE DILIGENTLY TRIED
TO PAY THEM DOWN

12:35.100 --> 12:36.442
OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS.

12:36.490 --> 12:38.094
BESIDES THAT,
NOTHING STANDS OUT.

12:38.140 --> 12:39.186
MAYBE SHE SAW
SOMETHING
SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE

12:39.230 --> 12:40.959
AND SOMEBODY'S
AFRAID SH E'LL TALK.

12:41.020 --> 12:42.749
IT'S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE.

12:42.800 --> 12:44.279
LET'S FOLLOW THIS MONEY
TRAIL, SEE WHERE IT TAKES US.

12:44.320 --> 12:46.709
IT COULD LEAD US
TO SOME KIND OF ENFORCER.

12:46.760 --> 12:49.012
THAT'S ALL OF THEM.

12:49.070 --> 12:54.064
I NEED YOU TO GET ME
THE BUILDING BLUEPRINTS

12:54.120 --> 12:56.725
FOR EVERYTHING BETWEEN
ROUTE 68

12:56.770 --> 12:58.499
AND STATE ROAD 240.

12:58.560 --> 13:00.551
NOT A PROBLEM,
BUT YOU'LL NEED
WRITTEN PERMISSION

13:00.600 --> 13:03.160
FROM THE PROPERTY OWNERS,
COPIES OF THE GRANT DEEDS,

13:03.210 --> 13:06.509
AND THE LICENSED ARCHITECT
OR ENGINEER ON RECORD
FOR EACH OF THEM.

13:06.560 --> 13:08.949
YOU KNOW, IF YOU CALL
THE CITY, THEY'LL TELL YOU
HOW TO GET STARTED.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.218
NO, I NEED
THE BLUEPRINTS NOW.

13:11.260 --> 13:13.137
I UNDERSTAND THAT,
AND I WOULD LOVE
TO GIVE THEM TO YOU,

13:13.180 --> 13:14.135
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
BEFORE I CAN--

13:16.230 --> 13:18.960
SIR, YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN

13:19.010 --> 13:21.137
OR I'M GOING
TO ASK YOU TO LEAVE.

13:21.190 --> 13:24.444
EXCUSE ME, I NEED HELP
FINDING A BOOK.

13:24.490 --> 13:25.969
OF COURSE.

13:30.500 --> 13:33.151
RIGHT THIS WAY.

13:33.200 --> 13:35.668
I NEED YOU TO GET ME
THE BUILDING BLUEPRINTS

13:35.720 --> 13:41.545
FOR EVERYTHING BETWEEN
ROUTE 68 AMD STATE ROAD 240.

13:41.600 --> 13:43.852
I'M TALKING TO YOU.

14:00.620 --> 14:02.133
BYE.

14:14.540 --> 14:16.064
NO!

14:24.250 --> 14:26.115
SO ALMA HERNANDEZ
WAS LEAVING FOR THE NIGHT

14:26.160 --> 14:27.559
WHEN THE UNSUB FOLLOWED HER,

14:27.600 --> 14:29.943
CAME UP BEHIND HER,
THREW HER AGAINST HER CAR.

14:29.990 --> 14:31.810
BUT HE DIDN'T KILL HER.
WHY?

14:31.870 --> 14:34.213
TOO PUBLIC? MAYBE
HE NEEDED MORE TIME.

14:34.260 --> 14:36.034
ALMA'S FINISHED
WITH THE EMTs.

14:36.090 --> 14:37.341
PHYSICALLY SHE'S FINE.

14:37.390 --> 14:39.858
SHAKEN UP
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

14:39.920 --> 14:43.048
ALMA'S DEAF, AND I DON'T HAVE
A SIGN INTERPRETER OUT HERE YET,

14:43.090 --> 14:44.785
BUT SHE DOES READ LIPS.

14:44.840 --> 14:47.263
I CAN SIGN. I'M
HAPPY TO GET STARTED
IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

14:47.320 --> 14:48.924
OF COURSE.

14:48.970 --> 14:50.187
KAREN, YOU SAID
THE OTHER LIBRARIANS

14:50.230 --> 14:51.401
AND STAFF ARE STILL
INSIDE?YEAH.

14:51.450 --> 14:53.577
I'M GONNA TAKE A LOOK.

14:53.630 --> 14:57.191
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

14:57.240 --> 15:00.061
HE HELD YOU DOWN
ON THE TRUNK,

15:00.110 --> 15:03.022
PUT A DRILL
TO YOUR HEAD,

15:03.070 --> 15:07.370
BUT YOU TRIED TO SIGN
TO TELL HIM THAT
YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND.

15:07.420 --> 15:09.115
THAT YOU'RE DEAF.

15:10.640 --> 15:11.948
NO!

15:11.990 --> 15:13.514
NO!

15:13.560 --> 15:15.642
NO...

15:19.040 --> 15:22.168
DID HE SAY ANYTHING?

15:24.270 --> 15:25.999
YOU'RE LUCKY.

15:26.050 --> 15:28.132
HE SAID THAT
YOU WERE LUCKY?

15:28.180 --> 15:30.876
LUCKY HOW?

15:30.930 --> 15:33.273
I DON'T KNOW.

15:33.320 --> 15:34.446
BECAUSE I CAN'T HEAR?

15:34.490 --> 15:37.015
OK. SO HE DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING ELSE?

15:37.060 --> 15:39.756
HE ONLY TOUCHED
YOUR EAR?

15:46.510 --> 15:48.853
OK. THANK YOU, ALMA.

15:48.900 --> 15:50.800
YOU DID GREAT.

15:50.860 --> 15:53.556
YOU GAVE US
SO MUCH HELP.

15:53.600 --> 15:55.591
YOU'RE WELCOME.

15:55.650 --> 15:58.995
STAY POSITIVE, OK?

15:59.040 --> 16:00.951
OK. HEY.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.343
THANK YOU.

16:03.390 --> 16:06.086
LEWIS: SO I WAS TALKING
WITH THE HEAD LIBRARIAN
ELIZABETH TAPPIN.

16:06.130 --> 16:08.655
SHE'S BEEN WORKING
WITH A SKETCH ARTIST.

16:08.700 --> 16:10.088
SHE THINKS THE MAN
THAT ATTACKED ALMA

16:10.140 --> 16:13.007
ALSO SHOWED UP
AT THE LIBRARY EARLIER.

16:13.050 --> 16:15.439
HE WAS LOOKING FOR
BLUEPRINTS FROM
THE NINETIES.

16:15.490 --> 16:17.276
IF THIS GUY'S SOME KIND
OF ENFORCER,

16:17.320 --> 16:19.049
WHY DOES HE NEED BLUEPRINTS?

16:19.100 --> 16:20.829
WHAT'S HE LOOKING FOR?

16:20.890 --> 16:23.017
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

16:23.060 --> 16:26.279
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING
INTERESTING CAME UP
DURING MY INTERVIEW.

16:26.330 --> 16:30.027
WHILE ATTACKING HER,
THE UNSUB DISCOVERED
THAT ALMA IS DEAF,

16:30.070 --> 16:31.890
AND IT STOPPED HIM
IN HIS TRACKS.

16:31.940 --> 16:36.206
I THINK IT--IN HIS MIND
IT MADE HER AN INNOCENT,
YOU KNOW?

16:36.250 --> 16:38.684
SOME KIND OF A VICTIM.

16:38.730 --> 16:41.426
THE M.E. DID SAY
THE UNSUB WAS TARGETING

16:41.470 --> 16:43.256
THE AUDITORY SYSTEM
OF THE BRAIN.

16:43.300 --> 16:45.427
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT
THIS IS ALL ABOUT,

16:45.480 --> 16:47.607
DESTROYING HIS VICTIMS'
HEARING.

16:47.650 --> 16:49.993
IT'S THE ONE CONSTANT
IN EACH OF THESE KILLS.

16:50.050 --> 16:52.746
SO, PEOPLE WHO CAN HEAR
ARE AT FAULT.

16:52.790 --> 16:54.041
PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AREN'T.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.000
YEAH, BUT HEAR WHAT?

16:56.050 --> 16:57.608
I MEAN, WHAT DOES
THE ABILITY TO HEAR

16:57.660 --> 17:01.016
HAVE TO DO WITH MAPS
AND BLUEPRINTS
OF TAOS FROM THE NINETIES?

17:01.060 --> 17:02.539
A LOT, ACTUALLY.

17:02.580 --> 17:04.229
I THINK THIS IS STARTING
TO COME TOGETHER.

17:04.280 --> 17:06.009
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF A PHENOMENON

17:06.060 --> 17:08.108
INVOLVING LOW-FREQUENCY
SOUND WAVES CALLED THE HUM?

17:08.150 --> 17:10.289
I'M SURE MANY OF YOU
KNOW THAT THE HUM

17:10.330 --> 17:13.106
WAS FIRST REPORTED
HERE IN TAOS
IN THE EARLY NINETIES.

17:13.160 --> 17:15.242
JJ: IT'S BEEN DESCRIBED
AS A WHIR, A BUZZING SOUND,

17:15.290 --> 17:17.064
OR PERSISTENT RUMBLING.

17:17.120 --> 17:18.894
WE'VE BEEN DEALING
WITH THOSE HUM FOLKS
FOR YEARS NOW.

17:20.560 --> 17:22.243
SIMMONS: THAT'S TRUE,
BUT TAOS IS NOT
THE ONLY PLACE

17:22.300 --> 17:23.688
WHERE THE HUM
HAS BEEN HEARD.

17:23.730 --> 17:25.129
AND WORLDWIDE, VIOLENT
ACTS HAVE BEEN COMMITTED

17:25.170 --> 17:26.512
BY THOSE WHO CLAIM
TO HEAR IT.

17:26.560 --> 17:29.211
THAT'S RIGHT. IN 2013,
A MAN IN WASHINGTON, D.C.,

17:29.260 --> 17:30.431
KILLED 12 PEOPLE.

17:30.480 --> 17:32.175
NOW, HE CLAIMS
THAT HIS ACTIONS

17:32.220 --> 17:34.085
WERE DRIVEN BY AN
ULTRA-LOW-FREQUENCY ATTACK.

17:34.140 --> 17:36.176
ROSSI: AND JUST LAST YEAR
IN CUBA, DIPLOMATS

17:36.220 --> 17:37.869
WERE FORCED OUT
OF THE U.S. EMBASSY

17:37.920 --> 17:41.833
DUE TO ILLNESS BELIEVED
TO BE CAUSED BY A SONIC DEVICE.

17:41.880 --> 17:44.189
LEWIS: THERE IS A MEDICAL
CONDITION, CALLED MISOPHONIA,

17:44.230 --> 17:46.698
WHICH CAUSES ITS SUFFERERS
TO REACT WITH PANIC

17:46.760 --> 17:49.399
OR EVEN EXTREME RAGE,
AT EVERYDAY SOUNDS,

17:49.450 --> 17:51.532
LIKE CHEWING, HUMMING,
EVEN BREATHING.

17:51.590 --> 17:54.889
NOT EVERYONE WHO HEARS
THE SOUND IS GOING
TO REACT VIOLENTLY.

17:54.940 --> 17:56.805
BUT, GIVEN THE RIGHT
SET OF PRECONDITIONS,

17:56.850 --> 17:59.114
VIOLENCE IS ABSOLUTELY
POSSIBLE.

17:59.160 --> 18:00.240
PRENTISS: SO, WE NEED
TO FOCUS OUR EFFORTS

18:00.290 --> 18:01.336
ON PEOPLE IN THE AREA

18:01.380 --> 18:03.109
WHO HAVE REPORTED
HEARING THE HUM.

18:03.160 --> 18:05.628
ALVEZ: WE NEED TO RE-EXAMINE
OUR UNSUB'S EARLIER VICTIMS

18:05.690 --> 18:08.420
AND SEE IF THEY HAVE
ANY SPECIFIC CONNECTION
TO THE PHENOMENON.

18:08.470 --> 18:10.074
LEWIS: BASED ON EYEWITNESS
ACCOUNTS,

18:10.130 --> 18:12.735
WE KNOW WE ARE LOOKING FOR
A PHYSICALLY FIT ADULT MALE.

18:12.780 --> 18:15.214
SKETCH ARTISTS HAVE CREATED
A COMPOSITE OF THIS MAN'S FACE.

18:15.260 --> 18:17.603
THIS NEEDS TO BE
DISTRIBUTED FAR AND WIDE,

18:17.660 --> 18:19.139
TV, INTERNET, SOCIAL MEDIA.

18:19.180 --> 18:21.045
SOMEONE HAS SEEN THIS MAN.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.705
JJ: WE KNOW BECAUSE OF THE MAPS
AND BLUEPRINTS HE'S REQUESTED,

18:23.750 --> 18:27.004
HIS ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO FIND
THE SOURCE OF THIS HUM.

18:27.060 --> 18:29.574
SO TO THAT END, WE NEED
TO EXPLORE POSSIBLE TARGETS

18:29.630 --> 18:32.576
IN THE AREA, LOCATIONS
HE MAY BE DRAWN TO.

18:32.630 --> 18:33.972
ALVEZ: STARTING WITH THE AREA

18:34.020 --> 18:36.488
BETWEEN STATE ROAD 240
AND ROUTE 68.

18:36.550 --> 18:39.155
NOW, THIS UNSUB WILL NOT STOP
UNTIL HE FINDS THE SOURCE,

18:39.200 --> 18:41.156
AND ANYONE WHO GETS
IN HIS WAY IS IN DANGER.

18:41.200 --> 18:43.930
SO LET'S GET TO WORK.
THANK YOU.

19:29.550 --> 19:30.949
OOH!

19:30.990 --> 19:33.379
JAKE OWENS?
WHO ARE YOU?

19:33.430 --> 19:35.682
WELL, WE KNOW HE SOUGHT
HIS VICTIMS OUT.

19:35.730 --> 19:38.346
HE CALLED AND ARRANGED
FOR STACY TO COME BACK
TO THE CLINIC.

19:38.390 --> 19:40.472
AND SHE COULD HAVE TREATED HIM
OR FAILED TO TREAT HIM
IN THE PAST.

19:40.520 --> 19:43.307
HE ALSO WANTED BLUEPRINTS
FROM THE LIBRARIANS,

19:43.350 --> 19:44.829
AND WHEN THEY COULDN'T
GIVE THEM TO HIM,

19:44.870 --> 19:46.428
HE LASHED OUT,
ATTACKED ALMA.

19:46.480 --> 19:48.869
OUR UNSUB BELIEVES
THE HUM IS HOUSED
IN A PHYSICAL STRUCTURE,

19:48.920 --> 19:51.969
SO MAYBE HE THOUGHT THAT BEN,
BECAUSE HE WAS A BUILDER,

19:52.010 --> 19:53.352
HAD SOMETHING TO DO
WITH THE CONSTRUCTION.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.095
THAT STILL LEAVES
STEVE KANTE.

19:55.150 --> 19:56.538
HE STILL DOESN'T
FIT IN.

19:56.580 --> 19:58.628
HE WILL. WE JUST DON'T
HAVE ALL THE PIECES YET.

19:58.670 --> 20:00.058
BUT HERE'S THE THING.

20:00.110 --> 20:02.362
THIS PLACE DROVE
THE UNSUB MAD.

20:02.410 --> 20:04.287
THE EASIEST THING TO DO
WOULD BE TO MOVE.

20:04.330 --> 20:06.025
WHY DOES HE STAY?

20:06.070 --> 20:08.846
WHATEVER THE REASON,
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE
SIGNIFICANT,

20:08.900 --> 20:10.413
EXTREMELY PERSONAL.

20:10.470 --> 20:12.768
DO YOU THINK IT'S REAL,
THE HUM?

20:12.820 --> 20:14.629
REPORTS HAVE SURFACED
WORLDWIDE,

20:14.690 --> 20:16.499
WHICH MAKES ME THINK
THERE MIGHT BE
SOMETHING TO IT.

20:16.560 --> 20:18.289
AND OUR UNSUB THINKS
THAT IT IS,

20:18.340 --> 20:21.070
SO WE HAVE TO TAKE IT
AND HIM SERIOUSLY.

20:21.130 --> 20:24.384
THERE WAS AN INCIDENT
IN RUSSIA
IN THE FIFTIES

20:24.440 --> 20:26.863
THAT I THINK MAY BE
SIMILAR TO WHAT'S
HAPPENING HERE.

20:26.920 --> 20:28.820
THERE WERE 9 HIKERS
WHO WERE FOUND DEAD

20:28.870 --> 20:31.134
ON THE SIDE OF A MOUNTAIN
WITH NO APPARENT
MANNER OF DEATH.

20:31.180 --> 20:32.738
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

20:32.790 --> 20:34.655
WELL, THEY WERE FOUND
IN VARIOUS STATES
OF UNDRESS,

20:34.710 --> 20:36.268
SUBZERO TEMPERATURES.

20:36.320 --> 20:39.403
THEY HAD MINOR INJURIES,
BUT NO ONE COULD EXPLAIN

20:39.450 --> 20:41.406
WHY THEY DIED.

20:41.450 --> 20:42.883
A RECENT THEORY
TALKS ABOUT SOMETHING

20:42.930 --> 20:46.400
CALLED INFRASOUND,
IN THE FORM OF A VORTEX.

20:46.460 --> 20:50.282
VORTEX--THE REPEATING
PATTERN OF VIBRATIONS
DUE TO AIR FLOW?

20:50.330 --> 20:53.458
RIGHT. THE THEORY IS
THE HIKERS FOUND
THEMSELVES TRAPPED

20:53.510 --> 20:54.761
DUE TO BAD WEATHER,
BUT THEY WERE IN

20:54.810 --> 20:56.505
A NATURALLY OCCURRING
WIND TUNNEL.

20:56.550 --> 20:59.462
THOSE LOW-FREQUENCY
VIBRATIONS
BECAUSE OF THE WIND

20:59.510 --> 21:02.593
CREATED A VORTEX
WHICH IN TURN
TRIGGERED PANIC.

21:02.650 --> 21:04.345
THE HIKERS
WEREN'T JUST SCARED,

21:04.390 --> 21:05.641
THEY WERE DRIVEN MAD,

21:05.690 --> 21:08.955
DRIVEN TO THEIR DEATHS
BY THE SOUND.

21:11.480 --> 21:12.606
GO AHEAD, GARCIA.

21:12.660 --> 21:14.787
MMM. SO I'VE BEEN READING
MESSAGE BOARD

21:14.830 --> 21:16.434
AFTER MESSAGE BOARD,
AND LET ME TELL YOU--

21:16.490 --> 21:18.094
HOT TAKE--DON'T READ
THE COMMENTS.

21:18.140 --> 21:20.483
ALSO, I'VE DISCOVERED
SOMETHING CALLED NITRO
COLD BREW COFFEE.

21:20.540 --> 21:22.314
I THINK THE MILITARY
DEVELOPED IT

21:22.360 --> 21:24.055
TO KEEP SOLDIERS UP
FOR WEEKS AT A TIME--
FEELING GREAT.

21:24.100 --> 21:25.180
ALSO I HAVE A LEAD.

21:25.240 --> 21:26.275
OK, LET'S HEAR IT.

21:26.320 --> 21:27.457
HA HA. PUN INTENDED.

21:27.500 --> 21:29.320
SO THE NEXUS
OF THE LOCAL HUM HEROES

21:29.370 --> 21:31.418
IS A GUY NAMED TERRY ROSSETT.

21:31.460 --> 21:33.018
HE'S A SOCIAL WORKER
SLASH COUNSELOR,

21:33.070 --> 21:35.322
AND I CALLED HIM,
AND HE'S ON HIS WAY
TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

21:35.380 --> 21:37.029
THANKS, PENELOPE.

21:37.070 --> 21:38.890
AND, GARCIA, MAYBE
LAY OFF THAT COLD BREW.

21:38.940 --> 21:41.113
COOL STORY, BRAH. NEVER. BYE.

21:41.160 --> 21:43.333
THANKS FOR COMING IN.

21:43.380 --> 21:44.938
UH, WE UNDERSTAND
YOU WORK WITH PEOPLE

21:44.990 --> 21:46.332
WHO HEAR THE HUM.

21:46.390 --> 21:48.346
YEAH, I WAS SORT OF
THE FIRST GUY AROUND HERE

21:48.390 --> 21:49.778
TO TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY.

21:49.830 --> 21:52.344
MY GOAL HAS ALWAYS BEEN
TO GIVE THEM THE TOOLS

21:52.390 --> 21:53.789
TO DEAL WITH
THEIR AFFLICTION,

21:53.830 --> 21:56.469
SO WE TEND TO WORK ON
STRATEGIES OF MINIMIZATION

21:56.530 --> 21:58.350
AND THAT KIND OF THING.

21:58.400 --> 22:02.359
DO YOU RECOGNIZE
THIS MAN?

22:02.400 --> 22:04.356
NO.

22:04.410 --> 22:07.356
OK, WHAT ABOUT THESE 3?

22:07.410 --> 22:09.753
UM...NO,

22:09.800 --> 22:12.109
BUT THIS GUY,
I KNOW THE NAME.

22:12.150 --> 22:13.367
HOW SO?

22:13.410 --> 22:16.766
STEVE KANTE IS SOMETHING
OF A HOBBYIST.

22:16.810 --> 22:20.541
HE CONSTRUCT S WHAT HE CALLS
A HUM-CANCELING BOX.

22:20.600 --> 22:21.669
IT LOOKS SORT OF
LIKE A COFFIN.

22:21.730 --> 22:25.598
HE SELLS IT TO SUFFERERS
WORLDWIDE.

22:25.640 --> 22:27.198
DOES IT WORK?

22:27.250 --> 22:29.639
OH, I'D BE DAMN SURPRISED
IF IT DOES.

22:29.690 --> 22:30.941
BUT THESE ARE DESPERATE PEOPLE.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.479
HE'S PREYING
ON THEIR VULNERABILITY.

22:32.520 --> 22:34.511
THE BOXES AREN'T
EXACTLY CHEAP.

22:34.570 --> 22:36.913
WELL, IT EXPLAINS
STEVE'S CASH DEPOSITS

22:36.960 --> 22:38.473
AND OUR UNSUB'S ANGER
IF HE BOUGHT ONE

22:38.530 --> 22:39.952
AND IT DIDN'T WORK.

22:40.010 --> 22:42.399
YEAH. SO REPORTS
OF THE HUM HERE IN TAOS

22:42.440 --> 22:44.226
DATE BACK
TO THE EARLY NINETIES.

22:44.270 --> 22:46.875
WE BELIEVE OUR UNSUB IS
TRYING TO LOCATE THE SOURCE.

22:46.930 --> 22:48.795
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW ALL THIS GOT STARTED?

22:48.840 --> 22:51.400
TAKE YOUR PICK.
STONED HIPPIES,

22:51.450 --> 22:53.315
GOVERNMENT MIND CONTROL
EXPERIMENTS,

22:53.370 --> 22:55.759
UNDERGROUND
UFO BASES.

22:55.800 --> 22:58.360
HOWEVER, A FEW YEARS BACK,

22:58.420 --> 23:00.411
THE USGS DID A STUDY
OF THE REGION

23:00.460 --> 23:01.768
AND FOUND THAT THIS AREA

23:01.810 --> 23:04.461
DOES HAVE ELEVATED
ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD.

23:04.510 --> 23:05.898
JJ: THAT'S INTERESTING.
CAUSED BY WHAT?

23:05.940 --> 23:08.420
THE ELECTRICAL GRID
I THINK IS WHAT THEY DECIDED.

23:08.470 --> 23:11.382
SOMETHING ABOUT HOW
THE POWER LINES ARE ARRANGED.

23:11.430 --> 23:12.772
THAT MAKES SENSE.

23:12.820 --> 23:15.380
IT COULD BE WHERE
THE UNSUB'S HEADED TO NEXT.

23:21.310 --> 23:23.471
TURN THE POWER OFF
IN DISTRICT ONE.

23:23.530 --> 23:25.009
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

23:25.050 --> 23:26.608
IT'S THE SOURCE.

23:26.660 --> 23:30.005
SHUT. . .IT. . . DOWN.

23:30.060 --> 23:31.095
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

23:31.140 --> 23:32.402
SHUT IT DOWN!

23:42.150 --> 23:43.321
HURRY UP.

23:47.680 --> 23:49.807
PRENTISS: GUYS, I JUST SPOKE
TO THE CITY ENGINEER.

23:49.860 --> 23:51.282
HE SAID BACK IN
THE EARLY NINETIES,

23:51.340 --> 23:54.514
THE CITY RETROFITTED
THESE 4 SUBSTATIONS

23:54.560 --> 23:55.640
IN DISTRICT ONE.

23:55.690 --> 23:57.294
WE SHOULD SPLIT UP.

23:57.340 --> 23:59.035
WHAT THE HELL?

23:59.080 --> 24:00.957
WE'RE TOO LATE.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.048
IT'S OFF.

24:03.090 --> 24:04.569
I DID WHAT
YOU WANTED.

24:04.610 --> 24:07.431
QUIET.

24:09.360 --> 24:13.524
NO. NO, NO, NO.

24:13.580 --> 24:16.003
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

24:16.060 --> 24:17.482
NO. HEY!

24:17.540 --> 24:19.838
OHH! OHH!

24:21.540 --> 24:26.580
NO! NO!

24:26.630 --> 24:28.507
NO!

24:31.770 --> 24:33.670
AAH!

24:44.350 --> 24:46.511
DAMN.

24:46.570 --> 24:50.131
I'VE GOT MY PEOPLE
SECURING THE SCENE.

24:50.180 --> 24:51.784
WE SHOULD TAKE A LOOK
AT THE SECURITY FOOTAGE,

24:51.830 --> 24:53.354
SEE HOW HE GOT IN
AND OUT OF HERE.

24:53.400 --> 24:55.868
MAYBE WE CAN SEE HIS VEHICLE,
EVEN A LICENSE PLATE.

24:55.920 --> 25:00.220
ROSSI: JAKE OWENS.
HE'S AN ENGINEER
AT THE POWER PLANT.

25:00.280 --> 25:03.920
IT LOOKS LIKE THE UNSUB
USED THE SAME SIZE DRILL BIT,

25:03.980 --> 25:06.756
BUT THIS TIME HE STABBED HIM
SEVERAL TIMES IN THE NECK,

25:06.800 --> 25:08.199
CHEST, AND FACE.

25:08.240 --> 25:09.844
JAKE MUST HAVE REALLY
PISSED HIM OFF.

25:09.890 --> 25:11.676
HE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE
A CHANCE TO DEFEND HIMSELF.

25:11.720 --> 25:12.800
THIS GUY'S LOSING IT.

25:12.850 --> 25:14.192
OK, BUT WHY NOW?

25:14.250 --> 25:15.285
WELL, IF THE UNSUB THOUGHT

25:15.330 --> 25:16.467
THIS WAS THE SOURCE
OF THE HUM,

25:16.510 --> 25:17.727
HE'D NEED SOMEONE
LIKE JAKE

25:17.770 --> 25:19.294
TO HELP HIM
TURN OFF THE POWER.

25:19.340 --> 25:20.500
ROSSI: WHICH HE DID.

25:20.560 --> 25:22.460
BUT HE STILL SNAPPED
AND KILLED HIM.

25:22.520 --> 25:24.329
SO IT DIDN'T WORK.

25:24.390 --> 25:27.291
MY GUESS IS,
THIS IS HIS LAST, BEST HOPE.

25:27.350 --> 25:30.308
SO, WHERE DOES HE GO
FROM HERE?

25:30.350 --> 25:32.784
HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO
REBOOT HIS INVESTIGATION.

25:32.830 --> 25:35.788
WHICH MEANS WE'LL NEED
TO DO THE SAME.

25:38.620 --> 25:42.090
[HUFFING, MOANING,
DRILL WHIRRING]

25:58.730 --> 26:00.072
YEAH?

26:00.120 --> 26:01.155
YEAH. HA HA HA!

26:01.210 --> 26:04.509
OH, MY GOD.
TAOS IS BEAUTIFUL!

26:04.560 --> 26:06.596
OH, I JUST KNOW
WE'RE GONNA LOVE IT HERE.

26:06.650 --> 26:07.810
ME, TOO.

26:07.870 --> 26:09.770
I LOVE YOU.

26:22.620 --> 26:25.965
NO!

26:26.010 --> 26:27.830
NO!

26:29.630 --> 26:30.619
NO!

26:34.630 --> 26:37.588
I CROSS-REFERENCED
LOCAL PEOPLE

26:37.630 --> 26:38.494
WHO CLAIM TO HEAR THE HUM

26:38.550 --> 26:40.506
WITH THE 4 VICTIMS.

26:40.550 --> 26:41.767
I GOT 5 GUYS
WHO ARE A MATCH,

26:41.810 --> 26:43.892
BUT THEY ALL HAVE
SUPER SOLID ALIBIS.

26:43.950 --> 26:46.373
SO WE KNOW FOR A FACT
THAT OUR UNSUB IS MALE.

26:46.430 --> 26:50.127
AND WE'VE SPECULATED
THAT HE MOST LIKELY
HEARS THE HUM,

26:50.170 --> 26:52.991
BUT ONLY 2% OF
THE POPULATION CAN HEAR IT.

26:53.040 --> 26:56.305
SO WHAT IF HIS CONNECTION
TO ALL OF THIS WAS,

26:56.350 --> 26:57.647
I DON'T KNOW,
ONE STEP REMOVED?

26:57.700 --> 26:59.520
MAYBE SOMEBODY CLOSE
TO HIM HEARS IT.

26:59.570 --> 27:01.959
A PARENT,
A GIRLFRIEND, A WIFE.

27:02.010 --> 27:04.524
WHOEVER IT IS,
THEY MAY BE THE REASON
HE STAYED IN TAOS.

27:04.570 --> 27:07.482
OK, GARCIA, USE THOSE
SAME PARAMETERS

27:07.530 --> 27:08.667
BUT CHECK FOR WOMEN
THIS TIME.

27:08.710 --> 27:12.828
MAMA'S SYSTEMS
ARE UPGRADED AND PURRING.

27:12.890 --> 27:16.849
WHAT IF THIS IS
A MADNESS SHARED BY TWO?

27:16.890 --> 27:18.539
FOLIE A DEUX.

27:18.590 --> 27:20.672
WE'VE SEEN IT BEFORE
IN CRIMINAL PARTNERSHIPS

27:20.720 --> 27:22.153
WHERE TWO OR MORE PEOPLE

27:22.200 --> 27:25.545
SHARE THE SAME DELUSION
OR BELIEF SYSTEM.

27:25.600 --> 27:27.727
SIMMONS: YEAH, BUT WE KNOW
THIS GUY'S WORKING ALONE.

27:27.770 --> 27:29.590
DELUSIONAL DISORDERS
ARE COMPLEX.

27:29.640 --> 27:31.949
USUALLY WHEN TWO OR MORE
PEOPLE SHARE A BELIEF SYSTEM,

27:31.990 --> 27:33.423
IT'S BECAUSE
THEIR LIVED EXPERIENCE

27:33.470 --> 27:35.165
HAS BROUGHT THEM
TO THE SAME CONCLUSION.

27:35.210 --> 27:38.088
BUT I HAVE READ ABOUT CASES
WHERE A BELIEF WAS INDUCED,

27:38.130 --> 27:39.518
WHERE THE BELIEFS
OF ONE PERSON

27:39.570 --> 27:41.561
PENETRATE THE OTHER
AND CONSUME THEM.

27:41.610 --> 27:43.089
LIKE PASSING ON
A VIRUS.

27:43.130 --> 27:44.609
SO YOU'RE SAYING
MAYBE THE UNSUB

27:44.660 --> 27:46.560
COULDN'T HEAR THIS A YEAR AGO,
BUT HE CAN HEAR IT NOW?

27:46.620 --> 27:48.485
WITH THE AMOUNT OF RAGE
HE'S SHOWN,

27:48.530 --> 27:51.704
I'D BET ANYTHING
THAT HE HEARS IT NOW.

27:51.750 --> 27:54.014
I'VE GOT 3 WOMEN
WHO COULD BE A MATCH.

27:54.060 --> 27:56.278
FIRST ONE LIVES
OUT OF STATE.

27:56.320 --> 27:59.016
SECOND DIED 3 YEARS AGO
IN A CAR ACCIDENT.

27:59.060 --> 28:04.589
THIRD HAS POSTED A LOT
ON HUM HEARER MESSAGE BOARDS

28:04.630 --> 28:05.972
AND CHAT ROOMS.

28:06.030 --> 28:09.113
SHE ABRUPTLY STOPPED
POSTING ABOUT A YEAR AGO.

28:09.160 --> 28:11.628
HEY, HEY, HER LAST POST
WAS EXACTLY A YEAR

28:11.690 --> 28:14.500
BEFORE THE FIRST MURDER.
NO SIGN OF HER SINCE.

28:14.560 --> 28:16.858
HER DISAPPEARANCE
COULD BE HIS STRESSOR.

28:16.910 --> 28:18.423
OK, WHO IS SHE?

28:18.470 --> 28:20.813
UH, SARAH SANDS,
LOCAL SCULPTOR,

28:20.870 --> 28:22.474
MOVED TO TAOS 3 YEARS AGO

28:22.520 --> 28:23.862
TO BE AN ARTIST IN RESIDENCE
AT THE ART COLLECTIVE THERE.

28:23.910 --> 28:25.309
WAS SARAH MARRIED?

28:25.350 --> 28:27.739
YEAH. TO A CALEB SANDS.

28:27.790 --> 28:30.566
HE WORKS AT A SOLAR
PANEL COMPANY.

28:30.620 --> 28:33.134
SENDING HIS PHOTO NOW.

28:33.180 --> 28:34.522
WHOA!

28:34.580 --> 28:36.263
SIMMONS: THEY'RE A MATCH.
CALEB'S OUR UNSUB.

28:36.320 --> 28:38.185
WE NEED AN APB
OUT ON HIM IMMEDIATELY.

28:38.230 --> 28:41.279
HERE'S HIS WORK
AND HOME ADDRESS.

28:41.320 --> 28:43.322
THAN KS, GARCIA.

28:46.680 --> 28:49.365
SARAH: I NEED YOU TO
UNPLUG EVERYTHING.

28:49.420 --> 28:50.671
CALEB:
I ALREADY DID.

28:50.720 --> 28:51.630
WELL, BUT WHAT ABOUT
THE BLENDER?

28:51.680 --> 28:52.897
YES.AND YOUR ALARM CLOCK?

28:52.940 --> 28:55.465
IT'S IN A BOX
IN THE GARAGE.

28:55.510 --> 28:57.558
THE FAN.

28:57.600 --> 28:59.158
THE FAN IN THE BACK
BEDROOM.

28:59.210 --> 29:00.199
I CAN FEEL IT BUZZING.

29:00.260 --> 29:01.557
SARAH.

29:01.600 --> 29:02.737
IT'S LIKE IT'S POUNDING
MY HEAD

29:02.780 --> 29:04.429
FROM THE INSIDE OUT,
CALEB!

29:04.480 --> 29:06.289
IF IT'S GETTING WORSE,
MAYBE WE SHOULD TRY JUST--

29:06.350 --> 29:08.648
JUST TURN THE FAN OFF!

29:08.700 --> 29:10.179
HONEY, HONEY,

29:10.220 --> 29:13.690
WE GOT RID OF IT
TWO MONTHS AGO.

29:13.750 --> 29:15.479
DO YOU REMEMBER?

29:19.670 --> 29:21.535
NO.

29:21.580 --> 29:24.310
WHY CAN'T YOU
MAKE IT STOP?

29:26.500 --> 29:28.536
WHY CAN'T YOU
MAKE IT STOP?

29:28.590 --> 29:31.718
MAKE IT STOP.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.579
MAKE IT STOP!

29:33.640 --> 29:35.983
MAKE IT STOP! MAKE IT STOP!

29:36.030 --> 29:38.248
MAKE IT STOP!

29:40.600 --> 29:41.908
AAH!

29:41.950 --> 29:44.464
THERE AREN'T ANY MISSING
PERSON REPORTS FOR SARAH.

29:44.520 --> 29:46.203
IT'S LIKE SHE WAS HERE
ONE DAY, THEN VANISHED
THE NEXT.

29:46.260 --> 29:47.739
GARCIA,
WHAT DID YOU FIND?

29:47.780 --> 29:48.735
SARAH WAS AN ONLY CHILD.

29:48.780 --> 29:50.828
HER PARENTS DIED
A FEW YEARS AGO.

29:50.870 --> 29:52.258
SHE'S GOT NO EXTENDED FAMILY.

29:52.310 --> 29:53.698
WHY DIDN'T THEY
JUST LEAVE TOWN?

29:53.740 --> 29:55.048
THEY COULDN'T AFFORD IT.

29:55.090 --> 29:56.785
ALSO, CALEB WAS IN THE MIDDLE
OF A 3-YEAR CONTRACT

29:56.830 --> 29:58.263
WITH THE COMPANY
HE WORKED FOR.

29:58.310 --> 29:59.618
WHAT ABOUT HER FRIENDS?
WHAT DO THEY SAY?

29:59.660 --> 30:01.264
APPARENTLY CALEB
WROTE THEM

30:01.320 --> 30:04.278
SAYING SARAH HAD LEFT TOWN
TO GET THE HELP SHE NEEDED

30:04.320 --> 30:07.494
AND ANY CONTACT WOULD, QUOTE,
"THREATEN HER RECOVERY."

30:07.540 --> 30:09.314
THREATEN IS AN INTERESTING
WORD TO USE.

30:09.370 --> 30:11.497
IT FEELS LIKE
HE'S COVERING SOMETHING UP.

30:11.540 --> 30:12.848
ROSSI: IT SURE DOES.
MAYBE SARAH LEFT HIM

30:12.890 --> 30:14.892
AND CALEB HAD
A DIFFICULT TIME
ADMITTING IT.

30:14.940 --> 30:16.976
OR, AND I HATE TO SAY IT,
SHE'S DEAD.

30:17.030 --> 30:18.679
WHAT IF SARAH
WAS HIS FIRST VICTIM?

30:18.720 --> 30:20.597
BUT I HAVE NO DEATH
CERTIFICATE FOR MRS. SANDS.

30:20.640 --> 30:21.982
STILL...AT ANY POINT,

30:22.030 --> 30:24.294
DID SARAH'S POSTS
START TO SHIFT?

30:24.340 --> 30:27.207
GARCIA: YEAH. ABOUT 4 MONTHS
BEFORE SHE DISAPPEARED,

30:27.260 --> 30:31.128
THEY START BEING MORE
FULL OF PAIN AND FEAR
AND DESPERATION.

30:31.170 --> 30:33.252
I KEEP THINKING ABOUT
CALEB'S CHOICE OF WEAPON.

30:33.300 --> 30:34.779
IT'S SO SPECIFIC.

30:34.830 --> 30:36.434
GARCIA, DID SARAH
MENTION A DRILL?

30:36.480 --> 30:38.823
NOT SPECIFICALLY, BUT--

30:38.880 --> 30:40.825
WHOA, CHECK THIS OUT.
A MONTH BEFORE SHE VANISHED,

30:40.880 --> 30:42.529
SHE POSTED THIS:

30:42.570 --> 30:44.743
"I WONDER HOW MUCH MORE
OF THIS I CAN TAKE.

30:44.790 --> 30:46.746
THERE HAS TO BE A WAY
I CAN MAKE IT STOP."

30:46.800 --> 30:49.098
A PRETTY OBVIOUS
CRY FOR HELP.

30:49.150 --> 30:50.924
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE ABOUT
TWO MINUTES OUT
FROM CALEB'S HOUSE.

30:50.970 --> 30:52.847
GREAT. WE'RE LANDING
AT HIS OFFICE IN 5.

30:52.890 --> 30:54.050
CIRCLE BACK
AS SOON AS YOU CAN.

30:59.850 --> 31:01.852
SARAH?

31:07.950 --> 31:09.679
OH, MY GOD.

31:09.730 --> 31:12.335
SARAH!

31:43.330 --> 31:46.197
MAN: HONEY? BABE.

31:48.290 --> 31:50.338
BABE, WILL YOU GRAB
MY BOOK FOR ME?

31:50.380 --> 31:52.245
IT'S BY THE BED.

31:54.120 --> 31:55.815
DO YOU SEE
THE SITUATION?

31:55.870 --> 31:57.258
I'M 7 MONTHS PREGNANT.

31:57.300 --> 31:59.256
I'M NOT WADDLING BACK
THERE TO GET A BOOK.

31:59.300 --> 32:00.949
OH, YEAH. I TOTALLY FORGOT.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.309
I MUST HAVE SLEPT THROUGH
THE LAST 6 MONTHS.

32:03.350 --> 32:05.341
MM. AND YOU'RE GONNA SLEEP
FOR THE NEXT 6 MONTHS

32:05.400 --> 32:06.742
KEEP ASKING ME
TO DO ANYTHING

32:06.790 --> 32:08.178
OTHER THAN HAVE
THIS CHILD OF YOURS.

32:10.010 --> 32:12.524
Hey, I hope
you're not as stubborn
as your mom.

32:15.230 --> 32:16.276
AAH!

32:16.320 --> 32:18.311
AAH! AAH!

32:18.370 --> 32:20.270
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
WHO ARE YOU?

32:22.150 --> 32:24.846
PRENTISS AND ROSSI
SEARCHED CALEB'S APARTMENT.

32:24.890 --> 32:26.846
THEY FOUND THE DRILL
AND TONS OF EVIDENCE,

32:26.900 --> 32:28.288
BUT CALEB'S NOWHERE
TO BE SEEN.

32:28.330 --> 32:30.025
SO WE STRUCK OUT
ON ALL FRONTS.

32:30.070 --> 32:32.334
OK, LET'S JUST THINK
ABOUT THIS FOR A SECOND.

32:32.380 --> 32:34.814
OUR UNSUB SHUT THE POWER
DOWN IN DISTRICT ONE,

32:34.860 --> 32:36.646
BUT HE DOESN'T LIVE
IN DISTRICT ONE.

32:36.690 --> 32:39.158
MAYBE HE DID ONCE
WITH SARAH.

32:39.210 --> 32:42.293
THIS COULD BE
WHERE SHE STARTED
HEARING THE NOISE.

32:42.350 --> 32:44.818
TALK TO ME WITH YOUR FACE,
TARA LEWIS.

32:44.870 --> 32:46.303
GARCIA, WE NEED YOU
TO DO SOME MORE DIGGING.

32:46.350 --> 32:49.046
I WAS BORN WITH A SHOVEL
IN MY HAND. NO, A BACKHOE.

32:49.090 --> 32:51.308
OK, LOOK, WE KNOW
CALEB AND SARAH

32:51.360 --> 32:52.748
COULDN'T LEAVE TOWN,

32:52.790 --> 32:54.576
BUT WHAT IF THEY
MOVED AROUND INSIDE OF TOWN,

32:54.620 --> 32:56.394
MAYBE IN AN ATTEMPT
TO ESCAPE THE HUM?

32:56.450 --> 32:58.964
YEAH. WE KNOW THAT
THEY HAD TO LIVE
INSIDE DISTRICT ONE

32:59.020 --> 33:00.055
AT SOME POINT.

33:00.100 --> 33:01.271
OK, I'M LOOKING.

33:01.320 --> 33:03.231
I AM LOOKING
AND THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN SEE.

33:03.280 --> 33:05.498
NO, WAIT! NO!
I CAN SEE IT, I CAN SEE IT!

33:05.540 --> 33:07.679
OK. THE ART COLLECTIVE
SARAH WORKED FOR

33:07.720 --> 33:09.233
OWNS A HOUSE
IN DISTRICT ONE,

33:09.290 --> 33:10.632
AND THAT HOUSE WAS PROVIDED
TO ARTISTS IN RESIDENCE

33:10.680 --> 33:12.159
AND SARAH WAS ONE OF THOSE.

33:13.810 --> 33:15.334
THE HOUSE WASN'T
IN THEIR NAMES.

33:15.380 --> 33:16.893
THAT'S GOTTA BE IT.

33:24.210 --> 33:26.474
CALEB'S INSIDE.
THE DOOR'S BEEN BUSTED IN.

33:26.520 --> 33:28.169
DISPATCH SAYS HOMEOWNERS
HAVEN'T ANSWERED OUR CALLS.

33:28.220 --> 33:29.175
HOPEFULLY WE'RE NOT TOO LATE.

33:29.220 --> 33:30.699
SET UP A PERIMETER.

33:30.740 --> 33:32.298
WE'RE GOING TO NEED BACKUP
WITH EMTs STANDING BY.

33:32.350 --> 33:33.430
THERE'S NO TELLING
WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE.

33:33.480 --> 33:35.038
CALEB JUST WANTS
TO BE HEARD, VALIDATED.

33:35.100 --> 33:36.874
I'LL GET HIM TALKING.
WE'LL GO FROM THERE.

33:36.920 --> 33:38.000
TAKE WHATEVER YOU WANT.

33:38.050 --> 33:39.927
DON'T--DON'T HURT US.

33:39.970 --> 33:41.096
PLEASE, PLEASE.

33:41.140 --> 33:43.279
UHH! IT'S HERE!

33:43.320 --> 33:46.926
UHH! I KNOW IT IS! UHH!

33:46.980 --> 33:49.141
CALEB SANDS, FBI!

33:49.200 --> 33:50.360
PUT DOWN THE WEAPON.

33:50.410 --> 33:52.230
DON'T COME ANY CLOSER.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

33:52.290 --> 33:53.848
THIS IS WHERE IT IS.
IT HAS TO BE HERE.

33:53.900 --> 33:55.504
IT HAS TO BE.

33:55.550 --> 33:58.371
THIS IS WHERE
SHE WAS INFECTED.

33:58.420 --> 33:59.375
I HAVE TO FIND IT.

33:59.420 --> 34:00.330
ALVEZ:
PUT THE AX DOWN.

34:00.380 --> 34:01.460
STOP RIGHT THERE!

34:01.510 --> 34:03.774
TARA: OK.

34:03.820 --> 34:06.334
OK.

34:06.390 --> 34:09.996
WE KNOW ABOUT
THE HUM, CALEB,

34:10.040 --> 34:12.952
AND ABOUT YOUR WIFE
SARAH?

34:15.310 --> 34:17.392
WE KNOW YOU DID
EVERYTHING YOU COULD.

34:17.440 --> 34:20.170
EAR PLUGS, SOUND MACHINES,

34:20.230 --> 34:21.310
DOCTORS,

34:21.360 --> 34:23.999
STEVE KANTE'S BOX.

34:24.060 --> 34:26.881
BUT NOTHING HELPED.

34:26.930 --> 34:29.319
YOU

34:29.370 --> 34:31.099
YOU CAN HEAR IT, RIGHT?

34:31.150 --> 34:32.321
HEY!

34:32.370 --> 34:34.418
LEWIS: CALEB, I KNOW
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE

34:34.460 --> 34:36.109
TO WATCH SOMEONE
SLIP AWAY,

34:36.160 --> 34:37.411
TO FEEL POWERLESS

34:37.460 --> 34:40.805
AS THEY LOSE THEIR GRIP
ON THEMSELVES

34:40.860 --> 34:43.465
AND ON YOU AND ON REALITY.

34:43.510 --> 34:45.466
AND SUDDENLY, EVERYTHING
YOU EVER PLANNED FOR,

34:45.510 --> 34:48.775
EVERYTHING YOU EVER WANTED,
IS ON HOLD,

34:48.820 --> 34:52.472
CONSUMED BY THEIR NEEDS
AND THEIR ILLNESS.

34:52.520 --> 34:56.217
AND THE WORST PART ABOUT IT
IS THERE'S NO WAY OUT.

34:56.260 --> 34:59.309
THAT'S WHAT
IT FEELS LIKE, RIGHT?

34:59.350 --> 35:02.433
YOU'VE BEEN TRAPPED HERE
FOR THE PAST YEAR,

35:02.490 --> 35:04.481
EVER SINCE SARAH
DISAPPEARED.

35:04.530 --> 35:08.409
I WANTED TO HELP HER,

35:08.450 --> 35:09.929
AND I COULDN'T.

35:09.970 --> 35:12.530
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW.

35:12.580 --> 35:14.104
AND THEN SHE WAS GONE.

35:14.150 --> 35:16.015
SHE WAS GONE.

35:16.070 --> 35:19.016
SHE DIDN'T LEAVE...RIGHT?

35:19.070 --> 35:21.379
SHE DIDN'T.
SHE DIDN'T RUN AWAY.

35:21.420 --> 35:23.547
IT ALL GOT TO BE
TOO MUCH.

35:23.590 --> 35:26.286
SO SHE ENDED IT.

35:26.340 --> 35:28.467
IT WAS THIS PLACE.

35:28.510 --> 35:33.459
THIS PLACE KILLED HER.

35:33.520 --> 35:35.169
WE NEVER SHOULD HAVE
COME HERE.

35:35.220 --> 35:36.642
I KNOW YOU LOVED HER.

35:36.690 --> 35:39.341
OK. I KNOW YOU NEVER
WOULD HAVE HURT HER.

35:39.390 --> 35:42.780
YOU TOOK CARE OF HER.

35:42.830 --> 35:45.526
YOU WRAPPED HER UP.

35:45.570 --> 35:47.356
YOU BURIED HER.

35:51.670 --> 35:55.492
I WANTED TO BELIEVE HER.

35:55.540 --> 35:57.883
BUT I COULDN'T HEAR IT.

35:57.930 --> 36:00.751
I COULDN'T HEAR IT...

36:00.810 --> 36:02.880
UNTIL SHE DIED.

36:02.940 --> 36:07.377
CALEB, YOU HAVE TO
GIVE ME THE AX.

36:09.470 --> 36:14.772
NOW...IT'S ALL I CAN HEAR.

36:14.820 --> 36:17.687
SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE
WANTED THIS.

36:17.740 --> 36:21.608
SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE
WANTED YOU TO HURT
THESE INNOCENT PEOPLE.

36:23.740 --> 36:26.265
I KNOW YOU TRIED
TO HELP HER.

36:26.310 --> 36:29.916
YOU FEEL GUILTY THAT
YOU DIDN'T DO MORE,

36:29.970 --> 36:34.873
BUT IT'S TIME
TO LET GO, OK?

36:34.930 --> 36:36.830
IT'S TIME
TO LET SARAH GO.

36:48.460 --> 36:52.988
NOW ALL I CAN HEAR IS...

36:53.030 --> 36:57.421
THE SOUND OF THAT DRILL
AND OF HER SCREAMING.

36:57.470 --> 37:00.860
SHE'S...SHE'S...

37:00.910 --> 37:02.389
OF HER SCREAMING.

37:02.430 --> 37:06.252
MAN: IT'S OK. IT'S OK.
IT'S OVER.

37:06.310 --> 37:07.652
IT'S OK.
I LOVE YOU.

37:07.700 --> 37:12.000
HEY. YOU GUYS
ALL RIGHT?

37:12.050 --> 37:14.484
KAREN: COME ON, LET'S
GET YOU CHECKED OUT.

37:23.110 --> 37:24.919
LEWIS: "HOLDING ON
IS BELIEVING

37:24.980 --> 37:26.663
"THAT THERE'S ONLY A PAST.

37:26.720 --> 37:29.143
LETTING GO IS KNOWING
THAT THERE'S A FUTURE."

37:29.200 --> 37:32.328
DAPHNE ROSE KINGMA.

37:32.380 --> 37:35.986
ALVEZ: I MEAN, CAN YOU IMAGINE
BEING DRIVEN MAD

37:36.030 --> 37:37.816
BY A SINGLE SOUND?

37:37.860 --> 37:41.512
SIMMONS: THE SOUND OF A FORK
SCRAPING AGAINST METAL

37:41.560 --> 37:43.255
MAKES MY SKIN CRAWL.

37:43.300 --> 37:44.642
JJ: WILL SINGS IN THE SHOWER.

37:44.690 --> 37:47.033
NINETIES ALT-ROCK.

37:47.090 --> 37:48.216
OH, MY GOD.

37:48.260 --> 37:50.046
IT WOULD DRIVE ANYONE CRAZY.

37:50.090 --> 37:52.524
THE WAY ROSSI SWIRLS
HIS WHISKEY,

37:52.570 --> 37:56.301
ICE CUBES CLINKING
AGAINST THE SIDE
OF THE GLASS.

37:56.360 --> 37:58.658
I KNOW, THE FINER
THINGS IN LIFE.

37:58.710 --> 38:00.792
ROSSI: HAVE I EVER TOLD
YOU ABOUT THE TIME

38:00.840 --> 38:03.354
I WAS HAVING DRINKS
WITH THE KING OF SWEDEN?

38:03.410 --> 38:05.833
WHAT? OK, WAIT. THE LAST TIME
YOU TOLD THIS STORY,

38:05.890 --> 38:10.099
WASN'T IT THE, UH,
THE MAYOR OF STOCKHOLM?

38:10.150 --> 38:11.674
PRENTISS: YEAH, YOU LOST
20 GRAND THAT NIGHT.

38:11.720 --> 38:12.539
20 GRAND?

38:12.590 --> 38:13.625
FOLIE A DEUX.

38:13.680 --> 38:15.716
YOU REALLY CONNECTED
WITH HIM.

38:15.770 --> 38:19.024
YEAH. THAN KS.

38:22.900 --> 38:25.721
HOW'D YOU COME UP
WITH THAT?

38:25.780 --> 38:27.998
EXPERIENCE.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.343
UM--

38:33.480 --> 38:35.254
BEFORE I WAS ENGAGED
TO DOUGLAS,

38:35.310 --> 38:36.789
I WAS MARRIED ONCE.

38:36.830 --> 38:38.695
MY HUSBAND AND I
WERE BOTH IN GRAD SCHOOL,

38:38.750 --> 38:41.173
AND WE--WE REALLY STRUGGLED.

38:41.230 --> 38:44.927
I WAS TEACHING,
HE WAS WRITING HIS THESIS

38:44.970 --> 38:48.315
AND WORKING NIGHTS, AND...

38:48.360 --> 38:50.442
HE STARTED TAKING UPPERS
TO STAY AWAKE.

38:50.500 --> 38:53.367
AND I JUST WATCHED HIM
TURN INTO SOMEBODY

38:53.410 --> 38:54.672
THAT I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE.

38:54.720 --> 38:57.416
BUT THE WHOLE TIME,
HE WAS CONVINCED

38:57.460 --> 39:01.157
HE HAD IT ALL UNDER CONTROL,
AND I BELIEVED HIM.

39:01.200 --> 39:04.590
AND WE THOUGHT THAT WE
COULD HANDLE HIS ADDICTION.

39:04.640 --> 39:10.419
THAT WAS OUR DELUSION,
OUR FOLIE A DEUX.

39:10.470 --> 39:12.938
BY THE TIME WE GOT HELP,

39:13.000 --> 39:17.380
WE JUST COULDN'T GET BACK
WHAT WE'D LOST. YOU KNOW?

39:17.440 --> 39:20.910
THE FUTURE THAT WE HAD
ONCE SEEN FOR OURSELVES
WAS GONE.

39:22.830 --> 39:24.388
I'M SORRY.

39:24.440 --> 39:27.261
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
A TOUGH THING
TO GO THROUGH.

39:27.320 --> 39:31.928
YEAH. WELL, IT'S NOT SOMETHING
I BRING UP AT DINNER PARTIES.

39:31.970 --> 39:35.019
ANYWAY. ..

39:35.060 --> 39:37.620
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
YOU'D BEEN MARRIED.

39:37.670 --> 39:38.750
WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW
ABOUT ME

39:38.810 --> 39:40.152
COULD FILL A BOOK,
MY FRIEND.
