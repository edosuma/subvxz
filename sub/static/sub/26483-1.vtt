01:05.720 --> 01:07.480
So, it says here that you were manager

01:07.560 --> 01:10.360
of the Rusty Scupper Restaurant
for five years.

01:10.440 --> 01:12.600
Hmm? Then, a bank teller

01:12.680 --> 01:17.243
at Bank of Oakland between 2014 to 2016?

01:18.760 --> 01:20.683
Oh! And you were employee of the month.

01:22.880 --> 01:25.520
What's that trophy in the bag there?

01:25.600 --> 01:29.680
Oh! Oakland High Moot Court Champion.

01:29.760 --> 01:31.000
I'm a salesman at heart.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.720
That is intriguing.

01:34.800 --> 01:38.088
Mainly... because I was the branch manager

01:38.200 --> 01:43.600
at the Bank of Oakland between 2014 and 2016.

01:43.680 --> 01:47.400
And you, Mr. Green,
you never fucking worked there.

01:47.480 --> 01:51.400
And the number that you gave to
The Rusty Scupper Restaurant?

01:51.480 --> 01:53.403
Is that your friend Salvador's number?

01:54.440 --> 01:57.649
The same Salvador who applied for this job?

02:02.520 --> 02:04.840
I didn't know he applied here, too.

02:04.920 --> 02:07.480
Might have been helpful
if his outgoing message

02:07.560 --> 02:10.199
didn't say, "It's Sal, bitches."

02:10.280 --> 02:13.560
This trophy and that plaque,
did you steal 'em?

02:13.640 --> 02:16.240
No, uh, I... made them.

02:16.320 --> 02:18.720
Well, I had them... made.

02:18.800 --> 02:22.361
Listen, I just really, really need a job.

02:23.760 --> 02:26.800
Okay, Cassius Green, listen up, okay?

02:26.880 --> 02:28.689
This is telemarketing.

02:30.280 --> 02:33.280
We're not mappin' the fuckin'
human genome here.

02:33.360 --> 02:35.840
I don't care if you have experience for this.

02:35.920 --> 02:37.400
I'll hire damn near anyone.

02:37.480 --> 02:39.800
You know what this bootleg trophy tells me?

02:39.880 --> 02:42.000
Tells me the only thing I need to know.

02:42.080 --> 02:44.447
You have initiative and you can read.

02:45.600 --> 02:50.000
You will call as many contacts
as you can during your shift,

02:50.080 --> 02:52.440
you will read the script that we give you,

02:52.520 --> 02:54.640
and you will show up tomorrow happy.

02:54.720 --> 02:55.720
Hmm?

02:55.800 --> 02:58.880
Thank you. Uh, thank you
so much, Mr. Anderson.

02:58.960 --> 03:01.645
Ah, one more thing, Cassius... "Stuss."

03:02.640 --> 03:04.440
"Stuss"?

03:04.520 --> 03:05.920
S.T.T.S.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.600
Stick to the script.

03:07.680 --> 03:10.809
Stick to the script.
Stick to the script. You got it.

03:12.320 --> 03:13.720
Thank you so much.

03:26.240 --> 03:27.241
Troit!

03:29.520 --> 03:30.521
Troit!

03:32.920 --> 03:33.967
Troit!

03:40.720 --> 03:42.484
You ever think about dying?

03:47.200 --> 03:50.488
Yeah, I'm alive. Sometimes.

03:51.760 --> 03:53.480
No, I don't mean like right now,

03:53.560 --> 03:55.720
in a freak accident or something.

03:55.800 --> 03:59.248
I mean... when we're old, like 90.

04:00.600 --> 04:01.920
I think about it all the time.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.800
Like, what will I have done that matters?

04:04.880 --> 04:06.680
I just want to make sure that when I die

04:06.760 --> 04:08.800
I'll be surrounded by people who love me

04:08.880 --> 04:10.405
and who I love back.

04:11.480 --> 04:12.845
But what about when they die?

04:13.960 --> 04:15.087
What do you mean?

04:16.240 --> 04:19.519
I mean, like at some point we're gonna die.

04:19.600 --> 04:22.560
Our kids are gonna die.
Our kids' kids are gonna die.

04:22.640 --> 04:25.920
And at some point,
no one on Earth will have existed.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.480
And at... at some point...

04:27.560 --> 04:30.880
the sun will explode
and everyone will have died.

04:30.960 --> 04:34.804
And no one will know what I'm doing, and
what I'm doing right now won't even matter.

04:34.920 --> 04:38.040
Baby, baby it will always matter, okay?

04:38.120 --> 04:41.440
Because it matters now.
This moment, these moments.

04:41.520 --> 04:44.280
When I kiss you...
it's not for posterity's sake.

04:44.360 --> 04:46.480
Yeah, but... okay, you got your calling.

04:46.560 --> 04:48.640
Your art means something, right?

04:48.720 --> 04:50.360
But I'm just out here surviving;

04:50.440 --> 04:52.040
spinning around on the endless circle.

04:52.120 --> 04:54.362
- Ah, you missed your cue.
- That's disgusting.

04:54.480 --> 04:58.000
I said, "When I kiss you,
it's not for posterity's sake."

04:58.080 --> 04:59.571
- Yeah, but...
- Mmm!

05:10.760 --> 05:12.160
Oh, God!

05:14.520 --> 05:16.921
- Get a room!
- I got a room, muthafucka!

05:19.120 --> 05:20.770
I thought you said you fixed that!

05:20.880 --> 05:22.883
My landlord was supposed to fix it.

05:23.880 --> 05:25.840
I gotta move.

05:25.920 --> 05:27.840
- Mmm!
- I like that.

05:32.560 --> 05:34.449
I have to go to work anyway.

05:38.240 --> 05:40.800
- Don't you start work today?
- Yeah.

05:40.880 --> 05:44.202
They said they hire anybody
if you're looking for a second job.

05:44.320 --> 05:45.640
You could try part-time.

05:48.280 --> 05:51.240
<i>Everyone is talking
about the WorryFree solution!</i>

05:51.320 --> 05:55.240
<i>WorryFree is a revolutionary new business and
lifestyle model taking the world by storm!</i>

05:55.320 --> 05:56.800
Baby, how much are they paying you?

05:56.880 --> 05:58.320
<i>When you sign a WorryFree contract,</i>

05:58.400 --> 06:01.280

06:01.360 --> 06:03.880
<i>Stop worrying and get WorryFree!</i>

06:03.960 --> 06:06.400

06:06.480 --> 06:08.562
<i>the WorryFree food is to die for,</i>

06:08.680 --> 06:11.680

06:11.760 --> 06:14.161
Cash, baby, what are they paying you?

06:15.560 --> 06:18.120
Uh, I think it's just commission.

06:18.200 --> 06:19.201
Hey, baby...

06:20.240 --> 06:22.163
you ever think about this WorryFree shit?

06:23.160 --> 06:24.960
Are you crazy?

06:25.040 --> 06:26.565
What, working on commission?

06:28.840 --> 06:30.400
Nice earrings.

06:38.280 --> 06:40.240
Hey, Cash!

06:40.320 --> 06:42.200
I got overdue house notes, dude.

06:42.280 --> 06:43.771
How much longer I got to wait for my money?

06:43.880 --> 06:47.400
Look, Serge, I just got a new job
and I'll have some money for you soon.

06:47.480 --> 06:49.320
Damn it, you four months late now.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.562
It's like "soon" is the only
fuckin' word I hear from you.

06:51.680 --> 06:54.160
Okay, I'm four months late, but...

06:55.160 --> 06:56.960
Check this out. Damn.

06:57.040 --> 06:58.960
God made this land for all of us,

06:59.040 --> 07:02.720
and greedy people like you want to hog it
to yourself and your family

07:02.800 --> 07:04.920
and charge all the rest of us
for the right to live.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.840
- Me and my family?
- Yeah.

07:06.920 --> 07:08.800
Cassius, I'm your fucking uncle.

07:08.880 --> 07:10.720
The bank might take my fucking house.

07:10.800 --> 07:12.600
Four fucking months.

07:12.680 --> 07:14.560
I gave you that car you're driving.

07:14.640 --> 07:16.600
- That's a damn bucket.
- Oh, yeah?

07:16.680 --> 07:19.445
Give it back then! No?

07:21.040 --> 07:22.200
That's what I thought.

07:22.280 --> 07:25.045
I need my money in two weeks, asshole.

07:45.040 --> 07:46.640
Hey.

07:46.720 --> 07:47.767
Forty on two.

08:09.160 --> 08:10.161
<i># Oh, yeah #</i>

08:11.240 --> 08:13.040
<i># All right #</i>

08:13.120 --> 08:14.200

08:14.280 --> 08:16.040
- <i># All right #</i>
- <i># That's tight... #</i>

08:16.120 --> 08:17.160
What's up, man!

08:17.240 --> 08:19.120
<i># Oh, yeah #</i>

08:19.200 --> 08:20.840

08:37.159 --> 08:38.160
<i># Hey #</i>

08:39.159 --> 08:40.160
<i># Hey #</i>

08:54.280 --> 08:57.800
Millions of dollars went into these walls

08:57.880 --> 09:01.040
just to... make sure that thousands of calls

09:01.120 --> 09:03.720
can go out and in at the same time

09:03.800 --> 09:05.325
without jamming the lines.

09:06.480 --> 09:07.920
Log in here. Grab a seat.

09:13.600 --> 09:14.601
Come on.

09:15.720 --> 09:17.006
You studied the script?

09:18.000 --> 09:19.840
- Yeah.
- Look, clock in,

09:19.920 --> 09:22.400
don't be lazy,

09:22.480 --> 09:23.760
and I won't have to be an asshole.

09:23.840 --> 09:27.280
Make a sale, this light goes on.

09:27.360 --> 09:29.080
You do real good,

09:29.160 --> 09:34.320
eventually you might even be able
to be a Power Caller.

09:34.400 --> 09:38.280
- A Power Caller?
- Where the callers are ballers.

09:38.360 --> 09:41.523
Where they make the real money.

09:42.720 --> 09:44.529
They even have their own elevator.

09:45.520 --> 09:46.885
Oh, yeah, I saw that.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.331
Stick to the script.

10:12.400 --> 10:13.481
What the fuck?

10:15.680 --> 10:18.960
- Hello.
- Hey, Mr. Davidson.

10:19.040 --> 10:20.724
Cassius Green here. Sorry to bo...

10:21.920 --> 10:23.080
Another one!

10:30.760 --> 10:31.800
Hello?

10:31.880 --> 10:33.880
Uh, this is Cassius Green.
Sorry to bother you.

10:33.960 --> 10:36.080
I just wanted to mention something else about

10:36.160 --> 10:38.000
an encyc... <i>Insight Encyclopedia.</i>

10:45.360 --> 10:47.000
Hello?

10:47.080 --> 10:49.080
- Hi, Mrs. Costello.
- Yes.

10:49.160 --> 10:50.844
This is Cassius Green.

10:50.960 --> 10:54.560
I know that you've enjoyed our, uh,
series on birdwatching,

10:54.640 --> 10:56.840
so I wanted to call and... and help you out.

10:56.920 --> 11:00.288
I'm sorry, young man,
we don't have any money.

11:01.680 --> 11:03.523
My husband's in the hospital.

11:03.640 --> 11:06.720
He's 73. He's got stage 4 cancer.

11:15.080 --> 11:16.889
Um...

11:18.440 --> 11:19.441
it's...

11:21.440 --> 11:23.880
Oh, it's interesting that
you say that, Mrs. Costello,

11:23.960 --> 11:25.800
because book number five
in the <i>Insight</i> series

11:25.880 --> 11:29.520
is all about wellness,
how to stay healthy... on your own

11:29.600 --> 11:31.600
without even going to the doctor, so... so...

11:31.680 --> 11:32.841
Damn it.

11:41.400 --> 11:44.800
Really? You gonna stuff all those
French fries in your mouth?

11:49.600 --> 11:53.241
I feel incompetent
and like an asshole doing this job.

11:55.520 --> 11:56.726
I don't feel any different.

11:58.600 --> 11:59.680
Hey.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.560
That's that the dude from that show.

12:01.640 --> 12:04.640
- Hey! Hey!
- Oh, shit!

12:04.720 --> 12:06.720
That's fucking cool. I hate that show.

12:06.800 --> 12:09.240
But I never noticed that, uh, room.

12:09.320 --> 12:10.640
What... what is that?

12:10.720 --> 12:12.200
The VIP room.

12:12.280 --> 12:15.480
What the hell is a place like this
doing with a VIP room?

12:15.560 --> 12:17.000
I used to be in there all the time.

12:17.080 --> 12:19.520
Well, what qualifies a person to be VIP?

12:19.600 --> 12:22.080
Well, you need the password.

12:22.160 --> 12:24.920
And this week it's "upscale elegance."

12:25.000 --> 12:27.200
Actually, every week it's "upscale elegance."

12:27.280 --> 12:29.362
- I'm goin'.
- Where the fuck you going?

12:34.480 --> 12:35.600
Yeah!

12:53.600 --> 12:55.440
Fuck!

12:55.520 --> 12:57.120
Ah!

13:00.720 --> 13:01.847
That's some baller shit.

13:08.080 --> 13:11.880
Hey! Mr., uh, D. Imits, Cassius Green here.

13:11.960 --> 13:13.600
Sorry to bother you. I just...

13:20.680 --> 13:21.761
Hey, youngblood.

13:24.800 --> 13:26.320
- What up?
- Lemme give you a tip.

13:26.400 --> 13:27.811
Use your white voice.

13:28.800 --> 13:30.643
- My white voice?
- Yeah.

13:31.640 --> 13:33.160
Man, I ain't got no white voice.

13:33.240 --> 13:35.360
Oh, come on, you know
what I mean, youngblood.

13:35.440 --> 13:38.720
You have a white voice in there,
you can use it.

13:38.800 --> 13:42.000
It's like when you get
pulled over by the police.

13:42.080 --> 13:44.960
Oh, no. I just use my regular voice
when that happens.

13:45.040 --> 13:48.080
I just say, "Back the fuck up off the car
and don't nobody get hurt!"

13:48.160 --> 13:50.080
All right, man, I'm just trying
to give you some game.

13:50.160 --> 13:52.360
You wanna make some money here?

13:52.440 --> 13:54.443
Then read the script with a white voice.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.480
Well, people say I talk
with a white voice anyway,

13:58.560 --> 13:59.920
so why it ain't helping me out?

14:00.000 --> 14:02.080
Well, you don't talk white enough.

14:02.160 --> 14:04.040
I'm not talkin' bout Will Smith white.

14:04.120 --> 14:05.800
That ain't white, that's just proper.

14:05.880 --> 14:07.723
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm talking about the real deal.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.000
Okay, so like...

14:10.080 --> 14:13.280
"Hello, Mr. Everet. Cassius Green here.

14:13.360 --> 14:15.931
- Sorry to bother you"...
- Nah, man. Look, you got it wrong.

14:16.040 --> 14:19.920
I'm not talking about sounding all nasal.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.640
It's, like, sounding like
you don't have a care.

14:22.720 --> 14:25.560
Got your bills paid.
You're happy about your future.

14:25.640 --> 14:28.760
You about ready to jump
in your Ferrari out there

14:28.840 --> 14:30.400
after you get off this call.

14:30.480 --> 14:33.200
Put some real breath in there.

14:33.280 --> 14:37.365
Breezy like...
"I don't really need this money."

14:37.480 --> 14:39.280
You've never been fired.

14:39.360 --> 14:41.249
Only laid off.

14:42.240 --> 14:45.120
It's not really a white voice.

14:45.200 --> 14:47.520
It's what they wish they sounded like.

14:47.600 --> 14:52.560
So, it's like what they think
they're supposed to sound like.

14:52.640 --> 14:54.920
Like this, youngblood.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.360
Hey! Mr. Kramer!

14:56.440 --> 14:58.720
This is Langston from RegalView.

14:58.800 --> 15:01.087
I didn't catch you at the wrong time, did I?

15:03.440 --> 15:06.320
If you're ever gonna be a Power Caller,

15:06.400 --> 15:10.120
you gotta know when to
bag 'em and when to tag 'em.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.200
Yeah?

15:11.280 --> 15:14.120
Hey. Um, what's baggin' and what's taggin'?

15:14.200 --> 15:16.680
Bagging is when you drop the call.

15:16.760 --> 15:18.640
Like a dead body into a bag,

15:18.720 --> 15:21.840
you drop that shit
'cause it crossed the line.

15:21.920 --> 15:25.440
Tagging is when you claim that money.

15:25.520 --> 15:27.360
It's a sale. Cha-ching!

15:27.440 --> 15:30.880
Like when they put the tag on the body
at the morgue to identify it.

15:30.960 --> 15:32.400
That's mine.

15:32.480 --> 15:35.880
Maybe you already bagged
that dead body, right?

15:35.960 --> 15:39.120
And you're just about
to walk away, skip town,

15:39.200 --> 15:40.884
lay low for a little while.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.400
But instead, you drag that heavy fucker

15:44.480 --> 15:48.440
on out into the alley and... then you tag it!

15:48.520 --> 15:50.400
Okay. Uh, I... I just...

15:50.480 --> 15:54.200
I feel like these metaphors have not
been cleared for this pep rally.

15:54.280 --> 15:58.880
- Ah, okay. Diana?
- Oh! Yes.

15:58.960 --> 16:01.920
Uh... hi. I'm new,

16:02.000 --> 16:04.560
so forgive me for not knowing
everyone's name yet.

16:04.640 --> 16:07.120
My name is Diana...

16:08.160 --> 16:10.128
Dee-bo-sher-ree.

16:11.800 --> 16:13.880
- That looks like "debauchery."
- Well, it's not.

16:13.960 --> 16:16.560
Uh, I am your new Team Leader!

16:16.640 --> 16:17.971
And I know you're looking at me going,

16:18.080 --> 16:19.760
"Is she a manager? I'm scared." Okay.

16:19.840 --> 16:22.320
"She's going to treat me like a system
of motorized appendages!"

16:22.400 --> 16:24.440
No, that stops here, that stops right now.

16:24.520 --> 16:26.240
You are not employees to me.

16:26.320 --> 16:29.360
You are Team Members! We're a family now.
You know what that means?

16:29.440 --> 16:32.091
It means I lean on you, you lean on me.
There's a synergy.

16:33.120 --> 16:35.120
And you can feel that energy.
I know that you can.

16:35.200 --> 16:37.360
People are starting to get
emotional, and I love that.

16:37.440 --> 16:39.044
Does that mean we get paid more?

16:41.200 --> 16:44.329
"No." Okay, but what is capital? Right?

16:44.440 --> 16:46.680
I would argue that social currency
now is more important,

16:46.760 --> 16:49.120
and don't take it from me,
take it from the news.

16:49.200 --> 16:52.480
Take it from media, all kinds of media:
digital, paper, otherwise.

16:52.560 --> 16:54.400
Media is changing, so is capital.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.720
Get with it. I don't want to scare you,
but it's a new world.

16:56.800 --> 16:59.240
Okay, Team Members. Let's, uh...

16:59.320 --> 17:01.480
thank you very much,
and let's all get back to work.

17:01.560 --> 17:05.160
Remember! Hit your contacts! Up the ante!

17:05.240 --> 17:07.480
Work the grid! And...

17:07.560 --> 17:10.079
- Stick to the script.
- That's right.

17:10.160 --> 17:12.920
Any one of you can turn Power Caller

17:13.000 --> 17:15.162
and be rollin' in dough!

17:20.839 --> 17:22.444
Oh, excuse me.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.002
Ah. Okay.

17:29.840 --> 17:33.527
Nothing in this office is free, man,
you gotta put money in there.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.081
Oh, re... really?

17:36.200 --> 17:38.000
It's okay, you're not missing out.
It tastes like shit.

17:38.080 --> 17:39.844
Fuck. I thought I could get lucky, asshole.

17:40.960 --> 17:43.725
I was just giving you shit, man.
I'm... I'm Squeeze.

17:44.720 --> 17:46.120
I've seen you around for a couple weeks.

17:46.200 --> 17:47.850
It was a good question in there.

17:47.960 --> 17:50.691
Cassius. People call me Cash.

17:51.680 --> 17:53.250
It was a really good question in there, man.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.520
- What, about us getting paid?
- Yeah.

17:56.600 --> 17:58.480
I mean, I just think it's kind of silly

17:58.560 --> 18:00.200
that we have to be all excited.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.760
- I know, right?
- It's bullshit.

18:01.840 --> 18:04.600
Exactly. I mean, you just cut
straight to the chase, man.

18:04.680 --> 18:06.410
That's awesome.

18:06.520 --> 18:09.000
A player gotta mob up with us
for some scrill and bennies.

18:09.080 --> 18:10.650
Well, what the fuck does that mean?

18:12.720 --> 18:15.720
Uh, there's a bunch of us

18:15.800 --> 18:19.600
that are organizing to get us paid more.

18:19.680 --> 18:21.160
Get some benefits.

18:21.240 --> 18:24.164
We could really use your energy
to jump things off.

18:25.320 --> 18:28.000
Yeah, look, I gotta get back to work, man.

18:28.080 --> 18:30.640
Hey, man, look, I'm sorry
I got you like this,

18:30.720 --> 18:33.040
but obviously we can't talk here.

18:33.120 --> 18:36.400
So, grab a drink later. It's on me.

18:52.040 --> 18:53.400
Hey, lady, how much?

18:55.800 --> 18:56.960
- Okay.
- So, we good?

18:57.040 --> 18:58.531
- Yeah.
- Alright.

19:02.200 --> 19:03.804
- Hey.
- What up?

19:05.000 --> 19:06.800
- Who are you?
- That's Squeeze.

19:06.880 --> 19:09.000
- Squeeze.
- He works with us at RegalView.

19:09.080 --> 19:10.280
Squeeze, Detroit.

19:10.360 --> 19:12.680
- Detroit? That's cool.
- Yeah.

19:12.760 --> 19:14.763
My parents wanted me to have
an American name.

19:14.880 --> 19:16.080
Nice!

19:16.160 --> 19:19.400
And Detroit is a brilliant visual
and performance artist...

19:19.480 --> 19:20.960
No, my art is not twirling signs.

19:21.040 --> 19:22.800
...who's about to open her first show.

19:22.880 --> 19:26.600
Okay, "Mr. Embarrassing Intro Guy."

19:26.680 --> 19:28.840
Squeeze, in high school, Cash was...

19:28.920 --> 19:30.560
Shit!

19:30.640 --> 19:32.560
Stuck... brake.

19:34.840 --> 19:37.600
Why do you always talk about
what I did in high school?

19:37.680 --> 19:41.800
I mean, like, look at our
high school football team.

19:41.880 --> 19:43.200
Literally. Look at 'em.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.920
All they do is work at the
home furniture store

19:46.000 --> 19:47.840
and play football all day.

19:47.920 --> 19:50.000
It's, like, they're stuck or something.

19:50.080 --> 19:53.163
Man, what the hell you talkin' bout?
I mean, they're friends.

19:54.680 --> 19:57.809
Baby, can you please not talk
about the sun exploding tonight?

19:58.920 --> 19:59.921
Okay.

20:04.440 --> 20:07.160
Yeah, but you know, I... I just...
at the end of the day

20:07.240 --> 20:09.760
I just don't want to be
stuck in their position.

20:09.840 --> 20:11.365
Ah, shit.

20:11.480 --> 20:13.680
D, wiper duty, please.

20:13.760 --> 20:16.240
Come on, man. I never get wiper duty.

20:16.360 --> 20:18.800
You can wipe my ass, Sal.

20:18.880 --> 20:21.320
Oh, really? With what? My tongue?

20:21.400 --> 20:23.880
Well, shit, it might make your breath
smell a little bit better.

20:23.960 --> 20:27.200
- # <i>Shitty breath, Sal #</i>
- <i># Sal #</i>

20:27.280 --> 20:30.250
- <i># Shitty breath, Sal #</i>
- Oh, God.

20:31.920 --> 20:33.570
<i># The shittiest breath in Oakland #</i>

20:38.560 --> 20:40.880
Keeping turning, Troit. Turn.

20:40.960 --> 20:43.160
<i>...the fourth day of violent protests</i>

20:43.240 --> 20:44.760

20:44.840 --> 20:46.920

20:47.000 --> 20:48.720

20:59.400 --> 21:00.720

21:00.800 --> 21:02.520

21:02.600 --> 21:05.280

<i>I Got the Shit Kicked Out of Me!</i>

21:38.840 --> 21:41.120
All I'm saying is if you
don't cook the spaghetti

21:41.200 --> 21:43.720
in the sauce with the cheese in it first,

21:43.800 --> 21:47.320
- that's some white shit.
- That's some bullshit man.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.840
You don't get to decide
what's black and what's white.

21:49.920 --> 21:52.480
Well, that-that...
but that's how black folks do it, man.

21:52.560 --> 21:55.320
- No, nigga, I'm black.
- We talked about that, man.

21:55.400 --> 21:57.200
You kind of black, you Lionel-Richie black.

21:57.280 --> 22:00.000
Look, I... I make my noodles,

22:00.080 --> 22:02.240
then I put the sauce on, then... look it,

22:02.320 --> 22:03.920
then I put a little, uh, Parmesan...

22:04.000 --> 22:05.320
it doesn't even fucking matter, alright,

22:05.400 --> 22:06.880
'cause pasta is from Italy.

22:06.960 --> 22:07.960
Italians ain't white!

22:08.040 --> 22:09.531
- Yes, they are, bro.
- Yes, they are!

22:09.640 --> 22:11.240
Since the fuck when?

22:11.320 --> 22:13.600
Since the last 60 years, man.

22:13.680 --> 22:14.840
Spaghetti is Chinese.

22:14.920 --> 22:17.960
Speaking of white, I'm gonna make a toast.

22:18.040 --> 22:19.280
- Come on.
- A'ight.

22:20.440 --> 22:21.487
Okay.

22:25.320 --> 22:27.920
To my esteemed RegalView associates

22:28.000 --> 22:30.560
whom I revere with great fervor...

22:30.640 --> 22:31.920
What?

22:32.000 --> 22:35.925
...and to my alluring and phenomenally
talented fiancée...

22:38.280 --> 22:40.360
I'd like to dedicate this imbibing

22:40.440 --> 22:42.280
of intoxicating elixirs.

22:42.360 --> 22:45.160
Here's to becoming a Power Caller!

22:53.480 --> 22:55.040
Cassius, how'd you do that?

22:55.120 --> 22:57.600
Old man at the jobby-job.

22:57.680 --> 22:58.800
It's called the white voice.

22:58.880 --> 23:00.720
I guess I'm... a natural at it.

23:00.800 --> 23:02.960
That was all some puppet-master voodoo shit!

23:03.040 --> 23:04.560
Dude, you sounded overdubbed.

23:04.640 --> 23:07.211
Man, your white voice, man,
it's fucking scary.

23:07.320 --> 23:08.840
Yeah, I've never seen that shit before.

23:08.920 --> 23:12.400
But I have heard about that Power Caller
shit that you're talking about.

23:12.480 --> 23:13.440
That's a scam.

23:13.520 --> 23:14.931
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

23:16.040 --> 23:17.560
"If you work hard enough as a fry cook,

23:17.640 --> 23:19.720
maybe you can become a manager!"

23:19.800 --> 23:23.320
Or... or "If you twirl that sign really well,

23:23.400 --> 23:27.000
then maybe you can twirl a larger sign
on a more glamorous corner."

23:27.080 --> 23:28.920
No, I already have the best corner,

23:29.000 --> 23:31.920
and the biggest sign,
and the best word. "Off."

23:32.000 --> 23:33.570
It is the anchor to the slogan.

23:33.680 --> 23:35.600
- So...
- So, what's the point then?

23:35.680 --> 23:39.000
What you think, I'm just supposed
to work, eat, fuck, sleep?

23:39.080 --> 23:42.163
No, I'm... I'm not saying that.
I'm saying what we need...

23:44.440 --> 23:46.400
We need a union at RegalView.

23:46.480 --> 23:48.080
That way, we all get paid.

23:48.160 --> 23:51.720
Okay. Okay. Well said, broham.

23:51.800 --> 23:53.370
I'm down.

23:59.560 --> 24:01.640
- Hey, Cassius.
- Hey, Serge.

24:01.720 --> 24:04.680
Uh, look, I get paid Friday,
so I'll have half your money by then.

24:04.760 --> 24:06.240
Even if you had all the money,

24:06.320 --> 24:08.240
your little four month's rent
wouldn't help me.

24:08.320 --> 24:09.760
I owe too much.

24:09.840 --> 24:11.480
If I don't come up with a boatload of money

24:11.560 --> 24:13.085
by next month... which I won't...

24:14.120 --> 24:15.880
the bank is taking my shit.

24:15.960 --> 24:17.485
You should find a new place.

24:18.920 --> 24:19.880
Damn.

24:19.960 --> 24:22.327
It's making my diabetes act up.

24:28.320 --> 24:29.560
So, what you gonna do?

24:29.640 --> 24:31.960
I've been talkin' to those WorryFree people.

24:32.040 --> 24:35.240
They sent me a brochure.
It don't sound that bad.

24:35.320 --> 24:37.520
Three hots and a cot, like we used to say.

24:37.600 --> 24:40.080
- Oh, hell no, Serge. Come on.
- No, don't... don't do that.

24:40.160 --> 24:41.651
Look, we'll figure something out.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.680
Yes, I'm so sorry to bother you.

24:44.760 --> 24:46.640
Yeah, well, let me tell you.
I got a special for you.

24:46.720 --> 24:49.280
Look, you bring a chick
home to your apartment.

24:49.360 --> 24:51.400
It's clean. It's stylish.

24:51.480 --> 24:53.040
Of course, it is. She's already seen that

24:53.120 --> 24:54.520
from the guy she was with two weeks ago.

24:54.600 --> 24:56.280
And then her eyes move over

24:56.360 --> 24:58.320
to those brown leather bad boys

24:58.400 --> 25:01.449
from the <i>Insight Encyclopedias,</i>
<i>Intellectual Edition.</i>

25:02.720 --> 25:04.600
- It's fuck time! Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah!

25:04.680 --> 25:06.728
Yeah! Holla, holla, holla, holla, holla!

25:07.760 --> 25:09.320
Oh, yeah?

25:09.400 --> 25:11.360
Spin Doctors. Classic!

25:11.440 --> 25:13.680
Tim, I want to chop it up more,

25:13.760 --> 25:15.800
but I gotta get to my squash game.

25:15.880 --> 25:18.880
Was that Visa or Mastercard?

25:18.960 --> 25:21.167
God, this voice shit is crazy.

25:26.480 --> 25:27.440
Yeah!

25:27.520 --> 25:29.160
- <i># Oh, yeah... #</i>
- Oh!

25:29.240 --> 25:31.120
<i># All right #</i>

25:31.200 --> 25:32.320
Yeah!

25:32.400 --> 25:34.480
- Yes! Tell that bitch "yes"! Yes!
- Yes!

25:34.560 --> 25:37.200
- Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

25:37.280 --> 25:40.000
<i># All right, hell yeah... #</i>

25:40.080 --> 25:41.889
<i># That's tight #</i>

25:43.240 --> 25:44.200
<i># Hey #</i>

25:44.280 --> 25:45.480
Where's the wine at?

25:45.560 --> 25:47.369
Power Calling all you motherfuckers!

25:47.480 --> 25:50.720
I'm going to have you playing basketball
in Pelican Bay!

25:50.800 --> 25:52.320
Yeah!

25:52.400 --> 25:53.920
Baby, yes!

25:54.000 --> 25:56.200
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

25:56.280 --> 25:59.280
Woo! Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

25:59.360 --> 26:00.480
Yes!

26:04.480 --> 26:06.240
I...I should probably get back to work, man.

26:08.320 --> 26:10.880
You're stoked, man!

26:10.960 --> 26:13.240
You're doin' so fucking good
with the voice thing.

26:13.320 --> 26:15.560
But hit more contacts per hour.

26:15.640 --> 26:17.040
Mm-hmm.

26:17.120 --> 26:20.169
Oh. They're talkin' about you, bro.

26:21.240 --> 26:23.040
You're on your way.

26:23.120 --> 26:24.920
Pah!

26:25.000 --> 26:27.367
To where, heaven?

26:27.480 --> 26:29.440
Almost.

26:29.520 --> 26:32.729
PC, baby. Power Caller.

26:34.920 --> 26:36.365
Oh, uh...

26:40.920 --> 26:43.520
- Did you hear what he just said?
- Yeah, yeah, I heard him, man.

26:43.600 --> 26:45.680
He told me the exact same shit
three months ago.

26:45.760 --> 26:47.364
Nice earrings.

26:48.640 --> 26:50.529
Thanks. Made 'em myself.

26:57.440 --> 26:59.800
<i># Copulation #</i>

26:59.880 --> 27:02.000
<i># An equation... #</i>

27:12.120 --> 27:13.400
What kind of world is it

27:13.480 --> 27:15.528
when this is the most popular show
in America?

27:16.880 --> 27:19.760
They say 150 million people
watch this every night.

27:19.840 --> 27:21.046
Mmm.

27:21.160 --> 27:22.920
I, personally, love seeing

27:23.000 --> 27:25.160
a muthafucka get beat down and humiliated.

27:26.440 --> 27:28.488
Makes... makes me feel warm inside.

27:29.880 --> 27:32.120
I got the muthafucking T-shirt.

27:32.200 --> 27:33.804
- Oh!
- Check this.

27:33.920 --> 27:35.120
Oh!

27:35.200 --> 27:39.400
- I'm gonna go dance, man.
- Alright. Yeah, motherfucka.

27:48.280 --> 27:50.362
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm! No.

27:50.480 --> 27:51.641
Give me the good stuff.

27:52.720 --> 27:55.007
Give me the good stuff.

27:57.080 --> 27:58.081
Yeah.

28:01.320 --> 28:03.323
That's what I'm talking about.

28:04.320 --> 28:06.720
So, why you ain't dancing' man?

28:06.800 --> 28:09.080
Motherfucker, I'm too old for that shit.

28:10.640 --> 28:14.240
Man look, what happened to just
doing the muthafucking dog,

28:14.320 --> 28:16.280
Umf-umf-umf-bow-wow.

28:16.360 --> 28:19.440
You know I'm freakin,
you know what I'm saying?

28:19.520 --> 28:23.400
Shit, now you got to dislocate
your muthafucking shoulder.

28:23.480 --> 28:25.722
Damn, what the fuck
I look like doin that shit?

28:26.840 --> 28:27.960
You, uh...

28:28.040 --> 28:30.566
Hey. Power Callers, right?

28:31.720 --> 28:33.800
They make a shit ton of money, man.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.920
I'm talking about, like, Benz,

28:36.000 --> 28:39.209
and expensive house payment type of money.

28:39.320 --> 28:41.040
How the fuck is that even possible?

28:41.120 --> 28:45.680
If you selling the bullshit
we selling, it's impossible.

28:45.760 --> 28:48.640
But they not selling the bullshit we selling.

28:48.720 --> 28:50.360
So, I guess comparing to what we doing

28:50.440 --> 28:53.680
to what they're doing
is like apples to oranges.

28:53.760 --> 28:56.889
More like apples and the Holocaust.

29:00.560 --> 29:02.040
Alright. Bye.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.920
Don't look into the light.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.320
Fuckin' asshole.

29:15.080 --> 29:16.880
- What up bro?
- What's up man?

29:16.960 --> 29:18.720
- Good man.
- Aw, that hurt.

29:18.800 --> 29:20.211
It's all good. I've been telling

29:20.320 --> 29:22.720
everybody how you've been
kicking all types of ass at work.

29:22.800 --> 29:25.280
Yea. I mean it's crazy. I'm finally...

29:25.360 --> 29:26.760
feel like I'm good at something.

29:26.840 --> 29:28.160
I'm feeling myself.

29:28.240 --> 29:30.320
- Word.
- I'm a fucking monster at this.

29:32.360 --> 29:34.200
Man. That's awesome, man.

29:34.280 --> 29:35.480
Fucking dope man. That's awesome.

29:35.560 --> 29:37.164
Yeah... whoa!

29:38.240 --> 29:40.880
- Hey, Sugar Foot. Hey.
- Hey, Lovely.

29:40.960 --> 29:43.160
- Can I get that?
- Who invited you?

29:43.240 --> 29:44.800
Who asked you?

29:44.880 --> 29:46.520
I was hoping you'd pop up earlier.

29:46.600 --> 29:48.000
I thought you were coming by.

29:48.080 --> 29:50.481
Oh, to your gallery?
I thought you said don't come.

29:50.600 --> 29:51.760
Your friends were helping you out.

29:51.840 --> 29:55.280
Baby, that's what I said.
But don't listen to what I say.

29:55.360 --> 29:57.560
Listen to what I want.

29:57.640 --> 29:59.240
- I'm confused.
- Yeah, I know you are.

29:59.320 --> 30:01.160
But are you gonna pick me up on Friday?

30:01.240 --> 30:03.163
- That's what I want.
- Is cash green?

30:03.280 --> 30:04.691
Yeah. Cash is green.

30:07.240 --> 30:09.243
- Can I get a light?
- No.

30:11.240 --> 30:13.440
Those are nice earrings.

30:13.520 --> 30:16.126
Wait, baby. I didn't know
you changed your earrings.

30:18.360 --> 30:21.364
Detroit, I didn't know you made
earrings of your ex-boyfriends.

30:56.640 --> 30:58.120
Alright, everybody.

30:58.200 --> 31:00.440
This is a pretty amazing turnout.

31:00.520 --> 31:02.640
I hope you guys all know
that we're in this together.

31:02.720 --> 31:05.440
That this is all of us, ride or die.

31:05.520 --> 31:07.440
You know what today is?

31:07.520 --> 31:09.160
Today is the warning shot.

31:09.240 --> 31:10.924
Telling them that we stand united.

31:12.040 --> 31:13.840
If we get this right today,

31:13.920 --> 31:15.160
not only will it be our floor

31:15.240 --> 31:17.880
but it will be every other floor
in RegalView and beyond.

31:17.960 --> 31:21.880
A twenty-minute work stoppage
during prime calling time.

31:21.960 --> 31:24.040
I'll give the call. Sal, what's the call?

31:24.120 --> 31:26.080
Fuck you, pay me.

31:26.160 --> 31:28.240
The other... other one.

31:28.320 --> 31:31.240
Phones down.

31:31.320 --> 31:33.200
Okay?

31:33.280 --> 31:35.880
We hang up the phones. Put down our headsets.

31:35.960 --> 31:37.883
Now, they're gonna single some of us out.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.520
- Threaten our jobs.
- Fuck that.

31:40.600 --> 31:43.120
- Yes, fuck that.
- Fuck that.

31:43.200 --> 31:44.400
- Fuck that.
- Yeah, fuck.

31:44.480 --> 31:47.640
We ride for anyone they try to fire.

31:47.720 --> 31:49.280
We fight

31:49.360 --> 31:52.400
because we make the profits
and they don't share.

31:52.480 --> 31:55.000
If we're gonna give them our day,

31:55.080 --> 31:58.640
we need to have enough
to cover our basic necessities.

31:58.720 --> 32:00.688
- Human decency.
- Yeah.

32:01.800 --> 32:03.768
Is anyone not down?

32:05.400 --> 32:06.600
Speak now.

32:06.680 --> 32:08.364
Nah, fuck that, Squeeze! We're ready!

32:09.400 --> 32:10.401
Hmm?

32:11.440 --> 32:14.960
Yeah. Uh, one for all. All for one.

32:15.040 --> 32:17.247
Yeah! I brought all types of weapons.

32:18.720 --> 32:22.320
Alright, folks. Let's meet back
here at 3:00 PM. Okay?

32:22.400 --> 32:25.120
- Don't. It's not that serious.
- Okay, alright cool.

32:25.200 --> 32:26.770
It's like serious, but it's not that...

32:26.880 --> 32:27.847
But I'm ready though.

33:04.360 --> 33:06.640
Thanks, Mr. Goldberg.

33:06.720 --> 33:10.320
As always, we'll be getting
that out to you right away.

33:10.400 --> 33:11.800
By the way...

33:11.880 --> 33:14.122
RegalView management...

33:16.440 --> 33:18.488
you are hereby warned.

33:19.720 --> 33:22.530
We will not be overlooked.

33:26.080 --> 33:27.923
Fucking God...

33:29.520 --> 33:33.520
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

33:33.600 --> 33:35.603
Phones down!

33:37.800 --> 33:39.882
Fuck you! Fuck you!

33:40.880 --> 33:41.881
And fuck you!

33:43.280 --> 33:44.884
Fuck you, RegalView!

33:45.000 --> 33:48.600
Fuck you, RegalView! Fuck you, RegalView!

33:48.680 --> 33:52.280
Fuck you, RegalView! Fuck you, RegalView!

33:52.360 --> 33:54.200
Fuck you, RegalView!

33:54.280 --> 33:57.880
Fuck you, RegalView! Fuck you, RegalView!

33:57.960 --> 33:59.720
Fuck you, RegalView!

33:59.800 --> 34:03.280
Fuck you, RegalView! Fuck you, RegalView!

34:03.360 --> 34:04.920
Fuck you, RegalView!

34:05.000 --> 34:08.520
Fuck you, RegalView! Fuck you, RegalView!

34:08.600 --> 34:10.360
Fuck you, RegalView!

34:10.440 --> 34:12.800
Fuck you, RegalView!

34:16.040 --> 34:17.882
##

34:20.639 --> 34:21.880
Oh, man!

34:30.000 --> 34:31.570
Out, out, out, out, out, out, out.

34:40.040 --> 34:41.159
Alright, hey, look,

34:41.239 --> 34:43.120
I know you're gonna threaten to fire me.

34:43.199 --> 34:44.679
And go ahead whatever. I don't care anymore

34:44.760 --> 34:46.159
cause we're gonna take this fuckin place...

34:49.280 --> 34:51.760
Pack up your shit and get out.

34:51.840 --> 34:55.120
Well, fuck you and fuck you and fuck you!

34:55.199 --> 34:56.480
- What? No...
- Fuck you!

34:56.560 --> 34:59.240
- Fuck you!
- No, no, no, no, no, no Mr. Green.

34:59.320 --> 35:01.480
You're starting to sound
a little paranoid here.

35:01.560 --> 35:03.760
We're the bearers of good news.

35:03.840 --> 35:04.967
Great news.

35:05.080 --> 35:06.923
Great mothafuckin' news.

35:07.040 --> 35:09.120
Great motherfucking news.

35:09.200 --> 35:10.720
Power Caller.

35:10.800 --> 35:12.920
- What the fuck...
- Yeah, we just got the call.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.684
They think you're A-1 material.

35:14.800 --> 35:17.040
You're going upstairs my <i>compadre.</i>

35:17.120 --> 35:20.080
Yes. You are getting a promotion.

35:20.160 --> 35:22.360
9:00 AM tomorrow morning.

35:22.440 --> 35:24.800
- Do you have a suit?
- Of course he does.

35:24.880 --> 35:29.160
Powerful, young, strong,
intelligent Power Caller.

35:29.240 --> 35:31.200
- But, but they, um...
- Oh, God.

35:31.280 --> 35:32.920
They're gonna do what they're gonna do.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.720
You're not going against their actions.

35:34.800 --> 35:37.280
All their issues are down here. Not up there.

35:38.600 --> 35:40.920
Two very different kinds of telemarketing.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.527
But, but, oh, okay, um...

35:49.640 --> 35:52.480
This is your moment. Don't waste it.

35:52.560 --> 35:54.927
Woo woo! Woo woo! Woo woo!

35:58.320 --> 35:59.321
Okay.

36:03.560 --> 36:04.680
Maybe you're right.

36:04.760 --> 36:06.120
The big money.

36:06.200 --> 36:09.640
The top fucking tier of telemarketing.

36:09.720 --> 36:14.328
Making history with legends like Hal Jameson.

36:14.440 --> 36:15.931
Bad ass.

36:20.320 --> 36:23.688
Oh, it's a really good batch,
so I hope you like France.

36:24.920 --> 36:26.400
You should have some.

36:27.720 --> 36:30.200
- Should I just drink it right now?
- Yes!

36:31.280 --> 36:33.720
Oh, yes!

36:36.120 --> 36:38.120
- Because we didn't have any cups.
- Power Caller.

36:38.200 --> 36:40.203
- Yeah!
- Yes!

36:42.920 --> 36:44.400
Power Caller, baby.

36:44.480 --> 36:46.880
- Power Caller, man!
- Power Caller!

36:46.960 --> 36:48.200
Power Caller. Power Caller.

36:50.440 --> 36:51.521
##

37:01.320 --> 37:05.086
Wow, you really are ready, aren't you?

37:05.200 --> 37:07.407
Hey, Ms. D. Yeah.

37:08.520 --> 37:11.205
Wow, oh, okay, well let's do
this, mu-tha-fuck-ah.

37:13.720 --> 37:15.051
I've always wanted to say that.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.520
Okay.

37:19.600 --> 37:22.080
I would be remiss if I didn't
bring up your pink shirt.

37:22.160 --> 37:25.360
I think it's extraordinary and sexy.

37:25.440 --> 37:27.920
You know, 35% of men who wear pink

37:28.000 --> 37:31.120
are more likely to start a franchise.

37:31.200 --> 37:32.840
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

37:32.920 --> 37:36.840
- Oh.
- Wow. Damn.

37:36.920 --> 37:39.680
- This is crazy.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

37:39.760 --> 37:41.364
So clumsy.

38:00.240 --> 38:01.840
Almost done...

38:01.920 --> 38:03.285
this job's crazy right?

38:12.920 --> 38:14.570
Do you need help or something?

38:23.160 --> 38:24.161
Okay.

38:25.920 --> 38:28.082
It's very secure. It's very...

38:28.200 --> 38:29.600
<i>Welcome, Power Caller.</i>

38:29.680 --> 38:32.360
<i>Today is your day to dominate the world.</i>

38:32.440 --> 38:34.800
<i>You are RegalView's elite brigade.</i>

38:34.880 --> 38:38.520
<i>Take your place alongside
legends like Hal Jameson.</i>

38:38.600 --> 38:40.762
<i>You call the shots.</i>

38:40.880 --> 38:43.320
What...?

38:43.400 --> 38:45.480
<i>You are in your sexual prime.</i>

38:45.560 --> 38:47.847
<i>The top of the reproductive pile.</i>

38:49.840 --> 38:51.840
Alright, does it do that every time...

38:51.920 --> 38:55.960
Welcome to
the Power Calling Suite, Mr. Green.

38:56.040 --> 38:58.040
White Voice at all times here.

38:58.120 --> 39:00.965
Yes, I almost forgot.

39:03.560 --> 39:05.051
Good luck.

39:07.440 --> 39:08.880
Nice suit, by the way.

39:08.960 --> 39:10.680
You've been selected, Mr. Green,

39:10.760 --> 39:14.003
because you have the potential
to be a great telemarketer.

39:14.120 --> 39:15.360
The potential.

39:15.440 --> 39:17.240
Do you know what we sell up here?

39:17.320 --> 39:19.800
- Oh, I heard it's a...
- Ah, we sell power.

39:19.880 --> 39:22.600
Firepower. Manpower.

39:22.680 --> 39:26.880
When U.S. weapons manufacturers
sell arms to other countries

39:26.960 --> 39:30.280
who do you think, Mr. Green, makes
that call at the precisely perfect time?

39:30.360 --> 39:32.567
Which is, of course, dinner. We do.

39:33.720 --> 39:35.680
Before a drone drops a bomb

39:35.760 --> 39:38.200
on an apartment building in Pakistan

39:38.280 --> 39:40.040
who drops the bomb ass sales pitch

39:40.120 --> 39:41.326
you may ask, Cassius?

39:42.440 --> 39:43.800
We do.

39:43.880 --> 39:48.480
Okay, so you said firepower, manpower?

39:48.560 --> 39:50.320
WorryFree is our biggest client.

39:50.400 --> 39:54.640
We help thousands of companies
utilize WorryFree workers

39:54.720 --> 39:57.451
to improve their efficiency.

39:58.720 --> 40:01.280
So, wait, are you telling me
you sell slave labor

40:01.360 --> 40:02.720
to companies over the phone?

40:02.800 --> 40:05.645
Hot damnit. You are a sharp one.

40:26.440 --> 40:28.408
Hey, what the fuck are you doing?

40:30.640 --> 40:32.210
Dave, stop him.

40:33.640 --> 40:34.641
Shit!

40:39.400 --> 40:41.080
Left Eye, bitches!

40:41.160 --> 40:43.640
WorryFree has resuscitated America.

40:43.720 --> 40:45.480
Workers live in space efficient dwellings

40:45.560 --> 40:47.767
in the same facilities where
production occurs.

40:47.880 --> 40:49.920
They make anything and they make everything.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.004
Lifetime contracts so no wages needed.

40:54.080 --> 40:58.800
They make automobiles for what
it used to cost to make bicycles.

40:58.880 --> 41:00.640
Okay, but see I don't know if I can...

41:00.720 --> 41:02.520
Sugar on top, white voice.

41:02.600 --> 41:04.160
Yeah, but what I'm saying is I don't know

41:04.240 --> 41:05.680
if I'm gonna be able to s... sell...

41:07.000 --> 41:08.525
Here's the starting salary.

41:13.800 --> 41:14.881
Hmm?

41:18.440 --> 41:21.280
Well, man, I'm gonna have
to get me some new suits.

41:21.360 --> 41:23.120
You'll be working here until late.

41:23.200 --> 41:25.960
We need you in the mix right away.

41:33.720 --> 41:35.240
Hey baby, what's your sign?

41:35.320 --> 41:36.924
I haven't heard that one before.

41:38.720 --> 41:40.120
Yo, that was crazy yesterday.

41:40.200 --> 41:42.080
That was like that scene in Norma Rae.

41:42.160 --> 41:43.760
You know, the one when
she's like on the table.

41:43.840 --> 41:45.001
Yeah, yeah.

41:46.040 --> 41:48.771
Yeah, RegalView is scared shitless.
We'll win.

41:50.640 --> 41:51.846
Can I check that out?

41:53.440 --> 41:54.441
Yeah.

41:58.160 --> 41:59.685
Oh, okay.

42:07.040 --> 42:08.804
Okay. Bravo.

42:08.920 --> 42:10.280
Where'd you learn how to do that?

42:10.360 --> 42:11.441
Down in L.A.

42:12.480 --> 42:15.720
We organized the first sign
twirlers union there.

42:15.800 --> 42:17.720
Oh, okay.

42:17.800 --> 42:18.760
Is that what you do?

42:18.840 --> 42:21.680
You just go from place to place
stirring up trouble?

42:21.760 --> 42:24.969
Trouble's already there.
I just help folks fix it.

42:26.280 --> 42:29.560
Yeah, that's what I do with
my art too, you know.

42:29.640 --> 42:31.080
Expose the bullshit.

42:31.160 --> 42:34.600
- It's not exactly the same thing.
- It's pretty much the same.

42:34.680 --> 42:36.520
I haven't seen your stuff so I can't...

42:36.600 --> 42:38.523
I'm not gonna show you my stuff.

42:39.920 --> 42:43.003
So how does it work with, uh...

42:44.640 --> 42:45.880
with you and Cassius?

42:47.720 --> 42:49.529
You know, you sound like a radical.

42:50.680 --> 42:51.761
He's... I don't know.

42:54.480 --> 42:55.811
He's what?

43:02.080 --> 43:03.720
He's real.

43:03.800 --> 43:05.920
He's not that fake-ass bougie gallery world.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.082
So, that's how it works.

43:13.080 --> 43:15.287
Well, you're rubbing him off right. So...

43:16.440 --> 43:19.091
He helped with the work stoppage. So...

43:19.200 --> 43:21.248
Your fire is rubbing off on him.

43:22.240 --> 43:23.367
I like it.

43:24.760 --> 43:26.560
I'm going.

43:26.640 --> 43:29.120
You look like you're done here
if you need a ride.

43:29.200 --> 43:32.727
Nah, Cash is on the way. But thank you.

43:40.480 --> 43:41.845
Nice work.

43:52.800 --> 43:55.440
Hey girl. We gotta go!

43:55.520 --> 43:56.560
Thank you.

44:39.720 --> 44:41.520
You okay?

44:41.600 --> 44:42.640
Yeah.

44:42.720 --> 44:45.480
- Did you get into an accident?
- No.

44:45.560 --> 44:47.560
How about robbed or
something else crazy like that.

44:47.640 --> 44:50.840
So, I don't think you flaked and
left me on a corner for an hour.

44:50.920 --> 44:53.360
Yeah, I know. Look baby
I was gonna talk to you about it earlier

44:53.440 --> 44:55.560
but I didn't know if it would be
a for sure thing or not.

44:55.640 --> 44:58.840
But, as of today I'm a Power Caller.

44:58.920 --> 45:01.082
Does that mean you can pay me back my $80?

45:02.520 --> 45:04.360
Hell, yes, baby, of course I can.

45:04.440 --> 45:07.523
Stop Cassius. Stop, it's freaky.

45:07.640 --> 45:09.085
What do they sell?

45:10.080 --> 45:12.560
Am I finally gonna be able to see your show?

45:13.600 --> 45:16.400
Baby, this is beautiful.

45:16.480 --> 45:19.040
And big.

45:19.120 --> 45:20.451
Africa.

45:21.840 --> 45:24.880
Oh, really, is that what this is?

45:24.960 --> 45:27.680
Yeah, I mean they're big
because they're Africa.

45:27.760 --> 45:31.120
So, I added the sculptures from last year.

45:31.200 --> 45:33.760
Oh, okay. Well, if nobody shows up

45:33.840 --> 45:35.490
at least it'll look full.

45:36.520 --> 45:38.360
Can I... can I ask a question?

45:38.440 --> 45:40.841
Why did you choose Africa?

45:42.160 --> 45:47.400
I wanted to talk about a life
shaped by exploitation.

45:47.480 --> 45:51.400
About fighting for a say in our own lives.

45:51.480 --> 45:54.760
About how beauty, love, and laughter

45:54.840 --> 45:58.000
thrive and flourish under almost
any circumstances...

45:58.080 --> 45:59.286
Right.

45:59.400 --> 46:01.520
How Capitalism basically started

46:01.600 --> 46:04.080
by stealing labor from Africans

46:04.160 --> 46:06.240
and about how you're nodding

46:06.320 --> 46:07.640
like you're listening but you're not.

46:07.720 --> 46:11.080
Oh, no sorry, baby. I was receiving that.

46:11.160 --> 46:14.320
I was just had a long day and...

46:14.400 --> 46:15.845
- it's work.
- It's okay.

46:15.960 --> 46:17.520
You really want to hit this?

46:17.600 --> 46:18.727
Yes.

46:26.120 --> 46:29.000
Ah... yes, okay. I'm listening now.

46:29.080 --> 46:32.280
Capitalism in Africa is booming.

46:32.360 --> 46:35.120
Shh. I'm done talking.

46:35.200 --> 46:37.680
I just want to marinate in this.

46:37.760 --> 46:40.286
This is major for me, Cash.

46:40.400 --> 46:42.680
What I want to do is I want to sit here,

46:42.760 --> 46:44.600
hit this weed

46:44.680 --> 46:46.683
and just be here.

46:47.880 --> 46:50.520
Alright, guys. That felt good
the other day, right?

46:50.600 --> 46:51.960
- Yes.
- Yes. Good, man.

46:52.040 --> 46:54.080
Like I've known y'all
my whole life, you know.

46:54.160 --> 46:56.000
Don't forget that. Okay?

46:56.080 --> 46:58.083
Remember each other's faces.

46:59.440 --> 47:01.160
Cassius? What's up man? Where you been?

47:01.240 --> 47:02.640
What's up with the suit?

47:02.720 --> 47:04.320
I got promoted.

47:04.400 --> 47:06.080
What does that mean? Are you a manager now?

47:06.160 --> 47:08.606
That means I'm a Power Caller now.

47:08.720 --> 47:11.440
- About to be paid.
- We're all trying to get fucking paid.

47:11.520 --> 47:13.400
- Yeah.
- But we're gonna do it as a team.

47:13.480 --> 47:14.447
Are you on the team?

47:14.560 --> 47:16.000
Yeah, I guess I'm still on your little team

47:16.080 --> 47:17.800
but I'm playing from the bench.

47:17.880 --> 47:19.520
The bench where you sit
and get your bills paid.

47:19.600 --> 47:21.720
You know my uncle is about to lose his house.

47:21.800 --> 47:23.800
Cash, I'm sorry about your uncle, man,

47:23.880 --> 47:25.160
but that don't mean sell out.

47:25.240 --> 47:27.129
I'm not selling y'all out.

47:27.240 --> 47:29.640
My success has nothing to do
with you, alright.

47:29.720 --> 47:31.320
You just keep doing whatever it is

47:31.400 --> 47:33.440
that you're fucking doing
and I'll root for you.

47:33.520 --> 47:35.520
From the sidelines.

47:35.600 --> 47:37.887
And try not to laugh at that
stupid ass smirk on your face.

47:38.000 --> 47:39.240
We don't need this.

47:41.160 --> 47:43.000
- Are you doing alright?
- Yeah, I'm doing good.

47:43.080 --> 47:44.480
- How you doing?
- Fantastic.

47:44.560 --> 47:46.480
- Fantastic?
- I hope you have a good day.

47:46.560 --> 47:47.880
I hope you have a better week.

47:47.960 --> 47:50.280
I hope your month is full of successful days.

47:50.360 --> 47:52.760
And a lot of great ventures.
I hope you just come up, brother.

47:52.840 --> 47:54.440
I hope your whole fucking year
is spectacular.

47:54.520 --> 47:57.240
- Oh, you hope my year is spectacular?
- Yeah.

47:57.320 --> 47:58.800
You got something you want to say to me?

47:58.880 --> 48:00.689
You got something you want to say?

48:04.120 --> 48:06.760
- You smell great.
- You smell great. What is that?

48:06.840 --> 48:08.440
Burberry. What you got on?

48:08.520 --> 48:10.400
- I forgot. It's just deodorant.
- Smells expensive. Okay.

48:10.480 --> 48:11.680
- Yeah. Good.
- We smelling good.

48:11.760 --> 48:13.360
Some smelling good brothers out here.

48:13.440 --> 48:15.120
You're an awesome man and I appreciate you.

48:15.200 --> 48:17.320
- I hope you find yourself.
- Yeah, we should go out. Get drinks.

48:17.400 --> 48:18.440
- You want to get drinks?
- Yeah!

48:18.520 --> 48:20.080
- How many drinks?
- Two. Three.

48:20.160 --> 48:21.400
- Three? Five?
- Four! Five!

48:21.480 --> 48:22.760
- Six? Eight?
- Seven! Nine!

48:22.840 --> 48:24.040
- Ten? On me?
- All of them!

48:24.120 --> 48:25.240
It's on me, no, it's on me now!

48:25.320 --> 48:26.600
- It's on you?
- Yeah, it's on me now.

48:26.680 --> 48:28.840
- Alright. Alright!
- Yeah, it's on me!

48:28.920 --> 48:30.490
- It's on you now.
-Now!

48:32.880 --> 48:33.881
Walk!

48:55.920 --> 48:57.520
<i>Greetings, Cassius Green.</i>

48:57.600 --> 49:00.040
<i>I hope you did not masturbate today.</i>

49:00.120 --> 49:02.720
<i>We need you sharp and ready to go.</i>

49:02.800 --> 49:06.200
<i>I detect the pheromones
percolating out of your pores.</i>

49:06.280 --> 49:08.000
<i>They say to others around you:</i>

49:08.080 --> 49:12.240
<i>"Hold my penis while I piss on your
underestimated expectations."</i>

49:12.320 --> 49:15.200
<i>Mr. Green, I am a computer</i>

49:15.280 --> 49:18.728
<i>but I wish I had hands to
caress your muscular brain.</i>

49:19.080 --> 49:21.640
Cassius Green, you've been
assigned a WorryFree campaign.

49:21.720 --> 49:23.760
Brush up on that Chapter Six stuff.

49:23.840 --> 49:25.649
Excuse me.

49:27.040 --> 49:28.960
And give them that radiant voice of yours

49:29.040 --> 49:30.840
in the next half hour.

49:30.920 --> 49:32.120
2:00 PM.

49:32.200 --> 49:34.760
Almost breakfast time in Japan.

49:34.840 --> 49:38.128
Oh, okay. Ah, doodily doodily doodily doo.

49:55.160 --> 49:56.880
- <i>Moshi moshi.</i>
- Mr. Son.

49:56.960 --> 49:59.000
Cassius Green of WorryFree calling.
Sorry to bother you.

49:59.080 --> 50:01.447
I'm calling about who
is assembling your phone.

50:01.560 --> 50:03.449
Now I know they're being made in China.

50:03.560 --> 50:04.720
I'm a big fan of yours.

50:04.800 --> 50:06.680
I've been following you
since you were with Takashi.

50:06.760 --> 50:09.680
I cheered literally when
I found out you acquired Tanrio,

50:09.760 --> 50:12.560
which is why I'm calling you
and not Phonarolla.

50:12.640 --> 50:13.641
Mm-hmm.

50:16.520 --> 50:18.480
Our team of dedicated workers

50:18.560 --> 50:21.200
will make twice as many phones
at half the cost.

50:21.280 --> 50:23.240
You'll double up your market share

50:23.320 --> 50:24.480
over these bastards.

50:28.800 --> 50:31.400
Power Callers, our very own Cassius Green

50:31.480 --> 50:33.280
just made our client, WorryFree,

50:33.360 --> 50:34.880
upwards of ten million dollars

50:34.960 --> 50:37.680
in one call on his first day, none the less.

50:37.760 --> 50:40.570
- Oh, it's not that much.
- Indeed one for the history books.

50:40.680 --> 50:42.091
Cheers!

50:44.120 --> 50:45.840
Excuse me for a second.

50:45.920 --> 50:47.480
What can I do for you, chum?

50:47.560 --> 50:48.720
Yes, I have a question.

50:48.800 --> 50:52.040
I've just achieved a sort of
miraculous financial endeavor.

50:52.120 --> 50:55.120
I'm also in a financial bind.

50:55.200 --> 50:57.280
I'm gonna need a cash advance.

50:57.360 --> 50:58.361
Hmm.

52:34.960 --> 52:37.600
<i>This is where the magic happens, baby.</i>

52:37.680 --> 52:40.280
<i>MTV spots WorryFree edition.</i>

52:40.360 --> 52:43.045
<i>Hole puncher Jim Ellman.</i>

52:51.600 --> 52:53.800
<i>This was the scene yesterday</i>

52:53.880 --> 52:56.120
<i>at the RegalView telemarketer's strike.</i>

52:56.200 --> 52:58.120
<i>The striking RegalView workers</i>

53:10.320 --> 53:11.640
<i>you feel me?</i>

53:11.720 --> 53:13.000
<i>We ready to eat.</i>

53:13.080 --> 53:15.162
<i>This is where we get our grub on.</i>

53:18.040 --> 53:20.200
<i>Mm-mm!</i>

53:20.280 --> 53:21.407
<i>Yum.</i>

53:23.600 --> 53:25.920
<i>Swimming through the vat of hyena urine</i>

53:26.000 --> 53:27.604
<i>is not as bad as it sounds!</i>

53:28.800 --> 53:29.960
<i>What do we want!?</i>

53:30.040 --> 53:32.240
<i>We want enough money to pay our rent!</i>

53:32.320 --> 53:33.840
<i>Yeah! Yeah!</i>

53:33.920 --> 53:38.200
<i>We want enough money to not eat
Cup 'O Noodles every night!</i>

53:38.280 --> 53:39.247
<i>Yeah! Yeah!</i>

53:39.360 --> 53:41.320
<i>I'm so sick of Cup 'O Noodles!</i>

53:41.400 --> 53:43.720
<i>We want to be able to go see our doctor</i>

53:43.800 --> 53:45.720
<i>when we get drunk one night!</i>

53:45.800 --> 53:47.800
<i>Yeah! Yeah!</i>

53:47.880 --> 53:51.931
<i>When we hook up with someone
without using any protection!</i>

53:52.040 --> 53:53.760
<i>Okay. Okay, yeah!</i>

53:53.840 --> 53:58.120
<i>And we think we might have
contracted chlamydia or gonorrhea!</i>

53:58.200 --> 54:01.080
<i>Or any one of those crazy
STDs that you've never heard of</i>

54:01.160 --> 54:04.120
<i>that you find on Self-Diagnosis.com!</i>

54:11.160 --> 54:12.240
<i>Fuck RegalView!</i>

54:13.640 --> 54:14.971
<i>Fuck RegalView!</i>

54:16.640 --> 54:19.760
<i>Fuck RegalView! Fuck RegalView!</i>

54:19.840 --> 54:21.360
<i>Fuck RegalView!</i>

54:21.440 --> 54:23.960
<i>Fuck RegalView! Fuck RegalView!</i>

54:24.040 --> 54:25.640
<i>And fuck chlamydia, too.</i>

54:25.720 --> 54:28.960
<i>Although strikers have kept
most replacement workers</i>

54:29.040 --> 54:30.480
<i>from breaking the strike</i>

54:30.560 --> 54:34.520
<i>every morning, Stackwater security agents
successfully escort</i>

54:34.600 --> 54:38.160
<i>RegalView's elite Power Callers
into the building.</i>

54:38.240 --> 54:39.810
<i>For more on the RegalView strike,</i>

54:39.920 --> 54:41.480
<i>let's go to the studio.</i>

54:41.560 --> 54:43.847
<i>This is Ken Bagget. Chanel 3 news.</i>

54:50.400 --> 54:52.080
Hey baby. Good morning.

54:52.160 --> 54:53.960
No. Please, no.

54:54.040 --> 54:56.200
Stop with that stupid voice, Cassius.

54:58.080 --> 55:00.606
Didn't even realize I was doing it.

55:02.880 --> 55:04.484
That's a problem, you know.

55:05.640 --> 55:06.641
Sorry.

55:08.920 --> 55:10.365
How long you been up?

55:12.480 --> 55:13.481
I'm not up.

55:18.080 --> 55:20.640
But I saw your TV debut.

55:20.720 --> 55:22.290
Oh, shit.

55:25.360 --> 55:28.603
- Cash, baby...
- Can we not. Please.

55:28.720 --> 55:31.280
Look, I quit when the strike jumped off

55:31.360 --> 55:33.840
because being with you
made it awkward for me. But...

55:33.920 --> 55:35.800
Cassius!

55:35.880 --> 55:38.000
You abandoned your friends.

55:38.080 --> 55:40.520
Baby, look, I thought they'd
do a couple of stoppages and...

55:40.600 --> 55:42.160
It's one thing to take the promotion,

55:42.240 --> 55:44.120
but now you're a full out scab.

55:44.200 --> 55:46.203
Come on, baby,
the Power Callers ain't on strike!

55:46.320 --> 55:48.080
No, but they should be.

55:48.160 --> 55:50.200
I'm so tired of talking to you about this.

55:50.280 --> 55:51.560
You are crossing the picket line.

55:51.640 --> 55:52.800
I can't ride with you.

55:52.880 --> 55:54.560
Oh, you can't ride with me now!

55:54.640 --> 55:56.160
But you was riding with me
all around Oakland.

55:56.240 --> 55:58.800
Alright, fine. Well, no more.

55:58.880 --> 56:01.320
Baby, what are you asking me to do?

56:01.400 --> 56:03.280
Are you asking me to quit
the fattest job I ever had?

56:03.360 --> 56:04.880
But Cassius, it's not fat!

56:04.960 --> 56:07.327
It is morally emaciated.

56:08.320 --> 56:10.240
You sell fucking slave labor, Cassius!

56:10.320 --> 56:12.000
What the fuck isn't slave labor?

56:12.080 --> 56:13.280
Oh, my God! Side-stepping.

56:13.360 --> 56:15.840
You side-step more
than the fucking Temptations.

56:17.920 --> 56:20.720
You know what, fuck you, man!

56:20.800 --> 56:21.840
Fuck you, alright!

56:21.920 --> 56:23.160
Fuck you 'cause I'm doing something

56:23.240 --> 56:24.321
that I'm really fucking good at.

56:24.440 --> 56:25.920
I'm really good at it and I'm important.

56:26.000 --> 56:27.160
I'm making shit happen.

56:27.240 --> 56:28.520
And you don't appreciate the shit

56:28.600 --> 56:29.720
cause you already fucking had it.

56:29.800 --> 56:31.560
And you're talking to me about slave labor?

56:31.640 --> 56:33.440
What is Squeeze and them
gonna do about slave labor?

56:33.520 --> 56:34.840
What does Squeeze have to do with this?

56:34.920 --> 56:35.967
They ain't gonna do shit.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.440
And you ain't gonna do shit neither

56:38.520 --> 56:41.080
by selling fucking art to rich people.

56:41.160 --> 56:42.321
Fuck it.

56:46.160 --> 56:47.730
Gimme the damn covers!

56:48.920 --> 56:50.200
- What you doing?
- Taking them.

56:50.280 --> 56:51.560
- I'm cold.
- I'm not playing Cassius.

56:51.640 --> 56:53.440
- You're being greedy.
- Don't play with me, Cassius.

56:53.520 --> 56:56.808
You don't even need all those covers.
It's not necessary.

57:08.640 --> 57:11.440
The whole reason I went to work for RegalView

57:11.520 --> 57:13.488
was to make myself more interesting to you.

57:16.200 --> 57:18.931
Cassius, the old you
was way more interesting.

57:22.960 --> 57:24.600
If you go to work today at RegalView

57:24.680 --> 57:25.966
crossing the picket line...

57:28.040 --> 57:29.644
we're done.

57:32.480 --> 57:34.448
Elbows and assholes, people! Let's go!

57:39.600 --> 57:42.160
Chisels or dynamite, Cassius. You pick.

57:42.240 --> 57:44.120
Yeah, agreed. I just have to follow up

57:44.200 --> 57:45.565
on this lead I've been working on.

57:58.120 --> 58:00.840
This motherfucker right here...

58:00.920 --> 58:03.200
is on fire!

58:03.280 --> 58:05.600
Let's give it up for the boy wonder!

58:05.680 --> 58:07.680
Huzzah!

58:07.760 --> 58:09.680
Yeah, yeah! Some for the homeys.

58:09.760 --> 58:11.120
And some for me!

58:11.200 --> 58:13.440
Bag them, tag them, rag them!

58:13.520 --> 58:15.040
I trained her. I trained her.

58:15.120 --> 58:19.200
- We hunted mammoths!
- Yeah!

58:19.280 --> 58:22.921
Douse him. Douse our winner with champagne.

58:26.640 --> 58:27.801
##

58:48.120 --> 58:49.560
Scabs won't pass!

58:49.640 --> 58:52.320
Scabs won't pass! Scabs won't pass!

58:52.400 --> 58:54.080
Scabs won't pass!

58:54.160 --> 58:56.731
Scabs won't pass! Scabs won't pass!

58:58.880 --> 58:59.881
Move!

59:03.600 --> 59:04.761
I said get back!

59:06.720 --> 59:08.840
Have a cola and smile, bitch!

59:14.720 --> 59:16.680
Thank you very much, Miss Welcrott.

59:16.760 --> 59:18.880
I'll talk to you soon. Mm-hmm.

59:18.960 --> 59:20.166
Okay, bye.

59:21.760 --> 59:23.160
You, my friend,

59:23.240 --> 59:27.280
you are the best decision
I've made in quite a long time.

59:27.360 --> 59:28.760
I have to pat myself on the ass for that.

59:28.840 --> 59:31.520
Thank you, Mister.

59:31.600 --> 59:33.600
Feels good to be appreciated.

59:33.680 --> 59:36.684
Don't call me Mr. , Cassius.

59:36.800 --> 59:38.200
Call me.

59:38.280 --> 59:40.200
Million-dollar question for you, Cassius.

59:40.280 --> 59:42.720
Do you like to party?

59:42.800 --> 59:45.120
I like parties.

59:45.200 --> 59:46.600
What are you doing tonight?

59:46.680 --> 59:48.160
Oh, I got this thing.

59:48.240 --> 59:50.160
Well my girlfriend, ex-girlfriend...

59:50.240 --> 59:51.321
Fudge all that.

59:58.280 --> 59:59.760
Hmm!

59:59.840 --> 01:00:01.840
Steve Lift is throwing his yearly party.

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.360
Wants to see our new star there.

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:04.880
Wants to talk to you, Cassius.

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:06.724
I have been waiting years for this invite.

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:10.040
Even Jay and Bey can't get this invite.

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:14.000
Hell yeah. I just got to do this other thing.

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:15.600
You go to your other thing.

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:18.251
And I'll be there waiting. Pick you up.

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:20.763
This is the kind of party
that could change your life.

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:40.520
Beauty, love, and laughter,

01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:44.920
must be stimulated to thrive and flourish
under almost any circumstances...

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.560
I realize you were
asking about specific... that one.

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:51.405
Yes, that's interesting.

01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:01.847
You know what,
will you please excuse me just one minute?

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:11.480
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:13.840
I wouldn't miss this for the world, you know.

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.520
It's beautiful.

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:17.560
- You're beautiful.
- Cash...

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:18.920
I love you too...

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.560
but I can't hang with what I see in you now.

01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:23.240
What happened to your head?

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:24.320
Oh, um...

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:27.840
It's nothing. I was just shaving...

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:30.520
Alright, I have to go get ready
for my performance.

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:32.440
You should really stay and see it, okay?

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:34.320
Okay, but I can only stay
for a little while, baby,

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:36.640
cause there's this party
I got to get back to. It's important.

01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:38.280
A slave auctioneers party?

01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:41.040
- Hey.
- Yo, what's up?

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:42.200
Thank you for coming.

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:44.480
I wouldn't miss this for the world.

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:46.360
You always know just what to say, huh?

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:48.280
I literally just said that.

01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:50.680
I hope you stay.

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:52.320
Yo, is the reason why
you don't call me no more

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:56.400
is cause you sell out or
cause you're just a star?

01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:57.960
What are you talking about?

01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:59.724
Eleven million views, man!

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:02.120
What the fuck?

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:04.123
You're like the Ariana Grande
of disloyal niggas.

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:06.600
<i>Have a cola and smile, bitch!</i>

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:12.520
You could really help us out right now.

01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:14.480
We got them by the balls,
but they're holding out.

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:16.520
We got the info on how much
this is costing them.

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:20.240
You flipping sides could turn the tide.

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:22.721
Don't be the leaf that floats down the river.

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:24.524
Be the stone that splits the stream.

01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:27.240
Is that Tupac?

01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:38.600
Welcome, friends! Gather around,

01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:40.364
form a semi-circle.

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:46.560
Tonight, we will have a
transformative experience.

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:48.320
In those containers,

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:50.680
there are broken cell phones,
used bullet casings,

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:53.160
and water balloons filled with sheep's blood.

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:55.891
Cellphones can only work
with the mineral Coltan,

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.600
which is found in Africa's Congo.

01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:02.960
The profit involved in this
has created hardship and wars.

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:04.840
I will stand here.

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:06.400
If you feel so moved,

01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:09.080
you may throw the items
in the containers at me.

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:10.760
While I'm standing here,

01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:12.360
I will be reciting excerpts

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:17.680
from the timeless
Motown-produced movie entitled

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.160
"The Last Dragon".

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:22.880
I'll recite those lines
Angela says to Eddie Arcadian

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.963
as she leaves him.

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:28.287
Let's begin.

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:39.520
"And in the end, Eddie, you know what?

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:43.200
"You're nothing but a misguided
midget asshole

01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:45.600
"with dreams of ruling the world.

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:48.840
"Yeah, and also from Kew Gardens.

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:53.080
And also getting by on my tits."

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:54.161
Bravo!

01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:01.520
"And in the end, Eddie, you know what?

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:05.400
"You're nothing
but a misguided midget asshole

01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:07.520
"with dreams of ruling the world.

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.125
"And also from Kew Gardens.

01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:12.608
And also getting by on my tits."

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:22.080
"And in the end, Eddie, you know what?

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:24.640
"You're nothing but a mis...

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:28.520
"misguided midget asshole

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:31.920
"with dreams of ruling the world.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000
"Yeah, also from Kew Gardens.

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:37.320
And also getting by on my tits."

01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:39.640
Hey, hey, hey! Stop!

01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:41.080
What the fuck is this?

01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:42.840
Why would you subject yourself to this?

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:45.160
It's a part of the show, Cassius.

01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:47.208
You of all people should understand, right?

01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:49.480
- Stick to the script.
- No.

01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:52.131
Don't you have a party to get to, Cash?

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:53.241
Go!

01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:56.244
Go, Cash.

01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:08.289
Let's begin again.

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:12.642
"And in the end, Eddie..."

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:34.520
Well, I guess you're all wondering

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:35.727
why I've called this meeting!

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:45.680
Hey. Hey.

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:48.360
Fucking sexy chocolate motherfucker!

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:51.880
- Oh, yes!
- Cool guy.

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:53.160
- You're coming with me.
- You're a cool guy.

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:54.880
I know you're loving the new digs.

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:57.725
Or even better, I'm digging the new loves.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.400
Stick around because...

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:01.640
I think a lot of these bitches

01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:03.040
are gonna be getting naked later.

01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:05.600
You know, I mean,
your parties are the stuff of folklore.

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:07.640
You got to meet the man of the hour though.

01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:10.120
Hey, Cassius Green.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:12.120
An honor even, sir.

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:14.240
It's okay, he's friendly. He's friendly.

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:15.720
Oh, yeah, how you doing man? You alright?

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:17.040
I'm really well, thank you.

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:19.360
Thank you for inviting us, Mr. Lift.
It's amazing.

01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:21.720
Just don't call me "Mister."

01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:24.120
Oh, uh... Steve.

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:25.725
I never said "Steve."

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:28.681
Sir.

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:34.320
- I'm fucking kidding with you, man.
- Ow! Ow!

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:35.960
You can call me whatever you want,

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:37.610
you keep closing those deals.

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:40.600
You must be like a fucking genius.

01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:41.960
I'd love to pick your brain

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:43.840
because we need people like you at WorryFree.

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:46.651
People who can comprehend
the big picture, you know?

01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:49.920
It's people like you that are
gonna save this nation.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.160
I mean look don't get me wrong;

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:52.840
we still need the workers to do the work.

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:54.040
Per se.

01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:55.680
But we also need people like you.

01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:57.046
People that can be trusted.

01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:01.520
People that can analyze
the challenge and adapt.

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:03.603
Like a cunning racoon.

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:06.480
Like a snake.

01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:08.005
Or like a tardigrade!

01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:13.201
Thanks...

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:17.568
Go, I'll lock up.

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:20.726
Great performance tonight, D!

01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:23.840
I told you, you didn't have to do that.

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:26.002
No, it's my pleasure. It was good.

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:33.484
So, you gonna tell me what
you thought about the show now?

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:37.362
It was, uh...

01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:40.160
fiery.

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:42.400
Fiery? What the fuck?

01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:43.920
That's what you thought? That's it?

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.040
It was fiery. It was great.

01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:48.521
Alright. Shh, you can tell me later.

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:56.800
So now, I gotta climb over the side
of this overturned jeep

01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:58.160
cause I got to pry the AK out

01:07:58.240 --> 01:07:59.760
from under the crushed bloody body

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:02.320
of my now inconveniently
deceased guide, right?

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:04.120
And just as I get this thing out
I spin around.

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:05.880
And this fucking thing
starts to charge and it got a...

01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:14.520
Fucker took two mags to the head.

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:15.965
Turned that bitch into a trophy.

01:08:18.359 --> 01:08:19.840
What about you, Cash?

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:22.000
You ever had to bust a cap in anybody's ass?

01:08:23.479 --> 01:08:25.840
- Green, no...
- Shut the fuck up,!

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:27.800
I'm talking to the man of the hour here.

01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:29.245
Come on man, have a seat.

01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:31.841
Come on.

01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:36.040
I want to hear about some of that
Oakland gangster shit, man.

01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:38.040
- Oaktown.
- Just right here?

01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:39.645
- Just sit down?
- Yeah.

01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:41.760
Well...

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:46.960
Luckily, I have not had
to put a cap in anyone's ass.

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.680
Or head or anything.

01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:52.367
So, I don't have any cool stories, sorry.

01:08:52.479 --> 01:08:56.246
Alright, well I mean
give us something. Right?

01:08:56.359 --> 01:08:59.170
These boring cunts are at
every single one of my parties.

01:08:59.279 --> 01:09:01.800
You're different, man. Make an impression.

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:03.479
At least take off the white voice.

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:05.560
And I know you can bust a rap, right?

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:07.120
No, actually I can't.

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:08.600
Bullshit. Come on. Bullshit.

01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:09.680
I can't, man.

01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:12.680
I mean I can listen to rap,
well, but I just can't rap.

01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:14.080
It's actually embarrassing.

01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:15.439
I don't know. I think he's lying.

01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:16.680
I think you can rap.

01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:18.359
I think you should rap.

01:09:18.439 --> 01:09:20.120
Rap, rap, rap...

01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:23.439
Rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap.

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:25.200
Rap, rap, rap.

01:09:25.279 --> 01:09:28.720
Rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap.

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:30.404
Rap, rap, rap.

01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:33.840
Rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap.

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:34.921

Go through that big ass foyer.

01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:55.200
Go through the door next to the stairs.

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:57.886
Go down the other stairs. Hang a left.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.120
Go to the end of the hallway.

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:01.600
Then make a right.

01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:03.762
You'll see it.

01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:06.040
Big magenta colored doors
at the end of the hall.

01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:07.480
Steve Lift will be waiting for you.

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:08.561
He wants you in there.

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:14.640
Look here, young blood. We don't cry
about the shit that should be.

01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:17.000
We just thrive on what is and what is...

01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:18.366
opportunity.

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:21.684
This could be big, Cassius.

01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:25.282
Don't do that thing.

01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:27.767
- What thing?
- That thing where you fuck it up.

01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:32.000
Clean yourself up.

01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:40.080
##

01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:49.761
Heads up.

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:54.084
This place is fucking nuts, man.

01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:56.043
Thank you. I will accept
your backhanded compliment.

01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:58.811
Please. Take a seat, Mr. Cassius Green.

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:06.000
- How's your head, you alright?
- No, it's perfect.

01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:08.480
Well, here, in this lair

01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:10.080
we do no line before its time.

01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:12.240
And for you, my friend, it is time.

01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:15.920
Cause you are rolling with the big dogs now.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.411
Fuck it!

01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:30.120
Fuck! It's strong, man!

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:33.480
Oh, yeah. I have a proposition for you, Cash.

01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:36.800
And I want to listen to your
proposition, Stevie.

01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:40.720
I want you at WorryFree.

01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:42.680
I see something in you.

01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:44.280
I think that you are more

01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:45.960
than just the world's greatest telemarketer

01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:47.440
since Hal Jameson.

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:49.520
You know what that's very interesting.

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:50.560
Boring, though.

01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:52.440
I want to talk about the dollars

01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:54.000
and zeros and the commas and shit.

01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:55.720
Cocky. I like it.

01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:57.520
Watch this little video proposal
we put together

01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:59.200
and you'll understand everything. Alright?

01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:06.720
You know, I kind of got to piss.

01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:08.200
So, could we, like, kind of watch this

01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:09.560
after I get back from the bathroom?

01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:10.641
No.

01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:17.640
Hella gotta piss, man.

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:19.400
Okay fine. Out the door,

01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:21.320
halfway down the hallway, jade door.

01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:22.561
Jade door, okay.

01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:37.407
Okay...

01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:41.121
Wow...

01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:43.161
Alright...

01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:48.200
Serious?

01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:49.486
One stall.

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:53.760
Hey, you on your way in or out, man?

01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:55.171
Can you help me?

01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:00.320
No. No, I can't. Sorry.

01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:02.600
Please. Could you help me?

01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:05.650
Fucked up, man. I'm really hurt.

01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:12.043
Oh, shit. Okay.

01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:14.885
Just hold on, man.

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:17.921
##

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:24.800
- Please... help me.
- Fuck!

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:27.840
Help me! Help me!

01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:35.360
No, no, no, no, no, no! Don't touch me.

01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:37.602
- Help us!
- Help me!

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:45.240
Hey, dumb fuck!

01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:47.721
What the fuck, man!

01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:51.800
- I said the jade door.
- That is the jade door.

01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:53.040
No, that's an olive door.

01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:54.400
That's very clearly an olive door.

01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:55.600
That's a jade door.

01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:57.400
Look, you got to get me the fuck out of here.

01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:00.643
Okay, calm, calm. This is
a big misunderstanding. Okay?

01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:02.280
Let's just take a deep breath and calm down.

01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:03.480
We're gonna go back to my office.

01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:05.080
I'm gonna explain everything to you, alright?

01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:06.360
Wait, do you still have to pee?

01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:08.360
I mean, I pissed on myself, man.

01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:10.280
So, no I don't have to pee.

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:11.840
Look, I got to get the fuck out of here.

01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:13.001
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:16.800
Here's the deal.

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:20.120
I can't let you leave without
explaining everything. Alright?

01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:21.520
And if you'd even seen the video

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:23.520
before you went in there
you wouldn't even be scared.

01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:25.967
What the fuck was that thing in there, man?

01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:28.241
It's...

01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:33.440
the video is gonna show you everything.

01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:34.726
Don't worry about it.

01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:44.201
There's a lot of production value in this.

01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:56.720
<i>Since the dawn of time,</i>

01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:59.720
<i>or least since before anyone
cares to remember,</i>

01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:02.121
<i>we have used our wits to survive.</i>

01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:06.720
<i>But what has allowed us to thrive</i>

01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:09.080
<i>was our use of tools.</i>

01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:11.288
<i>A natural development.</i>

01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:16.000
<i>But what are tools</i>

01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:18.000
<i>if not extensions of the appendages</i>

01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:19.241
<i>with which we were born?</i>

01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:23.686
<i>Humans have modified ourselves
throughout history.</i>

01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:27.920
<i>We train ourselves to fight.</i>

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.960
<i>We work out.</i>

01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:31.600
<i>We study.</i>

01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:34.160
<i>WorryFree is carrying forward this lineage</i>

01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:37.642
<i>of natural developments
that began in prehistoric times.</i>

01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:44.650
<i>We realize that human labor
has its limitations.</i>

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.840
<i>And, so, our scientists
have discovered a way.</i>

01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:54.080
<i>A chemical change to make humans stronger,</i>

01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:56.120
<i>more obedient, more durable</i>

01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:59.480
<i>and therefore more efficient and profitable.</i>

01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:02.240
<i>We are proud to announce to our shareholders</i>

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:07.000
<i>that a new day in human
productivity is dawning.</i>

01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:09.040
<i>Our workforce of Equisapiens</i>

01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:10.120
<i>will make WorryFree</i>

01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:13.443
<i>the most profitable company in human history.</i>

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:16.560
<i>And you, our shareholders,</i>

01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:19.080
<i>will be a part of that history.</i>

01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:22.080
See? It's all just a big misunderstanding.

01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:25.360
This ain't no fucking misunderstanding, man!

01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:29.680
So, you making half-human,
half-horse fucking things

01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:31.160
so you can make more money?

01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:32.480
Yeah, basically.

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:35.120
I just didn't want you to think I was crazy.

01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:36.560
That I was doing this for no reason.

01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:39.000
Because this isn't irrational.

01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:40.480
Oh.

01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:41.766
Cool. Alright.

01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:43.120
Cool. No, I understand.

01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:44.920
I just... I just got to leave now, man.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.920
So, please get the fuck out of my way.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:48.040
We haven't finished the movie.

01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:49.480
Call me about that next week, please.

01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:51.080
And then we'll talk about it.

01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:53.200
Sit in that chair

01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:55.240
and we're gonna watch this movie.

01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:57.084
And then I'm gonna make you a proposal.

01:19:58.280 --> 01:19:59.566
Come on.

01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:07.880
<i>Our worker modification process</i>

01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:09.803
<i>is simple and rather quick.</i>

01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:17.888
<i>It works for 70% of humans</i>

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.003
<i>who take the fusing catalyst.</i>

01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:36.840
And, see, this is how we begin

01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:38.120
the process of the transformation.

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:40.407
They take what's called the
fusing catalyst. And what happens is...

01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:42.240
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait a minute, man.

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:45.160
What the fuck did you give me to snort? Huh?

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:47.000
What the... what the fuck was that?

01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:48.400
- Wait, what?
- What did I snort?!

01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:49.720
Cause I'm, I'm not even fucking high.

01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:51.720
You're not what? Wait, wait wait. Wait.

01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:54.440
No, I don't give a fuck
about that anymore, alright?

01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:55.760
I don't give a fuck about that shit.

01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:57.080
If you had me snort some shit

01:20:57.160 --> 01:20:58.320
that's gonna have me mutated, man,

01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:00.040
I want you to fucking shoot me!

01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:03.400
Cash. What you snorted was
100% Peruvian, man.

01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:05.200
I need you to be a little bit
more particular, man.

01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:08.080
You know, they got fucking
horses in Peru, probably.

01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:11.040
- Motherfucker!
- You're gonna get semantic on me?

01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:12.200
No, I'm not getting semantic.

01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:13.680
You're the one that's being semantic

01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:15.480
if you refer to the fucking horses as a 100%.

01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:17.040
Fuck that. It doesn't even matter.

01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:18.360
Was it coke? Was it not coke?

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:21.200
- What was it?
- Cash. It was coke.

01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:23.280
Calm down, man.

01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:25.080
You're... I wouldn't just give you

01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:26.760
the fusing catalyst without telling you.

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:29.080
I'm not evil. Okay?

01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:30.600
The reason you're not high

01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:33.440
is because your adrenaline
is pumping so hard right now

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:34.960
that to be perfectly honest

01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:37.840
you're starting to harsh both
of our mellows. Okay?

01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:40.680
So, sit down and just take a breath, man.

01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:41.760
It's fucking adrenaline.

01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:43.720
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:45.960
It's fine, okay. Just breathe.

01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:46.802
Okay?

01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:49.640
This is fucking weird shit.

01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:51.600
Okay?

01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:55.685
Now, the proposal that
I want to make you is this...

01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:59.560
That is the future of labor. Okay?

01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:01.640
They're bigger. They're stronger.

01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:03.240
They hopefully gripe a lot less.

01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:07.240
And also, soon, I'm gonna
have millions of them.

01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:08.360
Fucking crazy...

01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:10.080
They're gonna form their own society.

01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:12.000
They'll probably form their own culture.

01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:13.680
Then maybe they want to organize.

01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:15.200
Maybe they want to rebel.

01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:18.520
And that's why we need someone on the inside

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:21.922
who represents WorryFree's needs.

01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:24.088
Someone they can relate to.

01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:27.320
Talking about a manager

01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:28.920
for fucking horse people.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.120
No. No.

01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:36.160
The Equisapien Martin Luther King, Junior.

01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:38.640
But one that we create.

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:40.600
One that we control.

01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:43.760
So, you want to...
want to have a false leader

01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:45.800
for these fucking horse people.

01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:48.160
But at the same time, he works for you?

01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:50.527
Yeah. Keeps shit simple.

01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:55.480
Well, why the fuck did you choose me?

01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:57.880
Out of everybody you could have chose,
why did you pick me?

01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:00.400
- For what?
- Cash. Cash.

01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:04.080
You are awesome.

01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:06.520
I've never seen anyone go through the ranks

01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:08.600
at RegalView like you did.

01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:11.880
And I want someone like that at WorryFree.

01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:13.240
Someone hungry.

01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:15.480
Someone who'll fucking shank
their own friend in the back

01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:17.920
if it means getting what they want.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.840
Now, look, I can see that you're freaked out.

01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:23.160
And that you want to say no.

01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:25.846
But I wouldn't do that before
you see what I'm offering.

01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:34.680
No, man. No, no.

01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:36.125
There's no fucking amount of money

01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:37.640
that will make me do that shit.

01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:38.920
Two things.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.800
One: it's a short-term contract.

01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:42.840
Five years. Done.

01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:44.640
Then we give you the diffuser antidote

01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:46.040
special sauce serum

01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:47.440
and you're back to normal.

01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:51.040
And the second one,
and I want you to remember this.

01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:53.407
You're gonna have a horse cock.

01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:59.040
What the fuck is a special antidote
sauce serum? What the f...

01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:01.566
It sounds like you made that shit up, man.
That shit ain't real.

01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:04.400
No, it's real. And so is my offer.

01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:07.200
Five years as our man amongst horses.

01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:09.851
For one hundred million dollars.

01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:13.040
Just go sleep on it. Okay?

01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:16.727
And after that, holla at your boy. Okay?

01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:20.610
Get out in that party and go fuck something.

01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:52.804
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:57.966
Fuck! Fuck!

01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:11.563
Where's my cell phone?

01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:21.280
<i>San Francisco Chronicle, good morning.</i>

01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:23.200
Um... Eric. Eric Arnold, please.

01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:24.281
<i>One moment.</i>

01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:27.080
<i>Hello.</i>

01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:30.000
Okay, Eric Arnold. My name is Cassius Green.

01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:32.367
I have some important information.

01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:33.880
Some very, very important information

01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:36.880
that I think you would really,
really be interested in.

01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:40.880
- <i>Okay, shoot.</i>
- Okay, uh... alright.

01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:43.960
They turning motherfuckers into horse-people.

01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:47.280
Horse... half-horse, half-human
people that work. Alright.

01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:49.400
Look, they have you snort some fucking coke,

01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:50.600
and, well, it's not really coke,

01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:53.040
but you snort it and it has
your nostrils get all big

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:54.480
and then you get a horse dick and shit.

01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:57.880
And listen... listen, you got
to get this story out here, man,

01:25:57.960 --> 01:25:59.840
because look, you put...

01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:00.960
<i>Jake?</i>

01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:03.800
What you talking about? No. Cassius.

01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:05.564
Cassius Green.

01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:11.040
<i>The first thing we're gonna do</i>

01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:13.771
<i>is cut a little nib into the cola can.</i>

01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:23.330
<i>Voila!"Have a cola and smile, bitch," wig!</i>

01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:29.285
Fuck! Where the fuck is my cellphone?!

01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:33.320
<i>And the strangest thing</i>

01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:34.845
<i>to happen in advertising history</i>

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:37.120
<i>Soda Cola has announced
working with Cynthia Rose,</i>

01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:39.840
<i>the foul-mouthed heroine with perfect aim</i>

<i>from the "Cola-and-Smile-Bitch" YouTube clip.</i>

01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:44.480
<i>Rose reportedly signed for an amount of money</i>

01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:46.400
<i>that could buy four white babies.</i>

<i>The strike breaker who's hilariously
pegged in that clip</i>

<i>has been revealed to be named...</i>

- Cassius Green.
- <i>Cassius Green.</i>

01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:54.000
Alright Doc, now I'm, uh...

01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:55.520
I got a little worried, you know.

01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:57.480
Because I was looking at it
maybe from up here.

01:26:57.560 --> 01:26:59.480
But that it might be different.

01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:00.766
Is it bigger?

01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:05.480
No. No, it's the same size.

01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:07.040
I mean, I'm glad you're feeling yourself.

01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:09.360
Is that why you tried to
booty call me last night?

01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:12.760
I didn't try to booty call you.
I lost my phone. I told you.

01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:14.560
It doesn't matter. I got a new one.

01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:16.160
What is up with you, Cash?

01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:18.480
You called me at 3:23.
You left a video message.

01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:19.520
I didn't check it,

01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:21.920
cause I assumed it was lewd as fuck
and I wasn't trying to do that...

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.127
Can I see that?

01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:25.567
Come on.

01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:37.520
<i>We're hurting! We're hurting!</i>

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:39.364
<i>Help us! Help us!</i>

01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:41.560
<i>Get back in there. Get in there.</i>

01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:42.926
<i>Please help us!</i>

01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:46.285
<i>We're hurting!</i>

01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:49.200
Security code cleared.

01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:50.560
<i>Love of Christ.</i>

01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:52.961
<i>If you beautiful perversions
don't shut the fuck up,</i>

01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:55.481
<i>I will turn you all into glue!</i>

01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:58.165
Found my phone.

01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:10.800
I don't know, Cash...

01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:13.440
You got to do something. People got to know.

01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:15.760
Right? Honey, you got to tell them, right?

01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:16.887
Yeah. Yeah I mean...

01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:19.720
- Why did you show...
- I don't know, alright.

01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:21.040
I snorted something that was...

01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:22.400
I thought it was activated

01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:24.200
but it turned out it was just coke...

01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:26.000
But why did you focus on your dick, though?

01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:27.320
They have big nostrils

01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:29.164
you could have just asked me
to check your nostrils.

01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:30.850
- Okay check 'em, check 'em.
- Okay, okay.

01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:33.520
Yeah, they look bigger.

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:35.240
- No, they don't.
- I think that's just cause...

01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:37.160
- Yeah. You're flaring them.
- No, I'm not flaring them.

01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:38.480
- You are, you are.
- No, I'm not.

01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:40.051
Just relax them a little bit so I can see.

01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:44.600
Okay. Look, listen. They're normal size.
They look normal size.

01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:46.205
They look normal size.

01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:09.800
I need you to know...

01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:12.040
I want to be clear...

01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:13.800
this can't happen again.

01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:15.560
I'm not going back.

01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:18.120
I'm not going to be a fucking Power Caller.

01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:19.930
That's a good decision.

01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:21.320
But I...

01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:23.280
- I still have problems with all this.
- I'm not...

01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:25.360
Only something happening to you
turned you against them.

01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:27.080
Okay. But I know how they view me.

01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:29.240
How I look in the eyes

01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:31.160
of fucking WorryFree and RegalView.

01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:34.680
They just view me as another one
of their fucking creatures

01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:37.525
to control and to manipulate.
And that's not me.

01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:40.721
Good.

01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:43.281
Good.

01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:48.324
That doesn't change what I said about us.

01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:52.880
And also, I kind of messed around

01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:53.920
with somebody last night.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.650
What? Wait...

01:29:56.640 --> 01:29:58.480
what do you mean you kind of...

01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:00.120
I need you to explain that one

01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:01.200
cause I don't understand

01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:05.126
what you mean by you kind of
messed around with somebody.

01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:09.280
- I mean did you...
- Everything but.

01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:10.440
Everything but.

01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:11.681
You see, that's almost worse than

01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:13.360
anything I can imagine in my mind.

01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:17.445
- Everything but. So, did you...
- Cassius, we were broken up.

01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:20.680
Okay? It's over.

01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:23.081
It's me and you that shouldn't have
messed around tonight.

01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:35.443
You want to know who it was?

01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:39.320
Do you plan on fucking

01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:41.971
or "everything but" -ting
with that person again?

01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:44.281
No.

01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:49.171
Nah. No, I don't want to know, then.

01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:53.769
No, I don't want to know.

01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:05.245
##

01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:24.407
I have absolutely no idea what this is about.

01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:27.800
Maybe it's saying that
capitalism dehumanizes them.

01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:30.280
Maybe the artist is being literal.

01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:33.240
Maybe WorryFree is
turning workers into horses.

01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:35.163
And literally fucking them?

01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:40.720
##

01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:48.720
Hey, bro.

01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:50.120
Ain't you the dude from the clip

01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:51.640
that got hit in the head with the can?

01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:54.080
No. No, everybody thinks that's me, man.

01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:56.208
- But that's not me.
- What's wrong with your head then?

01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:57.720
Damn, everybody thinks that's...

01:31:57.800 --> 01:31:59.280
That's you, that shit is funny!

01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:02.364
- What the fuck, man?!
- Why you lyin'?

01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:14.361
That's alright.

01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:16.801
Happen to the best of us.

01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:22.801
Walk it off.

01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:33.160
This is Cassius Green

01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:35.480
from "Have-A-Cola-And-A-Smile-Bitch" fame.

01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:36.971
I want to be on your show tomorrow.

01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:42.491
<i>"Have a Cola and smile, Bitch"</i>

01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:56.440
"I Got the Shit Kicked Out Of Me".

01:32:56.520 --> 01:32:59.400
Today, YouTube sensation
Cassius Green is here.

01:32:59.480 --> 01:33:01.760
You had 500 million people

01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:03.040
watch you get pegged to the noggin

01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:05.440
and get utterly humiliated.
It was effin hilarious.

01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:07.200
The way your hair went up like that...

01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:10.760
The whole world is laughing 'til they pissed.

01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:15.080
Well, I got a new clip
that I need you to play

01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:16.880
and the only reason I came on the show

01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:18.760
was because you agreed to show this clip

01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:21.040
to your 150 million viewers.

01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:23.000
Well, if you want some ass,
you have to bring some ass.

01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:24.520
So, we'll get ready for an ass whipping,

01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:25.920
then jump in the shit tank.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.320
Then we'll play your clip.

01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:32.205
##

01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:49.560
Could you play my clip now, please?

01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:50.560
Okay.

01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:53.880
Is it as crazy as the
cola-and-a-smile-bitch clip?

01:33:53.960 --> 01:33:55.200
Not possible.

01:33:56.720 --> 01:33:58.800
It's crazy, Mary.

01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:01.360
- It's fucking crazy.
- Woo-hoo.

01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:02.920
Let's roll the clip.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.840
<i>Help us. We're hurting!</i>

01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:08.002
<i>We're hurting!</i>

01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:10.600
<i>If you beautiful perversions
don't shut the fuck up,</i>

01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:13.440
<i>I will turn you all into glue!</i>

01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:17.280
As a Power Caller for RegalView,

01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:19.960
WorryFree was my premier client.

01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:22.160
This is just incontrovertible proof

01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:24.280
of WorryFree's evil practices.

01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:27.320
They're turning humans into
grotesque horse-people.

01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:29.240
<i>And I want the world to know</i>

01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:32.280
<i>that... that... that they're
manipulating humanity</i>

01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:33.800
<i>for the sake of profit.</i>

01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:35.560
<i>Now, we cannot let this go on.</i>

01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:37.720
<i>You have to call your congressman, alright.</i>

01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:39.040
<i>Call your local politicians</i>

01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:41.480
<i>and let them know we will not stand for this.</i>

01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:42.920
<i>It's been one day</i>

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.200
<i>since the viral celebrity leak to the world,</i>

01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:48.240
<i>new scientific achievements made by WorryFree</i>

01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:50.360
<i>and their genius CEO, Steve Lift,</i>

01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:53.240
<i>which caused WorryFree stocks to sky rocket</i>

01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:56.120
<i>at a rate faster than any
other company in history.</i>

01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:57.640
<i>House and Senate leaders</i>

01:34:57.720 --> 01:34:59.370
<i>joined Lift in ringing the bell</i>

01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:01.920
<i>to celebrate the record stock market rally</i>

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:03.240
<i>WorryFree's success has created.</i>

01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:04.321
Fuck you!

01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:10.040
<i>We are all sinners,
but in every sinner lies a winner.</i>

01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:12.280
<i>The Lord lifted you from the whore house,</i>

01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:14.680
<i>you from flop house, you from drop house...</i>

01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:20.160
- Stop! Stop!
- <i>Out devil!</i>

01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:21.241
Stop!

01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:33.402
No. No. We're just doing dutch.

01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:39.723
- Thanks for calling, man.
- Yeah.

01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:42.291
Look, I betrayed you.

01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:45.650
I know it's not gonna change anything,

01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:47.280
but I wanted to say I'm sorry.

01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:51.570
- I acted stupid, I was...
- Man, hey, we... we good.

01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:54.880
Alright, but all you got to do is just...

01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:56.560
just do right from now on, man.

01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:58.160
Yeah, I know and that's what...

01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:00.960
I tried to change it.
I tried to stop it. But it's...

01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:02.440
it's just right in front of their faces.

01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:05.120
They're turning human beings
into monstrosities

01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:06.440
and nobody gives a fuck.

01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:08.080
Most people that saw you on that screen

01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:10.520
knew calling their congressman
wasn't gonna do shit.

01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:11.760
If you get shown a problem,

01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:13.360
but have no idea how to control it,

01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:15.680
then you just decide to get
used to the problem.

01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:19.651
Yeah, and that's why our plan for tomorrow...

01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:22.640
is important.

01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:23.840
'Cause if we stop them

01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:27.120
from crossing the picket line
this time, we win.

01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:29.960
- That's a good plan.
- Yeah.

01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:32.327
Tomorrow we show 'em how to give fucks.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:38.560
Ain't that about a blip.

01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:41.520
- Happy Halloween
- Look at that shit. You see that shit?

01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:44.640
What the fuck is that about?
What the fuck, man?

01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:46.245
That's what I'm talking about.

01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:54.288
- <i>Get back in there!</i>
- <i>We're hurting! Help us!</i>

01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:03.169
<i>Security code cleared.</i>

01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:11.480
Fuck you, RegalView!

01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:13.920
Fuck you, RegalView! Fuck you, RegalView!

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.320
None of the strikers here
at the RegalView strike

01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:18.240
will tell us why they're all wearing

01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:21.720
their Cola-And A-Smile-Bitch wigs.

01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:23.480
Although the strikers have been

01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:25.680
extremely militant over the past weeks,

01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:28.680
they've not been able to stop
the Stackwater juggernaut

01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:30.520
from breaking through the lines.

01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:33.520
Scabs won't pass! Scabs won't pass!

01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:36.600
Scabs won't pass! Scabs won't pass!

01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:39.760
Scabs won't pass! Scabs won't pass!

01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:41.760
Elbows and assholes, people!

01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:42.841
Let's go!

01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:46.960
Scabs won't pass! Scabs won't pass!...

01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:56.280
Scabs won't pass! Scabs won't pass!

01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:48.248
Hey. Same struggle.

01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:50.521
Same fight.

01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:55.927
Equisapiens! Let's be out!

01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:05.445
Equisapiens, thank you so much!

01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:10.640

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:14.730
Mastermind.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:51.560
Are you serious right now?

01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:53.404
Serious as kicking the can.

01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:54.880
Don't... don't play with me, Cash

01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:56.520
cause that's some serious shit.

01:42:56.600 --> 01:42:59.120
No, man. That's yours.

01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:01.360
And I've got a car that'll do me just fine

01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:03.283
til I get back to work at RegalView.

01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:08.280
Plus, I wanted to say I'm sorry.

01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:10.647
Cash, man. Look.

01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:13.802
Just saying sorry is fine.

01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:18.320
This is good. This is perfect.

01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:19.480
This is the perfect apology.

01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:22.564
I don't want disrespect you.
You know this is cool, I'm...

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:27.001
Hey!

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:35.760

01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:39.000

Well, if the new and glorious

01:43:40.720 --> 01:43:42.880
telemarketers union will have me.

01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:44.644
You got to start fighting somewhere.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:47.760
- Huh?
- Alright, bro.

01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:49.285

- Mm-hmm.

01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:52.124
Kiss already, y'all.

01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:03.486
So, what about being part
of something important, huh?

01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:05.560
Oh, shit.

01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:07.880
It looks like the sun is about to explode.

01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:08.920
Oh, my God...

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:10.001
Come here, sugar.

01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:15.443
We are a part of something important.

01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:17.965
Changing the world.

01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:22.170
Before the sun explodes.

01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:27.960
Well...

01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:30.320

01:44:42.680 --> 01:44:43.920
