WEBVTT

00:01.710 --> 00:02.902
Ah!

00:02.960 --> 00:04.211
Look how handsome I look.

00:04.229 --> 00:05.096
That is a woman's coat.

00:05.297 --> 00:07.382
This coat has clean lines...

00:07.416 --> 00:09.334
and pockets that don't quit.

00:09.368 --> 00:11.002
And it has room for your hips.

00:11.036 --> 00:13.088
And when I wear it, I feel hot to trot.

00:13.139 --> 00:14.705
- You're wearing a dress.
- Yeah, don't say "hot to trot."

00:14.724 --> 00:16.891
My coat makes me say things like that.

00:16.926 --> 00:18.510
First of all, Nick,
it is not your coat.

00:18.544 --> 00:20.512
True, it was delivered
to the wrong address.

00:20.546 --> 00:23.398
But then tell me, why does
it fit like a damn glove?

00:23.432 --> 00:24.632
What is happening to you, man?

00:24.650 --> 00:25.883
I don't know if I can give up

00:25.901 --> 00:28.052
looking this damn good--

00:28.570 --> 00:30.805
It's someone else's woman's coat.

00:30.839 --> 00:31.923
Nothing?

00:31.957 --> 00:34.124
I mean, nothing?
Damn it!

00:34.143 --> 00:35.309
I've been trying to get something going

00:35.344 --> 00:37.311
with myself for a full hour.

00:37.346 --> 00:39.430
It's like a taffy pull
on a hot summer's day.

00:39.464 --> 00:42.483
Eww! You have
the door open, Schmidt.

00:42.518 --> 00:44.986
I'm over myself-- I just
don't do it for me anymore.

00:45.020 --> 00:46.821
I even bought myself
a sexy pair of underpants

00:46.855 --> 00:48.439
to spice things up--
didn't happen.

00:48.473 --> 00:49.607
I just laid there.

00:49.641 --> 00:50.825
You know what? That's it.

00:50.859 --> 00:52.977
Tonight, I start having sex again.

00:52.995 --> 00:55.145
Now, are you two gonna join me?

00:55.664 --> 00:57.281
- Not while I'm here, please.
- Is that the way you wanted to say that?

00:57.315 --> 00:58.649
I'm in, Schmidty!
I am in!

00:58.667 --> 00:59.784
I'm gonna have sex tonight.

00:59.818 --> 01:01.202
Yeah!

01:01.253 --> 01:03.454
Yeah!

I like this feeling, you guys.
I'm liking the vibe

01:14.733 --> 01:16.250
that we got going here.
There's definitely gonna

01:16.285 --> 01:17.835
be some sex-having tonight.

01:17.870 --> 01:19.470
- Oh, yeah...
- Damn it, there needs to be.

01:19.505 --> 01:20.788
You know I haven't had
sex since Labor Day?

01:21.339 --> 01:23.791
I know what the problem is--
I want it too bad.

01:23.825 --> 01:24.825
So, what's your name?

01:27.746 --> 01:31.079
Winst... W-W-W... yeah.

01:31.166 --> 01:32.800
You just need a confidence boost.

01:32.851 --> 01:34.185
Good news--
I'm lousy with the stuff

01:34.219 --> 01:35.686
I got your back tonight.

01:35.721 --> 01:37.889
And you, London Fog, you're
looking hot to trot, baby.

01:37.923 --> 01:39.556
- Any chance you're gonna take that coat off?
- This jacket? No way.

01:39.590 --> 01:40.625
- I'm keeping the jacket on.
- Take the jacket off.

01:40.659 --> 01:41.859
- No, I'm keeping the jacket on.
- No, it's fine.

01:41.894 --> 01:44.395
- Band of brothers.
- Band of brothers, yeah!

01:44.429 --> 01:47.315
The club's up...
Dance, dummy.

01:47.366 --> 01:49.116
Hey, guys.
Guess what?

01:49.151 --> 01:52.036
Sam has the late shift and
Cece's on a date with some Indian guy,

01:52.070 --> 01:54.655
so world's best wing-woman
reporting for duty.

01:54.706 --> 01:56.207
Jess, you can't come.

01:56.241 --> 01:57.408
- What?
- Look,

01:57.442 --> 01:59.627
I actually want to get girls tonight.

01:59.661 --> 02:00.912
You're my cooler.

02:00.946 --> 02:02.163
What?

02:02.197 --> 02:04.031
All I do is help you get laid, Nick.

02:04.066 --> 02:07.399
Maureen, did you have one
very special long-time love?

02:07.619 --> 02:08.719
Yes.

02:08.753 --> 02:10.086
You should be with him.

02:12.291 --> 02:13.424
I'm not your cooler.

02:13.458 --> 02:14.892
It's not you.

02:14.927 --> 02:16.561
It's the way that you behave.

02:16.595 --> 02:17.895
And the things that you say.

02:17.930 --> 02:19.764
And the look on your face.

02:19.798 --> 02:20.681
And...

02:20.716 --> 02:22.066
It <i>is</i> you.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.517
It's just you--
you're the cooler.

02:23.569 --> 02:26.087
I'm sorry, but you can't
come with us tonight.

02:26.121 --> 02:27.488
I get it. Um...

02:27.522 --> 02:29.824
I just... I have, um,
a lot of things I have to do.

02:29.858 --> 02:31.609
More important stuff to do here.

02:31.643 --> 02:33.744
I have to clean out my closet and...

02:33.779 --> 02:35.413
- Oh, yeah. - I have an ice
cream maker to try out.

02:35.447 --> 02:37.182
That's better than going
to a stupid club.

02:37.216 --> 02:39.256
- It's gonna be awesome. It's
gonna be great. - Shut up.

02:43.556 --> 02:46.423
Get out of here, girl,
you're missing nothing.

02:47.560 --> 02:49.143
- It's gonna get so crazy.
- Come on, buddy, get in there.

02:49.195 --> 02:51.629
Get crunk with us, bro.

02:51.664 --> 02:52.881
Yeah-ha-ha!
Yeah!

02:54.149 --> 02:55.400
I can't believe you got us

02:55.434 --> 02:56.618
kicked out of the discotheque, Nick.

02:56.652 --> 02:57.902
- I didn't even do anything.
- Damn it, Nick,

02:57.936 --> 02:59.737
take the coat off, all right?
It freaks girls out.

02:59.771 --> 03:00.738
Well, maybe they're freaked out
'cause you're

03:00.772 --> 03:02.240
not wearing a trench coat.

03:02.274 --> 03:03.408
- Yeah? Have you ever thought of that?
- Okay, guys, please--

03:03.442 --> 03:04.459
no more friendly fire.

03:04.493 --> 03:05.410
- All right.
- Okay.

03:06.444 --> 03:07.495
Ooh, Schmidty type.

03:07.546 --> 03:09.130
That's a Schmidty type right there.

03:11.383 --> 03:13.417
That's me. Yeah, yeah.
Schmidty time...

03:13.451 --> 03:15.720
I feel good. Yeah.
Schmidty time.

03:16.922 --> 03:17.972
- Schmidt! Hey, dude!
- What?!

03:18.006 --> 03:19.056
What about band of brothers?

03:19.091 --> 03:20.174
Your friendship means nothing to me.

03:20.225 --> 03:21.175
Every man for himself.

03:21.226 --> 03:22.643
- Hey, uh...
- Hey.

03:22.677 --> 03:25.229
I was, uh...

03:29.734 --> 03:31.702
Most... M-M...

03:31.736 --> 03:33.871
Okay... Yeah, can you...

03:33.905 --> 03:35.206
- In the beginning...
- Tap out, man. Tap out.

03:35.240 --> 03:37.591
What happened to building
my confidence, Schmidty?

03:37.626 --> 03:38.926
You went in too soon.
Get out of here.

03:38.960 --> 03:39.710
- Go.
- Go.

03:39.744 --> 03:41.962
- Hey.
- What's happening?

03:42.013 --> 03:42.930
Hi.

03:47.006 --> 03:48.602
Wow, that was embarrassing.

03:52.589 --> 03:53.704
Yeah...

03:53.808 --> 03:54.424
Well..

03:55.143 --> 03:56.110
You can relax.

03:56.144 --> 03:57.144
I'm taken.

03:58.814 --> 04:00.765
You were very beautiful
from across the bar.

04:00.783 --> 04:02.266
I'm sorry. I'm Schmidt.

04:02.284 --> 04:05.269
I'm sorry... we were
talking, Schmidt.

04:05.287 --> 04:07.622
What a ten, what a beautiful woman.

04:07.656 --> 04:08.623
He works here.

04:08.657 --> 04:09.624
As a bartender.

04:09.658 --> 04:12.109
Yeah, I do.

04:14.330 --> 04:15.847
<i>February clean-out.</i>

04:20.784 --> 04:22.101
What do you think, Nick?

04:25.724 --> 04:27.558
I'm bored!

04:30.195 --> 04:32.363
No bottoms, no bottoms.

04:32.898 --> 04:34.300
Bottoms on top!

04:35.334 --> 04:38.269
Robot can't find clothes to fit right.

04:38.303 --> 04:40.772
Robot can't find clothes.

04:45.193 --> 04:47.326
I do it for Kenya.

04:50.148 --> 04:51.282
Silver?!

04:52.356 --> 04:54.335
Damn you, Zimbabwe.

04:57.021 --> 04:57.655
Hello?

05:03.327 --> 05:04.529
Hello?

05:12.021 --> 05:13.170
Nice coat you got there.

05:13.188 --> 05:14.171
Well, I just actually wear it 'cause

05:14.189 --> 05:15.172
it gives me confidence.

05:15.190 --> 05:16.307
That's kind of sad.

05:16.341 --> 05:17.025
You know what's really sad

05:17.059 --> 05:18.180
is that he stole the jacket.

05:18.193 --> 05:19.727
It's not technically stealing.

05:19.778 --> 05:21.329
He's still reeling from being dumped.

05:21.363 --> 05:22.697
- Aw.
- He's attached to it.

05:22.731 --> 05:24.148
Like a little bitch "bwanky."

05:24.182 --> 05:25.183
It's not like a blanky, dude.

05:25.201 --> 05:26.517
- It looks like a "bwanky."
- It's not like my "bwanky."

05:26.518 --> 05:30.020
The only reason I'm out tonight is to
make sure he doesn't do anything stupid.

05:30.039 --> 05:31.021
That's not true.
I'm not gonna...

05:31.040 --> 05:32.707
Shut up, Schmidt.

05:32.741 --> 05:34.021
I mean, I could take care of you,

05:34.025 --> 05:35.543
- if you wanted.
- You can what?

05:35.577 --> 05:38.195
I love sad guys and you
seem sadder than most.

05:38.213 --> 05:40.498
I think your plan sounds okay.

05:40.532 --> 05:42.050
When you go home at night,
do you look in the mirror

05:42.084 --> 05:43.364
and just think, "I am the worst"?

05:44.119 --> 05:46.237
- Actually yes, I do.
- Yeah?

05:46.271 --> 05:47.755
- Yeah, a lot of the times.
- You hate yourself?

05:47.806 --> 05:49.006
I definitely don't like myself.

05:49.041 --> 05:50.591
It's right on the line of hate.

05:51.642 --> 05:53.210
What the hell is this?

05:53.228 --> 05:55.212
I don't know how to talk to women.

05:55.730 --> 05:57.381
Reason being, I feel like

05:57.399 --> 05:59.550
you all think that I just
want one thing from you.

05:59.568 --> 06:01.185
- Mm-hmm.
- I want the one thing.

06:01.219 --> 06:02.720
But a bunch of other th... can
a man just want all the things?

06:02.738 --> 06:03.855
I mean, damn.

06:04.389 --> 06:05.773
I like a challenge.

06:05.824 --> 06:08.692
And you are one big challenge.

06:08.726 --> 06:09.743
I'm Daisy.

06:09.778 --> 06:10.894
Winston.

06:10.912 --> 06:13.030
Sam, it's Jess.

06:13.064 --> 06:14.615
Please come get me.

06:14.666 --> 06:17.999
I'm probably fine,
but I also might be dead.

06:18.069 --> 06:19.787
Good-bye.

06:19.838 --> 06:21.205
It's Cece, leave a message.

06:21.239 --> 06:22.773
Cece, it's Jess-- call me back,

06:22.807 --> 06:24.308
I'm alone in the loft.

06:24.342 --> 06:26.143
I think there's something out...

06:27.746 --> 06:29.847
There's something sexy about
a man who just needs me

06:29.848 --> 06:31.265
to make him feel better.

06:31.300 --> 06:33.267
I honestly need you to
make me feel better.

06:33.302 --> 06:34.886
- Nicholas, your phone's ringing.
- Not now, Schmidt!

06:34.920 --> 06:36.637
- Hey, Jess. It's Jess.
- Schmidt, stop.

06:36.688 --> 06:38.422
- You should really talk to her.
- Unbelievable. I am so sad.

06:38.440 --> 06:39.924
Nicholas, you have a phone call.

06:39.942 --> 06:41.425
Don't do this, Schmidt, please don't.

06:41.443 --> 06:43.644
You are the dumbest...

06:43.695 --> 06:44.946
Would you wait one second?

06:44.980 --> 06:46.430
I'm just...
I just have to do this.

06:46.948 --> 06:49.150
- I'll be sad in a second.
- Yep.

06:50.551 --> 06:51.602
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:51.620 --> 06:53.404
- I'm sad.
- Okay.

06:53.438 --> 06:54.722
Uh, what is going on?

06:54.756 --> 06:57.441
There's something at the door
and you have to come home.

06:57.459 --> 06:59.076
Cooler, Jess-- you are being
a cooler right now.

06:59.110 --> 07:01.412
Seriously, I think
it might be gang related.

07:01.446 --> 07:02.413
I've always been worried

07:02.447 --> 07:04.081
about my blue curtains...

07:04.115 --> 07:05.800
Crips.

07:05.834 --> 07:07.969
- The Cri... Jess, I'm done!
- Nick,

07:08.003 --> 07:09.020
I need you.

07:12.123 --> 07:12.974
Yeah, so this is the place.

07:13.008 --> 07:13.975
I'm really glad you're here.

07:14.009 --> 07:15.259
The bedrooms are that way...

07:19.848 --> 07:22.767
What are you doing, pal?

07:22.801 --> 07:23.935
Never leave me alone again.

07:23.969 --> 07:25.336
I'd like to introduce you

07:25.370 --> 07:26.320
to our roommate Jess.

07:26.655 --> 07:28.205
Welcome to our home.

07:29.351 --> 07:31.184
Jess, this loft
has old pipes--

07:31.235 --> 07:32.686
I've told you that a million times,

07:32.737 --> 07:34.304
but you never listen during pipe talk.

07:34.322 --> 07:36.156
Well, pipe talk's boring.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.690
- What is this?
- What is what...?

07:39.827 --> 07:41.277
You drew my face on a melon?

07:41.311 --> 07:42.695
What else was I supposed
to draw your face on?

07:42.746 --> 07:43.830
Nothing. Don't draw my face.

07:43.864 --> 07:45.314
- Okay.
- Jess,

07:45.332 --> 07:47.150
for some reason, that girl out there,

07:47.168 --> 07:48.651
she is sexually

07:48.669 --> 07:51.788
aroused by other people's misery.

07:51.822 --> 07:54.007
Do you understand
the position that puts me in?

07:54.041 --> 07:55.458
It puts you in a really good position?

07:55.492 --> 07:57.844
It really does.
And then what happens?

07:57.878 --> 07:59.963
Okay, I understand how,
in this instance,

07:59.997 --> 08:01.631
I might have cooled things off for you.

08:01.665 --> 08:04.517
- Thank you for admitting that.
- I am prepared to fix it.

08:04.552 --> 08:07.720
'Cause, son, I'm gonna get you laid.

08:07.771 --> 08:09.855
Okay, it's not how it is and
never call me "son"

08:09.890 --> 08:10.973
and don't talk like that.

08:11.807 --> 08:12.809
The game is <i>True American</i>

08:12.843 --> 08:15.444
Clinton rules.

08:15.445 --> 08:16.062
Pick your interns.

08:16.113 --> 08:18.981
- I don't understand the game.
- Uh, you're gonna be my intern.

08:19.015 --> 08:19.666
It's okay, it's stripping.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.683
It's not just stripping, it's sexy.

08:21.701 --> 08:22.285
Okay, so what exactly are the rules?

08:22.319 --> 08:25.021
- The floor is lava, doves versus hawks.
- The couch is the Mason-Dixon line.

08:25.039 --> 08:26.039
We're not doing
cabinets-- no cabinets.

08:26.073 --> 08:27.407
- No cabinet.
- No cabinets.

08:27.458 --> 08:28.992
One, two, three, four, JFK!

08:29.026 --> 08:30.243
FDR!

08:30.294 --> 08:31.578
Go, go--
that's the lava!

08:33.363 --> 08:35.164
- Down, down in the tunnel.
- No.

08:35.198 --> 08:36.716
I'm the President,
you're the Vice President.

08:36.750 --> 08:37.217
Joe Biden!

08:37.251 --> 08:38.751
- It's Abu Nazir!
- Where?

08:38.802 --> 08:41.754
- No, no, no, no! Spin, spin, spin, spin!
- Fly! Do the chicken dance!

08:41.804 --> 08:44.090
- No, no counter clock-wise?
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

08:44.140 --> 08:46.091
Holly, you're in the
Amber Waves of Grain.

08:46.442 --> 08:47.677
You have to lose your jacket.

08:47.711 --> 08:49.062
- I...
- Take off your jacket; She's right.

08:49.096 --> 08:50.897
Those are the rules.

08:50.931 --> 08:52.381
Is there, like, a printout of
the rules I can see, or...?

08:52.399 --> 08:53.566
- No!
- No!

08:53.601 --> 08:54.601
I thought this was like music...

08:54.652 --> 08:56.019
Howard Dean Scream.

08:56.053 --> 08:58.354
Yeah!

08:59.138 --> 09:00.240
God...

09:00.774 --> 09:02.775
I am sorry I was crying so much.

09:02.859 --> 09:04.944
God, that film,
it just... it just reminded me

09:04.995 --> 09:06.663
how much I want to have kids, you know?

09:08.898 --> 09:10.200
Was that just a really weird thing

09:10.234 --> 09:12.401
- to say on a first date?
- No.

09:12.419 --> 09:14.120
Are you sure?
It felt a bit weird.

09:14.671 --> 09:18.004
Oh, my best friend has
texted me, like, 12 times.

09:18.742 --> 09:20.876
I get it-- you're just trying
to get out of the date.

09:20.910 --> 09:22.928
- No, no, no-- no, this is real.
- It's the kids thing. I knew it.

09:22.963 --> 09:25.047
Some psycho keeps scratching at
her door and then running away.

09:25.081 --> 09:28.050
She's pretty sure it's
the Calabasas Scratcher.

09:28.084 --> 09:29.301
- I mean, is that a thing?
- What?

09:29.352 --> 09:30.553
I don't keep up with local news.

09:30.587 --> 09:31.887
I don't know, it's fine.

09:31.921 --> 09:33.222
You don't have to lie to me.

09:33.256 --> 09:34.590
- I get it.
- You can come with me.

09:34.608 --> 09:35.891
Okay? Then you'll see.

09:35.925 --> 09:37.426
- Well, all right.
- She's just like this.

09:37.444 --> 09:38.978
<i>Schmidt, Schmidt, Schmidt!</i>

09:39.029 --> 09:41.430
- Schmidt, Schmidt, Schmidt!
- Gettysburg, Bull Run.

09:41.448 --> 09:44.116
Oh, no, oh, no,
I think I fell-- oh, no.

09:44.151 --> 09:45.985
In the course of human events,
you must...

09:46.036 --> 09:47.620
Surrender your shirt!

09:47.654 --> 09:49.071
Fine, I'll take off my shirt.

09:49.105 --> 09:50.906
He did it on purpose--
he did it to impress her!

09:50.940 --> 09:52.291
- U.S.A.
- I am not...

09:52.325 --> 09:53.292
I am not a crook!

09:53.326 --> 09:56.111
- I am not a crook!
- What do you mean, man?

09:56.129 --> 09:58.297
I took my shirt off! Wait!
It's part of the game, you guys!

09:58.331 --> 10:01.000
Up, up, up.
I'm up! Oh, wow!

10:01.051 --> 10:03.252
This footstool really
reminds me of my ex.

10:03.286 --> 10:06.255
Liar! Holly, Holly, look at
these-- these are my abs.

10:06.289 --> 10:08.457
Hard to believe that I used to
be a great big fat person.

10:08.475 --> 10:09.675
Oh, fat makes me so sad.

10:09.726 --> 10:10.843
Yeah, it makes me sad, too.

10:10.894 --> 10:12.428
I'm chubby... I'm a fat guy.

10:12.462 --> 10:14.146
- You look great, man.
- I'm a fat boy.

10:14.181 --> 10:15.648
- Feel where the fat used to be?
- Yeah.

10:15.682 --> 10:16.932
Yeah, it's been replaced
with phantom fat.

10:16.966 --> 10:18.768
I still feel it jiggle.

10:18.802 --> 10:20.486
Hey, Schmidt, your butt

10:20.520 --> 10:22.488
just violated
the Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act1

10:22.522 --> 10:24.490
Westward Ho, son!
Westward Ho.

10:24.524 --> 10:26.659
- Bye-bye, Schmidt.
- Damn it.

10:26.693 --> 10:27.976
Come on, all you got
to do is talk to her,

10:27.994 --> 10:29.361
what's the big deal?

10:29.412 --> 10:31.113
Okay, mm...

10:31.147 --> 10:33.182
You're at the bar-- I'm Holly.

10:33.216 --> 10:35.484
Boy, am I thirsty.

10:35.519 --> 10:37.102
I was wondering if, like...

10:37.154 --> 10:38.821
if you want... if you want,
per chance, like...

10:38.855 --> 10:39.855
"Per chance," really?

10:39.889 --> 10:41.941
Hm? No, it's, uh...

10:41.992 --> 10:44.076
- You're a swell kind of gal.
- Getting worse.

10:44.110 --> 10:45.194
You come on out to the bar.

10:46.496 --> 10:48.497
Hey, girl, what your name is?

10:48.532 --> 10:50.115
- Oh, my God.
- What that thing do?

10:50.167 --> 10:51.333
Oh, my God.

10:51.368 --> 10:52.918
- Out of all the gals in this...
- God... what...

10:52.953 --> 10:55.754
- you walked into mine.
- Please.

10:55.789 --> 10:58.007
- Um...
- Yeah, take a sip.

10:58.041 --> 10:59.402
Okay, look, I think you're amazing.

10:59.409 --> 11:01.260
Would you like to have a drink with me?

11:01.294 --> 11:03.696
Yes, yes, I will.

11:03.730 --> 11:04.697
Now give me that.

11:06.182 --> 11:07.683
This coat is an unfair
advantage-- take it off.

11:07.701 --> 11:08.567
I love the coat.

11:08.618 --> 11:09.685
Take the coat off!

11:09.703 --> 11:10.402
Hey, Schmidt!

11:10.453 --> 11:12.855
Hey, hey! No!

11:12.873 --> 11:14.023
Order! Order!

11:14.041 --> 11:16.159
All right, there's only
one way to solve this.

11:16.193 --> 11:18.527
Two of us have to go
behind the Iron Curtain,

11:18.545 --> 11:20.213
which is that door there, and kiss.

11:20.247 --> 11:22.681
And there has to be a "clear

11:22.832 --> 11:25.767
- and present threat of tongue."
- This is why I voted for you.

11:25.785 --> 11:27.252
- Holly, you ready for this?
- Definitely against the president's order.

11:27.421 --> 11:28.554
- Ready?
- Let's do the count.

11:28.588 --> 11:29.805
The two, three or four.

11:29.840 --> 11:30.921
So when we do this, do two.

11:30.924 --> 11:31.841
Okay. Not three, not
one, not four-- two.

11:31.875 --> 11:33.058
A one or a three.
Anything but a two.

11:33.093 --> 11:35.177
Just not a two. Two. Do you hear me?
Two. Not four.

11:35.211 --> 11:36.679
One, two, three.

11:36.713 --> 11:39.014
What are you doing?
You said not to do a two!

11:39.048 --> 11:40.883
I made it so clear!

11:43.052 --> 11:45.070
- No...!
- No...!

11:45.105 --> 11:46.605
- ...brought the change in!
- Mulligan! Mulligan!

11:46.656 --> 11:48.858
Holly, wait for me!
I'm very sad!

11:48.892 --> 11:50.242
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

11:50.277 --> 11:52.862
Open the door!
Open the door!

11:52.896 --> 11:55.114
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

11:57.918 --> 11:59.635
I can see how in this second instance

11:59.669 --> 12:00.953
I might be considered a cooler...

12:01.004 --> 12:02.254
if you want to label me.

12:02.589 --> 12:03.839
You think?

12:04.615 --> 12:08.799
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

12:08.834 --> 12:12.167
Okay, we kissed. Let us out.
Sent you a picture.

12:13.988 --> 12:15.023
That ain't no kiss, man!

12:15.074 --> 12:16.341
Come on, Inspector Gadget,

12:16.392 --> 12:17.942
inspect those tonsils.

12:17.977 --> 12:20.061
Just give Jess a tender, sensual kiss,

12:20.579 --> 12:21.896
and we will let you right out.

12:21.914 --> 12:23.698
- Shut up, Schmidt!
- Schmidt, stay out of this!

12:23.732 --> 12:25.093
Please stop yelling at me!

12:25.117 --> 12:26.117
You know that I'm ten percent

12:26.168 --> 12:27.369
more emotionally fragile
than Nick right now.

12:27.403 --> 12:28.753
No, no, don't!
No, please!

12:28.788 --> 12:29.621
Don't! Don't!

12:30.672 --> 12:31.906
Do you mind if I tell you a story?

12:31.924 --> 12:33.758
- Is it sad?
- Holly, he's really happy!

12:33.793 --> 12:35.743
He's got a 401K
and a six-pack!

12:35.761 --> 12:37.545
Well, it's the tale

12:37.579 --> 12:39.247
of an uber successful
marketing executive's journey...

12:39.265 --> 12:41.383
- I'm hairy and chubby!
- ...into heartbreak.

12:41.417 --> 12:42.050
Mm-hmm.

12:42.084 --> 12:43.385
Her name was Cecelia.

12:43.419 --> 12:45.603
No!

12:45.638 --> 12:47.105
Come on, come on. Holly, wait!

12:47.139 --> 12:49.657
Ugh! What is the big deal?

12:50.192 --> 12:52.227
Let's just suck it up
and French a little.

12:52.261 --> 12:53.445
Okay, fine, but don't say

12:53.479 --> 12:55.063
"Let's suck it up
and French a little."

12:55.097 --> 12:56.448
Okay, fine. Let's do this.

12:57.983 --> 12:59.267
What were you doing?!

12:59.285 --> 13:01.403
Well, I thought you're
sitting on the ground.

13:01.437 --> 13:02.737
- No. I... Okay.
- Uh!

13:02.771 --> 13:04.739
Okay, Jess, hey,
this is not a big deal.

13:04.773 --> 13:06.607
Okay, not a big deal.
Let's just do it.

13:06.625 --> 13:08.326
- Fine. Let's just do it.
- Okay. Great, yeah.

13:08.377 --> 13:09.444
Let's just do it.

13:09.462 --> 13:10.495
Okay, cool.

13:10.546 --> 13:11.946
Why are you licking your lips?

13:11.964 --> 13:14.449
- Should I not? Do you
want dry lips? - No.

13:14.467 --> 13:15.950
Then I'm just licking 'em
to make 'em better.

13:15.968 --> 13:17.118
- Okay.
- Fine.

13:17.136 --> 13:19.170
- Do it.
- I'm doing it.

13:19.221 --> 13:20.505
Fine, then do it.

13:21.056 --> 13:21.973
Are you a tongue-er?

13:22.007 --> 13:23.841
- Am I a tongue-er?
- I don't want to put

13:23.892 --> 13:25.126
my tongue in your mouth,
if you don't like it.

13:25.144 --> 13:26.177
Just kiss me!

13:26.228 --> 13:27.679
Okay, all right, great.

13:27.730 --> 13:29.764
- That's what I'm gonna do.
- All right.

13:30.298 --> 13:30.815
Ready?

13:30.850 --> 13:32.183
Yeah.

13:32.234 --> 13:34.185
One, two... I'm actually
not gonna do a count.

13:34.236 --> 13:35.854
- Okay.
- That's not my style when I kiss.

13:35.905 --> 13:37.105
- I don't count down before...
- Okay.

13:37.139 --> 13:39.524
- I don't think so.
- Okay.

13:39.958 --> 13:41.475
- Ready?
- Yep.

13:42.528 --> 13:44.946
- I'm sorry. You can't do that.
- What did I do?

13:44.980 --> 13:46.497
- Your face.
- My face?

13:46.531 --> 13:48.199
Yeah, you can't do that with your face.

13:48.250 --> 13:49.451
Okay, I'll do something
different with my face.

13:49.485 --> 13:51.486
Okay, all right, great.

13:53.038 --> 13:54.472
Wait-- you can't kiss
with your teeth!

13:54.507 --> 13:56.040
Okay, I can't--
no, I can't do this.

13:56.091 --> 13:58.209
Well, you can't try to kiss me
like a Joker and expect...

13:58.260 --> 13:59.844
Okay, you're...
let me out of here!

13:59.879 --> 14:02.130
Let me out! Sometimes, I
hear her name when the wind blows.

14:02.164 --> 14:03.114
Please!

14:03.149 --> 14:05.383
Open the door!
Cece.

14:05.434 --> 14:08.520
You know, I left something
behind in the desert that day:

14:08.554 --> 14:10.188
My faith and true love...

14:10.222 --> 14:12.857
and my future biracial child.

14:12.892 --> 14:14.726
You, you kind of lost me there.

14:14.777 --> 14:16.144
Not really doing it for me.

14:16.178 --> 14:17.695
It's more depressing than sad.

14:17.730 --> 14:18.947
- It's not depress...
- It's depressing.

14:18.981 --> 14:19.948
- It's sort of depressing.
- No, no, no, it's not depressing.

14:19.982 --> 14:20.949
It's not really doing it for me.

14:20.983 --> 14:21.900
I'm gonna tell you
why it's not depressing.

14:21.951 --> 14:23.151
Because she is still in love with me.

14:23.185 --> 14:26.488
I'm over it completely.

14:26.522 --> 14:29.574
Having said that,
it's so hard to move on.

14:29.625 --> 14:31.159
- Do-do you know what I mean?
- Yes.

14:31.193 --> 14:32.644
- Can you help me move on, Holly?
- You need help moving.

14:32.678 --> 14:34.379
- Can you heal my pain?
- I can heal your pain.

14:34.413 --> 14:35.497
- Can you ple...
- I can heal you.

14:35.531 --> 14:36.697
Yeah, you can heal my...

14:36.715 --> 14:38.249
Hey, Jess? Where's Jess? Jess,

14:38.300 --> 14:40.168
where are you?
I came as fast as I can.

14:40.202 --> 14:42.670
- Cece, open the door!
- Cece, don't worry! I'm just trapped

14:42.704 --> 14:43.922
- I need to kill Schmidt!
- Until I kiss Nick!

14:43.973 --> 14:46.391
- What?
- You're the... She's <i>the</i> Cece?

14:46.425 --> 14:47.842
Right there, in the flesh.

14:47.876 --> 14:49.210
You are obsessed!

14:49.995 --> 14:51.679
Cece, honey, you have to move on, okay?

14:51.714 --> 14:53.848
You can't love somebody forever.

14:53.882 --> 14:56.434
I'm sorry.
You love that small shiny man?

14:56.485 --> 14:57.885
- No!
- What do you mean, small, man?

14:57.903 --> 14:59.404
None of this is true.

14:59.438 --> 15:02.056
No, because I'm on a date.

15:02.074 --> 15:03.942
Should we make out to make him
jealous or something?

15:04.493 --> 15:06.277
Are you lying to me?
I really hate being lied to.

15:06.328 --> 15:09.030
I would never lie to you.
I haven't lied to you

15:09.064 --> 15:11.749
this whole time we've been
in this loft-- that's a fact.

15:11.784 --> 15:13.535
- Cece, uh...
- Hey.

15:13.569 --> 15:16.254
...please tell me,
in front of Holly,

15:16.288 --> 15:17.539
how much you still love me.

15:17.573 --> 15:19.624
I'm sorry.
Is this why we came here?

15:19.675 --> 15:21.960
- Please, I don't really know
what that accent is. - English.

15:22.011 --> 15:23.962
I speak English. That
didn't sound like English.

15:24.013 --> 15:26.931
It will be my final request,

15:26.966 --> 15:28.716
I promise,

15:28.750 --> 15:31.102
so both of us can move on.

15:31.636 --> 15:35.269
- 'Cause I, you know, I'd really
like to move on. - I get it.

15:35.357 --> 15:38.476
- I'd like to move on all night long with Holly.
- Okay, I get it.

15:41.530 --> 15:44.265
I'm only gonna say this one more time.

15:44.283 --> 15:47.616
I always have and always will...

15:48.320 --> 15:50.622
love you.

15:52.656 --> 15:54.626
All right, all right, you know,
this is the most elaborate way

15:54.627 --> 15:57.161
to get out of dating me that
I've ever experienced, so...

16:00.983 --> 16:01.983
Winny, it's Nicky.

16:02.017 --> 16:03.585
Open the door, man!

16:03.619 --> 16:05.637
- I guess the game's over.
- I thought we were working together.

16:05.671 --> 16:06.921
I was gonna start on your confidence

16:06.955 --> 16:08.356
and work my way up to your facial hair.

16:08.390 --> 16:09.841
What's your fiancé
gonna say about that?

16:09.892 --> 16:12.627
Oh, this? I just wear it
so guys don't hit on me in bars.

16:12.645 --> 16:13.645
Okay.

16:13.679 --> 16:14.962
I'm single.

16:14.980 --> 16:16.481
What are you gonna do about it, huh?

16:16.515 --> 16:17.849
I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do.

16:17.900 --> 16:18.766
Okay, I'm waiting.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.968
- Um, so...
- Still waiting.

16:20.986 --> 16:22.704
Don't say anything!

16:22.738 --> 16:23.688
She sounds weird!
Just let us out!

16:23.739 --> 16:25.857
- Just open the door.
- Yeah.

16:32.697 --> 16:34.999
C minus.
You kiss like a damn bitch.

16:35.534 --> 16:37.335
- Oh, you're messing with me; Okay.
- Little bit.

16:39.538 --> 16:41.623
Nick, I'm gonna admit it.

16:41.657 --> 16:42.840
I might be your cooler.

16:42.875 --> 16:44.626
I chalk it up to bad timing.

16:44.660 --> 16:45.960
Well, thank you for admitting that.

16:45.994 --> 16:48.129
But to be fair,

16:48.163 --> 16:50.381
you are your own cooler
70% of the time.

16:50.432 --> 16:52.967
Some basic grooming, Nick,
and you'd be smoking hot.

16:53.001 --> 16:54.669
I'd be smoking hot?

16:54.687 --> 16:55.853
You'd be smoking hot.

16:55.888 --> 16:56.888
You do want to kiss me, then.

16:56.939 --> 16:58.690
All bets are off if you take a shower.

16:58.724 --> 17:01.275
That is very nice of you.

17:09.902 --> 17:11.202
Jess, are you okay?
I got your message!

17:11.236 --> 17:13.154
What's happening?

17:13.188 --> 17:15.373
- Sam, I'm so sorry. Yeah... here,
- I'll help you up. I'll help you up.

17:15.406 --> 17:15.990
It was a false alarm.

17:16.023 --> 17:17.492
All right.

17:17.526 --> 17:19.743
What are you doing back there?

17:19.795 --> 17:22.914
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

17:24.365 --> 17:26.049
Okay, let's just do this already.

17:26.084 --> 17:27.535
- Just kiss me.
- No, I'm not gonna kiss you.

17:27.553 --> 17:28.720
- Kiss me!
- Jess, stop!

17:28.754 --> 17:30.588
God! Miller,
just kiss me already!

17:30.639 --> 17:33.040
No, not like this!

17:34.058 --> 17:35.259
That, that...

17:35.310 --> 17:37.244
- What? What does that mean?
- No, I didn't...

17:37.312 --> 17:39.596
Nothing. I just, I didn't
mean it like that.

17:39.630 --> 17:41.848
I just, we can't like that because

17:41.899 --> 17:44.101
that's not....
Do you know, like...?

17:44.135 --> 17:46.103
It's very, like, you don't...

17:46.137 --> 17:47.604
That's not what it...

17:47.638 --> 17:48.772
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

17:48.806 --> 17:50.807
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

17:50.825 --> 17:52.660
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

17:52.944 --> 17:54.528
If you'll excuse me.

17:54.529 --> 17:55.997
Nick, what are you doing?

17:57.031 --> 17:58.148
What are you do...?

17:58.166 --> 17:59.617
- I'm fine.
- Nick!

17:59.651 --> 18:02.870
I just have to move this,
right here-- my back. Aah!

18:02.921 --> 18:05.122
Okay, this makes sense.

18:05.156 --> 18:06.290
What are you doing?!

18:06.324 --> 18:08.125
I just need a little air...

18:08.159 --> 18:09.377
What are you doing?!

18:09.428 --> 18:12.296
This is what I needed.
This is... Ah-ha-ha!

18:12.330 --> 18:13.881
Nick, you don't have to kiss me!

18:13.932 --> 18:15.666
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

18:15.684 --> 18:17.718
Help! Help me!

18:18.887 --> 18:20.521
I made a very bad mistake!

18:20.555 --> 18:22.339
Nick, no! No!

18:22.357 --> 18:23.207
Help me open this window!
Help!

18:23.241 --> 18:24.341
Don't jump!

18:24.359 --> 18:26.193
Hold it right there!

18:27.955 --> 18:30.673
You scared me half to death out there.

18:30.857 --> 18:32.190
Are you not getting enough attention?

18:32.208 --> 18:33.959
I'm fine! I am fine!

18:33.993 --> 18:35.077
You wouldn't let me out.

18:35.128 --> 18:37.162
- I was partly joking!
- Nick, we will talk

18:37.196 --> 18:38.463
about this in the morning.

18:38.498 --> 18:40.082
Yes, we will.
But first...

18:40.133 --> 18:42.251
I'm gonna go do stuff with a girl.

18:42.302 --> 18:43.869
Yeah!

18:43.887 --> 18:45.203
- I'm sorry.
- I'm glad you're okay.

18:45.221 --> 18:46.472
I'm fine.
I'm just, I got...

18:46.506 --> 18:47.756
Hey, Nick, if you ever feel the urge

18:47.807 --> 18:48.974
to jump again, you call me.

18:49.009 --> 18:50.342
Thank you.

18:50.876 --> 18:54.045
I am genuinely afraid of her.

18:54.063 --> 18:55.698
I wish you didn't do that.

18:55.732 --> 18:57.466
Close the door.

18:58.134 --> 18:59.717
Thank you.

19:01.655 --> 19:04.490
That was freakin' hilarious!

19:04.524 --> 19:06.992
I mean, Jess, he jumped out on
a ledge instead of kissing you.

19:07.027 --> 19:08.027
Can you believe that?

19:08.061 --> 19:09.495
I'm an idiot.

19:09.529 --> 19:11.897
Well, he's missing out.

19:11.915 --> 19:13.449
- You want to go to bed?
- Mm-hmm.

19:13.500 --> 19:14.500
Okay.

Nick!

19:30.934 --> 19:33.018
The scratching's back.

19:33.053 --> 19:34.470
All right, all right.

19:34.521 --> 19:35.554
Jess, I'll take care of it.

19:35.588 --> 19:36.605
Relax.

19:38.608 --> 19:39.692
There's nobody there.

19:41.094 --> 19:43.195
Admiral! Brian!

19:43.229 --> 19:45.597
Admiral Hornbeck!
Brian, down!

19:45.615 --> 19:47.566
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

19:47.600 --> 19:49.434
Sometimes he gets out...
Is that my coat?

19:49.452 --> 19:50.653
What...?

19:50.704 --> 19:52.604
I thought my package
was delivered here.

19:52.622 --> 19:54.156
- It's her coat.
- I was knocking and knocking.

19:54.207 --> 19:55.708
Are you sleeping in it?!

19:55.742 --> 19:57.042
- I think he might have been.
- Why?!

19:57.077 --> 19:58.377
'Cause it's a fantastic coat.

19:58.411 --> 19:59.244
It gives me confidence.

19:59.278 --> 20:00.612
Man, that is a woman's coat.

20:00.630 --> 20:01.947
- What are you doing?
- All right, well, this is not the...

20:01.965 --> 20:03.415
Give her the coat, Nick.

20:03.449 --> 20:05.084
I love this coat.

20:05.118 --> 20:07.452
So much weird crap
happens in this apartment.

20:07.470 --> 20:08.554
He's really sorry.

20:11.574 --> 20:12.841
God!

20:14.477 --> 20:16.845
Well, I guess
the old Nick is back, huh?

20:16.896 --> 20:18.731
Yeah. I'm gonna miss
Trench Coat Nick.

20:19.766 --> 20:20.849
He was pretty great.

20:20.900 --> 20:21.850
I might miss him.

20:21.901 --> 20:23.569
I liked him.

20:23.603 --> 20:24.970
He had guts.

20:24.988 --> 20:26.188
It was a woman's coat.

20:27.640 --> 20:29.575
- Good night, Nick.
- Good night.

20:49.178 --> 20:50.863
I meant something like that.

21:08.031 --> 21:09.782
Oh, uh, hey, babe,

21:10.316 --> 21:12.382
do you mind if I, uh,
put this somewhere else?

21:12.450 --> 21:14.551
It's kind of, it's kind
of creeping me out

21:14.619 --> 21:16.921
when I'm trying to go to sleep.

21:16.988 --> 21:18.189
Yeah, that's fine.

21:18.256 --> 21:19.356
- Cool.
- That's fine.

21:22.292 --> 21:23.393
Whew.
