WEBVTT

00:03.795 --> 00:05.786
Easy, easy.

00:05.797 --> 00:07.298
Just m...

00:09.259 --> 00:11.671
Where's your gun?

00:11.720 --> 00:14.757
It's on my right hip,

00:14.806 --> 00:16.762
under my jacket.

00:25.734 --> 00:27.144
And your phone?

00:27.194 --> 00:28.525
Your radio?

00:28.570 --> 00:30.731
I don't have a radio.

00:30.781 --> 00:34.114
My phone is in
my other jacket pocket.

00:54.846 --> 00:57.007
Put on your seatbelt.

01:14.741 --> 01:17.232
Let's go.

01:17.286 --> 01:20.619
Where do you want to go?

01:20.664 --> 01:22.871
Away from the lights.

02:05.709 --> 02:08.621
Your car at the station--
you wanted us to find it?

02:08.629 --> 02:12.121
You think I wanted this?

02:12.174 --> 02:14.836
You could have gotten
on a train.

02:14.885 --> 02:16.750
And go where?

02:16.803 --> 02:18.464
Tell me.

02:18.513 --> 02:22.176
Everything I had is here,
and now it's gone.

02:22.267 --> 02:23.973
I didn't plan anything.
I...

02:24.019 --> 02:26.351
Things happen.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.352
Things can get
really out of control.

02:28.398 --> 02:30.059
But I can help you.

02:30.067 --> 02:34.527
Did you want to help me when
I was minding my own business?

02:34.571 --> 02:37.187
No.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.105
You show up on my doorstep,

02:39.159 --> 02:41.525
and you stick that badge
in my face,

02:41.578 --> 02:44.866
and you have the audacity
to question my intentions.

02:44.915 --> 02:46.621
You treat me like
I'm some kind of a pervert.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.999
Why?
Because I help kids.

02:49.044 --> 02:51.581
I do what no one else
wants to do.

02:51.630 --> 02:53.837
Deigns to do.

02:53.882 --> 02:57.090
And I end up with a target
on my back for it.

03:02.933 --> 03:06.892
These kids are in so much pain.

03:06.937 --> 03:09.303
If only you could see
what's going on inside them.

03:09.356 --> 03:11.312
You have no idea.

03:13.402 --> 03:15.267
But I see them.

03:25.956 --> 03:27.366
Don't move.

03:27.416 --> 03:28.906
Okay, you don't need
to point the gun at me.

03:28.959 --> 03:31.245
Shut up.

03:35.841 --> 03:37.832
Go. Go!

03:53.024 --> 03:54.980
All units report
to King Street station.

03:54.985 --> 03:56.771
Watch it, dick.

03:56.820 --> 03:58.401
Pick up your damn phone,
all right?

03:58.447 --> 04:00.153
- Skinner's got every uni in the
city en route. - Hey. What the hell?

04:00.157 --> 04:02.148
I've been calling you all night.
You don't answer your calls?

04:02.284 --> 04:04.149
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm a bit caught up right now.

04:04.202 --> 04:06.864
Look, between the 12 trains
that already left the station,

04:06.872 --> 04:09.363
- we got to eyeball about 1,600 people.
- Lyric is gone!

04:09.416 --> 04:10.622
Bullet, what are you
talking about?

04:10.667 --> 04:11.702
Pastor Mike took her!

04:11.752 --> 04:12.707
What?

04:12.753 --> 04:14.618
He made Lyric go to his house.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.787
He wouldn't let her
stay at Beacon.

04:16.840 --> 04:18.831
- When?
- Tonight.

04:18.884 --> 04:19.873
She called me all scared,

04:19.926 --> 04:21.336
saying he was trying
to kill her.

04:21.386 --> 04:23.763
Where'd they go?

04:23.805 --> 04:25.261
Think, Bullet.

04:25.307 --> 04:28.299
She say where they were going?

04:28.351 --> 04:29.807
The woods.

04:29.853 --> 04:30.842
She said he's taking her

04:30.896 --> 04:32.432
to where he killed
all the other girls.

04:37.027 --> 04:40.770
The woods we found
the bodies in?

04:40.822 --> 04:42.437
When'd your CI get this?

04:42.491 --> 04:44.027
Around 8:00.
It's when she said she called,

04:44.075 --> 04:45.611
right before we hit the house.

04:45.660 --> 04:47.912
So his car at the train station
is some kind of decoy?

04:47.913 --> 04:49.699
Could be.

04:49.748 --> 04:51.033
Is the Pastor that smart?

04:51.082 --> 04:52.913
I mean, that's some
"Spy Vs. Spy" shit.

04:52.959 --> 04:55.496
Well, he'd have to be some kind of
idiot to go back to those woods.

04:55.545 --> 04:56.796
It's what she said, Loo.

04:56.838 --> 04:58.669
We're already spread thin
searching those trains.

04:58.715 --> 05:00.455
Now you want a full search
of a four-mile park.

05:00.509 --> 05:03.216
Yeah.

05:07.641 --> 05:08.630
You trust this CI?

05:08.683 --> 05:10.639
No doubt, sir.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.846
- Pull half our guys, get them to the park.
- Okay.

05:15.899 --> 05:18.015
I'll call in Air Support.
Where's Linden?

05:18.068 --> 05:19.023
I don't know.

05:19.069 --> 05:20.684
Well, get her in!

05:20.737 --> 05:22.523
We need all hands on deck.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.034
If we're gonna drive around
all night,

05:30.080 --> 05:31.616
do you mind if
I have a cigarette?

05:31.623 --> 05:32.738
Yes, I do.

05:32.791 --> 05:34.907
Your car already smells
like an ashtray.

05:41.091 --> 05:43.798
I do understand your work.
I grew up in foster care.

05:44.928 --> 05:47.089
Bounced around different homes,
different schools,

05:47.264 --> 05:48.595
even ran away a few times.

05:48.640 --> 05:53.259
You want to know
what the worst part was?

05:53.270 --> 05:55.511
Pity.

05:55.564 --> 05:58.476
People paint a picture
of you in their heads,

05:58.525 --> 06:02.359
and they don't see you,
who you really are.

06:04.406 --> 06:07.614
That's what they taught you,
I suppose.

06:09.119 --> 06:13.283
Humanize yourself
so the abductor won't kill you.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.582
It won't work.

06:24.634 --> 06:27.011
We 're gonna do
another sweep

06:27.053 --> 06:28.793
of the north perimeter
of the park.

06:28.847 --> 06:31.589
We still got nothing.
Over.

06:31.641 --> 06:34.974
There's a fork in the
road past Lexington, Pastor.

06:35.020 --> 06:37.352
Stay left.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.438
Is the park
fully contained yet?

06:40.483 --> 06:43.520
Copy. Canine units aren’t
picking anything up. Over.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.435
We lose the choppers in 20.

06:45.488 --> 06:47.774
Hansen, you're losing
your eye in the sky.

06:47.782 --> 06:48.908
You gotta move.

06:48.950 --> 06:50.781
We 're gonna push
towards the marshes,

06:50.827 --> 06:53.034
but we got nothing
in the park so far. Over.

06:53.079 --> 06:54.159
Keep looking.

06:54.164 --> 06:55.825
Someone’s sitting
on the channel.

06:55.874 --> 06:57.785
Radio 15035.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.449
Task force-- that's you.

06:59.461 --> 07:01.827
My CI swore
they were in the woods.

07:01.880 --> 07:04.713
Could have come and gone
by now.

07:04.758 --> 07:08.046
Someone’s mike’s open.
Camping on the channel.

07:08.094 --> 07:11.427
Repeat-- we got an open mike
from radio 15035.

07:11.473 --> 07:13.714
O35?

07:13.725 --> 07:15.215
That's Linden's radio.

07:16.561 --> 07:17.971
I know you’re angry,

07:18.021 --> 07:20.933
but you need to think
about your options.

07:20.982 --> 07:22.222
Everyone shut up!

07:22.275 --> 07:25.017
Like what?

07:25.070 --> 07:27.311
Shut up!!

07:27.322 --> 07:30.655
Beacon is gone.

07:30.659 --> 07:33.901
Everything I built is gone.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.490
Linden's with the Pastor.

07:35.538 --> 07:36.573
When'd you last see her?

07:36.623 --> 07:38.864
With you, at the train station.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.866
You have choices right now.

07:40.919 --> 07:43.251
But if my guys find out
you’re pointing a gun at me,

07:43.254 --> 07:45.245
I can’t help you...

07:45.507 --> 07:47.714
Dispatch to 15035.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.378
Dispatch to 15035.

07:49.386 --> 07:51.377
All units,
this is Lieutenant Skinner.

07:51.429 --> 07:54.171
An officer's making an emergency
broadcast on channel 7.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.636
All units, switch to L-TAC
until further notice.

07:56.685 --> 08:00.473
IfI don 't report in and we
keep driving around the city,

08:00.522 --> 08:02.353
someone is bound to notice.

08:02.399 --> 08:04.310
They're in the city.
Call off all searches-- now!

08:04.359 --> 08:05.895
Put out a BOLO
on Linden's vehicle.

08:05.944 --> 08:07.059
Seattle all, King County all.

08:07.112 --> 08:08.397
Phone--
what about her phone?

08:08.446 --> 08:10.027
Her phone is off, sir.

08:10.031 --> 08:11.362
I've been trying it nonstop
since you told me to.

08:23.420 --> 08:27.914
Have you ever seen
what heroin does to a kid?

08:27.966 --> 08:30.673
What withdrawal is like?

08:30.719 --> 08:33.552
When I worked the jails, yeah.

08:35.181 --> 08:37.513
She was a junkie.

08:37.559 --> 08:40.301
Ajunkie whore.

08:40.311 --> 08:45.146
That's all they are
to this world.

08:45.150 --> 08:48.563
Human garbage, these kids.

08:48.611 --> 08:49.896
No one cares.

08:49.946 --> 08:52.688
No one goes looking for them.

08:53.950 --> 08:55.815
You do.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.485
That's right.

08:58.538 --> 09:01.029
Ido.

09:06.421 --> 09:08.912
Do you know
about the girl in Tempe?

09:12.010 --> 09:15.298
Never meant to hurt her.

09:15.305 --> 09:19.298
Was she your first?

09:22.353 --> 09:24.844
Why did I think I could talk
to you about it?

09:24.856 --> 09:26.266
You're a cop.

09:26.274 --> 09:28.060
You punch a clock,
you collect a paycheck,

09:28.109 --> 09:29.724
and you go home
and you tell everyone

09:29.778 --> 09:32.064
what a difference you made.

09:32.113 --> 09:35.071
You're nothing
but a well-trained dog.

09:35.116 --> 09:39.075
You have no idea
what being a cop is like.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.327
You try...

09:41.372 --> 09:42.873
but you have go to home
at night,

09:42.916 --> 09:45.248
worried you didn't do enough--
maybe you missed something.

09:45.251 --> 09:50.917
You fail every day,
and you keep coming back.

09:50.965 --> 09:53.832
That’s what I do every day.

09:53.885 --> 09:55.967
Yeah.

09:56.012 --> 09:58.845
So I understand.

09:58.848 --> 10:00.554
I do.

10:02.310 --> 10:04.676
Come on, Linden.
Just keep him talking.

10:04.687 --> 10:05.767
Keep him talking.

10:05.814 --> 10:08.305
The bridge is up.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.314
Are you sure you want to go
this way?

10:10.360 --> 10:12.225
I didn’t tell you
to get on the bridge.

10:12.278 --> 10:13.859
Bridge is up.
It's the drawbridge.

10:13.905 --> 10:15.395
What's the range
on these radios?!

10:15.448 --> 10:16.904
30, 35 miles.
She's in county,

10:16.950 --> 10:19.908
but we got
multiple drawbridges.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.409
- Ballard, Fremont, University--
- Find out which ones are up.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.614
I want units
over there right now.

10:22.622 --> 10:23.737
What about Air Support?

10:23.790 --> 10:25.496
They ran out of fuel
searching the parks.

10:25.500 --> 10:28.037
It will be at least 20 minutes
before they're in the air again.

10:28.086 --> 10:30.122
Ballard and Southwest
Spokane bridges are up.

10:30.171 --> 10:31.627
Please advise.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.496
Great. They're on opposite ends
of the damn city.

10:33.508 --> 10:35.294
I want units on both of them
right now.

10:35.343 --> 10:37.004
Right now!

10:37.011 --> 10:39.844
You can talk to me.

10:39.889 --> 10:42.346
Tell me about the girl
in Tempe.

10:44.352 --> 10:46.092
You said you tried to help her.

10:46.312 --> 10:47.813
She was an addict.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.144
I listened to her beg...

10:52.193 --> 10:55.060
scream at me to let her out.

10:55.113 --> 10:59.322
No other program
would take her.

10:59.367 --> 11:02.074
Either they run out of funds,
they didn't have beds,

11:02.120 --> 11:04.111
they gave up--
it's the same story.

11:04.164 --> 11:07.656
"Let her out."
I don't-- I don't understand.

11:07.709 --> 11:08.949
Well, what do you say
to someone

11:09.002 --> 11:10.037
who's been throwing up

11:10.086 --> 11:11.826
and crying themselves dry
for three days?

11:11.838 --> 11:13.578
"You made me promise"?

11:16.259 --> 11:19.171
All I did was go to the store.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.460
She got out,

11:20.513 --> 11:23.926
and she told the neighbors
that I kidnapped her.

11:23.975 --> 11:27.593
You were detoxing her?

11:27.604 --> 11:30.846
And no one believed me.

11:32.358 --> 11:35.896
They all looked at me
like you are right now.

11:37.280 --> 11:41.364
You know, a grown man...

11:41.409 --> 11:44.651
with a teenage girl
in his house for days.

11:48.333 --> 11:51.450
I lost my ministry.

11:51.502 --> 11:53.629
I lost everything.

11:53.671 --> 11:55.502
You have no idea
what I went through.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.413
You sit there and you judge me.

11:57.467 --> 11:59.082
I lost my son.

12:01.179 --> 12:03.465
What?

12:03.514 --> 12:05.721
Did he die?

12:08.770 --> 12:11.762
No, not that.

12:11.814 --> 12:15.147
I was in a custody battle
with his father,

12:15.193 --> 12:16.774
and I ran out of money first.

12:16.819 --> 12:20.778
They said he was a more fit
parent than I was.

12:20.823 --> 12:24.361
More capable of caring
for my son.

12:24.369 --> 12:26.109
So... I understand.
I get it.

12:26.162 --> 12:28.574
50 bucks says
she starts crying.

12:37.006 --> 12:38.212
You think that's funny?

12:38.258 --> 12:39.498
That's funny to you?

12:39.550 --> 12:42.132
Get out of here
before I break your face.

12:45.932 --> 12:48.173
Turn in here.

12:48.226 --> 12:50.808
What is this place?

12:50.853 --> 12:52.138
Just do what I tell you.

12:53.648 --> 12:56.264
What's going on?

12:56.317 --> 12:59.684
Battery's dying,
or they're moving out of range.

12:59.696 --> 13:01.937
Come on, Linden.

13:17.672 --> 13:19.128
Why are we here?

13:19.173 --> 13:20.879
Keep driving.

13:30.518 --> 13:32.133
Over there.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.174
Why are we here?

14:04.802 --> 14:08.886
I used to find them
hanging out down here.

14:08.931 --> 14:12.173
Turn off the car.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.972
You...

14:15.021 --> 14:16.727
can explain...

14:16.731 --> 14:18.267
what really happened.

14:18.274 --> 14:19.730
They'll believe you.

14:19.734 --> 14:22.271
No, they won't.

14:22.320 --> 14:26.188
You didn't, did you?

14:26.240 --> 14:28.777
You don't have to do this.

14:28.826 --> 14:31.442
Turn it off.

14:56.104 --> 14:59.596
I'm having a cigarette.

15:24.882 --> 15:27.749
I lied to you before.

15:31.347 --> 15:33.133
About my son.

15:37.019 --> 15:40.386
I didn't lose him
in a custody battle.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.601
Nobody took him from me.

15:42.650 --> 15:46.518
I lost him all on my own.

15:46.529 --> 15:48.485
I let him go.

15:54.787 --> 16:02.330
I didn't know how to tell him...
"This is all I've got".

16:04.422 --> 16:06.788
"I can't give you...

16:06.841 --> 16:08.502
any more.

16:08.551 --> 16:12.135
This is what I am."

16:17.143 --> 16:19.509
When he was 4 or 5,

16:19.562 --> 16:22.725
Iused to...

16:22.773 --> 16:26.436
come home
and he'd hear me and...

16:26.486 --> 16:28.568
run and hide under the blankets
of my bed.

16:28.613 --> 16:30.604
There'd just be
this big lump...

16:30.656 --> 16:33.318
right in the middle, and...

16:33.367 --> 16:36.985
I'd pull back the covers...

16:37.038 --> 16:40.405
act like
it was a big surprise...

16:40.458 --> 16:42.494
that he was in there.

16:42.543 --> 16:44.659
He'd start cracking up.

16:48.174 --> 16:51.166
And that was it.
That was...

16:51.219 --> 16:53.255
That was all he wanted.

16:55.932 --> 16:58.890
He must've done it
a hundred times.

17:01.312 --> 17:03.303
Sometimes the ones who hide

17:03.356 --> 17:06.314
are the ones who want
to be found the most.

17:15.451 --> 17:17.567
I don't want to be here.

17:20.414 --> 17:22.791
Can you take me to the water?

17:24.293 --> 17:25.794
Please?

17:25.836 --> 17:27.451
Yeah.

17:45.940 --> 17:48.522
Where are we going now?

17:56.242 --> 17:59.780
You said you wanted...
to go... water.

18:01.122 --> 18:03.909
Where near the water?

18:11.173 --> 18:14.301
That bridge over there--
is that where we're going?

18:17.513 --> 18:20.300
I found my friend
standing there...

18:20.349 --> 18:22.761
up on that bridge one night.

18:22.810 --> 18:25.927
Standing right in the middle
of the highway.

18:27.982 --> 18:30.268
Why are you telling me this?

18:30.318 --> 18:34.561
He had lost hope, too.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.855
He thought
there was no going back.

18:36.907 --> 18:39.865
But there's always a way back.

18:39.910 --> 18:41.116
A way home.

18:42.330 --> 18:44.787
What he... did.

18:46.834 --> 18:49.450
- The damn battery's going.
- Shut up.

18:49.503 --> 18:50.538
He didn’t think
he could make it right.

18:50.588 --> 18:51.873
But I found him there.

18:51.922 --> 18:54.174
He was lost
and had nowhere to go.

18:54.216 --> 18:56.298
He was standing
on the median--

18:56.344 --> 18:58.630
alone, hopeless.

18:58.679 --> 19:00.055
He was my good friend,

19:00.056 --> 19:01.921
and he was up on that bridge

19:01.974 --> 19:04.260
thinking he didn’t have
anyone left.

19:04.310 --> 19:05.675
The Biltmore pier.

19:05.728 --> 19:07.514
The Biltmore pier.
She's at the Biltmore pier!

19:07.563 --> 19:08.894
All available units,

19:08.939 --> 19:10.850
Linden's taking the suspect
to Biltmore pier.

19:10.900 --> 19:12.856
- Get over there right now!
- Copy that.

19:15.821 --> 19:20.360
I let it happen again
with Angie.

19:22.953 --> 19:25.695
She would rather bleed to death
in a drain pipe

19:25.706 --> 19:29.415
than go to a hospital,
go back into the system.

19:29.460 --> 19:31.325
You were the one
that took her to the vet.

19:31.379 --> 19:33.870
Angie Gower.

19:42.056 --> 19:45.844
I paid him $800 in small bills.

19:45.893 --> 19:48.305
Donation money.

19:48.354 --> 19:50.640
There was a whole bunch
of ones in there.

19:50.648 --> 19:51.763
You found it, right?

19:51.816 --> 19:52.931
Yes, we did.

19:52.983 --> 19:55.941
You should have told us
the truth.

19:55.986 --> 20:00.355
Would you have believed me,
knowing about Tempe?

20:20.302 --> 20:23.840
What is that?

20:23.889 --> 20:27.097
Give it to me.

20:27.143 --> 20:28.258
Give it to me!

20:28.310 --> 20:29.470
Hang on a second!

20:31.147 --> 20:33.729
I haven't touched it.

20:33.774 --> 20:35.890
No one's coming.
It's just us.

20:39.405 --> 20:40.861
Pull the car over.

20:51.375 --> 20:53.616
You don't have to do this!

20:53.669 --> 20:54.784
Listen to me.

20:54.837 --> 20:57.624
You don't have to do this.

20:57.673 --> 21:00.460
You're making a mistake.

21:00.468 --> 21:03.460
Please.

21:06.474 --> 21:09.181
Just talk to me.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.849
We can talk.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.479
Get on your knees.

21:15.524 --> 21:18.561
I'm right here.
Just talk to me.

21:20.988 --> 21:22.899
Don't do this.
Please.

21:24.867 --> 21:26.903
Oh, God.

21:36.670 --> 21:39.047
Please.

22:05.533 --> 22:08.070
Please forgive me, Father.

22:10.663 --> 22:14.531
I've fallen so short.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.033
I don't know what to do.

22:23.968 --> 22:26.550
I failed them.

22:51.370 --> 22:54.453
On the pier--
get your hands in the air!

22:54.498 --> 22:55.874
Show me your hands!

22:55.875 --> 22:57.991
- Put your hands in the air!
- Show me your hands! Stand up!

22:58.002 --> 23:00.084
- Show me your hands!
- Get up!

23:00.129 --> 23:02.871
Get your hands
out of your pockets.

23:02.882 --> 23:04.873
Get your hands
out of your pockets!

23:04.925 --> 23:06.586
Get your hands out
or they'll shoot you!

23:06.635 --> 23:08.751
He doesn't have a gun!
Don't shoot him! He doesn't have a gun!

23:08.804 --> 23:10.669
Take your hands
out of your pockets!

23:12.141 --> 23:14.427
You make these men shoot you,
they'll carry it all their lives.

23:14.435 --> 23:16.426
Get out of the way, Sarah.

23:16.478 --> 23:18.093
- On your knees!
- He doesn't have a gun.

23:23.569 --> 23:25.776
On the ground.
On the ground!

23:25.821 --> 23:28.779
Check that he's secure.

23:28.824 --> 23:31.065
No weapons!

23:34.997 --> 23:37.955
Let's go.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.538
Watch yourself.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.314
Did you talk to the cop?

24:54.159 --> 24:56.320
No, she hasn't
returned my calls.

24:56.453 --> 24:58.114
I need to talk to her.

24:58.163 --> 25:00.199
There must be something
she can do.

25:00.290 --> 25:02.281
She said she believes
I'm innocent.

25:02.292 --> 25:04.283
Ray...

25:04.336 --> 25:06.668
all your appeals,
the final decisions,

25:06.714 --> 25:08.045
they've come and gone.

25:08.090 --> 25:10.251
But-- but she helped
put me away,

25:10.300 --> 25:11.961
so there's got to be something.

25:12.011 --> 25:13.376
I'm sorry.

25:13.429 --> 25:18.389
If she had anything meaningful,
we'd have known by now.

25:18.434 --> 25:20.550
There's got to be something.

25:23.939 --> 25:27.227
I don't want to hang.

25:27.276 --> 25:29.688
I'll take injection.

25:29.737 --> 25:34.481
I need to ask you...

25:34.491 --> 25:36.823
after it's done...

25:39.038 --> 25:41.029
your remains--

25:41.040 --> 25:43.531
I need your instructions
on what to do with them.

25:46.712 --> 25:49.454
You need to talk to that cop.

25:49.506 --> 25:54.170
If you don't make a decision,

25:54.219 --> 25:56.380
uh, there's the county grave.

25:56.430 --> 25:59.547
It's just a marker
and a number.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.465
I'm sorry, Ray.

26:12.988 --> 26:14.944
On the gate!

26:16.992 --> 26:19.199
Come on.

26:20.621 --> 26:22.987
Come on.
Come on, inmate!

26:23.040 --> 26:24.905
- Jesus!
- What the hell's going on?

26:24.917 --> 26:26.532
What's wrong with him?!

26:26.585 --> 26:28.041
Seward! Look at me.
Look at me!

26:28.087 --> 26:29.577
Damn it!

26:29.630 --> 26:32.087
Damn it, I said look at me!

26:32.132 --> 26:33.997
Look at me.
Look at me!

26:34.051 --> 26:36.463
Stay looking in my eyes.
Stay right here.

26:36.512 --> 26:38.503
You're not dying!
You hear me?

26:38.514 --> 26:41.972
You're not gonna die!
I want you to breathe.

26:42.476 --> 26:44.683
Slow the hell down.
Just breathe.

26:46.396 --> 26:47.806
Keep looking at me.
You'll be all right.

26:49.024 --> 26:51.731
You're having a panic attack.
That's all.

26:51.777 --> 26:53.313
Just breathe.

26:53.362 --> 26:55.774
Just breathe.

26:59.243 --> 27:00.733
That's it.

27:02.913 --> 27:04.904
Okay?

27:04.915 --> 27:06.826
Okay.

27:08.752 --> 27:09.787
What are you looking at?

27:09.837 --> 27:13.421
Let's go. Get up.
Get up. Come on.

27:18.971 --> 27:23.431
Sorry, Detective Linden,
there’s no smoking in here.

27:26.103 --> 27:28.310
- Detective Linden.
- What?

27:28.355 --> 27:30.266
How's she doing?

27:30.274 --> 27:32.060
She's giving them hell.

27:32.109 --> 27:33.269
I'm sorry.
I can’t tell you more...

27:33.318 --> 27:35.479
What about the Pastor?

27:35.529 --> 27:37.269
The lab said the blood
in his car

27:37.281 --> 27:39.237
is a match for Angie Gower.

27:39.283 --> 27:41.274
But no other blood was present.

27:41.326 --> 27:43.282
He's not our guy.

27:43.328 --> 27:44.488
I have work to do.

27:44.538 --> 27:46.529
He didn't do the girls
in the retention pond.

27:46.582 --> 27:49.494
He was in Mexico City
for most of '09.

27:49.543 --> 27:51.659
We just got confirmation
from the embassy.

27:51.712 --> 27:53.293
...by the waterfront
this morning.

27:53.338 --> 27:56.296
And that girl, the one your CI

27:56.341 --> 27:58.297
alleged was with the Pastor?

27:58.302 --> 28:02.466
Patrol just picked her up
a half-hour ago.

28:02.514 --> 28:04.675
She was out hustling--

28:04.683 --> 28:06.639
all night.

28:06.685 --> 28:08.676
No, he had her at his house.

28:08.729 --> 28:10.060
She walked out.

28:10.105 --> 28:11.845
Simple as that.

28:17.404 --> 28:21.443
So your CI lied to you.

28:24.286 --> 28:26.823
So you make this right.

28:43.263 --> 28:45.379
The hell...?

28:45.432 --> 28:47.263
You junkyard little bitch.

28:47.267 --> 28:49.053
You almost got
my partner killed.

28:49.102 --> 28:50.182
You lie to me?

28:50.229 --> 28:51.969
After what I've done for you?

28:52.022 --> 28:54.684
You think you can sit there
and lie to my face?

28:56.109 --> 28:57.565
Get off me!

28:57.611 --> 28:59.818
You get out of here right now

28:59.863 --> 29:01.945
before I kick your little wannabe
ass right here right now.

29:01.949 --> 29:05.237
You ain't done nothing for me.

29:05.285 --> 29:07.776
Kallie's still out there.
You ain't found her.

29:07.829 --> 29:10.286
You ain't found nothing!

29:10.332 --> 29:11.947
You get out of here right now

29:12.042 --> 29:14.829
before I bury your ass so deep
in the foster-care system

29:14.878 --> 29:16.038
you'll never get out.

29:18.548 --> 29:20.163
Yeah, that's right.

29:20.259 --> 29:22.250
I'm not your friend.

29:22.302 --> 29:25.044
I don't give a shit about you.

29:25.097 --> 29:26.758
You're just a nobody,

29:26.807 --> 29:29.890
nothing, punk-ass kid.

29:29.935 --> 29:32.176
Now get out!

29:32.229 --> 29:33.810
Get out of here.

29:33.855 --> 29:34.844
Get out of here!

29:34.898 --> 29:37.355
Go to hell!

30:11.351 --> 30:14.184
...and while Pastor
Mike Sheehan has been arrested

30:14.187 --> 30:16.178
for the role he played
in this morning '5 kidnapping,

30:16.273 --> 30:17.388
he is no longer a suspect

30:17.441 --> 30:18.726
in our ongoing
serial investigation.

30:18.775 --> 30:20.390
It’s been over three weeks

30:20.402 --> 30:21.733
since the bodies
were recovered.

30:21.778 --> 30:23.154
Are you any closer
to an arrest?

30:23.196 --> 30:24.322
The bottom line is,

30:24.364 --> 30:25.444
my guys are working
24 hours a day

30:25.490 --> 30:26.775
following every possible lead.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.656
Lieutenant,
are you losing confidence

30:28.702 --> 30:31.159
in the ability of the task force
to even catch this killer?

30:31.204 --> 30:34.332
Absolutely not. I have full
confiden--

30:41.965 --> 30:43.580
You left your keys in the door.

30:43.633 --> 30:47.592
I got chow mein, egg rolls,
lemon chicken for you,

30:47.637 --> 30:49.502
and fortune cookies.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.259
What more could you want?

31:03.570 --> 31:06.277
Lyric!

31:06.281 --> 31:08.363
Lyric, what the hell?
Are you okay?

31:08.408 --> 31:09.693
Where have you been?
What happened?

31:09.701 --> 31:11.282
Nothing. Jesus.

31:12.204 --> 31:14.286
You told the cops
I was missing?

31:14.498 --> 31:15.829
They questioned me out here
for like an hour.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.330
They called my parents.

31:17.376 --> 31:18.866
Why didn't you call me,
find me, something?

31:18.877 --> 31:21.664
Find you?
I don't belong to you.

31:24.758 --> 31:27.966
I'm with Twitch.
Okay?

31:28.011 --> 31:31.879
Sorry.

31:31.932 --> 31:34.298
I'm not gay.

31:34.351 --> 31:36.307
You know?

31:50.033 --> 31:51.819
Yo, Poochie.

31:51.868 --> 31:53.904
You holding?

31:53.912 --> 31:56.244
Yeah. So?
You don't mess with no junk.

31:56.289 --> 31:58.075
Look, just sell to me or don't.

31:58.125 --> 32:00.286
I ain't got time
for your ratchet ass.

32:00.335 --> 32:01.950
It's all good, girl.
Damn.

32:03.588 --> 32:05.624
So, what, you want points?

32:12.848 --> 32:16.056
Any word on Kallie?

32:16.101 --> 32:18.467
It sucks, yo.
I'm sorry.

32:18.520 --> 32:21.683
Whatever.
Later.

32:21.731 --> 32:23.858
Hey, you be careful, B.

32:23.900 --> 32:26.061
Some girl copped from
me not two hours ago.

32:26.069 --> 32:27.400
She got a finger chopped off.

32:29.406 --> 32:30.816
What do you mean?

32:33.034 --> 32:34.160
It's crazy, rig ht?

32:34.202 --> 32:36.067
Said she was gettin'
the hell out of dodge.

32:40.750 --> 32:43.958
Thanks for the takeout.
Nice of you to do that.

32:44.004 --> 32:46.962
Yeah, well, you are welcome.

32:48.592 --> 32:51.049
I needed an excuse
to get out of there anyway.

32:52.429 --> 32:54.966
If one more person
asks me if I was all right,

32:55.015 --> 32:56.175
I swear...

32:59.394 --> 33:01.385
Well, are you all right?

33:04.399 --> 33:06.435
Yeah. I'm fine.

33:09.029 --> 33:11.771
Thought I lost you there
for a second.

33:11.781 --> 33:14.443
Just when I was getting used
to you.

33:16.536 --> 33:18.151
That was scary, huh?

33:28.965 --> 33:30.876
I couldn't see him, you know?

33:30.926 --> 33:32.837
Just his eyes in the mirror.

33:36.056 --> 33:38.718
And his voice.

33:41.561 --> 33:43.552
I kept thinking that

33:43.563 --> 33:47.647
this must have been what it was
like for all those girls.

33:47.692 --> 33:50.434
How alone they must have felt.

33:53.406 --> 33:57.900
Just his eyes, you know,
looking at them.

33:57.953 --> 34:01.320
Knowing that that was the last
thing that they were gonna see.

34:05.961 --> 34:09.124
Only it wasn't him.

34:09.172 --> 34:12.164
I should have got there sooner.

34:12.175 --> 34:15.133
You got there.
You found me.

34:32.195 --> 34:35.483
You go through that thing
every night or what?

34:38.493 --> 34:41.075
They're gonna kill him
in two days.

34:58.138 --> 34:59.753
Francis didn't happen
to tell you

34:59.806 --> 35:01.637
where he was going after work,
did he?

35:01.683 --> 35:03.969
Um...

35:04.019 --> 35:06.135
just going home.

35:06.146 --> 35:11.766
He hasn't been home
in a couple of days.

35:11.818 --> 35:14.275
Look, I know what you must
think of me,

35:14.279 --> 35:18.318
but... it ain't easy
living with a man like him.

35:20.327 --> 35:22.568
Well, he's got a temper,
but he's not a bad guy.

35:22.621 --> 35:25.909
Sometimes he doesn't come
home for nights on end.

35:25.957 --> 35:28.289
And when he comes home,

35:28.335 --> 35:32.248
he looks at me...

35:32.255 --> 35:34.587
like he hates me.

35:39.763 --> 35:41.970
I'm... sorry.
I don't know what I can do.

35:42.015 --> 35:43.926
I don't have anyone
to talk to.

35:43.975 --> 35:46.967
I'm scared.

35:46.978 --> 35:50.141
Can you just sit with me?

35:50.190 --> 35:53.808
Just for a little while.

35:53.860 --> 35:55.851
Ijust need somebody--

35:55.862 --> 35:57.523
just to talk to.

36:04.829 --> 36:05.989
I'm sorry.

36:21.388 --> 36:23.629
You're Angie, right?

36:23.682 --> 36:25.138
Who the hell are you?

36:25.141 --> 36:27.257
Bullet, friend of Poochie's.

36:27.310 --> 36:29.346
So?

36:29.354 --> 36:31.436
Look, you want to take off.

36:31.481 --> 36:32.687
I get that.

36:32.732 --> 36:35.189
But there are a lot of girls
that are still out there

36:35.235 --> 36:36.190
that need your help.

36:36.236 --> 36:37.567
No, I can't.

36:37.570 --> 36:39.435
The man...

36:40.615 --> 36:41.821
he’ll ﬁnd you...

36:41.866 --> 36:44.573
he'll find me ifI stay.

36:44.619 --> 36:46.280
He'll kill me.

36:46.329 --> 36:49.287
And ain't nothing
no one gonna do about it.

36:50.834 --> 36:51.914
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.

36:51.918 --> 36:55.536
- I-I told you I saw Poochie, right?
- Yeah, so did I.

36:55.588 --> 36:57.795
Hey, look.
Look, it's a long ride.

36:57.799 --> 36:59.835
- I can help take the edge off.
- I got what I need.

36:59.884 --> 37:01.135
Yeah?

37:01.136 --> 37:03.377
What about when you get there?

37:03.430 --> 37:05.466
Dope sick ain't no way
to start a new life.

37:05.515 --> 37:06.675
This is yours.

37:06.683 --> 37:08.924
Just tell me who he is.

37:08.977 --> 37:11.184
I can't.

37:11.271 --> 37:13.353
Please.

37:19.863 --> 37:21.444
There's nothing new here.

37:21.448 --> 37:23.063
I've been through these
a million times.

37:23.116 --> 37:25.607
The guy loves his kid.

37:25.660 --> 37:27.446
That ain't no grift.

37:27.495 --> 37:30.111
Birthday candle,
ding-dong.

37:30.165 --> 37:33.999
It's more than my pops
ever done for me.

37:34.043 --> 37:36.500
You're right.
I think he does care.

37:36.546 --> 37:38.457
He's still gonna die.

37:41.134 --> 37:44.843
My nephew Davie...

37:44.846 --> 37:47.929
pops ran out on him, too,
before he was even born.

37:50.393 --> 37:54.432
Told myself-- I promised
that I'd be that to him.

37:54.481 --> 37:58.269
'Cause he didn't have
anyone else.

38:00.779 --> 38:03.771
Didn't stop me
from stealing from him.

38:03.782 --> 38:06.615
You're there for them now,
right?

38:06.618 --> 38:09.610
Don't change what happened.

38:09.662 --> 38:12.745
Doesn't matter how long
I'll be clean.

38:12.791 --> 38:16.784
They're always gonna be
looking at me like...

38:21.257 --> 38:24.624
Just waiting for me to fail.

38:24.677 --> 38:26.884
That wasn't the impression
your sister gave me.

38:26.930 --> 38:29.296
Or your nephew.

38:29.349 --> 38:32.261
Maybe it's you who needs
to let go of the past.

38:37.148 --> 38:40.436
That makes two of us, huh?

38:50.328 --> 38:52.284
VobSub2SRT ERROR: OCR failure!

38:56.334 --> 38:58.165
Look”.

38:58.253 --> 39:00.335
all I'm saying is,
there's no telling

39:00.380 --> 39:03.292
what Seward might have done
even if he loved his kid.

39:03.341 --> 39:05.878
So you think he did it.

39:05.927 --> 39:08.714
What proof we got otherwise?

39:08.721 --> 39:11.929
When we find the guy,
then we'll know.

39:13.935 --> 39:16.096
And speaking of--
I gotta get some sleep.

39:16.145 --> 39:18.761
Take a shower.

39:18.773 --> 39:20.434
Hoo!

39:20.483 --> 39:22.064
It's real bad.

39:22.110 --> 39:26.319
It's real bad.

39:26.322 --> 39:30.110
Back to Joe Mills' home videos
first thing.

39:38.084 --> 39:40.496
You got tunnel vision.

39:40.545 --> 39:42.035
Let me take a crack at this.

39:43.256 --> 39:44.291
Mm.

39:46.843 --> 39:48.754
Knock yourself out.

39:48.970 --> 39:50.756
You've reached
Detective Stephen Holder.

39:50.805 --> 39:52.090
Leave a message.

39:52.140 --> 39:53.721
Holder

39:53.766 --> 39:56.143
Look, I know I messed up, man,

39:56.269 --> 39:58.305
but I got something for you,
for real.

39:58.354 --> 40:01.016
Call me back
as soon as you can.

40:01.065 --> 40:04.432
I know who he is.

40:08.948 --> 40:10.358
Hey, I been here five minutes.

40:10.408 --> 40:11.989
- A menu would be nice.
- Yep!

40:26.758 --> 40:29.374
You have a prepaid call
from Elliot Bay Penitentiary.

40:29.427 --> 40:30.883
Hello?

40:30.929 --> 40:32.965
Did you talk to Adrian?

40:32.972 --> 40:34.212
No.

40:34.265 --> 40:35.505
His foster parents
won't let me.

40:35.558 --> 40:37.514
Yeah, but you think
he knows something,

40:37.560 --> 40:39.516
and that's why
you want to talk to him.

40:42.690 --> 40:44.806
I can make that happen.

40:44.859 --> 40:47.475
I didn't kill my wife.

40:47.528 --> 40:50.520
I wasn't there,
and you believe me, don't you?

40:53.534 --> 40:54.910
I do, yes.

40:54.953 --> 40:56.409
Yeah, well, I'm running
out of time.

40:56.454 --> 41:00.788
I'll make sure
you can talk to Adrian.

41:00.792 --> 41:02.407
You need to help me.

41:02.418 --> 41:05.000
Please.

41:32.740 --> 41:34.947
You've reached
Detective Stephen Holder.

41:34.993 --> 41:36.483
Leave a message.
