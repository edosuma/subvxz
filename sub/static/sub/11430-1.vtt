00:20.146 --> 00:24.025
My name's Kyle and I
wanna be a policeman.

00:28.613 --> 00:31.282
I'm Gordon.
I wanna be a lawyer.

00:36.329 --> 00:39.499
My name's Martha
and I'm a T. Rex!

00:40.959 --> 00:42.127
Okay, Martha.

00:45.213 --> 00:48.675
<i>Take me on a date
I deserve it, babe</i>

00:48.883 --> 00:50.885
Okay.
You can do this.

00:51.845 --> 00:53.346
No, I'm gonna
delete that one.

00:53.471 --> 00:54.597
Hey, what's up?

00:54.681 --> 00:57.767
"My girlfriend just sent me
the sexiest photo."

00:59.477 --> 01:02.313
Ah, that looks like a butt.
My boobs look like a butt?

01:02.480 --> 01:05.108
Just hangin' out in your
favorite shirt and lingerie.

01:05.483 --> 01:07.026
Oh, boy.
None of these are good.

01:07.736 --> 01:10.947
<i>Dear future husband,
Here's a few things</i>

01:11.030 --> 01:14.075
<i>You'll need to know
If you wanna be</i>

01:14.159 --> 01:17.370
<i>My one and only
All my life</i>

01:20.165 --> 01:23.752
<i>You gotta know how to
Treat me like a lady</i>

01:24.836 --> 01:27.130
<i>Even when I'm acting crazy</i>

01:27.213 --> 01:29.632
<i>Tell me everything's
All right</i>

01:31.926 --> 01:35.680
<i>Future husband,
Better love me right</i>

01:55.366 --> 01:59.204
I mean, was I cheating on you?
Yes, maybe.

02:00.205 --> 02:02.457
Ugh! I'm such an asshole,
okay? I know.

02:02.624 --> 02:04.542
Do you think that
I like being like this?

02:04.709 --> 02:08.378
I just need validation all the time.
It's pathetic.

02:08.545 --> 02:11.716
But I think that's something
you can work on.

02:13.718 --> 02:16.387
Yeah, this is super-fucked.

02:16.554 --> 02:19.307
But maybe...

02:20.225 --> 02:22.936
...it's a new beginning.
Right?

02:25.146 --> 02:26.648
Oh, wow.

02:27.982 --> 02:29.818
I like your nail polish.

02:30.151 --> 02:31.486
I'm just gonna...

02:32.237 --> 02:34.489
...grab this little fella.

02:35.657 --> 02:38.368
This is what I'm talking about, Martha.

02:38.451 --> 02:40.245
You've got no
sense of adventure.

02:55.093 --> 02:56.427
Hey,
watch it.

02:56.928 --> 02:58.596
Hey, have a nice day.

03:09.566 --> 03:12.861
<i>Take a look
around the room</i>

03:13.486 --> 03:16.781
<i>Love comes
wearing disguises</i>

03:17.615 --> 03:21.077
<i>How to go about
and choose?</i>

03:21.786 --> 03:25.123
<i>Break it down by
shapes and sizes</i>

03:25.832 --> 03:31.838
<i>I'm a man who's got
very specific taste</i>

03:33.923 --> 03:37.260
<i>You-you-you're
Just my type</i>

03:37.343 --> 03:41.389
<i>Oh, you got a pulse
And you are breathing</i>

03:42.098 --> 03:45.143
<i>You-you-you're
Just my type</i>

03:49.898 --> 03:52.567
Hi. Hey. Sharon?

03:52.984 --> 03:54.903
Yeah.
How are you?

03:55.904 --> 03:58.698
Is that Chanel?
I like it.

03:59.073 --> 04:00.325
What, are you with
the hotel?

04:00.491 --> 04:02.291
Because I need some...
No, no, I'm actually...

04:02.327 --> 04:03.411
...supposed to
be in Milwaukee,

04:03.494 --> 04:05.413
killing your husband before he
can take your half of the firm.

04:05.580 --> 04:06.740
That's what
it's about, right?

04:06.831 --> 04:09.191
They don't tell me much,
but that's what I could figure out.

04:09.250 --> 04:12.211
I was really proud of myself for that.
Gee whiz.

04:12.837 --> 04:15.089
Look, I... Don't hurt my feelings,
Sharon.

04:15.173 --> 04:18.426
You contacted a fixer to hire
someone to kill your husband.

04:19.552 --> 04:20.803
Huh?

04:21.596 --> 04:22.680
Okay.

04:23.598 --> 04:26.935
So if you're not there,
then why are you here?

04:27.268 --> 04:29.103
Murder's wrong, Sharon.

04:30.271 --> 04:31.856
But you're a hitman.

04:32.023 --> 04:33.483
Nobody's perfect.

04:40.031 --> 04:44.577
You're gonna come home
and look at me like I'm uptight

04:44.744 --> 04:47.038
'cause I don't
wanna have a threesome?

04:47.205 --> 04:49.415
You asshole! 'Cause I'm not so cool.
Martha?

04:49.582 --> 04:52.251
It's Sophie. Are you okay?
You don't even know me!

04:52.710 --> 04:53.962
She's not okay.

04:54.045 --> 04:55.630
No, because you
didn't bring the...

04:55.964 --> 04:58.549
Why would you bring... That
doesn't even make any sense.

04:58.716 --> 05:01.386
She's doing drunk closet.
She's regressed to college.

05:01.552 --> 05:03.012
We've gotta
open the door.

05:03.096 --> 05:04.639
And I need you to keep your
eyes to the ground

05:04.722 --> 05:07.892
because she takes direct eye
contact as a sign of aggression.

05:08.059 --> 05:10.395
We're coming in.
No! No!

05:10.561 --> 05:12.563
This is my whole zone!

05:12.647 --> 05:14.649
This is for me!

05:14.816 --> 05:17.485
You stop judging me,
'cause these are my favorite socks!

05:17.652 --> 05:19.404
And I have only been
drinking for two days.

05:19.570 --> 05:23.574
Martha, you look...
I feel assumptions from you.

05:23.741 --> 05:26.244
I feel judgment from you.
You don't know the situation.

05:26.411 --> 05:28.913
You don't know
what's in my heart.

05:29.080 --> 05:30.415
'Cause you're racist!

05:30.581 --> 05:31.666
Okay. Whoa!
No!

05:31.833 --> 05:34.502
And you smell weird!
I'm sorry, you don't.

05:34.669 --> 05:36.004
Julia, I'm gonna
need your help.

05:36.087 --> 05:38.089
No, I am not touching her.
She seems sticky.

05:38.256 --> 05:40.967
Get physical with me,
and I will get physical with you!

05:41.134 --> 05:42.677
One, two, there we go.

05:42.844 --> 05:44.262
You unhand me,
you brute!

05:44.429 --> 05:46.180
Come on.
No, I don't wanna leave, no!

05:46.347 --> 05:48.766
Martha...
No! You can't stop me!

05:48.933 --> 05:52.103
No! One of you hussies
is getting fisted!

05:56.441 --> 05:58.361
Okay, he's heading
towards the elevator.

05:58.443 --> 06:01.362
ETA two minutes. Espinoza's
team is already in position.

06:01.529 --> 06:04.365
For the money this guy's worth,
I'm gonna do my thing big.

06:04.782 --> 06:06.951
Don't let this joker start
doing that thing he does.

06:07.118 --> 06:09.662
Amen, brother.
Fucking dance party is canceled!

06:09.787 --> 06:11.372
Yeah!

06:16.044 --> 06:17.503
Hey, Hopper,
you coming, or what?

06:17.628 --> 06:18.629
No.

06:20.465 --> 06:23.134
Nope, I made a mistake.
I thought you guys were professional.

06:23.843 --> 06:26.679
But that's okay.
That's okay.

06:27.346 --> 06:29.974
Someone's gotta return the
van after he kills you all.

06:30.141 --> 06:32.518
Yeah,
whatever, pussy.

06:33.394 --> 06:34.479
Break a leg.

06:38.858 --> 06:40.151
Here we go then.

06:40.485 --> 06:42.695
<i>Stopping elevator now.</i>
Well, that's a mistake.

06:42.862 --> 06:44.822
<i>What the hell? He's not in here.</i>
Oh, yes, he is.

06:44.989 --> 06:47.325
<i>What the fuck?
How's he moving like that?</i>

06:47.700 --> 06:50.203
<i>Catch up! He's right there!</i>
No, he isn't.

06:52.538 --> 06:54.499
Wow. Pretty.

06:54.665 --> 06:56.834
Balloons. Wedding?
Nice job.

06:57.001 --> 06:59.170
Listen, there's been
a fire down the hall,

06:59.253 --> 07:00.755
so everyone's
gonna have to evacuate.

07:01.047 --> 07:02.507
<i>He's going in the ballroom,
take him down!</i>

07:02.673 --> 07:04.550
Don't follow him
into an open space.

07:04.717 --> 07:07.220
Fire! Now! Fire!

07:09.305 --> 07:12.266
<i>When I die and they
Lay me to rest</i>

07:12.350 --> 07:16.354
<i>Gonna go to the place
That's the best</i>

07:17.396 --> 07:19.732
Die, motherfucker!
Yeah!

07:19.857 --> 07:24.362
<i>Goin' up to the
Spirit in the sky</i>

07:24.445 --> 07:27.824
<i>Goin' up to the
Spirit in the sky</i>

07:28.407 --> 07:29.567
<i>I got him in my sight.</i>

07:35.581 --> 07:37.708
- That's a shame.
- I liked her.

07:40.211 --> 07:43.965
<i>Never been a sinner
I never sinned</i>

07:44.048 --> 07:46.175
<i>I got a friend in Jesus</i>

07:46.259 --> 07:47.593
He's by the cake!

07:48.219 --> 07:50.721
<i>So you know that
When I die</i>

07:50.888 --> 07:52.390
Well, if he's
by the cake...

07:53.099 --> 07:54.392
...that means
he's got a knife.

07:57.937 --> 07:59.230
Fuck me.

08:01.107 --> 08:02.567
You son of a bitch!

08:05.903 --> 08:09.365
<i>I'm gonna go to the place
That's the best</i>

08:13.411 --> 08:14.662
Who shoots cake?

08:16.914 --> 08:19.333
<i>This would have been
such a nice wedding.</i>

08:19.917 --> 08:22.086
Well, that was fun...

08:22.587 --> 08:23.629
...ish.

08:26.090 --> 08:28.634
I'm not a racist. I'm not.
I know you're not a racist.

08:28.801 --> 08:30.428
Heads up! Whoa!
Hey, are you feeling...

08:30.595 --> 08:31.637
Ah! What the fuck?

08:31.971 --> 08:33.222
What if that was a bullet?

08:33.306 --> 08:34.765
I'm training you.
You're welcome.

08:34.932 --> 08:38.311
Guys, let's go out, you know?
Let's get out of here.

08:38.477 --> 08:40.770
It's New Orleans.
You know, like,

08:40.938 --> 08:43.607
we're young and free,
and we should find a block party.

08:43.774 --> 08:45.776
We could find one
with a contest or something.

08:45.943 --> 08:49.155
Like, a contest
for our bodies.

08:49.322 --> 08:51.115
And we show, like...

08:51.449 --> 08:53.326
...our boobs or something.
I don't know.

08:53.492 --> 08:56.120
But I wanna do something...

08:56.287 --> 08:57.663
...terrible.

08:57.830 --> 09:00.708
I wanna do something terrible.

09:04.003 --> 09:05.463
Are you okay?

09:07.215 --> 09:10.343
Excuse me.
Hello, ladies.

09:10.509 --> 09:12.637
What's this?
That was a piÃ±a colada

09:12.803 --> 09:17.183
but I drank it, so now it's an
empty cup for my friend Julia.

09:17.350 --> 09:19.185
Oh, my God.

09:19.352 --> 09:20.519
Jesus Christ.

09:20.811 --> 09:23.814
Is he here?
I knew this was a good bar!

09:24.190 --> 09:25.650
I'm gonna go find him.

09:38.204 --> 09:40.164
Oh! Oh!

09:43.584 --> 09:44.585
What?

09:46.003 --> 09:49.715
What the hell?
I'm the fucking man right now!

09:56.597 --> 09:58.599
Oh, my gosh, she's texting.
Who is she texting?

09:58.683 --> 10:00.685
Who are you texting?
Nobody.

10:02.186 --> 10:04.480
Do you think if I text him I'm
pregnant it would change anything?

10:04.563 --> 10:07.692
Is there a pregnant emoticon?
Like, pregnant?

10:07.858 --> 10:09.402
What if I text him
that I'm dying?

10:09.568 --> 10:11.529
What if I text him
that he's dying?

10:11.696 --> 10:14.282
Because I'm going
to murder you, you...

10:14.365 --> 10:15.491
Okay, give me that.

10:15.574 --> 10:17.368
Okay. I'm not watching you
repeat yourself.

10:17.451 --> 10:18.536
You're like the Little
Engine That Could

10:18.619 --> 10:19.954
that just keeps
running off the tracks.

10:20.037 --> 10:22.039
I am stopping this train.
No more.

10:23.165 --> 10:26.085
I'm sorry. I am.
You know, I'm sorry, Sophie.

10:26.168 --> 10:29.130
You're so good to me, and I don't
know how this keeps happening.

10:29.213 --> 10:30.965
Do I just suck?
No.

10:31.048 --> 10:34.010
Am I just like
Suckball McGee over here?

10:34.093 --> 10:36.595
No, you're not Suckball McGee.
Oh, come here.

10:37.179 --> 10:39.265
You know what?
You're just a work in progress, babe.

10:39.849 --> 10:41.267
Oh!
Sophie. Okay.

10:41.434 --> 10:43.227
Why don't you come to work
with me tomorrow?

10:43.519 --> 10:44.603
Really?
Yeah.

10:44.770 --> 10:47.440
You can just chill,
we can pet the cats.

10:47.606 --> 10:49.650
I love the cats!
They love you.

10:51.110 --> 10:53.529
Oh, I love you so much.
Yeah. I love you, too.

10:53.696 --> 10:54.780
Crazy.

10:58.409 --> 11:01.078
<i>In reference to Target M4937,</i>

11:01.245 --> 11:03.497
<i>you have been
assigned a new identity.</i>

11:04.415 --> 11:08.669
<i>You are FBI Agent Leonard Knox
from the Alabama field office.</i>

11:09.295 --> 11:11.630
<i>New Orleans PD is
at your disposal.</i>

11:12.340 --> 11:16.093
<i>Hopper, because of your personal
relationship with the target,</i>

11:16.177 --> 11:19.180
<i>we remind you that failure
will not be tolerated.</i>

11:19.347 --> 11:22.516
<i>Eliminating the target
is now your top priority.</i>

11:28.856 --> 11:30.024
Knox?

11:30.524 --> 11:33.110
Agent Leonard Knox?
Uh-huh.

11:33.486 --> 11:34.612
And you are?

11:34.695 --> 11:36.113
Detective Gus Patrick.

11:37.114 --> 11:38.532
Welcome to New Orleans.

11:38.699 --> 11:40.076
Nice to meet you.

11:46.457 --> 11:47.792
Is this supposed
to be relaxing?

11:47.958 --> 11:49.627
Well, normally it is.
You just make everything so crazy.

11:49.752 --> 11:51.921
I don't make...
Why are you wearing the cat ears?

11:52.004 --> 11:53.631
They sell them
behind the counter.

11:53.798 --> 11:55.049
Those are for
the little kids.

11:55.132 --> 11:56.467
Well, I feel beautiful.

11:56.801 --> 11:59.470
But you guys are okay, aren't you?
You're just the cutest.

11:59.637 --> 12:02.473
No, that is Hannibal.
He's a straight-up killer.

12:02.640 --> 12:04.767
This one?
Yeah, he'll fucking scratch your face off.

12:04.934 --> 12:06.936
Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?

12:07.812 --> 12:08.979
This is a metaphor.

12:09.146 --> 12:10.856
No.
This cat is my soul.

12:11.023 --> 12:12.983
It's not a metaphor.
I need to confront this.

12:13.150 --> 12:14.819
Martha, no.
We're gonna be best buddies.

12:14.985 --> 12:15.986
I would not stand
that close to the cage.

12:16.153 --> 12:17.446
Martha, what are you doing?
It's gonna be okay.

12:17.613 --> 12:19.253
What are you doing? No.
Hey, little buddy.

12:23.327 --> 12:26.455
So in the metaphor,
do you think I won or lost?

12:27.498 --> 12:29.500
God, it just exploded.

12:29.583 --> 12:31.836
I mean, it pissed
right in your face.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.170
Ugh!

12:33.796 --> 12:35.798
Sorry. You really
took the brunt of it.

12:35.965 --> 12:38.801
I thought you'd have better
reflexes working with cats so long.

12:39.635 --> 12:41.262
Do you think that's
a defense mechanism?

12:41.345 --> 12:43.139
That it pisses
right in your face?

12:43.305 --> 12:44.348
Is that like a...

12:44.640 --> 12:46.809
Evolutionary sort of...

12:47.476 --> 12:49.854
I'm really sorry,
Sophie.

12:50.980 --> 12:53.524
It wasn't a metaphor.
Yeah, I realize that now.

12:53.691 --> 12:54.733
Yeah.

12:57.153 --> 12:58.654
You should go home.

12:59.989 --> 13:01.699
Are you sure?
Yeah.

13:02.324 --> 13:03.868
Yeah, very sure.

13:05.494 --> 13:06.495
Okay.

13:06.871 --> 13:07.997
I will see you at home.

13:08.414 --> 13:09.874
<i>Is it crazy that I
want you to stay</i>

13:09.957 --> 13:12.501
<i>When I tell you to leave
When I tell you go?</i>

13:12.585 --> 13:16.046
<i>Is it crazy that I say your name
more times a day Than I say my own?</i>

13:16.130 --> 13:18.257
<i>Tell me, baby,
Is it crazy?</i>

13:20.968 --> 13:24.472
<i>'Cause I ain't been myself
Lately something's going on</i>

13:24.555 --> 13:28.809
<i>Nah, boy, I ain't even slept
I been up all night long</i>

13:28.893 --> 13:31.312
<i>In my head</i>

13:31.395 --> 13:35.399
<i>Tryin' to figure out What I want,
what I do What I don't</i>

13:35.483 --> 13:37.985
<i>Is it crazy all them
answers is you?</i>

13:39.945 --> 13:43.824
<i>Tell me 'cause
I don't understand</i>

13:43.908 --> 13:47.995
<i>How someone just can
Walk into your life</i>

13:48.078 --> 13:51.165
<i>And everything before them
You forget?</i>

13:51.248 --> 13:53.501
<i>Is it crazy?</i>

13:55.586 --> 13:56.879
How'd you do that?

13:57.254 --> 13:58.589
This is a lot of condoms.

13:59.632 --> 14:01.550
Enough condoms
here to choke a goat.

14:01.717 --> 14:04.220
What?
I don't know what I just said.

14:04.386 --> 14:05.763
Hey, you wanna
get out of here?

14:06.263 --> 14:08.224
What?
Is that creepy?

14:08.390 --> 14:10.601
Sometimes
I don't know I'm being creepy.

14:10.768 --> 14:12.269
Do you wanna go on a date?

14:12.436 --> 14:14.756
I mean, do you wanna get out
of here and then go on a date?

14:15.606 --> 14:16.941
Based on what?

14:17.274 --> 14:19.109
Based on nothing?

14:19.944 --> 14:21.946
Just go on a date?

14:22.112 --> 14:23.781
Well, what else
are you doing today?

14:23.948 --> 14:26.450
Fighting the urge to run
away from you right now.

14:26.617 --> 14:29.119
I'm actually
on the run, too.

14:29.286 --> 14:30.454
From creepy guys like you?

14:30.621 --> 14:33.582
Oh, man, these guys wish
they were as creepy as I am.

14:33.749 --> 14:36.126
International hitmen.

14:37.294 --> 14:38.963
Ugh! Gross, right?

14:39.129 --> 14:41.329
Come on, it's 3:00 p.m.
Let's go get some gumbo.

14:41.465 --> 14:44.134
Alligator pancakes?
What else you got to do today?

14:44.301 --> 14:46.637
Other than get
serial-killed

14:46.720 --> 14:48.472
by a cartoon character?

14:48.556 --> 14:49.640
Maybe a lot.

14:53.143 --> 14:54.743
Was that cartoon
character bothering you?

14:54.812 --> 14:56.146
'Cause I'll kick his ass.

14:56.230 --> 14:57.310
What happened to your hand?

14:57.856 --> 14:59.316
Oh! It was a cat.

15:00.234 --> 15:02.736
I don't own cats, actually.
Like, I'm not like a cat lady.

15:03.070 --> 15:04.989
I mean,
I love cats, but...

15:05.906 --> 15:08.742
...it was a rogue cat.

15:09.326 --> 15:10.578
I think you're beautiful.

15:11.787 --> 15:13.455
I'm more fun than
a barrel of kittens.

15:13.539 --> 15:15.249
Mmm-hmm.
In a good way.

15:15.374 --> 15:17.918
Yeah.
Let's ditch this Popsicle stand.

15:18.002 --> 15:21.130
Let's go for it. Let's go on a date.
Let's go out, you and me.

15:22.006 --> 15:25.009
Explain to me in two words
why I should hang with you.

15:25.718 --> 15:27.011
Two words?

15:27.553 --> 15:28.679
Um...

15:31.265 --> 15:33.309
"Or else."

15:35.853 --> 15:38.230
Wow, that's actually
really fucking creepy.

15:38.355 --> 15:39.675
That's really creepy, right?
Yeah.

15:39.732 --> 15:40.774
Come on.

15:40.941 --> 15:42.026
You gonna pay for those?

15:42.484 --> 15:44.612
- Um, I did. Didn't I pay for these already?
- No.

15:44.695 --> 15:47.031
Oh, I didn't.
I'm so sorry. So sorry.

15:47.114 --> 15:48.699
You caught me.

15:49.867 --> 15:51.702
Hey, buddy. What...
Mmm-hmm?

15:51.785 --> 15:55.122
You can't just attack it
from the bottom willy-nilly.

15:55.205 --> 15:57.166
You were doing fine before.
Just eat it like a...

15:57.249 --> 16:00.127
...you know,
like a normal human man.

16:00.252 --> 16:02.132
- Are you...
- What are you, the hot dog police?

16:02.171 --> 16:03.172
Are you new to eating?

16:03.839 --> 16:06.050
I love that shirt.
Oh, really?

16:06.133 --> 16:08.969
Yeah, it's confident.
You've got like a confidence thing.

16:09.219 --> 16:10.846
I have a confidence thing?

16:11.013 --> 16:13.724
Yeah, like "fuck everybody."
You know what I mean?

16:13.891 --> 16:16.143
Excuse me, ladies. Don't you think
she has like a confidence thing?

16:16.226 --> 16:17.986
Sorry. He's a crazy person.
I don't know him.

16:18.020 --> 16:19.146
But you do.

16:19.229 --> 16:21.065
It's funny, though,
'cause this was an ordeal.

16:21.148 --> 16:22.358
You know, it's like
every time I get dressed,

16:22.441 --> 16:24.652
I have to confront, like,
what does this say about me?

16:24.735 --> 16:28.989
'Cause I have stuff going
on in here and in here.

16:29.156 --> 16:31.492
And I need my shirt to
be a reflection of that.

16:31.659 --> 16:33.661
That's a lot of
responsibility for a shirt.

16:34.495 --> 16:38.415
Yeah. Well, I probably don't need
to tackle the meaning of life

16:38.582 --> 16:40.262
every time I make
a decision about clothes.

16:40.334 --> 16:42.378
I actually relate to that.
Oh, yeah?

16:42.544 --> 16:44.544
Yeah. It takes me, like,
half an hour every morning

16:44.588 --> 16:46.173
just to decide
what to wear.

16:46.256 --> 16:50.094
Oh, 'cause I thought this was a
terrible, terrible accident.

16:50.177 --> 16:51.512
No, this was
a conscious decision.

16:51.595 --> 16:53.180
I'm completely
fucking bananas.

16:55.432 --> 16:56.558
You're funny.

16:56.642 --> 16:58.602
Mmm...

17:04.023 --> 17:06.859
You didn't finish your
story about the museum dig thing.

17:07.027 --> 17:09.445
Oh, yeah,
well, it never happened.

17:09.613 --> 17:13.617
I met Jeff and it was sort of about
him and his dreams and his goals.

17:13.784 --> 17:15.368
And he's a professor, so...

17:15.536 --> 17:18.288
Well, I guess I'm supposed to be,
too, if I honor my degree.

17:18.454 --> 17:19.455
How'd he die?

17:20.207 --> 17:21.290
He's...

17:21.625 --> 17:24.377
No,
he's alive, he's fine.

17:24.545 --> 17:26.130
He's just an asshole.

17:26.380 --> 17:27.798
Well, I mean,
he wasn't at first,

17:27.881 --> 17:29.717
but then he sort of
<i>Scooby-Doo-</i> style...

17:30.300 --> 17:31.385
...you know,
unmasked himself.

17:31.468 --> 17:33.804
Oh, secret asshole. Yeah.
Yes. The worst.

17:34.304 --> 17:35.723
I think it's my
selection process.

17:35.889 --> 17:38.100
Just every guy I get
attached to, you know,

17:38.183 --> 17:39.727
turns out to be
secretly like...

17:40.728 --> 17:42.563
Yeah. Am I in trouble?

17:42.730 --> 17:44.648
Like, am I gonna
get Asshole Syndrome?

17:44.815 --> 17:46.442
Oh, no, but it's not
a secret you're an asshole.

17:46.525 --> 17:47.985
Oh, well, then we're fine.

17:48.193 --> 17:50.362
I think the guy thing's
just a symptom, though.

17:50.529 --> 17:53.407
I think I don't know
what I'm doing generally.

17:53.490 --> 17:54.616
You know.
Mmm.

17:54.700 --> 17:58.454
If you know that,
why don't you change it?

17:59.538 --> 18:03.542
Well...
Is a question only dickheads ask?

18:03.625 --> 18:05.377
Sorry.

18:06.211 --> 18:07.546
<i>Yeah, dragons.</i>

18:07.880 --> 18:09.882
You know, 'cause humans just
wanna put a name on something

18:09.965 --> 18:11.258
to make it feel
safe, but really,

18:11.341 --> 18:13.552
what is a dinosaur
other than a dragon?

18:13.635 --> 18:16.388
Sorry, I feel like I've been
talking about paleontology a lot.

18:16.555 --> 18:18.140
I don't know
anything about you.

18:18.307 --> 18:19.308
Really?
Yeah.

18:19.475 --> 18:21.268
Well, that's too bad,

18:21.351 --> 18:23.395
because I'm a fascinating
and complex person.

18:23.562 --> 18:24.897
Is that right?
Yeah, kinda sorta.

18:25.063 --> 18:26.648
What do you do?
I travel a lot.

18:26.815 --> 18:29.985
And I buy used cars,
old cars, vintage cars.

18:30.152 --> 18:31.904
I travel,
looking for cars.

18:32.070 --> 18:33.750
And I kill people,
but not so much anymore.

18:33.864 --> 18:35.073
Oh, you split the time?

18:37.201 --> 18:38.827
Fuck!
Hey, you okay?

18:39.703 --> 18:40.913
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

18:49.004 --> 18:50.172
What was that?

18:50.339 --> 18:51.924
Goddamn it!

18:52.007 --> 18:54.009
Just some poopyhead
trying to kill me.

18:54.927 --> 18:55.928
You wanna shake him?
Yeah.

18:56.094 --> 18:57.137
Maybe he's trying
to kill you.

18:57.221 --> 18:58.821
Is there something
you're not telling me?

19:55.445 --> 19:57.030
See,
I think my problem is that

19:57.114 --> 19:59.825
I have to be the best ever
at everything that I do.

19:59.908 --> 20:01.743
Like if I'm
picking out a suit,

20:01.869 --> 20:04.621
or I'm waterboarding a terrorist.
Sure.

20:04.788 --> 20:07.082
Or I'm doing a soufflÃ© or
being someone's boyfriend,

20:07.165 --> 20:08.959
I have to be
the best ever at it.

20:09.209 --> 20:10.377
I think I'm just trying to

20:10.460 --> 20:13.130
take life more seriously these days.
What's so funny?

20:14.214 --> 20:16.884
You're just the corniest
person I've ever met.

20:17.217 --> 20:18.468
I am.

20:18.802 --> 20:20.304
Shuck me.
But number one.

20:20.470 --> 20:22.431
Number one.
Number one.

20:24.141 --> 20:26.643
Um... So then like...

20:26.727 --> 20:29.229
Philosophically,
you're opposed to casual sex, 'cause...

20:29.396 --> 20:32.196
Well, I usually do it naked. I don't
know what's more casual than that.

20:32.316 --> 20:34.484
I once dated a girl,
we had formal sex.

20:34.651 --> 20:36.153
I had to wear a tuxedo.
Sure.

20:36.320 --> 20:39.156
It got really sweaty.
The bowtie got all crooked.

20:39.323 --> 20:40.741
That's so stupid.

20:40.908 --> 20:44.077
It's really stupid.
I'm here every Tuesday.

20:44.494 --> 20:46.788
Try the veal.

20:47.664 --> 20:49.499
This is cute.

20:49.583 --> 20:51.919
You like that?
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

20:53.503 --> 20:55.505
Hello.
Hey. Hello.

20:55.672 --> 20:57.007
How are you?

20:57.507 --> 21:01.219
You're really pretty.

21:01.345 --> 21:03.847
That was dumb. Corny.

21:04.514 --> 21:06.350
Yeah. You're the worst.

21:16.360 --> 21:17.778
Oh, my God.

21:19.279 --> 21:20.948
Put that down.

21:25.744 --> 21:27.955
Oh! Hello.

21:28.038 --> 21:29.665
Hmm.
Oh-oh.

21:29.957 --> 21:30.958
Hi.

21:31.124 --> 21:33.126
Hi.
Hey, Sophie.

21:33.293 --> 21:35.379
Hey.
Have we met before?

21:35.545 --> 21:38.632
No. I'm the crazy guy that
Martha met at the supermarket.

21:38.799 --> 21:41.718
Now I know where you live.
Hey! Whoa!

21:41.885 --> 21:43.470
Oh. Awesome.

21:45.138 --> 21:47.975
Wow, you look great.
You really do like dragons, huh?

21:48.141 --> 21:49.810
And bonus tigers.

21:49.977 --> 21:51.697
Why don't you park those
dragons right here?

21:54.564 --> 21:59.319
So, I should let you know I still feel,
like, a little messed up over the...

22:00.404 --> 22:03.657
...um, the other thing,
the previous thing, you know.

22:03.824 --> 22:06.034
<i>Scooby-Doo?</i>
Yeah.

22:06.910 --> 22:09.997
So, um, I still want you to stay,
if you wanna stay, though.

22:11.748 --> 22:13.250
Well...

22:15.711 --> 22:18.088
Yeah! Hang out
until infinity!

22:18.171 --> 22:19.548
Yay! I'm down!

22:19.715 --> 22:22.592
Jumping on a bed! Yay!

22:23.510 --> 22:24.594
Sorry.

22:25.178 --> 22:28.890
If I'm being jumpy, I'm just a
little nervous. I think I like you.

22:36.732 --> 22:39.359
You don't think
that this is too much, do you?

22:39.568 --> 22:40.736
Nah.

22:41.570 --> 22:43.071
I still think we
should've cut his head off,

22:43.155 --> 22:44.635
though, you know?
Turns up the volume.

22:45.073 --> 22:47.409
Johnny Moon,
you sick fuck.

22:47.576 --> 22:49.161
This is the
beginning of a new era.

22:49.327 --> 22:51.747
Once we are back in Jersey,
we're gonna be in charge.

22:51.913 --> 22:54.913
We're not gonna be stuck down here in
this fucking armpit of a fucking city.

22:55.167 --> 22:57.586
No offense, I know you grew up here.
No offense taken.

22:57.753 --> 23:00.756
I like you. I mean, you're not a
smart guy and you're not a tough guy

23:00.922 --> 23:02.966
but you make big calls
and you got big balls.

23:03.133 --> 23:05.761
I mean, getting Clown Nose to
kill Richie so you can take over?

23:05.927 --> 23:09.347
Wow. This is a terrible
fucking plan, but...

23:09.514 --> 23:11.767
I believe in it.
It's gonna be fun.

23:13.101 --> 23:15.020
Hey, check it out.

23:15.187 --> 23:17.481
Houdini here is still alive.

23:17.773 --> 23:19.066
Hey, Paco!

23:19.608 --> 23:21.193
You having
a rough night, buddy?

23:21.318 --> 23:23.445
What?

23:23.612 --> 23:25.238
All right.

23:25.322 --> 23:26.865
Okay,
let's get him up. Ready?

23:30.118 --> 23:31.953
All right, you ready?
Yeah.

23:32.120 --> 23:33.747
One, two, three.

24:12.327 --> 24:14.329
- That's him?
- Yeah.

24:14.412 --> 24:15.705
I like it.
I like it a lot.

24:16.248 --> 24:17.666
How long you said
you've been tracking him?

24:17.833 --> 24:21.002
FBI's been on him
for 10 years.

24:21.753 --> 24:23.421
The CIA for 15.

24:23.588 --> 24:25.590
I've been
running point for five.

24:25.966 --> 24:27.606
Why don't we just
grab him right now?

24:27.759 --> 24:30.079
With a task force, lock up the
street with snipers and SWAT.

24:30.137 --> 24:32.264
You really want to
clean up that many bodies?

24:35.600 --> 24:38.019
Yeah!

24:38.520 --> 24:39.521
I'm in love.

24:48.155 --> 24:49.906
- Are you kidding me right now?
- What?

24:50.073 --> 24:51.575
I used to make breakfast
for you all the time.

24:51.741 --> 24:53.118
Yeah, in a microwave.

24:54.077 --> 24:56.830
That guy last night,
he seemed really, like...

24:57.247 --> 24:58.832
Fancy homeless.

24:58.999 --> 25:01.334
Oh, my God.
I just realized I don't know his name.

25:01.501 --> 25:02.586
Who, Mr. Right?

25:02.752 --> 25:04.796
Yeah, we were together for like 10 hours.
It never came up.

25:04.963 --> 25:06.214
You slept with him
and you don't know his name?

25:06.298 --> 25:07.674
I did not sleep with him.

25:07.841 --> 25:11.261
Okay, we slept together.
We didn't have sex.

25:11.428 --> 25:13.430
We cuddled.
It was adorable.

25:13.597 --> 25:15.599
Okay.
I don't need a name for that.

25:15.765 --> 25:17.893
But still, I mean,
he didn't tell you his name.

25:17.976 --> 25:19.186
Martha, at some point,
you're gonna just have to

25:19.269 --> 25:20.645
start recognizing
these red flags.

25:20.812 --> 25:22.105
Why? Do you think
he's evil?

25:22.772 --> 25:24.232
What if he is?

25:24.316 --> 25:25.396
You know,
when I was little,

25:25.442 --> 25:27.027
I had this fantasy that
I was dating Lex Luthor.

25:27.110 --> 25:30.113
From <i>Superman?</i>
Wasn't he like a genius?

25:30.197 --> 25:32.490
Your guy is more like a
sexy Rain Man or something.

25:32.657 --> 25:33.783
Thank you.
But you know what?

25:33.867 --> 25:35.577
I don't really
think this is about him.

25:35.660 --> 25:37.579
I think you're just
in an unstable time

25:37.662 --> 25:40.457
and maybe you're just
latching onto this guy

25:40.540 --> 25:42.834
because, you know,
the first guy you meet...

25:42.918 --> 25:44.794
Mmm. Yeah, I think I'm in love with him.
Is that stupid?

25:44.878 --> 25:46.713
Yes. Hard yes.

25:46.796 --> 25:48.715
What is that?
I want support.

25:48.798 --> 25:50.638
I just made you a pancake.
You have to be nice.

25:50.675 --> 25:52.719
You're saying
batshit crazy things.

25:52.802 --> 25:55.138
I think you may be having, like,
an early mid-life crisis, okay?

25:55.222 --> 25:56.302
That doesn't sound like me.

25:57.098 --> 25:58.350
Mmm!

25:58.808 --> 26:01.311
Pretty good.
He just makes me feel...

26:02.646 --> 26:04.814
I don't know,
like you said, Mr. Right.

26:04.981 --> 26:06.066
Oh, my God.

26:06.233 --> 26:07.984
Can you fry whip cream?

26:08.151 --> 26:09.486
Why not?

26:09.653 --> 26:10.904
Oh! What?

26:16.284 --> 26:17.702
<i>How come
you're still alive?</i>

26:17.786 --> 26:18.954
What are you doing, Hopper?

26:19.287 --> 26:20.914
<i>The company says
you stopped checking in.</i>

26:20.997 --> 26:22.290
<i>What's your big plan?</i>

26:22.707 --> 26:24.000
<i>Well, I'm bringing him in.</i>

26:24.292 --> 26:26.753
What the hell?
He killed my whole fucking team!

26:27.170 --> 26:29.339
He's mine,
and I'm taking him out.

26:29.506 --> 26:31.007
Oh, really?
You have a better idea?

26:31.174 --> 26:32.592
Always. Literally, always.

26:32.676 --> 26:34.511
I will always have
a better idea than you.

26:35.512 --> 26:37.931
I know this guy.
I know his weak spot.

26:38.098 --> 26:39.516
<i>I trained him.</i>

26:39.599 --> 26:41.559
<i>So for now, we wait.</i>

26:41.810 --> 26:44.229
Mmm! Yeah,
like pussies, huh?

26:44.396 --> 26:46.356
Yeah, okay. Like pussies.

26:46.523 --> 26:49.025
We're in a big
pussy parade.

26:49.192 --> 26:50.235
Hey!

26:50.402 --> 26:51.842
I'm not in a pussy parade,
all right?

26:51.987 --> 26:54.030
<i>You watch your
fucking mouth, Hopper.</i>

26:55.156 --> 26:56.199
It's the wife.

26:56.366 --> 26:57.534
I know what you mean.

26:59.202 --> 27:01.538
So what's the story on Hopper?
Who?

27:01.705 --> 27:03.999
Ed Hopper. His name keeps
coming up in the files.

27:04.165 --> 27:06.167
He used to work
with our boy, right?

27:06.334 --> 27:08.670
Some sort of master of disguise,
secret agent-type dude.

27:08.837 --> 27:10.088
I mean, I didn't read
the whole thing, but...

27:10.171 --> 27:11.631
Well, of course you didn't,
but if you had,

27:11.715 --> 27:14.718
you'd know that Hopper's been
missing almost 12 years now.

27:15.343 --> 27:18.221
They worked together in the
Ultra program at the CIA

27:18.388 --> 27:20.390
but that went down in flames,
end of story.

27:20.890 --> 27:22.225
Forget Hopper.

27:22.392 --> 27:24.728
Let's focus on one
psycho at a time.

27:26.187 --> 27:27.355
All right.

27:46.374 --> 27:47.751
Hey, Monster.

27:52.088 --> 27:54.049
Did you just call me "Monster"?
Yeah, it's like a nickname.

27:54.215 --> 27:56.259
Like Marth, Marthster,
Monster, that sort of thing.

27:56.426 --> 27:57.427
Yeah, into it.

27:57.594 --> 27:59.471
Worth noting that nicknames
are supposed to happen, like,

27:59.554 --> 28:01.139
organically over time,
but...

28:01.222 --> 28:03.382
Okay. I can say it like a
thousand times in 10 minutes.

28:03.433 --> 28:08.605
Monster, Monster, Monster,
Monster, Monster, Monster.

28:08.772 --> 28:10.273
Yeah, just
Stockholm syndrome me.

28:10.440 --> 28:11.733
I love that album.

28:11.900 --> 28:14.235
It's better than Agatha.
Who's Agatha?

28:14.694 --> 28:16.696
Oh! I think Agatha is
a swell middle name.

28:16.780 --> 28:20.784
It is "swell." It is swell
'cause it's basically from 1935.

28:20.950 --> 28:26.122
And Martha Agatha, it's just a double
menopause punch in the... Ugh!

28:26.623 --> 28:28.124
It's brutal.

28:28.416 --> 28:30.293
Hey, you wanna do
like a role-play thing?

28:30.752 --> 28:32.796
Where I'm an old lady?

28:32.962 --> 28:35.562
Yeah, I could get into that.
We could get, like, a walker, a cane.

28:36.633 --> 28:39.803
Actually, I mean,
it's my, sort of, dream

28:39.969 --> 28:43.431
to eventually be the old lady
in the neighborhood that's like

28:43.598 --> 28:47.102
the crazy old lady,
like crazy old Martha

28:47.268 --> 28:51.481
and just have, like, messy white
hair and, like, ratty clothes

28:51.648 --> 28:54.484
and I just drive around all
day dead-eyeing teenagers.

28:54.651 --> 28:57.654
That's awesome.
It's like...

28:57.946 --> 28:59.656
It's my dream.

28:59.823 --> 29:01.658
I can't wait to
be there for that.

29:03.118 --> 29:04.452
Hey, are you hungry?

29:04.869 --> 29:06.663
Excuse me, waiter? Can I...

29:14.379 --> 29:16.506
I'm sorry, I have to just
go outside for a second.

29:16.673 --> 29:17.799
I'm really sorry.

29:25.140 --> 29:26.850
<i>Hey, buddy,
here's the thing.</i>

29:27.142 --> 29:29.519
I'm on a date,
and I like this girl.

29:29.686 --> 29:30.979
Can't we do this tomorrow?

29:31.146 --> 29:32.856
I'd kill you in a park,
I'd kill you at the beach.

29:33.022 --> 29:35.358
Maybe rent a nice, cozy hotel room?
I'd kill you there.

29:35.525 --> 29:38.194
We'll get a big fruit plate,
hang out, we could hold hands.

29:38.361 --> 29:39.696
Fuck you, bitch.

29:51.082 --> 29:52.208
Are we done?

29:52.667 --> 29:54.502
Where the fuck
you going, pussy?

29:54.669 --> 29:56.379
I'm gonna kill you
and your fucking bitch.

29:56.546 --> 29:57.714
You heard me.

29:58.006 --> 29:59.007
What?

29:59.174 --> 30:01.134
You fucking heard me.
Come get some.

30:01.217 --> 30:03.219
Why'd you have to
go and threaten her?

30:03.553 --> 30:05.513
That's not a nice thing
to say.

30:08.683 --> 30:10.810
All right, gimme a second.

30:10.894 --> 30:12.187
Yeah, come on, princess.

30:12.270 --> 30:13.670
Let me know when
you're comfortable.

30:34.375 --> 30:35.752
Let's go, bitch!

30:37.921 --> 30:39.255
Fuck!
Hurts, don't it?

30:51.142 --> 30:52.143
Whoa!

30:53.061 --> 30:54.229
Okay.

30:54.604 --> 30:55.980
Fucking guys.

30:56.439 --> 30:58.149
That guy's really
homophobic.

30:58.316 --> 30:59.442
Get the fuck off me!

31:06.783 --> 31:08.117
All right,
have you had enough?

31:08.201 --> 31:09.452
You could've
gotten blood on me.

31:09.744 --> 31:11.788
This is a nice girl.

31:14.290 --> 31:16.584
I'm just...

31:17.085 --> 31:18.753
I want it to go well.

31:19.295 --> 31:20.797
I like this girl.

31:26.135 --> 31:27.971
Hey, did you have to
finish a book on tape?

31:28.137 --> 31:30.807
No, sorry.
I had to kill somebody in the parking lot.

31:30.974 --> 31:33.476
Some asshole.
Yeah, he was a real dickhead.

31:33.977 --> 31:35.770
Hey, you mind if I come around
to your side of the table?

31:35.937 --> 31:37.605
Oh, yeah. Sure.

31:37.772 --> 31:39.315
Yep. Okay. I love it.

31:39.482 --> 31:42.986
Let's fly in the face of
traditional face-to-face dining.

31:43.152 --> 31:45.822
Yeah. There's too much
real estate between us.

31:45.989 --> 31:47.657
Anarchy.
I'm starving.

31:47.824 --> 31:49.534
I know. After killing that guy,
you must be exhausted.

31:49.617 --> 31:50.827
Right?

31:50.994 --> 31:52.328
Let's get some food.
Okay.

31:55.331 --> 31:56.833
I don't understand.

31:58.501 --> 32:01.170
Why would anybody
kill Paco?

32:01.337 --> 32:02.839
And dump his
body under a bridge?

32:03.006 --> 32:05.008
Well, to get at us, Richie.

32:05.091 --> 32:07.176
I mean, they're trying
to suss us out.

32:07.677 --> 32:11.723
I think that it is this local big dick,
Hector Garcia.

32:11.889 --> 32:13.182
Paco must have talked.

32:13.349 --> 32:15.143
I mean, he probably
let it slip that

32:15.226 --> 32:18.688
he was helping to hide out big-money,
up north scaries.

32:19.147 --> 32:20.315
Fuck.

32:23.401 --> 32:26.195
We have to tell Dad. What?
No, we don't have to tell Dad shit.

32:26.362 --> 32:29.741
They're still cleaning blood off
the walls back at home, Von.

32:29.907 --> 32:32.410
And might I remind you that
this was your fucking mess?

32:37.874 --> 32:39.167
I apologize.

32:41.544 --> 32:43.671
Yeah.
I got an idea.

32:44.380 --> 32:45.715
There's word on a guy.

32:45.882 --> 32:48.384
Big-time hitman that
wears a clown nose.

32:48.551 --> 32:50.345
Maybe he takes care
of the job for us.

32:50.511 --> 32:52.513
Yeah. This, I like this.

32:52.680 --> 32:53.760
Yeah, he makes a statement.

32:53.890 --> 32:55.224
No, no.
I'm not hiring some

32:55.308 --> 32:57.352
straight-off-the-boat asshole
to fix our problems.

32:57.518 --> 32:58.718
We're supposed
to be lying low.

32:58.853 --> 33:01.564
That's great, that's great.
That's a much better fucking plan.

33:01.731 --> 33:04.192
We'll just stay locked up like
a bunch of fucking rats

33:04.359 --> 33:06.903
waiting for the FBI
to knock on our fucking door!

33:07.236 --> 33:10.907
Oh, that's great, Richie. Eight years
of therapy is working out beautifully.

33:11.074 --> 33:13.874
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten. I apologize.

33:18.790 --> 33:20.917
I like what Johnny's
saying because this guy,

33:21.000 --> 33:22.752
he's like a real
international contractor.

33:22.919 --> 33:26.255
I mean, he's this Bruce Lee,
James Bond-type of bad-ass motherfucker.

33:26.422 --> 33:29.258
We get him to
make a move on Garcia

33:29.425 --> 33:32.220
and we stop this shit
before it starts.

33:36.474 --> 33:37.892
Okay.

33:38.226 --> 33:39.268
Okay.

33:39.894 --> 33:43.606
Go, uh,
find your professional.

33:45.233 --> 33:46.442
I'll meet with him.

33:47.068 --> 33:48.111
Okay?

33:58.788 --> 34:00.248
Here you go.
Thank you.

34:01.290 --> 34:02.542
Where's Sophie?

34:02.625 --> 34:06.045
Uh, she's with a guy who doesn't
wanna be in a relationship,

34:06.129 --> 34:07.797
so it's a real treat
for her.

34:07.880 --> 34:08.880
Ah.

34:12.092 --> 34:14.137
What's your name?
My name?

34:14.469 --> 34:16.472
Yeah, I realized...

34:17.431 --> 34:18.808
I was kinda having fun
not knowing,

34:18.891 --> 34:21.936
but now I think it's
more weird than adorable.

34:22.103 --> 34:24.647
Is it hot in here? Um...
I don't really like my name.

34:24.813 --> 34:26.149
I just kinda...

34:26.315 --> 34:28.484
I kinda hate it and
it makes me angry.

34:28.650 --> 34:30.777
And I've been really honest
with you about everything.

34:30.945 --> 34:32.405
And I know it's only
been a couple of days,

34:32.487 --> 34:34.408
and that's not a big
accomplishment or something,

34:34.489 --> 34:37.290
but I just don't like my name and I
don't wanna tell you. Is that okay?

34:37.326 --> 34:38.453
Okay.

34:38.619 --> 34:40.955
Weirdo.

34:41.581 --> 34:42.831
Um...

34:43.498 --> 34:45.293
How'd you do that thing
in the store?

34:45.501 --> 34:46.627
What thing?

34:47.462 --> 34:49.505
You know, the, like...

34:50.005 --> 34:52.341
The way you move sometimes.
It's like...

34:53.009 --> 34:55.011
It's like you know, um...

34:55.178 --> 34:57.972
Oh, yeah, that thing.
Right. Yeah.

34:59.182 --> 35:00.516
You wanna see a trick?

35:01.517 --> 35:02.560
Okay.

35:08.191 --> 35:09.984
Is this gonna get,
like, scary?

35:10.151 --> 35:11.819
Uh, no scarier than usual,
I don't think.

35:11.986 --> 35:13.529
There aren't usually
knives.

35:13.696 --> 35:15.031
Well, first time
for everything.

35:16.491 --> 35:20.203
Um... Ever since
I was a little boy,

35:20.703 --> 35:22.538
I've had an idea.

35:22.705 --> 35:25.374
It's more of a theory,
really.

35:31.714 --> 35:34.008
Keep up.
I'm trying.

35:34.550 --> 35:38.554
Everything we see, like physical
things, it's all just islands.

35:38.721 --> 35:42.850
And under it, carrying it,
is this sweeping current.

35:43.017 --> 35:44.310
And if you pay attention,

35:44.644 --> 35:46.354
you can start to feel it.

35:50.566 --> 35:51.859
Yeah.

35:53.861 --> 35:58.866
You see how your hand
moves with mine?

35:59.033 --> 36:00.535
You can feel it. Right?

36:05.248 --> 36:08.042
That's okay,
just concentrate on the knife.

36:11.879 --> 36:14.549
Now if we can
feel the current,

36:14.715 --> 36:18.261
we can feel other things
in the current.

36:18.719 --> 36:19.762
People.

36:19.929 --> 36:21.264
Watch the knife.

36:22.056 --> 36:25.893
And we can feel how the
current will move them.

36:26.060 --> 36:28.563
And we can see
where they'll go.

36:28.729 --> 36:30.773
It's all in the movement,
you see, it pushes itself.

36:30.940 --> 36:33.985
It's easier to move
with it than against it.

36:45.288 --> 36:47.123
Jesus Christ!
What? What?

36:47.290 --> 36:49.250
Why the fuck
would you do that?

36:49.417 --> 36:51.252
I thought you were
gonna catch it.

36:51.419 --> 36:53.588
Catch it? Did you not see
where it was gonna go?

36:53.754 --> 36:55.798
I can't catch a knife.
Sure you can.

36:55.965 --> 36:57.800
No, I can't.
Yes, you can.

36:57.967 --> 37:00.761
Remember last night
when we were dancing?

37:00.928 --> 37:03.014
You have an energy.
You've got a knack for this.

37:03.180 --> 37:05.433
Shit. This is crazy.

37:05.600 --> 37:07.977
Oh, my God. Look, I...

37:08.144 --> 37:11.606
I had a really nice
night or whatever.

37:11.772 --> 37:12.982
I know you can
feel it, Martha.

37:13.149 --> 37:14.692
You don't know how yet,
but I can keep showing you.

37:14.859 --> 37:16.152
No, no, no.

37:16.319 --> 37:18.029
You need to leave
right now.

37:19.614 --> 37:22.158
You can feel it. It doesn't
matter what I feel!

37:22.325 --> 37:23.326
Martha.

37:24.994 --> 37:26.287
Yeah.

37:29.123 --> 37:30.458
Cool, right?

37:30.625 --> 37:32.960
That's so gnarly.

37:36.839 --> 37:39.300
No, no more.

37:39.467 --> 37:41.677
No more, no more.
I get it. It's okay.

37:41.844 --> 37:43.846
I should be so freaked out.

37:44.013 --> 37:46.133
- Why don't you give me one of those back?
- Okay.

37:47.683 --> 37:48.851
Yeah.

38:06.702 --> 38:07.870
Yeah, baby.

38:10.873 --> 38:12.166
So...

38:12.875 --> 38:14.502
It's like a pulse?

38:14.710 --> 38:17.546
Yeah, kinda. I never tried to
explain it to anybody before.

38:17.713 --> 38:19.048
No?
Yeah.

38:19.215 --> 38:22.009
You never talked to
anybody about it? No.

38:23.052 --> 38:24.053
Why me?

38:24.679 --> 38:25.972
Because I wanted you
to know.

38:26.055 --> 38:28.182
I needed you to know.
You have a...

38:28.391 --> 38:31.060
A grace. I just knew
you'd understand.

38:31.227 --> 38:33.187
And that's how you
knew I'd catch a knife?

38:33.354 --> 38:34.754
I didn't know
you'd catch the knife.

38:35.064 --> 38:37.566
I believed you
could catch the knife.

38:37.733 --> 38:39.068
I wanted you to
catch the knife.

38:39.151 --> 38:40.528
But there was no
way that I could know.

38:40.695 --> 38:43.197
You're the one who did it.
You're the one who knew.

38:44.615 --> 38:45.783
Are you mad?

38:47.076 --> 38:48.327
No.

38:48.411 --> 38:49.912
No, I'm not mad.

38:51.247 --> 38:54.333
I think I'm crazy.

38:54.417 --> 38:55.876
Me too.

38:56.210 --> 38:59.880
And also, I want you.

39:00.089 --> 39:01.924
I mean, really.

39:02.425 --> 39:03.718
I really do.

39:04.552 --> 39:06.095
I think that's doable.

39:06.262 --> 39:08.055
Shut up. I mean,
immediately.

39:49.638 --> 39:51.182
Huh.

39:56.979 --> 39:57.980
Hi.

39:58.481 --> 40:00.983
You come here often?
Oh, you didn't like my breakfast?

40:01.150 --> 40:02.985
You know, I gotta do
this five-second stop,

40:03.069 --> 40:05.321
and then maybe we could
get a little something.

40:05.488 --> 40:06.489
Okay.
Yeah?

40:06.655 --> 40:08.240
Cool.
Okay.

40:21.170 --> 40:23.839
It's weird. I feel like I've
been in a coma with you.

40:24.006 --> 40:25.633
Like, I don't remember...

40:26.133 --> 40:29.303
...what my life was like
before three days ago.

40:29.470 --> 40:30.471
Yeah.

40:30.638 --> 40:31.639
Me, too.

40:31.806 --> 40:34.183
So, when we were
in bed last night...

40:34.350 --> 40:36.352
Oh, no, it's fine.
I smelled it.

40:36.519 --> 40:39.021
I know, gumbo, hot dogs, I get it.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

40:39.188 --> 40:40.523
You're such an idiot.

40:40.689 --> 40:42.399
No... It doesn't bother me.
It's fine.

40:42.566 --> 40:43.692
I...

40:44.693 --> 40:46.195
...saw your, um...

40:46.362 --> 40:49.490
The scar on your back.
Oh! Yeah.

40:49.698 --> 40:50.825
Um...

40:50.908 --> 40:52.326
Well...

40:53.160 --> 40:56.038
Ah... It's a long story.
I was in Serbia

40:56.205 --> 40:58.374
chasing this guy
all over the tundra...

40:58.541 --> 40:59.667
And, um...

40:59.834 --> 41:02.670
The whole area's
a war zone, and I...

41:03.212 --> 41:06.173
I finally find the guy,
and he's already dead.

41:06.340 --> 41:09.885
This is when I used to work for a
corporation. The CIA, et cetera.

41:10.052 --> 41:11.345
Yeah.
Anyway.

41:11.512 --> 41:14.723
A piece of ceiling tile missed
my heart by about two inches.

41:14.890 --> 41:17.393
Some rubble hit my back,
that's what the scar is from.

41:17.560 --> 41:20.146
It hit me in the head,
and they said I had brain damage.

41:20.229 --> 41:22.314
Blah-blah-blah.
Doctors.

41:23.566 --> 41:26.610
And an old friend
of mine turned on me,

41:26.694 --> 41:28.054
that's why he blew
up the building.

41:28.195 --> 41:29.864
Pretty shitty, actually.

41:30.030 --> 41:33.033
Anyway, I think it put
everything into perspective.

41:33.200 --> 41:36.203
Maybe the brain damage
helped. I don't know.

41:36.370 --> 41:38.247
Hey, there's my guy.
I'll be right back.

41:38.330 --> 41:39.650
I'll finish
the rest of the story.

41:39.707 --> 41:41.625
Okay.
Okay? You look great.

41:54.889 --> 41:55.931
Hey.

41:58.058 --> 41:59.101
You the guy?

42:01.270 --> 42:03.606
I'm a guy, sure. Yeah.

42:04.231 --> 42:05.441
Everything's in there.

42:06.609 --> 42:07.902
Nice.

42:08.402 --> 42:10.946
Who's that guy?
Where the fuck is Richie?

42:11.906 --> 42:13.741
Who hired you?

42:14.617 --> 42:17.119
That's none of your business.
Oh! Yeah.

42:17.286 --> 42:18.621
Well, it's kinda
my business.

42:18.787 --> 42:20.289
<i>What do you mean
Richie's not there?</i>

42:20.372 --> 42:22.499
<i>Fucking Clown Nose is
supposed to kill him!</i>

42:32.134 --> 42:33.636
Let me see
what you got here.

42:34.803 --> 42:36.305
Hector Garcia?

42:36.430 --> 42:38.910
Look at this guy. He looks like Serpico.
What're you doing, man?

42:38.974 --> 42:40.434
You want me to kill
Hector Garcia?

42:40.517 --> 42:42.186
That's a bit ambitious,
don't you think?

42:42.353 --> 42:44.063
Come on, you won't
tell me who hired you

42:44.146 --> 42:46.315
to hire me to
kill Hector Garcia?

42:47.608 --> 42:49.443
Fuck you, psycho.
Psycho?

42:49.610 --> 42:51.891
Yeah, get the fuck out of here
before this shit gets ugly.

42:51.987 --> 42:54.114
You're lucky I don't
pop your ass right here.

42:54.281 --> 42:55.491
You like clowns?

43:10.965 --> 43:14.301
Shit, he just fucking killed the guy.
The wrong guy.

43:18.138 --> 43:19.306
Sorry.

43:19.890 --> 43:22.309
That took a little
longer than I thought.

43:23.185 --> 43:25.813
What's... Are you okay?

43:26.313 --> 43:27.523
What's...

43:29.191 --> 43:32.194
Are you upset because
I killed that guy?

43:32.653 --> 43:34.488
Martha, how I feel
about that guy

43:34.571 --> 43:36.490
has nothing to do with
how I feel about you.

43:38.492 --> 43:39.827
Are you...

43:39.994 --> 43:41.829
Um, can I go home, please?

43:49.837 --> 43:51.213
Fudge.

44:02.558 --> 44:04.226
Jeez, look at that.

44:04.310 --> 44:05.644
Mmm-hmm.

44:05.728 --> 44:07.730
There's little blood spatters
all over the place.

44:07.896 --> 44:11.859
I mean, the angle and the velocity
is all weird, though. Like he's...

44:12.026 --> 44:13.235
Spinning.

44:13.569 --> 44:14.737
Dancing.

44:15.446 --> 44:16.447
Huh?

44:18.240 --> 44:20.367
He wasn't spinning.
He was dancing.

44:23.120 --> 44:24.580
Oh, yeah. Look at that.

44:28.250 --> 44:30.711
Martha, wait a second.
Wait a second.

44:30.878 --> 44:31.920
God damn it.

44:32.212 --> 44:33.422
Hold on.

44:33.714 --> 44:34.757
Sweetheart...

44:36.425 --> 44:37.634
Is this a fight?

44:38.052 --> 44:39.887
You're really
upset about that.

44:40.054 --> 44:43.015
Hey, Monster, it's me.

44:43.098 --> 44:44.224
I'm...

44:44.725 --> 44:48.062
I don't think before I act
sometimes

44:48.228 --> 44:50.272
but I'm not a bad person.

44:51.106 --> 44:54.109
You think bad people
have the capacity to...

44:55.569 --> 44:57.279
Love and stuff?

44:58.906 --> 44:59.907
I'm sorry.

44:59.990 --> 45:02.242
You've been through a lot
and I'm...

45:02.409 --> 45:03.489
Wait. Don't go.

45:03.619 --> 45:05.621
I just wanna talk to you,
that's all.

45:10.125 --> 45:11.293
Please?

45:13.962 --> 45:16.298
This is on your head.
All right, Clevon?

45:16.465 --> 45:18.258
I thought you were supposed
to do the hire yourself.

45:18.425 --> 45:19.468
Would you shut
up for a second?

45:19.635 --> 45:22.805
Why would anybody kill our hire in
the middle of public like that?

45:22.971 --> 45:24.932
You know what
doesn't make any sense...

45:25.099 --> 45:27.601
...is you,
here in your fortress.

45:27.684 --> 45:28.977
Okay, okay, listen to me.

45:29.144 --> 45:31.271
If I'd been on that bridge,
your own brother

45:31.355 --> 45:33.482
would be dead right now.
Is that what you want?

45:33.649 --> 45:34.650
No.

45:36.276 --> 45:37.820
I got an address.

45:39.947 --> 45:42.616
I followed him back there.
He dropped off his girlfriend.

45:42.991 --> 45:44.660
Apartment number's
on the back.

45:47.162 --> 45:48.455
Okay, Von.

45:48.664 --> 45:51.792
Go get 10 guys, local,
then go to this girl's place.

45:51.959 --> 45:54.294
When this motherfucker
shows his face...

45:55.170 --> 45:57.506
Blow his face off.

45:57.798 --> 45:59.633
What? Ten guys?

45:59.800 --> 46:00.968
Yeah, other than
you and Moon.

46:01.051 --> 46:02.469
From what you've said,
that sounds appropriate.

46:02.636 --> 46:05.848
But, Richie, what I'm trying to...
No buts.

46:06.014 --> 46:07.474
Get outta here. Go.

46:22.698 --> 46:23.866
Martha.

46:26.326 --> 46:30.038
Martha. There's two guys here
from the FBI to see you.

46:31.707 --> 46:33.208
Are you in there?

46:37.504 --> 46:40.382
His name is Francis Munch.

46:40.674 --> 46:44.094
Formerly one of the world's most
notorious professional killers.

46:45.053 --> 46:47.389
He's been in the game
since he was a teenager.

46:47.556 --> 46:49.600
Trained at various programs.

46:49.933 --> 46:51.852
Privatized, became
a bullet for-hire

46:52.060 --> 46:55.189
and just
a meat-grinder of a man.

46:55.856 --> 46:57.399
About two years ago,

46:57.483 --> 47:00.068
Munch had a nervous
breakdown and quit.

47:00.235 --> 47:01.737
He quit? Why?

47:01.904 --> 47:04.406
The guy has something close
to emotions, always has.

47:04.573 --> 47:05.741
Guilt.

47:05.908 --> 47:06.950
Remorse.

47:07.117 --> 47:11.413
We're guessing these "feelings"
just finally caught up with him.

47:11.580 --> 47:13.332
If he's not
a hitman anymore,

47:13.415 --> 47:15.042
why did he kill
that guy on the bridge?

47:15.209 --> 47:18.295
We think he developed
a kind of moral code.

47:18.545 --> 47:21.089
He's still notorious.
People still try to hire him.

47:21.256 --> 47:24.051
But now, he kills them.

47:24.218 --> 47:26.053
He kills the people
who hire him?

47:26.220 --> 47:27.262
Yeah.

47:27.763 --> 47:31.808
Because "murder is wrong."

47:32.100 --> 47:33.101
That's insane.

47:33.268 --> 47:36.438
I would say that's a
reasonable diagnosis, yes.

47:37.898 --> 47:39.733
Is this the place
where we...

47:39.900 --> 47:41.401
At the restaurant,
yeah.

47:41.568 --> 47:44.947
He said he killed a guy in the parking lot.
I thought he was joking.

47:45.155 --> 47:47.074
I mean,
how dangerous is he?

47:47.241 --> 47:49.284
Well, now...

47:50.577 --> 47:52.120
How dangerous?

47:52.746 --> 47:55.082
There's no kind of chart.

47:55.249 --> 47:58.794
If there was, I'd say he's near the top.
He's just...

47:59.419 --> 48:00.629
Gifted.

48:00.796 --> 48:02.798
Frighteningly gifted.

48:02.965 --> 48:06.468
NSA, Interpol, FBI have made
a combined nine attempts

48:06.635 --> 48:08.262
to take him into custody
in the last two years.

48:08.428 --> 48:13.475
Every direct confrontation has ended
in absolute, unmitigated disaster.

48:13.642 --> 48:15.936
He dances in...

48:16.103 --> 48:19.481
A storm of bullets and chaos,
and he dances out.

48:20.482 --> 48:21.775
So now what?

48:21.942 --> 48:24.486
If he makes any attempt
to contact you,

48:24.987 --> 48:27.030
you call us immediately.

48:27.948 --> 48:29.116
You get it?

48:53.849 --> 48:56.393
<i>Please leave a
message at the tone.</i>

48:56.476 --> 48:58.020
Martha, it's me.

48:58.645 --> 49:01.815
I know the smart move here is to
give you some time and some space.

49:01.982 --> 49:03.984
But I need to see you.

49:04.318 --> 49:06.320
I'm coming over. Okay?

49:06.987 --> 49:08.196
I'm coming over.

49:15.370 --> 49:17.205
Hi.
Hi.

49:17.706 --> 49:20.000
Everything okay?
Everything's great.

49:23.378 --> 49:24.504
Okay.

49:29.343 --> 49:31.053
Do you think
I'm in danger?

49:31.345 --> 49:33.221
We think he's in danger.

49:33.513 --> 49:36.725
The man he killed has a lot of
dangerous people backing him up.

49:36.892 --> 49:39.561
But then, so did the Pirrellos,
and it didn't help them none.

49:39.728 --> 49:40.729
Who?

49:40.896 --> 49:43.023
A little syndicate
in New Jersey.

49:43.190 --> 49:45.192
Drugs, heroin mainly.

49:45.359 --> 49:48.070
Tried to hire Munch
and he killed 'em all.

49:48.528 --> 49:50.864
Only a guy from the Cartigan
family made it out.

49:51.031 --> 49:52.074
John...

49:53.408 --> 49:55.369
Tom? I forget his name.
No.

49:55.535 --> 49:57.704
No. You misunderstand.

49:58.538 --> 50:01.083
I mean, do you think
I'm in any danger from him?

50:02.042 --> 50:03.251
Well...

50:04.711 --> 50:08.090
When you're a contract killer,
you have no friends.

50:08.256 --> 50:10.467
You barely ever
talk to anyone.

50:11.051 --> 50:14.888
You spend hours in
endless motels...

50:16.098 --> 50:17.557
Cars.

50:18.934 --> 50:20.435
Planes.

50:22.437 --> 50:24.064
Just sitting there...

50:24.731 --> 50:26.316
Staring at nothing.

50:27.442 --> 50:30.696
But around you,
his behavior is unique.

50:30.779 --> 50:32.406
He expresses himself.

50:33.240 --> 50:37.327
Emotions other than that blank,
happy thing he's got going on.

50:37.744 --> 50:40.580
You're the one person he's had any
kind of meaningful interaction with

50:40.747 --> 50:42.249
that didn't end in a bullet.

50:42.791 --> 50:47.129
So are you safe?
Are you in danger?

50:47.462 --> 50:49.423
Well, let me put
it to you this way.

50:50.132 --> 50:52.300
You're clearly
an asset to him.

50:53.093 --> 50:55.762
Which makes you
an asset to me.

50:57.764 --> 51:00.058
So you can sleep tight...

51:00.142 --> 51:01.435
Martha.

51:14.781 --> 51:17.492
- Hey, what the fuck, man?
- This beauty's yours.

51:19.119 --> 51:20.839
What the fuck am I
supposed to do with this?

51:20.954 --> 51:21.955
It's simple.

51:22.122 --> 51:25.167
Bullets come out that end.
They hit people and then people die.

51:25.333 --> 51:27.836
This is like some
World War Two-ass old shotgun.

51:28.003 --> 51:31.006
And you said this guy's a
supersonic psycho killer, right?

51:31.298 --> 51:33.858
You want me to go out like I'm
duck hunting on this motherfucker?

51:34.134 --> 51:35.260
I'm sorry, Steve.

51:35.343 --> 51:37.971
It was the best that we
could do on short notice.

51:39.055 --> 51:40.974
Look, he has no idea
we're coming, all right?

51:41.141 --> 51:43.018
Just walk up to the guy and shoot
him in the face, all right?

51:43.310 --> 51:45.520
I've seen crackheads in
Brooklyn with better guns.

51:45.687 --> 51:47.481
I'm sure a cocksucker
like you could do it.

51:47.647 --> 51:50.776
You watch your fucking mouth,
you blinged out, Cajun green goblin.

51:50.859 --> 51:52.569
Look at this shit.

51:53.987 --> 51:56.031
Like Elmer-fucking-Fudd,
man.

52:14.549 --> 52:16.009
Oh! Really? A grenade?

52:18.678 --> 52:20.680
I taught you that one,
Francis.

52:34.528 --> 52:35.987
Ahoy, mate.

52:36.071 --> 52:37.791
Oh, for fuck's sake.

52:40.617 --> 52:42.118
Um...

52:42.786 --> 52:46.081
I know, I know.
Is this guy dead? Or...

52:46.957 --> 52:48.542
Just unconscious.

52:48.625 --> 52:50.418
I'm really sorry.
Okay.

52:50.585 --> 52:53.463
Do you have any...
You have a bathtub, right?

52:53.964 --> 52:57.926
Hey, I'm not sure, um,
that you should be here...

52:58.593 --> 52:59.636
'Cause...

53:00.262 --> 53:03.765
I don't know, I feel
really confused, and...

53:05.308 --> 53:07.602
Like, we should probably
take a break.

53:14.276 --> 53:15.652
What do you mean...

53:16.111 --> 53:17.487
A break?

53:21.658 --> 53:22.742
Okay.

53:22.909 --> 53:23.910
Okay.

53:35.964 --> 53:38.383
No, wait, wait. Okay, um...
What? What?

53:38.466 --> 53:40.051
Like, this whole reverse
hitman thing is like...

53:40.135 --> 53:41.344
It's weird, I know.

53:41.469 --> 53:43.430
Awkward.
I kill a whole bunch of people.

53:43.597 --> 53:45.807
But they suck.
They're like bad people.

53:45.974 --> 53:47.934
But that's not an excuse.
I should stop.

53:48.018 --> 53:50.687
I'm just panic-rationalizing this to
myself. I mean, I realize I'm doing it.

53:50.812 --> 53:53.023
Honey, you are,
but you're doing great.

53:53.189 --> 53:55.483
Okay. Uh-huh? Okay.
Really good.

53:57.819 --> 53:59.195
Okay, whatever.

54:04.159 --> 54:05.493
What the fuck?

54:05.702 --> 54:07.621
- Hey, Sophie.
- Hey, buddy.

54:07.787 --> 54:10.373
Is he dead?
Oh, he's just taking a nap.

54:10.540 --> 54:12.042
I can see him breathing.

54:12.208 --> 54:13.627
What the fuck?

54:17.422 --> 54:19.257
You're gonna take
the east side, right?

54:19.341 --> 54:20.800
Yeah, I'll cover it.
I see anything, I'll let you know.

54:20.884 --> 54:22.844
Shit! Shit!

54:24.721 --> 54:27.557
Hey, uh, Knox, look,
we've got trouble.

54:27.724 --> 54:29.604
<i>Twelve uglies heading
in the building right now.</i>

54:29.684 --> 54:31.353
<i>Knox? Do you copy?</i>

54:31.519 --> 54:32.854
Who the hell is Knox?

54:33.021 --> 54:34.856
He's the FBI guy.

54:35.023 --> 54:36.858
FBI? No, no, no.
Yeah.

54:37.025 --> 54:39.486
That guy Hopper's
a seriously mean bad guy.

54:39.569 --> 54:40.612
Haven't seen him in a while.

54:40.695 --> 54:42.072
He looks different.
He looks different every time.

54:42.155 --> 54:44.324
Who is he?
Oh, it's a long story.

54:44.407 --> 54:47.369
After I left the agency,
he was...

54:47.535 --> 54:49.579
We used to work together.
We were really close.

54:49.746 --> 54:51.247
And then I said,
"I don't wanna kill people."

54:51.414 --> 54:53.654
And he was like,
"You have to come back and kill people."

54:53.750 --> 54:55.543
And he blew up a building
on me in Serbia.

54:55.710 --> 54:58.213
Okay, so he's not with the FBI?
What?

54:58.380 --> 54:59.381
Nope.

55:00.048 --> 55:01.758
We're gonna be fine.
Uh, Francis, I just...

55:01.925 --> 55:04.052
What? What did you
call me?

55:04.928 --> 55:06.262
Did you just call me...

55:06.721 --> 55:08.098
He told you my name?

55:08.264 --> 55:10.892
Motherfucker!
Motherfucker!

55:11.059 --> 55:12.769
Fucking motherfucker!

55:13.103 --> 55:15.313
All right, that was unnecessary.
I'm sorry, let's go. We gotta go.

55:15.397 --> 55:16.690
No, I'm not gonna go.

55:16.773 --> 55:19.567
Why not? 'Cause you're a criminal,
and you lied to me.

55:19.734 --> 55:21.778
Martha, you can't go with him.
He just killed a cop.

55:21.945 --> 55:23.071
Shut your face. Thank you.

55:23.238 --> 55:25.699
I never lied to you.
Not once did I ever lie to you.

55:25.865 --> 55:27.784
Martha, listen to me.
Well, I guess, yeah, that's true.

55:27.951 --> 55:30.412
I mean, I did think
you were joking, in fairness.

55:30.578 --> 55:32.580
Martha, we should call the police now.
Please.

55:32.747 --> 55:36.167
I'm gonna shoot you in the armpit.
Great, great. Can't wait.

55:36.251 --> 55:38.003
I would never do that,
I'm not gonna shoot her.

55:38.086 --> 55:39.713
We've got a dead body
in our home, hello!

55:39.796 --> 55:42.215
How about if I miss your armpit,
I'm gonna shoot you in the eye?

55:42.298 --> 55:44.134
I'm not talking to you right now.
I would never do that.

55:44.217 --> 55:45.552
- I'm sorry. I'm pretending.
- He could kill us!

55:45.635 --> 55:47.095
We could be
dead in an hour!

55:47.554 --> 55:50.140
Martha! Martha!
Get off of me!

55:50.306 --> 55:53.018
You live in there now, in silence.
I'll let you out later.

55:53.101 --> 55:54.561
- I never lied to you.
- I'm not gonna be silent!

55:54.644 --> 55:56.521
I mean, what do you want from me?
I'm here. That's real.

55:56.604 --> 55:59.691
I don't know, though,
'cause you show up, and you're, like,

55:59.774 --> 56:01.401
the greatest thing ever,
and then...

56:01.484 --> 56:03.528
I can't believe you're
letting him lock me in like this!

56:03.611 --> 56:06.031
You kill people,
and this guy's from the FBI,

56:06.114 --> 56:07.782
but then he's not
from the FBI, and...

56:07.949 --> 56:10.535
I don't know.
It's just overwhelming, you know?

56:10.660 --> 56:12.328
I mean, I don't think it's healthy.

56:12.412 --> 56:13.413
- Nobody's normal.
- Fuck you guys.

56:13.496 --> 56:15.498
Nobody's normal,
nobody's healthy.

56:15.665 --> 56:17.208
Listen to me.
We don't have time,

56:17.292 --> 56:19.461
so you've gotta
decide now. Okay?

56:19.627 --> 56:21.546
I love you.
I wanna do this.

56:21.629 --> 56:23.131
What are you gonna do
for the rest of your life?

56:23.298 --> 56:26.468
You and me, you're all I've got.
Am I being crazy?

56:26.634 --> 56:28.011
Am I nuts?

56:28.344 --> 56:29.721
Let's do this. This is it.

56:29.804 --> 56:31.473
Now, honey,
we've gotta do this now.

56:31.639 --> 56:34.726
- My God, stop talking.
- I'm totally into it.

56:34.809 --> 56:37.645
- Yeah?
- You're both fucking insane!

56:37.812 --> 56:38.855
Let's go.

56:40.690 --> 56:42.442
Ah! This is gonna be tough.
Why?

56:42.525 --> 56:43.568
I can't kill anybody.

56:43.651 --> 56:45.278
Last time I killed somebody,
you really freaked out.

56:45.361 --> 56:46.738
Oh, no, no, I'm fine.

56:46.821 --> 56:48.698
Okay, now don't do that.
Don't do what?

56:48.823 --> 56:50.742
Well, 'cause later you'll say...
No, I'm not doing anything.

56:50.825 --> 56:52.118
Trust me?
Yes.

56:52.202 --> 56:53.453
You look hot.

56:53.536 --> 56:55.663
You look beautiful.
Hold my hand. Okay.

57:34.327 --> 57:36.162
Ho! Nice shot!

57:39.916 --> 57:41.918
Yeah! Nice, baby!

58:06.901 --> 58:10.071
You all right? Huh?
How'd you do that?

58:10.238 --> 58:12.699
Oh, some people waste
time with the "fighting."

58:12.782 --> 58:14.062
I skip straight
to the "winning."

58:14.242 --> 58:15.682
We'd better
get out of here.

58:25.128 --> 58:27.589
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

58:29.090 --> 58:30.133
Fuck!

58:31.301 --> 58:33.386
Whoa! Hey...

58:34.095 --> 58:35.471
Fuck!

58:36.264 --> 58:38.600
Was that even a shotgun?

58:38.766 --> 58:40.643
What the hell was that?
What just hit me?

58:40.810 --> 58:42.645
You okay?
Fine. Fine.

58:42.812 --> 58:44.439
Is it bad?
You look handsome.

58:44.606 --> 58:46.482
Thanks.
How's my hair? Yeah.

58:46.649 --> 58:47.942
Hey!

58:50.278 --> 58:53.615
Ah! Fuck, it hurts!
Fuck, it hurts!

58:54.282 --> 58:56.159
That was great.
That was really...

58:56.326 --> 58:58.620
I totally didn't
see that coming.

58:58.786 --> 59:00.538
You really got me.
What's your name?

59:00.747 --> 59:01.748
Steve.

59:03.082 --> 59:05.293
Oh! Too many things
happening, Steve.

59:05.460 --> 59:09.505
Martha, trying not to kill anybody.
I went ADD for a sec.

59:09.672 --> 59:11.799
Why didn't you grab her?
Take her hostage?

59:12.008 --> 59:13.676
I didn't think that
would be cool, man.

59:13.843 --> 59:15.345
You didn't that would be cool?
Get a load of this guy.

59:15.428 --> 59:16.788
He didn't think
that would be cool.

59:17.472 --> 59:18.640
You got talent.

59:18.806 --> 59:21.476
Why the fuck did they give you
that piece of shit shotgun?

59:21.684 --> 59:22.810
I don't know.

59:22.977 --> 59:24.979
Baby. We should go.

59:25.355 --> 59:27.649
Thank you for not
taking me hostage.

59:31.110 --> 59:32.111
Baby...

59:41.996 --> 59:43.122
Ah!

59:50.880 --> 59:53.424
Who the fuck are these guys now?
They seem super pissed, right?

59:53.508 --> 59:54.550
Yeah.

59:54.634 --> 59:56.302
Where the fuck is Johnny?

59:57.220 --> 59:59.180
I'm gonna kill one of these guys.
That's fine.

59:59.347 --> 01:00:02.016
It's the last one, I promise.
No, I don't care.

01:00:02.183 --> 01:00:03.685
Yeah, you say that now,
but then later in the car

01:00:03.768 --> 01:00:05.103
you're gonna be like,
"Why'd you have to..."

01:00:05.186 --> 01:00:06.896
No, I don't care.
Okay.

01:00:09.399 --> 01:00:11.859
Son of a bitch!

01:00:12.068 --> 01:00:13.403
Okay, fellas.

01:00:13.569 --> 01:00:15.822
So you saw that I could
basically kill

01:00:15.905 --> 01:00:17.907
all of you guys
from here, right?

01:00:18.074 --> 01:00:19.367
Was that dude your buddy?

01:00:19.534 --> 01:00:21.869
I mean, look at that guy.
That's it, that's game over.

01:00:22.036 --> 01:00:25.039
Imagine Christmas with his parents.
Maybe he's got kids.

01:00:25.206 --> 01:00:27.750
What if he's got a cat?
Maybe he's got a cat.

01:00:27.917 --> 01:00:30.378
Who's gonna feed his cat?
Who's gonna feed your cats?

01:00:30.545 --> 01:00:32.755
I know they're paying you,
but I mean, is it worth it?

01:00:32.922 --> 01:00:35.550
We all know how
this is gonna go down.

01:00:35.717 --> 01:00:37.218
No shame here.

01:00:37.385 --> 01:00:38.553
Good?

01:00:38.761 --> 01:00:39.887
Anybody?

01:00:41.264 --> 01:00:43.349
Hey! Where the fuck
are you going?

01:00:43.433 --> 01:00:44.851
We paid you for the day!

01:00:45.018 --> 01:00:46.227
Fuck this, man!

01:00:46.436 --> 01:00:47.562
Okay.

01:00:48.104 --> 01:00:49.397
Anyone else?

01:00:49.564 --> 01:00:51.399
Go fuck yourself!

01:00:51.524 --> 01:00:53.151
Oh...

01:00:53.609 --> 01:00:55.737
That wasn't very nice.

01:00:56.571 --> 01:00:59.615
Hey, we got some chips here.
We got some pitchers of lemonade.

01:00:59.782 --> 01:01:02.285
Why don't we hang out and
talk about this for a second?

01:01:02.785 --> 01:01:05.580
What are you doing?
Just give me a little push.

01:01:05.747 --> 01:01:07.081
It's gonna be okay.

01:01:07.457 --> 01:01:08.583
Ready?

01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:10.126
One, two, three.

01:01:17.258 --> 01:01:18.468
How you feeling, fellas?

01:01:18.634 --> 01:01:20.803
I had fun.
Nobody got hurt.

01:01:20.887 --> 01:01:22.138
Well, a little hurt.

01:01:22.305 --> 01:01:23.806
You should
call an ambulance.

01:01:24.766 --> 01:01:26.476
Hey, you.
Wanna call an ambulance?

01:01:26.642 --> 01:01:28.102
Okay, look, don't shoot.

01:01:28.186 --> 01:01:29.979
This was just
a big mistake.

01:01:30.855 --> 01:01:32.023
There you go.

01:01:33.775 --> 01:01:35.943
Have we met?
Kinda.

01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:37.445
New Jersey, right?

01:01:37.779 --> 01:01:39.197
The Poconos,
the Pinocchios, or something?

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:40.365
Yeah.

01:01:40.448 --> 01:01:44.118
The Pirrellos.
Pirrellos! Yeah.

01:01:44.285 --> 01:01:47.121
Vinnie, right?
It's Von, but don't...

01:01:47.288 --> 01:01:48.539
Yeah.

01:01:48.623 --> 01:01:51.084
You were the guy
hiding under the table.

01:01:51.250 --> 01:01:53.461
It was my first big gunfight.
It was scary.

01:01:53.628 --> 01:01:54.754
Vinnie, what did I tell you?

01:01:54.837 --> 01:01:56.464
Did I tell you to
stay out of trouble?

01:01:56.631 --> 01:01:57.965
Stay out of trouble.
That's right.

01:01:58.132 --> 01:01:59.300
This isn't staying
out of trouble, Vinnie.

01:01:59.467 --> 01:02:01.107
I'm not the one that
hired you. All right?

01:02:01.135 --> 01:02:02.553
That was my brother,
Richie.

01:02:02.637 --> 01:02:04.013
He is the one
that you want.

01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:05.681
I literally don't care.

01:02:10.144 --> 01:02:11.938
Okay, that's enough.
Get away from him.

01:02:14.982 --> 01:02:17.652
Steve,
is that you?

01:02:18.319 --> 01:02:20.279
Good for you, pal,
you got me again.

01:02:20.363 --> 01:02:22.365
Martha!

01:02:24.033 --> 01:02:26.369
A clown nose,
wow, that's...

01:02:26.702 --> 01:02:27.995
That's a cute gimmick.

01:02:28.162 --> 01:02:30.998
You know, one time I was
gonna wear bowties...

01:02:31.332 --> 01:02:34.210
Then I decided to be the guy who
just killed all your friends.

01:02:34.961 --> 01:02:36.879
I don't get it, man.
Why we taking this girl?

01:02:37.046 --> 01:02:38.406
Let's just shoot
that motherfucker.

01:02:38.548 --> 01:02:39.674
Steve...

01:02:40.007 --> 01:02:42.343
Just do what you're told.
Okay?

01:02:43.344 --> 01:02:45.346
Johnny, let's go!

01:02:48.474 --> 01:02:49.892
Wait a second, Vinnie.

01:02:50.059 --> 01:02:53.062
You want her, you come and get her.
Fremont and Oleda.

01:02:53.646 --> 01:02:54.856
This is a bad call.

01:02:55.022 --> 01:02:56.983
Hey, what about us, man?
Fucking bums!

01:02:57.150 --> 01:02:58.526
That's what happens
when you Craigslist criminals.

01:02:58.693 --> 01:03:01.362
Wait a second.
Bad move. Bad move, man!

01:03:01.737 --> 01:03:02.864
Bad move.

01:03:07.535 --> 01:03:08.661
You're awake.

01:03:08.828 --> 01:03:11.831
You having fun making a fool
out of yourself, Francis?

01:03:11.998 --> 01:03:13.332
Don't call me that.

01:03:13.875 --> 01:03:16.711
What happened to you?

01:03:17.336 --> 01:03:19.547
You used to be
like the grim reaper.

01:03:20.339 --> 01:03:21.883
I remember there was a...

01:03:23.885 --> 01:03:26.888
A guy, he was a Yakuza twat,
I think...

01:03:27.346 --> 01:03:30.057
And he literally
pissed himself

01:03:30.224 --> 01:03:31.784
just 'cause he heard
you was on the way.

01:03:33.186 --> 01:03:34.228
What?

01:03:35.521 --> 01:03:37.190
The clown nose is tacky.

01:03:37.857 --> 01:03:40.026
Is there some kind of
joke I'm not getting?

01:03:40.193 --> 01:03:41.402
Knock, knock.

01:03:42.403 --> 01:03:43.404
Who's there?

01:03:43.696 --> 01:03:45.573
The joke
you're not getting.

01:03:46.073 --> 01:03:48.534
Get it?

01:03:48.701 --> 01:03:50.286
That's hilarious, Francis.

01:03:50.912 --> 01:03:53.414
Well, now it's time
to go home.

01:03:53.873 --> 01:03:55.875
You should smile more.

01:03:56.042 --> 01:03:57.585
You'd be more popular.

01:03:57.752 --> 01:04:00.087
That's a nice smile. See?

01:04:00.254 --> 01:04:02.215
Police! Put your hands
where I can see them!

01:04:02.381 --> 01:04:03.716
On the ground!
Stay on the ground!

01:04:03.883 --> 01:04:05.051
Well, what took you
so long?

01:04:05.218 --> 01:04:07.553
I was waiting for backup.
Nobody's here yet.

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:10.932
You're here now, so relax.
He's in custody.

01:04:13.392 --> 01:04:14.727
Why are you
talking like that?

01:04:17.563 --> 01:04:19.607
Why is everything
such a problem?

01:04:21.776 --> 01:04:23.236
Oh, bollocks.

01:04:25.279 --> 01:04:27.532
- Listen, it's actually a very simple plan.
- All right.

01:04:27.698 --> 01:04:29.178
The girl is exactly
where we want her.

01:04:29.325 --> 01:04:31.202
She's in Richard's office,
so the bait is set.

01:04:31.369 --> 01:04:34.205
All that we have to do is wait
for that maniac to come here,

01:04:34.372 --> 01:04:36.012
he kills everyone
that stands in his path.

01:04:36.123 --> 01:04:39.252
We find an excuse, any excuse,
to get the fuck out of here.

01:04:39.418 --> 01:04:40.962
And then...
Blip-blap-blop...

01:04:41.045 --> 01:04:42.565
Richard's gone,
I'm king of the castle.

01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:43.990
What doesn't make
sense about this?

01:04:44.131 --> 01:04:45.716
I don't know.
All of it?

01:04:47.885 --> 01:04:50.054
Richard is waiting for you.
Thanks, dickhead.

01:04:50.221 --> 01:04:53.140
Peace to you, too.
No. Just him.

01:04:53.975 --> 01:04:57.019
You're telling me that
you shot this guy in the face

01:04:57.395 --> 01:04:59.730
and he just survived?

01:04:59.897 --> 01:05:02.984
It was your guys that gave me a
900-year-old fucking shotgun.

01:05:03.150 --> 01:05:05.152
- Really?
- So with all due respect, mister,

01:05:05.319 --> 01:05:07.071
I don't understand
what happened.

01:05:07.238 --> 01:05:08.739
Just give me my fucking money...

01:05:08.823 --> 01:05:09.991
and I'm out the door.

01:05:11.242 --> 01:05:12.493
I apologize.

01:05:12.743 --> 01:05:14.161
What was your name again?
Steve.

01:05:14.328 --> 01:05:15.413
Steve.

01:05:15.913 --> 01:05:17.081
Steve...

01:05:17.248 --> 01:05:18.583
What do you
like on your pizza?

01:05:18.916 --> 01:05:20.501
Cheese, man.
Yeah?

01:05:21.669 --> 01:05:23.004
Yeah? Cheese?

01:05:23.838 --> 01:05:25.756
How about some extra cheese?

01:05:28.968 --> 01:05:30.177
Still working.

01:05:30.678 --> 01:05:31.804
That's a good phone.

01:05:32.471 --> 01:05:33.514
Now...

01:05:34.307 --> 01:05:36.142
You.
No, listen.

01:05:36.309 --> 01:05:37.435
This is what me and
Johnny are gonna do.

01:05:37.518 --> 01:05:38.644
We're gonna go out there,
all right?

01:05:38.811 --> 01:05:39.931
We're gonna
get the word out,

01:05:39.979 --> 01:05:42.189
then we're gonna throw up
a 100-grand reward.

01:05:42.356 --> 01:05:45.443
- $100,000? That's your plan?
- That's my plan.

01:05:47.361 --> 01:05:48.988
That's a stupid idea.

01:05:49.155 --> 01:05:52.700
Bruce, what the fuck do you
even do around here, man?

01:05:53.367 --> 01:05:55.286
If we don't know
where this guy is,

01:05:55.453 --> 01:05:57.204
no one can afford
to leave this house.

01:05:57.288 --> 01:05:58.539
- Mmm-hmm.
- Honestly...

01:05:59.332 --> 01:06:01.667
I think the safe bet
is just to let her go.

01:06:01.751 --> 01:06:02.960
Hmm?

01:06:03.044 --> 01:06:04.587
Let her go? Really?

01:06:04.670 --> 01:06:06.631
That's your fucking idea?

01:06:06.714 --> 01:06:10.301
You know what?
You have no idea what you are doing.

01:06:10.468 --> 01:06:12.803
You have no balls, no...
Yeah?

01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:15.306
Fuck! Son of a bitch!

01:06:17.308 --> 01:06:20.227
I'm going to work much harder
to control my anger.

01:06:20.394 --> 01:06:21.812
But people are dead.

01:06:22.063 --> 01:06:24.982
The bodies are piling up
and Dad is kinda gonna notice.

01:06:25.399 --> 01:06:28.527
And the fault is yours,
you piece of shit wormfuck.

01:06:28.694 --> 01:06:33.324
I have been defending your
worthless cokehead ass for years.

01:06:33.491 --> 01:06:35.826
Fucking years.

01:06:35.993 --> 01:06:37.578
And now I realize...

01:06:39.205 --> 01:06:40.456
I was wrong.

01:06:43.042 --> 01:06:44.960
You should've died
with the Pirrellos.

01:06:48.130 --> 01:06:49.298
Fuck you, Richie!

01:06:49.465 --> 01:06:51.545
Just take the girl and get
the fuck out of this room.

01:06:52.385 --> 01:06:55.763
And I don't give a shit if you tell
Mom that I beat your ass, either.

01:06:58.474 --> 01:07:01.602
Bruce, nobody else leaves.
No more fuck-ups.

01:07:01.769 --> 01:07:05.022
If that cocksucker has the
balls to show up here,

01:07:05.189 --> 01:07:06.691
we hit him with
everything we got.

01:07:10.403 --> 01:07:11.904
Okay, okay.

01:07:12.738 --> 01:07:15.700
I lost track of my dumb
decisions a long time ago.

01:07:19.912 --> 01:07:22.832
And you guys had
an automatic M16,

01:07:22.998 --> 01:07:25.084
military issue
with a laser scope,

01:07:25.251 --> 01:07:27.503
and you give me a fucking
Elmer Fudd shotgun?

01:07:29.338 --> 01:07:30.339
Fuck this.

01:07:36.429 --> 01:07:37.847
Fuck,
we are totally fucked.

01:07:38.013 --> 01:07:40.349
We're gonna be stuck here
when that psychopath shows up.

01:07:40.516 --> 01:07:42.935
Will you get this for me?
I can't do it. Yeah.

01:07:43.102 --> 01:07:44.478
Yeah, we're fucked.
Big deal.

01:07:44.645 --> 01:07:46.480
You started this ride, Von.

01:07:46.689 --> 01:07:49.089
You're the one who pushed the
shitball rolling down the hill.

01:07:50.359 --> 01:07:51.527
Seriously?
Mmm-hmm?

01:07:51.736 --> 01:07:53.904
Will you please
shut the fuck up?

01:07:54.196 --> 01:07:56.115
Watch your mouth
with me, man.

01:07:57.533 --> 01:07:59.160
Or what?

01:07:59.368 --> 01:08:01.120
Don't let this
become un-fun.

01:08:01.287 --> 01:08:03.205
It's supposed
to be fun, right?

01:08:03.372 --> 01:08:05.374
Or I get a bad attitude.

01:08:05.875 --> 01:08:08.043
Who the fuck do
you think you are?

01:08:08.210 --> 01:08:10.546
I'm fucking Johnny Moon.

01:08:15.384 --> 01:08:16.469
What?

01:08:22.265 --> 01:08:23.809
Okay. You wanna have some fun?
Yeah.

01:08:23.975 --> 01:08:25.060
You wanna have some fun?

01:08:26.479 --> 01:08:28.439
What's that, baby?
I couldn't hear you under this.

01:08:30.774 --> 01:08:33.986
Okay.
This is you guys.

01:08:34.904 --> 01:08:37.615
"Oh, no! He's
gonna come and kill us!"

01:08:37.782 --> 01:08:40.493
"Uh! I'm Johnny Moon!
I love you, Von!"

01:08:40.576 --> 01:08:43.203
"I love you, too, Johnny!
Do you wanna go on a camping trip?"

01:08:43.287 --> 01:08:45.206
"Oh, anywhere
with you, buddy."

01:08:45.747 --> 01:08:48.167
I like this bitch, I do.

01:08:51.252 --> 01:08:52.254
So...

01:08:53.005 --> 01:08:54.840
Why don't you tell me...

01:08:55.006 --> 01:08:56.425
What's it like?

01:08:57.176 --> 01:08:59.470
Having an IQ over 17?

01:09:00.261 --> 01:09:02.264
Dating a serial killer.

01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:08.520
Now, I gotta slow you down right
there for a second, 'cause...

01:09:08.854 --> 01:09:12.358
To be honest,
I don't understand your plan.

01:09:13.274 --> 01:09:16.529
Like, is it
a "get killed" plan?

01:09:16.694 --> 01:09:18.863
Is it like a plan
to get killed?

01:09:19.031 --> 01:09:22.033
Like an elaborate
sort of suicide pact?

01:09:26.622 --> 01:09:27.872
Stings, right?

01:09:28.332 --> 01:09:30.125
Are you stupid?

01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:33.546
You're so fucked.

01:09:35.464 --> 01:09:38.133
When he gets here,
you better hope you're long gone.

01:09:38.634 --> 01:09:41.470
Because he's
going to kill you.

01:09:42.136 --> 01:09:44.180
And if he doesn't,

01:09:44.265 --> 01:09:45.724
I will.

01:09:45.808 --> 01:09:48.853
You're gonna kill me?
You are?

01:09:49.019 --> 01:09:53.232
Well, they tell me successful
people set achievable goals, so...

01:09:58.445 --> 01:10:01.156
How does it feel now?
Huh, bitch?

01:10:04.994 --> 01:10:06.328
I feel...

01:10:10.666 --> 01:10:12.877
I feel motivated.

01:10:16.922 --> 01:10:18.591
Those fuckers.
"Oh, do this, Steve.

01:10:18.757 --> 01:10:20.926
"Do that, Steve. Come on,
Steve, you can handle it.

01:10:21.093 --> 01:10:22.928
"Take the fucked
up shotgun, Steve."

01:10:26.098 --> 01:10:27.558
Hey, what's going on?

01:10:28.225 --> 01:10:29.435
Uh-uh!

01:10:33.439 --> 01:10:35.608
Ooh! That looks good.

01:10:36.191 --> 01:10:37.943
How many guys inside?

01:10:38.110 --> 01:10:42.448
Got fucking Von, Johnny,
Bruce, Richie, so that's four.

01:10:42.615 --> 01:10:45.159
Plus six other motherfuckers
with automatic weapons, man.

01:10:46.452 --> 01:10:47.536
May I?

01:10:58.422 --> 01:11:01.050
That oughta stir 'em up.
What happened to your face?

01:11:01.592 --> 01:11:03.928
Fucking asshole Richie
beat me with a phone.

01:11:04.094 --> 01:11:05.763
Get outta town.

01:11:05.930 --> 01:11:08.265
No, I'm serious, man.
Motherfucker beat me with a phone.

01:11:08.432 --> 01:11:10.017
What a jerk.
Yeah.

01:11:10.184 --> 01:11:12.686
Can I have some of these gummy bears?
I like the green ones.

01:11:12.853 --> 01:11:15.940
Help yourself. That's funny,
I hate the fucking green ones.

01:11:16.106 --> 01:11:17.274
Really? Perfect.

01:11:17.608 --> 01:11:18.776
You know what I mean?

01:11:20.527 --> 01:11:21.946
All right, see you inside?

01:11:22.279 --> 01:11:23.864
That's what they paid me for.

01:11:24.031 --> 01:11:25.449
Good luck, buddy.

01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:28.702
This fucking guy is crazy.

01:11:29.870 --> 01:11:32.164
Von, go to
Richard's office

01:11:32.247 --> 01:11:33.582
and take him down
in the basement.

01:11:36.043 --> 01:11:37.127
You...

01:11:37.378 --> 01:11:38.671
Upstairs.

01:11:45.219 --> 01:11:47.721
Don't worry, Richie, everything's
under control.

01:12:13.414 --> 01:12:14.915
Motherfucker!

01:12:15.082 --> 01:12:17.251
What's going on?
You having a hard time with that?

01:12:17.418 --> 01:12:20.087
You know, I'm used to a smaller
caliber gun than this.

01:12:20.170 --> 01:12:21.588
Here, let me
take a look at that.

01:12:23.841 --> 01:12:25.926
It's a nice gun.
Thanks.

01:12:26.093 --> 01:12:28.345
There you go.
You want your gun back?

01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:31.765
Do you want it back?
Please?

01:12:31.932 --> 01:12:33.684
Psych.

01:12:34.435 --> 01:12:36.395
Son of a bitch, man!

01:12:36.562 --> 01:12:37.771
Where's Martha?

01:12:38.772 --> 01:12:40.816
Fuck you.

01:12:49.950 --> 01:12:52.661
All right, I'll find her myself.
What?

01:12:52.953 --> 01:12:55.956
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

01:12:56.123 --> 01:12:57.875
Don't you wanna kill him?
What?

01:12:58.042 --> 01:13:00.294
You know, do your thing
with the thing that you do?

01:13:00.461 --> 01:13:02.629
Nuh... What?
The hitman thing that you do.

01:13:02.796 --> 01:13:04.548
Where they try to hire you
and then you kill them

01:13:04.715 --> 01:13:07.843
out of some fucking misguided moral
fucking purpose that you have.

01:13:08.010 --> 01:13:10.304
That crazy bullshit.
No, no.

01:13:10.471 --> 01:13:12.431
I promised my girlfriend.
I don't do that anymore.

01:13:12.556 --> 01:13:14.641
What?
Yeah. You ever met a girl,

01:13:14.808 --> 01:13:16.393
and it's just like...

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:18.645
You can't eat, you can't stop
thinking about her?

01:13:18.812 --> 01:13:21.148
Dude! Spare me the bullshit.

01:13:21.315 --> 01:13:24.526
I brought you all the
way here to kill him!

01:13:24.693 --> 01:13:27.696
And you tell me that you're
not killing anymore?

01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:28.989
What the fuck?

01:13:29.156 --> 01:13:32.076
I'm sorry, man,
I don't mean to let you down.

01:13:32.242 --> 01:13:34.661
I just have no desire
to kill you or your brother.

01:13:34.745 --> 01:13:36.080
I'm just here to
pick up my girlfriend.

01:13:36.246 --> 01:13:39.083
What the fuck, Clevon?
Shut the fuck up, Richie!

01:13:39.249 --> 01:13:41.126
Yeah, you're letting me down
in a big way!

01:13:41.293 --> 01:13:43.921
I think you two have some
issues to talk about.

01:13:44.088 --> 01:13:45.672
I'm just gonna
leave you to it.

01:13:51.512 --> 01:13:53.639
Richie, get off!
Gimme that! Ow!

01:13:53.847 --> 01:13:56.016
Ow! Hey! What's with
you and the biting?

01:14:03.941 --> 01:14:05.400
Fuck.

01:14:20.791 --> 01:14:22.042
Hey, what's happening?

01:14:22.626 --> 01:14:23.627
Gorgeous.

01:14:25.671 --> 01:14:26.922
Okay.

01:14:27.005 --> 01:14:29.591
What are you doing? What is that?
Like tae Kwon do or something?

01:14:29.758 --> 01:14:32.010
It's karate. The thing is,
I don't do karate.

01:14:32.177 --> 01:14:33.428
So that's not fair.

01:14:33.595 --> 01:14:35.514
You got a fucking
gun in your hand.

01:14:35.639 --> 01:14:38.600
All right,
well, I'll tell you what.

01:14:38.767 --> 01:14:41.603
If I promise to put the gun down,
will you not use karate?

01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:47.442
Okay. All right, I'm gonna
put the gun down.

01:14:47.609 --> 01:14:49.444
All right, we're all good.

01:14:49.528 --> 01:14:51.947
Ah! Fuck!
That was karate!

01:14:52.114 --> 01:14:53.740
That's definitely karate!

01:14:54.449 --> 01:14:56.785
Wait a sec!
Wait a second!

01:15:00.164 --> 01:15:01.206
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

01:15:01.290 --> 01:15:03.709
That's a grenade.
What's the plan here?

01:15:04.042 --> 01:15:05.794
It's a small room.

01:15:06.044 --> 01:15:08.463
This is bad.
That's real bad.

01:15:08.881 --> 01:15:10.299
Why do you have a grenade?

01:15:10.799 --> 01:15:13.051
Never mind.
I don't wanna die.

01:15:13.802 --> 01:15:14.803
Yeah.

01:15:15.470 --> 01:15:17.764
Okay, hold on a second.
Just stay still.

01:15:18.223 --> 01:15:19.308
Okay.

01:15:19.725 --> 01:15:22.102
Just breathe, just breathe.
Now you're making me nervous.

01:15:22.269 --> 01:15:25.147
Okay, you're shaking
a little bit. Be careful, be careful.

01:15:25.314 --> 01:15:26.899
We're gonna do this
together. Ready?

01:15:27.065 --> 01:15:30.235
One, two, three.
There we go.

01:15:30.402 --> 01:15:32.404
Yeah. We did that.

01:15:32.571 --> 01:15:33.864
Why don't you sit down?

01:15:34.031 --> 01:15:36.825
Go ahead, sit down.
Relax. Just breathe.

01:15:36.992 --> 01:15:39.494
Out through the nose,
in through the mouth.

01:15:40.662 --> 01:15:41.747
Freeze!

01:15:41.997 --> 01:15:44.917
Hey! Whoa, Steve!
Look at you.

01:15:45.083 --> 01:15:47.252
That's my man Steve.
What's happening?

01:15:47.419 --> 01:15:50.255
Well, there's no way I could get my gun.
I mean, you got...

01:15:50.589 --> 01:15:52.216
A little red dot
on my heart.

01:15:52.507 --> 01:15:56.178
I mean, I don't think I could.
Could I?

01:15:56.511 --> 01:15:59.097
Hey, your bosses
are in the other room

01:15:59.181 --> 01:16:00.807
trying to kill each other.

01:16:01.016 --> 01:16:02.851
Do you hate me?
Do you wanna kill me?

01:16:02.935 --> 01:16:04.102
Is that important to you?

01:16:04.436 --> 01:16:07.356
It's not worth it to me.
I'm just here to pick up my girlfriend.

01:16:07.522 --> 01:16:08.941
So you know what?

01:16:09.107 --> 01:16:10.943
Here's what I'm gonna do,
I'm gonna put my gun down.

01:16:11.109 --> 01:16:12.152
Okay?

01:16:16.198 --> 01:16:17.699
What's the move, Steve?

01:16:26.208 --> 01:16:27.292
You know what?

01:16:27.459 --> 01:16:29.670
I like you more than those
motherfuckers anyway, man.

01:16:29.836 --> 01:16:30.963
I like you, too, man.

01:16:31.129 --> 01:16:32.798
Hey, you know Bruce?
Bruce, Steve.

01:16:32.965 --> 01:16:34.716
Yeah. We met
at the office.

01:16:34.883 --> 01:16:35.884
Bruce is having a hard day.

01:16:35.968 --> 01:16:37.648
Maybe you could look
after him for a while.

01:16:37.803 --> 01:16:40.138
I gotta go. I'll see you.

01:16:44.851 --> 01:16:45.852
Mmm!

01:16:49.356 --> 01:16:50.482
Mmm!

01:16:52.025 --> 01:16:53.610
Hey, Monster.
Hey, honey.

01:16:54.278 --> 01:16:55.904
Ahhh!
Sorry.

01:16:56.196 --> 01:16:58.448
That was thoughtless.
Terribly sorry.

01:17:00.701 --> 01:17:02.911
What? What are you
waiting for?

01:17:03.704 --> 01:17:05.080
Gosh, you're cute.

01:17:06.456 --> 01:17:08.375
You just like me tied up.

01:17:08.542 --> 01:17:10.502
You pervert.

01:17:11.211 --> 01:17:12.963
It's true.
I see it now.

01:17:13.130 --> 01:17:14.339
It's true.

01:17:14.506 --> 01:17:16.800
Okay.
Get in here, get in here. Come here.

01:17:17.551 --> 01:17:19.970
That's mine now. That's mine now.
You like that?

01:17:21.805 --> 01:17:23.307
Why are we going
so slowly?

01:17:23.473 --> 01:17:26.018
Well, I'm a little afraid of
that guy with the tank top.

01:17:26.184 --> 01:17:28.312
Oh, Johnny Moon?
Yeah.

01:17:28.979 --> 01:17:32.065
Is that his name? Ridiculous
I know, it's so stupid.

01:17:32.399 --> 01:17:34.318
You know he spit on my face?
What?

01:17:34.484 --> 01:17:37.279
That's not the worst of it.
He made fun of my nose.

01:17:37.446 --> 01:17:40.282
Oh, no. I like how the nose looks.
You do?

01:17:40.407 --> 01:17:43.869
Yeah, 'cause it's like, it feels
like everybody's having a good time.

01:17:44.036 --> 01:17:46.038
Yeah, well, ideally they are,
you know, but...

01:17:51.084 --> 01:17:53.378
Baby. Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

01:17:53.587 --> 01:17:55.255
Knock it off, Francis.

01:17:56.757 --> 01:18:00.844
Get out! Get outta here!
Get out! Run!

01:18:01.178 --> 01:18:02.512
All right, wait a second.

01:18:03.430 --> 01:18:04.598
Let's talk about this.

01:18:22.741 --> 01:18:23.784
Come on.

01:18:36.338 --> 01:18:38.131
He must
really like you.

01:18:38.465 --> 01:18:40.300
I sure hope so,
'cause otherwise...

01:18:40.467 --> 01:18:42.552
Coming to save me and
killing all these guys is

01:18:42.719 --> 01:18:44.596
sending some seriously
mixed messages.

01:18:47.974 --> 01:18:51.061
God, can you not
laugh right now?

01:18:51.228 --> 01:18:53.063
I've got blood
in my ass crack

01:18:53.230 --> 01:18:56.149
and my face hurts
from you guys hitting me.

01:18:56.316 --> 01:18:58.527
You're being
a real ass, you know.

01:18:58.693 --> 01:19:01.238
You know, it's funny, you being
down there and me up here.

01:19:01.655 --> 01:19:03.073
It reminds me of
when I was little.

01:19:03.156 --> 01:19:04.866
There was this kid, Eric.

01:19:05.033 --> 01:19:07.244
Oh, this is gonna be
a great story, I can tell.

01:19:08.328 --> 01:19:11.164
Now this kid, he would
pick on me every day, man.

01:19:11.498 --> 01:19:14.251
He would scrunch up
my lunch bag every day.

01:19:14.835 --> 01:19:18.004
And I thought, you know,
that kid, he's bigger than me.

01:19:18.255 --> 01:19:19.923
He's stronger than me.

01:19:20.090 --> 01:19:23.343
But you're gonna like this,
he had this turtle.

01:19:24.845 --> 01:19:28.598
The most important part is
he loved this turtle.

01:19:29.850 --> 01:19:32.602
And I thought, you know,
I'm bigger than a turtle.

01:19:32.936 --> 01:19:34.771
I'm stronger than a turtle.

01:19:36.022 --> 01:19:38.692
And do you know the sound a
turtle makes when you, uh...

01:19:39.025 --> 01:19:40.110
Crush it?

01:19:45.699 --> 01:19:47.284
It screams.

01:19:49.035 --> 01:19:50.954
Now you're
catching my drift, right?

01:19:51.538 --> 01:19:53.623
Clown Nose shows up,
he sees you bleeding out,

01:19:53.707 --> 01:19:55.208
gets him thrown off
his game.

01:19:56.042 --> 01:19:59.212
Squish.
Johnny Moon wins. Done.

01:20:01.214 --> 01:20:02.299
You know...

01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:04.634
The truth is...

01:20:05.218 --> 01:20:06.803
It wasn't about Eric.

01:20:09.890 --> 01:20:11.308
Truth is...

01:20:13.894 --> 01:20:15.395
You know, I just

01:20:15.562 --> 01:20:17.481
love crushing turtles.

01:20:30.994 --> 01:20:32.120
Fuck! Ahhh!

01:20:52.557 --> 01:20:54.017
Just fucking die!

01:21:01.233 --> 01:21:04.319
I like turtles,
you dick!

01:21:21.753 --> 01:21:23.296
Johnny, Richie's dead!

01:21:23.463 --> 01:21:25.298
The guy you are
calling is dead. Sorry.

01:21:25.465 --> 01:21:28.718
What? Hello? Hello?

01:21:29.261 --> 01:21:31.388
Super-good.

01:21:31.555 --> 01:21:32.681
Super-good.

01:21:39.104 --> 01:21:40.605
It's not that
I'm angry with you.

01:21:41.940 --> 01:21:43.358
It's just that I'm...

01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:45.068
Disappointed.

01:21:46.403 --> 01:21:48.280
I'm gonna take you out
into the desert.

01:21:48.363 --> 01:21:50.323
I'm gonna dose
you up on something

01:21:50.490 --> 01:21:52.367
really, really special.

01:21:52.742 --> 01:21:55.829
And we're gonna reprogram
this shit outta your brain.

01:21:55.996 --> 01:21:57.247
Too late for that.

01:22:02.127 --> 01:22:03.169
This is bad.

01:22:24.691 --> 01:22:27.152
Babe? You here?

01:22:32.449 --> 01:22:34.534
Where the fuck is Johnny?

01:22:34.701 --> 01:22:37.621
And why do you have his phone?
Okay.

01:22:37.787 --> 01:22:40.123
Ah, he told me to
tell you that he, um,

01:22:40.290 --> 01:22:42.459
wanted to go to Canada to visit
his girlfriend. They met online.

01:22:42.542 --> 01:22:44.222
She designs jewelry.
She seems super-sweet.

01:22:44.294 --> 01:22:46.463
Shut the fuck up!
Shut up! Where is he?

01:22:46.630 --> 01:22:47.672
Okay.

01:22:47.881 --> 01:22:48.965
Okay.

01:22:49.966 --> 01:22:51.384
I did kill him.

01:22:51.551 --> 01:22:53.553
I bashed him over the head
with a statue.

01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:55.639
And you're next.

01:22:55.805 --> 01:22:57.057
You, you...

01:22:57.474 --> 01:22:59.851
You're lying.
You're lying!

01:23:05.065 --> 01:23:06.149
Shit!

01:23:06.524 --> 01:23:07.567
Ah! Fuck!

01:23:07.776 --> 01:23:10.654
You fucking bitch!
I'm sorry.

01:23:11.404 --> 01:23:14.282
Did that hurt?
Fuck! My fucking hand!

01:23:22.165 --> 01:23:24.167
I told you
this would happen!

01:23:24.417 --> 01:23:27.045
I told you,
but you didn't listen to me!

01:23:27.128 --> 01:23:28.838
Nobody listens to me!

01:23:29.005 --> 01:23:30.090
God!

01:23:31.091 --> 01:23:32.634
I am a T. Rex!

01:23:32.717 --> 01:23:34.594
I am invincible!

01:23:38.348 --> 01:23:39.974
Oh, well done.

01:23:40.141 --> 01:23:41.643
This is great.
Thanks for this.

01:23:41.810 --> 01:23:44.854
Yeah. This isn't exactly

01:23:45.021 --> 01:23:46.648
how I saw the day going.

01:23:46.731 --> 01:23:47.732
Really?

01:23:51.611 --> 01:23:54.447
I promised Martha
I wouldn't kill anybody.

01:23:55.115 --> 01:23:56.616
Oh, that's a relief.

01:23:58.118 --> 01:23:59.452
I'll tell you what...

01:23:59.619 --> 01:24:01.788
Francis, I might not
be the good guy...

01:24:02.372 --> 01:24:03.873
Or whatever,
but it takes one to know one.

01:24:03.957 --> 01:24:04.999
You know what I mean?

01:24:05.458 --> 01:24:06.960
I mean, look at you.

01:24:07.293 --> 01:24:10.714
You look like a fucking
psychopath right now.

01:24:10.964 --> 01:24:14.050
You think you're just gonna walk
out of this life and settle down?

01:24:15.135 --> 01:24:18.388
You'll never be normal.

01:24:25.770 --> 01:24:26.771
Hey!

01:24:28.481 --> 01:24:29.482
Hey!

01:24:30.108 --> 01:24:32.652
Who the fuck wants
to be normal anyway?

01:24:32.819 --> 01:24:35.155
Hey, turn around,
you daft cunt!

01:24:35.822 --> 01:24:36.906
Francis!

01:24:37.699 --> 01:24:39.739
You're gonna make me
shoot you in the back, are you?

01:24:40.493 --> 01:24:43.413
The truth is,
you got boring, Hopper.

01:24:53.757 --> 01:24:55.216
Hey, Steve!

01:24:55.675 --> 01:24:58.595
You all right, buddy?
Yeah, I'm okay now.

01:24:58.762 --> 01:25:00.263
Look at you, man.

01:25:00.430 --> 01:25:03.850
The bounty on Hopper's
like $5 million.

01:25:04.434 --> 01:25:06.936
What? This motherfucker's
worth $5 million?

01:25:07.103 --> 01:25:08.813
I'm rich, bitch!

01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:10.440
Hey, you got any
green ones?

01:25:11.441 --> 01:25:13.276
I saved a couple for you.

01:25:16.529 --> 01:25:18.198
- Thanks, man.
- Hey, dancer.

01:25:18.364 --> 01:25:20.366
Yeah?
Thank you.

01:25:20.784 --> 01:25:22.202
Hey, right on.

01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:25.079
Hey, dummy.

01:25:25.622 --> 01:25:27.457
Hey, baby.
You're all wet.

01:25:27.624 --> 01:25:29.042
I am wet.

01:25:29.125 --> 01:25:31.961
I missed you.
I missed you.

01:25:32.462 --> 01:25:35.381
Where did you get these?
I got 'em from Steve.

01:25:35.548 --> 01:25:38.384
- Steve? Hey, Steve.
- You know Steve?

01:25:38.968 --> 01:25:41.304
Baby, your pupils are super dilated.
Really?

01:25:41.471 --> 01:25:42.931
Did you get shot
in the face?

01:25:43.097 --> 01:25:45.892
Yeah.
I got shot in the face.

01:25:46.059 --> 01:25:47.852
You did?
Yeah.

01:25:48.019 --> 01:25:49.562
Who did that?
I'll bang him.

01:25:49.729 --> 01:25:51.231
No, I banged him.

01:25:51.397 --> 01:25:53.066
I banged him and I banged
the other guy.

01:25:53.233 --> 01:25:55.652
Yeah. I banged them
right in their faces.

01:25:55.819 --> 01:25:58.154
You banged two guys?
I banged two guys!

01:25:58.321 --> 01:26:00.240
That's A-list killing,
Martha!

01:26:00.406 --> 01:26:01.699
That's a clean sweep.

01:26:01.783 --> 01:26:03.503
You got all the guys,
all the main bad guys.

01:26:03.576 --> 01:26:04.786
Yeah?
Yeah.

01:26:04.953 --> 01:26:07.497
You know,
I make shit happen.

01:26:07.872 --> 01:26:10.041
Confidence.
Yeah. Confidence.

01:26:10.208 --> 01:26:13.253
Fucking T. Rex.

01:26:14.587 --> 01:26:15.755
Hey, listen.
Huh?

01:26:15.839 --> 01:26:17.757
We gotta go to
the hospital real bad.

01:26:17.924 --> 01:26:19.008
Okay.

01:26:24.180 --> 01:26:26.933
Okay. Let's go. Let's go.
You're right, you're right.

01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:29.686
Hey, Steve,
can you give us a ride?

01:26:52.625 --> 01:26:54.065
Where do you
wanna go first?

01:26:54.127 --> 01:26:56.045
Oh, don't make me choose.
You know I'm so bad at this.

01:26:56.212 --> 01:26:58.965
I'm so indecisive it's like torture.
Okay.

01:26:59.299 --> 01:27:02.051
All right, I'll tell you what.
I got a plan. Oh, yeah?

01:27:02.635 --> 01:27:03.887
Jalapeno...

01:27:04.053 --> 01:27:05.722
We go to Thailand...

01:27:05.889 --> 01:27:08.141
For the Allosaurus dig.
Lime...

01:27:08.308 --> 01:27:10.727
We go to Brazil
for the pterodactyls.

01:27:12.979 --> 01:27:14.981
Whichever one you pick,

01:27:15.064 --> 01:27:16.816
that's the one
you really wanted.

01:27:21.988 --> 01:27:23.740
Targets in sight.

01:27:24.032 --> 01:27:26.743
Snatch and grab as soon
as they leave the market.

01:27:26.910 --> 01:27:29.412
<i>Copy that.
Alpha Team in position.</i>

01:27:31.164 --> 01:27:34.250
Oh, jalapeÃ±o!
I'm really happy.

01:27:34.417 --> 01:27:36.252
You want a...
I wanted it to be the jalapeÃ±o.

01:27:36.419 --> 01:27:38.379
Thailand? All right, Thailand it is.
Yeah.

01:27:38.546 --> 01:27:39.923
He's got nowhere to go.

01:27:40.089 --> 01:27:41.609
<i>Echo Team,
prepare for lockdown.</i>

01:27:43.843 --> 01:27:45.511
<i>Target has
something in his hand.</i>

01:27:45.678 --> 01:27:47.055
Wait.
<i>Could be a weapon.</i>

01:27:47.221 --> 01:27:48.981
What's he doing?
<i>Echo Team, what can you see?</i>

01:27:49.015 --> 01:27:50.350
What's he doing?
<i>Echo Team,</i>

01:27:50.433 --> 01:27:52.685
<i>we've lost visual contact
with the female target.</i>

01:27:52.810 --> 01:27:55.021
We've been spotted.
Shit! Where's the girl?

01:27:55.188 --> 01:27:57.348
Who's got eyes on the girl?
Where the fuck is the girl?

01:27:58.691 --> 01:28:00.234
Oh, shit.

01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:01.527
Whatcha looking at?

01:28:04.030 --> 01:28:06.532
<i>You-you-you're
Just my type</i>

01:28:08.242 --> 01:28:11.120
<i>Oh, you got a pulse
And you are breathing</i>

01:28:12.789 --> 01:28:15.375
<i>You-you-you're
Just my type</i>

01:28:16.376 --> 01:28:19.295
<i>Ooh, I think it's time
That we get leaving</i>

01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:23.383
<i>You-you-you're
Just my type</i>

01:28:24.884 --> 01:28:27.595
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh!</i>

01:28:29.097 --> 01:28:31.599
<i>When there's lovin'
In the air</i>

01:28:33.726 --> 01:28:35.687
Son of a bitch!

01:28:37.230 --> 01:28:40.566
<i>I can't help myself
But stare</i>

01:28:41.401 --> 01:28:44.112
<i>Double check for
Double meanings</i>

01:28:45.405 --> 01:28:51.494
<i>I'm a man who's got
very specific taste</i>

01:28:53.454 --> 01:28:55.999
<i>You-you-you're
Just my type</i>

01:28:57.583 --> 01:28:59.043
Ah! What the fuck?

01:29:01.587 --> 01:29:04.173
<i>You-you-you're
Just my type</i>

01:29:05.174 --> 01:29:08.720

<i>Ooh, I got you in my sight</i>

01:30:30.676 --> 01:30:32.845
<i>Aiming for Mr. Right</i>

01:30:32.929 --> 01:30:34.305
<i>You're my target</i>

01:30:34.388 --> 01:30:36.808
<i>Don't you dare put up a fight</i>

01:30:36.891 --> 01:30:38.434
<i>This is a love game</i>

01:30:38.518 --> 01:30:40.645
<i>You're driving me insane</i>

01:30:40.728 --> 01:30:43.689
<i>I just want to go
bang, bang, bang, bang</i>

01:30:43.773 --> 01:30:45.566
<i>One, I'll pull your trigger</i>

01:30:45.650 --> 01:30:47.652
<i>Two, down goes the zipper</i>

01:30:47.735 --> 01:30:49.403
<i>Ooh, I'm top shelf liquor</i>

01:30:49.487 --> 01:30:51.405
