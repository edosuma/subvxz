THERE ARE OBVIOUS EXAMPLES OF

00:17.283 --> 00:24.190
THE NEW TALIBAN CONTROL
EVERYWHERE, AND SIGNS OF A
COUNTRY IN CRISIS.
BUT, WE WERE SURPRISED TO HEAR

00:24.257 --> 00:31.531
FROM AID WORKERS THAT THEY ARE
IN REGULAR NEGOTIATION WITH THE
TALIBAN, AS THEY TRY TO HELP THE
MOST VULNERABLE AFGHANS.

00:31.598 --> 00:36.503
WHEN YOU SAY YOU HAVE TO,
YOU KNOW, REACH OUT TO THE
TALIBAN AND TALK TO THEM,
HOW DOES THAT WORK, AS A WOMAN?

ALL OF THAT ONLY MAKES UP ABOUT

PULLED UP STAKES IN AFGHANISTAN
THIS PAST AUGUST, THE BIDEN
ADMINISTRATION DIDN'T EXPECT THE

02:08.862 --> 02:15.301
TALIBAN TO SEIZE CONTROL OF THE
COUNTRY SO QUICKLY.
20 YEARS OF NATION-BUILDING, AND
AN AFGHAN MILITARY, CRUMBLED

02:15.368 --> 02:22.442
WITHIN DAYS.
TO CONTAIN THE TALIBAN'S POWER,
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
ACTED QUICKLY-- FREEZING AFGHAN

02:22.509 --> 02:30.083
ASSETS, SHUTTING DOWN FOREIGN
AID, AND EXTENDING SANCTIONS.
NOW, THE COUNTRY IS FACING
MASS STARVATION, AND ECONOMIC

02:30.149 --> 02:35.655
COLLAPSE.
WE WENT TO AFGHANISTAN;
REPORTED FROM ITS PROVINCES
AND CAPITAL; AND HAD A

02:35.722 --> 02:41.027
RARE CONVERSATION WITH A
TALIBAN MINISTER.
WE ALSO MET WITH HUMANITARIAN
GROUPS, WHO HAVE BEEN LEFT TO

02:41.094 --> 02:52.472
PICK UP THE PIECES, WHILE
NEGOTIATING WITH THE TALIBAN.
AS OUR TEAM ARRIVED IN TO THE
KABUL AIRPORT IN AFGHANISTAN, WE

02:52.539 --> 03:02.448
WEREN'T SURE WHAT WE'D FIND.
(<i> CHAOS</i> )
IT WAS JUST FOUR MONTHS AGO THAT
THE WORLD WATCHED AS SCENES OF

03:02.515 --> 03:10.890
UNFORGETTABLE DESPERATION AND
CHAOS PLAYED OUT HERE AFTER THE
TALIBAN SEIZED CONTROL.
(<i> CHAOS</i> )

03:10.957 --> 03:17.864
THE LUCKY ESCAPED.
BUT, FOR THE 38 MILLION
AFGHANS THAT REMAIN, THE
ANGUISH CONTINUES.

03:17.931 --> 03:26.239
RIGHT AWAY, WE SAW THEIR
NEW REALITY.
ARMED TALIBAN FORCES ARE
EVERYWHERE.

03:26.306 --> 03:32.345
WE NOTICED MANY OF THEM HAVE
ABANDONED THEIR TRADITIONAL
TURBANS, AND NOW WEAR THE
UNIFORMS AND GEAR THAT WESTERN

03:32.412 --> 03:42.488
FORCES LEFT BEHIND.
WE SEE WOMEN AND CHILDREN
DODGING TRAFFIC TO BEG FOR CASH,
AND MEN WAITING IN LONG LINES

03:42.555 --> 03:48.494
FOR FREE FOOD.
>> Mary-Ellen McGroarty: I'VE
BEEN WITH W.F.P. FOR A LONG
TIME, 20-PLUS YEARS, AND I'VE

03:48.561 --> 03:55.134
NEVER SEEN A CRISIS UNFOLD AND
ESCALATE AT THE PACE AND SCALE
THAT WE ARE SEEING.
>> Alfonsi: MARY-ELLEN McGROARTY

03:55.201 --> 04:02.575
IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE UNITED
NATIONS WORLD FOOD PROGRAM IN
AFGHANISTAN.
FROM ITS WAREHOUSE IN KABUL,

04:02.642 --> 04:10.383
SHE'S OVERSEEN THE DELIVERY
OF OVER 117 TONS OF FOOD TO
NEARLY NINE MILLION AFGHANS
SINCE AUGUST.

04:10.450 --> 04:16.222
SHE EXPLAINED TO US WHY THE
COUNTRY IS NOW FACING MASS
STARVATION.
>> McGroarty: 72% OF THE

04:16.289 --> 04:21.628
POPULATION WERE ALREADY LIVING
BELOW THE POVERTY LINE BEFORE
ALL THIS-- BEFORE THE FALL OF
THE GOVERNMENT.

04:21.694 --> 04:26.132
>> Alfonsi: AND NOW, WHAT IS THE
NEED LIKE?
>> McGroarty: AND NOW IT'S JUST
STAGGERING.

04:26.199 --> 04:33.773
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE 22.8 MILLION
PEOPLE IN WHAT WE CALL "SEVERE
FOOD INSECURITY."
>> Alfonsi: THAT'S MORE THAN

04:33.840 --> 04:39.312
HALF THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW.
>> McGroarty: THAT IS MORE THAN
HALF THE COUNTRY.
PEOPLE DON'T HAVE JOBS.

04:39.379 --> 04:45.852
THEY CAN'T ACCESS CASH.
YOU KNOW, FOOD PRICES ARE
GOING UP.
THE CURRENCY IS DEPRECIATING.

04:45.918 --> 04:53.059
SO, FOR US, WE'RE NOW REALLY IN
A RACE AGAINST TIME.
>> Alfonsi: RAVAGED BY WAR,
DROUGHT, COVID, AND THE

04:53.126 --> 05:03.069
ECONOMIC CRASH THAT FOLLOWED THE
TALIBAN TAKEOVER, AFGHANISTAN IS
ON THE VERGE OF COLLAPSE.
ACCORDING TO UNICEF, ONE MILLION

05:03.136 --> 05:11.377
CHILDREN IN AFGHANISTAN ARE NOW
AT RISK OF DYING OF STARVATION,
INSIDE THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL
IN KABUL, THE BEDS WERE FULL,

05:11.444 --> 05:21.587
AND ROOMS QUIET.
THIS MOTHER TOLD US HER FIVE-
MONTH-OLD DAUGHTER WAS STARVING.
SHE WEIGHS JUST SEVEN POUNDS.

05:21.654 --> 05:26.926
DOCTORS SAY ALL OF THE CHILDREN
IN THIS ROOM ARE SUFFERING FROM
MALNUTRITION.
THEY CAN'T OFFER THEM MEDICINE,

05:26.993 --> 05:32.799
BECAUSE THEY'VE RUN OUT.
THEY CAN'T OFFER THEM FOOD,
BECAUSE EVEN THE HOSPITAL
DOESN'T HAVE ANY.

05:32.865 --> 05:38.871
NONE OF THE STAFF HERE HAS BEEN
PAID IN FOUR MONTHS.
THE HOSPITAL HAD BEEN SUPPORTED
BY INTERNATIONAL AID-- THAT

05:38.938 --> 05:49.048
WAS CUT OFF WHEN THE TALIBAN
TOOK OVER.
30 YEARS AGO, THE TALIBAN
FIRST ROSE TO POWER AFTER A

05:49.115 --> 05:55.555
TEN-YEAR WAR WITH THE SOVIETS
AND THE COLLAPSE OF THE
COUNTRY'S COMMUNIST REGIME.
ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS, THEY RULED

05:55.621 --> 06:02.795
WITH AN IRON FIST, BANISHING
WOMEN FROM THE WORK-PLACE,
SCHOOLS, AND PUBLIC LIFE--
EXECUTING THOSE WHO DIDN'T

06:02.862 --> 06:10.636
FOLLOW THEIR STRICT LAWS.
TODAY, THERE ARE WOMEN ON THE
STREETS, BUT NOT MANY.
WHEN THE TAIBAN MARCHED INTO

06:10.703 --> 06:17.376
KABUL, THEY URGED WOMEN TO
STAY HOME UNTIL THEY TAUGHT
THEIR FIGHTERS "HOW TO DEAL WITH
THEM."

06:17.443 --> 06:23.483
WHICH MAKES WHAT MARY-ELLEN
McGROARTY IS DOING EVEN MORE
SURPRISING.
SHE'S BEEN<i> PERSONALLY</i>

06:23.549 --> 06:28.721
NEGOTIATING WITH THE TALIBAN,
SO HER DRIVERS CAN DELIVER FOOD
TO THE NEEDY.
WHEN YOU SAY YOU HAVE TO,

06:28.788 --> 06:33.426
YOU KNOW, REACH OUT TO THE
TALIBAN, AND TALK TO THEM,
HOW DOES THAT WORK, AS A WOMAN?
>> McGroarty: BEING A WOMAN IN

06:33.493 --> 06:43.102
AFGHANISTAN AT THE MOMENT, IS,
YEAH, IT'S CHALLENGING.
BUT I THINK THEY REALIZE I'M THE
HEAD OF A U.N. ORGANIZATION, SO

06:43.169 --> 06:49.609
THEY DO HAVE TO MEET WITH ME.
AND THAT'S THE WAY IT IS.
>> Alfonsi: AND FOR THE PERSON
SITTING AT HOME, WHO SAYS,

06:49.675 --> 06:54.847
"WELL, HOW COULD THEY BE
ENGAGING WITH THE TALIBAN?
THEY'RE AN EXTREMIST GROUP,"
HOW DO YOU ANSWER THAT?

06:54.914 --> 07:01.687
>> McGroarty: WITH HUMANITARIAN
WORK, YOU KNOW, THE HUMANITY
COMES FIRST, AND BEING ABLE TO
SAVE LIVES COMES FIRST.

07:01.754 --> 07:09.128
WE REMAIN IMPARTIAL, WITH A
CLEAR FOCUS ON THE HUMANITARIAN
IMPERATIVE.
>> Alfonsi: McGROARTY TOLD US

07:09.195 --> 07:15.234
HUMANITARIAN GROUPS HAVE WORKED
WITH THE TALIBAN FOR MUCH OF THE
LAST DECADE.
THEY HAD TO-- BECAUSE EVEN WHEN

07:15.301 --> 07:23.342
THERE WAS A DEMOCRATICALLY-
ELECTED GOVERNMENT SITTING IN
KABUL, THE TALIBAN CONTROLLED
60% TO 70% OF THE COUNTRY.

07:23.409 --> 07:30.349
MANUEL FONTAINE, A DIRECTOR FOR
UNICEF, FIRST CAME TO
AFGHANISTAN AFTER 9/11.
HE EXPLAINED HOW THEIR

07:30.416 --> 07:36.522
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE TALIBAN
HAS EVOLVED OVER THE YEARS.
HAS THE TALIBAN SAID TO YOU,
"WE WANT YOU HERE.

07:36.589 --> 07:40.226
WE NEED YOU HERE.
HELP US"?
>> Manuel Fontaine: YES.
ABSOLUTELY.

07:40.293 --> 07:44.831
FROM THE BEGINNING.
AND WE'VE SAID FROM THE
BEGINNING THAT WE WILL BE
UNCOMPROMISING WHEN IT COMES

07:44.897 --> 07:50.970
TO GIRLS' EDUCATION, WHEN IT
COMES TO MAKING SURE THAT WOMEN
CAN WORK.
>> Alfonsi: SINCE AUGUST 15,

07:51.037 --> 07:59.145
HAVE THEY BEEN MORE OR LESS
RECEPTIVE TO WHAT YOU HAVE
TO SAY, AND WHAT OTHER N.G.O.s
HAVE TO SAY?

07:59.212 --> 08:04.917
>> Fontaine: THEY ARE RECEPTIVE
NOW, IN THE SENSE THAT THEY
REALIZE THAT WITH POWER COMES
THE RESPONSIBILITY TO DO

08:04.984 --> 08:10.756
SOMETHING FOR THE POPULATION OF
AFGHANISTAN.
THEY REALIZE THEY HAVE THAT
RESPONSIBILITY, AND IN THAT

08:10.823 --> 08:15.695
SENSE, THEY'RE WILLING TO HAVE
THOSE DISCUSSIONS.
>> Alfonsi: BECAUSE OF THOSE
DISCUSSIONS, UNICEF IS NOW ABLE

08:15.761 --> 08:22.802
TO ACCESS COMMUNITIES PREVIOUSLY
OFF-LIMITS.
WE TRAVELED WITH THEM, AND THEIR
GOVERNMENT-MANDATED TALIBAN

08:22.869 --> 08:30.910
ESCORTS, TO ONE OF THOSE PLACES.
SO, WE ARE IN WARDAK PROVINCE,
WHICH IS ABOUT TWO HOURS FROM
KABUL, AND THE REASON THAT THIS

08:30.977 --> 08:38.885
ROAD IS SO BUMPY IS BECAUSE
THERE WERE SO MANY I.E.D.s HERE.
THIS WAS A TALIBAN STRONGHOLD
FOR ABOUT A DECADE, SO GROUPS

08:38.951 --> 08:47.827
LIKE THE U.N. WOULD NEVER HAVE
DREAMED OF COMING OUT HERE.
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME UNICEF
HAD BEEN TO THIS RURAL AREA IN

08:47.894 --> 08:54.867
12 YEARS.
AND THE FIRST TIME THEY
WERE ABLE TO LAY EYES ON ONE OF
THE RESULTS OF THEIR

08:54.934 --> 09:06.646
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE TALIBAN:
THIS COMMUNITY-BASED SCHOOL FOR
GIRLS.
FOR HOW MANY OF YOU GIRLS IS

09:06.712 --> 09:18.724
THIS YOUR FIRST YEAR AT SCHOOL?
RAISE YOUR HAND.
THE YOUNGEST GIRL HERE IS SIX.
THE OLDEST, 12.

09:18.791 --> 09:25.164
MANY OF THEM TOLD US THEY HOPED
TO BE DOCTORS.
THE SCHOOL-- AND 4,500 LIKE
THEM-- OPERATE WITH THE

09:25.231 --> 09:31.337
TALIBAN'S BLESSING.
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?
THIS WAS A PROVINCE THAT WAS
CONTROLLED BY THE TALIBAN FOR A

09:31.404 --> 09:37.777
DECADE.
HOW DO YOU GET TO THEM AND SAY,
WE WANT TO HAVE A SCHOOL HERE?
>> Fontaine: TALKING TO THEM,

09:37.843 --> 09:42.048
EXPLAINING THE DIFFERENCE IT
MAKES.
THE DISCUSSIONS WE'RE HAVING
WITH THE TALIBAN DON'T START

09:42.114 --> 09:47.019
FROM SCRATCH.
THAT CONFIDENCE WAS BUILT OVER
THE YEARS.
IN THE AREAS THEY CONTROLLED,

09:47.086 --> 09:52.959
THAT TRUST HAS STARTED TO BUILD.
>> Alfonsi: WHAT WE SAW IN THAT
SCHOOL WAS HEART-WARMING.
BUT, WE KNOW THERE ARE A MILLION

09:53.025 --> 09:58.798
GIRLS IN HIGH SCHOOL WHO ARE NOT
GOING TO SCHOOL.
WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE NO WOMEN
BEING ALLOWED, REALLY, TO ATTEND

09:58.864 --> 10:04.837
COLLEGE IN ANY WAY.
ARE YOU MAKING ANY GROUND IN
THAT AREA?
>> Fontaine: WE ARE MAKING SOME

10:04.904 --> 10:09.408
GROUND, BUT NOT ENOUGH.
THAT'S OBVIOUS.
WHAT WE HEAR FROM TALIBAN IS
THAT THEY WANT TO DO IT IN A WAY

10:09.475 --> 10:16.315
THAT IS KEEPING WITH THE CULTURE
OF THE COUNTRY.
SO, WE NEED TO FIND A WAY TO DO
THAT.

10:16.382 --> 10:23.055
THIS COUNTRY NEEDS EVERYBODY'S
STRENGTH.
AFTER MONTHS OF NEGOTIATIONS,
WE WERE GRANTED ACCESS TO

10:23.122 --> 10:31.030
MEET DR. QALANDAR EBAD, THE
NEWLY-APPOINTED HEALTH MINISTER
OF THE TALIBAN.
A 41-YEAR-OLD PHYSICIAN, HE WAS

10:31.097 --> 10:41.207
EDUCATED IN PAKISTAN.
WE WERE A LITTLE UNEASY WHEN
HE INVITED US TO EAT WITH HIM
AND OTHER TALIBAN LEADERS IN

10:41.273 --> 10:46.879
THE BASEMENT OF ONE OF THEIR
BUILDINGS.
HE AGREED TO SPEAK TO US ABOUT
THE HEALTH CRISIS FACING THE

10:46.946 --> 10:54.420
COUNTRY, BUT HE TOLD US, HE
DIDN'T WANT TO DISCUSS POLITICS.
TALIBAN GUNMEN KEPT WATCH OVER
THE INTERVIEW.

10:54.487 --> 11:02.595
SOME OF THE HUMANITARIAN WORKERS
WE SPOKE TO SAID THAT THE
COUNTRY IS ON THE VERGE OF ITS
WORST HUMANITARIAN CRISIS EVER.

11:02.661 --> 11:10.603
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT TO BE TRUE?
>> Dr. Qalandar Ebad: WE ARE ON
THE EDGE OF THIS CRISIS.
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT THE FUNDS

11:10.669 --> 11:17.743
ARE FREEZED BY THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY.
I THINK THEY CAN UNFREEZE THE
FUNDS FOR THE HEALTH SECTOR OF

11:17.810 --> 11:24.650
AFGHANISTAN.
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE
NEED OF THE TIME.
>> Alfonsi: THE INTERNATIONAL

11:24.717 --> 11:31.057
COMMUNITY HAS SPOKEN PRETTY
CLEARLY, AND SAID THEY'RE
"NOT GOING TO UNFREEZE FUNDS
UNLESS THERE'S A GUARANTEE THAT

11:31.123 --> 11:37.863
ALL GIRLS WILL BE EDUCATED IN
AFGHANISTAN."
IS THE TALIBAN WILLING TO
CONSIDER ANY KIND OF MOVEMENT IN

11:37.930 --> 11:47.440
THAT AREA?
>> Dr. Ebad: I THINK IT'S A
POLITICAL ISSUE.
EDUCATION IS A SEPARATE CHAPTER

11:47.506 --> 11:57.249
AND DEPARTMENT, AND HEALTH IS A
DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT.
>> Alfonsi: WHAT I HEAR YOU
SAYING IS, YOU WANT TO KEEP

11:57.316 --> 12:01.287
HEALTH SEPARATE FROM THE IDEA OF
EDUCATION.
>> Dr. Ebad: YEAH.
WHY THEY ARE MIXING THE TWO

12:01.353 --> 12:05.091
DIFFERENT TOPICS--
>> Alfonsi: WELL, BECAUSE I
THINK THE IDEA THAT, YOU KNOW,
EDUCATING WOMEN IS GOOD FOR THE

12:05.157 --> 12:12.698
HEALTH OF THE COUNTRY.
>> Dr. Ebad: YES.
THERE'S NO DOUBT.
>> Alfonsi: BUT THE MINISTER

12:12.765 --> 12:18.971
WOULD NOT GO FURTHER ON
CONCESSIONS OR GIRL'S HIGH
SCHOOL AND UNIVERSITY EDUCATION.
NINE DAYS AGO, THE TALIBAN

12:19.038 --> 12:26.712
ISSUED A DECREE BANNING BOTH
FORCED MARRIAGE AND TREATING
WOMEN AS PROPERTY, BUT THERE
WAS NO MENTION OF ALLOWING WOMEN

12:26.779 --> 12:35.421
TO WORK OUTSIDE THE HOME.
SOON AFTER, THE WORLD BANK
RELEASED $280 MILLION IN AID FOR
AFGHANISTAN-- A SMALL PORTION OF

12:35.488 --> 12:42.528
THE $1.5 BILLION FROZEN BY THE
WORLD BANK.
VICKI AKEN HAS LED THE
U.S.-BASED INTERNATIONAL

12:42.595 --> 12:49.635
RESCUE COMMITTEE IN AFGHANISTAN
FOR FOUR YEARS.
>> Vicki Aken: WE NEED TO FIGURE
OUT A SYSTEM FOR CONTINUING TO

12:49.702 --> 12:58.410
SUPPORT JUST BASIC SERVICES LIKE
EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE.
THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT, 75% OF
THEIR BUDGET, YOU KNOW, WAS

12:58.477 --> 13:08.320
FUNDED BY DEVELOPMENT DONORS.
>> Alfonsi: 75% OF THE
GOVERNMENT BUDGET WAS FUNDED BY
DONATIONS?

13:08.387 --> 13:17.029
AND SO HEALTH CARE, EDUCATION
HAVE DRIED UP.
>> Aken: YEAH, AND THERE'S STILL
NO CLEAR WAY FORWARD.

13:17.096 --> 13:23.869
>> Alfonsi: HER STAFF OF 1,200,
MOSTLY LOCALS, INTERVIEW
FAMILIES IN THE NEEDIEST
NEIGHBORHOODS.

13:23.936 --> 13:31.043
THAT'S HOW THEY FOUND HOMIRA.
19 YEARS OLD, SHE FLED EASTERN
AFGHANISTAN THREE MONTHS AGO
WITH HER TWO CHILDREN.

13:31.110 --> 13:38.284
WHAT KIND OF CHALLENGES HAVE YOU
FACED?
>> Homira (<i> translated</i> ): I
FACED A LOT OF PROBLEMS.

13:38.350 --> 13:43.155
I COULDN'T SUPPORT MY CHILDREN,
TO BUY SOMETHING LIKE FOOD OR
CLOTHES.
>> Alfonsi: THE INTERNATIONAL

13:43.222 --> 13:49.595
RESCUE COMMITTEE GAVE HER ABOUT
$400 TO GET BLANKETS AND FOOD
FOR WINTER.
BUT, THEY ARE FEARFUL THEIR

13:49.662 --> 13:58.671
FUNDS COULD RUN OUT.
IF THE AID WASN'T HERE, WHAT
WOULD THAT MEAN TO YOUR FAMILY?
IF THERE WASN'T THIS HELP?

13:58.737 --> 14:05.644
>> Homira (<i> translated</i> ): I
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT MY
FAMILY OR CHILDREN.
I'M REALLY THANKFUL FOR THEM.

14:05.711 --> 14:12.518
>> Alfonsi: WHAT DOES $400 MEAN
TO A FAMILY IN THIS MOMENT?
>> Aken: IT MEANS EVERYTHING, IN
THIS MOMENT.

14:12.585 --> 14:24.563
I MEAN, WE SEE A LOT OF CASES
WHERE PEOPLE MIGHT SEND THEIR
CHILDREN OFF TO WORK, INCLUDING
AS YOUNG AS FIVE OR SIX.

14:24.630 --> 14:30.169
YOU KNOW, THEY MIGHT SELL THEIR
DAUGHTERS INTO MARRIAGE.
AND IT'S--
AND I KNOW IT SOUNDS HORRENDOUS.

14:30.236 --> 14:39.245
BUT WHEN YOU HAVE A FAMILY OF,
SAY, EIGHT PEOPLE, AND YOU
HAVE NO MEANS TO FEED EVERYONE,
AND THEY SEE THAT AS THEIR ONLY

14:39.311 --> 14:46.051
OPTION...
>> Alfonsi: HUMANITARIAN LEADERS
SAY, WITHOUT SWIFT ACTION,
MORE PEOPLE IN AFGHANISTAN COULD

14:46.118 --> 14:53.125
DIE OF HUNGER NEXT YEAR THAN
FROM THE VIOLENCE OF THE PAST
20 YEARS OF WAR.
>> Aken: IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT

14:53.192 --> 14:59.131
THE EFFECT OF SANCTIONS HAVE
BEEN, THEY'RE REALLY HURTING
THE PEOPLE OF AFGHANISTAN MORE
THAN THEY'RE HURTING ANYONE IN

14:59.198 --> 15:08.574
THE TALIBAN.
THE TALIBAN HAVE HAD SANCTIONS
ON THEM FOR QUITE SOME TIME,
AND THEY'VE ALWAYS MANAGED TO

15:08.641 --> 15:14.913
SURVIVE THOSE SANCTIONS.
BUT NOW THEY HAVE TO RUN A
GOVERNMENT.
>> Alfonsi: I THINK A LOT OF

15:14.980 --> 15:20.519
PEOPLE WILL SAY, "WELL, WE
DON'T WANT TO SEE AID GO TO
AFGHANISTAN, BECAUSE WE DON'T
WANT TO GIVE MONEY TO THE

15:20.586 --> 15:26.925
TALIBAN.
THAT'S AN EXTREMIST GROUP."
>> Aken: SO YOU WANT TO MAKE
38 MILLION PEOPLE SUFFER BECAUSE

15:26.992 --> 15:38.504
OF A FEW THOUSAND?
THAT MATH DOESN'T WORK FOR ME.
(<i> TICKING</i> )

TELESCOPE-- THE LARGEST AND MOST
EXPENSIVE INSTRUMENT EVER FLOWN.
100 TIMES MORE POWERFUL THAN THE

16:12.404 --> 16:21.814
31-YEAR-OLD HUBBLE TELESCOPE,
WEBB CAN SEE BACK IN TIME,
ALL THE WAY TO THE "LET THERE

16:21.880 --> 16:32.391
WHEN A COLD, DARK UNIVERSE
IGNITED INTO STARS.
WOW.
WELL, SOMEHOW, THAT'S A LOT

16:32.458 --> 16:38.530
BIGGER THAN I IMAGINED.
>> Amy Lo: SHE'S A BIG ONE.
>> Pelley: A YEAR AGO, WE
WERE AMONG THE LAST HUMANS TO

16:38.597 --> 16:46.004
SEE THE TELESCOPE MUCH AS IT
WILL APPEAR IN SPACE.
AFTER OUR VISIT, IT WAS
PACKED AWAY FOR A JOURNEY OF A

16:46.071 --> 16:55.714
MILLION MILES, FAR BEYOND THE
MOON, TO LIE FOREVER IN THE
GRASP OF THE SUN.
THE OPERATING LIFE IS HOW LONG?

16:55.781 --> 17:04.990
>> Lo: IT'S DESIGNED FOR 5.5
YEARS, WITH A GOAL OF TEN YEARS.
SO, THAT MEANS WE CARRY
ENOUGH STUFF ON THERE TO LAST

17:05.057 --> 17:12.398
FOR TEN YEARS.
>> Pelley: AMY LO IS A SYSTEMS
ENGINEER, WHO TOOK US UP IN THE
CLEAN ROOM AT NORTHRUP GRUMMAN

17:12.464 --> 17:19.772
IN REDONDO BEACH, CALIFORNIA.
>> Lo: WE HAD TO INVENT IT,
DESIGN IT, BUILD IT, AND
HAND-PUT IT TOGETHER.

17:19.838 --> 17:26.812
>> Pelley: AT THE BOTTOM OF
THE SPACECRAFT, THAT SILVER
SHROUD IS A PARASOL, BIG AS A
TENNIS COURT, TO SHIELD WEBB

17:26.879 --> 17:35.387
FROM THE SUN.
ABOVE, THERE ARE 21 FEET OF
GOLD-PLATED MIRRORS, SIX TIMES
BIGGER THAN HUBBLE'S MIRROR, TO

17:35.454 --> 17:42.861
CATCH THE EARLIEST STAR LIGHT IN
CREATION.
THERE ARE 18 OF THESE HEXAGONAL
MIRRORS.

17:42.928 --> 17:49.668
BUT WHEN YOU FOLD THEM OUT,
THEY ALL WORK IN CONCERT AS
ONE MIRROR?
>> Lo: THAT'S RIGHT.

17:49.735 --> 17:58.243
ALL 18 IMAGES WILL FORM ONE VERY
NICE, SOLID IMAGE.
>> Pelley: THAT IMAGE WOULD BE
INVISIBLE TO THE HUMAN EYE.

17:58.310 --> 18:06.952
LIKE A NIGHT VISION CAMERA,
WEBB IS DESIGNED TO SEE HEAT--
INFRARED LIGHT-- BECAUSE THAT'S
THE ONLY SIGNATURE LEFT FROM THE

18:07.019 --> 18:17.596
STARS AT THE EDGE OF TIME.
EVEN THAT GLOW WILL BE SO DIM,
THE MIRRORS WILL HAVE TO SQUINT
FOR HOURS TO EXPOSE AN IMAGE.

18:17.663 --> 18:26.872
HOW MUCH CONFIDENCE DO YOU HAVE?
>> Lo: YOU KNOW, MY JOB IS TO
WORRY.
I PERSONALLY FEEL CONFIDENT THAT

18:26.939 --> 18:36.849
WE HAVE THOUGHT OF EVERYTHING.
>> Pelley: THINKING OF
EVERYTHING TOOK MORE THAN
25 YEARS AND $10 BILLION.

18:36.915 --> 18:43.422
ENGINEER AMY LO EXPLAINED THE
CHALLENGE.
>> Lo: IN MY MIND, THE BIGGEST
ENGINEERING CHALLENGE WAS TO

18:43.489 --> 18:51.430
BUILD A SUN-SHIELD CAPABLE OF
SHIELDING THE OPTICS, THE
MIRRORS, AND THE INSTRUMENTS ON
WEBB.

18:51.497 --> 18:58.003
HOW DO YOU BUILD SOMETHING BIG,
BUT LIGHTWEIGHT?
>> Pelley: THE SUN-SHIELD KEEPS
WEBB COLD AND DARK.

18:58.070 --> 19:04.910
ANY INFRARED HEAT FROM THE SUN
OR EARTH WOULD BLIND THE
TELESCOPE.
THE FIVE LAYERS ARE MADE OF

19:04.977 --> 19:12.184
GOSSAMER SHEETS, NOT UNLIKE
MYLAR BIRTHDAY BALLOONS.
>> Lo: THE LAYER FACING THE SUN
IS LAYER ONE, AND LAYER ONE

19:12.251 --> 19:18.257
REACHES ABOUT 230 DEGREES
FAHRENHEIT.
SO, A PRETTY WARM OVEN.
LIKE, IF YOU WANTED TO COOK A

19:18.323 --> 19:22.561
MERINGUE, OR SOMETHING.
>> Pelley: AND ON THE TELESCOPE
SIDE?
>> Lo: ON THE TELESCOPE SIDE,

19:22.628 --> 19:30.068
IT GETS TO NEGATIVE 370 DEGREES
FAHRENHEIT.
>> Pelley: THERE'S A ROUGHLY
600-DEGREE DIFFERENCE!

19:30.135 --> 19:34.606
>> Lo: THERE IS.
>> Pelley: BETWEEN ONE SIDE OF
THE HEAT SHIELD AND THE OTHER.
>> Lo: YES, IT'S AMAZING THAT

19:34.673 --> 19:42.548
IT'S ABLE TO DO THIS WITH
NOTHING MORE THAN THESE LAYERS.
>> Pelley: THE ENGINEERING IS
AMAZING.

19:42.614 --> 19:50.289
BUT, THE SCIENCE MAY REVEAL THE
UNIVERSE.
SINCE THE BEGINNING, THE
BIG BANG, THE ARROW OF TIME HAS

19:50.355 --> 20:00.999
FLOWN NEARLY 14 BILLION YEARS.
WEBB MAY SEE ALL THE WAY BACK TO
THE FIRST 100 MILLION--
THE BABY UNIVERSE.

20:01.066 --> 20:08.106
AMBER STRAUGHN IS AN
ASTROPHYSICIST ON THE PROJECT.
>> Amber Straughn: TELESCOPES
REALLY ARE TIME MACHINES.

20:08.173 --> 20:14.246
THEY LITERALLY ALLOW US TO SEE
INTO THE PAST.
AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS
JUST DUE TO THE NATURE OF HOW

20:14.313 --> 20:18.383
LIGHT TRAVELS.
LIGHT FROM THE SUN TAKES
ABOUT EIGHT MINUTES TO GET TO
THE EARTH.

20:18.450 --> 20:24.289
SO, WE'RE SEEING THE SUN AS IT
WAS EIGHT MINUTES AGO.
AND YOU CAN SORT OF THINK ABOUT
STEPPING THAT FURTHER OUT INTO

20:24.356 --> 20:30.662
THE UNIVERSE.
>> Pelley: SO, WHEN WE WALK OUT
UNDER THE STARS, AND LOOK ABOVE
US, WE'RE NOT SEEING THE STARS

20:30.729 --> 20:37.102
AS THEY ARE TODAY.
WE'RE SEEING THEM AS THEY WERE
PERHAPS MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO.
>> Straughn: ABSOLUTELY.

20:37.169 --> 20:42.007
>> Pelley: BECAUSE IT TOOK
THAT LONG FOR THE LIGHT TO REACH
THE EARTH.
>> Straughn: YES, FOR SURE.

20:42.074 --> 20:49.247
>> Pelley: HOW MUCH DO WE KNOW
ABOUT THE UNIVERSE?
>> Straughn: EVERYTHING WE KNOW
ABOUT, EVERYTHING WE CAN SEE,

20:49.314 --> 20:54.453
ME AND YOU, EVERYTHING ON THE
PLANET, ALL THE HUNDREDS OF
BILLIONS OF OTHER GALAXIES--
ALL OF THAT ONLY MAKES UP ABOUT

20:54.519 --> 21:03.595
5% OF THE UNIVERSE.
THE REST OF IT, THAT OTHER 95%,
WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT IS.
>> Pelley: THAT 95%, THE

21:03.662 --> 21:11.336
UNKNOWN, IS ALL AROUND US, LIKE
A GHOST.
NEARLY ALL THE COSMOS IS MADE UP
OF WHAT PHYSICISTS CALL, IN

21:11.403 --> 21:20.412
DESPERATION, "DARK MATTER" AND
"DARK ENERGY."
NEVER SEEN, SCIENTISTS INFER
THEY<i> MUST</i> EXIST, BECAUSE THEY'RE

21:20.479 --> 21:28.854
THE BEST EXPLANATION FOR HOW
GALAXIES FORM AND MOVE.
>> Straughn: SO, WE KNOW THAT
DARK MATTER IS SORT OF THIS

21:28.920 --> 21:36.028
SCAFFOLDING OF THE UNIVERSE.
IT'S THE-- THE STRUCTURE ON
WHICH GALAXIES SIT.
AND IF THERE WASN'T DARK MATTER,

21:36.094 --> 21:41.633
THERE WOULDN'T BE GALAXIES, AND
THERE WOULDN'T BE US.
>> Pelley: WHAT MIGHT THE
WEBB TELESCOPE REVEAL ABOUT

21:41.700 --> 21:46.238
DARK MATTER?
>> Straughn: IT'S LIKE WE HAVE
THIS 14-BILLION-YEAR-OLD STORY
OF THE UNIVERSE, BUT WE'RE

21:46.304 --> 21:54.312
MISSING THAT FIRST CHAPTER.
AND WEBB WAS SPECIFICALLY
DESIGNED TO ALLOW US TO SEE
THOSE VERY FIRST GALAXIES THAT

21:54.379 --> 22:02.521
FORMED AFTER THE BIG BANG.
NOW, GALAXIES ARE BORN AND THEN
THEY EVOLVE, THEY CHANGE, OVER
TIME, AND THIS WAY THAT GALAXIES

22:02.587 --> 22:10.529
CHANGE MUST RELY CRITICALLY ON
DARK MATTER.
AND WEBB IS GOING TO ALLOW US TO
OBSERVE THAT PROCESS OF GALAXY

22:10.595 --> 22:17.602
EVOLUTION IN MUCH MORE DETAIL.
>> Pelley: THE PROMISE OF
DISCOVERY SHIELDED WEBB ON
WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN A

22:17.669 --> 22:25.510
TREACHEROUS JOURNEY.
IT WAS TO LAUNCH SEVEN YEARS
AGO, BUT DELAYS COME WITH A
MACHINE THIS AMBITIOUS.

22:25.577 --> 22:34.119
BECAUSE OF COST OVERRUNS, WEBB
WAS CANCELLED, IN 2011, BY THE
HOUSE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE;
BUT IT WAS SAVED IN THE SENATE.

22:34.186 --> 22:42.961
ITS NAMESAKE IS JAMES WEBB,
HEAD OF NASA IN THE 1960s, WHO
MADE SCIENCE A TOP PRIORITY.
WHAT ARE THE STAKES?

22:43.028 --> 22:47.999
WHAT'S RIDING ON THAT ROCKET
WITH WEBB?
>> Bill Ochs: WHEN YOU TALK
ABOUT WHAT'S AT STAKE, IT REALLY

22:48.066 --> 22:55.774
IS NASA'S REPUTATION, TO TAKE ON
A MISSION THAT IS AS CHALLENGING
AS WEBB AND BE SUCCESSFUL.
>> Pelley: BILL OCHS AND GREG

22:55.841 --> 23:03.415
ROBINSON RUN THE PROGRAM.
OCHS WAS AN ENGINEER ON HUBBLE.
ROBINSON HAS SUPERVISED NASA
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE.

23:03.482 --> 23:09.221
>> Greg Robinson: IF YOU WANT
TO BE BOLD AND GET THE KIND OF
SCIENCE WE'RE AFTER, YOU HAVE TO
MAKE THE INVESTMENT.

23:09.287 --> 23:14.960
AND IT'S GOING TO ANSWER TWO BIG
QUESTIONS FOR ASTROPHYSICS:
WHERE DID WE COME FROM, AND,
ARE WE ALONE?

23:15.026 --> 23:18.897
AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO
GETTING THOSE RESULTS.
>> Pelley: IS WEBB GOING TO
WORK?

23:18.964 --> 23:22.834
>> Robinson: YES, IT'S GOING TO
WORK.
I HAVE VERY HIGH CONFIDENCE.
>> Ochs: I AM 100% CONFIDENT.

23:22.901 --> 23:30.442
>> Pelley: WHY 100% CONFIDENT?
>> Ochs: BECAUSE WHEN I LOOK AT
THE TESTING THAT WE HAVE DONE
OVER THE YEARS, AND THE TYPE OF

23:30.509 --> 23:35.213
ENGINEERING THAT WENT INTO IT,
YOU BUILD A SENSE OF CONFIDENCE
THAT, YOU KNOW THIS IS GOING TO
WORK.

23:35.280 --> 23:39.785
>> Pelley: WHAT ARE YOU MOST
CONCERNED ABOUT?
>> Ochs: UNFOLDING THE ENTIRE
TELESCOPE IS WHAT YOU WORRY

23:39.851 --> 23:47.626
ABOUT.
>> Pelley: THE OBSERVATORY HAD
TO BE FOLDED INTO AN "ARIANE 5"
ROCKET JUST 16 FEET WIDE--

23:47.692 --> 23:55.267
IT'S WRAPPED TODAY TIGHT AS A
ROSE-BUD.
IN FLIGHT, MORE THAN 40 SYSTEMS
MUST BLOSSOM WITH PERFECTION,

23:55.333 --> 24:04.309
INCLUDING AMY LO'S NEVER-
INVENTED-BEFORE SUN-SHIELD.
>> Pelley: ALL FIVE LAYERS WILL
BE FOLDED UP AND HELD IN PLACE

24:04.376 --> 24:11.082
BY PINS.
HOW MANY PINS ARE THERE?
>> Lo: THERE'S 107 OF THESE
MEMBRANE-RELEASE DEVICES AND

24:11.149 --> 24:18.723
PINS, THAT HOLD ALL FIVE LAYERS
PINNED TO THIS STRUCTURE HERE,
CALLED A U.P.S.
ALL TOTAL, 107.

24:18.790 --> 24:24.563
>> Pelley: AND AS YOU'RE
UNFOLDING, HOW MANY OF THOSE CAN
FAIL?
>> Lo: NONE.

24:24.629 --> 24:28.166
>> Pelley: NONE?
>> Lo: NONE.
>> Pelley: NOT ONE?
>> Lo: NOT ONE.

24:28.233 --> 24:36.374
>> Pelley: THERE IS LITERALLY NO
ROOM FOR ERROR.
>> Lo: WE TEST AND WE DO A LOT
OF ANALYSIS TO ENSURE THAT EACH

24:36.441 --> 24:42.647
AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE
WILL RELEASE ON ORBIT.
>> Pelley: $10 BILLION RIDES ON
THOSE PINS.

24:42.714 --> 24:50.488
THE HUBBLE TELESCOPE, 340
MILES UP, COULD BE REACHED WITH
A WRENCH.
WEBB, AT A MILLION MILES, IS

24:50.555 --> 24:57.662
BEYOND REPAIR.
BILL OCHS TOLD US THAT IF
SOMETHING DOES GET STUCK, THERE
IS AN EMERGENCY PLAN.

24:57.729 --> 25:03.635
>> Ochs: WE'VE DEVELOPED
ALGORITHMS TO, ESSENTIALLY,
WE CALL IT "THE SHIMMY."
WE DO A LITTLE SHAKE ON THE

25:03.702 --> 25:08.607
TELESCOPE, AND WE CAN ROCK IT
BACK AND FORTH.
IF THAT DOESN'T WORK, WE HAVE
ANOTHER ONE WE CALL "THE TWIRL,"

25:08.673 --> 25:13.879
WHICH CAN ACTUALLY SPIN THE
TELESCOPE EITHER CLOCKWISE OR
COUNTERCLOCKWISE, TO HELP SHAKE
THINGS LOOSE.

25:13.945 --> 25:17.782
>> Pelley: SO, YOU'RE GOING TO
DO WHAT I DO WITH DEVICES WHEN
THEY'RE NOT WORKING-- YOU'RE
GOING TO SHAKE IT.

25:17.849 --> 25:26.124
>> Ochs: YEAH, YEAH, KIND OF DO
THE SAME THING, YES.
>> Pelley: IF 107 PINS RELEASE,
THE MIRRORS SYNCHRONIZE, AND

25:26.191 --> 25:34.165
10,000 THINGS GO RIGHT, WEBB
WILL BE LIMITED ONLY BY ABOUT
TEN YEARS OF FUEL FOR PIVOTING
AND POINTING.

25:34.232 --> 25:42.507
CANADA CONTRIBUTED THE AIMING
SYSTEM THAT WILL GUIDE WEBB TO
WONDERS FAR AND NEAR.
MORE THAN 1,000 ASTRONOMERS

25:42.574 --> 25:49.180
AROUND THE WORLD ARE COMPETING
FOR TELESCOPE TIME.
HEIDI HAMMEL WAS GRANTED
100 HOURS.

25:49.247 --> 25:57.255
>> Heidi Hammel: I HAVE SO MANY
QUESTIONS.
MY PARTICULAR FOCUS IS OBJECTS
IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM.

25:57.322 --> 26:06.231
>> Pelley: HAMMEL TOLD US THAT
LIGHT IS FULL OF INFORMATION.
WEBB CAN DEFINE THE CHEMISTRY OF
A PLACE BY ANALYZING ITS

26:06.298 --> 26:12.337
WAVELENGTHS OF LIGHT.
>> Hammel: WHAT IS THE
ATMOSPHERIC WATER CONTENT OF
MARS, AND HOW DOES IT CHANGE

26:12.404 --> 26:21.813
WITH TIME?
WHAT DRIVES THE CHEMISTRY IN THE
UPPER ATMOSPHERE OF NEPTUNE?
CAN WE SEE IF THERE'S WATER

26:21.880 --> 26:28.687
COMING OUT OF THE MOONS OF
JUPITER OR SATURN?
THERE ARE JUST AN INFINITE
NUMBER OF QUESTIONS I WANT TO

26:28.753 --> 26:34.125
ANSWER.
>> Pelley: ASTROPHYSICIST
NATALIE BATALHA ALSO HAS TIME ON
WEBB.

26:34.192 --> 26:41.800
SHE'LL BE LOOKING AT PLANETS
BEYOND OUR SOLAR SYSTEM.
>> Natalie Batalha: ON AVERAGE,
EVERY STAR IN THE GALAXY HAS AT

26:41.866 --> 26:46.905
LEAST ONE PLANET.
THAT MEANS THAT THERE ARE
MORE PLANETS IN THE GALAXY THAN
THERE ARE STARS.

26:46.972 --> 26:54.546
HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF PLANETS.
>> Pelley: AND WITH THAT MANY
PLANETS, BATALHA IS SURE
WEBB COULD FIND SOME WITH THE

26:54.612 --> 27:02.721
CHEMISTRY AND CONDITIONS OF
LIFE.
>> Batalha: THERE HAPPENS TO BE
ONE PLANETARY SYSTEM-- THE STAR

27:02.787 --> 27:10.595
HAS SEVEN PLANETS ORBITING IT.
AND THE STAR IS ONLY ABOUT
40 LIGHT YEARS AWAY, SO IT'S A
GREAT TARGET TO STUDY.

27:10.662 --> 27:19.004
AND IT HAS THREE EARTH-SIZED
PLANETS ORBITING IN WHAT I WOULD
CALL THE GOLDILOCKS ZONE, WHERE
LIFE COULD POTENTIALLY EXIST.

27:19.070 --> 27:22.607
>> Pelley: NOT TOO HOT, NOT TOO
COLD.
>> Batalha: THAT'S THE IDEA.
YES.

27:22.674 --> 27:30.281
AND SO, THIS IS ALSO ONE OF THE
VERY FIRST TARGETS THAT WE'RE
GOING TO OBSERVE WITH WEBB.
AND WHAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO SEE

27:30.348 --> 27:36.921
IS, IS THERE CARBON DIOXIDE IN
THE ATMOSPHERE?
WHAT ARE THE GREENHOUSE GASSES?
IS THERE CARBON DIOXIDE IN

27:36.988 --> 27:43.328
COMBINATION WITH METHANE?
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT EARTH HAS.
SO, BY LOOKING AT THESE CHEMICAL
CONSTITUENTS, WE MIGHT BE ABLE

27:43.395 --> 27:49.300
TO PIECE TOGETHER IF IT'S NOT
JUST A PLANET IN WHAT WE CALL
THE "HABITABLE ZONE," BUT IF
IT'S TRULY A HABITABLE

27:49.367 --> 27:55.173
ENVIRONMENT.
>> Pelley: AND SOMEBODY MIGHT
ASK, "WHY DOES IT MATTER?"
>> Batalha: THE END POINT IS

27:55.240 --> 28:01.012
TO PUT AN END TO OUR COSMIC
LONELINESS.
WE WANT TO KNOW IF THERE'S LIFE
OUT THERE.

28:01.079 --> 28:10.822
>> Pelley: FROM A RESEARCHER'S
PERSPECTIVE, IS WEBB
EVOLUTIONARY OR REVOLUTIONARY?
>> Batalha: EVERY TIME YOU PUT A

28:10.889 --> 28:18.196
NEW PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY INTO
SPACE, OR YOU LOOK AT THE
UNIVERSE WITH DIFFERENT EYES,
YOU-- YOU LEARN SOMETHING

28:18.263 --> 28:22.967
REVOLUTIONARY.
SOMETHING THAT YOU COULDN'T HAVE
EVEN PREDICTED.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE

28:23.034 --> 28:30.809
SURPRISES ARE GOING TO BE, BUT
THE TECHNOLOGY IS REVOLUTIONARY.
AND THERE WILL BE TREMENDOUS
SURPRISES THAT WILL ASTOUND US.

28:30.875 --> 28:38.817
>> Pelley: WEBB IS ON THE
DOORSTEP, ABOARD A EUROPEAN
SPACE AGENCY ROCKET.
SOME, INCLUDING AMY LO, MAY HOLD

28:38.883 --> 28:47.025
THEIR BREATH AS IT UNFOLDS
ITSELF ON THE MONTH-LONG JOURNEY
TO ITS STATION AROUND THE SUN.
THE FIRST IMAGES, IN SIX MONTHS

28:47.092 --> 28:56.768
OR SO, WILL BE CONVERTED FROM
INVISIBLE INFRARED INTO PICTURES
SUITABLE FOR HEADLINES.
CHANCES ARE, WHAT WE SEE,

28:56.835 --> 29:15.019
WE WILL NOT UNDERSTAND--
THE VERY DEFINITION OF WONDER.
(<i> TICKING</i> )
>> Jon Wertheim: A REMOTE JEWEL

29:15.086 --> 29:20.692
OF LAND OFF THE COAST OF CANADA,
FOGO ISLAND FLOATS IN THE
NORTHEAST CORNER OF THE
NORTHEAST PROVINCE OF

29:20.758 --> 29:26.631
NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR, THE
OUTSTRETCHED RIGHT FINGERTIP OF
THIS CONTINENT.
THE PLACE MIGHT BE DROP-DEAD

29:26.698 --> 29:33.238
GORGEOUS, BUT IT WASN'T IMMUNE
TO THE FATE BEFALLING SO MANY
SMALL AND ISOLATED COMMUNITIES
IN NORTH AMERICA:

29:33.304 --> 29:39.911
ITS ONE AND ONLY INDUSTRY WENT
INTO STEEP DECLINE, AND SO IN
TURN, DID ITS POPULATION.
THEN, ABOUT A DECADE AGO,

29:39.978 --> 29:46.451
A LOCAL RETURNED HOME,
FRESH OFF MAKING A FORTUNE IN
THE TECH SECTOR.
HER POCKETS WERE DEEP.

29:46.518 --> 29:53.258
SO WAS HER DESIRE TO LIFT UP THE
PLACE AND BRING PEOPLE BACK.
SO, SHE UNLEASHED A SORT OF
ECONOMIC EXPERIMENT.

29:53.324 --> 30:01.766
WE TOOK TWO PLANES, A LONG
DRIVE, AND A FERRY TO REACH
FOGO ISLAND, AND CHECK ON THE
EARLY RESULTS.

30:01.833 --> 30:09.140
THE SAYING HERE GOES:
YOU'LL KNOW THE NEWFOUNDLANDERS
IN HEAVEN-- THEY'LL BE THE ONES
WHO WANT TO GO HOME.

30:09.207 --> 30:16.748
AND THE ADAGE COMES TO LIFE ON
FOGO ISLAND, A 90-SQUARE MILE
PATCHWORK OF TEN MINISCULE
FISHING VILLAGES, WHERE

30:16.814 --> 30:24.355
CLAPBOARD HOUSES THE COLOR OF
JELLY BEANS CLING TO ROCK
400 MILLION YEARS OLD.
AMONG ITS QUIRKS, NEWFOUNDLAND

30:24.422 --> 30:33.164
HAS ITS OWN TIME ZONE-- HALF AN
HOUR AHEAD OF THE MAINLAND.
BUT WANDER THROUGH FOGO ISLAND'S
VILLAGES, AND YOU MIGHT AS WELL

30:33.231 --> 30:38.603
SET YOUR WATCH BACK TO THE 18th
CENTURY.
(<i> PIG SNORTING</i> )
BACK THEN, ALL YOU NEEDED TO

30:38.670 --> 30:48.313
GET BY HERE WAS A PIG, A POTATO
PATCH, AND SOMETHING CALLED A
PUNT: A SMALL, WOODEN FISHING
BOAT USED IN PURSUIT OF NORTH

30:48.379 --> 30:57.255
ATLANTIC COD, THE SPECIES THAT
ONCE KEPT THIS PLACE AFLOAT.
SEEMINGLY EVERY STRUCTURE ON THE
ISLAND WAS BUILT IN SERVICE OF

30:57.322 --> 31:06.431
CATCHING AND PRESERVING FISH.
WITH ONE GLEAMING EXCEPTION.
A $40 MILLION, LUXURY INN.
PART EDGE-OF-THE-EARTH

31:06.497 --> 31:14.305
DESTINATION, PART ECONOMIC-
ENGINE-ON-STILTS, THE INN IS THE
BRAINCHILD OF EIGHTH-GENERATION
FOGO ISLANDER ZITA COBB.

31:14.372 --> 31:19.310
AND LOCALS GAVE HER A FUNNY LOOK
WHEN SHE FIRST FLOATED THE IDEA.
WHAT KIND OF REACTION DID THAT
GET?

31:19.377 --> 31:23.414
>> Zita Cobb: "WHY WOULD ANYONE
COME HERE?"
WE LOVE THIS PLACE, BUT IT
WASN'T OBVIOUS WHEN, YOU KNOW,

31:23.481 --> 31:28.753
THERE ARE FANCY PLACES IN THE
WORLD THAT PEOPLE GO.
OUR ASSUMPTION IS EVERYBODY
WANTS TO GO WHERE IT'S WARM.

31:28.820 --> 31:33.191
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
>> Wertheim: SOMEONE SUGGESTED
TO US, IT LOOKED LIKE A SHIP.
>> Cobb: THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE

31:33.258 --> 31:39.697
INN WAS OBVIOUSLY A TOPIC OF
MUCH CONVERSATION.
I THINK ABOUT IT AS A METAPHOR.
IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE FROM HERE AND

31:39.764 --> 31:44.969
PEOPLE FROM AWAY.
IT'S ABOUT THE FUTURE AND THE
PAST.
>> Wertheim: THE PAST LOOMS

31:45.036 --> 31:51.743
LARGE ON FOGO ISLAND.
TO FULLY APPRECIATE THE INN,
EVEN AS A METAPHOR, YOU HAVE TO
UNDERSTAND FOGO'S HISTORY.

31:51.809 --> 31:58.383
IT'S JUST SOMETHING.
ZITA COBB TOOK US THROUGH DOZENS
OF TINY ISLANDS THAT DOT FOGO'S
WATERS TO A PLACE CALLED LITTLE

31:58.449 --> 32:07.258
FOGO ISLAND; AND FOR THOSE
KEEPING TRACK, THAT'S AN ISLAND,
OFF AN ISLAND, OFF AN ISLAND.
HER ANCESTORS LANDED HERE FROM

32:07.325 --> 32:14.165
IRELAND AND SOUTH ENGLAND.
THEY CAME FOR ONE REASON.
>> Cobb: FISH, FISH, AND FISH.
>> Wertheim: WHEN YOU SAY FISH,

32:14.232 --> 32:20.305
IS IT JUST A GIVEN?
>> Cobb: IT'S A GIVEN.
SO WHEN, YES, WHEN WE SAY FISH,
WE MEAN COD.

32:20.371 --> 32:26.511
>> Wertheim: IS IT POSSIBLE TO
EXAGGERATE THE IMPORTANCE OF COD
TO THIS PLACE?
>> Cobb: NO, IT'S NOT POSSIBLE,

32:26.577 --> 32:34.252
BECAUSE EVERYTHING THAT YOU NEED
TO KNOW ABOUT SOMEONE FROM HERE,
YOU CAN FIGURE IT OUT BY JUST
STUDYING THAT LOWLY FISH.

32:34.319 --> 32:39.123
IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE A NOBLE
FISH.
>> Wertheim: A NOBLE FISH?
>> Cobb: IT ASKS VERY LITTLE,

32:39.190 --> 32:45.029
AND GIES SO MUCH.
THEY EXIST ON ALMOST ANYTHING.
I MEAN, I THINK A COD COULD EAT
A RUBBER BOOT, IF IT HAD TO.

32:45.096 --> 32:51.369
>> Wertheim: NOT UNLIKE THE
NOBLE FISH, ZITA COBB'S FAMILY
SURVIVED WITHOUT FUSS.
IN COD THEY TRUSTED.

32:51.436 --> 32:57.408
FAMILIES WORKED SIDE-BY-SIDE
HERE, TRADING THEIR FISH FOR
GOODS.
NO BANK ACCOUNTS, NO CASH.

32:57.475 --> 33:03.748
COBB'S PARENTS COULD NEITHER
READ NOR WRITE.
SHE AND HER SIX BROTHERS GREW UP
IN A HOUSE WITH NO ELECTRICITY.

33:03.815 --> 33:09.253
SHE SAYS IT WAS A HAPPY
CHILDHOOD.
UNTIL IT WASN'T.
>> Wertheim: WHAT HAPPENED?

33:09.320 --> 33:15.193
>> Cobb: THE WORST OF THE 20th
CENTURY CAME DOWN ON TOP OF US
VERY QUICKLY, IN THE FORM OF THE
INDUSTRIALIZATION OF THE

33:15.259 --> 33:21.833
FISHERIES.
SO, THESE ENORMOUS FACTORY SHIPS
SHOWED UP HERE, ALL ALONG THE
COAST OF NEWFOUNDLAND, AND

33:21.899 --> 33:29.540
FISHED DAY AND NIGHT UNTIL JUST
ABOUT EVERY LAST FISH WAS GONE.
>> Wertheim: WITH ONE SMALL PUNT
LAUNCHED FROM THIS ONE DOCK,

33:29.607 --> 33:35.513
COBB'S FATHER COULDN'T COMPETE
WITH COMMERCIAL VESSELS THAT HAD
COME TO THE NORTH ATLANTIC FROM
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

33:35.580 --> 33:39.917
HOW BAD DID THINGS GET FOR HIM?
>> Cobb: THINGS GOT-- HE WOULD
GO OUT AND COME BACK WITH
NOTHING.

33:39.984 --> 33:47.091
BUT ONE DAY IN PARTICULAR, HE
CAME BACK WITH ONE FISH.
AND HE BROUGHT THE FISH INTO
THE HOUSE, AND HE SLAPPED IT

33:47.158 --> 33:54.198
DOWN ONTO THE KITCHEN FLOOR, AND
SAID, "WELL, IT'S DONE."
AND IT WAS THE NEXT DAY HE
BURNED HIS BOAT.

33:54.265 --> 33:57.902
>> Wertheim: HE BURNED HIS BOAT?
>> Cobb: HE BURNED HIS BOAT.
>> Wertheim: IT'S ALMOST LIKE A
SACRIFICE.

33:57.969 --> 34:05.710
>> Cobb: IT WAS.
HE DID IT AS A STATEMENT.
HE DID IT AS AN EXPRESSION OF
PAIN AND ANGER.

34:05.777 --> 34:12.617
>> Wertheim: LAMBERT COBB MADE
THIS SACRIFICE ONCE HE REALIZED
THAT THOSE BIG BOATS WERE--
IN HIS WORDS-- TURNING FISH INTO

34:12.683 --> 34:17.855
MONEY.
>> Cobb: HE SAID TO ME, AS A
TEN-YEAR-OLD, "YOU HAVE GOT TO
FIGURE OUT HOW THIS MONEY THING

34:17.922 --> 34:23.394
WORKS.
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T, IT'S GOING
TO EAT EVERYTHING WE LOVE."
>> Wertheim: HE WASN'T WRONG.

34:23.461 --> 34:31.269
AS FISH STOCKS DWINDLED, SO DID
THE ISLAND'S POPULATION-- FROM
5,000 TO 2,500.
THE COBBS LEFT, GRUDGINGLY, FOR

34:31.335 --> 34:38.009
THE MAINLAND IN THE 1970s.
ZITA COBB'S FATHER DIED SHORTLY
THEREAFTER; BUT SHE HEEDED HIS
ADVICE.

34:38.075 --> 34:44.515
SHE GOT A BUSINESS DEGREE,
WORKED IN FIBER OPTICS, LANDED
IN SILICON VALLEY, AND BEFORE
LONG, WAS THE THIRD-HIGHEST PAID

34:44.582 --> 34:51.889
FEMALE EXECUTIVE IN AMERICA.
IN HER EARLY 40s, SHE CASHED OUT
TENS OF MILLIONS IN STOCK
OPTIONS, DROPPED OUT OF THE

34:51.956 --> 34:58.329
WINNER-TAKE-ALL ECONOMY, AND
TOOK HER BUSINESS SAVVY HOME,
DETERMINED TO REVITALIZE FOGO
ISLAND.

34:58.396 --> 35:03.801
INSTEAD OF WRITING A CHECK, SHE
POSED A QUESTION:
>> Cobb: WHAT DO WE HAVE, AND
WHAT DO WE KNOW?

35:03.868 --> 35:11.709
AND HOW CAN WE PUT THAT FORWARD
IN A WAY THAT'S DIGNIFIED FOR
FOGO ISLANDERS, AND CREATES
ECONOMY, AND CONNECTS US TO THE

35:11.776 --> 35:19.684
WORLD?
♪ ♪ ♪
>> Wertheim: SPEND ONE NIGHT
AT WHAT THE LOCALS CALL A

35:19.750 --> 35:26.657
SHED PARTY, AND THE ANSWER
EMERGES.
>> Cobb: WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT
THE PEOPLE OF THIS PLACE, IF

35:26.724 --> 35:31.662
THERE'S ONE THING WE'RE REALLY
GOOD AT IT'S HOSPITALITY.
>> Wertheim: WHAT DOES
HOSPITALITY MEAN HERE?

35:31.729 --> 35:37.201
>> Cobb: HOSPITALITY, IN ITS
PUREST FORM, IS THE LOVE OF A
STRANGER.
WE DIDN'T GET A LOT OF STRANGERS

35:37.268 --> 35:42.640
AND WHEN THEY ARRIVED, AS MY
MOTHER USED TO SAY, IT'S ALWAYS
BETTER TO SEE A LIGHT COMING
INTO THE HARBOR THAN A LIGHT

35:42.707 --> 35:47.512
GOING OUT.
>> Wertheim: SO, IN 2013,
COBB BUILT THE BIGGEST BEACON IN
THE HARBOR.

35:47.578 --> 35:54.485
SHE MADETHE FOGO ISLAND INN
THE CENTERPIECE OF A CHARITABLE
TRUST-- CALLED SHOREFAST--
WITH PROFITS REINVESTED IN THE

35:54.552 --> 35:59.290
ISLAND.
AT $2,000 A NIGHT, THE INN DOES
TURN A PROFIT.
BUT THERE WERE OTHER

35:59.357 --> 36:05.463
CONSIDERATIONS.
>> Cobb: WE'RE GOING TO PUT A
29-ROOM INN ON AN ISLAND THAT'S
NEVER HAD AN INN.

36:05.530 --> 36:09.734
WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES OF
THAT?
WELL, MORE PEOPLE WILL COME?
WELL, HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE?

36:09.800 --> 36:15.439
AS ONE WOMAN SAID "WELL, YOU
KNOW, WE'RE ONLY 2,500 PEOPLE.
WE CAN ONLY LOVE SO MANY PEOPLE
AT A TIME."

36:15.506 --> 36:22.747
>> Wertheim: SHOREFAST AND
THE INN EMPLOY MORE THAN 300
ISLANDERS, BUT THE REAL PAYOFF
IS THE RIPPLE EFFECT.

36:22.813 --> 36:30.922
FOR STARTERS, ALL THE FURNITURE
AT THE INN IS LOCALLY MADE.
SAME FOR THE PILLOWS AND QUILTS.
IT SO HAPPENS THE WOMEN OF FOGO

36:30.988 --> 36:36.527
ISLAND HAVE BEEN MAKING THEM FOR
THEIR OWN HOMES FOR 400 YEARS.
>> Lillian Dwyer: WE'RE GETTING
THERE.

36:36.594 --> 36:41.799
WE GOT HALF DONE.
>> Wertheim: WORD IS OUT NOW.
THIS QUILT IS DESTINED FOR A
CUSTOMER IN BALTIMORE.

36:41.866 --> 36:46.237
WE JOINED THE QUILTING BEE...
>> Dwyer: WATCH HIM, MILLICENT.
>> Wertheim: ...BUT DIDN'T LAST
LONG.

36:46.304 --> 36:50.975
IT WAS ALL VERY NICE, EXCEPT FOR
THIS ONE SQUARE.
>> Dwight Budden: THIS IS OUR
LETTUCE ROOM.

36:51.042 --> 36:55.813
>> Wertheim: SHOREFAST PUTS UP
SEED MONEY FOR NEW BUSINESSES,
TOO-- A QUARTER OF A MILLION
DOLLARS SO FAR.

36:55.880 --> 37:01.319
>> Hayward Budden: AND THEN YOU
PUT YOUR PLANT IN.
>> Wertheim: A $7,500 MICRO-LOAN
WENT TO DWIGHT BUDDEN AND HIS

37:01.385 --> 37:09.393
FATHER HAYWARD, A FORMER FISHER
WHO LEFT FOGO ISLAND WHEN THE
INDUSTRY COLLAPSED.
HE'S BACK NOW, AS A HYDROPONIC

37:09.460 --> 37:14.198
FARMER, GROWING GREENS FOR THE
INN.
>> Dwight Budden: YEAH, THERE'S
OUR KALE.

37:14.265 --> 37:19.103
>> Wertheim: DOES HAYWARD EAT
KALE?
>> Hayward Budden: NOT TOO MUCH.
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )

37:19.170 --> 37:26.043
>> Wertheim: BEYOND THE KALE,
NEW CULTURE IS TAKING ROOT.
FUTURISTIC-LOOKING STUDIOS NOW
SPECKLE THE LANDSCAPE-- PART OF

37:26.110 --> 37:36.420
SHOREFAST'S AMBITION TO BRING
ARTISTS-IN-RESIDENCE TO FOGO.
AND BACK AT THE INN, A CHEF
TURNS COD INTO HAUTE CUISINE.

37:36.487 --> 37:42.560
>> Wertheim: IF YOUR DAD SAW COD
WITH MAGNOLIA OIL AND SEA FOAM--
>> Cobb: AND PORCINI.
>> Wertheim: AND PORCINI--

37:42.627 --> 37:45.363
>> Cobb: CINI-- YES.
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
>> Wertheim: WHAT WOULD HE SAY?
>> Cobb: YES.

37:45.429 --> 37:49.367
FIRST THING, HE'D SAY, "CAN YOU
REALLY EAT THAT?"
>> Wertheim: YOU CAN DO MORE
THAN EAT COD; YOU CAN FISH FOR

37:49.433 --> 37:55.573
IT AGAIN.
NOW THAT A DECADES-LONG BAN HAS
BEEN EASED, FOGO ISLAND'S
FISHERS ARE BACK HAULING COD.

37:55.640 --> 38:03.347
WE VENTURED OUT OF FOGO HARBOR
WITH BROTHERS GLEN AND JERRY
BEST-- THE FIFTH GENERATION OF
THEIR FAMILY TO HARVEST THESE

38:03.414 --> 38:07.518
WATERS.
>> Glen Best: YOU GO EAST, YOUR
NEXT STOP IS IRELAND.
>> Wertheim: IRELAND?

38:07.585 --> 38:11.188
>> Glen Best: WE'RE NOT GOING
THERE TODAY.
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
>> Jerry Best: HAND OVER HAND,

38:11.255 --> 38:14.692
LIKE THAT.
ALL RIGHT.
>> Wertheim: THE BEST BROTHERS
SHOWED US THE TRADITIONAL

38:14.759 --> 38:21.465
NEWFOUNDLAND WAY OF FISHING WITH
A HANDLINE-- 150 FEET DOWN, NO
RODS, REELS, OR NETS.
NOW WE'RE TALKING

38:21.532 --> 38:26.570
>> Glen Best: THAT'S A BEAUTY.
>> Wertheim: UP COMES COD,
WITHOUT MUCH OF A FIGHT.
>> Glen Best: NOW THAT'S A NICE

38:26.637 --> 38:32.777
COD.
THAT'S PROBABLY A 20-POUND FISH.
>> Wertheim: COD IS MAKING A
COMEBACK IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC.

38:32.843 --> 38:40.418
CANADA STILL IMPOSES CATCH
LIMITS, BUT WHEN THE BESTS GET
DOWN TO BUSINESS, THEY USE AN
AUTOMATED SYSTEM TO DROP

38:40.484 --> 38:46.157
THOUSANDS OF HOOKS IN THE WATER
AT A TIME.
WE WATCHED THEM OFFLOAD 20,000
POUNDS OF COD FROM A SINGLE

38:46.223 --> 38:53.397
TRIP.
WHAT'S MORE, SHELLFISH HAS DONE
THE UNTHINKABLE, AND DETHRONED
COD AS KING.

38:53.464 --> 39:01.138
CRAB AND SHRIMP NOW MAKE UP 80%
OF GLEN BEST'S BUSINESS; AND
HE'S NEVER HAD A BETTER YEAR.
YOU TOLD ME YOU CAUGHT 400,000

39:01.205 --> 39:06.577
POUNDS OF SNOW CRAB.
AT $7.60 A POUND.
>> Glen Best: YEAH, IT'S PRETTY
GOOD.

39:06.644 --> 39:10.247
>> Wertheim: $3 MILLION BUCKS.
>> Glen Best: IT ADDS UP.
>> Wertheim: THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.
>> Glen Best: YEAH, IT WAS A

39:10.314 --> 39:14.218
GOOD YEAR.
>> Wertheim: BUT A THRIVING
FISHERY ISN'T ALWAYS ENOUGH TO
KEEP THE KIDS AROUND.

39:14.285 --> 39:19.857
BEST'S THREE CHILDREN HAVE MOVED
AWAY FROM FOGO TO PURSUE OTHER
CAREERS.
YOUR FAMILY'S BEEN DOING THIS

39:19.924 --> 39:25.262
FOR GENERATIONS.
YOU NAMED THIS BOAT AFTER YOUR
DAD.
>> Glen Best: SO, THE SAD PART

39:25.329 --> 39:31.669
ABOUT IT IS THAT JERRY AND
MYSELF, WE PROBABLY COULD BE THE
LAST GENERATION THAT WILL FISH
WITHIN OUR FAMILY.

39:31.736 --> 39:38.709
WHEN THE DAY COMES, THAT THAT
HAPPENS, THAT WILL PROBABLY BE A
SAD DAY.
>> Wertheim: STILL, FOGO

39:38.776 --> 39:43.514
ISLAND'S POPULATION HAS
STABILIZED.
THERE'S HOPE THE NEXT CENSUS
WILL SHOW AN UPTICK.

39:43.581 --> 39:49.553
BABIES ARE THE ISLAND'S BIGGEST
CELEBRITIES.
BUT, AS EVER, WITH GROWTH, COME
GROWING PAINS.

39:49.620 --> 39:57.228
IT'S ALREADY BECOME ONE OF THOSE
ISLANDS WHERE YOU HAVE TO PRAY
TO GET A SPOT ON THE FERRY.
JENNIFER SEXTON SPENT SUMMERS ON

39:57.294 --> 40:03.400
FOGO ISLAND VISITING HER
GRANDPARENTS.
SHE RECENTLY MOVED HERE FROM
WESTERN CANADA TO OPEN THIS

40:03.467 --> 40:08.973
COFFEE JOINT, WHERE LOCALS MIX
WITH THOSE WHO COME FROM AWAY.
>> Jennifer Sexton: EVERYBODY
ASKS ABOUT THE INN.

40:09.039 --> 40:13.911
>> Wertheim: WHAT DO YOU TELL
THEM?
>> Sexton: WELL, IT'S A BLESSING
AND A CURSE.

40:13.978 --> 40:20.785
>> Wertheim: HER REGULARS
GRUMBLE THAT NOT LONG AGO, THEY
COULD GET A HOME FOR $25,000--
CANADIAN.

40:20.851 --> 40:26.123
NOW HOMES COST TEN TIMES AS
MUCH.
>> Sexton: FOR SOMEBODY FROM
AWAY, THAT WOULDN'T BE A LOT.

40:26.190 --> 40:31.962
BUT FOR SOMEBODY FROM HERE, THAT
IS A LOT OF MONEY.
>> Wertheim: ZITA COBB, THE
WOMAN WHO TURNED THIS TIDE,

40:32.029 --> 40:39.003
SAYS SHE DOESN'T WANT UNCHECKED
GROWTH, EITHER.
>> Cobb: AS THE ECONOMY GROWS,
WE WILL BE SMALLER AS A

40:39.069 --> 40:43.140
PERCENTAGE OF THE WHOLE ECONOMY.
>> Wertheim: A RARE BUSINESS
LEADER THAT WANTS<i> LESS</i> MARKET
SHARE.

40:43.207 --> 40:47.444
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
>> Cobb: WE WANT LESS MARKET
SHARE, EXACTLY.
>> Wertheim: YOU SAY THAT WITH A

40:47.511 --> 40:51.682
SMILE ON YOUR FACE, BUT THERE'S
A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY HERE.
>> Cobb: YEAH.
I MEAN, THE CONSEQUENCES ARE

40:51.749 --> 40:57.321
HUGE, BECAUSE-- AS MY BROTHER
SAYS, YES, OUR-- OUR PARENTS
WILL GET OUT OF THE GRAVEYARD
AND WRING OUR NECKS IF WE-- IF

40:57.388 --> 41:02.226
WE MESS THIS UP.
>> Wertheim: WHAT'S YOUR
RESPONSE TO THE-- THE CAPITALIST
WHO WOULD SAY, WHY ARE YOU

41:02.293 --> 41:07.765
LIMITING YOUR GROWTH?
>> Cobb: THAT IS THE TECHNO-
ECONOMIC QUESTION.
BUT I START WITH A DIFFERENT

41:07.832 --> 41:13.771
QUESTION:
WHAT ARE WE OPTIMIZING FOR?
WE ARE OPTIMIZING FOR PLACE.
WE'RE OPTIMIZING FOR COMMUNITY.

41:13.838 --> 41:19.810
>> Wertheim: THE PILLARS OF THIS
COMMUNITY HAVE BEEN WON OVER.
IF COBB'S EXPERIMENT HELPS
DIVERSIFY THE ECONOMY, GLEN BEST

41:19.877 --> 41:24.748
SAYS HE'S ALL-IN.
>> Glen Best: IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE OVERRUN BY TOURISM.
THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT WORKS

41:24.815 --> 41:28.686
HERE.
WE'RE NOT, YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT
