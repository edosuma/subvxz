control over your children.

for an appointment.

No, Mother.

13:58.080 --> 13:59.127
Oh, boy.

13:59.720 --> 14:03.247
A pleasure and honor to meet you,
Seth Ptolemy.

14:03.560 --> 14:07.281

"The Prince of Boo York."

about the great comet

15:39.560 --> 15:41.688
that will arrive tomorrow night?

15:42.160 --> 15:45.900
Do you understand its importance
to our Egyptian scaritage?

15:46.000 --> 15:49.402
Yeah. I understand it got me
a free trip to Boo York.

15:51.760 --> 15:55.970
Centuries ago, a small piece
of that comet broke away

15:56.200 --> 15:58.620
and landed in the Sa-horror desert.

Once made, it cannot be undone.

16:18.160 --> 16:19.730
Yeah, yeah, no take-backsies.

16:22.040 --> 16:24.646
After its power was discovered,

16:24.800 --> 16:30.020
it became customary for the most
important royal betrothal ceremonies

16:30.120 --> 16:32.460
to be performed under the light
of that comet.

16:32.560 --> 16:37.100
And its power would make
the couple's promise permanent.

16:37.200 --> 16:39.851
(GROANS) What does any of it
have to do with me?

16:41.640 --> 16:44.371

with that Seth kid.

17:00.840 --> 17:02.180

the power you will have

17:05.240 --> 17:08.050
if you go through with this ceremony.

27:13.280 --> 27:15.931

you want in the city from up here.

a whole city to explore!

27:26.880 --> 27:29.008
Well then, we better get started!

27:29.200 --> 27:30.326
Hey, wait up!

27:39.760 --> 27:41.285
Oh, good, you're here!

27:42.000 --> 27:43.420
Now, which do you like better?

27:43.520 --> 27:46.300
Burnt sienna or terrifying
haunted forest green?

27:46.400 --> 27:48.980
They're both nice, I guess.

27:49.080 --> 27:50.300
Well, that's not very helpful.

27:50.400 --> 27:52.129
Well, what are you wearing
to the gala tonight?

27:53.160 --> 27:54.161

27:56.240 --> 27:57.380
I'm not going.

27:57.480 --> 28:00.643

my date if you're not at the gala...

(SIGHS)

28:03.200 --> 28:06.220
Deuce, is this about what happened
at brunch? Because...

28:06.320 --> 28:09.927
It's not just about brunch!
It's about everything!

28:10.240 --> 28:13.722
Cleo, look at us.
This was never going to last.

28:13.920 --> 28:16.127
We're just too different.

28:17.240 --> 28:18.571
What are you saying?

28:19.080 --> 28:22.368

28:22.960 --> 28:26.248

28:26.920 --> 28:30.288
I'm just an average guy,
oh, yes, it's true

28:31.040 --> 28:34.420
I know just what to do
when it comes down to me and you

28:34.520 --> 28:38.100
I'd hate to have this happen
the way it has to happen

28:38.200 --> 28:42.171
What I thought was perfect matching
was a perfect mismatch

28:42.280 --> 28:46.285
And I think I owe it to you
To set you free

28:47.040 --> 28:50.060
'Cause you'll be better,
better off without me

28:50.160 --> 28:53.448

This isn't like you

28:53.640 --> 28:55.500
What's gotten into you?

28:55.600 --> 28:59.491
Tell me who said what to you
to make you do this

28:59.920 --> 29:01.260

29:03.600 --> 29:05.740
about us and neither should you

at the comet gala tonight.

30:22.640 --> 30:24.380

No, and my family can't stand it.

Who cares about galas, I'm not going!

33:24.680 --> 33:28.241
What? No, no, you have to!
You have to be there to promise...

To promise, because
you promised you would.

You don't want to let
everybody down, do you?

33:54.240 --> 33:56.242
I'm Cleo de Nile.

33:56.840 --> 34:01.368

what they want.

somebody inside, right?

we do this all the time.

35:04.520 --> 35:07.603
I haven't felt inspired to write
like this in a long time...

35:11.600 --> 35:16.208
So, where did you
learn to rap like that?

35:16.400 --> 35:20.325
Well, I don't know how to tell you this,
but I'm a mummy.

I won't be rapping anymore.

You can't quit!

35:44.880 --> 35:46.405
Why not? You quit.

35:46.720 --> 35:48.290
Yeah, but that's different.

I stopped singing because
I wasn't being true to myself.

But you, you're singing from your heart.
The way I always wanted to.

35:57.440 --> 36:00.980
You've found your voice.
Why would you give that up?

36:01.080 --> 36:02.127
It's complicated.

36:02.240 --> 36:04.129
They offered me fame, money.

and find what you have.

Thank you, Mother.

36:38.960 --> 36:43.807
Very good. That's the kind of music
we want to hear this evening.

36:43.960 --> 36:46.930
None of that other stuff.

36:47.200 --> 36:48.440
Isn't that right, Seth?

36:48.640 --> 36:49.880
Yes, Mother.

36:53.960 --> 36:56.566
I presume there will
be a promise ceremony

36:56.680 --> 36:59.251
later tonight with the Ptolemy boy?

36:59.480 --> 37:04.122
Of course, Daddy. I've got Cleo
exactly where I want her...

37:09.160 --> 37:15.520
MS. PTOLEMY: The great comet hurtling
through space, brimming with magical energy.

37:17.480 --> 37:21.166
And tonight, she visits us once more.

37:23.840 --> 37:26.127
Our ancestors believed the great comet

37:26.240 --> 37:28.481
was a gift from the others above.

37:28.680 --> 37:33.846
A mysterious race of beings
who live beyond the stars.

37:34.120 --> 37:35.485
Why did they send it?

37:36.520 --> 37:39.842
A message? A peace offering? A warning?

37:41.520 --> 37:44.126
But what we do know
is that any promise made

37:44.240 --> 37:46.260
under the magic light of the comet

37:46.360 --> 37:48.362
cannot be broken.

37:48.560 --> 37:51.260
And so we created the promise ceremony,

37:51.360 --> 37:54.648
where our royal children would
commit to be together,

37:54.880 --> 38:00.046
forever joining their families
to create powerful dynasties.

38:00.600 --> 38:04.127
And when the ceremony is complete,
the comet leaves.

38:05.360 --> 38:07.681
But we have something to remind us

38:07.800 --> 38:10.087
that she'll be back again someday.

That doesn't make any sense!

39:21.200 --> 39:25.100
Right? They were

to go fluttering around

39:57.480 --> 39:59.767

you and Seth to perform

40:06.600 --> 40:09.171

40:10.840 --> 40:14.380

of the de Niles and the Ptolemys

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:33.940
- Hello! Welcome, Astranova!
- Nice to meet you, Astranova!

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:35.740
- Your voice is so beautiful.
- I like your sphere ship thing.

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:37.780
Are you having a party?

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:39.660
Well, it's midnight.

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:43.481
I'm in Boo York with my Deuce
and my ghoul friends

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:46.285
in the middle of Times Scare!

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:49.922
You'd better believe
we're having a party!

01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:52.443
I love parties.

01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:59.820
(SINGING) Because we all

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:03.163
We all are shooting stars

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:08.688
I am the light in the dark

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:18.131
For every one of you there is a song

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:23.810
From outer space above to your hearts

01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:29.490
When you hold your head up high

01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:33.284
And look up into the night

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.809
I'm falling out of the sky

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:37.700
Falling out of the sky

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:40.644
I'm falling out of the sky

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.083
'Cause we are shooting stars

01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:45.886
Light it up

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:47.805
Be who you are

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:51.530
'Cause we are shooting stars

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:53.804
Light it up

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:56.491
Be who you are, who you are

01:07:56.680 --> 01:08:00.380
Burn in the sky with love
Light the dark from above

01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:03.848
Hear the sound of our voices
Make the world recognize us

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.447
It's time that we rise up
Yeah, it's time that we get down

01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:11.060
Burst in flames, don't it look cool
as we head towards the ground

01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:14.900
Hear the sound of the whole crowd
Make the declaration out loud

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.002
It's a celebration of who we are

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:19.162
Not ashamed to show all our flaws

01:08:19.279 --> 01:08:22.939
Not ashamed of not being perfect
But we are more than worth it

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:24.804
We gonna have the time of our life

01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:26.620
dancing under the moonlit night

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:29.484
When you hold your head up high

01:08:30.279 --> 01:08:33.740
And look up into the night

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:37.287
We're falling out of the sky

01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:41.042
We're here to light up the night

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:43.210
(VOCALIZING)

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.042
We're shooting stars

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.685
Be who you are

01:08:56.479 --> 01:08:58.403
We're shooting stars

01:09:00.319 --> 01:09:02.243
Be who you are

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:06.001
- You are a star
- We're shooting stars

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.526
Be who you are, who you are

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:15.448
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:38.490
Go, Operetta!

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:42.060
Go, ghouls!

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:43.400
Way to go, Astranova!

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:44.780
Astranova rocks!

01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:45.881
Operetta!

01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:49.646
Astranova, Operetta,

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:53.580
while I admire your appreciation
for the musical arts,

01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:56.081
I am trying to teach a lesson here!

01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:57.681
Sorry.

01:10:57.800 --> 01:10:58.801
(GIGGLES)

01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:00.605
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:03.241
Oh, hi.

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:06.580
Sorry I didn't return
your call. Traveling.

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:08.820
But you'll never believe where I am.

01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:10.460
ALIEN GIRL: Yeah? Tell us.

01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:12.801
Monster High! It's real!

01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:15.060
Oh. Fablelous.

01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:16.844
Yeah, and it gets better.

01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:19.321
All the lands, all the high schools

01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:21.681
that we thought were just stories?

01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:23.140
They're real!

01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:25.811
So it is true!
