03:30.886 --> 03:32.326
Hi.

03:32.447 --> 03:35.327
Harry! What a surprise.
It's good to see you.

03:36.206 --> 03:39.007
Hey... It's not what it looks like.

03:39.127 --> 03:41.888
Tony and I are old friends.
Ain't that

03:42.007 --> 03:43.928
right, Tony?

03:44.048 --> 03:46.008
Harry and I were partners.

03:46.128 --> 03:48.089
Harry?

03:48.208 --> 03:50.168
Well, more than partners?

03:50.288 --> 03:52.648
Good times, Harry?

03:54.169 --> 03:56.129
No.
No, Harry.

03:57.249 --> 03:58.929
Harry, no!

04:11.291 --> 04:13.931
Cut, cut!

04:14.051 --> 04:16.531
Great!
We've got it!

04:16.651 --> 04:18.612
Are you ladies all right?

04:18.732 --> 04:20.452
Are you OK?
That was great.

04:21.851 --> 04:23.812
Ellen, come on outta there.

04:25.972 --> 04:28.933
- How was I?
- You were great. Nobody dies like you.

04:29.973 --> 04:31.613
Are we goin' again?

04:31.733 --> 04:33.933
- Not on your bit.
- Good! I'm free!

04:34.053 --> 04:36.014
He wants the bartender again.

04:36.134 --> 04:38.935
- Yeah, you're free for lunch.
- Where are we going?

04:39.054 --> 04:41.375
- The Italian joint?
- I hate Italian food.

04:41.495 --> 04:43.455
Hey, you did a beautiful job.

04:43.575 --> 04:45.935
- Where have you been?
- Plenty of blood.

04:46.055 --> 04:48.975
- How are we doin' here?
- Rollie... Great work.

04:49.096 --> 04:51.976
- Looked terrific.
- Let's do it again sometime.

04:52.096 --> 04:54.056
We will, in a minute.

04:54.176 --> 04:57.137
It's perfect now.
The cornstarch works great.

04:57.256 --> 04:59.217
- Rollie Tyler?
- Yeah.

04:59.337 --> 05:01.537
- Hi. I'm Joe Leitner.
- How do you do?

05:01.657 --> 05:04.018
Rollie, that was sensational.
As usual.

05:04.137 --> 05:07.217
- We're gonna go again soon.
- Yeah. We'll be right...

05:07.337 --> 05:10.418
I've been a big fan of yours since
you came to this country.

05:10.538 --> 05:14.539
Thank you very much but... we're
a little busy now, as you can see.

05:14.658 --> 05:17.859
- How did you get on the set?
- I'm not just a fan.

05:17.979 --> 05:19.779
I'm a producer.

05:19.899 --> 05:21.899
I've really admired your stuff.

05:22.019 --> 05:24.580
- Ever since Vermin from Venus.
- You saw that?

05:24.700 --> 05:27.621
That's the one that got
him deported from Australia.

05:27.740 --> 05:30.500
But the special effects were...
incredible!

05:30.621 --> 05:33.940
- And also very expensive.
- Well, we have a decent budget.

05:34.061 --> 05:37.501
Which brings me to the
project I wanted to talk to you about.

05:37.622 --> 05:41.022
- It's not a splatter movie. More sci-fi.
- Hi.

05:41.142 --> 05:44.142
I'm Ellen.
I'm in the movie.

05:44.262 --> 05:46.503
Right!
The wig and everything.

05:46.622 --> 05:49.543
- That was lovely. I saw that.
- Thank you.

05:49.663 --> 05:51.743
That was...

05:53.943 --> 05:57.864
- If we could discuss this privately...
- Tomorrow, 11 a.m. at my workshop?

05:57.984 --> 06:00.824
11 a.m. is great.
Thanks very much. I appreciate this.

06:00.944 --> 06:03.824
Very nice to meet you.
And that looked great! Amazing.

06:03.945 --> 06:05.705
Bye-bye.

06:05.825 --> 06:07.785
Thanks very much.

06:07.905 --> 06:09.865
Nice man.
Might be a job in that.

06:09.985 --> 06:13.465
Nobody cares about making
movies about people any more.

06:13.585 --> 06:16.346
All they care about is... special effects.

06:16.986 --> 06:18.586
I'm gonna cry.

06:18.706 --> 06:20.746
- Frank, can I borrow this?
- Sure.

06:26.708 --> 06:28.547
Rollie...

06:28.667 --> 06:30.987
- That works great!
- It's good, innit?

06:31.107 --> 06:33.268
- It's for the suicide scene.
- Sure is.

06:33.388 --> 06:35.228
- It's great.
- Like it?

06:35.348 --> 06:36.868
No.

06:40.189 --> 06:44.589
Listen, guys. I'm gonna skip lunch cos
I feel yucky and I wanna take a shower.

06:44.709 --> 06:48.270
- Charlie, could you drop Ellen off?
- Yeah. No problem.

06:48.389 --> 06:51.030
I love you. Goodbye.
7 o'clock. Don't forget.

06:51.150 --> 06:53.271
- Bye, Andy.
- Bye, Ellen.

06:53.390 --> 06:57.551
The first stop is Prince
Street between Wooster and Greene.

07:05.752 --> 07:09.473
I'm the first to make
sure of my real life pleasure!

07:09.552 --> 07:11.513
I have an audition in half an hour.

07:11.633 --> 07:15.953
I have to go to Susan's apartment.
Water those cats and feed the plants.

07:16.073 --> 07:18.754
Don't forget.
Dinner tonight in Susan's apartment.

07:18.873 --> 07:22.194
I don't wanna go.
I'll stay here with... No, I gotta go.

07:25.235 --> 07:28.635
Do you have to rehearse this
early in the morning?

07:37.595 --> 07:39.036
Oh, God...

07:39.156 --> 07:41.836
- Good luck!
- Break a leg.

07:41.957 --> 07:43.916
Break a leg.

08:02.558 --> 08:04.359
Taxi!

08:21.481 --> 08:22.962
Hey, Leitner!

08:25.282 --> 08:27.002
Up here!

09:00.326 --> 09:02.966
Sorry.
I should've warned you about Rosebud.

09:03.086 --> 09:07.006
- I use it to scare off burglars.
- I can believe that!

09:07.126 --> 09:10.367
- Come on in.
- That is great.

09:12.487 --> 09:14.447
Oh, my God!

09:14.768 --> 09:17.328
- Song of the Succubus.
- That's right.

09:22.008 --> 09:23.848
Planet of the Female Mummies.

09:23.969 --> 09:26.809
- You've done your homework.
- Yeah... Oh, God!

09:26.929 --> 09:28.889
Blood in the Basement.

09:29.689 --> 09:32.209
- Careful of that.
- Sorry.

09:32.330 --> 09:34.610
- I Dismember Mama.
- You know 'em all.

09:34.730 --> 09:37.131
Yeah. That's great.
That's beautiful.

09:44.171 --> 09:46.291
Rock-A-Die Baby.

09:46.411 --> 09:48.531
How about some coffee, Mr Leitner?

09:50.612 --> 09:53.132
My name's not Leitner.
It's Lipton.

09:53.252 --> 09:56.293
OK, Lipton.
In that case, maybe you'd prefer tea.

09:56.413 --> 09:59.413
- I'm not a movie producer either.
- So what are you?

10:01.333 --> 10:03.294
Justice Department.

10:03.413 --> 10:08.214
Sorry about using the phoney names,
but it's for security, yours as well as mine.

10:08.334 --> 10:10.534
- Am I in trouble?
- No! Not at all.

10:10.654 --> 10:13.214
As a matter of fact, we are.
And...

10:13.334 --> 10:18.095
We thought we might be able to
utilise your particular genius to help us out.

10:20.615 --> 10:23.375
- Did you say coffee?
- Yeah. Great. Thanks.

10:23.495 --> 10:26.256
Ever heard of the Witness
Relocation Program?

10:26.376 --> 10:27.896
Can't say I have, no.

10:28.016 --> 10:32.377
Basically people testify for the government
in exchange for protection.

10:32.497 --> 10:35.857
We give them new identities, set
them up in different cities...

10:35.977 --> 10:38.778
- Milk? Sugar?
- Milk, no sugar. Thanks.

10:38.898 --> 10:41.658
I did a movie like that once.
A guy sees a murder...

10:41.778 --> 10:43.738
I'd like to hear about that, but...

10:43.858 --> 10:47.618
- We have Nicholas De Franco in custody.
- The Mob guy? I read about him.

10:47.738 --> 10:50.499
He'll testify for us if we
can keep him alive that long.

10:50.618 --> 10:52.619
Well, good luck.

10:52.739 --> 10:54.700
A contract's been put out on his life.

10:54.820 --> 10:58.660
So we figure the best thing to do is
to make them believe that he's dead.

10:58.780 --> 11:00.140
There you go.

11:04.060 --> 11:06.260
We wanna stage a fake assassination.

11:06.380 --> 11:09.621
We wanna do it in public, and
we want you to supervise it.

11:10.342 --> 11:11.702
You're crazy.

11:11.822 --> 11:13.982
Look, I wasn't just flattering you.

11:14.102 --> 11:17.862
- I know you could pull it off.
- I didn't say I couldn't pull it off.

11:17.982 --> 11:20.142
Just direct it for me.
Supervise it.

11:21.183 --> 11:23.463
Christ!
You've seen too many movies.

11:26.983 --> 11:29.944
Just out of curiosity, when
would this have to happen?

11:30.064 --> 11:32.023
- Within a week.
- God! No way!

11:32.144 --> 11:34.904
Why not?
You're used to working under pressure.

11:35.025 --> 11:37.465
I'm a special-effects man.
I deal in make-believe.

11:37.490 --> 11:39.090
I'd like to keep it like that.

11:39.585 --> 11:41.945
It requires skill, precision and timing!

11:42.065 --> 11:45.745
I couldn't teach you to do what I do in
a week and expect you to pull it off.

11:45.865 --> 11:49.826
We're in a position to break the
Mafia's back, put 20% of 'em behind bars.

11:49.946 --> 11:53.907
- Also, I'll pay $30,000 tax free...
- Money doesn't give me the time I need!

11:54.027 --> 11:56.747
OK, look.
Just think about it.

11:56.867 --> 11:58.827
Just think about it, please.

11:58.947 --> 12:00.908
That's all we ask.

12:02.388 --> 12:03.547
Who's the "we"?

12:05.588 --> 12:09.628
Do you have any idea what damage De
Franco could do to organised crime

12:09.748 --> 12:13.109
- if he lives to testify?
- Nice work if you can get it.

12:14.909 --> 12:16.869
What does that mean?

12:16.989 --> 12:19.469
It means it pisses me off, that's all.

12:21.109 --> 12:23.430
God, this guy's a total slime.

12:24.190 --> 12:27.150
Been one of the heads of organised
crime for 40 years.

12:27.270 --> 12:31.871
Then when he wants to retire, he just gives
evidence and walks away scot-free.

12:31.991 --> 12:36.432
Mr Tyler, that 40 years is
exactly why he's so valuable to us.

12:36.552 --> 12:40.952
I mean, if life were fair we
wouldn't need a Justice Department.

12:41.832 --> 12:43.793
No, I guess you wouldn't.

12:43.912 --> 12:46.313
What do you say?
Will you help us?

12:46.433 --> 12:49.793
Well, I'd like to... but
this is a bit out of my line.

12:49.913 --> 12:51.553
- Shit.
- Martin...

12:51.673 --> 12:54.634
Great.
Stick with your make-believe toy models.

12:54.754 --> 12:58.194
- Mr Tyler's under no obligation.
- Thank you.

12:58.314 --> 13:00.354
Listen, I thank you for coming.

13:00.474 --> 13:05.075
I'm disappointed... You realise it's
important we keep this confidential?

13:05.195 --> 13:07.195
- Yeah, sure.
- And I understand.

13:07.315 --> 13:09.436
I mean, it is a big responsibility.

13:09.556 --> 13:12.356
I appreciate your moral
qualms about De Franco.

13:12.476 --> 13:16.276
I'll remember your moral qualms next
time a teenager OD's on Mafia dope.

13:16.396 --> 13:17.957
Good.
You do that.

13:18.077 --> 13:20.877
Leave him alone, Martin.
We'll get McKinnon.

13:20.997 --> 13:24.958
Yeah, that's the guy we
should've gone to in the first place.

13:26.237 --> 13:28.398
- Bill McKinnon?
- Yeah.

13:28.518 --> 13:30.918
It was nice meeting you, Mr Tyler.

13:32.519 --> 13:34.598
Give me 24 hours to think about it?

13:59.722 --> 14:01.082
Hi.

14:02.202 --> 14:03.562
How are you?

14:06.162 --> 14:08.123
"Fine!
How are you?"

14:08.243 --> 14:12.163
- I'm great. How are you?
- Sorry. I'm a little preoccupied.

14:13.323 --> 14:17.243
- Did you take that job?
- They're thinking about using McKinnon.

14:17.363 --> 14:19.564
McKinnon?
Is there a part for me in it?

14:19.684 --> 14:22.645
You'd work on a job that
used McKinnon instead of me?

14:22.764 --> 14:26.165
Sweetie, never ask an
actress a question like that.

14:27.405 --> 14:30.366
No, there's no part for you in it.
Not in this job.

14:30.486 --> 14:32.806
Then who cares if they use McKinnon?

14:34.246 --> 14:37.446
Bok choy has great texture.
Like alien flesh.

14:37.566 --> 14:39.566
Is that all you ever think about?

14:41.047 --> 14:42.607
I try not to.

14:43.567 --> 14:45.527
What is it?
McKinnon?

14:47.247 --> 14:50.127
- No, not exactly.
- Then why are you so serious?

15:51.255 --> 15:53.215
Andy?
Rollie.

15:53.335 --> 15:55.295
Yeah, I know what time it is.

15:55.415 --> 15:57.376
I need your radiotelephone.

15:57.496 --> 15:59.456
I'll be right over.

16:01.257 --> 16:03.376
No, just leave it with the doorman.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.457
You go back to sleep, all right?

16:06.337 --> 16:08.297
Good night.

16:14.977 --> 16:16.938
That job that guy wanted me to do?

16:17.058 --> 16:18.858
I think I'll do it.

16:20.979 --> 16:22.938
At 3 o'clock in the morning?

17:26.185 --> 17:28.146
See you.

17:42.949 --> 17:47.589
- What's this? You don't smoke cigars.
- Rollie, please don't. It's personal.

17:47.709 --> 17:50.709
Come on, Andy.
I've known you for four years. What is it?

17:50.829 --> 17:52.790
Just don't look in there.
OK?

18:05.791 --> 18:09.392
OK, Andy. Head down Broadway.
I'm not goin' in till noon today.

18:09.512 --> 18:12.832
- Where are we going?
- You are going to return the gear.

18:12.952 --> 18:14.913
I'm gonna see a man about a job.

18:17.233 --> 18:19.192
Now pull over!

18:27.234 --> 18:28.874
Tyler?

18:28.994 --> 18:30.955
Anyone see you come up?

18:31.074 --> 18:33.874
- Did anyone see you?
- No. What the hell are you doing?

18:33.994 --> 18:37.075
- So no one knows you're here.
- My secretary! I told her.

18:37.195 --> 18:40.156
- You're lying, Lipton.
- Jesus! All right, I'm lying!

19:00.678 --> 19:03.238
You got a dangerous sense of humour, mate.

19:12.439 --> 19:14.400
So how does this work?

19:16.639 --> 19:18.320
Have a look in the crotch.

19:21.840 --> 19:23.841
It's a receiver.

19:23.961 --> 19:26.081
Yeah.
And here's the transmitter.

19:26.201 --> 19:28.161
It's like remote control.

19:28.281 --> 19:30.562
- Are there blanks in there?
- Yeah, blanks.

19:30.681 --> 19:34.402
Remember the programmed sequence and
you hit a bull's-eye every time.

19:35.962 --> 19:37.522
De Franco?

19:37.642 --> 19:39.402
De Franco.
When?

20:26.208 --> 20:27.568
Turn him to the side.

20:39.329 --> 20:42.851
I look ugly. I hope you're a better
effects man than photographer.

20:42.970 --> 20:44.690
You'll soon find out.

20:44.810 --> 20:48.490
All right, pick a point in space.
Look at it. Close your eyes.

21:13.573 --> 21:15.534
You'll be all right.

21:45.097 --> 21:47.058
Lipton.

21:52.098 --> 21:54.059
Support the front.

21:54.539 --> 21:56.299
Good.

22:05.100 --> 22:07.060
Lean forward.

22:17.381 --> 22:18.861
It's five minutes.

22:41.744 --> 22:44.464
- Is that it?
- We can do it again if you want to.

22:44.585 --> 22:46.545
Wise guy.

22:52.466 --> 22:55.066
Have you got the negatives?

23:02.107 --> 23:05.787
I gather Lipton thinks everything
is going fine. What do you think?

23:05.907 --> 23:08.108
You're the director.
I just rig 'em.

23:08.227 --> 23:10.268
If he blows this, we're in trouble.

23:10.388 --> 23:14.348
We will not only look pretty silly,
we'll never get another witness.

23:14.469 --> 23:18.429
He'll be all right. He's just got to
calm down. A bit nervous, I think.

23:18.549 --> 23:20.510
Listen, Rollie...

23:20.629 --> 23:22.909
I know I don't have
the right to ask this.

23:23.029 --> 23:24.590
Yeah, go on.

23:24.710 --> 23:27.630
You know you're the only
one who can do this job.

23:27.750 --> 23:30.710
We're talkin' about a
very special effect here.

23:30.830 --> 23:34.151
You've got the knowledge.
You've got the experience.

23:34.271 --> 23:36.231
Without you it just won't work.

23:36.351 --> 23:38.431
You want me to pull the trigger?

23:39.751 --> 23:41.312
Terrific!

23:41.432 --> 23:43.472
What if someone takes a shot at me?

23:43.592 --> 23:46.352
The restaurant will be
filled with our people.

23:46.472 --> 23:48.433
- And Lipton?
- Forget about Lipton.

23:48.552 --> 23:51.512
If he gives you any
trouble, you come directly to me.

23:51.633 --> 23:53.393
Rollie...

23:53.513 --> 23:56.073
This is a case where we really need you.

23:58.714 --> 24:01.674
30,000 dollars.
60 seconds' work.

24:10.875 --> 24:13.956
Michael Corleone went to Sicily.
What happens to me?

24:14.076 --> 24:17.076
You are 100 per cent protected.
I give you my word.

24:18.116 --> 24:20.076
I also give you my thanks.

24:20.196 --> 24:22.916
I can't tell you how
much we appreciate this.

24:35.678 --> 24:37.638
I must be mad.

25:03.602 --> 25:05.961
All right. Sit down.
Shirt off.

25:06.081 --> 25:08.842
- What, not even a hello?
- Hello.

25:08.962 --> 25:11.162
- Shirt off.
- Always a wise guy.

25:11.283 --> 25:13.642
Talks like he's gettin' ready to kill me.

25:13.762 --> 25:15.203
What's that?

25:16.083 --> 25:17.444
What, this?

25:17.563 --> 25:19.523
I got a pack of Luckies in there.

25:19.644 --> 25:21.883
No, it's a pacemaker.
Cost me 15 grand.

25:22.003 --> 25:24.684
- And they call me a thief!
- You probably are.

25:24.804 --> 25:26.365
That's cold.

25:26.485 --> 25:28.444
There you are.

25:29.485 --> 25:32.525
Hey, this is great.
Gimme your best shot, right here.

25:33.766 --> 25:35.725
I might kill you.

25:39.486 --> 25:40.886
Put that gun down.

25:51.807 --> 25:53.647
All right.
This is spirit gum.

25:53.768 --> 25:55.727
- What's that? Glue?
- Yup.

26:06.689 --> 26:08.649
That's it.

26:08.769 --> 26:10.850
The Man in the Iron Mask.

26:12.530 --> 26:14.650
Here, pass this through, will you?

26:22.971 --> 26:25.731
- What's this black box?
- A receiver.

26:25.852 --> 26:27.691
What, like some kinda radio?

26:27.811 --> 26:31.132
- Exactly like a radio.
- Forget it! Are you guys nuts?

26:31.252 --> 26:33.653
- What's the matter?
- My pacemaker!

26:33.772 --> 26:36.933
If I get any voltage near
my chest, I'm dead for real!

26:37.053 --> 26:40.133
- Not with this amperage.
- How the hell do you know?

26:40.254 --> 26:43.053
Listen, Tyler, you'd
better be goddamn sure!

26:48.974 --> 26:50.935
Now I'm sure.
All right?

26:51.055 --> 26:53.054
Let's get on with it.
Siddown.

26:54.735 --> 26:56.295
Wise guy.

26:58.535 --> 27:01.096
Let's start again, eh?

27:09.616 --> 27:12.737
- Well? Am I beautiful?
- Settle for Italian.

27:12.857 --> 27:14.817
Hey, Tyler...

27:16.138 --> 27:18.738
Don't screw up.

27:27.459 --> 27:30.539
Don't forget to get rid of that shit.

27:37.660 --> 27:39.620
Better get rid of that.

27:39.741 --> 27:42.500
I hate to do it.
Particularly this one.

27:42.621 --> 27:44.581
No loose ends.

28:24.986 --> 28:26.946
Here we go.

29:23.713 --> 29:27.033
- They got there fast!
- Of course they did. They're ours.

29:28.793 --> 29:31.113
- Any problems?
- No. No problems at all.

29:31.233 --> 29:34.314
People everywhere.
I shot him in the middle of his shrimp.

29:39.594 --> 29:41.155
Why the plastic?

29:41.275 --> 29:43.595
I didn't want to get
any stains on the seat.

29:43.715 --> 29:45.915
What stains?

29:47.716 --> 29:49.315
I'm sorry, Rollie.

29:50.556 --> 29:52.156
No loose ends.

30:16.559 --> 30:18.760
Not again.
Not again!

30:18.880 --> 30:20.439
No parkin' after 10 o'clock!

30:20.560 --> 30:23.680
I told ya yesterday!
No parkin' after 10 o'clock!

30:23.800 --> 30:26.520
What the hell's the
matter with you people?!

30:26.640 --> 30:28.601
This is my site!
My street!

31:28.847 --> 31:30.568
Mason, it's Tyler!

31:30.688 --> 31:34.248
- Lipton just tried to kill me!
- What are you talking about?

31:34.368 --> 31:37.169
- You heard me!
- When? Where?

31:37.289 --> 31:40.049
In the car after the stunt.
He pulled a gun on me!

31:40.169 --> 31:43.409
- Were you hurt?
- No, no. I'm not hurt. I just took off.

31:43.529 --> 31:48.130
- He's out here somewhere! He's after me!
- Hold it just a second. Let me think.

31:48.250 --> 31:51.890
What's there to think about?
He's up to something! He tried to kill me!

31:52.010 --> 31:55.131
De Franco must have paid Lipton off.
I'll kill him!

31:55.251 --> 31:57.212
Not if they kill me first!

31:57.332 --> 31:59.571
Listen to me.
Stay right where you are.

31:59.691 --> 32:01.452
Are you kiddin'?!

32:01.572 --> 32:03.372
You've gotta get to me!

32:03.492 --> 32:07.733
Do as I tell you, Rollie!
I can't let you take any more risks.

32:07.853 --> 32:12.974
I'll send a patrol car to take you to the
commissioner's office. I'll meet you there.

32:13.093 --> 32:15.053
Yeah!
OK.

32:15.174 --> 32:17.133
Just fuckin' hurry up!

32:17.253 --> 32:19.214
OK.
Now, where are you?

32:19.334 --> 32:21.294
I don't know!
In a phone booth!

32:21.414 --> 32:23.375
On the corner of

32:23.495 --> 32:24.934
51st

32:25.054 --> 32:26.215
and 11th!

32:26.335 --> 32:29.775
All right. Rollie, I can't tell
you how sorry I am this happened.

32:29.895 --> 32:32.536
But do me a favour, yourself a favour.
Stay there.

32:32.655 --> 32:34.616
- Wait for us. OK?
- All right!

32:58.019 --> 33:01.179
Yeah, Rick and Susie want
us to meet them at Kelly's.

33:02.019 --> 33:06.219
I know it's raining. So what?
A little rain never hurt anybody.

33:42.424 --> 33:46.704
Base One, this is Mobile One. We made
the delivery but it's the wrong address.

33:46.824 --> 33:49.425
- Get outta there fast.
- What about Tyler?

33:49.545 --> 33:51.745
Forget Tyler!
Just get outta there!

33:53.145 --> 33:55.865
- Did you get that?
- Yeah.

33:57.745 --> 33:59.706
So what do we do?

33:59.826 --> 34:03.826
Get over to the hospital.
It's time we brought in a professional.

34:07.547 --> 34:12.667
- Do you have any suspects?
- Not yet but we have several possibilities.

34:12.788 --> 34:16.348
- Wasn't De Franco in protective custody?
- Yes, he was.

34:16.467 --> 34:18.668
Well, who was protecting him?

34:29.309 --> 34:31.069
Hi, Jake.

34:34.070 --> 34:36.030
There he is.
What's left of him.

34:36.150 --> 34:38.110
Yeah, that's De Franco.

34:38.231 --> 34:40.871
- Want me to sign this?
- Yeah. Please.

34:43.351 --> 34:46.431
I'll take this down to the
squad and have it vouched for.

34:56.513 --> 34:58.073
Good night.

35:02.954 --> 35:04.913
Quick, get in there.

35:17.315 --> 35:19.875
- Why you?
- Because they knew I'd fall for it.

35:19.995 --> 35:23.836
"Rollie, you're the best"!
I dropped my pants and bent over.

35:23.956 --> 35:27.116
- Who are "they"?
- I know who they said they were, but...

35:27.237 --> 35:30.637
- Why not go to the police?
- An hour ago two cops tried to kill me!

35:30.757 --> 35:32.718
They're probably not real police.

35:32.837 --> 35:36.638
They had a police car, a police radio...
They looked like fuckin' police!

35:38.438 --> 35:40.398
Relax!

35:40.518 --> 35:42.478
You haven't done anything.

35:42.599 --> 35:44.558
I'm not so sure.

35:45.879 --> 35:47.839
I loaded the gun with blanks.

35:48.879 --> 35:51.839
But when I was makin'
up De Franco in the truck,

35:51.959 --> 35:54.119
Lipton kept messin' with the gun.

35:54.240 --> 35:57.560
- So?
- So... what if he put in real bullets?

35:57.681 --> 35:59.240
Oh, God.

35:59.360 --> 36:03.561
But then if they wanted him dead, why
didn't they just kill him themselves?

36:03.681 --> 36:05.641
I don't know.

36:09.162 --> 36:10.762
- Wait.
- What?

36:10.882 --> 36:12.842
What?
Come on.

36:12.962 --> 36:15.642
You said they wanted to
do it in public, right?

36:15.763 --> 36:17.042
Yeah.

36:17.162 --> 36:21.443
To kill De Franco, they had to get
him away from police protection.

36:21.563 --> 36:24.924
Well, maybe they knew that
De Franco would refuse

36:25.044 --> 36:28.204
unless Rollie Tyler, the
effects man, was there.

36:28.324 --> 36:30.484
To pull off this phoney murder.

36:31.724 --> 36:33.685
You were the bait!

36:57.448 --> 36:59.407
What time is it?

36:59.527 --> 37:02.248
Don't worry about it.
There's no work today.

37:03.928 --> 37:05.888
How are you feeling?

37:07.809 --> 37:09.689
How are you feeling?

37:09.808 --> 37:11.689
I've been better.

37:16.289 --> 37:18.050
I'm not kidding!

37:19.010 --> 37:20.530
Leave me alone.

37:20.650 --> 37:22.970
- I've figured it out.
- What do you mean?

37:23.090 --> 37:25.651
It's simple.
You go directly to the newspapers.

37:25.771 --> 37:28.211
- Come on.
- I mean it.

37:28.331 --> 37:32.331
Do a Woodward and Bernstein.
Blow the whistle on these bastards.

37:32.451 --> 37:34.772
What makes you think they'd believe me?

37:35.812 --> 37:37.772
I believe you.

37:39.732 --> 37:41.973
Stop being so paranoid.

37:42.093 --> 37:44.293
It's such a gorgeous day.

37:45.093 --> 37:47.054
You're such a gorgeous girl.

37:48.893 --> 37:52.094
The sun is shining, the
birds are singing, flowers growing.

37:52.214 --> 37:54.254
Come on.
Get dressed and let's go do it.

37:54.374 --> 37:55.855
Get up.

37:55.975 --> 37:57.934
Someone will believe us.

38:00.254 --> 38:02.016
Yeah, I guess they will.

40:31.753 --> 40:33.513
Talk to me.

40:33.634 --> 40:35.313
I said talk to me!

40:36.433 --> 40:38.394
Talk to me, you bastard!

40:40.154 --> 40:43.274
Who are ya?!
Who sent ya?! Why'd ya kill her?!

40:43.394 --> 40:46.595
Who does Mason work for?!
I want Mason!

42:15.005 --> 42:16.966
Oh, no...

42:24.007 --> 42:25.526
What?!

42:25.647 --> 42:27.607
138 Greene Street.

42:27.727 --> 42:29.768
Can't you even say hello?

42:29.888 --> 42:31.808
138 Greene Street.
Like the colour.

42:31.928 --> 42:34.728
One unknown male, white.
One unknown female, white.

42:34.847 --> 42:37.248
Both unidentified.
Hello and goodbye.

42:52.330 --> 42:54.691
Bobby, get a shot of this window.

42:57.610 --> 43:01.572
- What happened to the bodies?
- The ME took them downtown.

43:01.691 --> 43:04.852
- Who reported it?
- Susan Melnick. It's her apartment.

43:04.972 --> 43:06.931
- Where is she?
- Downtown.

43:07.052 --> 43:10.212
How am I supposed to
investigate if everybody's downtown?

43:10.333 --> 43:14.293
I couldn't hold 'em here for ever, Leo.
I didn't know when you'd show up.

43:16.693 --> 43:21.254
Hey, Leo? Here's what we came up with
in an empty apartment across the street.

43:22.293 --> 43:26.614
- What is that, Eddie? 30-calibre?
- Yeah, 30-calibre close-assault carbine.

43:26.734 --> 43:29.134
US model with silencer and laser scope.

43:29.255 --> 43:31.214
Jesus H Christ.

43:31.334 --> 43:34.336
Whatever happened to Saturday-night
specials?

43:34.455 --> 43:36.015
- This was the girl?
- Yeah.

43:36.135 --> 43:37.896
Shot through the front?

43:38.016 --> 43:40.976
We figured she was standing at
the window when she got it.

43:41.096 --> 43:43.056
How did she get to the bed?

43:43.176 --> 43:45.537
- What about him?
- He's a William J Adams.

43:45.656 --> 43:47.776
They're trying to figure it out now.

43:47.897 --> 43:52.937
Start checkin' with the neighbours.
I'll catch you later. Downtown.

44:00.938 --> 44:02.539
He was a cop.

44:04.339 --> 44:06.299
- A cop?
- Ex-cop.

44:06.418 --> 44:08.179
William J Adams.

44:08.299 --> 44:10.259
Born
10-05-46.

44:10.380 --> 44:13.540
Two years military.
Honourable discharge.

44:13.660 --> 44:17.340
Six years NYPD.
Packed the job in 04-06-81.

44:19.340 --> 44:21.301
The rest is N/A.

44:22.141 --> 44:23.901
Not available.

44:24.021 --> 44:27.061
Could you get me a
make on the fingerprints?

44:33.782 --> 44:35.382
Here it is.

44:35.502 --> 44:39.303
They lifted four sets of prints from
the apartment. Two male, two female.

44:39.423 --> 44:43.583
The female matched the dead girl and
the apartment's owner, Susan Melnick.

44:43.704 --> 44:47.184
One of the male's prints
match your dead cop: Adams.

44:47.304 --> 44:49.824
We're still trying to make the other.

44:49.944 --> 44:52.504
- Leo.
- Mickey, anything from the neighbours?

44:52.624 --> 44:54.665
- Nobody heard a thing.
- Of course.

44:54.785 --> 44:57.105
- But I got the word on Ellen Keith. Hi.
- Hi.

44:57.865 --> 45:00.905
She had a couple or three
boyfriends this last year.

45:01.025 --> 45:05.386
One's a film producer from Beverly Hills.
The other is an actor from California.

45:05.506 --> 45:08.306
- They've both got solid alibis.
- And the third guy?

45:08.426 --> 45:12.587
- Leo, you still need me or can I...?
- Just a sec. What about the third guy?

45:12.787 --> 45:16.267
He's a special-effects man.
They do the tricks in the movies.

45:16.387 --> 45:18.827
They were workin' on the same movie.

45:18.947 --> 45:21.028
Name's Roland Tyler.
They were an item.

45:21.148 --> 45:24.028
- Where is this Tyler?
- He got into the wind two days ago.

45:24.149 --> 45:25.828
Quite a coincidence.

45:25.948 --> 45:27.868
You got an address on this guy?

45:27.989 --> 45:30.029
I think I can find one somewhere.

45:31.749 --> 45:35.350
Sweetie, see what you can dig
up for me on this Adams guy?

45:35.470 --> 45:37.390
Leo, the file's closed!

45:37.510 --> 45:39.550
Reopen it.

46:18.314 --> 46:20.275
Andy, listen.
It's Rollie.

46:20.395 --> 46:22.676
I want you to get
my green make-up kit.

46:22.796 --> 46:24.915
Yeah, it's in my place.
Bring it...

46:25.035 --> 46:28.716
Don't ask any questions, please.
Just do as I ask. All right?

46:28.836 --> 46:32.076
I want you to bring it to
the boat pond in Central Park.

46:32.196 --> 46:34.157
I'll be in the boathouse.

46:34.277 --> 46:37.758
No, we're not doin' a boat movie.
Just do as I ask, please.

46:38.637 --> 46:40.598
I'll see you later.

46:47.838 --> 46:51.159
We were with De Franco.
He asked to go to the bathroom.

46:51.279 --> 46:54.760
After 20 minutes Marshal Morgan
and I went to check and he was gone.

46:54.879 --> 46:58.280
It's like I told Murdoch last night:
De Franco just slipped out.

46:58.400 --> 47:02.160
- How did he get to that restaurant?
- I have no idea. A cab, I suppose.

47:02.280 --> 47:04.240
It's my fault.
I admit it.

47:04.361 --> 47:08.480
- Do you want my resignation?
- I want your report, my desk, one hour.

47:11.762 --> 47:13.721
Look, I'll get outta your hair.

47:13.841 --> 47:15.722
Thanks, Murdoch.

47:15.842 --> 47:18.522
Listen, I'm sorry about all of this!

47:18.642 --> 47:21.723
I want you to meet Agent Whitemore.

47:21.842 --> 47:25.203
- She will be liaison with your office.
- Anything I can do.

47:25.323 --> 47:26.723
My desk,

47:26.843 --> 47:28.803
one hour!

47:30.524 --> 47:32.284
He bought that.

47:32.404 --> 47:33.843
Maybe.

47:33.964 --> 47:37.324
Lieutenant Murdoch, is
an informer involved?

47:39.805 --> 47:43.765
- You don't have shit, do you, Murdoch?
- McCarthy, if you'll excuse me...

47:43.885 --> 47:47.806
Give me De Franco. I'll take all
the press, all the responsibility.

47:47.926 --> 47:51.326
Hell, I'll even give you the collar.
Just give me De Franco.

47:51.446 --> 47:53.006
You'd love that, wouldn't you?

47:53.126 --> 47:57.087
Leo McCarthy, first he brought in
De Franco, then De Franco's killer.

47:57.207 --> 47:59.247
Why don't you just give it up, Leo?

48:03.288 --> 48:07.567
- Not again, Leo. I don't wanna hear it.
- Well, you're gonna hear it, goddamn it.

48:07.688 --> 48:10.808
I busted my ass for six months
on De Franco... six months!

48:10.928 --> 48:15.169
He finally comes in and first he gets shipped
off to Lipton, who gets him killed.

48:15.289 --> 48:19.490
And then you assign the case to that
asshole Murdoch. Why, Jake? Why?

48:19.610 --> 48:23.370
You wanna know why? Because I
don't have time to play wet nurse

48:23.490 --> 48:26.370
to some pathetic cop who
thinks he got the shaft.

48:26.490 --> 48:30.451
- I did get the shaft. You shafted me.
- Know why Murdoch gets the glory?

48:30.571 --> 48:34.091
Because he won't piss people off.
And, Leo, you piss people off.

49:47.420 --> 49:48.780
Rollie?

49:50.860 --> 49:53.140
Hi! I brought...
What are you wearing?!

49:54.261 --> 49:55.861
Look!
You were followed!

49:55.981 --> 49:57.861
- Followed?
- We've gotta lose him.

49:57.981 --> 49:59.461
- Who?
- The tall one!

50:15.543 --> 50:18.584
Rollie Tyler has a rifle pointed
right at your head.

50:23.864 --> 50:27.544
If you wanna meet with him, he'll
know when you take this boat

50:27.665 --> 50:29.625
and put it in the water.

50:47.507 --> 50:48.508
Come on!

51:14.230 --> 51:15.791
Hurry up!

51:26.832 --> 51:28.592
Come on!

51:54.875 --> 51:56.315
Rollie!

52:07.677 --> 52:09.117
God damn you!

52:09.237 --> 52:11.517
You've got to tell me what's going on!

52:12.997 --> 52:17.198
I killed a man. Three people have
tried to shoot me. And Ellen's dead.

52:53.162 --> 52:55.123
Did you knock?

52:57.643 --> 52:59.603
Try it.

53:06.404 --> 53:08.524
- Open up!
- I'm goin' for the tools.

53:09.324 --> 53:10.645
Open up in there!

53:18.645 --> 53:20.605
Put it away.

53:20.725 --> 53:25.086
- Let's get outta here. We're dirty in here.
- Relax. We're in here already.

53:25.207 --> 53:29.366
We'll look around. If we find anything,
then we'll phone down for a warrant.

53:31.167 --> 53:33.127
Jesus Christ!

53:35.687 --> 53:37.648
Look at this place.

53:44.848 --> 53:46.969
I told you.
He does special effects.

53:47.089 --> 53:49.449
I Dismember Mama.

53:50.849 --> 53:51.930
Great!

53:52.050 --> 53:54.890
You mean you paid good
money to look at this crap?

53:55.010 --> 53:57.810
What kind of a guy dreams
this shit up, Mickey?

53:59.530 --> 54:02.930
I mean, maybe this Tyler went nuts.
Look at how he lives.

54:03.050 --> 54:05.891
Hey, I've seen your apartment, Leo.
Remember?

54:07.692 --> 54:10.252
Maybe Mr Tyler got
tired of make-believe.

54:10.371 --> 54:12.852
Decided it was time
to try the real thing.

54:15.933 --> 54:18.292
I can't tell these from the real thing.

54:25.254 --> 54:26.373
Hey, Mickey.

54:26.493 --> 54:30.454
You remember the medical
examiner's report on the De Franco hit?

54:30.574 --> 54:34.535
Yeah. Six shots from a pistol.
Five to the chest, one to the head.

54:37.895 --> 54:40.775
- What the hell...?
- If only it could talk?

54:41.615 --> 54:46.896
You're not sayin' Tyler killed Ellen
Keith, Adams and De Franco all in one night?

54:48.936 --> 54:50.896
I don't believe it either.

55:15.540 --> 55:17.499
I believe you.

55:21.380 --> 55:23.340
I can't put the pieces together.

55:25.340 --> 55:27.701
First I'm hired to do a pretend murder.

55:29.461 --> 55:31.421
Then it's a real murder.

55:32.461 --> 55:35.422
And then the people that
hire me try to murder me.

55:36.222 --> 55:38.183
It doesn't make sense.

55:40.862 --> 55:43.822
And then I bring you into it.
I must be out of my mind.

55:44.463 --> 55:49.023
Now we've got to think what to do.
We've got to come up with something.

55:49.144 --> 55:51.103
We can't stay here for ever.

55:53.904 --> 55:55.865
Rollie, let's do something.

56:44.830 --> 56:46.390
Leo.

56:46.510 --> 56:48.150
Good morning, Velez.

56:48.991 --> 56:50.951
Whatcha got?

56:52.071 --> 56:54.031
I called a guy at FBI Central.

56:54.151 --> 56:57.512
He told me your friend
Adams, after he left NYPD,

56:57.632 --> 56:59.952
he joined the Justice Department.

57:00.592 --> 57:02.073
Morning, Marisa.

57:02.192 --> 57:04.113
Morning.

57:04.233 --> 57:07.153
Justice Department.
So that's what was N/A.

57:07.273 --> 57:11.514
And classified, and top
secret, and Christ knows what else.

57:15.273 --> 57:19.194
So... how did you get this guy
at the FBI to help you out?

57:20.394 --> 57:24.355
I told him I was going to Jamaica
for my vacation and needed some company.

57:27.195 --> 57:29.236
Justice Department?
That was it?

57:29.356 --> 57:31.916
No division? No phone number?
No address?

57:36.077 --> 57:38.036
That's all he said.

57:41.637 --> 57:43.358
Hey, Velez!

57:43.478 --> 57:48.037
Could you get me a breakdown of
Justice Department agencies on this thing?

57:49.598 --> 57:51.558
- Sure.
- Thank you.

57:55.959 --> 57:58.359
Antitrust... Attorney General...

57:58.479 --> 58:01.479
- What are you looking for?
- How the hell do I know?

58:01.599 --> 58:04.960
District Attorney, Immigration,
Naturalization,

58:05.080 --> 58:07.160
Interstate Traffic, Theft, WPR.

58:08.040 --> 58:10.000
What's WPR?

58:14.080 --> 58:15.841
Eu-fuckin'-reka!

58:20.362 --> 58:22.242
Come home to Jamaica.

58:22.362 --> 58:24.842
And have a helluva time!
Thanks a lot, Velez.

58:24.962 --> 58:26.322
Please hold.

58:26.442 --> 58:29.083
Colonel Mason, these men
have been waiting for you.

58:29.203 --> 58:31.003
- Mr Mason.
- Yes.

58:31.123 --> 58:32.923
I'm Lieutenant McCarthy, NYPD.

58:33.043 --> 58:35.684
This is my assistant, Detective Gaglione.

58:35.804 --> 58:37.403
How do you do?

58:37.523 --> 58:39.484
May we have a few minutes of your time?

58:39.604 --> 58:42.565
Sure. Follow along.
Tell me what I can do for you.

58:43.844 --> 58:47.485
Well... Do you know a William J Adams?

58:47.605 --> 58:50.045
Should I know a William J Adams?

58:50.165 --> 58:52.126
Joyce, will you hold my calls?

58:52.245 --> 58:54.245
Well, he works for you.

58:55.286 --> 58:57.606
253 people work for me.

58:57.726 --> 58:59.687
- Siddown.
- Thanks.

59:03.527 --> 59:05.487
Check the files for an Adams.

59:06.688 --> 59:08.647
William J.

59:09.928 --> 59:12.728
Now, sir, what's your
interest in this fella?

59:12.848 --> 59:15.048
He was found murdered this morning.

59:16.569 --> 59:18.049
Murdered?

59:18.169 --> 59:20.129
Well!
Boy, that's terrible.

59:20.249 --> 59:22.209
Have you any idea who did it?

59:22.329 --> 59:24.449
- Well, yeah. We found a guy...
- No.

59:26.010 --> 59:27.770
Yes, no.

59:27.890 --> 59:29.650
Thank you.

59:29.770 --> 59:33.170
Yes and no.
Let's see.

59:34.651 --> 59:39.011
No wonder I didn't recognise the name.
Adams was what we refer to as a floater.

59:41.932 --> 59:45.332
A floater is what we call a
body we pull out of the East River.

59:46.812 --> 59:49.853
Well, in our parlance a
floater is a freelancer.

59:49.972 --> 59:52.132
An agent with no direct duties.

59:52.252 --> 59:56.613
We used him for witness
relocation from time to time.

59:56.734 --> 59:59.614
Last time was way back in June of '83.

01:00:00.654 --> 01:00:02.614
And then...

01:00:03.734 --> 01:00:06.814
After that, there's no mention
of him except this.

01:00:07.614 --> 01:00:10.535
A below-standard
evaluation on his last assignment.

01:00:10.655 --> 01:00:14.296
My bet is that he didn't work out
and we just discontinued using him.

01:00:14.416 --> 01:00:17.735
Anything else?
Any request for references? Addresses?

01:00:17.856 --> 01:00:21.296
Just a notation here that
correspondence sent to him

01:00:21.417 --> 01:00:24.137
was returned with no forwarding address.

01:00:24.856 --> 01:00:27.137
I am sorry that I can't be of more help.

01:00:27.977 --> 01:00:29.937
We appreciate your cooperation.

01:00:30.058 --> 01:00:33.458
It's nothing. I just hope that
you find whoever killed him.

01:00:33.578 --> 01:00:35.137
We'll get 'em.

01:00:43.899 --> 01:00:46.259
Martin, would you come in here, please?

01:00:58.701 --> 01:01:00.661
So?
What do they know?

01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:03.341
So far they don't know a damn thing.

01:01:03.461 --> 01:01:06.462
But for how long?
That goddamn Tyler could sink us.

01:01:08.262 --> 01:01:10.542
We're gettin' outta here tonight.

01:01:10.662 --> 01:01:12.622
Get it organised.

01:01:13.223 --> 01:01:14.902
That got us nowhere.

01:01:15.023 --> 01:01:17.383
- I'm not so sure.
- What?

01:01:17.502 --> 01:01:20.463
- I think our nice Mr Mason is bent as hell.
- Come on!

01:01:20.583 --> 01:01:24.103
No. 1. Mason says he never
heard of William J Adams. Right?

01:01:24.223 --> 01:01:28.185
Adams is an ex-cop, pullin' a
black-bag operation for these people.

01:01:28.305 --> 01:01:30.505
He fucks it up and
he gets shit-canned.

01:01:30.625 --> 01:01:33.665
And Mason never even heard of him?
That's bullshit.

01:01:34.465 --> 01:01:38.426
No. 2. When I tell him Adams had been
murdered, Mason doesn't ask me how.

01:01:38.545 --> 01:01:41.786
Everybody, Mickey, has a
morbid sense of curiosity.

01:01:41.905 --> 01:01:44.466
- Of course.
- Everybody but Adams' old boss.

01:01:44.586 --> 01:01:46.186
It's a theory.

01:01:47.227 --> 01:01:49.186
Mason is definitely bent.

01:01:50.227 --> 01:01:52.588
How bent is something I'm gonna find out.

01:01:53.307 --> 01:01:55.548
Martin, one thing I forgot to mention.

01:01:55.667 --> 01:01:58.988
There's a Mr Tyler calling
for Colonel Mason.

01:02:01.108 --> 01:02:03.149
Tell him to keep holding for a second.

01:02:03.269 --> 01:02:06.429
- Keep him talking. I'll trace. What line?
- Line two.

01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:13.029
Tyler?

01:02:13.150 --> 01:02:14.949
This is Lipton.

01:02:15.550 --> 01:02:17.510
No, Mason isn't here.

01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:20.190
Well, we didn't really expect...

01:02:22.951 --> 01:02:26.871
Awful sorry about that, mate, but
if you knew all the details...

01:02:27.631 --> 01:02:29.592
Yeah, I'm listening.

01:02:29.952 --> 01:02:32.432
OK, you're absolutely right.
It is time.

01:02:32.552 --> 01:02:34.512
OK.
Listen, Tyler...

01:02:35.032 --> 01:02:36.752
I'm sure that can be arranged.

01:02:36.873 --> 01:02:39.072
Listen, would you hold for a second?

01:02:40.233 --> 01:02:45.153
He's in the building, for Chrissakes,
calling from a pay phone in the lobby!

01:03:02.316 --> 01:03:04.076
Where the hell are you, Tyler?!

01:03:05.436 --> 01:03:07.556
Remember why you hired me, Lipton.

01:03:07.676 --> 01:03:10.356
For my "particular genius".

01:03:11.117 --> 01:03:15.117
Meet me in 20 minutes exactly at
the corner of Bowery and Houston.

01:03:19.198 --> 01:03:21.157
Mason!
Did you hear that?

01:03:21.278 --> 01:03:23.518
Get him.
And make sure you finish him off!

01:03:28.559 --> 01:03:31.719
Tyler's in a phone booth at the
corner of Houston and Bowery.

01:03:56.042 --> 01:03:58.002
Just keep drivin'!

01:03:59.082 --> 01:04:01.043
Turn left and head east.

01:04:01.163 --> 01:04:02.923
Yeah, OK.

01:04:06.603 --> 01:04:08.363
This better be good.

01:04:08.483 --> 01:04:11.564
Forensic got the prints of
these two at 51st and 11th.

01:04:11.684 --> 01:04:15.084
- What happened there?
- A guy was blown away in a phone booth.

01:04:15.204 --> 01:04:19.405
- I don't see the connection...
- Look at their social security numbers.

01:04:19.525 --> 01:04:21.205
Whose social security numbers?

01:04:21.325 --> 01:04:23.965
The two men who killed the
guy in the phone booth.

01:04:24.846 --> 01:04:26.806
- Consecutive.
- Yeah, but look.

01:04:26.926 --> 01:04:31.286
Varrick was born in Maryland, Gallagher
in Idaho, and three years apart.

01:04:31.406 --> 01:04:34.246
How can their numbers
be consecutive unless...?

01:04:34.366 --> 01:04:36.127
Unless they're phonies.

01:04:36.247 --> 01:04:38.888
I thought: Who makes up
social security numbers?

01:04:39.008 --> 01:04:42.288
And I remembered you were looking
into witness relocation.

01:04:42.408 --> 01:04:44.808
This could be worth an
extra week in Jamaica.

01:04:44.927 --> 01:04:49.009
You couldn't be away from me that long.
That's very intelligent, Velez.

01:04:49.129 --> 01:04:51.169
Let's get our old friend Adams up there.

01:04:51.289 --> 01:04:54.249
Don't erase it.
Put 'em both up, like on a split screen.

01:04:54.369 --> 01:04:56.129
I can't.

01:04:56.249 --> 01:04:58.210
Let me take some notes.

01:04:59.089 --> 01:05:00.450
Leo...

01:05:02.170 --> 01:05:05.331
Shit. I never would've thought
of that in a million years.

01:05:06.610 --> 01:05:08.571
- It's consecutive.
- Bingo.

01:05:08.691 --> 01:05:12.451
That means they're all phoney and
they all work for the same guy.

01:05:12.571 --> 01:05:14.532
And I know who that guy is.

01:05:14.652 --> 01:05:16.012
Velez...

01:05:16.132 --> 01:05:18.092
You are a damn good cop.

01:05:19.252 --> 01:05:20.612
Thanks.

01:05:20.732 --> 01:05:22.692
Take all of Jamaica.

01:05:22.812 --> 01:05:25.053
And the Bronx and Staten Island, too.

01:05:49.655 --> 01:05:51.616
OK, give me the keys.

01:05:51.736 --> 01:05:53.696
- Look...
- I said the keys!

01:05:56.936 --> 01:05:58.897
I'll take that.

01:06:05.218 --> 01:06:07.177
- Get out!
- I'm comin'.

01:06:07.298 --> 01:06:09.258
I said out!

01:06:11.939 --> 01:06:13.898
- Look...
- Shut up!

01:06:15.619 --> 01:06:17.939
Andy, out.
Your turn to ride up front.

01:06:18.059 --> 01:06:19.819
You... get in.

01:06:19.939 --> 01:06:21.899
- Get in!
- Wait!

01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:26.220
I thought we were gonna talk!

01:06:29.381 --> 01:06:32.461
Now just sit there and
don't ask any questions.

01:06:32.581 --> 01:06:34.021
Lipton?

01:06:34.141 --> 01:06:36.102
I want Mason's address!

01:06:36.222 --> 01:06:38.382
Go fuck yourself, Tyler!

01:06:38.502 --> 01:06:40.862
All right, have it your own way!

01:06:40.982 --> 01:06:42.942
Put your belt on.

01:06:50.983 --> 01:06:52.944
Tyler!
Are you crazy?!

01:06:58.904 --> 01:07:01.144
- Are you all right?
- You're killin' me!

01:07:13.906 --> 01:07:15.466
Wait a minute!

01:07:18.587 --> 01:07:22.667
- Now tell me where Mason is!
- For Christ's sake, Tyler, I don't know!

01:07:22.787 --> 01:07:24.707
Maybe this'll jog your memory!

01:07:28.948 --> 01:07:30.748
Wait a minute!
Wait!

01:07:32.148 --> 01:07:33.708
You still alive?

01:07:33.828 --> 01:07:36.389
How about you, Lipton?
Havin' a good time?

01:07:45.870 --> 01:07:47.830
All right!
Stop! Please!

01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:51.670
OK, Lipton!

01:07:51.790 --> 01:07:54.871
- You wanna talk now?
- All right! All right.

01:07:54.991 --> 01:07:56.951
So where does Mason live?!

01:07:57.071 --> 01:08:00.232
- Colonel Mason isn't here.
- Then I need his home address.

01:08:00.351 --> 01:08:01.831
That's classified.

01:08:01.951 --> 01:08:04.912
Lady, I don't give a shit if
it's tattooed on your ass.

01:08:05.032 --> 01:08:07.592
- I'm not playin' around here!
- She doesn't know!

01:08:07.712 --> 01:08:12.072
The colonel's home address is strictly
confidential. You should know that.

01:08:12.193 --> 01:08:14.953
A recognisable face!
Where does your boss live?

01:08:15.074 --> 01:08:19.194
- That is strictly on a need-to-know basis.
- Believe me, darling, I need to know!

01:08:19.314 --> 01:08:22.514
I'd hate to see you be
made accessory to four murders.

01:08:22.634 --> 01:08:25.314
Are you trying to
threaten me or charm me?

01:08:25.434 --> 01:08:28.113
- Whatever.
- Don't you consult with your associates?

01:08:28.234 --> 01:08:31.314
I believe Lieutenant
Murdoch has that information.

01:08:31.435 --> 01:08:33.996
He may even have it tattooed on his ass.

01:08:34.116 --> 01:08:35.636
You're a sweetheart.

01:08:35.756 --> 01:08:38.916
I think there's a
connection but we have to check it out.

01:08:39.036 --> 01:08:40.996
It's gonna take a lot of...

01:08:46.676 --> 01:08:51.557
Ladies and gentlemen, if you'd give me
a few minutes with Lieutenant McCarthy...

01:08:55.598 --> 01:08:57.559
- Cool it, Leo.
- Up yours.

01:09:03.279 --> 01:09:07.040
- Leo, what the hell do you want?
- I need to see De Franco's file.

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:09.679
For Chrissakes!
Don't you ever give up?

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:14.120
Listen, you fuckin' creep!
I got no time to fuck around with you.

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:17.720
You break out De Franco's
file or I'll rip out your throat.

01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:20.520
- It's on the desk.
- Thank you.

01:09:21.761 --> 01:09:23.801
You read that right here in this office.

01:09:23.921 --> 01:09:27.682
You bought yourself some trouble now.
You just closed your own case.

01:09:27.801 --> 01:09:29.721
This is the end!
You buried yourself!

01:09:29.841 --> 01:09:34.523
Where the hell do you think you're
goin' with that?! McCarthy? McCarthy!

01:09:34.643 --> 01:09:36.203
Leo, wait a minute.

01:09:36.323 --> 01:09:39.283
- Guess what I just found.
- No guesses, Mickey. What?

01:09:39.403 --> 01:09:41.363
Tyler's truck.
It's in the pound.

01:09:41.483 --> 01:09:44.604
- They'll call me if he shows up.
- No, go there and sit on it.

01:10:00.766 --> 01:10:03.086
There you go, Jim.
Pick a good one for me?

01:10:03.206 --> 01:10:05.167
- Sure.
- I'll catch up with you later.

01:10:05.287 --> 01:10:07.246
Watch out for the jumpers, Joe.

01:10:15.767 --> 01:10:18.328
- Let me use your phone for a minute.
- Sure.

01:10:35.250 --> 01:10:37.371
- Hello?
- Is Mr Mason there?

01:10:37.491 --> 01:10:38.970
Who's calling?

01:10:39.890 --> 01:10:43.211
- Let me speak to Lipton.
- Lipton isn't here. Who's this?

01:10:43.331 --> 01:10:45.011
I'll bet it's Tyler.

01:10:45.931 --> 01:10:49.092
Tyler, you son of a bitch!
You're dead!

01:10:53.212 --> 01:10:55.173
Son of a bitch.

01:10:55.893 --> 01:10:57.853
Are you crazy?

01:10:57.972 --> 01:11:00.613
In three hours you'll
be out of the country.

01:11:00.733 --> 01:11:04.133
But if one person - one
person - suspects, it's over.

01:11:04.254 --> 01:11:06.294
Tyler knows.
Why else would he call?

01:11:06.414 --> 01:11:09.334
He doesn't know!
He'd have gone to the police if he knew.

01:11:09.974 --> 01:11:12.494
He thinks he killed you!
Don't you understand?

01:11:28.897 --> 01:11:30.417
All right, all right!

01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:02.260
Get me the smoke pots like the
ones we used in Hellraisers.

01:12:02.381 --> 01:12:03.821
You got it!

01:12:32.224 --> 01:12:33.744
Hey, officer!

01:12:33.864 --> 01:12:36.505
- What can I do for you?
- That's my car over there.

01:12:36.625 --> 01:12:38.584
- Check in the office.
- Thanks.

01:12:48.306 --> 01:12:52.267
- Can I see your driver's licence, please?
- Yeah, I got it right here.

01:13:09.229 --> 01:13:10.709
Over there.
Let's go.

01:13:45.753 --> 01:13:48.273
Central, this is car 714, homicide squad.

01:13:48.393 --> 01:13:51.034
I'm at the 12th Avenue car pound.

01:13:53.433 --> 01:13:55.994
- Jesus! What pots did you use?
- The big ones.

01:13:56.114 --> 01:13:57.594
I said Hellraisers, not Killer Smoke!

01:14:18.437 --> 01:14:20.117
This is car 714.

01:14:20.237 --> 01:14:23.757
I'm in pursuit of a blue step van.
Letters on the side: F as in Frank,

01:14:23.877 --> 01:14:25.358
X as in X-ray.

01:14:25.478 --> 01:14:28.478
Heading south on 12th
Avenue approaching Canal Street.

01:14:28.598 --> 01:14:31.838
- I got a possible murder suspect.
- Car 224 will assist.

01:14:37.319 --> 01:14:39.080
Christ, we got company.

01:14:39.839 --> 01:14:41.680
What do we do?

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:44.640
Open the back.

01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:46.280
You got it.

01:14:52.121 --> 01:14:54.041
Remember Skidball Express?

01:14:54.162 --> 01:14:56.401
- I sure do!
- Then get ready!

01:15:01.202 --> 01:15:03.042
Get out of the road!

01:15:16.084 --> 01:15:19.164
- As I turn left at the next corner!
- You're on!

01:15:23.404 --> 01:15:24.165
Now!

01:15:31.765 --> 01:15:32.766
We got 'em!

01:15:32.886 --> 01:15:33.966
Shit!

01:15:36.526 --> 01:15:37.366
Jesus!

01:15:42.167 --> 01:15:43.527
Madonna!

01:15:46.327 --> 01:15:47.848
Hold on, Andy!

01:16:07.450 --> 01:16:09.330
Hang on there!

01:16:10.410 --> 01:16:11.370
Rollie!

01:16:25.612 --> 01:16:27.572
Thank God, a street!

01:16:29.813 --> 01:16:33.053
There he is.
Got ya, you bastard!

01:16:43.174 --> 01:16:44.775
We're gonna crash!

01:16:45.415 --> 01:16:47.375
Get out of the road!

01:16:53.095 --> 01:16:54.415
Bloody hell!

01:16:54.535 --> 01:16:56.936
- Andy, are you all right?
- Yes!

01:16:59.096 --> 01:17:01.737
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby.

01:17:12.978 --> 01:17:14.378
What next?

01:17:14.498 --> 01:17:17.379
- Remember The Mannequin Depression?
- Yeah!

01:17:17.498 --> 01:17:19.378
At the next corner, send Nelly in!

01:17:31.660 --> 01:17:33.620
We got him.
We got him!

01:17:36.821 --> 01:17:38.061
Shoot!

01:17:46.662 --> 01:17:48.142
No!
No!

01:17:49.503 --> 01:17:50.863
Oh, my God!

01:17:52.262 --> 01:17:56.823
- What's goin' on, lieutenant?
- Shit! Oh, shit!

01:17:56.943 --> 01:17:59.504
What's happenin' over here?

01:18:00.304 --> 01:18:02.263
Great.
Just great.

01:18:02.384 --> 01:18:04.264
Shit!

01:18:04.384 --> 01:18:08.024
- All right, let's hear it. Is this a dummy?
- Yeah, it's a dummy!

01:18:09.824 --> 01:18:11.785
What's up?

01:18:11.905 --> 01:18:13.865
I wish I could've seen his face.

01:18:15.185 --> 01:18:17.146
Yeah, me too.

01:18:23.467 --> 01:18:25.426
- Damn.
- What?

01:18:30.348 --> 01:18:32.307
Rollie, what is it?
A flat?

01:18:44.909 --> 01:18:47.189
Rollie, you son of a bitch!

01:18:47.309 --> 01:18:49.149
They'll kill you!

01:18:49.790 --> 01:18:51.629
And if they don't, I will!

01:19:04.711 --> 01:19:06.352
Wallenger.

01:19:07.111 --> 01:19:09.152
Yeah, all right.
But make it fast.

01:19:11.392 --> 01:19:13.953
- McCarthy.
- Tyler stole his van.

01:19:14.073 --> 01:19:16.513
We totalled three of
our cars and lost him.

01:19:16.633 --> 01:19:18.393
Son of a bitch!

01:19:18.513 --> 01:19:20.473
Congratulations, Mickey.

01:19:23.114 --> 01:19:25.473
Jake... Nick De Franco's alive.

01:19:27.074 --> 01:19:29.435
If he's alive, who's
sittin' in the morgue?

01:19:29.555 --> 01:19:32.155
Who knows? Some stiff.
Jake, we can stop him.

01:19:32.275 --> 01:19:35.235
- But we don't have much time.
- You got nothin' but time.

01:19:35.355 --> 01:19:37.516
- You don't understand.
- I understand!

01:19:37.635 --> 01:19:40.195
You couldn't stay away from De Franco!

01:19:40.315 --> 01:19:43.676
- There was an overlap.
- You get an overlap, you come to me.

01:19:43.796 --> 01:19:47.637
- Who are you to strong-arm Murdoch?
- All right, I fucked up! I apologise!

01:19:47.757 --> 01:19:50.477
- Now can I get back to work?
- Sit the hell down.

01:19:54.757 --> 01:19:56.917
Haven't you figured it out yet?

01:19:57.037 --> 01:19:59.318
Why do you think they're here?

01:20:01.118 --> 01:20:03.758
What are you gonna do?
Take away my pension?

01:20:03.878 --> 01:20:06.519
Pension?
You'll be lucky to stay out of jail.

01:20:06.639 --> 01:20:08.599
Coercion of a fellow officer,

01:20:08.719 --> 01:20:12.559
criminal trespass, dereliction of duty...

01:20:12.679 --> 01:20:16.360
Jake, it's Nicky De Franco, for
Christ's sake. He's gettin' away!

01:20:16.479 --> 01:20:18.440
I want a status report.

01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:22.041
After which... you'll sit down
with Murdoch and fill him in.

01:20:22.161 --> 01:20:23.921
After which... you go home.

01:20:26.202 --> 01:20:29.361
As of... 5:30 this afternoon,

01:20:29.482 --> 01:20:31.041
you're suspended.

01:20:32.202 --> 01:20:34.162
Is that clear?

01:20:34.762 --> 01:20:37.602
What the hell are you talkin' about, Jake?

01:20:37.722 --> 01:20:39.723
You're not one of these guys.

01:20:40.602 --> 01:20:43.163
I can't cover for you any more, Leo.

01:20:45.963 --> 01:20:47.524
Jake...

01:20:48.324 --> 01:20:50.524
Come on.
This is me, Jake.

01:20:51.084 --> 01:20:53.084
This job is all I got.

01:20:54.724 --> 01:20:56.685
Please.

01:20:57.765 --> 01:20:59.725
You brought this on yourself.

01:21:04.006 --> 01:21:06.286
I'll take your shield and your piece.

01:21:27.808 --> 01:21:29.769
Jake...

01:21:38.570 --> 01:21:40.170
Leo?

01:21:43.410 --> 01:21:45.371
Are you all right?

01:21:45.490 --> 01:21:47.451
Yeah.

01:22:05.533 --> 01:22:07.494
Took it like a man, didn't he?

01:22:09.853 --> 01:22:11.574
Murdoch...

01:22:11.694 --> 01:22:13.974
You're an asshole.

01:22:16.174 --> 01:22:18.134
So what's so goddamn funny?

01:22:19.174 --> 01:22:21.695
Your jacket.

01:24:27.790 --> 01:24:29.750
Shit!
What was that?

01:24:30.670 --> 01:24:32.631
Check it out.

01:24:33.751 --> 01:24:35.712
Mitchell!

01:24:36.751 --> 01:24:38.712
Check it out.

01:24:47.913 --> 01:24:49.473
Roy!

01:24:50.673 --> 01:24:52.273
Roy!

01:25:25.277 --> 01:25:29.197
- What's goin' on out there?
- I'll tell you. It's your pal, Tyler.

01:25:29.998 --> 01:25:32.838
I'll bet he wasted your two guys outside.
And Lipton.

01:25:32.958 --> 01:25:35.158
He'd never get through the secur...

01:25:36.038 --> 01:25:39.519
- I'm gettin' the fuck out.
- Siddown. The chopper's coming.

01:25:39.639 --> 01:25:42.119
You're the one he's after.
He thinks I'm dead!

01:25:42.239 --> 01:25:44.120
What difference does that make?

01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:47.640
- What do we do? Just wait for him?
- Damn right! It's all we can do.

01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:49.280
Now siddown!

01:26:45.767 --> 01:26:47.727
Jesus Christ.
He cut the wiring.

01:26:47.847 --> 01:26:51.047
He still doesn't know the
house or what room we're in.

01:26:51.647 --> 01:26:54.207
Asshole.
"He doesn't know what room we're in"?

01:26:54.327 --> 01:26:58.048
The light's still on in the hall!
He's playin' with the fuse box!

01:26:58.168 --> 01:27:00.889
- He's inside your fucking house!
- Shut up!

01:27:59.136 --> 01:28:01.095
Hey, take this hallway.

01:28:08.216 --> 01:28:09.497
Damn!

01:29:14.584 --> 01:29:17.945
Hey, Eddie!
He's playin' games with us.

01:29:40.067 --> 01:29:41.468
Gallagher!

01:29:41.588 --> 01:29:43.308
Varrick!

01:29:43.428 --> 01:29:45.789
There goes two more of your tough guys.

01:29:48.069 --> 01:29:50.348
Maybe he's gonna come lookin' for us.

01:29:50.469 --> 01:29:52.429
Yeah?
Well, let him come.

01:29:53.470 --> 01:29:56.190
I'll show him who the
fuck he's dealin' with.

01:29:59.230 --> 01:30:00.751
What's the matter, Mason?

01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:02.830
You look a little nervous.

01:30:13.192 --> 01:30:16.152
Jesus Christ.
Are you the only backup I'm gonna get?

01:30:16.272 --> 01:30:19.393
No. The rest are on the way.
I was just a mile down the road.

01:30:19.513 --> 01:30:23.313
- Are you Captain Wallenger?
- Yeah. We gotta bust this gate open.

01:30:23.433 --> 01:30:26.993
We can't unless you find something.
Did you find something?

01:30:29.874 --> 01:30:31.834
Jesus Christ, I guess you did.

01:31:00.597 --> 01:31:01.758
Son of a...!

01:31:26.681 --> 01:31:28.640
A helicopter!
I'm impressed.

01:31:28.761 --> 01:31:31.121
So am I.
We don't have any.

01:31:33.521 --> 01:31:35.401
Let's get the fuck outta here!

01:31:47.723 --> 01:31:49.203
My pace...

01:31:49.324 --> 01:31:51.283
Pacemaker!

01:31:53.883 --> 01:31:56.044
The key.
Where's the key?

01:31:56.164 --> 01:31:59.045
- Eddie... help me.
- Nick, the key first.

01:31:59.804 --> 01:32:01.844
Key... inside.

01:32:04.565 --> 01:32:07.406
Eddie, please!

01:32:13.086 --> 01:32:14.646
For God's sake...

01:32:22.807 --> 01:32:24.887
Attention inside the house.

01:32:25.007 --> 01:32:27.408
This is the police.
We have the place surrounded.

01:32:27.528 --> 01:32:31.648
Drop your guns and come out
the front door one at a time.

01:32:39.809 --> 01:32:40.769
Mason!

01:32:41.930 --> 01:32:43.249
Oh, my God.

01:32:45.450 --> 01:32:48.090
What's the matter?
Forget why you hired me?

01:32:50.891 --> 01:32:53.851
You son of a gun.
You faked us out.

01:32:54.971 --> 01:32:56.931
- Rollie...
- Don't move.

01:32:57.052 --> 01:32:59.011
See this key?

01:32:59.131 --> 01:33:01.652
This key is worth
15 million dollars -

01:33:01.772 --> 01:33:06.213
all the money De Franco
stole for the Mob over the years.

01:33:06.333 --> 01:33:11.053
It's all stowed away in a safe-deposit
box at the Royal Bank in Geneva.

01:33:14.574 --> 01:33:16.133
15 million dollars.

01:33:16.254 --> 01:33:17.454
Ours.

01:33:17.574 --> 01:33:19.534
But you need me to get it.

01:33:19.654 --> 01:33:22.614
Because only De Franco
and I are known in Geneva.

01:33:23.775 --> 01:33:27.135
You have one minute to leave the house.

01:33:30.175 --> 01:33:32.136
Listen, we can still get out.

01:33:32.256 --> 01:33:36.376
I know a way but we gotta move fast.
If we go through the basement...

01:33:37.777 --> 01:33:40.377
Rollie, will you get moving?
We gotta go.

01:33:42.977 --> 01:33:45.377
- Rollie...
- No, it'll never work, Mason.

01:33:54.258 --> 01:33:57.698
- I'll take that key, Rollie.
- There's something you should know.

01:33:57.818 --> 01:33:59.779
Gimme the key, Rollie.

01:33:59.899 --> 01:34:03.339
In this hand... is the ammo for the gun.

01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:06.459
And this... is Krazy Glue.

01:34:06.579 --> 01:34:08.140
A thousand and one uses.

01:34:10.420 --> 01:34:12.380
Now a thousand and two.

01:34:12.500 --> 01:34:14.660
No!
No!

01:34:15.821 --> 01:34:18.821
- Mason! Drop the gun!
- No, don't shoot!

01:34:18.941 --> 01:34:20.341
It's a mistake!
Don't shoot!

01:34:30.943 --> 01:34:32.503
Shit!

01:34:34.783 --> 01:34:37.063
A couple of you check upstairs.

01:34:37.183 --> 01:34:39.144
Careful now.
Be careful.

01:34:39.264 --> 01:34:41.664
Somebody call an ambulance.

01:34:46.945 --> 01:34:48.905
This guy's gone.

01:34:50.185 --> 01:34:51.865
Too bad, Rollie.

01:34:52.626 --> 01:34:54.585
It's not like the movies.

01:35:07.387 --> 01:35:09.507
Please, just tell me he's not dead.

01:35:09.628 --> 01:35:11.587
He's dead.

01:35:27.789 --> 01:35:30.710
- The body's in the bag. In the house.
- Thanks.

01:35:30.830 --> 01:35:34.110
The shit's gonna hit the fan.
Bag 'em and get 'em outta here.

01:35:34.230 --> 01:35:36.871
- Hey, where's that cop from New York?
- What cop?

01:35:36.991 --> 01:35:38.671
What's his name... Wallenger.

01:37:39.886 --> 01:37:43.166
They don't want anybody to
touch 'em till the ME gets here.

01:37:43.286 --> 01:37:45.126
- Nobody. Got it?
- Yes, sir.

01:38:10.969 --> 01:38:12.929
Hiya, Rollie.

01:38:13.050 --> 01:38:15.009
My name's Leo.

01:38:15.129 --> 01:38:17.090
We need to talk.

01:39:23.898 --> 01:39:25.859
Any problems?

01:39:25.978 --> 01:39:28.739
None.

01:39:28.859 --> 01:39:31.739
There's enough in there
for your pension, Leo.

01:39:31.859 --> 01:39:36.059
Well, I'm gonna miss the job, but
this should ease the pain somewhat.

01:39:36.179 --> 01:39:39.220
You'll never have to put that
shit on your face again.

01:39:39.340 --> 01:39:41.300
I dunno, Leo.

01:39:41.420 --> 01:39:43.620
It's hard for me to do anything else.
