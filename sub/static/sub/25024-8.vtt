[theme music playing]

00:24.858 --> 00:25.859
[roaring]

00:40.790 --> 00:42.250
[roars]

00:45.295 --> 00:47.297
[rocks rumbling]

00:47.714 --> 00:49.424
[Aaarrrgghh!!! grunting]

00:50.550 --> 00:54.471
-Too big.
-It's okay, wingman. You tried.

00:54.554 --> 01:00.060
It's hardly okay. We're on the distinctly
wrong side of the cavern's collapse.

01:00.143 --> 01:02.771
Merlin's tomb
will now apparently become our own.

01:02.854 --> 01:04.480
[grunting, panting]

01:08.234 --> 01:09.444
[Claire grunts]

01:11.613 --> 01:14.783
-[Toby whimpers]
-[rumbling]

01:15.492 --> 01:18.411
Or we could just go that way.
There's an opening.

01:18.495 --> 01:21.623
Thus affording us the opportunity
to be trapped somewhere else.

01:21.706 --> 01:25.001
Or it's a way out, huh?
You just gotta think positive.

01:25.084 --> 01:27.378
I'm not entirely sure I know how.

01:27.462 --> 01:29.964
[Aaarrrgghh!!! grunts]

01:33.009 --> 01:38.264
-We can't leave him behind like this.
-Draal would want us to keep going.

01:40.350 --> 01:41.893
[rocks rumbling]

01:41.976 --> 01:44.395
[grunts]

01:44.479 --> 01:47.649
-Um, this isn't taking us out.
-[grunts]

01:49.234 --> 01:51.903
[grunts] We need to find a way to go up.

01:51.986 --> 01:56.074
Hmm. Right. Yeah, look for some stairs.
Or better yet, an elevator.

01:56.616 --> 01:57.450
[grunts]

01:57.534 --> 01:58.368
Oh!

02:01.830 --> 02:03.248
[groans]

02:03.832 --> 02:04.666
That way.

02:11.589 --> 02:13.675
Whoa!

02:13.758 --> 02:16.177
Great Globus, it's him.

02:16.261 --> 02:20.140
-[Claire] Is it really?
-[Aaarrrgghh!!!] Must be.

02:21.599 --> 02:22.642
[Jim] Merlin.

02:57.802 --> 02:59.053
[heartbeat thumping]

03:05.226 --> 03:07.437
-[Jim shrieks]
-[gasps]

03:07.520 --> 03:08.730
[coughs]

03:12.734 --> 03:15.153
-[pants]
-[Merlin continues coughing]

03:17.530 --> 03:18.364
[sighs]

03:19.949 --> 03:21.659
Are you the Trollhunter?

03:21.743 --> 03:23.119
Um, uh...

03:23.202 --> 03:24.996
-I thought you'd be taller.
-Um...

03:25.079 --> 03:28.583
Yes, I expected much taller. And older.

03:29.083 --> 03:32.295
-How old are you? Ten?
-Uh, sixteen.

03:32.921 --> 03:38.426
I guess I was only off by, mmm...
Six plus four, carry the one...

03:39.093 --> 03:40.762
Fourteen years.

03:40.845 --> 03:45.308
Holy Merlin. It's really you!

03:45.391 --> 03:49.562
-Just what kind of troll are you?
-I'm not a troll! I'm a Toby.

03:49.646 --> 03:51.314
And who is this lovely creature?

03:51.397 --> 03:54.108
-[Claire chuckles]
-Blinkous Galadrigal, at your ser--

03:54.192 --> 03:55.860
Not you. You.

03:56.527 --> 04:01.199
-Uh, Claire Nuñez, sir.
-A pleasure, my dear.

04:01.282 --> 04:03.576
Oh, she gets to be "my dear."

04:03.660 --> 04:05.828
-Your sageness, we--
-[bones crackle]

04:05.912 --> 04:07.497
[Merlin sighs]

04:08.998 --> 04:15.672
-One more. Ah... Oh, yes. That's better.
-He was asleep for a really long time.

04:15.755 --> 04:19.384
-He was just sleeping? Shouldn't he be...
-Well rested?

04:19.466 --> 04:22.011
-Dead?
-[Blinky] True, but he is a wizard.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.097
-Ooh!
-[gasps]

04:24.180 --> 04:25.014
-Oop!
-Hmm.

04:25.098 --> 04:28.017
Prop me up, would you, you giant thing.

04:28.893 --> 04:30.645
-[grunts]
-[bones crackle]

04:32.146 --> 04:33.147
[grunts]

04:33.231 --> 04:36.693
-I seriously don't wanna be old.
-[grunts] Oh, that's good.

04:43.366 --> 04:44.492
[exhales]

04:46.452 --> 04:50.623
Okay, then, first things first.
Where might my staff be?

04:50.707 --> 04:51.749
Um...

04:51.833 --> 04:58.256
Staff of Avalon? About yea high?
Emerald at the top. It is rather dashing.

04:58.339 --> 05:01.968
We might have lost it a little.

05:02.051 --> 05:04.345
-[stammers] Lost it a little?
-Gunmar took it.

05:04.429 --> 05:09.684
Oh, is that all? Well, it's not the staff
that's lost, then. Just hope.

05:10.601 --> 05:11.436
[gasps]

05:13.062 --> 05:16.482
How'd you know we were gonna come
looking for you? I mean, your staff?

05:17.066 --> 05:21.070
Because, Jim, I am your father.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.405
[gasps]

05:22.488 --> 05:23.948
[all gasp]

05:25.325 --> 05:27.785
Kidding! [chuckles]

05:27.869 --> 05:31.706
I can glimpse the future.
It's not a perfect gift, though.

05:31.789 --> 05:34.625
-You expected me to be older.
-And taller.

05:34.709 --> 05:37.837
Clearly, he foresaw our arrival here
to rouse him from his slumber.

05:37.920 --> 05:42.133
-Why were you sleeping in the first place?
-It was the cost of battle, my dear.

05:42.216 --> 05:45.178
-What battle?
-The Battle of Killahead, of course.

05:45.261 --> 05:47.055
Excuse me, your wizard-ness,

05:47.138 --> 05:49.640
but Aaarrrgghh!!! and I were present
at Killahead,

05:49.724 --> 05:52.977
and neither of us recall seeing you there.

05:53.061 --> 05:53.895
Hmm.

05:53.978 --> 05:58.066
And I've read volume upon volume
of history books, and none mention--

05:58.149 --> 06:01.611
History is just an account
of what supposedly happened,

06:01.694 --> 06:06.074
but it's rarely the full story, if ever.

06:06.157 --> 06:09.869
-What's this now?
-I'm opening a window to the past.

06:09.952 --> 06:13.581
[Toby] This is gonna be very cool
if we don't end up dying.

06:16.709 --> 06:18.127
Whoa, cool. Hmm.

06:18.836 --> 06:21.881
-Where are we?
-Still in the Geode Caverns.

06:21.964 --> 06:25.760
-This is all an illusion.
-I've been here.

06:25.843 --> 06:30.389
Great Gorka,
this is the forest of Killahead.

06:30.473 --> 06:33.142
[Merlin]
As well as I remember it, at least.

06:35.186 --> 06:37.730
-[fighter grunting]
-[clamoring]

06:40.817 --> 06:42.401
[Jim] And there's Deya.

06:42.485 --> 06:45.988
[Blinky] At the very moment she dealt
the blow that decided the battle!

06:46.072 --> 06:50.827
Deya the Deliverer was the mightiest
Trollhunter that ever lived.

06:50.910 --> 06:53.162
Awesome-sauce!

06:53.246 --> 06:55.832
[Toby squealing]

06:59.585 --> 07:01.337
[Jim] Whoa.

07:04.465 --> 07:06.425
[grunting]

07:06.509 --> 07:09.762
I remember this like it was yesterday.

07:09.846 --> 07:13.683
It was a proud moment, for we fought
as if there were no tomorrow.

07:13.766 --> 07:15.435
Look! There you are.

07:15.518 --> 07:17.395
[Blinky screaming]

07:17.478 --> 07:22.150
Um, no-- No, this is someone else. Now,
if we just turn our attention over here...

07:22.233 --> 07:27.029
Hey! Hey, Claire! Watch this! Wham!
Quick, take a picture!

07:27.113 --> 07:29.323
[Jim and Toby laughing]

07:29.407 --> 07:31.325
[swords clanking]

07:31.409 --> 07:32.493
Vendel.

07:32.577 --> 07:34.829
[fighters grunting]

07:45.590 --> 07:46.507
[Jim] Draal.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.763
I'm so sorry.

08:05.193 --> 08:10.948
Come now. There is more to see.
The real battle is over this way.

08:11.949 --> 08:13.409
[Gunmar] Where is it?

08:17.830 --> 08:19.749
[rumbling]

08:19.832 --> 08:22.627
[panting, grunting]

08:24.670 --> 08:25.922
[grunts]

08:26.005 --> 08:27.089
Gunmar.

08:35.097 --> 08:38.100
[trolls] Gunmar! Gunmar! Gunmar!

08:38.183 --> 08:41.437
[clamoring]

08:44.273 --> 08:47.235
The quest ends triumphant!

08:47.318 --> 08:53.157
See here the instrument
of our ascension, the Staff of Avalon.

08:53.241 --> 08:57.995
Merlin's tool holds the key
to our long-awaited victory.

08:58.079 --> 09:04.085
Soon, the Eternal Night will fall
and with it, the world!

09:04.168 --> 09:05.586
[all cheering]

09:06.170 --> 09:10.299
[trolls] Gunmar! Gunmar! Gunmar!

09:28.818 --> 09:32.029
[gasps] They're all dead!
Our children are dead!

09:32.113 --> 09:34.907
-There, there.
-Let's not jump to any conclusions.

09:34.991 --> 09:39.161
-All they've done is not text us.
-Exactly! They're teenagers!

09:39.245 --> 09:43.916
-Nothing stops them from texting!
-Unless Gunmar chopped off their hands.

09:44.000 --> 09:49.922
Or their cute little fingers were eaten,
and they have no way to type or call us!

09:50.006 --> 09:52.508
-We can't panic.
-Oh, watch me!

09:52.592 --> 09:55.720
I know my son. Trust me, they're safe.

09:55.803 --> 09:59.890
My Toby Pie was made into a human pie!
[sobs]

09:59.974 --> 10:03.769
-[Mrs. Nuñez] Our children are dead!
-[sighs] Excuse me for a moment.

10:04.353 --> 10:05.521
[Mrs. Nuñez sobbing]

10:12.987 --> 10:13.821
[sighs]

10:15.615 --> 10:16.449
[sobs]

10:18.993 --> 10:20.745
[sighs] Nothing.

10:23.831 --> 10:25.249
-Barbara.
-[sighs]

10:25.333 --> 10:27.793
You're the last person I wanna talk to.

10:27.877 --> 10:31.005
You're doing an excellent job
of maintaining calm.

10:31.088 --> 10:33.799
If anyone has the capacity
to survive the unknown...

10:33.883 --> 10:35.051
-[knocking]
-...it's Jim.

10:35.134 --> 10:36.052
Code red!

10:36.135 --> 10:37.762
-What is it?
-The police!

10:37.845 --> 10:39.347
[knocking on door continues]

10:39.430 --> 10:41.932
-Oh, no. This is bad.
-[gasps] Oh, dear!

10:42.016 --> 10:45.561
-What is he doing here?
-What are we all looking at?

10:45.645 --> 10:46.896
[grunts]

10:46.979 --> 10:51.525
-Just get him upstairs.
-Oh! What are you doing?

10:52.443 --> 10:57.657
Okay, just open the door and act natural.

10:59.241 --> 11:01.243
-Hello.
-[in singsong manner] Hello!

11:02.370 --> 11:05.581
Hey, folks. It's funny, I wasn't sure
if there was anyone home,

11:05.665 --> 11:07.458
but I saw cars parked outside.

11:07.541 --> 11:09.210
Well, what did you hear?

11:09.293 --> 11:13.464
-[chuckles]
-I mean, you know, out of curiosity.

11:14.048 --> 11:16.967
Hey, is that a flyer
for the Battle of the Bands?

11:17.051 --> 11:20.679
Yeah. The mayor thinks it's cool to
draft the police into passing these out.

11:20.763 --> 11:24.016
-Supposed to raise money for the city.
-Thank you so much.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.185
We'll make sure our children
save the date.

11:26.268 --> 11:28.729
-Have a nice day now.
-Wait. What's that?

11:28.813 --> 11:30.356
-[Barbara] What's what?
-Up there.

11:30.439 --> 11:33.192
Don't you need a warrant or something
to come inside?

11:33.275 --> 11:34.860
[grunting]

11:34.944 --> 11:35.861
[gasping]

11:36.529 --> 11:37.363
[grunts softly]

11:37.446 --> 11:39.323
Detective Scott here. [grunts]

11:40.449 --> 11:41.700
[Dictatious] Oh.

11:41.784 --> 11:45.955
Oh, don't be such a bunch of daisies.
Help me move the body. [chuckles]

11:46.038 --> 11:46.872
[snoring]

11:46.956 --> 11:51.460
-[Barbara] What were you thinking?
-I took decisive action. I've no regrets.

11:51.544 --> 11:54.922
-Not you.
-Though you did assault a police officer.

11:55.005 --> 11:58.801
-You were supposed to stay upstairs.
-And now, our goose is cooked.

11:58.884 --> 12:01.595
We have to focus.
He's going to wake up eventually

12:01.679 --> 12:03.889
and we're going to have to explain
what he saw.

12:03.973 --> 12:06.934
-I have an idea!
-We're not going to kill him.

12:07.017 --> 12:09.103
In that case, I don't have an idea.

12:09.186 --> 12:12.398
What if we just pretend nothing happened?

12:12.481 --> 12:14.859
That he didn't actually see anything?

12:14.942 --> 12:17.611
Yeah, I don't think any of us can
act that well, Nana.

12:17.695 --> 12:21.866
[gasps] That's it. Quick, I need paper
and something to write with.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.368
While you were focused on the battle,

12:24.452 --> 12:27.913
there were events unfolding
that you were unaware of.

12:27.997 --> 12:31.459
I suppose fighting for our lives
would be a little distracting.

12:36.255 --> 12:42.386
-[Claire] What? That's her! That's--
-Morgana. Yes, the Pale Lady.

12:42.470 --> 12:46.348
-The Mother of Monsters.
-Ugh! I could add more names to that list.

12:46.432 --> 12:51.145
-None of the history books speak of this.
-Well, books don't talk, for one thing.

12:51.854 --> 12:56.901
-This was the true battle of Killahead.
-You and Morgana?

12:56.984 --> 13:00.654
She is as ancient as I am,
perhaps more so.

13:01.238 --> 13:06.535
Craving chaos, she sowed the seeds of
dissension between humans and trollkind.

13:06.619 --> 13:11.665
-I know her well. She's a real headcase.
-Hence the Eternal Night.

13:12.208 --> 13:16.295
She realized if trolls
could not survive in daylight,

13:16.378 --> 13:19.882
what if the night were everlasting?

13:19.965 --> 13:22.676
Gunmar and his forces could do
whatever they wanted.

13:22.760 --> 13:27.306
Morgana had to be stopped at any cost.
It turns out...

13:27.389 --> 13:29.475
That cost was your magic.

13:30.267 --> 13:35.022
Aye. The only way to stop her
was to expend almost all my power

13:35.105 --> 13:37.441
and confine her for as long as possible.

13:38.025 --> 13:41.237
I'm guessing "as possible"
ends right about now.

13:41.320 --> 13:46.200
We're doomed to wage battle once more
thanks to the work of Gunmar.

13:50.704 --> 13:54.083
Well, all fun things must end.

13:54.166 --> 13:57.628
If we're going to do anything about it,
we still have to get out of here.

13:57.711 --> 13:59.838
-[rumbling]
-[gasps]

14:02.633 --> 14:05.803
-What's this now?
-How's it raining underground?

14:05.886 --> 14:08.764
The cave-in must have diverted
the waterfall into the mountain.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.016
So we're not trapped,
but we're gonna drown?

14:11.100 --> 14:13.936
[Claire] That sounds like a lot of water.

14:14.019 --> 14:19.024
[sighs] Centuries later,
it never gets any easier.

14:19.108 --> 14:22.361
We could really use
some of your awesome wizard magic

14:22.444 --> 14:24.488
to, you know, get us out of here.

14:24.572 --> 14:28.284
I suppose that would be quite lovely.
But weren't you listening?

14:28.367 --> 14:33.455
I just said I used most of it
to trap Morgana. Kids these days.

14:33.539 --> 14:36.500
But you just took us
to the Killahead Battle?

14:36.584 --> 14:41.881
That was a mere parlor trick. To escape,
we'll need the power of the amulet.

14:41.964 --> 14:44.216
That might be a little difficult.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.969
I destroyed it
to get the map so we could find you.

14:47.553 --> 14:48.971
Hand it over.

14:51.348 --> 14:52.182
[Merlin] Oh.

14:52.766 --> 14:56.812
-You really did a number on this thing.
-Can you put it back together?

14:56.896 --> 15:01.233
Of course he can. Those very hands
forged the amulet in the first place--

15:01.317 --> 15:05.571
Four arms, six eyes,
but he talks as if he had ten mouths.

15:05.654 --> 15:11.869
Of course I can, my dear. These very hands
forged the amulet in the first place.

15:13.704 --> 15:14.538
[Merlin sighs]

15:15.122 --> 15:18.542
Hmm, this thingamajig went here,

15:18.626 --> 15:21.420
-and that doohickey, well...
-[rocks rumbling]

15:21.503 --> 15:25.466
-Would you please be quiet?
-It's not us. It's the rubble.

15:28.677 --> 15:30.137
[Aaarrrgghh!!!] Get out soon.

15:30.596 --> 15:33.974
Use some of the rubble to seal off
this chamber and buy us some time.

15:34.058 --> 15:35.184
Oh, yes.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.854
-[snoring]
-[Nana] You'll never be able to...

15:38.938 --> 15:40.689
-What?
-...defeat the combined might

15:40.773 --> 15:43.400
of the chewing gums!

15:43.484 --> 15:49.949
For Merlin's glory,
a sword of sunlight is mine to control!

15:50.032 --> 15:52.576
Whoosh! [grunting]

15:52.660 --> 15:56.288
Oh, I cannot defeat you
in this wretched human form!

15:56.372 --> 15:58.707
I must reveal my true self!

15:58.791 --> 16:00.751
-[chuckles]
-[rumbles]

16:00.834 --> 16:03.337
Ah! That is better! [grunts]

16:03.420 --> 16:04.546
-[thuds]
-[pot shatters]

16:04.630 --> 16:06.799
Bular told me,

16:06.882 --> 16:11.845
if I can't get you to hand over
the amulet, I should kill you!

16:11.929 --> 16:17.476
-You'd kill me in front of my son?
-I will if I have to!

16:17.559 --> 16:20.771
That's funny,
I was just thinking the same thing!

16:21.897 --> 16:23.983
[both grunting]

16:24.066 --> 16:26.068
[groans] Good one!

16:26.151 --> 16:30.114
-And now the Third Rule!
-No! Scene! Scene!

16:30.197 --> 16:32.741
Bravo! Bravo!

16:32.825 --> 16:36.328
-And scene. Great job, everybody!
-Bravo!

16:36.412 --> 16:40.666
Oh, Detective.
We've been wondering when you'd wake up.

16:40.749 --> 16:44.545
Walter, your acting
was as superb as your makeup.

16:44.628 --> 16:45.462
[groans]

16:46.505 --> 16:48.966
Sorry, but you had that coming.

16:50.884 --> 16:54.221
-Now, get out of that costume.
-[stammers] Yes, ma'am.

16:54.304 --> 16:58.517
-[sighs] What-- What? What happened?
-You passed out.

16:58.600 --> 17:02.438
[Barbara] Hmm. Yes.
A vasovagal episode, most likely.

17:02.521 --> 17:05.315
-I've got a bruise--
-[Mr. Nuñez] You fell backward.

17:05.398 --> 17:08.527
After you fell forward, he means.
[chuckles]

17:09.111 --> 17:13.156
But you seemed all right, so we decided
to proceed with our rehearsal.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.157
Rehearsal?

17:14.241 --> 17:18.412
Uh, for the play we're putting on.
Trollfighters.

17:18.494 --> 17:19.538
Hmm.

17:20.247 --> 17:24.542
You know,
I've always wanted to get into acting.

17:24.626 --> 17:28.047
I've been told I have
a very expressive face.

17:28.130 --> 17:30.090
You think there might be
a part for me?

17:30.674 --> 17:32.426
-Hmm.
-Uh...

17:33.010 --> 17:35.012
[wind howling]

17:35.095 --> 17:37.806
-[Toby] Come on!
-[Blinky] I feel we haven't much time.

17:37.890 --> 17:41.643
I'm doing my best.
It's been centuries, do you understand?

17:41.727 --> 17:43.854
Can we get an ETA on the fixing there,
Merle?

17:43.937 --> 17:45.147
Mind if I call you Merle?

17:45.230 --> 17:48.442
Not if you mind spending
the rest of your life as a cockroach.

17:48.525 --> 17:49.985
-[wind howling]
-Whoo!

17:50.069 --> 17:53.989
Well, that felt like a breath of fresh
air, huh? It was getting stuffy in here.

17:54.073 --> 17:57.201
-That wasn't a breath.
-That was a floodgate!

17:57.284 --> 17:59.787
-You have to fix it.
-What's it look like I'm doing?

17:59.870 --> 18:00.954
Twiddling my thumbs?

18:01.038 --> 18:06.001
It's an amulet forged by magic.
You don't just snap it back together.

18:06.085 --> 18:09.630
-[Merlin] A piece is missing.
-I gave you everything I had.

18:09.713 --> 18:12.216
Guys? The water is getting louder!

18:12.299 --> 18:16.470
Focus. We need a small piece,
something that can fit right here.

18:17.387 --> 18:18.680
Claire, your hair clip!

18:20.557 --> 18:22.601
Thank you, fair Claire.

18:23.393 --> 18:26.105
-[Merlin] Here.
-Now, what am I supposed to do?

18:26.188 --> 18:30.359
You're the Trollhunter, and you alone
must tap the amulet's true potential.

18:30.442 --> 18:32.236
[rocks rumbling]

18:32.319 --> 18:33.904
[water splashing]

18:36.031 --> 18:40.994
For the glory of, well, you,
Daylight is mine to command!

18:43.080 --> 18:45.916
And Daylight will protect us!

18:50.671 --> 18:52.506
[Jim grunting]

18:52.589 --> 18:57.511
You're doing it, Jimbo! I don't know
what you're doing, but you're doing it!

19:14.903 --> 19:16.071
-[laughs]
-Whoa!

19:16.155 --> 19:21.076
The instrument of our deaths has been
turned into the means of our egress!

19:21.160 --> 19:26.165
Are you a troll or a thesaurus?
I'm genuinely curious.

19:26.248 --> 19:28.375
[pants]

19:28.458 --> 19:32.629
-How did you know I could do this?
-You can do more than you realize,

19:32.713 --> 19:33.964
-and you will.
-How?

19:34.047 --> 19:37.217
When you help me destroy Morgana.

19:38.427 --> 19:40.470
-Gunbar!
-[Mr. and Mrs. Nuñez] "Gunmar"!

19:40.554 --> 19:41.388
Oh.

19:41.930 --> 19:47.186
Gunmar must be defeated at all costs!

19:47.269 --> 19:50.522
Who among you will follow me
to certain death...

19:50.606 --> 19:52.900
-Oh!
-...and glorious victory?

19:53.609 --> 19:55.569
What say you...

19:56.570 --> 20:00.282
Sir Tobias and Lady Claire?

20:01.283 --> 20:05.287
Wow. And here you said
you had no acting experience.

20:05.370 --> 20:09.166
-I don't!
-Well, you're a natural. [chuckles]

20:10.709 --> 20:11.793
Splendid!

20:11.877 --> 20:15.214
[Mr. Nuñez] That was the most
awesome thing I have ever seen!

20:17.299 --> 20:19.426
Well, that was a great rehearsal.

20:19.509 --> 20:23.722
-But I've got so many more ideas.
-Yeah, save them for our next meeting.

20:23.805 --> 20:26.099
We don't wanna exhaust
all your creativity.

20:27.809 --> 20:30.979
So you guys think it's a good idea
rehearsing twice a week?

20:31.063 --> 20:33.357
-Should've thought of that.
-Have a good night!

20:33.440 --> 20:35.400
Get some sleep,
see you this weekend! Bye!

20:38.487 --> 20:39.321
Phew.

20:39.404 --> 20:43.283
-I don't know how our kids do it.
-They'd be so proud of us.

20:43.367 --> 20:46.161
-Proud and impressed.
-[cell phone ringing]

20:46.245 --> 20:48.497
-A text from Jim.
-Oh! What's it say?

20:48.580 --> 20:51.291
-They're okay!
-I never doubted them.

20:52.417 --> 20:57.714
"We're all okay. Gunmar got the staff,
but we found Merlin?

20:57.798 --> 20:59.925
Smiley face, thumbs up."

21:00.008 --> 21:00.842
Merlin?

21:02.886 --> 21:04.096
[growls]

21:06.431 --> 21:09.810
Gunmar! You left me to die!

21:09.893 --> 21:15.023
I thought you were dead.
Congratulations on your survival.

21:15.107 --> 21:19.194
I'm not one of your henchmen!
I don't serve you!

21:19.278 --> 21:21.571
I am Angor Rot!

21:22.281 --> 21:28.078
To serve Morgana is to serve me!
I don't care who you are!

21:28.161 --> 21:33.375
I am Gunmar the Black, and you will obey!
[growls]

21:34.167 --> 21:35.168
[Angor Rot] Hmm.

21:41.633 --> 21:42.467
Huh?

21:44.803 --> 21:46.096
My queen.

21:46.179 --> 21:51.393
My fearsome servant,
you were always my champion.

21:51.476 --> 21:55.397
Stay true. Your devotion will be rewarded.

21:55.480 --> 22:00.235
Waver, and I will destroy you
once and for all.
