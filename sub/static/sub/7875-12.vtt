00:05.138 --> 00:07.368
# Good morning, U.S.A. #

00:07.474 --> 00:11.069
# I got a feeling that it's
gonna be a wonderful day #

00:11.177 --> 00:14.078
#The sun in the sky
has a smile on his face #

00:14.180 --> 00:17.809
#And he's shining a salute
to the American race #

00:20.620 --> 00:23.987
# Oh, boy
it's swell to say #

00:24.090 --> 00:26.752
<i># Good morning, U.S.A. #</i>

00:28.695 --> 00:31.926
<i>#Good morning, U.S.A. ##</i>

00:33.700 --> 00:37.397
It'll be all right, Julie.
I'm sure Craig'll turn up.

00:37.504 --> 00:39.631
He's been missing for three weeks!

00:39.739 --> 00:42.139
Oh, honey, I know.

00:42.242 --> 00:45.473
But we knew what we were in for
when we became C.I.A. Wives.

00:45.578 --> 00:49.571
<i>The secret business trips,
the late night " rendezvouses. "</i>

00:49.682 --> 00:51.843
Maybe he's deep undercover...

00:51.951 --> 00:56.047
like a kitty cat in a fluffy bed
on a cold winter night.

00:58.758 --> 01:00.919
I just feel so lost without Craig.

01:01.027 --> 01:02.756
<i>He was always there for me.</i>

01:02.862 --> 01:04.887
Whether I was laughing or crying...

01:04.998 --> 01:07.125
or having an especially
heavy period.

01:07.233 --> 01:09.599
It's just not like him to disappear.

01:09.702 --> 01:11.602
He'd tell me
if he was going somewhere.

01:11.704 --> 01:15.265
He tells me everything.
And now he could be dead!

01:15.375 --> 01:18.708
Oh, my God!
He tells you everything?

01:18.812 --> 01:21.178
He... shares with you?

01:21.281 --> 01:26.241
Yes. Every night, he gets home from work,
gives me a kiss and a hug.

01:26.352 --> 01:28.252
And then we talk about our day.

01:28.354 --> 01:30.549
He tells you about work stuff?

01:30.657 --> 01:34.457
Well, of course. I'm his wife.
We share everything.

01:34.561 --> 01:38.861
- Huh. Hi, Stan.
- Hi.

01:38.965 --> 01:40.057
- How was work?
- Fine.

01:40.166 --> 01:42.498
- Anything exciting happen?
- That's confidential.

01:42.602 --> 01:43.569
<i>- Dinner?
- Monday Night Football.</i>

01:43.670 --> 01:45.661
See you in bed.

01:48.374 --> 01:53.676
No!

02:04.891 --> 02:08.952
- Julie seems pretty sure something bad happened to Craig.
- Hmm.

02:09.062 --> 02:13.396
- Stan, Craig is your friend. How do you feel about that?
- Sucks.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.400
Damn it, Stan!
How come you never share?

02:15.502 --> 02:17.402
You never talk to me!

02:17.504 --> 02:19.904
What's there to talk about?
He's probably just on a secret mission.

02:20.006 --> 02:22.031
No. She said he would have
told her about that.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.542
He tells her everything- unlike you.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.544
I don't even know your favorite color.

02:26.646 --> 02:31.811
Francine, I'm a C.I.A. Man. Sharing,
opening up- I'm just not that type of guy.

02:31.918 --> 02:34.182
<i>Do you wanna be?</i>

02:34.287 --> 02:36.187
Whoa! Whoa! Stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop!

02:37.790 --> 02:41.590
Roger Smith, pretend psychiatrist.
Sounds like you could use my help.

02:41.694 --> 02:45.255
Roger, you can't just throw a wig on
and call yourself a doctor.

02:45.365 --> 02:49.426
I'll have you know I studied
at the feet of a master- Dr. Phil.

02:49.536 --> 02:51.436
It's Oprah approved.

02:51.538 --> 02:53.972
Oprah! Oprah! Oprah! Oprah!
Oprah! Oprah! Oprah!

02:54.073 --> 02:58.737
My card. The only currency I accept
is the joy I get from helping my patients.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.506
This is a seven of diamonds.

03:00.613 --> 03:03.446
Yeah. You're gonna have to write
my fake phone number down on that.

03:03.550 --> 03:05.541
Klondike 5-2487.

03:06.986 --> 03:09.955
Stan, I think we should give
Roger a chance to help us.

03:10.056 --> 03:11.956
What? Not in a thousand years!

03:12.058 --> 03:15.687
Fine. Then we'll just go see
Dr. Nussbaum for 150 an hour.

03:15.795 --> 03:17.695
Fine. We'll just use Roger.

03:17.797 --> 03:22.063
Operator, connect me to Klondike 5-2487.

03:22.168 --> 03:24.728
Putting you through now, sir.

03:24.837 --> 03:25.929
She's putting me through.

03:27.707 --> 03:30.175
You girls want
some sugar water, huh?

03:30.276 --> 03:33.040
Bee-trice, Bee-yoncÃ©...

03:33.146 --> 03:37.480
and the pride of the hive,
Queen Jamie Bee Curtis.

03:37.584 --> 03:40.018
Rumor has it she was born a drone.

03:40.119 --> 03:44.249
Steve, the science fair was months ago.
Get rid of those filthy insects.

03:44.357 --> 03:47.724
Don't listen to him.
He's just jealous.

03:47.827 --> 03:51.024
Oh, Your Highness is going out
for her morning constitutional.

03:53.666 --> 03:55.566
What have you done?

03:55.668 --> 03:57.568
Relax, you freak. It's just a bee.

03:57.670 --> 03:59.570
I'm glad that whore bug is dead.

03:59.672 --> 04:01.572
She wasn't a whore!

04:01.674 --> 04:04.199
She was a beautiful specimen
who captured the heart...

04:04.310 --> 04:07.609
of one lonely and sensitive
ginger-haired boy!

04:09.716 --> 04:13.880
Never cry over a whore, Steve.
Never!

04:13.987 --> 04:17.478
Mama.

04:27.600 --> 04:30.865
You like staring at those long gams,
don't you, Mr. Soprano?

04:30.970 --> 04:34.337
- That's it!
- Stan, he was just breaking the tension.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.203
Or creating some.

04:36.309 --> 04:38.334
You said you'd do this for me.

04:38.444 --> 04:41.311
Okay, if we're gonna get you to open up, Stan...

04:41.414 --> 04:43.814
we're gonna have to use
some unconventional methods.

04:43.916 --> 04:48.216
What are you thinking, Roger?
Shock therapy? Reverse psychology?

04:48.321 --> 04:50.482
Forward psychology?

04:50.590 --> 04:53.787
No. I'm gonna use something far
more effective and cutting edge.

04:53.893 --> 04:56.361
<i>Feelings!
The game of feelings!</i>

04:56.462 --> 05:01.229
<i>Now, in Feelings,
there are no winners or losers.</i>

05:01.334 --> 05:04.462
Or dice or game pieces.
What the hell, eBay?

05:06.272 --> 05:09.708
- Let go of me! This is stupid!
- You're stupid!

05:09.809 --> 05:12.369
I'm sorry.
That was unprofessional.

05:12.478 --> 05:15.038
I've been a bit consumed
with one of my other patients.

05:15.148 --> 05:19.209
He's a complicated teenage drug addict
who's being molested... by me.

05:19.319 --> 05:23.949
Francine, the problem here is that
Stan's built a wall around himself.

05:24.057 --> 05:25.957
Close your eyes, both of you.

05:26.059 --> 05:28.653
We're gonna do a communication exercise.

05:28.761 --> 05:34.324
<i>In nature, a horse will not offer you
his hoof until you gain his trust.</i>

05:34.434 --> 05:39.428
<i>And to do that, you must communicate
from your heart. Go ahead. Open your eyes.</i>

05:39.539 --> 05:42.872
Hello. I'm Clip-Clop.

05:42.975 --> 05:46.206
Let's see who can earn my hoof,
shall we? Francine?

05:47.980 --> 05:51.677
How are you, Mr. Clip-Clop?
Do you like being petted?

05:51.784 --> 05:55.379
Will you honor me with your hoof?

05:56.422 --> 05:57.912
Stan, get the camera!

05:58.024 --> 06:00.652
Okay, Francine.
Good work. Stan?

06:00.760 --> 06:02.660
Give me your foot.

06:02.762 --> 06:06.198
- It's a hoof, and you have to earn it.
- Give me your damn hoof!

06:06.299 --> 06:09.291
Neigh! Neigh!
You're spooking me!

06:09.402 --> 06:13.600
Neigh!

06:15.508 --> 06:17.976
Neigh!

06:18.077 --> 06:19.442
What the hell are you doing?

06:19.545 --> 06:22.241
I'm playing a role, sir.
What are you doing?

06:25.952 --> 06:28.944
Just a bug, huh? Filthy insects?

06:29.055 --> 06:32.786
Oh, they'll see.
They'll see the true power of the bee!

06:32.892 --> 06:35.326
You will be avenged, my sweet!

06:43.202 --> 06:46.035
# It's so hard #

06:46.139 --> 06:49.165
#To say good-bye #

06:49.275 --> 06:54.508
#To yesterday ##

07:03.656 --> 07:06.454
Francine! I think he's about to
make a breakthrough!

07:09.894 --> 07:13.022
Stan, Francine is here.

07:13.131 --> 07:16.396
- Francine?
- I'm here, Stan.

07:16.501 --> 07:18.628
Someone wants to come in, Stan.

07:18.736 --> 07:20.761
I'm- I'm scared.

07:20.872 --> 07:23.363
Tell him you want to come in,
and you have a present.

07:23.475 --> 07:26.808
I want to come in,
and I have a present.

07:26.911 --> 07:28.902
- What's the present?
- Love.

07:29.013 --> 07:31.413
It's love, Stan. It's love.

07:31.516 --> 07:36.215
And it's very heavy.
And I'd like to come in and put it down.

07:36.321 --> 07:38.380
You can come in, Francine!

07:38.490 --> 07:40.685
You don't even have to
wipe your feet!

07:45.730 --> 07:49.063
My favorite color is blue!
My lucky number is three.

07:49.167 --> 07:50.725
<i>My favorite movie is The Burbs.</i>

07:50.835 --> 07:53.235
And I'm terrified of fountains.
They're unnatural.

07:53.338 --> 07:54.828
To force a rainbow angers God!

07:54.939 --> 07:59.239
Oh, Stan! Now you're sharing just
like Craig did with Julie!

07:59.344 --> 08:02.006
This is exactly what I wanted!

08:02.113 --> 08:05.810
I'm so proud of you.

08:05.917 --> 08:08.579
- Are you really scared of fountains?
- Terrified.

08:08.686 --> 08:13.020
The last time I walked by a public fountain,
I freaked out and ripped a duck's head off.

08:13.124 --> 08:15.649
It hadn't even provoked me.

08:18.763 --> 08:21.357
I just had a dream where
Steve and I were on a boat!

08:21.466 --> 08:24.026
You'll never believe
what happened at work.

08:24.135 --> 08:27.366
The C.I.A. Was making
a promotional video with Tom Selleck!

08:27.472 --> 08:29.440
Nobody saw him,
but I heard he was around.

08:29.541 --> 08:31.099
I like seeing a woman's panty lines.

08:31.209 --> 08:33.472
Oh, and I hate frozen lemonade.

08:33.578 --> 08:36.274
Who is it that keeps demanding
colder and colder drinks?

08:36.381 --> 08:39.043
Some sort of beverage tyrant,
seems like.

08:39.150 --> 08:42.586
This is so great. I feel like
I can tell you anything, Francine...

08:42.687 --> 08:45.383
even my deepest, darkest secret.

08:45.490 --> 08:49.119
- Oh, Stan! If you think you're ready!
- Okay.

08:49.227 --> 08:53.220
I know where your friend Julie's husband is.

08:53.331 --> 08:55.663
You do? Oh! That's great!

08:55.767 --> 08:58.031
She'll be so relieved!
Where is he?

08:58.136 --> 09:00.331
- Buried in a construction site.
- What?

09:00.438 --> 09:03.066
Yeah. I killed him. He's dead.
C.I.A. Made me do it.

09:03.174 --> 09:08.806
I killed your best friend's husband.
It feels so good to share!

09:16.588 --> 09:18.681
I feel like a changed man, Francine.

09:18.790 --> 09:21.623
You've turned the spigot on,
and the secrets are just flowing out!

09:21.726 --> 09:25.162
You-You really did that
toJulie's husband?

09:25.263 --> 09:27.823
Sure did. Killed him.
Killed the crap out of him.

09:27.932 --> 09:31.766
But Craig was your friend!
How could you do this?

09:31.869 --> 09:34.099
I had to.
He told Julie everything.

09:34.205 --> 09:38.198
So the C.I.A. Designated him a blabbermouth.
That's why they made me stab him in the throat.

09:38.309 --> 09:40.539
Stop! Please, just stop talking!

09:41.579 --> 09:43.672
- With a potato peeler.
- Enough!

09:43.781 --> 09:48.650
Look. I don't want to hear any more
of your sharing! I was wrong, okay?

09:48.753 --> 09:51.244
L- I can't be around you right now.

09:51.356 --> 09:54.484
But the spigot's on!
And once it's on, it can't be turned off!

09:54.592 --> 09:56.321
Who am I gonna share with? Steve?

09:56.427 --> 09:59.624
<i>- That ginger-haired bastard's
got enough problems.</i>

10:04.435 --> 10:07.871
I didn't know what to do. So I just
told everyone I sat in smelly motor oil.

10:10.608 --> 10:13.441
Julie! You're here! With Stan!

10:13.544 --> 10:17.947
Francine, you never told me
your husband was such an open book.

10:19.951 --> 10:23.284
He reminds me of Craig.
I hope he's okay.

10:23.388 --> 10:25.982
There, there, Julie.
I'm sure he's fine.

10:26.090 --> 10:29.218
I can feel it... in here.

10:29.327 --> 10:32.160
Honey, can I talk to you?

10:33.698 --> 10:37.259
How can you buddy up toJulie
after what you did to her husband?

10:37.368 --> 10:39.199
You're the one
who wanted me to share.

10:39.303 --> 10:42.136
You said you didn't want to listen anymore.
So I found someone who does.

10:42.240 --> 10:46.677
Really? And did you tell your
new best friend your deep, dark secret?

10:46.778 --> 10:49.008
Are you kidding?
She'd go straight to the C.I. A!

10:49.113 --> 10:51.479
They'd designate me a blabbermouth,
kill me, grind me up...

10:51.582 --> 10:53.573
and mix me into
the local bologna supply!

10:53.685 --> 10:56.176
Not-Not that the C.I.A. Does that.

10:56.287 --> 10:58.847
You should keep eating bologna.
It's good for you.

10:58.956 --> 11:02.448
She was great.
You guys would have loved her.

11:02.560 --> 11:04.460
She was a queen of the people.

11:04.562 --> 11:07.963
Approachable yet regal.
And funny.

11:08.066 --> 11:11.797
Is that a beehive? You got more of them?
Why the hell would you do that?

11:11.903 --> 11:14.667
Not because you killed our queen,
and I'm building a winged army of vengeance.

11:14.772 --> 11:17.741
It's not that.
It's not that at all.

11:17.842 --> 11:19.742
It is that.

11:23.581 --> 11:25.105
Roger, I need some advice.

11:25.216 --> 11:29.152
- Sorry. I've got something in my teeth. Continue.
- I don't know what to do.

11:29.253 --> 11:32.313
I don't want Stan
sharing with me anymore because-

11:32.423 --> 11:35.620
Well, it's-
It's become a little disturbing.

11:35.727 --> 11:37.627
Oh. So tell him you're done sharing.

11:37.729 --> 11:41.256
I did. But now he's sharing
with another woman.

11:43.868 --> 11:47.929
Francine, Julie's searching for a man
to fill the role of her missing husband.

11:48.039 --> 11:50.269
And the new touchy-feely Stan fits.

11:50.374 --> 11:52.308
So what do I do?

11:52.410 --> 11:54.469
Show her Stan's not perfect.

11:54.579 --> 11:58.675
As I recall,
he's got a peculiar phobia of fountains.

11:58.783 --> 12:03.049
Yeah. MaybeJulie wouldn't find
my husband so comforting...

12:03.154 --> 12:05.145
if she saw him decapitate a duck.

12:05.256 --> 12:07.156
Thanks, Roger!

12:07.258 --> 12:10.659
Finally! Oh! Can't tell you
how long that's been in there.

12:10.762 --> 12:12.662
Looks like some sort of skin.

12:12.764 --> 12:15.426
Maybe from a red pepper?
Or a tomato.

12:15.533 --> 12:18.400
Weird. I've never eaten
a vegetable in my life.

12:20.071 --> 12:21.902
Hey, Julie.

12:22.006 --> 12:25.100
Stan wanted me to let you know that
instead of coffee at our house today...

12:25.209 --> 12:28.406
he wants to meet you
at the park instead.

12:28.513 --> 12:33.473
Yeah. By the fountains.
The public water fountains.

12:33.584 --> 12:35.518
Have fun.

12:39.223 --> 12:42.488
Oh, it was a pomegranate.
That's what was in my teeth.

12:42.593 --> 12:45.494
Look at this thing.
It looks like a woman's baby cannon.

12:52.303 --> 12:54.203
I know we're in
the middle of a show...

12:54.305 --> 12:57.672
<i>but that was American Dad's
1,000th vagina joke!</i>

12:57.775 --> 13:00.369
Oh, my God!

13:06.384 --> 13:09.182
Your brand-new Cutlass Supreme
is waiting outside.

13:09.287 --> 13:11.187
Speech! Speech!

13:11.289 --> 13:13.189
Okay, okay, okay.
Thank you.

13:13.291 --> 13:17.193
Uh, wow. Our 1,000th vagina joke.

13:17.295 --> 13:21.493
Gosh, where do I start? I guess
I'd like to thank vaginas everywhere.

13:21.599 --> 13:25.865
They're creepy and I don't know what they're for,
but, boy, are they funny! Thank you!

13:41.252 --> 13:43.379
What the hell is going on?

13:43.487 --> 13:46.251
- Francine!
- This is a public water fountain!

13:46.357 --> 13:48.257
You're supposed to be freaking out!

13:48.359 --> 13:51.692
I'm sharing all my fears with Jules,
and she's helping me conquer them!

13:51.796 --> 13:55.129
- Hey, I'll get us some frozen lemonade.
- Mmm! Sounds delish.

13:56.767 --> 14:01.204
- You're-You're drinking frozen lemonade now too?
- Eating. You eat ice.

14:01.305 --> 14:06.106
That's it, Stan! I'm sick of you
spending every waking moment with Julie!

14:06.210 --> 14:08.838
Francine, show some compassion.
Her husband is missing.

14:08.946 --> 14:11.938
<i>Because you killed him!</i>

14:12.049 --> 14:14.381
Hold that thought.
Hello? You got it.

14:14.485 --> 14:18.148
Well, Francine, you can put
your petty jealousy aside for a few days.

14:18.256 --> 14:21.384
I got to go to Laos
and take care of another blabbermouth.

14:21.492 --> 14:24.655
Wink, wink.
Think I'll use a corkscrew this time.

14:24.762 --> 14:26.753
Don't tell me
any more of your secrets!

14:30.935 --> 14:32.835
We're both on the same bike!

14:32.937 --> 14:35.997
See? See that, Marty?
That's a real tandem bike!

14:36.107 --> 14:38.302
When are you gonna make more money?

14:43.281 --> 14:47.741
Oh. Hi, Julie. I'm surprised Stan didn't
tell you he's out of town on business.

14:47.852 --> 14:51.219
Oh, he did. I'm just dropping off
some tangelos for when he gets home.

14:51.322 --> 14:54.780
His immune system gets a little weak
when he travels. He was a preemie, you know.

14:54.892 --> 14:59.124
I know that! Stan tells me about
that every time we make love!

14:59.230 --> 15:00.788
Which is forever!

15:00.898 --> 15:04.459
And besides, shouldn't you be looking
for your missing husband...

15:04.568 --> 15:07.002
instead of getting
tangelos for mine?

15:07.104 --> 15:10.130
Look. I understand you're upset
because your relationship with Stan...

15:10.241 --> 15:12.141
isn't all you want it to be, but-

15:12.243 --> 15:14.177
Well, it's not my fault
he tells me everything.

15:14.278 --> 15:16.178
Well, he doesn't tell you everything.

15:16.280 --> 15:19.010
Trust me, Francine. He-He does.

15:19.116 --> 15:20.674
Trust me. He doesn't.

15:20.785 --> 15:22.685
Oh, I'm pretty sure he does.

15:22.787 --> 15:24.948
Did he tell you he killed your husband?

15:25.056 --> 15:26.956
Oh, my God!

15:27.058 --> 15:31.427
I'm-I'm so sorry. L-The C.I.A. Made him!
I wasn't supposed to-

15:31.529 --> 15:33.622
- I'm going to the police!
- No!

15:33.731 --> 15:37.167
If this gets to the C.I.A.,
they'll kill Stan for being a blabbermouth!

15:37.268 --> 15:40.203
Then maybe you'll see
what it's like to lose your husband!

15:41.772 --> 15:45.469
I already lost Stan once,
at a flea market.

15:45.576 --> 15:48.136
I won't lose him again!

15:52.450 --> 15:55.783
Sorry I gagged you.
I was gonna gag you with a spoon.

15:55.886 --> 15:58.081
You know, sort of an '80s throwback.

15:58.189 --> 16:00.953
<i>But then I thought,
"Who's that for? Who am I doing that for?"</i>

16:01.058 --> 16:03.253
Hey, honey. How's it going?

16:03.361 --> 16:06.387
Oh, fine, fine.
Everything's fine.

16:06.497 --> 16:08.055
What was that?

16:08.165 --> 16:11.157
Nothing. Just killing a rat
with a tambourine.

16:11.268 --> 16:14.635
Well, I was just calling to check in.
Laos is amazing.

16:14.739 --> 16:16.639
Still haven't found
that blabbermouth.

16:16.741 --> 16:20.507
But when I do, I'm gonna kill him so bad
Death'll throw me an ice-cream party.

16:20.611 --> 16:23.876
Stan, maybe all blabbermouths
don't have to die.

16:23.981 --> 16:26.142
Maybe the C.I.A.
Can be reasoned with.

16:26.250 --> 16:32.052
Oh, Francine, sweet, naive Francine.
That's so stupid.

16:32.156 --> 16:35.455
Stan, there's something I have to tell you.

16:35.559 --> 16:38.858
Oh, I got to go.
A delightful monkey just took my plum!

16:42.099 --> 16:43.589
It's time.

16:48.806 --> 16:51.036
Stingers at the ready, boys!

16:51.142 --> 16:54.134
Your larvae will sing songs
about what you do here today!

16:56.280 --> 17:00.614
And you who've mocked will now
learn to respect the power of the bee!

17:00.718 --> 17:05.519
Attack, my minions!
Armed with your toxin, attack!

17:05.623 --> 17:07.522
Oh, God! You kidding me?

17:07.625 --> 17:11.959
Oh! I loved you! Oh! Where-
Ow! Ah! Oh! Not me!

17:12.063 --> 17:15.896
<i>Oh! Ow! Oh, God! Ow!</i>

17:16.000 --> 17:18.298
Aah!

17:18.402 --> 17:20.301
Your brother's weird.

17:20.404 --> 17:22.531
Julie's tied up in the basement?

17:22.640 --> 17:27.373
Roger, I had no choice. Stan's life
is in danger because I opened my mouth!

17:27.478 --> 17:29.378
So how are you gonna kill her?

17:29.480 --> 17:31.380
What? I can't kill her!

17:31.482 --> 17:33.382
Well, what are you gonna do?

17:33.484 --> 17:37.181
Well, I thought you could use
your psychological skills to-

17:37.288 --> 17:40.052
I don't know-
convince her not to say anything.

17:40.157 --> 17:44.150
Yeah. Yeah, I suppose I could.
I understand what you're looking for-

17:44.261 --> 17:47.924
A coherent, ethical, compassionate
approach to a complex problem.

17:48.032 --> 17:50.762
You should totally kill yourself.

17:56.841 --> 18:00.709
- Only good for three shots.
- Oh, Stan! Thank God you're home!

18:00.811 --> 18:03.006
- I did something terrible!
- What happened?

18:03.114 --> 18:05.446
I told Julie you killed her husband.

18:05.549 --> 18:08.211
And she threatened to go
to the police! So I knocked her out!

18:08.319 --> 18:10.685
And now she's tied up
in the basement with Roger...

18:10.788 --> 18:12.688
who's trying to
convince her to keep quiet!

18:12.790 --> 18:14.655
Roger!
Does he have a wig on?

18:14.758 --> 18:16.988
- Yes.
- Then everything's gonna be fine.

18:17.094 --> 18:19.255
- Don't scare me like that.
- What?

18:19.363 --> 18:22.890
Stan, if the C.I.A. Finds out
you blabbed to me, they'll kill you!

18:23.000 --> 18:26.163
- No one's gonna die.
- Well, Julie's dead.

18:33.878 --> 18:36.142
What are you doing?
I want to die.

18:36.247 --> 18:38.112
- Your husband's not dead.
- What?

18:38.215 --> 18:40.979
- Craig is alive?
- Yup. He's in Laos.

18:41.085 --> 18:43.849
Laos? But you said you killed him!

18:43.954 --> 18:47.219
Yeah. That was all an elaborate ruse.
Let me explain.

18:47.324 --> 18:51.260
Oh, God. I can never follow
these things. I better take notes.

18:51.362 --> 18:53.557
Okay. It all started
when me and Roger-

18:53.664 --> 18:56.155
- Who?
- Yo.

18:56.267 --> 18:59.964
<i>While you thought Roger and I
were working on my "issues"...</i>

19:00.070 --> 19:02.834
<i>we were actually figuring out a way
to get you to stop badgering me...</i>

19:02.940 --> 19:04.874
<i>about all this sharing business.</i>

19:04.975 --> 19:07.136
<i>Our plan was simple.</i>

19:07.244 --> 19:11.908
<i>I would start by telling you a bunch of
small made-up secrets, thus gaining your trust.</i>

19:12.016 --> 19:14.576
<i>That way you'd believe me
when I dropped the big bomb.</i>

19:14.685 --> 19:17.017
<i>A secret so horrific
that you'd never ask me...</i>

19:17.121 --> 19:18.884
<i>to share anything with you ever again.</i>

19:18.989 --> 19:21.048
<i>And it worked brilliantly.</i>

19:24.161 --> 19:29.121
Roger, you were in on all this, and you
were still gonna letJulie kill herself?

19:29.233 --> 19:33.033
Doctor-patient confidentiality, Francine.
Or whatever. I don't know.

19:33.137 --> 19:36.573
I don't understand. If you didn't
want to share your feelings...

19:36.674 --> 19:38.733
why did you spend
so much time with Julie?

19:38.842 --> 19:40.742
I was just doing Craig a solid.

19:40.844 --> 19:42.835
I was keeping her busy so that
he could slip into their house...

19:42.947 --> 19:44.847
<i>and get all his National Geographics.</i>

19:44.949 --> 19:48.077
<i>The-The man's been collecting
"Natty G's" since '78.</i>

19:48.185 --> 19:51.120
- But then, why did you go to Laos?
- To visit Craig.

19:51.222 --> 19:53.782
<i>He lives there now
with his new wife, Pyung.</i>

19:53.891 --> 19:56.951
<i>Cucumber farmer. Lovely woman.
Doesn't speak a lick of English.</i>

19:58.562 --> 20:01.429
Oh, I got to go. A delightful
monkey just took my plum!

20:06.370 --> 20:08.565
Hey, yea!

20:08.672 --> 20:10.867
He-He remarried?

20:10.975 --> 20:13.102
Oh, romantic story.
You ladies will love this.

20:13.210 --> 20:15.872
<i>She was actually on the cover of
one of his National Geographics...</i>

20:15.980 --> 20:17.880
when she was a little girl.

20:17.982 --> 20:20.382
Look, she signed me a copy.

20:20.484 --> 20:22.611
I can't believe he did such a thing.

20:22.720 --> 20:26.952
Well, what choice did he have? Julie was
driving him crazy with all the constant sharing.

20:27.057 --> 20:30.686
- Some men just can't share.
- Like... you.

20:30.794 --> 20:35.128
- It's just not in your nature.
- I guess I'm just not a touchy-feely guy.

20:35.232 --> 20:39.498
I know you aren't, Stan.
And I just have to accept it.

20:40.738 --> 20:42.137
- Orange.
- What?

20:42.239 --> 20:47.404
- My favorite color is orange.
- Oh, Stan. I love you too.

20:47.511 --> 20:50.912
What are we gonna do with Julie?

20:51.015 --> 20:52.915
I think I know someone who can help.

20:53.017 --> 20:56.783
And I didn't think
I was gonna get through the day.

20:56.887 --> 21:01.483
But then I remembered what you said
about letting go and moving on.

21:01.592 --> 21:03.856
You know what? I have to stop you.
This has become boring.

21:03.961 --> 21:06.122
I'm gonna be a pretend fireman
for a while.

21:12.136 --> 21:14.036
Ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding!

21:45.769 --> 21:47.669
Bye. Have a beautiful time.
