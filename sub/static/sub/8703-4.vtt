WEBVTT

00:06.656 --> 00:09.797
Papa loves you so much.

00:11.260 --> 00:13.774
Helena...

00:15.499 --> 00:19.499
I'm s... I'm sorry if I'm not the, uh...

00:19.866 --> 00:22.872
person that you wanted me to be.

00:23.238 --> 00:25.039
Hey, Pop, it's Lex.

00:25.040 --> 00:27.942
I'm not really sure when you're
gonna be able to see this,

00:27.943 --> 00:30.411
but, uh...
uh, you remember I went

00:30.412 --> 00:32.680
on vacation to visit Milo?

00:32.680 --> 00:34.282
Milo from the neighborhood,

00:34.283 --> 00:37.752
who-who helped you and Mom,
uh, get the condo?

00:37.753 --> 00:39.921
Don't let anyone stop you

00:39.922 --> 00:43.922
from being exactly who you want to be.

00:45.107 --> 00:48.042
Yeah, well, I'm gonna stay here with him

00:48.043 --> 00:49.510
for a little while,

00:49.511 --> 00:51.818
and I just wanted
to let you know where I am,

00:51.819 --> 00:53.130
so you don't have to worry.

00:53.131 --> 00:57.131
There's, uh... two life insurance policies

00:57.685 --> 01:00.821
in the bottom left-hand
drawer of the desk, so...

01:00.822 --> 01:02.656
I'm with Milo. All is well.

01:02.657 --> 01:06.657
Uh, Milo says hi, and take care.

01:14.044 --> 01:16.285
I don't know what to say.

01:17.213 --> 01:20.416
Just tell your kids
you love them, that's all.

01:23.419 --> 01:25.564
I'm not sure if they'd believe me.

01:49.621 --> 01:52.073
Uh, excuse me... is this
the American embassy?

01:52.120 --> 01:53.120
Over there.

01:53.575 --> 01:55.071
All right. Well, how do we get down there?

01:55.072 --> 01:56.134
Leave your car there.

01:56.135 --> 01:57.524
I keep eyes on it for you.

01:57.549 --> 01:59.548
All right.

02:11.698 --> 02:13.799
- Wait! Whoa!
- What?

02:13.800 --> 02:15.148
I don't think we need the luggage.

02:15.149 --> 02:16.860
I don't think I want to leave
the luggage in the car.

02:16.861 --> 02:18.413
I thought the whole point
was to get the luggage

02:18.438 --> 02:20.556
- into the damn embassy.
- Yeah, and explain

02:20.557 --> 02:21.632
- who gave us the luggage.
- You don't think four men

02:21.633 --> 02:23.240
walking into the American embassy,

02:23.265 --> 02:25.944
carrying a duffel bag,
might get misconstrued?

02:25.945 --> 02:29.246
Right. You stay here
with the luggage, Joel.

02:29.271 --> 02:31.405
- Wait, Gus, Gus!
- Keys, keys.

02:31.406 --> 02:33.207
And hey, you know, just be careful

02:33.208 --> 02:34.451
what you do and don't say.

02:34.452 --> 02:35.639
All right, all right.

02:36.999 --> 02:39.053
Your friends leave you all alone then?

02:41.194 --> 02:43.095
Yeah.

02:43.096 --> 02:44.862
It-It... It's cool.

02:53.590 --> 02:54.757
Yeah, baby!

02:54.758 --> 02:56.358
- Yes!
- Right there!

02:56.359 --> 02:58.827
Hey, do you think they'll
have a Starbucks in there?

02:58.828 --> 03:01.834
Nobody say anything until
we know were are 100% safe.

03:01.835 --> 03:03.666
Don't worry.
I ain't saying shit.

03:03.667 --> 03:06.168
No cat in the well, no drugs, okay?

03:06.169 --> 03:08.704
In fact, we don't talk unless
there's a legate present.

03:08.705 --> 03:10.707
- Huh?
- Like a Legal AttachÃ©.

04:05.280 --> 04:07.248
Come on.

04:07.249 --> 04:08.575
There's gotta be somebody here.

04:08.576 --> 04:10.056
United States government!

04:10.057 --> 04:11.719
Open the goddamn gate!

04:32.458 --> 04:35.025
Oh, shit! Oh, no! Fuck! No, no, no, no.

04:35.050 --> 04:37.220
No car wash! No wash!

04:39.566 --> 04:41.934
Thank you. Ow! Fuck!

04:41.935 --> 04:45.571
Stop it! Stop it!

04:45.572 --> 04:46.939
No wash!

04:46.940 --> 04:48.875
I think the car is really fine now.

04:48.876 --> 04:50.142
Leave that man alone!

04:50.143 --> 04:51.677
I don't have any money, nothing.

04:51.678 --> 04:53.146
I gave it all to the singer.

04:58.424 --> 05:00.344
Oh, shit.

05:00.345 --> 05:01.566
You gotta be kidding me.

05:02.137 --> 05:04.104
Maybe we can just go to another embassy.

05:04.105 --> 05:06.207
Yeah. We can pretend
to be Canadian.

05:07.541 --> 05:09.910
I don't know.

05:09.911 --> 05:12.278
Yeah, can... no, no, it's okay.

05:12.279 --> 05:13.379
How many times have I told you?

05:13.380 --> 05:14.540
You stay away from this area.

05:14.743 --> 05:16.351
Hey, hey! There was really
no need for that.

05:16.352 --> 05:17.845
Every day she makes trouble.

05:17.846 --> 05:19.012
The embassy's closed.

05:19.013 --> 05:20.241
How can the embassy be closed?

05:20.266 --> 05:21.308
Said it's closed for some funeral.

05:21.309 --> 05:22.894
- Dude, really?
- Ambassador dead.

05:22.980 --> 05:24.915
- What happened?
- Caught a tropical disease.

05:24.916 --> 05:26.182
- Goddamn it.
- Curse you...

05:26.183 --> 05:28.484
- Whoa! Hey, hey, hey!
- Curse you!

05:28.485 --> 05:29.886
I curse you and your car!

05:29.887 --> 05:31.254
- Let's go!
- Crazy shit!

05:31.255 --> 05:33.189
- Let's go!
- I'm doing it!

05:33.190 --> 05:36.626
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Go, go, go!

05:36.627 --> 05:38.394
Go, go!

05:38.395 --> 05:40.464
Get out of here!

05:41.679 --> 05:43.515
- Let go of me!
- Get out of here now!

05:48.394 --> 05:50.662
Look, we just, we go to the cops...

05:50.663 --> 05:52.264
- I don't know, man...
- Yeah. We ask to speak

05:52.265 --> 05:54.066
to the chief, the head honcho.

05:54.067 --> 05:55.200
We tell him we have information

05:55.201 --> 05:56.668
about the murder of an American citizen.

05:56.669 --> 05:58.536
We ask him to get the State
Department on the phone.

05:58.537 --> 06:00.161
Well, why don't we just call
the State Department ourselves?

06:00.162 --> 06:01.701
What are they gonna do
for us here, right now?

06:01.850 --> 06:03.116
Will they send a chopper?

06:03.117 --> 06:04.528
I don't know. The FBI, then.

06:04.529 --> 06:06.854
This is not white man's America, Lex.

06:06.855 --> 06:08.221
Maybe we should try

06:08.222 --> 06:09.458
and speak to the security
agencies back home.

06:09.483 --> 06:11.341
They will tell us that
we should go to the police

06:11.404 --> 06:12.497
and report the crime to them

06:12.498 --> 06:13.939
because they don't have jurisdiction here.

06:13.940 --> 06:16.008
Look, we go report this crime,

06:16.009 --> 06:17.352
and we get them to bring the
State Department into it for us.

06:17.353 --> 06:19.086
Guys, we have the person

06:19.087 --> 06:21.814
that killed Milo in a well, okay?

06:21.815 --> 06:23.021
This is a no-brainer.

06:23.194 --> 06:25.194
Even if we get held, we have
all the evidence we need.

06:25.195 --> 06:28.088
We have the boat location,
money, murderer... Yahtzee.

06:28.132 --> 06:29.365
- He's right.
- They're not gonna kill

06:29.366 --> 06:31.032
four Americans inside a police station.

06:31.033 --> 06:32.509
Come on. Let's just go.

06:33.738 --> 06:36.239
Just for my benefit,

06:36.240 --> 06:37.585
what's the worst that could happen?

06:37.586 --> 06:38.813
Worse case scenario...

06:38.814 --> 06:40.086
What, they keep us in there

06:40.095 --> 06:41.463
and it takes forever
and a day to un-wrangle?

06:41.464 --> 06:43.531
- I'll take that.
- Me, too.

06:43.532 --> 06:45.801
- Chicken?
- No. No, no, no.

06:48.420 --> 06:50.855
All right. Oh, wait.

06:50.856 --> 06:52.357
Should somebody stay with the luggage?

06:52.358 --> 06:54.559
We're across the street
from a police station.

06:54.560 --> 06:56.728
- I think we'll be okay.
- All right.

06:59.065 --> 07:01.033
Let's go.

07:24.346 --> 07:25.481
Hi.

07:29.274 --> 07:30.774
We'd like to speak

07:30.775 --> 07:32.876
to whoever's in charge
of this... this precinct.

07:32.877 --> 07:34.245
Why?

07:34.246 --> 07:36.063
We need to report a crime.

07:36.064 --> 07:37.868
Well, report it.

07:37.893 --> 07:39.894
It's an international crime,

07:39.895 --> 07:43.895
so we'd prefer to speak
to your chief of police,

07:43.999 --> 07:45.900
or whoever's in charge here.

07:45.901 --> 07:47.681
You don't think I can handle it?

07:47.682 --> 07:49.321
No. I mean, yes. I...

07:49.322 --> 07:51.205
What's the crime?

07:51.206 --> 07:53.140
I'm sorry.
Excuse me, sir...

07:53.141 --> 07:54.948
- I said what's the crime?
- Sir, sir, excuse me.

07:54.949 --> 07:58.914
This is a highly sensitive matter. Please.

08:09.321 --> 08:11.056
Sit, over there.

08:14.553 --> 08:16.022
Captain?

08:34.842 --> 08:36.010
Mmm!

09:18.050 --> 09:20.386
This here is Captain Moreno.

09:23.207 --> 09:25.543
You wanted to speak
to the person in charge.

09:30.849 --> 09:33.586
What can I do for you?

09:38.792 --> 09:42.792
You, uh, you-you wanted to know about a...

09:43.425 --> 09:44.667
a boat.

09:46.232 --> 09:47.503
I'm sorry?

09:51.265 --> 09:54.935
You asked us about a stolen boat.

09:57.037 --> 09:58.538
I'm not understanding.

10:00.740 --> 10:02.576
Have we met?

10:06.793 --> 10:09.629
Someone's stolen your boat?

10:12.577 --> 10:16.547
You know, I be, I be,
I believe that we, uh...

10:16.548 --> 10:17.881
we-we made a mistake.

10:17.882 --> 10:19.088
If you need to report a theft,

10:19.089 --> 10:20.830
please, my colleague will take the details.

10:20.831 --> 10:24.831
Now I'm busy, so enjoy Belize.

10:32.706 --> 10:33.972
Uh...

10:36.197 --> 10:38.111
I don't get you guys.

10:40.419 --> 10:42.050
Where are we going?

10:42.051 --> 10:43.333
- Airport.
- Oh, good call.

10:43.552 --> 10:45.053
Yeah, what if she has people
there to detain us?

10:45.054 --> 10:46.655
She's bluffing. She's a dirty cop.

10:46.656 --> 10:48.156
That's why she couldn't talk in there.

10:48.157 --> 10:51.269
Trust me. Nobody's going to stop us. Keys.

10:51.270 --> 10:53.128
Thank you.

11:09.133 --> 11:10.366
What should we do with the money?

11:10.367 --> 11:12.268
Screw the money. Leave it in the trunk.

11:12.269 --> 11:14.104
- No, no, wait a second.
- No. I'm not getting busted

11:14.105 --> 11:15.479
carrying drug money through Customs.

11:15.480 --> 11:17.540
Technically speaking, it's evidence, okay?

11:17.541 --> 11:18.784
To back up our story.

11:18.785 --> 11:20.644
Maybe... we can... leave it somewhere...

11:20.645 --> 11:21.894
Yeah, and then we can come back for it.

11:21.895 --> 11:24.144
No, I was going to say
inform the authorities.

11:24.145 --> 11:25.120
Oh, shit!

11:25.145 --> 11:27.417
- Whoa!
- What the hell...?

11:27.418 --> 11:28.495
What are you doing?

11:28.520 --> 11:30.831
I can't go to the airport.
I don't have my passport.

11:30.894 --> 11:32.061
- What?
- My passport.

11:32.062 --> 11:33.930
- I left it at the villa.
- So did I.

11:33.931 --> 11:35.197
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?

11:35.198 --> 11:36.483
Why don't you have your passport?

11:36.484 --> 11:37.983
Can we slow the fuck down, please!

11:37.984 --> 11:40.169
Who walks around with their
passport in a foreign country?

11:40.170 --> 11:41.866
- I do.
- So do I. Everybody does.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.764
No, they don't. They leave it in a safe

11:43.789 --> 11:45.541
in their hotel
or-or somewhere secure.

11:45.542 --> 11:47.530
Actually, you're supposed
to make a photocopy.

11:47.531 --> 11:49.045
You carry the copy around with you.

11:49.046 --> 11:50.179
You leave the passport in the safe.

11:50.180 --> 11:51.627
- Is that what you did?
- No.

11:51.628 --> 11:53.556
Okay. Look, I'm not
going back to the villa,

11:53.557 --> 11:55.705
so those of us with passports,
you can take to the airport...

11:55.706 --> 11:56.236
Nice, nice.

11:56.237 --> 11:57.674
And then you can go back and get yours.

11:57.675 --> 11:59.126
Good solidarity, brother.
Thank you.

11:59.268 --> 12:00.834
Okay, then you can just pull over,

12:00.835 --> 12:02.270
drop me off, and I'll take a cab.

12:02.271 --> 12:03.314
Yeah, we said we'd stick together.

12:03.315 --> 12:05.228
At Milo's grave,
we said we'd stick together.

12:05.253 --> 12:06.666
The furniture's shifted
a little since then.

12:06.706 --> 12:08.005
We are going back to the villa,

12:08.006 --> 12:09.274
we're getting the passports,

12:09.275 --> 12:10.298
and we're going to the airport together.

12:10.299 --> 12:12.244
- End of discussion!
- Yes.

12:13.472 --> 12:14.854
Do you mind not speaking to me

12:14.855 --> 12:15.813
like I'm one of your daughters?

12:15.838 --> 12:17.501
All right, stop whining like 'em.

12:43.736 --> 12:45.040
I'll just run in there, grab it,
and run out, okay?

12:45.041 --> 12:47.806
Yeah, and run fast before Miss
Crazy Cop decides to drop by.

12:47.807 --> 12:48.597
Please stay in the car.

12:48.598 --> 12:50.268
If you see someone,
just honk the horn, okay?

12:50.269 --> 12:52.112
Gus! Watch out!

12:52.620 --> 12:54.554
Oh, shit!

12:54.555 --> 12:55.823
Holy...!

13:01.200 --> 13:02.634
Oh, fuck.

13:09.302 --> 13:10.771
We all okay?

13:11.599 --> 13:12.729
Did you see that thing?

13:13.181 --> 13:15.045
I'm never riding with you again ever.

13:15.218 --> 13:16.752
What the hell was it?

13:16.753 --> 13:19.021
- A tapir.
- Huh?

13:19.022 --> 13:21.323
Joel, you all right?

13:21.324 --> 13:23.025
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- But you're bleeding.

13:23.026 --> 13:23.997
Put your head back. Put your head back.

13:24.022 --> 13:25.542
They're the national animal of Belize.

13:26.249 --> 13:27.249
Gus, are you hurt?

13:27.482 --> 13:29.381
I'm fine. It's just my neck.

13:29.461 --> 13:30.997
She cursed the car.

13:33.472 --> 13:34.770
- You okay?
- I'm good, I'm good.

13:35.276 --> 13:37.110
Now how are we gonna
get to the airport, huh?

13:37.431 --> 13:38.942
Don't worry about it.
We just hurry up and go.

13:39.206 --> 13:41.051
We get the passports and call a cab.

13:42.752 --> 13:44.353
Yeah?

13:44.510 --> 13:45.510
Okay.

13:45.679 --> 13:46.712
You?

13:46.737 --> 13:47.837
- Yeah.
- I'm all right.

13:47.862 --> 13:49.378
Oh, right, right. Hey, hey.

13:50.309 --> 13:52.111
Got everything?

13:54.315 --> 13:55.783
Got a tissue?

13:58.670 --> 14:02.670
You are literally the worst driver I know.

14:42.952 --> 14:44.453
Come on, man.

14:44.454 --> 14:47.424
I've just been in a car
accident, okay? Back off.

14:49.337 --> 14:51.480
All right, climb over.
Here... give me a boost.

14:51.677 --> 14:53.426
- No, I sprained my neck.
- Come on.

14:57.326 --> 14:59.428
Geez... hey!

14:59.453 --> 15:01.587
What the fuck?

15:02.439 --> 15:04.440
- Oh!
- Sorry.

15:07.350 --> 15:08.833
- I'm sorry.
- Did you do that on purpose?

15:08.834 --> 15:10.130
It was an accident.

15:10.131 --> 15:11.490
All right, well, come on.
Hurry up.

15:11.491 --> 15:13.923
I got a plane to catch.

15:15.738 --> 15:17.339
Go!

15:30.341 --> 15:31.876
Should we check on him?

15:32.950 --> 15:34.679
He's been down there a long time.

15:34.680 --> 15:36.013
So? Who cares?

15:36.014 --> 15:38.849
Well, us. We need him alive.

15:38.850 --> 15:41.373
We need the police to get
a confession out of him.

15:43.631 --> 15:45.641
We-We, We should at least
give him some water.

15:46.641 --> 15:48.409
He's in a well, Joel.

15:48.410 --> 15:49.610
You know what I'm saying.

15:49.611 --> 15:52.947
Fine. Go hydrate Milo's murderer.

16:06.511 --> 16:08.704
You okay?

16:10.049 --> 16:11.547
I got you some water.

16:19.351 --> 16:22.021
- You ready?
- I can't find my passport.

16:29.870 --> 16:31.003
Come on...

16:31.028 --> 16:32.464
I can't find my... passport

16:35.591 --> 16:37.027
He's gone!

16:38.830 --> 16:40.552
The fucking cat is not here!

16:40.891 --> 16:43.086
- What?
- No fucking way.

16:43.177 --> 16:45.378
Okay, I'm outta here.
I'm going to the Minimart,

16:45.450 --> 16:48.023
and I'm going to use the cash
to pay for a cab to Houston

16:48.070 --> 16:49.070
and bribe border guards.

16:49.071 --> 16:51.540
Anybody want to come with me, great.

16:51.541 --> 16:53.174
Otherwise, sayo-fucking-nara!

16:53.175 --> 16:54.577
Wait...

17:01.099 --> 17:02.403
Why'd you close the gate?

17:02.404 --> 17:04.101
I didn't close it.

17:04.102 --> 17:06.137
What the fuck is that?

17:09.373 --> 17:10.674
Oh, no.

17:13.545 --> 17:15.579
Gus, here. I'm going over.

17:15.604 --> 17:16.906
Give me a boost.

17:18.915 --> 17:22.118
Stop! Don't move.

17:22.119 --> 17:23.119
Seriously.

17:23.816 --> 17:25.384
- Don't move.
- What? What is it?

17:25.385 --> 17:26.752
- Get-Get down!
- Oh, God...

17:26.752 --> 17:29.788
Slowly. Get down. Slowly.

17:29.789 --> 17:32.691
Slowly...

17:32.692 --> 17:34.793
Geez.

17:34.794 --> 17:36.562
What?

17:37.619 --> 17:40.288
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, God. Where is it?

17:40.289 --> 17:41.689
Okay, okay...

17:41.690 --> 17:44.892
Okay... okay...

17:44.893 --> 17:46.266
Where is it?

17:46.776 --> 17:48.277
- Oh, shit.
- Okay.

17:48.302 --> 17:51.672
- Oh, shit.
- Get inside! Get inside!

17:56.172 --> 17:57.440
It's him! He's come back!

17:57.496 --> 17:58.730
What do we do? What do we do?

17:58.731 --> 18:00.332
- I don't know.
- The beach!

18:00.333 --> 18:02.334
And-and-and-and
just keep going.

18:02.335 --> 18:03.435
The beach goes into the mangrove.

18:03.436 --> 18:04.678
Yeah. Can we swim that?

18:04.679 --> 18:06.024
Can you swim faster than his boat?

18:06.049 --> 18:07.955
Okay, hunker down in, like, a panic room.

18:07.956 --> 18:10.342
Which room?

18:10.343 --> 18:12.845
- The kitchen!
- The kitchen! Go!

18:16.946 --> 18:19.381
- Shit! You okay?
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes...

18:19.758 --> 18:21.326
Shut, shut them.

18:21.572 --> 18:23.338
Barricade that door, man!

18:23.418 --> 18:24.986
Oh, shit, shit!

18:25.049 --> 18:27.017
Do you think that's gonna stop
anybody from getting in?

18:27.089 --> 18:28.655
I don't know! I'm a financial consultant!

18:28.687 --> 18:30.588
I'm not involved in a lot of sieges!

18:30.613 --> 18:31.522
What about this?
What about this?

18:31.553 --> 18:32.553
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:32.592 --> 18:34.593
- Come on.
- Two, three.

18:38.084 --> 18:39.517
- It's stuck, it's stuck.
- Oh, fuck! It's stuck!

18:39.518 --> 18:40.558
- It's stuck.
- Shit. Fuck.

18:40.559 --> 18:41.606
Can we cut this?

18:41.630 --> 18:44.165
We need a big scissors or a...

18:44.166 --> 18:45.651
- How about this?
- Yeah.

18:45.652 --> 18:47.368
- Yes!
- Yeah. Good.

18:47.369 --> 18:48.839
Just don't hold onto the wire.

18:48.840 --> 18:50.172
- Do it.
- Go ahead.

18:51.740 --> 18:54.243
Whoa! Fuck!

18:55.387 --> 18:57.026
Okay, come on, come on!

18:57.027 --> 18:57.762
Hold on, hold on.

18:57.763 --> 19:00.693
- One, two, three, go.
- One, two, three, go!

19:03.095 --> 19:04.352
- Okay, good.
- Okay, this is good.

19:04.353 --> 19:05.369
That's good.

19:05.370 --> 19:07.734
Shh. Shh.

19:51.282 --> 19:53.584
I am so, so sorry.

19:57.035 --> 19:59.003
Morons didn't even search me.

19:59.222 --> 20:01.090
Well, thank heaven for ineptitude.

20:01.765 --> 20:03.334
All four of them are in the villa.

20:03.991 --> 20:05.889
Well, two of them can't leave.

20:06.588 --> 20:08.845
And you said they're
the sort to stick together?

20:09.524 --> 20:10.764
I'm not so sure now.

20:11.249 --> 20:13.327
They seem kind of ornery.

20:14.366 --> 20:16.178
So no boats, no package.

20:16.460 --> 20:20.460
No. They have a shitload of
money, though, like millions.

20:22.199 --> 20:23.779
They seem to think it was ours.

20:26.203 --> 20:28.705
It was on the boat, presumably.

20:30.842 --> 20:32.264
Now I'm fearing the worst.

20:32.967 --> 20:34.231
You haven't heard the worst.

20:34.232 --> 20:35.908
A police captain's got one of her men

20:35.909 --> 20:37.189
on the gate at the villa.

20:37.190 --> 20:38.292
He's not gonna let them out of there

20:38.293 --> 20:39.493
until she gets what she wants.

20:39.605 --> 20:41.206
Which, I assume, is the money.

20:41.207 --> 20:42.707
You think it's hers?

20:42.708 --> 20:43.708
It's possible.

20:44.477 --> 20:46.129
Anything's possible right now.

20:48.569 --> 20:50.571
Fuckers!

21:16.317 --> 21:18.558
The embassy opens in 13 hours.

21:19.586 --> 21:21.263
So what do we do?

21:21.701 --> 21:23.402
We just sit here until then?

21:23.403 --> 21:24.570
We have to get out, right?

21:24.571 --> 21:26.497
We have to get to the money

21:26.498 --> 21:27.395
and get downtown.

21:27.396 --> 21:28.709
Without getting sniped.

21:29.842 --> 21:31.084
Oh, my God!

21:32.265 --> 21:34.734
How dumb are we?

21:37.715 --> 21:39.650
Land line. We just call out.

21:39.651 --> 21:41.051
On a cordless phone

21:41.052 --> 21:43.687
connected to the power supply that we blew.

21:43.688 --> 21:45.657
That's how dumb we are.

21:47.657 --> 21:50.559
It's pretty nice.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.861
- Milo's?
- Hmm?

21:52.862 --> 21:55.255
The watch. It's got to be
worth at least 10 grand.

21:55.256 --> 21:56.256
You plan on keeping it?

21:57.006 --> 21:58.039
I don't know.

21:58.975 --> 22:00.476
You know what?

22:01.302 --> 22:02.545
You should take it.

22:03.795 --> 22:07.245
Why? So I can always remember
what you did to him?

22:08.104 --> 22:09.248
No, thanks.

22:11.912 --> 22:14.815
It's on a pump.
No power, no pump, no water.

22:28.337 --> 22:32.337
Hey, seven mini Cokes, one small water.

22:39.423 --> 22:42.192
What? I'm dehydrated.

22:42.217 --> 22:43.750
You've got one left.

22:44.094 --> 22:45.675
I'll take one Coke, one water.

22:45.769 --> 22:46.902
What if I want the water, huh?

22:46.903 --> 22:48.432
What if he wants the water?

22:49.272 --> 22:50.440
Have the water, Lex.

22:52.026 --> 22:53.984
Oh, fuck!

22:54.009 --> 22:55.587
I'm all wet! What?

22:56.446 --> 22:57.564
Where's that coming from?

22:57.830 --> 22:58.930
What is it?

22:58.931 --> 23:00.571
Oh, it stinks!

23:00.596 --> 23:01.274
It's from the fridge.

23:01.299 --> 23:03.300
It's defrosting. It's disgusting.

23:03.301 --> 23:06.838
Oh, perfect. You're sitting
in dead Milo juice.

23:06.839 --> 23:09.841
Give me something.

23:09.842 --> 23:10.842
Give me a towel.

23:18.516 --> 23:19.551
Yeah?

23:43.386 --> 23:45.821
That opera singer was...

23:49.064 --> 23:50.444
so beautiful.

23:51.418 --> 23:55.418
I prefer the, uh, performance
artist, personally.

23:56.716 --> 23:59.106
You know, the one that broke
the, uh, windshield.

23:59.623 --> 24:01.158
You know the biggest difference

24:01.159 --> 24:02.492
between men and women?

24:02.493 --> 24:06.363
Ask any man what he regrets about his life.

24:06.364 --> 24:09.733
He'll tell you it's
the things he didn't do.

24:10.521 --> 24:12.380
You ask any woman the same question.

24:12.435 --> 24:15.838
They'll always say they regret
something they did do.

24:17.252 --> 24:18.401
If this is it,

24:19.094 --> 24:23.094
if it all ends, like, right now...

24:26.233 --> 24:27.451
how would you feel?

24:28.834 --> 24:30.825
A little peeved.

24:31.693 --> 24:33.028
What are you talking about, man?

24:33.053 --> 24:34.053
I have kids.

24:34.513 --> 24:35.802
So do I.

24:37.637 --> 24:39.402
You know what I keep thinking about?

24:41.988 --> 24:45.152
What people might find out
about me if I don't come back.

24:46.160 --> 24:48.801
And things might be misinterpreted.

24:49.336 --> 24:51.268
Receipts or e-mails.

24:51.987 --> 24:55.289
Nothing bad, but, just...
I didn't have the chance

24:55.290 --> 24:57.358
to explain it properly.

24:57.359 --> 24:59.123
I'm supposed to be moving my pops

24:59.148 --> 25:01.054
into this Alzheimer's unit next week.

25:02.328 --> 25:04.062
Sorry to hear that, man.

25:04.063 --> 25:06.482
Alzheimer's. That sucks.

25:06.858 --> 25:08.726
It's genetic too, right?

25:08.727 --> 25:11.729
You're a fucking asshole.

25:11.730 --> 25:15.730
I'm sorry. I'm not too familiar
with the research, actually.

25:16.674 --> 25:19.025
But I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that.

25:20.544 --> 25:22.525
Say you could have your life over again.

25:23.475 --> 25:25.297
Would you do it all the same?

25:25.298 --> 25:26.806
No. Definitely not.

25:26.807 --> 25:28.948
So it's true. We all regret

25:28.949 --> 25:30.768
the things we didn't do
when we had the chance,

25:30.769 --> 25:34.769
and we don't get to go back
and change any of it.

25:35.995 --> 25:37.264
It's fucked up.

25:37.335 --> 25:39.503
- What's fucked up?
- Life.

25:39.504 --> 25:41.514
There's a design flaw.

25:42.340 --> 25:44.006
Please, Lord...

25:45.611 --> 25:46.977
I screwed up my life.

25:46.978 --> 25:48.599
May I please have another shot?

25:50.420 --> 25:52.021
No!

25:53.057 --> 25:55.992
No, you, uh, you had your chance.

25:55.993 --> 25:57.580
Now fuck off.

25:58.815 --> 26:00.760
Still...

26:01.851 --> 26:04.854
at least we've seen a tapir.

26:10.226 --> 26:11.860
Captain?

26:11.861 --> 26:15.861
We haven't met, but I know your boss.

26:18.829 --> 26:19.996
My boss?

26:19.997 --> 26:22.332
The assistant commissioner at Belmopan.

26:22.333 --> 26:23.901
We go way back.

26:25.116 --> 26:27.117
You want to keep things swift.
I understand.

26:27.118 --> 26:28.251
Walls have ears.

26:28.252 --> 26:30.186
Careless talk costs lives.

26:30.187 --> 26:32.689
- What do you want?
- The boat.

26:32.690 --> 26:34.690
I think we both know how these things work.

26:34.839 --> 26:36.240
You give me the boat,

26:36.241 --> 26:38.042
and in return, I'll get
your money back for you

26:38.043 --> 26:42.043
and at the same time, take
care of the four Americans.

26:42.247 --> 26:44.114
You don't have to get your hands dirty.

26:44.115 --> 26:47.102
All I'm really interested in is a package.

26:48.102 --> 26:49.102
It's on the boat.

26:49.571 --> 26:50.476
Get that back for me,

26:50.477 --> 26:52.852
and I'll pay whatever expenses
are deemed appropriate.

26:54.579 --> 26:58.386
Interesting that you think
I can be enticed by money.

26:58.761 --> 27:00.395
No offense, but I can only imagine

27:00.396 --> 27:01.714
how poorly your boss pays you.

27:02.878 --> 27:05.467
Then you have no idea who my boss is.

27:05.468 --> 27:08.719
If you did, I don't think
you'd show your face.

27:09.405 --> 27:11.706
However, I will tell JesÃºs

27:11.707 --> 27:13.875
you were trying to get
your hands on his boat.

27:13.876 --> 27:15.347
He'll be curious.

27:16.480 --> 27:20.480
He has a... a thing about hands.

28:42.725 --> 28:44.192
What was that?

28:56.498 --> 28:57.966
Nothing.

29:17.302 --> 29:19.938
She called me.

29:23.294 --> 29:24.661
Helena.

29:26.138 --> 29:28.146
I never got in touch with her.

29:31.263 --> 29:33.192
The first time was about a year ago.

29:35.326 --> 29:36.528
The first time?

29:38.200 --> 29:40.230
Wait. How many times did she call you?

29:40.231 --> 29:42.574
A few, more after
we started seeing each other.

29:42.984 --> 29:44.410
- Wait...
- Not like that.

29:45.739 --> 29:49.202
We just met for coffee and then lunches.

29:50.047 --> 29:51.513
Wow.

29:51.514 --> 29:54.216
- I didn't sleep with her.
- Well, I hope not, Joel.

29:54.217 --> 29:56.552
Because that's fucking disgusting.

29:56.553 --> 29:59.521
That is the worst thing
that you can do, okay?

29:59.522 --> 30:01.290
There's a code between friends.

30:01.291 --> 30:02.377
Listen to me... She's my friend.

30:02.378 --> 30:03.690
I've known her a long time.

30:04.094 --> 30:05.237
Longer than you have, even.

30:05.895 --> 30:09.398
Yeah. She wanted advice...

30:09.399 --> 30:10.553
She wanted to sit down and talk.

30:10.578 --> 30:11.201
Sit down and talk?

30:11.311 --> 30:13.046
What, do you think I'm stupid, Joel?

30:13.047 --> 30:16.049
Guys don't sit down and talk.

30:16.050 --> 30:17.616
We may call, if we have to,

30:17.617 --> 30:20.353
we may send an e-mail or-or a text,

30:20.354 --> 30:22.288
but most guys avoid all forms

30:22.289 --> 30:24.923
of extended discussion at all costs.

30:24.924 --> 30:26.525
There is one exception, though.

30:26.526 --> 30:28.442
If we think there's gonna be
a fuck at the end of it,

30:28.443 --> 30:30.329
then we're all ears.

30:30.330 --> 30:31.793
We'll listen to anything,
as long as it takes.

30:32.004 --> 30:33.449
Sit down and talk?!

30:34.552 --> 30:36.371
Don't insult me, Joel!

30:36.372 --> 30:38.589
Oh, fuck.

30:39.918 --> 30:42.452
What the fuck?

30:57.309 --> 30:58.309
It's a goat.

30:58.750 --> 30:59.917
Huh?

31:01.840 --> 31:03.003
A baby goat.

31:03.575 --> 31:06.988
Goat sightings haven't exactly
boded well for us lately.

31:08.880 --> 31:10.216
Just saying.

31:53.668 --> 31:56.403
You have one new message. Message from...

31:56.404 --> 31:57.804
JesÃºs.

31:57.805 --> 32:00.493
The matter at hand must be concluded.

32:00.494 --> 32:04.385
Don't make me wait any longer. Good-bye.

32:04.771 --> 32:07.405
Captain, about that missing boat.

32:07.430 --> 32:09.031
There's all the cays
in the section of the coast

32:09.056 --> 32:10.288
to search in the first district.

32:10.343 --> 32:11.503
You still want to come along?

32:11.655 --> 32:12.655
Yes.

32:49.783 --> 32:51.673
You know, this guy...

32:53.134 --> 32:55.001
had the best idea yesterday,

32:55.002 --> 32:57.423
when he was trying to make that
deal with the cop at the gate.

32:57.424 --> 33:00.260
I wasn't trying to make
a deal with the cop.

33:00.261 --> 33:02.262
I didn't even know what the fuck
she was talking about.

33:02.263 --> 33:04.464
Swear to me she wasn't
offering you a way out.

33:04.465 --> 33:06.366
No, sure, she was offering me a way out...

33:06.367 --> 33:08.068
Hey, stop denying it.

33:08.069 --> 33:09.569
It's not so much you're thinking of it.

33:09.570 --> 33:10.797
It's the fact that you keep lying to us.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.805
I'm not lying.
She kept saying...

33:12.806 --> 33:13.839
Your whole life is a lie.

33:13.840 --> 33:15.075
Milo slam-dunked you.

33:15.076 --> 33:16.709
Your business is in the shitter.

33:16.710 --> 33:18.578
You don't know a damn thing
about my business... come on!

33:18.579 --> 33:20.973
You didn't give up law! You got disbarred!

33:20.998 --> 33:23.470
Our buddy Cobi checked it all out.

33:24.987 --> 33:26.688
What do you mean, Cobi checked it all out?

33:26.689 --> 33:29.791
I know. The power of Google. It's shocking.

33:29.792 --> 33:31.894
Tell us it's not true, Gus.

33:40.002 --> 33:41.371
Well, fuck this.

33:44.965 --> 33:46.264
I didn't get disbarred.

33:46.265 --> 33:49.101
The firm got sued for-for malpractice.

33:49.102 --> 33:53.102
Some toxic, judicial fucker-be
designed to profit

33:53.327 --> 33:56.796
somebody, somewhere, somehow,
that was
