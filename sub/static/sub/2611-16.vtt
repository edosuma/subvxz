WEBVTT

00:29.220 --> 00:30.763
You're not going to
disappoint me, are you, Ace?

01:14.724 --> 01:16.017
No ID on him?

01:16.017 --> 01:19.145
Jeans, t-shirt,
K-Mart socks.

01:19.145 --> 01:20.313
Big spender.

01:20.313 --> 01:22.398
He saved his pennies
for the peeps.

01:27.236 --> 01:28.362
Speed.

01:29.614 --> 01:31.449
How old do you
think the girl is?

01:31.449 --> 01:35.244
I don't know.
I never saw him before this.

01:35.244 --> 01:37.205
Eighteen, maybe nineteen.

01:39.290 --> 01:40.625
Just a kid.

01:42.001 --> 01:45.213
So the weapon had to be long
enough to penetrate this backdoor...

01:45.213 --> 01:46.255
to do damage, right?

01:49.175 --> 01:51.010
Yeah. The guy
inside the booth...

01:51.511 --> 01:53.429
must have been pressing
against the wall.

01:53.429 --> 01:56.349
Poised to see paradise.

02:31.801 --> 02:34.929
1x16 Evidence of Things Unseen

02:45.438 --> 02:47.106
Sharp force injuries.

02:47.523 --> 02:49.734
Three knife strikes
through the door.

02:49.734 --> 02:51.194
Only two in the body.

02:51.194 --> 02:52.862
That's all he
needed I guess.

02:53.905 --> 02:55.782
So, what about an ID, Alexx?

02:56.407 --> 02:58.076
Nothing out of the ordinary.

02:58.785 --> 02:59.786
So far.

03:01.871 --> 03:03.915
Oof. Bad teeth.

03:03.915 --> 03:06.084
He looks Eastern
European to me.

03:06.709 --> 03:08.878
We'll post him in a
couple of hours.

03:08.878 --> 03:09.921
Okay.

03:12.840 --> 03:16.344
You ever seen that video
"Sexy Guns, Sexy Girls"?

03:16.344 --> 03:18.930
If you go into a booth
with that saw,

03:18.930 --> 03:20.515
you don't even have
to take your clothes off.

03:20.515 --> 03:22.934
You'd make a fortune in tips.

03:23.476 --> 03:25.436
You're standing
in my crime scene.

03:26.271 --> 03:28.731
If you take the door,
I got to close the booth.

03:29.774 --> 03:31.317
Then close the booth.

03:32.360 --> 03:34.362
Can't blame a guy for
trying to make a living.

03:34.362 --> 03:36.656
I hear you.
So what do we have?

03:36.656 --> 03:38.950
Serrated blade,
eight inches.

03:38.950 --> 03:41.578
With the strike wider at
the top than the bottom.

03:41.578 --> 03:43.871
Some sort of hunting knife.
Well, he was hunting.

03:43.871 --> 03:47.000
The question becomes how
did he know where to aim?

03:49.419 --> 03:51.296
Wait a second.
What is this?

04:05.643 --> 04:07.186
That looks recent,
doesn't it?

04:07.895 --> 04:09.564
I'm taking the door with me.

04:14.444 --> 04:16.529
Lot of people have
been in this booth.

04:17.988 --> 04:19.574
Everybody but a janitor.

04:23.453 --> 04:24.913
Hey, check this out.

04:30.543 --> 04:31.461
It's a hair.

04:32.211 --> 04:34.088
Could be from a million guys.

04:36.799 --> 04:38.426
Yeah, but look how thick it is.

04:39.260 --> 04:41.971
And it's needle-pointed.
I don't think that's human.

04:43.014 --> 04:44.349
Here's another one.

04:44.349 --> 04:46.309
Must have found at
least twenty of them.

04:46.309 --> 04:48.811
Bet when you process
his clothes, you'll find more.

04:48.811 --> 04:50.897
Who's this guy been
hanging out with?

04:51.940 --> 04:53.691
Give me a hand,
Horatio, please.

04:56.819 --> 04:58.488
T-shaped injuries.

04:58.905 --> 05:02.033
Which means the killer
used a single-edged blade.

05:05.370 --> 05:06.955
Any marks on the ribs?

05:06.955 --> 05:07.997
Not the first one.

05:07.997 --> 05:10.124
Slipped right between the ribs.

05:10.124 --> 05:12.043
Punctured his left lung.

05:12.043 --> 05:13.753
Filling the lungs with blood.

05:13.753 --> 05:16.673
Which he then spewed
all over the plexiglas.

05:19.550 --> 05:21.719
Second stab chipped
the fifth vertebrae...

05:21.719 --> 05:23.054
and severed his spinal cord.

05:23.304 --> 05:24.973
There's your cause of death.

05:25.598 --> 05:27.684
Lights out, my friend.

05:35.149 --> 05:37.902
Plywood, two layers.
Blade didn't fragment.

05:38.319 --> 05:39.904
Cheap door,
good knife.

05:40.321 --> 05:41.906
I think I've narrowed it
down to three.

05:42.824 --> 05:44.617
Gryphon m35 ...

05:45.660 --> 05:46.786
recon ...

05:46.786 --> 05:49.038
With a tanto point.

05:49.038 --> 05:51.874
And Echelon MPT.

05:51.874 --> 05:52.959
Thank you.

05:53.501 --> 05:54.586
So ...

05:55.295 --> 05:56.671
is he military?

05:58.214 --> 05:59.924
Is he SWAT?

05:59.924 --> 06:01.634
Well, in any case,
it's weapons grade,

06:01.634 --> 06:04.178
and whoever owns it,
didn't get it to play mumblety-peg.

06:04.178 --> 06:05.763
Or "I spy."

06:07.223 --> 06:09.392
Okay, so ...

06:10.393 --> 06:12.437
I'm about six feet tall and...

06:12.437 --> 06:14.939
that would make the killer
roughly the same height.

06:14.939 --> 06:18.026
He would probably place his
left hand up here for support.

06:18.026 --> 06:19.569
Making him right-handed.

06:19.569 --> 06:21.195
And then lean in ...

06:21.905 --> 06:23.698
to hide what he was doing.

06:35.335 --> 06:36.377
Now,

06:37.253 --> 06:39.756
people don't make a lot of eye
contact in a place like this, right?

06:39.756 --> 06:41.841
So even if he was detected,

06:41.841 --> 06:43.635
somebody might just
think he was wasted.

06:43.635 --> 06:46.012
Well, he definitely knew
his way around the place.

06:46.012 --> 06:49.474
There's a reason the
Italians call it "little death."

06:56.314 --> 06:57.857
So he came and went.

06:58.900 --> 06:59.817
Came and went.

06:59.817 --> 07:01.903
This a good place
to kill somebody, isn't it?

07:09.744 --> 07:10.912
I'm not working.

07:11.329 --> 07:12.288
I am.

07:15.208 --> 07:16.542
One of the cops.

07:16.834 --> 07:18.419
CSI.

07:19.462 --> 07:20.797
Well, you came
to the right place.

07:21.839 --> 07:23.091
My whole life's
a crime scene.

07:23.091 --> 07:24.467
When are you going to arrest
whoever's responsible...

07:24.467 --> 07:27.637
for me having this crappy
job in this crappy town?

07:28.263 --> 07:32.183
Do you, um, work the same shift,
the same booth every night?

07:32.684 --> 07:33.726
When I can get it.

07:34.560 --> 07:35.937
It's in the back,
out of the way.

07:36.354 --> 07:38.940
Make more money when
you give the guys a little extra.

07:38.940 --> 07:40.483
Well, the guy they
took out of here...

07:40.483 --> 07:41.901
in a body bag got extra,
didn't he?

07:43.570 --> 07:46.614
Forgive me if I'm
not more surprised, but ...

07:47.156 --> 07:50.785
Did you happen to notice what
part of town we're in, Slugger?

07:51.828 --> 07:53.538
Oh, and by the way,

07:53.538 --> 07:55.623
that guy that got killed
I never saw him before.

07:57.292 --> 07:59.085
That's what you
were going to ask, right?

07:59.085 --> 08:02.088
Actually, I was going to ask
you if you work off the clock.

08:03.131 --> 08:04.716
Is that an offer?

08:05.049 --> 08:06.509
I'll take that as a yes.

08:06.509 --> 08:07.969
Where you from?

08:07.969 --> 08:09.429
Lake Leelanau.

08:09.429 --> 08:11.014
Michigan.

08:14.142 --> 08:15.184
Okay.

08:16.394 --> 08:19.105
Only people from
home know that and ...

08:20.231 --> 08:22.275
I don't make you
for a wolverine.

08:22.275 --> 08:25.069
Well, I spend a lot
of time looking at maps.

08:27.155 --> 08:29.115
You're a lot more fun
than you look, you know?

08:30.658 --> 08:33.870
All right, CSI, what do
you want me to say?

08:34.787 --> 08:35.914
How about ...

08:37.373 --> 08:38.750
I won't go back.

08:44.212 --> 08:46.132
I won't go back.

08:48.927 --> 08:50.553
Then again,

08:50.553 --> 08:52.972
you're paid to tell men
what they want to hear, right?

08:56.392 --> 08:57.435
That's right.

09:11.616 --> 09:13.326
We know it's not human.

09:13.326 --> 09:15.370
Hey, did you see
that tall one?

09:15.370 --> 09:16.454
At the peeps?

09:16.454 --> 09:18.665
The medulla's fragmented.

09:18.665 --> 09:21.167
The index is less
than one-third.

09:21.167 --> 09:24.003
So, we're talking about
a higher primate.

09:25.380 --> 09:26.923
Hey, did you
ever date a stripper?

09:27.882 --> 09:30.301
Nah, I wouldn't
call it dating.

09:30.301 --> 09:32.345
Gentlemen,
what did we get?

09:32.345 --> 09:33.638
Hairs from the victim.

09:33.638 --> 09:36.182
Cortex to medulla ratio
tells us it's from an ape.

09:36.182 --> 09:38.309
Uh, maybe a chimp,
maybe a gorilla.

09:38.309 --> 09:41.020
Let's assume then that the victim
brought the hair to the party.

09:41.020 --> 09:42.230
From where he works or lives.

09:42.230 --> 09:45.608
Right, so let's check into zoos,
animal shows, circuses,

09:45.608 --> 09:48.069
anywhere where
an Eastern European...

09:48.069 --> 09:49.946
with bad teeth could
have access to an ape.

09:49.946 --> 09:50.989
All right?

10:08.131 --> 10:09.799
You work with Chimps?

10:10.633 --> 10:12.719
I work all over the zoo.

10:13.261 --> 10:14.137
With your cousin?

10:14.137 --> 10:16.097
With that son-of-a-bitch.

10:16.097 --> 10:18.308
God rest his soul.

10:20.935 --> 10:22.437
Where'd you get those?

10:22.437 --> 10:24.522
Where'd you learn
to speak Russian?

10:27.901 --> 10:30.028
That's Victor Ratsch.
Night custodian.

10:30.028 --> 10:32.030
His, uh, cousin
got him the job.

10:32.030 --> 10:33.656
They couldn't stop
fighting. I mean,

10:33.656 --> 10:35.742
I recommended they fire one
of them, but you know ...

10:35.742 --> 10:37.577
who listens to the pr flak?

10:37.577 --> 10:38.953
You know what
they fought about?

10:38.953 --> 10:39.704
I don't know.

10:39.704 --> 10:42.498
I don't speak Russian and
Vadim doesn't speak English.

10:42.498 --> 10:43.708
Did Ratsch speak English?

10:43.708 --> 10:45.209
Yeah, he was motivated.

10:45.209 --> 10:46.294
American women.

10:47.128 --> 10:49.380
Why do you think he went
to peep shows then?

10:49.380 --> 10:51.090
I didn't say he had any
luck with them.

10:52.133 --> 10:53.760
Okay, thank you.
Excuse me.

10:53.760 --> 10:55.219
Yeah, Horatio.

11:10.026 --> 11:11.069
Hit-and-run.

11:15.698 --> 11:17.242
She kept her word.

11:18.284 --> 11:19.327
What's that?

11:21.829 --> 11:23.164
She's not going back.

11:39.804 --> 11:41.055
Both legs are broken.

11:45.143 --> 11:46.936
Massive head trauma.

11:47.979 --> 11:50.065
And unless she
was a diabetic ...

11:53.401 --> 11:54.569
Track marks.

11:55.820 --> 11:57.363
All the way from Michigan.

11:57.655 --> 12:00.700
Like most vehicles versus peds,
she was flipped by the car.

12:00.700 --> 12:02.368
Impact with the
pavement killed her.

12:07.123 --> 12:08.666
Okay, but if she was
flipped by the vehicle,

12:08.666 --> 12:10.877
there would be evidence all
over the vehicle, wouldn't there?

12:14.339 --> 12:15.799
Imprint on her calf.

12:18.927 --> 12:20.386
Could be electropark.

12:20.386 --> 12:22.347
Parking by Braille.
Beep, beep.

12:22.347 --> 12:25.767
Right. So we're looking for a
late model, high-end vehicle.

12:27.102 --> 12:29.187
Is that a shard of glass, Alexx?

12:38.571 --> 12:40.365
Can't be safety glass.

12:40.657 --> 12:42.075
Could be from the headlight.

12:42.075 --> 12:43.493
I'll take that.

12:46.538 --> 12:47.705
You get anything, Eric?

12:49.791 --> 12:51.918
No skid marks.
Nothing.

12:52.419 --> 12:55.004
Side of the road,
she's all in black.

12:55.422 --> 12:57.340
Seventy percent
of all drivers...

12:57.340 --> 12:59.926
on the road after 2:00 A.M.
are over the legal limit.

13:00.552 --> 13:01.928
Could be just an accident.

13:01.928 --> 13:03.304
Guess that's possible.

13:03.847 --> 13:06.182
Well, we find the car,
we'll ask the owner.

13:06.933 --> 13:08.017
You do that.

13:08.017 --> 13:09.978
I'm going to find out who
she danced for last night.

13:09.978 --> 13:11.354
Thank you, Alexx.

13:15.108 --> 13:16.651
It's not like we
take roll call here.

13:16.651 --> 13:18.528
Guys come here
to be invisible.

13:19.028 --> 13:22.365
If I looked, if I asked questions,
I'd be out of business.

13:22.782 --> 13:24.951
Key to any business
is return customers.

13:24.951 --> 13:25.994
What about them?

13:26.703 --> 13:28.329
I notice them even less.

13:29.247 --> 13:30.749
So nobody stands out?

13:31.249 --> 13:33.126
You might want to
check out her husband.

13:33.543 --> 13:34.961
He's a real prize.

13:35.795 --> 13:38.131
How do you spell, uh, pimp?

13:38.131 --> 13:40.008
Rick Breck.

13:41.551 --> 13:42.594
Thank you.

13:48.600 --> 13:50.018
Casa del Breck.

13:50.727 --> 13:52.312
Married less than a year.

13:52.312 --> 13:53.438
All righty.

13:53.855 --> 13:54.981
Still on the honeymoon.

13:56.024 --> 13:57.609
You and Amy have a car?

13:57.609 --> 13:59.110
We've been looking.

13:59.527 --> 14:01.196
She likes to walk home.

14:01.821 --> 14:04.115
Liked the fresh air.

14:04.741 --> 14:06.284
When she didn't show
you weren't worried?

14:06.618 --> 14:08.203
She comes, she goes ...

14:08.703 --> 14:10.497
she always calls.

14:10.497 --> 14:12.207
How about last night?

14:13.249 --> 14:14.292
She call you?

14:15.001 --> 14:17.295
Yeah, but I wasn't here.

14:17.295 --> 14:18.838
She left a message.

14:18.838 --> 14:20.006
Can I hear it?

14:20.006 --> 14:21.424
I erased it.

14:22.133 --> 14:23.593
Remember what she said?

14:24.094 --> 14:25.220
The usual.

14:28.264 --> 14:30.725
Then you won't mind if I take
the answering machine with me.

14:31.768 --> 14:33.853
There's nothing on it.
Sure.

14:35.105 --> 14:36.147
Okay.

14:37.857 --> 14:39.192
I have one more
question for you.

14:39.818 --> 14:42.821
Do you have a life insurance
policy out on your wife?

14:43.238 --> 14:44.614
Are you kidding?

14:44.614 --> 14:47.242
I don't even have
health insurance.

14:49.119 --> 14:50.328
We should get a warrant.

14:50.328 --> 14:51.579
On what grounds?

14:51.579 --> 14:53.498
On grounds that this
is a murder investigation.

14:53.498 --> 14:54.666
It's a hit-and-run.

14:54.666 --> 14:56.626
He is obviously lying.

14:56.626 --> 14:58.336
His lips were moving,
of course he's lying.

14:58.336 --> 15:00.380
You see, I think if we can
connect these two cases...

15:00.380 --> 15:02.298
we have a shot
at probable cause.

15:02.298 --> 15:04.551
The probable cause
is she's a stripper,

15:04.551 --> 15:06.302
she's a junkie and
she's a whore.

15:06.302 --> 15:07.512
She's also a human being ...

15:07.512 --> 15:08.721
And now she's a corpse.

15:08.721 --> 15:12.058
And by god, don't you ever step
on my investigation again.

15:15.520 --> 15:18.982
Glass shard was from a
Mercedes Benz, S Series.

15:18.982 --> 15:21.484
From this millennium,
but as far as that goes,

15:21.484 --> 15:22.652
it's a dead end.

15:22.652 --> 15:24.904
Okay.
What else you got?

15:25.238 --> 15:28.116
Well, I'm working on this tape
from the answering machine.

15:28.533 --> 15:31.202
I know one thing the
husband wasn't lying about:

15:31.202 --> 15:33.288
Amy's message was erased.

15:33.288 --> 15:35.874
I recovered it using
high-tech microscopy.

15:35.874 --> 15:37.792
Bottom line,
tape has memory.

15:37.792 --> 15:40.211
Certainly more than Mr. Breck.
Let's hear it.

15:41.254 --> 15:42.881
Hey, Rick,
I'm on my way.

15:43.423 --> 15:45.383
Did you get the stuff you
promised you'd pick up?

15:45.383 --> 15:46.760
See, here's where
we lose Amy,

15:46.760 --> 15:49.012
but if you scrub out
the music ...

15:50.054 --> 15:52.432
Hey, Rick,
I'm on my way.

15:52.432 --> 15:54.517
Did you get the stuff you
promised you'd pick up?

15:54.934 --> 15:56.686
Judging by the condition
of her arm,

15:56.686 --> 15:58.813
she's definitely talking
about drugs.

15:59.230 --> 16:01.566
And they say husbands don't
do anything around the house.

16:01.566 --> 16:03.109
Okay, here we go.

16:04.152 --> 16:07.363
After tonight,
I could really use some.

16:08.406 --> 16:09.449
Ace, hi.

16:14.162 --> 16:15.622
Don't start without me, okay?

16:16.664 --> 16:17.999
Okay, now,
hold on a second.

16:17.999 --> 16:19.584
Let's play it again.

16:19.584 --> 16:21.669
Let's lift the background
and the siren.

16:25.965 --> 16:27.509
Hey, Rick,
I'm on my way.

16:28.468 --> 16:30.470
Did you get the stuff
you promised you'd pick up?

16:30.887 --> 16:32.972
After tonight,
I could really use some.

16:37.435 --> 16:38.269
Hey.

16:38.812 --> 16:39.979
Do we know "hey"?

16:39.979 --> 16:41.106
Keep going.

16:41.523 --> 16:42.607
Ace, hi.

16:43.024 --> 16:44.484
We got a deal.

16:45.819 --> 16:47.195
Don't start without me, okay?

16:48.154 --> 16:49.739
What kind of deal?

16:49.739 --> 16:51.491
Let's go talk to Houseboat Rick,

16:51.491 --> 16:54.702
find out who Ace is and what
kind of a deal Amy had going.

16:54.702 --> 16:56.579
Okay, but what makes
you think he's going...

16:56.579 --> 16:58.164
to be more cooperative this time?

16:58.164 --> 17:00.834
An old drug charge I just
dug up on him won't hurt.

17:00.834 --> 17:01.876
Let's go.

17:09.759 --> 17:11.219
Another accident?

17:17.392 --> 17:18.560
Let's call it in.

17:32.322 --> 17:33.281
Fresh kill.

17:33.281 --> 17:34.616
Barely waterlogged.

17:34.616 --> 17:37.077
Any scratches or
defensive wounds, Alexx?

17:37.077 --> 17:38.828
Not cursorily, no.

17:39.329 --> 17:41.706
Foam around the
mouth and nostrils.

17:41.706 --> 17:43.333
Earmarks of a drowning.

17:43.333 --> 17:45.418
I'd like to see
what's in his lungs.

17:45.710 --> 17:46.753
I'll find you.

17:46.753 --> 17:47.504
Okay.

17:47.504 --> 17:51.216
The husband's dead,
the wife is dead ...

17:52.259 --> 17:53.426
Russian's dead.

17:53.426 --> 17:55.637
Yes, let's go talk to the
other Russian, the cousin,

17:55.637 --> 17:57.514
before he chokes
on a twizzler.

17:58.556 --> 17:59.683
Thank you, Alexx.

18:01.476 --> 18:04.938
Tell him that I can see by
the scratches on his face...

18:04.938 --> 18:07.023
that he's been in
a recent altercation.

18:12.529 --> 18:13.905
A lion, a tiger ...

18:13.905 --> 18:15.407
he says he doesn't remember.

18:15.407 --> 18:16.449
Okay.

18:16.783 --> 18:19.578
Now tell him that if I check
under his fingernails,

18:19.578 --> 18:21.288
and I can match it
to his dead cousin,

18:21.288 --> 18:23.373
I'm going to arrest
him for murder.

18:32.507 --> 18:34.759
He says he doesn't
have to talk to you.

18:34.759 --> 18:35.552
All right.

18:35.552 --> 18:36.511
Vadim,

18:36.511 --> 18:39.848
Mr. Infante at the zoo says you
don't speak English, is that true?

18:44.519 --> 18:48.273
Vadim, you've been in
the country for a long time,

18:48.273 --> 18:51.401
so cut the crap and
answer my questions.

18:55.530 --> 18:57.699
I haven't seen my
cousin in two days.

18:57.699 --> 18:59.659
You two fight about the
girl at the peep show?

18:59.659 --> 19:02.746
Peep show, Victor never
goes to peep show.

19:02.746 --> 19:03.663
How about you?

19:05.749 --> 19:08.043
I don't have to pay
money for women.

19:08.460 --> 19:13.256
At peep show, lap dance,
you spend $5.00,

19:13.256 --> 19:16.968
another $5.00.
$20 here, $20 there.

19:17.719 --> 19:20.722
By end of night, you could
have banged a hooker.

19:21.014 --> 19:24.226
Hold a real woman in
your arms instead of some...

19:24.226 --> 19:25.560
picture in your head.

19:26.061 --> 19:27.896
He knows what
I'm talking about.

19:28.647 --> 19:30.398
How'd you get the
scratches on your face?

19:30.398 --> 19:31.566
A big cat?

19:32.108 --> 19:34.611
Victor stuck me with work
ever since he come here.

19:34.611 --> 19:35.946
So you two fought.

19:35.946 --> 19:37.530
Always fight.

19:37.530 --> 19:39.366
I can't report him,
he's my cousin.

19:39.366 --> 19:41.993
But then it gets worse.

19:41.993 --> 19:44.454
So I say to him,
"no more."

19:44.454 --> 19:45.914
It doesn't matter,
he wants more.

19:45.914 --> 19:50.043
So, two nights ago,
he can't feed the lions.

19:50.043 --> 19:52.629
He wants me to feed the lions,
so I say to him,

19:52.629 --> 19:55.090
"You know, the lions,
they scare me.

19:55.090 --> 19:56.174
I'll do anything else."

19:56.174 --> 19:59.886
But no, that night
he has to go.

19:59.886 --> 20:02.097
So I just lost it.

20:06.601 --> 20:08.937
Where did he go that
he couldn't feed the lions?

20:10.897 --> 20:12.857
He only says
to me it's business.

20:13.358 --> 20:15.360
Big business, big man.

20:16.319 --> 20:18.071
All he has to do is look mean.

20:21.950 --> 20:25.036
Which, you know,
for Victor is not that difficult.

20:25.453 --> 20:27.831
He says I feed the lions,
he cut me in.

20:27.831 --> 20:28.999
But I know my cousin.

20:28.999 --> 20:31.668
He give me $5.00,
he's making $500.

20:31.668 --> 20:34.087
Plus, it's probably not legal.

20:34.838 --> 20:36.590
To scare who, Vadim?

20:38.466 --> 20:39.926
Yeah, that ...

20:39.926 --> 20:42.012
I don't know that
in any language.

20:45.932 --> 20:47.350
So you finished the post?

20:47.350 --> 20:48.810
There was water in his lungs.

20:48.810 --> 20:50.312
Okay, let's see what Speed says.

20:50.312 --> 20:51.479
Speed?

20:51.479 --> 20:52.689
It's not salt water.

20:52.689 --> 20:54.733
He didn't drown in the marina.

20:54.733 --> 20:56.151
So somebody drowned
him somewhere else

20:56.151 --> 20:57.527
and dumped him in the marina.

20:57.527 --> 20:59.029
Well, it's not city water, either.

20:59.029 --> 21:00.447
There's no trace
of the fluoride.

21:00.447 --> 21:02.782
But I did find something
to keep us honest.

21:02.782 --> 21:03.533
Go ahead.

21:03.533 --> 21:06.119
Pine freshener and
formaldehyde.

21:06.953 --> 21:08.079
Like on a boat.

21:25.722 --> 21:27.265
I'll get this over to trace.

21:27.599 --> 21:28.600
Okay.

21:30.644 --> 21:33.480
So Rick had a visitor
after we left.

21:35.523 --> 21:36.942
Somebody rousted him ...

21:39.444 --> 21:41.112
...dragged him down
to the bathroom ...

21:43.823 --> 21:45.408
... gave him a plumbing lesson.

21:51.706 --> 21:52.624
If he wasn't already dead,

21:52.624 --> 21:54.084
my money would be on Victor.

21:54.084 --> 21:57.212
Victor's cousin said that Victor
was leaning on people, right?

21:57.212 --> 22:00.590
And that he worked
for a big man.

22:01.132 --> 22:02.217
King Kong.

22:03.134 --> 22:04.803
You know, back in Louisiana...

22:04.803 --> 22:06.179
we used to keep our
animals out of the bedroom.

22:06.179 --> 22:08.723
I've got more ape hair,
and I just started lifting.

22:08.723 --> 22:10.267
So Victor was here.

22:11.726 --> 22:14.187
And maybe he was leaning
on the happy couple.

22:14.604 --> 22:15.939
Why would he be doing that?

22:16.690 --> 22:18.441
I don't know.
Let's figure it out.

22:22.571 --> 22:24.489
There's no sign of struggle here.

22:25.407 --> 22:30.120
Eighteen with a husband and
a houseboat in the marina.

22:32.205 --> 22:34.291
She probably thought
she was in paradise.

22:35.625 --> 22:38.295
Things tend to look better
from a distance, don't they?

22:38.920 --> 22:40.046
Except here.

22:40.380 --> 22:42.757
Up close and couldn't
be more personal.

22:48.680 --> 22:51.182
How come everybody
has naked pictures?

22:51.182 --> 22:52.684
Especially dopers.

22:53.184 --> 22:55.896
All these angles,
in sequence ...

22:55.896 --> 22:57.522
they used a photographer.

22:57.522 --> 23:01.276
Let's print this camera and let's
find out who took these pictures.

23:06.531 --> 23:07.824
Don't start without me, okay?

23:09.618 --> 23:10.994
Don't start without me, okay?

23:12.746 --> 23:14.122
Don't start without me, okay?

23:15.999 --> 23:17.292
Don't start without me, okay?

23:19.169 --> 23:20.170
Don't start without me, okay?

23:20.170 --> 23:21.671
Speed, you all right?

23:21.671 --> 23:23.673
Yeah, why?

23:23.673 --> 23:25.425
I went up front
to get my messages,

23:25.425 --> 23:26.718
and trace is ankle
deep in spectras.

23:26.718 --> 23:28.094
What the hell are you running?

23:28.094 --> 23:30.555
It's on the, uh,
auto sampler.

23:30.555 --> 23:31.431
I'm running the gamut.

23:31.431 --> 23:33.308
Well, dear, it's an OSHA
claim waiting to happen.

23:33.308 --> 23:34.684
You better get in there.

23:56.498 --> 23:57.540
Reservatrol?

24:04.130 --> 24:05.215
Take a look at these.

24:09.261 --> 24:11.554
These carpet impressions
are interesting.

24:25.360 --> 24:28.321
Best seat in the house.
Front and center...

24:28.947 --> 24:31.741
there's the stage.
Curtain up.

24:39.749 --> 24:40.584
All right.

24:40.584 --> 24:43.753
So, we process the floor
between the chair and the bed,

24:43.753 --> 24:47.507
particular attention
to the biologicals.

24:47.799 --> 24:48.967
I'm on it.

24:49.593 --> 24:51.678
Hey, you guys,
I've got something.

24:54.848 --> 24:56.683
The panel wasn't
on right, so I just...

24:56.683 --> 24:58.143
... popped it open.

24:58.143 --> 25:00.145
That's an Echelon MPT.

25:00.145 --> 25:02.105
I've only seen those
at gun shows.

25:02.105 --> 25:04.691
It fits the one they
used on the Russian, too.

25:05.317 --> 25:06.318
Blood on the knife.

25:06.318 --> 25:08.778
Compared it to your DB
from the peep show ...

25:08.778 --> 25:10.530
one and the same,
Victor Ratsch.

25:10.530 --> 25:12.782
Congratulations.
You found your murder weapon.

25:12.782 --> 25:15.285
Great.
Question is, who handled it?

25:15.285 --> 25:17.287
Obvious answer's the
owner of the houseboat,

25:17.287 --> 25:18.830
but someone
could've planted it.

25:18.830 --> 25:22.292
Well, sorry,
can't help you with that.

25:22.292 --> 25:24.002
Strictly DNA.

25:24.002 --> 25:26.087
All yours.
Thanks.

26:50.714 --> 26:51.756
Gotcha.

26:55.927 --> 26:59.306
So, Rick used the knife ...

26:59.598 --> 27:01.266
... to dig a spy hole.

27:01.808 --> 27:04.394
He estimated Victor's
body placement ...

27:05.020 --> 27:08.148
... and then watched
Amy wind up Victor.

27:14.404 --> 27:17.032
He braced himself against
the back of the booth...

27:18.450 --> 27:21.286
... as Rick moved in
for the kill.

27:32.964 --> 27:35.592
So, we know who
killed Victor, and why.

27:35.592 --> 27:38.470
Question is, who
killed Amy and Rick?

27:38.887 --> 27:42.015
Speed, did we get a report
on the car glass yet?

27:42.349 --> 27:44.142
I got more off this
answering machine.

27:44.142 --> 27:45.227
There's this weird sound.

27:45.227 --> 27:46.019
Okay, listen to me.

27:46.019 --> 27:48.355
We need to process the
residue on the headlight.

27:48.355 --> 27:50.774
Yeah, I got those spectras,
but you got to hear this.

27:51.816 --> 27:52.901
Ace, hi.

27:53.193 --> 27:54.402
We've got a deal.

27:56.279 --> 27:57.739
What are those clicks?

27:58.281 --> 27:59.699
That's what I'm saying.

28:01.159 --> 28:02.202
Ace, hi.

28:02.535 --> 28:03.787
We've got a deal.

28:05.330 --> 28:06.581
Click, click--
is that metal?

28:12.295 --> 28:13.338
I don't know.

28:13.755 --> 28:16.925
It sounds like the
technology is recording it,

28:17.342 --> 28:19.886
and then transforming
it into something else.

28:21.137 --> 28:23.557
Well, I got something
here more conclusive.

28:23.974 --> 28:26.685
Residue from the glass
shard from the headlamp.

28:27.727 --> 28:30.730
Reservatrol,

28:30.730 --> 28:31.856
peanut shell,

28:31.856 --> 28:34.067
hayweed,
just for starters.

28:34.067 --> 28:36.278
Clarify, please.

28:36.278 --> 28:37.195
Dung.

28:38.238 --> 28:39.739
Can you be more specific?

28:40.156 --> 28:41.324
Elephant dung.

28:43.326 --> 28:45.996
Elephant dung ...

28:45.996 --> 28:46.746
okay.

28:46.746 --> 28:48.123
On those Mercedes,

28:48.123 --> 28:51.376
let's cross-reference those
parking permits at the zoo, okay?

28:51.376 --> 28:52.460
Okay.

28:52.877 --> 28:54.629
Oh, god, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

28:54.629 --> 28:56.381
Wait. Mr. Infante?
I gotta go. Bye.

28:56.381 --> 28:57.841
We'd like to ask you
a few questions.

28:57.841 --> 28:59.884
Yes, did you make any
progress in Victor's death?

28:59.884 --> 29:01.845
We're actually here
to talk about your car.

29:01.845 --> 29:02.971
Oh, you found it?

29:02.971 --> 29:04.139
Tell me it's not stripped.

29:04.139 --> 29:05.515
So, it's still missing?

29:05.515 --> 29:07.601
Yeah. I contacted police
about it two days ago.

29:07.601 --> 29:08.393
Two days ago?

29:08.393 --> 29:10.270
The night that
Amy Cannon was killed.

29:10.270 --> 29:11.313
In a hit-and-run.

29:11.313 --> 29:12.230
Who?

29:12.230 --> 29:14.441
Amy Cannon is
the peep-show dancer...

29:14.441 --> 29:17.277
that was with Victor Ratsch
the day that he was killed.

29:17.277 --> 29:18.278
Just a sec.

29:18.278 --> 29:22.198
Hello. Yeah?
Yeah, just a sec. I...

29:23.241 --> 29:24.993
yeah, yeah.
No, I'm right ...

29:25.619 --> 29:26.578
Hey!

29:28.038 --> 29:30.123
Hey, that's a very
important call.

29:30.123 --> 29:31.499
This is a murder
investigation.

29:31.499 --> 29:33.001
Yes, I'm aware of that.

29:33.418 --> 29:35.211
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

29:35.211 --> 29:36.338
I'll let you know.

29:38.214 --> 29:39.257
Thank you.

29:40.926 --> 29:42.052
Don't go far.

29:55.288 --> 29:56.581
So, I checked for semen.

29:56.581 --> 30:00.794
Quite a job-- sheets, towels,
comforters, bedside lampshade.

30:00.794 --> 30:02.587
Multiple donors,
including the husband.

30:02.587 --> 30:03.713
What about the carpet?

30:03.713 --> 30:04.631
Well, here's the best part --

30:04.631 --> 30:06.299
only one donor,
not the husband.

30:06.299 --> 30:07.551
Not surprising.

30:07.551 --> 30:09.594
And the volume was more
than the average ejaculate.

30:09.594 --> 30:10.929
So, a repeat visitor.

30:10.929 --> 30:13.306
Who had a favorite
spot beside the chair.

30:13.306 --> 30:15.058
I don't know, I guess
he was stuck in a rut.

30:15.058 --> 30:16.518
So what do we know?

30:16.518 --> 30:18.144
That Amy had a side job.

30:18.144 --> 30:20.063
My guess is, she trolled
for 'em at the peep

30:20.063 --> 30:21.231
and reeled them
into the houseboat.

30:21.231 --> 30:22.816
Which is where the
husband joined the show.

30:22.816 --> 30:25.861
Okay, let's get a photograph
of Infante into the six-pack.

30:25.861 --> 30:28.989
You and Tripp go back
to the peep, and show it around.

30:28.989 --> 30:30.574
Out of one zoo
and into another.

30:30.574 --> 30:31.616
You got it.

30:37.914 --> 30:39.291
Recognize any of these guys?

30:40.375 --> 30:41.418
Just point.

30:44.296 --> 30:45.338
He comes here.

30:55.599 --> 30:57.684
It's got to be from
inside the car, right?

30:58.018 --> 30:59.561
Maybe she's popping her gum?

30:59.561 --> 31:02.105
No, it's not sharp enough.

31:02.105 --> 31:03.523
It's muffled.

31:03.523 --> 31:04.649
Play it again.

31:07.027 --> 31:07.986
Ace, hi.

31:08.486 --> 31:09.738
We've got a deal.

31:11.823 --> 31:14.826
Maybe she's putting
something in her purse.

31:15.160 --> 31:17.037
H said she had
a backpack.

31:22.292 --> 31:23.043
What's up?

31:23.043 --> 31:24.878
Affirmative on the I.D.

31:24.878 --> 31:26.421
Infante was a regular at the peeps?

31:26.421 --> 31:28.423
He was a semi-regular,
but when he was there ...

31:28.423 --> 31:29.799
He did it with Amy.

31:29.799 --> 31:31.801
Little lie, big lie --
he knew her.

31:31.801 --> 31:33.637
So, if we can match his DNA....

31:33.637 --> 31:35.138
to what we get off the
carpet of the houseboat,

31:35.138 --> 31:36.389
we can determine how well.

31:36.389 --> 31:38.058
Okay, but how are we going
to get a DNA reference?

31:38.058 --> 31:38.975
He'll never give it to us.

31:38.975 --> 31:39.809
We don't have to.

31:39.809 --> 31:43.355
His brand-new car will have a
theft-deterrent device on it, won't it?

31:43.355 --> 31:44.731
That's right.
Report your car stolen,

31:44.731 --> 31:47.692
company activates the
transmitter hidden in the vehicle.

31:48.401 --> 31:50.946
Owner reported the car
missing two days ago.

31:50.946 --> 31:52.739
Yeah, him and a thousand
other owners.

31:53.240 --> 31:55.325
We finally got a radio
car in the city.

31:59.079 --> 32:00.747
Hey, Sam 15's rolling now.

32:35.907 --> 32:37.033
Technology.

32:37.576 --> 32:39.661
You got to love it when
the good guys win.

32:45.375 --> 32:46.543
Wait a minute.

32:48.628 --> 32:51.756
Cracked headlamp.
Isolated impact.

32:54.801 --> 32:56.219
Got blood smears.

32:57.262 --> 32:59.055
All right.
So, we got the car.

32:59.764 --> 33:01.224
Let's get the DNA.

33:03.310 --> 33:05.604
Unlocked.
Typical.

33:05.604 --> 33:07.480
If we're looking for DNA
to match the carpet,

33:07.480 --> 33:09.191
steering wheel's
our best bet.

33:09.191 --> 33:11.067
Epithelial rich.

33:11.067 --> 33:13.278
Best place to prove who
was the last driver.

33:13.278 --> 33:14.988
This car's been reported stolen,

33:14.988 --> 33:18.116
so we have to anticipate
a mixture of DNA, right?

33:18.116 --> 33:20.118
Infante's and the car thief's.

33:21.161 --> 33:23.288
H, I thought you made
him for a liar on this.

33:23.622 --> 33:25.123
Infante is a liar.

33:25.665 --> 33:27.751
I just don't know
what the lie is yet.

33:35.717 --> 33:36.843
You want to take notes?

33:39.971 --> 33:42.474
Well, you're watching me
like you want a DNA lesson.

33:44.059 --> 33:47.646
No, I was, uh,
just admiring your ...

33:48.355 --> 33:49.231
technique.

33:49.231 --> 33:52.359
Oh. I got mad technique.
You got no idea.

33:57.447 --> 34:00.575
Primary donor on the steering
wheel matches the carpet.

34:02.577 --> 34:05.121
Yeah, that's the registered
owner of the car, Infante.

34:05.121 --> 34:06.748
Minor donor's unknown.

34:06.748 --> 34:07.916
Mixture.

34:07.916 --> 34:09.960
Well, get it in CODIS,
hope for a hit.

34:09.960 --> 34:11.168
Sounds good.

34:14.214 --> 34:16.757
Mr. Infante, how many
private peeps did you,

34:16.757 --> 34:18.760
uh, get from Amy?
Define private.

34:18.760 --> 34:20.594
Not at her place of employment.

34:20.594 --> 34:21.471
None.

34:23.556 --> 34:26.309
Look it, if I'm guilty of anything
it's being a loyal customer.

34:26.309 --> 34:28.645
I liked Amy.
I liked what she did for me.

34:28.645 --> 34:29.896
I liked how she made me feel.

34:29.896 --> 34:31.063
At Show Land?

34:31.063 --> 34:32.023
Yeah.

34:32.023 --> 34:33.692
Just at Show Land?

34:34.734 --> 34:36.319
Mr. Infante,

34:36.319 --> 34:40.157
we can confirm your DNA in her
bedroom on multiple occasions.

34:43.159 --> 34:44.202
Okay ...

34:45.245 --> 34:46.079
so what?

34:46.079 --> 34:49.123
Yeah, I was there.
Consenting adults -- nothing illegal.

34:49.123 --> 34:49.916
All right.

34:49.916 --> 34:51.793
Let me tell you how
I think it went.

34:52.835 --> 34:54.920
It started at Show Land ...

34:59.467 --> 35:00.594
First time?

35:01.136 --> 35:02.596
I'll try anything once.

35:06.933 --> 35:08.476
You couldn't get enough.

35:08.476 --> 35:12.147
Once you had a taste of Amy,
she had her hooks in you.

35:15.358 --> 35:17.444
We can go someplace
more private.

35:17.444 --> 35:21.615
No tokens. No glass.
No limitations.

35:53.355 --> 35:54.981
You can't possibly
be here because

35:54.981 --> 35:58.026
I watched two people having sex
in the privacy of their own room.

35:58.026 --> 35:59.069
No, no, no.

35:59.069 --> 36:00.237
We like you for their murder.

36:00.237 --> 36:01.154
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

36:01.154 --> 36:02.948
We know you hired Victor.

36:08.245 --> 36:09.329
And a thousand.

36:10.288 --> 36:11.456
I love Americans --

36:11.456 --> 36:13.416
they pay up front.

36:16.545 --> 36:18.630
You hired Victor
to muscle them.

36:22.175 --> 36:23.552
They were blackmailing me.

36:23.552 --> 36:24.928
And you didn't want your
palm beach donors

36:24.928 --> 36:27.305
to get wind of what you were doing
with these consenting adults?

36:27.305 --> 36:28.098
That's right.

36:28.098 --> 36:29.307
I thought it would be an
embarrassment, and frankly,

36:29.307 --> 36:31.059
I didn't think it was going
to stop at one payment.

36:31.059 --> 36:32.102
So when they killed your guy,

36:32.102 --> 36:33.728
you stepped in and
did the job yourself.

36:33.728 --> 36:35.397
A little hit-and-run,
a little drowning ...

36:35.397 --> 36:38.275
No! I told you,
my car was stolen.

36:38.275 --> 36:39.401
I didn't kill anybody.

36:39.401 --> 36:41.403
Guys we're talking
about 50, 60,000 bucks.

36:41.403 --> 36:43.155
I don't think
they were serious.

36:43.155 --> 36:45.949
I can earn that with a private
viewing with one of the gorillas.

36:49.786 --> 36:51.037
We can close this one out.

36:51.037 --> 36:52.998
I think we need to take a beat.

36:52.998 --> 36:54.374
We've got motive...

36:54.374 --> 36:55.667
opportunity.

36:55.667 --> 36:57.669
We have a very expensive
four-wheel weapon.

36:57.669 --> 36:58.879
Have you got a better idea?

36:58.879 --> 37:00.088
I think I do.

37:01.756 --> 37:03.758
Eric? You get
the minor donor?

37:03.758 --> 37:05.594
Hot off the press, boss.

37:05.594 --> 37:07.387
We got a hit off the
steering wheel.

37:07.721 --> 37:08.722
Convicted felon.

37:08.722 --> 37:09.681
Who is it?

37:09.681 --> 37:11.099
Practically family.

37:11.099 --> 37:13.602
Hello, Ace.
Nice going.

37:25.322 --> 37:26.656
Have a seat, Mr. Davis.

37:26.948 --> 37:28.366
I'll stand.

37:28.366 --> 37:30.577
I think you're going
to want to sit for this one.

37:32.662 --> 37:35.499
Lewd and lascivious
conduct, pandering,

37:35.499 --> 37:37.792
grand theft auto,
and now murder.

37:38.084 --> 37:39.669
Right, a guy gets
murdered at my shop,

37:39.669 --> 37:40.712
you want to pin it on me?

37:40.712 --> 37:43.924
Ironically, that's the one
we're not going to hang on you.

37:44.674 --> 37:47.761
You murdered
Amy and Rick Breck.

37:51.097 --> 37:53.558
Why would I bite the
hand that feeds me?

37:53.558 --> 37:55.018
Amy was a great earner.

37:55.018 --> 37:57.646
Nineteen-- looks fifteen.

37:57.646 --> 37:59.314
I couldn't keep 'em away ...

37:59.814 --> 38:02.734
with that, uh,
farm girl act.

38:03.235 --> 38:04.528
I had guys lining up.

38:04.528 --> 38:08.073
Outside your booth?
Or in their houseboat?

38:08.073 --> 38:10.408
All the girls chippee on the side.

38:10.408 --> 38:11.660
It's part of the business.

38:11.660 --> 38:12.786
Yes, it is, but you see,

38:12.786 --> 38:15.205
Rick and Amy were making
some real money off

38:15.205 --> 38:18.250
a blackmailing scheme and
not cutting you in, were they?

38:18.875 --> 38:22.671
Mr. Davis, your DNA places
you behind the wheel...

38:22.671 --> 38:24.965
of a car that killed Amy.

38:25.507 --> 38:26.883
Hey, Rick,
I'm on my way.

38:27.926 --> 38:29.970
Did you get the stuff
you promised you'd pick up?

38:30.303 --> 38:32.389
After tonight,
I could really use some.

38:36.935 --> 38:38.019
Hey.

38:38.520 --> 38:39.604
Ace, hi.

38:40.021 --> 38:41.106
We got a deal.

38:42.774 --> 38:44.234
Don't start without me, okay?

38:45.986 --> 38:47.362
Why don't you get in the car.

38:47.696 --> 38:49.239
Alone? Are you crazy?

38:49.573 --> 38:51.658
Meet me and Rick
in the houseboat.

39:01.793 --> 39:03.336
And I can assure you ...

39:03.753 --> 39:05.547
That DNA doesn't lie.

39:10.135 --> 39:11.928
We got a deal.

39:14.014 --> 39:15.140
What?

39:17.225 --> 39:18.894
The zoo guy's, uh, car?

39:18.894 --> 39:20.770
The kink lent it to me so
I'd look the other way...

39:20.770 --> 39:23.190
while he was off perving
with Amy and her husband.

39:23.190 --> 39:26.735
Then what? He, uh ...
he calls it in stolen.

39:27.360 --> 39:30.489
It sounds to me like,
uh, insurance fraud.

39:33.158 --> 39:34.951
Sounds like something
else to me.

39:35.869 --> 39:37.037
Sit down.

39:40.040 --> 39:41.541
The guy has TMJ.

39:42.501 --> 39:43.668
Cracks his jaw.

39:44.002 --> 39:45.212
That's a nervous habit.

39:48.632 --> 39:50.050
How'd you get
him on this, though?

39:50.050 --> 39:53.428
I had him give me a taped statement
about how he didn't kill anybody.

39:53.762 --> 39:55.055
And he got nervous.

39:55.472 --> 39:56.515
Very.

40:09.486 --> 40:11.029
What can I do for you, slugger?

40:11.029 --> 40:13.990
#What you gonna do
when you just found forever?#

40:13.990 --> 40:17.327
#Where you gonna get to when
you can't get it together?#

40:20.163 --> 40:22.249
#Forever and a day#

40:23.500 --> 40:26.419
#a fly gets caught
upon a spider's web#

40:26.419 --> 40:29.714
#the snake still has
another skin to shed#

40:29.714 --> 40:31.383
Well, what do
you want for this?

40:33.176 --> 40:35.136
I want you to take
the day off.

40:36.179 --> 40:39.015
Yeah?
What about tomorrow?

40:40.684 --> 40:42.435
Tomorrow is what
you make of it.

40:46.106 --> 40:48.692
#Forever and a day#

40:50.235 --> 40:51.987
#the truth be told#

40:52.612 --> 40:55.740
#you're more than
stones and rings of gold#

40:58.493 --> 41:01.037
#you can't be
bought or sold#

41:01.872 --> 41:04.916
#what you gonna do when
you just found forever?#

41:04.916 --> 41:08.461
#Where you gonna get to
when you get it together?#

41:11.673 --> 41:13.425
#each and every day.#
