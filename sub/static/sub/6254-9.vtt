Which seems to hold
great meaning for you.

12:23.869 --> 12:27.657
Squamosa is not a subterranean
or burrowing wasp.

12:27.748 --> 12:29.739
Then how did they get
in the skull?

12:29.833 --> 12:32.575
The victim was killed
and left to decompose
above ground.

his nest in the skull
before Colin was buried.

So the body was moved?
Yes.

Eight months to a year.

Why are they insisting upon
seeing their child’s bones?

All skeletons look alike
to the untrained eye.

their loved one’s remains.
They believe us.

13:46.618 --> 13:49.075
They have faith in us.

At first,
I thought we should go
full—on scientific.

anatomically on a cold,
stainless steel table.

13:57.421 --> 13:58.911
Very antiseptic.

13:59.006 --> 14:01.622
But then I thought,
“This is their son,” so—

14:01.717 --> 14:05.460
So you decided to use a cloth,
which is more reminiscent
of a shroud.

14:05.554 --> 14:08.762
They should see
that we have reverence
for their boy.

14:10.600 --> 14:13.728

we have reverence
for his parents.

for you to know...

14:18.400 --> 14:22.734
that the injury that Colin
sustained to his spine...

Damage to the metacarpals

the victim fell forward
at a high speed...

by extending his arms forward.

of the victim
watching me work.

That does not mean
that I think it is true.
