20:26.896 --> 20:29.310
-Mr. Marsh!
-Mr. Marsh, how does
it feel to be exonerated?

20:29.310 --> 20:32.620
Thank you, it feels really good
to have these charges dropped.

20:32.620 --> 20:35.965
Now we can all get back to the
business of trying to heal.

20:35.965 --> 20:37.448
I'd like to --

20:37.448 --> 20:39.241
Would you please get
the fuck away from me?

20:40.793 --> 20:43.103
I'd like to take this
opportunity to thank those

20:43.103 --> 20:45.000
who have always been my side --

20:45.000 --> 20:47.137
supporting me from
the very beginning.

20:47.137 --> 20:49.620
The people who've stood by me
since day one

20:49.620 --> 20:51.034
And gave me hope...

20:51.034 --> 20:52.482
the Whites.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.724
Thanks for having my back,
Mr. and Mrs. White.

20:56.724 --> 20:59.206
And now, everybody,
if you don't mind.

20:59.206 --> 21:01.655
I've got a farm to tend to.

21:05.896 --> 21:08.000
Well, gang, I guess
that's about it, huh?

21:08.000 --> 21:11.862
It's been a really good run but
looks like the season is over.

21:11.862 --> 21:13.896
The season is over?

21:13.896 --> 21:15.482
Well sure, the first
snow is falling.

21:15.482 --> 21:16.931
Crops are pretty much dead.

21:16.931 --> 21:18.344
But what'd ya all think, huh?

21:18.344 --> 21:19.827
I think this season
was a little better

21:19.827 --> 21:21.310
than anyone expected.

21:21.310 --> 21:23.689
I really wanna thank
you guys for a great run.

21:23.689 --> 21:27.172
And, hey, we hope you all
enjoyed the season too.

21:27.172 --> 21:29.655
It had a little bit of
everything, didn't it?

21:29.655 --> 21:32.896
And hopefully the season finale
really brought it all home.

21:32.896 --> 21:34.793
Of course, if you haven't
had a chance

21:34.793 --> 21:36.724
to try the Season Finale yet,

21:36.724 --> 21:39.172
it is available now
for a special price.

21:39.172 --> 21:41.793
This limited edition weed
made from the very last crop

21:41.793 --> 21:44.310
of the season is pricy
but worth it.

21:45.689 --> 21:49.379
