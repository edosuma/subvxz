WEBVTT

00:01.175 --> 00:02.393
PREVIOUSLY ON "THE 100"...

00:02.437 --> 00:04.352
MONTY: EARTH ISN'’T COMING BACK.

00:04.395 --> 00:05.918
SHAW: MEET PLANET ALPHA.

00:05.962 --> 00:07.659
ABBY: WE SENT
AN EXPLORATORY TEAM DOWN THERE.

00:07.703 --> 00:10.314
CLARKE: SO ANY GUESSES
WHERE ALL THE PEOPLE WENT?

00:10.358 --> 00:11.881
ALL RIGHT.
LET'’S LOAD UP.

00:11.924 --> 00:13.578
GOD, I HATE SENDING
YOU TO THE GROUND.

00:13.622 --> 00:14.884
GO SAVE US ALL.

00:14.927 --> 00:16.625
CLARKE, YOU READ THIS?

00:16.668 --> 00:18.496
"STARS ALIGN AND FORESTS WAKES,
IT'’S TIME TO RUN AWAY."

00:18.540 --> 00:19.802
CLARKE: "FOR TWO DAYS,
HEAVEN IS HELL,

00:19.845 --> 00:21.151
AND FRIENDS
BECOME FOES."

00:21.195 --> 00:22.500
JACKSON:
YOU'’RE GONNA KILL HIM.

00:22.544 --> 00:24.024
- UH! UH!
- RRGH!

00:24.067 --> 00:26.722
THIS TIME,
YOU DIE, NOT ME.

00:26.765 --> 00:29.072
CLARKE: MURPHY!

00:29.116 --> 00:30.682
RAVEN: THIS IS CLOSE
TO WHERE THEY LANDED.

00:30.726 --> 00:32.902
SPREAD OUT.

00:32.945 --> 00:34.947
- JOHN, WAKE UP.
- WHAT IS THIS?

00:37.080 --> 00:39.561
ARE YOU HERE
TO TAKE US HOME?

00:39.604 --> 00:41.911
ISN'’T THIS YOUR HOME?

00:53.618 --> 00:55.359
CLARKE: UH, GUYS...

00:55.403 --> 00:57.057
BELLAMY: REMEMBER,
WE'’RE IN THEIR HOME.

00:57.100 --> 01:00.147
- EVERYONE KEEP CALM.
- WEAPONS DOWN.

01:00.190 --> 01:01.887
BELLAMY: ABBY,
STAY WITH MURPHY.

01:01.931 --> 01:03.802
WOMAN:
ROSE, GET AWAY FROM THEM.

01:03.846 --> 01:05.065
PROTECT THE HOPE.

01:05.108 --> 01:06.457
MAN: GUARD,
TO THE FRONT.

01:06.501 --> 01:07.806
CLARKE: HEY, IT'’S OK.

01:07.850 --> 01:09.852
WE'’RE FROM EARTH.
WE COME IN PEACE.

01:09.895 --> 01:12.376
- OVER HERE.
- LISTEN TO ME. COME HERE NOW.

01:12.420 --> 01:17.642
- JONATHAN, JONATHAN...
- I'’M SORRY, LINDA.

01:17.686 --> 01:21.255
KAYLEE, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
WHERE'’S YOUR FAMILY?

01:22.647 --> 01:23.822
THEY KILLED THEM.

01:25.520 --> 01:26.912
JORDAN: THAT'’S NOT GOOD.

01:28.610 --> 01:30.829
NO, NOT NOW, NOT NOW.
EASY, EASY.

01:30.873 --> 01:32.918
CLARKE: HELP US, PLEASE.
OUR FRIEND'’S DYING.

01:32.962 --> 01:35.878
HE'’S NOT BREATHING.

01:35.921 --> 01:38.924
MAN: LET ME PASS.

01:48.891 --> 01:50.588
MOVE THEM BACK.

01:50.632 --> 01:52.112
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
HE'’LL DIE.

01:52.155 --> 01:54.636
MAN: YOU WANT MY HELP
OR NOT?

02:01.469 --> 02:03.906
HE'’S ALREADY DEAD.

02:09.041 --> 02:12.828
FORTUNATELY FOR HIM,
DEATH IS NOT THE END.

02:13.916 --> 02:15.439
CILLIAN...

02:18.181 --> 02:20.923
HE WAS EXPOSED TO THE SEAWEED
DURING THE RED SUN.

02:20.966 --> 02:23.317
DO IT.

02:31.977 --> 02:36.330
MAN: WE CALL IT KEPA-SHE,
MEANS HIDEOUS SNAKE IN CHINESE.

02:39.550 --> 02:41.161
CLARKE: OH, MY GOD.

02:41.204 --> 02:43.075
TRUST ME, I KNOW,
BUT THE VENOM DEGRADES

02:43.119 --> 02:46.122
TOO QUICKLY TO DELIVER IT
IN ANY OTHER FORM.

02:49.560 --> 02:51.736
IT'’S WORKING.

02:51.780 --> 02:53.782
AMAZING, ISN'’T IT?

02:53.825 --> 02:55.436
ITS CURATIVE PROPERTIES
WERE DISCOVERED

02:55.479 --> 02:57.786
DURING ONE OF THE EARLIEST
RED SUNS.

02:57.829 --> 03:03.444
POISON MADE THE DEMON GABRIEL
BELIEVE HE COULD WALK ON WATER.

03:03.487 --> 03:05.054
THE KEPA-SHE BIT HIM,
AND THE TOXIN

03:05.097 --> 03:06.969
FROM THE SEAWEED
HAD NO EFFECT.

03:09.058 --> 03:12.061
HE'’S BREATHING.

03:16.718 --> 03:18.850
MAN: WELL DONE, CILLIAN.

03:18.894 --> 03:22.506
NOW LOCK THEM UP.

03:22.550 --> 03:23.899
YES, SIR.
COME ON.

03:23.942 --> 03:25.117
- LET'’S GO.
- WAIT.

03:25.161 --> 03:26.554
- ON YOUR FEET.
- OK.

03:26.597 --> 03:27.685
CLARKE: WAIT.
WHERE ARE YOU TAKING US?

03:27.729 --> 03:29.687
BELLAMY: TAKE IT EASY.

03:29.731 --> 03:31.385
CLARKE: WE DIDN'’T DO
ANYTHING WRONG. GET OFF ME.

04:05.201 --> 04:06.985
BELLAMY: WHY IS HE
NOT WAKING UP?

04:07.029 --> 04:09.031
CLARKE: HE WILL.

04:09.074 --> 04:11.555
I CAN'’T BELIEVE
I DID THIS TO HIM.

04:11.599 --> 04:14.776
EMORI, YOU DIDN'’T.
I DID.

04:14.819 --> 04:19.650
OCTAVIA: WHO CARES? WE NEED
TO GET OUT OF THIS PLACE.

04:19.694 --> 04:21.826
WHAT ARE YOU
EVEN DOING HERE?

04:21.870 --> 04:24.612
I CAME TO SAVE
YOUR ASS.

04:24.655 --> 04:28.790
ECHO: BELLAMY, NO,
NOT NOW.

04:28.833 --> 04:31.575
IF WE'’RE GONNA FIGHT
OUR WAY OUT, WE NEED HER.

04:31.619 --> 04:34.230
CLARKE: ECHO, WE'’RE
NOT FIGHTING THEM.

04:34.274 --> 04:38.190
WE NEED THEM TO TEACH US
HOW TO SURVIVE DOWN HERE.

04:42.978 --> 04:45.546
WELCOME, FRIENDS.

04:45.589 --> 04:47.199
IF IT'’S TRUE YOU
SURVIVED THE RED SUN,

04:47.243 --> 04:49.811
THEN YOU NEED A DRINK.

04:51.726 --> 04:54.903
- THANK YOU.
- NO, THANKS.

04:54.946 --> 04:57.253
THANK YOU.

04:59.342 --> 05:02.911
JORDAN: MM.
THAT'’S AMAZING.

05:02.954 --> 05:04.304
- WHAT IS IT?
- WE CALL IT--

05:04.347 --> 05:07.263
- DELILAH...
- RELAX, MOTHER.

05:07.307 --> 05:10.179
I DON'’T THINK THEY'LL
STEAL YOUR RECIPE.

05:10.222 --> 05:13.095
WE CALL IT JO JUICE
AFTER JOSEPHINE PRIME.

05:13.138 --> 05:14.836
HALLOWED BE HER NAME.

05:14.879 --> 05:16.968
- HALLOWED BE HER NAME.
- HALLOWED BE HER NAME.

05:17.012 --> 05:19.928
UH, CAN I ASK--

05:19.971 --> 05:21.321
IT'’S PROBABLY NONE
OF OUR BUSINESS,

05:21.364 --> 05:24.019
BUT WHAT'’S A PRIME?

05:24.062 --> 05:27.152
SANCTUM WAS COLONIZED
BY A TEAM FROM EARTH

05:27.196 --> 05:30.199
MADE UP OF 4 FAMILIES--
THE PRIMES.

05:30.242 --> 05:32.897
THEIR BLOOD
RULES US STILL.

05:32.941 --> 05:35.944
MAN: MAKE WAY FOR THE PRIMES.

05:38.076 --> 05:39.904
- WHICH ONE'’S THE PILOT?
- THERE, THAT ONE.

05:41.906 --> 05:43.995
STOP.

05:45.997 --> 05:50.480
- DID I SAY TO TAKE HER?
- NO, SIR. SORRY, SIR.

05:50.524 --> 05:52.917
CLARKE: LOOK. IF THIS
IS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

05:52.961 --> 05:55.050
ON THE MOTHERSHIP,
YOUR PEOPLE STOLE

05:55.093 --> 05:57.835
OUR TRANSPORT AND THEN
BOARDED US BY FORCE.

05:57.879 --> 06:00.185
MY PEOPLE WERE JUST
DEFENDING THEMSELVES.

06:00.229 --> 06:05.277
LIES. SHE WASN'’T THERE.
WE HURT NO ONE.

06:05.321 --> 06:08.759
- WHAT'’S YOUR NAME?
- CLARKE GRIFFIN. WHAT'’S YOURS?

06:08.803 --> 06:11.980
HE IS RUSSELL LIGHTBOURNE,
SEVENTH OF HIS LINE,

06:12.023 --> 06:14.330
SAVIOR OF SANCTUM,
AND YOU WILL BOW

06:14.374 --> 06:16.245
BEFORE USING HIS NAME.

06:16.288 --> 06:18.247
I DON'’T THINK SO.

06:18.290 --> 06:20.728
MY WIFE'’S A STICKLER
FOR PROTOCOL,

06:20.771 --> 06:22.382
BUT SHE KNOW YOU
CAN'’T OBSERVE CUSTOMS

06:22.425 --> 06:24.079
THAT YOU'’RE UNAWARE OF.

06:24.122 --> 06:25.863
YOU HAVE QUESTIONS,
UNDERSTANDABLY,

06:25.907 --> 06:27.256
AND WE'’LL GET TO THEM ALL,
BUT FIRST, WE NEED

06:27.299 --> 06:29.258
YOUR TRANSPORT SHIP
TO BE FLOWN INTO SANCTUM.

06:29.301 --> 06:30.651
YOU CAN LAND IN ONE
OF THE LOWER FIELDS.

06:30.694 --> 06:32.914
WHY? WHAT'’S OUT THERE?

06:32.957 --> 06:34.655
WOMAN: THERE ARE WORSE
THINGS IN THIS WORLD

06:34.698 --> 06:36.787
THAN ECLIPSE-INDUCED
PSYCHOSIS.

06:36.831 --> 06:39.050
ALL OF THEM ARE
OUTSIDE THE SHIELD,

06:39.094 --> 06:40.965
AND THE WORST OF THEM
WOULD LOVE TO GET

06:41.009 --> 06:42.924
THEIR HANDS ON THE WEAPONS
KAYLEE SAYS ARE ON YOUR SHIP.

06:42.967 --> 06:44.273
KAYLEE: WHY ARE WE ASKING
FOR PERMISSION?

06:44.316 --> 06:47.232
MY FAMILY IS
ON THAT SHIP.

06:47.276 --> 06:48.669
WHICH IS WHY
YOU'’LL BE ON THE TEAM

06:48.712 --> 06:51.062
SENT TO RETRIEVE THEM.

06:51.106 --> 06:53.717
WHAT, NOW YOU'’RE AFRAID
TO LEAVE THE SHIELD?

06:53.761 --> 06:55.197
I TOLD YOU, WE WERE
LATE FOR SHELTER

06:55.240 --> 06:57.112
WHEN WE SAW THAT SHIP.

06:57.155 --> 06:59.070
EITHER WE TOOK IT OR WE
SUFFERED THE RED SUN.

06:59.114 --> 07:01.290
MOM, WHAT IS IT?

07:01.333 --> 07:03.727
MADI IS ON
THE TRANSPORT SHIP.

07:03.771 --> 07:06.382
WHAT? YOU WOKE HER?

07:06.426 --> 07:08.993
SHH...

07:09.037 --> 07:11.953
NEVER MIND.

07:11.996 --> 07:14.172
RAVEN WILL FLY THE SHIP,
BUT WE'’RE GOING, TOO.

07:14.216 --> 07:17.175
DIDN'’T REALIZE YOU WERE
GIVING THE ORDERS AGAIN, CLARKE.

07:17.219 --> 07:19.743
RUSSELL: FINE. CHOOSE YOUR
MOST DISPOSABLE PEOPLE.

07:19.787 --> 07:22.442
IT'’S TIME TO GO.

07:22.485 --> 07:24.792
YOU DON'’T STRIKE ME
AS DISPOSABLE.

07:24.835 --> 07:26.837
NONE OF US ARE,

07:26.881 --> 07:28.752
BUT MY CHILD
IS OUT THERE,

07:28.796 --> 07:30.014
SO I'’M GOING
TO GET HER.

07:30.058 --> 07:33.583
PLEASE. WE HAVE
THINGS TO DISCUSS.

07:33.627 --> 07:35.585
ARE YOU THE LEADER
OF YOUR PEOPLE, OR NOT?

07:35.629 --> 07:38.066
SHE IS.
SHE CAN SPEAK FOR US.

07:39.807 --> 07:42.418
GOOD. YOU CAN ESCORT
YOUR TEAM TO THE STEPS.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.507
THE REST OF YOU WILL
REMAIN HERE, WELL-CARED-FOR

07:44.551 --> 07:47.684
TILL WE CAN DECIDE
WHAT TO DO WITH YOU.

07:49.381 --> 07:52.733
RAVEN, ECHO.

07:52.776 --> 07:54.778
ECHO: OCTAVIA,
LET'’S GO.

07:56.867 --> 08:00.523
HEY, MILLER, YOU STAY HERE.
KEEP AN EYE ON THINGS.

08:00.567 --> 08:02.177
CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

08:02.220 --> 08:04.135
WHAT? YOU SAID IT YOURSELF.
WE NEED THESE PEOPLE.

08:04.179 --> 08:06.050
FOR SOME REASON,
THE LEADER SEEMS

08:06.094 --> 08:08.575
TO LIKE YOU, SO LET'’S
TRY AND KEEP IT THAT WAY.

08:08.618 --> 08:12.404
HEY, CLARKE,
WE'’LL BRING MADI BACK.

08:12.448 --> 08:14.711
I PROMISE.

08:17.845 --> 08:19.977
GAIA: IF YOUR MIND
IS STILL ENOUGH,

08:20.021 --> 08:21.979
THE COMMANDERS
WILL COME TO YOU.

08:22.023 --> 08:23.981
THEY WILL SHOW YOU WHAT
THEY THINK YOU NEED TO KNOW.

08:24.025 --> 08:27.115
KEEP BREATHING.

08:27.158 --> 08:30.553
GOOD. NOW TELL ME
WHO YOU SEE.

08:30.597 --> 08:33.425
I SEE CLARKE
NEEDING MY HELP.

08:33.469 --> 08:35.558
IMPOSSIBLE.

08:35.602 --> 08:37.604
A MIND CAN ONLY EXIST
IN ONE PLACE AT A TIME,

08:37.647 --> 08:41.216
AND CLARKE'’S MIND LEFT
THE FLAME AFTER THE CITY--

08:41.259 --> 08:44.045
YOU MEAN, SHE NEEDS
YOUR HELP HERE NOW.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.396
WHY AM I WASTING
MY TIME?

08:47.439 --> 08:50.051
MY THOUGHT EXACTLY.

08:50.094 --> 08:51.835
SHOULD'’VE GONE
WITH THE OTHERS.

08:51.879 --> 08:53.533
CLARKE WILL BE FINE.

08:53.576 --> 08:55.404
YOU FOCUS
SHOULD BE HERE

08:55.447 --> 08:57.188
LEARNING TO MASTER
THE FLAME.

08:57.232 --> 08:58.494
ONCE YOU DO THAT,
YOU WON'’T NEED

08:58.538 --> 09:00.191
TO ASK
FOR ITS GUIDANCE.

09:00.235 --> 09:02.672
THE WISDOM OF THE COMMANDERS
WILL BE YOURS.

09:02.716 --> 09:06.371
IT'’S NOT ALL
WISDOM, SEDA.

09:06.415 --> 09:09.026
IN MY DREAMS,

09:09.070 --> 09:12.290
I SEE A COMMANDER
WHO FRIGHTENS ME--

09:12.334 --> 09:18.035
ONE EYE, SCARS LIKE
LINES ON A MAP.

09:18.079 --> 09:20.472
HE WANTS TO SHOW
ME THINGS, BUT--

09:20.516 --> 09:23.867
SHEIDHEDA,
THE DARK COMMANDER.

09:23.911 --> 09:27.131
YOU'’RE WISE
TO RESIST HIM.

09:27.175 --> 09:28.916
I TOLD YOU, THE FLAME
AMPLIFIES EVERY COMMANDER'’S

09:28.959 --> 09:30.657
CAPACITY FOR GOOD
AND EVIL.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.572
THEY'’RE BATTLING
FOR YOUR FAVOR.

09:32.615 --> 09:35.313
THAT'’S WHY WE MUST
KEEP TRAINING EVERY DAY.

09:37.141 --> 09:39.840
DO YOU THINK
THIS IS FUNNY?

09:39.883 --> 09:42.669
NO. SAD.

09:42.712 --> 09:45.062
SHE'’S A CHILD.
YOU SHOULD LET HER BE ONE.

09:45.106 --> 09:46.847
THIS CHILD BEAT
YOUR ENTIRE ARMY

09:46.890 --> 09:48.892
WITHOUT LOSING
A SINGLE FOLLOWER.

09:48.936 --> 09:51.591
THAT WASN'’T MY ARMY.

09:51.634 --> 09:54.898
YOU BEAT A BUNCH OF CRIMINALS
LED BY A SOCIOPATH IN A BATTLE

09:54.942 --> 09:57.727
FOR A VALLEY THAT BURNED
TO THE GROUND, ANYWAY.

09:57.771 --> 10:00.425
I CALL THAT A TOTAL FAILURE
TO REACH MISSION OBJECTIVE.

10:00.469 --> 10:02.123
WATCH YOUR TONGUE.

10:02.166 --> 10:04.212
CALM DOWN, SENSEI.
I'’M TOO PREGNANT TO ARGUE.

10:04.255 --> 10:06.606
MADI: RIGHT, THE CHILD
OF TWO MASS MURDERERS.

10:06.649 --> 10:09.391
CAN'’T WAIT TO MEET HER.

10:14.352 --> 10:16.572
- UH!
- RGH!

10:16.616 --> 10:19.923
UH...

10:19.967 --> 10:22.491
DIYOZA: EVERYBODY
ON THE SHIP NOW!

10:22.534 --> 10:26.103
CLOSE THE DOOR.
POISON DARTS. MOVE!

10:26.147 --> 10:28.453
UH!

10:28.497 --> 10:30.978
UH...

11:00.660 --> 11:01.573
MAN:
SHE'’S OVER THERE.

11:10.278 --> 11:12.759
OH. OH. HEH.

11:16.110 --> 11:19.287
RUSSELL: IT'’S OK.
SHE'’S FRIENDLY.

11:21.506 --> 11:24.901
HEY, COME HERE.

11:28.557 --> 11:30.994
THEN IT IS TRUE.

11:31.038 --> 11:34.432
THEY TOLD ME THE EARTH
WAS DESTROYED.

11:34.476 --> 11:38.741
I SUPPOSE I HAD HOPE
FOR MAN'’S BEST FRIEND.

11:38.785 --> 11:43.093
SHE ALSO TOLD ME YOU WERE
ALREADY HERE WHEN SHE ARRIVED.

11:43.137 --> 11:46.009
THE RADIATION SHIELD HAS
KEPT US SAFE FOR 200 YEARS.

11:46.053 --> 11:48.751
I NEED TO KNOW
HOW YOU BREACHED IT.

11:48.795 --> 11:51.275
ONE OF OUR PEOPLE,
SHAW, WAS THE PILOT

11:51.319 --> 11:53.538
ON ELIGIUS IV.

11:53.582 --> 11:55.584
HE KNEW
THE FAILSAFE CODE.

11:55.627 --> 11:57.586
RADIATION
KILLED HIM,

11:57.629 --> 12:01.329
BUT NOT BEFORE
HE SAVED US.

12:01.372 --> 12:05.420
THANK YOU.
I'’LL DELETE THE CODE.

12:16.518 --> 12:18.738
CHILD: WAIT UP!

12:18.781 --> 12:22.829
HA HA!

12:22.872 --> 12:25.527
HAVE YOU EVER KNOWN
PEACE, CLARKE?

12:32.142 --> 12:35.145
YOU'’RE GONNA
LIKE IT HERE.

12:35.189 --> 12:38.235
- WE CAN STAY?
- I HAVEN'’T DECIDED.

12:38.279 --> 12:41.978
WE'’LL TALK ABOUT IT OVER
DINNER AT THE PALACE.

12:59.082 --> 13:01.128
WOULDN'’T SUCK
TO HAVE A WEAPON.

13:01.171 --> 13:03.260
BELLAMY: HE TOLD US,
ONLY THE GUARDS CARRY WEAPONS.

13:03.304 --> 13:04.740
ECHO:
JUST DON'’T REACT.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.611
WE'’RE TRYING TO
MAKE AN ALLIANCE.

13:06.655 --> 13:08.570
SHE CAN'’T SCREW THAT UP
IF SHE'’S WITH US.

13:08.613 --> 13:10.964
WANNA BET?

13:15.316 --> 13:17.318
HOLD UP.

13:17.361 --> 13:19.624
THERE ARE THING AND PEOPLE
IN THESE WOOD THAT WANT US DEAD.

13:19.668 --> 13:23.150
YOU FALL BEHIND,
YOU WILL BE.

13:32.594 --> 13:36.337
OH. IT'’S A DOME.

13:52.527 --> 13:55.486
CLARKE, I HAVE
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

13:55.530 --> 13:57.227
NOT GONNA HAPPEN,
JORDAN.

13:57.271 --> 13:59.142
MILLER: YOU'’VE BEEN
LOCKED INSIDE FOR 26 YEARS.

13:59.186 --> 14:01.318
WHAT'’S ONE MORE DAY?

14:01.362 --> 14:03.668
AAH! UH! UH...

14:03.712 --> 14:06.715
HEY, HEY, YOU'’RE OK.

14:06.758 --> 14:08.978
JOHN, JOHN,
THE TOXIN'’S GONE.

14:09.022 --> 14:11.415
IT'’S GONE. EVERYONE'S OK.
CLARKE, TELL HIM.

14:11.459 --> 14:14.810
IT'’S TRUE, OK?
WE ALL MADE IT, THANKS TO YOU.

14:14.854 --> 14:18.509
NO, I DIDN'’T.
I DIED, DIDN'’T I?

14:22.296 --> 14:24.733
YOUR HEART DID STOP,

14:24.776 --> 14:26.996
BUT THE PEOPLE HERE
REVIVED YOU.

14:29.259 --> 14:30.782
I SAW SOMETHING.

14:33.785 --> 14:36.614
I F--
I FELT SOMETHING.

14:36.658 --> 14:39.095
HEY, JOHN...

14:41.445 --> 14:44.187
WE SHOULD GIVE
THEM A MINUTE.

14:44.231 --> 14:46.581
LOOK AT ME.
TALK TO ME.

14:50.237 --> 14:52.543
I'’M PRETTY SURE
I'’M GOING TO HELL.

14:55.198 --> 14:57.418
JOHN...

15:08.733 --> 15:10.170
HE'’LL BE OK.

15:10.213 --> 15:13.086
HE ALWAYS IS.

15:14.261 --> 15:16.872
CLARKE...

15:16.916 --> 15:18.830
MADI WOULDN'’T
STAY IN SPACE

15:18.874 --> 15:20.702
KNOWING THAT YOU
MIGHT BE IN TROUBLE.

15:20.745 --> 15:22.486
I LEFT HER ON THE SHIP
BECAUSE I THOUGHT

15:22.530 --> 15:25.315
THAT SHE WOULD BE SAFER
WHEREVER OCTAVIA WASN'’T.

15:25.359 --> 15:26.969
I DIDN'’T KNOW.

15:27.013 --> 15:29.885
I WOULD HAVE DONE
THE SAME THING.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.932
I'’M SURPRISED SHE
LISTENED TO YOU.

15:32.975 --> 15:36.413
SHE REMINDS ME
OF SOMEBODY I KNOW.

15:36.457 --> 15:39.460
WOMAN ON P.A.: BY THE GLORY
AND GRACE OF THE PRIMES,

15:39.503 --> 15:42.332
DAILY TAI CHI IS COMMENCING NOW.

15:42.376 --> 15:44.639
MAY YOUR HEARTS BE FILLED
WITH LOVE AND LIGHT

15:44.682 --> 15:48.469
AS WE LOVE AS ONE.

15:54.997 --> 15:58.479
PRETTY SURE YOU WERE
SUPPOSED TO STAY INSIDE.

15:58.522 --> 16:02.657
RIGHT. SORRY.

16:02.700 --> 16:04.876
- IT'’S JUST--
- I'’M KIDDING.

16:06.704 --> 16:09.055
THE PRIMES WANT YOU
ISOLATED FROM US.

16:09.098 --> 16:13.015
WE'’RE NOT SUPPOSED TO
ANSWER OR ASK ANY QUESTIONS.

16:13.059 --> 16:17.237
- WHY NOT?
- THAT'’S A QUESTION.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.630
THEY CHOSE US BECAUSE
OF OUR TAVERN

16:19.674 --> 16:21.676
AND ON ACCOUNT
OF THE FACT THAT

16:21.719 --> 16:25.636
TOMORROW I BECOME
ONE OF THEM.

16:25.680 --> 16:28.291
WAIT. WHAT?

16:28.335 --> 16:33.296
DOES THAT MEAN
YOU'’RE A PRINCESS?

16:33.340 --> 16:35.472
DO I LOOK
LIKE A PRINCESS?

16:35.516 --> 16:39.346
I DON'’T KNOW. YES.

16:39.389 --> 16:41.391
I'’M NOT A PRINCESS.

16:41.435 --> 16:44.394
I WORK AND LIVE
ABOVE A TAVERN,

16:44.438 --> 16:47.310
BUT TOMORROW
IS MY NAMING DAY.

16:47.354 --> 16:49.878
I BECOME PRIYA
THE SEVENTH.

16:49.921 --> 16:52.359
HALLOWED BE
HER NAME.

16:52.402 --> 16:54.317
CLARKE: THERE YOU ARE.

16:54.361 --> 16:55.971
YOU'’RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE OUT HERE.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.060
IF THEY'’RE GONNA HELP US,

16:58.104 --> 17:00.019
WE NEED TO FOLLOW
THEIR RULES.

17:00.062 --> 17:01.890
BACK INSIDE,
BOTH OF YOU.

17:01.933 --> 17:05.024
IT'’S ALL RIGHT, CASSIUS.
HE'’S WITH ME.

17:05.067 --> 17:08.505
APOLOGIES, BUT HE
STAYS OUT OF SIGHT.

17:08.549 --> 17:11.639
THEY'’RE YOUR
ORDERS, TOO.

17:14.598 --> 17:17.471
SORRY FOR INTERRUPTING.

17:19.647 --> 17:21.910
I CAN SEE WHY
RUSSELL LIKES HER.

17:21.953 --> 17:23.564
YEAH.
SHE'’S PRETTY GREAT.

17:23.607 --> 17:25.609
I WAS ACTUALLY RAISED
ON STORIES ABOUT HER.

17:25.653 --> 17:28.960
I KNOW THAT
SOUNDS WEIRD.

17:29.004 --> 17:33.269
I LOVE STORIES.
TELL ME ONE. HEH.

17:40.929 --> 17:43.932
MAN: LET'’S
BRING IT ON HERE.

17:43.975 --> 17:46.848
NICE KNIFE.

17:46.891 --> 17:49.633
THE MAN YOU KILLED
WITH IS WAS MY FRIEND.

17:49.677 --> 17:52.767
WOMAN: GEO, LEAVE HER.

17:52.810 --> 17:55.726
GET BACK TO POSITION.
IT'’S ALMOST SECOND MOON.

17:55.770 --> 17:57.424
OH...

17:57.467 --> 17:59.904
MAN: CHILDREN OF GABRIEL,
GATHER ROUND.

18:04.387 --> 18:06.563
HOW MANY DO YOU SEE?

18:06.607 --> 18:09.175
THE DART HIT
MY BULLETPROOF VEST.

18:09.218 --> 18:13.918
I NEED TO KNOW HOW MANY.
BLINK IT OUT.

18:13.962 --> 18:16.138
MAN: DANIEL PRIME.

18:16.182 --> 18:18.009
WOMAN: FAYE
AND VICTOR, TOO.

18:18.053 --> 18:20.142
WHY NO KAYLEE?

18:20.186 --> 18:22.666
WHEN THE OLD MAN SEE THIS,
HE WILL COME BACK TO US.

18:22.710 --> 18:24.668
I KNOW HE WILL.

18:24.712 --> 18:26.931
- DEATH TO PRIMES!
- DEATH TO PRIMES!

18:26.975 --> 18:29.804
ALL: DEATH TO PRIMES!
DEATH TO PRIMES!

18:29.847 --> 18:32.067
DEATH
TO PRIMES!

18:36.245 --> 18:39.640
DEATH TO PRIMES!
DEATH TO PRIMES!

18:39.683 --> 18:43.426
DEATH TO PRIMES!
DEATH TO PRIMES!

18:45.994 --> 18:48.823
DEATH TO PRIMES!
DEATH TO PRIMES!

18:48.866 --> 18:50.999
DEATH TO PRIMES!
DEATH TO PRIMES!

18:51.042 --> 18:52.783
WE'’RE TOO LATE.

18:52.827 --> 18:54.959
LIKE HELL, WE ARE.
LET ME GO!

18:55.003 --> 18:56.961
MAN: VICTOR, FAYE, AND
DANIEL PRIME ARE LOST.

18:57.005 --> 18:59.790
YOU'’RE THE PRIORITY.
ABORT THE MISSION NOW.

18:59.834 --> 19:02.489
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
OUR PEOPLE ARE THERE.

19:02.532 --> 19:05.622
ECHO: IT'’S OK.
WE DON'’T NEED THEM.

19:05.666 --> 19:08.930
GO. WE'’LL BRING
OUR FAMILY HOME.

19:08.973 --> 19:11.106
DEATH TO PRIMES!
DEATH TO PRIMES!

19:11.150 --> 19:14.022
THIS SHOULD
BE FUN.

19:25.686 --> 19:27.949
AHH. KEEP THEM COMING.

19:27.992 --> 19:29.907
GOOD THING WE
HARVEST TONIGHT.

19:29.951 --> 19:31.082
GONNA NEED
TO MAKE MORE.

19:31.126 --> 19:33.824
HMM, YOU HARVEST
AT NIGHT?

19:35.870 --> 19:39.090
OH, THAT
IS SO COOL.

19:39.134 --> 19:41.658
I'’VE READ THAT
IT HELPS PRESERVE

19:41.702 --> 19:43.704
THE PURITY
OF THE FRUIT.

19:43.747 --> 19:45.314
IS THAT WHY?

19:45.358 --> 19:47.186
NEED TO WORK
ON YOUR GAME, KID.

19:47.229 --> 19:48.839
I OWE YOUR POPS
AT LEAST THAT MUCH.

19:48.883 --> 19:51.102
HIS GAME
IS JUST FINE.

19:51.146 --> 19:52.800
YEAH?

19:52.843 --> 19:54.715
OH, THEY GROW UP SO FAST,
DON'’T THEY?

19:58.762 --> 20:00.111
YES. THEY DO.

20:06.814 --> 20:07.641
WHAT?

20:11.210 --> 20:13.690
IT'’S JUST A DRESS.

20:13.734 --> 20:15.605
THANK YOU,
BY THE WAY.

20:15.649 --> 20:19.522
MY PLEASURE.
YOUR ESCORT'’S OUTSIDE.

20:25.267 --> 20:28.227
- YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.
- HEH.

20:28.270 --> 20:31.099
- WHAT'’S WRONG?
- "WHAT'’S WRONG?"

20:31.142 --> 20:33.536
IF I DON'’T CONVINCE
THEM TO LET US STAY,

20:33.580 --> 20:35.059
WE DIE ON A MOON WE
KNOW NOTHING ABOUT.

20:35.103 --> 20:36.974
SO CONVINCE THEM.

20:37.018 --> 20:39.586
THAT'’S IT? THAT'S
YOUR BIG PEP TALK?

20:39.629 --> 20:43.720
MARCUS IS THE
DIPLOMAT, NOT ME.

20:43.764 --> 20:45.809
MOM, I'’M SO SORRY.
I DIDN'’T EVEN ASK.

20:45.853 --> 20:47.724
IS HE OK?

20:47.768 --> 20:49.552
HE'’S BACK IN CRYO,
AND I'’M HOPING

20:49.596 --> 20:51.598
THAT THERE'’LL BE
MEDICINE HERE IN SANCTUM

20:51.641 --> 20:53.556
THAT WILL HELP HIM,
BUT WE WON'’T KNOW THAT

20:53.600 --> 20:55.906
UNLESS YOU GET THEIR
LEADERS ON OUR SIDE.

20:55.950 --> 20:58.039
- HEY...
- HMM?

20:58.082 --> 21:00.737
JUST BE YOURSELF.

21:00.781 --> 21:02.739
DON'’T TELL THEM MORE
THAN YOU HAVE TO

21:02.783 --> 21:04.741
AND DON'’T LIE.

21:04.785 --> 21:07.091
HMM, UNLESS THEY ASK
ABOUT THE END OF THE WORLD.

21:07.135 --> 21:10.747
IN THAT CASE, MAYBE DON'’T TELL
THEM YOU FIRED THE FIRST SHOT.

21:10.791 --> 21:13.228
DON'’T WORRY,
MURPHY.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.926
HELL'’S BIG ENOUGH
FOR BOTH OF US.

21:28.896 --> 21:31.420
WOMAN ON P.A.: BY THE GLORY
AND GRACE OF THE PRIMES,

21:31.464 --> 21:34.989
TONIGHT'’S HARVEST FESTIVAL
WILL BEGIN AT FIRST MOON.

21:35.032 --> 21:38.427
PLEASE JOIN US AS WE CELEBRATE
THE BOUNTY OF SANCTUM

21:38.471 --> 21:41.952
IN HOLY PREPARATION FOR
THE NAMING OF PRIYA THE SEVENTH.

21:41.996 --> 21:43.693
HALLOWED BE HER NAME.

21:43.737 --> 21:45.913
- HALLOWED BE HER NAME.
- HALLOWED BE HER NAME.

22:33.526 --> 22:37.530
WELCOME, CLARKE.
JOIN US, PLEASE.

22:43.405 --> 22:45.451
THANK YOU.

22:58.507 --> 23:01.510
- YOU MUST BE STARVING.
- I'’M FINE, ACTUALLY.

23:01.554 --> 23:03.991
DELILAH'’S FAMILY HAS BEEN
TAKING GOOD CARE OF US.

23:04.034 --> 23:05.949
THANK YOU FOR THAT.

23:05.993 --> 23:07.864
IT'’S RUDE NOT TO EAT
WHEN YOU'’RE A GUEST

23:07.908 --> 23:11.215
IN SOMEONE'’S
HOME, CLARKE.

23:11.259 --> 23:13.522
ALL RIGHT.

23:21.225 --> 23:24.228
OH, MY GOD,
IT'’S REALLY GOOD.

23:25.795 --> 23:29.277
WE LIKE OUR SIMPLE
PLEASURES HERE.

23:29.320 --> 23:32.019
WE DON'’T LIKE FINDING
STRANGERS IN OUR HOME.

23:32.062 --> 23:35.022
OH, I'’M SORRY
ABOUT THAT,

23:35.065 --> 23:38.112
BUT WE WERE RUNNING
FROM A SWARM.

23:38.155 --> 23:40.723
TRUST ME, IT'’S NOT THE WAY
THAT WE WANTED TO BE INTRODUCED.

23:40.767 --> 23:43.247
LIKE YOUR FOUNDERS
ON ELIGIUS III,

23:43.291 --> 23:46.729
WE'’RE LOOKING TO
START OVER, DO BETTER.

23:46.773 --> 23:48.470
YES. I WOULD HOPE SO,

23:48.514 --> 23:51.125
CONSIDERING YOU DESTROYED
THE PLANET OF YOUR BIRTH.

23:51.168 --> 23:53.997
ACTUALLY, I WAS
BORN IN SPACE,

23:54.041 --> 23:55.695
BUT I TAKE
YOUR POINT.

23:55.738 --> 23:58.219
LOOK.
HERE'’S THE TRUTH.

23:58.262 --> 24:00.830
WITHOUT YOUR HELP,
WE WON'’T SURVIVE HERE.

24:00.874 --> 24:02.919
YOU KNOW IT.
I KNOW IT.

24:02.963 --> 24:06.183
OUR ANCESTORS DID
DESTROY THE EARTH,

24:06.227 --> 24:09.230
BUT THEY'’RE YOUR
ANCESTORS, TOO.

24:13.756 --> 24:17.412
HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE
YOU KILLED, CLARKE...

24:17.456 --> 24:19.849
OR SHOULD WE
CALL YOU WANHEDA?

24:22.504 --> 24:24.245
HEH.

24:24.288 --> 24:27.335
MY FRIEND JORDAN
LIKES TO TALK.

24:27.378 --> 24:29.293
WHAT ELSE DID HE SAY?

24:29.337 --> 24:30.947
HE SAID YOU WENT TO
THE PROTECTED COMPOUND

24:30.991 --> 24:32.819
NOT UNLIKE THIS ONE

24:32.862 --> 24:35.038
AND MURDERED
EVERYONE INSIDE,

24:35.082 --> 24:37.737
INNOCENT MEN, WOMEN,
AND CHILDREN ALIKE.

24:37.780 --> 24:39.216
THAT WAS DIFFERENT.

24:39.260 --> 24:40.609
THE MOUNTAIN MEN WERE
GOING TO KILL EVERYONE

24:40.653 --> 24:45.396
THAT I LOVE--
MY FRIENDS, MY MOTHER.

24:45.440 --> 24:48.008
I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO
TO SAVE MY PEOPLE.

24:48.051 --> 24:50.314
WOULD YOU DO IT AGAIN?

24:50.358 --> 24:52.012
- WE WERE AT WAR.
- THAT'’S NOT WHAT I ASKED YOU.

24:52.055 --> 24:53.883
SIMONE...

24:53.927 --> 24:56.146
SIMONE: PLEASE, MY DARLING,
LET HER ANSWER.

24:56.190 --> 24:58.453
I WILL NOT APOLOGIZE

24:58.497 --> 25:00.803
FOR SAVING THE PEOPLE
THAT I LOVE.

25:00.847 --> 25:03.414
A COMFORT TO THEM,
I'’M SURE,

25:03.458 --> 25:06.069
BUT WE ARE NOT
YOUR PEOPLE,

25:06.113 --> 25:09.899
AND WE MUST PROTECT
THE PEOPLE THAT WE LOVE.

25:09.943 --> 25:13.076
KAYLEE SAID THERE ARE
400 MORE OF YOU ASLEEP

25:13.120 --> 25:17.428
ON YOUR SHIP--
WARRIORS, THIEVES, KILLERS.

25:17.472 --> 25:20.910
ALL WE'’RE ASKING FOR
IS A SECOND CHANCE.

25:24.174 --> 25:25.698
SECOND CHANCE.

25:32.052 --> 25:37.144
WHEN I WAS A BOY,
ONE OF OUR DOGS BIT MY FACE.

25:37.187 --> 25:39.581
MY FATHER LOVED THAT DOG.

25:39.625 --> 25:41.278
EVERYONE TOLD HIM
HE SHOULD PUT HIM DOWN,

25:41.322 --> 25:45.021
BUT HE COULDN'’T
BRING HIMSELF TO DO IT.

25:45.065 --> 25:48.547
"MUST HAVE BEEN MY FAULT
FOR STARTLING HIM," HE SAID.

25:48.590 --> 25:52.551
"HE DESERVES
A SECOND CHANCE."

25:52.594 --> 25:55.423
A FEW YEARS LATER,
THAT DOG ATTACKED MY BABY SISTER

25:55.466 --> 25:59.296
FOR CRAWLING NEAR HIS BOWL.

25:59.340 --> 26:02.517
SHE DIED
TWO DAYS LATER.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.563
WE CAN CHANGE.

26:04.606 --> 26:06.869
I BELIEVE
YOU WANT TO, CLARKE.

26:06.913 --> 26:09.655
I DO.

26:09.698 --> 26:12.701
I JUST DON'’T
BELIEVE YOU CAN.

26:12.745 --> 26:16.357
PLEASE UNDERSTAND,
VIOLENCE IS A CONTAGION.

26:16.400 --> 26:19.665
I'’M TRULY SORRY,
BUT I CAN'’T LET

26:19.708 --> 26:21.710
YOUR DISEASE WIPE OUT
WHAT WE MUST NOW PRESUME

26:21.754 --> 26:23.582
TO BE THE LAST
OUTPOST OF HUMANITY

26:23.625 --> 26:25.758
IN THE UNIVERSE.

26:30.284 --> 26:31.633
WHEN YOUR FRIENDS RETURN,
I SUGGEST YOU FLY

26:31.677 --> 26:33.592
BACK TO YOUR
MOTHERSHIP BECAUSE,

26:33.635 --> 26:35.724
AS YOU'’VE
RIGHTLY ASSUMED,

26:35.768 --> 26:38.118
YOU WON'’T SURVIVE
OUTSIDE THE SHIELD.

26:50.173 --> 26:52.915
GEO: SECOND MOON.
THEY'’RE ABOUT TO GRAB THE HOSTS.

26:52.959 --> 26:54.613
MAN: I'’M AWARE.

26:54.656 --> 26:56.310
GEO: SO WHAT'’S TAKING
THE EARTHLINGS SO LONG?

26:56.353 --> 26:57.746
IF THEY DON'’T GET HERE
SOON, YOUR PLAN FAILS.

26:57.790 --> 26:59.182
- I SAID, I'’M AWARE.
- GEO'’S RIGHT.

26:59.226 --> 27:00.488
WOMAN: WE'’VE WAITED
LONG ENOUGH.

27:00.531 --> 27:01.924
WE'’VE GOT THE PRIMES
AND THE GUNS.

27:01.968 --> 27:03.883
LET'’S TAKE OUR WIN
AND GO HOME.

27:03.926 --> 27:05.493
MAN: SANCTUM
IS OUR HOME.

27:05.536 --> 27:07.538
IF YOU WANT TO GO, GO,
BUT WE WON'’T ABANDON

27:07.582 --> 27:08.583
OUR PEOPLE
ON THE INSIDE.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.454
THEY KNEW THE RISKS.

27:10.498 --> 27:11.891
IF WE DON'’T GET THE SHIELD
DOWN, THEY KILL THE HOSTS,

27:11.934 --> 27:14.154
EITHER WAY,
NO NAMING DAY.

27:14.197 --> 27:15.546
ISN'’T THAT WHAT THE OLD
MAN WOULD'’VE WANTED?

27:15.590 --> 27:17.505
SUIT YOURSELF.

27:17.548 --> 27:19.115
TAKE THE HEADS AND THE WEAPONS
TO THE RENDEZVOUS.

27:19.159 --> 27:20.160
WE'’LL WAIT AS LONG AS WE CAN,
THEN FOLLOW.

27:20.203 --> 27:21.727
COPY.
DEATH IS LIFE.

27:21.770 --> 27:24.120
- DEATH IS LIFE.
- DEATH IS LIFE.

27:24.164 --> 27:26.035
BELLAMY: CAN YOU TELL
WHAT THEY'’RE SAYING?

27:26.079 --> 27:29.735
NO, BUT ONE
OF THEM'’S LEAVING,

27:29.778 --> 27:31.954
AND SHE'’S
TAKING THE GUNS.

27:31.998 --> 27:34.435
WHY WOULD THEY GIVE UP
THEIR ADVANTAGE?

27:34.478 --> 27:36.132
DOESN'’T MAKE SENSE.

27:36.176 --> 27:38.657
NO, BUT IT MAKE
A FAIR FIGHT.

27:38.700 --> 27:41.660
OK. ONCE THE GUNS
ARE CLEAR, WE GO IN--

27:41.703 --> 27:44.358
OCTAVIA: DON'’T BE AN IDIOT.
I'’M GOING FOR THE GUNS.

27:44.401 --> 27:46.012
O. DAMN IT, O.

27:47.622 --> 27:48.971
UH!

27:50.973 --> 27:53.497
BELLAMY: OCTAVIA, GET BACK.
DO NOT ENGAGE.

27:53.541 --> 27:55.804
THEY'’RE HERE. OK.
MOVE OUT NOW.

27:55.848 --> 27:57.414
BELLAMY: OCTAVIA,
THEY'’LL KILL OUR PEOPLE.

27:57.458 --> 27:59.852
DO NOT ENGAGE, O.

28:01.418 --> 28:03.638
HEY, DON'’T.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.509
MAN: ARRGH! UH!

28:05.553 --> 28:06.685
- D'’UGH!
- UGH...

28:06.728 --> 28:08.512
UH!

28:08.556 --> 28:10.297
- D'’UGH! UH!
- OHH!

28:10.340 --> 28:13.517
MAN: UH! OH!

28:13.561 --> 28:15.998
- AGH!
- UH! UH!

28:16.042 --> 28:17.826
- AH!
- ARRGH!

28:20.481 --> 28:22.048
WAAH! UH!

28:27.488 --> 28:29.664
THEY WERE WITHDRAWING.

28:29.708 --> 28:32.188
WHY THE HELL
WOULD YOU ATTACK?

28:32.232 --> 28:33.624
BELLAMY: ARE YOU
OUT OF YOUR MIND?

28:33.668 --> 28:35.365
YOU DIDN'’T HAVE
TO KILL ANYONE.

28:35.409 --> 28:37.106
WHY AREN'’T THEY MOVING?
WHAT'’S WRONG WITH THEM?

28:37.150 --> 28:39.413
PARALYTIC DARTS.

28:41.110 --> 28:42.808
LOOK. IT'’S OK.

28:42.851 --> 28:45.027
- HOW COME YOU'’RE OK?
- THEY MISSED.

28:45.071 --> 28:47.247
BELLAMY: DIYOZA, ECHO,
GET THE BODY BAGS.

28:47.290 --> 28:49.292
RAVEN, WOULD HAVE
HEARD THE GUNSHOTS.

28:49.336 --> 28:51.207
GET US IN THE AIR
BEFORE THEY COME BACK.

28:51.251 --> 28:52.861
DIYOZA: THEY WERE WAITING
FOR SOMETHING,

28:52.905 --> 28:54.733
KEPT TALKING
ABOUT A SECOND MOON.

28:54.776 --> 28:58.606
BELLAMY: WHEN YOU FIGURE OUT
WHAT THAT MEANS, LET ME KNOW.

29:03.263 --> 29:05.613
NOT YOU.

29:05.656 --> 29:08.137
OH, COME ON.

29:08.181 --> 29:11.097
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,
LEAVE ME HERE?

29:11.140 --> 29:15.754
YEAH, FOR YOUR
OWN GOOD AND OURS.

29:15.797 --> 29:17.799
MONTY GAVE HIS LIFE FOR US
SO WE COULD HAVE

29:17.843 --> 29:19.627
ANOTHER CHANCE, AND I'’M NOT
GONNA LET YOU DESTROY THAT.

29:19.670 --> 29:21.629
WE SAVED MADI,
GAIA, AND DIYOZA.

29:21.672 --> 29:23.239
WE GOT THE DAMN
SHIP BACK.

29:23.283 --> 29:25.589
WE LOST NO ONE.

29:25.633 --> 29:28.070
HOW IS THAT
A BAD THING?

29:28.114 --> 29:31.465
UNTIL YOU CAN
ANSWER THAT YOURSELF,

29:31.508 --> 29:34.381
YOU'’RE ON YOUR OWN.

29:39.299 --> 29:40.735
FINE.

29:44.304 --> 29:46.306
SHOULD HAVE DIED
IN THAT GORGE, ANYWAY.

29:46.349 --> 29:47.873
OCTAVIA...

29:53.487 --> 29:55.663
MY SISTER DIED
A LONG TIME AGO.

30:36.225 --> 30:38.227
HUH.

30:42.188 --> 30:43.667
JORDAN: HEY.

30:46.757 --> 30:48.716
I LOVE SECOND MOON.

30:48.759 --> 30:51.588
IT'’S ONLY VISIBLE FOR
A FEW MINUTES A NIGHT.

30:51.632 --> 30:53.634
THEN IT'’S GONE AGAIN.

30:55.592 --> 30:57.638
IT'’S BEAUTIFUL.

31:02.773 --> 31:05.254
WE'’RE LIKE SECOND MOON.

31:10.259 --> 31:14.220
TOMORROW
EVERYTHING CHANGES.

31:16.048 --> 31:18.224
I'’VE BEEN WAITING FOR
NAMING DAY ALL MY LIFE,

31:18.267 --> 31:21.967
AND NOW I MEET A BOY

31:22.010 --> 31:25.753
WHO MAKES ME WISH
I HAD MORE TIME.

31:27.929 --> 31:31.759
I'’M NOT GOING
ANYWHERE.

31:31.802 --> 31:35.110
JUST BECAUSE YOU BECOME
A PRINCESS, DOESN'’T MEAN--

31:40.594 --> 31:42.770
WHAT'’S WRONG?

31:42.813 --> 31:44.337
NOTHING.

31:45.642 --> 31:48.297
FULL DISCLOSURE, I--

31:48.341 --> 31:50.473
THAT WAS
MY FIRST KISS.

31:58.829 --> 32:00.657
DON'’T LET IT BE
MY LAST.

32:13.757 --> 32:17.413
RELAX. YOU'’RE GONNA
SUCK THE FIRST TIME.

32:17.457 --> 32:20.590
EVERYBODY DOES.
DON'’T WORRY.

32:22.810 --> 32:25.073
WE'’VE GOT ALL NIGHT.

32:30.905 --> 32:33.473
DELILAH?

32:33.516 --> 32:34.865
UH!

32:36.519 --> 32:38.739
DEATH TO PRIMES.

32:47.878 --> 32:49.880
EMORI: I'’M GLAD
WE'’RE HERE.

32:56.278 --> 32:58.889
I'’VE DONE BAD THINGS.

33:01.892 --> 33:03.372
JACKSON:
HA HA HA!

33:03.416 --> 33:06.897
THERE IS
NO HELL, JOHN.

33:06.941 --> 33:11.076
HEY, LISTEN TO ME.

33:14.166 --> 33:16.037
AT THE END OF OUR LIVES,
WE'’RE NOT GONNA BE JUDGED

33:16.081 --> 33:17.821
FOR THE THINGS THAT
WE DID TO SURVIVE.

33:19.649 --> 33:22.696
WE'’LL BE JUDGED FOR THE
REASONS THAT WE DID THEM.

33:25.568 --> 33:28.528
WHAT IF THE REASON WAS
TO SAVE MY OWN ASS?

33:33.707 --> 33:35.883
BACK IN YOUR
MURDER GEAR ALREADY.

33:35.926 --> 33:37.972
THAT'’S A GOOD SIGN.

33:38.016 --> 33:39.321
CLARKE,
WHAT HAPPENED?

33:39.365 --> 33:41.019
JORDAN TOLD THEM
EVERYTHING.

33:41.062 --> 33:43.238
- WHERE IS HE?
- ON THE ROOF WITH THE BARMAID.

33:51.855 --> 33:54.380
CLARKE: JORDAN...

33:54.423 --> 33:55.990
JORDAN.

33:56.034 --> 33:57.818
- JORDAN, HEY...
- DELILAH?

33:57.861 --> 33:59.646
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- DELILAH.

33:59.689 --> 34:01.735
- WHERE IS SHE? WHO DID THIS?
- NO. HEY, HE'’S HURT.

34:01.778 --> 34:06.087
- PUT HIM DOWN.
- OH, NO. WAIT. THERE. DELILAH.

34:06.131 --> 34:09.743
CASSIUS:
YOU, GET BACK HERE!

34:09.786 --> 34:12.528
THE CHILDREN OF GABRIEL
ARE IN THE COMPOUND.

34:12.572 --> 34:14.356
THEY'’LL USE THE NIGHT HARVEST
TO TRY TO GET HER OUT.

34:14.400 --> 34:17.620
- FOLLOW ME, PLEASE.
- WAIT. NO, NO, NO. NO.

34:17.664 --> 34:19.796
UHH...

34:30.764 --> 34:32.983
UH!

34:35.421 --> 34:36.770
CASSIUS: RUSSELL'’S
HERE SOMEWHERE.

34:36.813 --> 34:38.685
I HAVE TO WARN HIM.
YOU KEEP LOOKING.

34:53.395 --> 34:55.658
STOP!

34:58.139 --> 35:01.577
CLARKE: HEY!

35:01.621 --> 35:02.752
UH...

35:02.796 --> 35:03.927
- UH!
- AGH!

35:03.971 --> 35:07.409
UH! AH! UH!

35:10.630 --> 35:13.023
YOU HAVE THE BLOOD.

35:13.067 --> 35:14.764
CASSIUS: THERE.
SHE'’S GOT HIM.

35:14.808 --> 35:17.419
- UH!
- OW!

35:17.463 --> 35:19.247
- HE'’S GETTING AWAY.
- OK.

35:19.291 --> 35:21.249
HE WON'’T GET
PAST THE SHIELD.

35:21.293 --> 35:24.296
- WE'’LL GET HIM.
- SHE'’S HERE.

35:33.043 --> 35:34.828
SET A GUARD DETAIL
TO CHECK ON ROSE.

35:34.871 --> 35:37.352
TELL CILLIAN TO BRING HIS
BAG TO THE GREENHOUSE. GO.

35:44.838 --> 35:47.101
HERE.

35:53.847 --> 35:55.631
CLARKE:
WHAT WAS WRONG WITH HER?

35:55.675 --> 35:57.067
SHE LOOKED LIKE
SHE COULDN'’T MOVE.

35:57.111 --> 35:58.939
SHE COULDN'’T.

35:58.982 --> 36:00.462
THEY USED A PARALYTIC
DERIVED FROM A BEETLE

36:00.506 --> 36:02.203
MY DAUGHTER DISCOVERED
A LONG TIME AGO,

36:02.247 --> 36:03.683
WEARS OFF
IN A FEW HOURS.

36:03.726 --> 36:05.946
I DIDN'’T KNOW
YOU HAD A DAUGHTER.

36:05.989 --> 36:10.211
SHE DIED IN A FALL
6 YEARS AGO.

36:10.255 --> 36:12.822
YOUR FRIEND MURPHY
HAS RED BLOOD.

36:12.866 --> 36:15.782
MOST PEOPLE DO.

36:15.825 --> 36:18.306
WE'’RE NOT MOST
PEOPLE, ARE WE?

36:24.138 --> 36:26.096
WE HAVE THE SAME
BLOOD, CLARKE,

36:26.140 --> 36:27.794
ROYAL BLOOD.

36:27.837 --> 36:29.187
THAT'’S WHY THEY
WENT AFTER DELILAH.

36:29.230 --> 36:31.145
WOMAN: WHERE'’S RUSSELL?

36:31.189 --> 36:35.671
THE CHILDREN OF GABRIEL
GOT PAST JADE AND TOOK MY ROSE.

36:35.715 --> 36:37.543
WE KNOW THEY'’RE
STILL HERE.

36:37.586 --> 36:38.935
WE'’LL SEARCH EVERYWHERE
INSIDE THE COMPOUND.

36:38.979 --> 36:40.676
HOW DID THEY GET
INSIDE THE COMPOUND?

36:40.720 --> 36:42.243
KEEP YOUR VOICE
DOWN, MIRANDA.

36:42.287 --> 36:43.723
THAT'’S THE SECOND TIME
THE SHIELD'’S

36:43.766 --> 36:45.115
BEEN BREACHED
IN TWO DAYS.

36:45.159 --> 36:47.117
IT WASN'’T BREACHED.

36:47.161 --> 36:48.771
THE CHILDREN OF GABRIEL
KNEW WE'’D GO FOR THE SHIP.

36:48.815 --> 36:50.469
THEY WERE WAITING
WHEN WE LOWERED IT

36:50.512 --> 36:52.210
FOR KAYLEE'’S TEAM.

36:52.253 --> 36:54.690
ROSE IS STILL IN SANCTUM,
AND LET'’S GO FIND HER.

37:06.572 --> 37:09.009
RUSSELL: THIS WAS
THEIR PLAN ALL ALONG.

37:09.052 --> 37:11.098
THEY KNEW WE'’D LOWER THE
SHIELD TO LET THEM BACK IN.

37:11.141 --> 37:12.578
WE HAVE TO ASSUME
THEY HAVE ROSE.

37:12.621 --> 37:13.970
ASSEMBLE A TEAM
TO GO AFTER HER.

37:14.014 --> 37:16.712
DO IT NOW.

37:16.756 --> 37:19.715
NO. NO. NO. NO.

37:19.759 --> 37:24.764
WE'’LL GET HER BACK.
WE'’LL GET HER BACK.

37:24.807 --> 37:27.854
WOULD YOU BE SO CALM IF IT
WAS YOUR DAUGHTER'’S TURN?

37:38.343 --> 37:39.909
WE KNOW THEIR FOUNDERS
ON ELIGIUS III

37:39.953 --> 37:41.781
WERE ALL NIGHTBLOODS.

37:41.824 --> 37:43.783
ABBY: AND WE KNOW HEREDITARILY,
IT'’S INCREDIBLY RARE.

37:43.826 --> 37:47.569
PRINCESS CLARKE.
PERFECT.

37:47.613 --> 37:50.050
NOT PERFECT IF IT
MAKES HER A TARGET.

37:50.093 --> 37:53.575
CLARKE: IT DOES, WHICH IS WHY
WE CAN'’T TELL THEM ABOUT MADI...

37:55.098 --> 37:57.579
UNLESS YOU
ALREADY DID.

37:57.623 --> 37:59.755
THINK. YOU TOLD HER
EVERYTHING ELSE.

37:59.799 --> 38:02.192
I DIDN'’T
TELL HER THAT.

38:02.236 --> 38:05.587
I WAS JUST
BEING FRIENDLY.

38:05.631 --> 38:08.373
I'’M--

38:08.416 --> 38:11.506
I'’M THE REASON
THEY'’RE THROWING US OUT.

38:15.902 --> 38:17.120
MADI: CLARKE!

38:23.083 --> 38:24.954
OH, I'’M SO GLAD
TO SEE YOU.

38:24.998 --> 38:26.129
- YOU OK?
- GOOD TO SEE YOU, JORDAN.

38:26.173 --> 38:27.827
- I THINK.
- ARE WE OK?

38:27.870 --> 38:29.437
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- HEY, YEAH.

38:29.481 --> 38:31.657
- HEY, HOW ARE YOU?
- YOU LOOKED BETTER DEAD.

38:34.137 --> 38:36.575
I'’M SORRY.

38:36.618 --> 38:37.967
IT'’S NOT
YOUR FAULT, MAN.

38:44.844 --> 38:47.934
RUSSELL: IT'’S BEEN A LONG DAY,
SO I'’LL KEEP THIS SHORT.

38:47.977 --> 38:51.807
SANCTUM WAS CREATED TO BE
A SANCTUARY FOR THE HUMAN RACE.

38:51.851 --> 38:54.984
AFTER SEEING YOU SAVE DELILAH,

38:55.028 --> 38:57.900
WE'’VE DECIDED
THAT YOU DESERVE THAT, TOO.

38:57.944 --> 39:00.250
CLARKE: YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND?
WE CAN STAY?

39:00.294 --> 39:03.123
FOR NOW, BUT
NO MORE OF YOU.

39:03.166 --> 39:05.386
YOU WILL FOLLOW OUR RULES
AND RESPECT OUR TRADITIONS,

39:05.430 --> 39:07.040
AND WE WILL TEACH YOU
HOW TO SURVIVE HERE.

39:07.083 --> 39:08.911
RUSSELL: WHAT MY WIFE
IS TRYING TO SAY IS,

39:08.955 --> 39:10.783
WELCOME TO SANCTUM.

39:15.091 --> 39:16.136
OH...

39:23.883 --> 39:27.930
YOU'’RE WITH CHILD.
HOW FAR ALONG?

39:27.974 --> 39:31.107
6 MONTHS, GIVE OR TAKE.

39:31.151 --> 39:33.501
THROUGH
CRYOSLEEP, THEN?

39:33.545 --> 39:35.503
- RIGHT.
- THAT'’S REMARKABLE.

39:35.547 --> 39:37.418
IF YOU'’D LIKE,
WE CAN HAVE ONE

39:37.462 --> 39:39.028
OF OUR PRENATAL PHYSICIANS
EXAMINE YOU IN THE MORNING.

39:39.072 --> 39:41.379
I LIKE.
THANK YOU.

39:41.422 --> 39:44.207
MADI: YOU SHOULD'’VE SEEN DIYOZA
AND OCTAVIA FIGHTING TERRORISTS.

39:44.251 --> 39:46.906
WHERE IS OCTAVIA?

39:46.949 --> 39:50.475
- CHARMAINE DIYOZA?
- YES.

39:50.518 --> 39:53.260
ESCORT THIS WOMAN PAST
THE SHIELD RIGHT NOW.

39:53.303 --> 39:55.436
BELLAMY: JUST WAIT.
WHAT IS THIS?

39:55.480 --> 39:57.264
SEEMS MY REPUTATION
PRECEDES ME.

39:57.307 --> 39:58.918
YOU COULD SAY THAT.

39:58.961 --> 40:00.702
YOUR FACE IS IN
OUR HISTORY BOOKS

40:00.746 --> 40:02.530
NEXT TO HITLER
AND BIN LADEN.

40:02.574 --> 40:05.446
ABBY: PLEASE,
WHAT ABOUT THE BABY?

40:05.490 --> 40:07.709
IF ANY OF YOU WOULD CARE
TO JOIN HER, BE MY GUEST.

40:07.753 --> 40:08.928
MADI...

40:10.451 --> 40:14.237
IT'’S OK, KID.
STAY FROSTY.

40:16.370 --> 40:18.241
WE BETTER HOPE
THE TREES GET HER

40:18.285 --> 40:19.765
BEFORE THE CHILDREN
OF GABRIEL DO

40:19.808 --> 40:21.506
BECAUSE IF SHE
JOINS FORCES WITH THEM,

40:21.549 --> 40:23.333
WE'’RE GONNA NEED MORE
THAN A RADIATION SHIELD

40:23.377 --> 40:26.598
TO PROTECT US.

40:29.949 --> 40:33.605
ONE WAY OF ANOTHER,
THE DEVIL GETS HIS DUE.

40:37.435 --> 40:39.741
3 DOWN, 9 TO GO.

40:44.877 --> 40:46.922
WERE YOU FOLLOWED?
WHERE'’S DELILAH?

40:46.966 --> 40:48.228
WE MISSED HER,
BUT WE GOT ROSE.

40:48.271 --> 40:49.969
WOMAN: WHAT?

40:50.012 --> 40:51.187
A NEW HOST INTERVENED
BEFORE I COULD GET AWAY.

40:51.231 --> 40:52.537
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
A NEW HOST?

40:52.580 --> 40:55.148
FROM EARTH.
SHE HAD THE BLOOD.

40:55.191 --> 40:56.845
I SAW IT WITH
MY OWN EYES.

40:56.889 --> 40:58.412
WHERE ARE THE OTHERS?

40:58.456 --> 41:00.283
THEY TOOK HOSTAGES.
WE NEED TO QUESTION THEM.

41:00.327 --> 41:03.939
OCTAVIA: THE OTHERS ARE DEAD,
AND YOU'’RE ABOUT TO BE.

41:03.983 --> 41:06.768
MAN: CAREFUL.
THAT'’S ONE OF THEM.

41:06.812 --> 41:09.249
WE HAVE NO
QUARREL WITH YOU.

41:09.292 --> 41:12.252
YOU SHOULD
PICK UP A WEAPON.

41:16.430 --> 41:18.345
AAH! AAH!

41:18.388 --> 41:20.478
THE FOREST
IS MY WEAPON.

41:20.521 --> 41:23.132
UH! UH!

41:23.176 --> 41:25.178
OCTAVIA: UH...RRGH...

41:25.221 --> 41:27.963
MAN: WE CALL IT MACE PLANT.
DON'’T WORRY. YOU'LL SURVIVE.

41:28.007 --> 41:29.443
YOU'’LL JUST WISH YOU HADN'T.

41:31.924 --> 41:35.362
WOMAN: NICE WORK, XAVIER.
GET HER READY TO MOVE.

41:35.405 --> 41:38.147
3 PRIMES, A PILE OF GUNS,

41:38.191 --> 41:41.499
THE CHILD WITH ROYAL BLOOD,
AND A GIRL FROM EARTH--

41:41.542 --> 41:44.110
NOT BAD FOR A DAY'’S WORK.

41:44.153 --> 41:47.156
LET'’S SEE THE OLD MAN
REJECT US NOW.
