01:14.495 --> 01:16.905
Looks like
he must have split in a hurry.

01:18.499 --> 01:20.519
Shane's had plenty of time
since killing Lem

01:20.689 --> 01:22.243
to figure out an exit strategy.

01:22.503 --> 01:24.913
You have any intel
on what Shane's driving?

01:25.529 --> 01:28.184
Downtown found his truck
a couple hours ago.

01:28.354 --> 01:30.251
Unis have the plate numbers
from Mara's Lexus.

01:30.511 --> 01:32.205
Think he'll head south?

01:32.375 --> 01:34.910
Shane knows the first place
we'd look is Mexico.

01:35.080 --> 01:38.259
Only question is if he's stupid
enough to go there anyway.

01:38.943 --> 01:40.929
See anything?

01:41.189 --> 01:43.475
Couple of photos missing
from their frames.

01:43.832 --> 01:46.132
Hey, check this out.

01:46.199 --> 01:48.765
Prescription for Jackson.

01:48.832 --> 01:50.199
"Amoxicillin.

01:50.264 --> 01:53.765
Take one teaspoon
two times daily for pertussis."

01:53.832 --> 01:55.165
Yesterday's date.

01:55.231 --> 01:57.398
If Jackson's sick, they might
need to refill that soon.

01:57.465 --> 01:59.932
You keep gathering police intel
for Mara's phone call.

01:59.998 --> 02:02.331
We'll keep feeding them whatever
they need to hear

02:02.398 --> 02:04.531
until we find them.

02:04.598 --> 02:06.465
Well, then what?

02:06.531 --> 02:09.231
What if we don't find him alone?
What if Mara's with him?

02:09.298 --> 02:11.898
What, you mean his accomplice?
Mara's not an innocent.

02:11.965 --> 02:15.331
She's pregnant,
and the kid's 2.

02:20.099 --> 02:22.765
That's a decision for when
we need to make a decision.

02:27.099 --> 02:30.199
Does Lloyd ever let new people
into his life?

02:30.264 --> 02:34.331
Teenage kid? Doesn't take much
to scare a man away.

02:34.398 --> 02:37.998
I started seeing somebody
too soon after Chuck left,

02:38.065 --> 02:41.032
and I don't think Lloyd
really liked that too much.

02:41.099 --> 02:42.231
What'd he do?

02:42.298 --> 02:44.598
Well, it was one
of Lloyd's teachers

02:44.665 --> 02:46.965
when we lived back in tulsa,
and...

02:47.032 --> 02:49.965
you know what?
I don't want to talk about this.

02:50.032 --> 02:51.865
I don't want to ruin
a lovely evening.

02:52.035 --> 02:55.698
Sure, but if you ever want to
sometime...

02:55.765 --> 03:01.598
this guy went after Lloyd...
pushed him around.

03:01.768 --> 03:03.631
It was really awful.

03:03.698 --> 03:06.364
Wow.
Well, what caused that?

03:10.832 --> 03:12.998
Let's save that
for next time.

03:13.168 --> 03:15.199
Does Lloyd have any trouble

03:15.264 --> 03:18.531
getting back into his schoolwork
since...

03:18.598 --> 03:22.065
Iloyd adjusts easily
with all this moving around.

03:22.132 --> 03:24.364
It's just...

03:35.199 --> 03:36.765
we shouldn't do this.

03:36.832 --> 03:39.231
We shouldn't?

03:39.298 --> 03:41.765
This is an... an, uh...
an open case.

03:41.832 --> 03:45.032
It's still, um...
it's not right.

03:45.099 --> 03:46.665
It's crossing the line.

03:46.732 --> 03:48.665
Wasn't this a date?
A good one?

03:53.665 --> 03:55.099
Um...

03:55.165 --> 03:57.032
ri... I'm... I'm sorry.

03:57.099 --> 03:58.331
I can't do this.

03:58.398 --> 04:01.065
I'm... it's not a good idea,
Rita. I'm sorry.

04:01.132 --> 04:03.665
I'm very sorry.
I can't handle this, really.

04:03.732 --> 04:04.965
Please don't.

04:05.032 --> 04:08.865
I think we should wait,
given the circumstances,

04:08.932 --> 04:11.099
get some distance between us
and the case,

04:11.165 --> 04:12.765
then in the future,

04:12.832 --> 04:15.932
I-I can... I can definitely
see something happening.

04:18.398 --> 04:21.031
Detective Vic Mackey,
Farmington division.

04:21.099 --> 04:22.898
How can I help you,
detective?

04:22.965 --> 04:24.331
Well, can you tell me

04:24.398 --> 04:26.898
what these antibiotics
are used to treat?

04:26.965 --> 04:30.298
Oh. Pertussis
is whooping cough.

04:30.364 --> 04:32.898
Can you check if any
of the local pharmacies

04:32.965 --> 04:35.965
have refilled this prescription
in the last 24 hours?

04:36.032 --> 04:38.032
Well, medical records
are private.

04:38.099 --> 04:39.264
Oh, I know. I know.

04:39.331 --> 04:40.898
We're just trying
to track down a killer

04:40.965 --> 04:42.132
before he leaves the country.

04:42.199 --> 04:44.065
I was hoping you could give us
a head start.

04:44.132 --> 04:46.798
Well, I'd be happy
to help you, detective,

04:46.865 --> 04:49.732
if you could come back
with a subpoena.

04:49.798 --> 04:52.331
Do you have
any other police I. D?

04:52.398 --> 04:55.598
I, uh... I left my badge
in my squad house.

04:55.665 --> 04:57.565
Sorry, I can't help you.

04:57.631 --> 05:01.231
I'll be happy to call your boss,
let him know why.

05:03.732 --> 05:05.898
No, that won't
be necessary.

05:05.965 --> 05:07.565
Thanks.

05:07.631 --> 05:10.264
Every law enforcement agency
statewide

05:10.331 --> 05:12.364
has a description
of Vendrell's vehicles

05:12.431 --> 05:14.199
and recent pictures
of the family.

05:14.264 --> 05:16.665
How long you plan
to keep Shane out of the press?

05:16.732 --> 05:18.398
We'd rather have him in cuffs
before word gets out

05:18.465 --> 05:19.865
that he tried
to kill another officer.

05:19.932 --> 05:21.665
24 hours
and we haven't found him,

05:21.732 --> 05:23.498
we'll release his picture
and charges

05:23.565 --> 05:24.765
to get the public's help.

05:24.832 --> 05:26.398
I'd like to be off a desk
by then.

05:26.465 --> 05:27.865
We've already
discussed this.

05:27.932 --> 05:30.199
At least let me roll
on a strike team with Julien.

05:30.264 --> 05:32.698
Gangs aren't taking a holiday just because
some... gangs aren't your problem anymore.

05:32.765 --> 05:35.331
I'm dismantling
the strike team.

05:35.398 --> 05:37.932
That's not
your decision alone.

05:37.998 --> 05:40.565
You told me I'd have authority
over the Barn.

05:40.631 --> 05:42.465
I'm exercising
that authority.

05:42.531 --> 05:44.765
We've got the highest
arrest rate in Farmington.

05:44.832 --> 05:46.798
Who takes the credit
when we arrest Shane

05:46.865 --> 05:48.631
and haul his corrupt ass in?

05:48.801 --> 05:51.865
You don't blame the whole army
for one soldier's war crimes.

05:51.932 --> 05:54.032
Do I have the authority
or don't I?

05:54.099 --> 05:56.698
It's your house. Hope
you're doing the right thing.

05:56.765 --> 05:59.398
Julien, you'll be reassigned
to uniform duty.

05:59.465 --> 06:01.199
Captain,
I've earned the right.

06:01.264 --> 06:02.331
Yes, you did.

06:02.398 --> 06:04.331
When you pass
the detectives' exam,

06:04.398 --> 06:06.132
I'll see to it
you're promoted.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.798
In the meantime, Vendrell is
our number-one priority.

06:11.264 --> 06:13.865
When you're cleared for work,
you'll be reassigned.

06:13.932 --> 06:15.431
The strike team is my team
to run.

06:15.498 --> 06:16.565
Give me some new blood.

06:16.631 --> 06:18.732
I've had enough blood.

06:18.902 --> 06:21.732
You don't like it,
put in for a transfer.

06:26.832 --> 06:29.798
I don't like this.

06:29.865 --> 06:31.832
Me either.

06:31.898 --> 06:34.231
Can't let them
get caught.

06:34.298 --> 06:35.798
That's right.

06:35.865 --> 06:38.231
Not gonna help you find them
if somebody's gonna get hurt.

06:38.298 --> 06:40.231
Corrine, the last thing
in the world I'm gonna do

06:40.298 --> 06:41.398
is hurt them.

06:41.465 --> 06:42.698
You really expect me
to believe

06:42.765 --> 06:44.099
you're not gonna
want payback?

06:44.165 --> 06:46.264
This isn't about payback.

06:46.331 --> 06:49.932
It's about the father
of your children staying free.

06:49.998 --> 06:52.032
And the best way
we can do that

06:52.099 --> 06:55.865
is to keep Shane and Mara
a couple...

07:01.032 --> 07:03.461
you know what to do.
Now, do it.

07:04.798 --> 07:05.932
Hello?

07:05.998 --> 07:07.531
Hi, Corrine.
Tell me what you know.

07:07.598 --> 07:11.865
They're holding off releasing
Shane's picture to the press.

07:11.932 --> 07:12.965
What else?

07:13.032 --> 07:15.565
All divisions
are involved.

07:15.631 --> 07:18.698
The federal authorities
have been notified.

07:18.765 --> 07:22.498
Your pictures are being released
to borders and airports.

07:24.665 --> 07:27.398
If you give me a 50-mile radius
as to where you are,

07:27.465 --> 07:29.898
Vic can probably get
more detailed information

07:29.965 --> 07:31.898
as to exactly
where the police are.

07:31.965 --> 07:34.364
He said if we give him a 50-mile
radius of where we are,

07:34.431 --> 07:35.665
they can get
more specifics.

07:35.732 --> 07:37.231
Give me the phone.

07:37.298 --> 07:40.832
Put Vic on.
Now, Corrine. I know he's there.

07:43.032 --> 07:45.598
I'm listening.

07:45.665 --> 07:49.264
The deal was my wife speaks
to your ex-wife,

07:49.331 --> 07:51.565
not that you sit in on the call
or coach Corrine

07:51.631 --> 07:53.099
on how to pump Mara for intel.

07:53.165 --> 07:54.732
Just looking out
for you, Shane.

07:54.798 --> 07:57.631
You don't want your plan
to go to shit

07:57.698 --> 07:59.898
just like your plan
to kill me and Ronnie.

07:59.965 --> 08:01.832
That plan was solid.
You had no idea.

08:01.898 --> 08:04.798
I just couldn't get the brother
to close the deal with Ronnie.

08:04.865 --> 08:06.965
And you were waiting for me
at my place, weren't you?

08:07.032 --> 08:10.065
Least I had the Sack
to take you out myself.

08:10.132 --> 08:11.631
You're the pussy

08:11.698 --> 08:14.898
who sent some random Mexicans
to rub me out along with Rezian.

08:14.965 --> 08:16.832
What can I do for you now,
Shane?

08:16.898 --> 08:19.032
You can help me steer clear
of the police,

08:19.099 --> 08:21.732
so we both don't end up
in prison.

08:21.798 --> 08:23.698
I can't do that
if I don't know

08:23.765 --> 08:25.832
which direction
you're pointed in.

08:25.898 --> 08:27.565
I'm gonna be pointing at you
if I catch you

08:27.631 --> 08:28.965
near any one
of these calls again.

08:29.032 --> 08:30.331
And don't think
I won't be watching.

08:30.398 --> 08:31.732
I'm glad to know it.

08:31.798 --> 08:34.164
Tonight, at 10:00,
when we call this number,

08:34.231 --> 08:36.231
Corrine had better have
some new intel,

08:53.125 --> 08:54.359
what'd he say?
Shane's paranoid.

08:55.659 --> 08:58.559
The sooner we get him
out of the country, the better.

08:58.625 --> 08:59.891
What would happen to Jackson

08:59.958 --> 09:02.192
if he had whooping cough
and he stopped his meds?

09:02.258 --> 09:04.058
If he doesn't get
the right antibiotics,

09:04.125 --> 09:05.958
it could turn into pneumonia,
get dangerous.

09:06.025 --> 09:09.425
Here you go.

09:09.595 --> 09:13.158
Claudette shut down
the strike team.

09:13.225 --> 09:14.525
Holy shit.

09:14.592 --> 09:16.659
Another thing that
I've got to thank Shane for

09:16.726 --> 09:17.792
when we catch up to him.

09:21.559 --> 09:23.158
How'd the phone call
with Mara go?

09:23.225 --> 09:25.225
I wasn't able to get a 20.
Here.

09:25.292 --> 09:28.225
See if Shane tried to get
this prescription refilled

09:28.292 --> 09:29.592
anywhere around here.

09:29.659 --> 09:31.759
I'm not getting anywhere
without my goddamn badge.

09:31.826 --> 09:33.858
What are you gonna
work next?

09:33.925 --> 09:36.058
If Shane's got fake I.D. S,
who's the paper man?

09:36.125 --> 09:37.925
How's he financing
this cannonball run?

09:37.991 --> 09:39.958
He didn't ask for cash,
so he must have some.

09:40.025 --> 09:45.025
You know, we assumed that
the Mexicans who killed Rezian

09:45.092 --> 09:46.991
took his 100 grand.

09:47.058 --> 09:48.325
You think
Shane snagged it?

09:48.392 --> 09:51.125
That kind of money
could take him a long way.

09:51.192 --> 09:52.292
Yeah.

09:52.359 --> 09:54.058
Here's hoping
Jackson's cough

09:54.125 --> 09:56.092
doesn't take a turn
for the better.

09:56.158 --> 09:57.891
We need to get
out of I.a. Soon.

09:57.958 --> 10:00.258
The less moving we do
for the next day or two,

10:00.325 --> 10:01.459
the better off we are.

10:05.792 --> 10:08.058
He's still
running a fever, Shane.

10:08.125 --> 10:10.559
Hell, I'm doing
the best I can, Mara.

10:10.625 --> 10:13.158
Iook, we got to get rid
of this car.

10:13.225 --> 10:15.559
Then we can take care
of Jackson.

10:15.625 --> 10:17.659
Well, if that black asshole
you hired had done his job,

10:17.726 --> 10:19.192
then we wouldn't be running
like this.

10:19.258 --> 10:20.826
Yeah, well, I don't get
to pick and choose

10:20.891 --> 10:23.158
which guys I can hang
murder charges over.

10:23.225 --> 10:26.826
This shouldn't take long, okay?
Just wait in the car.

10:26.891 --> 10:28.225
Be careful.

10:31.925 --> 10:33.359
Hey, what's the word,
amigo?

10:36.192 --> 10:37.659
Last time
you called me amigo,

10:37.726 --> 10:39.325
I caught a four-month bid
in county.

10:39.392 --> 10:40.925
Hell, it could've been
four years

10:40.991 --> 10:42.359
with the shit
I found on you.

10:42.425 --> 10:44.925
You got any cars on this lot
with a clean Vin and papers?

10:44.991 --> 10:46.692
I'm legit.
You want to search my records?

10:46.759 --> 10:47.958
I don't have to, redding.

10:48.025 --> 10:49.726
I take three more steps
into this dump,

10:49.792 --> 10:52.125
I'm gonna come across
a boatload of stolen auto parts

10:52.192 --> 10:53.392
with the serials
burned off.

10:53.459 --> 10:54.625
What, you want me to call

10:54.692 --> 10:56.325
for an evidence truck
to come down here?

10:58.525 --> 11:00.792
I may have a car
with clean papers.

11:00.858 --> 11:02.492
Today's your lucky day.

11:02.559 --> 11:05.092
See that Lexus?
I need to unload that.

11:05.158 --> 11:07.425
Straight-up trade...
no questions asked.

11:07.492 --> 11:10.225
It just can't show up anywhere
where it can be found.

11:10.292 --> 11:11.525
So, show me what you got.

11:15.592 --> 11:16.858
I got that.

11:16.925 --> 11:19.192
Are you shitting me, man?

11:19.258 --> 11:22.991
I'm offering you a Lexus,
for Christ's sakes.

11:23.058 --> 11:24.359
She runs, my man.

11:24.425 --> 11:27.692
And it's the only car with
the paperwork that you need.

11:27.759 --> 11:30.925
No questions asked,
no calls made.

11:35.425 --> 11:38.625
I was hoping
to never wear blues again.

11:38.692 --> 11:40.525
Hey, Julien.

11:40.592 --> 11:43.559
Captain just told me
we're back riding together.

11:43.625 --> 11:45.025
Need to look
for Vendrell.

11:45.092 --> 11:46.025
Holy shit.

11:46.092 --> 11:47.325
Girl takes a long weekend,

11:47.392 --> 11:49.359
and the whole world
starts spinning backwards.

11:49.425 --> 11:51.025
Iook, since the captain
benched me,

11:51.092 --> 11:52.792
I'd appreciate
you keeping me in the loop

11:52.858 --> 11:53.958
on the whole Shane thing.

11:54.025 --> 11:55.125
Yeah, sure.

11:55.192 --> 11:57.425
I need to clear that
with Claudette.

11:57.492 --> 11:59.058
Iook,
the guy tried to kill me.

11:59.125 --> 12:00.492
If I can't be in the game,

12:00.559 --> 12:02.692
I'd like to at least
hear the play-by-play.

12:02.759 --> 12:05.692
As soon as I run that past the
captain, I will keep you posted.

12:07.692 --> 12:09.559
Okay.

12:18.392 --> 12:20.058
This whole thing
is so weird.

12:20.125 --> 12:21.925
Yeah.

12:25.726 --> 12:27.925
¿qué quieres, gringo?

12:27.991 --> 12:29.559
You know
my partner Shane?

12:29.625 --> 12:32.158
Ain't you still got to be a cop
to have a partner?

12:32.225 --> 12:33.559
You think Vic Mackey
loses his job

12:33.625 --> 12:34.726
and the streets don't hear
about it?

12:36.325 --> 12:39.592
A few months back, Shane was
in the market for some new I.D.

12:39.659 --> 12:42.392
You know anybody who could
make some good passports

12:42.459 --> 12:43.759
for him on the quick?

12:43.826 --> 12:45.392
I know
he didn't come to me.

12:45.459 --> 12:46.891
I said
they had to be good.

12:46.958 --> 12:48.492
Who?

12:48.559 --> 12:51.058
I don't got to tell ex-cop
shit anymore

12:51.125 --> 12:52.858
now that you got no badge.

12:52.925 --> 12:54.891
I might not
be a cop anymore,

12:54.958 --> 12:57.425
but I'm not
a crooked wetback, either.

12:57.492 --> 12:59.826
Why don't we call some
of my old colleagues,

12:59.891 --> 13:02.225
see whose story
they're more interested in...

13:02.292 --> 13:03.891
mine
or your illegal operation.

13:06.559 --> 13:08.592
All right,
I might know a name.

13:08.659 --> 13:10.459
But then
you're out of favors.

13:14.991 --> 13:17.925
Working on your stamp collection
there, Marcus?

13:17.991 --> 13:20.225
Who are you?
On your feet, shithead.

13:23.559 --> 13:25.125
Forging
a federal document...

13:25.192 --> 13:27.325
that's a three-year stretch,
minimum.

13:27.392 --> 13:29.958
Recognize this guy?

13:30.025 --> 13:31.858
He's a cop.
Not anymore.

13:31.925 --> 13:33.826
He skipped town
without saying goodbye.

13:33.891 --> 13:35.492
I want to send him
a postcard,

13:35.559 --> 13:37.125
but since you gave him
a new name,

13:37.192 --> 13:38.459
I don't have an address.

13:38.525 --> 13:40.025
I didn't make him
any papers.

13:40.092 --> 13:42.525
One more lie, and I'm sending
half of you to a hospital.

13:42.592 --> 13:44.425
The other half,
I'm leaving on the floor.

13:44.492 --> 13:46.891
The guy said don't talk
or else.

13:48.958 --> 13:50.659
You don't need to worry
about him anymore.

13:50.726 --> 13:52.359
You need to worry
about me.

13:52.425 --> 13:54.991
All right, I made him
three passports, okay?

13:55.058 --> 13:57.559
One for him,
and then one for his wife,

13:57.625 --> 13:59.225
and then one for his kid.

13:59.292 --> 14:00.392
Under what names?

14:00.459 --> 14:01.392
Uh...

14:04.858 --> 14:09.125
Shawn and Katie hoover,
and the kid's name is Brian.

14:14.025 --> 14:15.359
That's good quality.

14:15.425 --> 14:16.625
Thanks.

14:16.692 --> 14:18.858
Picture's not in there yet.

14:18.925 --> 14:21.425
I was just about
to do that.

14:21.492 --> 14:24.592
I'll spare you
the trouble.

14:24.659 --> 14:27.092
Cost of doing business.

14:28.292 --> 14:30.858
He's getting
even hotter, Shane.

14:30.925 --> 14:33.559
Here,
well, maybe we should, uh...

14:33.625 --> 14:35.958
we should run him
a bath again.

14:40.225 --> 14:41.325
Uh, yeah?

14:41.392 --> 14:43.991
Open the door.
Come here, honey.

14:44.058 --> 14:46.158
Okay, just, uh...
just a second.

14:49.559 --> 14:51.392
Uh... yeah?

14:51.459 --> 14:52.958
Does that kid
ever stop making noise?

14:53.025 --> 14:55.258
Yeah, we're just figuring out
a way to get his medicine.

14:55.325 --> 14:56.392
How about
figure it out quicker?

14:56.459 --> 14:57.525
I got jet lag
and a goddamn meeting

14:57.592 --> 14:58.726
I got to get
some sleep for, okay?

14:58.792 --> 15:00.158
Look, man, we're trying
the best we can.

15:00.225 --> 15:01.826
You know, most people wait
till it's dark to go to sleep.

15:01.891 --> 15:02.726
Just shut
the goddamn kid up.

15:02.792 --> 15:04.025
Hey, you know what?

15:04.092 --> 15:05.192
Why don't I take a shit
in your goddamn earholes,

15:05.258 --> 15:06.891
give you a little peace
and quiet?

15:06.958 --> 15:09.525
I'm sorry. Our kid has a fever,
and he's miserable.

15:09.592 --> 15:11.292
We're getting him
the medication.

15:11.359 --> 15:13.625
He'll be better,
and he'll be quiet real soon.

15:13.692 --> 15:15.925
I promise.

15:15.991 --> 15:17.592
Appreciate it.

15:17.659 --> 15:20.525
Thanks.

15:20.592 --> 15:23.858
Let's just get in the car,
get Jackson's medicine,

15:23.925 --> 15:26.625
and get as far away from here
as we can.

15:26.692 --> 15:28.759
You know
why crooks get caught?

15:28.826 --> 15:30.158
Because they move around.

15:30.225 --> 15:31.958
We got to be smarter
than that.

15:32.025 --> 15:33.592
We got to stay
off the roads

15:33.659 --> 15:35.559
and out of sight
as much as possible.

15:35.625 --> 15:37.058
For how long?!

15:37.125 --> 15:39.692
Well, right now, Mara, every cop
from Seattle to San diego

15:39.759 --> 15:41.359
is beating the Bush
looking for us.

15:43.325 --> 15:44.559
There's
a presidential motorcade

15:44.625 --> 15:45.858
coming through town
this weekend.

15:45.925 --> 15:47.858
It's gonna tie a lot
of those people up.

15:47.925 --> 15:49.225
It's gonna give us
the best shot

15:49.292 --> 15:50.792
that we're gonna get
to get out of here,

15:50.858 --> 15:53.359
but until then...

15:53.425 --> 15:55.258
until then,
we just got to hole up here.

15:55.325 --> 15:57.492
We still have to get Jackson
his medicine,

15:57.559 --> 15:59.192
so we have to go out
for that.

15:59.258 --> 16:00.925
Only because you left it
at home.

16:05.826 --> 16:07.492
I'll go get his medicine.

16:07.559 --> 16:08.625
Come on, buddy.

16:08.692 --> 16:12.025
Steve?

16:12.092 --> 16:13.392
Allison.

16:13.459 --> 16:15.058
Hey, mags.

16:15.125 --> 16:16.925
I told you,
don't call me that.

16:16.991 --> 16:18.726
Just happy to see you,
Margaret.

16:20.392 --> 16:23.292
I told you I mailed the check.
I'm sorry it's late again.

16:23.359 --> 16:25.325
It's fine.
That's not why we're here.

16:25.392 --> 16:27.258
Anita brohm called me
last week.

16:27.325 --> 16:29.125
Someone moved
into the Lynch house...

16:29.192 --> 16:30.692
single guy,
name's irving heap.

16:30.759 --> 16:32.425
Anita looked him up
on the internet.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.991
He's a registered
sex offender.

16:35.058 --> 16:38.192
He molested a teenage girl
in sacramento.

16:38.258 --> 16:40.459
Mags,
I'll take care of this.

16:40.525 --> 16:42.792
Don't you worry about this guy,
all right?

16:42.858 --> 16:43.826
It's what I do.

16:47.826 --> 16:50.359
Irving heap?

16:50.425 --> 16:54.258
I'm detective Wagenbach.
This is detective Billings.

16:54.325 --> 16:56.325
We hear you're new
to the neighborhood.

16:56.392 --> 16:58.258
I re-registered
two weeks ago.

16:58.325 --> 17:00.092
Yeah, well, consider us
the welcome wagon.

17:00.158 --> 17:01.858
My family lives
right down the street.

17:01.925 --> 17:03.525
I notice you're not cops
in this district.

17:03.592 --> 17:05.224
I know my rights.

17:05.291 --> 17:08.858
I'm not going anywhere near
your family or anyone else's.

17:08.925 --> 17:10.625
That what you want to hear?

17:14.157 --> 17:15.791
Steve...

17:15.858 --> 17:19.058
I am sick, detective.
That won't ever change.

17:19.125 --> 17:22.925
And I raped that girl in
sacramento, but I did my stint.

17:22.991 --> 17:25.425
I haven't touched jailbait
since,

17:25.492 --> 17:27.224
so I have just as much right
to live on this street

17:27.291 --> 17:29.925
as anyone else.

17:35.258 --> 17:38.459
Hi. Hear you responded
to the police alert.

17:38.525 --> 17:39.692
Shawn hoover.

17:39.759 --> 17:41.925
I didn't see your bulletin
until after he left.

17:41.991 --> 17:44.092
It was less
than a half-hour ago, though.

17:44.158 --> 17:46.292
Is that him?

17:46.359 --> 17:48.925
He had a young boy
with him... quite ill.

17:48.991 --> 17:50.492
Did you happen to see

17:50.559 --> 17:53.991
what kind of car he was
driving when he left? Mnh-mnh.

17:54.058 --> 17:55.991
Did he buy anything else?

17:56.058 --> 17:58.625
Yeah,
there was one other thing.

17:58.692 --> 18:01.258
Hi.

18:01.325 --> 18:03.759
Uh, gave Jackson
his medicine.

18:03.826 --> 18:06.726
The pharmacist says
if it's gonna work,

18:06.792 --> 18:10.359
it's gonna work fast,
but we got to watch him now.

18:10.425 --> 18:14.726
And, uh, we got you this.

18:19.726 --> 18:21.192
Thanks, baby.

18:21.258 --> 18:23.525
Yeah.

18:23.592 --> 18:26.559
What are those for?

18:26.625 --> 18:29.359
Um... I had an idea.

18:29.425 --> 18:31.192
The market's so bad
right now,

18:31.258 --> 18:34.025
there's all these houses
that are sitting empty.

18:34.092 --> 18:37.225
Some of them are sitting
six, eight months at a time.

18:37.292 --> 18:38.726
It's too dangerous
to squat.

18:38.792 --> 18:41.025
Yeah, but some of these houses
aren't even being shown.

18:41.092 --> 18:42.592
I mean, the owners
are just waiting

18:42.659 --> 18:43.826
for the market to rebound.

18:43.891 --> 18:46.792
Mara, we're better off
just staying still.

18:46.858 --> 18:49.225
Yeah, well, Jackson's not.

18:49.292 --> 18:51.492
I mean, this place
isn't good for him...

18:51.559 --> 18:53.092
the dust in here,
the air.

18:53.158 --> 18:54.792
Plus, baby,
if he keeps crying,

18:54.858 --> 18:56.525
more people are gonna
come checking.

19:01.459 --> 19:02.891
I just missed him.

19:02.958 --> 19:06.392
Put Shane's alias out to
all the local emergency rooms.

19:06.459 --> 19:07.659
Why all the E.r. S?

19:07.726 --> 19:09.359
Jackson might be sicker
than we thought.

19:09.425 --> 19:11.958
That's why
Shane's still in town.

19:12.025 --> 19:13.759
I'll go wide...
60-mile radius.

19:13.826 --> 19:15.325
I'm gonna check on motels

19:15.392 --> 19:17.292
and start in the area
of this pharmacy

19:17.359 --> 19:18.392
and work my way out.

19:18.459 --> 19:19.826
Shane's not stupid enough

19:19.891 --> 19:22.125
to go to a pharmacy
near where he's staying.

19:22.192 --> 19:23.792
No, but maybe
Shawn hoover is.

19:23.858 --> 19:26.292
If you do find them,
it's decision time, Vic.

19:26.359 --> 19:27.659
What about Mara?

19:27.726 --> 19:29.492
She's not an innocent.

19:29.559 --> 19:31.325
Mara knows
everything Shane does.

19:31.392 --> 19:34.425
She always has.
That's the way he wanted it.

19:34.492 --> 19:37.258
He came after us,
and she helped him.

19:37.325 --> 19:39.958
Now, if we take out Shane
and leave her,

19:40.025 --> 19:41.625
she's gonna get caught,

19:41.692 --> 19:45.392
and she's gonna start pointing
all kinds of fingers at us.

19:45.459 --> 19:46.826
Jesus Christ.

19:46.891 --> 19:48.659
What about Jackson?

19:48.726 --> 19:52.325
Jackson's too young
to be a witness.

19:55.375 --> 19:58.009
Latest research indicates
voters want their populism

19:58.575 --> 19:59.875
in small doses

19:59.942 --> 20:03.475
with competence and authority
as the main attraction.

20:04.775 --> 20:06.508
I thought your campaign
headquarters

20:06.575 --> 20:07.775
should reflect that.

20:07.842 --> 20:11.341
Quiero presentarte mi amigo,
guillermo Diaz.

20:11.408 --> 20:13.042
Mucho gusto.

20:13.109 --> 20:16.341
I met with miguel calderon
today.

20:16.408 --> 20:20.042
He's very interested
in coming on board

20:20.109 --> 20:22.775
as your campaign
finance Chief.

20:22.842 --> 20:25.241
I know miguel.
He's a good guy.

20:25.308 --> 20:28.575
But, uh, I'm inclined to head
in a different direction.

20:28.642 --> 20:30.542
Calderon starts
on Monday.

20:30.608 --> 20:32.775
Cruz, that's not
your decision.

20:32.842 --> 20:35.475
And this is a conversation
we should be having in private.

20:35.542 --> 20:39.208
You need to be very clear
on one thing.

20:39.275 --> 20:42.842
This place,
your campaign war chest,

20:42.909 --> 20:45.875
media buys,
high-dollar strategists...

20:45.942 --> 20:47.842
everything that ensures

20:47.909 --> 20:49.542
that you will be
the next mayor of Los Angeles,

20:49.608 --> 20:52.975
comes with a price.

20:53.042 --> 20:56.076
And I am very grateful
for your support,

20:56.142 --> 20:58.375
<i>but this is still
my campaign.</i>

20:58.442 --> 21:00.642
Mr. Mayor...

21:00.709 --> 21:03.442
the dick is up your ass,

21:03.508 --> 21:06.842
and I am the one, not you,

21:06.909 --> 21:10.076
who decides when and if
it comes out.

21:12.275 --> 21:13.642
¿entiendes?

21:16.975 --> 21:19.775
It was all I could do to keep
from breaking this prick's jaw.

21:19.842 --> 21:21.176
You did great.

21:21.241 --> 21:23.275
The whole point here
is to get Pezuela believing

21:23.341 --> 21:24.542
he's calling the shots.

21:24.608 --> 21:26.208
Lull him
into false complacency,

21:26.275 --> 21:28.475
he'll get overconfident,
start making mistakes.

21:28.542 --> 21:29.709
Lets us take him down.

21:29.775 --> 21:31.909
Well, this better happen
sooner than later.

21:31.975 --> 21:34.176
I have an election,
and I'm not gonna win it

21:34.241 --> 21:36.442
pretending to be
this asshole's water boy...

21:36.508 --> 21:38.909
especially in front
of his new business associate.

21:38.975 --> 21:40.109
Who's that?

21:40.176 --> 21:42.341
He introduced him
as guillermo Diaz.

21:42.408 --> 21:45.009
Pezuela's verbal beat down
was for this guy's benefit.

21:45.076 --> 21:47.508
And judging from
his obvious need to impress,

21:47.575 --> 21:50.842
I'm guessing your intel about
a cartel evaluator was dead-on.

21:50.909 --> 21:52.842
Would you be able
to pick Diaz out

21:52.909 --> 21:54.975
if we gave you
some intelligence files?

21:55.042 --> 21:57.042
Sure.

21:57.109 --> 22:00.109
Deena's tip was dead-on.
Shane and Mara were here.

22:00.176 --> 22:02.909
They traded down
for a green '91 ford taurus.

22:02.975 --> 22:04.842
Give dispatch
that plate number.

22:04.909 --> 22:06.775
You gonna let Ronnie know? No.

22:06.842 --> 22:08.608
Don't you think
he should know?

22:08.675 --> 22:11.642
Look, the whole city's working
overtime to find Vendrell.

22:11.709 --> 22:13.809
Updating Gardocki
is not my first priority.

22:25.542 --> 22:27.542
Hey, I sure hope
you can help me out.

22:27.608 --> 22:29.608
Have you seen this guy
by any chance?

22:29.675 --> 22:31.508
He's a friend.
Sorry.

22:31.575 --> 22:35.042
He's traveling with his wife
and a sick child.

22:35.109 --> 22:38.076
Shawn hoover.

22:38.142 --> 22:40.475
Iook, I picked this up
for him.

22:40.542 --> 22:42.508
His kid really needs it.

22:45.442 --> 22:47.942
Been getting a lot of complaints
about that brat crying.

22:50.076 --> 22:51.109
What room?

23:34.542 --> 23:37.042
<i>Dr. Willen, 2451.</i>

23:37.109 --> 23:39.642
<i>Dr. Willen, 2451.</i>

23:44.508 --> 23:45.709
These people look fine.

23:45.775 --> 23:48.176
Jackson's really sick.
He needs to see a doctor.

23:48.241 --> 23:49.875
What do you want me to do,
Mara?

23:49.942 --> 23:52.442
I think he's having a bad
reaction to the medication.

23:52.508 --> 23:53.742
I understand.

23:53.809 --> 23:56.308
Well, can you get
your sick son in

23:56.375 --> 23:58.675
to see a doctor now,
please?

24:03.176 --> 24:04.942
Excuse me.

24:05.009 --> 24:07.275
He wasn't there.
I missed him again.

24:07.341 --> 24:10.042
Call just came in.
City of angels hospital.

24:10.109 --> 24:12.675
Nurse at the desk
flagged Shawn hoover.

24:12.742 --> 24:15.709
He brought his son, Brian, in
with a high fever.

24:15.775 --> 24:16.742
I'm on my way.

24:16.809 --> 24:18.142
Something else...

24:18.208 --> 24:20.608
Julien and Tina tracked down
Mara's Lexus through Deena.

24:20.675 --> 24:22.208
Where?
Chop shop in sunland.

24:22.275 --> 24:24.308
He traded it
for a 1991 green ford taurus

24:24.375 --> 24:26.241
with clean plates
and registration.

24:26.308 --> 24:28.241
Claudette and company
have that info?

24:28.308 --> 24:29.809
About five minutes
before me.

24:29.875 --> 24:32.042
Got it.

24:36.076 --> 24:38.508
Margaret saw irving heap
just now.

24:38.575 --> 24:40.575
He kept staring at her,
angry,

24:40.642 --> 24:42.642
passed the house
a few times.

24:42.709 --> 24:45.475
It scared her, Steve.
What the hell did you do?

24:45.542 --> 24:48.575
I just went by his house
to put the fear of God in him.

24:48.642 --> 24:49.742
Everything is fine.

24:49.809 --> 24:50.942
How's it fine?

24:51.009 --> 24:53.408
The man's still living
on our street.

24:53.475 --> 24:54.709
I came to you for help,

24:54.775 --> 24:57.076
and whatever you said to him
made things worse.

24:57.142 --> 24:59.241
Iook, these types...
they operate in the shadows.

24:59.308 --> 25:00.909
All I'm trying to do
is draw him out.

25:00.975 --> 25:03.241
Now he sees my kids
as a threat.

25:03.308 --> 25:05.842
Nothing's going to happen
to our kids.

25:05.909 --> 25:07.675
Heap knows I'm a cop.

25:07.742 --> 25:09.608
I thought you might be able
to help.

25:14.809 --> 25:16.341
Hey.

25:16.408 --> 25:18.308
Hey.

25:18.375 --> 25:19.809
You lied to me.

25:19.875 --> 25:21.775
You goddamn bastard.

25:21.842 --> 25:22.909
Rita, wh-what...

25:22.975 --> 25:25.809
Iloyd told me everything
last night.

25:25.875 --> 25:27.109
About what?

25:27.176 --> 25:31.109
You think that he shot that kid
deliberately?

25:31.176 --> 25:33.842
You think he actually planned
to kill him?

25:33.909 --> 25:34.942
Is that true?

25:37.375 --> 25:39.909
I actually felt...

25:39.975 --> 25:41.575
I'm so stupid.

25:41.642 --> 25:43.909
I looked into something
you said.

25:43.975 --> 25:47.176
That teacher in tulsa
that pushed Lloyd around...

25:47.241 --> 25:49.475
he wanted to file
criminal charges against Lloyd.

25:49.542 --> 25:52.408
Apparently, one night when you
were out, Lloyd tied up his son

25:52.475 --> 25:55.875
and threatened to torture and kill him.
That was a game. That was a stupid game.

25:55.942 --> 25:57.208
He was never gonna do that.

25:57.275 --> 26:01.642
No, it was him acting out
on his murder fascination.

26:01.709 --> 26:04.909
You made me think
we were on a date,

26:04.975 --> 26:07.709
and all you were doing was
gathering evidence on my son.

26:07.775 --> 26:10.308
Rita...
I ought to slap you.

26:12.408 --> 26:14.076
If I were brave enough,

26:14.142 --> 26:16.442
I would slap the shit
out of you.

26:16.508 --> 26:18.775
Just don't come near us.

26:18.842 --> 26:20.176
You got that?

26:25.076 --> 26:26.875
You found
Pezuela's compadre?

26:26.942 --> 26:29.975
Yeah, I did.

26:30.042 --> 26:33.142
His name isn't Diaz.

26:33.208 --> 26:35.241
It's guillermo beltran.

26:37.408 --> 26:38.975
You're certain
that's the man you saw?

26:39.042 --> 26:40.809
Yeah, 100%. Why?

26:40.875 --> 26:43.241
You want to keep me
embedded in this jackpot,

26:43.308 --> 26:45.608
I'm entitled to know
who I'm rubbing elbows with.

26:45.675 --> 26:46.875
Guillermo beltran,

26:46.942 --> 26:49.442
former secretariat
of the presidential guard.

26:49.508 --> 26:51.275
Resigned ahead
of a corruption shake-up

26:51.341 --> 26:53.375
during the vicente fox
administration.

26:53.442 --> 26:54.909
Used his grimy affiliation

26:54.975 --> 26:57.341
to kiss himself
into the guerrero drug cartel

26:57.408 --> 26:58.642
as head of security.

26:58.709 --> 27:01.608
You know, I knew
Pezuela was hooked up, but...

27:01.675 --> 27:03.176
this guy's worldwide.

27:03.241 --> 27:05.542
He's been on the d.o.d.'s
watch list three years running.

27:05.608 --> 27:07.408
No wonder Pezuela was trying
to impress him.

27:07.475 --> 27:09.508
His boss is in town.

27:09.575 --> 27:11.909
Power player of this caliber
elevates Pezuela

27:11.975 --> 27:14.009
way beyond byz lat game level. No shit.

27:14.076 --> 27:16.508
And him taking stock
of local operations tells me

27:16.575 --> 27:19.275
the guerrero cartel wants
a seat at the table

27:19.341 --> 27:21.642
running the second biggest city
in America.

27:21.709 --> 27:24.109
I need to get Washington
in the loop.

27:24.176 --> 27:27.809
You know, from now on,
your bosses need to stop

27:27.875 --> 27:30.076
treating my mayoral campaign

27:30.142 --> 27:34.009
as some loss leader
for an I.c.E. Investigation.

27:34.076 --> 27:35.909
That's never been
the case.

27:35.975 --> 27:37.475
Oh, we both know
that it is.

27:37.542 --> 27:39.842
And it stops right now.

27:39.909 --> 27:41.742
You heard Vic turned in
his badge yesterday?

27:41.809 --> 27:43.642
I thought
he had another week.

27:43.709 --> 27:45.575
So, the way that I see it...
that leaves me

27:45.642 --> 27:48.408
to be your most important
instrument

27:48.475 --> 27:50.642
in the guerrero cartel
investigation.

27:50.709 --> 27:52.709
And you still have
our appreciation.

27:52.775 --> 27:54.542
But what I want is credit

27:54.608 --> 27:57.508
for a high-profile
international takedown,

27:57.575 --> 28:00.208
'cause
if I don't get mine...

28:00.275 --> 28:03.508
then I've never seen
this guy.

28:03.575 --> 28:06.542
I need to take care
of this irving heap situation.

28:06.608 --> 28:07.909
Heap hasn't come
anywhere near

28:07.975 --> 28:09.308
violating the terms
of his parole.

28:09.375 --> 28:11.608
I know we're not gonna
get this guy

28:11.675 --> 28:13.742
acting officially as cops.

28:13.809 --> 28:15.809
You're my partner, right?

28:17.042 --> 28:19.375
What, I'm supposed to be
Shane Vendrell

28:19.442 --> 28:22.176
to whatever Vic Mackey plan
you've hatched?

28:22.275 --> 28:25.942
Look how it worked out for them.
No, thanks.

28:26.009 --> 28:29.076
How's everything going
between you and Rita?

28:29.142 --> 28:30.942
She looked pretty pissed.

28:31.009 --> 28:33.009
Her son
committed a murder.

28:33.076 --> 28:35.542
She's starting
to realize that fact.

28:35.608 --> 28:37.275
You know,
I'm not exactly sure

28:37.341 --> 28:39.642
what lover Dutch game
you're playing there,

28:39.709 --> 28:42.142
but I know that none of it's
been above boards.

28:42.208 --> 28:44.975
Now, I was with you every step
of the way on that case.

28:45.042 --> 28:48.909
I listened to your theories.
I got you alone with the kid.

28:48.975 --> 28:51.176
Now it's your turn
to step up.

28:51.241 --> 28:53.842
I can't be a party
to anything that's unethical.

28:56.042 --> 28:58.109
I'm sorry.

29:07.176 --> 29:10.341
I've given him a shot
of a stronger antibiotic.

29:10.408 --> 29:13.375
It's gonna help
with his cough and the fever?

29:13.442 --> 29:14.875
Eventually.

29:14.942 --> 29:18.208
My immediate concern is
getting the temperature down.

29:18.275 --> 29:19.608
I want to keep him here
overnight

29:19.675 --> 29:20.809
so I can keep an eye on him.

29:20.875 --> 29:22.508
Well, is that
really necessary?

29:22.575 --> 29:24.241
I mean,
we can do that, right?

29:24.308 --> 29:25.508
I'd rather have him here.

29:25.575 --> 29:27.975
Iook, doc, it's just that
I'm starting a new job

29:28.042 --> 29:29.608
in a couple of days
up north.

29:29.675 --> 29:31.176
If I'm not there,
it's gone.

29:31.241 --> 29:32.942
Your son
shouldn't be traveling.

29:33.009 --> 29:34.975
Trust me...
we don't want that, either.

29:35.042 --> 29:36.208
Iook, it's just that

29:36.275 --> 29:38.208
I've been out of work
for a little while.

29:38.275 --> 29:39.742
And we don't
have insurance.

29:39.809 --> 29:41.275
We'll watch him
every minute.

29:41.341 --> 29:43.942
If anything goes wrong,
if his fever doesn't come down,

29:44.009 --> 29:45.842
we'll stop at a hospital
on the way.

29:45.909 --> 29:49.842
I have some samples of the
antibiotic to tide you over.

29:49.909 --> 29:51.241
I'll meet you
at the nurse's station

29:51.308 --> 29:53.009
and tell you
how they should be administered.

29:53.076 --> 29:54.275
Okay.
Thank you.

30:14.809 --> 30:17.275
Jesus Christ.

30:20.442 --> 30:24.075
Detective Keefe,
I got your call.

30:24.142 --> 30:26.175
Steve Billings.

30:26.242 --> 30:28.908
Iooks like you caught
the bastard on something.

30:28.975 --> 30:31.175
Found child pornography
in his bedroom.

30:31.242 --> 30:33.876
Second offense, so this guy's
going back to prison.

30:33.941 --> 30:35.208
Detective Wagenbach.

30:35.275 --> 30:37.475
I'm curious...
how'd you get the warrant?

30:37.542 --> 30:39.041
Anonymous tip.

30:39.108 --> 30:41.175
Really?
Where from?

30:41.242 --> 30:44.208
Don't know.
It was anonymous.

30:44.275 --> 30:45.742
Once in a while,
you get lucky.

30:47.975 --> 30:49.509
I appreciate the call.

30:49.575 --> 30:52.509
If you ever need anything,
you know where to find me.

30:56.108 --> 30:57.242
Shawn?

30:57.308 --> 30:59.142
Shawn,
got to go.

30:59.208 --> 31:00.475
I'll be right there.

31:00.542 --> 31:02.008
Let's leave it. Let's go. What?

31:02.075 --> 31:04.075
I heard two nurses talking.
They said somebody got shot.

31:04.142 --> 31:06.075
There's an ambulance,
and the police are on the way.

31:06.142 --> 31:09.342
Come on,
come on, come on.

31:15.175 --> 31:17.709
It's okay.
It's okay, Jackson.

31:17.776 --> 31:19.908
Shh. It's okay.

31:36.475 --> 31:38.675
Officer!

31:38.742 --> 31:41.175
Officer, that man over there
has a gun!

31:41.242 --> 31:43.575
Hey, you!

31:43.642 --> 31:46.375
Hey!
Stop right there.

31:46.442 --> 31:48.275
There's no problem here, guys.

31:48.342 --> 31:50.075
Stop walking now!

31:53.108 --> 31:55.041
Keep your hands
where we can see them.

31:57.242 --> 31:58.475
Are you carrying
a weapon?

31:58.542 --> 32:02.175
.357 eagle... crossdraw.

32:02.242 --> 32:04.308
Get on the ground.

32:05.975 --> 32:08.908
I said,
"get on the ground"!

32:08.975 --> 32:11.375
Now!

32:16.742 --> 32:17.941
The whole neighborhood's

32:18.008 --> 32:19.709
talking about
irving heap's arrest.

32:19.776 --> 32:21.509
Area police were already
on the job.

32:21.575 --> 32:23.876
I just gave them
an insider's nudge.

32:23.941 --> 32:25.275
Thanks, dad.

32:25.342 --> 32:27.876
I'll take you to that movie
this weekend, okay?

32:27.941 --> 32:29.442
Okay.

32:29.509 --> 32:31.776
I love you.

32:37.509 --> 32:38.876
You feel good
about yourself?

32:38.941 --> 32:40.108
Actually, I do.

32:40.175 --> 32:41.941
I'm gonna sleep a hell
of a lot better tonight

32:42.008 --> 32:43.409
knowing
my daughters are safe.

32:43.475 --> 32:46.742
You committed a crime.

32:46.809 --> 32:49.575
What crime is that?

32:52.776 --> 32:55.041
Did heap really have
that child porn,

32:55.108 --> 32:58.642
or did they plant it along with
their bogus warrant? You were there.

32:58.709 --> 33:00.075
I didn't ask,

33:00.142 --> 33:02.542
and detective Keefe did me
the courtesy of not telling.

33:02.609 --> 33:04.275
He's been clean
for six years, Steve.

33:04.342 --> 33:06.242
No, he wasn't clean.
He just hadn't been caught.

33:06.308 --> 33:08.609
And for all we know,
he was gonna stay clean.

33:08.675 --> 33:10.642
They found kiddy porn in the
guy's bedroom, for Christ's sake.

33:10.709 --> 33:12.375
Come on,
he's spot-checked twice a month.

33:12.442 --> 33:15.575
Today he just happened to leave
kiddy porn on his dresser?

33:15.642 --> 33:17.008
Please.

33:17.075 --> 33:20.675
A cop helped another cop out.
It's called loyalty.

33:20.742 --> 33:22.175
It's wrong.

33:24.575 --> 33:27.375
Yeah, well, if it's so wrong,
why don't you turn me

33:27.442 --> 33:29.709
and half the north Hollywood
division in?

33:32.442 --> 33:35.142
Vic Mackey was detained
by two police officers

33:35.208 --> 33:37.609
in a hospital
in east Hollywood tonight.

33:37.675 --> 33:38.908
Why was he held?

33:38.975 --> 33:42.175
A couple with a small child
told the officers

33:42.242 --> 33:44.709
that he had a gun
and pointed it at them.

33:44.776 --> 33:47.008
Well, that doesn't make any sense. No.

33:47.075 --> 33:50.208
So, they looked at the hospital
surveillance tape,

33:50.275 --> 33:54.442
and the couple
was Shane and Mara Vendrell.

33:56.175 --> 33:58.908
Tell me what you know about it,
and don't leave anything out.

33:58.975 --> 34:00.809
I've been chained to a desk,
remember?

34:00.876 --> 34:03.175
I don't know what Vic does
every minute of the day.

34:03.242 --> 34:05.509
Then tell me about the minutes
you do know about.

34:05.575 --> 34:07.575
Of course Vic wants
to bring Shane in,

34:07.642 --> 34:10.409
but I don't know
why they were at a hospital.

34:10.475 --> 34:11.742
I don't know
how Vic found them.

34:11.809 --> 34:13.641
Vic's gone.

34:13.708 --> 34:16.742
He left in disgrace.

34:16.809 --> 34:19.074
Now, you've got two roads
to choose from.

34:19.141 --> 34:21.609
You can either look at this
as a fresh start,

34:21.675 --> 34:24.542
or you can throw your career
away just like he's done.

34:24.609 --> 34:26.275
What do you want to do,
detective?

34:28.940 --> 34:30.242
I want my job.

34:30.308 --> 34:32.375
Then start fighting
for it.

34:32.442 --> 34:36.409
I'm gonna ask you one more time
about last night.

34:38.809 --> 34:40.775
Why does Vendrell
want you dead?

34:50.074 --> 34:52.708
Vic and I found out
that Shane killed Lem.

34:55.175 --> 34:56.308
Go on.

34:56.375 --> 34:58.575
We'd been suspecting him
for a few weeks.

34:58.642 --> 34:59.876
After all this time,

34:59.941 --> 35:01.742
trying to find the asshole
that killed our friend,

35:01.809 --> 35:03.242
things started pointing
at Shane.

35:03.308 --> 35:05.308
Just things?
The grenade.

35:05.375 --> 35:08.342
We made a bust on the
Salvadorans, confiscated some.

35:08.409 --> 35:09.876
We think
Shane held one back.

35:09.941 --> 35:11.809
What reason would Shane have
to kill Lem?

35:11.876 --> 35:12.975
I don't know.

35:13.041 --> 35:14.575
The only thing
that we could figure out

35:14.642 --> 35:16.642
was Shane's involvement
with the armenians.

35:16.709 --> 35:19.575
Shane was double dipping.
Lem found out about it.

35:19.642 --> 35:21.542
When Rezian's whole crew
wound up dead,

35:21.609 --> 35:23.709
that theory started
looking a lot better.

35:23.776 --> 35:25.342
Do you have proof
for any of this,

35:25.409 --> 35:27.175
or is this all based
on assumptions?

35:27.242 --> 35:29.709
Kavanaugh's final report...
the night Lem was killed.

35:29.776 --> 35:31.941
Shane told us he had been
followed all night long

35:32.008 --> 35:33.242
just like we had.

35:33.308 --> 35:35.142
Only Kavanaugh wrote
only Vic and I were followed.

35:35.208 --> 35:36.542
Shane lied to us.

35:36.609 --> 35:39.709
And why am I just
finding out about this now?

35:39.776 --> 35:42.208
Captain, Shane was our friend.

35:42.275 --> 35:44.409
We didn't want
to come to you

35:44.475 --> 35:47.409
until we knew
we had all the proof,

35:47.475 --> 35:49.108
and Shane must have
found out about it

35:49.175 --> 35:50.342
and tried
to have us killed.

35:50.409 --> 35:52.342
"Us"?

35:52.409 --> 35:54.475
Vic thinks that Shane
was waiting at his place

35:54.542 --> 35:55.842
personally last night.

35:55.908 --> 35:58.242
If I hadn't have called him
when my hit went sideways,

35:58.308 --> 35:59.675
Vic could be dead
right now.

35:59.742 --> 36:02.475
So, Vic went to the hospital
for revenge?

36:02.542 --> 36:04.175
No, a bullet is too good.

36:04.242 --> 36:05.776
Vic wants Shane caught.

36:05.842 --> 36:07.609
He wants him to serve time

36:07.675 --> 36:10.242
with all the other shitbags
that we put in there.

36:10.308 --> 36:12.941
We're all on the same side
on this, captain.

36:22.009 --> 36:24.009
Returning my calls
in person?

36:24.075 --> 36:27.408
Uh, better late than never.
I've got a lot on my plate.

36:27.475 --> 36:31.341
Really? 'cause I hear
you're already unemployed.

36:31.408 --> 36:34.209
I didn't want to tell you
over the phone.

36:36.508 --> 36:37.842
Quite the asshole.

36:37.909 --> 36:41.508
This is the guy I.c.E. Has been
interested in all along.

36:41.575 --> 36:44.209
Aceveda's the one
who put us onto him.

36:44.276 --> 36:46.308
Then prepare to get bitten
in the ass.

36:46.375 --> 36:48.075
The lies start with Aceveda
looking at himself

36:48.142 --> 36:49.375
in the mirror every morning.

36:49.441 --> 36:51.308
David's an open book.

36:51.375 --> 36:54.441
He has agreed to keep us advised
on beltran's involvement.

36:54.508 --> 36:56.408
Well, I'll pick up
where he leaves,

36:56.475 --> 36:59.575
get a handle
on beltran's street activities.

36:59.642 --> 37:02.075
But we're gonna have to
formalize

37:02.142 --> 37:04.308
our business relationship
on the long term.

37:04.375 --> 37:08.775
Vic, you're not a cop anymore.
You're just a C.I. Now.

37:08.842 --> 37:11.542
Then I'm not freelancing
for you people in a war zone.

37:11.608 --> 37:14.408
I need I.c.E. Credentials,
a paycheck, and full dental.

37:14.475 --> 37:17.308
That was an easier sell
before you turned your badge in.

37:17.375 --> 37:19.242
If you're no longer valuable
to Pezuela,

37:19.308 --> 37:20.742
we're not sure
you're valuable

37:20.809 --> 37:22.875
to this investigation
moving forward.

37:22.942 --> 37:24.942
Who says I'm no longer valuable
to Pezuela?

37:25.009 --> 37:26.276
I'm still on his payroll.

37:26.341 --> 37:28.475
I still have
all the cop connections I need.

37:28.542 --> 37:30.508
If anything,
being badgeless just means

37:30.575 --> 37:32.575
I have more time
to devote to his cause.

37:32.642 --> 37:34.176
We're not sure
we see it that way.

37:36.341 --> 37:39.542
I've been keeping you
out of jail and in a job.

37:39.608 --> 37:41.809
When that box shows up
with your file in it,

37:41.875 --> 37:43.708
you'll see
how goddamn valuable I am.

37:45.542 --> 37:48.042
Listen,
just give me some time

37:48.109 --> 37:51.109
to get cozied up
to this beltran guy.

37:51.176 --> 37:54.542
You'll see I'm still the man
on the inside.

37:54.608 --> 37:56.475
I helped you
out of your jam.

37:56.542 --> 37:58.308
You can help me
out of mine.

37:58.375 --> 38:01.276
Rita.

38:01.341 --> 38:04.809
Why are you so convinced
Lloyd's a murderer?

38:06.875 --> 38:07.975
Come in.

38:11.842 --> 38:15.675
I went home last night
after seeing you,

38:15.742 --> 38:19.075
and he and I
got into an argument.

38:19.142 --> 38:21.276
About what?

38:21.341 --> 38:22.875
You.

38:25.375 --> 38:27.375
I told him that we kissed

38:27.441 --> 38:31.042
and that I was hoping
that we could start dating.

38:31.109 --> 38:33.075
I thought he'd be happy,

38:33.142 --> 38:37.075
because you'd been so good
to us.

38:37.142 --> 38:41.176
And he called me pathetic.

38:41.242 --> 38:43.075
Then he started laughing
at me,

38:43.142 --> 38:46.508
because I'd thought
that you were interested.

38:46.575 --> 38:49.508
Then he said
that you ruined me for him.

38:49.575 --> 38:51.109
What does that mean?

38:51.176 --> 38:53.508
You need to get away
from him.

38:53.575 --> 38:57.075
He's not an abusive husband
or a cheating boyfriend.

38:57.142 --> 38:58.608
He's my son.

38:58.675 --> 39:01.642
I cook dinner for him.
I drive him to school.

39:01.708 --> 39:04.775
I wash his clothes.
I can't walk away from him.

39:04.842 --> 39:09.708
Bring him into the Barn.
Help me convince him to confess.

39:09.775 --> 39:11.909
And what if he doesn't...
if he's innocent?

39:11.975 --> 39:13.642
He's not.

39:13.708 --> 39:15.742
You can't prove that.

39:15.809 --> 39:17.142
We both know it.

39:17.209 --> 39:18.276
He's my boy!

39:18.341 --> 39:21.242
Every killer this world
has ever seen

39:21.308 --> 39:23.209
started out
as somebody's boy.

39:24.608 --> 39:27.341
Iloyd is gonna kill
somebody else eventually...

39:27.408 --> 39:29.642
someone else's son
or daughter...

39:29.708 --> 39:32.176
unless you help me stop him.
I don't believe that.

39:32.242 --> 39:33.341
I don't believe that!

39:33.408 --> 39:34.909
No.

39:42.375 --> 39:44.575
What if Shane saw you
coming here?

39:44.642 --> 39:46.142
He didn't.
I made sure.

39:46.209 --> 39:48.375
Don't worry about it.

39:50.341 --> 39:52.142
Hey, cass.

39:52.209 --> 39:54.608
Dad.

39:54.675 --> 39:56.542
What are you doing here
so late?

39:56.608 --> 39:59.209
Oh, your mother and I
have an important phone call.

39:59.276 --> 40:01.875
Listen, kid, you should
get ready for bed, okay?

40:01.942 --> 40:03.608
I didn't do anything
this time.

40:03.675 --> 40:05.142
No one said you did.

40:05.209 --> 40:07.176
Is that phone call
about me?

40:07.242 --> 40:10.308
No, cass.
No, no, it's not about you.

40:10.375 --> 40:11.608
I am glad
that I caught you

40:11.675 --> 40:13.009
before you went to sleep,
though.

40:13.075 --> 40:15.308
Go on, get ready.

40:22.942 --> 40:24.042
Night.

40:24.109 --> 40:25.809
Night.

40:30.408 --> 40:33.009
Shane said
he didn't want you here.

40:35.242 --> 40:36.909
Well, then,
let's not tell him.

40:58.642 --> 40:59.742
Hello?

40:59.809 --> 41:01.276
What the hell's wrong
with you?

41:01.341 --> 41:02.642
<i>What the hell is wrong
with me?</i>

41:02.708 --> 41:03.942
Is Vic there?

41:04.009 --> 41:06.242
You told him to stay away,
didn't you?

41:06.308 --> 41:07.508
I get why Vic lied.

41:07.575 --> 41:09.708
What I don't understand
is why you would.

41:09.775 --> 41:11.176
I didn't lie to you.

41:11.242 --> 41:14.009
All we're trying to do
is get away from him, Corrine.

41:14.075 --> 41:15.575
Don't you comprehend that?

41:15.642 --> 41:18.242
We don't want to see you,
and you don't want to see us,

41:18.308 --> 41:19.742
but that's not enough, is it?

41:19.809 --> 41:21.542
That'll never be enough
for Vic.

41:21.608 --> 41:24.675
We want the same things
that you do, Mara.

41:24.742 --> 41:28.176
Vic tried to kill us tonight,
and you helped him.

41:28.242 --> 41:31.475
He made you an accessory
to attempted murder,

41:31.542 --> 41:34.408
and now you're a criminal
just like Vic.

41:34.475 --> 41:35.608
What do you mean?

41:35.675 --> 41:37.308
He came after us
at the hospital tonight

41:37.375 --> 41:39.909
while I was trying to get
Jackson treated for his fever.

41:39.975 --> 41:42.142
And if those cops didn't show up
when they did,

41:42.209 --> 41:46.075
he would have murdered my entire
family... my unborn child.

41:46.142 --> 41:47.508
I understand.

41:47.575 --> 41:49.875
I hope so, because that's
why Vic turned in his badge.

41:49.942 --> 41:51.975
He's just gonna keep
coming after us

41:52.042 --> 41:53.708
until he gets what he wants,

41:53.775 --> 41:57.142
and the death of my children
will be on your head.

41:57.209 --> 41:59.508
When I call you tomorrow
at 1:00,

41:59.575 --> 42:02.242
you need to have detailed
and specific information

42:02.308 --> 42:04.809
on how and where
the police are looking for us.

42:04.875 --> 42:06.341
You got that?
Yeah.

42:06.408 --> 42:09.075
I'm only asking you again 'cause
I don't have a choice, Corrine.

42:19.276 --> 42:21.075
What did she say?

42:24.809 --> 42:28.475
She said that... that
they don't trust you anymore

42:28.542 --> 42:32.308
and that they're not going
to be calling back here...

42:32.375 --> 42:34.608
ever.

42:42.242 --> 42:44.308
I think I scared her.

42:46.475 --> 42:49.408
I want you to do something
for me.

42:49.475 --> 42:51.109
Sure. What?

42:53.341 --> 42:56.809
You got me here,
and, uh...

42:56.875 --> 43:00.341
and I'll be safe
for a few days.

43:03.842 --> 43:04.975
I want you to go back,

43:05.042 --> 43:06.642
and I want you
to turn yourself in.

43:09.242 --> 43:10.942
No.

43:11.009 --> 43:12.809
L-I don't even want to think
about that now, just listen to me.

43:12.875 --> 43:14.875
Because it's too late. Listen, listen,
listen to me. Listen to me, okay?

43:14.942 --> 43:16.441
They got nothing solid
on you.

43:16.508 --> 43:20.408
You just tell them that I
threatened you into helping me,

43:20.475 --> 43:24.575
and tell them that you were
scared for your life, okay?

43:24.642 --> 43:27.608
They'll believe that.

43:27.675 --> 43:29.775
I won't do it.

43:29.842 --> 43:32.775
Mara, you got to take care
of Jackson...

43:32.842 --> 43:35.009
yourself...

43:35.075 --> 43:37.675
our little baby girl
right in here.

43:39.875 --> 43:41.975
No.

43:42.042 --> 43:44.708
