(narrator) Fairy tales tell,
as their labels imply,

00:25.184 --> 00:29.789
stories of magic, of creatures that fly.

00:29.856 --> 00:33.052
With giants and dragons
and ogres and elves,

00:33.120 --> 00:36.895
and inanimate objects
that speak for themselves.

There's good guys and bad guys
and some guys in between.

01:11.360 --> 01:15.615
A fairy tale also reveals some sort of truth,

01:15.680 --> 01:19.127
the perils of choices we face in our youth.

01:21.792 --> 01:25.370
But our story today is different in theme,

01:25.440 --> 01:29.368

Whoa!

02:21.440 --> 02:23.513
Hello, ladies!

02:23.584 --> 02:25.078
Lucinda!

02:25.152 --> 02:29.821
- She gives the worst gifts.
- Not if she can't find the baby.

Ah!

02:45.536 --> 02:48.503
- Out walking.
- At her grandmother's.

02:48.576 --> 02:50.649
- At her grandmother's.
- Out for a walk.

02:50.720 --> 02:55.957
- She's walking, at her grandmother's.
- Either way, as you see, she's not here.

02:56.512 --> 02:58.781

02:58.847 --> 03:01.662
Oh, look. She's back.

03:03.712 --> 03:05.621
All right.

03:05.696 --> 03:10.268
What shall we give
this beautiful little child today?

03:10.336 --> 03:12.791
- What's her name again?
- Ella.

03:12.864 --> 03:13.812
Ah.

03:13.888 --> 03:16.222
Ella of Frell.

03:18.368 --> 03:21.368
Not a very well-behaved
little stinker, is she?

03:21.952 --> 03:24.505
Quiet, please. l can't concentrate here.

03:25.216 --> 03:29.308
Ella of Frell,
l give you the gift of obedience.

03:31.104 --> 03:33.013
Now, go to sleep.

03:36.287 --> 03:38.327
Now, wake up.

03:42.624 --> 03:46.169
- Isn't it wonderful?
- No, it's terrible.

03:46.239 --> 03:49.818
It's a terrible gift to have to do
what you're told. Take it back.

03:49.888 --> 03:52.059
l have a no-return policy.

03:52.128 --> 03:57.529
And if you're going to be ungrateful, l can
always turn her into a squirrel instead.

03:57.600 --> 04:00.634
- A squirrel?
- No, obedience is a lovely gift.

04:00.704 --> 04:03.486
Besides, you should thank me.

04:03.552 --> 04:08.287
I've just given you the perfect child.

04:13.375 --> 04:17.882
In spite of the spell,
Ella grew up strong of mind.

04:17.952 --> 04:22.840
Her gift made her obedient,
but her heart made her kind.

04:22.912 --> 04:25.017
Why don't you go back
to where you came from?

04:25.088 --> 04:28.569
- Yeah.
- Areida. What a stupid name.

04:29.951 --> 04:32.407
- Nobody wants you here.
- l do.

04:33.312 --> 04:35.384
Bite me.

04:36.864 --> 04:39.166
Did you just see what Ella did?

04:43.936 --> 04:47.766
l made your favorite,
so dig in and stuff your face.

04:47.839 --> 04:49.749
I'm gonna get forks.

04:52.768 --> 04:55.004
Sweetie, stop.

04:57.216 --> 04:59.671
l always knew
something was wrong with me.

04:59.744 --> 05:02.461
Can't you take the spell back?
You're a fairy.

05:02.528 --> 05:04.503
I'm only a household fairy, honey.

05:04.576 --> 05:07.325
Besides, according to fairy guidelines,

05:07.391 --> 05:12.312
only the fairy who gave you the gift
can take it back, and we've begged her.

05:12.384 --> 05:15.548
Not only that, but she said
she'd turn your mother into a squirrel

05:15.616 --> 05:19.358
and take away my eternal youth
if we ever asked her again.

05:19.424 --> 05:21.595
It's not fair.

05:21.664 --> 05:25.373
l know, darling. l know.

05:25.440 --> 05:29.084
So Ella now knew
why she'd always obeyed.

05:29.152 --> 05:32.414
But she never stopped fighting
to have things her way.

05:32.480 --> 05:35.928
Ella! Come practice your mandolin.

05:37.792 --> 05:39.931
Fine, but I'll take
my own sweet time doing it.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.855
Hurry up, now.

05:44.704 --> 05:48.020
As she struggled
to find a way out of her gift,

05:48.096 --> 05:52.885
she had no way of knowing
something worse was adrift.

05:52.959 --> 05:55.228
Please get well, Mother.

05:55.295 --> 05:57.914
Listen to me.

05:57.984 --> 06:02.239
Only Mandy and l know about the gift.

06:02.304 --> 06:05.338
We've never even told your father.

06:06.144 --> 06:09.527
And you must never tell anyone else.

06:10.336 --> 06:14.362
- l don't want anyone using it against you.
- Mother, please.

06:14.431 --> 06:19.930
Remember, no matter
what anyone says or tells you to do,

06:21.184 --> 06:24.151
look to yourself, Ella.

06:24.224 --> 06:29.461
What's inside you
is stronger than any spell.

06:41.600 --> 06:46.750
Take this, then I'll always be with you.

06:57.312 --> 06:59.832

07:00.159 --> 07:01.915

(Mandy) Ella.

07:07.999 --> 07:10.934
Your father would like to speak to you.

07:13.792 --> 07:15.767
- You're married?
- She has money, Ella.

07:15.839 --> 07:18.011
And she's very fond of my title.

07:18.080 --> 07:20.501
It was either get married or sell the house.

07:20.575 --> 07:23.706
You'll adore Dame Olga,
and her two daughters.

07:23.776 --> 07:26.296
She'll make a wonderful mother.

07:26.368 --> 07:28.637
Well, a mother like figure.

07:28.704 --> 07:32.250
Look, I'm sure
you'll all be the best of friends.

07:34.975 --> 07:37.048
Whoa!

07:41.312 --> 07:43.221
ls this the right address?

07:43.296 --> 07:46.460
There must be some mistake.

07:46.528 --> 07:48.437
My dear, welcome.

07:51.199 --> 07:53.468
And these must be your lovely daughters.

07:53.536 --> 07:57.845
My precious Hattie and my special Olive.

07:59.200 --> 08:00.509
Oh.

08:00.576 --> 08:03.674
- And you must be Ella.
- Pleased to meet you.

08:03.744 --> 08:07.573
Yes. The house looks delightful.

08:07.648 --> 08:10.430
But l do seem to remember
that at the noblemen's convention

08:10.495 --> 08:12.699
you said that you lived in a castle.

08:12.767 --> 08:15.669
No, l said a man's home is his castle.

08:15.744 --> 08:19.356
Hi. I'm Ella. Welcome to Frell.

08:21.504 --> 08:23.195
What's with the prince pinups?

08:23.264 --> 08:27.093
Hattie's president
of the Prince Char fan club.

08:28.735 --> 08:32.794
Char and his uncle are responsible
for the segregation of the kingdom.

08:32.864 --> 08:35.613
So? He's dreamy.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.549
ls this hutch meant to be a closet?

08:42.048 --> 08:44.982
It's pathetic.

08:45.055 --> 08:47.925
My clothes need more room than this.

08:50.175 --> 08:52.510
- We'll have to use yours.
- Wha...?

08:52.991 --> 08:55.228
Show it to us.

09:03.455 --> 09:04.884
Oh.

09:04.959 --> 09:08.734
It's so... quaint.

09:10.367 --> 09:13.880
Almost like, well, it's just ugly, isn't it?

09:18.176 --> 09:20.314
There's no room in here, either.

09:20.383 --> 09:24.093
We're gonna have to throw out
some of your gowns to make room.

09:24.159 --> 09:28.054
- Wait. Get away from there!
- You get away.

09:30.720 --> 09:32.629
Oh.

09:32.703 --> 09:36.413
What's this? l do actually like this.

09:36.480 --> 09:38.487
Please don't touch it. It was my mother's.

09:38.559 --> 09:40.468
- Can l have it?
- No.

09:40.543 --> 09:42.682
Oh.

09:42.751 --> 09:45.817
It can be your welcome gift to me.

09:45.887 --> 09:49.084
Come on, hand it over.

09:51.328 --> 09:52.822
Oh.

09:52.896 --> 09:54.805
Aren't you accommodating.

09:54.879 --> 09:56.788
(giggling)

09:57.600 --> 10:01.724
The second l sell the last of these,
I'll be back. l promise.

10:01.792 --> 10:04.607
l know it's not a great job,
not even a good job -

10:04.672 --> 10:09.244
OK, even a monkey could do it -
but we need the money, Ella.

10:10.207 --> 10:13.622
- I'll miss you, Father.
- I'll miss you, too.

10:21.055 --> 10:25.627
(Hattie) Hey, Olive, we should call her
Ella the Smella from Frella.

10:25.696 --> 10:27.387
(giggling)

10:30.111 --> 10:33.592
Elves, giants, ogres and humans
used to exist in harmony,

10:33.664 --> 10:37.787
but when King Florian was killed,
allegedly by an ogre,

10:37.856 --> 10:42.263
Sir Edgar saw it as an opportunity to exile
all nonhuman creatures to the forest,

10:42.335 --> 10:44.724
keeping their land for himself.

10:44.799 --> 10:49.436
Passionately put, Ella.
Give yourself a pat on the back.

10:49.503 --> 10:50.485
(giggling)

10:50.559 --> 10:52.468
(teacher) Hattie?

10:52.543 --> 10:54.453
Oh.

10:58.463 --> 11:02.457
What my unworthy opponent fails to realize

11:02.528 --> 11:07.416
is Sir Edgar has done a fantastic job.

11:07.487 --> 11:09.396
He has driven the ogres out,

11:09.471 --> 11:13.749
and he has put giants and elves to work
as laborers and entertainers.

11:13.823 --> 11:16.278
Therefore, if it weren't for him,

11:16.351 --> 11:19.963
we wouldn't have today's
thriving free-enterprise system.

11:20.031 --> 11:24.309
It's only free because we've enslaved the
poor creatures and they work for nothing.

11:24.383 --> 11:29.882
Edgar is a monster, and l don't hold out
much hope for his nephew, either.

11:29.952 --> 11:33.814
Well, that shows what you know,
aka nothing.

11:34.591 --> 11:37.887
Prince Char will be the greatest king ever.

11:38.943 --> 11:41.464
- Right, girls?
- (all) Yeah.

11:41.536 --> 11:45.911
l wonder if my opponent has based
her opinion on the prince's politics

11:45.984 --> 11:48.984
or how cute she thinks his butt is.

11:51.455 --> 11:54.237
Admit you're stupid
and don't know what you're talking about.

11:54.303 --> 11:57.151
I'm stupid and l don't know
what I'm talking about.

11:57.215 --> 11:59.604
(teacher) Ella?

11:59.679 --> 12:02.134
Anyway, in conclusion...

12:02.207 --> 12:03.996
Hold your tongue, Ella.

12:04.064 --> 12:06.300
(teacher) Ella!

12:08.256 --> 12:10.394
My tongue itches.

12:10.463 --> 12:14.936
(teacher) If you're not going to take this
seriously, l declare Hattie the winner.

12:15.007 --> 12:16.917
(applause)

12:18.112 --> 12:20.021
Ya!

12:28.416 --> 12:31.645
Uncle, do l have to go to this mall opening?

12:31.711 --> 12:35.933
As heir to the throne,
it's your royal responsibility, Char.

12:36.000 --> 12:40.255
- You are a public figure, after all.
- Yes, but you're the one in charge.

12:40.319 --> 12:43.134
Only for a little while longer.

12:43.199 --> 12:45.436
Your coronation is next week.

12:45.504 --> 12:48.438
You need to be out there
with the people, Char.

12:48.511 --> 12:53.661
Yes, shaking hands and kissing babies.

12:53.728 --> 12:58.070
Exactly, Heston.
So the people can learn to trust us.

12:58.143 --> 13:00.052
What's not to trust?

13:00.127 --> 13:02.232
Nothing.

13:02.303 --> 13:07.060
But while you've been away at school,
Char, the kingdom has been under siege.

13:07.135 --> 13:10.812
In your absence,
the ogres have become impossible.

13:10.879 --> 13:17.338
He's right. Even the giants have become
more and more treacherous.

13:18.047 --> 13:20.316
But the giants have always been peaceful.

13:20.383 --> 13:25.686
The ogres were peaceful too,
until they ripped your father to shreds.

13:25.759 --> 13:29.338
And l promised your father,
should anything happen to him,

13:29.408 --> 13:32.953
l would take care of you and the kingdom.

13:33.023 --> 13:38.042
And, well, I've kept my promise, haven't l?

13:38.815 --> 13:40.059
Whoa!

13:40.127 --> 13:43.924
Likewise, you must keep
your promise to the people.

13:43.999 --> 13:49.466
Now, let's put on a smile.
Remember, image is everything.

13:51.519 --> 13:53.908
(d ''Walking On Sunshine'')

13:55.936 --> 13:58.140
(cheering)

14:01.503 --> 14:03.772
Thank you.

14:03.839 --> 14:06.621
Thank you. Thank you.

14:06.687 --> 14:11.160
It's wonderful to be here
in your charming town of... Frell.

14:11.711 --> 14:13.653
Prince Charmont and l...

14:13.727 --> 14:16.542
We want Char! We want Char!

14:16.607 --> 14:20.731
We want Char! We want Char!
We want Char!

14:20.799 --> 14:26.014
Now it is my great pleasure to welcome
my nephew, Prince Charmont.

14:33.055 --> 14:38.238
- Say no to ogrecide!
- Stop the giant land grab!

14:38.303 --> 14:40.889
- Say no to ogrecide!
- Stop the giant land grab!

14:40.959 --> 14:43.544
- Say no to ogrecide!
- Stop the giant land grab!

14:43.615 --> 14:47.893
- Say no to ogrecide!
- Ella! You are embarrassing us!

14:49.375 --> 14:51.547
Go home now.

14:51.616 --> 14:53.885
l have to go. I'm sorry.

14:55.551 --> 14:57.307
l love you, Prince Char!

14:57.376 --> 14:59.285
(screams)

15:00.223 --> 15:02.874
Hey! Prince Char!

15:02.943 --> 15:06.805
- Are you a fast runner?
- Not particularly, no. Why?

15:06.879 --> 15:08.788
Get him!

15:24.575 --> 15:26.779
d And don't it feel good?

15:30.111 --> 15:33.886
- Prince Charmont.
- Please, call me... call me Char.

15:33.951 --> 15:36.188
Sorry about that.
Occupational hazard.

15:36.255 --> 15:39.452
- Allow me.
- l don't need your chivalry, thanks.

15:39.519 --> 15:43.130
And I've no intention of curtsying,
either, so forget it.

15:43.871 --> 15:47.962
You can curtsy or not. That's your choice.
There's really nothing l can do about it.

15:48.031 --> 15:50.649
Except have you beheaded,
but that seems a bit extreme.

15:50.719 --> 15:53.207
Charming. Why don't you do
what your people usually do?

15:53.279 --> 15:56.148
Steal my land and destroy my livelihood.
If you'll excuse me...

15:56.223 --> 15:58.776
Wait a second. Come back here.

16:02.751 --> 16:03.700
Hm?

16:03.775 --> 16:05.979
What is your name?

16:06.047 --> 16:08.316
Ella of Frell.

16:08.383 --> 16:11.001
Well, Ella of Frell,

16:11.071 --> 16:15.544
you're the first maiden I've met
who hasn't swooned at the sight of me.

16:15.615 --> 16:18.484
Then maybe I've done you some good.

16:21.087 --> 16:24.219
Look, I've never stolen
anyone's land or livelihood.

16:24.287 --> 16:28.247
l want peace in the kingdom
as much as anyone.

16:28.319 --> 16:31.931
So you have a new plan
once you take the crown?

16:31.999 --> 16:34.236
Well...

16:34.303 --> 16:38.012
Sort of. Of course,
l couldn't reveal it to a subject.

16:38.079 --> 16:40.282
That's what l thought.
You're all just the same.

16:40.351 --> 16:43.482
You care more about your fan club
and your next jousting tournament.

16:43.551 --> 16:48.373
No, actually, I've never been comfortable
with the whole adoring fan club thing.

16:48.447 --> 16:51.611
Perhaps that's why l find
your obvious disdain for me so refreshing.

16:51.679 --> 16:55.607
Obvious? And l was trying
so hard to hide it.

16:59.743 --> 17:02.460
Where's my purse? It's back there.

17:02.527 --> 17:05.560
Wait right there. l will get it.

17:08.063 --> 17:09.972
(sighs)

17:19.423 --> 17:21.877
Prince Charmont!

17:30.079 --> 17:31.453
Prince Charmont!

17:33.919 --> 17:35.741
Your Highness.

17:40.031 --> 17:43.642
Are you crazy? Why didn't you move?

17:43.711 --> 17:49.374
l would have... were it not for your apparent
fascination with knocking me to the ground.

17:49.439 --> 17:52.221
That's the second time today, you realize.

17:52.287 --> 17:55.484
I'll try and be more considerate
next time I'm saving you.

17:55.551 --> 17:59.348
Next time? What makes you think
we'll see each other again?

17:59.423 --> 18:01.333
Well, won't we?

18:02.431 --> 18:04.340
No.

18:04.767 --> 18:08.444
Ella of Frell, you are not like other girls.

18:10.111 --> 18:12.183
You have no idea.

18:12.255 --> 18:14.644
Ella, come here.

18:21.631 --> 18:25.177
Shouldn't you be at home
cleaning the fireplace, huh?

18:25.247 --> 18:27.613
Stop flirting with him.

18:27.679 --> 18:30.875
It's me he's going to have at his coronation.

18:30.943 --> 18:35.034
Yeah, in the middle of the table
with an apple in your mouth.

18:35.103 --> 18:37.972
Go back to the mall with Olive.

18:41.407 --> 18:43.829
- Ella.
- Oh.

18:43.903 --> 18:46.554
Don't bother with her. Ugh.

18:47.519 --> 18:51.862
I'm the one you want.
l know everything about you.

18:51.935 --> 18:54.585
I've got posters of you, and pictures.

18:54.655 --> 18:57.110
And when we used to live in Lamia,

18:57.183 --> 19:03.478
l used to stand outside your castle and
watch you turn your lights on and off.

19:05.855 --> 19:08.244
Tell Ella I'll be in touch.

19:12.127 --> 19:14.549
Right. I'll see to that.

19:14.623 --> 19:16.892
- Where were you?
- Oh.

19:16.959 --> 19:19.130
- l met the prince.
- You met the prince?

19:19.199 --> 19:21.752
l don't wanna talk about it.
Olive and Hattie were there.

19:21.823 --> 19:24.474
Hattie. Why do you always do
what Hattie tells you to do?

19:24.543 --> 19:26.485
- l don't.
- Yes, you do.

19:26.559 --> 19:28.730
- l don't.
- Tell the truth.

19:28.799 --> 19:30.261
Oh, l do.

19:30.335 --> 19:33.782
Olive, have you noticed
anything strange about Ella?

19:33.855 --> 19:36.157
No, not really.

19:36.223 --> 19:41.013
Have you noticed it gets darker at night,
then lighter when the sun comes up?

19:41.086 --> 19:43.836
- That's because of Ella?
- Never mind.

19:43.903 --> 19:46.805
- You've been acting odd, even for you.
- What do you mean?

19:46.879 --> 19:49.978
- Oh... Don't let her see me.
- That's what l mean.

19:50.047 --> 19:51.508
Aha.

19:51.583 --> 19:55.860
- Areida, no!
- Ella, come here.

19:55.935 --> 19:57.845
l have to go.

20:01.502 --> 20:04.950
- What?
- l need you to do me a little favor.

20:05.023 --> 20:06.747
Take that.

20:08.799 --> 20:12.061
Cool! Let me try! Take that.

20:13.022 --> 20:15.673
And that potion bottle.

20:15.743 --> 20:17.783
OK! OK, that's enough.

20:17.855 --> 20:23.158
l think that's for me to say, Ella.
We need one more thing.

20:23.231 --> 20:25.140
Take those.

20:28.830 --> 20:33.238
- Please don't make me do this.
- Well, since you said please...

20:33.311 --> 20:36.857
No. Take them. Take them!

20:38.719 --> 20:40.541
Run!

20:40.606 --> 20:43.356
Stop that girl!

20:43.423 --> 20:46.871
Buy a squirrel sandwich.
Get 'em while they're hot.

20:46.943 --> 20:48.983
Here. Keep the change.

20:49.055 --> 20:50.964
Excuse me.

20:56.222 --> 20:58.557
Excuse me. Coming through.

20:58.623 --> 21:01.492
Try our new perfume.

21:01.567 --> 21:03.574
Thanks.

21:05.375 --> 21:08.157
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

21:17.023 --> 21:18.746
Ella, bravo!

21:22.207 --> 21:24.116
Freeze!

21:33.119 --> 21:35.257
Put your hands together.

21:36.927 --> 21:39.163
You're under arrest.

21:42.046 --> 21:46.236
A felon in my own family.
l could die from embarrassment.

21:46.303 --> 21:48.441
Promises, promises.

21:49.407 --> 21:52.571
- You are a disgrace.
- Maybe she was put up to it.

21:55.679 --> 21:59.869
Mandy's right, Mother. We were there.

21:59.934 --> 22:02.618
It really wasn't poor Ella's fault at all.

22:02.687 --> 22:04.727
She was forced to do it.

22:05.631 --> 22:09.014
So, Ella, who put you up to it?

22:09.086 --> 22:11.705
- (whispers) Tell her it was Areida.
- Ar...

22:11.775 --> 22:15.768
I'm waiting. Tell me who's to blame.

22:17.791 --> 22:19.514
Areida.

22:19.583 --> 22:22.453
Areida! l might have guessed it.

22:23.423 --> 22:27.285
- You are forbidden ever to see her again.
- What?

22:27.359 --> 22:28.668
(Areida) Ella?

22:28.734 --> 22:31.036
How dare she come here now?

22:31.103 --> 22:35.380
Answer the door and tell her
that you never want to see her again.

22:35.454 --> 22:38.771
And tell her you could never be friends
with an Ayorthian.

22:38.846 --> 22:41.661
- Dame Olga, there must be some mistake.
- Please, Dame Olga.

22:41.726 --> 22:44.443
Don't argue. Just do it.

22:49.439 --> 22:52.025
Thank goodness you're all right.

22:55.262 --> 22:57.270
What's wrong?

23:00.959 --> 23:04.058
l never wanna see you again.

23:06.015 --> 23:08.022
Ha-ha. Very funny.

23:12.990 --> 23:15.860
l don't understand.
We're best friends.

23:22.431 --> 23:26.871
l could never be friends with an Ayorthian.

23:30.655 --> 23:32.727
Just go.

23:40.607 --> 23:42.811
I've done terrible things before, Mandy,

23:42.879 --> 23:47.286
but this is the worst thing
the curse has ever made me do.

23:50.334 --> 23:52.855
I've gotta do it.

23:52.927 --> 23:57.782
l have got to find Lucinda
and get her to take back the curse.

23:59.998 --> 24:01.908
You're right.

24:03.487 --> 24:05.690
l have something to show you.

24:05.758 --> 24:08.661
This is gonna help you find her.

24:09.278 --> 24:11.896
l should have told you
about this years ago.

24:11.966 --> 24:14.814
- But l was a little embarrassed.
- Embarrassed? How?

24:14.879 --> 24:19.767
Well, as you know,
I'm not the most talented fairy.

24:20.671 --> 24:26.715
Anyway, this book...
is my boyfriend, Benny.

24:27.326 --> 24:28.635
Hey.

24:28.703 --> 24:32.150
Pleased to meet you.
Pleased to meet anyone, quite frankly.

24:32.222 --> 24:36.084
You're the first introduction
I've had in 20 years.

24:36.158 --> 24:39.387
- I've never seen anything like this.
- l know. No one has.

24:39.454 --> 24:43.131
And l don't want them to,
cos then they might take him away.

24:43.198 --> 24:49.560
It was an accident. l was just trying a spell
to trim his hair, and it went a little askew.

24:49.631 --> 24:52.664
l would have left her ages ago,
except l love her so darn much.

24:52.734 --> 24:54.971
Plus, l have no legs.

24:55.039 --> 24:57.428
l love you, too, my little Pooky Pages.

24:57.503 --> 24:59.608
Not as much as l love you, Cuddlebuns.

24:59.679 --> 25:02.166
- l love you more.
- OK.

25:02.238 --> 25:04.856
Lots of love. Moving on.

25:05.343 --> 25:08.092
Well, l want you to take him with you.

25:08.158 --> 25:11.507
You mean I'm getting out of here?
Beyond these four walls?

25:11.582 --> 25:15.444
There are so many places in my pages
I've been wanting to visit.

25:15.518 --> 25:18.071
Wow. What is all this?

25:18.143 --> 25:21.274
- He knows everything.
- Thanks, sweetie, but not everything.

25:21.342 --> 25:23.611
If l did, I'd be a lot thicker.

25:23.679 --> 25:25.588
Can he show me anything about Lucinda?

25:25.663 --> 25:30.169
- Can l show you anything about Lucinda?
- Watch this.

25:30.238 --> 25:32.180
Show me Lucinda.

25:32.254 --> 25:34.010
Ta-da!

25:34.078 --> 25:36.664
Cool trick.

25:37.150 --> 25:40.085
Now, which Crockery Barn?
They're all over the kingdom.

25:40.159 --> 25:41.086
Ah.

25:41.150 --> 25:45.045
That's the glitch. He can't tell you where
a person is. He can just show you pictures.

25:45.119 --> 25:48.218
Like a crystal ball or a magic mirror.

25:48.287 --> 25:51.898
Everything is so huge.
ls that a wedding registry?

25:52.703 --> 25:55.485
Duh! They're in Giantville.

25:56.383 --> 25:59.198
Look, she's going
to a wedding in Giantville.

25:59.263 --> 26:02.972
- Benny, we're going to Giantville.
- How exciting.

26:03.039 --> 26:06.933
( Olga) Ella, the girls and l need bouquets
for our portrait sitting tomorrow.

26:07.006 --> 26:08.916
Go and pick some.

26:17.022 --> 26:20.284
♪ What you want, baby, I got it

26:21.022 --> 26:24.219

26:34.558 --> 26:36.468
Oh, my God!

26:37.919 --> 26:42.708
So, as her step family scratched
their newly found itches,

26:42.782 --> 26:46.808
Ella was off, glad to be rid of the... witches.

26:48.383 --> 26:50.619
Benny, can you show me a map
of the Forest of Pim?

26:50.687 --> 26:52.596
Of course.

26:54.175 --> 26:56.444
Whoa.

26:57.598 --> 27:01.624
According to this map,
if we head due east towards Monster Rock,

27:01.694 --> 27:03.636
we can cut half a day off our journey.

27:03.710 --> 27:05.019
(yelp)

27:05.086 --> 27:07.737
- What was that?
- Probably something that wants to eat us.

27:07.806 --> 27:09.629
Ouch!

27:09.695 --> 27:11.833
- (man) Somebody help me!
- (man laughs)

27:11.902 --> 27:15.383
- Wait a minute.
- (man) Sing soprano, little man!

27:18.398 --> 27:19.445
Missed!

27:19.518 --> 27:22.584
What do you think
you're doing to that poor elf?

27:22.654 --> 27:23.701
Oh.

27:23.774 --> 27:26.622
Who's this who thinks she's so tough?

27:28.639 --> 27:34.519
Look, l think it's only fair to warn you that
I'm practiced in the ancient art... of origami.

27:36.542 --> 27:38.451
Paper folding?

27:38.526 --> 27:40.948
l was hoping
you wouldn't know what that was.

27:41.023 --> 27:44.187
Don't let him scare you, sweetheart!
Kick his butt!

27:45.375 --> 27:47.764
Don't let her do that.

27:47.839 --> 27:50.205
Now rabbit punch.

27:51.774 --> 27:56.117
Combo. Kneel. Front-step kick.
Dragon-roundhouse kick.

27:59.390 --> 28:01.757
Let's get outta here.

28:01.822 --> 28:04.211

28:05.566 --> 28:07.705
Let me help you with that.

28:07.774 --> 28:10.905
l am gonna need
so much therapy after this.

28:11.774 --> 28:12.636
Oh!

28:12.703 --> 28:15.769
- Are you OK?
- No, l am not OK!

28:15.839 --> 28:18.872
l think l broke something,
or dislocated it, or...

28:18.942 --> 28:19.836
(crunch)

28:19.902 --> 28:22.869

28:24.223 --> 28:26.940
Ella of Frell. Nice to meet you.

28:29.822 --> 28:34.907
Well, if you're OK,
then l have to be going, but good luck.

28:34.974 --> 28:39.579
You're going? You can't walk in this wood
on your own. How about a bite to eat?

28:39.646 --> 28:42.199
That's very sweet,
but I'm on a tight schedule.

28:42.270 --> 28:45.750
Fine. Message received,

30:10.750 --> 30:12.659
(waitress) l need this.

30:12.734 --> 30:16.247
What is this, anyway? Ella's secret diary.

30:17.663 --> 30:20.794
Yes. Why don't you like music?

30:20.862 --> 30:26.132
That's right. Because elves are supposed
to be so happy and joyful all the time.

30:26.206 --> 30:28.857
Singing and dancing for the man.

30:28.927 --> 30:31.032
l don't wanna be an entertainer.

30:31.103 --> 30:33.143
l wanna be a...

30:33.214 --> 30:34.807
- What?
- Nothing.

30:34.878 --> 30:36.634
- What were you gonna say?
- It's silly.

30:36.703 --> 30:38.939
Please tell me.

30:39.006 --> 30:41.559
l wanna be a lawyer.

30:42.334 --> 30:44.701
- l guess in small-claims court.
- What is that?

30:44.766 --> 30:46.676
Nothing.

30:46.750 --> 30:49.784
- Why can't you be a lawyer?
- Hello?

30:49.854 --> 30:52.309
Elf.

30:52.382 --> 30:56.343
l forgot. The elfin restrictions
Sir Edgar passed.

30:56.415 --> 31:00.790
No elf shall be engaged in any occupation
other than singing, juggling

31:00.863 --> 31:03.580
and / or tomfoolery.

31:03.646 --> 31:06.067
They're never gonna let me
go to law school.

31:06.142 --> 31:08.346
I'm never gonna get my day in court,

31:08.414 --> 31:10.651
never gonna stand
in front of the judge and say

31:10.718 --> 31:14.034
''You're out of order!
Permission to approach the bench?''

31:14.110 --> 31:16.052
- ''l object!''
- No, l object.

31:16.126 --> 31:19.541
- l heard it there. It's coming from the book.
- No, it's not.

31:19.614 --> 31:21.654
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

31:22.558 --> 31:26.104
Great. l knew it. A talking book.

31:26.175 --> 31:30.909
Good. Because for a minute there,
l thought l was going crazy.

31:30.975 --> 31:31.989
♪ Crazy

31:32.062 --> 31:35.892
♪ I'm crazy for feeling so lonely

31:42.239 --> 31:45.500
- What are you doing with Ella's things?
- Just a little tidying up.

31:45.566 --> 31:49.047
- What's that?
- What? Nothing. It's personal.

31:53.055 --> 31:55.989
A letter for Ella?

31:56.062 --> 32:01.463
The prince's coronation ball.
He's invited that insolent little snip?

32:01.534 --> 32:05.331
Girls, go and dust off your ball gowns
and pack your bags.

32:05.406 --> 32:10.491
l think l may have found you
another chance at your future husband.

32:13.918 --> 32:16.635
Yes!

32:23.518 --> 32:26.169
So you can really show me anything
anywhere in the kingdom?

32:26.238 --> 32:30.908
You're kind of like a walking, talking
encyclopedia, except for the walking part.

32:30.974 --> 32:32.883
- Come on.
- What?

32:33.662 --> 32:35.572
What's going on?

32:35.646 --> 32:39.924
Edgar's soldiers rounding up elfin singers
to perform at the coronation.

32:39.998 --> 32:43.162
Get in. And you.

32:45.118 --> 32:47.900
Slannen, you've gotta go to Lamia
and petition the prince.

32:47.966 --> 32:50.748
- For what?
- To go to law school. You gotta stop this.

32:50.814 --> 32:54.905
♪ The sun will shine

32:54.974 --> 32:57.789
(Slannen) You want me to go
to Lamia on my own?

32:57.854 --> 33:00.669
We're going to Giantville.
It's on the way. Come with us.

33:00.734 --> 33:04.378
The prince will never grant an audience
with an elf. They think we're a joke.

33:04.446 --> 33:09.684
l have met Prince Charmont, and l think
he might be different than his uncle.

33:09.758 --> 33:13.369
- Why? Cos he's a hunk?
- No.

33:13.438 --> 33:15.413
- What is he, about six foot?
- About.

33:15.486 --> 33:18.934
Yeah, l hate the guy already.
I'm not wasting my time.

33:19.006 --> 33:22.104
Lacking courage as well as height.

33:25.918 --> 33:29.464
Count me in.
Elves aren't that short, you know.

33:30.014 --> 33:33.527
That's just a myth created by that stupid
Elves and the Shoemaker story.

33:33.598 --> 33:36.315
- Do l look small enough to fit in a shoe?
- No.

33:36.382 --> 33:39.678
Stinking Grimm Brothers.
Are you sure he knows where he's going?

33:39.742 --> 33:42.906
Hey, I'm right here. Just cos I'm a book
doesn't mean l don't have ears.

33:42.974 --> 33:47.130
Boys, if you can't play nice,
you can't play together.

33:47.646 --> 33:49.173
(rustling)

33:49.246 --> 33:54.068
Oh, no. The rustling always comes
before the screaming and the running.

33:54.142 --> 33:55.898
l knew this was gonna happen.

33:55.966 --> 34:00.221
They'll just find pieces of us
scattered across the forest floor.

34:00.286 --> 34:06.036
Oh, a bunny. You know, the last known
case of a bunny attack was, well, never.

34:07.486 --> 34:10.356
It never hurts to be on your guard.

34:11.550 --> 34:12.760
(twig snaps)

34:12.830 --> 34:15.960
Nobody panic, nobody panic.
I've got this in hand.

34:16.030 --> 34:17.110
Oi!

34:17.181 --> 34:19.418
You! Thumper!

34:19.485 --> 34:22.649
Out of the forest or no more carrots for you.

34:25.661 --> 34:28.246
l don't like carrots.

34:29.310 --> 34:32.757
How do you feel about rabbits,
cos one just went thataway.

34:32.830 --> 34:35.862
l am the ogre, Nish.

34:35.934 --> 34:41.170
How do you like to be eaten?
Baked, boiled, shish-kebabbed?

34:41.246 --> 34:43.734
How about free range?

34:45.469 --> 34:47.226
Stop! No!

34:47.293 --> 34:50.458
Ella of Frell. Hi, how are you doing?

34:50.525 --> 34:55.195
l think there's been a big mistake here.
See, I'm pro-ogre.

34:55.262 --> 34:56.690
Pro-ogre?

34:56.766 --> 35:00.541
Absolutely. l led a rally on your behalf
the other day. Maybe you heard about it.

35:00.606 --> 35:05.211
It'll only hurt for a moment, l promise.
I'm a fast eater.

35:07.102 --> 35:10.418
Slannen, Slannen!
Please, l want to help.

35:10.494 --> 35:12.982
Help? From a human?

35:13.694 --> 35:16.182
Humans took everything from us.

35:16.254 --> 35:19.996
l was an ogre of leisure, with a simple life.

35:20.062 --> 35:23.096
- Next thing you know...
- Now, not this again.

35:23.166 --> 35:27.192
Nish, hurry up. I'm starving.

35:27.262 --> 35:29.847
Right, you, into the pot.

35:32.510 --> 35:35.444
Forget that.

35:37.118 --> 35:40.020
- Who are you?
- l am the ogre, Nish.

35:40.926 --> 35:44.243
We just did this. Didn't we just do this?

35:44.317 --> 35:47.285
All right, that's enough fun and games.

35:47.358 --> 35:50.489
Now, keep your mouth shut
and don't move.

35:55.742 --> 35:57.498
ls it boiling yet?

35:57.566 --> 35:59.900
It's not gonna boil
if you stand there looking at it.

35:59.966 --> 36:02.683
You couldn't show a picture
of a big ogre heading our way?

36:02.750 --> 36:05.336
- That would have been helpful.
- Oh! Oh!

36:05.406 --> 36:07.610
l think l see bubbles.

36:10.270 --> 36:12.179
(horse neighs)

36:14.333 --> 36:16.700
Let her go!

36:29.854 --> 36:32.571
Untie yourself.

37:06.622 --> 37:09.044
Truce! Truce!

37:09.118 --> 37:11.158
Can't we just get along?

37:12.574 --> 37:15.160
Are you one of the monsters
who killed my father?

37:15.230 --> 37:18.743
King Florian was a good man.
We lived in peace during his reign.

37:18.814 --> 37:21.050
Why would we kill him?

37:25.886 --> 37:28.603
I'll spare your lives
where you didn't spare his.

37:28.670 --> 37:32.444
You take your friends
and find breakfast elsewhere.

37:32.510 --> 37:34.877
We'll pick up something else on the way.

37:34.942 --> 37:38.968
Anyway, you eat maiden,
an hour later you're hungry again.

37:44.798 --> 37:47.896
What are you doing here,
with an elf for protection?

37:47.966 --> 37:50.267
Do you get a kick
out of near-death experiences?

37:50.333 --> 37:53.629
No. l was fine. l had things well in hand.

37:53.694 --> 37:56.760
l could see that, as you were dangling
over the boiling cauldron,

37:56.830 --> 37:59.732
no doubt lulling the ogres
into a false sense of security.

37:59.806 --> 38:03.384
Who's to say it wouldn't have worked
if you hadn't come barging in?

38:03.454 --> 38:07.447
l see the score currently stands
at chivalry two, gratitude zero.

38:07.517 --> 38:09.427
Look...

38:11.134 --> 38:13.949
You're right. I'm sorry.

38:14.014 --> 38:17.210
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

38:17.278 --> 38:19.449
- You're bleeding.
- Hm?

38:19.518 --> 38:21.460
Oh, it's just a scratch.

38:21.534 --> 38:24.567
You'd better let me help you with that.

38:30.942 --> 38:35.001
- So, will l live?
- l think the odds are in your favor.

38:35.902 --> 38:38.717
So... where were you headed?

38:38.782 --> 38:42.044
The giants' village for a wedding.
I'm meeting my godmother.

38:42.110 --> 38:44.663
That's on our way back to Lamia.
We'll accompany you.

38:44.734 --> 38:46.327
That's not necessary.

38:46.398 --> 38:50.904
It makes it so much easier rescuing you
if l don't have to commute.

38:50.973 --> 38:57.881
I'm so glad l was here
for this interesting development.

38:57.950 --> 38:58.898
(Heston groans)

38:58.974 --> 39:03.098
- Look, l really appreciate the offer, but...
- Are you crazy? Tell him to come with us.

39:03.166 --> 39:05.075
Come with us.

39:13.278 --> 39:17.882
So, traveling with an elf?
Your boyfriend couldn't make it?

39:17.949 --> 39:19.608
- No.
- Oh.

39:19.678 --> 39:22.067
- Because l don't have one.
- Oh.

39:23.838 --> 39:26.456
Your girlfriend doesn't mind
being left alone?

39:26.526 --> 39:28.665
- l don't have a girlfriend.
- Oh?

39:28.734 --> 39:32.346
- l have many.
- Oh.

39:34.781 --> 39:39.157
I'm kidding. Shouldn't believe
everything you read in Medieval Teen.

39:39.230 --> 39:42.578
Excuse me. Excuse me.

39:42.653 --> 39:45.403
Prince Charmont, permission to speak?

39:46.430 --> 39:49.245
- Sure.
- You know the word coincidence?

39:49.310 --> 39:53.020
It just so happens l was on my way
to meet a certain royal someone

39:53.086 --> 39:57.014
in order to discuss some career options
currently unavailable to...

39:57.086 --> 40:01.363
Slannen wants to petition the kingdom
for the right to become a lawyer.

40:01.438 --> 40:03.194
- A lawyer?
- Why not?

40:03.262 --> 40:07.059
There were no laws against it
when your father was king.

40:07.134 --> 40:10.068
That's not really my area of expertise.

40:10.141 --> 40:13.207
My advice to you
would be to talk to my uncle.

40:13.277 --> 40:15.896
I'm sure if you make a good argument,
he'll come round.

40:15.966 --> 40:20.341
Well, thank you for your... advice.

40:27.421 --> 40:30.717
- What?
- You're about to become king.

40:30.782 --> 40:35.932
You'll have the power to make a difference
in the world and you don't even care.

40:35.998 --> 40:40.154
It's not like l asked to become king.
I've had no say in the matter.

40:40.222 --> 40:43.931
Well, thanks to your uncle, there are a lot
of people who have no say in the matter.

40:43.997 --> 40:46.932
Nobody should be forced to do things
they don't wanna do.

40:47.006 --> 40:49.559
Take it from somebody who knows.

40:51.198 --> 40:54.132
Ella! Ella!

41:09.790 --> 41:13.652
You're not finished yet.
You work until sundown.

41:16.862 --> 41:21.052
( Char) The giants have always been
gentle. Why are they treated like slaves?

41:21.118 --> 41:23.835
I'm sure my uncle doesn't know about this.

41:23.902 --> 41:25.811
He couldn't.

41:32.894 --> 41:35.676
(lively music)

41:35.741 --> 41:38.491
(Ella) Maybe you can get
to the bottom of this at the wedding.

41:38.557 --> 41:41.339
( Char) Maybe you can find
your godmother.

42:10.174 --> 42:11.962
(Ella) Whoa.

42:13.214 --> 42:17.338
They're not so bad.
l thought they'd be all so big and scary.

42:20.318 --> 42:21.594
Didn't hurt.

42:21.661 --> 42:24.531
l hope this is a good idea.
They must hate the royal family.

42:24.605 --> 42:27.093
They'll respect your courage
at showing up here.

42:27.165 --> 42:31.540
Besides, they don't hold grudges.
They're bigger than that.

42:31.613 --> 42:34.548
Prince Charmont.
What are you doing here?

42:34.622 --> 42:36.923
No grudges, eh?

42:36.989 --> 42:41.779
Well, l thought that maybe this would be a
good time to possibly have a heart-to-heart.

42:41.854 --> 42:46.971
But now I'm thinking l should come back
when there's been a little less drinking.

42:47.037 --> 42:50.867
He's here as a friend
to hear your complaints.

42:50.942 --> 42:53.211
Then welcome.

42:53.278 --> 42:56.627
I'm looking for someone.
My godmother, Lucinda.

42:56.702 --> 42:58.611
She was over there earlier.

43:02.909 --> 43:05.779
Thank you. I'll be right back.

43:11.710 --> 43:15.321
Excuse me. ls Lucinda Perriweather here?

43:15.389 --> 43:19.448
Too late, sweetheart.
She left about an hour ago.

43:19.517 --> 43:22.070
Do you know where l can find her?

43:22.141 --> 43:25.457
Last l heard,
she was somewhere living in Lamia.

43:25.533 --> 43:28.119
Do you know where the bathroom is?

43:30.622 --> 43:33.175
Benny, show me Lucinda.

43:34.109 --> 43:36.345
Looks like she's getting an FWl.

43:36.414 --> 43:40.058
- FWl?
- Flying while intoxicated.

43:41.789 --> 43:44.058
- She could be anywhere.
- Ow!

43:44.125 --> 43:46.459
Sorry.

43:54.366 --> 43:56.275
Agh!

44:01.342 --> 44:02.902
Ooh.

44:02.973 --> 44:05.428
I'd no idea things were so bad.

44:05.501 --> 44:09.047
l promise, first thing after my coronation,
I'll help you buy your farms back.

44:09.118 --> 44:11.125
I'll hold you to that.

44:11.197 --> 44:13.619
- I'm sorry to interrupt.
- No problem. We were done.

44:13.693 --> 44:16.082
That's a fine young man you have here.

44:16.509 --> 44:20.087
He's not fine. l mean, mine. He is fine...

44:21.854 --> 44:23.348
Never mind.

44:23.422 --> 44:26.204
So have you seen Slannen?
We have to leave.

44:26.269 --> 44:29.269
My godmother's on some kind of bender.

44:29.341 --> 44:31.643
You can't leave now.
It's the middle of the night.

44:31.709 --> 44:34.905
You have to stay for the party.

44:34.973 --> 44:37.210
OK, I'll stay.

44:38.429 --> 44:42.488
l appreciate your enthusiasm,
but you don't have to stay.

44:42.558 --> 44:46.616
l don't wanna make you do
anything you don't wanna do.

44:47.549 --> 44:50.778
Thank you, Char. For everything.

44:50.846 --> 44:52.755
So I'll see you around?

44:58.013 --> 45:00.402
But l wish you would stay.

45:04.446 --> 45:07.315
l guess one more night wouldn't hurt.

45:08.542 --> 45:11.509
Mmm. Yuck.

45:14.525 --> 45:17.340
So you're looking
for your godmother Lucinda?

45:17.405 --> 45:21.267
She was supposed to be here,
and now l have no idea where she is,

45:21.341 --> 45:24.985
and l need to find her
as soon as possible bec...

45:25.918 --> 45:28.765
Because l miss her.

45:29.789 --> 45:31.699
OK.

45:32.317 --> 45:35.383
- Did you think of trying the hall of records?
- No.

45:35.453 --> 45:38.802
We have every year's census in the castle.

45:38.877 --> 45:43.449
It's not open to everyone,
but l could probably pull a few strings.

45:43.517 --> 45:46.583
Char, l can't tell you
what that would mean to me.

45:46.653 --> 45:50.002
Well, then, it's settled.
You come with me to Lamia tomorrow.

45:50.077 --> 45:51.670
OK.

45:52.989 --> 45:54.745
- l gotta hide. They're after me.
- Who?

45:54.814 --> 45:57.628
The giants.
They want me to sing. l don't sing!

45:57.694 --> 46:01.687
There he is. There's our little entertainer.

46:03.006 --> 46:08.985
Mr Koopooduk, l know you may find this
hard to believe, but Slannen doesn't sing.

46:09.053 --> 46:12.883
- Well, how about you, then?
- Me? Oh, no. l couldn't.

46:12.958 --> 46:16.089
- Now, come on.
- Please don't.

46:16.157 --> 46:18.262
Sing.

49:49.565 --> 49:51.671
Really?

49:51.742 --> 49:56.378
Because, you know,
being an elf, l love to sing.

49:56.445 --> 49:59.095
You know, l hope
you don't mind me saying this,

49:59.165 --> 50:03.955
but you're much prettier
than l would have expected.

50:04.029 --> 50:08.306
Oh, l know. Giants are supposed
to be big, ugly and mean.

50:08.381 --> 50:11.512
It's because of stories
like Jack and the Beanstalk.

50:11.581 --> 50:13.970
Stinking Grimm Brothers.

50:16.861 --> 50:19.610
I've seen weirder couples.

50:19.677 --> 50:23.606
None that immediately come to mind,
but still.

50:23.677 --> 50:27.354
My stepsister Hattie would die
if she knew l was here.

50:27.421 --> 50:29.690
She's the president
of your fan club, you know.

50:29.757 --> 50:32.823
Oh, Hattie, yes. Thank you.

50:32.893 --> 50:37.399
Now l know what name
to put on the restraining order.

50:37.469 --> 50:41.560
No, you're lucky.
l wish l had brothers and sisters.

50:42.429 --> 50:45.560
My mother passed away
before she had any more children and...

50:45.629 --> 50:48.018
My mother passed away, too.

50:50.365 --> 50:52.274
Oh.

50:52.989 --> 50:56.633
You know, she used to sing me
to sleep every night.

50:56.701 --> 51:02.397
My father used to sing to me,
loudly and very off-key, but...

51:02.461 --> 51:04.371
l still miss him.

51:04.445 --> 51:06.485
l have Edgar, l guess.

51:06.557 --> 51:10.518
He's not such a bad guy.
He risked his life to save my father.

51:10.589 --> 51:13.622
And he brought me up as his own son.

51:13.693 --> 51:15.865
l know you don't like his politics much,

51:15.933 --> 51:20.755
but I'm sure when l tell him about
the giants, he will correct the situation.

51:20.829 --> 51:23.479
Yeah, or you could.

51:23.548 --> 51:27.891
It took a lot of guts for you to come here.
Look at the way you smoothed things over.

51:27.965 --> 51:30.201
You're a natural at this.

51:31.389 --> 51:34.138
Wow, is that almost a compliment?

51:35.357 --> 51:40.594
Almost. Now, don't go getting a big head.
Your crown won't fit.

51:40.669 --> 51:43.571
You know what else?
Tomorrow I'm gonna go to my uncle

51:43.645 --> 51:46.547
and I'm gonna ask him
to repeal the elfin restrictions.

51:46.621 --> 51:51.258
Slannen will have his day in court,
if l have anything to say about it.

52:00.797 --> 52:04.823
l think you're gonna be
a great king someday.

52:04.893 --> 52:07.380
Your father would have been proud.

52:08.893 --> 52:11.129
Thanks.

52:14.237 --> 52:17.335
l think he would have really liked you.

52:24.701 --> 52:26.937
Kiss me.

52:33.085 --> 52:36.085
That wasn't an order, you know.

52:39.357 --> 52:41.593
l know.

53:17.021 --> 53:21.047
l want to look 25 at tonight's ball.
What do you suggest?

53:21.117 --> 53:23.059
A time machine?

53:23.133 --> 53:26.068
May l recommend our newest procedure?

53:27.005 --> 53:30.103
Bat faeces and oxen blood.

53:31.261 --> 53:33.170
Batox.

53:34.237 --> 53:37.270
Works wonders, although l do caution you,

53:37.341 --> 53:39.862
some people have
a temporarily bad reaction.

53:39.933 --> 53:43.228
- Olga.
- Peter, what are you doing here?

53:43.293 --> 53:47.352
I'm in town on business and heard
you were here. l came to see Ella.

53:47.421 --> 53:50.268
- ls Ella here?
- Of course. Where else would she be?

53:50.332 --> 53:55.700
She's... she's... with Hattie and Olive,
taking a tour of the castle.

54:00.988 --> 54:04.185
Next we move into the castle lobby.

54:04.253 --> 54:06.325
l can't believe it.

54:06.396 --> 54:09.625
Prince Char walked on this actual floor!

54:10.621 --> 54:13.436
Ladies, ladies, ladies!

54:13.501 --> 54:15.388
Stop tonguing the foyer.

54:15.453 --> 54:17.395
(all groan)

54:17.468 --> 54:20.981
- Show us where Char showers.
- (excited giggling)

54:21.052 --> 54:23.867
l bet he showers naked!

54:34.365 --> 54:37.496
- Hold it, pipsqueak.
- I'm with the prince. And I'm not that short.

54:37.565 --> 54:40.249
- Are you singing at the coronation?
- Heck, no.

54:40.317 --> 54:42.967
No elves in the palace
unless they're performing.

54:43.036 --> 54:45.425
Discrimination. intentional infliction of...

54:45.501 --> 54:47.476
Whoa!

54:49.981 --> 54:51.890
..bodily harm.

54:51.965 --> 54:55.577
These portraits
were recently commissioned

54:55.645 --> 54:59.125
in honor of tomorrow's coronation.

54:59.196 --> 55:00.985
(women gasp)

55:01.821 --> 55:03.861
(women scream)

55:08.700 --> 55:11.384
Right, follow me.

55:11.453 --> 55:13.362
What are they doing here?

55:13.437 --> 55:17.267
l don't mean to rush, but now l really need
to find my godmother, and Slannen, too.

55:17.340 --> 55:20.472
- Where is he?
- My uncle'll send the guards to find him.

55:20.541 --> 55:24.567
Everything's gonna be fine.
Don't forget, you are with the future king.

55:24.637 --> 55:27.222
- Char.
- Hello, Uncle.

55:28.381 --> 55:30.585
I've been looking all over for you.

55:30.653 --> 55:34.482
And who might
this charming young lady be?

55:34.557 --> 55:38.419
This is Ella. Ella of Frell.

55:38.493 --> 55:40.598
Ella, this is my Uncle Edgar.

55:41.501 --> 55:45.973
And this is his... Heston.

55:46.365 --> 55:48.274
Hey.

55:49.245 --> 55:52.441
So, l trust your journey was pleasant?

55:52.508 --> 55:55.956
We had a little run-in with some ogres,
but Char got the best of them.

55:56.029 --> 55:58.484
You could have been killed.

55:58.557 --> 56:03.958
Ah, well. One just has to grin and bear it,
l always say. Grin and bear it.

56:06.589 --> 56:09.884
So, Char, might l trouble you
for a moment?

56:09.949 --> 56:13.494
The crown maker needs to see you
in your chambers for a fitting.

56:13.565 --> 56:19.446
Sure. l just have to take Ella to the...
to the hall of records.

56:20.188 --> 56:23.450
Yes, well, hop to it, then, both of you.

56:32.316 --> 56:36.113
You were right about that girl. Very odd.

56:36.189 --> 56:39.123
And I'm afraid she's been
filling our prince's head

56:39.196 --> 56:42.328
with dangerous new thoughts.

56:43.740 --> 56:48.562
Here's the latest census. Names are listed
first by location then species.

56:48.636 --> 56:50.425
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

56:50.493 --> 56:53.526
Sorry l couldn't be of more help,
but l don't have a census.

56:53.596 --> 56:58.037
l mean, look at the size of that thing.
l do have a restaurant guide.

56:58.109 --> 57:00.826
Lucinda, l hope you're in here.

57:10.237 --> 57:14.808
Ella has lots of interesting opinions about
the kingdom, Uncle. You should hear them.

57:14.876 --> 57:16.632
l can't wait.

57:16.701 --> 57:20.857
The giants' working conditions,
for instance. They're unbelievable.

57:20.924 --> 57:24.502
Luckily, I've talked to them
and they're definitely open for negotiation.

57:24.572 --> 57:30.323
The only negotiations between me and the
giants will be over our vegetable deliveries.

57:30.397 --> 57:31.771
(Heston laughs)

57:31.836 --> 57:33.625
Good one, sire.

57:33.693 --> 57:36.410
This isn't a joke, Uncle Edgar.

57:43.004 --> 57:45.492
We'll talk about it
after your coronation, yes?

57:45.565 --> 57:49.307
Fine, but we will talk.

57:49.372 --> 57:51.609
Of course.

57:54.717 --> 57:57.335
l... I'm going to ask her to marry me.

58:01.373 --> 58:06.457
Who? This... this Ella of Frell?

58:06.525 --> 58:10.354
Yes. Tonight, at the ball.

58:10.429 --> 58:14.106
At the same time and in the same place
as my father proposed to my mother.

58:14.173 --> 58:18.363
- (Hattie) Get off! Do you know who l am?
- (guard) Come with me.

58:18.428 --> 58:23.065
- What now?
- (Hattie) Get off! Get off me!

58:23.132 --> 58:27.388
- So, Ella of Frell is your sister.
- (Hattie drinks noisily through straw)

58:27.453 --> 58:30.322
- Stepsister, actually.
- Really?

58:31.901 --> 58:34.967
Tell me, what do you know about her?

58:35.037 --> 58:36.793
What's in it for me?

58:36.861 --> 58:42.044
How about that your eyeballs
remain inside your head?

58:45.437 --> 58:47.858
Now, now, Heston.

58:47.932 --> 58:52.122
We like these girls. They're our friends.

58:55.037 --> 58:57.754
l can't find anything in any of these books.

58:57.821 --> 59:00.057
Benny, show me Lucinda.

59:00.957 --> 59:03.161
(Benny) No, still sacked out.

59:05.437 --> 59:07.826
l don't know where else to...

59:12.284 --> 59:15.699
Dun Flyin Retirement Community
for Faeries?

59:16.892 --> 59:19.762
Why don't we just cut to the chase, hm?

59:20.957 --> 59:26.259
l might even be willing
to throw Prince Char into the deal.

59:26.332 --> 59:31.154
Let's see, now. After the coronation
he'll need to take a queen,

59:31.228 --> 59:36.214
and shall we say... his hand in marriage?

59:37.500 --> 59:40.020
Queen Olive.

59:41.404 --> 59:43.771
For the eldest daughter, of course.

59:46.652 --> 59:49.238
Ella does everything she's told.

59:49.309 --> 59:54.044
l don't know why, but she does.
She can't help it.

59:56.508 --> 59:57.785
Lucinda Perriweather,

59:57.853 --> 01:00:01.115
Dun Flyin Retirement Community
for Faeries, Lamia Heights.

01:00:01.181 --> 01:00:03.602
Benny! Benny, we got her.

01:00:03.676 --> 01:00:05.716
Hello, Ella.

01:00:08.796 --> 01:00:12.855
l hope you've found everything
to your satisfaction?

01:00:12.924 --> 01:00:16.569
- Yes, thank you.
- Good, good.

01:00:18.301 --> 01:00:21.978
Oh, dear. How clumsy of me. Pick it up.

01:00:24.925 --> 01:00:27.412
Very good.

01:00:27.484 --> 01:00:30.452
Now touch your toes.

01:00:30.524 --> 01:00:31.702
Oh, no.

01:00:31.772 --> 01:00:34.358
Oh, yes. And while you're about it,

01:00:34.429 --> 01:00:39.644
why don't you pat your head
and rub your tummy at the same time?

01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:43.026
Now jump up and down.

01:00:46.108 --> 01:00:48.923
- Please stop.
- Wait.

01:00:48.988 --> 01:00:51.573
Perhaps you know this one.

01:00:51.644 --> 01:00:56.827
d Put your left foot in, your left foot out

01:00:56.892 --> 01:00:59.740
d Put your left foot in
and shake it all about

01:00:59.804 --> 01:01:02.138
d Shake, shake, shake,
shake, shake, shake

01:01:02.204 --> 01:01:05.238
d Shake your booty, shake your booty

01:01:06.396 --> 01:01:08.306
This is fabulous!

01:01:08.381 --> 01:01:13.815
Hate to be a party pooper,
but, Edgar, evil plans, remember?

01:01:13.885 --> 01:01:16.274
Yes, you're right. OK, stop.

01:01:21.788 --> 01:01:27.538
As you know, tonight is the coronation ball.

01:01:28.989 --> 01:01:30.898
At some point,

01:01:30.973 --> 01:01:36.341
amidst your frolicking and romancing,

01:01:37.596 --> 01:01:42.713
Prince Char will sweep you away
to the hall of mirrors.

01:01:45.052 --> 01:01:49.046
Then, just before midnight,

01:01:49.116 --> 01:01:53.905
he will take you by the hand
and ask you a question.

01:01:55.804 --> 01:01:57.692
How do you know all this?

01:01:57.756 --> 01:02:00.658
We know everything, my dear.

01:02:00.733 --> 01:02:05.337
And the one thing we know
with most certainty

01:02:05.404 --> 01:02:10.455
is that at the stroke of midnight
you will take this dagger

01:02:10.525 --> 01:02:14.681
and plunge it
through his heart and kill him.

01:02:14.748 --> 01:02:16.658
No! No, l won't!

01:02:16.732 --> 01:02:19.121
Oh, yes, you will.

01:02:19.196 --> 01:02:22.611
You will, because l order you to.

01:02:26.332 --> 01:02:28.242
(Edgar chuckles)

01:02:30.333 --> 01:02:35.766
Actually, it's lucky you're here,
so l won't have to do it myself.

01:02:36.861 --> 01:02:39.381
You'd kill your own nephew?

01:02:39.452 --> 01:02:42.616
Why not? l killed my own brother.

01:02:42.684 --> 01:02:45.783
What? Why?

01:02:45.853 --> 01:02:49.366
- l want to be king.
- Duh!

01:02:49.437 --> 01:02:51.346
Now go.

01:02:53.373 --> 01:02:55.445
Wait.

01:02:55.516 --> 01:02:58.483
There's one more thing.

01:02:58.556 --> 01:03:02.451
You will tell no one of this plan.

01:03:13.533 --> 01:03:16.183
- Can l help you?
- I'm looking for Lucinda Perriweather.

01:03:16.252 --> 01:03:19.351
- It's kind of urgent.
- Sorry. She was kicked out last week.

01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:22.103
- Do you know where l could find her?
- Nope.

01:03:22.173 --> 01:03:26.842
You don't understand. If l don't find her,
something terrible's going to happen.

01:03:26.908 --> 01:03:30.137
Finding her would be something terrible.

01:03:35.804 --> 01:03:38.106
(Ella) Dear Char.

01:03:38.172 --> 01:03:42.962
This is the hardest thing I've ever
had to do, and I hope you'll understand.

01:03:43.036 --> 01:03:45.971
We can't be together.

01:03:46.044 --> 01:03:48.727
I can't tell you why.

01:03:48.796 --> 01:03:52.309
Please believe
that this is the only solution.

01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:55.031
I wish you the best.

01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:58.581
I really do believe
you're going to be a great king.

01:03:58.652 --> 01:04:01.303
Goodbye for ever. Ella.

01:04:09.628 --> 01:04:15.509
(narrator) Now, if she stayed clear
of the prince until midnight had passed,

01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:18.395
then Char would be safe.

01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:21.330
But how long could that last?

01:04:22.876 --> 01:04:25.625
Slannen, where have you been?

01:04:25.693 --> 01:04:27.798
What are you doing? Never mind.

01:04:27.868 --> 01:04:30.999
This may sound strange,
but there's something l need you to do.

01:04:34.716 --> 01:04:36.626
You are one freaky chick.

01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:40.727
l need you to go back into the forest and
rally all the elves and giants you can find.

01:04:40.797 --> 01:04:44.179
- You want me to go back in there?
- You'll need all the help you can get.

01:04:44.252 --> 01:04:47.864
Someone has to get into the castle, find
Benny and keep Char away from Edgar.

01:04:47.932 --> 01:04:51.380
- Why? What's going on?
- l already told you, l can't tell you.

01:04:51.452 --> 01:04:53.394
But if you don't,

01:04:53.468 --> 01:04:56.817
you might very well be stuck
singing ''Kumbaya'' the rest of your life.

01:04:56.892 --> 01:05:00.918
Fine! Into the forest of certain death
walks Slannen.

01:05:02.204 --> 01:05:04.725
- Thank you.
- Yeah, whatever.

01:05:23.132 --> 01:05:25.369
(d waltz)

01:05:36.412 --> 01:05:38.834
Where's your little friend?

01:05:38.908 --> 01:05:41.974
Yes. She should be here by now.

01:05:42.044 --> 01:05:44.597
l don't want to talk about her.

01:05:47.293 --> 01:05:49.431
(bell rings)

01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:51.802
Agh! Oh!

01:05:51.868 --> 01:05:54.039
- Oh! Oh!
- (tree creaks)

01:05:54.652 --> 01:05:56.889
Slannen, please hurry.

01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:03.638
Would you stop that?

01:06:03.708 --> 01:06:08.465
When you steal from here,
you are stealing from me now.

01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:13.079
- What do you mean?
- This is my future home, isn't it?

01:06:13.148 --> 01:06:15.603
- (clears throat)
- Oh.

01:06:15.676 --> 01:06:19.025
Hi. l was just polishing...

01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:20.922
(giggles)

01:06:20.988 --> 01:06:23.377
Would you... would you care to dance?

01:06:23.452 --> 01:06:27.282
Are you kidding?
That's all she ever talks about.

01:06:31.356 --> 01:06:33.592
You wanted to look younger.

01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:36.726
If you spent less time on your face
and more on your maternal duties,

01:06:36.796 --> 01:06:38.968
we'd know where Ella was right now.

01:06:39.036 --> 01:06:41.174
(tree creaks)

01:06:41.244 --> 01:06:43.383
(thunder)

01:06:51.932 --> 01:06:53.339
Ouch!

01:06:53.404 --> 01:06:55.313
Whoa!

01:06:56.444 --> 01:06:59.062
What the...?
This isn't the salad bar at Brelly's.

01:06:59.132 --> 01:07:01.849
Lucinda. Lucinda! Lucinda!

01:07:04.892 --> 01:07:08.689
Oh, my goodness. Do l know you, child?

01:07:08.764 --> 01:07:11.186
Ella of Frell. You gave me a gift.

01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:14.556
Oh, yes. l remember you.

01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:17.435
- The obedient one.
- l am so happy to see you.

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:19.988
l have been looking everywhere for you.

01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:24.697
- l need you to take the gift back.
- Take it back? l don't think so.

01:07:24.764 --> 01:07:29.074
It's not that I'm not grateful for the gift.
l am, really.

01:07:29.148 --> 01:07:31.156
But because of the gift,

01:07:31.228 --> 01:07:36.345
I'm about to do something horrible
to this guy l really like and might even love.

01:07:36.412 --> 01:07:40.406
Girl, you out of your mind.
Everybody loves my gifts.

01:07:40.476 --> 01:07:44.021
Lucinda! Lucinda, l am begging you.

01:07:44.092 --> 01:07:47.572
l will do anything you ask.
Please take it back.

01:07:47.644 --> 01:07:50.132
You don't like my gift? Fine.

01:07:50.204 --> 01:07:53.335
Get rid of it yourself.
Don't blame me for your problems.

01:07:53.404 --> 01:07:56.666
- Did l chain your butt up to this tree, huh?
- Well...

01:07:56.732 --> 01:07:59.449
- Huh?
- But you...

01:07:59.516 --> 01:08:01.142
No.

01:08:01.852 --> 01:08:07.732
And, in fact, just to prove
what a gem l am... I'll unchain you.

01:08:07.804 --> 01:08:09.943
What? No! No!

01:08:12.316 --> 01:08:14.421
Aren't l fabulous?

01:08:14.492 --> 01:08:17.524
Now, look at you. A pretty girl like you
should be at the ball.

01:08:17.595 --> 01:08:20.630
- What?
- Go get down with the prince.

01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:24.245
- No, l can't go!
- Well, not dressed like that.

01:08:30.332 --> 01:08:33.877
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

01:08:33.948 --> 01:08:36.086
OK, that hurt.

01:08:36.154 --> 01:08:38.707
Give, give, give.

01:08:38.779 --> 01:08:40.787
You're welcome.

01:08:40.859 --> 01:08:42.899
Tell me about your sister.

01:08:42.971 --> 01:08:45.339
Olive? ldiot.

01:08:45.404 --> 01:08:47.640
- No, Ella.
- Oh.

01:08:49.148 --> 01:08:54.198
l don't wanna talk about her.
She's so dreary.

01:08:54.268 --> 01:08:57.529
- l just wanna talk about us.
- Us?

01:08:57.595 --> 01:09:01.557
It sounds even more wonderful
when you say it.

01:09:01.627 --> 01:09:03.537
(Ella screams)

01:09:07.707 --> 01:09:09.813
(Hattie) Ow!

01:09:18.492 --> 01:09:22.801
Something tells me
she just couldn't stay away.

01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:26.288
- We need to talk.
- Char, please...

01:09:26.363 --> 01:09:29.560
Please tell me
you never wanna see me again.

01:09:30.523 --> 01:09:33.752
l will if you tell me that you don't love me.

01:09:33.819 --> 01:09:37.529
- It's not that.
- Then why did you write me that letter?

01:09:37.595 --> 01:09:40.465
Tell me how you really feel about me.

01:09:42.876 --> 01:09:47.895
l love you. But l am wrong for you, Char.
l am wrong for the kingdom.

01:09:47.964 --> 01:09:51.760
ls that what this is about?
Ella, that's crazy.

01:09:53.148 --> 01:09:55.058
Come with me.

01:10:16.828 --> 01:10:19.064
The hall of mirrors?

01:10:20.988 --> 01:10:24.982
When l was little,
my father brought me in here.

01:10:25.052 --> 01:10:29.841
He told me to look in the mirror
and see myself as a great leader.

01:10:31.932 --> 01:10:34.583
Somehow, l never could.

01:10:34.652 --> 01:10:37.434
And then you come along.

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:39.736
Ella, what's wrong?

01:10:41.148 --> 01:10:44.214
l wish l could tell you.
l wish l could tell you everything.

01:10:44.284 --> 01:10:47.099
These last few days have been so perfect.

01:10:47.164 --> 01:10:51.190
Well, except for the bit
where we almost got eaten by ogres.

01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:55.352
And you wrote me a letter
that ripped my heart out.

01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:57.973
And l had to dance with Hattie.

01:10:58.044 --> 01:11:01.557
But none of these things matter.

01:11:01.627 --> 01:11:03.766
We're together now.

01:11:03.836 --> 01:11:06.651
And when we're together, it's like magic.

01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:13.915
- l never want it to end.
- l know, l know.

01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:16.762
- And l feel the same, but...
- That's why l brought you here.

01:11:16.827 --> 01:11:21.050
- Char, please listen to me.
- Ella, l know. You're scared.

01:11:21.116 --> 01:11:24.182
I'm scared, too.

01:11:24.252 --> 01:11:27.002
This is... this is a big step.

01:11:33.884 --> 01:11:35.771
Ella...

01:11:35.835 --> 01:11:39.927
Ella of Frell, will you marry me?

01:11:41.243 --> 01:11:43.186
(clock chimes)

01:11:43.259 --> 01:11:45.681
No, no, no, no, no!

01:11:46.235 --> 01:11:48.919
- No?
- No.

01:11:48.988 --> 01:11:51.770
l don't understand. What is it?

01:11:51.836 --> 01:11:54.422
My politics? Your family?

01:11:54.492 --> 01:11:59.347
Because those things aren't important.
What's important is what's in our hearts.

01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:02.104
If our love is strong,
we can conquer anything.

01:12:02.172 --> 01:12:04.561
l do love you, Char.

01:12:10.108 --> 01:12:14.264
- (Hattie) Ella, come here.
- ( Olga) Don't argue. Just do it.

01:12:14.331 --> 01:12:16.436
- ( Olive) Take that.
- Keep your mouth shut.

01:12:16.507 --> 01:12:18.482
- (Hattie) Take those.
- (ogre) Don't move.

01:12:18.556 --> 01:12:22.385
(Edgar) On the stroke of midnight
you will take this dagger

01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:25.941
and plunge it through his heart
and kill him.

01:12:26.011 --> 01:12:31.543
What's inside you
is stronger than any spell.

01:12:34.651 --> 01:12:37.499
You will no longer be obedient.

01:12:37.564 --> 01:12:40.434
You will no longer be obedient!

01:12:46.236 --> 01:12:48.472
(clock strikes midnight)

01:12:49.947 --> 01:12:54.006
I'm free. l can't believe it. I'm free.

01:12:54.940 --> 01:12:57.144
You tried to kill me.

01:12:57.212 --> 01:12:59.067
Guards!

01:12:59.132 --> 01:13:01.041
- No, Char...
- Take her away.

01:13:01.115 --> 01:13:04.017
No, Char, please.
Please, Char, wait. No, Char!

01:13:04.092 --> 01:13:08.664
Char, please, wait.
l can explain! Please listen to me! Char!

01:13:09.340 --> 01:13:11.031
No, please. No! No!

01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:13.304
There's been a huge mistake.

01:13:14.332 --> 01:13:16.055
Please.

01:13:16.123 --> 01:13:18.458
Just listen. Please!

01:13:22.684 --> 01:13:26.459
(Edgar) You realize, of course,
she'll have to be put to death immediately.

01:13:26.524 --> 01:13:30.299
l just don't understand.
Maybe l should go and talk to her.

01:13:30.364 --> 01:13:33.047
No. No, l forbid you to go down there.

01:13:33.116 --> 01:13:36.563
Your Highness,
your uncle didn't want to frighten you,

01:13:36.635 --> 01:13:40.345
but the secret police informed us
of a possible uprising.

01:13:40.412 --> 01:13:44.438
Those ogres in the forest,
they were after you.

01:13:45.308 --> 01:13:48.308
The girl was obviously part of the scheme.

01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:51.925
The ogres never planned to hurt her.

01:13:51.995 --> 01:13:55.192
She was just toying
with your emotions, Char,

01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:59.537
so she could get close to you
and commit the murder herself.

01:13:59.612 --> 01:14:02.132
l... l just don't believe it.

01:14:02.203 --> 01:14:05.400
Yes. Yes, it does seem quite fantastic.

01:14:08.635 --> 01:14:11.603
You let me worry about all this, hm?

01:14:11.676 --> 01:14:16.116
You just concentrate
on tomorrow's coronation.

01:14:17.948 --> 01:14:23.382
Sire, you know I've been working
with the Red Guard.

01:14:23.452 --> 01:14:28.722
Why not call them in now and take over
the whole kingdom like we planned?

01:14:28.795 --> 01:14:33.105
First we must find a way
to get rid of the prince.

01:14:33.179 --> 01:14:38.297
And l think l have
a pretty good idea how to do it.

01:14:45.819 --> 01:14:47.729
(cock crows)

01:14:51.292 --> 01:14:56.507
All right. We just have to find a way
to get past those guards.

01:14:56.571 --> 01:14:59.888
(Benny) Help! Please,
somebody get me out of here!

01:14:59.963 --> 01:15:02.680
Benny? What's he doing here?

01:15:04.411 --> 01:15:05.589
Ugh!

01:15:05.660 --> 01:15:08.180
- Slannen, you've saved my life.
- Are you OK?

01:15:08.251 --> 01:15:11.797
- l could kiss you.
- l think a nice thank-you note is enough.

01:15:11.868 --> 01:15:13.810
l think Ella's in trouble.

01:15:13.884 --> 01:15:16.731
Something to do with Edgar.
We have to find her.

01:15:16.795 --> 01:15:19.032
Show me Ella.

01:15:20.764 --> 01:15:22.968
Edgar's done this?

01:15:23.932 --> 01:15:29.147
We've gotta go in there and stop him.
It'll take courage, bravery...

01:15:29.211 --> 01:15:31.382
(Elves scream)

01:15:31.451 --> 01:15:35.575
l was gonna ask you
how you'd like to be eaten,

01:15:36.091 --> 01:15:39.539
but if it's Edgar you're after... count us in.

01:15:42.043 --> 01:15:44.563
Welcome aboard.

01:15:46.651 --> 01:15:48.659
Executioner coming through.

01:15:48.731 --> 01:15:50.641
Enter.

01:15:53.692 --> 01:15:57.554
- Help.
- l wouldn't do that if l were you.

01:16:13.564 --> 01:16:16.346
Open up. I'm Miss Frell's
legal representation.

01:16:16.411 --> 01:16:19.411
- Her what?
- Her lawyer, numskull.

01:16:19.483 --> 01:16:21.752
If the gauntlet doesn't fit,
you must acquit.

01:16:21.819 --> 01:16:25.529
Now, open this door before l sue you
for everything you own.

01:16:25.595 --> 01:16:28.410
Now, move it! Come on! Come on!

01:16:28.475 --> 01:16:34.291
Thank you. Slannen of Pim is not an elf
easily drawn into a legal battle,

01:16:34.364 --> 01:16:39.633
but when faced with a challenge
to equality, freedom and civil liberties,

01:16:39.707 --> 01:16:43.122
this elf will draw the sword of justice.

01:16:43.195 --> 01:16:47.538
And, furthermore...
Excuse me, what is going on here?

01:16:48.124 --> 01:16:52.401
- Well, can we at least take him to go?
- Put the nice man down.

01:16:56.539 --> 01:16:58.743
- (Ella) Slannen?
- Ella?

01:16:59.580 --> 01:17:01.489
Ella!

01:17:02.716 --> 01:17:04.821
- Slannen!
- Oh, Ella!

01:17:04.892 --> 01:17:06.485
- Benny!
- Are you OK?

01:17:06.556 --> 01:17:09.687
I'm fine, but Char might not be.
Show me Edgar.

01:17:10.748 --> 01:17:14.392
- (Slannen) That's Char's crown.
- (Ella) He's poisoned it.

01:17:14.459 --> 01:17:18.485
We gotta go. Come on. Come on, guys.
We got a coronation to crash.

01:17:18.588 --> 01:17:21.239
(fanfare)

01:17:30.491 --> 01:17:33.361
People of Lamia.

01:17:33.436 --> 01:17:38.105
Today is a very special day
for our kingdom.

01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:44.919
For today you are here to witness
the crowning of a king.

01:18:03.931 --> 01:18:06.168
Bring in the crown.

01:18:35.323 --> 01:18:37.233
Drop that crown!

01:18:39.291 --> 01:18:41.844
- ( Char) Ella?
- Seize them!

01:18:55.003 --> 01:18:57.337
It's payback time.

01:18:59.132 --> 01:19:01.335
Charge!

01:19:10.715 --> 01:19:11.827
Char!

01:19:11.899 --> 01:19:15.096
Kill them, and anyone
who gets in your way.

01:19:17.276 --> 01:19:19.098
Oh, my God!

01:19:28.859 --> 01:19:30.768
No! No, no, no, no!

01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:37.045
l can't believe I'm saving you,
after you tried to kill me.

01:19:37.115 --> 01:19:39.090
l didn't try to kill you.

01:19:39.163 --> 01:19:41.552
You get away from her!

01:19:44.027 --> 01:19:45.882
- Take this!
- (Benny) Hey!

01:19:46.555 --> 01:19:51.509
That dagger you were about to plunge into
my back was an early wedding present?

01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:53.522
Hello! Help!

01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:56.532
Mandy! Help!

01:19:57.403 --> 01:19:59.824
Fairies in kingdoms across the land,

01:19:59.899 --> 01:20:03.794
please help me turn Benny
back into a man.

01:20:06.907 --> 01:20:09.012
A pumpkin?

01:20:10.076 --> 01:20:13.785
OK, maybe l did try to kill you,
but that wasn't me.

01:20:14.971 --> 01:20:17.721
- What?
- Maybe it was me, but it wasn't my fault.

01:20:30.299 --> 01:20:33.812
Then Edgar found out about the curse
and he ordered me to kill you.

01:20:34.395 --> 01:20:36.337
So l had to break up with you,

01:20:36.411 --> 01:20:40.721
even though I'm pretty sure that you're
the best thing that's ever happened to me.

01:20:40.796 --> 01:20:44.091
That crown he's about to put
on your head, it's poisoned.

01:20:44.155 --> 01:20:46.195
Duck.

01:20:47.387 --> 01:20:48.849
Whoa.

01:20:48.923 --> 01:20:52.185
- Edgar's trying to kill me?
- Yes. Hold on.

01:20:54.140 --> 01:20:55.765
How vulgar!

01:20:55.835 --> 01:20:58.999
Excuse me. Thank you.

01:21:01.883 --> 01:21:04.818
Char, there's one more thing.

01:21:06.555 --> 01:21:08.792
He killed your father.

01:21:09.883 --> 01:21:12.883
What? That can't be true.

01:21:12.955 --> 01:21:14.930
Well, of course it's not true.

01:21:15.004 --> 01:21:21.495
Who are you gonna believe? This lying
little twit, or the man who raised you?

01:21:21.563 --> 01:21:23.800
(hisses)

01:21:28.891 --> 01:21:31.891
- He tried to kill Char!
- Get him!

01:21:31.963 --> 01:21:33.457
Uh-oh.

01:21:34.747 --> 01:21:37.911
Well, l guess that answers that question.

01:21:37.979 --> 01:21:40.248
You vile little girl.

01:21:41.276 --> 01:21:44.854
l should have disposed of you
when l had the chance.

01:21:47.035 --> 01:21:49.141
You almost destroyed this kingdom.

01:21:49.212 --> 01:21:52.921
You killed my father, your own brother.
How could you?

01:21:52.987 --> 01:21:55.289
How could l?

01:21:55.355 --> 01:21:59.960
l wanted something,
he was in my way, l got rid of him.

01:22:01.275 --> 01:22:03.992
(muttering)

01:22:04.059 --> 01:22:09.177
He wasn't fit to wear this crown,
and you're not fit to wear this crown.

01:22:09.243 --> 01:22:12.243
This crown is mine.

01:22:12.315 --> 01:22:14.682
This kingdom is...

01:22:16.507 --> 01:22:18.776
Oops.

01:22:20.923 --> 01:22:23.127
(all gasp)

01:22:23.195 --> 01:22:25.432
We won't be needing that.

01:22:35.963 --> 01:22:38.199
You saved my life.

01:22:40.827 --> 01:22:43.510
Then we're even.

01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:47.442
Ella! Ella, stop kissing him!

01:22:48.891 --> 01:22:51.858
You are never to kiss him again.

01:22:55.867 --> 01:22:58.834
You wanna bet?

01:23:07.739 --> 01:23:09.975
Marry me?

01:23:10.939 --> 01:23:14.288
- Now, that I'll do.
- (all) Ah!

01:23:21.499 --> 01:23:23.408
l now pronounce you husband and wife.

01:23:33.595 --> 01:23:35.570
