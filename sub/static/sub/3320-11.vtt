WEBVTT

00:02.480 --> 00:03.568
[laughs]:
Wow.

00:03.655 --> 00:05.005
That was incredible.
Yeah.

00:05.092 --> 00:07.703
Do you know
a good house painter?

00:07.790 --> 00:10.575
Really? That'’s what you
think about after we make love?

00:10.662 --> 00:11.794
What do you mean, "after"?

00:11.881 --> 00:13.448
Hey!

00:13.535 --> 00:15.406
What? I finished early,
I had time to kill.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.714
Anyway, there'’s a vacancy
in our building,

00:18.801 --> 00:21.325
and I need to give it
a new coat before I rent it.

00:21.412 --> 00:22.892
Oh, is it a nice place?

00:22.979 --> 00:24.285
Very nice.
Got a view of the park.

00:24.372 --> 00:26.156
Hmm.

00:26.243 --> 00:27.723
"Hmm" what?

00:27.810 --> 00:29.986
Just thinking.

00:30.073 --> 00:31.509
My lease is up here.

00:31.596 --> 00:34.295
Oh, Alvin,
that'’s a big think.

00:34.382 --> 00:35.818
You'’d be right across
the courtyard from me.

00:35.905 --> 00:37.689
We'’d basically be
living together.

00:37.776 --> 00:39.517
I'’m okay with that.

00:39.604 --> 00:40.997
Are you?

00:43.304 --> 00:44.609
Bonnie?

00:46.829 --> 00:49.310
Give me a minute-- I'’m trying
to decide if I can do better.

01:02.758 --> 01:03.498
Whore.

01:05.630 --> 01:06.892
Oh, good, you'’re awake.

01:06.979 --> 01:08.372
Can we talk?

01:08.459 --> 01:09.982
Yeah.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.723
What'’s going on?

01:11.810 --> 01:13.160
You know the vacancy
that just opened up?

01:13.247 --> 01:14.900
Yeah.

01:14.987 --> 01:16.598
How would you feel about
your father moving into it?

01:20.036 --> 01:21.255
Are you kidding?

01:21.342 --> 01:23.126
It was his idea.
Really?

01:23.213 --> 01:26.260
Well, I had just put the second
of three smiles on his face.

01:26.347 --> 01:27.870
Three?

01:27.957 --> 01:29.524
Well, okay, the third
was when I told him

01:29.611 --> 01:31.743
he could take a nap.

01:31.830 --> 01:34.920
Still, you got to
take it easy on him.

01:35.007 --> 01:37.227
The man had a heart attack
a few months ago.

01:37.314 --> 01:38.750
The doctors gave him
a clean bill of health,

01:38.837 --> 01:40.709
not to mention
I do all the work.

01:42.493 --> 01:44.365
So what do you say?

01:44.452 --> 01:45.757
I don'’t want him
moving in over there

01:45.844 --> 01:46.889
unless you'’re comfortable
with it.

01:46.976 --> 01:49.457
Of course I'’m comfortable.

01:49.544 --> 01:53.330
Having my parents together
for the first time in my life?

01:53.417 --> 01:56.116
My children getting to know
their grandfather.

01:56.203 --> 01:59.293
Wait. You think
you guys will get married?

01:59.380 --> 02:01.033
Who knows,
but whatever happens,

02:01.121 --> 02:03.732
you'’ll always be
our little bastard.

02:05.516 --> 02:07.518
Aw, Mommy.

02:27.364 --> 02:28.626
Not bad. Not bad at all.

02:28.713 --> 02:30.411
Now, I don'’t want
to rush you,

02:30.498 --> 02:32.108
but several of the other men
I'’m sleeping with

02:32.195 --> 02:33.588
have expressed interest.

02:33.675 --> 02:36.112
Yes, well,
I can'’t make a decision

02:36.199 --> 02:38.070
until I talk it over
with my girlfriend.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.116
What do you say, dollface?

02:40.203 --> 02:42.249
I say take it, baby, just stay
away from the building manager.

02:42.336 --> 02:44.120
That dame'’s trouble.

02:44.207 --> 02:46.557
Oh!

02:46.644 --> 02:48.690
I so get why I'’m cute.

02:50.126 --> 02:51.649
It'’s in my DNA.

02:51.736 --> 02:53.042
I'’m gonna need some help
furnishing this place.

02:53.129 --> 02:54.304
Oh, no,

02:54.391 --> 02:56.132
I'’m not falling for that trap.

02:56.219 --> 02:57.264
You'’re always complaining
about how your ex-wife

02:57.351 --> 02:58.917
made you feel like a guest

02:59.004 --> 03:00.745
in your own home.
This is gonna be your place.

03:00.832 --> 03:02.617
You should decorate it
exactly the way you want.

03:02.704 --> 03:05.402
Oh. Okay.

03:05.489 --> 03:07.535
I'’ve always wanted, uh,

03:07.622 --> 03:10.277
one of those leather
reclining couches.

03:10.364 --> 03:12.627
Oh, my God, with
the cup holders?
Yes!

03:12.714 --> 03:14.629
That'’s so not gonna happen.

03:14.716 --> 03:17.066
Come on,
let me show you

03:17.153 --> 03:19.416
what you'’re thinking about
for the kitchen.

03:20.722 --> 03:22.419
So friggin'’ cute.

03:24.639 --> 03:26.467
Wait, so you'’re gonna live
right across the courtyard?

03:26.554 --> 03:28.251
Yep.

03:28.338 --> 03:29.731
So we get
to see you every day?

03:29.818 --> 03:30.949
If you want to.

03:31.036 --> 03:34.344
In fact, I got you
a walkie-talkie

03:34.431 --> 03:36.694
so you can call your
old grandpa anytime you want.

03:36.781 --> 03:38.435
Why can'’t I use a phone?

03:40.307 --> 03:43.832
You can, but the walkie
is so cool.

03:43.919 --> 03:46.138
Can you text on it?

03:47.357 --> 03:48.532
Thank your grandpa.

03:48.619 --> 03:50.360
Thanks, Grandpa.

03:50.447 --> 03:52.188
We just want you both to know
that your grandparents

03:52.275 --> 03:53.929
are gonna be here
whenever you need us.

03:54.016 --> 03:55.191
Hugs and cookies...

03:55.278 --> 03:56.540
money.

03:58.020 --> 03:59.239
Why don'’t I use
some of that money

03:59.326 --> 04:00.501
to take you all
out to dinner.

04:00.588 --> 04:01.632
Roscoe, you like pizza?

04:01.719 --> 04:02.851
I love pizza.

04:02.938 --> 04:04.548
All right,
go put your shoes on.

04:04.635 --> 04:07.247
If you don'’t mind,
I have other plans.

04:08.422 --> 04:09.597
Oh, come on, Violet.

04:09.684 --> 04:11.555
This is kind of a big deal.

04:11.642 --> 04:13.253
Can'’t you spare a couple hours?

04:13.340 --> 04:15.037
He'’s gonna live,
like, 20 feet away.

04:15.124 --> 04:17.168
Why can'’t I have pizza
with him another night?

04:18.910 --> 04:23.088
As you can see, ornery bitch
runs in the family.

04:23.175 --> 04:26.091
It'’s actually on our crest.

04:30.748 --> 04:34.404
Wow, look at this!

04:34.491 --> 04:35.492
Do you like it?

04:35.579 --> 04:37.146
I do.

04:37.233 --> 04:38.974
Oh, good, '’cause I really tried
to make it

04:39.061 --> 04:40.976
how you like it
but, you know, nice.

04:41.063 --> 04:43.021
I love it.

04:43.108 --> 04:44.545
And I put all your clothes away,

04:44.632 --> 04:46.024
except for the ugly stuff,
which I donated.

04:46.111 --> 04:48.026
You did great.

04:48.113 --> 04:49.376
Thank you.

04:49.463 --> 04:50.986
Oh, here'’s your
credit card.

04:51.073 --> 04:54.206
Be gentle with it;
I rode it pretty hard.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.599
Why don'’t you keep it.

04:55.686 --> 04:56.774
Seriously?

04:56.861 --> 04:58.080
Yeah, I want you to have it.

04:58.167 --> 04:59.951
I love you.

05:00.038 --> 05:03.607
Alvin, I don'’t need your card
to prove you love me.

05:03.694 --> 05:06.175
I already memorized the number.

05:09.700 --> 05:11.267
Come with me.

05:11.354 --> 05:15.402
Whatever you say, 5471640...

05:15.489 --> 05:17.708
ROSCOE [over walkie-talkie]:
Roscoe-one for Grandpa.

05:17.795 --> 05:19.667
Come in, Grandpa.

05:21.973 --> 05:24.236
This is gonna get old
real quick.

05:27.675 --> 05:29.241
Grandpa-one for Roscoe.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.634
Go ahead, Roscoe.

05:30.721 --> 05:34.464
What you doing?

05:34.551 --> 05:38.729
I... was actually about
to go to sleep, buddy.

05:38.816 --> 05:41.079
At 7:00?

05:41.166 --> 05:44.039
That'’s midnight
for old folks.

05:44.126 --> 05:45.997
Okay, sweet dreams.

05:46.084 --> 05:47.956
Tell Grandma I say hi.

05:50.088 --> 05:52.047
I think he'’s onto us.[laughs]

05:52.134 --> 05:53.788
That was very cute.

05:53.875 --> 05:55.746
I can'’t wait for him
to meet my boys.

05:55.833 --> 05:57.269
Why don'’t we have
them over for dinner?

05:57.357 --> 05:58.532
I'’d like that.

05:58.619 --> 06:00.185
My ex-wife wouldn'’t.

06:00.272 --> 06:02.231
Then let'’s have them
over very soon.

06:02.318 --> 06:03.319
[laughs]

06:03.406 --> 06:04.799
Where were we?

06:04.886 --> 06:06.366
Well, according
to the scoreboard,

06:06.453 --> 06:10.152
it'’s Alvin one,
Bonnie nothing.

06:10.239 --> 06:14.112
Oh, well, then it'’s time for me
to get on the mound.

06:16.201 --> 06:18.421
Play ball!

06:21.598 --> 06:23.818
Ooh...

06:23.905 --> 06:25.776
[laughing]

06:34.176 --> 06:36.004
Okay.

06:36.091 --> 06:38.615
Whatever you'’re doing
is very subtle.

06:40.138 --> 06:41.836
Alvin?

06:41.923 --> 06:45.535
If you fell asleep,
I will never talk to you again.

06:45.622 --> 06:48.190
♪ I got my own bed,
I got my own bed ♪

06:48.277 --> 06:51.193
♪ It totally mine,
it'’s no one else'’s ♪

06:51.280 --> 06:52.934
♪ Oh, yeah, got my own...

06:53.021 --> 06:54.152
BONNIE [shouting]:
Alvin!

06:54.239 --> 06:55.763
Oh, my God, Alvin!

06:55.850 --> 06:57.808
Oh, man.

06:57.895 --> 07:01.116
Am I gonna have to hear this
every night?

07:01.203 --> 07:02.987
BONNIE:
Christy!

07:03.074 --> 07:04.859
Odd choice.

07:04.946 --> 07:07.688
Christy, help!

07:07.775 --> 07:08.906
Oh, God.

07:15.957 --> 07:17.132
Mom?

07:17.219 --> 07:19.526
BONNIE:
In here.

07:19.613 --> 07:21.049
What?

07:21.136 --> 07:22.833
He'’s dead.

07:22.920 --> 07:24.095
What?

07:24.182 --> 07:25.880
He died. Alvin died.

07:25.967 --> 07:28.230
No. No, no, no, no.

07:28.317 --> 07:30.101
I checked already. He'’s gone.

07:30.188 --> 07:32.234
Stop saying that.

07:36.760 --> 07:39.284
Yeah, I think my father
had a heart attack.

07:39.371 --> 07:41.809
No, he'’s not moving.

07:41.896 --> 07:44.246
Thank you. Hurry.

07:46.814 --> 07:48.642
He'’s gonna be okay.

07:55.170 --> 07:56.563
[walkie-talkie chirps]

07:56.650 --> 07:58.478
CHRISTY: Yeah, hi.
This is Christy Plunkett.

07:58.565 --> 08:00.088
Roscoe'’s mom.

08:00.175 --> 08:02.394
I'’m gonna be keeping him
home today.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.223
No, no, no, um, not sick.

08:05.310 --> 08:07.748
He lost his grandpa.

08:07.835 --> 08:09.445
Thank you.

08:09.532 --> 08:13.101
Um, we'’re gonna need
a couple of days here.

08:13.188 --> 08:16.539
Great, I'’ll pick up
his homework.

08:23.503 --> 08:27.071
You know, if you want
to watch TV, it'’s okay.

08:27.158 --> 08:29.334
I don'’t.

08:29.421 --> 08:31.336
Video game?

08:34.034 --> 08:35.515
[sighs]

08:35.602 --> 08:37.865
We'’ll get through this.

08:37.952 --> 08:39.996
VIOLET:
Mom?

08:40.083 --> 08:41.869
Be right back.

08:47.352 --> 08:49.006
Yeah?

08:49.093 --> 08:51.400
I'’m so sorry.

08:51.487 --> 08:53.968
What are you sorry about, honey?

08:54.055 --> 08:55.709
I blew him off.

08:55.796 --> 08:57.493
He wanted to take me
out to dinner,

08:57.580 --> 08:59.103
and I didn'’t have time for him.

08:59.190 --> 09:02.063
Oh, Violet.

09:02.150 --> 09:05.196
There'’s no way anybody
could'’ve seen this coming.

09:05.283 --> 09:08.504
But I was so selfish.

09:08.591 --> 09:10.288
Yeah, well.

09:10.375 --> 09:12.290
Yeah.

09:15.206 --> 09:17.948
How do I live with that?

09:18.035 --> 09:20.081
I don'’t know, baby.

09:20.168 --> 09:22.518
Stop being selfish?

09:22.605 --> 09:25.086
BONNIE [calling out]:
Christy?

09:25.173 --> 09:26.478
I'’ll be right back.

09:35.966 --> 09:38.360
What'’s... going on?

09:38.447 --> 09:41.015
I have nothing to wear
to this funeral.What?

09:41.102 --> 09:43.495
I mean, I have a gray dress,
but I really should wear black.

09:43.583 --> 09:44.801
We need to go shopping.

09:44.888 --> 09:47.543
Yeah, before we do that,

09:47.630 --> 09:50.851
I... need to talk
to you about something.

09:50.938 --> 09:53.549
I spoke to Alvin'’s
ex-wife this morning.

09:53.636 --> 09:55.420
Yeah?

09:55.507 --> 09:59.163
Yeah, she'’s pretty upset,
as you can imagine.

09:59.250 --> 10:02.993
I mean, her ex dying
in bed with...

10:03.080 --> 10:04.734
you.

10:06.475 --> 10:07.998
Doing what I get the feeling

10:08.085 --> 10:11.741
he didn'’t do very often
for her.

10:11.828 --> 10:13.700
It was never really
his home run swing,

10:13.787 --> 10:16.093
but he brought a lot
of enthusiasm to it.

10:17.225 --> 10:18.661
Right.

10:19.793 --> 10:22.404
So here'’s the thing.

10:22.491 --> 10:25.146
She doesn'’t want us
to come to the funeral.

10:26.277 --> 10:28.018
What?

10:28.105 --> 10:29.672
Her sons will be there,

10:29.759 --> 10:33.850
you know, her parents,
friends.

10:33.937 --> 10:36.374
It'’s kinda understandable.

10:36.461 --> 10:37.898
No, it'’s not.

10:37.985 --> 10:39.551
We lost him, too.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.685
I know, but we can find a way

10:42.772 --> 10:45.253
to pay our respects
some other time.

10:45.340 --> 10:47.429
No.

10:47.516 --> 10:48.604
That'’s not happening.

10:48.691 --> 10:50.606
What does that mean?

10:50.693 --> 10:53.000
That means I'’m gonna have a
little chat with the widow.

10:53.087 --> 10:55.089
If I'’m not back by dinner,
call the bail bondsman.

10:55.176 --> 10:56.177
His number'’s on the fridge.

10:56.264 --> 10:57.918
No, no-no-no, no.

10:58.005 --> 10:59.659
Let go!
No!

10:59.746 --> 11:02.096
Suit yourself.No! No, no, no, no.

11:02.183 --> 11:03.793
No, no.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.882
Thanks, sweetie.CHRISTY: Please!

11:05.969 --> 11:08.406
I'’m begging you!

11:08.493 --> 11:09.712
What'’s going on?

11:09.799 --> 11:12.019
Help me.
She'’s crackhead strong.

11:12.106 --> 11:13.411
Roscoe, take that
to the kitchen.

11:13.498 --> 11:14.978
Get out of my way, old woman.

11:15.065 --> 11:16.676
Not till you tell me
where you'’re going.

11:16.763 --> 11:18.155
Don'’t worry about it,
I'’m just gonna go

11:18.242 --> 11:19.548
smack the snot
out of Alvin'’s ex-wife.

11:19.635 --> 11:21.463
Yeah, I don'’t think so.

11:21.550 --> 11:22.856
Oh, yeah, you gonna stop me?
Now get the hell out of my way.

11:25.859 --> 11:27.295
Ow.

11:27.382 --> 11:30.080
Sit down.

11:32.648 --> 11:35.259
I wish I knew it was that easy.

11:35.346 --> 11:37.566
Bonnie...

11:37.653 --> 11:39.089
listen to me.

11:39.176 --> 11:41.613
I know this is very hard
for you right now,

11:41.701 --> 11:43.180
but you'’re not alone.

11:43.267 --> 11:45.313
You got a lot of people
who love you

11:45.400 --> 11:47.750
and will help you through this.

11:47.837 --> 11:49.273
You hit me.

11:49.360 --> 11:52.102
Yeah, and I'’ll
do it again.

11:54.017 --> 11:55.627
Christy, how are you doing?

11:55.715 --> 11:57.238
I don'’t know.

11:57.325 --> 12:00.023
I don'’t have time
for how I'’m doing.

12:00.110 --> 12:03.461
I think the three of us
should go to a meeting.

12:03.548 --> 12:04.941
That'’s a great idea.

12:05.028 --> 12:06.116
Mom?

12:07.248 --> 12:09.685
Fine.

12:09.772 --> 12:11.992
Violet, we'’re gonna
go out for a little while!

12:12.079 --> 12:13.297
Watch Roscoe!

12:13.384 --> 12:15.212
VIOLET:
Do I have to?
Yes!

12:15.299 --> 12:17.127
And we'’re back to selfish.

12:19.260 --> 12:21.131
I'’m gonna tell everybody
you hit me.

12:21.218 --> 12:23.612
I'’ll probably get
a standing ovation.

12:26.702 --> 12:28.791
Hi, I'’m Bonnie.
I'’m an alcoholic.

12:28.878 --> 12:30.575
OTHERS:
Hi, Bonnie.

12:35.798 --> 12:37.844
I don'’t even know
where to start.

12:37.931 --> 12:39.976
[softly]:
It'’s okay.

12:41.717 --> 12:44.285
Okay.

12:44.372 --> 12:46.678
There'’s this guy...

12:48.768 --> 12:50.465
...I used to love,

12:50.552 --> 12:54.425
and he burned me
pretty bad.

12:54.512 --> 12:58.168
And for a long time,
I prayed for him to die.

13:00.127 --> 13:03.870
And then last year,
he came back into my life,

13:03.957 --> 13:07.482
and he apologized,

13:07.569 --> 13:10.702
he did everything he could
to make up for what he had done,

13:10.790 --> 13:14.489
and, um...
I still wanted him to die.

13:16.665 --> 13:21.104
And then, I don'’t understand
quite how this happened, I...

13:21.191 --> 13:24.542
I fell in love with him again.

13:28.590 --> 13:29.896
And guess what?

13:29.983 --> 13:33.073
He died.

13:33.160 --> 13:34.552
I can'’t do this.

13:36.119 --> 13:37.947
Oh, damn.

13:38.034 --> 13:38.818
I got it.

13:41.037 --> 13:42.996
[door slams]

13:55.660 --> 13:57.097
[sighs]

13:57.184 --> 13:58.707
Oh, no.

14:04.365 --> 14:06.019
Hey.

14:06.106 --> 14:08.978
Go home.

14:09.065 --> 14:12.242
Yeah, like that'’s
gonna happen.

14:15.245 --> 14:16.725
[sighs]

14:16.812 --> 14:17.987
What are you waiting for?

14:18.074 --> 14:19.728
I'’m waiting for you to give me

14:19.815 --> 14:21.121
the "don'’t drink" speech,
get out of my face

14:21.208 --> 14:22.426
and let me do what I got to do.

14:24.602 --> 14:28.998
Just for that, I am not
gonna give you the speech.

14:29.085 --> 14:30.739
I had a good one, too.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.308
Just please leave me alone.

14:34.395 --> 14:37.572
I don'’t think so.

14:37.659 --> 14:40.444
In fact, that
looks pretty good.

14:42.055 --> 14:43.621
I think I'’ll join you.

14:43.708 --> 14:46.276
Same thing over here.

14:48.409 --> 14:50.672
You'’re bluffing.

14:50.759 --> 14:53.153
We'’ll see.

14:53.240 --> 14:55.329
You'’re not gonna throw away
your relationship

14:55.416 --> 14:56.896
with your family
and your whole future

14:56.983 --> 14:58.636
because of what happened
with Alvin.

14:58.723 --> 15:01.335
Hey, that was my speech.

15:06.993 --> 15:09.038
What do you say?

15:09.125 --> 15:12.563
You and me, over the cliff,
Thelma and Louise.

15:12.650 --> 15:14.565
Stop it.

15:17.003 --> 15:20.093
I was gonna start my life
over again with Alvin.

15:20.180 --> 15:22.312
I know.

15:22.399 --> 15:25.794
[crying]: I just can'’t
go back to being alone.

15:28.623 --> 15:30.842
You got me.

15:32.540 --> 15:35.108
Meh.

15:35.195 --> 15:37.066
[both laugh]

15:39.590 --> 15:41.331
[chuckles]

15:44.769 --> 15:46.554
Okay.
[clears throat]

15:46.641 --> 15:49.426
How about this?

15:49.513 --> 15:52.038
We go crash a funeral.

15:52.125 --> 15:54.649
What?
You heard me.

15:54.736 --> 15:56.172
Come on,

15:56.259 --> 15:59.959
let'’s go buy you
a nice black dress.

16:00.046 --> 16:01.264
What about shoes?

16:01.351 --> 16:03.136
[groans]
Let'’s not go crazy.

16:03.223 --> 16:04.702
We'’re still on a budget.

16:04.789 --> 16:06.008
No, we'’re not.

16:06.095 --> 16:07.227
How do you figure?

16:07.314 --> 16:10.970
54716400...

16:14.364 --> 16:15.975
Good afternoon.

16:16.062 --> 16:17.672
We'’re here today

16:17.759 --> 16:20.153
to celebrate the life
of a wonderful man,

16:20.240 --> 16:22.938
Alvin Lester Biletnikoff.

16:23.025 --> 16:25.158
Husband to
Lorraine Biletnikoff,

16:25.245 --> 16:27.987
father to Douglas
and Jackie.

16:28.074 --> 16:29.684
And Christy.

16:32.165 --> 16:33.427
All right.

16:36.038 --> 16:38.127
Alvin was taken from us
far too soon,

16:38.214 --> 16:42.044
but he lives on
in the memories of his family,

16:42.131 --> 16:45.613
who I'’d like to invite up now
to say a few words about him.

16:45.700 --> 16:48.920
And we'’ll start with
the love of his life, Lorraine.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.574
What?
It'’s okay.

16:54.578 --> 16:59.061
I would like to thank everyone
who was invitedfor coming.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.587
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

17:03.674 --> 17:04.980
I'’m sorry.

17:05.067 --> 17:06.851
LORRAINE:
As many of you know,

17:06.938 --> 17:08.853
Alvin and I had our problems.

17:08.940 --> 17:11.464
But just before he died,
he came to me

17:11.551 --> 17:13.902
and begged me to take him back.

17:13.989 --> 17:15.904
I can'’t listen to this.Get your...

17:15.991 --> 17:19.038
Stay.

17:19.125 --> 17:21.127
He admitted
he'’d made some mistakes.

17:21.214 --> 17:23.912
Two of them are here today.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.480
Okay, that'’s it.

17:26.567 --> 17:29.135
Hold my new purse.

17:29.222 --> 17:31.659
I should'’ve just let her drink.

17:32.747 --> 17:34.488
Hi, I'’m Bonnie.

17:34.575 --> 17:35.489
Hi, Bonnie.

17:38.927 --> 17:41.016
[quietly]:
You get out of here.

17:41.103 --> 17:43.410
Not until I set
the record straight.

17:43.497 --> 17:46.282
Alvin and I were in love
35 years ago,

17:46.369 --> 17:49.677
and we were in love
the day he died.

17:49.764 --> 17:51.374
And we were starting
our life over again

17:51.461 --> 17:53.202
with our beautiful daughter.

17:53.289 --> 17:55.248
Stand up, honey. Show everybody
how beautiful you are.

17:56.249 --> 17:59.121
No, thank you.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.255
Are you done?

18:02.342 --> 18:04.648
Not yet.

18:12.439 --> 18:14.310
Now I'’m done.

18:17.444 --> 18:20.099
Christy, start the car.

18:36.941 --> 18:38.900
You sure you don'’t want
any dinner?

18:41.511 --> 18:42.773
You want to talk?

18:46.386 --> 18:49.345
[softly]:
If I talk, I'’ll cry.

18:53.654 --> 18:55.482
That'’s okay.

18:57.788 --> 18:59.703
[sobbing softly]

19:03.229 --> 19:07.494
I have been
trying so hard

19:07.581 --> 19:10.061
to keep it together
for you and the kids.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.238
I just can'’t
do it anymore.

19:14.370 --> 19:15.719
Sure.

19:17.808 --> 19:19.723
I miss him.

19:21.290 --> 19:23.162
I know.

19:24.946 --> 19:27.253
I hardly had any
time with him.

19:34.738 --> 19:37.480
It'’s not fair.

19:37.567 --> 19:40.091
No.
