<i>Dear Diary,</i>

00:05.880 --> 00:09.000
<i>I was never that girl</i>
<i>who was into fairytales.</i>

00:11.560 --> 00:14.398
<i>I always thought Snow White was boring.</i>

00:14.400 --> 00:16.558
<i>Rapunzel was kind of a slut.</i>

00:16.560 --> 00:20.318
<i>And Cinderella was certifiably insane.</i>

00:20.320 --> 00:24.158
<i>I know I've technically</i>
<i>been complicit in a few murders, but...</i>

00:24.160 --> 00:26.240
<i>at least I don't talk to rats.</i>

00:27.320 --> 00:32.118
<i>But now I know the real reason</i>
<i>I never liked fairytales</i>

00:32.119 --> 00:36.038
<i>is because they always</i>
<i>end in the wrong place.</i>

00:36.040 --> 00:38.398
<i>Who cares about</i>
<i>the dress and the slipper</i>

00:38.400 --> 00:40.720
<i>and the ball and the talking animals.</i>

00:41.760 --> 00:43.598
<i>I want to see</i>

00:43.600 --> 00:45.680
<i>after happily ever after.</i>

00:47.200 --> 00:49.800
<i>I want to see Cinderella</i>
<i>and the Prince fight.</i>

00:51.120 --> 00:55.840
<i>I want to see them tear each other apart</i>
<i>and put each other back together again.</i>

00:57.840 --> 01:01.638
<i>Then... and only then</i>

01:01.640 --> 01:04.959
<i>will it truly be a fairytale.</i>

03:00.800 --> 03:02.878
She ruined the play.

03:02.880 --> 03:04.798
I heard it was terrible.

03:04.800 --> 03:08.438
-She threw up all over Amita.
-Oh, my God.

03:08.440 --> 03:09.960
Everybody's talking about it.

03:32.200 --> 03:34.760
Hello, Heather.
We've been waiting for you.

03:36.360 --> 03:39.238
Heathers. This is Heather.

03:39.240 --> 03:41.000
-Hi, Heather.
-Hi, Heather.

03:42.320 --> 03:45.198
Now, Heather,
you had something to share?

03:45.200 --> 03:48.598
Well... I feel betrayed.

03:48.600 --> 03:53.038
My protégé, who I literally made,
stole my spotlight.

03:53.040 --> 03:55.198
-It's not your fault.
-Trust no bitch.

03:55.200 --> 03:57.118
-I know.
-Thank you, Heather.

03:57.120 --> 03:58.638
Who's next?

03:58.640 --> 04:00.878
Well, I'm here because

04:00.880 --> 04:03.238
I'm having some issues with my career.

04:03.240 --> 04:05.638
My brand got trashed.

04:05.640 --> 04:07.838
And then I had this starring vehicle,

04:07.840 --> 04:11.238
and that fell apart because
of witchcraft, so now it's like,

04:11.240 --> 04:12.838
what's my thing, you know?

04:12.840 --> 04:15.118
-Just let it out.
-You'll get through this, girl.

04:15.120 --> 04:17.558
-You always do.
-Thank you, Heather.

04:17.560 --> 04:20.798
-Who's next?
-Okay, fine, I'll go.

04:20.800 --> 04:23.638
I'm here because I hate my friends.

04:23.640 --> 04:25.558
One best friend tried to kill me.

04:25.560 --> 04:28.398
Then my other best friend killed
herself, without even running it by me.

04:28.400 --> 04:33.118
And my third best friend ruined my
reputation and... fat-shamed me!

04:33.120 --> 04:35.520
I mean, what is wrong with everyone?

04:36.480 --> 04:38.360
And do you have anything to share,
Heather?

04:39.560 --> 04:40.920
Well...

04:43.480 --> 04:47.520
I am amazing.
I'm perfect. I have it all.

04:48.600 --> 04:50.398
And yet...

04:50.400 --> 04:52.678
my oldest friend, Heather Duke,

04:52.680 --> 04:54.120
basically...

04:57.440 --> 04:59.280
Basically, made fun of me.

05:00.920 --> 05:03.478
So, I guess that's why I'm here.

05:03.480 --> 05:05.198
I mean,

05:05.200 --> 05:07.200
what have I ever done wrong?

05:09.320 --> 05:11.558
So, do we all see a pattern here?

05:11.560 --> 05:14.198
There's a common thread
in all of these stories.

05:14.200 --> 05:16.318
-Jealous bitches?
-Ignorant plebes?

05:16.320 --> 05:19.080
-Broke down, stank ass queefs?
-No, Heathers.

05:19.920 --> 05:23.238
-The problem... is you.
-What?

05:23.240 --> 05:24.918
-Me?
-How is that possible?

05:24.920 --> 05:27.038
How could I be the problem, troll witch?

05:27.040 --> 05:29.358
-What are you saying?
-I'm saying,

05:29.360 --> 05:31.158
maybe it's time you faced it.

05:31.160 --> 05:33.398
We Heather Chandlers are having
all of these problems,

05:33.400 --> 05:36.200
not because of other people,
but because...

05:37.800 --> 05:40.000
we are not a good person.

05:40.840 --> 05:43.438
-Not a good per--
-This bitch, I swear to God.

05:43.440 --> 05:45.318
-Look at me! I am a victim.
-Are you joking?

05:45.320 --> 05:46.798
You do not know who you're fucking with.

05:46.800 --> 05:48.758
It's true. I've been there.

05:48.760 --> 05:52.358
I was where you all are now, but...
I changed

05:52.360 --> 05:54.478
and I know there is a way out.

05:54.480 --> 05:56.838
The road to being a good person

05:56.840 --> 05:58.598
is long.

05:58.600 --> 06:01.118
But the first step starts

06:01.120 --> 06:02.758
with making amends.

06:02.760 --> 06:04.758
-Apologize?
-To who?

06:04.760 --> 06:07.518
-To everyone you've ever hurt.
-But that could take years!

06:07.520 --> 06:10.398
I'm sorry, but it's the only way.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.160
The first step starts with saying...

06:16.960 --> 06:18.280
I'm sorry.

06:22.960 --> 06:26.158
Don't you think Heather M would be
proud of how far we've come?

06:26.160 --> 06:28.158
Heather Chandler's a total pariah.

06:28.160 --> 06:30.038
I'm the most popular kid in school

06:30.040 --> 06:32.998
and you've finally learned
how to apply foundation.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.638
Thanks, Heather.

06:34.640 --> 06:37.038
Okay, fine.

06:37.040 --> 06:40.238
And you and JD are still going strong.

06:40.240 --> 06:42.278
I wonder what I'll wear to your wedding?

06:42.280 --> 06:45.718
Something tasteful but that still
makes me the center of attention?

06:45.720 --> 06:47.198
Yeah.

06:47.200 --> 06:49.638
Well, if I ever get married
just promise me you'll wear all black

06:49.640 --> 06:51.558
because that will be my death.

06:51.560 --> 06:53.080
I mean, just like...

06:54.120 --> 06:57.718
JD and I are too in love
to do something as lame as marriage.

06:57.720 --> 07:00.120
That's for normal people, and...

07:01.200 --> 07:02.840
Well, JD and I aren't normal.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.278
He understands me.

07:06.280 --> 07:08.998
I mean, it took a little work, but...

07:09.000 --> 07:11.040
now we're finally on the same page.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.478
More than I ever thought possible.

07:14.480 --> 07:16.478
Veronica, I was hoping
all this sex you're having

07:16.480 --> 07:20.278
would finally deep dick the quote
of the day out of you but I guess not?

07:20.280 --> 07:23.680
Even the famous Heather Duke wit
can't bring me down.

07:25.560 --> 07:28.078
Hey, you wanna ditch gym
and go get Slushees?

07:28.080 --> 07:31.398
Only if you come out with me tonight
to celebrate Heather M's birthday.

07:31.400 --> 07:34.238
Oh, do you want to go to Gondalo's?
Heather loved that place.

07:34.240 --> 07:35.758
Gondalo's?

07:35.760 --> 07:37.438
Heather M wouldn't want us
to celebrate her birthday

07:37.440 --> 07:41.598
over chips and up-chuck con queso.
We're seniors.

07:41.600 --> 07:45.958
She'd want us to spend her special night
doing something she truly loved.

07:45.960 --> 07:49.000
Going to a bar
and getting older men to buy us drinks.

08:07.240 --> 08:10.320
I'm sorry I called you
a moldy potato-bug orgy.

08:13.680 --> 08:17.958
I'm sorry I told you you were adopted
before your parents had the chance.

08:17.960 --> 08:20.158
I'm sorry I told you you couldn't
pull off French braids.

08:20.160 --> 08:22.678
No one can,
but I shouldn't have singled you out.

08:22.680 --> 08:24.438
I'm sorry I made you
change your name to Maurice.

08:24.440 --> 08:26.198
It's okay, it suits me.

08:26.200 --> 08:29.518
I'm sorry I got your mom fired
from the pretzel stand at the mall.

08:29.520 --> 08:32.118
I'm sorry I told everyone you slept with
those two hatchet face bitches

08:32.120 --> 08:35.198
who work
at the pretzel stand at the mall.

08:35.200 --> 08:37.360
I'm sorry I got your mom fired
from the pretzel stand at the mall.

08:40.840 --> 08:42.159
I'm sorry.

08:43.799 --> 08:45.278
Why are you doing this?

08:45.280 --> 08:47.278
Because I'm trying
to be a better person.

08:47.280 --> 08:48.918
You are sick.

08:48.920 --> 08:50.838
What kind of wicked game
are you playing, Heather?

08:50.840 --> 08:52.320
Just hear me out.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.998
Heather, I'm sorry for pantsing you
at the Sizzler in fifth grade.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.238
I'm sorry I sold your underwear
to the Japanese.

09:02.240 --> 09:04.198
And I'm sorry I told everyone
I have a bigger dick than you.

09:04.200 --> 09:05.998
That's only true metaphorically.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.758
I'm sorry I created an online account

09:07.760 --> 09:09.758
in the voice of your weird mole thing.

09:09.760 --> 09:11.998
And I'm sorry it has 43,000 followers.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.998
And I'm sorry I gave an interview
to <i> Slate</i> about it.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.078
So that's it. You're sorry?

09:17.080 --> 09:19.238
-Yes.
-You,

09:19.240 --> 09:22.158
Heather Chandler,
are suddenly a better person?

09:22.160 --> 09:24.358
I'm trying to be, yes.

09:24.360 --> 09:27.360
-What day is it?
-Friday?

09:28.360 --> 09:29.880
And?

09:31.600 --> 09:33.280
It's Heather M's birthday.

09:36.360 --> 09:39.998
Oh, should we go to that toilet water
Mexican place she loved, like old times?

09:40.000 --> 09:43.880
You didn't even remember Heather M's
first birthday after her suicide.

09:44.920 --> 09:46.878
All these other twist-ties,

09:46.880 --> 09:49.598
they may have fallen
for your little apology tour.

09:49.600 --> 09:51.678
But you haven't changed.

09:51.680 --> 09:55.878
Heather M died and you don't even
have the decency to wear black.

09:55.880 --> 09:58.920
So, go have fun at Gondalo's alone,
Heather.

09:59.960 --> 10:03.718
I hope Heather M is looking down on you
from heaven,

10:03.720 --> 10:06.080
judging the shit out of your hairline.

10:27.080 --> 10:28.718
-Brianna.
-If you're going to hit me

10:28.720 --> 10:31.080
please do it below my waist
where I can't feel anymore.

10:32.400 --> 10:34.960
I'm sorry I yelled at you
for trying to kill yourself.

10:35.800 --> 10:39.118
And I'm sorry for yelling at you
for being nice to me after the show.

10:39.120 --> 10:41.758
And I'm sorry for nicknaming you
"Trailer Parker," which...

10:41.760 --> 10:44.280
while hilarious, was not very nice.

10:45.520 --> 10:47.280
It's okay, Heather.

10:48.320 --> 10:50.238
-Really?
-Yes.

10:50.240 --> 10:52.078
Forgiveness is
one of my favorite things.

10:52.080 --> 10:54.238
It gives me this warm feeling inside.

10:54.240 --> 10:58.918
-Jesus died so that we could forgive.
-Organized religion is a disease...

10:58.920 --> 11:00.240
I mean...

11:01.160 --> 11:03.080
Thank you for accepting my apology.

11:08.920 --> 11:11.078
Did you know Heather McNamara?

11:11.080 --> 11:12.560
Today was her birthday.

11:13.560 --> 11:15.198
Of course, I remember her.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.958
-She would bully me several times a day.
-Oh, right.

11:17.960 --> 11:21.838
And I always appreciated how funny
she was when she would humiliate me.

11:21.840 --> 11:24.638
I mean, sometimes you get bullied
and it's just plain mean,

11:24.640 --> 11:27.598
but she would always add something
clever to the mix.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.080
So, I'm thankful for that.

11:33.400 --> 11:37.320
Would you like to come with me to her
fave Mexican restaurant tonight?

11:38.320 --> 11:39.798
I want to honor her.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.278
A sit-down food store?

11:42.280 --> 11:43.920
Oh, yes!

11:45.160 --> 11:46.560
Great.

12:16.120 --> 12:17.998
So, this is Gondalo's.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.878
It's a dump, but they serve booze
to minors, so Heather loved it.

12:21.880 --> 12:23.840
I feel like I'm in Spain already.

12:26.280 --> 12:29.038
I'm just gonna operate under
the assumption that you don't understand

12:29.040 --> 12:30.918
doing things ironically,

12:30.920 --> 12:32.798
so just order the quesadilla,

12:32.800 --> 12:36.160
and, I don't know...
like it, I guess?

12:37.320 --> 12:40.558
Heather M would always eat
five bites of one on her birthday.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.078
I'm so sorry for your loss.

12:42.080 --> 12:45.158
You know, I think I can
make your hair work.

12:45.160 --> 12:47.638
We'll have to shave it off and then
burn it of course, but...

12:47.640 --> 12:48.960
Heather?

13:01.640 --> 13:04.640
Let's do a shot in honor
of Heather M's birthday.

13:06.680 --> 13:09.518
Two banana Schnapps
and yes, we're over 21

13:09.520 --> 13:11.720
and thank you,
we know we don't look it.

13:15.440 --> 13:18.718
It feels like just yesterday I was
yelling at Heather for being a slut.

13:18.720 --> 13:20.040
I miss her.

13:24.880 --> 13:26.558
To Heather.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.040
To Heather.

13:36.520 --> 13:39.398
Which of these assholes do you think
Heather would have been into?

13:39.400 --> 13:42.160
The poorest one with the least
amount of prospects?

13:43.640 --> 13:46.078
Oh,<i> mon dieu.</i>

13:46.080 --> 13:49.880
Look who's over there with that bootleg
Heather McNamara-looking thing.

13:53.160 --> 13:54.878
Mr. Waters?

13:54.880 --> 13:56.718
What a piece of shit.

13:56.720 --> 13:59.158
Poor girl.
She needs a mani, not a pedo.

13:59.160 --> 14:01.000
Didn't he learn
his lesson the first time?

14:04.120 --> 14:06.758
If I actually cared about
other human beings,

14:06.760 --> 14:08.238
I would take him out back

14:08.240 --> 14:12.000
and make sure he's never a menace
to the girls of Westerburg again.

14:14.080 --> 14:15.560
I love that.

14:16.600 --> 14:18.840
<i>Everyone in that room killed Heather.</i>

14:20.880 --> 14:24.638
<i>Heather McNamara</i>
<i>and Mr. Waters to the office.</i>

14:24.640 --> 14:27.600
<i>I was thinking if there was more</i>
<i>I could have done.</i>

14:34.160 --> 14:36.878
What is happening?
Why are you touching me?

14:36.880 --> 14:39.198
So sorry. Reflex.
I was gonna say grace.

14:39.200 --> 14:40.680
Do you mind?

14:43.000 --> 14:44.400
Okay.

14:46.680 --> 14:48.158
Dear Jesus,

14:48.160 --> 14:50.718
I know you don't have much time
to think about me anymore,

14:50.720 --> 14:53.958
and despite my love for you, have
seen fit to take the use of my legs.

14:53.960 --> 14:56.678
But you have mercifully left me
with a working tongue,

14:56.680 --> 14:59.798
which I intend to use
to enjoy this delicious meal.

14:59.800 --> 15:01.560
Thank you, Lord. Amen.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.840
My prayer came true.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.120
We'll take this whole column,
thank you.

15:10.960 --> 15:13.918
You know, I'm fine with the chips
and the tomato water.

15:13.920 --> 15:16.238
You're afraid of ethnic food.

15:16.240 --> 15:19.438
It's okay, it's just the same four
ingredients in different combinations.

15:19.440 --> 15:22.960
It's not that.
I had this kind of food in Guatemala.

15:24.040 --> 15:26.798
Wait. You've been to Guatemala?

15:26.800 --> 15:30.238
As a kid.
You know, missionary work.

15:30.240 --> 15:32.998
Digging wells, giving out medicine.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.518
I didn't realize that poor people
could also do charity.

15:35.520 --> 15:38.398
Of course, silly.
There's always people you can help.

15:38.400 --> 15:40.198
And these people are truly poor.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.680
Poorer than you?
And you still believe in God? Wow.

15:43.560 --> 15:46.120
I mean... Sorry.

15:47.600 --> 15:49.360
That's great that you help people.

15:52.800 --> 15:54.400
Heather, can I get something
off my chest?

15:55.720 --> 15:58.038
You know,
even though my cable is scrambled,

15:58.040 --> 16:01.038
I have seen several segments
of the movie <i> Carrie,</i>

16:01.040 --> 16:04.278
and so I think I have an idea
of where this night is going.

16:04.280 --> 16:07.998
I just ask, if you're gonna dump
some manner of pig blood on me,

16:08.000 --> 16:09.678
please do it after we eat?

16:09.680 --> 16:13.518
What?
You think I'm gonna Carrie you?

16:13.520 --> 16:16.358
-Why would you think that?
-Well, I just assumed, since--

16:16.360 --> 16:18.680
I'm a fucking good person,
you bitch.

16:24.360 --> 16:26.160
Here, let me prove it to you.

16:27.680 --> 16:30.000
I'll let you take a selfie with me.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.840
Give me your phone.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.598
Get on in here.

16:36.600 --> 16:38.520
Okay, here we go.

16:39.360 --> 16:40.838
Cheese.

16:40.840 --> 16:42.240
I think I got it.

16:46.320 --> 16:49.360
Could you post it?
I'm... out of minutes.

16:53.480 --> 16:56.358
I'm sorry, I literally don't understand
what you're saying.

16:56.360 --> 16:59.598
Rebecca, love is just an idea.
A theory.

16:59.600 --> 17:01.398
An antiquated one at that.

17:01.400 --> 17:02.958
You know what love is?

17:02.960 --> 17:05.798
Ownership.
I know you don't want that, right?

17:05.800 --> 17:08.958
Give me your car keys.
I'll claw his eyes out.

17:08.960 --> 17:11.478
Love is a concept developed
by the visually-privileged

17:11.480 --> 17:15.397
that seeks to control others.
You're too beautiful to be controlled.

17:15.400 --> 17:17.278
I think I should go. I...

17:17.280 --> 17:19.558
No, no.
Come on, just one more drink.

17:19.560 --> 17:21.038
Two whiskeys.

17:21.040 --> 17:24.358
It's just that I don't really
feel comfortable in places like this.

17:24.359 --> 17:26.157
I guess I thought you were
a good person, Rebecca,

17:26.160 --> 17:28.238
but maybe I was wrong.

17:28.240 --> 17:31.638
I mean, you said you'd have a few drinks
with me but I guess you lied.

17:31.640 --> 17:34.358
It's fine. It's okay.
You can go.

17:34.360 --> 17:36.118
I just didn't really peg you as a liar,
that's all.

17:36.120 --> 17:38.078
No. I mean, I...

17:38.080 --> 17:40.878
Sure. I guess I could have another.

17:40.880 --> 17:42.678
Great.

17:42.680 --> 17:45.640
Your make-up is messed up.
Go fix yourself.

17:49.040 --> 17:51.278
But babe, if I objectify you,

17:51.280 --> 17:53.078
that's a compliment.

17:53.080 --> 17:54.558
It's Kurt.

17:54.560 --> 17:57.918
Because I love beautiful objects.

17:57.920 --> 18:02.158
What if I die tomorrow? Then you'd
feel bad. Of course, you would.

18:02.160 --> 18:04.918
Besides, I miss your cute little mouth.

18:04.920 --> 18:06.480
I'll be right back.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.518
Hey, you don't know me but that guy
you're with is a really bad dude.

18:17.520 --> 18:19.038
Oh, he's harmless.

18:19.040 --> 18:21.118
No, look I know that you think that,

18:21.120 --> 18:24.158
but please believe me when I tell you
that you're wrong.

18:24.160 --> 18:28.118
You are in danger. You just need to go
straight out that back door and go home.

18:28.120 --> 18:31.198
-He means well.
-I saw him put something in your drink.

18:31.200 --> 18:33.878
-What?
-Yes, just now.

18:33.880 --> 18:36.278
-Shouldn't we call the police?
-Yeah, in Sherwood?

18:36.280 --> 18:38.118
They're just gonna find some way
to blame you.

18:38.120 --> 18:40.160
Well, I wouldn't want him
to hurt some other girl.

18:42.120 --> 18:45.000
Don't worry.
It won't happen again.

18:46.200 --> 18:47.560
I promise.

19:05.720 --> 19:07.518
What a bitch.

19:07.520 --> 19:10.398
And I put sunscreen on all over my body,
every day.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.598
Can I have some of this?
And then I put--

19:12.600 --> 19:15.678
-I can give you like, a whole--
-Heather, we're going.

19:15.680 --> 19:17.440
But I'm talking to Barbara.

19:19.040 --> 19:20.518
She's a poet.

19:20.520 --> 19:21.840
Good luck.

19:26.040 --> 19:28.278
You know what I love about you,
Veronica?

19:28.280 --> 19:30.998
You don't give a shit
what anybody thinks.

19:31.000 --> 19:36.678
You will boldly walk around school with
those split ends and you don't care.

19:36.680 --> 19:38.398
Oh, you should get a platinum bob!

19:38.400 --> 19:40.238
I want that to be your hair journey.

19:40.240 --> 19:42.478
Where are we going?
I want a grilled cheese.

19:42.480 --> 19:44.000
Why are we stopping?

19:45.480 --> 19:47.238
Just stay here. Okay?

19:47.240 --> 19:49.960
There's something
I have to take care of.

19:54.400 --> 19:58.358
<i>Today marks the anniversary of the day</i>
<i>that this leafy suburb</i>

19:58.360 --> 20:01.118
<i>was rocked</i>
<i>by the murder of a little girl.</i>

20:01.120 --> 20:04.640
<i>A murderer dubbed the Croquet Killer.</i>

20:05.800 --> 20:08.598
<i>Why have the Sherwood, Ohio police</i>

20:08.600 --> 20:12.718
<i>let this case go unsolved for so long?</i>

20:12.720 --> 20:16.598
<i>Well, you know what?</i>
<i>If the local police won't do their job</i>

20:16.600 --> 20:20.480
<i>and find this monster</i>
<i>who's killing our children,</i>

20:21.720 --> 20:23.040
<i>then I will.</i>

20:24.080 --> 20:26.918
<i>That's right, Sherwood.</i>
<i>You can sleep tonight because</i>

20:26.920 --> 20:30.558
<i>someone is finally doing right</i>
<i>by little Lucy.</i>

20:30.560 --> 20:33.198
<i>We are digging up</i>
<i>that little girl's dead body.</i>

20:33.200 --> 20:36.558
<i>We are digging it right up</i>
<i>fresh out of the ground.</i>

20:36.560 --> 20:39.758
<i>And trust and believe</i>
<i>when we test that DNA,</i>

20:39.760 --> 20:43.278
<i>we will find the sick</i>
<i>and twisted individual</i>

20:43.280 --> 20:45.838
<i>who did this and bring them</i>
<i>to justice.</i>

20:45.840 --> 20:47.240
Shit.

20:48.160 --> 20:50.558
-Greetings and salutations, my dear.
-I thought

20:50.560 --> 20:53.280
-tonight was your girls' night out.
-Change of plans.

20:54.960 --> 20:57.278
-What'd you have in mind?
-We're young.

20:57.280 --> 21:02.480
We're free. Let's make out, get Slushees
and avenge Heather M's suicide.

21:07.680 --> 21:09.238
I know Maui is pretty developed,

21:09.240 --> 21:11.278
but it's the only place
with half-decent sashimi.

21:11.280 --> 21:13.640
I hope I get to see the ocean
before I die.

21:17.280 --> 21:19.158
Okay, time to run.
I'll meet you in the parking lot.

21:19.160 --> 21:20.678
-It's fine.
-I'll wheel through the kitchen.

21:20.680 --> 21:23.480
Trailer... I mean, Brianna.
I'll pay.

21:25.880 --> 21:28.198
-Wow.
-It's my dad's card.

21:28.200 --> 21:30.798
He wouldn't send me to Tokyo this year,
so he can choke on my charges.

21:30.800 --> 21:32.280
Thank you.

21:33.440 --> 21:37.718
Other than the state of Ohio, no one's
ever purchased a meal for me before.

21:37.720 --> 21:39.518
Really?

21:39.520 --> 21:43.160
-Maybe I am a good person.
-Of course, you're a good person.

21:44.160 --> 21:46.598
You're confident, you're direct,

21:46.600 --> 21:48.958
you don't care what anyone thinks,

21:48.960 --> 21:52.720
and anything you put your mind to,
you achieve it.

21:55.720 --> 21:58.358
You'd be surprised how many people
disagree with you.

21:58.360 --> 22:00.200
Honestly...

22:01.280 --> 22:02.600
they're jealous.

22:03.760 --> 22:08.598
Heather, the reason why you think
you're better than everyone else

22:08.600 --> 22:10.520
is because you are.

22:13.480 --> 22:14.800
Brianna...

22:16.640 --> 22:19.480
you are my Guatemalan well.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.478
Do you drink?

22:25.480 --> 22:27.758
-Oh, I don't know if the Lord--
-Allows it?

22:27.760 --> 22:30.798
Yes. Jesus bought wine
for the Bible people, right?

22:30.800 --> 22:32.318
-I guess so?
-Great,

22:32.320 --> 22:34.560
then we're getting
margaritas. Cadillacs.

23:23.120 --> 23:24.840
Cheerio, asshole.

23:33.280 --> 23:35.038
Whatever it is you're thinking of doing,

23:35.040 --> 23:36.598
it's not too late to stop.

23:36.600 --> 23:39.358
What am I thinking of doing, Mr. Waters?

23:39.360 --> 23:42.878
Mr. Waters?
You-- You're a student.

23:42.880 --> 23:45.678
So, you're young, with a bright future.

23:45.680 --> 23:48.838
Look, whatever your feelings are
about me right now,

23:48.840 --> 23:50.440
don't throw away your life on this.

23:51.480 --> 23:53.680
Maybe you should have given
that speech to Heather McNamara.

23:55.080 --> 23:57.918
Heather. I loved Heather.

23:57.920 --> 24:01.078
Well, Heather was your student, so
love should have nothing to do with it.

24:01.080 --> 24:03.278
Heather wouldn't have wanted you
to do this.

24:03.280 --> 24:04.798
She loved me too.

24:04.800 --> 24:06.598
Speaking of love,

24:06.600 --> 24:08.438
maybe a knife through the heart

24:08.440 --> 24:10.118
is how you're gonna decide
to kill yourself.

24:10.120 --> 24:12.198
No, no. You don't have to do this.

24:12.200 --> 24:16.280
Heather was one of the only good people
in this town and now she's gone.

24:17.560 --> 24:19.040
And I blame you.

24:20.920 --> 24:23.518
-Babe, you want to do the honors?
-No, no, babe.

24:23.520 --> 24:25.958
This is your thing.
You should do it.

24:25.960 --> 24:28.878
-No, no, you should get to do it.
-I insist.

24:28.880 --> 24:31.960
-You're so good to me.
-I just...

24:35.040 --> 24:36.640
I'm really proud of you.

24:39.160 --> 24:40.920
Shit!

24:41.840 --> 24:44.078
You're both going to jail,
you sick fucks!

24:44.080 --> 24:45.720
Veronica, I need a grilled cheese!

24:48.040 --> 24:49.800
You're that low-grade skeeve.

24:51.720 --> 24:54.238
That's for taking away
my only lesbian friend.

24:54.240 --> 24:56.880
You know how hard it is
to find one of those?

24:59.920 --> 25:03.678
Hey, freaks. I'm starving.

25:03.680 --> 25:05.718
Heather had a lot to drink tonight.

25:05.720 --> 25:07.798
And she's not gonna remember
any of this, I swear.

25:07.800 --> 25:10.720
-What a pedo.
-We should...

25:16.320 --> 25:18.360
I love this bitch.

26:06.480 --> 26:07.800
Help me!

26:27.920 --> 26:30.200
I love you, Veronica.

26:31.640 --> 26:34.560
I love you too, JD.

26:48.400 --> 26:49.998
You know what?

26:50.000 --> 26:53.758
From now on, I'm going to start
hanging out with real people.

26:53.760 --> 26:56.038
No more friends
just because they're smart

26:56.040 --> 27:00.518
or hot or cool or interesting. No.
I want real people.

27:00.520 --> 27:02.000
Like you guys.

27:02.840 --> 27:06.158
I mean, Heather Duke wouldn't set foot
in a corn dump like this,

27:06.160 --> 27:08.038
let alone dig a well.

27:08.040 --> 27:11.118
You mean Heath? He has dug a well.

27:11.120 --> 27:14.438
-Several wells, with me.
-What?

27:14.440 --> 27:17.198
In Guatemala, at vacation Bible camp.

27:17.200 --> 27:20.358
Heather Duke... was a Christian?

27:20.360 --> 27:23.918
Oh, no. He was just
down there shooting a commercial

27:23.920 --> 27:25.998
for my church's special camp.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.520
He wanted it for his... reel?

27:32.080 --> 27:34.118
<i>Conversion therapy saved my marriage.</i>

27:34.120 --> 27:36.238
<i>Now I can focus on what really matters.</i>

27:36.240 --> 27:38.798
<i>Like digging wells for the poor</i>
<i>in Guatemala!</i>

27:38.800 --> 27:41.760
<i>Conversion therapy.</i>
<i>It just works!</i>

27:46.520 --> 27:48.238
Thank you, Jesus.

27:48.240 --> 27:50.838
Brianna.
As my new best friend,

27:50.840 --> 27:52.640
I'm gonna need you
to text that to me right away.

28:00.040 --> 28:02.280
No, come on, let's get you to the sofa,
okay?

28:10.000 --> 28:14.158
Veronica, I'm like... sad.

28:14.160 --> 28:15.760
Here, you want some cookies?

28:17.440 --> 28:19.238
I miss Heather M.

28:19.240 --> 28:21.158
She was like,

28:21.160 --> 28:26.078
edgy and hot and like... dumb.

28:26.080 --> 28:28.558
Yeah, I know. I miss her too.

28:28.560 --> 28:30.800
But I think we would have made her
really proud tonight.

28:33.080 --> 28:36.240
-To Heather.
-Okay, to Heather.

28:44.080 --> 28:46.158
Let me tell you a secret.

28:46.160 --> 28:47.640
Okay.

28:48.840 --> 28:50.160
Heather Chandler...

28:51.800 --> 28:53.360
is a bitch.

28:54.520 --> 28:56.558
Okay. Let's just get you home, okay?

28:56.560 --> 28:58.878
I hate her. Tell me you hate her.

28:58.880 --> 29:01.638
-No, I don't hate Heather.
-Why?

29:01.640 --> 29:03.358
We have to hate the same people.

29:03.360 --> 29:06.680
-That's what friends do.
-Heather...

29:12.320 --> 29:13.720
Heather?

29:31.800 --> 29:33.920
"Dear cruel world.

29:34.960 --> 29:39.160
I could no longer live with myself.

29:40.200 --> 29:43.518
I was imprisoned..."

29:43.520 --> 29:46.720
<i>"By my improper love for teenage girls.</i>

29:51.160 --> 29:54.398
<i>But that's not the only reason</i>
<i>I must end it all.</i>

29:54.400 --> 29:56.918
<i>I can no longer live with the guilt</i>

29:56.920 --> 29:59.640
<i>of murdering that poor little girl</i>
<i>eight years ago.</i>

30:01.080 --> 30:03.558
<i>My only solace is in the knowledge</i>
<i>that tonight,</i>

30:03.560 --> 30:06.838
<i>the parents of young little Lucy</i>
<i>will finally rest well</i>

30:06.840 --> 30:11.120
<i>knowing the Croquet Killer no longer</i>
<i>haunts this mortal coil.</i>

30:16.440 --> 30:17.760
Beautiful.

30:23.320 --> 30:24.720
You ready to go?

30:49.040 --> 30:50.840
I need coconut water.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.920
You're gonna make such a good mommy.

31:01.280 --> 31:03.120
I feel like I'm forgetting something.

31:05.200 --> 31:06.600
Good night.

31:11.080 --> 31:12.440
Good night, Heather.

31:17.320 --> 31:19.478
<i>Now I can focus on what really matters.</i>

31:19.480 --> 31:21.758
<i>Like digging wells for the poor</i>
<i>in Guatemala.</i>

31:21.760 --> 31:24.920
<i>Conversion therapy. It just works.</i>

31:56.200 --> 31:58.200
Now I remember what I forgot to do.

32:16.280 --> 32:19.360
I see Bride of Chucky
wants to play games.

32:28.920 --> 32:31.838
<i>Conversion therapy saved my marriage.</i>

32:31.840 --> 32:34.880
How did that Ursula-looking pork bun
get this?

32:36.080 --> 32:38.400
<i>Conversion therapy. It just works!</i>

32:39.760 --> 32:42.400
Oh, no.

32:43.640 --> 32:46.838
<i>And the best part about it was</i>
<i>he deserved it.</i>

32:46.840 --> 32:50.678
Sherwood is safer now...
because of us.

32:50.680 --> 32:53.400
-Okay, JD.
-Babe, don't you see?

32:54.600 --> 32:56.558
The world has failed.

32:56.560 --> 32:59.638
Assholes. Bullies. Pedophiles.

32:59.640 --> 33:01.918
Society failed to get rid of them

33:01.920 --> 33:04.558
but we, you and I,

33:04.560 --> 33:09.438
are succeeding in taking out the trash
the garbage trucks won't pick up.

33:09.440 --> 33:13.438
Can't we just have one night
where there's no society?

33:13.440 --> 33:15.758
No weight of the world?

33:15.760 --> 33:18.358
Just you and me.

33:18.360 --> 33:19.680
I'm sorry.

33:21.040 --> 33:23.720
I guess I'm just feeling
a little superior tonight.

33:33.400 --> 33:34.840
No more.

33:36.080 --> 33:37.680
Okay?

33:40.800 --> 33:43.200
We're done with all that for good now.

33:45.880 --> 33:47.360
Of course.

33:50.840 --> 33:52.200
Okay.

33:54.880 --> 33:57.680
I got to go study for my chem exam.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.440
Hey.

34:09.360 --> 34:11.199
Good luck on your exam.

34:25.600 --> 34:28.040
Chemistry is my favorite subject.

34:45.280 --> 34:47.757
<i>Today we will finally learn</i>

34:47.760 --> 34:51.280
<i>the true identity of the Croquet Killer.</i>

34:55.199 --> 34:57.360
<i>Hold on. What?</i>

34:58.680 --> 35:00.718
<i>Son of a...</i>

35:00.720 --> 35:02.798
<i>Well, y'all?</i>

35:02.800 --> 35:05.038
<i>It's just as I suspected.</i>

35:05.040 --> 35:08.278
<i>There has been an astonishing</i>
<i>turn of events.</i>

35:08.280 --> 35:12.558
<i>I'll tell you. Bill, can we pull up</i>
<i>a picture of this human excrement.</i>

35:12.560 --> 35:15.358
<i>This man left a suicide note</i>

35:15.360 --> 35:18.118
<i>confessing that he murdered</i>
<i>this little girl</i>

35:18.120 --> 35:20.278
<i>and begging her parents for forgiveness.</i>

35:20.280 --> 35:22.758
<i>Well,</i>
<i>it's a little late for that, creep!</i>

35:22.760 --> 35:26.398
<i>Luckily, the residents of Sherwood, Ohio</i>
<i>can sleep tonight</i>

35:26.400 --> 35:29.678
<i>knowing we have finally caught</i>
<i>the Croquet Killer.</i>

35:29.680 --> 35:31.318
<i>I'm Lexi Anne.</i>

35:31.320 --> 35:34.478
<i>More on this startling revelation</i>
<i>in a moment.</i>

35:34.480 --> 35:36.598
<i>Let's wrap it up, boys.</i>

35:36.600 --> 35:37.960
<i>Put her back.</i>

35:50.200 --> 35:52.118
Veronica.

35:52.120 --> 35:53.958
-Pâté?
-Honey.

35:53.960 --> 35:55.520
Veronica's a vegetarian.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.518
That was great pâté, Dad.

36:03.520 --> 36:06.238
But I got to motor or I'm gonna be
late for homeroom.

36:06.240 --> 36:07.600
Bye.
