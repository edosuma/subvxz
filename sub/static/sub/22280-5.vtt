00:06.133 --> 00:08.700
NARRATOR: On this episode
of Life Below Zero,

00:08.733 --> 00:11.867
Alaskans prepare
for dark winter.

00:11.900 --> 00:14.567
If you don't like winter,
don't come to Alaska.

00:14.600 --> 00:17.400
NARRATOR:
Glenn braves thin ice
for a new food source.

00:18.067 --> 00:19.667
Whoa.

00:19.700 --> 00:21.567
NARRATOR: Andy races
to break a new trail.

00:21.600 --> 00:23.533
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:23.567 --> 00:25.300
Chip must build
an essential tool

00:25.333 --> 00:27.000
in time for dark winter.

00:27.033 --> 00:29.433
CHIP: Basically armouring up
a sled for heavy work.

00:29.467 --> 00:32.200
And Sue tackles Alaska's
deadliest road.

00:32.233 --> 00:34.000
SUE: I've got mountain passes
to go through

00:34.033 --> 00:35.300
that are notorious killers.

00:54.067 --> 00:55.733
ANDY: You guys wanna
haul water today?

00:56.833 --> 01:00.200
Who's gonna get water?
Is Jack gonna get water?

01:01.567 --> 01:03.900
Today's the day of getting
a lot of chores done.

01:03.933 --> 01:07.433
So, first thing's first,
gotta go get some water

01:07.467 --> 01:08.533
out of the river.

01:08.567 --> 01:11.500
We've got a ton of water
flowing by our house,

01:11.533 --> 01:14.233
about a million gallons
an hour flowing (CHUCKLES)
by our house.

01:14.267 --> 01:17.033
I'm just gonna push
this sled down and
let the dogs run around

01:17.067 --> 01:19.167
-and hopefully
I can call them all in,
-(DOGS WHIMPERING)

01:19.200 --> 01:21.300
hook them up,
and bring the water back up.

01:21.333 --> 01:22.400
Let's go.

01:23.667 --> 01:26.800
Everybody come!
Everybody come!

01:26.833 --> 01:29.533
NARRATOR: Andy and Kate must
get water every fifth day

01:29.567 --> 01:31.700
for drinking and cleaning.

01:31.733 --> 01:34.633
With no indoor plumbing,
Andy must use the Yukon River

01:34.667 --> 01:36.233
as his water source.

01:42.733 --> 01:43.733
ANDY: Whoo!

01:46.333 --> 01:48.567
By far this is the most
dangerous time of year

01:48.600 --> 01:50.200
for me to do this chore.

01:50.233 --> 01:51.333
I'm always really nervous

01:51.367 --> 01:53.367
any time I go near
the edge of the river.

01:53.400 --> 01:55.967
The ice is hollow,
it doesn't take much

01:56.000 --> 01:57.967
to collapse ice
when it's hollow.

02:01.067 --> 02:03.167
Yeah, I've gone swimming
in the Yukon

02:03.200 --> 02:04.633
a number of times
in the winter.

02:04.667 --> 02:05.700
It's not fun.

02:05.733 --> 02:08.533
When it's slushy ice
like this,

02:08.567 --> 02:11.133
as soon as you go
in it's like cement.

02:11.167 --> 02:12.733
It just closes up around you

02:12.767 --> 02:14.500
and there's not a damn thing
you can do.

02:14.533 --> 02:17.500
I understand how people drown
on ice really quickly

02:18.200 --> 02:19.967
now because of how cold it is

02:20.000 --> 02:24.133
and how hard it is to
get out once you're in

02:24.167 --> 02:26.900
without some kind
of assistance.

02:26.933 --> 02:29.367
So I've learned
through experience

02:29.400 --> 02:32.667
that when you're on your own
you're really on your own
out on the ice.

02:32.700 --> 02:35.733
And if it happens,
kiss your ass goodbye.

02:35.767 --> 02:37.067
It's a killer.

02:37.100 --> 02:38.767
It's a killer out here.

02:42.200 --> 02:43.500
Everybody come!

02:45.967 --> 02:49.100
Attaboys! All right!

02:49.133 --> 02:52.967
Hey, Coug, I'm gonna...
Whoa, whoa. It's okay.
I'm gonna put you in swing

02:53.000 --> 02:54.533
so you don't have
to get close to that ice.

02:54.567 --> 02:55.767
-I know you don't like that.
-(BARKING)

02:55.800 --> 02:57.767
Everything I do

02:57.800 --> 02:59.600
I try and do
with my dogs around here.

02:59.633 --> 03:02.633
They're my buddies,
they're my tools,
they're my machinery.

03:02.667 --> 03:04.800
They pretty much
do it all for me.

03:04.833 --> 03:06.600
Most of all,
they're my best friends.

03:06.633 --> 03:07.967
I love these dogs.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.700
Okay. Hup, hup, hup.
Let's go!

03:10.500 --> 03:11.633
Attaboys!

03:13.567 --> 03:15.367
Up we go.
Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup.

03:16.300 --> 03:18.167
Yeah! Let's go, boys!

03:21.067 --> 03:22.767
CHIP: It makes
everything sweeter
when you can just go out

03:22.800 --> 03:24.900
and be reliant on yourself.

03:24.933 --> 03:26.233
When you go out there,
and you come back,

03:26.267 --> 03:28.100
time after time
and you make a living

03:28.133 --> 03:30.867
and after a pile of years
goes by, you're still here.

03:56.467 --> 03:57.700
No plane yet.

03:59.867 --> 04:02.567
CHIP: I've got
some wood coming
to make stuff for sleds

04:02.600 --> 04:04.467
because my old one
is beaten to death.

04:04.500 --> 04:07.433
So if I'm gonna get ready
for winter coming up here,

04:07.467 --> 04:09.533
I'm gonna need a sled.

04:09.567 --> 04:11.667
Well, now we're just waiting
for the plane.

04:11.700 --> 04:13.633
When the plane
gets here we'll see
what we got for wood.

04:13.667 --> 04:15.733
NARRATOR:
Chip and Agnes Hailstone
await the arrival

04:15.767 --> 04:17.733
of a daily freight plane.

04:17.767 --> 04:20.700
It carries valuable goods
from Kotzebue to Noorvik.

04:22.267 --> 04:24.267
CHIP: Cargo planes
are never on time.

04:24.300 --> 04:25.900
Another thing, too,
is that the weather

04:25.933 --> 04:27.933
is just turning to garbage,
total garbage.

04:28.667 --> 04:29.800
So we're not quite sure

04:29.833 --> 04:31.600
what we're gonna
be doing here soon.

04:31.633 --> 04:33.133
I didn't order any hickory

04:33.167 --> 04:35.033
so we're not gonna
have no basket sled.

04:35.067 --> 04:37.667
The only wood
that's coming off
of this order that I paid for

04:37.700 --> 04:40.367
is gonna be planks
and more planks.

04:44.233 --> 04:46.300
I didn't think it would come
in this crappy weather.

04:58.833 --> 05:00.500
Hey there,
you got some wood for us?

05:00.533 --> 05:02.067
Hey, Chip. Hey, Agnes.
How are you guys doing?

05:02.100 --> 05:04.533
Good. Well, we're
just happy for the snow.

05:04.567 --> 05:07.100
-Lucky we got in here
when we did.
-CHIP: Yep.

05:07.133 --> 05:09.433
They're probably gonna
shut down the pass today.

05:09.467 --> 05:10.767
-Right on.
-MAN: Here's some wood, guys.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.700
-CHIP: Yep, thanks!
-Take care, guys.

05:13.733 --> 05:15.100
-Yep.
-MAN: See you.

05:15.767 --> 05:17.167
AGNES: (CHUCKLES) Bye.

05:23.167 --> 05:26.167
CHIP: It's just so cold that
I'm gonna call it a night.

05:26.200 --> 05:27.667
I can't win the weather.

05:27.700 --> 05:30.067
The wind's just too cold
to drive a nail

05:30.100 --> 05:31.400
through without
cracking it up.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.767
So there's tomorrow.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.033
I do indeed have tomorrow.

05:40.833 --> 05:41.833
(WHIRRING)

05:45.900 --> 05:48.400
Well, the first thing
I'm doing here is
I am taking a board

05:48.433 --> 05:50.200
and I'm going to
make it into runners
and I'm dividing it up.

05:56.833 --> 05:58.133
You can rely on these
to pull up

05:58.167 --> 05:59.833
to a thousand pounds total.

05:59.867 --> 06:01.067
They take quite a beating.

06:01.100 --> 06:03.833
You're going through trails
and places that have no roads.

06:03.867 --> 06:05.167
They're not smooth.

06:05.200 --> 06:06.600
They're just bump,
after bump, after bump

06:06.633 --> 06:08.567
for hundreds
and hundreds of miles.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.600
I'm working on cross pieces.

06:10.633 --> 06:12.200
So as soon as
I have my cross pieces done

06:12.233 --> 06:13.533
and I've got seven of them,

06:14.400 --> 06:15.900
I'll start to inlet them.

06:18.100 --> 06:19.833
You go around
on snow machines up here.

06:19.867 --> 06:21.233
We go around on boats.

06:21.267 --> 06:22.933
A lot of people seem to think
that snow machining

06:22.967 --> 06:25.767
and boating is recreational,

06:25.800 --> 06:27.033
and for us it's not.

06:27.067 --> 06:29.000
It's a machine
that meets the conditions

06:29.033 --> 06:31.400
that we have here
to be a utility vehicle.

06:34.300 --> 06:36.100
That's a pretty
tight fit there.

06:36.133 --> 06:37.667
So when it comes
to stuff like this,

06:37.700 --> 06:39.333
this here makes my ride

06:39.367 --> 06:42.600
or my wife's ride
or my daughter's ride
into a pickup truck.

06:42.633 --> 06:44.633
And nobody sells these kind.

06:44.667 --> 06:46.133
I've got to build them myself.

06:46.167 --> 06:48.667
And they're just
a good way to go.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.367
I'm getting close
to being done.

06:50.400 --> 06:52.400
The runners are done,
the cross pieces are done.

06:52.433 --> 06:53.733
I'm getting the top end done.

06:53.767 --> 06:56.433
It's all good.

06:56.467 --> 06:58.267
GLENN:
A lot of my time out here
is spent just looking

06:58.300 --> 06:59.800
around the mountains,
just watching

06:59.833 --> 07:01.133
and then going up
on the mountains

07:01.167 --> 07:03.133
looking down at the valley,
just seeing what's going on.

07:03.167 --> 07:05.400
So often when I'm doing
one thing

07:05.433 --> 07:07.433
another opportunity
presents itself.

07:23.467 --> 07:27.100
NARRATOR: Glenn Villeneuve
has lived off moose
for the past month.

07:27.133 --> 07:29.067
Needing to diversify his diet,

07:29.100 --> 07:30.633
he heads out
to the frozen lake

07:30.667 --> 07:32.267
in search of fresh fish.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.600
I can't see the ice
under the snow.

07:41.633 --> 07:43.767
I don't know exactly
what it looks like,

07:46.467 --> 07:48.367
-how thick it is.
-(CREAKING)

07:48.800 --> 07:49.900
Hear that?

07:52.767 --> 07:53.767
Whoa.

07:55.100 --> 07:56.200
It's deeper right there.

08:00.400 --> 08:02.567
That ice is not very thick
right there.

08:02.600 --> 08:04.833
I have to be careful
of thin ice,

08:04.867 --> 08:06.600
and I have to watch out
for overflow.

08:06.633 --> 08:09.933
If I get my feet wet
when it's this cold,
I could freeze my feet.

08:11.167 --> 08:14.333
It's seven below zero.
That snow's insulating the ice

08:14.367 --> 08:16.400
and the warmth of the water
underneath of it

08:16.433 --> 08:18.533
is keeping it from freezing
very thick.

08:18.567 --> 08:20.167
That's good
for putting in holes.

08:27.500 --> 08:29.700
Ice there is about
five inches thick.

08:30.733 --> 08:31.833
That's good.

08:31.867 --> 08:33.833
It's easy to get through
to put in the lines.

08:33.867 --> 08:36.567
I can put in a lot of lines
when the ice is thin,

08:36.600 --> 08:38.367
have a better chance
of catching fish.

08:38.400 --> 08:42.267
This is the only time of year
I fish through the ice,
when the ice is thin.

08:42.300 --> 08:44.400
I'm trying to catch
burbot here.

08:44.433 --> 08:46.633
Burbot are a fish that feeds
on the bottom.

08:46.667 --> 08:48.000
I'm trying
to put the bait down

08:48.033 --> 08:50.133
right next to a bank here
where it drops off,

08:50.167 --> 08:52.300
where the burbot
may be swimming
along the edge.

08:55.567 --> 08:57.567
So that's on the bottom
down there.

09:00.200 --> 09:03.567
This cable is gonna
get frozen right in.

09:03.600 --> 09:06.733
I'll come over
and chip it out tomorrow.

09:06.767 --> 09:08.933
Got my first hole,
I'd like to make a lot more.

09:09.533 --> 09:11.000
The more holes I put in,

09:11.033 --> 09:13.300
the better chance I got
of catching some fish.

09:35.300 --> 09:37.167
There, that's the last one.

09:37.200 --> 09:38.533
That's good,
I got a good chance

09:38.567 --> 09:40.500
of catching something
with all those holes out here.

09:41.933 --> 09:43.000
I'm gonna
leave them overnight,

09:43.033 --> 09:44.233
come back tomorrow
and check them.

09:45.300 --> 09:46.967
Hopefully I'll have some fish.

09:49.200 --> 09:52.600
SUE: A lot of people go remote
and they just go crazy.

09:52.633 --> 09:54.333
For me, that tends
to happen more

09:54.367 --> 09:57.533
if I go to town
and I stay far longer
than I had planned on,

09:57.567 --> 09:59.000
or I can't get out.

09:59.033 --> 10:00.567
I call it getting town flu.

10:07.233 --> 10:08.700
SUE: All right.
Well, thank you.

10:08.733 --> 10:10.000
MAN: Take care,
we'll see you, Susan.

10:10.033 --> 10:11.800
NARRATOR: Sue Aikens
has spent several days

10:11.833 --> 10:14.467
in Fairbanks recovering
from a foot procedure.

10:14.500 --> 10:17.933
Fully healed,
she plans to go home to Kavik

10:17.967 --> 10:20.633
but a massive blizzard
stands in her way.

10:20.667 --> 10:22.100
SUE: Flight's been called.

10:22.133 --> 10:23.500
Which means,
cancelled for the day,

10:23.533 --> 10:25.000
they're not even gonna
keep trying.

10:25.033 --> 10:27.900
My brain is going, "Get home,
get home, get home."

10:27.933 --> 10:30.300
I got the gen running,
I got the fuel tanks.

10:30.333 --> 10:33.333
I don't know if there's
animals running around.

10:33.367 --> 10:34.967
I don't know what's going on.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.533
NARRATOR:
With the possibility of
being stranded in town

10:37.567 --> 10:38.900
for another week,

10:38.933 --> 10:40.833
Sue's arranged
for a bush pilot

10:40.867 --> 10:42.933
to fly her out of
Prudhoe Bay.

10:42.967 --> 10:45.400
All she has to do
is get there.

10:45.433 --> 10:46.933
SUE: I decided
to get a vehicle

10:46.967 --> 10:49.400
and drive the 500 miles
up the haul road.

10:49.433 --> 10:51.200
A lot of people
call it the ice road.

10:51.233 --> 10:53.167
Five hundred mile
stretch of road

10:53.200 --> 10:56.467
that is just nothing
but ice, snow,

10:56.500 --> 10:58.400
and some of the worst
conditions you've got.

11:01.233 --> 11:03.033
"This is the state of Alaska,

11:03.067 --> 11:05.100
"travel advisory's
been updated.

11:05.133 --> 11:08.767
"Blizzard conditions,
high winds, gusts up to 50.

11:08.800 --> 11:10.167
"Blowing snow, drifting snow,

11:10.200 --> 11:12.633
"poor visibility,
less than 200 feet.

11:12.667 --> 11:14.267
"Travel is not recommended."

11:14.300 --> 11:16.267
Well, they don't live where
I live, and I gotta get home.

11:35.033 --> 11:38.000
Two days of dangerous driving,
it's on the list.

11:38.033 --> 11:41.400
I just gotta strap myself
in a seat and get it though.

11:41.433 --> 11:43.433
You know,
that's just part of who I am.

11:43.467 --> 11:46.333
I cannot justify staying
another week or two

11:46.367 --> 11:48.467
and just saying,
"Wow, it's pretty bad.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.833
"I guess I'm just gonna have
to take it in the shorts."

11:50.867 --> 11:53.900
My way of thinking is,
"Wow, it's pretty bad.

11:53.933 --> 11:57.600
"I better go tame that tiger,
get up the road
and get out home."

11:57.633 --> 12:00.433
I am responsible for camp.

12:00.467 --> 12:02.633
Camp repre...
If I have the camp

12:02.667 --> 12:05.333
and I have a business,
then I have a right to stay

12:05.367 --> 12:07.300
and live my life
where I wanna live it.

12:07.333 --> 12:11.433
If I lose that camp,
I can't afford to rebuild.

12:11.467 --> 12:14.533
I will lose that lifestyle
whether I want to or not.

12:21.467 --> 12:24.633
Looking further north,
as we approach,

12:24.667 --> 12:26.033
we go further up the road

12:26.067 --> 12:28.000
and we approach the brooks

12:28.033 --> 12:29.767
and the foothills
of the mountains.

12:29.800 --> 12:32.333
The closer we get,
you've got the fog

12:32.367 --> 12:35.567
and the storm that's blasting
the north slope,

12:36.167 --> 12:37.367
hanging out there.

12:37.400 --> 12:39.267
I mean, you're still hundreds
of miles away

12:39.300 --> 12:40.600
from where the real action is.

12:41.233 --> 12:43.733
But the storm systems

12:43.767 --> 12:46.967
fan out, filter out,
and find their own boundaries.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
-I'm going right
into the thick of it.
-(METAL CLANKS)

12:53.467 --> 12:54.833
Are you fucking kidding me?

12:59.467 --> 13:02.067
I was coming up
the pass and...
(IMITATES METAL CLANKING)

13:02.100 --> 13:03.700
I mean, it sounded
definitely metal

13:03.733 --> 13:05.700
and boom,
hit the undercarriage.

13:05.733 --> 13:07.300
And, oh, here's one.

13:08.300 --> 13:09.333
Let's see.

13:11.767 --> 13:13.500
I don't know what it is.

13:13.533 --> 13:15.000
That's got to be
the other half.

13:18.133 --> 13:19.767
Some kind of a...

13:22.267 --> 13:24.433
...joint or a fastener,
I don't know.

13:24.467 --> 13:26.800
Brakes or whatever,
I'm not quite sure.

13:27.867 --> 13:31.000
Came tumbling off and busted.

13:31.033 --> 13:34.133
So hopefully
it ain't important.

13:34.567 --> 13:35.567
We'll see.

13:36.800 --> 13:41.800
So I'm 170 miles
from the next destination

13:41.833 --> 13:44.367
that might be able
to help me out.

13:44.400 --> 13:47.467
And still good to go.
I'm gonna go slowly,

13:49.467 --> 13:52.800
make sure I'm not
gonna break down.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.800
Go forward,
make sure I got brakes.

13:58.567 --> 13:59.700
Yep.

14:04.067 --> 14:07.733
There's two theories,
go fast, get there quick

14:07.767 --> 14:09.600
before you have
another problem.

14:09.633 --> 14:13.467
Or go slow in case
you drop your drive train

14:13.500 --> 14:14.933
and have to make out
with the trees

14:14.967 --> 14:17.233
on the side of the road.

14:17.267 --> 14:20.967
Now, if my wheel passes me
on one of these sections

14:21.000 --> 14:24.733
then I know it probably
was a bad idea to progress.

14:28.600 --> 14:32.733
We are about 50, 60 miles
still from the storm.

14:32.767 --> 14:36.900
I much, much, much
wanted to be there
in the daytime so I could see.

14:37.800 --> 14:40.033
It enhances my comfort level.

14:40.067 --> 14:42.533
You know,
it's already darkening

14:43.100 --> 14:45.333
towards night time.

14:45.367 --> 14:48.167
And we're only 2:00-something
in the afternoon.

14:48.200 --> 14:51.400
So you've only,
you know, tiny little window.

14:51.433 --> 14:55.200
But the further north I go,
the tinier that window gets.

14:57.467 --> 15:02.133
You know, you're heading
into the long night of winter.

15:02.167 --> 15:04.300
Would have increased
my comfort level

15:04.333 --> 15:07.433
just to hit the creepy patch

15:07.467 --> 15:08.967
during the light.

15:09.000 --> 15:13.833
That way if I do miscalculate
and end up in the tundra,

15:13.867 --> 15:15.867
at least in my brain
somebody might pass

15:15.900 --> 15:17.067
and see me sitting there.

15:19.400 --> 15:21.567
GLENN: I live simple
and I live close to nature.

15:21.600 --> 15:23.067
I love nature,
I love the wilderness,

15:23.100 --> 15:24.767
that's why I live in Alaska.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.733
There's no place left
where you can do this.

15:36.933 --> 15:38.967
I got 15 hooks
out on the lake,

15:39.000 --> 15:40.933
good chance
I caught something.

15:40.967 --> 15:43.433
Here's the first hook,
I'm gonna check it.

15:43.467 --> 15:44.867
It's been in there
since yesterday.

15:44.900 --> 15:45.967
Hopefully I've got fish.

15:50.300 --> 15:51.833
The water
has refrozen overnight.

15:51.867 --> 15:55.067
The hook's down there on the
bottom with some bait on it.

15:55.100 --> 15:58.400
I've got to chip it out,
see if I got a fish.

16:10.700 --> 16:11.700
Nothing.

16:12.567 --> 16:14.033
Put it back down there.

16:16.733 --> 16:19.167
It's only been one night.
I'm just getting started.

16:19.200 --> 16:21.733
Can't be discouraged
just 'cause there's not
a fish on it.

16:21.767 --> 16:24.833
I'll put it back down in,
come check it again tomorrow.

16:25.667 --> 16:26.767
Onto the next hole.

16:35.533 --> 16:36.567
Nothing.

16:37.600 --> 16:38.833
That's the way it goes.

16:38.867 --> 16:42.167
Sometimes the fish are here
and sometimes they're not.

16:42.200 --> 16:45.200
It requires patience,
like a lot of things,

16:45.967 --> 16:47.000
the way I live.

16:47.033 --> 16:48.100
You have to be patient.

16:54.533 --> 16:55.533
Nothing.

17:00.233 --> 17:01.433
Nothing on that one.

17:04.700 --> 17:06.533
I might catch fish
and I might not.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.400
But I won't know
if I don't try.

17:19.967 --> 17:23.100
I haven't gotten any fish yet,
but that's not surprising.

17:23.133 --> 17:25.133
It takes a lot of patience
to find food out here,

17:25.167 --> 17:26.433
it's really hungry country.

17:30.500 --> 17:31.500
Nothing.

17:34.100 --> 17:35.567
This is the last hole.

17:38.733 --> 17:40.633
Nope, no fish.

17:40.667 --> 17:44.400
I have caught fish here
at this time of year before
so I'm still optimistic.

17:44.433 --> 17:45.700
I'll put it back in.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.767
I'm gonna leave
all of these in overnight.

17:51.533 --> 17:53.433
Come back
and check again tomorrow.

17:56.433 --> 17:57.867
ANDY: I think everybody
in this world

17:57.900 --> 17:59.800
is just trying to make life
a little better,

17:59.833 --> 18:01.267
or a little easier
for themselves,

18:01.300 --> 18:04.167
a little more comfortable,
and that's our goal too.

18:04.200 --> 18:07.300
We just do it
in a very different place
than most people do.

18:14.467 --> 18:15.767
Haw, haw.

18:15.800 --> 18:19.433
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Whoa.

18:19.467 --> 18:22.500
Good! All right!
That was good.

18:22.533 --> 18:24.500
KATE: Andy's harnessing up
the dogs right now

18:24.533 --> 18:28.300
and we're gonna take this boat
that we left here this fall,

18:28.333 --> 18:32.833
slap the motor in the boat,
and get the dogs to pull it
back up to high ground.

18:32.867 --> 18:35.100
ANDY: My boat
is in jeopardy right now.

18:35.133 --> 18:36.867
Once the river level
starts to come up,

18:36.900 --> 18:39.567
if it overflows
and locks that boat in

18:39.600 --> 18:41.033
I'm pretty much gonna lose it.

18:41.067 --> 18:42.967
This is a pretty valuable
boat to me.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.333
This is my running
in the ice boat

18:45.367 --> 18:47.267
and my real
shallow water boat.

18:58.667 --> 19:01.400
The idea is to hook
these dogs up to this boat

19:01.433 --> 19:03.300
and have them drag it up.

19:03.333 --> 19:05.200
It's just another one of those
things with the dogs,

19:05.233 --> 19:06.800
the more exposure
you give them

19:06.833 --> 19:08.800
for doing different
types of chores,

19:08.833 --> 19:10.533
the more well-rounded
they are,

19:10.567 --> 19:11.867
the more well-rounded
they are

19:11.900 --> 19:12.967
the more things
you can do with them.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.400
Plus, it's good exercise.

19:14.433 --> 19:17.867
And how many people get
to pull boats out with dogs?
(LAUGHS)

19:17.900 --> 19:19.200
Get up here
and hold the dogs

19:19.233 --> 19:20.700
so that they don't
take off, please.

19:21.633 --> 19:22.700
Stay!

19:23.633 --> 19:25.167
I'm pretty good with snow here

19:25.200 --> 19:27.433
but as soon as
I make the turn,

19:27.467 --> 19:31.100
the wind's blown a lot
of the snow off the trail.

19:31.133 --> 19:34.833
When aluminium hits rocks,
it just stops dead.

19:34.867 --> 19:37.500
And it doesn't take much
of a rock to stop a boat

19:37.533 --> 19:39.033
or anything that's aluminium.

19:39.067 --> 19:41.167
They... It's like glue.

19:41.200 --> 19:42.867
Tighten up! Let's go!

19:42.900 --> 19:45.900
Let's go!
Hup, hup, hup, hup! Hup!

19:45.933 --> 19:47.667
Twenty-eight paw power
pulling the boat.

19:49.500 --> 19:50.800
Hup, hup!

19:52.200 --> 19:53.567
Hup, hup, hup, hup!

19:53.600 --> 19:54.900
Come on! Hup, hup, hup.

19:54.933 --> 19:56.400
Come on! Hup, hup, hup.

19:59.367 --> 20:01.367
-KATE: Come on! Let's go!
-(DOGS WHINING)

20:02.033 --> 20:03.467
(ANDY CHUCKLES)

20:03.500 --> 20:06.200
It's a wide boat,
I had it tipped up.

20:06.233 --> 20:08.833
It probably has ice under it,
which doesn't slide good.

20:10.100 --> 20:12.367
And we've got rock
and sand here.

20:12.400 --> 20:15.100
Not good combinations
for sliding something over.

20:15.133 --> 20:16.500
(BARKING)

20:16.533 --> 20:19.833
Let's go! Good, tighten up.
Hup, hup!

20:19.867 --> 20:22.300
Attaboys! Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's go!

20:22.333 --> 20:23.400
Hup, hup, hup.

20:23.433 --> 20:24.867
Hup, hup, hup.

20:24.900 --> 20:29.000
Attaboys! Attaboys! Let's go!
Hup, hup, hup, hup.

20:29.033 --> 20:31.067
Yeah! Good boys!

20:32.067 --> 20:33.067
Whoo-hoo!

20:35.400 --> 20:36.400
Bye!

20:36.833 --> 20:39.067
Whoa! Whoa!

20:39.100 --> 20:42.833
I had the option of using
more dogs to begin with,

20:42.867 --> 20:44.433
but there's no way
once they got it going

20:44.467 --> 20:45.800
I'd be able
to keep up with them.

20:47.033 --> 20:49.333
So it's kind of
a balance between

20:49.367 --> 20:53.300
having enough dog power
and having control.

20:53.333 --> 20:56.800
So, and this job's done
for the day.

20:56.833 --> 20:59.500
This job's done
for the season, actually.

20:59.533 --> 21:03.033
-Yay! Good boy, Cougy.
-Hey, Briggus! Briggus!

21:03.067 --> 21:06.267
Good boy, Cougy,
you like pets, don't you?

21:06.300 --> 21:09.700
SUE: Kavik, to everybody else
maybe it's just a location,

21:09.733 --> 21:12.767
it's a spot on the map,
it's a GPS coordinate.

21:12.800 --> 21:15.500
But I have
an emotional, visceral

21:16.400 --> 21:18.367
relationship with that place.

21:32.633 --> 21:36.767
One of the benefits of driving
this time of the day/night

21:36.800 --> 21:38.733
is most people

21:40.167 --> 21:42.367
would consider this foolhardy

21:43.833 --> 21:47.333
because your vision
is impaired,

21:47.367 --> 21:54.400
but I am battling less
oncoming traffic around me.

21:54.433 --> 21:57.167
For somebody who doesn't drive
but like once a decade,

21:58.100 --> 21:59.300
that's important to me.

21:59.333 --> 22:02.100
I kind of feel like I'm the
only person on the planet.

22:02.133 --> 22:05.533
But, yeah,
I'm still a long ways away
from the brunt of the storm

22:07.767 --> 22:09.367
but visibility is impaired.

22:11.633 --> 22:14.533
NARRATOR:
With a blizzard grounding
all flights out of Fairbanks,

22:14.567 --> 22:18.167
Sue has 48 hours to drive up
the deadly Dalton Highway

22:18.200 --> 22:21.700
to make the only available
flight back to Kavik.

22:29.300 --> 22:31.767
SUE: Kind of shimmying
a bit here.

22:31.800 --> 22:35.700
So we are now
approaching Coldfoot,

22:35.733 --> 22:38.167
which is sort of the
halfway mark up the haul road.

22:38.200 --> 22:39.500
Maybe a little bit more
than half.

22:41.233 --> 22:43.933
I need to get fuel.
It's the one gas station.

22:46.167 --> 22:49.033
You don't really wanna
park the car overnight

22:49.067 --> 22:51.467
if the temps are gonna
get real low

22:51.500 --> 22:55.967
and let that condensation
ice up in your tank.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.500
I made more than 50%
of the journey tonight.

22:58.533 --> 23:01.233
And I think the wise course
of action is fuel up,

23:01.267 --> 23:02.867
kip out for a few hours

23:02.900 --> 23:04.667
and then hit the road
as soon as it's light.

23:04.700 --> 23:07.667
There we go.
The rust princess has food.

23:10.133 --> 23:12.267
I still have no idea

23:12.300 --> 23:14.500
what the part was that
fell off of the vehicle.

23:14.533 --> 23:16.733
But everything seems to be
working all right

23:16.767 --> 23:18.767
so I'm gonna keep risking it.

23:18.800 --> 23:22.700
You know, until it goes
tits up, you're doing good.

23:22.733 --> 23:24.333
So that's where I'm at.

23:29.100 --> 23:30.967
GLENN: In the modern world,
people don't think about

23:31.000 --> 23:32.800
being so patient
to get what they want

23:32.833 --> 23:34.267
because things come
a lot easier.

23:36.633 --> 23:38.700
Out here, things come
with more effort.

23:49.933 --> 23:51.900
(EXHALES)

23:51.933 --> 23:56.367
It's 17 below zero.
Typical for this time
of the year.

23:56.400 --> 23:58.367
I'm gonna go check
my fish lines.

23:59.567 --> 24:01.533
So far I haven't caught
any fish.

24:01.567 --> 24:03.300
I just have to keep looking.

24:05.733 --> 24:08.433
One thing about the way
I live out here is that

24:08.467 --> 24:10.933
it requires a lot of patience.
All of the hunting I do,

24:10.967 --> 24:12.000
the fishing, trapping,

24:12.033 --> 24:14.200
everything, requires
a lot of patience.

24:14.233 --> 24:17.967
It's not uncommon
to expend a lot of effort

24:18.000 --> 24:20.033
and not get
any immediate result.

24:20.067 --> 24:21.500
There have been years
when I've had

24:21.533 --> 24:24.333
lines out in this same area
at this time of year,

24:24.367 --> 24:27.600
same set up and caught fish.
This year I might not.

24:27.633 --> 24:29.533
You never know until you try.

24:32.533 --> 24:33.600
(GLENN SPEAKING)

24:42.333 --> 24:44.333
Yeah. Nothing.

24:44.367 --> 24:46.700
The life out here's spread
really thin over the land.

24:46.733 --> 24:51.500
It's really harsh country
and it can't support
a lot of life.

24:51.533 --> 24:53.367
It doesn't feel like
there's one on there.

24:59.167 --> 25:01.800
When I started
I just had a few inches
of ice,

25:01.833 --> 25:03.333
now it's a foot thick.

25:03.367 --> 25:05.167
That's a huge difference
when I'm chiselling

25:05.200 --> 25:06.933
with a hand chisel
through that ice.

25:06.967 --> 25:08.333
I'm expending
way more calories

25:08.367 --> 25:10.467
than I'm likely to gain
out here.

25:17.667 --> 25:18.800
This is the last hole.

25:21.067 --> 25:22.767
My last chance
to get a fish today.

25:30.800 --> 25:31.900
My last hook.

25:33.300 --> 25:37.167
Doesn't feel like
anything's on it. Nothing.

25:37.200 --> 25:38.900
I didn't catch a single fish.

25:40.867 --> 25:44.167
The ice fishing
is never spectacular out here

25:44.200 --> 25:45.967
but I have caught fish
at this time of year

25:46.000 --> 25:48.967
with the same technique
in the same area.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.667
Right now they're not biting
for whatever reason.

25:50.700 --> 25:51.800
I wouldn't know until I tried.

25:51.833 --> 25:53.833
But now that I've tried
for a couple of days

25:53.867 --> 25:55.567
and checked the lines
and got nothing,

25:55.600 --> 25:57.200
I'm not gonna
keep working at it

25:57.233 --> 25:58.433
because it's just
a waste of energy.

26:01.967 --> 26:04.733
I'm disappointed
I didn't catch any fish

26:04.767 --> 26:07.867
but that just goes
with the territory out here.
It's hungry country.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.533
Things don't always pay off.

26:09.567 --> 26:11.067
You gotta know when it's time
to cut your losses

26:11.100 --> 26:12.567
and move on
to the next project.

26:14.500 --> 26:15.800
CHIP: You're gonna work.

26:15.833 --> 26:18.100
You can do it
smiling or crying
but you're gonna work.

26:18.133 --> 26:21.600
So we put the
fun factor into it all
and I think it really helps.

26:35.133 --> 26:36.567
(WHIRRING)

26:41.733 --> 26:44.633
Well, what I've got here are
a couple sheets of plywood.

26:44.667 --> 26:47.200
The plywood is gonna get
nailed on the outside

26:47.233 --> 26:48.767
of this right here.

26:48.800 --> 26:50.700
NARRATOR:
With winter bearing down,

26:50.733 --> 26:53.967
Chip scrambles
to finish his freight sled.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.267
Basically armouring up a sled
for heavy work.

26:59.700 --> 27:01.233
Giving this thing
some protection because

27:01.267 --> 27:03.367
your sled, especially
if a real heavy weight,

27:03.400 --> 27:05.433
and we don't really have
a road up here that's clear...

27:05.467 --> 27:08.200
You're always hitting ice
and logs,

27:08.233 --> 27:10.733
and snow banks
and all kinds of crazy stuff.

27:10.767 --> 27:14.400
Just plain old, frozen
concrete hard ground.

27:14.433 --> 27:17.467
And this sheet of plywood
gives it some integrity
on the outside.

27:19.067 --> 27:20.767
A lot of times
I get a couple of years
out of a sled.

27:20.800 --> 27:23.367
It will be good for one year
and then I'll have a year
where it's repaired

27:23.400 --> 27:25.467
and then I'll just have a year
where I walk away from it.

27:31.700 --> 27:34.200
There's a division of labour
between men and women.

27:34.233 --> 27:35.733
I'm taking care
of the new freight sled

27:35.767 --> 27:38.667
and my wife is
making a sled bag
out of caribou skins.

27:38.700 --> 27:40.967
It will be windproof,
it will be warm

27:41.000 --> 27:43.433
and it will fit, because
she will make it custom fit.

27:43.467 --> 27:46.700
So right now we're just
threading all the needles

27:46.733 --> 27:50.433
that we're going to be using
since we have two thimbles

27:50.467 --> 27:52.067
and the girls are
looking for theirs.

27:52.100 --> 27:53.533
This is going to be the back.

27:54.467 --> 27:56.033
And it will hang over
like this.

27:56.067 --> 27:59.633
But it will be the other way.
The hair will be towards us.

27:59.667 --> 28:02.000
The more girls that sew
the faster we get done.

28:02.033 --> 28:04.033
It's kind of a large project.

28:04.067 --> 28:07.533
But it's a big skin so
it's not too many stitches.

28:09.933 --> 28:11.800
Carolyn, you know
to tie your knots

28:11.833 --> 28:13.767
every eight to
twelve stitches?

28:13.800 --> 28:16.000
No, but I'm checking it
on Qutan's.

28:16.033 --> 28:17.233
TING: There you go, Mary.

28:17.267 --> 28:19.967
-Oh, you can't thread it?
-MARY: Yeah, yeah. It, um...

28:20.000 --> 28:21.500
AGNES: It's real
important for these girls

28:21.533 --> 28:22.833
to learn how to sew.

28:22.867 --> 28:25.167
It was real important
that I learned to sew

28:25.200 --> 28:27.000
that I can pass this on
to my girls.

28:27.033 --> 28:28.767
And hopefully
they'll be able

28:28.800 --> 28:31.733
to pass it on
to their daughters.

28:31.767 --> 28:33.867
I always sew from
the top to the bottom.

28:33.900 --> 28:35.100
You always sew
from the bottom.

28:35.133 --> 28:36.800
-That's how I always sew.
-Like this, this, yeah?

28:36.833 --> 28:39.067
From the top to the bottom.
From the top to the bottom.

28:39.100 --> 28:40.867
-IDI: You guys
go to your hand?
-I always go like this.

28:40.900 --> 28:42.800
Yeah, I always go to my hand.

28:42.833 --> 28:46.300
It's good to know that
these girls can easily know

28:46.333 --> 28:48.600
what I'm trying to do
and then just jump right in

28:48.633 --> 28:51.133
and help me
work on a project
and just get it done.

28:56.800 --> 28:58.733
SUE: You're getting by in life
or you're living your life.

28:58.767 --> 29:00.900
I mean, what are you going
to be proactive about?

29:00.933 --> 29:04.233
A couch potato doesn't take
a lot of proactive energy

29:04.267 --> 29:07.333
but surviving in
100 degrees below zero does.

29:22.933 --> 29:25.167
Day two on the road.
Kipped out overnight.

29:25.200 --> 29:27.433
You know, I just...
The conditions on the road

29:27.467 --> 29:30.167
were such that going up
the pass and hitting that

29:30.200 --> 29:33.867
bad storm,
no road maintenance.
I wasn't into it.

29:33.900 --> 29:37.200
It was late. I needed to
get fuel, get a little rest.

29:38.467 --> 29:40.667
I've got some mountain passes
to go through

29:40.700 --> 29:43.100
that are just
notorious killers.

29:43.133 --> 29:45.633
NARRATOR: Sue is
halfway to Prudhoe Bay.

29:45.667 --> 29:48.967
Once there, she'll hook up
with a bush pilot
and fly to Kavik.

29:49.000 --> 29:53.233
But first, she must navigate
the deadliest section
of the Dalton Highway.

29:54.733 --> 29:57.200
Looks like he's gonna take
your freakin' head off.

29:57.233 --> 29:59.633
I'm looking at the road
and I'm thinking,

29:59.667 --> 30:01.633
"How the hell am I supposed
to tell what my side is

30:01.667 --> 30:04.467
"without getting sucked off
in the ditch?" Hey, buddy.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.733
The road, it's theoretically
two semi loads wide.

30:11.933 --> 30:13.867
I can't see that.

30:13.900 --> 30:16.467
There's a tendency
just to drive in the centre.

30:17.767 --> 30:19.167
So, like you see
that dude doing.

30:19.200 --> 30:20.700
He's driving down
the centre of the road.

30:20.733 --> 30:25.167
So you end up with like one
semi load and a bit wide.

30:25.200 --> 30:26.433
So when
another truck's coming,

30:26.467 --> 30:29.633
I've got to pull off
into the snowfield.

30:29.667 --> 30:31.000
And I know
there's a ditch there

30:31.033 --> 30:32.533
and I don't want to get
sucked into it.

30:32.567 --> 30:34.067
'Cause that's what happens,
is you go off,

30:34.100 --> 30:35.867
you hit the soft, and
you're just sucked right in.

30:38.867 --> 30:42.500
We are now officially
on the north slope of Alaska.

30:42.533 --> 30:46.633
This road way up ahead,
that's Atigun Pass.

30:47.667 --> 30:51.367
And it is one mean,

30:51.400 --> 30:52.867
dicey little section of road.

30:52.900 --> 30:56.133
It's just a thin road
chopped into the hill.

30:56.167 --> 30:59.033
But on one side or the other,
generally you've got a lot of

30:59.067 --> 31:01.567
thousand-foot drops.

31:01.600 --> 31:06.667
So, you know, they try to
plough it, but for me

31:06.700 --> 31:10.967
it's a little intimidating.
Yeah, it's a little sketchy.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.633
It's a little icy
through this portion.

31:14.667 --> 31:18.533
Is Susie scared
of much in life?
This is a little spooky.

31:24.333 --> 31:27.100
This is a serious stretch
of road, man.

31:27.133 --> 31:29.267
Yeah, you're not making me go
too far over the edge, pal,

31:29.300 --> 31:31.867
-we've got to share the road.
Are you fucking kidding me?
-(TRUCK HORN HONKING)

31:36.433 --> 31:38.800
Okay. What happened,
I tried pulling over

31:40.000 --> 31:43.433
and that soft shoulder
sucked me in.

31:43.467 --> 31:46.700
It's not very far over
on that shoulder and
you get sucked in.

31:47.767 --> 31:49.067
I know they have
the right of way

31:49.100 --> 31:51.133
but do they have to be
so big about it?

31:51.167 --> 31:53.733
You know, the trucks passing
do make me nervous.

31:53.767 --> 31:58.100
At Kavik, there's nothing
out there charging at me

31:58.133 --> 32:00.933
except things
that aren't very good. So...

32:00.967 --> 32:04.167
It's kind of nerve racking
having people come at you.

32:17.367 --> 32:20.167
Okay, if you didn't have
those reflectors there,

32:21.100 --> 32:23.700
you tell me how
you're finding the road.

32:23.733 --> 32:25.867
Fuck. Seriously?

32:25.900 --> 32:28.400
I can't tell where the edge
of the fucking road is.

32:31.933 --> 32:35.033
Talk about your comfort zone
going down to zero.

32:37.600 --> 32:39.000
Would be a hell of a time
for whatever part

32:39.033 --> 32:41.267
it was that fell off
to become necessary.

32:45.633 --> 32:47.267
(SUE SPEAKING)

32:52.000 --> 32:57.500
So I made my destina...
Well, I'm not at my final
destination yet.

32:58.333 --> 33:00.300
But I made it to Prudhoe.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
Um...

33:02.800 --> 33:06.500
Plan of action is to...

33:06.533 --> 33:09.833
Ermie hasn't pottied
in the last 150 miles

33:09.867 --> 33:11.600
so she needs
to do her business.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.533
Come on, Erms.

33:15.567 --> 33:17.567
My goal's been achieved
this far.

33:17.600 --> 33:20.000
I'm here. I'm safe.
I'm tired.

33:20.733 --> 33:22.967
Come on, get in.

33:25.600 --> 33:28.200
And it's time to get to bed.

33:28.233 --> 33:29.333
Kavik, next stop.

33:30.900 --> 33:33.533
CHIP: A long time ago,
possessions were
a burden, literally,

33:33.567 --> 33:35.200
because you carried
everything you owned.

33:35.233 --> 33:37.267
And if those folks could live
with everything they owned

33:37.300 --> 33:39.733
able to be on their back,
so can we.

33:39.767 --> 33:42.033
You can do so well
with so little, it's crazy.

33:49.667 --> 33:53.000
Right here I'm putting
on screws to tack this down.

33:53.033 --> 33:54.367
NARRATOR: Chip puts
the finishing touches

33:54.400 --> 33:56.067
on his new freight sled.

33:56.100 --> 33:59.000
Soon, the Hailstones will
use their sled to travel

33:59.033 --> 34:02.833
to distant places to hunt,
fish, and trade.

34:02.867 --> 34:04.800
We waited about three weeks
for the lumber.

34:04.833 --> 34:07.600
We ordered it and then it got
stored while we waited for

34:07.633 --> 34:09.933
availability in a cargo plane
for it to come.

34:09.967 --> 34:13.133
And then it finally did
show up after a couple of days
and we were pretty happy.

34:17.233 --> 34:18.767
Well, my runners
are on straight.

34:18.800 --> 34:20.733
My wife and me have been
working on the sleds,

34:20.767 --> 34:22.233
getting ready for dark winter
to come.

34:22.267 --> 34:25.533
And she's made
a caribou skin bag
that is specifically made

34:25.567 --> 34:28.733
for our basket sled
for the girls to travel in
safely and warmly.

34:28.767 --> 34:30.367
AGNES: Watch out, Qutan,
Irene, while we put this.

34:30.400 --> 34:31.533
QUTAN: That's for loads, that.

34:32.767 --> 34:34.467
AGNES: Ah, it almost
dried too much.

34:34.500 --> 34:36.667

so I get to sit in it.

34:37.867 --> 34:40.233
Wow, I really like it.
It's just right sled.

34:40.267 --> 34:42.900
It's not too big
and not too small.

34:42.933 --> 34:44.833
It's the exact same type
of sled I've built

34:44.867 --> 34:47.333
-for about 20 years
in a row now.
-(CHUCKLES)

34:47.367 --> 34:50.267
So, yeah. Same measurement,
same look.

34:50.300 --> 34:54.033
Same height. Same parts.
Same pattern. Same design.

34:54.067 --> 34:55.200
CAROL: Dad?
CHIP: I think I've
accomplished it

34:55.233 --> 34:57.600
one more time. If you want it,
you make it yourself

34:57.633 --> 35:00.000
or you wait
a long time to get it,
or you just do without.

35:05.433 --> 35:07.833
AGNES: It feels real good
to have the caribou pad
on the sled

35:07.867 --> 35:10.033
and the kids riding in it.

35:10.067 --> 35:11.967
Now they understand
what it was all about

35:12.000 --> 35:13.700
and what process we take
to make it.

35:15.767 --> 35:18.867
CHIP: Well, this has been
a pretty good fall.
It's a pretty normal fall.

35:18.900 --> 35:20.400
We got the projects
we usually take care of

35:20.433 --> 35:22.033
at this time of year
taken care of.

35:22.067 --> 35:25.100
Now, freeze up is almost over,
the ice is a foot thick

35:25.133 --> 35:26.500
and people can make it
to Kotzebue

35:26.533 --> 35:28.967
and make it to Selawik,
and make it to Kiana.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.533
We can go places.
So it's time to bust loose,

35:31.567 --> 35:33.233
we're not stuck
at home any more.

35:33.267 --> 35:34.833
Freeze up's just about done.

35:41.633 --> 35:43.567
ANDY: Everybody does it
different out here.

35:43.600 --> 35:46.333
Everybody's got to find
their own methodology,

35:46.367 --> 35:49.933
their own equilibrium, and
their own bush economics.

36:07.300 --> 36:09.233
The challenge for me
this time of year

36:09.267 --> 36:11.833
is getting the miles on the
dogs early in the season.

36:11.867 --> 36:14.067
My rule of thumb is dogs
aren't really in shape

36:14.100 --> 36:16.300
until you get to about
1,000 miles on them.

36:16.333 --> 36:18.800
I need to be able to run
15 or 20 miles a day

36:18.833 --> 36:21.067
to really start getting
the dogs in shape.

36:21.100 --> 36:22.133
Okay, let's go!

36:30.867 --> 36:33.800
Given the current condition
of the Yukon River,

36:33.833 --> 36:36.933
it's gonna be even more
important for me to get trails

36:36.967 --> 36:40.533
in new places where I can run.

36:40.567 --> 36:44.167
Nice and easy
down the hill, guys.
Nice and easy.

36:44.200 --> 36:46.667
Nice and easy.
Nice and easy.

36:46.700 --> 36:49.367
Attaboys. Nice and easy.
Good boys.

36:49.400 --> 36:52.833
This is kind
of an exploratory trip.
I have no idea how...

36:52.867 --> 36:54.567
What I'm gonna
run up against here.

36:56.467 --> 36:57.533
Oh, shit.

37:00.333 --> 37:04.333
Ah! Okay.
Straight ahead, boys.

37:04.367 --> 37:06.900
Whoa! All right, time
for some chain sawing.

37:07.667 --> 37:08.833
(CHAINSAW WHIRRING)

37:12.533 --> 37:15.233
The last thing I want
to do is get slapped
in the face or bust my sled.

37:15.267 --> 37:18.033
So I'm gonna do a little bit
of cutting here and clear

37:18.067 --> 37:19.600
some of this brush
out of the trail.

37:20.433 --> 37:22.933
A never-ending job out here.

37:22.967 --> 37:25.867
I like taking the time to cut
trails out and make them good.

37:26.633 --> 37:28.700
Everybody tries
to do their part

37:28.733 --> 37:30.633
locally to maintain trails.

37:30.667 --> 37:33.467
And this is close to home
and I'm gonna use it

37:33.500 --> 37:35.000
so I'm the one
who's got to cut it out.

37:37.367 --> 37:39.333
I think we're good
for a little bit here.

Hey!

37:48.500 --> 37:50.867
All right, enough of that.

37:50.900 --> 37:54.233
I just had a little bit
of a tussle between
Cougaran and Shilling here.

37:54.267 --> 37:56.533
They're both brothers but
sometimes they just kind of

37:56.567 --> 37:58.900
bump into each other,
the other one gets pissed off

37:58.933 --> 38:00.867
and they get into
a little bit of a thing.

38:00.900 --> 38:03.067
Just a little bit of a tussle
between two brothers.

38:03.100 --> 38:06.633
They don't wanna
stand around in harness.
They wanna work.

38:11.533 --> 38:14.033
There's no better match in
this country than getting out

38:14.067 --> 38:17.033
and living out in the bush
and having good dogs with you.

38:17.833 --> 38:19.133
They're great companions.

38:19.167 --> 38:21.667
They just lift my heart
whenever I'm around them.

38:21.700 --> 38:23.000
They're always
wagging their tail

38:23.033 --> 38:24.467
and they're happy to see you.

38:24.500 --> 38:26.767
That just puts a smile
on my face.

38:26.800 --> 38:29.800
Attaboy.
Straight ahead. Good.

38:29.833 --> 38:31.700
Straight ahead.
Straight across.

Haw, haw. Haw, haw.

38:34.067 --> 38:35.633
Haw, haw.

38:35.667 --> 38:36.667
Good.

38:37.933 --> 38:39.300
Whoa. Whoa.

38:42.567 --> 38:45.067
Well, I think I'm at
a dead end here.

38:45.100 --> 38:47.233
I'm really, really nervous
when I get on these rivers

38:47.267 --> 38:49.467
and I see this
open water like this.

38:54.200 --> 38:56.533
That's why I don't
wanna go here.

38:56.567 --> 38:59.700
This is dangerous stuff.
Some of this water is deep,

38:59.733 --> 39:02.633
some of it shallow,
but it's all fast.

39:02.667 --> 39:05.767
I'm out there by myself,
so something happens,

39:05.800 --> 39:07.467
I'm pretty much toast.

39:07.500 --> 39:09.700
There's nobody to come out
and help me out there.

39:09.733 --> 39:11.400
I don't think
I wanna continue on here.

39:11.433 --> 39:14.500
I think this is a...
It's not worth the risk.

39:14.533 --> 39:15.767
I don't wanna go here
with the dogs,

39:15.800 --> 39:18.600
I don't wanna come this way
with the snow machine later.

39:18.633 --> 39:21.300
I'm gonna have to wait for
some 20, 30 below temperatures

39:21.333 --> 39:23.533
to start getting
this all to freeze up

39:23.567 --> 39:26.100
before I think it's safe
to go in this area.

39:28.733 --> 39:31.167
Got a dead end, boys.

39:31.200 --> 39:34.000
You guys are all good dogs,
that was good trail-breaking.

39:34.033 --> 39:37.567
Hit a dead end, but it's
a good day's adventure.

39:37.600 --> 39:39.700
Dogs had a ball
breaking the trail out.

39:39.733 --> 39:41.300
It was good training for them.

39:41.333 --> 39:42.900
Hey! Let's go! Let's go!

39:42.933 --> 39:45.633
Any day you come back from
a good, fun dog mushing trip

39:45.667 --> 39:49.733
and all the dogs
are wagging their tails,
it's been a good day.

39:52.833 --> 39:55.433
SUE: I try to be a good person
every single day,

39:55.467 --> 39:57.500
I try to giggle
more than I cry

39:57.533 --> 40:00.067
and I have the inquisitiveness
of a 5-year-old.

40:00.100 --> 40:03.667
I see no reason
to graduate kindergarten.
I get snacks and naps.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.767
It's the last little leg.
It's the last leg and you get

40:22.800 --> 40:25.400
to go home and see
your little Slinky friend.

40:27.467 --> 40:29.467
The winds have died down
considerably

40:29.500 --> 40:31.400
so we're gonna go ahead
and make a stab at it,

40:31.433 --> 40:32.700
try to get into Kavik,

40:32.733 --> 40:34.700
see what is or isn't
happening out there,

40:34.733 --> 40:36.900
how it rode the storm.
If it's there.

40:36.933 --> 40:38.733
Hopefully I've got
a camp standing

40:38.767 --> 40:41.500
and there's just a few
erroneous things
that happened.

40:41.533 --> 40:42.967
You know, small problems.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.533
But I won't know
until I get there.

41:11.867 --> 41:12.933
Okay.

41:12.967 --> 41:14.100
SUE: A storm like this,
I mean,

41:14.133 --> 41:16.467
I could have all my
buildings gone, they're tents.

41:16.500 --> 41:20.200
The trailers will be there
but my tents, my shop,
my storage closet,

41:20.233 --> 41:22.900
the Twinkie, the dining hall,
that may be compromised.

41:22.933 --> 41:25.867
And landing is kind of
a goofy deal.

41:25.900 --> 41:27.567
I'm not there maintaining
the runway.

41:27.600 --> 41:30.467
When I can't maintain it,
I can't tell you how it is
for landing.

42:10.400 --> 42:13.000
I do have some drifting
and a lot of snow piled up,

42:13.033 --> 42:15.933
but my buildings are up and
that is first and foremost.

42:15.967 --> 42:18.667
Come on, Ermie!
Where are you?

42:18.700 --> 42:22.500
It's your home! You are home!

Just a lot of hecticness
that I'm not used to,

42:26.933 --> 42:30.067
just trying to get in.
It feels like I've been...

42:30.100 --> 42:33.400
Well, I have been trying
for the last friggin' week
to get in here.

42:34.467 --> 42:35.900
Definitely a stress ball.

42:36.700 --> 42:38.233
Way better here
than I thought.

42:38.267 --> 42:41.533
It must have just been at that
30-mile point right there.

42:42.800 --> 42:44.900
Just like it was driving up.

42:44.933 --> 42:47.900
I mean, it was beautiful
until you hit that
30-mile wall

42:47.933 --> 42:49.500
and then it was all hell.

42:49.533 --> 42:52.400
-Well, I'm going back into it.
-Well, fly safe.

42:52.433 --> 42:53.900
-See you later.
-All right, you big...

42:53.933 --> 42:58.067
Feels good to be home and now
I can get back to the business

42:58.100 --> 42:59.633
of being Kavik.
