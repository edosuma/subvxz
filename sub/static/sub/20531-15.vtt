GIORGIO A. TSOUKALOS:
Archaeologists discovered

00:05.210 --> 00:07.920
cave systems in China.

00:07.920 --> 00:12.170
Inside those caves,
they found hundreds

00:12.170 --> 00:14.260
of these round disks

00:14.260 --> 00:17.550
that contained
these bizarre grooves

00:17.550 --> 00:19.720
with strange writing on them.

00:21.730 --> 00:25.190
All over the world,
you find ancient depictions

00:25.190 --> 00:26.940
of disks.

00:26.940 --> 00:29.730
Not only depictions,

00:29.730 --> 00:33.820
but they also occur
as actual artifacts.

00:33.820 --> 00:36.740
DAVID CHILDRESS: Local legend
says that the sun disk

00:36.740 --> 00:39.790
was transported
through these tunnels

00:39.790 --> 00:42.700
to some unknown destination.

00:42.700 --> 00:45.250
WILLIAM HENRY: The disk could
actually be some method

00:45.250 --> 00:48.250
of communicating
with the god himself.

00:48.250 --> 00:50.250
Sort of a god button

00:50.250 --> 00:54.260
that the ancient civilizations
could push

00:54.260 --> 00:57.510
and be able to connect
with the gods.

00:57.510 --> 01:01.720
NICK REDFERN: Maybe the disks
themselves are extraterrestrial,

01:01.720 --> 01:04.520
or they're imbued
with some sort of

01:04.520 --> 01:06.940
extraterrestrial intelligence.

01:08.360 --> 01:10.270
♪ ♪

01:40.220 --> 01:46.350
NARRATOR: The Baian‐Kara‐Ula
mountain range, China, 1938.

01:46.350 --> 01:49.980
While trekking
through the rugged terrain,

01:49.980 --> 01:53.780
an archaeologist from
Beijing University and his team

01:53.780 --> 01:57.570
discover what appears
to be man‐made caves.

01:57.570 --> 02:01.030
TSOUKALOS:
Archaeologists discovered

02:01.030 --> 02:03.040
cave systems in China

02:03.040 --> 02:08.960
that contained the skeletons
of very short, spindly creatures

02:08.960 --> 02:11.380
with giant heads.

02:11.380 --> 02:14.050
They also found petroglyphs

02:14.050 --> 02:17.510
and cave paintings
of the solar system.

02:17.510 --> 02:20.430
And inside those caves,

02:20.430 --> 02:25.180
they also found hundreds
of these round disks

02:25.180 --> 02:28.520
that contained
these bizarre grooves

02:28.520 --> 02:30.600
with strange writing on them.

02:30.600 --> 02:32.400
NARRATOR:
According to an article

02:32.400 --> 02:36.940
published in a German magazine
in July 1962,

02:36.940 --> 02:40.410
entitled
"UFOs in Prehistoric Times,"

02:40.410 --> 02:43.490
archaeologists unearthed 716

02:43.490 --> 02:46.660
of these disk‐shaped objects
from the caves,

02:46.660 --> 02:49.750
later termed Dropa stones.

02:49.750 --> 02:52.790
Each stone had a small hole
in the center,

02:52.790 --> 02:55.880
measured roughly
a foot in diameter,

02:55.880 --> 02:59.220
and had grooves containing
microscopic inscriptions.

02:59.220 --> 03:00.930
The team from Beijing

03:00.930 --> 03:05.350
dated the Dropa stones
to roughly 10000 BC,

03:05.350 --> 03:08.770
based on the skeletal remains
found at the site.

03:08.770 --> 03:10.850
But their purpose
remained a mystery

03:10.850 --> 03:13.480
for more than two decades,

03:13.480 --> 03:17.690
until a Chinese archaeologist
claimed to have deciphered them.

03:19.700 --> 03:22.070
When the disks
were closely examined,

03:22.070 --> 03:24.740
they discovered that within the
grooves were tiny hieroglyphs

03:24.740 --> 03:26.410
that were so tiny,

03:26.410 --> 03:28.660
they could only be seen
with a magnifying glass.

03:28.660 --> 03:30.960
When they were
finally deciphered,

03:30.960 --> 03:33.290
they told this amazing story.

03:33.290 --> 03:35.540
They tell the story
of the Dropa,

03:35.540 --> 03:38.800
tiny extraterrestrial
or dwarf‐like beings.

03:38.800 --> 03:40.300
HARTWIG HAUSDORF:
Those hieroglyphs

03:40.300 --> 03:44.220
told about the crash landing
of some people

03:44.220 --> 03:47.140
that flew through the universe

03:47.140 --> 03:51.730
and came upon the third planet
of our solar system.

03:51.730 --> 03:55.520
And when they crash landed
in this remote mountain area,

03:55.520 --> 03:57.320
they had no possibility

03:57.320 --> 04:03.030
to repair their spacecraft
and had to stay there.

04:03.030 --> 04:07.490
The Chinese Academy
of the Sciences

04:07.490 --> 04:10.330
forbid
the Chinese archaeologist,

04:10.330 --> 04:12.620
named Tsum Um Nui, to, uh,

04:12.620 --> 04:14.830
publish what he found out.

04:14.830 --> 04:19.130
But he succeeded
in publishing the story,

04:19.130 --> 04:22.380
and when it came
to our Western states,

04:22.380 --> 04:26.600
it was received as, well,
some kind of science fiction.

04:26.600 --> 04:30.470
No one believed the story.

04:30.470 --> 04:32.350
NARRATOR:
Shortly after the article

04:32.350 --> 04:35.060
about the Dropa Stones
was published,

04:35.060 --> 04:38.150
the Chinese government
confiscated the disks

04:38.150 --> 04:41.610
and quickly dismissed
their existence as a hoax.

04:41.610 --> 04:44.070
But was it?

04:44.070 --> 04:46.570
TSOUKALOS: An interesting aspect
about the Dropa stones

04:46.570 --> 04:48.620
is that, today,

04:48.620 --> 04:51.700
none of these disks
exist publicly.

04:51.700 --> 04:54.210
So, that means, at some point,

04:54.210 --> 04:57.630
these disks were put away
by museums,

04:57.630 --> 05:00.670
by archaeologists, who knows?

05:00.670 --> 05:04.840
Any and all trace
of these disks is gone.

05:04.840 --> 05:09.390
So one has to wonder:
"What was up with these disks?"

05:09.390 --> 05:12.770
Because if they were
just ordinary artifacts,

05:12.770 --> 05:15.730
then they would be
displayed at museums.

05:15.730 --> 05:18.360
What if we have another example

05:18.360 --> 05:21.860
of where archaeologists
are afraid

05:21.860 --> 05:23.940
to investigate something,

05:23.940 --> 05:27.820
just because the inscription
on there reads

05:27.820 --> 05:31.240
there was an extraterrestrial
visitation?

05:31.240 --> 05:33.950
NARRATOR: Years after
the Dropa stones disappeared

05:33.950 --> 05:35.620
from the public sphere,

05:35.620 --> 05:39.130
evidence of a mysterious
short‐statured population

05:39.130 --> 05:43.170
known as the Dzopa
was discovered in the area.

05:43.170 --> 05:45.590
This would seem
to add further credence

05:45.590 --> 05:48.430
to the Beijing archaeologists'
report,

05:48.430 --> 05:51.100
in which they stated
that they had come across

05:51.100 --> 05:54.100
three‐foot‐tall
human‐like skeletons

05:54.100 --> 05:57.890
in the caves that contained
the Dropa stones.

05:57.890 --> 06:00.650
Since the Chinese government
took control of these disks,

06:00.650 --> 06:02.480
we're at a loss
for more knowledge

06:02.480 --> 06:04.940
about who the Dropa
actually were.

06:04.940 --> 06:07.950
But the reason why we should
pay attention to the Dropa story

06:07.950 --> 06:10.070
is because in 1995,

06:10.070 --> 06:12.990
it was discovered
that there was a group of people

06:12.990 --> 06:15.040
living very near
the Dropa crash.

06:15.040 --> 06:19.210
The tallest person in this group
was three‐foot, ten inches tall,

06:19.210 --> 06:24.000
matching identically the
description of the Dropa beings.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.670
Because this tribe matched
the description of the Dropa,

06:27.670 --> 06:31.140
one wonders, are they actual
descendants of the Dropa beings?

06:34.010 --> 06:35.720
NARRATOR:
If the published account

06:35.720 --> 06:37.600
of the Dropa disks is true,

06:37.600 --> 06:43.020
is this evidence
of an alien technology on Earth?

06:43.020 --> 06:45.570
References
to disk‐shaped artifacts

06:45.570 --> 06:48.530
associated
with otherworldly beings

06:48.530 --> 06:51.700
can be found
throughout human history.

06:51.700 --> 06:55.540
All over the world‐‐ it doesn't
matter on what continent‐‐

06:55.540 --> 06:59.620
you find ancient depictions
of disks.

06:59.620 --> 07:05.340
Not only depictions, but they
also occur as actual artifacts.

07:05.340 --> 07:07.880
Disks are everywhere
in ancient imagery,

07:07.880 --> 07:11.470
connected with extraterrestrials
or celestial beings.

07:11.470 --> 07:14.300
In Christian art,
we'll see disks in the sky

07:14.300 --> 07:17.770
that appear to be
like craft or UFOs.

07:17.770 --> 07:21.310
The Chinese portrayed their gods
flying in disks.

07:21.310 --> 07:24.020
You will see saints with halos,

07:24.020 --> 07:26.690
and it symbolizes
expanded consciousness

07:26.690 --> 07:28.990
and connection to other realms.

07:28.990 --> 07:32.910
The Egyptians had golden disks
on their heads as well.

07:32.910 --> 07:35.450
When we see these disks,
it always symbolizes

07:35.450 --> 07:38.660
their connection
to otherworldly realms.

07:38.660 --> 07:42.330
Disks have found themselves
as central artifacts

07:42.330 --> 07:45.170
within every ancient culture.

07:45.170 --> 07:49.550
Disks were seen as points of
communication with the divine.

07:49.550 --> 07:53.800
Disks were revered as being
that point of connection

07:53.800 --> 07:55.720
with their creator gods.

07:55.720 --> 07:59.560
When we look at the almost
universal presence

07:59.560 --> 08:02.060
of this disk shape
in so many ancient cultures,

08:02.060 --> 08:04.100
we're seeing something
that defies

08:04.100 --> 08:08.860
the common idea of it
just being a useless artifact.

08:08.860 --> 08:10.900
It is an archetype.

08:10.900 --> 08:14.410
It is a consistent motif that
shows up over and over again,

08:14.410 --> 08:17.030
and we need to investigate
the possibility

08:17.030 --> 08:19.950
that there is some actual
message contained within them.

08:21.370 --> 08:23.040
NARRATOR:
Is there a connection

08:23.040 --> 08:24.670
between the Dropa stones

08:24.670 --> 08:27.630
reportedly found
in the mountains of China,

08:27.630 --> 08:30.510
and disk‐shaped artifacts
written about

08:30.510 --> 08:33.720
by ancient cultures
all around the world?

08:33.720 --> 08:38.760
And if so, were they left here
by extraterrestrial visitors,

08:38.760 --> 08:43.440
with a purpose mankind
has yet to discover?

08:43.440 --> 08:46.350
Perhaps further clues
can be found

08:46.350 --> 08:48.730
by examining ancient disks

08:48.730 --> 08:51.820
that were believed to hold
the power to communicate

08:51.820 --> 08:53.990
with the gods.

09:00.740 --> 09:05.250
NARRATOR:
Phaistos, Crete, 1908.

09:05.250 --> 09:09.630
While exploring the ruins
of an ancient Minoan palace

09:09.630 --> 09:12.670
dating to the 17th century BC,

09:12.670 --> 09:16.130
Italian archaeologist
Luigi Pernier

09:16.130 --> 09:20.220
unearths a clay disk
with strange writing on it.

09:20.220 --> 09:24.020
More than 100 years
after its discovery,

09:24.020 --> 09:29.060
researchers are still unsure who
created this mysterious disk,

09:29.060 --> 09:33.650
what its purpose was, or what
the symbols on it might mean.

09:33.650 --> 09:36.780
The Phaistos Disk is interesting

09:36.780 --> 09:39.620
because of what we don't know,
in a sense.

09:39.620 --> 09:42.620
What we do know is that it
came from the Phaistos Temple,

09:42.620 --> 09:45.580
which is a Minoan temple,
and we really wish we did know

09:45.580 --> 09:48.040
more about what
Minoan civilization was,

09:48.040 --> 09:50.170
what their writing was,
what their culture was.

09:50.170 --> 09:53.670
It in itself
is a very mysterious culture.

09:53.670 --> 09:56.630
And then the disk
adds another layer of mystery.

09:56.630 --> 09:58.510
Here it was in one
of their main temples,

09:58.510 --> 10:00.220
and yet it doesn't
bear resemblance

10:00.220 --> 10:02.510
to anything we've seen
from Minoan civilization.

10:02.510 --> 10:04.720
So did this come
from a very, very early time?

10:04.720 --> 10:07.770
Was it brought in from
an outsider group at some point

10:07.770 --> 10:10.270
that was considered
significant and sacred enough

10:10.270 --> 10:12.400
to put in a temple?

10:12.400 --> 10:14.360
There isn't a scholar
on this planet

10:14.360 --> 10:18.150
that can tell you where the
Phaistos Disk originated from.

10:18.150 --> 10:23.030
The clay the disk has been
made from is not Minoan.

10:23.030 --> 10:28.000
Nobody knows the origins of the
language on the Phaistos Disk.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.210
It doesn't match ancient Minoan.

10:31.380 --> 10:34.550
Now, over the last 100 years,

10:34.550 --> 10:37.970
there's been
40 failed academic attempts

10:37.970 --> 10:39.380
to decode or to discover

10:39.380 --> 10:42.800
the true language
of the Phaistos Disk.

10:42.800 --> 10:47.980
It wasn't until 2008, professors
from the University of Crete

10:47.980 --> 10:51.520
and the University of Oxford
deciphered the first phrase,

10:51.520 --> 10:57.030
which was, "The mother goddess
from beyond."

10:57.030 --> 11:00.660
They can see the patterns within
the structure of the language.

11:00.660 --> 11:04.530
But they all admit
they can understand

11:04.530 --> 11:07.700
100% of nothing.

11:07.700 --> 11:10.750
The Phaistos Disk

11:10.750 --> 11:14.380
is written in these
curious hieroglyphics.

11:14.380 --> 11:18.970
They include pictures of men
with Mohawks, different designs.

11:18.970 --> 11:23.970
Even one of the figures
looks like a flying saucer.

11:23.970 --> 11:27.270
While the Phaistos Disk
was discovered in Crete,

11:27.270 --> 11:29.850
we know that the script on it
is not Minoan.

11:29.850 --> 11:33.900
It's believed to be made
with moveable type,

11:33.900 --> 11:37.320
which wasn't invented
for another 1,500 years.

11:37.320 --> 11:39.070
This opens up the possibility

11:39.070 --> 11:41.280
that the Minoans
must have been in contact

11:41.280 --> 11:45.280
with some advanced beings, maybe
even extraterrestrials who,

11:45.280 --> 11:48.370
in fact, created the disk
as a sort of computer disk,

11:48.370 --> 11:50.460
or some kind of
an information disk,

11:50.460 --> 11:54.170
that would be able to be
deciphered at a later date.

11:54.170 --> 11:56.210
According to the ancient
astronaut theory,

11:56.210 --> 11:59.130
the only reason why
ancient relics became sacred

11:59.130 --> 12:02.010
is because of their connection

12:02.010 --> 12:04.680
with someone descending
from the sky.

12:04.680 --> 12:09.520
According to the Minoan
mythologies,

12:09.520 --> 12:13.480
the knowledge that
they garnered, at first,

12:13.480 --> 12:18.480
was given to them by none other
than the Sons of the Skies.

12:18.480 --> 12:22.740
Could it be that the Minoans
were in touch

12:22.740 --> 12:27.660
with advanced beings
visiting them from outer space?

12:27.660 --> 12:30.410
NARRATOR: Could the mysterious
Phaistos Disk

12:30.410 --> 12:34.120
that was found within
a 4,000‐year‐old Minoan palace

12:34.120 --> 12:37.290
be of extraterrestrial origin?

12:37.290 --> 12:40.710
And might it also have a
connection to the Dropa stones

12:40.710 --> 12:42.800
unearthed in China?

12:42.800 --> 12:46.010
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

12:46.010 --> 12:48.760
and suggest further evidence
can be found

12:48.760 --> 12:51.430
by examining another disk

12:51.430 --> 12:56.100
belonging to one of mankind's
earliest known civilizations.

13:01.320 --> 13:05.150
Tell Abu Habbah, Iraq.

13:05.150 --> 13:08.410
In the Iraqi desert,

13:08.410 --> 13:11.240
just 18 miles southwest
of Baghdad,

13:11.240 --> 13:15.420
lie the ruins
of ancient Babylonia.

13:15.420 --> 13:20.920
In 1881, archaeologists
digging at the ancient site

13:20.920 --> 13:24.170
unearthed tens of thousands
of stone tablets

13:24.170 --> 13:28.050
dating back
to the sixth century BC.

13:28.050 --> 13:31.850
Amongst the finds
was a bas‐relief carving

13:31.850 --> 13:35.140
depicting the Mesopotamian
sun god Shamash.

13:38.440 --> 13:41.770
This here is the Babylonian
Tablet of Shamash,

13:41.770 --> 13:44.190
which has this
central disk right here,

13:44.190 --> 13:47.110
with God Shamash right here
and human beings right here.

13:48.780 --> 13:50.740
What's so cool in this depiction

13:50.740 --> 13:53.620
is that Shamash is shown

13:53.620 --> 13:56.540
as if he was some type
of a giant,

13:56.540 --> 13:58.920
'cause he is much, much bigger

13:58.920 --> 14:00.710
than the rest
of the people here.

14:00.710 --> 14:04.420
The enclosure has this

14:04.420 --> 14:07.840
type of a connection
to the cosmos

14:07.840 --> 14:10.220
because you have a depiction

14:10.220 --> 14:15.180
of the Moon, the Sun and Venus.

14:15.180 --> 14:18.600
Now, what I think is
really cool is that up here,

14:18.600 --> 14:20.650
you have this celestial being

14:20.650 --> 14:24.980
that is sort of holding on
to this disk.

14:24.980 --> 14:27.780
The fact that
this celestial being

14:27.780 --> 14:31.120
has these two ropes
attached to this disk

14:31.120 --> 14:34.790
leads me to think about
misunderstood technology.

14:36.950 --> 14:39.080
ASHLEY COWIE:
The sun disk

14:39.080 --> 14:41.000
in the Tablet of Shamash

14:41.000 --> 14:43.340
is described
in the below text as such:

14:43.340 --> 14:46.510
the disk was sent there
or put there

14:46.510 --> 14:49.630
to be worshipped
in place of Shamash.

14:49.630 --> 14:52.050
It was the access point
for the ancient Babylonians

14:52.050 --> 14:54.600
to communicate with their gods,

14:54.600 --> 14:59.520
in particular,
the sun god Shamash.

14:59.520 --> 15:02.980
This could actually be
some method of communicating

15:02.980 --> 15:04.270
with the god himself.

15:04.270 --> 15:07.530
It is some form of a technology.

15:07.530 --> 15:09.780
Think of it as
sort of a god button

15:09.780 --> 15:12.870
that the ancient Babylonians
or Sumerians could push

15:12.870 --> 15:16.660
and be able to connect
with Shamash.

15:16.660 --> 15:19.580
NARRATOR:
If the actual sun disk

15:19.580 --> 15:22.420
depicted on the tablet
is ever found

15:22.420 --> 15:25.040
among the ruins
of ancient Babylonia,

15:25.040 --> 15:29.550
will we discover that it is some
sort of technological device?

15:29.550 --> 15:34.720
Perhaps further clues can be
found by examining the story

15:34.720 --> 15:36.680
of an Incan ruler
who wore a disk

15:36.680 --> 15:41.190
which allowed him to wield
the power of the gods.

15:47.110 --> 15:50.240
NARRATOR:
Cusco, Peru.

15:50.240 --> 15:53.200
Today, the Church
of Santo Domingo

15:53.200 --> 15:55.580
sits on the foundation stones

15:55.580 --> 15:58.540
of what was once considered
the most important temple

15:58.540 --> 16:02.420
to the ancient Inca: the
Coricancha, Temple of the Sun.

16:04.710 --> 16:07.210
The original structure,
which is believed

16:07.210 --> 16:10.050
to predate
the Incan civilization,

16:10.050 --> 16:14.470
was rebuilt in the 15th century
by the ruler, Pachacuti,

16:14.470 --> 16:17.930
after he came into possession
of a mirrored disk.

16:20.520 --> 16:23.140
DR. EDWIN BARNHART
Pachacuti is...

16:23.140 --> 16:28.270
the first Inca who really
created the Inca as an empire,

16:28.270 --> 16:31.360
not just as one of many cultures
in the Andes.

16:33.650 --> 16:36.070
COWIE: A legend has it
that Pachacuti traveled

16:36.070 --> 16:39.580
to a spring to the east
of Cusco.

16:39.580 --> 16:43.250
A disk is said to have fallen
from the sky into the spring.

16:46.960 --> 16:49.630
And when Pachacuti lifted it
out of the water,

16:49.630 --> 16:52.670
he saw an image

16:52.670 --> 16:55.890
of Viracocha, the creator.

16:55.890 --> 16:58.260
The apparition told Pachacuti,

16:58.260 --> 17:01.140
"You will win many wars."

17:01.140 --> 17:04.190
(men shouting)

17:04.190 --> 17:07.610
Within ten years,
Pachacuti expanded the empire

17:07.610 --> 17:10.610
in a way that's never been seen
in history before.

17:10.610 --> 17:11.820
(men shouting)

17:14.400 --> 17:17.160
The myths say that he held
that mirror with him

17:17.160 --> 17:18.780
for the rest of his life

17:18.780 --> 17:21.740
and any answers he wanted
to look into the future

17:21.740 --> 17:24.500
or what to do,
he consulted the mirror

17:24.500 --> 17:26.330
and the mirror told him
what to do.

17:26.330 --> 17:30.000
COWIE:
The disk that Pachacuti found

17:30.000 --> 17:32.380
truly was his key

17:32.380 --> 17:35.130
and his driving force
to become one of the most

17:35.130 --> 17:37.260
powerful emperors in history.

17:37.260 --> 17:41.850
NARRATOR: Pachacuti began the
expansion of the Incan territory

17:41.850 --> 17:43.810
from the valley of Cusco

17:43.810 --> 17:48.810
to encompass 2,500 miles of the
west coast of South America

17:48.810 --> 17:52.480
from Quito, Ecuador
to Talca, Chile.

17:55.900 --> 18:00.120
Worldwide, it doesn't matter
what ancient culture,

18:00.120 --> 18:04.790
there's some type of a worship
of a disk

18:04.790 --> 18:07.960
that came from the sky.

18:07.960 --> 18:11.540
It is possible that this disk

18:11.540 --> 18:15.130
had some type of an
extraterrestrial connection

18:15.130 --> 18:19.760
and that this disk was
a technological device.

18:19.760 --> 18:21.680
CHILDRESS:
You have to wonder,

18:21.680 --> 18:23.930
was it some kind of
extraterrestrial object

18:23.930 --> 18:28.060
that Pachacuti was now carrying
around with him that allowed him

18:28.060 --> 18:30.980
to communicate with these
extraterrestrial gods

18:30.980 --> 18:32.690
that were guiding him?

18:32.690 --> 18:35.690
WILCOCK:
We've already had smartphones

18:35.690 --> 18:37.530
that have come out
in our own history

18:37.530 --> 18:40.410
where it's a lot
more than what it appears.

18:40.410 --> 18:42.620
You're looking
at all of your apps.

18:42.620 --> 18:44.370
You can watch movies on it.
You can send e‐mail.

18:44.370 --> 18:46.450
You can have telephone calls.

18:46.450 --> 18:49.290
You can have video calls,
all kinds of things.

18:49.290 --> 18:53.250
So, that disk may have been
something with a great deal

18:53.250 --> 18:54.920
of computer circuitry in it,

18:54.920 --> 18:58.380
something that had
far more capability

18:58.380 --> 19:00.680
than we could ever
normally imagine.

19:03.470 --> 19:07.640
NARRATOR: If the accounts of
Pachacuti's magic disk are true,

19:07.640 --> 19:11.600
could it have contained some
sort of alien technology?

19:11.600 --> 19:14.980
According to ancient
astronaut theorists,

19:14.980 --> 19:18.490
further evidence that
alien disks exist on Earth

19:18.490 --> 19:23.660
can be found in the Hayu Marca
mountain region of Peru.

19:23.660 --> 19:29.000
At the site known by the locals
as the <i>Puerta de</i> Hayu Marca,

19:29.000 --> 19:30.830
or Gate of the Gods,

19:30.830 --> 19:34.590
is an enormous 23‐foot high
door‐like structure

19:34.590 --> 19:37.800
carved into the solid rock face.

19:37.800 --> 19:41.550
Contained within it
is a smaller T‐shaped opening

19:41.550 --> 19:43.720
just under six feet in height,

19:43.720 --> 19:46.140
with a circular
depression inside.

19:48.220 --> 19:51.390
Local legends tells us
that the gods would use this

19:51.390 --> 19:53.940
as a gateway, or a stargate,

19:53.940 --> 19:55.900
through which they would
come and go.

19:55.900 --> 19:59.860
They opened the doorway through
this disk that was placed

19:59.860 --> 20:04.700
in a little alcove or etching
place inside the doorway.

20:04.700 --> 20:06.700
CHILDRESS:
One of the stories, too,

20:06.700 --> 20:10.120
is that a high priest
named Amaru Meru

20:10.120 --> 20:14.500
utilized a disk
to open this door.

20:14.500 --> 20:18.630
And so this was
his computer or key

20:18.630 --> 20:21.630
that opened this
dimensional doorway.

20:21.630 --> 20:24.470
Once again, the disk is the key.

20:24.470 --> 20:28.600
Here we have an apparent
extraterrestrial technology

20:28.600 --> 20:30.850
in the form of a disk,

20:30.850 --> 20:34.100
and you would then pop the disk
into where the door is

20:34.100 --> 20:36.900
and that would open the portal.

20:36.900 --> 20:41.990
This circular area has been
found where the door is located

20:41.990 --> 20:46.030
and so it does suggest that
there may be some veracity

20:46.030 --> 20:48.280
to these ancient legends.

20:53.580 --> 20:57.000
NARRATOR: Interestingly, the
disk of <i>Puerta de</i> Hayu Marca

20:57.000 --> 21:00.130
and Pachacuti's mirror
are just two

21:00.130 --> 21:03.760
of a number of mysterious disks
that are said to have existed

21:03.760 --> 21:06.640
throughout Central
and South America.

21:08.550 --> 21:11.930
And legend has it that
the very same Coricancha temple

21:11.930 --> 21:13.980
that Pachacuti rebuilt,

21:13.980 --> 21:16.600
housed the empire's
most prized possession:

21:16.600 --> 21:20.440
a golden sun disk.

21:20.440 --> 21:23.440
The artifact
allegedly disappeared

21:23.440 --> 21:27.410
just before the conquistadors,
lead by Francisco Pizarro,

21:27.410 --> 21:30.330
sacked the city
in November of 1533.

21:30.330 --> 21:32.200
(men grunting)

21:32.200 --> 21:35.250
Nearly five centuries later,

21:35.250 --> 21:38.040
in March of 2017,

21:38.040 --> 21:41.710
author and world explorer
David Childress

21:41.710 --> 21:44.010
visited the site
to see the very spot

21:44.010 --> 21:48.970
where the legendary disk
once hung from the wall.

21:48.970 --> 21:53.390
It's thought that this spot
here in the Coricancha temple

21:53.390 --> 21:57.140
is where the seven‐foot wide
sun disk was held.

21:57.140 --> 22:00.110
And a long rope was

22:00.110 --> 22:03.900
fastened through
these many holes,

22:03.900 --> 22:07.110
and it held
the sun disk in place

22:07.110 --> 22:11.450
here in the center of
the Coricancha temple in Cusco.

22:12.990 --> 22:15.160
NARRATOR:
According to Inca legend,

22:15.160 --> 22:20.210
the sun disk had existed since
the birth of human civilization.

22:20.210 --> 22:23.550
They described the artifact
as being made

22:23.550 --> 22:28.510
from a translucent gold material
that came from the heavens.

22:28.510 --> 22:32.260
BARNHART:
The disk was said, by the Inca,

22:32.260 --> 22:35.470
to represent Viracocha,

22:35.470 --> 22:38.230
the creator deity,
the apex deity.

22:38.230 --> 22:39.940
And in point of fact,

22:39.940 --> 22:42.610
just about every culture
in the ancient Andes

22:42.610 --> 22:45.480
also recognized Viracocha,

22:45.480 --> 22:48.360
under various names,
as the creator deity.

22:50.030 --> 22:52.160
COWIE: Legend has it that,
after Viracocha

22:52.160 --> 22:54.450
created the Moon and the Sun,

22:54.450 --> 22:56.620
he created
the first man and woman,

22:56.620 --> 23:00.330
Manco Cápac and Mama Ocllo.

23:00.330 --> 23:02.590
The first thing
Viracocha commanded

23:02.590 --> 23:05.500
Manco Cápac to do on Earth

23:05.500 --> 23:08.590
was create
the Incan golden sun disk.

23:10.260 --> 23:13.350
The sun disk
was an actual manifestation

23:13.350 --> 23:15.600
of the creator on Earth.

23:15.600 --> 23:17.850
They truly believed
it was imbued

23:17.850 --> 23:21.980
with supernatural,
trans‐dimensional forces,

23:21.980 --> 23:23.900
and it was the point
of communication

23:23.900 --> 23:26.280
with the creator himself.

23:26.280 --> 23:29.400
It was like a broadband
connection to Viracocha.

23:32.070 --> 23:37.620
TSOUKALOS: Now, Viracocha
came down from the sky.

23:37.620 --> 23:39.790
Now, is it possible

23:39.790 --> 23:43.630
that it was
a misunderstood flying machine

23:43.630 --> 23:49.210
that our ancestors
thought was God?

23:49.210 --> 23:52.340
And the massive golden disk

23:52.340 --> 23:54.890
attributed to this
extraterrestrial being

23:54.890 --> 23:57.060
allegedly had the power

23:57.060 --> 23:59.220
to heal ailments,

23:59.220 --> 24:03.520
to help shamans reach
a higher plane of consciousness.

24:05.400 --> 24:07.400
CHILDRESS: The Incas believed
that the sun disk

24:07.400 --> 24:11.150
had the power to help them
change the weather

24:11.150 --> 24:14.030
or alter catastrophes.

24:14.030 --> 24:16.740
So if there was a big earthquake

24:16.740 --> 24:19.120
or there were terrible floods,

24:19.120 --> 24:21.460
they believed that they could go
to this sun disk

24:21.460 --> 24:24.580
and ask it for help.

24:25.830 --> 24:27.800
So you have to ask yourself,

24:27.800 --> 24:32.420
was the Inca sun disk some kind
of communication device

24:32.420 --> 24:34.260
with extraterrestrials?

24:36.260 --> 24:39.220
NARRATOR: According to
ancient astronaut theorists,

24:39.220 --> 24:42.020
the fact that the Inca
were so concerned

24:42.020 --> 24:43.890
with keeping the golden sun disk

24:43.890 --> 24:45.810
out of the hands of the Spanish

24:45.810 --> 24:47.690
serves as further evidence

24:47.690 --> 24:51.940
that it truly did
possess otherworldly power.

24:51.940 --> 24:54.030
And many believe

24:54.030 --> 24:56.070
the disk still exists

24:56.070 --> 24:58.170
somewhere on Earth today.

25:05.610 --> 25:08.530
NARRATOR: Outside the ruins
of Saksaywaman,

25:08.530 --> 25:12.240
just a mile and a half from
the Coricancha temple in Cusco,

25:12.240 --> 25:16.210
are little known entrances
to underground passageways

25:16.210 --> 25:19.630
dating back to the Inca.

25:19.630 --> 25:21.710
Many of the openings
have been covered up

25:21.710 --> 25:24.130
and sealed for public safety,

25:24.130 --> 25:27.590
but a few
still remain accessible.

25:27.590 --> 25:30.550
In 2017,

25:30.550 --> 25:32.970
David Childress visited the site

25:32.970 --> 25:35.850
of one of
the remaining open tunnels.

25:38.020 --> 25:39.270
CHILDRESS:
There is a labyrinth

25:39.270 --> 25:41.940
of tunnels beneath Cusco,

25:41.940 --> 25:45.490
and they extend for hundreds
of miles in every direction.

25:45.490 --> 25:48.240
And some of these tunnels
even intersect.

25:48.240 --> 25:52.200
Over the years these tunnels
have been blocked off

25:52.200 --> 25:54.080
and sealed,

25:54.080 --> 25:57.750
but you can still access parts
of this tunnel system,

25:57.750 --> 25:59.880
such as this tunnel here,

25:59.880 --> 26:02.880
cut through solid rock.

26:02.880 --> 26:06.670
Local legend says that
the sun disk was transported

26:06.670 --> 26:10.140
out of the city
through these tunnels.

26:10.140 --> 26:11.970
There has been
a lot of speculation

26:11.970 --> 26:14.140
of where the sun disk was taken.

26:14.140 --> 26:17.640
And treasure hunters have been
searching for this location

26:17.640 --> 26:19.810
for centuries.

26:19.810 --> 26:22.480
COWIE:
Legends recount three myths,

26:22.480 --> 26:25.530
as to how the sacred
golden sun disk left Cusco.

26:25.530 --> 26:29.530
Some legends maintain
that it was taken out

26:29.530 --> 26:32.120
through a tunnel system
to Gran Paititi,

26:32.120 --> 26:34.530
a lost Inca village

26:34.530 --> 26:35.950
at the top of a mountain,

26:35.950 --> 26:38.500
which the Spanish
never, ever found.

26:38.500 --> 26:42.500
Some maintain
it was taken to Saksaywaman.

26:42.500 --> 26:47.590
And some maintain it was
returned to Lake Titicaca

26:47.590 --> 26:49.220
from whence it came.

26:51.680 --> 26:55.720
NARRATOR: Located more than
200 miles southeast of Cusco,

26:55.720 --> 27:00.980
at an elevation of over
12,500 feet above sea level,

27:00.980 --> 27:05.650
Titicaca is the highest
navigable lake in the world

27:05.650 --> 27:10.610
and considered sacred
to the local Andean population.

27:10.610 --> 27:12.490
HENRY:
In the Incan creation myth,

27:12.490 --> 27:15.580
their god Viracocha
emerged from Lake Titicaca.

27:15.580 --> 27:18.250
This goes along
with ancient myths and legends

27:18.250 --> 27:21.330
that tell us that there's
an etheric or ethereal city

27:21.330 --> 27:23.130
that's underneath Lake Titicaca.

27:24.670 --> 27:26.550
In light of this,
it makes sense that

27:26.550 --> 27:31.340
the Incas returned their
prized golden disk to the lake.

27:31.340 --> 27:33.930
COWIE: The temple was said
to be a thing of imagination,

27:33.930 --> 27:35.800
a thing of wonder.

27:35.800 --> 27:37.850
Until the year 2000.

27:37.850 --> 27:41.180
In the year 2000, a team
of Italian divers and scientists

27:41.180 --> 27:44.270
ventured to the base
of Lake Titicaca

27:44.270 --> 27:47.980
after finding
a road of Inca stones.

27:47.980 --> 27:50.780
They followed the road
for just less than half a mile,

27:50.780 --> 27:54.910
into the lake.

27:54.910 --> 28:00.450
And discovered
a 650 by 150‐foot temple...

28:02.410 --> 28:04.750
...underneath the waters
of Lake Titicaca.

28:09.130 --> 28:12.050
NARRATOR: Since the discovery
of the temple in Lake Titicaca,

28:12.050 --> 28:16.800
underwater archaeologists
have unearthed 2,000 artifacts,

28:16.800 --> 28:19.680
including
gold and silver objects,

28:19.680 --> 28:22.730
as well as pottery
dating back to the Inca.

28:22.730 --> 28:25.270
Could they be close to finding

28:25.270 --> 28:27.560
the golden sun disk
of Coricancha?

28:29.980 --> 28:32.610
But why are there so many
stories throughout the world

28:32.610 --> 28:37.240
of disks with incredible powers?

28:37.240 --> 28:40.870
Is it possible that
they are all somehow connected

28:40.870 --> 28:44.370
and serve a hidden purpose
for humanity?

28:44.370 --> 28:48.040
Perhaps further clues
can be found by examining

28:48.040 --> 28:50.300
a more recent story
of the discovery

28:50.300 --> 28:52.380
of a mysterious disk.

28:55.720 --> 28:58.890
Grand Teton National Park,
Wyoming.

28:58.890 --> 29:01.850
This majestic mountain range

29:01.850 --> 29:06.190
rises over 13,000 feet
above sea level,

29:06.190 --> 29:09.310
and is the site of one
of the most remarkable claims

29:09.310 --> 29:12.480
of non‐human interactions
on Earth.

29:12.480 --> 29:16.070
In his book
<i>Original Unveiled Mysteries,</i>

29:16.070 --> 29:18.740
published in 1934,

29:18.740 --> 29:21.410
mining engineer Guy Ballard

29:21.410 --> 29:24.120
claims to have been taken
into a secret entrance

29:24.120 --> 29:25.960
within the mountain.

29:25.960 --> 29:28.830
REDFERN:
Ballard claimed that he met

29:28.830 --> 29:31.460
these higher ascended beings,

29:31.460 --> 29:35.340
what today we would perhaps call
extraterrestrials or aliens.

29:35.340 --> 29:38.430
And one of them showed him,
essentially,

29:38.430 --> 29:41.550
sort of a secret opening
into the mountain.

29:41.550 --> 29:47.020
And he was reportedly
taken down this extensive shaft,

29:47.020 --> 29:51.110
possibly even to a depth
of around 2,000 feet.

29:51.110 --> 29:54.860
As they descended, they reached
this particular room,

29:54.860 --> 29:59.700
which contained this large,
circular, disk‐shaped object.

29:59.700 --> 30:03.620
And, when Ballard asked
questions about what it was,

30:03.620 --> 30:05.950
this higher entity said to him

30:05.950 --> 30:09.870
it was essentially
a guiding device,

30:09.870 --> 30:12.340
which could have an effect
on the human mind.

30:15.130 --> 30:17.050
WILCOCK:
Why would an engineer

30:17.050 --> 30:19.050
want to make up
something like this?

30:19.050 --> 30:21.720
His stories are so
detailed and complex

30:21.720 --> 30:23.680
that there is reason to believe

30:23.680 --> 30:25.640
that Ballard was in contact

30:25.640 --> 30:28.350
with some sort of
human‐looking extraterrestrial

30:28.350 --> 30:31.150
who gave him
an eyewitness viewing

30:31.150 --> 30:34.900
of an extraterrestrial disk
that actually had the ability

30:34.900 --> 30:38.990
to steer and guide the people
on the surface of the Earth.

30:38.990 --> 30:44.160
There may be an ability to take
certain materials, like gold,

30:44.160 --> 30:46.870
and to imbue them with thoughts,

30:46.870 --> 30:49.160
such that perhaps
the high priest or priestess

30:49.160 --> 30:52.750
of that civilization could
actually access the disk,

30:52.750 --> 30:54.960
perhaps with
a telepathic process,

30:54.960 --> 30:58.970
and use that
much like a tuning fork,

30:58.970 --> 31:01.130
or an antennae
that gets them in touch

31:01.130 --> 31:03.930
with some sort of
cosmic intelligence.

31:03.930 --> 31:07.930
Because gold has
very unique properties.

31:07.930 --> 31:11.060
It's highly
electrically conductive

31:11.060 --> 31:14.360
and precious metals,
such as gold,

31:14.360 --> 31:17.780
have a certain chemical
and molecular lattice.

31:17.780 --> 31:20.650
They can cluster together
in geometric ways,

31:20.650 --> 31:24.030
which allows them to act
almost like a tuning fork

31:24.030 --> 31:25.870
for the consciousness field.

31:27.950 --> 31:29.950
HENRY:
Ballard's story affirms the idea

31:29.950 --> 31:31.540
that some of these disks
found around the world

31:31.540 --> 31:34.500
are not objects of art.

31:34.500 --> 31:36.960
These are actually
objects brought here

31:36.960 --> 31:39.050
by extraterrestrials
for the purpose

31:39.050 --> 31:40.880
of influencing human affairs.

31:43.550 --> 31:46.220
REDFERN:
If these disks have the ability

31:46.220 --> 31:50.350
to sort of guide the human mind
down certain pathways,

31:50.350 --> 31:54.770
this offers us a potentially
really intriguing scenario.

31:54.770 --> 31:57.520
Maybe in some respects,

31:57.520 --> 32:00.360
the disks themselves
are extraterrestrial,

32:00.360 --> 32:01.820
or they're imbued
with some sort of

32:01.820 --> 32:04.860
extraterrestrial intelligence,

32:04.860 --> 32:08.330
which can essentially
head outwards,

32:08.330 --> 32:12.370
and be soaked in by us,
unknowingly perhaps.

32:14.620 --> 32:17.210
NARRATOR:
If these objects are imbued

32:17.210 --> 32:18.960
with extraterrestrial
consciousness

32:18.960 --> 32:20.710
as Guy Ballard proposed,

32:20.710 --> 32:24.090
is it possible that many
of the other enigmatic disks

32:24.090 --> 32:29.890
found across the globe
are influencing humans as well?

32:29.890 --> 32:33.310
Perhaps the answer can be found

32:33.310 --> 32:35.480
by further examining
the Dropa stones

32:35.480 --> 32:37.860
that were unearthed in China,

32:37.860 --> 32:41.230
and the strange
electrical frequencies

32:41.230 --> 32:43.240
they were said to emit.

32:50.490 --> 32:55.250
NARRATOR:
Interstellar space, June 2017.

32:55.250 --> 32:59.840
Located nearly 13 billion miles
from Earth,

32:59.840 --> 33:05.720
NASA's <i>Voyager 1</i> probe continues
on its path into the unknown.

33:05.720 --> 33:09.760
Launched on September 5, 1977,

33:09.760 --> 33:12.770
the spacecraft
is the furthest from Earth

33:12.770 --> 33:15.730
that any man‐made object
has ever traveled,

33:15.730 --> 33:19.650
having officially exited
the solar system.

33:19.650 --> 33:23.490
If the object is ever found
by an alien race,

33:23.490 --> 33:27.860
they will discover within it
a phonographic disk.

33:27.860 --> 33:31.280
The purpose of the disk itself

33:31.280 --> 33:35.290
was to introduce us
to an extraterrestrial species.

33:35.290 --> 33:39.210
The disk contains
all kinds of audio recordings

33:39.210 --> 33:41.090
that would give clues
as to who we are,

33:41.090 --> 33:43.210
as to our systems of culture,

33:43.210 --> 33:45.510
our systems of science
and mathematics,

33:45.510 --> 33:47.880
giving them,
whoever would discover it,

33:47.880 --> 33:50.760
a very clear guide stone

33:50.760 --> 33:53.850
to understanding
the creators of that disk.

33:53.850 --> 33:58.900
NARRATOR: That same year, NASA
sent a similar time capsule disk

33:58.900 --> 34:03.270
aboard the <i>Voyager 2</i> launched
at a different trajectory.

34:03.270 --> 34:06.490
In both <i>Voyager</i> missions,

34:06.490 --> 34:09.160
the cases that contained
the golden disks

34:09.160 --> 34:12.200
were etched with symbols
explaining how to play them,

34:12.200 --> 34:15.200
as well as mathematical
and scientific concepts

34:15.200 --> 34:20.670
that might be recognizable to an
advanced extraterrestrial race.

34:20.670 --> 34:24.920
Both disks were mounted
on the exterior of the probes,

34:24.920 --> 34:26.970
and to assure their longevity,

34:26.970 --> 34:29.970
the covers were electroplated
in uranium,

34:29.970 --> 34:36.640
which has a half‐life
of over four billion years.

34:36.640 --> 34:40.310
I find it intriguing
that if we are sending out disks

34:40.310 --> 34:42.060
containing information

34:42.060 --> 34:45.730
about us as a species,
our place in the universe,

34:45.730 --> 34:50.030
then it's entirely possible,
even logical,

34:50.030 --> 34:51.990
that, perhaps,
highly advanced aliens

34:51.990 --> 34:54.200
would be doing exactly the same.

34:54.200 --> 34:57.120
And certainly,
there's evidence of this.

35:03.540 --> 35:08.510
NARRATOR:
Xi'an, China, 1974.

35:08.510 --> 35:11.260
At the Banpo Museum,

35:11.260 --> 35:14.260
Austrian engineer Ernst Wegerer

35:14.260 --> 35:19.640
photographs a display featuring
two strange circular objects.

35:19.640 --> 35:22.900
He is told
that they are Dropa stones,

35:22.900 --> 35:27.690
the mysterious disks
discovered in a cave in 1938,

35:27.690 --> 35:31.070
that the Chinese
quickly dismissed as a hoax.

35:31.070 --> 35:35.200
Mysteriously,
as word of the find spreads,

35:35.200 --> 35:39.410
the disks are removed
from the museum.

35:39.410 --> 35:44.710
In spring 1994, I have been
in this Banpo Museum,

35:44.710 --> 35:48.920
and I spoke to the present
curator of this museum

35:48.920 --> 35:51.510
and he told me
a very bizarre story

35:51.510 --> 35:54.760
of what happened
a few days after the visit

35:54.760 --> 35:58.260
of engineer Wegerer
at this museum.

35:58.260 --> 36:02.810
Some days later, the former
manageress of the museum,

36:02.810 --> 36:06.400
along with two stone disks
that were on display,

36:06.400 --> 36:10.440
they have disappeared
without any trace.

36:14.030 --> 36:15.240
NARRATOR:
While further researching

36:15.240 --> 36:16.950
the story of the Dropa stones

36:16.950 --> 36:19.870
for his book
<i>The Chinese Roswell,</i>

36:19.870 --> 36:22.830
Hartwig Hausdorf
uncovered an article

36:22.830 --> 36:25.120
in the Soviet magazine <i>Spoutnik,</i>

36:25.120 --> 36:28.420
detailing tests
performed on the disks.

36:28.420 --> 36:33.300
After the public release
of the story in 1962,

36:33.300 --> 36:37.260
Russian scientist
Dr. Viatcheslav Saizev

36:37.260 --> 36:40.520
requested permission
to study the disks.

36:40.520 --> 36:42.640
In addition to determining

36:42.640 --> 36:45.900
that they were composed
of cobalt, iron and nickel,

36:45.900 --> 36:51.570
the scientist discovered the
stones were emitting a signal.

36:51.570 --> 36:53.860
Accredited scientists noticed

36:53.860 --> 36:56.530
that there was this weird
electromagnetic current

36:56.530 --> 36:59.240
coming off of the Dropa stones
when they were rotated.

36:59.240 --> 37:02.790
And it was discovered
that if you put these stones

37:02.790 --> 37:06.040
onto a regular
phonograph turntable

37:06.040 --> 37:09.130
and rotate them
with the needle on them,

37:09.130 --> 37:11.750
that they actually create
electrical energy.

37:13.510 --> 37:16.630
NARRATOR: The disks
were allegedly returned

37:16.630 --> 37:18.430
to the Chinese government

37:18.430 --> 37:22.430
before further analysis
of the frequency could be made.

37:22.430 --> 37:25.310
WILCOCK:
Under further examination,

37:25.310 --> 37:29.230
that electrical energy may be
much like a radio frequency

37:29.230 --> 37:33.070
or a signal
that could be deciphered.

37:33.070 --> 37:35.650
And it is curious that we were
doing much the same thing

37:35.650 --> 37:38.950
with the gold disks that we put
on <i>Voyager 1</i> and <i>Voyager 2</i>

37:38.950 --> 37:40.950
from NASA directly.

37:42.410 --> 37:45.200
NARRATOR:
Could the Dropa stones,

37:45.200 --> 37:47.870
and other similarly
mysterious disks

37:47.870 --> 37:50.630
discovered
throughout human history,

37:50.630 --> 37:55.380
serve the same function as the
disks NASA sent out into space?

37:55.380 --> 37:57.720
Are they meant to introduce us

37:57.720 --> 38:02.180
to another intelligent race
that exists beyond Earth?

38:02.180 --> 38:05.270
Or do the stories
of their supernatural powers

38:05.270 --> 38:09.850
reveal a more profound purpose?

38:09.850 --> 38:13.610
Perhaps further clues
can be found

38:13.610 --> 38:17.700
by examining an encoded disk
discovered not in a cave,

38:17.700 --> 38:21.120
but in the crop fields
of England.

38:29.750 --> 38:35.460
NARRATOR: Winchester, England,
August 15, 2002.

38:35.460 --> 38:39.430
An alien figure holding
a disk‐shaped object

38:39.430 --> 38:42.640
mysteriously appears
in a crop formation

38:42.640 --> 38:45.100
in the middle of a wheat field.

38:45.100 --> 38:48.850
The image was found
to contain binary code,

38:48.850 --> 38:51.440
a series of ones and zeros

38:51.440 --> 38:55.230
currently used
to write computer data.

38:55.230 --> 38:58.990
Programmers, recognizing
the digital language,

38:58.990 --> 39:03.280
set out to decipher the message.

39:03.280 --> 39:09.370
When we translated that,
it was basically a warning.

39:09.370 --> 39:12.380
And this is what it said:

39:12.380 --> 39:17.380
"Beware of the bearers of false
gifts and their broken promises.

39:17.380 --> 39:20.260
"Much pain but still time.

39:20.260 --> 39:22.050
"There is good out there.

39:22.050 --> 39:25.300
"We oppose deception.

39:25.300 --> 39:28.140
Conduit closing."

39:28.140 --> 39:30.850
Some people said,
"Well, is this disk

39:30.850 --> 39:36.400
"warning about the Grey
that is holding the disk?

39:36.400 --> 39:42.030
Or is the disk itself
the intelligence warning?"

39:42.030 --> 39:45.030
CHILDRESS:
This crop circle disk,

39:45.030 --> 39:48.080
which appears to be encoded
with information,

39:48.080 --> 39:51.870
in theory, must be some kind
of effort by extraterrestrials

39:51.870 --> 39:54.210
to communicate with us,

39:54.210 --> 39:57.550
and give us information
that they think we need.

39:57.550 --> 40:00.760
And it could be possibly
a warning for us.

40:03.510 --> 40:05.140
NARRATOR:
Do the many mysterious disks

40:05.140 --> 40:08.010
found throughout the world,

40:08.010 --> 40:11.480
much like the disk depicted in
the Winchester crop formation,

40:11.480 --> 40:14.770
contain warnings for mankind?

40:14.770 --> 40:17.060
Could they hold information

40:17.060 --> 40:21.610
essential to humanity's
future survival?

40:21.610 --> 40:24.780
GEORGE NOORY: These disks
that were left behind,

40:24.780 --> 40:28.450
with messages from
extraterrestrial races,

40:28.450 --> 40:30.750
they're trying
to tell us things,

40:30.750 --> 40:34.920
and we are obligated
to find out what they are.

40:34.920 --> 40:37.710
And it's appalling
that in many cases,

40:37.710 --> 40:39.800
governments have
confiscated these materials

40:39.800 --> 40:42.720
and these artifacts,

40:42.720 --> 40:45.300
and they won't let anybody know.

40:45.300 --> 40:48.140
We have to look at these disks

40:48.140 --> 40:50.220
as possibly being left for us

40:50.220 --> 40:54.520
and they're here
to influence us and guide us.

40:54.520 --> 40:56.940
They're some kind
of technology here,

40:56.940 --> 40:59.900
and it's up to us to figure out

40:59.900 --> 41:03.280
why these extraterrestrials
have left these disks here

41:03.280 --> 41:06.910
and what their purpose
ultimately is.

41:06.910 --> 41:10.530
These disks could well be
the centerpiece of our study

41:10.530 --> 41:13.120
of ancient alien artifacts.

41:13.120 --> 41:17.290
In fact, they could well be the
extraterrestrials themselves.

41:17.290 --> 41:19.540
By making that connection,

41:19.540 --> 41:22.340
we deepen our understanding
of who they are,

41:22.340 --> 41:23.800
and what they mean to us.

41:23.800 --> 41:26.880
WILCOCK: There is a very strong
likelihood

41:26.880 --> 41:30.100
that these disks are bringing us
closer together,

41:30.100 --> 41:33.850
and creating a bridge between
our world and the worlds beyond.

41:36.100 --> 41:38.270
NARRATOR:
If the many mysterious disks

41:38.270 --> 41:42.610
found scattered across the globe
are interconnected,

41:42.610 --> 41:45.780
might they really serve
some technological purpose

41:45.780 --> 41:49.660
just beyond our current scope
of understanding?

41:49.660 --> 41:53.450
Perhaps the sooner
we are able to fully comprehend

41:53.450 --> 41:57.120
the message
behind these alien disks,

41:57.120 --> 42:01.750
the sooner mankind
will be able to fully reconnect

42:01.750 --> 42:06.140
with our extraterrestrial
ancestors.
