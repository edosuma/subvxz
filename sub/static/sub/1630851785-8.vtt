WEBVTT

00:02.437 --> 00:03.916
- I'm Amira.
- Thank you.

00:03.960 --> 00:06.006
- I can see why Georgetown
is Amira's first choice.

00:06.049 --> 00:07.311
It's a very strong school.

00:07.355 --> 00:08.617
- Strong.
- Mm-hmm.

00:08.660 --> 00:10.010
This the home of AI.

00:10.053 --> 00:12.273
- Dad, they did not invent
artificial intelligence.

00:12.316 --> 00:14.666
- I'm talking about
Allen Iverson, The Answer.

00:14.710 --> 00:16.103
Well, hello, there.

00:16.146 --> 00:18.061
I'm Lynn Parsons,
the admissions counselor.

00:18.105 --> 00:19.628
Welcome
to Georgetown University...

00:19.671 --> 00:23.023
Unofficially,
but hopefully officially.

00:23.066 --> 00:26.461
- I'm Amira,
and these are my two dads.

00:26.504 --> 00:28.767
- I'm the biological.
- And I'm married to her mother.

00:28.811 --> 00:30.334
Ms. Lynn, dig on this.

00:30.378 --> 00:32.510
My daughter
is cream of the crop, okay?

00:32.554 --> 00:34.599
And if you want her
to pick your school,

00:34.643 --> 00:35.905
you got to come correct.

00:35.948 --> 00:39.169
We want cars,
shoe endorsements, the works.

00:39.213 --> 00:41.084
I'm talking about, like,
Jesus Shuttlesworth

00:41.128 --> 00:42.825
in "He Got Game."

00:42.868 --> 00:46.176
- You do know it's illegal
for colleges to do any of that.

00:46.220 --> 00:48.744
- I know. I was just taking
your temperature.

00:48.787 --> 00:50.702
Oh.

00:50.746 --> 00:52.530
I fucks with you.

00:52.574 --> 00:54.184
Oh, well.

00:54.228 --> 00:56.186
Thank you, I think.

00:56.230 --> 00:59.233
The presentation
will begin shortly.

00:59.276 --> 01:01.452
- I'm gonna go say hello
to my friends.

01:03.411 --> 01:05.717
- I don't think I ever saw
Amira this excited.

01:05.761 --> 01:07.241
- Well, it's
a really good school.

01:07.284 --> 01:08.894
But you know what?

01:08.938 --> 01:11.419
Don't take anybody else's
temperature while we're here.

01:11.462 --> 01:13.377
- Come on, you know I like
to play night nurse.

01:13.421 --> 01:15.118
- Look...
- Hmm.

01:15.162 --> 01:18.121
- Pull that off your face.
- Right in the butt.

01:18.165 --> 01:19.383
- I know where it go--

01:19.427 --> 01:21.646
actually, people
don't do that anymore.

01:25.520 --> 01:28.218
<i>- Okay, I want to cancel </i>
this storage locker.

01:28.262 --> 01:30.002
So everything has to go.

01:30.046 --> 01:31.613
You either take it to the trash

01:31.656 --> 01:33.963
or to that donation center
a few blocks away from here.

01:34.006 --> 01:35.573
Can't I just set it on fire?

01:35.617 --> 01:38.533
- You want to be Casanova
and an arsonist?

01:38.576 --> 01:40.491
Don't test me today, boy,
please.

01:40.535 --> 01:43.233
Get your little ass in there
and do some work.

01:49.805 --> 01:52.590
Hello, future Hoyas!

01:52.634 --> 01:54.114
AI!

01:54.157 --> 01:56.855
Patrick Ewing!

01:56.899 --> 01:58.292
Dad, shh!

01:58.335 --> 02:00.250
- Georgetown admits
a record number

02:00.294 --> 02:02.383
of National Honor Society
scholars,

02:02.426 --> 02:04.472
many of whom are with us today.

02:04.515 --> 02:06.778
Please stand
when your name is called.

02:06.822 --> 02:11.914
Melissa Anderson, Chloe Barnes,
Madison Brey,

02:11.957 --> 02:14.612
Hannah Fulson, Josh Nolan,

02:14.656 --> 02:17.746
Noah Turner, Elizabeth Ward.

02:17.789 --> 02:22.751
Let's congratulate
all our NHS attendees.

02:22.794 --> 02:24.274
They skipped Birkeland.

02:24.318 --> 02:25.884
Stand up anyway.

02:25.928 --> 02:27.625
No, no, it's okay.

02:27.669 --> 02:29.627
- No, you earned this.
Stand up.

02:34.806 --> 02:36.460
Um, excuse me.

02:36.504 --> 02:39.942
Excuse me, you forgot to
call my name--Amira Birkeland.

02:39.985 --> 02:42.466
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:42.510 --> 02:45.382
Your name wasn't on my list,

02:45.426 --> 02:47.645
but congratulations.

02:47.689 --> 02:50.779
And now, for the student-led
portion of our program,

02:50.822 --> 02:52.694
please welcome
Georgetown seniors

02:52.737 --> 02:57.089
Zachary Feldlin
and Andrea Gruber.

02:57.133 --> 02:59.483
They'll answer your questions.

02:59.527 --> 03:01.181
You right here in the front.

03:01.224 --> 03:03.357
- Is it mandatory to live
in the dorms?

03:03.400 --> 03:05.794
- It's not mandatory, but it's
recommended for freshmen

03:05.837 --> 03:08.013
just to help make you familiar
with the campus,

03:08.057 --> 03:09.406
meet new people.

03:09.450 --> 03:11.539
- Saw some other hands.
- You.

03:11.582 --> 03:13.584
- Oh, um, I was just wond--

03:13.628 --> 03:15.282
Oh, no, sorry, behind you.

03:15.325 --> 03:16.631
- Me?
- Yes.

03:16.674 --> 03:18.328
- Is the food in the cafeteria
any good?

03:18.372 --> 03:19.764
You see this shit?

03:19.808 --> 03:22.027
Amira had her hand up
way before this one did.

03:22.071 --> 03:24.813
And they can't be disrespecting
my baby girl like this.

03:24.856 --> 03:26.684
She ain't got to go
to Georgetown.

03:26.728 --> 03:28.512
She could go
to Bronx Community College,

03:28.556 --> 03:29.992
- right uptown.
- Tray.

03:30.035 --> 03:31.646
- You have to calm down.
- I know people there.

03:31.689 --> 03:33.691
- Calm down, okay?
It's a little bit odd.

03:33.735 --> 03:36.999
You're right,
but let's not make assumptions.

03:57.367 --> 04:00.240
Oh, Grandma and Grandpa,
no way.

04:04.113 --> 04:05.506
- Oh, sh--

04:07.334 --> 04:09.249
Thank you all for coming.

04:09.292 --> 04:12.077
Hopefully we'll see you
in the fall.

04:15.385 --> 04:18.780
- Um, I'm gonna go say bye
to my friends.

04:20.434 --> 04:21.739
- Think Amira is having
second thoughts

04:21.783 --> 04:23.088
about going to this school.

04:23.132 --> 04:24.742
Yeah, I wouldn't blame her.

04:24.786 --> 04:27.267
- You know, she ain't ask
one question out of her book.

04:27.310 --> 04:28.790
And she worked so hard on it.

04:28.833 --> 04:30.705
I never went to college,
but I do know

04:30.748 --> 04:33.490
you supposed to be way
more excited than that today.

04:33.534 --> 04:35.405
both: We're all going
to Georgetown!

04:38.713 --> 04:40.323
- She looks
pretty excited now.

04:49.289 --> 04:52.379
- Amira liked the presentation,
but I didn't, man.

04:52.422 --> 04:53.945
They ain't call on her once,

04:53.989 --> 04:56.774
and she had her hand raised
the whole entire time.

04:56.818 --> 04:59.473
- You know what that is?
Them goddamn microaggressions.

04:59.516 --> 05:01.431
That's exactly why
I dropped out of ITT Tech.

05:01.475 --> 05:02.998
- That's online, right?
- Yep.

05:03.041 --> 05:06.001
Cyber racism--
it's the worst kind, my nigga.

05:07.742 --> 05:09.961
- What up, young bull?
- What up, Jay?

05:10.005 --> 05:12.312
Yo, Dad, check out what I found
in Grandma's storage.

05:12.355 --> 05:14.749
- I hope it ain't them little
black dolls she used to keep.

05:14.792 --> 05:16.316
No, those are still there.

05:16.359 --> 05:17.665
- I remember
when I was little, man,

05:17.708 --> 05:19.014
I felt like they was
following me around

05:19.057 --> 05:20.407
like a couple
of little Black Chuckies.

05:20.450 --> 05:22.800
I know what you mean.

05:22.844 --> 05:25.281
Look at this.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.804
- Look at that.

05:26.848 --> 05:28.632
That's your grandmother,
and that's your grandfather.

05:28.676 --> 05:30.025
- I know.
- That's my man.

05:30.068 --> 05:31.809
- I know.
Did you, uh--

05:31.853 --> 05:34.377
did you know Grandma and
Grandpa were in a band?

05:34.421 --> 05:37.075
- A band?
- Uh, yeah, they made a record.

05:37.119 --> 05:40.992
- Wow! This looks legit,
like the co-ed O'Jays.

05:41.036 --> 05:44.561
- That football murderer guy?
- No, the R&B group.

05:44.605 --> 05:46.302
And, plus, OJ didn't do it.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.130
If he did, they wouldn't have
gave him a Twitter account.

05:48.173 --> 05:49.392
Yo, Jaybird, come here.

05:49.436 --> 05:50.828
Check out these pictures
of my parents

05:50.872 --> 05:52.656
- that Shahzad found, man.
- Oh, word?

05:52.700 --> 05:55.050
- They look so young
and vibrant, full of life.

05:55.093 --> 05:57.879
- Yeah, this had to be
before you was born,

05:57.922 --> 05:59.968
'cause look at your mama
with these pre-Tray titties.

06:00.011 --> 06:01.839
- I like that.
- Give me my mom's pictures.

06:01.883 --> 06:03.667
Don't be looking
at my mom's titties, man.

06:03.711 --> 06:05.147
Focus on her big,
beautiful smile.

06:05.190 --> 06:07.410
- I'm focused.
- Let's listen to the album.

06:07.454 --> 06:08.846
- Well, we did have
a record player,

06:08.890 --> 06:10.500
but one of the kids
out of the art class

06:10.544 --> 06:12.284
made it into a pottery wheel,
so that's out.

06:12.328 --> 06:14.896
- I can't believe that my mom
didn't tell me about this, kid.

06:14.939 --> 06:18.508
I knew my pops had dabbled
in music 'cause he had a voice,

06:18.552 --> 06:21.859
but I ain't know
he took it this far.

06:24.340 --> 06:27.038
- I know they didn't feed you
at that little seminar.

06:28.649 --> 06:30.390
So how did it go?

06:30.433 --> 06:32.696
Grandma, it was amazing.

06:32.740 --> 06:34.394
- And...
- Uh-huh.

06:34.437 --> 06:36.396
- I've decided
I'm going to Georgetown.

06:36.439 --> 06:37.832
Mm.

06:37.875 --> 06:40.661
But you didn't do
the Hampton presentation yet.

06:40.704 --> 06:43.141
- Yeah, but I don't even feel
like it's worth going to.

06:43.185 --> 06:45.666
I just--I know that Georgetown
will be a better fit for me,

06:45.709 --> 06:47.494
and I will know people.

06:47.537 --> 06:49.234
I just feel like
I can be myself there.

06:49.278 --> 06:51.236
- Just because something is
familiar don't mean it's right.

06:51.280 --> 06:55.240
I'm just saying, I think you
should give Hampton a chance.

06:55.284 --> 06:56.503
That's all. That's all.

06:56.546 --> 06:57.895
- Ma?
- What?

06:57.939 --> 06:59.462
- Look what Shahzad found
in the storage.

06:59.506 --> 07:01.072
Yeah, this is so cool.

07:01.116 --> 07:03.118
- I did not know you
and my pops was in a group.

07:03.161 --> 07:05.381
Grandma, you look so good.

07:05.425 --> 07:06.904
- I don't want to talk
about it.

07:06.948 --> 07:08.036
What? Why?

07:08.079 --> 07:10.430
Ma, you look so happy
in this photo.

07:10.473 --> 07:12.519
At least tell me
who the third dude is.

07:12.562 --> 07:16.479
- I said, "I don't wanna
talk about it."

07:16.523 --> 07:18.176
You know what?

07:18.220 --> 07:20.048
You act like this every time
I wanna talk about my pops.

07:20.091 --> 07:22.616
Now, I got a right to know
who he is and what he's about.

07:22.659 --> 07:25.183
- You're right, baby.
Let me see the picture.

07:37.021 --> 07:39.763
I said I didn't want to talk
about it.

07:39.807 --> 07:41.896
I asked you to do one thing--

07:41.939 --> 07:43.898
that was clean out
my storage unit.

07:43.941 --> 07:47.118
I didn't ask you
to rifle through my life.

07:56.563 --> 07:58.086
- Hey, Miss Miller.
- Hey.

07:58.129 --> 08:00.523
- How was class today?
- It was good except for--

08:00.567 --> 08:02.090
somebody got to talk
to Mr. Drayton

08:02.133 --> 08:04.614
and tell that man to put on
some damn undergarments.

08:04.658 --> 08:06.311
- What, his hernia balls
dripped out again?

08:06.355 --> 08:08.488
I'll give him a talk.
I bought this for you.

08:08.531 --> 08:10.098
Thank you.

08:10.141 --> 08:11.795
So sweet.

08:11.839 --> 08:13.797
- Miss Miller,
can I talk to you for a minute?

08:13.841 --> 08:16.800
- Sure!
Mm-hmm.

08:16.844 --> 08:18.498
- You my mom's
best friend, right?

08:18.541 --> 08:21.326
- Since seventh grade.
- Wow, long time.

08:21.370 --> 08:24.068
So why won't she tell me
anything about my father

08:24.112 --> 08:26.854
and this band
that they had--100% Pure?

08:26.897 --> 08:28.508
I tried to ask about it,
and she shut me down.

08:28.551 --> 08:30.771
- She won't tell me nothing.
- Yeah.

08:32.207 --> 08:33.513
This album.

08:33.556 --> 08:35.297
- What?
You knew about it?

08:35.340 --> 08:38.648
- You know, I bet your kids had
a bunch of hard-ass questions

08:38.692 --> 08:40.084
for you when you got
out of prison.

08:40.128 --> 08:41.999
- Yeah, but I told 'em
everything.

08:42.043 --> 08:43.784
I even took them
to the graveyard

08:43.827 --> 08:45.525
and showed them
where they were conceived at.

08:45.568 --> 08:47.831
- But you're a very different
breed, Tray Barker.

08:47.875 --> 08:50.312
You get that from your daddy.
But my point is,

08:50.355 --> 08:54.142
is that this
is a part of your mother's past

08:54.185 --> 08:56.361
that she obviously
doesn't wanna share.

08:56.405 --> 08:59.016
- Yeah, but I deserve to know
anything about my father.

08:59.060 --> 09:01.932
- Sure you do, but that part
of her life was traumatic.

09:01.976 --> 09:04.935
And you owe her
the grace and space

09:04.979 --> 09:07.155
to let her feel about it
the way she gonna feel about it.

09:07.198 --> 09:10.114
And when she ready to share,
she'll tell you.

09:11.855 --> 09:14.031
Thank you, Miss Miller.

09:14.075 --> 09:15.206
I get it.

09:15.250 --> 09:16.338
Mm, mm.

09:16.381 --> 09:17.948
Sorry.

09:20.168 --> 09:21.386
I forgot my water.

09:38.229 --> 09:39.535
Can I help you?

09:39.579 --> 09:41.537
- I just wanna say, Ma,
I'm giving you the grace

09:41.581 --> 09:43.278
for all the trauma you've been
through in your life.

09:43.321 --> 09:46.586
You could tell me whatever
you want when you ready.

09:46.629 --> 09:48.631
- Well, I would like
to say something.

09:48.675 --> 09:50.067
Anything, Ma.

09:50.111 --> 09:53.027
- Get the hell out of my face!
- That's good.

09:53.070 --> 09:55.072
Let it out.
Let it all out.

09:55.116 --> 09:56.291
I'm here for you.

09:56.334 --> 09:58.206
- Could you be here for me
in another room?

09:58.249 --> 10:00.991
'Cause I am trying
to watch my show.

10:14.048 --> 10:15.919
- Hello?
- I'm here for you, Mommy.

10:15.963 --> 10:17.791
<i>Love from the other room.</i>

10:29.803 --> 10:31.979
- Man, it smell like sex
between Erykah Badu

10:32.022 --> 10:36.070
and André 3000 in here--
magical, unicorn!

10:36.113 --> 10:38.420
- Hey, I know
it's not Georgetown,

10:38.463 --> 10:40.117
but give it a chance, okay?

10:40.161 --> 10:41.118
Smile.

10:41.162 --> 10:43.468
Hey, I'm Malia!

10:43.512 --> 10:44.600
- Oh.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.863
Amira, and my two dads.

10:46.907 --> 10:49.126
- He's the biological.
- She got papers on him.

10:49.170 --> 10:52.086
- Welcome.
She has your eyes.

10:52.129 --> 10:54.262
- Are you guys having
peach cobbler

10:54.305 --> 10:56.003
or something cinnamon-y
for lunch?

10:56.046 --> 10:57.134
It smells really good.

10:57.178 --> 10:59.093
Oh, no, girl, that's just me.

10:59.136 --> 11:00.311
Well, us.

11:00.355 --> 11:02.966
This is basically
a shea butter convention,

11:03.010 --> 11:04.794
but I heard that lunch
is shrimp and grits.

11:04.838 --> 11:06.709
Mmm. Sounds delicious.

11:06.753 --> 11:08.232
These bags are the shit!

11:08.276 --> 11:10.365
Y'all got everything in here
a Black person needs

11:10.408 --> 11:11.714
except for a VHS tape

11:11.758 --> 11:13.890
of "Three the Hard Way"
and some Funyuns.

11:13.934 --> 11:16.850
- You know that welcome bag
is hers.

11:16.893 --> 11:19.809
But I can grab some extra
for y'all from the back.

11:19.853 --> 11:22.507
Just take a seat.
We're about to get started.

11:22.551 --> 11:24.814
- It's like academic Wakanda
in here, man.

11:24.858 --> 11:26.555
I ain't seen
this many smart niggas

11:26.598 --> 11:28.818
since Diddy did
fucking Broadway.

11:28.862 --> 11:30.515
- All right, everyone,
let's take a seat.

11:30.559 --> 11:32.692
Let's take a seat.

11:32.735 --> 11:34.171
Good morning, everyone,

11:34.215 --> 11:37.827
and welcome future Pirates
of Hampton University!

11:37.871 --> 11:40.308
Home by the sea!

11:40.351 --> 11:43.311
- all: Home by the sea!
- All right, all right.

11:43.354 --> 11:45.487
As I look at all you
prospective students,

11:45.530 --> 11:47.881
I think about how I was
sitting here just like you.

11:47.924 --> 11:50.666
I went to a prestigious
private high school,

11:50.710 --> 11:55.497
extremely competitive,
and, frankly, not very diverse.

11:55.540 --> 11:57.673
At times, I felt invisible.

11:57.717 --> 12:01.721
But at Hampton,
I feel seen, heard, challenged.

12:01.764 --> 12:03.461
At HU,
we learn from new voices,

12:03.505 --> 12:06.377
not white guy
after white guy after--

12:07.727 --> 12:08.858
My bad.

12:08.902 --> 12:10.555
No offense.

12:10.599 --> 12:12.035
I'm sure you're a nice dude.

12:12.079 --> 12:14.211
But keeping it 100,
it just feels good

12:14.255 --> 12:16.039
to be around folks
who look like us!

12:16.083 --> 12:17.737
- Yes.
- Am I right?

12:27.703 --> 12:29.096
Hey, excuse me, do you know

12:29.139 --> 12:30.837
if the Goodfill donation center
is this way?

12:30.880 --> 12:32.752
- Yeah, it's about two blocks
up on the right.

12:32.795 --> 12:34.057
- Can't miss it.
- Thank you.

12:34.101 --> 12:36.799
- Oh, wow.
Is this a fondue set?

12:36.843 --> 12:39.933
Very nice, so retro.

12:39.976 --> 12:41.891
Got yourself a rare beaut here.

12:41.935 --> 12:44.807
- I don't know what fondue is,
but you like it?

12:44.851 --> 12:46.113
- I could take it
off your hands.

12:46.156 --> 12:47.592
I've got a nice herbed Brie

12:47.636 --> 12:50.247
I'd love to get this thing
wrapped around.

12:50.291 --> 12:53.381
- Um, no,
I'm actually selling it.

12:53.424 --> 12:55.252
- I thought
you were donating it.

12:55.296 --> 12:57.385
Nah.

12:57.428 --> 12:59.082
Ooh!

12:59.126 --> 13:01.824
Can I get a package deal
on these historical figurines?

13:01.868 --> 13:04.435
- No, no--
you like these way too much.

13:04.479 --> 13:07.874
But, uh, let's talk numbers
on that fondue set.

13:09.832 --> 13:11.616
all:
HU!

13:11.660 --> 13:13.444
We are Hampton U!

13:20.538 --> 13:22.453
HU!

13:22.497 --> 13:24.629
HU!

13:24.673 --> 13:26.196
U!

13:31.898 --> 13:33.725
The home by the sea!

13:37.512 --> 13:39.122
HU.

13:40.907 --> 13:43.518
- What do fraternities do
at white colleges?

13:43.561 --> 13:47.130
- They drink, party,
and they drink again.

13:50.351 --> 13:54.834
all:

13:58.489 --> 14:00.927
- Let's march on.

14:00.970 --> 14:03.581
all:

14:07.411 --> 14:11.328
- Thank you all for coming,
and see you all next year.

14:16.943 --> 14:18.814
How did you know the song?

14:18.858 --> 14:20.294
Beyoncé, Coachella.

14:20.337 --> 14:22.470
It's pretty emotional,
isn't it?

14:22.513 --> 14:25.125
- Did you know there was
a Black national anthem?

14:25.168 --> 14:27.997
- Yeah, but I thought it was
"Fuck Tha Police."

14:29.956 --> 14:32.523
What's up with those
extra gift bags?

14:32.567 --> 14:33.873
Hold on, excuse me.

14:33.916 --> 14:35.352
Uh, 'Mira. Amira.

14:35.396 --> 14:37.137
Ha ha,
that was dope, right?

14:37.180 --> 14:38.921
I'm getting really good vibes
from Hampton.

14:38.965 --> 14:41.358
I think it's a good school, and
I think it'd be great for you.

14:41.402 --> 14:44.492
- Well, I'm glad you liked it.
It was definitely something.

14:44.535 --> 14:46.407
But I think I'd rather go
to Georgetown.

14:46.450 --> 14:47.843
Wait a minute.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.714
Was we at two different
presentations right there?

14:49.758 --> 14:52.195
'Cause what I saw on that stage
is more than just something.

14:52.239 --> 14:53.675
And you still choose
Georgetown?

14:53.718 --> 14:56.591
- Yeah, I just--I think
I'd do better there.

14:56.634 --> 14:58.723
Amira, come here.

14:58.767 --> 15:00.247
You're like a kid genius.

15:00.290 --> 15:02.205
I'm still in awe
that you come from me.

15:02.249 --> 15:04.904
Now, Shahzad, I know he mines.

15:04.947 --> 15:08.037
But you gonna shine
wherever you go.

15:08.081 --> 15:11.475
So, baby girl,
what's the real problem?

15:11.519 --> 15:12.955
- I just--

15:12.999 --> 15:15.958
I feel like I'm not gonna
fit in at Hampton.

15:16.002 --> 15:17.525
What if I'm not Black enough?

15:17.568 --> 15:20.528
- You Black enough to fill
any space you choose,

15:20.571 --> 15:22.399
so don't you ever
question yourself.

15:22.443 --> 15:25.228
- I'm sorry, Dad, but my
decision is not gonna change.

15:25.272 --> 15:26.447
I just--I want to go
to Georgetown

15:26.490 --> 15:27.970
where I'll feel
more comfortable.

15:28.014 --> 15:29.580
- Was you comfortable
being ignored

15:29.624 --> 15:31.843
at that Georgetown
presentation?

15:31.887 --> 15:34.063
- No.
No, of course, not.

15:34.107 --> 15:35.586
So you'll be more comfortable

15:35.630 --> 15:37.327
being uncomfortable
around white people

15:37.371 --> 15:41.375
than you would be
around Black people?

15:41.418 --> 15:42.550
Yes.

15:54.910 --> 15:57.260
- What's going on?
- It's Amira.

15:57.304 --> 15:59.262
She don't think she
Black enough to go to Hampton,

15:59.306 --> 16:01.438
so she's choosing Georgetown.

16:01.482 --> 16:02.657
What? Wait.

16:02.700 --> 16:04.441
Amira, why are you calling
your Blackness

16:04.485 --> 16:05.921
into question all of a sudden?

16:05.965 --> 16:07.967
Can you not be a white dad

16:08.010 --> 16:11.100
in an HBCU hat
asking me that right now?

16:11.144 --> 16:13.102
Touché, right?

16:13.146 --> 16:15.626
As promised...

16:16.932 --> 16:18.455
Can I borrow her for a second?

16:18.499 --> 16:19.979
Sure.

16:21.197 --> 16:22.938
I saw you back there.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.679
It's a little
overwhelming, huh?

16:24.722 --> 16:25.985
You could tell?

16:26.028 --> 16:27.595
- Girl, I didn't even know
there was

16:27.638 --> 16:30.467
a Black national anthem
until my orientation day.

16:30.511 --> 16:32.904
- Okay, thank you
for saying that.

16:32.948 --> 16:34.167
Look, I know it's a lot,

16:34.210 --> 16:36.169
but it's not meant
to isolate you.

16:36.212 --> 16:38.127
It's meant to reassure you.

16:38.171 --> 16:40.303
- I was totally having
an identity crisis.

16:40.347 --> 16:43.219
- I get it, but sometimes
what feels like a crisis

16:43.263 --> 16:44.960
is actually the beginning
of an awakening.

16:45.004 --> 16:48.833
And I promise I'm not trying
to get all T.D. Jakes on you.

16:48.877 --> 16:51.575
I'm just saying it because
I've been in your shoes.

16:51.619 --> 16:52.881
It took me a while,

16:52.924 --> 16:54.970
but the thing I learned
the most at Hampton,

16:55.014 --> 16:57.625
is that Blackness
is so many things.

16:57.668 --> 16:59.496
There isn't one way
to be Black,

16:59.540 --> 17:02.064
and you decide
what that means for you.

17:02.108 --> 17:04.806
Well, you and Black Twitter.

17:04.849 --> 17:07.330
- Thanks for talking to me.
- Of course.

17:07.374 --> 17:10.333
Look, college is hard.
It pushes you.

17:10.377 --> 17:13.162
It's uncomfortable no matter
where you choose to go.

17:13.206 --> 17:14.903
But I know at Hampton,

17:14.946 --> 17:17.601
you wouldn't be alone because
I would be your big sister.

17:17.645 --> 17:20.343
- Wait, for real?
You would do that for me?

17:20.387 --> 17:22.041
- Why?

17:22.084 --> 17:26.045
- Because that's what we do.
We look out for each other.

17:35.576 --> 17:37.752
- I wonder what she said
to Amira that I didn't.

17:37.795 --> 17:41.060
- Well, sometimes
it's not what you say.

17:41.103 --> 17:42.931
It's how you say it.

17:52.506 --> 17:54.595
- Tray, come in here
for a minute?

17:54.638 --> 17:57.076
I want to talk about
what happened the other day.

18:06.433 --> 18:07.651
I, uh...

18:07.695 --> 18:09.392
Ma...

18:09.436 --> 18:11.742
I'm sorry for the way
I came at you the other day.

18:11.786 --> 18:14.397
I promise to do a better job
of listening

18:14.441 --> 18:16.921
and respecting your boundaries
moving forward.

18:16.965 --> 18:18.227
That's all I want to say.

18:18.271 --> 18:21.230
- Well, I appreciate
you saying this.

18:21.274 --> 18:24.712
Sometimes
it's just hard to get--

18:24.755 --> 18:27.323
- And I've got
something else for you.

18:27.367 --> 18:31.501
Your granddaughter
listened to your advice...

18:31.545 --> 18:33.068
and she's going to Hampton.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.940
- What?
Really?

18:35.984 --> 18:37.377
Wow!

18:37.420 --> 18:39.118
Well, that's wonderful news!

18:39.161 --> 18:43.774
You know, I used to fantasize
about you going to an HBCU.

18:43.818 --> 18:46.342
- I would've went to Hampton
and got everybody pregnant.

18:46.386 --> 18:48.736
You know I got to spread
this Black excellence, Ma.

18:48.779 --> 18:51.782
- If you don't stop--
you are delusional.

18:53.219 --> 18:54.437
Well...

18:54.481 --> 18:58.137
I just want to say, um...

18:58.180 --> 19:00.617
I apologize for my reaction.

19:00.661 --> 19:02.619
When your father got back
from Vietnam,

19:02.663 --> 19:06.319
he was dead set
on pursuing this music career.

19:06.362 --> 19:09.626
He wanted to be
the next Berry Gordy,

19:09.670 --> 19:12.803
and then had the nerve
to talk me into it.

19:14.849 --> 19:18.157
So I took all our savings

19:18.200 --> 19:19.810
and put it in this record,

19:19.854 --> 19:22.204
and we had
a good time doing it.

19:22.248 --> 19:23.727
- Wow.

19:23.771 --> 19:25.468
- I can tell by looking
at these pictures.

19:25.512 --> 19:26.904
And you look good, Mommy.

19:26.948 --> 19:28.167
Thank you.

19:28.210 --> 19:29.646
And Jimmy was sexy.

19:29.690 --> 19:32.301
I mean, I'd never seen a man
turn so many heads

19:32.345 --> 19:34.912
with a powder-blue tuxedo
and a ruffled shirt.

19:34.956 --> 19:37.437
- And that big-ass bow tie.
- That's true.

19:40.222 --> 19:41.397
Oh, gosh.

19:41.441 --> 19:45.314
Well, the record bombed...

19:45.358 --> 19:48.839
and, uh, we lost all our money.

19:48.883 --> 19:50.841
We had to go on welfare
for a little while,

19:50.885 --> 19:54.932
which is no shame,
but it broke him.

19:54.976 --> 19:58.501
He could not accept the fact
that he couldn't provide,

19:58.545 --> 20:00.677
and that broke my heart.

20:00.721 --> 20:02.505
- I just want to say
to you, Mommy,

20:02.549 --> 20:04.507
me and your grandkids

20:04.551 --> 20:07.380
thank you for everything
you did for us.

20:08.555 --> 20:10.513
- Ma, can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

20:10.557 --> 20:12.211
Who is this third dude?

20:12.254 --> 20:14.909
Oh, let sleeping dogs lie.
