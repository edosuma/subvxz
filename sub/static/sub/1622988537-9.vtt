WEBVTT

00:05.047 --> 00:07.049
State your names for the record, please.

00:08.007 --> 00:09.426
Hank Gillis, test pilot.

00:10.260 --> 00:12.513
Arthur Conway. Air traffic control tower.

00:13.347 --> 00:16.558
And it's your belief
that the sealant we used here

00:16.642 --> 00:19.186
is causing adverse health effects.

00:19.269 --> 00:21.230
Yes. That's why we're here.

00:26.068 --> 00:27.694
They were whistleblowers.

00:27.778 --> 00:30.781
They wanted to warn people
about what Strata was doing.

00:30.864 --> 00:33.116
You mean like us?

00:33.909 --> 00:36.662
And I think that's why
Strata went after them.

00:36.745 --> 00:38.997
I think that's why
someone damaged Hank's plane.

00:39.081 --> 00:41.834
Wait,
do you guys think they killed Sam's dad?

00:44.169 --> 00:47.756
It's getting hot in here. I'm sweaty.
Are you guys sweaty?

00:48.340 --> 00:49.758
We can't prove that though.

00:49.842 --> 00:52.094
Yeah, because it's all circumstantial.

00:52.177 --> 00:55.013
Great word. Are you guys seeing stars?
'Cause I'm seeing stars.

00:56.223 --> 00:59.142
But we can prove
that Strata knew about the cadmium.

01:00.978 --> 01:04.355
So they knew it was dangerous,
and then they just decided to cover it up.

01:04.438 --> 01:07.776
And now their workers,
people like my Pop-Pop,

01:07.860 --> 01:09.945
are sick and suffering because of them.

01:11.196 --> 01:12.406
That's our story.

01:13.198 --> 01:16.368
You're right.
We're gonna blow this thing wide open.

01:16.451 --> 01:18.370
They have no idea
what's about to hit them.

01:58.035 --> 02:00.662
-Hey. Thanks for coming.
-Hey.

02:00.746 --> 02:02.497
Girl, I know you got that e-mail too.

02:02.581 --> 02:04.833
I did. That video is pretty damning.

02:04.917 --> 02:06.960
Yeah.
Let's hope it damns them straight to--

02:07.044 --> 02:08.836
-Daddy.
-All right.

02:09.670 --> 02:12.007
-Now, will it hold up in court?
-Have a seat.

02:12.090 --> 02:14.760
Do you think we could use it
to build a case against them?

02:14.843 --> 02:16.094
Yeah, that's what we're hoping.

02:16.178 --> 02:18.972
I mean, the guys Syl used to fish with,
they're all…

02:19.056 --> 02:20.224
Dead.

02:20.307 --> 02:22.351
-Dead men can't tell tales.
-Yeah.

02:22.434 --> 02:25.896
Matt's been trying to hunt down anyone
who used to work with Syl at the factory.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.314
If enough people come forward,

02:27.397 --> 02:29.608
then maybe we can file a class action
against Strata.

02:29.691 --> 02:33.320
It's one thing for them to, you know,
come after our family or yours, but--

02:33.403 --> 02:35.447
But if the whole community
stands up to them--

02:35.531 --> 02:37.074
They'd crumble.

02:37.157 --> 02:40.077
Yeah, Terry Weaver moved out of state
a few years ago.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.912
I can get his new address for you.

02:44.081 --> 02:46.542
Strata made a powerful enemy
when they went after you,

02:46.625 --> 02:47.626
didn't they, Daddy?

02:48.168 --> 02:51.213
Well, our family's been here
just as long as theirs has.

02:51.296 --> 02:52.297
Yep.

02:52.881 --> 02:56.051
Look, Frank and I are working
on this, too, down at the station.

02:56.134 --> 02:59.596
-If we find anything, I will let you know.
-Thank you, Sheriff.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.681
I got us, girl.

03:02.432 --> 03:05.435
I'm gonna take this. I'll be right out.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.043
Hey, Pop?

03:31.461 --> 03:34.548
I got a little surprise for you.

03:36.133 --> 03:39.428
Yeah. It's kinda stupid,
but I think you're gonna love it.

03:44.850 --> 03:45.851
Hey, Pop?

04:15.172 --> 04:16.380
Yeah.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.261
Yeah. Yeah.

04:27.309 --> 04:31.522
Yeah, it's okay.
It's okay. I'm right here.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.734
I'm right here.

04:53.418 --> 04:54.419
Dad.

04:55.170 --> 04:57.589
Hey, Hilde. Come here.
Come here. Look at me.

04:58.757 --> 05:00.300
All right, look at me.

05:00.384 --> 05:01.677
-All right, Pop-Pop--
-Yeah.

05:02.261 --> 05:03.971
All right, he's passed away.

05:04.054 --> 05:06.890
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah. He's passed away.
-No, no, no, no.

05:06.974 --> 05:09.893
-No, no, no, no, no!
-Okay? Hilde.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.395
Look at me. You know what?

05:11.478 --> 05:16.066
He fell asleep,
and he went peacefully, okay?

05:17.651 --> 05:20.487
Yeah, he's gone. He's gone.

05:20.571 --> 05:24.533
It's okay. It's okay.
I know, I know. It's okay.

05:28.537 --> 05:30.330
It's okay. It's okay.

05:31.081 --> 05:32.291
It's okay.

05:35.544 --> 05:37.713
I know. I know, I know, I know.

05:57.733 --> 05:58.734
Hi.

06:00.444 --> 06:01.778
That's it?

06:02.779 --> 06:06.325
He's just… gone?

06:08.243 --> 06:09.369
Come on, let's go.

06:13.999 --> 06:16.376
Hey. Come here.

06:20.130 --> 06:23.258
Okay. He…

06:24.801 --> 06:26.970
He was happy, you know.

06:27.554 --> 06:28.555
And…

06:31.975 --> 06:32.976
I'm sorry.

06:33.602 --> 06:35.812
He loved you. He loved you both.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.148
He loved you kids so much.

06:39.399 --> 06:40.400
You know.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.737
He got a chance to love you.

06:45.822 --> 06:49.952
And he wasn't in any more pain, you know.
It's the best we could've asked for.

06:52.663 --> 06:55.457
But I didn't even get a chance
to say goodbye.

06:56.041 --> 06:57.709
I know. I know, sweetie.

06:58.877 --> 07:02.631
It's okay. He's not alone.
He's in heaven with Walter.

07:02.714 --> 07:04.633
Remember, Hilde?

07:07.511 --> 07:08.512
Yeah.

07:09.721 --> 07:11.139
Yeah.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.108
Sorry, Pop-Pop.

08:46.360 --> 08:47.361
It's too late.

08:52.783 --> 08:53.784
All right, I got it.

08:56.954 --> 08:58.163
-Hey.
-I take it you are

08:58.247 --> 09:00.207
Matthew Lisko and Bridget Jensen?

09:00.290 --> 09:02.751
-Hi.
-I'm looking for Hilde Lisko.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.254
Can we ask why?

09:05.337 --> 09:07.923
-She's being served.
-Oh, my gosh.

09:08.006 --> 09:12.010
She's been served?
You've gotta be kidding me. She's a child.

09:12.719 --> 09:13.887
Here, let me see that.

09:14.763 --> 09:18.559
"Strata Tech Industries
is seeking an emergency injunction

09:18.642 --> 09:23.730
to halt the publication and dissemination
of Miss Hilde Lisko's article." What the--

09:23.814 --> 09:25.148
What's going on?

09:27.317 --> 09:31.905
I'm sorry, honey, but the court is
stopping you from publishing.

09:32.489 --> 09:34.491
-What?
-Yeah, it's a gag order.

09:35.075 --> 09:38.537
It means that Strata doesn't want
anyone to see the whistleblower video.

09:38.620 --> 09:40.163
But don't worry, okay?

09:40.247 --> 09:42.499
It's just until I meet with their lawyers.

09:42.583 --> 09:45.711
-We're gonna fix this.
-So, no more stories about Strata?

09:45.794 --> 09:48.839
For right now,
no more stories about anything.

09:49.464 --> 09:51.383
Well, can they do that?

09:54.928 --> 09:57.139
-I know, sweetie.
-Honey…

10:01.602 --> 10:02.728
Hey.

10:03.770 --> 10:04.771
I got it.

10:04.855 --> 10:05.856
Hilde.

10:24.166 --> 10:28.504
Is everything okay? I didn't think
you'd wanna meet up right now, you know--

10:28.587 --> 10:32.049
You know, because of everything
that happened with your grandpa.

10:32.674 --> 10:35.052
I don't wanna talk about it.
Can we just work?

10:48.232 --> 10:49.233
No.

10:58.659 --> 11:00.869
Oh, my God. Look.

11:08.377 --> 11:11.380
Strata did this. They ruined everything.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.174
Are you sure it was them?

11:14.258 --> 11:17.553
Yeah. We never lock the door.
We can't prove that.

11:17.636 --> 11:21.014
Donny, I need you to take photos of this
with your phone.

11:21.598 --> 11:24.434
We're gonna send out an e-mail blast
to all our subscribers.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.905
What's this? What's happening?

11:38.824 --> 11:40.450
Maybe the Wi-Fi is down.

11:40.534 --> 11:43.704
No, it's not the Wi-Fi.
They blocked our website.

11:43.787 --> 11:46.331
-For legal reasons.
-It's all gone.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.585
Everything that we've worked for.

12:03.515 --> 12:05.017
Guys, don't even bother.

12:07.728 --> 12:12.149
Look, I know I can't fix everything,
but I can fix this.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.985
Yeah, I've been wanting to do
a deep clean of this place anyways.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.403
I'll go get some trash bags.

12:16.486 --> 12:18.739
-They're in my--
-Work go bag. I know.

12:21.283 --> 12:22.701
You just get me.

12:42.971 --> 12:46.683
Hey, Matt.
You don't have to do this right now.

12:48.310 --> 12:52.773
You know, he spent his whole life
in this town, Bridge.

12:54.691 --> 12:56.818
Forty years in this house.

12:59.363 --> 13:02.658
Forty years. Can you believe that?

13:03.617 --> 13:06.495
-Yeah.
-You remember when he first got sick,

13:06.578 --> 13:09.623
we tried to convince him
to come stay with us in New York?

13:10.958 --> 13:14.378
And he just flat refused.

13:15.712 --> 13:17.422
Yeah, he wouldn't even consider it.

13:17.506 --> 13:21.927
You know, he loved this town.

13:25.013 --> 13:28.392
This town poisoned him, Bridge.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.686
Oh, honey.

13:32.563 --> 13:36.692
You know, this town took away my dad
when I was a kid,

13:36.775 --> 13:40.320
and this town has taken him
away from me again,

13:40.404 --> 13:43.031
you know, at 69 years old.
How is that even fair?

13:44.241 --> 13:45.242
It's not.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.411
It was the poison in that spray.

13:47.494 --> 13:50.497
That's why he was confused one minute
and then lucid the next.

13:50.581 --> 13:52.499
God, no, he should still be here.

13:52.583 --> 13:54.585
He should. He should still be here.

13:54.668 --> 13:57.087
If the people of this town
just gave a damn enough

13:57.171 --> 14:01.133
about what Strata was doing,
he would still be here.

14:01.216 --> 14:03.051
-He'd be right here.
-Honey.

14:03.135 --> 14:06.221
-Daddy, it's okay.
-No, it's not okay!

14:06.305 --> 14:08.098
It's definitely not okay.

14:08.182 --> 14:10.350
You know,
I should've protected you from them.

14:10.434 --> 14:13.187
Right? Yeah.
Yeah, and I should've protected him!

14:20.068 --> 14:21.445
Come on.

14:22.070 --> 14:25.991
I'm sorry, sweetie. I'm sorry, okay?

14:26.074 --> 14:28.160
There's a lot going on.

14:33.081 --> 14:36.126
I thought that maybe I had already written

14:36.210 --> 14:38.462
the most important story of my life,

14:38.545 --> 14:40.172
but this was bigger.

14:42.007 --> 14:44.885
I became a reporter because of my dad.

14:44.968 --> 14:48.555
Because he taught me
to believe in the power of stories.

14:57.981 --> 15:03.028
I believe that when we share our stories,
it brings us closer together.

15:03.612 --> 15:07.616
And if we're lucky,
they can change the world.

15:08.659 --> 15:12.788
Stories help us see the truth
and help us remember.

15:13.914 --> 15:16.041
They help us feel like we're not alone.

15:17.209 --> 15:21.380
I knew a great man who worried
that his story might never be told,

15:21.463 --> 15:24.967
that maybe it wasn't important enough.

15:27.636 --> 15:30.055
But his story was important to me.

15:32.224 --> 15:34.977
Sylvester Lisko was my grandfather.

15:36.353 --> 15:40.524
He was a husband
and a father and a friend,

15:40.607 --> 15:43.110
and he cared about his community.

15:43.694 --> 15:47.197
Apparently, he was also
a pretty good softball coach,

15:47.281 --> 15:49.116
which none of us ever knew.

15:49.783 --> 15:52.411
These facts tell you about what he did.

15:54.663 --> 15:58.584
But they don't tell you
about what kind of person he chose to be.

16:06.967 --> 16:09.303
My Pop-Pop could be stubborn.

16:09.887 --> 16:15.017
I think I got that from him,
but he could also admit when he was wrong.

16:15.976 --> 16:19.479
He knew when to listen and when to act

16:19.563 --> 16:22.316
and how to be a friend to anyone in need.

16:23.775 --> 16:27.154
He helped me see that family
isn't just the people you're born to.

16:28.906 --> 16:30.908
It's also the people you choose…

16:32.993 --> 16:35.287
the people you do your whole life with.

16:38.874 --> 16:40.626
You choose those people

16:40.709 --> 16:43.337
because you believe in the same thing,

16:44.338 --> 16:46.173
and you fight the same fights.

16:48.091 --> 16:50.177
My Pop-Pop made me feel brave.

16:51.595 --> 16:54.640
He made me wanna stand up
and do the right thing.

16:57.309 --> 17:01.522
There's a lot I never knew
about my Pop-Pop.

17:02.397 --> 17:06.609
But when we finally came home,
he acted like we'd never been gone.

17:12.366 --> 17:16.118
And maybe it was because
he was losing his memory, but…

17:18.038 --> 17:21.583
I hope it's because he forgave us
for staying away so long.

17:26.713 --> 17:31.218
Yeah, I know my dad would have
loved that we're all here together,

17:31.301 --> 17:33.053
so thank you for that.

17:33.136 --> 17:38.058
And yeah, I think more than anything,
this is exactly what he would've wanted.

17:38.141 --> 17:41.812
So, thanks again for that.

17:57.035 --> 17:59.079
Your life was the biggest.

18:19.224 --> 18:21.435
Will Strata ever pay for what they did?

18:23.937 --> 18:29.568
You know, I…
I don't know, sweetie, I really don't.

18:30.319 --> 18:32.446
Hey, but you know what I do know?

18:32.529 --> 18:35.741
Is that we are not gonna give up
without a fight, okay?

18:38.952 --> 18:41.330
I know I couldn't save Pop-Pop, but…

18:42.706 --> 18:46.168
all I wanted was for the world to know
the truth about what happened to him

18:46.251 --> 18:47.920
and the other workers at Strata.

18:48.504 --> 18:50.672
I want to keep going for him.

18:52.716 --> 18:53.717
Yeah.

18:55.385 --> 18:59.723
Look, you still have your paper.
I mean, not right now, but…

19:01.183 --> 19:04.061
you know no one can tell you
to stop writing, right?

19:05.646 --> 19:07.189
Yeah, we'll figure something out.

19:08.190 --> 19:09.191
How?

19:09.274 --> 19:14.071
Well, like we always do.
You know, like a family.

19:18.408 --> 19:21.662
Remember those family newsletters
I used to make for Pop-Pop

19:21.745 --> 19:23.163
to mail to him every New Year?

19:23.872 --> 19:25.249
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

19:25.332 --> 19:28.836
You took ages figuring out
the margins and all that stuff.

19:28.919 --> 19:34.633
Well, I can't use my website,
but what if I make a newsletter?

19:34.716 --> 19:37.302
You know,
a special edition just for this story.

19:37.386 --> 19:41.265
Well, the court order only applied to
The Magic Hour Chronicle,

19:41.348 --> 19:45.727
so I think as long as
it's not under that name,

19:45.811 --> 19:49.773
then hard copies of your article
could just sort of, you know, show up.

19:51.191 --> 19:53.944
What?
I'm, like, your associate or whatever.

19:54.027 --> 19:55.112
I know stuff.

19:55.195 --> 19:58.657
Intern.
But maybe I should give you a raise.

19:59.408 --> 20:02.744
Yeah, well, you did say girls
undervalue themselves at work, so…

20:03.495 --> 20:06.999
No, you know what?
That's good. I mean, that's right.

20:07.708 --> 20:11.545
No, really, we should do this, right?
Yeah, Hilde, go get your computer.

20:11.628 --> 20:14.464
Izzy, can you grab us some paper
and get some pens and stuff?

20:15.299 --> 20:17.968
Ginny, you wanna get your crayons?
Yeah, you wanna grab something?

20:18.051 --> 20:20.470
Let's get the printer set up.
Let's start making this happen.

20:20.554 --> 20:22.431
Step right up. Read all about it.

20:22.514 --> 20:26.185
Strata's putting Erie Harbor in danger,
and your family might be at risk.

20:26.268 --> 20:29.104
There's also horoscopes on page 2
if that's more your thing.

20:30.397 --> 20:32.608
What?
I'm trying to get people in the door.

20:32.691 --> 20:33.692
-Hey, Izzy.
-Hey.

20:33.775 --> 20:34.985
You should read this.

20:35.068 --> 20:37.029
And please tell other people
to read it too.

20:37.112 --> 20:39.448
Okay, wait, are you sure
you should be handing these out?

20:39.531 --> 20:42.451
I mean, isn't Strata coming after
your family for everything they have?

20:42.534 --> 20:45.078
Well, yeah, but,
I mean, we talked about it,

20:45.162 --> 20:47.039
and the only thing
we ever really cared about

20:47.122 --> 20:48.415
was losing my grandfather.

20:48.999 --> 20:52.127
Now that he's gone,
I mean, this is what he would've wanted.

20:52.211 --> 20:54.588
-He deserves to have his story told.
-Wait, what?

20:54.671 --> 20:56.381
Did you say your parents sat you down

20:56.465 --> 20:59.468
and discussed whether or not
you should fight an evil corporation?

20:59.968 --> 21:02.262
I mean, yeah. I guess.

21:02.346 --> 21:04.598
Dude, I wish my parents
were more like yours.

21:04.681 --> 21:07.601
I wish they cared enough to just
do something important in the world.

21:07.684 --> 21:08.685
Yeah, well,

21:08.769 --> 21:12.606
if there's anything Hilde's taught me
in her insane, backwards way, it's that…

21:14.107 --> 21:16.151
you can't wait for the adults
to do something.

21:17.653 --> 21:20.113
Give me the whole stack. Thank you.

21:30.541 --> 21:34.670
This injunction
is nothing more than an attempt to

21:34.753 --> 21:38.590
censor, intimidate
and silence Strata's critics.

21:43.220 --> 21:44.471
Yeah.

21:46.056 --> 21:48.517
This injunction is nothing more
than an attempt to

21:48.600 --> 21:52.771
censor, intimidate
and silence Strata's critics.

22:14.585 --> 22:15.586
Ms. Jensen.

22:16.503 --> 22:17.588
Always a pleasure.

22:37.065 --> 22:38.358
And what are reflexes?

22:38.442 --> 22:41.320
They are defined as
involuntary actions or movements

22:41.403 --> 22:43.572
that occur in response to a stimulus.

22:44.489 --> 22:46.825
So when you inhale…

23:01.298 --> 23:04.092
-I just hope nothing weird happens today.
-Is this true?

23:04.676 --> 23:07.012
Yeah. Strata poisoned their workers.

23:07.095 --> 23:10.140
And we think that my grandfather
might have died from the exposure.

23:10.224 --> 23:11.767
That's so messed up.

23:12.643 --> 23:14.686
You're leading the walkout, right?

23:15.354 --> 23:19.024
Izzy Lisko, please report
to Principal Collins's office.

23:22.569 --> 23:23.570
What was that about?

23:24.196 --> 23:28.283
It's protected speech.
She provides her source. You.

23:28.367 --> 23:30.827
The evidence is right there
in the deposition video.

23:30.911 --> 23:32.913
That video was taken
completely out of context.

23:32.996 --> 23:35.123
But that didn't stop your daughter
from using it

23:35.207 --> 23:37.751
to try and drum up clicks
for her little blog.

23:37.835 --> 23:41.088
I'm sorry, do you mean to tell me
you plan to sue my daughter?

23:41.171 --> 23:43.549
For what? Defamation? Libel?

23:44.132 --> 23:46.969
She's the one who wants
to be taken seriously as a journalist.

23:48.428 --> 23:51.849
Look, you can surmise
why we're all really here.

23:52.933 --> 23:54.893
We want a quick and easy end to all this.

23:55.853 --> 24:01.483
Private settlement. Name your price.
This can all go away.

24:13.120 --> 24:16.039
It's "effect," not "affect."

24:18.166 --> 24:20.878
Is this about the school walkout?
Are we in trouble?

24:20.961 --> 24:23.964
I did get a few concerned phone calls.

24:24.047 --> 24:27.301
Word travels fast around here. Sit.

24:31.221 --> 24:34.600
If students miss class,
I will have to discipline them.

24:34.683 --> 24:35.684
It's school policy.

24:35.767 --> 24:38.145
People only care
because it's making Strata look bad.

24:38.228 --> 24:39.980
They're a big deal in this town.

24:41.023 --> 24:46.111
People get very defensive.
They like things the way they are.

24:46.195 --> 24:48.488
Okay, well,
I just don't understand that, okay?

24:48.572 --> 24:50.741
They should want things to be better.
It's bull.

24:53.994 --> 24:54.995
It's wrong.

24:57.164 --> 24:58.707
I don't disagree with you.

24:59.666 --> 25:01.251
But the rules are the rules.

25:07.257 --> 25:10.135
Of course, if more students
were to walk out at the same time,

25:11.303 --> 25:13.430
I can't suspend everyone, can I?

25:16.058 --> 25:17.309
Thanks, Principal Collins.

25:18.727 --> 25:19.937
For what?

25:26.318 --> 25:30.447
So, financial crises
like the panic of 1873,

25:30.531 --> 25:33.575
it caused the prices
of agricultural products to tank.

25:33.659 --> 25:37.412
So farmers who found themselves
in a state of economic crisis

25:37.496 --> 25:41.416
decided that it was very necessary
to start what's called the Populist Party

25:41.500 --> 25:43.293
to protect their collective interests.

25:43.377 --> 25:46.046
If you'll please open your textbooks
to page 78,

25:46.129 --> 25:49.091
you'll see that
many of the social movements of this era

25:49.174 --> 25:52.135
arose from
this widespread wealth of inequality.

25:53.303 --> 25:58.308
And in fact, it also came to be known
as what's called the Progressive Era.

26:02.771 --> 26:04.189
Ms. Lisko?

26:05.315 --> 26:06.316
Is something wrong?

26:07.734 --> 26:08.777
You got this.

26:13.574 --> 26:15.784
Yeah. Something's very wrong.

26:18.704 --> 26:19.955
Hold on.

26:20.914 --> 26:23.834
Wait. What's going on?
Where are you going?

26:24.585 --> 26:27.296
Class is not dismissed yet.
Have a seat, sir.

26:28.755 --> 26:29.756
Really?

26:56.617 --> 26:58.994
-You should say something.
-What? No.

26:59.578 --> 27:01.997
-Should I?
-I mean, yeah.

27:02.080 --> 27:05.292
This is, like, the entire school.
And they all came out because of you.

27:10.756 --> 27:13.675
Hey. What kind of woman do you wanna be?

27:30.859 --> 27:31.860
Hi.

27:33.237 --> 27:36.865
Yeah, so, thank you all for doing this.

27:37.824 --> 27:38.825
I know it…

27:40.577 --> 27:44.623
I know it was risky for you all to just,
you know, leave class.

27:45.207 --> 27:47.251
-Yeah…
-Are you gonna say something?

27:47.334 --> 27:49.962
-…you know…
-Nah. This is Izzy's thing.

27:50.045 --> 27:54.091
…in the middle of the day and all,
so thank you for that.

27:55.843 --> 28:00.430
Did I already say thank you? Yeah, so…

28:08.313 --> 28:14.319
Who here is tired of being lied to
by adults?

28:17.197 --> 28:18.574
Me.

28:20.033 --> 28:23.120
Tired of being talked down to,
all because we're--

28:24.121 --> 28:26.331
we're, what, too young to understand?

28:28.917 --> 28:32.963
Who's tired of hearing that you don't know
what you're talking about?

28:33.046 --> 28:35.048
You know, they say,

28:35.132 --> 28:39.511
"What do you know
about climate change or injustice?"

28:40.637 --> 28:44.975
Yeah, well, I'll tell you what we know.
We know what we see.

28:45.726 --> 28:49.563
We're young, but we are not stupid,
and we're paying attention.

28:51.356 --> 28:52.774
Yes, Izzy!

28:54.568 --> 28:56.195
So take this article,

28:56.778 --> 29:00.991
written and researched by
my very annoying sister, Hilde Lisko.

29:04.661 --> 29:06.538
Strata shut down her website,

29:06.622 --> 29:09.791
but they cannot stop her
from speaking the truth.

29:09.875 --> 29:12.169
So just do me a favor, okay?

29:12.252 --> 29:14.838
Take this article, take a picture of it

29:14.922 --> 29:20.010
and text it to your parents,
your neighbors, your friends, okay?

29:20.093 --> 29:22.638
Because Strata made a decision
a long time ago

29:22.721 --> 29:26.808
that profits were more important
than people.

29:26.892 --> 29:30.270
They jeopardized the safety
of everybody in this town!

29:30.354 --> 29:32.523
And if we don't do something,
they'll do it again.

29:34.483 --> 29:37.152
No more lies!

29:37.236 --> 29:38.487
-No more lies!
-Yes.

29:38.570 --> 29:39.696
No more lies!

29:39.780 --> 29:43.992
No more lies! No more lies! No more lies!

29:44.076 --> 29:47.037
No more lies! No more lies!

29:47.120 --> 29:50.541
No more lies! No more lies!

29:50.624 --> 29:54.169
No more lies! No more lies!

30:06.348 --> 30:07.349
Hey.

30:07.432 --> 30:10.018
Yeah, I've been tailing
the Strata fixer all day.

30:10.102 --> 30:11.687
Nothing incriminating yet.

30:11.770 --> 30:15.732
Stay on him. I know in my gut
that guy has been harassing my dad.

30:15.816 --> 30:17.234
I just don't have proof.

30:17.317 --> 30:20.237
I need something concrete
if we want a shot at criminal charges.

30:20.320 --> 30:23.490
This might be our only shot, 'cause once
Strata gets wind of our investigation,

30:23.574 --> 30:27.828
they'll just stop using him.
Find somebody else to do their dirty work.

30:27.911 --> 30:29.621
You got it, Sheriff.

30:29.705 --> 30:31.623
It's good to have you back, Frank.

30:32.124 --> 30:33.750
It's good to be back, Trip.

30:51.602 --> 30:53.937
All right. Come on.

31:11.663 --> 31:14.249
Rutherford, you rat.

31:24.343 --> 31:25.344
Hey, what's wrong?

31:32.267 --> 31:38.565
So, when Strata realized
what I'd done with my mom's computer,

31:39.358 --> 31:41.693
they told her, and

31:42.986 --> 31:44.196
she got fired.

31:45.197 --> 31:46.698
Well, laid off, but…

31:48.742 --> 31:50.327
I never should've sent those files.

31:50.410 --> 31:52.913
-Iz, my mom was so upset.
-But…

31:54.414 --> 31:56.208
you said she'd agree with us.

31:56.917 --> 31:58.585
That, I don't know,

31:58.669 --> 32:00.754
people knowing the truth
was more important.

32:02.130 --> 32:03.131
Hello, Izzy.

32:04.883 --> 32:06.885
I'm so sorry about what happened to you.

32:07.928 --> 32:09.763
They're being really nice about it.

32:10.931 --> 32:12.599
Gonna give me a good reference.

32:14.393 --> 32:16.895
Not that I'll ever find as good a job
around here again.

32:18.355 --> 32:20.399
Well, okay, but they're not being nice.

32:20.482 --> 32:23.569
I mean, Strata's the one that hurt people,
not you or Ethan.

32:25.571 --> 32:28.782
You know, Izzy,
I've lived here for a long time.

32:29.366 --> 32:32.619
It's not like being from New York City.
You know?

32:32.703 --> 32:34.538
No one has ever heard of Erie Harbor.

32:34.621 --> 32:38.959
We don't have any big skyscrapers
to be proud of, but we do have Strata.

32:39.042 --> 32:42.880
And wherever you go and you say,
"That's the company I work for,"

32:43.672 --> 32:47.843
it means something to people.
I was always so proud of that.

32:47.926 --> 32:49.178
Mom.

32:53.682 --> 32:55.684
I don't know.
I guess I just never thought of that.

32:56.393 --> 32:59.980
I understand why your sister wanted
to publish her story.

33:00.814 --> 33:03.025
But Strata built this community.

33:03.108 --> 33:04.693
And it's hard for a lot of us

33:04.776 --> 33:07.279
watching your family drag their name
through the mud.

33:17.414 --> 33:18.665
Is that what you think too?

33:20.959 --> 33:22.503
I don't know, Iz. I'm just…

33:24.463 --> 33:26.173
I'm worried about my mom.

33:38.185 --> 33:39.520
Take care of yourself.

33:48.362 --> 33:52.824
Truly a pleasure working with you.
I wish you all the best. Sheriff.

33:53.534 --> 33:56.703
I take it you heard
that I've already filed my report.

33:58.455 --> 34:00.207
Would you like to see it?

34:07.339 --> 34:08.340
It's unfortunate.

34:08.422 --> 34:11.176
Maybe you should've
valued my advice a little more.

34:11.260 --> 34:12.344
Your advice?

34:13.428 --> 34:15.429
Right, your advice.

34:17.056 --> 34:21.186
I've been subjected to more scrutiny
in one year at this job

34:21.270 --> 34:23.897
than my predecessor
had to deal with in 35.

34:23.981 --> 34:27.317
And still, I rose to that challenge.

34:27.818 --> 34:31.280
But from the start,
you haven't supported me.

34:31.362 --> 34:34.324
Because a Black woman
can't be sheriff in this town.

34:34.408 --> 34:36.201
Hold on one second.
I never said anything--

34:36.284 --> 34:37.578
What was it you said?

34:37.661 --> 34:40.873
That I'd be more comfortable
somewhere else,

34:40.956 --> 34:42.916
in a more progressive town.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.002
You didn't wanna make me feel comfortable.

34:45.085 --> 34:48.797
You wanted to make sure everyone else
around here wasn't uncomfortable.

34:48.880 --> 34:52.092
And instead of trying to help me
clean up the racism in this town,

34:52.176 --> 34:55.512
you wanted me out of your way so that
you all could get back to business.

34:55.596 --> 34:56.972
But guess what?

35:00.392 --> 35:02.603
I don't like the way you do business.

35:03.395 --> 35:06.315
And I think your boss,
the attorney general,

35:06.398 --> 35:08.817
will agree with me when she sees this.

35:38.639 --> 35:42.601
That was awesome. I've never seen Izzy
so invested in something.

35:42.684 --> 35:45.145
You know, she seemed so sure of herself.

35:45.229 --> 35:47.523
Did you see the way
the other kids responded to her?

35:47.606 --> 35:50.234
Did you see that? I didn't even know
that was possible in this town.

35:50.317 --> 35:51.318
I had no idea.

35:51.401 --> 35:53.320
It was amazing. She's amazing.

35:54.112 --> 35:55.113
What?

35:55.697 --> 35:57.282
I'm just-- I'm worried, you know.

35:57.366 --> 35:59.993
This suit that they're threatening
against Hilde.

36:00.077 --> 36:03.497
Strata could drag this on forever.
They could bleed us dry.

36:03.580 --> 36:05.624
Yeah. Yeah. I know, I know.

36:09.503 --> 36:11.171
Wow, I don't believe it.

36:11.672 --> 36:13.632
Hey, Hilde?

36:13.715 --> 36:14.716
What is it?

36:15.217 --> 36:18.929
Hey, you remember the air force guy
that I spoke to at the funeral?

36:19.012 --> 36:20.681
-Yeah.
-Well, he knew the other man

36:20.764 --> 36:22.516
-from the whistleblower video.
-What?

36:22.599 --> 36:24.476
Yeah, Arthur Conway. They served together.

36:24.560 --> 36:27.396
Yeah, apparently Arthur left town
right after Hank Gillis died.

36:27.479 --> 36:30.399
He'd been in the control tower
the day of the accident.

36:30.899 --> 36:32.067
Look. Here, check it out.

36:32.150 --> 36:35.153
There was no trace of him
on the Internet, but…

36:35.237 --> 36:37.489
Arthur Conway. Air traffic control tower.

36:37.990 --> 36:40.158
He's the other voice on the black box.

36:41.201 --> 36:42.202
You're right.

36:43.704 --> 36:45.414
Do you think he's still alive?

36:46.123 --> 36:48.584
I mean, I got no idea. I don't know.

36:48.667 --> 36:51.670
You know, my contacts at the VA,
they just came through.

36:51.753 --> 36:53.672
I mean, this is who this was.

36:53.755 --> 36:56.049
Yeah. They were able to get me
a forwarding address

36:56.133 --> 36:57.176
for his pension checks.

36:57.259 --> 36:58.969
Now we know where the guy lives.

37:00.095 --> 37:01.096
What's going on?

37:03.515 --> 37:06.226
I think I might have found
our first eyewitness.

37:13.233 --> 37:14.860
What are you doing?

37:14.943 --> 37:17.779
Well, I am looking, yeah…

37:19.907 --> 37:21.491
for these.

37:23.785 --> 37:26.163
Passports. We're going to Canada.

37:38.759 --> 37:40.135
-Hello. Bonjour.
-Hey.

37:40.219 --> 37:43.138
-Passports?
-Yeah, we got 'em.

37:43.722 --> 37:46.850
-Where do you live?
-Washington State, Erie Harbor.

37:46.934 --> 37:49.061
-Where you headed today?
-Vancouver.

37:51.605 --> 37:52.731
All right, thank you.

38:22.761 --> 38:24.346
Wait. What is that?

38:24.429 --> 38:28.141
Copies of my article.
I thought it might help jog his memory.

38:28.225 --> 38:31.770
Yeah, Hilde,
you know I'm gonna ask you to stay here.

38:33.313 --> 38:36.608
-But I wanna come with you.
-Yeah, well, you know the drill.

38:36.692 --> 38:40.529
You know, I've--
I gotta make sure it's safe first, right?

38:40.612 --> 38:43.490
We have no idea what kind of
state of mind Arthur's gonna be in.

38:44.157 --> 38:47.870
All right, let me just go check it out.

38:47.953 --> 38:48.954
Fine.

38:49.037 --> 38:51.748
But if he's just a normal old man,
I'm coming in.

38:53.333 --> 38:55.294
All right. You got it.

39:10.684 --> 39:14.730
Hi. Hey. I'm looking for Arthur Conway.

39:15.314 --> 39:17.024
He--

39:17.107 --> 39:18.901
My grandpa died last year.

39:19.651 --> 39:21.737
I'm really sorry to hear that.

39:21.820 --> 39:23.780
I can get my dad if you want me to.

39:25.532 --> 39:27.242
Yeah, sure. Yeah. Please.

39:27.326 --> 39:29.995
-You can wait in here.
-Okay. Thanks.

39:32.831 --> 39:35.375
Dad, there's someone here to see you.

39:55.687 --> 39:56.688
Hey.

40:02.361 --> 40:03.362
Oh, my God.

40:08.617 --> 40:12.788
Matty… is that you?

40:23.590 --> 40:24.591
Richie?

40:27.177 --> 40:28.470
How'd you find me?

40:32.266 --> 40:33.267
Dad?
