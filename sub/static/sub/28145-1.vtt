WEBVTT

00:04.500 --> 00:09.760
That summer was a remarkable one.
It was the summer we dared to dream.

00:09.800 --> 00:12.880
For generations,
we'd known nothing but violence.

00:12.920 --> 00:14.920
Nothing but hatred.

00:14.960 --> 00:18.200
But finally we were saying,
"Enough is enough."

00:18.240 --> 00:21.640
Finally, we were saying,
"Let's give peace a chance."

00:21.680 --> 00:23.160
She's up here! Jesus Christ!

00:23.200 --> 00:25.080
She's pretending
she's on Parkinson again.

00:25.120 --> 00:28.000
Parkinson? Does she know
what time it is? I'll Parkinson her.

00:28.040 --> 00:29.840
I've enough on my plate
without Parkinson.

00:29.880 --> 00:32.040
Close the door!

00:32.080 --> 00:33.360
No, Orla.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.960
Leave, then close the door.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.200
And it was Wogan,
for your information!

00:50.000 --> 00:53.240
And for the love of God don't
forget your waterproof trousers.

00:53.280 --> 00:55.560
They nearly bloody bankrupted us.

00:55.600 --> 00:58.320
Do the Protestants have to
bring waterproof trousers?

00:58.360 --> 01:01.000
Or will the Catholics be expected
to do all the dirty work?

01:01.040 --> 01:03.120
What dirty work?
It's an outdoor pursuits weekend.

01:03.160 --> 01:05.160
I thought you said
you were be building bridges?

01:05.200 --> 01:08.000
Not real bridges, Mammy,
metaphorical bridges.

01:08.040 --> 01:10.120
Then why can't you wear
metaphorical trousers?

01:10.160 --> 01:12.240
Will any of your crowd
be going, love?

01:12.280 --> 01:15.080
My crowd? Or can you not get
Protestant lesbians?

01:15.120 --> 01:17.400
No, I think you can get them
all right, it's just...

01:17.440 --> 01:20.440
I heard that k.d. lang
on the radio yesterday.

01:20.480 --> 01:22.760
Christ, but she's some
set of pipes on her.

01:22.800 --> 01:24.600
You're very talented people.

01:24.640 --> 01:25.880
Thank you?

01:25.920 --> 01:28.400
Has anybody seen my bow and arrow?

01:28.440 --> 01:30.680
Orla really thrives
in the wild, you know.

01:30.720 --> 01:33.200
That time we went camping
in Portsalon,

01:33.240 --> 01:36.000
sure she was like Mowgli
running around them woods.

01:36.040 --> 01:38.120
She was that happy, Mary,
I honestly thought about

01:38.160 --> 01:39.920
just leaving her there. Ach, Mammy.

01:39.960 --> 01:42.960
Because of government
restrictions, we cannot broadcast

01:43.000 --> 01:46.360
the voice of Mr Adams. His words
are spoken by an actor.

01:46.400 --> 01:48.320
Well, with respect, and I mean...

01:48.360 --> 01:51.400
I will never understand
the point of it.

01:51.440 --> 01:53.840
I'll never understand
the point of you.

01:53.880 --> 01:55.560
Grand so.

01:55.600 --> 01:57.520
I'll go.

01:57.560 --> 02:01.520
..about the need to see an end
to all acts of violence.

02:01.560 --> 02:02.720
I want to see that.

02:02.760 --> 02:06.440
It's because his natural voice
is actually very seductive.

02:06.480 --> 02:09.759
Apparently, he sounds like
a West Belfast Bond.

02:09.800 --> 02:12.640
As far as the English are concerned,
a voice like that...

02:12.680 --> 02:14.240
Well, it's dangerous.

02:14.280 --> 02:17.000
Just so I'm clear, are you saying
that the British government

02:17.040 --> 02:19.800
dub the voice of Gerry Adams
because it's too sexy?

02:19.840 --> 02:22.440
It's like a fine whiskey.

02:22.480 --> 02:24.920
And I have that
on good authority, boy.

02:24.960 --> 02:25.960
OK.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.200
Cock-a-doodle-doo. Hi.

02:28.240 --> 02:30.320
Bet that's what he said
when he was nabbed.

02:30.360 --> 02:32.400
When who got nabbed?
Have yous not heard?

02:32.440 --> 02:33.720
You know your man?

02:33.760 --> 02:35.760
Floppy hair, English,
he's all, "Fuck-a-doodle this,

02:35.800 --> 02:38.440
"fuck-a-doodle that". He's flat out
going to weddings with his mates,

02:38.480 --> 02:40.440
until one of them, the fat,
beardy one in the skirt,

02:40.480 --> 02:41.760
until he croaks it and they're all,

02:41.800 --> 02:43.520
"We need to show this man
a bit of respect here,

02:43.560 --> 02:45.160
"let's stop all the clocks."

02:45.200 --> 02:46.960
He goes with your woman.
Do you know her?

02:47.000 --> 02:50.360
She's a total ride, but she
paperclips her frocks together.

02:50.400 --> 02:54.120
Well, he was caught getting down
and dirty with some hooker

02:54.160 --> 02:56.080
in the back of his BMW.

02:56.120 --> 02:57.480
Dark horse or what?

02:57.520 --> 02:58.840
Good Morning, Michelle.

02:58.880 --> 03:01.120
I am buzzing for this weekend.

03:01.160 --> 03:02.960
Them waterproof trousers
do wonders for my hole.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.880
Mine are pink. They're bright pink.

03:04.920 --> 03:06.760
They were two for one, James,
stop crying.

03:06.800 --> 03:08.280
Two for one? Where?

03:08.320 --> 03:09.640
Kay's catalogue.

03:09.680 --> 03:12.200
And my mammy said to tell you...
Her big bowl. I know, I know,

03:12.240 --> 03:14.080
I keep forgetting,
I'll drop it round today.

03:14.120 --> 03:16.520
No, she says
you're to hang on to it.

03:16.560 --> 03:17.800
What?

03:17.840 --> 03:19.800
She doesn't want her big bowl back?

03:19.840 --> 03:21.920
But why? There's nothing wrong
with that bowl.

03:21.960 --> 03:24.040
Sure, I was admiring that bowl
only yesterday.

03:24.080 --> 03:25.200
It's a grand bowl.

03:25.240 --> 03:27.120
I'm just the messenger, folks.

03:27.160 --> 03:29.040
Right. We need to shift ourselves.

03:30.760 --> 03:33.800
Listen, wains,
I've already said this to Erin.

03:33.840 --> 03:35.280
Mammy, please!

03:35.320 --> 03:37.520
No funny business
with these Protestant lads.

03:37.560 --> 03:38.600
Is that clear?

03:38.640 --> 03:41.280
I don't want anybody
landing back here pregnant.

03:41.320 --> 03:42.920
Not very likely in my case.

03:42.960 --> 03:44.640
I wouldn't rule it out, son.

03:44.680 --> 03:47.240
Teenage boys can be
very convincing, Erin.

03:47.280 --> 03:49.960
I remember your father at that age
and... End that sentence, now.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.320
Yes, please do.

03:51.360 --> 03:52.400
Creep.

03:52.440 --> 03:55.360
We're not doing this to get off
with some protestant boys, Mammy.

03:55.400 --> 03:57.320
We're doing this
to reach across the divide.

03:57.360 --> 03:59.440
Did your mother get a new big bowl?
I don't think so.

03:59.480 --> 04:01.920
We're doing this for peace!
All right, Erin.

04:01.960 --> 04:04.200
No need to make
a big song and dance about it.

04:09.800 --> 04:11.560
We're doing it for peace,
all right, Mary.

04:11.600 --> 04:14.600
A piece of that fine Protestant ass!

04:14.640 --> 04:16.880
God, you are such a hypocrite, Erin.

04:16.920 --> 04:18.000
No, I'm not.

04:18.040 --> 04:20.839
I just don't think there's anything
wrong with some cross-community...

04:20.880 --> 04:22.120
Fiddling. ..relations.

04:22.160 --> 04:25.680
So we need head south=east
for 0.5 Miles

04:25.720 --> 04:28.040
and you'll receive
further instructions shortly.

04:28.080 --> 04:30.240
We haven't even left
the estate yet, Orla.

04:30.280 --> 04:33.520
These Prods have some serious moves
up their sleeves, you know.

04:33.560 --> 04:35.960
They're not as fucked up
about sex as we are.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.680
They've put the work in,
they know what they're doing.

04:38.720 --> 04:41.480
They're people, Michelle! They're
not sex toys! I beg to differ.

04:41.520 --> 04:44.040
I'm really looking forward
to making friends with some lads.

04:44.080 --> 04:46.280
Lads aren't going to make friends
with you, James.

04:46.320 --> 04:47.840
Lads make friends with other lads.

04:47.880 --> 04:50.200
I am a lad. Aye, so you are, James.

04:50.240 --> 04:51.760
OK, how much money do we have?

04:51.800 --> 04:53.560
Look the riding of the
Protestants is one thing,

04:53.600 --> 04:55.640
but I really don't see why
we have to buy them a present.

04:55.680 --> 04:58.520
They already have all the land, all
the jobs and all the fucking rights.

04:58.560 --> 05:00.920
Aye, Michelle, that's definitely
the attitude we should have

05:00.960 --> 05:02.360
entering into this weekend.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.960
A present for Protestants.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.520
Now my next "Protestant gift
delivery" isn't due to arrive

05:08.560 --> 05:09.800
until Wednesday.

05:09.840 --> 05:12.520
And as it stands I'm completely
out of stock. What, with there being

05:12.560 --> 05:15.320
such a high fucking demand for that
sort of thing around these parts.

05:15.360 --> 05:16.920
That's a shame.

05:16.960 --> 05:19.560
How much for the Subbooto, Dennis?

05:19.600 --> 05:21.320
We'll call it 16 quid.

05:21.360 --> 05:22.760
Could we call it £1.76?

05:22.800 --> 05:24.280
No, we fucking couldn't.

05:24.320 --> 05:25.560
How about, we give you the £1.76

05:25.600 --> 05:27.880
and we pay the rest off
in instalments?

05:27.920 --> 05:30.960
Yeah, which would be what?
£3.56 over four weeks?

05:31.000 --> 05:32.840
Jesus, check out Rain-wain.

05:32.880 --> 05:36.080
Or you could give us the Subbooto
and then we work off the debt?

05:36.120 --> 05:37.840
Yeah, we could do chores and stuff.

05:37.880 --> 05:40.960
Chores? What do you think this is,
Little House On The Fucking Prairie?

05:41.000 --> 05:43.080
Do you watch Little House
On The Prairie, Dennis?

05:47.080 --> 05:49.200
Come on, girls!
This is embarrassing.

05:49.240 --> 05:51.800
Well, it's all right for you, Clare,
but we want to buck these lads.

05:51.840 --> 05:53.680
We have to offer them
some kind of incentive.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.320
They're not prostitutes, Michelle.

05:55.360 --> 05:57.680
And even if they were, I think
a half-eaten packet of Rolos

05:57.720 --> 06:00.400
and an Ulster Bank key ring is
a pretty insulting form of payment.

06:00.440 --> 06:01.640
I have a HB Pencil!

06:01.680 --> 06:02.920
Happy days.

06:02.960 --> 06:04.760
Hi, guys.

06:04.800 --> 06:08.280
That's not... That's not what you're
giving to the Protestants, is it?

06:08.320 --> 06:09.840
It's just a little token, really.

06:09.880 --> 06:11.320
Yeah, so's ours.

06:11.360 --> 06:12.880
Is that an Ulster bank key ring?

06:12.920 --> 06:14.320
It is indeed, yep.

06:14.360 --> 06:16.800
I must admit,
I had a bit of an advantage

06:16.840 --> 06:19.160
when it came to the whole present
buying thing, because...

06:19.200 --> 06:21.720
You're loaded.
..because I know what they like.

06:21.760 --> 06:24.680
I happen to be very good friends
with a half-Protestant.

06:24.720 --> 06:26.600
What? They don't come
in halves, Jenny.

06:26.640 --> 06:30.440
They do, actually. I met her
at ballet class, her name's Zara.

06:30.480 --> 06:33.560
And she has horse. Good for Zara.
Bye-bye now.

06:35.080 --> 06:37.720
Of course she's friends with a
half-Protestant! Of course she is!

06:37.760 --> 06:40.320
She has been fucking unbearable
since them braces came off.

06:40.360 --> 06:43.040
Dose. Well, I'm going to make
friends with a full Protestant,

06:43.080 --> 06:45.720
see how she likes it.
Zara won't seem quite so impressive

06:45.760 --> 06:48.440
next to my thoroughbred,
will she, Jenny?! Relax, Clare.

06:48.480 --> 06:50.160
Why has she got so much money,
anyway?

06:50.200 --> 06:52.280
Who's her da?
Pierce fucking Brosnan?

06:52.320 --> 06:55.080
He's a surgeon over at Altnagelvin,
he took Orla's tonsils out.

06:55.120 --> 06:58.160
And not a day goes by
when I don't think about them.

06:58.200 --> 07:01.000
Give peace a chance!
Give peace a chance!

07:01.040 --> 07:04.680
Give peace a chance!
Give peace a chance!

07:04.720 --> 07:08.760
No hate! No hate!
Let's integrate!

07:09.800 --> 07:11.800
Yay!

07:11.840 --> 07:13.160
Kill me.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.520
Give peace a chance!
Give peace a chance!

07:16.760 --> 07:18.680
The Prods have landed!

07:20.000 --> 07:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:33.440 --> 07:34.640
Single file!

07:38.160 --> 07:40.360
You must be Miss Taylor?

07:40.400 --> 07:42.960
That's right. Well, Janet.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.480
Michael.

07:44.520 --> 07:46.680
Sister Michael.

07:46.720 --> 07:48.200
It's a pleasure. I know.

07:49.400 --> 07:51.560
Move it. Shift it.

07:53.240 --> 07:56.720
Why's everyone so desperate
for them to mix?

07:56.760 --> 07:59.320
I think we should
keep them separate.

07:59.360 --> 08:01.200
I think we should
keep them in cages.

08:03.240 --> 08:06.640
So our Lady Immaculate Girls
have been split into groups -

08:06.680 --> 08:10.840
A through to F - as have
The Londonderry Boys Academy.

08:10.880 --> 08:15.760
We'd like As to find As,
Bs to find Bs, etc, and so on.

08:15.800 --> 08:17.840
It's very straightforward.

08:17.880 --> 08:21.560
However, if that isn't clear,
feel free to say so.

08:21.600 --> 08:23.840
But know that you will be judged.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.760
Lads, you really
shouldn't have.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.680
I'm starting to see that all right.

08:31.720 --> 08:33.799
I'm going to keep mine on my bed.

08:33.840 --> 08:35.799
Where I sleep, in my knickers.

08:37.039 --> 08:38.960
Right. I mean, these are free,
for a start.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.320
My dad has, like, 45 of them.

08:40.360 --> 08:42.120
We were told it was
an all girls' school.

08:42.159 --> 08:43.720
You've been a bit short
changed there.

08:43.760 --> 08:45.040
Nah, it's fine, mate.

08:45.080 --> 08:47.440
It's all good, man. I'll...

08:47.480 --> 08:49.040
..I'll just give it to my bird.

08:49.080 --> 08:50.120
Your bird?

08:50.160 --> 08:54.400
Yeah, she's really fit...and stuff.

08:54.440 --> 08:56.960
Right. OK, great.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.160
I'm sorry, but is he OK?

09:00.200 --> 09:01.880
Philip's actually deaf.

09:01.920 --> 09:03.640
In one ear.

09:03.680 --> 09:06.080
He's deaf in one ear.
That's right.

09:06.120 --> 09:09.040
Which ear? That's actually
a very inappropriate question.

09:09.080 --> 09:11.000
Is it? It is, yeah.

09:11.040 --> 09:14.040
My God! This is
the best present ever!

09:14.080 --> 09:16.160
Aw, you guys!

09:16.200 --> 09:17.720
Rolo, anyone?

09:17.760 --> 09:19.920
OK, listen up, people!

09:19.960 --> 09:22.760
According to this,
you're going to need a...

09:22.800 --> 09:25.000
..well, they've used the term...

09:25.040 --> 09:28.240
.."buddy",
for tomorrow's activities.

09:28.280 --> 09:29.600
I bagsy Harry!

09:29.640 --> 09:31.960
What? But that's not fair,
he's the only good-looking one.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.120
The rest of us are right here.
You snooze, you lose, Erin.

09:35.160 --> 09:36.800
I suppose I'll have you, then.

09:36.840 --> 09:38.120
Aren't you a charmer?

09:38.160 --> 09:40.640
So should us two bad bastards
hook up or what?

09:40.680 --> 09:42.000
I'm sorry?

09:42.040 --> 09:43.760
Um, will you be my buddy, please?

09:43.800 --> 09:45.440
Sure.

09:45.480 --> 09:48.000
Listen, Philip, about the whole
"which ear" thing...

09:48.040 --> 09:50.160
It's fine. I'll be your partner.

09:50.200 --> 09:55.160
Great! And, just to be clear,
are you a fully blown Protestant?

09:55.200 --> 09:57.560
Of course.

09:57.600 --> 10:00.280
Sister Michael!
I don't have a Protestant!

10:00.320 --> 10:03.120
Well, you'll have to share
with James. What? No!

10:03.160 --> 10:06.160
Look, there just aren't enough
Protestants to go round.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.240
The mediator's here.

10:08.280 --> 10:10.200
He's...

10:10.240 --> 10:12.040
..one of your lot.

10:12.080 --> 10:13.200
Not a priest?

10:14.520 --> 10:16.640
Quite young, Southern.

10:16.680 --> 10:20.040
Bit of an arsehole,
but, my God...amazing hair.

10:21.440 --> 10:23.920
For feck's sake.

10:27.680 --> 10:31.600
OK, so I see a few familiar faces
out there.

10:31.640 --> 10:34.040
As some of you may know, I took
a bit of a sabbatical last year.

10:34.080 --> 10:36.400
Do you mean when you shacked up
with a slutty hairdresser,

10:36.440 --> 10:39.600
but then she dumped you?
Miss Mallon, please!

10:39.640 --> 10:42.640
Raise your hand
if you want to ask a question.

10:42.680 --> 10:44.560
OK, I think we should just move on.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.960
The hairdresser certainly did.

10:47.000 --> 10:51.520
OK, so this is just a little
exercise I like to kick off with.

10:51.560 --> 10:53.000
Give me strength.

10:53.040 --> 10:54.720
I want you guys to give me examples

10:54.760 --> 10:58.560
of things that Catholics
and Protestants have in common

10:58.600 --> 11:01.040
and things that they
don't have in common.

11:01.080 --> 11:02.560
Let's start with similarities.

11:02.600 --> 11:04.480
Erin, why don't you get
the ball rolling?

11:04.520 --> 11:06.040
OK.

11:06.080 --> 11:08.040
So, we both...

11:08.080 --> 11:10.000
Right.

11:10.040 --> 11:12.080
So, we all...

11:12.120 --> 11:14.880
..God, this is actually quite hard.

11:14.920 --> 11:16.760
Anything at all, a small thing even.

11:16.800 --> 11:18.320
OK, so...

11:18.360 --> 11:19.760
Right.

11:21.840 --> 11:24.520
God, I'm, actually, drawing
a blank here, to be honest.

11:24.560 --> 11:27.720
Not to worry, someone else?
A similarity? Yes.

11:27.760 --> 11:30.480
Protestants are British
and Catholics are Irish.

11:30.520 --> 11:32.360
So that's actually a difference.

11:32.400 --> 11:35.200
Quite a... Quite a big difference.

11:35.240 --> 11:37.560
But that's OK,
we can write that down.

11:39.080 --> 11:41.520
Now, back to similarities.

11:41.560 --> 11:42.560
Yes?

11:42.600 --> 11:44.160
Protestants are richer.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.800
OK, so that's another difference.

11:46.840 --> 11:50.120
And I'm not sure that's actually...
I mean, is that true?

11:50.160 --> 11:51.760
I would say so.

11:51.800 --> 11:54.160
Yeah, I suppose that's fair enough.

11:54.200 --> 11:55.800
Yes, great. Off you go.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.480
Catholics really buzz off statues
and we don't so much.

11:58.520 --> 12:01.840
I do enjoy a good statue,
it has to be said.

12:01.880 --> 12:05.160
So again, what we have there
is a difference.

12:05.200 --> 12:08.840
Ooh! Protestants like to march
and Catholics like to walk.

12:08.880 --> 12:11.360
OK, can we just...?
Jenny, could you just...?

12:11.400 --> 12:13.760
You've already
written it down, have you?

12:13.800 --> 12:15.280
Great, thank you, Jenny.

12:15.320 --> 12:21.000
I want to just pause
and think about what's in here.

12:22.560 --> 12:24.680
What about the fact
that we all feel

12:24.720 --> 12:28.720
and love and hope and...

12:28.760 --> 12:30.920
Write this down.

12:30.960 --> 12:32.720
We all cry.

12:32.760 --> 12:34.000
We all laugh.

12:34.040 --> 12:35.360
We all dream.

12:36.880 --> 12:40.760
I just want to think along
those lines, for a moment.

12:40.800 --> 12:41.920
OK?

12:41.960 --> 12:44.240
Catholics watch RTE!
Protestants love cleaning!

12:44.280 --> 12:46.920
Protestants are taller!
Catholics have more freckles.

12:46.960 --> 12:48.680
Protestants hate Abba.

12:48.720 --> 12:49.720
OK, thank you.

12:50.880 --> 12:53.640
Let me just rephrase slightly.

12:53.680 --> 12:57.040
Can you think of anything...

12:58.080 --> 13:01.640
..that unites every single person
in this room?

13:03.680 --> 13:05.800
Is there anything that we all want?

13:05.840 --> 13:08.240
For this to be over.

13:08.280 --> 13:09.680
And we'll wrap it up there.

13:17.680 --> 13:19.120
I'm not sure about this.

13:19.160 --> 13:20.360
I knew you'd fanny out!

13:20.400 --> 13:22.880
These lads have moves.
You said so yourself, Michelle.

13:22.920 --> 13:24.120
And I haven't got any moves!

13:24.160 --> 13:26.040
Look, let's just get in there,
have a few drinks

13:26.080 --> 13:27.440
and just loosen up a bit. No!

13:27.480 --> 13:30.040
No loosening up!
I don't like it!

13:30.080 --> 13:31.920
Just be confident, Erin.
Boys like that.

13:31.960 --> 13:33.800
How the fuck would you know
what boys like?

13:33.840 --> 13:36.640
Cos I'm a boy, Michelle!
I'm a real live boy.

13:36.680 --> 13:38.520
Aw, yeah, like Pinocchio.

13:43.880 --> 13:46.160
Right. OK.

13:46.200 --> 13:49.760
Listen...be sexy, OK? Sexy, right.

13:53.760 --> 13:56.440
I said be sexy,
not be a fucking blowfish, Erin.

14:03.960 --> 14:05.360
Hello, mate.

14:05.400 --> 14:07.480
We heard you boys
are having a party.

14:07.520 --> 14:08.600
No?

14:08.640 --> 14:09.800
Well, yous are now.

14:21.940 --> 14:23.978
I really like this one.
Have you seen the video?

14:24.058 --> 14:25.140
OK, let's cut the crap, Dee.

14:25.180 --> 14:26.980
Sorry?
You know why I'm here.

14:27.020 --> 14:28.020
But before we begin.

14:28.060 --> 14:30.180
Begin what?
I won't have as many moves as you.

14:30.220 --> 14:31.660
I just want to get that out there.

14:31.700 --> 14:33.260
I really don't know.

14:33.300 --> 14:34.500
I haven't put the hours in.

14:34.540 --> 14:37.540
And that's not because I'm lazy,
it's just not part of our culture.

14:37.580 --> 14:40.540
But if you're OK with that,
I say we just crack on.

14:44.220 --> 14:45.820
Fancy another beer, mate?

14:45.860 --> 14:47.540
Christ but I just love beer.

14:47.580 --> 14:48.940
Don't you just love beer?

14:48.980 --> 14:50.060
Yeah, beer is nice.

14:50.100 --> 14:53.780
I love beer and football
and poker and, you know, tits.

14:53.820 --> 14:56.940
Tits? Can't get enough of them.
Then again I am a lad.

14:56.980 --> 14:59.820
Yeah, he may be a lad, Jon,
but I can offer you protection.

15:01.020 --> 15:03.100
I have a hunting knife.
Right, OK.

15:03.140 --> 15:05.460
Wait, wait, wait. Where are you
going? Nature's calling.

15:05.500 --> 15:07.660
Whoa! Number 1 or Number 2?

15:07.700 --> 15:09.740
Excuse me?
Just answer the question, Jon.

15:09.780 --> 15:12.460
I don't want to answer the question.
I'm not comfortable with the question.

15:12.500 --> 15:14.180
Cos if it's a number two,
it's safer to bury it.

15:14.220 --> 15:16.540
You don't want a pack of wolves
following your scent

15:16.580 --> 15:17.700
out in these parts.

15:17.740 --> 15:20.380
Those boys,
they'll tear you limb from limb.

15:20.420 --> 15:23.260
We're inside. They have
very sophisticated noses, Jon.

15:23.300 --> 15:25.740
I'm going to go now.

15:25.780 --> 15:28.100
Can't you let me
have anything for myself?

15:28.140 --> 15:29.140
No.

15:35.140 --> 15:38.260
Do you want to go somewhere
a bit more private?

15:40.700 --> 15:42.820
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

15:42.860 --> 15:44.500
Why not?

15:47.740 --> 15:49.060
What the fuck's that?

15:49.100 --> 15:51.540
And I think the reason
I was interested in

15:51.580 --> 15:53.620
whether or not you were
a fully-blown Protestant

15:53.660 --> 15:56.780
is because as far as I'm concerned,
you can't be Protestant enough.

15:56.820 --> 15:58.620
I am all for the Protestants.

15:58.660 --> 15:59.820
I can't get enough of them.

15:59.860 --> 16:01.260
Protestant mad I am.

16:01.300 --> 16:03.780
And I think... I maybe running
with this but I'm sure you

16:03.820 --> 16:06.820
really like Catholics too, it's just
that we've been conditioned to...

16:06.860 --> 16:08.180
I don't.

16:08.220 --> 16:09.580
What?

16:09.620 --> 16:10.980
You don't? No.

16:11.020 --> 16:13.100
I hate them. I think
they're arseholes.

16:13.140 --> 16:15.380
That's not true.

16:15.420 --> 16:16.660
That can't be true. It is.

16:16.700 --> 16:18.100
And they're all thick as shit.

16:18.140 --> 16:19.940
I despise them. I really do.

16:21.180 --> 16:22.420
OK.

16:22.460 --> 16:24.980
So how do you want to do this?

16:25.020 --> 16:28.300
Do you wanna kick things off or...

16:28.340 --> 16:29.780
should I?

16:31.380 --> 16:33.260
My God,
are you coming on to me?!

16:33.300 --> 16:34.700
Is that what this is?

16:34.740 --> 16:36.980
I thought you were having
some sort of breakdown.

16:41.220 --> 16:42.900
He's wearing a purity bracelet.

16:42.940 --> 16:44.380
What does that mean?

16:44.420 --> 16:46.980
No down below action,
that's what it fucking means.

16:47.020 --> 16:48.900
We have to swap. Swap?

16:48.940 --> 16:51.340
Yeah, we'll just swap over.
You take Harry, I'll take Lee.

16:51.380 --> 16:52.420
Dee. Whatever.

16:52.460 --> 16:53.980
We can't do that?

16:54.020 --> 16:55.700
Why not?

16:55.740 --> 16:58.260
You fancied him first, and your
lack of moves won't be an issue.

16:58.300 --> 16:59.820
That is true. Aye.

16:59.860 --> 17:01.500
She's coming! Who?

17:01.540 --> 17:03.260
The woman. The small angry woman.

17:03.300 --> 17:04.660
Sister Michael!

17:04.700 --> 17:05.859
Shit!

17:10.060 --> 17:11.819
Good evening Sister.

17:11.859 --> 17:13.339
We just popped round

17:13.380 --> 17:15.940
because we had a few questions
about the British Empire,

17:15.980 --> 17:17.980
which the boys have
cleared up for us now so...

17:18.020 --> 17:20.700
They weren't talking
about the British Empire, Sister.

17:20.740 --> 17:21.900
They were having a party.

17:21.940 --> 17:23.339
I could hear the music.

17:23.380 --> 17:25.940
You will go far in life, Jenny.

17:25.980 --> 17:28.620
But you will not be well liked.

17:28.660 --> 17:32.220
Honestly, girls,
I need my eight hours,

17:32.260 --> 17:35.740
but I've Mary Quinn on the phone
frying my head and now this.

17:35.780 --> 17:39.060
What? My Mother rang? Why?
Is everything OK?

17:39.100 --> 17:41.860
She was quite distressed.
She wanted me to pass on a message.

17:41.900 --> 17:43.940
And...

17:43.980 --> 17:45.380
are you going to?

17:45.420 --> 17:47.140
Fine.

17:50.620 --> 17:52.820
Erin, I need some information.

17:52.860 --> 17:55.740
Can you find out in a subtle way...

17:57.100 --> 18:00.140
..if Michelle's mother was given
the big bowl

18:00.180 --> 18:02.740
by someone she has since
fallen out with

18:02.780 --> 18:07.180
and if she can no longer bring
herself to look at the big bowl

18:07.220 --> 18:08.700
because it's just too painful.

18:08.740 --> 18:10.620
All the best, your mother Mary.

18:12.020 --> 18:13.140
Well?

18:14.260 --> 18:15.780
No.

18:15.820 --> 18:17.180
Shift it! Let's go.

18:17.220 --> 18:18.340
Come on.

18:18.380 --> 18:19.500
Quick.

18:22.300 --> 18:23.620
Jennie.

18:34.940 --> 18:37.700
What's wrong with Clare? She hasn't
said two words since last night.

18:37.740 --> 18:39.380
Well, I'm not complaining.

18:40.980 --> 18:42.220
I just did it for a laugh.

18:42.260 --> 18:43.220
The trousers.

18:43.260 --> 18:45.540
I'd do anything for a laugh, me.

18:45.580 --> 18:47.620
I'm mad like that.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.500
Right.

18:49.540 --> 18:50.700
All right, there they are.

18:50.740 --> 18:52.620
OK, if we're going to do this
Michelle,

18:52.660 --> 18:54.540
we need to do it delicately.
Of course.

18:54.580 --> 18:56.100
Oi! Lads!

18:56.140 --> 18:57.540
We want to swap.

18:57.580 --> 18:58.580
Brilliant!

18:58.620 --> 18:59.700
Swap?

18:59.740 --> 19:02.980
Yeah, Erin's gonna have Harry now
and I'm gonna have you, all right?

19:05.020 --> 19:06.060
Great stuff.

19:06.100 --> 19:08.780
I think we all can agree,
that for generations there's been

19:08.820 --> 19:11.580
a deep lack of trust
between your communities.

19:11.620 --> 19:13.980
And that's where abseiling comes in.

19:14.020 --> 19:15.100
Christ.

19:15.140 --> 19:17.940
Abseiling is a great
trust-building exercise.

19:17.980 --> 19:21.260
Because what you're doing is,
you're saying to your buddy,

19:21.300 --> 19:24.060
"Lean on me, I'm here for you".

19:24.100 --> 19:27.900
Now, let me see who's first.
Clare, Clare Devlin, there you are.

19:27.940 --> 19:29.740
I'm not sure about this.

19:29.780 --> 19:31.620
You'll be grand.

19:31.660 --> 19:34.260
No, listen, you don't understand.

19:34.300 --> 19:35.620
Now, where's your buddy?

19:35.660 --> 19:38.780
Good man, yourself. Come on, now.

19:46.780 --> 19:48.940
Philip will control
Clare's descent

19:48.980 --> 19:52.460
by feeding her rope through
what's know as a belay device.

19:54.580 --> 19:57.460
So he'll be the one actually
dictating the speed of her drop.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.820
I think, if it's OK, I'd just like
to take a moment

19:59.860 --> 20:01.780
- and just...
- Jesus! Aaargh!

20:01.820 --> 20:03.380
Are you ready, Philip?

20:03.420 --> 20:04.740
Yeah.

20:04.780 --> 20:07.020
OK, everybody. So, on three.

20:07.060 --> 20:09.900
Seriously, folks, I'm not feeling
entirely comfortable with this!

20:09.940 --> 20:11.340
One...

20:11.380 --> 20:12.820
two...

20:12.860 --> 20:13.900
..three.

20:13.940 --> 20:17.060
Stop! Stop it! Get me out of here!

20:17.100 --> 20:19.060
He's trying to kill me!

20:19.100 --> 20:22.100
He wants to kill us all,
all of the Catholics!

20:22.140 --> 20:23.900
Look at his eyes, he's a madman!

20:23.940 --> 20:26.100
A Fenian-hating madman.

20:26.140 --> 20:28.700
Don't let the Jaffa bastard hurt me!
Please!

20:30.460 --> 20:32.980
My God. Jesus, Clare!
Fuck a doodle do!

20:33.020 --> 20:34.300
He said he hated us.

20:34.340 --> 20:35.460
No, I didn't.

20:35.500 --> 20:38.180
Last night, you said you hated
Catholics. Admit it.

20:38.220 --> 20:40.660
I said I hated athletes.

20:40.700 --> 20:42.860
I'm not much of a sports fan.

20:42.900 --> 20:44.980
But we weren't even
talking about athletes!

20:45.020 --> 20:46.260
Well, I thought we were!

20:46.300 --> 20:49.260
Why would you have thought
we were talking about athletes?

20:49.300 --> 20:51.460
Because I'm deaf in one ear!

20:52.980 --> 20:56.260
Catholics does sound a bit like
athletes, to be fair to him, like.

20:59.540 --> 21:00.780
They're all arseholes.

21:00.820 --> 21:03.820
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

21:03.860 --> 21:05.740
You tried to swap us!

21:05.780 --> 21:08.980
Because all protestants are
the same? Aren't they, girls?

21:09.020 --> 21:10.180
Yes. NO!

21:10.220 --> 21:12.620
And this guy's really creepy
and a bit sort of sexist.

21:12.660 --> 21:15.620
And she carries a knife and makes
people bury their own excrement.

21:15.660 --> 21:16.660
Fucking Catholics. >

21:16.700 --> 21:17.700
Who said that? Who?

21:24.940 --> 21:26.460
Should we break it up?

21:26.500 --> 21:28.820
Hey! Don't touch the hair!
Don't touch the hair!

21:30.260 --> 21:31.780
Let's leave it a minute.

21:33.860 --> 21:35.700
I just cannot get my head around it.

21:35.740 --> 21:38.540
For the love of God, Mary,
it's only a bowl.

21:38.580 --> 21:41.540
Who just gives away their big bowl,
Gerry? It doesn't make sense.

21:41.580 --> 21:43.580
Aye, she's definitely up to
something, love.

21:43.620 --> 21:46.140
I have always said that
Deidre Mallon was a bit fly.

21:46.180 --> 21:48.340
I'd confront her about it.
I intend to.

21:48.380 --> 21:49.380
Great! Do that!

21:49.420 --> 21:52.060
Then maybe we can lay the whole
bloody thing to rest.

21:52.100 --> 21:55.300
Take that tone with her again
and I'll lay you to rest, boyo!

22:04.980 --> 22:07.220
Do you know what this is about,
Geraldine?

22:07.260 --> 22:11.620
As far as I can make out, these lads
tried to throw my Clare off a cliff.

22:11.660 --> 22:12.700
Desperate.

22:12.740 --> 22:15.860
Are you all right, Mary?
How's the bowl working out for you?

22:17.380 --> 22:20.100
Great. Great.
Thanks very much, Deirdre.

22:21.740 --> 22:23.860
Well, that got to
the bottom of it all right.

22:26.060 --> 22:29.060
Is that everyone? Lovely stuff.

22:30.820 --> 22:33.900
OK, so, there was a bit
of a misunderstanding on the

22:33.940 --> 22:38.820
expedition today which unfortunately
led to a physical altercation.

22:40.620 --> 22:44.220
I thought rather than let it fester,
we should talk about it,

22:44.260 --> 22:46.700
and start to heal and repair.

22:48.460 --> 22:49.740
So...

22:49.780 --> 22:52.380
who'd like to go first?

22:52.420 --> 22:54.540
Jaffa bastard?
You actually said those words?

22:54.580 --> 22:55.900
It just came out, Mammy.

22:55.940 --> 22:58.180
Why were you threatening
people with a knife, love?

22:58.220 --> 22:59.580
OK, one at a time, please.

22:59.620 --> 23:01.380
Well, if you'd wear
the bloody hearing aid

23:01.420 --> 23:04.220
I paid a fortune for you'd have
heard what she said! Unbelievable!

23:04.260 --> 23:06.460
Girls! You were fighting with girls!

23:06.500 --> 23:07.900
This is all your fault.

23:07.940 --> 23:09.420
I knew this would happen.
