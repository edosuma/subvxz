WEBVTT

00:05.473 --> 00:08.042
I didn't steal you
from your mother.

00:09.543 --> 00:12.780
She and I agreed
a long time ago

00:12.813 --> 00:14.482
that you would be better off
with me full time.

00:14.515 --> 00:15.649
Mom says differently.

00:16.484 --> 00:17.685
(SIGHS)

00:19.019 --> 00:20.121
Just let me go.

00:21.155 --> 00:22.490
What, to Hong Kong?

00:22.523 --> 00:24.792
And back to New York.

00:24.825 --> 00:26.860
I know you care about me,

00:26.894 --> 00:29.230
but you've had your time.
It's Mom's turn now.

00:30.264 --> 00:33.501
I do love you,
and that's why
my answer is no.

00:33.534 --> 00:34.668
Not even to Hong Kong?

00:35.503 --> 00:36.570
I'm sorry.

00:37.571 --> 00:38.572
You aren't.

00:40.108 --> 00:41.475
I can't let you go.

00:41.509 --> 00:43.111
You can't stop me.

00:43.144 --> 00:45.346
I'm still your father.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.215
When I graduate
from high school,

00:47.248 --> 00:49.583
I'm leaving,
I'm not coming back.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.858
So, what do you think?

00:57.891 --> 00:59.460
I'm not sure.

01:00.728 --> 01:01.929
I can't go to England.

01:03.964 --> 01:05.333
Brandon, you were
gonna move anyway.

01:06.134 --> 01:07.968
It's too far.

01:08.001 --> 01:10.138
And I can't leave Middleton.
Not now.

01:13.674 --> 01:15.276
I'm sorry, Tara.

01:16.444 --> 01:17.811
I love you.

01:23.484 --> 01:25.486
I'm so sorry.

01:25.519 --> 01:26.854
You knew?

01:26.887 --> 01:29.157
-Since this morning.
-Why didn't you tell me?

01:29.857 --> 01:31.692
I wanted to fix it first.

01:31.725 --> 01:33.794
I've been on the phone
with Jones all day.

01:33.827 --> 01:36.164
I must have shown him
10 different buildings.

01:36.197 --> 01:37.265
And?

01:37.298 --> 01:38.632
Java Shed wants your building.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.036
And Jones wants
Java Shed as a tenant.

01:43.070 --> 01:45.873
Well, you still
should have told me.

01:45.906 --> 01:47.107
You're right.

01:49.277 --> 01:50.878
Just give me a chance.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.013
To do what?

01:53.046 --> 01:54.848
To make this right.

01:54.882 --> 01:56.384
You didn't make it wrong.

01:57.618 --> 01:59.853
Then why do I feel so guilty?

02:00.688 --> 02:02.790
Because you're a good guy.

02:23.777 --> 02:25.179
(EXHALES)

02:29.483 --> 02:30.784
-Hey, Sam!
-Hey.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.553
-You were expecting me?
-I was.

02:32.586 --> 02:35.088
Last night, actually. Tea?

02:35.122 --> 02:36.624
Sure.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.058
Ah!

02:38.091 --> 02:39.260
Ooh! Hot, hot!

02:39.293 --> 02:41.462
Yeah. Hot tea is not
meant to be downed.

02:41.495 --> 02:45.899
Well, I thought those
relaxing, happy properties

02:45.933 --> 02:48.202
you always talk about
with tea could
be fast-tracked.

02:48.236 --> 02:49.337
It doesn't work that way.

02:49.903 --> 02:51.772
I get that now.

02:51.805 --> 02:52.940
So what's new with the shop?

02:52.973 --> 02:55.042
Does Ryan have a plan?
(SNIFFS)

02:55.075 --> 02:56.644
Ryan is trying to get Jones

02:56.677 --> 02:59.179
to see that I'd make
a great tenant,

02:59.213 --> 03:01.782
and if Java Shed
can be talked into
a different location,

03:01.815 --> 03:03.851
then, uh, Jones would
give me a lease.

03:03.884 --> 03:06.654
Oh. I hope this doesn't
sound too...

03:07.355 --> 03:09.390
Why don't you just relocate?

03:09.423 --> 03:11.359
It's not like
it's sacred ground.

03:11.392 --> 03:13.761
Your loyal customers
will follow you
wherever you are,

03:13.794 --> 03:15.996
and the new ones
always seem to find you.

03:18.499 --> 03:21.302
Um, how's the new house guest?

03:21.335 --> 03:23.671
Which means we're through
talking about that.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.639
No, it means that
I want to know how
the house guest is.

03:25.673 --> 03:28.108
And I'm guessing
that's why you burned
your throat on my tea.

03:29.677 --> 03:32.045
-Uncomfortable?
-You have no idea.

03:32.079 --> 03:33.547
So you're stuck
between a rock and a...

03:33.581 --> 03:35.583
-Linda.
-(SIGHS)

03:35.616 --> 03:37.385
All right. I'll see you later.

03:37.418 --> 03:38.752
-Thanks.
-Sure.

03:44.925 --> 03:46.560
(ENGINE STARTS)

03:47.761 --> 03:49.297
Martha Tinsdale.

03:50.464 --> 03:52.700
-Thank you, Deb.
-You're welcome.

03:53.301 --> 03:54.368
Oh, dear!

03:54.935 --> 03:56.203
Seriously, Martha!

03:56.236 --> 03:57.905
I can't stop them. I tried.

03:57.938 --> 04:01.342
I have spoken to Mr. Jones
and he refuses
to entertain any offer.

04:01.375 --> 04:02.943
He wants that building.

04:02.976 --> 04:04.578
Well, you've got
to do something!

04:04.612 --> 04:06.414
Well, I can't just
tell them to go away.

04:06.447 --> 04:08.316
The property was for sale,
he bought it.

04:08.349 --> 04:10.117
And besides, Java Shed
has already started

04:10.150 --> 04:11.485
all the necessary paperwork

04:11.519 --> 04:13.186
for the renovations
and construction.

04:13.220 --> 04:14.755
Not good enough!

04:14.788 --> 04:17.190
I have done everything
in my power

04:17.224 --> 04:19.527
or what is legally
within my power.

04:19.560 --> 04:20.894
If I take one more step,

04:20.928 --> 04:23.096
then Java Shed and Mr. Jones
will have a lawsuit.

04:23.130 --> 04:24.932
A winnable lawsuit.

04:24.965 --> 04:27.801
I know that this is difficult
for you to hear,

04:27.835 --> 04:30.237
but Java Shed
is coming to Middleton,

04:30.270 --> 04:32.540
and nothing short of
a miracle will stop it.

04:37.345 --> 04:38.612
Hey.

04:39.313 --> 04:40.748
-Hey.
-(DOOR CLOSES)

04:40.781 --> 04:42.516
How go the real estate wars?

04:42.550 --> 04:44.785
Ryan says he's making
progress with Jones.

04:45.218 --> 04:47.421
Hmm. Look...

04:49.056 --> 04:50.223
(SIGHS)

04:50.257 --> 04:52.360
I shouldn't have said
anything about relocation.

04:52.393 --> 04:55.195
It's obvious that you like
where your shop is now.

04:55.228 --> 04:57.498
Because it is sacred ground.

04:58.098 --> 04:59.367
Oh?

05:01.068 --> 05:03.804
It's where Jake and I
first connected.

05:03.837 --> 05:06.306
It was magical.

05:06.340 --> 05:08.742
It's where I finally found
my roots, my purpose...

05:08.776 --> 05:10.544
A home in Middleton.

05:12.413 --> 05:14.815
You clearly loved Jake
very much.

05:15.816 --> 05:16.950
He was lucky to have you.

05:18.318 --> 05:21.622
Every day, when I open
my front door for business,

05:21.655 --> 05:23.123
it's like he's still there.

05:38.238 --> 05:39.873
What are you doing?

05:39.907 --> 05:41.074
Shooting hoops.

05:41.108 --> 05:44.378
Um, no, you are slamming
the ball against the backboard

05:44.412 --> 05:46.947
over and over again
trying to drive me crazy.

05:46.980 --> 05:49.483
And guess what? It worked.

05:50.083 --> 05:51.351
So you can stop now.

05:51.385 --> 05:54.522
Okay, so I'm a little
off my game, all right?

05:54.555 --> 05:56.356
Only if you're trying to get
the ball in the hoop.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.529
I hate this.

06:02.830 --> 06:03.897
Basketball?

06:03.931 --> 06:05.766
My parents.

06:05.799 --> 06:08.969
I'm stuck between them
and they really
hate each other.

06:09.002 --> 06:11.605
Dad wants me to stay here,
and Mom wants me
to go with her.

06:12.339 --> 06:13.874
Well, what do you want?

06:13.907 --> 06:15.909
I want to go to Hong Kong
and back to New York.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.713
No, you don't.

06:21.515 --> 06:22.550
How would you know?

06:23.617 --> 06:24.952
I just do.

06:34.094 --> 06:36.363
Cambridge? What did you say?

06:37.030 --> 06:38.766
I'd like my job back.

06:38.799 --> 06:40.300
Oh?

06:40.333 --> 06:42.135
Cassie needs me here.

06:42.169 --> 06:45.172
Yeah, I heard about
the Bell, Book & Candle,

06:45.205 --> 06:47.040
and I can't even imagine
Middleton without it.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.877
So Cassie asked you to stay?

06:49.910 --> 06:52.846
She didn't,
and she wouldn't,

06:52.880 --> 06:55.449
but I have to be here for her
and Grace whatever happens.

06:55.483 --> 06:56.884
Okay, but...

06:57.651 --> 06:58.752
-What?
-Never mind.

06:58.786 --> 06:59.787
No, go on, say it.

07:00.688 --> 07:02.456
Tara needs you, too, right?

07:04.124 --> 07:06.460
I mean, everything
is gonna get settled, right?

07:06.494 --> 07:09.530
I mean, hopefully
Cassie's shop stays
right where it is,

07:09.563 --> 07:10.998
but this isn't gonna
go on forever.

07:11.965 --> 07:13.767
And once things are settled,

07:13.801 --> 07:15.636
you could go be
with Tara in England.

07:15.669 --> 07:16.704
That's true.

07:19.372 --> 07:20.774
Tara's family.

07:20.808 --> 07:23.210
So, is this really
about Cassie?

07:31.084 --> 07:32.786
Wow.

07:32.820 --> 07:35.288
I... I still cannot believe
that you left

07:35.322 --> 07:37.390
New York for this.

07:37.424 --> 07:39.860
I did. And I like it.

07:41.829 --> 07:43.263
What do you really want?

07:43.296 --> 07:44.565
Does it ever occur to you

07:44.598 --> 07:47.434
that I may want a chance
to be a real mother to Nick?

07:49.503 --> 07:52.105
A real mother wouldn't
try to take a son

07:52.139 --> 07:54.374
from a father
who's raised him
his whole life.

07:57.077 --> 07:59.146
She's one of the top
custody lawyers
in the country,

07:59.179 --> 08:01.749
and she thinks that
I have a very strong case.

08:01.782 --> 08:04.852
Full custody or not,
Nick doesn't want
to live with you.

08:04.885 --> 08:07.354
And that's gonna carry
a lot of weight with a judge.

08:07.387 --> 08:10.057
If you do this,
Nick's gonna get hurt.

08:11.124 --> 08:13.594
I haven't filed yet.

08:13.627 --> 08:15.763
I told my lawyer
that I could get you
to come around.

08:17.998 --> 08:21.602
Whether Nick gets hurt or not
is up to you, not me.

08:34.381 --> 08:37.751
Thought we could drown
our respective sorrows
in tea and carbs.

08:37.785 --> 08:40.554
Aw, you gave up
your mid-afternoon latte?
(CHUCKLES)

08:40.588 --> 08:45.125
Well, since Java Shed,
I've decided to give up
on java all together.

08:45.158 --> 08:49.897
So, Ryan is currently
at the Bistro
rocking two cell phones.

08:49.930 --> 08:53.500
Yeah, he's trying to get Jones
to lease me back the space.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.268
But to do that,
he first needs to get

08:55.302 --> 08:57.871
the Java Shed
people interested in
a different location.

08:58.706 --> 09:01.141
So, you and Ryan...

09:01.975 --> 09:04.411
Is this Jones thing
gonna be a

09:04.444 --> 09:05.879
speed bump or a full stop?

09:07.848 --> 09:09.750
I don't know. I...

09:10.751 --> 09:11.785
I just don't know.

09:12.519 --> 09:13.520
You're just not so sure?

09:15.088 --> 09:16.189
Yeah.

09:35.142 --> 09:36.243
What are you up to, Ryan?

09:37.177 --> 09:38.646
Trying to save Cassie's shop.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.849
Isn't that kind of like

09:41.882 --> 09:44.852
setting a house on fire
and then calling
the fire department?

09:44.885 --> 09:47.287
No, Abigail,
it's nothing like that.

09:47.320 --> 09:48.922
You brought
Jones to Middleton.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.059
Jones was interested in
the Keating property.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.560
That's it.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.997
After you called his office
and sent a ton of emails.

09:58.365 --> 10:00.133
Ever heard of Pandora's Box?

10:01.635 --> 10:02.903
I'm not the bad guy here.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.538
Depends on who you ask.

10:11.712 --> 10:14.347
You charged me
for all my coffee refills?

10:14.381 --> 10:16.016
And my water.
(SCOFFS)

10:16.717 --> 10:18.251
Boss' orders.

10:24.024 --> 10:25.058
CASSIE: Okay, thanks.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.061
Bye, Ryan.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.501
I thought that
I would help with dinner.

10:34.534 --> 10:36.837
Oh, well,
I never turn down help.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.910
Something tells me that
you're not here just
to help make a salad.

10:42.943 --> 10:44.712
Why can't Bell, Book
stay where it is?

10:45.578 --> 10:46.747
It's not my building.

10:46.780 --> 10:47.981
Why can't you buy it?

10:48.015 --> 10:50.183
Can't afford it.

10:50.217 --> 10:52.352
Why does everything
have to change?

10:53.787 --> 10:57.624
Losing Dad,
Brandon moving away,
the Bell, Book...

10:59.359 --> 11:02.095
Why can't things
stay the same, Mom?

11:02.129 --> 11:04.097
Oh, honey,
change is a part of life.

11:06.533 --> 11:07.735
A bad part.

11:07.768 --> 11:08.969
Hmm.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.171
So, you're looking
to avoid pain

11:11.204 --> 11:14.141
to avoid the unpleasant
and unhappy things in life?

11:15.508 --> 11:16.543
Yeah.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.612
It's completely understandable

11:19.646 --> 11:21.681
and completely unrealistic.

11:21.715 --> 11:24.417
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

11:24.451 --> 11:27.187
So you're saying that stuff
like this is just gonna

11:27.220 --> 11:29.256
keep on happening to me?

11:29.289 --> 11:31.291
To all of us.

11:31.324 --> 11:33.126
But we aren't defined
by what happens to us.

11:33.160 --> 11:36.363
We are defined by how we react

11:36.396 --> 11:37.731
to what happens to us.

11:38.565 --> 11:39.900
Like the shop?

11:40.868 --> 11:42.102
Exactly.

11:45.572 --> 11:46.940
-Mom?
-Yeah.

11:48.241 --> 11:49.376
What aren't you telling me?

11:50.878 --> 11:53.646
Jones won't budge
on the rent,

11:53.680 --> 11:55.582
so in order to stay,
I'd have to pay double.

12:11.098 --> 12:13.033
-Hey!
-Hey.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.734
How are you?

12:14.768 --> 12:16.103

to pay double the rent.

24:40.346 --> 24:42.882
-So I met the ex.
-Hmm, Linda.

24:42.915 --> 24:44.617
I get why she's the ex.

24:44.651 --> 24:46.819
(LAUGHS) Irreconcilable...

24:46.853 --> 24:48.154
-Everything?
-Yeah.

24:49.155 --> 24:50.723
She's interesting.

24:50.757 --> 24:52.424
I've never known her
to be a big talker.

24:52.458 --> 24:55.728
I never rely on just
what someone tells me
about themselves.

24:55.762 --> 24:57.229
Are you saying
you vet people?

24:57.263 --> 25:00.266
Don't think
I didn't Google you.

25:00.299 --> 25:03.302
Stephanie realized
she has something
Java Shed doesn't.

25:03.335 --> 25:04.637
Hmm. Which is?

25:05.371 --> 25:06.673
Taste.

25:06.706 --> 25:10.509
And it's not shareholders
who make the decisions, I do.

25:10.543 --> 25:12.244
The personal touch. Nice.

25:23.856 --> 25:25.792
I don't think
we've officially met.

25:25.825 --> 25:27.526
I'm Stephanie.
I own the Bistro.

25:28.928 --> 25:31.263
I need a refill.
Coffee, black.

25:32.198 --> 25:34.500
Yes, well, I will gladly
fetch your coffee,

25:34.533 --> 25:38.805
but I just wanted
to tell you that
I'm not going anywhere.

25:38.838 --> 25:41.841
This place
isn't an investment.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.743
It isn't a franchise.

25:43.776 --> 25:45.211
It's me.

25:45.812 --> 25:47.680
Okay. Thanks.

25:48.380 --> 25:50.016
Coffee, black.

25:50.049 --> 25:51.784
You are a charmer,
aren't you?

25:56.322 --> 25:58.658
Get Mr. Jones
a black coffee, please.

25:58.691 --> 26:01.894
I don't trust myself
not to drop it in his lap.

26:02.528 --> 26:04.797
I could do that.

26:04.831 --> 26:07.166
Accidents happen.
Every day.

26:07.767 --> 26:09.468
Thanks, but no.

26:10.803 --> 26:12.538
I'll take that coffee to go.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.641
With pleasure.
Thank you.

26:14.674 --> 26:18.244
And, oh, please remember
to never come back.

26:18.611 --> 26:19.779
Bye-bye.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.515
What did you do, Elliott?

26:23.549 --> 26:25.918
-Bank called?
-The bank?

26:25.952 --> 26:27.820
No.
The Java Shed people did.

26:27.854 --> 26:29.722
-Oh.
-They're pulling out,

26:29.756 --> 26:32.158
looking at a different city,
different developer.

26:32.191 --> 26:34.360
What did you do?

26:34.393 --> 26:36.495
I did the right thing,

26:36.528 --> 26:38.631
and it felt really good.
(CHUCKLES)

26:39.732 --> 26:41.067
You're fired.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.869
You should check your e-mail,

26:42.902 --> 26:45.371
because I sent my resignation
an hour ago.

26:45.404 --> 26:47.840
That felt really good, too.
(CHUCKLES)

26:56.816 --> 26:57.850
(DOOR CLOSES)

27:02.254 --> 27:03.589
(SIGHS)
So what do you think?

27:03.622 --> 27:05.091
I wish I'd thought
of it myself.

27:05.124 --> 27:07.026
-Good.
-We'll have to work fast.

27:07.059 --> 27:08.494
-Absolutely.
-And we'll need help.

27:08.527 --> 27:09.796
-Lots of it.
-Well then,

27:09.829 --> 27:11.530
let's get cracking.

27:21.607 --> 27:23.175
(TARA LAUGHING)

27:29.515 --> 27:30.516
Ooh!

27:41.093 --> 27:43.395
-I forgot how much...
-You love to skate?

27:44.030 --> 27:45.364
No.

27:45.397 --> 27:46.565
How much I love you.

27:49.335 --> 27:50.602
We're a great team.

27:51.603 --> 27:53.806
It's about time
we start acting like it.

28:00.146 --> 28:01.447
(CHUCKLES)

28:04.984 --> 28:06.585
(KNOCKS ON WINDOW)

28:08.687 --> 28:10.122
(BELL CHIMES)

28:10.156 --> 28:11.690
-Stop the presses.
-What?

28:13.292 --> 28:14.326
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:18.097 --> 28:19.131
Not anymore.

28:20.432 --> 28:22.001
I can stay?

28:22.034 --> 28:23.602
Just the way it should be.

28:23.635 --> 28:25.004
Wait. How did you do that?

28:25.037 --> 28:27.306
You want me to tell you
how I worked my magic?

28:27.339 --> 28:29.641
-Yes!
-Your old landlord.

28:30.376 --> 28:31.778
Bill?

28:31.811 --> 28:33.245
He's a nice guy, by the way.

28:33.279 --> 28:34.580
You talked to him?

28:34.613 --> 28:36.482
Yeah.
The second I found out

28:36.515 --> 28:39.051
that Jones doesn't actually
own this building yet.

28:39.085 --> 28:40.853
But Jones said escrow closed.

28:40.887 --> 28:42.121
I know.

28:42.154 --> 28:43.455
He lied to you.

28:43.489 --> 28:46.558
See, Bill told me
that he only agreed
to sell to Jones

28:46.592 --> 28:48.360
if Jones would made sure

28:48.394 --> 28:50.997
that you
and Bell, Book & Candle
could stay indefinitely.

28:51.030 --> 28:54.133
And worse, he went to Bill
and he told Bill

28:54.166 --> 28:56.535
that you had asked
to relocate.

28:56.568 --> 28:57.770
The deal is dead.

28:57.804 --> 28:59.538
-(CHUCKLES)
-What?

28:59.571 --> 29:02.441
Now, Bill is gonna sell
the building eventually,

29:02.474 --> 29:03.776
but not to Jones.

29:03.810 --> 29:05.611
And before he does,

29:05.644 --> 29:07.413
he's gonna sign
a long-term lease with you.

29:08.147 --> 29:09.348
Meaning?

29:09.381 --> 29:12.952
Meaning that you can stay
as long as you want to stay.

29:13.719 --> 29:15.822
(LAUGHING) Wow!

29:18.524 --> 29:19.959
(SIGHS)

29:19.992 --> 29:21.861
And better than that,

29:21.894 --> 29:23.295
that lease will have
to be honored

29:23.329 --> 29:24.730
by anybody else
who buys the building.

29:26.298 --> 29:28.667
Bill thinks that some things
are worth more than money.

29:30.102 --> 29:32.504
-And he said to say hi.
-(LAUGHS)

29:32.538 --> 29:35.908
-Wow! Ah...
-(CHUCKLES)

29:35.942 --> 29:40.346
And just to make sure
that you and he
are both taken care of,

29:40.379 --> 29:43.182
he hired a new agent to handle
the sale of the building.

29:43.215 --> 29:45.351
-Me.
-(LAUGHS) You did it!

29:45.384 --> 29:47.253
You did it,
you saved the shop.

29:47.286 --> 29:50.356
Actually, I didn't
save the shop.

29:50.389 --> 29:51.723
I don't understand.

29:52.424 --> 29:53.926
Well, it wasn't my magic

29:53.960 --> 29:56.062
that saved
Bell, Book & Candle,
it was yours.

29:58.064 --> 30:00.432
You helped Bill
a long time ago.

30:02.601 --> 30:03.936
His granddaughter.

30:03.970 --> 30:07.273
-Yeah.
-She was very troubled.

30:07.306 --> 30:09.175
And you gave her a job
at your shop one summer.

30:09.842 --> 30:11.510
I did.

30:11.543 --> 30:13.880
And now
she's doing really well.
She's a doctor.

30:14.746 --> 30:17.049
-Oh.
-Well, he never forgot,

30:18.184 --> 30:20.352
and he never raised the rent.

30:21.787 --> 30:23.455
So, it was you.

30:23.489 --> 30:25.257
All your good works
just coming back

30:25.291 --> 30:26.893
to help you out
when you need it the most.

30:28.760 --> 30:30.029
And Jones?

30:30.062 --> 30:31.964
Ah, I quit.

30:31.998 --> 30:35.734
I definitely don't want
to be working
with a guy like that.

30:35.767 --> 30:38.537
This... This is where
I want to live.

30:39.939 --> 30:41.007
With you.

30:43.075 --> 30:46.678
I think we have a start
to something really special,

30:46.712 --> 30:48.580
and I would like to see
where it goes.

30:52.952 --> 30:55.554
This is where you should
say something.

30:58.624 --> 31:01.460
Oh... I'm just
not ready for this.

31:02.528 --> 31:04.863
-Really?
-It's not you.

31:06.265 --> 31:07.566
It's just...

31:07.599 --> 31:09.801
I'm not ready to move on
with anyone.

31:09.835 --> 31:12.905
Cassie... Is there
someone else?

31:14.073 --> 31:15.407
No.

31:16.943 --> 31:18.344
Jake maybe?

31:22.881 --> 31:24.416
Yeah, I guess
he'll always be there.

31:26.652 --> 31:28.887
You know, what
keeps me going and...

31:28.921 --> 31:32.024
And gets me through
the toughest times

31:32.058 --> 31:34.526
is the fact that
I know he's there.

31:36.595 --> 31:38.064
Yeah.

31:40.432 --> 31:42.034
Don't forget about me.

31:42.068 --> 31:43.802
I'm not going anywhere.

31:45.104 --> 31:46.572
Me either.

31:59.051 --> 32:00.886
Here. And here.

32:03.589 --> 32:05.291
Cash?

32:05.324 --> 32:07.626
I don't take bribes.
How much is in here?

32:07.659 --> 32:09.461
For all the overcharging
I've been doing

32:09.495 --> 32:11.463
since I found out
Java Shed's coming to town.

32:11.497 --> 32:13.899
Oh, well, are you perhaps
trying to apologize

32:13.932 --> 32:16.268
for your appalling behavior
towards me?

32:16.302 --> 32:20.139
-Appalling?
-Yes, I felt very...appalled.

32:20.172 --> 32:21.907
Okay. Take the box,

32:21.940 --> 32:24.343
take the cash,
and take the apology.

32:24.376 --> 32:25.844
Hmm.

32:28.780 --> 32:31.250
Hmm...
No chocolate croissant?

32:31.283 --> 32:32.651
Let's not push it.

32:32.684 --> 32:34.753
Ah.
(GIGGLES)

32:37.990 --> 32:40.292
-Hello.
-He doesn't want to go.

32:41.093 --> 32:42.128
And I know why.

32:44.496 --> 32:46.398
He loves me, Sam.

32:46.432 --> 32:49.101
And that's why he feels
like he has to go,

32:49.135 --> 32:50.136
to take care of you.

32:51.637 --> 32:53.739
You two broke up months ago.

32:53.772 --> 32:58.910
Geoffrey changed his status
on your social media accounts.

32:58.944 --> 33:00.812
Right about the time
you started texting
and e-mailing Nick.

33:01.780 --> 33:03.315
Okay, this is...

33:03.349 --> 33:06.618
It's not Nick's job
to fill a void in your life.

33:07.253 --> 33:09.288
-Sam...
-No.

33:12.024 --> 33:13.159
No.

33:14.193 --> 33:16.495
There's a reason
I have full custody,

33:16.528 --> 33:18.264
and it still holds.

33:18.897 --> 33:20.866
He's better off with me.

33:21.733 --> 33:23.202
And deep down
you know that.

33:24.770 --> 33:26.772
I recalculated

33:26.805 --> 33:29.775
the cost to Nick
if I don't fight you on this,

33:30.942 --> 33:32.578
and it's too high for him.

33:35.047 --> 33:37.183
You can't keep him from me.

33:38.417 --> 33:39.751
Never have.

33:40.386 --> 33:41.787
Never would.

33:42.888 --> 33:44.690
I want you to know him, too.

33:48.094 --> 33:50.829
Hey, he loves you.

33:53.099 --> 33:54.433
You're his mother.

33:58.770 --> 34:00.406
Come on, Linda,

34:01.673 --> 34:02.874
do the right thing.

34:09.248 --> 34:10.982
Wow!

34:11.016 --> 34:13.652
Kind of dressy for
a celebratory dinner out.

34:13.685 --> 34:16.522
Ah... It felt like
the right thing to wear.

34:16.555 --> 34:18.257
Well, now I've gotta
go home and change.

34:18.290 --> 34:19.825
Oh, you look great!

34:19.858 --> 34:23.262
Why don't you tell me
that I just have
a nice personality?

34:27.833 --> 34:29.735
(BOTH SIGH)

34:29.768 --> 34:31.303
So...

34:32.604 --> 34:35.107
Ryan told me about the store
and the landlord.

34:35.141 --> 34:36.542
Yeah.

34:36.575 --> 34:37.643
You know,
when you think about it,

34:38.910 --> 34:41.713
it's amazing how many
people you've touched.

34:42.448 --> 34:44.250
I love what I do.

34:50.956 --> 34:52.491
Well, hey. What's up?

34:52.524 --> 34:54.293
Nick and I have
said our goodbyes.

34:54.326 --> 34:57.463
He's back at the house.
I have a car waiting.

34:57.496 --> 35:00.632
Well, by all means,
don't let me hold you up.

35:00.666 --> 35:02.868
I wanted to let you know
that I'm gonna take you up

35:02.901 --> 35:05.504
on your offer to spend
more time with our son.

35:05.537 --> 35:07.306
Oh, great! That'll make
Nick really happy.

35:07.339 --> 35:09.608
(CHUCKLES) Yes,
but will it make you happy?

35:09.641 --> 35:10.876
Oh, I think
for the sake of Nick,

35:10.909 --> 35:12.644
we can get along for
a weekend here or there.

35:13.379 --> 35:14.780
I'm relocating to Middleton.

35:14.813 --> 35:16.515
(LAUGHING) Right!

35:19.985 --> 35:21.620
Linda?

35:21.653 --> 35:22.921
When I get back from China,

35:22.954 --> 35:24.690
I'm gonna look for a house
here in Middleton.

35:24.723 --> 35:27.626
I've already spoken with
a real estate agent, Sam.

35:27.659 --> 35:29.328
You can't be serious.

35:29.361 --> 35:31.330
You asked me to do this.

35:31.363 --> 35:32.464
No, I didn't!

35:32.998 --> 35:34.266
You did.

35:34.733 --> 35:35.934
Thank you.

35:37.002 --> 35:38.404
You're welcome.

35:39.305 --> 35:40.706
Good night, Sam.

35:44.476 --> 35:45.777
What?

35:45.811 --> 35:47.646
I've always hated that tie.

35:47.679 --> 35:49.315
I know. That's why I like it.

35:49.348 --> 35:50.882
(LAUGHS)

35:54.320 --> 35:55.721
Just a quick, quick stop.

35:55.754 --> 35:57.155
I just have
to pick something up.

35:57.189 --> 35:59.391
-I forgot something
here earlier.
-At my shop?

35:59.425 --> 36:00.992
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:01.026 --> 36:03.028
ALL: Surprise!

36:03.061 --> 36:04.230
(WHOOPING)

36:05.731 --> 36:06.832
(LAUGHING) What?

36:11.270 --> 36:12.404
This isn't dinner.

36:12.438 --> 36:14.540
No, it's better.
(GIGGLES)

36:14.573 --> 36:16.174
I got ahold
of your mailing list.

36:16.208 --> 36:18.176
And I sent out
an e-mail blast.

36:18.210 --> 36:19.611
And everybody showed up.

36:20.279 --> 36:21.713
And I got a new dress.

36:21.747 --> 36:24.683
And I... Well, I thought
it was a wonderful idea.

36:24.716 --> 36:26.618
-(ALL LAUGH)
-She did.

36:27.185 --> 36:28.454
So...

36:28.487 --> 36:31.657
Mom, these are
some of the people

36:31.690 --> 36:34.460
that have been touched
by you and Bell, Book.

36:36.495 --> 36:38.464
Thank you. Oh, wow.

36:38.497 --> 36:40.466
-You're welcome, Mom.
-(GRACE GIGGLES)

36:41.500 --> 36:43.302
CASSIE: Thank you.
ABIGAIL: You're welcome.

36:43.335 --> 36:45.237
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

36:52.210 --> 36:54.045
Aw, thank you, Susan.

36:54.079 --> 36:55.381
You're welcome, Cassie.

37:04.423 --> 37:06.157
CASSIE: Nice
to see you again.

37:06.191 --> 37:07.859
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

37:13.198 --> 37:15.434
Your cheeks look a little
flushed from the cold.

37:15.467 --> 37:16.535
(CHUCKLES)

37:17.569 --> 37:19.170
Enjoy your day at the rink?

37:20.772 --> 37:22.608
We did. Thank you.

37:24.075 --> 37:26.211
So, I get to keep
my shop, Brandon,

37:26.244 --> 37:27.779
you don't have to stay.

37:27.813 --> 37:29.481
Grace and I will be okay.

37:30.616 --> 37:32.884
I never had to stay, Cassie.

37:32.918 --> 37:34.486
I wanted to.

37:34.520 --> 37:36.822
And I want to as well.

37:36.855 --> 37:39.458
And the best part is
we came to
that decision together.

37:40.359 --> 37:41.827
Thanks, Cassie.

37:47.666 --> 37:49.768
-Nice turnout.
-Yeah. Thanks for coming.

37:49.801 --> 37:51.102
Nah...

37:51.136 --> 37:54.540
You know,
Nick really loves that scroll
that you gave him.

37:54.573 --> 37:56.241
Yeah. It had special
meaning for me

37:56.274 --> 37:58.610
when I was just a little older
than he is now.

37:58.644 --> 38:01.079
-Yeah?
-I was a little lost then.

38:02.180 --> 38:04.650
-You?
-Yes, me.

38:04.683 --> 38:06.117
(CHUCKLING)

38:06.151 --> 38:08.820
Well, I'm here if you need me.

38:09.455 --> 38:10.789
I know that.

38:13.124 --> 38:16.027
Everything is perfect.
Thank you so much.

38:18.664 --> 38:20.799
-Mom.
-Honey.

38:20.832 --> 38:22.868
You did all this?

38:22.901 --> 38:23.935
We all did it.

38:25.303 --> 38:27.005
You're growing up so fast.

38:27.739 --> 38:28.974
Mom.

38:29.808 --> 38:31.610
Your dad would be very proud.

38:33.379 --> 38:35.414
He's proud of both of us.

38:41.587 --> 38:43.455
I'll be right back.

38:45.924 --> 38:47.859
-I love you.
-I love you.

38:54.900 --> 38:57.102
-Hi.
-Hey.

38:57.135 --> 38:59.671
I heard Hong Kong
and New York
aren't happening.

38:59.705 --> 39:02.374
Ever gonna tell me
how you know stuff
before it happens?

39:02.408 --> 39:05.744
-Hmm! Yeah, probably not.
-(BOTH LAUGH)

39:07.212 --> 39:08.580
I do know that you're happy.

39:08.880 --> 39:10.516
How?

39:10.549 --> 39:13.619
Well, you're not
pounding basketballs
into the backboard.

39:13.652 --> 39:14.720
(BOTH LAUGHING)

39:16.221 --> 39:17.589
-Cassie!
-Aw!

39:17.623 --> 39:20.025
You're back.
We almost lost you.

39:20.058 --> 39:21.259
I'm sorry about Java Shed,

39:21.292 --> 39:22.961
I know you had big plans
for Middleton.

39:22.994 --> 39:24.863
I will get my big-box store

39:24.896 --> 39:27.699
or my name's not
Martha Lorraine Tinsdale.

39:31.603 --> 39:33.405
See? You do like my tea.

39:33.439 --> 39:35.173
Hmm... Can I be honest?

39:35.574 --> 39:37.108
Uh, yes.

39:37.142 --> 39:38.410
Your tea tastes
like tree bark.

39:39.811 --> 39:41.112
You eat a lot of tree bark,
do you?

39:41.146 --> 39:42.313
(LAUGHS)

39:42.347 --> 39:44.416
-What, was that too honest?
-A little bit.

39:44.450 --> 39:46.117
-Oh, excuse me.
-Yeah.

39:47.218 --> 39:49.320
Hi, so good to see you.

39:50.055 --> 39:51.289
Glad you made it.

39:57.162 --> 39:59.064
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

40:05.170 --> 40:06.638
You don't have to help.

40:06.672 --> 40:08.607
No, Nick got a ride
home with Brandon

40:08.640 --> 40:10.075
and you can't do
all this by yourself.

40:10.108 --> 40:11.510
I told everyone to leave.

40:11.543 --> 40:13.479
I don't listen so well.

40:13.512 --> 40:15.213
Yeah, I get that about you.

40:15.246 --> 40:17.015
-(CHUCKLES)
-Thanks.

40:19.585 --> 40:22.921
(SIGHS) I just can't believe
what everybody did.

40:24.255 --> 40:25.924
You're very popular
around here.

40:29.961 --> 40:32.831
Hey, we had
the teary hug earlier,

40:32.864 --> 40:34.600
let's have
the celebratory hug.

40:34.633 --> 40:37.235
-Okay. Oh, Sam...
-No more tears.

40:37.268 --> 40:38.670
No more crying.
