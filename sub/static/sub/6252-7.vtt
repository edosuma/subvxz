is a science unto itself.

of these remains

Yes. Perhaps she struck her head
on the mold as someone
held her down in the chocolate.

05:29.914 --> 05:31.620
Which would mean
that she was drowned.

Anthropologically speaking,

often intersect.

08:50.447 --> 08:51.948
Take the ancient Aztecs.

Cocoa pods were used in ritual
to represent the human heart,

08:56.620 --> 08:59.236

represented blood.

I mean, like, tomorrow night,
Founding Fathers.
Oh.

10:57.533 --> 10:59.444
We’ll get food,
some drinks.

10:59.535 --> 11:01.947
I mean, everyone will be
so excited for us.

11:02.079 --> 11:05.742
I can’t wait
to see their faces.
Me neither.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.744
How about
if I invite everybody?

11:07.835 --> 11:10.167
I’m afraid that
you’re gonna give it away.

11:10.254 --> 11:12.370
Yes. Good point.

11:12.506 --> 11:14.747
Yeah.
Sure. Good.

11:15.759 --> 11:17.420
Uh—
[Clears Throat]

11:17.511 --> 11:19.502
Angela’s got something
to ask you.

11:23.058 --> 11:26.391
Hodgins wants to make
a big announcement and tell
everybody that I am pregnant.

11:26.520 --> 11:29.512
But everyone
already knows.
I know.

11:29.606 --> 11:32.939
But Hodgins doesn’t know that,
because he wants it
to be his surprise.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.732
You didn’t say anything,
did you?

11:34.862 --> 11:36.853
No. No one did.
Okay. Good.

11:36.947 --> 11:39.279
Well, everybody’s just
gonna have to act surprised.

11:39.366 --> 11:43.029
And if they can’t pull it off,
then they— they just
have to not come.

11:43.161 --> 11:45.868
They have to
make up an excuse.
Sounds like a plan.

11:45.956 --> 11:48.197
Okay.
Can you do it?

11:48.292 --> 11:50.123
Founding Fathers.
Tomorrow night.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.871
Wait.
Founding Fathers?

11:51.962 --> 11:53.702
I love Founding Fathers!

11:53.797 --> 11:55.253
How was that?
Convincing?

11:56.133 --> 11:58.215
Yes.
That was— That was—

11:58.302 --> 12:00.588
Thank you, Cam.

12:04.433 --> 12:06.674
Oh, my God.
This is Harriet Soloway.

12:06.810 --> 12:09.176
Does she work here?
Yes. In R & D.

12:09.271 --> 12:10.886
Scott!

12:11.815 --> 12:13.225
Did you find out
what happened?

12:13.358 --> 12:16.441
The dead body
is Harriet Soloway.
Harriet?

12:16.528 --> 12:18.143
My God!

12:18.238 --> 12:21.071
- I thought she was at the cocoa
bean symposium in Baltimore.
- So did I.

12:21.158 --> 12:23.615
Right. So when was
the last time you saw her?

12:23.702 --> 12:26.034
Uh, Monday morning
staff meeting.

12:26.121 --> 12:28.703
You said that the chocolate
was poured on Tuesday...

12:28.832 --> 12:30.914
and that it was hard
by Thursday?
That’s right.

12:31.043 --> 12:34.206
I’m gonna need to know all
the people who had access to the
chocolate during that period.

12:34.296 --> 12:36.412
I know my employees,
Agent Booth.

12:36.506 --> 12:39.418
Nobody would ever
just dump her body
in the chocolate bar.

12:39.509 --> 12:40.919
There’s no evidence
to indicate...

12:41.011 --> 12:43.218
the body was placed
in the chocolate
as a means of disposal.

12:43.305 --> 12:45.717
The evidence suggests
she was killed there.

12:45.807 --> 12:49.220
Death by chocolate?
Oh, the press will have
a field day with that.

12:49.311 --> 12:51.176
Do you guys have
any personnel files?

12:51.271 --> 12:53.136
We’re gonna have to
notify next of kin.

12:53.231 --> 12:57.190
I think she has
a sister in Virginia.
Urn, I’ll get you her file.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.359
I’d like to offer a reward.

12:59.446 --> 13:02.313
$50,000 to anyone who
helps us catch the murderer.

13:02.407 --> 13:04.398
That’s very generous of you.

13:04.493 --> 13:06.609
Payable in a lifetime supply
of Walpert chocolate.

13:06.703 --> 13:08.443
Right. I’m guessing the ones
with the gooey center.

13:08.538 --> 13:10.995
Right?
[ Chuckles ]

13:11.083 --> 13:13.290
Your thesis is wrong,
Dr. Hodgins.

13:13.377 --> 13:16.790
We should use
the blow dryers.
It’s a more gentle process.

13:16.880 --> 13:20.498
I’m the lead on this, Vincent,
as well as the king of this lab.

13:20.592 --> 13:22.583
Now, the lights will melt
the chocolate evenly...

13:22.678 --> 13:24.919
and won’t damage
any evidence trapped inside.

13:25.013 --> 13:28.847
Yes, yes, but with the
hair dryers, we can localize
the heat distribution.

13:28.934 --> 13:32.267
Tests supporting this
have been conducted
in Michoacan, Mexico.

13:32.396 --> 13:36.059
I’m gonna turn the lamps on now
to melt the chocolate
and to stop you from talking.

13:37.442 --> 13:40.024
[ Electricity Humming ]
[ Cam ]
Ooh, stop!

13:40.153 --> 13:42.269
[ Device Beeps ]
Turn the lamps off.
Turn the lamps off.

13:42.364 --> 13:43.604
What is going on?

13:43.699 --> 13:46.816
l was going over Angela’s
3-D images of the remains,

13:46.910 --> 13:48.946
and I found something.

13:49.037 --> 13:50.902
Okay.

13:50.998 --> 13:54.081
- See these circles?
- It looks like intestinal gas.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.998
It’s bubbles
in the chocolate.

13:56.086 --> 13:57.792
Two big bubbles trapped right here,

13:57.879 --> 14:00.211
25 and 39 millimeters
above the victim’s mandible.

14:00.298 --> 14:03.586
Are you saying
the chocolate trapped
the victim’s final breath?

14:03.677 --> 14:06.669
- Well, I’m no expert
in viscosity, but—
- I am.

14:06.763 --> 14:09.345
I am. In fact, on—
on Jeopardy/—

14:09.433 --> 14:11.094
Oh, make your point.

14:12.060 --> 14:13.470
In any
endothermic reaction,

14:13.562 --> 14:16.053
the surface molecules are always
the first to become stable.

14:16.189 --> 14:20.683
Therefore, it’s possible
that a gaseous bubble could form
in the warmer liquid...

14:20.777 --> 14:24.395
but become trapped
against the solid surface.

14:24.489 --> 14:27.526
I couldn’t get any useful data
from the soft tissue,
so the bubbles are all I’ve got.

14:27.617 --> 14:30.108
- If they melt away—
- But we have to
melt the chocolate...

14:30.203 --> 14:32.239
in order to get
any information
from the bones.

14:32.330 --> 14:36.243
Yeah, but first we can
cut out these sections
and freeze them...

14:36.334 --> 14:39.292
until we discover a way
to extract the gas
trapped in the bubbles.

14:39.379 --> 14:40.835
Excellent. Do it.

14:40.922 --> 14:44.790
Mr. Nigel-Murray,
if I didn’t have self-control,
I would kiss you.

14:50.474 --> 14:52.681
No interesting facts
off that?

14:52.768 --> 14:55.054
Hmm?
Y-Yeah, yeah.

14:55.145 --> 14:57.978
In fact, the—
the satisfaction...

14:58.065 --> 15:01.228
that human beings take
from fantasizing is—

15:01.318 --> 15:03.434
lt’s directly
related to—

15:03.528 --> 15:06.270
Uh, no, I don’t— Mm-mmm.
There’s no facts on—

15:11.661 --> 15:14.323
Yes, that’s my sister.

15:14.414 --> 15:17.201
I wondered why she
wasn’t calling me back.

15:17.334 --> 15:19.871
When was the last time
you guys spoke?
I don’t know.

15:19.961 --> 15:23.670
A few months ago? We, uh—
We should’ve talked more.
We’re both so busy.

15:23.757 --> 15:26.999
We just let our lives
get away from us.

15:27.094 --> 15:28.630
Are you sure it’s Harriet?

15:28.720 --> 15:31.837
Well, according to
the Jeffersonian, yeah.

15:33.809 --> 15:37.927
Um, are you aware
of any... problems
she may have had?

15:38.021 --> 15:40.182
Any enemies
at the chocolate factory?

15:40.273 --> 15:41.774
No.

15:41.858 --> 15:43.018
Chocolate what?

15:43.110 --> 15:45.021
Are you familiar
with Walpert Chocolate?

15:45.112 --> 15:47.023
Walpert Chocolate?
No.

15:47.114 --> 15:49.776
According to the company,
she’d been working there
for several months...

15:49.866 --> 15:51.777
right after she graduated
from culinary school.

15:51.868 --> 15:53.324
Culinary school?

15:53.411 --> 15:56.278
Harriet went to Penn State.
This is a mistake.

15:56.373 --> 16:00.286
According to her résumé,
she went to
the Arrow Culinary Academy,

16:00.377 --> 16:04.245
followed by an internship
at a prestigious chocolatier
in New York.

16:04.381 --> 16:06.872
Can I see that?
Sure.

16:09.719 --> 16:11.334
These are all lies.

16:11.429 --> 16:13.681
They are all lies.

16:13.765 --> 16:17.804
That is her picture
and that’s her name,
but this resume—

16:17.894 --> 16:19.725
this isn’t her.

16:27.821 --> 16:30.483
- So she lied to get herjob?
- Extensively.

16:30.574 --> 16:33.407
It’s bold,
but it doesn’t necessarily mean
she’s pathological.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.029
Maybe she just
loved chocolate.

16:35.120 --> 16:37.111
You have to eat that?

16:37.205 --> 16:39.196
I’m imagining you chomping down
on her cheek or something.

16:39.291 --> 16:41.247
Can you just— Put it away.

16:41.334 --> 16:45.247
If we don’t face and overcome
unsettling events in life,
we are ruled by them.

16:45.338 --> 16:48.455
I’m not gonna let
some ruthless killer destroy
my enjoyment of chocolate.

16:48.550 --> 16:51.212
It’s not gonna happen.
I love chocolate too much.

16:51.303 --> 16:53.840
- Give me this thing.
- Come on! l was about
to get to the nuts.

16:53.930 --> 16:58.048
Her sister, Geneva,
said that Harriet
didn’t even like chocolate.

16:58.143 --> 17:02.557
She said that she’d lied
about getting this job
and every otherjob.

17:02.647 --> 17:04.899
So I basically
tracked down her actual
employment records...

17:04.983 --> 17:06.894
through her
Social Security number,

17:06.985 --> 17:10.853
and she not only
changed jobs every year,
she hopped industries.

17:10.947 --> 17:14.030
It looks like
she created a new resume
for each position.

17:14.117 --> 17:18.611
Here she says she’s
a world-renowned expert
in the field of couture bustiers.

17:20.624 --> 17:23.161
Lingerie. Like a bra,
only pretty great.

17:23.251 --> 17:24.707
Actually, they’re very sexy.

17:24.794 --> 17:27.206
Sort of s—squeeze the—

17:27.297 --> 17:30.710

all the resumes are filled
with false information?

17:30.800 --> 17:33.837
Cosmetic rep.
Toy company.

17:33.929 --> 17:35.840
Outreach specialist,
whatever that is.

17:35.931 --> 17:38.718
It’s fascinating.
I mean, obviously our victim
is intelligent.

17:38.808 --> 17:42.721
These resumes
are perfectly tailored to
make her an ideal candidate.

17:42.812 --> 17:45.724
Geneva said that Harriet
was probably lying
just for the fun of it.

17:45.815 --> 17:49.433
When someone lies
with this sort of ease in their
professional relationships,

17:49.527 --> 17:52.439
chances are they lie
at least as much in
their personal relationships.

17:52.530 --> 17:54.521
Maybe she just lied
to the wrong person.

17:56.117 --> 17:58.529
I should be able
to use the syringe...

17:58.620 --> 18:01.657
to extract the gas
and any aerated fluid.

18:03.458 --> 18:05.369
Ooh! Bubbles!

18:05.460 --> 18:08.577
Now, the trick
is jabbing them.

18:08.672 --> 18:11.630

this thing on myself...

18:11.716 --> 18:13.547
to check on the baby,

18:14.344 --> 18:15.584
just say hi.

18:15.679 --> 18:17.135
Totally unethical.

Extremely,
but so cool.

be a Fighting Hagfish.

You should let Michelle
make her own decisions, Cam.

18:53.883 --> 18:56.090

“Almost.”
That’s the key word here.

for doing it.

[ Device Beeps ]

19:16.072 --> 19:18.814
I measured the contusion
we found on the skull.

19:18.908 --> 19:22.366
It matches the width of the edge
of the mold that they used
to form the chocolate bar.

19:22.454 --> 19:23.694
Very good work.

19:23.788 --> 19:25.198
That reinforces the theory...

19:25.290 --> 19:28.157
that the victim was held down
with some degree of force.

19:28.251 --> 19:29.616
And suffocated.

19:29.711 --> 19:32.202
The cartilage of the septum
has been crushed,

19:32.297 --> 19:35.414
and there’s another hairline
fracture on the frontal
process of the maxilla.

19:35.508 --> 19:39.126
Pressure fractures
on the margins of the orbits.

19:39.262 --> 19:43.631
Their directionality
definitely suggests Harriet
was suffocated while submerged,

19:43.725 --> 19:48.765
which is in keeping with Cam’s
postulation that the chocolate
captured her last breath.

19:52.025 --> 19:53.515
Oh.

19:59.199 --> 20:01.736
- This is odd.
- The radial trauma?

20:04.412 --> 20:07.279
I originally believed it
to be perimortem, but look.

20:07.374 --> 20:10.411
The remodeling was obscured
by pseudarthrosis.

20:10.502 --> 20:14.962
This injury happened
about five or six months
before she died. See?

20:15.048 --> 20:16.788
Remodeling on each edge.

20:16.883 --> 20:20.125
The limb must not have
been properly immobilized
after injury.

20:20.220 --> 20:22.006
So the bone
didn’t fully calcify,

20:22.097 --> 20:23.883
leaving the appearance
of a fresh wound.

20:23.973 --> 20:27.511
But that wouldn’t have happened
to anyone who had access
to modern medical treatment.

20:27.602 --> 20:30.719
Well, maybe six months ago,
she didn’t have access
to treatment.

20:30.814 --> 20:33.601
Or she chose to deny it
for some reason.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.151

- Done.

21:30.373 --> 21:32.329
Yes.

21:34.669 --> 21:36.170
Great. Thanks.

21:36.254 --> 21:39.291
So, that was the human resources
department at the bra place.

21:39.382 --> 21:41.464
Turns out wherever
Harriet Soloway went,

21:41.551 --> 21:44.088
she had quite the reputation.

21:44.220 --> 21:46.176
What, for lying?
No, for seducing men.

21:46.306 --> 21:48.012
Yowza.
Okay.

21:48.099 --> 21:51.216
You know, that whole “yowza”?
That’s really not necessary.

21:51.311 --> 21:55.805
So you’re implying that Harriet
might’ve been sexually involved
with a Walpert employee?

21:55.899 --> 21:58.311
I looked through
her phone records.
I didn’t see any evidence of it.

21:58.401 --> 22:01.313
But the last place she worked,
Bellomo Sparkling Wines—

22:01.446 --> 22:03.437
[ Exhales ]
What?

22:03.531 --> 22:06.318
I had a very bad experience
drinking Bellomo sparkling wine.

22:06.409 --> 22:07.910
Who hasn’t, right?

22:07.994 --> 22:11.202
Anyways, Harriet had a relationship
with the owner, Lawrence Bellomo,

22:11.289 --> 22:13.154
and apparently
it didn’t end very well.

22:13.291 --> 22:17.330
What happened?
Well, six months ago, she filed
a complaint with her carrier.

22:17.420 --> 22:20.503
She was receiving
harassing phone calls
from a private number.

22:20.632 --> 22:24.216
Turns out they were
coming from Bellomo.
[Cell Phone Ringing]

22:24.302 --> 22:25.712
[Beeps]
Brennan.

22:25.803 --> 22:27.839
We have the results
from the first bubble.

22:27.931 --> 22:30.798
There’s an extremely
high concentration
of carbon dioxide.

22:30.892 --> 22:33.258
So she did exhale
while submerged.

22:33.353 --> 22:38.848
There are also traces
of oxygen, nitrogen,
hydrochloric acid, acetic acid,

22:38.942 --> 22:42.025
oenanfh/c ac/o’, deoano/c ac/o’,
glycerin, glucose,

22:42.153 --> 22:45.441
ethanol—
It was a postmortem
eructation.

22:45.532 --> 22:47.488
Oh, God.
That sounds bad.

22:47.575 --> 22:49.736
- It’s a burp.
- Burp?

22:49.827 --> 22:53.069
- Corpses burp?
- Yeah. Isn’t that awesome?

22:53.164 --> 22:57.248
Well, the combination
of acids and sugar
sounds like ingredients.

22:57.335 --> 22:59.121
lf’s champagne.

22:59.212 --> 23:01.703
So / went to the
liquor store and bought
every brand available.

23:01.798 --> 23:05.837
We ran it through the
GO mass spec to compare
their volatile composition.

23:05.927 --> 23:07.918
Ah-ah-ah.
Bellomo sparkling wine.

23:09.013 --> 23:11.174
- Damn.
- How did you know?

23:11.266 --> 23:12.847
It could just be a coincidence.

23:12.934 --> 23:16.142
It could be, but we should
still ask Lawrence Bellomo
a few questions.

23:19.482 --> 23:21.723
Just because she was
drinking Bellomo...

23:21.818 --> 23:25.276
does not mean
I was drinking Bellomo with her.

23:25.363 --> 23:26.853
Everybody drinks Bellomo.

23:26.948 --> 23:30.236
Everybody
drinks Bellomo once,
Mr. Bellomo.

23:30.326 --> 23:33.659
Phone records show
that you were calling
Harriet repeatedly.

23:33.746 --> 23:37.580
| just wanted to talk to her,
all right?

23:37.667 --> 23:40.579
- l was having a hard time.
- Why? Because she
broke up with you?

23:40.670 --> 23:42.752
That, and my business.

23:42.839 --> 23:45.376
Everything was going wrong
at the same time.

23:45.466 --> 23:47.502
You know what I’m saying?
A perfect storm.

23:47.594 --> 23:51.086
- Yeah? What happened?
- Well, I hired Harriet
about a year ago.

23:51.180 --> 23:55.344
We started seeing each other
and, uh, I thought
we were gonna get married.

23:55.435 --> 23:58.927
Six months later,
out of the blue, she dumps me.

23:59.022 --> 24:02.105
Quits.
Says she needs her space.

24:02.191 --> 24:04.807
- What the hell
does that even mean?
- Nothing.

24:04.902 --> 24:08.611
Space being neutral—
or in some cases negative—
can’t be acquired.

24:08.698 --> 24:11.405
- Therefore—
- Just, uh, go on. Continue.

24:11.492 --> 24:14.108
VVeH,because
having a broken heart’s
not bad enough,

24:14.203 --> 24:17.286
a month later
I lost a contract
with my biggest distributor.

24:17.373 --> 24:19.830
How much do you know
about her personal life
or history?

24:19.917 --> 24:21.999
What she told me.

24:22.086 --> 24:24.793
And her sister.
I know her sister too.

24:24.881 --> 24:26.371
K-Knew her.

24:28.051 --> 24:30.212
You slept
with her sister?
[ Murmurs ]

24:30.303 --> 24:33.966
We had a little fling.
That’s how I met Harriet.

24:34.057 --> 24:37.549
She was staying at Geneva’s
for a couple of days,
and she needed a job.

24:37.644 --> 24:41.228
And... she had
an impressive resume.

24:41.314 --> 24:42.520
You dumped Geneva.

24:42.607 --> 24:45.565
Yeah, well, good thing too.
Geneva was nuts.

24:45.652 --> 24:49.395
When she heard
I was with Harriet,
she went insane.

24:49.489 --> 24:53.823
You know, that woman
waited for me in a tree
outside my house.

24:53.910 --> 24:55.901
She almost took out my eye.

24:56.913 --> 24:59.199
Those girls
hate each other’s guts.

25:04.337 --> 25:07.625
Why didn’t you tell us
about Lawrence Bellomo?

25:07.715 --> 25:11.458
Lawrence... is—
is ancient history.

25:12.637 --> 25:15.049
- Did he kill Harriet?
- I’ll ask the questions.

25:17.266 --> 25:19.177
You were jealous
of your sister,
weren’t you?

25:19.268 --> 25:22.226
What are you getting at, Agent Booth?
Because I don’t think I like it.

25:22.313 --> 25:25.350
Well, Harriet was beautiful,
led more of an exciting life.

25:25.441 --> 25:27.523
You, in comparison,
led a more—

25:27.610 --> 25:30.397
Boring? Are you saying
my life is boring?

25:30.488 --> 25:32.649
So—
So I whacked my sister?

25:32.740 --> 25:35.152
I’m just thinking,
you know, Harriet stole
your boyfriend last year.

25:35.243 --> 25:36.983
She probably
stole your boyfriend
last week.

25:37.078 --> 25:40.036
- So you got upset
and you whacked her.
- Okay.

25:40.123 --> 25:43.206
I got a little crazy
when Lawrence dumped me.

25:43.292 --> 25:47.035
But I just couldn’t believe
he fell for her act.

25:47.130 --> 25:48.245
Her act?

25:48.339 --> 25:50.421
Harriet was a phony.

25:50.508 --> 25:54.547
Ever since we were little,
she would manipulate people
to get whatever she wanted.

25:54.637 --> 25:56.719
No one knew.
Everyone loved her.

25:56.806 --> 26:00.719
So— So, yeah, you’re right.
I was jealous.

26:00.810 --> 26:02.801
But I would never hurt her.

26:04.522 --> 26:07.229
She was stabbed in the arm
six months ago. Do you know
who may have done that?

26:07.316 --> 26:10.524
Her arm? I don’t know.
She probably deserved it.

26:10.611 --> 26:12.226
But it wasn’t me.

26:12.321 --> 26:16.439
I hated her, sure,
but I didn’t kill her.

26:19.412 --> 26:24.873
Interestingly,
the cacao tree is a species
of the genus Theobroma,

26:24.959 --> 26:28.543
which translates from the Latin
as the “food of the gods.”

26:28.629 --> 26:30.540
What would actually
be interesting...

26:30.631 --> 26:34.249
is an explanation of
the perimortem fractures,
Mr. Nigel-Murray.

26:34.343 --> 26:35.674
Of course.

26:35.762 --> 26:38.094
They support our scenario
of the attack.

26:38.181 --> 26:40.388
With one hand, the killer
held the victim down,

26:40.475 --> 26:42.761
fracturing the clavicle
and the sternum,

26:42.852 --> 26:44.843
while suffocating her
with the other hand.

26:44.979 --> 26:47.140
Anything else?
Oh, yes.

26:47.231 --> 26:52.567
I took a closer look
at the antemortem trauma that
somehow escaped medical care.

26:52.653 --> 26:55.736
There is a very small
proliferative lesion...

26:55.823 --> 26:57.984
on the distal edge
of the fracture.

26:58.075 --> 27:00.282
It’s an adventitious cyst.

27:00.369 --> 27:03.111
The compromised bone
formed a callus around
a foreign object...

27:03.206 --> 27:05.697
that was embedded
in the open wound.

27:05.833 --> 27:08.700
Do you have this
on X-ray?
Yes.

27:13.549 --> 27:15.505
Looks like a small rock.
Oh!

27:15.593 --> 27:19.552
Rock was the subject
of my only disputed
Jeopardy! answer.

27:19.639 --> 27:21.595
Is this relevant,
Mr. Nigel-Murray?

27:21.682 --> 27:24.219
The category was
“Famous Jameses.”

27:24.310 --> 27:28.428
The question: “He is
widely considered the best
rock guitarist of all time.”

27:28.523 --> 27:31.765
So, obviously, my answer—
“Who is Jimmy Page?”

27:31.859 --> 27:35.693
No. That’s not the response.
The response they’re looking
for— “Who is Jimi Hendrix?”

27:35.780 --> 27:37.065
Mr. Nigel-Murray—

27:37.156 --> 27:38.612
I know, I know!
Jimi Hendrix!

27:38.699 --> 27:43.033
Okay, first of all,
Jimmy Page is a better musician.
That’s a fact.

27:43.120 --> 27:46.487
Also, Jimi Hendrix—
his original birth name
is Johnny.

27:46.582 --> 27:49.289
So he doesn’t— doesn’t
even belong in the category.

27:49.377 --> 27:52.119
That wasn’t relevant at all,
Mr. Nigel-Murray.

27:52.213 --> 27:57.424
Take a microslice of the cyst
and have Dr. Hodgins
identify the foreign object.

28:00.513 --> 28:02.925
Jimmy Page
is always relevant.

28:04.183 --> 28:07.801
Well, you’re here,
so you must want
my honest opinion.

28:07.895 --> 28:10.011
I guess so.

28:10.106 --> 28:12.313
I think you’re overreacting,
Dr. Saroyan.

28:12.400 --> 28:15.642
Overreacting? Do-Do—
Are shrinks even allowed
to use that word?

28:16.904 --> 28:19.316
Okay, so, why am I
overreacting?

28:19.407 --> 28:23.525
l have a friend, Tim Swift,
who was the golden boy
in my high school.

28:23.619 --> 28:26.076
Got into Harvard,
but dropped out
after the first semester.

28:26.163 --> 28:29.655
Wound up
in some community college
where he majored in weed.

28:29.750 --> 28:34.835
Today, he manages
a $5 billion charitable trust
that saved thousands of lives.

28:34.922 --> 28:37.254
I’m sorry. You lost me
at majoring in weed.

28:38.426 --> 28:40.087
The late teens
and early 20s...

28:40.177 --> 28:42.884
are a time
for experimentation
and growth...

28:42.972 --> 28:45.884
and, you know,
making a few mistakes
is just part of that process.

28:45.975 --> 28:48.261
Oh, you’re
making it worse.

28:48.352 --> 28:51.264
It’s not that I don’t think
that college isn’t a big deal.
Of course it is.

28:51.355 --> 28:54.062
But, come on,
this is Michelle
we’re talking about.

28:54.191 --> 28:56.102
She’s an exceptional
young woman.
She is.

28:56.193 --> 28:59.526
Which is why she deserves to
go to an exceptional school.
This decision—

28:59.614 --> 29:01.445
It’s probably
gonna change anyway.

29:01.532 --> 29:03.238
She and Derrick will have a fight,

29:03.326 --> 29:05.783
or she’ll start to feel left out
when her friends visit schools.

29:05.870 --> 29:07.781
I don’t think
this is a done deal.

29:07.872 --> 29:09.783
Applications are due
in a few months.

29:09.874 --> 29:11.785
What if she realizes
too late?

29:11.876 --> 29:14.788
I’m responsible for her,
Dr. Sweets.

29:15.755 --> 29:17.666
Well, you know,
it may not unfold...

29:17.757 --> 29:19.293
the way you’d like it to,

29:19.383 --> 29:23.717
but Michelle is a smart
and wonderful young woman,
worthy of your trust.

29:23.804 --> 29:25.965
Let this play itself out.

29:27.516 --> 29:29.507
I don’t know
if! can do that.

29:30.353 --> 29:31.763
I do.

29:31.854 --> 29:34.186
You’ve been
a great mother to her.

29:39.695 --> 29:42.687
Remind me again why I should
listen to someone who doesn’t
even take care of a pet.

29:42.782 --> 29:44.773
Right.

29:44.867 --> 29:47.028
l sponsor a water buffalo
in the Philippines.

29:48.579 --> 29:51.867
And I suppose
you wouldn’t get in the way
of her decisions.

29:51.958 --> 29:53.994
Oh, lwouldn’t get
in her way, period.

29:59.548 --> 30:02.540
You made my day, Vincent.
Thank you.

30:02.635 --> 30:07.254
Was it the vivid recounting
of my debauched weekend in Rio?

30:07.348 --> 30:10.761
Or was it that,
uh, juicy little morsel
regarding Signor Trebek?

30:10.851 --> 30:12.387
Both entertaining.

30:12.478 --> 30:15.970
But what really does it for me
is that foreign object
you gave me to ID.

30:16.065 --> 30:17.930
It’s a bug.

30:18.025 --> 30:20.357
He/ope/tis theobromae.

30:20.486 --> 30:23.603
The object we found lodged
inside the bone was an insect?
Most of one.

30:23.698 --> 30:25.609
It’s part of
the Miridae family.

30:25.700 --> 30:27.691
It’s found primarily
in Indonesia.

30:27.785 --> 30:29.491
I’ll go and tell Dr. Brennan.

30:29.578 --> 30:33.116
Well, when you do, make sure
you tell her the best part.

30:33.207 --> 30:36.791
One of the little guy’s
favorite snacks—
cocoa plants.

30:36.877 --> 30:40.836
The evidence shows that
Harriet was in Indonesia
six months ago,

30:40.923 --> 30:43.289
probably on
a cocoa plantation,

30:43.384 --> 30:44.874
which would explain
the insect.

30:44.969 --> 30:47.836
Wait a second.
Here we go.
Indonesia. Cocoa.

30:47.972 --> 30:50.679
Yes?
Aha!
Ambrosia Chocolates.

30:50.808 --> 30:52.844
Remember them?
Yes!
They’re expensive.

30:52.977 --> 30:54.433
Yeah.
And delicious.

30:54.520 --> 30:58.729
I love the cream center,
although not that much anymore.

30:58.816 --> 31:02.308
Every Ambrosia employee
is sent down to Indonesia...

31:02.403 --> 31:06.316
to take part
in this immersion program
to study about cocoa.

31:06.407 --> 31:08.944
But Harriet didn’t work
for Ambrosia Chocolates.

31:09.035 --> 31:10.946
But look at
all the companies, okay,

31:11.037 --> 31:13.153
that she worked for
after she quit.

31:13.247 --> 31:14.703
They all took a hit.

31:14.832 --> 31:17.039
Remember Bellomo Wines?
Yes.

31:17.126 --> 31:20.493
Lawrence Bellomo said that
he lost a major distributor
of his wine.

31:20.588 --> 31:25.332
Every company that Harriet
worked for was a victim
of corporate espionage.

31:25.426 --> 31:27.633
Walpert was developing
a new line of chocolate.

31:27.720 --> 31:29.961
Ambrosia sends Harriet
to Indonesia—

31:30.056 --> 31:32.718
Because Ambrosia
is her real employer.

31:32.808 --> 31:34.594
Harriet...

31:34.685 --> 31:36.221
was a spy.

31:36.312 --> 31:38.143
Yowza.

31:38.230 --> 31:39.345
Yowza.

31:42.193 --> 31:44.184
So, Gail Slevin, is it?

31:45.529 --> 31:48.771
Right. As president
of Ambrosia Chocolates,

31:48.866 --> 31:52.074
you have been trying to
buy out Walpert for years.

31:52.203 --> 31:55.695
Is that right?
We made some overtures.
It’s not really a priority.

31:55.790 --> 32:00.204
Uh, from my count,
six overtures.

32:00.294 --> 32:02.080
Walpert has not bitten.

32:02.171 --> 32:03.911
That must have been
frustrating, right?

32:04.048 --> 32:06.755
Not really.
It’s just business.
“Just business.”

32:06.842 --> 32:08.503
Right.

32:08.594 --> 32:11.461
Are you familiar with
the Economic Espionage Act?

32:11.555 --> 32:13.261
No.
Why would I be?

32:13.349 --> 32:17.342
Well, if I find proof
that you illegally obtained
a competitor’s trade secrets,

32:17.436 --> 32:20.519
you’re lookin’
at least 10 years’ prison.

32:20.606 --> 32:24.019
I agreed to come down here
to discuss the accident
at Walpert’s factory.

32:24.151 --> 32:26.267
Suddenly I need a lawyer.
Well, it wasn’t
an accident.

32:26.362 --> 32:28.102
You see, it was murder,

32:28.197 --> 32:30.529
and we have proof that
the victim worked for you...

32:30.616 --> 32:34.234
and has been since
she entered your immersion
program six months ago.

32:34.328 --> 32:35.989
You see,
Harriet was a spy.

32:36.080 --> 32:38.571
Am I here because you think
I killed her, Agent Booth?

32:38.666 --> 32:41.078
Well, if you didn’t,
you might want to cooperate.

32:41.168 --> 32:44.660
It might make negotiating a plea
on that espionage charge a little easier.

32:49.718 --> 32:52.130
Harriet entered
the immersion program
just like everybody else,

32:52.221 --> 32:54.462
so that she seemed
just like any other employee.

32:54.598 --> 32:57.965
How’d she hurt her arm?
It happened during
the harvesting part of the program.

32:58.060 --> 33:01.223
Go hand machetes
to 16 Ivy League graduates,
see what happens.

33:02.231 --> 33:03.892
She sliced herself.
It got infected.

33:03.983 --> 33:05.894
The plantation’s
in a remote area,

33:05.985 --> 33:08.727
so it was impossible to get
sophisticated medical care.

33:08.821 --> 33:10.982
All in the name
of chocolate.

33:11.073 --> 33:13.314
This is a competitive business,
Agent Booth.

33:13.409 --> 33:15.400
Billions of dollars
are at stake.

33:15.494 --> 33:18.907
Harriet was hired at Walpert
to find the company’s weaknesses.

33:18.998 --> 33:21.580
And maybe steal
some trade secrets
along the way.

33:23.252 --> 33:26.710
She called me last week,
whispering into the phone,
saying she was gonna quit.

33:26.839 --> 33:29.751
Did she say why?
She thought Jimmy Walpert
was onto her.

33:29.842 --> 33:33.084
I told her to be careful.
Jimmy has a temper.

33:39.685 --> 33:40.925
Cam?

33:41.020 --> 33:42.885
Oh. Hey.

33:42.980 --> 33:47.394
I’m just, uh, working on
some disgusting stuff here.

33:47.484 --> 33:50.817
Uh, Derrick flew up
to Maine this week to sign
his letter of intent.

33:50.905 --> 33:53.897
[Laughs]
He brought this back
for me.

33:53.991 --> 33:58.280
He’s actually
a much cuter mascot
than I imagined.

33:58.370 --> 34:00.281
I was hoping you’d take it.

34:00.372 --> 34:03.330
Maybe even wear it
once in a while.

34:03.417 --> 34:07.160
ljust— I still want you
to be proud of me.

34:08.172 --> 34:09.787
Oh, Michelle.

34:09.882 --> 34:12.339
I-I’m extremely proud of you.

34:12.426 --> 34:15.793
And I’m so sorry
I haven’t been supportive.

34:15.888 --> 34:20.632
This is your decision,
and you have my support 100%.

34:22.228 --> 34:24.184
Thank you.

34:26.357 --> 34:27.767
Go, Hagfish!

34:27.858 --> 34:29.849

I’ll see you at home.

34:29.944 --> 34:31.434
Okay.

34:32.988 --> 34:34.649
[Clears Throat]

34:37.201 --> 34:39.943
Dr. Saroyan,
have you a minute?

34:40.037 --> 34:44.656
Interestingly, English Quakers
believed that violence among
the poor would be ameliorated...

34:44.750 --> 34:48.743
if they could be persuaded
to give up alcohol
in favor of chocolate.

34:50.506 --> 34:53.293
I thought you had
something to show me.

34:53.384 --> 34:54.794
Oh, yes, yes.

34:54.885 --> 34:58.218
I found another
perimortem injury.

34:58.305 --> 34:59.886
The fourth finger
on the left hand.

34:59.974 --> 35:02.056
An asymmetry
in the articular condyle...

35:02.142 --> 35:05.054
with damage to
the corresponding facet.

35:05.145 --> 35:07.636
What does that mean—
a dislocated finger?

35:07.731 --> 35:09.437
Twisted and dislocated.

35:09.525 --> 35:11.561
Very near
the time of death, yes.

35:11.652 --> 35:12.892
Huh.

35:12.987 --> 35:14.898
That’s not a typical
defensive wound.

35:14.989 --> 35:19.107
Nor does it seem to factor into
our suffocation scenario.

35:19.201 --> 35:21.692
I’ll make sure
to tell Dr. Brennan.
Very good work.

35:21.787 --> 35:25.029
- Also, very, very—
- Last one, Mr. Nigel-Murray.
Make it good.

35:25.124 --> 35:26.534
Right.

who had great success...

35:29.253 --> 35:31.164

amongst the masses,

35:31.255 --> 35:34.042

drumroll, please.

35:35.926 --> 35:38.133

I’ll do it myself.
[ lmitates Drumroll]

35:40.973 --> 35:44.431
That’s actually
sort of interesting.

35:46.603 --> 35:48.184
[Whispers ]
Thank you.

35:48.272 --> 35:50.638
Gail Slevin
admitted Harriet was a spy.

35:50.733 --> 35:52.439
And she was scared.
Of what?

35:52.568 --> 35:54.274

35:56.363 --> 35:59.526

And what about
the other chocolate blogs?

35:59.616 --> 36:01.527
- Mr. Walpert?
- Not now!

36:01.618 --> 36:03.154
Excuse me?

36:03.245 --> 36:07.409

are costing me big-time!

talking about?
I don’t know.

36:13.380 --> 36:15.621
Are you threatening
a federal officer?
Oh, back off!

36:15.758 --> 36:17.669
I mean it.
Okay,
you’re under arrest.

36:17.760 --> 36:21.673
You have the right
to remain silent,
and if I were you I would, pal.

36:22.723 --> 36:25.055
Believe this guy?

36:27.770 --> 36:29.476
You knew what
Harriet was doing,

36:29.563 --> 36:32.020
so you drowned her
and left her for dead.

36:32.107 --> 36:35.019
- Suffocated her.
His hand was over her mouth.
- Right. I got it, Bones.

36:35.110 --> 36:38.318
So when did you, uh,
discover that Harriet
was working for Gail Slevin?

36:39.281 --> 36:41.442
What?
That little bitch!

36:41.533 --> 36:43.649
- What did she tell them?
- Calm down!

36:43.744 --> 36:46.861
Don’t tell me to calm down!
This business is my life!
Get Scott in here.

36:46.955 --> 36:50.038
If he showed her anything,
if he showed her
one damn slip of paper—

36:50.125 --> 36:52.912
- What does Scott
have to do with this?
- He’s the chocolatier.

36:53.003 --> 36:55.995
I handle the business,
but he oversees
all of the new formulations.

36:56.090 --> 36:59.582
l’m— I’m just a face,
like the Colonel.

36:59.676 --> 37:02.918
But my suit is way nicer—
no string tie or anything.

37:03.013 --> 37:06.676
- Listen, did Harriet spend
a lot of time with Mr. Kimper?
- You think I give a crap?

37:06.767 --> 37:08.177
I hope so.

37:08.268 --> 37:10.850
Scott’s wife was... a horse.

37:10.938 --> 37:12.929
You could actually
put a saddle on her.

37:13.023 --> 37:16.481
And Harriet was,
uh, quite a tease.

37:17.945 --> 37:21.153
Well, Scott doesn’t hold back
on the credit card charges.

37:21.240 --> 37:23.276
Take a look at that charge.

“MinuteDivorce.com.”

37:25.077 --> 37:27.193
Filed online last Sunday.

37:27.287 --> 37:30.450
The same day that he spent 12.99
at the liquor store—

37:30.541 --> 37:32.577
Bellomo sparkling wine,
I imagine.

37:32.668 --> 37:34.533
And $2,000
for an engagement ring.

37:34.628 --> 37:37.165
Which he yanked off her finger,
dislocating it.

37:37.256 --> 37:39.838
I’m telling you,
all the evidence points
back to Scott Kimper.

37:39.925 --> 37:42.382
Unfortunately,
it’s just circumstantial.

of the remaining air bubble.
It’s good news.

37:58.777 --> 38:01.519

Is this Michelle’s essay
to Johns Hopkins?

38:04.116 --> 38:07.028
Yes.
It’s very good.

38:07.119 --> 38:08.484
It is.

applying to any other

That’s just wrong.

that is being a mother.

I can trust your discretion.

from the second bubble we found
trapped in the chocolate.

38:47.367 --> 38:48.903
You mean the eructation.

38:48.994 --> 38:52.737
This one wasn’t a burp.
It was her final exhalation.

38:52.831 --> 38:58.292
It contained oxygen,
nitrogen, carbon dioxide
and a trace amount of blood.

38:58.378 --> 39:00.118
Harriet’s blood?

39:00.214 --> 39:02.500
Not Harriet’s blood.
Someone else’s.

39:02.591 --> 39:04.957
If it was her final exhalation,

39:05.052 --> 39:08.465
then the blood must belong
to the person who was
with her when she died.

Yes.

I trusted her.

for Ambrosia Chocolate.

with her.

that would have been the best
chocolate bar you ever had.

because he loved her?

39:50.472 --> 39:53.339

with a fake. He found out,
he couldn’t handle it.

can’t pretend not knowing,
then you shouldn’t go,
