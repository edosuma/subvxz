00:05.255 --> 00:09.498
(music playing)

01:09.569 --> 01:12.652
(sighs)

01:32.050 --> 01:36.840
(birds chirping)

04:23.388 --> 04:25.629
(birds chirping)

04:50.665 --> 04:53.031
(gate opens)

05:19.110 --> 05:20.896
Sasha: Hi.

05:24.699 --> 05:25.905
Are you here--?

05:26.075 --> 05:28.908
I'm here
because I need your help.

05:37.253 --> 05:40.165
(music playing)

06:17.877 --> 06:20.289
Sorry for taking over your trailer.

06:20.463 --> 06:21.578
Oh.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.792
I grew up
with a lot of people around.

06:23.966 --> 06:25.172
I'm used to it.

06:25.343 --> 06:27.004
Big family?

06:27.178 --> 06:30.090
Uh, group home.

06:31.182 --> 06:33.423
This isn't like that,
though.

06:33.601 --> 06:35.762
Not the bad parts,
at least.

06:35.937 --> 06:39.020
For the first time,
I feel like I belong.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.982
Trying to make sure you
and Sasha became a part of this

06:43.152 --> 06:45.529
made me
a part of this.

06:45.696 --> 06:47.823
When I was first here...

06:47.990 --> 06:49.571
l was never here.

06:49.742 --> 06:52.074
l, um--

06:52.245 --> 06:55.203
I always found it hard
getting close to anyone--

06:55.373 --> 06:58.080
neighbors, friends...

06:58.251 --> 06:59.957
boyfriends.

07:05.842 --> 07:07.628
You should
try it sometime.

07:07.802 --> 07:10.339
Even if
it doesn't last.

07:13.015 --> 07:16.758
I'm gonna talk to our blacksmith
about making more spears.

07:16.936 --> 07:20.599
Maybe we can trade with
the Kingdom for some body armor.

07:20.773 --> 07:23.731
Thing is, what we really need
is riot gear.

07:29.449 --> 07:32.282
(indistinct conversations)

07:51.345 --> 07:54.212
(sighs)

07:56.434 --> 07:58.140
(door opens)

08:03.649 --> 08:04.900
l was...

08:05.067 --> 08:08.855
looking for something to read
the other day.

08:14.577 --> 08:16.317
You can have
the bullets.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.407
ldidn't know
you had a gun.

08:18.581 --> 08:19.946
I didn't.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.867
I do now.

08:24.045 --> 08:27.037
Sasha, don't go,
not yet.

08:27.215 --> 08:28.796
(sighs)

08:30.760 --> 08:33.593
Rosita didn't come here
to train people.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.173
You're both
going after Negan.

08:37.099 --> 08:38.714
But you can't do that
without people.

08:38.893 --> 08:40.508
A lot of people.

08:40.686 --> 08:42.938
We've talked about this.

08:43.105 --> 08:45.938
I know
what you think.

08:46.108 --> 08:48.269
And I appreciate that.

08:48.444 --> 08:51.436
But I'm not
gonna change my mind.

08:51.614 --> 08:54.071
She's not.

08:54.242 --> 08:57.860
Does Maggie know
Rosita's here yet?

08:58.037 --> 09:00.870
Uh, l-l-l don't think so.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.655
I didn't...

09:03.751 --> 09:05.287
You should tell her.

09:05.461 --> 09:06.621
About all of it.

09:06.796 --> 09:10.254
No.
Not yet.

09:10.424 --> 09:13.632
Sh-- I'm still--
I'm still getting ready.

09:15.263 --> 09:17.470
And the thing is,
Rosita is going,

09:17.640 --> 09:19.176
with or without me.

09:19.350 --> 09:20.635
So it should be
with me.

09:20.810 --> 09:22.095
- Then I'll go, too.
- Me, too.

09:22.270 --> 09:23.635
No.

09:23.813 --> 09:27.271
The Hilltop has to be ready
for what happens after.

09:27.441 --> 09:29.056
Maggie needs you.

09:30.278 --> 09:32.314
She needs you, too.

09:32.488 --> 09:34.604
Not anymore.

09:36.117 --> 09:38.779
She has everyone else,

09:38.953 --> 09:41.365
and they have her.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.036
You can stay.

09:52.008 --> 09:55.842
But I know you won't
and she won't,

09:56.012 --> 09:58.469
but I wish you would.

09:58.639 --> 10:02.097
'Cause it's a long life,
and then it isn't.

10:02.268 --> 10:05.260
You can take
anything else you need.

10:05.438 --> 10:08.851
But you and Rosita
need to talk to Maggie.

10:09.025 --> 10:10.890
You owe her that much.

10:22.913 --> 10:25.404
(door closes)

10:25.583 --> 10:27.494
Listen...

10:27.668 --> 10:29.374
Enid...

10:31.047 --> 10:32.787
Maggie trusts you.

10:34.884 --> 10:39.298
You have to protect her,
no matter what.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.258
She's the future
of this place.

10:41.432 --> 10:43.047
I know it.

10:45.853 --> 10:47.639
So are you.

10:53.861 --> 10:56.568
Hold on to this
for me.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.023
It's for the baby.

11:02.870 --> 11:06.237
Maybe you can work on it
while I'm gone.

11:08.292 --> 11:09.702
Okay.

11:12.296 --> 11:14.252
Sasha".

11:14.423 --> 11:16.004
Yeah.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.303
In 10 minutes,

11:22.473 --> 11:24.213
I'm gonna tell Maggie
what's going on.

11:26.102 --> 11:28.013
It's up to you
what you want to do with that.

11:30.898 --> 11:34.811
I'm doing
what you asked.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.648
(door closes)

11:50.918 --> 11:53.785
(clanging)

11:53.963 --> 11:55.453
The Saviors are coming!

11:55.631 --> 11:57.462
- (clanging continues)
- The Saviors are coming!

11:57.633 --> 11:58.918
- We have to get Maggie.
- Where is she?

11:59.093 --> 12:01.084
Come on!

12:07.476 --> 12:08.511
Where do we hide?

12:08.686 --> 12:10.051
We're not hiding.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.315
All right, get in.

12:17.486 --> 12:19.192
It goes
to the other side.

12:19.363 --> 12:21.775
We got to get out
before Maggie does.

12:21.949 --> 12:24.110
(grunts)

12:27.371 --> 12:31.034
(vehicles approaching)

12:33.627 --> 12:36.004
We'll never make it
in time.

12:36.172 --> 12:40.836
Come on!

12:44.930 --> 12:46.136
Just stay down there.

12:46.307 --> 12:47.763
I'll keep them away.

12:47.933 --> 12:50.675
They aren't the same ones
who came to Alexandria.

13:21.967 --> 13:24.458
Gregory:
Simon! Hello.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.253
Right back at you,
Gregory.

13:27.431 --> 13:28.637
Hello.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.264
Ahh.

13:30.434 --> 13:31.765
(both laugh)

13:31.936 --> 13:34.473
We weren't, uh,
expecting you back so soon.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.854
You want to talk
in my office?

13:37.024 --> 13:39.481
I got a bottle of gin
my people found.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.358
You're a gin man,
right?

13:41.529 --> 13:43.861
Oh, I'm a man of...

13:44.031 --> 13:47.023
shifting specifics of tastes
in transition.

13:47.201 --> 13:48.782
I'm into tequila now.

13:49.870 --> 13:52.452
Aﬁejo.
Reposado.

13:52.623 --> 13:54.079
Sipping, mixing...

13:54.250 --> 13:56.081
Un mundo de sabor.

13:56.252 --> 13:57.458
(chuckles)

13:57.628 --> 13:59.539
Gin seems like turpentine.

13:59.713 --> 14:01.044
(chuckles)

14:01.215 --> 14:04.753
It happened quick with a gimlet
the other night.

14:04.927 --> 14:07.213
I'm an unusual
kind of creature.

14:07.388 --> 14:08.798
You know what?

14:08.973 --> 14:10.463
I respect that.

14:10.641 --> 14:12.347
Yeah.
TequHa.

14:12.518 --> 14:14.930
Mental note.
Locked.

14:15.104 --> 14:16.469
Great.

14:16.647 --> 14:18.057
Oh, no need to talk.

14:18.232 --> 14:20.644
This is hopefully
a quick visit.

14:20.818 --> 14:22.103
Oh.

14:22.278 --> 14:24.269
Well,
what can I do for you?

14:24.446 --> 14:26.482
That's an
excellent question.

14:26.657 --> 14:29.114
Alas, the answer's
not so excellent.

14:29.285 --> 14:31.901
You have a certain somebody
that, uh...

14:32.079 --> 14:34.115
now needs to be
Negan's certain somebody,

14:34.290 --> 14:38.203
so what you can do for me
is point me in their direction.

14:40.337 --> 14:42.749
So, who is it?

14:42.923 --> 14:44.584
You get
your pointy finger up,

14:44.758 --> 14:45.838
and I'll tells ya.

14:46.010 --> 14:47.170
(chuckles)

14:53.767 --> 14:55.268
Daryl.

14:55.436 --> 14:57.973
(door creaks)

14:58.147 --> 15:00.183
Daryl.

15:00.357 --> 15:02.018
Daryl.

15:16.624 --> 15:18.160
Did you dig that tunnel?

15:18.334 --> 15:20.165
Maggie thought
we needed a quick way out.

15:20.336 --> 15:21.496
So I made one.

15:21.670 --> 15:24.252
Well, we're out.
So now what?

15:25.716 --> 15:27.297
You know.

15:49.073 --> 15:51.359
If this one starts,
l'll siphon some gas.

15:51.533 --> 15:52.659
| just got to find--

15:52.826 --> 15:54.441
There's an
empty water bottle.

15:57.581 --> 16:00.573
I thought
this was the one, but...

16:09.593 --> 16:11.094
Like it?

16:11.261 --> 16:13.001
I made it.

16:13.180 --> 16:15.762
Car's dead.

16:39.123 --> 16:42.456
(bird squawking in distance)

16:59.810 --> 17:00.970
(car door creaks)

17:01.145 --> 17:03.636
Where'd you learn
to disarm bombs?

17:03.814 --> 17:05.395
(car door creaks)

17:05.566 --> 17:07.477
Were you in the Army?

17:07.651 --> 17:10.233
(sighs)
Someone I knew.

17:11.447 --> 17:12.937
Not him.

17:14.283 --> 17:15.614
Listen, I'm not here to play
"Get to Know You,"

17:15.784 --> 17:17.649
so either we talk about
the mission or we don't.

17:23.834 --> 17:26.917
Okay.

17:33.802 --> 17:35.713
Jesus said
there's some buildings,

17:35.888 --> 17:36.968
two, three,
four stories,

17:37.139 --> 17:39.471
just outside the sanctuary
to the east of it.

17:39.641 --> 17:42.178
At least one of them should have
a line of sight to the rear courtyard,

17:42.352 --> 17:44.638
past the fence
with the walkers on it.

17:44.813 --> 17:47.304
We hole up, we wait,
we take a shot from there.

17:48.817 --> 17:50.318
If we have to
get closer,

17:50.486 --> 17:52.226
there's some weak spots
in the perimeter

17:52.404 --> 17:53.814
we might still be able
to take advantage of,

17:53.989 --> 17:56.025
but if we can,

17:56.200 --> 17:59.784
I say we stay outside,
do it clean.

17:59.953 --> 18:01.909
Maybe make it
out of there alive.

18:12.800 --> 18:13.880
You see a problem
with that?

18:14.051 --> 18:16.337
I want to make sure we get him.
That means we go in.

18:16.512 --> 18:17.877
If we shoot from a distance
and miss,

18:18.055 --> 18:19.340
- we don't get another chance.
- I won't miss.

18:19.515 --> 18:21.551
Even if you shoot and graze him,
he doesn't die.

18:21.725 --> 18:22.931
I won't miss.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.717
If we go in
and get caught--

18:24.895 --> 18:25.975
I won't get caught.

18:26.146 --> 18:27.727
What the hell's
wrong with you?

18:29.108 --> 18:31.815
They take us,
we don't get another try.

18:31.985 --> 18:33.725
Because they'll kill us.

18:34.905 --> 18:36.736
If we're out here,
we're alive.

18:36.907 --> 18:38.568
We get another go.

18:38.742 --> 18:40.528
(walkers growling)

18:54.758 --> 18:57.044
Nothing is wrong with me,
Sasha.

18:57.219 --> 18:59.756
I'm gonna make sure
he's dead.

18:59.930 --> 19:01.420
Look, if this
is too much for you,

19:01.598 --> 19:03.554
you want to bail,
now's your chance.

19:03.725 --> 19:04.714
I'm not
going anywhere.

19:04.893 --> 19:05.882
Well, I'm done
talking about it.

19:06.061 --> 19:08.017
Good.
Maybe you'll think about it.

19:09.565 --> 19:10.554
Maybe you'll
change your mind

19:10.732 --> 19:13.064
about what it takes
to get what you want.

19:22.244 --> 19:23.950
Hi!

19:24.121 --> 19:26.612
Uh, I've got
fresh veggies--

19:26.790 --> 19:29.623
Stop.
They're vegetables.

19:29.793 --> 19:32.409
Use the whole word.
We have time.

19:32.588 --> 19:33.919
Uh...

19:34.089 --> 19:35.590
Okay.

19:35.757 --> 19:39.295
l have these vegetables
they told me to bring over,

19:39.469 --> 19:42.632
uh, and the basket's
pretty heavy.

19:42.806 --> 19:44.467
(chuckles)
For me, I mean.

19:44.641 --> 19:46.347
Probably not you.
Uh, here.

19:46.518 --> 19:47.928
Load them in the truck,

19:48.103 --> 19:50.139
and, uh, if you meet me
by the garden,

19:50.314 --> 19:52.771
- I can get you the rest--
- Stop.

19:52.941 --> 19:56.525
ldon't know who you think I am
or who we are.

19:56.695 --> 19:59.152
Load them yourself.
I'm busy.

19:59.323 --> 20:01.609
Oh. Sorry.
I'm sorry.

20:01.783 --> 20:06.026
Girl, pick that shit up
right now and scram.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.161
And I'll take that.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.876
Now.

20:15.047 --> 20:18.130
Don't make me
cut it off you, girl.

20:31.563 --> 20:34.179
(door creaks)

20:34.358 --> 20:37.771
(footsteps)

20:39.821 --> 20:42.858
(door creaks)

20:50.707 --> 20:52.743
(sniffs)

21:26.827 --> 21:29.614
Dr. Harlan Carson,
correct?

21:29.788 --> 21:31.528
Do you need a checkup?

21:31.707 --> 21:32.947
Simon: Probably.

21:33.125 --> 21:36.458
It's been a few years,
but I'm not here for that.

21:36.628 --> 21:38.209
(door closes)

21:38.380 --> 21:40.245
We already gave you as much
medicine as we could spare

21:40.424 --> 21:42.790
- the last time you were here.
- Yes, you did.

21:42.968 --> 21:45.584
But we're not here
to take more of that.

21:45.762 --> 21:47.718
Congratulations!

21:47.889 --> 21:49.220
You're moving up
in the world.

21:49.391 --> 21:51.222
Negan wants you
where he is.

21:51.393 --> 21:53.554
You're an important fellow,
Haﬂan.

21:55.230 --> 21:57.221
You're coming with us.

21:58.650 --> 22:02.734
Look, l-- l have patients here
that need me.

22:02.904 --> 22:05.111
Why does Negan
need two doctors?

22:13.081 --> 22:16.573
Well, I think my look may have
conveyed the information.

22:16.752 --> 22:19.084
People say l have
an expressive face.

22:19.254 --> 22:21.745
But if not,
let me repeat your question.

22:21.923 --> 22:23.299
Why do we need
two doctors?

22:23.467 --> 22:26.049
Answer-- we don't.

22:31.266 --> 22:33.928
So...

22:34.102 --> 22:35.433
my brother
pissed someone off,

22:35.604 --> 22:37.140
get himself killed?

22:37.314 --> 22:38.975
Something like that.

22:39.149 --> 22:41.936
Very, very ugly stuff.

22:42.110 --> 22:44.692
My condolences.

22:44.863 --> 22:47.400
But it's time.

22:48.950 --> 22:50.861
All of my charts
are in order.

22:51.036 --> 22:52.196
You need
to make arrangements

22:52.371 --> 22:53.781
for some kind
of medical care here,

22:53.955 --> 22:56.332
especially
for my ongoing patients.

22:56.500 --> 22:58.286
|wi||.

22:59.878 --> 23:01.459
- I need to pack.
- Simon: You don't.

23:01.630 --> 23:02.961
We have
everything you need,

23:03.131 --> 23:04.962
and what we don't,
we'll get.

23:05.133 --> 23:06.964
Hey,
you like ice cream?

23:07.135 --> 23:08.716
We have ice cream.

23:08.887 --> 23:12.550
We have a lady
that makes cardamom gelato.

23:12.724 --> 23:13.964
Shit you not.

23:14.142 --> 23:15.552
Oh! I almost forgot.

23:15.727 --> 23:17.718
Set that down.

23:17.896 --> 23:19.227
(box thuds)

23:19.398 --> 23:21.889
Well, fair is fair.

23:22.067 --> 23:23.898
We're not leaving you
high and dry

23:24.069 --> 23:25.980
when it comes
to medical solutions.

23:26.154 --> 23:27.360
Go on.

23:27.531 --> 23:30.318
(sighs)

23:39.668 --> 23:41.579
(box closes)

23:44.339 --> 23:47.001
Simon, a word?

23:47.175 --> 23:48.756
Mm.

23:51.346 --> 23:54.588
Look, I think
I've proven

23:54.766 --> 23:56.927
that I can work
with Negan.

23:57.102 --> 23:59.309
I'm a can-do guy,

23:59.479 --> 24:02.016
but I got to hang on
to my people's trust.

24:02.190 --> 24:04.897
Otherwise, you don't know
who might take over.

24:05.068 --> 24:08.026
You know, someone else
might not be so cooperative.

24:08.196 --> 24:11.188
They might have
crazy ideas.

24:13.368 --> 24:15.609
Who might take over?

24:15.787 --> 24:17.402
What crazy ideas?

24:17.581 --> 24:18.787
I don't know.

24:18.957 --> 24:21.118
I'm just considering
worst-case scenarios.

24:21.293 --> 24:22.874
You know,
what I'm saying is,

24:23.044 --> 24:27.378
I know human nature,
and it isn't inconceivable.

24:28.925 --> 24:31.632
- I hear your concern.
- Mm.

24:31.803 --> 24:34.215
I'm not
insensitive to it.

24:34.389 --> 24:36.971
- Mm.
- Right?

24:38.810 --> 24:42.098
If you're having problems
of that nature...

24:43.440 --> 24:45.726
come to see me.

24:45.901 --> 24:47.232
Anytime.

24:47.402 --> 24:49.313
I don't know
where to go.

24:49.488 --> 24:51.103
(chuckles)

24:51.281 --> 24:55.399
I'll arrange it
so that...

24:58.079 --> 25:00.661
you just tell the guard
who you are...

25:00.832 --> 25:02.072
Mm-hmm.

25:02.250 --> 25:04.411
...and he'll
let you right in.

25:07.839 --> 25:10.956
Long as
there's no shenanigans afoot.

25:12.093 --> 25:13.754
There will be none.

25:13.929 --> 25:15.385
(chuckles)

25:17.349 --> 25:18.680
I just-- I just
would like you to consider--

25:18.850 --> 25:20.431
Wonderful.

25:22.646 --> 25:24.011
Hmm?

25:25.732 --> 25:28.098
We'll crack open
some tequila.

25:28.276 --> 25:31.063
We'll talk.

25:31.238 --> 25:32.478
We'll work it out.

25:33.615 --> 25:34.775
You're a good producer for us.

25:34.950 --> 25:36.281
I don't want you
to be so stressed.

25:36.451 --> 25:38.112
Yeah.

25:38.286 --> 25:40.698
I'd be a lot less stressed
if you'd leave my doctor.

25:40.872 --> 25:42.453
Gregory...

25:42.624 --> 25:44.990
Got it.
Okay.

25:45.168 --> 25:47.079
I won't ask again.

26:04.813 --> 26:07.600
(footsteps)

26:19.327 --> 26:21.579
(box thuds)

26:36.845 --> 26:39.803
(door creaks)

26:39.973 --> 26:42.931
(footsteps depart)

26:43.101 --> 26:45.717
He's gone.

26:47.522 --> 26:50.855
(sighs)
You were gonna kill that guy.

26:51.026 --> 26:52.766
He was gonna find us.

26:52.944 --> 26:55.936
He wasn't,
and he didn't.

26:58.533 --> 27:00.524
He deserved to die.

27:02.662 --> 27:04.163
Ever since
you got here,

27:04.331 --> 27:06.743
you haven't said a word
to me.

27:08.752 --> 27:10.663
Would you look at me?

27:10.837 --> 27:12.919
Please?

27:15.717 --> 27:17.503
(sniffles)

27:19.721 --> 27:22.679
Daryl...

27:24.267 --> 27:27.350
(voice breaking)
I'm sorry.

27:29.564 --> 27:32.101
I'm sorry.

27:36.071 --> 27:37.561
(sniffles)

27:40.575 --> 27:42.406
It wasn't your fault.

27:43.745 --> 27:47.237
(sniffles)
It was.

27:47.415 --> 27:48.746
No.

27:48.917 --> 27:50.953
It wasn't.

27:51.127 --> 27:54.961
You're one of the good things
in this world.

27:55.131 --> 27:57.622
That's what
Glenn thought.

27:57.801 --> 27:59.416
And he would know,

27:59.594 --> 28:02.586
'cause he was
one of the good things, too.

28:02.764 --> 28:04.345
(shuddered breathing)

28:05.892 --> 28:09.384
And, uh...

28:09.562 --> 28:12.599
I wanted
to kill that guy, too.

28:13.942 --> 28:17.184
I wanted to string them all up
and watch them die.

28:21.324 --> 28:24.361
But we have to win.

28:32.794 --> 28:34.955
Help me win.

29:14.794 --> 29:19.754
(truck engines start)

29:39.694 --> 29:44.484
(walkers growling)

29:46.534 --> 29:48.445
This'll work.

30:02.842 --> 30:05.675
(growling continues)

30:29.410 --> 30:32.493
Now.

30:38.795 --> 30:43.539
(growling continues)

30:53.309 --> 30:57.052
(grunts)

30:58.773 --> 31:00.104
(electricity crackles)

31:00.275 --> 31:02.311
- (engine starts)
- Get in!

31:02.485 --> 31:04.476
(growling continues)

31:14.455 --> 31:16.707
(engine revs)

31:25.758 --> 31:31.094
(tires screech)

31:31.264 --> 31:33.846
(walkers growling)

31:43.318 --> 31:46.651
(walkers growling)

32:19.687 --> 32:21.598
(sighs)
Anything?

32:23.316 --> 32:24.897
Negan still hasn't
come out.

32:25.068 --> 32:26.979
But Eugene's out there.

32:28.196 --> 32:29.481
Eugene?

32:29.656 --> 32:30.862
It looks like...

32:31.032 --> 32:33.489
he's ordering
people around.

32:35.078 --> 32:37.490
Playing some angle.

32:41.250 --> 32:43.457
Will you
teach me those knots?

32:43.628 --> 32:46.040
I know a bunch,
but not those.

32:47.256 --> 32:49.042
Won't matter soon.

32:51.511 --> 32:53.502
It might.

33:01.771 --> 33:03.102
(sighs)

33:03.272 --> 33:05.684
Yeah,
I'll show you.

33:05.858 --> 33:09.271
All right,
here's the first one.

33:09.445 --> 33:12.232
- Cross it over your hand like that.
- Mm.

33:12.407 --> 33:16.400
Then you take the top loop,
bring it down, up,

33:16.577 --> 33:19.705
and back through, then...

33:20.915 --> 33:22.246
Got it?

33:22.417 --> 33:26.330
Let me try.

33:30.091 --> 33:32.332
(chuckles)

33:35.596 --> 33:38.929
(walkers growling in distance)

33:43.604 --> 33:46.937
(insects chirping)

33:49.318 --> 33:51.149
Sasha: You know...

33:51.320 --> 33:54.562
we got lucky,
having you with us.

33:55.825 --> 33:57.907
You know
how to do everything.

34:12.258 --> 34:13.873
(sighs)

34:15.970 --> 34:18.256
Johnny.

34:18.431 --> 34:21.093
That's who taught me
about bombs.

34:21.267 --> 34:22.973
Survivalist,
prepper-type shit.

34:23.144 --> 34:24.429
(both chuckle)

34:24.604 --> 34:26.811
Marcus taught me
about cars.

34:26.981 --> 34:28.812
He was a mechanic...

34:28.983 --> 34:30.814
and a wannabe
stunt driver.

34:31.986 --> 34:33.772
And an asshole.

34:35.281 --> 34:37.192
Knot-tying
was from Chaser.

34:38.367 --> 34:40.653
Yeah, that wasn't
his real name.

34:40.828 --> 34:41.988
(both laugh)

34:42.163 --> 34:44.028
There were others.

34:46.834 --> 34:48.449
Were those people you lost
on the way to D.C.?

34:48.628 --> 34:50.038
No, not them.

34:50.213 --> 34:53.046
A lot of guys
wanted to protect me,

34:53.216 --> 34:54.831
like there was no way

34:55.009 --> 34:57.045
I could know
how to take care of myself.

34:58.346 --> 34:59.586
And I didn't.

35:01.015 --> 35:03.222
And I hated
the way that felt.

35:05.019 --> 35:07.886
So I rolled with it.

35:08.064 --> 35:09.474
They didn't even notice
I was picking up

35:09.649 --> 35:12.015
everything they knew how to do
and doing it better.

35:15.863 --> 35:18.650
Then I'd outgrow them
and bounce.

35:23.204 --> 35:25.069
The sex
was just for fun.

35:25.248 --> 35:27.239
(both laugh)

35:27.416 --> 35:29.372
When the world's over,

35:29.544 --> 35:31.034
everyone should be
getting their rocks off.

35:38.177 --> 35:40.554
Was that
how it was with him?

35:42.098 --> 35:44.430
Abraham?

35:48.688 --> 35:50.599
No.

35:53.442 --> 35:54.693
I fell in with him

35:54.861 --> 35:57.523
because he saw
I could handle my shit.

35:57.697 --> 35:59.608
And I never
looked back.

36:06.455 --> 36:09.197
Well, no, I did.

36:10.751 --> 36:12.207
When it was over.

36:14.422 --> 36:16.663
Yeah.

36:23.723 --> 36:26.806
You know the thing
that killed me?

36:26.976 --> 36:28.932
When we got
to Alexandria,

36:29.103 --> 36:30.889
l was acting like
I was all good 'cause he wasn't.

36:31.063 --> 36:32.223
(chuckles)

36:34.275 --> 36:36.106
Then, the son of a bitch
was actually all good.

36:36.277 --> 36:37.437
(chuckles)

36:39.280 --> 36:41.566
And I couldn't
figure this one out.

36:42.992 --> 36:44.607
Living there,
feeling like we had made it,

36:44.785 --> 36:45.991
I couldn't pick that up.

36:47.371 --> 36:49.111
Then,
when he bounced, I...

36:54.128 --> 36:57.040
I thought I hated you.

36:59.091 --> 37:00.592
But maybe ljust hated

37:00.760 --> 37:03.046
that he figured out
his shit first.

37:07.308 --> 37:08.923
(scoffs)

37:10.978 --> 37:13.390
I've never told anyone
any of that stuff.

37:14.982 --> 37:16.722
Who I was, what I did...

37:18.778 --> 37:21.144
I'm glad...

37:21.322 --> 37:23.654
that you felt like...

37:24.992 --> 37:26.698
you could.

37:33.167 --> 37:35.499
I was stupid
to waste so much time.

37:45.513 --> 37:46.844
Now I'll never
get to tell Abraham

37:47.014 --> 37:48.925
I'm happy he was happy.

37:59.318 --> 38:01.730
Were you happy?

38:08.202 --> 38:10.284
I was.

38:11.706 --> 38:13.913
(sniffles)

38:14.083 --> 38:15.948
(sighs)

38:18.379 --> 38:20.335
It wasn't his time.

38:22.216 --> 38:25.049
Abraham would've wanted
to go out fighting.

38:29.390 --> 38:32.974
And that asshole with the bat
took that away, too.

38:36.063 --> 38:39.897
To go out
with a point to going out.

38:49.410 --> 38:52.117
Iguess
we all want that.

38:58.294 --> 39:00.910
No matter
how it all goes down,

39:01.088 --> 39:02.828
I got your back.

39:04.091 --> 39:06.127
And I've got yours.

39:11.891 --> 39:13.722
You think
that prick's out there yet?

39:13.893 --> 39:15.053
Hmm.

39:15.227 --> 39:19.266
(vehicles approaching)

39:27.239 --> 39:30.572
(walkers growling)

39:37.124 --> 39:39.991
Sasha:
Oh, shit.

39:40.169 --> 39:41.375
Rosita:
What?

39:41.545 --> 39:44.161
Dr. Carson,
Maggie's doctor.

39:44.340 --> 39:46.456
They brought him here.

39:46.634 --> 39:48.545
(walkers growling)

39:53.933 --> 39:55.924
Negan's out.

40:05.486 --> 40:07.898
Oh, he's too close.

40:09.698 --> 40:11.609
Ah, I can't get
a clean shot.

40:13.494 --> 40:15.234
Turn on the walkie.

40:23.462 --> 40:24.542
(walkie-talkie clicks, static)

40:24.713 --> 40:27.500
This is Dr. Eugene Porter,
Chief Engineer, speaking.

40:27.675 --> 40:29.256
I'm gonna need
a dozen more walkers,

40:29.427 --> 40:31.167
a.k.a. "dead ones"
in the local parlance,

40:31.345 --> 40:34.553
for expanding
the fence protocol PDQ.

40:34.723 --> 40:37.009
Actually, PFQ.

40:37.184 --> 40:39.175
This is per Negan,
who I also am,

40:39.353 --> 40:41.014
even if it takes all night
to procure them,

40:41.188 --> 40:43.179
so I need able-bodied persons
out there

40:43.357 --> 40:44.813
in the surrounding
blocks of buildings

40:44.984 --> 40:46.645
snoopin' and snatchin', stat.

40:46.819 --> 40:49.026
Negan will be indisposed
in the boudoir,

40:49.196 --> 40:50.572
so in the meantime,

40:50.739 --> 40:54.027
any questions should be
directed to yours truly.

40:54.201 --> 40:56.578
Dr. Eugene Porter,
Chief Engineer,

40:56.745 --> 40:59.532
also known as Negan,
who I am.

41:02.001 --> 41:04.162
Change of plans.

41:09.008 --> 41:11.215
So we go in.

41:12.678 --> 41:13.667
(gun cocks)

41:13.846 --> 41:15.336
I'm ready.

41:29.403 --> 41:31.109
(knock on door)

41:31.280 --> 41:32.770
Come in.

41:37.036 --> 41:39.072
Freddie said
you wanted to see me?

41:39.246 --> 41:41.623
Yes, have a seat.

41:47.129 --> 41:49.871
I noticed you've been slacking
on your scavenging

41:50.049 --> 41:51.414
and recruiting lately.

41:51.592 --> 41:55.050
And there are too many people
in your trailer.

41:55.221 --> 41:56.631
Fire hazard.

41:56.805 --> 42:00.389
Plenty of room here
at Barrington House for our guests.

42:00.559 --> 42:02.424
Speaking of which,

42:02.603 --> 42:06.767
I have job assignments
for the newcomers.

42:06.941 --> 42:08.647
People are gonna stay,
they're gonna chip in.

42:08.817 --> 42:10.899
No more free rides
on the teat.

42:11.070 --> 42:12.981
You let them
take Dr. Carson.

42:13.155 --> 42:15.316
Surpﬁsed
you didn't kneel again.

42:15.491 --> 42:16.651
You must be
really worried

42:16.825 --> 42:18.986
if you're trying
to split everyone up.

42:19.161 --> 42:20.662
(chuckles)

42:20.829 --> 42:22.569
Shouldn't talk to me
like that.

42:22.748 --> 42:24.284
Who knows
what might happen

42:24.458 --> 42:26.915
with all these Saviors
coming around?

42:27.086 --> 42:28.997
Did you just threaten me?

42:31.840 --> 42:33.671
No, lthink
you just threatened me.

42:33.842 --> 42:34.968
Think what you want.

42:35.135 --> 42:36.341
You know,
what I'm saying is,

42:36.512 --> 42:37.672
I look out
for my friends,

42:37.846 --> 42:41.680
and I realized
we're not friends.

42:41.850 --> 42:44.592
- (knock on door)
- Come in.

42:46.188 --> 42:49.305
Ah, wonderful,
tequila.

42:49.483 --> 42:51.269
Crack that open for me,
would you?

42:51.443 --> 42:53.650
You may go now.

42:53.821 --> 42:55.231
Show him out,
will you, Kal?

43:04.873 --> 43:06.409
(sighs)

43:09.962 --> 43:11.873
Everything okay?

43:12.047 --> 43:15.539
Where's Sasha and Rosita?

43:17.636 --> 43:19.172
You see that over there?

43:19.346 --> 43:22.338
That is a half-assed attempt
at a safety protocol.

43:22.516 --> 43:25.428
We need a full-assed,
full-court press.

43:25.603 --> 43:26.718
That stuff out front
with the spikes

43:26.895 --> 43:29.181
and the chains and the heads,
that's good for the optics.

43:29.356 --> 43:30.971
It sends a message
to would-be intruders

43:31.150 --> 43:32.856
of the "Don't Mess
with Texas" variety.

43:33.027 --> 43:34.517
(inhales deeply)

43:34.695 --> 43:38.358
But we need to drill down
on actual safety protocol,

43:38.532 --> 43:40.193
especially at points
that have proven to be janky.

43:40.367 --> 43:41.527
Well, yeah.

43:41.702 --> 43:43.818
That's why
I'm on guard duty now.

43:43.996 --> 43:45.736
No offense
to that last guy,

43:45.914 --> 43:47.529
but he could hardly
handle a gun.

43:47.708 --> 43:48.868
(silenced gunshot)

43:49.043 --> 43:50.158
(bodythuds)

43:50.336 --> 43:53.078
Get up.
You're getting out.

43:56.759 --> 43:58.590
Eugene, get up.

43:58.761 --> 44:00.843
We're breaking you out.

44:02.389 --> 44:04.095
Eugene!

44:06.185 --> 44:08.096
No.

44:09.396 --> 44:11.182
I'm not going with you.

44:11.357 --> 44:12.517
What?

44:14.526 --> 44:17.017
I didn't ask you to come, so go.

44:18.572 --> 44:21.154
People got to be
en route.

44:30.751 --> 44:32.616
(door closes)

44:32.795 --> 44:36.083
That weak,
lying sack of shit.

44:38.717 --> 44:40.253
This is it.

44:40.427 --> 44:43.339
I'm going in.

44:44.682 --> 44:45.888
Hold on.

44:46.058 --> 44:47.264
This is gonna
take a second.

44:47.434 --> 44:49.390
More could be coming back.
Keep an eye out.

44:52.398 --> 44:53.808
(fence clattering)

44:57.236 --> 45:00.524
Sasha:
Just another second.

45:07.246 --> 45:08.281
What the hell
are you doing?

45:08.455 --> 45:09.831
Go.

45:09.998 --> 45:11.659
It's not your time.

45:11.834 --> 45:15.418
There's got to be
a point to it, right?

45:15.587 --> 45:16.963
They need you.

45:22.261 --> 45:25.219
(silenced gunshot)

45:27.808 --> 45:28.968
(groans)

45:29.143 --> 45:32.806
(indistinct shouting,
machine-gun fire)

45:32.980 --> 45:38.020
(machine-gun fire continues)

45:38.193 --> 45:42.027
(music playing)

45:48.996 --> 45:53.831
(crying)

45:54.001 --> 45:56.617
Damn it.

45:56.795 --> 45:59.377
Damn it!

45:59.548 --> 46:02.506
(sobbing)

46:13.061 --> 46:17.145
(music playing)

46:44.176 --> 46:46.087
