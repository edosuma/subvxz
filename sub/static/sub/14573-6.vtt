WEBVTT

00:05.506 --> 00:07.241
(whispers)
Shit.

00:08.042 --> 00:10.644
(sighs)

00:10.678 --> 00:15.483
Oh, God.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.017
Jesus Christ, man.

00:17.051 --> 00:18.252
I'm sorry,
I used your shower.

00:18.286 --> 00:22.990
Well, we got-- We have
bigger towels than that, dude.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.892
Sorry.

00:24.925 --> 00:26.494
What's wrong?

00:26.527 --> 00:29.163
Just keyboard's broken,

00:29.197 --> 00:31.565
and I can't get the "J"
or the "L" keys to work.

00:31.599 --> 00:33.934
What, are you
trying to spell July?

00:33.967 --> 00:35.569
Why don't you get an iPhone,
for God's sake?

00:35.603 --> 00:36.937
I don't want one.

00:36.970 --> 00:38.106
Let me see,
I can fix those.

00:38.139 --> 00:39.773
I got it.
Just give it to me.

00:39.807 --> 00:40.941
I can fix it.

00:40.974 --> 00:42.443
I know how to fix these--
I got it.

00:42.476 --> 00:44.278
Lou, I can fix these
Blackberries.

00:44.312 --> 00:45.045
I got it.

00:45.079 --> 00:46.247
Just give me the phone.
Stop it.

00:46.280 --> 00:47.381
You're being a dummy.

00:47.415 --> 00:48.849
Just give me the--
Get outta here.

00:48.882 --> 00:49.917
Give me the phone
for God's sake.

00:49.950 --> 00:52.520
I can fix it!
Get off of me!

00:52.553 --> 00:54.955
Seriously.

00:54.988 --> 00:57.091
Sorry.

01:01.229 --> 01:05.099
(mouthing words)

01:13.341 --> 01:16.510
**

01:28.489 --> 01:30.791
Jesus...

01:37.598 --> 01:39.133
Hi, stupid asshole.

01:39.167 --> 01:43.737
(laughing)

01:43.771 --> 01:47.275
Look at your face.

01:48.976 --> 01:51.512
Aww.

01:52.613 --> 01:55.483
Hey.

02:03.991 --> 02:07.828
So, Europe was a bust.

02:07.861 --> 02:09.430
Sur's dad looked
like he was trying

02:09.463 --> 02:11.165
for about two months there.

02:11.199 --> 02:14.468
I pretended like I wanted
to make it work,

02:14.502 --> 02:17.871
but the truth
comes out, man.

02:17.905 --> 02:20.708
You know, we're just
not two people

02:20.741 --> 02:21.975
who are meant to
be together.

02:22.009 --> 02:24.878
Sur and his dad,
on the other hand,

02:24.912 --> 02:27.815
very happy,

02:27.848 --> 02:29.016
and he's good with him,

02:29.049 --> 02:33.254
so I left them both
in Barcelona.

02:34.355 --> 02:38.492
I'll get him back
in time for school next year.

02:39.193 --> 02:43.897
So... got lots
of free time.

02:43.931 --> 02:44.965
I'm here.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.734
I'm down to hang.

02:46.767 --> 02:49.002
**

02:49.036 --> 02:52.540
Hello? Hello?

02:52.573 --> 02:54.475
Are there any
people in there?

02:54.508 --> 02:57.411
Did a plant make
a new one of you?

02:57.445 --> 02:59.580
What's wrong?
Am I in trouble?

02:59.613 --> 03:01.815
Are you gonna screech
at me now?

03:01.849 --> 03:03.351
(screams)

03:10.090 --> 03:15.729
Look, I thought
about you...

03:15.763 --> 03:17.665
...a lot.

03:17.698 --> 03:22.670
You got under my skin
from far away,

03:22.703 --> 03:25.739
and I mean--

03:25.773 --> 03:27.174
(sighs)

03:27.207 --> 03:31.211
If you want to try
to pursue a...

03:31.245 --> 03:34.382
...guy-girl,

03:34.415 --> 03:40.588
kissing-type-of-thing...

03:40.621 --> 03:46.126
I'm willing to go
down that road with you,

03:46.159 --> 03:47.928
if you're interested.

03:47.961 --> 03:49.863
I'm with somebody now.

03:49.897 --> 03:54.201
What?
No, you're not.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.537
No one wants to
be with you, Louie.

03:56.570 --> 03:57.705
Stop lying.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.707
(laughing)

03:59.740 --> 04:01.375
Oh, my God.

04:01.409 --> 04:03.210
Look at your face.

04:03.243 --> 04:07.481
Wait, hold on.

04:09.317 --> 04:11.685
Oh, my God.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.891
Look, I don't know
what you've got

04:17.925 --> 04:19.259
going on with who,

04:19.293 --> 04:21.395
but this is me
you're talking to.

04:21.429 --> 04:23.697
Look, it's really
good to see you.

04:25.198 --> 04:26.667
It really is,
you know?

04:26.700 --> 04:27.735
(clears throat)

04:27.768 --> 04:30.838
But I got something
going on now.

04:30.871 --> 04:34.608
That's what's--
That's what's going on with me.

04:34.642 --> 04:36.644
Oh, hmm.

04:36.677 --> 04:37.811
All right, then.

04:37.845 --> 04:42.182
Well, that's all
very official and clear.

04:42.215 --> 04:44.184
That's what's going on
with you.

04:44.217 --> 04:46.286
Mm, very good.
Very good, sir.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.922
Yeah, I gotta--
I gotta go.

04:48.956 --> 04:49.957
You gotta go.

04:49.990 --> 04:53.160
You got a big relationship
with like the President

04:53.193 --> 04:54.762
or something, yeah.

04:54.795 --> 04:55.996
I'll see you later.

04:56.029 --> 04:58.599
Hey, what are you doing?

04:58.632 --> 05:00.934
You're not leaving?
Are you serious?

05:00.968 --> 05:03.637
Yeah, I gotta--
I gotta go.

05:03.671 --> 05:08.308
Louie... Louie.

05:12.413 --> 05:16.784
Okay, well, um,
I'm very happy for you.

05:16.817 --> 05:20.488
Congratulations.

05:30.498 --> 05:33.734
Folks, folks,
you gotta get out of the way.

05:33.767 --> 05:36.470
That guy is in a big
relationship now.

05:36.504 --> 05:38.706
Seriously, make way.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.808
Big stuff.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.377
It's really big stuff.

05:44.077 --> 05:46.346
(knocking)

05:49.883 --> 05:51.585
Oh.

05:53.253 --> 05:54.655
Hello.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.690
Hi.
Hi, is Amia here?

05:56.724 --> 05:57.825
Yes, come in.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.093
Oh, thank you.

06:00.127 --> 06:01.361
How're you doing?

06:01.395 --> 06:02.262
I am good.

06:02.295 --> 06:03.697
You all right?
Yeah, and you?

06:03.731 --> 06:04.698
Good, good.

06:04.732 --> 06:05.999
Hey, I got a great
question for you.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.000
What is that?

06:07.034 --> 06:08.436
What is your name?

06:08.469 --> 06:09.437
(both laughing)

06:09.470 --> 06:11.004
Ivanka.
Ivanka.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.372
Okay, Ivanka.

06:12.406 --> 06:14.274
She's in here.

06:14.307 --> 06:15.543
Amia?

06:18.946 --> 06:20.681
Hi.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.950
Hey, hey, uh,
just one second.

06:22.983 --> 06:25.953
Can you do me a favor
and, uh, tell her

06:25.986 --> 06:28.388
I'd like to go
to dinner with her tonight.

06:28.422 --> 06:29.356
Can you ask her?

06:29.389 --> 06:30.591
Why don't you tell her?

06:30.624 --> 06:33.894
Oh, come on,
come on, man.

06:33.927 --> 06:39.733
(speaking Hungarian)

06:41.635 --> 06:43.303
Ah.

06:43.336 --> 06:48.208
She, um, she wants you
to know that she is

06:48.241 --> 06:50.143
going back to Hungary.

06:50.177 --> 06:52.045
She is not staying here.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.047
She lives there in Hungary.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.883
She has a son.

06:55.916 --> 07:01.555
And, uh, she's
going back, and--

07:01.589 --> 07:05.325
Oh, oh, and she liked
very much to be with you.

07:05.358 --> 07:08.395
Can you tell her
don't go?

07:08.428 --> 07:10.498
Please tell her don't go.

07:10.531 --> 07:11.732
Oh, but you see--

07:11.765 --> 07:13.000
I know,
I get it, I get it.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.301
I-I-- she's got a kid.

07:14.334 --> 07:16.069
Everybody's got a kid,
it's okay.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.237
I mean, is she married?

07:17.270 --> 07:18.238
Is she married?

07:18.271 --> 07:20.273
No.
Then don't go.

07:20.307 --> 07:22.242
Please tell--
Just tell her I said stay.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.911
Tell her I said stay.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.980
(speaking Hungarian)

07:27.014 --> 07:30.183
Stay, you know?
Come on, just stay.

07:30.217 --> 07:33.787
Ma-- what? Marad, marad.

07:33.821 --> 07:35.623
Stay, stay here.

07:35.656 --> 07:36.757
Marad.

07:36.790 --> 07:40.661
Marad, marad,
marad, marad.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.262
Marad, stay.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.531
I'm not--
I mean I really--

07:43.564 --> 07:46.600
Look, just-- I-I don't
know you.

07:46.634 --> 07:47.968
I wanna know you.

07:48.001 --> 07:50.303
It's only been one day
that I spend with you,

07:50.337 --> 07:52.205
but don't go
all of a sudden.

07:52.239 --> 07:53.273
I know this is a good idea.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.542
This looks crazy, right?

07:54.575 --> 07:55.342
This is stupid?

07:55.375 --> 07:57.177
But this is a good idea.

07:57.210 --> 07:59.479
I know this is,
please don't go.

07:59.513 --> 08:01.348
Please don't go.

08:01.381 --> 08:03.383
No, come down--

08:03.416 --> 08:05.519
Don't go.
Why go?

08:05.553 --> 08:09.489
(speaking Hungarian)

08:21.501 --> 08:23.303
Okay?

08:23.336 --> 08:24.404
She wants you to know--

08:24.437 --> 08:25.973
No, no, I got it,
I got it.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.808
No, but--

08:27.841 --> 08:29.910
No, no,
I got-- I-I got it.

08:29.943 --> 08:30.878
I got it, thanks.

08:30.911 --> 08:31.979
That was nice.

08:32.012 --> 08:35.515
I just-- I...

08:35.549 --> 08:41.989
Uh, I really had
a good time with you.

08:42.022 --> 08:42.890
Thank you.

08:42.923 --> 08:46.660
And it's nice
to have met you.

08:46.694 --> 08:53.533
Um... I'll see you,
thank you, thanks.

09:07.047 --> 09:13.987
(breathing heavily)

09:19.392 --> 09:25.599
(chords banging)

09:31.238 --> 09:35.743
(doorbell)

09:42.115 --> 09:43.784
Oh.

09:43.817 --> 09:44.785
Hi.

09:44.818 --> 09:47.621
Uh, hi.

09:47.655 --> 09:49.422
(bat clatters)

09:49.456 --> 09:56.296
Sorry, I was, uh,
cleaning... the piano.

09:56.329 --> 10:02.302
Amia wanted me to tell you
that you didn't really hear

10:02.335 --> 10:06.339
or understand what it is that
she wanted to say to you.

10:06.373 --> 10:07.775
Okay.

10:07.808 --> 10:12.746
You see, she, um, is here
for one month to help me

10:12.780 --> 10:16.483
to move back to Hungary
to live there, you know,

10:16.516 --> 10:19.753
because it's time for me
to go home.

10:19.787 --> 10:23.924
And, um, so she will
be here for one month,

10:23.957 --> 10:28.095
and she very much would like
to see you again,

10:28.128 --> 10:30.430
but she just
wanted me to tell you

10:30.463 --> 10:32.299
that she's leaving so that,
you know,

10:32.332 --> 10:36.770
everything is--
Everything is said, you know?

10:36.804 --> 10:39.840
So, she would like
to see you again

10:39.873 --> 10:43.543
if that is okay with you
that she will be leaving.

10:43.576 --> 10:45.378
Okay.

10:45.412 --> 10:47.180
Well, tell her thank you.

10:47.214 --> 10:50.517
Uh, I'd very much like
to see her again,

10:50.550 --> 10:52.686
and could you please tell her

10:52.720 --> 10:55.188
that I'd love to take her
to dinner tomorrow.

10:55.222 --> 10:56.389
You tell her.

10:56.423 --> 10:57.791
Okay, okay.

10:57.825 --> 11:01.461
Tomorrow, uh, seven.

11:01.494 --> 11:04.131
Din-- you and me, dinner.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.298
Okay?

11:05.332 --> 11:07.534
(Hungarian)

11:07.567 --> 11:08.501
Okay.

11:08.535 --> 11:12.505
Thank you for-- Thank you.
Thank you.

11:12.539 --> 11:13.807
Oh, can you tell her--

11:13.841 --> 11:16.844
Just let her know I have
two daughters, okay?

11:16.877 --> 11:19.312
Girls, eight and thirteen.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.181
I will tell her.
Tell her that.

11:21.214 --> 11:24.852
Okay.
Thank you.

11:26.019 --> 11:28.688
(laughing)

11:32.259 --> 11:34.694
(sighs)

11:37.765 --> 11:40.901
I'm sorry that
I ripped your skirt off.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.936
And I was behaving badly.

11:42.970 --> 11:47.507
I know even when I'm upset,
I can't hurt someone else.

11:47.540 --> 11:51.178
I'm very sorry.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.080
Okay.

11:53.113 --> 11:54.381
Thank you, Jane.

11:54.414 --> 11:58.886
Thank you, Marcy.

12:03.423 --> 12:08.195
Jane, can you wait outside
while I speak to your parents?

12:08.228 --> 12:11.131
Okay.

12:13.333 --> 12:16.369
So, what's the plan?

12:16.403 --> 12:17.637
What's the plan?

12:17.670 --> 12:18.705
Yes.

12:18.738 --> 12:21.374
It's time to make
a plan for Jane.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.376
Do you have one?

12:23.410 --> 12:24.845
Um...

12:26.413 --> 12:32.652
We're--
we're kinda, um--

12:32.685 --> 12:33.653
Okay.

12:33.686 --> 12:35.488
Clearly, you two
are not communicating,

12:35.522 --> 12:36.489
which is a problem.

12:36.523 --> 12:38.658
You need to communicate.

12:38.691 --> 12:40.760
Tell you what--
I'm gonna go down the hall.

12:40.794 --> 12:43.897
Why don't you two sit here
and devote a few minutes

12:43.931 --> 12:47.434
to talking
constructively about Jane.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.202
Okay?

13:21.301 --> 13:23.036
Hey.
Hey, hi.

13:23.070 --> 13:24.037
Hi.

13:24.071 --> 13:27.274
Hey, this is, uh--
This is my daughter, Jane.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.442
Jane, Jane?

13:29.476 --> 13:30.543
Yeah.
Hi.

13:30.577 --> 13:33.380
This is Amia,
she's my friend.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.382
Uh, doesn't speak English.

13:35.415 --> 13:36.449
She's Hungarian.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.351
Oh.
Szervusz.

13:38.385 --> 13:39.452
Szervusz!

13:39.486 --> 13:40.653
What's that?

13:40.687 --> 13:44.291
It's "hello" in Hungarian.

13:44.324 --> 13:48.295
(speaking Hungarian)

13:48.328 --> 13:49.829
Minute.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.511
Ah.

14:04.544 --> 14:06.846
Oh.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.983
I didn't know--
I didn't know...

14:10.017 --> 14:14.154
(speaks Hungarian)

14:14.187 --> 14:17.257
**

15:30.530 --> 15:31.898
Hey!

15:31.931 --> 15:34.567
(clapping)

15:34.601 --> 15:35.735
Okay.

15:35.768 --> 15:39.372
Szervusz.
Szervusz.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.680
Let's go, come on.

15:47.714 --> 15:49.182
You got homework.

15:49.216 --> 15:50.250
I don't wanna do homework.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.751
I know you don't,
come on.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.120
Listen, can I just do
the violin?

15:53.153 --> 15:55.622
No, 'cause you're already
good at violin, you see.

15:55.655 --> 15:58.591
So you need to balance
your education and develop.

15:58.625 --> 15:59.859
Come on,
that's boring stuff.

15:59.892 --> 16:01.961
Yeah, it's boring,
but later in life--

16:06.066 --> 16:07.500
It's pretty good.

16:07.534 --> 16:09.969
Yeah?

16:22.849 --> 16:24.851
All right,
see you later, dude.

16:24.884 --> 16:26.819
Have a great day,
all right?

16:26.853 --> 16:28.221
Daddy?

16:28.255 --> 16:28.888
Yeah?

16:28.921 --> 16:32.892
Is everybody mad at me?

16:32.925 --> 16:35.662
Nope.

16:35.695 --> 16:39.566
I mean I worry about you.

16:39.599 --> 16:43.002
But I never really get
mad at you, Jane.

16:43.036 --> 16:49.476
I just-- I--
It's my job to help you be,

16:49.509 --> 16:52.645
you know, a person
that can live in the world

16:52.679 --> 16:54.481
and be easy to be around.

16:54.514 --> 16:55.815
That's all.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.884
Well, am I easy
to be around?

16:57.917 --> 17:00.253
Yeah, you really are.

17:00.287 --> 17:02.322
I love being with you.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.524
It's like my
fourth favorite thing.

17:04.557 --> 17:07.026
What are the first three?

17:07.060 --> 17:13.266
Uh, okay, number three,
riding elephants.

17:13.300 --> 17:14.734
Love it.

17:14.767 --> 17:17.704
Number two,
collecting hydrogen.

17:17.737 --> 17:19.506
Cool.
Stars are made out of it.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.441
Yeah, my hydrogen collection
is awesome. Yes.

17:21.474 --> 17:27.914
And number one would have to be
remembering being with you.

17:27.947 --> 17:29.682
That's my favorite.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.851
Bye, daddy.
See you later.

17:31.884 --> 17:32.752
Take it easy.

17:32.785 --> 17:34.521
Have a good one.

17:34.554 --> 17:35.688
Bye.

17:35.722 --> 17:36.856
Bye, daddy.

17:36.889 --> 17:40.493
So long, sucker.

17:41.728 --> 17:44.697
(man)
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.366
Take it easy,
take it easy.

17:46.399 --> 17:47.534
Easy.

17:47.567 --> 17:48.701
Hey, Dr. Bigelow.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.270
Hi.
Yes, yes.

17:50.303 --> 17:51.704
Hey, hi.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.706
Hey, my back
is much better.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.208
So...

17:55.242 --> 17:56.209
Better than what?

17:56.243 --> 17:59.546
Oh, well, you know
my back was hurting,

17:59.579 --> 18:00.813
and it's better now.

18:00.847 --> 18:01.981
So, thank you.

18:02.014 --> 18:03.950
Oh, yeah.

18:03.983 --> 18:05.318
I don't think I had
anything to do with that.

18:05.352 --> 18:06.553
Easy, easy,
easy, boy.

18:06.586 --> 18:07.720
Easy, boy.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.422
Sit, sit, sit,
okay, okay.

18:09.456 --> 18:10.723
Yes, what?

18:10.757 --> 18:15.228
Oh, nothing, just I've been
dating this girl.

18:15.262 --> 18:18.931
I'm-- I just--
I was dating this woman,

18:18.965 --> 18:20.567
and she's leaving
the country,

18:20.600 --> 18:22.135
so I don't know if--
It's kinda confusing.

18:22.169 --> 18:24.103
I don't know if
I should keep dating her.

18:24.137 --> 18:27.740
I-I don't understand why
I'm hearing about this.

18:27.774 --> 18:30.410
I'm sorry,
I just--

18:30.443 --> 18:32.645
When I was in your office,
you gave me really good advice,

18:32.679 --> 18:37.184
you know, philosophically,
so I guess I--

18:37.217 --> 18:40.587
So you-- you want me
to advise you about what?

18:40.620 --> 18:42.955
I've been-- Okay, I've been
dating this woman.

18:42.989 --> 18:44.491
And I don't know if
I should keep dating her

18:44.524 --> 18:46.025
because she's leaving
the country.

18:46.058 --> 18:47.794
I'm not gonna get
to stay with her.

18:47.827 --> 18:53.333
And I'm liking her more
and more, so it's-- You know?

18:53.366 --> 18:54.301
(sighs)

18:54.334 --> 18:55.702
Here's what
I can tell you.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.270
In medical school,

18:57.304 --> 18:59.172
they tell you about
thousands of things

18:59.206 --> 19:01.374
that can happen
to the human body,

19:01.408 --> 19:05.111
diseases and maladies
that you could never dream up.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.046
There's a thing where
your bones dissolve,

19:07.079 --> 19:09.449
and you become
just a sack of organs.

19:09.482 --> 19:14.187
People are born sometimes
with no eyes, with no face.

19:14.221 --> 19:15.322
They're rare,

19:15.355 --> 19:19.626
but neurological diseases
that eat half of your brain.

19:19.659 --> 19:20.793
People are born sick,

19:20.827 --> 19:22.862
and they never
know a moment

19:22.895 --> 19:28.134
of anything but pain
and suffering.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.503
(sighs)

19:30.537 --> 19:32.305
So?

19:32.339 --> 19:37.043
So, nobody cares whether
you date this girl

19:37.076 --> 19:38.378
or whether you don't.

19:38.411 --> 19:43.182
Just pick a road
and go down it, or don't.

19:43.216 --> 19:45.685
But there's gotta be
a way to decide

19:45.718 --> 19:47.820
which one's gonna
make me happier.

19:47.854 --> 19:48.821
To predict--

19:48.855 --> 19:51.190
Take a look at this dog.

19:51.224 --> 19:53.059
What's his name?
Doesn't have one.

19:53.092 --> 19:54.694
How many legs does it have?

19:54.727 --> 19:56.195
Three.

19:56.229 --> 19:57.697
The answer is
it has plenty of legs.

19:57.730 --> 19:58.865
It had four,

19:58.898 --> 20:01.568
a coyote in Poughkeepsie
chewed the other one off.

20:01.601 --> 20:04.671
Look at his face,
perfectly happy.

20:04.704 --> 20:05.838
Belly is full.

20:05.872 --> 20:10.009
Just looking, waiting
to see what comes next.

20:10.042 --> 20:15.915
Do you know the only thing
happier than a three-legged dog?

20:15.948 --> 20:18.184
A four-legged dog.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.520
Now, if you'll excuse me,

20:20.553 --> 20:23.390
this dog would like
to get some air.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.700
(belching)

20:33.733 --> 20:36.769
(both laughing)

20:55.922 --> 20:57.424
Do it again.
Ready?
