WEBVTT

00:00.326 --> 00:03.594
On this episode of "MythBusters"...

00:03.644 --> 00:05.311
we lock and load...

00:06.277 --> 00:07.431
...get lost...

00:07.433 --> 00:09.642
Behold the Hyneman
in his natural habitat.

00:09.644 --> 00:11.071
...and let loose.

00:11.073 --> 00:12.302
Whoa!

00:12.304 --> 00:14.036
First up, Adam and Jamie

00:14.038 --> 00:15.994
look into the age-old anomaly

00:15.996 --> 00:17.596
that while blindfolded...

00:17.598 --> 00:19.423
I feel like I'm doing pretty good.

00:19.425 --> 00:21.424
...it's supposedly impossible

00:21.426 --> 00:23.256
to travel in a straight line.

00:23.258 --> 00:25.618
You drove us into the middle of a field.

00:25.620 --> 00:27.553
- Then...
- Somebody order a car?

00:27.555 --> 00:31.582
Kari, Grant, and Tory
find out if a fender bender...

00:31.584 --> 00:33.350
- Whoo!
- Whoa!

00:33.352 --> 00:34.850
...could detonate a trunk full

00:34.852 --> 00:37.614
of special-effects explosives.

00:37.616 --> 00:39.378
This is our target car.

00:39.380 --> 00:42.710
Stand by for a rocket-propelled car crash.

00:42.712 --> 00:44.178
Oh, my God. What just happened?

00:44.180 --> 00:45.543
I don't know!

00:48.111 --> 00:51.343
Who are the MythBusters?

00:51.345 --> 00:52.211
Adam Savage...

00:53.580 --> 00:54.979
I am the master of this stunt!

00:54.981 --> 00:58.013
- ...and Jamie Hyneman.
- Bye-bye!

00:58.015 --> 01:02.281
Between them, more than 30 years
of special-effects experience.

01:02.283 --> 01:04.181
Together with Grant Imahara...

01:04.183 --> 01:05.013
Whoo!

01:05.016 --> 01:05.814
...Kari Byron...

01:05.816 --> 01:07.613
Hi, Grant!

01:07.615 --> 01:09.546
- ...and Tory Belleci.
- Hit it!

01:09.548 --> 01:12.812
They don't just tell the myths.

01:12.814 --> 01:14.745
They put them to the test.

01:15.747 --> 01:18.747

01:22.411 --> 01:24.744
Watch out, because Adam and Jamie

01:24.746 --> 01:29.378
are about to walk, swim,
and drive blindfolded.

01:29.380 --> 01:30.879
What's with the blindfold?

01:30.881 --> 01:32.713
Ah, well, you ever work on something,

01:32.715 --> 01:34.347
and it's not going
the way you want it to,

01:34.349 --> 01:36.715
and you feel like you're just
going around in circles?

01:36.717 --> 01:38.617
I know exactly what you mean.

01:38.619 --> 01:41.451
Excellent, because that is what
this story is all about.

01:41.453 --> 01:44.452
The myth is that a human when blindfolded

01:44.454 --> 01:47.586
- cannot travel in a straight line.
- Really?

01:47.588 --> 01:50.387
It turns out that not only can't
we walk in a straight line

01:50.389 --> 01:51.755
but that left to our own devices,

01:51.757 --> 01:54.288
we will actually walk in circles

01:54.290 --> 01:55.622
and that this might be one of the reasons

01:55.624 --> 01:57.689
we might get lost in the woods.

01:57.691 --> 01:59.090
I thought with all
your survival training,

01:59.092 --> 02:00.757
you'd love this story.

02:00.759 --> 02:02.991
Hello? Jamie?

02:02.993 --> 02:05.692
Oh, he's gone.

02:06.927 --> 02:09.526
It's a deceptively simple concept

02:09.529 --> 02:13.063
that has puzzled serious
scientists for 100 years.

02:13.065 --> 02:14.931
Supposedly, when blindfolded,

02:14.933 --> 02:17.466
it's impossible for humans to travel,

02:17.468 --> 02:20.301
whether on foot, in water, or by road,

02:20.303 --> 02:21.335
in a straight line.

02:21.337 --> 02:22.402
It's a challenge

02:22.404 --> 02:25.403
Adam and Jamie just can't resist.

02:25.405 --> 02:27.271
Come on. Come on back in here.

02:27.273 --> 02:29.239
Did you even hear a word that I said?

02:29.241 --> 02:31.840
Yeah. Humans can't move in a
straight line while blindfolded.

02:31.842 --> 02:32.841
That's the story.

02:32.843 --> 02:34.075
How do you want to test it?

02:34.077 --> 02:35.809
Well, when I think
about moving in a straight line,

02:35.811 --> 02:36.910
I think about walking.

02:36.912 --> 02:38.344
I think you might be right.

02:38.346 --> 02:39.678
- Is that where you want to begin?
- Yeah.

02:39.680 --> 02:41.312
All we need is a couple blindfolds

02:41.314 --> 02:42.746
and a big wide-open field.

02:42.748 --> 02:44.114
Let's do it.

02:44.116 --> 02:46.115
A big field you say?

02:46.117 --> 02:47.415
How about this one?

02:47.417 --> 02:49.516
Our testing here is pretty straightforward.

02:49.518 --> 02:51.751
We've got a field
in which we can walk 3,000 feet

02:51.753 --> 02:53.686
in any direction that we chose.

02:53.688 --> 02:55.320
We've got a blindfold...

02:55.322 --> 02:57.622
this one here is from
my personal collection...

02:57.624 --> 03:00.324
and headphones to remove
any other stimulus.

03:00.326 --> 03:02.192
And we're just gonna try
and walk in a straight line

03:02.194 --> 03:03.260
and see what happens.

03:03.262 --> 03:04.995
Sure, we'll see what happens,

03:04.997 --> 03:08.197
but Jamie likes to be more science-y.

03:08.199 --> 03:09.765
We've got three ways
of telling how good we are

03:09.767 --> 03:11.800
at walking in a straight line
while blindfolded.

03:11.802 --> 03:15.369
First is by using the global
positioning system, or GPS.

03:15.371 --> 03:17.471
This little thing
will be plotting a map for us

03:17.473 --> 03:19.406
that we can look at afterwards.

03:19.408 --> 03:22.175
Secondly, we've got
these lovely little orange flags

03:22.177 --> 03:23.242
that we can place.

03:23.244 --> 03:24.977
- Are you ready to go?
- What?

03:24.979 --> 03:26.178
Oh!

03:26.180 --> 03:29.180
Then lastly, we'll know
if we hit the target

03:29.182 --> 03:31.215
because we will have had to have walked

03:31.217 --> 03:33.451
in more or less a straight line
to get there.

03:33.453 --> 03:35.819
How do I think I'm gonna do?

03:35.821 --> 03:37.286
I don't think I'm gonna be able

03:37.288 --> 03:39.055
to maintain an incredibly straight line,

03:39.057 --> 03:40.555
but I don't think
I'm gonna be that far off.

03:40.557 --> 03:43.191
I think I may veer
to the left or to the right,

03:43.193 --> 03:45.259
but I think I'll end up
pretty close to my goal

03:45.261 --> 03:47.527
of that cluster of trees over there.

03:47.529 --> 03:48.695
Or is it there?

03:48.697 --> 03:52.931
Okay, in 3, 2, 1, go!

03:52.933 --> 03:54.665
All he has to do

03:54.667 --> 03:57.767
is walk in a straight line
with his eyes closed.

03:57.769 --> 03:59.202
How hard can it be?

03:59.204 --> 04:01.970
It is a very weird thing

04:01.972 --> 04:04.706
to be walking without
any visual or auditory stimulus.

04:04.708 --> 04:06.007
What's really weird

04:06.009 --> 04:09.577
is, apparently, how
surprisingly difficult it is.

04:09.579 --> 04:12.146
You're holding a picture
of it in your head,

04:12.148 --> 04:13.981
and in your mind's eye,

04:13.983 --> 04:16.483
you're walking a nice straight trajectory

04:16.486 --> 04:18.119
across that landscape.

04:18.120 --> 04:19.620
Tickling at the back of your mind,

04:19.623 --> 04:21.289
you're thinking something might be wrong,

04:21.291 --> 04:23.925
but try as you might, you feel
like you're walking straight.

04:23.927 --> 04:25.660
Whoa!

04:25.662 --> 04:26.961
Whoa!

04:28.898 --> 04:30.131
You started out pretty nice,

04:30.133 --> 04:32.233
but after about 300 feet or so,

04:32.235 --> 04:34.068
you started to turn to the left,

04:34.070 --> 04:35.837
and you just kept doing that

04:35.839 --> 04:38.273
until you ended up
right back at the fence.

04:38.275 --> 04:42.077
I swear I thought I was walking
a perfectly straight line.

04:42.079 --> 04:44.946
Nothing told me
that I was possibly walking

04:44.948 --> 04:47.616
in a 200-foot-diameter circle.

04:47.618 --> 04:50.084
I am totally amazed by that result.

04:50.086 --> 04:53.421
A result nailed by the GPS trail.

04:53.423 --> 04:55.089
The astonishing disparity

04:55.091 --> 04:58.525
between Adam's perception
and his actual route

04:58.527 --> 05:00.594
is there for all to see.

05:02.898 --> 05:04.732
That is hilarious.

05:04.734 --> 05:06.801
It's a result that begs several questions.

05:06.803 --> 05:10.605
The first of which is,
will Jamie do any better?

05:10.607 --> 05:12.807
Jamie is blind man walking

05:12.809 --> 05:16.846
in 3, 2, 1, go!

05:16.848 --> 05:19.348
With all the confidence and certainty

05:19.350 --> 05:20.850
you'd expect from the Hyneman,

05:20.852 --> 05:23.419
he strides off towards the target tree...

05:23.421 --> 05:28.090
before veering off course
like he's got a short right leg.

05:28.092 --> 05:31.493
And any doubt that subtle
topographical features

05:31.495 --> 05:33.529
were the reason Adam went left

05:33.531 --> 05:37.399
are dispelled as Jamie
leans so far to the right,

05:37.401 --> 05:40.869
he turns back on himself
in a corkscrew pattern.

05:40.871 --> 05:44.873
I ended up right back
at the road just like you did.

05:44.875 --> 05:47.042
Time to delve deeper.

05:47.044 --> 05:49.044
Now, the question we have is,

05:49.046 --> 05:50.712
is that leaning that we each had

05:50.714 --> 05:52.648
to one direction or the other consistent?

05:52.650 --> 05:54.883
Walking blind... test number two.

05:54.885 --> 05:56.719
Is it something
that could be corrected for?

05:56.721 --> 05:58.187
Well, that's what
we're just about to find out.

06:00.190 --> 06:02.625
He's doing a little better this time.

06:02.627 --> 06:04.961
Adam's start is certainly straighter,

06:04.963 --> 06:06.996
but it's not long before the test

06:06.998 --> 06:09.532
literally takes a turn for the worse.

06:09.534 --> 06:11.600
Test two, I didn't walk straight,

06:11.602 --> 06:12.902
and I didn't even walk straight

06:12.904 --> 06:14.503
in the same way I didn't walk
straight the first time.

06:14.505 --> 06:16.338
I went in a circle
in the other direction.

06:16.340 --> 06:19.775
Yeah, two things are clear
from Adam's second test.

06:19.777 --> 06:22.011
His route is far from straight,

06:22.013 --> 06:25.615
and there's no discernable
pattern to his meandering.

06:25.617 --> 06:26.950
- Bye.
- Bye.

06:26.952 --> 06:30.053
A theory compounded on Jamie's second test

06:30.055 --> 06:31.421
because once again,

06:31.423 --> 06:35.025
he immediately heads off
in the wrong direction.

06:35.027 --> 06:36.693
I'm lost.

06:36.695 --> 06:38.061
Trying to walk in a straight line

06:38.063 --> 06:39.362
while being blindfolded

06:39.364 --> 06:41.030
is an exercise in futility

06:41.032 --> 06:46.370
because without any cues
like vision or sounds and so on,

06:46.372 --> 06:49.306
you're relying on purely mechanical means

06:49.308 --> 06:51.275
of determining your direction.

06:51.277 --> 06:53.610
I feel like he's Don Quixote,

06:53.612 --> 06:55.145
and I'm following him around.

06:55.147 --> 06:57.815
But you're fluid.
You're not like a machine.

06:57.817 --> 07:00.218
You can kind of meander and wander,

07:00.220 --> 07:03.520
and, in fact, that's kind of
what these GPS paths

07:03.522 --> 07:04.621
are showing,

07:04.623 --> 07:07.324
is this looks like a meandering stream.

07:07.326 --> 07:09.693
And that meandering corkscrewing

07:09.695 --> 07:12.496
leads Jamie and Adam
straight to a firm conclusion.

07:12.498 --> 07:13.563
Stop.

07:13.565 --> 07:15.165
We came here to look at the myth

07:15.167 --> 07:18.401
that a person who is blindfolded
cannot walk in a straight line,

07:18.403 --> 07:20.370
and we have definitely proven that

07:20.372 --> 07:22.005
with the data we've gathered.

07:22.007 --> 07:25.008
But the myth specifically says travel

07:25.010 --> 07:26.410
and not just walk.

07:26.412 --> 07:29.513
So to complete the data set
and nail the science,

07:29.515 --> 07:33.383
Adam and Jamie will be hitting
the highways and waterways,

07:33.385 --> 07:37.655
attempting alternative forms
of blindfold locomotion.

07:37.657 --> 07:38.990
What's next?

07:38.992 --> 07:40.091
Swimming blindfolded.

07:40.093 --> 07:41.760
- Well, we can't do that here.
- No.

07:41.762 --> 07:43.761
- Let's go someplace else.
- All right.

07:45.000 --> 07:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:54.940 --> 07:56.007
You're gonna love this one.

07:56.009 --> 07:58.143
This myth is about a binary explosive

07:58.145 --> 08:00.145
that is used in Hollywood effects films.

08:00.147 --> 08:03.082
A guy is transporting it
in the trunk of his car.

08:03.084 --> 08:06.052
He gets rear-ended, and the car explodes.

08:06.054 --> 08:07.119
Now, here's the thing.

08:07.121 --> 08:08.254
Under normal conditions,

08:08.256 --> 08:10.089
until you mix the two parts together,

08:10.091 --> 08:12.457
the explosive is completely stable.

08:12.459 --> 08:14.559
But once they're mixed,
you can set it off

08:14.561 --> 08:16.328
by shooting it with a bullet.

08:16.330 --> 08:17.596
Okay, so, the myth here

08:17.598 --> 08:19.263
is that the impact from a car crash

08:19.265 --> 08:20.531
has enough energy

08:20.533 --> 08:23.934
to actually set off this
supposedly stable explosive.

08:23.936 --> 08:25.002
Exactly.

08:25.004 --> 08:26.904
Guns, car crashes, explosions...

08:26.906 --> 08:29.539
- I mean, it doesn't get any better than this.
- No.

08:29.541 --> 08:32.107
It's the rear-end
fender bender from Hollywood

08:32.110 --> 08:34.744
that was never meant to end up on screen.

08:34.746 --> 08:38.181
Considering it usually requires
the impact of a gunshot

08:38.183 --> 08:39.582
to set it off,

08:39.583 --> 08:43.251
can a trunk full of
special-effects binary explosive

08:43.254 --> 08:46.456
really go ka-blooey in a car crash?

08:46.458 --> 08:47.724
This is the first time

08:47.726 --> 08:50.293
we've actually used
this particular explosive,

08:50.295 --> 08:53.563
so I think we might have to do
a little research.

08:53.565 --> 08:54.998
Yeah, let's go to the bomb range,

08:55.000 --> 08:56.766
and we'll ask ourselves four questions.

08:56.768 --> 08:59.602
One, what is it? Two, how does it work?

08:59.604 --> 09:01.070
Three, will a car collision set it off?

09:01.072 --> 09:02.404
And then, four,

09:02.406 --> 09:04.840
will a bigger amount
give us a bigger explosion?

09:04.842 --> 09:06.641
Explosions at the bomb range?

09:06.643 --> 09:08.043
That's my favorite kind of research.

09:09.880 --> 09:11.981
With those four questions

09:11.983 --> 09:14.516
and no small amount of mayhem in mind...

09:15.753 --> 09:18.153
Guns and explosives...
what could be better?

09:18.155 --> 09:20.689
...the MythBusters
rock up to the bomb range,

09:20.691 --> 09:23.659
where it's time
for a little shoot and tell.

09:23.661 --> 09:26.328
This is the Hollywood
binary explosive of the myth.

09:26.330 --> 09:28.998
You've got an oxidizer and a catalyst.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.434
The beauty of this... on their
own, they're virtually inert.

09:32.436 --> 09:33.668
But if you mix them together

09:33.670 --> 09:35.603
and shoot them with a high-powered rifle,

09:35.605 --> 09:37.304
you get a superfast chain reaction

09:37.306 --> 09:39.073
that gives you a really nice explosion.

09:39.075 --> 09:41.408
This is the first time
we've used it on our show,

09:41.410 --> 09:45.379
but it shares many similarities
with other high explosives

09:45.381 --> 09:46.713
that we have used on our show.

09:46.715 --> 09:51.652
Namely, it requires a shock wave
in order to set it off.

09:51.654 --> 09:53.554
A hammer won't do it.

09:53.556 --> 09:55.957
Small handgun fire won't do it.

09:55.959 --> 09:59.761
Even automatic
small-caliber fire won't do it.

09:59.763 --> 10:01.563
You need a high-powered rifle.

10:01.565 --> 10:03.231
And that's what we're gonna use.

10:03.233 --> 10:05.034
And this is the gun.

10:05.036 --> 10:07.637
It's a .308 sniper rifle.

10:07.639 --> 10:10.372
This thing has a muzzle velocity
of 2,500 feet per second.

10:10.374 --> 10:13.609
That's plenty of power
to set off our binary explosive.

10:15.612 --> 10:18.179
Okay. Here we go. Firing.

10:18.181 --> 10:21.415
Now, the plan is, we're gonna
fire into our catalyst.

10:23.852 --> 10:26.987
Okay. Catalyst alone.

10:26.989 --> 10:28.655
No explosion.

10:28.657 --> 10:31.057
And then we're gonna fire
into our oxidizer.

10:35.463 --> 10:38.165
- No explosion.
- Time to mix them.

10:40.169 --> 10:42.537
Then we're gonna mix
the two components together,

10:42.539 --> 10:44.873
fire into that, and see if it explodes.

10:44.875 --> 10:46.175
Now, if it explodes,

10:46.177 --> 10:48.777
that tells us a very important
thing about this myth...

10:48.779 --> 10:52.047
that the chemicals were mixed
in the back of this guy's trunk,

10:52.049 --> 10:54.483
which means that guy was crazy.

10:54.485 --> 10:56.951
All right. This is
the mixed binary explosive.

10:56.953 --> 10:58.652
- You guys ready?
- Ready.

10:58.654 --> 11:00.320
- Did you mix it good?
- Oh, I did.

11:04.425 --> 11:06.059
- Wow!
- That was a good pop.

11:09.863 --> 11:11.564
So, we've come out to the bomb range

11:11.566 --> 11:13.533
to find out
exactly what we're dealing with.

11:13.535 --> 11:15.735
Turns out we're dealing with
something pretty awesome.

11:15.737 --> 11:17.503
You mix it together,

11:17.505 --> 11:19.939
you add a little energy
from a high-powered rifle,

11:19.941 --> 11:22.207
and you get a chemical reaction

11:22.209 --> 11:25.009
that results in a cloud
of rapidly expanding gases,

11:25.011 --> 11:28.045
or as we like to call it, an explosion.

11:28.047 --> 11:29.847
Now, the question is, what's next?

11:29.849 --> 11:31.315
Does more equal more?

11:31.317 --> 11:33.785
If we ramp up
to a trunkful of this stuff,

11:33.787 --> 11:36.020
how much bigger will the explosion be?

11:36.022 --> 11:38.757
That's right. It's bigger boom time.

11:38.759 --> 11:41.693
Next on "MythBusters"...

11:41.695 --> 11:45.330
...the walrus is back
in his not-so-natural habitat.

11:45.332 --> 11:47.265
And later...

11:48.268 --> 11:49.401
...Kari, Grant, and Tory

11:49.403 --> 11:51.537
ramp it up with rockets.

11:56.152 --> 11:58.087
Our myth-busting pedestrians

11:58.089 --> 11:59.388
have already established

11:59.390 --> 12:03.092
that blindfolds
and straight lines don't mix.

12:03.094 --> 12:04.093
Whoa!

12:06.831 --> 12:09.265
But how about other types of travel?

12:09.267 --> 12:10.933
I can't believe
we didn't get pulled over.

12:12.070 --> 12:14.236
We've already established
that when blindfolded,

12:14.238 --> 12:16.239
we were unable to walk
in a straight line.

12:16.241 --> 12:18.607
Now it's time to find out

12:18.609 --> 12:21.543
if we're able to swim in a
straight line while blindfolded.

12:21.545 --> 12:23.145
Each of us will take a turn
putting on a pair

12:23.147 --> 12:24.613
of blacked-out swimming goggles.

12:24.615 --> 12:26.682
Then we'll see if we can swim
a straight line

12:26.684 --> 12:29.251
from here to the reflector
across the lake.

12:29.253 --> 12:31.420
The GPS will tell us how we did.

12:31.422 --> 12:33.856
You know what I like about tests
where I get to wear a wet suit?

12:33.858 --> 12:35.825
Tight material tends to hold me
in a little bit,

12:35.827 --> 12:38.294
make me look a little less tubby.

12:38.296 --> 12:40.429
It's not working, is it?

12:40.431 --> 12:41.497
Oh, crap.

12:41.499 --> 12:43.266
Speaking of body shape...

12:43.268 --> 12:44.734
GPS me.

12:44.736 --> 12:47.103
...is the wonky walking
of the previous test

12:47.105 --> 12:50.506
all about that particular method
of movement?

12:50.508 --> 12:51.841
Whoo! Whoo!

12:51.843 --> 12:53.709
Aw, it's cold.

12:53.711 --> 12:56.078
Will the biomechanics of swimming

12:56.080 --> 13:00.349
keep our out-of-shape swim team
on the straight and narrow?

13:00.351 --> 13:02.651
Well, a mere 30 feet into the test,

13:02.653 --> 13:04.586
it's clear that the blindfold,

13:04.588 --> 13:07.590
by blocking out any visual landmarks,

13:07.592 --> 13:11.094
makes the answer a drifting, dizzying no.

13:11.096 --> 13:13.564
He's swimming around and around
in a corkscrew.

13:13.566 --> 13:15.866
Once again, the really compelling detail

13:15.868 --> 13:18.970
is not how far off course
Adam is straying...

13:18.972 --> 13:20.438
I must be close!

13:20.440 --> 13:23.708
...but that he thinks
he's going straight.

13:23.710 --> 13:25.610
I feel like I'm doing pretty good.

13:25.612 --> 13:28.846
In my mental landscape,
the target's still right there.

13:28.848 --> 13:31.449
No. No, Adam, it isn't.

13:31.451 --> 13:33.718
Let's see if the walrus
can do any better.

13:33.720 --> 13:34.786
I'm ready.

13:34.788 --> 13:36.621
Well, Adam didn't do so well.

13:36.623 --> 13:38.456
Will I be able to do any better?

13:38.458 --> 13:41.959
Without any kind of reference,
I don't see why I would.

13:41.961 --> 13:43.360
Aiming blindfolded

13:43.362 --> 13:45.662
for a target straight across the lake,

13:45.664 --> 13:46.864
two things are clear.

13:46.866 --> 13:49.299
For a marine mammal, he's...

13:49.301 --> 13:52.969
...clearly not at home in the water.

13:52.971 --> 13:55.505
And his pre-test prediction was right...

13:55.507 --> 13:58.207
as well as the occasional left,
followed by a right...

13:59.544 --> 14:00.943
...some more right,

14:00.945 --> 14:02.745
and, well, you get the picture.

14:04.615 --> 14:06.783
Well, Jamie didn't fare
any better than I did

14:06.785 --> 14:08.351
in attempting to swim the straight line.

14:08.353 --> 14:10.387
In fact, he fared far worse.

14:10.389 --> 14:12.156
He did have the intuition in the middle

14:12.158 --> 14:14.258
that things were going horribly awry...

14:14.260 --> 14:16.928
I get the feeling
I'm swimming in a circle.

14:16.930 --> 14:20.232
...whereas I thought I was
heading straight for the target.

14:20.234 --> 14:21.801
Verdict time.

14:21.803 --> 14:23.703
Is it possible to swim in a
straight line while blindfolded?

14:23.705 --> 14:25.437
- No.
- So, what's next?

14:25.439 --> 14:26.439
Driving.

14:26.441 --> 14:28.141
I love it.

14:32.780 --> 14:36.015
Can the impact energy of a fender bender

14:36.017 --> 14:38.251
set off a trunkload of binary explosive...

14:39.388 --> 14:42.322
...and blow a car to smithereens?

14:42.324 --> 14:47.561
Kari, Grant, and Tory are at the
bomb range, aiming to find out.

14:47.563 --> 14:49.863
- Wow!
- That was a good pop.

14:49.865 --> 14:52.299
So, we know from working
with explosives like ANFO

14:52.301 --> 14:55.035
when you use more of it,
you get a bigger boom.

14:55.037 --> 14:56.837
It seems pretty obvious.

14:56.839 --> 14:58.739
But that might not
actually be the case here.

14:58.741 --> 15:01.542
In special effects, they use
really small quantities.

15:01.544 --> 15:03.277
One load is only half a pound.

15:03.279 --> 15:05.746
And, in fact, when it's mixed,
it's really, really stable.

15:05.748 --> 15:08.882
So what we need to know
is if a single bullet

15:08.884 --> 15:10.984
will actually detonate the entire batch

15:10.986 --> 15:12.752
when you're using a very large quantity.

15:12.754 --> 15:13.920
All right.

15:13.922 --> 15:16.323
This is Hollywood binary
explosive double load.

15:16.325 --> 15:17.257
Send it.

15:20.295 --> 15:21.395
Whoa!

15:21.397 --> 15:24.799
Whoa!

15:24.801 --> 15:25.900
Wow.

15:27.302 --> 15:29.371
Now, as you can see
from the destroyed box,

15:29.373 --> 15:31.840
the double material gives
at least double the explosion,

15:31.842 --> 15:33.041
if not more.

15:33.043 --> 15:34.476
But now what we want to see

15:34.478 --> 15:37.113
is if you had multiple cans mixed up,

15:37.115 --> 15:40.183
would hitting one of them
set off a chain reaction,

15:40.185 --> 15:42.586
or would the one that got hit
by a bullet just explode?

15:42.588 --> 15:45.922
So we're gonna mix up five jars
of this stuff, line them up,

15:45.924 --> 15:48.491
take a shot at one,
and see if it sets off the rest.

15:48.493 --> 15:50.326
All right. Here we go.

15:52.829 --> 15:54.063
Wow!

15:54.065 --> 15:55.164
There you go.

15:55.166 --> 15:56.932
That was awesome!

15:56.934 --> 15:58.100
You got a chain reaction.

15:58.102 --> 15:59.501
- They all went off.
- Totally.

15:59.503 --> 16:01.503
I like combining guns and explosives.

16:01.505 --> 16:03.505
- Yeah.
- All right.

16:03.507 --> 16:05.407
When we first started this story,

16:05.409 --> 16:06.708
we had four questions...

16:06.710 --> 16:09.043
what is this explosive, how does it work,

16:09.045 --> 16:12.413
does more equal a bigger boom,
and can a car crash set it off?

16:12.415 --> 16:14.648
Well, we have answers to the first three.

16:14.650 --> 16:16.583
We know what it is, we know how it works,

16:16.585 --> 16:18.886
and we know that one small canister

16:18.888 --> 16:22.023
will detonate a chain reaction
in a much larger batch.

16:23.559 --> 16:26.995
So the big question is,
will a high-energy impact

16:26.997 --> 16:28.696
other than a high-velocity round

16:28.698 --> 16:30.832
be enough to set off
our binary explosive?

16:30.834 --> 16:32.133
That's right.

16:32.135 --> 16:34.669
We are about to see
if we can create an explosion

16:34.671 --> 16:36.137
from a car crash.

16:36.139 --> 16:40.108
Coming up next on "MythBusters",
where did I leave my car?

16:49.628 --> 16:52.564
In the myth
of the exploding fender bender...

16:54.633 --> 16:55.967
...Kari, Grant, and Tory

16:55.969 --> 16:59.203
are having fun
playing with guns and blammo.

17:00.772 --> 17:03.875
All right. So, we know that
our Hollywood binary explosive

17:03.877 --> 17:05.476
needs to be mixed to go off.

17:06.712 --> 17:08.012
We also know that it takes

17:08.013 --> 17:10.247
a high-velocity round to make it explode

17:10.249 --> 17:13.282
and that it can go off
in a chain reaction

17:13.285 --> 17:16.185
even if it's in several
different little containers.

17:18.422 --> 17:20.923
So now we want to see if an impact

17:20.925 --> 17:22.590
will set off those binary explosives,

17:22.593 --> 17:24.025
just like in a car crash.

17:24.027 --> 17:26.761
To dig a big hole, you need a big shovel.

17:26.762 --> 17:28.363
So to replicate the exact conditions

17:28.365 --> 17:30.365
of the mythical scenario,

17:30.367 --> 17:33.301
the team is setting up
for an actual car crash...

17:33.303 --> 17:34.902
Somebody order a car?

17:34.904 --> 17:37.204
...in a controlled environment.

17:37.206 --> 17:40.107
Now, you'll notice we're
not on a road or on a runway.

17:40.109 --> 17:41.875
Turns out it's really hard to find a place

17:41.877 --> 17:44.512
that'll let you crash
a car with explosives.

17:44.514 --> 17:46.014
So this is our answer.

17:46.016 --> 17:48.550
We're going to bury a car halfway deep

17:48.552 --> 17:50.218
so that just the trunk's sticking out,

17:50.220 --> 17:53.322
re-create the crash by dropping
another car at 150 feet

17:53.324 --> 17:55.391
so that it hits at freeway speed

17:55.393 --> 17:59.429
with 50 pounds of binary
explosive in the trunk.

17:59.431 --> 18:01.965
All right. So now
that we have our hole dug,

18:01.967 --> 18:05.035
it's time to put our car
nose down into the hole.

18:06.138 --> 18:08.237
This way, the car won't move at all

18:08.239 --> 18:10.840
when we drop the other car from 150 feet

18:10.842 --> 18:13.441
from the crane into the trunk.

18:13.443 --> 18:15.443
Looks like we caught a big one.

18:16.445 --> 18:17.678
With 50 pounds

18:17.680 --> 18:20.815
of premixed binary explosive
in the trunk...

18:20.817 --> 18:24.785
20 times more than this...

18:24.787 --> 18:26.888
it could well be the end of the road

18:26.890 --> 18:28.590
for our flame-covered friend.

18:28.592 --> 18:29.758
All right. Car's loaded.

18:29.760 --> 18:30.993
Let's drop a car on it.

18:30.995 --> 18:33.162
We're almost doubling the speed,

18:33.164 --> 18:35.698
and the collision
will create 880,000 joules

18:35.700 --> 18:36.666
of kinetic energy.

18:36.668 --> 18:38.000
Yeah.

18:38.002 --> 18:39.702
I still don't think it's gonna explode.

18:39.704 --> 18:41.871
Well, there's only one way to find out...

18:41.873 --> 18:45.809
dropping a car from 150 feet
at 60 miles an hour

18:45.811 --> 18:49.479
and crashing it into another car
that's standing on end

18:49.481 --> 18:53.316
half-buried in the ground
with a trunkful of explosives.

18:53.318 --> 18:54.450
Just another day at the office.

18:54.452 --> 18:57.152
All right. This is freeway speed.

18:57.154 --> 18:59.721
100 loads of binary explosive

18:59.723 --> 19:00.588
in the trunk.

19:00.590 --> 19:01.656
Rear-end collision

19:01.658 --> 19:03.825
in 3, 2, 1.

19:10.900 --> 19:12.134
Direct hit.

19:12.136 --> 19:13.202
That was a great hit.

19:13.204 --> 19:15.138
- No explosion.
- No explosion.

19:15.140 --> 19:16.439
No explosion.

19:19.243 --> 19:20.677
No explosion.

19:20.679 --> 19:24.048
And with the circumstances
of the myth re-created exactly,

19:24.050 --> 19:26.650
albeit at 90 degrees,

19:26.652 --> 19:29.719
the damning conclusion
is quick to follow.

19:29.721 --> 19:33.623
We wanted to create
a crash at freeway speed.

19:33.625 --> 19:34.991
I think we did one better.

19:34.993 --> 19:37.259
Why? Because that car's buried
into the ground.

19:37.261 --> 19:38.560
It had nowhere to go.

19:38.562 --> 19:40.629
That means it absorbed
all the energy of the collision.

19:40.631 --> 19:42.330
Still no explosion.

19:42.332 --> 19:43.565
This myth is busted.

19:43.567 --> 19:45.266
Under normal circumstances,

19:45.268 --> 19:46.634
the myth is busted.

19:46.636 --> 19:48.803
But can the impact from a fender bender

19:48.805 --> 19:52.640
ever initiate an explosion
under any circumstances?

19:52.642 --> 19:57.045
To find out, this story
is getting supersized.

19:57.047 --> 19:58.480
I think we need more speed...

19:58.482 --> 20:00.582
some extreme speed.

20:00.584 --> 20:02.184
Well, we could make a rocket-powered car.

20:02.186 --> 20:04.786
I mean, that would give us a lot of speed.

20:04.788 --> 20:05.954
All right. Road trip.

20:05.956 --> 20:08.790
I hope this works.

20:10.926 --> 20:12.928
Having walked wonky...

20:12.930 --> 20:13.862
Whoa!

20:13.864 --> 20:16.465
...and swum squiggly,

20:16.467 --> 20:19.368
the myth that it's impossible to
stay on the straight and narrow

20:19.370 --> 20:22.471
while blindfolded is looking good.

20:22.473 --> 20:26.074
But our dynamic duo
are covering all of their bases

20:26.076 --> 20:29.310
and taking human locomotion
out of the equation.

20:29.312 --> 20:31.411
Even with the aid of a machine,

20:31.413 --> 20:36.215
can you travel a straight line
while sight-deprived?

20:36.217 --> 20:37.550
Some blindfolded driving.

20:37.552 --> 20:38.651
Should we get to it?

20:38.653 --> 20:39.651
I think so.

20:40.821 --> 20:42.253
This test is really simple.

20:42.255 --> 20:43.388
Once again, we're gonna use

20:43.390 --> 20:45.223
blinders and hearing suppression,

20:45.225 --> 20:48.694
and all we're gonna do
is try and drive a straight line

20:48.696 --> 20:50.962
right towards the city of San Francisco.

20:50.964 --> 20:54.099
So that we can tell where we've been,

20:54.101 --> 20:56.768
we're gonna attach this sports chalker

20:56.770 --> 20:58.470
to the back of our golf cart,

20:58.472 --> 21:00.972
and that line's
gonna tell the whole story.

21:00.974 --> 21:03.575
They'll also be using their trusty GPS unit

21:03.577 --> 21:05.978
to plot their course electronically.

21:05.980 --> 21:08.313
And in this most straightforward of tests,

21:08.315 --> 21:12.384
Adam thinks he's about to bust
the myth by doing just that...

21:12.386 --> 21:13.552
going straight.

21:13.554 --> 21:15.054
I do have a prediction for this test.

21:15.056 --> 21:16.622
I don't think it's going to be very hard

21:16.624 --> 21:17.957
to drive in a straight line.

21:17.959 --> 21:19.325
Go.

21:19.327 --> 21:21.760
I think all I need to do
is align the wheels

21:21.762 --> 21:23.428
and not move my hands.

21:23.430 --> 21:26.365
I'm holding my hands steady,

21:26.367 --> 21:27.600
but I can't shake the feeling

21:27.602 --> 21:30.002
that I'm drifting to the right.

21:30.004 --> 21:31.437
Interesting.

21:31.439 --> 21:34.574
Once again, Adam rejects
straight-line reality...

21:35.844 --> 21:38.579
...in favor of his own internal vision.

21:38.581 --> 21:41.482
Okay. You're gonna have to stop.

21:41.484 --> 21:43.016
Well, you can open your eyes.

21:47.255 --> 21:48.789
I was drifting to the left?

21:48.791 --> 21:50.558
Yeah. Want to try again?

21:50.560 --> 21:53.661
Absolutely.

21:53.663 --> 21:55.663
But two further tests

21:55.665 --> 21:58.598
only confirm the fact
that driving in a straight line

21:58.600 --> 22:01.267
is not as simple as holding
the steering wheel steady.

22:01.269 --> 22:02.702
Oh.

22:02.704 --> 22:04.638
Oh, I feel a terrain change.

22:04.640 --> 22:06.607
I think I'm in trouble.

22:07.609 --> 22:10.645
Any number of small adjustments
and corrections

22:10.647 --> 22:13.115
have to be made to stay the course...

22:13.117 --> 22:14.650
You know, I think the wind

22:14.652 --> 22:17.419
is, like, giving me
a false feeling of turning.

22:17.421 --> 22:18.521
Could be.

22:18.523 --> 22:20.723
Adjustments that are impossible to make,

22:20.725 --> 22:24.127
for Adam at least,
without a visual reference.

22:26.164 --> 22:27.263
Whoa!

22:27.265 --> 22:29.765
I drove us into the middle of a field.

22:29.767 --> 22:33.870
And the GPS data
illustrates that perfectly.

22:33.872 --> 22:35.172
The question is,

22:35.174 --> 22:38.709
can Jamie do any better
on his three test drives?

22:38.711 --> 22:39.209
Go.

22:43.215 --> 22:44.415
Basically, I'm trying to focus

22:44.417 --> 22:47.351
on my internal sense of orientation.

22:47.353 --> 22:50.555
And I have to say, it doesn't
feel like it's very accurate.

22:50.557 --> 22:52.057
Well, that doesn't feel right.

22:52.059 --> 22:56.529
That leaves me with only a very
rough sense of what I'm doing

22:56.531 --> 22:58.732
based on the wind
and the roughness of the road,

22:58.734 --> 23:01.368
which isn't a whole heck of a lot.

23:01.370 --> 23:03.470
Funny. I could be going around in circles

23:03.472 --> 23:04.738
for all I know.

23:04.740 --> 23:08.341
So this doesn't really work
too well, I don't think.

23:08.343 --> 23:09.809
Despite making it

23:09.811 --> 23:11.477
further down the runway than Adam,

23:11.479 --> 23:14.113
Jamie has only given this myth
another kick

23:14.115 --> 23:16.316
in the "confirm" direction.

23:16.318 --> 23:19.152
So far, we've walked, we've swum,

23:19.154 --> 23:20.453
and now we've driven.

23:20.455 --> 23:22.456
I'll admit I thought
we weren't gonna get anything

23:22.458 --> 23:24.291
out of the driving test
in terms of results.

23:24.293 --> 23:26.193
I mean, supposedly you're in this machine

23:26.195 --> 23:29.329
where all you need to do is hold
tight to the steering wheel

23:29.331 --> 23:31.197
and it'll carry you on a straight line.

23:31.199 --> 23:32.899
I'm holding my hands perfectly steady.

23:32.901 --> 23:33.967
What's wrong with me?

23:33.969 --> 23:35.268
But even in that machine,

23:35.270 --> 23:38.304
the kinesthetic feedback
we're getting from the world

23:38.306 --> 23:40.674
forced both Jamie and I
to make corrections.

23:40.676 --> 23:43.176
These corrections were based
on a map of our landscape

23:43.178 --> 23:45.878
we had in our head which wasn't correct,

23:45.880 --> 23:47.948
and thus our corrections were incorrect

23:47.950 --> 23:50.716
and sent us careening
all over the runway.

23:50.718 --> 23:53.787
Even driving, we could not make
a straight line.

23:53.789 --> 23:55.521
It's an interesting anomaly,

23:55.523 --> 23:57.924
and there seems to be no rhyme or reason

23:57.926 --> 23:59.826
as to why we can't do it.

23:59.828 --> 24:03.096
There's no correlation between
left- and right-handedness

24:03.098 --> 24:05.699
or body asymmetry.

24:05.701 --> 24:08.436
It simply appears
that, deprived of our eyesight,

24:08.438 --> 24:10.404
we are physically incapable

24:10.406 --> 24:14.342
of maintaining the unnatural
construct of a straight line.

24:14.344 --> 24:16.411
So the myth is confirmed.

24:16.413 --> 24:19.048
But Adam and Jamie
want to take it further

24:19.050 --> 24:21.951
and explore the real-world implications.

24:29.084 --> 24:31.385
Okay. So, a 60-mile-an-hour crash

24:31.387 --> 24:32.854
is not gonna set it off.

24:32.856 --> 24:34.955
But we can't stop there.

24:34.957 --> 24:36.323
All right. How about this?

24:36.325 --> 24:38.592
How about instead
of a regular fender bender,

24:38.594 --> 24:42.028
it was like a super car crashing
into the back of another car

24:42.030 --> 24:43.963
at, say, a couple hundred miles an hour?

24:43.965 --> 24:46.165
I love it, and I know
exactly where we're gonna go

24:46.167 --> 24:47.666
- to test this.
- Road trip?

24:47.668 --> 24:48.968
Yeah. But just in case,

24:48.970 --> 24:50.669
let's not put the explosive in the trunk.

24:50.671 --> 24:51.870
Good idea.

24:51.872 --> 24:53.872
When ramping it up is on the menu,

24:53.874 --> 24:56.475
there's one location that's guaranteed

24:56.477 --> 24:58.610
to find the dial marked "awesome",

24:58.612 --> 25:02.614
turn it up to 11, rip it off,
and run away laughing.

25:02.616 --> 25:05.083
Perfect day for science.

25:05.085 --> 25:07.018
So, we are back at New Mexico Tech,

25:07.020 --> 25:10.254
one of the most incredible
test facilities in the world.

25:10.256 --> 25:11.322
Why are we here?

25:11.324 --> 25:13.191
Because of their rocket sled.

25:13.193 --> 25:15.794
Last time we were here,
we split a car in half.

25:17.997 --> 25:19.798
With this track, our rocket sled

25:19.800 --> 25:23.335
should be able to accelerate
with 63,000 pounds of thrust

25:23.337 --> 25:27.340
over a quarter-second,
upwards of 300 miles an hour

25:27.342 --> 25:28.541
to create what we hope

25:28.543 --> 25:30.877
is gonna be the world's
fastest car crash.

25:33.514 --> 25:36.081
And this is our target car.

25:36.083 --> 25:39.418
It's completely isolated, as if
it were stopped on the freeway

25:39.420 --> 25:43.688
with 200 loads of mixed binary
explosive in the trunk.

25:43.690 --> 25:46.558
When that rocket-sled car comes
crashing into the back end,

25:46.560 --> 25:49.360
we will find out
once and for all if a collision

25:49.362 --> 25:52.030
has enough energy to create a detonation

25:52.032 --> 25:54.199
and give us a massive explosion.

25:54.201 --> 25:55.867
But before the team

25:55.869 --> 25:58.771
launches a rocket-propelled
fender bender,

25:58.773 --> 26:00.472
a control is required.

26:00.474 --> 26:02.275
Now, you know
it's gonna be a good experiment

26:02.277 --> 26:04.544
when the control test
is a massive explosion.

26:04.546 --> 26:06.446
Knowing just what kind of havoc

26:06.448 --> 26:07.848
the rocket sled can wreak...

26:08.416 --> 26:10.651
Wow!

26:10.653 --> 26:12.853
...detecting whether the binary explosive

26:12.855 --> 26:16.323
has actually detonated
amongst the carnage...

26:16.325 --> 26:18.725
What an impossibly large amount of force.

26:18.727 --> 26:20.293
...may be difficult.

26:20.295 --> 26:22.462
MythBusters version of cocktail.

26:22.464 --> 26:23.863
Shaken, not stirred.

26:23.865 --> 26:25.597
So, to be sure, the team

26:25.599 --> 26:29.835
will set off the same amount of
binary explosive... 200 loads...

26:29.837 --> 26:31.370
in the trunk of this car

26:31.372 --> 26:34.172
and establish a devastation benchmark.

26:34.174 --> 26:36.742
This is the biggest bomb range
at New Mexico Tech.

26:36.744 --> 26:39.912
New Mexico Tech, where you can
get a PHD in blowing $%^@ up.

26:39.914 --> 26:42.215
In fact, it's also
the most robust bunker.

26:42.217 --> 26:46.586
It is built to withstand
20,000 pounds of TNT.

26:46.588 --> 26:48.322
Our explosion's not quite that big,

26:48.324 --> 26:49.724
but it's within the spirit of the myth...

26:49.726 --> 26:51.793
a trunkful of binary explosive.

26:51.795 --> 26:54.261
Okay, so, because this is
potentially so dangerous,

26:54.263 --> 26:57.164
we will be very far away and underground.

26:57.166 --> 26:58.465
Home, sweet home.

26:58.467 --> 27:00.100
So we're gonna do it
the old-fashioned way...

27:00.102 --> 27:01.501
use a detonator.

27:01.503 --> 27:04.237
All right. This is binary car control

27:04.239 --> 27:07.106
filled with 200 loads
of binary explosive.

27:07.108 --> 27:10.676
In 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

27:14.749 --> 27:16.716
Wow! That was a massive explosion.

27:22.688 --> 27:25.257
That was an incredible explosion.

27:25.259 --> 27:27.593
I mean, I had no idea
that this binary explosive

27:27.595 --> 27:29.629
had this much destructive power.

27:29.631 --> 27:32.598
But we know that it took a blasting cap

27:32.600 --> 27:33.900
in order to set this off.

27:36.170 --> 27:40.506
The real question now is, will
a car crash have enough energy

27:40.508 --> 27:42.875
to set this off and do
the same amount of damage?

27:42.877 --> 27:44.710
Well, at least now we have a benchmark.

27:44.712 --> 27:47.113
In the ramped-up rocket-sled crash,

27:47.115 --> 27:50.550
they'll be looking for a shock
wave, followed by a fireball,

27:50.552 --> 27:54.887
and the car roof
being blown 200 feet in the air.

27:54.889 --> 27:57.723
And those are
just the control benchmarks.

27:57.725 --> 28:00.092
With that, it's time to hit the track

28:00.094 --> 28:03.962
and set up for the fender bender
to end all fender benders.

28:03.964 --> 28:05.664
I know this engine doesn't look like much,

28:05.666 --> 28:09.367
but it's gonna be putting out
a million horsepower today.

28:09.369 --> 28:11.035
This is the first time New Mexico Tech

28:11.037 --> 28:13.438
has actually put a car on the rocket sled.

28:13.440 --> 28:15.806
There's a lot of jeopardy here
aerodynamically.

28:15.808 --> 28:18.043
If that car starts to lift off the track,

28:18.045 --> 28:20.345
it's going to pull that rocket
sled off of the track,

28:20.347 --> 28:23.081
trash the experiment and the track.

28:23.083 --> 28:24.716
Hence the concerted team effort

28:24.718 --> 28:26.384
preparing the impact vehicle...

28:26.386 --> 28:29.187
a truck with rockets, as standard.

28:29.189 --> 28:30.455
This is the first time

28:30.457 --> 28:32.190
they are flying a vehicle down the track.

28:32.192 --> 28:33.491
Anything can happen.

28:33.493 --> 28:35.293
But there's one thing

28:35.295 --> 28:37.062
Tory thinks won't happen.

28:37.064 --> 28:38.798
Now, we know a high-powered rifle

28:38.800 --> 28:40.066
will set off the binary explosive,

28:40.068 --> 28:42.535
and that is traveling
at 2,000 feet per second,

28:42.537 --> 28:44.337
which is 1,400 miles an hour.

28:44.339 --> 28:45.806
Wouldn't be a trip without one of those.

28:47.843 --> 28:49.977
Now, our car is only gonna be traveling

28:49.979 --> 28:51.378
at 300 miles an hour,

28:51.380 --> 28:54.014
so I have a hard time
believing that that crash

28:54.016 --> 28:56.817
is gonna be enough
to detonate the explosive.

28:56.819 --> 28:59.720
But we have done
everything we can scientifically

28:59.722 --> 29:00.921
to cover our bases.

29:00.923 --> 29:02.256
Let's see what happens.

29:02.258 --> 29:05.526
With a trunkful of premixed
binary explosives

29:05.528 --> 29:07.495
in the target car...

29:07.497 --> 29:09.630
200 loads.

29:09.632 --> 29:12.199
...all that's left to do is winch the truck

29:12.201 --> 29:15.435
back to the start of the track
and add the rockets.

29:15.437 --> 29:16.803
These are 5-inch H-VAR rockets.

29:16.805 --> 29:19.039
There's gonna be 10 of them on our sled.

29:19.041 --> 29:20.507
Now, they were made in the 1950s,

29:20.509 --> 29:23.377
but, believe me, they still pack a punch.

29:23.379 --> 29:26.147
They're gonna give us
65,000 pounds of thrust

29:26.149 --> 29:27.481
in a quarter of a second

29:27.483 --> 29:30.918
and cause the sled to experience
17 G's of acceleration.

29:30.920 --> 29:33.721
That should be more than enough
to get our truck going.

29:33.723 --> 29:36.491
Next, it's mythbuster versus wild.

29:36.493 --> 29:40.462
Will you really walk in circles
in the woods?

29:40.464 --> 29:41.497
Aw, crap.

29:46.928 --> 29:49.997
So, the blindfold
cleanly removed our ability

29:49.999 --> 29:52.366
to walk, swim, or even drive

29:52.368 --> 29:54.701
in anything remotely
approaching a straight line.

29:54.703 --> 29:56.002
Well, that pretty much means the myth

29:56.004 --> 29:57.203
is confirmed, doesn't it?

29:57.205 --> 29:59.338
Yeah. But there's something
that's still bugging me

29:59.340 --> 30:00.773
- about this story.
- What's that?

30:00.775 --> 30:04.109
Well, under no circumstances
do humans ever actually try

30:04.111 --> 30:06.344
and perambulate while blindfolded.

30:06.346 --> 30:08.212
Where's the real-world application?

30:08.214 --> 30:09.380
What do you have in mind?

30:09.382 --> 30:11.582
I'm thinking that if humans

30:11.584 --> 30:13.184
are supposed to get lost in the woods

30:13.186 --> 30:15.386
and that they supposedly walk in circles,

30:15.388 --> 30:17.688
let's you and me head out to the woods

30:17.690 --> 30:20.591
and see if we can get lost
and end up walking in circles.

30:20.593 --> 30:22.894
- It's a plan.
- Excellent.

30:22.896 --> 30:25.663
It's widely reported
that unprepared walkers

30:25.665 --> 30:29.167
lost in the woods
unwittingly wander in circles.

30:29.169 --> 30:32.036
With no clear view of their destination

30:32.038 --> 30:33.671
or established landmarks,

30:33.673 --> 30:37.441
it's as if they were blindfolded.

30:37.443 --> 30:39.810
It's a potential life-saving story

30:39.812 --> 30:42.279
Adam and Jamie can't resist tackling.

30:43.616 --> 30:46.984
Behold the Hyneman
in his natural habitat.

30:48.387 --> 30:51.155
On a clear day in unknown territory,

30:51.157 --> 30:53.558
unable to see their direction
for the trees,

30:53.560 --> 30:56.328
can they stick to a preselected bearing?

30:56.330 --> 30:59.665
Jamie and I are each going
to choose a specific trajectory

30:59.667 --> 31:03.035
and try and walk a straight line
on that trajectory

31:03.037 --> 31:05.371
while being tracked by a GPS.

31:05.373 --> 31:08.774
In 3, 2, 1.

31:08.776 --> 31:10.842
Here we go.

31:10.844 --> 31:13.445
After 30 minutes,
we're gonna come back home

31:13.447 --> 31:14.779
and see exactly how we did.

31:14.781 --> 31:16.147
Now, I'm not talking

31:16.149 --> 31:18.182
walking a straight line like a ruler.

31:18.184 --> 31:21.418
I'm talking I have someplace
I need to get to,

31:21.420 --> 31:24.454
and I want to go there directly.

31:24.456 --> 31:26.089
I'm gonna be doing several things

31:26.091 --> 31:27.623
to keep me walking in a straight line.

31:27.625 --> 31:31.461
I'm gonna try and take sightings
off of trees or other landmarks,

31:31.463 --> 31:34.398
and I'm gonna note my position
relative to the sun.

31:34.400 --> 31:37.568
Right now the sun is directly
overhead and off to my left,

31:37.570 --> 31:40.538
and so if I want to use that
to orient myself

31:40.540 --> 31:42.274
as I'm walking through the forest,

31:42.276 --> 31:45.778
all I have to do is keep it
in approximately that position.

31:45.780 --> 31:49.214
Of course, as time passes,
it's gonna move through the sky,

31:49.216 --> 31:53.685
but I can still keep it kind of
on that one side fairly easily

31:53.687 --> 31:54.853
to compensate for it,

31:54.855 --> 31:58.556
and that'll make sure
I don't walk in circles.

31:59.860 --> 32:01.092
Oh!

32:01.094 --> 32:03.228
That's the time. Time to go home.

32:03.230 --> 32:05.497
Using their trusty GPS units,

32:05.499 --> 32:08.666
they head back to position one,
where the results are in.

32:08.668 --> 32:12.937
Despite terrain obstacles and
obscured long-range visibility,

32:12.939 --> 32:15.206
Jamie, using a range of techniques,

32:15.208 --> 32:17.675
maintained a very accurate trajectory,

32:17.677 --> 32:21.011
and even Adam generally headed
in the right direction.

32:21.013 --> 32:23.247
Using the sun to get his bearings,

32:23.249 --> 32:28.286
he clearly avoided the
corkscrewing the myth implies.

32:28.288 --> 32:30.188
While I might not have
the survival training

32:30.190 --> 32:31.489
that Jamie has,

32:31.491 --> 32:33.325
my techniques actually worked pretty good.

32:33.327 --> 32:35.027
With the help
of a gorgeous day and the sun,

32:35.029 --> 32:37.663
I was able to maintain a
reasonably straight trajectory.

32:37.665 --> 32:39.299
But for the next test,

32:39.301 --> 32:42.001
they're gonna make things
tougher and turn off the sun.

32:42.003 --> 32:44.438
We have to replicate a situation

32:44.440 --> 32:46.539
that is less than optimal
as far as navigating.

32:46.541 --> 32:49.442
Maybe it's a snowstorm,
or maybe it's at night,

32:49.444 --> 32:51.077
and all you've got is a flashlight.

32:51.079 --> 32:53.379
One way or another, you can only see

32:53.381 --> 32:55.647
in the immediate vicinity
right next to you.

32:55.649 --> 32:58.216
Now, I tried a number of different things

32:58.218 --> 32:59.551
back at the shop

32:59.553 --> 33:02.220
to see if I could re-create
that kind of situation.

33:05.591 --> 33:07.058
Definitely not.

33:07.060 --> 33:10.962
And it turns out
the perfect artificial snowstorm,

33:10.964 --> 33:13.665
used by experts to train
for whiteout conditions,

33:13.667 --> 33:17.336
where your vision is restricted
to a radius of just a few feet,

33:17.338 --> 33:18.504
is the bucket head.

33:20.742 --> 33:22.275
Okay. Here we go.

33:22.277 --> 33:25.947
As before, Adam and Jamie
have a preselected bearing.

33:25.949 --> 33:27.281
They can see their feet

33:27.283 --> 33:28.916
and a limited distance in front of them.

33:28.918 --> 33:30.017
Aw, crap.

33:30.019 --> 33:31.285
But crucially,

33:31.287 --> 33:32.487
they can't see the sun

33:32.489 --> 33:34.956
- or use long-range sight markers.
- Ow.

33:34.958 --> 33:39.260
But our expert outdoorsmen
has his technique down pat.

33:39.262 --> 33:41.662
By methodically pacing at right angles

33:41.664 --> 33:43.698
around direct obstacles...

33:43.700 --> 33:45.466
Forward.

33:45.468 --> 33:48.469
...he maintains his
straight-line trajectory.

33:48.471 --> 33:51.906
And go forward again.

33:51.908 --> 33:53.174
While Jamie

33:53.176 --> 33:55.610
robotically paces towards his goal,

33:55.612 --> 33:59.180
the extreme conditions get
the better of untrained Adam...

33:59.182 --> 34:02.818
Something tells me that things
have gone horribly wrong.

34:02.820 --> 34:04.786
...until he's simply wandering in the woods

34:04.788 --> 34:06.989
with a bucket on his head.

34:06.991 --> 34:08.657
With the test complete,

34:08.659 --> 34:11.525
the GPS results show that urbanite Adam

34:11.527 --> 34:15.362
beautifully illustrated just how
important survival training is

34:15.364 --> 34:17.799
in extreme conditions.

34:17.801 --> 34:18.933
Look at that!

34:18.935 --> 34:21.735
I almost drew an ampersand in the woods.

34:21.737 --> 34:24.705
In contrast, Jamie's route was indicative

34:24.706 --> 34:27.675
of his practical approach and technique.

34:27.677 --> 34:29.710
I think we've learned
an important lesson here.

34:29.712 --> 34:31.446
You don't have to obliterate
someone's vision.

34:31.447 --> 34:33.013
You can just merely restrict it,

34:33.014 --> 34:35.817
and all of a sudden, they
might start walking in circles.

34:35.819 --> 34:37.985
Right. But with proper training,

34:37.987 --> 34:40.821
you can still walk in
a straight line and to safety.

34:40.822 --> 34:42.089
Thanks, Jamie.

34:42.091 --> 34:43.757
Yep. While lost in the woods,

34:43.760 --> 34:45.659
as long as you can see the sun,

34:45.661 --> 34:47.527
anyone can walk in a straight line.

34:47.530 --> 34:49.697
However, with limited visibility,

34:49.699 --> 34:52.433
you'll need training
and a disciplined approach.

34:52.435 --> 34:55.637
But is there another option
for a successful escape?

34:55.639 --> 34:57.439
What about teamwork?

34:57.441 --> 34:59.107
- Let's get out of here.
- I'll navigate.

34:59.109 --> 35:00.708
All right.

35:00.710 --> 35:03.411
Coming up, there's a blastoff...

35:04.647 --> 35:05.747
...and a dance-off.

35:05.749 --> 35:06.916
Watch. I can make Jamie dance.

35:15.130 --> 35:17.398
One way or another, it seems that humans

35:17.400 --> 35:19.033
are not inclined to walk in a straight line

35:19.035 --> 35:20.334
if they can't see very well.

35:20.336 --> 35:21.935
Makes me wonder, though,

35:21.937 --> 35:24.971
if there's not some kind
of mechanical solution.

35:26.908 --> 35:29.809
This I've got to see.

35:29.811 --> 35:31.711
All episode long, Adam and I

35:31.713 --> 35:34.013
have been trying to travel
in a straight line...

35:34.015 --> 35:35.749
I'm holding my hands perfectly steady.

35:35.751 --> 35:37.184
What's wrong with me?

35:37.186 --> 35:39.520
...without very much success, I must say.

35:39.522 --> 35:41.889
He's swimming around and around
in a corkscrew.

35:41.891 --> 35:44.025
But now we've had an idea

35:44.027 --> 35:46.528
that may just be the solution
to our problem.

35:46.530 --> 35:48.497
And we're not exactly sure,
but the problem seems to be

35:48.499 --> 35:50.132
that lacking any stimulus,

35:50.134 --> 35:52.968
the human mind creates
a landscape for itself...

35:52.970 --> 35:55.438
Can't shake the feeling
that I'm drifting to the right.

35:55.440 --> 35:57.140
...that's not exactly correct

35:57.142 --> 35:59.376
and then makes corrections
based on that landscape

35:59.378 --> 36:02.246
that lead it very far astray
very, very quickly.

36:02.248 --> 36:04.882
So we thought what if a device
could be created

36:04.884 --> 36:06.884
that would allow two people
working in tandem

36:06.886 --> 36:09.219
to directly, physically feel

36:09.221 --> 36:11.521
when they were being led
off of a straight line?

36:11.523 --> 36:13.323
That's when we came up with this.

36:14.358 --> 36:16.559
By securing themselves into each end

36:16.561 --> 36:18.294
of a rigid, straight-line tether,

36:18.296 --> 36:21.831
the theory is physical feedback
from the hip harnesses

36:21.833 --> 36:26.035
will alert them if they wander
off the straight and narrow.

36:26.037 --> 36:27.636
Watch. I can make Jamie dance.

36:27.638 --> 36:30.673
The fatal flaw for our blindfoldees

36:30.675 --> 36:33.775
could be the high degree
of teamwork required.

36:33.777 --> 36:35.043
That's enough of that.

36:35.045 --> 36:39.214
With their simple
"A"-to-arrow course set up,

36:39.216 --> 36:41.282
it's time to turn out the lights.

36:41.284 --> 36:43.652
I got my goggles. Here we go.

36:43.654 --> 36:45.921
And 3, 2, 1.

36:45.923 --> 36:47.122
Let's go.

36:47.124 --> 36:48.190
They're off.

36:48.192 --> 36:50.426
And the early signs are encouraging.

36:50.428 --> 36:53.662
- I feel like we're walking in a nice,
straight line. - Okay.

36:53.664 --> 36:55.531
Unlike Jamie's solo efforts,

36:55.533 --> 36:57.566
when he veered off course very early,

36:57.568 --> 36:59.502
our pair of perambulators

36:59.504 --> 37:02.005
look like they've got
this conundrum cracked.

37:02.007 --> 37:03.773
Now I know what it really is like

37:03.775 --> 37:04.975
to have a monkey on your back.

37:06.178 --> 37:09.513
But it's not long
before their internal reality

37:09.515 --> 37:11.248
conflicts with the real one,

37:11.250 --> 37:13.150
and they steer off course.

37:13.152 --> 37:14.584
In my mental landscape,

37:14.586 --> 37:16.553
we're traveling slightly
to the right of the arrow.

37:16.555 --> 37:18.188
Feels like we're doing okay.

37:18.190 --> 37:20.323
I feel like you're leaning
a little to the right.

37:20.325 --> 37:21.925
Our device's whole point

37:21.927 --> 37:25.529
was to try and add a kinesthetic
sense to the human body

37:25.531 --> 37:28.431
that it was moving
off of a straight line.

37:28.433 --> 37:30.400
And I honestly felt

37:30.402 --> 37:33.536
like we were maybe
slightly veering off course,

37:33.538 --> 37:36.039
but we walked a complete horseshoe,

37:36.041 --> 37:37.941
and not once did I have the sense

37:37.943 --> 37:39.943
that we were making a tight turn.

37:39.945 --> 37:41.311
Just didn't work.

37:44.149 --> 37:46.450
We're facing where we started.

37:46.452 --> 37:48.051
That's amazing.

37:48.053 --> 37:49.886
The arrow's way over there!

37:53.191 --> 37:54.758
This didn't work at all.

37:54.760 --> 37:57.060
Well, what are you gonna do?
That's science.

37:57.062 --> 37:59.196
You come up with a theory. You test it.

37:59.198 --> 38:00.530
Either it works, or it doesn't.

38:00.532 --> 38:03.200
And in this case, it didn't.

38:03.202 --> 38:05.936
Are we ready?

38:05.938 --> 38:07.904
Yes. We're ready.

38:07.906 --> 38:09.072
Right.

38:09.074 --> 38:11.341
Well, it would seem that all of our tests

38:11.343 --> 38:14.111
have definitively shown that human beings

38:14.113 --> 38:17.314
tend to lack the ability to walk
in a straight line.

38:17.316 --> 38:19.850
Now, what we haven't attempted
to figure out

38:19.852 --> 38:23.019
is the why of that phenomenon.

38:23.021 --> 38:26.456
But I think it's safe to say
that it's confirmed.

38:28.493 --> 38:30.060
Are you there?

38:30.062 --> 38:31.061
I'm right here.

38:31.063 --> 38:33.530
It's totally confirmed. I agree.

38:43.305 --> 38:46.207
That's what the detonation of a trunkful

38:46.209 --> 38:49.643
of Hollywood binary explosive looks like.

38:49.645 --> 38:51.545
Love a good explosion in the morning.

38:51.547 --> 38:54.748
Question is, can the impact
from a fender bender

38:54.750 --> 38:57.484
initiate that explosion?

38:57.486 --> 38:59.420
All right. Ready for launch.

38:59.422 --> 39:02.022
If a rocket-propelled truck can't do it,

39:02.024 --> 39:04.792
no conceivable car crash ever could,

39:04.794 --> 39:07.061
because at 300 miles an hour,

39:07.063 --> 39:12.234
we're exceeding the speed of the
fastest super car on the road.

39:12.236 --> 39:15.070
This is binary explosive
versus the rocket sled.

39:15.072 --> 39:17.506
It's this myth's final chance...

39:17.508 --> 39:18.508
Here we go.

39:18.510 --> 39:20.610
...and final countdown.

39:20.612 --> 39:23.280
In 5...4...

39:23.282 --> 39:28.486
3...2...1...

39:32.725 --> 39:34.325
Oh, my God. What just happened?

39:34.327 --> 39:36.059
I don't know.

39:36.061 --> 39:41.264
What just happened was
an old, beat-up pickup truck...

39:43.166 --> 39:47.135
...powered by 10 H-VAR rockets,

39:47.137 --> 39:50.138
pumping out 65,000 pounds of thrust,

39:50.140 --> 39:54.509
pulled 17 G's

39:54.511 --> 39:57.746
and got up to almost 300 miles an hour.

40:00.684 --> 40:01.917
Oh, my God. That was awesome.

40:01.919 --> 40:03.585
Wow!

40:03.587 --> 40:05.855
As fender benders go,

40:05.857 --> 40:09.659
that was at the end of the scale
marked "insane".

40:09.661 --> 40:12.929
But to find out
whether the binary explosive

40:12.931 --> 40:16.166
in the trunk of the target car
was detonated,

40:16.168 --> 40:17.968
the team needs to get a closer look

40:17.970 --> 40:21.071
and compare it to the control blast.

40:21.073 --> 40:23.974
We watched 200 loads
of binary explosive detonate

40:23.976 --> 40:26.175
so that we could compare it
to what we just witnessed.

40:26.177 --> 40:27.577
We saw a rocket sled

40:27.579 --> 40:30.046
come down the track
at almost 300 miles an hour

40:30.048 --> 40:32.181
and crash into the back end of a car

40:32.183 --> 40:35.017
with the same amount of explosive.

40:35.019 --> 40:38.320
Now, though a spectacular sight,

40:38.322 --> 40:40.389
it was not a detonation.

40:40.391 --> 40:44.060
What we saw with our explosion
was a flash of fire.

40:44.062 --> 40:48.196
What we saw here was a disintegration.

40:48.198 --> 40:51.866
Anybody get the license plate
on that car?

40:51.868 --> 40:53.735
Now, we know that our binary explosive

40:53.737 --> 40:56.104
can be set off
by a high-powered rifle round.

40:58.007 --> 41:00.108
But this myth is about a collision,

41:00.110 --> 41:02.610
specifically a vehicle collision.

41:02.612 --> 41:04.412
We continued to ramp up our speeds

41:04.414 --> 41:07.715
all the way up
to nearly 300 miles per hour,

41:07.717 --> 41:10.185
and still no detonation.

41:10.187 --> 41:11.886
As incredible as it seems,

41:11.888 --> 41:14.690
the energy that could cause
this type of damage

41:14.692 --> 41:18.994
was still not enough
to initiate the explosion.

41:18.996 --> 41:22.532
And that's the beauty
of binary explosives.

41:22.534 --> 41:25.168
Safety-conscious
Hollywood special-effects teams

41:25.170 --> 41:29.073
can rely on a very specific
detonation fingerprint

41:29.075 --> 41:31.575
and know that any incidental impact

41:31.577 --> 41:34.679
will not have disastrous consequences...

41:36.381 --> 41:38.916
...which leaves just one conclusion.

41:38.918 --> 41:42.019
- Wow.
- That was incredible.

41:42.021 --> 41:44.689
I don't think this myth
can be any more busted.

41:44.691 --> 41:46.524
Now, <i>that</i> was a high-speed crash.

41:46.526 --> 41:47.759
Yeah. And you know what?

41:47.761 --> 41:49.360
You're not gonna see a crash
like that on the road.

41:49.362 --> 41:51.429
And even if you did,
there'd be no explosion!

41:51.431 --> 41:53.198
Definitely not a detonation.

41:53.200 --> 41:55.734
All right. So a collision from a car

41:55.736 --> 41:58.837
is never gonna set off
a trunkful of binary explosives.

41:58.839 --> 42:00.105
This one is busted.

42:00.107 --> 42:01.539
- Busted.
- Busted.

42:01.564 --> 42:02.664
That was awesome.
