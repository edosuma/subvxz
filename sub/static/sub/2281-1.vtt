00:31.070 --> 00:33.124
Teela, my child.

00:33.424 --> 00:37.699
You must take this stone to
the Paladin at Sung Hill.

00:37.700 --> 00:40.246
I am too old to make the journey.

00:40.247 --> 00:42.742
Run! Run!

00:55.716 --> 00:57.514
Teela! Teela!

01:13.490 --> 01:16.770
Where... is the stone?

01:16.770 --> 01:18.742
You will never find it!

02:18.572 --> 02:21.629
Run, Teela! The Goddess will not let me die.

02:21.630 --> 02:23.122
Find help.

03:35.020 --> 03:37.010
We shouldn't doing this.

03:38.610 --> 03:40.010
Nonsense.

03:56.202 --> 04:00.260
Gentle... or we'll go... pooh!

04:11.608 --> 04:13.102
- This-this one here?
- Mm-hm.

04:13.102 --> 04:15.693
- OK.
 - Softly!

04:15.694 --> 04:17.386
- I can't!
- Pour.

04:24.560 --> 04:29.229
- Nothing's happening. We should stop.
- Ah-ah... and I would pour the rest in.

04:31.552 --> 04:32.752
Oh!

04:37.190 --> 04:38.402
Now, begin!

04:39.402 --> 04:40.890
Ah, that's it.

05:13.482 --> 05:15.430
I don't know what went wrong.

05:16.630 --> 05:18.339
I think I need more Basilisk blood.

05:18.340 --> 05:19.667
No!

05:20.168 --> 05:21.862
What's that smell?!

05:22.458 --> 05:23.852
Take care of this.

05:23.902 --> 05:25.941
You brought some down there, boy?

05:25.942 --> 05:28.130
I'll strip your hide from you!

05:37.894 --> 05:41.019
Out of my way, gimp!

05:41.020 --> 05:43.205
You clumsy bitch!

05:43.205 --> 05:46.090
You're not worth the gruel it costs to feed you!

05:47.090 --> 05:49.661
Leave that! Let the gimp finish it.

05:50.662 --> 05:52.160
Here!

05:52.560 --> 05:54.250
Take this into town.

05:54.250 --> 05:56.140
Get coin, from the wizard

05:56.840 --> 05:59.370
And I want you back before first watch!

05:59.370 --> 06:01.410
I don't want any trouble with the guards.

06:14.282 --> 06:16.599
- I'll go.
- No, your leg...

06:16.600 --> 06:20.780
You won't get back before dark. They'll catch
you and... they'll brand you as a runaway.

07:20.599 --> 07:23.553
I mastered the vision spell you gave me.

07:24.053 --> 07:28.015
Although, I-I think it could've...
used some more Basilisk blood.

07:29.016 --> 07:31.620
And what the Basilisk blood project?

07:33.120 --> 07:34.889
An eagle.

07:34.890 --> 07:38.700
That's fascinating. I'm certain Basilisk
blood would result in a fireball.

07:44.770 --> 07:46.629
Think I'm ready for more spells.

07:46.630 --> 07:48.540
Really? What kind of spells?

07:50.820 --> 07:52.320
Healing.

07:55.385 --> 07:58.059
I'm not a holy man.

07:58.060 --> 08:00.809
You need a healer.

08:00.810 --> 08:05.210
Magic... is not an art of
faith, but of understanding.

08:08.090 --> 08:12.010
However... I do have something for you.

08:12.310 --> 08:14.110
Bring me that pile of parchment.

08:24.300 --> 08:26.239
There, a displacement spell.

08:26.240 --> 08:29.599
It's very useful, but don't
use it on living objects.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.249
Why not?

08:31.250 --> 08:33.470
Because it will most likely cease to be living.

08:33.471 --> 08:35.280
What are you doing?

08:35.280 --> 08:39.039
I'm leaving. These things
not safe to be left here.

08:39.039 --> 08:41.879
Nothing, is safe here anymore.

08:42.880 --> 08:44.239
You're leaving?

08:44.240 --> 08:48.649
There's too many eyes, too much... lust for power.
I've stayed too long.

08:48.710 --> 08:50.659
Take me with you.

08:50.660 --> 08:53.969
You've a strong mind Marek...
and a gift for learning.

08:53.970 --> 08:55.489
You could teach me.

08:55.490 --> 08:57.629
You could buy me and you could teach me.

09:00.020 --> 09:01.669
There's an inn...

09:01.670 --> 09:03.720
It's just outside of town.

09:06.310 --> 09:08.341
You ask for Hammerhead.

09:08.341 --> 09:10.600
You'll find the experience that you lack, there

09:10.601 --> 09:13.435
and someone... will be in need of a conjurer.

09:16.500 --> 09:17.900
I can't.

09:20.320 --> 09:23.305
I'd be alone... a runaway.

09:23.306 --> 09:25.799
Hunted down and hanged.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.879
You're a fighter, Marek.

09:29.880 --> 09:32.179
It would be a shame to see that flame go out.

09:32.180 --> 09:36.983
- But, I ca...
- No. It's getting dark and you must go.

09:37.040 --> 09:38.840
It's almost night.

09:40.400 --> 09:43.569
Here, it's for the hogs' room.

09:43.570 --> 09:45.339
Please don't go.

09:45.740 --> 09:47.469
You're my only friend.

09:47.470 --> 09:49.444
The only one who could help me.

09:51.930 --> 09:55.169
Good friends aren't so hard to find.

09:56.370 --> 09:58.000
Our paths will cross again.

10:00.710 --> 10:02.900
Now... haste.

10:02.900 --> 10:07.669
It's after first watch and the guards
will looking for slaves breaking curfew.

10:25.268 --> 10:28.544
- What is it?
- Adventurers, they have dragon heads.

10:37.330 --> 10:38.718
The first watch!

10:53.151 --> 10:55.640
Watch where you're going, gimp!

10:57.089 --> 10:59.089
Ohh... ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.

10:59.110 --> 11:02.110
What do we think of this, huh?

11:06.605 --> 11:10.639
Oh, slave girl , huh? But you're not so young.

11:11.440 --> 11:13.915
I could sell you as a 15 year old. Mmm...

11:13.936 --> 11:16.410
- 16 years old, no right leg?
- No! No!

11:16.471 --> 11:19.439
But it's your twisted foot... it's not my type.

11:19.440 --> 11:24.460
But some man, mmm, some man
may pay extra for a girl like you.

11:24.480 --> 11:25.780
No!

11:26.560 --> 11:29.190
Take her to the den. Take her!

11:30.310 --> 11:31.559
No! No.

11:31.560 --> 11:36.120
- Let go! Let go! Let go!
- Ohh!

11:36.300 --> 11:40.249
And find out who owns the rights, in case...
somebody wants to claim her.

11:44.015 --> 11:45.315
Hold!

11:50.720 --> 11:53.822
My slave, she ran away... but I caught her.

11:53.823 --> 11:56.215
No! He's lying!

11:56.815 --> 12:01.182
Your slave's out past first watch.
She'll have to come with me.

12:01.453 --> 12:05.846
Like, I said... my slave girl ran away...

12:05.846 --> 12:07.860
and I found her.

12:09.260 --> 12:11.155
There's no harm done here.

12:18.360 --> 12:20.300
That's for your troubles.

12:20.700 --> 12:22.200
What's her name?

12:29.890 --> 12:31.226
Kill him!

12:59.694 --> 13:02.070
Ah, you... bitch!

13:12.160 --> 13:14.003
I will find you!

13:21.660 --> 13:26.430
You, uh... you just don't know who I am, do you?

13:28.950 --> 13:30.890
I have a general idea.

13:34.900 --> 13:36.920
If you cross me, you will pay!

14:35.284 --> 14:38.108
You thrust this in with some force, my lady.

14:38.108 --> 14:41.144
The effect... was nearly disastrous.

14:42.585 --> 14:44.054
Papers!

14:45.754 --> 14:48.070
- What are you carrying?
- Nae but straw.

14:59.670 --> 15:01.370
Move along. Move along.

15:06.760 --> 15:08.716
Get off me!

15:08.716 --> 15:11.161
A thousand pardons, my lady.

15:11.161 --> 15:12.628
I can't help myself.

15:12.628 --> 15:16.840
Beautiful girl... intimate moment in the straw...

15:18.340 --> 15:21.190
But, alas, work calls.

15:21.190 --> 15:24.024
The magistrate isn't going to
cuckhold himself, now, is he?

15:24.024 --> 15:25.678
Pleasant travels.

15:31.780 --> 15:35.380
- The coins...
- <i>Hey, stop! You there, stop!</i>

15:37.175 --> 15:38.375
<i>Hey!</i>

15:45.280 --> 15:46.880
Oh, no! No! No!

16:25.580 --> 16:27.175
Who's the man here?

16:30.370 --> 16:32.750
Does this belong to you?

16:34.450 --> 16:35.750
Yes.

16:37.630 --> 16:39.640
I trust this can be forgotten!

16:54.370 --> 16:57.273
You led the Vitalian Guard to this house?!

16:57.674 --> 16:59.289
Where's my coin?

16:59.290 --> 17:01.739
I'm sorry, I was robbed, and...

17:04.540 --> 17:07.229
Are you trying to make a fool of me, girl?

17:09.230 --> 17:11.579
You managed that, yourself.

17:14.520 --> 17:16.089
You're finished here!

17:16.089 --> 17:20.109
Yes, I wanted you clean, so I
could keep your price up!

17:20.109 --> 17:26.549
Now, I'll just take what's mine! Sell
whatever's left of you... to the whorehouse!

19:09.470 --> 19:11.069
What was that?

19:12.670 --> 19:16.839
- I... I don't mean...
- You used no powders and you said no words.

19:16.910 --> 19:20.431
It-it was like no magic I've ever seen before.

19:21.600 --> 19:24.731
<i>- Where is she?
- Witch! Conjurer!</i>

19:27.736 --> 19:30.263
I have to go. I'm going to Hammerhead's inn.

19:30.264 --> 19:34.076
Come with me. I can't do it alone, Egan.

19:34.104 --> 19:35.476
Wait.

19:42.010 --> 19:44.952
I made it. It'll help you run.

19:46.360 --> 19:49.670
I don't have your courage.
I-I would never make it.

19:52.070 --> 19:53.890
Come on, go. Quick.

19:57.530 --> 19:58.993
Goodbye, Egan.

19:58.994 --> 20:00.194
Go.

20:13.738 --> 20:15.828
Make sure she stays out.

23:37.350 --> 23:39.780
I won't be sayin' it again!

23:39.780 --> 23:42.290
No fightin' blades in the establishment!

23:50.274 --> 23:52.769
Feed that mess to the pigs.

24:21.340 --> 24:25.856
A round of drinks for the Blood Clan!
On the house!

24:34.084 --> 24:35.349
Hammerhead!

24:35.350 --> 24:37.424
Move it along, nowl!

24:38.425 --> 24:39.925
Hammerhead!

24:42.260 --> 24:44.260
I'm going to assume that you're new here

24:44.260 --> 24:48.020
and that this is a gift... so that Orc over there

24:48.020 --> 24:51.380
doesn't have to polish the blood
off the blade of my ax, again.

24:51.380 --> 24:55.569
- I'm looking for work.
- Then talk to Narnie, over there.

24:55.570 --> 24:57.960
No... adventuring work!

24:57.960 --> 25:01.079
I want a chance at a bounty. I do magic.

25:01.080 --> 25:02.259
Ohhh!

25:02.280 --> 25:05.410
Why didn't you say so? A magician!

25:06.110 --> 25:08.840
Well! I had no idea!

25:08.840 --> 25:14.452
And all this time I've been payin'
court to a real fyekin' magician!

25:14.453 --> 25:17.534
- Now get out before my temper's...
- Ahh!

25:20.807 --> 25:24.830
In the name of the goddess, Anisette,
I demand audience with Orin Tuck!

25:31.060 --> 25:36.359
- Fyekin' women tonight!
- You are Orin Tuck?

25:36.360 --> 25:38.600
Hammerhead's what they be callin' me now.

25:38.610 --> 25:43.159
I am Teela, of the order of
Anisette, sent to plead your help.

25:43.160 --> 25:45.530
Orcs raided my temple, two nights past

25:45.530 --> 25:49.220
and my people were slain, or taken by foul beasts.

25:49.220 --> 25:51.749
I seek heroes to win their freedom.

25:51.750 --> 25:53.729
Have you any gold?

25:55.130 --> 25:59.599
I... have some. 200 silver.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.839
That's not gold.

26:01.840 --> 26:06.689
Please, you and your kind were friends
to the order, in times of old.

26:07.290 --> 26:09.444
Times of old are olden times, now.

26:09.445 --> 26:12.700
And those heroes lie shriveled, in the dirt.

26:12.700 --> 26:14.049
I've no use for causes!

26:14.050 --> 26:16.164
And neither does any man here, today.

26:16.165 --> 26:18.273
They have my sister!

26:18.274 --> 26:23.139
Does any lad here want to
help save this lass's sister,

26:23.140 --> 26:26.599
who was kidnapped by a band or marauding Orcs?

26:26.600 --> 26:30.757
The pay is 200 silver pieces.

26:38.110 --> 26:39.819
There's the door.

26:39.820 --> 26:41.660
I suggest you use it.

26:51.030 --> 26:55.099
If I just fyekin' saw who I think I fyekin' saw...

26:55.100 --> 26:58.329
she better be here to sell herself as a whore!

26:59.330 --> 27:01.170
I will take that bounty!

27:07.060 --> 27:09.490
I'm forming a team.

27:09.490 --> 27:11.439
Any of you are welcome to join my team.

27:11.440 --> 27:14.820
I... bring the skill... of magic.

27:18.390 --> 27:21.423
<i>Careful, she has magic!</i>

27:25.976 --> 27:27.339
Wait!

27:28.940 --> 27:30.749
You need help.

27:31.150 --> 27:34.169
In there... I-I heard you. You nee...
you need help.

27:34.170 --> 27:40.439
I require seasoned adventurers... heroes, even.
Not young girls.

27:40.440 --> 27:42.040
I have a team!

27:43.740 --> 27:45.600
You have a limp.

27:45.950 --> 27:48.609
No one else will help you.

27:48.610 --> 27:50.199
Hammerhead said it.

27:50.200 --> 27:54.839
The mission is too dangerous and...
you have too little to pay.

27:55.240 --> 27:59.293
And you... you do not fear it?

28:00.594 --> 28:02.579
No.

28:02.780 --> 28:05.620
- Should I?
- Yes.

28:19.980 --> 28:25.499
200 silver pieces... full sum upon completion.

28:25.500 --> 28:27.489
It will be dangerous.

28:27.490 --> 28:29.689
But with a care, a man just might survive it.

28:29.690 --> 28:32.343
You won't regret it.

28:32.344 --> 28:35.829
- I very much doubt that.
- Give me until fourth watch.

28:35.830 --> 28:38.410
We meet at the stone circle, at dawn.

29:12.520 --> 29:13.626
I know you.

29:13.926 --> 29:17.183
You're that slave girl that
got me thrown into this cage.

29:17.184 --> 29:18.584
Marek.

29:22.130 --> 29:25.449
That pimp has some influential
friends in my regiment.

29:25.450 --> 29:27.099
I'm here to free you.

29:28.300 --> 29:31.090
All I need is for you to swear an oath to me.

29:32.290 --> 29:33.950
Why not?

29:34.950 --> 29:37.463
I need a swordsman, for a bounty.

29:37.464 --> 29:39.790
Join me and we'll win it together.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.080
You're joking!

29:44.620 --> 29:46.428
You're not joking.

29:50.910 --> 29:54.679
Long ago, I swore an oath, to the Vitalian Empire.

29:54.680 --> 29:59.689
That oath, took me across the
world, and into this cage.

29:59.690 --> 30:01.699
I'm done with oaths.

30:01.700 --> 30:04.999
I saw you in the alley. You... you're a brave man.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.049
- I wouldn't go that far.
- No more masters, no magistrates!

30:08.050 --> 30:10.159
We-we'll create our own destinies.

30:12.360 --> 30:15.679
And what would those destinies
hold for us, little varmint?

30:17.580 --> 30:19.200
A life with dignity.

30:22.040 --> 30:25.620
Well, friend... for a life of dignity...

30:41.010 --> 30:42.310
Oh, God.

30:53.890 --> 30:57.359
Oh, here come the guards! Maybe
one of them has the key!

31:00.690 --> 31:02.059
Reckless balls...!

31:42.200 --> 31:43.760
Name's Thane.

31:46.640 --> 31:48.599
We need a thief.

31:48.600 --> 31:49.955
It's Thor's day.

31:50.956 --> 31:54.216
I believe there's one coupling
with my commander's wife.

31:55.716 --> 31:56.974
Well, there's our thief.

32:01.999 --> 32:03.199
Pssst!

32:03.220 --> 32:05.029
Boy!

32:05.220 --> 32:06.651
Boy!

32:07.152 --> 32:08.452
Boy!

32:11.954 --> 32:14.329
Go around the corner and tell the guards

32:14.330 --> 32:16.750
you saw a man climb into that window.

32:20.422 --> 32:22.211
What's on your leg?

32:22.912 --> 32:24.212
Go!

32:28.500 --> 32:30.233
What is that on your leg?

32:30.234 --> 32:31.420
Oh! My husband's back!

32:31.620 --> 32:35.111
<i>Take these! Go! Go! Go! No-no-no! Don't hurt me!</i>

32:54.368 --> 32:56.979
What is that thing on your foot?

32:56.980 --> 32:58.189
Where's my money?

32:58.190 --> 33:01.619
- I have no idea what you're talking about.
- In the hay wagon.

33:01.620 --> 33:03.154
I meet a lot of women in the hay.

33:03.155 --> 33:06.686
No offense, but, I... can't say
as I remember you, sweetheart!

33:07.586 --> 33:09.443
Wait, it's coming to me.

33:10.444 --> 33:12.542
What manner of insult is it you bring to me?!

33:12.543 --> 33:15.489
To this house! To my bed! Get away, you whore!

33:15.590 --> 33:17.749
Can we maybe discuss this somewhere else?

33:17.750 --> 33:19.260
Take your time, pal.

33:20.380 --> 33:22.690
Alright... alright.

33:22.691 --> 33:27.189
Given my very... limited... knowledge on thieves,

33:27.190 --> 33:30.179
I would assume you money is gone. Gambled away,

33:30.180 --> 33:33.618
or spent on very, very expensive women.

33:33.618 --> 33:35.369
You bastard!

33:35.370 --> 33:37.059
Most probably.

33:44.060 --> 33:47.909
I'm sorry, sweetheart. I'm
a harder catch than that.

33:47.910 --> 33:49.919
We're here to make you an offer.

33:52.076 --> 33:54.043
Guads! Guards! I can just...

33:54.070 --> 33:55.759
I need you for one mission.

33:55.760 --> 33:56.980
No chance, milady.

33:56.980 --> 34:00.139
Then we'll let the magistrate have
you, and she keeps her clothes.

34:00.240 --> 34:01.999
- What's the pay?
- 50 silver.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.300
100!

34:05.920 --> 34:08.819
- 100!
- Is now really the time to haggle?

34:09.520 --> 34:10.799
- 75.
- What?

34:10.800 --> 34:12.790
- Have him destroyed!
- I'm in!

34:44.101 --> 34:45.719
We're here.

34:46.920 --> 34:50.639
Weh-heh-heh-hell, well... allow me!

34:52.440 --> 34:53.929
Dagen.

34:53.929 --> 34:57.489
- And you are?
- Teela, from the order of Anisette.

34:57.490 --> 34:59.008
A holy woman?!

35:02.260 --> 35:07.769
A little girl, a Vitalian... and a miscreant.

35:07.770 --> 35:10.510
Pray the goddess may bless our worthy cause.

35:10.510 --> 35:11.710
Charming.

35:13.780 --> 35:16.329
There is an Orc encampment 10 leagues east.

35:16.330 --> 35:17.859
My sister is held there.

35:17.860 --> 35:19.829
We will rescue her under cover of night.

35:19.830 --> 35:23.855
You and I, under the covers, at night? I like it.

35:24.300 --> 35:26.810
Except without the dress. All done up in...

35:26.810 --> 35:29.510
why don't you stick out like a
lily in a pile of pig shite?

35:29.510 --> 35:31.689
- Done. Up!
- Should we head out?

35:31.690 --> 35:33.679
My white robes symbolize purity

35:33.680 --> 35:36.089
and show my dedication to the goddess, Anisette.

35:36.090 --> 35:39.885
And I will not be spoken to
like one of your common whores.

35:42.330 --> 35:45.129
Speak to ladies like whores, and whores, like

35:45.130 --> 35:48.498
ladies. Surprising what you get from both.

35:49.650 --> 35:52.159
I've ten leagues, yet, before I test this blade.

35:52.160 --> 35:53.740
Don't push me off.

35:59.100 --> 36:00.780
The goddess leads us.

36:04.310 --> 36:05.960
<i>"The goddess leads us."</i>

36:06.960 --> 36:08.925
Ten leagues.

37:23.030 --> 37:25.409
Maybe we should take a look around, down there.

37:25.410 --> 37:28.304
See if they... missed anything valuable.

37:28.305 --> 37:30.390
They are my friends and teachers.

37:32.860 --> 37:36.609
Should we go down there... to pick up the trail?

37:38.610 --> 37:40.180
Let's keep moving.

38:00.716 --> 38:02.704
What is that smell?

38:05.276 --> 38:06.660
We're to stay downwind.

38:06.660 --> 38:08.644
Keep low... and quiet.

38:12.416 --> 38:14.292
That's a lot of orcs.

38:14.292 --> 38:17.129
Right. Time to go home.

38:17.130 --> 38:19.492
If we fight, we die.

38:20.093 --> 38:21.664
I have a plan.

38:23.264 --> 38:25.040
I'll create a distraction.

38:25.041 --> 38:28.049
The meadow. Draw them out that way.
Get them to chase us.

38:28.050 --> 38:32.079
- Then Dagen will run in and...
- Oh, hey, no! Like hell I will!

38:32.160 --> 38:33.809
You out of your nut?

38:33.810 --> 38:35.510
Those aren't imaginary Orcs that your

38:35.510 --> 38:38.490
grandmother told you about, to
lull you to sleep, sweetheart.

38:38.491 --> 38:43.072
Those are real, bloodthirsty, musclebound animals.

38:43.073 --> 38:47.649
And we only have one musclebound animal.

38:47.650 --> 38:49.641
I can conjure a distraction.

38:49.642 --> 38:51.616
There's a lot of Orcs down there.

38:54.217 --> 39:00.499
Fine! Well, then, thief, you're going to slip
into the water, quietly... hop into those cages

39:00.500 --> 39:02.600
and find out which one has Teela's sister in it.

39:02.601 --> 39:04.460
- Mmm.
- Then come ashore when you're in the clear.

39:04.460 --> 39:07.619
- Well, what about freeing the other captives?
- Yeah, why not?

39:07.620 --> 39:09.794
And while I'm at it, I'll swipe some teeth

39:09.895 --> 39:12.024
from the biggest gooch's mouth.

39:12.025 --> 39:15.592
- Forget it!
- If anything happens, we'll attack...

39:15.713 --> 39:17.494
causing a distraction.

39:17.495 --> 39:19.649
It's a good plan.

39:19.650 --> 39:21.479
Naturally!

39:21.480 --> 39:24.579
And what about that guard,
down there by the cages?

39:24.580 --> 39:26.579
Maybe I'll make friends with him.

39:26.580 --> 39:30.499
All the while, Thane can spend the night, up
here, on the rocks, pleasuring you lovely ladies,

39:30.500 --> 39:34.359
while Teela's sex deprived
goddess watches on, with envy.

39:34.360 --> 39:37.494
Shove your dagger straight up through his bowels.

39:37.495 --> 39:40.690
He won't scream and death is instant.

39:42.630 --> 39:45.341
The sisters of my order
study principles of combat.

39:45.342 --> 39:48.549
- Dagen, if your thieving skills aren't up to it.
- My thieving skills?

39:48.620 --> 39:52.169
No-no-no-no-no. It's fine. I'll do it.

39:52.170 --> 39:57.000
Fyke! Always the thief gets
the sodden end of the stick!

39:57.000 --> 39:59.600
Teela, cut that out!

39:59.601 --> 40:01.330
Alright? It's bad luck.

40:06.830 --> 40:09.016
Alright, excuse me.

40:10.570 --> 40:12.639
What's she look like, this sister of yours?

40:12.640 --> 40:14.979
- Brown hair.
- Is she beautiful?

40:15.858 --> 40:18.000
Chances are improving.

40:27.800 --> 40:29.620
What's going on down there?

40:31.820 --> 40:33.875
Teela, is that your sister?

40:38.255 --> 40:39.790
No, a priest.

40:43.135 --> 40:45.698
That's him. He led the raid on my temple.

40:49.920 --> 40:52.140
- Where is the stone?
- I don't know.

40:58.912 --> 41:00.904
What is he doing to him?

41:06.082 --> 41:10.566
Necromancy. It's an old, dark magic,

41:10.567 --> 41:12.855
which draws on the life of survivors.

41:12.856 --> 41:15.599
I'd only ever heard tales of it, until now.

41:26.700 --> 41:28.729
I can't see Dagen.

41:29.430 --> 41:30.841
Any sign of him?

41:30.842 --> 41:33.342
Come on, thief, earn your pay.

41:50.810 --> 41:53.329
Which one of you is Teela's sister, Caeryn?

41:53.330 --> 41:54.964
They kill those of us who speak.

41:57.406 --> 41:59.160
I mean to free you.

41:59.660 --> 42:02.689
- The Ogre came and he took...
- Silence!

42:03.090 --> 42:06.199
Or my blade shall taste of your blood, again!

42:15.978 --> 42:18.018
So, what have we got, here?

42:21.346 --> 42:24.640
Put it in... easy, easy...

42:27.240 --> 42:30.800
A bit deeper... and... there she is.

42:32.183 --> 42:35.200
Right. Let's have a look at you.

42:36.503 --> 42:38.316
You're Caeryn?

42:41.220 --> 42:42.463
Caeryn isn't here.

42:42.463 --> 42:45.569
- What do you mean?
- I misunderstood.

42:45.770 --> 42:48.331
Goddess wants all of her worshipers released.

42:49.631 --> 42:52.707
They'll see we've escaped and come after us.

43:02.444 --> 43:05.029
Ohh...oh, no.

43:05.929 --> 43:07.811
Fyke! Don't do it.

43:14.075 --> 43:16.375
Alright. Alright. They've got him.

43:17.857 --> 43:20.641
No-no! Come on down whenever you're ready!

43:20.642 --> 43:22.036
It's going in!

43:27.797 --> 43:29.829
Do we have a plan?

43:29.830 --> 43:31.219
We fight.

43:31.220 --> 43:33.489
I thought you said we'd die.

43:33.490 --> 43:34.910
We'll see now, won't we?

43:59.260 --> 44:00.851
It is a lot of Orcs.

44:28.583 --> 44:29.777
Are you alright?

44:29.778 --> 44:31.276
Of course I'm not alright!

44:48.463 --> 44:49.877
Help Teela!

45:08.343 --> 45:10.330
You had to fyeking stab me.

45:10.331 --> 45:12.830
Teela, your combat training is shite!

45:12.830 --> 45:15.480
Leave us your women and you can live.

45:15.980 --> 45:18.440
How very Orkish of you.

45:38.440 --> 45:41.450
Leave me! I'm not afraid to die.

45:41.574 --> 45:43.074
Just do it, already.

45:47.808 --> 45:49.998
You had to fyeking stab me.

45:58.830 --> 46:00.702
Must have lost them.

46:01.902 --> 46:04.878
Not. Marek!

46:05.570 --> 46:08.342
Could really use some magic, right now!

46:09.342 --> 46:12.813
- Just leave me! I'm slowing you down!
- No!

46:12.814 --> 46:14.798
Our oath goes both ways!

46:20.062 --> 46:22.414
Move him faster, or drop him!

46:35.440 --> 46:38.819
Wait, wait! I know this place!

46:38.820 --> 46:40.879
Up there, we raided a camp here, once.

46:40.880 --> 46:43.407
There's a cave. It's hard to get to.

46:48.540 --> 46:50.055
I'm out of arrows!

46:56.790 --> 46:58.375
Hard to get to?

47:07.600 --> 47:09.600
I'm not gonna let you die!

47:15.010 --> 47:17.275
The bolt! Pull the bolt!

47:17.275 --> 47:19.475
- I'm alright!
- OK.

47:21.540 --> 47:23.272
Keep him quiet!

47:23.772 --> 47:25.618
Shhh! Quiet!

47:28.410 --> 47:30.630
I'm bleeding too fast!

47:31.730 --> 47:33.130
Move aside.

47:40.980 --> 47:44.556
Embrace the pain and welcome
death, should she beckon you.

47:49.604 --> 47:51.404
No! No!

48:26.116 --> 48:27.903
I couldn't get it all.

48:27.904 --> 48:31.023
It'll take time to fully heal you.

48:31.024 --> 48:32.682
But you will live.

48:33.882 --> 48:35.744
You are so beautiful.

48:35.744 --> 48:38.149
Sleep now. I will watch over you.

48:38.150 --> 48:39.428
Thank you.

48:45.785 --> 48:47.000
Thank you.

48:54.800 --> 48:56.566
I'm going to see what else is in here.

50:33.976 --> 50:35.545
It's Faltic.

50:41.160 --> 50:46.745
It needs to be placed on a shrine. It's a...
gift to the gods, to grant a wish for love.

50:48.668 --> 50:50.356
How do you know that?

50:51.856 --> 50:53.658
Personal experience, I'm afraid.

50:57.940 --> 51:00.601
It's far too pretty a thing for this place.

51:02.661 --> 51:05.427
I don't even know where we are.
What is this, a house?

51:05.428 --> 51:06.832
Ah, no.

51:06.832 --> 51:10.320
No, it's a-it's a runner's cache.

51:10.320 --> 51:13.674
Daring smugglers used to keep them
up and down the trade routes.

51:13.675 --> 51:16.010
It's long forgotten.

51:16.010 --> 51:23.526
But, um... might wish we asked to go
through them... being a slave in them.

51:24.630 --> 51:30.450
No, I ju... um, I just, uh... saw
the-the mark on your... neck.

51:31.850 --> 51:33.500
Explains a lot.

51:41.125 --> 51:42.710
I'm going to make a fire.

52:09.600 --> 52:12.920
Well, Teela. I presume the mission's over?

52:14.620 --> 52:18.779
Unless, of course, you have some idea as
to where your sister might actually be.

52:19.750 --> 52:22.384
My sister might have been taken by the Ogre.

52:22.386 --> 52:28.390
- The Ogre?
- Oh, yes, THE Ogre. And not just any Ogre...

52:28.400 --> 52:31.190
but the one that attacked
your temple, with the Orcs.

52:31.390 --> 52:36.158
A little-or should I say, a HUGE
detail that Teela left out.

52:36.159 --> 52:38.525
It's probably why she didn't want
us to go down there. We'd have

52:38.526 --> 52:41.479
- noticed all the evidence...
- No!

52:41.480 --> 52:44.559
- I mean, I didn't know the goddess led us to...
- Oh, the goddess be damned!

52:44.560 --> 52:48.149
I did my part, whether your
sister was there or not!

52:48.150 --> 52:51.100
Now I want my silver and then, I'll be going.

52:52.282 --> 52:54.150
I do not have your silver.

52:54.170 --> 52:56.170
- Ah!
- Not yet.

52:57.385 --> 53:00.879
Well, that's perfect, isn't it?

53:00.880 --> 53:04.295
The goddess has promised to
provide you with payment.

53:04.296 --> 53:06.200
OK. I'm done with you lot.

53:10.440 --> 53:12.630
I know, in my heart, that my sister is alive.

53:13.730 --> 53:15.641
I still have to find her!

53:15.642 --> 53:19.509
Yeah, well... good luck with that, priestess.

53:19.510 --> 53:20.650
Dagen, wait!

53:58.230 --> 54:00.692
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

54:00.693 --> 54:04.650
- This mission is suicide.
- It's suicide alone.

54:05.385 --> 54:07.419
Take my chances.

54:07.719 --> 54:11.106
You can come with me... if you like.

54:12.306 --> 54:14.155
I want to see this through.

54:17.005 --> 54:19.614
- Take care of Thane.
- Wait!

54:50.105 --> 54:51.605
Teela?

54:53.600 --> 54:54.700
No.

54:56.765 --> 54:58.265
I'm sorry.

54:59.240 --> 55:00.600
Nothing has changed.

55:04.830 --> 55:06.540
My promise is good.

55:09.140 --> 55:10.639
One bounty.

55:12.140 --> 55:14.140
We leave at dawn.

55:34.400 --> 55:35.750
Teela?

56:27.818 --> 56:29.810
You should rest.

56:30.110 --> 56:32.102
I've no need.

56:33.202 --> 56:38.320
Nor I. Sleep doesn't come so easily, now.

56:38.320 --> 56:41.229
Before this, I would sleep like a babe.

56:50.520 --> 56:52.570
This is very clever.

56:53.371 --> 56:57.189
Teela... you're a healer.

56:57.190 --> 57:01.600
Are you able to heal... anyone?

57:02.160 --> 57:09.449
Those with... pure intent, who have
faith to heal and be healed... yes.

57:09.450 --> 57:11.337
Am I pure enough?

57:11.338 --> 57:15.160
C-can your goddess... can she heal me...
my... my leg?

57:16.468 --> 57:17.768
Please?

57:42.360 --> 57:44.240
I'm sorry, Marek.

57:44.840 --> 57:46.930
It is not the will of the goddess.

57:47.830 --> 57:49.174
What?

57:50.374 --> 57:52.139
Why? Why?

57:52.140 --> 57:56.904
Your leg... it's a deliberate mark, from the gods.

57:56.905 --> 57:59.590
A reminder of the darkness inside you.

57:59.590 --> 58:03.859
I'm good! I know I am. There's no...
there's no darkness inside of me!

58:03.860 --> 58:07.960
We all harbor darkness... and all light.

58:15.900 --> 58:18.179
Then why am I different?

58:18.180 --> 58:19.960
And why can't I be healed?

59:00.470 --> 59:03.079
How recent do you think this Ogre trail is?

59:03.080 --> 59:04.999
Less than a day, I'd wager.

59:05.000 --> 59:10.857
- Are Vitalian soldiers trained in tracking?
- Aye. But men... not Ogres.

59:13.340 --> 59:15.549
Why become a soldier?

59:15.550 --> 59:19.719
A chance to see the world...
and swing a sword at it.

59:20.020 --> 59:21.689
And you?

59:21.690 --> 59:25.169
- Why did I chose the order of Anisette?
- Aye.

59:25.170 --> 59:27.539
It was my sister, who was first called.

59:27.540 --> 59:29.227
Greatly upsetting our father.

59:29.228 --> 59:32.179
I promised I would never follow in her footsteps.

59:32.680 --> 59:34.580
Nor did I desire to.

59:34.581 --> 59:36.999
Then, I found out he planned
to trade me to a nobleman

59:37.000 --> 59:41.479
for a tract of land. I refused
and ran to Caeryn and the order.

59:42.080 --> 59:44.809
The goddess has been my life, since.

59:44.810 --> 59:48.209
Not many girls would pass up a
chance to marry a nobleman.

59:48.210 --> 59:51.001
I refused to be traded like property.

59:51.002 --> 59:53.414
Well, we all sell ourselves
for something, in the end.

59:53.414 --> 59:55.592
That's rather bleak.

59:56.592 --> 59:58.390
Life is bleak.

01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:05.559
The imprint is deeper here.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:09.739
And lengthened... the Ogre was running.

01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:13.610
- Running? For what?
- From what?

01:00:16.275 --> 01:00:18.350
I have little experience with these creatures.

01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:24.522
Following blindly... is reckless.

01:00:26.322 --> 01:00:27.890
What do you suggest?

01:00:29.490 --> 01:00:33.169
I say we get up high... spy out the land.

01:00:34.170 --> 01:00:36.370
Learn what... might be waiting for us.

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:40.585
We don't have time.

01:00:40.586 --> 01:00:42.829
If your sister's still alive...

01:00:42.830 --> 01:00:45.209
there's no telling how much longer she has.

01:00:45.210 --> 01:00:47.210
We have the trail, let's keep going.

01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:22.060
Orcs.

01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:23.829
He chose his own path.

01:01:23.830 --> 01:01:27.095
He may have been taken captive.
He's likely still alive.

01:01:27.495 --> 01:01:28.970
Maybe.

01:01:29.070 --> 01:01:30.859
The goddess has her purposes.

01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:32.949
Dagen's fate is no longer our concern.

01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:35.499
I've heard enough of your damned goddess!

01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:38.159
What good is she to me, to you, to anyone?

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:40.609
Maybe Dagen had it right.

01:01:41.310 --> 01:01:44.694
Your temple is burned. Your
sister is probably dead.

01:01:44.695 --> 01:01:48.479
And chances are, we're probably
going to die here, too.

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:53.345
Maybe I'm not good enough... for you
and your goddess, to care about,

01:01:53.346 --> 01:01:58.391
but I know this. I'm not like your goddess.

01:01:58.392 --> 01:02:01.240
I wouldn't leave a friend to
die, alone, in the wilderness.

01:02:03.716 --> 01:02:05.788
The same way Dagen left us?

01:02:11.790 --> 01:02:14.844
- What was that?
- We need to move. Now!

01:02:18.170 --> 01:02:19.691
We need to find a clearing!

01:02:19.692 --> 01:02:22.660
We'll have a better chance of
fighting, if we can see it.

01:02:42.308 --> 01:02:44.510
Go on! Don't look in his eyes!

01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:48.230
- Blind me! I have looked directly into his eyes!
- Do we keep running or make a stand?!

01:02:48.327 --> 01:02:50.021
Keep running!

01:02:51.419 --> 01:02:54.916
- I thought we needed to find a clearing?!
- I'm trying!

01:03:15.810 --> 01:03:18.500
Stop playing around! Marek, run!

01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:40.421
- What was that?
- I don't wanna know.

01:03:41.622 --> 01:03:43.106
There's a clearing ahead!

01:04:10.350 --> 01:04:12.350
We should have scouted.

01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:25.896
Into the trees!

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:30.173
Leave me, I can make it!

01:04:30.574 --> 01:04:32.663
Put me down! Put me dow...

01:04:32.664 --> 01:04:35.056
- Shut up and hold on!
- Leave me!

01:04:37.342 --> 01:04:40.038
Faster! Run faster!

01:04:59.058 --> 01:05:01.049
Over here, you brute!

01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:04.040
Pretty!

01:05:09.614 --> 01:05:13.001
Marek! Forget about us! You must find the stone!

01:05:13.002 --> 01:05:14.994
The goddess leads you!

01:05:39.498 --> 01:05:41.220
Why won't you heal me?

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:02.566
Anisette, hear my prayer.

01:06:15.902 --> 01:06:19.045
<i>I have failed you, goddess.</i>

01:06:20.945 --> 01:06:26.285
<i>My friends are going to die. I was alone.
I was alone. I'm alone.</i>

01:06:27.090 --> 01:06:31.739
<i>Heal me. Heal me, so I can save my friends!</i>

01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:34.563
<i>Anisette, if you hear me, answer.</i>

01:06:34.564 --> 01:06:37.655
<i> If you hear me... answer.</i>

01:06:39.534 --> 01:06:42.017
<i>Answer me.</i>

01:06:42.819 --> 01:06:44.401
<i>Answer me.</i>

01:06:45.601 --> 01:06:47.295
<i>Answer me!</i>

01:06:51.122 --> 01:06:52.472
<i>Answer me.</i>

01:06:59.968 --> 01:07:02.555
<i>You're wrong!</i>

01:07:02.556 --> 01:07:04.548
<i>You're wrong about me.</i>

01:07:12.818 --> 01:07:14.902
To hell with the gods!

01:08:57.970 --> 01:09:01.038
What about a last meal, or something?

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:02.639
Some meat?

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:04.325
Ale would be nice.

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:09.224
Thanks very much.

01:10:26.728 --> 01:10:29.515
Marek. Thanks for it.

01:10:30.516 --> 01:10:32.599
Quiet... I'm concentrating.

01:10:39.978 --> 01:10:41.864
Thank you... very much.

01:10:51.432 --> 01:10:54.599
Don't mind me, I'm just a bit foxy.

01:11:08.566 --> 01:11:10.853
You have impeccable timing, Marek.

01:11:10.854 --> 01:11:13.869
The ugly one had a look in his eye I didn't like.

01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:16.181
Yep, yep, OK.

01:11:21.915 --> 01:11:23.575
This is yours.

01:11:23.776 --> 01:11:25.013
Oh, ho-ho-ho!

01:11:25.034 --> 01:11:29.298
Oh, my God! And I thought you'd deserted me!

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:33.030
Where are the others?

01:11:36.094 --> 01:11:38.080
You left them?

01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:40.959
- Smart.
- No.

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:42.930
We're going to rescue them.

01:11:44.030 --> 01:11:45.630
The Ogre?

01:11:46.430 --> 01:11:48.434
Fyke, Marek!

01:11:49.034 --> 01:11:50.379
Why?

01:11:51.279 --> 01:11:52.935
Because they're our friends.

01:11:56.279 --> 01:11:58.569
And I don't have many friends.

01:11:59.370 --> 01:12:01.065
And neither do you.

01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:05.699
I spotted the Ogre trail, not far from here.

01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:07.750
It's just over that ridge.

01:12:08.150 --> 01:12:09.630
Alright.

01:12:18.530 --> 01:12:20.463
Wait! Wait! Wait!

01:12:45.913 --> 01:12:49.085
- Yes, alright.
- Is this the Ogre's cave?

01:12:50.565 --> 01:12:53.078
I'd bet my magic wand we're at his doorstep.

01:13:00.442 --> 01:13:02.879
You know, you're asking the impossible, right?

01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:04.957
Surely not impossible for you.

01:13:06.557 --> 01:13:09.390
I just want to make sure
you'll appreciate my success.

01:13:14.810 --> 01:13:17.610
- What was that for?
- I'm probably falling in love.

01:13:34.618 --> 01:13:36.589
<i>Who's out there?</i>

01:13:37.090 --> 01:13:38.740
<i>Is there someone there?</i>

01:13:40.041 --> 01:13:41.519
<i>Please!</i>

01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:43.677
<i>Are you here to help me?!</i>

01:13:45.078 --> 01:13:46.664
<i>Who's there?</i>

01:13:48.422 --> 01:13:50.393
<i>I'm trapped! I can't get out.</i>

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.680
<i>Is there anyone there? I-I hear you.</i>

01:13:57.380 --> 01:13:59.080
<i>Is that someone out there?</i>

01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:05.179
<i>Who's there? Who's there? I'm in here!
I'm in here!</i>

01:14:08.855 --> 01:14:10.600
Psst! Anybody home?

01:14:14.310 --> 01:14:16.559
Who are you? Just... get me out of here.

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:18.603
Shhh, sh-sh-sh. Calm down, boy.

01:14:20.604 --> 01:14:22.484
Is there anyone else in there with you?

01:14:22.485 --> 01:14:24.719
A tiresome priestess, maybe?

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:26.595
No. I'm-I'm all alone.

01:14:26.796 --> 01:14:29.510
Alright, just... sit tight.

01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:32.879
Please! You have to save me!

01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:37.110
Please! Please! Get me out of here!

01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:39.311
Don't... don't leave me!

01:14:39.812 --> 01:14:41.787
<i>Where did you go?</i>

01:14:42.288 --> 01:14:44.271
<i>Come back! Come back!</i>

01:14:45.072 --> 01:14:46.551
<i>Please! Please, help!</i>

01:14:46.752 --> 01:14:48.150
Hello, beautiful.

01:14:48.151 --> 01:14:51.139
I'm Dagen. Your insane sister
sent me here to rescue you.

01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:55.895
- I'm not important. Take this.
 - <i>Please, get me out of here!</i>

01:14:59.052 --> 01:15:03.699
Take the stone. Bring it to the Paladins
at Sung Hill. They can protect it.

01:15:03.792 --> 01:15:05.470
Listen, sweetheart...

01:15:05.471 --> 01:15:09.199
We have gone through a lot of
trouble to get you out of here.

01:15:09.630 --> 01:15:12.939
<i>Come back, please! Please, get me out of here!</i>

01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:14.540
Shut it!

01:15:14.541 --> 01:15:18.209
You fool! Escape with the stone!
Nothing else matters!

01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:22.470
You remind me a lot of your sister.

01:15:26.163 --> 01:15:31.333
<i>Go! It's coming! Let's go and get out here!
It's coming!</i>

01:15:36.753 --> 01:15:44.153
<i>Let me go! Ahh! Ahhhh! Ahh!</i>

01:15:52.111 --> 01:15:53.609
Dagen move!

01:16:04.087 --> 01:16:07.736
Did you two want to quit lying
around and give me a hand?

01:16:08.236 --> 01:16:12.229
Dagen. By the gods, never thought
I'd be happy to see you again.

01:16:12.230 --> 01:16:16.845
Yeah, well, I was missing Teela's sunny demeanor.

01:16:16.846 --> 01:16:19.220
- Where's Marek?
- She's here.

01:16:20.180 --> 01:16:21.975
We're going to get you out of here.

01:16:27.348 --> 01:16:29.080
Ready, push!

01:16:32.161 --> 01:16:34.109
OK, OK. I'm, uh...

01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:37.553
- Uhh...
- Maybe we could the... Ogre to...

01:16:37.554 --> 01:16:40.821
He doesn't take them out to play with
them, he takes them out to eat them.

01:16:42.210 --> 01:16:43.735
I have an idea.

01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:47.699
Teela, remember that spell, in hideout?

01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:50.600
The one you were practicing on the kettle?

01:16:51.028 --> 01:16:52.430
Yes.

01:16:52.430 --> 01:16:54.600
Anisette, be merciful.

01:16:55.850 --> 01:16:57.550
Hang on to each other...

01:16:57.551 --> 01:16:58.899
tightly.

01:17:04.895 --> 01:17:06.195
Ready?

01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:27.620
Hold on, Teela, I've got you.

01:18:17.712 --> 01:18:19.008
Marek.

01:18:27.076 --> 01:18:31.072
- What was that?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:33.119
- It was the only way. I didn't mean...
- Yeah, well, it worked...

01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:35.419
but, never do it again.

01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:36.880
Did you find Caeryn?

01:18:39.290 --> 01:18:40.599
Caeryn?

01:18:41.090 --> 01:18:45.255
- Yeah, together, we might be able to move it.
- Yeah, Yeah.

01:18:45.460 --> 01:18:46.745
Push!

01:18:54.475 --> 01:18:57.415
- Sister!
- She's out. She's out.

01:18:58.870 --> 01:19:00.700
I'm gonna need something sharp!

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:21.538
This way!

01:19:36.607 --> 01:19:40.205
Come on! That way! Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:19:50.978 --> 01:19:52.660
I feel fresh air moving!

01:19:52.690 --> 01:19:54.851
This must be another way out.

01:19:54.852 --> 01:19:56.600
I see a light. This way!

01:20:00.926 --> 01:20:02.426
Get out, get out!

01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:19.209
Think you can make it?

01:20:20.010 --> 01:20:22.999
Probably, but how are we gonna
get the rest of you out?

01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:24.574
Help him.

01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:34.034
What is that?

01:20:43.892 --> 01:20:46.582
I've got a bad feeling about this.

01:21:01.224 --> 01:21:05.613
You wanna eat us? You'll have to crawl
in after us. We're not coming out.

01:21:05.681 --> 01:21:07.799
I'm not so sure about that!

01:21:08.999 --> 01:21:10.995
Here come the spiders!

01:22:02.093 --> 01:22:03.590
I'm out of arrows!

01:22:25.644 --> 01:22:28.444
Quickly... before it recovers!

01:22:34.727 --> 01:22:36.224
Oh, come on!

01:22:41.313 --> 01:22:44.409
There's the entrance! We can make it if we run!

01:24:51.354 --> 01:24:53.150
Well done, wizard.

01:24:59.637 --> 01:25:01.134
Is everyone alright?

01:25:04.626 --> 01:25:06.620
You did it.

01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:09.318
We did it.

01:25:15.405 --> 01:25:16.970
Are you kidding?

01:25:17.670 --> 01:25:19.196
There's no treasure!

01:25:19.597 --> 01:25:26.040
I have always heard... that Ogres...
amass hordes and hordes of treasure.

01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:27.650
That belongs to the temple.

01:25:28.450 --> 01:25:31.362
We must hurry. This country is unsafe, at night.

01:25:31.363 --> 01:25:32.930
At night?

01:25:33.630 --> 01:25:39.918
Hardly imagine anything worse...
than this country, during the day.

01:26:05.104 --> 01:26:07.800
How much for an Ogre's ear?

01:26:08.690 --> 01:26:10.650
An Ogre's ear, you say?

01:26:11.150 --> 01:26:18.146
I'd say that's worth... a free drink...
and a smidgen of respect.

01:26:18.646 --> 01:26:19.946
Done!

01:26:33.059 --> 01:26:35.920
I won't stop until I've reached the monastery.

01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:38.454
The Paladin will send the team their silver.

01:26:38.455 --> 01:26:40.229
I'm afraid for you.

01:26:40.230 --> 01:26:41.939
Why must you travel alone?

01:26:41.940 --> 01:26:43.869
My path is sure.

01:26:43.870 --> 01:26:45.819
I have no fear.

01:26:45.820 --> 01:26:49.069
And the goddess says you are to
stay here for the time being.

01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:51.099
I must take the stone to the Paladin.

01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:53.590
Farewell, my sister.

01:26:56.750 --> 01:26:58.755
Now, go. Be with your friends.

01:27:13.273 --> 01:27:19.155
<i>I said, you take that staff and you give it
to the captain... he knows right where to...</i>

01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:28.629
Maybe I'll... become a farmer?

01:27:28.630 --> 01:27:31.262
- Find a soft woman to settle down with.
- Oh.

01:27:33.062 --> 01:27:34.630
To adventure!

01:27:36.330 --> 01:27:39.010
- To a life of dignity.
- To riches and gold!
