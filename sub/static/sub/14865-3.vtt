WEBVTT

01:52.154 --> 01:54.440
The boy is blameless.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.813
That's my girl.

02:49.587 --> 02:51.043
Cack!

03:16.655 --> 03:19.237
You all right? You're looking pointy.

03:19.367 --> 03:20.982
What's the news from Ostia?

03:21.118 --> 03:24.076
Three grain ships from Alex in.
Mussa's people.

03:24.205 --> 03:25.945
Have a cup of wine. Set you up.

03:26.082 --> 03:27.993
Take 25, no less.

03:28.125 --> 03:30.161
Give the lading to Ajax.

03:31.754 --> 03:32.960
Well, Mussa will complain.

03:33.089 --> 03:35.375
If he does, out out his tongue.

03:39.178 --> 03:40.918
You think I'm joking?

03:42.223 --> 03:43.929
I'll see to it now.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.266
Vorenus...

03:55.986 --> 03:57.192
Nothing.

03:58.447 --> 04:00.483
Memmio of the Caelian is here.

04:00.616 --> 04:03.232
He asked to see you.

04:18.384 --> 04:19.965
Salve, Memmio.

04:20.970 --> 04:22.801
Please sit down.

04:26.058 --> 04:28.299
Weather's turning.
I like a bit of heat.

04:28.436 --> 04:31.223
What brings you
to the Aventine, Memmio?

04:32.064 --> 04:35.898
No ohitohat. Straight to cases. I like that.

04:36.026 --> 04:39.189
A young nephew
of my colleague Carbo here

04:39.321 --> 04:42.233
was defiled by an Aventine man.

04:42.366 --> 04:44.823
Name of Quintus Bubo.
You know him?

04:46.704 --> 04:48.035
I know him.

04:48.164 --> 04:51.702
With your permission, Carbo wishes
to avenge his family's honour

04:51.834 --> 04:54.871
— and kill this Quintus.
- The boy's only 12.

04:55.004 --> 04:57.336
He was sucking his cock for pennies.

04:57.465 --> 04:59.080
He was paid, then?

04:59.216 --> 05:02.424
Yes, but he didn't ask me first.

05:02.553 --> 05:04.669
The boy was paid.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.672
Nobody in my family
sucks cock without I say so.

05:08.934 --> 05:11.220
Carbo is from respectable people.

05:13.689 --> 05:14.849
The boy took money.

05:16.192 --> 05:18.649
He was working as a prostitute.

05:18.777 --> 05:21.234
Quintus Bubo's committed no offence.
You won't touch him.

05:21.363 --> 05:23.490
Brother Vorenus,
perhaps you misunderstand.

05:23.616 --> 05:27.234
l misunderstand nothing, brother.

05:27.369 --> 05:30.907
I've been given strict mandate
by Mark Antony to maintain the peace.

05:31.040 --> 05:34.203
Quintus Bubo is a man
of property and respect.

05:34.335 --> 05:36.997
You will not touch him.

05:37.129 --> 05:39.666
Money or not though,
he took advantage of the boy.

05:39.798 --> 05:42.710
Perhaps some moderate
form of punishment...

05:44.053 --> 05:47.762
We come to you out of politeness.
A mere formality.

05:47.890 --> 05:49.426
I've given you my answer.

05:49.558 --> 05:51.298
Wrong fucking answer.

05:51.435 --> 05:54.643
This maggot pisses on my name,
on my family honour.

05:54.772 --> 05:57.434
Control your man, Memmio.

05:57.566 --> 05:59.306
Vorenus, the man has a fair point.

05:59.443 --> 06:01.229
Silence, Pullo!

06:02.238 --> 06:03.944
Brother Vorenus, in all candour,

06:04.073 --> 06:05.404
even your own man knows...

06:05.533 --> 06:08.570
My man doesn't know
when to keep his mouth shut.

06:19.964 --> 06:22.376
I've given you my decision.

06:23.509 --> 06:25.465
And we graciously accept your judgment.

06:25.594 --> 06:27.835
I thank you for your time

06:27.972 --> 06:30.554
and I apologise for the disruption.

06:38.607 --> 06:39.938
You didn't have to insult me in front of...

06:40.067 --> 06:42.058
Do not question my authority
in front of others.

06:42.194 --> 06:44.606
Do not question my authority
under any circumstances.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.729
Authority?

06:56.333 --> 06:58.289
Hard being the boss?

07:15.311 --> 07:16.426
Good stuff.

07:16.562 --> 07:18.803
Is it? How does one tell?

07:19.690 --> 07:21.021
Try.

07:29.992 --> 07:31.653
Hold your breath.

07:37.041 --> 07:38.030
lt's horrid.

07:39.126 --> 07:41.333
In a minute, you'll feel delicious.

07:45.382 --> 07:46.997
You know Jocasta.

07:48.135 --> 07:49.045
Do |?

07:49.178 --> 07:52.716
— We met at the theatre last year. l was with...
— What are you doing?

07:53.724 --> 07:54.839
We're inhaling hemp.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.011
I can see that.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.260
You're making the whole house stink.

07:59.396 --> 08:03.105
— In future, do it outside if you must.
— Yes, Mother.

08:05.361 --> 08:07.852
— Is it any good?
— Excellent.

08:09.114 --> 08:10.854
Give it here.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.573
I brought back two sacks from Macedonia.

08:16.705 --> 08:18.536
So much better than the Italian kind.

08:20.918 --> 08:22.499
Macedonia?

08:22.628 --> 08:24.835
Papa has quarries there.

08:24.963 --> 08:27.420
We're going there when Antony
takes up his governorship.

08:27.549 --> 08:30.006
My dear, it's ghastly.

08:31.720 --> 08:34.632
Filthy climate, vile food, beastly people.

08:34.765 --> 08:39.429
— Perhaps you didn't mix in the best society.
- Oh, no, Papa is hideously rich,

08:39.561 --> 08:41.893
but there's no society to be found.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.354
The men are overly fond
of fucking their sheep.

08:44.483 --> 08:47.270
And when you meet the women,
you can hardly blame them.

08:47.403 --> 08:49.735
It truly is the end of the world.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.492
I'm no snob, Octavia,

08:57.621 --> 09:01.739
and I don't mind that you bring home
a tradesman's daughter...

09:03.085 --> 09:05.792
but let's just stop there, shall we?

09:05.921 --> 09:09.584
No actors, no gladiators,
or that sort of thing, nay?

09:15.556 --> 09:17.137
Don't mind her.

09:17.266 --> 09:20.679
She's been an infernal grump
since Octavian left.

09:23.439 --> 09:26.431
Send to ask Antony
when he's coming home. No, don't.

09:26.567 --> 09:27.647
A fig for him.

09:27.776 --> 09:29.858
Yes, domina. Timon is waiting,

09:29.987 --> 09:33.320
asking if it pleases you to see him.

09:51.175 --> 09:52.915
Domina.

09:55.137 --> 09:57.219
— Domina...
- Go away.

09:57.347 --> 10:00.089
— But Merula said...
— Changed my mind.

10:35.093 --> 10:36.879
Hello, Duro.

10:50.108 --> 10:51.894
Yes, it's good.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.692
It's good.

11:10.379 --> 11:12.119
Very good!

11:15.050 --> 11:17.416
Hello, Aba. We're learning Hebrew.

11:17.553 --> 11:20.545
- I can see that.
— They'll be reading Torah in no time.

11:20.681 --> 11:22.763
I can't wait.

12:17.821 --> 12:20.483
You came in very late last night.

12:21.283 --> 12:23.319
Business.

12:23.452 --> 12:26.660
Business involving wine, vomit and sex.

12:27.706 --> 12:29.537
I'm sorry, did I disturb you?

12:29.666 --> 12:31.748
No, not at all.

12:31.877 --> 12:34.163
But do please wake me
before you come at me so.

12:34.296 --> 12:36.662
It would be a little less...

12:36.798 --> 12:38.663
alarming.

12:42.971 --> 12:45.963
l was thinking about Macedonia.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.350
Were you?

12:47.476 --> 12:51.060
Do we have to go?
Can't we just...stay here?

12:51.188 --> 12:52.803
No.

12:52.940 --> 12:56.023
Once my consulship is over, we're gone.

12:56.151 --> 12:58.392
But it's so far from Rome.

12:58.528 --> 13:01.065
They have dressmakers

13:01.198 --> 13:05.157
and jewel merchants
in Odessa just like here.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.367
Once you're gone from Italy

13:07.496 --> 13:09.361
your enemies will no longer fear you

13:09.498 --> 13:11.864
and you will be powerless
to strike at them.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.207
I don't want to strike at them.

13:14.336 --> 13:16.793
There's no juice in it anymore.

13:16.922 --> 13:18.787
I want peace and quiet

13:18.924 --> 13:21.586
and a nice rich province to squeeze.

13:21.718 --> 13:24.130
Peace and quiet?

13:24.262 --> 13:28.346
While you're swilling wine in Macedonia,
will Brutus and Cassius be idle?

13:28.475 --> 13:30.557
Those abject creatures?

13:30.686 --> 13:34.019
Abject only while you have power.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.399
Your enemies will not rest
until you are dead.

13:36.525 --> 13:39.517
You have a wolf by the ears.
You cannot let go of him now.

13:49.788 --> 13:51.494
Pass the oil, would you?

14:06.471 --> 14:07.722
Make way!

14:30.120 --> 14:32.111
Well, thank you. Thank you very much.

14:32.247 --> 14:34.408
We'll see you next week? Yeah, OK.

14:35.917 --> 14:37.703
- Brother!
— Who was that man?

14:38.545 --> 14:41.582
— Who?
— The man you were speaking with.

14:41.715 --> 14:43.751
You mean Barak.
He's a saffron trader.

14:43.884 --> 14:45.875
Doesn't look like a saffron trader.

14:46.553 --> 14:50.091
Not everybody looks like what they are.

15:05.864 --> 15:07.445
Justice, Captain!

15:07.574 --> 15:09.314
— I beg forjustice!
- Who's this?

15:09.451 --> 15:11.407
Quintus Bubo and his wife.

15:11.536 --> 15:13.072
Gelded by Memmio's boys.

15:16.708 --> 15:18.790
Please, Captain, justice!

15:24.132 --> 15:25.793
Come on. Calm down, brother.

15:25.926 --> 15:28.133
He shouldn't have been goating around.

15:28.261 --> 15:31.424
- Memmio disobeyed me.
— He didn't kill the old fool at least.

15:31.556 --> 15:34.389
- He disobeyed me!
— Let me go talk to Memmio.

15:34.518 --> 15:37.180
— l'll sort out a compromise.
— No.

15:37.312 --> 15:40.179
If you punish Carbo over this trivia,

15:40.315 --> 15:42.601
Memmio is going
to take it as disrespect.

15:42.734 --> 15:44.850
He'll retaliate. You'll start a gang war.

15:44.986 --> 15:46.726
Very likely, but I've got no choice.

15:46.863 --> 15:51.448
- And it's your fault.
— What? How is it my fault?

15:51.576 --> 15:53.362
You questioned my authority.

15:53.495 --> 15:57.033
— That gave him license to disobey me.
— Oh, bollocks.

15:57.165 --> 15:58.826
Now, you go and find Carbo.

15:58.959 --> 16:02.543
You show him the same disrespect
that he has shown me.

16:02.671 --> 16:05.754
— Everyone is in the wrong here.
- I gave you an order.

16:05.882 --> 16:09.249
This isn't the mumpin' Legion.
I take orders from no man.

16:09.386 --> 16:11.877
Then you're no use to me. You, go and do it.

16:12.013 --> 16:14.675
Will do, Captain.

16:16.685 --> 16:18.266
You are thinking all backwards.

16:18.395 --> 16:21.887
I warned you about questioning my authority.
You learn your place.

16:22.023 --> 16:24.810
My place? Well, fuck you,
you miserable bastard,

16:24.943 --> 16:26.808
I'm the one trying to keep you alive.

16:26.945 --> 16:29.027
You'd love to start a gang war.

16:29.156 --> 16:31.568
Get yourself killed.
Put an end to all your misery.

16:31.700 --> 16:33.406
Take half the city with you.

16:33.535 --> 16:36.242
Well, | tell you what.
You can die a thousand times.

16:36.371 --> 16:40.410
And it won't bring back Niobe
or the children or Caesar!

16:40.542 --> 16:42.749
Listen, I'm your friend. I'm trying to help.

16:42.878 --> 16:45.745
— You've never helped me.
— Have I not?

16:45.881 --> 16:47.462
Well, who saved your life a dozen times?

16:47.591 --> 16:49.252
Who took care of that snake Evander?

16:59.311 --> 17:01.302
What do you mean?

17:01.438 --> 17:03.303
"Took care of Evander."

17:03.440 --> 17:05.726
Nothing... I didn't mean anything.

17:07.402 --> 17:09.358
What do you mean?

17:12.324 --> 17:14.064
Speak.

17:17.871 --> 17:19.953
I killed him.

17:22.751 --> 17:24.582
Listen, she loved you.

17:24.711 --> 17:28.545
You were happy together.
If I'd told you, you would have killed her.

17:28.673 --> 17:30.129
Get out!

17:31.343 --> 17:32.753
What was I supposed to do?

17:32.886 --> 17:34.751
Get out.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.978
Atia thrives, I trust?

17:53.114 --> 17:55.105
She does. She does.

17:56.117 --> 17:58.403
And the rest of the family?

17:58.536 --> 18:00.117
Good enough.

18:00.247 --> 18:02.488
Yes, a surprising boy, isn't he?

18:03.333 --> 18:06.621
Octavian. Such vim and vigour
for one so young.

18:06.753 --> 18:09.711
They say it's a considerable army he's raised.

18:09.839 --> 18:13.206
Buying up all the fools
and cripples in Campania

18:13.343 --> 18:15.550
is hardly raising an army.

18:15.679 --> 18:18.716
You are right, no doubt.

18:18.848 --> 18:21.339
But many are veterans also.

18:21.476 --> 18:25.139
Eighth Legion men. Seventh Legion.

18:25.272 --> 18:28.309
Sat on their backsides taking his money

18:28.441 --> 18:31.524
to cheer him as he goes by.

18:31.653 --> 18:34.690
Caesar my arse.

18:34.823 --> 18:38.111
But I didn't bring you here to talk of children.

18:38.785 --> 18:41.322
Indeed, I await your pleasure.

18:57.345 --> 18:59.961
When my term as consul is over...

19:00.098 --> 19:03.556
| no longer wish to take the governorship
of Macedonia.

19:03.685 --> 19:05.346
| wish to take Gaul.

19:06.187 --> 19:08.439
But Decimus is Governor of Gaul.

19:08.565 --> 19:11.398
Well, he can have Macedonia if he likes.

19:11.526 --> 19:15.144
I want Gaul. The weather's better.

19:15.280 --> 19:19.239
I'm afraid that will be a bit difficult.

19:24.914 --> 19:27.906
The Senate may suppose
you plan to emulate Caesar,

19:28.043 --> 19:30.034
camping your legions on our border.

19:30.170 --> 19:33.583
Close enough to Rome

19:33.715 --> 19:35.831
to scare us into doing anything you wish.

19:37.635 --> 19:41.594
Steady on. Hadn't even crossed my mind.

19:41.723 --> 19:43.759
| just prefer Gaul.

19:43.892 --> 19:46.725
But you understand why the Senate

19:46.853 --> 19:48.969
would not pass such a measure?

19:49.105 --> 19:52.563
You are the Senate, Cicero.

19:55.403 --> 19:57.780
The next time we meet,

19:57.906 --> 20:01.444
perhaps you will propose
my governorship of Gaul.

20:01.576 --> 20:06.946
No one can make any trouble
if the noble Cicero is backing me.

20:07.082 --> 20:09.869
I don't think that's a good idea.

20:12.587 --> 20:15.795
Not that I do not wish to help you...

20:15.924 --> 20:17.585
as a friend.

20:17.717 --> 20:21.209
But the Senate would know I was backing you

20:21.346 --> 20:24.930
only through...through fear of death.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.305
I understand.

20:29.437 --> 20:32.725
You do not want to seem cowardly.

20:34.359 --> 20:37.317
Well, tell them I bribed you.

20:38.029 --> 20:39.644
Would you accept a bribe?

20:39.781 --> 20:41.863
I would not.

20:43.076 --> 20:45.032
Rich enough?

20:45.161 --> 20:47.026
Well, it's always worth a try.

20:51.376 --> 20:54.368
Well, you leave me only one option, then.

20:54.504 --> 20:58.122
It always comes to this.

20:58.842 --> 21:00.127
I know.

21:01.261 --> 21:03.126
I'm sorry.

21:04.472 --> 21:06.463
Such times we live in.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.507
Please, go on.

21:09.644 --> 21:11.805
Make your threats.

21:12.730 --> 21:15.767
I don't like to submit to mere implication.

21:25.034 --> 21:28.652
There is a question
I've always wanted to ask you.

21:30.373 --> 21:32.409
Your old friend Crassus,

21:32.542 --> 21:35.750
when he was captured by the Parthians,

21:35.879 --> 21:39.792
is it true that they poured
molten gold down his throat?

21:39.924 --> 21:43.837
Because that would really sting.

21:47.891 --> 21:50.177
Thank you.

21:53.271 --> 21:55.478
It is correct, what you say.

21:57.108 --> 22:00.851
The weather in Macedonia is...

22:00.987 --> 22:02.648
dreadful.

22:26.095 --> 22:28.757
I thought maybe you'd want to know a bit more

22:28.890 --> 22:31.632
— than what I said.
— I don't.

22:34.395 --> 22:36.477
You should know Niobe wasn't...

22:36.606 --> 22:38.267
Don't speak of her.

22:39.317 --> 22:41.558
It's in the past. It is done.

22:43.279 --> 22:46.771
Brother, I'm sorry I kept it from you.

22:46.908 --> 22:49.240
I thought it was for the best. I'm sorry.

22:50.036 --> 22:52.027
I forgive you, brother.

22:53.748 --> 22:57.332
I understand why you didn't tell me.
I understand.

22:59.087 --> 23:01.920
— I hear you say that, but...
— I mean it.

23:04.092 --> 23:05.457
I forgive you.

23:07.929 --> 23:10.887
How could I not forgive you, Pullo?

23:11.015 --> 23:13.131
You're all I've got left in life.

23:25.113 --> 23:27.479
Keeping me alive?

23:29.450 --> 23:31.156
This business with the Caelians...

23:31.286 --> 23:35.279
- What of it?
— We can still stop it turning into a war.

23:35.415 --> 23:37.121
Let Carbo pay a fine.

23:37.250 --> 23:38.786
If I go and talk quietly to Memmio

23:38.918 --> 23:42.285
we can sort it out
so that no one loses face.

23:42.422 --> 23:44.538
You suggested that before.

23:44.674 --> 23:47.416
Worth a go. Better than a war.

23:47.552 --> 23:49.088
You may be right. You may be.

23:49.220 --> 23:51.882
But it's too late now.

23:53.474 --> 23:55.135
Move.

24:11.492 --> 24:13.483
Salve, Carbo.

24:18.541 --> 24:19.656
Get him up.

24:30.053 --> 24:32.419
No!

24:43.274 --> 24:46.186
Tell your mistress
l have a message from her son.

25:13.888 --> 25:15.799
Piss and blood!

25:20.812 --> 25:23.895
Forgive the intrusion. l was entranced.

25:25.650 --> 25:26.981
Who are you?

25:27.110 --> 25:29.977
I am Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa,

25:30.113 --> 25:31.774
a friend of Caesar...

25:31.906 --> 25:34.773
of Octavian as was.

25:34.909 --> 25:37.150
Have I the honour of speaking
to his sister Octavia?

25:37.286 --> 25:39.413
Yes. Is my brother here?

25:39.539 --> 25:42.451
There's nothing wrong, is there?
He's all right?

25:42.583 --> 25:44.494
No... Yes.

25:44.627 --> 25:47.334
I mean, no, he's not here.
But yes, he's well.

25:47.463 --> 25:49.454
I left him five days ago, thriving.

25:49.590 --> 25:50.966
Happy

25:51.092 --> 25:53.799
— I am to convey his best wishes to you.
- No letter?

25:53.928 --> 25:56.670
I told him he ought to write,
but you know how he is.

25:56.806 --> 25:58.342
Please.

26:01.310 --> 26:05.019
In place of writing, I am charged to tell you
that he loves you as ever

26:05.148 --> 26:07.309
and to answer any questions you may have,

26:07.442 --> 26:09.683
consonant with political security.

26:09.819 --> 26:12.686
He's grown no less pompous, then?

26:12.822 --> 26:15.734
lt suits him better now than at school.

26:15.867 --> 26:16.902
He's a powerful man.

26:17.034 --> 26:19.992
So everyone says. I cannot believe it.

26:20.121 --> 26:21.361
My little brother.

26:21.497 --> 26:24.159
Your little brother has an army 10,000 strong.

26:24.292 --> 26:28.205
l have written him a hundred times
asking him to stop this madness.

26:28.337 --> 26:32.250
— But he does not listen to me.
- On the contrary.

26:33.301 --> 26:36.793
I think you are the only person in the world
he does listen to.

26:39.098 --> 26:40.429
Is this the messenger?

26:41.809 --> 26:44.801
This is Agrippa, a friend of Octavian.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.643
Deeply honoured.

26:48.858 --> 26:49.938
And so?

26:50.067 --> 26:51.932
He asked that | make certain you're well,

26:52.069 --> 26:54.651
and to assure you of his respect and fidelity.

26:55.615 --> 26:57.276
We're very well.

26:58.618 --> 27:01.360
And as for his respect and fidelity...

27:01.496 --> 27:03.202
He begs that in the name of family

27:03.331 --> 27:06.494
you keep an open mind
as to your future prospects.

27:08.044 --> 27:11.377
You came all the way
from Campania to say that?

27:11.506 --> 27:14.168
— l have other business.
— With whom?

27:14.300 --> 27:16.131
I am not at liberty to say.

27:17.720 --> 27:19.506
lntrigue, is it?

27:21.891 --> 27:24.883
Does Mark Antony know
that you're in the city?

27:25.019 --> 27:28.728
I expect there are many citizens
whose location is unknown to the Consul.

27:28.856 --> 27:31.563
True, but he does like to know

27:31.692 --> 27:33.683
— where the traitors are.
— Mother!

27:33.820 --> 27:36.232
Well, they are traitors, aren't they?

27:36.364 --> 27:38.104
Antony is consul in Rome,

27:38.241 --> 27:40.698
and Octavian is deliberately
challenging him.

27:42.119 --> 27:45.327
If this is not a traitor, I don't know what is.

27:45.998 --> 27:47.954
l have said what I must.

27:48.084 --> 27:49.745
I will take your leave to go.

27:49.877 --> 27:51.868
Tell my son I...

27:55.424 --> 27:58.336
No, tell him nothing.

28:09.814 --> 28:12.271
Send to tell Antony that Marcus Agrippa
is in the city.

28:12.400 --> 28:13.981
Mother, no!

28:14.110 --> 28:15.771
Who knows what Antony will do to him?

28:15.903 --> 28:17.518
Nothing pleasant, I would think.

28:17.655 --> 28:19.771
He is your son's friend.

28:20.533 --> 28:22.444
l have no son.

28:41.262 --> 28:44.299
Althea, my honey. How goes it?

28:44.432 --> 28:47.924
— You know you're not allowed in the kitchen.
— But I'm hungry.

28:48.060 --> 28:50.267
You won't tell on me, will you?

28:55.651 --> 28:57.607
You should try some.

29:20.217 --> 29:22.299
We've been waiting for you.

29:23.471 --> 29:25.302
Keep waiting. Where's your mistress?

29:25.431 --> 29:28.343
— Never mind about my mistress.
— I want to speak to her.

29:28.476 --> 29:30.387
She doesn't speak to the like of you.

29:30.519 --> 29:33.135
And I don't speak to the like of you.

29:33.272 --> 29:35.058
She wants the job done, she'll see me.

29:35.191 --> 29:37.102
You speak to me.

29:38.277 --> 29:39.687
Maybe some other time.

29:40.529 --> 29:42.269
Wait.

29:48.788 --> 29:51.495
So you're Servilia, then, are you?

29:52.833 --> 29:55.085
Choice. Very choice.

29:55.211 --> 29:57.372
Address me by my name again

29:57.505 --> 30:00.212
and I'll have your tongue
nailed to a wagon wheel.

30:00.341 --> 30:03.708
Forgive me. I've not spoken
to nobility before.

30:06.430 --> 30:08.842
— What's his name?
— Duro.

30:13.062 --> 30:14.848
Eleni was right.

30:14.981 --> 30:17.347
You're a pretty little man, aren't you?

30:22.446 --> 30:25.358
You've been in the house of the Julii
for some time now.

30:25.491 --> 30:27.197
Why is Atia still alive?

30:27.326 --> 30:29.442
Trouble's finding the right time.

30:29.578 --> 30:31.990
They always eat together,
her and the daughter.

30:32.123 --> 30:34.739
If I can kill the young cunny
I can do it tomorrow.

30:34.875 --> 30:37.287
No. No harm to the girl.

30:37.420 --> 30:42.335
Well, then, if I could only put the poison
on Antony's cock, we'd be sweet.

30:43.009 --> 30:45.716
The domina dines on that regular.

30:45.845 --> 30:47.927
Failing that, you'll have to be patient.

30:48.055 --> 30:50.467
You have only foul jokes to tell me.

30:50.599 --> 30:53.090
— Why are you come here?
- Shekels, queen.

30:53.227 --> 30:56.264
- Shekels.
— He wants money.

30:56.397 --> 30:58.683
Has he not already been paid?

30:58.816 --> 31:01.307
The job's taking longer than we thought.

31:01.444 --> 31:03.059
Let's be fair.

31:04.989 --> 31:06.195
Give him what he asks.

31:06.323 --> 31:08.450
Make it 300.

31:17.710 --> 31:19.291
Wait!

31:20.421 --> 31:22.878
Give me a kiss before I go.

31:23.007 --> 31:26.591
— Excuse me?
- Kiss me.

31:29.055 --> 31:30.716
I don't think so.

31:30.848 --> 31:33.840
You want this woman dead? Kiss me.

32:11.138 --> 32:13.470
That's very good.

32:13.599 --> 32:18.844
So if we could return to the subject of money...
please bear in mind, Your Excellency,

32:18.979 --> 32:22.312
that those that help us now
will have good friends in Rome

32:22.441 --> 32:26.309
when Mark Antony, the traitor, is deposed.
Very good friends.

32:26.445 --> 32:29.437
It's only a matter of time.
With or without your help,

32:29.573 --> 32:31.859
we shall raise an army.

32:31.992 --> 32:33.072
We shall.

32:33.202 --> 32:36.069
Antony's head will rot on a spike.

32:37.998 --> 32:41.786
There are Roman women
who are fucked by baboons.

32:41.919 --> 32:43.455
Excuse me?

32:43.587 --> 32:47.330
I've heard there are shows
where such things can be seen.

32:49.552 --> 32:53.010
They're not so much shows, really.
They're more a punishment.

32:53.848 --> 32:56.055
I should like to see that.

32:56.183 --> 32:57.889
We do not have such in Bithynia.

32:58.686 --> 33:02.770
I should imagine it's simply a matter
of training the baboons.

33:02.898 --> 33:04.889
We have no baboons here.

33:05.025 --> 33:06.981
No apes of any kind.

33:07.111 --> 33:09.318
I wasn't aware of that.

33:09.446 --> 33:12.313
So as I say, those who help us now...

33:12.449 --> 33:16.567
Yes, you want my money
to raise an army.

33:16.704 --> 33:20.663
I want to see a Roman woman
fucked by baboons.

33:23.210 --> 33:24.871
Perhaps arrangements can be made.

33:27.214 --> 33:30.832
I killed him. I did.

33:30.968 --> 33:32.583
I had to.

33:32.720 --> 33:34.085
You know, it's in my blood.

33:34.221 --> 33:37.429
My ancestor dethroned
the tyrant Tarquin.

33:37.558 --> 33:41.267
I understand there were a great many
who stabbed your Caesar.

33:42.479 --> 33:44.310
I delivered the final blow.

33:44.440 --> 33:47.022
Seems a bit cowardly, no?

33:47.902 --> 33:48.891
You say what?

33:49.028 --> 33:52.020
He was wounded already —
dying, defenceless, alone.

33:52.156 --> 33:54.397
And you stabbed him yet again.

33:55.034 --> 33:57.116
He was a tyrant.

33:57.244 --> 33:59.280
Our killing him was a necessity.

33:59.413 --> 34:00.869
A necessary and noble act.

34:00.998 --> 34:04.035
Perhaps I shall find a fresh corpse to stab

34:04.168 --> 34:07.752
- and become great myself.
— What, you dare to insult me?

34:08.923 --> 34:11.289
- Excuse me.
— A senator of Rome?

34:11.425 --> 34:12.881
Stand up.

34:14.303 --> 34:16.464
— Stand up!
— Perhaps we should get some air?

34:16.597 --> 34:19.430
No, this man...this dog insults me.

34:19.558 --> 34:21.765
Dog, he says? I'm a dog?

34:21.894 --> 34:23.555
Excuse us. It's the wine, the heat.

34:23.687 --> 34:25.518
We are guests here! Looking for favour.

34:25.648 --> 34:29.436
Favour? | ask no favour of such animals.

34:31.904 --> 34:34.316
Control yourself, you fool.

34:34.448 --> 34:36.905
They called me a coward.

34:38.661 --> 34:41.198
Come with me. Come on.

34:43.207 --> 34:44.993
I am a senator.

34:49.338 --> 34:53.081
— My friend, you have lost your way.
- Leave me alone.

34:53.217 --> 34:55.674
- Brutus...
— Leave me alone!

35:14.446 --> 35:16.107
I'm sorry.

35:19.159 --> 35:21.150
I'm sorry.

35:51.358 --> 35:54.145
Wine in the bath? Bad sign.

35:54.278 --> 35:55.893
You're late again.

35:56.030 --> 35:58.066
Revise your expectations, my dear,

35:58.198 --> 36:01.361
- and I will always be early.
— Did you get my message?

36:02.286 --> 36:04.026
About?

36:04.163 --> 36:06.449
Octavian's man Marcus Agrippa.

36:06.582 --> 36:08.368
Oh, yes, yes. I know all about him.

36:08.500 --> 36:11.242
— Well, did you catch him?
- There's no need.

36:11.378 --> 36:13.369
But he's up to no good.

36:13.505 --> 36:16.167
I know exactly what he's up to.

36:16.300 --> 36:18.461
Octavian sent him to meet with Cicero,

36:18.594 --> 36:21.882
— hoping to form an alliance against me.
— Well, then?

36:22.014 --> 36:24.471
Cicero will refuse.

36:24.600 --> 36:26.966
l have my foot on his throat.

36:29.063 --> 36:32.226
And I'm happy for your son to know it.

36:32.358 --> 36:35.976
Agrippa can come and go as he pleases.

36:38.947 --> 36:40.938
What will become of Octavian?

36:42.701 --> 36:45.113
Don't worry yourself.

36:45.245 --> 36:46.781
I'll not harm him.

36:49.416 --> 36:51.156
Swear it.

36:51.960 --> 36:55.202
On Jupiter's stone. He's family.

37:06.600 --> 37:09.012
If they catch us, they'll crucify us.

37:10.229 --> 37:12.015
Watch for the guard.

37:35.421 --> 37:39.005
When I get through, you pass Lucius to me.

37:45.431 --> 37:47.217
Hey, come here.

37:47.349 --> 37:49.260
Lyde! Lyde!

37:49.393 --> 37:51.008
Lyde, no!

38:04.741 --> 38:07.824
Oh, Gaia, give me a hand here.

38:07.953 --> 38:09.989
Carry your own piss.

38:12.624 --> 38:15.457
Bitch pig whore.
See how you like a whipping.

38:23.594 --> 38:26.711
Are we sure that it's Memmio's work?

38:26.847 --> 38:28.553
Caelian coin in his mouth.

38:30.184 --> 38:32.175
Call armed assembly.

38:36.565 --> 38:38.931
Here we go.

38:39.067 --> 38:41.353
You think we should ignore this, I suppose?

38:41.487 --> 38:44.229
No, you wanted a war, you got it.
We have to fight now.

38:44.364 --> 38:47.606
You don't think you should go and talk
to Memmio? Find a compromise?

38:47.743 --> 38:49.074
It's too late for that.

38:49.203 --> 38:51.239
Surely he'd listen to you, wouldn't he?

38:53.207 --> 38:55.038
Are you saying I'm with Memmio?

38:55.167 --> 38:57.328
I didn't say it, you did. Quick as Mercury.

38:57.461 --> 38:59.076
Brother...

38:59.213 --> 39:01.454
Brother, can't you see
what's happening to you?

39:01.590 --> 39:04.081
I can't see it, brother.
What is happening to me?

39:04.218 --> 39:07.210
What is it that you can see
so clear that I can't?

39:07.346 --> 39:09.928
A demon. A demon has possessed you
or I don't know what.

39:10.057 --> 39:13.140
You see a demon, is it?
What does it look like?

39:13.268 --> 39:15.520
Listen to yourself, man. Me and Memmio?

39:15.646 --> 39:18.137
How could you think that? I'm your friend.

39:18.273 --> 39:20.104
I love you. I would never betray you.

39:20.234 --> 39:22.566
Lying to me, going behind my back.

39:22.694 --> 39:25.731
— It was never like that.
- It wasn't like that?

39:25.864 --> 39:28.446
You tell me, did you enjoy fucking my wife?

39:28.575 --> 39:30.816
— What?
— Is that why you didn't tell me,

39:30.953 --> 39:32.443
because you were fucking her?

39:32.579 --> 39:33.989
You have stepped over the line.

39:34.122 --> 39:37.330
Did you fuck my wife?
I am asking you a question.

39:37.459 --> 39:39.290
- Get out of my way.
— I am asking you a question!

39:39.419 --> 39:41.284
What can I say? You won't believe me.

39:41.421 --> 39:45.209
— If you tell the truth then I will believe you.
— On the bones of my mother,

39:45.342 --> 39:49.711
there was nothing between me and Niobe.
Nothing, never.

39:49.846 --> 39:51.757
I don't believe you. Tell me the truth.

39:51.890 --> 39:53.471
All right, I fucked her! All right?

39:53.600 --> 39:55.636
I fucked her! Me and half the men on the hill.

39:55.769 --> 39:57.384
Any time you were away, bang!

39:57.521 --> 39:59.102
Legs open, line at the door.

40:42.774 --> 40:44.150
Come on.

40:49.489 --> 40:51.400
Are you all right?

41:19.519 --> 41:22.647
Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

42:02.562 --> 42:05.099
Where are we going now?

42:05.232 --> 42:08.269
I don't know. Anywhere.

42:08.402 --> 42:10.563
Away from this damn place.

43:36.948 --> 43:39.325
Divine Janus,

43:39.451 --> 43:42.784
as this day follows the night,

43:42.913 --> 43:45.825
let me start my life anew.

43:45.957 --> 43:49.415
As the shore is scoured by the tide,

43:49.544 --> 43:52.206
let me be cleansed.

43:52.339 --> 43:55.923
As the seed becomes the flower,

43:56.051 --> 43:58.167
let me be born again.

44:34.714 --> 44:36.579
I'm so sorry. Am I late?

44:36.716 --> 44:39.423
We have completed taking roll.
A quorum exists.

44:39.553 --> 44:40.884
Excellent.

44:41.012 --> 44:43.799
Then let us begin.

44:46.560 --> 44:48.471
No, actually, not quite yet.

44:48.603 --> 44:52.437
| see that Cicero outdoes me
in his tardiness.

44:52.566 --> 44:54.431
Cicero is regrettably ill

44:54.568 --> 44:56.854
and unable to attend this session.

44:56.987 --> 44:59.649
But he has an important matter to propose

44:59.781 --> 45:01.897
regarding my governorship of Gaul.

45:02.033 --> 45:04.069
Should I send my litter bearers for him?

45:04.202 --> 45:07.490
He did, however, provide me with a speech

45:07.622 --> 45:11.410
that he most urgently insisted
be read into the rolls.

45:13.128 --> 45:18.748
Well, then, by all means,
let us hear the words of mighty Cicero.

45:20.343 --> 45:25.383
These being the words
of Marcus Tullius Cicero —

45:29.644 --> 45:33.683
"When I was a young man,
| defended our state.

45:33.815 --> 45:37.478
"As an old man, I shall not abandon it.

45:37.611 --> 45:40.273
"I give sincere thanks to Mark Antony,

45:40.405 --> 45:42.612
"who has generously presented me

45:42.741 --> 45:45.483
"with the most promising
theme imaginable.

45:47.370 --> 45:49.952
"I address you directly, Antony.

45:50.582 --> 45:53.039
"Please listen as if you...

45:54.961 --> 45:57.043
"as if you..."

45:58.131 --> 45:59.792
Go on.

46:01.176 --> 46:03.041
"Please listen...

46:03.178 --> 46:06.011
"as if you were sober and intelligent

46:06.139 --> 46:10.599
"and not a drink—sodden, sex—addled wreck."

46:13.563 --> 46:16.350
"You are certainly not
without accomplishments.

46:17.817 --> 46:21.230
"It is a rare man who can boast
of becoming a bankrupt

46:21.363 --> 46:23.445
"before even coming of age.

46:27.577 --> 46:30.284
"You have brought upon us war,

46:30.413 --> 46:34.201
"pestilence and destruction.

46:34.334 --> 46:36.746
"You are Rome's Helen of Troy.

46:39.172 --> 46:41.003
"But then...

46:42.008 --> 46:44.420
"But then..."

46:44.552 --> 46:46.292
Go on.

46:48.223 --> 46:50.555
Go on!

46:52.185 --> 46:55.393
"..a woman's role has always suited you best."

47:21.589 --> 47:23.125
Write a note.

47:24.342 --> 47:27.960
To Octavian...Caesar, rather.

47:29.305 --> 47:31.091
Tell him I have exposed Antony

47:31.224 --> 47:34.591
for the debauched rat he is.

47:35.812 --> 47:39.976
At this time, the Republic would be
most grateful to accept

47:40.108 --> 47:43.396
Caesar's offer of assistance.

47:43.528 --> 47:46.565
We shall need his army at once.

47:54.205 --> 47:55.661
ln Gaul,

47:55.790 --> 47:59.248
the renegade Mark Antony has laid siege

47:59.377 --> 48:01.242
to the city of Mutina.

48:01.379 --> 48:04.871
But salvation is at hand!

48:05.008 --> 48:07.374
The Senate sends an army

48:07.510 --> 48:11.628
led by the generals
Hirtius and Pansa.

48:11.765 --> 48:15.883
The noble patriot, young Caesar Octavian,

48:16.019 --> 48:19.637
joins our generals with his own legions

48:19.773 --> 48:22.890
to crush the rebels.

48:31.785 --> 48:34.652
So much travelling. All the way to Massilia,

48:34.788 --> 48:37.325
now come all the way back. Crazy.

48:37.457 --> 48:39.869
Sorry, love. Had to do it.

48:40.001 --> 48:42.458
The gods have me vexed over Vorenus.

48:42.587 --> 48:44.623
I can't go on until I sort things out with him.

48:44.756 --> 48:46.997
That's all.

48:47.133 --> 48:49.124
Then we'll be on our way again.

48:54.099 --> 48:56.090
What's happened?

49:09.197 --> 49:11.108
Anyone home?

49:16.704 --> 49:19.195
- Pullo!
— Mascius.

49:20.291 --> 49:21.792
What's all this?

49:21.918 --> 49:25.285
Expecting visitors.
I never thought I'd see you again.

49:25.421 --> 49:27.082
Nor I you.

49:27.215 --> 49:30.457
Anyroad, it's good to have you home.
We need every man we can get.

49:30.593 --> 49:34.381
We're not stopping.
ljust came to talk to Vorenus. Where is he?

49:34.514 --> 49:35.720
Well, he's not here.

49:35.849 --> 49:37.430
When is he back?

49:38.309 --> 49:41.096
I don't know. He's gone.
Went north with Mark Antony.

49:42.021 --> 49:44.148
— Went north?
- Months ago.

49:44.274 --> 49:47.061
Antony gathered his troops
and set off to take Gaul.

49:47.193 --> 49:50.777
Vorenus went with him.
Asked for special by Antony himself.

49:50.905 --> 49:53.396
He's left me in charge
of a right old mess.

49:53.533 --> 49:55.945
Ever since we gave
Carbo one up the arse,

49:56.077 --> 49:59.569
Caelian boys and their friends have been
going at us like Belgians.

49:59.706 --> 50:01.037
We lost ten men this month.

50:01.166 --> 50:03.873
— Come on, are you sure you're not stopping?
— What?

50:04.711 --> 50:07.043
No. | just came to talk to Vorenus.

50:19.475 --> 50:21.602
What now?

50:21.728 --> 50:23.389
I don't know.

50:24.397 --> 50:26.388
I don't understand it.

50:27.567 --> 50:29.899
The gods are playing tricks.

50:30.028 --> 50:32.895
"Go back to Rome," they say.
"Talk to Vorenus."

50:33.031 --> 50:34.896
Then they hide him from me.

50:38.578 --> 50:40.034
I did as l was told.

50:40.163 --> 50:42.404
If he's not here, he's not here.

50:42.540 --> 50:44.326
I can leave him a letter.

50:44.459 --> 50:47.417
"Dear Vorenus, I don't fuck your wife."

50:48.504 --> 50:49.914
Something like that.

50:55.094 --> 50:56.675
Let's be going.

50:58.806 --> 51:00.967
Best get out of Italy.

51:01.100 --> 51:03.227
A civil war is coming again, looks like.

51:03.728 --> 51:05.468
You people.

51:06.731 --> 51:08.767
Is this the way to Aventine...

51:11.110 --> 51:12.771
Pullo!

51:14.697 --> 51:16.483
Don't you know me?

51:16.616 --> 51:18.652
Lyde?

51:18.785 --> 51:20.116
Yes.

51:22.163 --> 51:24.870
l'm Lyde. l'm Lyde.

51:24.999 --> 51:27.456
But you're all right. You're all right.

51:27.585 --> 51:29.667
— Thank you.
— Where have you been?

51:29.796 --> 51:33.584
The children! The children are alive!

52:00.159 --> 52:01.990
Where's Octavia?

52:02.120 --> 52:04.111
Out with Jocasta.

52:06.416 --> 52:07.872
Excellent.

52:08.001 --> 52:11.164
I shall finally be able
to enjoy my dinner in peace.

52:49.542 --> 52:52.409
- What is this?
— Sea urchins, domina.

52:52.545 --> 52:54.581
I don't care for it. What else is there?

52:54.714 --> 52:57.706
A savoury stew of goose
and root vegetables.

52:58.509 --> 53:00.500
Bring me that.

53:06.726 --> 53:08.262
Still here?

53:08.978 --> 53:10.809
Can't get enough of you, my love.

53:12.065 --> 53:13.726
Come here.

53:43.596 --> 53:45.097
Go on.
