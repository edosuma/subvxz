[ Laughs ]
Perfect.
>> Darwin: Bobert, we're going

13:21.735 --> 13:25.136
to find you a girlfriend.
>> Gumball: What? Why?
>> Darwin: Because his life is

13:25.138 --> 13:29.974
pathetic and he needs some love.
Now, walk up to Tina.
She's desperate, and you are...

13:29.976 --> 13:33.378
Available?
>> But i don't know how to talk
to girls.

13:33.380 --> 13:36.648
>> Gumball: And he's probably
not gonna appreciate switching
out of slave mode to find he's

13:36.650 --> 13:39.584
married to some Jurassic meat
sack.
What am i talking about?

13:39.586 --> 13:44.122
This is the funniest idea ever.
>> Hey, baby girl.
>> [ Growls ]

13:44.124 --> 13:48.593
>> This might come as a shock...
>> Darwin: But i can see there's
an energy inside you.

13:48.595 --> 13:52.597
>> But i can see there's an
energy inside you.
>> Darwin: In fact, if we got...

13:52.599 --> 13:57.368
>> Together, sparks would fly.
>> Darwin: It would be...
>> Electric.

13:57.370 --> 14:02.006
>> Whoa.
No one's ever spoken to me with
such poetry before.

14:02.008 --> 14:06.211
>> Darwin: I'm...
>> Gumball: Not talking to you.
>> I'm talking to the fuse box.

14:06.213 --> 14:10.448
>> [ Growls ]
>> Gumball: I'm sorry.
I just couldn't help it.

14:10.450 --> 14:14.285
They kept talking about all that
electric stuff, and the fuse box
was there.

14:14.287 --> 14:18.356
>> [ Roars ]
[ Clanging ]
>> Gumball: [ Stops laughing ]

14:18.358 --> 14:20.959
>> Darwin: I can't believe you
did that to bobert.
All of this because of your

14:20.961 --> 14:24.529
stupid game.
>> Shh!
>> Gumball: Dude, whisper.

14:24.531 --> 14:27.665
>> Darwin: I am whispering!
>> Gumball: No, you're just
doing a whispery voice.

14:27.667 --> 14:30.668
If anything, it's louder than
normal.
Look, if you want to make bobert

14:30.670 --> 14:34.839
happy, you treat him like a
normal kid, not a charity case.
>> Darwin: Go tell that to his

14:34.841 --> 14:38.376
head.
>> Well, i patched him up as
best i can, but for the last

14:38.378 --> 14:42.513
time, I'm a nurse, I'm not a
mechanic.
>> Well, I'm not a florist or a

14:42.515 --> 14:47.886
meteorologist or some kind of
freak-show owner, but you don't
see me complaining, do you?

14:47.888 --> 14:51.956
>> Hmm!
[ School bell rings ]
>> Gumball: Bobert, would you

14:51.958 --> 14:55.360
rather have an awesome friend or
a patronizing fairy godmother?
>> Darwin: I'm not a fairy

14:55.362 --> 14:58.196
godmother!
>> Get out of here!
Can't you see I'm on my break?

14:58.198 --> 15:02.333
>> Gumball: Aw, dude, she's even
more upset than you are.
She seriously needs to chill

15:02.335 --> 15:05.003
out.
[ Ding! ]
<i>She seriously needs to chill</i>

15:05.005 --> 15:09.307
<i>out.</i>
Fetch!
Hmm.

15:09.309 --> 15:12.877
All right, smarty-pants.
No arms this time.
Fetch!

15:12.879 --> 15:16.981
>> Darwin: So, this is treating
him like a normal kid, huh?
>> Gumball: Ah, a normal kid who

15:16.983 --> 15:21.552
lost his bet fair and square.
Do you think i wouldn't do the
same to you?

15:21.554 --> 15:26.090
This time, no feet.
Fetch!
>> Darwin: I guess you would,

15:26.092 --> 15:30.495
but still, this is no way to
treat a, uh...
>> Gumball: Go on, say it.

15:30.497 --> 15:33.231
A challenged person?
>> Darwin: No.
>> Gumball: You think you're

15:33.233 --> 15:36.501
better than him?
It took you five years to learn
facial expressions, and there

15:36.503 --> 15:40.605
are still some you don't know.
What's this one?
>> Darwin: You're making it

15:40.607 --> 15:44.542
difficult on purpose!
>> Gumball: don't worry.
I made this one up, but that's

15:44.544 --> 15:47.378
my point.
Bobert has to learn.
He's a pretty sharp kid, you

15:47.380 --> 15:50.748
know.
don't let the dog get it!
[ Dog barking ]

15:50.750 --> 15:55.987
>> Ah! Ah! Ah!
Aah! Oh!
You're lucky I'm a licensed

15:55.989 --> 16:01.192
rollerblader, okay?
If i hadn't been able to perform
a safe roll, you could have lost

16:01.194 --> 16:06.764
a friend.
Blades for life.
You be careful now.

16:06.766 --> 16:10.234
>> Gumball: This world needs
less rollerbladers, man.
[ Beeping ]

16:10.236 --> 16:14.472
[ Laser blasting ]
>> Aah!
I'm okay!

16:14.474 --> 16:18.142
>> Gumball: Hey, Darwin, check
this out.
Bobert, divide by zero.

16:18.144 --> 16:22.413
>> [ Stammering ]
>> Darwin: See, that's the
problem here.

16:22.415 --> 16:26.084
Any other kid, normal or not,
would have some limits, but a
robot just doesn't.

16:26.086 --> 16:29.253
It's unfair to do that to him.
>> Gumball: Why are you so
uptight about this?

16:29.255 --> 16:32.357
I don't see anyone else having a
problem with it.
>> Darwin: That's because no one

16:32.359 --> 16:34.859
else is here.
>> Gumball: Huh.
Where is everybody?

16:34.861 --> 16:38.196
>> Hey, what are you still doing
here?
School's canceled today.

16:38.198 --> 16:41.899
There's no teachers.
>> Gumball: No teachers?
Get out of here.

16:41.901 --> 16:46.904
[ Beeping ]
>> Aah!
>> Gumball: Uh, what just

16:46.906 --> 16:49.841
happened here?
>> Following command.
>> Gumball: Dude, i never asked

16:49.843 --> 16:53.778
you to throw him out the window.
I said, "get out of here."
[ Clang! ]

16:53.780 --> 16:56.280
What the droid?
>> Darwin: See?
I told you.

16:56.282 --> 16:59.417
A robot's got no limits or
common sense.
This can only go bad.

16:59.419 --> 17:03.588
>> Gumball: Oh, come on.
As long as i don't say, "bobert,
terminate gumball," or whatever,

17:03.590 --> 17:06.057
it's fine.
[ Beeping ]
>> Darwin: Put an end to it!

17:06.059 --> 17:09.127
>> Gumball: No. Ow!
Okay.
Bobert, you don't take orders

17:09.129 --> 17:13.297
from anyone now, all right?
Aah! What the --?
What's your problem, man?

17:13.299 --> 17:16.734
>> Following command.
>> Gumball:<i> Bobert, terminate</i>
<i>gumball.</i>

17:16.736 --> 17:19.237
Oh, yeah.
Uh, delete that from your
memory.

17:19.239 --> 17:22.607
>> Command denied.
>> Gumball:<i> Bobert, you don't</i>
<i>take orders from anyone now,</i>

17:22.609 --> 17:25.443
<i>all right?</i>
- >> Commence termination.
[ Beeping ]

17:25.445 --> 17:30.248
[ Both screaming ]
[ Laser blasting ]
>> Darwin: Why am i running?

17:30.250 --> 17:33.084
It's you he's trying to
terminate.
>> Gumball: Because you wanted

17:33.086 --> 17:35.520
to hear me say i was wrong.
>> Darwin: You know me well,
don't you?

17:35.522 --> 17:38.856
>> Gumball: Aah!
[ Both coughing ]
>> Darwin: Wait!

17:38.858 --> 17:49.267
I have an idea.
[ Crying ]
Look at what you've done.

17:49.269 --> 17:54.105
He was all i had.
>> Gumball: [ Shivering ] Come
on, come on, come on, take the

17:54.107 --> 17:58.309
bait.
>> I'm sorry, watterson.
I know this isn't appropriate,

17:58.311 --> 18:02.380
but i just need to warm up.
>> Gumball: Aaaahhh!
Get off! Get off! Get off!

18:02.382 --> 18:05.883
>> Wait!
I'm so cold!
[ Laser blasting ]

18:05.885 --> 18:11.656
Ahh, that's better.
>> Gumball: [ Panting ]
Oh, thank goodness.

18:11.658 --> 18:15.526
You need to help me.
Bobert's gone crazy.
>> [ Sighs ]

18:15.528 --> 18:17.895
Here you go.
>> Gumball: What's that?
>> Tech-support hotline.

18:17.897 --> 18:24.402
I am not a mechanic.
[ Bobert approaching ]
>> Gumball: Aah!

18:24.404 --> 18:34.078
Thanks!
Aah!
[ Telephone dialing, ringing ]

18:34.080 --> 18:36.514

for calling our technical
support.

>> Gumball: Yes, hi, i have a
problem --
>> to book an appointment with

18:39.285 --> 18:41.886
one of our technicians, press
one.

>> gumball: Dagnabbit, you
stupid answering machine!
If i wanted to talk to --

18:45.125 --> 18:49.093
>> no need to be rude, sir.
If you did this job all day,
you, too, would end up talking

18:49.095 --> 18:51.829
like a machine.
[ Laser blasting ]
>> Darwin: Watch out!

18:51.831 --> 18:57.201
>> Gumball: Aah!
>> Darwin: What are you doing?
>> Gumball: Getting my change.

18:57.203 --> 19:07.945
>> Darwin: Just get out of here!
[ Beeping ]
I'm sorry, gumball, i can't slow

19:07.947 --> 19:12.150
him down any longer.
My belly's too chafed.
Ooh!

19:12.152 --> 19:15.987
Oh, wait, never mind.
He's still going at exactly the
same pace.

19:15.989 --> 19:18.389
>> Gumball: Come on, come on.
How do you stop a robot?
I thought books were supposed to

19:18.391 --> 19:26.164
be useful.
Hmm.
[ Grunting ]

19:26.166 --> 19:30.034
>> [ Squeaking ]
>> Gumball: Darwin, i got him!
>> Darwin: [ Muffled ] You got

19:30.036 --> 19:32.870
me, too.
>> Gumball: Are you okay?
>> Darwin: Oh, I'm fine...

19:32.872 --> 19:36.274
Apart from the fact that none of
this would have happened if it
wasn't for this stupid game!

19:36.276 --> 19:40.411
>> Gumball: It's not my fault.
He wanted to be treated like a
normal kid, so i treated him

19:40.413 --> 19:43.447
like one because that's what he
is.
Aren't you, bobert?

19:43.449 --> 19:46.450
>> Initiating countdown.
>> Gumball: Oh, great, he's
gonna self-destruct.

19:46.452 --> 19:49.086
Even when I'm right, I'm wrong.
>> 10...
>> Gumball: Please tell me

19:49.088 --> 19:52.557
that's minutes and not seconds.
>> Darwin: Get me out of here!
>> ...9...

19:52.559 --> 19:56.194
>> Gumball: [ Grunting ]
>> ...8...
>> Gumball: Dude, I've got a

19:56.196 --> 19:58.196
plan.
It involves me running out that
door.

19:58.198 --> 20:01.799
The problem is only one of us
survives.
What? You got a better idea?

20:01.801 --> 20:04.835
>> ...7...
>> Darwin: Defuse him!
>> Gumball: What?

20:04.837 --> 20:08.706
Like, water him down?
>> Darwin: No, not dilute.
Defuse, like a bomb!

20:08.708 --> 20:11.776
>> ...6...
>> Gumball: Hmm.
Do you have one of those tiny,

20:11.778 --> 20:15.046
tiny screwdrivers?
No?
Oh, well.

20:15.048 --> 20:17.515
>> ...5...
>> Gumball: Who would have
thought that it would all end

20:17.517 --> 20:20.117
like this, huh?
>> Darwin: There's still five
seconds to do something!

20:20.119 --> 20:24.222
>> ...4...
>> Darwin: What are you doing?!
>> Gumball: I'm waiting until he

20:24.224 --> 20:27.024
gets to three so i get that
super strength you get in
life-threatening situations.

20:27.026 --> 20:29.727
>> ...3...
>> Gumball: [ Grunts ]
Not gonna happen.

20:29.729 --> 20:32.396
>> ...2...
>> Gumball: So, i guess it's
time for some good last words,

20:32.398 --> 20:35.433
huh?
>> ...1...
>> Gumball: [ Inhales ]

20:35.435 --> 20:42.306
[ Sighs ]
>> ...Zero.

Slave mode de-activated.
[ Both sigh ]
>> Want to play another game?

20:46.746 --> 20:48.946
>> Gumball: Uh...
Yeah, all right.
