                 Hi! Where's Ma?

00:58.458 --> 00:59.724
Oh, hi, honey.                  

00:59.726 --> 01:02.393
She's out with Irene Lorenzo    
and Irene's sister.             

01:02.395 --> 01:04.262
I'm cooking dinner              
as a surprise.                  

01:04.263 --> 01:05.697
        Hey, it smells great.   

01:05.699 --> 01:07.832
Yeah, it's a recipe             
that Frank Lorenzo gave me.     

01:07.834 --> 01:10.669
It's called, er,                
 <i>cheval à la Bordelaise.</i>        

01:10.671 --> 01:12.503
                  Wait a second.

01:12.505 --> 01:15.339
                      <i>Cheval.</i>   

01:15.341 --> 01:18.176
      Isn't that the French word
              for horse?        

01:18.178 --> 01:19.778
Uh-huh.                         

01:25.551 --> 01:28.286
     You're cooking horse?      

01:28.288 --> 01:31.189
Michael, don't be upset. Lots of
 people are eating it nowadays. 

01:31.191 --> 01:33.992
     I'm not eating horse.      

01:33.994 --> 01:35.526
            Why not?            

01:35.528 --> 01:38.830
 Because it used to be a horse! 

01:38.832 --> 01:42.934
Michael, a cow used to be a cow 
and a lamb used to be a lamb,   

01:42.936 --> 01:43.968
but you eat them.               

01:43.970 --> 01:45.870
                Gloria, that's  
              totally different.

01:45.872 --> 01:48.039
         I'll stick with cheese.

01:48.041 --> 01:49.074
Michael, you're                 
just being emotional.           

01:49.076 --> 01:50.875
I want you to give me           
a good reason                   

01:50.877 --> 01:52.276
why you're not                  
gonna even try it.              

01:52.278 --> 01:53.511
                  I'll give you 
                 a great reason!

01:53.513 --> 01:54.846
            It's against the law

01:54.848 --> 01:57.082
     to sell horsemeat for human
    consumption in New York!    

01:57.084 --> 01:58.683
Yeah, but it's not illegal      
in New Jersey                   

01:58.685 --> 02:00.585
and that's where                
this horsemeat's from.          

02:00.587 --> 02:03.654
Mr. Devlin. You know, he's      
the buyer down at the store?    

02:03.656 --> 02:05.023
He got it for us.               

02:05.025 --> 02:06.791
His family eats it              
all the time.                   

02:06.793 --> 02:08.592
          Fine, let them eat it.
            I'm not eating it.  

02:08.595 --> 02:11.730
      Oh, Michael, come on.     
 It's a great way to save money.

02:11.732 --> 02:13.832
     You know how high the price
         of beef is nowadays.   

02:13.834 --> 02:15.299
I know, Gloria.                 

02:15.301 --> 02:18.436
I know I'm being irrational     
about this, but it's just that  

02:18.438 --> 02:20.171
we're taught certain things     
right from the cradle.          

02:20.173 --> 02:21.572
I mean, certain things          
are for eating                  

02:21.574 --> 02:22.841
and certain things              
are not for eating.             

02:24.443 --> 02:28.146
It's very, very difficult       
to break those habits.          

02:31.450 --> 02:32.851
Hey, what is this?              

02:32.853 --> 02:34.385
        BOTH: Horsemeat!        

02:34.387 --> 02:35.586
Oh, my God!                     

02:35.588 --> 02:37.255
Why did you                     
do that to me?                  

02:37.257 --> 02:39.057
You slipped me                  
a piece of horsemeat!           

02:39.059 --> 02:40.091
                 Oh, Michael!   

02:40.093 --> 02:42.293
                      Michael!  
     Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!        

02:42.295 --> 02:43.862
                 Don't be upset!

02:43.864 --> 02:45.930
Oh, jeez! How could you         
do that to me?                  

02:45.932 --> 02:46.931
                     Come on!   

02:46.933 --> 02:48.166
I can't eat horse!              

02:48.168 --> 02:49.167
I'm eating horse.               

02:49.169 --> 02:51.035
                      All right.

02:51.037 --> 02:52.703
            You're eating horse.
             How does it taste? 

02:52.705 --> 02:54.172
     It tastes like horse.      
            Come on, Michael.   

02:54.174 --> 02:57.075
I saw that look on your face    
  when you put it in your mouth!

02:57.077 --> 02:58.743
        Tell me the truth.      
    You liked it, didn't you?   

03:00.445 --> 03:02.881
     It was okay.               

03:02.883 --> 03:04.115
            It was just okay?   

03:04.117 --> 03:06.117
No, really, it wasn't that bad. 
It was very good.               

03:06.119 --> 03:07.118
                      Well, see?

it's horsemeat?

Well, what about Ma?            

03:17.998 --> 03:19.463
                    Not gonna   
                tell her either.

03:19.465 --> 03:20.865

04:18.190 --> 04:20.423
Yeah, I know.                   
Irene just introduced us.       

04:20.426 --> 04:23.527
                  Not, she's    
              a "sister" sister.

04:23.529 --> 04:25.196
                I'm a nun, Mike.

Really? Gee, you're not dressed 
like the nuns I used to know

Oh, Theresa, what about         
when you're on duty?

                    gave me.    

05:19.852 --> 05:22.020
What is that?                   
                It's a saint.   

05:22.022 --> 05:23.454
Take the saint                  
off of you.                     

05:23.456 --> 05:24.488
                            Why?

05:24.490 --> 05:27.758

                 we'd better go.

     I ain't got no respect     
        for no religion         

05:39.572 --> 05:41.872
where the head guy claims       
he can't make no mistakes.      

05:41.874 --> 05:44.742
    You know, like he's what    
  do you call--? Inflammable.   

05:46.245 --> 05:47.912
        Did you mean infallible,
                 Archie?        

05:47.914 --> 05:51.382
I believe the pope is infallible
      in matters of faith.      

05:51.384 --> 05:52.917
I believe                       
it devoutly.                    

05:52.919 --> 05:54.385
  Then I'm sorry for you, sis.  

05:54.387 --> 05:57.355
 You're as big a religious nut  
     as your sister Irene.      

05:57.357 --> 06:00.358
          Mr. Bunker,           
     we don't have to agree     

06:00.360 --> 06:02.293
        with everything         
    His Holiness says,          

06:02.295 --> 06:05.729
  but his job is interpreting   
        the law of God,         

06:05.731 --> 06:08.933
  just like the Supreme Court   
 interpreting the Constitution. 

06:08.935 --> 06:11.836
                 If the pope    
            ever made a mistake,

06:11.838 --> 06:15.673
                do you think God
                 would fire him?

06:15.675 --> 06:19.143
No, Edie, the pope              
is like the civil service.      

06:19.145 --> 06:21.446
The guy is in                   
for life.                       

06:25.851 --> 06:27.251
                    That's good.

06:27.253 --> 06:30.921
        It must be nice having  
      somebody looking after you

06:30.923 --> 06:32.923
                 and telling you
                what to do.     

06:32.925 --> 06:35.526
  Oh, Edith, there's much more  
        to our religion         

06:35.528 --> 06:37.628
        than just having        
    somebody look after you.    

06:37.630 --> 06:39.330
     It's like a deep well.     

06:39.332 --> 06:42.500
     You can always dip in      
      and renew yourself.       

06:42.502 --> 06:43.834
    That's the trouble          
      with you Catholics.       

06:43.836 --> 06:45.236
    You won't quit renewing     
        yourselves              

06:45.238 --> 06:47.872
 and we've got too many people  
     in the world already.      

06:50.209 --> 06:51.609
    There's too many people here
             right now.         

06:51.611 --> 06:53.111
              Let's go, Theresa.
        [DOORBELL RINGS]        

06:53.113 --> 06:54.112
 I'll get it!                   

06:54.114 --> 06:56.680
ARCHIE:                         
I want to eat, Edith!           

06:56.682 --> 06:58.116
             Hello, Mrs. Bunker.

06:58.118 --> 07:00.851
How do you do, Father?          
Can I help you?                 

07:00.853 --> 07:03.021
        It's me. Father Majeski.

07:03.023 --> 07:07.425
Father Majeski!                 
You grew a beard.               

07:07.427 --> 07:09.293
                  I know.       

07:10.795 --> 07:12.897
Well, come in.                  

07:12.899 --> 07:14.098
              Ah! There you are,
                    ladies.     

07:14.100 --> 07:15.900
            Frank told me       
    I'd find you both over here.

07:15.902 --> 07:16.934
                     Mr. Bunker.

07:16.936 --> 07:18.336
Look at all the Catholics.      

07:18.338 --> 07:21.639
     If we had Bing Crosby,     
     we could make a movie.     

07:24.809 --> 07:26.277
What's with the beard, Majeski? 

07:26.279 --> 07:28.812
    You trying to save          
        on razor blades?        

07:28.814 --> 07:33.884
    Archie, if the ignorant     
were blessed, you'd be a saint. 

07:33.886 --> 07:35.786
             Now, shall we go,  
                  ladies?       

07:35.788 --> 07:37.688
                  Wait a minute,
                    everybody.  

07:37.690 --> 07:39.690
    Wouldn't you like to have   
              some coffee?      

07:39.692 --> 07:41.492
Oh, no, no. No, thank you.      
We haven't time.                

07:41.494 --> 07:43.694
Oh, you're wearing              
St. Anne, I see.                

07:43.696 --> 07:46.497
          Yeah. That's my medal.
             Ain't it lovely?   

07:46.499 --> 07:48.399
                      Theresa   
                  gave it to me.

07:48.401 --> 07:50.401
                      You know, 
                    it's too bad

07:50.403 --> 07:53.637
          we don't have medals  
        like this in our church.

07:53.639 --> 07:57.275
Catholics have lots of things   
        that we don't have.     

07:57.277 --> 07:58.409
Well, we both have              

07:58.411 --> 08:00.178
the one thing that              
really matters, Mrs. Bunker.    

08:00.180 --> 08:04.115
        Yeah, and that's        
     the collection plate.      

08:04.117 --> 08:05.550
    I shouldn't think           

08:05.552 --> 08:07.351
    a collection plate          
  would matter to you, Archie,  

08:07.353 --> 08:10.054
 unless you were making change. 

08:19.098 --> 08:22.233
        Can we eat              
  now the pilgrimage is over?   

08:22.235 --> 08:24.034
        Come                    
    and get it!                 

08:24.036 --> 08:27.271
            Gloria got supper   
                for us tonight. 

08:27.273 --> 08:29.006
                It's a surprise.

08:29.008 --> 08:30.575
          Gloria, huh?          

08:30.577 --> 08:33.578
  Gee, then it must be either   
Chinks or Colonel Sanders.      

08:33.580 --> 08:35.946
No, Arch.                       
It's steaks.                    

08:35.948 --> 08:38.948
             Steak? What are you
                 doing to me?   

08:38.951 --> 08:41.919
  Edith, you know I can't afford
    steak nowadays on my dough. 

08:41.921 --> 08:43.587
                Look at that.   
                  New York cuts.

08:43.590 --> 08:46.757
      No, Arch, those are       
        New Jersey cuts.        

08:49.995 --> 08:53.297
    Uh, Daddy, Ma didn't buy    
     the dinner. It's our treat.

08:53.299 --> 08:56.967
 Oh, the little girl bought them
      out of her wages, huh?    

08:56.969 --> 08:58.936
             Well, in that case,
                 whoop-de-do.   

08:58.938 --> 09:00.538
                Dig in there.   

09:00.540 --> 09:01.839
                        Yeah.   
                     [CHUCKLING]

09:01.841 --> 09:03.608
        How was your day, Ma?   

09:03.610 --> 09:04.942
Oh, lovely.                     

09:04.944 --> 09:09.980
Irene took me to St. Patrick's  
Cathedral in Manhattan          

09:09.982 --> 09:12.883
and the organist                
was practicing.                 

09:12.885 --> 09:18.055
It was just like a concert, only
we couldn't clap at the end.    

09:20.392 --> 09:23.261
  Hey, hey. Hold your horses.   

09:30.402 --> 09:32.203
            What was you doing  
         in St. Pat's Cathedral?

09:32.205 --> 09:33.837
                  You ain't even
                    a Catholic. 

09:33.839 --> 09:37.642
Oh, it was all right, Archie,   
because Irene is a member.      

09:37.644 --> 09:40.811
        Yeah. What's all this   
          Catholic stuff anyway?

09:40.813 --> 09:43.147
    Look at the medal           
     dangling off you there     

09:43.149 --> 09:45.816
          like you was          
     a mother superiority.      

09:47.186 --> 09:48.752
Gee, Ma,                        
that's lovely.                  

09:48.754 --> 09:50.288
                  It's St. Anne.

09:50.290 --> 09:53.023
                Theresa said    
        she's a patron saint.   

09:53.025 --> 09:54.024
Of what, Ma?                    

09:54.026 --> 09:57.127
          Of dingbats.          

09:57.129 --> 10:00.164
      Archie, St. Anne is       
 the patron saint of housewives 

10:00.166 --> 10:01.165
      and women in labor.       

10:03.768 --> 10:09.740
    Oh, my. I hope you don't    
have to be in labor to wear it. 

10:11.376 --> 10:13.110
                    You don't   
                have to be that,

10:13.112 --> 10:15.979
but you've got to be Catholic   
    to wear it, which you ain't.

10:15.981 --> 10:17.281
                  You ain't yet 
                 explained to me

10:17.283 --> 10:18.816
    what's all the attraction   
          with the Catholics.   

10:18.818 --> 10:22.486
Oh, they have lots              
of interesting things           

10:22.488 --> 10:25.923
like those little confessionals 
      right in the church.      

10:25.925 --> 10:30.328
          They're like          
    telephone booths to God.    

10:30.330 --> 10:33.331
Hey, Ma, that very poetic.      

10:33.333 --> 10:34.932
  The hell's poetic about it?   

10:34.934 --> 10:37.335
  I didn't hear nothing rhyme.  

10:37.337 --> 10:39.870

a lovely day,                   

10:39.872 --> 10:43.407

to this lovely dinner.

10:47.447 --> 10:49.547
  I certainly do, little girl.  
        It's delicious.         

10:49.549 --> 10:53.384

  whipped up a winner tonight.

better myself, Arch.            

11:05.196 --> 11:08.098

is delicious.                   

11:08.100 --> 11:11.269
I ain't never seen              
meat so lean.                   

11:11.271 --> 11:13.036
What kind is it?                

11:13.038 --> 11:15.773
             It's steak, Ede.   
         It's steak. It's steak.

11:15.775 --> 11:18.008
Yeah, I know,                   
but what kind?                  

11:18.010 --> 11:19.510

11:39.898 --> 11:41.999

      your mother-in-law?       

11:42.001 --> 11:44.535
Nothing that hasn't gotten      
      into you too, Arch.       

11:48.973 --> 11:52.310
                 Ma, why are you
                    so upset?   

11:53.445 --> 11:56.847
I keep thinking                 
of Mr. Ed.                      

12:00.585 --> 12:04.689
              But Ma-- Ma, we're
              not eating Mr. Ed.

12:04.691 --> 12:05.989

         the rest of the world's
          been eating for years.

12:07.794 --> 12:10.594
    You've seen people lining up
for it on the news, remember?   

12:10.596 --> 12:13.564
I know, Gloria.                 
But horse!                      

12:13.566 --> 12:16.099
People ride horses.             

12:16.101 --> 12:19.337

        Ma, it's no different   
            from eating chicken.

12:22.542 --> 12:26.877
But the queen                   
don't ride a chicken.

because I was enjoying it.

19:26.899 --> 19:29.800
Oh, yeah, and it was            
a beautiful service.            

19:29.802 --> 19:33.470
I came out of the church        
feeling like a new woman.       

19:33.472 --> 19:37.207
             Holy cow! You mean 
            you done it already?

19:37.209 --> 19:38.242
Done what, Archie?              

19:38.244 --> 19:39.676
         Ohhh! Gee, look at you.

19:39.678 --> 19:41.879
    You wouldn't even know      
what you done if you done it.   

19:41.881 --> 19:45.048
    Did you get on your knees   
and kiss anybody's ring tonight?

19:45.050 --> 19:46.416
What?                           

19:46.418 --> 19:49.486
     Did any guy take a stick   
  and splash water all over you?

19:49.488 --> 19:51.855
        No.                     

19:51.857 --> 19:54.291
                     Did you eat
                      a cookie? 

20:01.732 --> 20:02.966
        No.                     

20:02.968 --> 20:06.003
All I had all evening           
was ice cream.                  

20:06.005 --> 20:09.139
                  What, are they
                 using that now?

20:09.141 --> 20:11.541
    Oh, Archie, that's dumb,    
         even for you.          

20:11.543 --> 20:13.310
          Listen, Irene, this is
              all your fault.   

20:13.312 --> 20:16.546
 No, I didn't have the ice cream
        in church, Archie.      

20:16.548 --> 20:19.116
            Irene and me stopped
              on the way home.  

20:19.118 --> 20:21.685
That's all?                     
                        Yeah.   

20:21.687 --> 20:22.986
You didn't do nothing           
besides that?                   

20:22.988 --> 20:24.288
                             No.

20:24.290 --> 20:27.490
     Well, then, thank God      
I got you in time, Irene.       

20:27.492 --> 20:28.926
Now, what is that               
supposed to mean?               

20:28.928 --> 20:29.927
Listen, I ain't going to        

20:29.929 --> 20:31.528
beat around the brush           
with you no more.               

20:31.530 --> 20:34.497
I want you to stop trying to    
make my wife into a Catholic.   

20:34.499 --> 20:37.000
  Are you trying to accuse me   
    of proselytizing?           

20:43.407 --> 20:45.876
            Why? No!            

20:47.879 --> 20:52.382
     Arch, Irene means that     
she's not trying to convert Ma. 

20:52.384 --> 20:53.984
 No one's talking to you there, 
        big mouth.              

20:53.986 --> 20:57.187
Edith, come over here.          
Come over here!                 

20:58.923 --> 21:00.824
I got one word                  
to say to you                   

21:00.826 --> 21:02.226
and one word only.              

21:02.228 --> 21:05.495
You ain't never going to        
turn Catholic. That's it.       

21:05.497 --> 21:07.430
                     Oh, Archie.

21:07.432 --> 21:10.433
          You know I would never
                 do that.       

21:10.435 --> 21:14.637
I just wanted to learn something
     about Irene's religion.    

21:14.639 --> 21:17.007
                 That don't mean
                 I'm gonna join.

21:17.009 --> 21:19.642
Well, it certainly looked       
as if you was.                  

21:19.644 --> 21:23.080
          Archie, Edith doesn't 
         have to join our church

21:23.082 --> 21:25.349
    to find out what religion   
             is all about.      

21:25.351 --> 21:27.417
  She learned a long time ago   

21:27.419 --> 21:32.055
that the important thing in life
    is to love other people.    

21:32.057 --> 21:33.690
     Irene, that's the best     
     definition of religion     

21:33.692 --> 21:35.025
        I've ever heard.        

21:35.027 --> 21:39.529
Oh, listen to the atheist over  
here, shooting his mouth off!   

21:39.531 --> 21:41.131
What the hell do you know       
about religion?                 

21:41.133 --> 21:43.767
      Arch, I know that the most
        important thing in life 

21:43.769 --> 21:44.935
                  is to love    
                 other people.  

21:44.937 --> 21:46.036
Baloney!                        

21:46.038 --> 21:47.837
            I happen to feel    
    that you can achieve that   

21:47.839 --> 21:49.106
            without bringing God
                  into it,      

21:49.108 --> 21:50.807
      but if that's Irene's way,
             I respect it.      

21:50.809 --> 21:52.409
            At least we're going
        for the same results.   

21:52.411 --> 21:57.547
The only result I ever seen     
you going for was the icebox.   

21:57.549 --> 21:58.748
Mike, you may be                
an atheist,                     

21:58.750 --> 22:01.184
but that was a very             
Christian thing to say.         

22:01.186 --> 22:02.286
                      Thank you,
                        Irene.  

22:02.288 --> 22:04.321
Oh, listen to the Catholic      
        and the atheist         

22:04.323 --> 22:06.523
  agreeing with each other and  
patting each other on the back. 

22:06.525 --> 22:09.126
I can't stand it no more.       
Get away from me, all of youse! 

22:09.128 --> 22:11.161
    Edith, it was               
     a lovely evening.          

22:11.163 --> 22:12.262
              Good night,       
                 kids.          

22:12.264 --> 22:13.263
                     Good night,
                        Irene.  

22:13.265 --> 22:14.932
      Arrivederci, Irene.       

22:14.934 --> 22:19.102
 Archie, I don't like comparing 
     your church with mine,     

22:19.104 --> 22:22.639
but there is one big difference 
that makes me very happy.       

22:22.641 --> 22:24.674
    Yeah, what's that?          

22:24.676 --> 22:27.844
 The Protestants have got you.  

22:36.520 --> 22:38.655
      Every time you bring      
  that woman into this house,   

22:38.657 --> 22:40.190
      she gives me a shot.      

22:40.192 --> 22:42.025
          Oh, Archie.           

22:42.027 --> 22:46.063
I'm sorry                       
you worried about me.           

22:46.065 --> 22:49.166
  I don't want to hear one other
    word about the whole thing. 

22:49.168 --> 22:52.970
    Only from now on, you let   
 Irene Lorenzo stick to her God,

22:52.972 --> 22:54.604
        and we'll stick to ours.

22:54.606 --> 22:59.042
But there's only one,           
I always thought.               

22:59.044 --> 23:02.279
         Let me do the thinking.

23:04.615 --> 23:07.817
You just do the useful things   
            around here         

23:07.819 --> 23:11.121
         like, er, for instance,
              get me a beer.    

23:11.123 --> 23:13.490
                 Sure.          
              Right away.       

23:13.492 --> 23:16.293
    Oh, would you like          
        a snack with it?        

23:16.295 --> 23:17.694
          Yeah, yeah.           
    A snack would be great.     

23:17.696 --> 23:18.895
    Make me a up a sandwich     

23:18.897 --> 23:20.397
out of the leftover steak       
          from supper.          

23:25.203 --> 23:28.038
  Are you sure you want that?   

23:28.040 --> 23:31.041
         Sure I'm sure.         
    It was delicious.           

23:31.043 --> 23:33.010
        Coming right up.        

23:33.012 --> 23:37.280
 Daddy, how can you be so hungry
 when you ate so much at dinner?

23:37.282 --> 23:39.549
  Yeah, it's funny, ain't it?   

23:39.551 --> 23:41.918
          I don't know          
  what's come over me tonight.  

23:41.920 --> 23:44.821
          I feel like           
      I could eat a horse.      

23:57.668 --> 23:58.668
                 Hi, honey.     

23:58.670 --> 23:59.869
            Hi, Ma.             
        How was church?         

23:59.871 --> 24:02.705
    Oh, it was fine.            

24:02.707 --> 24:05.409
                 But something  
                funny happened. 

24:05.411 --> 24:07.044
             Right after        
             the service        

24:07.046 --> 24:10.947
the Reverend Felcher            
took me aside to talk to me.    

24:10.949 --> 24:13.716
He's worried                    
about you, Archie.              

24:17.422 --> 24:20.757
      Why? Because I don't      
hang around his church like you?

24:20.759 --> 24:25.495
No, he found out that           
you went to see Father Majeski, 

24:25.497 --> 24:28.665
and he's afraid you're          
gonna turn Catholic!
