01:36.333 --> 01:41.167
No matter how troublesome a marriage is,
it's still called holy matrimony.

01:41.458 --> 01:45.583
Everyone has their own reason
to get married.

01:46.042 --> 01:49.167
Some get married so that
their mothers can get some rest,

01:49.250 --> 01:51.792
but it's the daughters-in-law who rest.

01:52.250 --> 01:55.208
Some get married for entertainment.

01:55.458 --> 01:59.458
And then, there are some
who never walk this path.

01:59.583 --> 02:03.375
But even then, marriage finds a way
of crossing their path.

02:04.667 --> 02:07.958
One such person is Kumar Shivram Kishan.

02:09.500 --> 02:13.792
Don't assume he is single
just because he is smiling.

02:20.417 --> 02:21.792
He too is married.

02:22.208 --> 02:25.542
He didn't get married once, but thrice.

02:26.042 --> 02:30.500
But without his consent.
It was a year ago.

02:30.833 --> 02:33.542
So, let's have a look
at the first accident.

02:51.292 --> 02:52.417
I am fine.

02:52.583 --> 02:54.500
My father is in the hospital.
He is in a serious condition.

02:54.750 --> 02:56.167
I was bringing these medicines for him.

03:01.625 --> 03:03.042
Don't worry. Come with me.

03:13.208 --> 03:14.333
Your daughter is here.

03:25.708 --> 03:28.083
Your medicines are here, uncle.
Now, you will get well soon.

03:28.833 --> 03:30.958
Now I'll have no concerns,
even if something happens to me.

03:31.625 --> 03:34.875
I had just one concern:
That before I died,

03:34.958 --> 03:39.417
-I'd get her married to a suitable boy.
-Yes.

03:40.667 --> 03:41.833
Anyway...

03:43.000 --> 03:44.083
Yes?

03:48.708 --> 03:51.208
-Take care of her.
-What?

03:53.458 --> 03:56.292
Hello? Uncle? Brother? Hello? Uncle?

03:57.958 --> 04:00.167
-Now he won't say anything.
-He can at least hear me, right?

04:00.292 --> 04:02.000
Hello? Uncle?

04:04.083 --> 04:06.792
How can he die just like that?
He was alive just a minute ago.

04:10.667 --> 04:14.000
He was a fortunate one,
to die after getting his daughter settled.

04:14.375 --> 04:16.708
-Settled? Who got settled?
-Yes, son.

04:16.917 --> 04:20.292
-You have fulfilled a dying man's wish.
-I didn't do anything.

04:20.417 --> 04:24.417
Look, he left with a smile.
You are a great son.

04:24.542 --> 04:25.542
Here's the wedding token!

04:26.167 --> 04:28.208
Come on, everyone.
Give him your tokens as well.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.250
As wedding gifts, he got:

04:34.333 --> 04:40.625
45 rupees, two bananas, 2.5 oranges
a few coins and a bottle of saline.

04:44.083 --> 04:47.292
There's a saying: "Once bitten twice shy."

04:47.500 --> 04:50.875
But when a bad omen is onto you,
even an ant can kill you.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.792
But Shivram Kishan was always fond of
getting married.

04:56.500 --> 04:58.500
He went to his friend Ballu's wedding.

05:00.375 --> 05:02.792
-How much does she give in a year?
-What?

05:02.958 --> 05:05.083
I mean how many marriages
does she attend in a season?

05:05.208 --> 05:08.375
Sir, she is a very lucky mare.
The one who touches her gets married.

05:09.833 --> 05:11.292
Her name is the Runaway Mare.

05:11.375 --> 05:13.667
No. I don't want to get married.
My friend Ballu is getting married.

05:13.833 --> 05:14.792
Okay. No problem.

05:14.917 --> 05:16.750
He always used to say
that he would settle down in Canada.

05:16.833 --> 05:18.167
But he didn't have enough money.

05:18.250 --> 05:21.083
Then I advised him to get married
and settle down here.

05:21.167 --> 05:22.125
Close to his own people.

05:22.292 --> 05:24.333
And look, he is getting is married today.

05:25.708 --> 05:26.583
What happened, Jojo?

05:26.667 --> 05:27.958
-There is a big problem.
-What happened?

05:28.042 --> 05:30.042
My brother Ballu was drink driving.

05:30.250 --> 05:32.583
-The police arrested him.
-So, what do we do now?

05:32.667 --> 05:34.417
Now only you can save me from defamation.

05:34.542 --> 05:37.833
-Wear this festoon and get on the mare.
-But how can I take Ballu's place?

05:37.958 --> 05:40.167
I am not asking you to get married.
It's just for a while.

05:40.583 --> 05:43.833
I'll bail that idiot out before
you guys reach the bride's house.

05:44.208 --> 05:47.333
-Please. Please, I beg of you.
-You don't need to beg, but...

05:48.667 --> 05:50.292
But... be there on time.

05:50.625 --> 05:52.667
I will go like this,
and I will keep going.

05:55.208 --> 05:56.708
Go slow. Are you the one getting married?

05:56.833 --> 05:58.833
-What's the rush?
-No problem. We will go slowly.

06:02.458 --> 06:03.958
Buddy,
I've reached the bride's house already.

06:04.042 --> 06:05.000
When are you guys coming?

06:05.125 --> 06:06.792
We are just leaving the police station.

06:07.125 --> 06:08.083
Hurry up.

06:09.042 --> 06:10.833
Ballu, have you switched off
your mobile phone?

06:10.917 --> 06:12.542
-Yes, brother.
-Come on, get in. Hurry up.

06:12.917 --> 06:13.958
To the airport, brother.

06:14.458 --> 06:16.625
It's time for the wedding vows.
Get the bride.

06:16.833 --> 06:17.708
I'll get her right away.

06:20.167 --> 06:22.167
Oh, God. They are getting ready
for the vows.

06:22.583 --> 06:24.000
Why is his phone switched off?

06:26.292 --> 06:27.875
Sir, start walking around the fire.

06:28.500 --> 06:30.250
Hold on, can I just talk to you
for a second?

06:30.708 --> 06:31.625
Hurry up.

06:33.083 --> 06:34.833
Look, we cannot get married.

06:37.667 --> 06:40.000
-Why?
-Look at me.

06:41.958 --> 06:44.333
-Aren't you surprised?
-Why would I be surprised?

06:44.500 --> 06:47.708
-Because I am not Ballu.
-I know. You are Ballu's friend.

06:47.792 --> 06:49.375
Exactly,
you were supposed to be getting married

06:49.458 --> 06:52.000
-to Ballu, right?
-Ballu had shown me your photo.

06:52.500 --> 06:54.875
I liked you as soon as I saw your photo.

06:55.167 --> 06:57.583
-Ballu showed you my photo?
-Yes.

06:58.042 --> 07:03.042
And the 50 lakhs you needed
for your business were sent by us.

07:03.500 --> 07:05.208
-Fifty lakhs?
-Yes.

07:05.625 --> 07:08.458
Ballu! So, the rascal's off to Canada.

07:08.708 --> 07:11.833
Look, I have been tricked.
I cannot get married.

07:12.167 --> 07:13.292
What are you saying?

07:14.500 --> 07:15.500
All the guests are here.

07:15.917 --> 07:17.875
Then find a suitable one among the guests
and get married.

07:17.958 --> 07:20.708
But I cannot get married to you. Look,
I have already been through one tragedy.

07:21.417 --> 07:23.083
I am the one
who has gone through a tragedy.

07:24.417 --> 07:25.458
I am a model...

07:26.875 --> 07:30.292
and while walking on the catwalk
all my clothes came off, accidentally.

07:30.583 --> 07:32.333
Because of that I have faced
a lot of humiliation.

07:32.583 --> 07:34.500
My marriage
has already been called off thrice.

07:34.917 --> 07:36.292
Please don't say that.

07:36.583 --> 07:40.292
If you don't marry me, I will jump
into this fire and kill myself.

07:40.500 --> 07:42.042
Look, I can understand your problem.

07:42.125 --> 07:43.667
But you too should try to understand
my problem.

07:43.958 --> 07:46.042
-You cannot marry me.
-No, I can't.

07:46.292 --> 07:47.958
But I can kill myself.

07:48.375 --> 07:49.333
Hey! Hello!

08:10.667 --> 08:12.250
Do something good
and get something bad in return.

08:12.333 --> 08:14.792
This is what has been happening
in Shivram's life.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.417
But in spite of that, he didn't change.

08:17.625 --> 08:22.917
So far, he had gone to help others.
This time someone came seeking his help.

08:23.083 --> 08:24.542
What could the poor guy do?

08:26.542 --> 08:29.333
Help! Please help me.
Those goons are after me.

08:29.625 --> 08:30.625
How can they be after you?

08:30.708 --> 08:33.083
Isn't there any law and order in the city?
Let's go, I'll see about it.

08:33.333 --> 08:35.708
-There are ten to 15 of them.
-Ten to 15! Hop on. Hurry up.

08:39.542 --> 08:40.792
-Let's follow them.
-Yes.

08:46.583 --> 08:49.708
-I ran away from my wedding.
-Who asked you to run away?

08:49.833 --> 08:52.292
They were making me marry someone else.

08:52.458 --> 08:54.792
It doesn't matter to me
to whom you get married.

08:54.917 --> 08:58.625
What are you saying, Anil?
You said you loved me.

08:58.708 --> 09:01.208
Because I didn't know you were
a Don's sister.

09:03.042 --> 09:04.958
Anil! Anil, please don't do that.

09:05.417 --> 09:08.500
Where will I go
if you didn't stand by me?

09:18.792 --> 09:20.250
Look, I don't know who you are.

09:21.333 --> 09:22.875
But please, don't cry.

09:23.958 --> 09:25.250
Everything happens for a reason.

09:28.292 --> 09:30.750
Hey, hello. Where are you going? Hey.

09:32.583 --> 09:34.125
What are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?

09:34.250 --> 09:37.042
-Get down. Get down!
-Just leave me. Let me die.

09:37.125 --> 09:39.292
-Have you lost your mind?
-Then what should I do?

09:40.917 --> 09:43.000
You want to die because a guy dumped you?

09:43.375 --> 09:45.000
This is the only reason you have
to die? Right?

09:45.125 --> 09:47.875
But have you ever thought
about the reasons to stay alive.

09:48.917 --> 09:50.875
You can live for the one
who is truly made for you.

09:51.250 --> 09:52.875
Who couldn't bear
to see tears in your eyes.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.083
Who holds your hand, and never lets it go.

09:55.417 --> 09:56.958
Come, let me take you home.

10:03.667 --> 10:06.208
-Let's go.
-Now how will I face everyone?

10:06.583 --> 10:08.750
My brother, he will kill me.

10:08.833 --> 10:11.333
He is your brother, not an executioner.
I will talk to him.

10:19.792 --> 10:21.458
-Tiger?
-Brother.

10:22.375 --> 10:24.583
-He is your brother?
-Yes.

10:26.292 --> 10:31.458
That's Tiger. The infamous don
of this city. The entire city fears him.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.750
He hates only one thing,
and that is dowry.

10:35.083 --> 10:37.667
He makes them pay hard,
those who demands dowry.

10:39.292 --> 10:40.792
Let go of my hand, please.

10:42.250 --> 10:43.292
Please.

10:52.625 --> 10:54.250
You made your brother see this day?

10:55.542 --> 10:56.458
Let's go home.

11:08.958 --> 11:11.083
Everyone in this city gets scared of me
and runs away.

11:12.375 --> 11:14.917
But when you ran away, I got scared.

11:16.667 --> 11:18.750
Is my anger more important
than your happiness?

11:20.500 --> 11:24.792
-I will do whatever you say.
-Yes, sir. That's what I was telling her.

11:24.875 --> 11:26.708
A brother would never want something bad
for his sister.

11:27.125 --> 11:29.833
On one hand you're her real brother
and on the other you are the big brother!

11:34.083 --> 11:37.625
Anjali, instead of running away
with the boy you like,

11:38.208 --> 11:40.167
-you need to settle down with him.
-Yes.

11:44.042 --> 11:45.833
-I like this boy.
-What?

11:51.000 --> 11:52.667
Tiger. Tiger.

11:53.167 --> 11:55.667
-Move aside! I want to talk to him.
-He doesn't listen to anyone.

11:55.750 --> 11:57.917
But he will have to listen to me,
otherwise I will be in trouble.

11:59.125 --> 12:03.000
-Tiger is deaf. How will he listen to him?
-Tiger, Look.

12:03.583 --> 12:05.750
I am not the boy for whom your sister
ran away from her wedding.

12:05.875 --> 12:08.292
Look, I was on the road
and your sister was running.

12:08.375 --> 12:11.167
And your goons,
your staff, were after her.

12:11.708 --> 12:15.833
So I thought I should save her from them.
I saved her from committing suicide.

12:16.042 --> 12:18.208
Please forgive me, sir.
I am a married man.

12:20.250 --> 12:21.708
Why are you entreating?

12:22.125 --> 12:24.583
I should be the one beseeching
when I marry my sister off.

12:24.875 --> 12:28.167
Sir, you didn't get me.
I already have two wives at home.

12:28.250 --> 12:30.125
Yes, you'll get married right here
in this mandap.

12:31.125 --> 12:37.208
-Like you, I too am in a hurry.
-Look sir, you are misunderstanding me.

12:37.417 --> 12:41.333
-I have nothing to do with your sister.
-You won't take dowry?

12:41.750 --> 12:44.542
That's so nice of you.
I too am completely against dowry.

12:45.167 --> 12:50.333
But remember one thing:
My sister shouldn't want for anything.

12:50.583 --> 12:53.875
Because here, there is only one sister,
but plenty of guns.

12:54.500 --> 12:56.167
Priest, you may begin.

13:05.958 --> 13:09.500
This is how Kumar Shivram
accidentally got married thrice.

13:23.875 --> 13:26.125
Don't ruin something
You've been maintaining

13:26.208 --> 13:28.333
This is what parents have always advised

13:30.625 --> 13:34.167
Pull your leg back and turn around

13:34.458 --> 13:39.083
The cat just crossed my path

13:39.167 --> 13:43.625
The cat just crossed my path

13:44.167 --> 13:46.417
I used to flirt
I used to chase skirts

13:46.542 --> 13:48.583
I used to take them out in my dad's car

13:48.708 --> 13:50.833
I was known as the dashing boy

13:50.958 --> 13:53.000
Then what?
Then I got married

13:53.083 --> 13:55.250
And not just once
It happened thrice

13:55.333 --> 13:57.583
I was bombarded from all four sides

13:57.667 --> 14:01.917
My good luck turned bad
God, this is cheating

14:02.333 --> 14:06.583
Because of others, I was heartbroken

14:06.667 --> 14:11.458
I let God decide upon my love story

14:31.833 --> 14:35.625
The cat just crossed my path

14:41.167 --> 14:44.583
Look God, this naive man got trapped

14:45.708 --> 14:49.042
Why was I snared with marriage?

14:50.125 --> 14:53.042
I am in tears
I am in tears

14:53.250 --> 14:55.875
I am in tears
While still laughing

14:56.042 --> 15:00.167
The cat just crossed my path

15:00.500 --> 15:04.708
The cat just crossed my path

15:21.792 --> 15:22.958
His wives brought him good luck.

15:23.042 --> 15:25.083
Today he has money
and a successful business.

15:25.375 --> 15:27.750
One thing he doesn't have is
peace of mind.

15:28.167 --> 15:30.958
To find that, he always comes to me.

15:32.958 --> 15:34.542
Look carefully at this man!

15:34.792 --> 15:39.417
This man who looks innocent
is married to three women.

15:39.500 --> 15:41.000
Just so his wives don't bump
into each other,

15:41.125 --> 15:46.083
he keeps one in Borivali,
one in Andheri and one in Bandra.

15:46.500 --> 15:51.417
He has also told them that he spends
one night at home and two on duty,

15:51.708 --> 15:55.292
so that he can spend
a day with each of them.

15:55.625 --> 15:58.667
Out of the fear of getting caught,
he has saved his wives’ numbers

15:58.875 --> 16:02.042
as Head office, Branch office
and Area office.

16:02.417 --> 16:04.625
The man, running three households,
and making excuses

16:04.833 --> 16:07.125
for running three offices,
is roaming around freely.

16:07.542 --> 16:10.375
-With cameraman Karan, it's me, myself.
-Are you done with your shooting?

16:11.500 --> 16:14.875
-I was just joking brother.
-My life is in a mess and you are joking.

16:15.667 --> 16:17.917
All my wives are okay
with me spending two nights at the office,

16:18.000 --> 16:20.458
but they want me to greet them
before going to the office.

16:20.667 --> 16:23.125
They want me to say bye to them.
All of them want a good morning kiss.

16:23.208 --> 16:26.500
Now for one kiss I have
to travel 30 kilometers.

16:26.583 --> 16:28.458
I am more like a local train
than a human now.

16:28.583 --> 16:30.792
I don't know who I should love.
How do I love them?

16:31.000 --> 16:33.458
If it's such a big problem for you,
keep them in one place.

16:33.708 --> 16:36.708
In one place? Who made you a lawyer?
You dimwit!

16:36.792 --> 16:38.625
If they even got a hint
of each other's existence,

16:38.750 --> 16:40.125
they would either kill each other or me.

16:40.208 --> 16:42.042
I am not asking you to keep them
in the same house.

16:42.125 --> 16:44.125
Keep them in the same building.
Keep them on different floors.

16:44.208 --> 16:46.417
They won't find out about each other
if they are on separate floors?

16:46.542 --> 16:49.000
-Do you know Jatin Matre?
-No. Why does he too have three wives?

16:49.250 --> 16:51.792
No. He is not that ill-fated.
He just has one wife.

16:52.042 --> 16:54.208
He lives on the same floor in the same
Bandra building as yours.

16:54.292 --> 16:55.292
-Really?
-Yes.

16:55.375 --> 16:58.208
When you don't know who lives
on your floor, in your building,

16:58.292 --> 17:00.625
then how will your wives find out
about who lives on different floors?

17:01.250 --> 17:02.250
It's not a bad idea.

17:02.750 --> 17:04.792
But it is not easy to get
three apartments in the same building.

17:05.125 --> 17:07.333
My love, this is Mumbai.
Everything is possible here.

17:07.667 --> 17:09.750
Look over there. Cocktail Tower.

17:09.917 --> 17:12.375
It's a new building, you can get
ten apartments, never mind three.

17:12.958 --> 17:16.042
Whoever made you a lawyer
did the right thing.

17:16.917 --> 17:19.583
Three wives on different floors
in the same building.

17:19.833 --> 17:21.583
-And you on the top floor.
-Me? Why?

17:21.667 --> 17:23.708
I will use you as an excuse
to meet the three of them.

17:23.792 --> 17:25.917
-No one will get suspicious.
-I am not getting any work as it is,

17:26.042 --> 17:28.458
-and you are making me spend more?
-I will bear it. Why are you being whiny?

17:29.542 --> 17:31.833
-Welcome to Cocktail Tower, my love.
-But I don't want to go there!

17:32.708 --> 17:36.625
Shivram Kishan took my advice,
and bought three flats in Cocktail Tower.

17:37.042 --> 17:39.625
Now let's see how peaceful his life gets.

17:42.875 --> 17:45.083
Two wives serve me
and this one makes me serve her.

17:45.167 --> 17:46.708
Anyway, whatever God's will is!

17:49.083 --> 17:50.583
Simran, I am going to be late.

17:51.208 --> 17:53.375
You take more time to bathe once
than I take in a year.

17:53.708 --> 17:56.125
You will wither one day. The tea is also--

18:23.458 --> 18:25.417
Sweetie, you make it difficult
for me to go to the office.

18:26.542 --> 18:28.125
Then why do you leave me?

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
Come on, Shiv.
At least be a little romantic.

18:32.500 --> 18:35.417
-A little becomes a lot for me.
-Meaning?

18:35.500 --> 18:37.542
Meaning, you give me a lot of love,
little by little.

18:38.042 --> 18:39.083
Now what do I tell you?

18:39.625 --> 18:43.083
I'm the one who's gonna tell you.
It's just a trailer.

18:45.875 --> 18:49.792
-Bai!
-Say bye when I let you go.

18:50.083 --> 18:52.625
Our maid. Behind you.

18:58.250 --> 19:00.292
Champa, can't you knock before entering?

19:01.208 --> 19:02.708
Can't you do it with the door locked?

19:07.500 --> 19:10.500
-First, clean the bedroom.
-No, I will clean the kitchen first.

19:10.583 --> 19:13.708
The bedroom takes a lot of time.
It's always very dirty.

19:24.958 --> 19:26.250
Sorry, it fell.

19:27.083 --> 19:28.542
Anyway, it was old.

19:30.583 --> 19:33.583
Forget it sweetie. I don't think
Champa is in a good mood today.

19:33.875 --> 19:37.375
Some other time.
Anyway, you are always in the mood.

19:37.500 --> 19:38.958
I'll go meet Karan and then leave. Okay?

19:43.417 --> 19:44.417
Rude!

20:00.417 --> 20:02.417
What is this, sweetheart?
You are always playing video games.

20:02.625 --> 20:05.458
Then what else should I do?
You don't have time for me.

20:05.667 --> 20:07.958
Have you bought
such a big house just for me?

20:08.042 --> 20:10.167
Of course not, sweetheart.
It's for both of us.

20:10.583 --> 20:12.333
We are together only for one night.

20:12.583 --> 20:14.292
You are on duty for the other two nights.

20:14.375 --> 20:16.667
Duty is just an excuse. Actually,
I spend them with my wife.

20:17.167 --> 20:18.125
What?

20:18.583 --> 20:21.542
I mean, I am always thinking about you.

20:26.125 --> 20:28.958
Don't you think there should be a child
in this house?

20:29.125 --> 20:31.833
-Whose child will we bring?
-Not someone else's child.

20:32.083 --> 20:34.083
-I am talking about my child.
-I see.

20:34.958 --> 20:37.167
I really wish to play with kids.

20:37.250 --> 20:39.167
You want to play with kids
despite being a grown up?

20:39.250 --> 20:41.250
You don't understand anything. Forget it.

20:41.875 --> 20:45.167
I'd be better off spending my time
with ladies of this society.

20:45.417 --> 20:47.708
Have you lost your mind? You want
to meet the ladies of this society?

20:47.833 --> 20:49.708
Here no one meets anyone.
No one disturbs anyone.

20:49.792 --> 20:50.708
That's why I have come here.

20:50.792 --> 20:52.292
You know what happened
in that adjoining building?

20:52.375 --> 20:53.292
A woman came to sell soaps.

20:53.375 --> 20:55.542
She hit someone on the head with a stick
and stole all their jewelry.

20:55.625 --> 20:56.833
You better stay away from the women.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.458
Actually, I don't want anyone
to come between us.

21:03.708 --> 21:05.708
You are so possessive about me.

21:06.458 --> 21:09.708
-That I am, baby. I love you too.
-I love you.

21:12.042 --> 21:13.333
Can I go now?

21:14.958 --> 21:16.500
Okay then, I'll get going.

21:18.750 --> 21:22.042
-Okay then, I'll get going now.
-Fine, go.

21:35.708 --> 21:37.833
Now you show up?
I have been waiting for you for so long.

21:37.917 --> 21:40.042
Can't help it, darling.
First the head office, then branch office,

21:40.125 --> 21:41.125
and now the area office.

21:42.417 --> 21:43.625
I will go there after I meet you.

21:45.750 --> 21:48.917
You work so hard.
And still you take such good care of me.

21:49.375 --> 21:51.333
I pray everyone gets a husband like you.

21:52.708 --> 21:54.167
Check out breakfast!

21:54.500 --> 21:56.583
Wow. Sweet porridge, fried bread
with chickpeas. My favorite.

21:56.750 --> 21:57.625
Where did you order from?

21:58.917 --> 22:01.333
I haven't ordered it from a hotel.
I made it.

22:01.583 --> 22:04.833
-You?
-Yeah. It's not like we have a maid.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.125
Don't worry, darling.
I will get a nice maid for you.

22:07.250 --> 22:08.833
But the way, what's the occasion?

22:09.917 --> 22:11.500
You forgot? It's been a year today.

22:13.583 --> 22:16.000
Oh, God. How can I forget?

22:16.417 --> 22:19.167
It's been a year since we got married.
Happy anniversary, darling--

22:19.250 --> 22:22.750
No. I haven't made it for our anniversary.
It's for Papa's death anniversary.

22:23.708 --> 22:26.000
He left this world on this day.

22:26.583 --> 22:29.625
Yes, there is not much difference
in his death anniversary and my marriage.

22:29.792 --> 22:32.750
-He departed, and I got stuck.
-What?

22:32.833 --> 22:37.292
-He was a nice man. I am missing him.
-Wait. First feed Papa.

22:38.917 --> 22:40.458
Yes, I have hung his photo.

22:40.625 --> 22:41.750
Look, over there.

22:45.750 --> 22:46.708
How is it?

22:48.292 --> 22:49.667
It looks like he is laughing at me.

22:51.167 --> 22:53.750
-Should I go feed him?
-Yes. I'll go and get water.

22:57.625 --> 22:58.667
You...

22:59.792 --> 23:01.750
You are laughing
with your eight-inch-long teeth!

23:02.000 --> 23:03.875
If you would've waited
for another five minutes on that day,

23:03.958 --> 23:05.208
I would've escaped this fate.

23:05.292 --> 23:07.875
But no, you put her hand in mine
and departed!

23:08.958 --> 23:11.500
You didn't give your daughter to me,
you made my life...

23:12.000 --> 23:13.083
Now what do I tell you?

23:13.458 --> 23:16.458
You messed up my life
and you'll eat bhailpori?

23:16.833 --> 23:18.500
-Right, old man?
-"Right, old man?"

23:19.250 --> 23:22.083
Cute old man. Such old men
are hard to find in the market.

23:22.292 --> 23:23.250
Again, old man?

23:24.292 --> 23:26.333
You feed papa. I am leaving. Okay?

23:26.875 --> 23:30.500
-But at least eat Papa's sacrament food.
-I'll eat in the evening, darling. Bye.

23:30.958 --> 23:34.125
I already have too much in my plate,
and she wants me to eat that.

24:23.250 --> 24:24.958
THERE IS ONE OWNER OF ALL

24:31.625 --> 24:33.750
Don't be surprised yet!

24:34.208 --> 24:37.958
Apart from these forced wives,
Shivram Kishan also has a girlfriend.

24:38.250 --> 24:40.708
Deepika. She is very religious.

25:11.042 --> 25:14.542
Glory to Lord Shiva
Glory to Him

25:14.917 --> 25:18.250
We will get high on weed and have some fun

25:18.833 --> 25:21.708
Glory to Lord Shiva
Glory to Him

25:22.500 --> 25:25.708
We will get high on weed and have some fun

25:25.833 --> 25:29.958
It's Friday, let's not make it a dry day

25:30.125 --> 25:33.542
Let's wear sexy clothes
And hit a club today

25:34.000 --> 25:37.417
Let's get high on weed
And blow our worries away

25:37.542 --> 25:41.042
Good girls and boys, don’t go home
On Friday nights

25:41.125 --> 25:46.667
Say glory to Him, glory to Lord Shiva
Say glory to Him

25:46.750 --> 25:48.792
Glory to Lord Shiva

25:49.333 --> 25:53.958
We dance to loud music
Say glory to Him

25:54.375 --> 25:59.792
Glory to Lord Shiva, say glory to Him
Glory to Lord Shiva

26:00.000 --> 26:04.667
I have had something intoxicating
The world looks fascinating

26:05.083 --> 26:10.542
Because it's Friday today
On the floor, we made a lot of noise

26:11.042 --> 26:15.250
And bounce a bit more
Because it's Friday today

26:15.417 --> 26:19.083
Say glory to Him
Glory to Lord Shiva

26:19.250 --> 26:22.833
Say glory to Him
Glory to Lord Shiva

26:23.458 --> 26:27.083
Glory to Him
Glory to Lord Shiva

26:27.292 --> 26:30.708
We will get high on weed and have some fun

26:32.417 --> 26:35.875
We will take my papa's Lamborghini car

26:36.292 --> 26:39.708
And some money borrowed from some bugger

26:40.083 --> 26:43.625
We will spend the night in the bar

26:43.708 --> 26:47.417
We don't care about a hangover or a fever

26:47.750 --> 26:52.833
When the smoke touched my lips
My brain became blank

26:52.917 --> 26:58.167
Friday got to my mind
I feel no shame, to hell with others

26:58.333 --> 27:02.625
My hair has become a mess
Because it's Friday today

27:02.708 --> 27:06.250
Say glory to Him
Glory to Lord Shiva

27:06.667 --> 27:10.917
Say glory to Him
Glory to Lord Shiva

27:14.417 --> 27:16.417
Glory to Him

27:18.333 --> 27:23.875
Slow is your heartbeat
Sweetheart, you are high on weed

27:23.958 --> 27:29.625
Baby, I am crazy for you
Sweetheart, I am the one you need

27:29.708 --> 27:34.417
Plead with me and make me your beloved
We will find the shore together

27:34.708 --> 27:37.083
Because it's Friday today

27:37.167 --> 27:42.333
Don't be sad, you are tall and I am short
I will convince your daddy

27:42.458 --> 27:44.625
Because it's Friday today

27:44.792 --> 27:48.292
Say glory to Him
Glory to Lord Shiva

27:48.625 --> 27:52.292
We will get high on weed and have some fun

27:52.583 --> 27:56.250
Say glory to Him
Glory to Lord Shiva

27:56.333 --> 28:00.167
We will get high on weed and have some fun

28:05.375 --> 28:07.333
Do you have any idea
how much I missed you?

28:07.667 --> 28:09.958
You haven't missed me!
I came back from London after a year,

28:10.042 --> 28:11.792
and you didn't even come
to receive me at the airport.

28:11.875 --> 28:13.750
Deepu, now what do I tell you?
Work always keeps me busy.

28:13.833 --> 28:15.875
You know I opened three offices
in the past year.

28:16.542 --> 28:20.708
Wow Kumar! That's great news, right?
Dad too will be very pleased to see them.

28:20.792 --> 28:23.042
No, my offices are not worth showing
to your dad.

28:23.167 --> 28:24.958
-What do you mean?
-Your dad is a business tycoon.

28:25.042 --> 28:26.792
My three offices are nothing
compared to his business.

28:26.875 --> 28:29.708
I want you to have ten offices,
not just three.

28:29.792 --> 28:32.333
-For God's sake. Please, don't say that.
-Why?

28:32.708 --> 28:34.708
Then how will I spend time
with you, Deepu?

28:35.833 --> 28:39.417
I don't just need your time.
I need your companionship for a lifetime.

28:40.125 --> 28:44.458
You know, God has already given me a lot
without me even asking for it.

28:45.208 --> 28:48.333
But if there is anything
I have asked God for myself, that is you.

28:51.708 --> 28:54.667
-When are you coming to meet my dad?
-I will meet him anytime you want.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.042
Not anytime, today. Right now.

28:57.167 --> 28:59.958
Do one thing.
First show him a good photo of me.

29:00.083 --> 29:04.458
If he rejects my photo,
I'll go meet him personally.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.333
Baby, the thing is,
it's not nice to take insults in person.

29:07.583 --> 29:09.542
Don't take my father lightly.

29:09.792 --> 29:11.625
He has a very different philosophy
of life.

29:16.625 --> 29:19.500
Serene Appearance, Serpent,
Lotus on His Navel and Lord of the Devas.

29:19.792 --> 29:22.792
-Have you brought your documents?
-Yes, sir. Here are my documents.

29:23.167 --> 29:25.500
Your degree is fine. Have you brought
your life partner's photograph?

29:26.000 --> 29:28.250
-No, sir. I don't have her photo.
-That's what is important.

29:28.625 --> 29:29.833
My boss lives by the principle that

29:29.917 --> 29:31.542
character comes first,
and education afterwards.

29:31.833 --> 29:34.500
Here, each employee's desk should contain
his or her life partner's photo.

29:34.875 --> 29:36.417
-Understood?
-Yes, sir.

29:36.500 --> 29:38.333
Go and get your life partner's photo.

29:40.083 --> 29:41.958
-Have you brought his photo?
-Yes sir, I have.

29:42.125 --> 29:44.333
Okay, you wait.
Sir is praying, he'll call you.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.750
-Is Dad inside?
-Yes. He is praying.

29:46.917 --> 29:48.000
Husband of Devi Lakshmi,

29:48.167 --> 29:51.167
whose eyes are like lotus and
attainable to the Yogis by meditation.

29:51.292 --> 29:52.333
Color is like a cloud,

29:52.417 --> 29:54.500
who has a beautiful and auspicious body,
husband of Devi Lakshmi...

29:54.583 --> 29:56.460
Dad, I have to go to my rehearsals.
I am getting late.

29:56.575 --> 29:58.367
I have to get prepared
for the Ladies Club rehearsal.

30:01.833 --> 30:03.667
I am keeping Kumar's photo on the desk.

30:04.333 --> 30:07.250
If you have time to spare,
you can have a look at it.

30:11.708 --> 30:12.667
Yes, tell--

30:13.667 --> 30:15.833
Hey, she left.

30:16.708 --> 30:17.750
Oh, no.

30:18.833 --> 30:21.042
-Stop Deepika.
-She left, sir.

30:22.417 --> 30:24.542
Sir, candidates are here
for the interview. Shall I send them in?

30:24.625 --> 30:25.750
Yes, send them in.

30:27.417 --> 30:29.167
She got angry once again.

30:41.292 --> 30:45.125
You asked me to get my fiancé's photo.
So I--

30:46.125 --> 30:47.333
Sorry, sir.

30:49.125 --> 30:52.333
Here you go, sir.
I am going to get married to him.

30:52.750 --> 30:55.917
-What does he do?
-He works at a security agency, sir.

30:56.667 --> 30:58.958
Are you sure he is the one
you are going to get married to?

30:59.042 --> 31:00.250
Yes, sir.

31:01.625 --> 31:03.958
Fine.
Take it and keep it on your desk.

31:04.583 --> 31:06.958
Listen, if you change the photo,
you will also have to change your job.

31:07.042 --> 31:09.333
-Remember that.
-No, sir. The photo won't change.

31:11.500 --> 31:13.750
Thank you, Vicky.
I got the job because of you.

31:16.625 --> 31:17.542
Who is he?

31:18.875 --> 31:21.708
If you change the photo,
you will also have to change your job.

31:21.792 --> 31:22.708
Remember that.

31:24.167 --> 31:27.875
No. The photo won't change.
No matter what happens.

31:44.542 --> 31:47.333
Deepu! Hey sweetie.

31:47.583 --> 31:50.500
-Sweetheart. Baby.
-Uncle,

31:50.750 --> 31:53.917
Uncle, it's shameful for a man of your age
to tease a girl.

31:54.167 --> 31:55.458
Come here.

31:57.167 --> 31:58.292
She is my daughter.

32:00.833 --> 32:02.250
Sweetie!

32:04.542 --> 32:06.500
How much longer will you make me run?

32:06.792 --> 32:08.958
You should have stayed
for two more minutes.

32:09.042 --> 32:11.667
-I was just about to finish my prayer.
-Two minutes?

32:12.333 --> 32:14.167
You pray for two hours.

32:14.250 --> 32:16.417
I don't understand what you ask for
for so long.

32:16.833 --> 32:19.875
I ask for your happiness from God.
What else can I ask for, dear?

32:19.958 --> 32:20.833
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

32:21.375 --> 32:24.125
-So, did you see the photograph?
-I see God's photograph every day.

32:24.458 --> 32:27.292
Not God's, Kumar's photograph.

32:27.375 --> 32:30.500
-You didn't see it, did you?
-No, I didn't. Sorry, dear.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.292
What will I know from the photograph?

32:32.833 --> 32:35.458
Do one thing,
invite him to our house tomorrow.

32:35.708 --> 32:36.750
We will meet face to face.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.667
-Are you sure?
-Sure.

32:53.708 --> 32:55.500
There is a call from the inquiry office.

32:56.292 --> 32:59.250
-Now which is this fourth office?
-Don't answer it. I'll take it.

33:01.958 --> 33:04.917
You came running
as if it's your girlfriend's call

33:05.000 --> 33:06.208
and you don't want me to answer it.

33:06.292 --> 33:09.125
This is the problem with you women.
You can't think about anything but love.

33:09.458 --> 33:11.458
-Can you do me a favor?
-What?

33:11.542 --> 33:12.667
Will you get my clothes?

33:13.875 --> 33:15.250
My clothes. From the wardrobe.

33:16.792 --> 33:17.792
Here's your phone.

33:21.708 --> 33:23.292
You take so long to answer your phone.

33:23.708 --> 33:26.458
-I was busy with work.
-Forget about work.

33:28.042 --> 33:31.958
-Dad wants to meet you in the evening.
-In the evening? Okay. I will be there.

33:32.958 --> 33:34.625
Hey, how can you just say bye?

33:34.917 --> 33:37.292
I gave you such good news.
Won't you even give me a kiss?

33:39.167 --> 33:40.417
I won't hang up otherwise.

33:41.417 --> 33:42.500
Give me a kiss.

33:48.792 --> 33:51.708
-Who were you kissing on the phone?
-I was kissing my phone.

33:52.417 --> 33:54.500
You should kiss it as well.
I have got a very big assignment.

33:55.375 --> 33:56.292
Yes.

33:56.917 --> 33:58.625
This is called black magic.

33:58.708 --> 34:01.625
I got a black dress for you
and you got the assignment.

34:03.458 --> 34:06.792
Anyway, you look very hot in this dress.

34:14.833 --> 34:17.083
Champa, you always come at the wrong time.

34:17.167 --> 34:20.042
-Change your timings.
-You should change your timings.

34:20.167 --> 34:21.833
This is the only time that suits me.

34:25.167 --> 34:27.167
Shall I go and put on this black magic?

34:33.417 --> 34:36.042
Champa, start coming
an hour later.

34:36.417 --> 34:38.458
I will pay you 500 rupees extra.

34:38.583 --> 34:42.417
I will give you a thousand rupees
if you finally manage to kiss him.

34:45.042 --> 34:46.125
This maid!

34:46.583 --> 34:47.583
Hi, sweetheart.

34:49.833 --> 34:51.000
Look who is here.

34:53.792 --> 34:55.625
-Why is he here?
-What do you mean by why?

34:55.708 --> 34:58.458
When did he come? Brother!
Hello, Tiger.

34:58.958 --> 35:00.792
-Tiger.
-Welcome.

35:01.250 --> 35:02.292
Long time no see!

35:03.125 --> 35:04.458
Your face has shrunken.

35:04.667 --> 35:06.333
-Have you been running?
-No, brother.

35:06.417 --> 35:08.958
I just keep going up and down
the stairs so--

35:09.042 --> 35:12.167
You don't need to ask.
You are my brother-in-law.

35:13.542 --> 35:14.750
I will give you whatever you want.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.625
I wasn't asking for anything.
I was just saying--

35:16.708 --> 35:18.208
I am not going to listen to you.

35:19.083 --> 35:21.750
I am thinking of buying him
Sachin Tendulkar's music album.

35:22.042 --> 35:24.542
-But Sachin doesn't sing.
-And he doesn't listen.

35:25.500 --> 35:27.750
Don't fight, you two!
Look what I've brought for you.

35:29.417 --> 35:30.958
Don't you think
it's a little too small for us?

35:31.292 --> 35:35.333
Shut up. It's not for us,
but for our future child.

35:35.708 --> 35:38.417
I am the only uncle,
but I have a lot of desires.

35:38.667 --> 35:41.292
He wants to hear a child's squeal
in the house.

35:41.500 --> 35:43.250
He wants to hear a child's laughter echo
in this house?

35:43.333 --> 35:45.208
He's never listened
to the child's father to date.

35:45.375 --> 35:47.583
The pickle? It's home-made. It's nice.

35:48.750 --> 35:50.125
Make him hear the squeal.

35:50.250 --> 35:52.958
-You are always--
-I am joking with you, sweetheart.

35:53.792 --> 35:57.292
Anjali, get him something to eat.
In the meanwhile, we will talk.

35:57.542 --> 35:59.000
Sure, brother. I will get it right away.

35:59.583 --> 36:00.750
-Have a seat.
-Okay.

36:01.708 --> 36:03.875
-What's up?
-I'll tell you what's up.

36:04.875 --> 36:09.000
You will be infested with worms.
You made me marry your sister at gunpoint.

36:10.917 --> 36:13.250
You know there is no difference
between you and the old man downstairs.

36:13.667 --> 36:15.750
-He eats sweets while laughing...
-Yes.

36:15.833 --> 36:17.833
...and here you are eating savory
food while laughing. Right?

36:17.958 --> 36:20.583
I am done eating. I am on a diet as it is.

36:20.667 --> 36:21.875
-You are on a diet.
-Yes.

36:21.958 --> 36:25.042
Why are you alive?
So many diseases get spread every year.

36:25.125 --> 36:26.667
-Get yourself infected with one and die?
-Yes.

36:26.792 --> 36:29.417
You know because of you
I have three wives.

36:30.042 --> 36:33.792
No, not three,
you should only have two children.

36:34.875 --> 36:36.667
-Oh, God.
-Look, he is blushing now.

36:36.750 --> 36:38.583
He talks a lot. He's so funny.

36:39.292 --> 36:42.042
-Don't you guys tell him that he is deaf?
-He knows.

36:42.167 --> 36:44.875
But he doesn't want to show others
that he is deaf.

36:45.458 --> 36:47.542
-I see!
-Don't worry.

36:47.875 --> 36:49.917
Soon this house will be filled
with happiness.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.833
-God listens to everyone.
-God does listen, I know.

36:53.083 --> 36:55.375
You don't need to accompany me,
I will manage on my own.

36:55.458 --> 36:58.208
-Okay? Bye, Anjali.
-Bye, brother.

36:58.958 --> 37:00.958
Since when is he deaf?

37:01.250 --> 37:04.125
Actually, once he was cleaning his ears
with his gun,

37:04.292 --> 37:05.583
and he fired accidentally.

37:06.583 --> 37:09.708
The doctor managed to save his life,
but he couldn't save his hearing ability.

37:09.792 --> 37:11.208
Why are you crying?

37:13.208 --> 37:15.542
I ruined your shirt.
Go and quickly change it.

37:15.625 --> 37:17.583
Yes. No. Why? Why change? I will clean it.

37:17.667 --> 37:19.542
-Why not? Come with me.
-I will clean it.

37:19.625 --> 37:21.167
I will get into trouble if I change.

37:22.958 --> 37:26.125
This is looking so nice. And look,
it's matching my dress as well.

37:26.208 --> 37:27.875
True. But what will I tell the one above.

37:27.958 --> 37:29.792
-The one above?
-God!

37:29.875 --> 37:31.375
How will I face him
when he questions me

37:31.458 --> 37:33.875
for being negligent to such a lovely wife?

37:33.958 --> 37:35.042
How will I face him then?

37:38.167 --> 37:41.542
Tell God, that you haven't given me
your time but your whole life.

37:41.792 --> 37:42.667
Yes.

37:43.583 --> 37:45.125
Let me go. Stop hugging me, Anjali.

37:45.208 --> 37:47.500
-Anjali?
-Geetanjali.

37:47.750 --> 37:48.833
But I heard you say Anjali.

37:48.917 --> 37:50.625
The Geeta stayed inside
and only Anjali came out.

37:50.708 --> 37:53.333
It happens, sometimes.
Well, I was thinking,

37:53.417 --> 37:55.125
should we go shopping at Geetanjali?

37:56.083 --> 37:58.375
I thought for the first time you said
my name, and you said it wrong.

37:58.458 --> 38:00.292
See, I made a mistake
as soon as I took a name.

38:00.417 --> 38:02.917
That's why I affectionately call you
darling, sweetie, sweetheart.

38:04.125 --> 38:07.583
-I pray everyone gets a husband like you.
-Don't say such things, baby.

38:07.917 --> 38:09.667
God does answer one’s prayers sometimes.

38:19.750 --> 38:22.167
-Yes. What's troubling you now?
-I am in trouble buddy.

38:22.542 --> 38:24.917
Anjali made me change the shirt
which Simran made me wear.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.333
Now I am getting out of the building.

38:26.417 --> 38:28.042
If Simran sees me,
she will start suspecting.

38:28.125 --> 38:29.333
Please take care of it.

38:29.417 --> 38:31.500
-Hey, hello. Listen to me.
-Take care of it!

38:31.958 --> 38:33.167
But what should I--

39:00.542 --> 39:02.292
-How did Shiv's clothes get changed?
-Sister-in-law!

39:02.375 --> 39:05.000
Sister-in-law, give me the papers.
I will get them attested.

39:05.125 --> 39:06.000
Forget that.

39:06.125 --> 39:09.792
First tell me, Shiv left
the house wearing a black shirt.

39:10.167 --> 39:13.083
And now when I saw him downstairs,
he was wearing a blue shirt.

39:13.208 --> 39:15.333
You mean the black shirt
appeared blue to you?

39:15.583 --> 39:17.750
What do you mean by appear? It was blue.

39:18.583 --> 39:21.917
No, sister-in-law. It happens.
You must have studied it in science.

39:22.958 --> 39:25.417
-No.
-Superb. Now you can get it much better.

39:25.500 --> 39:28.000
The sky is black in color, right?

39:28.083 --> 39:31.167
But because of the sun's ultraviolet rays
it appears blue to us.

39:31.500 --> 39:35.333
-It happens because of the distance.
-But the distance wasn't that much, Karan.

39:35.417 --> 39:37.875
I say there shouldn't be any distance
between you and Ram.

39:37.958 --> 39:39.208
Not Ram, Shiv.

39:40.542 --> 39:44.250
Shiv. Ram. Kishan. All are the same.
There is no distance between you two.

39:44.333 --> 39:46.958
Where there is no distance, there is love.
Where there is love, there is acceptance.

39:47.042 --> 39:48.917
Where there is acceptance,
there is no place for suspicion.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.083
So, give me the papers sister-in-law.
I have to get them attested.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.083
Fine.

40:00.833 --> 40:03.333
See Champa,
sister-in-law doesn't understand science.

40:03.417 --> 40:06.292
-Did you understand?
-I got it.

40:06.375 --> 40:09.542
But Mrs. Gupta didn't.

40:09.792 --> 40:11.917
Once the same thing
happened to Mr. Gupta.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.500
-So she threw it down!
-The shirt?

40:13.583 --> 40:15.083
No, Mr. Gupta!

40:15.833 --> 40:19.250
See, Mr. Gupta would've survived
if his wife could understand science.

40:22.208 --> 40:24.042
Science is very important.

40:36.917 --> 40:39.250
What happened, Dad?
Why are you staring at him?

40:39.667 --> 40:43.208
I think I have seen him somewhere.
Where did I see him?

40:43.458 --> 40:47.167
Dad, he runs such a big business
at such a young age.

40:47.333 --> 40:49.208
You must have seen his photo
in a business magazine.

40:49.500 --> 40:52.417
Yes, correct. I have seen his photo. Yes.

40:53.125 --> 40:54.750
Where did I see his photo?

40:57.458 --> 41:00.667
-Are you married?
-What are you talking about, sir?

41:00.750 --> 41:03.292
Marriage? I never got married,
even a little bit!

41:07.667 --> 41:10.250
Young men these days are always so tense.

41:10.625 --> 41:12.333
They look married
despite of being single.

41:12.875 --> 41:16.792
Don't worry. You are my future son-in-law.
I like him a lot.

41:21.042 --> 41:24.792
Back in our time, girls used to blush
when they heard about marriage.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.792
And sir, nowadays they don't feel shy
even after running away from home.

41:37.167 --> 41:39.125
I like him a lot.

41:40.417 --> 41:44.083
Here, have some sweets.
Deepak’s dad approved me.

41:44.292 --> 41:46.417
Congratulations.
Now your funeral is confirmed.

41:46.875 --> 41:48.208
Not funeral, you idiot. The fourth one.

41:48.583 --> 41:50.917
You are happy as if you’re getting married
for the first time.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.250
Yes, it is my first to happen willingly.
The others were--

41:54.208 --> 41:55.125
Mother?

41:56.125 --> 41:58.958
-Greetings!
-Bholu. God bless you, son.

41:59.042 --> 42:01.042
-How are you?
-I am fine. How are you?

42:01.167 --> 42:02.833
How can I be fine?

42:03.292 --> 42:05.875
It's been a year since you got married.

42:06.250 --> 42:08.458
When will you bring my daughter-in-law
to the village?

42:08.542 --> 42:10.833
Mother, I'll come as soon as I can spare
some time from work.

42:11.083 --> 42:15.250
If you cannot come with her
then at least send me her photograph.

42:15.542 --> 42:17.917
If you don't send her photo this time,

42:18.208 --> 42:21.667
then I'll come there and bring her
to our village with me.

42:21.750 --> 42:24.250
Take her away, Mother. At least then
one of my problems will go away.

42:24.458 --> 42:26.792
Idiot, you are referring
to your wife as trouble?

42:27.917 --> 42:34.292
Remember, never break a woman's heart,
and never ruin a family.

42:34.375 --> 42:36.167
I haven't, Mother.
You can ask anyone you want to.

42:36.292 --> 42:39.667
Who do I ask?
That idiot also stays with you.

42:39.833 --> 42:41.625
-He is right here.
-Say hi.

42:41.708 --> 42:44.292
-He says hi.
-May God bless him.

42:44.583 --> 42:46.250
Mother wants you to take poison and die.

42:46.708 --> 42:48.875
-What?
-No, mother. I am just joking.

42:50.500 --> 42:53.583
Fine. Send her photo
as soon as you are free.

42:53.917 --> 42:55.125
Okay, mother. I will send it.

42:55.208 --> 42:57.208
Take care of yourself.
Okay, bye. Love you.

42:59.792 --> 43:01.625
-What happened?
-Mother wants my wife's photograph.

43:01.750 --> 43:03.583
So send it.
Send a photo of any one of the three.

43:03.917 --> 43:06.875
A few days ago, Father called.
He said he wanted my wife's photo.

43:07.042 --> 43:09.417
The problem is, I don't remember
whose photo I had sent him.

43:09.500 --> 43:11.833
So what difference does it make?
Your parents live separately, anyways.

43:11.917 --> 43:12.958
They got divorced 15 years ago.

43:13.042 --> 43:14.750
Send anyone's photograph.
It won't make a difference.

43:14.875 --> 43:17.125
Whose photo shall I send?
Anjali's or Juhi's?

43:17.875 --> 43:21.208
-Simran is too much for a village.
-Send Juhi's.

43:21.500 --> 43:23.333
I should send Juhi's?
Mother will like her.

43:44.583 --> 43:46.333
I see you cycling here every day.

43:46.792 --> 43:49.208
Oh, yeah.
And I see you jogging.

43:53.333 --> 43:54.333
Let's go.

43:55.042 --> 43:56.375
By the way, where do you live?

43:59.875 --> 44:01.333
I too live in Cocktail Tower.

44:06.958 --> 44:08.792
We live in the same building
and we just met each other.

44:08.917 --> 44:11.208
I know.
Actually my husband says,

44:11.292 --> 44:13.667
in such big societies everyone
is busy doing their own thing.

44:13.792 --> 44:15.542
No one disturbs anyone.

44:15.667 --> 44:17.083
My husband says the same thing.

44:17.333 --> 44:19.417
Our husbands think alike.

44:19.625 --> 44:21.417
Then we should get them together some day.

44:21.500 --> 44:23.625
Now that we have met,
they too will have to meet.

44:24.125 --> 44:25.042
What will you have?

44:25.167 --> 44:26.708
I always have Indian gooseberry juice.

44:26.792 --> 44:28.417
One watermelon juice
and one Indian gooseberry juice.

44:28.500 --> 44:30.208
Sorry, madam.
The gooseberry juice just ran out.

44:30.333 --> 44:32.083
Ma'am here just had the last glass.

44:34.917 --> 44:36.708
You can have it.
I will have something else.

44:38.458 --> 44:40.708
I just heard you saying
that you always have this juice.

44:41.708 --> 44:42.583
Yes?

44:42.667 --> 44:44.500
One orange juice, please.
Give this one to her.

44:48.208 --> 44:50.625
-It feels so good to talk to both of you.
-Exactly.

44:50.917 --> 44:54.792
I wish we had met sooner.
I get so bored at home.

44:58.333 --> 45:00.375
But I have joined a ladies' club.

45:01.000 --> 45:04.417
In fact, there is an annual function
next week.

45:04.500 --> 45:07.083
It is going to be a very big event.
I am telling you, you should join it.

45:07.167 --> 45:09.083
You two should join it.
We will have a lot of fun.

45:09.167 --> 45:10.292
It will help us kill some time.

45:10.458 --> 45:12.208
And we will also get a chance
to meet each other.

45:22.458 --> 45:24.792
Sweetheart, why don't you go
and do it on the terrace?

45:37.917 --> 45:38.917
Oh, God.

45:44.292 --> 45:45.708
-Listen.
-Yes?

45:45.875 --> 45:48.458
How come your underwear
fell from upstairs?

45:49.792 --> 45:51.208
-Upstairs?
-Yes.

45:51.333 --> 45:52.917
It fell from one of the floors above ours.

45:53.250 --> 45:55.667
-How is that possible?
-That's what I am wondering.

45:55.958 --> 45:59.083
How can your underwear fall
from someone else's house?

45:59.167 --> 46:01.125
I am not the only one who wears underwear
in this building.

46:01.208 --> 46:03.083
Someone else can also wear the same brand.

46:03.167 --> 46:04.250
Yes, I know.

46:04.333 --> 46:07.292
That's why I embroidered a star
on all your underwear.

46:07.583 --> 46:09.792
-What?
-Yes. Here, look at this.

46:10.750 --> 46:11.750
Here it is!

46:12.292 --> 46:14.083
Why did you have to show your talent
on the underwear?

46:14.250 --> 46:15.292
Forget that.

46:15.375 --> 46:17.583
First tell me how it fell
from one of the floors above ours.

46:18.000 --> 46:19.500
I don't know.
You should have been more careful.

46:19.583 --> 46:20.917
You remember your father's
death anniversary,

46:21.000 --> 46:22.542
but you are unaware
of your husband's underwear.

46:22.625 --> 46:23.833
-Father's death anniversary?
-Yes.

46:23.917 --> 46:25.792
-Whose father's death anniversary?
-Whose--

46:25.875 --> 46:27.625
If you had one
you would have remembered, right?

46:27.792 --> 46:28.958
You want to play with kids,

46:29.042 --> 46:30.667
but you don't know
what my underwear is playing at.

46:30.750 --> 46:32.667
-And you want to play with kids.
-What are you saying?

46:32.750 --> 46:34.583
-"What are you saying?"
-Madam.

46:37.667 --> 46:39.917
Madam,
my boss's underwear fell down.

46:40.042 --> 46:41.917
This underwear belongs
to the owner of this house.

46:42.208 --> 46:43.333
No, it belongs to my sir.

46:43.625 --> 46:45.917
Hey, wouldn't I recognize
my husband's underwear?

46:46.083 --> 46:48.125
And wouldn't I recognize
my boss's underwear?

46:48.250 --> 46:49.667
I take it off every day.

46:50.417 --> 46:52.417
-What?
-Yes. If I wash it and dry it,

46:52.500 --> 46:54.000
of course I take it off.

46:54.083 --> 46:56.167
As usual, I was taking it off,
and it fell down.

46:56.250 --> 46:58.458
-Now give it back.
-I told you, it belongs to my husband.

47:00.333 --> 47:03.625
Why are you looking the other way?
Tell her whose underwear it is.

47:03.917 --> 47:05.083
Tell her.

47:06.250 --> 47:07.417
-Sir!
-What sir?

47:07.500 --> 47:10.000
-It is mine.
-Yes, it is yours.

47:10.167 --> 47:12.375
It's mine, and I have taken it.
Now go away from here.

47:12.750 --> 47:14.833
-But sometimes you--
-Sometimes what? I wear it every day.

47:14.917 --> 47:16.333
Have you ever seen me
without underwear?

47:16.417 --> 47:17.417
-Oh, God.
-Why God?

47:17.500 --> 47:19.500
It's my underwear. I am taking it.
Now go away from here. Go.

47:20.292 --> 47:22.875
How did this happen? Oh, Lord.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.750
She's ruined my mood this morning.
Go and get a cup of coffee for me.

47:26.292 --> 47:27.250
Go.

47:31.583 --> 47:32.917
How do I tell her?

47:33.167 --> 47:36.208
Thank you so much, sister-in-law.
You took such good care of my underwear.

47:36.417 --> 47:39.292
Give my underwear to Ram.
I mean give my regards to Ram.

47:39.625 --> 47:43.292
Coffee? No. you have already made it?
Fine, then I will have some.

47:47.125 --> 47:48.042
She is a stupid maid.

47:48.125 --> 47:49.625
She doesn't recognize
her employer's underwear.

47:49.792 --> 47:52.125
-She is just his maid, not his wife.
-True.

47:52.208 --> 47:53.833
But I still don't understand,

47:54.000 --> 47:56.125
how did your underwear fall
from one of the floors above ours?

47:56.208 --> 47:58.917
Just as it fell from above,
it must have fallen down from here.

47:59.000 --> 48:03.708
The stupid maid must've taken it. It'll
fall again, and the cycle will go on.

48:03.958 --> 48:06.000
Don't try to think about that.
Think about this. Look at this.

48:06.083 --> 48:07.917
The marital fast. Heavy discount.

48:08.542 --> 48:11.583
Wow, discount.
You will come with me for shopping?

48:13.042 --> 48:15.250
I will buy four new sets
of underwear for you.

48:15.333 --> 48:16.750
-Sure.
-Throw this one away.

48:16.833 --> 48:19.208
I wonder who must have worn it.
Disgusting.

48:22.250 --> 48:23.625
When did sir go downstairs?

48:24.917 --> 48:26.708
What happened?
Why do you look so baffled?

48:26.792 --> 48:29.625
-Mr. Karan, I just don't understand.
-What is it that you don't understand?

48:30.125 --> 48:32.875
Look, I was taking off the clothes
from the terrace,

48:32.958 --> 48:34.833
and boss's underwear
slipped from my hands.

48:35.042 --> 48:36.708
I saw it landing on the sixth floor. Okay?

48:37.167 --> 48:40.125
When I went down there,
sir was already there.

48:42.542 --> 48:44.625
-He was already there?
-Yes.

48:44.708 --> 48:46.583
Champa, he was bound to be there.
Have you studied science?

48:46.667 --> 48:48.042
I never went to school.

48:48.125 --> 48:49.875
Superb,
then you will understand this even better.

48:50.083 --> 48:53.208
Scientist Newton said,
if you throw two things from a height,

48:53.292 --> 48:55.250
the one with more weight
reaches the bottom first.

48:55.417 --> 48:57.375
Now tell me what weighs more,
your sir or his underwear?

48:57.708 --> 48:59.292
-Sir.
-So who will reach the bottom first?

48:59.750 --> 49:01.375
-Sir.
-So you are so smart.

49:01.458 --> 49:02.583
Yet you look baffled.

49:02.667 --> 49:04.917
Don't tell your madam about this.
She will think that you are stupid.

49:05.000 --> 49:09.625
I am not that stupid. I know Newton.
I work at his place as well.

49:10.750 --> 49:11.708
-Okay, bye.
-Yes.

49:16.708 --> 49:19.625
You know, here there is an offer
of buy one and get two free.

49:19.708 --> 49:22.167
Really? There are many places
where you get three.

49:22.708 --> 49:23.583
Yes.

49:24.750 --> 49:25.875
Here you go.

49:26.500 --> 49:27.708
Thank God we became friends.

49:27.875 --> 49:29.750
Otherwise I would have to come
shopping alone.

49:31.167 --> 49:33.792
By the way,
your idea of shopping was great.

49:33.917 --> 49:36.500
And your idea of embroidering a star
on the underwear was mind blowing.

49:36.583 --> 49:37.458
Stop it.

49:37.542 --> 49:40.708
Why should I stop it?
When I wear tight pants,

49:40.875 --> 49:42.125
it gets imprinted on me.

50:00.792 --> 50:02.667
Let's also buy a watch.

50:02.792 --> 50:05.000
Who needs a watch, baby.
One's time should be bad.

50:08.000 --> 50:09.542
I want to buy lingerie.
Are you coming with me?

50:09.625 --> 50:11.000
No, I want to buy some bangles.

50:14.833 --> 50:16.500
-Sweetheart, listen.
-Yes?

50:16.917 --> 50:19.083
Nothing, go ahead,
I will go and get the trolley.

50:19.833 --> 50:21.208
You are just too much. Hurry up.

50:29.083 --> 50:30.125
Kishan!

50:31.458 --> 50:34.083
-Juhi, what are you doing here?
-I came here to shop.

50:34.167 --> 50:35.875
But how did you get the time
to visit a mall?

50:36.167 --> 50:39.083
I didn't get the time, I came here
with my boss for some work.

50:39.208 --> 50:42.083
You don't have time for your wife. And
you are visiting a mall with your boss?

50:42.167 --> 50:45.333
-Come shop with me.
-Shopping, no. Let's go this way instead.

50:45.417 --> 50:47.833
-Why over there?
-My boss is over there. He will get angry

50:47.958 --> 50:50.417
-if he sees you with me.
-Is he your boss or your wife?

50:50.625 --> 50:53.167
Nowadays, bosses don't think themselves
less than a wife, darling.

50:53.333 --> 50:54.750
Come, let's go there and shop.

50:54.833 --> 50:56.583
Over there
we don't have to fear anyone.

51:05.667 --> 51:07.333
If only your office people
would leave you alone.

51:07.458 --> 51:08.458
Give it to me.

51:08.542 --> 51:10.250
-I will tell them--
-I disconnected it.

51:10.875 --> 51:12.125
Why is he disconnecting my call?

51:12.250 --> 51:16.625
Look, you will get everything here.
Go and check it out. Go. Go. Go.

51:24.542 --> 51:26.833
-I need your help.
-Yes?

51:27.292 --> 51:29.708
Actually, I am here to buy clothes
for a newborn.

51:30.167 --> 51:33.750
But I have no idea
what kind of clothes suit babies.

51:34.333 --> 51:36.083
Everything suits well on babies.

51:36.375 --> 51:38.958
But just remember
that the material should be soft.

51:39.708 --> 51:42.292
Money is not a problem.
I have a lot of money.

51:42.375 --> 51:43.917
I just want the clothes to be good.

51:44.792 --> 51:49.250
Hold on, look over there.
That's the best brand for kids.

51:50.292 --> 51:53.792
I don't use credit cards.
I always deal with cash.

51:55.917 --> 51:58.167
I think you can't hear me properly.

51:58.917 --> 52:02.958
I mean yearning to hear a child's squeal.
I am making preparations for that.

52:03.375 --> 52:06.958
You don't understand-- hold on.
Let me call my husband.

52:07.125 --> 52:09.083
He will help you. Okay?
Have a look around.

52:09.583 --> 52:11.458
-Listen,
-Yes? Are you done? Shall we leave?

52:11.542 --> 52:12.625
Please help him.

52:12.708 --> 52:14.667
I am unable to help myself
and you want me to help others?

52:14.750 --> 52:16.292
It will take just two minutes.
Please help him.

52:17.250 --> 52:18.375
Excuse me?

52:22.667 --> 52:25.167
Strange. No one is ready to help me.

52:26.583 --> 52:27.958
-Let's go. Let's go from here.
-My bangles.

52:28.042 --> 52:30.292
They sell secondhand goods here. Let's go.
We won't buy anything from here.

52:30.375 --> 52:31.333
Secondhand things in a mall?

52:31.458 --> 52:33.667
Here it is, Mr. Gulabchand.
Please check it once.

52:41.333 --> 52:43.667
-Can you see properly?
-Are we shopping or jogging?

52:44.083 --> 52:45.625
I can see very clearly.

52:47.792 --> 52:49.958
I can see really very clearly.

52:54.417 --> 52:56.583
I will get into trouble
if my boss spots me.

53:00.167 --> 53:01.583
Oh, man! What's he doing over here?

53:03.417 --> 53:06.833
-What happened? Hey!
-I'll be back after having water, okay?

53:09.583 --> 53:12.333
Okay. So he is his boss.

53:12.958 --> 53:16.708
-Who was that guy with you?
-He was my husband.

53:16.917 --> 53:19.333
-Husband?
-He brought his wife here for shopping.

53:19.417 --> 53:21.917
-Do you have a problem with that?
-No, I don't have any problem.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.875
-But you stay happy, dear.
-How can I be happy?

53:25.125 --> 53:26.792
He doesn't come home for two days
because of you.

53:26.875 --> 53:29.792
-Because of me?
-You've given him four offices to handle.

53:30.042 --> 53:31.875
And then you also ask him
to accompany you to a mall.

53:31.958 --> 53:34.042
-When did I--
-You should come here with your wife.

53:34.125 --> 53:35.458
Not with my husband.

53:37.250 --> 53:38.750
-Move aside.
-I have a daughter.

53:40.083 --> 53:43.167
Fraud. He is already married.

53:43.500 --> 53:45.875
And he wants to marry
my daughter as well.

53:47.375 --> 53:48.667
-Sorry, sister.
-Sister!

53:48.750 --> 53:51.708
-Anjali sister. Where were you?
-Where was I?

53:51.792 --> 53:53.625
-Where did you go?
-You have been calling me.

53:53.708 --> 53:55.667
I have been disconnecting your calls.
Where have you been?

53:55.750 --> 53:58.458
I have been looking for you.
You had gone to take a trolley, right?

53:58.583 --> 54:00.250
I found a tractor instead.
I met my boss up there.

54:00.375 --> 54:01.667
-He made me go crazy.
-Your boss?

54:01.750 --> 54:03.583
-Yes.
-He doesn't leave you alone even here.

54:03.667 --> 54:05.958
Yes, and if he sees us here,
he will take me back to the office.

54:06.083 --> 54:07.208
Let's get out of here, quickly.

54:07.292 --> 54:10.917
-Are we shopping or running?
-The discounts will be over.

54:11.250 --> 54:12.292
I am so dead.

54:13.167 --> 54:14.458
He will not leave me alone here either.

54:17.417 --> 54:18.833
So he is your boss.

54:19.458 --> 54:21.333
He has made our lives miserable.

54:21.625 --> 54:22.708
I will teach him a lesson.

54:23.375 --> 54:26.667
Who was the guy,
you were just talking to you?

54:26.958 --> 54:30.125
He was my husband.
Do you have a problem with that?

54:30.208 --> 54:33.542
No, I don't have any problem.
But you are going to have a problem.

54:33.625 --> 54:35.917
-Do you know, he has two--
-Not two,

54:36.042 --> 54:37.417
he is handling four offices for you.

54:37.917 --> 54:40.583
Because of you he doesn't get to spend
any time with me.

54:40.833 --> 54:43.083
We have a crib at home but no child.

54:43.542 --> 54:45.208
Crib? Child?

54:45.542 --> 54:50.000
-I am--
-You are his boss. But I am his wife.

54:50.125 --> 54:52.417
I'm telling you tomorrow is Karva Chauth.

54:52.708 --> 54:56.375
If you don't send him home
before the moon rises, then I'll see you!

54:56.625 --> 54:58.625
Got it? Move aside now!

55:00.250 --> 55:03.167
The first one doesn't know
that he already has a second one.

55:03.583 --> 55:06.750
And the second one isn't aware
of the first one's existence.

55:10.458 --> 55:11.542
You!

55:12.208 --> 55:13.708
What are you doing over here?

55:15.833 --> 55:18.833
-You give a lot of surprises.
-Now I'll give what I get, darling.

55:19.083 --> 55:20.833
Look what I've bought for you.
How is this?

55:21.792 --> 55:24.417
-Is that my size?
-Size? It will fit one or the other.

55:24.500 --> 55:26.167
Look at the color, baby. The color.
How's the color?

55:26.750 --> 55:28.125
Forget that. Come with me.

55:28.250 --> 55:31.208
Let me show you what I have selected.
Come with me.

55:33.875 --> 55:36.083
Stay here. I will be right back.

55:51.125 --> 55:52.833
Where did that scoundrel go?

55:53.667 --> 55:55.083
He was here just a moment ago.

56:00.333 --> 56:04.542
I didn't do anything. I didn't do
anything. I didn't do anything.

56:05.583 --> 56:08.167
This girl pulled me inside.

56:08.458 --> 56:10.917
What do you mean by pulled you?
My husband was standing here.

56:12.458 --> 56:15.042
-So he is your husband as well?
-What do you mean by yours as well?

56:15.625 --> 56:17.458
Excuse me, what do you want, sir?

56:18.583 --> 56:20.667
-Oxygen.
-Then why are looking for it over here?

56:20.958 --> 56:22.042
Go outside.

56:29.667 --> 56:31.125
Three wives?

56:31.583 --> 56:34.125
It's better that my daughter stays single
for the rest of her life

56:34.458 --> 56:36.875
rather than marrying such a boy.

56:37.250 --> 56:40.417
Where is he?
Let me get hold of you just once!

56:40.500 --> 56:43.042
He will spend the Karva Chauth in prison.

56:46.167 --> 56:47.375
No. No, dear.

56:49.208 --> 56:50.542
Okay, take it.

56:55.292 --> 56:56.625
I will escort you outside.

57:03.417 --> 57:04.583
When is her birthday?

57:04.792 --> 57:06.125
Actually,
we came shopping for her birthday.

57:06.208 --> 57:08.375
Fourth wife? That too with a child?

57:08.750 --> 57:13.125
-We will cut the cake today.
-Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.

57:13.542 --> 57:14.917
She too is your wife, right?

57:15.125 --> 57:18.333
Excuse me. He is not my husband.
He is just helping me.

57:18.500 --> 57:20.625
You shouldn't have told the truth.

57:20.708 --> 57:22.792
You should have lied
like the other three did.

57:22.875 --> 57:25.458
The other three girls lied
because I asked them to,

57:25.542 --> 57:28.458
and we made him an April fool's joke.
You ruined it for me.

57:28.542 --> 57:30.583
Come, let me escort you outside.
April fool!

57:38.250 --> 57:40.875
That's good that he fooled you.

57:41.083 --> 57:42.125
But...

57:42.208 --> 57:44.792
You are suspicious about him, right?
That's why he did this to you.

57:45.375 --> 57:47.167
-But the entire mall--
-But what?

57:47.458 --> 57:51.125
How could you even think
that one man could marry three times?

57:52.167 --> 57:55.542
Stop laughing. Please. Stop laughing.
Stop laughing.

57:57.125 --> 58:00.917
The boy who can make an April fool
in the month of October,

58:01.083 --> 58:02.375
he can do anything.

58:03.000 --> 58:04.083
Stop laughing!

58:04.708 --> 58:05.958
Stop laughing.

58:44.292 --> 58:49.000
Not one, not two, but stuck between three

58:49.125 --> 58:53.375
My friends, I'm hanging by a thin thread

58:59.292 --> 59:04.875
The first one asks, where are you off to

59:05.375 --> 59:09.833
The second one says, answer the phone

59:09.958 --> 59:14.292
The third one's tension has made me sick

59:14.542 --> 59:18.875
My friends, I'm hanging by a thin thread

59:19.875 --> 59:24.875
My friends, I'm hanging by a thin thread

59:29.167 --> 59:32.625
Rascal, I am expressing my sorrow
and you are dancing? Sit down.

59:34.167 --> 59:35.083
Sit.

59:38.292 --> 59:39.917
You know what happened today?

59:41.708 --> 59:43.583
All my stumps were clean-bowled today.

59:45.083 --> 59:48.458
All three of my wives fought
with Deepika's father.

59:49.333 --> 59:52.250
But you know,
your brother still didn't give up.

59:53.667 --> 59:57.792
I took the fourth one in front of him
and said, "April fool."

59:59.208 --> 1:00:00.708
Brother, you are sloshed.

1:00:01.917 --> 1:00:03.750
So far, I've just had three.

1:00:04.833 --> 1:00:06.583
The fourth one is yet to come,
my brother.

1:00:11.167 --> 1:00:12.667
You know everything.

1:00:19.958 --> 1:00:21.375
You know everything.

1:00:35.958 --> 1:00:37.542
I got stuck.

1:00:39.292 --> 1:00:40.792
You know everything.

1:00:51.875 --> 1:00:54.417
One after the other, boss.
One after the other.

1:00:54.583 --> 1:00:59.000
I was attacked thrice.
The earth moved from under my feet.

1:01:01.583 --> 1:01:03.667
But I am still standing.

1:01:04.833 --> 1:01:10.042
-Do you understand? You know everything.
-I understand, my brother.

1:01:12.583 --> 1:01:13.792
What do you understand?

1:01:17.708 --> 1:01:19.125
What do you understand?

1:01:20.875 --> 1:01:22.875
Do you understand what happens
when Anjali changes the shirt

1:01:22.958 --> 1:01:25.250
Simran had made me wear?

1:01:27.708 --> 1:01:31.167
Do you understand what happens
if Juhi gets addressed as Anjali?

1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:34.333
You say you understand!

1:01:35.125 --> 1:01:36.417
He understands.

1:01:38.958 --> 1:01:40.708
Have you ever seen an embroidered star
on an underwear?

1:01:43.708 --> 1:01:46.417
She makes a star with a thick thread
on my underwear.

1:01:46.500 --> 1:01:48.583
When it pinches me here,

1:01:49.250 --> 1:01:52.542
I cannot tell the second one
what is pinching me,

1:01:52.625 --> 1:01:54.583
because it has been made by the first one.

1:01:56.750 --> 1:01:57.958
Do you understand?

1:01:59.542 --> 1:02:02.792
All three of them feed me affectionately.
I love that.

1:02:03.500 --> 1:02:04.958
It's love, emotions.

1:02:06.292 --> 1:02:07.292
But...

1:02:09.167 --> 1:02:13.458
but do you understand, all these emotions
are giving me an upset stomach?

1:02:18.375 --> 1:02:19.917
You only understand Newton.

1:02:21.875 --> 1:02:23.583
Call your Newton here.

1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:27.542
Call him here. Forget three,
get him married just twice.

1:02:27.833 --> 1:02:31.750
You can change my name
if your Newton doesn't go insane.

1:02:34.375 --> 1:02:35.542
He understands.

1:02:38.375 --> 1:02:39.583
Tomorrow is Karva Chauth.

1:02:40.958 --> 1:02:43.750
All three of them have said
that they want me home...

1:02:44.917 --> 1:02:46.542
before them when the moon rises...

1:02:51.833 --> 1:02:55.000
Ask, ask your uncle. What is his name?

1:02:55.292 --> 1:02:59.167
Ask Newton. Does he have any formula?

1:03:08.833 --> 1:03:10.083
Is there any science?

1:03:12.042 --> 1:03:13.417
He understands.

1:03:14.833 --> 1:03:16.000
Man...

1:03:18.875 --> 1:03:19.917
You know...

1:03:21.083 --> 1:03:22.208
You know...

1:03:24.792 --> 1:03:25.958
What do you know?

1:03:28.792 --> 1:03:30.542
But you know everything, Boss.

1:03:32.042 --> 1:03:35.000
You got me trapped in three marriages.

1:03:36.333 --> 1:03:38.500
Now you will get me out of this mess.

1:03:39.417 --> 1:03:41.417
You will make the moon rise.

1:03:42.042 --> 1:03:45.917
You will get me out of this mess as well.
Otherwise, I will be dead, Boss.

1:03:46.125 --> 1:03:49.333
Please save me.
I am like your younger brother.

1:03:49.917 --> 1:03:51.583
The one up above...

1:04:08.167 --> 1:04:13.375
All across the country married women,
are fasting for their husband's long life.

1:04:13.667 --> 1:04:17.917
Woman are all decked out already,
for the prayer at night.

1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:20.750
And as the dusk reproaches,
they all have gone to the roof tops,

1:04:20.875 --> 1:04:24.583
and near the windows of their homes.
Now they are waiting for the moon to rise.

1:04:24.958 --> 1:04:28.917
The moon rise is expected
in another half an hour.

1:05:35.375 --> 1:05:37.250
There is only half an hour left
for the moon to rise.

1:05:37.708 --> 1:05:40.083
How will you show your face to all of them
at the same time?

1:05:40.375 --> 1:05:41.750
Have you thought of something?

1:05:46.375 --> 1:05:47.375
I have.

1:05:48.542 --> 1:05:49.583
The moon will be seen...

1:05:51.167 --> 1:05:52.125
and so will I.

1:06:02.250 --> 1:06:05.000
You are waiting for me, right?
But I am not coming.

1:06:05.083 --> 1:06:06.000
-What?
-What?

1:06:06.083 --> 1:06:08.542
Your husband does everything
differently, sweetheart.

1:06:08.667 --> 1:06:11.958
As we got married in a different manner,
So shall be the Karva Chauth.

1:06:12.583 --> 1:06:15.083
The name you are hiding in your palm,

1:06:15.625 --> 1:06:17.625
come and look out from the terrace.

1:06:17.833 --> 1:06:20.250
He has brought the moon
in this palm for you.

1:07:34.833 --> 1:07:40.542
You are my Juliet, you are my body

1:07:40.792 --> 1:07:46.542
I am your Romeo, I am your raiment

1:07:48.708 --> 1:07:51.458
Let me be so close to you

1:07:51.667 --> 1:07:54.333
So that I can touch your soul

1:07:54.833 --> 1:07:59.333
Without you, I am non-existent

1:07:59.500 --> 1:08:05.167
I am the ocean, you are the shore

1:08:05.583 --> 1:08:11.375
If I stumble, you are my support

1:08:11.875 --> 1:08:15.167
-I am the ocean
-I am the ocean

1:08:15.250 --> 1:08:17.708
-You are the shore
-You are the shore

1:08:18.167 --> 1:08:21.125
-If I stumble
-If I stumble

1:08:21.292 --> 1:08:24.458
-You are my support
-You are my support

1:08:32.083 --> 1:08:37.750
My existence was meaningless
Then I met you

1:08:38.250 --> 1:08:43.458
You made my dreams come true

1:08:44.458 --> 1:08:50.000
You made me a part of your life

1:08:50.542 --> 1:08:54.917
You turned a drop into a river

1:08:55.292 --> 1:09:00.792
You are my Juliet
You are the one I speak through

1:09:01.375 --> 1:09:06.875
I am your Romeo
I am the words you speak

1:09:09.292 --> 1:09:14.583
Let me be so close to you
So that I can touch your soul too

1:09:15.167 --> 1:09:19.875
Without you, I am non-existent

1:09:19.958 --> 1:09:25.917
I am the ocean, you are the shore

1:09:26.125 --> 1:09:31.917
If I stumble, you are my support

1:09:38.542 --> 1:09:44.375
I was just a desert speck, you accepted me

1:09:44.792 --> 1:09:50.208
And I became valuable

1:09:50.458 --> 1:09:56.667
I shall never wake up, oh my love

1:09:57.167 --> 1:10:01.333
If I sleep in your arms

1:10:01.917 --> 1:10:07.542
You are my Juliet, you are my sight

1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:13.833
I am your Romeo, I am the one you look for

1:10:15.708 --> 1:10:21.708
Let me be so close to you,
So that I can touch your soul

1:10:22.083 --> 1:10:26.208
Without you, I am non-existent

1:10:26.667 --> 1:10:29.708
-I am the ocean
-I am the ocean

1:10:29.792 --> 1:10:32.833
-You are the shore
-You are the shore

1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:35.958
-If I stumble
-If I stumble

1:10:36.042 --> 1:10:39.375
-You are right beside me.
-You are right beside me.

1:11:02.792 --> 1:11:03.875
Listen.

1:11:06.167 --> 1:11:07.792
Where can I find Shivram Kishan?

1:11:07.917 --> 1:11:10.458
Go straight, to the right
there is a temple. He'll be there.

1:11:10.542 --> 1:11:12.583
Go and call him.
Tell him his father is here.

1:11:14.167 --> 1:11:16.958
Shall I call the God? Are you drunk?

1:11:17.542 --> 1:11:19.375
You are making fun of a senior citizen?

1:11:20.125 --> 1:11:21.917
Shivram Kishan is my son's name.

1:11:22.875 --> 1:11:26.250
Listen,
I don't like getting drunk.

1:11:26.833 --> 1:11:28.292
I drink to forget my sorrows.

1:11:28.875 --> 1:11:30.208
Rishi Kapoor said that.

1:11:30.292 --> 1:11:33.458
No, Rishi Kapoor didn't say that.
He was the hero of the film.

1:11:33.542 --> 1:11:34.875
Anand Bakshi said it.

1:11:34.958 --> 1:11:37.333
I listen to the radio 24/7.
I know everything.

1:11:38.417 --> 1:11:39.917
You remember the people
from the film industry,

1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:41.833
but you don't know
who lives in the building.

1:11:42.208 --> 1:11:43.292
Uncle...

1:11:43.375 --> 1:11:45.583
-You are a watchman.
-Why did he come here?

1:11:45.708 --> 1:11:48.625
You should know
who lives in this building.

1:11:48.708 --> 1:11:50.375
-Uncle,
-Sorry.

1:11:51.917 --> 1:11:53.792
-Karan!
-I seek your blessings.

1:11:54.042 --> 1:11:58.625
-God bless you Karan. How are you?
-I am absolutely fine.

1:11:59.042 --> 1:12:02.125
Tell me where in this labyrinth
does our Bholu live?

1:12:02.458 --> 1:12:03.667
Come with me.

1:12:05.417 --> 1:12:08.708
-What brings you here all of a sudden?
-It's not sudden, son.

1:12:08.833 --> 1:12:11.500
I've been planning to meet my son
and his wife for so long.

1:12:11.625 --> 1:12:14.250
So I came here today.
Come on, quickly take me to their house.

1:12:14.333 --> 1:12:17.750
House? Which house?
I mean which wife's photo had he sent you?

1:12:18.792 --> 1:12:21.167
Which wife? Does he have many?

1:12:21.583 --> 1:12:24.917
No. I mean which photo of his wife
did he send you?

1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:27.583
Actually,
the security of this place is very tight.

1:12:27.792 --> 1:12:30.000
You have to show
the owner's photo at the lift.

1:12:30.083 --> 1:12:31.583
Only then does it stop at that floor.

1:12:33.708 --> 1:12:34.875
I am telling the truth.

1:12:35.833 --> 1:12:36.875
Strange.

1:12:41.792 --> 1:12:43.167
This is the photo he has sent me.

1:12:44.875 --> 1:12:48.542
Sixth floor. Come with me.
Come, let's go.

1:12:58.542 --> 1:13:00.708
Even the army doesn't have
such tight security.

1:13:01.083 --> 1:13:02.958
This is how it is here.

1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:05.667
Son, will I need to show
the photo every day?

1:13:05.750 --> 1:13:09.083
No. Once it is logged into the system,
I mean stored,

1:13:09.333 --> 1:13:11.875
you just have to come
and press on the 6th floor button.

1:13:11.958 --> 1:13:14.292
If you press any other button,
the alarm will go off.

1:13:15.667 --> 1:13:16.667
Fine.

1:13:18.875 --> 1:13:22.875
We have made it. Your Bholu lives here.
And your new daughter-in-law.

1:13:25.250 --> 1:13:27.167
He changed his name
from Kumar Shivram Kishan to Ram Kumar?

1:13:27.583 --> 1:13:29.875
People make a big name in the city
and he has cut his name short.

1:13:30.125 --> 1:13:31.625
That's because he does great things,
uncle.

1:13:49.958 --> 1:13:51.958
-Yes, Karan?
-Your father is here.

1:13:52.083 --> 1:13:53.458
Father is here? Where is he?

1:13:53.708 --> 1:13:55.708
-He is here.
-Here where?

1:13:55.958 --> 1:13:57.875
Here, at your house, on the sixth floor.

1:13:58.125 --> 1:14:01.625
What? Father has come from the village.
Oh, my mother!

1:14:02.083 --> 1:14:03.500
Not your mother, your father is here.

1:14:04.083 --> 1:14:07.125
Mother is here too.
She is standing right before me.

1:14:09.250 --> 1:14:10.917
-What do I do now?
-What will you do?

1:14:11.625 --> 1:14:14.167
Do one thing.
You had sent her Juhi's photo, right?

1:14:14.250 --> 1:14:16.750
Quickly take her to the fourth floor.
Then we will decide what should we do.

1:14:17.625 --> 1:14:19.417
I will meet you in some time. Okay?

1:14:20.542 --> 1:14:22.625
Vishal, how do I know
where you can find fried bread?

1:14:23.250 --> 1:14:24.292
Mother!

1:14:26.208 --> 1:14:31.375
-Mother, I seek your blessing.
-My Bholu! Always be happy, son.

1:14:33.375 --> 1:14:35.125
-You have gained weight.
-Fat?

1:14:35.292 --> 1:14:36.917
-Yes,
-You are the first mother in this world

1:14:37.042 --> 1:14:38.208
to call her child fat.

1:14:38.292 --> 1:14:40.167
Usually all mothers say,
"you have lost weight."

1:14:40.292 --> 1:14:44.542
Son, I thought I should say something
different as I am in the city.

1:14:44.708 --> 1:14:47.833
Otherwise you will think
that your mother is orthodox.

1:14:47.958 --> 1:14:50.000
Okay. But, why did you come here
without informing me?

1:14:50.500 --> 1:14:52.750
-Why? Do you feel bad?
-Yes, of course.

1:14:52.875 --> 1:14:56.208
No, I mean if you would have informed me
I would have sent one or two.

1:14:56.542 --> 1:14:58.250
Sent one or two...
Where? Why? How?

1:14:58.542 --> 1:15:01.000
-What do you mean?
-My office staff. To receive you.

1:15:01.083 --> 1:15:04.542
-I know how busy you are.
-Yes, mother.

1:15:04.625 --> 1:15:06.500
That's why I came here
without informing you.

1:15:06.583 --> 1:15:07.792
Come on, introduce me to your wife.

1:15:07.875 --> 1:15:09.333
-You did the right thing.
-Come on, let's go.

1:15:09.417 --> 1:15:11.250
You did the right thing, mother.

1:15:11.875 --> 1:15:15.917
-Come.
-It's a big house.

1:15:16.292 --> 1:15:18.500
Juhi, look who is here.

1:15:19.708 --> 1:15:21.792
Why did you bring her?
Couldn't you find anyone younger?

1:15:21.875 --> 1:15:22.875
-Younger?
-Yes.

1:15:23.042 --> 1:15:24.917
What work will a maid of this age
be able to do?

1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:25.958
Maid?

1:15:26.042 --> 1:15:28.208
Not a maid, she is my mother.
Your mother-in-law.

1:15:28.333 --> 1:15:29.542
Come here and seek her blessings.

1:15:30.958 --> 1:15:33.208
Mother, I am sorry!

1:15:33.292 --> 1:15:35.542
-I am sorry, mother.
-God bless you, dear. God bless you.

1:15:36.167 --> 1:15:41.250
I know women in city
only wait for their maids.

1:15:41.625 --> 1:15:45.125
But dear, mothers and sisters,
too, pay a visit sometimes.

1:15:45.208 --> 1:15:49.667
-Wow. Well said, mother. You are amazing.
-Shut up. Go and bring my bags inside.

1:15:50.875 --> 1:15:52.583
But why didn't you inform us
that you are coming here?

1:15:52.917 --> 1:15:55.333
From where I am,
we only inform when someone dies.

1:15:55.542 --> 1:15:58.583
-Not when someone arrives.
-Father-in-law didn't come with you?

1:15:59.083 --> 1:16:02.167
Your father-in-law left 15 years ago.

1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:04.208
I am so sorry, mother.

1:16:04.500 --> 1:16:06.875
-I didn't know that father is no longer--
-He is alive.

1:16:07.125 --> 1:16:10.208
He is very much alive.
And he is having a lot of fun too.

1:16:10.792 --> 1:16:17.167
After he married a fair-skinned female
from Kashmir, we parted ways.

1:16:17.917 --> 1:16:20.917
But father,
why did you and mother separate?

1:16:21.125 --> 1:16:22.583
Now what do I say, dear?

1:16:23.042 --> 1:16:25.958
A breeze blew and a flower
fell off from stem.

1:16:26.167 --> 1:16:30.458
It's neither the fault of the breeze
nor the garden. Who is to blame?

1:16:31.417 --> 1:16:34.000
-I don't get it.
-Let me explain sister-in-law.

1:16:34.333 --> 1:16:37.000
The thing is, uncle liked to recite poetry
when he was in the army.

1:16:37.208 --> 1:16:40.250
The soldier has retired
but the poet in him is still alive.

1:16:40.333 --> 1:16:41.542
That was poetry?

1:16:44.125 --> 1:16:48.333
Father, you should stop writing poetry,
I am sure mother will come back to you.

1:16:49.667 --> 1:16:51.833
When are you giving me the good news?

1:16:52.333 --> 1:16:54.333
Mother, I will be back
after meeting Karan.

1:16:54.417 --> 1:16:55.417
-Okay.
-Mother,

1:16:55.500 --> 1:16:59.083
Karan will give you the good news.
He spends more time with him than with me.

1:16:59.208 --> 1:17:04.083
Did you hear her taunt?
Son, your father was in the army.

1:17:04.417 --> 1:17:08.167
Yet he spared enough time to make it
possible for me to see his face.

1:17:08.250 --> 1:17:10.375
Mother, you have started talking
about children as soon as you came.

1:17:10.458 --> 1:17:13.042
Sit, relax. Enjoy your breakfast.
I will back in a jiffy.

1:17:13.792 --> 1:17:18.083
-He has not one but four offices, uncle.
-Why does he need four offices?

1:17:18.167 --> 1:17:20.083
Why doesn't he combine all four
and get them under one roof?

1:17:21.833 --> 1:17:23.958
-Have you studied science, uncle?
-No.

1:17:24.250 --> 1:17:26.833
Superb.
Then you will understand this even better.

1:17:27.542 --> 1:17:32.917
When sulfate, oxygen, nitrogen,
and hydrogen are filled into a cylinder,

1:17:33.042 --> 1:17:34.750
it doesn't just burn
a stove but the entire house.

1:17:34.875 --> 1:17:36.375
It causes a blast.

1:17:37.958 --> 1:17:40.458
-Are you married?
-No.

1:17:40.583 --> 1:17:42.333
Then you will understand this even better.

1:17:42.833 --> 1:17:46.000
A household runs with home-science
and not science.

1:17:46.250 --> 1:17:48.792
-Okay, uncle.
-Father, when did you arrive?

1:17:49.250 --> 1:17:50.417
I seek your blessings.

1:17:51.667 --> 1:17:54.625
Idiot! Where are you these days?

1:17:55.083 --> 1:17:57.250
Your wife told me
that you don't come home at night.

1:17:57.750 --> 1:18:00.458
-Are you a businessman or a watchman?
-What can I do? I've a lot of work to do.

1:18:00.583 --> 1:18:03.500
-I don't get the time.
-You need to balance both.

1:18:03.958 --> 1:18:07.167
-Because a house...
-Runs on home-science and not science.

1:18:07.458 --> 1:18:08.417
Hear that?

1:18:08.500 --> 1:18:11.167
He is not even married
and yet he understands.

1:18:11.250 --> 1:18:12.500
You too should understand.

1:18:12.792 --> 1:18:14.375
You should spend some time
with your wife as well.

1:18:14.542 --> 1:18:15.792
You should keep her happy.

1:18:15.958 --> 1:18:18.083
I keep her happy, now do you want me
to crack jokes to her?

1:18:18.583 --> 1:18:20.083
You keep me happy?

1:18:20.167 --> 1:18:22.125
-Tell me, what's special about tomorrow?
-Tomorrow?

1:18:22.458 --> 1:18:24.708
Forget whatever it is, tomorrow
we're gonna give father a tour of Mumbai.

1:18:24.792 --> 1:18:25.792
Day after tomorrow, he'll leave.

1:18:25.875 --> 1:18:27.667
Who said I am leaving?
I have just come here.

1:18:27.875 --> 1:18:29.375
I want to meet my old friends.

1:18:29.875 --> 1:18:31.500
I am not going anywhere
for another 20 days.

1:18:32.042 --> 1:18:34.250
Dear, you were saying something, right?

1:18:34.375 --> 1:18:37.208
-What's special about tomorrow?
-Father, tomorrow is my birthday.

1:18:37.458 --> 1:18:39.250
-Really?
-Did you remember?

1:18:41.125 --> 1:18:42.250
Yes, of course.

1:18:42.333 --> 1:18:44.625
A man can lose his memory
but can't forget his wife's birthday.

1:18:44.708 --> 1:18:46.458
Tomorrow I will celebrate your birthday
in such a way,

1:18:46.542 --> 1:18:48.417
you will feel
as if it's your first birthday.

1:18:55.875 --> 1:18:57.292
Bholu, have you made all the arrangements?

1:18:57.375 --> 1:18:58.917
-Yes, father. I am on it.
-Okay, listen,

1:18:59.208 --> 1:19:01.958
I am going to the market.
To buy a gift for daughter in-law.

1:19:02.250 --> 1:19:04.500
-Don't cut the cake until I come back.
-Okay.

1:19:05.625 --> 1:19:11.167
Sweetheart, I must say,
you don't look 35 years old.

1:19:11.458 --> 1:19:14.292
Hey! Shut up! I am only 26.

1:19:14.417 --> 1:19:16.542
Hear that? If I had asked for her age,
she would have said 21.

1:19:16.625 --> 1:19:18.625
Now she at least she told me
somewhere close to her real age.

1:19:21.208 --> 1:19:22.500
Karan, check who is at the door.

1:19:32.833 --> 1:19:33.833
Doomed!

1:19:38.833 --> 1:19:41.583
-Simran and Juhi.
-What?

1:19:41.875 --> 1:19:44.083
Your two wives have come
to meet the third one.

1:19:44.208 --> 1:19:46.667
-Why have they come to meet her?
-What do I know?

1:19:49.250 --> 1:19:51.250
Open the door.
Someone is ringing the bell.

1:19:51.333 --> 1:19:53.583
It's the kids, darling, they are just
ringing the bell and running away.

1:19:53.667 --> 1:19:55.292
-Yes.
-It must be my friends not the kids.

1:19:55.375 --> 1:19:57.333
I have invited them as well.
I'll go and answer the door.

1:19:57.417 --> 1:19:59.625
Friends? When did they become friends?

1:20:01.167 --> 1:20:02.167
I am so dead.

1:20:03.792 --> 1:20:05.042
Yes, actually...

1:20:10.125 --> 1:20:12.875
-What are you doing?
-There is no place to hide here.

1:20:15.583 --> 1:20:17.542
-Move aside, Karan.
-Why didn't you tell us beforehand?

1:20:17.625 --> 1:20:18.833
We would have brought a gift for you.

1:20:18.958 --> 1:20:20.500
Your husbands didn't accompany you?

1:20:20.583 --> 1:20:23.292
-My husband is on a night duty.
-Mine too.

1:20:23.458 --> 1:20:25.833
Luckily my husband is at home today.
He is on my duty today.

1:20:26.083 --> 1:20:28.250
-Step back.
-Come, let me introduce you to my husband.

1:20:28.333 --> 1:20:29.833
-Yeah, let's go.
-I am going to jump down.

1:20:29.917 --> 1:20:31.125
Have you lost your mind?
You will die.

1:20:46.208 --> 1:20:48.500
-What have you...
-Let me explain.

1:20:48.583 --> 1:20:51.042
To you, to you and to you too.

1:20:51.167 --> 1:20:52.917
And mine as well.
You have ruined everyone's cake.

1:20:53.292 --> 1:20:55.458
And your face
is completely unrecognizable.

1:20:56.333 --> 1:20:57.375
Really?

1:21:02.042 --> 1:21:03.750
What's wrong with your voice?

1:21:04.125 --> 1:21:06.750
I swallowed the candle along
with the cake.

1:21:06.958 --> 1:21:09.375
The candle is flickering inside.
I cannot speak properly.

1:21:09.708 --> 1:21:11.208
But why did you put your face in the cake?

1:21:11.500 --> 1:21:12.458
It's your birthday.

1:21:12.542 --> 1:21:13.958
Everyone would have smudged cake
on your face.

1:21:14.042 --> 1:21:16.208
I thought I should smudge it
on mine instead.

1:21:16.542 --> 1:21:19.167
You are just too much.
Go and quickly wash your face.

1:21:19.250 --> 1:21:20.500
Then I will introduce you to them.

1:21:20.583 --> 1:21:23.542
No. Today is your birthday.
This is your birthday cake.

1:21:23.667 --> 1:21:25.208
I will stay this way all day long.

1:21:25.292 --> 1:21:28.500
Let me meet your friends.
Hello, Simran. Hello, Juhi.

1:21:29.792 --> 1:21:32.167
Wait a minute.
How do you know their names?

1:21:35.833 --> 1:21:38.750
Sister-in-law you called them by their
names when you met them at the door.

1:21:39.917 --> 1:21:44.792
-The cake is on my face not in my ears.
-Karan, what are you doing over here?

1:21:44.958 --> 1:21:47.833
I? Sister-in-law, I am a lawyer.
I handle all the legal matters.

1:21:47.917 --> 1:21:50.127
Sister-in-law, she is my sister-in-law.
Sister-in-law, she is my sister-in-law.

1:21:50.202 --> 1:21:51.958
All married women in this building
are my sisters-in-law.

1:21:52.042 --> 1:21:53.375
I have 32 sisters-in-law and 30 brothers.

1:21:53.500 --> 1:21:55.727
-Why are there two brothers less?
-There are two extra sisters-in-law.

1:21:55.852 --> 1:21:58.208
Idiot! Have you come here to celebrate
my wife's birthday,

1:21:58.292 --> 1:22:00.333
or count your brothers
and sisters-in-law?

1:22:03.208 --> 1:22:05.833
Thank you, sweetheart.
Come, let's take a selfie.

1:22:06.042 --> 1:22:07.208
Super idea.

1:22:07.292 --> 1:22:09.667
I too will take a selfie with my hubby
on my birthday.

1:22:10.083 --> 1:22:11.583
Go ahead, take it. I won't stop you.

1:22:12.708 --> 1:22:14.667
-With you?
-Yes.

1:22:14.792 --> 1:22:18.042
All husbands look the same
when they have cake on their face.

1:22:21.583 --> 1:22:22.958
I think we all need a photo.

1:22:23.583 --> 1:22:24.500
Come.

1:22:24.583 --> 1:22:26.250
Come, my sisters-in-laws.

1:22:26.500 --> 1:22:27.500
Come, come.

1:22:27.583 --> 1:22:30.000
I'll show this photo to everyone
at the club's function tomorrow.

1:22:59.917 --> 1:23:00.917
You?

1:23:07.417 --> 1:23:09.375
I am seeing you after ages.

1:23:10.583 --> 1:23:12.625
-How are you?
-See for yourself.

1:23:13.167 --> 1:23:15.417
How incomplete
your soldier is without you.

1:23:15.958 --> 1:23:18.500
You brought a fair-skinned woman
from Kashmir, right?

1:23:18.667 --> 1:23:21.667
I fell in love with her
because I missed you, Rukmani.

1:23:22.208 --> 1:23:24.458
I could see your face in hers.

1:23:24.667 --> 1:23:26.958
I was a fool not to be able to see
your face in a doctor

1:23:27.042 --> 1:23:31.167
or an engineer's face.
And I kept waiting for you.

1:23:31.750 --> 1:23:35.583
You don't know,
the day that woman came before me.

1:23:36.583 --> 1:23:38.625
That night the temperature
had gone below zero.

1:23:38.875 --> 1:23:42.458
Even if the temperature is low,
one’s character should not be!

1:23:43.125 --> 1:23:44.917
Please forget about it Rukmani.

1:23:45.708 --> 1:23:46.792
Please forgive me.

1:23:48.042 --> 1:23:51.333
That girl from Kashmir
passed away after five years.

1:23:51.583 --> 1:23:52.750
That was bound to happen.

1:23:53.542 --> 1:23:56.958
Not everyone can bear
a soldier's attitude.

1:23:58.125 --> 1:23:59.458
You are just too much.

1:24:00.917 --> 1:24:04.292
You know that our Bholu got married?

1:24:04.625 --> 1:24:07.833
Yes, my Bholu's wife is so sweet.

1:24:07.917 --> 1:24:10.875
She is really well-cultured.
She takes good care of me.

1:24:10.958 --> 1:24:13.292
-She takes such good care of me.
-Of me--

1:24:15.292 --> 1:24:17.792
When did you meet her?
I am staying with her.

1:24:17.958 --> 1:24:19.625
Who are you staying with?

1:24:19.708 --> 1:24:21.667
-She is with me.
-What are you saying?

1:24:21.750 --> 1:24:23.583
-On which floor are you staying?
-On the fourth floor.

1:24:23.708 --> 1:24:26.500
And I am on the sixth.
This means... this means...

1:24:26.750 --> 1:24:31.250
Your son is just like you.
He too got married twice.

1:24:31.833 --> 1:24:35.167
-It's either him or me today.
-Wait, Rukmani.

1:24:35.417 --> 1:24:37.583
I have seen happiness
in my daughter-in-law's eyes.

1:24:38.333 --> 1:24:39.875
And loyalty in my son's eyes.

1:24:40.792 --> 1:24:43.625
-I too noticed that.
-We will talk to him.

1:24:43.917 --> 1:24:46.875
But until then,
we will let things be as they are.

1:24:47.292 --> 1:24:49.875
And we will meet here in the garden,
every morning, and evening.

1:24:50.833 --> 1:24:52.250
Will you come to meet me, Rukmani?

1:24:53.333 --> 1:24:56.208
I have been waiting for you
for the past 15 years,

1:24:56.542 --> 1:24:58.417
and you still ask me this question.

1:25:09.083 --> 1:25:11.042
-Father?
-Mother?

1:25:12.958 --> 1:25:15.125
What happened?
Why did you two stop?

1:25:15.292 --> 1:25:18.583
Hurry up. If we are late, we'll miss
the performance at the club.

1:25:27.333 --> 1:25:31.333
Everybody cheer up, I am high

1:25:31.625 --> 1:25:35.917
Move along with me,
It makes no difference to me

1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:40.292
My glass like youth is getting high.

1:25:49.667 --> 1:25:53.875
My glass like youth is getting high

1:25:54.250 --> 1:25:58.417
I can drink the entire river of love
It makes no difference to me

1:25:58.500 --> 1:25:59.958
It makes no difference

1:26:00.042 --> 1:26:05.500
I am drunk, whether it’s wrong or right

1:26:07.417 --> 1:26:11.875
Girl is high,
She is sloshed

1:26:11.958 --> 1:26:16.500
Girl is high,
She is sloshed

1:26:16.875 --> 1:26:22.792
When she dances,
All the lovers get excited

1:26:23.292 --> 1:26:25.875
Girl is high

1:26:41.375 --> 1:26:45.417
Let me stay drunk
Let me float in the river of love

1:26:45.958 --> 1:26:51.292
It is a wrong habit, let it stay wrong

1:26:52.708 --> 1:26:56.958
Girl is in the club
She has drunk the seven oceans

1:26:57.167 --> 1:27:02.000
She fears no one
A fire burns in her heart

1:27:02.292 --> 1:27:08.083
I am drunk, whether it’s wrong or right

1:27:08.542 --> 1:27:13.375
Girl is high,
She is sloshed

1:27:28.333 --> 1:27:32.917
I live in a different world
I have nothing to do with anyone

1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:38.125
I am Ranjha's Heer, God knows that

1:27:39.667 --> 1:27:44.083
Love's addiction is blind sighted
There are no restrictions

1:27:44.167 --> 1:27:49.042
If it aims, it can touch the sky

1:27:49.208 --> 1:27:54.833
It makes no difference
I am drunk, whatever I do is right

1:27:55.458 --> 1:28:00.000
Girl is high,
She is sloshed

1:28:00.583 --> 1:28:06.375
When I dance, all the lovers get excited

1:28:06.875 --> 1:28:13.583
Girl is high,
She is sloshed, girl is high

1:28:25.542 --> 1:28:28.083
Super performance Deepika.
We thoroughly enjoyed it.

1:28:34.458 --> 1:28:35.708
Thank you isn't enough.

1:28:35.792 --> 1:28:37.375
You will have to come
to my place for tea.

1:28:37.458 --> 1:28:38.917
-Sure.
-And have lunch at my place.

1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:40.167
And dinner at my place.

1:28:40.375 --> 1:28:42.125
Us three live in the same building.

1:28:42.583 --> 1:28:45.500
-In the same building? So cool.
-So tell us, when are you coming?

1:28:45.833 --> 1:28:50.417
Actually, soon I am going to get married.
I will come with my husband.

1:28:54.500 --> 1:28:55.458
Here you go.

1:28:57.417 --> 1:28:58.917
-Give it to her. Thank you.
-Okay.

1:28:59.083 --> 1:29:02.375
You know, I always have an ice-candy
from here whenever I pass by.

1:29:04.125 --> 1:29:05.875
But you shouldn't consume
so many calories.

1:29:05.958 --> 1:29:09.958
Husbands keep their arm around
your waist only while it's slim.

1:29:10.083 --> 1:29:13.583
I think love shouldn't be shallow.
Love should be forever.

1:29:20.958 --> 1:29:22.875
-My mother-in-law.
-My father-in-law.

1:29:23.750 --> 1:29:26.167
What?
They are your mother and father-in-law?

1:29:26.750 --> 1:29:29.375
I am so sorry.
I thought they were husband and wife.

1:29:29.458 --> 1:29:30.833
Mother-in-law has crossed the line
in Mumbai.

1:29:31.000 --> 1:29:32.167
And my father-in-law too.

1:29:33.042 --> 1:29:38.208
On your arrival I always glow like a lamp.
Without you, there is darkness everywhere.

1:29:38.583 --> 1:29:42.250
This is the age
to light a lamp in front of ones photo

1:29:42.667 --> 1:29:46.083
and you want to light up your love life.

1:29:47.417 --> 1:29:49.458
Stop your nonsense.
Have you lost your mind?

1:29:49.750 --> 1:29:52.625
I am telling the truth.
Your father is romancing in this age.

1:29:52.792 --> 1:29:54.125
Who will he romance with, in this age?

1:29:54.208 --> 1:29:56.292
You know my friend Juhi,
who lives on the fourth floor?

1:29:56.458 --> 1:29:59.042
He is having an affair
with her mother-in-law.

1:30:01.042 --> 1:30:04.208
-You mean mother and father have met?
-Mother and father?

1:30:04.375 --> 1:30:08.917
-Our father and their mother have met?
-Yes. We saw them together twice today.

1:30:09.083 --> 1:30:10.708
The first time,
they were hugging in the garden,

1:30:10.833 --> 1:30:13.833
and the second time at Bandstand,
drinking coconut water.

1:30:13.917 --> 1:30:14.958
Really?

1:30:15.875 --> 1:30:18.667
One heart says to the other

1:30:18.958 --> 1:30:22.458
I have fallen in love, again

1:30:23.167 --> 1:30:25.458
Father. Ask him where he was.

1:30:26.292 --> 1:30:27.333
Father?

1:30:30.542 --> 1:30:32.167
Where were you?

1:30:32.250 --> 1:30:35.167
Dear, I had gone to the army club
to kill some time.

1:30:35.583 --> 1:30:38.708
Oh, really?
But there is no army club over here.

1:30:38.917 --> 1:30:40.833
Yes, there isn't.
I searched hard, but I couldn't find it.

1:30:42.625 --> 1:30:44.375
And you, come in here.

1:30:44.917 --> 1:30:46.583
I want to discuss something
very important with you.

1:30:47.125 --> 1:30:48.625
Can I come after finishing
a small task, father?

1:30:49.042 --> 1:30:50.292
-Do come back.
-Sure.

1:30:53.167 --> 1:30:57.667
Listen, why was he staring at you
as if you are doing something wrong?

1:30:58.042 --> 1:30:59.875
This is the problem with senior citizens.
you know,

1:30:59.958 --> 1:31:03.583
they do wrong and pretend the other person
is to blame.

1:31:04.125 --> 1:31:06.500
Just make sure
that he doesn't call mother.

1:31:06.583 --> 1:31:07.625
Mother?

1:31:07.833 --> 1:31:09.833
Their mother.
The one he is having an affair with.

1:31:10.042 --> 1:31:12.250
-Not my mother.
-Yes.

1:31:13.333 --> 1:31:16.542
For the first time I've seen

1:31:16.875 --> 1:31:20.708
Love in my beloved's eyes

1:31:27.000 --> 1:31:28.000
Mother...

1:31:28.833 --> 1:31:31.792
you were not in the garden.
Where were you?

1:31:32.250 --> 1:31:35.750
I met a woman who lives here
in the garden.

1:31:35.875 --> 1:31:37.917
I went to attend
a spiritual discourse with her.

1:31:38.000 --> 1:31:39.083
Okay.

1:31:39.833 --> 1:31:42.042
You really enjoyed attending
the spiritual discourse, didn't you?

1:31:42.375 --> 1:31:46.583
Dear, of course at such an age
only spiritual discourses can be enjoyed.

1:31:47.708 --> 1:31:51.625
-Make me a cup of tea.
-Should I get you coconut water instead?

1:31:53.583 --> 1:31:56.375
-I already had coconut water.
-In the spiritual discourse?

1:31:56.708 --> 1:31:59.500
But the coconut water is in the coconut.

1:32:01.292 --> 1:32:05.458
I think you are tired.
Let me make tea for you instead.

1:32:14.667 --> 1:32:16.833
-Where is mother?
-Kishan, come here.

1:32:19.083 --> 1:32:21.125
You should send mother back
to the village.

1:32:21.208 --> 1:32:24.458
-Why? You cannot serve her anymore?
-No. You don't know.

1:32:24.542 --> 1:32:26.208
Mother is having an affair.

1:32:26.542 --> 1:32:28.167
-What nonsense!
-Honestly.

1:32:28.667 --> 1:32:31.958
She is romancing
with sixth floor's Anjali's father-in-law.

1:32:32.208 --> 1:32:33.333
Really?

1:32:33.750 --> 1:32:35.208
-You aren't surprised.
-I am surprised.

1:32:35.292 --> 1:32:37.708
A lot, from within. But what can we do?

1:32:38.042 --> 1:32:40.208
When a clingy person stays away
from someone for a long time,

1:32:40.292 --> 1:32:41.333
then this happens.

1:32:41.667 --> 1:32:43.292
-But this is wrong.
-Why?

1:32:43.375 --> 1:32:45.500
Don't you get upset when you
have to spend two nights without me?

1:32:45.708 --> 1:32:47.792
Mother got separated
from father 15 years ago.

1:32:48.208 --> 1:32:51.083
It is possible that mother sees
her husband in that man.

1:32:51.375 --> 1:32:52.458
Really?

1:32:52.583 --> 1:32:54.667
-In how many women do you see me?
-In three.

1:32:54.792 --> 1:32:56.333
Two of them are married
and one is still single.

1:32:56.500 --> 1:32:58.875
If you ask stupid questions
you will get stupid answers.

1:32:59.083 --> 1:33:01.208
Take care of mother, just make sure
she doesn't call father.

1:33:01.708 --> 1:33:02.750
Their father.

1:33:02.958 --> 1:33:05.375
-Do I have to explain everything?
-When did I ask that?

1:33:05.708 --> 1:33:06.833
But you were going to.

1:33:07.583 --> 1:33:11.667
You know, darling, I love you.
So I know what you are about to ask.

1:33:12.250 --> 1:33:15.917
I love you too.
I pray everyone gets a husband like you.

1:33:31.042 --> 1:33:32.333
What does he do?

1:33:32.625 --> 1:33:34.542
He works at a security agency, sir.

1:33:34.917 --> 1:33:37.042
Are you sure he is the one
you are going to get married to?

1:33:37.125 --> 1:33:38.167
Yes, sir.

1:33:40.917 --> 1:33:42.750
I just spoke to Anjali.

1:33:42.833 --> 1:33:44.917
She is coming with her husband.
Let's take her along.

1:33:45.250 --> 1:33:48.000
I keep dreaming about having a child.

1:33:48.208 --> 1:33:50.958
Whereas you don't even have time
to love your wife.

1:33:51.042 --> 1:33:52.458
There is a time to make love, sweetheart.

1:33:52.542 --> 1:33:54.708
Of course,
I won’t start loving you in public.

1:33:57.667 --> 1:33:58.833
Love you, sweetheart.

1:34:00.250 --> 1:34:03.500
-Anjali?
-Strange. You just said no to love.

1:34:03.833 --> 1:34:07.292
It's enjoyable to love after refusal.
Don't let go.

1:34:08.167 --> 1:34:11.167
-You are so sweet.
-Her husband is so romantic.

1:34:11.250 --> 1:34:13.750
-He is romancing in public place.
-So sweet.

1:34:14.125 --> 1:34:16.042
I pray everyone gets a husband like him.

1:34:16.500 --> 1:34:19.750
I am late again.
What excuse will I make today?

1:34:21.792 --> 1:34:22.875
Sir?

1:34:23.958 --> 1:34:25.167
Champa!

1:34:25.875 --> 1:34:27.250
-Madam!
-Who is she?

1:34:27.333 --> 1:34:29.250
My maid. she comes to ruin every moment.

1:34:29.500 --> 1:34:32.500
If madam is over there,
then who is sir with?

1:35:02.958 --> 1:35:05.750
-Let’s go, it doesn't look nice.
-Let’s go.

1:35:10.333 --> 1:35:12.292
Now I have loved you in front
of everyone because you insisted.

1:35:12.375 --> 1:35:13.875
What will people say
if they see us like this?

1:35:13.958 --> 1:35:16.542
Go. Your friends must be waiting for you.
Go on.

1:35:17.500 --> 1:35:18.625
How does he know?

1:35:19.500 --> 1:35:22.333
I sometimes don't understand
what he says or does.

1:35:22.583 --> 1:35:24.375
-Disgusting.
-What happened, Champa?

1:35:24.542 --> 1:35:27.042
Sir, I don't understand
what is going on in this society.

1:35:27.667 --> 1:35:29.833
Sir was hugging some other woman.

1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:32.208
And madam was watching it.
And she didn't even say anything.

1:35:32.458 --> 1:35:34.542
-It's nothing.
-It's nothing?

1:35:34.667 --> 1:35:36.250
You say it's nothing?

1:35:36.667 --> 1:35:40.708
Now if someone else gets the good news,
then don't come crying to me.

1:35:40.833 --> 1:35:43.125
Champa, Champa,
have you studied science?

1:35:43.333 --> 1:35:44.917
Does this too involve Newton?

1:35:45.125 --> 1:35:48.375
No, this is medical science.
What he was doing was

1:35:48.458 --> 1:35:50.917
is called mouth-to-mouth
artificial respiration system.

1:35:51.125 --> 1:35:52.250
-What?
-I mean,

1:35:52.375 --> 1:35:54.750
to breathe into someone else's mouth
through your mouth.

1:35:54.875 --> 1:35:58.333
Champa, it is possible that
the lady was having a problem breathing.

1:35:58.500 --> 1:36:00.375
So he was helping her.

1:36:00.500 --> 1:36:03.417
Sir, I know what I saw.
He was hugging her.

1:36:03.500 --> 1:36:05.333
Now he can't go breathe
into every woman's mouth, can he?

1:36:05.417 --> 1:36:07.083
Wouldn't he be considered characterless?

1:36:07.167 --> 1:36:08.500
-What are you saying?
-Yes.

1:36:08.583 --> 1:36:11.750
Instead of mouth-to-mouth
he must be giving chest-to-chest science.

1:36:13.125 --> 1:36:14.917
Now I understand. I understand.

1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:17.208
Don't tell that to sister-in-law.
She will think that you are stupid.

1:36:17.375 --> 1:36:21.667
Sir, I am not that stupid.
I understand mouth-to-mouth.

1:36:21.792 --> 1:36:24.625
But sir, I got confused
because it was chest-to-chest.

1:36:25.708 --> 1:36:28.708
-Sir, will you do me a favor?
-Yes, Champa?

1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:31.417
-Can you accompany me in the elevator.
-Why?

1:36:31.875 --> 1:36:34.625
Because sometimes I have problem
breathing in the elevator.

1:36:34.750 --> 1:36:36.375
-Please come with me, sir.
-Get lost.

1:36:39.458 --> 1:36:40.417
Yes, I do.

1:36:43.500 --> 1:36:46.417
-Yes, Deepu?
-Kumar, dad just called me up.

1:36:46.792 --> 1:36:48.708
He was saying strange things about you.

1:36:48.833 --> 1:36:51.042
-I fought with him.
-Really? What did he say?

1:36:51.417 --> 1:36:54.292
First come and meet me.
And also bring Karan along.

1:36:54.583 --> 1:36:56.167
I want to discuss something
very important.

1:36:57.333 --> 1:37:01.292
-What? Court marriage?
-Yes, there is no other option left.

1:37:01.958 --> 1:37:04.417
My dad keeps having strange suspicions
about you.

1:37:04.875 --> 1:37:07.625
Today, he accused you
of having someone else in your life.

1:37:08.542 --> 1:37:10.750
Really? Did he say that?

1:37:12.333 --> 1:37:15.667
But I swear, Deepika.
You are the only one I love.

1:37:17.417 --> 1:37:20.250
That's why I want us
to get married as soon as possible.

1:37:20.333 --> 1:37:22.750
She is right. Get married in the court.

1:37:22.917 --> 1:37:25.917
It won't create a scene.
And it is better for you as well.

1:37:26.208 --> 1:37:27.208
Try to understand.

1:37:27.625 --> 1:37:29.833
Of course, and I'll get saved
from getting into a mess.

1:37:30.542 --> 1:37:32.625
I mean we'll save ourselves
from all the wedding expenses.

1:37:33.042 --> 1:37:35.167
Okay then, done, you come to the court
with your witness.

1:37:35.250 --> 1:37:37.250
-Okay.
-You come to the court with your witness.

1:37:37.375 --> 1:37:38.583
I will get you two married.

1:37:48.625 --> 1:37:51.125
I'm going to meet a foreign delegation
that's why I am wearing a suit.

1:37:51.458 --> 1:37:53.000
I'm not going to get married.

1:37:53.750 --> 1:37:56.000
When did I say that
you are going to get married?

1:37:56.792 --> 1:38:00.208
No, I thought when one's going through
a bad phase,

1:38:00.375 --> 1:38:03.125
then people start doubting for no reason.
That's why I said all that.

1:38:05.667 --> 1:38:08.667
Your love doesn't lack anything.
Why should I be suspicious of you?

1:38:14.417 --> 1:38:15.750
-Where is she?
-Not the maid, baby.

1:38:15.833 --> 1:38:17.708
I am saying bye to you.
I am in a little hurry.

1:38:17.958 --> 1:38:20.208
You can make a note of this one.
I will settle the score tomorrow.

1:38:20.333 --> 1:38:23.833
Can I go now?
Thank you, baby. Bye.

1:38:25.542 --> 1:38:28.333
Father, I am going to do
something very important.

1:38:28.833 --> 1:38:30.208
I cannot do it without your blessing.

1:38:31.083 --> 1:38:32.542
Son, I met your mother.

1:38:33.417 --> 1:38:34.875
-Mother?
-Yes. Your mother.

1:38:35.333 --> 1:38:36.625
What's with two wives?

1:38:39.167 --> 1:38:41.000
-Well father, these two--
-What two?

1:38:41.958 --> 1:38:44.875
Yes, two Laddoos.
Offer two of them Lord Hanuman.

1:38:45.167 --> 1:38:46.458
And two at the Shani's temple.

1:38:46.542 --> 1:38:48.667
-I have pledged something.
-Okay, father.

1:38:48.792 --> 1:38:51.542
He must have pledged
for that old woman. What else could it be?

1:38:53.417 --> 1:38:56.000
Listen, brother has sent clothes
for the child.

1:38:56.125 --> 1:38:58.542
-Come, I will show them to you.
-I'll be right back, father.

1:39:04.125 --> 1:39:05.125
Kids?

1:39:05.917 --> 1:39:07.625
What else is he hiding?

1:39:07.833 --> 1:39:09.167
Where are they?

1:39:09.458 --> 1:39:11.458
BOMBAY HIGH COURT

1:39:16.458 --> 1:39:17.917
-Yes?
-Where are you?

1:39:18.042 --> 1:39:20.417
If the judge left, you won't be able
to get married. Hurry up.

1:39:24.417 --> 1:39:26.542
Okay, Anjali.
See you in the evening.

1:39:26.917 --> 1:39:29.083
Bye, father.
I am going. I am getting late.

1:39:32.875 --> 1:39:34.042
Bye, sweetheart.

1:39:34.917 --> 1:39:37.625
He already has two wives,
now he wants a third one?

1:39:39.250 --> 1:39:40.625
He is one step ahead of me.

1:39:41.042 --> 1:39:44.000
-I am going, mother.
-Stop. Sit.

1:39:44.875 --> 1:39:46.333
What's with this two-marriage thing?

1:39:48.042 --> 1:39:49.708
Look mother, the two--

1:39:50.333 --> 1:39:53.167
Yes, mother. I will offer two Laddoos.
Two to Lord Shani and two to Lord Hanuman.

1:39:53.250 --> 1:39:54.750
-Laddoos?
-Yes. That...

1:39:54.958 --> 1:40:00.250
-Yes. Laddoos. Yes, do offer them.
-Why are you offering Laddoos, mother?

1:40:00.542 --> 1:40:04.292
For the peace in this house
and for him to come to his senses.

1:40:04.708 --> 1:40:06.833
Everyone needs to come back
to their senses, mother?

1:40:07.292 --> 1:40:10.458
Yes, of course.
So then I will offer two for you as well.

1:40:11.667 --> 1:40:13.667
I know why she is offering Laddoos.

1:40:13.875 --> 1:40:15.792
I am sure she must have prayed
for that old man.

1:40:16.042 --> 1:40:17.167
Give me your blessings, mother.

1:40:17.250 --> 1:40:19.167
So far, only accidentally
good things have happened to me.

1:40:19.250 --> 1:40:21.875
Today, I'm going for something good,
just pray nothing bad happens.

1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:23.917
My blessings are always with you.

1:40:24.375 --> 1:40:27.125
Just remember one thing,
never break a woman's heart,

1:40:27.375 --> 1:40:29.542
and her family.

1:40:30.250 --> 1:40:33.375
Just to keep this promise I ended up
fulfilling 28 vows of marriage.

1:40:33.875 --> 1:40:35.708
There are seven vows in a marriage,
not 28.

1:40:36.042 --> 1:40:38.292
Yes, but for a person
who loves you four-fold,

1:40:38.375 --> 1:40:39.625
for him four times seven is 28.

1:40:39.792 --> 1:40:41.000
What? Four?

1:40:41.250 --> 1:40:43.375
You heard that, mother?
That's why I say,

1:40:43.917 --> 1:40:45.542
everyone should get a husband like him.

1:40:46.375 --> 1:40:48.417
God is slowly giving it to everyone.

1:40:48.500 --> 1:40:50.292
-See you, mother. Bye.
-Okay.

1:40:57.343 --> 1:40:58.583
Sorry, I got here a little late.

1:40:58.667 --> 1:41:00.208
You reached the accidental weddings
on time.

1:41:00.292 --> 1:41:02.042
-And here you are late.
-Forget it. Where is Deepika?

1:41:02.125 --> 1:41:03.958
She was here.
She has gone to get her witness.

1:41:04.542 --> 1:41:06.708
-We are so dead, brother. Look over there.
-What happened?

1:41:08.583 --> 1:41:10.375
Damn.
When did all four of them meet each other?

1:41:10.542 --> 1:41:11.667
How should I know?

1:41:11.958 --> 1:41:13.333
Do one thing, I am leaving,
you handle them.

1:41:13.417 --> 1:41:15.708
-Why do you always get me trapped?
-Tell her my witness had an accident.

1:41:15.792 --> 1:41:17.292
-Say something. Say anything.
-What will I say?

1:41:18.292 --> 1:41:20.417
No, you take care
of everything over there.

1:41:20.500 --> 1:41:22.792
I will explain everything to them.
They will understand.

1:41:22.875 --> 1:41:25.000
-I know. I trust them.
-What happened?

1:41:25.083 --> 1:41:26.208
I will call you back, brother.

1:41:26.500 --> 1:41:28.708
-Deepika, actually...
-Karan, what are you doing here?

1:41:29.042 --> 1:41:31.417
What are all three of you doing over here?

1:41:31.875 --> 1:41:34.417
-Do you know each other?
-He stays in our building.

1:41:34.500 --> 1:41:36.833
Yes, and he handles
our husbands' legal matters.

1:41:36.958 --> 1:41:39.500
Not just your husband, sister-in-law,
I also save her future husband.

1:41:39.708 --> 1:41:45.417
-I mean save his taxes. It is my job.
-But why hasn't Kumar reached here yet?

1:41:45.750 --> 1:41:47.500
Actually, he just called me.

1:41:47.583 --> 1:41:49.792
His witness had a small accident.

1:41:49.875 --> 1:41:53.125
-What?
-And Kumar is with him at the hospital.

1:41:53.458 --> 1:41:55.750
But I am feeling really bad.
I am really sorry.

1:41:55.833 --> 1:41:57.083
You have been troubled unnecessarily.

1:41:57.167 --> 1:41:59.958
No, it's an emergency.
we can't say anything about it.

1:42:00.208 --> 1:42:03.875
Yeah, actually, in fact,
I am happy that your boyfriend is so nice.

1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:07.083
He thought saving someone's life
is more important than getting married.

1:42:07.375 --> 1:42:09.792
I pray God bestows everyone
with a husband like him.

1:42:10.542 --> 1:42:12.792
Of course, God will.
He always does. I know.

1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:16.875
Let’s choose another date for
your wedding, say in two days?

1:42:17.042 --> 1:42:19.667
-Will that be fine?
-Yes. I think that's perfect.

1:42:19.917 --> 1:42:21.958
We too will come here on that date.

1:42:22.125 --> 1:42:23.083
-Right?
-Yes, absolutely.

1:42:26.750 --> 1:42:28.083
Come with me, sister-in-law. This way.

1:42:31.042 --> 1:42:34.625
-Come, let's go and check.
-I think you misheard him.

1:42:34.958 --> 1:42:36.250
He is already married twice.

1:42:36.333 --> 1:42:38.125
Why would he want to get married
the third time?

1:42:38.250 --> 1:42:40.542
After all he is our son,
and not some wild bull.

1:42:40.625 --> 1:42:42.167
I am telling the truth, Rukmani.

1:42:42.333 --> 1:42:44.417
He is here.
Let's go over there and enquire.

1:42:45.792 --> 1:42:46.792
Mother?

1:42:47.667 --> 1:42:49.833
-Father?
-What are they doing here?

1:42:51.875 --> 1:42:54.458
Excuse me? Where do couples get married?

1:42:55.375 --> 1:42:58.000
-They are getting married?
-They are in such a hurry!

1:42:58.167 --> 1:43:01.125
Just yesterday they fell in love
and today they are here to get married.

1:43:01.250 --> 1:43:03.208
Anjali, with the speed
at which they are going inside,

1:43:03.292 --> 1:43:06.208
I think your husband will have a sibling
before you two can have a child.

1:43:06.333 --> 1:43:08.292
Oh, my God.
I will go and inform Kishan.

1:43:08.375 --> 1:43:09.833
And I will inform Ram.

1:43:12.208 --> 1:43:13.417
Please check and let us know.

1:43:14.042 --> 1:43:16.667
Look sir, no one by the name
of Shivram Kishan

1:43:16.750 --> 1:43:18.125
is getting married today.

1:43:19.333 --> 1:43:20.500
Are you satisfied now?

1:43:20.958 --> 1:43:22.042
Let's go now.

1:43:22.708 --> 1:43:24.208
Everything will be okay.

1:43:24.292 --> 1:43:25.167
Hey!

1:43:25.708 --> 1:43:27.000
-You are here.
-Yes, I am here.

1:43:27.083 --> 1:43:29.000
You didn't go to the hospital
to save your friend's life?

1:43:29.083 --> 1:43:30.750
I did. He survived so I came here.

1:43:31.125 --> 1:43:33.458
You, friend, barely survived today.
So, shall we get married now?

1:43:33.583 --> 1:43:35.500
But my witnesses have already left.

1:43:36.125 --> 1:43:37.542
-Shall I call them back?
-No. Why?

1:43:37.625 --> 1:43:39.375
Court marriages don't last
for long anyways.

1:43:39.458 --> 1:43:41.083
Let's do one thing.
Let's get married in a temple.

1:43:41.458 --> 1:43:42.917
You go to the temple
with all the things.

1:43:43.000 --> 1:43:44.542
-Okay?
-How will I get the things?

1:43:44.708 --> 1:43:46.917
-Go.
-Am I a lawyer or what?

1:43:47.208 --> 1:43:50.208
Let's go. We will go to a temple
and get married over there.

1:43:56.250 --> 1:43:58.500
-Dad.
-What did you think?

1:43:58.625 --> 1:44:00.625
You'll go to the court
and I won't find out about it?

1:44:00.750 --> 1:44:01.833
Then what else could I do?

1:44:02.083 --> 1:44:06.333
-You left me no choice.
-So, this is your choice?

1:44:06.417 --> 1:44:08.625
He is a fraud.
How many times do I have to tell you that?

1:44:08.750 --> 1:44:12.667
-He is a scoundrel. He is engaged.
-No, he is not engaged.

1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:16.125
Really? You are not engaged to anyone?

1:44:16.625 --> 1:44:18.833
No, sir.
I've never been engaged.

1:44:19.333 --> 1:44:21.708
Okay. I will show you.

1:44:22.333 --> 1:44:23.375
Pooja!

1:44:26.667 --> 1:44:27.750
Yes, sir?

1:44:28.708 --> 1:44:33.458
Tell them.
Are you engaged to him or not?

1:44:33.750 --> 1:44:35.167
What will she say, sir?
Let me tell you.

1:44:35.458 --> 1:44:38.542
This is the first time I am meeting her.
And you say that I am engaged to her.

1:44:38.708 --> 1:44:40.833
I didn't say that.
She is the one who told me.

1:44:41.500 --> 1:44:42.667
Tell them.

1:44:43.375 --> 1:44:46.042
-Tell them. See?
-Yes, sir.

1:44:46.500 --> 1:44:49.292
-No sir, he is telling the truth.
-What?

1:44:49.583 --> 1:44:51.000
I am not engaged to him.

1:44:52.333 --> 1:44:54.833
-Hear her, dad?
-Hey, but...

1:44:55.708 --> 1:45:00.042
Then why do you have this photograph
pinned up on your desk?

1:45:00.458 --> 1:45:01.583
Wait a minute.

1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:06.708
I had left this photo
of Kumar on your table.

1:45:07.083 --> 1:45:08.167
-You?
-Yes.

1:45:08.250 --> 1:45:09.208
-But this...
-Yes, sir.

1:45:09.417 --> 1:45:13.750
I too had brought my fiancé’s photograph.
But I don't know how it got changed.

1:45:14.125 --> 1:45:17.875
I didn't want to lose my job, sir.
Hence, I didn't say anything.

1:45:19.333 --> 1:45:20.417
Sorry?

1:45:21.250 --> 1:45:25.292
Because of your mistake,
I was suspicious of my future son-in-law.

1:45:26.083 --> 1:45:27.708
I broke my daughter's heart.

1:45:28.917 --> 1:45:31.667
You are fired. Find a new job.
Get out.

1:45:33.500 --> 1:45:36.667
Spare her, sir. A person lies
when there is no way around.

1:45:37.125 --> 1:45:38.917
And no one knows that better than me.

1:45:39.667 --> 1:45:43.542
-Let it go sir.
-Yes, dad. Please forgive her.

1:45:46.042 --> 1:45:48.417
Fine, I will forgive her
because you have asked me to.

1:45:49.167 --> 1:45:50.125
Go.

1:45:51.958 --> 1:45:53.833
Thank you, sir.
Because of you I didn't lose my job.

1:45:54.042 --> 1:45:56.792
No problem.
I have a bad habit of rescuing girls.

1:45:56.875 --> 1:45:59.208
Even if by doing that I end up in trouble.
No problem. Please carry on.

1:46:08.125 --> 1:46:10.833
Now I shall never doubt you.

1:46:11.792 --> 1:46:15.417
And I will also get you two married.
In a grand manner!

1:46:16.708 --> 1:46:18.917
-Nice?
-Hareesh, friends, relatives,

1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:20.833
Everyone should get an invitation.

1:46:21.042 --> 1:46:22.750
-It should be a grand wedding.
-Sure.

1:46:22.833 --> 1:46:24.958
And distribute
all these invitation cards today.

1:46:25.042 --> 1:46:26.292
Daddy, these are my personal invites.

1:46:26.375 --> 1:46:29.167
-I will send them.
-Okay. Not a problem.

1:46:29.458 --> 1:46:31.042
Hey son, come in.

1:46:31.208 --> 1:46:33.500
Papa,
the preparations are in full swing.

1:46:33.583 --> 1:46:35.583
Sister-in-law, let me know
if you need me to do anything.

1:46:35.958 --> 1:46:37.083
Yes, there is something.

1:46:38.458 --> 1:46:39.667
Sweetheart!

1:46:40.292 --> 1:46:42.667
Karan, you live
in the Cocktail Tower, right?

1:46:42.750 --> 1:46:44.375
-Yes, sister-in-law.
-Three of my friends live there.

1:46:44.458 --> 1:46:47.000
I have already called them up.
You just need to give them these invites.

1:46:53.833 --> 1:46:56.542
Brother, your three wives
will be attending your wedding.

1:46:56.875 --> 1:46:58.375
Now how will you get married?

1:47:13.833 --> 1:47:17.083
The date is fixed.
The invites have been distributed.

1:47:17.958 --> 1:47:20.583
Marriage will also take place.
You just wait and watch.

1:47:23.125 --> 1:47:24.708
It's going to be your funeral.

1:47:25.042 --> 1:47:26.833
-Papa, I wanted to say something.
-Yes, son?

1:47:26.917 --> 1:47:28.542
-You are doing a lot for our wedding.
-Yes.

1:47:28.625 --> 1:47:30.208
I too have a small desire.

1:47:30.292 --> 1:47:34.167
Tell me, what is it?
I am ready to do anything you say.

1:47:34.250 --> 1:47:36.250
Because one gets married
just once in a lifetime.

1:47:36.333 --> 1:47:38.167
It's not like,
it happens three to four times in life.

1:47:38.875 --> 1:47:43.000
Yes, at my wedding, I wanted everyone,
to recall their wedding.

1:47:43.083 --> 1:47:44.583
Let me not be
the only groom present there.

1:47:44.667 --> 1:47:46.208
Let Deepika not be the only bride
present there.

1:47:46.375 --> 1:47:49.042
Every boy should be a groom
and every girl should be a bride.

1:47:49.458 --> 1:47:51.750
Son, I am getting you two married.

1:47:52.083 --> 1:47:53.458
I am not arranging,
a congregational wedding.

1:47:53.542 --> 1:47:55.208
No, we are the only ones
who will be getting married.

1:47:55.292 --> 1:47:57.458
But you know, every boy
should be dressed as a groom.

1:47:57.542 --> 1:47:58.792
Every girl should be dressed as a bride.

1:48:00.792 --> 1:48:02.375
Each couple would look like
a newly-wed couple.

1:48:05.417 --> 1:48:06.417
Isn't it, dad?

1:48:11.625 --> 1:48:13.500
Get my wedding dress.

1:48:25.292 --> 1:48:28.958
Priest, your slow motion is
is causing me loose-motion.

1:48:29.167 --> 1:48:31.625
-Please hurry up a little. Please go.
-Sure.

1:48:32.125 --> 1:48:33.542
My brother! My brother! My brother!

1:48:33.625 --> 1:48:37.042
You have come up with an amazing theme!
No one knows anything.

1:48:37.125 --> 1:48:39.625
Since morning two sisters-in-law have
kissed me, thinking I'm their husband.

1:48:39.708 --> 1:48:42.208
No one can recognize
who is the real groom.

1:48:42.333 --> 1:48:44.333
Where is Kumar?

1:48:44.583 --> 1:48:47.333
He has made so many idiots
dressed as grooms.

1:48:48.167 --> 1:48:50.583
Kumar!
Sorry, sorry. Namaste.

1:48:53.375 --> 1:48:55.000
Uncle, your groom is over there.

1:48:56.125 --> 1:48:59.333
It's such a strange theme.
No one is able to recognize anyone.

1:48:59.417 --> 1:49:00.625
Papa, I am over here.

1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:03.125
See, no one is able to recognize anyone.

1:49:03.792 --> 1:49:05.958
Thank God, the brides aren't hiding
their faces under the veil.

1:49:06.042 --> 1:49:08.125
Otherwise I would've been slapped
40 times since morning.

1:49:08.208 --> 1:49:11.042
Papa, before a few more brides join us
why don't you call for my bride, please?

1:49:11.167 --> 1:49:13.792
Son, that's why I am here.
Deepu has been--

1:49:14.667 --> 1:49:15.917
Look there she is.

1:49:19.208 --> 1:49:20.917
Look dear, here he is.

1:49:27.917 --> 1:49:32.542
Kumar, it would've been so nice
if your parents could've joined us.

1:49:32.625 --> 1:49:33.750
They wanted to come,

1:49:33.833 --> 1:49:35.208
-but joint pain didn't let them.
-Hernia.

1:49:35.708 --> 1:49:36.792
Hernia?

1:49:37.042 --> 1:49:40.833
Actually the joint pain is so bad
that it is causing hernia.

1:49:40.917 --> 1:49:43.708
-And that is why they cannot walk around.
-Yes.

1:49:47.583 --> 1:49:49.917
But it's not like we wanted them
to parade around.

1:49:50.125 --> 1:49:53.083
They would've sat on the couch,
and given their blessings

1:49:53.500 --> 1:49:57.625
But, Papa, they can't even sit.
Actually, their piles are aggravated.

1:49:58.333 --> 1:49:59.750
Piles are aggravated?

1:50:00.375 --> 1:50:03.250
But I had heard
that villagers are very healthy.

1:50:03.625 --> 1:50:05.167
You have heard it right.

1:50:07.042 --> 1:50:11.167
-We eat pure butter and we have a lot fun.
-Brijmohan!

1:50:11.333 --> 1:50:13.875
-How do my parents know him?
-I don't know.

1:50:14.042 --> 1:50:17.000
-Congratulations.
-I knew you would come.

1:50:18.500 --> 1:50:20.417
-Hello, sister-in-law.
-Hello, brother.

1:50:20.625 --> 1:50:22.125
I am so happy to see you here.

1:50:22.208 --> 1:50:25.708
As you are here Deepu will also get
a mother's blessings. Come with me.

1:50:26.333 --> 1:50:28.708
-Dear, touch their feet.
-Namaste.

1:50:28.792 --> 1:50:29.917
God bless you, dear.

1:50:30.458 --> 1:50:32.667
He is my childhood friend, Brijmohan.

1:50:33.833 --> 1:50:36.542
And he is my future son-in-law.
Touch their feet, son.

1:50:38.333 --> 1:50:39.542
God bless you, son.

1:50:40.125 --> 1:50:42.833
-He is well-cultured.
-He is indeed well-cultured.

1:50:43.458 --> 1:50:45.667
Your son also lives in this city,
doesn't he?

1:50:45.833 --> 1:50:47.250
Why didn't he come with you?

1:50:47.375 --> 1:50:49.542
He is handling four offices.
He doesn't have time to spare.

1:50:49.750 --> 1:50:51.458
What a co-incidence!

1:50:51.542 --> 1:50:53.875
-My son-in-law too handles four offices.
-Really?

1:50:54.542 --> 1:50:56.375
Then son, always remember this.

1:50:56.667 --> 1:50:59.208
You need to balance your work
and your home life.

1:50:59.583 --> 1:51:01.333
Because a household doesn't run
with science--

1:51:01.625 --> 1:51:03.750
-It runs with home science.
-Correct.

1:51:04.750 --> 1:51:06.000
Who said that?

1:51:07.375 --> 1:51:10.958
Today you won't come to know.
Today, everyone looks the same.

1:51:11.125 --> 1:51:13.542
Come, let's go and meet our friends.
I mean let's go and find them.

1:51:13.667 --> 1:51:15.458
Let's go, sister-in-law.

1:51:19.292 --> 1:51:20.958
Look, my friends are here.

1:51:23.542 --> 1:51:25.875
-Come, let me introduce you to them.
-Go ahead. I will be right back.

1:51:25.958 --> 1:51:27.833
-Where are you going?
-I'll go and meet the priest.

1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:29.583
Forget all that, come with me.

1:51:29.667 --> 1:51:31.958
-You go ahead.
-Come with me.

1:51:38.208 --> 1:51:39.708
Bro, you leave, I'll handle them--

1:51:40.750 --> 1:51:41.958
You are looking so beautiful.

1:51:44.167 --> 1:51:45.792
Hey, won't you introduce us
to your husband?

1:51:45.875 --> 1:51:46.958
-Yes.
-Yes.

1:51:47.208 --> 1:51:51.042
-Please show us your face.
-Why are you blushing?

1:51:51.250 --> 1:51:53.750
Let me show it to you. He is my Kumar.

1:51:56.375 --> 1:51:58.083
No. There is some confusion.

1:51:58.208 --> 1:52:00.500
Actually, you mistook me for Kumar
and dragged me here.

1:52:00.875 --> 1:52:03.917
I didn't stop you as well.
The excitement shouldn't end, right?

1:52:04.458 --> 1:52:06.833
-Where is Kumar?
-I will go and find him.

1:52:07.458 --> 1:52:10.583
Priest, why is it taking so long?
Quickly start the wedding.

1:52:10.667 --> 1:52:12.333
First let me get all the things placed.

1:52:12.417 --> 1:52:13.958
It's not like you are preparing
for a barbecue.

1:52:14.042 --> 1:52:15.917
You just need to add four sticks.
Quickly start the wedding.

1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:17.958
Look, I will be starting the wedding
at the said auspicious time.

1:52:18.042 --> 1:52:20.625
If you are in a hurry
you can elope and get married.

1:52:23.292 --> 1:52:26.708
The marriage will only take place
after I let go of the groom.

1:52:27.375 --> 1:52:29.667
You wanted 20,000,000 rupees
as dowry, right?

1:52:30.292 --> 1:52:33.208
Now, if you want the groom back,
give me 50,000,000 rupees instead.

1:52:33.792 --> 1:52:37.583
And listen, if you want to say something,
text me.

1:52:37.833 --> 1:52:40.000
Because I don't listen to anyone.

1:52:45.417 --> 1:52:46.458
Hey, the groom ran away.

1:52:46.542 --> 1:52:47.583
-Let's catch him.
-Yes, let's go.

1:52:50.042 --> 1:52:51.708
We will get the ransom money
by day after tomorrow.

1:52:52.125 --> 1:52:54.333
Until then, you two
take care of this groom.

1:52:54.417 --> 1:52:56.750
-Tiger, the groom ran away.
-The groom ran away.

1:52:57.042 --> 1:52:58.208
-Tiger.
-Tiger.

1:52:58.292 --> 1:53:00.583
-Tiger. The groom ran away.
-Tiger. He ran away.

1:53:01.750 --> 1:53:03.917
-Tiger, the groom ran away.
-He ran away.

1:53:04.042 --> 1:53:06.500
-Police have come?
-Not the police. The groom ran away.

1:53:06.625 --> 1:53:08.833
-He ran away.
-He ran to the adjoined wedding hall.

1:53:08.917 --> 1:53:10.125
-The groom ran away.
-Yes.

1:53:23.250 --> 1:53:27.667
Hello. Look, this is a theme wedding.
Please wear a groom's attire.

1:53:27.917 --> 1:53:30.500
Don't worry,
we won't leave without eating.

1:53:30.625 --> 1:53:31.958
We are from the groom's side.

1:53:32.042 --> 1:53:34.458
You didn't get me.
You should change your dress.

1:53:36.083 --> 1:53:37.000
You don't understand, papa.

1:53:37.083 --> 1:53:39.542
If it gets even a little late as it is,
then it will be too late.

1:53:39.625 --> 1:53:40.500
Don't worry at all.

1:53:40.583 --> 1:53:42.167
I was talking about something
spicy and tangy, right?

1:53:42.250 --> 1:53:43.583
-Yes.
-Sister-in-law, you should try this.

1:53:43.667 --> 1:53:44.542
It is very tasty.

1:53:44.625 --> 1:53:46.917
Quickly eat them and go home.
This wedding will take a while.

1:53:47.000 --> 1:53:49.227
We are not in a hurry.
We have a lot of time to spare.

1:53:49.327 --> 1:53:51.208
Yes. We will enjoy the entire wedding.

1:53:51.500 --> 1:53:54.208
Don't worry.
I have permission till midnight.

1:53:54.292 --> 1:53:56.917
-Mr. Gulab Chand.
-Mr. Verma.

1:53:57.125 --> 1:53:58.917
This man will kill me.

1:54:04.958 --> 1:54:06.542
Sister-in-law!
Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law!

1:54:06.625 --> 1:54:09.167
You should try these Tiki first!
They are mind-blowing.

1:54:09.250 --> 1:54:10.875
-I swear they are delicious.
-Forget about Tiki.

1:54:10.958 --> 1:54:13.125
-I just saw Kishan over there.
-What are you saying, sister-in-law?

1:54:13.208 --> 1:54:15.167
-Yes, and I saw Shiv.
-And I saw Ram.

1:54:15.250 --> 1:54:16.917
It's just a misunderstanding,
sister-in-law.

1:54:17.000 --> 1:54:19.625
You are dressed as James Bond.
but you cannot handle four glasses.

1:54:19.750 --> 1:54:21.667
This is enough.
I'm already so worried,

1:54:21.833 --> 1:54:22.917
and he's dropping glasses over me.

1:54:23.292 --> 1:54:24.750
Okay then, tell me. Where is he?

1:54:26.375 --> 1:54:27.458
He isn't there, right?

1:54:27.583 --> 1:54:28.458
-No.
-So?

1:54:28.542 --> 1:54:31.333
It happens because of hallucination.
I am sure you three have studied science.

1:54:31.625 --> 1:54:33.042
-No.
-Superb.

1:54:33.125 --> 1:54:35.958
Then you will understand this even better.
This is what happens during hallucination.

1:54:36.250 --> 1:54:38.625
When we love someone
from the bottom of our heart,

1:54:38.708 --> 1:54:42.458
his image is so well engraved
into our minds that we see him everywhere.

1:54:42.542 --> 1:54:43.875
This is what happens in hallucination.

1:54:45.833 --> 1:54:50.125
Okay, tell me, can you see your husband
in the man standing with Deepika?

1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:53.125
-Yes!
-Yes!

1:54:53.958 --> 1:54:55.167
Come on, sister-in-law.

1:54:55.250 --> 1:54:58.042
How can you see Shiv, Ram
and Kishan in the same person?

1:55:01.917 --> 1:55:04.583
Look, now look at him again.
Do you see him in that man now?

1:55:07.708 --> 1:55:08.792
No.

1:55:08.917 --> 1:55:10.667
-No.
-So that's hallucination.

1:55:10.750 --> 1:55:12.083
Science is a very complicated thing.

1:55:12.250 --> 1:55:14.458
Forget about it. Enjoy the wedding.
Now come on, enjoy these.

1:55:14.542 --> 1:55:16.542
I'll go and arrange for some snacks.
Tell me what will you have?

1:55:16.625 --> 1:55:18.333
The one with fritters? I'll get both.

1:55:26.208 --> 1:55:27.250
Yes?

1:55:27.417 --> 1:55:29.875
Everyone here is dressed as a groom.
How will we find our groom?

1:55:31.292 --> 1:55:34.875
Don't use your brains.
Think of a way to find our groom.

1:55:38.083 --> 1:55:40.708
Idea. We'll apply vermillion
on everyone's forehead.

1:55:40.792 --> 1:55:42.792
-and take a look at their faces.
-Yes.

1:55:43.125 --> 1:55:44.250
Where is he?

1:55:46.583 --> 1:55:50.500
Priest, I am getting married.
So why are you feeding yourself?

1:55:53.083 --> 1:55:55.667
-Watch out stupid.
-You are eating Laddoo here.

1:55:56.083 --> 1:55:58.250
Deepu has been looking for you.

1:55:58.333 --> 1:55:59.333
-Okay.
-Go on now.

1:55:59.542 --> 1:56:01.667
And why are you eating Laddoo?
Have you come here to eat Laddoo

1:56:01.792 --> 1:56:03.875
or to get them married?
You are strange.

1:56:03.958 --> 1:56:06.125
All three of your wives are looking
for you.

1:56:06.292 --> 1:56:08.083
Quickly get married and leave.

1:56:08.625 --> 1:56:11.333
-Did you hear what I said?
-You...

1:56:12.542 --> 1:56:14.042
Who was that idiot?

1:56:19.750 --> 1:56:21.583
You have already done it four times.

1:56:26.750 --> 1:56:28.208
Brother-in-law,
what are you doing over here!

1:56:28.292 --> 1:56:31.708
-Are you here to attend the wedding?
-Yes. What brings you here?

1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:34.833
I am here for business reasons.
I was holding a groom on ransom.

1:56:35.083 --> 1:56:36.667
But he ran away and came
to this wedding venue.

1:56:36.875 --> 1:56:38.708
I wonder which idiot came up
with this theme.

1:56:38.958 --> 1:56:40.042
Everyone is dressed as a groom.

1:56:40.375 --> 1:56:42.167
If I find the person who came up
with this theme,

1:56:42.417 --> 1:56:44.083
he will be the first person to get shot.

1:56:44.167 --> 1:56:45.667
No brother,
a wedding is going to take place here.

1:56:45.750 --> 1:56:47.208
You should stay calm.
Enjoy yourself a little.

1:56:47.500 --> 1:56:49.000
Brother-in-law, you may go.
I will find him.

1:56:49.083 --> 1:56:51.000
-Okay, brother.
-Go. Let's go.

1:56:56.875 --> 1:57:00.542
Go and stand at the gate,
so that the groom doesn't get to escape.

1:57:00.917 --> 1:57:04.000
Only one wedding is taking place,
but there are many grooms present here.

1:57:04.458 --> 1:57:07.750
I think it's time for some fireworks.
Understood?

1:57:11.417 --> 1:57:13.833
Everyone come forward
for the garlanding ritual.

1:57:16.250 --> 1:57:17.375
Hey!

1:57:19.542 --> 1:57:20.625
Here as well?

1:57:21.042 --> 1:57:22.958
I think they couldn't get married
in the court.

1:57:23.042 --> 1:57:25.458
Have they come here thinking that
a congregational wedding's taking place&gt;

1:57:25.792 --> 1:57:28.625
Bride and groom,
exchange your garlands, please.

1:57:29.333 --> 1:57:31.750
May God Indra of great fame bless us--

1:57:38.083 --> 1:57:39.000
Brother?

1:57:41.458 --> 1:57:42.833
No one will move.

1:57:43.458 --> 1:57:44.667
I am looking for my groom.

1:57:46.667 --> 1:57:48.208
Everyone, take off your turbans.

1:57:50.875 --> 1:57:53.000
Take off or I will shoot you.

1:58:02.208 --> 1:58:03.542
You guys take off your turbans as well.

1:58:13.292 --> 1:58:16.167
Are you deaf? Take off your turban.

1:58:18.042 --> 1:58:19.083
Take it off.

1:58:22.792 --> 1:58:24.208
Remove it off or I will shoot you.

1:58:27.792 --> 1:58:29.500
-Take it off, son.
-Take it off , Kumar.

1:58:29.667 --> 1:58:31.458
-He'll shoot you. Take it off.
-Take it off.

1:58:31.917 --> 1:58:33.375
Take off your turban son.

1:58:37.917 --> 1:58:39.542
Take it off or I will shoot you.

1:58:40.042 --> 1:58:41.042
Take it off.

1:58:41.375 --> 1:58:42.792
-Bro, we found the groom.
-Take it off.

1:58:43.417 --> 1:58:44.458
Take it off.

1:58:45.542 --> 1:58:47.250
Boss, we found our groom.

1:58:48.167 --> 1:58:49.583
Where have you been?

1:58:51.458 --> 1:58:54.583
I am very sorry for troubling all of you.

1:58:55.125 --> 1:58:57.667
All of you, wear your turbans,
and enjoy the wedding.

1:58:58.833 --> 1:59:00.542
Priest, you may begin.

1:59:01.042 --> 1:59:02.542
-Let's take him away.
-Let's go.

1:59:03.917 --> 1:59:05.250
-You barely escaped, brother.
-Yes.

1:59:14.125 --> 1:59:16.833
Priest, why are you wasting our time.
Why don't you put all of it in one go?

1:59:30.417 --> 1:59:31.542
Bholu!

1:59:35.500 --> 1:59:38.000
-You?
-You are getting married again?

1:59:38.458 --> 1:59:39.542
In spite of having me?

1:59:40.250 --> 1:59:45.542
-What are you saying? Not you, he has me.
-How does it affect you? He is my husband.

1:59:46.417 --> 1:59:49.708
-He isn't your husband. He is my husband.
-Have you two lost your mind?

1:59:51.375 --> 1:59:54.708
Hey! Enough of this nonsense.
You've started joking again?

1:59:54.792 --> 1:59:58.208
Dear, they are the same three women
who fooled me at the mall.

1:59:58.292 --> 1:59:59.875
They said that he is their husband.

2:00:00.292 --> 2:00:05.500
-Hello. He is my husband, Shiv.
-He isn't Shiv. His is Ram, my husband.

2:00:05.667 --> 2:00:08.333
No Deepika, I am telling the truth.
He is my husband, Kishan.

2:00:10.125 --> 2:00:12.000
Have you three lost your mind?

2:00:12.750 --> 2:00:15.667
He isn't anyone's Shiv, Ram or Kishan.
He is my Kumar.

2:00:16.375 --> 2:00:17.417
Hold on.

2:00:32.625 --> 2:00:37.458
Say just yes or no to my question.

2:00:39.000 --> 2:00:42.583
Are the three of them your wives?

2:00:45.542 --> 2:00:47.417
-Mother--
-Yes or no.

2:00:50.958 --> 2:00:51.875
Yes.

2:00:55.250 --> 2:00:56.333
Shameless!

2:00:58.708 --> 2:01:00.375
You are married thrice already.

2:01:00.458 --> 2:01:02.250
And you were about to get married
for the fourth time!

2:01:02.708 --> 2:01:04.958
Why didn't you just die before doing
such a shameful deed?

2:01:05.333 --> 2:01:08.250
I wouldn't be as sad about your death
as I am now.

2:01:10.417 --> 2:01:13.333
You ruined the lives of four girls.

2:01:15.542 --> 2:01:18.125
Is this what I taught you?
Is this what I taught?

2:01:20.458 --> 2:01:22.458
You remember what I've always told you?

2:01:23.625 --> 2:01:27.833
Never break a woman's heart.
And never ruin a family!

2:01:29.000 --> 2:01:31.792
You broke everyone's trust.

2:01:32.917 --> 2:01:36.958
You ruined everyone's life.
Everyone's. Everyone's!

2:01:37.375 --> 2:01:40.167
Rukmani, that's enough. Stop it.

2:01:41.083 --> 2:01:46.208
I always said that my Bholu is very naive.

2:01:46.917 --> 2:01:48.083
But I was wrong.

2:01:48.917 --> 2:01:52.208
You are a cheat. A beguiler.

2:01:54.083 --> 2:01:55.042
No, mother.

2:01:56.708 --> 2:01:58.333
Your Bholu is not a cheat.

2:01:59.750 --> 2:02:01.250
I have not cheated anyone.

2:02:02.958 --> 2:02:04.000
Juhi, tell me...

2:02:05.208 --> 2:02:08.875
your father placed your hand in my hand
at the hospital and passed away.

2:02:09.792 --> 2:02:13.083
Did he ever ask
whether I already had anyone in my life?

2:02:17.583 --> 2:02:18.750
And Anjali, you?

2:02:19.417 --> 2:02:23.042
You were going to commit suicide, right?
I saved your life.

2:02:23.833 --> 2:02:26.958
Your brother forced me at gunpoint
to get married to you.

2:02:28.208 --> 2:02:29.542
Who was the one who cheated?

2:02:33.875 --> 2:02:35.042
And Simran, you?

2:02:36.292 --> 2:02:41.250
I had told you that my friend fooled me
into getting married to you.

2:02:43.250 --> 2:02:44.750
But you didn't listen to me.

2:02:44.958 --> 2:02:47.667
You wanted to jump into the holy fire
and kill yourself.

2:02:48.667 --> 2:02:50.042
Should I have left you to die?

2:02:51.042 --> 2:02:55.750
If I held your hand, just to save
your life. How is that cheating?

2:02:59.250 --> 2:03:05.667
Yes, I did make one mistake, mother.
I didn't tell them about each other.

2:03:06.583 --> 2:03:09.542
Because if I had told them,
then they would have killed themselves.

2:03:10.292 --> 2:03:11.500
Now, you tell me mother,

2:03:11.917 --> 2:03:15.708
how could I kill them
after saving their lives?

2:03:18.958 --> 2:03:23.083
If there is anyone whom I have
cheated on, that is you, Deepika.

2:03:24.583 --> 2:03:27.208
I didn't tell you
that I got married thrice.

2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:29.417
Now you tell me,
what should have I done?

2:03:30.708 --> 2:03:32.292
People try to forget tragedies.

2:03:33.208 --> 2:03:35.833
But I have been living with them.

2:03:36.833 --> 2:03:38.292
I didn't want three families.

2:03:39.167 --> 2:03:41.208
But I thought
if I have been through tragedy,

2:03:41.458 --> 2:03:44.542
then they have also gone through one.
It's not their fault either.

2:03:45.167 --> 2:03:50.458
I just wanted one family.
There was just one person that I love.

2:03:51.583 --> 2:03:54.500
You, Deepu.
And I didn't want to lose you.

2:04:00.125 --> 2:04:03.292
"Never break a woman's heart.
Never ruin a family."

2:04:04.417 --> 2:04:07.292
To keep my promise to you, your Bholu,

2:04:07.375 --> 2:04:09.583
Shivram Kishan got divided
into three parts, mother.

2:04:10.750 --> 2:04:14.000
I've been running faster than a clock,
so that I can give time to everyone.

2:04:14.583 --> 2:04:15.917
I have kept everyone happy.

2:04:17.000 --> 2:04:19.458
I showed everyone my face
before I left in the morning,

2:04:19.583 --> 2:04:21.542
so that there is a smile
on their faces all day long.

2:04:24.042 --> 2:04:27.375
I tried to keep everyone happy.
Ask them, mother. Ask them.

2:04:27.667 --> 2:04:30.375
Have I not been honest in the little time
that I've spent with each of them?

2:04:30.875 --> 2:04:32.917
Have I cheated even a little?

2:04:33.750 --> 2:04:34.792
Ask them, mother.

2:04:36.250 --> 2:04:40.125
If I would've rejected them
and settled down.

2:04:40.792 --> 2:04:44.000
Then neither you nor God
would have been happy.

2:04:44.875 --> 2:04:46.958
If you still feel that I am wrong,

2:04:47.667 --> 2:04:49.875
then you can punish
me whichever way you want.

2:04:51.458 --> 2:04:52.792
You have given me life.

2:04:54.208 --> 2:05:00.458
Even if you to take that life away,
I won't say a word.

2:05:01.292 --> 2:05:02.917
Your Bholu won't say a word.

2:05:12.917 --> 2:05:14.000
Son!

2:05:28.125 --> 2:05:29.958
What have you decided, Deepu?

2:05:33.292 --> 2:05:35.750
A person who can love
through tragedies...

2:05:37.583 --> 2:05:41.125
his love should not suffer
from any tragedy.

2:06:20.125 --> 2:06:21.208
This is good, brother.

2:06:21.292 --> 2:06:24.625
Even though they live on separate floors,
they have accepted each other.

2:06:24.708 --> 2:06:25.958
That's true.

2:06:26.083 --> 2:06:28.625
Karan, there is something
that I don't understand.

2:06:29.417 --> 2:06:31.208
What happened to me,
was it a comedy or a tragedy?

2:06:31.417 --> 2:06:33.542
Consider it to be comedy.
You will be able to live with it better.

2:06:33.667 --> 2:06:35.292
Anyway, you don't need
to fear anything now.

2:06:35.417 --> 2:06:38.917
-Everyone knows about your four marriages.
-You are right.

2:06:39.125 --> 2:06:42.167
But if Tiger found out about it,
he will shoot me.

2:06:42.292 --> 2:06:43.833
He won't be able
to understand the comedy.

2:06:45.250 --> 2:06:46.542
Tiger.

2:06:46.625 --> 2:06:49.000
It’s written on his forehead
that he doesn't listen to anyone.

2:06:49.083 --> 2:06:51.042
-Even his medical reports say that.
-Yes.

2:06:53.083 --> 2:06:54.500
How are you, Tiger?

2:06:55.167 --> 2:06:56.625
-He is Mr. Daruwala.
-Hi.

2:06:56.708 --> 2:06:59.208
He will look at your hand
and tell us when you'll have a kid.

2:06:59.458 --> 2:07:01.500
Strange.
Science tells it through sonograms.

2:07:01.583 --> 2:07:03.125
You will tell that just
by looking at his hands?

2:07:03.208 --> 2:07:04.083
Yes, I am an astrologer.

2:07:04.167 --> 2:07:07.583
First of all, I'll tell you
how a husband wife's relation should be.

2:07:07.792 --> 2:07:10.208
If that is good, only then
they will have kids.

2:07:10.833 --> 2:07:12.083
Come on, show me your hand.

2:07:14.458 --> 2:07:15.833
-Oh, my God.
-What happened?

2:07:15.917 --> 2:07:17.625
Is this the first time
you’re looking at a bare hand?

2:07:17.708 --> 2:07:20.042
No, you are destined for four marriages.

2:07:20.375 --> 2:07:22.750
Four kids! That's great news.

2:07:23.458 --> 2:07:24.625
Four marriages.

2:07:24.875 --> 2:07:27.750
-It will take four years? That is fine.
-Yes.

2:07:27.833 --> 2:07:30.417
-I have no problem with it.
-Four marriages! Four!

2:07:30.542 --> 2:07:32.375
You want 400 rupees? You will get it.

2:07:32.458 --> 2:07:34.000
-Take him back.
-Okay, let’s go.

2:07:34.083 --> 2:07:35.708
-Go.
-He is destined for four marriages.

2:07:35.792 --> 2:07:38.458
-He is not listening.
-Look, he said, you will have four kids.

2:07:38.833 --> 2:07:40.958
But I would still say
that two kids are enough.

2:07:41.125 --> 2:07:42.375
He has four wives.

2:07:42.458 --> 2:07:45.542
If each wife has two kids,
he will have eight kids for sure.

2:07:46.000 --> 2:07:48.792
Not eight, it should take nine months
to deliver a child.

2:07:49.083 --> 2:07:51.750
Otherwise the child will be weak.
Have you not studied science?

2:07:51.917 --> 2:07:53.583
I think you were born in seven months.

2:07:54.042 --> 2:07:56.875
If you had stayed in for two more months.
Your hearing would have been better.

2:07:56.958 --> 2:07:59.167
You don't need to apologize.

2:07:59.500 --> 2:08:03.292
Don't worry, I will bear all the expenses
of your child.

2:08:03.375 --> 2:08:04.750
Remember what I had told you?

2:08:05.083 --> 2:08:08.292
I am the only uncle,
but I have a lot of desires.

2:08:08.375 --> 2:08:09.500
Sir!

2:08:10.042 --> 2:08:11.250
Congratulations.

2:08:11.875 --> 2:08:13.875
Sir! Congratulations!

2:08:14.458 --> 2:08:17.667
Congratulations! Many, many congrats.
Please have some sweets.

2:08:18.458 --> 2:08:19.500
What's the occasion?

2:08:19.583 --> 2:08:22.667
He didn't invite me but of course
I'll celebrate,

2:08:22.792 --> 2:08:27.208
-my employer's fourth marriage.
-She too knows about the four kids?

2:08:27.292 --> 2:08:31.625
-What? Sir, you have four kids as well?
-No, you are misunderstanding him.

2:08:31.708 --> 2:08:34.083
Come on, sir!
You hid your wives from everyone,

2:08:34.250 --> 2:08:37.625
you hid four kids as well.
Now I will tell everyone.

2:08:37.917 --> 2:08:39.917
-Madam! Madam, listen!
-Hey Champa!

2:08:40.000 --> 2:08:41.875
-There is good news.
-Have you lost your mind? Listen to me.

2:08:41.958 --> 2:08:43.625
He is going with her
to distribute the sweets.

2:08:43.958 --> 2:08:45.708
Newborn does bring such joy.

2:08:46.500 --> 2:08:49.708
-When are you getting married?
-Brother, I am still just a kid.

2:08:50.042 --> 2:08:53.250
I know you are a lawyer,
but you will get married, won't you?

2:08:53.417 --> 2:08:55.208
There is a girl whom I consider
to be my sister.

2:08:55.333 --> 2:09:00.583
All she talks about is marriage.
But look, she too found a groom today.

2:09:00.667 --> 2:09:03.917
-Really? Who? Me?
-You.

2:09:04.500 --> 2:09:05.917
Congratulations.

2:09:07.917 --> 2:09:10.833
See? Tragedies can happen to anyone.

2:09:11.417 --> 2:09:13.500
Just pray that no one
gets married accidentally.

2:09:13.917 --> 2:09:16.708
Nobody else loses anything.
They only have to give away a Laddoo.

2:09:30.375 --> 2:09:33.875
Lift your collar and have loads of fun

2:09:36.708 --> 2:09:40.542
Make the torn jeans your style statement

2:09:43.042 --> 2:09:49.750
Lift your collar and have loads of fun
Make the torn jeans your style statement

2:09:49.833 --> 2:09:52.417
Dance in such a way

2:09:52.917 --> 2:09:56.083
That you break all the records

2:09:56.333 --> 2:09:59.833
Pull the wire
Break the speaker

2:09:59.917 --> 2:10:04.625
You will look like a hero,
Wearing sunglasses

2:10:11.625 --> 2:10:13.000
Hey DJ, play the music

2:10:14.625 --> 2:10:17.792
When the DJ will play the music,
Pappu will dance

2:10:20.792 --> 2:10:24.458
When the DJ will play the music,
Pappu will dance

2:10:24.542 --> 2:10:27.917
When the DJ will play the music,
Pappu will dance

2:10:37.583 --> 2:10:40.917
Who shall I love?
Whose eyes do I look into?

2:10:41.000 --> 2:10:44.167
I have her and her as well
Who do I wait for?

2:10:44.250 --> 2:10:47.292
I am a little romantic and a little crazy

2:10:47.458 --> 2:10:50.875
There are girls everywhere
And I am surrounded by them

2:10:59.917 --> 2:11:03.167
You be

2:11:03.417 --> 2:11:06.333
You be out of control

2:11:06.500 --> 2:11:10.208
Come on now

2:11:10.333 --> 2:11:17.250
-You beat the drum till it tears apart
-Today I have caught a music fever

2:11:19.583 --> 2:11:24.042
Let me stay the way I am
Don't change the state

2:11:26.583 --> 2:11:30.125
Dance in such a way
That you break all the records

2:11:30.208 --> 2:11:33.375
Pull the wire
Break the speaker

2:11:33.542 --> 2:11:38.042
You will look like a hero
Wear the sunglasses

2:11:38.708 --> 2:11:39.625
What do you say?

2:11:39.958 --> 2:11:41.292
Hey DJ, play the music

2:11:41.375 --> 2:11:44.458
When the DJ will play the music,
Pappu will dance

2:11:47.500 --> 2:11:51.167
When the DJ will play the music,
Pappu will dance

2:11:54.458 --> 2:11:57.833
When the DJ will play the music,
Pappu will dance

2:12:01.042 --> 2:12:04.250
When the DJ will play the music,
Pappu will dance

2:12:04.333 --> 2:12:07.625
When the DJ will play the music,
Pappu will dance

2:12:07.708 --> 2:12:10.792
Pappu! Pappu!
Come on, dance

2:12:10.875 --> 2:12:14.083
Pappu! Pappu!
Come on, dance

2:12:14.167 --> 2:12:17.333
