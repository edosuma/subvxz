WEBVTT

00:01.117 --> 00:03.815
So... cellular mitosis
is what?

00:03.816 --> 00:05.032
I miss Troy.

00:05.033 --> 00:06.667
Wrong, and stop guessing that.

00:06.668 --> 00:08.169
Annie.
I'm worried about Abed.

00:08.170 --> 00:10.087
He hasn't left the apartment
since Troy moved out.

00:10.088 --> 00:11.872
He won't even play
in the Dreamatorium.

00:11.873 --> 00:13.007
Sorry, not "play."

00:13.008 --> 00:14.308
"Render
imaginated dreamscapes."

00:14.309 --> 00:17.545
Guys, we just finished
retaking biology all summer,

00:17.546 --> 00:19.764
and if I don't pass this final,
it was for nothing.

00:19.765 --> 00:21.148
Can we stay on target?

00:21.149 --> 00:23.601
Did someone say
"sexy construction worker"?

00:23.602 --> 00:25.152
- Ooh!
- Stay... stay on target.

00:25.153 --> 00:26.554
I'm dressed like this

00:26.555 --> 00:30.024
<i>because I'm building
to big news.</i>

00:30.025 --> 00:32.994
Subway has officially ended
its agreement with Greendale,

00:32.995 --> 00:34.829
and the restaurant I've chosen

00:34.830 --> 00:38.583
to occupy the cafeteria
kiosk is...

00:38.584 --> 00:39.584
Shirley's Sandwiches!

00:40.702 --> 00:43.671
I just need one of you
to sign this

00:43.672 --> 00:45.256
as the official owner
of the business.

00:45.257 --> 00:47.416
Ooh, we should both sign it,
we're 50-50 partners.

00:47.423 --> 00:49.393
But there's only one
dotted line on the form, so...

00:49.411 --> 00:51.176
- Oh, well, Pierce can...
- Me.

00:51.213 --> 00:52.550
- Hey!
- I paid for it.

00:52.564 --> 00:53.843
Well, there'd be no "it"
to pay for

00:53.858 --> 00:55.109
if I hadn't done all the work.

00:55.130 --> 00:58.653
My goodness, this molehill
is becoming a mountain.

00:58.720 --> 00:59.804
You guys work it out,

00:59.805 --> 01:01.722
while I put together
an Alpine costume.

01:01.723 --> 01:03.941
I knew eventually
you'd try to box me out

01:03.942 --> 01:06.360
of my own business,
just like Hawthorne Wipes did.

01:06.361 --> 01:07.662
I'm not letting you guilt me

01:07.663 --> 01:10.031
into letting you call yourself
the owner of my company.

01:10.922 --> 01:12.704
Jeff! Hello?

01:12.734 --> 01:14.619
- Get involved.
- No.

01:14.620 --> 01:17.237
I am here to replace
my fake bachelor's

01:17.238 --> 01:19.624
so I can get back
to my life as a lawyer.

01:19.625 --> 01:21.542
Nobody else is sacrificing
their interests.

01:21.543 --> 01:22.710
Don't ask me to sacrifice mine.

01:22.711 --> 01:25.258
Don't ask me to sacrifice mine.

01:31.928 --> 01:34.100
- Ooh, I gotta go.
- Unbelievable.

01:34.139 --> 01:36.057
Today is Abed's
first therapy session.

01:36.058 --> 01:36.808
His what?

01:36.829 --> 01:38.746
He's been feeling
extra vulnerable lately

01:38.777 --> 01:41.228
having lost Troy to the air
conditioning repair school,

01:41.229 --> 01:42.697
so he's finally gonna let me

01:42.698 --> 01:44.932
practice my psych skills
on him.

01:44.933 --> 01:46.317
Give me some credit, Winger.

01:46.318 --> 01:47.568
What's the worst
that could happen?

01:47.569 --> 01:48.836
Classic tee-up.

01:48.837 --> 01:50.988
Shut up, Leonard,
I know about your crooked wang.

01:50.989 --> 01:53.291
No such thing as bad press.

01:57.546 --> 02:00.498
Hey, Abed.

02:06.305 --> 02:07.788
This can't be good.

02:10.291 --> 02:13.561
♪ Give me some rope
tie me to dream ♪

02:13.562 --> 02:16.797
♪ Give me the hope
to run out of steam ♪

02:16.798 --> 02:20.134
♪ Somebody said
it could be here ♪

02:20.135 --> 02:23.971

tied up, dead in a year ♪

02:23.972 --> 02:29.026
♪ I can't count
the reasons I should stay ♪

02:29.027 --> 02:33.531

Sync and corrections by Elderfel

Resync for WEB-DL by Norther

02:36.354 --> 02:40.988
There are those who ask,
why connect the capillary tube

02:40.989 --> 02:43.624
directly to
the compressor valve?

02:43.625 --> 02:45.259
Oh, sure,
why not just attach it

02:45.260 --> 02:46.961
to the moisture accumulator?

02:46.962 --> 02:49.337
Hey, Troy.

02:49.356 --> 02:51.590
We boring you?
I miss my friends.

02:51.629 --> 02:54.731
- He misses his friends.
- Aww.

02:54.936 --> 02:56.470
Mr. Barnes...

02:56.471 --> 02:59.678
Gather your things
and come with me.

03:00.576 --> 03:02.086
Now!

03:02.110 --> 03:04.862
The sun chamber.
A shameful relic

03:04.863 --> 03:07.181
from a savage chapter
of our history.

03:07.182 --> 03:09.617
Repairmen would duel
each other inside,

03:09.618 --> 03:13.360
losers succumbing
to heat exhaustion, or worse.

03:13.507 --> 03:17.499
- Troy, there is a prophesy.
- I miss Abed so much.

03:17.545 --> 03:21.050
I'm ashamed to confess
that I once thought

03:21.269 --> 03:23.824
that this might be me.

03:23.905 --> 03:26.610
Now I realize that it's you.

03:26.770 --> 03:28.738
You are
the true repairman, Troy.

03:29.012 --> 03:32.091
You fix not only
air conditioners...

03:32.242 --> 03:34.367
but the men who fix them.

03:35.267 --> 03:38.772
It's a trade school.
It's a two-year degree

03:38.832 --> 03:41.250
in boxes that make rooms cold.

03:41.251 --> 03:43.924
Sir, there's been a flow duct
rupture in quadrant four.

03:43.947 --> 03:45.114
I'll handle it.

03:45.155 --> 03:47.206
This is your destiny,
Mr. Barnes.

03:47.371 --> 03:51.925
The true repairman
will repair man.

03:56.735 --> 03:58.118
Abed.

03:58.168 --> 04:00.169
I'm not talking to you
because I'm not crazy.

04:00.170 --> 04:01.804
Think of it as inner dialogue.

04:01.805 --> 04:04.173
<i>I'm reading the novelization
of Chronicles of Riddick.</i>

04:04.174 --> 04:05.892
Can you honestly tell me
that's a saner decision?

04:05.893 --> 04:08.744
You're worried
you'll go crazy without Troy.

04:08.745 --> 04:10.980
That's why you're gonna
let Britta fix you, right?

04:10.981 --> 04:12.281
Because you think
you're broken,

04:12.282 --> 04:13.816
you're gonna get diagnosed
by someone who said

04:13.817 --> 04:15.651
her favorite superhero
was "x-man"?

04:15.652 --> 04:18.237
I'm a little scared.
Things are bad.

04:18.238 --> 04:19.488
When the world
gets bad enough, Abed,

04:19.488 --> 04:23.242
the good go crazy.
But the smart...

04:23.243 --> 04:25.962
They go bad.

04:25.963 --> 04:28.231
Come on in here,
let's talk about it.

04:28.232 --> 04:29.632
I think it's safer
if I talk to Britta.

04:29.633 --> 04:31.533
I think it's even safer
if I talk to her first.

04:33.270 --> 04:35.471
Hello.

04:35.472 --> 04:37.473
Are you here to help me
with biology,

04:37.474 --> 04:38.925
or get me to help you?

04:38.926 --> 04:41.894
- Bi-ol-o-gy.
- Are you lying?

04:41.895 --> 04:44.447
Hard to break the word "yes"
into lilting syllables, huh?

04:44.448 --> 04:46.715
Ye-es?

04:46.716 --> 04:48.351
Look, Pierce and I are so close

04:48.352 --> 04:49.652
to getting the sandwich
shop going.

04:49.653 --> 04:51.028
- I just need you to help...
- Look.

04:51.057 --> 04:52.637
You want one piece
of free advice?

04:52.659 --> 04:54.093
Let Pierce cool down.

04:54.103 --> 04:56.037
You know how crazy
and paranoid he can get.

04:56.038 --> 04:58.957
A-ha! Crazy?
Paranoid? Impotent?

04:58.958 --> 05:01.126
- Cellular...
- I knew you'd run to Jeff,

05:01.127 --> 05:03.545
and turn him against me.
- Mitosis.

05:03.546 --> 05:05.013
Guys, why are we yelling?

05:05.014 --> 05:07.332
- You sign that paper, I'll sue.
- Well, hold on.

05:07.333 --> 05:10.802
This will be settled
in Greendale court, 3:00 P.M.

05:10.803 --> 05:12.888
Obviously, Shirley
has her counsel,

05:12.889 --> 05:15.440
and I get to dress
like a judge.

05:15.441 --> 05:16.808
I was born in a courtroom,

05:16.809 --> 05:19.628
sued it for my own placenta,
and won.

05:19.629 --> 05:21.012
Now I'm calling my lawyer.

05:22.031 --> 05:27.035
My biology final
is at 5:00.

05:27.036 --> 05:30.238
I'm available
from 3:00 to 4:00.

05:30.239 --> 05:32.357
I'll see you in court.

05:32.358 --> 05:34.826
Hello, Abed?
Ready to get therapized?

05:34.827 --> 05:38.079
Abed?

05:46.205 --> 05:47.188
Hello, Britta.

05:50.343 --> 05:52.761
Come in.

05:53.614 --> 05:55.270
What's going on?

05:55.314 --> 05:58.066
Vice Dean Laybourne was
repairing a flow duct rupture,

05:58.067 --> 06:00.101
and he inhaled
a lethal dose of freon.

06:07.577 --> 06:10.946
May his breeze join the wind.

06:13.532 --> 06:16.418
Okay, so mitosis
is when cells divide...

06:16.419 --> 06:18.370
I wonder who Pierce is
gonna get to represent him.

06:18.371 --> 06:20.372
I promise,
whoever Pierce brings

06:20.373 --> 06:23.124
won't be prepared for me.
That's the Winger guaran...

06:23.125 --> 06:24.676
Is that the cold-blooded
former colleague

06:24.677 --> 06:26.177
that got you fired
from your old law firm

06:26.178 --> 06:27.762
by ratting on you
to the state bar?

06:27.763 --> 06:28.763
Tee.

06:35.006 --> 06:36.608
So is this a conflict of interest?

06:36.650 --> 06:38.800
You know, Alan working
at your former firm and all?

06:38.801 --> 06:41.002
Hey, Pierce just did you
the biggest favor of your life.

06:41.003 --> 06:43.421
He hired a guy I've spent
the last two years fantasizing

06:43.422 --> 06:44.723
about stabbing
in the... Sundance!

06:44.724 --> 06:46.474
- Tango!
- Hey.

06:46.475 --> 06:50.362
So... The case
of the sandwich signature.

06:50.363 --> 06:51.496
What are you doing here?

06:51.497 --> 06:52.781
I mean, me, I have to, but you?

06:52.782 --> 06:54.182
Hawthorne's a cash cow,

06:54.183 --> 06:56.935
and old a-con here
is tugging at that teat.

06:56.936 --> 06:59.771
That's money.

06:59.772 --> 07:01.072
Money.

07:01.073 --> 07:02.557
Please stop that.

07:02.558 --> 07:06.111
So full disclosure.
The firm would really like

07:06.112 --> 07:09.864
to keep vitamin "p"
in its medicine chest.

07:09.865 --> 07:10.882
Full disclosure.

07:10.898 --> 07:12.248
I really want to be
done by 4:00.

07:12.256 --> 07:14.881
Oh, that's the Jeff
wing basket I remember loving.

07:14.920 --> 07:16.303
Hey, just go easy on Shirley.

07:16.339 --> 07:17.922
Scout's honor, Sinead O'Connor.

07:17.923 --> 07:21.576
Oy-yay, oy-yay, the honorable
Craig Pelton presiding.

07:21.577 --> 07:24.912
First off, there's one decision

07:24.913 --> 07:26.965
I'll need your help making.

07:26.966 --> 07:29.551
<i>Judging Amy or Judge Judy?</i>

07:29.552 --> 07:31.853
You say your name is Evil Abed,

07:31.854 --> 07:34.948
which does not throw me,
because I'm a therapist.

07:34.985 --> 07:37.149
So let's talk about evil.

07:40.910 --> 07:43.176
You know what? Maybe I should
talk to Good Abed instead.

07:43.199 --> 07:45.483
Where I come from,
his name is Lame Abed.

07:45.484 --> 07:47.969
- And you come from...
- The darkest timeline.

07:47.970 --> 07:49.571
You might call it
the Britta of timelines,

07:49.572 --> 07:50.739
where everything is the worst.

07:50.740 --> 07:53.153
Jeff has one arm there.
Annie shot Pierce.

07:53.176 --> 07:54.353
- Troy can't speak...
- Ah!

07:54.366 --> 07:57.805
Now we're getting somewhere.
I think lame Abed sent you

07:57.828 --> 08:01.010
to talk because you're more
equipped to deal with fear.

08:01.097 --> 08:03.074
That's the lame way
of seeing it, yes.

08:03.136 --> 08:04.784
Here's the truth.

08:04.804 --> 08:06.521
I've crossed
into your dark timeline,

08:06.522 --> 08:07.856
and now I'm going to darken it.

08:08.357 --> 08:09.557
How?

08:09.596 --> 08:11.280
Tell me about
your parents, Britta.

08:11.344 --> 08:14.780
Um... No?

08:16.632 --> 08:18.183
Barnes, you should be
in the chapel.

08:18.184 --> 08:19.801
We lost a great man today.

08:19.802 --> 08:21.236
Yeah, he was the best,
wasn't he?

08:21.237 --> 08:22.854
That's why I don't understand

08:22.855 --> 08:25.874
how he could rupture
a freon line.

08:25.875 --> 08:27.158
That's kind of
a rookie mistake.

08:27.159 --> 08:29.144
I'm sure it was just
a faulty valve.

08:29.145 --> 08:30.328
My first order as vice Dean,

08:30.329 --> 08:31.529
I'm gonna have them
all replaced.

08:31.530 --> 08:32.914
So you're vice Dean now?

08:32.914 --> 08:35.332
Why the sudden interest
in air conditioning repair?

08:35.333 --> 08:36.400
I thought you missed
your friends.

08:36.402 --> 08:38.253
- I do.
- Then go be with them.

08:38.254 --> 08:39.254
I'm releasing you.

08:39.255 --> 08:41.956
- But you...
- Goodbye, Troy.

08:46.762 --> 08:50.265
Miss Edison, do you recognize
the baby in that picture?

08:50.266 --> 08:52.300
That's Shirley's baby Ben.

08:52.301 --> 08:55.353
Would you think less
of Shirley Bennett

08:55.354 --> 08:58.973
if she offered
to sell Ben on craigslist

08:58.974 --> 09:01.893
for a chance
to bump it with Denzel?

09:01.894 --> 09:03.395
That was a joke for my cousin.

09:03.396 --> 09:05.346
Damn those Facebook
privacy settings.

09:05.347 --> 09:07.031
- Jeff, do something.
- He's got nothing.

09:07.032 --> 09:08.283
I'm sure she didn't mean that.

09:08.284 --> 09:12.654
Or perhaps she doesn't
even love that baby,

09:12.655 --> 09:16.408
because she spent most
of last year not even knowing

09:16.409 --> 09:18.243
who the father is.
- Objection.

09:18.244 --> 09:19.694
Establishing character,
your honor.

09:19.695 --> 09:21.696
This woman is clearly unfit
to own a sandwich shop.

09:21.697 --> 09:23.298
Alan, come on.

09:23.299 --> 09:24.999
No furths.

09:28.971 --> 09:30.338
I thought you said
you were gonna go easy.

09:30.339 --> 09:32.056
Felt easy to me.

09:33.709 --> 09:35.543
What was he wearing?

09:35.544 --> 09:37.312
He was dressed as a dinosaur.

09:37.313 --> 09:38.430
Is that why you dropped
out of High School?

09:38.431 --> 09:39.431
I don't know.

09:39.432 --> 09:41.483
- Are those even real glasses?
- No.

09:41.484 --> 09:43.318
Ah, do you feel that, Britta?

09:43.319 --> 09:47.105
- Your timeline's 10% darker now.
- This was 10%?

09:47.106 --> 09:49.507
Do you know what kind of person
becomes a psychologist, Britta?

09:49.508 --> 09:51.058
A person that wishes,
deep down,

09:51.059 --> 09:52.827
that everyone more special
than them was sick,

09:52.828 --> 09:55.497
because "healthy" sounds so much
more exciting than "boring."

09:55.498 --> 09:57.242
You're average, Britta Perry.

09:57.250 --> 09:58.565
You're every kid
on the playground

09:58.572 --> 09:59.917
that didn't get picked on.

10:00.041 --> 10:01.341
You're a business casual
potted plant,

10:01.342 --> 10:02.960
a human white sale.

10:02.961 --> 10:05.829
<i>You're VH1, Robocop 2,
and Back to the Future 3.</i>

10:05.830 --> 10:07.798
You're the center slice
of a square cheese pizza.

10:07.799 --> 10:09.149
Actually, that
sounds delicious.

10:09.150 --> 10:11.218
I'm the center slice
of a square cheese pizza.

10:11.219 --> 10:12.719
You're Jim Belushi.

10:12.720 --> 10:15.739
Ah.

10:15.740 --> 10:18.225
12%

10:18.226 --> 10:20.611
Where are you going?

10:20.612 --> 10:22.446
To make this timeline
the darkest of all.

10:22.447 --> 10:24.715
Starting with your lame hero,
Jeff Winger.

10:24.716 --> 10:26.600
I don't suppose lame Abed
owns a bone saw.

10:28.000 --> 10:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:44.502 --> 10:46.940
So, Pierce, you're seeking
full ownership

10:46.970 --> 10:48.271
of Shirley's Sandwiches.

10:48.311 --> 10:52.063
After all, you did provide
100% of the financing.

10:52.086 --> 10:52.913
Correct.

10:52.963 --> 10:56.033
You really did?
Oh, damn it.

10:56.091 --> 10:57.832
Jeez, I came to this
thing unprepared.

10:57.890 --> 11:01.676
I mean, I-I guess it's my job
to somehow tarnish you

11:01.684 --> 11:03.728
in the eyes of the court,
but, uh...

11:04.199 --> 11:06.638
- Let me check my notes.
- Take your time.

11:06.673 --> 11:07.848
Thanks.

11:07.892 --> 11:10.894
Hey, uh, while
I'm doing this...

11:10.895 --> 11:12.896
Does anybody know
any funny jokes?

11:12.897 --> 11:14.114
I do.

11:14.115 --> 11:18.029
An Irish and a Jew walk
into a Chinese laundry...

11:18.415 --> 11:19.663
With a gay duck.

11:20.405 --> 11:21.955
- All right, okay!
- Oh, right!

11:21.956 --> 11:23.957
So you're telling me they're
not good at basketball?

11:23.958 --> 11:25.459
I have no questions,
your honor.

11:37.855 --> 11:39.556
Cruel.
Cruel, cruel, cruel.

11:39.557 --> 11:41.224
In the name
of the five winds...

11:41.225 --> 11:44.227
East, West, North,

11:44.228 --> 11:46.530
the one we keep secret,
and South,

11:46.531 --> 11:49.066
I hereby proclaim you...

11:49.067 --> 11:50.484
This ceremony is a lie.

11:50.485 --> 11:52.035
And having
a special room for it

11:52.036 --> 11:53.787
is a waste
of valuable floor space.

11:53.788 --> 11:55.789
You are no longer
a student here.

11:55.790 --> 11:58.625
And we use this room
for yoga on weekends.

11:58.626 --> 12:01.411
- Remove him.
- I am the truest repairman.

12:02.961 --> 12:05.000
And this man is a dishonor

12:05.049 --> 12:06.333
to making air conditioners
work good.

12:06.334 --> 12:07.918
And I have the right
to challenge him...

12:09.247 --> 12:11.021
In the sun chamber.

12:11.949 --> 12:13.825
Holy crap.

12:13.858 --> 12:16.259
Your less than honor,
can I call a recess?

12:16.260 --> 12:17.961
Ooh, yay, costume change.

12:17.962 --> 12:19.596
Court briefly adjourned.

12:19.597 --> 12:22.099
What are you trying
to do, Winger?

12:22.100 --> 12:24.351
Zealously represent
your client?

12:24.352 --> 12:27.521
Let me make things
a little easier for you.

12:27.522 --> 12:29.406
Figure out a way
to throw this case,

12:29.407 --> 12:31.358
or figure out
where you're gonna work

12:31.359 --> 12:33.143
when you get out of here,
because I don't know

12:33.144 --> 12:34.778
where it's gonna be
if it's not for us.

12:34.779 --> 12:36.780
That's right, Jeff.
I went there.

12:36.781 --> 12:40.417
You drove me there.
Miss Daisy's in the house,

12:40.418 --> 12:42.502
thanks for the ride,
sorry about slavery.

12:42.503 --> 12:43.704
Don't oversell
your clout, Alan.

12:43.705 --> 12:45.455
You're partner
because I sold you to Ted.

12:45.456 --> 12:47.424
- Ted respects me...
- Ted's gone.

12:47.425 --> 12:50.660
He got too old, couldn't swim
with the sharks, and got eaten.

12:50.661 --> 12:52.328
That makes no sense.
He started the firm.

12:52.329 --> 12:54.347
- You can't lose your own firm.
- You can if you're dead.

12:54.348 --> 12:56.850
That shark thing
was not a metaphor.

12:56.851 --> 12:58.018
I'm the big dog now.

12:58.019 --> 13:01.171
So you want
the last three years

13:01.172 --> 13:03.557
in this toilet to have a point?

13:03.558 --> 13:05.892
Then I'm the guy
you got to make happy.

13:05.893 --> 13:07.694
Or, you know, you could
finish up your big win here.

13:07.695 --> 13:09.396
Court is in session.

13:09.397 --> 13:13.650
Blind Justice presiding...
aah! Oh, my God!

13:13.651 --> 13:17.070
Ahh!
Oh, one more recess.

13:17.071 --> 13:19.522
I hit the corner
right on a fresh tattoo.

13:21.318 --> 13:23.670
Well boys and girls...

13:23.718 --> 13:27.230
I hope you brought
your popsicles,

13:27.249 --> 13:31.569
because it's about
to get scalding hot

13:31.593 --> 13:34.601
in the sun chamber.

13:34.638 --> 13:37.387
You already know the rules...

13:37.432 --> 13:41.330
Because there aren't any!

13:41.372 --> 13:43.669
Jeez, Dennis, are you on coke?

13:43.831 --> 13:46.105
Take that crap off
and sit down.

13:47.525 --> 13:50.561
Sorry about that.
Of course there are rules.

13:50.562 --> 13:52.613
Two men are sealed
in the chamber,

13:52.614 --> 13:54.005
each with a broken unit.

13:54.041 --> 13:56.375
The heat will increase
until one man yields...

13:56.517 --> 13:57.517
or dies.

13:57.518 --> 14:00.154
Begin!

14:10.982 --> 14:13.717
You're just in time
for Jeff's closing statements.

14:13.718 --> 14:15.703
Who cares?
Everything is terrible.

14:15.704 --> 14:18.205
<i>Oh, no. Have you been
watching Dance Moms again?</i>

14:18.206 --> 14:19.757
I'm thinking of dyeing my hair.

14:22.377 --> 14:23.644
Evil Abed, what are you doing?

14:23.645 --> 14:24.878
I'm going to cut off
Jeff Winger's arm.

14:24.879 --> 14:26.096
I won't let you.
That's horrible.

14:26.097 --> 14:29.483
Don't you mean dark?
Welcome to my world.

14:35.824 --> 14:38.108
Psst! Jeff! Winger!

14:42.364 --> 14:44.331
Jeffrey, this is a...
a terrible situation

14:44.332 --> 14:45.699
for me to have put you in.

14:45.700 --> 14:48.402
A guy like Alan isn't above
making trouble for you

14:48.403 --> 14:50.337
at your old firm.
- Shirley, I...

14:50.338 --> 14:52.840
It's not worth your career.

14:52.841 --> 14:55.281
I want you to have
what you want.

14:56.712 --> 14:58.630
- Thank you, Shirley.
- Settle down.

14:58.647 --> 15:02.006
Okay, Jeffrey, let's have
your closing statement.

15:33.164 --> 15:34.698
Your honor...

15:34.699 --> 15:37.301
I have no closing statement,
because I'm throwing the case.

15:37.302 --> 15:39.053
- No, no, it's okay.

15:39.054 --> 15:40.421
It's fine, don't worry.

15:40.422 --> 15:42.973
My client, Shirley Bennett,
my friend of three years,

15:42.974 --> 15:44.558
she told me that it was okay.

15:44.559 --> 15:48.645
She said what I want
was more important.

15:48.646 --> 15:51.548
She's right, right?

15:51.549 --> 15:53.367
I mean, guys like me,

15:53.368 --> 15:54.985
we'll tell you
there's no right or wrong.

15:54.986 --> 15:57.271
There's no real truth.

15:58.273 --> 15:59.356
I'll kill you.

15:59.357 --> 16:02.159
I'll kill you
just like I killed him.

16:02.160 --> 16:05.028
And as long as
we all believe that,

16:05.029 --> 16:07.281
guys like me can never lose.

16:07.282 --> 16:09.032
Was that out loud?

16:09.033 --> 16:11.535
Because the truth is...

16:11.536 --> 16:14.705
I'm lying when I say
there is no truth.

16:14.706 --> 16:18.926
The truth is...
the pathetically, stupidly,

16:18.927 --> 16:22.596
inconveniently obvious
truth is...

16:22.597 --> 16:27.351
Helping only ourselves is bad,
and helping each other is good.

16:27.352 --> 16:30.721
Now I just wanted
to get out of here,

16:30.722 --> 16:32.806
pass biology,
and be a lawyer again

16:32.807 --> 16:34.108
instead of helping Shirley.

16:34.109 --> 16:35.309
That was bad.

16:35.310 --> 16:36.894
And my former colleague

16:36.895 --> 16:40.397
wanted so badly
to keep his rich client

16:40.398 --> 16:42.699
that he just asked me
to roll over

16:42.700 --> 16:44.318
in exchange for my old job.

16:45.820 --> 16:49.106
So I guess we all walked
in here pretty bad.

16:49.107 --> 16:51.625
But now...

16:51.626 --> 16:53.460
Shirley's gone good.

16:53.461 --> 16:54.611
Shirley's helping me.

16:54.612 --> 16:56.380
It's that easy.

16:56.381 --> 16:59.750
You just stop thinking
about what's good for you,

16:59.751 --> 17:02.803
and start thinking about
what's good for someone else.

17:10.627 --> 17:14.314
And you can change
the whole game

17:14.315 --> 17:15.933
with one move.

17:21.189 --> 17:24.825
Now if you like this idea,
you can make it true

17:24.826 --> 17:27.828
by doing something good
for everyone here.

17:27.829 --> 17:31.615
Throw this case out of court.
It's dumb.

17:31.616 --> 17:34.067
That is all.

17:34.068 --> 17:36.170
I withdraw my case.

17:36.171 --> 17:37.754
Why didn't you just do some

17:37.755 --> 17:39.671
inspirational speech
about friendship?

17:39.698 --> 17:41.749
You're fired.

17:47.849 --> 17:50.184
Way to go, soft serve.
You're finished.

17:50.185 --> 17:53.086
By the way, never got a chance
to tell you this,

17:53.087 --> 17:55.189
but it was me who turned you
in to the state bar.

17:55.190 --> 17:56.890
I know.

17:58.092 --> 17:59.593
And I never got
a chance to thank you.

17:59.594 --> 18:01.945
This place has made you so gay.

18:01.946 --> 18:05.365
Hey! Don't use "gay"
as a derogatory term.

18:05.366 --> 18:06.600
Booyah, good person.

18:09.270 --> 18:10.704
Gentlemen, take this man

18:10.705 --> 18:13.207
to the infinite labyrinth
of eternal ice.

18:13.208 --> 18:14.958
- Yes!
- No!

18:14.959 --> 18:18.529
No, take him to the police.

18:18.530 --> 18:21.965
He murdered someone.
Take him to jail.

18:21.966 --> 18:23.967
You guys are weird.

18:23.968 --> 18:25.719
Jeff, that was great.

18:25.720 --> 18:27.471
You were like
a white Blair Underwood.

18:27.472 --> 18:28.639
Shirley,
if you're willing, I think

18:28.640 --> 18:30.252
we should let Jeff sign
the sandwich shop form.

18:30.275 --> 18:31.550
Yeah, you could represent
both of us.

18:31.556 --> 18:32.605
You know, like our attorney.

18:32.627 --> 18:35.762
My God, Pierce!
You had your first good idea.

18:35.763 --> 18:38.632
- Thank you.
- Britta, I'm so sorry.

18:38.633 --> 18:40.100
It doesn't matter, Abed.

18:40.101 --> 18:41.935
I should've never
played therapist with you.

18:41.936 --> 18:43.803
I'll change my major
just one more time.

18:43.804 --> 18:45.239
But you can't.
You cured me.

18:45.240 --> 18:46.710
I mean, I'm not cured.
I'm willing to admit

18:46.732 --> 18:47.961
I definitely need therapy.

18:47.976 --> 18:49.693
You're the only kind
of shrink I could ever trust.

18:49.694 --> 18:51.528
The kind with as little control
over my mind as me.

18:54.282 --> 18:55.365
Mind if I cut in?

18:55.366 --> 18:58.919
Troy!

18:58.920 --> 18:59.953
You're back.

18:59.954 --> 19:02.539
Yeah, I made a new rule

19:02.540 --> 19:03.823
that the air conditioning
repair school

19:03.824 --> 19:05.425
has to act like
a regular school.

19:05.426 --> 19:07.044
I can do that
because I'm their messiah.

19:07.045 --> 19:09.463
Cool. I went crazy and
I wanted to cut off Jeff's arm.

19:09.464 --> 19:11.548
I missed you so much, buddy.

19:15.970 --> 19:17.888
So, Jeff,
we still best friends?

19:21.676 --> 19:25.178
All right.

19:25.179 --> 19:28.348
Cellular mitosis.

I'm Leonard.

20:39.720 --> 20:44.157
And I'm here today to review
Let's Potato Chips.

20:44.723 --> 20:46.792
$1.79 at Kroger's.

20:47.454 --> 20:48.641
Ah.

20:49.063 --> 20:50.597
Get this sucker open...

20:50.622 --> 20:52.506
Ah, there we are.

20:52.534 --> 20:55.369
Now, I've already had
some of these,

20:55.370 --> 20:58.072
but let's see.

20:58.073 --> 21:00.932
Mmm! Crispy. Mm-hmm.

21:01.121 --> 21:02.818
Salty, not too greasy.
