00:29.720 --> 00:31.870
<i>In the early 1960s,</i>

00:32.600 --> 00:36.479
<i>the entire world still seemed
to flow through the London docks.</i>

00:37.880 --> 00:39.916
<i>We were shown an image of plenty,</i>

00:40.000 --> 00:43.629
<i>and it encouraged us to want
and made us hungry for more.</i>

00:47.560 --> 00:51.348
<i>For some, these new luxuries
brought ease and wonder</i>

00:51.480 --> 00:53.630
<i>into tough, hard-working lives.</i>

00:53.720 --> 00:56.029
<i>But for others,
it made it more difficult</i>

00:56.120 --> 00:59.112
<i>to accept the lot that was truly theirs.</i>

00:59.240 --> 01:02.516
It's saving regular amount each week,
till it's paid off.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.227
Better than never-never.

01:04.319 --> 01:06.151
Johnny don't hold up no more credit.

01:06.360 --> 01:08.271
He should want to treat you.

01:08.360 --> 01:10.920
Mrs Beckett? Midwife's ready.

01:12.480 --> 01:15.995
Your blood pressure's a little up again.
You aren't overdoing it, are you?

01:16.280 --> 01:17.838
Chance would be a fine thing.

01:18.640 --> 01:21.996
It's just staring at four walls,
now I can't work.

01:22.600 --> 01:24.795
Flamin' tramps dustin' outside.

01:26.160 --> 01:28.037
What kind of world is that for a baby?

01:28.400 --> 01:32.393
Whenever I worry,
my father tells me to trust God.

01:32.760 --> 01:36.753
He says God has a plan, and no matter
how dark the world appears,

01:37.120 --> 01:38.758
the Sun always rises.

01:38.960 --> 01:40.951
Your old man thinks a lot of God,
don't he?

01:41.200 --> 01:43.236
I should probably add he's a vicar.

01:43.440 --> 01:46.830
Well, God don't seem too bothered
about Poplar.

01:53.920 --> 01:56.115
Breathing can ease anxiety.

01:57.080 --> 01:58.195
Deep breath in.

01:58.280 --> 02:00.510
So you can feel your chest rise.

02:00.600 --> 02:02.750
And then...

02:02.840 --> 02:04.353
Breathe out, slowly.

02:04.440 --> 02:05.440
It really can help.

02:05.520 --> 02:07.476
That's the tip, is it?

02:08.120 --> 02:09.314
Breathing?

02:11.960 --> 02:14.474
Here we have the Marlowes' product.

02:14.560 --> 02:17.870
As you can see the tin is
a very convenient size for the kitchen.

02:18.160 --> 02:22.392
Now Marlowes are the first company
to create a whey-based formula.

02:22.480 --> 02:23.754
What's all this?

02:23.960 --> 02:26.952
An exercise on behalf of
Marlowe's baby formula.

02:27.360 --> 02:30.636
A photograph
and free tin of formula for each baby.

02:31.040 --> 02:32.314
They're American.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.670
It's public relations.

02:34.760 --> 02:36.193
Propaganda, more like.

02:36.280 --> 02:38.475
So much easier for baby to digest,

02:38.640 --> 02:40.312
and enriched with vitamins.

02:40.680 --> 02:44.559
Some doctors say formula
can make baby more intelligent,

02:45.120 --> 02:46.473
more attractive.

02:46.560 --> 02:48.710
Can you really afford not to try it?

02:48.880 --> 02:50.552
Doesn't baby deserve the best?

02:50.800 --> 02:52.119
Baby has the best,

02:52.400 --> 02:54.550
The breast.

02:54.760 --> 02:55.829
This is nonsense.

02:55.920 --> 02:58.673
Nonsense, offering mothers choice?

02:58.960 --> 03:00.951
Healthy mothers don't need choice.

03:01.320 --> 03:04.039
Well, maybe she wants
to go back to work.

03:05.360 --> 03:07.032
Maybe, she wants her shape back.

03:07.120 --> 03:09.793
It's just shillings and pence to you,
isn't it?

03:10.200 --> 03:11.872
You're all charlatans.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.351
Perhaps we should get on with clinic.

03:14.800 --> 03:16.791
You have Mrs Manley.

03:16.920 --> 03:18.319
Oh, come on, Connie.

03:18.920 --> 03:21.639
You can tear yourself away
from Professor Flimflam, here.

03:25.040 --> 03:26.359
Cup of tea?

03:27.320 --> 03:29.754
How are you getting on with the shells?

03:31.320 --> 03:32.594
Do I have to keep on with them?

03:32.680 --> 03:35.240
Yes, because they're doing their job.

03:36.520 --> 03:38.317
They're drawing out your nipples.

03:38.560 --> 03:41.279
And we can't feed baby
with inverted nipples, can we?

03:42.160 --> 03:44.310
That formula looked ever so tempting.

03:44.480 --> 03:46.550
I thought you had more sense than that.

03:46.720 --> 03:48.631
You're a healthy young woman.

03:48.720 --> 03:52.952
And what you can give your baby,
no fancy slogan or doctor can better.

03:54.080 --> 03:55.718
It's practically a sea view.

03:56.240 --> 03:58.595
Imagine we're dining in Saint-Tropez
with David Niven.

03:59.120 --> 04:01.634
Quite what he'd make
of cockles and chips, I don't know.

04:01.760 --> 04:04.115
It's David Niven,
it doesn't matter what you're eating.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.195
There are chips going uneaten,
Nurse Franklin.

04:09.280 --> 04:11.669
While not an emergency,
it is a cause for concern.

04:12.440 --> 04:15.557
Patient show no sign of elation
in the presence of deep-fried matter.

04:17.279 --> 04:18.759
I don't know what it is.

04:19.040 --> 04:21.076
I'm trying to look after Mrs Beckett.

04:21.279 --> 04:23.999
She's got high blood pressure
and she's very anxious,

04:24.440 --> 04:25.953
but she won't talk to me.

04:26.440 --> 04:29.637
Whatever I say, she makes me feel
like I'm straight out of Malory Towers.

04:30.560 --> 04:32.630
It's the same for all of us
at the start.

04:32.880 --> 04:34.233
It's about building trust.

04:34.680 --> 04:36.272
But I'm not new any more.

04:36.360 --> 04:37.713
No, but you're newer.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.911
You just need a few more battle scars.

04:40.040 --> 04:41.109
I have them.

04:41.640 --> 04:43.631
I just choose not to display them.

04:45.840 --> 04:47.990
Well, we think you're wonderful.

04:48.240 --> 04:49.912
And we couldn't manage without you.

04:50.360 --> 04:53.318
And your knowledge of bundt
is quite unsurpassed.

05:01.160 --> 05:02.878
Remember dancing to this?

05:05.000 --> 05:11.000
<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

05:15.400 --> 05:17.152
Even you wouldn't mind pushing that.

05:17.920 --> 05:19.478
It's handsome, all right.

05:19.760 --> 05:22.638
Rita was saying with the mail order,
you pay for it in instalments.

05:23.040 --> 05:24.576
We ain't getting in the red for a pram.

05:24.600 --> 05:26.000
How else are we going to manage it?

05:26.520 --> 05:27.999
Cause you ain't bringing nothing in.

05:28.880 --> 05:30.520
Ain't my fault the docks
are slowing down.

05:30.680 --> 05:32.875
- You've got to try harder.
- You've got to want less.

05:36.880 --> 05:38.199
I just mean things are tight.

05:38.960 --> 05:41.428
I ain't asking for a week in Paris.

05:42.480 --> 05:43.879
It's a pram.

06:00.880 --> 06:02.313
A new system.

06:02.720 --> 06:06.429
Help us get the most
out of every day and ourselves.

06:07.320 --> 06:11.074
Each coloured pin represents
you and your patient visits.

06:11.400 --> 06:14.312
We can see straight away
if we're covering the same patch.

06:14.680 --> 06:16.955
Nurse Mount, you're on district with me.

06:17.640 --> 06:18.914
You're yellow.

06:19.200 --> 06:20.428
Not my best colour.

06:20.520 --> 06:21.520
I'm blue.

06:21.600 --> 06:26.071
Efficiency, ladies. We need to do more
and we need to do it faster.

06:26.200 --> 06:28.031
Why not simply give us
radio transmitters

06:28.120 --> 06:29.997
so we can telegraph our whereabouts.

06:30.320 --> 06:33.118
There are people in Poplar
falling through the cracks.

06:33.320 --> 06:37.598
I've persuaded the borough council
to provide a number of home helps.

06:37.680 --> 06:41.958
So, when you're on your visits, make
a note of anyone you feel cannot call.

06:42.440 --> 06:46.797
We'll put their names forward and see
if we can't make life a little easier.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.433
Mission accepted.

06:48.520 --> 06:49.520
Quite so.

06:49.600 --> 06:50.874
Oh, and while I've got you,

06:50.960 --> 06:53.599
we have visitors of many lands
now amongst us,

06:53.760 --> 06:57.469
and I thought we might equip ourselves
with languages

06:57.560 --> 06:59.073
to serve them better.

06:59.400 --> 07:03.029
I had hoped to find a class in Urdu,
or Punjabi,

07:03.240 --> 07:04.673
but these have eluded me.

07:04.880 --> 07:08.759
However, there is a module
in Spanish starting this evening.

07:09.520 --> 07:13.354
Anyone who wants to join me,
I shall be leaving at 7 o'clock.

07:13.440 --> 07:14.555
Sharp.

07:27.400 --> 07:28.833
Half the day's gone, Johnny.

07:28.920 --> 07:31.176
There's men down at the docks
from dawn waiting to take work,

07:31.200 --> 07:32.519
and you're still half asleep.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.194
There is no work.

07:36.400 --> 07:39.153
Fill it. Present your side of things.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.393
And this is mine.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.438
Midwife calling.

07:56.120 --> 07:58.111
Them tramps are back again.

07:58.320 --> 07:59.594
They ain't doing no harm.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.875
A decent man don't live on charity.

08:02.040 --> 08:03.712
He goes out and finds work.

08:04.520 --> 08:06.078
I'll pop the kettle on.

08:09.640 --> 08:10.834
- Finch?
- Yes.

08:11.320 --> 08:12.389
Fitz?

08:12.800 --> 08:14.074
- Basson?
- Sir.

08:15.200 --> 08:18.556
Tinder, Watts and the Jeremy brothers.
That's it.

08:25.280 --> 08:28.590
We want you to have baby at home,
but if your blood pressure remains high,

08:28.680 --> 08:30.238
we'll have to bring you in.

08:30.720 --> 08:31.914
It would be a relief.

08:33.440 --> 08:34.839
Oh, Mrs Beckett...

08:35.080 --> 08:36.798
Oh, please don't be upset.

08:37.520 --> 08:40.592
The thought of baby's daunting,
but you're not alone.

08:40.799 --> 08:43.030
I'm talking about having no home.

08:44.680 --> 08:48.070
In the past six months, Johnny's
brought in next to nothing in shifts,

08:48.160 --> 08:50.549
now I'm living off what my sister
can send us.

08:51.040 --> 08:53.031
I don't know how we'll make next rent.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.830
Have you applied
for national assistance?

08:56.920 --> 08:58.194
He won't beg.

08:58.480 --> 09:01.040
But the assistance board's there
for hard times.

09:01.320 --> 09:03.959
My father's parish serves
the docks in Liverpool.

09:04.200 --> 09:06.953
And he's referred many men to the board
in recent years.

09:07.040 --> 09:09.110
There's work for those who wants it.

09:09.960 --> 09:11.234
The man I married,

09:11.520 --> 09:13.556
he would have died for his family.

09:13.840 --> 09:14.875
But,

09:15.520 --> 09:17.192
Johnny ain't the same no more.

09:17.600 --> 09:20.558
Some men are overwhelmed
by the thought of fatherhood.

09:20.640 --> 09:23.154
There ain't no time to be overwhelmed.

09:25.080 --> 09:27.071
Well done, Connie.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.679
Yes!

09:42.160 --> 09:44.628
Here's your beautiful
little son, Connie.

09:49.160 --> 09:52.072
What'd I tell you?
You made that look easy.

09:52.600 --> 09:54.830
Just like your mum,
when I delivered you.

09:55.080 --> 09:56.798
I wish she were here now.

09:57.200 --> 09:59.077
She'd be very proud of you, Connie.

09:59.760 --> 10:01.034
And her little grandson.

10:01.160 --> 10:03.435
I heard crying,
I couldn't wait any longer.

10:04.080 --> 10:05.149
Oh, Connie...

10:05.240 --> 10:06.559
We got a little boy, Frankie.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.437
We are not yet done, Mr Manley,

10:08.520 --> 10:11.717
and until we are this is my delivery
room, and you will knock.

10:11.800 --> 10:13.631
Sorry, Sister,
but I do so want to see him.

10:13.840 --> 10:15.637
One quick look and then out, please.

10:15.920 --> 10:17.911
We're going to be putting baby
to the breast.

10:19.440 --> 10:21.112
Oh, he's just perfect, Connie.

10:22.160 --> 10:23.513
He's just perfect.

10:24.320 --> 10:26.038
We haven't slept,
we've been that nervous.

10:26.120 --> 10:29.556
No need for nerves, your wife
can take all this in her stride.

10:29.640 --> 10:30.993
Isn't that right, Connie?

10:32.080 --> 10:33.399
I hope so, Sister.

10:37.600 --> 10:40.194
Good evening. <i>Buenos noches a todos.</i>

10:40.800 --> 10:42.313
And welcome, everyone.

10:42.520 --> 10:43.794
I'd like to welcome Phyllis.

10:43.880 --> 10:45.836
- Ms Crane...
<i>- Hola,</i> Phyllis.

10:45.920 --> 10:48.275
Let's begin. The verb <i>ser.</i>

10:49.280 --> 10:51.271
<i>- Yo soy.
- Yo soy.</i>

10:51.720 --> 10:52.994
<i>- Tú eres.
- Tú eres.</i>

10:53.160 --> 10:55.037
<i>- Él, ella es.
- Él, ella es.</i>

10:55.480 --> 10:58.153
<i>- Nosotros, nosotras somos.
- Nosotros, nosotras somos.</i>

10:58.360 --> 11:01.113
<i>- Vosotros, vosotras sois.
- Vosotros, vosotras sois.</i>

11:01.440 --> 11:04.193
Might I say, what lovely accents
you young people have.

11:04.280 --> 11:05.838
Past tense.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.190
Oh, I've missed that sound.

11:08.400 --> 11:09.992
Ah, I'm glad you could make it, Tommy.

11:10.080 --> 11:11.274
<i>Hola,</i> Tommy.

11:13.400 --> 11:14.753
- May I?
- Oh...

11:16.640 --> 11:18.551
I don't believe
I've seen you here before.

11:18.920 --> 11:19.955
Tommy Smith.

11:20.040 --> 11:21.314
Oh, Phyllis Crane.

11:23.640 --> 11:26.029
<i>Ellos, ellas fueron.</i>

11:26.120 --> 11:27.120
<i>Ole!</i>

11:32.760 --> 11:35.035
I can't be the only one
drinking Campari.

11:36.920 --> 11:40.708
I told my class my complexion was purely
down to the lemons in my lemonade.

11:41.440 --> 11:43.396
I must live as I teach.

11:45.480 --> 11:47.357
Do we get a mention in that letter home?

11:47.800 --> 11:49.480
It's more to do with
my father's experience

11:49.520 --> 11:51.317
with the national assistance board.

11:51.520 --> 11:53.351
Advice to help Mrs Beckett.

11:53.440 --> 11:55.556
She and her husband
are having quite the struggle.

11:55.720 --> 11:57.995
How dreadfully dull for your parents.

11:58.080 --> 12:00.548
Wouldn't they rather hear about
your exciting London life?

12:00.640 --> 12:03.040
Excitement is what parents want
for other people's daughters.

12:03.440 --> 12:05.160
When I used to help my father
on his visits,

12:05.200 --> 12:06.952
he would introduce me as Barbara,

12:07.040 --> 12:08.553
his parish assistant.

12:08.720 --> 12:09.755
Oh.

12:09.840 --> 12:11.353
Black mark, Mr Gilbert, in my book.

12:11.440 --> 12:14.159
It's quite all right. It's just his way.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.470
Though I suppose when I was younger,
I did wish he might say,

12:18.720 --> 12:21.439
"This is Barbara, my daughter."

12:23.000 --> 12:25.992
So, weather mixed, work splendid.

12:26.440 --> 12:31.389
Social injustices still rife,
no accidents, injuries or boyfriends.

12:37.040 --> 12:38.598
Well goodnight, Mr Smith.

12:39.040 --> 12:41.349
May I ask, <i>señora</i> or <i>señorita?</i>

12:41.440 --> 12:42.634
It's Miss.

12:42.960 --> 12:44.791
<i>Buenas noches, señorita</i> Crane.

12:44.920 --> 12:46.353
Oh, <i>buenas noches.</i>

12:46.840 --> 12:48.910
<i>¿Puedo acompañarte a casa?</i>

12:49.040 --> 12:50.758
Now you've lost me, I'm afraid.

12:51.080 --> 12:52.433
May I walk you home?

12:52.680 --> 12:55.148
Thank you, but I have my motor car.

12:55.520 --> 12:57.078
Might I drop you somewhere?

12:57.720 --> 12:59.915
I would miss the night air of spring.

13:00.240 --> 13:02.231
I'm a flâneur, Miss Crane.

13:02.880 --> 13:07.158
Hopeless romantic, strolling through
London as if seeing anew at every turn.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.276
Oh, we can always roll the windows down.

13:11.640 --> 13:13.392
Hope to see you at the next class.

13:13.480 --> 13:14.833
I should like that.

13:19.720 --> 13:21.790
It's got spring suspension,

13:22.080 --> 13:24.799
and an anti-tip device
and look at that brake.

13:25.160 --> 13:26.878
I mean, you'd think it was ivory.

13:27.480 --> 13:29.630
We'll be the pride
of the street with this.

13:30.200 --> 13:32.350
I'm so happy for you, Mrs Beckett.

13:32.520 --> 13:33.714
For both of you.

13:33.880 --> 13:35.871
And me cursing him like I was,

13:36.880 --> 13:38.552
I can be harsh, can't I, nurse?

13:38.640 --> 13:40.631
You've had an awful lot on your plate.

13:41.560 --> 13:42.913
Yeah, you were right.

13:43.120 --> 13:46.556
It was all it is, about the baby.
But he's getting his shifts again.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.673
We're going to be all right.

13:49.160 --> 13:51.037
And your blood pressure agrees.

13:55.520 --> 13:57.033
He won't stay on the breast.

13:57.120 --> 13:59.111
He will, if you give him time.

13:59.800 --> 14:02.234
Can't I try him on a bottle of formula?
Please, Sister.

14:02.320 --> 14:04.993
I know you're struggling,
but we can't give up.

14:05.440 --> 14:08.000
This is colostrum, it's the first fluid.

14:08.160 --> 14:10.993
Nothing like it on Earth,
certainly not in formula.

14:11.520 --> 14:15.672
It's packed with goodness, and you don't
want him missing out on that, do you?

14:15.840 --> 14:18.434
We can top him up with a little water
in the meantime.

14:18.520 --> 14:20.192
But we must keep trying.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.793
Now, come on.

14:23.560 --> 14:25.551
Relax... That's it.

14:25.680 --> 14:28.433
We want the very best for baby,
don't we?

14:36.480 --> 14:38.516
So sorry. Excuse me. If I could just...

14:38.600 --> 14:39.828
Excuse me.

14:40.240 --> 14:42.196
Shift it, gents!

14:44.880 --> 14:46.199
Thank you, Florrie.

14:46.640 --> 14:47.834
You're busy today.

14:47.920 --> 14:49.592
Busy every day, dear.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.477
Are they the cooling powders?

14:51.920 --> 14:53.990
Tell her to rub just a little
on baby's gums.

14:54.080 --> 14:55.832
It will help with the teething pain.

14:56.080 --> 14:57.991
It'll help with keeping me sane.

14:58.200 --> 15:01.033
My granddaughter cries like a sea nymph.

15:01.160 --> 15:02.559
I'll see she gets it.

15:02.800 --> 15:03.915
- Ta, love.
- Bye.

15:04.920 --> 15:08.356
Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.

15:10.320 --> 15:12.834
Oh, Mr Beckett. Hello.

15:13.560 --> 15:14.560
Nurse.

15:17.280 --> 15:18.429
Early finish.

15:19.040 --> 15:20.109
Of course.

15:20.200 --> 15:22.077
Ain't you got no home to go to?

15:22.480 --> 15:24.914
Never know in a man
make a pint last longer.

15:27.680 --> 15:28.749
Nurse.

15:29.600 --> 15:32.319
I wouldn't want my wife to get
the wrong idea, you understand.

15:32.400 --> 15:33.879
I wouldn't want her worried.

15:38.360 --> 15:41.909
Baby Travers is making good weight gain
now her colic has cleared.

15:43.320 --> 15:45.197
Ah, just the person.

15:45.440 --> 15:47.112
How are we getting along with
baby Manley?

15:47.240 --> 15:48.719
Is he latching more successfully?

15:48.920 --> 15:50.956
Not yet. A little more time
and we'll get there.

15:51.080 --> 15:52.559
Perhaps we should encourage formula,

15:52.680 --> 15:54.511
if matters continue
for another day or so.

15:54.720 --> 15:57.359
Shall I include her on my list
of mothers not breastfeeding?

15:57.520 --> 15:59.192
No need to put Mrs Manley on the list.

15:59.520 --> 16:01.909
She wants to keep trying,
I've every confidence in her.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.831
Meantime we're topping him up
with water.

16:05.960 --> 16:07.393
<i>- Hola.
- Hola, señora.</i>

16:08.360 --> 16:09.395
<i>Hola.</i>

16:11.080 --> 16:12.115
Oh.

16:12.840 --> 16:14.831
Well, hope it's nothing serious.

16:15.360 --> 16:18.511
He may have a weakness in the chest,
that's why he wears those odd sweaters.

16:18.640 --> 16:20.631
I think that's the fashion.

16:21.800 --> 16:23.916
What a shame about tonight, Mr Smith.

16:24.200 --> 16:25.599
Tommy, please.

16:26.240 --> 16:28.435
Will your wife have kept you back
some tea?

16:29.320 --> 16:31.231
I lost my wife many years ago.

16:31.320 --> 16:32.469
I am sorry.

16:32.760 --> 16:34.637
That was careless of me.

16:34.760 --> 16:35.760
Miss Crane,

16:35.840 --> 16:38.400
as two scholars in want of a lesson,

16:39.240 --> 16:41.800
may I suggest we attempt it ourselves.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.518
Perhaps over a cup of tea?

16:43.600 --> 16:47.275
And, if the mood takes us,
a slice of cake?

16:48.520 --> 16:52.718
Well, given that I've put aside
this evening, I don't see why not.

16:53.320 --> 16:55.550
And please, it's Phyllis.

16:58.560 --> 16:59.993
Take care. See you tomorrow.

17:02.240 --> 17:04.070
Thank you very much.

17:08.319 --> 17:10.788
You make soup for the tramps
every night?

17:10.880 --> 17:12.279
Soup's a loose term.

17:12.359 --> 17:15.432
I make something hot and wet
for the poor devils.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.309
Every night?

17:17.920 --> 17:19.558
Everyone deserves one meal a day.

17:23.160 --> 17:24.309
Tom.

17:24.440 --> 17:27.238
What do you do when you learn something
about one parishioner

17:27.319 --> 17:29.197
that another has a right to know,

17:29.320 --> 17:33.108
but knowing would probably cause
quite a bit of upset?

17:34.040 --> 17:37.874
I deal with confidences every day.
There's no need to be quite so cryptic.

17:39.720 --> 17:41.119
One of my patients.

17:41.320 --> 17:45.108
Her husband's not been working and she
has high blood pressure with the worry.

17:45.760 --> 17:48.991
And now she things he's back in work,
and she's so relieved.

17:49.360 --> 17:50.634
But he's not working.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.679
He's in a pub all day.

17:53.040 --> 17:55.400
Well, I've never been thanked
for interfering in a marriage.

17:57.520 --> 17:59.238
I can't just stand by.

18:00.560 --> 18:02.152
You're quite the warrior, aren't you?

18:08.720 --> 18:11.154
I thought cleanliness
was close to godliness.

18:11.640 --> 18:12.834
Apparently not.

18:15.760 --> 18:17.576
I would have like to have
travelled more, I suppose.

18:17.600 --> 18:18.794
But work got in the way?

18:19.560 --> 18:23.235
I love nursing, but yes. It leaves
little time for a private life.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.511
You must see the Spanish coast.

18:25.720 --> 18:27.597
I went there several years ago.

18:28.320 --> 18:30.629
Just a smatter of fishing villages,
really.

18:31.360 --> 18:34.875
But the warmth,
smell of the flowers at night...

18:36.000 --> 18:37.399
It was magical.

18:40.080 --> 18:41.433
Do you have a motorcar?

18:41.600 --> 18:42.874
I couldn't justify it.

18:43.920 --> 18:46.753
It is an expense,
but it's freedom, Tommy.

18:47.240 --> 18:50.550
The Great North Road,
a picnic and a fine day.

18:51.160 --> 18:53.674
Rivals anything the Mediterranean
can offer.

18:53.960 --> 18:56.474
I'll hold you to that,
the next fine day.

19:10.240 --> 19:11.468
You had a drink?

19:13.040 --> 19:14.155
Just with the lads.

19:14.280 --> 19:15.315
Good for you.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.353
Back on track, aren't we?

19:19.040 --> 19:20.268
Our little family.

19:23.240 --> 19:26.915
Rita was showing me this cart and before
you say anything, it's not dear.

19:27.640 --> 19:30.279
Now you've got your shifts back,
we know where we are.

19:44.320 --> 19:47.630
Nurse Crane, I've Mr Danvers
and Miss Lane down for home health.

19:48.200 --> 19:49.553
Bravo, Nurse Mount.

19:52.560 --> 19:55.677
Long may these Spanish lessons continue.

19:56.760 --> 19:59.957
Have you ever known Nurse Crane
speak so little?

20:00.360 --> 20:02.032
Yet say so much?

20:22.920 --> 20:23.955
Mr Gibson,

20:24.040 --> 20:25.792
I don't mean to interrupt you.

20:26.440 --> 20:27.555
Keeping well, sir?

20:27.640 --> 20:29.232
Fit as a butcher's dog, Mrs Beckett.

20:29.920 --> 20:32.832
What dock's Johnny on?
He forgot his dinner.

20:33.160 --> 20:34.354
I can't be no help to you.

20:34.680 --> 20:36.033
I don't follow you, sir.

20:36.720 --> 20:38.756
I just want to know what dock
Johnny's on.

20:38.840 --> 20:40.239
Look, there's been a confusion.

20:40.320 --> 20:41.594
Johnny don't work here.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.194
But we got his shifts back.

20:44.280 --> 20:45.474
No, no. I'm afraid not.

20:45.920 --> 20:47.433
Your Johnny's been telling lies.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.354
Go home, Mrs Beckett.

20:49.520 --> 20:50.589
But he must be back.

20:52.600 --> 20:53.919
He bought the pram...

20:56.000 --> 20:57.069
Mrs Beckett?

20:57.360 --> 21:00.193
Oh, good God...
Someone fetch one of the sisters!

21:06.240 --> 21:08.276
I don't understand
how he's losing weight.

21:08.520 --> 21:09.748
I'm doing all I can.

21:09.840 --> 21:12.798
It's perfectly normal
for a little while after birth.

21:13.800 --> 21:15.756
You'll see him start putting it back on.

21:19.520 --> 21:20.748
Hmm.

21:27.280 --> 21:30.033
Connie, is it still difficult
for you, feeding?

21:30.240 --> 21:32.390
I've just got to keep going with it,
is all.

21:33.120 --> 21:35.031
Like Sister Evangelina says,
it gets easier.

21:35.120 --> 21:36.155
It does.

21:36.880 --> 21:38.438
Not always for everyone.

21:38.520 --> 21:40.795
You would say, wouldn't you,
if you needed help?

21:41.200 --> 21:43.111
The milk's where the goodness is.

21:43.320 --> 21:46.437
It's, it's where my baby gets
his best start in life from.

21:47.040 --> 21:49.998
I just got to get on with it, is all.
Like Mum did.

21:51.360 --> 21:52.918
I want to do this right, Sister.

21:53.040 --> 21:55.031
I, I want to be
the best mother I can be.

21:55.880 --> 21:58.519
Well, you don't have to manage alone.

21:58.600 --> 22:00.955
I'm here if you need
a little more support.

22:04.760 --> 22:06.910
I'd best see to him, Sister.

22:09.800 --> 22:11.597
Excuse me. I need to get through.

22:12.720 --> 22:14.278
Mr Beckett!

22:14.440 --> 22:16.795
You must go home. Your wife's collapsed.

22:17.240 --> 22:19.071
She's all right. She's resting now.

22:19.240 --> 22:21.470
But she collapsed at Mr Gibson's.

22:21.760 --> 22:23.557
Oh, strike me down. You told her!

22:23.920 --> 22:25.776
You told her I weren't working.
You had no right!

22:25.800 --> 22:28.189
She came to the dock
to bring you your lunch.

22:30.640 --> 22:34.235
My only concern is the health
of your wife and baby.

22:34.560 --> 22:35.993
If you knew how hard I tried...

22:36.080 --> 22:39.356
Mr Beckett, please, talk to your wife.

22:39.560 --> 22:42.393
What, tell her I worked like a slave
for Billy Gibson

22:42.560 --> 22:45.028
and shifted fortune in every year
in what I lifted,

22:45.120 --> 22:46.599
same as me dad, same as his,

22:46.800 --> 22:48.920
and now he's put me out
like I'm no better than a dog?

22:49.640 --> 22:51.073
Now, how do I tell my wife that?

22:52.320 --> 22:53.753
It's the truth.

22:54.880 --> 22:56.916
What other way can you tell it?

22:59.440 --> 23:01.078
I wanted
to get straight back up,

23:01.160 --> 23:02.536
I just don't have the energy tonight.

23:02.560 --> 23:03.913
My batteries are run down.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.389
It's me who's having the baby,
for crying out loud!

23:06.720 --> 23:08.119
It's just a dip.

23:08.240 --> 23:10.071
We've got each other,
that's all that matters.

23:10.160 --> 23:13.038
How, if you ain't got
the backbone to work?

23:16.400 --> 23:17.879
How'd you buy the pram?

23:18.480 --> 23:19.549
Don't matter.

23:19.720 --> 23:20.914
You pawned it, didn't you?

23:21.080 --> 23:22.195
Your docker's hook.

23:22.280 --> 23:24.396
How are you going
to get work without it?

23:24.480 --> 23:25.515
I'm sorry.

23:25.600 --> 23:27.556
That ain't enough
for more than a deposit.

23:27.640 --> 23:29.631
We don't even own that pram!

23:29.720 --> 23:30.835
Oh, God, Johnny!

23:30.920 --> 23:33.115
I'll sort it. I'll take care of us!

23:33.320 --> 23:35.550
I'm sorry, it's not my place,
but Mrs Beckett,

23:35.680 --> 23:37.830
we have to think
of your blood pressure, please!

23:37.920 --> 23:39.638
Both of you sit down, please!

23:39.880 --> 23:41.438
We need to be calm.

23:41.520 --> 23:42.794
You heard the nurse.

23:44.440 --> 23:45.475
Get out.

23:47.240 --> 23:48.514
What are you talking about?

23:48.600 --> 23:49.828
Mrs Beckett, that's not...

23:49.920 --> 23:51.558
This ain't your business!

23:53.080 --> 23:55.196
My blood pressure's all 'cause of you.

23:55.520 --> 23:56.999
You, you ain't making no sense.

23:57.080 --> 23:59.196
I've got another life in here.

24:00.440 --> 24:04.911
I can only carry this, my baby,
I can't carry you and all!

24:05.000 --> 24:07.389
You ain't no good for me!

24:11.360 --> 24:12.679
I want you gone.

24:14.320 --> 24:15.469
Er...

24:31.680 --> 24:33.671
Move! Come on,
what's the matter with you?

24:38.640 --> 24:41.256
It's good of you to come by.
Now, you be sure to give her our best.

24:41.280 --> 24:44.397
Er, actually, I'm here about Mr Beckett.

24:45.080 --> 24:48.516
It's just... It's a terrible struggle
for them at the moment.

24:48.640 --> 24:52.599
I think that Mrs Beckett's health is
suffering because Johnny has no work.

24:52.920 --> 24:54.433
I don't take petitions, nurse.

24:54.920 --> 24:57.115
You see this place?
Industry, not charity.

24:57.600 --> 25:00.239
But, surely, three generations
of one family's labour

25:00.320 --> 25:01.594
must count for something?

25:01.680 --> 25:03.159
Johnny's labour?

25:03.760 --> 25:05.671
We'd find him asleep through his shifts.

25:05.760 --> 25:07.671
Curled up like a stray
in the haulage crates.

25:09.080 --> 25:11.640
Well, perhaps
he was just under the weather.

25:11.800 --> 25:13.677
Yeah, and perhaps he was work-shy.

25:14.360 --> 25:17.079
The docks are brutal,
and I need men that's fit for them.

25:17.640 --> 25:19.278
Now, if you need a worthy cause, Miss,

25:19.680 --> 25:21.272
I suggest you find a seamen's mission.

25:21.440 --> 25:23.874
Men give you their lives, Mr Gibson.

25:24.160 --> 25:27.197
At least respect them,
even if you won't protect them.

25:32.120 --> 25:34.190
I think it was when we were
at the community centre

25:34.280 --> 25:36.280
- I really don't think so...
- Am I disturbing you?

25:36.480 --> 25:37.595
Not at all.

25:37.720 --> 25:40.598
It's just I couldn't help hearing
your gramophone the other evening.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.080
Oh, were we too loud again?

25:42.160 --> 25:44.720
No, that's by the by, for now.

25:44.800 --> 25:48.076
No, I'd wondered if you'd show me
how to use it.

25:48.160 --> 25:50.799
There's a long-playing record
I'd like to hear.

25:50.880 --> 25:52.552
Oh, how thoroughly romantic.

25:52.640 --> 25:56.235
No, it's simply to put me
in the Latin mindset.

25:56.720 --> 25:59.154
- For the Spanish.
- Of course.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.831
Then I'll do better then show it to you.

26:02.160 --> 26:03.229
I'll play it for you.

26:06.080 --> 26:09.117
I'm so glad you found something
you enjoy so much.

26:09.760 --> 26:11.716
We all need more than just our work.

26:12.640 --> 26:15.200
I sometimes think there must have been
a terrible hole in my life

26:15.280 --> 26:16.633
before Keep Fit.

26:16.720 --> 26:19.473
Charming. Those were probably
the evenings you spent with me.

26:20.320 --> 26:21.389
They weren't.

26:22.360 --> 26:24.590
Oh, can I interest anyone in
a barley sugar?

26:24.800 --> 26:26.279
Oh, yes, please.

26:27.360 --> 26:28.588
You know, I rather envy you.

26:28.800 --> 26:30.233
You live life as you please.

26:30.320 --> 26:33.995
You have your motorcar, your work
and now a genuine passion.

26:34.400 --> 26:37.790
And no-one ever bothers you with endless
questions about when you'll marry

26:37.880 --> 26:39.871
and why you don't have
a gentleman friend.

26:39.960 --> 26:42.793
Oh, we must always live as we please,

26:43.360 --> 26:45.669
as long as no-one gets hurt
in the process.

26:46.240 --> 26:48.515
Recklessness is quite another matter.

26:48.960 --> 26:51.997
But these are wonderful days, girls.

26:52.560 --> 26:55.028
Go out there and take hold of them!

26:55.520 --> 26:57.829
You're not given opportunities,

26:58.080 --> 27:01.038
you grab them with both hands.

27:01.240 --> 27:02.355
I'd adore to.

27:04.160 --> 27:06.071
I thoroughly enjoy my class,

27:06.200 --> 27:11.035
but it feels a little like grandmother
hen has landed in a nest of chicks.

27:11.120 --> 27:13.759
Well, I hope those chicks
know that grandmother

27:13.840 --> 27:16.070
has two deadly midwives on her side.

27:16.200 --> 27:18.953
- Put 'em up! Put 'em up!
- You're very kind.

27:19.240 --> 27:20.832
But there's no need.

27:24.040 --> 27:25.598
I did wonder,

27:26.720 --> 27:30.190
might it be possible for you to

27:31.400 --> 27:32.833
polish me, a little?

27:32.960 --> 27:34.359
Just a touch of powder.

27:34.840 --> 27:36.240
Something around the eyes, perhaps.

27:36.320 --> 27:37.912
Nothing dramatic.

27:42.080 --> 27:44.116
Phyllis, you look quite magnificent.

27:44.640 --> 27:46.232
I'm sure I don't know why.

27:46.760 --> 27:48.796
Mind you, this is a new cardigan.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.069
Shall we?

27:51.200 --> 27:53.080
Actually, there's something
I wanted to ask you,

27:53.160 --> 27:54.752
before we get caught up in the class.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.193
Of course, what is it?

27:56.800 --> 27:58.392
I have a half-day coming up.

27:59.520 --> 28:01.715
Now, I can't promise the weather,

28:01.800 --> 28:05.076
but I can promise you a good sandwich
and a flask of tea.

28:05.600 --> 28:08.319
I think, with a fair run,
we could get to Rutland

28:08.400 --> 28:10.277
and still be back before dark.

28:10.520 --> 28:12.272
I shall pay the petrol, of course.

28:12.480 --> 28:13.833
We should go Dutch.

28:14.280 --> 28:15.838
Then I shall buy us supper.

28:16.320 --> 28:18.629
The service station at Watford Gap.

28:18.720 --> 28:21.996
I've been itching for an excuse
to try their restaurant.

28:22.480 --> 28:24.038
So, it's a yes, then, is it?

28:24.120 --> 28:27.112
Only if I can get us tickets
for the flamenco performance

28:27.200 --> 28:28.349
at the class next week.

28:29.280 --> 28:31.475
My diary's getting rather full.

28:32.120 --> 28:33.235
So is mine.

28:43.720 --> 28:46.200
Sister, come quick, please.
It's my Connie, she's in a bad way.

28:54.320 --> 28:57.073
I told you not to call no-one!
I told you I was managing.

28:57.160 --> 28:58.479
But you know you can't feed him!

28:58.560 --> 29:00.391
Connie, please, let me help.

29:00.680 --> 29:03.592
What kind of mother can't feed
her own baby?

29:03.840 --> 29:05.273
You're bleeding.

29:06.880 --> 29:08.393
Connie, all right now.

29:08.880 --> 29:10.154
We're going to stop this.

29:10.240 --> 29:11.992
This isn't fair on you.

29:12.120 --> 29:13.758
No, I've got to keep trying.

29:13.840 --> 29:15.239
You've tried.

29:15.960 --> 29:17.279
Maybe your nipples...

29:17.360 --> 29:19.794
Perhaps the inversion's
still making it difficult.

29:21.360 --> 29:22.554
May I?

29:30.720 --> 29:32.312
When did you last change him?

29:32.560 --> 29:34.232
Hours ago. He's been as good as gold.

29:34.960 --> 29:36.598
That's because he's dehydrated.

29:37.080 --> 29:38.274
His fontanelle's depressed.

29:39.560 --> 29:41.630
His mouth's parched.
He needs fluids now.

29:42.280 --> 29:45.636
Bring me a clean spoon, some sugar
and some boiling water.

29:46.840 --> 29:49.149
I won't have him
on that charlatan's milk.

29:49.240 --> 29:50.878
Connie, what are you talking about?

29:50.960 --> 29:53.190
You know what the Sister says
about formula.

29:53.360 --> 29:56.989
"All a baby needs is what
his mother can give him."

29:57.640 --> 30:00.438
If I can't give him nothing,
what good am I?

30:02.040 --> 30:03.519
Connie, listen to me.

30:04.880 --> 30:07.030
Baby needs fluids
and he needs them quickly.

30:07.120 --> 30:09.998
So, we're going to put aside
all of those other thoughts

30:10.320 --> 30:13.153
and focus on what is best
for your little boy.

30:13.400 --> 30:14.799
Do you understand?

30:16.960 --> 30:18.188
Steady.

30:22.040 --> 30:23.234
This way, Doctor!

30:23.760 --> 30:25.113
He's just around here.

30:26.280 --> 30:27.474
All right.

30:27.680 --> 30:28.715
We found him like this.

30:28.960 --> 30:30.712
He's breathing, but he won't wake up.

30:32.480 --> 30:34.471
We need an ambulance, right away.

30:34.680 --> 30:37.240
And bring something to keep him warm.
Hurry!

30:40.240 --> 30:41.753
Like the magpie,

30:42.160 --> 30:44.833
I am enamoured of all things shiny.

30:44.920 --> 30:48.117
How about you be enamoured
of all that is yet to be tidied.

30:48.200 --> 30:51.112
Might I have a word, Sister?
In private, please.

30:52.400 --> 30:54.834
Well, the magpie, give it a go.

30:55.640 --> 30:56.709
It may.

31:08.720 --> 31:11.439
There's much to do, Sister,
so snap to it, if you would.

31:12.160 --> 31:14.594
- I've just been with Mrs Manley...
- And how's she doing?

31:15.080 --> 31:16.957
Mrs Manley cannot breastfeed.

31:17.880 --> 31:19.976
We know it's difficult,
particularly with the first baby,

31:20.000 --> 31:21.353
but we just have to keep trying.

31:21.440 --> 31:22.736
Well, no-one could have tried harder.

31:22.760 --> 31:24.876
So hard, in fact, she's bleeding.

31:25.640 --> 31:27.471
Yet still she won't consider formula

31:27.560 --> 31:29.869
because she thinks it makes her
a bad mother.

31:30.320 --> 31:31.719
You put her straight, I hope.

31:32.080 --> 31:33.559
In fact, I'll go do so myself now.

31:33.640 --> 31:36.359
I'm afraid your opinions
got there first, Sister.

31:37.480 --> 31:38.754
Whatever do you mean?

31:39.240 --> 31:42.391
She refuses to consider anything
other than the breast.

31:42.720 --> 31:44.073
But that isn't what I meant!

31:44.160 --> 31:46.958
Unfortunately, that was the implication.

31:48.160 --> 31:49.354
I didn't mean that!

31:49.440 --> 31:52.955
Another day and baby would have been
seriously dehydrated.

31:54.280 --> 31:57.272
I'm sorry, Sister,
but you have such influence.

31:58.120 --> 32:00.429
Please take care how you use it.

32:03.160 --> 32:04.991
Johnny
has regained consciousness.

32:06.160 --> 32:08.913
He's been able to talk to the doctors.

32:09.680 --> 32:12.114
But he is very poorly, Mrs Beckett.

32:13.080 --> 32:14.195
He has pneumonia.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.353
Oh...

32:17.680 --> 32:19.636
I didn't know what you
was gonna say then.

32:20.600 --> 32:23.114
Pneumonia.
It's the dust down at the docks.

32:23.400 --> 32:24.719
He just needs a vapour bath.

32:24.960 --> 32:27.269
The chest specialist is treating Johnny,

32:28.000 --> 32:31.629
but he is concerned
there may be some underlying cause.

32:32.920 --> 32:36.515
Your husband mentioned to staff
he'd been exceedingly tired

32:36.800 --> 32:37.800
for a good while.

32:37.880 --> 32:39.598
Well, that will go, won't it?

32:40.040 --> 32:41.155
With the treatment?

32:41.840 --> 32:44.752
The London are going to run
some further tests.

32:45.880 --> 32:47.438
I should like to go to him, Doctor.

32:47.760 --> 32:49.910
If I might suggest you go this evening,

32:50.000 --> 32:52.719
the consultant may have
some of the test results back.

32:53.560 --> 32:57.439
I'll go with you, Mrs Beckett. It will
fit in quite well with my rounds.

33:01.840 --> 33:04.400
Your husband said I could come up.

33:13.440 --> 33:16.352
I tried so hard.
Honestly, I did, Sister.

33:17.480 --> 33:19.277
I wanted to do it like you said.

33:19.720 --> 33:21.233
I wanted to be like my mum.

33:21.880 --> 33:23.199
I wanted to do it right.

33:23.840 --> 33:25.034
But look at me.

33:26.440 --> 33:28.908
He's almost died of thirst 'cause of me.

33:29.280 --> 33:32.158
I put his little life in danger.

33:32.360 --> 33:33.634
No, no.

33:34.360 --> 33:36.874
No, it wasn't you that put him
in danger.

33:38.120 --> 33:39.348
I'm so...

33:40.560 --> 33:42.073
I am so sorry.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.514
I'm not family, I'm just a neighbour.

33:46.640 --> 33:48.278
I sit with her when I can.

33:48.880 --> 33:51.189
Mother, you came!

33:51.560 --> 33:53.391
She don't half get confused.

33:54.040 --> 33:56.349
Old age comes to some
sooner than others.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.353
Mrs Smith.

34:03.120 --> 34:07.750
We have you on our list as a possible
beneficiary of the Home Help service.

34:08.040 --> 34:11.112
- I thought you were going to France.
- No, love.

34:12.040 --> 34:13.438
Does Mrs Smith live alone?

34:13.520 --> 34:15.237
No, she has husband.

34:15.360 --> 34:17.237
Oh, I shall add that to her notes.

34:17.320 --> 34:20.072
He does what he can,
but it's ever such a strain.

34:20.520 --> 34:23.114
I mean, one minute she knows him,
the next she thinks he's

34:23.199 --> 34:25.190
a boy who stole her sweets at school.

34:25.280 --> 34:27.635
Nurse calling.

34:29.360 --> 34:30.839
Oh, hello.

34:31.120 --> 34:33.480
Good afternoon, Nurse Mount,
to what do we owe the pleasure?

34:33.679 --> 34:35.476
You weren't assigned to this visit.

34:35.800 --> 34:37.791
But the yellow pin on the map
says otherwise.

34:38.280 --> 34:41.112
Hmm, well, yellow pin, blue pin...

34:42.679 --> 34:45.672
Mrs Smith seems to be suffering
from senile dementia.

34:45.760 --> 34:47.989
Perhaps you could pop by
the telephone box

34:48.080 --> 34:50.674
and ask Dr Turner to drop in
on his rounds.

34:50.960 --> 34:53.679
I'd like his opinion
so we can see how best to help.

34:54.040 --> 34:55.598
- Of course.
- I'm back.

34:55.719 --> 34:58.632
Oh, you must be Mrs Smith's husband.

34:58.880 --> 35:01.314
Yes, I am.

35:01.400 --> 35:02.799
We're here to assess your wife

35:03.080 --> 35:05.833
with the view to providing home help
for her and for you.

35:06.480 --> 35:08.136
This is my colleague,
Nurse Crane and she...

35:08.160 --> 35:11.072
Nurse Crane and I are,
in fact, acquainted.

35:11.640 --> 35:13.471
We attend Spanish classes together.

35:15.040 --> 35:16.837
That is of no consequence.

35:17.800 --> 35:20.519
Mrs Smith's wellbeing clearly is.

35:20.600 --> 35:23.956
- Please, let me explain.
- No explanation is required, Mr Smith.

35:24.040 --> 35:25.792
Everything is perfectly clear.

35:36.600 --> 35:37.953
Could I buy you a cup of tea?

35:40.120 --> 35:42.554
We have a great deal to do
and no time for tea.

35:45.520 --> 35:47.238
I shan't ask you a thing about it.

35:47.360 --> 35:49.351
But you don't have to pretend
nothing's happened.

35:50.680 --> 35:54.116
We all do that too much of the time
and it's utterly exhausting.

35:57.840 --> 36:00.229
I'm really happy with my life,
Nurse Mount.

36:01.200 --> 36:02.918
It is exactly as I want it.

36:04.080 --> 36:07.072
But, for a moment, perhaps,
I saw something else.

36:08.320 --> 36:11.232
Something I neither expected nor sought.

36:12.240 --> 36:13.639
And I liked it.

36:17.520 --> 36:20.592
It was very kind of you,
the offer of tea.

36:27.080 --> 36:28.957
I wish it weren't him who told me.

36:29.680 --> 36:30.829
The consultant?

36:31.400 --> 36:32.913
What a cold man.

36:33.960 --> 36:38.238
Talking about my Johnny like,
like he was a stranger, not my husband.

36:40.760 --> 36:42.193
What did he call it?

36:43.360 --> 36:44.713
Cancer of the blood?

36:45.400 --> 36:46.435
Leukaemia.

36:47.320 --> 36:49.231
But we've got a baby coming.

36:50.160 --> 36:51.559
You should go to him.

36:52.960 --> 36:56.555
Be with your husband and say
all that you want to say to him.

37:00.040 --> 37:01.519
I'm sorry, Johnny!

37:03.120 --> 37:04.633
I'm sorry!

37:06.280 --> 37:08.077
All those things I said.

37:09.360 --> 37:10.952
Oh, God, Johnny.

37:12.640 --> 37:14.392
I wish I could go back.

37:16.240 --> 37:19.710
Let me go back! Please, let me go back.

37:28.400 --> 37:30.038
You can't leave us.

37:30.560 --> 37:32.073
I love you.

37:33.680 --> 37:35.352
I want my family.

37:44.680 --> 37:46.636
I can't have this baby without him.

37:48.720 --> 37:50.358
You're not going to be alone.

37:50.480 --> 37:53.040
I mean I won't have it without him.

37:54.160 --> 37:57.072
How long until I'm due? A week, two?

37:58.040 --> 38:01.589
About that,
but the dates are never exact.

38:01.680 --> 38:04.638
Johnny's got days to live
and he must see this baby

38:04.760 --> 38:06.432
so I need it to come now.

38:07.320 --> 38:08.594
You can make it come.

38:09.240 --> 38:12.630
We would only induce a mother
if her health was at risk.

38:12.720 --> 38:15.280
My heart is breaking.

38:16.440 --> 38:17.919
Ain't that risk enough?

38:18.920 --> 38:20.956
You promised me you'd get me through.

38:21.880 --> 38:23.199
Well, now I'm asking.

38:24.600 --> 38:26.192
Will you stand by your word?

38:29.320 --> 38:30.320
I will.

38:31.160 --> 38:32.878
I will stand by my word.

39:08.120 --> 39:10.839
I want to ask permission to go away.

39:12.080 --> 39:13.593
For six months, at least.

39:14.320 --> 39:15.799
- To the motherhouse?
- No.

39:15.920 --> 39:18.514
I want to spend time
with an enclosed order.

39:18.840 --> 39:21.070
The Sisters
of the Blessed Infant Christ.

39:21.760 --> 39:25.196
But the Sisters of the Blessed
Infant Christ are very austere.

39:26.440 --> 39:28.078
Silence is kept throughout the day.

39:28.840 --> 39:33.789
I need to be somewhere where the only
being I can speak to is a higher one.

39:34.400 --> 39:36.994
I've got so wrapped up in my work

39:37.120 --> 39:38.792
I've forgotten my calling.

39:39.280 --> 39:40.872
To be a vessel for God.

39:41.080 --> 39:42.479
To do His work.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.912
I've, I've got to start listening again.

39:46.400 --> 39:49.073
Connie tried to tell me
she couldn't breastfeed.

39:49.400 --> 39:50.628
I thought I knew best.

39:50.720 --> 39:52.676
My way or no way.

39:52.760 --> 39:55.194
Well, we both know how I am.

39:56.200 --> 39:59.829
I'm all mouth and He knows that too.

40:00.120 --> 40:02.588
This is not a decision
you can make alone.

40:02.800 --> 40:05.520
At the very least you will need
permission from Mother Jesu Emmanuel.

40:05.760 --> 40:08.718
Please speak to her on my behalf.

40:09.240 --> 40:13.313
I will come back if that's what
He wants, but speak to her.

40:13.400 --> 40:15.197
- Sister...
- Please.

40:19.400 --> 40:20.628
Nurse Crane!

40:21.320 --> 40:22.639
Oh...

40:23.200 --> 40:26.397
A distressed gentleman
wishes to speak with you.

40:26.640 --> 40:27.789
I beg your pardon?

40:27.880 --> 40:29.108
A Mr

40:29.440 --> 40:30.589
Smith.

40:31.520 --> 40:33.829
Oh, erm, tell him I'm not at home.

40:34.160 --> 40:36.151
He awaits you in the front hall.

40:36.400 --> 40:38.311
I don't wish to see him.

40:38.560 --> 40:42.519
And I do not like greens,
yet they are very good for me.

40:54.680 --> 40:57.797
I asked if you were married,
you said you were widowed.

40:57.960 --> 40:59.518
I said I'd lost my wife.

40:59.600 --> 41:01.795
Well, don't stoop to semantics.

41:02.480 --> 41:04.550
For five years
she hasn't known who I am.

41:05.400 --> 41:07.550
No matter what I've tried,
I couldn't reach her.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.433
It was as if she'd died.

41:10.120 --> 41:11.314
As if we both had.

41:12.520 --> 41:15.193
Those classes have been my happiness.

41:16.200 --> 41:20.239
Meeting you, well,
it lifted me, Phyllis.

41:20.960 --> 41:22.951
Gave me something
I thought I'd lost forever.

41:25.560 --> 41:27.198
I'm sorry for your loss.

41:28.160 --> 41:32.472
But the facts are the facts, and we can
escape them no more than your wife can.

41:33.240 --> 41:34.832
I thought we were friends.

41:35.200 --> 41:36.872
Well, I don't need another friend.

41:38.560 --> 41:40.676
You've made a fool out of me, Mr Smith.

41:41.360 --> 41:42.679
Don't come here again.

41:49.480 --> 41:52.631
Mr Beckett has days left. At best.

41:53.160 --> 41:55.116
He will never see his child.

41:55.640 --> 41:57.949
There's no medical reason to induce baby

41:58.080 --> 42:00.230
and Mrs Beckett's blood pressure
is now regulated.

42:00.320 --> 42:02.356
But she has a history of it.

42:02.480 --> 42:03.913
Wouldn't that be reason enough?

42:04.160 --> 42:05.673
No obstetrician would hear of it.

42:06.160 --> 42:08.833
Obstetricians will never be satisfied

42:09.040 --> 42:13.238
until women are entirely absent
from the sacrament of birth.

42:13.920 --> 42:17.629
Dr Turner has always been happy for us
to expedite labour.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.877
When a mother is past her term!

42:19.960 --> 42:21.678
Mrs Beckett must be very close now.

42:21.880 --> 42:23.836
The dates can be a little hazy.

42:24.200 --> 42:25.599
We know our ways work.

42:26.000 --> 42:29.276
Bath, oil and enema
to bring on the contractions.

42:29.960 --> 42:31.234
A man is dying.

42:31.560 --> 42:33.391
We must ask ourselves,

42:33.520 --> 42:37.069
is it right to put Mrs Beckett
through a traumatic procedure

42:37.160 --> 42:40.391
when her husband may pass away
before the baby is delivered?

42:40.880 --> 42:42.279
To give false hope

42:42.400 --> 42:46.188
when perhaps she should use
these last precious hours

42:46.280 --> 42:47.918
to be at his bedside.

42:48.880 --> 42:51.269
You are unusually silent, sister.

42:52.520 --> 42:54.192
What miracle is this?

42:55.000 --> 42:56.991
Forgive me, Sister, but

42:57.400 --> 42:59.755
we don't just deliver babies.

42:59.840 --> 43:01.751
We build families!

43:02.440 --> 43:05.910
Isn't hope for that, however faint,
better than none at all?

43:08.000 --> 43:12.835
If you believe this is what is best for
your patient, then we will support you.

43:14.440 --> 43:15.509
But

43:16.320 --> 43:17.992
it is a great responsibility.

43:18.800 --> 43:22.110
Mr Beckett may pass
before the baby is born.

43:22.920 --> 43:25.150
And I worry about that burden for you.

43:25.800 --> 43:27.119
And it won't be hers alone.

43:28.720 --> 43:29.914
I'll work with her.

43:32.000 --> 43:35.675
I want to try to build this family.

44:18.720 --> 44:20.199
What will I do?

44:23.080 --> 44:24.274
Pray for me?

44:36.840 --> 44:40.719
Stella, we're trying to trick your body
into thinking labour's started.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.992
The castor oil we gave you last night
irritates the bowel.

44:44.440 --> 44:46.237
That can start contractions.

44:46.640 --> 44:48.119
The enema will do the same.

44:48.800 --> 44:51.473
Then, you'll take a hot bath
to help you relax,

44:51.880 --> 44:54.678
the heat intensifies the effects
of the castor oil.

44:54.880 --> 44:56.154
He's not on his own.

44:57.040 --> 44:58.109
Is he?

44:58.440 --> 44:59.873
Dr Turner is with him.

45:01.240 --> 45:03.196
Johnny is waiting for this baby.

45:03.600 --> 45:04.919
And I promise you

45:05.360 --> 45:06.588
he will see it.

45:23.200 --> 45:24.200
Doc...

45:24.640 --> 45:25.675
How much wrong is it?

45:25.760 --> 45:26.875
Not with Stella?

45:27.360 --> 45:28.475
The very opposite.

45:28.760 --> 45:30.637
Your wife is in the maternity home.

45:31.320 --> 45:34.517
And everything's going so well
I'm quite redundant.

45:35.040 --> 45:36.871
I heard you're a Spurs fan.

45:37.280 --> 45:41.068
So I thought I might try to keep you
posted on how the cup goes.

45:41.960 --> 45:43.234
We've run for the double.

45:44.640 --> 45:46.710
Well, you'd better keep
your strength up, Johnny.

45:46.880 --> 45:48.950
We have a long Saturday ahead of us.

45:53.520 --> 45:54.953
It must be coming.

45:56.640 --> 45:57.675
The cramps.

45:57.920 --> 45:59.797
The cramps are from the castor oil.

46:00.520 --> 46:02.397
Your contractions haven't started yet.

46:03.760 --> 46:05.637
Try to relax, Stella.

46:07.080 --> 46:09.753
Dr Turner wonders
if there is any progress.

46:10.360 --> 46:11.998
We're still in the early stages.

46:16.520 --> 46:17.919
We need to hurry things along.

46:20.200 --> 46:21.553
Stretch and sweep.

46:23.960 --> 46:26.520
We're just going to feel
what baby's up to.

46:33.360 --> 46:36.670
We need to do a little more
to bring on contractions.

46:38.440 --> 46:41.000
I'm going to gently stretch your cervix

46:41.320 --> 46:44.153
and then I'm going to ease away
the membranes holding baby.

46:44.760 --> 46:46.352
Oh, God.

46:47.400 --> 46:50.597
The procedure will release a hormone
that will start your contractions.

46:57.640 --> 46:59.392
Now, another deep breath.

47:01.080 --> 47:02.672
Well done!

47:02.840 --> 47:04.717
We're about four fingers dilated.

47:05.200 --> 47:06.315
That's very good.

47:06.920 --> 47:08.638
This should move things along for us.

47:09.040 --> 47:10.473
Another deep breath.

47:13.920 --> 47:16.229
That's it, breathe out.

47:18.440 --> 47:20.510
Think about Johnny meeting his baby.

47:21.680 --> 47:23.193
Think only of that.

47:38.120 --> 47:39.439
My old man

47:41.320 --> 47:43.595
used to take me to the games.

47:45.600 --> 47:47.158
His old man took him.

47:51.280 --> 47:53.748
I got so much

47:54.920 --> 47:56.114
in here.

47:58.440 --> 48:01.034
But my child won't know it.

48:03.640 --> 48:04.993
Come on, Johnny!

48:05.560 --> 48:07.232
Kick-off's nearly here.

48:07.680 --> 48:12.356
You are going to tell your little
son or daughter that Spurs won the cup.

48:12.800 --> 48:14.233
Stay with us.

48:14.960 --> 48:16.712
Your baby is coming.

48:18.200 --> 48:19.394
That's it.

48:19.880 --> 48:21.108
Keep moving.

48:21.280 --> 48:23.032
It's bringing on the contractions.

48:23.600 --> 48:26.592
Come on.
Come on, you've got to see your daddy.

48:29.440 --> 48:30.440
Ooh.

48:33.760 --> 48:37.548
Very soon you're going to be on your way
to the London, with your baby.

48:37.640 --> 48:39.471
Keep going, Stella.

48:44.160 --> 48:46.833
That's it! That's the one!

48:47.680 --> 48:49.113
Baby's coming!

48:49.520 --> 48:52.637
Just breathe.
Breathe through the contractions.

49:00.200 --> 49:01.349
Tell them.

49:02.400 --> 49:03.400
I love her.

49:03.640 --> 49:05.631
You'll tell them yourself

49:06.200 --> 49:08.714
because you're staying with us.
Do you hear me?

49:10.000 --> 49:11.479
I can't protect 'em.

49:12.560 --> 49:13.629
How...

49:18.040 --> 49:19.439
What will happen

49:20.440 --> 49:21.589
to my baby?

49:22.480 --> 49:24.948
Your baby will have an amazing mother.

49:25.720 --> 49:29.110
One who is moving Heaven and Earth
to get to you today.

49:30.120 --> 49:33.032
And you will be here waiting for her.
Do you hear me?

49:43.920 --> 49:45.638
- That's it, keep pushing!
- I can't.

49:45.720 --> 49:47.472
That's it! You can do it.

49:47.880 --> 49:48.949
I've got nothing left.

49:49.040 --> 49:51.395
Stella, Johnny is waiting.

49:51.600 --> 49:53.955
He's waiting for you and your baby.

49:54.240 --> 49:56.754
Now I know you have it,
but you need to find it.

49:56.840 --> 49:58.637
You need to find your fighting spirit

49:58.760 --> 50:00.352
because baby is coming.

50:05.040 --> 50:07.235
That's it, Stella!
One big push, that's it.

50:07.320 --> 50:08.878
Come on, Stella, push!

50:09.440 --> 50:10.953
Yes, that's it, keep going!

50:11.040 --> 50:13.110
Nearly there, nearly there!

50:13.200 --> 50:14.713
Gentle breaths.

50:17.360 --> 50:18.554
That's it!

50:18.960 --> 50:20.029
Head's born.

50:22.680 --> 50:23.874
We have him.

50:26.400 --> 50:28.197
Stella, you have a son.

50:42.360 --> 50:44.351
Johnny, you must hang on!

50:45.040 --> 50:47.600
Whatever strength you have,
hold on, man!

50:49.640 --> 50:51.835
Hello, little one.

50:52.080 --> 50:53.308
That's it.

51:02.080 --> 51:03.479
You came.

51:04.680 --> 51:06.910
You came in time to meet your daddy.

51:11.840 --> 51:14.229
Mrs Beckett, he's wonderful.

51:17.080 --> 51:20.550
I'll have an ambulance standing by,
once you've delivered the placenta.

51:23.400 --> 51:24.628
Thank you.

51:28.800 --> 51:29.915
Johnny.

51:33.480 --> 51:34.708
Here he is, my love.

51:40.760 --> 51:42.318
This is your daddy.

51:44.560 --> 51:45.913
Remember him.

51:47.200 --> 51:49.077
Please. Remember him.

51:51.800 --> 51:53.119
Our son.

51:54.480 --> 51:55.629
John.

51:56.800 --> 51:57.915
John.

52:00.000 --> 52:01.752
Another Beckett at the docks.

52:09.800 --> 52:11.074
I love you both.

52:15.680 --> 52:17.113
I wanna stay.

52:36.320 --> 52:38.788
Ah, Nurse Mount, just the person.

52:40.480 --> 52:42.232
We've good news from the Council.

52:42.720 --> 52:45.518
They are providing twenty home helps.

52:45.680 --> 52:47.193
I should be pushing them for more.

52:47.280 --> 52:48.315
Super!

52:48.720 --> 52:50.278
You deserve the night off.

52:50.840 --> 52:52.592
If we got what we deserved,

52:52.680 --> 52:55.752
I'd be driving the Daimler SP250

52:55.840 --> 52:58.434
with Gene Kelly on hand
to change my tyres.

52:58.520 --> 53:00.192
Well, I can't manage that,

53:00.280 --> 53:02.999
but I can cover the telephone
so you can go to your Spanish class.

53:07.360 --> 53:11.114
I visited Mrs Smith
to arrange for Dr Turner to see her.

53:11.680 --> 53:13.830
I witnessed great care for Mr Smith, but

53:14.640 --> 53:16.710
he could have been anyone
for all she knew him.

53:17.880 --> 53:20.110
He might as well be a widower. Poor man.

53:20.200 --> 53:21.633
But he's not.

53:24.200 --> 53:27.158
I'm sure it takes a terrific strength
to manage as he does at home

53:27.240 --> 53:29.151
and still find a passion for the world.

53:30.080 --> 53:31.308
And it would take

53:31.480 --> 53:34.074
a very long time to build
the trust to share

53:34.160 --> 53:37.152
such a painful and private truth.

53:50.200 --> 53:51.713
<i>Esta occupado?</i>

53:54.360 --> 53:56.271
I said, "Is this seat taken?"

54:01.120 --> 54:02.120
You came!

54:02.320 --> 54:03.958
For the flamenco, that's all.

54:18.440 --> 54:21.637
Poor souls. Falling through the
cracks, but no one there to catch them.

54:21.720 --> 54:23.358
You're there, ain't ya?

54:24.120 --> 54:25.997
I'm just one man, Mrs Beckett.

54:27.360 --> 54:28.554
They need an army.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.275
A good man's an army by himself.

54:43.440 --> 54:44.998
He has your husband's smile.

54:45.320 --> 54:46.799
He does, doesn't he?

54:47.840 --> 54:49.910
I thought I couldn't bear
to be on my own.

54:50.880 --> 54:52.836
Thought that would be
the worst in all this.

54:53.760 --> 54:55.398
But I don't feel alone.

54:56.040 --> 54:57.393
Not with little John.

54:58.360 --> 55:00.749
I'll pick my job up again
when he's older.

55:01.000 --> 55:02.274
We'll manage.

55:05.840 --> 55:06.955
Dear girl.

55:08.840 --> 55:10.671
I'm more sorry than I can say.

55:11.440 --> 55:12.634
He was a fine man.

55:13.800 --> 55:14.835
He was.

55:15.760 --> 55:17.432
And I should have taken greater care.

55:19.080 --> 55:20.718
You made me look to myself, Nurse.

55:21.400 --> 55:22.719
Not before time.

55:24.320 --> 55:27.596
You don't need to listen to my regrets.
So I'll say it how I speak best.

55:29.920 --> 55:31.353
It's not a king's ransom,

55:32.200 --> 55:33.720
but it will see a little prince right.

55:34.760 --> 55:37.274
You put this back where it belongs, eh?

56:01.040 --> 56:02.268
To Johnny.

56:02.560 --> 56:03.879
To Johnny.

56:05.280 --> 56:06.679
To Johnny.

56:08.320 --> 56:09.753
In the future, Barbara,

56:10.200 --> 56:11.519
don't listen to me.

56:12.440 --> 56:14.556
A warrior was just what
the Becketts needed.

56:15.520 --> 56:17.829
You know far more about marriage
than I do.

56:19.920 --> 56:23.879
<i>It was a world
promising all that we could desire,</i>

56:23.960 --> 56:26.030
<i>newer, better, brighter.</i>

56:26.400 --> 56:29.358
<i>We put our faith in the dreams
they sold,</i>

56:29.680 --> 56:34.071
<i>in the machines to save us labour,
clothes to make us more alluring,</i>

56:34.280 --> 56:36.510
<i>furnishings to give us greater comfort</i>

56:37.000 --> 56:41.312
<i>yet the one thing we could not do
without, could never be bought.</i>

56:41.760 --> 56:44.194
<i>No matter how generous the terms.</i>

56:44.560 --> 56:46.198
<i>And it was love.</i>

56:47.520 --> 56:50.478
<i>Love, in all its forms,</i>

56:51.200 --> 56:55.159
<i>precious, fragile and enduring.</i>

56:56.480 --> 57:00.314
<i>The priceless gift
that made our lives worthwhile.</i>

57:01.720 --> 57:03.790
<i>Invisibly upholding us,</i>

57:04.520 --> 57:06.636
<i>demanding no repayment,</i>

57:07.200 --> 57:08.838
<i>offered in silence,</i>

57:09.920 --> 57:12.036
<i>more precious than gold.</i>

57:13.720 --> 57:16.393
I appear to have won a meal
in an Indian restaurant.

57:16.480 --> 57:17.595
Oh, how exotic!

57:17.720 --> 57:18.914
Come with me, then.

57:19.040 --> 57:21.270
I mean, it's not going out, going out.

57:21.360 --> 57:23.669
How do you know it isn't
going out, going out?

57:24.440 --> 57:27.159
Is there any chance at all
that you might be pregnant?

57:28.360 --> 57:29.918
There are things you can do.

57:30.000 --> 57:31.752
Send me to a butcher in a back alley?

57:33.440 --> 57:34.555
What's the matter?

57:35.440 --> 57:37.635
Mrs Monica, would you
go call an ambulance, please?

57:38.080 --> 57:40.036
It's the only time
I've seen those pink spots.

57:40.400 --> 57:41.435
Typhoid.

57:44.500 --> 57:52.500
