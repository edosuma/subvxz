03:12.908 --> 03:15.106
My Bethany,

03:15.108 --> 03:18.066
how could she live
with this guilt?

03:18.068 --> 03:22.267
His facial mutilation
broke her soul

03:22.269 --> 03:27.066
and it wasn't long 'til she
was gone, fled to the woods.

03:27.068 --> 03:29.027
She couldn't take
the pain anymore.

03:36.110 --> 03:37.109
I tried to stop her.

03:39.788 --> 03:42.507
But it was too late.

04:52.033 --> 04:53.110
Do you want me
to call her again?

04:53.112 --> 04:54.791
No.

04:55.713 --> 04:58.711
Kathy what did I
say about phones?

04:58.713 --> 05:00.711
I only brought it
for emergencies.

05:00.713 --> 05:03.392
I have an emergency
phone, put it away.

05:03.394 --> 05:04.673
I'm having that later.

05:06.834 --> 05:08.551
You're taking this phone
thing way too far Wesley.

05:08.553 --> 05:11.152
They increase stress.

05:11.154 --> 05:14.272
They're dirtier than a toilet
seat, they have E. Coli.

05:14.274 --> 05:16.711
No they don't have E. Coli.

05:16.713 --> 05:17.913
They emit radiation
that gives you

05:17.915 --> 05:19.832
headaches and brain tumors.

05:19.834 --> 05:21.712
I mean do you want a
brain tumor Katherine?

05:21.714 --> 05:22.753
- No Wesley.
- Good.

05:25.315 --> 05:28.993
I don't want to hear a beep
or a buzz this whole weekend.

05:28.995 --> 05:31.512
I just want fresh country
air and beautiful scenery

05:31.514 --> 05:33.834
and to be away from
traffic and shops

05:33.836 --> 05:35.194
and fucking television.

05:37.995 --> 05:40.514
And to spend time
with the family.

05:40.516 --> 05:42.514
If they ever show up.

05:42.516 --> 05:44.274
- Mom.
- Oh.

05:44.276 --> 05:46.673
Jessica sweetheart how are you?

05:46.675 --> 05:49.034
- Kurtis hi.
- Hi.

05:49.036 --> 05:51.753
- Hey Wesley.
- You're six minutes late.

05:51.755 --> 05:53.313
Lovely to see this
handsome young chap again.

05:53.315 --> 05:54.433
How are you Kurtis?

05:54.435 --> 05:57.355
I'm very well thanks Kathy.

05:57.357 --> 05:58.954
Oh good gracious do you need
a hand with all that stuff?

05:58.956 --> 06:00.914
Wesley can help.

06:00.916 --> 06:02.954
You do know it's just
one weekend Jessica.

06:02.956 --> 06:04.355
What the bloody hell
have you got in there?

06:04.357 --> 06:06.235
We're fine thanks.

06:06.237 --> 06:08.635
Just chuck it in the back
wherever there's space.

06:08.637 --> 06:10.515
Don't chuck it.

06:10.517 --> 06:13.276
Oh say hello to your brothers.

06:13.278 --> 06:15.274
- Jessie.
- Hey Sam.

06:15.276 --> 06:16.875
Come here.

06:17.557 --> 06:19.315
- Hi Sam.
- Hi.

06:19.317 --> 06:20.396
You remember Kurtis.

06:20.398 --> 06:22.515
Toby say hi to your sister.

06:22.517 --> 06:24.555
- Hi to your sister.
- Hi Toby.

06:24.557 --> 06:27.875
I see you haven't changed dick.

06:27.877 --> 06:29.916
I thought uni might've
made you grow up a bit.

06:29.918 --> 06:31.195
Well it was going great

06:31.197 --> 06:32.755
'til I had to come
back for this shit.

06:32.757 --> 06:35.757
Toby no S word please,
not around your brother.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.476
Toby can Kurtis
maybe sit there?

06:39.478 --> 06:41.557
He doesn't like facing sideways.

06:41.559 --> 06:43.517
- I get carsick.
- I shotgunned it.

06:43.519 --> 06:46.156
I backside it

06:46.158 --> 06:48.877
Well I'd apologize but I'm
not allowed to use the S word.

06:48.879 --> 06:50.716
Everybody
in back there?

06:50.718 --> 06:51.997
- Yeah.
- Yes.

06:51.999 --> 06:53.317
Seat belts on?

06:53.319 --> 06:55.918
No 'cause there aren't any.

06:55.920 --> 06:57.517
I've got snacks in the
shelf above for the journey.

06:57.519 --> 06:59.118
Fruit, water.

06:59.120 --> 07:01.079
- Can we just go?
- Yes Wesley dear.

08:10.043 --> 08:11.081
Toby.

08:13.444 --> 08:14.601
- Toby.
- What?

08:14.603 --> 08:16.721
What you letting him watch?

08:16.723 --> 08:18.200
I'm not letting
him watch anything.

08:18.202 --> 08:19.522
He doesn't have to look.

08:19.524 --> 08:20.682
Well alright what are
you watching then?

08:20.684 --> 08:22.522
Sewage Baby Massacre.

08:22.524 --> 08:24.202
You really think that's
appropriate for a 10 year old?

08:24.204 --> 08:26.562
I've been watching this
stuff since I was like five.

08:26.564 --> 08:30.161
And look how great
your turned out.

08:30.163 --> 08:31.522
Oh freaking hell Sam

08:31.524 --> 08:32.722
it smells like you've had

08:32.724 --> 08:34.522
a Sewage Baby Massacre
in your pants.

08:34.524 --> 08:36.123
Whoever smelt it dealt it.

08:36.125 --> 08:37.802
Seriously though
someone sharted.

08:37.804 --> 08:39.842
Shut up Toby, turn it off.

08:39.844 --> 08:42.243
Sam likes it, he's
learning self defense.

08:42.245 --> 08:44.323
And new swear words.

08:44.325 --> 08:45.483
And how to mash someone's
skull in with a sledge hammer.

08:45.485 --> 08:46.963
No, no more.

08:46.965 --> 08:48.844
- Get off.
- Hey I was watching that.

08:48.846 --> 08:51.123
Toby you can't let
him watch that.

08:51.125 --> 08:53.083
Stop being such a
pussy little bitch.

08:53.085 --> 08:55.843
Toby watch your
language please.

08:55.845 --> 08:57.044
Did you just call
me a little bitch?

08:57.046 --> 08:59.684
Called you a pussy
little bitch.

08:59.686 --> 09:01.523
Please stop using that word.

09:01.525 --> 09:02.443
What bitch?

09:02.445 --> 09:03.723
The P word.

09:03.725 --> 09:06.044
Pussy is not a swear word.

09:06.046 --> 09:06.964
As long as they
referring to you.

09:06.966 --> 09:08.844
- Fuck off.
- Toby that's enough.

09:08.846 --> 09:11.045
I will not have
swearing on this trip.

09:11.047 --> 09:12.964
For heaven's sake
there's no need.

09:12.966 --> 09:14.763
Wesley swears all the time.

09:14.765 --> 09:16.924
Yeah well I'm an adult.

09:16.926 --> 09:18.724
I can do and say what
the fuck I like.

09:18.726 --> 09:21.244
So, I'm 18.

09:21.246 --> 09:25.484
Well then perhaps you
can start behaving like it.

09:25.486 --> 09:28.165
What's pussy?

09:28.846 --> 09:30.645
It's a rude word for a cat.

09:32.447 --> 09:34.245
Hmm I thought it
meant a vagina.

09:38.647 --> 09:40.604
Why did you let them
bring that video thing?

09:40.606 --> 09:42.925
It's a long trip,
they get bored.

09:42.927 --> 09:45.526
Well I'm bored of
hearing them argue over it.

09:45.528 --> 09:47.526
Why can't they just talk?

09:47.528 --> 09:49.247
That's what I did
when I was a kid.

09:49.249 --> 09:50.685
Do you know Sam's gonna end
up turning out like Toby.

09:50.687 --> 09:51.685
Like what?

09:51.687 --> 09:53.526
Socially retarded.

09:53.528 --> 09:57.286
Don't say that
Wesley, you're wrong.

09:57.288 --> 10:00.367
He's just got onto a
very desirable course.

10:00.369 --> 10:02.766
My money's got him onto a
desirable course you mean.

10:02.768 --> 10:04.206
I think we might be lost.

10:04.208 --> 10:05.607
Huh?

10:05.609 --> 10:08.087
This road, it's
not on the map.

10:08.089 --> 10:09.647
Katherine please I
know where we are.

10:09.649 --> 10:11.206
Would it really do any harm

10:11.208 --> 10:13.527
to stop someone and
ask for directions?

10:13.529 --> 10:14.686
We're in the middle
of nowhere Kathy

10:14.688 --> 10:15.967
there's no one to ask.

10:15.969 --> 10:17.967
Do you know what a tom tom is?

10:17.969 --> 10:20.647
It was invented for this reason.

10:20.649 --> 10:21.728
Isn't that what you
and little girls wear

10:21.730 --> 10:22.927
when you're practicing ballet

10:22.929 --> 10:24.007
in front of the bedroom mirror?

10:27.490 --> 10:30.728
I'm sorry, who invited
Cuntis on this trip, anyone?

10:30.730 --> 10:31.688
Toby don't be a shit.

10:31.690 --> 10:32.968
S word!

10:32.970 --> 10:34.929
What did you call me, Cuntis?

10:34.931 --> 10:36.128
Well that's your
name isn't it, Cuntis?

10:36.130 --> 10:37.449
Mom how much further?

10:37.451 --> 10:40.568
I'm not sure love, we're lost.

10:40.570 --> 10:42.608
Oh here, pull over and ask.

10:42.610 --> 10:45.329
Oh no Kathy you never stop

10:45.331 --> 10:47.648
to speak to the creepy old
guy by the side of the road.

10:47.650 --> 10:49.249
Oh I'll talk to him Wesley.

10:49.251 --> 10:50.369
I said no.

10:50.371 --> 10:52.329
Just stop for one second.

10:52.331 --> 10:54.368
Kathy do you want to
be raped and mutilated?

10:54.370 --> 10:55.970
Wesley.

11:01.292 --> 11:02.848
Excuse me hello there.

11:02.850 --> 11:04.249
We're a little lost.

11:04.251 --> 11:06.129
We were wondering if
you could help us?

11:06.131 --> 11:08.170
You want a bit
of my apple cider?

11:10.371 --> 11:12.130
Oh that's kind but no thanks.

11:14.572 --> 11:16.249
We're driving.

11:16.251 --> 11:19.771
I mix it good and tasty mind.

11:19.773 --> 11:22.731
Done it all me self down
here on our farm.

11:25.893 --> 11:27.651
Grow the old apples and all.

11:27.653 --> 11:29.330
Oh that's lovely.

11:29.332 --> 11:31.690
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

11:31.692 --> 11:33.330
I pressed it in a presser.

11:33.332 --> 11:35.212
Boiled 'em up.

11:35.214 --> 11:38.651
I collected the apples
down the river.

11:38.653 --> 11:41.092
We don't want cider,
we're not interested.

11:43.614 --> 11:45.531
We're just looking for the old
Hansen Farm, do you know it?

11:45.533 --> 11:47.572
You ain't here
to drink my cider?

11:49.134 --> 11:50.933
I'm afraid not.

11:52.854 --> 11:55.013
Oh that's alright.

11:55.974 --> 11:58.132
I'll bet you just want lemonade.

11:58.134 --> 11:59.892
You like lemonade.

11:59.894 --> 12:02.052
I've got a little
old lemonade tree

12:02.054 --> 12:05.013
'round the back of them
hay bales where.

12:07.575 --> 12:09.973
Pickled the lemonade
myself didn't I?

12:09.975 --> 12:11.733
Do you make it look and
smell like piss intentionally

12:11.735 --> 12:14.414
or does that happen by accident?

12:14.416 --> 12:16.733
We have a fridge with plenty

12:16.735 --> 12:18.973
of food and drink to
last the whole weekend.

12:18.975 --> 12:21.574
If you could just point us in
the direction of that farm.

12:21.576 --> 12:25.094
The Hansen Farm?

12:25.096 --> 12:27.294
I knows it.

12:27.296 --> 12:29.733
Just down that hill there.

12:29.735 --> 12:32.814
Follow the old ground
and you.

12:35.136 --> 12:36.735
Thank you.

12:52.777 --> 12:55.334
That your family back there?

12:55.336 --> 12:58.575
This is my wife
Kathy and her family.

12:58.577 --> 13:00.736
Is that your little
boy back there?

13:00.738 --> 13:03.094
That's my stepson Sam.

13:03.096 --> 13:04.655
Hi Sammy.

13:06.457 --> 13:09.575
Sure your cute little boy
don't want some of my lemonade?

13:09.577 --> 13:12.017
I can make it for him.

13:12.019 --> 13:14.737
I make it proper
good and tasty like.

13:14.739 --> 13:16.298
Go Wesley, just drive, go.

13:49.941 --> 13:51.540
Oh yes.

13:55.580 --> 13:57.619
Oh smell that fresh country air.

14:00.860 --> 14:02.618
Smells like cow shit.

14:02.620 --> 14:04.417
Oh my ass is numb.

14:04.419 --> 14:06.138
It's hurting my lungs.

14:06.140 --> 14:08.459
Would it have killed you
to just buy some cider?

14:08.461 --> 14:10.299
Right, nobody come 'round
back I'm taking a piss.

14:10.301 --> 14:12.339
He probably only gets
like one customer a day.

14:12.341 --> 14:14.379
Toby there's a toilet inside.

14:14.381 --> 14:16.900
One a week.

14:19.461 --> 14:22.739
It's very pretty here Wesley.

14:22.741 --> 14:25.740
Well at least somebody
appreciates the countryside.

14:29.381 --> 14:32.859
Right ladies your job

14:32.861 --> 14:36.141
is to pitch the tent
right over there

14:36.143 --> 14:38.541
while us men head out and
get some wood for a fire.

14:38.543 --> 14:39.900
Come on Daniels you're
coming with me.

14:39.902 --> 14:41.780
Aren't you gonna
wait for Toby?

14:41.782 --> 14:44.700
I said
us men.

14:51.702 --> 14:54.141
Sam can't you leave
me alone while I piss?

14:59.303 --> 15:00.342
Sam.

15:01.464 --> 15:02.503
Sam.

15:04.222 --> 15:05.061
What are you doing?

15:05.063 --> 15:06.102
Look.

15:06.984 --> 15:08.462
What is that?

15:08.464 --> 15:10.382
Finders keepers.

15:10.384 --> 15:13.022
Oh don't touch old shit,
it could be possessed.

15:13.024 --> 15:14.542
Possessed?

15:14.544 --> 15:16.581
Yeah you know like that
old video I made you watch,

15:16.583 --> 15:18.541
Night of the Satanic Exorcism.

15:18.543 --> 15:20.703
Made you watch it
when you were four.

15:20.705 --> 15:23.782
- Yeah thanks for that.
- You're welcome.

15:23.784 --> 15:26.743
Let's go explore but I
don't want that thing near me.

15:31.184 --> 15:32.223
Okay.

15:36.586 --> 15:38.544
It's good to have you
here with us Jess.

15:38.546 --> 15:40.382
We don't see enough
of you or Kurt.

15:40.384 --> 15:42.463
We just don't
get the time Mom.

15:42.465 --> 15:45.304
That's life, everybody's
money rich and time poor.

15:45.306 --> 15:47.944
Yeah well Kurt and I are
time poor and money poor.

15:47.946 --> 15:49.584
You know we'd help
you if we could Jess.

15:49.586 --> 15:52.944
Oh no Mom that's not
what I was implying.

15:52.946 --> 15:54.184
Since I've stopped
helping you out with money

15:54.186 --> 15:55.544
I barely hear from you.

15:55.546 --> 15:56.704
Is that all you need me for?

15:56.706 --> 15:59.984
Mom don't be so ridiculous.

15:59.986 --> 16:02.545
You know your father and I
met in the city way back when.

16:02.547 --> 16:04.944
Well prices have
gone up since then.

16:04.946 --> 16:06.744
I mean Kurt and I
we barely make rent

16:06.746 --> 16:08.425
and we basically
live in a cellar.

16:08.427 --> 16:11.624
Well it's hard
when you're young

16:11.626 --> 16:15.146
but well it gets a bit easier.

16:15.148 --> 16:18.344
Mom I have been living out
of my overdraft for three years

16:18.346 --> 16:22.305
whereas you have what,
two houses and three cars.

16:22.307 --> 16:23.585
Toby and Sam they're gonna
need to live at home with you

16:23.587 --> 16:25.506
'til they're at least 30.

16:25.508 --> 16:28.146
I don't think Wesley
would like that.

16:28.148 --> 16:30.945
I don't think Wesley
likes much of anything.

16:30.947 --> 16:32.546
He may seem like
a grumpy old man

16:32.548 --> 16:34.506
but actually he's
very kind hearted.

16:34.508 --> 16:37.747
He's done a lot of good for us.

16:37.749 --> 16:39.746
Mom maybe we should just
stay in the motor home.

16:39.748 --> 16:41.746
You can but Wesley
really wants to camp.

16:41.748 --> 16:45.706
That's what we came
all this way for.

16:45.708 --> 16:47.867
Whoa whoa whoa what
the fuck is that?

16:47.869 --> 16:49.387
It's a popup tent.

16:49.389 --> 16:51.027
Where's my tent Kathy?

16:51.029 --> 16:52.347
It's the one I've had
since I was a kid.

16:52.349 --> 16:53.467
It was damp and it was smelly.

16:53.469 --> 16:54.946
Who asked you?

16:54.948 --> 16:57.666
I'm sorry Wesley it
was just really tricky.

16:57.668 --> 16:59.907
This one's so much
easier to put up.

16:59.909 --> 17:02.828
Oh tricky for a useless
old baggage maybe.

17:02.830 --> 17:05.108
Perhaps you should've
left it to the men.

17:13.270 --> 17:15.547
Kind hearted you said?

17:15.549 --> 17:17.147
He just has a
very specific idea

17:17.150 --> 17:18.988
of how he wants
this weekend to be.

17:18.990 --> 17:21.949
Yeah a living hell for us all.

17:21.951 --> 17:24.230
He just wants it to
be perfect, for us.

17:30.471 --> 17:33.068
Oh good fire Wesley.

17:33.070 --> 17:35.910
Oh don't thank me, thank
Mr. Daniels, he got it going

17:35.912 --> 17:37.430
and he gets the
first cut of meat.

17:37.432 --> 17:39.429
Oh no.

17:39.431 --> 17:40.909
Actually Wesley I
don't eat meat.

17:40.911 --> 17:42.788
Oh no you gotta try this.

17:42.790 --> 17:45.150
I cook it rare and bloody.

17:45.152 --> 17:47.509
It'll be the best meat
you've ever tasted.

17:47.511 --> 17:49.949
Better than that dog shit
they sell in the supermarkets.

17:49.951 --> 17:51.749
No this is proper
food, man's food.

17:51.751 --> 17:53.309
We're vegan Wesley.

17:53.311 --> 17:54.990
- What?
- Vegan.

17:56.231 --> 17:58.190
What from Star Trek?

17:58.192 --> 18:00.470
It means vegetarian.

18:00.472 --> 18:03.430
No Mom it means no animal
products, no meat, no dairy.

18:03.432 --> 18:05.430
Well what in the bloody hell
do you expect to eat then?

18:05.432 --> 18:07.351
All kinds of things.

18:07.353 --> 18:10.311
Fruit, vegetables, soy
products, special vegan things.

18:10.313 --> 18:11.990
Isn't that stuff a
bit expensive for you?

18:11.992 --> 18:14.352
Mom it's a choice we've made.

18:14.354 --> 18:15.750
You sure you don't want me
to cook you up some grass?

18:15.752 --> 18:16.950
There's plenty of grass.

18:16.952 --> 18:19.190
Oh how about some leaves?

18:19.192 --> 18:21.231
- Wesley.
- Well that's vegan isn't it?

18:21.233 --> 18:22.592
It's all well and
good making fun of us

18:22.594 --> 18:24.032
but there are benefits
to our vegan diet.

18:24.034 --> 18:26.632
Oh benefits, yeah,
what benefits?

18:26.634 --> 18:28.071
Do you shit flowers?

18:28.073 --> 18:30.751
When you've got
diabetes, heart disease

18:30.753 --> 18:32.952
and a fat belly you
won't be mocking us.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.513
What?

18:37.515 --> 18:39.431
I'm just kidding.

18:39.433 --> 18:41.032
Perhaps you should just
go and get the food bag.

18:41.034 --> 18:43.753
No it's alright
Jess I'll get it.

18:43.755 --> 18:46.632
You two keep the fire going.

18:46.634 --> 18:49.192
It's in the brown
paper bag by the fridge.

18:49.194 --> 18:51.553
Yeah of course it is.

19:26.836 --> 19:28.596
What did I say about phones?

19:29.957 --> 19:32.114
Hey hey that's mine, Mom.

19:32.116 --> 19:35.074
I specifically said
I didn't want phones,

19:35.076 --> 19:37.476
games, computers, all your
electrical shit on this trip.

19:37.478 --> 19:38.796
Give it back.

19:38.798 --> 19:39.755
I didn't come all
the way out here

19:39.757 --> 19:43.074
to have your bullshit
disturbing me.

19:43.076 --> 19:45.355
- You fucking asshole!
- Toby.

19:45.357 --> 19:46.956
You gonna let him
call me an asshole?

19:46.958 --> 19:49.476
An asshole that pays for
you to go to university.

19:49.478 --> 19:51.676
See this is thanks I get.

19:51.678 --> 19:55.276
Do you know what a
spoiled brat you are?

19:55.278 --> 19:58.677
Fuck you, get your
fucking hands off of me.

19:58.679 --> 20:02.636
Toby that's
unacceptable, apologize to Wesley.

20:02.638 --> 20:05.237
No let him go Kathy,
why do you even bother?

20:07.439 --> 20:09.636
Toby.

20:09.638 --> 20:12.317
- Toby, wait, stop.
- Go away Jess.

20:14.079 --> 20:16.356
But we'll find your
phone in the morning.

20:16.358 --> 20:18.197
I'm not sitting
out there with him.

20:18.199 --> 20:21.597
Well great, so you're gonna
leave me out here with him?

20:21.599 --> 20:22.678
You're not gonna convince him

20:22.680 --> 20:24.557
to give you any money you know.

20:24.559 --> 20:25.757
- You're wasting your time.
- What?

20:25.759 --> 20:27.917
Jess give up the act.

20:27.919 --> 20:29.958
I know why you came
back this weekend.

20:29.960 --> 20:32.478
You want money from
Mom and Wesley.

20:32.480 --> 20:34.837
Same reason you
always come back.

20:34.839 --> 20:37.958
- Toby.
- It's fine, I don't care.

20:38.999 --> 20:39.439
What are parents for
other than pissing you off

20:39.441 --> 20:40.918
and giving you money?

20:40.920 --> 20:42.718
You don't know
how lucky you are.

20:42.720 --> 20:45.278
Look maybe I don't
appreciate their money.

20:45.280 --> 20:47.599
Uni is a con and I'm probably

20:47.601 --> 20:49.679
gonna come out with loads of
debt at the end of it anyway.

20:49.681 --> 20:51.919
Look how you're struggling.

20:51.921 --> 20:54.558
Sometimes I don't even know
who I'm doing this degree for.

20:54.560 --> 20:57.038
Me or for them.

20:57.040 --> 20:59.039
Something for Mom to brag
to all her friends about.

20:59.041 --> 21:02.279
You're doing it for
yourself you dumb ass

21:02.281 --> 21:03.600
and you should really
make the most of it

21:03.602 --> 21:05.199
because before you know
it you're gonna be stuck

21:05.201 --> 21:07.920
in the same roundabout of
working and paying bills.

21:07.922 --> 21:10.759
You've got Kurt though.

21:10.761 --> 21:12.880
Had a crush on him since
you were near eight.

21:12.882 --> 21:14.121
I thought you
didn't like Kurt.

21:14.123 --> 21:16.559
No, that's me just
dicking around.

21:16.561 --> 21:18.959
He's a nice guy, I
think he's good for you.

21:18.961 --> 21:23.081
Good, 'cause I
really like him,

21:23.083 --> 21:26.321
Even if it does feel like
you're going down a dead end

21:26.323 --> 21:29.401
at least he's there with you.

21:29.403 --> 21:31.082
Maybe that's what's important.

21:33.363 --> 21:36.721
Look just don't lock
yourself away okay.

21:36.723 --> 21:38.642
Come and join the rest of us.

21:38.644 --> 21:40.801
I'm gonna watch a movie.

21:40.803 --> 21:43.161
Watch too many movies.

21:43.163 --> 21:44.162
Jess.

21:46.644 --> 21:50.042
Don't depend on Mom and Wesley.

21:50.044 --> 21:53.562
I took those university
fees and ran.

21:53.564 --> 21:54.882
Put them at the
back of your mind

21:54.884 --> 21:57.002
and take control of
the life you want.

21:59.884 --> 22:01.963
That's what growing
up is all about.

22:07.964 --> 22:08.963
How?

22:36.727 --> 22:37.766
So, glad you came?

22:39.965 --> 22:41.564
To the middle of nowhere
with your fucked up family?

22:41.566 --> 22:44.164
Hey they're my family.

22:44.166 --> 22:46.005
They're alright really.

22:46.007 --> 22:49.604
I know, I'm joking,
they're bearable.

22:49.606 --> 22:51.125
So are you glad you came?

22:53.487 --> 22:56.326
Of course, I get to
spend the weekend with you.

22:59.208 --> 23:01.926
I hope my mom's
alright out there.

23:01.928 --> 23:03.766
She's got Wesley
to look after her.

23:03.768 --> 23:04.565
To keep her warm in
that sleeping bag.

23:04.567 --> 23:06.006
Oh gross.

23:08.048 --> 23:10.246
Maybe we should've
got a tent too.

23:10.248 --> 23:12.365
No thank you.

23:12.367 --> 23:14.727
We'd have more privacy then.

23:14.729 --> 23:16.688
We could do whatever we wanted.

23:19.968 --> 23:21.767
My brother's right there.

23:21.769 --> 23:23.727
They can't hear.

23:28.688 --> 23:30.286
Kurt.

23:30.288 --> 23:31.327
Kurtis.

23:34.449 --> 23:35.286
Let me play with
your rude cat.

23:37.170 --> 23:38.847
Meow.

23:38.849 --> 23:40.687
I can hear everything
you're doing you know.

23:40.689 --> 23:42.326
It's not okay.

23:42.328 --> 23:45.168
Just put a pillow
over your head Toby.

23:45.170 --> 23:48.089
Fine, but if I throw up
it's going over your bed.

23:51.369 --> 23:53.928
Did you speak to your mom?

23:53.930 --> 23:56.248
Brought it up, but
she wasn't much help.

23:56.250 --> 23:58.168
Why not, you told her
about the flat right?

23:58.170 --> 24:00.048
No I didn't.

24:00.050 --> 24:02.689
Jess what else
are we gonna do?

24:02.691 --> 24:04.367
We've got less than a month.

24:04.369 --> 24:09.169
I know I just didn't know
how to bring it up with them.

24:09.171 --> 24:10.609
Unless you want to
move into Toby's old room

24:10.611 --> 24:12.808
you'll have to find a way.

24:14.652 --> 24:16.169
There's someone
outside in the window.

24:16.171 --> 24:16.969
What?

24:16.971 --> 24:18.649
There was face in the window.

24:18.651 --> 24:20.169
There's no one there now Sam.

24:20.171 --> 24:22.170
Oh Sam it was just a
silly campfire story.

24:22.172 --> 24:24.569
No this was real,
there's someone outside.

24:24.571 --> 24:25.769
Does this have anything to do

24:25.771 --> 24:28.369
with the toy I left on your bed?

24:28.371 --> 24:30.170
It's just a toy Sam.

24:30.172 --> 24:34.170
But that isn't a toy,
it's the creepy cider man.

24:34.172 --> 24:37.371
I guess it is just
us and him out here.

24:37.373 --> 24:39.010
I want to sleep with Mom.

24:39.012 --> 24:40.449
Really you want
to go out there

24:40.451 --> 24:41.769
and let old creepy
face catch you

24:41.771 --> 24:44.611
and turn your blood into cider?

24:44.613 --> 24:46.331
Not helping asshole.

24:46.333 --> 24:47.851
Look Sam let them
be by themselves.

24:47.853 --> 24:49.371
They just want a night
together alone okay?

24:49.373 --> 24:50.770
Yeah you don't want to repeat

24:50.772 --> 24:52.770
the Valentine's day incident.

24:52.772 --> 24:54.930
Remember the nightmares
that gave you?

24:54.932 --> 24:56.811
- Stay with me alright?
- Okay.

24:56.813 --> 24:58.690
But there's
no room Jess.

24:58.692 --> 24:59.691
You can sleep in his bed.

24:59.693 --> 25:01.971
Thank you god.

25:01.973 --> 25:03.173
- We were just...
- Kurtis.

25:04.893 --> 25:05.932
Fine.

26:39.898 --> 26:41.737
- Fucking hell.
- Jesus Christ.

26:44.097 --> 26:45.776
What are you doing
out here Kurt?

26:45.778 --> 26:47.296
Same as you by
the looks of it.

26:47.298 --> 26:49.977
Sneaking a cigarette before bed.

26:49.979 --> 26:52.778
Oh no this is Cozano Corona
cigar, and not a cigarette.

26:57.818 --> 26:59.776
Hey don't tell Katherine,

26:59.778 --> 27:01.978
doctor's told me I had to quit.

27:01.980 --> 27:03.777
I won't tell
anyone if you don't.

27:03.779 --> 27:05.497
Yeah whatever.

27:05.499 --> 27:08.418
Katherine.

27:08.420 --> 27:09.658
Katherine!

27:09.660 --> 27:12.577
What the bloody hell did you do?

27:16.779 --> 27:18.338
Mom, Mom!

27:19.299 --> 27:21.257
No Jess, no, no,
you'll burn, you'll burn.

27:21.259 --> 27:22.899
Get off of me!

27:22.901 --> 27:24.778
Jess wait!

27:24.780 --> 27:26.939
- What is it?
- Stay inside Sam.

27:26.941 --> 27:29.218
What's happened to Mom?

27:29.220 --> 27:31.459
Mom.

27:31.461 --> 27:32.980
- Mom.
- Help me.

27:35.540 --> 27:38.620
Come, come on, up.

27:38.622 --> 27:40.818
Right back to the camper.

27:40.820 --> 27:42.859
Toby get out of the way.

27:42.861 --> 27:43.860
Careful, careful.

27:45.541 --> 27:49.380
What happened?

27:49.382 --> 27:52.699
I don't know, the tent
just went up in flames.

27:52.701 --> 27:54.140
How could the tent
just go up in flames?

27:54.142 --> 27:55.819
I don't know,
Kurt was smoking,

27:55.821 --> 27:57.180
the petrol tank must've
leaked onto the ground.

27:57.182 --> 27:57.979
It was an accident.

27:57.981 --> 27:59.180
This wasn't an accident.

27:59.182 --> 28:00.980
Toby.

28:00.982 --> 28:03.460
Someone out there's
trying to kill us.

28:03.462 --> 28:04.979
Who's got a phone?

28:04.981 --> 28:05.900
We need to call an ambulance.

28:05.902 --> 28:07.300
There's one over here.

28:10.343 --> 28:12.101
Who the fuck's taken my phone?

28:12.103 --> 28:14.500
It was in there specifically
for emergencies.

28:14.502 --> 28:16.062
Toby.

28:16.064 --> 28:17.700
I haven't touched
your fucking phone.

28:17.702 --> 28:18.901
Toby!

28:18.903 --> 28:19.700
Jess somebody's been in here.

28:19.702 --> 28:20.980
Whoever Sam saw in the window,

28:20.982 --> 28:22.341
they've been through our things.

28:22.343 --> 28:23.862
Enough of this bullshit.

28:23.864 --> 28:25.382
We'll drive to the
nearest hospital.

28:25.384 --> 28:27.661
Kurt get the map.

28:27.663 --> 28:30.301
Jess I swear something's
going on out here.

28:30.303 --> 28:32.582
Go, what are you waiting for?

28:32.584 --> 28:33.382
Fucking
thing won't start.

28:33.384 --> 28:35.822
- Just go.
- Right.

28:35.824 --> 28:38.222
Shut your traps you
lot and listen to me.

28:38.224 --> 28:41.382
Jess wrap your mom in a
blanket, keep her warm.

28:41.384 --> 28:43.421
There's a first aid kit
in that box up there.

28:43.423 --> 28:45.503
Put bandages on her burns.

28:45.505 --> 28:47.222
Do the best you can.

28:47.224 --> 28:49.462
Kurt and Toby you're
gonna carry her.

28:49.464 --> 28:50.662
We're gonna go back to
that farm wherever it is.

28:50.664 --> 28:52.182
It's the nearest place.

28:52.184 --> 28:54.783
- But what about...
- We can use their phone.

28:54.785 --> 28:57.382
We'll get an ambulance out here.

28:57.384 --> 28:59.702
Everything will be fine.

29:21.105 --> 29:22.383
Hello?

29:29.986 --> 29:30.985
Hello?

29:32.906 --> 29:34.344
I don't think
anybody's home Wesley.

29:34.346 --> 29:36.584
This place is deserted.

29:36.586 --> 29:38.345
I'll check up ahead.

29:38.347 --> 29:40.305
They must have a phone.

29:54.268 --> 29:55.307
Guys.

29:57.228 --> 29:58.706
Guys!

30:08.189 --> 30:09.188
Hi.

30:11.749 --> 30:14.187
I'm Wesley Wallace,
this is my family.

30:14.189 --> 30:16.027
Stay back Wesley.

30:16.029 --> 30:19.146
We don't want any trouble.

30:19.148 --> 30:20.546
It's just my partner
Kathy here's injured.

30:20.548 --> 30:23.668
We were looking for help.

30:23.670 --> 30:24.507
Thought you might have
a phone we could use.

30:24.509 --> 30:26.269
Help you say?

30:30.348 --> 30:33.468
Yeah, I'm a police officer,
we don't want any trouble.

30:33.470 --> 30:35.587
No trouble officer.

30:35.589 --> 30:37.267
Please can we just leave?

30:37.269 --> 30:40.429
Then you've come
to the wrong farm.

31:00.471 --> 31:02.549
Jess, Kurtis.

31:03.271 --> 31:05.830
Come back, Kurtis come back.

32:14.835 --> 32:16.713
Please don't shoot me.

32:16.715 --> 32:20.353
Silly girl, you'll wish I had.

33:06.797 --> 33:09.915
Leave them
alone, no leave them alone.

33:09.917 --> 33:10.916
Sam.

33:22.397 --> 33:25.917
Please.

33:25.919 --> 33:27.396
Leave them alone,
don't you hurt them.

33:27.398 --> 33:28.397
Sam.

33:29.117 --> 33:30.156
No no.

33:33.118 --> 33:34.997
No.

33:39.799 --> 33:40.798
Hold it Sammy.

33:42.638 --> 33:44.157
I said leave the boy alone.

33:52.519 --> 33:53.719
Cut their hands free.

33:56.839 --> 33:59.759
Don't get any silly ideas
when your hands are free.

34:02.800 --> 34:04.799
The cage doors are electrified.

34:13.561 --> 34:15.159
Keep your hands off the wire.

34:32.041 --> 34:35.040
So do you want to hear a
horror story Mr. Wallace?

34:38.521 --> 34:39.960
Well I have one for you.

34:47.802 --> 34:50.760
It's the story of Hansen Farm.

34:59.643 --> 35:01.202
Like many an intriguing tale

35:03.483 --> 35:05.043
it began with a great tragedy

35:08.523 --> 35:11.322
that saw the untimely death
of my dearly beloved Bethany.

35:15.844 --> 35:18.282
She possessed every
vein of my aching heart

35:21.003 --> 35:24.121
and she took it with
her to the better side.

35:30.003 --> 35:32.882
Naturally the perpetrators
of this deplorable act

35:34.965 --> 35:39.044
had to pay and mercy
found no refuge

35:41.005 --> 35:42.724
in this cold broken heart.

36:08.606 --> 36:12.005
Hansen, you know
you're not welcome here.

36:12.007 --> 36:13.005
What do you want?

36:17.646 --> 36:20.085
Betty, escape on
horseback, and the boys.

36:23.407 --> 36:24.446
No!

36:28.608 --> 36:29.647
Run Caleb run.

36:51.688 --> 36:53.365
- Dad.
- No son no.

36:53.367 --> 36:55.726
Go as fast as your
legs will carry you.

36:55.728 --> 36:57.046
Don't stop until you
reach the village.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.606
Go on run.

36:58.608 --> 37:00.766
- Okay okay.
- Run boy.

37:27.811 --> 37:30.010
This family is doomed
is doomed Betty.

37:33.251 --> 37:36.090
They wrote us a death sentence
in Bethany Hansen's blood

37:39.411 --> 37:42.170
and the more I hate them for it

37:43.610 --> 37:46.730
the less it hurts to witness
this unrelenting torture.

37:48.811 --> 37:50.891
They didn't mean
for this to happen.

37:52.452 --> 37:55.490
You spoke badly of the Hansens.

37:55.492 --> 37:57.050
They wanted to do you proud.

37:57.052 --> 37:59.090
Proud?

37:59.092 --> 38:01.931
The boys who condemn their
own father to this suffering.

38:04.773 --> 38:06.012
Their mother to death.

38:08.331 --> 38:10.770
I have given up on all
but my vengeance.

38:15.373 --> 38:18.132
I will spill as much of
our blood as necessary

38:21.612 --> 38:24.091
for one mere final pleasure

38:26.094 --> 38:31.893
of seeing him, Hansen ruined.

38:51.775 --> 38:53.534
What have you done?

38:55.094 --> 38:56.893
What have you done to my boy?

38:59.574 --> 39:01.452
What have you?

39:13.376 --> 39:15.815
And so your not the
first family to sit

39:19.016 --> 39:21.934
in this terrible prison or
suffer this terrible fate.

39:27.016 --> 39:29.015
The sooner you can except death

39:30.815 --> 39:32.974
the sooner your souls
can find peace.

39:34.817 --> 39:35.735
Bring the boy.

39:47.217 --> 39:48.175
No Sam!

39:49.818 --> 39:52.496
Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam,
Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam.

39:52.498 --> 39:53.416
You're mad.

39:54.536 --> 39:55.495
Sam.

39:57.217 --> 39:59.376
Sam, no.

40:02.217 --> 40:03.257
Sam.

40:08.378 --> 40:09.376
Oh no.

40:11.139 --> 40:13.896
Wesley you must know what
to do in a hostage situation.

40:13.898 --> 40:15.617
Is that what this is?

40:15.619 --> 40:17.416
Well we're being held
hostage aren't we?

40:17.418 --> 40:18.776
What have we done to
provoke these people?

40:18.778 --> 40:21.416
They're just fucking psychos.

40:21.418 --> 40:24.577
Psycho inbred cousin fuckers
from the fucking countryside

40:24.579 --> 40:26.258
that he dragged us to.

40:26.260 --> 40:28.537
Don't blame him, this
isn't anyone's fault.

40:28.539 --> 40:29.776
How does he know who we are?

40:29.778 --> 40:31.057
We could be locked
in here for years.

40:31.059 --> 40:33.498
They want us here
in these cages

40:33.500 --> 40:37.177
to do whatever the fuck it
is they want to do with us.

40:37.179 --> 40:40.938
For the pretty boy
Kurtis and Sam there,

40:40.940 --> 40:42.899
they want them for their faces.

40:44.780 --> 40:47.858
The skin off their faces.

40:47.860 --> 40:49.619
You saw that mask
he was wearing,

40:49.621 --> 40:52.818
well that was some
poor bastard's face.

40:52.820 --> 40:56.019
And while we're stuck
in these cages

40:56.021 --> 40:58.818
there's nothing we can do.

40:58.820 --> 41:00.458
Nothing but sit here and wait.

41:00.460 --> 41:02.258
Wait for what Wesley?

41:02.260 --> 41:05.818
We have to help
Sam, we can't wait!

41:05.820 --> 41:08.818
Katherine will you stop
crying and listen to me?

41:08.820 --> 41:09.619
We're in the middle
of fucking nowhere.

41:09.621 --> 41:11.420
The motor home's broken.

41:11.422 --> 41:14.059
There aren't people or
roads or any fucking thing

41:14.061 --> 41:16.820
for 10, 20 miles
outside of here.

41:16.822 --> 41:18.019
Nothing we can do about it.

41:18.021 --> 41:19.220
There's something I could do,

41:19.222 --> 41:20.780
I could get the fuck
out of this cage.

41:20.782 --> 41:23.420
You heard the man,
the door's electrified.

41:23.422 --> 41:25.780
The only thing you're gonna
do is barbecue yourself.

41:25.782 --> 41:26.581
Isn't that what they're
gonna do to us anyway?

41:26.583 --> 41:28.021
Enough!

41:28.023 --> 41:29.501
Enough.

41:29.503 --> 41:31.019
Nobody is dying today.

41:31.021 --> 41:32.940
I'm not staying in this cage.

41:32.942 --> 41:34.621
We have to escape or die trying.

41:34.623 --> 41:36.061
One deranged farmer

41:36.063 --> 41:38.621
is not gonna take down
an entire family.

41:38.623 --> 41:40.782
Okay we have got to stop arguing

41:40.784 --> 41:42.220
and we'll get out of here alive.

41:42.222 --> 41:43.581
Fuck this!

41:54.382 --> 41:55.581
Kurtis.

41:57.824 --> 41:59.383
Don't leave us here, Kurtis.

42:00.623 --> 42:02.061
Kurt!

42:02.063 --> 42:05.023
Come let us out.

42:35.025 --> 42:36.304
No.

44:03.429 --> 44:04.829
Bethany.

44:13.070 --> 44:14.909
I've missed you.

44:16.831 --> 44:18.347
I can't stop myself
from thinking

44:18.349 --> 44:21.829
about the years you were here.

44:21.831 --> 44:24.829
Like some lost dream you
forget just as you awaken.

44:29.871 --> 44:31.750
But I awoke far too soon Beth.

44:34.072 --> 44:36.151
I wasn't done dreaming with you.

44:39.032 --> 44:41.151
The memories don't
feel real anymore.

44:43.952 --> 44:45.991
We had so much more
I wanted to do.

44:48.791 --> 44:50.831
Every day I grow
older without you.

44:54.152 --> 44:54.990
Breaks my heart.

45:01.072 --> 45:03.711
Me and Sammy we gotta
get out of this place.

45:06.753 --> 45:10.391
The killing and the
torment pulls me further

45:10.393 --> 45:13.112
and further away from
everything we ever had.

45:15.273 --> 45:18.351
I have to leave this
nightmare behind Bethany

45:18.353 --> 45:19.831
and begin again.

45:27.875 --> 45:29.233
But I promise you this,

45:33.153 --> 45:35.992
I will never stop wishing
we could just go back.

46:26.436 --> 46:28.396
About fucking time.

46:43.677 --> 46:45.237
Mom, Mom.

46:47.717 --> 46:49.597
What happened?

46:49.599 --> 46:50.876
Where's Wesley?

46:50.878 --> 46:52.237
They let him out.

46:52.239 --> 46:53.796
Oh God what are
they gonna do to him?

46:53.798 --> 46:56.075
Where's Wesley?

46:56.077 --> 46:57.637
Nothing Mom.

46:57.639 --> 46:58.876
Don't you get it?

46:58.878 --> 46:59.918
They let him out.

47:01.798 --> 47:03.436
I think he set this
whole thing up.

47:03.438 --> 47:06.117
Toby I know you don't like him

47:06.119 --> 47:08.038
but he would never
do that to us.

47:10.079 --> 47:11.637
Then where the
fuck is he then Mom?

47:11.639 --> 47:13.398
I don't know.

47:15.440 --> 47:18.436
But it can't be what you're
thinking it just can't be.

47:18.438 --> 47:20.038
Why not?

47:20.920 --> 47:23.637
It was his idea to bring
us here in the first place.

47:23.639 --> 47:25.758
He got rid of all our phones,
all ways of communication.

47:25.760 --> 47:28.079
He just wanted peace
and quiet Toby.

47:28.081 --> 47:30.918
He wanted to make sure that
we couldn't call for help.

47:30.920 --> 47:32.398
He's fucking in on it.

47:32.400 --> 47:34.918
He's got some kind of deal.

47:34.920 --> 47:37.758
Look I know we're all
scared and we're all hurting

47:37.760 --> 47:40.719
but these accusations
are just paranoia.

47:40.721 --> 47:42.200
It'll only make things worse.

47:42.202 --> 47:44.159
It's not paranoia!

47:44.161 --> 47:45.479
I watched him fucking
dart out of here.

47:45.481 --> 47:47.080
Enough!

47:48.641 --> 47:49.840
It makes sense Mom.

47:51.722 --> 47:54.119
For once can you
just listen to Toby?

47:54.121 --> 47:56.960
I can't believe I'm hearing
this from my own children.

47:59.041 --> 48:01.960
I swear if you're right
then Wesley's a dead man.

48:04.402 --> 48:08.039
You don't know him like I do.

48:08.041 --> 48:11.240
Haven't spent those long summer
evenings drinking fine wine

48:11.242 --> 48:12.681
at Chateau La Villatade.

48:15.563 --> 48:17.400
You didn't catch him watching
you from across the bar

48:17.402 --> 48:20.641
on Seven Seas Mariner.

48:23.762 --> 48:26.241
He smiled and well with
that look in his eye

48:28.403 --> 48:30.842
as he took my hand in his.

48:34.123 --> 48:37.921
He's tried to do his
very best by this family.

48:37.923 --> 48:39.441
When your dad could do nothing

48:39.443 --> 48:41.202
but run away from our problems.

48:44.043 --> 48:45.922
Funded an education
for you Toby.

48:47.844 --> 48:49.481
The way I even
have to defend him

48:49.483 --> 48:51.443
is like a stab in my heart.

48:51.445 --> 48:53.282
Then where is he now then Mom?

48:53.284 --> 48:55.203
Wherever he is I,

48:55.923 --> 48:58.402
I hope to god he's alright.

48:58.965 --> 49:01.563
I just wish you'd feel the same.

49:08.164 --> 49:11.762
Nice to see you
again Mr. Wallace.

49:15.005 --> 49:17.724
I am not part of that
family you dumb fuck.

49:22.606 --> 49:24.844
You branded me, you shot me

49:24.846 --> 49:26.764
with salt shit you
fucking prick.

49:29.646 --> 49:31.405
And as for you,
you ugly spastic.

49:38.447 --> 49:40.925
Now now Mr. Wallace
that's quite enough.

49:43.766 --> 49:46.405
Hey who the fuck are
you supposed to be?

49:46.407 --> 49:50.206
If you'd care to calm
down and contain your temper

49:50.208 --> 49:52.126
than I am the
Reverend Hawksworthe

49:53.847 --> 49:57.246
and I have your payment.

49:57.807 --> 50:01.086
My arrangement was the
meat eater, where is he?

50:01.088 --> 50:03.726
Well the meat eater
does not set foot

50:03.728 --> 50:06.566
on Hansen Farm under
any circumstance.

50:06.568 --> 50:09.445
Therefore he has sent me

50:09.447 --> 50:12.206
to perform this most
delicate of transactions.

50:14.048 --> 50:16.046
And who exactly
are you Reverend?

50:16.048 --> 50:20.045
A loyal and dedicated
customer you might say.

50:20.047 --> 50:23.007
One with first orders
on the new batch

50:23.009 --> 50:26.526
that we are paying you
ever so handsomely for.

50:26.528 --> 50:28.807
Well you tell the meat eater

50:28.809 --> 50:31.007
the deal was to bring
the kids to the farm.

50:31.009 --> 50:32.847
It was not to be
locked in a cage,

50:32.849 --> 50:36.048
shot with rock salt and
branded like cattle.

50:36.050 --> 50:37.648
I'm gonna look a
right fucking wally

50:37.650 --> 50:40.128
with my shirt off on the beach.

50:40.130 --> 50:42.008
Even in Benidorm I couldn't
get away with that.

50:42.010 --> 50:44.568
Well I'll, I'll pass
on the complaint.

50:44.570 --> 50:45.927
I want double.

50:45.929 --> 50:47.807
I want double what
he's paying me.

50:47.809 --> 50:50.248
Better the poor who
walks in his integrity

50:52.891 --> 50:55.210
than he who is crooked
though he be rich.

51:00.010 --> 51:02.488
It's in the Bible Mr. Wallace.

51:02.490 --> 51:04.289
Well you can shove your Bible

51:04.291 --> 51:06.930
up your faggot ass
sideways you silly prick.

51:11.130 --> 51:13.969
The meat eater believes
that a deal is a deal.

51:17.251 --> 51:19.648
Yeah?

51:19.650 --> 51:22.769
Well these aren't sweaty curry
eating greasy faced Pakis

51:22.771 --> 51:25.249
and big nosed monkeys
off the street corner.

51:25.251 --> 51:28.130
I brought you a clean
middle class white family.

51:28.132 --> 51:29.450
This is gourmet flesh
compared with the shit

51:29.452 --> 51:31.889
you've been keeping in there.

51:31.891 --> 51:34.769
Bloody council estate
chippos and homeless scum.

51:34.771 --> 51:37.010
You'll get your money.

51:37.012 --> 51:40.291
Oh I know I'll get my money,
every last fucking penny

51:40.293 --> 51:43.052
and I want it now so I can the
fuck out of this shit hole.

51:53.054 --> 51:54.052
Oh.

51:55.853 --> 51:58.092
Well well, maybe
you're right Reverend,

52:00.693 --> 52:03.651
maybe I should read
the Bible more often.

52:03.653 --> 52:06.373
Well here's to a
happy retirement.

52:06.375 --> 52:08.452
Sunny skies in Hawaii

52:08.454 --> 52:12.132
and sipping Pina Coladas
on Harpooner Beach.

52:12.134 --> 52:14.853
Reverend fuck you very
much, enjoy the flesh.

52:30.536 --> 52:32.815
Dumb fucking assholes.

52:47.655 --> 52:49.374
Let me go you fucking freak

52:49.376 --> 52:50.815
or I'll rip your ugly head off.

52:53.016 --> 52:55.975
No no, we had a deal you
asshole, we had a deal.

52:57.496 --> 52:59.775
Let me out of here.

52:59.777 --> 53:02.255
Let me go, I want my money.

53:03.496 --> 53:05.816
It's mine you thieving prick.

53:05.818 --> 53:06.817
Give me my money!

53:15.858 --> 53:18.615
I fucking
told you it was him.

53:18.617 --> 53:20.657
Kathy, listen.

53:23.577 --> 53:25.416
You know when you're
with the people

53:25.418 --> 53:26.615
that you're supposed to love

53:26.617 --> 53:28.416
and well they're
driving you so mad

53:28.418 --> 53:30.776
that you wish something bad
would happen to them all

53:30.778 --> 53:33.295
or you wouldn't care
if it did happen

53:33.297 --> 53:36.976
or they're pissing you
off, they deserve it right?

53:36.978 --> 53:39.577
But as soon as you're away,

53:39.579 --> 53:40.776
even for a moment you think
differently about them,

53:40.778 --> 53:44.057
you realize how much you care.

53:44.059 --> 53:47.456
Well I had that with my sister.

53:47.458 --> 53:51.137
Well growing up it was
always shouting and arguing.

53:51.139 --> 53:53.378
I'd think why don't
you just fuck off.

53:53.380 --> 53:55.659
I don't care if you
get hit by a bus.

53:59.019 --> 54:01.858
And as soon as something
bad happened,

54:01.860 --> 54:04.858
say her and Dad had an argument,

54:04.860 --> 54:06.858
he was a miserable
git his old life,

54:09.579 --> 54:12.418
you guess how much Kathy,
you care and you worry

54:17.181 --> 54:20.057
and I don't know how or why
this feeling is so extreme

54:20.059 --> 54:22.978
because really you just
care about your family.

54:25.380 --> 54:28.940
It's no good you
saying all this now,

54:28.942 --> 54:31.860
now that you're back in
here with us you dumb cunt.

54:35.581 --> 54:38.820
Maybe if I were to survive
this despicable situation

54:38.822 --> 54:41.780
you put my family into I
would feel like I care,

54:44.342 --> 54:46.141
but probably not.

54:47.262 --> 54:51.260
Right now I only feel
that extreme feeling

54:51.262 --> 54:52.261
you're talking about.

54:54.302 --> 54:57.059
I would see the skin
torn off your bones

54:57.061 --> 54:59.740
and have your rolled in salt.

54:59.742 --> 55:02.740
Katherine please.

55:02.742 --> 55:05.021
And if I ever get out
of this cage Wesley

55:07.382 --> 55:10.181
I swear to God I'll kill you
with my bare fucking hands.

55:14.864 --> 55:19.302
Do you understand me?

55:20.103 --> 55:23.461
I tried to give you
a quick death Kathy.

55:23.463 --> 55:26.981
I made my tent damp with
petrol before we came away.

55:26.983 --> 55:31.063
Should've been all over
in a few blazing moments.

55:31.065 --> 55:34.302
Do you understand
what you have done

55:34.304 --> 55:36.782
to my family you sick
little man, do you?

55:39.664 --> 55:41.264
Yes I do.

55:43.583 --> 55:45.422
I have sold your
flesh by the pound

55:48.105 --> 55:51.142
to farmer Hansen and his
very wealthy customers.

55:55.146 --> 55:58.862
They have paid me very
handsomely to bring you here

55:58.864 --> 56:02.224
and now, now they
are going to eat

56:02.226 --> 56:05.025
every digestible inch of you
and your ungrateful brat kids.

56:08.786 --> 56:11.863
Then thank God for
the small comfort

56:11.865 --> 56:14.144
of knowing that you're
getting eaten too.

56:17.746 --> 56:19.346
Don't, don't.

56:20.666 --> 56:22.545
Toby don't.

56:24.586 --> 56:25.585
Don't!

56:27.947 --> 56:30.266
Toby!

56:35.467 --> 56:36.465
No!

56:40.467 --> 56:41.786
No.

57:26.630 --> 57:28.387
Toby.

57:28.389 --> 57:31.748
No, no Toby no, no, no.

57:33.670 --> 57:35.028
Toby, Toby listen to me.

57:35.030 --> 57:36.068
This might be the only chance

57:36.070 --> 57:37.668
you get to get out
of this place.

57:37.670 --> 57:40.829
Listen you know what
you've got to do.

57:40.831 --> 57:42.869
- Jess no.
- Mom shut up listen.

57:42.871 --> 57:45.430
Any place is better than
being stuck in here.

57:49.871 --> 57:51.668
Don't do it.

57:51.670 --> 57:53.269
Please no.

57:55.192 --> 57:56.628
No.

57:56.630 --> 57:58.229
No.

58:01.592 --> 58:03.869
Toby, Toby no.

58:12.072 --> 58:13.429
No, no.

01:01:00.561 --> 01:01:02.519
Sammy!

01:01:08.641 --> 01:01:10.720
Come on, come on.

01:01:11.601 --> 01:01:12.640
Come on.

01:01:15.081 --> 01:01:16.800
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.

01:01:18.681 --> 01:01:20.358
Come on you.

01:01:57.362 --> 01:01:59.321
Sleep well my son.

01:02:00.724 --> 01:02:02.242
This will all be over soon.

01:02:04.083 --> 01:02:07.242
We're gonna get
out of this hell.

01:02:07.244 --> 01:02:09.803
You and me, we're gonna
get a fresh start.

01:02:12.324 --> 01:02:15.722
We have your mother's
blessing now.

01:02:15.724 --> 01:02:17.403
Tomorrow we leave Hansen Farm.

01:02:18.885 --> 01:02:21.401
Sleep well my son.

01:02:58.606 --> 01:03:00.205
Mom Mom.

01:03:00.847 --> 01:03:02.244
You have a bowl right?

01:03:02.246 --> 01:03:03.885
- What?
- A bowl, a bowl Mom.

01:03:06.206 --> 01:03:08.365
Yes I have.

01:03:08.367 --> 01:03:10.325
Okay listen to me.

01:03:10.327 --> 01:03:12.246
We need his blood.

01:03:14.286 --> 01:03:15.245
Oh, Jess, I can't.

01:03:22.967 --> 01:03:24.445
Jess, Jess I can't, oh no.

01:03:32.568 --> 01:03:35.287
You can do this.

01:03:39.168 --> 01:03:40.887
- Oh god, oh.
- Listen, listen.

01:03:46.809 --> 01:03:47.888
Oh Jess I can't.

01:04:01.090 --> 01:04:02.608
No.

01:04:19.371 --> 01:04:21.210
- Oh my god.
- Come on.

01:04:23.570 --> 01:04:24.369
One.

01:04:29.771 --> 01:04:31.330
Two, ready?

01:04:32.012 --> 01:04:33.010
Three.

01:04:33.931 --> 01:04:36.289
Mom that's great.

01:04:36.291 --> 01:04:38.008
Come on you fucking.

01:04:53.853 --> 01:04:55.771
Trust me Mom.

01:05:16.293 --> 01:05:17.691
Okay.

01:05:55.056 --> 01:05:56.095
Jess.

01:05:59.375 --> 01:06:00.733
Jess.

01:06:31.697 --> 01:06:35.817
Jess, Jess get the
keys, get the keys.

01:06:36.416 --> 01:06:38.096
Shit.

01:06:40.978 --> 01:06:44.414
He'll kill us both if
he finds him dead here.

01:06:44.416 --> 01:06:45.375
Hide, hide the body.

01:06:49.617 --> 01:06:53.575
Come on.

01:06:53.577 --> 01:06:54.617
Come on.

01:06:56.338 --> 01:06:57.577
Okay, okay.

01:07:03.099 --> 01:07:04.376
Sammy!

01:07:04.378 --> 01:07:05.776
You have to hurry Jess.

01:07:05.778 --> 01:07:08.296
- Sammy!
- You have to hurry.

01:07:12.898 --> 01:07:14.896
Cook you fucker.

01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:21.537
Mom, Mom hold tight.

01:07:21.539 --> 01:07:24.177
I'm getting you out of there.

01:07:24.179 --> 01:07:26.258
I'm getting you out.

01:07:28.019 --> 01:07:29.059
Come on.

01:07:31.139 --> 01:07:32.898
Why won't you fucking start?

01:07:35.139 --> 01:07:37.458
Sammy open up!

01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:39.458
Don't make me ask twice, Sammy.

01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:42.579
Hide.

01:07:42.581 --> 01:07:44.180
Hide Jess.

01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:50.099
Hurry.

01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:56.380
Oh no.

01:08:11.621 --> 01:08:12.701
Where's the girl?

01:08:13.822 --> 01:08:15.900
Where's the boy?

01:08:15.902 --> 01:08:18.781
He took them, that
monster took my children.

01:08:18.783 --> 01:08:19.862
Sammy took them?

01:08:23.421 --> 01:08:24.740
Can you smell 'em Bill?

01:08:28.221 --> 01:08:30.261
How do I know they
didn't break out?

01:08:33.023 --> 01:08:35.902
How do I know they're not
hiding in here right now.

01:09:12.185 --> 01:09:15.062
That little rascal,
I'll kill him.

01:09:15.064 --> 01:09:16.423
Bill take these
out to the truck.

01:09:16.425 --> 01:09:17.783
I've gotta find my boy.

01:09:20.506 --> 01:09:22.024
That's all I got for today.

01:09:24.904 --> 01:09:26.385
I ain't finished with her.

01:09:50.827 --> 01:09:53.504
Sammy you little devil.

01:09:53.506 --> 01:09:54.705
What have I told you?

01:10:43.710 --> 01:10:46.507
Where's your fucking children?

01:10:46.509 --> 01:10:47.348
They're gone.

01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:49.027
Where?

01:10:49.029 --> 01:10:51.628
They outsmarted you
and your retarded son.

01:10:51.630 --> 01:10:54.269
They didn't outsmart my son.

01:10:54.990 --> 01:10:56.109
They murdered him.

01:10:57.710 --> 01:10:59.109
They slaughtered my boy.

01:11:01.470 --> 01:11:04.309
And they'll slaughter you
too if they get the chance.

01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:10.349
You're right.

01:11:12.871 --> 01:11:14.989
I've been doing this
for far too long.

01:11:19.112 --> 01:11:21.711
Little Sammy this world
was cruel to him

01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:25.109
and it was cruelty he clang to.

01:11:26.671 --> 01:11:28.710
It's all the poor boy ever knew.

01:11:32.912 --> 01:11:35.871
It hurts, but I know he
deserves to lie dead in his bed

01:11:40.672 --> 01:11:41.830
but that's the
punishment I've brought

01:11:41.832 --> 01:11:43.271
upon this broken family.

01:11:45.431 --> 01:11:47.911
Let us go and we'll
leave you in peace.

01:11:51.912 --> 01:11:54.311
But until you do this
farm is going to hell.

01:11:56.873 --> 01:11:59.752
10 years back Ms. Harver
I could've let you go,

01:12:03.274 --> 01:12:06.193
but I've had plans to leave
this place for so long.

01:12:08.833 --> 01:12:11.831
A fresh start for me and my son

01:12:11.833 --> 01:12:14.991
and your family was
my ticket to get out.

01:12:14.993 --> 01:12:17.032
I know the pain I've caused you.

01:12:20.755 --> 01:12:23.793
I've carried that ache in my
heart and my mind for years.

01:12:27.715 --> 01:12:32.433
You'll be the end of me if
I hadn't locked that cage.

01:12:32.435 --> 01:12:35.234
There's only ever been one
lucky man to escape this farm.

01:12:38.314 --> 01:12:40.233
Everett Blackheart.

01:12:44.555 --> 01:12:46.554
Betty baby.

01:12:51.475 --> 01:12:53.554
Betty baby.

01:12:55.716 --> 01:12:57.315
There she is.

01:12:58.595 --> 01:13:01.193
Bet you're hungry Betty.

01:13:01.195 --> 01:13:03.754
Ain't your fault your
husband let your boys do

01:13:03.756 --> 01:13:05.275
what he let them do.

01:13:06.516 --> 01:13:08.115
Bet you don't have much say,

01:13:09.996 --> 01:13:12.594
but now you pay the
price for what they did,

01:13:12.596 --> 01:13:14.835
ain't fair is it?

01:13:14.837 --> 01:13:17.795
But that's just life Betty.

01:13:17.797 --> 01:13:20.995
Life made you an ugly hog.

01:13:20.997 --> 01:13:25.356
Same way life made my
Bethany such a beauty

01:13:25.557 --> 01:13:28.396
and then took her from me in
its cruel and merciless way.

01:13:34.318 --> 01:13:36.356
Got something for you.

01:13:38.118 --> 01:13:39.757
Here.

01:13:40.719 --> 01:13:42.358
Go on.

01:13:43.238 --> 01:13:44.917
Help yourself.

01:13:46.118 --> 01:13:49.836
You can get it.

01:13:49.838 --> 01:13:51.836
Good girl.

01:14:00.878 --> 01:14:02.717
You let her go, you bastard!

01:15:21.203 --> 01:15:23.922
You know I've thought
about this Betty, boys.

01:15:30.323 --> 01:15:33.402
On how I might escape.

01:15:35.524 --> 01:15:40.722
Sometimes what we do in
love is a painful sacrifice.

01:15:43.005 --> 01:15:44.723
My men are for sure on their

01:15:44.725 --> 01:15:46.923
hard treacherous
journey of survival.

01:15:49.204 --> 01:15:51.724
Everett you'll have
to cut off your feet

01:15:54.125 --> 01:15:56.243
and find the keys,
it's the only way.

01:15:58.524 --> 01:16:01.763
I've thought that love.

01:16:01.765 --> 01:16:04.244
But I'm already missing
several toes you see

01:16:06.765 --> 01:16:08.924
and I cannot afford
to spare more flesh

01:16:10.725 --> 01:16:14.284
off my miserable frail body.

01:16:14.886 --> 01:16:17.885
Sometimes a clean harmless
solution cannot be met.

01:16:20.287 --> 01:16:23.763
But that man isn't taking
another drop of blood from me.

01:16:23.765 --> 01:16:26.884
You have to save our boys.

01:16:26.886 --> 01:16:29.485
These troublesome beasts
are no sons of mine!

01:17:01.568 --> 01:17:03.167
Help us.

01:17:08.929 --> 01:17:11.847
Please don't hurt my family.

01:17:11.849 --> 01:17:13.887
They killed my son Ms. Harver.

01:17:15.448 --> 01:17:17.927
Now I take what's my mine.

01:17:19.729 --> 01:17:21.128
You leave my Sam alone.

01:17:24.048 --> 01:17:27.567
He's not your Sam any more.

01:17:27.569 --> 01:17:31.128
You let him go, you bring
him back to me you bastard!

01:18:13.332 --> 01:18:14.929
Okay.

01:19:10.974 --> 01:19:12.813
Please you have to help me.

01:19:13.975 --> 01:19:16.333
Oh my goodness.

01:19:16.335 --> 01:19:18.652
Please
help my family.

01:19:18.654 --> 01:19:20.333
Terry call for an ambulance.

01:19:25.135 --> 01:19:27.293
You poor thing were
you in an accident?

01:19:29.336 --> 01:19:31.374
I don't
know it's the farmer,

01:19:31.376 --> 01:19:34.095
he's killing people and
they're eating them.

01:19:36.015 --> 01:19:37.494
You need to call the police.

01:19:37.496 --> 01:19:39.095
We will.

01:19:40.296 --> 01:19:43.735
But I'm sure this is just
a big big misunderstanding.

01:19:43.737 --> 01:19:45.094
Some of the local farmers

01:19:45.096 --> 01:19:48.733
they like to play silly
tricks that's all.

01:19:48.735 --> 01:19:50.894
It's not a trick,
they're fucking cannibals.

01:19:50.896 --> 01:19:53.456
Let me get you some water.

01:19:54.417 --> 01:19:56.496
Come here, let me
get you some water.

01:19:58.737 --> 01:20:00.336
Calm down.

01:20:02.537 --> 01:20:04.736
It'll help calm you down dear.

01:20:29.338 --> 01:20:30.937
Here drink this.

01:20:30.939 --> 01:20:33.257
I'm not thirsty.

01:20:33.259 --> 01:20:34.817
You really should
drink something.

01:20:34.819 --> 01:20:36.057
I really just want
to go to the bathroom

01:20:36.059 --> 01:20:38.217
and get this blood off of me.

01:20:38.219 --> 01:20:40.978
Fine, I'll take
you up to the shower.

01:20:43.180 --> 01:20:44.899
Come on.

01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:55.298
Towel's over there,
don't use the white one.

01:20:55.300 --> 01:20:59.138
We'll be just downstairs
when you're done.

01:22:13.384 --> 01:22:15.461
Don't fucking move or I'll
rip this bitch's throat.

01:22:15.463 --> 01:22:18.382
Do what she says.

01:22:18.384 --> 01:22:21.062
You didn't call the police
did you you fucking bitch.

01:22:21.064 --> 01:22:23.621
Let my wife go, this is...

01:22:23.623 --> 01:22:25.142
Who did you call?

01:22:25.144 --> 01:22:26.182
Just fucking tell her Terry,

01:22:26.184 --> 01:22:29.543
she's going to die either way.

01:22:29.545 --> 01:22:32.344
We have a very particular
taste for a particular delicacy.

01:22:35.305 --> 01:22:38.104
The supplier, who goes
by the name meat eater,

01:22:41.064 --> 01:22:44.744
we were instructed to call
him in case of an emergency.

01:22:44.746 --> 01:22:46.782
So we called him.

01:22:46.784 --> 01:22:48.742
The meat eater,
he's coming here?

01:22:48.744 --> 01:22:51.664
He's on his way.

01:22:51.666 --> 01:22:54.505
Call him, tell him to open
the door and let himself in.

01:22:56.586 --> 01:22:57.945
He'll kill us all.

01:22:57.947 --> 01:22:59.263
I'm gonna rip her
fucking head off.

01:22:59.265 --> 01:23:02.263
Just fucking call
him Terry, call him!

01:23:02.265 --> 01:23:03.304
Now.

01:23:11.826 --> 01:23:12.745
Mom.

01:23:12.747 --> 01:23:14.224
Oh god.

01:23:14.226 --> 01:23:15.825
Mom.

01:23:15.827 --> 01:23:19.745
Oh no, oh god no Toby
that's not you in there.

01:23:19.747 --> 01:23:21.066
Please.

01:23:21.068 --> 01:23:23.665
Oh god that's
not you in there.

01:23:23.667 --> 01:23:24.466
Please help me.

01:23:27.067 --> 01:23:29.026
You have to get me out of here.

01:23:29.028 --> 01:23:29.987
- I can't.
- Please.

01:23:31.747 --> 01:23:34.705
I can't get you out Toby.

01:23:34.707 --> 01:23:37.545
Please Mom, please.

01:23:37.547 --> 01:23:40.346
If I could open the door and
say I'm sorry and hold you.

01:23:43.548 --> 01:23:45.068
I can't watch you die Toby.

01:23:46.988 --> 01:23:48.267
I can't watch you die.

01:23:50.149 --> 01:23:52.307
Please, please
help me out of here!

01:23:56.748 --> 01:23:58.187
I can't.

01:23:58.189 --> 01:23:59.108
Mom, Mom!

01:24:02.628 --> 01:24:06.348
Mom, please!

01:24:08.670 --> 01:24:11.748
May she rise oh sunlight

01:24:13.109 --> 01:24:14.628
Your journey to pursue

01:24:14.630 --> 01:24:15.668
Help me.

01:24:17.909 --> 01:24:21.028
Your pretty little
feet they tread so sweet

01:24:23.430 --> 01:24:26.309
Strike up the morning dew

01:24:29.150 --> 01:24:33.589
Oh stay oh stay
you handsome maid

01:24:33.591 --> 01:24:37.749
And rest a moment here

01:24:37.751 --> 01:24:41.190
For there is none but you alone

01:24:42.832 --> 01:24:45.751
That I do love so dear

01:24:48.990 --> 01:24:53.549
For I am thine and
though art mine

01:24:53.551 --> 01:24:56.790
No man shall uncomfort thee

01:24:58.431 --> 01:25:02.750
We'll join our hands
in these bad lands

01:25:02.752 --> 01:25:05.830
Help me.

01:25:05.832 --> 01:25:08.391
Forever you and me.

01:26:21.917 --> 01:26:24.353
Don't move.

01:26:24.355 --> 01:26:27.274
So you're the one who
escaped blind eyed Bill.

01:26:29.516 --> 01:26:30.675
Blind eyed fool.

01:26:32.877 --> 01:26:35.353
And who are you?

01:26:35.355 --> 01:26:38.234
I'm the one who blinded
blind eyed Bill's blind eye.

01:26:40.676 --> 01:26:42.355
- You're the meat eater.
- Yeah.

01:26:45.518 --> 01:26:47.035
You're the
one who's responsible

01:26:47.037 --> 01:26:50.354
for everything my
family has suffered.

01:26:50.356 --> 01:26:52.435
But my name is
Everett Blackheart.

01:26:58.278 --> 01:26:59.516
Take
out your car keys

01:26:59.518 --> 01:27:01.317
and put them on the table.

01:27:05.837 --> 01:27:08.357
You made one fatal
mistake Everett.

01:27:08.359 --> 01:27:09.318
How so?

01:27:11.158 --> 01:27:14.757
You chose my
family for your meat grinder.

01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:34.158
Jessica.

01:27:37.319 --> 01:27:38.878
Mom I'm
breaking you out.

01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:40.718
What are you doing?

01:27:44.161 --> 01:27:45.199
Wait.

01:28:01.801 --> 01:28:03.360
Oh come on.

01:28:04.201 --> 01:28:08.120
Please come on,
come on.

01:28:08.122 --> 01:28:09.761
Oh no.

01:28:17.841 --> 01:28:19.520
Oh no.

01:28:19.761 --> 01:28:21.641
Come on.

01:29:51.365 --> 01:29:53.764
Help me, get him off.

01:29:59.766 --> 01:30:00.725
No.

01:30:02.247 --> 01:30:04.044
Oh no.

01:30:04.046 --> 01:30:06.965
Oh no it's Toby.

01:30:13.487 --> 01:30:14.926
No Toby, you killed him.

01:30:17.528 --> 01:30:18.407
I need him alive.

01:30:21.368 --> 01:30:23.366
We need him to find Sam.

01:30:23.368 --> 01:30:26.326
You didn't have to
shoot your brother.

01:30:28.648 --> 01:30:31.407
That wasn't Toby.

01:30:50.569 --> 01:30:54.328
Everett Blackheart you filth.

01:30:54.890 --> 01:30:56.848
You coward.

01:30:56.850 --> 01:30:59.567
What's he doing on my farm?

01:30:59.569 --> 01:31:01.248
You mean his farm.

01:31:04.329 --> 01:31:06.527
What is this?

01:31:06.529 --> 01:31:08.369
He's the meat eater.

01:31:13.449 --> 01:31:16.368
I always knew this business
better than you Hansen.

01:31:19.930 --> 01:31:22.049
I puppeteered you
like an obedient dog

01:31:24.650 --> 01:31:26.130
through these cruel years.

01:31:28.251 --> 01:31:31.250
And the vengeance tasted
even sweeter than I hoped.

01:31:33.572 --> 01:31:37.809
Sweeter than the flesh
carved from my livestock

01:31:37.811 --> 01:31:40.889
and by your grotesque
monster of a son.

01:31:40.891 --> 01:31:41.890
My son is dead.

01:31:43.971 --> 01:31:47.250
Good, he can rot
with his bitch mother

01:31:47.252 --> 01:31:50.250
in the stinking pits of hell.

01:31:50.252 --> 01:31:53.130
At least they left
behind a loyal husband

01:31:53.132 --> 01:31:56.410
and a loving father unlike

01:31:56.412 --> 01:31:59.891
Betty Blackheart's
coward of a husband.

01:31:59.893 --> 01:32:01.971
I watched you kill
my boys Hansen.

01:32:04.212 --> 01:32:07.251
I hid in the woods while
you buried their bodies.

01:32:09.974 --> 01:32:13.010
Waiting for the
single short moment

01:32:13.012 --> 01:32:14.891
when you would leave your gun.

01:32:16.613 --> 01:32:18.571
That moment never came.

01:32:18.573 --> 01:32:21.531
I never killed Betty,

01:32:21.533 --> 01:32:24.332
she had her legs severed
from her body by you!

01:32:25.934 --> 01:32:28.092
You bastard traitor.

01:32:28.854 --> 01:32:30.572
Let me know when it's boiled.

01:32:30.574 --> 01:32:33.054
Still you sold her flesh.

01:32:34.694 --> 01:32:37.853
It was a sadistic revenge
full of grief and hatred

01:32:39.534 --> 01:32:42.094
in my deranged blackened mind

01:32:44.175 --> 01:32:47.054
but your boys that was
the cruelest part of all

01:32:50.295 --> 01:32:52.173
because they live.

01:32:53.935 --> 01:32:56.853
Don't toy with me Hansen.

01:32:56.855 --> 01:32:59.293
I saw you dig their graves.

01:33:01.975 --> 01:33:07.615
You cravenly conducted
your insidious plot from afar

01:33:07.617 --> 01:33:15.577
whilst your boys were
here alive all this time.

01:33:20.176 --> 01:33:24.174
You take me to them Hansen,
you take me to them now.

01:33:24.176 --> 01:33:26.535
The names and details
of all your customers,

01:33:26.537 --> 01:33:28.376
I want them now.

01:33:40.377 --> 01:33:41.777
You think that's funny?

01:33:43.137 --> 01:33:46.296
Hansen may be old and done

01:33:46.298 --> 01:33:48.978
but if you fail to obey me you'll
never fucking laugh again.

01:33:55.298 --> 01:33:58.177
I want full names, I want
full details, start writing.

01:34:23.739 --> 01:34:27.458
No.

01:34:27.460 --> 01:34:30.459
This twisted business
of yours is dead.

01:34:43.381 --> 01:34:46.180
Take me to my sons and I will
give you the names I swear.

01:34:50.220 --> 01:34:53.059
Give us the names and then
we'll take you to your sons.

01:35:14.822 --> 01:35:15.860
Caleb?

01:35:19.103 --> 01:35:20.821
Joe?

01:35:34.583 --> 01:35:35.462
Oh Sammy.

01:35:36.743 --> 01:35:39.062
- Oh Sammy.
- Mom.

01:35:39.064 --> 01:35:41.661
You're okay, please
tell me you're okay.

01:35:41.663 --> 01:35:44.142
You're hurt.

01:35:44.144 --> 01:35:47.621
I'll be fine sweetheart
as long as you're all right.

01:35:47.623 --> 01:35:48.983
Tell me you're all right.

01:35:52.864 --> 01:35:55.822
Mom you need to leave.

01:35:55.824 --> 01:35:57.303
Listen to me, take the car,

01:35:57.305 --> 01:36:01.062
go as far as you can until
you find the nearest person.

01:36:01.064 --> 01:36:02.223
Let them take you the
rest of the way.

01:36:02.225 --> 01:36:04.343
Jess?

01:36:04.345 --> 01:36:06.022
You need to go
straight to hospital.

01:36:06.024 --> 01:36:07.742
What about you?

01:36:07.744 --> 01:36:09.144
I'm ending this.

01:36:10.586 --> 01:36:12.345
It's ended Jessica, come home

01:36:14.505 --> 01:36:17.943
and we can get far
away from this place.

01:36:17.945 --> 01:36:18.984
Come home?

01:36:20.945 --> 01:36:23.943
To what Katherine
there's nothing left.

01:36:23.945 --> 01:36:25.903
Me and Sam are what's left.

01:36:25.905 --> 01:36:30.143
I'm not leaving you
here on this farm.

01:36:30.145 --> 01:36:33.544
And I'm not leaving until
there's no farm left to leave.

01:36:45.346 --> 01:36:48.785
Are you going to be
all right sweetheart?

01:36:48.787 --> 01:36:51.625
Promise me you'll find us.

01:36:51.627 --> 01:36:54.385
You'll find us Jess.

01:36:54.387 --> 01:36:58.106
We'll be waiting for
you, don't forget that.

01:36:58.108 --> 01:37:00.826
We're still your family

01:37:00.828 --> 01:37:02.987
don't let them take
that away from us.

01:37:05.307 --> 01:37:06.186
I'm sorry.

01:37:08.588 --> 01:37:09.586
Come on Sam.

01:37:09.588 --> 01:37:11.067
No.

01:37:11.069 --> 01:37:12.228
Leave your sister.

01:37:15.908 --> 01:37:17.586
Look after him.

01:37:51.390 --> 01:37:52.789
Welcome to Hansen farm.

01:37:54.911 --> 01:37:57.268
In keeping with the
Hansen farm tradition

01:37:57.270 --> 01:38:00.869
you prisoners will not be fed.

01:38:00.871 --> 01:38:03.949
I know all too well your
appetite for human meat.

01:38:06.230 --> 01:38:09.189
All you have to pay for
the meat trapped beside you

01:38:12.150 --> 01:38:15.188
is the scar of guilt it
leaves on your conscience

01:38:15.190 --> 01:38:17.789
which clearly you
disgusting dogs don't feel.

01:38:20.391 --> 01:38:23.070
I hope that you have
families you'll miss.

01:38:23.072 --> 01:38:26.309
Parents who'll mourn you

01:38:26.311 --> 01:38:28.830
and children who'll know
that you failed them

01:38:28.832 --> 01:38:31.271
with your greed and
your perverted desires.

01:38:35.992 --> 01:38:38.831
The one who eats first
is the one who survives.

01:38:40.792 --> 01:38:42.791
That greedy piggy can go free.

01:38:44.233 --> 01:38:45.951
The rest of you will suffer

01:38:45.953 --> 01:38:48.111
for your cannibalistic
indulgences

01:38:48.113 --> 01:38:50.590
that have brought so much
destruction upon my life

01:38:50.592 --> 01:38:53.671
and so much death to this farm.

01:38:53.673 --> 01:38:55.552
Including you Hunt.

01:38:58.594 --> 01:39:01.792
I want you to climb into
the oven, close the door.

01:39:04.594 --> 01:39:07.031
I don't want to shoot you
down like a filthy animal.

01:39:07.033 --> 01:39:09.032
Revenge is
supposed to be ugly.

01:39:09.034 --> 01:39:11.393
This isn't revenge.

01:39:11.395 --> 01:39:14.632
This is so I don't
become like you.

01:39:14.634 --> 01:39:16.912
I do this my way for myself.

01:40:20.691 --> 01:40:23.796
