WEBVTT

00:04.800 --> 00:06.461
CARY:
We need money.

00:06.500 --> 00:08.036
Put simply, we
need more clients.

00:08.070 --> 00:08.991
JOHN:
Thank you.

00:09.040 --> 00:10.507
CARY:
Do you want to
hear this or not?

00:10.540 --> 00:12.201
We were all hurt by
our slow rollout.

00:12.240 --> 00:14.071
We didn't have an office;
what were we supposed to do?

00:14.110 --> 00:15.429
I'm not saying that
there's not a reason.

00:15.480 --> 00:17.209
I'm sick of being faced
with the painfully obvious.
What I am saying

00:17.250 --> 00:18.603
is that we need
more money...
Of course we do,

00:18.650 --> 00:19.719
but we don't
have any...
...and we need
clients...

00:19.750 --> 00:23.186
Okay. Okay! Okay.

00:23.220 --> 00:25.711
We're in the situation we're in.

00:25.750 --> 00:27.752
So what do we do about it?

00:28.760 --> 00:30.785
(conversing indistinctly)

00:30.830 --> 00:32.229
DIANE:
Okay! Okay.

00:32.260 --> 00:33.693
We're swamped.

00:33.730 --> 00:35.755
We have lost half
of our top lItIgators.

00:35.800 --> 00:37.119
HOWARD:
Yeah, and good riddance.

00:37.170 --> 00:39.593
And... and our caseload
has Increased.

00:39.640 --> 00:43.599
We have received continuances
on eight of our 12 open cases,

00:43.640 --> 00:45.608
but we need
to start hiring soon.

00:45.640 --> 00:47.073
DAVID:
We also need to get
our clients back.

00:47.110 --> 00:48.805
Losing Chumhum is
still an embarrassment.

00:48.840 --> 00:49.807
Yeah, but first things first.

00:49.850 --> 00:52.478
We _need four associates
wrth trIal experience.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.818
We also need to deal
with Florrick-Agos.

00:54.850 --> 00:56.818
No, we can't keep
obsessing about...

00:56.850 --> 00:58.488
No, no, no.
We need to move on.

00:58.520 --> 00:59.680
I have a great idea
about...
Wait, listen.

00:59.720 --> 01:00.755
We do both.

01:00.790 --> 01:02.519
No "first things first."

01:02.560 --> 01:04.528
We expedite hiring
and work on client loss.

01:04.560 --> 01:05.686
David,

01:05.730 --> 01:07.095
I want you
to form

01:07.130 --> 01:08.358
a client retention
workIng group.

01:08.400 --> 01:09.628
Bring our clients
back home.

01:09.670 --> 01:11.297
And, Diane...

01:12.400 --> 01:15.096
Howard, why don't you take over
the status meeting?

01:15.140 --> 01:16.767
Kalinda.

01:16.810 --> 01:17.731
We need new clients.

01:17.770 --> 01:19.601
We can't keep looking
to Lockhart/Gardner.

01:19.640 --> 01:21.369
ROBYN:
How about a Christmas party?

01:22.680 --> 01:25.569
How about what?

01:25.610 --> 01:26.770
Well, we had a slow rollout

01:26.820 --> 01:28.048
because_we didn't have
office space,

01:28.080 --> 01:32.380
and now we have office space,
so let's have a real rollout.

01:32.420 --> 01:35.514
ASSISTANT:
Mrs. Florrick, you
have a phone call.

01:35.560 --> 01:38.552
I'll be right back.

01:38.590 --> 01:41.252
It's someone_ who said he was
an old client of yours,

01:41.300 --> 01:43.188
a Zayeed Shaheed.

01:43.230 --> 01:44.265
Zayeed, yes, thanks.

01:44.300 --> 01:46.837
Zayeed?

01:46.870 --> 01:48.269
Yes, it's Alicia.

01:48.300 --> 01:49.267
How are you doing?

01:49.310 --> 01:51.505
ZAYEED:
Uh, fine, thank you.

01:51.540 --> 01:53.531
Look, Alicia,
I hate to be blunt,

01:53.580 --> 01:56.299
but I could use your help
with a problem right now.

01:56.350 --> 01:57.908
Okay, uh, what is it?

01:57.950 --> 02:01.613
A university colleague is trying
to get a job as a CIA analyst,

02:01.650 --> 02:04.539
and the FBI is here
asking some questions about him

02:04.590 --> 02:06.558
for a background check.
Okay, where's here?

02:06.590 --> 02:08.478
My home. Why?

02:08.520 --> 02:09.521
Uh, no reason.

02:09.560 --> 02:10.584
Keep going.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.848
Well, their questions
are getting more personal,

02:12.900 --> 02:14.697
and I'm worried about getting
this person in trouble.

02:14.730 --> 02:15.799
A-Are you still
on campus?

02:15.830 --> 02:17.422
I am-- 2143 Burnham.

02:17.470 --> 02:18.869
Okay, I'm coming to you.

02:18.900 --> 02:20.868
Ask the federal agents politely

02:20.900 --> 02:24.301
to wait until I get there
for more questioning, okay?

02:24.340 --> 02:25.307
Okay.

02:25.340 --> 02:26.500
Robyn, I need you
as a witness.

02:26.540 --> 02:28.235
New client?
Old.

02:28.280 --> 02:29.941
With money?
Some.

02:29.980 --> 02:32.278
WOMAN:
Lauralee Gregg.

02:32.320 --> 02:33.469
Tulane undergrad,
Yale School of Law,

02:33.520 --> 02:34.839
ten years
at McKinley, Barrett and Skiff.

02:34.880 --> 02:36.245
No.

02:36.290 --> 02:37.917
May I ask why?

02:37.950 --> 02:39.315
Ten years at
McKinley and Barrett,

02:39.360 --> 02:41.487
and she was second chair
on her last case.

02:41.520 --> 02:43.727
I wouldn't read
anything into that.

02:43.760 --> 02:44.852
I do.

02:46.530 --> 02:48.498
David Benjamin
Goldbaum.

02:48.530 --> 02:49.895
Georgetown undergrad,
Stanford...

02:49.930 --> 02:51.329
Next.

02:51.370 --> 02:53.531
(sighs)
Will, if you don't
snap him up,

02:53.570 --> 02:55.595
Fisher & Chung will.

02:55.640 --> 02:56.607
That makes sense.

02:56.640 --> 02:58.369
Uh, David's a
great litigator.

02:58.410 --> 03:00.332
We lost to him in court.
No, we settled with him.

03:00.380 --> 03:02.701
Yeah, for $2 million.
Which should have been four.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.877
So you're rejecting
him because he wasn't
hard enough on you?

03:04.910 --> 03:07.378
Yes.

03:13.260 --> 03:14.215
Who was that?

03:14.260 --> 03:17.388
It's no one,
not appropriate.

03:17.430 --> 03:19.398
Beth, we're not
who we were.

03:19.430 --> 03:21.728
What was inappropriate
two months ago

03:21.760 --> 03:23.193
is appropriate now.

03:25.400 --> 03:27.368
Damian Boyle.

03:27.400 --> 03:30.233
He's been in private practice
for 15 years-- criminal law.

03:30.270 --> 03:32.807
His clients are, well,
not your clients.

03:32.840 --> 03:33.932
DIANE:
Pro bono?

03:33.980 --> 03:36.972
No, very not pro bono.

03:37.010 --> 03:39.513
Antonio Pola last year,

03:39.550 --> 03:40.517
Sal Calastana.

03:40.550 --> 03:41.778
Where's his photo?

03:41.820 --> 03:43.913
He doesn't like
being photographed.

03:43.950 --> 03:45.486
He's looking
for a home.

03:45.520 --> 03:47.488
Some of his top clients
are in prison now

03:47.520 --> 03:48.782
and he needs to
make ends meet.

03:48.820 --> 03:50.822
The problem is,
nobody wants him.

03:52.560 --> 03:54.619
DIANE:
Will,

03:54.660 --> 03:57.629
just because someone is wrong
for us doesn't make him right.

03:57.670 --> 03:59.638
Let's see him.

03:59.670 --> 04:02.036
What can it hurt?

04:02.070 --> 04:03.537
Alicia, thanks
for doing this.

04:03.570 --> 04:04.707
No problem--
are they still here?

04:04.740 --> 04:06.503
Yes, they decided to stay.

04:06.540 --> 04:07.507
They're a little
impatient.

04:07.540 --> 04:08.529
Play it sweet.

04:08.580 --> 04:10.343
After we're introduced,
ask them if you can record

04:10.380 --> 04:13.543
the interview
for your records.

04:13.580 --> 04:14.478
Thanks for waiting.

04:14.520 --> 04:16.841
Call it a lawyerly
overabundance of caution.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.812
So, this is about
Mr. Shaheed's colleague?

04:18.850 --> 04:21.353
Yes, Ezzedine Kalb.

04:21.390 --> 04:22.357
We just had a
few questions.

04:22.390 --> 04:25.450
Now, Mr. Kalb was in
Milwaukee recently with you?

04:25.490 --> 04:26.957
Do you mind
if I tape this?

04:27.000 --> 04:27.955
This interview?

04:28.000 --> 04:29.592
Why?

04:29.630 --> 04:31.689
Oh, for our records.
We do it all the time.

04:31.730 --> 04:32.867
I'm, I'm bad
at taking notes.

04:32.900 --> 04:34.436
We'd rather this
be off the record.

04:34.470 --> 04:35.732
Oh, it will be.

04:35.770 --> 04:38.307
I just need a,
a correct record for my notes.

04:38.340 --> 04:40.479
(chuckles)
Robyn's a stickler for detail.

04:43.480 --> 04:46.347
Certainly, if it's
for your notes.

04:46.380 --> 04:47.972
You were in Milwaukee with
your colleague two weeks ago?

04:48.020 --> 04:49.442
Yes.

04:49.490 --> 04:51.048
And why were
you there?

04:51.090 --> 04:52.114
For a conference

04:52.150 --> 04:55.586
on educational differences
In developing countries.

04:55.620 --> 04:56.655
I see.

04:56.690 --> 04:59.329
And did you spend the
whole time with Mr. Kalb?

04:59.360 --> 05:00.452
No, not the whole time.

05:00.500 --> 05:01.853
And what about
the afternoon

05:01.900 --> 05:03.094
of October 15?

05:03.130 --> 05:05.519
The 15th this year?

05:05.570 --> 05:06.992
Yes.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.565
The day of the explosion

05:09.610 --> 05:11.066
at the Milwaukee
Food Festival?

05:11.110 --> 05:13.476
Yes, I think that's right.

05:13.510 --> 05:16.445
I'm gonna ask my client

05:16.480 --> 05:17.970
to stop answering questions
at this time.

05:18.010 --> 05:19.511
Why?

05:19.550 --> 05:20.574
Because I don't think
this interview

05:20.620 --> 05:21.678
is what you're implying.

05:21.720 --> 05:22.880
What do you think
we're implying?

05:22.920 --> 05:24.547
Zayeed, you can ask them
to leave now.

05:24.590 --> 05:26.615
No, he can't.

05:26.660 --> 05:27.718
This is a warrant

05:27.760 --> 05:32.527
for computers, files, iPads,
smartphones, and papers

05:32.560 --> 05:34.118
in the possession
of your client.
Zayeed,

05:34.160 --> 05:36.594
I need you to step out
of the room for a second.

05:36.630 --> 05:37.699
Robyn, can you take him?

05:37.730 --> 05:38.765
Actually, Agent Anderson,
will you accompany them

05:38.800 --> 05:41.837
to make sure no materials
subject to the warrant

05:41.870 --> 05:43.007
are disturbed?

05:44.640 --> 05:46.574
It's the color of my skin.

05:46.610 --> 05:47.872
They thinkI planted a bomb.

05:47.910 --> 05:48.899
Shh.

05:48.940 --> 05:50.942
Zayeed, were you anywhere
near the bomb site?

05:50.980 --> 05:52.140
No, I barely left
the hotel.

05:52.180 --> 05:53.147
What hotel?

05:53.180 --> 05:54.909
The Sheraton.
Well,

05:54.950 --> 05:56.440
where were you at the
time of the explosion?

05:56.490 --> 05:57.479
In my room.

05:58.650 --> 06:00.789
What are they going to find
on your computer, Zayeed?

06:00.820 --> 06:02.754
Nothing-- my book,
my lectures.

06:02.790 --> 06:04.382
No porn, no foreign financing?

06:04.430 --> 06:06.421
Anything that needs
to be explained.

06:09.430 --> 06:10.397
No.

06:10.430 --> 06:11.692
Tell us now.

06:11.730 --> 06:13.834
We'll find out later.

06:13.870 --> 06:15.929
Look, the subject matter
of my book is jihad--

06:15.970 --> 06:18.768
not violent jihad--
spiritual jihad,

06:18.810 --> 06:20.971
but the materials can be open
to misinterpretation.

06:21.010 --> 06:23.069
Okay, stay out
of their way

06:23.110 --> 06:24.577
and don't answer
any more questions.

06:24.610 --> 06:25.645
Where are you going?

06:25.680 --> 06:26.908
To quash the warrant.

06:26.950 --> 06:27.939
MAN:
Your Honor!

06:29.990 --> 06:31.981
Why are you yelling?
I'm not yelling.

06:32.020 --> 06:33.453
I'm passionate,
Your Honor.

06:33.490 --> 06:34.457
The abuse here

06:34.490 --> 06:35.787
is passion-inducing.

06:35.820 --> 06:36.821
Passion-inducing?

06:36.860 --> 06:39.078
Well, goodness, let's not have
our passion induced.

06:39.130 --> 06:41.496
So let me get this
straight--

06:41.530 --> 06:44.067
you want me to bar him
from representing him.

06:44.100 --> 06:45.067
That's your requested remedy?

06:45.100 --> 06:45.896
Yes, Your Honor.

06:45.930 --> 06:47.795
Damian Boyle is not
just representing

06:47.840 --> 06:49.535
the Gerraghty
crime family.

06:49.570 --> 06:51.800
He's a member of the
Gerraghty crime family.
Why,

06:51.840 --> 06:53.205
because I'm Irish?
That has nothing
to do with it.

06:53.240 --> 06:54.605
Or is it because I've beaten
you three times In court?

06:54.640 --> 06:57.438
You haven't beaten _me.
Your Honor, I am a srmple
small-town lawyer...

06:57.480 --> 06:58.447
KLUGER:
I have an idea.

06:58.480 --> 07:00.641
Why don't you stand up?

07:00.680 --> 07:01.817
DAMIAN_:
My apologies.

07:01.850 --> 07:04.739
Your Honor, I am
a simple small-town lawyer

07:04.790 --> 07:08.157
who's come to the big city to
defend an honest businessman,

07:08.190 --> 07:10.556
and I've beaten
the AUSA three times,

07:10.590 --> 07:12.455
in three previous
court hearings,

07:12.500 --> 07:13.592
and that's why
he wants to bar me

07:13.630 --> 07:15.848
from representing
an innocent man, but--

07:15.900 --> 07:18.721
correct me if I'm wrong--
this is America,

07:18.770 --> 07:20.237
and I'll be damned
if I'm going to let

07:20.270 --> 07:21.237
this man_ tread
on my rights,

07:21.270 --> 07:23.238
your rights,
or anyone's rights.

07:23.270 --> 07:26.671
Thank you, that was
a beautiful speech.

07:26.710 --> 07:27.870
You're welcome.
I know we work

07:27.910 --> 07:29.571
in a cynical business,
Your Honor, but

07:29.610 --> 07:30.702
I believe it.

07:30.750 --> 07:33.116
Your Honor, we have federal
wiretaps with Mr. Boyle

07:33.150 --> 07:34.777
conducting business for the
Gerraghty crime syndicate.

07:34.820 --> 07:35.878
Oh, really?

07:35.920 --> 07:36.887
Well, let's hear it.

07:36.920 --> 07:37.887
KLUGER:
Mr. Boyle, please,

07:37.920 --> 07:39.808
let me do my job.

07:39.860 --> 07:40.815
Let's hear it.

07:40.860 --> 07:42.157
The taps are sealed,
Your Honor,

07:42.190 --> 07:43.487
part of a wider
investigation.

07:43.530 --> 07:44.326
(laughing)

07:44.360 --> 07:45.622
Yeah, keep,
keep laughing, Mr. Boyle,

07:45.660 --> 07:47.628
keep-- we're coming
after you with wiretaps!
Your Honor, come on,

07:47.660 --> 07:49.150
what have I done to
this man, really,

07:49.200 --> 07:51.691
except beat him
fair and square?

07:51.730 --> 07:53.493
ALICIA:
Your Honor, this warrant
should be quashed.

07:53.540 --> 07:55.633
It's racial profiling,
pure and simple.

07:55.670 --> 07:57.206
The_ FBI doesn't
raCIally profile.

07:57.240 --> 07:59.037
He was a dark-skinned man
visiting Milwaukee.

07:59.070 --> 08:01.038
A dark-skinned man
advocating jihad.

08:01.080 --> 08:02.707
Not the jihad
of violent overthrow.

08:02.750 --> 08:03.876
Your Honor,

08:03.910 --> 08:06.276
we don't need to prove that
Zayeed Shaheed planted a bomb.

08:06.310 --> 08:07.277
We only need
to prove...

08:07.320 --> 08:08.878
That there is more evidence

08:08.920 --> 08:11.047
than Mr. Shaheed's name
and the color of his skin.

08:11.090 --> 08:13.513
My client was nowhere
near the crime scene

08:13.560 --> 08:15.187
before or after the bombing.

08:15.220 --> 08:17.654
He was in room 546...

08:17.690 --> 08:20.989
Your Honor,
this picture was taken

08:21.030 --> 08:22.725
two minutes prior
to the fateful explosion,

08:22.770 --> 08:23.919
and as you can see,

08:23.970 --> 08:25.597
that is

08:25.630 --> 08:27.666
Zayeed Shaheed passing
the garbage can

08:27.700 --> 08:28.632
where the bomb
was placed,

08:28.670 --> 08:32.231
but I would love to hear
more about Mr. Shaheed

08:32.270 --> 08:34.079
being in room 546.

08:36.210 --> 08:38.098
(laughter)

08:39.720 --> 08:42.245
Uh, if there are legal papers
anywhere on your person,

08:42.280 --> 08:44.544
I suggest you keep walking.

08:44.590 --> 08:45.545
(laughs)

08:45.590 --> 08:47.012
Will Gardner.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.550
I'm a partner at LG.

08:49.730 --> 08:50.958
Lockhart/Gardner.

08:50.990 --> 08:51.957
Oh,

08:51.990 --> 08:53.196
congratulations.

08:53.230 --> 08:54.197
What do you want?

08:54.230 --> 08:55.549
I saw you in
court today.

08:55.600 --> 08:56.692
Can I buy you a drink?

08:56.730 --> 09:00.234
Another black, please.

09:00.270 --> 09:02.090
(mutters indistinctly)

09:02.140 --> 09:04.233
(laughter)

09:04.270 --> 09:05.703
What was that?

09:05.740 --> 09:06.707
(clears throat)

09:06.740 --> 09:08.276
Jewish joke.

09:08.310 --> 09:09.743
Ah.

09:09.780 --> 09:11.645
Has he heard the one
about the Irish pilot?

09:11.680 --> 09:13.671
He has, yeah.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.938
So, you drinking or what?

09:15.980 --> 09:16.981
Another black.

09:17.020 --> 09:20.353
You're gonna lose the case
against the government.

09:20.390 --> 09:21.357
It happens.

09:21.390 --> 09:22.823
The judges are just human.

09:22.860 --> 09:24.350
They don't mind pissing off
an individual lawyer.

09:24.390 --> 09:26.620
They do think twice
when it's a whole law firm.

09:26.660 --> 09:30.027
What's the name of
your firm again, pal?

09:30.070 --> 09:31.719
Lockhart/Gardner.

09:31.770 --> 09:33.738
Hmm, never heard of it.

09:33.770 --> 09:35.738
What firms
have you heard of?

09:35.770 --> 09:36.737
(chuckles)

09:36.770 --> 09:38.738
You still looking
for a home?

09:38.770 --> 09:39.998
Why, you offering me a job?

09:40.040 --> 09:42.645
I might be.

09:42.680 --> 09:43.647
(sniffs)

09:43.680 --> 09:45.898
(clears throat)

09:45.950 --> 09:48.748
There are friends...
I have

09:48.780 --> 09:51.783
that I defend
no matter what.

09:51.820 --> 09:53.014
Do they have money?

09:54.320 --> 09:56.083
Then that's not a problem.

09:56.120 --> 09:57.883
I don't work Sundays.

09:57.930 --> 09:59.022
Why not?
(clears throat)

09:59.060 --> 10:01.620
What do you care?
Okay.

10:01.660 --> 10:03.821
You work twice as
hard during the week,
I'm fine with that.

10:03.870 --> 10:05.861
Okay.

10:07.800 --> 10:10.109
Let me think about it.

10:10.140 --> 10:12.028
ZAYEED:
That's not me, I swear.

10:12.070 --> 10:14.174
You were in your hotel room
taking a nap?
Yes,

10:14.210 --> 10:15.336
I was in my hotel room.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.101
I was tired.

10:18.150 --> 10:19.242
And no one saw you there.

10:19.280 --> 10:21.919
I didn't have anything
to do with this.

10:23.350 --> 10:24.487
I'm a teacher,
that's all.
AllCla.

10:28.360 --> 10:30.248
Is it a surveillance camera?

10:30.290 --> 10:31.257
No, see up here--

10:31.290 --> 10:33.190
this blur?
Yeah.

10:33.230 --> 10:35.790
I thought that was
a thumb fro_m_someone
usmg their iPhone.

10:35.830 --> 10:37.422
A tourist photo?

10:37.470 --> 10:38.789
How'd it get to the FBI?

10:38.830 --> 10:39.728
Scabbit-- the Web site.

10:39.770 --> 10:42.330
There's a thread
on the Milwaukee bombing,

10:42.370 --> 10:44.235
and everybody's talking
about who might have done it,

10:44.270 --> 10:45.931
like the Boston Marathon.

10:45.970 --> 10:46.868
There.

10:46.910 --> 10:49.276
The FBI is getting
their photos from Scabbit?

10:49.310 --> 10:50.379
Yeah, it looks like it.

10:50.410 --> 10:51.377
And one other thing--

10:51.410 --> 10:52.946
if the feds are
using Scabbit,

10:52.980 --> 10:54.379
then Zayeed is
in real trouble.
Why?

10:54.420 --> 10:56.274
Well, the people on
here think he did it,

10:56.320 --> 10:57.844
and they say they
can prove it.

11:17.870 --> 11:22.307
And Peter's been so sweet to me.
He sent a car for me.

11:22.340 --> 11:23.443
A town car.

11:23.480 --> 11:24.947
Oh.

11:24.980 --> 11:29.371
Oh, being the governor's mom
has certain advantages,

11:29.420 --> 11:30.739
but it's not just, uh...

11:33.790 --> 11:37.886
Mm. Would you excuse me
for just one minute?

11:40.860 --> 11:42.725
Jackie.

11:42.770 --> 11:44.761
What a surprise.
Mr. Gold.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.734
Rachel!

11:46.770 --> 11:48.499
Oh, you two know
each other.
Yes, I clerked

11:48.540 --> 11:50.235
for her husband
a zillion years ago.

11:50.270 --> 11:51.464
Nice to see you, Jackie.

11:51.510 --> 11:53.899
Rachel was the judge's
favorite clerk.

11:53.940 --> 11:56.841
Well, hats off for
not playing that
card with Peter.

11:56.880 --> 11:58.871
With Peter?
Yes.

11:58.910 --> 12:00.411
Rachel's the new
Supreme Court candidate

12:00.450 --> 12:02.315
to replace
Diane Lockhart.

12:03.790 --> 12:06.418
Oh, well, then congratulations
are certainly in order.

12:06.450 --> 12:08.918
The judge
would be proud.

12:08.960 --> 12:11.884
Well, thank you, Jackie.
That means the world.
Yes, well,

12:11.930 --> 12:14.023
I'll let you two get back
to your meeting.

12:14.060 --> 12:16.392
Mr. Gold, could
I speak to you for just

12:16.430 --> 12:18.295
one minute?

12:18.330 --> 12:19.467
Sure.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.297
JACKIE:
Tell her no.

12:21.340 --> 12:23.433
She's not getting the
Supreme Court seat.

12:23.470 --> 12:25.938
Really? Why is that?

12:25.970 --> 12:28.074
Let her down gently.
Jackie.

12:29.110 --> 12:30.543
No.

12:30.580 --> 12:33.219
You get to decorate
the offices and throw

12:33.250 --> 12:34.911
the inaugural ball,
but this,

12:34.950 --> 12:36.508
this is my prerogative.

12:36.550 --> 12:39.041
This is Peter's prerogative.

12:39.090 --> 12:42.287
Whatever grudge you have,
you need to suck it up.

12:43.330 --> 12:45.321
Good seeing you.

12:47.460 --> 12:48.358
ALICIA:
That's not him.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.197
CAREY: Then go to the FBI
with a proffer.

12:50.230 --> 12:52.869
Explain the jihad stuff.
Show the Feds that's not him.

12:52.900 --> 12:55.334
ROBYN:
There's another photo.
Someone just uploaded it.

12:55.370 --> 12:57.338
What?! Of Zayeed?

12:57.370 --> 12:58.906
You're kidding.

12:58.940 --> 13:00.578
"Zayeed Shaheed
fleeing the bombing.

13:00.610 --> 13:02.271
"Police should do something.

13:02.310 --> 13:05.473
Signed Sharkbit678."
ALICIA:
That doesn't even make sense.

13:05.510 --> 13:06.818
He's skating.

13:06.850 --> 13:08.169
It doesn't look
like him, either.

13:08.220 --> 13:10.484
Ah, "That's not Zayeed.
That's his accomplice.

13:10.520 --> 13:12.909
"See the walkie-talkie
in his back pocket?

13:12.960 --> 13:14.587
Laoshunt93."

13:14.620 --> 13:16.827
*

13:40.320 --> 13:42.049
Oh, my God,
this stuff is crazy.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.616
What's crazy is
the FBI using it.

13:43.650 --> 13:45.880
Sue for an injunction.

13:45.920 --> 13:48.059
What?
Against Scabbit.

13:48.090 --> 13:49.955
Force them
to take down the thread.

13:49.990 --> 13:51.855
What'll that do?
If the FBI is using

13:51.890 --> 13:54.051
crowd-sourcing for
its investigation,
cut off the supply.

13:54.100 --> 13:55.590
Good. I'll go to court.

13:55.630 --> 13:57.860
I'll make
the proffer.

13:57.900 --> 13:59.458
(loud, indistinct chatter)

13:59.500 --> 14:01.331
We didn't vote
on this.

14:01.370 --> 14:03.531
Yes, but we discussed
hiring a new partner.

14:03.570 --> 14:05.003
At a meeting you left.

14:05.040 --> 14:06.871
Yes, but I got a sense
of the room,

14:06.910 --> 14:08.935
and the sense was that
we wanted to hire somebody.

14:08.980 --> 14:10.641
Wait, what is this "sense
of the room" crap?

14:10.680 --> 14:13.069
When did that start
replacmg votes?

14:13.120 --> 14:14.269
Who is this
guy anyway?

14:14.320 --> 14:15.617
Damian Boyle.
He's a top litigator.

14:15.650 --> 14:18.016
If we didn't act,
he would've been snapped up.

14:18.050 --> 14:19.415
DAVID: He's
a mob lavwer.

14:19.450 --> 14:22.089
No, he's not.
Will. Will,
that is not true.

14:23.130 --> 14:24.620
What's not true?

14:24.660 --> 14:26.252
What you just said.

14:26.290 --> 14:27.894
He wouldn't have
been snapped up.

14:27.930 --> 14:29.557
Our headhunter told us
the exact opposite.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.261
Oh, so the truth
comes out.

14:31.300 --> 14:34.030
Look... decisions sometimes
need to be made on the fly.

14:34.070 --> 14:36.231
In my opinion,
this was one of them.

14:36.270 --> 14:39.899
If you disagree...
sanction me.
Okay.

14:39.940 --> 14:43.273
(loud, indistinct chatter)

14:43.310 --> 14:45.301
Excuse me.

14:45.350 --> 14:48.376
Is it always
like this?
No.

14:48.420 --> 14:51.309
The last few weeks.
What's this?
This song.

14:51.350 --> 14:54.114
(whistling tune)

14:54.160 --> 14:56.458
I have no idea.

14:56.490 --> 14:58.321
Oh, don't you
hate that,

14:58.360 --> 15:00.692
when a song gets...
stuck in your head?

15:00.730 --> 15:02.391
More than anything.

15:02.430 --> 15:04.967
You have very pretty eyes.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.231
No, I don't.
No, you do, you do.
And I know from pretty eyes.

15:08.270 --> 15:11.000
Damian, you're on the
client-retention working group.
Yeah. Hold on.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.008
(Damian whistling tune)

15:13.040 --> 15:14.337
Will.

15:14.380 --> 15:16.200
You can't be doing this.
Doing what?

15:16.240 --> 15:17.343
Making this firm grow?
Making decisions

15:17.380 --> 15:19.974
before they get
argued to death?
This was a decision

15:20.020 --> 15:22.648
that could've_ used
some argumg.
You know how
this works, Diane.

15:22.680 --> 15:24.318
David Lee argues
for a relative.

15:24.350 --> 15:26.386
You say no.
It's referred to
a subcommittee.

15:26.420 --> 15:29.548
They take three weeks, and
come back with a stalemate.
You don't know that.

15:29.590 --> 15:33.026
I do_ know that. At a
certain p0int, someone
just needs to decide.

15:33.060 --> 15:35.119
We don't have the
luxury of being a
deadlocked government.

15:39.230 --> 15:41.232
Well, then welcome
to your decision.

15:41.270 --> 15:44.000
Because that's what happens
when one person decides.

15:46.470 --> 15:48.472
You can always call me there.
I'm just saying.

15:48.510 --> 15:50.102
Oh. Okay.

15:52.750 --> 15:54.547
(sighs)

15:54.580 --> 15:56.172
What did he say?

15:56.220 --> 15:58.438
He's sick of debate.
Yeah, well,

15:58.490 --> 16:00.685
I don't give a damn--
this isn't communist Russia.

16:00.720 --> 16:03.257
Well, what do you want me to do?
(sighs)

16:03.290 --> 16:06.157
Sanction Will, and get this
new lawyer kicked out.

16:06.190 --> 16:09.353
David, a month ago
you wanted me kicked out.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.527
Yeah, so?
That was a month ago.

16:11.570 --> 16:13.492
I have two-thirds
of the partners

16:13.540 --> 16:15.997
ready to dump him.
Will?

16:16.040 --> 16:17.769
No. Him.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.734
Mr. Mob.

16:20.780 --> 16:23.669
They want to know
if you're on board.

16:23.710 --> 16:26.247
*

16:26.280 --> 16:27.349
Hello again.
Hello again to you,

16:27.380 --> 16:30.144
Your Honor.
I hear you started
your own law firm.

16:30.190 --> 16:32.112
Uh, y-yes, Your Honor.

16:32.150 --> 16:34.152
Three weeks in.
Congratulations.

16:34.190 --> 16:36.556
What brings you
to brighten my courtroom today?

16:36.590 --> 16:39.024
An injunction, Your Honor,
against Scabbit,

16:39.060 --> 16:41.221
a social news _
and entertainment Site

16:41.260 --> 16:43.228
where users post
or link to content.

16:43.270 --> 16:45.693
I see we seem
to be alone here today.
Yes,

16:45.730 --> 16:48.290
Your Honor.
Scabbit has ignored
our subpoenas.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.661
We believe this
is brinkmanship
through absence.
Okay,

16:50.710 --> 16:51.859
I'm not gonna grant
an injunction against

16:51.910 --> 16:54.401
a whole Web site without letting
them air their arguments.

16:54.440 --> 16:55.668
We're not asking
for an injunction

16:55.710 --> 16:57.302
against the whole Web site,
Your Honor,

16:57.350 --> 16:59.102
just one thread
on that site: a thread

16:59.150 --> 17:02.039
that disparages
our client.
Okay. Uh, give me

17:02.080 --> 17:04.082
all the relevant evidence,
and I will rule.

17:04.120 --> 17:06.645
And, of course, it's
good seeing you again.

17:06.690 --> 17:09.318
Can you do me a favor?
Next time, can you bring me back

17:09.360 --> 17:10.679
something just
a little more serious,

17:10.730 --> 17:13.119
I don't know, like a...
a grocery store robbery?

17:13.160 --> 17:14.457
Definitely, Your Honor.

17:14.500 --> 17:15.592
DIANE:
Three ayes.

17:15.630 --> 17:17.723
All opposed?

17:17.770 --> 17:19.590
Four opposed.

17:19.630 --> 17:21.393
Are you an abstention,

17:21.440 --> 17:23.533
Mr. Boyle?

17:23.570 --> 17:24.798
What?

17:24.840 --> 17:26.535
Are you abstaining?

17:26.570 --> 17:27.776
To what?

17:27.810 --> 17:30.244
Whether we should negotiate
with Florrick-Agos

17:30.280 --> 17:32.805
to share the ongoing
Chumhum privacy suit?

17:32.850 --> 17:34.613
This is the firm that
stole your clients?

17:34.650 --> 17:36.345
Yes.

17:36.380 --> 17:39.213
And _that's one of the...
clients they stole?

17:39.250 --> 17:41.354
Yes, it's a top client.
$35 million a year

17:41.390 --> 17:42.687
in billables.

17:42.720 --> 17:44.779
$35 million?
DAVID:
Why don't you try

17:44.830 --> 17:47.424
listening next time?
And you want to
negotiate with them?

17:47.460 --> 17:49.451
They stole $35 million
a year from you,

17:49.500 --> 17:50.797
and you want to negotiate?

17:50.830 --> 17:53.230
DAVID:
Just vote, okay?
Sure.

17:53.270 --> 17:54.532
Which way do I vote
to get buggered?

17:54.570 --> 17:55.832
All right, I'll mark you
down as an abstention.

17:55.870 --> 17:56.768
What are you doing?

17:56.800 --> 17:58.802
What am I doing?
Yeah.

17:58.840 --> 18:00.808
Is this the_client-retention
working group?

18:00.840 --> 18:02.501
Yeah. You got a minute?

18:02.540 --> 18:04.405
Yeah.
Come on.

18:04.450 --> 18:05.747
You.

18:05.780 --> 18:07.338
What do you
do here?

18:07.380 --> 18:09.314
Doesn't _matter. You're
coming With me, all right?

18:09.350 --> 18:11.887
You, too.
Ditch the jackets.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.888
What are you doing?
Working.

18:13.920 --> 18:17.651
Nah. You get lunch
off. Come on.

18:17.690 --> 18:19.248
Come on.

18:19.290 --> 18:21.554
I'm taking a legal field trip.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.192
Florrick-Agos & Associates.

18:23.230 --> 18:25.369
No, Mr. Agos is
at lunch right now.

18:25.400 --> 18:26.560
May I take a message?

18:26.600 --> 18:29.262
Wait, that might be him. Wait.

18:29.300 --> 18:32.736
How's it going?
One second.
No, that's not him.

18:32.770 --> 18:35.477
Right, everything.
Lamps, too.

18:35.510 --> 18:36.772
Excuse me, hello?

18:36.810 --> 18:38.539
Hello. Yes, we're here
with the rental company.

18:38.580 --> 18:40.377
They wanted us
to swap out the furniture.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.775
I-I didn't know
anything about that.
Yeah, well,

18:42.820 --> 18:44.788
we just got the call
ourselves. Howard,

18:44.820 --> 18:45.639
call the office,

18:45.690 --> 18:48.158
and tell them
we're on our way.
What?

18:48.190 --> 18:51.250
(chuckles): Howard.
Call the office and
tell them we're on our way.

18:51.290 --> 18:52.279
We'll be really quick.

18:52.330 --> 18:53.627
Right? Just
let us know if

18:53.660 --> 18:54.695
we get in the way.

18:54.730 --> 18:56.197
(phone ringing)
Sure.

18:56.230 --> 18:57.720
Cheers, love.

18:57.770 --> 18:59.920
Oh, careful
with those, now, guys.

18:59.970 --> 19:02.837
All of it into
the freight elevator.

19:06.870 --> 19:08.872
*

19:19.650 --> 19:21.686
Oh...

19:23.230 --> 19:24.629
ROBYN:
It's gone.

19:24.660 --> 19:26.287
The thread?

19:26.330 --> 19:28.298
Yeah. _"Due_ to
legal injunction,

19:28.330 --> 19:30.469
this thread has been
removed by the owners."

19:30.500 --> 19:32.695
Well, the law works--
even on the Internet.

19:32.730 --> 19:34.266
Uh-oh.
What?

19:34.300 --> 19:35.892
There's another thread?
There's another
thread.

19:35.940 --> 19:38.864
It just popped up.
"Bombing suspect
still at large."

19:38.910 --> 19:40.707
Does it mention Zayeed?

19:44.510 --> 19:46.740
This is Whac-A-Mole.

19:46.780 --> 19:49.874
We get an injunction
on one thread, and
another one pops up.

19:49.920 --> 19:52.980
We need to get Scabbit
in court.

19:53.020 --> 19:56.183
Well, the judge leans our way;
maybe they'll sanction him.

19:59.830 --> 20:01.957
Oh, yeah, the, uh,
movers came, and they said

20:02.000 --> 20:04.628
they should have the furniture
here in about an hour.

20:04.670 --> 20:07.867
*

20:07.900 --> 20:11.904
Peter, I need you
to get on the phone
with one of the...

20:11.940 --> 20:16.229
You_cannot let Peter
app0int Rachel Keyser.

20:17.410 --> 20:19.549
Give me a minute, Nora.

20:21.550 --> 20:23.381
He has already
appointed her.

20:23.420 --> 20:25.809
Then tell him he made a mistake.
(sighs)

20:25.850 --> 20:29.752
I thought you said she
was the judge's favorite.

20:29.790 --> 20:31.621
She was.

20:33.860 --> 20:35.327
Oh.

20:37.400 --> 20:39.368
Oh.
I will not have

20:39.400 --> 20:41.630
a woman who slept
with my husband,

20:41.670 --> 20:45.834
and al... almost ruined
my family,

20:45.870 --> 20:49.670
be_ rewarded with _a seat
in my son's cabinet.

20:51.480 --> 20:53.311
Does Peter know?

20:55.980 --> 20:57.743
(sighs)

20:57.790 --> 21:00.042
I'm sorry, Jackie.

21:00.090 --> 21:02.058
I understand why you're upset.

21:02.090 --> 21:04.058
No. You don't.

21:04.090 --> 21:07.958
That's true, I don't,
but my hands are tied here.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.558
Peter has already
reversed the appointment

21:09.600 --> 21:10.726
of one female candidate.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.726
He can't do it again.

21:12.770 --> 21:15.739
You don't want me to go
to my son about this.

21:15.770 --> 21:18.330
No, you're right, I don't.

21:19.670 --> 21:21.706
But I don't think
you want to, either.

21:21.740 --> 21:24.345
(sighs)

21:25.550 --> 21:27.006
That's dirty, Eli.

21:27.050 --> 21:29.075
No. No, it's not.

21:29.120 --> 21:32.419
There is no political reason
to dump this candidate,

21:32.450 --> 21:35.988
and I will not pretend there is
to make things...

21:36.020 --> 21:37.988
emotionally easier.

21:38.030 --> 21:39.782
(sighs)

21:45.030 --> 21:47.294
How understanding of you.

21:49.370 --> 21:51.565
Jackie, I'm sorry, but...

21:51.610 --> 21:53.009
(door opens, closes)

21:53.040 --> 21:55.008
MAN:
All rise.

21:55.040 --> 21:57.907
Well, that injunction
didn't work.

21:57.950 --> 22:00.919
It appears so, Your Honor,
and as you can see,

22:00.950 --> 22:04.886
a new thread has popped up
that also disparages our client.

22:04.920 --> 22:06.547
Yes, that has a
way of happening.

22:06.590 --> 22:07.852
And as you can see,
Scabbit has again refused

22:07.890 --> 22:08.982
to appear in court.

22:09.020 --> 22:11.056
Uh, no. Uh, we
just got a message.

22:11.090 --> 22:13.558
They are on their way
with their new counsel.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.488
So, let's give them
a couple of moments.

22:15.530 --> 22:17.361
So, uh, how is it
going on your own?

22:17.400 --> 22:19.459
On my own?
Mm.

22:19.500 --> 22:22.469
Oh. My own law firm.
Mm.

22:22.500 --> 22:24.468
Bracing, Your Honor.

22:24.510 --> 22:26.569
I remember my first year
hanging the shingle.

22:26.610 --> 22:28.737
Oh, God, there's nothing
scarier in the world.

22:28.780 --> 22:30.099
Yes, Your Honor.
(door opens)

22:30.140 --> 22:31.573
Oh, here's your opposition.

22:31.610 --> 22:33.976
Hello, Your Honor.

22:34.020 --> 22:36.716
Will Gardner and Damian
Boyle here representing

22:36.750 --> 22:38.638
the interests of Scabbit.com.
KLUGER:
Will Gardner?

22:38.690 --> 22:40.749
Why is that...?

22:40.790 --> 22:42.451
Oh, yes.

22:42.490 --> 22:44.526
You two used to be on the
same side, didn't you?

22:44.560 --> 22:46.027
Yes, Your Honor.
Oh, well,

22:46.060 --> 22:47.618
that's awkward.

22:47.660 --> 22:49.651
Not at all, Your Honor.

22:54.070 --> 22:54.991
Scabbit has not adhered

22:55.040 --> 22:56.996
to the cease-and-desist order,
Your Honor.

22:57.040 --> 22:58.860
We have adhered, Your Honor.
As Mrs. Florrick is well aware,

22:58.910 --> 23:00.036
we've taken down the thread

23:00.070 --> 23:01.401
covered in the
original complaint.

23:01.440 --> 23:02.600
The thread has been renamed,

23:02.640 --> 23:03.902
not taken down.
May I approach?

23:03.950 --> 23:06.908
Oh, please.

23:06.950 --> 23:09.111
As you can see here,

23:09.150 --> 23:10.845
the deleted
"Milwaukee Bomber" thread

23:10.890 --> 23:13.654
has been renamed, "Who Bombed
the Milwaukee Festival?"

23:13.690 --> 23:15.715
WILL:
That is not a renaming.

23:15.760 --> 23:17.682
That is a spontaneous
expression of Scabbit's members.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.721
We took down the thread.
They introduced their own.

23:19.760 --> 23:21.557
DAMIAN:
We can control our actions,
Your Honor,

23:21.600 --> 23:22.919
but we can not
and should not

23:22.960 --> 23:25.064
control the actions
of our members.

23:25.100 --> 23:27.739
We are not asking them to
control anyone but themselves.

23:27.770 --> 23:30.864
We ask that they be forced
to take down this new thread...

23:30.910 --> 23:32.935
You know, I agree
with Mrs. Florrick.

23:32.970 --> 23:35.438
You guys-- you're
playing with semantics.

23:35.480 --> 23:36.333
You're not going to
the spirit of the law.

23:36.380 --> 23:38.143
We ask that they take down
this thread,

23:38.180 --> 23:39.943
Your Honor.
Sure.

23:39.980 --> 23:41.948
This is the CEO
of Scabbit.com.

23:41.980 --> 23:43.880
Uh, Mr. Essex, would
you do the honor?

23:43.920 --> 23:45.114
Yes.

23:45.150 --> 23:46.617
It's gone.

23:46.650 --> 23:47.753
The thread's gone.

23:47.790 --> 23:48.882
This is a game, uh...

23:48.920 --> 23:50.820
Your Honor,
may I approach the bench?

23:50.860 --> 23:52.452
Oh, come on down.
It's a party.

23:52.490 --> 23:54.094
This is a game
of Whac-A-Mole, Your Honor.

23:54.130 --> 23:55.222
There will be three

23:55.260 --> 23:57.820
mo_re threads
by this afternoon.
I have a question.

23:57.870 --> 23:59.861
Has anyone ever actually
played Whac-A-Mole?

23:59.900 --> 24:01.936
Or is it some metaphor
we use mindlessly?

24:01.970 --> 24:03.665
Oh, yes,
I have, Your Honor.

24:03.710 --> 24:05.234
Navy Pier.

24:05.270 --> 24:06.908
It's really good.
Uh-huh.

24:06.940 --> 24:08.771
Helps get out
your aggressions.
What's your name again?

24:08.810 --> 24:10.744
Damian Boyle.
In what part of Ireland?

24:10.780 --> 24:11.940
Oh, no, no.
The accent's fake.

24:11.980 --> 24:13.242
I'm from Queens.

24:13.280 --> 24:14.918
(laughs)
CARY:
The point is,

24:14.950 --> 24:15.917
Your Honor, we move

24:15.950 --> 24:18.145
that Scabbit honor
the spirit of your ruling

24:18.190 --> 24:19.817
by deleting threads
as they appear.

24:19.850 --> 24:22.080
How? I mean,
how-how-how do we do that?

24:22.120 --> 24:25.783
Scabbit employs moderators
who...

24:25.830 --> 24:26.956
KLUGER:
Yes, Mrs. Florrick?

24:26.990 --> 24:29.891
Uh, we-we just,
that, uh...

24:29.930 --> 24:32.626
Your Honor, we ask that
Chumhum-- excuse me--

24:32.670 --> 24:33.932
that Scabbit issue an edict

24:33.970 --> 24:36.734
to have those moderators
prohibit postings

24:36.770 --> 24:38.101
vilifying Zayeed Shaheed.

24:38.140 --> 24:39.869
WILL:
That is a prior
restraint, Your Honor.

24:39.910 --> 24:42.128
I'm surprised Mrs. Florrick and
Mr. Agos would even suggest it.

24:42.180 --> 24:43.329
Maybe that would
work for Chumhum...

24:43.380 --> 24:45.769
DAMIAN:
We are ready and able
to delete any threads

24:45.810 --> 24:47.914
ordered by the court,
but it is unconstitutional

24:47.950 --> 24:49.577
to restrain speech
beforehand.
ALICIA:
Your Honor,

24:49.620 --> 24:51.815
this is a game.
Yes. Whac-A-Mole.
We've been over this.

24:51.850 --> 24:54.580
We can't come in here
every time a new post appears.

24:54.620 --> 24:55.712
There's a new one.

24:55.760 --> 24:58.058
See? New thread's
up already.

24:58.090 --> 24:59.626
What's the title of it?

24:59.660 --> 25:01.594
"Milwaukee Bomber Part Two."

25:01.630 --> 25:03.769
Would the court
like it deleted?
Yes.

25:03.800 --> 25:05.995
Done.

25:06.030 --> 25:08.533
Your Honor...
this is ridiculous.
Yes.

25:08.570 --> 25:11.300
Unfortunately, it might be,
but it's the law.

25:11.340 --> 25:14.776
My cease-and-desist orders can
not cover future infractions,

25:14.810 --> 25:16.903
only current,
so, return with

25:16.940 --> 25:19.079
objections to threads
as they appear,

25:19.110 --> 25:21.169
and... I will rule.

25:21.220 --> 25:23.040
(bangs gavel)

25:23.080 --> 25:24.183
(crowd chatter)

25:24.220 --> 25:25.710
Where did you get that?

25:25.750 --> 25:27.217
What? Oh, oh,
this old thing.

25:27.250 --> 25:28.319
Oh, I don't know.

25:28.360 --> 25:29.657
Why? Do you like it?

25:29.690 --> 25:31.783
I liked it
when it was on my desk.

25:31.830 --> 25:32.979
Oh, you have one, too?

25:33.030 --> 25:34.895
You're the world's
number one mom?

25:34.930 --> 25:36.921
Well, I have me moments.

25:36.960 --> 25:40.020
CARY:
You took the furniture
from our offices.

25:40.070 --> 25:42.664
So, this is what it's come
down to-- high school pranks?

25:42.700 --> 25:46.966
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

25:47.010 --> 25:49.706
Oh, my God.

25:49.740 --> 25:51.947
(loud, overlapping chatter)

25:51.980 --> 25:55.143
I am calling for a vote
to rescind the partnership

25:55.180 --> 25:57.171
extended to Damian Boyle
by Will.

25:57.220 --> 25:59.142
Any debate?
I kind of like the guy.

25:59.190 --> 26:00.316
Yeah, I say

26:00.350 --> 26:02.352
we give him a chance.

26:02.390 --> 26:04.984
David, you're the one
who called for this vote.

26:05.030 --> 26:07.180
Yeah. I changed my mind.
HOWARD:
Me, too.

26:07.230 --> 26:10.051
And he brought us this Internet
thing. What's it called?

26:10.100 --> 26:11.192
Scabbit.
Yeah.

26:11.230 --> 26:12.822
And he's a
very funny guy.

26:12.870 --> 26:15.896
Howard, this is a law firm,
not Second City.

26:15.940 --> 26:19.637
If the motion is
to remove him, I'd vote no.

26:22.310 --> 26:24.744
Hey. You were looking for me?

26:28.820 --> 26:30.788
What do you think
of Damian?

26:30.820 --> 26:31.980
Mm, not much.

26:32.020 --> 26:33.317
Based on what?

26:33.350 --> 26:35.011
First impressions.

26:36.060 --> 26:37.948
Can you get me more than that?

26:37.990 --> 26:40.288
I can try. We didn't get
a chance to vet him.

26:40.330 --> 26:42.321
Vet him now.

26:46.170 --> 26:48.866
I sent Sondra to get
another card table.

26:48.900 --> 26:50.629
Who was that guy?
CARY:
Damian Boyle?

26:50.670 --> 26:52.308
Lockhart/Gardner's
new rainmaker.

26:52.340 --> 26:53.807
Brass knuckles type.

26:53.840 --> 26:55.273
Why would Lockhart/Gardner
represent Scabbit?

26:55.310 --> 26:57.949
There can't be
much money there.

26:57.980 --> 26:59.140
It's a double-bank shot.

26:59.180 --> 27:00.374
They want Chumhum

27:00.410 --> 27:02.219
to see us arguing
against Internet freedom.

27:02.250 --> 27:03.740
So they can pull Chumhum back.
Yup.

27:03.790 --> 27:05.849
Any leads on our furniture?
ROBYN:
Uh, no.

27:05.890 --> 27:07.141
The surveillance cameras
downstairs were broken.

27:07.190 --> 27:08.748
Oh.
(laughing)

27:08.790 --> 27:10.758
We're having new furniture
brought in this afternoon.

27:10.790 --> 27:13.088
CARY (sighs): You want to
get the cops involved?
Zayeed?

27:13.130 --> 27:14.222
What's wrong?

27:14.260 --> 27:15.727
I just got fired.

27:15.760 --> 27:17.819
What?!

27:17.870 --> 27:20.259
I went back to my office,
and security barred my door.

27:20.300 --> 27:21.892
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

27:21.940 --> 27:23.032
It's these threads.

27:23.070 --> 27:24.401
They're saying
incredible things.

27:24.440 --> 27:26.431
They say I was at a madrasa
in Afghanistan.

27:26.470 --> 27:29.303
They say I was
at a terrorist training camp.

27:30.810 --> 27:32.107
What?

27:32.150 --> 27:33.879
We've been going
at this wrong.

27:33.920 --> 27:35.774
In a piecemeal way.

27:35.820 --> 27:37.913
You have damages now.

27:39.420 --> 27:40.785
Defamation, Your Honor.

27:40.820 --> 27:42.151
Well, that's imaginative.

27:42.190 --> 27:44.454
You two do know
that I have other cases?

27:44.490 --> 27:46.754
We're asking for $400,000
in compensatory damages

27:46.790 --> 27:48.326
and $8 million
in punitive damages.

27:48.360 --> 27:49.452
Wow. $8 million.

27:49.500 --> 27:50.865
Why not $60?

27:50.900 --> 27:52.197
Our client lost his job

27:52.230 --> 27:54.061
and a lucrative book deal

27:54.100 --> 27:56.739
due to the reckless behavior
exhibited by Scabbit.

27:56.770 --> 27:58.306
DAMIAN:
There's no defamation.

27:58.340 --> 28:00.399
Section 230 of the
Communications Decency Act

28:00.440 --> 28:02.874
specifically exempts hosts
from the responsibility

28:02.910 --> 28:05.208
of postings for
their users.

28:05.250 --> 28:07.468
Right, you can't sue the city
for building sidewalks

28:07.510 --> 28:09.478
where protestors voice
their freedom of speech.

28:11.990 --> 28:14.151
of the Scabbit Web site.
You're fishing.
She's fishing, Your Honor.

28:14.190 --> 28:16.488
I wish I were,
but we have a witness.

28:16.520 --> 28:18.488
Goody.

28:18.530 --> 28:20.452
Grant Irvin.

28:20.490 --> 28:23.493
Scabbi_t screen name:
"Lotion my feet."

28:23.530 --> 28:24.963
"Lotion my feet"? Really?

28:25.000 --> 28:26.991
Yes. It's a joke.
Ah.

28:27.030 --> 28:28.497
ALICIA:
And how long have you

28:28.540 --> 28:30.758
been active on Scabbit,
Mr. Irvin?
From the beginning.

28:30.810 --> 28:32.960
The very beginning.
Hi, Darryl.

28:33.010 --> 28:35.001
In fact,
you're a Ground Floor Poster,

28:35.040 --> 28:37.008
Mr. Irvin. What does that mean?

28:37.040 --> 28:40.168
It means I'm... pretty cool,
pretty gansta.

28:40.210 --> 28:41.245
Oh, we are
happy for you.
(laughs)

28:41.280 --> 28:42.975
And, um,
this is your comment

28:43.020 --> 28:44.214
from two days ago?

28:44.250 --> 28:45.319
"Zayeed is a terrorist

28:45.350 --> 28:49.810
"trained in Pakistan
and sent to America undercover.

28:49.860 --> 28:51.122
Lotion my feet."?

28:51.160 --> 28:52.252
Yes. That's me.

28:52.290 --> 28:54.019
And how did you know this
about Zayeed?

28:54.060 --> 28:56.255
How did I know it?
I didn't. It's my opinion.

28:56.300 --> 28:58.268
Okay.

28:58.300 --> 29:00.393
Did you know
he was born in Detroit?

29:00.430 --> 29:01.533
IRVIN:
No.

29:01.570 --> 29:02.832
And isn't it true
that in addition

29:02.870 --> 29:04.064
to your Ground
Floor status,

29:04.110 --> 29:06.203
you are a moderator
on this site?
Yes.

29:06.240 --> 29:09.937
And as a moderator,
you monitor the topic threads,

29:09.980 --> 29:12.039
and shut down accounts
of abuswe users?

29:12.080 --> 29:14.913
Yes.
And does Scabbit
reward you for these efforts?

29:14.950 --> 29:17.339
Yeah. I have more Pimp
Points than any other user.

29:17.380 --> 29:18.813
Pimp Points?
What are those?

29:18.850 --> 29:21.080
Like Internet money.
It gets you more prestige.

29:21.120 --> 29:23.554
I have about as much influence
as the founders.

29:23.590 --> 29:26.320
Nothing further.

29:26.360 --> 29:28.453
So, you said, Pimp Points
are like Internet money?

29:28.500 --> 29:29.489
Explain that to me.

29:29.530 --> 29:33.864
Users with the most visited
threads are rewarded

29:33.900 --> 29:37.392
with online icons that
appear next to their names.

29:37.440 --> 29:38.464
Ah, I see.

29:38.510 --> 29:41.104
And can you use these
Pimp Points to buy things

29:41.140 --> 29:42.437
like food or clothing?

29:42.480 --> 29:44.175
No.

29:44.210 --> 29:46.508
Your Honor, quite simply,

29:46.550 --> 29:48.177
employees are compensated.

29:48.220 --> 29:50.176
Mr. Feet was never
compensated for his efforts.

29:50.220 --> 29:51.448
Employees are also
supervised, Your Honor.

29:51.490 --> 29:55.210
And we contend that the awarding
of points indicates supervision.

29:55.260 --> 29:56.909
Points can not be awarded

29:56.960 --> 29:59.383
if the moderators are not
tracked and supervised.

29:59.430 --> 30:01.193
Yes. That's a nice pivot.

30:01.230 --> 30:04.097
Supervision is enough to
establish employment as regards

30:04.130 --> 30:05.165
Section 230.

30:05.200 --> 30:07.361
Just a, few more
questions, Your Honor?
Go ahead.

30:07.400 --> 30:09.493
Mr. Irvin, do you...?
You can call
me "Mr. Feet."

30:09.540 --> 30:10.837
Uh, no, thanks.

30:10.870 --> 30:12.906
Were you contacted by Scabbit

30:12.940 --> 30:15.579
before receiving
your points and titles?

30:15.610 --> 30:17.942
By Scabbit? No.
Any supervisor
at Scabbit?

30:17.980 --> 30:19.004
No.

30:19.050 --> 30:21.439
In fact, do you know
how Pimp Points are awarded?

30:21.480 --> 30:23.209
Yeah. They're based
on algorithm.

30:23.250 --> 30:25.582
WILL:
Meaning, the computer
decided the compensation,

30:25.620 --> 30:27.542
not a human?
IRVIN:
Yes.

30:27.590 --> 30:29.285
It's like Words With
Friends rankings.

30:29.320 --> 30:32.187
You reach a goal,
and bam, here you go.

30:32.230 --> 30:33.481
No more questions.

30:33.530 --> 30:36.397
KLUGER:
Mrs. Florrick,
any thoughts?

30:39.430 --> 30:42.365
Not at this time.

30:46.670 --> 30:50.231
(laughter, crowd chatter)

30:50.280 --> 30:51.577
You should have
turned it down.

30:53.610 --> 30:55.419
Jackie, hello.

30:55.450 --> 30:57.418
I'm sorry. What was that?

30:57.450 --> 30:59.384
I said, you should have
turned it down.

30:59.420 --> 31:02.218
Now, it will be much more
embarrassing when you bow out.

31:02.260 --> 31:04.251
(sighs)

31:05.330 --> 31:07.651
Jackie, why don't you
call my office?

31:07.690 --> 31:10.523
We'll sit down and talk.

31:10.560 --> 31:12.664
No, thank you.

31:12.700 --> 31:14.998
If this is about
that... confusion...

31:15.040 --> 31:17.065
(laughs)

31:17.100 --> 31:19.409
Is that what it was-- confusion?

31:19.440 --> 31:21.101
What, where
to wear your panties?

31:21.140 --> 31:22.505
(sighs)

31:22.540 --> 31:24.371
That was a long time ago.

31:24.410 --> 31:26.105
I was 25.

31:26.150 --> 31:28.175
Yes. And you should have slept

31:28.220 --> 31:30.541
with a husband of someone
with a shorter memory.

31:30.580 --> 31:32.411
_It was nice _
seeing you, Jackie.

31:32.450 --> 31:34.281
But I'm not bowing out
of anything.

31:34.320 --> 31:36.311
Then I'll tell your husband.

31:38.230 --> 31:39.686
Tell my husband what?

31:39.730 --> 31:44.224
That you had sex
with my husband for two years

31:44.270 --> 31:46.261
after you were married.

31:48.140 --> 31:50.392
He's in the hospital
with cancer.

31:50.440 --> 31:53.000
That's too bad. It'll make it
that much harder for him.

31:53.040 --> 31:56.430
(sighs)
You are an awful women.

31:56.480 --> 31:58.505
Yes. I am.

31:58.550 --> 32:00.404
Bow out,
or I'll tell your husband.

32:00.450 --> 32:01.576
He already knows.

32:01.620 --> 32:02.712
(laughs)

32:02.750 --> 32:04.388
I don't believe you.
Too bad.

32:04.420 --> 32:06.615
Ronald and I don't keep
secrets from each other.

32:06.650 --> 32:08.459
He's known for years.

32:08.490 --> 32:10.378
So do your worst, Jackie.

32:12.560 --> 32:15.097
You were never important
to the judge.

32:18.630 --> 32:21.497
Excuse me, I have
to get to my lunch.

32:29.480 --> 32:30.606
Thanks for doing this.

32:30.640 --> 32:32.449
It should only take
a few minutes.

32:32.480 --> 32:33.572
Sure.

32:33.610 --> 32:35.578
And, uh, what is "this"?

32:35.620 --> 32:38.418
Um, it's the usual
employment questions.

32:38.450 --> 32:40.042
We like to keep this stuff

32:40.090 --> 32:41.557
on file.
Oh...

32:41.590 --> 32:43.285
You're the investigator.
Yes.

32:43.320 --> 32:45.459
Are you good?
(chuckles)
I am.

32:45.490 --> 32:48.129
_ I don't believe
in women investigators.

32:48.160 --> 32:49.297
You're just not...

32:49.330 --> 32:51.298
thorough enough.
Good.

32:51.330 --> 32:53.525
That will give me more time
to work with the other partners.

32:53.570 --> 32:54.992
Mmm.
(chuckles)

32:55.040 --> 32:56.132
Birthdate?

32:59.170 --> 33:01.309
May 5, 1971.

33:01.340 --> 33:04.207
November 3, 1972.

33:04.250 --> 33:07.708
And do you have a primary one?
Nah.

33:07.750 --> 33:09.638
How long have you been
in the states?

33:09.680 --> 33:11.341
15 years. How 'bout yourself?

33:11.390 --> 33:13.119
How long have you been
in private practice?
Eight years.

33:13.150 --> 33:14.378
Any family?
Yeah.

33:18.730 --> 33:20.049
Who are they?

33:21.100 --> 33:22.658
Five sisters in Dublin.

33:22.700 --> 33:24.258
Four married, one in school.

33:24.300 --> 33:26.029
My mother's in a home.
Father's dead.

33:26.070 --> 33:27.367
He left her when I was eight.

33:27.400 --> 33:28.492
I have authority issues.

33:30.440 --> 33:32.601
(chuckles)

33:32.640 --> 33:35.336
So, uh, you ever been arrested?

33:35.380 --> 33:37.803
(chuckles)
No comment.

33:37.840 --> 33:40.149
Hmm. Actually, that's, uh...
that's not a possibility.

33:40.180 --> 33:42.410
Actually, it has to be.
No, you don't
understand.

33:42.450 --> 33:44.418
I need an answer.
Or...?

33:44.450 --> 33:46.816
Or I will have to investigate.

33:46.850 --> 33:48.818
And that way
you won't get a chance

33:48.860 --> 33:50.782
to put your arrests
in perspective.

33:50.820 --> 33:52.788
(sniffs)

33:52.830 --> 33:54.798
(gqlps)
Yeah, fair enough.

33:54.830 --> 33:56.354
Um, last first or...

33:56.400 --> 33:58.095
If you want.
Yeah?

33:58.130 --> 34:00.496
Before we, um...
A few things,

34:00.530 --> 34:03.693
I feel like _I have
a better perspective on the law

34:03.740 --> 34:06.459
because I've seen
both sides of it.
Save the speech

34:06.510 --> 34:07.829
for Will and Diane.

34:07.870 --> 34:09.770
I just need the facts.

34:13.880 --> 34:15.518
Section 230 applies.

34:15.550 --> 34:17.575
Your supervision counters
a clever argument,

34:17.620 --> 34:20.316
but the reward system
is based on an algorithm.

34:20.350 --> 34:22.250
Therefore, Scabbit
posters cannot

34:22.290 --> 34:23.450
be classified as employees.

34:23.490 --> 34:25.788
So there's no defamation.
Your Honor,
we cannot be assured

34:25.830 --> 34:29.357
that the posters are not,
in fact, employees of Scabbit.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.766
We only have access
to their online user names.
Hold on.

34:31.800 --> 34:33.495
We ask
that Scabbit release

34:33.530 --> 34:36.090
the real names of the posters
involved in defaming my client.

34:36.140 --> 34:39.507
This is the only way
we can determine

34:39.540 --> 34:42.737
if the posters in question are
not actually Scabbit employees.

34:42.780 --> 34:44.441
Objection, Your Honor.

34:44.480 --> 34:46.209
This is a Mrs. Florrick ploy.

34:46.250 --> 34:47.740
Really?
Really. Revealing

34:47.780 --> 34:49.645
the identities of users
would destroy Scabbit.

34:49.680 --> 34:52.240
Still, it seems like
a-a fair request to me.

34:52.290 --> 34:55.657
I mean, your argument
is that the users

34:55.690 --> 34:57.749
who defamed her client
are not employees.

34:57.790 --> 34:59.223
Well, the only way
she can tell that

34:59.260 --> 35:01.797
is if she's given
the actual names

35:01.830 --> 35:04.321
of the users.
Can we ask for a gag order

35:04.370 --> 35:06.258
to protect the identities
of the posters?

35:06.300 --> 35:08.666
Absolutely. Come on.
Ask for anything you want.
Unlike Scabbit,

35:08.700 --> 35:10.839
_ we are not interested
in defaming innocent people.

35:10.870 --> 35:12.531
We just want
the truth.
Oh.

35:12.570 --> 35:14.674
Well, try to accept your victory
without gloating,

35:14.710 --> 35:16.439
Mrs. Florrick. Please
release the names

35:16.480 --> 35:17.504
to Florrick-Agos

35:17.540 --> 35:18.609
by the end
of the day.

35:18.650 --> 35:19.799
(gavelbangs)

35:19.850 --> 35:21.272
DIANE:
Damian?

35:21.320 --> 35:22.514
Yeah.

35:22.550 --> 35:23.915
He was pretty forthcoming.

35:23.950 --> 35:25.440
Well, that's surprising.
Yeah.

35:25.490 --> 35:27.583
He gave me three
different birthdays.

35:27.620 --> 35:29.383
Only three?
(chuckles)

35:29.420 --> 35:31.581
He did pass
the Illinois bar.

35:31.630 --> 35:33.928
And he was in a DUI.
a few months ago

35:33.960 --> 35:35.291
in which he hit
a streetlight.

35:35.330 --> 35:37.719
It's not on his record?
No. Police decided

35:37.760 --> 35:39.819
not to prosecute,
after he gave a donation

35:39.870 --> 35:41.394
to the Police Memorial Fund.

35:43.300 --> 35:45.803
Was the donation for $18,000?

35:45.840 --> 35:47.808
Yeah.

35:47.840 --> 35:51.378
Howard Lyman ran
into a streetlight

35:51.410 --> 35:54.538
and donated $18,000
to the Police Memorial Fund

35:54.580 --> 35:56.719
to avoid a DUI.
He's using Howard Lyman's

35:56.750 --> 35:58.411
indiscretion.
Yes.

35:58.450 --> 35:59.610
Okay.

35:59.650 --> 36:00.878
I'll find out more.

36:00.920 --> 36:03.252
This one's a little off,
isn't he?

36:03.290 --> 36:05.258
Yeah.

36:05.290 --> 36:07.326
Dangerous?
No.

36:07.360 --> 36:09.954
Just off.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.662
ROBYN:
Lockhart/Gardner dumped
180 names on us,

36:12.700 --> 36:14.338
and I cross-referenced them
with Scabbit employees

36:14.370 --> 36:15.564
and there were no hits.

36:15.600 --> 36:17.830
Damn, so...
what, we lost?

36:17.870 --> 36:20.930
Well, there was one poster,
Dante Pryor,

36:20.970 --> 36:23.336
who doesn't exist.
ALICIA:
Who? What does that mean?

36:23.380 --> 36:25.200
It means...

36:25.250 --> 36:27.275
I have no idea.

36:27.310 --> 36:29.778
But he's all over the
Web. His screen name

36:29.820 --> 36:33.642
is Chubbysock552. And he's
on Chumhum, Facebook, Twitter,

36:33.690 --> 36:34.884
Foursquare, but I can't find him

36:34.920 --> 36:36.410
through the DMV
or utility companies.

36:36.460 --> 36:37.518
Okay. So what do we do?

36:37.560 --> 36:39.653
ROBYN:
I have no idea.

36:39.690 --> 36:43.296
180 users defamed Zayeed.
179 I located, one I haven't.

36:43.330 --> 36:46.697
His name is Dante Pryor,
and he seems to be a ghost?

36:46.730 --> 36:48.732
(sighs)

36:48.770 --> 36:51.261
(zapping sounds)
(hisses)

36:51.310 --> 36:53.733
(eerie sci-fi music playing)

36:53.770 --> 36:55.533
(roars)

36:55.580 --> 36:57.536
(door opens)

36:57.580 --> 37:00.003
Jackie Florrick.
Ronald.

37:00.050 --> 37:02.018
I heard you were ill, and it...

37:02.050 --> 37:04.689
reminded me
of just how long it's been

37:04.720 --> 37:06.483
since we've seen each other.

37:06.520 --> 37:07.942
Yes. When you're
in the hospital,

37:07.990 --> 37:09.412
you find out who
your friends are.

37:09.460 --> 37:10.984
Yes, you do.

37:11.020 --> 37:12.681
And I brought you
flowers.

37:12.730 --> 37:15.290
Hey, Rach. Look who's here.

37:15.330 --> 37:16.888
You remember Jackie?

37:16.930 --> 37:18.363
(roar)

37:18.400 --> 37:20.368
(chuckles)
JACKIE:
Hi, Rachel.

37:20.400 --> 37:21.992
It's so good to see you.

37:28.610 --> 37:30.498
And how are you
feeling?

37:30.540 --> 37:33.043
Well, the diagnosis is not good.

37:33.080 --> 37:35.048
But the bright spot...

37:35.080 --> 37:36.877
is the way Rachel has stuck

37:36.920 --> 37:39.343
by my side.
Yes, she's very special.

37:39.390 --> 37:42.518
I remember when she worked
for the judge.

37:42.560 --> 37:44.858
He'd come home at night
and sing her praises...

37:44.890 --> 37:47.324
Jackie, why don't
we talk outside?

37:47.360 --> 37:48.850
Of course,
my dear.

37:48.900 --> 37:52.825
_ It's been a while
Since we've caught up as well.

37:52.870 --> 37:54.963
We'd like to call Dante Pryor
to the stand.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.833
Dante Pryor? Okay.
That's a name.

37:57.870 --> 37:59.804
Where is he?
ALICIA:
Well, that's what
we would like to know.

37:59.840 --> 38:00.807
We can't find him.

38:00.840 --> 38:02.933
Why did you call him?

38:02.980 --> 38:04.402
Dante Pryor is a Scabbit user

38:04.450 --> 38:06.975
who goes by the online name
of Chubbysock552.

38:07.010 --> 38:09.376
It's one of the names
that was released to us.
Why isn't he here?

38:09.420 --> 38:11.388
He's not human.

38:11.420 --> 38:12.819
He's a robot.

38:12.850 --> 38:14.408
Objection.
ALICIA:
Dante Pryor

38:14.460 --> 38:16.678
is a Socialbot,
created by Scabbit

38:16.720 --> 38:19.518
and released on their site
as Chubbysock552.
Your Honor,

38:19.560 --> 38:21.699
I have an objection. Relevance.
It's only relevant

38:21.730 --> 38:23.550
ifI can understand.

38:23.600 --> 38:25.465
Go on.
This Socialbot

38:25.500 --> 38:26.899
was designed
to appear human

38:26.930 --> 38:29.398
and drive traffic
from its Chumhum account

38:29.440 --> 38:30.759
and Twitter feed
to Scabbit.

38:30.800 --> 38:32.336
And it defamed your client?

38:32.370 --> 38:34.008
How could a robot
defame your client?

38:34.040 --> 38:37.976
It's designed to repackage
comments and gossip by others

38:38.010 --> 38:39.841
and disperse it onto sites

38:39.880 --> 38:43.338
so it can drive interested users
back to Scabbit.

38:43.380 --> 38:46.440
You Honor, a Socialbot
cannot defame...
"Zayeed Shaheed is

38:46.490 --> 38:48.879
"a guilty Muslim terrorist who
bombed the Milwaukee Festival.

38:48.920 --> 38:50.854
Chubbysock552."

38:50.890 --> 38:52.858
And-and that... all that
is from this Socialbot?

38:52.890 --> 38:55.097
Yes._ It's a _
computerized ver5ion

38:55.130 --> 38:57.018
of the worst part
of human nature.

38:57.060 --> 38:58.766
And it was built
by Scabbit.

38:58.800 --> 39:01.462
Therefore, Scabbit
is responsible.

39:01.500 --> 39:02.637
(inhales)

39:02.670 --> 39:03.932
Any thoughts?

39:05.140 --> 39:07.768
Your Honor, we'd like a recess
to confer with our client.

39:07.810 --> 39:09.630
Go for it.
(gavelbangs)

39:24.120 --> 39:27.453
Huh. This is different.

39:27.490 --> 39:29.890
DIANE:
Well, on the bright side,

39:29.930 --> 39:32.125
we weren't shot by
the crack dealers on the corner.

39:32.170 --> 39:33.694
(chuckles)

39:33.730 --> 39:34.731
Hello?

39:41.740 --> 39:43.901
What?

39:43.940 --> 39:45.646
The spartan look,

39:45.680 --> 39:47.875
the neighborhood--

39:47.910 --> 39:49.741
reminds me of us starting out.

39:49.780 --> 39:52.146
This wasn't anything like us.

39:52.190 --> 39:54.511
Yes, it is.

39:54.560 --> 39:57.188
Do you miss it?

39:57.220 --> 39:59.154
I don't know.

39:59.190 --> 40:02.023
(siren wailing outside)

40:02.060 --> 40:04.893
Hello?

40:04.930 --> 40:06.727
KALIN DA:
Cutting out early?

40:06.770 --> 40:09.989
Yeah. This is generally the time
I wire my ill-gotten gains

40:10.040 --> 40:11.905
to my account in the Caymans.

40:11.940 --> 40:13.202
What do you need?

40:13.240 --> 40:15.208
Just a small clarification.

40:15.240 --> 40:18.801
It appears you never had any
student loans from law school.

40:18.850 --> 40:20.044
(sniffs)
How'd you
pay for it?

40:20.080 --> 40:21.206
Me parents.

40:21.250 --> 40:22.808
They owned the one
movie theater in town,

40:22.850 --> 40:24.215
sold it so I could
cover my thon.

40:24.250 --> 40:26.582
You said your father left you
when you were eight.

40:28.190 --> 40:29.885
Me ma.

40:29.920 --> 40:31.888
She owned_ the one movie theater
in our town,

40:31.930 --> 40:33.522
sold it so I could cover
my tUItion...

40:33.560 --> 40:35.858
What game are you playing,
Mr. Boyle?
(sighs) You got me

40:35.900 --> 40:38.494
all wrong, Kalinda.
I'm not the game-playing type.

40:38.530 --> 40:39.895
I might be a fun-loving type.

40:39.930 --> 40:41.636
But games?

40:41.670 --> 40:42.830
No.

40:42.870 --> 40:44.508
Too much energy.

40:44.540 --> 40:47.134
Then why don't you
just come clean? Hmm?

40:47.170 --> 40:49.138
You know, sooner or later,

40:49.180 --> 40:51.068
I'll find out
what I need to know.

40:51.110 --> 40:53.249
(elevator dings)
Great.

40:53.280 --> 40:54.747
Come at me.

40:56.650 --> 40:59.539
I'm here.

41:00.990 --> 41:02.958
ELI:
Rachel, I admit
I'm disappointed,

41:02.990 --> 41:04.855
but I understand.

41:04.890 --> 41:06.687
Thank you for calling.

41:06.730 --> 41:07.822
(beep)

41:07.860 --> 41:08.952
Jackie.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.194
Yes, Mr. Gold?

41:10.230 --> 41:12.790
Rachel Keyser has dropped out
as Supreme Court candidate.

41:12.830 --> 41:14.798
Oh, that's certainly
unfortunate.

41:14.840 --> 41:16.535
But I'm not at all surprised.

41:16.570 --> 41:17.935
Why is that?

41:17.970 --> 41:19.835
Well, I heard
her husband was ill.

41:19.870 --> 41:22.930
I'm sure she wanted
to devote time to his care.

41:22.980 --> 41:25.574
That's the only reason?

41:25.610 --> 41:26.941
What else
could it be?

41:26.980 --> 41:27.947
You.

41:27.980 --> 41:29.049
Me?

41:29.080 --> 41:30.638
(chuckling):
No.

41:30.680 --> 41:32.887
I-I'm here to decorate

41:32.920 --> 41:34.888
Peter's office.
That's all.

41:34.920 --> 41:36.615
Jackie.

41:36.660 --> 41:38.287
You can't do this.

41:38.320 --> 41:40.754
Do what?

41:40.790 --> 41:43.953
Rachel has always done
what's best for Rachel.

41:45.870 --> 41:47.098
Well,

41:47.130 --> 41:49.189
it's always nice chatting
with you, Mr. Gold,

41:49.240 --> 41:52.664
but, um, I have
to find a place for this.

41:52.710 --> 41:54.678
Artwork. Party planning.

41:54.710 --> 41:56.701
You know, my domain.

42:01.650 --> 42:04.141
$830,000. That's
our final offer.

42:04.180 --> 42:06.045
We used to work for you.

42:06.090 --> 42:08.786
There are always three offers
before the final offer.

42:08.820 --> 42:11.050
You shouldn't overestimate
our gener05ity.

42:11.090 --> 42:13.058
And you shouldn't
underestimate how great it is

42:13.090 --> 42:14.921
to watch you
scrambling.

42:14.960 --> 42:16.598
'Cause you know
you lost.
So why don't

42:16.630 --> 42:18.120
we skip the next half
hour of gymnastics

42:18.160 --> 42:19.718
and get right to
the $1.5 million

42:19.770 --> 42:21.931
you have been
authorized to offer.

42:21.970 --> 42:23.665
SONDRA:
Mrs. Florrick,
you have a call.

42:23.700 --> 42:24.928
Take a message.

42:24.970 --> 42:26.608
I think you're gonna
want to talk to him.

42:29.110 --> 42:30.338
(beep)

42:30.380 --> 42:32.143
This is Alicia Florrick.

42:32.180 --> 42:33.272
KLUGER:
Oh, there you are.

42:33.310 --> 42:35.016
Hello to you, Mrs. Florrick.

42:35.050 --> 42:36.779
This is George Kluger.

42:36.820 --> 42:38.913
ALICIA:
George...?
G... (sighs)

42:38.950 --> 42:41.680
Otherwise known to you as
Judge Kluger the Magnificent.

42:41.720 --> 42:42.687
Ah,

42:42.720 --> 42:44.119
yes, of course, Your Honor.

42:44.160 --> 42:45.718
Is everything all right?

42:45.760 --> 42:48.149
Oh, oh, yes. Everything is just,
uh, fine, thank you.

42:48.190 --> 42:50.897
Uh, Mrs. Florrick, please don't
take this the wrong way,

42:50.930 --> 42:53.819
but I was wondering if you
would like to get some coffee?

42:56.140 --> 42:57.869
Excuse me?
