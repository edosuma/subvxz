finally came out of the closet?

19:21.630 --> 19:24.464
What I discovered during my
journey into the world of fiction,

19:24.483 --> 19:27.410
one, there was no point
in hoping for a do-over,

19:27.460 --> 19:29.857
because sometimes, they
suck more than the reality,

19:29.875 --> 19:32.409
two, I did not want to write fiction,

19:32.584 --> 19:35.099
three, I couldn't write fiction,

19:35.219 --> 19:38.746
and four, I couldn't write
the facts with an audience.

19:38.935 --> 19:41.393
So when it came to the
boys, I had no regret.

19:41.800 --> 19:43.821
If I hadn't trusted my instincts,

19:43.878 --> 19:48.589
I would have missed out on some amazing,
and incredibly painful experiences.

19:48.626 --> 19:51.292
Experiences that made me who I am.

19:51.336 --> 19:53.426
Who paved the way for who I'd be.

19:53.714 --> 19:56.560
Good, bad or ugly, I was
going to go with my gut,

19:56.680 --> 19:58.587
if a do-over wasn't an option

19:58.593 --> 20:00.264
maybe a start over was.

20:00.445 --> 20:02.835
And I finally knew who it would be with.

20:03.267 --> 20:05.426
But why was I telling the public at large?

20:05.651 --> 20:07.534
It should be private.

Next on Awkward...

20:20.923 --> 20:23.932
Spin the bottle, it was a
wreck of a rite of passage.

20:24.052 --> 20:25.797
The bottle didn't know what I wanted,

20:25.828 --> 20:26.992
but I did.

20:27.042 --> 20:30.590
Remember, all good things in my life,
are closely followed by something bad.

20:30.593 --> 20:33.339
The other shoe is poised
to drop at any moment.

20:33.340 --> 20:35.172
Surprise!

20:35.173 --> 20:36.587
Ever heard of knock?!
