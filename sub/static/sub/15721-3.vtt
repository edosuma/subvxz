I want you to remind Riddlemeyer
that his only priority is to find Bob.

00:03.866 --> 00:06.760
That's the deal we made.
That's why his ass isn't in jail.

00:07.225 --> 00:08.403
We made a mistake.

00:08.523 --> 00:12.364
- We moved past animal trials weeks ago.
- We have to go back, Mr. Roth.

00:12.484 --> 00:15.977
So, other than some mild headaches,
you're certain Dr. Melnikov'll be fine?

00:16.137 --> 00:19.272
- Probably anxious about his condition.
- To be expected.

00:19.432 --> 00:22.901
- Giving us a window of 2 to 3 months.
- That's all the time I need.

00:23.516 --> 00:24.694
Take care, my friend.

00:26.659 --> 00:27.550
Thanks.

00:29.146 --> 00:30.575
You're getting good at this.

00:30.735 --> 00:33.161
- I need Rachel. Where the hell is she?
- I don't know.

00:34.364 --> 00:35.580
He was operated on.

00:36.818 --> 00:38.500
On his brain? Why?

00:39.373 --> 00:40.787
Hi, David.

00:42.828 --> 00:43.755
Hi, Bob.

00:44.300 --> 00:47.745
- What did he have you doing?
- I can't remember, David.

00:47.865 --> 00:50.553
I'd like
to introduce you to Olivier Roth.

00:50.825 --> 00:52.889
- Dr. Sandström.
- Son of a bitch! What did you do?

00:54.351 --> 00:56.184
I am not the enemy here,

00:56.344 --> 00:57.421
Dr. Sandström.

His MRI looks fine,

01:30.536 --> 01:32.762
swelling is way down, and blood's good.

01:33.166 --> 01:35.640
- The Propofol is gone from his system?
- Completely.

01:35.946 --> 01:37.559
He does not have any side effects.

01:37.719 --> 01:40.979
- He can't remember the last 3 months...
- Not because of the coma we induced.

01:41.139 --> 01:43.606
More likely trauma complications
from the infection...

01:43.766 --> 01:46.276
Or the fact
that somebody did surgery on his brain?

01:46.780 --> 01:47.752
Could be.

01:48.419 --> 01:50.530
And he could fully recover his memories

01:50.690 --> 01:52.782
- if you work with him.
- Alright.

01:53.222 --> 01:54.416
Thanks, Doctor.

01:56.195 --> 01:58.660
- I like your book so far.
- Thank you.

02:02.451 --> 02:03.882
Who came up with that title?

02:04.002 --> 02:06.284
- It's just... get back to...
- Wait.

02:14.064 --> 02:15.099
What is it?

02:16.795 --> 02:18.330
I don't remember, David.

02:19.757 --> 02:21.396
Alright. What about names?

02:21.516 --> 02:24.195
- Jim? Dennis? Elvis?
- Hi, Bob!

02:25.827 --> 02:27.275
- Grey.
- What?

02:27.435 --> 02:28.883
What about Grey?

02:33.258 --> 02:35.450
The walls of Roth's lab were grey.

02:36.246 --> 02:39.037
Okay. There you go.
We got grey walls. Anything else?

02:55.313 --> 02:57.202
I was running from something.

03:01.369 --> 03:02.883
And I was scared.

04:44.671 --> 04:46.451
So when is he coming back
to work?

04:46.739 --> 04:48.748
Doctor says he should rest
a couple more days.

04:48.909 --> 04:50.460
He's going to stay with David.

04:50.620 --> 04:52.831
But he's gonna be alright, right?

04:53.287 --> 04:54.772
David says he's sharp as ever,

04:54.892 --> 04:57.216
but emotionally he's got some issues.

04:57.376 --> 04:59.343
If I couldn't remember
the last 3 months,

05:00.974 --> 05:02.763
I'd have emotional issues too.

05:04.405 --> 05:06.799
You sure you don't wanna grab
something to eat?

05:07.498 --> 05:09.407
No, I don't think so.

05:09.527 --> 05:11.968
Why don't you come on in
and help out for a while?

05:12.088 --> 05:14.196
You know,
atone for your sins.

05:39.495 --> 05:41.609
- I do volunteer work here.
- Okay.

05:44.467 --> 05:46.765
- Hey there.
- It's not good, Rachel.

05:59.110 --> 06:00.154
Oh, my God.

06:00.981 --> 06:01.828
Rachel.

06:02.371 --> 06:03.461
You hear about it?

06:03.581 --> 06:05.743
- What the hell is going on?
- They're dead.

06:06.304 --> 06:07.381
Four of 'em.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.163
- Just didn't wake up.
- What happened?

06:09.323 --> 06:10.331
They just died.

06:13.466 --> 06:14.665
That's Paulie.

06:21.293 --> 06:23.135
He used to come in here
for clean needles.

06:23.295 --> 06:25.313
- Think he OD'd?
- I don't know that.

06:25.433 --> 06:28.038
Jaundice sure says liver failure,
though.

06:32.293 --> 06:33.229
That's Jenny.

06:34.765 --> 06:35.731
Jenny?

06:42.314 --> 06:44.073
She was just fine a week ago.

06:45.609 --> 06:46.874
So was Paulie.

06:47.357 --> 06:50.246
- It's just not natural.
- Do you have an idea how this happened?

06:50.667 --> 06:54.667
- Word is we're not the only shelter.
- You're kidding! What have you heard?

06:55.142 --> 06:58.765
They're sayin' it's all over Toronto.
Some kind of epidemic.

06:59.034 --> 07:01.298
It's almost like
God's trying to get rid of us.

07:02.972 --> 07:05.468
I don't think
anybody's trying to get rid of you.

07:05.588 --> 07:09.342
Let's go see if the city's here.
We gotta close this place down.

07:12.286 --> 07:13.563
- You okay?
- Yeah.

07:13.683 --> 07:14.512
Good.

07:15.212 --> 07:16.824
Are you Department of Health?

07:16.944 --> 07:19.574
- Yes.
- I'm Rachel Wood, I'm with NorBAC.

07:19.694 --> 07:22.194
This is our Director of Operations,
Weston Field.

07:22.526 --> 07:23.690
Who called you in?

07:24.070 --> 07:26.240
Actually it's my day off.
I volunteer here.

07:27.316 --> 07:29.464
- I'm Dr. Martin Cove.
- Nice to meet you.

07:29.584 --> 07:30.786
So what's going on?

07:30.946 --> 07:34.331
We've had multiple cases of intravenous
drug users dying of liver failure.

07:34.491 --> 07:37.204
- Just in the shelters?
- No. All over the city.

07:37.324 --> 07:39.525
Cabbagetown. Yorkville. Harbourfront.

07:39.645 --> 07:42.339
So what are we thinking?
Bad drugs? Hepatitis?

07:42.499 --> 07:45.319
We should know that after we get a look
at their blood. That's what we're doing.

07:45.439 --> 07:47.099
- Dr. Cove, we're ready.
- Alright.

07:47.219 --> 07:49.014
- We have people at each door?
- We do.

07:49.134 --> 07:49.972
Excuse me.

07:51.222 --> 07:53.425
May I have your attention, please?

07:53.545 --> 07:54.705
Quiet down.

07:56.230 --> 07:58.611
We are experiencing
an outbreak of an unknown nature.

07:58.731 --> 08:00.288
You are all potentially at risk.

08:00.408 --> 08:04.111
Therefore you'll all need to be tested
before anyone leaves this building.

08:04.271 --> 08:08.361
Which is now, by order of the Department
of Public Health, under quarantine.

08:09.151 --> 08:10.299
Thank you.

08:15.569 --> 08:19.041
You must know some of the people here.
Would you mind lending us a hand?

08:19.161 --> 08:20.628
Sure, whatever you'd like.

08:20.788 --> 08:21.812
Thank you.

08:27.494 --> 08:28.994
Hi, I'm Megan.

08:30.163 --> 08:32.529
Just here for breakfast. I'll pass.

08:32.649 --> 08:33.510
She knows,

08:33.630 --> 08:36.370
everybody knows, I've been clean
for 6 weeks and I never shared needles.

08:36.490 --> 08:38.756
That's right.
But if it's hepatitis, you can get it.

08:38.876 --> 08:41.379
I was tested a month ago, okay?
I'm clean.

08:41.499 --> 08:44.498
Yeah, but tattoos,
or sharing razor blades, or...

08:45.171 --> 08:46.056
Sex.

08:46.332 --> 08:48.489
I've had one partner
in the last 5 years.

08:48.649 --> 08:50.532
I know, but it's very serious.

08:50.692 --> 08:52.618
I don't think
you should be taking any chances.

08:52.778 --> 08:54.394
I appreciate it, Rachel.

08:54.514 --> 08:56.956
I just don't want nobody stickin' me.

08:57.444 --> 08:59.577
But you have been
an intravenous drug user?

08:59.697 --> 09:01.877
- Not anymore.
- But you still need to be tested.

09:02.037 --> 09:04.975
You know why? 'Cause sometimes
this stuff stays dormant, right?

09:05.095 --> 09:06.547
- Okay.
- Yep.

09:08.710 --> 09:10.026
I'll do that.

09:10.146 --> 09:12.221
I'm afraid that I can't let you do that.

09:12.381 --> 09:15.266
- You'll never find a vein.
- I can't let you do it on your own.

09:15.426 --> 09:18.435
- I don't want you poking me!
- Trust me, I've got plenty of practice.

09:23.296 --> 09:24.308
Was it clean?

09:24.428 --> 09:26.610
- Absolutely, It didn't break the skin.
- Sure?

09:26.856 --> 09:29.739
- 100 percent sure.
- I'm sorry, I just didn't wanna...

09:30.171 --> 09:33.367
No, no, it's okay. It's alright, Glenn.
It's okay now.

09:34.245 --> 09:36.578
- What's going on?
- Nothing. We're okay.

09:37.520 --> 09:39.650
- Did you get his blood yet?
- No.

09:40.075 --> 09:40.925
Sir?

09:43.514 --> 09:46.130
Now, we can do this the hard way
or we can do this my way.

09:47.115 --> 09:49.591
I've looked at over a dozen dead bodies
in the last 6 hours...

09:49.751 --> 09:51.282
all intravenous drug users.

09:51.452 --> 09:53.942
- I don't do...
- At one time or another.

09:55.584 --> 09:56.932
Now please, sir.

09:57.092 --> 09:59.560
I'm only trying to help you,
possibly even save your life.

10:01.320 --> 10:03.230
Appreciate a little cooperation.

10:04.521 --> 10:05.566
Come on, Glenn.

10:06.062 --> 10:08.310
Two minutes and I'll buy you a burger.

10:12.700 --> 10:14.575
Only reason I'm doing this,
is because of her.

10:15.577 --> 10:16.529
Thank you.

10:30.584 --> 10:31.797
- Rachel.
- Yeah.

10:31.967 --> 10:33.802
I ran the ELISA analysis on the blood.

10:34.012 --> 10:35.143
It's Hepatitis C.

10:35.263 --> 10:37.556
Heavy viral load, consistent
with acute infection.

10:37.889 --> 10:39.641
But you need to take a look at this.

10:39.801 --> 10:42.201
- Why so many new cases?
- I don't know.

10:42.321 --> 10:44.849
Hep C rarely damages
the liver this badly.

10:44.969 --> 10:48.026
It usually causes more
of a long-term chronic infection.

10:48.435 --> 10:51.937
But this Hep C strain is looking
more and more interesting.

10:52.147 --> 10:56.125
This is the patient's blood yesterday.
I wanted to double-check the results.

10:56.245 --> 10:57.539
I took another sample.

10:57.659 --> 11:00.925
The same patient's blood,
less than 24 hours later.

11:01.045 --> 11:04.041
I know the Hep C virus
replicates like crazy, but...

11:04.568 --> 11:07.711
- 1,000 times in 24 hours?
- It's exactly what I thought. So...

11:07.871 --> 11:10.230
I checked the control experiments.
Everything looks fine.

11:10.350 --> 11:11.702
RNA tests confirmed it.

11:12.068 --> 11:15.302
- We should get David's head around.
- Get my head around what?

11:15.670 --> 11:18.320
Hey! I thought you weren't back
until tomorrow!

11:18.440 --> 11:20.724
Yeah, Bob clubbed a nurse
and made a break for it.

11:20.884 --> 11:22.226
That's not funny, David.

11:22.386 --> 11:24.959
- Welcome back, stranger.
- Hello, Rachel.

11:26.220 --> 11:28.368
Sorry I didn't let you know
where I was...

11:28.488 --> 11:31.208
- Welcome back.
- Hey, Carlos. It's good to be back.

11:31.471 --> 11:34.932
- Sorry I didn't let you know where I...
- Bob, enough with the "sorries," okay?

11:35.052 --> 11:35.850
Sorry.

11:39.695 --> 11:40.859
Gimme a minute.

11:41.130 --> 11:42.079
Excuse me.

11:42.967 --> 11:45.389
David, I'm feeling fine.
I just wanna get back to work.

11:45.509 --> 11:48.126
Couple more days of rest, Bob.
It's either my place or the hospital.

11:49.286 --> 11:50.773
Oh, my God, Bob! Hey!

11:58.542 --> 12:00.639
- I don't know why I did that.
- It's okay.

12:00.992 --> 12:02.224
I'm sorry. I...

12:02.889 --> 12:05.269
- I'm glad to see you too.
- I just got confused.

12:05.429 --> 12:06.972
Can I leave you two alone?

12:07.284 --> 12:08.084
Yeah.

12:16.484 --> 12:18.262
- I missed you too.
- Oh, God.

12:19.602 --> 12:23.510
Oh God, the last time I saw you,
you had me pretty freaked out, Bob.

12:25.694 --> 12:27.165
I seem to have adjusted.

12:28.484 --> 12:30.002
I'm OK now. I'm...

12:30.663 --> 12:32.546
able to control my feelings.

12:32.706 --> 12:34.965
- Really?
- Most of the time.

12:36.139 --> 12:37.800
But the last 3 months are in pieces.

12:38.923 --> 12:41.138
Just now, you know, before,
when I kissed you...

12:41.298 --> 12:42.795
Bob, don't worry about it.

12:43.178 --> 12:45.257
You were a piece of the puzzle...

12:47.522 --> 12:49.020
But I don't know what.

12:51.175 --> 12:53.998
We'll just have to start putting it
all together then.

12:55.923 --> 12:57.112
Thank you, Mayko.

13:01.612 --> 13:04.244
- So, what's been going on?
- Mayko!

13:04.812 --> 13:07.631
Get Carlos and Rachel.
Conference room in 5 minutes.

13:07.801 --> 13:09.180
Just a lot of that.

13:11.547 --> 13:12.450
Grumpy.

13:20.359 --> 13:22.898
- I don't know why I did that.
- It's okay.

13:23.018 --> 13:24.430
I'm sorry. I...

13:24.550 --> 13:27.642
- Hey, I'm glad to see you too.
- I just got confused.

13:27.802 --> 13:29.547
Can I leave you two alone?

13:29.667 --> 13:30.550
Yeah.

13:42.660 --> 13:43.991
I want Roth.

13:44.327 --> 13:45.324
Good luck.

13:45.668 --> 13:47.676
You gotta find him, Wes.
I need some answers.

13:47.796 --> 13:50.452
- To?
- For a start, what he did to Bob.

13:50.572 --> 13:52.407
Why didn't you ask
when you had the chance?

13:52.527 --> 13:55.837
'Cause I didn't realize Bob was going
to have a huge hole in his memory.

13:56.319 --> 13:58.643
Roth is not an easy guy to find, David.

14:00.153 --> 14:02.990
However Riddlemeyer has been spinning
the guy lately,

14:03.110 --> 14:05.811
we know for a fact
that Roth has been the money

14:05.931 --> 14:08.182
behind some very questionable research.

14:08.302 --> 14:10.907
And he's got a really
interesting philosophy

14:11.027 --> 14:13.063
about how the human race
should conduct itself.

14:13.223 --> 14:16.483
Now, he was doing something
in a secret lab for 3 months,

14:16.643 --> 14:20.113
doing something with Bob, and Bob can't
fucking remember anything about it!

14:20.233 --> 14:22.074
Doesn't that just bug the shit
out of you?

14:22.194 --> 14:24.241
- I'll make some calls.
- Thank you.

14:24.401 --> 14:27.661
CDC called. They want to know if we need
them on this hepatitis outbreak.

14:27.973 --> 14:29.246
What hepatitis outbreak?

14:30.527 --> 14:31.730
Weston Field.

14:35.936 --> 14:36.837
Mayko!

14:36.997 --> 14:40.006
Get Carlos and Rachel.
Conference room in 5 minutes.

14:40.802 --> 14:42.926
And this is as of 9 AM this morning.

14:43.932 --> 14:46.346
- How many are we talking about?
- 22 dead.

14:46.466 --> 14:48.092
- All from liver failure?
- Yeah.

14:48.212 --> 14:50.853
40 patients were administered
to emergency hospitals

14:50.973 --> 14:55.140
with severe hepatitis symptoms: fatigue,
mental disorientation, jaundice.

14:55.694 --> 14:57.148
All with acute Hepatitis C.

14:57.459 --> 14:59.840
People walk in sick and within days,
their liver gives out.

14:59.960 --> 15:02.689
And we can confirm everyone's
an intravenous drug user.

15:03.726 --> 15:05.976
I thought the city had
a needle exchange program?

15:06.096 --> 15:09.661
They do, but a clean needle isn't
exactly a priority with most addicts.

15:10.627 --> 15:14.334
Okay, so... did an existing Hep C
suddenly go into overdrive

15:14.454 --> 15:16.876
or are we dealing with something
we've never seen before?

15:17.521 --> 15:21.631
Maybe that's a question for Dr. Cove
over at the Toronto Division of Health.

15:22.682 --> 15:23.741
After you.

15:30.717 --> 15:32.649
Looks like they have
a well-equipped lab.

15:32.769 --> 15:34.695
Culture hood, bioreactor-wow.

15:34.815 --> 15:36.890
That's not what I'm talking about.

15:38.725 --> 15:39.765
Excuse me.

15:39.885 --> 15:41.309
Hi, I'm David.

15:41.429 --> 15:43.236
Megan. Can I help you?

15:44.315 --> 15:46.058
Oh, hi. How are you?

15:46.178 --> 15:48.491
Good, good. My colleague, Dr. Sandström.

15:49.061 --> 15:50.618
You're looking for Dr. Cove.

15:50.999 --> 15:53.330
I'm not sure he's here.
His station's over there.

15:53.490 --> 15:55.707
Megan,
you work at the Division of Health long?

15:55.867 --> 15:57.083
A year and a half.

15:57.447 --> 15:58.668
Got a favourite virus?

15:59.192 --> 16:01.129
I'm kind of playing the field right now.

16:01.289 --> 16:04.299
Megan, we've got 3 reported deaths
at the West side shelter.

16:04.946 --> 16:07.177
- We need to get over there.
- Right away. Excuse me.

16:07.674 --> 16:09.471
They've got you on the run these days.

16:09.631 --> 16:11.848
Up to 25 dead in the last week.

16:12.517 --> 16:13.690
What brings you here?

16:13.810 --> 16:15.646
David Sandström,
chief scientist at NorBAC.

16:15.766 --> 16:17.854
Looks like we're sticking our nose
into this.

16:18.733 --> 16:21.760
I'm glad to have you on board, Doctor,
because after 20 years

16:21.880 --> 16:24.903
of being a specialist in hepatitis,
I've never seen anything like this.

16:25.273 --> 16:27.734
You mind if we get up to speed,
see what you've got?

16:27.854 --> 16:30.218
What I've got
is an unidentified Hep C strain.

16:30.688 --> 16:32.619
Very little luck with treatments.

16:34.360 --> 16:35.883
And now 26 dead.

16:36.283 --> 16:38.958
Megan, I want you to gather
all our data for these folks.

16:39.260 --> 16:40.479
I'll do this myself.

16:40.912 --> 16:44.130
- Hate to be rude, but...
- No. Thank you for your time.

16:48.705 --> 16:50.630
He always this hands-on?

16:51.047 --> 16:52.787
I'd call it more of an obsession.

16:54.006 --> 16:56.584
I guess his daughter died
from using a dirty needle.

16:56.704 --> 16:59.009
I'm not exactly sure,
it was before I got here.

16:59.315 --> 17:01.542
Since then
he's been personally responsible

17:01.662 --> 17:04.233
for tripling the number
of needle exchange sites.

17:04.680 --> 17:07.945
And got the city to increase blood tests
for HIV, HCV...

17:08.106 --> 17:10.573
Wow... working on that cure
in his spare time, I bet.

17:10.733 --> 17:12.117
I wouldn't be surprised.

17:12.738 --> 17:15.722
This is my email.
Do you mind sending me those files?

17:15.842 --> 17:16.871
- Sure.
- Great.

17:22.012 --> 17:22.877
Oh... Mimi.

17:24.006 --> 17:25.630
- It's Megan.
- No, <i>Mimi.</i>

17:26.118 --> 17:27.557
Biggest virus known to man.

17:27.676 --> 17:29.670
Call me sometime,
I'll show you pictures.

17:32.013 --> 17:33.021
So sorry.

17:57.449 --> 17:58.340
Gee...

17:59.840 --> 18:02.113
Whoever you are, I love you.

18:02.792 --> 18:04.035
Whoever you are?

18:05.066 --> 18:08.253
- What are you still doing here?
- I was going to ask the same question.

18:09.751 --> 18:12.093
I'm trying to sort through this data
from Public Health.

18:13.266 --> 18:16.139
- Anything useful?
- No, not really.

18:16.909 --> 18:18.785
Wanna go get a cup of coffee?

18:20.015 --> 18:22.171
I think I might be wired enough.

18:24.902 --> 18:26.636
So what's the plan, then?

18:26.976 --> 18:28.484
Oh, that feels good.

18:29.298 --> 18:31.112
The plan is...

18:31.272 --> 18:35.742
that Mayko is coordinating
with the University of Washington

18:36.261 --> 18:37.831
and Rockefeller...

18:38.183 --> 18:38.953
And...

18:41.566 --> 18:44.871
So the first thing
we have to figure out is...

18:45.726 --> 18:46.919
That's so nice.

18:50.261 --> 18:51.668
What strain it is...

18:52.218 --> 18:53.952
and where it's from.

18:58.892 --> 19:01.751
Oh, Mr. Field, what nice hands you have.

19:25.449 --> 19:26.949
If I leave now,

19:27.570 --> 19:29.164
everything we've done...

19:32.094 --> 19:33.570
It's just too soon.

19:34.390 --> 19:36.640
If we wait... one more week...

19:37.062 --> 19:38.444
it'll all be over.

19:40.202 --> 19:41.468
I know it will...

19:43.062 --> 19:44.116
I promise.

20:17.943 --> 20:19.396
Bob? You alright?

20:24.485 --> 20:25.643
I was in bed.

20:25.861 --> 20:26.665
Yeah.

20:29.193 --> 20:31.350
- With a woman.
- No shit?

20:33.936 --> 20:36.445
This is good, Bob.
Means you're remembering stuff.

20:37.815 --> 20:38.940
Who was she?

20:44.071 --> 20:45.631
When did you start that again?

20:47.576 --> 20:49.357
I don't know, like 3 months ago.

20:54.165 --> 20:55.220
I was...

20:55.340 --> 20:57.458
I was sitting in this chair,

20:58.454 --> 20:59.790
when Roth came in.

21:01.291 --> 21:03.283
I wanted to go with him.

21:03.957 --> 21:05.873
He cared... so much.

21:07.845 --> 21:08.970
About what?

21:12.556 --> 21:14.993
What did he care so much about, Bob?

21:17.442 --> 21:20.322
He didn't care about the consequences

21:20.442 --> 21:22.283
of having an unregulated lab,

21:23.155 --> 21:24.725
or clinical trials.

21:25.405 --> 21:27.079
He was behind the cyanobacteria,

21:27.239 --> 21:30.384
he was behind the magnetobacteria,
he was behind the artificial smallpox.

21:30.504 --> 21:31.334
Now think.

21:31.979 --> 21:33.502
What does he care so much about?

21:33.662 --> 21:35.379
Because he brought us to the brink.

21:36.090 --> 21:39.967
He's not a scientist.
He trusted the people around him.

21:41.391 --> 21:43.429
What about the surgery on your brain?

21:45.973 --> 21:48.267
Was that a dead end
or was it a new beginning?

21:49.968 --> 21:53.694
Think, Bob! What did Olivier Roth
care about so much?

21:59.790 --> 22:02.884
There's something about what I've done,

22:03.845 --> 22:05.345
where I've been...

22:08.474 --> 22:11.544
I just don't know, David.
I just don't know.

22:14.075 --> 22:17.004
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.

22:22.783 --> 22:25.355
I gotta tell you, as long
as it stays locked up inside you,

22:25.475 --> 22:27.014
it scares the shit out of me.

22:28.100 --> 22:30.138
It scares me too, David.

22:34.936 --> 22:36.178
Thank you, David.

22:44.112 --> 22:47.251
- The levels must be off the chart.
- Doubled overnight.

22:50.900 --> 22:51.979
Dr. Cove.

22:52.775 --> 22:53.619
Rachel.

22:55.403 --> 22:58.546
- Dr. Sandström.
- Looks like you've got a full house.

22:59.106 --> 23:01.841
We've got 75 patients with acute Hep C.

23:02.254 --> 23:03.332
I need beds.

23:03.452 --> 23:06.011
We're calling other hospitals,
but they're just as crowded.

23:06.348 --> 23:08.952
- How many do you normally see a week?
- Hardly any.

23:09.072 --> 23:11.717
Acute Hep C is common
in developing countries,

23:12.513 --> 23:13.659
but this is unusual.

23:13.779 --> 23:16.439
It's rapidly progressing
into gastrointestinal haemorrhaging.

23:16.879 --> 23:19.785
- Hepatic encephalopathy?
- That's within days of first symptoms.

23:19.905 --> 23:20.863
Excuse me.

23:21.988 --> 23:23.320
Anything working?

23:24.206 --> 23:25.011
No.

23:27.657 --> 23:28.492
Glenn.

23:29.782 --> 23:32.413
- What happened?
- Remember how he said he had stopped?

23:33.017 --> 23:34.376
That he was clean?

23:35.279 --> 23:37.751
- I wish they'd just say the truth.
- I swear to you.

23:39.011 --> 23:40.796
Haven't shot nothin', Rachel.

23:41.391 --> 23:43.757
- I swear.
- Yeah, I know. I believe you, Glenn.

23:45.878 --> 23:48.478
Are you convinced
this is being spread by dirty needles?

23:48.598 --> 23:51.598
It's the most likely possibility.
We only find this in the IDU community.

23:52.020 --> 23:53.450
Can you give me a hand?

23:53.570 --> 23:54.621
Excuse me.

24:00.362 --> 24:02.471
- He was fine last time I saw him.
- When?

24:02.591 --> 24:03.762
Last weekend.

24:06.294 --> 24:08.872
Hep C doesn't do this to you that fast.

24:09.443 --> 24:11.785
Maybe we're not dealing with Hep C.

24:20.795 --> 24:24.340
I ran a detailed PCR analysis on
the blood of one of the Hep C patients.

24:24.724 --> 24:27.885
- I cannot figure this out.
- Neither can I.

24:28.045 --> 24:31.180
What do you mean?
The ELISA confirmed that it's HCV?

24:31.340 --> 24:34.186
All the patients are acutely infected
with the same virus,

24:34.306 --> 24:36.333
but I just... I don't get the strain.

24:36.453 --> 24:39.897
It seems to be a genetic mixture
of 4 different strains of HCV.

24:40.464 --> 24:41.523
Which ones?

24:41.683 --> 24:43.906
1a, predominantly found
in North America.

24:44.561 --> 24:46.690
5, from South Africa. 4, from Asia.

24:46.810 --> 24:49.448
And 3b...
pretty much worldwide.

24:50.097 --> 24:51.621
Worldwide. Okay.

24:53.706 --> 24:55.652
Any way these four strains could...

24:55.772 --> 24:57.790
- recombine naturally?
- Not likely.

24:58.199 --> 25:01.669
- Implausible, David.
- But not impossible, right? Come on.

25:04.319 --> 25:06.311
Let's say we've got a guy, right?

25:07.376 --> 25:10.678
He's already infected with HCV 3b.

25:11.689 --> 25:13.919
He just scored with his buddy,
who's got 1a,

25:14.039 --> 25:16.051
which is the Hep C of choice
in drug users.

25:16.438 --> 25:18.602
- That's what we're finding, yes.
- Okay.

25:18.762 --> 25:22.314
Now our guy decides
to take a little trip. Goes to...

25:23.517 --> 25:24.796
Shanghai. No.

25:25.227 --> 25:28.153
He goes to Cairo. Egypt has one
of the highest rates of infection

25:28.314 --> 25:29.962
for HCV in the world.

25:30.454 --> 25:32.074
That's where he meets Cleopatra.

25:32.235 --> 25:34.864
Bada bing, bada boom, yippee-ki-yay,

25:34.984 --> 25:39.462
not knowing
that Cleo is percolating HCV4

25:39.582 --> 25:42.710
she picked up from,
I don't know, a sex tourist.

25:43.154 --> 25:44.130
Okay?

25:44.250 --> 25:46.078
Now our guy goes to South Africa.

25:46.198 --> 25:47.423
One day,

25:47.583 --> 25:50.384
he's minding his own business,
he gets mugged.

25:55.716 --> 25:58.642
Yes, sir-ee.
Now he's got all four strains

25:58.802 --> 26:00.314
mixing it up inside him.

26:00.434 --> 26:02.521
What does he do? Flies home to Toronto,

26:02.681 --> 26:04.671
shares his trip
with his closest friends,

26:04.791 --> 26:06.642
and we're off to the races.

26:10.481 --> 26:11.281
What?

26:12.227 --> 26:15.159
Well, I think you should save that
for your next work of fiction.

26:15.673 --> 26:16.994
Think of the odds, David:

26:17.154 --> 26:18.353
the chances of being...

26:18.473 --> 26:21.484
infected with one of the strains
is low to begin with,

26:21.604 --> 26:25.627
but the chances of being co-infected
by all the strains is insanely remote.

26:25.959 --> 26:27.504
Maybe one in ten million.

26:27.665 --> 26:28.839
- Well...
- And then

26:28.999 --> 26:32.342
all the strains would have to infect
a single cell in order to re-arrange.

26:32.703 --> 26:36.263
Another one in ten million chance.
So for this perfect storm, do the math.

26:36.423 --> 26:40.058
- Not if I don't have to.
- That's a one in sextillion chance.

26:41.020 --> 26:41.851
21 zeroes.

26:42.521 --> 26:45.189
One trillion times
the number of people on Earth.

26:45.765 --> 26:47.858
Okay, you've spent way
too much time with Bob.

26:48.159 --> 26:51.069
In other words,
this is way beyond a natural fluke.

26:51.454 --> 26:54.156
So what are you saying,
that it's man-made? Engineered?

26:54.950 --> 26:57.749
No, to engineer something
you need to have a model to look at.

26:57.869 --> 27:00.305
There's a lot about this virus
that's familiar,

27:00.425 --> 27:03.916
but there's too many strange mutations
for it to have been made in a lab.

27:04.174 --> 27:05.626
Alright, so what happened?

27:06.190 --> 27:07.244
Unless...

27:12.260 --> 27:13.877
Unless we're both right.

27:14.252 --> 27:16.470
So it's natural and engineered?

27:16.733 --> 27:18.280
Yeah. What if...

27:20.530 --> 27:21.678
What if...

27:24.092 --> 27:24.895
Okay.

27:25.147 --> 27:26.688
You got four mice...

27:26.848 --> 27:29.413
Genetically manipulated
to have human liver cells.

27:29.533 --> 27:30.392
Exactly.

27:30.512 --> 27:32.964
And you infect each of these mice

27:33.084 --> 27:35.407
with the 4 Hep C strains
that we're talking about here.

27:35.527 --> 27:37.649
A different strain in each mouse.

27:37.769 --> 27:41.142
Now the virus can replicate itself
naturally.

27:41.869 --> 27:45.699
Cove said no drugs would work,
so maybe we're also treating these mice

27:45.819 --> 27:49.855
with, like, killing amounts
of interferon and ribavirin.

27:49.975 --> 27:53.017
Do that and all the drug-resistant
strains of the HCV

27:53.137 --> 27:55.175
- will begin to emerge...
- Naturally.

27:55.679 --> 27:58.679
Now you extract
each of the resistant strains

27:58.840 --> 28:01.264
out of each of the mice,
you purify them,

28:01.425 --> 28:04.708
and all together
we can use them to infect cells

28:04.828 --> 28:07.359
into a single comfy cozy cultured dish.

28:07.479 --> 28:10.273
We'll even throw in a little more
interferon for good measure.

28:10.433 --> 28:13.151
Eventually,
what we extract from the cells could be

28:13.687 --> 28:15.539
a genetic recombination

28:16.246 --> 28:19.241
of the four Hep C strains,
completely drug-resistant

28:19.401 --> 28:23.453
and that is how you could have
a multi-strained, naturally-engineered,

28:23.573 --> 28:26.665
drug-resistant,
highly virulent form of HCV.

28:27.084 --> 28:30.002
How does it get
into the IV drug community?

28:31.086 --> 28:34.953
A lab is trying to figure out
how viruses recombine

28:35.073 --> 28:37.250
- and accidentally releases it.
- But how?

28:38.249 --> 28:41.198
A lab tech accidentally gets infected

28:41.318 --> 28:45.475
and then he somehow passes it on
to a member of the drug-using community.

28:45.764 --> 28:47.602
How are we going to find out?

28:47.991 --> 28:50.647
We have 5 more dead
and 23 new confirmed cases.

28:52.397 --> 28:53.275
Mayko...

28:53.436 --> 28:56.595
find every lab
that has ordered humanized mice.

28:56.852 --> 28:59.009
Cross-reference that with hepatologists.

28:59.129 --> 29:02.367
Maybe that's how we'll find
our little odds-defying accident.

29:05.363 --> 29:06.538
Rachel, you okay?

29:10.602 --> 29:11.563
Yeah.

29:36.299 --> 29:37.281
Oh, shit!

29:45.595 --> 29:46.420
Bob?

30:05.413 --> 30:06.609
Hello, David.

30:09.660 --> 30:12.611
How is it you can smell the emotions
of all the people around you

30:12.731 --> 30:15.937
but you can't smell
a pot of burning chili on the stove?

30:17.043 --> 30:18.285
I was distracted.

30:18.777 --> 30:20.160
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

30:20.980 --> 30:22.457
We'll order take-out.

30:24.730 --> 30:26.113
You're frustrated.

30:26.605 --> 30:27.777
What happened?

30:29.172 --> 30:30.812
I've had better days.

30:31.246 --> 30:34.410
This hepatitis outbreak
is turning into an epidemic.

30:38.324 --> 30:39.541
I can help.

30:40.103 --> 30:42.716
Yeah. Couple more days
and I'll haul your ass back to the lab.

30:42.878 --> 30:44.191
We really need you there.

30:45.011 --> 30:45.949
Thank you.

30:51.117 --> 30:53.228
Anything else come back to you today?

31:03.114 --> 31:04.567
I was with someone...

31:05.621 --> 31:06.465
Roth?

31:07.660 --> 31:08.809
That same woman.

31:11.849 --> 31:12.670
Okay.

31:15.529 --> 31:17.052
Focus on her face.

31:18.623 --> 31:20.052
Does she have a name?

31:22.865 --> 31:24.259
Okay. Okay, Bob.

31:24.740 --> 31:25.748
It's okay.

31:28.439 --> 31:31.474
Look, I was talking
to this shrink that I used to date.

31:34.013 --> 31:35.748
She says that...

31:36.216 --> 31:40.316
drawing from the imagination
is really just drawing from memory.

31:42.012 --> 31:44.946
Leonardo da Vinci said
"You cannot draw what you cannot see".

31:45.645 --> 31:47.610
But you've seen everything, Bob.

31:47.730 --> 31:50.952
You just can't get your memories to that
part of your brain that can access them.

31:52.947 --> 31:54.705
So what do you want me to do?

31:55.545 --> 31:59.085
Draw whatever comes to mind.
A piece of this, a chunk of that.

31:59.245 --> 32:02.047
Maybe we can put it all together
and make some sense of it.

32:03.673 --> 32:04.892
Thank you, David.

32:07.937 --> 32:09.787
We're going to get it all back, Bob.

32:09.907 --> 32:11.055
Everything.

32:15.250 --> 32:16.164
I'll try.

32:39.491 --> 32:41.353
Okay, there are 2 distributors

32:41.473 --> 32:44.061
of the mouse strain
that you use to make humanized mice.

32:44.181 --> 32:47.929
There are
235 biopharmaceutical companies,

32:48.049 --> 32:50.460
universities,
and research facilities using them.

32:51.506 --> 32:55.454
I eliminated all the labs
that weren't working on Hepatitis C

32:56.039 --> 32:57.185
and brought it home.

33:00.375 --> 33:02.343
- Sorry I'm late.
- Oh! Here.

33:02.648 --> 33:04.429
Let me see that list.

33:09.362 --> 33:13.042
If you want to produce a Hep C virus
in your lab, what would you need?

33:13.765 --> 33:16.270
If they did the natural selection
in cell culture,

33:16.390 --> 33:18.248
plenty of HUH-7.5 cells.

33:18.854 --> 33:21.338
A culture hood,
roller bottle and a bioreactor...

33:22.346 --> 33:23.166
Wes?

33:23.752 --> 33:24.642
Got it.

33:25.533 --> 33:28.064
Good work, Mayko.
I'm gonna hang on to this.

33:33.818 --> 33:36.349
When he's available for comment,
I will let you know.

33:37.111 --> 33:38.447
Global News.

33:38.938 --> 33:40.813
They'd like some details
on the epidemic.

33:40.933 --> 33:43.961
It's going very well, thank you.
We're very pleased.

33:46.144 --> 33:48.581
First reports came back
from the university,

33:48.701 --> 33:51.561
Toronto Hospital, Nome Biotech...
All clean.

33:51.681 --> 33:53.767
Absolutely no sign of any Hep C strains.

33:53.887 --> 33:55.337
What about the other labs?

33:55.457 --> 33:57.605
We're checking
the Department of Health lab now.

33:57.725 --> 34:00.902
- The Division of Medicine's too busy.
- Get in there and get them tested.

34:01.022 --> 34:02.303
By the end of the day.

34:02.423 --> 34:04.835
Which leaves us waiting
for the next junkie to take a dirt nap.

34:05.211 --> 34:08.589
We don't know who made this strain,
let's try to find how it's spreading.

34:09.594 --> 34:11.938
Back to our hypothetical lab tech.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.012
He creates

34:15.090 --> 34:16.773
an HCV super strain.

34:16.893 --> 34:19.559
What he doesn't count on
is accidentally getting infected.

34:20.594 --> 34:22.603
Goes home and shares whatever...

34:22.764 --> 34:24.647
his girlfriend's toothbrush,

34:24.978 --> 34:27.400
or, I don't know, maybe they have sex.

34:27.770 --> 34:29.193
Maybe he's a closet junkie.

34:29.926 --> 34:32.655
But you'd think if he was smart enough
to create a super strain...

34:32.815 --> 34:35.143
- Why would he bother sharing needles.
- Yeah.

34:35.264 --> 34:38.940
The point is, he accidentally introduces
this into the IDU community.

34:39.061 --> 34:40.746
It doesn't fit the pattern, though,

34:40.908 --> 34:44.958
because the outbreak seemed to explode
simultaneously from multiple locations.

34:45.525 --> 34:46.511
Yeah.

34:50.239 --> 34:51.004
Shit.

34:51.163 --> 34:53.196
We're asking the wrong question.

34:53.688 --> 34:55.072
The lab tech...

34:56.629 --> 34:59.307
why the fuck would he make
this shit in the first place?

35:00.347 --> 35:02.013
Trying to create a vaccine?

35:02.133 --> 35:04.358
Create a vaccine for something
that would be,

35:04.478 --> 35:06.856
as you were all so keen
to point out to me the other day,

35:07.583 --> 35:09.233
a natural impossibility?

35:09.394 --> 35:10.985
You don't think it's an accident.

35:11.383 --> 35:12.862
Only thing that fits.

35:13.493 --> 35:15.948
Why would anybody
bother targeting junkies?

35:16.109 --> 35:20.099
Whatever the reason, if you wanted
to target the IDU community,

35:20.219 --> 35:23.372
- what would be the best way?
- It would take only one tainted needle.

35:23.532 --> 35:25.750
But the virus popped up
all over the place.

35:25.910 --> 35:28.878
- Five tainted needles.
- You know what, I doubt it.

35:29.281 --> 35:30.171
Why?

35:30.332 --> 35:32.900
Because Glenn, at the shelter,
he died from this outbreak

35:33.020 --> 35:35.595
- and he never shared needles.
- How do you know?

35:35.715 --> 35:37.970
Because he told me and I believed him.

35:39.933 --> 35:43.559
If tainted needles were distributed,
they'd be gone by now, tossed out.

35:43.720 --> 35:47.104
Yeah, and the rate of infection
sure says the source is still active.

35:48.633 --> 35:51.626
Which just means
that if the source is tainted needles,

35:51.746 --> 35:53.945
somebody's still giving them out.

35:55.494 --> 35:57.835
- Like, for free.
- Exchange clinics.

35:57.955 --> 36:01.118
And who supplies the needles
to the exchange clinics?

36:04.684 --> 36:05.629
Megan.

36:06.378 --> 36:07.864
- Hello!
- Hi.

36:07.984 --> 36:11.379
Megan, I'd like you to meet my wingman,
Wes. Wes, Megan.

36:11.842 --> 36:12.839
Yes, we've met.

36:14.014 --> 36:16.467
- Megan, I've got a favour to ask you.
- Shoot.

36:17.155 --> 36:20.346
We need samples of all the syringes
that you sent to the exchange clinics.

36:21.649 --> 36:24.016
Samples? Why, what's going on?

36:24.176 --> 36:26.646
We're not really sure.
We're just going on a hunch.

36:26.766 --> 36:28.938
You're the one
who accesses the syringes, right?

36:29.552 --> 36:32.873
That's sort of a formal way of saying
I pull boxes out of a closet.

36:32.993 --> 36:36.170
But sure, I'm the one
that "accesses" the syringes.

36:36.290 --> 36:39.824
- And then what do you do with them?
- I don't know what you're asking.

36:39.984 --> 36:42.593
The boxes are shipped
directly here from the manufacturer?

36:42.713 --> 36:45.077
Right, and then I sign for them
and distribute them

36:45.197 --> 36:47.832
to the various needle exchange programs
around the city...

36:48.576 --> 36:50.784
Could we get a look
at one of those boxes?

36:50.904 --> 36:51.804
Sure.

36:52.090 --> 36:55.984
We're really just a clearinghouse
for all the distribution centers.

36:56.386 --> 36:57.547
This is a box of 100.

36:57.667 --> 37:00.317
That's how they come in
and that's how I ship them out.

37:00.437 --> 37:02.430
And these boxes are never opened here?

37:02.995 --> 37:04.015
No reason to.

37:06.417 --> 37:09.520
We need to take a couple of these boxes.
Run some tests.

37:10.245 --> 37:11.606
On sterile syringes?

37:11.894 --> 37:15.318
Well, that's an assumption
and a conclusion we hope to come to.

37:16.848 --> 37:18.821
Sure. I'll be right back.

37:26.363 --> 37:29.248
- What do you mean they're all clean?
- Every one of them.

37:29.408 --> 37:31.250
It was a good hunch,
just not the right one.

37:31.946 --> 37:34.612
Unless of course
we picked up the wrong boxes...

37:34.923 --> 37:35.838
Alright.

37:35.998 --> 37:39.802
We're going to get every needle
from every needle exchange location

37:39.922 --> 37:42.261
- and we're gonna start all over again.
- Excuse me.

37:42.951 --> 37:45.890
- Rachel. Could I speak to you?
- We're kind of busy right now, Wes.

37:46.050 --> 37:47.183
It's important.

37:51.032 --> 37:53.140
Mayko, I want you to get down
to Public Health,

37:53.260 --> 37:55.485
get your hands
on every box of needles you can find.

37:55.605 --> 37:57.792
Carlos,
you do the needle exchange centers.

38:01.063 --> 38:01.922
Do it!

38:02.729 --> 38:03.590
Now!

38:16.369 --> 38:18.591
Alright, what's so important, Wes?

38:20.841 --> 38:23.190
I get my blood tested every 3 months.

38:23.647 --> 38:24.553
Why?

38:26.487 --> 38:28.015
I'm HIV-positive.

38:31.324 --> 38:32.144
Alright.

38:33.682 --> 38:35.631
So what, are you progressing?

38:35.863 --> 38:36.774
No.

38:37.645 --> 38:39.068
Then what's the problem?

38:41.571 --> 38:43.304
I've got Hepatitis C.

38:44.641 --> 38:46.103
I've been infected.

38:54.487 --> 38:57.082
I'm proof that the needles
from the Division of Health are tainted.

38:57.202 --> 38:59.630
Look, everybody just slow down.

39:01.804 --> 39:03.100
You shooting up?

39:03.815 --> 39:04.995
Okay, alright.

39:05.115 --> 39:07.429
I don't even go out in the rain
because of my HIV.

39:08.480 --> 39:09.348
Sex?

39:11.586 --> 39:14.895
I've only had sex with one person
in the last year and I wear a condom.

39:15.055 --> 39:17.656
- Are you sharing food? Drink?
- No.

39:17.776 --> 39:19.575
- Toothpaste?
- It's the fucking needle.

39:19.695 --> 39:22.236
If it was the fucking needle, Wes,
you'd be dead by now.

39:27.209 --> 39:30.431
Maybe the cocktail of drugs I'm on
for the HIV has slowed its progress.

39:30.551 --> 39:31.996
- Oh, Jesus...
- What?

39:32.801 --> 39:35.958
That's the wrong needles. You were stuck
with a blood collection needle.

39:36.118 --> 39:36.926
What?

39:38.462 --> 39:40.702
One of the IDUs
didn't want to get his blood tested

39:40.822 --> 39:42.423
and I got caught in the struggle.

39:43.239 --> 39:45.190
That's it. And it's fucking brilliant,

39:45.310 --> 39:47.864
because if you are targeting
IV drug users,

39:47.984 --> 39:49.387
anyone would check the needles,

39:49.548 --> 39:52.642
but no one would suspect
you tainted the collection kits.

39:54.136 --> 39:55.455
Wes, you...

39:56.733 --> 39:59.773
you better tell your partners
that they're at risk of having HCV.

40:00.692 --> 40:01.525
Yeah.

40:12.955 --> 40:14.154
Oh, shit...

40:36.063 --> 40:36.900
<i>Bob...</i>

40:38.368 --> 40:40.396
<i>I want you to come with me.</i>

40:44.979 --> 40:46.111
Let's go together.

41:08.571 --> 41:10.154
These are from the hypo factory,

41:10.274 --> 41:12.784
all part of a shipment of test kits
to Toronto Division of Health,

41:12.904 --> 41:14.223
and they all tested clean.

41:15.259 --> 41:18.227
Well, it definitively looks like
somebody tried to reseal these.

41:19.272 --> 41:22.898
I just got a positive from the Division
of Health's blood collecting needles.

41:27.500 --> 41:30.080
I think it's time
we did a little fishing.

41:40.416 --> 41:42.765
Make sure you get a sample
of the culture hood.

41:44.497 --> 41:46.458
- You found something here?
- Dr. Cove.

41:46.578 --> 41:48.089
- In my lab?
- Yeah. Not yet.

41:48.209 --> 41:50.686
We're still taking samples.
But we did find a whole bunch of shit

41:50.806 --> 41:53.554
in the needles your office ordered
for use in their blood collection kits.

41:53.972 --> 41:57.599
- So, what do you think? Someone...
- No, we know. We proved it.

41:57.759 --> 41:59.637
Someone from my office?

41:59.757 --> 42:01.687
- Why?
- What have you got?

42:01.847 --> 42:03.874
Like, 10 or 15 people
working out of this lab?

42:03.994 --> 42:05.325
- 17.
- Right.

42:06.586 --> 42:09.111
This is a pretty high-tech
piece of equipment you got here.

42:09.271 --> 42:10.725
You use this often?

42:11.433 --> 42:12.858
No, not often.

42:13.692 --> 42:15.826
You know what,
get a sample from the bioreactor too.

42:16.346 --> 42:19.771
Why would you use a Mercedes
to make huge amounts of mammalian cells?

42:19.891 --> 42:21.874
- Isn't that overkill?
- As I just said,

42:22.035 --> 42:23.630
we don't use it often.

42:28.767 --> 42:29.684
Right.

42:33.717 --> 42:35.838
How come a man in your position

42:36.391 --> 42:38.223
still works in the field?

42:39.055 --> 42:41.518
I'm a hands-on scientist, just like you.

42:45.196 --> 42:46.890
Here's what I'm thinking.

42:47.969 --> 42:49.326
I think somebody in this lab

42:49.446 --> 42:51.945
put the Hep C super strain
in these collection needles.

42:52.905 --> 42:55.251
I don't know why.
Maybe they'd had enough of drug users,

42:55.371 --> 42:56.990
maybe they just wanted to...

42:57.110 --> 42:58.768
clean up the streets.

42:59.258 --> 43:02.122
I gotta admit it was really smart,
making it look like a natural outbreak.

43:02.902 --> 43:06.752
I'm going to assume that these...
insinuations are directed at me.

43:09.570 --> 43:12.049
If you'll excuse me, Doctor,
I have a lot of work to do.

43:12.209 --> 43:13.258
So do we.

43:16.048 --> 43:17.638
Do you have a warrant to be here?

43:19.619 --> 43:22.641
Somebody in this lab murdered 35 people

43:22.761 --> 43:25.228
and hung a death sentence
around hundreds of others.

43:26.794 --> 43:28.489
I am asking you to leave.

43:33.127 --> 43:35.822
It's you. Jesus, you did it, didn't you?

43:37.615 --> 43:39.705
I don't deny
that every time a fucking user

43:39.825 --> 43:41.133
puts a needle in their arm

43:41.253 --> 43:43.267
they're pounding
another nail in their coffin.

43:43.387 --> 43:45.415
Is that what you wanna hear?

43:47.622 --> 43:50.344
I am gonna check
every inch of this fucking lab,

43:50.886 --> 43:53.953
and if I find any RNA
that matches the HCV

43:54.073 --> 43:55.509
that you put out there...

43:57.413 --> 43:59.559
Of course you're going to find
the HCV RNA here.

43:59.679 --> 44:01.614
We work with it 
in every part of the lab.

44:01.734 --> 44:04.524
- What is that going to prove?
- How many needles did you taint?

44:04.644 --> 44:07.104
- Hundreds? Thousands?
- Get out of my lab.

44:07.774 --> 44:09.725
Come on. You're wasting your time.

44:10.308 --> 44:11.632
We'll be back.

44:12.686 --> 44:13.824
Count on it.

44:14.829 --> 44:16.093
Let's go, guys.

44:26.439 --> 44:29.584
Wes. I went in there on a fishing trip,
I came out with a goddamn trophy.

44:30.259 --> 44:32.300
<i>It was Cove.
He put the HCV in the needles.</i>

44:32.420 --> 44:35.156
- How are we going to prove it?
<i>- No idea, but his lab's a crime scene,</i>

44:35.276 --> 44:36.550
ask the cops to close it.

44:36.711 --> 44:39.219
Nobody goes in, nothing comes out.
Do it now, Wes.

44:53.129 --> 44:54.985
Your blood work came back.

44:56.254 --> 44:58.310
It's the Hep C super strain.

45:02.685 --> 45:04.189
How long have I got?

45:08.181 --> 45:09.833
I'm sorry, Wes.

45:19.336 --> 45:22.971
There's an unusually high incidence
of brain inflammation in Michigan.

45:23.131 --> 45:24.681
11 people on the verge of death.

45:24.841 --> 45:26.863
Why my dad? He was healthy.

45:26.983 --> 45:30.065
The local doctor
thinks it's progressive multifocal

45:30.185 --> 45:32.022
- leukoencepha...
- Encephalopathy?

45:32.182 --> 45:34.608
- Contagious PML?
- That's not possible.

45:35.602 --> 45:37.314
Now you know why we called you.

45:37.434 --> 45:39.102
I'm experiencing strange memories.

45:39.222 --> 45:41.448
Roth's lab, except it's deserted.

45:41.608 --> 45:43.203
The woman I was thinking about...

45:43.323 --> 45:45.827
I looked out across the street
and saw her...

45:45.988 --> 45:47.287
So beautiful.

45:49.315 --> 45:52.375
I don't wanna die, Rachel.
What about the Amsterdam treatment?

45:52.535 --> 45:54.711
They hope
to start human trials in 18 months.

45:54.996 --> 45:57.172
Wes doesn't have 18 days.
