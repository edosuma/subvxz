Come on, sweetie.
You know we needed more room.

- Hey. Come to help us unpack?

No. But I will.
Guess what.

01:28.067 --> 01:31.800
It only took me eight minutes
and 46 seconds to get here.

I was washing my face

and I went to reach for my towel,
and it was there.

- What was there?
- That ugly sponge.

05:16.933 --> 05:21.000

- No.

I'm gonna go take a ride
around later. See if I can find him.

It's not like him
just to run off like that.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.500
Bad things were happening,
and they were getting worse.

06:54.500 --> 06:57.467
First it was my mom's
smashed dishes.

06:57.467 --> 07:00.467
Then my brother's cut foot.

07:00.467 --> 07:02.467

- Wow.

- No. Dad's checkin' the pound.

going on here.

it's all tied in with that sponge.

Killer sponge from Mars.

All I know is that ever

- This is better than The X Files.

Kat, this sponge is amazing.
It needs to be studied.

08:53.933 --> 08:55.433

No. It needs to be dead.

of science not to do this.

11:08.767 --> 11:11.567
We need an expert.
I'm gonna take it to school.

11:12.067 --> 11:15.067
Maybe Miss Vanderhoff
will know what to do with it.

11:20.167 --> 11:22.167
Aha.

11:22.667 --> 11:24.667
Just as I suspected.

11:25.167 --> 11:27.167
It's a sponge.

11:28.167 --> 11:31.167
I know that.
But what kind of a sponge?

11:31.667 --> 11:34.700
Garden-variety natural
kitchen sponge, by the look of it.

11:34.700 --> 11:37.467
[ Chuckles ]
Well, this thing is weird.

11:37.467 --> 11:39.967
It has eyes and everything.

11:40.467 --> 11:43.467
Eyes?
Sponges don't have eyes.

11:43.967 --> 11:46.033
Well, maybe it's not a sponge then.

- Mm-hmm.
- Just make sure that whatever you do,

you put it back in its cage

12:51.700 --> 12:53.700
"Encyclopaedia of the Weird"?

- Does it have her picture in it?
- [ Laughs ]

12:56.700 --> 12:58.700
So what does the book say?

12:58.700 --> 13:02.200
It says that your weirdo sponge
is actually a grool.

13:02.200 --> 13:03.700
A grool?

13:04.233 --> 13:06.333
What's a grool?

13:08.333 --> 13:11.333
Theoretically, a grool
is mythological creature...

13:11.833 --> 13:13.600
believed to be
a living bad-luck charm.

13:13.600 --> 13:16.600
- You mean it causes bad luck?
- Exactly.

13:16.600 --> 13:19.433
And then it feeds
on the bad luck it causes.

13:19.433 --> 13:23.033
Each time something bad happens
it gets stronger.

13:23.033 --> 13:25.533
Well, that explains all the accidents.

13:25.533 --> 13:27.267
Does it say how to kill it?

13:27.267 --> 13:29.667
Mmm, no.

13:29.667 --> 13:32.567
- Do you really buy all this?
- Straight from the book.

- [ Daniel ] A what?
- A lanx.

at a time, all right?

13:46.567 --> 13:49.200
Why don't we just mail it
to the north pole,

13:49.200 --> 13:51.900
- or drop it in the ocean or something?
- Not a good idea.

13:51.900 --> 13:55.200
If the owner gives a grool away,
the owner dies.

13:55.200 --> 13:56.700
I must be the owner.

- [ Groans ]
- [ Gasps ]

16:30.833 --> 16:33.133
Come on.

16:39.333 --> 16:43.433
- Is he dead?
- [ Kitty ] No. He's breathing.

16:43.433 --> 16:46.367
- [ Scraping ]
- I know that sound.

16:46.367 --> 16:48.633
[ Daniel ]
We've gotta get help.

16:48.633 --> 16:50.800
You just stay with him, all right?

16:51.300 --> 16:54.433
I think it came from the shelves.
I'll go check it out.

16:54.433 --> 16:56.433
[ Daniel ]
Okay.

16:56.433 --> 16:59.433
Oh, man. He took a really
bad bump on the head.

16:59.933 --> 17:01.933
[ Carlo ]
He's out cold.

17:06.767 --> 17:08.666
"Danger. Acid."

17:18.433 --> 17:21.700
- [ Snarling ]
- [ Kitty Screaming ]

17:23.233 --> 17:25.967
- Oh!
- Kat! Watch out.

17:28.800 --> 17:31.033
[ Daniel ]
Kat, are you all right?

17:31.533 --> 17:34.333
It's okay. I'm fine, really.

17:34.333 --> 17:36.333
[ Scraping ]

17:37.767 --> 17:40.433
Oh, no.
Look at this mess.

17:40.933 --> 17:43.033
It's going everywhere.

17:43.033 --> 17:44.967
The door's blocked!
We're trapped!

17:44.967 --> 17:49.433
And that thing, the grool--
It's growing. What are we gonna do?

17:49.900 --> 17:51.833
We'll have to go out the window!
Come on.

17:54.833 --> 17:58.067
[ Kitty ] I'll grab his legs. Come on.
We'll have to carry him up.

17:58.067 --> 18:01.000
- [ Daniel Groans ]
- [ Clatters ]

18:01.000 --> 18:03.900
- What's that?
- It's his tape player.

18:03.900 --> 18:05.833
- [ Tape Player: Indistinct ]
- [ Snarling ]

18:06.767 --> 18:08.767
[ Kitty ]
Look at the grool. It's shrinking.

18:08.767 --> 18:12.100
- Why? What's happening?
- I don't think it likes the music.

18:12.100 --> 18:15.167
Neither do I,
but why would it hate the music?

18:15.167 --> 18:17.167
[ Daniel ]
'Cause it makes you wanna puke.

18:17.167 --> 18:19.433
Yeah, but why does
it make you wanna puke?

18:19.433 --> 18:21.367
'Cause it's so happy.

18:22.067 --> 18:25.233
That's it. The grool loves bad,
so it must hate good.

18:25.233 --> 18:28.767
Happy is good.
Go turn up the music.

18:28.767 --> 18:30.767
I'm gonna see if
I can get it in its cage.

18:33.600 --> 18:35.733
[ Tape Runs Down ]

18:36.200 --> 18:38.100
Daniel?
Daniel, what happened?

18:39.167 --> 18:40.767
Nothing.

18:40.767 --> 18:43.267
[ Carlo ] It's growing again.
We've gotta do something.

18:43.800 --> 18:46.500
- What?
- Sing the song, Kat. Sing!

18:46.500 --> 18:49.967
- I don't know the words.
- Well, make something up.

18:49.967 --> 18:52.400
- Um-- um--
- And make it corny.

18:52.400 --> 18:55.900
Did I ever tell you
what a wonderful sponge you are?

18:55.900 --> 19:00.400
- [ Carlo ] Great. It's working. Keep going.
- So-- So handsome.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.600
- So terrific.
- Of course.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.567
Brilliant.
Kill it with kindness.

19:04.567 --> 19:08.500
I love your big, beautiful eyes--
All of them.

19:08.500 --> 19:11.133
I love what you've done
with your hair.

19:11.133 --> 19:15.200
And-and that skin-- So damp
and yellow and absorbent.

19:15.200 --> 19:19.433
When I grow up, I wanna
be a killer sponge just like you.

19:19.433 --> 19:21.733
- [ Carlo ] Uh-oh. Look at the chemicals.
- [ Janitor Groaning ]

19:21.733 --> 19:24.000
- [ Daniel ] What's that smell?
- It's growing again.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.400
- [ Coughing ]
- [ Janitor ] What-- What's happening?

19:26.400 --> 19:29.733
Kids! Kids!

19:30.133 --> 19:32.833
Stay where you are.
I'll take care of it.

19:35.500 --> 19:38.900
- [ Coughs ]
- I've got this under control.

19:45.800 --> 19:49.567
- [ Kids Coughing ]
- [ Janitor ] Ah.

19:49.567 --> 19:50.967
Aha!

19:53.700 --> 19:56.233
- Hey, it worked.
- All right.

19:56.233 --> 19:58.233
[ Daniel ]
Cool. It shrunk.

20:09.167 --> 20:12.167
[ Kitty ] As it said in the
Encyclopaedia of the Weird,

20:12.167 --> 20:14.167
I couldn't get rid of the grool.

20:14.167 --> 20:16.167
- It's mine forever.
- [ Knocking ]

20:16.167 --> 20:20.167
So I did the next best thing.

20:21.667 --> 20:23.833
Good morning, "Grooly."

20:23.833 --> 20:26.033
Another beautiful day.

20:31.900 --> 20:36.033
- There you go. Enjoy your music.
- [ Dance Pop ]

20:36.033 --> 20:39.567
[ Killer Barking ]

20:40.067 --> 20:43.067
- [ Barking ]
- Killer!

20:43.067 --> 20:45.200
Oh, Killer, you're back!

20:45.700 --> 20:47.700
- Come here, boy.
- Killer! How's it goin', big guy?

20:48.200 --> 20:50.700
- Yeah!
- Oh, boy, where have you been?

20:50.700 --> 20:52.700
- See? I told you he'd come back.
- Good boy.

20:53.200 --> 20:55.200
- Okay, everyone... French toast.
- Oh, all right.

20:55.700 --> 20:58.200
- Yes!
- Yeah.

20:58.200 --> 21:00.700
Killer.
What did you bring me, huh?

21:00.700 --> 21:02.700
What did you bring back?

21:03.700 --> 21:05.700
What is it?

21:07.533 --> 21:10.333
- A potato?
- [ Snarls ]

21:10.333 --> 21:13.000
[ Screaming ]
