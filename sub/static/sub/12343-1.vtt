00:06.039 --> 00:09.342
March 15, 2000... the day of infamy,

00:09.343 --> 00:10.977
as far as I'm concerned.

00:12.000 --> 00:18.074

00:19.653 --> 00:21.120
I woke up in the morning,

00:21.121 --> 00:23.956
started having coffee,
telling our team of people

00:23.957 --> 00:26.326
that had just arrived that,
you know, the chances

00:26.327 --> 00:31.030
of seeing a beaked whale
in a 10‐day period are slim.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.265
My assistant, Dave,

00:32.266 --> 00:34.500
came running inside and saying, "Ken!

00:34.501 --> 00:36.135
Ken! There's a beaked whale
right on the beach,

00:36.136 --> 00:37.738
right in front of the house!"

00:39.706 --> 00:42.642
And sure enough, there was
a goose‐beaked whale swimming...

00:42.643 --> 00:44.677
Moving his tail anyway,

00:44.678 --> 00:48.948
as if it was trying to get up the beach.

00:48.949 --> 00:51.584
In my mind, or maybe out loud,

00:51.585 --> 00:54.587
I said,

00:54.588 --> 00:56.390
"what are you doing here?"

01:01.602 --> 01:03.804
They're supposed to be in deep water.

01:06.840 --> 01:09.409
So I pushed it back out to sea.

01:12.346 --> 01:15.981
Go, baby, go!

01:15.982 --> 01:19.219
It swam out a little ways.

01:19.220 --> 01:22.255
And it came back in.

01:22.256 --> 01:23.956
We did this two or three times.

01:23.957 --> 01:25.658
And then some neighbors
came along and said,

01:25.659 --> 01:28.094
"there's another one down at the point."

01:33.634 --> 01:37.370
Covered it with, uh, sheets
and kept splashing water on it,

01:37.371 --> 01:40.407
while the rest kept trying
to push the other whale out.

01:42.709 --> 01:45.010
And then our neighbors came
and said, "there's another whale

01:45.011 --> 01:48.815
just another 200 yards
up the beach from us."

01:55.222 --> 01:58.090
As the day unfolded,
we had people calling

01:58.091 --> 02:02.335
from all over the Northern
Bahamas saying,

02:02.336 --> 02:05.138
"a whale strand here,
whale strands there."

02:12.946 --> 02:15.215
Something was causing all these whales

02:15.216 --> 02:17.450
to wanna abandon the deep water

02:17.451 --> 02:19.920
and get the hell outta there.

02:22.456 --> 02:24.558
It was, uh, kinda devastating.

02:27.794 --> 02:30.162
Animals that I had grown to know

02:30.163 --> 02:34.368
over a 10‐year period were now dead.

02:36.370 --> 02:39.705
They were trying to get away.

02:39.706 --> 02:43.109
I was driven to find out why.

03:40.674 --> 03:42.042
Everywhere on Earth,

03:42.043 --> 03:44.910
we can hear the songs of life...

03:44.911 --> 03:47.947
From the smallest insects

03:47.948 --> 03:50.250
to the largest animals on the planet.

03:51.885 --> 03:56.389
But most of us only hear half
of this living symphony.

03:56.390 --> 03:58.424
There's a completely different orchestra

03:58.425 --> 04:01.001
playing beneath the surface of the sea.

04:03.570 --> 04:06.105
One of the most memorable moments

04:06.106 --> 04:08.508
I have in my life

04:08.509 --> 04:11.010
was the first time I put on headphones

04:11.011 --> 04:12.778
in the arctic.

04:12.779 --> 04:14.214
It's gray and white.

04:14.215 --> 04:16.516
It's almost sensory...
Complete sensory deprivation.

04:16.517 --> 04:17.617
I can't smell anything.

04:17.618 --> 04:20.084
I can barely taste anything.

04:20.086 --> 04:22.322
We found a little opening of water,

04:22.323 --> 04:25.659
in which I dropped
two underwater microphones.

04:28.061 --> 04:32.165
Put on the headphones,
I was completely amazed.

04:44.478 --> 04:47.079
Bearded seals coming out of the ether,

04:47.080 --> 04:50.316
as though they were from
"the martian chronicles."

04:56.223 --> 04:59.866
Beluga whales chirping
and chattering and clicking.

05:03.237 --> 05:05.338
And then the bowhead whales,

05:05.339 --> 05:08.942
roaring low‐frequency moans.

05:12.946 --> 05:15.315
And I was like, "Oh, my God!

05:15.316 --> 05:17.418
This is fantastic!"

05:20.421 --> 05:22.355
Chris Clark has been recording

05:22.356 --> 05:25.258
the symphony of life on Earth

05:25.459 --> 05:29.329
for more than 40 years.

05:29.330 --> 05:31.497
He has built one
of the largest collections

05:31.498 --> 05:35.268
of animal sounds on the planet.

05:35.269 --> 05:37.470
I listen to the world.

05:37.471 --> 05:40.906
And to me, song is life.

05:40.907 --> 05:43.309
It is the essence of who we are.

05:43.310 --> 05:45.111
And it joins us all.

05:53.220 --> 05:55.255
The problem is, in the ocean,

05:55.256 --> 05:59.625
we are injecting
enormous amounts of noise,

05:59.626 --> 06:01.367
so much so that we are basically

06:01.368 --> 06:06.171
acoustically bleaching the ocean.

06:06.172 --> 06:10.543
All the singing voices of the planet

06:10.544 --> 06:15.481
are lost in that cloud of noise.

06:15.482 --> 06:17.250
This accumulation of sound

06:17.251 --> 06:21.854
is changing the entire
ecosystem underwater.

06:21.855 --> 06:24.290
Some of the animals
most directly affected

06:24.291 --> 06:26.226
by this Sonic invasion

06:26.227 --> 06:29.263
are the largest ever
to have lived on Earth.

06:41.742 --> 06:43.075
They're so large.

06:43.076 --> 06:46.547
And they're so dramatic and magnificent.

06:55.121 --> 06:58.658
They are highly conscious animals.

06:58.659 --> 07:01.502
They have self‐awareness.
They think.

07:05.372 --> 07:10.477
They have intellectual
capabilities that rival ours.

07:18.852 --> 07:21.921
And their graciousness...

07:21.922 --> 07:23.523
They're mammals.
They're just like us.

07:23.524 --> 07:26.692
They're a very specialized form

07:26.693 --> 07:29.028
of life on this planet that,

07:29.029 --> 07:31.131
basically, rules the ocean.

07:33.967 --> 07:37.069
All whales can hear.

07:37.070 --> 07:38.972
They have to for their survival.

07:49.983 --> 07:52.918
The ocean is a completely
different place

07:52.919 --> 07:56.656
acoustically than in the air.

07:56.657 --> 08:01.301
Sound can travel enormous distances

08:01.302 --> 08:03.469
very, very fast,

08:03.470 --> 08:06.039
whereas light doesn't
travel very far at all.

08:08.442 --> 08:12.112
And the whales have evolved
to take advantage of that.

08:15.482 --> 08:19.386
They can hear storms
that are 1,000 miles away.

08:24.525 --> 08:29.395
For humans, well,
it's important for us to hear,

08:29.396 --> 08:31.431
but not nearly as important

08:31.432 --> 08:33.933
as it is for whales, dolphins

08:33.933 --> 08:35.602
and many kinds of fish.

08:39.005 --> 08:41.640
They're relying on being able

08:41.642 --> 08:44.278
to sense their environment acoustically.

08:51.117 --> 08:54.053
Whether it's finding their buddies,

08:54.054 --> 08:57.057
knowing where food is,
knowing where the shoreline is.

08:59.893 --> 09:01.166
Well, they certainly have eyes.

09:01.167 --> 09:02.635
And they use their eyes.

09:02.636 --> 09:04.737
But they're far more reliant

09:04.738 --> 09:08.608
on their hearing to live.

09:08.609 --> 09:11.911
Think about it... even in
the clearest ocean water,

09:11.912 --> 09:17.149
visibility is nothing close
to what you have on the land.

09:17.150 --> 09:21.186
And 100 feet is considered
to be really good.

09:21.187 --> 09:23.223
But you can look up at the stars

09:23.224 --> 09:25.825
and see light that has been transmitted

09:25.826 --> 09:28.528
over millions of miles on the land.

09:28.529 --> 09:34.367
You can look and see mountains
in the distance, miles away.

09:34.368 --> 09:39.439
Just as air is a brilliant
medium for light,

09:39.440 --> 09:42.943
water is a brilliant medium for sound.

09:47.047 --> 09:49.515
To give you an example,

09:49.516 --> 09:51.351
in the early 1990s,

09:51.352 --> 09:52.852
a group of scientists

09:52.853 --> 09:55.588
put a noise-making device, uh,

09:55.589 --> 09:58.791
down in the Southern Indian ocean.

09:58.792 --> 10:03.236
They wanted to see
just how far sound would travel.

10:03.237 --> 10:07.039
The sound that they produced
carried into the Atlantic ocean,

10:07.040 --> 10:09.008
into the Pacific ocean.

10:09.009 --> 10:10.175
It carried as far

10:10.176 --> 10:12.077
as those researchers were listening.

10:12.078 --> 10:15.415
Their furthest hydrophone,
or underwater microphone,

10:15.416 --> 10:18.784
was positioned off of Washington state,

10:18.785 --> 10:23.323
which means that the sound
traveled some 17,000 kilometers

10:23.324 --> 10:25.125
and was still audible.

10:28.462 --> 10:32.498
And the whales see the ocean
through sound.

10:32.499 --> 10:35.902
So their mind's eye is their mind's ear.

10:43.379 --> 10:47.015
So I'm in this tent with
an Inupiat whaling captain.

10:47.016 --> 10:50.385
And I want the ears for science.

10:50.386 --> 10:52.821
I wanna get the ear bones of the whale

10:52.822 --> 10:54.389
so that I can give 'em to a colleague,

10:54.390 --> 10:56.725
who is a scientist, to understand,

10:56.726 --> 10:58.160
how do they hear?

10:58.161 --> 11:02.537
What... what is so different
about these animals?

11:02.538 --> 11:06.642
And this Inupiat whaling captain
just looked at me.

11:06.643 --> 11:10.512
And very deliberately, he said,

11:10.513 --> 11:15.383
"do you know that the ears
are the entrance

11:15.384 --> 11:17.921
to the soul of the whale?"

11:20.189 --> 11:23.860
And now, I even get emotional
remembering that statement.

11:27.964 --> 11:30.065
The ears of this animal

11:30.066 --> 11:33.769
are the entrance
to its self‐consciousness,

11:33.770 --> 11:37.006
to its life, to its history,
to its future.

11:56.259 --> 11:57.759
The Bahamas stranding, well,

11:57.760 --> 12:01.236
we had specimens
that had died within hours.

12:01.237 --> 12:02.905
And I knew

12:02.906 --> 12:06.008
that collecting a fresh specimen

12:06.009 --> 12:08.710
and freezing it as soon as possible

12:08.711 --> 12:10.645
would provide the best evidence

12:10.646 --> 12:12.948
that would show what sort of damage

12:12.949 --> 12:15.617
was going on internally.

12:15.618 --> 12:18.186
I transported two beaked whale heads

12:18.187 --> 12:22.190
and a dolphin from Bahamas

12:22.191 --> 12:24.392
and got 'em over
to a commercial airplane

12:24.393 --> 12:26.428
going to Boston.

12:26.429 --> 12:28.797
Trucked the specimens
right over to the cat scans

12:28.798 --> 12:31.199
at Harvard medical school and,

12:31.200 --> 12:32.735
by 2 A. M.,

12:32.736 --> 12:36.104
had seen the evidence
of sub-arachnoid hemorrhage

12:36.105 --> 12:40.944
around the brain and blood
around the ears.

12:43.279 --> 12:47.083
Uh, they were definitely, uh, impacted.

12:49.152 --> 12:55.090
I knew that it was
a human‐caused stranding.

12:55.091 --> 12:57.760
I was very concerned that, uh, we learn

12:57.761 --> 13:01.036
what specifically are we doing that

13:01.037 --> 13:03.538
is causing these mortalities,

13:03.539 --> 13:06.109
and not do this again.

13:10.714 --> 13:14.182
Humans have been changing
the sound of the oceans

13:14.183 --> 13:17.352
since we first started
exploring the seas.

13:17.353 --> 13:20.088
But our ocean presence has exploded

13:20.089 --> 13:22.225
over the last 5 decades.

13:30.599 --> 13:32.468
The world that these
long‐lived creatures

13:32.469 --> 13:36.773
have experienced
is changed on a geologic scale.

13:38.875 --> 13:41.945
We are seeing just a different planet.

13:45.114 --> 13:50.986
Some whales, they live
to be 150 to 200 years old.

13:50.987 --> 13:53.689
When those whales were teenagers,

13:53.690 --> 13:56.825
the world was quiet.
Okay?

13:56.826 --> 14:00.402
So if I disrupt your ability to hunt,

14:00.403 --> 14:02.738
or if I disrupt the ability of a female

14:02.739 --> 14:04.807
to make a choice
between the best singers

14:04.808 --> 14:06.775
because she can only hear the ones

14:06.776 --> 14:09.712
that are closest to her,

14:09.713 --> 14:11.781
what's the impact of that?

14:13.883 --> 14:15.618
Getting lost in the ocean

14:15.619 --> 14:19.087
must be terrifying to a young whale.

14:19.088 --> 14:22.891
Can't find its mother.
Can't find its family.

14:22.892 --> 14:25.828
A lost whale, in that sense,

14:25.829 --> 14:28.264
would be, likely, a dead whale.

14:32.468 --> 14:34.703
Uh, I've known about
whale song for a long time.

14:34.704 --> 14:36.571
And I've heard it many times.

14:36.572 --> 14:39.507
And also astounded by how...

14:39.508 --> 14:42.044
The distance
that their songs can travel,

14:42.045 --> 14:45.413
that they have to communicate,
sometimes, ocean‐wide.

14:45.414 --> 14:47.316
Um, it's like a telephone.

14:50.654 --> 14:52.320
And so it would be logical

14:52.321 --> 14:54.757
that their hearing would be as powerful

14:54.758 --> 14:58.166
as their reach when... when they sing.

14:58.167 --> 14:59.935
I make my living as a musician.

14:59.936 --> 15:04.607
I've subjected myself
to industrial levels of noise

15:04.608 --> 15:06.208
because of it.

15:06.209 --> 15:08.110
And my hearing is impaired.

15:08.111 --> 15:10.713
And so I'm increasingly more aware

15:10.714 --> 15:13.649
of the Sonic world we live in.

15:13.650 --> 15:15.351
I prefer silence.

15:17.520 --> 15:19.221
I was born and raised, um,

15:19.222 --> 15:21.389
next to a shipyard
in the North of England.

15:21.390 --> 15:23.826
At the end of my street
are some of the biggest,

15:23.827 --> 15:28.030
um, ships ever constructed
on planet Earth.

15:28.031 --> 15:31.566
They would launch them with the,
uh, timbers cracking

15:31.567 --> 15:33.869
and the drag chains being pulled.

15:33.870 --> 15:35.070
And as a small child, I...

15:35.071 --> 15:39.609
I found that, uh,
stirring and frightening.

15:42.979 --> 15:45.948
No, you wouldn't think about
what was going on under the sea.

15:45.949 --> 15:49.051
It was just some...
A means of, you know,

15:49.052 --> 15:51.687
transporting things
or transporting people,

15:51.688 --> 15:55.190
rather than, uh, to go underneath it.

15:55.191 --> 15:56.792
The dominant change

15:56.793 --> 15:58.433
in the conditions of underwater noise

15:58.434 --> 16:01.503
has been from commercial shipping.

16:01.504 --> 16:04.740
So, ships are the way
we really move goods

16:04.741 --> 16:07.009
on this planet.

16:07.010 --> 16:10.312
We move over 98 percent of the stuff

16:10.313 --> 16:14.217
we need to get from point A
to point B using ships.

16:16.419 --> 16:17.820
At any given time,

16:17.821 --> 16:21.189
there are an estimated
60,000 commercial chips

16:21.190 --> 16:23.359
traversing the world's oceans.

16:27.363 --> 16:30.165
They're enormous.
They're like cities on water

16:30.166 --> 16:32.801
with far fewer people.

16:32.802 --> 16:36.271
And the sound of all of those ships,

16:36.272 --> 16:38.140
all in the water at once,

16:38.141 --> 16:41.877
has literally filled our oceans with...

16:41.878 --> 16:43.746
With noise.

16:43.747 --> 16:47.783
One of the things
about noise in the ocean

16:47.784 --> 16:50.418
is that humans are not
aware of it at all.

16:50.419 --> 16:54.322
It's one of these out of sight,
out of mind kind of things.

16:54.323 --> 16:56.524
It really is, in a...
In a sense, a cacophony

16:56.525 --> 16:57.726
of sound

16:57.727 --> 17:01.704
that surrounds the whales at this point.

17:01.705 --> 17:04.873
Paul Spong is
the Co‐Director of Orcalab,

17:04.874 --> 17:06.340
a Whale‐research Station

17:06.342 --> 17:09.545
on Hanson Island
off British Columbia, Canada.

17:13.617 --> 17:16.084
He and his team
use hydrophones to record

17:16.085 --> 17:17.953
and study the sounds of orca pods

17:17.954 --> 17:19.888
in the Pacific Northwest.

17:22.659 --> 17:26.029
There are a host of reasons
for caring about whales.

17:29.966 --> 17:33.703
Certainly the beauty
and their lifestyle.

17:36.505 --> 17:38.607
With orcas, you have, for example,

17:38.608 --> 17:39.975
the most powerful creature in...

17:39.976 --> 17:44.346
On the planet living
an utterly peaceful life.

17:44.347 --> 17:46.149
That's impressive.

17:48.685 --> 17:50.518
Each of the family groups has, uh,

17:50.519 --> 17:52.287
their own special dialect

17:52.288 --> 17:54.222
that we listen to.

17:54.223 --> 17:56.792
So we can understand a lot
about who's there just from...

17:56.793 --> 17:59.668
Just from the sounds that they make.

17:59.669 --> 18:03.171
We know when they're hunting.
We know when they're resting.

18:03.172 --> 18:05.140
We know when they're socializing.

18:05.141 --> 18:07.375
We know when they're having
a great time together

18:07.376 --> 18:08.877
down at the rubbing beaches

18:08.878 --> 18:12.380
'cause we're listening all the time.

18:12.381 --> 18:14.149
Cruise ships, the freighters

18:14.150 --> 18:16.919
are very recent phenomena
in their history.

18:16.920 --> 18:20.255
Now, sound is everywhere around them,

18:20.256 --> 18:22.490
much of the time.

18:22.491 --> 18:24.392
When a cruise ship comes along.

18:24.393 --> 18:26.328
And a cruise ship
kinda comes around the corner

18:26.329 --> 18:29.597
into the acoustic field
of that... of the whales.

18:29.598 --> 18:31.900
You can hear what happens.

18:31.901 --> 18:34.169
This is a group of G clan whales.

18:51.223 --> 18:53.058
When a cruise ship comes along,

18:53.059 --> 18:55.166
you can hear what happens.

19:02.574 --> 19:04.776
Anyway, the whales,
uh, are calling away.

19:04.777 --> 19:06.044
And they, uh,

19:06.045 --> 19:08.413
uh, try to continue it
for a little while.

19:08.414 --> 19:12.250
Then they get totally drowned out.

19:12.251 --> 19:14.652
Noise interferes with hunting,

19:14.653 --> 19:18.123
with a whale's ability to find fish.

19:18.124 --> 19:21.259
Well, if you reduce the amount of food

19:21.260 --> 19:23.328
that whales can get,

19:23.329 --> 19:27.233
then you're directly impacting
their well‐being, their lives.

19:31.503 --> 19:33.371
I think when you listen
to the hydrophones,

19:33.372 --> 19:34.706
it's hard to think

19:34.707 --> 19:37.776
that that noise does not have
an impact on the whales.

19:37.777 --> 19:40.611
I mean, sometimes, it...
Listening on the headphones

19:40.612 --> 19:43.281
gives you a headache within 10 minutes.

19:43.282 --> 19:44.682
You have to take the headphones off.

19:44.683 --> 19:46.551
You have to turn the volume down.

19:46.552 --> 19:49.587
And I just think, you know, "the whales,

19:49.588 --> 19:51.824
they can't turn the volume down."

20:02.674 --> 20:04.675
Several years ago, I was at a meeting

20:04.676 --> 20:07.745
about ship noise in Hamburg, Germany.

20:07.746 --> 20:10.448
And we went down and saw
some of the newest

20:10.449 --> 20:12.050
and largest container ships.

20:12.051 --> 20:14.986
And they're striking.

20:14.987 --> 20:17.855
They're basically skyscrapers
turned sideways

20:17.856 --> 20:21.259
with giant engines
put on the back of 'em.

20:21.260 --> 20:23.728
Some of the sound
may come from the engines

20:23.729 --> 20:25.363
that's transmitted through the hull.

20:25.364 --> 20:29.234
But the majority of it comes
from what is happening right

20:29.235 --> 20:31.002
at the propeller.

20:33.572 --> 20:35.406
It's called cavitation.

20:35.407 --> 20:37.275
That's when the bubbles
created by the blades

20:37.276 --> 20:40.946
of the propeller collapse
and burst underwater.

20:40.947 --> 20:44.015
It's not so much the collapse
of an individual bubble.

20:44.016 --> 20:45.683
It's all of them, eh,

20:45.684 --> 20:49.788
at once creating a very loud hiss.

20:52.358 --> 20:55.201
The ship's engines
generate noise as well.

20:56.568 --> 21:00.771
Basically, the way ship engines
are historically built

21:00.772 --> 21:04.009
is you bolt 'em to the frame.

21:04.010 --> 21:07.478
And then it vibrates the frame
and makes that sound transmit

21:07.479 --> 21:09.915
through all the steel or the hull

21:09.916 --> 21:12.650
and out into the water.

21:12.651 --> 21:14.953
Over the last 60 years,

21:14.954 --> 21:18.489
the number of ships moving
over the global surface

21:18.490 --> 21:21.227
of the world has increased dramatically.

21:23.195 --> 21:24.695
You can look at the curves.

21:24.696 --> 21:27.232
And it's just going up
and up and up and up.

21:27.233 --> 21:29.600
It really is just
like a highway, you know,

21:29.601 --> 21:32.370
the Los Angeles freeway
or the long island expressway.

21:32.371 --> 21:35.006
And if you look
at the taillights of those cars,

21:35.007 --> 21:36.975
it would be solid light.

21:36.976 --> 21:40.011
That's the shipping Lane, where,

21:40.012 --> 21:41.947
in this case, the light

21:41.948 --> 21:45.483
is all the noise from all the ships.

21:45.484 --> 21:47.485
Is there any evidence
that all of this noise

21:47.486 --> 21:50.656
is making life difficult
for whales and fishes?

21:54.693 --> 21:57.702
Most of humanity lives
in the Northern hemisphere.

21:57.703 --> 21:59.804
There's a fraction of the percentage

21:59.805 --> 22:02.773
of commercial shipping
in the Southern hemisphere.

22:02.774 --> 22:05.076
Well, we have Southern right whales.

22:05.077 --> 22:07.946
They're cousins
of the Northern right whales.

22:07.947 --> 22:12.550
Those populations are going gangbusters.

22:12.551 --> 22:14.986
But up North, their cousins...

22:14.987 --> 22:17.388
Same kind of habitat, everything else...

22:17.389 --> 22:21.459
They're struggling to get by.

22:21.460 --> 22:23.394
Why is that?

22:23.395 --> 22:25.964
You can say, "how many ships
are going through the area?"

22:25.965 --> 22:27.933
But so what?

22:27.934 --> 22:31.236
How... how do you show
that that has any influence

22:31.237 --> 22:34.272
or any impact or makes any difference?

22:34.273 --> 22:36.441
Well, we really needed
a laboratory for that.

22:36.442 --> 22:38.243
We needed a place
where you could draw a line

22:38.244 --> 22:40.478
around it and ask, "okay.

22:40.479 --> 22:44.082
Within these waters,
what are those contributions?"

22:44.083 --> 22:47.552
Researchers chose
Cape Cod Bay near Boston,

22:47.553 --> 22:51.522
an important habitat
of North Atlantic right whales.

22:51.523 --> 22:57.368
And what was surprising
in that was how bad it was.

22:57.369 --> 23:00.538
You see right whale calls illuminated

23:00.539 --> 23:02.941
like little firefly light.

23:02.942 --> 23:04.910
And then, every so often,

23:04.911 --> 23:07.279
several times a day,
a ship will come in.

23:10.716 --> 23:12.383
Comes in like a flood light.

23:12.384 --> 23:16.222
It obliterates the whale's
ability to hear.

23:18.357 --> 23:21.192
The study revealed that
North Atlantic right whales lost

23:21.193 --> 23:22.527
up to 80 percent

23:22.528 --> 23:24.229
of their ability to hear the songs

23:24.230 --> 23:26.831
of their friends and mates.

23:26.832 --> 23:29.700
That's a really dramatic loss
of space for these animals

23:29.701 --> 23:31.669
during really critical time periods.

23:31.670 --> 23:35.706
It's just ripping
the communicate system apart.

23:35.707 --> 23:37.742
Are they not getting enough to eat?

23:37.743 --> 23:39.344
And are they stressed out?

23:39.345 --> 23:42.547
So there, you get a linkage
to the whole reproductive cycle,

23:42.548 --> 23:45.416
to the whole biology.

23:45.417 --> 23:51.122
There may be 450 of them left
in the entire ocean.

23:51.123 --> 23:55.134
That species is fighting
for its life right now.

24:00.006 --> 24:03.708
I joined the Navy in March, 1967.

24:03.709 --> 24:06.244
I learned how to fly, got my wings.

24:06.245 --> 24:08.413
And got stationed at a Sosus station,

24:08.414 --> 24:12.383
which was sound surveillance, undersea.

24:12.384 --> 24:15.720
The operations were that
you listen to hydrophone systems

24:15.721 --> 24:18.357
in the ocean for enemy submarines.

24:19.491 --> 24:22.260
Sosus...

24:22.261 --> 24:27.332
That name was top‐secret.

24:27.333 --> 24:28.934
Now, in 1991,

24:28.935 --> 24:31.502
the Soviet union was collapsing.

24:31.503 --> 24:35.040
And the U. S. Navy offered up Sosus.

24:35.041 --> 24:36.541
I walk in the building,

24:36.542 --> 24:39.144
High security, the whole thing.

24:39.145 --> 24:43.881
And it's like there are maps
all over the walls.

24:43.882 --> 24:46.117
There's all this machinery.

24:46.118 --> 24:48.987
And the way, I metaphorically
speak of this...

24:48.988 --> 24:52.123
The world I've been living
in fits underneath the head

24:52.124 --> 24:54.592
of a pin in the ocean.

24:54.593 --> 24:58.636
This system,
this is the Hubble telescope.

24:58.637 --> 25:01.572
I can listen anywhere in the ocean

25:01.573 --> 25:04.142
I want to at any time.

25:04.143 --> 25:07.145
Someone says to me, "hey, doc.

25:07.146 --> 25:09.880
You think you could
use this for studying whales?"

25:09.881 --> 25:13.184
And it was, like, "expletive deleted."

25:13.185 --> 25:16.821
"Are you blipping kidding me?"

25:16.822 --> 25:18.623
And it was in that room,

25:18.624 --> 25:21.459
I literally crossed the beams

25:21.460 --> 25:25.430
pointing to a blue whale
singing off of Ireland.

25:25.431 --> 25:28.799
I was listening to it from Virginia.

25:33.672 --> 25:36.908
Since biologists have been
given access to Sosus,

25:36.909 --> 25:39.477
it has become
the single most important tool

25:39.478 --> 25:43.081
for listening to whales ocean‐wide.

25:43.082 --> 25:46.684
This listening system has also
allowed scientist to track

25:46.685 --> 25:48.987
the rise of human‐produced noise

25:48.988 --> 25:52.023
in the ocean over time.

25:52.024 --> 25:53.992
Large commercial shipping

25:53.993 --> 25:56.567
has kind of a rumbling like a distant,

25:56.568 --> 26:01.506
uh, thunderstorm all the time.

26:01.507 --> 26:04.209
When I was in the Navy,
that was just a fact of life

26:04.210 --> 26:07.045
in the '60s, '70s, '80s, '90s

26:07.046 --> 26:09.414
and even today as it...

26:09.415 --> 26:11.983
The noise environment in the ocean

26:11.984 --> 26:14.419
is doubling every 10 years.

26:20.592 --> 26:23.194
There's different ways
that sounds can affect animals.

26:23.195 --> 26:25.997
I mean, there's that underlying
ambient noise level

26:25.998 --> 26:28.199
that's rising and rising
and rising that interferes

26:28.200 --> 26:32.704
with communication
and their movement patterns.

26:32.705 --> 26:34.605
And then there's the more acute,

26:34.606 --> 26:36.875
kind of, traumatic impact of sound.

26:36.876 --> 26:39.577
And that's causing physical damage

26:39.578 --> 26:42.413
or just a really strong
behavioral response.

26:42.414 --> 26:45.383
It's fight or flight.

26:45.384 --> 26:46.718
Basically, all my professional life,

26:46.719 --> 26:49.654
I've been responding
to marine mammal strandings,

26:49.655 --> 26:52.057
Dolphins, whales and seals.

26:52.058 --> 26:53.992
Sometimes, when we think
of a mass stranding,

26:53.993 --> 26:55.126
it's not much animals

26:55.127 --> 26:56.367
throwing themselves on the beach,

26:56.368 --> 26:59.304
but being out of habitat.

26:59.305 --> 27:03.174
One example is in Madagascar in 2008.

27:03.175 --> 27:04.475
As we flew in,

27:04.476 --> 27:06.912
going into this very small,
very rural area,

27:06.913 --> 27:09.680
we asked the pilot
if he would do a tour.

27:09.681 --> 27:13.384
We had been told there were 100
to 200 melon‐headed whales

27:13.385 --> 27:14.853
in an estuary.

27:14.854 --> 27:19.090
They were 65 kilometers away
from the open ocean.

27:19.091 --> 27:20.258
And I think our hearts fell

27:20.259 --> 27:21.692
at that point because we looked at it.

27:21.693 --> 27:23.662
And we said,
"it's a huge distance to go."

27:29.135 --> 27:32.270
Most of the animals
were in pretty tough shape.

27:32.271 --> 27:34.405
They looked thin, dehydrated.

27:34.406 --> 27:36.742
These are animals
that probably were stranding

27:36.743 --> 27:39.044
at some point during the day,
getting sunburned,

27:39.045 --> 27:40.879
abrasions, like, cuts and bruises

27:40.880 --> 27:42.915
from being up in the mangrove swamps.

27:48.487 --> 27:50.388
We herd the whales

27:50.389 --> 27:52.390
just like, uh,
like how we would herd cattle.

27:52.391 --> 27:54.292
We... we move boats the way

27:54.293 --> 27:58.469
you would ride a horse behind cattle.

27:58.470 --> 28:00.238
One right there.

28:00.239 --> 28:05.744
Trying to move these animals
very slowly out into open water.

28:05.745 --> 28:07.545
As the day would wear on,

28:07.546 --> 28:08.947
you could just see them deteriorating.

28:08.948 --> 28:11.382
They were becoming slower,
less responsive

28:11.383 --> 28:13.351
to what we were trying to do.

28:13.352 --> 28:16.422
In the end, we probably
saved a handful of whales.

28:18.690 --> 28:20.259
Most of them died.

28:22.294 --> 28:23.795
And then our job was to go in

28:23.796 --> 28:25.965
and figure out why they were there.

28:30.139 --> 28:32.540
In the end, we probably
saved a handful of whales.

28:33.141 --> 28:35.809
Most of them died.

28:36.010 --> 28:37.144
And then our job was to go in

28:37.145 --> 28:39.146
and figure out why they were there.

28:39.147 --> 28:40.548
These animals weren't sick.

28:40.549 --> 28:41.849
They weren't injured.

28:41.850 --> 28:45.419
We ruled out the things
that we knew it wasn't.

28:45.420 --> 28:48.221
And the only smoking gun left

28:48.222 --> 28:51.358
was this oil and gas exploration work

28:51.359 --> 28:53.233
being done offshore that coincided

28:53.234 --> 28:57.337
in time and location with this event.

28:57.338 --> 28:58.506
Prospecting teams,

28:58.507 --> 29:01.174
commissioned by
an Exxonmobil subsidiary,

29:01.175 --> 29:03.877
were hunting for oil
off the coast of Madagascar,

29:03.878 --> 29:06.146
near the mouth of the river.

29:06.147 --> 29:09.350
They were using a special
industrial echo sounder

29:09.351 --> 29:11.719
that emits sound waves
to map the sea floor.

29:14.155 --> 29:16.557
Exxonmobil stopped all of
the work that they were doing.

29:16.558 --> 29:20.328
And they provided volumes of data.

29:20.329 --> 29:22.663
When I was reading through all
of it, one thing caught my eye.

29:22.664 --> 29:25.366
And it was a series
of satellite photographs

29:25.367 --> 29:26.600
of this region.

29:26.601 --> 29:30.271
And they were claiming
these images showed

29:30.272 --> 29:32.473
that there were animals
stranded prior to the work

29:32.474 --> 29:35.676
that they were doing offshore,
so they couldn't have caused it.

29:35.677 --> 29:37.878
In the images,
there were these dark objects

29:37.879 --> 29:41.014
lined up perpendicular to the water.

29:41.015 --> 29:42.916
And they were claiming

29:42.917 --> 29:44.785
that these were all whales
that had stranded.

29:44.786 --> 29:46.587
And I'm looking at 'em, like...
I've been doing strandings

29:46.588 --> 29:47.788
for almost 20 years.

29:47.789 --> 29:49.757
And I've never seen animals
beach themselves

29:49.758 --> 29:53.701
in such a perfect pattern.

29:53.702 --> 29:55.404
And I was like, "those are boats."

29:57.406 --> 30:00.107
Those are dugout canoes
used by local fishermen.

30:00.108 --> 30:02.243
That was the moment that...
That I got really angry.

30:02.244 --> 30:03.844
And I was, like, "you know,
now you're just...

30:03.845 --> 30:06.046
There's no way you can believe that."

30:06.047 --> 30:07.481
They were throwing everything at us

30:07.482 --> 30:08.516
to say it couldn't have been us.

30:08.517 --> 30:10.318
And I looked at that and I said, "no.

30:10.319 --> 30:12.786
There's no way."

30:12.787 --> 30:15.456
An independent scientific review panel

30:15.457 --> 30:19.026
came to the same conclusion
as Moore and her team.

30:19.027 --> 30:21.862
The whales were most likely
trying to escape the noise

30:21.863 --> 30:24.098
of the industrial echo sounder.

30:27.902 --> 30:30.804
But fossil fuel companies
are doing much more

30:30.805 --> 30:34.775
than just mapping the ocean
with waves of sound.

30:34.776 --> 30:36.444
More and more and more,
what you're seeing

30:36.445 --> 30:41.515
is deep ocean prospecting
for oil and gas.

30:41.516 --> 30:44.117
So the modern form of dynamite

30:44.118 --> 30:47.556
is found in the form of airguns...

30:54.669 --> 30:58.338
Most of which goes
vertically down into the ocean.

30:58.339 --> 31:00.841
It reflects off the Earth's crust.

31:00.842 --> 31:03.711
And then you create an image
of the composition of the Earth,

31:03.712 --> 31:06.313
and you search for oil and gas.

31:06.314 --> 31:08.348
And then you have sets of them,

31:08.349 --> 31:10.451
10, 20, 30, 40 of them in a...

31:10.452 --> 31:11.652
What's called an array.

31:11.653 --> 31:13.787
It's a big matrix of them behind a ship.

31:13.788 --> 31:16.957
And they all explode simultaneously.

31:16.958 --> 31:20.060
And there are multiple surveys,
all setting off these charges

31:20.061 --> 31:21.929
at a regular rate of 10 seconds

31:21.930 --> 31:23.363
or 12 seconds.

31:23.364 --> 31:26.700
And the survey goes on
for months at a time.

31:26.701 --> 31:28.436
If you were listening in the ocean,

31:28.437 --> 31:30.871
you could hear the regular
explosions of these sounds

31:30.872 --> 31:33.173
coming from Africa, South America,

31:33.174 --> 31:35.342
Great Britain, Canada.

31:35.343 --> 31:41.014
And now it's also
invading into the Arctic.

31:41.015 --> 31:42.483
Airguns have been shown to have

31:42.484 --> 31:46.286
an enormous environmental footprint.

31:46.287 --> 31:48.989
In baleen whales, the great whales,

31:48.990 --> 31:51.925
they have been shown to silence animals.

31:51.926 --> 31:55.469
They've been shown
to cause animals to flee, uh,

31:55.470 --> 31:59.206
large areas of habitat.

31:59.207 --> 32:02.175
The areas we're talking about
are enormous... in some cases,

32:02.176 --> 32:03.877
documented over literally

32:03.878 --> 32:06.614
hundreds of thousands of...
of square miles.

32:14.088 --> 32:18.125
These companies are able
to take resources

32:18.126 --> 32:20.360
from the global commons...

32:20.361 --> 32:22.630
Hydrocarbons, in this case...

32:22.631 --> 32:24.632
And exploit those

32:24.633 --> 32:30.871
and damage the ocean ecosystem
without cost.

32:30.872 --> 32:34.876
That, to me, is intolerable.

32:39.080 --> 32:42.115
The sound of seismic
prospecting for oil and gas

32:42.116 --> 32:44.552
is changing life in the oceans.

32:44.553 --> 32:46.319
But it's also changing life for people

32:46.320 --> 32:49.458
who depend on the oceans,
living on land.

32:52.093 --> 32:55.068
This coast has made

32:55.069 --> 32:59.973
thousands of generations
able to survive.

32:59.974 --> 33:05.413
All my relatives
before me lived from this.

33:05.414 --> 33:08.082
I've been a fisherman for many years.

33:18.159 --> 33:21.962
What is happening now
is a disaster to us.

33:21.963 --> 33:26.967
Oil industry is hunting oil
and gas on our fishing grounds.

33:29.037 --> 33:32.105
Catches immediately were reduced

33:32.106 --> 33:35.075
by 60 percent.

33:35.076 --> 33:36.844
This was massive.

33:36.845 --> 33:39.480
And this was clearly
the seismic shootings,

33:39.481 --> 33:41.682
the blastings.

33:41.683 --> 33:45.385
Then, after some time,
not coming back...

33:45.386 --> 33:47.855
It's not coming back.
Why is that so?

33:47.856 --> 33:48.922
It should come back

33:48.923 --> 33:51.592
if everything was normal in the sea.

33:51.593 --> 33:54.101
If this is going to... to go on,

33:54.102 --> 33:56.269
those blastings in the sea,

33:56.270 --> 33:58.472
in all the world's sea,

33:58.473 --> 34:00.508
we are going to kill ourselves
in the end.

34:00.509 --> 34:03.944
Because we are killing our food.

34:03.945 --> 34:06.179
This is happening all around...
around the world.

34:06.180 --> 34:08.681
We know it.
But we...

34:08.683 --> 34:11.853
It seems like we are not able
to do anything about it.

34:13.324 --> 34:14.726
We've been successful before

34:15.127 --> 34:17.161
in acting to protect the health
of the oceans

34:17.762 --> 34:20.764
and the largest animals on Earth.

34:20.965 --> 34:23.366
There was a time when the oil of whales

34:23.367 --> 34:27.570
was the natural resource
used to fuel our world.

34:27.571 --> 34:29.973
The great whales were literally pushed

34:29.974 --> 34:31.908
to the brink of extinction

34:31.909 --> 34:33.744
when everything was fair game.

34:33.745 --> 34:35.646
It was a total horror story.

34:35.847 --> 34:38.313
What happened in the early 20th century

34:38.315 --> 34:41.150
is that that practice
became industrialized.

34:41.152 --> 34:44.554
Whalers started using
large factory ships.

34:44.554 --> 34:48.491
And they began decimating populations.

34:48.492 --> 34:50.766
The consequences of human consumption

34:50.766 --> 34:53.103
were apparent to legendary oceanographer

34:53.103 --> 34:56.572
Jacques Cousteau, who battled
against commercial whaling.

34:56.572 --> 34:59.675
Most countries agreed to stop
whaling in the 1980s,

34:59.676 --> 35:03.479
and some whale populations
have rebounded since then.

35:03.480 --> 35:07.117
Jacques' son, Jean‐Michel,
driven by a similar passion

35:07.118 --> 35:09.953
for the oceans and the largest
animals on Earth,

35:09.954 --> 35:12.256
continues his father's legacy.

35:14.859 --> 35:16.359
My father, when I was a kid,

35:16.360 --> 35:18.361
created a movie, very well‐known,

35:18.362 --> 35:22.198
which has put the ocean
in everybody's home,

35:22.199 --> 35:24.101
called "the silent world."

35:30.707 --> 35:32.575
Well, it was pretty silent then.

35:32.576 --> 35:36.246
The big difference
between the past and today

35:36.247 --> 35:40.016
is that we've created a lot of noise.

35:40.017 --> 35:43.487
I wish we were making music,
but we're not.

35:45.289 --> 35:46.756
When you're in a place

35:46.757 --> 35:49.525
where there may be whales and dolphins,

35:49.526 --> 35:51.968
put a mask on with a snorkel.

35:51.969 --> 35:55.305
Go in 5 feet of water

35:55.306 --> 35:58.741
and close your eyes and listen.

36:01.445 --> 36:03.247
It's fascinating.

36:06.483 --> 36:11.721
My first real encounter
with a whale was in Patagonia.

36:11.722 --> 36:15.258
The first time I saw a really,
really friendly humpback whale

36:15.259 --> 36:17.127
was at silver bank, Dominican Republic.

36:17.128 --> 36:21.797
It was three humpback whales in Hawaii.

36:21.798 --> 36:24.868
When we first came to Hanson island,

36:24.869 --> 36:26.702
we brought a little kayak along with us.

36:26.703 --> 36:30.073
And I started paddling around
with the whales

36:30.074 --> 36:32.843
to see if I could understand
more about them.

36:32.844 --> 36:35.812
We had two guys onboard.

36:35.813 --> 36:38.348
They were just, sort of,
like, space cadets.

36:38.349 --> 36:41.117
One of 'em was a... a Vietnam vet

36:41.118 --> 36:43.753
that had been shot
I don't know how many times.

36:43.754 --> 36:45.321
And had... every bone in his body

36:45.322 --> 36:47.924
had some kinda metal plate or shrapnel.

36:47.925 --> 36:49.926
Anyway, he just wanted
to see a whale, you know?

36:49.927 --> 36:51.634
And we're telling him, "well,
you're on the wrong trip, guy.

36:51.635 --> 36:53.202
We're not gonna get near one."

36:53.203 --> 36:55.972
Big fog bank came in and surrounded me.

36:55.973 --> 36:58.507
And I got totally lost.

36:58.508 --> 36:59.775
I didn't know what to do.

36:59.776 --> 37:01.110
I didn't know where the whales were.

37:01.111 --> 37:02.411
I didn't know where I was.

37:02.412 --> 37:05.314
The current was taking me.

37:05.315 --> 37:06.850
I had my flute onboard.

37:06.851 --> 37:09.385
And I picked up my flute
and started play,

37:09.386 --> 37:11.387
probably to calm me down.

37:11.388 --> 37:14.524
And after a few minutes,
uh, the whales came by.

37:14.525 --> 37:16.792
As they were moving,
they were coming toward me.

37:16.793 --> 37:18.862
They could've gone somewhere else.

37:18.863 --> 37:20.496
They knew I was there.

37:20.497 --> 37:23.934
And all of a sudden, I felt
something under my flippers.

37:23.935 --> 37:25.435
And then the whale came under the boat

37:25.436 --> 37:27.237
and the first mate was freaking out,

37:27.238 --> 37:29.105
like they're all gonna die.

37:29.106 --> 37:31.975
And just lifted me out of the water.

37:31.976 --> 37:35.145
Whale lifted the boat
up on its back and, you know,

37:35.146 --> 37:36.679
it was clear out of the water.

37:36.680 --> 37:38.648
I put down my flute
and picked up the paddle

37:38.649 --> 37:40.550
and started following them.

37:40.551 --> 37:43.820
And, uh, after a little while,
I got lost again.

37:43.821 --> 37:46.122
So I stopped paddling
and picked up my flute

37:46.123 --> 37:47.790
and started playing it.

37:47.791 --> 37:49.867
And they came back around me again.

37:56.140 --> 37:59.509
And I dove down,

37:59.510 --> 38:00.911
and I looked her in the eye.

38:00.912 --> 38:02.979
We were looking at each other.

38:02.980 --> 38:05.681
When you look in the eyes
of a whale, uh,

38:05.682 --> 38:07.717
they're actually looking...

38:07.718 --> 38:10.453
They're seeing your soul, you know?

38:10.454 --> 38:13.624
And if you're perceptive,
you'll see their soul.

38:19.730 --> 38:21.764
And I reached out and touched her.

38:21.765 --> 38:23.733
I could have touched them.

38:23.734 --> 38:27.838
Took its flipper, and just...

38:27.839 --> 38:30.573
Laid it on the head of this guy

38:30.574 --> 38:33.409
from... you know, the guy
that was all shot up.

38:33.410 --> 38:34.777
You know, he was just so excited.

38:34.778 --> 38:35.778
He was sitting there playing

38:35.779 --> 38:37.580
with the barnacles and stuff on it.

38:37.581 --> 38:39.682
And... and the first mate was thinking,

38:39.683 --> 38:42.318
well, he's gonna get
his head chopped off.

38:42.319 --> 38:46.289
When you are little wee, wee
diver there,

38:46.290 --> 38:48.324
they know you're there.

38:48.325 --> 38:51.935
They flip them and fold them back.

38:51.936 --> 38:56.907
Because they're totally aware
of your presence.

38:56.908 --> 38:59.010
And they don't wanna hurt you.

39:01.345 --> 39:03.980
Finally, uh, I came to an island

39:03.981 --> 39:05.381
that loomed up out of the fog,

39:05.382 --> 39:08.551
and landed and waited
until the fog cleared.

39:08.552 --> 39:10.987
And I would say, one of the...

39:10.988 --> 39:13.857
One of the profound experiences I had...

39:13.858 --> 39:16.059
To me, these are some of the most, uh,

39:16.060 --> 39:18.394
emotional experiences I've had.

39:18.395 --> 39:19.830
That was it.
I was in love.

39:19.831 --> 39:21.797
Right?
It was... that was it.

39:31.909 --> 39:33.409
I was listening to the noise

39:33.410 --> 39:36.246
that sea mammals and fish
are all subjected to,

39:36.247 --> 39:37.680
which was painful to me.

39:37.681 --> 39:40.783
I... I can see that it would...
it would cause a...

39:40.784 --> 39:43.553
A psychosis, you know?

39:43.554 --> 39:45.356
Day after day...

39:48.159 --> 39:51.802
Hearing really developed
as an animal detection system,

39:51.803 --> 39:56.172
the primary means
of establishing an alert

39:56.173 --> 39:58.508
that you had to get away,
get away quickly.

39:58.509 --> 40:01.477
Because really, it was a matter
of flight or hide is...

40:01.478 --> 40:03.980
Were your only modes of survival.

40:03.981 --> 40:08.151
Our system's stress in response to noise

40:08.152 --> 40:11.554
comes from this environmentally
animal necessity

40:11.555 --> 40:12.989
of avoiding a threat.

40:12.990 --> 40:16.993
So we hear sirens on the street...

40:16.994 --> 40:18.862
Every one of those sirens,
it can be shown,

40:18.863 --> 40:21.397
you're going to get
some elevation in heart rate,

40:21.398 --> 40:25.035
some vasoconstriction,
release of stress hormones.

40:25.036 --> 40:28.304
All of these different stress
markers happen to you.

40:28.305 --> 40:33.343
So we're getting this barrage of stress

40:33.344 --> 40:35.045
even when we don't perceive it as such.

40:35.046 --> 40:37.180
If you've ever been

40:37.181 --> 40:39.515
in an incredibly loud club

40:39.516 --> 40:41.251
or a loud party or a loud restaurant,

40:41.252 --> 40:42.652
and there was a moment when you actually

40:42.653 --> 40:44.988
felt vertigo and nausea

40:44.989 --> 40:46.289
because you didn't think

40:46.290 --> 40:48.424
that you could survive
there another moment,

40:48.425 --> 40:50.167
and you burst out the door...

40:53.938 --> 40:55.939
Imagine what it is for
these marine species

40:55.940 --> 40:58.875
that have no door
to pass through to get away.

40:58.876 --> 41:00.744
There's nowhere to go.

41:06.783 --> 41:09.319
Few years ago, there were
a group of researchers

41:09.320 --> 41:11.254
who had been taking fecal samples

41:11.255 --> 41:14.257
of North Atlantic right whales.

41:14.258 --> 41:16.759
They saw something really funny

41:16.760 --> 41:20.063
in their data taken from 2001.

41:20.064 --> 41:24.701
Those fecal samples registered
fewer and fewer stress hormones.

41:26.203 --> 41:27.737
They looked more closely

41:27.738 --> 41:30.874
and they found that their samples

41:30.875 --> 41:32.775
seemed to turn around
at a particular date.

41:32.776 --> 41:40.217
And that was September 11th.

41:44.758 --> 41:46.124
After September 11th,

41:46.125 --> 41:49.268
there was a halt
to so much of shipping traffic.

41:49.269 --> 41:52.238
And that fall in shipping traffic

41:52.239 --> 41:57.175
seemed to correlate with a dramatic fall

41:57.176 --> 41:59.312
in stress hormones in right whales.

41:59.313 --> 42:01.780
They didn't see this in any other year.

42:01.781 --> 42:04.850
There's a direct,
significant correlation

42:04.851 --> 42:07.520
between the amount of ship noise

42:07.521 --> 42:08.687
and the physiology

42:08.688 --> 42:13.058
and the stress levels in these animals.

42:13.059 --> 42:15.828
It's a devastating finding.

42:15.829 --> 42:19.031
It's shocking
because it's so measurable,

42:19.032 --> 42:21.801
what was found
in the wake of the attacks.

42:27.274 --> 42:29.742
One of the first things
they teach you at,

42:29.743 --> 42:31.677
uh, the naval officer academy

42:31.678 --> 42:34.880
is he who rules the ocean,

42:34.881 --> 42:37.883
rules the world.

42:37.884 --> 42:39.719
And it's true.

42:43.156 --> 42:46.158
I talked a friend
into going for a flight

42:46.159 --> 42:48.634
the following morning of the stranding.

42:48.635 --> 42:52.104
We searched around
and found more specimens.

42:52.105 --> 42:55.808
But we also saw military ships,

42:55.809 --> 42:57.210
U.S. Navy destroyer

42:57.211 --> 43:00.513
and some other warships.

43:00.514 --> 43:03.917
So then I just put the two
and two together.

43:06.786 --> 43:09.288
The missing piece
of the puzzle for Ken balcomb

43:09.289 --> 43:11.023
was the U. S. Navy,

43:11.024 --> 43:12.658
an institution he had served in

43:12.659 --> 43:16.462
with distinction
during his early career.

43:16.463 --> 43:19.298
The warships were bouncing their sonars

43:19.299 --> 43:23.136
with very high intensity
and frequency sound.

43:26.806 --> 43:31.109
A screeching tone is hard to listen to.

43:31.110 --> 43:35.248
It's just overpowering.

43:35.249 --> 43:37.316
I can't imagine anything more absurd

43:37.317 --> 43:41.321
than dropping acoustic bombs
in downtown cities.

43:42.756 --> 43:44.624
It's... it's equivalent.

43:46.760 --> 43:48.901
Naval warships use a technique

43:48.902 --> 43:51.169
that mimics the natural abilities

43:51.170 --> 43:53.171
of whales and dolphins.

43:53.172 --> 43:56.275
They'll send out a click

43:56.276 --> 43:58.977
and listen for the echo off a target,

43:58.978 --> 44:00.313
and know how far away it is

44:00.314 --> 44:04.016
and how fast it's moving
and even what kinda target.

44:04.017 --> 44:06.685
Sonar is the principal
submarine detection system

44:06.686 --> 44:07.953
used by the U. S. Navy

44:07.954 --> 44:10.257
and other navies of the world.

44:13.793 --> 44:16.194
Joel Reynolds has spent
much of his career

44:16.195 --> 44:19.299
fighting in the courts
to protect the oceans.

44:22.536 --> 44:26.439
The Navy developed
something called active sonar.

44:26.440 --> 44:28.507
And this is the system
that they use to protect

44:28.508 --> 44:32.379
our massive aircraft carriers
with 5,000 sailors on them.

44:35.882 --> 44:37.516
In its simplest terms,

44:37.517 --> 44:40.853
it involves generating
extremely loud sound underwater

44:40.854 --> 44:42.589
to detect targets.

44:46.092 --> 44:47.900
It's in a sweep.

44:47.901 --> 44:50.636
So when the sweep
is pointed right at you,

44:50.637 --> 44:53.539
you get the full intensity of it.

44:53.540 --> 44:57.543
And then, about a minute
later, it does it again.

44:57.544 --> 44:59.845
We began to investigate.

44:59.846 --> 45:02.147
We learned that they had no permits.

45:02.148 --> 45:04.417
They'd done no environmental reviews.

45:04.418 --> 45:06.485
There were no safeguards,

45:06.486 --> 45:07.886
uh, built into the program

45:07.887 --> 45:11.224
to protect the marine environment.

45:11.225 --> 45:14.627
The impact of active sonar
on whales and dolphins

45:14.628 --> 45:17.530
has been clearly documented
in the Bahamas case

45:17.531 --> 45:21.567
and others where animals
have been killed.

45:21.568 --> 45:25.170
When biologists have
studied their bodies,

45:25.171 --> 45:29.975
they have seen an array
of very disturbing pathologies.

45:29.976 --> 45:32.245
Bleeding around the brain, uh,

45:32.246 --> 45:34.247
lesions in organ tissue,

45:34.248 --> 45:36.382
all consistent with,

45:36.383 --> 45:39.586
uh, decompression sickness or the bends.

45:42.589 --> 45:47.092
Divers know that they have
to surface gradually, uh,

45:47.093 --> 45:50.002
when they're ending a dive.

45:50.003 --> 45:53.439
Otherwise, nitrogen
can build up in the blood

45:53.440 --> 45:57.410
to the point where it damages the body.

45:57.411 --> 45:58.877
That is precisely

45:58.878 --> 46:02.915
what seems to be
happening to beaked whales.

46:02.916 --> 46:05.518
They're deep‐water animals,

46:05.519 --> 46:08.487
all of a sudden
they just leave the water.

46:08.488 --> 46:10.724
And now they can't decompress.

46:12.759 --> 46:14.827
After the Bahamas strandings occurred,

46:14.828 --> 46:17.330
the Navy denied it was involved.

46:17.331 --> 46:19.432
It took the better part of 2 years

46:19.433 --> 46:21.967
for it to admit culpability.

46:21.968 --> 46:23.536
The chief of naval operations,

46:23.537 --> 46:24.970
the head guy,

46:24.971 --> 46:27.340
was convinced, finally,

46:27.341 --> 46:30.809
that, uh, yeah, that it's their fault.

46:30.810 --> 46:32.579
They did it.

46:35.982 --> 46:37.916
There are many other navies in the world

46:37.917 --> 46:39.985
that use this same kind of technology

46:39.986 --> 46:42.120
to detect submarines.

46:42.121 --> 46:45.391
Many of them follow our lead, of course.

46:45.392 --> 46:49.368
It's a global problem
in its truest sense.

46:49.369 --> 46:51.904
Probably the most visible effect

46:51.905 --> 46:53.672
of ocean noise, uh,

46:53.673 --> 46:56.775
has been this series of mass strandings

46:56.776 --> 47:00.313
of whales on the beaches
around the world.

47:00.314 --> 47:02.381
Time and again, in the Bahamas,

47:02.382 --> 47:06.118
in the canary islands,
off Spain, off Greece,

47:06.119 --> 47:11.590
they have turned up along the coast.

47:11.591 --> 47:14.827
The Navy was acting lawlessly
for years, uh,

47:14.828 --> 47:18.564
before we started taking them to court.

47:18.565 --> 47:22.535
It's not an easy thing to...
to fight the U. S. Navy.

47:22.536 --> 47:25.170
I think a lot of us look at the Navy

47:25.171 --> 47:27.406
as people acting in the public interest.

47:27.407 --> 47:30.042
And it's a little painful
to have to go after them.

47:30.043 --> 47:32.010
But once we did, uh,

47:32.011 --> 47:33.979
they started doing
environmental reviews.

47:33.980 --> 47:36.048
They started getting permits.

47:36.049 --> 47:38.050
They started a research program

47:38.051 --> 47:40.986
which is now the largest source

47:40.987 --> 47:45.157
of marine mammal research funds,
probably, on the planet.

47:45.158 --> 47:49.802
The trick is to get the Navy
to move beyond research.

47:49.803 --> 47:51.404
We're at the point

47:51.405 --> 47:53.372
where we know enough to say

47:53.373 --> 47:55.408
that the Navy has to do more

47:55.409 --> 47:58.411
to reduce harm from its exercises.

47:58.412 --> 48:00.479
We don't believe
there's an inconsistency

48:00.480 --> 48:04.317
between defending the United States

48:04.318 --> 48:06.219
and protecting the environment.

48:06.220 --> 48:10.357
Whales and other marine life
should not die for practice.

48:13.327 --> 48:15.861
Three years after the Bahamas stranding,

48:15.862 --> 48:17.730
Ken balcomb was watching orcas

48:17.731 --> 48:21.199
from his new home in Washington state.

48:21.200 --> 48:24.270
The ship was about 3 miles out.

48:24.271 --> 48:28.041
It was just, like, deja vu
of the Bahamas.

48:34.083 --> 48:36.718
Three years after the Bahamas stranding,

48:36.719 --> 48:38.486
Ken balcomb was watching orcas

48:38.487 --> 48:41.389
from his new home in Washington state.

48:41.390 --> 48:45.400
It was just, like,
deja vu of the Bahamas.

48:45.401 --> 48:48.804
Uh, I was just dumbfounded.

48:48.805 --> 48:50.571
Yeah.

49:02.551 --> 49:04.419
Shut the damn thing off.

49:11.193 --> 49:14.395
Before the ship
started utilizing its sonar,

49:14.396 --> 49:16.364
the whales were feeding at salmon bank,

49:16.365 --> 49:18.433
south end of this island.

49:18.434 --> 49:20.201
Something very unusual was happening.

49:20.202 --> 49:22.671
All the whales
gathered together in groups

49:22.672 --> 49:25.573
and went very close to the shore.

49:25.574 --> 49:27.242
We started seeing every porpoise.

49:27.243 --> 49:29.845
They were all just streaking,

49:29.846 --> 49:32.948
as fast as they could go,
away from the sound.

49:32.949 --> 49:37.085
And a minke whale was going
away from the sound.

49:37.086 --> 49:39.955
Navy sonar is like an enormous predator.

49:39.956 --> 49:43.925
When whales hear it,
some go silent, stop foraging

49:43.926 --> 49:47.035
and abandon their habitat.

49:47.036 --> 49:52.007
Repeated exposure to sonar
can harm whole populations.

49:52.008 --> 49:54.876
You didn't have to have
a hydrophone to hear the sonar.

49:54.877 --> 49:59.380
It was virtually unbearable
for us on the porch.

49:59.381 --> 50:03.484
I can't imagine what it must've
been like underwater.

50:03.485 --> 50:06.688
In the following days, 11 porpoises

50:06.689 --> 50:10.458
were found on the beach, dead.

50:10.459 --> 50:13.695
You know, one of the complaints
from an admiral was that,

50:13.696 --> 50:17.633
"well, you know,
we can't worry about the fish."

50:17.634 --> 50:20.101
Nobody comes in the Navy,
that I know of,

50:20.102 --> 50:22.904
to say they wanna hurt a whale.

50:22.905 --> 50:24.773
When I was in the Navy, I had the honor

50:24.774 --> 50:26.708
of commanding 3 warships...

50:26.709 --> 50:28.944
The commodore of 13 warships

50:28.945 --> 50:34.249
and then chief of staff
of naval surface forces.

50:34.250 --> 50:38.419
If you know that there is
a whale in the area,

50:38.420 --> 50:40.121
unless you're at war,

50:40.122 --> 50:43.224
you're... you're trying
to avoid using those sonars.

50:46.135 --> 50:49.304
Mid‐frequency sonar can be pretty loud.

50:49.305 --> 50:53.441
Putting sound in the water
can have an impact

50:53.442 --> 50:57.212
upon whales and other mammals
that inhabit the ocean.

50:57.213 --> 50:59.815
It's also important to understand

50:59.816 --> 51:03.451
that what the sound is looking for

51:03.452 --> 51:05.621
are a potential enemy

51:05.622 --> 51:08.790
whose intent is to kill sailors

51:08.791 --> 51:11.326
and destroy our ships.

51:11.327 --> 51:12.527
What's at stake

51:12.528 --> 51:15.330
if we are not good
at anti‐submarine warfare

51:15.331 --> 51:17.232
is not only the threat

51:17.233 --> 51:19.801
of loss of life of America's
sons and daughters

51:19.802 --> 51:21.269
and our friends and allies,

51:21.270 --> 51:24.172
but also those capital ships
that we invest in.

51:24.173 --> 51:25.741
Ships are expensive,

51:25.742 --> 51:28.043
and obviously human beings
can't be replaced.

51:28.044 --> 51:31.781
So we have to be very good
at anti‐submarine warfare.

51:33.149 --> 51:35.516
I don't believe that National Security

51:35.517 --> 51:38.754
and Environmental Protection
are inconsistent at all.

51:38.755 --> 51:41.389
I think there has to be an accommodation

51:41.390 --> 51:43.591
between those two principles,

51:43.592 --> 51:46.167
where the Navy can operate in a way

51:46.168 --> 51:49.537
that has the minimal impact
upon the environment

51:49.538 --> 51:52.007
and still perform its training

51:52.008 --> 51:54.043
and, if necessary, its mission.

51:58.280 --> 52:02.017
We all value security.

52:02.018 --> 52:05.086
We have to think of security,
however, in the broader terms

52:05.087 --> 52:07.856
of what we're doing
to our life support system.

52:07.857 --> 52:10.425
And that means considering
life in the ocean

52:10.426 --> 52:13.194
as a part of what makes
our lives possible.

52:22.872 --> 52:25.440
We can't support the human population,

52:25.441 --> 52:28.376
at the rate we're growing,

52:28.377 --> 52:31.079
with a diminishing ecosystem.

52:37.687 --> 52:39.487
And they're the sentinels
of whether or not

52:39.488 --> 52:41.389
it's healthy out there.

52:41.390 --> 52:45.300
Killing 'em off is not sensible.

52:45.301 --> 52:47.703
The typical mode
that we all have is status quo.

52:47.704 --> 52:49.871
It's easier, in some ways,
not to do anything

52:49.872 --> 52:52.273
than it is do something.

52:52.274 --> 52:54.375
So, we are at this tipping point.

52:54.376 --> 52:57.212
This is a problem that we can solve.

52:57.213 --> 52:59.848
The question is whether we have
the political will to solve it.

52:59.849 --> 53:03.518
That's really what it comes down to.

53:03.519 --> 53:06.221
I attended a shipping
conference not long ago

53:06.222 --> 53:09.424
where the organizers started
the conference by saying,

53:09.425 --> 53:12.293
"if only we knew 50 years ago

53:12.294 --> 53:15.631
what we know today
about sound in the ocean,

53:15.632 --> 53:18.033
we could design propellers

53:18.034 --> 53:22.270
that are not only much quieter,
but are more efficient."

53:22.271 --> 53:24.640
Designing a quieter ship

53:24.641 --> 53:27.575
will result in
increased fuel efficiency,

53:27.576 --> 53:30.578
which is reduced cost to the owner.

53:30.579 --> 53:32.848
We're talking about ships
that have fuel costs,

53:32.849 --> 53:34.515
on a per‐vessel basis,

53:34.516 --> 53:36.618
tens of millions of dollars a year.

53:36.619 --> 53:38.954
So, designing more efficient vessels

53:38.955 --> 53:41.289
just makes a whole lot of sense.

53:41.290 --> 53:43.959
It is in the U. S. Navy's best interest

53:43.960 --> 53:47.669
to be as quiet as possible
when we operate at sea.

53:47.670 --> 53:49.771
Hull forms are changing dramatically

53:49.772 --> 53:51.873
over the last several decades.

53:51.874 --> 53:53.508
And you can just look out and see

53:53.509 --> 53:56.377
that you have
more catamaran‐shaped hulls,

53:56.378 --> 54:00.181
where you have less metal
actually in the water.

54:00.182 --> 54:02.117
And so that is reducing the sound

54:02.118 --> 54:03.719
and also reduces the friction,

54:03.720 --> 54:07.588
which means that it's
more fuel‐efficient and quieter.

54:07.589 --> 54:11.359
Researchers and Navies
have been modifying their ships

54:11.360 --> 54:14.062
to reduce noise for... for years.

54:14.063 --> 54:16.564
Commercial ships can reduce the noise

54:16.565 --> 54:20.035
that they put in the water
by some 90 percent.

54:20.036 --> 54:22.838
That's significant.

54:22.839 --> 54:26.642
Another way to reduce the noise
is go a little slower.

54:26.643 --> 54:28.910
Chris Clark also advocates

54:28.911 --> 54:30.612
speed limits for cargo ships

54:30.613 --> 54:32.848
as well as rerouting shipping lanes

54:32.849 --> 54:35.416
where they are clearly
impacting habitats.

54:35.417 --> 54:38.453
The average waiting time for a ship

54:38.454 --> 54:40.088
when it gets to port,

54:40.089 --> 54:42.724
before it unloads its cargo,

54:42.725 --> 54:44.225
is 3 days.

54:44.226 --> 54:47.535
Wouldn't it make sense
to maybe go a little slower

54:47.536 --> 54:50.338
and save billions of dollars
in fuel costs?

54:50.339 --> 54:53.208
And then when you get to shore
you have a very efficient system

54:53.209 --> 54:55.043
of getting your cargo off the ship,

54:55.044 --> 54:57.613
rather than sitting there for 3 days.

54:57.614 --> 55:01.282
So reducing noise could be
a win‐win‐win.

55:01.283 --> 55:05.586
A win for marine mammals having
to deal with noise in the ocean.

55:05.587 --> 55:08.056
A win for the climate and for humans

55:08.057 --> 55:09.891
who have to deal with air pollution.

55:09.892 --> 55:11.392
And even a...

55:11.393 --> 55:14.096
A win for industry, saving money
over the life of a ship.

55:19.404 --> 55:21.472
In terms of human life,
there is a threat

55:21.473 --> 55:25.009
that they have to prepare for
and then practice for.

55:25.010 --> 55:27.278
I think they should avoid the problems.

55:27.279 --> 55:29.247
And you avoid 'em by not practicing

55:29.248 --> 55:32.950
in where you know sensitive animals are.

55:32.951 --> 55:35.986
Breeding areas, feeding areas,
migratory routes...

55:35.987 --> 55:39.557
When there are animals present,
test someplace else.

55:43.402 --> 55:47.005
We are searching harder every day

55:47.006 --> 55:51.075
for more and more oil everywhere.

55:51.076 --> 55:52.843
So if there are... there is a technology

55:52.844 --> 55:54.778
to make it less, uh,

55:54.779 --> 55:57.948
abusive to the... to the Sonic World,

55:57.949 --> 55:59.583
then we should...
We should embrace that,

55:59.584 --> 56:01.085
no matter what the cost.

56:01.086 --> 56:03.321
Are there alternative technologies,

56:03.322 --> 56:06.390
other than setting off
a bomb every 9 seconds,

56:06.391 --> 56:08.459
that are available to us today?

56:08.460 --> 56:11.229
And the answer is, you bet there are.

56:11.230 --> 56:15.733
And you can be profoundly
quieter than the explosion.

56:15.734 --> 56:17.935
For example,
there's an emerging technology

56:17.936 --> 56:21.872
called marine vibroseis that
doesn't produce an explosion.

56:21.873 --> 56:25.243
It produces a continuous,
very low‐frequency sound

56:25.244 --> 56:29.247
that is thousands of times less
intense and less invasive

56:29.248 --> 56:31.049
than an explosion.

56:31.050 --> 56:35.253
And it also produces
a much higher resolution image

56:35.254 --> 56:36.754
of the Earth.

56:36.755 --> 56:38.256
It won't cure the problem.

56:38.257 --> 56:39.657
There will still be impacts.

56:39.658 --> 56:41.800
But it would at least reduce the fever.

56:44.436 --> 56:46.204
The one good thing about ocean noise

56:46.205 --> 56:48.572
is that when you stop making noise,

56:48.573 --> 56:50.575
it goes away.

57:02.354 --> 57:04.688
I've always believed,
from the very beginning

57:04.689 --> 57:07.658
of my struggle, my fight, that we...

57:07.659 --> 57:09.461
We are going to win this.

57:11.596 --> 57:14.432
I have become a grandfather.

57:14.433 --> 57:18.802
I'm all the time thinking about
who is coming behind us.

57:18.803 --> 57:21.039
Our children, our grandchildren

57:21.040 --> 57:24.275
and who comes behind them.

57:24.276 --> 57:26.410
What are we leaving
for the next generations?

57:26.411 --> 57:29.913
Will they survive?

57:29.914 --> 57:31.482
Things that we could not know,

57:31.483 --> 57:34.918
going back 50 years ago,
now are coming into focus.

57:36.319 --> 57:39.022
The ocean, through all of human history,

57:39.023 --> 57:42.493
has made it possible for us to thrive,

57:42.494 --> 57:45.870
to live, to have a secure future.

57:46.071 --> 57:47.571
We can't go back.

57:47.572 --> 57:50.408
But we can make things
better going forward.

57:50.409 --> 57:54.578
This is the time to return the favor.

57:54.579 --> 57:58.516
My father used to say,
"people protect what they love."

57:58.517 --> 57:59.950
And I kept telling him,

57:59.951 --> 58:03.454
"how can you protect
what you don't understand?"

58:03.455 --> 58:05.889
And now we're starting to understand.

58:05.890 --> 58:07.291
And that information,

58:07.292 --> 58:09.927
we need to bring it everywhere,
in every school.

58:09.928 --> 58:12.764
We need to get the kids out, wet.

58:19.738 --> 58:22.106
I have a daughter who's 4 1/2,

58:22.107 --> 58:24.408
and she hasn't seen a whale yet.

58:24.409 --> 58:26.344
And I wanna make sure
that she sees a whale

58:26.345 --> 58:28.412
and that her kids
see whales and their kids

58:28.413 --> 58:29.680
see whales.

58:29.681 --> 58:31.849
Oh, my God!

58:31.850 --> 58:36.787
Oh, my God!

58:36.788 --> 58:38.756
Look at his belly!
Look at the white!

58:38.757 --> 58:42.666
Wow! Whoa!

58:42.667 --> 58:44.436
Oh, my God!

58:48.240 --> 58:50.774
Okay, that might have been
one of the greater moments

58:50.775 --> 58:52.143
of my life.

58:52.144 --> 58:55.013
There's something incredible
about that experience.

58:55.014 --> 58:57.115
And the planet is not just about us.

58:57.116 --> 59:00.751
We're... we're one species here.

59:00.752 --> 59:03.221
And it's incredibly irresponsible for us

59:03.222 --> 59:06.190
not to be better stewards.

59:06.191 --> 59:08.592
And it's not about science...
Science plays a role in it.

59:08.593 --> 59:10.261
You use science.

59:10.262 --> 59:12.363
But it really comes down
to, what do we...

59:12.364 --> 59:13.597
What do we value?

59:13.598 --> 59:16.201
We value a living ocean.

59:19.204 --> 59:21.539
We're putting the ocean at risk.

59:21.540 --> 59:23.174
And if you put the ocean at risk,

59:23.175 --> 59:25.444
you're putting all of us at risk.
