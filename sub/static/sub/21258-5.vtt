WEBVTT

00:02.294 --> 00:04.545
- There's no violation
with us seeing each other.

00:04.546 --> 00:06.547
- This isn't something that I am
trying to get away with.

00:06.548 --> 00:08.424
It's something
I'm feeling inside.

00:08.425 --> 00:10.050
- My son was up for parole
next month.

00:10.051 --> 00:11.719
He wouldn't have gotten
into a fight.

00:11.720 --> 00:13.471
- There's got to be
at least 20 complaints

00:13.472 --> 00:15.055
of prisoners being denied
their release date.

00:15.056 --> 00:16.557
- And every one of them
involves injuries

00:16.558 --> 00:18.559
and some kind of vague
disciplinary action.

00:18.560 --> 00:21.688
- If our firm is in any way
associated with that case,

00:21.689 --> 00:23.356
- we lose a huge client.
- I'm not working on it.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.899
- Then you're gonna put that
in writing.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.734
You have nothing to do
with this case.

00:26.735 --> 00:28.862
- My job requires
a reputation for discretion.

00:28.863 --> 00:30.237
- He'll never tell a soul,

00:30.238 --> 00:31.447
and your business
will stay intact.

00:31.448 --> 00:33.199
- You lived a lie for years.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.576
You can't keep a secret
about working one goddamn case?

00:35.577 --> 00:37.453
- We have a job
we'd like to offer you.

00:37.454 --> 00:39.455
- I don't do business
with people I don't trust.

00:39.456 --> 00:40.498
- You can help these people.

00:40.499 --> 00:41.666
- I want $50,000.

00:41.667 --> 00:43.125
- Oliver, it's me. I'm in.

00:43.126 --> 00:44.377
- What about your promise
to Harvey?

00:44.378 --> 00:45.963
- You let me worry about Harvey.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:54.889 --> 00:56.556
- Hey.

00:56.557 --> 00:57.974
Wait, you're leaving?

00:57.975 --> 01:00.018
Why didn't you wake me?

01:00.019 --> 01:03.521
- 'Cause you still have an hour
before your alarm goes off.

01:03.522 --> 01:06.774
- It's 6:30.
- Where are you going?

01:06.775 --> 01:09.109
There's no way you have
something this early for Harvey.

01:09.110 --> 01:11.153
- I got something
at the clinic with Oliver.

01:11.154 --> 01:12.989
He needs my help with a case.

01:12.990 --> 01:15.075
- Wait.

01:17.244 --> 01:20.830
I was hoping we could
have dinner tonight.

01:20.831 --> 01:22.999
- I probably have to meet
with Oliver tonight, too.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.585
- Well, then why don't you
ask Harvey for some time off

01:25.586 --> 01:27.921
to take care
of what you're working on?

01:27.922 --> 01:29.296
- He's already letting me
go back and forth.

01:29.297 --> 01:30.631
I don't wanna take advantage.

01:30.632 --> 01:32.090
- Mike, I'm just worried
about you

01:32.091 --> 01:34.969
burning the candle at both ends.

01:34.970 --> 01:36.345
- Yeah.

01:36.346 --> 01:39.306
We talked about it last night.

01:39.307 --> 01:42.351
It's not gonna last forever.
I promise.

01:42.352 --> 01:44.228
- Okay.

01:44.229 --> 01:46.982
- Go back to bed.

01:58.577 --> 02:00.661
Oliver, I can't be here all day.

02:00.662 --> 02:02.496
So let's get down to it.
What do you got?

02:02.497 --> 02:05.041
- I've got us a meeting
in Brooklyn with Marc Stevens.

02:05.042 --> 02:06.626
- Who's Marc Stevens?

02:06.627 --> 02:08.669
- He is plaintiff number 18
in our class.

02:08.669 --> 02:10.630
- We're meeting him at nine.
- Great.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.882
That'll give us time
to come up with our cover story.

02:12.883 --> 02:14.884
- Mike, I know you're
not technically allowed

02:14.885 --> 02:16.761
to work on this, but no one
here is gonna rat you out.

02:16.762 --> 02:19.472
- It's not a technicality.
- Oliver, we've been over this.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.223
Me working on this case
means the whole thing

02:21.224 --> 02:22.266
could get tossed out.

02:22.267 --> 02:23.893
- I get it.

02:23.894 --> 02:25.728
There's only two people
in the loop, me and you.

02:25.729 --> 02:27.730
- Exactly.
- So if Nathan asks...

02:27.731 --> 02:29.231
- Nathan asks what?

02:29.232 --> 02:30.524
- Nathan.

02:30.525 --> 02:32.652
- I was just telling Oliver

02:32.653 --> 02:34.403
that if you get sick
of seeing me around here,

02:34.404 --> 02:36.280
then he's gonna have
to tell you too bad,

02:36.281 --> 02:38.574
'cause I am not gonna let
the Brooklyn Housing Project

02:38.575 --> 02:40.701
keep bullying its tenants.

02:40.702 --> 02:42.495
- You can't handle
the BHP on your own?

02:42.496 --> 02:45.164
- I can, but it's nice
having Mike give me some backup.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.791
- Good.

02:46.792 --> 02:48.584
Tell you the truth,
after you made me sign

02:48.585 --> 02:51.378
that conflict of interest waiver
on Oliver's prison case,

02:51.379 --> 02:54.133
I didn't think you'd be
around here that much at all.

03:00.722 --> 03:02.723
- Is there anything left for me?

03:02.724 --> 03:04.976
- No, you slept in late so you
missed me making you breakfast.

03:04.977 --> 03:06.686
- I see, but for the record,

03:06.687 --> 03:08.813
heating up Pop-Tarts
isn't making me breakfast.

03:08.814 --> 03:10.481
- Well, how 'bout
I make it up to you

03:10.482 --> 03:11.941
and not take you out to lunch?

03:11.942 --> 03:14.276
- I appreciate
the non-invitation,

03:14.277 --> 03:15.862
but I can't today.

03:15.863 --> 03:18.196
- Come on, why not?
- I have an appointment.

03:18.197 --> 03:20.407
- Since when do you see
patients at lunch?

03:20.408 --> 03:22.451
- It isn't with
a patient, Harvey.

03:22.452 --> 03:23.953
It's actually with my lawyer.

03:23.954 --> 03:25.454
- What do you mean, your lawyer?

03:25.455 --> 03:27.081
- It's nothing.
- It's a nuisance suit

03:27.082 --> 03:28.374
from an ex-business partner.

03:28.375 --> 03:29.917
- Well, who's handling it
for you?

03:29.918 --> 03:31.127
- I hope you're not
about to suggest

03:31.128 --> 03:32.837
that you handle it for me.

03:32.838 --> 03:34.922
- I'm not, but I can get you
to the next best person.

03:34.923 --> 03:37.341
- And does this person
have a name?

03:37.342 --> 03:38.676
- Louis Litt.

03:38.677 --> 03:40.136
- The one you punched
in the face?

03:40.137 --> 03:41.804
- Paula, he's the best man
for the job.

03:41.805 --> 03:43.514
I'm telling you,
Louis is a pit bull.

03:43.515 --> 03:45.099
- And who says
I want a pit bull?

03:45.100 --> 03:46.475
- Listen to me,
if whatever this thing is,

03:46.476 --> 03:48.268
it's reached the level
of a lawsuit,

03:48.269 --> 03:49.687
you're gonna need
a lawyer like Louis

03:49.688 --> 03:51.313
whether you like it or not.

03:51.314 --> 03:53.399
- Well, I appreciate
your concern, Harvey,

03:53.400 --> 03:55.442
but I prefer
to handle this myself.

03:55.443 --> 03:57.111
But if you still want to help,

03:57.112 --> 03:58.863
why don't you buy me
a new box of Pop-Tarts?

03:58.864 --> 04:02.034
Any flavor will do,
as long as it's strawberry.

04:05.662 --> 04:07.371
- It was total bullshit.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.165
- Are you saying you didn't
get in a fight at all?

04:09.166 --> 04:10.499
- No, I got in a fight,

04:10.500 --> 04:12.251
but it was only to stay alive.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.378
- Just tell us what happened.
- We're on your side.

04:14.379 --> 04:15.755
- Look, I was two months
from getting out, okay?

04:15.756 --> 04:17.255
I was gonna keep my head down

04:17.257 --> 04:19.050
every single day until I walked.

04:19.051 --> 04:20.843
Next thing I know,
some big-ass son of a bitch

04:20.844 --> 04:23.096
is on top of me, and I'm
the one that gets extra time?

04:23.097 --> 04:24.513
- What was his name?
- I don't know, man.

04:24.514 --> 04:26.348
I have no idea.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.308
- Look, Marc, I don't know
if you're afraid of payback

04:28.309 --> 04:29.685
or something, but we need to
know everything if we're gonna...

04:29.686 --> 04:31.687
- I'm not afraid
of no payback, okay?

04:31.688 --> 04:33.147
I don't know who he was.

04:33.148 --> 04:35.609
And if I knew, I would tell you.

04:37.819 --> 04:40.487
Look, that place
took two years of my life.

04:40.488 --> 04:43.241
Two extra years on top of
the two for stealing a few TVs.

04:43.242 --> 04:45.367
If you're going after them,
then I want in on this.

04:45.368 --> 04:47.245
- Then you're in,
but I was in prison

04:47.246 --> 04:48.704
an even shorter time than you,
and I still knew

04:48.705 --> 04:50.581
all the guys' names
on my cellblock.

04:50.582 --> 04:52.792
So either he was new to yours
or you were new to his.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.835
Either way,
I need to know what happened.

04:54.836 --> 04:57.588
- That's easy. I had dinner in
a different block that night.

04:57.589 --> 04:59.715
- Why did you do that?
- 'Cause they told me to.

04:59.716 --> 05:01.467
- Who told you to?
- The guards.

05:01.468 --> 05:03.469
Look, they would post it
on the wall whenever

05:03.470 --> 05:05.179
they felt like it to keep us
from getting too comfortable.

05:05.180 --> 05:07.014
- Which means
you don't know the guard

05:07.015 --> 05:08.808
who decided to move you,
and you don't know the name

05:08.809 --> 05:10.434
of the guy
you got in a fight with.

05:10.435 --> 05:12.270
- I'm telling you guys, man,
I'm not lying.

05:12.271 --> 05:15.022
- I don't think you are.

05:15.023 --> 05:17.859
I think they set it up that way.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.855
- Louis.
- Hold on.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.106
- What are you doing?

05:57.107 --> 05:58.524
- Playing desktop cornhole.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.358
It's supposed to calm my nerves.

06:00.359 --> 06:03.321
- Okay, I hate to interrupt,
but I need to ask a favor.

06:03.322 --> 06:06.157
- Anything.
- What do you need?

06:06.158 --> 06:08.408
- You know I was seeing
a psychiatrist last year, right?

06:08.409 --> 06:10.286
- Harvey, if this has
to do with your well-being,

06:10.287 --> 06:12.330
I'm all ears, but as you know,

06:12.331 --> 06:14.999
I'm not a licensed practitioner
of mental health services...

06:15.000 --> 06:18.418
- Louis, that's not it. Look,
my psychiatrist is being sued.

06:18.419 --> 06:20.504
She has her own attorney,
but I don't trust him,

06:20.505 --> 06:22.464
- and I want you to handle it.
- I don't understand.

06:22.465 --> 06:23.966
If you don't trust him,
why aren't you taking it?

06:23.967 --> 06:25.676
- I told you,
she's my therapist.

06:25.677 --> 06:27.345
- Yeah, was.

06:27.346 --> 06:29.387
That doesn't stop you from
helping her with a legal issue.

06:29.388 --> 06:31.015
- All right, you want the truth?

06:31.016 --> 06:32.309
I'm seeing her.

06:35.478 --> 06:36.854
- You're dating your therapist?

06:36.855 --> 06:38.731
- Look, I don't need
a lecture from you, Louis.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.858
- This isn't a lecture, Harvey.
- If you're dating your therapist

06:40.859 --> 06:43.319
and someone finds out about it,
she could lose her license.

06:43.320 --> 06:44.444
- No, she can't.

06:44.445 --> 06:46.446
We didn't start dating until

06:46.447 --> 06:48.157
after the official
waiting period was over.

06:48.158 --> 06:50.368
- I want your word on that,
because if someone ever asks...

06:50.369 --> 06:53.996
- You have my word.
- I wouldn't lie about that.

06:53.997 --> 06:56.916
- Okay, I'll go talk to her.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.085
But wait a second, Harvey,

06:59.086 --> 07:02.004
does Donna have any idea
about the two of you?

07:02.005 --> 07:04.590
- No, she doesn't,

07:04.591 --> 07:06.676
and for right now I'd like
to keep it that way.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.600
- Six years for stealing
a few TVs, that's not right.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.810
- No, it's not.
- What's our next move?

07:16.811 --> 07:18.104
- We gotta figure out
who decided

07:18.105 --> 07:19.355
a guy two months from parole

07:19.356 --> 07:20.814
should eat
in a different cellblock.

07:20.815 --> 07:22.608
- How the hell
are we gonna do that?

07:22.609 --> 07:24.068
- I don't know, Oliver,
but right now you're gonna

07:24.069 --> 07:25.527
have to work on that yourself.

07:25.528 --> 07:26.904
- What are you talking about?
- Where are you going?

07:26.905 --> 07:28.906
- If I don't show
my face at work,

07:28.907 --> 07:31.117
Harvey is gonna get suspicious.

07:31.118 --> 07:35.746
- Mike, are you sure what
we're doing is worth it?

07:35.747 --> 07:37.039
- Oliver, you're the one
that pushed me

07:37.040 --> 07:38.624
to stick with this
in the first place.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.667
You heard that guy,
they doubled his sentence.

07:40.668 --> 07:43.503
Chris Reyes is dead.

07:43.504 --> 07:45.257
Yeah, it's worth it.

07:50.762 --> 07:52.430
- You must be Harvey Specter.

07:52.431 --> 07:54.140
- Thanks for meeting me, Rick.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.266
I know dominating the energy
sector is a full-time job.

07:55.267 --> 07:57.059
- Get to the point,
Mr. Specter.

07:57.060 --> 07:59.937
I didn't interrupt my day
just so you could kiss my ass.

07:59.938 --> 08:01.730
- Then let me tell you
why you did.

08:01.731 --> 08:04.191
Lockwood Energy is about
to release a solar panel

08:04.192 --> 08:05.401
that looks a hell of a lot
like the one

08:05.402 --> 08:06.860
you've been developing
for years.

08:06.861 --> 08:08.112
- How did you know that?

08:08.113 --> 08:09.405
- Because I didn't
spend all morning

08:09.406 --> 08:10.990
brushing up
on my ass-kissing techniques.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.117
- Then you also know that
Lockwood's green division

08:13.118 --> 08:14.410
has only existed
for three months.

08:14.411 --> 08:16.578
They stole that technology.

08:16.579 --> 08:17.955
- Which is why
you should sign with me

08:17.956 --> 08:19.748
so I can go get it back.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.334
- I already have a law firm.

08:21.335 --> 08:23.002
Why shouldn't
I let them handle this?

08:23.003 --> 08:26.213
- Because you don't want
the guy who's gonna sue Lockwood

08:26.214 --> 08:27.673
after they've stolen
your girlfriend.

08:27.674 --> 08:28.715
You want the guy who's gonna
put them in the ground

08:28.716 --> 08:29.883
before they get the chance.

08:29.884 --> 08:31.260
- You're pretty
sure of yourself.

08:31.261 --> 08:33.846
- You want someone
handling this who isn't?

08:33.847 --> 08:37.265
Look, why don't you take
the week to think it over.

08:37.267 --> 08:38.767
Of course,
while you're doing that,

08:38.768 --> 08:41.645
Lockwood's gonna be rushing
your product to market,

08:41.645 --> 08:45.065
and when they do, your
board's gonna be wondering

08:45.066 --> 08:47.943
why you didn't hire me
when you had the chance.

08:47.944 --> 08:50.821
- All right, Mr. Specter,
you win.

08:50.822 --> 08:52.656
You've got three days.

08:52.657 --> 08:54.701
Let's see if you're as good
as you think you are.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.461
- You must be Paula Agard.

09:05.462 --> 09:06.837
- I'm sorry,
but do we know each other?

09:06.838 --> 09:09.173
- Not yet, but it is
a pleasure to meet you.

09:09.174 --> 09:11.342
I'm Louis Litt, and I understand

09:11.343 --> 09:13.052
you are looking for a lawyer.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.262
- I have a lawyer,
and his name's Peter Shumpert.

09:15.263 --> 09:17.223
- Ah, Peter will not
be joining you today.

09:17.224 --> 09:18.807
- Excuse me?
- I mean, I'm sure

09:18.808 --> 09:20.518
he's a nice guy,
but he's not a litigator.

09:20.519 --> 09:22.019
- Well, I don't see what that
has to do with this.

09:22.020 --> 09:23.521
- When an attorney
lets a client meet

09:23.522 --> 09:25.064
with another attorney, trust me,

09:25.065 --> 09:26.648
you need better representation.

09:26.649 --> 09:28.359
- I already know what
an excellent attorney

09:28.360 --> 09:29.985
you are, Mr. Litt.

09:29.986 --> 09:31.570
Harvey said as much when
he offered your services.

09:31.571 --> 09:34.656
- And why'd you turn him down?
- Because...

09:34.657 --> 09:36.658
there are things
about this situation

09:36.659 --> 09:38.118
that I'd rather
not share with Harvey.

09:38.119 --> 09:40.037
- I can understand that
completely,

09:40.038 --> 09:42.748
and whatever they are,
if I were your attorney,

09:42.749 --> 09:44.791
there is no way in hell that
he would hear them from me.

09:44.792 --> 09:49.004
That I can assure you.

09:49.005 --> 09:51.673
- Okay.
- Okay, Louis.

09:51.674 --> 09:53.467
You can represent me.

09:53.468 --> 09:56.929
- Good. So let's start by
you giving me the history.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.514
- Well, that's just it.

09:58.515 --> 10:00.307
We weren't solely
business partners.

10:00.308 --> 10:04.061
We were living together,
we had a practice together.

10:04.062 --> 10:05.645
- What happened?

10:05.646 --> 10:07.440
- He broke it off,
and he broke my heart.

10:07.441 --> 10:10.317
I gave him everything in
the partnership that he wanted

10:10.318 --> 10:12.194
just to be rid of it and of him.

10:12.195 --> 10:14.154
- And then?

10:14.155 --> 10:16.156
- Some of our group patients
didn't respond well

10:16.157 --> 10:17.950
to his treatment,
so they started

10:17.951 --> 10:19.577
coming to see me privately.

10:19.578 --> 10:21.370
- Privately or secretly?

10:21.371 --> 10:23.205
- If what you're asking
is if I knew it was a violation

10:23.206 --> 10:24.790
of our agreement,
then yes, I did.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.584
But these people were hurting.

10:26.585 --> 10:29.211
- And you couldn't in good
conscience turn them away.

10:29.212 --> 10:30.546
- No, I couldn't.

10:30.547 --> 10:32.590
- Paula, you have my word,

10:32.591 --> 10:36.594
this stays between you and me.

10:36.595 --> 10:38.138
- Thank you.

10:43.935 --> 10:45.978
- Oliver, tell me
you found something.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.854
- Nothing.
- They've got a system

10:47.855 --> 10:49.731
that randomly assigns changes
from time to time.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.442
- Well, what are you
calling me for?

10:51.443 --> 10:52.985
- Because there
might not be a link

10:52.986 --> 10:54.694
between our cases
and the guards,

10:54.695 --> 10:56.614
but I did find one
between the fights.

10:56.615 --> 10:58.574
- I'm listening.
- Out of the 20 cases

10:58.575 --> 11:00.409
we have so far,
the fights have been

11:00.410 --> 11:02.244
with a total
of only four inmates,

11:02.245 --> 11:03.996
and I got the perfect one,
JaMarcus Collins.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.664
He's in the middle of
a ten-year sentence

11:05.665 --> 11:07.666
on cellblock C,
one over from Chris Reyes

11:07.667 --> 11:09.376
and Marc Stevens.

11:09.377 --> 11:11.337
- Well, then we gotta pay
Mr. Collins a visit.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.422
- I've already set it up.
- I'll pick you up in an hour.

11:13.423 --> 11:15.257
- Great.

11:15.258 --> 11:18.218
I will see you at the Brooklyn
Housing Authority then. Okay.

11:18.219 --> 11:20.387
- Whatever you're doing,
put it on hold.

11:20.388 --> 11:22.764
I've got a good cop/bad cop
situation and I need you.

11:22.765 --> 11:24.099
- Wait, right now?

11:24.100 --> 11:25.643
- No, three months
from Thursday.

11:25.644 --> 11:27.269
- Come on, let's go.
- Harvey, I can't.

11:27.270 --> 11:28.354
- What do you mean you can't?

11:28.355 --> 11:30.105
- I ha... I have a meeting

11:30.106 --> 11:32.107
with Oliver at
the Brooklyn Housing Authority.

11:32.108 --> 11:34.026
- I can't leave him hanging.
- Oliver?

11:34.027 --> 11:36.153
You just did a pro bono.
That's not our deal.

11:36.154 --> 11:38.614
- I know that, Harvey, but I
put this in motion weeks ago.

11:38.615 --> 11:40.616
I didn't know you were gonna
give me another pro bono.

11:40.617 --> 11:42.159
- Fine, I'll handle it myself.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.619
Look, whatever you're
doing with Oliver,

11:43.620 --> 11:45.371
wrap it the hell up.

11:45.372 --> 11:48.249
I didn't bring you back to not
be here when I need you.

11:55.340 --> 11:56.840
- Dr. Lipschitz, it's Louis.

11:56.841 --> 12:00.678
Um, look, there's
no two ways to say this.

12:00.679 --> 12:04.223
I was way out of line
the other night,

12:04.224 --> 12:06.808
and I know you care about me,

12:06.809 --> 12:10.770
and not just because
you have an obligation to.

12:10.771 --> 12:12.439
So if it's not too much trouble,

12:12.440 --> 12:15.775
I would like to resume
our sessions, please.

12:15.776 --> 12:17.945
Please call me back.
Thanks.

12:20.823 --> 12:22.908
- Louis, I need to talk
to you about Harvey.

12:22.909 --> 12:24.618
- What about him?

12:24.619 --> 12:25.994
- I just want to make sure
that you and he

12:25.995 --> 12:27.371
are on good terms.

12:27.372 --> 12:29.747
- Yeah, Donna,
we're on good terms.

12:29.748 --> 12:31.833
- Are you sure?
- 'Cause we all pulled together

12:31.834 --> 12:33.835
to get back on solid footing,
and I saw the two of you

12:33.836 --> 12:35.753
huddled up in here earlier,
and I'd hate to think

12:35.754 --> 12:37.423
that things are going
in the wrong direction.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.132
- No, not going in
the wrong direction, Donna.

12:39.133 --> 12:40.800
There is no need to worry.

12:40.801 --> 12:43.053
- Well, I do worry, Louis.

12:43.054 --> 12:45.138
Because I know what kind of
mental state you're still in,

12:45.139 --> 12:47.224
and I know that the slightest
thing can touch you off,

12:47.225 --> 12:48.975
- and I know that...
- Look, Donna,

12:48.976 --> 12:51.311
for your information,
we are on such good terms

12:51.312 --> 12:53.980
that Harvey...

12:53.981 --> 12:55.190
- That Harvey what?

12:55.191 --> 12:57.359
- Nothing.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.027
- Louis, what's going on?

12:59.028 --> 13:00.404
- Okay, look, Donna,

13:00.405 --> 13:02.114
I'm only gonna
tell you this once.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.074
Harvey asked me to handle
a matter for him.

13:04.075 --> 13:06.159
It's personal.
He trusts me with it.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.746
Now, if you trust me at all,
you'll take my word for the fact

13:08.747 --> 13:12.583
that Harvey and I
are on good terms.

13:12.584 --> 13:14.460
- Okay.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.504
I trust you.

13:24.429 --> 13:26.430
- Harvey Specter.
- We didn't have

13:26.431 --> 13:28.181
a proper introduction
the last time we met.

13:28.182 --> 13:29.683
Holly Cromwell.

13:29.684 --> 13:31.101
- What do you want,
Ms. Cromwell?

13:31.102 --> 13:32.394
- So much for formalities.

13:32.395 --> 13:34.020
- I got a lot on my plate.

13:34.021 --> 13:35.855
I don't have time
for formalities.

13:35.856 --> 13:37.274
- If you brought me on,
maybe you would.

13:37.275 --> 13:38.984
- Excuse me?

13:38.985 --> 13:40.778
- Headhunting isn't cutting it
for me, Mr. Specter.

13:40.779 --> 13:42.404
I want back in the game,

13:42.405 --> 13:44.615
and since you're the reason
I'm out of the game,

13:44.616 --> 13:47.200
you should hire me as
a full-time in-house consultant.

13:47.201 --> 13:49.202
- So you want me to give you
a handout out of guilt?

13:49.203 --> 13:51.079
- I don't want a handout.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.582
But you made me a promise you
wouldn't ruin my reputation.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.501
- What do you want me to say?

13:55.502 --> 13:57.252
What you do is dangerous.

13:57.253 --> 13:59.296
- I want you to say you make
promises you can't keep.

13:59.297 --> 14:01.006
And by the way,
you wouldn't have sent

14:01.007 --> 14:02.758
that Rachel woman back to me
if you didn't know

14:02.759 --> 14:04.718
- what I do is worth it.
- Okay, first of all,

14:04.719 --> 14:06.512
I never sent anyone back to you.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.639
And second, whatever job
you think you're suited for

14:08.640 --> 14:10.098
doesn't exist in my firm.

14:10.099 --> 14:12.100
- It does at Baker Simms
and Walker Stein.

14:12.101 --> 14:14.060
- Yeah, well, I'm not looking
to make a spot on the payroll

14:14.061 --> 14:16.522
for someone whose only
skill set is crossing lines.

14:16.523 --> 14:19.149
- You mean when you cross them
so well yourself.

14:19.150 --> 14:22.320
- Like I said, Ms. Cromwell,
I got a lot on my plate.

14:27.826 --> 14:29.951
- Give me a Macallan, neat.

14:29.952 --> 14:31.953
- The way Lockwood
stock shot up,

14:31.954 --> 14:34.164
why not make it a double?

14:34.165 --> 14:35.874
- I'm sorry,
I don't recognize you.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.626
Do you work in Business Affairs?

14:37.627 --> 14:40.420
- No, I work in suing your ass
for trying to pass off

14:40.421 --> 14:42.297
Galvadyne's solar panels
as your own.

14:42.298 --> 14:43.882
- I don't know who you are,

14:43.883 --> 14:45.884
and I don't know
what you're talking about.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.845
We developed
that technology in-house.

14:47.846 --> 14:49.262
- Oh, bullshit.

14:49.263 --> 14:51.431
That technology
takes years to develop,

14:51.432 --> 14:53.809
and your entire division's
only been in existence

14:53.810 --> 14:55.977
- since last Tuesday.
- What can I say?

14:55.978 --> 14:57.688
When you invest
in the right talent,

14:57.689 --> 15:00.190
you can move mountains,
and last I checked,

15:00.191 --> 15:02.901
being smarter than your
competition wasn't illegal.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.111
- Well, if you're half as smart
as you say you are,

15:05.112 --> 15:07.113
you'd give us
our product back now,

15:07.114 --> 15:09.867
or we'll take your company
from you later.

15:09.868 --> 15:12.160
- If you're here
without the FBI,

15:12.161 --> 15:13.995
it means you're just
a shakedown artist

15:13.996 --> 15:16.289
without a shred of evidence
to back up your claims.

15:16.290 --> 15:20.460
- No, it means I'm giving you
the chance to make it right.

15:20.461 --> 15:23.338
Because once I prove
you stole our technology,

15:23.339 --> 15:25.006
the only thing
you'll be celebrating

15:25.007 --> 15:27.051
is a felony fraud conviction.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.266
- Thanks for meeting us,
Mr. Collins.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.517
I'm Oliver Grady,
and this is my associate.

15:35.518 --> 15:37.185
- Your associate got a name?

15:37.186 --> 15:39.563
- My name's not as important
as the questions I have.

15:39.564 --> 15:41.523
Like why did you incite
a brawl in the cafeteria

15:41.524 --> 15:44.276
during lunch on November 4th
of last year?

15:44.277 --> 15:45.985
- What is this?
- I thought you were here

15:45.986 --> 15:47.529
to talk about reviving
my shot at parole.

15:47.530 --> 15:49.406
- We can absolutely
talk about that,

15:49.407 --> 15:51.825
after you tell us why
you conspired with this prison

15:51.826 --> 15:54.369
to get your fellow inmates'
sentences extended.

15:54.370 --> 15:56.622
- This is bullshit.
- Guard!

15:56.623 --> 15:58.832
- Listen, you don't have
to talk to us.

15:58.833 --> 16:00.417
But this thing comes out,

16:00.418 --> 16:02.252
instead of getting out
in five years,

16:02.253 --> 16:04.170
you're gonna spend the rest
of your life in here.

16:04.171 --> 16:07.006
- All right,
what do you wanna know?

16:07.007 --> 16:08.634
- Let's start with who's
telling you to pick fights

16:08.635 --> 16:10.343
with guys who are
about to get out.

16:10.344 --> 16:12.387
- Nobody ever told me
to pick a fight with anybody.

16:12.388 --> 16:15.014
All I know is new guy
comes into the block,

16:15.015 --> 16:16.934
I'm supposed to teach him
a lesson.

16:16.935 --> 16:18.393
- Well, how do you know that
if nobody ever told you?

16:18.394 --> 16:20.145
- It happened, like,
two years go.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.564
I got in a fight with a guy,
they dragged me away.

16:22.565 --> 16:24.691
Thought they were gonna
throw me in Solitary.

16:24.692 --> 16:27.026
Instead, they threw him
in Solitary.

16:27.027 --> 16:30.405
I get back to my cell,
brand-new PlayStation in there.

16:30.406 --> 16:33.199
- And let me guess,
you never thought to ask why.

16:33.200 --> 16:36.161
- I knew why, and I'm not giving
up my goddamn PlayStation.

16:36.162 --> 16:38.330
- You willing to testify
to that in court?

16:38.331 --> 16:42.250
- You really gonna
get me out of here early?

16:42.251 --> 16:44.920
Yeah, I didn't think so.

16:44.921 --> 16:46.631
Guard!

16:47.924 --> 16:49.842
- Hey, how'd it go?

16:49.843 --> 16:51.969
- Well, if you're wondering
if I convinced Paula

16:51.970 --> 16:54.095
to take me on,
the answer is yes.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.597
I am her lawyer now.

16:55.598 --> 16:57.432
We have a settlement
meeting tomorrow,

16:57.433 --> 16:59.518
and this is the last we will
speak about it ever again.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.561
- Louis...
- No, Harvey.

17:01.562 --> 17:03.522
Paula is my client now,
and I don't wanna have to worry

17:03.523 --> 17:05.190
about you sticking
your nose in a case

17:05.191 --> 17:06.775
that you think you can
handle better than me.

17:06.776 --> 17:08.609
- I don't think...
- Because if you could

17:08.611 --> 17:10.236
handle it better than me,
you would, but you can't,

17:10.237 --> 17:11.696
because you're too involved,
and you know it.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.615
- You're right.
- She's in good hands.

17:13.616 --> 17:15.492
- I'll stay out of your way.
- Ah, no. Not good enough.

17:15.492 --> 17:18.286
I want your word, because
I will drop it right now.

17:18.287 --> 17:22.000
- Okay, Louis, you have my word.

17:28.506 --> 17:31.466
- Harvey. Everything okay
with you and Louis?

17:31.467 --> 17:33.134
- Yeah. Why?

17:33.135 --> 17:35.428
- 'Cause he said he was
handling a matter for you,

17:35.429 --> 17:36.930
but he wouldn't tell me
what it was,

17:36.931 --> 17:38.932
and five minutes ago
I saw the two of you

17:38.933 --> 17:40.642
having an intense discussion.

17:40.643 --> 17:42.101
- Everything's okay,

17:42.102 --> 17:44.145
and it wasn't
an intense discussion.

17:44.146 --> 17:45.647
It was a strategic meeting,

17:45.648 --> 17:46.982
so you don't need
to get involved.

17:46.983 --> 17:48.483
- I wasn't trying
to get involved.

17:48.484 --> 17:50.109
I was coming to tell you
that Rick Dunn's

17:50.110 --> 17:51.987
been waiting in your office
for 15 minutes.

17:51.988 --> 17:53.780
- 15 minutes? Why didn't
you come and get me right away?

17:53.781 --> 17:55.991
- Because I only just noticed
him when I walked by,

17:55.992 --> 17:57.743
and I'm not your
secretary anymore.

17:57.744 --> 17:59.995
I'm COO of this firm,
so instead of criticizing me

17:59.996 --> 18:03.041
for working late, why don't
you go see what he wants?

18:05.919 --> 18:07.753
- Rick, I could have
come to your office

18:07.754 --> 18:09.504
if I'd known
you wanted to see me.

18:09.505 --> 18:11.297
- Well, when someone's
avoiding me, I come to them.

18:11.298 --> 18:12.716
- No one's avoiding anyone.

18:12.717 --> 18:14.551
I was gonna give you
a call later.

18:14.552 --> 18:16.428
- And if you had good news,
you'd have done it already.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.221
So what the hell happened?

18:18.222 --> 18:20.139
- What do you think happened?
- They denied everything

18:20.140 --> 18:22.141
and said they developed
that technology on their own.

18:22.142 --> 18:23.643
- Well, I don't give a shit
what they said.

18:23.644 --> 18:25.645
You said you could
get me results.

18:25.646 --> 18:28.231
- And I will, but I didn't say
it would take just one meeting.

18:28.232 --> 18:30.650
- Well, let me tell you what
happened after that one meeting.

18:30.651 --> 18:32.444
They just announced
they're moving up their launch

18:32.445 --> 18:35.113
- by a month.
- Rick, listen to me.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.656
They're not moving anything up.

18:36.657 --> 18:38.992
It's a bluff,
and I give you my word,

18:38.993 --> 18:41.327
they'll never go to market
with your product.

18:41.328 --> 18:43.204
- Now you listen to me.

18:43.205 --> 18:45.916
You said you wouldn't have
anything after one meeting.

18:45.917 --> 18:48.209
Well, you sure as hell
better have it after two.

18:48.210 --> 18:50.587
Because if you don't, I'm gonna
tell everyone in the city

18:50.588 --> 18:52.589
that the only thing
Harvey Specter is good at

18:52.590 --> 18:55.551
is making promises
he can't keep.

19:04.811 --> 19:07.604
- Shit.
- There's no paper trail

19:07.605 --> 19:10.899
proving any inmates were
rewarded for picking fights.

19:10.900 --> 19:12.442
- Okay. Just because
Collins didn't talk

19:12.443 --> 19:13.819
doesn't mean
the other three won't.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.194
- Yes, it does, and you know it.

19:15.195 --> 19:16.822
And none of them
are close to parole,

19:16.823 --> 19:18.657
which means we don't even
have that to offer.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.158
- Okay, then let's go back
through the guards again.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.952
- I told you, that's a dead end.

19:21.953 --> 19:24.705
Brunswick has a system
of randomly assigning changes.

19:27.917 --> 19:31.503
- Then let's start looking
outside of Brunswick.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.588
- Holy shit.

19:33.589 --> 19:34.798
You're right.

19:34.799 --> 19:36.133
They own eight other prisons,

19:36.134 --> 19:37.759
and if they're
doing this in one...

19:37.760 --> 19:39.302
- Then they're doing it
at the other seven.

19:39.303 --> 19:40.595
- And maybe one of them
isn't as good

19:40.596 --> 19:41.763
- at covering their tracks.
- Bingo.

19:41.764 --> 19:43.598
All right, let's do it.

19:43.599 --> 19:45.224
'Cause I'm supposed to be
at dinner right now with Rachel,

19:45.225 --> 19:46.935
not going through files
with you.

19:46.936 --> 19:48.561
- Take your pick.

19:48.562 --> 19:51.230
Wabash, Dalton,

19:51.231 --> 19:53.441
Lambert and Blackwell...

19:53.442 --> 19:55.861
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Lambert?

19:55.862 --> 19:59.031
Lambert Correctional Institute
is owned by Reform Corp?

19:59.032 --> 20:01.199
- Yeah, why?
- You know someone there?

20:01.200 --> 20:03.576
- No.

20:03.577 --> 20:05.871
No, I know somebody
who used to be there.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.539
- He the kinda guy
who'd know something?

20:07.540 --> 20:11.127
- He's the kinda guy
that would know everything.

20:14.463 --> 20:17.049
- Rachel, have you seen Mike?
- He's not in his office.

20:17.050 --> 20:18.884
- Uh, he left earlier
this morning for the clinic,

20:18.885 --> 20:20.426
so he must still be there.

20:20.427 --> 20:22.804
- Again? I told him
to wrap that case up.

20:22.805 --> 20:25.807
- Harvey, he's working hard
to live up to your deal

20:25.808 --> 20:27.142
and still come through
for his other clients.

20:27.143 --> 20:29.102
- Well, right now I need him,

20:29.103 --> 20:31.063
and I'm getting a little tired
of looking into his office

20:31.064 --> 20:32.731
and finding it empty.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.774
- Maybe there's something
I can do to help you.

20:34.775 --> 20:36.526
- No, it's fine.

20:36.527 --> 20:38.945
Just let him know
I'm looking for him.

20:38.946 --> 20:41.740
Actually, now that you mention
it, there is one thing.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.742
I heard you went back
to Holly Cromwell.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.577
- Yes, Mike and I did.
- Is there a problem?

20:45.578 --> 20:47.120
- No, there's no problem.

20:47.121 --> 20:48.747
I just want to know
if she came through.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.289
- Well, she stuck it to us
on the fee a little,

20:50.290 --> 20:51.917
but other than that,
yeah, she came through.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.793
- Was it worth it?

20:53.794 --> 20:55.754
- Let me put it this way, the
article they wrote about Mike,

20:55.755 --> 20:57.715
it never would have
existed without her.

21:09.936 --> 21:12.395
- Wow.
- If it isn't Mike Ross.

21:12.396 --> 21:14.940
I take it you're not here
selling Girl Scout cookies,

21:14.941 --> 21:16.691
but if you are,
I'll take two boxes

21:16.692 --> 21:18.068
of go fu... yourself.

21:18.069 --> 21:19.736
- Just sit down, Gallo.

21:19.737 --> 21:21.320
I don't want to be here
any more than you do,

21:21.321 --> 21:23.198
but I need your help.

21:23.199 --> 21:25.450
- Last time I helped you,
I got five years for my trouble.

21:25.451 --> 21:27.285
- Well, maybe we can
do something about that.

21:27.286 --> 21:28.954
- What the hell is this?

21:28.955 --> 21:32.749
- That is a lawsuit
against your former prison,

21:32.750 --> 21:34.375
for starting fights with inmates

21:34.376 --> 21:36.086
so that they could
extend their sentences,

21:36.087 --> 21:38.838
and I want you
to be an expert witness.

21:38.839 --> 21:40.090
- You gotta be shitting me.

21:40.091 --> 21:41.674
- Frank...
- Save your breath.

21:41.675 --> 21:43.509
There's not a chance
in hell I'm doing this.

21:43.510 --> 21:45.220
- What if I told you I could
make it worth your while?

21:45.221 --> 21:46.763
- It doesn't matter
because I don't know

21:46.764 --> 21:48.223
what the hell
you're talking about anyway.

21:48.224 --> 21:49.933
- Bullshit.
- You expect me to believe

21:49.934 --> 21:52.144
that you own
all the guards in here,

21:52.145 --> 21:53.937
but you didn't know
about a conspiracy

21:53.938 --> 21:55.480
at your last prison?

21:55.481 --> 21:57.315
- Sounds like you know
a whole hell of a lot.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.234
- What do you need me for?
- I need somebody

21:59.235 --> 22:01.611
to tell me everything, and
in exchange I am willing to...

22:01.612 --> 22:03.488
- I'll tell you
what you're willing to do.

22:03.489 --> 22:05.323
What you promised to do
in the first place.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.783
You're gonna get me out of here.

22:06.784 --> 22:08.493
- You know I can't do that.

22:08.494 --> 22:10.328
- Bullshit. That Cahill guy
owes you big time.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.038
March those pretty
little feet in there

22:12.039 --> 22:13.498
and say what has to be said,

22:13.499 --> 22:15.167
or you won't know
anything about anything.

22:15.168 --> 22:17.210
While you're at it,
next time you're here

22:17.211 --> 22:19.546
bring me a goddamn cookie.

22:26.179 --> 22:28.471
- Hope you had time to look over
the settlement offer I sent.

22:28.472 --> 22:30.182
- To be Frank, Mr. Litt,
this number's so low,

22:30.183 --> 22:31.641
we won't even be countering.

22:31.642 --> 22:33.350
We're not negotiating
against ourselves.

22:33.351 --> 22:35.228
- Oh, no, you want me
to negotiate against myself.

22:35.229 --> 22:37.063
Let me tell you something,
that number should be zero.

22:37.064 --> 22:39.732
But Dr. Agard
is willing to pay something

22:39.733 --> 22:41.734
in order to put
this matter behind her.

22:41.735 --> 22:44.529
- But she's not willing to face
me and own up to what she did.

22:44.530 --> 22:46.948
- All she did, Dr. Manning,
was care for your patients.

22:46.949 --> 22:48.449
- Which means she violated
their partnership agreement.

22:48.450 --> 22:50.118
- And according
to the Hippocratic Oath,

22:50.119 --> 22:52.369
patient care supersedes
any legal agreement.

22:52.370 --> 22:53.830
- She didn't care
about those patients.

22:53.831 --> 22:55.372
She just wanted
to steal my business.

22:55.373 --> 22:57.125
- Really? Then why
did they contact her?

22:57.126 --> 22:58.501
- You have no proof of that.

22:58.502 --> 23:00.461
- Yes, I do.
- I have phone records.

23:00.462 --> 23:02.547
My client had
an ethical obligation

23:02.548 --> 23:04.007
to care for those patients.

23:04.008 --> 23:05.758
- And what about
her ethical obligation

23:05.759 --> 23:08.094
- not to sleep with a patient?
- What'd you just say?

23:08.095 --> 23:10.680
- I know that she's been running
around with Harvey Specter,

23:10.681 --> 23:12.849
and it's no surprise that it's
his partner defending her.

23:12.850 --> 23:15.101
- Dr. Agard's personal life
has no bearing on this case.

23:15.102 --> 23:16.895
- Oh, it'll have
plenty of bearing

23:16.896 --> 23:18.688
when the ethics board learn
that she started dating

23:18.689 --> 23:20.232
one of her patients

23:20.233 --> 23:22.067
before the mandatory
waiting period elapsed.

23:22.068 --> 23:24.610
- That's a bald-faced lie,
and now you're twisting facts

23:24.611 --> 23:26.403
in order to blackmail my client.

23:26.404 --> 23:27.864
- Blackmail is
a serious accusation.

23:27.865 --> 23:29.199
My client never asked
for anything

23:29.200 --> 23:30.658
in exchange for his silence.

23:30.659 --> 23:32.077
- Well, he sure as shit
implied it.

23:32.078 --> 23:33.619
- This meeting's over,
Mr. Litt.

23:33.620 --> 23:34.954
Why don't you take
the evening to cool down?

23:34.955 --> 23:37.415
Think of a real number.

23:41.921 --> 23:43.504
- The great Harvey Specter

23:43.505 --> 23:46.091
came all the way
below 14th Street to see me.

23:46.092 --> 23:48.051
- I'm honored.
- What can I say?

23:48.052 --> 23:50.095
When I have good news, I like
to deliver it face-to-face.

23:50.096 --> 23:51.930
- Does that mean
you're ready to hire me?

23:51.931 --> 23:54.307
- Not yet, but if you
take care of something for me,

23:54.308 --> 23:56.976
I just might be.

23:56.977 --> 24:00.063
- Lockwood's launching
a solar panel?

24:00.064 --> 24:02.315
Since when are they in
the renewable energy business?

24:02.316 --> 24:04.943
- Since they stole
the technology from Galvadyne.

24:04.944 --> 24:06.819
- No way.
- They didn't steal it.

24:06.820 --> 24:08.238
- How can you know that?

24:08.239 --> 24:10.073
- Because there's only
six people capable

24:10.074 --> 24:11.991
of that kind of work, and if
one of them did it, I'd know.

24:11.992 --> 24:13.368
- Well, they got it somehow,

24:13.369 --> 24:14.827
and I need to know
how they did it.

24:14.828 --> 24:16.453
- That's not a hell of
a lot to go on.

24:16.454 --> 24:18.748
- If I had more to go on,
I wouldn't need you.

24:18.749 --> 24:21.458
- In other words, you want me
to do the impossible to audition

24:21.459 --> 24:24.213
for a job you told me
yesterday didn't even exist?

24:26.006 --> 24:28.091
- Then consider it
a magic trick.

24:28.092 --> 24:30.009
You make this
information appear,

24:30.010 --> 24:31.636
all of a sudden,
so does that job.

24:31.637 --> 24:33.096
- Then start picking out
an office,

24:33.097 --> 24:34.431
because the next time
you hear from me,

24:34.432 --> 24:36.934
I'm moving in.

24:45.109 --> 24:47.153
- Where the hell have
you been all morning?

24:48.654 --> 24:50.822
- I went to see Sean Cahill
at the S.E.C.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.657
- I hate to break it to you,
Mike, but the S.E.C.

24:52.658 --> 24:54.491
doesn't have jurisdiction
over private prisons.

24:54.492 --> 24:56.411
- I know that. I was trying
to cut Frank Gallo a deal.

24:56.412 --> 24:58.830
- Whoa.
- He said he'll testify?

24:58.831 --> 25:01.207
- Not unless he gets parole,
and Cahill said no.

25:01.208 --> 25:03.835
Which means we need to go
through Gallo's files,

25:03.836 --> 25:06.796
see if we can find another way
to get him released.

25:06.797 --> 25:08.756
- Mike, Mike, hold up a second.

25:08.757 --> 25:11.301
Gallo's files said
he got an extra five years

25:11.302 --> 25:13.845
for assault with a deadly weapon
while he was at Danbury.

25:13.846 --> 25:15.763
- So?

25:15.764 --> 25:17.849
- So that's pretty damn close
to when you got outta there.

25:17.850 --> 25:20.393
Mike.

25:20.394 --> 25:22.438
Is this the guy
who tried to kill you?

25:24.190 --> 25:25.857
- Oliver...
- Jesus, Mike!

25:25.858 --> 25:28.026
We can't put a guy like that
out on the street.

25:28.027 --> 25:30.320
- I'm not trying
to get him out now.

25:30.321 --> 25:31.863
All right, I'm gonna
get him out two years early,

25:31.864 --> 25:34.115
which is still
five years from now.

25:34.116 --> 25:35.825
And in the meantime
if I don't do that,

25:35.826 --> 25:37.827
how many guys are gonna end up
just like Chris Reyes?

25:37.828 --> 25:40.330
- Right now I'm worried about
you ending up like Chris Reyes.

25:40.331 --> 25:41.998
- If Gallo is gonna
come after me,

25:41.999 --> 25:44.167
it doesn't matter if it's
in five years or seven.

25:44.168 --> 25:46.211
We only have so long
before me working on this

25:46.212 --> 25:49.089
becomes too risky, which
means this is the only way.

25:51.384 --> 25:54.802
- Okay.

25:54.803 --> 25:58.014
But I've seen you do things
no other lawyer could.

25:58.015 --> 26:00.016
You're sure as shit
smart enough to convince

26:00.017 --> 26:01.726
this guy to take
something besides parole.

26:01.727 --> 26:03.186
- You don't know Frank Gallo.

26:03.187 --> 26:04.645
- What I know
is what you taught me.

26:04.646 --> 26:06.231
Everybody has
something they want.

26:06.232 --> 26:07.940
Which means all you have
to do is find out

26:07.941 --> 26:10.152
whatever else Gallo wants
and give it to him.

26:14.073 --> 26:15.948
- Louis, hello.
- How did it go?

26:15.949 --> 26:17.574
- Listen to me,
if I'm gonna be your attorney,

26:17.575 --> 26:19.411
I need you to tell me
the goddamn truth.

26:19.412 --> 26:21.329
- I'm not sure I like your tone.
- I told you the truth.

26:21.330 --> 26:23.289
- Did you?
- Because I need to know

26:23.290 --> 26:25.250
if you started seeing Harvey
while he was still your patient.

26:25.251 --> 26:27.210
- What? No.
- Who told you that?

26:27.211 --> 26:29.504
- Your ex, and he's threatening
to go to the board with it.

26:29.505 --> 26:31.214
If there is
one shred of proof...

26:31.215 --> 26:33.383
- There isn't any proof,
because it didn't happen.

26:33.384 --> 26:34.967
And if you don't care
to believe that,

26:34.968 --> 26:36.969
then you can turn around
and walk right out.

26:36.970 --> 26:38.804
Because I don't care to be
represented by a man

26:38.805 --> 26:40.639
who questions my integrity.

26:40.640 --> 26:42.434
- Okay, I am sorry.

26:42.435 --> 26:44.436
I just don't like
being blindsided.

26:44.437 --> 26:45.937
- Well, I'm glad
your shock is behind you,

26:45.938 --> 26:47.688
but mine isn't.

26:47.689 --> 26:49.399
What do you mean
he's going to the board?

26:49.400 --> 26:51.359
- I mean he is blackmailing you

26:51.360 --> 26:53.445
with the threat
of going to the board.

26:53.446 --> 26:55.988
- What?

26:55.989 --> 26:57.532
That would ruin my career.

26:57.533 --> 27:00.368
- I know, which is why
you need to tell me

27:00.369 --> 27:02.704
what really happened
between you and Jacob now.

27:04.790 --> 27:06.583
- Louis, I don't feel
comfortable doing that.

27:06.584 --> 27:08.585
- I'm sorry, Paula,
but you're gonna have to,

27:08.586 --> 27:10.962
because the only defense
against what he is trying to do

27:10.963 --> 27:13.965
is the truth.

27:13.966 --> 27:15.508
- When I told you
he broke my heart,

27:15.509 --> 27:18.970
I was telling the truth.

27:18.971 --> 27:21.139
But what I didn't tell you
was that after that

27:21.140 --> 27:23.392
he changed his mind.

27:31.358 --> 27:34.026
- Donna, I need you
to draw up some paperwork

27:34.027 --> 27:35.570
for a new employee.

27:35.571 --> 27:38.364
- I'll get to it
first thing in the morning.

27:38.365 --> 27:40.241
Wait a second,
why are we bringing on

27:40.242 --> 27:41.993
Holly Cromwell as a consultant?

27:41.994 --> 27:43.911
- Because she kicks ass,
and I don't want to have

27:43.912 --> 27:45.622
to track her down every time
I need her help with something.

27:45.623 --> 27:47.706
- Harvey, I think this
is a mistake.

27:47.707 --> 27:49.250
- Well, it's my call.

27:49.251 --> 27:50.918
- No, actually it isn't.

27:50.919 --> 27:52.545
- Excuse me?

27:52.546 --> 27:54.172
- I told you, I'm not
your secretary anymore.

27:54.173 --> 27:56.007
I'm COO, and you
made me that for a reason.

27:56.008 --> 27:58.843
I know people, and I'm
telling you it's reckless

27:58.844 --> 28:00.928
to hire someone
who betrayed her employer

28:00.929 --> 28:02.472
the first chance she got.

28:02.473 --> 28:04.182
- Donna, I gave her
my word I'd do this

28:04.183 --> 28:05.808
if she came through,
she's gonna come through,

28:05.809 --> 28:07.477
and I already broke
my word to her once.

28:07.478 --> 28:09.020
- Well, then maybe you
shouldn't promise a job

28:09.021 --> 28:10.355
at a law firm to someone
who isn't a lawyer.

28:10.356 --> 28:12.064
- Are you kidding me?

28:12.065 --> 28:13.732
You're not a lawyer,
I just promoted you,

28:13.733 --> 28:15.734
and that worked out pretty
damn well if you ask me.

28:15.735 --> 28:19.531
- And you only did that after I
proved my loyalty to this firm.

28:19.532 --> 28:21.282
- And she's gonna start
proving her loyalty now.

28:21.283 --> 28:22.659
Need I remind you that...

28:22.660 --> 28:25.036
- That you're in charge?
- No, you don't.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.579
And if you try to give me your,

28:26.580 --> 28:28.540
“This isn't something
we vote on” bullshit,

28:28.541 --> 28:31.459
I will find out where Louis is,
and I will bring him

28:31.460 --> 28:33.252
down here right now
with a copy of the bylaws,

28:33.253 --> 28:37.632
because I am betting it is
something we vote on.

28:37.633 --> 28:39.217
- Okay, Donna, you win.

28:39.218 --> 28:40.801
You don't wanna hire her,
we won't.

28:40.802 --> 28:43.221
But you wanna be the one
to make that call,

28:43.222 --> 28:45.641
you're gonna be the one
to tell her to her face.

28:50.187 --> 28:52.438
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:52.439 --> 28:55.316
You hungry? There's some
leftover Thai in the kitchen.

28:55.317 --> 28:59.278
- Great, I'm starving.
- Haven't eaten all day.

28:59.279 --> 29:01.614
- Mike, about that,
I know I said that maybe

29:01.615 --> 29:03.324
you should ask Harvey
for a little time off

29:03.325 --> 29:04.617
to help with the clinic,

29:04.618 --> 29:06.911
but I'm wondering if maybe

29:06.912 --> 29:08.371
you should take
a little time off

29:08.372 --> 29:09.955
from the clinic to help Harvey.

29:09.956 --> 29:11.916
- Rachel...
- He was looking for you today,

29:11.917 --> 29:14.126
and it was clear
it wasn't the first time.

29:14.127 --> 29:16.003
And you said yourself,
he was nice enough

29:16.004 --> 29:17.630
to make this deal
in the first place,

29:17.631 --> 29:20.091
so maybe it's time
to remember that.

29:20.092 --> 29:22.510
- I do remember that.

29:22.511 --> 29:24.929
It's not like we work
on every case together.

29:24.930 --> 29:26.180
He knows that.

29:26.181 --> 29:28.683
- And I know that, too.

29:28.684 --> 29:30.976
But he brought you back
for a reason,

29:30.977 --> 29:33.354
and that's so that
when he does need you,

29:33.355 --> 29:34.939
you'll be there.

29:34.940 --> 29:38.276
- You're right.

29:38.277 --> 29:42.488
I'm just... I'm working
on this Brooklyn Housing thing,

29:42.489 --> 29:45.491
and there's a deadline.

29:45.492 --> 29:47.452
But as soon as it is over,

29:47.453 --> 29:49.828
I will take a break
from the clinic.

29:49.829 --> 29:51.497
Promise.

29:51.498 --> 29:53.165
- Okay.

29:53.166 --> 29:55.834
- Now, did you get
the spring rolls that I like?

29:55.835 --> 29:57.503
- Yes.

29:57.504 --> 29:59.838
No.
Maybe?

29:59.839 --> 30:01.340
- You ate them all, didn't you?

30:01.341 --> 30:02.592
- Well, they were calling
out my name.

30:02.593 --> 30:04.343
- Every time!
- You know that.

30:04.344 --> 30:05.596
It's the sauce!

30:07.431 --> 30:11.643
- Louis, we've never discussed
the specifics of a case before.

30:11.644 --> 30:14.562
Why do you think this one is
so important all of a sudden?

30:14.563 --> 30:16.355
- I don't know.

30:16.356 --> 30:17.856
She kept telling me
all these horrible things

30:17.857 --> 30:19.358
about this guy, but...

30:19.359 --> 30:21.653
- But what, Louis?

30:21.654 --> 30:25.072
- She also told me that all he
wanted to do was get her back.

30:25.073 --> 30:27.199
She felt sorry for him.

30:27.200 --> 30:30.662
I guess I felt sorry
for him, too.

30:30.663 --> 30:33.247
- Sorry for him or for yourself?

30:33.248 --> 30:35.166
- What are you talking about?

30:35.167 --> 30:38.085
- Louis, I hate to draw
comparisons for you,

30:38.086 --> 30:40.797
but is there a chance
you're putting yourself

30:40.798 --> 30:43.508
in this man's shoes
because it's so similar

30:43.509 --> 30:45.217
to what happened
between you and Tara?

30:45.218 --> 30:47.845
- I didn't cheat on her.
- But you behaved poorly.

30:47.846 --> 30:51.182
It ended the relationship,
and you wanted her back.

30:51.183 --> 30:53.392
- And I told you
that I do not want

30:53.393 --> 30:55.812
to talk about getting closure
with Tara anymore.

30:55.813 --> 31:00.316
- I know that, Louis,
but it is my duty

31:00.317 --> 31:01.900
to keep bringing it up to you.

31:01.901 --> 31:06.280
Otherwise, why are we
seeing each other?

31:06.281 --> 31:09.701
- Okay, then, Doc,

31:09.702 --> 31:12.745
honestly,
I don't think that's it.

31:12.746 --> 31:14.706
- Then you shouldn't
have any trouble

31:14.707 --> 31:17.501
doing what you know
you have to do.

31:23.006 --> 31:24.882
- Holly, right?
- Yes.

31:24.883 --> 31:27.218
- I'm Donna Paulsen.
- Thanks for meeting me so early.

31:27.219 --> 31:29.470
- No problem. We can go over
the deal points informally,

31:29.471 --> 31:31.472
but I will need my lawyer
to take a look at the contract

31:31.473 --> 31:33.098
before I sign.

31:33.099 --> 31:34.767
- Actually, I have a few
questions for you first.

31:34.768 --> 31:36.185
- What kind of questions?

31:36.186 --> 31:37.603
- The kind that determine

31:37.604 --> 31:39.981
if you're
Pearson Specter Litt material.

31:42.526 --> 31:44.360
- I'm not here
for my contract, am I?

31:44.361 --> 31:45.695
I'm here because you have
a problem with me.

31:45.696 --> 31:47.196
- I do have a problem with you.

31:47.197 --> 31:48.989
- I see what this is.
- I should have known.

31:48.990 --> 31:51.158
I have an MBA from Wharton,
I graduated with honors,

31:51.159 --> 31:53.077
and you think
all I am is a high-priced...

31:53.078 --> 31:55.954
- No, I don't give a shit what
you think about sex and men.

31:55.955 --> 31:58.374
My problem is that you're
in the betrayal business.

31:58.375 --> 32:00.167
You betray the men
that you prey on,

32:00.168 --> 32:02.002
and then the only time
we had an interaction with you,

32:02.003 --> 32:03.880
you turned on your employer.

32:03.881 --> 32:06.173
- Well, why don't you bring
that up with your employer?

32:06.174 --> 32:08.175
Because he's the one
who got me in that position.

32:08.176 --> 32:10.428
It was the first and last time
I ever did anything like that,

32:10.429 --> 32:12.346
and I lost my livelihood
because of it.

32:12.347 --> 32:14.390
- I didn't know that.

32:14.391 --> 32:16.768
- Discretion and integrity were
the foundations of my business.

32:16.769 --> 32:19.437
Your boss knocked them down,
and I don't appreciate you

32:19.438 --> 32:22.815
questioning whether or not they
were there in the first place.

32:22.816 --> 32:24.859
- What's this?

32:24.860 --> 32:28.487
- That is what I thought I'd be
delivering to my new employer.

32:28.488 --> 32:30.322
- This is exactly
what Harvey needed.

32:30.323 --> 32:31.866
How the hell did you get this?

32:31.867 --> 32:33.618
- What I do is an art.

32:33.619 --> 32:36.245
I find out what people want,
what they're afraid of,

32:36.246 --> 32:38.414
what makes them tick,
and I use it.

32:38.415 --> 32:40.374
And they never know
the big picture,

32:40.375 --> 32:42.627
so when they give me what I
need, they think it's nothing.

32:42.628 --> 32:44.420
- And then when you put
all the pieces together,

32:44.421 --> 32:47.465
it adds up to exactly what
your clients are looking for.

32:47.466 --> 32:49.801
- That's everything
I promised I'd get Harvey,

32:49.802 --> 32:53.220
and it took me less than a day.

32:53.221 --> 32:55.599
I kept my word.

33:04.900 --> 33:06.525
- Where's my cookie?

33:06.526 --> 33:08.360
- Brought you something
better than a cookie.

33:08.361 --> 33:10.655
You were a prisoner
under Reform Corp, too,

33:10.656 --> 33:15.033
which means you are now
a member of the class.

33:15.034 --> 33:18.120
We win this, you're not
Brooks Hatlen bagging groceries

33:18.121 --> 33:19.956
at the Food-Way
when you get out.

33:19.957 --> 33:22.541
You're gonna be Andy Dufresne
sitting on a beach in Mexico

33:22.542 --> 33:24.669
with a bank account
full of cash.

33:24.670 --> 33:26.420
- I already make
a nice living in here.

33:26.421 --> 33:28.756
- You do, but I was thinking
maybe some of that money

33:28.757 --> 33:30.925
- might go to your daughter.
- What'd you just say to me?

33:30.926 --> 33:34.386
- I did some digging, Frank.
- I know you don't talk to her.

33:34.387 --> 33:36.597
And she is not doing great,
and this much money

33:36.598 --> 33:38.934
could really change her life.

33:42.938 --> 33:45.564
- If you're playing
with me on this thing...

33:45.565 --> 33:47.065
- I'm not playing you, Frank.

33:47.066 --> 33:49.443
And I'm not trying
to bully you with this.

33:49.444 --> 33:51.488
I'm trying to help you.

33:58.286 --> 34:01.288
- We had an arrangement.

34:01.289 --> 34:02.832
- Brokered directly
by the prison?

34:02.833 --> 34:05.417
- Not at first,
but I saw the pattern.

34:05.418 --> 34:08.004
Break some skulls, get a reward.

34:08.005 --> 34:10.464
So I went to the source
to get things codified.

34:10.465 --> 34:12.132
- And did you?
- Yeah.

34:12.132 --> 34:13.926
Found out what was what.

34:13.927 --> 34:16.053
It was good at first,
then I realized

34:16.054 --> 34:17.929
it was like working for the mob.

34:17.931 --> 34:20.516
Great work while you can get it,
but you can never quit.

34:20.516 --> 34:23.895
So I tried to put an end
to the whole thing.

34:23.896 --> 34:26.230
That night the guards
killed the cameras,

34:26.231 --> 34:28.815
and five of my so-called
friends did a number on me.

34:28.817 --> 34:30.234
- Wait a second.
- Are you saying this the deal

34:30.235 --> 34:31.527
that got you to Danbury?

34:31.527 --> 34:32.777
You already informed on
this guy?

34:32.779 --> 34:34.237
- No, what are you, nuts?

34:34.239 --> 34:37.199
No one cares how prisoners
are treated.

34:37.199 --> 34:39.618
I informed on real guys
about real crimes.

34:39.619 --> 34:41.245
That's how I got out.

34:41.246 --> 34:43.455
- Are you willing to go on
the record with this?

34:43.456 --> 34:44.916
Tell me your source?

34:44.917 --> 34:47.793
- It's not gonna be
that easy, Mikey.

34:47.793 --> 34:50.755
I'm gonna need an advance
on that settlement.

34:59.472 --> 35:01.139
- Please, sit down.

35:01.140 --> 35:03.475
- Glad to see you've come back
with a real number, Mr. Litt.

35:03.476 --> 35:05.185
- The only number I'm back with

35:05.186 --> 35:07.021
is the one that
I'm gonna do on your client.

35:07.022 --> 35:08.814
- What the hell? You said
he was ready to cut a check.

35:08.815 --> 35:10.482
- Oh, well, what she should
have told you, Jacob,

35:10.483 --> 35:12.234
is when you threaten
someone with blackmail,

35:12.235 --> 35:13.945
you better goddamn be ready
to defend yourself.

35:13.946 --> 35:15.613
- And you better watch how
you talk to my client.

35:15.614 --> 35:17.531
- You client is a lying,
cheating piece of shit,

35:17.532 --> 35:20.200
whose only motive for suing
his ex is to get revenge.

35:20.201 --> 35:22.244
- She broke our agreement.
- No, you broke your agreement

35:22.245 --> 35:24.038
when you had an affair
for two months

35:24.039 --> 35:25.581
and you thought you were
gonna leave her.

35:25.582 --> 35:27.374
- That has nothing
to do with this suit.

35:27.375 --> 35:29.126
- It's got everything
to do with this suit.

35:29.127 --> 35:31.336
You see, you messed up.
You changed your mind

35:31.337 --> 35:33.130
and you wouldn't
take no for an answer

35:33.131 --> 35:34.590
when she ended it,
and that's why you've been

35:34.591 --> 35:36.133
stalking her for the last year.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.551
- I haven't been stalking her.

35:37.552 --> 35:40.012
- Bang. Signed affidavits
one and two.

35:40.013 --> 35:42.139
Unlike your
bullshit accusations,

35:42.140 --> 35:45.059
I have actual proof
from the agency

35:45.060 --> 35:47.603
that you hired to follow her,
to the guy at the news stand

35:47.604 --> 35:51.023
who says you stand there half
the day watching her building.

35:51.024 --> 35:54.026
- Jacob, is this true?

35:54.027 --> 35:57.029
- It is true.
- He knows it's true.

35:57.030 --> 36:00.157
And that is a Class D
felony, Doctor.

36:00.158 --> 36:02.994
I should have you arrested,

36:02.995 --> 36:05.496
or maybe I'll just
go to the board,

36:05.497 --> 36:08.000
have your license removed.

36:10.502 --> 36:13.879
- We were going
to have a life together.

36:13.880 --> 36:16.340
I planned everything out.

36:16.341 --> 36:19.510
Where we were going to live,
how many kids we'd have,

36:19.511 --> 36:21.971
where we'd go
on our anniversary.

36:21.972 --> 36:23.722
And then I make a mistake,

36:23.723 --> 36:25.933
and the next thing I know,

36:25.934 --> 36:28.478
my whole life was gone.

36:30.229 --> 36:32.607
- We'll be dropping the suit.

36:39.531 --> 36:40.781
- You looking for Oliver?

36:40.782 --> 36:42.074
- Nathan, hey.

36:42.075 --> 36:43.868
Uh, yeah, just had some things

36:43.869 --> 36:45.703
that I wanted to run by him.

36:45.704 --> 36:48.748
- On the Brooklyn Housing case
or on your prison lawsuit?

36:51.584 --> 36:53.210
- Look, Nathan, I had to...

36:53.211 --> 36:54.712
- Mike, come on, relax.

36:54.713 --> 36:56.588
I'm not angry.

36:56.589 --> 36:59.800
Though I do wish I had a picture
of your face right now.

36:59.801 --> 37:02.761
- What tipped you off?
- Come on, are you kidding me?

37:02.762 --> 37:04.055
I mean, the second you signed
that agreement,

37:04.056 --> 37:05.514
I knew you'd go back on it.

37:05.515 --> 37:07.058
- So then why didn't
you say anything?

37:07.059 --> 37:08.266
- Because this time
you're screwing over

37:08.267 --> 37:10.352
Harvey Specter and not me.

37:10.353 --> 37:11.854
Look, you're either
gonna win this thing

37:11.855 --> 37:13.480
and we're gonna get
all the credit,

37:13.481 --> 37:15.149
or you're gonna get caught
with your hand

37:15.150 --> 37:16.734
in the cookie jar,
and we'll drop the case.

37:16.735 --> 37:18.402
I have no downside.

37:18.403 --> 37:20.029
- Does Oliver know?

37:20.030 --> 37:21.572
- Yeah, yeah, I pretended
to be pissed at him

37:21.573 --> 37:23.074
and sent him home.

37:23.075 --> 37:24.992
Look, Mike,
why don't you take the night

37:24.993 --> 37:27.327
and think about how much
respect you just gained for me,

37:27.328 --> 37:29.830
then come back
and kill it in the morning.

37:29.831 --> 37:31.415
- Thanks, Nathan.

37:31.416 --> 37:33.334
- You're welcome, Mike.

37:37.214 --> 37:38.797
- Donna, before you
go home tonight,

37:38.798 --> 37:40.841
I need you to cut me
a check for Holly.

37:40.842 --> 37:42.509
- What do you mean? I'm gonna
put her on the payroll.

37:42.510 --> 37:44.261
- She doesn't want
to work here anymore.

37:44.262 --> 37:46.388
Said she'd rather do
one-off jobs if at all.

37:46.389 --> 37:48.599
Here's the amount.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.475
- I don't understand.
- I was good with having her.

37:50.476 --> 37:54.146
- Well, whatever you said made
her not good with having us.

37:54.147 --> 37:56.815
- Harvey, we're
a tight-knit group.

37:56.816 --> 37:58.275
We don't betray each other

37:58.276 --> 38:00.444
and we don't keep secrets
from each other.

38:00.445 --> 38:02.113
I had to find out
where she stood.

38:02.114 --> 38:03.906
And if the cost of that
was her not coming here,

38:03.907 --> 38:04.990
then I don't regret it.

38:04.991 --> 38:06.533
- I understand, Donna.

38:06.534 --> 38:07.785
I'm not coming down on you.

38:07.786 --> 38:09.161
I just need the check.

38:09.162 --> 38:10.662
- Harvey, is there something

38:10.663 --> 38:12.581
that you're not telling me
about this woman?

38:12.582 --> 38:14.541
'Cause it seems like you've
been different lately,

38:14.542 --> 38:16.668
and... I don't know.

38:16.669 --> 38:18.129
- It's nothing about this woman.

38:18.130 --> 38:19.838
I just thought she'd be
a good addition.

38:19.839 --> 38:21.339
These things happen.

38:21.340 --> 38:23.008
- It's funny.

38:23.009 --> 38:25.761
I love my new position,
but I miss this.

38:25.762 --> 38:28.305
- I miss it, too.

38:28.306 --> 38:30.975
- You want me to pour us
a couple drinks?

38:30.976 --> 38:32.726
- Maybe tomorrow night.

38:32.727 --> 38:34.686
I have something I have
to deal with right now.

38:34.687 --> 38:36.354
- Okay.

38:36.355 --> 38:38.650
I'll cut you that check.

38:43.863 --> 38:47.407
- You were right, Doc.

38:47.408 --> 38:51.662
I hadn't really dealt with Tara.

38:51.663 --> 38:54.165
But one thing is clear.

38:54.166 --> 38:56.626
The situation was my doing.

38:59.004 --> 39:01.797
Which means...

39:01.798 --> 39:04.466
I need to keep
working on myself,

39:04.467 --> 39:06.718
because...

39:06.719 --> 39:09.680
I don't wanna mess things up
with the next Tara.

39:09.681 --> 39:12.724
- Louis, typically I refrain

39:12.725 --> 39:17.271
from saying things like this
to my patients, but...

39:17.272 --> 39:19.774
I am proud of you.

39:23.195 --> 39:24.820
- Good night, Doc.

39:24.821 --> 39:26.948
- Good night, Louis.

39:32.829 --> 39:35.539
- Time for one more appointment?

39:35.540 --> 39:38.250
- Hello.
- What are you doing here?

39:38.251 --> 39:40.418
- I wanted to take you out
and celebrate.

39:40.419 --> 39:42.046
Louis told me what happened.

39:42.047 --> 39:43.547
- I just got off
the phone with him.

39:43.548 --> 39:45.216
He did an amazing job.

39:45.217 --> 39:47.969
And you did an amazing job
recommending him.

39:50.096 --> 39:53.807
- Why didn't you tell me
about Jacob?

39:53.808 --> 39:55.684
- I asked Louis
not to tell you that.

39:55.685 --> 39:57.228
- Louis didn't tell me.
- Well, then how do you...

39:57.229 --> 39:59.230
- Because I do,
and all I could think of

39:59.231 --> 40:02.440
was I wish you trusted
me enough to know

40:02.441 --> 40:05.110
that I wouldn't go nuts on
this guy for what he did to you.

40:05.111 --> 40:07.112
- Is that why you think
I didn't tell you?

40:07.113 --> 40:08.613
- Well, you know my history
with infidelity.

40:08.614 --> 40:10.490
What else could it be?

40:10.491 --> 40:14.328
- Harvey, the man cheated on me.

40:14.329 --> 40:18.874
I trusted him,
and he cheated on me,

40:18.875 --> 40:21.543
and I was afraid
of how you'd see me.

40:21.544 --> 40:25.505
- Why would him cheating on you
make me see you differently?

40:25.506 --> 40:27.549
- Because some people
think that a woman

40:27.550 --> 40:31.929
who can be cheated on
can't be...

40:31.930 --> 40:34.806
loveable.

40:34.807 --> 40:36.683
- How can you know me
and think that?

40:36.684 --> 40:39.603
- Well, it's not about you.
- It's about me.

40:39.604 --> 40:41.479
- And if this guy
did this to you,

40:41.480 --> 40:44.358
then he's an idiot,
and all he did

40:44.359 --> 40:47.362
is lose out on something great.

40:49.072 --> 40:51.907
Not loveable?

40:51.908 --> 40:54.826
- Psychiatrists don't
know everything, you know.

40:54.827 --> 40:57.247
- I'm starting to realize that.

41:15.807 --> 41:18.267
- You really are burning
the candle at both ends.

41:18.268 --> 41:20.060
- Hey.
- Is this for me?

41:20.061 --> 41:22.146
- Mm-hmm. Since you were
too busy to come to dinner,

41:22.147 --> 41:24.940
I thought, why can't
dinner come to you?

41:24.941 --> 41:26.817
- I don't understand.
- What do you mean, come to me?

41:26.818 --> 41:30.279
- I brought it to the clinic,
Mike, but you weren't there.

41:30.280 --> 41:32.572
- I just... I must have
not been back yet.

41:32.573 --> 41:33.991
- Back from where?

41:33.992 --> 41:35.826
Was it the nursing home
in Brooklyn

41:35.827 --> 41:37.661
or was it
the Department of Buildings?

41:37.662 --> 41:41.748
Because Oliver, he couldn't
seem to decide which.

41:41.749 --> 41:43.667
- Rachel, I didn't...
- Mike, if you can't tell me

41:43.668 --> 41:45.085
what's going on,
I'm gonna start to wonder

41:45.086 --> 41:46.837
what else you've been
keeping from me.

41:46.838 --> 41:49.340
- I wasn't lying about
working a case with Oliver.

41:49.341 --> 41:51.049
I just didn't tell you
which one.

41:51.050 --> 41:52.968
- The prison one.

41:52.969 --> 41:56.013
- Yeah.
- You signed an agreement.

41:56.014 --> 41:57.597
This is a fireable offense.

41:57.598 --> 41:59.683
- Harvey isn't gonna
fire me for...

41:59.684 --> 42:01.977
- Okay, but maybe he should.
- How can you say that?

42:01.978 --> 42:03.687
- Because you're taking
advantage of his trust,

42:03.688 --> 42:05.522
not to mention mine.

42:05.523 --> 42:07.524
- Rachel, these prisoners are
being exploited for money.

42:07.525 --> 42:09.193
- And you trying
to do the right thing

42:09.194 --> 42:11.528
doesn't change the fact
that you gave your word.

42:11.529 --> 42:14.198
- Rachel...
- Look...

42:14.199 --> 42:16.867
We've been through enough
for you to know

42:16.868 --> 42:18.910
that I'm still gonna
love you in the morning,

42:18.911 --> 42:20.578
but you have to ask yourself:

42:20.579 --> 42:23.165
What is your word worth?

42:23.166 --> 42:24.749
'Cause with the way
things are going,

42:24.750 --> 42:26.878
it's not gonna be worth
very much.
