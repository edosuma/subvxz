00:03.460 --> 00:05.996
Come on, Billy,
just walk with me.

00:06.063 --> 00:07.731
Come on, Billy!

00:07.799 --> 00:09.666
Hey, why do I always
have to walk Billy?

00:09.734 --> 00:12.302
It's part of your mascot duties.
Chester never complained.

00:12.370 --> 00:14.071
Yeah, well,
Chester was a hack.

00:14.138 --> 00:17.541
I took four years of ballet,
Kate... Not for this!

00:19.344 --> 00:22.012
Oh, I don't think so.
I don't think so.

00:22.080 --> 00:23.914
- Let go of the goat, asshole.
- You let go. He's my goat.

00:23.982 --> 00:26.116
Get them both in.
We've got to get out of here.

00:26.184 --> 00:28.285
Billy!

00:28.353 --> 00:30.087
Go go go!

00:30.154 --> 00:32.122
Kate!
Kate!

00:32.189 --> 00:34.157
Overland rules!

00:34.625 --> 00:36.493
Billy!

01:09.828 --> 01:12.930
He's my starting quarterback and this
is the biggest game of the season.

01:12.997 --> 01:15.832
We're playing Overland and you
can't take him away from me, Warren.

01:15.900 --> 01:17.401
He was arrested
with a prostitute.

01:17.468 --> 01:18.936
Come on, he was set up!

01:19.003 --> 01:21.939
The kid does missionary work
for Christ's goddamn sake.

01:22.006 --> 01:24.207
He's a con artist
who hides behind the cross.

01:24.275 --> 01:26.944
And quite frankly I'm tired
of this football rivalry.

01:27.011 --> 01:29.246
I mean, Overland stole
our mascot this morning.

01:29.314 --> 01:30.647
It's a tradition.

01:30.715 --> 01:33.684
Dean Simon, if you can
find it within your heart

01:33.751 --> 01:37.621
To reinstate me for Saturday's
game, don't do it for me,

01:37.689 --> 01:39.423
Do it for the children
of Chile

01:39.490 --> 01:41.592
'cause they desperately
need my help.

01:41.659 --> 01:44.494
Look, you have the power
to make this thing go away.

01:44.562 --> 01:46.330
Just say the right words,
please.

01:46.397 --> 01:48.298
Short of the charges
being dropped

01:48.366 --> 01:51.168
There's nothing I can do.
Sorry, coach.

01:52.704 --> 01:54.671
Coach Daniels,

01:54.739 --> 01:57.240
Maybe we should pray
on this.

01:57.308 --> 01:59.476
Yeah, that's
a good idea, Travis.

01:59.544 --> 02:01.945
Let's all pray.

02:02.513 --> 02:04.281
Dear God,

02:04.349 --> 02:07.351
Please help my star quarterback
keep his dick in his pants.

02:09.586 --> 02:10.753
Amen.

02:19.697 --> 02:21.331
All right, goats,
let's bring it in.

02:21.399 --> 02:24.201
Hurry.
Hustle it up.

02:24.268 --> 02:26.403
All right, you've probably
already heard the rumors.

02:26.471 --> 02:28.672
We lost Travis
for Saturday's game

02:28.740 --> 02:30.741
And possibly
for the whole season.

02:30.808 --> 02:32.743
There's no need
to panic

02:32.810 --> 02:35.479
Because we still have
a game to play Saturday.

02:35.546 --> 02:37.981
Moran, this is
your team now.

02:38.049 --> 02:40.317
Let's have a good practice.
Let's go!

02:40.385 --> 02:43.620
Okay, all right.
Thanks, guys.

02:43.688 --> 02:46.957
Hey, coach,
this has been a mistake.

02:47.025 --> 02:48.458
It's no mistake.

02:48.526 --> 02:49.960
You're the starting
quarterback.

02:50.028 --> 02:52.896
I get that and
I'm here for the team.

02:52.964 --> 02:55.065
I... You know,
I've had this pain

02:55.133 --> 02:57.768
In my oblique
that's been killing me.

02:57.835 --> 02:59.903
I don't think I'm gonna be
ready for Saturday's game.

02:59.971 --> 03:01.304
Ready?

03:01.372 --> 03:03.206
See, I don't give a shit
if you're ready or not.

03:03.274 --> 03:05.242
You're gonna run out
on that field Saturday

03:05.309 --> 03:06.977
With a dickful
of confidence

03:07.045 --> 03:08.550
And you're gonna take
that confidence

03:08.580 --> 03:10.710
and you gonna shoot it
all over the stadium.

03:10.980 --> 03:12.480
End of conversation.

03:14.580 --> 03:15.580
That's nice, thanks!

03:17.850 --> 03:19.250
Walk on the big time, bro!

03:19.350 --> 03:20.100
Go ahead.

03:20.167 --> 03:22.268
It used to be me and Trav.
Now it's me and you.

03:22.936 --> 03:24.371
Let's do this.

03:30.810 --> 03:31.878
Who the hell is this?

03:31.945 --> 03:34.280
He wouldn't let go of the goat.
He says he's the mascot.

03:34.348 --> 03:35.648
You guys aren't gonna
get away with this.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.984
Whatever.
Get the goat some water

03:38.052 --> 03:39.185
And, I don't know,
get this guy...

03:39.253 --> 03:40.653
I've got
all the milk I need.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.622
I'm a survivor.

03:42.690 --> 03:45.425
Fine.
Get this guy nothing.

03:45.492 --> 03:47.293
"Get this guy nothing"
that's your voice.

03:47.361 --> 03:50.096
- Shut up, asshole!
- You shut up!

03:50.164 --> 03:53.132
I'm telling you right now,
once that door closes

03:53.200 --> 03:54.534
Something bad's gonna...

03:56.570 --> 03:58.371
<i>The sad truth is
that without Travis</i>

03:58.439 --> 04:00.907
<i>The goats might as well
kiss this season goodbye.</i>

04:01.874 --> 04:02.742
It's open!

04:04.609 --> 04:06.578
I need you to do me
a favor, okay?

04:06.646 --> 04:09.148
It's only gonna take
a second.

04:09.215 --> 04:11.450
I need you to break
my ankles, dude.

04:11.518 --> 04:13.385
Look, man, no one's
breaking ankles.

04:13.453 --> 04:14.987
- Please.
- Listen, man.

04:15.055 --> 04:17.255
The Shilo-Moran show
had to come to town someday.

04:17.324 --> 04:20.192
And what better day than on
Saturday and on national tv?

04:20.260 --> 04:22.060
Just a tap... That's all
it's gonna take. Come on!

04:22.129 --> 04:23.663
Look, man, I need you
to come through for me.

04:23.730 --> 04:26.132
I've seen you play before, man.
You don't gotta do this.

04:31.671 --> 04:32.472
You're right.

04:32.539 --> 04:35.208
- I don't have to do this.
- Hell no.

04:36.844 --> 04:39.312
I gotta get Travis
back on the team.

04:46.786 --> 04:50.623
We're, like,
best friends.

04:50.691 --> 04:53.526
You and me

04:53.594 --> 04:56.395
Are best friends
for life.

04:56.462 --> 04:57.529
Hey, Travis!

05:00.233 --> 05:02.968
Those staring contests
really get to me.

05:03.036 --> 05:03.903
Right.

05:03.970 --> 05:06.238
Okay, see you, Trav.

05:12.179 --> 05:14.213
I just wanted a blowjob,
Moran.

05:15.281 --> 05:18.284
That doesn't make me
a bad christian, right?

05:19.351 --> 05:21.187
I don't think so, no.

05:21.554 --> 05:23.157
Hey, let me
ask you something.

05:25.225 --> 05:28.327
Did you at least try to get
the prostitute to say

05:28.395 --> 05:30.296
Maybe she was getting a ride
home with you that night?

05:30.363 --> 05:32.164
Of course, you know.

05:32.232 --> 05:34.500
That's what I always do.

05:34.568 --> 05:36.068
This one just
wouldn't go for it.

05:36.136 --> 05:37.903
Right.

05:37.971 --> 05:39.872
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna talk to her for you.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.007
Would you do that
for me?

05:42.075 --> 05:44.143
Yeah.

06:01.661 --> 06:04.530
Mm, well.

06:04.598 --> 06:08.200
$25 for the hand, $50 for
the mouth and $75 for the ass.

06:08.268 --> 06:10.569
I'm sorry, I'm looking
for Stacy Fandel.

06:10.637 --> 06:12.571
Mm-hmm, I'm Stacy Fandel.

06:12.639 --> 06:14.206
And if the ass
doesn't interest you,

06:14.274 --> 06:16.408
I'm having a sale on
ski-shoots... two for $80.

06:17.476 --> 06:18.878
I'm looking for
the prostitute

06:18.945 --> 06:21.313
Who got arrested
with Travis McKenna.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.648
You're looking
at her, baby.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.383
Are you
a football player?

06:24.951 --> 06:26.352
No, I'm...

06:26.619 --> 06:28.487
- Hey, Dave.
- Hello.

06:28.855 --> 06:30.256
I'm Travis's backup.

06:31.323 --> 06:34.660
Well, then you may enter
my palace of pleasure.

06:35.428 --> 06:36.762
All right.

06:41.401 --> 06:44.370
So what you do?

06:44.437 --> 06:47.072
You come here to thank me
now that you're a starter?

06:47.540 --> 06:48.774
Actually, the opposite.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.843
I came here to offer you
50 bucks

06:50.911 --> 06:53.712
So you can maybe
go to the cops and say

06:53.780 --> 06:56.081
That you were just getting a ride
home with Travis the other night.

06:56.149 --> 06:57.349
So you want me
to lie?

06:57.917 --> 06:58.651
Yeah.

06:58.718 --> 07:00.753
Well, let me tell you
something, Mr. Backup...

07:00.821 --> 07:03.556
Stacy Fandel
is not a liar.

07:04.223 --> 07:06.625
I may suck cock
for crack,

07:06.893 --> 07:07.960
But at the end
of the day

07:08.028 --> 07:10.696
I lay in my bed
right with God.

07:11.998 --> 07:14.400
Right.
Did Overland pay you off?

07:14.468 --> 07:16.402
Because I'll match
whatever they're paying you.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.304
Please, you think I'd take
money from those losers?

07:18.371 --> 07:20.806
I am a goat fan...

07:20.874 --> 07:23.142
A goat fan.
Baa!

07:23.210 --> 07:25.277
That's fantastic.
You're a fan.

07:25.345 --> 07:27.480
We need Travis
back on the team.

07:27.547 --> 07:29.115
Please.
I'll do anything.

07:29.182 --> 07:30.716
I'll do anything to get him
back on the team.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.152
- Anything?
- Within reason.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.654
Okay, you know Craig Shilo?

07:35.722 --> 07:37.089
Yeah yeah yeah.

07:37.157 --> 07:38.424
I want to suck his dick.

07:38.492 --> 07:40.059
You what to what?

07:40.127 --> 07:42.128
I want to suck
that dick.

07:42.195 --> 07:46.365
Listen, see,

07:46.433 --> 07:48.934
That boy does
things to me.

07:49.002 --> 07:51.137
I mean, the way he runs
and he cuts

07:51.204 --> 07:52.972
And he hits that hole,
it's just...

07:53.039 --> 07:54.540
I'm getting moist
just thinking about it.

07:54.608 --> 07:57.409
Listen, if you can help me
get those balls right here,

07:57.477 --> 07:58.878
I will help you.

07:58.945 --> 08:01.080
That's impossible.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.115
You have a better shot
at banging the pope.

08:03.183 --> 08:05.551
Oh, okay.

08:05.619 --> 08:07.720
Well, you have good luck
on the game Saturday.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.522
And if you need a handjob
before the game, text me.

08:09.589 --> 08:11.290
Okay, wait wait.
Hold on, hold on.

08:11.358 --> 08:13.425
Let me see
what I can do, okay?

08:15.595 --> 08:16.762
Open that.

08:20.967 --> 08:21.935
This is perfect.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.470
We made
"the Blue Mountain monitor."

08:24.237 --> 08:26.138
You guys are gonna get
a lot of money for me.

08:26.206 --> 08:28.274
What do you mean, you?

08:28.341 --> 08:29.942
This article's
about the goat.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.878
Shut up!
Let me see that.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.447
Oh, I get it.

08:35.515 --> 08:38.183
They probably don't want
to panic people.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.719
Right right.

08:39.787 --> 08:44.356
Either that or nobody
gives a shit about you.

08:52.766 --> 08:53.767
Go...

08:55.335 --> 08:57.069
Shilo, what's
the play again?

08:57.137 --> 08:58.304
Are you serious?
You just called it.

08:58.372 --> 08:59.538
I think I'm
blacking out, man.

08:59.606 --> 09:01.307
33 draw, man.

09:01.375 --> 09:03.609
- 33 draw.
- Okay.

09:03.677 --> 09:06.278
It's called a huddle. It happens
before the play, Moran.

09:06.346 --> 09:09.115
Go...
What's the count?

09:20.093 --> 09:21.994
Great recovery, Moran.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.130
Damn it.

09:26.199 --> 09:29.402
Hey, Moran, let's not make
that shovel pass bullshit

09:29.469 --> 09:31.237
A big part of our game
on Saturday, all right?

09:31.304 --> 09:33.639
Right right.

09:37.010 --> 09:39.145
How do you feel
about blowjobs?

09:39.212 --> 09:41.381
I mean, they're not
personal, right?

09:41.448 --> 09:44.183
A b.J. is a b.J. No matter who's
giving it to you, right?

09:44.751 --> 09:46.452
No.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.422
But if a chick,
we'll call her a chick...

09:49.489 --> 09:51.090
If she wanted
to give you one

09:51.158 --> 09:52.592
And you knew
that said b.J.

09:52.660 --> 09:54.694
Was gonna help us
win Saturday's game,

09:54.762 --> 09:56.462
You'd do it, right?

09:56.930 --> 09:58.197
I'd have to run it
by Denise first.

09:58.265 --> 10:01.133
No no, Denise doesn't
have to know about this.

10:01.201 --> 10:04.236
Why do you keep
asking me about b.J.S?

10:04.304 --> 10:05.971
You're creeping me out.

10:06.039 --> 10:08.140
No reason.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.376
You play poker, right?

10:10.444 --> 10:12.144
A friend of mine's putting
together a game tonight.

10:12.212 --> 10:13.446
Sure.

10:13.514 --> 10:16.215
But no more b.J. talk,
all right?

10:18.418 --> 10:20.219
Come on!

10:20.287 --> 10:22.588
Hello, let's go!

10:25.092 --> 10:28.227
Damn it, Alex!
Pick up the phone.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.229
You know you're free to go
at any time, right?

10:33.533 --> 10:37.369
B... Bodacious.

10:37.437 --> 10:42.675
I... Incredible.

10:42.743 --> 10:46.312
L... Loving.

10:46.379 --> 10:48.314
L...

10:48.381 --> 10:50.683
Literally a goat.

10:50.751 --> 10:53.886
Y... Yesterday.

10:53.954 --> 10:55.421
Billy.

10:58.391 --> 10:59.592
That message goes out

10:59.660 --> 11:02.828
To the wannabe douchebags
over at Overland:

11:02.896 --> 11:06.232
You can take our goat,
but we've got Alex Moran.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.870
Alex Moran.
Alex Moran.

11:15.075 --> 11:17.009
So when we get
to my friend's house

11:17.077 --> 11:18.944
Just try to keep
an open mind.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.481
And have a few drinks,
let your guard down.

11:21.548 --> 11:24.483
Man, why do I need to have
an open mind to play poker?

11:24.551 --> 11:26.185
You know what?
Hey, Sammy. What's up?

11:26.253 --> 11:29.155
What's up? I'm kidnapped.
That's what's up.

11:29.222 --> 11:31.924
That sucks. I'll see you
at the dorms, okay?

11:31.992 --> 11:33.660
See you later, man.

11:33.727 --> 11:35.295
Are you serious?

11:35.362 --> 11:37.462
Alex Moran.
Alex Moran.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.598
Thank you.
Thank you.

11:39.666 --> 11:42.634
You guys wanna know
something about Billy?

11:42.702 --> 11:44.303
Billy eats
his own crap.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.472
Oh, yeah,
I've seen it.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.074
Anyou want to know
something else?

11:48.142 --> 11:50.309
A real human being
was taken yesterday...

11:50.377 --> 11:52.011
A human being
with real feelings.

11:52.079 --> 11:54.480
- He's right.
- Thank you.

11:54.548 --> 11:56.682
Billy is just
like one of us,

11:56.750 --> 11:57.984
- With real feelings.
- No.

12:00.020 --> 12:02.422
Fine. You want Billy?
I'll get you Billy.

12:02.489 --> 12:04.223
Is that what you
want to hear?

12:04.291 --> 12:06.092
We love Billy!

12:10.130 --> 12:12.231
What's up, man?

12:12.299 --> 12:14.767
- Your friend lives here?
- She's modest.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.302
- Where have you been?
- Holy shit.

12:16.370 --> 12:18.504
I came here straight from
ethics class to meet you.

12:19.472 --> 12:20.907
Do you know how much
crack I've been offered?

12:20.974 --> 12:22.942
- Why are you here? - What do
you mean, why is she here?

12:23.010 --> 12:25.645
We play poker
as a team... Bam!

12:25.712 --> 12:27.914
You can't invite your girlfriend
to a boys' night out.

12:27.981 --> 12:30.516
You said your friend
was a girl.

12:30.584 --> 12:32.985
That's not the point.

12:35.989 --> 12:37.623
Coming.

12:39.059 --> 12:40.626
- Stace, hey!
- Hey.

12:40.694 --> 12:42.328
Hi, thank you
for having us.

12:42.396 --> 12:44.964
No problem.
You delivered.

12:45.032 --> 12:46.499
Yeah yeah.

12:46.567 --> 12:49.602
So this is Denise.
This is Craig.

12:49.670 --> 12:50.970
- How are you doing?
- Hi, Craig.

12:51.038 --> 12:54.307
Hey! Where is
the poker table?

12:54.374 --> 12:56.909
The poker table?
The only table I got set up

12:56.977 --> 12:58.811
Is that romantic
dinner table for two.

12:59.879 --> 13:01.280
Isn't it romantic, Craig?

13:02.783 --> 13:04.650
What the hell
is going on?

13:04.718 --> 13:06.886
First of all,
this is my house, okay?

13:06.954 --> 13:09.155
And I ask the questions. And
the first question I have is

13:09.223 --> 13:10.957
Who the hell
is you?

13:11.024 --> 13:12.992
Who in the hell is I?

13:13.060 --> 13:15.528
Yes. Is there an echo in that
big pineapple head of yours?

13:15.596 --> 13:17.463
I'm the one with the real pussy.
That's who I am.

13:17.531 --> 13:19.832
Hey, ladies
ladies ladies!

13:19.900 --> 13:21.801
Hey, let's not do
anything rash.

13:21.869 --> 13:23.236
What the hell is
going on here, man?

13:23.503 --> 13:25.872
Yeah, tell him, Alex.

13:26.939 --> 13:29.609
What's the worst thing your
friend's ever asked you to do?

13:32.913 --> 13:35.915
Jesus christ, you again?
Dude, we...

13:42.656 --> 13:44.290
He's taking the goat!

13:44.358 --> 13:46.692
He's taking the goat!

13:47.260 --> 13:50.196
Hey, asshole, stop! We're
returning the goat after the game.

13:50.264 --> 13:51.597
Yeah, and then you'll get
all the glory.

13:51.665 --> 13:53.099
I don't think so, lady.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.737
Oh my God, I can
fix this for you, Billy.

13:57.804 --> 14:01.140
We're almost there.
We're almost there.

14:04.411 --> 14:07.146
Go, Billy.
Make a run for it.

14:07.214 --> 14:09.348
I'll let you
back at the field.

14:16.322 --> 14:17.789
Billy?

14:20.761 --> 14:25.398
In 1999 the Oklahoma state starting
quarterback gets injured

14:25.465 --> 14:29.902
And tailback production falls 45%
when the backup takes over.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.971
Alex, Travis is out,
all right?

14:32.039 --> 14:33.205
There's nothing
we can do about it.

14:33.273 --> 14:35.875
That's not entirely true.

14:36.443 --> 14:38.210
Stacy can get Travis
back on the team.

14:38.278 --> 14:39.411
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.280
Whoo!
Are you serious?

14:43.483 --> 14:45.017
In order for that
to happen

14:45.085 --> 14:48.153
Stacy wants a little
something from you.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.522
Oh my God, anything.

14:50.590 --> 14:52.825
I wanna blow you.

14:53.892 --> 14:55.060
Excuse me?

14:55.128 --> 14:57.830
No no no, I'm serious.
No, hold on, Craig, listen.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.698
Listen, Craig.
I'm your biggest fan.

14:59.766 --> 15:02.201
And I just want a little beady
piece of you right in here...

15:02.268 --> 15:03.936
I mean, just a tip.

15:04.003 --> 15:06.271
That'll never happen.
No way in hell I will...

15:06.339 --> 15:07.673
He'll do it.

15:08.942 --> 15:11.110
- He'll do it.
- All right.

15:11.177 --> 15:13.112
What the hell
did you do?

15:13.179 --> 15:14.713
This was supposed to be
a lighthearted prank.

15:14.781 --> 15:16.882
Maybe if you didn't kidnap me
this wouldn't have happened.

15:16.950 --> 15:19.818
We didn't kidnap you,
you freak.

15:19.886 --> 15:20.953
We kidnapped Billy.

15:21.020 --> 15:23.288
Rub it in,
why don't you?

15:24.158 --> 15:27.392
Merry christmas.
Merry christmas, baby.

15:27.660 --> 15:32.131
Hush, little baby,
don't say a word...

15:32.698 --> 15:34.066
I can't do it!

15:34.134 --> 15:37.703
- Craig. - Hey, Craig,
I'm sorry, man.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.738
Now this is all
up to you.

15:41.341 --> 15:43.075
How about going down
on Craig's girlfriend?

15:43.143 --> 15:44.376
It's close, right?

15:44.444 --> 15:46.345
I'll do it.

15:46.412 --> 15:48.947
That's disgusting.

15:51.402 --> 15:54.337
<i>Alex Moran, Alex Moran,
Alex Moran...</i>

15:54.405 --> 15:56.572
<i>That is all people are
talking about today.</i>

15:56.640 --> 15:59.375
<i>Can the freshman qb lead
this mountain goat team</i>

15:59.443 --> 16:01.010
<i>To victory
against Overland U?</i>

16:01.078 --> 16:02.579
<i>No no, he can't.</i>

16:02.647 --> 16:06.015
<i>I think we'll all have our worst
fears realized at noon today.</i>

16:06.083 --> 16:08.718
<i>This season is over
for the goats.</i>

16:12.856 --> 16:14.724
B-M-S!

16:14.792 --> 16:17.226
Go goats!

16:18.294 --> 16:21.096
Now please welcome
Dean Simon.

16:22.099 --> 16:24.867
Mountain Goats
can't be beat.

16:34.411 --> 16:37.112
You assholes,
it's only a goat.

16:38.682 --> 16:40.816
Billy!

16:40.884 --> 16:41.750
Billy?

16:45.088 --> 16:47.990
Oh, no!

16:48.058 --> 16:51.961
Look what Overland
did to Billy.

16:52.028 --> 16:55.431
Why, God?

16:55.498 --> 16:57.132
Why?

16:58.335 --> 17:01.103
All right, guys,
listen up.

17:01.171 --> 17:03.305
They say the sign
of a great team...

17:03.373 --> 17:05.441
Hold on, coach.
I gotta say something.

17:05.508 --> 17:08.743
Look, I know a lot of you
guys don't believe in me.

17:08.811 --> 17:11.347
I know that I haven't really
given you a reason to.

17:11.414 --> 17:13.415
But I want to let
you guys know something...

17:13.483 --> 17:17.685
I'm ready for this.

17:17.753 --> 17:20.155
Shilo, I'm here for you.

17:22.726 --> 17:25.260
Go, goats!

17:28.098 --> 17:29.932
We're totally screwed.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.369
Overland killed Billy.

17:39.909 --> 17:41.477
Sammy?

17:41.544 --> 17:43.245
Hey, Alex.

17:43.313 --> 17:46.081
- What happened?
- It's not good.

17:46.149 --> 17:48.083
- Denise.
- The stage is set, babe.

17:48.151 --> 17:51.153
Look, it's time for my man
to step up and shine.

17:51.221 --> 17:52.187
All right?

17:54.257 --> 17:55.958
You're right, baby.

17:56.026 --> 17:57.860
It's time for your man
to step up.

18:00.730 --> 18:02.464
I gotta get Travis
back on the team.

18:02.532 --> 18:04.199
Craig, where are
you going?

18:06.002 --> 18:09.138
They killed my goat, Marty.
I don't care what you have to do,

18:09.205 --> 18:11.640
Just make sure that those cowards
from Overland suffer today.

18:13.376 --> 18:15.144
If you want that,

18:15.211 --> 18:17.246
You know what you're going
to have to do, right?

18:17.313 --> 18:19.181
Fine.

18:19.249 --> 18:21.550
Travis is back
on the team.

18:21.618 --> 18:24.119
Just promise me that
you'll make those assholes pay.

18:24.187 --> 18:26.955
We're gonna rip them
a new one.

18:27.023 --> 18:29.358
Travis is back on the team.

18:33.696 --> 18:36.265
Travis is back
on the team!

18:36.332 --> 18:39.968
What?
Oh, thank Christ.

18:44.974 --> 18:46.408
Okay.

18:46.476 --> 18:49.078
It was a good ride
while it lasted, Moran.

18:51.848 --> 18:53.282
Dickface.

18:53.349 --> 18:55.684
Yeah!
Travis is back, y'all.

18:55.752 --> 18:57.653
My boy is back.

19:01.825 --> 19:03.225
Suck it, Moron.

19:03.293 --> 19:05.360
Let's get 'em, Trav.
Come on!

19:14.604 --> 19:16.638
Oh, shit!

19:16.706 --> 19:18.974
Craig.
Craig, baby!

19:29.018 --> 19:33.055
Craig!
Stop, baby.

19:33.123 --> 19:35.057
Craig, no!
Stop, Craig.

19:40.196 --> 19:42.464
Craig, no!

19:42.532 --> 19:44.700
Oh, thank God
I caught you in time.

19:48.371 --> 19:49.571
Go goats.

19:52.393 --> 19:54.627
Last weekend was
a trying time

19:54.695 --> 19:56.229
For Blue Mountain State.

19:56.297 --> 19:59.766
But as I so often do, I was
able to rise above it

19:59.833 --> 20:04.470
And help defeat our rivals
at Overland University.

20:06.707 --> 20:09.275
It is in honor of that
trying weekend

20:09.343 --> 20:11.611
That I dedicate
this statue.

20:28.696 --> 20:30.129
Let me get this
straight...

20:30.197 --> 20:31.831
This guy almost ruins
our entire season

20:31.899 --> 20:34.267
And he dedicates a statue
to himself;

20:34.335 --> 20:36.369
I rush for more
than 220 yards

20:36.437 --> 20:38.805
And all I do is
get blown by a tranny?

20:38.872 --> 20:40.773
I know. And he doesn't even
put me in the statue.

20:40.841 --> 20:43.276
I was there.
I killed that goat.

20:46.113 --> 20:47.548
Wait, you got blown
by a tranny?
