WEBVTT

00:00.734 --> 00:02.436
Let's think this through.

00:02.470 --> 00:06.440
If we ask corporate
for that, then...

00:06.474 --> 00:09.543
They are either
gonna say...

00:09.577 --> 00:11.345
yes or no.

00:11.379 --> 00:13.047
Could go either way.

00:13.081 --> 00:15.216
We don't know
what they are going to say.

00:15.249 --> 00:16.550
Think it through!

00:16.584 --> 00:18.319
Have to think it through.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.288
Because if they say no...

00:22.823 --> 00:24.158
Can we not?

00:24.192 --> 00:25.526
No--yes, we have to.
You know why?

00:25.559 --> 00:27.561
'Cause I don't like to be
cooped up in that office.

00:27.595 --> 00:28.796
In that box
all day long.

00:28.829 --> 00:30.164
Heisman!

00:30.198 --> 00:33.301
Because I need to think.
Okay, Jim?

00:33.334 --> 00:35.769
Oh, Kevin!
Oooh!

00:38.806 --> 00:40.074
Ugh!
Nice catch.

00:40.108 --> 00:41.375
Mm mm mm mm.

00:41.409 --> 00:43.844
Oscar!

00:43.877 --> 00:45.113
Intercepted.

00:45.146 --> 00:46.480
Right here.
Give it to me.

00:46.514 --> 00:47.481
Phyllis, give me the ball.

00:47.515 --> 00:48.482
Okay, give me the ball.

00:48.516 --> 00:49.483
You guys...

00:49.517 --> 00:51.085
Creed, give me the ball
right now.

00:51.119 --> 00:51.852
Give it to me.
Ryan.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.521
Aaaah!

00:53.554 --> 00:55.556
Aaaaah!
Fumble!

00:55.589 --> 00:56.824
Yeah!

00:59.560 --> 01:00.661
All right, hey, Dwight!

01:01.895 --> 01:03.864
Whoo!

01:03.897 --> 01:05.233
Hut hut hut hike!

01:09.303 --> 01:10.738
You all right, Ryan?

01:10.771 --> 01:12.306
Yeah.

01:14.842 --> 01:15.843
Pam!

01:48.409 --> 01:53.247
Oh, they're having
a sale on TiVo.

01:53.281 --> 01:56.150
Maybe I should get a TiVo.

01:56.184 --> 01:58.419
Ooh, DVD burner.

01:58.452 --> 02:00.921
Maybe I should
get one of those.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.823
You are so lucky, Jim.

02:02.856 --> 02:05.659
You are so lucky
you don't have this problem.

02:05.693 --> 02:09.297
What was the ninth place
prize again?

02:09.330 --> 02:11.532
A loaf of bread?

02:11.565 --> 02:13.634
Cojino's pizza.

02:13.667 --> 02:14.835
Oh, great.

02:14.868 --> 02:17.371
Tasty terrific pizza.

02:17.405 --> 02:22.843
Question, do their pizzas
play DVDs?

02:22.876 --> 02:26.347
Dwight was the top salesman
of the year at our company.

02:26.380 --> 02:27.881
He wins a little prize money
and gets honored

02:27.915 --> 02:30.618
at some convention.

02:30.651 --> 02:33.587
It is literally
the highest possible honor

02:33.621 --> 02:35.689
that a Northeastern
Pennsylvania based

02:35.723 --> 02:37.858
mid-size paper company
regional salesman

02:37.891 --> 02:39.827
can attain, so...

02:40.961 --> 02:42.630
What did I do
to deserve this?

02:42.663 --> 02:43.631
that Dwight beat you?

02:43.664 --> 02:44.632
No.

02:44.665 --> 02:45.733
Are you gonna cry, Jim?

02:45.766 --> 02:47.401
Do you need a tissue?

02:47.435 --> 02:48.969
Hey, I heard you got
a wedding dress.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.338
Do you have pictures?

02:50.371 --> 02:51.505
Oh, yeah.

02:51.539 --> 02:53.874
I'll show 'em
to you later.

02:53.907 --> 02:56.377
Oh, I should get back.

02:56.410 --> 02:57.611
Talk to you guys later.

02:57.645 --> 02:58.612
Okay, cool.

02:58.646 --> 03:00.448
I have a ton of stuff
to do for the wedding.

03:00.481 --> 03:02.516
And I have to do it
in the office.

03:02.550 --> 03:04.818
And that can be
kind of awkward.

03:04.852 --> 03:07.988
Uh, just because
people can get all weird

03:08.021 --> 03:09.857
about wedding stuff.

03:09.890 --> 03:12.426
I just--I don't
want to offend...

03:12.460 --> 03:15.529
Angela.
Or someone.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.435
That's what she said.

03:21.469 --> 03:22.536
Ha!

03:22.570 --> 03:23.871
I don't get it.

03:23.904 --> 03:26.640
Grapes, seductive.

03:26.674 --> 03:28.776
So, you ready for the
big speech this afternoon?

03:28.809 --> 03:30.678
Well, it's not really
a big speech.

03:30.711 --> 03:31.745
You're still coming, right?

03:31.779 --> 03:34.582
Oh, absofruitly.

03:34.615 --> 03:36.016
Fruit, grapes.
Nailed the joke.

03:36.049 --> 03:36.817
Matter of time.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.786
Uh, and yes,
it is a big speech.

03:38.819 --> 03:41.722
Biggest of your life.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.891
Speaker
at the sales convention.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.426
Been there, done that.

03:45.459 --> 03:47.328
Went there again,
did it again.

03:47.361 --> 03:49.363
Two years in a row.

03:49.397 --> 03:51.799
Consecutive.

03:51.832 --> 03:54.702
I just--I miss the feeling
of knowing

03:54.735 --> 03:56.604
that you did a good job
because somebody

03:56.637 --> 03:58.038
gives you proof of it.

03:58.071 --> 04:00.441
Sir, you're awesome.

04:00.474 --> 04:01.709
Here's a plaque.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.811
What, a whole year
has gone by

04:03.844 --> 04:04.845
and you need more proof?

04:04.878 --> 04:05.746
Here's a certificate.

04:05.779 --> 04:08.549
They stopped
making plaques that year.

04:08.582 --> 04:11.585
What if I give a really long
extended thank you?

04:11.619 --> 04:15.556
For instance,
thank you Mr. blank.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.858
Thank you very, very...

04:17.891 --> 04:18.859
That would look terrible.

04:18.892 --> 04:20.461
These are mostly salesmen.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.430
And salesmen expect
to be entertained.

04:22.463 --> 04:23.697
And you are the main act.

04:23.731 --> 04:24.932
When I was
in the sixth grade,

04:24.965 --> 04:27.735
I was a finalist
in our school spelling bee.

04:27.768 --> 04:30.838
It was me
against Raj Patel.

04:30.871 --> 04:34.875
And I misspelled, in front
of the entire school,

04:34.908 --> 04:36.877
the word "failure".

04:36.910 --> 04:38.512
I can't do this.

04:38.546 --> 04:40.381
That's because
you're incapable of doing it.

04:40.414 --> 04:41.915
Because you don't know how.

04:41.949 --> 04:44.818
Because you have no skills.

04:44.852 --> 04:47.388
Dwight, there's no way
I can possible teach you

04:47.421 --> 04:48.856
what you need to know
about public speaking

04:48.889 --> 04:49.890
by speech time.

04:49.923 --> 04:52.326
Okay.

04:52.360 --> 04:53.694
But I can teach you enough
so that you don't

04:53.727 --> 04:54.995
embarrass me
or the company.

04:55.028 --> 04:55.996
Okay, deal.

04:56.029 --> 04:56.997
I'll do
whatever you say.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.065
No questions asked.

04:58.098 --> 04:59.533
Well, if you have a question,
you should ask me.

04:59.567 --> 05:01.469
I'll try and think of one.

05:01.502 --> 05:02.836
Don't try to think
of a question to humor me.

05:02.870 --> 05:05.072
Just try not
to be such an idiot.

05:05.105 --> 05:06.507
Is that an insult
or is that

05:06.540 --> 05:08.041
part of the public speaking
advice?

05:10.644 --> 05:13.381
Insult.

05:13.414 --> 05:14.648
Mom, I'm sorry.

05:14.682 --> 05:16.850
I know you and Dad are
chipping in for the wedding,

05:16.884 --> 05:20.788
but I do not want
orange invitations.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.756
Yes.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.091
Well, if you really want...

05:24.124 --> 05:26.059
Hi, yeah, can I talk to
one of your travel agents.

05:26.093 --> 05:28.762
I'm gonna take a trip.

05:28.796 --> 05:31.732
I'm gonna get out
of town for a while.

05:31.765 --> 05:35.669
And go someplace...
not here.

05:35.703 --> 05:37.805
Where do I wanna go?

05:37.838 --> 05:39.940
Um, that is
an excellent question.

05:39.973 --> 05:42.910
And one I probably
should have thought about

05:42.943 --> 05:44.945
before I called you.

05:44.978 --> 05:47.581
I get here early
every morning

05:47.615 --> 05:49.817
so I can set
the thermostat.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.753
I like it a little cooler,
around 66 degrees.

05:52.786 --> 05:54.788
I'm more productive.

05:54.822 --> 05:56.056
Maybe some people
don't like it

05:56.089 --> 05:57.725
as cold as I do.

05:57.758 --> 05:59.092
But I don't care.

05:59.126 --> 06:02.029
But seriously,
what's the difference

06:02.062 --> 06:03.664
between a salesman
and a saleswoman?

06:03.697 --> 06:04.598
A saleswoman has a vagina.

06:04.632 --> 06:06.700
It's a joke, Dwight.
It's not a sex ed class.

06:06.734 --> 06:07.801
But I'm right.

06:07.835 --> 06:08.969
Yeah, you're right about
the difference

06:09.002 --> 06:10.571
between a man and a woman
but not about the punchline

06:10.604 --> 06:12.473
to the joke, all right?

06:12.506 --> 06:15.008
The difference between
a salesman and a saleswoman

06:15.042 --> 06:16.810
is boobs.

06:16.844 --> 06:19.813
Hey, do you remember
the speeches that you gave?

06:19.847 --> 06:20.648
I do, both of them.

06:20.681 --> 06:21.849
Could I have a copy
of one of them?

06:21.882 --> 06:23.484
No no, they would remember.

06:23.517 --> 06:26.086
Look, it doesn't matter
what you say,

06:26.119 --> 06:27.788
it just matters that you're
saying something

06:27.821 --> 06:29.457
that people care about.

06:29.490 --> 06:30.691
Yeah?

06:30.724 --> 06:32.493
All right, here we go.
Watch this.

06:32.526 --> 06:34.928
Attention everybody!
Attention please.

06:34.962 --> 06:37.665
I have some very great news
from corporate.

06:37.698 --> 06:40.000
We had a wonderful quarter,
and as a result,

06:40.033 --> 06:42.803
all of you are
getting bonuses for $1,000.

06:42.836 --> 06:43.971
Yeah!

06:44.004 --> 06:46.640
Congratulations.

06:51.512 --> 06:52.913
You see that?

06:52.946 --> 06:53.847
You see how
they responded to me?

06:53.881 --> 06:56.149
In that moment,
I had them.

06:56.183 --> 06:58.486
That is so great
about the bonus!

06:58.519 --> 06:59.687
No no, it's not true.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.088
I was just talking.

07:01.121 --> 07:03.857
So just go out there
and say anything.

07:03.891 --> 07:05.593
They'll eat it up,
they're a great audience.

07:05.626 --> 07:07.728
Go ahead, get the wallpaper.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.029
Wallpaper the ceiling
if you want.

07:09.062 --> 07:10.864
Excuse me?

07:10.898 --> 07:13.000
May I have
your attention please?

07:13.033 --> 07:16.136
There had been an accident
on 84 West.

07:16.169 --> 07:17.805
Cars have skidded
off the road

07:17.838 --> 07:19.006
into the safety railing.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.675
Several cars have flipped.

07:21.709 --> 07:22.943
There is broken glass
everywhere.

07:22.976 --> 07:25.879
Several people are injured.

07:25.913 --> 07:28.916
Do we know anyone
who was in the accident?

07:28.949 --> 07:32.019
Brad Pitt.

07:32.052 --> 07:34.755
Also, there will be
no bonuses.

07:34.788 --> 07:35.756
Why would this
affect our bonuses?

07:35.789 --> 07:36.857
They're unrelated.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.091
Is Brad okay?

07:38.125 --> 07:39.560
He will never act again.

07:39.593 --> 07:42.095
Also, this branch is closing.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.531
What the hell
is going on here?

07:43.564 --> 07:44.565
Are we out of jobs?

07:44.598 --> 07:45.666
Yes.

07:45.699 --> 07:46.934
This is karma because
of what he did

07:46.967 --> 07:47.801
to Jennifer Anniston.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.670
He was kidding.
Dwight was kidding.

07:49.703 --> 07:52.773
And I don't know why
because it wasn't funny.

07:52.806 --> 07:55.075
And it was just horrible.

07:55.108 --> 07:56.109
Michael?
Yeah?

07:56.143 --> 07:57.978
You said we were
getting bonuses.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.080
All right, everybody
in the conference room now.

08:00.113 --> 08:01.715
Let's go.
Let's do it.

08:01.749 --> 08:03.717
Cancel the wallpaper.

08:03.751 --> 08:05.553
As your leader
and your friend,

08:05.586 --> 08:07.721
I sort of demand
that you can all

08:07.755 --> 08:10.023
speak in public
as I can.

08:10.057 --> 08:11.959
And did.
Twice.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.927
You saw the plaque, right?

08:13.961 --> 08:16.096
All right, we're all
gonna go around the room

08:16.129 --> 08:17.798
and we're going
to make toasts.

08:17.831 --> 08:20.267
And that way we will
overcome our fear

08:20.300 --> 08:21.268
of public speaking.

08:21.301 --> 08:22.870
You mean toastmasters?

08:22.903 --> 08:24.672
Pam, I'm public speaking.

08:24.705 --> 08:25.806
Stop public interrupting me.

08:25.839 --> 08:28.241
Actually, this would be
good practice

08:28.275 --> 08:29.777
for your wedding toast.

08:29.810 --> 08:33.180
Yeah, the bride doesn't
really do...

08:33.213 --> 08:34.514
Have you ever been
to a wedding?

08:35.683 --> 08:36.917
Can I go?

08:36.950 --> 08:40.721
Yes, good.
Jim taking the initiative.

08:40.754 --> 08:44.592
So, uh, I am going
on a trip.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.760
But I'm not really sure
where I'm going yet.

08:46.794 --> 08:47.795
It's kinda open ended.

08:47.828 --> 08:48.929
So I was hoping
maybe you guys

08:48.962 --> 08:50.731
would have some suggestions.

08:50.764 --> 08:51.932
You should go
to Hedonism.

08:51.965 --> 08:53.867
What is that?

08:53.901 --> 08:57.270
It's like Club Med,
but everything is naked.

08:59.673 --> 09:00.774
I was thinking
more like Europe.

09:00.808 --> 09:01.842
Or something like that.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.811
But good second choice.

09:03.844 --> 09:05.846
Been to Amsterdam.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.815
Oh, okay, you know what?

09:07.848 --> 09:11.018
That's not a toast.
You're not standing up.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.252
To Amsterdam.

09:12.285 --> 09:14.187
When did you go there?

09:14.221 --> 09:17.625
Um, after my divorce.

09:17.658 --> 09:18.859
Really?
For like how long?

09:18.892 --> 09:20.828
About a week or...

09:20.861 --> 09:22.129
Maybe a month.

09:22.162 --> 09:23.897
Jimmy, listen to me.

09:23.931 --> 09:26.066
You do not want to go
to Amsterdam, trust me.

09:26.099 --> 09:27.367
Where do I wanna go?

09:27.400 --> 09:29.336
I'd send you to Hong Kong.

09:29.369 --> 09:31.138
I'd like to say hi
to my friends in China.

09:36.276 --> 09:40.047
Okay.
Dwight.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.349
Show us what you have
learned today.

09:46.987 --> 09:48.956
Good morning, Vietnam!

09:57.264 --> 09:59.767
Okay, you know what?
This isn't working.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.069
Because, um, I'm not nervous
in front of them.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.336
They're my subordinates.

10:03.370 --> 10:04.872
No, we're not.

10:04.905 --> 10:06.707
Uh, yes, you are.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.341
I am the
assistant regional manager.

10:08.375 --> 10:09.777
Which means
absolutely nothing.

10:09.810 --> 10:10.878
Michael, can you explain?

10:10.911 --> 10:12.846
Well, it's mostly made up.

10:14.982 --> 10:16.383
Dwight is not going
to do a good job, it's sad.

10:16.416 --> 10:17.751
And they're
expecting excellence

10:17.785 --> 10:19.086
because I did do
such a great job.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.287
Two years in a row
I killed.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.755
It was amazing.

10:23.323 --> 10:24.992
Confidence, Dwight!

10:30.430 --> 10:32.332
Dwight, if you could travel
anywhere in the world,

10:32.365 --> 10:33.166
where would you go?

10:33.200 --> 10:36.269
I can travel anywhere,
except Cuba.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.706
And I will travel
to New Zealand.

10:38.739 --> 10:39.439
And walk the
Lord of the Rings trail

10:39.472 --> 10:40.741
to Mordor.

10:40.774 --> 10:42.743
And then I will
hike Mt. Doom.

10:42.776 --> 10:44.745
Now just leave me alone.

10:44.778 --> 10:47.414
Okay, just trying to
get some advice on my trip.

10:47.447 --> 10:49.116
Please, you're not
taking any trip.

10:55.088 --> 10:57.958
You know, I majored
in public speaking in college?

10:57.991 --> 10:59.727
You did?
Mm-hmm.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.028
And the first thing
that they teach you

11:01.061 --> 11:02.796
is that you've gotta
be true to yourself.

11:02.830 --> 11:06.800
And you
are all about authority.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.702
Yes, I am.

11:08.736 --> 11:10.771
The great speakers
throughout history

11:10.804 --> 11:13.741
were not joke tellers,
they were people of passion.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.208
So, if you wanna
do well today,

11:15.242 --> 11:16.309
you gotta do
what they did.

11:16.343 --> 11:17.477
Which is?

11:17.510 --> 11:19.479
You've gotta wave
your arms,

11:19.512 --> 11:21.148
and you've gotta
pound your fists.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.784
Many times.

11:23.817 --> 11:24.852
So as to emphasize
your point.

11:24.885 --> 11:28.221
Okay, I didn't actually
major in public speaking.

11:28.255 --> 11:30.423
But I did download speeches
from some of history's

11:30.457 --> 11:32.059
famous dictators.

11:32.092 --> 11:33.761
Like this one.

11:33.794 --> 11:35.428
Originally given
by Benito Mussolini.

11:35.462 --> 11:38.065
Okay, look, I know
you're giving this speech

11:38.098 --> 11:39.166
on your own.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.267
But I wrote up
a few talking points

11:40.300 --> 11:41.301
for you to
take a look at.

11:41.334 --> 11:42.970
Hope you don't mind.

11:43.003 --> 11:44.037
I'll glance at it.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.208
It's time, Dwight.
The grim reaper is here.

11:51.344 --> 11:54.314
The very best of luck
to you, Dwight.

11:54.347 --> 11:55.883
Thank you, Angela.

12:02.155 --> 12:04.291
Why'd you pick the VA
for the reception?

12:04.324 --> 12:05.826
Roy has a connection.

12:05.859 --> 12:07.795
It's nicer than you think.

12:09.797 --> 12:11.431
You're inviting Jim?

12:11.464 --> 12:14.734
Of course, he's one
of my closest friends.

12:16.369 --> 12:20.007
All right, ready?

12:20.040 --> 12:21.809
Here we go!

12:26.579 --> 12:28.515
Wow, it's a little bit bigger
than I remembered.

12:29.817 --> 12:32.853
Come on, we're down here
in the front.

12:42.529 --> 12:44.798
* Y'all ready for this

12:44.832 --> 12:47.868
*

12:55.608 --> 12:58.545
I am just feeling
under the weather.

12:58.578 --> 13:01.849
And I think that I will
go home and rest.

13:01.882 --> 13:04.584
I've never ever seen you
take a sick day.

13:04.617 --> 13:08.121
Well, I've seen you take enough
for the both of us.

13:08.155 --> 13:11.524
Next, I'd like to introduce
the Dunder-Miflin

13:11.558 --> 13:15.062
salesman of the year
Dwight Schroot!

13:20.868 --> 13:23.503
Dwight, they called your name.

13:23.536 --> 13:26.239
Dwight, how we doing?

13:26.273 --> 13:27.507
Okay, you know what?

13:27.540 --> 13:29.309
You know what?
Okay.

13:29.342 --> 13:30.343
No, no problem.

13:30.377 --> 13:31.344
You are lucky
you have me here.

13:31.378 --> 13:32.579
I am going
to cover for you.

13:32.612 --> 13:34.581
All right!

13:40.420 --> 13:44.124
Good morning, Vietnam!

13:47.895 --> 13:52.866
I am not Dwight Schroot.
Not at all.

13:52.900 --> 13:56.870
I am Michael Scott,
his mentor and boss.

13:56.904 --> 13:59.206
And until Dwight comes up,

13:59.239 --> 14:02.542
if he ever does,

14:02.575 --> 14:03.643
I wanted to say
a few words

14:03.676 --> 14:06.046
about excellence.

14:06.079 --> 14:10.117
What makes
a work environment excellent?

14:10.150 --> 14:14.354
Well, there are many things,
I believe,

14:14.387 --> 14:18.091
that do such
a thing of that...nature.

14:18.125 --> 14:22.462
And one would be humor.

14:22.495 --> 14:26.266
What is the difference
between a salesman

14:26.299 --> 14:28.301
and a saleswoman?

14:37.677 --> 14:39.913
I always set it at 69.

14:41.448 --> 14:44.317
Maybe we'll use a DJ.

14:44.351 --> 14:45.585
That's the one thing
Roy's in charge of

14:45.618 --> 14:47.520
for this wedding,
but all he's managed to do

14:47.554 --> 14:48.588
is set a date.

14:48.621 --> 14:51.624
Well, he did a great job.
June 10th is perfect.

14:51.658 --> 14:52.960
I want a June wedding.

14:52.993 --> 14:55.362
I've always wanted one.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.697
Ryan, do you know when
you would want to get married?

14:57.730 --> 15:00.467
Actually, I don't see
ever getting married.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.435
Oh.

15:10.343 --> 15:11.644
Ryan, you should be
more sensitive.

15:11.678 --> 15:14.247
It's obvious she likes you,
and comments like that...

15:14.281 --> 15:16.984
I know what I said.

15:17.017 --> 15:18.551
I'm very sorry,
I did not know

15:18.585 --> 15:20.187
that you were wearing
a hearing aid.

15:20.220 --> 15:24.657
And I just thought
you were speaking abnormally.

15:24.691 --> 15:30.998
And now, the black guy from
the Police Acade movies.

15:31.031 --> 15:32.565
A robot.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.406
Michael Winslow.
Anyone?

15:40.540 --> 15:42.142
A car starting.

15:47.114 --> 15:49.416
All right,
Dwight Schroot, everyone.

15:50.450 --> 15:53.153
Good luck.
That is a tough crowd.

16:09.136 --> 16:11.504
Blood alone moves the wheels
of history!

16:14.074 --> 16:15.108
Have you ever
asked yourselves

16:15.142 --> 16:17.077
in an hour of meditation,

16:17.110 --> 16:21.181
which everyone finds
during the day,

16:21.214 --> 16:26.053
how long we have been
striving for greatness?

16:26.086 --> 16:29.056
Not only the years
we've been at war,

16:29.089 --> 16:31.224
the war of work.

16:31.258 --> 16:34.494
But from the moment,
as a child,

16:34.527 --> 16:36.296
when we realized
that the world

16:36.329 --> 16:39.232
could be conquered.

16:39.266 --> 16:42.102
It has been
a lifetime struggle.

16:42.135 --> 16:43.536
A never-ending fight.

16:43.570 --> 16:47.207
I say to you,
and you will understand,

16:47.240 --> 16:51.544
that it is
a privilege to fight!

16:56.183 --> 16:58.551
We are warriors!

17:03.356 --> 17:06.059
Salesmen of Northeastern
Pennsylvania,

17:06.093 --> 17:09.596
I ask you, once more,
rise and be worthy

17:09.629 --> 17:11.564
of this historical hour!

17:20.507 --> 17:22.242
I got a time share
on Key West

17:22.275 --> 17:25.178
that might be available.

17:25.212 --> 17:27.180
Maybe.
Thanks.

17:27.214 --> 17:28.781
You really think
you're gonna go?

17:28.815 --> 17:30.283
Yeah, I'm definitely going.

17:30.317 --> 17:33.153
Nice.
Send me a postcard.

17:33.186 --> 17:34.554
Jim has worked at the
same place for five years.

17:34.587 --> 17:36.289
Jim eats the same
ham and cheese sandwich

17:36.323 --> 17:38.191
every day for lunch.

17:38.225 --> 17:39.659
I don't know,
if I were a betting man,

17:39.692 --> 17:41.661
I'd say he will have
a fun weekend

17:41.694 --> 17:43.663
in Philadelphia.

17:49.136 --> 17:52.739
No revolution
is worth anything,

17:52.772 --> 17:56.109
unless it can
defend itself!

17:58.411 --> 18:02.482
Some people will tell you
salesman is a bad word.

18:02.515 --> 18:06.686
They'll conjure up images
of used card dealers

18:06.719 --> 18:09.256
and door to door
charlatans.

18:09.289 --> 18:13.793
This is our duty
to change their perception.

18:13.826 --> 18:17.564
I say, salesmen...
and women...

18:17.597 --> 18:20.667
of the world, unite.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.769
We must never acquiesce.

18:22.802 --> 18:24.771
For it is together!

18:24.804 --> 18:28.875
Together that we prevail!

18:28.908 --> 18:33.880
We must never cede control
of the motherland,

18:33.913 --> 18:35.782
for it is...

18:35.815 --> 18:39.752
Together that we prevail!

18:49.696 --> 18:51.431
Australia?

18:51.464 --> 18:52.799
I have always wanted
to go there.

18:52.832 --> 18:54.201
I'm going.

18:54.234 --> 18:55.502
I'm a little nervous
to run into Dwight

18:55.535 --> 18:56.869
on his connecting flight
to Mordor,

18:56.903 --> 18:58.871
but other than that...

18:58.905 --> 19:02.309
Yeah, I bought the ticket.
Non-refundable.

19:02.342 --> 19:03.810
That's awesome.
Where are you staying?

19:03.843 --> 19:05.245
I don't know.

19:05.278 --> 19:06.045
I feel like I have
plenty of time

19:06.078 --> 19:07.314
to figure out the details,
but...

19:07.347 --> 19:10.950
When are you leaving?

19:10.983 --> 19:12.219
I'm leaving on June 8th.

19:12.252 --> 19:16.223
Oh.

19:16.256 --> 19:18.891
Yeah, and I'm really sorry
about that.

19:18.925 --> 19:21.694
Oh, yeah,
that's too bad.

19:22.962 --> 19:25.698
Yeah.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.336
Do want me to take these
on my way out?

19:29.369 --> 19:30.737
It's okay, I got it.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.672
All right.

19:35.275 --> 19:36.509
Thanks.

19:38.278 --> 19:39.246
Okay.

19:39.279 --> 19:40.480
There you are.
What happened?

19:40.513 --> 19:42.482
I got thirsty.
How'd it go?

19:42.515 --> 19:43.483
It was amazing.

19:43.516 --> 19:44.451
I wish you
would have been there.

19:44.484 --> 19:47.220
You would not believe
what happened here.

19:47.254 --> 19:48.054
What, did something happen?

19:48.087 --> 19:52.892
Oh, this woman came in.
Sat down.

19:52.925 --> 19:53.993
Ordered a drink.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.862
The bartender
asked for her ID,

19:55.895 --> 19:56.896
which I thought was odd.

19:56.929 --> 19:57.897
Because I pegged her as,
like, 35.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.832
Weird.
Yeah, really weird.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.801
So, she's like,
I don't have my ID.

20:01.834 --> 20:02.935
Please give me one.

20:02.969 --> 20:03.903
And he's like,
I can't do that.

20:03.936 --> 20:05.572
I can't serve you.

20:05.605 --> 20:07.407
Con artist.
She might have been.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.809
So she says fine,
I will go to my room.

20:09.842 --> 20:11.611
I will get my purse.
I will come back.

20:11.644 --> 20:12.612
I'll show you my ID.

20:12.645 --> 20:14.013
She hasn't come back yet.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.983
She's probably in the room
drinking from the minibar.

20:18.985 --> 20:20.887
Dwight gave a great speech.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.989
That's the word
on the street, anyway.

20:23.022 --> 20:26.326
And I entertained Dwight
to no end

20:26.359 --> 20:27.694
with my bar story.

20:27.727 --> 20:32.799
So I captivated the guy
who captivated 1,000 guys.

20:32.832 --> 20:34.834
Can you believe that?
1,000 guys.
