00:44.458 --> 00:46.166
It's your turn.

00:47.416 --> 00:51.083
1.8 times 10 to the 10th.
Your most beautiful day.

00:52.458 --> 00:54.833
Sent.

03:06.333 --> 03:09.541
Thank you, Mr. Chan,
the pleasure's all mine.

03:09.916 --> 03:12.416
New message.
Leon's waiting for you.

03:13.875 --> 03:15.791
Great. Wonderful.

03:17.166 --> 03:20.208
Then have a nice day
and goodbye.

03:24.208 --> 03:27.791
So what is hydraulic fracturing?

03:28.166 --> 03:30.916
I have no idea.
But Google does.

03:32.416 --> 03:34.166
I'll be home soon.

03:34.541 --> 03:35.708
Happy Birthday.

03:38.666 --> 03:41.791
I thought we said no presents.
- Looks like you were low.

03:42.166 --> 03:45.083
I wanted to make sure you have
enough emergency supplies.

03:47.333 --> 03:49.083
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

04:22.416 --> 04:25.833
...more dangerous pathologies.
One thing we learned about...

04:31.083 --> 04:32.375
Katja?
- I didn't do that!

04:32.666 --> 04:34.833
If it's a surprise party,
your vacation is off.

04:35.208 --> 04:36.833
It wasn't me. Really.

05:01.791 --> 05:02.875
What happened?

05:03.250 --> 05:06.500
As far as I know
there's a blackout in the whole city.

05:09.166 --> 05:12.458
Ladies and gentlemen,
we'll get this under control in no time.

05:12.666 --> 05:16.875
Stay calm and I'll get the
information off as soon as I have it.

05:17.416 --> 05:18.833
Anyone stuck in the elevators?

05:19.000 --> 05:21.208
We're not sure.
- Have a look.

05:21.583 --> 05:23.625
What's the hell's going on?
- Mr. Rosenberg...

05:24.000 --> 05:25.708
I want the lights on.
We're in a conference.

05:25.916 --> 05:28.708
I'm terribly sorry.
- We need them out of here.

05:30.125 --> 05:33.333
- We're trying to fix this asap.
- I promise. - Fix it?

05:33.750 --> 05:34.958
Where's your generator? Come on!

05:35.333 --> 05:38.625
The generator?
What happened to the generator?

05:41.541 --> 05:43.208
Are you all right?
- You think so?

05:43.708 --> 05:46.291
I tripped on loose carpet.
You should fix that.

05:46.666 --> 05:49.708
Look what happened! -
Any idea what these people have paid?

05:50.083 --> 05:52.916
I must take care
of this man. Excuse me...

05:53.291 --> 05:56.833
You'll pay for this, you know.
- Here's my card. Franke's my name.

05:57.208 --> 06:00.541
Any problems, please, give me a call.
Katja, please help this gentleman.

06:00.916 --> 06:03.708
This way.
- I'll sue you, you hear?

06:04.083 --> 06:07.291
Loud and clear, Mr. Rosenberg,
but we'll take care of this, I promise.

06:07.666 --> 06:10.166
What can we do?
Would you like a drink? - A drink!

06:10.541 --> 06:12.708
Everybody in this room
deserves a drink now.

06:13.083 --> 06:15.791
On the house, right?
- It's a plan. - That's a plan.

06:16.166 --> 06:21.083
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a blackout all over Berlin

06:21.500 --> 06:23.375
but I'm sure
the lights will be back soon.

06:23.958 --> 06:26.750
But meanwhile I'd like to ask you
to please be patient.

06:27.125 --> 06:30.125
We have flashlights and candles.
Please help yourselves.

06:30.541 --> 06:33.791
We invite you for a drink.
- Everybody to the bar,

06:34.166 --> 06:37.416
follow me.
Champagne is best served cold.

06:43.541 --> 06:45.291
Network overload.

06:45.666 --> 06:46.583
Come on!

06:48.041 --> 06:52.000
Are you okay?
I'll be there soon.

07:28.250 --> 07:30.208
Happy birthday!
- Johnny, are you crazy?

07:32.000 --> 07:37.000
Chickenshit scaredy-pants,
my friend. Shoulda seen your face.

07:37.625 --> 07:39.875
Good to see you.
- Come inside, birthday boy.

07:40.250 --> 07:42.666
Beeper to Robbie...
The Old Man has landed.

07:42.958 --> 07:44.625
Awesome, roger.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.750
Everything okay?
- Okay here?

07:47.125 --> 07:48.208
Daddy's home.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.583
Daddy!
- Hey, big boy. Still awake?

07:52.958 --> 07:54.708
I thought you'd put him to bed.
- I'm the godfather.

07:55.083 --> 07:56.791
I thought he could stay up.
So sue me!

07:57.166 --> 08:00.166
I want to congratulate Daddy first.
- To my birthday!

08:01.500 --> 08:02.833
How old am I?

08:03.208 --> 08:05.791
Daddy's as old as the hills.

08:06.166 --> 08:08.791
Now off to bed with you.

08:09.291 --> 08:12.958
Here he comes.

08:13.875 --> 08:16.833
Bye. All the best, Lukas,
but I gotta get going.

08:17.208 --> 08:19.375
Johnny talked
about the stadium again.

08:19.750 --> 08:22.333
I don't wanna die.
- Come on, calm down.

08:22.708 --> 08:24.000
I think it's a great story.

08:24.375 --> 08:25.791
Again.

08:26.166 --> 08:28.708
The whole stadium,
all evacuated,

08:29.083 --> 08:30.083
They said it's a bomb.

08:30.750 --> 08:33.250
Nobody knows what's up.
Everyone's panicking.

08:34.166 --> 08:35.125
Not us.

08:35.708 --> 08:38.041
Didn't you text me saying,
"We're all going to die"?

08:38.416 --> 08:39.750
Yeah, you did.
- That's not the point.

08:40.666 --> 08:42.791
We only just missed
a terrorist attack.

08:43.291 --> 08:45.541
We could have all been killed.
- Maybe it was aliens.

08:45.916 --> 08:48.833
No.
This was a hack. I always said

08:49.208 --> 08:51.583
one day they'll hack
the whole city.

08:52.458 --> 08:54.583
Do you have any normal friends,
Lukas?

09:02.333 --> 09:03.750
Leon?

09:08.250 --> 09:12.041
You really have to go to bed now.
- I don't feel like sleeping.

09:12.416 --> 09:14.458
What's behind your back there?

09:15.291 --> 09:17.250
Can I try it on, please?

09:17.625 --> 09:19.625
You can, but then off to bed.
Come on.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.041
Okay.
- Do I get a kiss?

09:22.500 --> 09:24.791
Only computers...
- Oh.

09:25.083 --> 09:27.333
Oh...
- Alright, cake.

09:27.708 --> 09:30.833
So, darling, we know you don't
like celebrating your birthday,

09:31.208 --> 09:33.750
but we do, so...
- Speech!

09:34.125 --> 09:36.750
Don't worry, speeches aren't me.

09:37.458 --> 09:40.000
I love you. Happy birthday.

09:50.041 --> 09:52.208
All right! Aw!

09:56.041 --> 09:59.291
Oh nice!
- Hey. - About time.

09:59.666 --> 10:02.125
Man!

10:03.000 --> 10:06.083
Software flaw caused blackout
in Berlin. Blah blah blah.

10:06.458 --> 10:08.416
At least
everything's back to normal.

10:08.791 --> 10:11.666
Dear Mr. Franke, attached
please find my contact details,

10:12.041 --> 10:14.541
Best. Kaufmann.
Download complete.

10:27.083 --> 10:27.958
I'm nervous.

10:28.333 --> 10:30.416
For you.
- Thanks.

10:44.750 --> 10:46.125
I love you.

10:47.208 --> 10:48.750
Our most beautiful day.

10:50.583 --> 10:51.708
Happiness.

10:57.500 --> 10:58.958
You like it?

11:05.000 --> 11:06.041
Mommy?

11:07.500 --> 11:11.625
Yes? - I'm scared of the aliens.
- What aliens?

11:12.333 --> 11:16.250
The ones who switched off the lights.
- That was just a joke, sweetheart.

11:16.875 --> 11:19.375
You know there are
no bad aliens, right? - No.

11:19.750 --> 11:24.000
Don't you know the story? - No.
- You can't be serious.

11:24.791 --> 11:27.250
I have to tell you.
- Keep it short.

11:27.625 --> 11:28.666
Good night.

11:29.375 --> 11:32.083
On the edge
of our galaxy is a planet

11:32.458 --> 11:34.750
called Gobo,
where there once lived...

11:36.458 --> 11:39.583
Since then evil aliens are no more.
- What if there are?

11:39.875 --> 11:43.500
I'm here to protect you. So you're safe.
- What are you gonna do?

11:43.833 --> 11:47.750
I'll knock them hard on their heads.
- Then what?

11:48.125 --> 11:49.708
Then they'll fly back into space

11:50.083 --> 11:53.666
and tell their alien buddies
not to mess with Leon Franke.

11:56.791 --> 11:59.666
Okay, that makes sense.
- Know what else makes sense?

12:01.166 --> 12:02.625
Sleep.

12:03.083 --> 12:04.333
Love you, Daddy.

12:05.083 --> 12:07.416
Love you too. Good night.
- Good night.

12:22.750 --> 12:24.083
And what about us?

13:53.291 --> 13:57.083
Switch it off.

14:07.541 --> 14:10.500
You're now connected
to the group Antipode.

14:10.875 --> 14:14.875
The blackout was just the beginning.
New York Times reported it.

14:18.291 --> 14:22.000
Our 15 minutes of fame.
Ha ha ha!

14:25.166 --> 14:27.125
Leave group
and erase all content?

15:06.125 --> 15:07.500
Will it be hectic today?

15:08.125 --> 15:09.833
Depends on who sues us
after the blackout.

15:10.083 --> 15:12.625
Could you drop Leon
off today? - What?

15:13.000 --> 15:14.500
Pretty please.

15:15.458 --> 15:17.666
Want me to take you? - Yes!
- Grab your stuff.

15:18.041 --> 15:20.375
We're off.
- Thanks. - No problem.

15:20.708 --> 15:23.041
Okay. Love you.

15:23.416 --> 15:25.625
Take care, sweetie.
- See you later.

15:25.791 --> 15:27.666
Bye. - Bye honey.
- Have a good day.

15:28.041 --> 15:29.000
Attack!
- Bye.

15:30.333 --> 15:31.541
The mayor spoke this morning

15:31.916 --> 15:37.625
attempting to keep the city current
on this chaotic chain of events.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.541
A shocking experience
that rattled the very core of the city.

15:41.916 --> 15:44.916
1000s of commuters were stranded...

15:45.291 --> 15:46.166
Hold on.

15:46.833 --> 15:48.333
One moment!

15:55.833 --> 15:59.541
Mrs. Franke?
- Yes. What's that? - Package.

16:00.291 --> 16:01.666
Your signature please.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.958
Thank you.

16:37.958 --> 16:39.500
Of course this was an emergency,

16:39.875 --> 16:44.416
but we must learn to handle situations
in a responsible and professional...

16:45.375 --> 16:47.833
Well, hello!
How nice you could make it.

16:48.208 --> 16:51.375
Sorry. You okay?
- I spent the night drinking champagne.

16:51.750 --> 16:53.708
Back to the blackout.
- What?

16:54.000 --> 16:57.416
Got any meds?
- Challenges are managers' best friend.

16:57.791 --> 17:00.291
Thanks.
- Speaking of friends,

17:00.666 --> 17:02.250
our beloved customer
Mr. Rosenberg

17:02.625 --> 17:05.375
is asking us
for a rather large refund

17:05.916 --> 17:07.500
due to the blackout.

17:07.875 --> 17:11.500
On the other hand Mr. Franke,
who isn't paying attention,

17:11.875 --> 17:14.500
was in a very generous mood
last night.

17:14.875 --> 17:18.916
He left a 20,000 dollar tab
at the bar.

17:20.125 --> 17:22.708
This causes me real pain.

17:22.958 --> 17:24.083
Sorry!
- Can you explain

17:24.458 --> 17:27.791
why we had the pleasure?
- Damage control?

17:28.166 --> 17:29.875
Damage control.

17:31.750 --> 17:33.291
Are we talking
about the auto industry?

17:38.500 --> 17:40.375
A blackout
throughout the whole city.

17:40.750 --> 17:42.208
Orgies in the street.

17:42.625 --> 17:45.916
Anarchy... And I was
sitting in a garden party,

17:46.291 --> 17:49.208
in the world's most boring place.
- Thanks, Vero.

17:49.916 --> 17:51.166
You know what I mean.

17:53.041 --> 17:56.000
And you mean it.
- Did Lukas turn 95?

17:56.333 --> 17:58.500
What was going on?
- Is it lunchtime?

17:58.875 --> 18:00.166
Vero, you hungry?
- Yes,

18:00.541 --> 18:02.291
but not like you think.

18:02.666 --> 18:04.666
Is that a yes, or...
- We'll catch up.

18:06.041 --> 18:07.083
Okay, cool.

18:09.291 --> 18:11.000
Why do you bust his chops?

18:12.416 --> 18:15.416
He totally loves it.
He just doesn't know it.

18:17.208 --> 18:18.666
Let's go.

18:19.458 --> 18:22.500
I'll join you in a moment.
- Okay.

18:33.625 --> 18:36.791
I'm gone
for two goddam days,

18:37.166 --> 18:40.000
and everything goes to hell.

18:40.375 --> 18:42.958
Do I have
to do everything myself?

18:43.333 --> 18:45.541
Ever heard of responsibility?

18:45.916 --> 18:49.250
Are you kidding me?
- Wanna play a game?

18:51.083 --> 18:54.000
Yes, no...

18:55.375 --> 18:58.083
What's going on over there?
- Pity...

18:59.375 --> 19:01.750
Franke!

19:06.083 --> 19:07.875
What are you doing?

19:14.208 --> 19:15.250
Franke!

19:16.916 --> 19:18.000
I gotta go.

19:20.416 --> 19:21.750
Franke!

19:56.250 --> 19:57.708
Hanna?
- Hey!

19:59.333 --> 20:01.583
Where are you?
- Running errands.

20:01.958 --> 20:04.583
Why did you order
electronics for 800 dollars?

20:06.791 --> 20:09.916
I didn't order anything.
- Well a package came.

20:10.291 --> 20:13.625
The money's gone from our account.
- Must be a mistake.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.041
I'll look into it later.
- Okay.

20:17.083 --> 20:18.541
Goodbye.
- Bye.

20:51.208 --> 20:55.458
I'll need a photo ID.
And fill out this form please.

20:55.833 --> 20:57.458
No problem.

20:59.083 --> 21:01.125
Here.
- Thank you.

21:12.333 --> 21:13.875
Here you go.
- Thank you.

21:18.625 --> 21:21.791
Thank you.
- That'll be 230.90 then.

21:31.791 --> 21:34.041
Here's your change.
- Thanks.

21:34.416 --> 21:37.625
First carefully cover the meat,

21:38.000 --> 21:40.958
then perform the same procedure
with the breadcrumbs.

21:41.333 --> 21:45.166
If you like you can also
put some minced olives

21:45.541 --> 21:48.041
and artichokes in the mix...
- Three new messages.

21:50.458 --> 21:52.958
thank you for the night.

22:00.625 --> 22:02.708
Daddy!

22:05.125 --> 22:08.083
Noah's getting an RC car
for the first day of school.

22:08.458 --> 22:12.083
Sounds like it would cost a lot.
- Not too much. Can I get one?

22:13.458 --> 22:14.708
What does Mommy say?

22:15.375 --> 22:16.833
I'll ask her now.

22:17.958 --> 22:19.166
Okay.

22:19.541 --> 22:22.166
Can I get an RC car?
- Sweetie,

22:22.541 --> 22:25.791
you can get something little,
but an RC car is for Santa.

22:26.166 --> 22:28.458
You told me I could
wish for something, so...

22:29.333 --> 22:32.375
You can eat in front of the TV.
- Okay.

22:32.958 --> 22:34.250
You need help?

22:35.666 --> 22:38.250
Scratch off the black stuff,
cover it in ketchup,

22:38.625 --> 22:40.791
and we're all set.

22:58.708 --> 23:00.166
Is something wrong?

23:01.500 --> 23:03.875
There may be. Why don't you
tell me if there is.

23:05.625 --> 23:07.791
Look what we got.

23:13.333 --> 23:16.833
What's this?
- Who is Julia?

23:17.333 --> 23:19.125
I don't know any Julia.

23:21.833 --> 23:24.875
You really think that? You think...
- What should I think?

23:25.625 --> 23:26.958
That I love you?

23:28.208 --> 23:31.416
That I don't care about
anyone but Hanna. Hanna, listen!

23:31.791 --> 23:34.625
I don't know...
- So why's she naked on our tablet?

23:35.000 --> 23:37.041
Spam, phishing mail?

23:38.250 --> 23:40.875
Somebody must have hacked
our computers.

23:41.375 --> 23:42.916
Tell you what.

23:44.791 --> 23:46.333
I'll fix it.

23:56.291 --> 23:58.333
Change password.

24:02.250 --> 24:03.791
Start virus scan.

24:13.166 --> 24:15.625
Installation in progress.

24:50.166 --> 24:52.416
System successfully installed.

25:00.041 --> 25:01.416
I refreshed all devices,

25:01.708 --> 25:05.583
reinstalled programs and changed your
passwords, including child protection.

25:05.958 --> 25:08.875
Your new password is February 7.
Your birthday.

25:09.250 --> 25:10.750
Correct, right?

25:13.458 --> 25:15.375
Come on, let's go to bed.

25:28.500 --> 25:31.625
Switch off Berlin.
Antipode attacks.

25:47.750 --> 25:49.833
Accident at hotel.

25:50.208 --> 25:53.875
Attached find my details.
Best. Kaufmann.

26:29.583 --> 26:32.166
Congress participants.
Heart surgeons.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.208
Cannot open, file damaged.

27:11.708 --> 27:14.458
Hello? You've reached
Jens Kaufmann's voicemail.

27:14.833 --> 27:16.666
Sorry,
I'm not available right now.

27:17.041 --> 27:18.833
Please leave a message
after the beep.

27:19.208 --> 27:21.875
Also please be aware
that everything you say

27:22.250 --> 27:24.666
may be recorded
by the NSA and Company.

27:25.041 --> 27:28.083
This service is free of charge
to you. Thank you.

28:00.666 --> 28:04.416
We gotta talk. -
Professor Lovebird, I'm waiting.

28:05.125 --> 28:06.583
Oh.

28:08.541 --> 28:10.000
Who's that?

28:10.458 --> 28:11.916
Nobody.

28:13.166 --> 28:15.625
I don't know what he
promised you, but...

28:16.000 --> 28:18.500
that's not gonna happen.

28:30.708 --> 28:32.500
You gotta help me.
- Why should I care?

28:32.875 --> 28:35.875
You think I have nothing
better to do than help you?

28:37.083 --> 28:39.708
I'm here 'cause it's important.
- Wow!

28:41.166 --> 28:43.041
We haven't spoken
to each other in years

28:43.875 --> 28:45.083
but to be totally honest

28:45.916 --> 28:47.666
I'm really okay with that.

28:48.041 --> 28:50.875
Thomas, please, listen!
This is serious.

28:51.250 --> 28:52.500
I've been hacked.

28:54.125 --> 28:55.375
Why d'you come to me?

28:59.458 --> 29:01.041
Ask Dalton!

29:09.916 --> 29:11.166
Do you dream?

29:14.333 --> 29:15.791
What's that?

29:16.583 --> 29:19.041
Do you dream? At night.

29:22.791 --> 29:24.083
Why ask?

29:25.458 --> 29:28.666
Two thirds of all people
don't remember if they dream.

29:30.708 --> 29:32.666
Do you dream, Mr. Franke?

29:34.208 --> 29:35.958
What do you want from me?

29:38.333 --> 29:40.500
To find what gets you off.

29:44.333 --> 29:46.791
To get inside your skull.

29:48.666 --> 29:51.291
I want to know
everything you know.

29:52.125 --> 29:54.166
Let's start
with a simple question.

29:55.541 --> 29:58.291
How's your brother
connected to Dalton?

30:09.625 --> 30:13.250
I don't know.
I think he was one of his clients.

30:13.625 --> 30:17.208
Ah...
And what is his real name?

30:18.750 --> 30:22.583
Everybody just called
him Dalton. I never asked.

30:25.541 --> 30:28.333
And you went to see Dalton,
did you?

30:28.708 --> 30:30.041
Why?

30:31.291 --> 30:35.041
He's an expert.
I'm clueless about this stuff.

30:35.916 --> 30:37.833
I get nervous
updating computer software.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.416
So do I.

30:42.583 --> 30:48.541
But updates are important.
Otherwise you're vulnerable.

31:39.791 --> 31:42.541
I'm looking for Dalton. Is he here?
- He's not here.

31:43.958 --> 31:47.458
He has to track a phone number for me.
- There's no Dalton here.

31:51.208 --> 31:52.416
Yes!

31:52.791 --> 31:54.041
I got hacked.

31:54.416 --> 31:56.333
Someone is threatening
my family.

31:56.708 --> 31:59.250
They take photos of my son
and money from my account.

31:59.625 --> 32:01.958
I don't know what to do.
That's why I'm here.

32:03.625 --> 32:05.375
Can anyone
track a number for me?

32:05.666 --> 32:08.625
His name is Jens Kaufmann.
- He's not here.

32:12.333 --> 32:15.083
Yes, but you could...
- We use public data only,

32:15.458 --> 32:17.708
we don't go after individuals.
No exceptions.

32:18.166 --> 32:21.291
Even if they're assholes?
- Maybe you're the asshole.

32:24.291 --> 32:26.083
Come on. Please!
- No!

32:26.958 --> 32:28.583
Yes! Bullseye.

32:29.125 --> 32:31.291
You don't want to.
- Sorry.

32:32.416 --> 32:33.375
Rules are rules.

32:34.583 --> 32:35.958
Catch you later.

32:52.625 --> 32:54.291
Let's go.

32:56.541 --> 32:58.916
Who are you?
- Start driving! - Who are you?

32:59.875 --> 33:01.791
Drive and then I'll tell you.

33:21.166 --> 33:24.291
How did you get in here?
- It was open.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.125
Right here.

33:42.583 --> 33:43.833
Are you Dalton?

33:44.833 --> 33:46.833
I heard what you said.

33:47.791 --> 33:48.833
I'll help.

33:50.041 --> 33:51.541
Give me the number.

33:57.208 --> 33:59.208
We could have talked
back there.

33:59.583 --> 34:02.000
There are things
you don't say in the open.

34:11.291 --> 34:14.291
I know Jens Kaufmann.
Alias Case.

34:16.750 --> 34:19.500
We're hacktivists. Get it?

34:21.416 --> 34:22.583
Hacktivists.

34:25.125 --> 34:29.666
Kaufmann was a crasher, you know?
He wasn't into this lowlife shit.

34:30.250 --> 34:32.083
Oil, pharma...

34:32.916 --> 34:34.291
Whole systems.

34:36.333 --> 34:38.500
Man, Case and me.

34:39.916 --> 34:42.958
Everything I know,
I learned from him.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.666
I mean he showed me.

34:47.041 --> 34:50.708
Everything.
Case is one of the good ones.

34:51.166 --> 34:53.083
The good ones?
- He's a white hat, man.

34:53.375 --> 34:56.333
Soft targets like you
aren't his thing.

34:56.708 --> 35:00.166
You're not his style. No offense...
- I don't care. I just want it to stop.

35:01.791 --> 35:05.875
He's a white hat, man. - What does he
want from me? - I don't know.

35:07.875 --> 35:09.875
I've lost contact with him.

35:17.750 --> 35:18.875
Right here.

35:19.333 --> 35:23.000
You'll find him there.
Go to Case. He'll explain everything.

35:23.833 --> 35:24.916
Thank you.

35:29.500 --> 35:31.250
Hey! Wait.

35:31.625 --> 35:33.291
How will I find you?

35:35.416 --> 35:36.833
You'll find me.

36:08.208 --> 36:09.708
Hanna?
- Hey.

36:10.083 --> 36:13.416
Where are you? - I got the address
of the guy behind this.

36:13.791 --> 36:15.666
I'm on my way to him.
- On your way?

36:16.041 --> 36:18.041
Are you crazy?
Go to the police instead.

36:18.416 --> 36:20.875
I can't file a complaint
against a stranger sending

36:21.250 --> 36:22.916
photos of nude girls
and packages.

36:23.791 --> 36:26.833
I have to take care of this myself.
- That's too dangerous.

36:27.625 --> 36:30.875
You've no idea who he is.
- Trust me. I'll handle it.

36:31.250 --> 36:32.875
I love you. Bye.

37:14.083 --> 37:15.333
Excuse me?

37:16.041 --> 37:18.541
What?
- I'm looking for Jens Kaufmann.

37:19.500 --> 37:21.958
How come?
- I have to talk to him.

37:22.750 --> 37:24.666
You're too late for that.

37:25.041 --> 37:26.916
The guy's dead.

37:27.750 --> 37:31.250
It was really bad. He jumped
out the window in flames.

37:35.125 --> 37:36.000
When?

37:36.458 --> 37:37.916
A month ago.

37:42.916 --> 37:44.708
So, the question is

37:45.083 --> 37:47.000
what killed him, right?

37:47.375 --> 37:50.625
The fire ,or the impact
down there?

38:01.166 --> 38:03.708
There must be a reason
she only showed her tits.

38:04.083 --> 38:06.541
Let's have a look.
Titty Julia.

38:07.500 --> 38:08.416
Man!

38:08.791 --> 38:10.458
Look at all the titty Julias.

38:11.541 --> 38:14.041
If she's the one,
you have no chance.

38:14.416 --> 38:16.333
No chance at all.

38:23.875 --> 38:25.541
Hey. Everything okay?

38:25.916 --> 38:27.916
The guy
doesn't live there anymore.

38:28.916 --> 38:31.875
I'll go get the computer
and we'll go to the police.

38:32.250 --> 38:35.000
I'm meeting a client at the Fisherman's.
Can you pick me up?

38:35.625 --> 38:37.875
Sure, see you there. Love you.
- Love you.

38:42.333 --> 38:44.666
Yes, Aunt Vero's
canceling her date.

38:45.041 --> 38:48.541
Who needs sex when you can
watch "Toy Story" for the tenth time?

38:49.166 --> 38:50.875
Vero, you're the best.

39:39.125 --> 39:41.208
Baseball bat down.
- Who are you?

39:43.708 --> 39:44.750
Criminal investigation.

39:45.833 --> 39:47.208
Come on. Bat down.

39:48.291 --> 39:49.583
Why are you in my home?

39:59.458 --> 40:00.416
Search warrant.

40:07.833 --> 40:08.750
Search warrant?

40:09.958 --> 40:12.083
Hey! No smoking!
- Why don't you sit down?

40:12.625 --> 40:14.708
I don't want to.
Tell me what's going on.

40:15.083 --> 40:16.583
Shhhh.

40:16.958 --> 40:19.750
My colleagues needed to look around.
- Why me?

40:29.250 --> 40:31.166
Okay, listen...

40:31.541 --> 40:33.666
Someone's been hacking me
for two days.

40:34.041 --> 40:37.041
I was about to file a complaint.
- Perfect.

40:37.416 --> 40:39.625
So here we are!

40:45.458 --> 40:47.500
How soon can you do it?

40:48.083 --> 40:50.541
Realistically, in a week.

40:52.166 --> 40:55.291
Okay. Write how much money
you want on your napkin.

40:55.625 --> 40:59.458
If my napkin reads more,
do the job in three days.

40:59.833 --> 41:02.833
And poor me
if your number is higher. - Okay.

41:25.875 --> 41:27.000
More.

41:31.291 --> 41:34.541
Okay. Three days. Layouts only.

41:34.916 --> 41:38.250
It should be right to the point.
We run a tight schedule.

41:38.750 --> 41:39.916
Deal?

41:40.291 --> 41:41.791
I'll do my best.

41:45.625 --> 41:47.250
The check, please.

41:47.958 --> 41:50.291
Can I give you a ride somewhere?

41:50.875 --> 41:52.875
I already have a ride, I think.

41:53.250 --> 41:55.291
Can I at least buy you a drink?

41:55.583 --> 41:59.875
That's nice, but you must be busy.
- You'd be doing me a favor.

42:00.250 --> 42:03.083
I'd rather not have to
go back to the office right away.

42:11.166 --> 42:12.666
So, Franke,

42:13.250 --> 42:16.250
are you a member of Antipode?

42:17.041 --> 42:20.416
Antipode?
- Mhm. - What's that?

42:20.791 --> 42:23.791
The group that's claiming
the recent blackout was them.

42:25.458 --> 42:27.041
No. I don't have a clue.

42:31.708 --> 42:35.250
But how could they claim responsibility
from your IP address?

42:35.791 --> 42:38.833
I told you already,
I got hacked.

42:44.708 --> 42:47.791
Do you know what
a "warning to troublemakers" is?

42:48.750 --> 42:52.583
Imagine someone who's planning
a felony. We know that,

42:53.458 --> 42:55.708
but we need more evidence.

42:56.458 --> 42:59.208
Let's assume
this someone is you.

43:00.125 --> 43:02.750
Then you can take
our conversation as a warning.

43:03.125 --> 43:06.666
In other words, you better stop
whatever you're planning.

43:08.958 --> 43:10.583
Do you understand?

43:15.166 --> 43:16.708
What is it I'm planning to do?

43:17.916 --> 43:19.083
You're going to build a bomb.

43:21.500 --> 43:23.583
What? Building a bomb?

43:24.083 --> 43:27.291
Me building a bomb! This is crazy.

43:28.041 --> 43:29.500
By any chance...

43:29.833 --> 43:32.125
do you know this man?
