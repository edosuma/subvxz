WEBVTT

00:01.935 --> 00:04.505
What?
He left you
his practice.

00:04.505 --> 00:08.242
Mom, what about Harley?
Why not tell me about him?
Can we just go home

00:08.242 --> 00:10.911
and discuss this in therapy
like normal people?

00:10.911 --> 00:12.680
You go.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.482
I'm staying here.
LAVON: If I do recall,

00:14.482 --> 00:16.817
we are at your
 engagement party.

00:16.817 --> 00:19.687
You know how difficult
this is for me.
Difficult never stopped me.

00:19.687 --> 00:21.555
This needs to stop.
I can't handle it.

00:21.555 --> 00:24.158
What do you want from me here?
I'm trying to move on,

00:24.158 --> 00:26.094
and you won't let me.
(sobbing)

00:26.094 --> 00:28.129
Lemon, I love you,
and I love BlueBell.

00:28.129 --> 00:32.566
What's this?
I think it's time we start
looking for a house, don't you?

00:37.171 --> 00:39.173
WADE:
Hey, Doc,

00:39.173 --> 00:42.610
meant to thank you for
blowing out the electricity
at my place last night.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.612
It's good to practice
living off the grid

00:44.612 --> 00:48.449
in case of a war with
the zombies or whatnot.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.052
(gasps)

00:52.052 --> 00:53.221
(laughing)

00:53.221 --> 00:54.955
Look, you can eat here
and drink here,

00:54.955 --> 00:57.525
but if you sleep here
I'm going to have to
charge you hotel tax.

00:57.525 --> 01:00.661
I'm sorry.
I haven't been sleeping lately.

01:00.661 --> 01:03.097
I've been lying in bed at night
just listening

01:03.097 --> 01:05.633
to my mosquitoes die
in my new bug zapper.

01:05.633 --> 01:08.402
Well, listen, maybe you're just
not tired enough at night.

01:08.402 --> 01:11.205
If you want to work out
a little, or whatever.

01:11.205 --> 01:13.674
No need to blow the power out.
I'll just come by.

01:13.674 --> 01:17.478
Great. The mosquitoes will show
you where to go.

01:20.548 --> 01:22.550
Okay, now we are all
set for my trip

01:22.550 --> 01:25.018
just as soon
as I deliver this baby.

01:25.018 --> 01:26.420
Women-- I never
understand, why do they

01:26.420 --> 01:29.623
insist on having babies
during the football season?

01:29.623 --> 01:30.624
MAGNOLIA:
Daddy.

01:30.624 --> 01:31.992
Hey, Magnolia honey.

01:31.992 --> 01:35.363
Have you come to see me before
I take off on the football trip?

01:35.363 --> 01:38.832
Yes. Plus I wanted to show
you the new dress I bought.

01:38.832 --> 01:40.334
Isn't it cute?

01:40.334 --> 01:42.002
Well, yes, that is, uh...

01:42.002 --> 01:43.137
cute, yeah.

01:43.137 --> 01:45.105
Did your sister see that?
I knew it.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.241
Always running off to Daddy when
you don't get your way.

01:47.241 --> 01:48.709
He said my dress was cute.

01:48.709 --> 01:51.712
Daddy, this dress shows places
that only God should see.

01:51.712 --> 01:54.915
It's like something
that Zoe Hart would wear.

01:54.915 --> 01:57.084
ZOE:
Hey!

01:57.084 --> 02:00.188
Magnolia said that she would
march right back to the store

02:00.188 --> 02:01.722
and go return it, but now she's

02:01.722 --> 02:03.857
just traipsing around in it
so they won't take it back.

02:03.857 --> 02:07.795
Just because I want to
dress like I live in
2011, and not 1950...

02:07.795 --> 02:08.929
Stop, stop.

02:08.929 --> 02:10.631
Stop, now, stop.

02:10.631 --> 02:13.267
Look, I have to get on the road.

02:13.267 --> 02:14.368
So just...

02:14.368 --> 02:17.538
Whatever your sister
says is fine.

02:17.538 --> 02:21.209
Oh, my God, you're
ruining my life.

02:21.209 --> 02:23.444
Hey...
Daddy!

02:23.444 --> 02:26.814
What?
Thank you.

02:28.182 --> 02:29.350
What? I...

02:29.350 --> 02:30.451
I backed her up.

02:30.451 --> 02:32.520
Don't look at me,
I got boys.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.322
By the time they've
thought up a lie,

02:34.322 --> 02:36.757
they've forgotten
what they were lying about.

02:39.159 --> 02:42.162
(phone ringing)

02:43.063 --> 02:44.898
You need to stop
ignoring your mom.

02:44.898 --> 02:46.234
I'm not.

02:46.234 --> 02:48.101
I just saw your phone--
it said "Mom."

02:48.101 --> 02:49.370
You were reading it upside down.

02:49.370 --> 02:51.572
I was ignoring my Chinese friend
Wow.

02:51.572 --> 02:53.574
You haven't talked to her
since she left BlueBell.

02:53.574 --> 02:55.576
And she's not giving up,
you know.

02:55.576 --> 02:57.611
She is calling you
twice a day now.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.780
Yeah, well, I'm not talking
to her twice a day.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.915
I'm keeping up.
You said
you're not sleeping.

03:01.915 --> 03:03.317
So?

03:03.317 --> 03:05.152
Troubled sleep means
a troubled mind.

03:05.152 --> 03:07.788
And you won't quiet yours
until you can forgive her.

03:07.788 --> 03:10.123
Forgive her, Addy?

03:10.123 --> 03:12.393
She lied to me about
who my father was.

03:12.393 --> 03:14.127
She just wants to feel better.

03:14.127 --> 03:15.996
I don't feel better,
why should she?

03:15.996 --> 03:17.398
Because you won't get any peace

03:17.398 --> 03:18.999
until you face
what's bothering you.

03:18.999 --> 03:20.901
I know what's bothering me--

03:20.901 --> 03:23.504
a crazy nurse
who won't leave me alone.

03:23.504 --> 03:25.339
Well, I just talked to the
Colyer woman again.

03:25.339 --> 03:27.708
Her contractions are
still seven minutes apart.

03:27.708 --> 03:28.809
Now, where's the oxytocin?

03:28.809 --> 03:30.778
Whoa, why are you
inducing labor?

03:30.778 --> 03:33.881
Well, because when I said I'd
cover the pregnancy for Dr. Troy

03:33.881 --> 03:36.517
over in Bristol, he promised me
I would not miss

03:36.517 --> 03:38.286
the Alabama-Florida
football game.

03:38.286 --> 03:41.455
You're going to induce
labor just so you can
make a football game?

03:41.455 --> 03:42.723
No.
She's past due.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.157
I'm practically
doing the woman a favor.

03:44.157 --> 03:46.193
All right, fine,
I'll take the birth

03:46.193 --> 03:47.561
when it's time.

03:47.561 --> 03:50.431
I'm not sleeping much anyway.
I might as well.

03:50.431 --> 03:51.932
I don't want to put you out.

03:51.932 --> 03:53.967
Don't pretend like
this wasn't your plan.

03:53.967 --> 03:56.737
Where's the address?
I have it right here.

03:56.737 --> 03:59.840
Uh, you know, this does not
go on your patient count,

03:59.840 --> 04:01.909
'cause we're covering
for Dr. Troy.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.577
You're welcome.

04:07.515 --> 04:08.782
Lavon. Hi.
Two things.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.518
One, please replace
the fuse box.

04:10.518 --> 04:14.054
Wade thinks my blowing the power
is some sort of mating call.

04:14.054 --> 04:15.188
Two, I need a ride.

04:15.188 --> 04:18.225
Fuse box-- yes, ride-- no.

04:18.225 --> 04:21.529
I have a prior commitment.
Lavon, no, a woman's
having a baby.

04:21.529 --> 04:24.131
So drive yourself.
Go on, take the hybrid.

04:24.131 --> 04:25.165
But you always give me rides.

04:25.165 --> 04:28.336
I can't just keep you company

04:28.336 --> 04:30.404
every time you need
to make a house call, now.

04:30.404 --> 04:31.805
This ain't Driving Miss Zoe.

04:31.805 --> 04:33.674
I have important

04:33.674 --> 04:35.309
mayoral business to conduct.

04:35.309 --> 04:38.579
Hey oh, big man,
you got the TV warmed up?

04:38.579 --> 04:40.881
Hey, Doc.
Want to join us

04:40.881 --> 04:44.352
for the Ladies' Beach
Volleyball Championships?

04:44.352 --> 04:46.720
Fine.
Take the Navigator.

04:46.720 --> 04:49.823
Just don't change
the radio stations.

04:51.592 --> 04:53.594
Do you even know how to drive?

04:53.594 --> 04:55.429
I've had my license
since I was 16.

04:55.429 --> 04:57.030
Have you driven since then?

04:57.030 --> 05:01.869
The principles haven't changed.
It's not a flying car.

05:08.942 --> 05:12.913
She knows she's supposed to call
me and tell me where she is.

05:12.913 --> 05:17.918
It just frazzles me to my
last stitch, it really does.

05:17.918 --> 05:20.554
Magnolia has Daddy wrapped
around her little finger,

05:20.554 --> 05:22.923
and just makes me the
bad guy all the time.

05:22.923 --> 05:25.258
No. You're her big sister,
she worships you.
Not anymore.

05:25.258 --> 05:29.196
All I do is yell at her now,
and we used to have such fun.

05:29.196 --> 05:34.167
You know, we used to play house,
and I'd be the mama...

05:34.167 --> 05:37.505
I'd dress her up in all
the clothes I outgrew.

05:37.505 --> 05:39.039
She was like my little
walk-around doll.

05:39.039 --> 05:42.543
Yeah, you might be getting some
payback for that right now.

05:42.543 --> 05:45.112
Okay, enough about me.

05:45.112 --> 05:46.279
How was your day?

05:46.279 --> 05:48.048
Well...
Oh!

05:48.048 --> 05:51.519
Did you hear that
Marvella Pinckney died?
Isn't that so exciting?

05:51.519 --> 05:53.821
Did you have today
in a pool, or something?

05:53.821 --> 05:58.459
No. I mean, of course,
I'm not happy that she died--

05:58.459 --> 06:01.662
poor thing, bless her heart--

06:01.662 --> 06:04.898
but it does mean that
her house is available,

06:04.898 --> 06:08.168
and I have wanted to live
in that house since
I was a tiny girl.

06:08.168 --> 06:11.639
And seeing as you and I
are looking for a house,

06:11.639 --> 06:14.408
now we can get it,
thanks to Marvella Pinckney.

06:14.408 --> 06:16.176
And her filterless cigarettes.

06:16.176 --> 06:18.278
Poor thing.

06:18.278 --> 06:20.047
Bless her heart.

06:20.047 --> 06:23.551
* *

06:26.219 --> 06:29.022
(phone ringing)

06:29.022 --> 06:30.558
RECORDING:
You've reached Dr. Breeland.

06:30.558 --> 06:32.392
Leave a message
and I'll get back to you.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.393
(beep)

06:33.393 --> 06:34.928
Good morning, Brick.

06:34.928 --> 06:38.298
I just wanted to leave a message
to say that Mrs. Colyer has

06:38.298 --> 06:40.200
a healthy baby boy.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.702
Took most of the night.

06:41.702 --> 06:43.837
And towards the end she said,

06:43.837 --> 06:46.840
"Thank you for not inducing
my labor before I was ready,

06:46.840 --> 06:48.609
just so you could watch a
football game."

06:48.609 --> 06:51.344
Okay, she didn't say that,
but she was thinking it.

06:51.344 --> 06:53.346
Have fun.

06:53.346 --> 06:55.348
NAVIGATION SYSTEM:
Prepare to turn right.

06:55.348 --> 06:57.317
Into a tree?

06:57.317 --> 06:58.552
Go away.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.589
(screams)
(loud bang)

07:08.496 --> 07:10.430
Hello?

07:10.430 --> 07:14.067
Hello? Anybody there?

07:14.067 --> 07:15.769
Are you hurt?

07:15.769 --> 07:18.238
If you're hurt, make a noise.

07:18.238 --> 07:21.208
I'm a doctor.
Dr. Zoe Hart.

07:21.208 --> 07:22.610
I'm from BlueBell.

07:22.610 --> 07:25.245
No, I'm not from BlueBell,
I'm from New York.

07:25.245 --> 07:28.582
I'm only in BlueBell... Oh, my
God, it's not important. Hello?

07:30.250 --> 07:32.786
Hello?

07:35.255 --> 07:39.159
* *

07:39.159 --> 07:41.094
Shelley! Oh, my God!

07:41.094 --> 07:42.095
You're up early.

07:42.095 --> 07:44.031
I've been up all night.
Doing what?

07:44.031 --> 07:46.800
Looking for a man.
Might want to try a little
extra makeup next time.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.669
Morning, Shelley.
Hey, Zoe.

07:48.669 --> 07:49.837
You're up early.

07:49.837 --> 07:51.639
George, I'm totally
freaking out.

07:51.639 --> 07:53.406
I ran over a man
with my car.

07:53.406 --> 07:55.676
Wait, what?
When'd you get a car?

07:55.676 --> 07:58.546
It's Lavon's car.
Oh, my God.

07:58.546 --> 08:00.681
How is that important?
Okay, you know what,

08:00.681 --> 08:01.949
just calm down.
When and where?

08:01.949 --> 08:05.418
A couple hours ago.
In Settler's Woods.

08:05.418 --> 08:07.420
Okay, Zoe, Zoe...
Huh?

08:07.420 --> 08:09.089
You probably just hit a deer.
Mm-hmm.

08:09.089 --> 08:11.158
Okay, there are a lot
of deer in those woods.
Yep.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.961
Are they the kind with
man heads? Because then
that would explain it.

08:13.961 --> 08:16.429
Okay, what'd he look like?

08:16.429 --> 08:18.431
I only saw him for a second.

08:18.431 --> 08:21.669
But his face is
burned into my brain.

08:21.669 --> 08:23.503
He kind of looked like-- like...

08:23.503 --> 08:26.506
He, he...
Like what?

08:28.976 --> 08:29.843
Him.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.316
It looked like him?

08:36.316 --> 08:37.585
It is him.
That's the guy.

08:37.585 --> 08:40.921
That-- that's Leon Mercy.

08:40.921 --> 08:41.955
Okay, and?

08:41.955 --> 08:44.858
And he's been dead
for over a year.

09:10.183 --> 09:13.053
Was, yes. Saved the whole
Rivenbark family,

09:13.053 --> 09:15.623
including an out-of-town
cousin from their burning
house one night.

09:15.623 --> 09:17.324
And then three months later,

09:17.324 --> 09:18.926
he was dead himself.

09:18.926 --> 09:21.695
Except that he's not,
because I saw him last night.

09:21.695 --> 09:24.197
Except he is, 'cause
I was at the funeral.

09:24.197 --> 09:27.200
His poor wife standing there
with their baby boy.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.936
What are you saying,
I ran down a ghost?

09:28.936 --> 09:30.804
No, you're saying you
ran down a ghost,

09:30.804 --> 09:35.375
and you need to stop saying
it if you want to get some
patients in this town.

09:35.375 --> 09:37.544
Morning.
Hey, hon.
Hey.

09:37.544 --> 09:39.379
Sheriff Bill,
did you find anyone?

09:39.379 --> 09:41.114
Wait, hold up.

09:41.114 --> 09:43.150
That's the call you got
that took you out the
house this morning

09:43.150 --> 09:45.418
before you even
had your pancakes?

09:45.418 --> 09:47.688
I searched Settler's Woods
where you said it happened.

09:47.688 --> 09:49.022
But didn't see a thing.

09:49.022 --> 09:50.958
Because you imagined the man.

09:50.958 --> 09:52.425
BILL:
Most likely it was a deer.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.961
Or a raccoon.
Black bear.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.863
Coyote.
Bobcat, maybe even a cougar.

09:55.863 --> 09:58.866
Good God, where do I live?
I don't think the mayor's
going to be happy

09:58.866 --> 10:00.634
about the damage you did
to his headlight.

10:00.634 --> 10:03.336
I don't think Leon Mercy's going
to be too wild about it either.

10:03.336 --> 10:04.805
It's not even 10:00 a.m.,

10:04.805 --> 10:06.573
I already got
two people mad at me.

10:06.573 --> 10:09.042
Two is a better start
than most days.

10:09.042 --> 10:10.543
Leon Mercy?

10:10.543 --> 10:14.715
You got me out of bed to hunt
around the woods for a dead guy?

10:14.715 --> 10:17.350
On pancake day?

10:17.350 --> 10:20.688
Goodness gracious.
I could have had breakfast.

10:20.688 --> 10:23.824
That's three.
You're catching up.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.025
(knock at door)

10:25.025 --> 10:26.994
Hey, Lavon.

10:26.994 --> 10:29.830
Hey, did I catch you
at a bad time?

10:29.830 --> 10:32.833
Uh, no, no.
Come on in.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.234
Great.
Go on, sit down.

10:34.234 --> 10:37.204
So, uh, what's been
going on?

10:37.204 --> 10:38.739
Not much.

10:38.739 --> 10:40.774
Did you hear
Marvella Pinckney died?

10:40.774 --> 10:43.076
Yeah I did, I did.

10:43.076 --> 10:44.678
Very sad.

10:44.678 --> 10:49.850
Well, it... It is.
But as it turns out,

10:49.850 --> 10:53.153
I have been asking
Babs Foster

10:53.153 --> 10:56.156
if she would help
Lemon and me find a house

10:56.156 --> 10:58.726
for after we're married.
Mm-hmm.

10:58.726 --> 11:00.293
It seems that Lemon has always

11:00.293 --> 11:02.963
had this dream of living
in the Pinckney house.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.431
Yeah.

11:04.431 --> 11:05.565
Oh.

11:05.565 --> 11:06.566
You knew?

11:06.566 --> 11:08.869
No.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.403
No, I was just listening.

11:10.403 --> 11:14.474
Okay, well, now Babs tells me
that the Pinckney house

11:14.474 --> 11:17.277
is registered as
a BlueBell historic property.

11:17.277 --> 11:20.748
The only way it can be sold
is with approval from the town.

11:20.748 --> 11:22.649
(laughs)

11:22.649 --> 11:24.885
Uh, it's not
that easy.

11:24.885 --> 11:27.788
You know, there are procedures

11:27.788 --> 11:29.790
and-and committees, a
whole process to it.

11:29.790 --> 11:32.525
But it's not
an act of Congress, right?

11:32.525 --> 11:34.594
It's BlueBell.
(chuckles)

11:34.594 --> 11:36.696
Yeah, it is.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.099
And I'm gonna say no.

11:40.133 --> 11:41.935
No?

11:41.935 --> 11:45.672
I get, like, 50 requests a day--
"do me this,

11:45.672 --> 11:47.140
do me that."

11:47.140 --> 11:49.009
Other people in this town
want things, too.

11:49.009 --> 11:52.880
I just thought
you might help me out.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.647
Move you to the front
of the line.

11:54.647 --> 11:57.350
I guess so.

11:57.350 --> 11:58.351
And why would I do that?

11:58.351 --> 11:59.619
(chuckles)

11:59.619 --> 12:00.888
As a favor?

12:00.888 --> 12:01.889
'Cause I'm asking?

12:01.889 --> 12:03.791
But you didn't ask.

12:03.791 --> 12:05.525
You just said
what you wanted.

12:05.525 --> 12:07.694
Okay, well, now I'm asking.

12:07.694 --> 12:09.396
And I remain disinclined.

12:11.198 --> 12:13.633
Look, I know you're used to
getting what you want, now...

12:13.633 --> 12:16.269
Okay, I don't know where
all this is coming from, Lavon,

12:16.269 --> 12:19.572
but you do know
that there are plenty other ways

12:19.572 --> 12:21.108
I can go about
doing this, right?

12:21.108 --> 12:22.810
I think you should get to them.

12:22.810 --> 12:24.511
I'll challenge
the statute in court.

12:24.511 --> 12:25.578
Oh, I love a challenge.

12:25.578 --> 12:26.679
Then I'll see you there.

12:26.679 --> 12:28.348
I'll circle it
on my calendar.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.589
ROSE:
 How did this happen?

12:36.589 --> 12:38.859
I thought I had his attention.

12:38.859 --> 12:41.829
Boys are impossible to decipher.

12:41.829 --> 12:43.964
(phone ringing)
So, can I borrow an outfit?

12:43.964 --> 12:46.699
What? Outfit?

12:46.699 --> 12:47.634
For the party.

12:47.634 --> 12:49.136
At the lake.

12:49.136 --> 12:50.737
I knew you weren't listening.

12:50.737 --> 12:51.738
No, I'm sorry.

12:51.738 --> 12:52.739
I was listening.

12:52.739 --> 12:53.740
I'm just a little tired.

12:53.740 --> 12:54.774
Got a little lost.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.109
There's a party at the lake,

12:56.109 --> 12:58.445
and Frederick Dean
is gonna be there...

12:58.445 --> 13:00.547
And even though he's always
talking to me now

13:00.547 --> 13:04.885
about comic books, he still
hasn't officially asked me out.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.753
Magnolia's still after him.

13:06.753 --> 13:07.921
You want to
know something?

13:07.921 --> 13:08.922
She is just toying with him,

13:08.922 --> 13:11.424
like a cat with a ball of yarn.

13:11.424 --> 13:13.927
Dr. Hart, patient
is asking for you.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.195
Are you serious?

13:15.195 --> 13:16.763
Uh-huh.

13:16.763 --> 13:18.932
Right.

13:18.932 --> 13:20.033
(clears throat)

13:20.033 --> 13:21.869
Rose, my closet is your closet.

13:21.869 --> 13:23.636
Good luck tonight,

13:23.636 --> 13:26.239
my friend.

13:27.908 --> 13:30.043
Hi. I'm Dr. Zoe Hart.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.511
Nice to meet you.

13:31.511 --> 13:32.779
Laurette Nevis.

13:32.779 --> 13:34.047
How do you do?
Fine.

13:34.047 --> 13:35.715
Did someone refer you to me?
No.

13:35.715 --> 13:39.219
I heard people talking about
what you saw in Settler's Woods.

13:39.219 --> 13:40.753
I see.

13:40.753 --> 13:42.355
So I came here to
tell you that there is

13:42.355 --> 13:44.925
a rational explanation
for what you saw.

13:44.925 --> 13:46.927
Yes. I knew there was.

13:46.927 --> 13:48.195
What is it?

13:48.195 --> 13:50.797
The restless ghost
of Leon Mercy

13:50.797 --> 13:53.333
is asking you
for help.

13:55.235 --> 13:56.403
Okay.

13:56.403 --> 13:57.971
Well, thank you for com...
Look.

13:57.971 --> 14:00.340
Most people are too
closed off to admit

14:00.340 --> 14:04.677
the presence of spirits, but
they are all around us here.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.480
The woods that
drew you into them

14:07.480 --> 14:10.117
are filled with
the wandering dead.

14:10.117 --> 14:11.684
They did not draw me in.

14:11.684 --> 14:12.552
No?

14:12.552 --> 14:14.721
It was Lavon's GPS.

14:14.721 --> 14:16.556
And how are
you sleeping?

14:16.556 --> 14:19.026
Good. Very well, actually.

14:20.360 --> 14:23.964
The spirit of Leon Mercy
came to you for help,

14:23.964 --> 14:26.299
Can I... just...
because you...

14:26.299 --> 14:29.736
also have something
restless in you.

14:29.736 --> 14:34.707
You, Zoe Hart,
are a receiver.

14:34.707 --> 14:37.644
No. Okay, I am not a receiver.

14:37.644 --> 14:38.811
I'm from New York.

14:38.811 --> 14:40.080
New Yorkers are not receivers.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.848
Most of them don't even
get satellite.

14:41.848 --> 14:43.316
Let him in,

14:43.316 --> 14:45.418
face him,

14:45.418 --> 14:50.157
or you both will remain
trapped between worlds.

14:55.562 --> 14:58.698
(insects chirring)

14:58.698 --> 15:00.900
(leaves rustling)

15:07.874 --> 15:10.610
(owl hooting)

15:12.212 --> 15:14.681
Who?

15:14.681 --> 15:18.018
An educated doctor
who isn't scared of ghosts.

15:18.018 --> 15:19.652
That's who.

15:19.652 --> 15:21.354
I'm really not.

15:23.156 --> 15:26.759
(rock music playing in distance)

15:26.759 --> 15:28.962
Wade?

15:31.198 --> 15:33.500
(rock music playing loudly)

15:40.140 --> 15:43.110
(hair dryer humming)

15:50.350 --> 15:53.653
(buzzing)

15:53.653 --> 15:57.124
WADE:
Damn it, Zoe!

16:00.927 --> 16:04.497
(door opens, closes)

16:04.497 --> 16:06.799
Hey.

16:06.799 --> 16:07.800
What the hell?

16:07.800 --> 16:09.369
I am so, so sorry.

16:09.369 --> 16:11.104
It must be the new bug zapper.

16:11.104 --> 16:13.106
I totally forgot.

16:13.106 --> 16:15.108
What are you even
doing up at this hour?

16:15.108 --> 16:16.443
I'm not sleepy.

16:16.443 --> 16:17.844
Yeah, well,
I don't care.

16:17.844 --> 16:18.845
Go to bed.

16:18.845 --> 16:21.114
No, wait, wait!

16:21.114 --> 16:24.017
Since we're both up,
you want to hang out?

16:25.085 --> 16:26.553
Have some tea or something?

16:28.288 --> 16:29.389
Oh.

16:29.389 --> 16:30.457
Yeah.

16:30.457 --> 16:32.792
Yeah, I'll...
I'll have some "tea."

16:32.792 --> 16:33.993
Oh, no! Whoa, no.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.095
No, no. Never mind.

16:35.095 --> 16:36.129
Bad idea.

16:36.129 --> 16:38.031
I'm sleepy. Exhausted.

16:38.031 --> 16:39.132
Go away.

16:39.132 --> 16:41.934
You are a certified
crazy person,

16:41.934 --> 16:43.470
you know that?

16:43.470 --> 16:45.338
Now, historically I've found
that hot, but in your case,

16:45.338 --> 16:46.539
I think I'm cured.

16:46.539 --> 16:49.142
Unbelievable!

16:49.142 --> 16:51.010
He's right.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.579
This is nuts.

16:52.579 --> 16:53.713
Ghosts?

16:57.150 --> 16:59.018
(screaming)

16:59.018 --> 17:00.820
Oh, my God.
What?! What is it?!

17:00.820 --> 17:02.122
What?!
Leon Mercy!

17:02.989 --> 17:04.257
Leon Mercy?
Yeah, look.

17:04.257 --> 17:06.593
Leon Mercy, huh?

17:07.594 --> 17:08.627
Oh, yeah.

17:08.627 --> 17:10.463
Yeah, there's, like,
ten Leon Mercys

17:10.463 --> 17:11.464
out here.

17:11.464 --> 17:14.767
Okay, no ghosts,
no Leon Mercy, nothing.

17:14.767 --> 17:16.769
Thank you.
Good night.

17:16.769 --> 17:18.137
Wait. I'm sorry.

17:18.137 --> 17:21.040
Maybe I am nuts.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.343
Whew. Will you just
stay till morning?

17:28.648 --> 17:30.049
All right.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.851
Wait.

17:31.851 --> 17:33.553
Not there.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.054
Couch. Geez.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.756
Huh.

17:36.756 --> 17:38.225
Good night.
Wait.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.504
Blanket?

17:59.879 --> 18:01.348
(owl hooting)

18:13.793 --> 18:15.828
Wade. Wade.

18:15.828 --> 18:16.829
Wade.
(grunts)

18:16.829 --> 18:18.765
(gasps)

18:18.765 --> 18:20.032
Huh?

18:20.032 --> 18:21.168
I couldn't sleep.

18:21.168 --> 18:22.502
Because there are no ghosts.

18:22.502 --> 18:23.636
I know that.

18:23.636 --> 18:25.438
I'm a woman of science,
for God's sake.

18:25.438 --> 18:28.441
So I did some research, and I
found Leon Mercy's obituary.

18:28.441 --> 18:29.542
Look.

18:29.542 --> 18:32.312
Leon drowned in the Gulf
while he was fishing.

18:32.312 --> 18:33.980
They found his boat and
they searched forever

18:33.980 --> 18:35.047
until they
declared him dead,

18:35.047 --> 18:37.784
but no body was ever found.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.018
Why?

18:39.018 --> 18:40.320
I'll tell you why.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.389
Because he never died.

18:42.389 --> 18:43.723
Maybe he bumped his head
and he's walking around,

18:43.723 --> 18:46.259
he doesn't know who
he is or where he is.

18:46.259 --> 18:47.560
I have to go find him.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.896
So you didn't
wake me up for sex?

18:49.896 --> 18:51.464
Jerk!

18:51.464 --> 18:54.201
No, the point is, I
didn't imagine anything.

18:54.201 --> 18:55.202
(knock on door)

18:55.202 --> 18:56.203
(gasps)

18:57.570 --> 18:59.105
Rose?

18:59.105 --> 19:02.442
Zoe, I'm sorry it's late, but
Magnolia's passed out drunk

19:02.442 --> 19:04.377
in the car and we
can't wake her up.

19:04.377 --> 19:05.445
Who drove you here?

19:05.445 --> 19:06.546
Jacob Coburn--
he's a junior

19:06.546 --> 19:07.714
and president of
the sobriety club.

19:07.714 --> 19:09.549
Wait, there were juniors
at this party?

19:09.549 --> 19:11.784
I would have left, but I can't
leave Frederick with Magnolia.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.420
The kissing games turned
into drinking games.

19:13.420 --> 19:15.054
What were you thinking?
Hey, what's going on?

19:15.054 --> 19:16.155
You need my help?

19:16.155 --> 19:17.757
What was I thinking?

19:17.757 --> 19:18.825
We'll talk later.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.393
Come on, let's get her
out of the car.

19:20.393 --> 19:22.695
Okay, all right, move over,
stick man, take this.

19:22.695 --> 19:24.264
What happened?

19:24.264 --> 19:25.798
She was drinking a lot,

19:25.798 --> 19:26.966
I guess, like, a lot.

19:26.966 --> 19:29.202
Fruit punch and vodka.

19:29.202 --> 19:30.937
(engine starts)

19:30.937 --> 19:31.971
Hey, where's he going?!

19:31.971 --> 19:33.540
Oh, come on!

19:35.808 --> 19:37.244
Airway is clear,

19:37.244 --> 19:38.545
but her breathing
is very shallow.

19:38.545 --> 19:40.480
Wade, go get your car;
we have to bring her to

19:40.480 --> 19:42.081
my office immediately.
Hey, give me the flashlight.

19:42.081 --> 19:42.949
Let's go!

19:44.951 --> 19:46.486
What do you think's wrong?

19:46.486 --> 19:47.820
Could be alcohol poisoning.

19:47.820 --> 19:48.888
FREDERICK:
Is that bad?

19:48.888 --> 19:49.989
Is poisoning bad?

19:49.989 --> 19:51.491
Yeah, it's bad.
She'll be okay, right?

19:51.491 --> 19:53.960
Rose, she could've
choked on her own vomit,

19:53.960 --> 19:55.362
gone into
cardiac arrest,

19:55.362 --> 19:56.396
she could've died.

19:56.396 --> 19:57.497
Now get your phone;

19:57.497 --> 19:58.898
I need to notify
her father.

19:58.898 --> 20:00.967
You said she wouldn't
tell anyone. You promised.

20:00.967 --> 20:02.369
Zoe, you can't call her dad.

20:02.369 --> 20:04.671
I told everyone
you were the cool doctor.

20:04.671 --> 20:05.972
Please.

20:05.972 --> 20:07.106
Rose, she's a minor.

20:07.106 --> 20:09.141
Brick is out of town.

20:09.141 --> 20:10.943
That's good, that's good.
You don't have to call.

20:10.943 --> 20:13.646
Believe it or not, there's
someone that Magnolia and I both

20:13.646 --> 20:17.116
would like to call
even less than Brick.

20:17.116 --> 20:18.851
(doorbells jingle)

20:23.823 --> 20:25.292
How is she?

20:25.292 --> 20:26.493
She's going to be fine.

20:26.493 --> 20:27.794
She's resting.

20:27.794 --> 20:31.498
She's responsive, so
you can take her home.

20:31.498 --> 20:34.367
Well... thank you.

20:34.367 --> 20:35.568
No problem.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.470
You know, teenagers--
they're hard.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.439
My mom had to raise me
on her own

20:39.439 --> 20:41.341
when I was that age,
and, oh, boy...

20:41.341 --> 20:43.209
I said... thank you.

20:43.209 --> 20:45.278
Your medical help
is appreciated,

20:45.278 --> 20:47.480
but your family counseling
is not.

21:02.395 --> 21:04.364
What are you doing?

21:04.364 --> 21:06.165
Look, thanks for
staying last night,

21:06.165 --> 21:09.769
but even if I was afraid,
it's morning, and I'm not.

21:09.769 --> 21:12.972
You know, I'm no Dr. Phil or
whatever, but in my experience,

21:12.972 --> 21:14.841
when I'm having trouble
sleeping, it...

21:14.841 --> 21:16.175
Wait, let me guess.

21:16.175 --> 21:18.144
It's because you have something
unresolved in your life

21:18.144 --> 21:19.446
that you're not dealing with.

21:19.446 --> 21:21.414
No, it's 'cause
I need to get laid.

21:21.414 --> 21:26.185
Well, thank you for the expert
psychological insight.

21:26.185 --> 21:27.854
No problem.
You may go.

21:27.854 --> 21:29.989
Your services are
no longer needed.

21:29.989 --> 21:34.327
My services haven't even
been used, Doc.

21:34.327 --> 21:36.529
Your loss.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.468
(screams)

21:41.468 --> 21:44.170
Mom?
Hello, dear.

21:44.170 --> 21:46.606
What?! What is
it this time?

21:47.907 --> 21:50.377
You see her, too, right?

21:56.082 --> 21:58.017
Mom, what
are you doing?

21:58.017 --> 21:59.852
I hope I'm not
interrupting something.

21:59.852 --> 22:02.088
What? No.
Oh, well, howdy, ma'am.

22:02.088 --> 22:03.490
I'm Wade.

22:03.490 --> 22:05.358
Must say I didn't expect
to meet Zoe's mother

22:05.358 --> 22:06.493
so soon into our relationship.

22:06.493 --> 22:07.594
Oh, my God. Gross.

22:07.594 --> 22:09.362
Shut up.
Go fix the fuse box.

22:09.362 --> 22:12.932
It's a roller coaster ride,
but I don't want it to stop.

22:12.932 --> 22:14.100
Hey, anyway,

22:14.100 --> 22:15.234
good to meet you. Bye.

22:15.234 --> 22:16.469
Oh!

22:16.469 --> 22:18.371
(laughing)

22:18.371 --> 22:20.373
He seems... nice.

22:20.373 --> 22:22.642
Very homegrown.

22:25.378 --> 22:26.746
I brought you a present.

22:26.746 --> 22:28.247
It's a sound machine.

22:28.247 --> 22:29.281
Very soothing.

22:29.281 --> 22:30.517
Your nurse, uh,

22:30.517 --> 22:32.519
Addy, said that you
weren't sleeping.

22:32.519 --> 22:34.053
Why would you
show up like this?

22:34.053 --> 22:35.187
What choice did I have?

22:35.187 --> 22:36.656
You won't return my calls.

22:36.656 --> 22:39.392
Because I don't want
to talk to you.

22:39.392 --> 22:42.495
I just took two planes,
sat in a bus station

22:42.495 --> 22:44.964
in a town I think was called
Hickory Butt,

22:44.964 --> 22:47.400
but that could have been
the driver's accent,

22:47.400 --> 22:49.669
then I got a ride to your place
with a trucker

22:49.669 --> 22:51.003
who knows an amazing amount

22:51.003 --> 22:53.673
about packing
and shipping crawfish,

22:53.673 --> 22:56.142
so you will talk to me.

22:56.142 --> 22:57.644
Actually, I won't.

22:57.644 --> 22:59.345
I have a patient
who needs my help.

22:59.345 --> 23:00.680
There's a man
running around out there

23:00.680 --> 23:01.881
who may be hurt and confused.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.216
Your own mother
is hurt and confused.

23:04.216 --> 23:05.284
Oh, stop it.

23:05.284 --> 23:06.953
This man has a wife
and a child

23:06.953 --> 23:08.921
who, unlike me,
still has a father,

23:08.921 --> 23:10.623
so I am going
to go help him.

23:10.623 --> 23:11.858
Look, I get it-- you're mad.

23:11.858 --> 23:13.860
You've been mad at me before,

23:13.860 --> 23:16.563
and I've always just hung in
until you came around.

23:16.563 --> 23:20.166
So... come around.

23:21.568 --> 23:23.770
What do you need, Mother?

23:25.505 --> 23:26.906
What do you need?

23:26.906 --> 23:28.708
Because that's
what it's always about.

23:28.708 --> 23:30.910
You need me to forgive you?

23:30.910 --> 23:32.645
Yes.

23:33.446 --> 23:35.582
Fine. I forgive you.

23:35.582 --> 23:37.183
But you don't really mean it.

23:37.183 --> 23:38.585
No, it's a lie.

23:38.585 --> 23:40.853
Because that's what we do
for each other-- lie.

23:40.853 --> 23:42.188
That's the lesson I learned

23:42.188 --> 23:45.191
from the one person
I'm supposed to trust.

23:45.191 --> 23:47.560
So you want me
to forgive you

23:47.560 --> 23:50.463
for the big lie
that has defined my life?

23:50.463 --> 23:52.364
Sure.

23:52.364 --> 23:55.034
I forgive you.

23:55.034 --> 23:57.069
Got to go.

24:00.673 --> 24:03.209
(program playing over TV)

24:11.484 --> 24:13.385
I take it that you're not

24:13.385 --> 24:14.987
feeling well enough
for church today.

24:25.632 --> 24:28.234
Do you have anything
to say for yourself?

24:28.234 --> 24:29.836
We're out of cereal.

24:31.370 --> 24:32.939
Give me that.

24:34.373 --> 24:36.909
You could have died
last night.

24:36.909 --> 24:38.778
You scared me half to death.

24:38.778 --> 24:41.480
You exposed our family business
to that Dr. Hart.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.983
What has gotten into you lately?

24:43.983 --> 24:45.852
Nothing.

24:45.852 --> 24:47.920
What do you think
that Daddy is going to say

24:47.920 --> 24:49.522
when he hears
about your latest escapade?

24:49.522 --> 24:52.525
He'll say,
"Lemon, take care of it."

24:54.961 --> 24:58.865
Well... okay.

24:58.865 --> 25:00.900
Then why?

25:00.900 --> 25:02.769
Why would you put me
through this?

25:02.769 --> 25:04.470
Because... so what?

25:04.470 --> 25:07.406
You're not going to be able
to tell me what to do anyway.

25:07.406 --> 25:09.075
What do you mean?

25:09.075 --> 25:11.544
When you get married
to George Tucker and move out,

25:11.544 --> 25:13.880
you're not even
going to live here.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.682
You won't even know

25:15.682 --> 25:18.718
what I do, so stop pretending
you care about me,

25:18.718 --> 25:20.587
because you don't!

25:30.362 --> 25:31.631
ZOE:
Lavon.

25:31.631 --> 25:33.700
I need to borrow your car.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.635
Oh, you mean my remaining car.

25:35.635 --> 25:37.103
See, because the
last one you used

25:37.103 --> 25:38.971
is still off
getting a new headlight.

25:38.971 --> 25:41.373
Yes.
I need to save a man's life.

25:41.373 --> 25:42.909
What man?

25:43.710 --> 25:45.111
Leon Mercy.

25:45.111 --> 25:46.813
(chuckles)

25:46.813 --> 25:48.781
Well, if you have the power

25:48.781 --> 25:51.217
to raise the dead,
I'm sure you can solve

25:51.217 --> 25:54.153
a mundane problem
like transportation.

25:56.255 --> 25:57.790
(door opens)

25:57.790 --> 26:00.059
That wasn't really a no.

26:00.059 --> 26:01.928
(door closes)

26:09.869 --> 26:11.403
GEORGE:
Hey, baby.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.205
You, uh... you
ready for church?

26:13.205 --> 26:16.442
Oh, and before you
hear it from Babs,

26:16.442 --> 26:20.680
there... there is a tiny hitch
in getting the Pinckney place,

26:20.680 --> 26:23.482
but I promise you,
I will get it for you.

26:23.482 --> 26:25.484
What?

26:25.484 --> 26:28.020
George, how can you
even think

26:28.020 --> 26:30.156
about buying
a house right now?

26:30.156 --> 26:32.625
That is the single most
ridiculous thing

26:32.625 --> 26:33.926
that I have
ever heard.

26:33.926 --> 26:36.195
I take it things have changed.

26:36.195 --> 26:38.097
Yes.

26:38.097 --> 26:39.732
Everything.

26:39.732 --> 26:41.868
I know why
Magnolia's being

26:41.868 --> 26:44.270
such a holy terror,
and it's because I'm leaving.

26:44.270 --> 26:46.372
All the wedding
planning

26:46.372 --> 26:49.075
and the house hunting,
and I never even gave a thought

26:49.075 --> 26:50.810
that to Magnolia, it must seem

26:50.810 --> 26:53.780
like I'm just abandoning her
like Mama did to us.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.782
And now she's just

26:55.782 --> 26:57.616
drinking and doing
God knows what else

26:57.616 --> 26:59.786
right under my nose,
and I never even saw it,

26:59.786 --> 27:01.253
and I'm just so horrible.

27:01.253 --> 27:02.521
No, no, come on.

27:02.521 --> 27:03.923
You are not.

27:03.923 --> 27:05.524
(sobbing)
You are not horrible.

27:05.524 --> 27:07.760
And she knows...

27:07.760 --> 27:10.129
look, she knows
you're not abandoning her.

27:10.129 --> 27:12.431
Okay, she's just a full-blown
teenager now,

27:12.431 --> 27:14.867
and that... that's not
a big sister job.

27:16.368 --> 27:17.837
Look, Brick's got to step up
to the plate here.

27:17.837 --> 27:19.038
You got to talk to him.

27:19.038 --> 27:20.907
No, George.

27:20.907 --> 27:25.311
Daddy wouldn't have
a single clue what to do.

27:25.311 --> 27:27.680
He depends on me to...

27:30.817 --> 27:33.419
...to not be a problem.

27:36.422 --> 27:37.890
ZOE:
Leon!

27:39.491 --> 27:41.393
Leon!

27:41.393 --> 27:42.962
It's Dr. Hart.

27:42.962 --> 27:44.964
Hello?

27:48.067 --> 27:49.936
(gasps)

27:54.006 --> 27:55.674
Leon!

27:58.945 --> 28:01.247
(screams, grunts)

28:01.247 --> 28:02.715
No.

28:03.750 --> 28:05.852
(gasps)

28:09.055 --> 28:10.823
(sighing):
Oh, my God.

28:10.823 --> 28:12.859
What are you doing here?

28:12.859 --> 28:16.362
Well, Lavon said
you stole his car,

28:16.362 --> 28:19.966
asked me to come out here
and find you,

28:19.966 --> 28:23.469
knowing full well you'd
get lost out here and die.

28:23.469 --> 28:24.470
Well, you both
can laugh later.

28:24.470 --> 28:25.704
Can you just...
Shh!

28:25.704 --> 28:27.339
Did you just shush me?
Don't shush me!

28:27.339 --> 28:28.340
Shh.

28:28.340 --> 28:30.476
(rustling)

28:40.920 --> 28:42.922
Leon, are you hurt?
You look hurt.

28:42.922 --> 28:44.490
WADE:
Still pretty
good for a guy

28:44.490 --> 28:45.792
who's been dead for a year.

28:45.792 --> 28:48.060
Your wound is bleeding.
It could be infected.

28:48.060 --> 28:49.428
We need to get you
to a hospital.

28:49.428 --> 28:51.297
No.
Yes.

28:51.297 --> 28:52.932
Zoe, traditionally,
in a yes-no situation,

28:52.932 --> 28:55.101
argument goes to the guy
with the hatchet.

28:55.101 --> 28:57.804
He made it all the way
to my place on that leg.

28:57.804 --> 28:59.305
He needs my help.

28:59.305 --> 29:00.739
He could be confused.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.208
There's people
looking for you.

29:02.208 --> 29:04.443
Do you know that you have
a wife and child?

29:06.512 --> 29:08.815
Why the hell
do you think I'm out here?

29:09.715 --> 29:11.317
(Zoe screams)

29:19.625 --> 29:22.128
(sighs)

29:23.863 --> 29:25.464
Hey, George.

29:25.464 --> 29:26.465
Hey, Brick.

29:26.465 --> 29:29.035
Sorry to hear
about the 'Bama loss.

29:29.035 --> 29:30.102
Oh, wasn't even close.

29:30.102 --> 29:32.204
You know Florida
whips our butts

29:32.204 --> 29:33.840
every time we
go down there?

29:33.840 --> 29:35.274
Is Lemon inside?

29:35.274 --> 29:36.708
Yeah, she's upstairs,
but if you don't mind,

29:36.708 --> 29:37.844
give me a minute.

29:37.844 --> 29:39.745
What?

29:39.745 --> 29:41.914
We, uh... well, we had

29:41.914 --> 29:43.282
an incident with Magnolia
last night.

29:43.282 --> 29:45.217
What?
She went
to a party,

29:45.217 --> 29:47.453
and she passed out
from alcohol poisoning.

29:47.453 --> 29:49.621
Good Lord.

29:49.621 --> 29:51.323
Magnolia?
Yeah.

29:51.323 --> 29:53.625
Well, where...
where is she now?
She's upstairs,

29:53.625 --> 29:55.061
but she is fine, Brick.

29:55.061 --> 29:56.695
Zoe fixed her up.

29:56.695 --> 30:00.032
Zoe Hart said it
was alcohol poisoning?

30:00.032 --> 30:02.168
And Lemon took
her word for it?

30:02.168 --> 30:04.703
What the hell kind of party
did Lemon let her go to?

30:04.703 --> 30:06.839
You know what? Just settle down
for a second, Brick.

30:06.839 --> 30:09.041
'Cause Zoe might have saved
Magnolia's life last night,

30:09.041 --> 30:11.077
and Lemon,
this is not her fault,

30:11.077 --> 30:12.912
because she is not
Magnolia's mom.

30:12.912 --> 30:15.915
And she might have stepped up
and parented her

30:15.915 --> 30:18.050
all these years
because someone had to do it,

30:18.050 --> 30:19.919
but in my
honest opinion,

30:19.919 --> 30:21.353
she shouldn't have
to do it at all,

30:21.353 --> 30:23.022
and she definitely shouldn't
have to do it alone.

30:23.022 --> 30:25.457
You know, I don't think
I appreciate you

30:25.457 --> 30:27.759
coming into my house
and lecturing me

30:27.759 --> 30:29.896
on things that aren't
your concern.

30:29.896 --> 30:31.397
Yeah, well, guess
what, Brick.

30:31.397 --> 30:35.134
They became my concern the
minute I got engaged to Lemon.

30:35.134 --> 30:38.737
And I am sorry, Brick,
that your wife left you,

30:38.737 --> 30:40.706
but that happened
12 years ago,

30:40.706 --> 30:42.074
and you are still
sitting here

30:42.074 --> 30:43.876
acting like she went
to the corner store

30:43.876 --> 30:45.878
and she's going to
be back any minute.

30:54.320 --> 30:55.587
(sighs)

30:55.587 --> 30:57.056
Well...

30:58.824 --> 31:00.359
You know,

31:00.359 --> 31:03.262
when Alice left,

31:03.262 --> 31:06.465
I was in this... kind of a daze.

31:07.666 --> 31:11.203
I mean, she had done most
of the real child raising,

31:11.203 --> 31:12.638
and then here I was--

31:12.638 --> 31:17.109
I was left with this
two-year-old all on my own.

31:18.277 --> 31:19.545
Lemon--

31:19.545 --> 31:20.779
she was such a help.

31:20.779 --> 31:23.215
She was just so good.

31:25.151 --> 31:28.054
I did. I did. I...

31:29.855 --> 31:31.390
I just let it be.

31:32.925 --> 31:35.227
Well, Brick,
those girls need their dad.

31:37.663 --> 31:39.531
Both of them.

31:41.867 --> 31:44.136
ZOE:
 So you did come
 to my place last night.

31:44.136 --> 31:47.373
Well, seems that you
don't have amnesia.

31:47.373 --> 31:49.708
So I take it you faked
your own death.

31:49.708 --> 31:51.010
What did you mean

31:51.010 --> 31:52.744
when you said you did it
for your wife and kid?

31:52.744 --> 31:53.980
(clears throat)

31:53.980 --> 31:55.814
All done.

31:55.814 --> 31:57.416
No, you're not.

31:57.416 --> 32:00.019
Well, I am if you're not
going to talk.

32:00.019 --> 32:02.021
You have to fix me.
You're a doctor.

32:02.021 --> 32:03.089
And you're dead.

32:03.089 --> 32:04.423
Who you going to tell?

32:06.825 --> 32:08.227
What'd they say
about me in town?

32:08.227 --> 32:09.628
That you're a hero.

32:09.628 --> 32:11.097
They also say I was a screwup?

32:11.097 --> 32:13.165
How?
Name it.

32:13.165 --> 32:15.667
Was a gambler. Was a drinker.

32:16.702 --> 32:17.970
Was a loser.

32:17.970 --> 32:19.638
I was unreliable.

32:19.638 --> 32:20.606
Wade remembers, huh?

32:20.606 --> 32:22.874
You could be a little wild,
I recall.

32:22.874 --> 32:24.743
I think the word
is dangerous.

32:24.743 --> 32:26.145
Yeah. Yeah.

32:26.145 --> 32:27.646
That, too, as I recall.

32:27.646 --> 32:28.580
LEON:
You know the night

32:28.580 --> 32:30.416
I saved those people
from burning up?

32:30.416 --> 32:33.119
I was headed home
from a poker game,

32:33.119 --> 32:36.188
so drunk I don't
remember doing it.

32:36.188 --> 32:39.191
For all I know, I went
into that house to rob it.

32:39.191 --> 32:42.028
I woke up, and
overnight, I had gone

32:42.028 --> 32:45.431
from town screwup to
local hero just like that.

32:46.732 --> 32:49.768
But I knew that I was
the exact same person

32:49.768 --> 32:52.038
I was before that fire,

32:52.038 --> 32:54.673
even if they chose
to ignore it.

32:54.673 --> 32:56.342
So he went out on top.

32:56.342 --> 32:58.477
What do you mean, out on top?
He peaked.

32:58.477 --> 33:00.812
Went as high as he was gonna go.

33:00.812 --> 33:02.481
He knew it.

33:02.481 --> 33:05.084
Why sit around and watch it
all go to hell?

33:05.084 --> 33:06.352
So you just walked away?

33:06.352 --> 33:09.988
My baby would look at me

33:09.988 --> 33:12.824
like I was
the greatest thing on Earth.

33:12.824 --> 33:15.127
But I knew those
same eyes were

33:15.127 --> 33:17.763
gonna see me coming
home drunk and crazy

33:17.763 --> 33:19.231
or maybe even worse.

33:19.231 --> 33:22.634
So I took my boat out
and I jumped overboard.

33:22.634 --> 33:27.373
And now and forever,
his daddy is a hero.

33:27.373 --> 33:29.541
He doesn't even know
he has a daddy.

33:29.541 --> 33:31.977
Believe me,
he is not better off.

33:31.977 --> 33:33.279
You don't have kids, do you?

33:33.279 --> 33:35.614
No.

33:35.614 --> 33:38.384
Then you cannot possibly imagine
the choices!

33:38.384 --> 33:41.253
Now, you might
not understand why
I did what I did,

33:41.253 --> 33:44.056
but I did what I thought was
right for my child.

33:52.698 --> 33:55.801
Okay, you want to talk?

33:55.801 --> 33:57.136
Talk.

34:03.242 --> 34:04.610
Did you really think

34:04.610 --> 34:06.712
lying was doing
the best thing for me?

34:06.712 --> 34:07.846
Sometimes it is.

34:07.846 --> 34:10.982
I told you your cat died
peacefully in his sleep.

34:10.982 --> 34:12.451
Did you want to hear

34:12.451 --> 34:14.786
the he fell from the windowsill
and dropped ten floors?

34:14.786 --> 34:15.920
Mr. Mittens?

34:15.920 --> 34:18.157
You make a judgment call.

34:18.157 --> 34:19.858
Is it always right?

34:19.858 --> 34:21.427
No. It's not science.

34:21.427 --> 34:23.195
And a father isn't a cat.

34:23.195 --> 34:25.630
I wanted to tell you the truth.

34:25.630 --> 34:29.801
When your father found out--
my ex-husband, I mean--

34:29.801 --> 34:31.870
the one who raised you...
I know who you mean.

34:31.870 --> 34:35.141
I planned to tell you, and then
you would look up at me,

34:35.141 --> 34:38.476
those little eyes
so trusting.

34:38.476 --> 34:40.078
You didn't think
I could handle it?

34:40.078 --> 34:41.980
I didn't think I could.

34:41.980 --> 34:45.217
You were the most important
thing in the world to me, honey.

34:45.217 --> 34:47.485
You were all I had.

34:47.485 --> 34:51.422
If I could go back and undo it
all, I would.

34:51.422 --> 34:55.161
It's too late for that.

34:55.161 --> 34:58.197
But not for us.

34:58.197 --> 35:00.299
You need your mother,
sweetheart.

35:01.099 --> 35:04.570
You can't lie anymore.

35:04.570 --> 35:06.405
I won't.

35:11.643 --> 35:14.180
Even if it hurts,
I'm tough. I can take it.

35:14.180 --> 35:16.582
I'll always land
on my feet.

35:22.188 --> 35:24.790
So did Mr. Mittens.

35:24.790 --> 35:27.559
Fat lot of good it did him.

35:36.502 --> 35:38.770
You are not leaving
this house tonight.

35:38.770 --> 35:40.706
I want to see my friends.

35:40.706 --> 35:42.774
Am I not supposed
to have any friends?

35:42.774 --> 35:46.712
No, not if they're the same
friends that got you

35:46.712 --> 35:48.547
poison-drunk less than
24 hours ago!

35:48.547 --> 35:50.081
BRICK:
And that is something

35:50.081 --> 35:52.551
we have yet to discuss,
you and I.

35:52.551 --> 35:55.020
But we're gonna have plenty
of time to talk about it

35:55.020 --> 35:58.557
because, Magnolia Breeland,

35:58.557 --> 36:01.860
you are grounded for one month.

36:01.860 --> 36:02.861
(chuckles)

36:02.861 --> 36:03.995
Are you kidding?

36:03.995 --> 36:06.164
You can't ground me.
Forget it.

36:06.164 --> 36:07.699
You leave this
house tonight,

36:07.699 --> 36:10.536
or any night in the next month,
and I will have Sheriff Bill

36:10.536 --> 36:12.170
bring you home in
his patrol car,

36:12.170 --> 36:14.440
running the siren,
flashing the lights

36:14.440 --> 36:18.644
and saying your name on the
speaker horn the whole way.

36:22.248 --> 36:26.385
Oh, my God,
you are ruining my life!

36:27.553 --> 36:31.189
Oh, my Lord, you did that to me
when I was 15.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.324
And I only had

36:32.324 --> 36:33.792
to do it once.

36:33.792 --> 36:35.261
(both chuckle)

36:35.261 --> 36:36.795
Oh, sweetheart...

36:36.795 --> 36:38.330
thank you.

36:38.330 --> 36:41.733
You have done more
than your share around here,

36:41.733 --> 36:44.002
and I'm gonna do
more, too.

36:44.002 --> 36:47.273
More of what I should've been
doing all along.

36:50.208 --> 36:54.680
Well, then I will be happy

36:54.680 --> 36:59.485
to have someone else ruin
her life for a while.

37:11.497 --> 37:16.034
Well, I hope I don't have
to relocate my trailer.

37:16.034 --> 37:18.970
If I get carolers this year,
I'll know who to blame.

37:18.970 --> 37:20.339
How's the leg?

37:20.339 --> 37:22.908
Better.

37:22.908 --> 37:24.710
It's good.

37:27.479 --> 37:29.247
You could have
disappeared anywhere,

37:29.247 --> 37:30.482
but you stayed in BlueBell.

37:30.482 --> 37:32.618
It's where I grew up.

37:32.618 --> 37:35.354
It's where your son's
growing up.

37:35.354 --> 37:39.825
My dad, Harley,
he kept tabs on me, too.

37:39.825 --> 37:42.661
He showed up
at my graduation,
he stood

37:42.661 --> 37:44.463
right in front of me,
he talked to me.

37:44.463 --> 37:45.931
And he never told me
he was my father.

37:45.931 --> 37:49.167
Yeah, well, I told you why
I can't do that.

37:49.167 --> 37:51.470
Yeah.

37:54.340 --> 37:57.042
I brought you some
antibiotics.

37:57.042 --> 37:59.845
I was gonna tell you that you
can't take them with alcohol,

37:59.845 --> 38:02.414
but then I noticed that
you don't have any alcohol.

38:02.414 --> 38:06.418
I take it you're
not gambling either.

38:06.418 --> 38:07.386
You've changed, Leon.

38:07.386 --> 38:08.954
People can change.

38:08.954 --> 38:13.925
Apparently, they can be
forgiven, too.

38:15.694 --> 38:16.962
Go back,

38:16.962 --> 38:19.164
look them in the eye
and tell them the truth.

38:19.164 --> 38:21.700
Be a dad.

38:23.769 --> 38:25.971
* *

38:30.442 --> 38:32.043
Thank you.

38:40.251 --> 38:41.453
About the other day...

38:41.453 --> 38:43.989
Just to let you know, I...
No, go ahead.

38:43.989 --> 38:48.360
Lemon and I,
we're not gonna be needing

38:48.360 --> 38:52.197
the Pinckney house just yet,
so, no suing.

38:52.197 --> 38:53.365
(chuckles)

38:53.365 --> 38:55.934
Is everything on track
for the wedding?

38:55.934 --> 38:57.002
Oh, yeah, yeah.

38:57.002 --> 38:59.137
Oh, good. That's good.
(chuckles)

38:59.137 --> 39:01.272
So, anyway, when the,
uh, when the time comes,

39:01.272 --> 39:04.576
I'll just go through the proper
channels, and, uh...

39:04.576 --> 39:06.612
And I'm sorry

39:06.612 --> 39:08.246
about putting you in
that position.

39:08.246 --> 39:10.849
Oh, no, no, I was... uh...

39:10.849 --> 39:13.752
over-emphatic
in protection of the past.

39:13.752 --> 39:16.121
It's a really important house,
so...

39:16.121 --> 39:18.123
Yeah.

39:18.123 --> 39:20.325
But the past is the past, right?

39:20.325 --> 39:22.327
Ain't no reason for it

39:22.327 --> 39:24.496
to sit there empty
full of ghosts.

39:24.496 --> 39:27.499
Good point.

39:29.234 --> 39:30.335
To the future?

39:30.335 --> 39:32.337
The future.

39:32.337 --> 39:34.440
Yeah.

39:39.711 --> 39:41.112
Hey.

39:41.112 --> 39:42.948
Shot of bourbon, please.

39:42.948 --> 39:44.015
You sure, Doc?

39:44.015 --> 39:46.952
I could mix you up a
apple-tini or something.

39:46.952 --> 39:50.121
I've spent the past several
hours with my mom.

39:50.121 --> 39:51.423
A shot of bourbon now.

39:51.423 --> 39:53.058
Yeah.

39:53.058 --> 39:56.662
Why is Leon's picture off
the wall of dead people?

39:56.662 --> 40:01.232
Oh, well, he's
not dead anymore.

40:01.232 --> 40:02.568
That's right.

40:02.568 --> 40:05.504
Came, uh... walking back into
town just today.

40:05.504 --> 40:07.906
Nearly scared the pee
out of his wife.

40:07.906 --> 40:09.074
I can imagine.

40:09.074 --> 40:12.711
I guess he, uh... told her
some crazy story

40:12.711 --> 40:15.146
about, uh...
faking his own death.

40:15.146 --> 40:17.248
I don't know.

40:17.248 --> 40:19.818
They seem to be talking, though.

40:19.818 --> 40:22.888
From what I hear, he hasn't put
that boy of his down yet.

40:26.124 --> 40:27.125
Oh, big girl.

40:27.125 --> 40:28.660
(chuckles)

40:28.660 --> 40:30.562
(clears throat)

40:30.562 --> 40:32.363
Well, thanks for the drink.

40:32.363 --> 40:33.899
And for helping me

40:33.899 --> 40:35.534
with Leon.

40:35.534 --> 40:36.902
And staying over.

40:36.902 --> 40:38.670
And rescuing me.

40:38.670 --> 40:40.438
It's no wonder I'm so tired.

40:40.438 --> 40:42.140
No wonder.

40:42.941 --> 40:44.209
(slap)

40:44.209 --> 40:45.443
(clears throat)

40:45.443 --> 40:47.713
Did you just smack my butt?

40:47.713 --> 40:51.416
No. No, must've
been a ghost.

40:51.416 --> 40:54.119
* *

41:01.593 --> 41:05.463
(water burbling sounds)

41:14.405 --> 41:17.843
Great. Now I have to pee.

41:17.843 --> 41:19.511
(sighs)
