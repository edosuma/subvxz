00:37.144 --> 00:38.435
God, I hate coming to the vet.

00:38.569 --> 00:41.028
They charge me 90 bucks a day to keep Brian here.

00:41.311 --> 00:43.452
For 60 bucks I can put him over to Holiday-In.

00:43.701 --> 00:44.895
Nah. Who's with me?

00:47.650 --> 00:51.416
My apologies. My pet Cricket
has Restless-Legs-Syndrom.

00:52.247 --> 00:55.564
Ah. I hope Brians stomach
pains aren't anything serious.

00:56.021 --> 00:58.801
Eh, look at that, Lois.
That's why cats freak me out.

00:58.931 --> 01:01.981
He's doing that weird, stretchy leg thing.
When they lick themselves.

01:05.535 --> 01:06.560
Look at that, huh?

01:06.894 --> 01:08.319
Look at that ****.

01:08.169 --> 01:09.284
Ehhhhyo.

01:09.535 --> 01:12.349
Oh, thank god the vets are here to help Brian.

01:12.460 --> 01:14.585
I wanna be a veterinarian when I grow up.

01:14.586 --> 01:15.929
Meg. We've been over this.

01:15.955 --> 01:19.569
You're gonna gain a 150 pounds and
write ugly bety fan fiction.

01:19.627 --> 01:20.417
But dad.

01:20.445 --> 01:21.529
Meg. That's final.

01:21.608 --> 01:22.345
<i>Meg. That's final.</i>

01:22.530 --> 01:23.332
<i>Meg. That's final.</i>

01:23.333 --> 01:25.496
See? This bird knows what I'm talking about.

01:25.793 --> 01:26.461
Thank you.

01:26.462 --> 01:27.026
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:27.169 --> 01:27.740
Thank you.

01:27.764 --> 01:28.357
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:28.258 --> 01:29.281
You're very polite.

01:29.368 --> 01:30.032
<i>You're very polite.</i>

01:30.033 --> 01:33.220
You do not see that these days.
You do not see that.

01:33.228 --> 01:33.949
I like you.

01:33.950 --> 01:34.582
<i>I like you.</i>

01:34.583 --> 01:35.783
Oh, thank god.

01:36.128 --> 01:38.027
You know you never really know
what someboy thinks of you.

01:38.228 --> 01:39.909
But I'm glad I made a good first impression.

01:40.110 --> 01:41.762
Would you like to be friends?

01:41.828 --> 01:42.763
<i>Like to be friends.</i>

01:42.764 --> 01:44.969
Oh god, this is all going so smoothly.

01:44.970 --> 01:46.377
What's your name?
I'm Peter.

01:46.378 --> 01:46.849
<i>Peter.</i>

01:46.952 --> 01:48.548
No way!
That's my name!

01:48.549 --> 01:50.508
Hey you should come home and
spend the night at my house.

01:50.509 --> 01:52.121
Lois, will you make up the guestroom?

01:52.122 --> 01:54.907
Peter, that's someones pet.
You can't just take it.

01:54.908 --> 01:57.090
Well, maybe they never know it's gone.

02:03.808 --> 02:06.389
Oh, Brian. I'm so glad you're ok.

02:06.390 --> 02:07.532
Yes, he's doing fine.

02:07.533 --> 02:09.644
We were able to clear the stomach obstruction.

02:09.733 --> 02:11.649
Turns out, it was a used diper.

02:11.650 --> 02:15.226
- Iyehaa! Gross!
- Ohoho, yeeees.

02:15.227 --> 02:17.231
Get off my back. I thought it was indian food.

02:17.232 --> 02:19.980
Oh, thank you so much for your help, Dr. Jewish.

02:19.981 --> 02:22.087
I really thought that we're gonna lose him.

02:22.088 --> 02:23.640
It was my pleasure, Mrs. Griffin.

02:23.741 --> 02:25.897
Go ahead and check out with my intern Anna.

02:37.935 --> 02:44.624
<i>I never wanted anyone like this It's all brand new</i>

02:44.625 --> 02:48.087
<i>You'll feel it in my kiss</i>

02:48.589 --> 02:50.725
<i>I'm crazy for you.</i>

02:50.726 --> 02:54.137
<i>Bah Bah Bah Bah</i>

02:54.519 --> 02:58.366
<i>Ah-ah.</i>

02:58.877 --> 03:00.370
<i>Crazy for you.</i>

03:03.728 --> 03:06.101
We now return to "busy business lady",

03:06.102 --> 03:07.429
whose life is missing something,

03:07.461 --> 03:10.242
but she doesn't realize it,
because she's so busy with business.

03:10.643 --> 03:12.416
No, no, I cannot make this business meeting.

03:12.417 --> 03:14.288
I've got a different business meeting at 3:00,

03:14.289 --> 03:15.289
and we will doing business there.

03:15.949 --> 03:17.617
I was wondering if you're free for coffee.

03:17.618 --> 03:18.618
Oh, no, I can't!

03:18.719 --> 03:21.247
I've got a lunch meeting and
then a meeting after lunch.

03:21.269 --> 03:21.623
After that...

03:23.005 --> 03:24.320
Over the next 90 minutes...

03:24.452 --> 03:28.105
I'd like to show you that all your
problems can be solved by my penis.

03:36.389 --> 03:37.115
Hey guys.

03:37.130 --> 03:38.838
What is going on?

03:38.954 --> 03:40.289
- No way!
- Coool!

03:40.290 --> 03:41.390
That thing don't bite, do it?

03:41.792 --> 03:44.220
Guys, say hello to Adrien Beaky.

03:44.342 --> 03:45.454
<i>Pick a lane, bitch.</i>

03:45.455 --> 03:48.554
Ehehe. Ain't that funny?
He heard me say that on the way over in the cab.

03:48.589 --> 03:50.513
<i>I gotta pee, where's that snapple bottle?</i>

03:51.718 --> 03:53.552
<i>I had a gay experiance at camp.</i>

03:54.529 --> 03:57.876
W-Wait, we had the radio on and we
were talking about some goofy stuff.

03:57.877 --> 03:59.187
So, what, what are you guys drinking?

03:59.322 --> 04:02.471
Hey Peter, you kind of look like a pirat
with that thing on your shoulder.

04:02.671 --> 04:04.327
A Pirat?
Ah, cool.

04:04.350 --> 04:05.845
You should get a pirat name.

04:05.880 --> 04:06.737
And a peg-leg.

04:06.738 --> 04:07.738
And a hook-hand.

04:07.939 --> 04:09.510
And you should have sex with that crossing guard,

04:09.511 --> 04:11.827
even though she looked young
and then i found out she was 12.

04:12.889 --> 04:14.166
I mean, you should get an eye patch.

04:15.629 --> 04:16.704
Eye patch would be cool.

04:21.202 --> 04:24.751
Mom, can we go back to the vet and
see the pretty vet assistant again?

04:24.811 --> 04:27.304
Well, I guess if Brian get sick again.

04:27.386 --> 04:29.818
Oh, boy!
Hey Brian, look!

04:30.571 --> 04:32.746
Brian's sick.
Mom, get your keys!

04:32.789 --> 04:34.344
Chris, I'm not going to the vet.

04:35.113 --> 04:37.159
Haha. There's me wench.

04:37.160 --> 04:39.009
Peter, what the hell are you doing?

04:38.977 --> 04:41.702
That's Long John Peter to you, Porthole.

04:43.950 --> 04:47.562
Fetch me five tankards of ale
and a leg of mutton for me maties!

04:50.153 --> 04:51.512
Who the hell are those guys?

04:51.546 --> 04:54.342
Just a few sea dogs from my fishin' boat days.

04:54.342 --> 04:55.987
I don't care who they are.
They stink.

04:56.027 --> 04:56.769
Get 'em out of here!

04:56.789 --> 04:58.594
They stink of good cheer, Lois.

05:01.866 --> 05:03.830
After we've had our fill of bread and wine,

05:03.865 --> 05:05.487
we shall tell tales of other times we had

05:05.518 --> 05:07.301
our fill of bread and wine.

05:07.585 --> 05:11.862
God, this is a more disturbing sight
then Tom Hanks and E.T. in Philadelphia.

05:12.274 --> 05:14.657
Ouch...

05:14.892 --> 05:15.686
Here you go, you're good.

05:15.687 --> 05:17.053
You didn't touch me.

05:17.054 --> 05:18.508
I don't wanna to get AIDS.

05:24.010 --> 05:25.874
Ahhhh, Kristallnacht!

05:25.975 --> 05:30.579
Ahaaa. 'Tis Long John Peter and
his merry men come seeking plunder.

05:30.580 --> 05:33.346
All your Tuck's Medicated Pads be ours.

05:33.347 --> 05:35.202
Ahh! Oh my God!

05:35.503 --> 05:37.757
Oh, Dod, why are you doing this!?

05:37.792 --> 05:39.461
Ahaaa.
For no reason.

05:39.462 --> 05:43.991
I'm going to fire this canon all over your store.
Hahahahaha.

05:46.659 --> 05:49.400
Ahaaa. Terrible pharmacy toys.

05:49.554 --> 05:52.077
We'll see to it that no child ever received these

05:52.178 --> 05:55.094
as a last minute gift hastily
bought on the way to the party.

06:00.544 --> 06:02.734
Dear me, it's almost 3 o' clock.

06:02.735 --> 06:04.634
I've got to get this shipment of sugarcane,

06:04.635 --> 06:07.502
tobacco and spices to the harbor before day's end.

06:09.358 --> 06:11.885
That car is coming up awfully fast.

06:12.164 --> 06:14.476
But at least it's flying the British Flag.

06:20.127 --> 06:21.935
Oh, no. Privateers.

06:21.936 --> 06:24.757
No doubt. They're after my
sugarcane, tobacco and spices.

06:24.958 --> 06:28.811
Well, Shelley Booth bishop isn't
about to let you over-egg this pudding.

06:42.289 --> 06:43.645
Prepare to be boarded.

06:43.829 --> 06:45.506
You'll never take my cargo.

07:00.902 --> 07:01.841
Load the cannon.

08:00.300 --> 08:01.402
All clear, sir.

08:04.125 --> 08:05.338
Shootitagain.

08:05.374 --> 08:06.990
What? I didn't understand that.

08:06.991 --> 08:09.394
I said, shoot it again.
But I said it pirate like.

08:25.366 --> 08:28.545
Well done, you barnacle-munchings-callywiggers.

08:28.546 --> 08:30.222
Sir, we've got a man down.

08:30.223 --> 08:31.897
Oh my God! Adrien Beaky.

08:31.898 --> 08:32.898
Say something.

08:33.134 --> 08:36.052
<i>Shoot ...me ...</i>

08:36.053 --> 08:38.033
Oh god, this is my fault.

08:38.234 --> 08:39.278
I did this!

08:39.578 --> 08:41.461
I've screwed up worse than Disney did

08:41.462 --> 08:44.299
when they cast Michael J.
Fox in that Zorro remake.

08:44.769 --> 08:47.254
Who was that masked man who saved us?

08:47.255 --> 08:48.050
I dont' know.

08:48.051 --> 08:49.622
But he left his insignia.

08:56.532 --> 08:58.058
Give it to me straight, Dr. Jewish.

08:58.259 --> 08:59.239
Is he gonna live?

08:59.340 --> 09:01.670
Mr. Griffin, I'm afraid your parrot is dead.

09:01.871 --> 09:04.824
Noooooooooo!

09:05.671 --> 09:07.658
Did he at least die with dignity?

09:07.759 --> 09:10.699
Well, he convulsed a lot and
fell of the operating table.

09:10.700 --> 09:12.906
Then he flopped around a little on the floor.

09:12.907 --> 09:15.202
Then a passing nurse accidentally stepped on him

09:15.203 --> 09:16.883
and kicked him into a puddle of urin,

09:17.084 --> 09:20.569
which must have frightened him, because
his bowels released all over himself.

09:20.570 --> 09:21.749
I tried to pick him up,

09:21.750 --> 09:24.546
but then I got angry because
some of it got on my thump.

09:24.547 --> 09:27.218
So I threw him against the
wall and that's where he died.

09:27.419 --> 09:29.120
That's the way I want to go.

09:29.694 --> 09:31.523
I'm really sorry about your dad's parrot.

09:31.524 --> 09:32.594
Oh, that's okay.

09:32.595 --> 09:35.869
He'll get over it pretty quickly and
then move on to another wacky thing.

09:35.870 --> 09:37.672
Lois, whose pipe organ is this?

09:37.773 --> 09:38.794
My name's Anna.

09:38.795 --> 09:40.438
Um.. I'm Chris.

09:41.693 --> 09:44.070
Sometimes I have to poop for a long time.

09:45.162 --> 09:46.471
Now you say something.

09:47.710 --> 09:48.669
You're funny.

09:48.670 --> 09:50.951
But I bet a lot of girls tell you that, huh?

09:50.952 --> 09:53.138
Well, the only girl I know is my sister

09:53.139 --> 09:54.239
and she sucks!

09:54.701 --> 09:56.737
Aha, sorry to hear that.

09:56.738 --> 09:59.187
Wow, we're having a conversation.

10:00.822 --> 10:02.765
Listen, I have to get back to work

10:02.849 --> 10:06.516
but, um, would you maybe
wanna go out sometime?

10:06.517 --> 10:07.554
Yeeesss!!!

10:07.555 --> 10:09.082
Great, here's my number.

10:09.083 --> 10:10.285
Awesome!

10:11.093 --> 10:13.330
Oh no, I broke the pipe organ.

10:13.331 --> 10:15.418
Hey, look, the deed to a cattle ranch.

10:23.986 --> 10:27.999
So, um... how do you like working at the vet?

10:28.000 --> 10:30.012
Oh, it is so rewarding.

10:30.313 --> 10:33.940
Ever since I was a little girl,
I have loved working with animals.

10:34.341 --> 10:36.594
Did you ever make it with one of the dogs?

10:36.595 --> 10:37.239
What!?

10:37.239 --> 10:40.093
I mean, I, I, did you enjoy your appetizer?

10:40.094 --> 10:41.307
It hasn't come yet.

10:41.308 --> 10:45.505
Oh, uhm, I mean, did you ever
make it with one of the dogs?

10:45.799 --> 10:47.445
No! Stupid!

10:47.446 --> 10:49.338
Chris, just relax.

10:49.339 --> 10:50.555
Um, okay.

10:52.763 --> 10:53.954
You know, Anna...

10:53.955 --> 10:57.876
...when I first saw you, I thought you
were the most beautiful girl in the world.

10:57.877 --> 11:00.881
And now all I wanna do is
show you my innermost self

11:00.881 --> 11:02.631
but I'm afraid you'll reject me,

11:02.631 --> 11:04.501
because you won't like what you see.

11:04.652 --> 11:07.580
Or that you'll see my scrotum,
and see that it has a seam on it,

11:07.581 --> 11:10.472
and then you'll think I'm made up of two
different guys that were sewn together,

11:10.473 --> 11:12.357
'cause that's what I think happened, and...

11:12.458 --> 11:14.408
Chris. I like you.

11:18.535 --> 11:19.908
You don't have to try so hard.

11:20.209 --> 11:20.909
I'm sorry.

11:21.010 --> 11:25.732
When I'm around a pretty girl, I'll get all
worked up, like a kid watching a toy commercial.

11:25.933 --> 11:27.289
<i>Kids, kids, kids!</i>

11:27.290 --> 11:27.848
<i>Shiny!</i>

11:27.848 --> 11:28.311
<i>Gooey!</i>

11:28.311 --> 11:28.979
<i>Stretchy!</i>

11:28.979 --> 11:29.571
<i>Fun!</i>

11:29.567 --> 11:31.479
<i>Hasbro's Best Thing Ever!</i>

11:31.480 --> 11:31.893
<i>Sticky!</i>

11:31.893 --> 11:32.299
<i>Yummy!</i>

11:32.299 --> 11:32.947
<i>Bouncy!</i>

11:32.947 --> 11:33.488
<i>Fun!</i>

11:33.489 --> 11:34.982
<i>Hasbro's Best Thing Ever!</i>

11:35.264 --> 11:35.868
<i>Fly it!</i>

11:35.903 --> 11:36.701
Yeah!

11:36.701 --> 11:37.265
<i>Toss it!</i>

11:37.466 --> 11:38.266
Awesome!

11:38.467 --> 11:39.082
<i>Swim it!</i>

11:39.082 --> 11:39.987
Aww!

11:40.087 --> 11:40.555
<i>Eat it!</i>

11:40.820 --> 11:41.699
Whoa!

11:41.700 --> 11:43.220
<i>Hasbro's Best Thing Ever!</i>

11:43.521 --> 11:47.172
Kids?! Kids?!
It's so awesome!

11:47.173 --> 11:48.331
I want it!

11:53.037 --> 11:56.347
Hey fellas, uhm, I have a question.

11:56.348 --> 12:00.171
I went on a date with this girl, that I really like,

12:00.171 --> 12:04.456
and, if you don't mind, I was hoping
I could ask you a few questions,

12:04.656 --> 12:06.215
about the birds and the bees?

12:06.216 --> 12:08.687
Aha, my boy wants to know about sex.

12:08.688 --> 12:09.588
Came to the right place.

12:09.589 --> 12:13.600
Chris, would you always wanna remeber,
is that sex is perfectly natural.

12:13.601 --> 12:18.261
Whoa, uh, uh,sorry, Mr. Swanson.
Um, I wasn't really talking to you.

12:18.262 --> 12:20.415
Chris, I know a lot about sex.

12:20.416 --> 12:22.955
Yeah, and I'm sure you have fond memories,

12:22.956 --> 12:27.570
but I was kind of hoping to get some advice
from someone who isn't broken from the waist down.

12:27.670 --> 12:28.656
I'm a father!

12:28.657 --> 12:30.447
You're two wheeled Monster!

12:33.721 --> 12:34.987
That's going to be my ring tone.

12:34.988 --> 12:35.907
Quagmire, call me.

12:46.281 --> 12:47.824
Well, I have to get to work, Chris.

12:47.825 --> 12:50.045
I have tons and tons of dogs to incinerate,

12:50.046 --> 12:51.847
but I can't wait to see you tomorrow night.

12:52.700 --> 12:53.933
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

12:54.033 --> 12:54.958
I'll clean that up.

12:54.959 --> 12:57.924
Oh, uh, that's okay, I'll
get it, have fun at work.

12:58.025 --> 12:59.859
K, bye Chris.

13:01.179 --> 13:02.655
What do you think you are doing?

13:02.656 --> 13:03.380
What!?

13:03.367 --> 13:06.754
You, a man, are cleaning up a mess made by Anna,

13:06.755 --> 13:11.144
a woman, that she, also a
woman, spilled on you, a man.

13:11.145 --> 13:11.872
So..!?

13:11.873 --> 13:13.845
You treating here like a human beeing.

13:13.846 --> 13:17.308
If you want to get anywhere with a
chick, you can't treat 'em too nice-like.

13:17.309 --> 13:18.093
Really!?

13:18.094 --> 13:18.984
Trust me, Chris.

13:18.985 --> 13:21.483
The next time you see this
girl, treat her like crap.

13:21.684 --> 13:25.768
And you'll be cooler than a mid
-'80s novelty answering machine message.

13:25.769 --> 13:28.312
<i>I'm gald you called, but im not home,</i>

13:28.313 --> 13:30.091
<i>but I'll be back before too long,</i>

13:30.092 --> 13:31.011
<i>You gotta wait for the beep,</i>

13:31.011 --> 13:31.895
<i>you gotta leave your name,</i>

13:31.895 --> 13:32.896
<i>you gotta leave your number,</i>

13:32.997 --> 13:34.704
<i>wait for the beep!</i>

13:35.405 --> 13:36.228
It's me again.

13:36.323 --> 13:38.061
I just had to hear it one more time.

13:41.046 --> 13:42.779
Chris, is everything okay?

13:42.780 --> 13:45.679
You seem a little, I don't know, quite tonight.

13:45.680 --> 13:47.324
Yeah, everything's fine.

13:47.525 --> 13:49.339
Ah yes, can I have two tickets,

13:49.340 --> 13:52.403
one man and one bitch that needs to do what I say.

13:52.504 --> 13:53.114
What!?

13:53.115 --> 13:54.224
That's not funny, Chris.

13:54.225 --> 13:55.225
Here is your ticket.

13:55.226 --> 13:56.226
Pick that up!

13:56.227 --> 13:58.260
Chris, why are you acting like this?

13:58.261 --> 14:01.028
Pick that up and cook it into something delicious

14:01.063 --> 14:03.164
or knit it into something that's useful to me!

14:07.897 --> 14:10.505
Uhm. Are you ready to make out now?

14:10.506 --> 14:13.940
Why in the world I wanan do
that after what you just said?

14:13.941 --> 14:16.091
You obviously not the person I thought you were.

14:16.092 --> 14:17.708
I never wanna see you again!

14:17.709 --> 14:19.854
I can't believe I thought you were special¿

14:20.469 --> 14:21.484
Anna, wait!

14:21.685 --> 14:24.400
Oh no, what did I do!?

14:24.535 --> 14:27.103
Hey Chris, guess what we just did?
Bonny, tell him.

14:27.103 --> 14:28.871
- We had sex.
- We had sex!

14:28.872 --> 14:30.465
We had what Joe calls sex.

14:35.971 --> 14:37.571
Chris, honey, what's wrong?

14:37.572 --> 14:39.666
Anna took a dump on me.

14:39.667 --> 14:40.483
What!?

14:40.484 --> 14:42.496
Yeah. She broke up with me.

14:42.497 --> 14:46.216
Oh-ho, she dumped you, that's what you meant to say.

14:46.217 --> 14:47.217
What's the difference?

14:47.218 --> 14:49.799
What you said first was, what...

14:49.800 --> 14:53.621
well, I mean, what when two
grown-ups love each other very much.

14:53.622 --> 14:57.043
Sometimes they show it by, uhah, never mind.

14:57.078 --> 14:58.583
So, so what happened?

14:58.584 --> 14:59.484
I don't know.

14:59.485 --> 15:01.595
I did everything Dad said.

15:01.605 --> 15:04.354
Uch, I should've known that Peter
had something to do with this.

15:04.354 --> 15:06.941
You're not the first person whose life he screwed up.

15:11.427 --> 15:12.336
Knock, knock.

15:12.384 --> 15:15.056
Nicole, Ronald, who's ready for Boggle?

15:16.012 --> 15:21.387
Oh my god! No! Why!? Why!?
My beautiful Nicole.

15:21.388 --> 15:23.881
My man Ranold, who did this!?

15:23.882 --> 15:26.396
Oh man, there were so good together.

15:26.397 --> 15:29.020
We were just establishing our friendship.

15:29.021 --> 15:31.190
THey were about to get engaged.

15:31.225 --> 15:33.519
Oh, he was going to ask me to be un usher.

15:33.720 --> 15:36.836
I mean, he already had enough
grooms man, so he made me an usher.

15:36.982 --> 15:41.219
But just to think I could be
involved in the ceremony in any way!

15:41.391 --> 15:44.116
You told Chris to act like a jerk to this girl?!

15:44.355 --> 15:46.472
Well... define Chris.

15:46.572 --> 15:48.676
Peter, he's really upset right now.

15:48.677 --> 15:51.289
I mean, he cared about this girl a lot.

15:51.290 --> 15:52.576
Can't you see what you've done?

15:52.577 --> 15:54.907
I don't know, I mean, I-I thought I was helping.

15:54.908 --> 15:56.191
But you may be right,

15:56.392 --> 16:00.068
'cause now Chris is all sad and
crying and fat and bad at sports.

16:00.069 --> 16:03.123
Well, you created this mess
and you have to help him fix it.

16:03.158 --> 16:07.521
Man, parenting is more complicated
then making a 1940s phone call.

16:08.064 --> 16:10.852
Hello, operator?
Crestview 4162, please.

16:10.853 --> 16:12.295
<i>One moment please.</i>

16:29.355 --> 16:33.357
- Hello?
- Hello!

16:34.317 --> 16:36.078
Well, what dou you know about that!?

16:44.799 --> 16:46.339
Hey Chris, it's me.

16:46.340 --> 16:48.211
I got something for you here.

16:48.250 --> 16:48.982
What is it?

16:48.983 --> 16:50.939
I caught you a bullfrog outside.

16:50.940 --> 16:53.652
Poked some holes in its bag so it can breathe.

16:53.653 --> 16:54.819
See, look at this-

16:54.825 --> 16:55.952
Oh, boy.

16:56.537 --> 16:57.755
All right, hang on, hang on.

17:39.811 --> 17:41.970
I'm never gonna be happy again.

17:41.971 --> 17:43.390
I know how you feel, son

17:43.391 --> 17:44.606
but u can't give up now.

17:44.607 --> 17:46.919
Now let's get out there and meet some ladies, eh?

17:47.020 --> 17:48.930
But I don't want to date anyone else.

17:49.131 --> 17:50.262
I want Anna.

17:50.263 --> 17:53.562
Chris, you don't want to miss out
on experiencing your teenage years.

17:53.584 --> 17:56.731
If you do, you'll feel as bad
as I do when I miss the toilet.

18:00.350 --> 18:01.997
<b>Peter Griffin!!</b>

18:08.129 --> 18:09.515
All right Chris, have a seat here.

18:09.516 --> 18:10.683
Your date'll be here any minute.

18:10.684 --> 18:13.962
I fact, I think she'll be
coming through that door.

18:15.249 --> 18:17.002
<i>Hey Chris, i'm Betty.</i>

18:17.003 --> 18:18.003
<i>Sorry I'm late.</i>

18:18.204 --> 18:20.077
<i>Your Dad told me all about you.</i>

18:20.078 --> 18:22.026
<i>You sound like a swell fella.</i>

18:22.027 --> 18:23.983
Uh... Thanks.

18:24.384 --> 18:25.735
So where are you from?

18:25.736 --> 18:29.058
<i>I'm from the rich part of town,
so you know I'm a good egg.</i>

18:29.059 --> 18:30.719
<i>But I'm more intersted in you.</i>

18:30.720 --> 18:33.429
<i>- Did you finish your homework today?
- What!?</i>

18:33.529 --> 18:35.815
<i>You know your dad's got a birthday coming up.</i>

18:35.836 --> 18:38.579
<i>Have you giving any thoughts to
what you might be getting him?</i>

18:38.614 --> 18:40.982
How do you know when my dad's birthday is?

18:40.983 --> 18:42.894
<i>Well, eh, eh, it doesn't matter.</i>

18:42.895 --> 18:44.949
<i>What are you getting your Dad for his birthday?</i>

18:44.950 --> 18:46.793
I dont' know - a tie.

18:46.794 --> 18:50.003
<i>Ohh, I don't know if he would want one of those.</i>

18:50.004 --> 18:51.945
<i>I think he's got enough ties.</i>

18:51.946 --> 18:54.687
- I think he might...
- Chris, I don't want a tie pick something else.

18:56.510 --> 19:00.499
Chris, this is Barbara, the girl from
your class you used to have a crush on.

19:00.500 --> 19:03.570
Now, you kids enjoy yourselves
and I'll create some atmosphere.

19:03.571 --> 19:06.016
This is a favourite by "Men At Work".

19:16.317 --> 19:18.309
Look at me with a brand-new Hyundai.

19:22.248 --> 19:26.381
I dont' understand Chris, your Blind Date
should be here by now, she answered the ad.

19:27.283 --> 19:28.620
Wohow...

19:33.931 --> 19:36.546
So, still no luck on the girl front, huh?

19:36.547 --> 19:38.210
I know Dad's been trying to help

19:38.211 --> 19:41.807
and I'm trying to listen to him
but nothing seems to be working.

19:41.808 --> 19:47.150
Well, I know, I asked him to help but it occurs
to me that you've been taking advice from everyone

19:47.151 --> 19:49.278
except the one person who matters.

19:49.279 --> 19:50.788
What are you want, Chris?

19:51.002 --> 19:53.539
All I want is to go out with Anna again.

19:53.540 --> 19:58.187
Then you just need to go talk to her
and tell her exactly how you feel.

19:58.188 --> 20:00.924
But she's sad, she never wants to see me again.

20:00.925 --> 20:04.324
Well, I'm sure you can come up with
some excuse to see her at the vet.

20:04.425 --> 20:05.325
Is there anymore coffee?

20:09.362 --> 20:12.110
Anna, I'm here with my dog.

20:12.111 --> 20:13.982
He's not feeling well.

20:13.983 --> 20:15.513
f*c* you!

20:15.698 --> 20:17.480
Don't you think you rather go to another vet?

20:17.637 --> 20:19.255
Anna, to be honest.

20:19.293 --> 20:23.384
I came here 'cause I wanted to
apologize for acting like such a jerk.

20:23.385 --> 20:25.083
That's not who I am.

20:25.084 --> 20:27.572
Oh yeah, no, no, no yet, no,
you're, you're, you're a cool guy.

20:27.573 --> 20:28.832
Brian, shut up!

20:29.823 --> 20:31.759
Look, look, I was just really nervous

20:31.760 --> 20:33.899
'cause I've never had a girlfriend before and

20:33.919 --> 20:36.580
I wanted to make sure I didn't do anything wrong.

20:36.581 --> 20:39.675
You know, you really hurt me, Chris.

20:39.676 --> 20:41.612
I know, I was wrong.

20:41.613 --> 20:43.506
I don't want to hurt anybody, Anna.

20:44.267 --> 20:46.690
Please, just give me another chance.

20:46.691 --> 20:49.263
Gosh! He doesn't look so good.

20:49.264 --> 20:51.857
I know, but you do.

20:55.957 --> 20:58.386
You know, I get off at 4:00.

20:58.387 --> 21:00.836
I might just be up for a movie.

21:04.439 --> 21:06.467
Ok, somebody really needs to help me here.
