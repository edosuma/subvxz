WEBVTT

00:07.208 --> 00:10.081
OH, MY GOD. COME QUICK!
IT'S YOUR SISTER ANNABELLE!
NO WAY.

00:10.081 --> 00:14.515
I want to come home.
TAKING ANNABELLE--THAT WAS
NEVER PART OF THE DEAL.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.517
YOU ASKED ME TO GIVE YOU DATA,

00:16.517 --> 00:18.619
TO TELL YOU WHEN WE WERE RUNNING
THE EXPERIMENT. THAT'S ALL.

00:18.619 --> 00:21.492
THE DEAL IS WHATEVER WE SAY IT
IS. ANNABELLE IS JUST INSURANCE.

00:21.492 --> 00:23.794
WHAT'S THAT ON HIS HAND?
(Janis) THAT LOOKS LIKE A RING.

00:23.794 --> 00:26.527
(Simon)
A QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT DEVICE.

00:26.527 --> 00:29.029
I'M GABRIEL McDOW.
I TOLD YOU THAT.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.532
I SAID--I DEFINITELY
SAID THAT ALREADY.

00:31.532 --> 00:34.135
(Gabriel) YOU HAVE
TO REMEMBER THINGS, OLIVIA.
GABRIEL, WHY HAVE YOU
BEEN FOLLOWING ME?

00:34.135 --> 00:36.267
YOU'RE GOING THE WRONG WAY.
THE FUTURES I SAW,

00:36.267 --> 00:38.109
YOU'RE ALWAYS WITH LLOYD.

00:38.109 --> 00:40.511
YOU ALL KNOW FIONA BANKS,
MI6.

00:40.511 --> 00:43.174
(Fiona) NONE OF THEM
HAD VISIONS,

00:43.174 --> 00:46.777
AND NOW THEY'RE ALL DEAD.
(Al) "THE BLUE HAND.
NO LIMITS. NO FEAR."

00:46.777 --> 00:49.520
(Wedeck) A DEATH CLUB?
(Demetri) SLINGERLAND.
AM I SAYING THAT RIGHT?

00:49.520 --> 00:52.183
IT SAYS HERE
YOU TAUGHT AMERICAN HISTORY

00:52.183 --> 00:55.055
AT SOUTH FAIRFAX HIGH.
THE SCRIPT FOR THIS CONVERSATION
HAS ALREADY BEEN WRITTEN.

00:55.055 --> 00:58.459
(Jeff) WHATEVER YOU'VE ALL SEEN
IS GONNA HAPPEN.
(man) Now Celia's death
was an accident, okay?

00:58.459 --> 01:01.092
It could've happened
to anyone.
AL!

01:01.092 --> 01:03.234
WHAT I SAW DOESN'T HAVE TO
PLAY OUT THAT WAY.

01:03.234 --> 01:05.166
I FOUND A WAY
TO CHANGE THE GAME.
AL!

01:15.106 --> 01:18.149
(telephone rings in distance)

01:18.149 --> 01:20.451
YOU DO REALIZE YOU'RE WEARING
THE SAME JACKET

01:20.451 --> 01:23.484
YOU WERE WEARING WHEN WE BROKE
GROUND ON THE ACCELERATOR.

01:23.484 --> 01:26.257
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT,
I SUPPOSE.
(chuckles)

01:26.257 --> 01:28.719
THERE ARE NO ACCIDENTS, LLOYD.

01:28.719 --> 01:32.123
I DETECT
SOME SUBLIMATED SENTIMENT

01:32.123 --> 01:34.265
BUBBLING TO THE SURFACE.

01:34.265 --> 01:36.827
THIS IS A BIG DEAL
FOR BOTH OF US.

01:36.827 --> 01:41.472
(sighs) WE'VE BEEN WORKING
ON TACHYONS FOR 12 YEARS.

01:41.472 --> 01:44.175
THIS IS OUR MOMENT, SIMON.

01:44.175 --> 01:46.137
GO WITH IT.
CHEERS.

01:46.137 --> 01:47.638
(clink)
CHEERS.

01:49.680 --> 01:52.143
GOD, I HOPE IT ALL WORKS.

01:52.143 --> 01:55.546
WE'RE SIMULATING THE BIG BANG.
WHAT COULD GO WRONG?

01:55.546 --> 01:57.218
(chuckles)

01:57.218 --> 01:59.220
(cell phone rings)
EXCUSE ME.

01:59.220 --> 02:01.152
SURE.
IT'S MUM.

02:01.152 --> 02:02.453
(ring)

02:02.453 --> 02:04.155
HELLO.

02:08.159 --> 02:09.900
WHAT?

02:09.900 --> 02:11.432
WHEN?

02:15.206 --> 02:17.368
(sighs) OKAY.

02:17.368 --> 02:20.171
UH...

02:20.171 --> 02:21.642
IS ANNABELLE ALL RIGHT?

02:21.642 --> 02:23.544
JUST, UH,

02:23.544 --> 02:26.577
JUST TELL HER I'LL BE
ON THE FIRST FLIGHT HOME.

02:26.577 --> 02:28.519
YEAH.

02:28.519 --> 02:31.382
OKAY, YOU, TOO. BYE.

02:33.384 --> 02:35.556
UH...

02:35.556 --> 02:37.528
MY DAD DIED.

02:39.830 --> 02:43.163
(woman over P.A.)
ACTIVATION IN ONE MINUTE.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.165
(man speaks indistinctly)
(woman) ALL RIGHT.

02:45.165 --> 02:48.269
THIS EXPERIENCE WAS DESIGNED
BY DR. CAMPOS,

02:48.269 --> 02:51.171
WHO, UNFORTUNATELY, COULD NOT
BE WITH US ON THIS DAY

02:51.171 --> 02:54.174
WHEN WE RECREATE
THE BEGINNING OF THE UNIVERSE.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.907
LLOYD SIMCOE,
DR. CAMPOS' MENTOR,

02:56.907 --> 02:58.909
THE BRAIN BEHIND THE BRAIN--

02:58.909 --> 03:01.181
THIS IS ANGIE TREMONT
FROM THE "NEW SCIENCE REPORT."

03:01.181 --> 03:04.184
A JOURNALIST?
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
SHE'S BEEN CLEARED.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.686
OH, SORRY.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.688
WE HAVE A RATHER STRICT
CONFIDENTIALITY PROTOCOL,

03:07.688 --> 03:10.190
SO WE'RE A LITTLE WARY
OF THE PRESS.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.192
IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU,
DR. SIMCOE.
YES.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.894
DR. MYHILL'S BEEN TELLING ME
ALL ABOUT THE PROJECT.

03:13.894 --> 03:15.896
YOUR CROWNING GLORY.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.898
WELL, IT'S BEEN A TEAM EFFORT.
UH, GORDON,

03:17.898 --> 03:20.331
THE PRELIMINARY FIRINGS
HAVE STARTED.

03:20.331 --> 03:22.873
THE BIG MOMENT.
(telephone rings)

03:22.873 --> 03:24.875
(indistinct conversations)

03:24.875 --> 03:26.477
(ring)

03:26.477 --> 03:27.978
YES?

03:29.480 --> 03:30.811
THEY'RE READY.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.513
(hangs up receiver)

03:34.245 --> 03:36.247
ACTIVATION COMMENCING
IN 30 SECONDS.

03:36.247 --> 03:37.888
INITIATE. HERE GOES NOTHING.

03:37.888 --> 03:39.890
(accelerators power up)

03:39.890 --> 03:42.353
OR EVERYTHING.

03:43.954 --> 03:46.357
ACTIVATION COMMENCING

03:46.357 --> 03:49.500
IN 20 SECONDS.

03:49.500 --> 03:53.904
(whirring)

03:53.904 --> 03:55.706
ACTIVATION COMMENCING

03:55.706 --> 03:57.668
IN 10 SECONDS...

03:57.668 --> 03:59.770
9, 8,

03:59.770 --> 04:01.742
7, 6,

04:01.742 --> 04:03.914
5, 4,

04:03.914 --> 04:05.816
3, 2,

04:05.816 --> 04:06.977
1.

04:06.977 --> 04:08.879
(explosion)

04:13.754 --> 04:16.787
(Olivia) HEY, HONEY.
(Charlie) GO AHEAD.
IT'S YOUR HOME, TOO.

04:16.787 --> 04:19.360
(Aaron)
I'LL ALWAYS FIND YOU, KIDDO.

04:19.360 --> 04:29.400
(people talking at same time)

04:29.400 --> 04:35.446
(people talking at same time)

04:35.446 --> 04:39.680
â™ªâ™ª

04:45.316 --> 04:48.319
(accelerators powering down)

05:12.913 --> 05:16.016
(people shouting and screaming
in distance)

05:26.897 --> 05:28.899
(Lloyd) THE VISIONS PEOPLE HAD

05:28.899 --> 05:30.901
ARE REALLY
ONLY JUST POSSIBLE FUTURES.

05:30.901 --> 05:33.103
UH, THE UNIVERSE OPERATES
WITHIN CERTAIN PARAMETERS,

05:33.103 --> 05:35.366
BUT THERE IS SOME FLEXIBILITY.

05:35.366 --> 05:37.668
WITH ONE WEEK TILL THE 29th,
DR. SIMCOE,

05:37.668 --> 05:40.371
WE ARE ALL STILL WONDERING
WHAT TO EXPECT.

05:40.371 --> 05:42.413
WELL, IT'S A WELL-KNOWN PRECEPT
IN QUANTUM PHYSICS

05:42.413 --> 05:45.376
THAT OBSERVATIONS
SHAPE REALITY.

05:45.376 --> 05:47.948
YOU'RE SAYING
THAT SEEING OUR FUTURES

05:47.948 --> 05:50.050
MAY, IN FACT,
CHANGE OUR FUTURES.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.052
UH, THAT'S THE THEORY, YES.

05:52.052 --> 05:55.025
BUT THE FUTURE DOES
HAVE A WAY OF FIGHTING BACK.

05:55.025 --> 05:57.027
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

05:57.027 --> 06:00.491
SMALL THINGS MAY CHANGE,
BUT THE FORCES OF THE UNIVERSE

06:00.491 --> 06:03.894
MAY BE PUSHING US TOWARDS
THE FUTURES WE HAVE SEEN.
THAT'S INTERESTING.

06:03.894 --> 06:06.397
AND WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE
WHO LEARNED FROM MOSAIC

06:06.397 --> 06:08.439
THEY WERE MEANT TO DIE
BEFORE THE 29th

06:08.439 --> 06:10.871
BUT LIVED PAST
THE FATAL EVENT?

06:10.871 --> 06:12.873
WELL, THOSE PEOPLE ARE
THE STATISTICAL ANOMALIES

06:12.873 --> 06:15.876
AT THE EDGE OF THE CURVE.
SHOULD YOU STILL BE WORRIED?

06:15.876 --> 06:18.479
BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'RE SAYING

06:18.479 --> 06:20.611
THE UNIVERSE
MAY COURSE-CORRECT,

06:20.611 --> 06:23.153
THAT THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE
ESCAPED THEIR FATES AFTER ALL.

06:23.153 --> 06:24.855
YES, THAT'S POSSIBLE.

06:24.855 --> 06:27.017
SO MAYBE A BETTER WORD
FOR "COURSE-CORRECTION"

06:27.017 --> 06:28.058
IS "DESTINY"?

06:28.058 --> 06:30.060
WELL, I'M JUST A SCIENTIST,

06:30.060 --> 06:32.893
I'M NOT REALLY QUALIFIED
TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.895
I'D LIKE TO WELCOME
TONIGHT'S NEXT GUEST--

06:34.895 --> 06:36.997
CELIA QUINONES.

06:36.997 --> 06:39.430
MS. QUINONES IS THE YOUNG WOMAN
WHOSE FUTURE WAS CHANGED

06:39.430 --> 06:41.732
BY THE SUICIDE
OF FBI AGENT ALL GOUGH--

06:41.732 --> 06:44.975
ONE OF DR. SIMCOE'S
"STATISTICAL ANOMALIES."

06:44.975 --> 06:47.678
MS. QUINONES,
TAKE US THROUGH YOUR EXPERIENCE.

06:47.678 --> 06:50.040
FIRST, I-I WOULD LIKE
TO SAY AGAIN

06:50.040 --> 06:52.042
TO THE FAMILY
OF AGENT GOUGH

06:52.042 --> 06:54.985
HOW... GRATEFUL
MY FAMILY AND I ARE

06:54.985 --> 06:56.947
FOR HIS ACTIONS.

06:56.947 --> 07:00.190
UM, IN THE FIRST WEEKS
AFTER THE BLACKOUT,

07:00.190 --> 07:02.192
I HEARD
THAT NOT HAVING A VISION

07:02.192 --> 07:04.925
MEANT THAT I WOULD BE DEAD
ON APRIL 29th.

07:04.925 --> 07:07.057
THAT MUST'VE BEEN TERRIFYING
FOR YOU.

07:07.057 --> 07:08.999
WHEN I DISCOVERED
ON THE MOSAIC WEB SITE

07:08.999 --> 07:12.202
THAT I WOULD BE HIT BY A CAR,
I LIVED IN CONSTANT TERROR

07:12.202 --> 07:14.905
THAT I MIGHT DIE
AT ANY MOMENT.
BUT YOU DIDN'T.

07:14.905 --> 07:16.907
I'M SURE A LOT OF PEOPLE
HAVE QUESTIONS,

07:16.907 --> 07:19.510
SO LET'S OPEN UP
THE PHONE LINES.

07:19.510 --> 07:21.512
UH, MUNCIE, INDIANA,
YOU'RE ON THE AIR.

07:21.512 --> 07:23.474
(man) This question's
for Dr. Simcoe.

07:23.474 --> 07:25.476
Is it possible
the blackout caused

07:25.476 --> 07:27.478
permanent brain damage
to anyone?

07:27.478 --> 07:29.520
THERE'S NO REASON
TO BELIEVE SO.

07:29.520 --> 07:31.522
Well, people's lives
have been ruined.

07:31.522 --> 07:33.654
What if this happens again?

07:33.654 --> 07:35.956
IT IS CRITICAL
THAT PEOPLE REMAIN CALM.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.828
A-AND--AND I-I MUST REPEAT

07:37.828 --> 07:39.890
THAT NO ONE'S BRAIN
WAS DAMAGED IN ANY WAY

07:39.890 --> 07:41.892
BY THE BLACKOUT ITSELF.

07:41.892 --> 07:43.894
AND LET ME REASSURE YOU

07:43.894 --> 07:46.837
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THERE
COULD BE ANOTHER BLACKOUT.

07:46.837 --> 07:48.939
I ALMOST BELIEVE HIM MYSELF.
YEAH, TELL ME AGAIN

07:48.939 --> 07:52.072
WHY WE'RE NOT TELLING PEOPLE
THERE'S ANOTHER BLACKOUT COMING?

07:52.072 --> 07:54.575
BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHEN
IT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

07:54.575 --> 07:56.777
WE TELL PEOPLE
BUT DON'T SAY WHEN?

07:56.777 --> 07:59.049
THE WORLD WILL
TURN INTO AN ARMED CAMP.

07:59.049 --> 08:02.753
SO, CELIA, YOU'RE CONFIDENT
THAT YOUR FUTURE HAS CHANGED?

08:02.753 --> 08:05.516
I'M STILL HERE. (chuckles)

08:05.516 --> 08:08.759
THE UNIVERSE SEEMS TO HAVE
A DIFFERENT PLAN FOR ME.

08:08.759 --> 08:11.662
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US
TODAY.

08:11.662 --> 08:14.064
ANY LAST WORDS,
DR. SIMCOE?

08:14.064 --> 08:15.966
UH, COME THE 29th,

08:15.966 --> 08:19.670
I BELIEVE
THAT WE WILL ALL END UP

08:19.670 --> 08:21.932
WHERE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE.

08:21.932 --> 08:24.504
"SUPPOSED TO BE"?
(woman) THANK YOU
FOR SPEAKING WITH US TODAY.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.937
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
WE CAN'T DECIDE OUR FATE.

08:26.937 --> 08:29.509
AFTER THE BREAK,
WE'LL BE TALKING TO...

08:29.509 --> 08:31.982
AUTHOR OF THE AWARD-WINNING
BOOK "TEENS AND TRUTH."

08:31.982 --> 08:34.244
SHE'S GOING TO HELP US
FIGURE HOW TO TALK ABOUT...

08:34.244 --> 08:35.646
STOP! STOP!

08:35.646 --> 08:36.947
THAT'S MY SISTER!

08:36.947 --> 08:38.248
(tires screech)

08:38.248 --> 08:41.291
(horns honking)

08:41.291 --> 08:44.124
ANNABELLE! ANNABELLE!
STOP THERE!

08:44.124 --> 08:47.798
ANNABELLE!
STOP, SIMON! DON'T COME
ANY CLOSER OR THEY'LL KILL ME!

08:47.798 --> 08:50.731
WHO? WHAT?
THEY'RE WATCHING.
THEY'LL SHOOT ME.

08:50.731 --> 08:54.264
WHAT? WHO? WHAT DO THEY WANT?
THEY SAID THEY WANT
YOU AND THE RING.

08:54.264 --> 08:56.607
THEY GOT YOUR MESSAGE,
AND THEY'RE SENDING ONE BACK.

08:56.607 --> 08:59.570
YOU HAVE 12 HOURS,
OR THEY'LL KILL ME.

08:59.570 --> 09:00.741
ANNABELLE.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.072
PLEASE, SIMON.

09:02.072 --> 09:05.676
GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANT.
THEY WERE VERY SPECIFIC.

09:05.676 --> 09:07.678
YOU ONLY HAVE 12 HOURS
TO GIVE THEM THE RING

09:07.678 --> 09:11.321
OR THEY WILL KILL ME.
GET IN THE CAR. JUST GO.

09:11.321 --> 09:13.984
ANNABELLE,
I'M NOT LEAVING YOU HERE.
GET IN THE CAR.

09:13.984 --> 09:16.156
ANNABELLE...
JUST GO! PLEASE, JUST GO!

09:29.870 --> 09:32.042
LET'S GO. NOW.

10:00.370 --> 10:02.733
ZAMPIERON?

10:02.733 --> 10:06.036
TECH WIZARD EXTRAORDINAIRE?

10:06.036 --> 10:08.038
I'LL TAKE THAT AS A "YES."

10:12.743 --> 10:14.014
LICENSE PLATE?

10:14.014 --> 10:15.686
YOU ARE GOOD.

10:15.686 --> 10:18.048
WHAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW IS
WHOSE CAR THAT BELONGS TO.

10:18.048 --> 10:20.050
YEAH. YEAH, I CAN DEFINITELY
DO THIS. SIMPLE.

10:20.050 --> 10:22.322
JUST GOTTA RUN IT BY
THE HEAD MAN.

10:22.322 --> 10:26.026
THAT'S THE PART OF THE PROCESS
I'D LIKE YOU TO OMIT.
HMM. NO CAN DO.

10:26.026 --> 10:28.328
NAME YOUR PRICE.

10:31.001 --> 10:32.132
ANYTHING?

10:39.109 --> 10:40.771
HEY, YOU.
HEY.

10:40.771 --> 10:43.073
HOW DO YOU ALWAYS KNOW
WHEN I'M HERE?

10:43.073 --> 10:45.345
MM, STALKING. INTERNET.

10:45.345 --> 10:48.048
PAID INFORMANTS.
YOU KNOW, THE USUAL.

10:48.048 --> 10:50.180
MM-HMM.

10:50.180 --> 10:53.123
I, UM, I BROUGHT YOU A BOOK.

10:53.123 --> 10:56.757
IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITES, AND IT
HELPED ME A LOT WITH MY MOM.

11:02.232 --> 11:04.995
I WISH...

11:04.995 --> 11:07.297
I WISH YOU'D TELL ME
WHEN YOU'RE GETTING CHEMO.

11:10.370 --> 11:13.273
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO FEEL OBLIGATED TO COME.

11:13.273 --> 11:17.207
IT'S NOT AN OBLIGATION.

11:25.085 --> 11:26.787
(man speaks indistinctly)

11:26.787 --> 11:29.689
(siren wailing)
(police radio chatter)

11:36.426 --> 11:38.298
L.A.P.D. CALLED.

11:38.298 --> 11:40.370
SOMEONE CLAIMING TO BE MI6

11:40.370 --> 11:44.104
USED MY NAME TO GET ACCESS
TO A CRIME SCENE.

11:44.104 --> 11:46.106
HELLO, DEMETRI.
YOU'RE LOOKING WELL.

11:46.106 --> 11:48.408
YOU, TOO, FIONA.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.981
SO, UH, I'M GUESSING YOU DIDN'T
FLY ALL THE WAY IN FROM LONDON

11:50.981 --> 11:52.843
JUST 'CAUSE YOU MISSED ME.

11:52.843 --> 11:56.116
NO. ANDREW WEEKS WAS SUPPOSED
TO DIE ON MARCH THE 2nd

11:56.116 --> 11:59.289
FROM A DRUG ALLERGY,
BUT HE SURVIVED THE DATE.

11:59.289 --> 12:02.222
HE MADE A BIG DEAL
OUT OF IT, TOO, HUH?
HIS WIFE HEARD HIM FALL,

12:02.222 --> 12:04.224
CAME RUNNING OUT
AND FOUND HIM DEAD.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.997
NO SIGN OF ANYONE COMING
IN OR OUT OF THE HOUSE.

12:06.997 --> 12:08.999
IF I'M LIVING
ON BORROWED TIME,

12:08.999 --> 12:12.002
I MIGHT AVOID
A ROOM FULL OF GUNS.
EXCEPT HE WASN'T SHOT.

12:12.002 --> 12:14.134
HE WAS BLEEDING
FROM THE MOUTH AND NOSE,

12:14.134 --> 12:16.736
SO FORENSICS FIELD-TESTED
HIS COFFEE.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.269
IT SHOWED POSITIVE
FOR WARFARIN.
RAT POISON?

12:19.269 --> 12:22.442
THAT EXPLAINS THE BLEEDING.

12:22.442 --> 12:25.075
I DON'T GET IT.

12:25.075 --> 12:28.178
YOU GOT A ROOM FULL OF GUNS,
AND YOU POISON A GUY. WHY?

12:28.178 --> 12:30.480
WEEKS WAS SUPPOSED TO DIE
FROM A DRUG ALLERGY,

12:30.480 --> 12:32.322
NOT A GUNSHOT WOUND.

12:32.322 --> 12:35.325
I THINK THE KILLER WAS TRYING
TO GET AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE

12:35.325 --> 12:37.327
TO THE ORIGINAL
CAUSE OF DEATH.

12:37.327 --> 12:40.530
THAT WAS IN HIS PAPERS.
THESE ARE DIRECTIONS
TO A BLUE HAND GATHERING.

12:40.530 --> 12:42.532
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
FOUR BLUE HANDERS

12:42.532 --> 12:45.295
DEAD IN THE L.A. AREA
IN THE LAST THREE WEEKS.

12:45.295 --> 12:48.198
EACH KNEW EXACTLY HOW AND WHEN
THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO DIE

12:48.198 --> 12:50.470
BUT LIVED PAST
THEIR DEATH DATE.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.472
I WAS IN ANAHEIM INVESTIGATING
WHEN I GOT WORD OF THIS ONE.

12:52.472 --> 12:56.476
YOU REALLY THINK SOMEONE'S
TO TRYING KNOCK OFF SURVIVORS?
IT'S JUST A HUNCH.

12:58.308 --> 13:01.011
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO SAY?

13:01.011 --> 13:03.153
"WELL, YES, THERE'S GONNA BE
ANOTHER BLACKOUT.

13:03.153 --> 13:05.315
WELL, SORRY, WE JUST CAN'T
TELL YOU WHEN."

13:05.315 --> 13:07.317
SO YOU SAID WHAT YOU HAD TO.

13:07.317 --> 13:10.020
I MEAN, PEOPLE ARE TERRIFIED.
YOU GAVE 'EM HOPE.

13:10.020 --> 13:12.792
NO, WHAT I GAVE THEM
WAS A LIE.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.794
WHAT WOULD GIVE PEOPLE HOPE

13:14.794 --> 13:17.797
IS IF SIMON AND I COULD CRACK
THIS Q.E.D. TECHNOLOGY.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.430
THEN AT LEAST PEOPLE WOULDN'T
BLACK OUT IN THE FIRST PLACE.

13:20.430 --> 13:23.303
WHAT ABOUT THAT CALLER
WHO ASKED ABOUT BRAIN DAMAGE?

13:23.303 --> 13:26.076
I MEAN, I'VE NEVER EVEN
CONSIDERED THAT.

13:26.076 --> 13:28.378
NO. IF THE BLACKOUT
COULD CAUSE BRAIN DAMAGE,

13:28.378 --> 13:31.982
WE WOULD'VE PICKED UP ON IT
A LONG TIME AGO.

13:31.982 --> 13:33.944
I KNOW HOW MUCH
THIS IS WEIGHING ON YOU.

13:33.944 --> 13:37.117
I WISH THERE WAS SOMETHING
I COULD DO TO HELP.
OLIVIA...

13:41.351 --> 13:44.995
YOU ALREADY ARE.

13:44.995 --> 13:46.126
HEY.

13:54.134 --> 13:56.836
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

13:56.836 --> 13:58.308
YOU MAY THINK

13:58.308 --> 14:00.840
THAT PROMISING A JUNIOR ANALYST
A WEEKEND AT THE BUNNY RANCH

14:00.840 --> 14:03.513
WILL GET HIM TO JEOPARDIZE
HIS JOB, BUT IT WON'T.

14:03.513 --> 14:06.846
MY SISTER RAN AWAY FROM HOME

14:06.846 --> 14:09.149
AFTER THE BLACKOUT.

14:09.149 --> 14:11.151
I SAW HER THIS MORNING.

14:11.151 --> 14:14.224
SHE WAS IN A WHITE VAN
WITH THAT LICENSE PLATE.

14:14.224 --> 14:18.128
SO YOU JUST FIGURED YOU'D HAVE
ONE OF MY AGENTS HELP YOU OUT?
I HAVE TO FIND HER.

14:18.128 --> 14:20.530
WE RAN THE PLATE.

14:20.530 --> 14:24.134
VAN WAS STOLEN TWO DAYS AGO
IN SAN FRANCISCO.

14:24.134 --> 14:26.136
TRAFFIC CAM...

14:26.136 --> 14:28.899
PICKED THIS UP.

14:28.899 --> 14:33.143
NOW THAT'S A NICE STORY, SIMON,
BUT HOW ABOUT THE TRUTH?

14:33.143 --> 14:36.046
YOU WANNA TELL ME
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?

14:38.478 --> 14:41.211
I WAS TRYING
TO HAVE HER COME WITH ME.

14:41.211 --> 14:45.515
THE PEOPLE SHE'S WITH, THEY HAVE
SOME SORT OF... HOLD OVER HER.

14:45.515 --> 14:48.158
YOU'RE LYING.
SHE DIDN'T RUN AWAY.

14:48.158 --> 14:50.190
SHE WAS KIDNAPPED.

14:50.190 --> 14:52.923
LOOK AT HER BODY LANGUAGE.
SHE'S TERRIFIED.

14:52.923 --> 14:56.166
HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN
ABOUT THIS?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

14:56.166 --> 14:58.128
OH, COME ON.
DON'T PLAY GAMES WITH ME.

14:58.128 --> 15:00.030
THIS IS YOUR SISTER.
EXACTLY. MY SISTER.

15:00.030 --> 15:03.373
THAT'S WHY I'LL DO ANYTHING
TO FIND HER.

15:03.373 --> 15:05.535
THAT'S WHAT I'M AFRAID OF.

15:05.535 --> 15:07.537
SOMEONE KNOWS
YOU FEEL THIS WAY,

15:07.537 --> 15:09.539
THEY'LL USE IT AGAINST YOU
AS LEVERAGE.

15:09.539 --> 15:12.042
AND CONSIDERING WHAT YOU KNOW,
I'D SAY THEY COULD GET A LOT.

15:12.042 --> 15:14.044
ARE YOU SUGGESTING
I'VE BEEN COMPROMISED?

15:14.044 --> 15:16.046
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN,

15:16.046 --> 15:19.419
BUT I DO KNOW ONE THING--
YOU'VE BEEN LYING.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.121
AND NOW YOU'VE PUT

15:21.121 --> 15:23.353
THE ENTIRE MOSAIC INVESTIGATION
IN JEOPARDY.

15:44.044 --> 15:45.575
(clicks mouse button)

15:45.575 --> 15:47.517
(Lloyd) WHAT DO YOU THINK?

15:47.517 --> 15:50.050
SOMETHING
IN THE RING'S STRUCTURE

15:50.050 --> 15:52.422
HAS TO BE MAINTAINING
SUPERPOSITION.

15:52.422 --> 15:54.724
IT'S KEEPING PEOPLE AWAKE--
BUT HOW?

15:54.724 --> 15:57.727
YOU'RE NOT EVEN LISTENING.

15:57.727 --> 15:59.729
"MAINTAINING SUPERPOSITION"
WAS WHAT YOU SAID,

15:59.729 --> 16:01.961
AND I HAVE NO IDEA.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.134
WELL, DO YOU WANT TO FOCUS
A LITTLE?

16:04.134 --> 16:07.197
WE'VE DONE ENOUGH DAMAGE. MAYBE
WE CAN PUT SOMETHING RIGHT.

16:07.197 --> 16:09.199
LOOK, JUST BECAUSE YOU FEEL
GUILTY ABOUT LYING ON THE NEWS

16:09.199 --> 16:11.201
AND WANT TO SAVE THE WORLD

16:11.201 --> 16:14.044
DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN
ACTUALLY MAKE IT HAPPEN.

16:14.044 --> 16:16.446
YES, WE CAN, AND IT'S NOT
ABOUT FEELING GUILTY.
YEAH, RIGHT.

16:16.446 --> 16:20.050
NO, IT'S ABOUT PREVENTING
MORE DEATHS.
OH, IT'S ALL
LLOYD SIMCOE'S FAULT,

16:20.050 --> 16:21.611
AND NOW HE CAN SAVE THE DAY.

16:21.611 --> 16:25.115
IT'S A LITTLE MESSIANIC,
DON'T YOU THINK?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

16:25.115 --> 16:28.118
OH, MILLIONS OF DEATHS.
(keypad beeps, door whirs)

16:28.118 --> 16:30.120
IT'S AN OVERWHELMING CONCEPT.
NUMBERS LIKE THAT--

16:30.120 --> 16:33.323
YOU LOSE TRACK OF INDIVIDUALS.
THEY FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS.
(beeps, whirs)

16:33.323 --> 16:36.266
A SINGLE PERSON
DOESN'T EVEN MATTER.
OKAY, NOW YOU'RE LOSING ME.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.330
MY SISTER.

16:40.330 --> 16:42.372
ANNABELLE? SO WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

16:42.372 --> 16:45.375
SHE'S BEEN KIDNAPPED.
WHEN?

16:45.375 --> 16:47.477
A FEW DAYS
AFTER THE BLACKOUT.

16:47.477 --> 16:49.539
WHY WOULD ANYONE KIDNAP
YOUR SISTER?

16:49.539 --> 16:52.442
I HAVE NO IDEA.
WHAT DO THE POLICE SAY?

16:52.442 --> 16:55.445
WELL, THE FBI ARE ON IT.
THERE'S NOTHING MORE I CAN DO.

16:55.445 --> 16:58.088
WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?
I WOULD'VE HELPED.

16:58.088 --> 17:00.190
OH, YEAH? HOW?

17:00.190 --> 17:02.122
W-WELL, I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I-I--

17:02.122 --> 17:05.725
NOW I JUST FEEL USELESS.
WELL IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU, LLOYD.

17:05.725 --> 17:08.228
I HAD TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATION
AS BEST I COULD FOR ANNABELLE.

17:08.228 --> 17:11.061
NOW I'M SORRY I DIDN'T
KEEP YOU IN THE LOOP.

17:11.061 --> 17:12.762
I'VE BEEN KINDA BUSY.

17:17.267 --> 17:20.570
WHY WOULD HE HIDE THE FACT
THAT HIS SISTER WAS KIDNAPPED?

17:20.570 --> 17:22.112
THE POLYGRAPH'S INCONCLUSIVE.

17:22.112 --> 17:24.644
YOU REALLY THINK
HE'S COMPROMISED?

17:24.644 --> 17:26.416
THERE'S NOTHING CONCRETE,
BUT... (sighs)

17:26.416 --> 17:29.379
LOOK, MARK, I DON'T LIKE THIS
SITUATION ANY MORE THAN YOU DO,

17:29.379 --> 17:31.151
BUT WE NEED SIMON.

17:31.151 --> 17:33.153
WE'LL LOOK FOR HIS SISTER.

17:33.153 --> 17:36.126
FIND HER, AND FIND OUT
WHAT THEY WANT FROM HIM.

17:36.126 --> 17:38.128
(school bell rings)

17:38.128 --> 17:42.162
(Demetri) I NEVER THOUGHT WE'D
BE TALKING TO THIS GUY AGAIN.

17:42.162 --> 17:45.165
EVERYONE, NEXT WEEK'S READING...

17:45.165 --> 17:46.536
SCHOPENHAUER.

17:46.536 --> 17:50.340
(indistinct conversations)

17:50.340 --> 17:53.773
MR. SLINGERLAND?

17:55.505 --> 17:57.407
AGENT NOH.

17:57.407 --> 17:59.409
I'M SO GLAD
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

17:59.409 --> 18:02.152
THIS IS INSPECTOR BANKS.

18:02.152 --> 18:04.814
I REMEMBER YOU, TOO.
MR. SLINGERLAND.

18:04.814 --> 18:07.117
WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:07.117 --> 18:09.819
DO YOU RECOGNIZE THIS MAN?

18:09.819 --> 18:14.194
YEAH, THAT'S ANDREW.
ANDY WEEKS.

18:14.194 --> 18:16.866
I REMEMBER SEEING HIM
AT THE BLUE HAND GATHERINGS.

18:16.866 --> 18:19.669
THAT WAS A WHILE AGO. I'M NOT
REALLY INTO THAT ANYMORE.

18:19.669 --> 18:22.632
WHY DO YOU ASK?
HE'S DEAD.

18:22.632 --> 18:24.874
HOW?

18:24.874 --> 18:26.105
MURDERED.

18:29.439 --> 18:32.612
OOH. (exhales deeply)

18:32.612 --> 18:34.284
POOR ANDY.

18:35.785 --> 18:38.117
UH...

18:38.117 --> 18:40.820
GUESS HE THOUGHT
HE WAS IN THE CLEAR.

18:40.820 --> 18:43.693
BUT I SUPPOSE THE UNIVERSE
HAS TO, UH, BALANCE ITSELF.

18:43.693 --> 18:44.824
EXCUSE ME?

18:44.824 --> 18:46.896
LIFE IS ENERGY, YOU SEE.

18:46.896 --> 18:48.898
AS EACH NEW LIFE BEGINS,
ANOTHER ENDS.

18:48.898 --> 18:51.130
AND IF YOU MESS
WITH THAT BALANCE,

18:51.130 --> 18:54.133
THE UNIVERSE PUSHES BACK.
ANDY WAS A GOOD GUY. I'M SORRY.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.135
WE NEED YOU TO PUT TOGETHER
A LIST OF THE BLUE HANDERS

18:56.135 --> 18:59.609
WHO KNEW MR. WEEKS.
CAN YOU DO THAT FOR US?
BE HAPPY TO.

18:59.609 --> 19:01.841
AND YOU MIGHT WANT
TO BE CAREFUL.

19:01.841 --> 19:04.143
WE THINK SOMEONE'S
KILLING THE PEOPLE

19:04.143 --> 19:06.276
THAT LIVED PAST
THEIR DEATH DATES--

19:06.276 --> 19:09.919
PEOPLE LIKE YOU.
SO YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO GO ON TELEVISION

19:09.919 --> 19:13.823
AND ANNOUNCE IT TO THE WORLD?
JUST WATCH YOU BACK,
IS WHAT WE'RE SAYING.

19:13.823 --> 19:15.485
I WILL, AGENT NOH.

19:15.485 --> 19:17.487
(Bryce) GABRIEL'S BLOOD WORK
CAME BACK.

19:17.487 --> 19:19.529
SO BESIDES HIS FEET,
EVERYTHING SEEMS OKAY.

19:19.529 --> 19:21.531
THE LEFT FOOT LOOKS GOOD.

19:21.531 --> 19:23.533
HIS RIGHT STILL LOOKS
PRETTY BAD.

19:23.533 --> 19:25.535
OKAY, WELL, LET'S FINISH UP
THE ANTIBIOTICS,

19:25.535 --> 19:27.767
AND WE'LL REEVALUATE TOMORROW.
OKAY.

19:27.767 --> 19:30.500
(woman over P.A.)
ORDERLIES TO ADMITTING.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.502
WHERE'S CHARLIE?

19:32.502 --> 19:34.404
HEY, YOU!

19:34.404 --> 19:37.447
CHARLIE'S AT SCHOOL.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

19:37.447 --> 19:40.680
UH, OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY,
WHICH I COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.212
(chuckles)

19:42.212 --> 19:44.354
DYLAN WAS HOPING TO SEE YOU,

19:44.354 --> 19:46.586
AND, UM, SO WAS I.

19:46.586 --> 19:48.258
HI.

19:48.258 --> 19:49.859
HI.

19:49.859 --> 19:50.860
(Gabriel) LLOYD?

19:52.492 --> 19:53.823
LLOYD SIMCOE?

19:53.823 --> 19:56.496
LLOYD? I KNEW IT.
I KNEW IT.

19:56.496 --> 20:00.199
I SAID IT WOULD HAPPEN. I SAW IT
WOULD HAPPEN. I-I KNEW IT.
I BEG YOUR PARDON?

20:00.199 --> 20:02.702
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
WITH OLIVIA.

20:02.702 --> 20:06.576
SHE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE
WITH THE OTHER ONE.
OKAY, GABRIEL, LET'S GO. COME
ON. BACK--BACK TO BED. LET'S GO.

20:06.576 --> 20:08.738
NOT THE OTHER ONE.
I NEED MY SHOES.
REMEMBER? YOUR SHOES DIDN'T FIT.

20:08.738 --> 20:11.281
THAT'S WHY YOUR FEET
WERE BLEEDING.
BUT I LIKED THOSE SHOES.

20:11.281 --> 20:15.214
I KNOW. WE'LL GET YOU SOME MORE
SHOES. WE WILL. LET'S GO.
â™ª LLOYD AND OLIVIA
SITTING IN A TREE â™ª

20:15.214 --> 20:17.487
YEAH, OKAY.
I'LL EXPLAIN LATER. LET'S GO.
â™ª SITTING IN A TREE, TREE â™ª

20:17.487 --> 20:19.989
(Lloyd) OKAY.
LET'S GO, GABRIEL. INSIDE.
GABE, WE'RE GONNA DO THIS.

20:19.989 --> 20:22.992
COME ON. LET'S GO.
SO GOOD. SO GOOD THAT
YOU'RE TOGETHER WITH LLOYD NOW.

20:22.992 --> 20:25.995
NO, WE'RE NOT TOGETHER.
YOU'RE TOGETHER WITH LLOYD NOW.
IT'S SO GOOD.

20:25.995 --> 20:27.997
YOU KNOW WHAT? WE'RE NOT--
WE'RE NOT TOGETHER, GABE.

20:27.997 --> 20:30.260
WE'RE JUST--YEAH, COMPLICATED.
WE'RE--WE'RE...

20:30.260 --> 20:32.462
YOU'RE THE BEST THING
SINCE SLICED BREAD. YES?

20:32.462 --> 20:34.464
OKAY.
YOU'RE--YOU'RE THE BEST THING
SINCE SLICED BREAD.

20:34.464 --> 20:37.567
IN YOU GO.
(grunts)

20:37.567 --> 20:39.569
CAN I COME IN?

20:39.569 --> 20:41.941
BROUGHT LUNCH. HI, GABRIEL.
WHERE'S THE BEEF?

20:41.941 --> 20:44.844
I GOT IT RIGHT HERE.
GO AHEAD.

20:49.819 --> 20:51.781
SO HOW'S HE DOING?

20:51.781 --> 20:54.384
UH, HE'S BETTER.
GOOD.

20:54.384 --> 20:56.386
WE GOT A LOT OF QUESTIONS,

20:56.386 --> 20:58.388
AND I'M GONNA HAVE TO
BRING HIM INTO THE FBI.

20:58.388 --> 21:01.030
YOU KNOW WHAT? HE HASN'T
FINISHED HIS I.V. ANTIBIOTICS.

21:01.030 --> 21:03.032
HE NEEDS A BRAIN SCAN.

21:03.032 --> 21:05.865
HE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

21:05.865 --> 21:07.867
WOULD IT BE ALL RIGHT

21:07.867 --> 21:10.370
IF I JUST ASK HIM
A FEW QUESTIONS HERE, THEN?

21:10.370 --> 21:11.701
SURE.

21:11.701 --> 21:12.942
THANK YOU.

21:14.874 --> 21:16.406
HEY, BUDDY.

21:16.406 --> 21:19.379
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?
I FOUND THIS IN YOUR THINGS.

21:19.379 --> 21:21.651
YOU WANNA TELL ME
WHAT THIS IS?

21:24.454 --> 21:26.956
MY BOOK. IT'S ALL THERE.

21:26.956 --> 21:29.989
BUT WHAT IS THIS
A PICTURE OF?

21:29.989 --> 21:32.362
GABRIEL, THIS IS IMPORTANT.

21:32.362 --> 21:34.364
I SAW IT.

21:34.364 --> 21:37.026
I WAS THERE, ON A TRIP.

21:37.026 --> 21:38.768
I SAW IT.

21:46.035 --> 21:47.977
A FLASH-FORWARD.

21:47.977 --> 21:51.411
OH, NO. OH, NO! OH, NO!
I DON'T LIKE PICKLES!

21:51.411 --> 21:54.344
OKAY, IT'S OKAY.
I DON'T LIKE PICKLES!

21:54.344 --> 21:58.017
I-I DON'T LIKE LETTUCE!
I-I HATE ONIONS! I...

21:58.017 --> 22:00.990
I LIKE TOMATOES.
I LIKE--I LIKE TOMATOES.

22:07.357 --> 22:10.360
NOW WHERE ARE WE?
STARTING FROM WHERE
WE FIRST PICK UP

22:10.360 --> 22:12.402
THE VAN CAMPOS' SISTER WAS IN--
6th STREET BRIDGE.

22:12.402 --> 22:13.903
THEN WE HEADED SOUTH.

22:13.903 --> 22:15.935
WE PICKED THEM UP HERE,
AND THEN HERE,

22:15.935 --> 22:18.568
AND THEN THEY HEAD
INTO THIS WEIRD ZONE DOWNTOWN.

22:18.568 --> 22:20.009
EIGHT BLOCKS WIDE.

22:20.009 --> 22:22.011
COVERAGE THEIR IS SKETCHY,
SO WE LOST THEM.

22:22.011 --> 22:24.714
YOU CAN'T GET ME
ANY MORE THAN THAT?
I'M NOT A MAGICIAN.

22:24.714 --> 22:27.417
ANY WAY WE CAN PICK UP THE VAN
COMING OUT OF THAT ZONE?

22:27.417 --> 22:29.419
WELL, THERE ARE
OVER A HUNDRED EXITS.

22:29.419 --> 22:31.421
IT'D TAKE AT LEAST
A DAY AND A HALF

22:31.421 --> 22:33.723
TO GO THROUGH ALL THAT FOOTAGE.
WELL, IT'S ONLY EIGHT BLOCKS.

22:33.723 --> 22:37.527
WE CAN DO A SWEEP IN LESS TIME
THAN WHIZ KID HERE.
MM.

22:37.527 --> 22:38.988
(Simon) YOU FOUND SOMETHING.

22:38.988 --> 22:41.961
JUST FOLLOWING UP ON A TIP.
I'M COMING WITH YOU.

22:41.961 --> 22:43.993
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
YES, I AM.

22:43.993 --> 22:46.035
NO, YOU'RE NOT!
LISTEN TO ME, SIMON.

22:46.035 --> 22:48.037
YOU'RE HERE FOR ONE REASON
AND ONE REASON ONLY--

22:48.037 --> 22:50.870
TO WORK ON THE Q.E.D.
YOUR VOLUNTEERING HERE

22:50.870 --> 22:53.573
IS STARTING TO FEEL
A LITTLE CONVENIENT.

22:53.573 --> 22:55.875
I DON'T TRUST YOU, SIMON.
NOT FOR A MINUTE.

22:55.875 --> 22:58.047
THAT'S YOUR PREROGATIVE.
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT IT IS,

22:58.047 --> 23:01.110
AND THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK OUT
TOO WELL FOR YOU.

23:01.110 --> 23:03.553
RIGHT NOW I'M GONNA
GO GET YOUR SISTER BACK.

23:03.553 --> 23:06.556
AND AFTER I DO, YOU AND I ARE
GONNA HAVE A LITTLE SIT-DOWN.

23:06.556 --> 23:09.058
(pushes button)
NO MORE LYING.

23:25.835 --> 23:28.838
(typing)

23:39.519 --> 23:41.521
THEY SAID WANT
YOU AND THE RING.

23:41.521 --> 23:43.823
THEY GOT YOUR MESSAGE,
AND THEY'RE SENDING ONE BACK.

23:43.823 --> 23:45.725
YOU HAVE 12 HOURS,
OR THEY'LL KILL ME.
ANNABELLE.

23:45.725 --> 23:48.127
PLEASE, SIMON.
GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANT.

24:16.526 --> 24:17.987
THANKS FOR COMING BY.

24:17.987 --> 24:20.990
I WANTED TO GO OVER
YOUR LATEST SEROLOGIES WITH YOU.

24:20.990 --> 24:23.533
YOUR TUMOR MARKERS
ARE UNDETECTABLE.

24:23.533 --> 24:25.535
LYMPHOCYTES
ARE BACK TO NORMAL.

24:25.535 --> 24:28.067
WAIT.

24:28.067 --> 24:31.100
DOES THAT MEAN THAT I'M--
EXPERIMENTAL PROTOCOL
SEEMS TO BE WORKING.

24:31.100 --> 24:34.103
YOUR CANCER IS OFFICIALLY
IN REMISSION.

24:35.545 --> 24:37.206
WHAT? WHAT?

24:37.206 --> 24:39.879
WHAT?
WE'VE BEEN OPTIMISTIC
FOR A FEW WEEKS.

24:39.879 --> 24:41.911
I JUST DIDN'T WANT
TO GET YOUR HOPES UP.

24:41.911 --> 24:44.954
I'VE HAD TWO OTHER ONCOLOGISTS
CHECK THOSE RESULTS,

24:44.954 --> 24:46.616
AND IT'S WORKING.

24:46.616 --> 24:47.917
THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

24:47.917 --> 24:49.589
(chuckles)

24:49.589 --> 24:53.022
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?
GO ON. GET OUT OF HERE.

24:53.022 --> 24:54.864
THE FUTURE AWAITS.

24:56.896 --> 24:58.227
YEAH.

25:00.169 --> 25:01.901
(laughs)

25:04.133 --> 25:06.876
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?
OH. YEAH.

25:06.876 --> 25:08.878
UM, WE HAVE A SHIFT
DOWN AT IMMIGRATION TONIGHT

25:08.878 --> 25:11.080
GIVING FLU SHOTS TO DETAINEES.
CAN YOU HELP OUT?

25:11.080 --> 25:12.782
SURE. HAPPY TO.

25:12.782 --> 25:15.084
OKAY, GREAT. JUST TAKE A LOOK
THROUGH THESE FILES

25:15.084 --> 25:17.086
AND SEE WHAT YOU'RE
GETTING YOURSELF INTO.

25:17.086 --> 25:19.649
DON'T WORRY. IT'S ALL BASIC.
NOTHING YOU CAN'T HANDLE. OKAY?

25:19.649 --> 25:20.820
THANK YOU.

25:35.665 --> 25:37.807
(Demetri)
HAVE YOU BEEN WORKING ALL DAY?

25:37.807 --> 25:39.939
SINCE 5:00 IN THE MORNING.

25:39.939 --> 25:42.011
DO YOU KNOW THIS MAN?

25:42.011 --> 25:44.013
SOMEONE TAMPERED
WITH HIS COFFEE.

25:44.013 --> 25:45.675
YEAH. ANDY.

25:45.675 --> 25:48.047
YOU'RE SURE?
YEAH, HE'S A REGULAR.

25:48.047 --> 25:50.119
HE'S HERE EVERY DAY.
SO AM I.

25:50.119 --> 25:53.182
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW HIM?
UH, YESTERDAY.
HE WAS HERE WITH SOME GUY,

25:53.182 --> 25:55.955
CHATTING AWAY
LIKE THEY WERE OLD PALS.

25:55.955 --> 25:57.957
MADE A BIG DEAL
ABOUT SURVIVING SOMETHING,

25:57.957 --> 26:01.030
HIS WHOLE LIFE
TO LOOK FORWARD TO.
WHAT'D HIS FRIEND LOOK LIKE?

26:01.030 --> 26:03.863
I DON'T KNOW.
TALL, KINDA GEEKY-LOOKING,

26:03.863 --> 26:05.935
WEARING THIS BIG,
UGLY HORSESHOE RING.

26:10.239 --> 26:12.602
(Jeff) LIFE IS ENERGY,
YOU SEE.

26:12.602 --> 26:14.744
AS EACH NEW LIFE BEGINS,
ANOTHER ENDS.

26:14.744 --> 26:17.006
AND IF YOU MESS WITH
THAT BALANCE, THE UNIVERSE...
YOU'RE SURE?

26:17.006 --> 26:20.009
YEAH, I AM.
PUSHES BACK.

26:20.009 --> 26:23.713
"YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU WILL,

26:23.713 --> 26:25.955
"BUT AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT
OF YOUR LIFE,

26:25.955 --> 26:29.889
"YOU CAN WILL
ONLY ONE DEFINITE THING.

26:29.889 --> 26:32.361
NOTHING OTHER THAN THAT THING."

26:32.361 --> 26:34.363
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK
THAT MEANS?

26:34.363 --> 26:36.796
THAT FREE WILL IS A LIE?

26:41.771 --> 26:43.332
EXACTLY.

26:47.206 --> 26:48.908
(door creaks)

26:50.179 --> 26:52.812
WHERE'S MR. SLINGERLAND?

26:52.812 --> 26:55.745
I DON'T KNOW. HE WAS HERE,
AND THEN HE JUST LEFT.

26:55.745 --> 26:58.718
ARE YOU AGENT NOH?

26:58.718 --> 27:01.921
HE WANTED ME
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.
WHAT?

27:01.921 --> 27:04.123
THE UNIVERSE
ALWAYS PUSHES BACK.

27:05.895 --> 27:07.797
YOU MIGHT WANT
TO BE CAREFUL.

27:07.797 --> 27:10.299
WE THINK SOMEONE'S
KILLING THE PEOPLE

27:10.299 --> 27:14.203
THAT LIVED PAST
THEIR DEATH DATES.
SO YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO GO ON TELEVISION

27:14.203 --> 27:16.305
AND ANNOUNCE IT TO THE WORLD?
I'M STILL HERE.

27:16.305 --> 27:19.108
THE UNIVERSE SEEMS TO HAVE
A DIFFERENT PLAN FOR ME.

27:19.108 --> 27:21.040
HE'S TRYING
TO COURSE-CORRECT.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.172
I THINK I KNOW
WHO HE'S GOING AFTER NEXT.

27:23.172 --> 27:25.174
(starts car engine)

27:33.753 --> 27:35.354
CELIA QUINONES,

27:35.354 --> 27:37.656
WELCOME TO YOUR FUTURE.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.829
(tires peal)

27:41.660 --> 27:45.094
(people screaming)

27:45.094 --> 27:47.436
(car alarms blaring)

27:47.436 --> 27:50.439
RUN! CELIA, RUN! RUN!

27:50.439 --> 27:54.673
NOW! CELIA, NOW! RUN!

27:57.106 --> 28:00.780
SOUTH ON GRAND!
HE'S HEADING SOUTH ON GRAND!

28:02.311 --> 28:04.213
FREEZE! FBI!

28:04.213 --> 28:06.015
(gasps, grunts)

28:06.015 --> 28:08.017
(tires screech)
AAH!

28:08.017 --> 28:10.419
UHH!
(woman) OH, MY GOD!

28:10.419 --> 28:12.421
NO! CELIA!
(woman) SOMEONE GET HELP!

28:12.421 --> 28:15.064
SHE JUST RAN IN FRONT OF ME!
I COULDN'T STOP!

28:15.064 --> 28:16.966
SHE'S STILL ALIVE.
SHE'S STILL ALIVE.

28:16.966 --> 28:21.831
E.M.T.s TO GRAND AND 6th.
PRIORITY 3! CODE 1! MOVE!

28:21.831 --> 28:24.904
SHE WAS JUST THERE, DEMETRI.
SHE'S ALL RIGHT. STAY WITH HER!

28:28.007 --> 28:31.010
(gasping)

28:34.313 --> 28:38.187
SHE'S NOT DEAD.
SHE'S ALIVE. YOU FAILED.

28:38.187 --> 28:40.219
NOT YET.

28:40.219 --> 28:42.792
ANYWAY... (exhales deeply)

28:42.792 --> 28:44.493
IT'S NOT ME.

28:44.493 --> 28:46.996
IT'S THE UNIVERSE,

28:46.996 --> 28:48.898
WHICH NEVER FAILS.

28:48.898 --> 28:53.302
(groaning)

28:53.302 --> 28:55.905
IT'S FUNNY.

28:55.905 --> 28:58.838
I WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE
AN ANEURYSM,

28:58.838 --> 29:01.040
BUT YOU KILLED ME INSTEAD.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.312
GETS DONE EITHER WAY.

29:05.274 --> 29:09.348
SEE YOU SOON... SPORT.

29:12.952 --> 29:14.954
(exhales sharply)

29:38.047 --> 29:41.210
(car alarm chirps)

29:43.552 --> 29:45.214
SIMON.

29:45.214 --> 29:48.217
HERE TO MAKE UP
FOR MY BAD BEHAVIOR.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

29:48.217 --> 29:51.060
YOU'VE BEEN UNDER
A LOT OF STRESS LATELY.

29:51.060 --> 29:53.062
I JUST WANTED TO SAY THANKS.

29:53.062 --> 29:54.964
FOR WHAT?

29:54.964 --> 29:57.026
CAMBRIDGE,
THE BREWSCHLAGGER FELLOWSHIP,

29:57.026 --> 29:59.468
FOR GETTING ME INTO N.L.A.P.

29:59.468 --> 30:03.102
I DID IT FOR SELFISH REASONS,
SIMON. YOU MAKE ME LOOK GOOD.

30:03.102 --> 30:05.835
GRACIOUS AS WELL. YOU HELPED
ME OUT AND YOU KNOW IT.

30:05.835 --> 30:09.238
I WOULDN'T BE ANYWHERE
WITHOUT YOU.
(chuckles)
OKAY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

30:11.480 --> 30:14.313
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T TELL YOU
ABOUT ANNABELLE. TRULY, I AM.

30:14.313 --> 30:17.346
I SHOULD'VE MONTHS AGO.
IT'S BEEN EATING AWAY AT ME,

30:17.346 --> 30:19.518
AND I'VE BEEN PRETENDING
I WAS FINE.

30:19.518 --> 30:21.120
I SHOULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING.

30:21.120 --> 30:24.093
WELL, I'M--I'M SORRY
I COULDN'T HELP.

30:24.093 --> 30:26.095
I WOULD HAVE, YOU KNOW.

30:26.095 --> 30:29.098
YEAH, I KNOW YOU WOULD. YOU'RE
THE ONLY REAL FRIEND I HAVE.

30:29.098 --> 30:32.831
(laughs) YOU ARE CLEARLY
IN NEED OF A DRINK. COME ON.

30:32.831 --> 30:35.104
OH, YOU'RE NOT WRONG,
BUT I, UH...

30:35.104 --> 30:37.206
I HAVE TO BE SOMEWHERE.

30:37.206 --> 30:39.038
I'LL SEE YOU, LLOYD.

30:47.276 --> 30:49.848
(siren wailing in distance)
(man speaks indistinctly)

30:49.848 --> 30:52.922
(Bryce) HEY.

30:52.922 --> 30:54.323
HEY! NICOLE.

30:54.323 --> 30:57.226
I'VE BEEN LOOKING ALL OVER
FOR YOU. (chuckles)

30:59.929 --> 31:02.061
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

31:02.061 --> 31:02.962
I, UM...

31:02.962 --> 31:05.134
I, UH...

31:05.134 --> 31:08.137
I HAVE SOMETHING
I HAVE TO TELL YOU.

31:08.137 --> 31:10.439
YEAH. ME, TOO.

31:15.874 --> 31:18.547
OKAY... THEN.

31:18.547 --> 31:20.980
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA
BELIEVE THIS.

31:20.980 --> 31:23.913
MY CANCER IS IN REMISSION.

31:23.913 --> 31:26.885
I KNOW!
OH, MY GOD! BRYCE, THAT'S--
THAT'S AMAZING!

31:26.885 --> 31:28.887
I'M STILL COMPLETELY
IN SHOCK,

31:28.887 --> 31:30.889
AND IT--IT GOT ME THINKING
ABOUT MY FUTURE,

31:30.889 --> 31:34.263
AND I DON'T WANT TO WASTE
ANY MORE TIME.

31:34.263 --> 31:36.365
ARE YOU SURE?
I MEAN, WHAT WE SAW IS--

31:36.365 --> 31:40.329
NO, FORGET WHAT WE SAW.
WE'RE HERE, NOW.

31:40.329 --> 31:43.032
THIS IS ALL THAT MATTERS.

31:53.312 --> 31:56.485
WHAT HAPPENED TO CELIA...

31:56.485 --> 31:59.088
THERE WAS NOTHING
WE COULD DO.

32:01.420 --> 32:04.223
(Al) YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT OUR BIRD.

32:04.223 --> 32:06.425
WHAT IF YOU TAPE THE WINDOW?

32:06.425 --> 32:08.097
HOW DO YOU MEAN?

32:08.097 --> 32:10.099
WELL, IF YOU COVER
THE WINDOW,

32:10.099 --> 32:12.001
THE BIRD MIGHT NOT CRASH
INTO IT.

32:12.001 --> 32:14.163
IT'S A NICE THOUGHT.

32:14.163 --> 32:17.536
BUT I THINK IT'LL PROBABLY JUST
CRASH INTO A DIFFERENT WINDOW.

32:17.536 --> 32:19.568
MAYBE.

32:19.568 --> 32:21.610
BUT IT'S WORTH A SHOT.

32:21.610 --> 32:25.074
(clears throat)

32:27.046 --> 32:30.419
(cell phone rings)

32:30.419 --> 32:31.680
(ring)

32:31.680 --> 32:34.523
(inhales sharply)
IT'S THE HOSPITAL CALLING.

32:40.689 --> 32:42.561
HELLO?

32:42.561 --> 32:45.094
(man) Agent Banks?
Agent Fiona Banks?
YES.

32:45.094 --> 32:47.096
I'm calling
about Celia Quinones

32:47.096 --> 32:49.098
and I'm afraid it's bad news.

32:49.098 --> 32:51.540
Her physical and neurological
injuries are extensive,

32:51.540 --> 32:54.473
and I'm not optimistic about
her chance of survival.

32:54.473 --> 32:56.145
(whispers) OH, MY GOD.

32:56.145 --> 32:58.477
(normal voice) YOU'RE GONNA
CALL AGAIN ON THE 29th

32:58.477 --> 33:01.150
TO TELL ME THAT SHE'S GONE.

33:01.150 --> 33:05.084
Ms. Banks, what happened
to Celia was an accident.

33:05.084 --> 33:08.257
THERE ARE NO ACCIDENTS
ANYMORE.

33:15.494 --> 33:18.097
(Wedeck) Mark, we're running out
of time for Campos' sister.

33:18.097 --> 33:21.100
(Mark) I've covered
a 5-block radius. Only 3 to go.
(cell phone beeps)

33:21.100 --> 33:25.034
(siren wailing in distance,
train whistle blowing)

33:27.776 --> 33:29.278
(lock rattles)

33:35.444 --> 33:39.488
WHOA. I'M SORRY.
SPECIAL AGENT BENFORD. FBI.

33:39.488 --> 33:41.490
LOOKS LIKE THEY GOT YOU
WORKING LATE.

33:41.490 --> 33:43.492
YEAH. SOME CLOWN RAN
RIGHT INTO THIS,

33:43.492 --> 33:45.594
NEARLY TOOK OUT
THE ELECTRICAL BOX.

33:45.594 --> 33:48.097
PULLED INTO THAT WAREHOUSE
DRIVING CRAZY.

33:48.097 --> 33:50.099
THAT'S A LOT OF DAMAGE.

33:50.099 --> 33:52.661
EH. IMAGINE WHAT THE VAN
LOOKED LIKE.

33:52.661 --> 33:54.032
IMAGINE.

33:54.032 --> 33:55.734
(dials cell phone)

33:55.734 --> 33:57.236
(beep)

33:58.537 --> 34:01.610
I THINK I FOUND THE VAN.

34:01.610 --> 34:04.573
PUT ME THROUGH TO S.W.A.T.

34:04.573 --> 34:07.576
(guns cock)
(man) OKAY, MOVE!

34:07.576 --> 34:10.519
NOW GO! MOVE.

34:17.756 --> 34:19.758
(man speaks indistinctly)

34:28.197 --> 34:30.799
IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.

34:30.799 --> 34:32.671
YOU'RE SAFE NOW.

34:32.671 --> 34:34.203
I'M HERE.

34:34.203 --> 34:37.446
(ring)

34:37.446 --> 34:38.577
(ring)

34:38.577 --> 34:41.180
(beep)

34:41.180 --> 34:44.213
YES?
IT'S MARK. WE GOT HER, SIMON.

34:44.213 --> 34:46.715
She's sitting
right next to me.

34:46.715 --> 34:49.087
THANK GOD.
IS SHE ALL RIGHT?

34:49.087 --> 34:51.590
EXHAUSTED, CONFUSED,
BUT PHYSICALLY SHE'S FINE.

34:51.590 --> 34:55.124
CAN I TALK TO HER FOR A SECOND?
I JUST WANNA HEAR HER VOICE.

34:55.124 --> 34:57.126
ALL RIGHT, BUT THEN
YOU AND I NEED TO TALK,

34:57.126 --> 34:59.368
AND YOU NEED
TO TELL ME EVERYTHING.

34:59.368 --> 35:02.271
No more lies, Simon.

35:02.271 --> 35:03.772
FINE. (sighs)

35:05.604 --> 35:07.576
HE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.

35:07.576 --> 35:10.479
(siren wailing in distance,
helicopter whirring overhead)

35:10.479 --> 35:11.680
SIMON?

35:11.680 --> 35:14.843
BELLE. IS THAT REALLY YOU?

35:14.843 --> 35:17.686
I'M REALLY TIRED, SIMON.

35:17.686 --> 35:21.290
I WANNA GO HOME AND SEE MOM.

35:21.290 --> 35:24.653
I KNOW. I JUST WANTED
TO MAKE SURE YOU WERE SAFE.

35:24.653 --> 35:27.456
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,
BABY SISTER, REMEMBER...

35:27.456 --> 35:29.158
I LOVE YOU.

35:29.158 --> 35:32.201
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

35:32.201 --> 35:35.764
GOOD-BYE, BELLE.

35:39.438 --> 35:41.770
SIMON.
Good-bye, Mark.

35:41.770 --> 35:43.872
(beep)

35:55.354 --> 35:57.386
(door opens)

36:00.158 --> 36:03.292
HE TOOK THE DAMN RING.

36:13.242 --> 36:15.244
UH, WHAT AM I LOOKING AT?

36:15.244 --> 36:18.277
SO THIS IS GABRIEL McDOW'S
BRAIN. NO BRAIN DAMAGE.

36:18.277 --> 36:21.210
AND HE HAD HUNDREDS
OF FLASH-FORWARDS.

36:21.210 --> 36:25.354
NOW THESE ARE TAKEN FROM PEOPLE
WHO WERE BEING SCANNED

36:25.354 --> 36:27.886
AT THE TIME OF THE BLACKOUT
ON OCTOBER 6th. SAME THING.

36:27.886 --> 36:28.887
NO DAMAGE.

36:28.887 --> 36:30.789
NOTHING. NOTHING UNUSUAL.

36:30.789 --> 36:34.693
SO YOU WEREN'T LYING ABOUT THIS
IN YOUR INTERVIEW.

36:34.693 --> 36:38.196
THANKS. MAKES ME FEEL
A BIT BETTER.

36:38.196 --> 36:40.198
GOOD.

36:40.198 --> 36:42.771
WELL, SO THIS McDOW
IS A SAVANT?

36:42.771 --> 36:45.203
YEAH. HE'S PRETTY
HIGH-FUNCTIONING.

36:45.203 --> 36:47.336
INCREDIBLE MEMORY.

36:47.336 --> 36:51.209
AND HE THINKS
WE SHOULD BE TOGETHER.

36:51.209 --> 36:52.611
UH...

36:52.611 --> 36:55.684
THAT'S WHAT HE SAW
IN HIS FLASH-FORWARDS.

36:55.684 --> 36:58.287
WERE WE HAPPY?

37:01.219 --> 37:03.522
I KNOW HOW I FELT IN MINE.

37:08.927 --> 37:12.901
(knock on door)

37:12.901 --> 37:14.403
(knock on door)

37:15.864 --> 37:19.408
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

37:21.740 --> 37:24.713
(Olivia) I WAS JUST LEAVING.

37:27.546 --> 37:31.950
THANKS FOR THE SCANS, OLIVIA.
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
YEAH, SURE. EXCUSE ME.

37:31.950 --> 37:33.952
SEE YOU LATER.
BYE, MARK. I'LL CALL YOU.

37:41.890 --> 37:44.032
SIMON CAMPOS
HAS DISAPPEARED.

37:44.032 --> 37:45.694
WHAT?

37:45.694 --> 37:47.866
HE'S GONE.

37:47.866 --> 37:50.469
HE CAME TO SEE ME TONIGHT.

37:50.469 --> 37:52.471
IT WAS THE STRANGEST THING.

37:52.471 --> 37:54.873
IT WAS LIKE HE WAS
TRYING TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

37:54.873 --> 37:58.006
THE DAY OF THE BLACKOUT--
ANYTHING ABOUT HIS BEHAVIOR

37:58.006 --> 38:02.581
SEEM... STRANGE?

38:02.581 --> 38:03.882
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

38:03.882 --> 38:06.585
HE WAS IN TORONTO
AT HIS FATHER'S FUNERAL.

38:08.417 --> 38:10.519
UH...

38:10.519 --> 38:13.922
MY DAD DIED.

38:13.922 --> 38:16.325
MY GOD, SIMON.
WHAT HAPPENED?

38:16.325 --> 38:18.927
THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT.
I HAVE TO GO HOME.

38:18.927 --> 38:22.871
YES, OF COURSE. THEN WE'LL
POSTPONE UNTIL YOU GET BACK.

38:22.871 --> 38:25.073
NO. STICK TO THE PLAN.

38:25.073 --> 38:27.075
BUT THE SYSTEM'S
STILL ON STANDBY.

38:27.075 --> 38:30.008
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES
A WEEK MAKE? WHAT'S THE RUSH?
NO, WE'VE WORKED TOO LONG,

38:30.008 --> 38:32.881
TOO HARD AT THIS.
WE HAVE TO STAY ON SCHEDULE.

38:32.881 --> 38:37.886
IT HAS TO BE OCTOBER 6th,
11:00 A.M.

38:37.886 --> 38:39.688
NO DELAYS.

38:43.492 --> 38:46.555
YOU KNOW, I NEVER UNDERSTOOD
WHY HE WOULD MISS THAT MOMENT--

38:46.555 --> 38:48.727
I MEAN, AFTER ALL THOSE YEARS
OF WORK,

38:48.727 --> 38:51.400
AND WE COULD'VE CHANGED
THE DATE.

38:51.400 --> 38:54.433
IS SIMON CAMPOS CAPABLE OF
ENGINEERING A GLOBAL BLACKOUT?

38:54.433 --> 38:56.505
HE'S CAPABLE OF ANYTHING.

38:59.508 --> 39:01.740
AND HE ALWAYS HAS A PLAN.

39:05.744 --> 39:07.746
(Zampieron)
ONCE WE REALIZED THAT

39:07.746 --> 39:09.948
HIS INVOLVEMENT IN THE BLACKOUT
WAS DEEPER THAN WE THOUGHT,

39:09.948 --> 39:11.950
I WENT BACK AND I RAN
THIS GAIT ANALYSIS

39:11.950 --> 39:13.982
ON SIMON CAMPOS
AND ON SUSPECT ZERO.

39:13.982 --> 39:15.954
NOT ONLY ARE THEY COMPARABLE
IN HEIGHT, WEIGHT AND AGE,

39:15.954 --> 39:17.726
THEY'RE
A 99th PERCENTILE MATCH

39:17.726 --> 39:20.028
IN SPACIAL-TEMPORAL
AND KINEMATIC CLASSES.

39:20.028 --> 39:22.030
(Wedeck) BUT SUSPECT ZERO
WAS IN DETROIT,

39:22.030 --> 39:24.593
AND WE HAVE MULTIPLE
EYEWITNESSES THAT PUT SIMON

39:24.593 --> 39:27.596
AT HIS FATHER'S FUNERAL
IN TORONTO THE SAME DAY.

39:27.596 --> 39:30.639
I CHECKED INBOUND FLIGHTS
TO AIRPORTS AROUND DETROIT.

39:30.639 --> 39:32.140
ON OCTOBER 6th,

39:32.140 --> 39:34.142
A G4 WITH
CANADIAN TAIL NUMBERS

39:34.142 --> 39:36.144
REQUESTED
AN EMERGENCY MAINTENANCE LANDING

39:36.144 --> 39:38.847
AT WILLOW RUN.
SO THEY WOULDN'T HAVE FILED
A FLIGHT PLAN.

39:38.847 --> 39:41.149
PLANE WAS ON THE GROUND
FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS

39:41.149 --> 39:43.512
THEN RIGHT BACK TO TORONTO.
HE COULD'VE GOTTEN

39:43.512 --> 39:46.485
TO THE STADIUM THEN BACK
TO THE AIRPORT BY THEN.

39:46.485 --> 39:48.156
SHOW ME THAT FOOTAGE AGAIN.

39:52.791 --> 39:56.064
SIMON CAMPOS
IS SUSPECT ZERO.

39:59.898 --> 40:02.601
IF I SHOWED YOU PICTURES,
ANNABELLE,

40:02.601 --> 40:04.773
COULD YOU IDENTIFY
ANY OF THESE GUYS?

40:04.773 --> 40:08.006
WE NEED TO FIND THE MEN
WHO TOOK YOU.

40:08.006 --> 40:12.981
NO. I NEVER SAW ANY FACES.

40:12.981 --> 40:15.043
THEY ALWAYS WORE
THESE WEIRD MASKS.

40:15.043 --> 40:18.747
PLEASE, CAN I GO HOME NOW?

40:18.747 --> 40:20.048
I KNOW YOU'RE TIRED.

40:20.048 --> 40:21.990
JUST ONE MORE QUESTION.

40:21.990 --> 40:23.992
WHAT DID THEY WANT
FROM SIMON?

40:23.992 --> 40:26.755
I TOLD YOU. I DON'T KNOW.

40:26.755 --> 40:28.757
THEY JUST LEFT ME
IN THE VAN.

40:28.757 --> 40:31.429
THEY SAID THEY WERE DONE
WITH ME.

40:31.429 --> 40:33.732
DID YOU OVERHEAR ANYTHING?
ANYTHING AT ALL?

40:35.934 --> 40:38.807
ANNABELLE.

40:38.807 --> 40:41.570
WHAT DID THEY WANT HIM FOR?

40:41.570 --> 40:44.212
I PROMISE YOU.

40:44.212 --> 40:46.615
NOTHING BAD WILL HAPPEN
TO SIMON.

40:47.916 --> 40:50.719
(whispers) THINK REAL HARD.

40:50.719 --> 40:53.882
(normal voice) DID YOU OVERHEAR
ANYTHING? ANYTHING AT ALL?

40:59.057 --> 41:01.960
THEY SAID HE'S GOING TO CAUSE
ANOTHER BLACKOUT.
