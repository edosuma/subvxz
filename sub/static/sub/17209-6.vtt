WEBVTT

00:06.442 --> 00:07.466
What are they doing?

00:07.467 --> 00:09.701
Waitress gave them a
children's menu and crayons.

00:09.702 --> 00:12.704
They're trying to see who
can connect the dots first.

00:12.705 --> 00:13.939
Bear!

00:13.940 --> 00:15.640
Bear on a surfboard!

00:15.641 --> 00:17.476
I knew it. I sensed it.

00:17.477 --> 00:19.044
TEDDY: That's no fair.

00:19.045 --> 00:21.245
My crayon broke.

00:24.916 --> 00:26.618
I wasn't expecting
to see you here, Felix.

00:26.619 --> 00:28.453
I thought you were avoiding Langford's.

00:28.454 --> 00:30.455
Why? Because Emily works
here and she dumped me?

00:30.456 --> 00:31.623
Yes, the truth is, I have not

00:31.624 --> 00:33.658
seen Emily since the breakup,

00:33.659 --> 00:35.494
and I have been avoiding Langford's.

00:35.495 --> 00:36.798
I've also been taking the stairs

00:36.799 --> 00:38.061
instead of using the elevator,

00:38.062 --> 00:39.406
and donning a moustache and beret

00:39.407 --> 00:40.545
for trips through the lobby.

00:40.546 --> 00:42.434
That was you?

00:42.435 --> 00:45.670
Damn, I thought I had me
a Johnny Depp sighting.

00:45.671 --> 00:47.339
But I knew I was okay coming here today

00:47.340 --> 00:49.307
because it's her day off
and she just posted

00:49.308 --> 00:51.109
a picture of herself at the dog park,

00:51.110 --> 00:53.011
which must have been taken earlier

00:53.012 --> 00:56.114
because here you are and here are we.

00:56.115 --> 00:57.282
Hi, Felix.

00:57.283 --> 00:58.349
Good, and you?

01:00.952 --> 01:01.987
What?

01:01.988 --> 01:03.455
I was wondering when we were going

01:03.456 --> 01:05.123
to run into each other,
and now we have,

01:05.123 --> 01:06.458
and it feels right.

01:06.459 --> 01:07.692
The right stuff.

01:07.693 --> 01:10.562
We are astronauts of friendship.

01:10.563 --> 01:12.531
I wasn't sure how we would...

01:12.532 --> 01:14.099
You know, sin...

01:14.100 --> 01:15.563
I'm sorry, this is a little awkward.

01:15.564 --> 01:19.171
Awkward? No, it is goo... d.

01:19.172 --> 01:20.305
Good as gold.

01:20.306 --> 01:21.569
The gold medal of friendship...

01:21.570 --> 01:23.175
- goes to us.
- Oh!

01:23.176 --> 01:26.011
I don't know where to look.

01:26.012 --> 01:29.347
Okay, well, have to get back to work.

01:29.348 --> 01:30.515
You do that.

01:30.516 --> 01:31.849
Work it, girl!

01:33.685 --> 01:36.454
Well, that went better than I thought.

01:36.455 --> 01:39.357
Oh, God, look who's here.

01:39.358 --> 01:40.659
Uch, Rich Eisen.

01:40.660 --> 01:41.726
He always "swings by"

01:41.727 --> 01:43.628
after the ratings come out

01:43.629 --> 01:45.996
to tell me he beat me
and that he's my daddy.

01:48.200 --> 01:49.734
Madison.

01:49.735 --> 01:51.735
Eisen.

01:53.038 --> 01:55.540
Swing by to gloat about the ratings?

01:55.541 --> 01:57.842
Oh, what are ratings, anyway?

01:57.843 --> 02:01.745
Other than a highly accurate way
to determine who your daddy is?

02:04.182 --> 02:06.685
Was the astronaut of
friendship thing weird?

02:06.686 --> 02:08.720
No, no, it was good... it was playful.

02:08.721 --> 02:11.256
Say, Oscar, have you heard?

02:11.257 --> 02:13.158
The Broadcasters Charitable Trust

02:13.159 --> 02:15.560
has named me Humanitarian of the Year.

02:15.561 --> 02:18.029
They want someone to
introduce me at the banquet,

02:18.030 --> 02:19.598
and I thought of you.

02:19.599 --> 02:22.667
You really think I would do
that after you come down here

02:22.668 --> 02:24.636
and insult me in front of my friends?

02:24.637 --> 02:25.903
He'll be there.

02:26.905 --> 02:28.506
I'm sorry, Oscar, but, you know,

02:28.507 --> 02:30.242
you and Rich are on the same network,

02:30.243 --> 02:32.510
and the execs think it would
be "good corporate synergy."

02:32.511 --> 02:34.012
I just got the email.

02:34.013 --> 02:36.281
And with your ratings
being where they are,

02:36.282 --> 02:39.417
i.e., the crapper,

02:39.418 --> 02:43.321
it's probably not a good idea
to make the bigwigs mad.

02:43.322 --> 02:45.456
So we'll see you Friday.

02:46.691 --> 02:49.094
He could use a big wig.

02:49.095 --> 02:51.129
You could use a big wig!

02:51.130 --> 02:52.097
Ah, he's gone.

02:52.098 --> 02:53.164
Just like his hair.

02:53.165 --> 02:55.066
You've got no hair!

02:55.067 --> 02:56.067
Man, he always

02:56.068 --> 02:57.769
has to get the last word in.

02:57.770 --> 02:59.104
He's such a jerk.

02:59.105 --> 03:01.038
Reminds me of my bully
from high school.

03:02.140 --> 03:04.241
I wonder what she's doing now.

03:06.344 --> 03:07.712
I can't believe you got
to get up in public

03:07.713 --> 03:09.214
and give an award to that fool.

03:09.215 --> 03:10.749
Oh, don't worry, I'll buy a table

03:10.750 --> 03:12.884
and we'll all be there to
support you, right, guys?

03:12.885 --> 03:14.319
- Of course.
- Sounds fun.

03:14.320 --> 03:15.553
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Oh, sorry.

03:15.554 --> 03:16.655
- I thought he was talking to me.
- He was asking you.

03:16.656 --> 03:17.689
- But you could go.
- I don't have to go.

03:17.690 --> 03:18.857
- I could go.
- I mean, I'm happy to.

03:18.858 --> 03:20.339
- Doesn't matter.
- Unless it's weird.

03:20.340 --> 03:21.523
- Up to you.
- It's your call.

03:21.524 --> 03:23.228
Oh, I hope there's a bar.

03:23.229 --> 03:25.163
It's okay, Felix, I don't have to go.

03:25.164 --> 03:27.932
No, no, of course we can both go.

03:27.933 --> 03:30.076
It doesn't have to be weird
if we don't want it to be.

03:30.077 --> 03:30.835
Are you sure?

03:30.836 --> 03:31.903
Of course!

03:31.904 --> 03:33.471
This can be the kickoff

03:33.472 --> 03:35.335
to the New Super-Cool
Laid-Back Friendship part

03:35.336 --> 03:36.308
of our relationship.

03:36.309 --> 03:37.309
(both laugh)

03:37.310 --> 03:39.443
- Uh, um...
- Oh, oh...

03:43.381 --> 03:45.116
Yeah, there's a bar.

03:45.117 --> 03:47.319
- Fantastic.
- Oh, thank God.

03:47.320 --> 03:50.689
Subtitle sync and corrections by

03:50.855 --> 03:52.424
OSCAR: <i>Even though I hate</i>

03:52.425 --> 03:54.192
having to say nice things
about that clown,

03:54.193 --> 03:55.660
the speech reads great.

03:55.661 --> 03:56.884
I just got a couple of tweaks.

03:56.885 --> 03:57.862
Hit me.

03:57.863 --> 03:59.798
You see here, when we say,

03:59.799 --> 04:03.301
"Rich Eisen is a good man
who does good things"?

04:03.302 --> 04:04.769
Uh-huh.

04:04.770 --> 04:07.871
Could we lose both of the "goods"?

04:09.941 --> 04:14.878
You want it to read, "Rich Eisen
is a man who has done things"?

04:15.947 --> 04:18.440
Yeah, that's better.

04:20.218 --> 04:22.252
Two questions: What time is
the banquet tomorrow,

04:22.253 --> 04:23.154
and was it just me,

04:23.155 --> 04:25.366
or did you get the sense
that Emily wants me back?

04:26.691 --> 04:29.127
7:30, and say what now?

04:29.128 --> 04:31.363
It just feel like Emily was
sending me signals.

04:31.364 --> 04:34.232
Oh, Felix, I hate to break it to you,

04:34.233 --> 04:36.101
but I think you're in denial.

04:36.102 --> 04:38.503
No, I'm not.

04:38.504 --> 04:39.637
Oh, wait, am I?

04:39.638 --> 04:41.806
(gasps): I am!

04:41.807 --> 04:45.410
Denial, I'm in denial.

04:45.411 --> 04:46.643
Yes!

04:50.115 --> 04:51.515
He's a weird little man.

04:54.252 --> 04:57.088
Okay, I call Eisen "Rich"
throughout the speech.

04:57.089 --> 05:01.758
Are we 100% sure he doesn't
sometimes go by "Dick"?

05:03.561 --> 05:06.164
Oh, no, not the whiteboard.

05:06.165 --> 05:09.768
Last time, he tried to
teach me about Congress.

05:09.769 --> 05:11.736
Thank you, Dani,
for helping me understand

05:11.737 --> 05:13.171
my current emotional state

05:13.172 --> 05:15.540
and showing me a path to recovery.

05:15.541 --> 05:18.843
The five stages of grief
were first defined

05:18.844 --> 05:21.646
by noted psychiatrist
Dr. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross.

05:21.647 --> 05:24.081
That chimp lady?

05:26.050 --> 05:29.254
I am clearly grieving the death
of my relationship with Emily.

05:29.255 --> 05:31.225
But the fact that I can
make that statement

05:31.226 --> 05:34.022
- _
- shows that I am through the first stage.

05:34.023 --> 05:35.460
So long, denial!

05:35.461 --> 05:38.137
- _
- I am no longer in you.

05:38.138 --> 05:39.130
So all I have to do is

05:39.131 --> 05:41.674
get through the next four steps
before tomorrow night's banquet,

05:41.675 --> 05:43.908
and I will be completely over Emily.

05:45.003 --> 05:46.538
I don't think it works that way.

05:46.539 --> 05:50.041
Maybe for chimps.

05:50.042 --> 05:51.876
But you're a human man.

05:51.877 --> 05:54.112
Oscar, you saw how I was
after my divorce.

05:54.113 --> 05:55.513
I was devastated for months

05:55.514 --> 05:57.023
because I couldn't let go of my grief.

05:57.024 --> 05:57.949
I can't go through that again.

05:57.950 --> 05:59.613
I've got to fast-forward
through the pain.

05:59.614 --> 06:01.553
I get that, but tomorrow
is awfully quick.

06:01.554 --> 06:03.588
Oh, I can do it,
I can master my emotions,

06:03.589 --> 06:05.757
knock through the next
four stages in the next...

06:05.758 --> 06:07.959
26 hours and 13 minutes.

06:07.960 --> 06:11.495
Look out, stage two,
I am coming for you!

06:14.232 --> 06:16.300
Oh, no, not the whiteboard.

06:17.669 --> 06:19.070
Hey, Oscar, I slipped Eisen

06:19.071 --> 06:20.505
a copy of your speech last night.

06:20.506 --> 06:21.506
And?

06:21.507 --> 06:23.141
Ah, he hated it.

06:23.142 --> 06:25.310
What? All it was was ass-kissing!

06:25.311 --> 06:26.544
Well, that's the problem.

06:26.545 --> 06:27.985
He picked you because you're rivals.

06:27.986 --> 06:29.450
He wants it to be more like a roast.

06:29.451 --> 06:31.416
He wants me to roast him?

06:31.417 --> 06:35.653
Like the sun roasts his balding head?

06:35.654 --> 06:38.256
Yeah, and then he'll come back
at you with his own jabs.

06:38.257 --> 06:40.492
Ooh, like how Oscar has
a face made for radio?

06:40.493 --> 06:42.427
(laughing)

06:42.428 --> 06:44.496
Or how he smells like
the business end of a baby?

06:44.497 --> 06:46.397
(laughing)

06:46.398 --> 06:50.168
Or how he looks like he's
trick-or-treating as a hamper.

06:50.169 --> 06:52.836
I don't like how quickly
you're coming up with these.

06:57.408 --> 06:58.843
I'm so angry!

06:58.844 --> 07:00.612
I gave her a year of my life

07:00.613 --> 07:02.947
and she chewed me up and spit me out!

07:02.948 --> 07:05.450
Why won't the universe
let me find love?

07:05.451 --> 07:09.621
Why, why, why, why, why?

07:09.622 --> 07:10.955
This isn't working.

07:10.956 --> 07:12.499
We've been at it for nearly an hour.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.559
Eight minutes.

07:14.560 --> 07:15.727
And yet I'm still angry.

07:15.728 --> 07:17.262
I think I know why.

07:17.263 --> 07:19.030
I think it's because my body knows

07:19.031 --> 07:20.598
that this isn't a real fight.

07:20.599 --> 07:23.635
So I'm going to need you
to fight me back, okay?

07:23.636 --> 07:25.299
Just give me everything
you've got, ready?

07:25.300 --> 07:26.622
I'm not going to fight you, okay?

07:26.623 --> 07:28.327
You don't even know
how to defend yourself.

07:28.328 --> 07:29.007
(laughs)

07:29.008 --> 07:30.308
You might be surprised, huh?

07:30.309 --> 07:32.110
Come on, come on, fight me, what?

07:32.111 --> 07:33.978
Or are you chicken?
Hmm? Who's a chicken?

07:33.979 --> 07:37.081
I bet somebody wanted to be
a real boxer, right? Huh?

07:37.082 --> 07:38.883
Not just a boxing teacher.

07:38.884 --> 07:40.852
And you know what they say:
those who can't do...

07:40.853 --> 07:42.486
(yelps)

07:47.592 --> 07:50.827
(weakly): Anger... stage... complete.

07:52.000 --> 07:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:00.529 --> 08:02.130
"Rich Eisen is so bald,

08:02.131 --> 08:04.346
if you stare into his head,
you can see the future."

08:04.347 --> 08:06.822
(laughs): "See the future."

08:06.823 --> 08:08.857
This is going to be
the best speech ever.

08:08.858 --> 08:11.093
He may actually cry.

08:11.094 --> 08:14.296
Man, Oscar, you are going after
this guy with both barrels.

08:14.297 --> 08:16.440
Well, it's bad enough that
he beats me in the ratings.

08:16.441 --> 08:18.058
Now he's getting a humanitarian award?

08:18.059 --> 08:19.501
I mean, people are going to think

08:19.502 --> 08:21.835
he's a better person than me,
which is crazy, right?

08:24.873 --> 08:26.441
Right?

08:26.442 --> 08:28.176
- Yeah, it's crazy. Crazy!
- Absolutely.

08:28.177 --> 08:31.079
I know Eisen asked for this,
but I still don't get why.

08:31.080 --> 08:32.868
Why would you want to be insulted

08:32.869 --> 08:34.249
by your rival at your own event?

08:34.250 --> 08:36.251
Because "He's so dumb,
he thinks Steph Curry

08:36.251 --> 08:39.620
is something you order
at an Indian restaurant."

08:40.856 --> 08:42.590
I'm still workshopping that one.

08:45.093 --> 08:47.529
Hello, daytime drinkers!

08:47.530 --> 08:49.698
Hello, Felix.

08:49.699 --> 08:51.966
Where are the rest
of the Village People?

08:54.103 --> 08:56.104
Well, having worked my way
through the anger stage,

08:56.105 --> 08:58.106
I am now in bargaining, and as such,

08:58.107 --> 08:59.808
I have made a deal with God

08:59.809 --> 09:02.811
that if I am a better person,
He will stop the pain.

09:02.812 --> 09:04.813
So I spent the entire morning
out on the Expressway

09:04.814 --> 09:05.814
picking up garbage,

09:05.815 --> 09:07.449
mostly bottles and cans,

09:07.450 --> 09:08.917
and what I like to think

09:08.918 --> 09:12.720
was a very life-like
prosthetic human ear.

09:14.156 --> 09:16.258
Felix, I get the bargaining part,

09:16.259 --> 09:17.842
but I think God
might have better things

09:17.843 --> 09:19.161
to do with His time.

09:19.162 --> 09:21.396
Like finding me a boyfriend.

09:21.397 --> 09:23.298
Or getting me a refill on my beer.

09:23.299 --> 09:24.565
Whoa!

09:26.301 --> 09:28.303
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm off to play cello

09:28.304 --> 09:30.246
in the lobby of the
Children's Hospital.

09:30.247 --> 09:31.218
I will be performing

09:31.219 --> 09:32.974
Tchaikovsky's Symphony in b minor,

09:32.975 --> 09:36.778
but to keep it fun for the kids,
I'm doing it in C Major!

09:36.779 --> 09:39.513
You hear that, Big Guy?

09:43.318 --> 09:44.986
OSCAR: Felix?

09:44.987 --> 09:47.921
Hello, Oscar, my old friend.

09:50.091 --> 09:51.326
You okay there?

09:51.327 --> 09:53.094
You got ice cream melting on the table.

09:53.095 --> 09:54.962
- Who cares?
- (both gasp)

09:58.500 --> 10:00.163
You guys were right,
I'm being ridiculous.

10:00.164 --> 10:01.670
What's the point?

10:01.671 --> 10:03.104
Why am I trying to get over Emily?

10:03.105 --> 10:04.372
I never will.

10:04.373 --> 10:06.641
And I'll never find love again.

10:06.642 --> 10:10.811
I will always be alone.

10:12.013 --> 10:13.315
Felix.

10:13.316 --> 10:16.184
I know it seems rough right now, but...

10:16.185 --> 10:18.653
(alarm buzzes)

10:18.654 --> 10:20.054
Done with depression.

10:24.676 --> 10:26.584
_

10:26.585 --> 10:28.153
I feel so much better.

10:28.154 --> 10:29.621
I can honestly say I'm at peace

10:29.622 --> 10:31.790
with the fact that Emily and I
broke up, which means...

10:31.791 --> 10:34.059
(laughs)

10:34.060 --> 10:35.260
Acceptance!

10:35.261 --> 10:36.495
Five stages complete!

10:36.496 --> 10:37.796
And...

10:37.797 --> 10:39.606
With an hour to spare
before the banquet,

10:39.607 --> 10:41.471
which gives me time
to tighten up the old pores

10:41.472 --> 10:43.605
with an Umbrian clay mask.

10:45.737 --> 10:46.805
Oscar.

10:46.806 --> 10:48.774
I'm worried about Felix.

10:48.775 --> 10:50.642
That was real pain we just saw.

10:50.643 --> 10:51.576
I think he's losing it.

10:51.577 --> 10:53.979
You know who else is losing it?

10:53.980 --> 10:54.980
Eisen.

10:54.981 --> 10:56.647
If "it" was hair.

10:58.750 --> 10:59.950
Write that down.

11:03.655 --> 11:05.824
Hey, big guy, ready for your speech?

11:05.825 --> 11:08.260
As long as Eisen didn't get hair plugs

11:08.261 --> 11:10.661
or his momma didn't lose any weight.

11:12.698 --> 11:15.333
I am finally going to
get the last word in.

11:15.334 --> 11:17.255
Felix, they sat you and
Emily next to each other.

11:17.256 --> 11:18.519
You going to be okay with that?

11:18.520 --> 11:19.771
Oh, absolutely!

11:19.772 --> 11:21.506
I have successfully
moved our relationship

11:21.507 --> 11:22.674
into "the friend zone."

11:22.675 --> 11:24.209
Oh, good for you.

11:24.210 --> 11:25.913
I didn't think your plan
was going to work.

11:25.914 --> 11:28.181
Now I'm sorry I called you
"that looney-ass dingbat."

11:30.015 --> 11:32.150
Anyway, I'm just glad
you're doing okay.

11:32.151 --> 11:34.534
Oh, thank you... I think it's
going to be a wonderful night.

11:34.535 --> 11:36.054
Oh, there she is!

11:36.055 --> 11:38.123
She looks nice, doesn't she?

11:38.124 --> 11:40.559
Tell me, was one of
the five stages nausea?

11:40.560 --> 11:41.993
Hi, everybody.

11:41.994 --> 11:43.161
(all saying hello)

11:43.162 --> 11:44.796
Hi, Felix.

11:44.797 --> 11:48.066
I know that things have been
a little bit weird between us,

11:48.067 --> 11:50.335
but I'm really glad that
we can be here as friends.

11:50.336 --> 11:52.304
Yes!

11:52.305 --> 11:53.537
Friends!

11:55.874 --> 11:57.476
♪ Keep smiling ♪

11:57.477 --> 11:59.211
♪ Keep shining ♪

11:59.212 --> 12:04.182
♪ Knowing you can always count on me ♪

12:04.183 --> 12:06.251
♪ For sure ♪

12:06.252 --> 12:10.655
♪ That's what friends are for! ♪

12:10.656 --> 12:12.523
I am not okay.

12:25.011 --> 12:26.012
(gasping)

12:26.013 --> 12:28.081
I need to talk to you.

12:28.082 --> 12:30.383
So we're pretending you didn't
just chug my appletini?

12:30.384 --> 12:32.118
Okay.

12:32.119 --> 12:34.142
I don't think that me being
here is good for Felix.

12:34.143 --> 12:36.377
I thought that since we
were such good friends

12:36.378 --> 12:38.122
- before we became...
- Don't say, "lovers."

12:38.123 --> 12:39.529
...lovers...

12:39.530 --> 12:41.498
that we could just go back
to the way things were.

12:41.499 --> 12:43.433
But clearly he's not ready.

12:43.434 --> 12:44.434
Maybe I should just go.

12:44.435 --> 12:45.902
No, I know things are hard,

12:45.903 --> 12:47.303
but Felix is really struggling,

12:47.304 --> 12:49.305
and he worked really
hard to get this far.

12:49.306 --> 12:52.308
So if you bail now,
it'll just set him back.

12:52.309 --> 12:53.943
You're right.

12:53.944 --> 12:55.978
Hang in there, okay?

12:59.215 --> 13:01.217
I'm going to need you
to pour the next one

13:01.218 --> 13:02.551
just right down my throat.

13:06.456 --> 13:07.490
Dani D!

13:07.491 --> 13:09.659
What do you want, Rich Eisen?

13:09.660 --> 13:11.494
Just to say thank you for coming.

13:11.495 --> 13:13.351
By the way, the door's always open

13:13.352 --> 13:14.336
if you want to come work

13:14.337 --> 13:16.766
for the number-one
sports talk radio show.

13:16.767 --> 13:18.301
Not interested.

13:18.302 --> 13:20.125
Oscar might not have as
many listeners as you,

13:20.126 --> 13:21.905
but those who do listen love him.

13:21.906 --> 13:27.509
I wonder if they'll still feel
the same way after tonight.

13:29.079 --> 13:30.512
What you talkin' 'bout, Eisen?

13:33.249 --> 13:35.018
Mmm.

13:35.019 --> 13:36.519
The salad is delicious.

13:36.520 --> 13:37.987
What are these, raisins?

13:37.988 --> 13:39.155
Cranberries.

13:39.156 --> 13:39.923
Oh.

13:39.924 --> 13:42.759
Raisins!

13:42.760 --> 13:43.660
They're red.

13:43.661 --> 13:46.196
Are you hearing this?

13:46.197 --> 13:48.131
What salad is <i>she</i> eating?

13:48.132 --> 13:50.333
You okay, Felix?

13:50.334 --> 13:52.635
Huh? Oh, yes, I'm fine, I'm just...

13:52.636 --> 13:54.659
I guess maybe in racing
through my stages of grief,

13:54.660 --> 13:57.160
I left a couple of drops of
anger in the old tank, but...

13:58.508 --> 13:59.476
Now I'm fine.

13:59.477 --> 14:02.378
My tank is empty.

14:02.379 --> 14:04.846
(voice breaking):
I'm an empty shell of a man.

14:06.182 --> 14:08.384
Whoo! Still a little bit
of depression in there, too.

14:08.385 --> 14:11.220
Know what? I'm fine,
I'm going to be just fine.

14:13.289 --> 14:16.558
Dinner <i>and</i> a show.

14:18.862 --> 14:19.963
Good evening.

14:19.964 --> 14:21.865
And thank you for joining us

14:21.866 --> 14:27.237
as we honor our Humanitarian
of the Year, Rich Eisen.

14:27.238 --> 14:28.738
(applause)

14:28.739 --> 14:31.841
It is now my pleasure
to introduce the man

14:31.842 --> 14:34.043
who will introduce "the man"...

14:34.044 --> 14:35.879
(softly): Hey, hey, hey, hey!

14:35.880 --> 14:37.480
You can't give your insult speech!

14:37.481 --> 14:38.381
It's a trap!

14:38.382 --> 14:39.282
What do you mean?!

14:39.283 --> 14:40.603
Eisen made a weird comment to me,

14:40.604 --> 14:41.908
so I snuck a look at his speech.

14:41.909 --> 14:43.286
He's not going to insult you,

14:43.287 --> 14:45.288
he's going to say
glowing things about you!

14:45.289 --> 14:47.123
It's a setup!

14:47.124 --> 14:49.092
He's taking the high road!

14:49.093 --> 14:51.027
He asks you to say
mean stuff about him,

14:51.028 --> 14:53.363
and then he gets up there
and turns the other cheek.

14:53.364 --> 14:55.498
He comes off smelling
like a rose to the bosses,

14:55.499 --> 14:57.634
while you smell like what
you fertilize a rose with.

14:57.635 --> 15:00.370
He's a diabolical genius.

15:00.371 --> 15:02.510
What do I do? What do I do?

15:02.511 --> 15:05.909
WOMAN: Ladies and
gentlemen, Oscar Madison!

15:05.910 --> 15:08.210
(applause)

15:13.249 --> 15:18.421
I would like to say a few
words about Rich Eisen.

15:18.422 --> 15:20.690
Can't say that.

15:20.691 --> 15:21.890
Not that.

15:22.792 --> 15:24.394
(laughs)

15:24.395 --> 15:25.594
Not that.

15:27.263 --> 15:28.965
Rich Eisen...

15:28.966 --> 15:30.866
is a man...

15:32.068 --> 15:35.205
who does things...

15:35.206 --> 15:36.638
A <i>good</i> man, who does <i>good</i> things.

15:38.508 --> 15:41.711
Maybe it's better if I
speak from the heart.

15:41.712 --> 15:44.581
Rich is my friend.

15:44.582 --> 15:49.052
And a better man you will never see.

15:49.053 --> 15:50.220
Oh...

15:50.221 --> 15:52.388
I'm going to need two seconds.

15:52.389 --> 15:55.491
I'll be damned.

15:55.492 --> 15:59.062
Oscar's going to out-high-road
that son of a bitch.

15:59.063 --> 16:01.931
Did he make me a
better broadcaster? Sure.

16:01.932 --> 16:03.733
But he also...

16:03.734 --> 16:05.235
(cries)

16:05.236 --> 16:07.670
(voice breaking):
...made me a better man.

16:07.671 --> 16:09.572
He inspires me every day...

16:09.573 --> 16:12.909
Wow, I've never seen
Oscar so emotional.

16:12.910 --> 16:14.493
What, a man can't express his feelings?

16:14.494 --> 16:17.061
We have hearts, you know,
broken and otherwise.

16:19.315 --> 16:22.018
Felix, this is hard for me, too.

16:22.019 --> 16:23.519
If you're not ready to be friends,

16:23.520 --> 16:24.921
we don't have to rush into it.

16:24.922 --> 16:26.289
No, no, I'm good.

16:26.290 --> 16:28.024
I just have other friends,

16:28.025 --> 16:31.594
and I'm trying to watch
one of them speak right now.

16:31.595 --> 16:33.997
And that's why not a day goes by

16:33.998 --> 16:37.800
where I don't ask myself,
"What would Rich Eisen do?"

16:37.801 --> 16:40.503
Ladies and gentlemen,

16:40.504 --> 16:43.973
please welcome my hero,

16:43.974 --> 16:47.277
my guiding light,

16:47.278 --> 16:48.278
Rich Eisen.

16:48.279 --> 16:50.445
(applause)

16:53.616 --> 16:55.718
(cheering)

16:55.719 --> 16:57.353
You son of a bitch.

16:57.354 --> 16:59.522
You out-high-roaded me.

16:59.523 --> 17:01.024
Damn right.

17:01.025 --> 17:02.859
Hurts to be the loser for once, huh?

17:02.860 --> 17:05.861
Yeah, well, watch this.

17:07.230 --> 17:09.999
Thank you.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.902
But I simply cannot accept this

17:12.903 --> 17:17.006
while standing so close to someone

17:17.007 --> 17:22.078
whose dedication to the
betterment of his fellow man

17:22.079 --> 17:24.981
so, so far outstrips mine.

17:24.982 --> 17:28.884
This plaque belongs to Oscar Madison!

17:31.754 --> 17:33.923
(applause)

17:33.924 --> 17:36.759
Well, I just found
that so inspirational

17:36.760 --> 17:38.795
that, um...

17:38.796 --> 17:42.531
I'm going to donate $1,000 to...

17:45.702 --> 17:49.706
whatever charity this is,

17:49.707 --> 17:53.008
in the name of Rich Eisen.

17:54.110 --> 17:55.578
A thousand dollars?

17:55.579 --> 17:56.946
I'm going to have to book him

17:56.947 --> 18:00.081
on a hundred personal appearances.

18:01.684 --> 18:03.786
Are you finished, sir?

18:03.787 --> 18:05.088
No.

18:05.089 --> 18:06.155
No!

18:06.156 --> 18:07.457
I'm not finished.

18:07.458 --> 18:09.659
I'm tired of other people deciding

18:09.660 --> 18:11.023
when I'm finished with something.

18:11.024 --> 18:12.643
- Felix...
- No!

18:13.731 --> 18:15.298
I was enjoying this lobster!

18:15.299 --> 18:17.800
I maybe even loved this lobster!

18:17.801 --> 18:20.435
We belong together, and no one
can take it away from me!

18:24.607 --> 18:27.310
Damn, why'd I order the chicken?

18:27.311 --> 18:31.614
And that's why I vow to set up
a fund in Oscar Madison's name

18:31.615 --> 18:33.549
to end the plight of homelessness

18:33.550 --> 18:35.651
once and for all.

18:35.652 --> 18:36.986
(applause and cheering)

18:36.987 --> 18:39.120
Anything?

18:41.057 --> 18:42.058
You win.

18:42.059 --> 18:44.627
I win!

18:44.628 --> 18:46.095
You know...

18:46.096 --> 18:47.662
For the homeless.

18:51.134 --> 18:52.902
Felix?

18:52.903 --> 18:56.506
You want to hand me the lobster?

18:56.507 --> 18:59.809
That's it, nice and slow...

18:59.810 --> 19:01.844
(moans)

19:01.845 --> 19:03.188
I don't know what I was thinking.

19:03.189 --> 19:04.247
I'm such a fool.

19:04.248 --> 19:05.848
No, you were just trying to take

19:05.849 --> 19:07.984
a shortcut through your pain.

19:07.985 --> 19:09.352
I mean, I wish you could,

19:09.353 --> 19:12.422
but it doesn't work that way.

19:12.423 --> 19:15.558
You got your heart broken,
it's going to take some time.

19:15.559 --> 19:17.560
You're right.

19:17.561 --> 19:20.163
And listen, I'm sorry.

19:20.164 --> 19:21.130
For what?

19:21.131 --> 19:22.865
I saw you were struggling,

19:22.866 --> 19:25.001
but I got so caught
up in the Eisen thing

19:25.002 --> 19:26.436
that I didn't help you.

19:26.437 --> 19:30.039
So for however long it takes,

19:30.040 --> 19:31.707
I am going to get you through this.

19:31.708 --> 19:34.143
Thank you, Oscar.

19:34.144 --> 19:35.807
Rich Eisen may have won
the award tonight,

19:35.808 --> 19:37.447
but you are the true humanitarian.

19:37.448 --> 19:41.384
I am a good man.

19:41.385 --> 19:43.004
Who does good things!

19:44.922 --> 19:46.489
Isn't that Eisen's coat and scarf?

19:46.490 --> 19:48.090
Yeah, a scarf!

19:48.091 --> 19:49.959
I mean, he's the worst.

19:49.960 --> 19:52.662
Do you think he'd like to take
the rest of my lobster home?

19:52.663 --> 19:53.662
What do you...

19:54.697 --> 19:57.132
Maybe he would.

20:03.773 --> 20:06.709
♪ That's what friends are for ♪

20:06.710 --> 20:08.144
♪ Keep smiling ♪

20:08.145 --> 20:09.846
♪ Keep shining ♪

20:09.847 --> 20:13.250
BOTH: ♪ Knowing you can
always count on me... ♪

20:18.365 --> 20:21.970
Hey, thanks again for
watching <i>Beaches</i> with me.

20:23.750 --> 20:26.019
No problem... and by the way,
at the end there,

20:26.020 --> 20:29.188
there was just some... dust in my eye.

20:31.091 --> 20:32.259
Sure.

20:32.260 --> 20:33.926
There's dust in our apartment.

20:35.795 --> 20:41.368
So, Felix, I hesitate to ask,
it's totally up to you.

20:41.369 --> 20:42.769
Are you finished with that?

20:42.770 --> 20:44.504
(laughs)

20:44.505 --> 20:48.208
- Yes, yes, I'm sure.
- Oh, thank you.

20:48.209 --> 20:50.042
(Emily laughs)

20:52.178 --> 20:54.614
So what's next, <i>Terms of Endearment?</i>

20:54.615 --> 20:56.783
No.

20:56.784 --> 20:58.718
Next is <i>The Notebook.</i>

20:58.719 --> 21:01.420
Then <i>Terms of Endearment,</i>
then <i>Beaches</i> again.

21:02.822 --> 21:05.158
Why do we have to go back to that one?

21:05.159 --> 21:07.926
(crying): We already know
what happens in that one.
