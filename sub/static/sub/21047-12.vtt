<i>Previously on "blood drive"...</i>

00:03.437 --> 00:06.105
Fiiiight!

00:08.742 --> 00:10.342
If you refuse to kill,

00:10.344 --> 00:13.379
then we just have to properly
motivate you.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.517
The fuck could you have
against me?

00:24.225 --> 00:27.026
Karma? You did this to us!

00:32.232 --> 00:35.334
And then there were two!

00:35.336 --> 00:36.335
You heard the man.

00:36.337 --> 00:37.603
Can only be one primo.

00:37.605 --> 00:40.139
Yes, it is a forfeit!

00:40.141 --> 00:42.307
It is a forfeit! It's over!

00:42.309 --> 00:45.344
It's over!

00:58.625 --> 01:00.626
Primo.

01:00.628 --> 01:03.262
Primo!

01:03.264 --> 01:05.164
Primo.

01:05.832 --> 01:07.499
Talk to me.

01:07.501 --> 01:11.437
I was just asking if you're
excited for your big night.

01:11.439 --> 01:13.372
No better excuse to party.

01:13.374 --> 01:15.541
Couldn't have said it
better myself.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.078
This is Garrett.

01:19.080 --> 01:20.479
<i>They're holding to speak
to primo.</i>

01:20.481 --> 01:22.448
Primo, I have...

01:22.450 --> 01:24.249
And.

01:24.251 --> 01:26.151
They're big fans of mine.

01:26.153 --> 01:28.353
Hang up.

01:29.556 --> 01:32.458
Would you like
to go through the schedule?

01:32.460 --> 01:33.659
Dazzle me.

01:33.661 --> 01:35.327
You'll start with the obligatory

01:35.329 --> 01:35.327
red carpet schmooze.

01:35.329 --> 01:38.464
After that, you'll get
a little time to yourself

01:38.466 --> 01:40.432
in your own private tent.

01:40.434 --> 01:44.636
And finally, the reason
we're all here:

01:44.638 --> 01:47.439
The primo tribute ceremony.

01:47.441 --> 01:50.309
And a camera crew to record it
all for posterity.

01:50.311 --> 01:52.444
- Very important.
- Tribute ceremony?

01:52.446 --> 01:54.213
Like the Olympics?
Like the Olympics.

01:54.215 --> 01:54.213
Like, like... like the emmys,

01:54.215 --> 01:58.350
like the fucking fourth of July
and a goddamned coronation,

01:58.352 --> 02:00.586
all rolled into one!

02:00.588 --> 02:02.688
So three times the chicks.

02:17.471 --> 02:20.139
I love you, primo!

02:21.174 --> 02:22.608
Start kicking ass, primo!

02:22.610 --> 02:24.209
How you doing, sweetheart?

02:24.211 --> 02:26.545
- Primo!
- Primo!

02:26.547 --> 02:28.380
Primo, can I get your autograph?

02:28.382 --> 02:30.649
This is gonna hurt like shit.

02:32.620 --> 02:36.155
Dot the "I," and we're done.

02:36.157 --> 02:37.890
Enjoy it, buddy, but know this:

02:37.892 --> 02:39.625
From here on out,
every girl you bone

02:39.627 --> 02:41.293
will be pretending it's me.

02:43.164 --> 02:45.497
Arthur... Arthur!

02:45.499 --> 02:45.497
You need to talk to me.

02:45.499 --> 02:48.901
It's been a week.
I haven't seen you since...

02:48.903 --> 02:51.937
shoving your sister
into a blood engine?

02:51.939 --> 02:54.373
Shit was badass.

02:54.375 --> 02:55.707
Don't be too hard on yourself.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.176
She had it coming.

02:57.178 --> 02:58.443
What's this?

02:58.445 --> 03:00.445
Looking good, you big
swinging dick, primo!

03:00.447 --> 03:02.614
No snarky comeback?
No kick in the balls?

03:02.616 --> 03:05.517
Love you, primo!

03:05.519 --> 03:07.219
You've changed.

03:07.221 --> 03:08.620
You should try it.

03:08.622 --> 03:10.756
I know who I am, grace.

03:10.758 --> 03:14.693
And I'm fucking fabulous.

03:14.695 --> 03:19.431
Is that not the finest
primo you've ever seen?

03:20.400 --> 03:22.267
I don't know.

03:22.269 --> 03:24.770
He seemed a little
disconnected back there.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.738
Like his heart's not
really in it.

03:26.740 --> 03:29.374
Horseshit. He was born for this.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.710
He's laserfocused on being

03:31.712 --> 03:33.579
the greatest primo of all time,

03:33.581 --> 03:37.583
and nothing is gonna
distract him from his...

03:37.585 --> 03:38.717
Destiny.

03:52.298 --> 03:53.599
Arthur, where are you?

04:12.652 --> 04:15.354
Whoo! Fuck yeah!

04:58.599 --> 05:02.601
Hello, blood driiiive!

05:04.571 --> 05:07.806
To the grease monkeys
and red junkies,

05:07.808 --> 05:11.310
to the bruisers and the losers,

05:11.312 --> 05:14.880
to the manskanks
and sperm banks,

05:14.882 --> 05:18.050
I ask you this...

05:18.052 --> 05:20.719
Who wants to fight the primo?!

05:23.824 --> 05:25.590
I wrote that.

05:49.682 --> 05:51.450
Yeah, primo!

05:53.087 --> 05:55.554
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

05:56.889 --> 05:58.757
What did I tell you?

05:58.759 --> 06:00.492
He's primo to the core.

06:00.494 --> 06:02.794
Wait'll you see the tribute
I have planned.

06:02.796 --> 06:06.631
Respectfully, slink, I'm
the ranking exec on blood drive.

06:06.633 --> 06:08.073
I got a couple suggestions
to make...

06:09.370 --> 06:10.736
Look, I thought we discussed
this already.

06:10.738 --> 06:12.104
I am master of ceremonies,

06:12.106 --> 06:13.438
god of the stage.

06:13.440 --> 06:16.441
This is the ceremony;
That is the stage.

06:16.443 --> 06:18.443
What part of god and master
do you not understand?

06:18.445 --> 06:20.445
Slink, this is about the show.

06:20.447 --> 06:21.680
I can take you global.

06:21.682 --> 06:23.582
All you got to do
is pass me the ball

06:23.584 --> 06:25.517
and let me take you
over the line.

06:25.519 --> 06:27.819
And how can you say no to that?

06:30.790 --> 06:33.792
Sorry, love.
No back nine for you.

06:48.808 --> 06:51.410
Arthur!

06:53.513 --> 06:54.980
Fight! Fight! Come on!

06:54.982 --> 06:56.715
Come on! Right here! Let's go!

07:10.530 --> 07:13.165
Me and my lady
managed to escape.

07:13.167 --> 07:14.766
She's waiting just
outside of town.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.168
You got a lady?

07:16.170 --> 07:17.702
Fuck, dude, bring her
to the party.

07:17.704 --> 07:18.870
She down to clown?

07:18.872 --> 07:20.505
What?

07:20.507 --> 07:22.507
No way. I came to get
you out of here.

07:22.509 --> 07:24.209
Why would I want to do that?

07:24.211 --> 07:25.777
They made me their king.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.480
Easy, dude.
You got to keep it tight.

07:28.482 --> 07:30.015
I got a high metabolism.

07:30.017 --> 07:31.983
And I haven't eaten in weeks.

07:31.985 --> 07:33.785
Food's great, though, right?

07:33.787 --> 07:36.021
Can't remember the last time
I ate nonsynthetic fruit.

07:36.023 --> 07:37.789
Here they bring it
by the bucket.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.825
Whatever I want.

07:39.827 --> 07:41.693
I can see why you
don't want to leave.

07:41.695 --> 07:41.693
I know, right?

07:41.695 --> 07:44.930
Riding around cracking heads,
banging hotties

07:44.932 --> 07:46.231
like it's my job.

07:46.233 --> 07:47.566
Here, try this ipa.

07:47.568 --> 07:49.534
My own craft brew. Super hoppy.

07:49.536 --> 07:51.470
Cheers.

07:52.939 --> 07:55.474
Gnarly eyeball you got there.

07:56.542 --> 07:58.643
What'd they do to you, anyway?

07:58.645 --> 08:01.213
Held me in a dark room
for weeks.

08:01.215 --> 08:03.548
Did things to me...

08:03.550 --> 08:05.517
Things I won't ever forget.

08:05.519 --> 08:06.918
I was a prisoner, man.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.854
A fuckin' lab rat.

08:12.825 --> 08:14.926
They fisted me, man.

08:16.696 --> 08:18.730
Hey, man...

08:18.732 --> 08:19.598
What the fuck?

08:19.600 --> 08:21.600
Sorry, that's...

08:22.502 --> 08:23.502
You're here now.

08:23.504 --> 08:25.971
That's all that matters.

08:25.973 --> 08:28.607
Only thing kept me going
was you.

08:28.609 --> 08:30.275
Knowing you were out here,
fighting the good fight...

08:30.277 --> 08:31.710
Bringing down heart.

08:31.712 --> 08:33.845
Like I said, that was then,
this is now.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.881
You're safe, brother.
Let's keep it light, yeah?

08:37.984 --> 08:40.051
I mean, look at this place.

08:40.053 --> 08:41.886
It's paradise.

08:43.556 --> 08:45.857
You ever seen me happier
than I am right now?

08:45.859 --> 08:47.859
What happened to the good cop?

08:47.861 --> 08:50.929
He took the costume off
and stopped pretending.

08:55.601 --> 08:57.869
Sure about that?

08:57.871 --> 09:01.940
What, this? Sweet jacket?

09:01.942 --> 09:03.108
See, this is me.

09:03.110 --> 09:05.010
The real me.

09:05.012 --> 09:07.579
I'm finally okay with that.

09:07.581 --> 09:09.648
Turns out being bad...

09:09.650 --> 09:11.116
Ain't all that bad.

09:11.118 --> 09:13.752
You should try it.

09:13.754 --> 09:16.755
In fact, it's pretty
fucking great.

09:16.757 --> 09:19.691
I'm not the only one
who feels that way.

09:19.693 --> 09:21.760
I got a whole kingdom
of followers

09:21.762 --> 09:26.731
who just love the smell
of my shit.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.066
Champagne?

09:35.642 --> 09:38.643
<i>The board game</i>

09:38.645 --> 09:40.712
<i>are proud to present</i>

09:40.714 --> 09:43.648
<i>the primo memorial tribute reel.</i>

10:12.846 --> 10:14.946
Look again.

10:28.629 --> 10:30.662
These people don't love you.

10:30.664 --> 10:32.030
They're not here to honor you.

10:33.199 --> 10:35.033
Dude...

10:35.035 --> 10:36.835
They're gonna kill you.

10:51.852 --> 10:54.252
I am never gonna stop, grace.

10:54.254 --> 10:56.421
Not until everything
you love is gone!

11:15.141 --> 11:17.709
Let's go!

11:38.331 --> 11:40.231
Shit.

11:42.436 --> 11:44.436
We may have started
at a primo party,

11:44.438 --> 11:46.404
but it sure as hell
isn't gonna end here.

11:54.013 --> 11:56.848
We have something here for you.

11:58.451 --> 12:00.318
What's with the camera?

12:00.320 --> 12:02.320
We're from heart's
"protégé pilot program."

12:02.322 --> 12:03.988
We're technically
grad students, but...

12:03.990 --> 12:05.857
that was rhetorical, asshole.

12:05.859 --> 12:07.992
You've impressed us.

12:07.994 --> 12:10.495
You're deadly and crazy.

12:10.497 --> 12:13.832
We think you have a future
here at heart enterprises.

12:13.834 --> 12:17.302
I faked my death at majora
to get away from the lesbos.

12:17.304 --> 12:19.471
Plus, you're not really my type.

12:19.473 --> 12:22.373
We've got two femme fatales
for the price of one.

12:22.375 --> 12:24.342
What do you mean, two?

12:24.344 --> 12:26.911
Your sister, grace...

12:26.913 --> 12:30.849
She'll be racing in
this year's blood drive.

12:30.851 --> 12:32.484
You ask me, she's a star.

12:32.486 --> 12:34.419
First she dumps me
in a madhouse,

12:34.421 --> 12:37.222
then she runs off to join
some stupid race?

12:37.224 --> 12:38.823
Put me in the race.

12:38.825 --> 12:41.292
I'll run her ass
right off the road.

12:41.294 --> 12:44.062
Our drivers have already
been finalized.

12:44.064 --> 12:45.997
But your sadistic tendencies

12:45.999 --> 12:47.966
do suit you for
the management track.

12:47.968 --> 12:50.235
We have an opening for you

12:50.237 --> 12:51.536
at heart entertainment.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.404
I don't want your shitty job.

12:53.406 --> 12:56.441
Let me off at the next stop.

12:56.443 --> 12:59.511
Imagine getting out from
under grace's shadow.

12:59.513 --> 13:01.780
You could mindfuck her
to pieces.

13:01.782 --> 13:05.383
She wouldn't even
know it was you.

13:05.385 --> 13:07.886
I'll do it one condition:

13:07.888 --> 13:09.888
I get to kill this motherfucker.

13:09.890 --> 13:11.022
What?

13:11.024 --> 13:12.791
Who, me? Wait, wh... no.

13:15.428 --> 13:17.428
Who's got the goddamn jacket?
Me!

13:17.430 --> 13:19.430
Who's on the 50foot poster? Me!

13:19.432 --> 13:20.999
I'm the fuckin' primo!

13:21.001 --> 13:23.368
They've designed the whole
night around killing you.

13:23.370 --> 13:24.869
Listen, our only option

13:24.871 --> 13:26.337
is to burn rubber
before it's too late.

13:26.339 --> 13:27.572
It doesn't make any sense.

13:27.574 --> 13:31.075
No, I'm the blood drive.
They need me!

13:31.077 --> 13:33.878
You sure it isn't
the other way around?

13:33.880 --> 13:35.113
Meaning what?

13:35.115 --> 13:36.548
This crowd's got
you brainwashed,

13:36.550 --> 13:38.283
thinking you're
some kind of god.

13:38.285 --> 13:39.884
But it's just to keep you
comfortable enough

13:39.886 --> 13:41.052
so they can take you out.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.854
What are you gonna do?

13:46.892 --> 13:48.893
Kill the puppet master.

13:48.895 --> 13:51.963
When slink is dead,
this party is mine.

13:54.033 --> 13:56.568
I'll own it all.

13:56.570 --> 13:59.137
Arthur, we need
to leave the state.

13:59.139 --> 14:00.572
Hell, we need to leave
the planet!

14:00.574 --> 14:03.842
You always said I need
to collect some more teeth.

14:03.844 --> 14:07.011
How about I bring you
a whole goddamn head?

14:07.013 --> 14:08.913
Get the fuck out of my face.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.350
Slink!

14:12.352 --> 14:14.052
Arthur. Look, it's not safe.

14:14.054 --> 14:16.054
I know it sounds crazy,
but they're trying to kill you.

14:16.056 --> 14:19.390
You're late to the party.
He already knows.

14:20.993 --> 14:22.460
- Stop.
- Not now.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.128
I have to kill slink.

14:24.130 --> 14:25.597
Kill slink?

14:25.599 --> 14:29.067
- Aren't you...
- His partner.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.902
His real partner.

14:32.071 --> 14:34.138
Look, we've beaten
that guy to a pulp.

14:34.140 --> 14:36.040
We stabbed him.
We set him on fire.

14:36.042 --> 14:37.141
He didn't even feel a thing.

14:37.143 --> 14:39.510
I wasn't primo then.

14:39.512 --> 14:41.079
Can I have your autograph?

14:41.081 --> 14:43.514
- The fuck off me.
- Arthur, this is bullshit.

14:43.516 --> 14:46.951
It doesn't mean anything.
It's just a fucking jacket.

14:46.953 --> 14:48.987
Please... let's go.

14:50.055 --> 14:51.623
Get the fuck out of my way.

14:53.092 --> 14:54.626
Slink!

14:54.628 --> 14:58.062
That dickless freak isn't
even human, Arthur.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.964
And he's not an idiot.

14:59.966 --> 15:02.166
Okay, whatever you have planned,

15:02.168 --> 15:03.534
it's not gonna work.

15:03.536 --> 15:05.436
We'll see about that.

15:05.438 --> 15:06.638
Slink, show yourself!

15:06.640 --> 15:08.373
Slink! Slink! Slink!

15:08.375 --> 15:10.041
Slink! Slink! Slink!

15:10.043 --> 15:11.175
Slink! Slink!

15:15.515 --> 15:19.083
Pestilent peons and peddlers
of pain...

15:19.085 --> 15:20.485
Arthur, don't.

15:20.487 --> 15:24.222
Pitiful parasites who
prize the profane...

15:24.224 --> 15:26.557
Pederasts and pansies...

15:26.559 --> 15:28.426
Arthur, this is exactly
what he wants.

15:28.428 --> 15:31.663
- Please welcome your pick...
- It's a trap, goddamn it!

15:31.665 --> 15:36.067
Your prophet, your preacher...

15:36.069 --> 15:38.670
Your prize and your...

15:40.006 --> 15:41.472
Pick.

15:59.224 --> 16:01.492
Primo! Primo! Primo!

16:01.494 --> 16:04.162
Primo! Primo! Primo!

16:04.164 --> 16:07.532
Primo! Primo! Primo! Primo!

16:07.534 --> 16:10.435
Primo! Primo! Primo!

16:10.437 --> 16:13.104
I am primo!

16:20.412 --> 16:22.313
I am but one gear
in the clockwork

16:22.315 --> 16:23.481
that is heart enterprises.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.650
I live only to perform
my function.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.318
If I do not, then we do not.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.687
And if we do not,
then time isn't told

16:29.689 --> 16:31.155
and the world doesn't turn...

16:31.157 --> 16:32.724
big day? You ready?

16:32.726 --> 16:34.425
Why? What did you hear?

16:34.427 --> 16:36.160
Nothing. Nothing at all.

16:36.162 --> 16:37.428
Just asking if you're ready.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.664
I'm ready. I'm gonna kill it.

16:45.738 --> 16:47.305
For three months and 18 days,

16:47.307 --> 16:48.740
I've worked here
at heart enterprises.

16:48.742 --> 16:50.408
For the three months
and 18 days,

16:50.410 --> 16:51.743
I haven't had a single stab

16:51.745 --> 16:53.511
at getting revenge on grace.

16:53.513 --> 16:56.014
But all that changes today,
because a junior executive spot

16:56.016 --> 16:57.749
just opened up on the board,

16:57.751 --> 17:00.451
and if I get it, I'll finally
have control over...

17:04.290 --> 17:05.623
Garrett kemble?

17:05.625 --> 17:07.791
- What's up, Kay bae?
- What are you doing here?

17:07.794 --> 17:11.462
The boys just offered me
the open spot on the board.

17:12.598 --> 17:14.398
What?

17:14.401 --> 17:15.800
No, you weren't...

17:15.801 --> 17:20.038
You didn't think you
had a chance, did you?

17:20.040 --> 17:21.571
Awww.

17:21.574 --> 17:24.742
I'm sorry, sweetheart,
but pink Polish don't belong

17:24.743 --> 17:26.210
in the boardroom.

17:26.212 --> 17:27.578
Boop.

18:23.335 --> 18:25.536
I've always wanted
a bespoke suit.

18:33.746 --> 18:34.745
Yeah! Yeah!

18:34.747 --> 18:37.381
Whoa.

18:37.383 --> 18:39.350
You actually did it.

18:40.385 --> 18:41.652
You killed slink.

18:41.654 --> 18:43.688
Shit yeah, I did.

18:43.690 --> 18:44.889
Now's our chance.

18:44.891 --> 18:46.557
Let's get the hell out of here.
Come on!

18:46.559 --> 18:47.558
Hold on.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.694
Slink's just the beginning.

18:49.696 --> 18:49.694
If heart wants you dead,

18:49.696 --> 18:52.697
then we need to bring
the fight to them.

18:52.699 --> 18:53.731
I just came from heart.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.399
Trust me, you can't beat them.

18:55.401 --> 18:56.601
We need to get in the car

18:56.603 --> 18:58.436
and disappear before
it's too late.

18:58.438 --> 18:58.436
Running doesn't solve anything.

18:58.438 --> 19:02.640
And how many more innocent
people do they have to corrupt?

19:04.510 --> 19:05.810
You're primo now.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.712
Great. Whoopdefuckin'-do.

19:07.714 --> 19:10.815
But who I need right now
is that guy.

19:10.817 --> 19:13.818
The guy who fell on my Camaro
and changed everything.

19:18.925 --> 19:21.592
Okay, so how about this?

19:21.594 --> 19:23.561
Come with me so we can get
revenge on the fuckers

19:23.563 --> 19:26.731
who tried to kill the primo.

19:26.733 --> 19:28.933
Doesn't matter which
side you land on.

19:28.935 --> 19:31.369
We can't let heart survive this.

19:34.741 --> 19:36.374
Are you with me?

19:45.485 --> 19:46.851
Her plan is insane.

19:46.853 --> 19:47.952
In. Sane.

19:47.954 --> 19:49.820
You haven't been to heart.
I have.

19:49.822 --> 19:51.889
And believe me, you don't want
to be anywhere near that place.

19:51.891 --> 19:54.559
Which is exactly why we
have to destroy it.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.494
Dude, you just met this chick.

19:56.496 --> 19:57.562
She's got you all twisted up.
'Scuse me?

19:57.564 --> 19:58.763
Listen to me, your partner...

19:58.765 --> 20:00.565
The guy who's been by
your side for years.

20:00.567 --> 20:01.866
I'm trying to save your ass.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.834
Fuck you, spare parts.

20:03.836 --> 20:05.803
You don't even know me.

20:16.848 --> 20:18.649
You can't listen to her.

20:18.651 --> 20:21.452
You better back off, or you're
gonna end up with matching eyes.

20:21.454 --> 20:22.987
All right, enough!

20:22.989 --> 20:25.790
Both of you are giving me
a fuckin' headache.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.658
If I hadn't gotten
into the Camaro,

20:27.660 --> 20:29.627
I wouldn't be primo.

20:29.629 --> 20:31.862
- I owe the chick.
- The chick?

20:31.864 --> 20:36.467
You know that happy life
you always wanted with me?

20:36.469 --> 20:39.904
Now's the chance to make
that your reality.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.472
Forget heart.

20:41.474 --> 20:43.841
Be my queen and rule
this wasteland with me

20:43.843 --> 20:46.410
as primo royalty.

20:46.412 --> 20:49.480
You can be my queen bee

20:49.482 --> 20:52.917
in a harem of...

20:52.919 --> 20:54.952
Other bees.

20:54.954 --> 20:57.989
Are you crazy, Arthur?

20:57.991 --> 20:59.624
Am I crazy?

20:59.626 --> 21:01.792
Every girl on earth would
kill for that offer.

21:04.964 --> 21:07.732
You know what? Fuck you.

21:07.734 --> 21:08.866
And fuck you, too.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.434
Dude!

21:10.436 --> 21:12.837
X marks the spot!

21:12.839 --> 21:14.705
Arthur!

21:22.048 --> 21:25.483
Did you really think

21:25.485 --> 21:26.884
you'd be the first primo

21:26.886 --> 21:28.953
to try and save his own skin

21:28.955 --> 21:30.521
by killing me?

21:32.958 --> 21:34.959
Please!

21:47.539 --> 21:51.776
Every primo thinks
that he's special...

21:51.778 --> 21:55.980
That he'll be the first
to break the mold

21:55.982 --> 21:58.883
and live on.

21:58.885 --> 22:00.885
Go on. Move.

22:00.887 --> 22:05.656
And just like all
the other pathetic saps,

22:05.658 --> 22:07.892
the signs were in front of you

22:07.894 --> 22:10.928
the whole time.

22:10.930 --> 22:13.030
The tribute...

22:13.032 --> 22:16.100
The tribute is a sacrifice.

22:16.102 --> 22:19.837
We didn't even have to hide it.

22:19.839 --> 22:21.539
You...

22:21.541 --> 22:24.775
Blinded yourself with pride.

22:24.777 --> 22:27.111
You see...

22:27.113 --> 22:29.013
The truth is,

22:29.015 --> 22:35.019
in this dark and disgusting
depraved world,

22:35.021 --> 22:36.987
no one's special.

22:38.557 --> 22:40.057
No one survives.

22:40.059 --> 22:41.926
No one leaves a legacy.

22:45.030 --> 22:46.130
Not even you.

22:47.734 --> 22:50.935
Let the primo sacrifice...

22:50.937 --> 22:52.903
Begin!

22:55.775 --> 22:58.876
Primo! Primo! Primo! Primo!

22:58.878 --> 23:01.712
Primo! Primo! Primo!

23:01.714 --> 23:05.015
Primo! Primo! Primo! Primo!

23:16.662 --> 23:19.430
Please don't kill me.
Please don't kill me!

23:23.536 --> 23:26.570
Say it in French.

23:26.572 --> 23:27.571
What?

23:27.573 --> 23:29.673
Say it in French!

23:32.478 --> 23:35.646
Please don't kill me.

23:37.716 --> 23:41.118
That never gets old.

23:42.688 --> 23:44.688
Here's what's gonna happen.

23:46.525 --> 23:48.559
You work for me now.

23:49.728 --> 23:51.729
First order of business...

23:53.765 --> 23:55.666
We need new board members.

23:57.702 --> 24:00.171
Second order of business...

24:01.506 --> 24:04.175
Get me up to speed
on the blood drive.

24:20.625 --> 24:24.195
Those morons have a knack
for overlooking potential.

24:24.197 --> 24:25.763
It's so weird.

24:25.765 --> 24:27.198
People take you way more serious

24:27.200 --> 24:29.867
when you have facial hair
and pee standing up.

24:42.647 --> 24:44.148
You really think
that's gonna work?

24:44.150 --> 24:45.649
It did before.

24:47.519 --> 24:49.887
From his pathetic beginnings

24:49.889 --> 24:52.156
on the streets of la,

24:52.158 --> 24:55.593
we witnessed the world's
last "good cop"

24:55.595 --> 24:59.663
descend deliciously
into darkness.

25:02.835 --> 25:05.169
But today, he emerges
a champion.

25:10.075 --> 25:12.543
Our greatest hero:

25:12.545 --> 25:14.278
The primo!

25:15.882 --> 25:17.615
You don't care about Arthur.

25:17.617 --> 25:19.283
I think you wanted
this all along.

25:19.285 --> 25:20.851
I think you set him up.

25:20.853 --> 25:22.553
You think I want Arthur dead?

25:22.555 --> 25:24.121
Why the hell would I want that?

25:24.123 --> 25:26.757
Maybe because you want
to be the primo.

25:26.759 --> 25:30.294
I want to be the primo as much
as I want a root canal.

25:30.296 --> 25:33.163
I don't give a shit about
being the primo... never did.

25:33.165 --> 25:36.834
I get that you two have
a long history together.

25:36.836 --> 25:38.702
And I respect that.

25:38.704 --> 25:41.839
But please get it through
your meathead skull:

25:41.841 --> 25:43.140
I care about him, too.

25:43.142 --> 25:45.543
And I'm not the problem here.

25:45.545 --> 25:47.912
This is the fucking problem!

25:47.914 --> 25:49.813
Say I believe you.

25:51.851 --> 25:53.317
We need to think of a plan.

26:02.327 --> 26:04.261
Whoa! I got a girlfriend.

26:04.263 --> 26:05.763
I thought you and Arthur...

26:05.765 --> 26:07.798
just pee on it, you moron.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.333
We can use it to bend the bars.

26:09.335 --> 26:13.704
Today, we honor him
with this tribute!

26:26.318 --> 26:27.985
I don't mind the eye contact.

26:27.987 --> 26:29.153
Yeah, you wouldn't.

26:29.155 --> 26:32.756
In return, he gives us...

26:32.758 --> 26:35.159
The ultimate gift:

26:35.161 --> 26:36.760
His body.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.634
His blood!

26:45.971 --> 26:47.871
And his soul!

27:06.324 --> 27:08.225
All right, robocop.

27:08.227 --> 27:09.793
I'm gonna buy you some time

27:09.795 --> 27:11.795
so you can go rescue Arthur
from that meat grinder

27:11.797 --> 27:13.030
while I distract slink.

27:15.901 --> 27:17.034
All right.

27:17.036 --> 27:18.335
Let's go get our boy back.

27:18.337 --> 27:20.204
No flash photography
of any kind.

27:20.206 --> 27:23.674
Turn off your cell phones,
keep your feet off the seats,

27:23.676 --> 27:27.244
and get ready...

27:27.246 --> 27:29.747
To enjoy...

27:31.850 --> 27:34.385
The show.

27:34.387 --> 27:38.789
Now, my handsome
little imbecile...

27:38.859 --> 27:39.758
Any last words?

27:39.759 --> 27:43.827
I'm gonna skin you alive
and wear you for Halloween.

27:45.898 --> 27:47.364
What I meant was,

27:47.366 --> 27:50.701
those were your last words.

27:50.703 --> 27:52.436
Send him off!

27:52.438 --> 27:54.972
Byebye!

27:54.974 --> 27:57.374
You enjoy your trip, now.

27:57.376 --> 27:59.843
In case of a water landing,

27:59.845 --> 28:01.979
put your head between your legs

28:01.981 --> 28:05.282
and kiss your ass goodbye!

28:09.688 --> 28:11.288
All right, you get out there.

28:11.290 --> 28:12.823
I'll take care of slink.

28:21.866 --> 28:24.768
Slink.

28:24.770 --> 28:27.905
You don't really
want to do this.

28:27.907 --> 28:29.039
Think about it.

28:29.041 --> 28:31.008
Arthur's worth way more

28:31.010 --> 28:32.276
alive than dead to you.

28:32.278 --> 28:33.444
Go on.

28:33.446 --> 28:36.313
Well, if you kill him now,

28:36.315 --> 28:40.417
you put on, what,
one good spectacle?

28:40.419 --> 28:43.954
But everyone here's already
expecting him to die.

28:43.956 --> 28:45.856
Subvert their expectations.

28:45.858 --> 28:47.958
Surprise them.

28:47.960 --> 28:50.394
Dazzle them.

28:50.396 --> 28:52.362
I'm listening.

28:54.934 --> 28:56.867
Nobody grinds that ass but me.

28:59.337 --> 29:02.740
On the other hand,
if the primo lives,

29:02.742 --> 29:05.776
you can continue
the blood drive.

29:05.778 --> 29:08.011
Think of how far you
could take that.

29:12.917 --> 29:14.918
Stand aside.
We both know I'm not.

29:14.920 --> 29:17.387
He's going into that
soul reclamator.

29:17.389 --> 29:20.891
But... he doesn't have to die.

29:20.893 --> 29:20.891
Come again, say what?

29:20.893 --> 29:24.394
The soul reclamator!
It processes souls.

29:24.396 --> 29:26.130
Turns it into icky green goo

29:26.132 --> 29:27.931
that holds ten times,

29:27.933 --> 29:31.468
100 times the energy potential
of boring old blood.

29:31.470 --> 29:33.771
Kind of like the engine
in your Camaro.

29:33.773 --> 29:36.373
Works the same way,
just not as well.

29:36.375 --> 29:39.042
That's so interesting.

29:40.345 --> 29:43.914
Thank you for mansplaining
that to me.

29:45.416 --> 29:47.084
What the fuck does that
have to do with Arthur?

29:47.086 --> 29:50.420
Well, if our boy has in fact
become a true primo

29:50.422 --> 29:52.823
and purged his soul,

29:52.825 --> 29:54.525
there'll be no soul
to reclamate.

29:54.527 --> 29:56.493
He'll simply tumble
right through

29:56.495 --> 29:59.062
and land on the other side
without a scratch.

30:02.002 --> 30:02.901
Either he dies,

30:02.902 --> 30:08.038
or becomes a soulless monster
who'll never love you.

30:10.575 --> 30:12.843
No matter how you
slice it, I win.

30:14.412 --> 30:17.047
You really are a piece of shit.

30:17.049 --> 30:18.982
I know!

30:31.997 --> 30:33.597
You all right?

30:35.133 --> 30:36.967
That bastard's gonna pay.

30:36.969 --> 30:38.502
Arthur, it's over.

30:38.504 --> 30:39.970
They're never gonna stop.

30:39.972 --> 30:39.970
We have to get out of here

30:39.972 --> 30:43.473
before the two of them
can kill you.

30:43.475 --> 30:45.075
The two of them?

30:47.612 --> 30:49.513
She's been working with him
this whole time.

30:49.515 --> 30:51.548
Probably since day one.

30:51.550 --> 30:53.083
I know you like her.

30:53.085 --> 30:56.019
But it doesn't change the fact
that she betrayed you.

30:57.889 --> 30:59.223
That doesn't make any sense.

30:59.225 --> 31:00.557
I'll prove it to you.

31:00.559 --> 31:02.492
This eye records
everything I see.

31:04.195 --> 31:05.896
<i>You think I want arth...</i>

31:05.898 --> 31:08.265
<i>I want Arthur to die.
I want Arthur to die.</i>

31:08.267 --> 31:09.933
<i>I want to be primo as much...</i>

31:09.935 --> 31:12.903
<i>I want to be primo.
I want to be primo.</i>

31:18.143 --> 31:20.444
There's only one primo.

31:20.446 --> 31:22.880
Let's make sure
it stays that way.

31:29.320 --> 31:30.921
It doesn't have to be
this way, slink.

31:30.923 --> 31:33.924
Grace!

31:35.327 --> 31:36.660
What the hell are you doing?

31:36.662 --> 31:38.629
No one treats me like this.

31:38.631 --> 31:41.465
No one!

31:41.467 --> 31:43.200
Christopher!

31:45.136 --> 31:47.170
A little help!

31:47.172 --> 31:48.472
Help you what?

31:48.474 --> 31:49.606
Usurp the primo?

31:49.608 --> 31:51.174
Not a chance in hell.

31:51.176 --> 31:52.476
Finish her, Arthur!

31:54.679 --> 31:56.446
Don't do this, Arthur.

31:56.448 --> 31:59.316
Call me primo.

31:59.318 --> 32:00.550
Argh!

32:02.354 --> 32:04.321
Betrayal? Dramatic irony?

32:04.323 --> 32:06.323
How gloriously unexpected!

32:08.293 --> 32:10.294
This is the stage!
This is the stage!

32:10.296 --> 32:12.262
Give a wide berth!
Nobody on or off!

32:12.264 --> 32:13.463
Nobody on or off!

32:16.701 --> 32:18.969
I want multiple angles.

32:18.971 --> 32:20.671
You, you!

32:20.673 --> 32:22.940
Get me close on the primo.
Close on the primo.

32:22.942 --> 32:24.541
You! Twoshot!

32:24.543 --> 32:26.276
Get me a twoshot!

32:32.317 --> 32:34.584
Tracking! Track!
Between the legs!

32:45.331 --> 32:48.532
Thank god for improvisation.

33:18.630 --> 33:20.530
I won't beg.

33:23.435 --> 33:25.335
I won't make you.

33:29.041 --> 33:30.774
It's over.

33:34.078 --> 33:36.747
I agree.

33:44.322 --> 33:46.056
You can kill me if you want to.

33:46.058 --> 33:48.325
But I know who you
really are, Arthur.

33:49.527 --> 33:51.328
You used to stand for something.

33:51.330 --> 33:54.664
And all that shit
we went through...

33:54.666 --> 33:56.333
It was for a reason.

33:56.335 --> 33:59.302
It was the make the world
a better place.

33:59.304 --> 34:01.705
This fucking race...

34:01.707 --> 34:03.673
It got us off track.

34:03.675 --> 34:05.776
You're not bad.

34:05.778 --> 34:08.078
You're Arthur Bailey.

34:08.080 --> 34:11.114
Fight for that, 'cause that's
worth fighting for.

34:17.790 --> 34:20.657
Why won't you do it?

34:20.659 --> 34:22.626
Finish her!

34:25.797 --> 34:27.464
Don't be a pussy.

34:28.666 --> 34:30.801
You weak fuck. You know what?

34:30.803 --> 34:33.804
Cut your own balls off,
while you're at it.

34:33.806 --> 34:35.472
You were a shitty cop.

34:35.474 --> 34:37.706
And you're an even
shittier primo.

34:37.708 --> 34:39.376
Now do it!

34:54.326 --> 34:55.692
Tell me you got that.

35:12.643 --> 35:14.377
Julian slink here.

35:14.379 --> 35:15.812
You're canceled.

35:17.815 --> 35:19.616
<i>And I'm done with you.</i>

35:32.196 --> 35:35.632
I... Was your friend.

35:46.511 --> 35:49.479
I... was your friend.

35:49.481 --> 35:51.848
I... was your friend.

35:56.521 --> 35:58.555
The fuck is that thing?

35:59.657 --> 36:01.892
How did you know
it wasn't Christopher?

36:01.894 --> 36:03.660
I didn't.

36:11.869 --> 36:13.503
I wanted to believe

36:13.505 --> 36:15.238
the things he was telling me.

36:15.240 --> 36:17.641
I wanted to believe
I was primo...

36:20.312 --> 36:21.611
That I was a god.

36:26.185 --> 36:27.584
That terrifies me.

36:31.223 --> 36:33.823
Arthur?

36:33.825 --> 36:36.293
I almost killed you.

36:38.362 --> 36:42.966
You're the only person in
the world I can trust.

36:42.968 --> 36:44.868
The person I've
fallen in love with.

37:11.229 --> 37:13.296
What about the primo?

37:17.502 --> 37:21.338
This got me to the place that
I could kill my best friend.

37:21.340 --> 37:23.540
No, the jacket's just a symbol.

37:25.376 --> 37:27.677
That wasn't you.

37:27.679 --> 37:29.579
That was heart.

37:29.581 --> 37:30.981
This...

37:30.983 --> 37:34.351
This just means whatever
you want it to mean.

37:42.727 --> 37:44.361
I can live with that.

38:07.718 --> 38:09.419
So can I.

38:15.394 --> 38:17.294
Get the fuck out of my car.

38:17.296 --> 38:19.562
You've been lying to us
this whole fuckin' time.

38:19.564 --> 38:21.498
Yes, but... yes.

38:21.500 --> 38:23.533
You spent all day
trying to kill Arthur.

38:23.535 --> 38:25.935
- Indeed.
- And you sent Christopher

38:25.937 --> 38:27.037
to convince me to kill grace.

38:27.039 --> 38:28.672
<i>Au contraire.</i>

38:28.674 --> 38:31.007
No, that... although it was fun
to watch... that wasn't me.

38:31.009 --> 38:32.742
Look, here's the deal.

38:32.744 --> 38:35.512
I'm done with their
fuckin' notes, all right?

38:35.514 --> 38:37.514
It's time to put these
assholes out of business.

38:37.516 --> 38:38.648
You wanna, I wanna.

38:38.650 --> 38:40.583
What do you say we partner up?

38:40.585 --> 38:43.753
You want to help us
destroy the company

38:43.755 --> 38:46.323
that helps make your show?

38:46.325 --> 38:47.557
My show's finished.

38:47.559 --> 38:50.960
I'm done with their chain
around my neck.

38:50.962 --> 38:53.029
Time for the wrap party, and...

38:54.398 --> 38:56.433
It's gonna be a blast.

38:58.069 --> 39:00.537
Got the idea from
the gentlemen's little escapade,

39:00.539 --> 39:02.439
so I rounded up
these little puppies

39:02.441 --> 39:04.774
for just such an emergency.

39:04.776 --> 39:06.042
Which is?

39:06.044 --> 39:07.577
We're a day's drive away

39:07.579 --> 39:09.446
from their headquarters
at heart tower.

39:09.448 --> 39:11.715
There's enough boom in this bag

39:11.717 --> 39:15.685
to bring that company down
forever.

39:18.389 --> 39:20.457
I'll even let you drive.

39:24.463 --> 39:27.530
He's only fucked us over,
I don't know,

39:27.532 --> 39:30.400
every single time.

39:30.402 --> 39:34.571
And we've survived,
every single time.

39:36.407 --> 39:40.410
We've been through way too much
to let them win.

39:40.412 --> 39:42.545
First Karma, now Christopher?

39:42.547 --> 39:45.482
Let's put those bastards
six feet under.

39:51.490 --> 39:52.722
Every last one.

39:54.492 --> 39:57.427
There's one thing
that still bothers me.

39:57.429 --> 39:59.729
Who did that to Christopher?

40:17.848 --> 40:21.751
I feel something. I feel...

40:21.753 --> 40:22.886
Hopelessness.

40:30.761 --> 40:32.195
Do your worst, bitch.

40:32.197 --> 40:33.863
Is that any way to speak
to the only person

40:33.865 --> 40:35.665
who knows you're still alive?

40:35.667 --> 40:37.834
Person?

40:37.836 --> 40:39.736
You don't even qualify.

40:39.738 --> 40:41.204
Just a warning:

40:41.206 --> 40:44.073
This might sting a little.

40:44.075 --> 40:47.544
<i>I... was your friend.</i>

40:54.819 --> 40:56.186
<i>I... was your...</i>

40:56.188 --> 40:57.754
when I found out this aki unit

40:57.756 --> 41:01.124
had Arthur Bailey's partner
hidden away down here,

41:01.126 --> 41:03.793
I almost had her
body dismantled.

41:03.795 --> 41:05.829
<i>- Friend...</i>
<i>- </i> But...

41:05.831 --> 41:07.764
This little collection of hers,

41:07.766 --> 41:10.133
it really came in handy.

41:13.772 --> 41:15.171
Gross.

41:15.173 --> 41:16.840
I built a new you

41:16.842 --> 41:19.709
to send to fuck with my sister.

41:19.711 --> 41:21.644
But it failed.

41:21.646 --> 41:24.180
So, what are you
gonna do about it?

41:24.182 --> 41:26.683
<i>- Friend...</i>
- How do you turn it off?

41:26.685 --> 41:28.718
You know, I could always
send another copy of you

41:28.720 --> 41:30.186
to try again.

41:31.589 --> 41:33.756
But wouldn't it feel good...

41:35.192 --> 41:37.861
To have his thick neck
between your hands?

41:37.863 --> 41:40.663
Turn it off.

41:43.668 --> 41:44.834
Turn it off!

41:50.742 --> 41:53.142
The list of upgrades.

41:53.144 --> 41:54.611
Christopher, think of what...

41:54.613 --> 41:55.745
do it!

42:11.795 --> 42:13.830
Give me <i> all</i> the mods.
