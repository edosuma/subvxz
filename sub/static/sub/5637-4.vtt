00:04.738 --> 00:10.642
"survivor," after a surprise
switch, drop your buff,

00:10.644 --> 00:13.045
"survivor" second chance went
from two tribes to three tribes.

00:13.047 --> 00:15.914
The new ta keo tried was
building confidence.

00:15.916 --> 00:21.820
>> we have four number-one draft
picks.

00:21.822 --> 00:25.557
>> jeff: The new bayon tribe
was building relationships.

00:25.559 --> 00:29.395
>> I'm trying something new.
I'm trying to have feelings.

00:29.397 --> 00:37.803
>> jeff: While the new andara
tribe had two in the minority.

00:37.805 --> 00:40.406
>> when we come back together,
you can join up.

00:40.408 --> 00:44.209
>> my old members want to be ta
keo strong.

00:44.211 --> 00:47.846
Tasha is whispering sweet
nothings in my ear.

00:47.848 --> 00:56.288
>> jeff: At the immunity idol,
jeremy secretly found an idol.

00:56.290 --> 00:59.058
Ankor went the tribal council.
>> I made a deal with you and he

00:59.060 --> 01:03.062
Made a deal with her.
>> I'm in the middle of a big

01:03.064 --> 01:05.664
Ole mess.
I shouldn't have done that.

01:05.666 --> 01:08.167
>> jeff: Facing tribal
council, the former ta keo

01:08.169 --> 01:10.669
Couldn't get along.
>> I know I'm on the bottom with

01:10.671 --> 01:14.106
You guys, so I'm going to vote
with them.

01:14.108 --> 01:16.975
>> jeff: So tasha and savage
used it to their advantage.

01:16.977 --> 01:20.612
>> you vote tasha and I'll vote
peih-gee.

01:20.614 --> 01:23.482
>> we were down.
>> jeff: At tribal council,

01:23.484 --> 01:28.854
Woo voted for abi again.
Third person voted out of

01:28.856 --> 01:33.492
"survivor" second chance.
But it was peih-gee who was sent

01:33.494 --> 01:34.760
Home.
>> good luck.

01:34.762 --> 01:38.263
>> jeff: The tribe has spoken.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.785
>> I can't believe I'm here.
I dodged a bullet.

01:59.787 --> 02:05.357
I came back from that challenge
thinking I was gone.

02:05.359 --> 02:07.960
But I did not get one single
vote.

02:07.962 --> 02:09.527
>> thank you.
I'm grateful.

02:09.530 --> 02:12.965
I just want you guys to know I'm
loyal.

02:12.967 --> 02:16.235
I've always been loyal to abi.
I want you guys to tell me what

02:16.237 --> 02:17.903
I need to do to move myself to
you.

02:17.905 --> 02:22.174
>> I am endebted to these people
now, which makes me sick.

02:22.176 --> 02:26.712
I have to kiss their asses, but
this is my second chance.

02:26.714 --> 02:28.914
I'm going to do what I have to
do.

02:28.916 --> 02:36.922
>> honestly, peih-gee should not
have gone home.

02:36.924 --> 02:38.690
But the challenge was the worst
thing ever.

02:38.692 --> 02:42.461
He's a sneak.
It should have been him.

02:42.463 --> 02:46.064
>> I'm feeling great because I
came in here bottom two.

02:46.066 --> 02:49.368
And I initially thought that it
would be either savage of myself

02:49.370 --> 02:53.105
Going home.
But now we're in control.

02:53.107 --> 02:56.742
>> he's the source of all the
contention and all the problems.

02:56.744 --> 03:01.813
>> I agree.
>> so I'm just saying, you are

03:01.815 --> 03:07.819
Not going anywhere.
You're not.

03:07.821 --> 03:10.989
>> tasha, I'm really
uncomfortable with what just

03:10.991 --> 03:13.392
Happened.
>> we'll talk about it.

03:13.394 --> 03:16.528
>> I don't want to talk about
it.

03:16.530 --> 03:20.098
I have a problem when you take
someone that just voted me aside

03:20.100 --> 03:23.268
And have a conversation.
>> abi, I didn't lie to you.

03:23.270 --> 03:26.572
I didn't blind side you.
I had your back.

03:26.574 --> 03:30.409
So what's the beef?
>> aligning with abi does make

03:30.411 --> 03:34.046
Me a little nervous because she
has deep-rooted insecurities.

03:34.048 --> 03:39.318
She has some paranoia, which
makes her completely

03:39.320 --> 03:42.621
Unpredictable.
>> we've been scheming on

03:42.623 --> 03:46.158
Getting me out a long time ago.
It bothers me to get these votes

03:46.160 --> 03:50.128
At tribal, especially when
you're coming from a tribe like

03:50.130 --> 03:56.735
Ta keo where everyone is
plotting to get you out.

03:56.737 --> 03:59.538
For me it's starting to come off
as personal.

03:59.540 --> 04:04.343
I feel great that I am in the
majority, but I have my ears

04:04.345 --> 04:07.512
Open, and woo has voted for me
twice.

04:07.514 --> 04:10.782
And if the decision was up to
me, he's going to be the next

04:10.784 --> 04:27.232
One going home.

04:31.404 --> 04:35.807
>> in the last immunity
challenge, I found the hidden

04:35.809 --> 04:38.910
Immunity I doll.
I got it, and I'm like, I'm so

04:38.912 --> 04:41.813
Happy.
It took two years to get this

04:41.815 --> 04:43.415
Thing, but I finally got my
idol.

04:43.417 --> 04:46.051
It's a thing of beauty.
It's a thing of beauty.

04:46.053 --> 04:49.421
I love it.
I love it.

04:49.423 --> 04:53.258
>> any luck with the idol?
>> no.

04:53.260 --> 04:55.661
I think about mike last season
in the tree.

04:55.663 --> 04:58.297
I want the climb a tree and
look, you know what I mean?

04:58.299 --> 05:01.967
>> I hear you, but how would you
even know what tree top it could

05:01.969 --> 05:03.935
Be in?
>> this is my idol.

05:03.937 --> 05:07.372
I'm not telling anybody.
So I told steven that we got to

05:07.374 --> 05:09.274
Really look for this thing
because I don't need him to

05:09.276 --> 05:11.743
Think that I have it.
>> what we can do is we can

05:11.745 --> 05:13.979
Start here.
You go that way, I'll go that

05:13.981 --> 05:17.082
Way, and we'll just hit it hard.
We got to find this thing.

05:17.084 --> 05:19.451
It's out here.
It's out here.

05:19.453 --> 05:22.254
I want steven to think that I'm
still looking for it and it's

05:22.256 --> 05:24.489
For us.
I want the keep pulling him

05:24.491 --> 05:26.792
Close.
I know they're going to come

05:26.794 --> 05:30.696
After me at some point, and I
want him to be the one to say,

05:30.698 --> 05:34.533
Listen, they're coming after
you, and I got my get out of

05:34.535 --> 05:37.569
Jail free card.
I would love to be friends with

05:37.571 --> 05:41.073
Steve for life after this.
I'll give him second place, if

05:41.075 --> 05:43.075
You're happy with that.
I'm in the happy with second

05:43.077 --> 05:45.844
Place.

06:18.878 --> 06:19.811
>> we survived the night in this
hellhole.

06:19.813 --> 06:21.880
Pretty good, right?
This is a dead cove.

06:21.882 --> 06:30.322
>> I know.
This is dead.

06:30.324 --> 06:34.659
>> our new camp, no resource, no
shelter, nothing.

06:34.661 --> 06:38.263
>> wish me luck.
>> I'm gutted.

06:38.265 --> 06:40.632
I started out with the
shangri-la.

06:40.634 --> 06:43.602
I was top dog with an abundance
of seafood.

06:43.604 --> 06:47.472
Now I am in literally a
"survivor" ghetto.

06:47.474 --> 06:49.307
There's nothing here.
>> welcome back.

06:49.309 --> 06:52.611
>> I wish I had better news.
This is really, really

06:52.613 --> 06:56.314
Difficult.
It's not like we're kicking back

06:56.316 --> 07:02.654
And just having someone feed us
and we're sleeping in hammocks.

07:02.656 --> 07:04.122
I mean, we are in hell right
now.

07:04.124 --> 07:08.293
>> you all hungry?
>> starving.

07:08.295 --> 07:09.695
Why?
What is it?

07:09.696 --> 07:11.096
>> just another day at the
beach.

07:11.098 --> 07:15.200
Getting wet and stomping about.
Who will win is up in the air,

07:15.202 --> 07:20.405
Some will feast and some will
pout.

07:20.407 --> 07:23.175
>> feast.
>> a rechallenge, which is

07:23.177 --> 07:26.511
Great, because I'm starting to
feel like I'm kind of withering

07:26.513 --> 07:29.080
Away.
So I'm really excited, but I

07:29.082 --> 07:31.817
Just don't know how much we have
in our tank to actually pull

07:31.819 --> 07:42.394
This off.

07:51.804 --> 08:04.382
>> jeff: Come on in, guys.
Bayon, ta keo getting your first

08:04.384 --> 08:08.587

You're going to race out in the
water, retrieve a sandbag and

08:19.466 --> 08:23.134
Race back.
You'll then use a plank to

08:46.360 --> 08:52.898
Just as fun.
Last to finish, nothing.

08:52.900 --> 08:55.000
Worth playing for?
>> worth playing for.

08:55.002 --> 08:59.204

Each tribe will select one

08:59.206 --> 09:00.572
Person to run the entire
challenge.

09:00.574 --> 09:03.375
This is a hero challenge.
You're going to put all your

Eggs in one basket.

Get it up in the air and drop it
in that net.

10:24.024 --> 10:28.827
It is adjustable.
This will take some

10:28.829 --> 10:33.565
Experimenting.
Dietz scores his first one.

10:33.567 --> 10:40.472
Dietz heads back out for ta keo.

13:42.889 --> 13:45.657
You got it.
>> come on, jeremy.

13:45.659 --> 13:49.561
>> jeff: Dietz launches and
scores.

13:49.563 --> 14:01.873
Ta keo wins reward.
Nothing for the bayon tribe.

14:01.875 --> 14:05.977
Angkor, how big is this victory?
>> we haven't really eaten in

14:05.979 --> 14:14.052
Four days, and andrew did that
just on pure love for this

14:14.054 --> 14:16.187
Tribe.
>> jeff: Angkor, nice reward.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.623
Everything you need to have a
great barbecue back at camp,

14:18.625 --> 14:22.227
Grab your stuff, enjoy your
campfire.

14:22.229 --> 14:27.832
>> good job, guys.
Good job, andrew.

14:27.834 --> 14:30.535
>> jeff: Ta keo, not a full
barbecue set, but it's in the

14:30.537 --> 14:32.470
Bad.
Come grab your reward.

14:32.472 --> 14:38.877
Head back to camp.
Bayon, got nothing for you.

14:38.879 --> 14:40.411
Grab your stuff, head back to
camp.

14:40.413 --> 14:46.017
>> part of my demons, I've never
stopped thinking, did I carry my

14:46.019 --> 14:49.587
Weight, did I do enough to get
us over the hump.

14:49.589 --> 14:51.956
And today I gave it everything I
had and we won.

14:51.958 --> 14:54.926
So vindication for me?
Absolutely.

15:06.238 --> 15:07.872
>> oh, my god, we're going to
eat.

15:07.874 --> 15:10.174
God bless savage.
You're freaking legend.

15:10.176 --> 15:14.445
>> thank you, savage.
>> you're legend, brother.

15:14.447 --> 15:19.817
>> not eating really for four
days, you get at wit's end, so

15:19.819 --> 15:23.421
When jeff said angkor win, I
almost dropped to my knees.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.957
That's one of the best moments
in "survivor" I ever had.

15:25.959 --> 15:29.027
>> I can't believe I'm about to
sit down and dine with you guys.

15:29.029 --> 15:31.095
>> this is like major motivation
for us.

15:31.097 --> 15:34.365
>> they put a million pounds of
faith in me, because this is

15:34.367 --> 15:37.535
Everything when you're starving,
and I was able to deliver.

15:37.537 --> 15:40.271
>> I have grease running down my
fingers.

15:40.273 --> 15:43.875
>> we're so winning immunity.
>> this little tribe, now they

15:43.877 --> 15:46.945
Know we can compete against all
those big horses on the other

15:46.947 --> 15:50.381
Tribes, and that's huge.
That's a game changer, because

15:50.383 --> 15:55.687
Now I think we can fire on all
cylinders and just not go to

15:55.689 --> 16:11.035
Tribal.
Angkor!

16:22.047 --> 16:26.551
>> I think if you lost
"survivor" your first time out,

16:26.553 --> 16:27.852
You need to do something
differently.

16:27.854 --> 16:31.656
I made a big mistake last time.
Strategically I think I played a

16:31.658 --> 16:35.860
Great game.
Socially I didn't.

16:35.862 --> 16:38.529
Pretty much everyone thought I
was going to come in here and be

16:38.531 --> 16:42.066
A little turd and cause them
problems, and probably I was at

16:42.068 --> 16:45.570
The top of the list of everyone
to get out, and I really took

16:45.572 --> 16:50.908
That to heart.
So I read the book "how the win

16:50.910 --> 16:56.114
Friends and influence people."
it says act as sincere as you

16:56.116 --> 16:58.649
Can, sympathize with people.
I know this is bizarre for

16:58.651 --> 17:02.453
People to see chaos kass out
here applying self-help methods,

17:02.455 --> 17:06.324
But I knew I needed to look at
my game play and what I needed

17:06.326 --> 17:13.164
To do.
>> wake up.

17:13.165 --> 17:21.271
I see kass over by the tree, and
she's using the machete to cut

17:21.273 --> 17:23.574
Things.
I'm like, what is this woman

17:23.576 --> 17:25.343
Doing.
I don't trust her.

17:25.345 --> 17:27.645
She nicknamed chaos kass.
Hello.

17:27.646 --> 17:31.482
That's her whole thing to, do
something sneaky, making a fake

17:31.484 --> 17:40.892
Immunity idol.
Then I see her out on the beach.

17:40.894 --> 17:44.562
She's like, get away, get away.
So I know she has stuff up her

17:44.564 --> 17:46.931
Sleeve.
She's chaos kass.

17:46.933 --> 17:49.967
Come on.
>> happy belated birthday.

17:49.969 --> 17:56.174
A little piece of bayon.
A little good luck charm.

17:56.176 --> 17:58.443
>> thank you.
>> cute.

17:58.445 --> 18:00.912
>> I thought you were making
fake idols.

18:00.914 --> 18:03.548
>> I thawing everybody would
think that, I was going to trump

18:03.550 --> 18:06.684
Them all.
It's a birthday present good

18:06.686 --> 18:09.120
Luck charm for today.
>> thank you, kass.

18:09.122 --> 18:09.954
Very cute.
Thank you.

18:09.956 --> 18:13.758
>> I think the winner of "second
chance" will be someone who

18:13.760 --> 18:18.896
Truly embraces evolution and
change, and for me that's being

18:18.898 --> 18:25.636
This more open person.
>> oh ye of little faith, as if

18:25.638 --> 18:36.414
I have the skills to make an
idol.

18:36.416 --> 18:40.818
>> so what's the deal, spencer,
with you?

18:40.820 --> 18:43.454
>> like strategically you mean?
>> she voted against me.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.356
>> yeah?
>> you were next to go?

18:45.358 --> 18:49.861
>> I was next to go.
The facts are four bayon and two

18:49.863 --> 18:52.697
Former ta keo, so I know
immediately that wiglesworth and

18:52.699 --> 18:57.368
I are in some degree of trouble,
which puts me in a position of

18:57.370 --> 18:59.871
Having to throw wiglesworth
under the bus.

18:59.873 --> 19:03.574
>> would you get rid of kelly?
>> yeah.

19:03.576 --> 19:05.676
There are people over there who
own her vote?

19:05.678 --> 19:11.015
>> terry, woo, varner.
I need to make it clear to my

19:11.017 --> 19:13.851
Tribe that there are people
wiglesworth will run back to in

19:13.853 --> 19:16.154
The future.
Wiglesworth does have a tight

19:16.156 --> 19:19.824
Bond with like terry and woo.
>> yes, she has terry, woo.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.927
>> even wentworth, right, is
good with...

19:22.929 --> 19:26.597
>> she's good with all of them.
>> spencer says that kelly

19:26.599 --> 19:30.468
Wiglesworth has a ton of people
that are in her alliance, but I

19:30.470 --> 19:32.303
Don't think he's being
completely truthful.

19:32.305 --> 19:36.874
>> I don't know if she is, if
she is genuine...

19:36.876 --> 19:41.546
>> he's a little bit sneaky, so
my first gut reaction was, as

19:41.548 --> 19:44.015
Women, we should be strong, we
should stick together, not only

19:44.017 --> 19:50.888
To keep the girl count up in the
hopes of maybe doing a girls

19:50.890 --> 19:54.025
Alliance, but also to keep the
boys count down.

19:54.027 --> 19:57.461
>> she's someone I will always
have trouble trusting.

19:57.463 --> 20:00.464
>> this is all stuff we've been
thinking about.

20:00.466 --> 20:02.700
So once a challenge is lost,
spencer needs to go first.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.302
>> I'm 100% with it.
>> me too.

20:04.304 --> 20:06.904
I love it.
>> boom.

20:26.725 --> 20:37.568
>> jeff: Come on in, guys.
All right.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.870
You guys ready to get to today's
immunity challenge?

20:39.872 --> 20:42.673
>> yes.
>> jeff: First things first, I

20:42.675 --> 20:48.279
Will take back the idols.
Kass.

20:48.281 --> 20:50.181
Kimmi.
Once again immunity is back up

20:50.183 --> 20:52.216
For grabs.
For today's challenge, one tribe

20:52.218 --> 20:55.987
Member will be your caller.
The rest of the tribe will be

20:55.989 --> 20:58.656
Blindfolded.
Using only verbal commands, the

20:58.658 --> 21:01.392
Caller will direct the
blindfolded tribe members to

21:01.394 --> 21:07.898
Collect a series of very large
and very heavy puzzle pieces.

21:07.900 --> 21:10.801
Once you have all the puzzle
pieces, take off your blind

21:10.803 --> 21:13.304
Folds and work together to solve
the puzzle.

21:13.306 --> 21:17.141
First two tribes to finish win
immunity.

21:17.143 --> 21:22.380
Safe from the vote.
Losers, tribal council where

21:22.382 --> 21:24.782
Somebody will be the fourth
person voted out of second

21:24.784 --> 21:26.550
Chance.
Bayon, you have one extra

21:26.552 --> 21:27.985
Member.
Sitting someone out.

21:27.987 --> 21:31.589
Who is it going to be?
Monica going to sit out.

21:31.591 --> 21:34.191
Ta keo one extra member.
Who is it going to be?

21:34.193 --> 21:37.762
>> ciera.
>> jeff: Everybody else take a

21:37.764 --> 21:40.631
Minute to strategize and we'll
get started.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.900
All right.
We have our caller.

21:42.902 --> 21:48.205
It is jeff for angkor, kimmi for
bayon, kass for ta keo.

21:48.207 --> 21:55.079
Here we go.
For immunity, survivors ready?

21:55.081 --> 21:58.516
>> you're going to the rim.
>> jeff: It's all about

21:58.518 --> 22:00.551
Communication.
>> turn around.

22:00.553 --> 22:03.487
>> louder, kimmi, I can't hear
you.

22:03.489 --> 22:06.223
>> jeff: The tribe who
communicates together the best

22:06.225 --> 22:10.294
Will succeed.
>> turn, terry, turn to your

22:10.296 --> 22:12.129
Right.
No, not that one.

22:12.131 --> 22:15.933
>> to the left.
Behind you, andrew, behind you.

22:15.935 --> 22:18.536
There you go.
>> jeff: There are 16 puzzle

22:18.538 --> 22:20.071
Pieces out here.
That is a lot.

22:20.073 --> 22:22.606
They are all heavy and
unwielded.

22:22.608 --> 22:25.910
Very hard for one person to
carry one alone.

22:25.912 --> 22:29.213
>> to your right.
To your right.

22:29.215 --> 22:31.916
>> jeff: Bayon back with their
first piece.

22:31.918 --> 22:33.818

22:49.369 --> 22:53.104
>> left, left.
Keith, drop it.

22:53.106 --> 22:55.806
>> jeff: It's hard to hear
when everybody is yelling.

22:55.808 --> 22:59.510
>> I can't hear.
>> drop it.

22:59.512 --> 23:01.779

Third piece.
>> kass, give me something.

23:07.553 --> 23:11.789
>> joe!
>> jeff: Dietz continues to

23:11.791 --> 23:14.725
Wait for help, like waiting to
get called on in class.

23:14.727 --> 23:16.660
Teacher doesn't see him.
>> straight, straight, straight.

23:16.662 --> 23:20.030
>> drop it, drop it, drop it.
>> jeff: Angkor in the lead

23:20.032 --> 23:22.099
With four petes.
Bayon and ta keo each with

23:22.101 --> 23:23.734
Three.
>> turn around, terry.

23:23.736 --> 23:27.538
>> kass, we need help.
>> I'm yelling at someone else.

23:27.540 --> 23:29.740
>> I can't hear.
>> drop it.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.976
>> jeff: Bayon with their
fourth piece.

23:31.978 --> 23:35.513
16 pieces.
There are still a lot of pieces

23:35.515 --> 23:44.755
Left to find.
Angkor in the lead with 11.

23:44.757 --> 23:46.690
They won the last reward
challenge.

23:46.692 --> 23:49.693
Would love to have another
victory.

23:49.695 --> 23:53.063
Ten for bayon.
Ta keo with seven.

23:53.065 --> 23:57.334
Ta keo in dead last right now.

23:57.336 --> 24:00.738
>> jeff: Dietz like the guy at
the party that no one will talk

24:00.740 --> 24:04.275

Dance.
>> joe!

24:05.611 --> 24:09.079
>> jeff: Joe just picking a
piece up on his own.

24:09.081 --> 24:12.783
These pieces are massive, but

24:12.785 --> 24:15.786
Else.
Joe back with another piece,

Joe with a full-on sprint.
Ta keo now in the lead with 15.

25:04.504 --> 25:07.738
Big comeback.
Ta keo came from dead last.

25:07.740 --> 25:11.942
Ta keo with one piece left.
Bayon and angkor with two.

25:11.944 --> 25:15.145
You are not even half-way done.
You still have to solve this

25:15.147 --> 25:16.013
Puzzle.
>> drop it.

25:16.015 --> 25:19.750
>> jeff: One piece left for

25:19.752 --> 25:22.586
That's 15 for bayon.
Everybody on their last piece.

25:29.595 --> 25:32.029
>> jeff: Joe and dietz now
paired up together.

25:32.031 --> 25:34.632
Terry was really on his own.
Now he's got a partner.

25:34.634 --> 25:39.136
>> let's go.
>> jeff: Ta keo with their

25:39.138 --> 25:41.872
16th piece.
Take off your blindfold and

25:41.874 --> 25:44.508
Start working.
Angkor has their 16th piece.

25:44.510 --> 25:47.244
Take off your masks.
>> I can see.

25:47.246 --> 25:48.579
>> jeff: Huge immunity on the
line.

25:48.581 --> 25:50.915
>> it's so bright.
>> oh, my god.

25:50.917 --> 25:52.683
>> jeff: Bayon has their
16th.

25:52.685 --> 25:57.021
Take off your masks.
Everybody working on the puzzle

25:57.023 --> 25:58.589
Now.
It is a cube.

25:58.591 --> 26:03.394
There is a pattern on each side.
It's the insignia of your

26:03.396 --> 26:05.296
Tribe's flag.
You've been living with it.

26:05.298 --> 26:09.500
You know what it looks like.
The more progress you make, the

26:09.502 --> 26:11.969
Easier it will get.
>> joe, I think this goes over

26:11.971 --> 26:17.007
Here.
>> get the b for bayon.

26:17.009 --> 26:20.744
>> jeff: Dietz is taking over.
One of the biggest difficulties

26:20.746 --> 26:24.448
Of this puzzle is the weight and
sizes of the pieces.

26:24.450 --> 26:27.484
Just moving them takes so much
work.

26:27.486 --> 26:29.954
The sun is beating down hot.
Everyone can feel it.

26:29.956 --> 26:33.090
>> varner, back here.
>> jeff: Tasha starting to

26:33.092 --> 26:37.761
Call out some orders now.
>> ow.

26:37.763 --> 26:42.433
>> jeff: Varner drops a piece
on himself.

26:42.435 --> 26:45.102
Angkor spent a lot of time
moving a lot of pieces, but

26:45.104 --> 26:48.305
Right now they don't look like
they've made any progress at

26:48.307 --> 26:51.342
All.
This is a race between ta keo

26:51.344 --> 26:55.179
And bayon.
Bayon is making a lot of

26:55.181 --> 26:58.882
Progress.
If they're right.

26:58.884 --> 27:01.719
Bayon was last to get all their
pieces, but they're making the

27:01.721 --> 27:03.787
Most progress on the puzzle.
>> just like that, yeah.

27:03.789 --> 27:05.189
>> spencer thinks he's got
something.

27:05.191 --> 27:08.592
>> good job, spencer.
>> jeff: Bayon getting very

27:08.594 --> 27:12.563
Close.
Bayon for the win.

27:12.565 --> 27:18.636
Bayon wins immunity!
We're looking for second place.

27:18.638 --> 27:22.239
It's now ta keo and angkor
fighting now to make sure it's

27:22.241 --> 27:24.308
Not them that goes to tribal
council.

27:24.310 --> 27:26.977
Ta keo in the lead.
Angkor can get back in this if

27:26.979 --> 27:32.449
They can find the energy.
>> come on.

27:32.451 --> 27:34.451
Angkor literally sleeping on the
pieces.

27:34.453 --> 27:37.254
Ta keo getting closer with every
piece.

27:37.256 --> 27:40.924
You can see the exhaustion on
the faces of angkor.

27:40.926 --> 27:44.895
Almost as if they're just
waiting for ta keo to win.

27:44.897 --> 27:50.868
So we can be done.
Ta keo with one piece left.

27:50.870 --> 27:55.506
Ta keo wins immunity sending
angkor back the tribal council

27:55.508 --> 28:08.118
For the second straight time.

28:13.324 --> 28:15.659
Bayon, congratulations.
>> good job.

28:15.661 --> 28:18.462
>> thank you.
>> jeff: Nobody going home

28:18.464 --> 28:25.202
From bayon, and nobody going
home from ta keo.

28:25.204 --> 28:28.872
>> good job.
>> jeff: Angkor, tribal

28:28.874 --> 28:32.042
Council once again, you have to
ask, savage, did you just give

28:32.044 --> 28:34.278
Out?
>> that's all we had.

28:34.280 --> 28:38.182
I've never been in a state.
I played college football.

28:38.184 --> 28:42.553
I was never as close to this and
I gave it everything I've had.

28:42.555 --> 28:45.889
I've never been here.
It's humbling.

28:45.891 --> 28:50.494
It's scary.
I'm ready to fall over.

28:50.496 --> 28:52.896
>> jeff: Angkor, I wish I
could tell you something

28:52.898 --> 28:56.767
Positive was waiting for you
back at camp, but I can't.

28:56.769 --> 28:58.902
Bayon, ta keo, grab your stuff.
Head back to camp.

28:58.904 --> 29:01.538
In tribal council tonight.
>> good job, you guys.

29:01.540 --> 29:03.841
>> good job.
>> way to hustle.

29:03.843 --> 29:06.310
>> jeff: Angkor, the only
thing waiting for you is a date

29:06.312 --> 29:08.712
With me tonight at tribal
council where somebody will be

29:08.714 --> 29:12.416
The fourth person voted out of
"second chance."

29:12.418 --> 29:16.787
Grab your stuff.
Head back to camp.

29:37.642 --> 29:38.142
>> good effort, guys.
Varner, good calling.

29:38.144 --> 29:40.511
>> hey, we did our best.
>> yeah, we did.

29:40.513 --> 29:47.718
>> oh, man.
>> good feeling from the full

29:47.720 --> 29:50.120
Belly is gone.
>> gone, man.

29:50.122 --> 29:53.524
We went into today thinking
we're going to just decimate

29:53.526 --> 29:56.760
Those guys and continue this
high high, and we just got

29:56.762 --> 29:59.463
Thumped by the most physical
challenge I've ever participated

29:59.465 --> 30:03.433
In, so we just hit this rock
bottom low low, got to go to

30:03.435 --> 30:05.869
Tribal and send somebody home.
>> varner, you okay?

30:05.871 --> 30:10.507
>> it's my pinkie toe.
It's going to hurt like a bitch

30:10.509 --> 30:14.278
For a few days.
I am absolutely no threat to

30:14.280 --> 30:16.814
Anyone.
>> for the record, varner is not

30:16.816 --> 30:21.785
A physical threat.
>> thanks to abi, savage and I

30:21.787 --> 30:26.056
Have fought our way from the
bottom to what appears to be the

30:26.058 --> 30:30.394
Top, however, abi is
unpredictable.

30:30.396 --> 30:32.429
She'll make a decision, she'll
be solid.

30:32.431 --> 30:42.806
A few minutes later she doesn't
know, and that worries me.

30:42.808 --> 30:52.716
>> she's very cunning.
>> yes.

30:52.718 --> 30:54.484
>> it's me or you?
>> yeah.

30:54.486 --> 30:58.889
>> I think it's me.
>> you think?

30:58.891 --> 31:02.092
>> I do.
They're not telling me anything.

31:02.094 --> 31:05.696
They came over and took over.
And now that abi's officially

31:05.698 --> 31:07.764
Flipped, they have the power.
There's nothing we can do.

31:07.766 --> 31:11.201
>> right.
>> clearly it's either me or woo

31:11.203 --> 31:14.037
Tonight.
Abi is so in their laps right

31:14.039 --> 31:17.207
Now, she's completely turned her
back on both of us.

31:17.209 --> 31:21.044
But the one thing that I have
working for me is I've never

31:21.046 --> 31:23.780
Voted for abi.
I have saved abi twice.

31:23.782 --> 31:28.118
So if abi's the one making all
the calls here, I might just

31:28.120 --> 31:39.796
Squeak by another week.
>> when we first got to this

31:39.798 --> 31:45.836
Camp we were up 4-2, now we're
looking at greg rid of all the

31:45.838 --> 31:48.305
Old ta keo tribe.
It kind of worries me, man.

31:48.307 --> 31:52.142
How do you feel?
>> it feels good to be wanted.

31:52.144 --> 31:55.846
>> yeah, yeah.
>> they're making me feel so

31:55.848 --> 31:57.481
Comfortable in such a good spot,
so I'm...

31:57.483 --> 31:59.783
>> don't get too comfortable,
abi.

31:59.785 --> 32:03.654
>> I know that.
I understand why they're so

32:03.656 --> 32:04.788
Buddy-buddy.
Because they need you.

32:04.790 --> 32:06.556
>> all right.
What if we took out varner.

32:06.558 --> 32:11.495
>> you have to remember, you
voted for me twice.

32:11.497 --> 32:14.631
And it's not something that I
consider because he says that he

32:14.633 --> 32:19.102
Wants to work with me, but then
he kind of like stabs me behind

32:19.104 --> 32:23.240
My back.
And I'm going with people that

32:23.242 --> 32:26.777
Value my personality and what I
wring to the table.

32:26.779 --> 32:29.913
Just put yourself in my shoes.
>> I understand the situation.

32:29.915 --> 32:32.115
>> I know you're going with the
numbers.

32:32.117 --> 32:34.151
I get it.
No hard feelings, but how does

32:34.153 --> 32:36.153
That make me feel?
>> uh-huh.

32:36.155 --> 32:41.191
>> I tried to rekindle our
relationship with abi, but she

32:41.193 --> 32:43.927
Was pretty upset.
I did write her name down twice,

32:43.929 --> 32:48.031
And she does have a grudge, and
if she's looking for some

32:48.033 --> 32:52.002
Retaliation or vengeance upon
me, then I could be facing a lot

32:52.004 --> 33:01.745
Of trouble going into tribal
tonight.

33:01.747 --> 33:05.415
>> what do you think in.
>> he has voted for me twice.

33:05.417 --> 33:08.618
He's not a loyal guy toward me.
There's something about him that

33:08.620 --> 33:13.156
Wants to get me out of here.
>> here's the thing, varner, I

33:13.158 --> 33:16.893
Thought he should have gone last
time, but...

33:16.895 --> 33:19.696
>> but he's not proven anything
to me so far.

33:19.698 --> 33:23.834
>> abi is totally fixated on I
don't trust woo.

33:23.836 --> 33:27.404
Woo wrote my name down twice.
But the thing is, woo can help

33:27.406 --> 33:31.241
Us win challenges.
But abi just is contrary.

33:31.243 --> 33:35.846
You say it's blue, she'll say
it's yellow.

33:35.848 --> 33:39.349
Who do you think we're going the
lose immunity with, woo, or

33:39.351 --> 33:40.984
Varner?
Who is the biggest liability in.

33:40.986 --> 33:44.054
>> yeah, but varner has
protected me many times.

33:44.056 --> 33:47.991
He has proven his loyalty to me.
>> I appreciate his loyalty.

33:47.993 --> 33:50.527
>> give me the benefit of the
doubt.

33:50.529 --> 33:54.264
>> I think if you want to be
loyal to jeff...

33:54.266 --> 33:57.901
>> he was loyal to me before.
>> if that makes you sleep at

33:57.903 --> 34:00.871
Night...
>> it's not about that, tasha.

34:00.873 --> 34:02.606
I'm thinking.
I'm thinking.

34:02.608 --> 34:04.574
I'm thinking.
I'm thinking.

34:04.576 --> 34:08.277
I'm thinking.
Woo, woo, woo hasn't been loyal

34:08.280 --> 34:10.914
To me.
>> what scares me is varner is

34:10.916 --> 34:15.252
Very manipulative, and at any
moment he could work his magic,

34:15.254 --> 34:19.289
And now I've lost abi.
>> I love you.

34:19.291 --> 34:21.425
You know that.
We've worked well together.

34:21.427 --> 34:24.628
I kind of miss you.
Like we don't talk and cut up

34:24.630 --> 34:27.197
Like we did before.
I miss my abi time.

34:27.199 --> 34:30.000
>> oh.
>> abi's like the pivotal piece

34:30.002 --> 34:32.768
To this puzzle.
And we might have to do whatever

34:32.771 --> 34:41.777
She wants, otherwise abi's going
to be pissed.

34:41.780 --> 34:44.514
>> tonight I have a huge
decision.

34:44.516 --> 34:48.585
It all comes down to winning
challenges versus trust and

34:48.587 --> 34:52.456
Loyalty.
And I hate having to be the

34:52.458 --> 35:08.305
Decision maker.

35:20.919 --> 35:22.169
>> jeff: So varner, let's talk
about the cane.

35:22.170 --> 35:23.420
Is that directly from today's
challenge?

35:23.422 --> 35:27.224
>> yeah, one of those big pieces
slammed right dunne on my foot.

35:27.226 --> 35:29.092
And it's purple.
It's painful.

35:29.094 --> 35:31.461
And today was a nightmare.
I have never felt like this.

35:31.463 --> 35:36.700
I mean, to not be able to put
two socks together, to get up to

35:36.702 --> 35:43.106
Walk to use the bathroom...
>> oh, my gosh!

35:43.108 --> 35:46.977
>> to deal with moments like
that, it drains you, but I just

35:46.979 --> 35:49.846
Keep thinking of the millions of
people who voted me here, and I

35:49.848 --> 35:53.550
Keep going.
>> jeff: So, woo, there had to

35:53.552 --> 35:57.554
Be a part of you going, varner
would seem like an easy volt.

35:57.556 --> 36:00.090
He's injured.
>> varner and I, we feel like

36:00.092 --> 36:02.926
We're on the bottom, and it's
tough, but it's all about being

36:02.928 --> 36:06.530
Able to outlast one another.
I'll be able to outlast him for

36:06.532 --> 36:09.466
Sure.
>> jeff: Abi, woo says it's

36:09.468 --> 36:11.535
Him or varner, does that sound
right to you.

36:11.537 --> 36:13.570
>> yes.
>> jeff: Is this an easy vote

36:13.572 --> 36:15.472
Or difficult?
>> I don't know.

36:15.474 --> 36:18.909
You know, I have been reflecting
all day, and I haven't made my

36:18.911 --> 36:21.478
Mind up.
I mean, varner has been very

36:21.480 --> 36:27.450
Loyal to me throughout the game,
but we want the win challenges.

36:27.452 --> 36:30.153
>> jeff: Savage, you could
argue that varner hasn't been a

36:30.155 --> 36:31.555
Lot of help at any of the
challenges.

36:31.557 --> 36:34.791
>> true.
This is "survivor," though, and

36:34.793 --> 36:38.328
You have to look to the future,
so when a merge come, woo's a

36:38.330 --> 36:40.297
Stud.
Do we want to go up against him

36:40.299 --> 36:46.203
One on one in challenges?
It's just something to think

36:46.205 --> 36:47.904
About.
>> but the merge is not going to

36:47.906 --> 36:49.739
Happen any time soon.
>> we don't know that.

36:49.741 --> 36:52.542
We don't know that.
>> I'm going to be an asset for

36:52.544 --> 36:57.647
You guys.
Varner will not.

36:57.649 --> 37:02.586
>> woo is going to be your
nemesis and I am not a physical

37:02.588 --> 37:05.121
Threat to anybody.
>> jeff: Woo, you're always

37:05.123 --> 37:08.091
Going to be seen as a possible
threat to win if you get to the

37:08.093 --> 37:11.127
Individual portion.
>> sure, but I am that pivotal

37:11.129 --> 37:16.299
Player that's going to stay
loyal, that's going to die for

37:16.301 --> 37:19.970
My alliance.
>> but you haven't been in this

37:19.972 --> 37:21.871
Alike, you voted against it,
twice.

37:21.873 --> 37:24.841
>> twice.
>> and I was loyal to these guys

37:24.843 --> 37:28.712
At the last tribal council, and
if I may make a pitch here...

37:28.714 --> 37:31.781
>> jeff: Yes.
>> tasha, you've been closed off

37:31.783 --> 37:37.187
To me because I think you see me
as this crappy person, but I

37:37.189 --> 37:41.024
Trust you and I am loyal to you.
Savage, absolutely loyal to you.

37:41.026 --> 37:44.661
We're both old school.
And abi, I have been loyal to

37:44.663 --> 37:47.397
You since day one.
Because I adore you.

37:47.399 --> 37:50.133
I will not vote for you.
I have not voted for you.

37:50.135 --> 37:53.136
I am loyal to you until the end
of it.

37:53.138 --> 38:00.577
So I hope you repay that to me.
>> jeff: Wow.

38:00.579 --> 38:04.447
Abi, that was a good pitch.
>> that was a good pitch, and I

38:04.449 --> 38:08.952
Just really don't know what to
do.

38:08.954 --> 38:11.521
>> jeff: Tasha, weigh it out
from your point of view, because

38:11.523 --> 38:13.156
Both of them have made good
arguments.

38:13.158 --> 38:18.395
>> all I know is that in order
to win, we need strong people.

38:18.397 --> 38:21.965
So that's woo.
Loyalty, physical ability,

38:21.967 --> 38:24.601
That's what I'm weighing.
>> I have both.

38:24.603 --> 38:26.269
I give you the loyalty and
physical threat.

38:26.271 --> 38:30.273
>> you're giving it to her.
You haven't given it to me yet.

38:30.275 --> 38:34.978
>> you voted against abi twice.
>> sure, I voted against abi,

38:34.980 --> 38:37.514
But I'm telling you guys right
now, I'm willing to jump on

38:37.516 --> 38:40.250
Board with you guys.
Varner's got relationships with

38:40.252 --> 38:41.751
Everyone from the old ta keo
tribe.

38:41.753 --> 38:43.920
How can you trust that he won't
just flip on you.

38:43.922 --> 38:48.858
>> we have relationships too
with these people.

38:48.860 --> 38:51.628
>> you're cutting them now.
>> you're playing the game hard

38:51.630 --> 38:54.230
And I respect that, but you can
play the game watching your own

38:54.232 --> 38:56.132
Neck.
I'm looking out for the better

38:56.134 --> 38:57.967
Good of the group.
>> in terms of committing to

38:57.969 --> 39:00.904
These guys, one of us has proven
they're there, the other has

39:00.906 --> 39:03.139
Not.
>> but I built a relationship

39:03.141 --> 39:05.342
With you guys the past five, six
days.

39:05.344 --> 39:07.277
I'm willing to commit and stick
to it.

39:07.279 --> 39:10.580
I promise.
>> jeff: Wow.

39:10.582 --> 39:12.082
>> wow.
>> wow.

39:12.084 --> 39:14.884
>> wow.
>> jeff: I love the fight.

39:14.886 --> 39:19.322
There is nobody here that wants
to give up.

39:19.324 --> 39:22.192
>> can we vote?
>> let's do it.

39:22.194 --> 39:23.960
>> jeff: All right.
You guys want to vote?

39:23.962 --> 39:26.262
Let's vote.
Woo, you're up.

39:26.264 --> 39:33.103
>> abi, I promise you right here
right now that I will stay

39:33.105 --> 39:38.541
Loyal.
Don't vote me out.

39:38.543 --> 39:45.081
>> make sure you don't write
abi.

39:45.083 --> 39:57.293
>> I really hope it's not me
tonight.

39:59.063 --> 40:06.403
>> you rock.

40:12.276 --> 40:15.578

Silver lining to tribal council,
