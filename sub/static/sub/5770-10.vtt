07:28.056 --> 07:29.536
I'M NOT GOOD AT THAT.

07:29.579 --> 07:31.581
REMEMBER THAT TIME I BAILED
MY OWN MUGGER OUT OF JAIL?

07:31.625 --> 07:32.713
AND THEN I BOUGHT HIM
A SPORT COAT,

07:32.756 --> 07:34.628
SO HE COULD GO
ON JOB INTERVIEWS. [sighs]

07:34.671 --> 07:37.544
[elevator chimes]

07:37.587 --> 07:38.806
DOCTOR, DOCTOR.

07:38.849 --> 07:39.981
WITCH DOCTOR.

07:40.024 --> 07:41.373
OH, YOU JOKE,

07:41.417 --> 07:43.506
BUT THE PERSECUTION
OF MIDWIVES AS WITCHES

07:43.550 --> 07:45.290
IS A TRAGIC HISTORICAL FACT.

07:45.334 --> 07:47.510
OH, BOOHOO-HOO,
DESLAURIER.

07:47.554 --> 07:48.729
MIDWIFE MARGARET JONES

07:48.772 --> 07:51.296
WAS HANGED FOR WITCHCRAFT,
CHARLESTON, 1648.

07:51.340 --> 07:52.646
SHE WAS THE SUBJECT

07:52.689 --> 07:53.951
OF MY INJUSTICE STUDIES THESIS
AT BROWN.

07:53.995 --> 07:54.952
[gags]

07:54.996 --> 07:56.563
OH, THAT'S MATURE.

07:56.606 --> 07:58.565
I'M ACTUALLY NOT DOING
"GAG ME WITH A SPOON,"

07:58.608 --> 08:00.001
ALTHOUGH THAT IS HILARIOUS.

08:00.044 --> 08:01.568
THIS IS RELATED
TO MY STRESS BARFS.

08:01.611 --> 08:03.265
STRESS-INDUCED NAUSEA.

08:03.308 --> 08:06.616
I CAN HELP YOU WITH THAT.
HOT STONE THERAPY.

08:06.660 --> 08:07.617
GOD.

08:07.661 --> 08:09.140
UH, YEAH,

08:09.184 --> 08:10.577
LIKE I'M GONNA LET YOU
PUT HOT STONES

08:10.620 --> 08:12.013
ALL OVER MY BODY, YOU PERVERT.YEAH, MAN.

08:12.056 --> 08:14.450
SHE'S NOT GONNA LET YOU
TOUCH HER WITH HOT ROCKS.

08:14.494 --> 08:15.495
STONES.

08:15.538 --> 08:17.105
STONES
ARE BABY ROCKS.

08:17.148 --> 08:18.541
WELL, PEBBLES
ARE BABY ROCKS, ACTUALLY.

08:18.585 --> 08:21.544
AND THE GRAND CANYON
IS ONE GIANT ROCK. WHO CARES?

08:21.588 --> 08:22.719
WELL, IT'S ACTUALLY
THE LACK OF ROCK

08:22.763 --> 08:23.851
THAT MAKES IT A CANYON,
BUT...

08:23.894 --> 08:25.635
YEAH, IT'S A--NOT TO SPLIT HAIRS.

08:25.679 --> 08:28.638
OKAY, I'M NOT AN EXPERT IN
SEDIMENT AND GEOLOGY, ALL RIGHT?

08:28.682 --> 08:30.597
I CAN'T DO THAT IN ADDITION
TO BEING AN EXPERT

08:30.640 --> 08:32.555
IN WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH,
OKAY?

08:32.599 --> 08:34.339
I CAN'T DO THAT, AND BA--
[gags]

08:34.383 --> 08:36.472
WOULD YOU STOP--OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

08:36.516 --> 08:37.691
ALL RIGHT NOW.LET'S GET YOU OUT OF HERE.

08:37.734 --> 08:41.433
[Mike]
OUT OF THE WAY, SHARON.

08:41.477 --> 08:43.435
HEY, HOW'S IT GOING? WE'RE
FROM SHULMAN AND ASSOCIATES.

08:43.479 --> 08:45.786
JUST NEED TO TALK
TO SOMEBODY ABOUT OUR RENT.

08:45.829 --> 08:46.874
IS GEORGE AROUND?

08:46.917 --> 08:49.572
'SUP?
I'M MIKE, HIS SON,

08:49.616 --> 08:52.401
AS IN GEORGE MANKIN
AND SONPROPERTIES.

08:52.444 --> 08:54.185
MY DAD'S MOVED ON.

08:54.229 --> 08:56.013
GOD, I'M SO SORRY.
MY CONDOLENCES.

08:56.057 --> 08:57.362
NOTHING TO CONDOLE,
BRAH.

08:57.406 --> 08:59.800
I SAID THAT MISLEADINGLY,
AND YOU FELL FOR IT.

08:59.843 --> 09:01.758
IT'S A WAY TO SHOW DOMINANCE
AT BUSINESS MEETINGS.

09:01.802 --> 09:03.630
OKAY, LOOK,
IF YOU'RE DAD'S ALIVE,

09:03.673 --> 09:05.762
WE NEED TO TALK TO HIM,
SO WHERE IS HE?

09:05.806 --> 09:07.590
PUT HIM IN A HOME
IN QUEENS.

09:07.634 --> 09:08.765
YEAH, HE STARTED
TO GET DEMENTIA.

09:08.809 --> 09:10.506
DEMENTIA?
SINCE WHEN?

09:10.550 --> 09:13.335
SINCE HE STARTED CHARGING
YOU DORKS THAT LOW-ASS RATE.

09:13.378 --> 09:15.642
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
WE'RE NOT DORKS.

09:15.685 --> 09:16.991
WE'RE NOT--
NO.

09:17.034 --> 09:19.384
NO, AND SECOND OF ALL,
YOUR DAD'S A GREAT GUY, MAN,

09:19.428 --> 09:20.429
AND HE'D NEVER GO
FOR THIS.

09:20.472 --> 09:24.564
WOULD HE GO FOR THIS?

09:24.607 --> 09:25.565
OKAY, OKAY.
COME ON.

09:25.608 --> 09:26.696
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?COME ON.

09:26.740 --> 09:27.697
I'M GONNA KNOCK YOU OUT.

09:27.741 --> 09:29.307
DANNY, DANNY, DANNY,
WHOA.

09:29.351 --> 09:31.614
DANNY, WHY DON'T WE GO
AND VISIT GEORGE TOMORROW,

09:31.658 --> 09:33.181
PERSUADE HIM
OF SOME THINGS.

09:33.224 --> 09:34.704
MAYBE HE'D APPRECIATE
OUR COMPANY.

09:34.748 --> 09:36.663
YOU KNOW,
GET CRAFTY, DANNY.

09:36.706 --> 09:38.142
NO, I DON'T WANNA
GET CRAFTY.

09:38.186 --> 09:39.622
JUST MOVE OUT OF THE WAY,
SO I CAN KNOCK THIS GUY OUT.

09:39.666 --> 09:40.884
NO, NO, NO.STOP SHOOTING AT US!

09:40.928 --> 09:43.017
DANNY, DANNY, DANNY,
MY FAMILY HAS A SAYING--

09:43.060 --> 09:44.584
OKAY, THAT NEARLY
GOT ME IN THE EYE.

09:44.627 --> 09:46.281
I AM SEEING
A 3-D MOVIE TONIGHT.

09:46.324 --> 09:48.588
IF MY EXPERIENCE IS HAMPERED
BY THIS NERF NONSENSE,

09:48.631 --> 09:52.504
I WILL SEND YOU A BILL,
AND I WILL EXPECT YOU TO PAY IT.

09:57.814 --> 09:59.120
OH, MY GOD!

09:59.163 --> 10:00.817
WAIT, IT'S COOL.
I GOT DRAWERS ON.

10:00.861 --> 10:02.689
NO, THAT BUBBLE BATH
IS $68 A BOTTLE.

10:02.732 --> 10:03.951
AND WORTH EVERY PENNY.

10:03.994 --> 10:06.388
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:06.431 --> 10:08.129
WELL, I TRIED WRITING RHYMES
IN THE SHOWER,

10:08.172 --> 10:09.696
BUT MY NOTEBOOK
KEPT GETTING WET.

10:09.739 --> 10:12.524
CAN YOU PLEASE, PLEASE JUST WAIT
TILL YOU GRADUATE COLLEGE

10:12.568 --> 10:13.656
BEFORE YOU PURSUE
THIS RAP STUFF?

10:13.700 --> 10:16.006
MINDY, I REALLY APPRECIATE
YOUR SUPPORT,

10:16.050 --> 10:18.443
BUT HIP-HOP
IS NOTORIOUSLY AGEIST, OKAY?

10:18.487 --> 10:21.708
LIL WAYNE, LIL' FLIP,
YOUNG JEEZY, YOUNG BUCK--

10:21.751 --> 10:24.362
BUT WHAT ABOUT THAT MAN
OL' DIRTY BASTARD?

10:24.406 --> 10:25.363
HE SEEMS TO BE DOING
PRETTY WELL.

10:25.407 --> 10:26.451
HE'S DEAD.

10:26.495 --> 10:27.931
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, RISHI.

10:27.975 --> 10:29.629
CLEARLY,
I HAVE SPOILED YOU,

10:29.672 --> 10:31.326
AND YOU HAVE COMPLETELY
LOST TRACK

10:31.369 --> 10:32.370
OF WHAT IS IMPORTANT
IN LIFE.

10:32.414 --> 10:34.242
WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU,
OKAY?

10:34.285 --> 10:35.722
THIS IS IMPORTANT
TO ME,

10:35.765 --> 10:37.419
SO WHY DON'T YOU
JUST SKEDADDLE ON OUT

10:37.462 --> 10:39.682
AND LET ME SOAK UP
SOME OF THESE RIGHTEOUS RHYMES.

10:39.726 --> 10:41.031
I'M SORRY,
SKEDADDLE FROM MY--

10:41.075 --> 10:43.947
BOUNCE.

10:43.991 --> 10:46.123
COME ON!

10:46.167 --> 10:50.432
SORRY, RISHI.
TOUGH LOVE.

10:50.475 --> 10:52.695
OKAY, IT IS REALLY COLD OUTSIDE,
AND YOUR HAIR IS WET,

10:52.739 --> 10:54.349
SO PLEASE WEAR THIS HAT,

10:54.392 --> 10:56.264
AND THERE IS A COUPLE OF BUCKS
ON THIS METROCARD.

10:56.307 --> 10:58.396
'CAUSE I CAN'T GIVE YOU
ANY MONEY, BUT JUST USE THAT.

10:58.440 --> 10:59.963

MY SON PUT ME IN THIS DUMP.

11:13.760 --> 11:14.804
[both]
YEAH.

11:14.848 --> 11:16.458
KID'S A REAL PIECE
OF WORK.

11:16.501 --> 11:18.982
HE JACKED UP OUR RENT
SKY-HIGH,

11:19.026 --> 11:20.462
AND WE WERE HOPING
THAT MAYBE

11:20.505 --> 11:22.856
YOU COULD GO OVER THERE
AND TALK TO HIM.

11:22.899 --> 11:23.987
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
YOU COULD DO.

11:24.031 --> 11:25.467
WELL,
I'D LOVE TO HELP, FELLAS,

11:25.510 --> 11:28.035
BUT I JUST DON'T HAVE IT IN ME
TO STAND UP TO MIKE.

11:28.078 --> 11:31.386
THIS PLACE
JUST WEAKENS THE SPIRIT.

11:31.429 --> 11:34.215
IT'S SO, SO LONELY.

11:34.258 --> 11:35.607
[Latin music]

11:35.651 --> 11:37.479
UH, GEORGE,

11:37.522 --> 11:39.786

DOMINATING HER TIME,

11:47.489 --> 11:50.013
WON'T LET ANYONE ELSE
TAKE A SHOT.

11:50.057 --> 11:52.755
YOU KNOW, GEORGE, IF WE HELP YOU
WITH YOUR PROBLEM,

11:52.799 --> 11:55.149
MAYBE YOU COULD HELP US

12:22.306 --> 12:25.135
RISHI, THIS RAP STUFF,
IT IS NOT A REAL LIFESTYLE.

I DON'T DELIVER SOMEONE'S BABY
