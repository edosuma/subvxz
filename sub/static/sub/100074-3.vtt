WEBVTT

00:00.130 --> 00:01.360
- Previously
on "God Friended Me"...

00:01.760 --> 00:04.770
- The God Account sent Joy
the Friend Suggestion, not you.

00:04.770 --> 00:06.800
- If I'm gonna do this,
I need to do it my way.

00:06.800 --> 00:07.740
- Why didn't you tell me

00:07.740 --> 00:09.540
you were a public defender
back in Chicago?

00:09.540 --> 00:11.240
- Miles was gonna tell me
that he loved me.

00:11.240 --> 00:14.210
But for some reason, I, uh,
I can't tell him that.

00:14.210 --> 00:15.540
- Did you finally tell her
you love her?

00:15.540 --> 00:16.780
- I don't need
to say anything.

00:16.780 --> 00:17.410
- But you want to.

00:17.410 --> 00:19.080
- You miss the God Account.

00:19.080 --> 00:20.950
- Why would the God Account
be taken away from me?

00:20.950 --> 00:22.720
- The God Account
left a message on your wall.

00:24.090 --> 00:25.590
- I think you were right about

00:25.590 --> 00:26.690
the "Lady"
being the Statue of Liberty.

00:26.690 --> 00:27.920
You're just at the wrong one.

00:27.920 --> 00:29.090
You need to come to Paris.

00:30.830 --> 00:33.630
- The God Account
has never been easy

00:33.630 --> 00:36.270
and almost always
requires you to take a risk,

00:36.270 --> 00:39.170
which is why I need
to follow the Lady.

00:39.170 --> 00:41.100
- Who...
it turns out,

00:41.100 --> 00:42.640
happens to be in Paris,

00:42.640 --> 00:45.810
along with another
very important lady...

00:45.810 --> 00:47.510
my girlfriend, Cara.

00:47.510 --> 00:48.880
So stay tuned,

00:48.880 --> 00:51.650
the "Millennial Prophet"
is going international.

00:56.650 --> 00:58.220
Hey, Rakesh,

00:58.220 --> 00:59.490
can you hand me
those headphones?

00:59.490 --> 01:01.190
- Here you go.

01:01.190 --> 01:02.690
- So do you really think

01:02.690 --> 01:03.930
there's a clue waiting
for you in Paris?

01:03.930 --> 01:05.560
- The fact Cara and I

01:05.560 --> 01:07.460
both ended up in front
of the Statue of Liberty

01:07.460 --> 01:10.130
in two different cities
at the exact same time--

01:10.130 --> 01:11.500
it must mean something.

01:11.500 --> 01:13.670
- And if you're wrong?

01:16.240 --> 01:18.710
- The God Account
gave me a purpose,

01:18.710 --> 01:22.180
and when it was taken away
from me, I felt lost.

01:22.180 --> 01:24.080
And then it
sent me this message,

01:24.080 --> 01:25.650
which it has to mean

01:25.650 --> 01:27.720
there is something else
it wants me to do,

01:27.720 --> 01:31.550
and if I don't figure out
what that is, then it's over...

01:31.550 --> 01:33.520
and I don't want it to be.

01:36.730 --> 01:37.960
Oh.

01:37.960 --> 01:40.500
All right, the Lyft is here.
I gotta go.

01:40.500 --> 01:42.700
And remember,

01:42.700 --> 01:47.000
if you get a Friend Suggestion
while I'm gone, give me a call.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.900
Any time, okay?

01:48.900 --> 01:50.170
- I'll be fine.

01:50.170 --> 01:51.770
- Plus, she has me.

01:53.880 --> 01:55.710
- So you're finally gonna be
face-to-face with Cara, dude.

01:55.710 --> 01:57.710
You gonna tell her
you love her or what?

01:57.710 --> 01:58.810
- Yeah.

01:58.810 --> 02:00.880
It's Paris!

02:00.880 --> 02:03.050
One of the most
romantic cities in the world.

02:03.050 --> 02:05.050
What better place is there?

02:12.700 --> 02:15.870
- Hey, don't forget
to send a postcard.

02:15.870 --> 02:16.900
Okay.

02:22.070 --> 02:24.470
- Wait, so Miles is
coming here to Paris?

02:24.470 --> 02:25.940
- Okay, I know
what you're gonna say.

02:25.940 --> 02:27.810
- Yesterday you admitted
that you weren't ready

02:27.810 --> 02:29.550
to tell Miles
that you loved him,

02:29.550 --> 02:30.910
and you didn't have to
deal with that fact

02:30.910 --> 02:32.680
because he was in New York.

02:32.680 --> 02:34.550
You really think you can just
stick your head in the sand

02:34.550 --> 02:37.250
and hope
he doesn't bring it up?

02:37.250 --> 02:40.720
- Look, if he does,
I'll deal with it, okay?

02:41.920 --> 02:44.690
But in the meantime,
he's coming here to figure out

02:44.690 --> 02:46.060
what the God Account
wants him to do next,

02:46.060 --> 02:47.860
and I'm gonna need yours
and Simon's help

02:47.860 --> 02:49.800
to make that happen.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.670
- So what kind of help
do you need?

02:51.670 --> 02:52.970
- Well,
yesterday it seemed like

02:52.970 --> 02:55.100
all the clues were pointing
to Paul Grenelle.

02:55.100 --> 02:56.740
You're in the art world.

02:56.740 --> 02:58.640
I was thinking you could
look into him for me?

02:58.640 --> 03:00.040
- Yeah, but the bridge is named
after the neighborhood,

03:00.040 --> 03:01.180
not the family.

03:01.180 --> 03:02.480
- No, I get that,

03:02.480 --> 03:04.450
but I also
know the God Account.

03:04.450 --> 03:07.480
Something is there.

03:07.480 --> 03:09.050
- Let me see
what I can find out.

03:09.050 --> 03:10.550
- Thank you.

03:25.230 --> 03:27.670
- Uh, merci.

03:27.670 --> 03:28.670
Merci.

03:35.510 --> 03:37.810
- De Ville...uh...

03:40.550 --> 03:42.180
Hey, uh, excuse me.

03:42.180 --> 03:44.050
Uh, do you know where
14 Rue de Ville is?

03:45.960 --> 03:48.760
- Um, I think the phrase
you're looking for is,

03:59.240 --> 04:00.470
- I missed you.

04:01.800 --> 04:02.810
- I missed you, too.

04:05.510 --> 04:08.180
I was thinking tomorrow
we could meet up with Annie.

04:08.180 --> 04:09.780
She's been looking into
this guy, Paul Grenelle,

04:09.780 --> 04:11.780
who we think is connected
to the God Account.

04:11.780 --> 04:15.520
- Before we get caught up in
the God Account of it all...

04:15.520 --> 04:19.190
what do you say we just
take the night to catch up?

04:21.460 --> 04:22.790
- I like that plan.

04:30.200 --> 04:32.800
- So, how's the God Account
going without Miles around?

04:32.800 --> 04:34.400
- I haven't gotten
a Friend Suggestion yet,

04:34.400 --> 04:36.740
but I am going to miss
arguing with Miles

04:36.740 --> 04:39.040
about everything when I do.

04:39.040 --> 04:41.380
- I have been arguing
with Miles for 24 years.

04:41.380 --> 04:43.850
It's never not fun.

04:43.850 --> 04:45.280
Let me know if you need any
help whenever you do get one.

04:45.280 --> 04:46.350
- Thanks.

04:48.680 --> 04:50.150
- Oh, nice!

04:50.150 --> 04:52.760
So this arcade game I bought
from Facebook Marketplace

04:52.760 --> 04:53.920
is finally arriving tomorrow.

04:53.920 --> 04:55.390
I can't tell you
how lucky I am.

04:55.390 --> 04:57.830
It just--
it popped up on my feed, right,

04:57.830 --> 05:01.030
couple of weeks ago, for sale,
and you know me--I pounced.

05:01.030 --> 05:02.830
It's gonna look great
in the office.

05:02.830 --> 05:05.670
- A video game for your office?
Really, Rakesh?

05:05.670 --> 05:07.100
- Well, you know,
some people buy plants.

05:07.100 --> 05:08.840
I bought a game.

05:08.840 --> 05:11.640
Which by the way, will never
die because I didn't water it.

05:11.640 --> 05:12.910
Anyway,
I'm meeting Jaya uptown

05:12.910 --> 05:15.080
at this new dumpling place,
so, yeah.

05:15.080 --> 05:16.310
I don't want to be late.

05:16.310 --> 05:17.710
- I'm headed uptown.
I'll give you a lift.

05:17.710 --> 05:19.250
- Thanks, Ali.
- Bye.

05:19.250 --> 05:21.320
- Later, guys.
- So this girlfriend of yours,

05:21.320 --> 05:25.120
am I ever going to meet her,
or she the imaginary kind?

05:25.120 --> 05:26.160
- Ha!

05:26.160 --> 05:27.220
Hilarious.

05:27.220 --> 05:28.660
Not only is she real,

05:28.660 --> 05:31.130
she's like,
a badass doctor, okay?

05:31.130 --> 05:32.830
Actually, you might
kind of like her.

05:32.830 --> 05:34.960
She's the take-charge type,
just like you.

05:37.200 --> 05:38.730
- Wait, which one's your ride?

05:38.730 --> 05:40.270
- The red one at the end.

05:40.270 --> 05:42.070
- The red one
getting the ticket?

05:44.310 --> 05:47.280
- Hey, you, meter maid!

05:47.680 --> 05:48.810
Stop!

05:48.810 --> 05:50.510
- It's Officer Matthews,
ma'am.

05:51.610 --> 05:53.580
- I'm within
the posted time limit.

05:53.580 --> 05:55.220
Why are you giving me a ticket?

05:55.220 --> 05:57.550
- Violation of code 45,
obstruction of traffic.

05:57.550 --> 05:59.690
You're marked more than
18 inches off the curb.

05:59.690 --> 06:01.360
- Are you kidding me?

06:01.360 --> 06:06.660
Have you even measured how many
inches off the curb I am?

06:06.660 --> 06:07.760
- Well-played.

06:07.760 --> 06:09.330
- I can still sue the city

06:09.330 --> 06:12.230
for random enforcement
of a statute without cause,

06:12.230 --> 06:14.540
so why don't you
take your little pad there,

06:14.540 --> 06:15.740
rip up that ticket,

06:15.740 --> 06:17.710
and we can all
go on our separate ways.

06:17.710 --> 06:20.080
- I'm happy to go
our separate ways.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.710
You have a nice day.

06:23.810 --> 06:27.120
- Wow, she is the worst.

06:35.620 --> 06:36.760
You've gotta be kidding me.

06:36.760 --> 06:38.430
- What is it?

06:39.790 --> 06:43.400
- Meter maid is my new
Friend Suggestion.

06:55.940 --> 06:57.340
- God, isn't Paris
the most beautiful city

06:57.340 --> 06:59.410
you've ever seen?

06:59.410 --> 07:00.610
- Mm-hmm.

07:00.610 --> 07:02.380
- You're not looking, are you?

07:02.380 --> 07:04.820
- Mm-mm.

07:05.890 --> 07:08.020
- Come on, who needs Paris

07:08.020 --> 07:12.260
when I can be
face-to-face with you?

07:12.260 --> 07:15.560
- Well, it definitely beats
face time with FaceTime.

07:23.300 --> 07:25.870
- Hey, um, Cara...

07:25.870 --> 07:28.010
since we're finally together,

07:28.010 --> 07:30.310
there's something
I need to tell you.

07:36.950 --> 07:38.390
Wait, it's from
the God Account.

07:38.390 --> 07:41.460
"The Bridge
Unlocks Your Future"?

07:41.460 --> 07:43.090
What bridge?

07:43.090 --> 07:44.360
- Bridge?

07:44.360 --> 07:45.890
The lock bridge.

07:45.890 --> 07:47.600
It's famous for couples

07:47.600 --> 07:51.070
hanging locks
as a symbol of their love.

07:51.070 --> 07:53.200
- Interesting.

07:53.200 --> 07:55.640
- Uh, I think they cut
all the locks off

07:55.640 --> 07:57.540
'cause it was
weighing the bridge down.

07:57.540 --> 07:58.910
It's...

07:58.910 --> 08:00.510
a public safety risk, so...

08:00.510 --> 08:02.910
um, anyways,
should we go check it out?

08:02.910 --> 08:04.380
- Well, what about
the Statue of Liberty?

08:04.380 --> 08:05.950
- I mean,
maybe the God Account

08:05.950 --> 08:08.150
just used the Statue of Liberty
to get you here,

08:08.150 --> 08:11.420
but it seems like it's pointing
us in another direction.

08:11.420 --> 08:13.020
What do you say?

08:13.020 --> 08:14.490
- Yeah.

08:14.490 --> 08:16.220
Get my coat.

08:20.160 --> 08:21.900
- This is why you
called me down here?

08:21.900 --> 08:22.960
To watch you
play a video game.

08:22.960 --> 08:25.530
- Uh, not just any video game,

08:25.530 --> 08:27.170
"Galactic Ninja"...

08:27.170 --> 08:29.600
8 bits of beautiful,
two-dimensional,

08:29.600 --> 08:33.240
low-res gaming enjoyment.

08:33.240 --> 08:34.840
Isn't she glorious?

08:34.840 --> 08:36.580
- You wanted to check on me,
didn't you?

08:36.580 --> 08:38.450
See how I was doing
with my Friend Suggestion?

08:38.450 --> 08:40.920
- Nuh-uh, absolutely not.

08:40.920 --> 08:42.180
But you know,
since you mentioned it,

08:42.180 --> 08:43.050
how are things going?

08:43.050 --> 08:44.920
- Sarah's worked
for the New York City

08:44.920 --> 08:46.920
traffic enforcement office
for 20 years.

08:46.920 --> 08:48.520
Husband named Dan,
he's in sales.

08:48.520 --> 08:50.930
No kids,
and they live in Brooklyn.

08:50.930 --> 08:53.630
- Okay, it's a good start.
Anything else?

08:53.630 --> 08:54.630
- From what I can see
from her old photos,

08:54.630 --> 08:56.330
she's got a happy life.

08:56.330 --> 08:58.130
I mean, see for yourself.

09:00.070 --> 09:01.840
- I mean, I guess
the whole point of social media

09:01.840 --> 09:03.270
is to make it seem like

09:03.270 --> 09:05.340
you're living your best life
at all times, right?

09:05.340 --> 09:07.310
But the God Account
wouldn't send Sarah your way

09:07.310 --> 09:08.540
if everything was fine.

09:11.480 --> 09:13.280
Uh, you got a text.

09:13.280 --> 09:14.450
- Hmm?

09:17.320 --> 09:19.520
- Everything okay?

09:19.520 --> 09:22.060
- Just a text from a friend
back in Chicago.

09:23.490 --> 09:24.890
- So, uh, did you tell Miles

09:24.890 --> 09:26.090
you got a new
Friend Suggestion?

09:26.090 --> 09:27.130
- Nope.

09:27.130 --> 09:27.960
- Why?

09:27.960 --> 09:29.130
- If I'm going to do this,

09:29.130 --> 09:31.100
I need to know
I can do it on my own.

09:31.100 --> 09:33.430
Do it my way
without Miles's help.

09:33.430 --> 09:35.540
- Yeah, I respect that.

09:35.540 --> 09:37.610
All right, well--

09:37.610 --> 09:41.780
only thing left to do...
is turn her on.

09:45.580 --> 09:47.250
- Yeah, she's dead.

09:49.020 --> 09:51.920
- The ad said it was in
good working condition--what?

09:51.920 --> 09:53.550
- Anyway, I'm off
to pay Sarah a visit.

09:53.550 --> 09:55.220
- No, wait,

09:55.220 --> 09:57.190
I cleared my entire afternoon
to play "Galactic Ninja",

09:57.190 --> 09:58.890
but clearly,
that plan is ruined,

09:58.890 --> 10:00.160
so I'm coming with you.

10:00.160 --> 10:02.860
- No, Rakesh, I got this,
remember?

10:02.860 --> 10:03.860
- Okay, yeah, I get that.

10:03.860 --> 10:05.570
But from my experience,

10:05.570 --> 10:07.470
the God Account works best
as a two-player game.

10:07.470 --> 10:09.070
- Fine.

10:09.070 --> 10:11.070
If you wanna schlep
all the way out to Brooklyn,

10:11.070 --> 10:12.810
be my guest.
- Okay.

10:17.010 --> 10:21.450
- All right, so, any thoughts
on what we're looking for?

10:21.450 --> 10:23.080
- I think it's
safe to say that

10:23.080 --> 10:25.220
we are firmly in the
"we'll know it when we see it"

10:25.220 --> 10:27.590
part of the journey.

10:27.590 --> 10:30.220
- What?

10:30.220 --> 10:32.230
- So why did the God Account

10:32.230 --> 10:34.560
bring me all the way to Paris
to solve a riddle?

10:34.560 --> 10:38.500
Why not just give me the answer
in New York?

10:38.500 --> 10:41.540
Well, maybe it's
about something else.

10:41.540 --> 10:44.170
- What could it be about?

10:44.170 --> 10:51.050
- Maybe the God Account knew
how much I missed you.

10:51.050 --> 10:52.110
- Right.

10:52.110 --> 10:53.550
It has always been
so considerate

10:53.550 --> 10:56.120
when it comes to our
feelings.

10:58.090 --> 10:59.120
Simon?

10:59.120 --> 11:00.250
- Hey, Miles.
- Hey!

11:00.250 --> 11:01.520
- How are ya, man?

11:01.520 --> 11:04.590
- Good, good to see you.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:04.590 --> 11:06.460
- What are you doing here?

11:06.460 --> 11:09.060
- Uh, I texted Simon
to come help us.

11:09.060 --> 11:11.070
Filled him in the new message,

11:11.070 --> 11:13.330
figured we could use all
the brain power at our disposal

11:13.330 --> 11:15.200
to crack this thing.
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.140
Hey, how's Henry and Pria?

11:17.140 --> 11:19.640
- They're good, they're good.
They send their best.

11:19.640 --> 11:21.540
'Bout you guys?
Find anything?

11:21.540 --> 11:23.410
Any clues?
- Nothing.

11:23.410 --> 11:24.550
- I don't know
what we're missing.

11:24.550 --> 11:26.310
- You have any ideas?

11:26.310 --> 11:27.650
- Uh, as a matter of fact,

11:27.650 --> 11:29.620
I often find that
stepping away from a problem

11:29.620 --> 11:31.350
is the best way to solve it.

11:31.350 --> 11:34.460
So, uh, why don't you join
Annie and I for some lunch?

11:34.460 --> 11:37.490
- Wait, you and Annie
are having lunch together?

11:37.490 --> 11:38.990
- Well, I assume Cara told you

11:38.990 --> 11:41.560
about her friend
whose life I destroyed.

11:41.560 --> 11:43.230
- She may have mentioned it.

11:43.230 --> 11:45.430
- Anyway,
I managed to convince her

11:45.430 --> 11:48.100
that breaking bread,
in a way, implies forgiveness.

11:48.100 --> 11:49.640
And, you know,
everyone's gotta eat.

11:49.640 --> 11:50.940
So what do you say,
you wanna join us?

11:50.940 --> 11:52.140
- Sounds good.

11:52.140 --> 11:53.370
She's looking into
the Grenelles.

11:53.370 --> 11:55.080
Maybe she's found something.

11:55.080 --> 11:56.180
- All right.

11:58.980 --> 12:00.510
- The vendor says
I can't return the game,

12:00.510 --> 12:03.320
they have an as-is policy.

12:03.320 --> 12:05.290
You're a lawyer, maybe
you can help me fight this?

12:05.290 --> 12:07.320
You know, threaten a lawsuit
or something.

12:07.320 --> 12:10.160
- You want to take legal action
over a broken video game?

12:10.160 --> 12:11.230
- Yeah, I do!

12:11.230 --> 12:12.430
- I thought you were
a tech genius.

12:12.430 --> 12:13.930
Just fix the thing.

12:13.930 --> 12:16.800
- Ugh, okay.
Sound legal advice.

12:17.600 --> 12:19.330
Can I ask you something?

12:19.330 --> 12:20.630
What happened to your career

12:20.630 --> 12:23.170
as a public defender
in Chicago?

12:23.170 --> 12:25.470
You saw the text, didn't you?

12:25.470 --> 12:26.910
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

12:26.910 --> 12:28.440
It popped up
before I could look away.

12:28.440 --> 12:29.580
What's the hearing about?

12:29.580 --> 12:31.180
- It's nothing.
- Come on.

12:31.180 --> 12:34.050
Hearings aren't usually
about nothing, right?

12:34.050 --> 12:35.880
Anything I can do to help?

12:35.880 --> 12:40.150
- Thanks, but that part
of my life is in the past.

12:40.150 --> 12:42.190
We're here.
This is Sarah's house.

12:43.490 --> 12:45.360
- What's the game plan?

12:45.360 --> 12:46.630
- Simple.

12:46.630 --> 12:49.230
Knock first,
figure it out second.

12:50.200 --> 12:51.600
- Zeke!

12:51.600 --> 12:53.130
- I'm in.

12:53.130 --> 12:56.270
- Zeke, Zeke?

12:56.940 --> 12:59.570
Please tell me you did not
track me down to my house

12:59.570 --> 13:01.310
to talk about that ticket.

13:01.310 --> 13:02.880
- Wait!

13:02.880 --> 13:05.050
- She's trying to apologize
for yesterday.

13:05.050 --> 13:06.880
- Yes, but I can see
now is not a good time.

13:06.880 --> 13:08.280
Is everything okay?

13:08.280 --> 13:10.620
- No, my brother Zeke wandered
out of the house again.

13:10.620 --> 13:12.590
He has early onset dementia.

13:12.590 --> 13:13.590
- I called some
of the neighbors.

13:13.590 --> 13:15.120
No one's seen him.

13:15.120 --> 13:16.920
- You were supposed to
keep an eye on him, Dan!

13:16.920 --> 13:19.030
- I can't keep my eye on him
every second of the day.

13:19.030 --> 13:20.460
He's getting worse, Sarah.

13:20.460 --> 13:22.060
- Uh, it looks like

13:22.060 --> 13:24.360
you guys need a little help
looking for Zeke.

13:24.360 --> 13:27.270
And it just so happens that
my friend Joy and I,

13:27.270 --> 13:30.500
we are in the helping people
business, right?

13:30.500 --> 13:31.870
- That's us.
We're here to help.

13:31.870 --> 13:33.110
- Who are they?

13:33.110 --> 13:34.510
- She's trying to
get out of a ticket.

13:34.510 --> 13:36.380
- No, I'm not, I promise.

13:36.380 --> 13:38.050
We really do want to help,

13:38.050 --> 13:39.950
and each minute we spend here

13:39.950 --> 13:43.320
is another minute that
Zeke is out there, lost.

13:47.050 --> 13:48.290
- Okay.

13:48.290 --> 13:49.360
- Great!

13:49.360 --> 13:50.920
Let's go find your brother.

13:56.430 --> 13:57.660
- I can't believe you were able

13:57.660 --> 14:00.430
to convince Annie
to go to lunch with you.

14:00.830 --> 14:02.840
That's a nice gesture.

14:02.840 --> 14:06.610
- Well, I'm trying to go beyond
just a gesture, actually.

14:06.610 --> 14:07.910
- What do you mean?

14:07.910 --> 14:09.310
- Well, I reached out
to an old friend of mine

14:09.310 --> 14:11.280
who publishes "Le Frairie"
here in Paris,

14:11.280 --> 14:13.810
and I got her an interview.

14:13.810 --> 14:16.980
- Wow, Simon, "Le Frairie"?
- Um, what is that?

14:16.980 --> 14:19.720
- It's like the "Vanity Fair"
of France, it's world-renowned.

14:19.720 --> 14:21.290
- Oh, that's awesome.

14:21.290 --> 14:23.290
- Yeah, maybe it'll get her
writing again, you know?

14:26.860 --> 14:28.430
Oh, it's Annie.

14:28.430 --> 14:30.260
Um...

14:30.260 --> 14:31.800
Change of plans,
she wants us to meet her

14:31.800 --> 14:33.930
at the University of Paris.

14:33.930 --> 14:35.370
She knows a professor there

14:35.370 --> 14:36.870
that might have a lead
on the Grenelles

14:36.870 --> 14:39.340
and why the God Account
might be leading us to them.

14:39.340 --> 14:40.510
- I've called all the places

14:40.510 --> 14:41.940
Zeke and wandered off to
in the past.

14:41.940 --> 14:43.480
They're going to call me
if he shows up.

14:43.480 --> 14:45.010
- He's wandered off before?

14:45.010 --> 14:46.950
- Yeah, it's been happening
more often lately.

14:46.950 --> 14:48.750
- He had his good days
and his bad.

14:48.750 --> 14:50.020
- How long has he
been living with you?

14:50.020 --> 14:51.480
- About a year.

14:51.480 --> 14:53.450
- The first six months
were manageable,

14:53.450 --> 14:55.490
but then I had to start working
from home to take care of him.

14:55.490 --> 14:57.390
Hasn't been easy.

14:57.390 --> 14:58.890
- Have you thought about
getting help,

14:58.890 --> 15:00.660
or putting him
in assisted living?

15:00.660 --> 15:01.800
- You mean send him away?

15:01.800 --> 15:03.530
He's my brother,
I won't do that.

15:03.530 --> 15:04.560
The truth is,

15:04.560 --> 15:06.430
the kind of places that could
really help Zeke,

15:06.430 --> 15:08.300
we can't afford--
they're just too expensive.

15:08.300 --> 15:10.000
- We can make it work,
Sarah, somehow.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.710
- We already tried everything!

15:15.810 --> 15:19.480
My parents are gone--Zeke's
the only family I have left.

15:19.480 --> 15:22.420
So I owe it to him now
to take care of him,

15:22.420 --> 15:24.380
and that's
what I'm gonna do.

15:26.520 --> 15:28.590
Hello?

15:28.590 --> 15:29.890
Yeah, hi Bruno.

15:29.890 --> 15:31.990
Okay.
We'll be right there.

15:31.990 --> 15:33.990
Thank you so much.

15:33.990 --> 15:35.330
Zeke!

15:35.330 --> 15:36.500
Oh, there you are!

15:36.500 --> 15:37.760
- Hey, buddy.

15:37.760 --> 15:40.400
- You okay, hon?

15:40.400 --> 15:43.570
- Uh, I'm waiting for Mom
to come and pick me up.

15:43.570 --> 15:48.410
- Oh, um, Mom asked me
to come instead.

15:48.410 --> 15:50.480
- Bruno, thanks for calling.
- You got it.

15:50.480 --> 15:52.010
- Come on.
Come on, Zeke, let's go.

15:52.010 --> 15:54.580
- Thanks for your help.

15:54.580 --> 15:56.550
- Thank you so much.

16:00.750 --> 16:03.320
- What do we do now?
Her brother has dementia.

16:03.320 --> 16:05.290
How are we supposed to help
with something like that?

16:05.290 --> 16:06.890
And don't say, "Call Miles."

16:06.890 --> 16:08.430
- Look,
just 'cause the God Account

16:08.430 --> 16:10.560
has never reached out to me,
you know, personally,

16:10.560 --> 16:12.300
doesn't mean that
I haven't worked on

16:12.300 --> 16:14.330
every single Friend Suggestion
he's ever had, right?

16:14.330 --> 16:15.540
- Okay, so what
do you suggest we do?

16:15.540 --> 16:16.570
- No idea.

16:18.840 --> 16:19.970
But...

16:19.970 --> 16:22.480
we know someone who might--
Ali.

16:22.480 --> 16:23.810
- Right.

16:23.810 --> 16:25.610
She's studying
to be a therapist,

16:25.610 --> 16:28.450
maybe she has some insight on
how we can help Sarah and Zeke.

16:28.450 --> 16:29.720
Not bad, Rakesh.

16:29.720 --> 16:31.550
- Thank you, Joy.

16:31.550 --> 16:33.520
- Well, from what
you're telling me,

16:33.520 --> 16:35.490
it sounds like you need
to figure out a way

16:35.490 --> 16:37.020
to get Sarah and her husband
some financial help

16:37.020 --> 16:38.490
to care for Zeke.

16:38.490 --> 16:40.590
- Yeah, but I don't know
where to start.

16:41.860 --> 16:43.960
- Hey, Dad!
Dad, this is Joy.

16:43.960 --> 16:45.730
She's working
on a Friend Suggestion.

16:45.730 --> 16:47.000
- Ah, Arthur Finer.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.640
So nice to finally meet you.

16:48.640 --> 16:50.300
- Same.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.740
- So, you've taken over
the God Account for Miles.

16:52.740 --> 16:53.770
Exciting.

16:53.770 --> 16:54.940
- That's one word for it.

16:56.610 --> 16:58.680
Well, if there's anything we
can do to help, just ask.

16:58.680 --> 17:00.410
- Actually, Dad,
don't you have a friend

17:00.410 --> 17:02.820
who works in the city
employee benefits office?

17:02.820 --> 17:03.920
- I do, why?

17:03.920 --> 17:05.550
- Because my Friend Suggestion

17:05.550 --> 17:07.550
is a traffic enforcement
officer

17:07.550 --> 17:10.560
and needs help getting her
brother into assisted living.

17:10.560 --> 17:12.990
- Well, the city has incredible
programs to help their workers.

17:12.990 --> 17:15.300
I would be happy
to put you touch with my friend

17:15.300 --> 17:16.760
to see if they can help.

17:16.760 --> 17:19.400
- Thanks!
That would be amazing!

17:21.770 --> 17:23.740
- Annie, this is Miles.

17:23.740 --> 17:25.410
- Hi, it's
a pleasure to meet you.

17:25.410 --> 17:27.970
- Nice to meet you,
I've heard so much about you.

17:27.970 --> 17:29.280
- Oh.

17:29.280 --> 17:30.640
- Uh, so, what'd you find out

17:30.640 --> 17:31.640
about the Grenelle family?

17:31.640 --> 17:32.950
- Well, it turns out

17:32.950 --> 17:34.750
that the gallery
we went to the other day

17:34.750 --> 17:37.720
with Paul Grenelle's work
is owned by his granddaughter,

17:37.720 --> 17:39.020
Audrey Grenelle.

17:39.020 --> 17:40.450
I didn't even know
she was in the art world.

17:40.450 --> 17:41.960
- Great, maybe
she'll have some answers.

17:41.960 --> 17:43.590
So, how do we get
a hold of her?

17:43.590 --> 17:45.290
- That's the thing,
she's a jet-setter.

17:45.290 --> 17:46.860
She's not even in
Paris right now.

17:46.860 --> 17:49.460
My friend Yves teaches in the
Art History department here

17:49.460 --> 17:50.960
and he knows Audrey Grenelle.

17:50.960 --> 17:52.800
So he said he had some
information for us,

17:52.800 --> 17:53.900
and asked us
to meet him here.

17:55.970 --> 17:57.740
- Oh, I'm sorry, it's Rakesh.
I'll be right back.

17:57.740 --> 17:58.740
- Yeah.

17:58.740 --> 18:00.410
- Hey, Rakesh, what's up?

18:00.410 --> 18:02.940
- Nothing much,
typical Monday.

18:02.940 --> 18:04.540
Joy got a new
Friend Suggestion,

18:04.540 --> 18:06.380
but you did not
hear that from me.

18:06.380 --> 18:08.210
- Okay, okay, who's it for?

18:08.210 --> 18:09.550
- Someone named Sarah Matthews,

18:09.550 --> 18:10.780
but that's not
why I called.

18:10.780 --> 18:13.290
I saw a text on Joy's phone

18:13.290 --> 18:15.520
that I wasn't really
supposed to see.

18:15.520 --> 18:16.790
- From who?

18:16.790 --> 18:18.530
- Illinois Bar Association?

18:18.530 --> 18:19.830
Something about
a hearing next week,

18:19.830 --> 18:21.490
but she won't talk about it,

18:21.490 --> 18:23.330
so I'm thinking maybe
I should do a little digging.

18:23.330 --> 18:24.660
- Look, if she's not ready
to talk about it,

18:24.660 --> 18:26.800
digging will only
make it worse.

18:26.800 --> 18:27.870
She'll open up
when she's ready.

18:27.870 --> 18:29.370
- Yeah, you're right.

18:29.370 --> 18:30.870
So, how are things
in Paris with Cara?

18:30.870 --> 18:32.340
- Good.

18:32.340 --> 18:33.770
I was about to tell her
I love her,

18:33.770 --> 18:35.480
but then the God Account
sent us a new clue.

18:35.480 --> 18:36.980
- Okay, so what's the clue
mean?

18:36.980 --> 18:38.580
- I don't know,

18:38.580 --> 18:40.650
but Cara's friend Annie
might have a new lead.

18:40.650 --> 18:43.980
- I appreciate the offer,
Simon, really.

18:43.980 --> 18:45.990
But "Le Frairie" is not for me.

18:45.990 --> 18:47.820
- Why not?

18:47.820 --> 18:50.660
- Because I'm not interested in
writing one-column fluff pieces

18:50.660 --> 18:53.690
and tacky
celebrity worship columns.

18:53.690 --> 18:55.630
- I get it, you know, I do.

18:55.630 --> 18:57.730
But Annie, it's a start.

18:57.730 --> 19:00.000
- The story that you killed
five years ago, Simon,

19:00.000 --> 19:02.800
was gonna put me on the map.

19:02.800 --> 19:04.370
Those stories, they come along

19:04.370 --> 19:05.810
once in a lifetime,
if you are lucky.

19:05.810 --> 19:08.740
So unless you can magically
somehow change the past,

19:08.740 --> 19:10.280
thank you, but no thank you.

19:11.780 --> 19:14.480
- Uh, hey,
is everything okay?

19:14.480 --> 19:16.580
- Yeah, fine.

19:17.680 --> 19:19.820
- Annie!

19:20.990 --> 19:22.560
So, thank you for meeting us.

19:22.560 --> 19:24.560
What did you find out
about Audrey Grenelle?

19:24.560 --> 19:25.530
- It turns out she has

19:25.530 --> 19:27.660
a private collection
on loan at the Louvre.

19:27.660 --> 19:28.860
- Who's the artist?

19:28.860 --> 19:30.500
- That's the thing,
there isn't one.

19:30.500 --> 19:34.500
The art was created
by artificial intelligence.

19:34.500 --> 19:37.370
The exhibit is called,
"The Future of Art".

19:37.370 --> 19:40.740
- The lock bridge leads
directly to the Louvre.

19:43.310 --> 19:44.940
- The bridge unlocks
your future.

19:58.860 --> 20:00.490
- Hey.

20:00.490 --> 20:01.960
You know we actually
have to go inside

20:01.960 --> 20:03.530
to see the exhibit, right?

20:03.530 --> 20:06.570
- I guess it's just
hitting me all at once.

20:06.570 --> 20:10.370
I mean, we're at one of the
greatest museums in the world

20:10.370 --> 20:12.010
because there is
something inside

20:12.010 --> 20:14.640
the God Account
wants me to see.

20:14.640 --> 20:17.880
Something, if you take
the clues literally...

20:17.880 --> 20:20.350
that's gonna show me
my future.

20:20.350 --> 20:22.620
- Hey...

20:22.620 --> 20:25.550
whatever we find inside,
we'll deal with it...

20:25.550 --> 20:28.290
together.

20:28.290 --> 20:30.890
Now come on, let's find out
what your future is.

20:37.700 --> 20:39.000
- Hey, is Sarah home?

20:39.000 --> 20:40.870
- Uh, she's at work.
What's going on?

20:40.870 --> 20:42.800
- I found some aid programs
that help city workers

20:42.800 --> 20:45.640
get their families into
assisted living facilities.

20:45.640 --> 20:47.640
- Sarah's already looked into
every possible option

20:47.640 --> 20:51.380
for finding Zeke a good place,
she never misses anything.

20:51.380 --> 20:53.010
Uh, my guess is
we didn't qualify.

20:53.010 --> 20:54.650
- But you do qualify.

20:54.650 --> 20:56.680
I spoke with someone
in the benefits department

20:56.680 --> 20:59.020
and she said that
Sarah never applied.

21:06.530 --> 21:08.660
- Unbelievable.

21:08.660 --> 21:10.630
- I'm sure she didn't know.

21:10.630 --> 21:11.860
- I'm sure she did.

21:13.330 --> 21:15.340
I can't believe
she would keep this from me,

21:15.340 --> 21:18.940
knowing that she had a chance
to get Zeke the help he needs.

21:21.640 --> 21:23.010
Thank you.

21:23.010 --> 21:24.880
I'll make sure she gets this.

21:36.860 --> 21:38.860
- Rakesh, call me back.

21:38.860 --> 21:41.030
I think we may have a problem.

21:49.770 --> 21:50.900
- Welcome to Zelda's.

21:50.900 --> 21:52.440
How can I help you?

21:52.440 --> 21:54.740
- Um, we were wondering

21:54.740 --> 21:56.910
if you knew a woman
named Sarah Matthews.

21:56.910 --> 21:58.040
- Sorry, no.

21:58.040 --> 21:59.710
- What about Zeke Ramos?

21:59.710 --> 22:00.710
- Never heard of him.

22:06.590 --> 22:08.320
- You wouldn't happen
to know how to fix

22:08.320 --> 22:09.820
a "Galactic Ninja"
arcade game, would you?

22:09.820 --> 22:11.320
- Uh--

22:11.320 --> 22:12.630
- What?
You told me to fix it.

22:12.630 --> 22:14.290
- I'm not familiar
with "Galactic Ninja",

22:14.290 --> 22:15.600
but there's someone here
who knows it well.

22:15.600 --> 22:17.930
Hey, Gary, can you
come out here for a sec?

22:19.770 --> 22:20.770
- Hi.

22:20.770 --> 22:22.270
- These two want to know

22:22.270 --> 22:23.770
how to fix
a "Galactic Ninja" stand-up.

22:23.770 --> 22:25.710
- Oh, "Galactic Ninja"!

22:25.710 --> 22:28.370
I haven't thought about
that game in years!

22:28.370 --> 22:30.280
Yeah, it was my favorite
as a kid.

22:30.280 --> 22:32.680
- Oh, yeah, mine too, man.
What a game, right?

22:32.680 --> 22:34.280
I bought it online

22:34.280 --> 22:36.620
but it just doesn't turn on
when I plug it in.

22:36.620 --> 22:38.920
- The fuse burns out
on those games a lot.

22:38.920 --> 22:40.420
That's probably your issue.

22:40.420 --> 22:42.890
Carl, can you grab
a two amp slow-blow fuse?

22:42.890 --> 22:44.690
Just open up
the back of the machine,

22:44.690 --> 22:47.590
pop the fuse in
right next to the AC input,

22:47.590 --> 22:48.760
you'll be right as rain.

22:48.760 --> 22:50.030
- Okay.
- Yeah, good luck.

22:50.030 --> 22:52.400
- Thank you!
- Yeah.

22:52.400 --> 22:55.330
- Looks like you got
your problem solved.

23:01.570 --> 23:04.680
The God Account doesn't
do anything by accident, right?

23:04.680 --> 23:05.880
So what am I missing?

23:05.880 --> 23:08.610
- Maybe this is about me
fixing my game.

23:08.610 --> 23:10.250
Like, the God Account's
doing me a solid

23:10.250 --> 23:11.880
for all my hard work.

23:13.950 --> 23:16.260
- No, it's definitely
about Sarah.

23:16.260 --> 23:17.460
- How can you be so sure?

23:17.460 --> 23:20.260
- Because she's standing
right there.

23:30.570 --> 23:32.970
- What are you two
doing here?

23:32.970 --> 23:33.970
- Is everything okay,
Sarah?

23:33.970 --> 23:35.110
- No, it's not.

23:35.110 --> 23:36.680
That was just Dan on the phone.

23:36.680 --> 23:38.240
He told me about
your little visit.

23:38.240 --> 23:39.650
- I was only trying to help.

23:39.650 --> 23:41.950
- Well, you made it worse.

23:41.950 --> 23:43.680
Dan's packing a bag

23:43.680 --> 23:45.850
and he said he's gonna
go stay with his sister.

23:45.850 --> 23:47.090
He says,

23:47.090 --> 23:49.060
"Either Zeke goes
into assisted living

23:49.060 --> 23:51.820
or our marriage is over."

23:51.820 --> 23:53.060
- Okay, you know what?

23:53.060 --> 23:54.860
Dan is right.

23:54.860 --> 23:56.500
- Excuse me?

23:56.500 --> 23:58.830
- You have the opportunity
to put Zeke into a great place

23:58.830 --> 24:00.230
where he can get the care
that he needs,

24:00.230 --> 24:03.140
and yet,
you are choosing not to

24:03.140 --> 24:05.910
at the cost
of your marriage--why?

24:05.910 --> 24:07.670
- None of your business.

24:10.010 --> 24:13.210
- You told me you love Zeke.

24:13.210 --> 24:15.820
Something deeper's
holding you back--what is it?

24:19.550 --> 24:21.190
- I ruined his life!

24:21.190 --> 24:23.520
Okay?

24:23.520 --> 24:25.520
- What do you mean?

24:26.860 --> 24:30.060
- When...

24:30.060 --> 24:34.030
when Zeke and I
were teenagers...

24:34.030 --> 24:37.670
I found out that he was gay.

24:37.670 --> 24:40.470
And it was a different time
back then, our--

24:40.470 --> 24:43.980
our parents were
very conservative.

24:43.980 --> 24:46.650
I was always a rule-follower.

24:47.850 --> 24:50.520
And...

24:50.520 --> 24:53.420
I thought it was the right
thing to do to tell them.

24:54.550 --> 24:57.760
I outed him,
I broke up our family,

24:57.760 --> 24:59.930
and...

24:59.930 --> 25:04.000
after that, they sent Zeke off
to boarding school, we...

25:04.000 --> 25:05.800
we never spoke again.

25:05.800 --> 25:07.170
And then he got sick.

25:07.170 --> 25:10.140
- You're taking care of Zeke
as penance.

25:13.510 --> 25:17.640
- It's the least
I can do for him.

25:19.080 --> 25:22.050
- You have to
forgive yourself, Sarah.

25:22.050 --> 25:25.580
For Zeke, for your marriage,
and most importantly,

25:25.580 --> 25:28.150
for you.

25:29.960 --> 25:32.490
- Can't.

25:32.490 --> 25:36.900
What's done is done,
and there's no changing that.

25:36.900 --> 25:39.530
Could you just please...

25:39.530 --> 25:42.200
just--just please
leave us alone?

25:48.910 --> 25:51.610
- The exhibits should be
around here somewhere.

25:51.610 --> 25:54.410
- Okay, it's just...that way.

25:59.080 --> 26:00.950
- Uh, excuse me, excuse me!

26:00.950 --> 26:02.820
Is there any way we could
take a look at the art?

26:02.820 --> 26:04.460
- Sorry, the exhibit's over.

26:04.460 --> 26:07.760
- I--please, please.
It is really important.

26:07.760 --> 26:09.500
- Everything's sealed up.

26:09.500 --> 26:11.160
- Well, do you know where
it's headed next?

26:11.160 --> 26:14.500
- It's not.
This was a one-time showing.

26:19.140 --> 26:20.710
- I don't understand.

26:20.710 --> 26:22.780
Those paintings are the only
way for us to figure out

26:22.780 --> 26:24.780
what the God Account
wants me to do next.

26:24.780 --> 26:26.850
I mean, how are we
supposed to see them now?

26:26.850 --> 26:28.050
- I don't know.

26:32.580 --> 26:34.920
- Wait, it doesn't
make any sense.

26:34.920 --> 26:36.590
Why would the God Account
send me all the way here

26:36.590 --> 26:38.090
if the exhibit is closed?

26:38.090 --> 26:39.260
- I don't know--maybe we got
the clue wrong.

26:39.260 --> 26:40.590
- No, no, no, no, no.

26:40.590 --> 26:42.190
There's something else
we're missing,

26:42.190 --> 26:44.600
something we're supposed
to do, I--

26:44.600 --> 26:48.000
I just have no idea
what it could be.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.600
- Um...

26:50.600 --> 26:54.040
I think I know.

26:54.040 --> 26:57.080
- You do?

26:57.080 --> 26:58.880
- Yeah...

26:58.880 --> 27:00.880
I don't think
the God Account sent you here

27:00.880 --> 27:03.120
just to solve its riddle.

27:04.850 --> 27:07.520
I think it sent you here...

27:07.520 --> 27:09.960
because I needed
to tell you something.

27:09.960 --> 27:12.520
- What are you talking about?

27:13.990 --> 27:15.890
- I didn't just come to Paris

27:15.890 --> 27:18.230
'cause it was
a great opportunity.

27:19.430 --> 27:21.470
I came...

27:21.470 --> 27:25.170
because it gave me
a chance to run.

27:25.170 --> 27:27.040
- Run from what?

27:27.040 --> 27:29.880
- The day that
I left for Paris

27:29.880 --> 27:32.340
you were gonna tell me
that you loved me.

27:32.340 --> 27:35.480
I told you not to...

27:35.480 --> 27:37.350
that if you did,
I wouldn't leave.

27:37.350 --> 27:38.520
- Yeah, I remember.

27:38.520 --> 27:40.320
- Yeah,

27:40.320 --> 27:44.260
that wasn't true, Miles.

27:44.260 --> 27:46.020
I didn't want you to say it

27:46.020 --> 27:49.030
because I wasn't gonna
say it back.

27:52.400 --> 27:53.900
- Well, why not?

27:53.900 --> 27:56.130
- Because I'm not ready.

27:56.130 --> 28:00.510
The last thing that my mom
and I said before she left was,

28:00.510 --> 28:03.140
"I love you."

28:03.140 --> 28:05.410
I thought after all this time
that I put it behind me,

28:05.410 --> 28:09.450
but I guess I'm just still that
little girl sitting on a bench

28:09.450 --> 28:12.920
waiting for her mom
to come home.

28:12.920 --> 28:14.020
It's...

28:14.020 --> 28:15.420
- Hey, no, babe--
- I'm sorry, Miles.

28:15.420 --> 28:18.320
- There's nothing
to be sorry about.

28:18.320 --> 28:21.230
Nothing.

28:21.230 --> 28:24.830
And if that is the reason the
God Account brought me here,

28:24.830 --> 28:27.430
then I'm glad.

28:27.430 --> 28:29.300
- You are?
- Yeah.

28:29.300 --> 28:32.500
I always want us
to be honest with each other.

28:32.500 --> 28:37.440
Because if we are, then I know
that we can survive anything.

28:47.450 --> 28:49.220
- Miles.

28:49.220 --> 28:51.390
Look.

28:51.390 --> 28:52.860
The Museum gift shop.

28:52.860 --> 28:55.330
They'll have prints
from the exhibit.

28:56.930 --> 28:59.460
- If you're right,
the answer's inside.

28:59.460 --> 29:00.470
Let's go.

29:09.010 --> 29:09.670
- Hi, excuse me.

29:09.670 --> 29:11.040
Do you have any more prints

29:11.040 --> 29:12.380
from the "Future of Art"
exhibit?

29:12.380 --> 29:14.010
- Mm-hmm, it's in the back.

29:14.010 --> 29:14.850
- Thank you.

29:21.250 --> 29:23.290
Okay, uh, where do we start?

29:23.290 --> 29:26.090
- Maybe scan the titles?
Could lead us in a direction.

29:26.090 --> 29:30.560
- I got "Tranquil",
"Unanswered", "Forbidden"...

29:30.560 --> 29:32.030
- "Reckoning" and "Erased".

29:34.330 --> 29:37.100
What?
- The path.

29:39.940 --> 29:41.870
Follow the lady,
find your path.

29:41.870 --> 29:43.780
- That's gotta be it.

29:44.980 --> 29:48.050
- Wait, this image is made
entirely out of binary code.

29:48.050 --> 29:50.380
Why did the God Account
want me to see this?

29:50.380 --> 29:53.590
- Maybe there's a message
hidden in the code.

29:55.920 --> 29:57.460
- We need to convince Sarah

29:57.460 --> 29:59.590
that she can still help Zeke
and save her marriage,

29:59.590 --> 30:01.030
but I don't know how.

30:01.030 --> 30:02.590
- Well, isn't that
what lawyers do?

30:02.590 --> 30:05.060
Make strong closing arguments?

30:05.060 --> 30:06.570
- Rakesh.

30:06.570 --> 30:08.200
- Look, you don't have to

30:08.200 --> 30:11.400
talk about the hearings
if you don't want to, but...

30:11.400 --> 30:13.000
as a friend,

30:13.000 --> 30:17.080
I just want you to know that
I'm always here to listen.

30:19.910 --> 30:22.610
- After I gave up
my daughter for adoption,

30:22.610 --> 30:24.080
I couldn't shake the feeling

30:24.080 --> 30:27.220
that maybe
I made the wrong decision.

30:27.220 --> 30:29.290
And I knew I could
never move on with my life

30:29.290 --> 30:32.260
unless I knew that
her life turned out okay.

30:32.260 --> 30:34.230
- Mm.

30:34.230 --> 30:37.430
- So, six months ago...

30:37.430 --> 30:41.000
I forged a subpoena
from a family court judge

30:41.000 --> 30:45.340
and I unsealed
her adoption records.

30:45.340 --> 30:47.240
It was the only way.

30:49.110 --> 30:51.540
And it was worth it.

30:51.540 --> 30:54.350
Because I found my daughter.

30:54.350 --> 30:58.220
I stood across the street
from her house, I--I...

30:58.220 --> 31:02.120
I saw her with her family
and she...

31:02.120 --> 31:04.190
looked happy.

31:06.360 --> 31:11.030
And in that moment I knew that
I made the right decision...

31:11.030 --> 31:13.870
no matter the consequences.

31:13.870 --> 31:15.330
- So you got...

31:15.330 --> 31:16.970
disbarred?

31:16.970 --> 31:19.200
- Well,
technically I was suspended.

31:19.200 --> 31:21.140
But that hearing...

31:21.140 --> 31:23.540
is about whether or not
I should be disbarred.

31:23.540 --> 31:25.580
- And you're going
to the hearing, right?

31:25.580 --> 31:28.610
- I was an officer of the court
and I violated that privilege.

31:28.610 --> 31:30.520
I was deceitful in my behavior,

31:30.520 --> 31:32.220
I don't deserve
to be reinstated.

31:32.220 --> 31:33.350
- Yes, but Joy,

31:33.350 --> 31:35.990
everyone deserves
a second chance.

31:35.990 --> 31:38.620
- You're right,
and I got mine...

31:38.620 --> 31:40.930
with the God Account.

31:42.990 --> 31:47.130
That's why I cannot fail
at this, too.

31:54.510 --> 31:57.240
- Bruno's pizza.

31:57.240 --> 31:59.910
- Yeah, sure, I can eat.

31:59.910 --> 32:02.110
- No, Rakesh, look, it's
a sticker for Bruno's Pizza.

32:02.110 --> 32:04.350
This is where--this is where
Zeke wandered off to.

32:04.350 --> 32:06.620
You said the game popped up
for sale on your Facebook feed.

32:06.620 --> 32:08.590
Maybe that wasn't
a coincidence.

32:08.590 --> 32:11.590
Put the fuse in--maybe this is
the answer we're looking for.

32:24.040 --> 32:26.000
- Ki-ya!

32:26.000 --> 32:27.240
Take me to your leader!

32:27.240 --> 32:28.470
- God, I love this.

32:33.350 --> 32:36.050
Wait, Zeke and Gary?

32:36.050 --> 32:38.220
Like, Gary from the game shop?

32:38.220 --> 32:39.350
- Gary said he used to

32:39.350 --> 32:41.090
play this game all the time
as a kid.

32:41.090 --> 32:43.020
This is why Zeke kept
going back to Bruno's.

32:43.020 --> 32:44.490
- He was looking for Gary.

32:44.490 --> 32:47.230
- This is what the God Account
was trying to tell us!

32:53.830 --> 32:55.730
- If this is about Zeke,

32:55.730 --> 32:57.600
I don't want to talk about it
anymore.

32:57.600 --> 33:00.570
- Okay, but there's someone
here you should listen to.

33:02.770 --> 33:04.580
- Hi, Sarah.

33:04.580 --> 33:06.710
I'm Gary Washburn.

33:06.710 --> 33:09.280
I was a friend of Zeke's.

33:09.280 --> 33:11.650
- I know exactly who you are.

33:11.650 --> 33:16.120
- Zeke and I used to meet at
Bruno's every day after school

33:16.120 --> 33:18.660
and play "Galactic Ninja"
for hours.

33:22.790 --> 33:25.330
We were best friends.

33:25.330 --> 33:27.800
And eventually...

33:27.800 --> 33:29.300
first loves.

33:31.470 --> 33:33.840
But then Zeke got
sent away to boarding school

33:33.840 --> 33:37.380
and a few years later,
we lost touch.

33:41.750 --> 33:45.150
- I'm so sorry, Gary, but...

33:45.150 --> 33:49.290
I'm the reason that Zeke
was sent to boarding school.

33:49.290 --> 33:53.090
I told my parents
about you two.

33:54.430 --> 33:55.530
- No, Sarah.

33:55.530 --> 33:59.330
You weren't the reason
your parents sent him away.

33:59.330 --> 34:03.600
Zeke came out to your parents
before you said anything.

34:03.600 --> 34:05.100
- How do you know that?

34:05.100 --> 34:07.440
- Because Zeke told me.

34:07.440 --> 34:10.780
He also said he didn't regret
coming out.

34:10.780 --> 34:13.240
He said that...

34:13.240 --> 34:16.650
telling your parents
his truth...

34:16.650 --> 34:20.520
was the best decision
he ever made.

34:24.290 --> 34:25.590
- All those years
we never spoke,

34:25.590 --> 34:27.560
I thought Zeke hated me.

34:27.560 --> 34:30.130
- No.

34:30.130 --> 34:33.060
- You didn't destroy
your family, Sarah.

34:36.330 --> 34:39.240
It's time to forgive
yourself.

34:46.110 --> 34:48.650
- Hey, hey, Rakesh.
How's the Friend Suggestion?

34:48.650 --> 34:49.810
- We did it, Miles!

34:49.810 --> 34:51.850
Well, technically Joy did,

34:51.850 --> 34:54.550
but I'm proud to say
I was a huge part.

34:54.550 --> 34:56.090
Mission accomplished.

34:56.090 --> 34:57.820
- All right, that's great,
I am proud of you guys.

34:57.820 --> 34:59.620
I can't wait for you
to fill me in when I get back.

34:59.620 --> 35:01.290
Now, in the meantime,

35:01.290 --> 35:03.490
I'm going to send you a print
that we found at the Louvre.

35:03.490 --> 35:05.660
We think it could be a message
from the God Account.

35:05.660 --> 35:08.370
It's made up of binary code.

35:08.370 --> 35:10.600
- Okay, say no more.
I'm all over it.

35:10.600 --> 35:11.640
- Okay.

35:11.640 --> 35:14.310
Uh, I gotta go.

35:14.310 --> 35:16.570
It's my last night
in Paris with Cara.

35:16.570 --> 35:18.540
I'll see you when I get back.

35:20.380 --> 35:22.450
- Well, I just got off
the phone with Annie

35:22.450 --> 35:24.080
and her friend Eve found out

35:24.080 --> 35:25.720
that Audrey Grenelle's
opening a new art gallery.

35:25.720 --> 35:27.090
- Where?

35:27.090 --> 35:29.420
- New York.

35:29.420 --> 35:30.660
- That's great!

35:30.660 --> 35:31.790
Okay, Rakesh and I
will head down there

35:31.790 --> 35:33.420
as soon as I get back.

35:33.420 --> 35:35.660
- Sounds good.

35:35.660 --> 35:38.000
- You okay?

35:39.360 --> 35:41.530
- Yeah, it's just...

35:41.530 --> 35:43.770
I forgot how much I miss this.

35:46.670 --> 35:48.670
- Me, too.

35:48.670 --> 35:51.680
But hey, we still have tonight,
right?

35:51.680 --> 35:54.450
- Yeah, we do.

35:57.420 --> 35:59.350
- We're here to see
"Galactic Ninja".

35:59.350 --> 36:00.550
- Come on in!

36:00.550 --> 36:01.850
It's right over there.

36:01.850 --> 36:03.290
Isn't she beautiful?

36:03.290 --> 36:05.560
- Look, Zeke.
You remember that game?

36:05.560 --> 36:07.290
Let's take a look.

36:15.130 --> 36:17.070
I got some news.

36:17.070 --> 36:21.010
Dan and I found
a great care facility for Zeke

36:21.010 --> 36:23.740
through the city program
that you found, Joy.

36:23.740 --> 36:25.610
- Yeah, it's 24 hours security

36:25.610 --> 36:28.880
and it's just a quick subway
ride from the house, so...

36:28.880 --> 36:31.620
we can visit him every day.

36:31.620 --> 36:34.190
- I'm really happy
to hear that.

36:34.190 --> 36:38.160
- I don't know why you were
so invested in my problem,

36:38.160 --> 36:40.490
but I'm grateful.

36:42.630 --> 36:44.260
- You're welcome!

36:45.930 --> 36:47.700
- Sarah.

36:49.930 --> 36:52.900
- Zeke?

36:58.010 --> 36:59.780
I've missed you.

37:01.080 --> 37:02.880
- I missed you, too.

37:05.250 --> 37:09.250
- I love this game.

37:09.250 --> 37:12.260
Can I play?

37:12.260 --> 37:14.930
- Of course, yeah!

37:18.700 --> 37:20.860
- Um...

37:20.860 --> 37:23.870
actually,
that's part of the reason

37:23.870 --> 37:25.740
why we asked you guys
to come down here,

37:25.740 --> 37:27.170
is 'cause Zeke should
have the game.

37:27.170 --> 37:29.110

as you want, now.

37:41.550 --> 37:43.820
Thank you, Rakesh.

37:46.990 --> 37:50.660
- Man, the Eiffel Tower
is beautiful at night.

37:50.660 --> 37:53.160
- Yeah, it really is.

37:56.630 --> 37:59.970
You know, I see why you
fell in love with this place.

38:02.040 --> 38:03.940
There's a magic to it.

38:09.110 --> 38:10.580

38:10.580 --> 38:13.580
I feel like there's been
something missing.

yet, and it's okay...

38:34.040 --> 38:37.610
because I'm not going anywhere.

38:37.610 --> 38:40.010
So take all the time you need.

38:59.900 --> 39:03.000
- Actually, I don't think
this is goodbye.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.640

39:04.640 --> 39:07.100
- I belong in New York, Miles.

Are you sure?

39:09.110 --> 39:10.810
What about Simon's book?

39:10.810 --> 39:14.240

40:02.930 --> 40:04.900
- Thank you.

for you to do the same.

40:11.240 --> 40:12.740
- No way.

40:12.740 --> 40:14.170
- Look Annie,
you said it yourself.

40:14.170 --> 40:16.910
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
story.

40:16.910 --> 40:19.140

say, Annie?

40:19.140 --> 40:20.780

I'm not interested

40:20.780 --> 40:23.180

your story of triumph.

40:23.180 --> 40:25.050
