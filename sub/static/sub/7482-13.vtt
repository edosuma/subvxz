WEBVTT

00:41.556 --> 00:43.615
You a pervert? That's my wife.

00:43.791 --> 00:46.191
- I saw cool shots. I'm a photographer.
- Give me the camera.

00:46.327 --> 00:48.327
You're out in public.
I'm allowed to take pictures.

00:48.496 --> 00:49.656
- All right, all right.
- Hey.

00:49.797 --> 00:52.630
Hey. Hey.

01:23.565 --> 01:25.397
Come on, pick up.

01:32.073 --> 01:33.199
What are you doing?

01:37.145 --> 01:39.341
No! God. Help!

02:14.849 --> 02:16.908
Is Deeks talking backwards?

02:19.454 --> 02:21.115
I'm gonna go
with demonic possession.

02:22.490 --> 02:23.514
You know what?

02:23.691 --> 02:26.023
- Screw this.
- Deeks?

02:26.194 --> 02:28.274
- What are you doing?
- I was trying to learn Danish,

02:28.429 --> 02:30.761
and now I'm no longer trying
to learn Danish.

02:30.932 --> 02:33.526
What you was trying to say is,
"Kan du tale lidt langsommere?”

02:33.701 --> 02:34.964
Wow. Thank you for that.

02:35.136 --> 02:37.264
Does anyone know
how to say "show-off" in Hebrew?

02:38.740 --> 02:39.900
No. You know what? Forget it.

02:40.041 --> 02:43.807
Just remind me to tell Nate about my
inferiority complex next time I see him.

02:43.978 --> 02:45.618
You really wanna learn
a foreign language?

02:45.747 --> 02:48.842
Well, I just figure that between
the two of you, Kensi and I and Hetty,

02:49.017 --> 02:50.985
we got like two dozen languages
covered.

02:51.152 --> 02:53.712
Since we've never arrested a terrorist
that speaks pig Latin...

02:53.888 --> 02:55.208
Not to say they're not out there.

02:55.356 --> 02:57.676
So you wanna augment
the team's skill set. Nice initiative.

02:57.825 --> 03:01.853
Well, you can tell me that again
after I learn how to speak Turkish.

03:05.366 --> 03:06.856
Scratch that. Ahem, Korean.

03:09.370 --> 03:11.498
- Really?
- Really.

03:12.006 --> 03:13.531
- French.
- Sérieux?

03:13.708 --> 03:15.428
Canadian.
I was gonna say "French Canadian."

03:15.576 --> 03:16.976
- There's a different dialect.
- Oh.

03:17.011 --> 03:19.844
You guys probably didn't know that.
Welsh.

03:23.918 --> 03:25.249
- You got us there.
- Ahh.

03:33.094 --> 03:34.118
Mr. Deeks.

03:36.798 --> 03:37.856
Gentlemen.

03:38.032 --> 03:40.160
Thank you for that.
Wow, this has been a pleasure.

03:40.335 --> 03:42.326
Ahem. Etective-day Eeks-day.

03:42.503 --> 03:45.029
Think you need to work
on your Korean there, big guy.

03:45.206 --> 03:46.901
- Why?
- Pretty sure you said:

03:47.075 --> 03:48.133
"I speak like honey."

03:48.309 --> 03:49.749
This coming from a guy
who told Deeks

03:49.911 --> 03:51.551
he looks like a frisky rodent,
in Turkish.

03:51.679 --> 03:53.670
- That was intentional.
- Yeah, right.

03:53.848 --> 03:56.647
L.A.P.D. found something at a
crime scene they'd like us to look at.

03:56.818 --> 04:00.550
Ah. You see, Deeks,
you have other skill sets.

04:00.722 --> 04:02.850
- Huh? Like liaising.
- Right.

04:03.024 --> 04:05.186
I always thought
it was pronounced "lazing."

04:07.161 --> 04:09.493
That's clever.
It's a play on words. I like it.

04:11.733 --> 04:13.167
Detective found this 20 feet away.

04:13.334 --> 04:16.099
Pulled their guys off
and called us immediately.

04:16.504 --> 04:19.666
ME already removed
what was left of the body.

04:20.074 --> 04:23.203
Gas tank alone
can't do this kind of damage.

04:23.411 --> 04:25.106
I'm thinking plastic explosives.

04:25.279 --> 04:26.747
Watermarks are destroyed.

04:27.482 --> 04:29.678
There's nothing to indicate
who this guy was.

04:30.485 --> 04:31.919
I got some Pashto.

04:32.387 --> 04:33.821
Maybe Deeks can translate.

04:33.988 --> 04:36.548
Ha, ha. That's hilarious.

04:37.492 --> 04:39.426
I got a camera.

04:39.594 --> 04:41.154
Might be a little crispy even for Eric.

04:47.268 --> 04:48.963
Challenge coin.

04:49.137 --> 04:51.071
Financial Crimes
Enforcement Network.

04:51.239 --> 04:52.638
- FinCEN?
- Never heard of them.

04:52.807 --> 04:54.969
They investigate organizations
for money laundering,

04:55.143 --> 04:56.838
financial ties to terrorism.

04:58.546 --> 05:00.605
- What do you got, Sam?
- Eric.

05:00.782 --> 05:03.376
Can you find out if FinCEN
has any agents in Los Angeles?

05:03.551 --> 05:05.076
- Checking.
- Mirza Rahman.

05:05.253 --> 05:06.277
Rafiq Shahidi.

05:06.454 --> 05:08.047
Might take a minute. Call you back?

05:08.222 --> 05:09.690
High-ranking Taliban commanders.

05:09.857 --> 05:11.120
Thanks.

05:11.426 --> 05:14.225
- So, what's the connection with L.A.?
- That's a good question.

05:16.798 --> 05:21.235
FinCEN currently only has one agent
in Los Angeles. Stuart Green.

05:21.402 --> 05:23.996
He flew into LAX
yesterday morning from Afghanistan.

05:24.172 --> 05:26.732
He was supposed to check in
with FinCEN last night.

05:26.908 --> 05:27.948
They never heard from him.

05:28.109 --> 05:31.238
His file says he was working
with a small team based in Kabul.

05:31.412 --> 05:33.312
Deep undercover
at Prince's Money Market

05:33.481 --> 05:34.915
investigating hawalas.

05:35.082 --> 05:37.050
You can never trust a koala, man.

05:37.218 --> 05:39.258
You never know what they're hiding
in their pouches.

05:39.387 --> 05:41.583
In fact, I won't turn my back
on any marsupial.

05:41.756 --> 05:42.780
- Hey.
- Hmm?

05:42.957 --> 05:44.982
It's "hawala."

05:45.159 --> 05:46.759
It's an ancient system
of money transfer.

05:46.928 --> 05:48.692
Western Union for the Muslim world.

05:48.863 --> 05:50.695
Cheap, fast, no ID required.

05:50.865 --> 05:52.629
Sounds like
a terrorist's dream come true.

05:52.800 --> 05:55.292
We need to contact the FinCEN team
in Kabul.

05:55.903 --> 05:57.632
That's not gonna be easy.

06:47.455 --> 06:49.287
We have a message from Mr. Green.

06:51.259 --> 06:53.125
Agents Kazimi, Farhad.

06:55.630 --> 06:57.462
- Who are you?
- We're friends.

06:58.666 --> 06:59.690
NCIS.

07:00.067 --> 07:02.348
Well, you'd better have
a damn good reason for being here.

07:02.503 --> 07:04.343
It's taken us four years
to build these covers.

07:04.505 --> 07:07.770
Believe me, we get it.

07:08.242 --> 07:10.074
We have some bad news
about Agent Green.

07:14.215 --> 07:17.378
Okay, we're just waiting for Kensi
and Granger to come online.

07:22.356 --> 07:24.518
- You all right, Deeks?
- Yeah. No, I just...

07:24.692 --> 07:27.525
I got this new shirt
and it's just, uh, super-itchy.

07:27.695 --> 07:30.255
I was just... I should've just
read the label before I put it on.

07:30.364 --> 07:32.059
I'm sure I was supposed
to wash it first.

07:32.233 --> 07:34.895
- But, no, I'm good.
- Okay, we're all set.

07:36.804 --> 07:38.533
Agents, detective.

07:38.706 --> 07:40.231
Good to see you, sir.

07:40.575 --> 07:41.599
Where's Kensi?

07:42.343 --> 07:44.437
Well, it's nice to see you too,
detective.

07:45.079 --> 07:49.778
I had Agent Blye stay behind in Kabul
to debrief FinCEN Agent Farhad.

07:50.351 --> 07:52.581
This is Agent Kazimi, his partner.

07:52.753 --> 07:55.552
Now, I don't have to tell you
he's here at great personal risk,

07:55.723 --> 07:56.781
so let's make this quick.

07:56.958 --> 07:59.427
Is it true? Green is dead?

08:00.094 --> 08:01.255
We're waiting for proper ID,

08:01.429 --> 08:04.729
but we confirmed that the car was
the same one he rented yesterday.

08:04.899 --> 08:07.231
What was Green doing so far
from Afghanistan?

08:07.401 --> 08:08.698
Trying to plug a leak.

08:08.869 --> 08:10.735
- Intel?
- Money.

08:10.905 --> 08:12.425
Specifically,
money funding IED attacks

08:12.573 --> 08:14.632
on Afghan and U.S. military targets.

08:14.809 --> 08:16.277
Taliban's handiwork.

08:16.444 --> 08:19.175
Agents Farhad and Kazimi
have traced the source of their money

08:19.347 --> 08:21.111
to a global hawala network.

08:21.415 --> 08:23.406
So you and Agent Farhad
went undercover

08:23.584 --> 08:25.211
to access hawala records.

08:25.386 --> 08:26.820
Green was our handler.

08:26.988 --> 08:28.547
Their most recent findings indicate

08:28.723 --> 08:32.421
the terrorists' money has been coming
from a hawala broker in Los Angeles.

08:32.592 --> 08:34.118
Green came here to find the broker.

08:34.294 --> 08:36.354
Maybe he found him,
that's what got him killed.

08:36.530 --> 08:39.556
Agents Blye and Farhad will send you
the hawala records within the hour.

08:39.734 --> 08:41.828
And until then, let's be clear.

08:42.003 --> 08:44.335
Someone in L.A.
is funding brutal attacks

08:44.505 --> 08:46.803
on Afghan
and U.S. military personnel,

08:46.974 --> 08:49.807
and now we've got
a dead federal agent.

08:49.977 --> 08:53.345
I want you to find the leak
and plug it with everything you've got.

08:54.482 --> 08:56.075
We're on it.

09:05.892 --> 09:07.326
We found Agent Green's rental

09:07.493 --> 09:09.723
on several traffic cameras
in Culver City last night.

09:09.896 --> 09:11.864
There's a lot of import-export shops
around there.

09:12.031 --> 09:13.897
Make it easy to keep hawala
under the radar.

09:14.067 --> 09:16.729
- Get anything off Green's camera?
- Ugh, mostly damaged data.

09:16.903 --> 09:19.497
But these two photos
are the best so far.

09:19.672 --> 09:22.505
Wow. I see two pixelated
Polynesian women paddle boarding.

09:22.675 --> 09:24.268
No. I see Kate Upton,

09:24.444 --> 09:26.204
and she's doing the Dougie
while in a bikini.

09:26.345 --> 09:31.442
More than four sexual references
in a ten-card Rorschach test

09:31.617 --> 09:34.382
is a strong indicator
for schizophrenia.

09:35.755 --> 09:37.519
That's funny.

09:38.357 --> 09:39.415
Okay, not funny.

09:39.592 --> 09:41.232
They look like
they could be rug patterns.

09:41.360 --> 09:43.260
They are. It's a Shindand design.

09:43.429 --> 09:47.024
Major export of Afghanistan.
I've brought home a few myself.

09:47.200 --> 09:50.864
There's only one Afghan rug store in
Culver City. It's down on La Cienega.

09:51.037 --> 09:52.300
Could be our hawala broker.

09:52.472 --> 09:54.236
Address on your phones.

09:55.108 --> 09:58.567
Okay, just to clarify, neither one of you
saw twins in that photo?

09:58.744 --> 10:00.143
- Blonds.
- I knew it.

10:00.646 --> 10:02.910
- You knew what?
- You just said "blonds."

10:03.082 --> 10:06.108
- He didn't say anything.
- I think you're hearing voices, Deeks.

10:06.285 --> 10:08.413
Maybe Hetty was right.

10:16.496 --> 10:17.657
Eric, is this the owner?

10:19.465 --> 10:21.126
That's him.
His name's Behnam Navid.

10:21.300 --> 10:23.530
He immigrated to this country
five years ago,

10:23.703 --> 10:26.035
opened up the store
three years later.

10:26.205 --> 10:29.175
That's right around the time
the IED attacks started happening

10:29.342 --> 10:30.434
in Afghanistan.

10:30.610 --> 10:32.908
We need to get inside and confirm.

10:33.079 --> 10:36.174
Well, then, I think it's time for Sven,

10:36.349 --> 10:38.681
fabulous interior decorator
to the stars.

10:39.051 --> 10:41.076
Knock yourself out.

10:41.287 --> 10:45.588
All right. But let's go easy
on the fabulous this time, okay?

10:46.893 --> 10:49.521
Okay, bring on the wonderful, yeah?

10:49.695 --> 10:51.663
- Look here.
- Okay.

10:51.831 --> 10:54.232
This is a Kazak design.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.198
- Kazak design, yeah.
- From Peshawar.

10:56.369 --> 10:59.930
Hand-knotted and plant-dyed.

11:00.106 --> 11:02.302
- Beautiful, yes?
- Yeah, yeah. It's okay, it's okay.

11:02.475 --> 11:04.705
The problem is the club
is 10,000 square feet.

11:04.877 --> 11:08.438
And what we need to do is cover
the entire lounge area with the rugs.

11:08.614 --> 11:10.548
Yeah, what do you think?
Is this fantastic?

11:11.184 --> 11:13.050
- I think it's a little big.
- Hmm.

11:13.219 --> 11:14.550
A little over the top.

11:14.720 --> 11:16.440
I've told you,
you can't be afraid of color.

11:16.589 --> 11:20.253
I've always said this to him.
You can't be scared of the color. Heh.

11:20.660 --> 11:24.062
- Color's the last thing I'm scared of.
- Okay. All right.

11:24.230 --> 11:27.222
Well, you don't want to be the boring
beige boy, now, do you, Chad? Huh?

11:28.668 --> 11:30.136
- Maybe.
- No, come on.

11:30.303 --> 11:32.271
No one wants
to be the boring beige boy.

11:34.740 --> 11:37.368
- Hey, Sven. Stop saying that.
- Huh?

11:37.543 --> 11:41.173
Yeah, but you don't want to be
the drab Danny, or the gray Gary.

11:41.347 --> 11:44.806
Remember, Chad,
you hired me to make you fabulous.

11:49.722 --> 11:53.556
Okay, that's Benham's son,
Ehsan Navid.

11:53.726 --> 11:55.888
He emigrated to the U.S.
with his father.

11:56.329 --> 11:58.991
Any contact with the hawala brokers
back in Afghanistan?

12:00.333 --> 12:03.166
Uh, looks like four or five calls
a day.

12:04.704 --> 12:08.834
The blues are so pretty
over here. They match my eyes.

12:12.678 --> 12:15.704
He's heading
out the side door and he's got a gun.

12:16.515 --> 12:17.778
All right, stay with him.

12:18.117 --> 12:20.176
Let's pick him up
when he's away from the store.

12:20.353 --> 12:22.685
Okay, I've seen enough. So long.

12:24.657 --> 12:26.455
Chad, where are you going?

12:26.626 --> 12:29.561
Yeah, I... I gotta get a new decorator.

12:29.895 --> 12:32.387
I completely understand.

12:45.011 --> 12:46.740
Where's he headed on foot?

12:46.912 --> 12:48.880
I'm more concerned about
what he's got in the bag.

12:51.784 --> 12:52.808
Think he made us.

12:52.985 --> 12:55.750
What are you talking about?
My character's bulletproof.

12:57.123 --> 12:58.955
I think he made us.

13:05.164 --> 13:07.064
Federal agents. Freeze.

13:07.600 --> 13:09.466
Drop the bag, get on your knees.

13:09.635 --> 13:11.296
Hands on your head.

13:13.339 --> 13:14.670
Are you guys really agents?

13:15.708 --> 13:18.268
I thought you were trying to rob me.

13:22.615 --> 13:24.709
Gun's not loaded.

13:24.950 --> 13:25.974
Duffel bag is.

13:32.191 --> 13:35.456
I don't understand.
Did I do something wrong?

13:35.628 --> 13:37.756
Carrying a concealed weapon
requires a permit.

13:37.930 --> 13:40.058
It's unloaded and broken.

13:40.232 --> 13:43.395
I just keep it to scare people
in case I'm robbed.

13:43.569 --> 13:44.968
Where were you going
with the cash?

13:45.137 --> 13:47.037
The bank.
It belongs to my customers.

13:47.206 --> 13:48.696
That's a lot of cash.

13:48.874 --> 13:51.206
Hawala business
must be doing pretty good.

13:51.377 --> 13:55.541
We treat your money
As if it were ours.

13:55.815 --> 13:56.839
It's our slogan.

13:57.616 --> 13:59.015
Your hawala has a slogan?

13:59.185 --> 14:03.645
Mm. And soon I hope to have ads
in coupon books and pennysavers.

14:07.093 --> 14:08.788
You seem to be real proud of it.

14:08.961 --> 14:11.487
Of course. It's an ancient system.

14:12.031 --> 14:16.628
Immigrants from many countries send
money back home with our service.

14:16.802 --> 14:19.032
It's how I send money back home
to Afghanistan.

14:19.205 --> 14:21.139
You still have family in Afghanistan?

14:21.307 --> 14:22.741
Two sisters and my mother.

14:23.976 --> 14:25.068
You would like to see them?

14:26.078 --> 14:28.479
- Sure.
- If I could have my tablet.

14:38.457 --> 14:40.391
They shot this for my father's birthday.

14:40.893 --> 14:42.418
I edited.

14:42.595 --> 14:44.586
Those are my sisters,
Armegan and Farah.

14:46.232 --> 14:47.256
And that's my mommy.

14:47.433 --> 14:49.902
Happy birthday.

14:50.069 --> 14:52.003
Happy birthday.

14:52.171 --> 14:54.003
Love you.

14:54.573 --> 14:57.338
Oh, I'm going to add
a spin transition here.

14:57.710 --> 14:59.974
We'll take a look at it later there,
Scorsese.

15:00.146 --> 15:01.511
It's just a rough cut.

15:02.715 --> 15:04.513
Do you know him?

15:04.950 --> 15:06.611
I think so.

15:06.919 --> 15:08.683
He was in the store looking at rugs.

15:10.689 --> 15:12.714
He's a federal agent.

15:12.892 --> 15:14.121
He was murdered last night.

15:16.662 --> 15:19.632
Did you know your hawala was being
used to send money to the Taliban?

15:19.799 --> 15:21.392
Impossible. I...

15:21.567 --> 15:23.228
I know the brokers in Afghanistan.

15:23.402 --> 15:25.734
They would not do business
with the Taliban.

15:25.905 --> 15:28.397
How would they know? Hawala's
completely anonymous, right?

15:28.574 --> 15:31.544
No names, just remittance codes.

15:32.445 --> 15:35.437
I'm trying to become a U.S. citizen.

15:36.348 --> 15:39.283
This is going to destroy
everything I've worked for.

15:43.122 --> 15:45.454
Maybe not.
But if we're gonna help you,

15:45.624 --> 15:48.025
we're gonna need access
to your transaction records.

15:48.194 --> 15:49.719
Yes, of course.

15:49.895 --> 15:52.830
I'll need my tablet. It's on the app.

15:52.998 --> 15:56.400
You have an app
for an ancient money-transfer system?

15:56.569 --> 16:00.563
Yeah. There's an app for everything.

16:05.845 --> 16:07.006
He sounds genuine.

16:07.179 --> 16:09.409
He and his father assisted
U.S. forces in the war,

16:09.582 --> 16:10.862
that's how they got their visas.

16:11.016 --> 16:14.179
And he just took the U.S. citizen's test,
passed with flying colors.

16:14.353 --> 16:16.993
Becoming a citizen will help him
bring over the rest of his family.

16:17.156 --> 16:19.124
It's safe to say he's not a killer
or a terrorist.

16:19.291 --> 16:21.817
Well, according
to his Facebook profile,

16:22.194 --> 16:25.357
he is an entrepreneur
with the soul of a dancer.

16:26.031 --> 16:27.328
And a hopeless romantic.

16:28.033 --> 16:30.559
And back on planet Relevance.

16:30.736 --> 16:34.195
Ehsan's hawala records
don't list any names,

16:34.373 --> 16:36.273
only remittance codes.

16:36.442 --> 16:39.207
And comparing the codes
from the L.A. and Afghan brokers,

16:39.378 --> 16:40.539
Agents Farhad and Kazimi

16:40.713 --> 16:44.274
were able to trace the money from L.A.
to a doctor in Kabul.

16:44.450 --> 16:49.012
He works at a quarantined
tuberculosis clinic in Parwan province.

16:49.688 --> 16:52.214
That's not far
from where Kensi's stationed.

16:52.391 --> 16:54.120
Does her head have to zoom so big?

16:54.293 --> 16:57.752
I'll have Granger and Miss Blye
look into it.

16:57.930 --> 17:00.365
And, yes, Mr. Deeks.

17:00.533 --> 17:03.901
My head does need
to zoom in this big.

17:04.069 --> 17:06.401
- It gives me power.
- Heh.

17:06.972 --> 17:08.701
Okay.

17:09.141 --> 17:11.337
Records indicate
that the TB clinic is being funded

17:11.510 --> 17:14.638
by a top-rated American charity,
Planet MD.

17:14.813 --> 17:16.541
They do good work
sending medical aid

17:16.714 --> 17:18.240
to hot spots around the globe.

17:19.251 --> 17:20.931
Somebody could have
infiltrated the charity

17:21.086 --> 17:22.952
and directed donor dollars
towards terrorism.

17:23.122 --> 17:25.682
And Green catches him at the hawala
and gets himself killed.

17:26.090 --> 17:27.148
Hey, guys,

17:27.526 --> 17:30.359
Planet MD has a fund-raiser
scheduled for tonight in Hollywood.

17:30.529 --> 17:32.769
Could be our best chance
to find the source of the money.

17:32.932 --> 17:34.229
Hawala system is anonymous.

17:34.400 --> 17:36.095
How do we know
who we're looking for?

17:37.236 --> 17:39.204
Zoom in on him.

17:40.105 --> 17:41.436
What is he doing?

17:41.607 --> 17:43.575
He's getting his groove on.

17:45.477 --> 17:49.209
Oh, my God,
he has no idea there's a camera on.

17:49.615 --> 17:51.049
Nope.

17:51.850 --> 17:53.784
And he's how we're gonna
make an ID.

17:56.689 --> 17:58.453
- Deeks?
- Huh?

17:58.624 --> 17:59.921
Meet your new partner.

18:13.838 --> 18:17.832
Vibrant. Sepia. Noir.

18:18.009 --> 18:20.842
You look so good
you don't even need a filter.

18:21.112 --> 18:25.515
Oh, Mr. Deeks, I'd like to remind you
that you're going undercover.

18:26.217 --> 18:30.450
I'd better not find that selfie
on your Instagram.

18:31.155 --> 18:33.089
Wait a minute.
You follow my Instagram?

18:33.257 --> 18:36.318
Yes. And if I have to look
at one more picture

18:36.494 --> 18:38.826
of Monty in his sunglasses,

18:38.996 --> 18:41.522
I'm gonna have Eric
crash the account.

18:41.699 --> 18:43.326
Check. Selfie gone.

18:45.669 --> 18:46.966
How you doing, Ehsan?

18:48.105 --> 18:51.200
Oh, Mr. Navid is in good hands.

18:51.375 --> 18:54.106
Yes. So do you do this often?

18:54.278 --> 18:56.269
- Go undercover?
- Not with civilians.

18:56.447 --> 18:58.347
I usually go undercover
with my partner.

18:58.516 --> 18:59.847
Did something happen to him?

19:00.017 --> 19:01.712
Did he die undercover perhaps?

19:01.886 --> 19:03.854
Okay, first off, he is a she...

19:04.021 --> 19:05.147
Did she die?

19:05.322 --> 19:08.053
No, nobody... Heh, nobody died.

19:08.626 --> 19:10.594
Right. Good.

19:10.761 --> 19:11.990
Then where is she?

19:14.131 --> 19:16.099
That's a damn good question.
Hetty?

19:16.267 --> 19:18.361
Mr. Navid,
why don't you go take a look?

19:19.970 --> 19:21.165
Get out here.

19:31.615 --> 19:33.242
Indeed.

19:33.784 --> 19:35.513
- Aah.
- Are you blushing, Hetty?

19:35.686 --> 19:37.450
No, reminiscing.

19:37.621 --> 19:40.921
Just reminiscing, Mr. Deeks.

19:43.060 --> 19:44.960
That's Callen.

19:45.663 --> 19:46.789
That means we gotta go.

19:46.964 --> 19:49.490
Don't be nervous, Mr. Navid.

19:49.667 --> 19:52.432
You've got the best looking after you.

19:54.939 --> 19:57.533
- Best looking.
- Mm.

19:57.708 --> 19:59.039
- You ready?
- Yes.

20:02.146 --> 20:03.875
Mr. Deeks.

20:04.048 --> 20:05.209
Yeah?

20:05.916 --> 20:07.884
Keep him safe.

20:09.987 --> 20:11.785
Of course.

20:15.993 --> 20:17.586
Okay, you're all set.

20:17.761 --> 20:19.661
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

20:19.830 --> 20:21.355
Glad you could join us,
Mr. Lopakhin.

20:21.532 --> 20:23.432
Is "Dr." Lopakhin.

20:23.601 --> 20:25.262
Did not just spend
the last six months

20:25.436 --> 20:27.928
working in leper colony
to be called "mister."

20:28.105 --> 20:31.234
Is brutal contagious disease.

20:31.408 --> 20:33.968
Okay, well, you are all set. Enjoy.

20:34.879 --> 20:37.712
Oh, and don't forget your gift bag
on the way out.

20:37.882 --> 20:39.762
Nice backstop.
Should give you space to operate.

20:39.917 --> 20:41.681
Anyone interesting yet?

20:41.852 --> 20:44.549
Uh, no. Eric's still running faces,
but it's gonna take some time.

20:44.722 --> 20:46.781
Yes?

20:49.493 --> 20:51.291
I'm in, Deeks. Where are you?

20:51.595 --> 20:53.859
Just follow the quinoa dumplings.

20:54.031 --> 20:56.159
Ehsan got over his nerves
pretty fast.

20:57.001 --> 20:58.628
Keep him focused, Deeks.

20:59.203 --> 21:00.883
Sorry, guys,
I'm gonna have to cut him off.

21:01.038 --> 21:03.278
- Have you tried this?
- Yeah, they, uh... They're great.

21:03.374 --> 21:06.901
But listen, I need you to, uh,
keep your head in the game, all right?

21:07.077 --> 21:08.477
We're here to find
hawala customers.

21:08.612 --> 21:09.636
- Of course.
- Of course.

21:09.813 --> 21:11.781
- I'm sorry, Marty.
- Okay. Just, uh,

21:11.949 --> 21:15.078
focus on the faces,
follow my lead. You got it?

21:16.020 --> 21:17.044
- Excuse me.
- Ooh.

21:19.490 --> 21:22.460
- Hello, ladies.
- Hello, ladies.

21:22.626 --> 21:24.458
- God bless America.
- Hey.

21:25.296 --> 21:27.628
- Deeks.
- Ehsan.

21:27.798 --> 21:31.735
Ahem. Just the faces, Romeo.
Just the faces.

21:38.943 --> 21:42.004
- Status, Mr. Hanna?
- They're in position.

21:42.179 --> 21:43.442
Kensi, what do you see?

21:43.614 --> 21:45.708
No activity
around the perimeter of the clinic.

21:46.417 --> 21:48.283
Windows are boarded up
so I can't see inside.

21:48.452 --> 21:50.750
That's the way terrorists like it.

21:52.323 --> 21:55.190
- Are you ready to breach?
- Locked and loaded.

22:00.831 --> 22:03.630
Walls are too thick for a clean read.

22:03.801 --> 22:06.998
Infrared's picking up sporadic
signatures. Somebody's home.

22:07.538 --> 22:09.097
The question is how many?

22:09.273 --> 22:12.208
And are they doctors or terrorists?

22:12.376 --> 22:16.313
If we're not careful, a Marine fire team
invading a medical clinic...

22:16.480 --> 22:18.414
Could end very badly.

22:18.582 --> 22:20.710
Might even trigger a backlash
of local tribes.

22:20.884 --> 22:22.079
That's if it's a TB clinic.

22:22.253 --> 22:25.223
If it's not and we do nothing,
more soldiers die in attacks.

22:25.389 --> 22:26.686
It's my call, Henrietta.

22:26.857 --> 22:28.552
Of course, Owen.

22:30.394 --> 22:31.725
So, what's your decision?

22:33.664 --> 22:35.462
We're going in.

22:35.966 --> 22:38.799
Note to self, don't shoot any doctors.

22:38.969 --> 22:40.528
Gas masks on.

22:40.704 --> 22:42.001
I don't wanna catch anything.

22:42.172 --> 22:43.901
Okay, let's move into position.

22:44.575 --> 22:45.701
You speak Pashto, right?

22:45.876 --> 22:48.470
Yes. And Arabic and English,
of course,

22:48.646 --> 22:50.808
and a little Dari for business.

22:50.981 --> 22:53.040
I'm surrounded by polyglots.

22:53.217 --> 22:55.049
I'm sorry?

22:55.219 --> 22:57.711
Uh, polygons. The... The geometry.

22:57.888 --> 23:01.882
I was just noticing and appreciating
how remarkable this photo is.

23:02.059 --> 23:04.494
- You like it?
- I love it.

23:04.662 --> 23:08.030
It was taken by a nurse who works
at our clinic in the West Bank.

23:09.400 --> 23:10.834
Only $5,000.

23:11.001 --> 23:14.960
Five-thousand dollars.
Well, it's going to a good cause, right?

23:15.272 --> 23:18.572
It's okay. You don't have to pretend
to like the art.

23:18.742 --> 23:20.335
Excuse me?

23:20.511 --> 23:24.209
Anna Chang.
Executive director, Planet MD.

23:24.381 --> 23:27.442
It's obvious you two
are more interested in the celebrities.

23:27.785 --> 23:30.777
Heads up, Deeks.
You've been flagged by security.

23:30.954 --> 23:34.515
I don't take kindly to paparazzi
crashing my fundraisers.

23:34.692 --> 23:36.492
I'm sorry,
there must be some sort of mistake.

23:36.627 --> 23:39.062
Miss Chang, if you look at the list,
our names are on it.

23:39.229 --> 23:41.857
Added at the last minute
and not approved by me.

23:42.032 --> 23:43.329
That's a red flag.

23:43.701 --> 23:47.535
Now, are you going to leave, or am I
going to have to make you leave?

23:47.705 --> 23:50.697
- I'm going in.
- Uh, excuse me, Miss Chang.

23:51.275 --> 23:54.301
You have a clinic near Bamyan.
Yes?

23:54.478 --> 23:56.606
Afghanistan? We do.

23:56.780 --> 23:58.942
That is where my family is from.

23:59.116 --> 24:01.881
My youngest sister, Farah,

24:02.519 --> 24:05.614
she had cholera
when she was just a baby.

24:05.789 --> 24:08.053
We all thought she might die.

24:08.258 --> 24:10.989
But then your doctors came
and she got better.

24:11.362 --> 24:14.024
I have no money
to give to your charity.

24:14.198 --> 24:17.293
What I earn goes to them.

24:18.001 --> 24:22.029
But I would like to offer you
my thanks.

24:24.808 --> 24:26.537
I'm glad your sister is well.

24:26.977 --> 24:29.708
Please, enjoy the evening.

24:30.781 --> 24:31.805
Both of you.

24:31.982 --> 24:33.814
Thank you so much.
It's nice to meet you.

24:36.920 --> 24:40.550
Just to be clear,
we had that under control, but, uh,

24:40.724 --> 24:42.590
you did good.

24:44.628 --> 24:45.720
You recognize somebody?

24:45.896 --> 24:50.026
Uh, yes. He comes into the hawala
twice a month.

24:51.168 --> 24:52.533
Eric, we got our guy.

24:53.904 --> 24:56.134
Bow tie, gray suit.

25:01.378 --> 25:04.109
I got him. His name is Roger Ali.

25:04.548 --> 25:07.711
He works for an outside finance
company that handles Planet MD.

25:07.885 --> 25:11.014
He's in charge of dispensing funds
to overseas clinics,

25:11.188 --> 25:13.418
including the TB clinic
in Afghanistan.

25:13.590 --> 25:15.285
We have confirmation.

25:15.626 --> 25:18.357
Mr. Callen, take Ali alive.

25:18.529 --> 25:20.691
Quietly and discreetly.

25:22.065 --> 25:23.145
Roger, I'm a federal agent.

25:23.300 --> 25:25.268
Don't turn around,
just walk to the front door.

25:28.605 --> 25:31.597
I am doctor.
This man have allergic reaction.

25:31.775 --> 25:32.970
He needs hospital.

25:33.143 --> 25:35.077
Please, help me bring to my car.

25:36.447 --> 25:38.438
That was discreet.

25:38.615 --> 25:40.549
Oh, bugger.

25:40.717 --> 25:42.412
They're about to breach.

25:42.586 --> 25:45.248
Three, two, one.

25:51.094 --> 25:52.960
- Clear.
- Anything inside?

25:53.897 --> 25:56.491
No medicines,
no equipment, no patients.

26:00.170 --> 26:01.729
Well, then I guess no TB.

26:01.905 --> 26:04.272
Something tells me
these guys aren't doctors.

26:10.647 --> 26:12.843
I got C-4.

26:13.016 --> 26:16.179
I got timers, detonators, pipe bombs.
Hetty, you seeing this?

26:16.487 --> 26:18.819
I'm afraid we are, Miss Blye.

26:31.100 --> 26:34.434
Okay, last chance.

26:34.603 --> 26:36.401
No games, no threats.

26:38.407 --> 26:43.174
- Your American passport is a fake.
- Your real name is Mujtaba Abdali.

26:43.879 --> 26:45.369
You graduated with a degree

26:45.548 --> 26:47.516
in accounting and English
from Kabul University.

26:47.683 --> 26:49.014
And for the past few years,

26:49.185 --> 26:52.052
you've been skimming money from
Planet MD to pay for Taliban attacks.

26:53.322 --> 26:55.654
I was sending funds
to medical clinics.

26:55.825 --> 26:58.453
You can't convict me of anything.

27:01.864 --> 27:03.730
What about murder?

27:05.501 --> 27:07.060
You think we'd get you on that?

27:08.838 --> 27:11.102
I have no idea who that is.

27:11.273 --> 27:13.435
Choice is yours.

27:13.609 --> 27:15.407
You can talk,

27:15.978 --> 27:17.503
or Guantanamo.

27:21.717 --> 27:22.946
Bring on your prison.

27:23.819 --> 27:27.187
Bring on your isolation,
your water boards.

27:27.356 --> 27:29.256
I have no fear.

27:29.425 --> 27:31.757
Allah is with me.

27:37.833 --> 27:39.673
Eric, I'm sending you
the second one right now.

27:39.835 --> 27:41.530
See if facial rec gets anything.

27:41.704 --> 27:43.832
I'll take care of it. I'm running it now.

27:59.021 --> 28:00.989
- Agent Blye.
- Yeah?

28:02.158 --> 28:04.320
Let's take a look at this.

28:11.233 --> 28:13.668
Okay, nice and easy.

28:14.837 --> 28:16.498
Yeah.

28:21.110 --> 28:25.411
Okay. No visible triggering device.

28:32.955 --> 28:36.653
- Get your EOD team in here now.
- Sir.

28:41.664 --> 28:44.326
Cell-phone receivers
and detonators for bombs.

28:45.234 --> 28:47.703
Seems to be where the attacks
were supplied and planned.

28:47.870 --> 28:51.465
There's a couple hundred pounds
of C-4. These are definitely the guys.

28:51.640 --> 28:54.075
Hold that perimeter, soldier.

28:57.313 --> 28:59.008
What do we have here?

29:04.687 --> 29:08.646
Well, my Pashto is rudimentary,
but this is definitely a ledger.

29:09.191 --> 29:11.956
And these look like hawala codes.

29:14.630 --> 29:17.861
Okay, we just cut off
the blood supply.

29:18.300 --> 29:19.825
I wanna cut off the head.

29:20.135 --> 29:23.628
I'll get this to the FinCEN agents,
see what they make of it.

29:31.914 --> 29:33.939
Ali was only trained to do one thing.

29:34.116 --> 29:36.050
Move money.

29:36.719 --> 29:38.050
Doesn't mean he's not our killer.

29:38.220 --> 29:40.655
Okay, so, uh, we got
a little bit of a problem.

29:40.823 --> 29:43.190
Ehsan here is refusing
to give back the suit.

29:43.359 --> 29:45.953
I'm not refusing. It is a request.

29:46.128 --> 29:48.256
- No way. Get changed.
- No, no, hold on a second.

29:48.430 --> 29:50.023
He says it's for a girl.

29:50.199 --> 29:51.860
I don't care if it's for the president.

29:52.034 --> 29:53.661
She's not just a girl.

29:53.836 --> 29:57.295
She is a dream.
An angel on this earth.

29:57.473 --> 29:59.999
You'll be an angel in heaven
if Hetty finds out.

30:00.175 --> 30:02.255
For her, I am willing
to take that chance. Look here.

30:02.411 --> 30:05.381
- I don't care what she looks like.
- She's not just a pretty face.

30:05.547 --> 30:08.039
She's kind, funny,

30:08.884 --> 30:10.750
and she loves to play
Madden football.

30:12.354 --> 30:14.755
- That is kind of awesome.
- There's no way.

30:14.924 --> 30:18.485
In this suit, she would see
who I could be.

30:18.661 --> 30:21.153
Please. Just for one night.

30:21.330 --> 30:23.196
Well, she is a stone-cold fox.

30:23.365 --> 30:25.094
Really? We're gonna lose our jobs

30:25.267 --> 30:28.259
over a pretty girl
that plays computer football?

30:31.740 --> 30:32.901
It's only for one night.

30:33.075 --> 30:36.739
Yeah, come on, G-man, it's for love.
The kid's in love.

30:36.912 --> 30:41.440
Look, if we do this,
it is never, ever spoken of again.

30:41.617 --> 30:44.780
- Suit? What suit?
- It's a pact we'll take to the grave.

30:46.221 --> 30:47.261
Get your hand in here too.

30:48.390 --> 30:49.414
Till death.

30:49.591 --> 30:51.559
Which may come quicker
if Hetty finds out.

30:51.727 --> 30:54.492
- Make us proud, Ehsan.
- Yeah.

30:55.097 --> 30:56.656
Let's move from Supply.

30:56.832 --> 30:59.392
- Kensi, they're coming on.
- Yeah. Give me a second.

31:00.369 --> 31:02.963
- Kensi, let's go.
- Okay, okay, okay.

31:07.977 --> 31:09.240
Sorry.

31:10.980 --> 31:14.109
- What are you doing?
- I have helmet hair.

31:14.283 --> 31:17.048
When you wear a helmet for too long,
it just kind of...

31:17.886 --> 31:18.944
Makes it awkward.

31:21.223 --> 31:22.418
I wouldn't know about that.

31:24.626 --> 31:25.650
Hi.

31:25.828 --> 31:28.354
- Hey, it's good to see you guys.
- You're missed.

31:28.530 --> 31:30.430
- Hey, Kens.
- Where's Deeks?

31:30.599 --> 31:32.590
Uh, he's with a witness.

31:34.903 --> 31:35.995
Tell him I said hi.

31:38.273 --> 31:39.468
Agent Kazimi.

31:40.009 --> 31:43.445
I've got bad news.
We've analyzed the ledger you found.

31:43.612 --> 31:46.104
The transactions match up
with the hawala in Los Angeles.

31:46.281 --> 31:48.321
We secured the source of the money.
He's in custody.

31:48.350 --> 31:51.047
Good. But we've got
a bigger problem.

31:51.520 --> 31:53.614
The ledger indicates
payment going the other way.

31:53.789 --> 31:56.815
From the hawala in Afghanistan
to the hawala in Los Angeles?

31:56.992 --> 31:59.859
- Yes.
- Why are they sending money back?

32:00.963 --> 32:02.988
The money goes
where the resources are needed.

32:03.165 --> 32:06.328
- The money's coming back because...
- Because there's gonna be an attack.

32:06.502 --> 32:09.870
It's been flowing that way
for the last 18 months.

32:10.039 --> 32:12.667
So there's a cell in Los Angeles.

32:13.142 --> 32:15.076
It gets worse.

32:15.244 --> 32:17.406
Monday was the last
scheduled payment.

32:18.614 --> 32:21.413
The money stopping
can only mean two things.

32:21.583 --> 32:25.315
The mission's no longer viable,
or it's about to go down.

32:25.487 --> 32:29.185
All right, alert Homeland Security
and the FBI.

32:29.625 --> 32:31.491
You have intel
on who you're looking for?

32:32.027 --> 32:36.658
Because of hawala's anonymity,
we don't have a clue.

32:46.841 --> 32:48.434
All right, let's go over it again.

32:48.609 --> 32:50.907
So we got a terrorist cell
operating in Los Angeles,

32:51.078 --> 32:55.174
receiving funds for the last 18 months
at $6,000 a month. I mean, that's...

32:55.349 --> 32:56.373
It's over 100 grand.

32:56.550 --> 32:58.990
It's not expensive to build a bomb,
it's the day-to-day costs.

32:59.119 --> 33:00.780
It's the housing and the food.

33:00.955 --> 33:02.650
They've been planning this a while.

33:02.823 --> 33:04.621
Ali's still not talking.

33:04.792 --> 33:07.659
- What about you two? Anything?
- Nada.

33:10.831 --> 33:13.528
- You don't have to rub it in.
- Report's back from the crash scene.

33:13.701 --> 33:16.898
The explosive used
to kill Agent Green was C-4.

33:17.071 --> 33:19.665
Okay, so we know they're bombers.
What's the target?

33:20.574 --> 33:21.803
I think I know.

33:21.976 --> 33:23.816
I was able to reconstruct
one of Green's photos

33:23.978 --> 33:27.676
enough to make out this black van
with a replaced gray door.

33:27.848 --> 33:29.475
I ran that feature
through Kaleidoscope

33:29.650 --> 33:32.847
and I found one a block away from
the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium.

33:33.020 --> 33:35.489
In 30 minutes,
there's a naturalization ceremony.

33:35.656 --> 33:38.990
Mass casualties, symbolic value.
That's the target.

33:39.159 --> 33:41.685
- Is it too late to cancel?
- People are already moving inside.

33:42.129 --> 33:44.154
How many new citizens?

33:44.331 --> 33:46.129
Twelve hundred.

33:47.001 --> 33:49.470
And we only have one way
to ID the bomber.

33:49.637 --> 33:53.631
Just traced Ehsan's cell.
He's at Goose Egg Café on Lincoln.

33:53.807 --> 33:56.037
I'll go pick him up. Meet you there.

34:01.549 --> 34:02.948
- Ehsan?
- Marty.

34:03.117 --> 34:05.313
Hey, I'm so sorry to interrupt.
We need you...

34:05.486 --> 34:09.217
Wow, you are even more beautiful
in person. Well-done.

34:09.389 --> 34:11.916
Ehsan, who is this?
What is going on?

34:12.092 --> 34:15.322
Ehsan, I really need to talk to you.
I'm so sorry.

34:15.496 --> 34:17.293
Excuse me.

34:22.536 --> 34:24.333
We need you
to ID another customer.

34:24.772 --> 34:26.532
- Of course, no problem.
- This is different.

34:26.674 --> 34:28.634
This guy is carrying
a large amount of explosives.

34:28.775 --> 34:32.371
He could detonate them at anytime,
which means this is your choice.

34:37.885 --> 34:40.353
I understand, Marty. Let's go.

34:40.521 --> 34:42.717
- You sure?
- Mm.

34:43.090 --> 34:44.784
- My country needs me.
- Call me.

34:52.833 --> 34:56.599
Sam, we're inside.
Ehsan's got the earwig.

34:56.770 --> 34:57.794
I see you.

34:57.972 --> 34:59.531
Callen's already on overwatch.

34:59.707 --> 35:04.042
Ehsan, check as many faces
as you can, as fast as you can.

35:04.578 --> 35:08.776
And remember to smile, all right?
It's supposed to be a happy day.

35:09.516 --> 35:11.416
Make your way to the hall.

35:11.585 --> 35:14.179
There's a group coming up
behind you, Ehsan.

35:19.093 --> 35:20.754
Don't stare. Check them and move.

35:20.928 --> 35:23.124
- Check them and move.
It's... It's hard.

35:23.297 --> 35:25.163
Several hundred people
visit my hawala.

35:25.332 --> 35:29.701
And not just Afghans.
Somalis, Iragis and Sudanese.

35:29.870 --> 35:32.532
Ladies and
gentlemen, we are about to begin.

35:32.706 --> 35:34.936
Everyone please move
into the main hall.

35:35.109 --> 35:38.477
All right, we're running out of time.
Look carefully.

35:40.614 --> 35:44.278
I see him. Bald, brown jacket,
heading into the main hall.

35:44.451 --> 35:45.816
Okay. I got him.

35:45.986 --> 35:48.146
He's heading into D tunnel.
He's not carrying anything.

35:48.288 --> 35:50.154
He's probably wearing
a suicide vest.

35:50.324 --> 35:52.588
Ehsan, stay in the lobby. Excuse me.

35:56.296 --> 35:57.695
I don't see him yet.

36:00.601 --> 36:02.569
Almost there.

36:03.937 --> 36:05.530
I got him.

36:06.840 --> 36:08.365
Let's get ready to take this guy.

36:12.479 --> 36:14.846
- We have a problem.
- What is it?

36:15.015 --> 36:17.814
This man, every time he came
into the store, he was with a woman.

36:19.086 --> 36:21.680
- You saying there's a second bomber?
- / just saw her.

36:21.855 --> 36:24.483
Green jacket, brown skirt.
She's heading into tunnel C.

36:24.658 --> 36:26.353
- I'monit.
- Ehsan, you're done.

36:26.527 --> 36:28.427
Get out of the building.

36:42.042 --> 36:44.511
Ladies and
gentlemen, Judge Malcolm Smith.

36:44.678 --> 36:45.839
We gotta do this now.

36:48.382 --> 36:50.817
- I got the woman, Deeks.
- Yeah, I'm right behind her.

36:51.618 --> 36:55.111
Hello, everyone.
I am Judge Malcolm Smith.

36:55.289 --> 36:57.018
We will begin in a couple of minutes.

36:58.392 --> 37:00.656
He's got a dead-man's switch, G.

37:00.828 --> 37:03.229
If you haven't turned
in your permanent resident card,

37:03.397 --> 37:04.797
you can do that after the ceremony.

37:04.932 --> 37:08.197
I shoot him, he lets go,
the bomb detonates.

37:11.071 --> 37:12.539
Bad news. She's got one too.

37:14.675 --> 37:16.575
We take one down,
the other one blows.

37:17.111 --> 37:18.943
You guys gotta do it together.

37:19.113 --> 37:20.444
You mean grab the switches?

37:20.614 --> 37:21.638
At exactly the same time.

37:21.815 --> 37:23.579
And keep them closed
until I can get a shot.

37:24.284 --> 37:26.082
Great. This is a fantastic plan.

37:26.253 --> 37:28.779
- I can grab it when you're ready.
- Okay.

37:29.089 --> 37:31.353
Now, I'm going to ask you all
to please remain standing,

37:31.525 --> 37:33.425
and we will get this show
on the road.

37:33.594 --> 37:34.891
It's now or never.

37:35.062 --> 37:36.223
I'm in position.

37:36.396 --> 37:37.727
On three.

37:37.898 --> 37:40.526
I'm taking the woman first, Deeks.
Make sure I have a clean shot.

37:40.701 --> 37:42.795
- Got it.
- One,

37:44.772 --> 37:45.933
two...

37:47.274 --> 37:48.605
She's about to go.

37:57.951 --> 37:59.112
I don't have a shot.

38:00.587 --> 38:02.248
Take it. Don't worry about me.

38:09.930 --> 38:11.762
Sam?

38:18.872 --> 38:19.930
I'm good. Deeks?

38:20.808 --> 38:24.176
Aside from a bullet whizzing six
inches from my head, I'm fantastic.

38:24.912 --> 38:25.936
Sam?

38:26.113 --> 38:29.276
Oh, G, he must have activated a timer
while we were struggling.

38:29.449 --> 38:30.780
I got about 30 seconds.

38:30.951 --> 38:32.350
I'm coming to you.

38:33.821 --> 38:37.758
Okay. I'm good.
She didn't activate hers. Sam?

38:38.158 --> 38:40.490
I need two hands
to defuse the bomb.

38:42.095 --> 38:44.029
I can take it.

38:45.866 --> 38:47.027
Come on. Come on.

38:49.336 --> 38:52.931
Just hold tight.
Hold tight. Hold it tight.

38:55.309 --> 38:56.970
What are you doing here?

38:57.678 --> 38:59.544
I thought you might need some help.

39:04.384 --> 39:06.853
Okay. You can let go.

39:18.065 --> 39:19.624
Still wearing that suit?

39:20.634 --> 39:24.229
Yeah. Last night went very well.

39:25.038 --> 39:27.564
- You guys good?
- Awesome.

39:27.741 --> 39:29.334
Speak for yourself.

39:29.509 --> 39:33.036
If someone could give me a hand,
I'm, uh, still attached to a bomb.

39:33.213 --> 39:35.978
Don't touch anything.
Stay put, all right?

39:40.621 --> 39:42.749
Seven hours after the foiled bombing,

39:42.923 --> 39:45.790
officials finally reopened
the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium.

39:45.959 --> 39:47.893
Police and federal officials
cleared the building

39:48.061 --> 39:50.325
and assured everyone
that it was safe to reenter.

39:50.697 --> 39:52.995
But the real story here
was one of perseverance

39:53.166 --> 39:57.535
for the thousands who came to be
naturalized as American citizens.

40:18.091 --> 40:19.531
Undeterred by the terrifying events,

40:19.693 --> 40:21.855
they moved back inside
and took the Oath of Allegiance.

40:22.029 --> 40:25.226
And I can tell you from personally
meeting some of these new citizens,

40:25.399 --> 40:27.766
they could not be happier
or more proud.

40:27.935 --> 40:30.404
This is a dream come true
for many of these people.

40:30.570 --> 40:31.731
A lot of smiling faces out...

40:31.905 --> 40:33.999
Cannot imagine a happier day.

40:35.075 --> 40:36.406
You can say that again.

40:42.349 --> 40:46.081
Uh, is this about the suit?
I was just about to take it off...

40:46.253 --> 40:49.188
No. No, no.
On second thought, keep it on.

40:51.391 --> 40:53.359
What's happening? Am I in trouble?

40:53.527 --> 40:55.052
No.

40:58.432 --> 40:59.593
Mr. Navid,

40:59.766 --> 41:02.736
you're about to become a citizen
of the United States of America.

41:03.870 --> 41:06.134
Really? Now?

41:07.140 --> 41:08.539
You passed your test.

41:08.709 --> 41:10.199
And thwarted a major attack.

41:10.377 --> 41:12.539
Besides, you're dressed
for the occasion.

41:12.713 --> 41:14.943
And I've been in touch
with the State Department

41:15.115 --> 41:18.813
about starting the visa process
for your mother and sisters.

41:20.354 --> 41:23.551
Please, put up your right hand
and repeat after me.

41:29.296 --> 41:30.457
I don't need to repeat.

41:30.864 --> 41:32.992
I know it by heart.

41:33.467 --> 41:36.232
I hereby declare, on oath,

41:36.403 --> 41:38.770
that I absolutely and entirely

41:39.406 --> 41:42.103
renounce and abjure all allegiance

41:42.275 --> 41:47.805
and fidelity to all foreign prince,
potentate, state or sovereignty

41:47.981 --> 41:52.782
of whom or which I have heretofore
been subject or citizen.

41:52.953 --> 41:55.320
That I will support

41:55.789 --> 41:57.780
and defend

41:58.196 --> 42:01.954
the constitution and laws
of the United States of America

42:02.129 --> 42:06.828
against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.
