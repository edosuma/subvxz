WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:03.671
Lady Luck
is on your side
from LA to Vegas.

00:03.704 --> 00:06.907
What, are you gonna put
a sock on the cockpit door?
Don't cockpit-block me.

00:06.940 --> 00:08.342
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.376 --> 00:09.977
And check out
our other Fox programs,

00:10.010 --> 00:12.046
The Mick, The Last Man on Earth,

00:12.080 --> 00:13.247
and Brooklyn Nine-Nine.

00:13.281 --> 00:14.582
The kids are gonna love it.

00:14.615 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:19.253 --> 00:21.255
Hey, Ronnie!

00:21.289 --> 00:24.325
Why was I forced
to check my carry-on?

00:24.358 --> 00:27.061
I made sure it fit
this little bag prison.

00:27.095 --> 00:30.564
Normally I would blame Jackpot,
but this one's on me.

00:30.598 --> 00:32.333
I needed the bin space.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.335
I'm moving all my stuff
to Bryan's apartment,

00:34.368 --> 00:37.105
and this is the cheapest way
to get it from L.A. to Vegas.

00:37.138 --> 00:38.506
No, the cheapest way
would have been

00:38.539 --> 00:40.074
a pack of matches
to light it on fire.

00:40.108 --> 00:41.675
Oh. Bernard's just lashing out

00:41.709 --> 00:43.111
because he's gonna miss me.

00:43.144 --> 00:45.346
Yes. Who else would be there
every morning

00:45.379 --> 00:47.848
to wake me with the rhythmic hum
of a mustache trimmer?

00:47.881 --> 00:49.583
Oh. I'm gonna go

00:49.617 --> 00:51.919
before he misses me
into a shrink I can't afford.

00:51.952 --> 00:54.455
(women whooping)

00:54.488 --> 00:56.257
Ronnie!

00:56.290 --> 00:58.092
Oh, my God! Jill!

00:58.126 --> 01:02.029
I haven't see you since you got
that JFK route on Delta.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.864
I know. I've been wanting
to call you guys,

01:03.897 --> 01:05.366
but I've been so busy.

01:05.399 --> 01:06.900
And I'm about
to be even busier because

01:06.934 --> 01:09.069
I just got promoted
to the New York to Paris!

01:09.103 --> 01:10.471
Dreams come true!

01:10.504 --> 01:12.240
-WOMEN: Dreams come true!
-(Jill whoops)

01:12.273 --> 01:15.042
Wow. You got promoted already.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.710
And it's all because of you,
Ronnie.

01:16.744 --> 01:19.147
I didn't even know
about that L.A. to JFK job

01:19.180 --> 01:21.215
until I heard you talking
about how much you wanted it.

01:21.249 --> 01:25.119
I am so happy
my dream worked out for you.

01:25.153 --> 01:27.488
How are you?
How's the L.A. to Vegas?

01:27.521 --> 01:29.490
Amazing, too.

01:29.523 --> 01:31.459
Every day is such a...

01:31.492 --> 01:32.726
MAN:
Heads up.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.762
...blessing.

01:34.795 --> 01:36.664
Dreams come true.

01:36.697 --> 01:38.232
WOMEN:
Dreams come true!

01:38.266 --> 01:39.567
MAN:
I can't feel my feet!

01:39.600 --> 01:40.668
PILOT (over P.A.):
Jackpot Airlines.

01:40.701 --> 01:42.636
Northeast-bound to Las Vegas.

01:42.670 --> 01:45.639
*

01:45.673 --> 01:47.308
(slot machine chiming)

01:47.341 --> 01:49.543
(electronic chime)

01:51.512 --> 01:53.514
So you're really gonna propose
to Patricia this weekend?

01:53.547 --> 01:55.949
That's right. What a relief.

01:55.983 --> 01:57.651
I was starting
to worry I was doomed

01:57.685 --> 01:59.953
to wander this earth alone
like some lonely fish god,

01:59.987 --> 02:01.522
forever searching
for the right woman

02:01.555 --> 02:03.324
to drag underwater
and feed me eggs.

02:03.357 --> 02:05.659
Oh, I love The Shape of Water.

02:05.693 --> 02:08.529
What the hell is that?
No, I'm just saying, after three

02:08.562 --> 02:10.764
failed marriages,
this one is different.

02:10.798 --> 02:13.467
Patty is strong, decisive,
insightful.

02:13.501 --> 02:17.538
Yup, Captain Dave
has finally found a co-pilot.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.841
I have to go to the bathroom.

02:20.874 --> 02:24.978
You just went.

02:25.012 --> 02:26.847
-(women whooping)
-I'm just so annoyed.

02:26.880 --> 02:29.517
Jill's getting a promotion for a
job that should have been mine.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.151
How come she gets
to go to Paris?

02:31.185 --> 02:33.654
Paris is overrated. Hong Kong is
where you want to go.

02:33.687 --> 02:35.489
I've been there for several
Taken- like auctions,

02:35.523 --> 02:37.558
both as a sale item
and a bidder.

02:37.591 --> 02:38.826
I've never been anywhere.

02:38.859 --> 02:40.160
I've never even been
east of Des Moines.

02:40.194 --> 02:41.195
You don't want to ask me

02:41.229 --> 02:42.496
one follow-up question
about that?

02:42.530 --> 02:43.897
I just can't believe

02:43.931 --> 02:45.699
stupid Jill
is stealing my dream.

02:45.733 --> 02:47.034
Forget about Jill.

02:47.067 --> 02:49.403
She has to focus on work
because she has nothing else.

02:49.437 --> 02:50.838
And you're doing great.

02:50.871 --> 02:53.407
You're moving to a great place
with a great guy.

02:53.441 --> 02:55.409
You're right. Bryan's the best.

02:55.443 --> 02:57.745
You know he actually stops
for ambulances,

02:57.778 --> 03:00.047
instead of following them
to cut through traffic?

03:00.080 --> 03:02.216
(lively chatter)

03:07.455 --> 03:08.756
Why are you looking at me
like that?

03:08.789 --> 03:10.524
Why don't you just kiss her
already?

03:10.558 --> 03:11.892
I know you want to.

03:11.925 --> 03:14.328
Because she has a boyfriend
she's moving in with.

03:14.362 --> 03:16.997
Exactly. It's now or never.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.099
Well, then it's never,
because right now,

03:19.132 --> 03:21.735
I am not in the head space
to even consider it.

03:21.769 --> 03:24.738
I mean, this unending divorce,
Artem, is killing me.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.740
I sent Meghan
the divorce papers,

03:26.774 --> 03:29.910
she sends them back, unsigned,
with a list of more demands.

03:29.943 --> 03:31.745
Colin, you need to end this.

03:31.779 --> 03:35.783
You have to be strong, put your
foot down and say "No more."

03:35.816 --> 03:39.019
That's also an excellent way
to get rid of poltergeists.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.522
Oh, it's a shame. This was
almost a normal interaction.

03:41.555 --> 03:43.090
Maybe next time.

03:43.123 --> 03:46.294
Uh, Dave,
I got a text from my mom before,

03:46.327 --> 03:48.696
asking me to meet her in Vegas
at a Michael Bublé-themed

03:48.729 --> 03:50.864
Cirque du Soleil.
Do you know anything about that?

03:50.898 --> 03:52.700
Yeah, Cirque du Bublé.
They sell you the whole seat,

03:52.733 --> 03:54.768
-but all you need is the edge.
-No, she said she won

03:54.802 --> 03:56.304
the tickets
at a Jackpot Airlines raffle.

03:56.337 --> 03:58.105
What the hell is going on?

03:58.138 --> 04:01.108
Oh, I needed an excuse to get
her on the Vegas to L.A. flight

04:01.141 --> 04:02.876
on Sunday because that's where
I'm going to propose.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.578
I already bought her
a gorgeous ring.

04:04.612 --> 04:05.979
You wouldn't believe
how many karats it has.

04:06.013 --> 04:07.315
(mouths)

04:07.348 --> 04:10.250
That is crazy. You broke up
with her two weeks ago.

04:10.284 --> 04:12.553
You can't propose to someone
you're not even dating.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.221
I know this is all
happening fast,

04:14.254 --> 04:16.457
but love has only one speed:
fast.

04:16.490 --> 04:18.659
Don't worry.
You could be maid of honor.

04:18.692 --> 04:20.828
You'll be walking down the aisle
with my best man--

04:20.861 --> 04:23.364
a rescue dog named Maverick,
who's never been on a leash.

04:27.935 --> 04:30.237
BRYAN (on phone):
So, I'll come by the airport

04:30.270 --> 04:32.172
around 6:00
to pick up your stuff.

04:32.205 --> 04:34.742
And then I'll officially
be moved into our place.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.143
I'm bringing a bottle
of champagne

04:36.176 --> 04:37.945
to break on the door
to christen it.

04:37.978 --> 04:39.513
-I think that's only for boats.
-Oh.

04:39.547 --> 04:41.148
Well, in that case, we'll just
get drunk on champagne

04:41.181 --> 04:42.516
and go to bed with headaches.

04:42.550 --> 04:44.352
I'll see you at 6:00.

04:44.385 --> 04:45.653
Ronnie, I need your help.

04:45.686 --> 04:47.287
We cannot let Dave marry my mom.

04:47.321 --> 04:48.489
I mean, I'm already a stripper.

04:48.522 --> 04:49.857
Who knows
how this issue will manifest?

04:49.890 --> 04:51.325
Yeah, I can't believe
he's actually doing this.

04:51.359 --> 04:52.926
I will help you talk some sense
into him.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.463
Let's go to the Paris because
I'm going to Paris!

04:55.496 --> 04:57.465
(cheering, whooping)

04:57.498 --> 04:59.833
Actually, I'm sorry.
I have to go do something,

04:59.867 --> 05:01.101
but good luck with Dave.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.003
Where is she going?

05:03.036 --> 05:05.138
She only walks that speed
towards costly mistakes

05:05.172 --> 05:06.840
and free meatballs.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.845
-What are you doing here?
-Ronnie took all the crew bins,

05:11.879 --> 05:14.448
so I had to check my bag
like some dirty ground-o.

05:14.482 --> 05:16.817
Thank you for flying Jackpot.

05:16.850 --> 05:19.820
Wait till you see this ring
I got Patricia.

05:19.853 --> 05:22.556
Cost a fortune. Most expensive
thing I ever bought.

05:22.590 --> 05:24.558
That's how you know
it's a smart move.

05:24.592 --> 05:28.295
My most expensive purchase
was buying back my daughter

05:28.328 --> 05:30.297
from a local crime lord.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.700
No, it was pizza oven.

05:32.733 --> 05:35.235
All right,
that's the last of them.

05:35.268 --> 05:37.004
Wait, wait, wait.
That's it? Where's my bag?

05:37.037 --> 05:39.206
I don't know, bro.
That was the end of it.

05:39.239 --> 05:40.874
Oh, sweet. I'm on break.

05:40.908 --> 05:42.710
No, no, no, no, no!

05:42.743 --> 05:44.011
ARTEM:
What's wrong?

05:44.044 --> 05:45.345
My engagement ring was
in that bag.

05:45.379 --> 05:46.814
That seems unwise.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.716
Airlines lose luggage
literally all the time.

05:48.749 --> 05:51.685
-They do?
-Yes! Why do you think people
hate air travel?

05:51.719 --> 05:53.186
People hate air travel?

05:53.220 --> 05:55.355
Oh, God.
What am I gonna do?

05:55.389 --> 05:56.890
Don't worry. It's okay.

05:56.924 --> 05:59.226
Jackpot Airlines has lost
my luggage plenty of times.

05:59.259 --> 06:01.429
-And they always found it?
-Nope. Not once. I'm sorry.

06:01.462 --> 06:03.597
I don't know why I thought
that would be reassuring.

06:09.437 --> 06:11.439
How was your meeting?

06:11.472 --> 06:13.674
Oh, uh, what meeting?

06:13.707 --> 06:14.908
Don't bother lying.

06:14.942 --> 06:16.510
I saw you sneaking around
the Delta offices.

06:16.544 --> 06:18.412
I followed you.
What were you doing?

06:18.446 --> 06:21.248
All right,
I went to see Delta HR.

06:21.281 --> 06:23.350
Since Jill got that promotion,
I was just curious

06:23.383 --> 06:25.453
to see if they needed someone
for the JFK route.

06:25.486 --> 06:26.854
I knew it.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.221
You're still pining
for New York,

06:28.255 --> 06:29.623
like some high school
theater beard.

06:29.657 --> 06:31.425
I just needed
to see if it was possible.

06:31.459 --> 06:33.393
But don't worry. It's not.

06:33.427 --> 06:35.362
They remembered me
from last time,

06:35.395 --> 06:37.698
and they're not interested.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.399
Fine.

06:39.433 --> 06:41.034
If this job is still something

06:41.068 --> 06:43.937
you care so much about,
I will help you get it.

06:43.971 --> 06:45.873
You can't.
The HR guy won't even see me.

06:45.906 --> 06:48.141
The universe does not want me
to ever get this job.

06:48.175 --> 06:50.410
Then that's even more reason
for us to get it.

06:50.444 --> 06:52.580
You hear me,
you dried up old bitch?

06:52.613 --> 06:54.615
Bernard is coming for you.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.485
This is a disaster.

06:57.518 --> 07:00.087
I have a stunning proposal on
Sunday and no engagement ring,

07:00.120 --> 07:01.889
or money to buy another one.

07:01.922 --> 07:05.959
Hey, I have a good idea.

07:05.993 --> 07:08.061
Captain Dave needs a ring,
and you, Colin,

07:08.095 --> 07:11.298
you have a ring from the flaming
wreckage of your marriage.

07:11.331 --> 07:13.634
-Just give him yours.
-DAVE: Perfect.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.102
I'll buy it from you.
Name your price,

07:15.135 --> 07:16.637
and I'll write you an IOU
right here.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.138
I don't care what it looks like.

07:18.171 --> 07:19.473
At this point,
I'll settle for anything.

07:19.507 --> 07:20.808
Oh, well, it is not anything.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.175
It is a beautiful
family heirloom

07:22.209 --> 07:23.777
passed down
from Nana Bear McCormack,

07:23.811 --> 07:25.746
and I already told you,
my ex-wife took everything.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.414
She still has the ring.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.449
If I ask her for something now,
the divorce will just

07:29.483 --> 07:31.785
-drag on forever.
-Yeah, it will drag on forever

07:31.819 --> 07:33.921
if you don't stand up to her!

07:33.954 --> 07:37.525
And besides, our sad,
pathetic Captain Dave--

07:37.558 --> 07:39.259
he needs you, Colin.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.961
Come on, Colin.

07:40.994 --> 07:43.196
I've been there for you
through your divorce

07:43.230 --> 07:45.132
because I consider you a friend.

07:45.165 --> 07:48.636
And as a friend, right now
I need you there for me.

07:50.738 --> 07:52.205
There he is.

07:52.239 --> 07:53.841
There's the HR guy.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.108
This is pointless, Bernard.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.810
He already said
he's not gonna meet with me.

07:56.844 --> 07:58.445
Never give up.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.681
-Hey, Alan, can you help us
with something?
-Sure.

08:00.714 --> 08:02.883
As long as I don't have
to lift anything, 'cause my back

08:02.916 --> 08:03.951
has this...

08:03.984 --> 08:05.385
No!

08:05.418 --> 08:07.054
(people gasping)

08:07.087 --> 08:09.189
You killed our friend!

08:09.222 --> 08:11.491
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
I'll call a medic.

08:11.525 --> 08:13.661
They're on their way.
And while we're waiting,

08:13.694 --> 08:16.496
you have time to give
my friend Ronnie a fair shot.

08:18.766 --> 08:21.535
Look, I know that maybe I
didn't make the best impression

08:21.569 --> 08:23.871
last time I applied
for this position.

08:23.904 --> 08:26.874
But when I'm in the air,
I work my ass off.

08:26.907 --> 08:30.243
I have tendonitis in my shoulder
from closing overhead bins.

08:30.277 --> 08:32.512
Carpal tunnel
from opening soda cans.

08:32.546 --> 08:35.048
My voice used to be
three octaves higher,

08:35.082 --> 08:38.018
and my hair used to be
three layers thicker.

08:38.051 --> 08:41.388
But I still love this job more
than anything I've ever done.

08:41.421 --> 08:42.890
And I have coworkers

08:42.923 --> 08:45.492
who are willing to throw someone
in front of a cart

08:45.525 --> 08:47.728
and get hit by a cart for me.

08:47.761 --> 08:49.096
So come on, Mark.

08:49.129 --> 08:50.731
I deserve that job.

08:50.764 --> 08:53.533
All I'm asking is
for a chance to prove it.

08:55.035 --> 08:57.237
Can you just look again?
It's black.

08:57.270 --> 08:59.239
Cool handle
that can go up and down.

08:59.272 --> 09:01.041
Tag not filled out,
because why would I?

09:01.074 --> 09:02.610
Dave, Artem told me you
were here. We have to talk.

09:02.643 --> 09:04.878
Did you know that airlines
can lose your bags?

09:04.912 --> 09:06.914
How is it possible?
It's a foolproof system.

09:06.947 --> 09:09.549
You give your bag to a stranger,
it goes on a belt into darkness,

09:09.583 --> 09:11.251
and shows up
a thousand miles away.

09:11.284 --> 09:13.020
-How do you mess that up?
-Okay.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.454
Listen to me.

09:14.487 --> 09:16.590
You cannot propose to my mother.

09:16.624 --> 09:18.291
That would be a huge mistake.

09:18.325 --> 09:20.093
And deep down, you know that.

09:20.127 --> 09:22.195
Why else would you have
broken it off and walked away?

09:22.229 --> 09:23.931
I walked away thinking
she'd chase after me,

09:23.964 --> 09:25.599
yelling, "Dave, don't go."

09:25.633 --> 09:27.534
-And then it
would start raining.
-No.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.436
You did it because your
relationship is dysfunctional,

09:29.469 --> 09:32.372
and now you're trying to find
an easy answer to fix it.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.741
Every relationship is
a little dysfunctional.

09:33.774 --> 09:35.809
You lie to your mom
about being a stripper.

09:35.843 --> 09:37.277
(scoffs)
Okay, that's... Don't...

09:37.310 --> 09:38.746
No, this isn't about me.

09:38.779 --> 09:41.214
Just admit, the only reason
you're proposing to my mom

09:41.248 --> 09:43.083
is because you're scared
to be alone.

09:43.116 --> 09:46.286
I know you don't understand,
but I believe your mom and I

09:46.319 --> 09:48.789
have a chance at something
that could last.

09:48.822 --> 09:50.557
I at least have to try,

09:50.590 --> 09:52.726
or else I'll never know.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.327
Any luck with that bag?

09:56.429 --> 09:58.699
I really hate you.

10:00.701 --> 10:03.303
Okay, the strategy
is Good Cop-Artem.

10:03.336 --> 10:05.405
I ask her nicely for the ring.

10:05.438 --> 10:06.774
When she says no,

10:06.807 --> 10:08.842
you say something weird
to throw her off.

10:08.876 --> 10:12.345
At home my wife and I play
Good Cop-Artem in bed.

10:12.379 --> 10:15.248
But I am good cop
and she is Artem.

10:15.282 --> 10:18.551
-Yeah, something like that
would be fine.
-Yeah.

10:19.887 --> 10:21.288
Oh! Oh, my God.

10:21.321 --> 10:23.991
I made you appear.
(laughs)

10:24.024 --> 10:27.828
Colin, what are you doing here?

10:27.861 --> 10:29.596
I'm here to discuss
something very important.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.666
Um, I would like my family
engagement ring back.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.601
(chuckles):
What are you talking about?

10:34.634 --> 10:36.469
The ring is in your pocket.

10:38.405 --> 10:40.140
This is a crumpled-up
eight of spades.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.641
Ta-da!

10:41.675 --> 10:43.310
That was impressive,
although annoying.

10:43.343 --> 10:46.279
Uh, listen, Meghan,
I have been so accommodating

10:46.313 --> 10:48.615
with every one
of your unreasonable demands.

10:48.648 --> 10:51.551
I-I'm just asking for such
a small thing in return.

10:51.584 --> 10:54.287
Sorry, baby, my lawyer told me
the ring was a gift,

10:54.321 --> 10:56.289
so I don't have to give it back.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.558
I told you this was
a waste of time.

10:58.591 --> 11:00.193
Let's just go home.

11:00.227 --> 11:03.296
No, if you walk out now,
nothing will be changed.

11:03.330 --> 11:04.631
Colin...

11:04.664 --> 11:06.266
no more good cop.

11:10.370 --> 11:11.839
You know what?

11:11.872 --> 11:13.306
Keep the ring.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.175
Consider it a parting gift.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.911
'Cause from now on,
things are gonna change.

11:17.945 --> 11:20.013
These are the divorce papers.

11:20.047 --> 11:22.249
You're gonna sign them,
you're gonna return them,

11:22.282 --> 11:24.684
and if not, you'll
be hearing from my lawyer.

11:24.718 --> 11:26.653
-And that's me.
-No, I have an actual,

11:26.686 --> 11:28.221
real, legitimate lawyer.

11:29.256 --> 11:31.759
-Hey.
-Hey. I was just game-planning

11:31.792 --> 11:34.261
on how to fit
all this stuff in my car,

11:34.294 --> 11:36.997
and I was thinking,
if I fold down the back seat,

11:37.030 --> 11:38.231
none of it will fit.

11:38.265 --> 11:39.599
Forget about that for a second.

11:39.632 --> 11:41.601
Come sit down.
I have very exciting news.

11:41.634 --> 11:43.570
-Okay.
-(sighs)

11:43.603 --> 11:45.605
I got a job for Delta.

11:45.638 --> 11:47.741
Wow! That's incredible.
I mean, that's an airline

11:47.775 --> 11:49.542
that I'd actually
feel safe flying.

11:49.576 --> 11:51.544
I'm gonna be on the L.A. to JFK.

11:51.578 --> 11:53.947
It's the job
I've wanted forever.

11:53.981 --> 11:55.282
Okay, that's... good.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.017
But I'm just a little confused.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.852
You're gonna be flying
from Los Angeles to New York

11:58.886 --> 12:01.221
-but living in Las Vegas?
-Yeah, but it's okay.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.256
I mean, a lot
of flight attendants live

12:03.290 --> 12:05.525
in a city that's different
from their base.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.360
I mean, Mernine lives here,

12:07.394 --> 12:09.429
but she's based
out of St. Louis.

12:09.462 --> 12:10.798
And that works.
Right, Mernine?

12:10.831 --> 12:13.767
Howard Hughes wants
to put me in a picture.

12:13.801 --> 12:16.770
I really have to stop using her
as my model for things.

12:16.804 --> 12:18.939
But we can figure it out.

12:18.972 --> 12:20.808
Look, I just thought
we were moving forward.

12:20.841 --> 12:23.443
I'm not sure how I feel about
you being gone all the time.

12:23.476 --> 12:26.213
Well, it's not...

12:26.246 --> 12:27.680
(laughs):
I-I mean, this is...

12:28.748 --> 12:30.417
We can make it work.

12:30.450 --> 12:31.785
I know we can.

12:31.819 --> 12:33.921
Yeah. Sure.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.088
Hmm.

12:35.122 --> 12:36.890
Uh...

12:36.924 --> 12:39.793
I'm gonna get a cart
to carry all this stuff.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.771
There's something
very wrong

12:51.805 --> 12:53.740
when I'm the one
doing all the work.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.775
I'm sorry.
I am just trying to figure out

12:55.809 --> 12:57.444
all this Bryan and job stuff.

12:57.477 --> 12:59.246
I figure eight flights,

12:59.279 --> 13:01.949
three layovers a week--
that leaves me...

13:01.982 --> 13:03.683
20 hours a week in Vegas.

13:03.716 --> 13:05.618
Some of them
might even be awake.

13:05.652 --> 13:07.988
Damn it, I was just
so excited about this route,

13:08.021 --> 13:10.690
I didn't think how it
would affect me living in Vegas.

13:10.723 --> 13:12.625
Well, this Delta job
is your dream.

13:12.659 --> 13:14.928
So staying in L.A.
makes the most sense.

13:14.962 --> 13:17.264
Yeah, I guess.

13:17.297 --> 13:20.033
Hey, how come you suddenly
decided to help me get this job?

13:20.067 --> 13:21.768
You hate New York--
you said it's

13:21.801 --> 13:24.004
your least favorite character
on Sex and the City.

13:24.037 --> 13:26.739
I just wanted to help you
achieve your dream.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.544
Bernard.

13:31.578 --> 13:33.180
And I don't want you
to move out, okay?

13:33.213 --> 13:34.647
And I knew if you got that job,

13:34.681 --> 13:36.283
you'd have to stay
in L.A. with me.

13:36.316 --> 13:37.851
I can't believe this.

13:37.885 --> 13:40.620
I-I thought you were helping me
because we were friends,

13:40.653 --> 13:43.023
but you somehow made
an unselfish act selfish.

13:43.056 --> 13:44.357
I don't want
to lose you, Ronnie.

13:44.391 --> 13:45.725
I'm telling you
I want you to stay.

13:45.758 --> 13:47.394
Do you know how devastated
John Stamos was

13:47.427 --> 13:49.396
-that I could never say
those words to him?
-Oh, my God.

13:49.429 --> 13:51.064
This is not about you.
Stop bragging.

13:51.098 --> 13:53.466
I'm not! If I were bragging,

13:53.500 --> 13:55.602
I'd tell you my Clooney story.

13:57.004 --> 13:59.539
-Hey, fellas.
-ARTEM: Captain Dave.

13:59.572 --> 14:01.241
Sorry again
I couldn't get the ring back.

14:01.274 --> 14:05.178
He got something even better--
testicular manhood.

14:05.212 --> 14:07.981
-How does that help me?
I can't propose with that.
-No,

14:08.015 --> 14:10.984
but I have something
you can propose with.

14:11.018 --> 14:13.020
My bag.

14:13.053 --> 14:14.487
Oh, thank God.

14:14.521 --> 14:15.889
Where did you find it?

14:15.923 --> 14:17.657
Jackpot didn't lose it.
I took it.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.492
-You had it?
-I know it was rash.

14:19.526 --> 14:22.595
I was just trying to stall
so you couldn't propose today.

14:22.629 --> 14:24.831
But you were right--
you and my mom deserve a chance

14:24.864 --> 14:26.033
to figure it out for yourselves.

14:26.066 --> 14:28.268
Thanks, Nichole.
Though I wish I'd known sooner.

14:28.301 --> 14:30.237
I got so many people fired
for this.

14:30.270 --> 14:32.405
Oh, well.
The proposal's back on, boys.

14:36.809 --> 14:40.180
That Cirque du Bublé show
was incredible,

14:40.213 --> 14:41.848
-wasn't it?
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.451
Next year we should go back
for Cirque du Sade.

14:44.484 --> 14:45.919
-Mmm.
-My treat.

14:45.953 --> 14:48.421
I know how tight money can be
on a student budget.

14:48.455 --> 14:51.124
Yep. Very tight.
Absolutely no traceable income.

14:51.158 --> 14:53.093
(sighs)

14:53.126 --> 14:54.627
Everything okay?

14:54.661 --> 14:56.930
Oh, it should be.

14:56.964 --> 14:59.632
I got the job
I thought I always wanted.

14:59.666 --> 15:02.102
The guy
I thought I always wanted.

15:02.135 --> 15:04.104
But now I have to choose.

15:04.137 --> 15:06.306
Or I could just say screw it all
and go to Hong Kong.

15:06.339 --> 15:07.975
I'd settle for anywhere

15:08.008 --> 15:10.077
no one speaks English so there's
no one I can disappoint.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.311
Well, if you're looking
for somewhere

15:11.344 --> 15:12.879
they don't speak English,
you should join me

15:12.912 --> 15:14.547
in my family home in Manchester.

15:14.581 --> 15:15.949
They communicate only using

15:15.983 --> 15:17.917
-long, judgmental sighs.
-(laughs)

15:17.951 --> 15:21.088
Sounds like you're my best
option right now, McCormack.

15:30.297 --> 15:31.898
You just kissed me.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.133
Yes, I did.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.801
I-I know
this is terrible timing,

15:34.834 --> 15:36.136
but I can't keep lying down

15:36.169 --> 15:37.470
and waiting
for things to happen,

15:37.504 --> 15:39.439
and I wish these words
were as good as that kiss.

15:39.472 --> 15:41.008
That kiss was good, right?

15:41.041 --> 15:43.676
Y-You just kissed me.

15:43.710 --> 15:44.911
(electronic chime)

15:44.944 --> 15:47.147
Dave's starting.

15:47.180 --> 15:48.781
I have to go.

15:48.815 --> 15:50.317
DAVE (over P.A.):
Attention, passengers.

15:50.350 --> 15:52.585
There seems to be a problem
with the lighting.

15:52.619 --> 15:53.753
If you could please reach
into your seat back pocket,

15:53.786 --> 15:56.256
pull out your signal lights,

15:56.289 --> 15:59.826
and guide the path to love.

15:59.859 --> 16:01.294
("The Lady in Red"
by Chris de Burgh playing)

16:14.341 --> 16:16.176
* Never seen you looking
so lovely *

16:16.209 --> 16:18.845
* As you did tonight *

16:18.878 --> 16:21.514
* I've never seen you shine
so bright *

16:26.353 --> 16:27.954
* And I have never seen
that dress *

16:27.987 --> 16:29.956
* You're wearing *

16:29.989 --> 16:33.160
* Or the highlights in your hair
that catch your eyes *

16:34.694 --> 16:35.695
Patricia...

16:35.728 --> 16:38.631
* I have been blind *

16:38.665 --> 16:41.034
* The lady in red *

16:43.870 --> 16:45.305
* My lady in red... *

16:45.338 --> 16:47.140
The seat belt sign
has been turned off.

16:47.174 --> 16:48.608
You may now move freely
about the cabin.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.990
So, is this part
of the proposal?

17:04.023 --> 17:06.526
No. I got out there,

17:06.559 --> 17:08.228
and my adrenaline was pumping,

17:08.261 --> 17:11.098
and I realized...
I don't have to do this.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.532
You were right, Nichole.

17:12.565 --> 17:13.900
I thought marriage
was the answer

17:13.933 --> 17:15.668
so I wouldn't
keep feeling alone.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.937
Then I looked around
and saw the faces of my friends,

17:17.970 --> 17:21.274
and I realized I'm not alone.

17:21.308 --> 17:22.675
Of course you're not.

17:22.709 --> 17:23.910
And you're making
the right decision.

17:23.943 --> 17:26.346
Just...
with the worst possible timing.

17:26.379 --> 17:28.081
Yeah. That was
a little humiliating.

17:28.115 --> 17:30.183
I got to be honest.
I'll let this plane crash

17:30.217 --> 17:31.718
before I walk
past your mom again.

17:31.751 --> 17:33.353
Come on.
I'll go out there with you.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.088
And how do I explain all this?

17:35.122 --> 17:37.224
Maybe it's time
to just start being honest.

17:37.257 --> 17:39.759
Nah, I'll think of something.

17:39.792 --> 17:40.793
(scoffs)

17:40.827 --> 17:42.462
Dave, this clearly isn't

17:42.495 --> 17:44.231
just some normal flight.

17:44.264 --> 17:47.634
I think someone needs to explain
to me what is going on here.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.736
Okay, Patricia.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.938
Um, no, Mom.

17:51.971 --> 17:53.173
Here's what's going on.

17:54.341 --> 17:55.908
I'm a stripper.

17:55.942 --> 17:58.145
I take my clothes off for money,

17:58.178 --> 18:00.780
and I've been lying to you
about it for a really long time.

18:00.813 --> 18:04.217
We have to be honest. Our
relationship is dysfunctional,

18:04.251 --> 18:06.819
and there aren't
any easy answers to fix that.

18:06.853 --> 18:09.789
(chuckles):
No. That's...

18:10.757 --> 18:12.091
I need that.

18:12.125 --> 18:14.727
Cards on the table,

18:14.761 --> 18:16.763
I was going to propose.

18:16.796 --> 18:18.465
I'm glad I didn't.

18:18.498 --> 18:21.468
It's a real
emotional growth moment for me.

18:24.471 --> 18:26.473
(sighs)

18:30.177 --> 18:31.911
Weird day, huh?

18:31.944 --> 18:34.914
Who the hell knows anymore?

18:34.947 --> 18:36.916
So, what are you gonna do
with that?

18:36.949 --> 18:38.451
(sighs)

18:38.485 --> 18:39.686
No point in keeping it.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.821
Got to find a pawn shop
to sell it off.

18:41.854 --> 18:43.323
Unless you're interested.

18:43.356 --> 18:45.658
In buying it.
Not marrying me.

18:45.692 --> 18:48.328
Like you could handle all this.

18:48.361 --> 18:50.129
No, I'm good on both.

18:50.163 --> 18:51.698
Heard you got that JFK route.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.766
It's a good job.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.636
It would also probably
be the end of me and Bryan.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.438
He's a good guy.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.207
Never actually talked to him,
but I respect

19:00.240 --> 19:01.708
the courage it takes
to have that ponytail.

19:01.741 --> 19:02.709
He cut the ponytail.

19:02.742 --> 19:03.976
Coward.

19:04.010 --> 19:05.678
So, if I stay with Bryan,

19:05.712 --> 19:07.980
I miss out on an opportunity
that could change my life.

19:08.014 --> 19:09.616
But if I take the job,

19:09.649 --> 19:12.785
I end the best relationship
I've ever been in.

19:12.819 --> 19:15.522
Which maybe I should do anyway
if I have feelings for Colin.

19:15.555 --> 19:16.789
I just don't know.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.291
Sounds to me
like you could either do

19:18.325 --> 19:19.626
what's right for your career,

19:19.659 --> 19:21.628
or you could do what's right
for your relationships.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.463
So what do I do?

19:23.496 --> 19:25.765
You do what's right for you.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.504
But just for my sake,
hypothetically,

19:31.538 --> 19:33.139
if I had been asking you
to marry me...

19:33.172 --> 19:35.908
(scoffs)
Like you could handle all this.

19:41.914 --> 19:45.718
Nichole, how did your mom
take the news?

19:45.752 --> 19:47.053
Well, she's still processing it.

19:47.086 --> 19:48.488
And she kicked me out
of the house.

19:48.521 --> 19:49.922
But I learned a valuable lesson:

19:49.956 --> 19:52.024
-never be honest again.
-Hmm.

19:52.058 --> 19:53.360
Oh, Bernard, Bernard.

19:53.393 --> 19:55.662
Uh, is Ronnie here yet?

19:55.695 --> 19:57.397
Do you have any idea
what she decided to do?

19:57.430 --> 19:58.565
No, I haven't seen her

19:58.598 --> 20:00.400
ever since my true motives
were exposed.

20:00.433 --> 20:01.734
It's taught me
a valuable lesson:

20:01.768 --> 20:03.102
never be honest again.

20:03.135 --> 20:04.771
Captain Dave.

20:04.804 --> 20:06.105
How you doing?

20:06.138 --> 20:07.774
We know it was hard,
but we're all really proud

20:07.807 --> 20:09.342
of what you did the other day.

20:09.376 --> 20:11.177
You made the right decision
in not proposing.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.845
You're damn right I did.

20:12.879 --> 20:15.047
Because right after that,
I met someone even better.

20:15.081 --> 20:16.383
-What?
-You heard me.

20:16.416 --> 20:19.286
Captain Dave is in love again.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.621
I went to a Vegas pawn shop
to sell off the ring,

20:21.654 --> 20:24.056
and there she was,
like an angel from heaven,

20:24.090 --> 20:25.458
selling her old ring.
Can you believe it?

20:25.492 --> 20:26.793
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You...

20:26.826 --> 20:28.295
-you met a woman?
-That's right.

20:28.328 --> 20:29.762
She came back to L.A.,

20:29.796 --> 20:33.733
and we had two
heart-pounding nights together.

20:33.766 --> 20:34.967
Hey, babycakes.

20:35.001 --> 20:36.736
Come out here
and meet my amigos.

20:36.769 --> 20:38.971
Oh! (laughs) Hi.

20:39.005 --> 20:40.206
Everyone, this is Meghan.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.374
MEGHAN:
Oh.

20:41.408 --> 20:43.910
-Hi. Colin.
-Meghan.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.445
How do you two know each other?

20:50.483 --> 20:52.452
DAVE:
Hey, there, passengers.

20:52.485 --> 20:55.422
As we start our descent
into Sin City,

20:55.455 --> 20:57.490
here's a little
captain's wisdom for you.

20:57.524 --> 20:59.659
If you think you know what's
gonna happen this weekend,

20:59.692 --> 21:02.395
guess what?
You don't.

21:02.429 --> 21:05.231
So if I were you,
I'd ditch those best-laid plans

21:05.264 --> 21:07.600
and follow your heart.

21:07.634 --> 21:09.068
Gamble on yourself.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.470
Or on the Pacers minus six.

21:10.503 --> 21:11.638
Take a risk.

21:11.671 --> 21:13.306
Maybe it works out.

21:13.340 --> 21:15.107
Maybe it doesn't.

21:15.141 --> 21:18.345
But that's why
you have your friends.

21:18.378 --> 21:21.147
Because this town
can chew you up,

21:21.180 --> 21:24.917
and that's when
you'll need 'em the most.

21:24.951 --> 21:27.954
So, from all of us at Jackpot,
good luck,

21:27.987 --> 21:31.157
wherever your adventures
may take you.

21:31.190 --> 21:34.527
You're hitching a ride with us?

21:34.561 --> 21:36.262
Is this your first time
going to Hong Kong?

21:36.295 --> 21:38.197
It's my first time
going anywhere.

21:38.230 --> 21:39.499
How long are you going for?

21:39.532 --> 21:42.134
I haven't decided.

21:42.168 --> 21:44.170
About a lot of things.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.914
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

21:56.916 --> 21:59.018
You've hit the jackpot
with LA to Vegas.

21:59.051 --> 22:01.421
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

22:03.590 --> 22:05.558
(beeps)
911. What's your emergency?

22:05.592 --> 22:08.194
MAN (on phone):
I'm on Flight 46,
and we're going down.

22:08.227 --> 22:10.997
Just tell my wife
I'm so sorry that I cannot
come home to you.

22:11.030 --> 22:12.064
Hello?

22:14.200 --> 22:17.169
This is your family.
We got you, okay?

22:18.838 --> 22:19.972
Rapid response now!

22:20.006 --> 22:22.909
-We can't save everyone.
-Says who?

22:22.942 --> 22:25.177
It's time we showed Gotham
who we are.
