[¶¶]

00:08.083 --> 00:09.425
[phone ringing]

00:11.328 --> 00:13.137
[phone ringing]

00:15.516 --> 00:18.166
Natalie Rogers,
events planning.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.852
Yes, Mrs. Miller.

00:19.928 --> 00:21.762
I confirmed the
venue this morning.

00:21.914 --> 00:23.355
You're all set for
your Christmas party.

00:25.934 --> 00:28.527
Natalie Rogers,
travel consultant.

00:28.604 --> 00:31.363
Hey, Mr. Walker,
how were your flights?

00:31.515 --> 00:32.589
I'm so glad.

00:32.608 --> 00:33.607
Yeah, you know,

00:33.759 --> 00:34.867
you can always string some
lights

00:35.018 --> 00:36.452
around a palm tree and
call it Christmas.

00:37.613 --> 00:40.522
Natalie Rogers,
custom gift-wrapping.

00:40.541 --> 00:43.042
Yes, I will be dropping those
off in about

00:43.193 --> 00:45.936
15 minutes.

00:45.954 --> 00:47.695
Mr. Ortiz!

00:47.715 --> 00:49.956
I finished the wreath
for your food truck.

00:50.109 --> 00:51.108
Even if the weather is
frightful,

00:51.126 --> 00:53.052
the chilies will keep you warm.

00:53.203 --> 00:54.294
Look.

00:54.446 --> 00:56.204
Muchas gracias.

00:56.223 --> 00:57.130
Wendy!

00:57.283 --> 00:58.540
Oh!

00:58.559 --> 01:01.060
Christmas cards,
addressed

01:01.136 --> 01:02.636
and stamped.

01:02.788 --> 01:04.121
Oh, I--

01:04.139 --> 01:05.956
Pop them in the mail and the let
the mailman do the rest.

01:05.974 --> 01:07.900
Thank you so much,
they're beautiful.

01:08.051 --> 01:10.402
Oh, I love hand-addressed cards,

01:10.554 --> 01:11.886
but with my penmanship

01:11.906 --> 01:14.222
no one would get them until
July.

01:14.241 --> 01:15.407
Well, I threw
in a couple of extra

01:15.484 --> 01:17.150
for Joshy and Becca

01:17.303 --> 01:18.744
direct from the North Pole.

01:18.895 --> 01:19.411
They'll be thrilled.

01:19.488 --> 01:20.562
Thank you so much.

01:20.581 --> 01:21.805
You're welcome.

01:21.824 --> 01:23.064
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas, Wendy.

01:23.142 --> 01:24.658
Yeah, took a little
creativity but you know

01:24.810 --> 01:27.419
I love a challenge.
Merry Christmas.

01:27.571 --> 01:30.422
Natalie, Sparky would be
so glad

01:30.499 --> 01:31.423
to see you.

01:31.500 --> 01:32.758
Come here.

01:32.909 --> 01:35.577
Sparky, your favorite
sitter is here.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.262
Hello, handsome.

01:37.414 --> 01:38.931
And these clothes.

01:39.007 --> 01:41.600
Who doesn't love to get all
dressed up for the holidays?

01:41.751 --> 01:46.012
We want to take him on a
Christmas cruise,

01:46.165 --> 01:49.608
but he gets terrible
sea-sickness.

01:49.685 --> 01:51.777
Well,
I am happy to.

01:51.854 --> 01:53.837
We are gonna have
a great time!

01:53.856 --> 01:56.340
We're gonna watch
It's a Wonderful Woof,

01:56.358 --> 01:58.450
and lap up eggnog, and sing
Christmas carols.

01:58.602 --> 02:00.010
[dog barks]

02:00.012 --> 02:02.287
See, he already knows
the opening to Jingle Bells.

02:02.439 --> 02:05.082
You're the best pet-sitter
anywhere we've ever had.

02:06.034 --> 02:07.459
[Natalie]
Thank you.

02:07.611 --> 02:09.019
[Girl's mom]
Natalie, thank you so much
for doing this.

02:09.037 --> 02:10.370
Of course.

02:10.522 --> 02:12.131
Are you sure I can't convince
you to come work for me?

02:12.207 --> 02:14.299
Thank you, but
I already have a job.

02:14.376 --> 02:15.801
You have eight jobs.

02:15.878 --> 02:17.194
That was just the
last time I counted.

02:17.212 --> 02:19.863
May have added
one or two since then.

02:19.882 --> 02:22.366
But why can't I since
I'm the Jacklyn of all trades.

02:22.384 --> 02:24.459
When are you gonna settle down
on one career?

02:24.478 --> 02:26.311
I don't know,
but I figure

02:26.388 --> 02:28.388
when I find the perfect thing,
I'll know it.

02:28.540 --> 02:30.131
And until then
I'm happy as I am.

02:30.151 --> 02:31.316
Well, I hope
you're not still waiting

02:31.468 --> 02:33.485
on the perfect thing
to do for Christmas.

02:33.562 --> 02:34.653
Thank you, but
I'm gonna spend Christmas

02:34.804 --> 02:36.488
with my cousin Olivia.

02:36.640 --> 02:37.990
I should probably
get going.

02:38.141 --> 02:40.325
Miles to go before I sleep
or at least a few more blocks.

02:40.402 --> 02:41.568
[chuckles]

02:41.720 --> 02:43.720
Be a good doggie, okay.

02:43.722 --> 02:44.830
Merry Christmas.

02:44.981 --> 02:46.481
Merry Christmas.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.225
Let's go, Sparky.

02:48.243 --> 02:49.168
Bye, Sparky.

02:49.244 --> 02:50.727
Bye.

02:50.746 --> 02:53.672
[phone ringing]

02:53.823 --> 02:55.674
Natalie Rogers,
custom wreaths or um,

02:55.751 --> 02:57.083
travel consultant.

02:57.236 --> 02:58.084
[Olivia]
Hi, it's Olivia.

02:58.237 --> 02:59.736
Olivia.

02:59.755 --> 03:01.180
I was just
talking about you.

03:01.331 --> 03:03.498
Are you back
from Rome yet?

03:03.517 --> 03:06.576
[Olivia]
No, I am not back from Rome.

03:06.595 --> 03:08.245
Uh, I guess you haven't
been following the news,

03:08.263 --> 03:09.504
have you?

03:09.523 --> 03:11.857
It's the big chill,
the new Ice Age.

03:13.101 --> 03:14.026
What are you talking about?

03:14.102 --> 03:15.343
I'm stranded here.

03:15.362 --> 03:16.862
Oh no.

03:17.013 --> 03:19.606
Yeah, looks like I won't be home
for Christmas, I'm so sorry.

03:19.758 --> 03:22.534
It's okay, it's um
I'll miss you,

03:22.611 --> 03:24.203
but don't worry about me,
lots of friends have offered to

03:24.354 --> 03:26.596
spend their Christmases
with me.

03:26.615 --> 03:27.597
[sighs]

03:27.616 --> 03:29.266
But are you okay?

03:29.268 --> 03:31.785
Yeah, but I wanted to kinda keep
this as a surprise,

03:33.214 --> 03:35.772
you know how I've been wanting
to open my restaurant for years.

03:35.774 --> 03:38.124
Well, I finally convinced
Chef Grimaldi to come over

03:38.277 --> 03:41.111
to Pine Valley
and be my partner.

03:41.129 --> 03:42.870
I remember him
from when you took me to

03:42.890 --> 03:44.389
Italy when I was little girl.

03:44.541 --> 03:46.225
I always thought he looked
just like Santa Claus.

03:46.301 --> 03:48.710
Oh, uh, so

03:48.729 --> 03:50.729
my plan was to open
on Christmas Eve

03:50.806 --> 03:53.232
with a big traditional
feast of Natale.

03:53.308 --> 03:54.808
You know how it is
in small towns, nothing is

03:54.960 --> 03:56.643
ever open on Christmas
and there's always

03:56.795 --> 03:58.962
a few people with no
place to go.

03:58.981 --> 04:00.964
No one should
be alone on Christmas.

04:00.983 --> 04:03.133
[Olivia]
Yeah, I feel terrible.

04:03.151 --> 04:04.892
We already had a handful
of reservations I'm gonna

04:04.912 --> 04:06.912
have to cancel, there's no
way Chef Grimaldi

04:07.063 --> 04:08.638
can do it on his own.

04:08.657 --> 04:11.141
Oh, I'm so sorry.

04:11.143 --> 04:12.918
Yeah, me too.

04:12.995 --> 04:15.754
Well, I wanted to let you
know, Merry Christmas.

04:15.905 --> 04:17.214
Merry Christmas, Olivia.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.167
[sighs]

04:21.320 --> 04:23.428
Problems are just opportunities
in work clothes.

04:30.271 --> 04:32.271
Hi, Mrs. Myers.

04:32.422 --> 04:35.256
This is Natalie Rogers,
Olivia's cousin.

04:35.276 --> 04:36.942
I have an idea.

04:37.093 --> 04:38.610
What do you know about
this restaurant

04:38.762 --> 04:40.112
she's planning on opening?

05:21.322 --> 05:23.280
[sighs]

05:25.400 --> 05:27.141
Come here.

05:27.161 --> 05:28.327
Come on.

05:31.073 --> 05:32.914
Alright.

05:52.578 --> 05:53.852
[sighs]

05:55.171 --> 05:57.356
Olivia always was
an optimist.

06:14.116 --> 06:15.957
Chef Rivaldi?

06:19.863 --> 06:21.213
You stay here.

06:21.364 --> 06:22.789
All dogs might go to
heaven but they should

06:22.941 --> 06:25.133
probably stay out of
restaurant kitchens.

07:03.090 --> 07:03.922
Stop right there,
you

07:04.073 --> 07:05.924
Ow!

07:06.001 --> 07:08.844
[speaking Italian]

07:11.673 --> 07:13.657
No, don't, let me go!

07:13.675 --> 07:15.434
[speaking Italian]

07:16.937 --> 07:19.396
Oh, that's so much better.

07:20.590 --> 07:21.898
Are you hurt?

07:27.839 --> 07:28.780
What?

07:28.932 --> 07:30.507
Are you hurt?

07:30.525 --> 07:31.524
No, no.

07:31.677 --> 07:32.784
No.

07:32.861 --> 07:34.268
II think it's fine.

07:34.288 --> 07:36.513
Now get outta
my kitchen, presto.

07:36.531 --> 07:38.865
Your kitchen, this is my cousin
Olivia's kitchen.

07:39.017 --> 07:41.460
So Olivia has a cousin?

07:41.536 --> 07:44.187
And the restaurant may
be hers, but the kitchen

07:44.189 --> 07:45.872
always belongs
to the chef.

07:46.024 --> 07:48.800
You can't be Chef Grimaldi.

07:48.952 --> 07:51.044
You're nothing
like Santa Claus.

07:51.196 --> 07:52.712
[laughs]

07:52.864 --> 07:54.306
Oh, you're thinking
of my uncle,

07:54.457 --> 07:56.308
Zio Lorenzo Grimaldi.

07:56.384 --> 07:59.202
Maybe I just look like my
[speaks Italian].

07:59.221 --> 08:00.704
But he was too old to
come to America,

08:00.722 --> 08:02.981
so I came instead.

08:03.058 --> 08:05.817
Sorry, I'm his nephew
Stefano Grimaldi.

08:05.969 --> 08:07.152
Ow.

08:07.229 --> 08:08.878
Uh, sorry.

08:08.897 --> 08:10.655
Uh, I don't know
the name of you.

08:10.732 --> 08:11.715
I'm Natalie.

08:11.733 --> 08:12.716
Rogers.

08:12.718 --> 08:14.326
Olivia's cousin.

08:14.477 --> 08:16.720
Oh, I should've known.

08:16.738 --> 08:18.571
See Olivia told me her
cousin was

08:18.724 --> 08:20.332
[inhales]

08:20.483 --> 08:21.500
la bella signorina.

08:21.576 --> 08:23.168
[chuckles]

08:23.245 --> 08:26.229
Oh, that's very nice of her.

08:26.248 --> 08:27.839
[sniffles]

08:27.916 --> 08:31.009
Oh, and it's very true.

08:31.086 --> 08:33.903
But what were you doing uh,
sneaking around my kitchen?

08:33.922 --> 08:35.329
I wasn't sneaking.

08:35.349 --> 08:37.015
Then that's not the word
for it,

08:37.166 --> 08:39.242
the sneaking and creeping.

08:39.261 --> 08:40.927
No, I wasn't doing any of those
thing,

08:41.079 --> 08:42.095
I was just looking
for the chef.

08:42.247 --> 08:44.689
[Mrs. Myers]
Yoohoo!

08:44.841 --> 08:46.191
Is anybody here?

08:48.177 --> 08:50.028
Mrs. Myers.

08:50.105 --> 08:51.196
Thanks for coming.

08:51.273 --> 08:52.589
Have you met my
cousin's best friend?

08:52.607 --> 08:54.015
-Hi.
-This is Mrs. Anna Myers.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.034
Stefano!

08:56.185 --> 08:58.870
[speaks in Italian]

08:59.022 --> 09:01.873
Oh, I see you have.

09:02.025 --> 09:04.601
And another one.

09:04.619 --> 09:07.379
What third time's
not a charm?

09:07.530 --> 09:09.548
Stefano's quite charming
enough.

09:09.699 --> 09:10.882
And who is this?

09:10.959 --> 09:12.384
[Natalie]
Sparky.

09:12.535 --> 09:14.386
I'm pet-sitting
for the holidays.

09:14.537 --> 09:16.221
Well, it was nice
to see you, huh.

09:16.372 --> 09:17.781
And to meet you, Sparky.

09:17.799 --> 09:19.724
But I must go otherwise my
sauce, huh, it will burn

09:19.801 --> 09:20.967
if I don't get back.

09:21.119 --> 09:22.710
-Oh, I just need to talk to you.
-No!

09:22.729 --> 09:24.971
A chef will never
let his food burn.

09:25.123 --> 09:26.898
Not for anything.

09:26.975 --> 09:28.024
Mamma mia.

09:30.462 --> 09:31.628
[Natalie]
Well, fine then.

09:31.646 --> 09:33.405
I brought your cousin's spare
keys, I'm sure

09:33.481 --> 09:34.906
she won't mind if you
stay in her house while

09:34.983 --> 09:35.965
you're here in town.

09:35.984 --> 09:37.224
Thank you.

09:37.244 --> 09:38.893
I really wanna go through
with the grand opening

09:38.912 --> 09:41.079
just as planned.

09:41.156 --> 09:42.305
[sighs]

09:42.324 --> 09:44.641
Well, there's a lot of
work to be done.

09:44.659 --> 09:46.918
Every problem is an opportunity
in disguise.

09:47.070 --> 09:48.645
If you insist.

09:48.663 --> 09:49.979
Well, let's get you settled in
and I'll tell you

09:49.998 --> 09:52.148
what I know of her plans.

09:52.167 --> 09:53.741
Unless I was
interrupting something.

09:53.760 --> 09:54.667
What?

09:54.820 --> 09:55.927
No.

09:56.004 --> 09:58.597
He's a very handsome man.

09:58.673 --> 10:00.265
He's a very grumpy man.

10:00.416 --> 10:02.083
He yelled at
me in Italian.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.436
And he doesn't even
look like Santa Claus.

10:04.512 --> 10:05.604
[sighs]

10:05.680 --> 10:06.663
What a cute store.

10:06.681 --> 10:08.422
I know, lovely.

10:08.442 --> 10:09.774
So nice.

10:09.851 --> 10:11.276
You know, Olivia asked
me to cancel all

10:11.427 --> 10:12.836
of the Christmas reservations

10:12.854 --> 10:13.945
but if you're really
serious

10:14.022 --> 10:15.505
You bet I'm serious.

10:15.523 --> 10:17.674
Olivia didn't wanna let
anyone down on Christmas

10:17.692 --> 10:19.509
and neither do I.

10:19.511 --> 10:21.511
Beebee, hello!

10:21.529 --> 10:22.787
Hi, Mrs. Myers.

10:22.864 --> 10:24.180
Beebee's one of my students.

10:24.199 --> 10:26.273
This is my good friend's
cousin, Natalie.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.517
How are you doing, Beebee?

10:27.535 --> 10:29.185
Uh, not's so good.

10:29.204 --> 10:31.521
I was hoping to get some temp
work in over vacation,

10:31.539 --> 10:32.797
but it seems
like everyone in town has

10:32.874 --> 10:34.115
already hired
the holiday help.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.467
Too bad.

10:35.618 --> 10:36.635
I'll keep an ear around.

10:36.786 --> 10:38.027
Thanks, Mrs. Myers.

10:38.046 --> 10:41.047
It was nice to meet
you, Ms. Natalie.

10:41.199 --> 10:43.366
Oh, there's
someone you should know,

10:43.385 --> 10:46.202
Miles Croaker, he's out
town culture vulture.

10:46.221 --> 10:47.795
[Natalie]
Culture vulture?

10:47.814 --> 10:50.707
You know, he oversees
all the town events,

10:50.725 --> 10:52.317
concerts and reviews
everything from

10:52.468 --> 10:54.152
the high school musical to
the local restaurants

10:54.303 --> 10:55.320
for the paper.

10:55.471 --> 10:57.471
Restaurant reviews, huh.

10:57.491 --> 11:00.158
He's tough, but fair
and very well-respected.

11:00.235 --> 11:02.994
He can make it work for
anyone in this town.

11:03.146 --> 11:04.329
[Miles]
Phew.

11:04.480 --> 11:06.890
Miles, dear,

11:06.908 --> 11:08.391
what's the matter?

11:08.410 --> 11:09.817
I haven't seen you this
distraught since the

11:09.836 --> 11:12.061
fizzing fireworks
fiasco of '09.

11:12.080 --> 11:15.064
Oh, it's this
Roman snow-blow.

11:15.083 --> 11:17.400
Oh, the blizzard
that hit Rome.

11:17.419 --> 11:19.402
Yeah, my cousin's stuck
there for Christmas.

11:19.421 --> 11:21.162
Oh, this storm's
has wreaked havoc on air

11:21.181 --> 11:22.681
travel all over the world.

11:22.757 --> 11:24.741
And in in Christmas.

11:24.743 --> 11:27.093
Oh, our touring carolers
just heard that flights home

11:27.245 --> 11:29.187
are canceled and
can't be rescheduled until

11:29.264 --> 11:31.022
after the holiday.

11:31.099 --> 11:33.191
It's terrible to be away
from home on Christmas.

11:33.342 --> 11:35.251
Hmm, yes, I was
hoping they'd be able to

11:35.270 --> 11:38.029
celebrate in the café,
it's closed on Christmas.

11:38.106 --> 11:39.756
Are most places closed then?

11:39.774 --> 11:41.199
Yes, all of them.

11:41.276 --> 11:43.109
Our poor carolers aren't
just stranded without

11:43.261 --> 11:45.094
their loved ones,

11:45.113 --> 11:47.872
but must also eat microwave
turkey dinners.

11:47.949 --> 11:49.207
Ew.

11:49.284 --> 11:50.767
[Miles]
Mm-mm.

11:50.769 --> 11:53.102
Can you please excuse me
I must call my travel agents

11:53.121 --> 11:55.797
again and see if there's
anything they can do.

11:57.125 --> 11:58.775
Those poor carolers.

11:58.793 --> 11:59.718
I don't suppose
you can do anything

11:59.869 --> 12:01.886
for their travel
agent front?

12:01.963 --> 12:03.555
I already tried
for my cousin Olivia,

12:03.631 --> 12:05.640
everything's locked up.

12:09.730 --> 12:10.895
[Natalie sighs]

12:11.047 --> 12:12.230
[Natalie]
It looks so beautiful.

12:12.381 --> 12:13.565
[Mrs. Myers chuckles]

12:13.641 --> 12:15.808
You know Olivia,
she always has to set up

12:15.961 --> 12:18.570
her decorations right after
Thanksgiving

12:18.646 --> 12:21.406
that way Christmas can last as
long as possible.

12:21.483 --> 12:23.658
[laughing]

12:24.745 --> 12:26.135
[sighs]

12:26.154 --> 12:28.896
You know she'd be here
if she could.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.473
Yeah.

12:30.492 --> 12:32.751
I know.

12:32.827 --> 12:34.419
I just can't remember the
last time I celebrated

12:34.570 --> 12:36.996
Christmas without her.

12:37.148 --> 12:38.882
[sighs]

12:40.335 --> 12:41.426
Oh, do you wanna stay
for dinner?

12:41.503 --> 12:43.094
Of course.

12:43.171 --> 12:45.655
I'm sure you can find something
in the freezer to cook.

12:45.673 --> 12:47.248
[chuckles]

12:47.267 --> 12:49.601
Cook?

12:49.752 --> 12:52.178
You did just wanna have a grand
restaurant opening, right?

12:52.330 --> 12:53.997
[laughs]

12:54.015 --> 12:56.691
Yeah, I just didn't think
I would be the one cooking.

13:00.763 --> 13:01.762
I better take this.

13:01.782 --> 13:04.357
Go ahead, make
yourself at home.

13:04.509 --> 13:06.009
Hey.

13:06.027 --> 13:08.011
I know.

13:08.029 --> 13:09.621
[sighs]

13:09.772 --> 13:11.623
Lasagne.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.797
Dishwasher,
this is the oven?

13:33.371 --> 13:35.555
I tried that one.

13:35.707 --> 13:37.464
Okay.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.984
Back to planning
Pezzo Di Parma.

13:57.745 --> 13:59.671
Who could that be?

14:04.419 --> 14:06.919
-Stefano.
-Ciao, Natalie.

14:07.072 --> 14:09.514
Uh, I made a sauce but uh,
now there is no one to eat it,

14:09.665 --> 14:11.850
so I thought maybe

14:12.001 --> 14:13.351
if you don't have any plans
for dinner,

14:13.502 --> 14:15.578
you can have.

14:15.597 --> 14:17.856
And some bone for
the cagnolino.

14:18.007 --> 14:20.674
Doggie bag for the doggie that's
very thoughtful, thank you.

14:20.694 --> 14:23.862
Prego.

14:23.938 --> 14:26.698
Oh, do you wanna come in
and join us for dinner?

14:26.849 --> 14:28.349
There's gotta be plenty.

14:28.368 --> 14:29.592
Are you sure?

14:29.611 --> 14:30.535
Yeah, I was just making
a lasa--

14:30.686 --> 14:32.111
[smoke alarm beeping]

14:32.263 --> 14:33.705
Oh no, the lasagne.

14:36.117 --> 14:37.375
Oh.

14:40.288 --> 14:42.672
Ooh, no!

14:45.793 --> 14:48.678
[coughing]

14:53.226 --> 14:54.708
[Natalie screams]

14:54.728 --> 14:56.728
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.

14:56.879 --> 14:59.546
[speaking Italian]

14:59.566 --> 15:01.900
What are you
what is going on here?

15:02.051 --> 15:04.885
I was just thawing
the lasagne

15:04.905 --> 15:06.404
and then I got uh,

15:06.481 --> 15:08.573
distracted researching
for the grand opening

15:08.724 --> 15:10.909
and I guess I just forgot.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.411
Forgot?

15:13.488 --> 15:14.561
Forgot.

15:14.581 --> 15:15.821
Do you forget to breathe?

15:15.974 --> 15:18.141
Does your heart
forget to pump?

15:18.143 --> 15:20.567
How can you be
cooking and forget?

15:20.587 --> 15:22.420
I'm not much of a cook.

15:24.257 --> 15:27.258
But I found so many
wonderful ideas, I didn't

15:27.335 --> 15:30.261
realize how elaborate
the feast of Natale is.

15:30.338 --> 15:32.430
There's a beautiful
celebration and everybody

15:32.507 --> 15:34.599
comes together for a big
Christmas meal that lasts

15:34.750 --> 15:37.009
for hours and hours
with um,

15:37.162 --> 15:39.178
antipasto, and salad,

15:39.330 --> 15:41.681
and meats,
and sweetbreads.

15:41.833 --> 15:42.832
Mhmm.

15:42.834 --> 15:45.835
And candied
nuts, and wine, music.

15:45.853 --> 15:47.261
I thought we could
decorate the whole place

15:47.280 --> 15:49.906
like a Tuscan villa but
with Christmas touches like a

15:52.601 --> 15:54.268
Mm.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.362
[Mrs. Myers]
Looks like

15:56.514 --> 15:57.455
Mmm.

15:57.606 --> 15:59.958
Your mystery pasta worked
its magic again.

16:00.034 --> 16:01.459
[chuckles]

16:01.536 --> 16:04.036
It's so

16:04.189 --> 16:05.922
[grunts]

16:07.450 --> 16:09.968
There's parsley and oregano.

16:10.044 --> 16:11.469
What else?

16:11.620 --> 16:13.029
It will be la specialità
Italia de casa

16:13.047 --> 16:15.139
when we finally open
Pezzo Di Parma.

16:16.868 --> 16:18.810
If we ever open.

16:18.886 --> 16:20.219
Madame.

16:20.371 --> 16:22.038
Of course,
you're gonna open.

16:22.056 --> 16:23.314
And just in time.

16:23.391 --> 16:24.298
Just in time for Christmas.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.541
What?

16:25.543 --> 16:27.318
Yeah, like you
and Olivia planned.

16:27.470 --> 16:29.378
No, it's impossible.

16:29.380 --> 16:32.381
We have three days until
Christmas, we we-we

16:32.400 --> 16:34.400
we have nothing prepared,
we have no staff,

16:34.552 --> 16:36.552
no no decoration.

16:36.571 --> 16:38.162
No food prepared,
it's impossible.

16:38.239 --> 16:39.980
No, I have a lot of really good
ideas, if I

16:40.000 --> 16:41.982
Stefano's right, Natalie.

16:42.002 --> 16:44.227
It's a lovely idea,
but we don't have enough time

16:44.245 --> 16:45.561
to get it done.

16:45.580 --> 16:47.797
-It's okay.
-Maybe you're right.

16:50.568 --> 16:51.843
Is it coriander?

16:54.347 --> 16:55.513
Fennel?

16:55.590 --> 16:57.498
Oh, come on,
you have to tell me.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.666
If I tell you, it will not be
a mystery sauce anymore, right?

16:59.686 --> 17:01.185
Mhmm.

17:01.337 --> 17:03.354
But please.

17:03.431 --> 17:05.839
Turmeric?

17:05.859 --> 17:08.675
Paprika?

17:08.695 --> 17:11.587
Na Natalie, the thing to
guess is the

17:11.606 --> 17:13.698
a little
bit in the cook.

17:13.849 --> 17:14.924
Unlike your lasagne.

17:14.942 --> 17:16.492
Capito.

17:21.449 --> 17:23.690
[Stefano]
Natalie, good morning.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.043
Morning.

17:25.119 --> 17:27.270
I fancy you're gonna need
our reservation book?

17:27.288 --> 17:29.288
I better get started on those
cancellations.

17:29.440 --> 17:30.381
Hmm.

17:30.533 --> 17:32.124
Mr. Croaker, good morning!

17:32.277 --> 17:34.052
Well, good morning.

17:34.203 --> 17:36.462
I heard a rumor that your
cousin's restaurant might

17:36.614 --> 17:38.723
be open for Christmas and
I thought I'd come

17:38.800 --> 17:40.558
to see for myself.

17:40.635 --> 17:43.135
I'm afraid that's just
a rumor.

17:43.288 --> 17:45.137
Oh, well, worth a try.

17:45.290 --> 17:46.547
[laughs]

17:46.566 --> 17:49.067
Oh, uh, sorry,
my dear.

17:49.143 --> 17:51.961
This is Ariella Cancio,
one of our touring carolers.

17:51.979 --> 17:53.237
-Hello.
-Buongiorno.

17:53.389 --> 17:56.199
[speaking Italian]

18:03.732 --> 18:05.491
Oh uh, I'm so sorry,

18:05.643 --> 18:07.418
I forget my manners.

18:07.495 --> 18:10.421
Um, I was just saying it
is sad this year,

18:10.498 --> 18:13.424
so many of us have nowhere to go
but um,

18:13.501 --> 18:15.818
meeting someone from the same
part of Italia

18:15.837 --> 18:18.096
it's a little bit of home.

18:18.247 --> 18:20.673
I'm afraid it is sad,
but uh,

18:20.825 --> 18:22.767
there's no way around it.

18:22.918 --> 18:25.661
-Uh, sorry, we don't--
-Yes, there is.

18:25.663 --> 18:27.754
Just a tiny change
of plans.

18:27.774 --> 18:30.666
Mr. Croaker, Ristorante Pezzo Di
Parma would be proud

18:30.685 --> 18:33.686
to host you and all
of the carolers for a big

18:33.838 --> 18:36.614
traditional feast of
Natale dinner on Christmas.

18:36.691 --> 18:39.600
[Miles]
Oh, well, thank you.

18:39.619 --> 18:40.952
[Arielle]
Grazie mille.

18:41.103 --> 18:42.027
[laughing]

18:42.180 --> 18:43.955
-Ci vediamo.
-Ci vediamo.

18:45.867 --> 18:46.940
Are you kidding?

18:46.960 --> 18:48.033
Or do you wanna make
the pasta?

18:48.186 --> 18:49.293
Do you wanna
make the pizza?

18:49.445 --> 18:51.278
What are you
gonna do, huh?

18:51.297 --> 18:52.613
Pazza.

18:52.632 --> 18:53.798
Pazzo.

18:53.949 --> 18:55.466
Oh, but I can help.

18:55.618 --> 18:58.027
Oh my God!

18:58.045 --> 18:59.762
[Natalie]
It's gonna be fine.

19:02.700 --> 19:04.642
[indiscernible speech]

19:04.793 --> 19:07.103
Woman make me crazy, eh.

19:08.314 --> 19:09.480
Tried to tell you
it's impossible,

19:09.632 --> 19:10.815
but you don't listen, huh.

19:10.966 --> 19:12.817
[pots and pans clattering]

19:15.563 --> 19:16.803
Well?

19:16.823 --> 19:18.731
Impossibile, impossibile.

19:18.883 --> 19:19.824
There's always a way.

19:19.975 --> 19:22.660
No, it will be a fiasco.

19:23.888 --> 19:24.829
And that is--

19:24.906 --> 19:26.164
It's the same word
in English

19:26.315 --> 19:27.406
and it will not be
a fiasco,

19:27.558 --> 19:28.891
there is always a way.

19:28.910 --> 19:31.169
Sometime there is no--
there is no way.

19:31.245 --> 19:33.820
Sometime there is a wall,
there's just a big wall

19:33.840 --> 19:36.674
and no ladder, capisce?

19:36.751 --> 19:38.751
Big wall or small,
the best way to get over it

19:38.903 --> 19:41.012
is to start climbing.

19:41.088 --> 19:42.847
[chuckles]

19:44.166 --> 19:45.850
Maybe you are crazy.

19:46.001 --> 19:48.519
If we can pull this off
your mystery sauce alone

19:48.596 --> 19:49.854
is worth a five-star
review.

19:51.024 --> 19:52.190
[Stefano sighs]

19:52.341 --> 19:54.692
Reviews are important.

19:54.769 --> 19:56.694
Many, many restaurant in
America they fail because

19:56.845 --> 19:59.179
of it, I understand.

19:59.199 --> 20:02.107
But I thought,

20:02.260 --> 20:05.036
I thought I would have
more time to plan,

20:05.187 --> 20:06.704
to make everything perfect.

20:06.855 --> 20:09.207
It will be perfect.

20:09.283 --> 20:11.100
And it will be a beautiful
feast of Natale for

20:11.118 --> 20:13.377
a bunch of people that
have nowhere else to go.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.049
[sighs]

20:19.610 --> 20:21.886
I will get my recipes.

20:21.963 --> 20:24.296
-Plan the menu.
-Great.

20:24.449 --> 20:25.223
What should I do?

20:25.374 --> 20:27.633
You?

20:27.785 --> 20:30.377
You look for a rope.

20:30.396 --> 20:33.456
Even if can get up that
wall,

20:33.458 --> 20:36.192
Natalie, we still need
a way down.

20:48.823 --> 20:51.657
[Natalie]
Okay, read me the list again.

20:51.809 --> 20:54.234
[Beebee]
Décor, so all this.

20:54.254 --> 20:55.419
Food.

20:55.496 --> 20:57.421
Oh, that's Stefano's
department.

20:57.573 --> 20:59.982
Believe me, you do not
want me doing the cooking.

20:59.984 --> 21:02.151
Menus.

21:02.169 --> 21:03.577
I can do those.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.412
Beautiful handwritten
menus will be great, right?

21:05.431 --> 21:07.265
Yeah.

21:07.341 --> 21:09.416
Staffing.

21:09.435 --> 21:11.327
Staffing.

21:11.329 --> 21:13.396
Well, we aren't gonna have
a formal service for just five,

21:14.999 --> 21:16.348
but we're definitely
gonna need some help now

21:16.501 --> 21:19.018
even going family style.

21:19.170 --> 21:21.762
Who do you think we can get
this close to Christmas?

21:21.781 --> 21:24.507
Well, there's this guy
in my class.

21:24.509 --> 21:26.117
Tyler.

21:26.193 --> 21:27.768
But I don't know him that well.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.436
Oh, then what
makes you think--

21:29.455 --> 21:30.863
Well, his cousin Melissa
told me that his folks

21:31.015 --> 21:32.848
were going out of town, he was
supposed to join them

21:32.867 --> 21:34.533
once school was out, but then
I heard from Joanna that

21:34.685 --> 21:36.443
all the flights were canceled
due to the snowstorm in Italy.

21:36.462 --> 21:37.795
And last year he was helping
stock shelves

21:37.946 --> 21:39.538
at the hardware store, but then
I heard from Carol

21:39.690 --> 21:41.373
that he didn't take the job this
year, 'cause he didn't

21:41.526 --> 21:42.525
think he'd be around.

21:42.543 --> 21:43.467
But you don't know him
very well?

21:43.619 --> 21:45.861
Not really.

21:45.880 --> 21:47.713
This Tyler, he's um pretty
cute, huh?

21:47.865 --> 21:48.973
Yeah.

21:49.124 --> 21:51.884
I mean I guess, I never
really paid attention

21:52.036 --> 21:53.811
all that much.

21:53.962 --> 21:56.889
Does he have curly
brown hair?

21:57.041 --> 21:59.725
Mhmm, I mean I--
I don't know him that well.

21:59.877 --> 22:02.728
And warm puppy dog eyes?

22:02.880 --> 22:04.822
Yeah.

22:06.717 --> 22:08.400
How did you know that?

22:08.553 --> 22:11.070
Um, because there's a cute boy

22:11.222 --> 22:12.830
with curly brown hair

22:12.981 --> 22:14.073
over there pretending
not to notice you

22:14.225 --> 22:15.315
for the last 10 minutes.

22:15.335 --> 22:16.892
Where?

22:16.911 --> 22:19.745
What, no, no don't
don't point.

22:19.897 --> 22:21.672
[Beebee sighs]

22:21.824 --> 22:22.915
Please tell me
he didn't see me.

22:23.067 --> 22:24.900
I think he sounds
like a great candidate.

22:24.902 --> 22:26.493
Why don't you go offer
him the job?

22:26.512 --> 22:27.586
I can't do that.

22:27.738 --> 22:29.088
You should be the
one to do that.

22:29.240 --> 22:31.182
As my assistant, I'm delegating
my task to you.

22:31.333 --> 22:32.591
No, but I wouldn't even know
what to say.

22:32.743 --> 22:34.018
You'll be fine, go on,
I'll help you.

22:34.095 --> 22:35.186
-Please, no.
-I'll help you.

22:49.777 --> 22:51.610
Tyler!

22:51.762 --> 22:54.538
Hi, it's Beebee.

22:54.615 --> 22:56.374
Jordan.

22:56.450 --> 22:57.375
From school.

22:57.451 --> 22:59.618
You know?

22:59.770 --> 23:01.879
Oh, Beebee, hi, uh.

23:03.198 --> 23:05.883
Yo, what's uh,
what's up?

23:07.887 --> 23:10.721
I'm so sorry, uh.

23:12.800 --> 23:14.116
What's up?

23:14.135 --> 23:16.135
Not much.

23:16.287 --> 23:17.119
How are you?

23:17.138 --> 23:19.304
I'm cool.

23:19.457 --> 23:20.523
-What's that?
-No.

23:23.218 --> 23:25.144
Just some reindeer went by,

23:25.296 --> 23:26.237
you know, no big deal.

23:26.388 --> 23:27.813
Reindeer, right.

23:27.965 --> 23:30.241
Oh, I was wondering if you
wanted a job for the holidays?

23:30.392 --> 23:31.391
[chuckling]

23:31.411 --> 23:33.969
You'd be working with me.

23:33.988 --> 23:35.413
Not every second.

23:35.489 --> 23:37.581
Just sometimes.

23:37.733 --> 23:38.899
Only when we had to.

23:38.918 --> 23:40.993
Uh, well,
schp sch sure.

23:41.145 --> 23:42.995
Yeah, that'd be cool.

23:43.147 --> 23:44.329
-What's the
-[Beebee] Cool.

23:44.482 --> 23:45.756
What's the job?

23:45.908 --> 23:48.333
What is it?

23:48.486 --> 23:49.409
-Miming.
-Miming, uh,

23:49.429 --> 23:52.096
I I I don't--

23:52.247 --> 23:54.598
Serving food
in a restaurant.

23:55.826 --> 23:57.083
That yes, that I can do.

23:57.103 --> 23:59.178
Yeah.

23:59.330 --> 24:01.755
Good, 'cause there's also...

24:01.774 --> 24:03.182
drumming.

24:03.334 --> 24:05.350
Um.

24:05.503 --> 24:07.002
Cooking!

24:07.004 --> 24:09.855
Cooking, helping
cook in the kitchen.

24:10.007 --> 24:11.264
I like to cook.

24:11.284 --> 24:12.858
-Good.
-Yeah.

24:13.010 --> 24:15.453
'Cause there also might be--

24:15.604 --> 24:17.362
You know what,

24:17.515 --> 24:19.290
here's my boss
Ms. Natalie right now.

24:20.442 --> 24:22.251
Hey, Tyler.

24:23.037 --> 24:24.795
Hi.

24:24.872 --> 24:26.689
Beebee's told me a lot
about you even though

24:26.707 --> 24:28.424
she doesn't
know you very well.

24:29.710 --> 24:30.801
Uh.

24:30.878 --> 24:32.044
I think if you're
interested in the job,

24:32.196 --> 24:33.712
you'd be a great fit.

24:33.864 --> 24:35.364
It sounds great.

24:35.382 --> 24:37.457
[Natalie]
Great um, why don't you
head on over to

24:37.477 --> 24:38.717
Pezzo Di Parma, I'll let
Stefano know

24:38.869 --> 24:40.385
you're on your way.

24:40.538 --> 24:42.813
Thanks, Ms. Natalie,

24:42.965 --> 24:44.798
uh thank you.

24:44.817 --> 24:47.209
Um, thanks Beebee.

24:47.211 --> 24:49.320
I'll uh,
I'll see you later.

24:54.235 --> 24:55.993
[laughs]

24:59.665 --> 25:01.073
[Stefano]
Andiamo, Tyler.

25:01.225 --> 25:03.650
Dry storage and cold
storage,

25:03.669 --> 25:05.577
prepping area.

25:05.730 --> 25:07.563
Prepping area.

25:07.565 --> 25:10.341
Hot line, cold line,
plating area.

25:10.417 --> 25:12.176
-Capito?
-Yeah.

25:12.327 --> 25:14.512
Love, life, and
cooking is all the same.

25:14.663 --> 25:17.181
It's logical.

25:17.332 --> 25:19.850
I'm looking at your face
and I see you don't understand.

25:19.927 --> 25:21.685
Uh, no, no, I get
that cooking has to be

25:21.837 --> 25:24.146
logical, but love?

25:25.358 --> 25:28.250
Okay, I will use
myself as an example.

25:28.269 --> 25:29.175
Tyler, I already know
the woman

25:29.195 --> 25:31.436
I will fall in love with.

25:31.589 --> 25:32.679
How can you know that?

25:32.698 --> 25:33.939
Logic.

25:34.091 --> 25:35.591
I know it will be someone
who will help me raise

25:35.593 --> 25:37.350
our children to speak Italian,

25:37.370 --> 25:39.111
who wants to live
where I live,

25:39.263 --> 25:41.930
and love cooking
as much as I do.

25:41.932 --> 25:44.208
So we can share our
second passion, pasta.

25:45.378 --> 25:48.287
Okay, but
what about you know,

25:48.439 --> 25:49.863
attraction?

25:49.882 --> 25:52.775
Ah, you want a bella
signorina, of course.

25:52.793 --> 25:54.276
[Tyler chuckling]

25:54.278 --> 25:56.128
But not every bella
signorina is the right

25:56.280 --> 25:59.131
bella signorina for you.

25:59.283 --> 26:02.059
That why you need logic.

26:02.136 --> 26:04.562
Wow, I haven't even
thought about what I want.

26:04.713 --> 26:05.637
[Natalie]
Hello?

26:05.790 --> 26:08.732
Ah.

26:08.809 --> 26:10.292
We're back.

26:10.294 --> 26:12.144
We brought enough stuff
to deck the halls.

26:12.296 --> 26:13.145
[Stefano]
Oi.

26:13.297 --> 26:14.572
Not to mention
the dining room.

26:14.723 --> 26:16.723
[indiscernible speech]

26:16.742 --> 26:18.701
and even

26:21.229 --> 26:23.038
you.

26:24.733 --> 26:26.709
Hmm, that smells
delicious.

26:28.236 --> 26:29.402
And we are starving.

26:29.422 --> 26:30.588
Good.

26:30.739 --> 26:32.423
Then you must eat,
it's almost finished.

26:39.915 --> 26:41.673
Is that
the mystery sauce?

26:41.826 --> 26:43.434
Ah.

26:43.585 --> 26:44.843
Did you see
what he put in it?

26:44.995 --> 26:45.936
[Stefano clicking tongue]

26:46.088 --> 26:47.438
Oh, there was some--

26:47.514 --> 26:50.182
There was some green stuff,
and some chopped stuff,

26:50.334 --> 26:52.610
and uh, some other stuff.

26:54.355 --> 26:55.504
Maybe if I eat out
of the pan,

26:55.522 --> 26:56.355
I'll get the mystery
ingredient.

26:56.507 --> 26:57.448
Nah!

26:59.693 --> 27:01.285
Scusi.

27:18.286 --> 27:20.379
Hmm.

27:20.531 --> 27:22.881
Little bit sweet

27:23.033 --> 27:25.884
and a little bit tangy

27:26.036 --> 27:28.887
and just a tiny bit
bitter,

27:29.039 --> 27:30.222
but in a good way
like

27:30.374 --> 27:31.297
Si.

27:31.317 --> 27:32.483
Ginger.

27:32.559 --> 27:34.485
The mystery ingredient
is ginger, right?

27:34.561 --> 27:36.545
Tell me I'm right.

27:36.563 --> 27:38.638
Or maybe thyme.

27:38.658 --> 27:40.324
If I told you

27:40.475 --> 27:42.159
It wouldn't
be a mystery.

27:43.737 --> 27:45.496
What?

27:47.241 --> 27:49.333
It doesn't have thyme,
but it needs it, right?

27:49.484 --> 27:52.127
[speaking Italian]

27:53.564 --> 27:56.173
How could you give me advice on
the pompieri,

27:56.324 --> 27:58.083
the firefighter, they must
put the boots on

27:58.235 --> 27:59.418
when they are coming over, hmm?

27:59.570 --> 28:01.327
Okay, okay.

28:01.347 --> 28:03.922
I'm cooking-challenged.

28:04.074 --> 28:05.999
But when I was a little girl,
Olivia used to make me

28:06.018 --> 28:07.592
taste everything
that she went along.

28:07.745 --> 28:08.686
Oh.

28:08.837 --> 28:11.021
I actually have
a pretty good palate.

28:13.600 --> 28:15.025
This is delicious.

28:15.177 --> 28:17.194
It would be better
if I had Olio d'oliva descadoni.

28:18.605 --> 28:20.439
It's an olive oil we make
in Parma next

28:20.591 --> 28:22.533
to where I come from.

28:22.609 --> 28:24.368
I looked for it everywhere,
I cannot find it.

28:26.263 --> 28:27.538
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

28:27.614 --> 28:28.688
Mamma mia.

28:28.708 --> 28:31.041
Basta.

28:31.118 --> 28:33.711
I still think the mystery
ingredient is ginger.

28:35.381 --> 28:37.214
Turmeric!

28:42.722 --> 28:45.630
I don't know much about
kitchens, but I know

28:45.783 --> 28:47.725
that's not good.

28:47.801 --> 28:50.394
And the plumbing is old here,
it needs an expert touch.

28:57.978 --> 28:59.886
[grunting]

28:59.905 --> 29:00.904
Oh God!

29:01.056 --> 29:03.574
Oh God, oh.

29:06.820 --> 29:08.320
Expert, huh?

29:08.472 --> 29:09.972
Here let me.

29:09.990 --> 29:10.748
[Stefano sighs]

29:23.170 --> 29:26.096
[coughing]

29:29.268 --> 29:32.102
[sighs]

29:34.273 --> 29:35.939
It's probably just
one little pipe.

29:51.015 --> 29:53.749
Tyler, Beebee,
go check the washroom.

29:56.462 --> 29:59.021
Everything's gonna
be fine.

29:59.039 --> 30:00.446
It can't be all
the plumbing.

30:00.466 --> 30:03.542
Why not?

30:03.694 --> 30:05.135
Um, because
it's Christmas.

30:07.455 --> 30:08.639
No water in the ladies room.

30:08.790 --> 30:09.956
Or the men's.

30:09.975 --> 30:11.308
[speaking Italian]

30:11.459 --> 30:13.126
We cannot open a restaurant
without running water.

30:13.979 --> 30:15.312
Problems are just
opportunities in disguise.

30:15.463 --> 30:16.872
No, basta.

30:16.890 --> 30:19.274
The feast of Natale
is off.

30:25.807 --> 30:27.783
[sighs]

30:29.161 --> 30:31.903
[Natalie]
Any chance they'll finish
before Christmas?

30:32.056 --> 30:33.497
Okay, thank you, yeah.

30:33.648 --> 30:35.833
Yeah, Merry Christmas.

30:42.066 --> 30:44.341
Come on, we got this.

30:44.418 --> 30:46.844
This is just a chance to
show our awesomeness.

30:48.088 --> 30:49.346
And we are pretty
dang awesome.

30:49.497 --> 30:50.922
Am I right?

30:51.075 --> 30:52.808
[Mrs. Myers]
Hello!

30:56.856 --> 30:59.005
I brought that tree
skirt you wanted.

30:59.024 --> 31:01.507
Do you know you still have
lasagne on the back stoop?

31:01.527 --> 31:03.360
Uh, thank you.

31:03.511 --> 31:04.936
I'm waiting until spring,
so I can give it

31:05.089 --> 31:06.588
a proper burial.

31:06.590 --> 31:07.756
You're the only person
I know that

31:07.774 --> 31:10.033
uses a smoke alarm
instead of an egg timer.

31:10.110 --> 31:11.201
[chuckling]

31:11.278 --> 31:12.703
Well, good thing
we have Chef Stefano.

31:12.854 --> 31:14.020
Very good.

31:14.039 --> 31:15.688
Actually I was wondering
if I could scrounge

31:15.708 --> 31:18.709
an invitation to the festive
feast, if you have room.

31:18.785 --> 31:21.603
Of course, you are more than
welcome to join us.

31:21.605 --> 31:24.047
Thank you,
that pasta the other day,

31:24.124 --> 31:26.608
it may mean that handsome
is as handsome does, but

31:26.610 --> 31:29.386
that handsome des very
well in the kitchen.

31:29.537 --> 31:32.464
[laughing]

31:32.616 --> 31:35.467
So you finally noticed, huh?

31:35.619 --> 31:37.543
Yeah, in the kitchen.

31:37.563 --> 31:40.564
Mrs. Myers, you
are terrible.

31:40.641 --> 31:42.974
Besides, I think he's
interested in Ariella,

31:43.127 --> 31:44.884
that caroler from Italy.

31:44.904 --> 31:46.570
They seem to have
a lot in common.

31:46.721 --> 31:47.738
Oh.

31:47.889 --> 31:50.148
And once Olivia
comes back, I'm gonna go

31:50.300 --> 31:51.983
back to the city.

31:52.136 --> 31:54.394
That's 23 for dinner.

31:54.413 --> 31:56.914
We invited the Serena Carolers
and Miles Croaker too,

31:56.990 --> 31:58.640
of course.

31:58.659 --> 32:01.143
Are you sure
that's a good idea?

32:01.145 --> 32:03.495
Yeah, one taste
of Stefano's mystery sauce

32:03.647 --> 32:06.148
and he is sure to
give a rave review.

32:06.166 --> 32:08.091
Miles Croaker has never
given any restaurant

32:08.243 --> 32:09.075
a rave review.

32:09.094 --> 32:10.335
Ever.

32:10.487 --> 32:11.503
Oh.

32:11.655 --> 32:13.171
The last restaurant
he banned, well--

32:13.323 --> 32:14.823
What?

32:14.825 --> 32:16.934
Closed within
a couple of months.

32:18.103 --> 32:20.662
[exhales]

32:20.664 --> 32:23.256
So what you're saying is
if we fail,

32:23.275 --> 32:25.609
we risk totally destroying
Olivia's dream.

32:27.004 --> 32:28.612
I'm afraid so.

32:35.788 --> 32:38.622
[sighs]

32:38.699 --> 32:41.774
Birds are out in full force.

32:41.794 --> 32:44.686
Really glad you agreed we
need to have a Christmas tree.

32:44.705 --> 32:46.538
Yeah, we have
Christmas tree in Italy,

32:46.690 --> 32:47.798
too, you know?

32:47.874 --> 32:49.374
I know.

32:49.526 --> 32:51.468
I saw the Pinterest.

32:51.619 --> 32:53.929
And this is it,
uh, this is our tree.

32:58.035 --> 32:59.142
I don't know.

32:59.294 --> 33:00.960
I do know.

33:00.980 --> 33:03.146
The correct height, uh,
the correct amount around.

33:04.541 --> 33:07.209
And the correct
amount of branches.

33:07.227 --> 33:09.561
There's a correct
number of branches?

33:09.713 --> 33:11.563
Yes.

33:11.715 --> 33:13.657
Not so many,
there's not enough space for

33:13.734 --> 33:16.451
decoration, but enough
space uh, to be like,

33:18.388 --> 33:19.221
[speaks Italian]

33:19.223 --> 33:21.147
to be

33:21.166 --> 33:23.225
Bushy.

33:23.243 --> 33:26.003
Natalie, it's a tree
not a bush.

33:30.400 --> 33:32.658
Just doesn't feel right.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.236
Feel?

33:34.238 --> 33:36.571
What does feel have
to do with this?

33:36.590 --> 33:39.332
It's all about logic like
life, uh cooking, like love.

33:39.351 --> 33:41.184
[laughs]

33:42.354 --> 33:44.187
Life is not about logic,
it's about

33:46.416 --> 33:48.841
oh, what about this one?

33:48.861 --> 33:51.695
Oh, why this one?

33:51.772 --> 33:54.680
I don't know, my
instincts just tell me,

33:54.700 --> 33:56.533
this is the right tree.

33:56.684 --> 33:59.444
Yeah, I think your instinct uh,
mistaken.

33:59.596 --> 34:00.612
My instincts
are never wrong.

34:00.764 --> 34:02.039
Huh?

34:04.101 --> 34:05.876
Is that right?

34:09.697 --> 34:11.197
Oh.

34:11.216 --> 34:13.291
Oh, hmm.

34:13.443 --> 34:14.626
Wait, did you
just say you think you can

34:14.778 --> 34:16.553
rely on logic for love?

34:16.704 --> 34:18.513
Of course.

34:20.300 --> 34:21.558
What else?

34:21.709 --> 34:23.060
Instincts.

34:23.211 --> 34:25.729
Intuition.

34:25.880 --> 34:27.956
That little voice inside
you that says you're at

34:27.974 --> 34:30.959
the perfect place
at the perfect time.

34:30.961 --> 34:33.695
And when that
has happened to you?

34:36.391 --> 34:38.316
Well, it hasn't happened.

34:38.468 --> 34:39.576
Not yet.

34:39.727 --> 34:41.244
But it will.

34:41.396 --> 34:43.080
[laughing]

34:43.156 --> 34:44.806
What, it's not like logic's
really worked out

34:44.825 --> 34:46.583
so well for you either.

34:55.594 --> 34:58.244
It's it's
hard to see under here.

34:58.263 --> 35:00.171
Um, well, let me
get some lights, maybe

35:00.324 --> 35:02.099
that'll help.

35:03.936 --> 35:05.009
[screaming]

35:05.162 --> 35:07.162
Um Tyler, Tyler!

35:07.180 --> 35:08.496
Oh Tyler, are you okay?

35:08.515 --> 35:10.165
Tyler, are you okay?

35:10.183 --> 35:11.924
Tyler, are you hurt?

35:11.944 --> 35:14.760
Are you all chopped up
like potato peelings?

35:14.780 --> 35:15.946
Are you hurt?

35:16.022 --> 35:17.839
Are you chopped up
like

35:17.858 --> 35:20.450
No, but I might be
deaf from here on out.

35:20.527 --> 35:22.510
If you heard me
ask the question,

35:22.529 --> 35:23.695
how can you be deaf?

35:23.847 --> 35:25.347
What was that?

35:25.365 --> 35:26.681
What was that
what was that ringing?

35:26.700 --> 35:28.516
Nevermind the ringing,
what about the plumbing?

35:28.535 --> 35:29.517
Huh, what?

35:29.519 --> 35:30.518
What?

35:30.520 --> 35:31.611
What drumming?

35:31.630 --> 35:33.355
Plumbing,
not drumming.

35:33.373 --> 35:36.374
Oh, right.

35:36.526 --> 35:39.118
Look, um, I'm sorry,
Beebee, I can't do this.

35:39.138 --> 35:41.621
Tell Ms. Natalie I tried
but I guess they're gonna

35:41.640 --> 35:43.473
have to cancel
the feast of Natale.

35:45.385 --> 35:46.868
I'm sorry, alright?

35:46.870 --> 35:49.871
Okay, hold on.

35:49.890 --> 35:52.131
You can't give up.

35:52.151 --> 35:54.818
Don't you see this is
a chance to prove

35:55.988 --> 35:57.470
your awesomeness.

35:57.489 --> 35:59.472
Awesomeness, I

35:59.491 --> 36:02.475
I don't even know if I have
any awesomeness.

36:02.494 --> 36:04.661
Well, here's your chance
to find out.

36:06.665 --> 36:09.407
It's time to prove your
awesomeness, Tyler.

36:09.559 --> 36:10.909
You can do this.

36:11.061 --> 36:12.502
Okay.

36:12.579 --> 36:13.670
Alright, you
stand over there.

36:13.821 --> 36:15.172
Okay!

36:15.248 --> 36:16.398
Why?

36:16.416 --> 36:17.749
Because if I do
find my awesomeness,

36:17.901 --> 36:19.083
I wanna make sure it doesn't
get shredded in the

36:19.236 --> 36:20.510
garbage disposal.

36:20.662 --> 36:22.570
[laughs]

36:22.572 --> 36:25.015
[Tyler grunts]

36:28.261 --> 36:29.352
-No!
-Yes!

36:31.748 --> 36:34.265
[grunts]

36:34.418 --> 36:35.609
-No.
-Yes.

36:38.179 --> 36:40.939
What if your intuition
never picks

36:41.091 --> 36:43.516
a logical tree?

36:43.535 --> 36:45.260
What if your logic never
picks a tree

36:45.278 --> 36:47.111
that feels right?

36:47.264 --> 36:48.622
What if intuition is broken?

36:50.617 --> 36:52.876
What if your logic
is just

36:54.028 --> 36:56.195
stupid?

36:56.215 --> 36:59.049
Have you thought about just
buying two trees?

36:59.200 --> 37:02.110
Then you can both
be right

37:02.128 --> 37:04.446
and happy.

37:04.464 --> 37:06.614
We do have room for it.

37:06.633 --> 37:09.284
I wanna have all day,
so yes, thank you.

37:09.286 --> 37:11.953
Okay, two trees it is.

37:11.972 --> 37:14.231
Just call it when you
see the one you want.

37:14.382 --> 37:16.958
-Okay, you too.
-Okay.

37:16.977 --> 37:17.809
[Stefano clicks tongue]

37:17.961 --> 37:19.811
-Mine!
-Mine!

37:19.963 --> 37:21.129
[both laugh]

37:21.147 --> 37:23.481
Natalie, hi, how are you?

37:23.633 --> 37:26.468
Hey, Olivia, um
how's the Roman snow-blow?

37:26.486 --> 37:28.803
Yeah, it's still blowing.

37:28.822 --> 37:30.580
Oh.

37:33.143 --> 37:34.826
Oh, what's wrong?

37:34.978 --> 37:37.587
Did your plan for Christmas
with your friends fall through?

37:37.739 --> 37:39.923
It uh, hasn't gone exactly

37:40.074 --> 37:41.816
according to plan.

37:41.835 --> 37:42.984
Um

37:43.003 --> 37:44.486
[speaking Italian]

37:44.504 --> 37:46.154
I actually kind of have
a strange question for you.

37:46.156 --> 37:47.338
Do you know where I could get

37:47.491 --> 37:50.100
a bottle of Olio d'oliva
descadoni.

37:50.176 --> 37:52.752
Well, that is a rare kind of
olive oil.

37:52.771 --> 37:55.272
You are not gonna
try to cook, are you?

37:55.348 --> 37:57.348
No.

37:57.501 --> 37:59.183
Um, I just thought it
would make a nice gift for

37:59.336 --> 38:02.003
um, for a friend.

38:02.022 --> 38:03.021
Oh, you know,
'cause it's from Parma,

38:03.173 --> 38:04.781
the same region as Chef
Grimaldi.

38:04.932 --> 38:07.933
Oh, I had no idea.

38:07.953 --> 38:10.011
Um, do you know where
I can find it in the State?

38:10.030 --> 38:12.289
[Olivia]
No, I do not know of any place
outside of Italy,

38:12.440 --> 38:13.515
I'm so sorry.

38:13.533 --> 38:15.125
Oh.

38:15.276 --> 38:16.351
Well, that's okay.

38:16.353 --> 38:18.536
Thanks anyway, Olivia.

38:18.688 --> 38:21.539
Um, I have to go.

38:21.691 --> 38:23.207
I miss you.

38:23.360 --> 38:24.208
Merry Christmas.

38:24.361 --> 38:25.527
I miss you, too.

38:25.529 --> 38:27.387
Merry Christmas.

38:29.716 --> 38:30.765
[car beeps]

38:32.719 --> 38:34.811
Perfect.

38:34.888 --> 38:35.870
Keys please.

38:35.889 --> 38:37.772
Thanks.

38:39.225 --> 38:41.318
[Tyler]
Let's have a go,
moment of truth.

38:57.485 --> 38:59.060
So much for my awesomeness.

38:59.079 --> 39:01.396
No, Tyler,
you've been great.

39:01.398 --> 39:04.232
You really have.

39:04.250 --> 39:07.068
I mean you know so much more
than you thought you did.

39:07.087 --> 39:09.829
You think?

39:09.848 --> 39:11.831
You've been great
too, Beebee.

39:11.850 --> 39:13.016
I never would've thought
about checking with the

39:13.093 --> 39:14.667
city about the main line.

39:14.686 --> 39:15.852
Thanks.

39:16.003 --> 39:18.170
But

39:18.190 --> 39:20.005
Yeah.

39:20.025 --> 39:22.250
So I guess I'll
I'll see you back at

39:22.268 --> 39:24.510
school in January.

39:24.529 --> 39:26.754
Yeah.

39:26.756 --> 39:29.699
January.

39:29.776 --> 39:31.659
Bye.

39:34.781 --> 39:36.856
Wait!

39:36.875 --> 39:38.666
Did we remember to turn
the sink's off valve back on?

39:40.286 --> 39:41.193
[claps hands]

39:41.213 --> 39:42.604
Yes, yes!

39:42.606 --> 39:44.772
Alright, okay.

39:44.774 --> 39:46.383
[Tyler grunts]

39:48.387 --> 39:49.611
[sighs]

39:49.629 --> 39:52.538
Alright, here we go.

39:52.557 --> 39:54.465
-Yes!
-Yes!

39:54.618 --> 39:56.709
Yes!

39:56.728 --> 39:58.812
Oh, yes!

40:02.475 --> 40:03.566
Just leave it there.

40:03.643 --> 40:06.569
[Stefano sighs]

40:06.721 --> 40:09.239
[Tyler and Beebee laughing]

40:09.390 --> 40:11.891
What is that?

40:11.910 --> 40:14.744
I think that's
the sound of awesomeness.

40:14.821 --> 40:17.321
Awesomeness?

40:17.474 --> 40:18.973
[Tyler]
Yes, oh yes!

40:18.992 --> 40:21.309
-Is that good?
-[Natalie] It's very good.

40:21.327 --> 40:23.828
[laughing]

40:23.980 --> 40:25.905
Is there a plumber
in the house?

40:25.924 --> 40:27.740
Oh, Ms. Natalie, Tyler got
the water back on.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.926
Yeah, and Beebee
helped, she was she was

40:30.003 --> 40:31.261
Awes
awesomeness.

40:31.337 --> 40:33.154
Well, yeah.

40:33.173 --> 40:35.156
Good, then we start
with the pasta.

40:35.175 --> 40:36.248
Sure, yeah, I'm ready
to do anything.

40:36.268 --> 40:37.583
No Tyler, you better go home
and shower

40:37.602 --> 40:39.177
not work
in the kitchen, huh?

40:39.329 --> 40:41.921
Oh yeah, well, I guess yeah,
I'm sort of

40:41.940 --> 40:42.939
Me too.

40:43.016 --> 40:44.757
Yeah, you've done enough
for now.

40:44.776 --> 40:47.444
Natalie will help
me with the pasta.

40:48.688 --> 40:50.930
Me?

40:50.949 --> 40:53.007
You do remember what
happened the last time

40:53.026 --> 40:54.025
I tried to cook, right?

40:54.177 --> 40:55.285
[laughs]

40:55.361 --> 40:58.196
Don't worry,
Natalie, you're not cooking.

40:58.348 --> 41:00.123
You're just making
the tortellinis.

41:00.274 --> 41:01.849
I'll be the one
cooking them.

41:01.851 --> 41:04.686
Oh, okay, great.

41:04.704 --> 41:06.612
In my country, Natalie,
the children do

41:06.631 --> 41:09.114
this all the time.

41:09.134 --> 41:10.191
I mean at least
a child, si.

41:10.210 --> 41:11.301
Si.

41:11.377 --> 41:12.860
I mean yes.

41:12.862 --> 41:15.221
Crack the egg into the flour.

41:18.368 --> 41:20.718
Whoops, too hard.

41:20.870 --> 41:22.537
-Uh, let me try
-Si.

41:22.555 --> 41:23.897
Si, si, si, si, si.

41:25.892 --> 41:26.966
Another one.

41:26.985 --> 41:29.777
Okay, let
me try that again.

41:35.068 --> 41:36.951
Bellissimo.

41:40.832 --> 41:42.223
Perfecto.

41:42.242 --> 41:44.751
Uh, now need to uh,

41:46.171 --> 41:48.913
beat the egg up like you making
scrambled eggs,

41:49.065 --> 41:51.899
but incorporating
the flour slowly.

41:51.918 --> 41:53.510
Like this.

41:55.013 --> 41:56.846
Oh, sure.

42:08.084 --> 42:10.009
You never made
scrambled eggs?

42:10.028 --> 42:12.862
Yes, I have not.

42:14.366 --> 42:15.848
How have you not
starved to death in that

42:15.867 --> 42:18.092
city of yours?

42:18.094 --> 42:19.619
Grabhub.

42:21.022 --> 42:22.872
The pizza delivery boy.

42:22.949 --> 42:25.433
Ai yai yai.

42:25.435 --> 42:28.360
You know, if everybody stayed
home and cooked every night,

42:28.380 --> 42:31.272
nobody would need to go
to a restaurant.

42:31.274 --> 42:33.216
The egg is getting away.

42:33.367 --> 42:36.277
Oh, ooh, hold on
eggies,

42:36.279 --> 42:38.037
get back here.

42:38.056 --> 42:40.798
Back to your volcano.

42:40.950 --> 42:43.117
Don't you wanna be part of
the best pasta

42:43.136 --> 42:45.395
the world's ever known.

42:47.290 --> 42:48.547
Good.

42:48.567 --> 42:50.792
Well, now the pasta
is mixed,

42:50.810 --> 42:52.310
we need to knead it.

42:52.462 --> 42:54.962
It's a very good workout,
my nonna,

42:54.981 --> 42:57.298
my grandmother, she had
arms like a

42:57.300 --> 42:59.075
like a Schwarzenegger.

42:59.152 --> 43:00.468
Oh.

43:00.486 --> 43:01.911
I'm not really sure
if that's a ringing

43:01.988 --> 43:03.413
endorsement or not.

43:26.420 --> 43:28.771
Ai, you have
to lean into it, uh.

43:32.927 --> 43:34.777
Oh.

43:37.782 --> 43:40.533
You need to feel it changing
under your hands.

43:52.797 --> 43:54.205
Feel it changing?

43:54.357 --> 43:56.707
[laughs]

43:56.860 --> 43:59.469
I feel something.

44:06.035 --> 44:08.478
[Ariella]
Buongiorno, anyone here?

44:08.629 --> 44:09.704
Here!

44:09.722 --> 44:11.205
Uh yeah,
we're over here.

44:11.207 --> 44:12.373
Ariella.

44:12.392 --> 44:13.799
Ciao bella.

44:13.818 --> 44:15.300
[kissing]

44:15.320 --> 44:18.470
[speaking Italian]

44:18.490 --> 44:21.658
The carolers and I just wanted
to drop off po di vino.

44:21.809 --> 44:23.142
Not not for
the feast of Natale

44:23.161 --> 44:24.977
of course, but uh,

44:24.996 --> 44:27.738
just an early grazie for
everything you are doing for us.

44:27.891 --> 44:28.906
Prego.

44:29.058 --> 44:30.667
Very thoughtful
of you, grazie.

44:30.743 --> 44:33.728
Yes, very, very thoughtful

44:33.746 --> 44:36.731
of all of the carolers.

44:36.749 --> 44:38.900
Please thank them for us.

44:38.918 --> 44:41.068
[speaking Italian]

44:41.070 --> 44:43.513
And uh, what's all this?

44:43.589 --> 44:45.573
Oh, you make pasta?

44:45.591 --> 44:48.267
I used to make pasta with
mia nonna every Natale.

44:49.354 --> 44:51.187
It uh, it was my
favorite part.

44:52.432 --> 44:55.266
But uh, I can help.

44:55.418 --> 44:57.176
Oh, you cook?

44:57.195 --> 44:59.987
Of course,
I love to cook.

45:01.366 --> 45:03.533
But you're our guest,
we couldn't possibly make you

45:04.777 --> 45:06.703
work in the kitchen.

45:06.779 --> 45:09.430
Make me, no, I want to.

45:09.449 --> 45:10.431
We'd love your help.

45:10.433 --> 45:11.432
Let me get you an apron.

45:11.434 --> 45:12.375
Andiamo.

45:12.526 --> 45:13.434
[Ariella]
Okay.

45:13.436 --> 45:15.937
Great.

45:15.955 --> 45:18.197
[blows raspberry]

45:18.216 --> 45:21.050
[speaking Italian]

45:58.664 --> 45:59.922
Hmm.

46:00.074 --> 46:01.424
[speaking Italian]

46:11.102 --> 46:13.019
[sighs]

46:23.097 --> 46:25.172
They're waiting for us.

46:25.174 --> 46:26.449
Okay, I'm ready.

46:28.511 --> 46:30.620
Um, Chef Stefano.

46:32.698 --> 46:35.625
How'd you come with your
logical list of

46:35.701 --> 46:37.852
qualities you're looking
for in a woman?

46:37.870 --> 46:40.521
Well, I thought about it
and she didn't make sense to me.

46:40.523 --> 46:42.356
Why what's the matter?

46:42.358 --> 46:44.859
Oh, nothing, nothing.

46:44.877 --> 46:46.219
I just I guess I just
haven't done enough thinking.

46:47.196 --> 46:49.380
Andiamo.

46:49.532 --> 46:52.308
Baked brie with olive tabouli,
minestrone reteta,

46:52.459 --> 46:54.702
ricotta and spinach
tortellini,

46:54.720 --> 46:57.038
braised beef in Merlot
wine sauce and something

46:57.056 --> 46:59.106
called, "Panettone".

47:00.985 --> 47:03.060
Sounds wonderful.

47:03.212 --> 47:06.138
But I'm afraid Stefano's
multo-italiano menu

47:06.157 --> 47:08.658
isn't gonna trigger any warm
American fuzzies.

47:09.977 --> 47:12.053
I make these
really good cookie bars.

47:12.071 --> 47:14.313
Well, it's a start.

47:14.332 --> 47:16.666
I know, we can make
a big batch of cookies

47:16.742 --> 47:18.150
and then take
the tray into the town

47:18.169 --> 47:20.061
Christmas Cookie
Swap this afternoon.

47:20.063 --> 47:22.338
Christmas Cookie Swap?

47:22.415 --> 47:23.840
This afternoon?

47:23.916 --> 47:26.734
Beebee, you just
baked my day.

47:26.752 --> 47:28.845
[laughing]

47:28.996 --> 47:30.179
Ooh, but we're gonna have
to hurry

47:30.256 --> 47:31.238
if we'll be ready
on time.

47:31.240 --> 47:32.139
Come on.

47:45.104 --> 47:47.446
Just like shake some in.

47:53.613 --> 47:54.595
Oh!

47:54.614 --> 47:56.497
[Beebee groaning]

48:04.290 --> 48:05.530
Okay.

48:05.550 --> 48:07.124
All over.

48:07.276 --> 48:08.968
Everywhere.

48:12.557 --> 48:13.389
Oh, looks pretty great.

48:13.540 --> 48:14.615
Perfect.

48:14.634 --> 48:16.467
Good job.

48:16.619 --> 48:17.852
[Natalie]
Alright, to the fridge.

48:22.400 --> 48:24.291
Now we just 30 minutes
while it sets.

48:24.310 --> 48:26.569
You better set a timer,
can't rely on a smoke alarm

48:26.720 --> 48:29.906
for this one.

48:37.807 --> 48:40.658
So I ordered all the place cards
and the menu cards,

48:40.810 --> 48:42.919
I know you wanted to write
them up by hand

48:43.070 --> 48:45.755
but until Chef Stefano
finalizes the menu

48:48.927 --> 48:49.926
Ms. Natalie.

48:50.077 --> 48:52.595
It's like
Olio d'oliva descadoni

48:52.672 --> 48:54.513
is some kind of--

48:56.008 --> 48:57.158
Ms. Natalie!

48:57.176 --> 48:58.492
Culinary food myth,

48:58.511 --> 49:01.162
like free-range foie gras

49:01.164 --> 49:02.104
or guilt-free ice cream.

49:02.181 --> 49:03.330
Ms. Natalie!

49:03.349 --> 49:04.999
Oh, I'm sorry, what?

49:05.017 --> 49:06.025
It's time.

49:09.930 --> 49:12.073
Hurry, we're gonna
be late for the swap.

49:19.606 --> 49:21.015
Okay, go, go, go!

49:21.017 --> 49:22.208
[Natalie]
Hats, coats, gloves,
it's cold!

49:27.373 --> 49:29.614
The secret to a clean
kitchen is simple,

49:29.634 --> 49:30.967
don't cook ever.

49:40.386 --> 49:41.885
Porca vacca!

49:42.038 --> 49:43.037
[Tyler]
What, what, oh sorry,
what happened?

49:43.039 --> 49:43.980
What?

49:44.056 --> 49:46.874
I can't see.

49:46.892 --> 49:48.133
[Tyler]
Holy cow!

49:48.152 --> 49:51.045
That's what I said,
eh, not exactly,

49:51.047 --> 49:52.546
but you get the idea.

49:52.548 --> 49:54.323
What happened?

49:54.400 --> 49:55.825
There's only one
thing I can think of that

49:55.976 --> 49:57.885
can cause so much damage
to a kitchen

49:57.887 --> 49:58.977
in so short of a time.

49:58.997 --> 50:00.888
Rabid badgers?

50:00.906 --> 50:02.999
Rabid badgers, Natalie!

50:03.150 --> 50:05.501
Oh yeah.

50:05.652 --> 50:07.652
Yeah, that make
that makes sense.

50:07.672 --> 50:08.896
Well, look look at least
the smoke alarm isn't

50:08.898 --> 50:10.914
going off yet.

50:11.067 --> 50:12.733
This feast of Natale is not
gonna work.

50:12.752 --> 50:13.901
Why do you say that?

50:13.919 --> 50:16.495
Because we used
up our Christmas miracle

50:16.514 --> 50:19.181
when Natalie didn't burn
the whole place down.

50:20.334 --> 50:21.183
[sighs]

50:24.096 --> 50:26.247
Okay, are we late,
did we make it on time?

50:26.265 --> 50:28.190
Uh no, we made it.

50:28.342 --> 50:29.525
Wooh.

50:29.676 --> 50:32.361
[indistinct chatter
and laughter]

50:36.275 --> 50:37.591
There's free samples.

50:37.593 --> 50:38.759
Don't say it.

50:38.778 --> 50:41.520
That's because you're one
smart cookie.

50:41.539 --> 50:42.538
[grunts]

50:48.454 --> 50:50.695
[Natalie]
Big beautiful bars, thank you.

50:50.715 --> 50:52.773
Thank you.

50:52.792 --> 50:54.775
Ooh, maybe we
should do two, alright?

50:54.794 --> 50:55.885
Thank you.

50:55.961 --> 50:57.461
Hmm, yummy.

50:57.538 --> 50:59.280
They almost look like a little
reindeer poop or something.

50:59.282 --> 51:00.556
[laughs]

51:00.633 --> 51:01.782
-It it has to be.
-They're really good.

51:01.784 --> 51:03.617
Yeah.

51:03.636 --> 51:04.785
Gingerbread cookie.

51:04.804 --> 51:05.710
Thank you.

51:05.730 --> 51:07.521
Merry Christmas.

51:13.145 --> 51:15.053
Beebee, did we forget
to turn the oven off

51:15.073 --> 51:16.463
or something?

51:16.465 --> 51:19.316
We never turned it on.

51:19.468 --> 51:21.560
Oh, but maybe we
forgot to tidy up.

51:21.579 --> 51:23.061
I didn't forget,
we really didn't have time.

51:23.081 --> 51:24.305
Natalie, what is that?
What is this?

51:24.323 --> 51:25.973
This cooking, huh?

51:25.975 --> 51:26.974
What is this?

51:26.992 --> 51:29.251
Hmm?

51:29.403 --> 51:32.088
I'm sorry,
I think we may have left

51:32.239 --> 51:34.924
the kitchen a little
not clean.

51:36.335 --> 51:37.593
Not clean.

51:37.670 --> 51:40.654
I come inside and I take
a look and I say

51:40.673 --> 51:42.914
what'd I say-- What I--

51:42.934 --> 51:44.992
[speaks Italian]

51:44.994 --> 51:47.853
[speaks Italian]

51:50.850 --> 51:53.834
Oh, grande like grand,
a big a big mess.

51:53.853 --> 51:55.836
Uh yeah,
it's a big mess.

51:55.855 --> 51:57.855
We have only one day left,
so much to do

51:58.007 --> 52:00.116
and you run off
for this.

52:00.192 --> 52:02.952
Uh, why don't you take
my half

52:03.028 --> 52:05.696
and head back to the restaurant
and get started on the clean-up.

52:05.848 --> 52:06.847
Hmm.

52:06.849 --> 52:07.514
Explain to me.

52:07.516 --> 52:09.107
Yeah, I'll help.

52:09.127 --> 52:11.109
Oh, you don't have to do that,
it wasn't your mess.

52:11.129 --> 52:13.354
No, no,
I wanna help.

52:13.372 --> 52:15.131
You do?

52:15.207 --> 52:17.466
Yeah, Chef Stefano scares me
when he's like this.

52:17.618 --> 52:19.451
I don't even know what these
cookies are?

52:19.470 --> 52:22.471
Oh look, these are shortbreads

52:22.548 --> 52:25.457
with a little um,
icing drizzl,

52:25.476 --> 52:28.310
and this little gingerbread man.

52:29.630 --> 52:31.705
Little gingerbread man,

52:31.724 --> 52:33.056
"Can't catch me,
I'm a gingerbread man."

52:33.209 --> 52:34.224
No, no,
no, no, no, no.

52:34.377 --> 52:36.226
No, no, Natalie.

52:36.379 --> 52:38.988
This is an Italian feast
of Natale,

52:39.064 --> 52:41.899
not the American
feast of cookie.

52:42.051 --> 52:43.717
-Capito?
-Mhmm.

52:43.736 --> 52:45.494
We will do panettone

52:45.646 --> 52:48.330
made by my family recipe,
capisce?

52:50.001 --> 52:51.667
-And the cookies.
-Mamma mia.

52:51.818 --> 52:53.836
[Natalie]
I read on Miles' reviews,
I think he would really like

52:53.913 --> 52:55.078
[Miles]
Uh, Natalie.

52:55.231 --> 52:56.230
Stefano.

52:56.248 --> 52:58.340
Speak of the devil.

52:58.492 --> 52:59.583
Hello.

52:59.735 --> 53:01.326
-Ariella, ciao.
-Ciao, Stefano.

53:01.345 --> 53:02.403
[kissing]

53:02.421 --> 53:03.420
Mr. Croaker.

53:03.572 --> 53:04.496
-Natalie, ciao.
-Hello.

53:04.515 --> 53:07.165
[kissing]

53:07.185 --> 53:10.001
Well, everybody is so excited
and looking forward

53:10.021 --> 53:11.595
to your feast of Natale.

53:11.747 --> 53:12.913
[laughs]

53:12.932 --> 53:14.190
So are we.

53:14.266 --> 53:15.524
We uh, we're just gonna
head back there and get

53:15.676 --> 53:16.859
some things ready.

53:17.010 --> 53:19.195
We want it all to
be just perfect.

53:19.271 --> 53:21.088
That means you're coming to
the Christmas festival,

53:21.106 --> 53:22.423
it's about to start.

53:22.441 --> 53:24.258
Oh, no, no,
there is so much to do.

53:24.276 --> 53:25.517
-Sorry, yeah.
-[Natalie] So much to do.

53:25.536 --> 53:27.018
More than ever.

53:27.038 --> 53:29.020
But it's our first
annual Christmas festival,

53:29.040 --> 53:30.355
you must come.

53:30.374 --> 53:32.766
We need everyone to
make it a success.

53:32.768 --> 53:35.769
I organized it myself.

53:35.771 --> 53:37.028
If you insist.

53:37.048 --> 53:39.531
We'll be there with bells on.

53:39.550 --> 53:41.383
-Like jingle bells.
-[Stefano] Oh.

53:41.460 --> 53:43.886
Um, cool uh,

53:44.037 --> 53:45.554
we'll just go get ready now.

53:45.706 --> 53:46.722
-See you soon.
-Do that.

53:46.873 --> 53:48.891
See you soon.

53:55.307 --> 53:58.150
[indistinct chatter]

54:06.911 --> 54:09.486
Alright, alright,
this way.

54:09.638 --> 54:10.579
Get on there.

54:14.326 --> 54:15.309
Okay, you there.

54:15.327 --> 54:17.311
[laughing]

54:17.329 --> 54:18.236
Okay, ready.

54:18.256 --> 54:19.421
Cheese.

54:24.095 --> 54:25.652
-[Tyler] Yes!
-[Stall holder] Congratulations!

54:25.671 --> 54:28.079
Thank you.

54:28.099 --> 54:29.990
Here.

54:30.009 --> 54:31.433
Thank you.

54:36.015 --> 54:37.273
[Miles]
Oh, you're here!

54:37.424 --> 54:38.499
[laughs]

54:38.501 --> 54:39.833
I have just the thing.

54:39.852 --> 54:41.610
Right this way.

54:41.687 --> 54:44.446
Oh uh, but first, picture.

54:46.600 --> 54:48.342
Right, right, here we go!

54:48.344 --> 54:49.860
Here we go, have to
keep the line moving.

54:50.012 --> 54:52.538
[laughs]

54:56.627 --> 54:58.109
Sit down, Sparky.

54:58.129 --> 54:59.753
Sit down.

55:06.712 --> 55:08.045
This one looks fun.

55:08.197 --> 55:09.972
Oh yeah, sure.

55:12.292 --> 55:14.125
Thanks.

55:14.145 --> 55:15.218
Go first.

55:15.371 --> 55:17.871
Sure, yeah.

55:17.890 --> 55:20.374
Okay, wooh.

55:20.392 --> 55:21.466
Aw.

55:21.485 --> 55:23.402
No good, here
let me try.

55:29.068 --> 55:30.617
It's okay.

55:36.000 --> 55:37.649
Do you feel okay?

55:37.668 --> 55:40.169
Yeah.

55:40.245 --> 55:42.654
How do I look
like I'm feeling?

55:42.673 --> 55:45.341
Well, I don't know,
but but nothing good.

55:52.925 --> 55:55.768
[taking deep breaths]

55:58.764 --> 56:01.690
So uh, have you seen

56:01.767 --> 56:04.526
any good Kung fu
movies lately?

56:05.863 --> 56:07.863
Mm, nope.

56:08.014 --> 56:09.923
Why?

56:09.925 --> 56:11.700
Uh, just just curious.

56:15.948 --> 56:18.265
What about baseball games?

56:18.283 --> 56:19.783
In December?

56:19.935 --> 56:21.118
Well, at least you know they
don't play baseball

56:21.270 --> 56:22.211
in the winter.

56:22.362 --> 56:24.880
Yeah, well,
that's all I know, so

56:29.962 --> 56:32.221
Yeah, I forgot to
ask uh, about what you do

56:32.297 --> 56:33.463
in the city?

56:33.616 --> 56:34.723
What is your job?

56:34.800 --> 56:37.017
Oh, I'm a Jacklyn
of all trades.

56:39.138 --> 56:41.897
I watch the dogs

56:41.974 --> 56:43.232
and design custom prints,

56:43.383 --> 56:46.568
do specialty gift-wrapping,
plan events and parties,

56:46.720 --> 56:49.071
and about a hundred other
things.

56:49.222 --> 56:50.406
Huh, why do you
do so many things?

56:50.557 --> 56:52.825
Why don't you
just do one thing?

56:54.227 --> 56:56.227
I don't know,
I guess I just never found

56:56.247 --> 56:59.081
the right thing and so
I kept trying new things.

56:59.232 --> 57:01.975
Hmm, when I was 3 years old

57:01.994 --> 57:04.670
my Zio Lorenzo,
he put a knife in my hand

57:05.998 --> 57:08.072
and I knew I would be a chef.

57:08.092 --> 57:10.259
That is all I ever
wanna be.

57:10.335 --> 57:13.170
Your Zio Lorenzo
gave a butcher's knife to

57:13.322 --> 57:14.504
a 3-year-old?

57:14.657 --> 57:16.748
No.

57:16.767 --> 57:19.268
Maybe I exaggerate
a little bit, huh?

57:19.419 --> 57:21.395
Well, maybe
you're exaggerating now.

57:23.757 --> 57:26.275
Maybe you're afraid, huh?

57:27.519 --> 57:29.736
I'm not scared of anything.

57:32.858 --> 57:34.533
Except perhaps the cold, yes?

57:37.196 --> 57:38.770
It's not that bad.

57:38.789 --> 57:40.622
No, you're cold.

58:13.899 --> 58:15.232
What's that?

58:15.384 --> 58:16.399
What's what?

58:16.552 --> 58:18.660
The piece of paper
you keep checking.

58:18.812 --> 58:21.722
What, what piece of paper?

58:21.740 --> 58:24.166
The one in your pocket.

58:24.243 --> 58:26.818
Um

58:26.837 --> 58:27.744
Catch!

58:27.896 --> 58:28.912
No!

58:29.064 --> 58:29.821
Beebee, Beebee,
no, no, no, no.

58:29.840 --> 58:31.398
Don't, don't.

58:31.400 --> 58:32.841
Oh, what is it,
a letter to Santa?

58:32.993 --> 58:34.401
[Tyler]
Don't just don't just don't
just don't just

58:34.419 --> 58:36.570
can can you give it back
to me please, Beebee?

58:36.572 --> 58:39.348
[indistinct chatter in
background]

58:50.753 --> 58:53.695
What is this?

58:53.772 --> 58:56.490
"My smile, awesomeness,
likes baseball."

59:00.371 --> 59:02.020
What is this, like a list
of things I'm supposed to be

59:02.039 --> 59:03.539
or something?

59:03.690 --> 59:06.433
No, it's--

59:06.435 --> 59:08.285
I'm not hardly
any of these things.

59:08.437 --> 59:10.045
Beebee, it's not
like that, it's just--

59:13.959 --> 59:14.958
I was just
trying to be logical,

59:15.110 --> 59:17.886
that's all.

59:18.038 --> 59:19.946
You're a jerk.

59:19.965 --> 59:21.848
Beebee.

59:23.227 --> 59:24.560
Beebee.

59:37.816 --> 59:39.241
Beebee,
what's the matter?

59:39.392 --> 59:40.242
What happened?

59:40.393 --> 59:41.410
Are you okay?

59:41.486 --> 59:43.637
It's Tyler, he's being
really logical.

59:43.655 --> 59:45.080
I can't

59:45.231 --> 59:47.916
Okay, let's go have some cocoa,
you can tell me about it.

59:49.402 --> 59:51.253
Grazie.

1:00:01.840 --> 1:00:04.825
Why don't you
start at the beginning?

1:00:04.827 --> 1:00:07.844
We were at the Santa
sling booth and I was

1:00:07.996 --> 1:00:09.730
I was trying to figure out
how Tyler felt about me.

1:00:11.442 --> 1:00:13.850
He started asking all
these stupid questions

1:00:14.002 --> 1:00:16.519
about Kung fu, baseball,
checking

1:00:16.672 --> 1:00:17.762
his stupid list.

1:00:17.781 --> 1:00:20.115
[sighs]

1:00:21.693 --> 1:00:24.027
[Beebee]
He said he was just trying
to be logical.

1:00:24.179 --> 1:00:26.771
But then he can't possibly
like me,

1:00:26.790 --> 1:00:28.957
I don't like any of the things
on the stupid list,

1:00:30.869 --> 1:00:33.795
especially

1:00:33.947 --> 1:00:35.372
not the nice
smile part.

1:00:35.524 --> 1:00:37.132
Oh.

1:00:37.209 --> 1:00:40.135
Beebee, hey.

1:00:40.286 --> 1:00:42.529
Your smile is lovely

1:00:42.547 --> 1:00:45.289
just how it is, I promise.

1:00:45.309 --> 1:00:47.768
What could give Tyler such
a silly idea like this?

1:00:50.205 --> 1:00:52.648
"Speaks Italian,

1:00:52.799 --> 1:00:54.983
lives at the same place,
loves to cook."

1:00:58.656 --> 1:01:00.380
You okay?

1:01:00.382 --> 1:01:01.715
Yeah.

1:01:01.717 --> 1:01:04.451
Of course, um,
what happened next?

1:01:06.405 --> 1:01:08.388
Well, I decided my intuition
was telling me

1:01:08.407 --> 1:01:10.666
Tyler is a jerk
and I left.

1:01:14.838 --> 1:01:17.673
But maybe you should
just sleep on it, yeah?

1:01:19.176 --> 1:01:21.084
Give your intuition some
time to think it over.

1:01:21.236 --> 1:01:23.253
Yeah, I think I'll do that.

1:01:23.405 --> 1:01:25.347
Christmas is exhausting.

1:01:28.852 --> 1:01:31.687
[sighs]

1:01:33.916 --> 1:01:35.857
Everything okay?

1:01:36.009 --> 1:01:38.768
You know, I think I'm just gonna
go back to the restaurant.

1:01:38.921 --> 1:01:41.029
But the festival
is important.

1:01:43.108 --> 1:01:44.774
[speaking Italian]

1:01:44.927 --> 1:01:46.609
Si.

1:01:46.762 --> 1:01:49.520
And Natalie is here,
too.

1:01:49.540 --> 1:01:51.614
But we were thinking uh,
we're gonna go back,

1:01:51.767 --> 1:01:52.782
it's there's so much to do.

1:01:52.935 --> 1:01:54.209
Oh no, you don't have to go,
too.

1:01:54.286 --> 1:01:57.270
You can stay,
I'm sure you want to.

1:01:57.272 --> 1:01:58.621
What, and let
you do all the work?

1:01:58.774 --> 1:01:59.956
No.

1:02:00.108 --> 1:02:01.717
What if you try to cook
and burn the entire place

1:02:01.868 --> 1:02:03.701
down to the ground?

1:02:03.721 --> 1:02:06.388
[laughs]

1:02:06.465 --> 1:02:07.630
[speaking Italian]

1:02:07.783 --> 1:02:09.207
It is time to sing.

1:02:09.226 --> 1:02:11.017
You must come,
you need to with me.

1:02:23.056 --> 1:02:24.814
Ooh, Sparky.

1:02:24.967 --> 1:02:26.316
Sorry.

1:02:26.468 --> 1:02:28.744
Sorry, Sparky.

1:02:32.324 --> 1:02:33.248
[speaking Italian]

1:02:33.325 --> 1:02:35.250
Grazie.

1:02:42.926 --> 1:02:47.837
¶ Angels we have
heard on high Sweetly ¶

1:02:47.990 --> 1:02:51.099
¶ singing o'er the plains ¶

1:02:51.176 --> 1:02:59.015
¶ And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains ¶

1:02:59.167 --> 1:03:12.195
¶ Gloria In excelsis Deo ¶

1:03:12.347 --> 1:03:26.760
¶ Gloria In excelsis Deo ¶

1:03:29.548 --> 1:03:31.306
[Stefano]
Natalie!

1:03:31.457 --> 1:03:32.382
Where are you going?

1:03:32.534 --> 1:03:33.550
Home.

1:03:33.702 --> 1:03:35.310
Home.

1:03:35.461 --> 1:03:37.979
The festival just started,
uh, you don't like it.

1:03:40.225 --> 1:03:42.042
Look, can I ask you
something?

1:03:42.060 --> 1:03:43.485
Yes.

1:03:43.562 --> 1:03:46.062
Can we just keep
things strictly business

1:03:46.214 --> 1:03:47.155
between the two of us?

1:03:47.307 --> 1:03:50.325
Strictly business?

1:03:50.476 --> 1:03:53.236
I know something is
wrong, I can tell.

1:03:53.388 --> 1:03:55.555
And it is a word for it uh,

1:03:55.574 --> 1:03:57.481
a word that is not a word.

1:03:57.501 --> 1:03:59.292
Uh, you are eh.

1:04:00.987 --> 1:04:03.171
A fork?

1:04:03.248 --> 1:04:04.914
Hangry.

1:04:05.067 --> 1:04:07.734
You need to eat and Sparky,
too.

1:04:07.752 --> 1:04:09.344
Let's go to Pezzo Di Parma,
I will cook

1:04:09.421 --> 1:04:10.995
for the both of you,
let's go.

1:04:11.014 --> 1:04:13.473
Listen, I said I just wanna keep
things strictly business.

1:04:14.518 --> 1:04:16.092
What how?

1:04:16.244 --> 1:04:18.520
How strictly business?

1:04:18.597 --> 1:04:21.247
Business is food,
food is business for me.

1:04:21.266 --> 1:04:23.692
How is it not
strictly business?

1:04:23.843 --> 1:04:25.343
The thing is I don't know
if we're really

1:04:25.362 --> 1:04:27.770
ready to be a business.

1:04:27.923 --> 1:04:29.865
I mean I don't know
if we're really ready to do

1:04:29.941 --> 1:04:32.367
a big feast of Natale,
not for this many people

1:04:33.778 --> 1:04:35.537
and not for Miles who's never
given a rave restaurant

1:04:35.688 --> 1:04:36.705
review in his entire life.

1:04:36.856 --> 1:04:39.374
He hasn't, not ever?

1:04:39.525 --> 1:04:40.783
No.

1:04:40.936 --> 1:04:42.878
And I read all of them

1:04:43.029 --> 1:04:45.863
and worse,

1:04:45.883 --> 1:04:48.049
every place he pens,
it shuts down.

1:04:48.126 --> 1:04:49.459
Natalie, I put
every bit of money

1:04:49.611 --> 1:04:51.553
I have in Pezzo Di Parma.

1:04:51.704 --> 1:04:52.721
I didn't know that.

1:04:52.797 --> 1:04:55.724
And if we close, Natalie,
it's worse uh,

1:04:55.800 --> 1:04:58.059
I cannot stay in America,
I have to go back to Italy.

1:04:59.304 --> 1:05:02.230
See, we uh
we can't do this to you.

1:05:02.307 --> 1:05:04.215
Or to cousin Olivia,
we can't ruin your dreams

1:05:04.234 --> 1:05:05.625
before they've even begun.

1:05:05.644 --> 1:05:07.736
Now you think my food is not
good enough, huh?

1:05:07.812 --> 1:05:09.479
That's not what I'm saying,
I just we don't have

1:05:09.631 --> 1:05:10.739
the time or the people

1:05:10.890 --> 1:05:12.482
And this is why you don't
want to come to eat now?

1:05:12.634 --> 1:05:13.909
It's not about that,
I just don't

1:05:13.985 --> 1:05:15.243
-Natalie.
-What?

1:05:15.320 --> 1:05:17.654
If my food is
not good enough for you,

1:05:17.806 --> 1:05:20.306
certo is not good
enough for anybody.

1:05:20.308 --> 1:05:21.565
Anybody.

1:05:21.585 --> 1:05:23.734
The feast of Natale,
Natalie, is off.

1:05:23.754 --> 1:05:25.311
Fine.

1:05:25.313 --> 1:05:26.312
[grunts]

1:05:26.314 --> 1:05:28.648
Fine!

1:05:28.650 --> 1:05:30.333
Fine!

1:05:30.485 --> 1:05:32.260
-It's off!
-[Stefano] Okay.

1:05:32.412 --> 1:05:35.338
God, stupid Stefano.

1:05:35.490 --> 1:05:37.157
Come on, Sparky.

1:05:37.159 --> 1:05:39.175
Come.

1:05:39.327 --> 1:05:41.102
[Natalie sighs]

1:05:50.005 --> 1:05:52.781
Panettone, panettone.

1:05:52.932 --> 1:05:55.116
I'll make panettone,
it'll make me feel better.

1:06:25.056 --> 1:06:27.557
[Natalie]
It's okay, it's okay.

1:06:27.709 --> 1:06:30.226
It's okay, it's okay,
come on.

1:06:30.378 --> 1:06:32.153
This way, this way.

1:06:37.235 --> 1:06:39.995
[carolers singing Christmas
carol in distance]

1:06:54.236 --> 1:06:56.011
Ooh, Natalie.

1:06:56.162 --> 1:06:57.345
What are you doing here?

1:06:57.422 --> 1:06:59.255
Uh, Mr. Croaker,
there is something I need

1:06:59.407 --> 1:07:01.349
to tell you and um,

1:07:03.186 --> 1:07:05.002
I thought I should probably
say it in person.

1:07:05.022 --> 1:07:07.263
[sighs]

1:07:07.415 --> 1:07:09.599
I'm very sorry.

1:07:09.751 --> 1:07:11.175
And please don't hold this
against my cousin Olivia

1:07:11.194 --> 1:07:14.029
or Stefano, but

1:07:17.759 --> 1:07:20.760
Um

1:07:20.779 --> 1:07:22.537
Uh, what's wrong?

1:07:25.024 --> 1:07:25.948
Has something happened?

1:07:26.101 --> 1:07:27.450
Stefano, you didn't have
to come,

1:07:27.602 --> 1:07:28.951
I can take care
of this myself.

1:07:29.104 --> 1:07:31.104
This is not only

1:07:31.122 --> 1:07:32.714
your cousin Olivia
restaurant,

1:07:32.865 --> 1:07:34.340
it it's also mine.

1:07:37.036 --> 1:07:38.961
Has someone had bad news?

1:07:39.114 --> 1:07:41.723
Oh, oh no, nothing
like that, they're just

1:07:43.209 --> 1:07:44.467
missing their friends
and family because

1:07:44.619 --> 1:07:46.227
it's Christmas.

1:07:46.304 --> 1:07:48.730
I thought singing might
cheer them up,

1:07:48.807 --> 1:07:51.232
but uh,
it's made things worse.

1:07:52.627 --> 1:07:55.070
Cassie has never spent
a Christmas away from her

1:07:55.221 --> 1:07:57.739
children before.

1:07:57.890 --> 1:08:00.149
Oh, and this was supposed
to be Charlie's first Christmas

1:08:00.302 --> 1:08:02.077
with his new fiancé.

1:08:02.228 --> 1:08:04.913
Oh no, that's so sad.

1:08:05.064 --> 1:08:07.248
[Miles]
There'll be other Christmases,
but right now

1:08:08.660 --> 1:08:11.252
it's hard for them all
to be far away from home.

1:08:12.831 --> 1:08:14.738
But everyone is looking
forward

1:08:14.758 --> 1:08:16.907
to your Christmas
meal tomorrow.

1:08:16.927 --> 1:08:18.259
[laughs]

1:08:18.336 --> 1:08:21.321
Now what is it you wanted
to tell me?

1:08:21.323 --> 1:08:23.264
Could you excuse
us just one minute?

1:08:25.084 --> 1:08:26.676
I feel terrible.

1:08:26.828 --> 1:08:27.936
I feel terrible.

1:08:28.087 --> 1:08:29.829
Yeah, me too.

1:08:29.848 --> 1:08:31.439
I wanted to do everything
my own way,

1:08:31.516 --> 1:08:34.000
just the right review,
but now look at this.

1:08:34.018 --> 1:08:35.610
I wanted to show
Olivia how much her help

1:08:35.761 --> 1:08:37.779
and support meant to me
and I guess I thought

1:08:37.930 --> 1:08:39.614
I could only do that
if everything was perfect.

1:08:39.691 --> 1:08:41.023
[sighs]

1:08:41.176 --> 1:08:43.025
I think I kind of lost seeing
that's it's Christmas.

1:08:43.178 --> 1:08:44.527
Yeah, yeah,
it's Christmas.

1:08:44.679 --> 1:08:46.362
[speaks Italian]

1:08:46.514 --> 1:08:47.864
And the kitchen.

1:08:48.016 --> 1:08:50.867
Yes, in there, too.

1:08:51.019 --> 1:08:53.110
What if we just
go through with it?

1:08:53.130 --> 1:08:55.204
What if we don't worry
about if it's perfect or

1:08:55.357 --> 1:08:58.024
what the review says, what
if we just do it to feed

1:08:58.026 --> 1:09:00.042
a bunch of sad people that
have nowhere else

1:09:00.195 --> 1:09:01.970
to go on Christmas?

1:09:02.046 --> 1:09:04.380
Yes, yes.

1:09:04.532 --> 1:09:06.307
Let's do it for
the people.

1:09:06.384 --> 1:09:09.144
And we need to be happy,
it's Christmas.

1:09:09.220 --> 1:09:10.386
-Okay?
-Okay.

1:09:10.538 --> 1:09:11.980
Let's do it.

1:09:13.817 --> 1:09:15.150
[sighs]

1:09:15.301 --> 1:09:17.727
Natalie, Stefano, uh

1:09:17.879 --> 1:09:20.321
you had something
to tell us?

1:09:20.398 --> 1:09:22.991
Yeah, just that the feast of
Natale is at 1:00

1:09:24.310 --> 1:09:25.827
and to bring your appetites.

1:09:25.978 --> 1:09:28.830
[Miles laughing]

1:09:28.981 --> 1:09:31.124
It's gonna be awesomeness.

1:09:34.838 --> 1:09:37.655

1:10:09.706 --> 1:10:12.874

Hello, Natalie Rogers,
travel consult

1:11:20.518 --> 1:11:22.777
oh um, events planning,

1:11:22.928 --> 1:11:25.095
um actually Jacklyn
of all trades,

1:11:25.115 --> 1:11:27.949
just uh tell
me which one you want.

1:11:28.100 --> 1:11:30.510
The Olio d'oliva descadoni?

1:11:30.512 --> 1:11:31.619
Yeah.

1:11:31.771 --> 1:11:34.455
I've been looking
for it everywhere.

1:11:36.534 --> 1:11:38.851
Back-ordered?

1:11:38.870 --> 1:11:41.612
Until when?

1:11:41.631 --> 1:11:42.855
July.

1:11:42.874 --> 1:11:44.716
Oh um, oh.

1:11:49.380 --> 1:11:52.140
[Natalie]
Okay, thanks anyways.

1:11:53.643 --> 1:11:55.201
You wanna tell me
what's got you so despondent

1:11:55.219 --> 1:11:56.627
over this olive oil?

1:11:56.646 --> 1:11:57.979
Olivia!

1:11:58.056 --> 1:11:59.814
-Hi.
-Hi.

1:11:59.891 --> 1:12:01.040
Oh, but how?

1:12:01.059 --> 1:12:02.875
Oh, they finally
dug Rome out from under

1:12:02.894 --> 1:12:04.727
that avalanche, I got the
first flight I could.

1:12:04.879 --> 1:12:06.546
Why are you here?

1:12:06.564 --> 1:12:07.730
I thought you were spending
Christmas with your friends

1:12:07.882 --> 1:12:08.656
in the city.

1:12:08.808 --> 1:12:11.400
I was, but I don't know
I know

1:12:11.553 --> 1:12:13.903
how hard you worked and how much
this means to you,

1:12:14.055 --> 1:12:15.888
so I just--

1:12:15.890 --> 1:12:17.390
Oh, it's so beautiful.

1:12:17.408 --> 1:12:18.407
Thank you.

1:12:18.560 --> 1:12:19.559
But why?

1:12:19.561 --> 1:12:21.502
It's a long, long story.

1:12:21.654 --> 1:12:23.229
Oh.

1:12:23.247 --> 1:12:24.672
Is it now?

1:12:24.749 --> 1:12:26.415
Well, that's good,
'cause I am a long,

1:12:26.568 --> 1:12:27.991
long listener.

1:12:28.011 --> 1:12:29.068
[laughs]

1:12:29.087 --> 1:12:31.161
Well, even after--

1:12:31.181 --> 1:12:32.347
[exhales]

1:12:32.423 --> 1:12:33.923
22 phone calls,

1:12:34.075 --> 1:12:37.000
and a dozen international
emails,

1:12:37.020 --> 1:12:38.770
and millions of hours scouring
the internet,

1:12:40.431 --> 1:12:43.191
I still couldn't find the Olio
d'oliva descadoni,

1:12:43.267 --> 1:12:45.676
so Stefano could have his

1:12:45.695 --> 1:12:47.920
perfect Christmas.

1:12:47.939 --> 1:12:50.256
Do you like Stefano?

1:12:50.274 --> 1:12:52.200
No!

1:12:52.351 --> 1:12:54.594
I mean I like him.

1:12:54.596 --> 1:12:57.020
I don't like-like him.

1:12:57.040 --> 1:12:59.281
He's kinda grumpy
sometimes.

1:12:59.434 --> 1:13:00.433
Oh.

1:13:00.435 --> 1:13:02.268
So you don't like him?

1:13:02.270 --> 1:13:03.603
[laughs]

1:13:03.605 --> 1:13:06.029
Even if I did,

1:13:06.049 --> 1:13:08.107
I have to go
back to the city.

1:13:08.126 --> 1:13:10.443
I have a life there and
I don't know,

1:13:10.461 --> 1:13:12.870
I can't stay here.

1:13:12.889 --> 1:13:14.780
You're jumping again.

1:13:14.799 --> 1:13:16.057
I'm what?

1:13:16.134 --> 1:13:17.875
You do this thing
where you leap from job to job,

1:13:17.894 --> 1:13:19.285
city to city.

1:13:19.303 --> 1:13:21.729
What are you afraid of?

1:13:21.881 --> 1:13:23.898
I'm not scared of anything.

1:13:26.811 --> 1:13:28.569
Falling in love can be scary.

1:13:30.556 --> 1:13:33.199
Well, it's been a long flight
and an even longer day

1:13:34.652 --> 1:13:35.801
and I think tomorrow
is gonna be really,

1:13:35.803 --> 1:13:37.470
really exciting.

1:13:37.472 --> 1:13:39.305
Let's go home.

1:13:39.323 --> 1:13:41.807
Oh, I'm so glad
you could make it home in

1:13:41.826 --> 1:13:42.975
time for Christmas.

1:13:42.994 --> 1:13:44.234
Me too.

1:13:44.254 --> 1:13:46.921
Oh, um and if you
see any lasagne in the yard,

1:13:48.240 --> 1:13:49.982
could you just ignore it?

1:13:50.001 --> 1:13:52.409
You did try to
cook again, didn't you?

1:13:52.429 --> 1:13:54.220
Uh, yeah.

1:13:55.765 --> 1:13:57.432
It's good that
you reach for the stars.

1:14:31.468 --> 1:14:33.593
No, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

1:14:37.365 --> 1:14:38.473
Sorry.

1:14:38.624 --> 1:14:39.865
Natalie.

1:14:39.884 --> 1:14:41.200
I'm sorry.

1:14:41.219 --> 1:14:43.478
Your terribleness in
the kitchen is contagious.

1:14:43.554 --> 1:14:46.230
Uh, you'll be
glad I said something.

1:14:47.391 --> 1:14:49.299
Merry Christmas.

1:14:49.319 --> 1:14:50.318
Thank you.

1:14:50.394 --> 1:14:53.154
Oh, you
should open that now.

1:14:54.657 --> 1:14:56.657
Merry Christmas to you,
too.

1:14:56.809 --> 1:14:59.160
Oh.

1:14:59.237 --> 1:15:00.828
You didn't have
to do that.

1:15:00.905 --> 1:15:03.164
Come on,
bella signorina first.

1:15:04.909 --> 1:15:07.168
If you insist.

1:15:09.154 --> 1:15:11.839
Is this the recipe
for the mystery sauce?

1:15:15.011 --> 1:15:17.178
You're actually giving
away the mystery?

1:15:17.329 --> 1:15:19.972
Yeah, and this way you don't lie
awake at night wondering.

1:15:22.835 --> 1:15:24.001
Rosemary.

1:15:24.020 --> 1:15:25.244
[chuckles]

1:15:25.263 --> 1:15:26.412
Of course.

1:15:26.430 --> 1:15:28.097
How did I not guess that?

1:15:28.249 --> 1:15:30.024
Maybe when you go
back to your city, you can

1:15:30.175 --> 1:15:32.485
find someone somehow
who can cook it for you.

1:15:34.013 --> 1:15:35.921
Not just a pizza
delivery boy, huh?

1:15:35.940 --> 1:15:37.681
[Stefano]
Capito?

1:15:37.700 --> 1:15:40.259
Okay.

1:15:40.278 --> 1:15:41.610
Your turn.

1:15:41.763 --> 1:15:43.663
[clear throat]

1:15:50.029 --> 1:15:52.938
Olio d'oliva descadoni.

1:15:52.940 --> 1:15:55.941
Natalie.

1:15:55.960 --> 1:15:58.052
Grazie.

1:16:05.469 --> 1:16:08.312
[inhales and exhales]

1:16:12.310 --> 1:16:13.793
What's it smell like?

1:16:13.811 --> 1:16:16.887
Like home.

1:16:16.906 --> 1:16:19.740
I'm sorry you couldn't
be home for Christmas.

1:16:19.817 --> 1:16:22.577
I know,
this is my home now.

1:16:30.086 --> 1:16:32.753
I still think you could use
a pinch of thyme.

1:16:36.593 --> 1:16:37.983
[sighs]

1:16:38.002 --> 1:16:39.835
Where are the little elves?

1:16:39.987 --> 1:16:41.762
-Tyler was here
-Be here.

1:16:41.914 --> 1:16:43.005
He told me that he needed
to add

1:16:43.157 --> 1:16:44.673
something outside,
I don't know.

1:16:44.826 --> 1:16:46.058
Okay.

1:16:52.683 --> 1:16:54.925
[kisses]

1:16:54.944 --> 1:16:56.426
[Natalie clear throat]

1:16:56.446 --> 1:16:57.928
Merry Christmas.

1:16:57.947 --> 1:16:59.188
-[Beebee] Merry Christmas.
-[Tyler] Merry Christmas.

1:16:59.340 --> 1:17:00.522
Are you guys
ready to get to work?

1:17:00.675 --> 1:17:02.024
-Mhmm, mhmm, yeah.
-Sure, totally ready.

1:17:02.176 --> 1:17:03.266
Great.

1:17:03.286 --> 1:17:04.785
Places, everybody.

1:17:09.200 --> 1:17:11.108
Turns out
that he likes braces.

1:17:11.127 --> 1:17:11.959
[Natalie laughs]

1:17:32.890 --> 1:17:34.223

[indistinct speech]

1:19:10.580 --> 1:19:11.804
I know I'm so hungry,

1:19:11.806 --> 1:19:14.582

Okay, go.

1:20:16.370 --> 1:20:17.645
That was suspenseful.

1:20:20.207 --> 1:20:21.482
This is for you.

1:20:21.633 --> 1:20:23.892
You need to keep

1:20:24.045 --> 1:20:26.728
Cocoa with whipped cream
and nutmeg.

1:20:26.881 --> 1:20:28.213
How'd you know
my favorite cocoa?

Hey, I know.

1:20:30.660 --> 1:20:32.642
I asked cugina Olivia.

1:20:32.662 --> 1:20:35.554
Even with everything else
you had to do?

1:20:35.573 --> 1:20:37.957
-Thank you.
-Prego.

1:20:41.912 --> 1:20:43.320
Mmm.

1:20:45.174 --> 1:20:46.323
Scusi.

1:20:56.335 --> 1:20:58.260
[laughs]

1:20:58.412 --> 1:20:59.520
Do I have food in my teeth?

1:20:59.597 --> 1:21:01.246
Uh, not your teeth, no.

1:21:01.265 --> 1:21:03.506
[Stefano aughing]

1:21:03.526 --> 1:21:04.507
[laughing]

1:21:04.527 --> 1:21:06.343
Alright.

1:21:06.362 --> 1:21:07.436
[sighs]

1:21:07.588 --> 1:21:10.089
[chuckling]

1:21:10.107 --> 1:21:12.366
Can you get me
a napkin or something?

1:21:15.429 --> 1:21:17.204
Si, si.

1:21:20.543 --> 1:21:23.526
Now didn't I remember that
there was a polar bear

1:21:23.546 --> 1:21:25.938
-in your driveway one time?
-Not anymore, not anymore,

1:21:25.956 --> 1:21:27.697
I since I've moved here

1:21:27.717 --> 1:21:29.775
Oh, thank you.

1:21:29.793 --> 1:21:31.368
We saw one last night,
we did.

1:21:31.387 --> 1:21:33.703
Please try the pasta.

1:21:33.723 --> 1:21:35.389
We it's a family recipe.

1:21:35.466 --> 1:21:37.783
-I hope you like it.
-Mangiamo.

1:21:37.801 --> 1:21:40.644
[indistinct chatter]

1:21:48.312 --> 1:21:49.811

1:21:49.964 --> 1:21:51.071
[indistinct chatter]

1:21:51.148 --> 1:21:53.073
Huh.

1:21:53.225 --> 1:21:55.034
Hmm.

1:22:13.262 --> 1:22:16.055
[indistinct chatter]

1:22:20.678 --> 1:22:22.770
[Miles]
Ladies and gentlemen,

1:22:24.273 --> 1:22:27.166
I have been reviewing
restaurants for over 20 years.

1:22:27.184 --> 1:22:30.002
It has been my privilege
to dine in some of the finest

1:22:30.020 --> 1:22:32.947
establishments
in this country.

1:22:33.098 --> 1:22:35.932
And in that time I have
never, not once,

1:22:35.952 --> 1:22:37.952
tasted a perfect dish.

1:22:41.624 --> 1:22:44.016
Until now.

1:22:44.034 --> 1:22:45.200
[indistinct chatter]

1:22:45.352 --> 1:22:47.110
[Caroler]
Bravo to the chef.

1:22:47.129 --> 1:22:49.129
Take your bow.

1:22:49.206 --> 1:22:50.706
[Caroler 1]
Oh, come on, Chef.

1:22:50.858 --> 1:22:52.633
Take your bows.

1:22:54.712 --> 1:22:56.971
[indistinct speech]

1:22:57.047 --> 1:22:59.881
Thank you, thank you
very much.

1:23:00.034 --> 1:23:02.384
[indistinct speech]

1:23:02.536 --> 1:23:04.627
Hope you enjoyed.

1:23:04.647 --> 1:23:06.796
-[Miles] Thank you.
-[Stefano] Grazie.

1:23:06.816 --> 1:23:09.400
Natalie, may I speak
with you a moment?

1:23:10.561 --> 1:23:12.302
Yeah, of course.

1:23:12.321 --> 1:23:13.895
Uh, alone.

1:23:14.048 --> 1:23:14.971
Sure.

1:23:14.991 --> 1:23:16.824
Um, over here.

1:23:19.161 --> 1:23:21.644
[Laughter]

1:23:21.664 --> 1:23:23.163
Everything okay with the meal?

1:23:23.240 --> 1:23:25.165
Can I get you anything else?

1:23:25.317 --> 1:23:27.334
Oh, it's the most
wonderful feast of Natale

1:23:27.486 --> 1:23:28.727
I've ever had.

1:23:28.729 --> 1:23:31.505
Not about that I want
to ask you.

1:23:31.656 --> 1:23:34.583
It is uh,
you do not actually work

1:23:34.735 --> 1:23:37.569
for Pezzo Di Parma,
this is correct?

1:23:37.571 --> 1:23:38.846
That's right.

1:23:38.922 --> 1:23:40.422
I have my own business.

1:23:40.574 --> 1:23:43.075
Or businesses really,
in the city.

1:23:43.077 --> 1:23:44.667
Good.

1:23:44.687 --> 1:23:47.596
I am hoping that Stefano
will offer me a job

1:23:47.748 --> 1:23:50.582
once you return
to the city.

1:23:50.601 --> 1:23:53.252
But you're singing.

1:23:53.270 --> 1:23:55.779
I like Stefano.

1:23:56.940 --> 1:23:59.758
Oh.

1:23:59.760 --> 1:24:02.018
I see.

1:24:02.038 --> 1:24:03.871
[Ariella]
You are friends with Stefano?

1:24:03.947 --> 1:24:06.932
Do you think that maybe

1:24:06.950 --> 1:24:08.709
he likes me?

1:24:11.121 --> 1:24:12.963
I don't know.

1:24:15.943 --> 1:24:17.718
Um, I

1:24:19.388 --> 1:24:21.638
I think you're perfect
for him.

1:24:40.634 --> 1:24:42.392
Beautiful.

1:24:42.411 --> 1:24:44.244
Exquisite.

1:24:44.396 --> 1:24:46.914
Stefano.

1:24:47.065 --> 1:24:49.991
Ah, it'll be ready
in a minute.

1:24:50.144 --> 1:24:52.811
[Natalie]
Great, um, maybe you can give
Ariella a minute

1:24:52.830 --> 1:24:54.713
to talk to you.

1:24:56.333 --> 1:24:58.984
And you might wanna look
at this

1:24:59.002 --> 1:25:00.719
in case you forgot.

1:25:01.931 --> 1:25:03.889
Grazie.

1:25:12.516 --> 1:25:13.756
[Stefano]
Ciao.

1:25:13.776 --> 1:25:14.691
Ciao.

1:25:19.598 --> 1:25:22.449
[Sobs]

1:25:32.035 --> 1:25:34.253
We need to change it.

1:25:37.708 --> 1:25:40.300
Thyme.

1:25:40.377 --> 1:25:41.877
Really?

1:25:42.029 --> 1:25:44.045
You took my advice?

1:25:44.198 --> 1:25:46.890
Only because uh,
it was right.

1:25:53.557 --> 1:25:54.797
Natalie.

1:25:54.817 --> 1:25:56.483
Why so sad on Christmas?

1:25:58.395 --> 1:26:01.062
I'm not sad.

1:26:01.215 --> 1:26:03.231
I'm happy for you
and Ariella.

1:26:03.384 --> 1:26:04.474
Me and Ariella?

1:26:04.493 --> 1:26:06.718
Of course.

1:26:06.737 --> 1:26:08.887
She likes you,
you have to know that.

1:26:08.906 --> 1:26:10.664
Yes.

1:26:10.815 --> 1:26:12.499
And I told her I was
happy to give her a job.

1:26:15.729 --> 1:26:18.505
Not all my heart.

1:26:20.918 --> 1:26:23.235
But she fits
right in with your

1:26:23.253 --> 1:26:25.846
philosophy of logic, and love,
life, and cooking.

1:26:27.741 --> 1:26:29.183
She fits your list
to a tee.

1:26:37.751 --> 1:26:39.860
Natalie, my philosophy
has changed.

1:26:44.349 --> 1:26:46.200
To what?

1:26:53.267 --> 1:26:54.691
Panettone!

1:26:54.710 --> 1:26:56.376
The panettone!

1:26:57.713 --> 1:27:00.631
[coughing]

1:27:03.293 --> 1:27:04.626
[Natalie]
What happened?

1:27:04.778 --> 1:27:06.720
Panettone, I burned
the panettone.

1:27:06.871 --> 1:27:08.296
[speaking Italian]

1:27:08.449 --> 1:27:10.782
But a chef never lets
his food burn.

1:27:10.801 --> 1:27:13.134
Not for anything.

1:27:13.287 --> 1:27:14.377
I forgot.

1:27:14.396 --> 1:27:15.787
How could you forget?

1:27:15.789 --> 1:27:17.731
What are we gonna do
about dessert?

1:27:17.882 --> 1:27:19.983
They're almost finished
with the main course.

1:27:21.886 --> 1:27:23.904
We know.

1:27:28.410 --> 1:27:31.036
[Natalie]
The cookies.

1:27:34.065 --> 1:27:36.416
Aha.

1:27:36.493 --> 1:27:38.585
[Olivia]
Try the red ones.

1:27:38.737 --> 1:27:40.812
Alright.

1:27:40.831 --> 1:27:43.331
There is a family
tradition that we have

1:27:43.484 --> 1:27:44.983
where you go around
the dinner table

1:27:45.002 --> 1:27:47.219
and say what the best part of
this Christmas is.

1:27:48.672 --> 1:27:51.172
I guess I'll go first.

1:27:51.325 --> 1:27:52.766
Um, for me the best
part of this Christmas

1:27:52.843 --> 1:27:54.083
is being able to get home
in time

1:27:54.103 --> 1:27:56.344
to share it with
all of you.

1:27:56.497 --> 1:27:59.164
And my cousin Natalie,
and my friend Stefano,

1:27:59.182 --> 1:28:01.424
who made all of this
possible.

1:28:01.443 --> 1:28:03.760
[laughing]

1:28:03.779 --> 1:28:06.095
The best part of this Christmas
has been sharing

1:28:06.115 --> 1:28:08.264
this meal with all of you all

1:28:08.284 --> 1:28:10.509
and my elastic waistband

1:28:10.527 --> 1:28:13.361
which made all of
it possible.

1:28:13.514 --> 1:28:15.205
[Natalie]
Cheers.

1:28:17.609 --> 1:28:20.294
Oh, um my favorite part
of this Christmas

1:28:24.207 --> 1:28:27.208
is um, well,
I've always kind of been

1:28:27.361 --> 1:28:30.119
jumping around from job to job,
waiting for

1:28:30.139 --> 1:28:32.697
something to tell me that

1:28:32.716 --> 1:28:35.309
I finally have found
the perfect thing.

1:28:35.460 --> 1:28:38.386
And nothing ever
felt quite right.

1:28:38.539 --> 1:28:41.222
But this year, this
Christmas

1:28:41.375 --> 1:28:42.482
[inhales]

1:28:42.559 --> 1:28:45.152
um, I finally found a place that
feels like home.

1:28:48.065 --> 1:28:49.906
And someone

1:28:52.069 --> 1:28:54.161
I'd really like to
share it with.

1:29:02.563 --> 1:29:04.079
Stefano.

1:29:04.231 --> 1:29:05.505
My favorite part
of this Christmas,

1:29:05.582 --> 1:29:08.467
uh well

1:29:15.926 --> 1:29:18.259
You, Natalie.

1:29:18.412 --> 1:29:21.188
It is this.

1:29:30.199 --> 1:29:33.200
[kissing]

1:29:33.276 --> 1:29:36.185
[Guests cheering]

1:29:36.205 --> 1:29:38.263
Why are we all watching?

1:29:38.281 --> 1:29:39.664
Oh my gosh!
