WEBVTT

00:16.551 --> 00:17.862
That will kill her!

00:17.862 --> 00:19.241
- And you're going to
hit her with it.

00:19.241 --> 00:21.206
- MALE Previously
on "The Oval"--

00:21.206 --> 00:23.379
Can I help you with that?

00:25.241 --> 00:26.758
- I wanted to see if
you're okay.

00:26.758 --> 00:28.931
- I don't want to
talk to you.

00:28.931 --> 00:30.206
- I think I know who
did this.

00:30.206 --> 00:31.206
- So you're part of some
department

00:31.206 --> 00:32.310
and didn't even tell me?

00:32.310 --> 00:33.758
- Sam--
- Which one is it?

00:33.758 --> 00:36.206
- Go--
- CIA, FBI?

00:36.206 --> 00:38.793
- I need a gun, Alonzo.
- What do you need a gun for?

00:38.793 --> 00:40.448
Protection.

00:40.448 --> 00:41.586
Don't move!

00:41.586 --> 00:42.758
- VOICE ON Who
are you with?

00:42.758 --> 00:43.689
What the hell?

00:50.310 --> 00:52.620
- Where the hell are
they taking you?

00:56.275 --> 00:58.482
I knew that would happen.

01:09.827 --> 01:12.241
Way smarter than that.

01:12.241 --> 01:17.344
- Who's there?
I know you can hear me.

01:17.344 --> 01:20.172
I can hear you breathing.

01:22.241 --> 01:24.965
- Taking him to
the White House.

01:24.965 --> 01:26.206
What the hell?

01:29.413 --> 01:32.793
- Ladies and gentlemen,
the president and first lady.

01:32.793 --> 01:38.137
- MALE

01:59.862 --> 02:04.586
- Kyle.
- Yes?

02:04.586 --> 02:06.241
- Is that all the love
I get?

02:06.241 --> 02:08.413
What is it?

02:08.413 --> 02:11.896
Oh, he is mad.

02:11.896 --> 02:13.758
I am pretty busy, Donald.

02:13.758 --> 02:16.275
- Okay, well I need you
to take your busy self

02:16.275 --> 02:19.551
up to the residence
and keep an eye on Jason.

02:19.551 --> 02:22.448
- What?
- Yes.

02:22.448 --> 02:24.689
- What are you talking
about?

02:24.689 --> 02:26.655
- Just do what I'm telling
you to do.

02:26.655 --> 02:29.379
- Why are you telling me to do
it?

02:29.379 --> 02:33.172
- Agent Flint, are you
disobeying my command?

02:33.172 --> 02:35.379
- I just want to know why,
Donald.

02:35.379 --> 02:36.620
- Because I told you
to do it,

02:36.620 --> 02:38.344
and that's all the reason
you need.

02:41.344 --> 02:45.551
- Ah, okay, I see.
So, you're mad at me,

02:45.551 --> 02:48.172
so you put me on that
creepy kid, huh?

02:48.172 --> 02:50.551
No, no smart ass.

02:50.551 --> 02:53.310
Actually, the doctor that
I hired called this morning

02:53.310 --> 02:54.620
and said
that she spoke to him

02:54.620 --> 02:56.275
and he's having a manic
episode,

02:56.275 --> 02:57.448
is that enough for you?

02:57.448 --> 02:58.965
Well then get her here!

02:58.965 --> 03:01.655
- Just do what the hell I'm
telling you to do, Kyle.

03:01.655 --> 03:03.551
- Yes, sir,
is that all?

03:03.551 --> 03:05.896
- Yes.
Yes, that's all.

03:05.896 --> 03:07.241
Yes, sir.

03:07.241 --> 03:10.551
- Kyle?
- Sir?

03:10.551 --> 03:12.344
- You know, I don't know
if I like this attitude.

03:12.344 --> 03:14.655
Sir, let's just do our jobs.

03:14.655 --> 03:17.310
I got a job for you.

03:17.310 --> 03:19.413
Sir, that is inappropriate.

03:19.413 --> 03:22.793
- Oh, so now we're being all
professional, huh?

03:22.793 --> 03:26.275
- That's what you just said
that you would like to do.

03:26.275 --> 03:28.758
Yeah, yeah, I guess it is.

03:28.758 --> 03:32.137
- Well then,
if you don't mind...

03:32.137 --> 03:34.517
I need to go to the residence.

03:34.517 --> 03:38.655
- Yeah.
Yeah, you do that. Hm?

03:38.655 --> 03:41.551
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

03:43.310 --> 03:45.000
This little bitch.

03:49.344 --> 03:52.206
Hey, Bobby.

03:52.206 --> 03:53.620
Yeah?

03:53.620 --> 03:55.344
- I been called
to the White House.

03:55.344 --> 03:57.000
Okay, be careful.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.724
Okay.

03:58.724 --> 04:00.068
Wait.

04:00.068 --> 04:01.241
What?

04:01.241 --> 04:02.482
You going now?

04:02.482 --> 04:04.344
Yeah.

04:04.344 --> 04:06.517
- Okay, what car are
you driving?

04:09.241 --> 04:11.931
Mine.

04:11.931 --> 04:13.689
Okay.

04:13.689 --> 04:16.137
I have to ask you something.

04:16.137 --> 04:17.724
What?

04:17.724 --> 04:20.655
- This could blow it
all apart.

04:20.655 --> 04:23.517
What is it, Bobby?

04:23.517 --> 04:25.862
- I need to get into
the White House.

04:25.862 --> 04:27.103
What?

04:27.103 --> 04:29.000
I think they have Max there.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.758
Look, I have a tracker in his
shoe,

04:30.758 --> 04:33.241
I'll know exactly where
he is within two feet.

04:33.241 --> 04:35.586
- Okay, and how will you do
that?

04:35.586 --> 04:38.103
- You design for her.
Your assistants,

04:38.103 --> 04:39.724
they're on the list,
right?

04:39.724 --> 04:44.517
- Okay, no, there is no way
in hell that's gonna work.

04:44.517 --> 04:46.517
- Your husband can
authorize visitors.

04:46.517 --> 04:48.344
I can give you an alias,

04:48.344 --> 04:49.379
you can give it to his
assistant,

04:49.379 --> 04:51.896
he can clear me.

04:51.896 --> 04:53.931
You sure?

04:53.931 --> 04:57.862
- If I don't get in there,
they'll kill him.

04:57.862 --> 05:02.586
- Okay, and if you get in,
how are you gonna get him out?

05:02.586 --> 05:04.965
- I don't know,
one thing at a time.

05:04.965 --> 05:07.103
- Alright, Bobby,
I do not like this at all--

05:07.103 --> 05:11.689
- Look, if they break him,
we can lose everything.

05:11.689 --> 05:13.482
- What if they have him
in a secure spot?

05:13.482 --> 05:14.965
They don't.

05:14.965 --> 05:16.448
This part of the White House
isn't secure.

05:16.448 --> 05:17.931
- Alright, what if they
move him?

05:17.931 --> 05:19.758
- Lilly, I just need you to get
me--

05:19.758 --> 05:21.931
- Okay, why don't you let me see
if I can get to him first, okay?

05:21.931 --> 05:23.482
- No, no, no, no,
that is too dangerous.

05:23.482 --> 05:25.758
- Okay, and you going up
in there isn't?

05:25.758 --> 05:27.482
Look, I can't let you do it.

05:27.482 --> 05:29.448
Alright?
Call him.

05:29.448 --> 05:31.034
- Let me talk to Sam first,
alright?

05:31.034 --> 05:32.620
- Maybe that will work--
- No, no, no, no,

05:32.620 --> 05:34.379
call him, tell him my name
is Byron Charles.

05:34.379 --> 05:36.724
Give him this social.

05:38.896 --> 05:40.137
Here.

05:40.137 --> 05:41.344
Tell him I'll be delivering
some packages

05:41.344 --> 05:43.862
to the residents
for you.

05:43.862 --> 05:46.241
Call him.

05:46.241 --> 05:48.172
- I'm doing this for Max,
okay?

05:55.827 --> 06:00.586
Hello?
Hi, Allan, yes, hi.

06:00.586 --> 06:03.620
Look, I need to put someone
on the White House list.

06:03.620 --> 06:06.655
Yeah, they'll need clearance
for the main level.

06:06.655 --> 06:10.965
Mm-hmm.
Oh, his name is Byron Charles.

06:10.965 --> 06:12.344
Okay.

06:12.344 --> 06:16.206
Uh-huh.
24983657, yes.

06:16.206 --> 06:18.275
Alright,
thank you, Allan.

06:20.827 --> 06:24.586
Don't -- me over
on this one.

06:24.586 --> 06:26.586
Can I have my card back?

06:28.724 --> 06:30.827
After you get Max.

06:33.034 --> 06:34.620
Love that girl.

06:42.310 --> 06:43.931
Why are you standing there?

06:43.931 --> 06:48.931
Come, come, come,
come here, come here.

06:48.931 --> 06:51.172
Why are you standing there?

06:51.172 --> 06:54.655
- I was--
- You were what?

06:54.655 --> 06:56.000
- I was asked by the chief
of staff

06:56.000 --> 06:58.586
to keep an eye on your son,
ma'am.

06:58.586 --> 07:03.551
- Why?
- I'm not sure, ma'am.

07:03.551 --> 07:07.448
- No.
You know why.

07:07.448 --> 07:09.206
And why's that?

07:09.206 --> 07:14.344
- Because that little bastard
is crazy.

07:14.344 --> 07:16.172
Well, ma'am...

07:16.172 --> 07:20.413
What? You disagree?

07:20.413 --> 07:22.448
I have no judgements, ma'am.

07:22.448 --> 07:24.586
Oh, I see.

07:24.586 --> 07:30.034
So he kills people and
you don't judge him?

07:30.034 --> 07:31.758
No, ma'am.

07:31.758 --> 07:37.137
- So you open a trunk,
and see a dead girl in there,

07:37.137 --> 07:40.413
and you don't judge him?

07:40.413 --> 07:42.586
No, ma'am.

07:42.586 --> 07:45.724
Just get rid of the body, huh?

07:45.724 --> 07:47.241
I'm here to serve, ma'am.

07:47.241 --> 07:52.758
- Yes, yes, you are.
And to serve Donald.

07:52.758 --> 07:55.310
That too, ma'am.

07:55.310 --> 07:59.793
- You do know that Hunter
will never sleep with you.

07:59.793 --> 08:01.586
- Well, that's good to
know, ma'am.

08:01.586 --> 08:04.482
So you can stop trying.

08:04.482 --> 08:08.827
- I'm not trying, ma'am.

08:08.827 --> 08:10.931
Honey, if he batted
his eyes at you,

08:10.931 --> 08:13.000
you'd be all over him.

08:16.827 --> 08:19.862
- Ma'am, is there something
that I can help you with?

08:19.862 --> 08:22.862
Are you trying to dismiss me?

08:22.862 --> 08:26.275
- No. No, ma'am,
absolutely not.

08:26.275 --> 08:30.379
- Yes. There is something you
can do for me.

08:30.379 --> 08:32.896
And what is it?

08:32.896 --> 08:36.689
- Tell me why you're
standing there.

08:36.689 --> 08:39.275
- Ma'am, I am telling you
I am not sure.

08:39.275 --> 08:43.241
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I get it, I get it.

08:43.241 --> 08:46.517
Hunter's downstairs
after that whore,

08:46.517 --> 08:52.034
and he wants to make sure that
Jason is locked in his room.

08:52.034 --> 08:53.655
- I don't know what you mean,
ma'am.

08:53.655 --> 08:58.655
- Yeah, yup, yup.
He will decapitate a bitch.

08:58.655 --> 09:00.344
- Again, ma'am--

09:00.344 --> 09:04.034
He's just protecting her.

09:04.034 --> 09:06.482
He doesn't give a damn that
that little serial killer

09:06.482 --> 09:09.034
is close to me.

09:09.034 --> 09:14.068
It's all about that
whore downstairs.

09:14.068 --> 09:17.241
So they sent you up here for
her?

09:17.241 --> 09:21.103
- No ma'am, I'm here to keep
an eye on your son.

09:21.103 --> 09:24.310
- So my husband can --
the press secretary.

09:24.310 --> 09:26.344
- I know nothing about that,
ma'am.

09:26.344 --> 09:27.965
You should.

09:27.965 --> 09:30.724
You had that other bitch
in the bed in here.

09:30.724 --> 09:33.172
You know the one that lost
her head.

09:33.172 --> 09:37.275
You were outside of this door,
and didn't tell him

09:37.275 --> 09:39.000
that we had come back.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.275
- I wasn't aware that
you were back, ma'am.

09:42.275 --> 09:44.689
- What kind of Secret Service
are you

09:44.689 --> 09:46.413
that you're not aware?

09:46.413 --> 09:48.689
- Ma'am, Max was on duty down at
the command--

09:48.689 --> 09:52.586
Oh Max, Max.

09:52.586 --> 09:54.758
Now there's a real man.

09:54.758 --> 09:58.896
- Excuse me?

09:58.896 --> 10:01.344
You, doubt it?

10:01.344 --> 10:04.241
No ma'am.

10:04.241 --> 10:09.896
- Because if he wasn't,
he wouldn't be alive.

10:09.896 --> 10:12.482
Your bitch ass could have
killed him,

10:12.482 --> 10:18.827
but yet you didn't.

10:18.827 --> 10:22.000
Try to learn how to be
deadly, girl.

10:35.482 --> 10:39.137
- Try to learn how to walk
in those shoes, girl.

10:51.241 --> 10:53.586
Hello.

10:53.586 --> 10:55.931
Why hello.

10:55.931 --> 10:59.931
You're not answering my calls.

10:59.931 --> 11:05.172
- I've been doing press calls
and...

11:05.172 --> 11:09.206
- I don't like it when
you don't answer my calls.

11:09.206 --> 11:12.655
- Hunter, I've been here
all night. All night.

11:12.655 --> 11:17.034
- Sounds like you need a break,
why don't you come see me?

11:19.482 --> 11:22.137
- Hunter, look at me.
- I am looking at you.

11:30.344 --> 11:33.241
It's over.

11:33.241 --> 11:35.172
What?

11:35.172 --> 11:36.551
Yeah.

11:36.551 --> 11:39.448
We're not over.

11:39.448 --> 11:41.206
It's over.

11:41.206 --> 11:44.586
Why do you think we're over?

11:44.586 --> 11:46.931
I'm telling you, okay?

11:46.931 --> 11:50.551
Just...we're done.

11:52.413 --> 11:54.655
No way.

11:54.655 --> 11:56.689
Yes, we are.

11:56.689 --> 11:59.379
Why you think that?

11:59.379 --> 12:03.413
- Have you seen the press,
social media?

12:03.413 --> 12:05.758
Nobody's talking about your
assassination attempt,

12:05.758 --> 12:11.517
because everyone's too busy
calling me your "little whore."

12:11.517 --> 12:15.965
Well, you kind of are.

12:15.965 --> 12:17.448
Oh, you think it's funny?

12:17.448 --> 12:19.896
Kind of funny.

12:19.896 --> 12:25.275
Okay. Wow.

12:25.275 --> 12:28.000
I really--I really thought
you'd better than this,

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
considering you were
almost killed.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.310
- Oh, don't worry,
I'm gonna find the guy

12:33.310 --> 12:37.448
responsible for this and
they're gonna be sorry.

12:37.448 --> 12:39.206
- Okay.
- Yeah.

12:39.206 --> 12:43.034
You should focus on that.

12:43.034 --> 12:47.896
- Come on, don't pretend you're
not glad I'm okay.

12:47.896 --> 12:50.275
I'm glad you're okay.

12:50.275 --> 12:52.655
- Well then come see me--
- Hunter, I'm serious.

12:52.655 --> 12:54.344
No, come on.

12:54.344 --> 12:56.103
- You need to go back
to the Oval.

12:56.103 --> 12:57.448
- I'm gonna go back
to the Oval,

12:57.448 --> 12:58.931
just come with me.

12:58.931 --> 13:01.379
- You need to go back to
the Oval.

13:01.379 --> 13:05.724
- Oh, look at you being very
demanding.

13:05.724 --> 13:09.482
- I'm sorry. Go.
- Come on.

13:10.586 --> 13:13.758
Yes, dear, go.

13:13.758 --> 13:16.896
What in the hell?

13:16.896 --> 13:18.379
What are you doing here?

13:18.379 --> 13:21.310
- I was, um--I was
training--

13:21.310 --> 13:22.896
Trying to cause more trouble?

13:22.896 --> 13:26.482
- No, no,
what do you want?

13:26.482 --> 13:30.482
- I want to speak with
our friend.

13:30.482 --> 13:32.275
- No, that's--
that's not happening,

13:32.275 --> 13:33.827
you're not talking to her.

13:33.827 --> 13:37.655
- Well apparently she's not
talking to you, either.

13:37.655 --> 13:41.137
- Why don't you just go back
to the residence?

13:41.137 --> 13:44.793
- It's not happening.
- Why not?

13:44.793 --> 13:47.344
- Not as long as you're
down here.

13:49.862 --> 13:52.793
- Okay, okay, fine.
Let's go.

13:52.793 --> 13:55.724
Thank you.

13:55.724 --> 13:59.551
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
now come on.

13:59.551 --> 14:01.448
- I told you I want to
talk to her.

14:01.448 --> 14:05.310
- No, no, no, I'm not leaving
you down here alone with her.

14:05.310 --> 14:11.655
- Why not?
- Just, come on, Victoria.

14:11.655 --> 14:14.827
- Let's go.
- Fine.

14:18.241 --> 14:21.379
- These people are crazy.

14:24.793 --> 14:26.413
Oh my god.

14:34.137 --> 14:36.275
- You can't ever say anything
about me and Sharon.

14:36.275 --> 14:38.586
- You know why I say something
about you and Sharon?

14:38.586 --> 14:39.896
Why?

14:39.896 --> 14:41.551
This is my house.

14:41.551 --> 14:46.586
- Okay, you got it.
I need to talk to Dad.

14:46.586 --> 14:50.862
- He's sleep.
- Why are you smiling like that?

14:50.862 --> 14:55.068
- What?
- Ew, Ma. That is nasty!

14:55.068 --> 14:57.137
- That is nasty!
- Boy, grow up!

14:57.137 --> 14:58.689
- Oh my god,
when is he gonna be up?

14:58.689 --> 15:00.206
I need to talk to him.

15:00.206 --> 15:02.517
- I don't know, he might
be out all night after that.

15:02.517 --> 15:04.344
- Ma, do you know how
inappropriate this is?

15:04.344 --> 15:06.931
- Boy, shut up.
How you think you got here?

15:06.931 --> 15:08.344
- I don't wanna think
about it.

15:08.344 --> 15:10.448
And what is it anyway?

15:10.448 --> 15:13.620
- I need to talk to Sam.
- What's going on?

15:13.620 --> 15:15.724
- Nothing, I just
remembered something.

15:15.724 --> 15:18.000
- Okay, well call him,
let your Daddy sleep.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.413
- Okay, I will.
- Thank you.

15:20.413 --> 15:22.344
Where you goin'?

15:22.344 --> 15:25.482
- I'm going to warm up
his breakfast.

15:25.482 --> 15:27.103
- You're gonna wash
your hands first, right?

15:27.103 --> 15:29.379
- Boy, don't be trying to
use my words on me.

15:29.379 --> 15:31.000
- Shut up!
- Learned from the best.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.034
I'm just saying.

15:34.034 --> 15:36.379
Old people sex. Uh!

15:45.241 --> 15:47.275
What the hell do you want?

15:47.275 --> 15:50.206
So you put Kyle on him?

15:50.206 --> 15:52.241
What are you talking about?

15:52.241 --> 15:54.413
- You had Kyle keeping
an eye on Jason

15:54.413 --> 15:56.758
while you were downstairs
after that girl.

15:56.758 --> 15:59.448
Oh, will you give it a rest?

15:59.448 --> 16:03.275
- So you don't want your son
to kill this one?

16:03.275 --> 16:07.896
- Uh, no, but I'm sure
you do.

16:07.896 --> 16:11.448
I do.

16:11.448 --> 16:14.724
- What kind of mother
are you?

16:14.724 --> 16:16.482
- Are you really telling me that
you think

16:16.482 --> 16:19.655
you're father of the year?

16:19.655 --> 16:23.000
- I am what I am, darling.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.689
Yeah,
well if Kyle was standing

16:24.689 --> 16:28.965
outside of the door and he
didn't know your son

16:28.965 --> 16:31.689
had cut that girl's damn head
off,

16:31.689 --> 16:35.517
how then will he keep an
eye on him now?

16:37.551 --> 16:39.827
Victoria, he's Secret Service,

16:39.827 --> 16:42.724
who else is gonna do it?
He's got it handled.

16:42.724 --> 16:45.413
- Okay, he's got it.
- Yeah.

16:45.413 --> 16:48.172
- But what he doesn't have
is the ability

16:48.172 --> 16:52.000
to keep your shit a secret.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.482
What do you want?

16:54.482 --> 16:56.689
- I told you,
I want her gone.

16:56.689 --> 17:01.172
- And I told you,
we're not talking about that.

17:01.172 --> 17:05.310
- Okay.
Well I'll get rid of her.

17:05.310 --> 17:07.965
You couldn't if you tried.

17:07.965 --> 17:09.689
Why would you think that?

17:09.689 --> 17:12.241
- And by the way,
she knows too much,

17:12.241 --> 17:14.551
gotta keep her close.

17:14.551 --> 17:19.896
- Well, Hunter,
she could die.

17:19.896 --> 17:23.448
- You--you're gonna kill her?

17:23.448 --> 17:26.275
You don't think that would
look suspicious?

17:26.275 --> 17:28.379
Did my mother's death?

17:28.379 --> 17:31.000
- So now you're gonna
crash a plane?

17:31.000 --> 17:34.965
If that's what it takes.

17:34.965 --> 17:37.896
- You know what?
You--you pretend

17:37.896 --> 17:39.172
to have all this power,

17:39.172 --> 17:40.965
but you really--
you don't have any.

17:40.965 --> 17:43.000
Okay, alright Hunter.

17:43.000 --> 17:48.103
- But, hey, if you really
want to kill someone,

17:48.103 --> 17:50.620
how about you start
with your father?

17:50.620 --> 17:53.310
Because I am sick of this shit.

17:53.310 --> 17:56.931
- Hunter, be careful
what you wish for.

17:56.931 --> 18:00.000
I'm wishing.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.068
- Okay.
Whatever.

18:03.068 --> 18:04.862
Where are you going?

18:04.862 --> 18:08.931
- I told you,
I want to talk to her.

18:08.931 --> 18:11.931
- And I told you you're not
talking to her.

18:11.931 --> 18:14.413
- You better stop me,
you better stop me.

18:14.413 --> 18:17.344
- Listen, don't you
go near her.

18:17.344 --> 18:19.862
Yes, dear.

18:44.413 --> 18:48.034
- Sharon?
- It's me.

18:48.034 --> 18:51.689
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:51.689 --> 18:52.965
What's up?

18:52.965 --> 18:54.793
- I'm just gonna get
the rest of my things.

18:54.793 --> 18:58.793
- Come on, Sharon.

18:58.793 --> 19:01.344
To get the rest of your
things, huh?

19:01.344 --> 19:04.655
- Come here.
- What's up?

19:04.655 --> 19:08.862
- Barry, if you're high.
- I'm not high.

19:08.862 --> 19:10.862
- Then why you looking at me
like that, why you smiling?

19:10.862 --> 19:13.862
- 'Cause, I'm just, you know,
tired of all the drama.

19:13.862 --> 19:16.275
- Yeah, so am I,
can I get my stuff now?

19:16.275 --> 19:21.000
- Yes, all your stuff
is right here.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.310
- Well damn, you just threw
them in this box?

19:23.310 --> 19:24.965
Yes.

19:24.965 --> 19:28.000
- You're such an asshole.
- Yeah, you told me.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.344
- Alright, well look,
I'm about to--

19:29.344 --> 19:31.551
- Hey, I miss you.
- Stop.

19:31.551 --> 19:33.517
- I miss you.
- Barry, what are you--

19:33.517 --> 19:35.206
- You know you miss me,
you know you miss me.

19:35.206 --> 19:36.551
Oh my god.

19:36.551 --> 19:37.758
Look, I've just been
in an accident,

19:37.758 --> 19:39.689
my body is sore,
stop squeezing me,

19:39.689 --> 19:41.689
don't got energy or strength
to deal with you right now.

19:41.689 --> 19:43.586
- Trust me,
I'm not trying to fight

19:43.586 --> 19:44.965
with you right now either.

19:44.965 --> 19:47.241
- Okay?
- Okay.

19:47.241 --> 19:48.655
- Then let me go.
- Come on, Sharon,

19:48.655 --> 19:51.827
- you know you miss me.
- Oh my God. Let me go.

19:51.827 --> 19:54.034
- Why you being like this
right now?

19:54.034 --> 19:56.241
- You're horny.
- I know.

19:56.241 --> 19:59.034
- And you get that way when
you smoke that shit, so no.

19:59.034 --> 20:01.586
Come on, Sharon.

20:01.586 --> 20:03.034
- Do you not care about
what I've been through?

20:03.034 --> 20:04.827
- Of course I care about
what you've been through,

20:04.827 --> 20:06.241
and I miss you.

20:06.241 --> 20:10.689
- Hm, well go on and miss me,
throw my shit in a box.

20:10.689 --> 20:14.862
- I was mad.
- Well stay mad.

20:14.862 --> 20:16.620
Alright, well I'ma go,
Kareem's outside

20:16.620 --> 20:19.068
waiting for me,
can you move?

20:19.068 --> 20:21.551
- What'd you say?
- Kareem.

20:21.551 --> 20:25.482
He's outside waiting for me, so
can you move?

20:25.482 --> 20:27.931
- You brought him here?
- Yes.

20:27.931 --> 20:30.482
- Why the hell would you
do something like that?

20:30.482 --> 20:33.000
- 'Cause I thought it'd make you
mad.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.620
- You know what, Sharon?
Take your stuff.

20:35.620 --> 20:37.241
- Okay.
- Yeah, okay,

20:37.241 --> 20:39.034
- go ahead then.
- Thank you, I will.

20:39.034 --> 20:41.344
Yeah, you're very welcome.

20:41.344 --> 20:42.620
You know what?
Never mind.

20:42.620 --> 20:43.827
He shouldn't have brought
his ass out here.

20:43.827 --> 20:45.413
- Barry!
- No.

20:45.413 --> 20:48.137
- Stop being a child.
Barry!

20:56.275 --> 20:59.793
He's not out here.

20:59.793 --> 21:01.862
I know.

21:01.862 --> 21:05.379
- Why would you lie?
- Bye.

21:05.379 --> 21:07.103
Who's car is that?

21:07.103 --> 21:09.620
- It's my sister's, but that's
none of your business.

21:09.620 --> 21:14.344
- Sharon, what--
- Bye!

21:14.344 --> 21:16.551
Blew my high.

21:25.310 --> 21:27.896
What do you want?

21:30.241 --> 21:31.931
Hey.

21:34.275 --> 21:36.965
- You remember me?
- Yes.

21:36.965 --> 21:41.344
- Ah geez,
I thought you would.

21:41.344 --> 21:42.965
What do you want?

21:42.965 --> 21:47.931
- No, I just came to
check on you, you know?

21:47.931 --> 21:50.413
How are you?

21:50.413 --> 21:55.724
- Not good,
I was shot.

21:55.724 --> 21:59.137
- But you lived, right?
Yeah.

21:59.137 --> 22:01.586
- Please leave.
- No.

22:01.586 --> 22:06.310
- Please.
- No, no, no, not yet.

22:06.310 --> 22:08.034
Why?

22:10.068 --> 22:13.482
Have you seen Kyle?

22:13.482 --> 22:14.965
No.

22:14.965 --> 22:19.482
- You sure?
- Yeah, I haven't.

22:19.482 --> 22:22.310
And you won't again?

22:22.310 --> 22:23.965
- Is that what this
is about?

22:23.965 --> 22:25.551
- What? You mean you getting
shot?

22:25.551 --> 22:29.000
Let me see.
It's cool dude, just...

22:29.000 --> 22:30.482
Yeah.

22:30.482 --> 22:34.068
- Yeah, yeah,
that's what this is about.

22:34.068 --> 22:39.103
- Why?
- Because you are disrespectful,

22:39.103 --> 22:40.689
you're cute, man,

22:40.689 --> 22:46.482
but you are disrespectful.

22:46.482 --> 22:48.310
Hmm?

22:48.310 --> 22:50.068
I'm sorry.

22:50.068 --> 22:52.551
- You know that guy that
shot you with the cute face

22:52.551 --> 22:55.517
and the nice, uh--

22:55.517 --> 22:56.724
you're not into that
kind of thing?

22:56.724 --> 22:59.862
Okay, yeah, well,
he'll be back.

22:59.862 --> 23:02.724
- No, please--
- If, if, if--

23:02.724 --> 23:04.068
- What?
- If--

23:04.068 --> 23:06.034
- What?
- You go near Kyle again.

23:06.034 --> 23:08.413
- I won't.
- Yeah, you sure?

23:08.413 --> 23:10.413
Yes.

23:10.413 --> 23:11.586
- You know, if I
wanted you dead,

23:11.586 --> 23:13.241
you'd be dead, right?

23:13.241 --> 23:14.517
Yes.

23:14.517 --> 23:17.655
I mean, that was pretty scary.

23:17.655 --> 23:19.862
Huh?
Yeah, I know it was.

23:19.862 --> 23:23.689
But you know what?
Hey, I let you live. Hm?

23:23.689 --> 23:29.000
I mean, Dale, you could say "I'm
sorry," now.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.310
I'm sorry.

23:30.310 --> 23:31.620
- Man, were you raised
by wolves or something?

23:31.620 --> 23:33.758
You can say "thank you."

23:33.758 --> 23:35.517
- Thank you.
- For what?

23:35.517 --> 23:37.758
What? What? What? Huh? Huh?

23:37.758 --> 23:39.655
- For letting me live.
- That's right!

23:39.655 --> 23:43.379
I let you live!
And do you know why? Hm?

23:43.379 --> 23:44.827
- Why?
- Because when you get

23:44.827 --> 23:46.758
all healed up,
you're gonna want to go

23:46.758 --> 23:49.379
- and see him again.
- No.

23:49.379 --> 23:50.551
- Yes, you will.
- No, I won't.

23:50.551 --> 23:52.000
Yes, yes, yes, you will,

23:52.000 --> 23:53.896
stop it, yes you will.
But you see, I want you

23:53.896 --> 23:56.206
to remember this little lesson
with the half shell

23:56.206 --> 24:00.413
that missed all your little
cute, bloody organs.

24:00.413 --> 24:04.862
Next time,
not so lucky.

24:08.620 --> 24:11.586
Alright.
I know you need to rest up,

24:11.586 --> 24:14.551
you take care, okay?
Alright.

24:14.551 --> 24:19.000
That's right. Yeah.
Ooh!

24:27.310 --> 24:29.241
What's wrong?

24:29.241 --> 24:31.586
Nothing.

24:31.586 --> 24:34.965
You've been acting strange.

24:34.965 --> 24:36.758
- You gonna come
by my place?

24:36.758 --> 24:38.482
I told you, yes.

24:38.482 --> 24:43.655
- Okay. As soon as you can.
- As soon as I can.

24:43.655 --> 24:46.896
Thanks.

24:46.896 --> 24:49.310
- Why you acting
so strange?

24:49.310 --> 24:54.413
- Okay, I just--
- Are you acting strange?

24:54.413 --> 24:58.206
- First lady.
- No, no, don't get up.

24:58.206 --> 25:00.482
Ma'am, I have to go.

25:00.482 --> 25:03.931
- You do that.
- Yes, ma'am.

25:03.931 --> 25:08.172
- And close the door.
- Yes, ma'am.

25:12.862 --> 25:18.137
- Well, this looks good.
She cook for you?

25:18.137 --> 25:19.551
No.

25:19.551 --> 25:22.931
- Damn, the bitch don't
even cook?

25:22.931 --> 25:24.758
- I should be heading
back to work.

25:24.758 --> 25:27.379
Yes, you should.

25:27.379 --> 25:29.931
Working on
beating her ass.

25:29.931 --> 25:31.655
- Okay, ma'am,
we've been through this.

25:31.655 --> 25:35.827
Yes, yes we have.

25:35.827 --> 25:38.034
- If you send someone
back to my house--

25:38.034 --> 25:42.965
- Oh, what are you
gonna do?

25:42.965 --> 25:45.793
- Do you think I'm
scared of you?

25:45.793 --> 25:47.965
Are you?

25:47.965 --> 25:52.586
- No. I'm not scared of you
or your husband.

25:52.586 --> 25:54.068
Mm.

25:54.068 --> 25:57.724
Well, he's right there
in the Oval.

25:57.724 --> 25:59.379
Why don't you go
beat his ass?

25:59.379 --> 26:02.931
- Oh, I would love to, ma'am,
really,

26:02.931 --> 26:05.413
I would really enjoy that,
but you and I both know

26:05.413 --> 26:09.034
- that that can't happen.
- And why not?

26:09.034 --> 26:13.241
- Do you see all the
Secret Service around here?

26:13.241 --> 26:16.896
- If they weren't,
would you do it?

26:16.896 --> 26:19.344
- Of course not, ma'am,
no, I would never

26:19.344 --> 26:23.793
put my hands on the president
of the United States.

26:23.793 --> 26:26.965
- Come on, honey,
you're not being recorded.

26:26.965 --> 26:30.896
- I should get going.
- You're cute.

26:30.896 --> 26:34.655
- Ma'am--
- Maybe I should -- you

26:34.655 --> 26:37.379
before I let them
hurt you too bad.

26:37.379 --> 26:40.586
Ma'am, please.

26:40.586 --> 26:45.862
- Oh.
Wait, is--is that it?

26:45.862 --> 26:51.931
Oh honey, no wonder
she's not satisfied.

26:51.931 --> 26:54.896
You and Hunter are from
the same family.

26:54.896 --> 26:57.379
That's not good.

26:57.379 --> 26:59.689
- Ma'am, I got--
I have to go, okay?

26:59.689 --> 27:03.103
Oh, are you embarrassed?

27:03.103 --> 27:05.965
- Ma'am, please,
I have to go, okay?

27:05.965 --> 27:08.551
You do that.

27:10.275 --> 27:14.965
- And, ma'am, just so you know,
some men are growers.

27:14.965 --> 27:19.034
- You are embarrassed.
Show me!

27:19.034 --> 27:21.586
Show me, honey!

27:33.379 --> 27:36.000
- Good morning.
- Hey.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.206
How are you?

27:38.206 --> 27:41.379
- I'm good.
- Good.

27:41.379 --> 27:42.724
You look rested.

27:42.724 --> 27:45.068
- You know, I feel great,
thank you.

27:45.068 --> 27:48.758
Okay. Good.

27:48.758 --> 27:52.379
Am I cleared?

27:52.379 --> 27:54.137
Yes, yeah.

27:54.137 --> 27:56.137
- Okay.
- Okay.

27:59.586 --> 28:02.034
What's wrong with you?

28:02.034 --> 28:06.517
- Nothing.
- What is it?

28:06.517 --> 28:09.551
- I was in the break room
with Allan, and...

28:09.551 --> 28:11.000
And what?

28:13.620 --> 28:15.241
Nothing, nothing.

28:17.068 --> 28:18.482
Tell me.

28:20.758 --> 28:27.379
- The first lady came in and
he was acting really strange.

28:27.379 --> 28:29.551
Strange how?

28:32.896 --> 28:34.862
- Look, can I just call
you out of here

28:34.862 --> 28:37.000
so we can talk?

28:37.000 --> 28:40.758
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

28:40.758 --> 28:42.137
- Let me know when
you're ready.

28:42.137 --> 28:44.931
- Okay, okay.
- All right.

28:44.931 --> 28:46.724
Good.

28:46.724 --> 28:48.965
- Samuel.
- Priscilla.

28:48.965 --> 28:51.241
- How are you?
- I'm good.

28:51.241 --> 28:53.965
- Good.
- How are you?

28:53.965 --> 28:57.379
- Oh, I'm great.
- That's good.

28:57.379 --> 28:59.241
- I'd be much better if
you moved out of my way

28:59.241 --> 29:01.068
so that I could get
to work.

29:01.068 --> 29:03.896
- Well, Priscilla,
I think that, uh...

29:03.896 --> 29:05.827
What?

29:05.827 --> 29:07.413
- I don't think that
you should--

29:07.413 --> 29:10.068
- Look, if you're not
going to do your job

29:10.068 --> 29:13.862
to stop me,
then move.

29:13.862 --> 29:15.482
What are you here for?

29:15.482 --> 29:17.931
- To do my job,
sweetheart.

29:17.931 --> 29:19.724
- And what job is that,
Priscilla?

29:19.724 --> 29:23.793
- Oh, I see the first thing
I'm here to take care of.

29:23.793 --> 29:27.344
- Priscilla--
- Excuse me. Sam.

29:34.689 --> 29:37.275
Ma'am?

29:37.275 --> 29:41.793
- Priscilla.
- How are you?

29:44.103 --> 29:48.482
Oh, I take it that means
you're doing well?

29:51.586 --> 29:54.137
Sam, are you gonna follow
me around the White House

29:54.137 --> 29:56.724
- all day today?
- If I have to.

29:56.724 --> 29:59.379
- Oh great, I hope you
have your running shoes on.

29:59.379 --> 30:02.931
- Good.
- Okay, great.

30:02.931 --> 30:04.965
I need to talk to you.

30:04.965 --> 30:07.275
- What do you want to
talk to me about?

30:07.275 --> 30:10.586
- I need to talk to you
in private now, Priscilla.

30:10.586 --> 30:12.896
Okay!

30:12.896 --> 30:15.448
- This way.
- Fine.

30:17.517 --> 30:20.034
- I'd like to talk to you
in the residence.

30:20.034 --> 30:23.758
- Well, ma'am, I was--
- No no, her, alone.

30:23.758 --> 30:25.896
- Yes, ma'am.
- Ma'am?

30:25.896 --> 30:30.103
- Sam.
I'm not asking.

30:30.103 --> 30:34.241
- Yes, ma'am.
- The yellow room, please.

30:34.241 --> 30:40.344
- Ah.
The yellow room.

30:56.896 --> 30:58.310
Hey.

30:58.310 --> 31:00.000
Hey.

31:00.000 --> 31:04.379
- I--I kept your food warm.
- Okay.

31:08.758 --> 31:11.344
Thank you.

31:11.344 --> 31:14.793
Let me get it for you.

31:14.793 --> 31:17.551
- You know, I gotta
be back to work in a bit.

31:17.551 --> 31:21.206
- Oh, I know you're tired.
- I am even more tired now.

31:21.206 --> 31:25.000
- Ooh, Mama tried.
- You know what?

31:26.931 --> 31:29.000
- Can y'all stop with that
lovey dovey shit, please?

31:29.000 --> 31:30.620
- Whoa, hey, hey,
watch your mouth.

31:30.620 --> 31:33.862
- I'm just saying, it's a lot.
It's a lot.

31:33.862 --> 31:35.655
What's wrong with you?

31:35.655 --> 31:38.068
- I was traumatized walking
in on y'all having sex,

31:38.068 --> 31:40.620
- and y'all still--
- Boy, go somewhere.

31:40.620 --> 31:42.482
- Yeah, 'cause we about
to do it again.

31:42.482 --> 31:44.172
- Come on, baby.

31:44.172 --> 31:47.103
- No, no, stop, stop!
Dad. Stop.

31:47.103 --> 31:48.137
- What--what is it?

31:48.137 --> 31:49.551
I need to talk to you.

31:49.551 --> 31:51.206
Talk.

31:51.206 --> 31:56.586
- Look, when I was at the
boutique with Ruth's sister,

31:56.586 --> 32:00.000
I saw her leave for
the White House.

32:00.000 --> 32:03.862
She never came back.

32:03.862 --> 32:05.448
What do you mean?

32:05.448 --> 32:07.172
What you mean you saw her leave
for the White House?

32:07.172 --> 32:09.379
- I saw that dude on the news
that got shot,

32:09.379 --> 32:11.724
Secret Service agent.

32:11.724 --> 32:13.103
Max?

32:13.103 --> 32:14.896
- Yeah.
And when I saw his picture,

32:14.896 --> 32:18.137
I remembered that it was him
that she left with.

32:18.137 --> 32:20.586
What happened?

32:20.586 --> 32:24.620
- She ended up missing, and then
they both ended up shot.

32:24.620 --> 32:28.965
- Yeah, she was in an affair
with both of them.

32:28.965 --> 32:30.620
How do you know that?

32:30.620 --> 32:34.034
- That's what they said
on the TV.

32:34.034 --> 32:39.034
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

32:39.034 --> 32:41.965
- I--I knew them.

32:41.965 --> 32:45.344
I don't think that's right.

32:45.344 --> 32:47.655
- What do you think's
going on?

32:47.655 --> 32:49.551
- That's what I'm trying
to figure out.

32:49.551 --> 32:51.448
- Look, it's like I told
you before,

32:51.448 --> 32:55.103
don't talk to anyone about this
until I get some information.

32:55.103 --> 32:56.758
- Dad, you said that
a while ago.

32:56.758 --> 33:00.000
- Look, I know, okay,
I just gotta go talk to Sam.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.862
Alright.

33:01.862 --> 33:04.482
But I can tell you this:

33:04.482 --> 33:08.000
something ain't right
about this.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.965
Lord, what's going on?

33:10.965 --> 33:15.586
- Baby.
It'll be alright.

33:15.586 --> 33:17.172
- Okay, well, let me get
your food.

33:17.172 --> 33:19.275
Okay.

33:27.137 --> 33:30.310
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:30.310 --> 33:33.310
- How you feeling?
- I'm fine.

33:33.310 --> 33:35.862
You get any sleep?

33:35.862 --> 33:37.965
Yeah, I got a little.

33:39.241 --> 33:42.758
- Well, that's good.
- Mm-hmm.

33:42.758 --> 33:44.448
Alright well, I'm gonna go ahead
and--

33:44.448 --> 33:48.379
I was worried about you.

33:48.379 --> 33:50.758
Should've stayed with me
last night.

33:50.758 --> 33:53.310
I didn't want to.

33:53.310 --> 33:57.724
- Okay.
Where did you stay?

33:57.724 --> 33:59.655
With Barry.

33:59.655 --> 34:01.793
- Why are you playing with me?
No, you did not.

34:01.793 --> 34:04.620
- How do you know that?
- I know that you didn't.

34:04.620 --> 34:06.551
- Why are you asking me
all these questions?

34:06.551 --> 34:08.034
- I can't be concerned
for what's going on

34:08.034 --> 34:10.000
in my woman's life?

34:10.000 --> 34:12.344
- Okay, well just know that
I don't have to--

34:15.413 --> 34:17.931
- Well, is that
him calling?

34:17.931 --> 34:21.344
- No, um...
- What?

34:21.344 --> 34:23.620
It's the White House.

34:23.620 --> 34:25.482
- Sharon, I don't understand
that at all.

34:25.482 --> 34:27.137
I don't either.

34:27.137 --> 34:28.793
- If that's the president
calling, you can't answer it.

34:28.793 --> 34:30.482
I know.

34:30.482 --> 34:32.275
Well, then don't.

34:32.275 --> 34:33.586
You don't tell me what to do.

34:33.586 --> 34:36.620
- No, I just tell you--
- Shut up.

34:36.620 --> 34:38.103
Hello?

34:38.103 --> 34:42.034
- Hey there.
It's the president.

34:42.034 --> 34:43.827
Hi.

34:43.827 --> 34:48.275
- So I'd love for you to come
to the White House for a tour.

34:48.275 --> 34:51.103
- Um, at your--your--
- Yes.

34:51.103 --> 34:54.827
Don't you want to see
these long halls of history?

34:54.827 --> 34:58.344
- No.
- Um...

34:58.344 --> 35:00.827
What?

35:00.827 --> 35:03.137
- You know what?
Yeah. That'll be great.

35:03.137 --> 35:04.275
Sharon.

35:04.275 --> 35:05.793
Good.

35:05.793 --> 35:10.137
- But actually,
I've already had a tour, so.

35:10.137 --> 35:13.000
- You have?
- Yes.

35:13.000 --> 35:16.172
- By who?
- The head butler, Richard.

35:16.172 --> 35:18.206
He's like an uncle to me.

35:18.206 --> 35:21.379
- Yeah well he--
he can't give you

35:21.379 --> 35:24.137
anywhere near the tour
that I can.

35:24.137 --> 35:27.517
- Sharon.
- I see.

35:27.517 --> 35:29.758
So you want to come?

35:29.758 --> 35:32.000
- Can I--
- Invite your boyfriend.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.551
- Invite your boyfriend.
- Can I bring my boyfriend?

35:33.551 --> 35:36.068
- Boyfriend?
- Yeah.

35:36.068 --> 35:40.931
- Well, um, I was hoping this
was a private tour.

35:40.931 --> 35:44.827
- I would really love for
him to see it too.

35:44.827 --> 35:47.931
- Sure, that's fine.
- Okay.

35:47.931 --> 35:49.206
No.

35:49.206 --> 35:51.517
- When do you want
to come?

35:51.517 --> 35:54.758
- Can I call you back
and let you know?

35:54.758 --> 35:57.379
- I'm the president, how
you gonna do that?

35:57.379 --> 35:59.344
Right, yeah.

35:59.344 --> 36:01.586
- Tell you what,
I'll--I'll call you back,

36:01.586 --> 36:05.275
but when I do,
you gotta have an answer.

36:05.275 --> 36:06.931
Okay.

36:06.931 --> 36:09.758
- And just so you know,
some of the things

36:09.758 --> 36:14.275
I wanted to show you
are top secret.

36:14.275 --> 36:16.275
I don't think your boyfriend's
going to be able to go

36:16.275 --> 36:20.172
all the places
I want to take you.

36:20.172 --> 36:22.172
I see.

36:22.172 --> 36:24.034
I'll call you back.

36:24.034 --> 36:26.793
Bye.

36:26.793 --> 36:30.034
- Sharon, that is crazy.
- I know.

36:30.034 --> 36:34.034
- He's a presidential predator.
- I feel that.

36:34.034 --> 36:36.137
- You can't go.
- I don't want to.

36:36.137 --> 36:38.551
- Then don't.
- Kareem--

36:38.551 --> 36:40.586
- No, no, no, no,
and if he calls you again,

36:40.586 --> 36:42.241
you have to ignore it.

36:42.241 --> 36:44.103
In fact, block the number.
Give me your phone, Sharon.

36:44.103 --> 36:47.758
- I'm a grown ass woman,
I can handle myself.

36:47.758 --> 36:49.206
I'm trying to protect you.

36:49.206 --> 36:50.758
- Well go protect me by
getting back to work.

36:50.758 --> 36:53.551
He's dangerous, Sharon.

36:53.551 --> 36:55.724
I will, but you heard me, yeah?

36:55.724 --> 37:00.206
- I'm not a puppy, Kareem.
Go back to work.

37:00.206 --> 37:03.206
- Thought I was the boss here,
what's happening?

37:16.344 --> 37:18.379
Hello.

37:18.379 --> 37:22.379
- Sir.
- You still up here?

37:22.379 --> 37:24.517
Yes I am, sir.

37:24.517 --> 37:27.586
Oh, still with the "sir," huh?

37:27.586 --> 37:29.310
- What can I do
for you, sir?

37:29.310 --> 37:32.827
- Kyle, you know what you
can do for me, right?

37:32.827 --> 37:34.689
- That's not very
professional, sir.

37:34.689 --> 37:36.448
- Damn, are we still
on that?

37:36.448 --> 37:38.586
Yes we are, sir.

37:38.586 --> 37:40.034
Are you really that upset

37:40.034 --> 37:43.931
about the little
pharmacy -- ? Huh?

37:43.931 --> 37:45.620
You don't even know him, Kyle, I
mean--

37:45.620 --> 37:47.448
- You don't even know him,
Donald.

37:47.448 --> 37:49.551
- Oh, and you do?
- Yes I do.

37:49.551 --> 37:52.172
- What's his address? Hm?
What's his Momma's name?

37:52.172 --> 37:55.620
What's his Daddy's name?
Does he have a cat? Dog? Hm?

37:55.620 --> 37:57.827
- You damn well know
that doesn't matter.

37:57.827 --> 38:00.310
Then you don't know him, Kyle.

38:00.310 --> 38:03.448
No, what matters is how
good that ass was, huh, Kyle?

38:03.448 --> 38:04.896
Yeah.

38:04.896 --> 38:06.482
- Yeah, that's a little
more important.

38:06.482 --> 38:08.310
- Alright. You know I'm not
gonna tolerate this from you,

38:08.310 --> 38:10.068
right, Kyle?

38:10.068 --> 38:13.517
Yeah, that's very clear, sir.

38:13.517 --> 38:15.344
Let me ask you something, sir.

38:15.344 --> 38:18.103
What is it, sir? Hm?

38:18.103 --> 38:21.724
- Every time I screw around
are you gonna kill them all?

38:21.724 --> 38:24.551
Just the ones I know about.

38:24.551 --> 38:27.482
- Yeah, I guess there would
be a lot more dead guys then.

38:27.482 --> 38:30.103
- Well that one's still alive,
right?

38:30.103 --> 38:32.517
You must have said a special
prayer for him.

38:32.517 --> 38:35.689
- Yeah, I sure did.
- Yeah.

38:35.689 --> 38:38.896
- Next time...
- And if I'm being honest--

38:38.896 --> 38:40.896
- Yeah?
- I sort of wish

38:40.896 --> 38:44.586
it was you in that bed.
The hospital bed.

38:44.586 --> 38:47.275
Yeah?

38:47.275 --> 38:49.275
You broke my heart.

38:53.724 --> 38:57.206
- You know this shit
is sexy, right?

38:57.206 --> 38:59.758
I don't think so.

38:59.758 --> 39:02.862
You lie, you like it.

39:02.862 --> 39:06.206
Say you like it. Huh?

39:06.206 --> 39:10.034
Yeah, you getting turned
on right now, huh?

39:10.034 --> 39:12.655
Are you blushing, Kyle?
Are you blushing?

39:12.655 --> 39:14.724
What can I do for you, sir?

39:14.724 --> 39:17.586
- I just thought he'd be moving
around by now.

39:17.586 --> 39:21.379
I was just surprised to see
that you're still up here. Hm?

39:21.379 --> 39:27.310
- Where else would I go?
I'm under command to be here.

39:27.310 --> 39:28.793
Okay.

39:28.793 --> 39:32.827
- How long you gonna leave me on
this detail?

39:32.827 --> 39:36.206
Until you learn your lesson.

39:36.206 --> 39:40.034
- I'm the only one you
- - with, you understand?

39:40.034 --> 39:44.000
- I just wish it was
a little more often.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.862
Damn.

39:45.862 --> 39:47.241
Well we can make that happen,
you know,

39:47.241 --> 39:49.551
my office is downstairs.

39:49.551 --> 39:50.931
Let's go.

39:50.931 --> 39:54.241
- No.
'Cause you?

39:54.241 --> 39:57.758
You're on guard, hmm.

39:57.758 --> 40:01.172
All talk.

40:01.172 --> 40:04.862
Well, since I'm up here,
you need to know

40:04.862 --> 40:08.896
that the president is with
the press secretary.

40:08.896 --> 40:11.620
Is that why you wanted me
here, Donald?

40:11.620 --> 40:13.689
- No, no--

40:13.689 --> 40:16.137
- Yeah, mm-hmm, yeah,
that's what it is.

40:16.137 --> 40:18.965
- What are you even talking
about? Hm?

40:18.965 --> 40:22.344
- So that he wouldn't follow
them.

40:22.344 --> 40:26.344
Kyle, no.

40:26.344 --> 40:29.724
- We both know that he likes
to creep about.

40:29.724 --> 40:31.586
- Oh yeah, no,
he's a creeper,

40:31.586 --> 40:35.896
you're right about that,
yeah.

40:35.896 --> 40:38.034
- Why didn't you just get a
lower level agent

40:38.034 --> 40:41.137
to handle this, Donald?
Why is this necessary?

40:41.137 --> 40:44.724
- Then I wouldn't have known
where you were.

40:44.724 --> 40:47.034
- And why is that so important
all the sudden?

40:47.034 --> 40:49.655
- Well, you know...
- Oh yeah, you thought

40:49.655 --> 40:51.620
that I was at the hospital,
didn't you?

40:51.620 --> 40:53.758
- No, no, no, no, no,
I knew you weren't

40:53.758 --> 40:55.517
- at the hospital.
- And how would you know that?

40:55.517 --> 40:59.000
'Cause I was at the hospital.

41:00.965 --> 41:02.724
You went to see him?

41:02.724 --> 41:06.241
- Yeah, man, and he was scared--
- Why, why?

41:06.241 --> 41:07.862
- --to death,
you should've seen this guy.

41:07.862 --> 41:09.448
Why, why did you do that?

41:09.448 --> 41:12.413
- I thought you'd like--
- Hasn't he experienced enough?

41:12.413 --> 41:15.655
Hell no.

41:15.655 --> 41:17.827
You think that was enough?

41:17.827 --> 41:20.724
See him again and what happens?
Huh?

41:20.724 --> 41:22.758
Yeah.

41:22.758 --> 41:24.931
- I told you that was a warning,
right?

41:24.931 --> 41:26.241
- You know this is not helping
your case--

41:27.724 --> 41:29.241
- No, no, no,
do not try change the--

41:29.241 --> 41:32.068
- Wait, wait, what was that,
what was that?

41:32.068 --> 41:34.724
- No, Kyle, kick down the door.

41:34.724 --> 41:36.206
Open the door
right now, right now!

41:37.379 --> 41:38.724
- No! No! No!
No, no, no, no!

41:38.724 --> 41:41.517
- Get him, get him,
get him!

41:41.517 --> 41:43.551
- Jason!

41:43.551 --> 41:44.758
- Don't pull it, Kyle.
- Help me!

41:44.758 --> 41:48.758
- It's okay.

41:48.758 --> 41:50.344
- Next on
"The Oval"--

41:50.344 --> 41:52.620
- I can have everything I want
to know beaten out of you.

41:52.620 --> 41:55.931
- Well, if you wish, ma'am,
you should absolutely try.

41:55.931 --> 41:58.206
- Yes, sir, it's your son.
- What'd he do now?

41:58.206 --> 42:00.862
- What are you doing here?
- He came to see me.

42:00.862 --> 42:02.310
The guy from the White House.

42:02.310 --> 42:04.000
- I'm the -- President
of the United States,

42:04.000 --> 42:05.793
she's ignoring me.

42:05.793 --> 42:07.206
Find that girl
and bring her to me.

42:07.206 --> 42:08.758
- Why did you
bring me here?

42:08.758 --> 42:11.448
What do you want
from me!?

42:13.655 --> 42:15.931
Hi, Sharon.

42:15.931 --> 42:17.517
What the hell?
