00:01.080 --> 00:04.218
<i>Previously
on "Transformers Prime"...</i>

00:04.219 --> 00:08.589
A crash landing,
buried here for centuries.

00:08.590 --> 00:11.024
These Autobots
didn't perish in the crash.

00:11.025 --> 00:13.794
They're displaying the effects
of a virus.

00:15.396 --> 00:17.464
If a cure exists,

00:17.465 --> 00:19.266
Megatron may be
the only one who knows it.

00:19.267 --> 00:22.202
You must enter his brain
and find it.

00:27.141 --> 00:29.710
What are you doing
inside my head?!

00:31.145 --> 00:34.481
We have the formula.
Disconnect Bumblebee now!

00:35.950 --> 00:39.820
No! Take me-e-e-e!

00:39.821 --> 00:41.455
I'm out.

00:48.029 --> 00:49.897
Follow the light.

00:49.898 --> 00:51.965
Good. Good.

00:51.966 --> 00:54.735
I wouldn't advice anything
strenuous, Optimus,

00:54.736 --> 00:57.504
but it appears that your systems
have fully recovered

00:57.505 --> 00:59.239
from the Cybonic plague.

01:02.110 --> 01:06.113
Thanks to your
medical expertise, old friend.

01:06.114 --> 01:09.249
It was your scout
who braved unknown territory

01:09.250 --> 01:10.751
to locate the cure.

01:12.687 --> 01:14.855
Lucky for us,
Megatron was still alive.

01:16.124 --> 01:17.724
Yeah, I actually said that.

01:17.725 --> 01:21.461
What matters is that you are
on the mend, Optimus,

01:21.462 --> 01:23.497
while Megatron --

01:25.733 --> 01:27.000
He's right.

01:27.001 --> 01:29.803
Did my best
to finish Megatron's story.

01:29.804 --> 01:32.506
Just couldn't stick around
long enough to see how it ended.

01:36.144 --> 01:39.579
It is a matter of time
before Optimus discovers

01:39.580 --> 01:42.115
all is not right with you,
scout.

01:42.116 --> 01:45.552
I must reclaim my body,

01:45.553 --> 01:52.025
which means taking complete
and total control of yours.

Basketball by way of Cybertron.

02:42.002 --> 02:43.903
Let the games begin.

02:52.112 --> 02:53.579
Yeah! Go, bulk!

02:55.582 --> 02:58.517
Come on.
Best two out of three.

03:01.788 --> 03:04.056
Bee, you're in the clear!

03:04.991 --> 03:07.593
Dunk it, bee!

03:14.334 --> 03:17.269
Bumblebee,
quit hogging the ball.

03:22.709 --> 03:24.977
Eh, flagrant foul!

03:24.978 --> 03:27.279
Dodge ball by way of Cybertron.

03:27.280 --> 03:29.515
Bee, hoop's over there.

03:31.518 --> 03:33.486
Bee? You okay?

03:36.022 --> 03:38.591
Yeah.
Uh, three out of five.

03:44.130 --> 03:47.733
If I am to return to my body,

03:47.734 --> 03:51.504
I must first restore
its functionality.

03:51.505 --> 03:55.174
How did I escape
on high emission?

04:00.180 --> 04:01.981
Of course.

04:01.982 --> 04:04.183
Dark Energon.

04:08.421 --> 04:11.957
Starscream.

04:16.663 --> 04:19.398
Knock, knock.

04:19.399 --> 04:21.634
Is anyone in there?

04:21.635 --> 04:23.235
No? Oh, well.

04:23.236 --> 04:25.838
Seems I possess the only thing

04:25.839 --> 04:29.542
that would allow you to rise
off that slab and walk again,

04:29.543 --> 04:32.278
my dearest Megatron.

04:32.279 --> 04:35.114
The only scrap left
on this planet,

04:35.115 --> 04:37.850
plucked from
your very spark chamber.

04:37.851 --> 04:42.454
But it cannot restore
your mind.

04:42.455 --> 04:48.460
The Decepticons need a leader,
not a decorative centerpiece.

04:48.461 --> 04:51.230
And I will convince them

04:51.231 --> 04:54.967
that I am the true heir
to your throne

04:54.968 --> 04:58.070
with a plan so epic --

04:58.071 --> 05:01.907
Not even the mighty Megatron
could have conceived it?

05:06.713 --> 05:09.148
That was the idea, knockout.

05:09.149 --> 05:11.050
How long have you been there?

05:11.051 --> 05:12.952
Long enough.

05:12.953 --> 05:14.753
And it's
"commander knockout" to you,

05:14.754 --> 05:18.190
once and future lord
Starscream.

05:29.736 --> 05:32.004
Raf?
Class is starting.

05:32.005 --> 05:34.106
Bumblebee never picked me up
for school,

05:34.107 --> 05:35.941
and his comlink's off again.

05:35.942 --> 05:37.209
Any idea where he is?

05:48.989 --> 05:52.958
Yes, go on, scout.

05:52.959 --> 05:55.594
Obey my will.

05:57.998 --> 05:59.932
Bumblebee!

06:02.168 --> 06:04.003
I needed that!

06:05.739 --> 06:08.374
What has gotten into you?

06:11.678 --> 06:14.279
You're seeing Megatron's face?

06:16.282 --> 06:19.852
Bumblebee's complaining
of intermittent visions --

06:19.853 --> 06:21.954
Waking nightmares, if you will.

06:21.955 --> 06:24.657
But you said bee was fine
when you checked him over.

06:24.658 --> 06:26.925
Physically,
but the experience he endured

06:26.926 --> 06:29.662
seems to be having a temporary
effect on his psyche.

06:29.663 --> 06:31.030
This induced power-down

06:31.031 --> 06:33.932
should force Bumblebee's mind
to rest and recover.

06:38.505 --> 06:39.905
<i>Prime...</i>

06:39.906 --> 06:43.208
<i>You spot any Decepticons
wearing hula skirts lately?</i>

06:43.209 --> 06:45.711
No, special agent Fowler.

06:45.712 --> 06:47.179
Why?

06:47.180 --> 06:49.481
<i>'Cause I was hoping you'd have
a lead on the 'cons</i>

06:49.482 --> 06:52.151
<i>that busted into
the kauai naval observatory.</i>

06:52.152 --> 06:53.719
<i>The place
looked like it was hit</i>

06:53.720 --> 06:54.987
<i>by an army of wrecking balls.</i>

06:54.988 --> 06:57.890
Why would 'cons break in
to an observatory?

06:57.891 --> 07:00.826
<i>Does the Hoit-Nikogosian
ring any bells?</i>

07:00.827 --> 07:02.194
The space telescope.

07:02.195 --> 07:05.197
<i>As of last night,
missing its primary lens.</i>

07:05.198 --> 07:07.966
It's difficult to guess
Starscream's intent

07:07.967 --> 07:10.703
without knowing
where the lens has been taken.

07:10.704 --> 07:13.405
<i>Good thing the lens
has a tracking device.</i>

07:16.776 --> 07:18.644
The Arctic?

07:18.645 --> 07:20.045
Great.

07:20.046 --> 07:23.015
Another chance
to freeze our spark plugs off.

07:24.117 --> 07:25.918
That's a nd-7 class.

07:25.919 --> 07:28.854
Biggest unminable
Energon deposit there is.

07:28.855 --> 07:33.525
Unminable until Starscream
melts his way down to it.

07:33.526 --> 07:35.294
With the help of the lens.

07:35.295 --> 07:37.096
Melting a glacier that size

07:37.097 --> 07:40.199
<i>would cause sea levels to rise
and demolish coastal cities.</i>

07:48.408 --> 07:54.379
Let the reign
of lord Starscream begin.

08:16.154 --> 08:18.088
So, I blow past
the finish line.

08:18.089 --> 08:19.289
Then my other sister Pilar

08:19.290 --> 08:21.224
asked how I got so good
at racing games.

08:21.225 --> 08:23.527
And I told her
I know a guy who knows cars.

08:23.528 --> 08:26.763
Rafael, I'm afraid
Bumblebee can't hear you

08:26.764 --> 08:28.765
in power-down mode.

08:28.766 --> 08:29.966
It's getting late.

08:29.967 --> 08:31.668
Why don't I bridge you home
to your family?

08:31.669 --> 08:34.738
Because I told bee I'd stay.
He's family, too.

08:34.739 --> 08:36.006
Don't be ridiculous.

08:36.006 --> 08:38.174
You're not even
the same species.

08:38.176 --> 08:41.544
That's being related.
It's not the same thing.

08:41.546 --> 08:43.947
I'll show you.

08:46.517 --> 08:49.419
This is my family.

08:49.420 --> 08:52.422
Mm-hmm.
It's very nice.

08:52.423 --> 08:54.391
<i>Very large.</i>

08:54.392 --> 08:56.393
Sometimes I can shout
and no one hears me.

08:56.394 --> 08:58.195
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

08:58.196 --> 09:01.264
But Bumblebee always listens.

09:03.868 --> 09:06.369
And I can understand him.

09:06.370 --> 09:10.540
I'm not sure why, but I do.

09:10.541 --> 09:14.211
A lot different
than our last polar visit.

09:14.212 --> 09:16.846
It feels like summer.

09:21.719 --> 09:24.654
Here, that's a bad thing.

09:32.096 --> 09:34.264
Autobots...

09:34.265 --> 09:38.201
Remember the end run
on Polyhex?

09:42.373 --> 09:45.442
Rafael,
I'm going to the supply vault

09:45.443 --> 09:47.711
to see if I can find parts
to repair this.

09:47.712 --> 09:49.879
You know what that means?

09:49.880 --> 09:52.048
Don't touch anything.

10:00.458 --> 10:02.692
Wait till you see
this new laptop

10:02.693 --> 10:04.127
I'm saving up for, bee.

10:05.796 --> 10:07.831
Bee?

10:07.832 --> 10:09.799
Bumblebee, wait!

10:17.642 --> 10:19.509
Bumblebee!

10:22.580 --> 10:23.947
What did you do?

10:23.948 --> 10:26.416
N-nothing!
Bumblebee just got up and --

10:26.417 --> 10:30.887
He was in power-down.
Where does he think he's off to?

10:35.359 --> 10:38.295
Where is it?
Where?!

11:06.490 --> 11:08.291
These are the coordinates

11:08.292 --> 11:11.461
for the site of our previous
battle with Megatron's undead.

11:11.462 --> 11:13.730
M-maybe
we should call Optimus.

11:13.731 --> 11:17.267
Optimus is busy preventing
a polar ice cap from melting.

11:17.268 --> 11:19.669
We need to handle this
on our own.

11:24.141 --> 11:25.542
Bumblebee?

11:25.543 --> 11:27.777
What have you been doing?

11:31.682 --> 11:33.383
Dark Energon?

11:36.554 --> 11:38.855
Bee, what are you doing?

11:43.894 --> 11:47.263
Bumblebee, please!
I know you're in there!

11:48.733 --> 11:51.501
You have to fight
whatever's making you do this!

12:00.478 --> 12:03.313
Ratchet, are you okay?

12:03.314 --> 12:05.081
I'm fine.

12:05.082 --> 12:07.050
More importantly, is Bumblebee?

12:07.051 --> 12:09.686
I fear the time spent
in Megatron's mindscape

12:09.687 --> 12:12.355
is causing him to think
like a Decepticon.

12:12.356 --> 12:13.857
Bee's not a 'con.

12:13.858 --> 12:15.058
Agreed.

12:15.059 --> 12:16.693
But we need to find out

12:16.694 --> 12:21.030
exactly what Bumblebee intends
to do with that shard.

12:21.031 --> 12:24.367
The only one who knew
of the dark Energon...

12:24.368 --> 12:26.569
Was Megatron.

12:26.570 --> 12:28.872
Bumblebee has
Megatron's memories?

12:28.873 --> 12:30.240
Worse.

12:30.241 --> 12:34.077
Megatron is occupying
Bumblebee's mind.

12:34.078 --> 12:35.612
What?!

12:35.613 --> 12:37.914
How could I have been
such a fool?

12:37.915 --> 12:41.518
The cortical psychic patch
acted a two-way conduit.

12:41.519 --> 12:44.287
When Bumblebee returned
to his own mind,

12:44.288 --> 12:45.588
Megatron followed.

12:45.589 --> 12:48.758
And now Bumblebee --
Megatron --

12:48.759 --> 12:52.695
Has bridged to nearly the same
coordinates Optimus used.

12:55.099 --> 12:58.034
Stay here.

12:58.035 --> 12:59.235
No!

12:59.236 --> 13:01.070
Bumblebee needs me.

13:03.574 --> 13:05.842
Of course he does.

13:10.481 --> 13:11.948
Yes!

13:11.949 --> 13:15.452
I love when a plan
comes together!

13:27.465 --> 13:29.432
Autobots.

13:29.433 --> 13:31.801
Please, lord Starscream,

13:31.802 --> 13:35.071
allow your second-in-command
the honor.

13:35.072 --> 13:37.841
Breakdown, total them!

14:11.008 --> 14:13.142
The Decepticon warship.

14:18.782 --> 14:20.483
Did Bumblebee do this?

14:20.484 --> 14:23.253
I fear Megatron's mind
is dominant,

14:23.254 --> 14:26.189
and clearly he came here
for one purpose --

14:26.190 --> 14:29.692
To use the dark Energon
to resurrect his own body.

14:29.693 --> 14:31.928
No!
Bumblebee won't let him,

14:31.929 --> 14:34.497
like he didn't let Megatron
hurt me back at the base.

14:34.498 --> 14:35.832
I hope you're right.

14:52.917 --> 14:55.184
Ratchet, don't hurt Bumblebee!

14:55.185 --> 14:57.487
That's not Bumblebee!

15:06.130 --> 15:07.730
Bumblebee, no!

15:07.731 --> 15:10.700
Remember who you are!
Remember me!

15:10.701 --> 15:12.936
I know you always listen to me,
no matter what.

15:16.941 --> 15:19.442
That's right, bee.
It's me.

15:21.612 --> 15:24.247
Unbelievable!

15:38.896 --> 15:41.397
Farewell, Megatron.

15:48.973 --> 15:50.173
Bumblebee!

15:58.048 --> 16:03.086
Bumblebee
can't hear you anymore!

16:03.087 --> 16:05.655
As much as I want you
to leave Bumblebee's body,

16:05.656 --> 16:08.391
I can't let you go back
to your own!

16:45.329 --> 16:47.363
Decepticons...

16:47.364 --> 16:50.867
Your rightful lord and master
has returned.

16:59.079 --> 17:03.182
Finish these pests!

17:03.183 --> 17:07.353
I have my own extermination
to perform.

18:02.142 --> 18:04.343
I'm gonna put you in ice!

18:11.418 --> 18:15.154
Don't the bots seem...
Understaffed?

18:19.726 --> 18:23.062
What good is a second-in-command
who fails to watch the rear?!

18:26.099 --> 18:28.134
Get out of my way!

18:43.116 --> 18:44.183
No!

19:00.233 --> 19:01.567
Optimus!

19:13.346 --> 19:15.981
Megatron's greatest mistake

19:15.982 --> 19:20.019
was ever allowing you to live,
prime!

19:25.759 --> 19:28.027
Megatron.

19:28.028 --> 19:29.461
He's back.

19:41.141 --> 19:44.043
Lord...Megatron.

19:44.044 --> 19:46.946
You...Are -- You're healed!

19:46.947 --> 19:50.883
Praise the Allspark.
It is a miracle!

19:50.884 --> 19:55.521
Oh, it will be a miracle
all right, Starscream,

19:55.522 --> 19:58.324
if you survive
what I have planned for you!

20:11.605 --> 20:14.506
But the autobots --
Optimus --

20:14.507 --> 20:17.209
Right there, waiting for you.

20:17.210 --> 20:19.845
My greatest mistake?

20:19.846 --> 20:21.847
I've made a few.

20:21.848 --> 20:25.584
But there is one I do not intend
to make again!

20:26.953 --> 20:29.421
No, master!

20:29.422 --> 20:32.024
No-o-o-o-o!

20:36.029 --> 20:39.965
Ratchet, we need a bridge.

20:39.966 --> 20:42.434
You are not the only ones.

20:56.383 --> 20:59.051
Everything's back to normal.
