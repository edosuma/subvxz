<i>The story of the American frontier
is a tale of conquest,</i>

00:10.779 --> 00:15.274
<i>but also one of survival,
persistence and the grit of the people.</i>

00:15.374 --> 00:18.947
<i>It's 20 years after a bloody Civil War.</i>

00:19.047 --> 00:22.914
<i>Despite Abraham Lincoln's
Emancipation Proclamation,</i>

00:23.014 --> 00:25.914
<i>slavery is alive and well
in the Wild West,</i>

00:26.014 --> 00:30.565
<i>in the form of prostitution,
the world's oldest profession.</i>

00:30.665 --> 00:33.925
<i>In Kansas and most
of the western territories,</i>

00:34.025 --> 00:38.382
<i>women are bought,
sold and traded like property.</i>

01:01.786 --> 01:03.388
Come on, Pa, show me how!

01:03.488 --> 01:07.425
All right, all right, now I'm gonna
do this one time, all right?

01:07.525 --> 01:11.897
Now the idea
is when the tyin's being done,

01:11.997 --> 01:14.685
you wanna flex your muscles.

01:16.368 --> 01:19.825
Blow your chest up like a rooster.

01:20.855 --> 01:23.389
What's a rooster do?

01:24.308 --> 01:27.145
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

01:27.245 --> 01:30.066
That's right, now you see,
when the tyin's done,

01:30.166 --> 01:34.937
you relax your muscles,
blow all the air outta your chest...

01:37.689 --> 01:40.876
and now look, the rope
gives ya just enough room

01:40.976 --> 01:43.598
so you can get yourself free.

01:44.263 --> 01:47.713
- Show me how, Pa. Show me how!
- Maybe after supper.

01:47.813 --> 01:51.884
- And your studies.
- The capital of Kansas is Topeka.

01:51.984 --> 01:55.940
And the President of the United States
is Chester Alvin Arthur.

01:56.040 --> 01:58.444
Chester Alan Arthur.

01:58.544 --> 02:01.846
Chester Alan Arthur.

02:06.351 --> 02:08.020
Can we ask him now, Ma?

02:08.120 --> 02:12.110
Before the day's activities
sour his disposition?

02:19.197 --> 02:22.134
What do you care about
some stupid old dance anyway?

02:22.234 --> 02:26.071
- You hush up!
- Do my eyes deceive me? Is that...

02:26.171 --> 02:29.342
Apple pie. I picked,
peeled and sliced all the apples.

02:29.442 --> 02:31.750
Then spiced them with cinnamon.

02:33.679 --> 02:37.732
Clay, Lily was invited to a tie dance,
over at the Tigman Ranch.

02:37.832 --> 02:41.670
You know, apple pie is my favorite.

02:41.770 --> 02:43.958
Spiced with cinnamon.

02:48.460 --> 02:51.929
The dance is the girls wear a calico dress

02:52.029 --> 02:55.367
and they bring a matching tie
for the boys to choose.

02:55.467 --> 02:59.037
Now I am familiar with the procedure

02:59.137 --> 03:02.073
of a tie dance, young lady.

03:02.173 --> 03:05.296
In fact, there was a time...

03:06.946 --> 03:10.216
It wasn't so long ago,
as a matter of fact...

03:10.316 --> 03:13.475
<i>Flies in the buttermilk, shoo, fly, shoo</i>

03:13.575 --> 03:17.217
<i>Flies in the buttermilk, shoo, fly, shoo</i>

03:17.317 --> 03:19.924
<i>Skip to my Lou, my darling</i>

03:20.024 --> 03:23.579
Flies in the buttermilk? Yuck!

03:24.228 --> 03:26.950
Well, Pa, can I go?

03:33.337 --> 03:35.740
I'm sorry, darling.

03:35.840 --> 03:39.684
- Maybe next year.
- But, Pa!

03:42.214 --> 03:45.551
- You know what this pie needs?
- My teeth?

03:45.651 --> 03:48.539
- Some honey.
- I'll fetch some.

04:12.478 --> 04:15.047
Well, last summer you let me
work at the Mercantile.

04:15.147 --> 04:18.986
Nellie Wilcott is 16
and she's been proposed to.

04:20.552 --> 04:22.053
Darling...

04:22.154 --> 04:25.123
Nellie Wilcott is not
my beautiful little girl.

04:25.223 --> 04:28.360
It's just a tie dance, Pa.

04:28.460 --> 04:32.631
Besides, if I ever do find a beau,
once he meets you,

04:32.731 --> 04:35.099
he'll be too scared
to ever call on me again.

04:35.199 --> 04:37.652
Darling, I'm sorry.

04:37.752 --> 04:42.095
Now this matter is settled.
I wanna have my dinner in peace.

04:47.045 --> 04:50.381
How long does it take that boy
to fetch some honey?

04:50.481 --> 04:52.804
I'll get him.

05:00.091 --> 05:02.660
They're gonna come calling, Clay.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.564
And we both know that extra year
is for you, not her.

05:05.664 --> 05:09.768
Amelia, you's the one what told me
what your dancing days led to.

05:09.868 --> 05:14.507
I was dancing at the Broken Spoke Saloon,
not the Tigman's front parlor.

05:14.607 --> 05:17.495
And I didn't have two loving parents.

05:19.043 --> 05:21.765
That's my little girl.

05:21.881 --> 05:26.404
If I ain't gonna protect her...
who's gonna?

05:43.134 --> 05:45.971
Ma! Pa!

05:46.071 --> 05:47.861
Lily?

05:50.109 --> 05:52.344
Oh, my God!

05:52.444 --> 05:54.432
Jake?

05:55.447 --> 05:59.070
Jake! What happened?

05:59.952 --> 06:02.039
Come here.

06:03.222 --> 06:06.008
Watch out, watch out!

09:11.510 --> 09:15.882
You can take comfort, Mr. Travis...

09:16.682 --> 09:21.745
in knowing that Jake
is in a much better place.

09:22.586 --> 09:24.890
All due respect Reverend,

09:24.990 --> 09:29.013
I'd rather have my boy
standing right here beside me.

09:30.094 --> 09:32.349
I am sorry for your loss.

09:53.786 --> 09:56.574
For the life of me...

09:57.521 --> 10:00.111
I just can't remember
the sound of his voice.

10:02.961 --> 10:06.677
I'd give anything to hear
his voice one more time.

10:08.533 --> 10:11.156
He was my little boy.

10:13.137 --> 10:14.959
He's an angel.

10:25.049 --> 10:27.337
Blame me.

10:27.953 --> 10:30.207
Just say it.

10:31.188 --> 10:33.978
I'm the one who asked for the honey.

10:37.862 --> 10:39.597
Blame me.

10:39.697 --> 10:43.068
- Amelia.
- Blame me! Come on!

10:43.168 --> 10:45.738
Blame me! Blame me!

10:45.838 --> 10:49.907
Blame me! Blame me, blame me, blame me!

10:50.007 --> 10:52.343
I need you to!

10:52.443 --> 10:55.731
Please blame me! Please?

11:15.701 --> 11:18.589
We're nearly outta firewood.

11:29.246 --> 11:31.748
I'll go chop some.

11:34.251 --> 11:36.488
Mama.

11:36.988 --> 11:40.144
I love you, it's gonna be okay.

12:35.614 --> 12:38.784
- Where are you off to?
- Going to the lake.

12:38.884 --> 12:42.888
I... need you to stay here
and help me with the canning.

12:42.988 --> 12:45.457
But, Ma, you never asked me
to help you before.

12:45.557 --> 12:49.627
I thought you said canning's the one job
you like to do all by yourself.

12:49.727 --> 12:53.431
- This time I want you helping me.
- I done all my chores, all my bookwork,

12:53.531 --> 12:56.267
I was really looking forward
to going to the lake.

12:56.367 --> 12:58.236
There's no telling who's out there.

12:58.336 --> 13:01.606
Last time I was out there,
it was just old man Hill.

13:01.706 --> 13:04.262
That was nearly a year ago and...

13:04.808 --> 13:07.630
just had to help him bait his hook.

13:08.179 --> 13:11.683
I also want your daddy
checking that boat for leaks.

13:11.783 --> 13:14.137
But, Ma, the boat is fine.

13:15.219 --> 13:18.340
You're staying here
and helping me can these tomatoes!

13:18.440 --> 13:20.992
Why are you being silly?

13:21.092 --> 13:23.227
Don't you dare call me names.

13:23.327 --> 13:25.148
Amelia.

13:28.667 --> 13:30.902
Isn't that just like you?

13:31.002 --> 13:33.390
Taking her side.

13:34.806 --> 13:40.277
Lily, darling, I want you to stay here
and help your mama with the canning.

13:40.377 --> 13:43.666
Just for today, this one time.

13:49.804 --> 13:53.876
Sweetie, I'm gonna go down
and check that boat for leaks.

13:54.226 --> 13:56.012
Okay?

13:58.463 --> 14:02.685
- Be a good girl.
- Don't be doing me any favors, Clay.

15:22.213 --> 15:25.602
Lily get up, you've slept long enough!

15:31.755 --> 15:33.610
Lily!

15:41.165 --> 15:43.054
Lily!

15:45.753 --> 15:48.945
Lily, your mama is calling you.

16:05.756 --> 16:08.559
Probably just in the privy or the barn.

16:08.659 --> 16:12.848
Not possible. I was awake before dawn.

16:36.553 --> 16:40.276
Lily's horse is missing,
I'm going over to Jane Thompson's.

17:24.236 --> 17:26.924
Can't find Lily nowhere.

17:27.771 --> 17:30.693
Took her horse and left
in the middle of the night.

17:32.677 --> 17:35.133
Jane Thompson.

17:36.248 --> 17:40.518
You tell Mrs. Travis
what her daughter confided in you.

17:40.818 --> 17:44.506
Or that matching blue bonnet
goes right back to Abilene!

18:02.907 --> 18:06.597
She's gone to Newton
to catch a stage to Wichita.

18:07.245 --> 18:10.381
She read an advertisement
about becoming a Harvey girl,

18:10.481 --> 18:13.337
waitress like Jane's sister.

18:19.356 --> 18:21.611
Thank you.

18:26.329 --> 18:29.252
I'd like a ticket to Wichita please.

18:31.802 --> 18:33.823
Just one?

18:34.806 --> 18:38.161
- Yes, sir.
- That'll be 50 cents.

18:41.078 --> 18:43.648
Visiting family, are ya?

18:44.077 --> 18:47.244
No, my family lives 'round these parts.

18:51.055 --> 18:52.490
Employment?

18:52.590 --> 18:56.780
Why yes, I'm hoping to get
a position as a Harvey girl.

18:58.061 --> 19:02.820
I've heard a lot of good things
about that outstanding company.

19:10.408 --> 19:13.710
- Coach leaves in 10 minutes.
- Thank you.

19:13.810 --> 19:15.819
Good luck with your...

19:15.919 --> 19:18.051
job hunting.

19:37.669 --> 19:40.234
- How do you do, ma'am?
- I'm well.

19:40.334 --> 19:44.342
- Name's Rig Marlowe.
- Lily Travis.

19:44.442 --> 19:48.399
Well, Lily like a flower.
Pleased to meet you.

19:50.347 --> 19:54.504
Has anyone told you that you look
like sunshine in the morning?

20:10.834 --> 20:13.623
You think you're gonna need that?

20:21.745 --> 20:24.716
Lily's horse, all cooled down.

20:24.816 --> 20:27.118
Limber and well-fed.

20:27.218 --> 20:29.587
You won't find a finer animal in town.

20:29.687 --> 20:32.175
Where's the owner?

20:34.258 --> 20:36.694
You're looking at him.

20:36.794 --> 20:39.317
That's my daughter's horse, where is she?

20:41.365 --> 20:45.710
I don't know. Fella gave me a dollar
to ride that horse back.

20:46.304 --> 20:48.473
Where did she go?

20:48.573 --> 20:50.642
I don't know.

20:50.742 --> 20:53.096
But I'm keeping that dollar.

21:07.025 --> 21:09.813
This girl been in here?

21:14.798 --> 21:16.834
What's she to you?

21:17.334 --> 21:19.482
She's our daughter.

21:23.140 --> 21:27.696
- The boy's a spitting image of you.
- We're looking for the girl.

21:28.346 --> 21:32.483
She has reddish-brown hair. Down to here.

21:32.583 --> 21:34.886
Reddish-brown you say?

21:34.986 --> 21:37.440
Have you seen her?

21:39.339 --> 21:43.177
- She don't look nothing like you.
- Have you seen the girl?

21:43.377 --> 21:45.499
Did she buy a ticket?

21:46.631 --> 21:48.351
No.

21:49.200 --> 21:51.569
Pretty little girl like that,

21:51.669 --> 21:53.905
that hair?

21:54.005 --> 21:56.173
I'd remember her.

21:56.273 --> 21:58.328
You son of a bitch.

21:59.309 --> 22:03.600
Clay. Clay, let's go, come on now.

22:13.790 --> 22:17.480
Maybe she changed her mind
and she's still in town?

22:20.998 --> 22:23.787
Fella in there is lying to you.

22:30.074 --> 22:34.511
I think it's time
you told me everything you know.

22:40.317 --> 22:44.221
She left a couple hours ago
on the stage to Wichita.

22:44.321 --> 22:47.710
Honest to God, or strike me dead.

22:50.928 --> 22:54.457
I'm going to get her.
You head back to the ranch.

22:54.998 --> 22:58.255
I'm not losing another child, Clay.

22:59.736 --> 23:02.674
Go to mercantile, get us some supplies.

23:02.774 --> 23:05.092
I'm gonna go in and deal with this fella.

23:05.442 --> 23:08.504
Be back here in five minutes.

23:09.046 --> 23:13.136
Clay, Lily told Jane
she ran off because of our...

23:14.619 --> 23:18.807
because of my ill temper and distress.

23:20.440 --> 23:22.851
Five minutes.

23:35.939 --> 23:38.209
Take your glasses off.

23:38.309 --> 23:39.343
Pardon me?

23:39.443 --> 23:42.265
Take your glasses off.

23:42.814 --> 23:45.267
You son of a bitch!

23:55.627 --> 23:57.613
Ma'am?

23:57.761 --> 24:02.474
That fella you were with,
he gave me a note to give ya.

24:05.136 --> 24:08.025
He said you'd give me two bits.

24:17.280 --> 24:19.335
Thank you, ma'am.

24:24.021 --> 24:27.258
<i>My darling Amelia, do not follow me.</i>

24:27.358 --> 24:31.061
<i>I'll find our daughter
and I'll bring her home safely.</i>

24:31.161 --> 24:33.750
<i>Love you always.</i>

24:38.035 --> 24:41.873
Your husband done this to me!
Crazy son of a bitch.

24:41.973 --> 24:45.994
He done this to me! Broke my damn nose!

26:09.527 --> 26:13.864
Excuse me, ma'am, would you happen to know
where they're hiring the Harvey girls?

26:13.964 --> 26:16.753
Thank you, thank you very much.

26:26.944 --> 26:30.870
I've been waiting in this line
for more than an hour, sir,

26:30.970 --> 26:33.869
I'd like to fill out my application.

26:34.384 --> 26:37.872
- Of course, miss, fill this out.
- Thank you.

26:39.189 --> 26:41.259
Excuse me, ladies.

26:41.359 --> 26:45.095
- You certain we met all our quotas?
- All the way to Colorado.

26:45.195 --> 26:48.501
Excuse me. I'm looking for my daughter.

26:49.367 --> 26:52.270
Her name's Lily Travis. Have you seen her?

26:52.370 --> 26:55.181
We'll have the remaining ladies
fill out applications

26:55.281 --> 27:00.263
then we'll inform them they'll get
a telegraph when employment is available.

27:01.111 --> 27:04.014
Sir, I need a second of your time.

27:04.114 --> 27:07.185
You see, that's my daughter.
Have you seen her?

27:07.285 --> 27:11.789
- Now take a look at the picture.
- Miss Eivers! Miss Eivers!

27:11.889 --> 27:14.226
Sir, please, please! Please!

27:14.326 --> 27:16.659
Ma'am, I have come
all the way from Newton,

27:16.759 --> 27:19.382
now I'm looking for my daughter.

27:21.799 --> 27:24.654
She's got reddish-brown hair.

27:25.937 --> 27:28.940
I'm sorry, your daughter hasn't been here.

27:29.040 --> 27:31.494
We haven't seen her.

27:42.119 --> 27:44.088
- Thank you.
- Next?

27:44.188 --> 27:47.710
Hi, yes, I'd like to fill out
an application for the Harvey girls.

27:57.100 --> 27:59.102
What's your name, boy?

27:59.802 --> 28:01.906
Jacob, Jacob Oliver.

28:02.006 --> 28:03.773
Jacob Oliver.

28:03.873 --> 28:08.779
Stage came in from Newton this morning,
I'm looking for a girl that was on it.

28:08.879 --> 28:11.615
- The driver here?
- No, sir.

28:11.715 --> 28:14.786
- Well, who switched the team?
- That'd be my pa.

28:14.886 --> 28:18.121
- Is he here?
- Asleep in the back.

28:18.421 --> 28:20.576
Well, come on, show me.

28:22.825 --> 28:25.148
Come on now.

28:25.463 --> 28:28.151
Show me where your dad is.

28:34.738 --> 28:38.128
You walk any slower,
you're going backwards.

28:40.243 --> 28:42.598
Mr. Oliver, listen to me now.

28:44.515 --> 28:48.971
This is her, you see that?
That's what she looks like, right there.

28:51.254 --> 28:54.791
Yeah, I saw a young girl with...

28:54.891 --> 28:57.428
- reddish-brown hair.
- That's the girl.

28:57.528 --> 29:01.050
Where did she go,
did you see where she went?

29:01.664 --> 29:04.086
I did see this young fellow...

29:06.637 --> 29:09.272
- Rig Marlowe.
- Rig Marlowe?

29:09.372 --> 29:11.808
Where would I find him?

29:11.908 --> 29:14.356
The Rusty Spur.

29:29.592 --> 29:32.047
Yeah, come in.

29:37.168 --> 29:39.853
Well, hello, Benedict.

29:39.953 --> 29:43.709
You're gonna be pleased with these, sir.

29:44.575 --> 29:49.146
You made 10% more this month
than you did the last month.

29:49.246 --> 29:51.549
- I see that.
- Yeah.

29:51.649 --> 29:53.851
Must've been from those...

29:53.951 --> 29:56.886
cowboys came through
on that cattle drive, you figure?

29:56.986 --> 29:59.990
Yeah, they came through in bundles.

30:00.090 --> 30:03.444
- They were generous.
- They were generous.

30:04.027 --> 30:07.263
Well, did you have Doc
check the girls out after they left?

30:07.363 --> 30:09.499
I hope they weren't too generous.

30:09.599 --> 30:13.236
We checked them out, sir,
and they're in good shape.

30:13.336 --> 30:15.039
Clean?

30:15.398 --> 30:18.342
You know that...

30:18.442 --> 30:23.066
we keep those girls extra clean.

30:23.981 --> 30:26.450
Yeah, I bet you do check 'em out.

30:26.550 --> 30:31.087
Speaking of the girls, how 'bout those new
girls, you having any trouble with them?

30:31.187 --> 30:35.993
We're not having any trouble except
one of them got the shit beat outta her.

30:36.093 --> 30:39.529
This drunk, just stomped her.

30:39.629 --> 30:42.500
And he was drunker than a monkey.

30:42.600 --> 30:45.903
- Well, we can't have that can we, Benedict?
- Hell no!

30:46.003 --> 30:49.773
- Go get the bastard and bring him in here.
- I'll get that son of a bitch.

30:49.873 --> 30:53.529
- Well, get your ass up, go get him!
- I'm going, I'm going.

30:55.612 --> 31:00.602
Hey, you. You son of a bitch,
get over there.

31:01.684 --> 31:05.656
Have a seat, friend. What do you think
I ought to do with him, Benedict?

31:05.756 --> 31:08.844
Well, I think you outta cut his balls off.

31:09.692 --> 31:13.215
- Give us a minute, Benedict.
- Thank you.

31:17.134 --> 31:19.456
Now, son...

31:19.803 --> 31:24.327
we don't abide ill manners
in this establishment.

31:28.078 --> 31:31.033
It won't happen again, sir.

31:32.348 --> 31:35.302
Something else we don't abide by...

31:39.923 --> 31:43.713
Trash like you
fucking with the merchandise.

31:45.096 --> 31:49.585
Son of a bitch wanted to hurt my sweetie.

31:54.938 --> 31:57.695
Somebody come in here
and clean this shit up!

32:14.557 --> 32:17.027
Looking for someone, mister?

32:17.127 --> 32:21.482
Yeah. I got something
that belongs to Rig Marlowe.

32:21.965 --> 32:24.521
Haven't seen him all day.

32:26.136 --> 32:29.226
Any idea where I might find him?

32:29.606 --> 32:34.831
Anywhere he can put his hands
on a pretty girl, or a deck of cards.

32:36.146 --> 32:38.760
If I see him, who should I say is calling?

32:39.700 --> 32:41.689
Chester Alan Arthur.

32:47.590 --> 32:50.779
He a friend of yours, Mr. President?

32:52.127 --> 32:54.597
Never met the man.

32:54.697 --> 32:57.953
Just delivering his property, you say?

32:59.235 --> 33:01.460
Yes, sir.

33:02.872 --> 33:06.609
Spinning Wheel Saloon, across the way.

33:06.709 --> 33:09.265
You ain't looking for trouble
now, son, are ya?

33:14.150 --> 33:19.390
You remind me of a young'in that passed
through here, fire in his eyes like yours.

33:19.490 --> 33:22.179
I'm gonna tell you
the same thing I told him.

33:23.526 --> 33:25.996
There's a battle in every man.

33:26.096 --> 33:30.019
Two wolves that exist inside each of us.

33:31.435 --> 33:36.573
One's evil and anger,
the other's love and hope.

33:36.773 --> 33:39.174
You know which one wins?

33:40.177 --> 33:42.822
The one you feed.

33:53.790 --> 33:56.680
Which one you gonna feed, hoss?

34:48.745 --> 34:51.014
- What can I do ya for?
- I'm looking for Rig Marlowe.

34:51.114 --> 34:54.851
Gent with the red vest,
poker table with Charlie and Silas.

34:54.951 --> 34:57.788
- You got chips at the bar here?
- I do.

34:57.888 --> 35:00.877
- Thank you.
- Much obliged.

35:03.093 --> 35:05.914
You gentlemen looking for a fourth?

35:06.496 --> 35:09.433
If you stop this man
from stealing our money.

35:09.533 --> 35:13.589
Just a run of luck. Have a seat.

35:16.238 --> 35:20.209
Name's Rig Marlowe.
This here's Charlie, Silas.

35:20.309 --> 35:23.046
Haven't had the privilege
of their surnames yet.

35:23.146 --> 35:25.548
Arthur Alan.

35:25.648 --> 35:28.819
Well, Arthur with two first names...

35:28.919 --> 35:31.273
two dollar ante.

35:31.522 --> 35:35.945
- You boys from around here?
- Ain't nobody from around here.

35:37.861 --> 35:39.796
What you have in mind?

35:39.896 --> 35:43.733
Well, I'm looking for
a little female companionship.

35:43.833 --> 35:46.588
I'm partial to the young ones.

35:47.169 --> 35:50.808
All the girls in here...
little long in the tooth.

35:50.908 --> 35:53.895
Well, you haven't even seen 'em all yet.

35:55.178 --> 35:58.834
You just got here. Five dollars.

35:59.182 --> 36:01.617
- How many?
- I'll take one.

36:01.717 --> 36:03.022
Two.

36:04.620 --> 36:06.041
Two more.

36:08.859 --> 36:11.425
Let's have a look, Silas.

36:11.794 --> 36:13.330
Two pair.

36:13.430 --> 36:17.267
Guess you are lucky, Mister.
I mean, at least for me anyway.

36:17.367 --> 36:20.471
The Rusty Spur has
the youngest whores in town.

36:20.571 --> 36:24.341
- And they don't put a hole in your pocket.
- Ain't that the truth?

36:24.441 --> 36:29.810
What about you, Mr. Marlowe?
You know anywhere to find the young ones?

36:30.447 --> 36:33.516
Seems like you're looking
for a particular girl, Arthur.

36:33.616 --> 36:35.252
Five dollars.

36:35.352 --> 36:37.753
They're all particular.

36:41.325 --> 36:43.727
- How many?
- Two.

36:43.827 --> 36:46.528
Same here.

36:46.997 --> 36:50.498
- Ten.
- Ten it is.

36:51.767 --> 36:55.542
Well, well, we find ourselves
in the same predicament.

36:55.772 --> 36:57.174
Marlowe?

36:57.274 --> 37:02.544
You never did answer me, Mr. Marlowe.
About the young ones.

37:06.783 --> 37:08.552
What you got?

37:08.652 --> 37:11.986
Full house. Queens over tens!

37:17.394 --> 37:19.472
Silas.

37:21.398 --> 37:24.034
Silas, what the hell you doing, boy?

37:24.134 --> 37:27.335
Funny thing is I got queens too.

37:27.770 --> 37:30.224
Let's not be hasty, friend.

37:30.324 --> 37:33.976
You know this is the second time today
that I counted five queens.

37:34.076 --> 37:37.044
- You sure 'bout that?
- Hell yeah.

37:38.581 --> 37:41.285
How do we know where the fifth lady
came from? You were the dealer!

37:41.385 --> 37:43.120
That's exactly how I know!

37:43.220 --> 37:46.400
All right, now just put
that gun away, sit down

37:46.500 --> 37:50.791
- and we'll work this out peaceful like.
- Are you in on this with him?

37:57.234 --> 37:58.501
You son of a bitch!

37:58.601 --> 38:03.839
You arrived this morning from Newton
with my daughter Lily, Lily Travis!

38:03.939 --> 38:06.273
Now where is she?

38:06.743 --> 38:08.610
Where?

38:11.213 --> 38:13.231
Shit.

38:34.004 --> 38:36.238
Find what you were looking for, hoss?

38:36.338 --> 38:40.608
Yeah. And now I'm looking for your boss.

38:42.111 --> 38:45.987
- That'll be Ty Stover.
- And where do I find him?

38:47.783 --> 38:50.851
Top of the stairs,
first door on the right.

39:29.158 --> 39:31.595
You Ty Stover?

39:31.695 --> 39:34.131
Yeah, I'm Ty Stover.

39:34.731 --> 39:37.165
I'm looking for my daughter.

39:37.833 --> 39:41.537
She's 17, got reddish brown hair.

39:41.637 --> 39:43.740
Named Lily Travis.

39:43.840 --> 39:48.108
She was walking to your saloon
this morning with Rig Marlowe.

39:51.580 --> 39:53.614
Haven't seen her.

39:55.819 --> 40:00.321
But I'm in and out all day, I'm...

40:00.924 --> 40:03.992
Wichita's Fire Chief.

40:07.898 --> 40:10.932
Maybe you outta ask Marlowe.

40:12.369 --> 40:14.335
I did.

40:15.939 --> 40:18.107
Well, if Marlowe doesn't know, then...

40:18.207 --> 40:21.708
whoever gave you that information
must be mistaken.

40:21.978 --> 40:26.231
It's not that he didn't know,
he couldn't tell me.

40:29.686 --> 40:31.853
He's dead.

40:36.792 --> 40:39.962
Mr. Travis?

40:40.062 --> 40:43.316
- Clay Travis.
- Mr. Travis.

40:43.416 --> 40:46.117
I may run a brothel...

40:47.970 --> 40:51.158
But I run it in accordance with the law.

41:03.720 --> 41:08.606
Maybe you're right.
'Bout my information being wrong.

41:12.229 --> 41:15.530
I apologize for taking your time, sir.

41:16.699 --> 41:18.783
It's quite all right.

41:21.303 --> 41:24.204
Close the door.

41:44.060 --> 41:48.131
Have you seen this girl?
She's got reddish-brown hair.

41:48.231 --> 41:50.500
17 years old.

41:50.600 --> 41:52.834
No, I haven't seen her, sugar.

41:52.934 --> 41:55.840
<i>Flies in the buttermilk, shoo, fly, shoo</i>

41:55.940 --> 41:59.401
<i>Skip to my Lou, my darling</i>

41:59.501 --> 42:02.868
<i>Lou, Lou, skip to my Lou</i>

42:02.968 --> 42:07.582
<i>Skip to my Lou, my darling</i>

42:08.818 --> 42:11.353
Why are you singing that song?

42:11.653 --> 42:14.290
I heard one of the girls singing it today.

42:14.390 --> 42:16.726
Can't seem to get it outta my head.

42:16.826 --> 42:19.029
Was it this girl?

42:19.129 --> 42:22.065
Look at the picture. Was it her?

42:22.165 --> 42:24.967
Look at the picture, darling,
she's my daughter.

42:25.067 --> 42:27.368
Have you seen her?

42:28.203 --> 42:30.574
Yeah. Yeah, that's her.

42:30.674 --> 42:33.410
Where? Where did you see her?

42:33.510 --> 42:36.834
- I don't know.
- It's my daughter!

42:41.083 --> 42:45.786
Hands off the girl.
We don't want no trouble here, son.

43:01.655 --> 43:04.289
Time for you to go outside, buddy.

43:27.230 --> 43:28.580
Jesus.

44:48.728 --> 44:54.367
You got two seconds to tell me what I wanna
know before I pump you full of lead.

44:54.467 --> 44:58.002
Where is she? Where?

45:01.491 --> 45:03.761
Get the hell outta here.

45:04.461 --> 45:07.462
We don't want that kind of trouble.

45:31.120 --> 45:33.988
I guess we know which wolf won.

45:35.124 --> 45:38.508
What did you expect? It's his daughter.

45:39.395 --> 45:42.460
What would you do if someone
disappeared one of your kin?

45:44.234 --> 45:48.469
I reckon I'd feed the same hungry beast.

47:24.199 --> 47:27.503
- Son of a bitch!
- Where is she?

47:28.103 --> 47:32.008
- Mr. Travis! You have to believe me!
- Where?

47:32.108 --> 47:35.645
When I tell ya that I have no idea
where your daughter is.

47:35.745 --> 47:38.380
I don't know what Marlowe did with her!

47:38.680 --> 47:41.147
Where is she?

47:43.486 --> 47:48.690
Fuck you!
I should've killed you in my goddamn bar!

47:48.790 --> 47:51.059
You son of a bitch!

47:55.065 --> 47:58.712
- Where is she?
- Cut me loose and I'll tell you!

48:02.671 --> 48:04.974
Cut me loose.

48:05.074 --> 48:07.341
Tell me first!

48:09.279 --> 48:11.401
I traded her!

48:12.115 --> 48:14.716
- You traded my daughter?
- That's right, I traded her.

48:14.816 --> 48:19.419
- Traded her for what?
- I traded her for that fucking bell!

48:20.356 --> 48:22.959
You traded my daughter for a goddamn bell?

48:23.059 --> 48:25.361
Yeah. I did.

48:25.461 --> 48:27.195
To who?

48:32.034 --> 48:34.514
LaVoie!

48:36.471 --> 48:39.238
Where the hell is he?

48:40.575 --> 48:44.346
- He's on a train.
- Train to where?

48:44.446 --> 48:46.080
Dodge City.

48:49.651 --> 48:52.990
Now... set me free...

48:53.090 --> 48:56.026
or you'll die in this town.

48:56.126 --> 48:59.661
You're a dead man. You'll die right here,
you won't ever get out.

48:59.761 --> 49:03.131
- I'll set you free.
- Set me free, goddamn it!

49:03.231 --> 49:05.732
Yeah, I'll set you free!

49:27.157 --> 49:29.424
Train to Dodge?

49:29.524 --> 49:31.412
Train just left.

49:35.565 --> 49:38.130
Clay Travis.

49:38.901 --> 49:41.336
Damn, I knew it was you.

49:41.436 --> 49:44.204
You killed five men in Abilene.

49:44.906 --> 49:48.345
- Nearly 15 years ago.
- Yeah.

49:48.645 --> 49:53.183
You killed my best friend Willie Parker.
Just turned 17.

49:53.283 --> 49:55.716
He drew first.

49:55.817 --> 49:58.885
That ain't what he told me before he died.

50:04.494 --> 50:07.405
Some men choose to cast themselves
in a brighter light

50:07.505 --> 50:09.766
before they meet their maker.

50:09.966 --> 50:14.301
And Kansas soil's full of fools
who thought they were quicker.

50:37.859 --> 50:41.563
Ya! Come on! Come on, come on!

50:41.663 --> 50:44.534
Ain't no damn way
he's gonna catch that train.

51:57.373 --> 51:59.440
Lily?

52:01.544 --> 52:03.877
I'm sorry, ma'am.

52:13.489 --> 52:15.566
Ticket.

52:16.725 --> 52:18.928
I didn't have a chance to buy a ticket.

52:19.028 --> 52:21.782
- Five dollars.
- Five?

52:28.487 --> 52:31.521
How long does it take to get to Dodge?

52:34.375 --> 52:38.549
Day's end. If nothing goes wrong.

52:43.285 --> 52:45.852
What do you got in that coach back there?

52:47.222 --> 52:52.028
- Empty. Like your goddamn head.
- Maybe I'll take a seat back there.

52:52.128 --> 52:55.131
Maybe you'll sit your ass
right where you're at.

52:55.231 --> 52:58.819
Train's moving. It's dangerous.

53:18.421 --> 53:20.989
Five minutes to Dodge City.

53:21.089 --> 53:23.423
Five minutes.

53:51.521 --> 53:54.555
Hey! Get outta there!

54:41.870 --> 54:45.107
Apples, fresh apples, two cents a piece.

54:45.207 --> 54:49.042
Three for a nickel. Apple?
Two cents a piece.

54:52.448 --> 54:57.118
Apples, fresh apples.
Two cents a piece, three for a nickel.

54:57.218 --> 55:01.621
Care for an apple sir? Two cents a piece.
Care for an apple, sir?

55:02.957 --> 55:06.192
Fresh apples. Two cents a piece.

55:19.942 --> 55:22.476
Mister, are you alive?

55:47.770 --> 55:50.171
Who are you?

55:50.271 --> 55:52.275
Name's Girl.

55:53.575 --> 55:55.308
Girl?

55:56.144 --> 55:59.511
They call me Girl 'cause
I'm too ugly to have a name.

56:03.786 --> 56:07.424
- Where am I?
- Shack. Dodge City.

56:12.795 --> 56:15.362
This your sweetheart?

56:15.665 --> 56:17.510
Give me that.

56:18.234 --> 56:20.503
That's my daughter.

56:20.603 --> 56:22.868
Right pretty.

56:25.758 --> 56:29.476
You live here by yourself?

56:30.812 --> 56:32.949
Me and my pa.

56:33.049 --> 56:34.983
He's not my real pa, but...

56:35.283 --> 56:38.654
he was married to my ma
before she was took by the angels.

56:38.754 --> 56:40.723
Where is he?

56:41.423 --> 56:43.289
Working.

56:43.993 --> 56:46.027
He'll be home tonight.

56:46.127 --> 56:49.161
He always comes home every night.

57:02.311 --> 57:04.614
I gotta use your privy.

57:04.714 --> 57:07.160
Out back.

57:11.852 --> 57:14.665
Pa's got the key.

57:26.568 --> 57:28.371
This here's silk.

57:28.471 --> 57:31.506
It still smells like
my mama's lavender scent.

57:31.606 --> 57:34.475
She said she got it from France.

57:34.575 --> 57:38.043
I don't know where that is,
but I know it ain't anywheres near here.

57:38.513 --> 57:42.315
Europe. France is in Europe.

57:43.686 --> 57:46.656
Know what I made outta this here silk?

57:46.756 --> 57:48.424
A dress?

57:48.524 --> 57:50.893
Why would I waste it on that?

57:50.993 --> 57:53.029
I made this fine table covering.

57:53.129 --> 57:55.975
For fancy company.

57:56.432 --> 57:59.121
Well, with what you got left,
you should make yourself a dress,

57:59.221 --> 58:02.068
I bet you'd look real pretty in it.

58:06.908 --> 58:08.731
You got a wife Mr. Clay?

58:08.831 --> 58:11.412
Yes, I do.

58:13.649 --> 58:16.050
Your ranch very large?

58:18.003 --> 58:19.798
It's big enough.

58:22.657 --> 58:25.928
After you find your daughter, maybe
I could go back to your ranch with you?

58:26.028 --> 58:30.850
I'm a real hard worker and I can cook,
and I hardly eat anything.

58:33.535 --> 58:36.671
What about your pa?
Ain't he gonna miss ya?

58:36.771 --> 58:39.406
Ain't you gonna miss him?

58:41.592 --> 58:43.401
Well...

58:51.553 --> 58:53.154
Yeah...

58:53.254 --> 58:55.724
skin him, cook him up for stew.

58:55.824 --> 58:57.392
Yes, Pa.

58:57.492 --> 59:01.163
This... food here,

59:01.263 --> 59:04.132
ain't for free, stranger.

59:04.232 --> 59:06.835
I appreciate your daughter tending to me.

59:06.935 --> 59:10.402
I give you my word I'll repay you.

59:11.439 --> 59:14.640
Well, we can't eat promises, now, can we?

59:15.611 --> 59:18.279
I'm presently looking for my own daughter.

59:18.379 --> 59:21.808
I believe she's been imprisoned
in town as a whore.

59:22.751 --> 59:28.431
Tomorrow you give me a full day's work
and then I'll decide if it's enough.

59:28.531 --> 59:32.007
Time is crucial to me, sir.
I'd appreciate it.

59:32.527 --> 59:35.864
Hey! You can't leave me shackled here!

59:35.964 --> 59:37.863
Girl!

59:38.599 --> 59:41.501
Give him a pot to relieve himself with.

59:42.337 --> 59:44.770
And you get your ass in the back room.

59:45.775 --> 59:47.341
Now!

01:00:41.468 --> 01:00:43.898
Son of a bitch!

01:00:43.998 --> 01:00:47.017
We start work at sun up 'round here.

01:00:56.712 --> 01:01:00.233
I hope you like bacon,
eggs and hot biscuits, Mr. Clay.

01:01:04.219 --> 01:01:06.686
Now what's this?

01:01:07.221 --> 01:01:11.372
I made a fine table covering
outta my mama's silk from Paris.

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:13.776
Paris?

01:01:15.063 --> 01:01:18.132
This came from your mama's
shack in Abilene.

01:01:21.169 --> 01:01:23.704
A horny merchant came by and...

01:01:23.804 --> 01:01:29.444
he exchanged this red silk
for some afternoon pussy.

01:01:30.711 --> 01:01:33.291
You see, her mother was a...

01:01:33.391 --> 01:01:35.282
silver dollar whore.

01:01:36.585 --> 01:01:40.016
And she deserved every
purple trophy that she got.

01:01:40.116 --> 01:01:43.653
- You're a rotten liar.
- Say that again, Girl.

01:01:44.825 --> 01:01:46.692
Nothing.

01:01:53.768 --> 01:01:57.938
I hope we didn't rile
your slumber last night.

01:01:59.141 --> 01:02:01.506
I mean, we...

01:02:01.606 --> 01:02:06.545
Girl and me, we... well, we rattled
them floorboards, didn't we, Girl?

01:02:08.584 --> 01:02:13.522
You know she got a face
that'll kinda break a looking glass.

01:02:13.622 --> 01:02:16.055
But thank the Lord.

01:02:17.159 --> 01:02:19.414
She got her mama's pussy.

01:02:23.531 --> 01:02:27.265
This is a feast fit for the mayor himself.

01:02:29.238 --> 01:02:32.939
I may have to have you
work two days for me, boy.

01:02:36.277 --> 01:02:37.945
Damn!

01:02:39.147 --> 01:02:41.451
You know how I like my biscuits.

01:02:42.517 --> 01:02:45.118
Smothered with honey.

01:02:47.823 --> 01:02:50.290
Now you go and bring me that honey.

01:03:10.545 --> 01:03:13.025
Unshackle me.

01:03:24.859 --> 01:03:27.999
10 dollars I squirreled away from Pa.

01:03:28.099 --> 01:03:32.545
Take it, Mr. Clay.
You'll be needing it to find your daughter.

01:03:33.368 --> 01:03:35.653
Thank you.

01:04:09.737 --> 01:04:13.108
Hey, mister, someone's looking
for you in the Lady Gay.

01:04:13.408 --> 01:04:15.977
- Who's looking for me?
- Room nine.

01:04:16.077 --> 01:04:19.045
You sure you got the right fella?

01:04:33.161 --> 01:04:36.532
Hey, Sugar, do you wanna poke?

01:04:36.732 --> 01:04:39.530
I'm looking for room number nine.

01:05:01.655 --> 01:05:03.956
Long time.

01:05:05.927 --> 01:05:07.756
Nell Craft.

01:05:08.496 --> 01:05:10.831
Damn you, Clay Travis.

01:05:11.832 --> 01:05:15.736
I was hoping you'd be all scarred
and wrinkled like a dried-up prune.

01:05:15.836 --> 01:05:18.840
Been a long time. You work here?

01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:21.542
Not much interest in a 40-year-old whore.

01:05:21.642 --> 01:05:23.844
I own the place.

01:05:23.944 --> 01:05:27.582
- Nell, you look great.
- The hell I do.

01:05:28.136 --> 01:05:32.659
I wasn't quite sure how you'd react
if we ever saw each other again.

01:05:32.759 --> 01:05:34.557
Likewise.

01:05:35.157 --> 01:05:37.926
Is there something
I could've done different, Clay?

01:05:38.026 --> 01:05:41.229
- Anything different to get you to stay?
- Nell...

01:05:41.329 --> 01:05:45.564
Because I believe I did just about
everything a girl could possibly do.

01:05:47.536 --> 01:05:49.870
And then some.

01:05:49.970 --> 01:05:54.043
In the end, I guess I just ended up
falling in love with a different...

01:05:54.143 --> 01:05:56.042
Whore?

01:05:57.012 --> 01:05:59.314
Different woman.

01:05:59.714 --> 01:06:02.883
How is our dear Amelia?

01:06:02.983 --> 01:06:05.717
She's out of sorts.

01:06:06.388 --> 01:06:09.155
For old time's sake...

01:06:10.324 --> 01:06:12.925
can I trust you, Nell?

01:06:13.661 --> 01:06:16.195
For old time's sake.

01:06:17.466 --> 01:06:20.000
This is our daughter.

01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:21.737
Pretty thing.

01:06:22.437 --> 01:06:25.708
- How old?
- She's 17.

01:06:26.908 --> 01:06:30.812
She arrived this morning,
by train in a cattle car

01:06:30.912 --> 01:06:35.991
with a few other young girls,
under the gun of a man named LaVoie.

01:06:36.618 --> 01:06:38.953
LaVoie recruits new girls.

01:06:39.053 --> 01:06:42.287
The demand exceeds the supply in Dodge.

01:06:42.758 --> 01:06:45.511
Where do I find LaVoie?

01:06:45.611 --> 01:06:48.829
Even you are no match for LaVoie.

01:06:48.929 --> 01:06:52.931
Samuel Colt's been known
to make all men equal.

01:06:53.602 --> 01:06:58.461
If he's got your daughter, she'll never
be the same little girl you remember.

01:06:58.561 --> 01:07:01.409
My advice to you? Go home.

01:07:01.509 --> 01:07:04.710
Be with your Amelia and that little boy.

01:07:05.146 --> 01:07:07.582
I can't do that.

01:07:07.882 --> 01:07:10.151
Then stay here with me.

01:07:10.251 --> 01:07:13.152
Let me show you what you've been missing.

01:07:14.723 --> 01:07:17.424
Where's LaVoie, Nell?

01:07:20.528 --> 01:07:24.064
He took possession
of a whorehouse across the way.

01:07:24.164 --> 01:07:26.866
Calls it the French Chateau.

01:07:29.204 --> 01:07:32.071
Good seeing ya again, Nell.

01:07:33.741 --> 01:07:35.775
Likewise.

01:07:43.352 --> 01:07:46.989
While you boys are gallivanting
around town...

01:07:47.089 --> 01:07:50.592
- I need you to gather me up some strays.
- You mean girls?

01:07:50.692 --> 01:07:53.562
Cats, roans living here
outnumber the whores.

01:07:53.662 --> 01:07:58.563
I found me a rat almost the size
of a beaver this morning, Daddy.

01:07:59.868 --> 01:08:02.835
Wasn't Uncle Barkley supposed
to be on the train this morning?

01:08:03.638 --> 01:08:06.942
He has some important business
to attend to, son.

01:08:07.042 --> 01:08:08.875
Now...

01:08:09.411 --> 01:08:14.614
My brother has had his shortcomings
in the past, it's true.

01:08:15.533 --> 01:08:19.504
But when I left that man
at that depot in Wichita...

01:08:19.604 --> 01:08:22.657
he was clear-eyed and sober.

01:08:22.756 --> 01:08:24.233
Praise the lord.

01:08:24.332 --> 01:08:29.298
Mama always said Uncle Barkley
was gonna find the Lord's hand.

01:08:29.398 --> 01:08:33.435
I ain't never been accused of being
a church-going man, now, have I, Kipp?

01:08:33.535 --> 01:08:37.305
- No, sir.
- But in this case...

01:08:37.406 --> 01:08:41.776
I'm gonna have to align myself
with your mama.

01:08:41.876 --> 01:08:45.345
Because nothing, now you all listen up...

01:08:45.446 --> 01:08:50.984
nothing, and I mean nothing
in the whole world,

01:08:51.085 --> 01:08:55.220
is more important than family.

01:08:56.425 --> 01:08:58.727
A family...

01:08:59.027 --> 01:09:01.161
in harmony...

01:09:01.261 --> 01:09:03.331
will prosper...

01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:05.764
in everything.

01:09:06.768 --> 01:09:09.571
That's an old Chinese proverb.

01:09:09.871 --> 01:09:12.340
That's one we should all live by.

01:09:12.439 --> 01:09:14.256
Yeah, Daddy.

01:09:14.774 --> 01:09:17.211
Bless the Chinese.

01:09:17.310 --> 01:09:19.544
Come in.

01:09:21.750 --> 01:09:23.551
Before you start talking,

01:09:23.651 --> 01:09:27.453
I need one of ya to talk
for both of ya, understand?

01:09:28.689 --> 01:09:31.593
All us girls got some demands.

01:09:31.693 --> 01:09:33.795
We want to be treated proper.

01:09:33.895 --> 01:09:37.933
Enough sleep so we don't got
darkness under our eyes.

01:09:38.033 --> 01:09:41.435
A few minutes to ourselves between turns.

01:09:41.536 --> 01:09:43.104
A day off.

01:09:43.203 --> 01:09:48.274
Proper doctoring, not just a quick
sideways glance at our snatch.

01:10:12.933 --> 01:10:15.267
Anything else?

01:10:16.770 --> 01:10:19.304
That's the gist of it.

01:10:45.033 --> 01:10:47.832
Anything else you wanna discuss?

01:10:50.038 --> 01:10:52.139
Now when they ask you,

01:10:52.239 --> 01:10:55.076
you tell 'em that whore's snatch went dry,

01:10:55.176 --> 01:10:59.047
and she left town to try
her luck in Colorado...

01:10:59.147 --> 01:11:01.446
you understand?

01:11:01.882 --> 01:11:04.085
Anything else...

01:11:04.185 --> 01:11:06.888
you'll end up just like her.

01:11:06.988 --> 01:11:08.922
Now get!

01:11:25.606 --> 01:11:28.944
Afternoon, gents!
Welcome to the French Chateau.

01:11:29.044 --> 01:11:33.034
Women to the left,
liquor to the right. Hey.

01:11:33.682 --> 01:11:35.515
Afternoon.

01:11:37.486 --> 01:11:40.549
Lee Crawford. But you can call me LaVoie.

01:11:47.462 --> 01:11:51.131
Hey, Kipp, get this fine gentleman
here my best glass of whiskey.

01:11:51.231 --> 01:11:53.033
Yes, Daddy.

01:11:53.133 --> 01:11:55.401
That's my son.

01:11:55.670 --> 01:11:58.472
- Welcome.
- Good boy.

01:11:58.572 --> 01:12:02.140
So what brings you out
'round these parts here, friend?

01:12:02.876 --> 01:12:04.943
A girl.

01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:10.950
Girl? Well, cowboy,
you in the right place.

01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:13.521
Tess!

01:12:13.621 --> 01:12:15.853
This here Tess.

01:12:18.626 --> 01:12:20.761
She's awful purdy and young,

01:12:20.861 --> 01:12:23.475
but I'm looking for something
a little different.

01:12:24.132 --> 01:12:26.798
- Different?
- Different.

01:12:28.603 --> 01:12:31.504
Well, this one ain't for sale.

01:12:31.772 --> 01:12:34.008
But it's your lucky day, cowboy.

01:12:34.108 --> 01:12:37.996
We just got a shipment of young gals,
just ripe and fine for the plucking.

01:12:38.096 --> 01:12:40.477
But they ain't cheap, see that?

01:12:41.316 --> 01:12:43.517
Ten dollars.

01:12:49.957 --> 01:12:54.194
All right. Tess, take this fine
gentleman upstairs right now!

01:12:54.294 --> 01:12:58.666
And I'm gonna send a girl up there once
they have her all polished up for you.

01:12:58.766 --> 01:13:02.136
All right, I ain't gonna forget you now.

01:13:02.436 --> 01:13:05.606
- Hey, Kipp, what do you think?
- I don't like him.

01:13:05.706 --> 01:13:08.774
I don't like him either.
I don't like him at all.

01:13:12.846 --> 01:13:17.649
This way, honey.
We'll take real good care of you.

01:13:28.063 --> 01:13:32.199
Don't worry, the curtains
are for the three dollar whores.

01:13:32.299 --> 01:13:35.300
You paid for a private room.

01:13:44.646 --> 01:13:48.929
Don't be nervous, sweetie.
We cater to all types here.

01:13:49.029 --> 01:13:51.550
The new girl will help you out.

01:13:57.525 --> 01:14:00.924
No! No!

01:14:12.439 --> 01:14:14.507
Please.

01:14:15.810 --> 01:14:18.109
Shut your mouth!

01:14:18.378 --> 01:14:20.931
Get up, you son of a bitch!

01:14:21.281 --> 01:14:23.126
- Pa!
- Hey!

01:14:23.226 --> 01:14:27.555
Go ahead. I'll put a bullet
right between your eyes.

01:14:27.655 --> 01:14:29.987
Please help.

01:14:30.457 --> 01:14:33.593
Come on, darling. Come on.

01:14:34.162 --> 01:14:35.664
Come on now.

01:14:40.769 --> 01:14:43.802
- Jed!
- What?

01:14:51.266 --> 01:14:54.816
- Come on, daughter.
- Son of a bitch!

01:14:57.352 --> 01:14:59.918
Goddamn it, go get him! Go!

01:15:09.196 --> 01:15:11.730
Come on, damn it!

01:15:15.736 --> 01:15:19.406
- Take her outta here!
- I'm not leaving you! I'm so sorry!

01:15:19.506 --> 01:15:21.881
- Run!
- You better run, little girl!

01:15:21.981 --> 01:15:23.438
Run, run, run!

01:15:23.538 --> 01:15:26.280
Can't have you running off
and stealing the merchandise!

01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:29.346
We got a surprise for you today!

01:17:10.317 --> 01:17:12.884
What you want, Mills?

01:17:14.755 --> 01:17:17.923
Telegraph for your father.

01:17:31.739 --> 01:17:34.206
Get the fuck on!

01:18:01.836 --> 01:18:04.121
God, what have I done?

01:18:04.221 --> 01:18:06.668
- It's all right.
- I'm so sorry.

01:18:07.208 --> 01:18:11.145
Clay Travis. I believe
you're familiar with a Nell Craft?

01:18:11.245 --> 01:18:15.346
You did her quite an injustice,
years back in Abilene.

01:18:15.815 --> 01:18:20.754
You neglected to tell me that you
had kinfolk under my roof, Mr. Travis.

01:18:20.854 --> 01:18:25.555
I'll pay you whatever you want
to leave my daughter alone.

01:18:26.526 --> 01:18:29.863
I bet you would! But money ain't an issue.

01:18:29.963 --> 01:18:33.666
See, you killed a man...

01:18:33.801 --> 01:18:35.969
in Wichita.

01:18:36.269 --> 01:18:41.187
- He drew on me first!
- And that man... was my brother.

01:18:47.781 --> 01:18:49.918
You kill my family,

01:18:50.018 --> 01:18:52.252
I will have my pound of flesh.

01:18:52.352 --> 01:18:56.194
Now I could just put a bullet in your
fucking head right now, but why do that?

01:18:56.524 --> 01:19:00.808
Why not have some fun, why not?

01:19:02.697 --> 01:19:05.299
Blacksmith said this was
the best he could muster up boss.

01:19:05.399 --> 01:19:09.248
All right, that's good enough.
Tie him up, tie him good.

01:19:24.117 --> 01:19:26.421
Hell yeah!

01:19:26.521 --> 01:19:28.755
Good fortune done
brought you back here, friend.

01:19:28.855 --> 01:19:31.289
But I don't reckon you'd agree, would ya?

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:37.063
Sir, a lady's causing a ruckus downstairs
about the girl you shot.

01:19:37.163 --> 01:19:41.836
I don't care! These women, you can't live
with 'em, and you can't live without 'em.

01:19:41.936 --> 01:19:45.970
Now another thing I took away
from my time with the Chinese...

01:19:46.906 --> 01:19:49.340
Gathering info.

01:19:50.845 --> 01:19:52.245
See, during the war,

01:19:52.345 --> 01:19:57.262
say when you're in a position with some
information, this here done did the trick.

01:19:59.018 --> 01:20:01.822
Opened them Union boys right up.

01:20:01.922 --> 01:20:04.025
See, this rodent here?

01:20:04.125 --> 01:20:07.095
The only thing on this rodent's mind...

01:20:07.195 --> 01:20:10.530
is this here fire,
and how to get away from it.

01:20:10.630 --> 01:20:12.868
I seen grown men...

01:20:13.668 --> 01:20:16.003
call out for their mamas.

01:20:16.103 --> 01:20:20.372
Begging for a bullet in the head.

01:20:22.242 --> 01:20:24.644
And when that rat realizes
there's no way out,

01:20:24.744 --> 01:20:27.247
he's gonna start
gnawing away at your skin.

01:20:27.347 --> 01:20:30.437
He's gonna gradually eat
his way through your insides.

01:20:31.017 --> 01:20:34.502
Tears a hole from your gut
through your back.

01:20:36.323 --> 01:20:39.393
Yeah. Now you two, you stay here,

01:20:39.493 --> 01:20:43.264
until our little rat friend here
has done his job.

01:20:43.364 --> 01:20:48.494
And that's when you can see this table
through his stomach, okay?

01:20:48.594 --> 01:20:51.470
And no matter how much he begs...

01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:54.762
don't put a bullet in him.

01:20:55.710 --> 01:20:58.424
Hey! Travis.

01:20:58.913 --> 01:21:01.830
I'll be seeing ya, friend.

01:21:27.257 --> 01:21:31.029
I can abide by shooting an unruly whore.

01:21:31.379 --> 01:21:35.216
But no man should be tortured like this.

01:21:35.316 --> 01:21:38.115
And it's gross.

01:21:45.093 --> 01:21:46.959
Jed.

01:21:48.028 --> 01:21:50.329
Jed, come back.

01:22:12.620 --> 01:22:16.589
It doesn't seem right for her to leave town
without saying a word, she was my friend.

01:22:16.689 --> 01:22:19.359
Ivory said she heard gunshots
from your office.

01:22:19.459 --> 01:22:22.395
- Yeah, yeah, that's right.
- Gunshots?

01:22:24.432 --> 01:22:27.768
Fellas, you and Mills
showing off your draw. Right Mills?

01:22:27.868 --> 01:22:30.271
Yeah, yeah, that was me!

01:22:30.371 --> 01:22:32.172
Dumb son of a bitch.

01:22:32.272 --> 01:22:35.274
It's not right for her, she would not
leave town without saying a word.

01:22:35.374 --> 01:22:38.546
She did express a very strong desire

01:22:38.646 --> 01:22:41.780
to leave Dodge City.

01:22:42.150 --> 01:22:43.783
And I obliged.

01:22:45.585 --> 01:22:49.356
Now, I suspect your paths will cross...

01:22:49.456 --> 01:22:53.962
again. Sooner or later.

01:22:54.062 --> 01:22:56.665
In Colorado, yes?

01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:03.703
Now either of you got any other complaints
about how you're being treated?

01:23:03.803 --> 01:23:06.304
If you do, you come see me.

01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:09.108
And I'll arrange your travel.

01:23:09.208 --> 01:23:12.747
Just like I did for Fran.

01:23:12.847 --> 01:23:18.115
Now get back on that goddamn floor
and sell those asses, now!

01:23:20.119 --> 01:23:23.521
Son of a... What the hell?

01:23:24.458 --> 01:23:27.395
What the hell? I want him dead!

01:23:27.495 --> 01:23:30.962
You know where to look,
go kill that son of a bitch!

01:23:32.665 --> 01:23:35.132
Son of a bitch!

01:23:38.405 --> 01:23:42.407
Kipp, Jed, get your asses down here! Now!

01:23:43.544 --> 01:23:46.050
- What you need, boss?
- Yes, Daddy?

01:24:45.339 --> 01:24:48.324
You killed her, you killed that poor girl!

01:24:51.912 --> 01:24:54.500
Son of a bitch!

01:25:05.726 --> 01:25:08.327
You touch my daughter?

01:25:09.496 --> 01:25:12.208
I'm gonna send you straight to hell!

01:25:47.535 --> 01:25:49.934
Quit hiding, you coward!

01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:02.681
Come out here, you chicken shit!

01:26:18.197 --> 01:26:20.163
How do you like that?

01:26:21.034 --> 01:26:22.650
Shit.

01:26:23.804 --> 01:26:25.338
Fuck you!

01:26:43.190 --> 01:26:47.635
I'll be damned, Mr. President.
You caught the damned train.

01:26:48.629 --> 01:26:51.364
I've been thinking about
what you said at the Spur.

01:26:51.464 --> 01:26:54.233
Figured you could use a hand.

01:26:54.333 --> 01:26:56.703
Obliged, friend.

01:26:56.803 --> 01:27:00.139
I ain't for anyone beating no women.

01:27:00.239 --> 01:27:05.033
One wolf to another,
I reckon I'd done the same thing.

01:27:05.133 --> 01:27:10.411
And if it was my daughter,
I'd kill that son of a bitch dead.

01:27:12.853 --> 01:27:15.787
Now go get the son of a bitch.

01:27:23.964 --> 01:27:26.463
Come upstairs with me?

01:27:27.167 --> 01:27:29.703
I'm just here for whiskey,
I'm not armed, I'm not armed.

01:27:29.803 --> 01:27:32.337
Somebody's shooting downstairs!

01:27:38.778 --> 01:27:41.213
Where's he at?

01:27:41.814 --> 01:27:44.178
- Drop it, drop it!
- Easy.

01:27:44.278 --> 01:27:45.920
- Where is she?
- She ain't here.

01:27:46.020 --> 01:27:49.722
Lips or lead boy, you're gonna show me.
You're gonna show me!

01:27:49.822 --> 01:27:53.223
- You son of a bitch. Where?
- Behind you!

01:28:03.201 --> 01:28:05.670
Son of a bitch!

01:28:15.415 --> 01:28:17.716
Where's my daughter?

01:28:22.955 --> 01:28:25.122
Kipp!

01:28:29.363 --> 01:28:32.291
I'm not asking again.

01:28:36.402 --> 01:28:39.206
I ain't afraid to meet my maker.

01:28:41.375 --> 01:28:47.015
Family? When one piece is missing,
whole thing's broken.

01:28:48.147 --> 01:28:51.886
- You broke mine!
- You know what this was gonna be?

01:28:51.986 --> 01:28:55.774
This was gonna be
the best goddamn whorehouse

01:28:55.874 --> 01:28:58.511
west of the Mississippi.

01:29:00.194 --> 01:29:05.080
And your daughter's pussy
was gonna buy me a couple farms.

01:29:05.516 --> 01:29:07.818
Open your mouth!

01:29:07.918 --> 01:29:09.920
Open!

01:29:10.170 --> 01:29:12.557
Bite down on the barrel.

01:29:26.919 --> 01:29:30.588
Now someone tell me where my daughter is.

01:29:52.612 --> 01:29:55.080
Ain't no trains for a good minute.

01:29:56.383 --> 01:29:58.352
No, sir.

01:29:58.452 --> 01:30:01.519
Long ways back where you come from.

01:30:01.754 --> 01:30:03.588
Yes, sir.

01:30:04.824 --> 01:30:08.359
Longer still on your own two feet.

01:30:09.962 --> 01:30:12.994
Reckon you could use a horse.

01:30:13.966 --> 01:30:16.787
I reckon I got a horse.

01:30:16.887 --> 01:30:19.220
What will you do?

01:30:20.673 --> 01:30:24.358
Reckon I'll go somewhere quiet,
put my feet up

01:30:24.458 --> 01:30:27.311
and retire these here boots.

01:30:29.149 --> 01:30:31.585
It's been a long road...

01:30:31.685 --> 01:30:34.118
and I'm tired.

01:30:34.921 --> 01:30:37.895
But I'll find my way home.

01:30:41.228 --> 01:30:43.762
Take care, friend.

01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:25.638
- Pa, who was that man?
- He's just an old friend.

01:32:07.714 --> 01:32:09.563
Ma!

01:32:11.284 --> 01:32:13.152
Ma?

01:32:17.955 --> 01:32:19.824
Ma?

01:32:23.731 --> 01:32:25.597
Ma!

01:32:29.169 --> 01:32:31.622
Maybe she's in the barn.

01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:02.183
Lily!

01:33:02.703 --> 01:33:04.536
Wait!

01:33:39.366 --> 01:33:40.893
Lily!
