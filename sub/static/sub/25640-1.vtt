00:03.093 --> 00:05.320
(light, catchy instrumental music)

00:05.320 --> 00:06.153
- Oh, hello.

00:07.431 --> 00:09.930
I understand that what a viewer
asks for nowadays in a film

00:09.930 --> 00:13.270
is that it improves,
instructs, and elevates.

00:13.270 --> 00:16.200
Well, this film wouldn't elevate a cow.

00:16.200 --> 00:17.800
I cannot conscientiously recommend it

00:17.800 --> 00:20.250
for any useful purposes whatsoever.

00:20.250 --> 00:22.620
What I can suggest is
that when you get tired

00:22.620 --> 00:27.170
of superheroes, space battles,
and high production values,

00:27.170 --> 00:28.420
you might give us a try.

00:29.912 --> 00:31.088
Be a nice change.

00:31.088 --> 00:32.360
(metal rattles)

00:32.360 --> 00:33.193
But,

00:34.960 --> 00:36.610
I am in danger of skipping ahead.

00:37.920 --> 00:41.063
You want to know about her.

00:41.063 --> 00:44.980
You want to know how it
all got so complicated.

00:49.103 --> 00:53.186

(door beeps)

01:22.126 --> 01:24.543
(door beeps)

01:28.974 --> 01:31.391
(door beeps)

01:41.843 --> 01:45.593
(women gasping passionately)

02:04.023 --> 02:07.356
(blonde woman grunting)

02:13.360 --> 02:14.983
Okay!

02:14.983 --> 02:16.620
You can take your finger out of there.

02:20.371 --> 02:22.788
(door beeps)

02:23.811 --> 02:24.760
- You'll call, right?

02:29.210 --> 02:31.710
(Poppy sighs)

02:32.980 --> 02:34.110
- Being idle.

02:35.260 --> 02:38.960
Now this is something I consider
myself to be an expert on.

02:42.920 --> 02:46.240
My favorite teacher used to
say that she never knew a girl

02:46.240 --> 02:48.570
who could do less work in more time.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.140
I even remember my grandma saying

02:51.140 --> 02:53.460
that it was highly improbable
that I would ever do anything

02:53.460 --> 02:55.740
I shouldn't do, but she also said

02:55.740 --> 02:57.000
that I would also
probably never get around

02:57.000 --> 02:59.560
to doing anything that I should do.

02:59.560 --> 03:03.080
In fact, I have done a great many things

03:03.080 --> 03:04.900
I should not have done.

03:04.900 --> 03:06.630
But I have fully confirmed
her judgment so far

03:06.630 --> 03:09.230
as neglecting the things
that I should have done.

03:09.230 --> 03:11.040
I take no credit for it.

03:11.040 --> 03:11.873
It's a gift.

03:22.070 --> 03:23.820
I'll explain more about that later.

03:26.301 --> 03:30.051
(bemused instrumental music)

03:46.742 --> 03:48.810
- Okay, and once you've done
that, you need to call Hugo,

03:48.810 --> 03:52.370
and then Gabby and Mike, and
after that, Simon and Lucy.

03:52.370 --> 03:53.970
Are you listening to me, Dennis?

03:54.980 --> 03:57.810
Good, 'cause I have a whole
list of things for you to do.

03:58.762 --> 03:59.595
- Thank you.

04:02.300 --> 04:04.300
- [Voice On Phone] And now, we
will continue with our course

04:04.300 --> 04:06.560
on unlocking your hidden potential.

04:13.760 --> 04:15.180
- I can succeed.

04:19.257 --> 04:21.510
If I work hard, I will succeed.

04:24.590 --> 04:26.710
Success is mine for the taking!

04:36.000 --> 04:37.640
- Have you eveer considered
getting an alarm clock?

04:37.640 --> 04:39.056
- No.

04:39.056 --> 04:40.200
I hate alarm clocks.

04:40.200 --> 04:42.080
They always go off at the wrong time,

04:42.080 --> 04:43.230
alarm the wrong people.

04:44.392 --> 04:45.225
- Well, it'd be nice

04:45.225 --> 04:46.730
if you would turn up on time occasionally.

04:46.730 --> 04:50.370
- I know, but my bed's just too good.

04:50.370 --> 04:51.660
Every time I meant to get up early,

04:51.660 --> 04:52.920
I just find myself desperate

04:52.920 --> 04:55.370
for just a few more moments of sleep.

04:55.370 --> 04:56.203
- I've noticed.

04:58.522 --> 05:01.135
- No one sane ever gets up willingly.

05:01.135 --> 05:05.460
In fact, I once even knew a
girl who would actually get out

05:05.460 --> 05:07.204
and have a cold shower.

05:07.204 --> 05:08.470
(shower running)

05:08.470 --> 05:10.360
(woman gasping)

05:10.360 --> 05:11.300
And even then, that was of no use,

05:11.300 --> 05:13.980
because afterwards she would
jump back into bed again

05:13.980 --> 05:14.920
to warm herself.

05:18.715 --> 05:20.795
- Have you considered using a Taser?

05:20.795 --> 05:23.146
(Poppy laughs sarcastically)

05:23.146 --> 05:27.838
(bright, bemused instrumental music)

05:27.838 --> 05:31.421
(office telephone ringing)

06:09.360 --> 06:11.050
So, how are things?

06:11.908 --> 06:12.741
- Eh.

06:12.741 --> 06:14.210
Same as always.

06:14.210 --> 06:16.240
- Find anyone permanenet?

06:16.240 --> 06:17.073
- No.

06:18.140 --> 06:19.890
But I have found a few temporaries.

06:20.730 --> 06:21.790
- Good grief.

06:21.790 --> 06:23.230
You know, this city is not big;

06:23.230 --> 06:25.830
sooner or later, you're
gonna run out of fresh meat.

06:26.860 --> 06:27.760
- I'll do my best.

06:29.610 --> 06:34.190
Besides, what if I, you know,
meet the woman of my dreams

06:34.190 --> 06:36.364
but I'm already married or something?

06:36.364 --> 06:40.781
(subtle, bemused instrumental music)

06:41.980 --> 06:43.430
- I'm ready and raring to go.

06:44.870 --> 06:46.950
- [Female employer] So,
two years' experience.

06:46.950 --> 06:49.400
- Yes, but I'm a quick learner.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.960
- [Male employer] We were
looking for three to five years.

06:51.960 --> 06:54.050
- [Female employer] Yes,
three to five years.

06:56.920 --> 07:00.350
- So, you're not thinking
about settling down at all?

07:00.350 --> 07:02.410
- No, I don't need to, I'm happy.

07:03.744 --> 07:05.670
I don't need a relationship, I just...

07:07.141 --> 07:09.244
I just want the sex.

07:09.244 --> 07:11.170
(Gabby chuckles)

07:11.170 --> 07:12.982
- Sometimes I know what you mean.

07:12.982 --> 07:15.565
(Poppy laughs)

07:27.180 --> 07:28.940
- See, The biggest problem
I have at the moment

07:28.940 --> 07:33.940
is that I need to write
something, but I have no ideas.

07:37.836 --> 07:40.280
- But you're still good to
come babysitting tonight?

07:40.280 --> 07:41.310
- I don't know.

07:42.230 --> 07:44.550
Still got some of that cheescake left?

07:44.550 --> 07:45.383
- [Gabby] Yes.

07:45.383 --> 07:47.040
- Well then, of course.

07:48.130 --> 07:49.010
- You better be.

07:49.010 --> 07:51.220
Mike only takes me out
once in a blue moon.

07:51.220 --> 07:53.470
- Yeah, well, see, that's
what you get when you trade in

07:53.470 --> 07:55.377
your independence for stability.

07:55.377 --> 07:56.394
- [Gabby] Oh, wow.

07:56.394 --> 07:58.097
(Poppy laughs)

07:58.097 --> 08:02.180
(intimate acoustic-guitar music)

08:20.441 --> 08:23.274
(telephone rings)

08:26.278 --> 08:27.650
- Hi Pops, it's Angela.

08:27.650 --> 08:29.740
Look babe, we need to talk.

08:29.740 --> 08:31.560
You can't give me all
this hopes-and-dreams talk

08:31.560 --> 08:34.620
about your writing and
never do anything, alright?

08:34.620 --> 08:36.700
Call me, very soon.

08:38.650 --> 08:41.330
You know anyone else that
wants to represent Poppy Oaks?

08:43.144 --> 08:45.761
(blonde girl sighs)

08:45.761 --> 08:47.620
(chuckles) I didn't think so.

08:52.214 --> 08:54.714
(Poppy sighs)

08:56.808 --> 08:59.833
(cellphone buzzes)

08:59.833 --> 09:02.860
(empty, bittersweet instrumental music)

09:02.860 --> 09:03.693
- Hello?

09:03.693 --> 09:05.770
- [Female Caller] Hi, it's me.

09:05.770 --> 09:06.603
- Oh.

09:06.603 --> 09:08.092
Hi.

09:08.092 --> 09:09.660
- [Female Caller] I was
wondering if I left my blue shirt

09:09.660 --> 09:12.850
at your place when I moved
out; you know, my favorite one?

09:12.850 --> 09:14.670
- Mm, no.

09:15.690 --> 09:17.680
I don't think it's here.

09:17.680 --> 09:18.513
- [Female Caller] Oh.

09:20.092 --> 09:22.170
- But the red one with the stripes is.

09:22.170 --> 09:23.780
- [Female Caller] Well, just keep it.

09:23.780 --> 09:26.051
I guess I'll leave you with that shirt

09:26.051 --> 09:28.051
and my old letters, huh?

09:32.944 --> 09:35.527
(woman sighs)

09:58.145 --> 10:00.895
(toilet flushes)

10:04.504 --> 10:08.754
(light, catchy instrumental music)

10:48.070 --> 10:49.800
- I sat down with the full intention

10:49.800 --> 10:53.180
of writing something
original and clever, but

10:55.120 --> 10:57.020
can't think of anything that's either.

10:59.530 --> 11:01.180
I'm distracted because I'm broke.

11:02.460 --> 11:04.200
Before, when I was broke,

11:04.200 --> 11:07.020
I would recklessly spend a few dollars,

11:07.020 --> 11:09.570
merely for the sake of
having the change to jingle.

11:11.260 --> 11:14.110
You don't feel nearly so broke
with metal in your pocket.

11:17.710 --> 11:19.910
I've been an actor, and now I'm a writer,

11:19.910 --> 11:22.310
so I can speak with some authority

11:22.310 --> 11:23.810
on the subject of being broke.

11:24.750 --> 11:27.380
I have lived on nothing a week.

11:28.729 --> 11:31.160
(sighs) I have lived on half that.

11:33.769 --> 11:35.580
You want to find out the value of money,

11:35.580 --> 11:37.230
try living on nothing a week,

11:37.230 --> 11:41.230
and see how much you
can put by for clothes,

11:42.126 --> 11:44.570
or a night out.

11:46.590 --> 11:48.790
Everyone should try it just once.

11:52.390 --> 11:57.390
There are some people to whom
it would do a world of good.

12:16.189 --> 12:19.350
But it is dangerous to
become used to being hard up.

12:20.350 --> 12:22.150
We must always strive for more.

12:25.483 --> 12:28.140
(sighs)

12:28.140 --> 12:31.580
Besides, we're all hard up for something.

12:32.670 --> 12:34.300
There's community in that.

12:35.708 --> 12:38.625
(cellphone buzzes)

12:49.364 --> 12:51.000
(door beeps)

12:51.000 --> 12:55.083
(intimate acoustic-guitar music)

13:01.150 --> 13:03.474
Actually, you know what?

13:03.474 --> 13:04.837
- What?

13:04.837 --> 13:06.587
- I've got some wine.

13:19.188 --> 13:21.855
- Do you have any clean glasses?

13:22.759 --> 13:23.592
- Nope.

14:48.020 --> 14:50.780
- 644 words.

14:50.780 --> 14:51.710
It's not a lot,

14:54.190 --> 14:55.230
but it's a start.

14:56.870 --> 14:58.450
Gabby.

14:58.450 --> 14:59.450
Finally had an idea.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.820
- [Gabby] Is it a good idea?

15:02.820 --> 15:03.653
- Well,

15:04.510 --> 15:05.610
I didn't say that, but

15:07.678 --> 15:09.550
I just said that I had an idea.

15:16.796 --> 15:18.350
Hey, sexy.

15:20.575 --> 15:21.810
(Elaine shushes)

15:21.810 --> 15:25.160
Relax, this is the gayborhood.

15:25.160 --> 15:27.630
Besides, the straight
ones like girl-on-girl

15:27.630 --> 15:28.463
more than we do.

15:29.418 --> 15:34.150
- Oh my God, you're terrible.

15:36.690 --> 15:38.930
But I do want to ask you something.

15:39.880 --> 15:41.150
- Shoot.

15:41.150 --> 15:45.460
- Okay, so, you helped me (clears throat)

15:45.460 --> 15:48.520
work out some real frustration yesterday.

15:49.880 --> 15:51.770
- I noticed.

15:51.770 --> 15:54.680
And thank you, by the way; it was

15:56.420 --> 16:00.300
pretty great, actually.
(both chuckle)

16:01.270 --> 16:05.300
- But that isn't really
me, so I have to ask,

16:06.270 --> 16:09.460
are you in it for the
long term or just the fun?

16:10.900 --> 16:12.460
- Why?

16:12.460 --> 16:16.990
- 'Cause I like you, and I
just don't wanna waste my time

16:16.990 --> 16:18.430
with something meaningless.

16:20.805 --> 16:22.480
- A person can grow to like meaningless.

16:22.480 --> 16:23.890
- Please be serious.

16:23.890 --> 16:26.460
I am, for better or
worse, a serious person.

16:26.460 --> 16:30.010
I take my life, my
career, my relationships--

16:30.010 --> 16:30.843
- Seriously.

16:31.858 --> 16:32.691
Yes?

16:32.691 --> 16:33.524
- Yes.

16:34.390 --> 16:38.150
- Elaine, we've only seen each other once.

16:39.230 --> 16:41.510
It takes a lot more than that

16:41.510 --> 16:43.310
to know if you want to fully commit.

16:46.380 --> 16:47.870
- Yeah, I guess so.

16:51.120 --> 16:53.570
But do you wanna meet my friends?

16:54.660 --> 16:56.820
- Sure, yeah, no problem.

16:56.820 --> 16:57.653
Eventually--

16:57.653 --> 17:00.120
- Great, 'cause they asked
me to hang out this weekend.

17:10.078 --> 17:13.494
(bright indie-pop music)

17:14.795 --> 17:16.795
- Hi guys!
- How are you?

17:17.917 --> 17:19.156
- Good to see you.

17:19.156 --> 17:20.998
How are you?
- Hi, come in.

17:20.998 --> 17:22.836
- So guys, this is Poppy.

17:22.836 --> 17:24.508
- How are you?
- Hi.

17:24.508 --> 17:26.425
- Come on in, you guys.

17:46.281 --> 17:47.760
(Elaine sighs contentedly)

17:47.760 --> 17:49.680
Look at how adorable they are together.

17:51.790 --> 17:52.623
- Yes.

17:53.730 --> 17:55.380
Disgustingly so.

17:59.019 --> 18:00.917
(Elaine sighs)

18:00.917 --> 18:02.340
- You know, I think they
found a whole new way

18:02.340 --> 18:03.390
of loving each other.

18:06.060 --> 18:10.433
- If we all claim to do it as
it has never been done before,

18:10.433 --> 18:13.470
I just don't know how people
are gonna do it in the future.

18:15.670 --> 18:17.010
- So Poppy, we figured we'd cook you

18:17.010 --> 18:18.600
one of our specials for dinner.

18:19.450 --> 18:20.283
- Which is?

18:20.283 --> 18:21.116
- Roast chicken...

18:21.116 --> 18:21.949
- Polenta...

18:21.949 --> 18:23.535
- Mushrooms...

18:23.535 --> 18:25.810
- And red Italian peppers!

18:25.810 --> 18:27.300
But first, darling, come.

18:27.300 --> 18:28.390
Let's show them our new place.

18:28.390 --> 18:29.223
- Yes!

18:31.000 --> 18:33.160
- So, Elaine, how did you meet Poppy?

18:33.160 --> 18:35.370
- Um, well...

18:36.380 --> 18:38.560
- You've been in love, of course?

18:38.560 --> 18:40.830
If you haven't, you've got it to come.

18:40.830 --> 18:43.050
Love's like the measles.

18:43.050 --> 18:45.200
Everybody has to get it once,

18:45.200 --> 18:48.730
but you needn't be afraid of
catching it a second time.

18:55.477 --> 18:58.440
In fact, the woman who has had it

18:58.440 --> 19:02.445
can go into the most dangerous
places with perfect safety.

19:02.445 --> 19:03.990
(gentle, nostalgic music)

19:03.990 --> 19:06.780
She can keep her head through
the whirl of a close dance,

19:06.780 --> 19:08.880
catching nothing more lasting than a cold.

19:11.600 --> 19:14.840
She can look into sunny
eyes and not be dazzled.

19:20.270 --> 19:25.023
No, we never sicken with love twice.

19:25.023 --> 19:26.580
(bright indie-pop music)

19:26.580 --> 19:27.900
- Garlic, please.

19:27.900 --> 19:28.950
- Of course, my love.

19:29.840 --> 19:30.710
Pepper, please.

19:30.710 --> 19:32.440
- Certainly, darling.

19:32.440 --> 19:34.670
So, I think everything
will survive in there

19:34.670 --> 19:35.503
while we have a drink.

19:35.503 --> 19:36.610
- Thanks.

19:36.610 --> 19:37.590
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

19:37.590 --> 19:40.350
- So, Poppy, what are your intentions

19:40.350 --> 19:42.330
with our lovely Elaine?

19:42.330 --> 19:44.030
- My intentions?
- Mm-hmm.

19:44.030 --> 19:47.629
- Well, I think, lots of wild, kinky sex,

19:47.629 --> 19:48.462
(Elaine sputters)

19:48.462 --> 19:50.380
and then, you know, just
church her out into the street

19:50.380 --> 19:51.710
when I get bored.
(Elaine coughs)

19:51.710 --> 19:53.270
- Mm-hmm.

19:53.270 --> 19:54.540
- Thanks.

19:54.540 --> 19:56.570
- So, you're not looking for love?

19:58.180 --> 19:59.730
- Mm, I don't know, maybe.

20:01.480 --> 20:04.120
It's all very complicated, isn't it?

20:04.120 --> 20:05.380
You know, being in love.

20:05.380 --> 20:06.220
- I know.

20:06.220 --> 20:07.820
We used to fight all the time,

20:07.820 --> 20:08.820
but it's better now.

20:10.122 --> 20:12.090
- Our love really sustains us now.

20:12.090 --> 20:14.280
- [Lucy] Well, what else is there?

20:14.280 --> 20:16.620
- And if you don't have
someone special in your life,

20:16.620 --> 20:19.780
you might end up like Loretta,
nagging everyone to death.

20:19.780 --> 20:22.610
- Oh now, I doubt Loretta will
ever catch Poppy in her web.

20:22.610 --> 20:24.384
- You can bet on it.

20:24.384 --> 20:25.250
(pot bubbling)

20:25.250 --> 20:26.800
- Ooh, water's boiled.

20:26.800 --> 20:27.750
Time for stage two.

20:33.103 --> 20:36.337
- They have such a great relationship

20:36.337 --> 20:37.420
- Mm, mm-hmm.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.230
I can see that.

20:40.230 --> 20:43.260
- And it's all based on honesty,

20:44.350 --> 20:47.090
about their past, about
the future that they want,

20:48.757 --> 20:50.760
about their goals, everything.

20:53.600 --> 20:56.200
(Elaine sighs)

20:56.200 --> 20:57.810
(Poppy sighs)

20:57.810 --> 21:00.750
- So there's Elaine, covered head-to-foot

21:00.750 --> 21:04.220
in bright green vomit, and
that's when my mother shows up.

21:04.220 --> 21:05.413
- Okay.

21:05.413 --> 21:06.803
I think it's that time again,

21:06.803 --> 21:08.770
I need to get up early
in the morning for work.

21:08.770 --> 21:11.550
- [Lucy] Hey, Poppy,
what do you do for work?

21:11.550 --> 21:12.900
- Oh, I work from home.

21:15.114 --> 21:16.300
I'm still usually late.

21:16.300 --> 21:17.400
- Better get going, then.

21:17.400 --> 21:20.200
Especially if you have all
that kinky sex to have first.

21:21.210 --> 21:22.380
I'm just saying!

21:26.927 --> 21:28.510
- What, are you switching to juice?

21:30.300 --> 21:31.850
- Should we tell them the news?

21:33.050 --> 21:33.883
- Go on, then.

21:35.190 --> 21:36.640
- We're going to have a baby.

21:39.450 --> 21:40.283
- Oh my God.

21:41.414 --> 21:42.414
That's so wonderful!

21:43.390 --> 21:44.376
Oh my God!

21:44.376 --> 21:45.265
Come here!

21:45.265 --> 21:46.890
Congratulations!
- Thank you!

21:49.940 --> 21:53.900
- In reality, even those
who seize love's opportunity

21:53.900 --> 21:55.600
will have to deal with its waning.

21:56.620 --> 21:59.480
We take all things in a
minor key as we grow older:

21:59.480 --> 22:01.780
ambition takes a lower aim,

22:01.780 --> 22:06.720
honor becomes more reasonable,
and love, love dies.

22:08.030 --> 22:10.440
A young couple cannot call to
mind any middle-aged people

22:10.440 --> 22:12.360
that exhibit such frantic attachment,

22:12.360 --> 22:15.970
but that does not interfere
with their belief in themselves.

22:17.636 --> 22:18.510
(chuckles) No.

22:19.890 --> 22:23.850
No one ever loved as they
love, and so, of course,

22:23.850 --> 22:26.840
the rest of the world can
be no guide in their case.

22:31.240 --> 22:35.269
We do not hate, nor grieve, nor joy,

22:35.269 --> 22:36.670
(thunder rumbles)

22:36.670 --> 22:40.210
nor despair in our maturity
like we did in our youth.

22:44.294 --> 22:46.513
(thunder booms)

22:46.513 --> 22:50.430
(cellphone plays message tone)

22:56.254 --> 22:58.754
(Poppy sighs)

23:10.998 --> 23:13.200
(Poppy sighs)

23:13.200 --> 23:14.400
Now into the lion's den.

23:15.457 --> 23:18.790
(ominous ambient music)

23:30.930 --> 23:31.763
- Coffee?

23:41.614 --> 23:46.520
- Look, I understand, okay,
but it has to be done.

23:46.520 --> 23:48.070
Alright, lovely, goodbye.

23:49.694 --> 23:50.740
Hi, Poppy.

23:50.740 --> 23:52.230
Come on, let's go sit at my desk.

23:57.020 --> 24:00.320
Now, Poppy, we need to
talk about productivity.

24:00.320 --> 24:01.153
- Productivity?

24:02.094 --> 24:03.100
- Yes.
- Whose?

24:03.100 --> 24:03.933
- Yours.

24:03.933 --> 24:04.910
Definitely yours.

24:06.190 --> 24:07.023
- I see.

24:07.023 --> 24:08.910
- Listen, Poppy, I like you, 'kay?

24:08.910 --> 24:11.120
And I really like your writing,

24:11.120 --> 24:13.820
but you haven't been a
big moneymaker for me.

24:14.840 --> 24:16.457
You see where I'm going with this?

24:16.457 --> 24:17.290
- Maybe.

24:18.190 --> 24:20.750
- I can't sell your
work if there isn't any.

24:23.120 --> 24:23.953
- Makes sense.

24:23.953 --> 24:27.720
- Basifcally, if you don't
have something finished

24:27.720 --> 24:30.550
in three months, I cannot
represent you anymore.

24:34.141 --> 24:35.090
- Ah.

24:35.090 --> 24:36.330
- Yeah, "Ah."

24:36.330 --> 24:38.650
Now, I don't want to leave you,

24:38.650 --> 24:40.200
so I'm gonna get you some help.

24:41.880 --> 24:43.500
- Oh, good.

24:43.500 --> 24:44.850
- Patsy here.

24:44.850 --> 24:46.350
She's gonna oversee your work.

24:47.280 --> 24:48.150
- Her?

24:48.150 --> 24:50.400
- Listen, I do not hae
time to babysit you,

24:50.400 --> 24:51.900
but Patsy here, she can do it!

24:52.960 --> 24:54.160
- Oh.

24:54.160 --> 24:54.993
Great.

25:01.430 --> 25:03.600
- So, I've prepared a
writing schedule for you.

25:03.600 --> 25:04.940
- Really?

25:04.940 --> 25:06.460
I love writing schedules.

25:06.460 --> 25:08.920
- Good, because you owe me
a synopsis by next Friday

25:08.920 --> 25:10.920
and 1,000 words by the end of next week.

25:14.760 --> 25:15.593
- This Friday?

25:16.890 --> 25:17.723
- This Friday.

25:18.940 --> 25:20.340
I'm sure it'll be wonderful.

25:43.140 --> 25:43.973
- Fuck.

25:46.897 --> 25:49.280
(heartfelt acoustic-guitar music)

25:49.280 --> 25:52.150
- [Elaine] Hi hon, I was
just thinking about you

25:52.150 --> 25:53.580
and I...

25:53.580 --> 25:54.910
And we...

25:54.910 --> 25:57.930
We're heading towards
something permanent, aren't we?

25:57.930 --> 25:59.710
I'd just like to know.

25:59.710 --> 26:01.080
Anyways, speak soon.

26:01.080 --> 26:01.913
Bye.

26:03.300 --> 26:05.780
Oh, and I have a job interview tomorrow,

26:05.780 --> 26:08.180
so if you'd like to call and wish me luck,

26:08.180 --> 26:09.390
that would be nice.

26:09.390 --> 26:10.223
Okay.

26:10.223 --> 26:11.056
Bye.

26:16.115 --> 26:18.615
(Poppy sighs)

26:38.160 --> 26:38.993
- Oh.

26:40.391 --> 26:41.224
Shit.

26:48.950 --> 26:51.180
- So, let me get this straight.

26:51.180 --> 26:53.200
You want to write a guide

26:53.200 --> 26:55.490
to faking a long-term relationship?

26:56.740 --> 26:57.573
- Yes.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.020
- (chuckles) That has got
to be about the most evil

27:01.020 --> 27:03.020
and twisted thing I have ever heard of.

27:04.771 --> 27:05.604
- I know, right?

27:07.734 --> 27:08.911
- It's gonna make us a fortune.

27:08.911 --> 27:10.653
(Angela and Poppy squeal)

27:10.653 --> 27:11.653
Bravo!
- Yes!

27:13.195 --> 27:16.310
(crowd chatters)

27:16.310 --> 27:18.980
- It's one of the chief
curiosities of summer,

27:18.980 --> 27:21.430
the way everyone comes
out wearing bright colors.

27:25.340 --> 27:26.680
Although it is nice to be able

27:26.680 --> 27:28.940
to see some people a long way off.

27:30.437 --> 27:32.300
(menacing orchestral music)

27:32.300 --> 27:33.133
Sorry.

27:46.320 --> 27:47.190
Ah!

27:47.190 --> 27:49.210
- I was hoping to run into you.

27:49.210 --> 27:50.210
- Oh, really?

27:50.210 --> 27:51.043
- Yes!

27:51.043 --> 27:52.020
I'm still looking for volunteers

27:52.020 --> 27:53.984
for my neighborhood committee.

27:53.984 --> 27:54.817
- Oh.

27:54.817 --> 27:55.850
I'm sure that you are.

27:55.850 --> 27:59.170
- But don't you understand
what this means to people?

27:59.170 --> 28:03.210
- I'm sure that I understand
what the word volunteer means.

28:03.210 --> 28:05.650
- Oh, pardon me, I have
to speak to Dennis.

28:06.630 --> 28:07.780
Hello, Dennis.

28:10.060 --> 28:11.560
- (chuckles) Good public works?

28:11.560 --> 28:13.410
Hardly the domain of the idle person.

28:15.493 --> 28:18.984
(enigmatic instrumental music)

28:18.984 --> 28:22.317
(person knocks on door)

28:23.817 --> 28:26.317
(door creaks)

28:27.934 --> 28:29.650
- Um, hello?

28:33.395 --> 28:34.445
It's Elaine Williams.

28:37.374 --> 28:39.624
I'm here about our
appointment at 10 o'clock?

28:51.370 --> 28:52.203
Hello?

28:54.240 --> 28:55.130
It's Elaine.

28:57.529 --> 28:58.970
I'm here about the job interview?

29:00.777 --> 29:02.430
- [Assistant] She's not gonna get it.

29:02.430 --> 29:05.920
She's not gonna get it,
you'll have to go for it!

29:05.920 --> 29:09.000
- Behold!
(Elaine shrieks)

29:10.810 --> 29:11.643
Behold!

29:13.560 --> 29:14.393
- Behold what?

29:15.430 --> 29:17.350
- Behold The Great Ramon!

29:23.290 --> 29:24.123
Wait right here.

29:25.754 --> 29:26.954
I have to go and change.

29:34.178 --> 29:35.255
- Why do you have the box?

29:35.255 --> 29:36.088
- [Ramon] Just get me out of this.

29:36.088 --> 29:37.510
Get rid of the box, this is stupid!

29:37.510 --> 29:38.343
I told you--

29:38.343 --> 29:39.880
- [Assistant] What are you doing?

29:39.880 --> 29:43.820
- [Ramon] Close the curtains!

29:43.820 --> 29:45.150
Where are my other pants?

29:45.150 --> 29:45.983
- [Assistant] Just...

29:45.983 --> 29:46.816
Here, they're ready.

29:46.816 --> 29:47.900
Take this off.

29:47.900 --> 29:48.733
- [Ramon] Okay.

29:48.733 --> 29:49.860
No, the sparkly ones!

29:49.860 --> 29:51.010
- [Assistant] These are the sparkly ones!

29:51.010 --> 29:52.390
- [Ramon] No, I mean
the really sparkly ones!

29:52.390 --> 29:54.350
- [Assistant] You never told
me about the sparkly ones!

29:54.350 --> 29:56.569
- [Ramon] Well I, just
shut up and help me change.

29:56.569 --> 29:59.348
- [Assistant] Here, here, unbutton.

29:59.348 --> 30:01.906
- [Ramon] It's just like
Belgium all over again.

30:01.906 --> 30:03.969
- [Assistant] How'd you get into this?

30:03.969 --> 30:05.190
- [Ramon] I slide in.

30:06.540 --> 30:09.510
- So, I understand you're
looking for an event planner?

30:10.770 --> 30:12.220
- [Ramon] Yes.

30:12.220 --> 30:14.180
I have a major show coming up.

30:15.045 --> 30:16.190
(Elaine clears throat)

30:16.190 --> 30:19.320
- Well, that's just my
thing; what's it called?

30:21.040 --> 30:22.204
- Delusion.
(Elaine screams)

30:22.204 --> 30:24.871
(Ramon screams)

30:26.016 --> 30:30.400
(Ramon cries)
Oh my God, I am so sorry.

30:31.290 --> 30:33.060
- Don't worry about it too much.

30:33.060 --> 30:35.190
This isn't the first time it's happened.

30:39.686 --> 30:43.616
(cellphone plays ringtone)

30:43.616 --> 30:45.090
- Hello?

30:45.090 --> 30:46.800
- [Patsy] It's Patsy.

30:46.800 --> 30:47.690
- Oh, hi.

30:48.590 --> 30:51.090
- [Patsy] Angela suggested you
need some professional help.

30:51.090 --> 30:53.180
- (chuckles) Oh, really?

30:53.180 --> 30:54.570
- [Patsy] But apparently,
she's seeking something

30:54.570 --> 30:56.270
different than me.

30:56.270 --> 30:58.620
She wants you to see a
relationship counselor.

30:58.620 --> 31:01.480
You know, to find out how a
proper relationship works.

31:03.630 --> 31:04.920
- Have you ever wondered how much trouble

31:04.920 --> 31:07.420
you'd really get into if
you punched a 10-year-old?

31:11.223 --> 31:13.973
(knocks on door)

31:16.242 --> 31:17.964
- [Man] Come on, you bastard!

31:17.964 --> 31:19.570
- Um, hello?

31:19.570 --> 31:20.403
- [Man] What?

31:21.462 --> 31:22.380
Who is it?

31:23.740 --> 31:24.573
- Poppy.

31:25.804 --> 31:28.230
Angela recommended you to me.

31:29.170 --> 31:30.550
- Oh.

31:30.550 --> 31:32.120
Hi, Hugo.

31:32.120 --> 31:32.953
- Poppy.

31:36.102 --> 31:37.455
(Hugo grunts)

31:37.455 --> 31:38.620
(Hugo breathes heavily)

31:38.620 --> 31:41.270
- What was it that Angela
wanted me to help you with?

31:42.160 --> 31:44.510
- I wanan know how to fake
a long-term relationship.

31:47.080 --> 31:47.913
- Right.

31:52.563 --> 31:55.473
(fridge clatters)

31:55.473 --> 31:57.906
(Hugo groans)

31:57.906 --> 31:59.390
(fridge bangs)

31:59.390 --> 32:02.920
Poppy, I'm a relationship counselr.

32:02.920 --> 32:05.440
I don't normally recommend
fake relationships;

32:05.440 --> 32:08.500
in fact, I usually recommend
you don't ever allow yourself

32:08.500 --> 32:12.110
to get involved in that
situation in the first place.

32:12.110 --> 32:13.210
- Yeah.

32:13.210 --> 32:14.370
Sure, of course.

32:15.520 --> 32:19.390
But, what if someone really needed to?

32:19.390 --> 32:21.790
Like, for their career or something?

32:21.790 --> 32:23.730
- Well, it's still a bad idea.

32:24.800 --> 32:29.570
A better idea is to embrace
a real relationship.

32:29.570 --> 32:30.880
Even if you don't like the person

32:30.880 --> 32:33.560
or they're particularly awkward,

32:33.560 --> 32:35.620
or especially if it is someone

32:35.620 --> 32:38.460
who can have significant
influence on your future.

32:39.490 --> 32:41.240
- Okay. (chuckles)

32:41.240 --> 32:42.100
But what--

32:42.100 --> 32:43.590
- Ah ah ah!

32:43.590 --> 32:46.170
"Real, good; fake, bad.

32:46.170 --> 32:47.003
"Capisce?"

32:48.070 --> 32:48.903
- Okay.

32:51.060 --> 32:53.740
Can you just tell me how
relationships are formed?

32:56.890 --> 32:59.400
- So, you want me to
create your launch event?

33:00.430 --> 33:01.263
- Yes.

33:01.263 --> 33:02.096
- I can do that.

33:02.096 --> 33:02.929
- Great, you're hired.

33:02.929 --> 33:04.410
- But--
- She's hired.

33:04.410 --> 33:06.140
- I'm tired of re-wrapping that damn box

33:06.140 --> 33:07.490
and we're running out of time.

33:07.490 --> 33:09.250
- You won't regret it.

33:09.250 --> 33:11.410
I will put together
the greatest guest list

33:11.410 --> 33:12.390
you have ever seen.

33:13.320 --> 33:16.160
Okay, so, what is this event about?

33:16.160 --> 33:17.700
What is The Delusion?

33:21.970 --> 33:22.870
- Okay.

33:22.870 --> 33:24.200
Now, listen up.

33:25.420 --> 33:29.960
Relationships tend to go
through three main stages:

33:29.960 --> 33:33.970
forming, storming, performing.

33:35.100 --> 33:37.410
In the first stage, you
find somebody attractive

33:37.410 --> 33:39.930
in some, possibly many, ways.

33:40.940 --> 33:45.940
Now, at this point you need
to be nice to that someone

33:46.720 --> 33:51.720
so that they want to be around you too.

33:53.030 --> 33:54.513
- Right, got it.

33:54.513 --> 33:55.963
(clicks tongue) Nice is good.

33:56.870 --> 33:57.750
- Nice is good.

33:58.800 --> 34:00.860
Second stage: storming.

34:00.860 --> 34:03.780
This is where your inevitable
differences show up

34:03.780 --> 34:07.348
and you are arguing like
cats and dogs, okay?

34:07.348 --> 34:09.580
Now, you're all like, "Wah wah wah,"

34:09.580 --> 34:12.830
and they're, "Meh te
deh," and you are fighting

34:12.830 --> 34:15.290
a deep-seated need to strangle them,

34:16.550 --> 34:20.500
cut them into little pieces,
and bury them in the garden.

34:23.219 --> 34:24.053
- Right.

34:25.659 --> 34:26.900
- Right.

34:26.900 --> 34:27.733
Right?

34:27.733 --> 34:31.254
And the reason that these
arguments cut so deeply,

34:31.254 --> 34:33.080
(chuckles) no pun intended,

34:33.080 --> 34:35.650
is because they challenge
your personality,

34:35.650 --> 34:39.139
your self-image, your future plans.

34:39.139 --> 34:41.730
I mean, you thought that
this person was attractive,

34:41.730 --> 34:44.699
now you find out that you
are fundamentally different,

34:44.699 --> 34:46.060
which is terrible!

34:46.060 --> 34:46.960
It's a disaster!

34:48.154 --> 34:49.159
But it's normal.

34:51.360 --> 34:52.960
- Okay.

34:52.960 --> 34:53.920
Sure, yeah.

34:53.920 --> 34:57.220
So, normal to hate the
person that you love.

34:57.220 --> 34:58.190
Got it.

34:58.190 --> 34:59.360
- Absolutely.

34:59.360 --> 35:02.760
And the intensity of
the arguments correlates

35:02.760 --> 35:04.700
with the deepness of the relationship,

35:04.700 --> 35:08.420
so deeply-felt relationships
will have angrier,

35:08.420 --> 35:09.590
more intense arguments.

35:11.280 --> 35:12.860
- I see.

35:12.860 --> 35:15.480
- Stage three: performing.

35:15.480 --> 35:16.900
Okay, now this is where, hopefully,

35:16.900 --> 35:18.710
you have worked through your differences

35:18.710 --> 35:22.060
and reconciled them, or, if not, at least

35:23.370 --> 35:27.060
brought together the
differences in thinking

35:27.060 --> 35:28.300
to a manageable level.

35:28.300 --> 35:30.580
This is the dreaded compromise stage

35:30.580 --> 35:33.300
that every marriage is based on.

35:33.300 --> 35:34.940
- Right.

35:34.940 --> 35:38.080
And what's the importance
of the performing?

35:38.080 --> 35:39.460
Long term?

35:39.460 --> 35:40.910
- Well, happiness, hopefully.

35:41.890 --> 35:42.960
- Hm.

35:42.960 --> 35:44.160
But it's not excitement.

35:45.570 --> 35:47.580
- Not so much as in the beginning.

35:47.580 --> 35:52.580
May not be scintillating,
but there is love, respect;

35:53.010 --> 35:57.690
I mean, there's warm
memories of past challenges

35:57.690 --> 35:58.990
and shared experiences.

36:00.380 --> 36:02.380
- Sounds a little dull, don't you think?

36:03.380 --> 36:04.490
- Dull, but happy.

36:05.920 --> 36:07.460
- Only if it lasts.

36:09.420 --> 36:10.310
And, well,

36:12.309 --> 36:13.830
it never lasts.

36:20.380 --> 36:21.290
- And?

36:21.290 --> 36:22.750
How was your job interview?

36:24.310 --> 36:25.840
- Different.

36:25.840 --> 36:27.500
He's an artist.

36:27.500 --> 36:29.001
Concept artist.

36:29.001 --> 36:30.920
- Mm, what does that mean?

36:30.920 --> 36:32.320
- (chuckles) God only knows.

36:33.600 --> 36:36.320
- Alright, well, when do you find out?

36:36.320 --> 36:38.470
- Oh, no, I got the job.

36:38.470 --> 36:41.200
I'm just wondering what the
hell I let myself in for.

36:43.206 --> 36:44.039
How was your day?

36:46.370 --> 36:47.870
- Lots of background research.

36:49.820 --> 36:51.600
I've come up with my tactical plan.

36:52.705 --> 36:56.955
(light, catchy instrumental music)

37:14.390 --> 37:15.780
Fight one,

37:15.780 --> 37:17.230
fight two,

37:17.230 --> 37:18.170
fight three.

37:18.170 --> 37:20.250
Oh, that's not gonna work.

37:20.250 --> 37:22.270
They're all Fridays,

37:22.270 --> 37:24.590
but make-up sex is good for Saturdays.

37:25.600 --> 37:27.320
Now, what to fight about?

37:30.470 --> 37:31.980
Politics?

37:33.363 --> 37:34.340
Money.

37:35.827 --> 37:36.660
Faith.

37:39.770 --> 37:41.980
Self-help books.

37:46.920 --> 37:48.120
It's not much of a list.

37:49.505 --> 37:51.010
I'll have to come up
with something better.

37:52.830 --> 37:55.890
Lovers have more power for good
or evil than they dream of.

37:57.310 --> 37:59.580
Unconcsiously, you mold yourself

37:59.580 --> 38:01.960
to what she would have
you be, good or bad.

38:03.230 --> 38:06.400
After all, what noble
deeds were we not ripe for

38:06.400 --> 38:07.700
in the days when we loved?

38:09.004 --> 38:11.830
It was no mere human creature
like ourselves that we adored,

38:11.830 --> 38:14.550
it was a queen that we paid homage to,

38:14.550 --> 38:16.210
a goddess that we worshiped!

38:19.158 --> 38:19.991
Aww.

38:19.991 --> 38:24.220
Those foolish days when we
were unselfish and pure-minded.

38:27.660 --> 38:31.580
And oh, these wise and
clever days when we know

38:31.580 --> 38:34.730
that money is the only
prize worth striving for,

38:36.160 --> 38:38.120
when we chase only passing thrills.

38:39.430 --> 38:40.680
These days take us over.

38:41.919 --> 38:46.169
(light, catchy instrumental music)

39:00.902 --> 39:02.900
It's working out rather well.

39:02.900 --> 39:06.360
But, I think it might
be time for an argument.

39:10.730 --> 39:12.930
Did you use up the last
of my whipped cream?

39:13.940 --> 39:16.400
- Yes, which is why I got you some more.

39:19.320 --> 39:20.153
- Oh.

39:21.630 --> 39:23.710
- Besides, I'm surprised
you could even tell,

39:23.710 --> 39:24.630
given the mess.

39:35.682 --> 39:36.515
Hm.

39:36.515 --> 39:39.310
That cheese gonna walk
out on its own accord.

39:39.310 --> 39:41.560
Get a job, start a family,

39:41.560 --> 39:43.560
maybe even start a retirement plan.

39:48.300 --> 39:50.820
Oh, and are you planning
on washing or ironing

39:50.820 --> 39:54.040
any of these clothes, or are
you happy walking around town

39:54.040 --> 39:57.450
looking like a brightly-colored scrotum?

39:57.450 --> 39:58.840
- [Poppy] Scrotum?

39:58.840 --> 40:02.230
- Something wrinkly and unpleasant anyway.

40:02.230 --> 40:04.790
- Oh, oh, and you're perfect, are you?

40:04.790 --> 40:07.600
- Oh, I keep nice and tidy, yes.

40:07.600 --> 40:09.740
I try not to look like I'm homeless.

40:14.233 --> 40:17.566
(Poppy breathes deeply)

40:24.390 --> 40:25.590
Do your worst.

40:28.334 --> 40:30.917
(Elaine gasps)

40:34.520 --> 40:35.353
- [Poppy] Don't you dare!

40:35.353 --> 40:36.480
- Oh, stop me.

40:37.440 --> 40:39.340
- Don't you dare.

41:03.310 --> 41:05.980
(gasps) Oh!

41:05.980 --> 41:08.150
Oh, it is on now, slut!

41:09.044 --> 41:12.294
(thrilling rock music)

41:32.266 --> 41:35.683
(both breathing heavily)

41:46.463 --> 41:47.430
- Hey Poppy honey, I want you to know

41:47.430 --> 41:49.762
we are really on a roll here.

41:49.762 --> 41:50.640
I mean, your new girlfriend's really

41:50.640 --> 41:52.140
bringing something out of you.

41:53.060 --> 41:55.180
Yeah, and who knows, maybe
when we're ready to launch,

41:55.180 --> 41:57.322
we can have her do an event?

41:57.322 --> 41:59.739
(Patsy gags)

42:00.769 --> 42:05.686
(affectionate, cherished orchestral music)

42:15.361 --> 42:17.180
- What do you think?

42:17.180 --> 42:18.347
- It's pretty.

42:21.378 --> 42:23.650
I don't know if I'd get up
for it regularly, though.

42:24.717 --> 42:26.216
- You were pretty awake this morning.

42:26.216 --> 42:27.910
- Mm, yes, I know.

42:29.060 --> 42:30.170
It was most odd.

42:36.284 --> 42:37.867
- What do you want?

42:39.547 --> 42:41.000
- To go back to bed, I think.

42:42.154 --> 42:42.987
- (chuckles) No.

42:44.322 --> 42:45.600
I mean, what do you want out of life?

42:52.334 --> 42:53.284
- I wanna be happy.

42:56.370 --> 42:59.590
I want my friends to be happy;

43:02.767 --> 43:05.320
if I had one, I'd want
my family to be happy.

43:09.844 --> 43:11.780
I haven't got much further than that.

43:11.780 --> 43:12.980
- You forgot about Zeus.

43:12.980 --> 43:17.683
- (chuckles) Give him a ball
to chase and a leg to hump,

43:17.683 --> 43:18.870
and he's good.

43:24.570 --> 43:25.403
- So,

43:29.748 --> 43:30.581
do you,

43:32.090 --> 43:34.350
do you think we should move in together?

43:38.227 --> 43:39.330
- Um,

43:42.240 --> 43:43.073
maybe.

43:44.170 --> 43:45.003
- Good.

43:45.887 --> 43:47.220
I'll start searching.

43:51.647 --> 43:56.147
(moody, throbbing instrumental music)

44:02.840 --> 44:03.920
- Damn it!

44:03.920 --> 44:05.670
Hugo, what have you gotten me into?

44:06.839 --> 44:09.120
- [Hugo] Excuse me, but what have I done?

44:09.120 --> 44:10.500
- What have you done?

44:10.500 --> 44:12.050
What have you done?

44:12.050 --> 44:15.306
Oh, oh, I will tell you what you've done.

44:15.306 --> 44:17.700
It is working so well, she
wants to move in together!

44:17.700 --> 44:18.900
That's what you've done!

44:20.343 --> 44:22.343
(sighs)

44:24.280 --> 44:25.630
I'm comfortable in my home.

44:27.320 --> 44:31.750
All my old trinkets to meet
me whenever I glance up.

44:33.641 --> 44:35.841
All my little knick-knacks
spread around me.

44:36.691 --> 44:38.680
(passive, joyless piano music)

44:38.680 --> 44:41.240
Photos of the girls I've
loved up on the mantelpiece.

44:43.134 --> 44:45.484
A couple of disreputable
pipes scattered about.

44:47.736 --> 44:49.736
(sighs)

44:50.710 --> 44:55.460
Familiar pictures to hide
the stains on the walls.

44:58.240 --> 45:01.240
My books, higgledy-piggledy
all over the place.

45:06.340 --> 45:08.680
Even the stains themselves are memories.

45:11.732 --> 45:13.894
(person knocking on door)

45:13.894 --> 45:16.394
(Poppy sighs)

45:21.120 --> 45:22.720
- Ready to go apartment hunting?

45:24.490 --> 45:25.323
- Sure.

45:27.234 --> 45:31.901
(delicate, troubled instrumental music)

45:34.080 --> 45:35.080
- What do you think?

45:36.814 --> 45:39.030
(Poppy groans)

45:39.030 --> 45:41.730
- New furniture has no charm,
compared with old stuff.

45:43.912 --> 45:45.040
- (sighs) Come on.

45:49.280 --> 45:51.760
- It's the old things that we love.

45:51.760 --> 45:55.790
Old faces, old books, old jokes.

45:58.275 --> 46:00.275
(sighs)

46:02.480 --> 46:03.850
- So, here it is.

46:03.850 --> 46:05.340
- Okay, let's have a look around.

46:10.550 --> 46:13.250
- And not merely old in itself.

46:13.250 --> 46:15.150
Apartment furniture generally is that.

46:16.290 --> 46:19.210
It must be old to us,

46:19.210 --> 46:23.010
old in recollections and association.

46:27.380 --> 46:29.850
- We weren't expecting it to be furnished.

46:29.850 --> 46:33.830
- Oh, don't worry, it won't
be, after I evict this jackass.

46:33.830 --> 46:36.500
- So, the rent?

46:36.500 --> 46:39.330
- [Landlord] $1,600,
like it says in the ad.

46:39.330 --> 46:41.260
No negotiation.

46:41.260 --> 46:42.400
- Not even a little?

46:42.400 --> 46:44.850
- [Landlord] I used to
get $1,750 for this place!

46:45.900 --> 46:46.733
- Oh.

46:46.733 --> 46:48.040
- [Landlord] And $1,900 before that.

46:48.040 --> 46:50.570
- Well, it's a good thing we
didn't come apartment-hunting

46:50.570 --> 46:51.403
five years ago.

46:52.670 --> 46:54.290
It woulda cost us a fortune.

47:26.434 --> 47:27.267
- Oh.

47:27.267 --> 47:28.120
Hello, ladies.

47:28.120 --> 47:29.376
- [Elaine] Hi.

47:29.376 --> 47:30.971
- Hi, I'm Loretta.

47:30.971 --> 47:31.804
I'm from the neighborhood committee.

47:32.640 --> 47:34.340
- I'm Elaine, I'm Poppy's partner.

47:35.290 --> 47:36.409
- (chuckles) Partner?

47:36.409 --> 47:37.790
(light, catchy instrumental music)

47:37.790 --> 47:40.560
Oh, yes, of course, she's my girl!

47:41.416 --> 47:42.630
Of course.

47:42.630 --> 47:44.350
- That's lovely.

47:44.350 --> 47:46.870
I was wondering which one
of the community projects

47:46.870 --> 47:47.880
you would wanna be involved with?

47:47.880 --> 47:50.390
- Oh, no, I don't think we're
gonna have time for that.

47:50.390 --> 47:51.840
- Actually, I think we might.

47:52.854 --> 47:55.394
Poppy, we can make some time, surely.

47:55.394 --> 47:56.800
Loretta, why don't you just come in,

47:56.800 --> 47:57.850
tell us all about it?

47:59.790 --> 48:00.623
- Sure.

48:02.424 --> 48:03.774
If you don't mind the mess.

48:22.390 --> 48:24.230
- You know what, Loretta?

48:24.230 --> 48:25.730
I think Poppy and I might
be able to help you out

48:25.730 --> 48:27.240
with almost all of these.

48:27.240 --> 48:29.067
- Whoa, all of them?

48:29.067 --> 48:30.710
- [Loretta] Well that's fantastic!

48:30.710 --> 48:32.230
Here, write down your email

48:32.230 --> 48:34.070
and I'll start sending you stuff.

48:34.070 --> 48:36.120
- Actually, I'm in the
process of changing my email

48:36.120 --> 48:37.170
at the moment, so...

48:38.270 --> 48:40.730
- In that case Loretta,
you just send it all to me

48:40.730 --> 48:43.430
and I'll make sure Poppy gets it.

48:43.430 --> 48:45.200
- Thank you so much.

48:47.580 --> 48:50.500
Well, I must be off.

48:51.720 --> 48:52.860
- [Elaine] I'll bring you down.

48:52.860 --> 48:53.880
- You going out again?

48:53.880 --> 48:54.713
- Yes.

48:54.713 --> 48:56.420
Unforunately, we spent the entire day

48:56.420 --> 48:58.780
trying to find us a new apartment,

48:58.780 --> 49:03.020
but there was apparently
something wrong with all of them.

49:03.020 --> 49:05.150
All that time, all that effort,

49:05.150 --> 49:07.990
all that research, and nothing was right,

49:07.990 --> 49:12.500
so I'm going to go out
and do some food shopping.

49:16.260 --> 49:17.093
Bye, darling.

49:27.025 --> 49:28.990
- I may have underestimated my opponent.

49:32.490 --> 49:35.630
Well, two can play at that game.

49:38.140 --> 49:41.910
Dear reader, if you are
ever hit by a pang of regret

49:41.910 --> 49:44.770
or even guilt for faking
your relationship,

49:45.768 --> 49:48.090
it always helps to keep
a list of all the things

49:48.090 --> 49:51.590
that your partner does that annoys you.

49:51.590 --> 49:55.180
One: she criticizes your female friends.

49:55.180 --> 49:58.760
Two: every day requires
a 45-minute analysis

49:58.760 --> 50:01.140
of who's annoyed her at work.

50:01.140 --> 50:04.290
Three: you don't need to
wear my clothes obsessively

50:04.290 --> 50:06.870
like you're trying to permanently
mark me with your smell!

50:06.870 --> 50:09.480
I am not a signpost for you to pee on.

50:11.411 --> 50:13.410
(sighs)

50:13.410 --> 50:17.970
22: every morning, your breath smells

50:17.970 --> 50:19.770
like a raccoon's butthole!

50:20.920 --> 50:25.920
And finally, 23: I am
not your emotional crutch

50:26.690 --> 50:29.750
that exists just to confirm
everything you want to do!

50:30.915 --> 50:32.965
If you want to do it, just fucking do it!

50:35.454 --> 50:37.454
(sighs)

50:50.250 --> 50:51.083
- Are we good?

50:52.670 --> 50:53.503
- Yeah.

50:55.140 --> 50:56.200
Yeah, of course.

50:57.841 --> 50:58.850
Of course we're good.

51:01.690 --> 51:03.270
It's just...

51:03.270 --> 51:04.103
- It's just what?

51:06.091 --> 51:07.495
- I just would like to do more things

51:07.495 --> 51:09.260
that I want to do sometimes.

51:10.890 --> 51:12.540
- But I'm not stopping you, am I?

51:14.480 --> 51:17.020
- No, not really.

51:17.020 --> 51:17.990
- Not really?

51:18.910 --> 51:20.660
Well, what is it that you wanna do?

51:23.086 --> 51:24.544
- I dunno, like...

51:24.544 --> 51:27.300
(light, catchy instrumental music)

51:27.300 --> 51:28.690
I dunno, like camping.

51:29.710 --> 51:31.293
- Camping?

51:31.293 --> 51:32.126
(Poppy grunts affirmatively)

51:32.126 --> 51:35.730
Like, a tent, with bugs everywhere,

51:35.730 --> 51:38.450
and bears and mud and stuff?

51:39.320 --> 51:41.920
- Okay (laughs), well
when you put it like that.

51:43.250 --> 51:45.120
- I'm just so busy with Ramon's--

51:45.120 --> 51:46.310
- Hey.

51:46.310 --> 51:50.690
Excuse me, it is The Great Ramon's.

51:50.690 --> 51:52.530
- The Great Ramon's show.

51:54.900 --> 51:57.625
- Anyway, I thought you were
only doing half the show?

51:57.625 --> 51:59.690
- I'm not doing half the
show, I'm doing the full show,

51:59.690 --> 52:02.050
he just hasn't entirely told me

52:02.050 --> 52:04.930
what the main part of the show is.

52:04.930 --> 52:09.930
- Well, that sounds
like half a show to me.

52:11.460 --> 52:14.090
- I invited all my contacts, the press,

52:14.090 --> 52:17.200
my most glamorous professional clients.

52:17.200 --> 52:19.140
It had better be a good bloody show.

52:19.140 --> 52:20.530
Even a former mayor's coming.

52:20.530 --> 52:22.580
- Okay, well maybe you just need a break.

52:35.590 --> 52:36.423
- Um,

52:39.020 --> 52:41.290
well we could...

52:44.200 --> 52:45.530
- Well, forget it.

52:46.446 --> 52:48.130
If you don't like camping,
you don't like camping.

52:49.945 --> 52:51.995
What kind of idiot likes camping anyways?

53:03.710 --> 53:04.543
Hey.

53:04.543 --> 53:05.380
Sorry I'm late.

53:06.371 --> 53:07.390
- Come on, let's go.

53:07.390 --> 53:08.223
Get off.

53:11.376 --> 53:12.610
- [Poppy] What is this place anyways?

53:12.610 --> 53:15.210
- This, Pops, is a publishing house.

53:15.210 --> 53:16.043
- Oh.

53:16.043 --> 53:17.620
- Welcome to Russell and Flo Publishing.

53:17.620 --> 53:19.020
- Although, really, it's just Russell now,

53:19.020 --> 53:21.220
he divorced the cheating slut.

53:21.220 --> 53:24.250
- Ah ah ah ah.

53:26.530 --> 53:28.360
- Nice to meet you at last, Poppy.

53:29.310 --> 53:31.880
- I'm delighted to be here.

53:31.880 --> 53:34.580
- I want you to know
that if you commit to us,

53:34.580 --> 53:36.130
we will commit to you.

53:39.430 --> 53:40.330
- Glad to hear it.

53:41.340 --> 53:43.580
- See, that's the way it has to be, Poppy,

53:43.580 --> 53:47.500
because every time we
take on a new writer,

53:49.810 --> 53:51.760
we essentially bet the company on them.

53:53.850 --> 53:54.683
- Oh.

54:01.330 --> 54:04.770
- So, I've been thinking
about your suggestion.

54:04.770 --> 54:06.740
- Oh, really?

54:06.740 --> 54:08.280
Which one?

54:08.280 --> 54:09.230
- The camping trip.

54:11.100 --> 54:12.310
- Oh, that.

54:12.310 --> 54:13.960
- And I think we should do it.

54:15.230 --> 54:17.280
- Um, this summer?

54:17.280 --> 54:18.750
- Of course.

54:18.750 --> 54:20.150
- Well, are we gonna have time?

54:20.150 --> 54:21.980
- Well, Ramon's event is going great,

54:21.980 --> 54:23.410
it's still a couple of weeks away,

54:23.410 --> 54:25.490
and I mean, you're not
really doing anyth...

54:26.920 --> 54:27.960
Uh, you, um...

54:29.990 --> 54:30.823
You,

54:31.850 --> 54:33.480
you're flexible, right?

54:33.480 --> 54:34.690
- No.

54:34.690 --> 54:35.970
No, I'm not that flexible.

54:35.970 --> 54:38.770
No, I have a writing
schedule and everything.

54:38.770 --> 54:40.820
- And you better stick with it.

54:40.820 --> 54:42.070
- [Elaine] Oh, hi, Patsy!

54:44.920 --> 54:46.380
- Speak of the devil.

54:46.380 --> 54:47.970
- This is actually perfect timing.

54:47.970 --> 54:49.580
Do you think you can maybe give Poppy

54:49.580 --> 54:51.810
a couple of days off her schedule?

54:51.810 --> 54:53.090
- Sorry, no.

54:53.090 --> 54:55.110
It's very important
that the work gets done.

54:55.110 --> 54:56.040
- See, I told you.

54:56.040 --> 54:57.690
I can't get away.

54:57.690 --> 54:59.996
We'll go camping another time.

54:59.996 --> 55:01.620
- Camping?

55:01.620 --> 55:02.920
You like camping?

55:02.920 --> 55:03.850
- I love camping.

55:05.362 --> 55:09.020
- You know what, maybe
I've been too harsh.

55:09.020 --> 55:10.830
- I'm sure that's not true.

55:10.830 --> 55:12.840
You're just being professional.

55:12.840 --> 55:14.150
- I mean, I don't wanna stop you guys

55:14.150 --> 55:16.160
from going camping, especially right now

55:16.160 --> 55:18.900
with all the blazing-hot
sun we've been having.

55:18.900 --> 55:20.000
So I'll tell you what:

55:20.000 --> 55:22.610
I'll shift your writing
schedule by a week.

55:22.610 --> 55:24.460
- Are you sure you can do that?

55:24.460 --> 55:29.040
You know, I mean, without
speaking to Angela first?

55:29.040 --> 55:29.880
- Sure.

55:29.880 --> 55:32.930
In fact, I think this
is the best idea ever.

55:32.930 --> 55:34.130
- Thank you so much!

55:35.650 --> 55:37.520
- Oh, it's my pleasure.

55:37.520 --> 55:38.353
- Poppy, come on.

55:38.353 --> 55:39.270
Let's go get a tent.

55:46.522 --> 55:47.355
(Poppy chuckles)

55:47.355 --> 55:49.510
Okay, we have everything, right?

55:49.510 --> 55:50.900
- And more.

55:50.900 --> 55:52.190
- I mean, it's not like we're going

55:52.190 --> 55:54.150
into the middle of nowhere.

55:54.150 --> 55:55.940
If we need anything, we'll just buy it.

55:56.870 --> 55:58.130
- Sure.

55:58.130 --> 55:59.510
- Okay.

55:59.510 --> 56:00.343
Let's go.

56:04.181 --> 56:08.181
(optimistic instrumental music)

56:36.789 --> 56:37.739
I think we're here.

56:39.090 --> 56:41.750
- We're gonna be walking
mostly from now on, right?

56:51.916 --> 56:52.866
I'll go sign us in.

56:58.502 --> 56:59.650
- Did you find a map?

56:59.650 --> 57:04.390
- I have one map, and a
two-for-one token for ziplining

57:04.390 --> 57:06.190
from the camp counselor.

57:06.190 --> 57:07.023
- Took you a while.

57:07.023 --> 57:08.450
Were you chatting?

57:08.450 --> 57:09.330
- Yes.

57:09.330 --> 57:11.880
I felt like finding an especially novel,

57:11.880 --> 57:13.690
out-of-the-way subject
to talk to him about,

57:13.690 --> 57:16.360
a subject that no one had
ever talked about before,

57:16.360 --> 57:20.270
a subject the discussion
of which will come down

57:20.270 --> 57:23.170
upon the world and stun them,

57:23.170 --> 57:25.940
a topic that will attract by its novelty

57:25.940 --> 57:29.450
and invigorate by its
surprising freshness.

57:29.450 --> 57:30.283
- Which was?

57:31.660 --> 57:33.320
- We talked about the weather.

57:33.320 --> 57:36.320
- Well, I'm glad you found
something so useful to do.

57:36.320 --> 57:38.393
By the way, you're cooking tonight.

57:38.393 --> 57:40.930
- That might not be such a good idea.

57:40.930 --> 57:42.800
Apparently, it's gonna rain.

57:46.057 --> 57:48.724
(Elaine grunts)

57:54.305 --> 57:55.640
Are these seats taken?

57:55.640 --> 57:58.040
- Uh, no, you'll be
alright, you should join us.

58:05.540 --> 58:09.170
And how are you two lovely
ladies doing this evening?

58:09.170 --> 58:12.366
- Mm-mm, sorry boys, you're out of luck.

58:12.366 --> 58:15.200
We drive on the opposite side of the road.

58:15.200 --> 58:16.330
- Yeah, we know.

58:16.330 --> 58:17.884
We saw you drive in.

58:17.884 --> 58:21.051
(Poppy and men laugh)

58:23.345 --> 58:25.297
(group chatters)

58:25.297 --> 58:27.110
- Excuse me, what kind
of wines do you have?

58:27.110 --> 58:29.250
- The usual, red and white.

58:29.250 --> 58:30.900
Actually, we're out of white.

58:30.900 --> 58:31.733
- Oh.

58:31.733 --> 58:32.566
- No, don't worry about it.

58:32.566 --> 58:34.756
Actually, we're gonna
be on the beers tonight.

58:34.756 --> 58:36.310
- Alright!
- Beers.

58:36.310 --> 58:37.143
(Poppy chuckles)

58:37.143 --> 58:37.976
- Cheers.
- All around.

58:37.976 --> 58:38.950
- [Phil] On you, not us.

58:38.950 --> 58:40.770
Our tent is really small.

58:40.770 --> 58:42.518
- Yeah, it's really good.

58:42.518 --> 58:44.940
(Poppy and men talk over each other)

58:44.940 --> 58:46.376
- We're sleeping in that tent together.

58:46.376 --> 58:49.209
(edgy rock music)

58:51.201 --> 58:53.315
(men cheer)

58:53.315 --> 58:56.065
(group chatters)

58:59.096 --> 59:01.846
(Poppy laughing)

59:03.200 --> 59:04.321
- [Elaine] Do you guys sleep naked?

59:04.321 --> 59:05.336
- [Pete] No!

59:05.336 --> 59:07.462
- We are gonna kick your ass.

59:07.462 --> 59:12.462
- [Phil] Go go go go go. (yells)

59:12.863 --> 59:13.696
Sick.

59:15.420 --> 59:16.639
- [Poppy] You gonna make it?

59:16.639 --> 59:18.340
You gonna make it?

59:18.340 --> 59:19.380
- [Phil] It's fine, it's
fine, your forehead's fine.

59:19.380 --> 59:21.795
- [Pete] I hit my head all the time.

59:21.795 --> 59:23.669
- [Poppy] You got it, you got it, Elaine!

59:23.669 --> 59:25.326
- [Pete] Whoa, whoa, she's...

59:25.326 --> 59:27.384
- [Poppy] You should do two
shots, just to show off.

59:27.384 --> 59:28.732
- [Pete] Do two, do two, do two!

59:28.732 --> 59:29.735
Yes!

59:29.735 --> 59:30.914
- You're nuts!
- Yes!

59:30.914 --> 59:32.194
- [Phil] It's fine.

59:32.194 --> 59:33.415
Keep the stick on the ground;

59:33.415 --> 59:34.492
if not, it's illegal.

59:34.492 --> 59:36.492
- [Elaine] You got this.

59:41.954 --> 59:43.730
- [Phil] That looks good, you got it.

59:43.730 --> 59:45.323
Yeah.
(Elaine whoops)

59:45.323 --> 59:47.158
(group talking over each other)

59:47.158 --> 59:49.486
- [Pete] (laughs) I wonder
what she's going for.

59:49.486 --> 59:51.386
- [Phil] Steady.

59:51.386 --> 59:53.026
Yes!
- Don't think about puking.

59:53.026 --> 59:54.518
- Don't think about puking.
(Elaine groans)

59:54.518 --> 59:55.528
- [Pete] Alright!

59:55.528 --> 59:56.680
Carry on!

59:56.680 --> 59:57.763
Sweep! Sweep!

01:00:00.408 --> 01:00:02.947
(men boo)

01:00:02.947 --> 01:00:06.697
(group laughing and talking)

01:00:13.874 --> 01:00:16.916
(Poppy laughs)

01:00:16.916 --> 01:00:19.416
(men hooting)

01:00:20.542 --> 01:00:24.542
(group talking over each other)

01:00:30.046 --> 01:00:30.879
- Oh!

01:00:32.947 --> 01:00:36.568
(cheers) What?

01:00:36.568 --> 01:00:38.147
I win!

01:00:38.147 --> 01:00:38.980
Yes!

01:00:43.290 --> 01:00:45.208
You guys gonna be alright?

01:00:45.208 --> 01:00:48.700
- [Phil] Yeah, I'm just not
gonna let him in the tent.

01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:52.100
He has a genetic
predisposition to diarrhea.

01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:53.600
- [Elaine] That's a good idea.

01:00:54.603 --> 01:00:55.936
Goodnight!
- Bye.

01:00:59.224 --> 01:01:01.807
(Poppy groans)

01:01:03.668 --> 01:01:08.266
- [Poppy] Just 'scuse me just a moment.

01:01:08.266 --> 01:01:10.433
(retches)

01:01:13.124 --> 01:01:15.207
(coughs)

01:01:17.705 --> 01:01:18.655
Is there any water?

01:01:31.217 --> 01:01:32.130
Give us a kiss.

01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:35.513
Oh.

01:01:36.706 --> 01:01:37.539
(gags) Hang on.

01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:40.480
Oh God, I'm not,

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:43.670
I'm not done. (gags and coughs)

01:01:47.113 --> 01:01:50.354
(harmonic folk music)

01:01:50.354 --> 01:01:51.804
(metal banging)
Jesus, fuck!

01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:56.370
- [Elaine] Time to get up,
we've got some hiking to do.

01:01:56.370 --> 01:01:59.326
- [Poppy] (groans) Five more minutes?

01:01:59.326 --> 01:02:03.570
- Poppy, I have a lot
planned this holiday,

01:02:03.570 --> 01:02:05.470
and I do not wanna miss a thing.

01:02:07.776 --> 01:02:09.440
- (laughs) Okay!

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:10.680
Okay! (groans)

01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:11.513
I'm up.

01:02:12.670 --> 01:02:14.500
(inhales through teeth) I'm up.

01:02:15.436 --> 01:02:19.603
(harmonic, expressive folk music)

01:02:29.335 --> 01:02:31.750
(Poppy panting)

01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:33.322
- [Elaine] Come on.

01:02:33.322 --> 01:02:34.905
It's not that hard.

01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:38.770
- We just passed two dead hobbits.

01:02:55.960 --> 01:03:00.095
We are in a place where the
feet of the tramping millions

01:03:00.095 --> 01:03:02.620
have not trodden its grass to dust,

01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:04.110
nor the din of the myriad cities

01:03:04.110 --> 01:03:05.940
chased the silence forever away.

01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:11.080
So, we walk hand-in-hand with
nature under the great sky,

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:15.500
living in sun-kissed tents
amid the lowing herds.

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:19.830
The great earth rolls around in stillness,

01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:22.400
unladen with trouble and wrong.

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:26.670
And we are free,

01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:29.733
for a time.

01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:53.730
We're lost as fuck, aren't we?

01:03:54.864 --> 01:03:58.697
(Elaine laughs sarcastically)

01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:02.490
(Poppy sighs)

01:04:03.366 --> 01:04:07.199
(gentle, feel-good pop music)

01:04:40.716 --> 01:04:41.549
I need a shower.

01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:49.160
I somehow seem to have an
irresistible allure over mud.

01:04:50.170 --> 01:04:51.570
I swear, sometimes my friends invite me

01:04:51.570 --> 01:04:54.370
to outdoor activities, just
so that they can stay clean.

01:04:55.512 --> 01:05:00.169
(gentle, feel-good pop music)

01:05:00.169 --> 01:05:02.919
(women laughing)

01:05:04.451 --> 01:05:05.284
- Hi.

01:05:05.284 --> 01:05:06.630
- Hey.

01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:07.590
- I thought...

01:05:11.170 --> 01:05:12.770
I thought I'd grab a shower too.

01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:18.390
- You don't have to be jealous.

01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:21.070
Look, all I was doing was
putting in a good word for Phil.

01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:23.253
- Right.

01:05:27.270 --> 01:05:29.853
(Poppy scoffs)

01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:37.240
- [Hugo] Poppy, feet off the couch.

01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:39.680
- It's not working.

01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:40.810
- [Hugo] What's not working?

01:05:40.810 --> 01:05:42.590
- My fake relationship!

01:05:42.590 --> 01:05:45.080
- [Hugo] What exactly
are you doing, Poppy?

01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:47.780
- Listen, Hugo, I ask the
questions around here, okay?

01:05:48.830 --> 01:05:50.080
How do I patch things up?

01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:54.020
- Have you considered letting them know

01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:57.570
who you really are?

01:05:57.570 --> 01:05:59.860
- Okay, if you're not gonna
say antyhing constructive,

01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:02.200
then why am I even here?

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:04.840
- Have you considered
telling them about your past?

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:08.390
About your family, about
your struggles, your secrets,

01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:09.826
have you...

01:06:09.826 --> 01:06:12.580
(sighs) How do you like to handle money?

01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:14.310
- Temporarily, usually.

01:06:14.310 --> 01:06:15.370
- Ha ha.

01:06:15.370 --> 01:06:16.850
What about your expectation?

01:06:16.850 --> 01:06:19.070
- I don't have any expectations.

01:06:19.070 --> 01:06:21.950
- What about the possibility
of having children?

01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:22.783
- Wha?

01:06:22.783 --> 01:06:24.270
Are you out of your damn mind?

01:06:25.410 --> 01:06:26.460
Honestly, I'm starting to wonder

01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:28.430
what the hell I'm even doing here.

01:06:29.867 --> 01:06:32.367
(Hugo groans)

01:06:34.576 --> 01:06:35.885
(Hugo sighs)
(window thuds softly)

01:06:35.885 --> 01:06:38.468
(Hugo grunts)

01:06:46.066 --> 01:06:50.399
(person knock aggressively on door)

01:06:51.992 --> 01:06:54.480
- I want to know why you
were flirting with that girl.

01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:57.130
- What girl?

01:06:57.130 --> 01:06:59.040
- The girl from the
showers at the campsite;

01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:01.490
why do I even have to say this?

01:07:01.490 --> 01:07:04.162
Are there a bunch more
that I don't know about?

01:07:04.162 --> 01:07:04.995
- No.

01:07:04.995 --> 01:07:07.830
- Okay, and why don't you
want us to move in together?

01:07:07.830 --> 01:07:09.290
- Are we really gonna do this right now?

01:07:09.290 --> 01:07:10.123
- Yes.

01:07:10.123 --> 01:07:12.990
We are going to do this
right here, right now.

01:07:12.990 --> 01:07:14.130
- It's gonna throw off our whole schedule,

01:07:14.130 --> 01:07:15.350
I'm gonna have to redo the whole thing.

01:07:15.350 --> 01:07:16.560
- Poppy, I really don't care

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:18.600
about your stupid writing schedule.

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:21.880
- Right, this'll probably
mess with that too.

01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:23.153
Great.

01:07:23.153 --> 01:07:24.200
- Poppy, will you just listen to me?

01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:26.110
- No, yeah, I'm listening.

01:07:26.110 --> 01:07:26.943
I'm listening.

01:07:28.290 --> 01:07:30.070
- I just want to know what's going on.

01:07:32.646 --> 01:07:35.512
- Come with me.

01:07:35.512 --> 01:07:37.845
I'll tell you about my past,

01:07:40.449 --> 01:07:43.425
maybe even some of my secrets.

01:07:43.425 --> 01:07:46.258
(Elaine chuckles)

01:07:48.006 --> 01:07:52.256
(light, catchy instrumental music)

01:08:28.209 --> 01:08:31.376
(Poppy clears throat)

01:08:50.912 --> 01:08:51.830
- Hi, Pops.

01:08:52.831 --> 01:08:53.663
- Hi.

01:08:53.663 --> 01:08:55.109
- You're early, why are you early?

01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:58.050
- You said you wanted to see me?

01:08:58.050 --> 01:08:59.368
- Yes, honey.

01:08:59.368 --> 01:09:04.368
Come on in.

01:09:07.569 --> 01:09:09.460
- Absolutely impressed.

01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:10.810
- You are?
- Yes, I am.

01:09:11.825 --> 01:09:14.149
- Hon, you did great work over the summer.

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:17.050
A little bit savage,
but (sighs) delicious.

01:09:17.050 --> 01:09:18.319
- I'm glad you like it.

01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:20.020
- Russell's very happy too.

01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:21.270
- Cool.

01:09:21.270 --> 01:09:23.020
- You'd be amazed at what sells.

01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:25.660
- I also have a couple
of top-line magazines

01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:26.910
looking for contributors.

01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:28.712
- So,

01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:30.840
it needs an ending, huh?

01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:33.090
- [Angela] Yes it does.

01:09:34.569 --> 01:09:36.214
- Well,

01:09:36.214 --> 01:09:38.580
I guess I'm gonna have to figure out

01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:39.930
what that's gonna be, then.

01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:50.420
- You know, I still don't get it.

01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:51.760
- [Angela] Get what?

01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:53.350
- The concept.

01:09:53.350 --> 01:09:54.940
I mean, if you're
maintaining your relationship

01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:56.150
with someone, what's the difference

01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:57.500
between that and faking it?

01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:00.290
- [Angela] I don't know.

01:10:00.290 --> 01:10:02.330
(cellphone buzzes)

01:10:02.330 --> 01:10:03.163
Hello?

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:09.860
- So, how did your day go?

01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:12.310
- It was good.

01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:13.143
Good.

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:15.433
- Productive?

01:10:17.050 --> 01:10:17.883
- Yes.

01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:22.190
Actually, I think the deal's set.

01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:25.780
- That's great!

01:10:27.564 --> 01:10:28.814
God, you're so wonderful.

01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:30.493
- Mm.

01:10:31.570 --> 01:10:32.403
Wow.

01:10:34.810 --> 01:10:35.650
Thank you.

01:10:41.468 --> 01:10:43.650
(chuckles)

01:10:43.650 --> 01:10:45.900
Obviously, I should get
published more often.

01:10:52.016 --> 01:10:55.599
(longing orchestral music)

01:11:02.781 --> 01:11:05.781
(attendees chatter)

01:11:30.970 --> 01:11:32.230
- This reception is delightful, Elaine.

01:11:32.230 --> 01:11:33.780
- Thank you so much.

01:11:35.122 --> 01:11:37.060
I think everyone's enjoying themselves.

01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:38.610
- Think the mayor certainly is.

01:11:41.842 --> 01:11:44.730
(both chuckle)

01:11:44.730 --> 01:11:46.330
- [Ramon] Please, enter.

01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:49.160
It's time for Delusion.

01:11:57.938 --> 01:11:59.021
- [Poppy] So,

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.230
now we find out what
it's all about, do we?

01:12:06.490 --> 01:12:07.330
- Anytime now.

01:12:10.728 --> 01:12:12.131
(someone farts)

01:12:12.131 --> 01:12:13.730
- Really, people?

01:12:13.730 --> 01:12:15.030
Is that how it's gonna be?

01:12:19.410 --> 01:12:20.510
- Nothing's happening.

01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:22.670
- Yeah.

01:12:22.670 --> 01:12:23.730
I know.

01:12:23.730 --> 01:12:25.339
Couldn't help but notice

01:12:25.339 --> 01:12:27.760
that a big old bag of
nothing is happening.

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.200
- Shut up and follow me.

01:12:38.550 --> 01:12:39.660
- What's that?

01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:41.130
- Night vision.

01:12:41.130 --> 01:12:44.110
It's the faces of the people
as they come to a realization.

01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:49.180
- [Elaine] Where's the show, Ramon?

01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:50.540
- That's the realization.

01:12:51.670 --> 01:12:53.390
There is no show!

01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:56.160
That's why it's called Delusion.

01:12:57.930 --> 01:12:58.763
- What?

01:13:00.305 --> 01:13:02.045
(Elaine yells)

01:13:02.045 --> 01:13:03.401
(Ramon groaning)

01:13:03.401 --> 01:13:05.890
I invited everyone I know!

01:13:05.890 --> 01:13:08.782
You son of a bitch!
(Ramon screams)

01:13:08.782 --> 01:13:10.496
(Elaine yells)

01:13:10.496 --> 01:13:12.041
- [Ramon] Don't you see
how brilliant it is?

01:13:12.041 --> 01:13:15.241
(Elaine yelling)
(Ramon groans)

01:13:15.241 --> 01:13:16.483
- [Ramon] Ow!

01:13:16.483 --> 01:13:17.316
She's not nice!

01:13:17.316 --> 01:13:18.803
She's not nice, guys!

01:13:18.803 --> 01:13:20.410
- Should we do something?

01:13:21.820 --> 01:13:22.970
- No.

01:13:22.970 --> 01:13:25.170
No no no, it's better to
just let her work it all

01:13:25.170 --> 01:13:26.370
out of her system first!

01:13:27.411 --> 01:13:29.470
(Ramon screams)

01:13:29.470 --> 01:13:32.220
(Elaine yelling)

01:13:33.993 --> 01:13:36.848
- Stay down!
(Ramon cries)

01:13:36.848 --> 01:13:38.765
Stay down, you bastard!

01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:44.030
- [Ramon] I can't feel my spleen.

01:13:44.030 --> 01:13:44.863
- Good!

01:14:00.361 --> 01:14:03.194
(Elaine sniffles)

01:14:05.923 --> 01:14:07.820
I just can't believe
he would do this to me.

01:14:09.610 --> 01:14:11.810
- I can't believe what you did to him.

01:14:11.810 --> 01:14:13.560
Especially with that wine bottle.

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:14.720
- (scoffs) Please be serious.

01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:16.380
- I am.

01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:19.240
It is gonna take a whole lot of time,

01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:21.860
and a whole lot of patience,

01:14:21.860 --> 01:14:23.860
and a whole lot of lube,
to get it back out.

01:14:28.822 --> 01:14:30.730
(Elaine groans)

01:14:30.730 --> 01:14:32.980
You're a very special person, Elaine.

01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:34.993
You are

01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:40.130
kind, and you're passionate,

01:14:40.130 --> 01:14:41.900
and you're intelligent,

01:14:41.900 --> 01:14:46.375
and you have exquisite
taste in food and wine.

01:14:46.375 --> 01:14:49.997
(Elaine chuckles)

01:14:49.997 --> 01:14:51.030
- You think so?

01:14:51.030 --> 01:14:51.960
- Yes, I do.

01:14:55.158 --> 01:14:55.991
And

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:00.000
you mean a great deal to me.

01:15:05.993 --> 01:15:07.443
- I mean a great deal to you.

01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:10.353
Hm.

01:15:12.610 --> 01:15:14.390
Well, thanks, I guess.

01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:17.353
- Yup.

01:15:18.430 --> 01:15:19.263
No problem.

01:15:26.149 --> 01:15:28.732
(Angela sighs)

01:15:29.850 --> 01:15:31.550
- You know what, this is good, but

01:15:33.490 --> 01:15:35.583
come on, aren't you almost done?

01:15:35.583 --> 01:15:38.340
I mean, this sounds
like a bit of a tangent.

01:15:38.340 --> 01:15:40.560
- I'm not sure if I'm done yet.

01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:44.420
- But Poppy, this is no time
to get the jitters, okay?

01:15:44.420 --> 01:15:47.370
Let's just slam this home and
let's really start selling.

01:15:49.850 --> 01:15:50.683
- Sure.

01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:54.060
- Poppy, I'm gonna make you famous.

01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:56.150
You are gonna be on every TV, radio show,

01:15:56.150 --> 01:15:57.980
every website you can think of;

01:15:57.980 --> 01:15:59.190
everyone is gonna know your name,

01:15:59.190 --> 01:16:00.640
you're gonna go crazy!

01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:02.140
Everyone's gonna hang on your every word,

01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:04.860
and it's gonna be everywhrere!

01:16:06.380 --> 01:16:07.213
- Oh, good.

01:16:08.728 --> 01:16:12.895
(apprehensive instrumental music)

01:16:18.901 --> 01:16:20.770
I can enjoy feeling melancholy.

01:16:20.770 --> 01:16:22.060
There's a good deal of satisfaction

01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:24.190
in being thoroughly miserable,

01:16:24.190 --> 01:16:25.890
but nobody likes feeling wound up.

01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:29.020
You're just as likely to feel it

01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:30.720
on the day after you've come into money

01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:33.610
as you are on the day after
you've just left your new phone

01:16:33.610 --> 01:16:34.443
on the bus.

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:42.120
You become stupid, restless, irritable,

01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:48.590
rude to strangers, dangerous
toward your friends,

01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:51.490
clumsy, and quarrelsome.

01:16:54.570 --> 01:16:57.180
Nuisance to yourself
and everybody about you.

01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:01.550
(sighs) Which can be satisfying
in itself, sometimes.

01:17:05.180 --> 01:17:08.750
Besides, who would care two hoots,

01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:11.750
whatever precise amount of
care a hoot may represent,

01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:16.750
whether you are blown up, hung
up, or drowned, or married?

01:17:18.210 --> 01:17:20.950
You have never been
thoroughly appreciated,

01:17:20.950 --> 01:17:22.820
you have never been met
with your just rewards

01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:24.270
in any one part of your life.

01:17:26.502 --> 01:17:28.420
And this works you up into
a state of savage fury

01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:31.600
against everyone and
everything, especially yourself,

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:34.450
whom anatomical reasons alone
prevent you from kicking.

01:17:41.804 --> 01:17:43.623
(sighs)

01:17:43.623 --> 01:17:46.160
At least you can bully your
partner: grumble at the dinner,

01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:48.400
insist on watching
something they don't like,

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:50.250
and after you've creatd a
good deal of disturbance

01:17:50.250 --> 01:17:52.390
around the house, at least
you can enjoy the feeling

01:17:52.390 --> 01:17:55.590
of having created some
trouble for somebody else.

01:18:18.953 --> 01:18:20.720
But to the victims of this, I would say

01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:23.720
it is worth it to know that
just because someone pushes you,

01:18:24.969 --> 01:18:25.802
it doesn't mean they don't enjoy

01:18:25.802 --> 01:18:29.650
having something to push against.

01:18:49.134 --> 01:18:49.984
- What is it now?

01:18:54.837 --> 01:18:57.560
- I just want you to know that I...

01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:04.810
That I--
- Just let me sleep.

01:19:15.811 --> 01:19:16.644
- Okay.

01:19:34.229 --> 01:19:38.312
(intimate acoustic-guitar music)

01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:42.473
Look at her.

01:19:43.533 --> 01:19:44.950
An example of smug satisfaction

01:19:44.950 --> 01:19:47.300
I've never seen outside
of a religious meeting.

01:19:49.693 --> 01:19:50.526
Vanity.

01:19:52.860 --> 01:19:53.840
Everybody's vain.

01:19:57.560 --> 01:20:00.760
Goodness in a pet's eyes is stroking them

01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:02.110
and feeding them with food.

01:20:04.129 --> 01:20:04.962
(Elaine chuckles)

01:20:04.962 --> 01:20:06.660
I fear this narrow-minded view of virtue

01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:11.491
is not confined to pets.

01:20:11.491 --> 01:20:16.170
A good man is a man who is good to us.

01:20:16.170 --> 01:20:18.700
A bad man is, well, a man who doesn't do

01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:19.850
what we want him to do.

01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:24.010
See, the truth is that
we have, each of us,

01:20:24.010 --> 01:20:27.130
this inborn conviction
that the whole world,

01:20:27.130 --> 01:20:29.715
with everybody and everything in it,

01:20:29.715 --> 01:20:34.500
was created as some sort
of appendage to ourselves,

01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:38.020
and you and I, we're both
the center of the universe,

01:20:39.053 --> 01:20:44.053
in our respective opinions.

01:20:46.611 --> 01:20:50.861
(light, catchy instrumental music)

01:20:52.570 --> 01:20:56.360
Of course, it is in our follies
that we are truly united.

01:20:57.390 --> 01:21:00.940
Some of us are pious,
some of us are generous.

01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:04.710
Some few of us are honest,
comparaatively speaking,

01:21:04.710 --> 01:21:09.710
and some, even fewer still,
may possibly be truthful.

01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:30.340
- Do you have the ribbons?

01:21:30.340 --> 01:21:31.173
- Ribbons?

01:21:31.173 --> 01:21:32.720
- Yeah, the ribbons to decorate the table.

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:33.780
Are they in your box?

01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:35.740
- Oh, no, sorry, they're not.

01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:39.340
- Okay, I'll just quickly go get it.

01:21:39.340 --> 01:21:40.460
- Yeah, okay.

01:21:40.460 --> 01:21:42.710
Yeah, you do that, I'm just gonna say hi

01:21:42.710 --> 01:21:44.850
to the neighbors and stuff.

01:21:54.669 --> 01:21:58.836
(murky, suspicious ambient music)

01:22:07.185 --> 01:22:10.018
(telephone rings)

01:22:15.364 --> 01:22:16.580
- Hi, who is this?

01:22:16.580 --> 01:22:17.870
- It's me, Patsy.

01:22:17.870 --> 01:22:19.960
- Oh, hey Patsy, do you need Poppy?

01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:21.870
- Yeah, there are some
errors in her last submission

01:22:21.870 --> 01:22:23.650
that need to be sorted out.

01:22:23.650 --> 01:22:25.540
- Oh, did you email her?

01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:27.460
- Well, I can, but we need
these for Monday morning,

01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:29.160
and she's not really the
easiest to reach out,

01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:30.220
if you know what I mean.

01:22:30.220 --> 01:22:31.460
Can you get her for me?

01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:34.020
- Actually, she's not near
the phone at the moment.

01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:37.810
Why don't you just send it to me?

01:22:39.090 --> 01:22:41.730
- You have seen all this stuff, right?

01:22:41.730 --> 01:22:42.563
- Of course.

01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:44.633
- Okay.

01:22:44.633 --> 01:22:45.466
I'll send it over to you.

01:22:45.466 --> 01:22:46.360
What's your email?

01:22:56.750 --> 01:22:58.332
- Oh my God!

01:22:58.332 --> 01:22:59.890
(exciting rock music)

01:22:59.890 --> 01:23:00.723
Oh shit!

01:23:04.429 --> 01:23:07.346
(people screaming)

01:23:12.227 --> 01:23:15.060
(insects buzzing)

01:23:25.330 --> 01:23:26.680
- Do we have any bug spray?

01:23:28.190 --> 01:23:29.023
- We?

01:23:29.900 --> 01:23:30.920
Who's we?

01:23:32.010 --> 01:23:32.843
- What?

01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:36.553
What is that?

01:23:37.485 --> 01:23:38.318
(Elaine whimpers)

01:23:38.318 --> 01:23:40.280
- Patsy just sent me your latest work.

01:23:41.910 --> 01:23:43.290
- Why would she do that?

01:23:44.350 --> 01:23:47.450
- Because you never answer
your fucking emails!

01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:49.350
- This is fantasy.

01:23:49.350 --> 01:23:51.670
Okay, look, it's just made up!

01:23:51.670 --> 01:23:52.580
- Made up?

01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:53.460
Made up?

01:23:53.460 --> 01:23:55.560
It's me, every little bit of it is me!

01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:56.410
- Please, I'm sorry!

01:23:56.410 --> 01:23:57.802
I'm sorry!

01:23:57.802 --> 01:23:58.635
- How dare you?

01:23:58.635 --> 01:24:00.530
How dare you degrade me like that?

01:24:00.530 --> 01:24:02.370
How dare you waste my life?

01:24:02.370 --> 01:24:03.840
- No, we're not fake!

01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:05.470
This is not fake!

01:24:08.330 --> 01:24:09.940
We're not fake.

01:24:09.940 --> 01:24:10.773
- Not fake?

01:24:14.420 --> 01:24:15.253
Fuck you!

01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:19.510
Well at least now I know that
you acted like the disloyal,

01:24:19.510 --> 01:24:23.310
scheming, cliche-ridden,
side-sliming, talentless,

01:24:23.310 --> 01:24:26.670
worthless, thoughtless, tasteless,

01:24:26.670 --> 01:24:29.580
flat-chested, cross-eyed, split-ended,

01:24:29.580 --> 01:24:33.270
saggy-assed bucket of slug
nuggets that you truly are!

01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:39.990
- What are slut nuggets?

01:24:41.610 --> 01:24:42.750
- You acted.

01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:45.330
You acted like a man.

01:24:49.387 --> 01:24:51.804
(door beeps)

01:24:56.605 --> 01:24:59.105
(Poppy sighs)

01:25:05.964 --> 01:25:07.010
- But I love you.

01:25:09.841 --> 01:25:14.258
(pained, regretful orchestral music)

01:25:35.045 --> 01:25:37.712
(Poppy shrieks)

01:25:38.710 --> 01:25:40.240
- Yeah.

01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:42.220
Mike is gonna take me to the hospital.

01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:44.030
Would you please take Toby?

01:25:44.030 --> 01:25:45.430
- [Poppy] Um, no, I just--

01:25:45.430 --> 01:25:48.405
- Poppy, please!

01:25:48.405 --> 01:25:49.925
- [Poppy] Uh, yes.

01:25:49.925 --> 01:25:51.307
Yes, yeah, yeah.
- Thank you.

01:25:51.307 --> 01:25:52.651
- [Poppy] Come here.

01:25:52.651 --> 01:25:53.969
Come here.

01:25:53.969 --> 01:25:54.802
It's okay.

01:26:06.609 --> 01:26:11.192
(wretched, despairing classical music)

01:27:18.091 --> 01:27:21.200
(telephone rings)

01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:22.160
- [Angela] Hi, Pops.

01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:22.993
It's Angela.

01:27:25.270 --> 01:27:26.103
- Oh, hi.

01:27:26.103 --> 01:27:28.940
- [Angela] So, Elaine
is threatening to sue us

01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:30.730
if we publish anything.

01:27:30.730 --> 01:27:32.640
Have you spoken to her about this?

01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:34.220
- No, no.

01:27:34.220 --> 01:27:37.420
I've called and I've called,
she won't talk to me.

01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:38.410
- [Angela] Okay.

01:27:38.410 --> 01:27:40.740
That basically means I can't sell this,

01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:42.190
and we don't have any time or money

01:27:42.190 --> 01:27:43.840
to have a lawyer go through it.

01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:46.030
It'll be too expensive, Pops.

01:27:46.030 --> 01:27:48.360
So this call is basically to say goodbye.

01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:52.440
Sorry kid, but a lot of time
has been wasted on this.

01:27:56.100 --> 01:27:56.933
- Bye, Angela.

01:28:03.071 --> 01:28:07.488
(pained, regretful orchestral music)

01:28:16.346 --> 01:28:19.013
(Poppy sobbing)

01:28:27.053 --> 01:28:27.886
Oh, buddy.

01:28:30.655 --> 01:28:31.488
It's okay.

01:28:41.123 --> 01:28:42.730
- [Landlord] So, you've
got a little window here.

01:28:50.796 --> 01:28:54.300
It's small, but it's not all that shitty.

01:28:55.780 --> 01:28:57.150
- It's cheap.

01:28:57.150 --> 01:28:58.790
And you take pets, right?

01:28:58.790 --> 01:28:59.623
- Yep.

01:28:59.623 --> 01:29:01.320
And I need first and last,

01:29:02.380 --> 01:29:03.490
and sign here.

01:29:05.070 --> 01:29:06.060
- Frank Biggs.

01:29:08.249 --> 01:29:10.480
Oh, I know a Loretta Biggs.

01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:11.330
From Haro Street.

01:29:13.180 --> 01:29:14.013
- Oh yeah.

01:29:17.401 --> 01:29:18.234
We were married.

01:29:19.540 --> 01:29:20.373
- Oh.

01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:22.790
- [Frank] Long story, long ago.

01:29:27.565 --> 01:29:28.950
- Tell me.

01:29:28.950 --> 01:29:30.200
- We had a son,

01:29:34.589 --> 01:29:35.589
and he died.

01:29:39.949 --> 01:29:41.199
- I'm so sorry.

01:29:43.387 --> 01:29:45.230
- We didn't make it through it.

01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:49.590
Couldn't even look at each other.

01:29:56.560 --> 01:29:58.760
- Yeah, I just broke
up with my girlfriend.

01:30:00.820 --> 01:30:01.735
- Really?

01:30:01.735 --> 01:30:05.270
Why's that?

01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:06.103
- I lied.

01:30:08.370 --> 01:30:09.203
A lot.

01:30:12.523 --> 01:30:14.060
- Well you know,

01:30:14.060 --> 01:30:15.780
it really isn't the lies.

01:30:17.070 --> 01:30:19.880
It's the being shut out that matters.

01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:20.880
People hate that.

01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:25.980
Loretta, she shut me out,

01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:29.640
and wouldn't speak to me about it.

01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:32.620
Tried to fill her life
full of community events

01:30:33.771 --> 01:30:36.540
and some other bullshit.

01:30:39.094 --> 01:30:39.927
- Right.

01:30:45.666 --> 01:30:49.810
- But, you know,

01:30:49.810 --> 01:30:53.133
we live, we learn.

01:30:53.133 --> 01:30:53.966
Huh?

01:31:10.509 --> 01:31:11.342
(Ramon gasps)
- Hi, Poppy.

01:31:11.342 --> 01:31:12.320
- [Poppy] Hey.

01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:13.940
- Is Elaine here?

01:31:13.940 --> 01:31:15.360
- No.

01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:18.090
No, you're quite safe.

01:31:18.090 --> 01:31:19.140
- What are you up to.

01:31:21.430 --> 01:31:23.360
- I'm looking for inspiration.

01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:25.320
- You're not going to find it here.

01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:26.153
- He's right.

01:31:26.153 --> 01:31:27.950
Maybe you should try Toronto.

01:31:27.950 --> 01:31:30.620
- Shut up Clive, that's
not what I mean at all.

01:31:30.620 --> 01:31:33.620
What I mean, for an artist to create,

01:31:33.620 --> 01:31:35.160
they must look within themselves

01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:37.180
rather than at everyone else.

01:31:37.180 --> 01:31:41.315
A true artist looks so
closely at themselves

01:31:41.315 --> 01:31:43.815
that they learn something
new about everyone else.

01:31:49.260 --> 01:31:50.093
- Bye, guys.

01:31:51.030 --> 01:31:52.480
Hope the bruises have healed.

01:31:55.157 --> 01:31:58.824
(simple acoustic pop music)

01:32:15.838 --> 01:32:17.838
(sighs)

01:32:25.314 --> 01:32:26.440
What's the point of being an idle person

01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:28.440
if you just don't wanna be idle anymore?

01:32:30.195 --> 01:32:34.278
(intimate acoustic-guitar music)

01:32:36.893 --> 01:32:37.726
And then I leave, and
then all of a sudden,

01:32:38.607 --> 01:32:40.290
me and Elaine are getting
into this giant fight,

01:32:40.290 --> 01:32:42.790
she's gone, she does want to
have anything to do with me,

01:32:42.790 --> 01:32:44.550
she won't even speak to me.

01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:46.680
I know you're mad at me,
you're probably mad at me;

01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:48.900
I'm so sorry, you guys.

01:32:48.900 --> 01:32:51.540
I know that it seemed that it
completely happened on purpose

01:32:51.540 --> 01:32:53.420
but it really did not, I had no idea.

01:32:53.420 --> 01:32:55.830
There was no explaining it.

01:32:55.830 --> 01:32:57.870
I'm so sorry.

01:32:57.870 --> 01:32:58.703
Loretta, I am

01:33:03.530 --> 01:33:06.660
so sorry that I ruined your event.

01:33:08.115 --> 01:33:08.948
I...

01:33:14.995 --> 01:33:17.745
(Poppy sniffles)

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:20.833
- [Loretta] Did you love her?

01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:26.153
- Yeah.

01:33:29.070 --> 01:33:29.903
Yeah I did.

01:33:35.210 --> 01:33:36.043
But she's gone.

01:33:39.290 --> 01:33:40.123
Forever.

01:33:51.629 --> 01:33:54.296
(Loretta sighs)

01:33:55.892 --> 01:33:58.692
(Loretta sniffles)

01:33:58.692 --> 01:33:59.525
- Oh, Poppy.

01:34:01.140 --> 01:34:01.973
Life is hard.

01:34:04.030 --> 01:34:05.290
There are some problems in life

01:34:05.290 --> 01:34:06.790
that are truly insurmountable,

01:34:09.164 --> 01:34:11.220
but this is not one of them.

01:34:11.220 --> 01:34:12.053
Okay?

01:34:14.910 --> 01:34:18.400
Now, listen very carefully.

01:34:21.162 --> 01:34:25.745
(wretched, despairing classical music)

01:34:33.510 --> 01:34:34.850
- Hi, Patsy.

01:34:34.850 --> 01:34:35.683
- Hi, Elaine.

01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:37.910
- Day off?

01:34:37.910 --> 01:34:39.550
- Half-day, actually.

01:34:39.550 --> 01:34:41.360
I have some papers due in the evening.

01:34:42.730 --> 01:34:44.080
- Well, at least something.

01:34:46.190 --> 01:34:47.023
- Elaine.

01:34:48.370 --> 01:34:49.470
I wanted to say sorry.

01:34:51.700 --> 01:34:52.533
- For what?

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:55.090
It's not your fault.

01:34:56.640 --> 01:35:01.320
It's not your fault I fell in
love with the wrong person.

01:35:02.790 --> 01:35:05.080
- Maybe you didn't fall in
love with the wrong person.

01:35:06.630 --> 01:35:08.050
Maybe you fell in love
with the right person

01:35:08.050 --> 01:35:10.460
but that person's just a
little bit wrong for you.

01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:15.460
- You're 12, right?

01:35:15.460 --> 01:35:16.293
- 13.

01:35:18.279 --> 01:35:22.029
(emotional orchestral music)

01:38:02.511 --> 01:38:05.430
- What would you say if I told you

01:38:05.430 --> 01:38:07.480
I was gonna work much harder from now on?

01:38:14.650 --> 01:38:18.890
Super heroes, space battles,
and high production values,

01:38:18.890 --> 01:38:20.090
you might give us a try.

01:38:21.020 --> 01:38:21.870
Be a nice change.

01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:24.393
But,

01:38:26.190 --> 01:38:29.300
I am in danger of skipping ahead.

01:38:29.300 --> 01:38:30.650
You want to know about her.

01:38:32.150 --> 01:38:34.300
You want to know how
it got so complicated.

01:38:36.140 --> 01:38:38.807
(metal rattles)

01:38:51.180 --> 01:38:53.712
- Well, what would you have said?

01:38:53.712 --> 01:38:55.787
(chuckles)

01:38:55.787 --> 01:38:59.537
(optimistic indie pop music)
