WEBVTT

00:03.503 --> 00:05.571
Alan!

00:05.573 --> 00:07.006
I have to meet larry for dinner.

00:07.008 --> 00:08.040
Are you ready yet?

00:08.042 --> 00:11.443
Alan:
The question is: Are you?

00:17.617 --> 00:20.686
(muffled):
Happy anniversary, baby.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.321
What?

00:28.661 --> 00:30.496
Six months ago today,

00:30.498 --> 00:32.898
We cheated on larry
for the first time.

00:32.900 --> 00:35.234
So, to commemorate the occasion,

00:35.236 --> 00:38.003
You donned the traditional
balloon underpants?

00:38.005 --> 00:39.338
Exactly.

00:39.340 --> 00:42.708
I have a "heart-on"
for you.

00:43.676 --> 00:45.411
Charming.

00:45.413 --> 00:47.246
Yeah, I was gonna get you
a dozen roses,

00:47.248 --> 00:48.981
But I-I thought
the balloons were cuter.

00:48.983 --> 00:50.082
Cheaper.

00:50.084 --> 00:52.584
Six of one, half off the other.

00:52.586 --> 00:55.154
I'm not sure this is something
we should be celebrating.

00:55.156 --> 00:57.723
Come on, you have loved
every chapter

00:57.725 --> 00:59.758
In our book of forbidden trysts.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.895
That magical night in the
handicapped stall at chili's.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.999
The time we put a scare into
that field trip of sixth graders

01:07.001 --> 01:08.967
At the planetarium
when they saw uranus.

01:13.873 --> 01:17.376
That weekend that
larry went back east

01:17.378 --> 01:19.278
And we went "down south."

01:19.280 --> 01:22.214
Alan... I don't have
time for this.

01:22.216 --> 01:24.383
Well, then open your present.

01:24.385 --> 01:26.752
Spoiler alert: It's my penis
and two of his friends.

01:28.021 --> 01:30.589
And you can't return it
if it's the wrong size.

01:30.591 --> 01:33.325
As fun as all this is,
I only have about ten minutes

01:33.327 --> 01:36.095
Before I have to go meet larry,
so we got to make this quick.

01:36.097 --> 01:37.963
Ooh, my specialty.

01:37.965 --> 01:40.933
First, I'm getting
rid of these balloons.

01:42.802 --> 01:44.770
Oh. Oh.

01:44.772 --> 01:47.473
I-I should've had <i>you</i>
<i>blow them up.</i>

01:47.475 --> 01:50.075
(high-pitched):
I know what you like, baby.

01:50.077 --> 01:52.744
♪ men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men ♪

01:52.746 --> 01:55.581
♪ ah.
♪ men.

02:01.688 --> 02:02.955
Hey, bitches.

02:02.957 --> 02:05.390
Hey.
Hey.

02:05.392 --> 02:06.792
What are you guys up to tonight?

02:06.794 --> 02:08.293
Oh, dinner and game night.

02:08.295 --> 02:10.195
My ex-wife and I
used to do that.

02:10.197 --> 02:13.298
Our favorite game was life,
until she ruined mine.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.667
Yeah, we're more fans of
monopoly, backgammon...

02:15.669 --> 02:17.870
Hungry hungry lesbos.

02:17.872 --> 02:21.106
It's like hungry hungry hippos,
but we don't eat balls.

02:23.076 --> 02:25.377
How do you know
when you've won that game?

02:25.379 --> 02:27.246
Trust me, you know.

02:27.248 --> 02:29.014
Hey, something smells good.

02:29.016 --> 02:30.682
Yeah, we play that, too.

02:32.485 --> 02:34.086
Hey, you guys want to
join us for dinner?

02:34.088 --> 02:35.888
Oh, no, I can't.
I'm going to the movies.

02:35.890 --> 02:37.523
Oh, alan, you
want to join?

02:37.525 --> 02:39.525
Is it a porn movie?

02:41.060 --> 02:45.497
Why would I invite a guy
to watch a porn in a theater?

02:45.499 --> 02:47.933
So nobody weird
sits next to you.

02:47.935 --> 02:51.570
Well, going with you
wouldn't solve that problem.

02:52.539 --> 02:54.573
Fine. Go watch
your porn by yourself.

02:54.575 --> 02:56.575
I'm not watching a porn!

02:56.577 --> 02:59.044
Uh-huh. And I don't
use your bathroom to poop.

03:00.346 --> 03:01.880
Look, I can't go anyway,
'cause I'm having a drink

03:01.882 --> 03:02.948
With my girlfriend's boyfriend.

03:02.950 --> 03:05.584
Why don't you poop
in his toilet?

03:05.586 --> 03:08.020
You're already
banging his girlfriend.

03:09.556 --> 03:12.024
You got a flat tire.
I got a what?

03:12.026 --> 03:14.459
I noticed it when I was
getting out of your car.

03:14.461 --> 03:16.695
Why were you in my car?

03:16.697 --> 03:18.030
Taking a nap.

03:18.032 --> 03:20.766
Why were you
taking a nap in my car?

03:20.768 --> 03:24.002
I was getting high,
and I just went to sleep.

03:24.004 --> 03:27.005
Why were you
getting high in my car?!

03:27.007 --> 03:29.541
Because you hide
your pot in the car!

03:30.610 --> 03:33.812
Geez! Which one of us
is high, you or me?

03:38.785 --> 03:40.786
(groans)
great.

03:40.788 --> 03:42.521
Either of you guys
got triple-a?

03:42.523 --> 03:46.325
You don't need triple-a
when you got double d's.

03:46.327 --> 03:48.327
Why don't you just
change it yourself?

03:48.329 --> 03:51.063
Eh, sounds like
a lot of work.

03:51.065 --> 03:52.864
I'll just buy a new car.

03:52.866 --> 03:55.667
Or you could use
the spare tire and jack.

03:55.669 --> 03:57.035
Oh, there's nothing in there.

03:58.972 --> 04:02.207
Whoa... There's a trunk
under the trunk!

04:02.209 --> 04:04.876
Somebody's never smuggled
anything out of mexico.

04:04.878 --> 04:07.613
Here, uh, you grab the spare,
I'll loosen the lug nuts.

04:07.615 --> 04:09.581
Wow, you really know
what you're doing.

04:09.583 --> 04:10.849
Yeah.

04:10.851 --> 04:13.318
Well, I had a boyfriend
who was a mechanic.

04:13.320 --> 04:15.554
Walden and jenny:
A boyfriend?

04:15.556 --> 04:18.223
Yeah. Well, I went through
a phase where I dated guys.

04:18.225 --> 04:20.125
Huh, I thought
you were a <i>gold</i> star.

04:20.127 --> 04:21.727
What's a "gold star"?

04:21.729 --> 04:24.630
It's a lesbian term for someone
who's never been with a guy.

04:24.632 --> 04:26.965
Hey, I'm a gold star.

04:28.234 --> 04:30.202
Wait a second,
what about that story

04:30.204 --> 04:32.838
About you skinny-dipping
at boy scout camp?

04:32.840 --> 04:34.273
Well, I was drowning.

04:34.275 --> 04:36.275
I had to grab ahold
of something.

04:36.277 --> 04:37.843
Just happened to be roger.

04:37.845 --> 04:41.346
So, if you had met walden
instead of me...

04:41.348 --> 04:43.315
Oh, god, no.
(chuckles)

04:43.317 --> 04:44.683
Wow, great.

04:44.685 --> 04:47.085
I'm getting hypothetical
rejections now.

04:47.087 --> 04:48.820
I'm sorry,
you're just not my type.

04:48.822 --> 04:51.490
I was more into,
you know, "guy" guys.

04:51.492 --> 04:53.759
I'm a "guy" guy.

04:53.761 --> 04:55.127
Oh, please.

04:55.129 --> 04:57.796
You made me come in your room
to kill a spider.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.431
I'm allergic!

04:59.433 --> 05:01.233
(chuckles):
Look, it's not a big deal.

05:01.235 --> 05:02.868
Some guys fix things
and some guys

05:02.870 --> 05:05.337
Call the guys that fix things.

05:05.339 --> 05:07.339
You know, right after
they watch <i>project runway.</i>

05:07.341 --> 05:10.008
Oh, I didn't see it last night.
Don't tell me, don't tell me.

05:10.010 --> 05:11.610
I rest my case.

05:11.612 --> 05:12.911
You know what, I'll show you.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.012
Here, give me that.

05:14.014 --> 05:15.847
Okay.

05:15.849 --> 05:18.617
Tell me I'm not a guy's guy.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.652
I got "guy"
coming out of my ass.

05:22.088 --> 05:24.456
Don't... (scoffs)
you know what I meant.

05:24.458 --> 05:25.757
(groans)

05:25.759 --> 05:27.793
God, these nuts
are hard to get off.

05:29.395 --> 05:31.930
Oh, okay, I'll give you
that one. (laughs)

05:35.201 --> 05:36.201
Hey, jeff.

05:36.203 --> 05:37.436
Hey, there he is.

05:37.438 --> 05:40.072
The b-f-f of j-e-f-f.

05:40.074 --> 05:41.239
(both laugh)
that's pretty good.

05:41.241 --> 05:42.741
Did you just
come up with that?

05:42.743 --> 05:44.409
What do you think,
I just sat here

05:44.411 --> 05:46.445
Jotting down rhymes
before you showed up?

05:48.381 --> 05:49.748
I'll have a whiskey.

05:49.750 --> 05:52.150
Oh, oh, we're doing
the hard stuff. Okay.

05:52.152 --> 05:54.720
I'll have three fingers
of crème de menthe.

05:54.722 --> 05:57.456
Yeah, I've just been
kind of in a funk lately.

05:57.458 --> 05:58.457
What's going on?

05:58.459 --> 05:59.491
It's lyndsey.

05:59.493 --> 06:01.393
Mm, lyndsey. Lyndsey.

06:01.395 --> 06:02.661
I'm sorry, uh,

06:02.663 --> 06:04.396
Lyndsey is...?
My girlfriend.

06:04.398 --> 06:07.299
Oh, yes, yes. You know,
I-I can never remember her name,

06:07.301 --> 06:10.135
Because, you know,
I never really knew her.

06:10.137 --> 06:12.070
Doesn't matter.
Anyway, she dumped me.

06:12.072 --> 06:13.071
She dumped you?!

06:13.073 --> 06:15.140
(laughs):
Oh, my god!

06:15.142 --> 06:16.708
Oh, my god.

06:16.710 --> 06:19.811
I was so shocked,
my first reaction was wrong.

06:19.813 --> 06:22.714
Yeah, well, it's been
a really rough two weeks.

06:22.716 --> 06:23.815
Wait, two weeks?

06:23.817 --> 06:25.117
You-you guys have been
broken up for two weeks

06:25.119 --> 06:26.518
And this is the first
I'm hearing about it?

06:26.520 --> 06:28.487
Oh, I'm sorry, buddy.
I should have told you sooner.

06:28.489 --> 06:32.157
Well, someone
certainly should have.

06:32.159 --> 06:33.625
Anyway, there is
one bright side:

06:33.627 --> 06:35.327
At least now, you and I
are free to hang

06:35.329 --> 06:37.329
Whenever we want.
We couldn't before?

06:37.331 --> 06:40.599
Well, I-I didn't really
want to tell you this, but...

06:40.601 --> 06:42.234
Lyndsey didn't
like you very much.

06:42.236 --> 06:44.569
She said that?

06:44.571 --> 06:46.838
Yeah, she'd go on and on about
your hair and your clothes.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.807
She even said you had
the worst taste in jewelry.

06:48.809 --> 06:50.242
I don't know where she got that.

06:50.244 --> 06:52.444
I mean, it's not like
you ever bought her jewelry.

06:52.446 --> 06:54.413
That's true.

06:54.415 --> 06:56.148
Although, if I had,
she wouldn't have noticed

06:56.150 --> 06:59.217
Unless I put it in
the bottom of her wine glass.

06:59.219 --> 07:00.218
Women.

07:00.220 --> 07:01.887
I know how to
kill this pain.

07:01.889 --> 07:03.021
Bring me the bottle.

07:03.023 --> 07:04.256
Yeah, better make it two.

07:04.258 --> 07:06.158
Ooh, and a little
whipped cream.

07:06.160 --> 07:07.592
(chuckles)

07:10.696 --> 07:12.664
Oh, hey, berta,
can I ask you a question?

07:12.666 --> 07:13.665
Yeah.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.500
I'm a man's man, right?

07:15.502 --> 07:18.136
I thought that
when I first met you,

07:18.138 --> 07:21.273
But then I found out
you were married to a woman.

07:21.275 --> 07:24.109
No... No, I mean, like...

07:24.111 --> 07:26.178
Like, I'm a guy who can...

07:26.180 --> 07:28.780
Build things and...

07:28.782 --> 07:32.184
A guy who can get horses
out of mud and...

07:33.820 --> 07:37.622
...Who, if-if he gets stabbed,
he just rubs dirt in it.

07:37.624 --> 07:40.025
You're talking about
a guy's guy?

07:40.027 --> 07:42.828
One of those dudes, like,
in the boner pill commercials?

07:42.830 --> 07:43.895
Yeah, exactly.

07:43.897 --> 07:46.531
Yeah.
You're not one of those.

07:46.533 --> 07:47.833
What?

07:47.835 --> 07:49.868
Well, you're more like
one of those guys

07:49.870 --> 07:51.303
That gets a mani-pedi.

07:51.305 --> 07:52.871
Yeah, well, first of all,

07:52.873 --> 07:55.307
There is nothing wrong
with taking care of yourself.

07:55.309 --> 07:56.575
And second of all,

07:56.577 --> 08:00.545
Manicure has the word "man,"
like, right there in it.

08:00.547 --> 08:02.747
Well, now, you calm down
manly man,

08:02.749 --> 08:04.816
Or you're gonna spill
your chamomile tea.

08:04.818 --> 08:08.086
At least I'm the manliest man
in this house, right?

08:08.088 --> 08:09.154
Um...

08:10.122 --> 08:11.256
What?

08:11.258 --> 08:12.891
Really? I'm under alan?

08:12.893 --> 08:15.994
Well, do you want
to be on top of him?

08:16.963 --> 08:18.463
What did jenny tell you?

08:18.465 --> 08:20.532
I was drowning!

08:26.973 --> 08:28.540
'sup, ladies?

08:30.977 --> 08:34.145
Hey, look who it is:
Bob the builder.

08:36.115 --> 08:38.350
Oh, yeah,
it's pretty manly, huh?

08:38.352 --> 08:40.051
The only thing
manlier would be

08:40.053 --> 08:42.821
If you were dressed
as the cop or the cowboy.

08:43.956 --> 08:46.858
♪ why... Are you gay?

08:48.594 --> 08:50.795
Is this about
the flat tire?

08:50.797 --> 08:52.297
'cause you have
nothing to prove.

08:52.299 --> 08:53.899
Oh, I ain't provin' nothin'.

08:53.901 --> 08:55.166
Just being a guy.

08:55.168 --> 08:57.102
Doin' what guys do,
fixin' things.

08:57.104 --> 08:58.336
And do not expect me

08:58.338 --> 09:00.272
To get in touch with my emotions

09:00.274 --> 09:03.074
Or ask for directions
anytime soon.

09:03.076 --> 09:04.376
(spits)

09:04.378 --> 09:06.778
Is that chewing tobacco?

09:06.780 --> 09:08.313
Yes, it is.

09:09.248 --> 09:11.082
And it tastes terrible.

09:12.518 --> 09:15.353
And I'm feeling dizzy.

09:15.355 --> 09:17.556
Wow, very impressive.

09:17.558 --> 09:18.590
(laughs)

09:18.592 --> 09:21.593
You ain't seen nothing yet.

09:21.595 --> 09:23.061
That there's a laser.

09:23.063 --> 09:25.263
Badass.

09:27.199 --> 09:30.135
Gee, oh, this here table
is two degrees from being level.

09:31.103 --> 09:32.604
I got this!

09:37.109 --> 09:39.144
There we go,
job well done.

09:45.284 --> 09:47.619
I'm gonna need my band saw.

09:47.621 --> 09:49.020
You two clean this up.

19:34.274 --> 19:36.340
I'm sorry.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.676
Larry: You know what?
Forget her.

19:38.678 --> 19:42.480
If she chose some jackass over
you, she's just a dumb whore.

19:44.116 --> 19:46.184
Uh, she's-she's
actually really great.

19:46.186 --> 19:47.318
No, she's not.

19:47.320 --> 19:50.621
She and her new man
are both garbage.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.190
(groans):
Uh...

19:52.192 --> 19:53.891
♪ <i>men.</i> ♪

20:01.166 --> 20:03.100
Whoa, look at this.

20:03.102 --> 20:05.336
That's right.

20:05.338 --> 20:06.704
Hey, uh,

20:06.706 --> 20:08.472
Who has one and a half thumbs

20:08.474 --> 20:10.808
And built this deck
all by himself?

20:10.810 --> 20:12.910
This guy.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.478
Well, I'm impressed.

20:14.480 --> 20:16.414
I would've had
to call a guy.

20:16.416 --> 20:18.249
Well, then my phone
would've rang,

20:18.251 --> 20:20.318
Because I <i>am</i> the guy.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.553
Got to admit, I was
wrong about you.

20:22.555 --> 20:25.957
That's all right.
We all make mistakes.

20:25.959 --> 20:28.192
Oh! That's my spit cup.

20:29.528 --> 20:32.863
This thing feels sturdy enough
for us to have sex on later.

20:32.865 --> 20:33.998
Walden:
Oh, it is.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.399
But, uh, be careful,

20:35.401 --> 20:37.168
'cause I just
stained her.

20:37.170 --> 20:39.837
Well, if you hadn't,
we would have.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.543
Ah. Look at that.

20:45.545 --> 20:49.013
Looks like somebody
needs a new roof.

20:49.015 --> 20:51.349
Luckily, I know a guy.
(chuckles)

20:51.351 --> 20:53.417
(wood crackling)

21:01.393 --> 21:04.061
Whoa. Walden?

21:04.063 --> 21:05.630
Walden:
Call a guy!
