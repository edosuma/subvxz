WEBVTT

00:02.429 --> 00:03.128
You guys are screwing

00:03.196 --> 00:03.895
Each other.

00:03.963 --> 00:05.162
You really don't give

00:05.230 --> 00:06.162
A shit about me.

00:06.229 --> 00:07.362
I tried.

00:07.430 --> 00:08.362
Stop it, please--

00:08.430 --> 00:10.232
No, i won't stop--not until

00:10.300 --> 00:11.869
We're together again.

00:11.937 --> 00:13.004
I am pregnant.

00:13.071 --> 00:15.004
It's sean's sperm.

00:15.071 --> 00:15.835
And this is?

00:15.902 --> 00:16.999
Ramona--my fiancee.

00:17.067 --> 00:18.265
I'm gonna work for her father

00:18.333 --> 00:19.699
In his carpet business.

00:19.766 --> 00:20.833
Matt doesn't want either

00:20.901 --> 00:22.167
Of you in his life anymore.

00:22.235 --> 00:23.135
The whole therapy thing

00:23.203 --> 00:23.903
Is bullshit.

00:23.970 --> 00:24.702
You're right.

00:24.770 --> 00:27.724
We should just end it, end us.

00:33.228 --> 00:34.859
Ok. you ok there, dad?

00:34.927 --> 00:35.893
Yeah. yeah.

00:35.960 --> 00:37.327
Ok.

00:37.394 --> 00:39.495
Heh heh.

00:39.563 --> 00:40.928
So, mr. and mrs. krieger,

00:40.996 --> 00:41.828
Tell me what you don't like

00:41.896 --> 00:42.829
About yourself? i see you're

00:42.896 --> 00:44.430
Both booked for the consult.

00:44.497 --> 00:49.365
We want our tattoos removed.

00:49.432 --> 00:51.433
Oh. this strikes me as

00:51.501 --> 00:53.102
A very big decision.

00:53.170 --> 00:55.470
Yes. well, it first occurred

00:55.537 --> 00:58.272
To me when i was watching this

00:58.340 --> 01:00.876
Documentary on the tv about

01:00.943 --> 01:03.378
Buchenwald. and suddenly, i was

01:03.446 --> 01:05.713
Overwhelmed. and i thought,

01:05.780 --> 01:08.748
Well, we have lived such a great

01:08.816 --> 01:11.251
Life. we've survived so much

01:11.318 --> 01:14.619
Since then. so, i--i want to

01:14.687 --> 01:17.289
Erase this obsession with

01:17.356 --> 01:19.557
Terrible things from the past.

01:19.625 --> 01:21.392
you can see,

01:21.460 --> 01:24.162
She--she's a remarkable woman.

01:24.229 --> 01:25.162
That's not what you said

01:25.230 --> 01:26.496
In the car, dad.

01:26.564 --> 01:28.198
Allie, please. shh.

01:28.265 --> 01:29.933
How can i keep my mouth shut

01:30.000 --> 01:31.501
When holocaust deniers are

01:31.568 --> 01:33.402
More vocal than ever?

01:33.469 --> 01:35.203
When so many survivors have

01:35.271 --> 01:37.638
Passed, why would you want to

01:37.706 --> 01:39.739
Erase one single reminder?

01:39.807 --> 01:41.373
My daughter is upset, and

01:41.441 --> 01:43.341
I understand. she has

01:43.409 --> 01:45.009
A different perspective.

01:45.077 --> 01:46.610
And you, walter? are you sure

01:46.678 --> 01:48.245
This is what you want?

01:48.313 --> 01:50.414
At the end of the day, i want

01:50.481 --> 01:53.883
What edith wants.

01:53.951 --> 01:56.719
She is my inspiration. this will

01:56.787 --> 01:59.588
Be a chance, a second chance,

01:59.655 --> 02:01.989
For some joy. and i can give it

02:02.057 --> 02:03.790
To her?

02:03.858 --> 02:06.493
Yes. take--take it off.

02:06.560 --> 02:07.427
You need to be aware that,

02:07.495 --> 02:09.262
Uh, the work on the elderly is

02:09.330 --> 02:10.963
Not as simple. the skin is much

02:11.031 --> 02:12.498
Thinner, healing takes longer,

02:12.566 --> 02:14.499
And infection is always

02:14.567 --> 02:15.500
A possibility.

02:15.568 --> 02:17.969
Doctor, after what we've been

02:18.037 --> 02:22.640
Through, please. this is bupkis.

02:22.708 --> 02:24.642
Yeah.

03:15.917 --> 03:17.117
God. these new corporate

03:17.184 --> 03:18.318
Taxes are killing our bottom

03:18.385 --> 03:19.652
Line. for every set of implants

03:19.719 --> 03:20.852
We do, it's like uncle sam gets

03:20.920 --> 03:22.287
One titty for himself.

03:22.354 --> 03:23.354
Still, it's a pretty good

03:23.422 --> 03:24.989
Net, all things considered.

03:25.056 --> 03:26.923
I guess you're right...

03:26.991 --> 03:28.725
For those tax returns over

03:28.792 --> 03:30.192
The years.

03:30.260 --> 03:31.927
Well, i should get going.

03:33.529 --> 03:34.963
You can get all that stuff

03:35.031 --> 03:36.030
To the accountant, all right?

03:36.098 --> 03:36.864
You're not staying? i got

03:36.932 --> 03:37.598
Dinner coming.

03:37.666 --> 03:39.833
No. i'd love to, but, uh...

03:39.901 --> 03:44.670
Maybe some other time.

03:44.738 --> 03:46.072
Uh, hey.

03:46.140 --> 03:47.740
Hey.

03:47.808 --> 03:49.141
Uh, can i come in?

03:49.209 --> 03:50.342
Hey, matty. you brought

03:50.410 --> 03:51.243
Enough for 3, right?

03:51.310 --> 03:52.076
Yeah, of course.

03:52.144 --> 03:55.746
Ok.

03:55.813 --> 03:56.947
yeah.

03:57.014 --> 03:57.880
Is this some kind of setup?

03:57.948 --> 03:58.714
I don't know what you're

03:58.782 --> 04:00.182
Talking about.

04:00.249 --> 04:01.283
Wow. smells good.

04:01.350 --> 04:02.483
Yeah. ramona's been cooking

04:02.551 --> 04:03.451
All day.

04:04.686 --> 04:06.053
Ok. i guess i'm staying

04:06.120 --> 04:07.153
For a bite.

04:07.221 --> 04:09.555
Good. i'll get some plates.

04:09.622 --> 04:11.056
So, your fiancee cooked all

04:11.124 --> 04:11.856
Of this?

04:11.924 --> 04:12.957
Yeah. she was just trying to

04:13.025 --> 04:14.325
Support me. and after we heard

04:14.393 --> 04:15.993
What happened at the shrink's

04:16.060 --> 04:18.130
Office, you know--oh. uh, she

04:18.197 --> 04:20.567
Actually wanted me to bring you

04:20.636 --> 04:23.610
Both this.

04:23.677 --> 04:28.618
What is it?

04:28.686 --> 04:30.052
It's in spanish.

04:30.120 --> 04:30.919
I don't know what...

04:30.987 --> 04:33.655
Oh. uh, let's see. it says,

04:33.723 --> 04:35.656
Uh, "please join us in

04:35.724 --> 04:37.458
Celebrating the marriage of our

04:37.525 --> 04:38.825
Daughter ramona perez and

04:38.893 --> 04:41.194
Matt mcnamara. casual attire,"

04:41.261 --> 04:42.828
Then something about parking

04:42.896 --> 04:44.563
Instructions. i don't know.

04:44.631 --> 04:46.431
I, uh, started learning spanish.

04:46.499 --> 04:47.766
I want jenna to be bilingual,

04:47.833 --> 04:49.233
Especially since half her family

04:49.301 --> 04:50.434
Is gonna be speaking it soon.

04:50.502 --> 04:51.468
So, you're inviting us to

04:51.536 --> 04:52.403
Your wedding, yeah?

04:52.470 --> 04:53.136
Yeah.

04:53.204 --> 04:54.070
I thought you didn't want us

04:54.138 --> 04:55.838
In your life anymore.

04:55.906 --> 04:57.940
Ramona has made me see just

04:58.007 --> 04:59.441
How important family is.

05:04.213 --> 05:05.146
I was on the can all night

05:05.214 --> 05:05.981
After those tamales.

05:06.048 --> 05:06.815
I know. i even had mine

05:06.883 --> 05:09.117
For breakfast.

05:09.185 --> 05:09.952
She's mine.

05:10.020 --> 05:10.953
Oh, you think so?

05:11.021 --> 05:13.956
Yup.

05:14.023 --> 05:15.424
Good morning.

05:15.491 --> 05:17.625
How can we help you, miss?

05:19.000 --> 05:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:29.045 --> 05:30.545
I know you like 'em young, ava,

05:30.613 --> 05:31.513
But shouldn't you at least wait

05:31.580 --> 05:33.648
For his testicles to descend?

05:33.715 --> 05:36.250
His name is rafael. he's my

05:36.318 --> 05:37.351
Adopted son.

05:37.419 --> 05:38.619
As i recall, you left your

05:38.686 --> 05:39.753
Last son on the floor to

05:39.821 --> 05:41.287
Decompose while you dashed off

05:41.355 --> 05:42.854
To gay paris.

05:42.922 --> 05:45.090
After i left, i, uh,

05:45.157 --> 05:47.158
I rented a small pencione in

05:47.226 --> 05:50.927
Le quartier latin where i wept

05:50.995 --> 05:54.562
For days. weeks passed before

05:54.630 --> 05:55.930
I received a letter from

05:55.998 --> 05:57.998
Baltimore. adrian's death had

05:58.066 --> 06:00.667
Been determined to be a suicide,

06:00.734 --> 06:03.269
Which it was. i was cleared of

06:03.337 --> 06:04.539
All wrongdoing.

06:04.607 --> 06:05.808
So, naturally, you jumped on

06:05.876 --> 06:07.445
The next plane back to miami to

06:07.513 --> 06:09.347
Give your son a proper burial.

06:09.415 --> 06:11.782
I used my grief as fuel

06:11.850 --> 06:12.750
To move on.

06:12.817 --> 06:13.684
Adrian was covered

06:13.751 --> 06:14.484
In maggots.

06:14.552 --> 06:15.819
Stop!

06:15.887 --> 06:18.788
Please. have a little decency.

06:18.855 --> 06:19.822
I don't think you should be

06:19.890 --> 06:21.490
Lecturing us on decency.

06:21.558 --> 06:22.525
Look. whatever you're here

06:22.593 --> 06:24.593
For, there's no procedure we

06:24.661 --> 06:26.127
Could do that dr. moore couldn't

06:26.195 --> 06:29.030
Do just as well.

06:29.098 --> 06:32.467
Barrett's dead.

06:32.535 --> 06:36.637
Series of strokes.

06:36.705 --> 06:38.105
I am not the monster you think

06:38.173 --> 06:40.107
I am. all my life, i've tried

06:40.174 --> 06:41.674
To turn tragedy into something

06:41.742 --> 06:43.742
Meaningful. i started

06:43.810 --> 06:45.010
A foundation with the money

06:45.078 --> 06:46.978
Barrett left me that subsidizes

06:47.046 --> 06:48.479
Corrective surgery for

06:48.547 --> 06:51.148
Third-world children.

06:58.323 --> 07:00.424
Leishmaniasis.

07:00.491 --> 07:03.559
It looks like leprosy.

07:03.627 --> 07:05.695
Black fever, jericho buttons,

07:05.762 --> 07:07.163
The same thing. it's endemic

07:07.231 --> 07:09.098
In areas around the amazon.

07:09.166 --> 07:11.267
Amphotericin b, i think, is

07:11.335 --> 07:12.935
The recommended treatment.

07:13.003 --> 07:14.603
Side effects are horrible,

07:14.671 --> 07:16.438
Often lethal in a child his age.

07:17.440 --> 07:18.907
Would he survive? my brave

07:18.975 --> 07:21.109
Little rafael? he's free of

07:21.177 --> 07:22.911
The parasite, but as you can

07:22.979 --> 07:25.280
See, it's left its mark.

07:25.348 --> 07:26.848
So, why bring him to us?

07:26.916 --> 07:28.350
Because you're the best, and

07:28.417 --> 07:31.419
I want what's best for my son.

07:31.487 --> 07:32.587
You'd do the same for matt,

07:32.655 --> 07:33.621
Wouldn't you?

07:33.689 --> 07:34.588
You know, why don't you leave

07:34.656 --> 07:35.689
Your contact information at

07:35.757 --> 07:36.790
The desk, and we'll send you

07:36.858 --> 07:38.058
A list of referrals?

07:38.126 --> 07:39.059
And please don't ever talk

07:39.127 --> 07:42.061
About matt again.

07:47.700 --> 07:49.167
Rafael's only crime was being

07:49.234 --> 07:50.936
Born into poverty. and now he's

07:51.004 --> 07:53.972
Scarred for life. i'm trying

07:54.039 --> 07:57.575
To give him a second chance.

07:57.643 --> 07:58.742
Perhaps you think that

07:58.810 --> 07:59.943
Beverly hills matrons who come

08:00.011 --> 08:01.111
To you for face-lifts are

08:01.179 --> 08:04.113
More deserving.

08:12.888 --> 08:15.723
we're not doing it.

08:15.791 --> 08:17.758
Don't get carried away.

08:17.826 --> 08:19.626
She's evil. that baby is just

08:19.694 --> 08:21.494
A sick child. and it is

08:21.562 --> 08:22.595
Intriguing from a medical

08:22.663 --> 08:23.496
Point of view.

08:23.564 --> 08:24.730
Look. i know you and i try to

08:24.798 --> 08:25.765
Mend fences and all that

08:25.832 --> 08:26.999
Bullshit. i get it, ok? but

08:27.067 --> 08:28.133
I don't give a shit if ava comes

08:28.201 --> 08:30.669
In here with baby jesus himself.

08:30.736 --> 08:33.337
We're not helping her.

08:41.645 --> 08:44.381
All right. this procedure

08:44.448 --> 08:46.883
Will only take about 20 minutes,

08:46.950 --> 08:48.384
As soon as our anesthesiologist

08:48.452 --> 08:49.852
Gets off the phone.

08:49.920 --> 08:51.353
Where are my tunes?

08:51.421 --> 08:52.387
Ok, i'm sorry. that was my

08:52.455 --> 08:53.888
Gynecologist. i just got my

08:53.956 --> 08:56.290
Cvs results. my baby is perfect.

08:56.358 --> 08:58.959
Oh, mazel tov. how far along

08:59.027 --> 09:00.160
Are you, darling?

09:00.228 --> 09:02.395
I am 12 weeks, just past my

09:02.463 --> 09:03.329
First trimester.

09:03.397 --> 09:04.263
Can we dial down

09:04.331 --> 09:05.398
The estrogen, please, and get

09:05.465 --> 09:06.432
My music cranking?

09:06.499 --> 09:10.002
The machine's on the fritz.

09:10.069 --> 09:12.604
Dr. troy, could i sing a song

09:12.671 --> 09:15.373
For my wife? it will relax her.

09:15.441 --> 09:18.576
Fine by me.

10:08.287 --> 10:08.920
Hmm.

10:08.987 --> 10:09.787
I didn't think you weren't

10:09.855 --> 10:11.255
Coming into town for a few days.

10:12.391 --> 10:13.558
You look great, julia.

10:13.625 --> 10:14.592
Thank you, christian.

10:14.660 --> 10:15.927
You haven't changed a bit.

10:15.994 --> 10:16.928
Thanks.

10:16.995 --> 10:18.129
So, where are connor

10:18.196 --> 10:19.296
And annie?

10:19.364 --> 10:21.232
Uh, they're at the hotel.

10:21.299 --> 10:22.967
I thought it best that i came

10:23.034 --> 10:24.201
To see you first.

10:24.269 --> 10:25.069
Oh, you gotta see my new

10:25.136 --> 10:26.403
Apartment. there's plenty of

10:26.471 --> 10:27.838
Room. you guys could stay there.

10:27.906 --> 10:28.806
It's probably easier than

10:28.873 --> 10:31.575
A hotel.

10:31.643 --> 10:32.476
I'm getting married

10:32.544 --> 10:34.111
Again, sean. heh.

10:36.881 --> 10:40.083
Congrats. good for you.

10:40.151 --> 10:42.152
Is it 2 brides? 2 grooms?

10:42.220 --> 10:43.253
Woman? beast?

10:43.321 --> 10:45.655
His name's edmund, and, um,

10:45.723 --> 10:47.257
He lives in knightsbridge, in

10:47.324 --> 10:49.826
England. and he has an estate

10:49.894 --> 10:50.960
Somewhere that's been in

10:51.028 --> 10:52.729
The family for, like, 400 years.

10:53.597 --> 10:55.999
Uh, what about our kids?

10:56.066 --> 10:58.768
Um...

10:58.836 --> 11:00.369
I want them to come with me.

11:00.437 --> 11:02.105
Yeah, well, london is a

11:02.172 --> 11:06.009
10-hour flight from l.a., so...

11:06.076 --> 11:08.644
Yeah, i know. and, um,

11:08.712 --> 11:12.782
Well, i need your permission.

11:12.850 --> 11:13.950
You know, it's hard enough

11:14.017 --> 11:15.251
Finding time to fly across

11:15.318 --> 11:16.285
The country to see them. now

11:16.353 --> 11:17.219
I'm supposed to fly across

11:17.287 --> 11:19.121
The atlantic? they need their

11:19.189 --> 11:20.623
Father. ok?

11:20.691 --> 11:22.725
They need a stable family.

11:22.792 --> 11:23.993
Well, i'm not giving up

11:24.060 --> 11:25.794
My rights to my children just

11:25.862 --> 11:27.162
So you can play house

11:27.230 --> 11:30.933
6,000 miles away.

11:43.522 --> 11:44.188
* ain't no woman

11:44.256 --> 11:46.093
Like the one i've got *

11:46.161 --> 11:47.897
* every day, the sun... *

11:47.965 --> 11:49.398
It's bullshit, is what it is.

11:49.466 --> 11:50.466
I can't take a week off from

11:50.534 --> 11:51.400
Work every time i want to see

11:51.468 --> 11:53.301
My kids. it's not realistic. and

11:53.369 --> 11:54.302
What about the time difference?

11:54.370 --> 11:55.336
If i don't call them by noon

11:55.404 --> 11:56.837
L.a. time, they'll be in bed.

11:56.904 --> 11:58.170
Can i get a 400?

11:58.238 --> 11:59.071
You know, whether we're

11:59.139 --> 12:00.672
Married or not, we still have

12:00.740 --> 12:02.339
To do what's best for the kids.

12:02.407 --> 12:03.607
And she's not remembering that.

12:03.674 --> 12:04.609
You know, i think that you're

12:04.676 --> 12:05.544
The one who's forgetting what

12:05.612 --> 12:06.979
This is about. you're really

12:07.047 --> 12:07.880
Losing her.

12:07.948 --> 12:08.614
Julia?

12:08.682 --> 12:09.282
Mm-hmm.

12:09.349 --> 12:10.181
What are you saying?

12:10.249 --> 12:11.113
Look, i know how you feel

12:11.181 --> 12:12.080
About the kids. but what you're

12:12.148 --> 12:13.515
Really pissed off about is,

12:13.583 --> 12:14.716
She's going. she's going for

12:14.784 --> 12:15.751
Good this time. and you still

12:15.818 --> 12:16.685
Love her.

12:16.753 --> 12:17.486
* ain't no woman

12:17.553 --> 12:18.720
Like the one i love *

12:21.424 --> 12:23.458
So, tell me about this guy.

12:23.525 --> 12:24.124
Ed?

12:24.192 --> 12:24.792
Mm-hmm.

12:24.859 --> 12:27.325
Um...well, he's a little

12:27.393 --> 12:30.127
Older than i am. he's very

12:30.195 --> 12:32.296
Intellectual. he reads a lot.

12:32.363 --> 12:34.297
He's, um, i don't know.

12:34.365 --> 12:36.299
He's charming.

12:36.366 --> 12:37.099
Rich?

12:37.167 --> 12:37.900
Oh!

12:37.967 --> 12:39.368
I hope. i don't want you

12:39.435 --> 12:40.769
Flitting off to london with some

12:40.836 --> 12:43.037
Kind of saggy-balled bookworm

12:43.105 --> 12:44.372
From barnes & noble.

12:44.440 --> 12:46.107
Well, let's just say he works

12:46.174 --> 12:47.874
Very hard, and his balls are

12:47.942 --> 12:48.975
Far from saggy.

12:49.043 --> 12:49.642
Good.

12:49.710 --> 12:50.310
Ok?

12:50.377 --> 12:51.110
Heh. ok.

12:53.546 --> 12:54.812
How pissed is sean?

12:54.878 --> 12:56.345
You are stealing his kids.

12:56.412 --> 12:59.380
I know. uh, we all have to

12:59.448 --> 13:00.848
Move on with our lives.

13:00.916 --> 13:01.849
You're getting no arguments

13:01.917 --> 13:03.084
From me. trust me. not on

13:03.151 --> 13:04.518
That one.

13:04.586 --> 13:09.323
Heh.

13:09.391 --> 13:11.692
You look great.

13:11.760 --> 13:13.495
Thank you.

13:13.563 --> 13:16.866
So do you.

13:17.669 --> 13:21.876
Thanks.

13:21.944 --> 13:24.877
How are you doing?

13:24.945 --> 13:25.945
In all honesty, this whole

13:26.012 --> 13:28.847
Sean thing's got me a little...

13:28.914 --> 13:30.081
You do know that he dragged me

13:30.148 --> 13:31.047
To couple therapy.

13:31.115 --> 13:32.114
then you know

13:32.182 --> 13:33.115
He's always gone through these

13:33.183 --> 13:34.517
Dark phases. you know he did

13:34.585 --> 13:35.952
When we were married.

13:36.020 --> 13:37.554
He--he gets through it.

13:37.622 --> 13:38.588
This time feels different,

13:38.655 --> 13:41.523
Though.

13:44.292 --> 13:46.292
You look great.

13:52.431 --> 13:54.698
I'll be right back.

14:03.504 --> 14:04.337
You want to know

14:04.405 --> 14:07.639
What's weird?

14:07.707 --> 14:09.142
Every time i see you, i get

14:09.209 --> 14:11.476
A hard-on.

14:11.544 --> 14:13.946
After all these years...

14:14.013 --> 14:15.347
Does it have to be you...

14:16.717 --> 14:17.985
When i can put it in my pants?

14:18.052 --> 14:21.455
Christian, stop.

14:21.523 --> 14:22.657
You're moving very, very

14:22.725 --> 14:23.993
Far away.

14:25.396 --> 14:27.831
* i can't let go... *

14:27.898 --> 14:29.832
Uhh.

14:33.737 --> 14:37.807
* i can't let go... *

14:37.874 --> 14:42.346
Ohh. oh, christian.

14:44.914 --> 14:46.849
Coming.

14:54.086 --> 14:55.352
I'd fire my receptionist

14:55.420 --> 14:56.486
If she gave out personal

14:56.554 --> 14:58.786
Information. but then again,

14:58.854 --> 15:01.752
I'm very persuasive. sorry. i,

15:01.820 --> 15:03.386
Uh, i should have called, but...

15:04.322 --> 15:05.288
You would have said no.

15:05.356 --> 15:07.490
I still could say no.

15:07.558 --> 15:08.858
To a woman with a baby who

15:08.925 --> 15:10.792
Needs your help?

15:10.860 --> 15:13.494
No, sean. you're not that man.

15:23.572 --> 15:25.272
You want a drink?

15:25.339 --> 15:28.007
No, thanks, but feel free.

15:28.075 --> 15:31.043
I know you had a hard day.

15:34.080 --> 15:34.946
You two should see

15:35.014 --> 15:36.848
A professional.

15:36.915 --> 15:38.082
And by "you two," i assume

15:38.149 --> 15:38.882
You mean--

15:38.950 --> 15:41.651
Your...other half.

15:41.719 --> 15:43.985
Notice i didn't say "better."

15:44.053 --> 15:46.655
Heh.

15:46.722 --> 15:49.324
Well, we're fine.

15:49.392 --> 15:51.059
You're either in denial,

15:51.126 --> 15:52.693
Or you're very selective about

15:52.761 --> 15:55.629
The reality you accept.

16:02.202 --> 16:03.769
He's beautiful.

16:03.836 --> 16:05.803
Yeah.

16:05.871 --> 16:09.374
He will be. but his spirit is

16:09.442 --> 16:13.146
Sheer radiance. so, we'll keep

16:13.213 --> 16:14.480
Looking for a doctor who will

16:14.548 --> 16:18.116
Help me...so that his

16:18.184 --> 16:21.052
Appearance can match the soul

16:21.120 --> 16:25.558
That's inside.

16:25.626 --> 16:29.028
I know you want to.

16:29.096 --> 16:30.363
There are so many children

16:30.431 --> 16:33.833
Who could use your help.

16:33.901 --> 16:35.968
It's your choice, you know?

16:36.036 --> 16:38.237
You don't need his approval.

16:38.305 --> 16:40.873
It just feels that way.

16:48.247 --> 16:51.383
Oh, look at you.

16:55.322 --> 16:57.123
I would need all of his medical

16:57.190 --> 16:59.091
Information--doctors' records,

16:59.159 --> 17:00.125
Blood workups...

17:00.193 --> 17:02.761
Um, i can try to find them.

17:02.829 --> 17:05.064
I've been moving around so much.

17:05.131 --> 17:06.531
No, just give me the name of

17:06.598 --> 17:07.365
The hospital where they gave him

17:07.433 --> 17:08.933
The amphotericin b, and i will

17:09.001 --> 17:13.837
Get in touch with them.

17:13.905 --> 17:16.339
Ava...

17:25.616 --> 17:26.915
Why don't you tell me how you

17:26.983 --> 17:29.586
Got this baby?

17:29.654 --> 17:32.690
I, uh, i told you.

17:32.757 --> 17:34.959
I should have known better

17:35.027 --> 17:37.295
Than to be taken in by you.

17:37.363 --> 17:39.364
Get out.

17:43.903 --> 17:45.436
They had one caretaker for

17:45.504 --> 17:49.207
50 babies--one. they let them

17:49.275 --> 17:51.208
Cry themselves to sleep.

17:51.276 --> 17:52.376
After weeks of doing nothing

17:52.444 --> 17:54.012
But crying and screaming and

17:54.080 --> 17:56.915
Wanting to be held...

17:56.982 --> 17:59.250
They learned to stop,

17:59.318 --> 18:02.522
To need nothing.

18:02.589 --> 18:03.956
Mothering a suicide didn't

18:04.024 --> 18:05.091
Make me a prime candidate

18:05.158 --> 18:07.092
For adoption.

18:07.160 --> 18:09.894
My past, it seems, hangs around

18:09.962 --> 18:12.096
My neck like a noose.

18:12.163 --> 18:15.097
I brought a small bag.

18:15.164 --> 18:16.664
Seen me with it before, so

18:16.732 --> 18:18.665
No one bothered to check it--

18:18.733 --> 18:22.132
Empty going in, and with this

18:22.199 --> 18:24.767
Beautiful...if damaged...

18:24.835 --> 18:25.968
little boy

18:26.036 --> 18:28.269
Coming out.

18:32.407 --> 18:35.242
Was it illegal? yes. but you

18:35.309 --> 18:37.844
Tell me. was it immoral?

18:37.912 --> 18:39.346
Should i have left him there?

18:39.413 --> 18:41.081
Scarred? malnourished?

18:41.148 --> 18:44.218
Virtually unadoptable?

18:44.286 --> 18:46.153
So he could grow up alone

18:46.221 --> 18:47.588
And outcast for the rest

18:47.656 --> 18:50.459
Of his life?

18:50.527 --> 18:51.626
like me?

18:51.694 --> 18:53.060
You're incapable of telling

18:53.127 --> 18:55.192
The truth.

18:59.430 --> 19:01.899
get out.

19:13.977 --> 19:14.910
Maybe i was wrong

19:14.978 --> 19:17.412
About you, sean.

19:17.480 --> 19:18.813
Whatever it is that keeps you

19:18.880 --> 19:21.414
So locked up and judgmental

19:21.482 --> 19:24.449
And unhappy...

19:24.517 --> 19:25.650
Maybe it's got nothing at all

19:25.718 --> 19:28.451
To do with christian.

19:41.929 --> 19:44.195
Oh. doctor, i'm so glad to

19:44.263 --> 19:46.162
See you. we had to take a bus,

19:46.230 --> 19:47.797
Because my daughter didn't

19:47.865 --> 19:49.398
Answer her phone.

19:49.466 --> 19:50.733
How you doing, walter?

19:57.004 --> 19:58.269
Get me a wheelchair.

19:58.337 --> 19:59.335
He woke up this morning.

19:59.403 --> 20:00.969
His arm was swollen like

20:01.036 --> 20:01.803
A balloon.

20:01.869 --> 20:02.669
I'm sure it's just a staph

20:02.737 --> 20:03.835
Infection. walter, you're gonna

20:03.902 --> 20:04.735
Come with me, all right? you're

20:04.803 --> 20:05.636
Gonna get up with me. we're

20:05.703 --> 20:06.503
Gonna get into the chair. ok?

20:07.504 --> 20:08.470
All right. here we go.

20:08.538 --> 20:09.304
We're gonna hook you up to

20:09.371 --> 20:10.605
An iv, get you into a bed.

20:10.672 --> 20:12.306
You should be fit as a fiddle

20:12.374 --> 20:14.775
In a couple of days.

20:14.842 --> 20:16.475
So, this is our finest

20:16.543 --> 20:18.410
Berber, perfect for high-traffic

20:18.478 --> 20:20.645
Areas such as your living room.

20:20.713 --> 20:24.615
Um, here. there you go.

20:24.682 --> 20:26.415
Take your shoes off.

20:26.483 --> 20:28.416
Run your toes through it.

20:28.484 --> 20:31.852
Ooh, i love it, tony.

20:31.919 --> 20:33.219
How is it with dog pee-pee?

20:33.287 --> 20:34.087
Don't start with that again,

20:34.154 --> 20:35.721
Anita, ok? because i'm pretty

20:35.789 --> 20:36.955
Happy with the linoleum.

20:37.023 --> 20:37.889
Yeah, but you said that when

20:37.957 --> 20:38.923
Your mom came to live with us

20:38.991 --> 20:40.057
That we were gonna be getting

20:40.125 --> 20:40.858
New carpeting.

20:40.925 --> 20:41.692
I know that, but i don't know

20:41.759 --> 20:42.526
Why you always have to

20:42.593 --> 20:43.393
Criticize...

20:49.131 --> 20:54.066
Hello, matt.

21:10.711 --> 21:13.178
What are you doing here?

21:13.245 --> 21:15.246
You look good, matt.

21:15.313 --> 21:16.146
Where have you been

21:16.214 --> 21:19.082
The past 6 years? i tried

21:19.149 --> 21:21.350
Looking for you.

21:21.418 --> 21:22.985
I always things to turn out

21:23.052 --> 21:24.319
Differently than they did.

21:24.387 --> 21:25.253

21:25.321 --> 21:26.421
3 days.

21:26.489 --> 21:28.589
I know. that's why i came.

21:28.657 --> 21:31.425
I, uh, i have a gift for you.

21:38.832 --> 21:41.734
That's a lot of money, ava.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.871
It's the least i can do after

21:43.938 --> 21:44.938
All the horrible tngs i've

21:45.006 --> 21:47.774
Done in the past.

21:47.842 --> 21:50.944
You deserve a fresh start.

21:51.012 --> 21:51.945
Is everythi all right,

21:52.013 --> 21:54.314
Matthew?

21:54.381 --> 21:56.282
Yeah, honey. hi. um--

Hi.

21:57.417 --> 21:59.418
Uh, this is ava moore,

21:59.485 --> 22:01.419
An old friend of the family.

22:01.487 --> 22:04.222
And she just came by, actually,

22:04.289 --> 22:06.924
To give us a wedding gift. ava,

22:06.992 --> 22:09.727
This is my fiancee ramona.

22:15.569 --> 22:16.669
And who is this precious

22:16.736 --> 22:17.970
Little thing?

22:18.038 --> 22:21.242
Uh, that's my daughter jenna.

22:21.309 --> 22:25.645
Hello, sweetheart.

22:25.713 --> 22:28.548
She's just perfect.

22:32.219 --> 22:33.652
Well, i think the three of you

22:33.720 --> 22:35.854
Make a wonderful family.

22:35.922 --> 22:38.823
I'm so happy for you.

22:38.891 --> 22:41.225
Well, thank you.

22:45.930 --> 22:48.131
I have, um, business back in

22:48.199 --> 22:49.066
Los angeles.

22:49.133 --> 22:50.601
Yeah. traffic gets pretty

22:50.669 --> 22:51.770
Bad around here. you might want

22:51.838 --> 22:56.182
Get on the road early.

22:56.249 --> 22:57.650
I hope your wedding is

22:57.717 --> 23:01.754
Everything you dream it will be.

23:01.822 --> 23:04.256
Bye, sweetheart.

23:21.207 --> 23:23.875
You good?

23:23.943 --> 23:26.778
Same shit, different day.

23:26.845 --> 23:28.446
You ok? you a little

23:28.513 --> 23:29.413
Hung over from your

23:29.481 --> 23:31.882
Bachelorette party with julia?

23:31.949 --> 23:36.885
Very hung over.

23:36.953 --> 23:38.386
Did you sleep with her?

23:38.454 --> 23:41.055
No. but it wasn't for

23:41.123 --> 23:44.325
Lack of trying.

23:44.393 --> 23:46.628
Christian, stop it. stop.

23:47.730 --> 23:49.898
No. no!

23:49.966 --> 23:52.433
I don't want this.

23:52.501 --> 23:54.102
I used to get butterflies

23:54.169 --> 23:57.237
Whenever you walked into a room,

23:57.305 --> 23:58.738
Or if you called the house to

23:58.806 --> 24:02.408
Talk to sean and i picked up.

24:02.476 --> 24:04.076
I thought about you when i was

24:04.144 --> 24:05.744
Making love to other men,

24:05.812 --> 24:09.514
Even sean.

24:09.582 --> 24:13.284
And i thought for one second

24:13.352 --> 24:17.721
That i felt that way tonight.

24:17.789 --> 24:20.257
But i don't.

24:20.325 --> 24:23.093
I still love you. but that thing

24:23.161 --> 24:26.262
That we had, that...

24:26.330 --> 24:30.367
Electricity...

24:30.434 --> 24:33.103
That's gone...

24:33.170 --> 24:36.038
Forever.

24:36.106 --> 24:40.976
Hmm.

24:41.043 --> 24:42.110
That's kind of a kick in

24:42.178 --> 24:42.944
The nuts, huh?

24:43.012 --> 24:44.947
Well, one you deserved.

24:45.014 --> 24:46.781
How could you do that? how could

24:46.849 --> 24:47.615
You do that to me?

24:47.683 --> 24:48.549
I don't know what you're

24:48.617 --> 24:49.350
Talking about.

24:49.417 --> 24:51.051
I spill my heart out to you.

24:51.119 --> 24:52.152
I tell you that i'm still in

24:52.220 --> 24:53.086
Love with her, and you try to

24:53.153 --> 24:54.153
Screw her in the bathroom of

24:54.221 --> 24:55.054
Some bar?

24:55.121 --> 24:56.021
Hey. you know what, buddy

24:56.089 --> 24:57.055
Boy? like it or not, there's

24:57.123 --> 24:58.823
3 of us. ok? i'm not saying

24:58.891 --> 25:00.792
It's a good thing, but i love

25:00.859 --> 25:02.026
Her, too.

25:02.093 --> 25:03.561
That's your justification?

25:03.628 --> 25:04.828
I'm sorry if this is hard for

25:04.896 --> 25:06.229
You to hear. if you want to hit

25:06.297 --> 25:07.697
Me or you want to quit or do

25:07.765 --> 25:08.831
Whatever it is that you like to

25:08.898 --> 25:10.065
Do, you just go for it, ok? but

25:10.133 --> 25:11.366
I'm not gonna apologize for what

25:11.434 --> 25:16.237
I did last night.

25:16.304 --> 25:18.272
You're right.

25:22.711 --> 25:24.044
We both need to have our own way

25:24.112 --> 25:26.580
With this.

25:34.922 --> 25:38.657
i'll be around

25:38.725 --> 25:40.326
At 9:00 to pick up the kids.

25:40.393 --> 25:41.993
If i'm gonna consider this,

25:42.061 --> 25:43.995
I think you should stay a bit.

25:44.062 --> 25:46.197
Seems the least you could do.

25:46.264 --> 25:47.565
Tell me a little bit about this

25:47.633 --> 25:51.136
New guy.

25:51.204 --> 25:53.038
Oh, come on.

25:53.106 --> 25:54.473
I won't bite.

25:54.541 --> 25:57.810
Hmm.

25:57.877 --> 25:59.811
Cheers.

26:10.122 --> 26:13.224
So, how did you meet

26:13.291 --> 26:14.825
This guy?

26:14.893 --> 26:18.562
Um...at a mutual friend's

26:18.630 --> 26:20.030
Dinner party.

26:20.097 --> 26:24.234
How did he propose?

26:24.302 --> 26:25.869
We were in bed.

26:25.936 --> 26:27.704
In bed?

26:27.772 --> 26:29.908
What, in the throes of passion?

26:29.975 --> 26:32.110
Julia, i don't think you thought

26:32.177 --> 26:33.111
This through very well.

26:33.178 --> 26:35.213
Sean, edmund and i have been

26:35.281 --> 26:36.781
Talking about marriage for a few

26:36.849 --> 26:38.617
Months. now, i know that it's

26:38.685 --> 26:39.985
Gonna be difficult for the kids

26:40.052 --> 26:42.254
Being in a new country, but

26:42.321 --> 26:44.357
He loves them. and they need

26:44.425 --> 26:45.592
Him, too, you know? they need

26:45.659 --> 26:46.926
A father who they can see

26:46.993 --> 26:50.963
Every day. and you know what?

26:51.031 --> 26:55.968
I can't do it alone anymore.

26:56.036 --> 27:00.707
Julia...

27:00.774 --> 27:03.042
I'll move to new york, and we

27:03.110 --> 27:05.212
Can all be together again.

27:05.280 --> 27:07.748
We were a happy family once.

27:07.815 --> 27:09.183
Just say the word, and we can

27:09.250 --> 27:13.754
Have it all back again.

27:13.822 --> 27:14.856
Oh...

27:14.923 --> 27:16.824
hey...

27:16.892 --> 27:19.394
I still love you. i've always

27:19.462 --> 27:23.898
Loved you. i never stopped.

27:23.966 --> 27:26.900
Julia, just stay with me

27:26.968 --> 27:28.802
Tonight. and i'll show you how

27:28.870 --> 27:29.636
Good we can be--

27:29.704 --> 27:30.637
Oh, my god.

27:30.705 --> 27:33.239
You and christian--you are

27:33.307 --> 27:36.442
Unbelievable.

27:36.510 --> 27:38.877
You've never changed. sean,

27:38.945 --> 27:40.245
You're both trying the same

27:40.313 --> 27:41.780
Trick--professing your love

27:41.848 --> 27:44.883
To me like 2 teenagers.

27:44.951 --> 27:48.519
I've grown up. i've moved on.

27:48.587 --> 27:50.387
It's time that you did, too.

27:55.460 --> 27:58.796
I'll pick up the kids at 9:00.

28:18.116 --> 28:20.984
Walter, when you were

28:21.052 --> 28:23.186
Delirious, you were talking in

28:23.254 --> 28:26.156
German. and you kept saying this

28:26.223 --> 28:30.025
One thing over and over. you

28:30.093 --> 28:32.527
Said, "what did we do to

28:32.595 --> 28:35.463
The children?" what were you

28:35.531 --> 28:36.498
Talking about?

28:36.566 --> 28:40.568
Oh...edith, i--i

28:40.636 --> 28:42.638
Wouldn't have known what it was.

28:42.706 --> 28:44.206
I was delirious, edith.

28:44.274 --> 28:45.874
No, no. there was

28:45.942 --> 28:49.778
Something...in your voice.

28:49.846 --> 28:52.014
There's something different.

28:52.081 --> 28:54.216
When you kept talking about

28:54.284 --> 28:56.384
The children, you said,

28:56.452 --> 29:00.722
"what did we," like you were

29:00.790 --> 29:01.757
One of them.

29:01.824 --> 29:02.557
Edith--

29:02.625 --> 29:04.059
Walter, please. tell me

29:04.127 --> 29:06.194
I'm afraid for nothing. tell me

29:06.262 --> 29:07.729
You don't know what i'm talking

29:07.797 --> 29:12.334
About. i didn't sleep all night.

29:12.402 --> 29:15.803
Walter, what did you do?

29:17.606 --> 29:18.806
I was--i was just

29:18.874 --> 29:20.442
A tattooist, edith.

29:20.509 --> 29:21.276
Ah!

29:21.344 --> 29:22.944
I was not the exterminator.

29:23.012 --> 29:24.379
Is everything all right here?

29:24.447 --> 29:26.448
No. is not all right.

29:26.516 --> 29:27.483
What are you talking about?

29:27.551 --> 29:29.986
I--i gave the prisoners

29:30.053 --> 29:31.254
The tattoos.

29:35.892 --> 29:37.890
Only the strong ones.

29:37.958 --> 29:39.423
It meant that they could go to

29:39.491 --> 29:42.724
Work. without a tattoo,

29:42.792 --> 29:44.425
They would be killed.

29:52.233 --> 29:54.968
When the war was over, and--

29:55.035 --> 29:56.870
I escaped to california.

29:56.938 --> 29:58.805
And i promised god to give me

29:58.873 --> 30:01.074
A second chance. if he would

30:01.142 --> 30:02.542
Give me a second chance, i would

30:02.610 --> 30:05.078
Live like a jew. as a penance,

30:05.145 --> 30:06.813
I--i lived with the people that

30:06.880 --> 30:09.281
I harmed. you see here?

30:09.349 --> 30:11.984
I gave myself--i gave myself

30:12.051 --> 30:12.985
A tattoo.

30:13.052 --> 30:15.887
And i was your penance?

30:15.955 --> 30:18.923
Edith, why i was given

30:18.991 --> 30:21.059
This gift, i do not know,

30:21.126 --> 30:24.462
But i was. god gave me you.

30:24.529 --> 30:27.464
God is a joke!

30:27.532 --> 30:30.100
Edith, does it count

30:30.167 --> 30:33.069
For nothing? hmm? what i have

30:33.137 --> 30:36.272
Become? how long i have been

30:36.340 --> 30:38.374
A good man? you always talk

30:38.442 --> 30:41.209
About forgiveness.

30:41.277 --> 30:42.576
Forgiveness, edith.

31:00.688 --> 31:05.624
Hi.

31:05.691 --> 31:09.960
I...

31:10.028 --> 31:12.562
I came to return this.

31:12.630 --> 31:13.963
Ramona's not comfortable

31:14.031 --> 31:18.966
Taking it. and neither am i.

31:19.033 --> 31:21.635
Such reverse snobbery.

31:25.841 --> 31:27.141
It would have been easier just

31:27.208 --> 31:28.575
To stick it in the ml,

31:28.643 --> 31:30.410
I would think.

31:30.478 --> 31:32.445
Yeah, well, i like to drive

31:32.513 --> 31:34.147
Around sometimes at night.

31:34.215 --> 31:36.683
It clears my head.

31:36.750 --> 31:38.518
Clarity's overrated.

31:38.586 --> 31:39.419
Hmm.

31:39.487 --> 31:40.553
Ramona wouldn't object to

31:40.621 --> 31:41.922
You just having one drink,

31:41.989 --> 31:44.791
Would she?

31:44.859 --> 31:47.194
Well, maybe just one.

31:47.262 --> 31:49.564
Good. ramona trusts you--

31:49.631 --> 31:51.266
A good precedent to begin one's

31:51.333 --> 31:53.568
Married life.

31:53.635 --> 31:55.570
Skol.

32:01.143 --> 32:03.645
You've grown older...

32:03.712 --> 32:06.815
Even more handsome.

32:06.883 --> 32:09.885
Love agrees with you.

32:09.952 --> 32:11.319
Ramona is very

32:11.387 --> 32:14.856
Down to earth...

32:14.924 --> 32:16.558
And nice.

32:16.625 --> 32:19.394
Good. you, um, you deserve

32:19.461 --> 32:20.762
Someone nice.

32:20.829 --> 32:22.964
You weren't very nice at all.

32:23.031 --> 32:24.632
Just incredibly--

32:24.700 --> 32:27.901
What?

32:27.969 --> 32:30.938
Beautiful.

32:31.005 --> 32:35.943
You still are.

32:36.010 --> 32:37.811
Thank you.

32:37.879 --> 32:41.014
I, uh...i needed that.

32:44.452 --> 32:45.786
You always did know exactly

32:45.853 --> 32:48.422
What to say.

33:36.300 --> 33:39.574
Sometimes in the dark,

33:39.641 --> 33:43.446
When i'm with her,

33:43.513 --> 33:47.182
I think about you.

33:47.250 --> 33:49.350
I fantasize what my life

33:49.418 --> 33:50.618
Would have been like if i'd

33:50.686 --> 33:53.855
Come away with you...

33:53.923 --> 33:56.958
If we'd been together.

Listen to me, matt.

33:59.261 --> 34:01.395

Saw me again. for your sake

34:19.344 --> 34:21.480
And ramona's, just put me out

34:21.547 --> 34:24.215
Of your mind.

34:32.623 --> 34:36.493
you can't go.

34:36.561 --> 34:38.896
I won't let you.

34:38.963 --> 34:41.400
I have no choice.

34:46.143 --> 34:48.411
My baby needs help.

35:00.186 --> 35:02.253
Hey. what are you doing here?

35:02.321 --> 35:03.120
Yeah. we don't need

35:03.188 --> 35:04.054
Any carpet.

35:04.122 --> 35:05.789
Oh, that's very funny,

35:05.857 --> 35:08.257
Actually. um, no. i wanted to

35:08.325 --> 35:09.191
Talk to you guys about

35:09.259 --> 35:12.393
Something--a wedding gift.

35:12.461 --> 35:14.495
I'd like you to do that surgery

35:14.563 --> 35:16.796
On ava's baby.

35:16.864 --> 35:18.798
Did she come to you? i knew

35:18.865 --> 35:20.298
We couldn't trust that bitch.

35:20.366 --> 35:21.800
She's not a bitch, man.

35:21.867 --> 35:24.468
Her kid's really messed up.

35:24.535 --> 35:25.935
Did you sleep with her?

35:29.172 --> 35:31.907
Matty, matty, matty.

35:31.974 --> 35:33.909
She's like a drug to you,

35:33.976 --> 35:35.610
As bad as meth. the second

35:35.678 --> 35:36.711
You're around her, you start

35:36.779 --> 35:38.012
Making bad decisions.

35:38.080 --> 35:39.480
Yeah, she seemed so

35:39.548 --> 35:40.481
Different, though, you know?

35:40.548 --> 35:42.215
Like being a real mom softened

35:42.283 --> 35:43.082
Her or something.

35:43.150 --> 35:43.983
I'm sure she was all

35:44.051 --> 35:45.417
Puppy dogs and rainbows until

35:45.485 --> 35:47.085
She casually asked you to talk

35:47.153 --> 35:48.653
To us about the surgery.

35:48.721 --> 35:50.421
Well...

35:50.488 --> 35:52.288
That was my idea.

35:52.356 --> 35:54.089
No. that was her idea.

35:54.157 --> 35:56.425
Matt, you've got a shot

35:59.664 --> 36:02.232
A great girl. ava is just gonna

36:02.299 --> 36:03.800
Toss you aside the second she's

36:03.867 --> 36:06.769
Done with you.

36:06.837 --> 36:10.872
Uh...

36:10.940 --> 36:12.640
I'm such an asshole, and she

36:12.708 --> 36:13.674
Sucked me right in.

36:13.742 --> 36:16.345
You're not an asshole.

36:16.413 --> 36:18.281
Come on, now. what you need

36:18.348 --> 36:23.118
To do is, uh, go home and

Get some sleep.

36:49.713 --> 36:50.913
Painkillers? he didn't give

36:50.980 --> 36:52.214
His victims any painkillers.

In washington.

37:04.893 --> 37:06.027
Is that part of the justice

37:06.094 --> 37:06.994
Department?

Yes. and if the evidence

Warrants it, mr. krieger,

37:10.732 --> 37:12.766

Stand trial for his crimes.
