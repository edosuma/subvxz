00:10.355 --> 00:13.489
It's like this family was cursed.

00:13.591 --> 00:16.626
I go outside, found
him in the truck, dead.

00:16.728 --> 00:20.963
What he gets off on is being seen.

00:21.066 --> 00:25.234
Every night, I see a shadow
coming down the hallway.

00:25.336 --> 00:27.837
I do hear pounding.

00:27.939 --> 00:31.107
There were some lynchings or murders.

00:31.209 --> 00:32.131
What is he trying to do?

00:32.231 --> 00:33.864
Kill them.

00:33.966 --> 00:37.601
They want to wreak havoc and chaos.

00:37.703 --> 00:39.736
There's a dark presence.

00:39.838 --> 00:42.205
My name is Amy Allan.

00:42.307 --> 00:44.207
These things, they're freaking out.

00:44.309 --> 00:45.375
They're from hell.

00:45.477 --> 00:46.676
I see dead people.

00:46.778 --> 00:48.011
They were being hunted.

00:48.113 --> 00:49.746
I speak to dead people.

00:49.848 --> 00:51.648
They were setting people on fire,

00:51.750 --> 00:52.749
burning them alive.

00:52.851 --> 00:53.884
And they speak to me.

00:53.986 --> 00:55.418
Her neck got broken.

00:55.521 --> 00:58.555
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:58.657 --> 01:00.557
I hear a gunshot.

01:00.659 --> 01:01.782
I rely on my partner.

01:01.882 --> 01:03.415
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:03.517 --> 01:05.250
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:05.352 --> 01:06.451
Something's not right here.

01:06.554 --> 01:09.788
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:09.890 --> 01:10.889
It's not safe here.

01:10.991 --> 01:12.357
It's my job to reveal them.

01:12.459 --> 01:14.159
Are any of them buried on the property?

01:14.261 --> 01:15.427
They're all buried here.

01:15.529 --> 01:17.262
But Steve and I never speak...

01:17.364 --> 01:19.298
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:19.400 --> 01:20.766
Until the very end...

01:20.868 --> 01:22.134
I can't do it no more.

01:22.236 --> 01:24.102
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:24.205 --> 01:25.904
Holy [bleep] Look at this.

01:26.006 --> 01:27.172
Or time to get out.

01:27.274 --> 01:28.841
It does not have a happy ending.

01:28.943 --> 01:31.109
Something kills people here.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.074

01:44.936 --> 01:46.202
I'm in Patricksburg, Indiana.

01:46.304 --> 01:49.661
It's a tiny, little town 70
miles southwest of Indianapolis.

01:51.064 --> 01:52.967
I got a call from a woman named Sonya.

01:53.067 --> 01:55.768
Now, she'd been in an
abusive relationship

01:55.870 --> 01:57.937
and finally got the courage
to grab her two daughters

01:58.039 --> 02:00.439
and get the hell out.

02:00.541 --> 02:01.807
Now here's where
the problem is...

02:01.909 --> 02:04.310
She moved back into the
house that she grew up in,

02:04.412 --> 02:06.479
and the abuse didn't stop.

02:06.581 --> 02:08.580
But this time, she's
being attacked by something

02:08.683 --> 02:09.487
she can't even see.

02:10.958 --> 02:14.493
Things are so bad, she's
living in an RV on the property

02:14.595 --> 02:15.961
just to avoid the house.

02:16.063 --> 02:17.662
This poor girl's been through a lot,

02:17.765 --> 02:20.165
and I really hope Amy
and I can help her out.

02:24.104 --> 02:25.604
Before Amy arrives,

02:25.706 --> 02:29.808
I clear the house of
any leading information,

02:29.910 --> 02:33.082
removing family photos and
covering personal items.

02:33.182 --> 02:34.314
When I'm finished,

02:34.416 --> 02:36.617
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

02:49.038 --> 02:50.470
Oh, boy.

02:50.573 --> 02:52.606
Uh, this isn't good.

02:52.708 --> 02:56.209
This probably isn't a good
place to build anything.

02:56.312 --> 03:00.069
It's like the earth literally
sucks the structures into it.

03:02.251 --> 03:05.152
It's almost like the earth devours them.

03:05.254 --> 03:08.322
There's a lot of mental illness there,

03:08.424 --> 03:13.013
and there's a lot of pain
inflicted upon others.

03:19.868 --> 03:20.834
Well, Sonya, I'm glad I'm here

03:20.936 --> 03:22.069
'cause you sounded
really bad on the phone.

03:23.516 --> 03:25.449
So let me get this
straight. You're living here?

03:25.551 --> 03:26.850
Yes.

03:26.953 --> 03:29.920
I'd rather live here in
the RV in the front yard

03:30.022 --> 03:32.022
than I would in their house, any day.

03:32.124 --> 03:33.691
I'm scared of that house.

03:33.793 --> 03:36.193
Now, where's your parents' house
in relation to where we are now?

03:36.295 --> 03:38.228
Up the hill, basically.

03:38.331 --> 03:40.497
Who's living where?

03:40.599 --> 03:42.800
This is all of us.

03:42.902 --> 03:44.568
This is my youngest daughter, Cassie.

03:44.670 --> 03:45.936
She's 13.

03:46.038 --> 03:47.071
This is myself.

03:47.173 --> 03:48.639
We live here.

03:48.741 --> 03:51.875
This is my mother,
Pam, and my father, Ted.

03:51.978 --> 03:53.110
And they live in the house.

03:53.212 --> 03:54.712
And my oldest daughter, Ashlyn,

03:54.814 --> 03:56.907
refused to even be on the property.

03:57.413 --> 03:58.745
What are you hoping we can do for you?

03:58.848 --> 04:01.949
My parents are planning on
finding a place down in Florida,

04:02.051 --> 04:03.684
and they've offered
me the house, which...

04:03.786 --> 04:05.652
I would love to have Cassie there,

04:05.754 --> 04:10.157
but I won't because I don't want
her childhood to be like mine.

04:10.259 --> 04:11.825
Okay. So let me get this straight.

04:11.927 --> 04:13.760
- You grew up in this house?
- Yes.

04:13.863 --> 04:15.028
Was the house haunted then?

04:15.130 --> 04:16.863
Yes.

04:16.966 --> 04:18.632
I swore I'd never come back here.

04:18.733 --> 04:21.567
But you had to come back to
escape an abusive relationship.

04:21.670 --> 04:22.703
Yes.

04:22.805 --> 04:25.739
It definitely took a
lot to get away from.

04:25.841 --> 04:27.708
This was my only option.

04:27.810 --> 04:29.510
So this was like a safe haven for you.

04:29.612 --> 04:30.811
So I thought.

04:30.913 --> 04:32.246
If you can, just give me a rundown

04:32.348 --> 04:34.314
of what everybody's
experiencing in the house.

04:34.416 --> 04:37.417
Voices, growling,

04:37.520 --> 04:41.755
things moving, the
fear of being watched.

04:41.857 --> 04:44.157
And there have been shadow people.

04:44.260 --> 04:46.994
There's been attacks,
people being touched.

04:50.339 --> 04:51.438
I can only imagine

04:51.540 --> 04:53.407
how tough this must be
for you to talk about.

04:53.509 --> 04:57.211
It's been a whirlwind of
emotions and, you know,

04:57.313 --> 04:58.712
I worry about my daughters.

04:58.814 --> 05:01.849
You know, I've lived with this
for... Well, I'm 35 years old.

05:01.951 --> 05:05.486
And since I was young,
it's haunted me, you know.

05:05.588 --> 05:06.587
Why? Why me?

05:06.689 --> 05:10.357
Why?

05:10.459 --> 05:15.095
I'm seeing this man, and
he's dressed in black.

05:15.197 --> 05:18.665
He is kind of wearing a cowboy outfit.

05:18.768 --> 05:22.236
He looks fairly young,
I would say in his 30s.

05:22.338 --> 05:23.537
He's pretty tough.

05:23.639 --> 05:26.373
And he's quiet, and
he's just standing there.

05:29.178 --> 05:31.546
He likes to be seen.

05:35.519 --> 05:38.098
He also likes this area a great deal.

05:39.246 --> 05:45.216
He is trying to experiment
with moving things

05:45.319 --> 05:48.468
and actually really hardcore
interact with the living.

05:49.775 --> 05:51.241
So, this is your backyard?

05:51.344 --> 05:52.977
Am I seeing what I think I'm seeing?

05:53.079 --> 05:54.111
Yes.

05:54.213 --> 05:55.913
This is a privately owned cemetery.

05:56.015 --> 05:57.748
As a child looking
out my bedroom window,

05:57.850 --> 05:58.974
this is what I saw.

06:02.221 --> 06:04.154
How do you feel
now, being in here?

06:04.256 --> 06:06.357
- I'm on edge being in here.
- Okay.

06:06.459 --> 06:07.558
So, what's going on?

06:07.660 --> 06:09.193
Well, we have a shadow

06:09.295 --> 06:12.730
that you actually see it every
night go down this hallway.

06:12.832 --> 06:14.965
Okay. So describe what it looks like.

06:15.067 --> 06:17.568
- Just a black mist, really.
- How big is it?

06:17.670 --> 06:18.936
How tall is it?

06:19.038 --> 06:20.974
I'd say about right
here, about five feet.

06:25.077 --> 06:26.944
The guy in black...

06:27.046 --> 06:32.349
people would see him as a
shadow person, without a doubt.

06:32.451 --> 06:35.052
He looks a lot shorter
when he's in that form

06:35.154 --> 06:38.989
than what he really is 'cause
he's probably about 5'10".

06:39.091 --> 06:40.994
But in the shadow-person form,

06:41.094 --> 06:46.431
he looks more, maybe,
about five foot and wider.

06:46.533 --> 06:48.166
He wants a lot of attention.

06:48.268 --> 06:52.036
What he gets off on is being seen.

06:52.138 --> 06:53.341
Okay. So, anything else going on?

06:53.810 --> 06:55.710
Uncontrollable crying.

06:55.812 --> 06:57.411
Cannot figure out why.

06:57.513 --> 06:59.680
From the time I woke up
to the time I went to bed,

06:59.782 --> 07:01.248
if I was in this house, I was sobbing.

07:01.351 --> 07:01.750
The whole day?

07:01.850 --> 07:05.018
Oh, the whole day,
until I went to the RV.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.753
And then, it just stopped.

07:06.855 --> 07:08.321
I'm not a psychologist,

07:08.423 --> 07:10.523
but you have bad
memories here growing up.

07:10.625 --> 07:11.791
Yes.

07:11.893 --> 07:15.328
But it's not that kind
of emotion, you know?

07:15.430 --> 07:19.799
It's not the feeling of losing someone.

07:19.901 --> 07:21.367
Okay. So, you've had
that kind of heartbreak?

07:21.469 --> 07:22.668
Yeah.

07:22.771 --> 07:26.372
A couple years ago, my
uncle had taken his own life.

07:26.474 --> 07:27.507
His name was Jeff.

07:27.609 --> 07:30.688
Actually... he's right here.

07:31.910 --> 07:33.516
He had lived here for a while.

07:33.616 --> 07:35.149
We were very, very close.

07:35.251 --> 07:37.451
Where did this happen?
Not in this house.

07:37.553 --> 07:39.053
But he did spend a lot of time here.

07:39.155 --> 07:41.555
- We were real tight.
- Yeah.

07:41.658 --> 07:42.556
How old was he when he passed?

07:42.659 --> 07:45.192
He would've been 45,
I think, when he died.

07:45.295 --> 07:47.094
Oh. So he was a young man.
What kind of guy was he?

07:47.196 --> 07:48.829
He just brought a smile
to everybody's face.

07:48.931 --> 07:49.897
If somebody was in a bad mood,

07:49.999 --> 07:51.532
he'd be the one to get you out of it.

07:51.634 --> 07:55.036
Never, ever, ever thought he
would do it, especially now,

07:55.138 --> 07:57.138
after he knew what we went through

07:57.240 --> 07:59.740
with my first husband
that took his own life,

07:59.842 --> 08:01.242
as well.

08:01.344 --> 08:02.910
He spent a lot of time here.

08:03.012 --> 08:06.080
And we got married and left
and moved in with his mother.

08:06.182 --> 08:08.182
And then, next thing I know,

08:08.284 --> 08:11.485
I go outside and couldn't find him

08:11.587 --> 08:14.722
and found him in the truck, dead.

08:14.824 --> 08:18.059
That's Raymond.

08:18.161 --> 08:19.627
How did he do it, if
you don't mind me asking?

08:19.729 --> 08:20.995
He shot himself in the head also.

08:21.097 --> 08:22.897
He died in '99.

08:22.999 --> 08:25.902
I hold a lot of guilt for both of them.

08:25.952 --> 08:26.884
Listen. Listen to me.

08:26.987 --> 08:28.186
Listen to me good. Okay?

08:28.288 --> 08:29.921
I learned one thing in life.

08:30.023 --> 08:31.823
If somebody wants to do
what your husband did,

08:31.925 --> 08:36.327
if they want to do that, nothing
you do is gonna change it.

08:36.429 --> 08:38.261
These are tortured souls
you're talking about here.

08:38.365 --> 08:40.365
I know. And I do know that.

08:40.467 --> 08:45.203
I do. I just can't tell my heart that.

08:45.305 --> 08:49.019
The cowboy guy... I do
see him with a handgun.

08:50.453 --> 08:54.269
He was pretty intimidating
when he was alive.

08:55.624 --> 09:00.491
He likes this space the most.

09:00.963 --> 09:04.178
There's a familiarity here with him.

09:06.902 --> 09:08.068
I don't trust this guy,

09:08.170 --> 09:11.538
and I think he's doing
very bad things in here.

09:15.744 --> 09:17.044
So, what's going on in here?

09:17.787 --> 09:21.202
I woke up one night to somebody
pushing at the end of the bed.

09:21.302 --> 09:24.203
I looked up, and in
between the wall and the bed

09:24.305 --> 09:27.873
was two hooded figures
that had no face, no eyes.

09:27.975 --> 09:30.142
And there was one at the end of my bed

09:30.244 --> 09:31.910
and one on the other side of my bed.

09:32.012 --> 09:34.913
And I woke up screaming bloody murder.

09:35.015 --> 09:37.449
And that was when my mom got
up out of bed, came in here.

09:37.551 --> 09:39.151
And I told her what had happened.

09:39.253 --> 09:41.753
And she immediately went
into my brother's room

09:41.856 --> 09:44.256
and was like, "Okay, Chad.
It's time to tell her."

09:44.358 --> 09:45.757
I'm like, "Tell me what?"

09:45.860 --> 09:48.193
You know, and that's when
they began to tell me that,

09:48.295 --> 09:50.662
you know, they had had
similar experiences.

09:50.764 --> 09:52.164
With the same type of sighting?

09:52.266 --> 09:53.332
Yes.

09:53.434 --> 09:54.666
Anything else?

09:54.768 --> 09:55.734
I had a dream one night.

09:55.836 --> 09:57.536
It was almost like the shadow people

09:57.638 --> 09:58.871
that we saw going down the hallway,

09:58.973 --> 10:02.007
but it was leaning over
me, scratching my forehead.

10:02.109 --> 10:03.275
And the next morning, I got up,

10:03.377 --> 10:07.079
and I had a scratch on my head.

10:07.181 --> 10:09.548
Now, couldn't you have
just scratched yourself?

10:09.650 --> 10:12.150
I don't believe so because
of the way, you know,

10:12.253 --> 10:13.585
when I looked in the mirror,

10:13.687 --> 10:19.791
it was exactly how, in my dream,
the shadow would have did it.

10:19.894 --> 10:25.297
In this room, I just see,
like, this younger girl.

10:25.399 --> 10:27.833
There's something off about her.

10:27.935 --> 10:33.138
Somebody's summoned her up from
her grave and, like, dug her up.

10:33.240 --> 10:37.609
And, like, she didn't come back right.

10:37.711 --> 10:39.878
I see her standing
at the end of the bed,

10:39.980 --> 10:41.547
and she's just staring.

10:41.649 --> 10:43.315
And it's really [bleep] creepy

10:43.417 --> 10:48.320
because standing behind
her is this dark thing

10:48.422 --> 10:51.290
that has attached itself to this kid.

10:51.392 --> 10:53.992
The thing ultimately
controls her and has, like,

10:54.094 --> 10:56.695
a connection to her.

10:56.797 --> 10:59.278
Do you have any idea what this
thing that's controlling her is?

10:59.333 --> 11:02.434
I would say it's some
kind of demonic force.

11:02.536 --> 11:05.004
Can you see it? What does it look like?

11:05.106 --> 11:08.256
This thing is very tall.

11:08.943 --> 11:11.043
Its hands are super
weird-looking...

11:11.145 --> 11:16.082
long, really super little
hands but long fingers.

11:16.184 --> 11:18.484
And do you have any idea
what it's trying to do?

11:18.586 --> 11:19.986
I think that it's trying

11:20.088 --> 11:22.521
to attach itself to
somebody in this room.

11:22.624 --> 11:26.425
What demons want... they
want to wreak havoc and chaos.

11:26.527 --> 11:28.895
Would you say that this
person is in danger?

11:28.997 --> 11:30.696
Yes, I would.

11:50.730 --> 11:53.831
So Sonya said she had a hell
of a time growing up here.

11:53.931 --> 11:58.667
I did not know that it marked
her for life like it has.

11:58.769 --> 12:01.503
Now, Sonya's at the point where
she won't even stay in the house.

12:01.605 --> 12:02.938
She's staying in the RV.

12:03.040 --> 12:05.340
Yeah. It broke my heart.

12:05.442 --> 12:08.610
She's got a bedroom in
there that's still her room.

12:08.712 --> 12:10.078
I mean, we still call it her room.

12:10.180 --> 12:12.781
It's still decorated, like, for her.

12:12.883 --> 12:14.449
Have you experienced anything?

12:14.552 --> 12:19.187
The very first night we
ever stayed in this house,

12:19.290 --> 12:22.591
I woke up with a girl
standing beside my bed,

12:22.693 --> 12:25.093
I mean, just, like, right here.

12:25.195 --> 12:26.929
Like, she's just
looking down at my face.

12:27.031 --> 12:28.564
Have you seen anything else like that?

12:28.666 --> 12:29.932
Just... every night,

12:30.034 --> 12:31.936
I see a shadow coming down the hallway.

12:32.036 --> 12:34.570
And it looks like it
goes out the front door.

12:34.672 --> 12:36.338
Your daughter explained
the same thing to me.

12:36.440 --> 12:38.574
And we both have seen
it at the same time.

12:38.676 --> 12:41.043
So, it's not been easy
here for you, either?

12:41.145 --> 12:42.278
No.

12:42.380 --> 12:43.946
It's that back hallway.

12:44.048 --> 12:46.949
If anything in this house
spooks me, it's the back hallway.

12:47.051 --> 12:49.351
And why does that spook you?

12:49.453 --> 12:51.553
Well, number one, that's
where I heard the voice.

12:51.656 --> 12:53.022
What voice?

12:53.124 --> 12:54.456
I was in the bathroom one day,

12:54.558 --> 13:02.584
and just this most evil, growly
voice was like, "Stop it."

13:03.200 --> 13:04.833
Just as low.

13:04.935 --> 13:09.634
And I was petrified that day.

13:13.244 --> 13:16.078
There's also another male here.

13:16.181 --> 13:18.609
And I see, like, an older male.

13:20.251 --> 13:21.951
He's a big problem.

13:22.053 --> 13:25.521
He yells a lot, very threatening.

13:25.623 --> 13:29.317
I do hear pounding on the walls,

13:30.428 --> 13:33.692
especially in, like, in this area.

13:34.032 --> 13:36.833
He's related to somebody
in the household.

13:36.935 --> 13:40.970
And he's somebody's grandfather
or great-grandfather.

13:41.072 --> 13:47.877
There's something in the
family that's really bad.

13:47.979 --> 13:50.393
Two people, at some point,
in this family, got married.

13:50.493 --> 13:54.929
They shouldn't have. It
was bad, very wrong and bad.

13:55.031 --> 13:59.033
And from that point
on, it's like this...

13:59.135 --> 14:04.639
this line, this family,
was cursed by their own.

14:04.741 --> 14:09.577
I don't think I've
ever... seen this before.

14:09.679 --> 14:12.113
I don't think he wants to show me

14:12.215 --> 14:13.714
who he's related to

14:13.816 --> 14:17.618
because that's the person
he's trying to destroy.

14:22.394 --> 14:23.881
So, Chad, I was talking to Sonya.

14:23.981 --> 14:25.198
Now, she told me about the experiences

14:25.298 --> 14:27.298
and how this house really
scarred her for life.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.200
Now, she had mentioned
you'd moved out of here

14:29.302 --> 14:30.735
pretty quick when you were young.

14:30.837 --> 14:32.579
Oh, as soon as I was 18, I was gone.

14:32.679 --> 14:33.569
Why, though?

14:33.669 --> 14:36.436
Most of it was because of the
things that had happened here.

14:36.538 --> 14:37.871
Okay. So tell me about some of them.

14:37.973 --> 14:41.274
One particular night, when I
was probably 8 or 9 years old,

14:41.376 --> 14:46.413
standing around my bed, I
counted six hooded figures.

14:46.515 --> 14:47.981
I had three on one side of my bed,

14:48.083 --> 14:49.816
three on the other side.

14:49.918 --> 14:51.585
So, you saw the same exact thing

14:51.687 --> 14:53.420
that Sonya was telling me about?

14:53.522 --> 14:54.721
Yeah.

14:54.823 --> 14:56.890
I'm 37 now, and I close my
eyes and I can still see them.

14:56.992 --> 14:59.125
- Okay. Anything else?
- Yeah.

14:59.227 --> 15:02.829
Around the same time that I seen that,

15:02.931 --> 15:06.800
I was laying in bed and woke up
to feeling pressure on my chest.

15:06.902 --> 15:09.235
And it felt like they
were underneath my bed

15:09.338 --> 15:12.806
and were pulling the
sheet tight down so...

15:12.908 --> 15:15.375
pinning me to my bed where
I could not move at all.

15:15.477 --> 15:16.710
I went to scream out,

15:16.812 --> 15:19.312
and I couldn't get
any words to come out.

15:19.414 --> 15:21.147
It took all the air out of my chest.

15:21.249 --> 15:25.218
I just told myself that I
shouldn't look underneath there.

15:25.320 --> 15:26.430
I may not like what I see.

15:31.026 --> 15:34.761
I see that the grandfather guy

15:34.863 --> 15:38.732
is attacking somebody in this room

15:38.834 --> 15:40.932
and is pushing down on their heart.

15:42.963 --> 15:45.730
It might feel more like their
throat or chest pressure,

15:45.833 --> 15:48.100
but he's actually inside their chest.

15:48.202 --> 15:52.404
He's trying to figure out
how to make the heart stop.

15:52.506 --> 15:55.507
He can't... grab it.

15:55.609 --> 15:59.189
He can put pressure on it,
but he can't squeeze it.

15:59.291 --> 16:01.082
And what is he trying to do?

16:01.184 --> 16:02.683
Kill them.

16:18.129 --> 16:19.877
First thing I do
when I get to a location

16:19.977 --> 16:21.177
is pull the property deed.

16:21.279 --> 16:23.045
Turns out one of the original owners

16:23.147 --> 16:25.514
was on the land for 65 years.

16:25.616 --> 16:27.583
I had a local historian check them out,

16:27.685 --> 16:29.885
and she just called back
saying these people have a story

16:29.987 --> 16:33.355
I'm definitely gonna want to know about.

16:40.644 --> 16:42.544
So, Glenda, what
were you able to find out

16:42.646 --> 16:44.724
about the original owners
of my client's property?

16:44.882 --> 16:47.917
Stephen Macgerlein came
from Germany to Owen County

16:48.019 --> 16:49.518
in the later 1830s.

16:49.620 --> 16:50.986
He married,

16:51.088 --> 16:54.523
and he and his wife had,
over the years, 12 children.

16:54.625 --> 16:55.925
Okay.

16:56.027 --> 17:00.296
They bought the property in
1864 and used it as a coal mine.

17:00.398 --> 17:02.565
Did he mine coal right
on my client's property?

17:02.667 --> 17:04.133
That's my understanding.

17:04.234 --> 17:05.434
Okay. That's interesting.

17:05.536 --> 17:06.836
You mentioned on the phone

17:06.938 --> 17:09.596
that this family had a story I'm
gonna want to hear for my case.

17:09.695 --> 17:10.729
What was that?

17:10.830 --> 17:13.198
Well, they had a number of deaths

17:13.300 --> 17:17.167
in the course of the time that
they lived in Patricksburg.

17:17.270 --> 17:22.007
In 1872, a 2-year-old son
died in an accident at the mill

17:22.108 --> 17:24.041
less than a 1/2 a mile down the road.

17:24.144 --> 17:25.710
- His name was Frederick.
- Okay.

17:25.811 --> 17:29.447
In 1888, his
13-year-old daughter,

17:29.549 --> 17:32.217
Hermione, died of typhoid fever.

17:32.319 --> 17:34.019
I'm afraid to even ask what else.

17:34.121 --> 17:37.188
In 1901, his
35-year-old daughter,

17:37.290 --> 17:39.557
Molly, died of consumption.

17:39.660 --> 17:42.093
The next year, in 1902,

17:42.195 --> 17:47.165
his wife died at the
age of 61 of peritonitis,

17:47.267 --> 17:50.101
intestinal problems, also.

17:50.203 --> 17:51.437
- Pretty tragic.
- Mm-hmm.

17:51.537 --> 17:53.003
So, what happened to him, Stephen?

17:53.106 --> 17:58.342
He died in 1915 at home of dropsy.

17:58.444 --> 18:00.211
- That's a heart condition.
- Okay.

18:00.313 --> 18:03.481
I brought you an obituary I
thought you'd like to see...

18:03.583 --> 18:05.177
"The Death of a Prominent Man."

18:06.086 --> 18:07.652
So he's 81 when he dies.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.187
- Mm-hmm.
- He died on the property.

18:09.289 --> 18:11.089
Yes. And, Glenda, let
me ask you a question.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.667
There's a couple cemeteries literally
right next door to the property.

18:13.767 --> 18:15.389
- Right.
- Is he buried there?

18:15.489 --> 18:17.289
- Yes.
- Okay.

18:17.391 --> 18:20.192
The whole family is
buried in that cemetery.

18:22.263 --> 18:26.932
Hmm.

18:29.040 --> 18:31.819
There's something about
two children that died.

18:33.553 --> 18:35.287
There's two children graves.

18:37.003 --> 18:39.850
I think one of them belongs to
the girl I saw in the bedroom.

18:39.950 --> 18:41.316
How old?

18:41.419 --> 18:45.020
Like 11 to 14 years of age, maybe.

18:45.122 --> 18:47.189
I'm not sure about the other one.

18:47.291 --> 18:50.859
I think it was a littler kid...

18:50.961 --> 18:54.830
which I think is a boy.

18:54.932 --> 18:58.267
The girl... I see
her with blond hair.

18:58.369 --> 19:02.375
And I feel like she was sick,
that she died from an illness.

19:02.740 --> 19:06.309
More than likely, she
died here, on this land,

19:06.411 --> 19:10.246
and that's what makes her close by.

19:10.348 --> 19:14.317
There's something weird
with her... her soul.

19:14.419 --> 19:16.990
And that's why she's out of her grave.

19:17.989 --> 19:18.926
Very strange.

19:20.591 --> 19:22.158
When Glenda
mentioned the Macgerleins

19:22.260 --> 19:23.547
operated a coal mine on the property,

19:23.647 --> 19:25.013
my ears perked up.

19:25.115 --> 19:28.240
Every time I've looked into one,
I found some terrible accident.

19:28.518 --> 19:31.303
I'm on my way back to the house
to meet a coal-mining expert

19:31.421 --> 19:32.553
who says two people

19:32.656 --> 19:34.822
died horrible deaths
right on Pam's property.

19:41.314 --> 19:42.713
I understand that there
was coal mining done

19:42.815 --> 19:43.981
right here on this property.

19:44.083 --> 19:45.983
That's correct. That was very common.

19:46.085 --> 19:47.484
People would have small mines

19:47.587 --> 19:49.987
that they would operate
on their own property.

19:50.089 --> 19:52.623
Do you have any idea where
they would have did the mining

19:52.725 --> 19:54.124
- on the property here?
- Right here.

19:54.226 --> 19:56.966
They opened this up,
dug down to the coal.

19:57.066 --> 19:59.466
And they just left it open,
and it filled up with rainwater.

19:59.568 --> 20:00.868
Oh. See, I...
Just looking at it,

20:00.970 --> 20:02.236
I would have never
known this was a mine.

20:02.338 --> 20:05.439
It totally changed the landscape
of this part of the country.

20:05.541 --> 20:07.908
I know it was a dangerous job.

20:08.010 --> 20:09.109
It was very hazardous,

20:09.211 --> 20:11.111
particularly the underground mines.

20:11.213 --> 20:14.181
We have a picture right here. Wow.

20:14.283 --> 20:16.283
These look like terrible
working conditions.

20:16.385 --> 20:18.152
There were numerous people killed

20:18.254 --> 20:20.387
and seriously injured
literally every day.

20:20.489 --> 20:23.390
You mentioned two people died on
the property here in the mines.

20:23.492 --> 20:26.360
What happened with that? The
first one happened in 1894.

20:26.462 --> 20:28.462
The victim's name was Aaron Wark,

20:28.564 --> 20:30.731
and he was taking a
break in the coal mine,

20:30.833 --> 20:33.167
and the roof caved in on him.

20:33.269 --> 20:35.936
He lingered for two
days from his injuries

20:36.038 --> 20:37.504
and then finally passed away.

20:37.606 --> 20:38.906
He was 32 years old,

20:39.008 --> 20:41.241
and he left a wife and
three small children.

20:41.344 --> 20:42.964
Okay. So, what was the second death?

20:43.032 --> 20:44.498
Ralph Wright.

20:44.600 --> 20:47.234
He was killed in 1934.

20:47.336 --> 20:48.769
He just got careless.

20:48.871 --> 20:52.839
He was pushing a cart
along and made a mistake

20:52.942 --> 20:56.944
and fell 90 feet down an open shaft,

20:57.046 --> 21:00.480
broke his neck, fractured
his skull, very tragic.

21:00.582 --> 21:02.349
I know what that looks
like. I've seen it.

21:02.451 --> 21:03.617
It's not a pretty sight.

21:07.123 --> 21:09.972
It's quite a big circle of land

21:10.072 --> 21:13.840
that surrounds this particular location,

21:13.942 --> 21:17.444
and it has something to do
with what's going on here.

21:17.546 --> 21:24.462
And it did seem like the
earth was bad for a long time,

21:24.562 --> 21:26.529
like things couldn't grow.

21:26.631 --> 21:30.511
It's like the earth literally
sucks the structures into it

21:30.635 --> 21:32.868
and somehow destroys them.

21:35.640 --> 21:38.207
And I really think that
there's this subtle poisoning

21:38.309 --> 21:39.975
going on.

21:40.077 --> 21:41.644
Nothing should be built here

21:41.746 --> 21:45.609
because they do eventually take it down.

21:51.556 --> 21:52.922
If you need us to investigate

21:53.024 --> 21:54.790
unexplained activity in your home,

21:54.892 --> 21:57.893

Click on "Help Me, Dead
Files!" to submit your story,

21:59.697 --> 22:00.663
and we'll help if we can.

22:08.176 --> 22:10.921
So far, I've got clients
being physically assaulted

22:11.021 --> 22:14.423
on a property that's seen more
than a half a dozen deaths.

22:14.525 --> 22:15.746
But I need to see if
there's anything else

22:15.846 --> 22:16.912
that could help my case.

22:18.301 --> 22:21.035
Searching through city
records, I find a crime

22:21.137 --> 22:23.458
involving a vigilante
group called the White Caps.

22:23.640 --> 22:25.506
Turns out, they nearly
beat a man to death

22:25.608 --> 22:28.924
right next to my client's property.

22:29.245 --> 22:31.579
I'm on my way to meet
with a local researcher

22:31.681 --> 22:34.415
who says this gang
terrorized the entire region.

22:41.888 --> 22:44.458
This article I came
across showed that a guy

22:44.561 --> 22:48.229
got beaten up on or right
near my client's property

22:48.331 --> 22:50.298
by a group of guys called White Cappers.

22:50.400 --> 22:52.500
I've never even heard of
them. What the hell is that?

22:52.602 --> 22:55.303
White Caps existed as secret societies

22:55.405 --> 23:01.809
in mainly Southern Indiana
in local, rural areas

23:01.911 --> 23:04.011
that passed out vigilante justice

23:04.113 --> 23:08.082
from around 1850
through the early 1900s.

23:08.184 --> 23:10.084
Were these guys like the KKK?

23:10.186 --> 23:13.788
They weren't racially motivated,
but there were similarities.

23:13.890 --> 23:16.090
The articles indicated
they wore robes...

23:16.192 --> 23:17.992
sometimes white, sometimes dark.

23:18.094 --> 23:18.993
Okay.

23:19.095 --> 23:20.728
But they felt that they had the right

23:20.830 --> 23:23.831
to enforce the moral
code of their community.

23:23.933 --> 23:25.637
What kind of people would they target?

23:25.669 --> 23:28.703
Drunks, adulterers, prostitutes,

23:28.805 --> 23:34.684
unwed mothers, petty thievery,
or not attending church.

23:36.713 --> 23:39.114
There are, like, a group of men,

23:39.216 --> 23:41.550
and they're all linked arm in arm.

23:41.652 --> 23:44.886
There is maybe 10 of them.

23:44.988 --> 23:51.059
These things are pretty
powerful, very aggressive.

23:54.152 --> 23:57.994
As far as them directly
interacting with the living,

23:58.094 --> 24:01.595
I think that they would feel a sense

24:01.697 --> 24:07.201
of absolutely being
watched and feeling stalked

24:07.303 --> 24:12.206
and feeling extreme fear,
like you're being hunted.

24:12.308 --> 24:15.476
And they want that to be their message.

24:17.380 --> 24:17.657
Okay.

24:17.718 --> 24:19.206
So now that I know
who White Cappers are,

24:19.306 --> 24:20.505
what do you know about the beating

24:20.608 --> 24:22.841
that this guy got near
my client's property?

24:22.943 --> 24:26.745
One evening...
February 14, 1890...

24:26.847 --> 24:30.716
there was a man by the
name of Fleming Bremmer

24:30.818 --> 24:34.853
who was coming home,
going through Patricksburg.

24:34.955 --> 24:38.123
A group of men in
dark robes grabbed him,

24:38.225 --> 24:41.293
took him through an
orchard, tied him to a tree,

24:41.395 --> 24:43.629
and pulled the branches off the trees

24:43.731 --> 24:46.265
and whipped him till
he was a bloody mess...

24:46.367 --> 24:49.034
- Okay...
- and left him there unconscious.

24:49.136 --> 24:50.902
And he didn't wake up till morning.

24:51.005 --> 24:52.437
Well, it's lucky this guy
didn't freeze to death,

24:52.539 --> 24:53.739
let alone from the beating.

24:53.841 --> 24:55.741
Do we know what the White
Cappers went after him?

24:55.843 --> 25:00.045
He had been warned that he
had been abusive to his mother.

25:00.147 --> 25:03.949
And so that was what
led to this incident.

25:04.051 --> 25:05.584
Okay. So, was anybody charged?

25:05.686 --> 25:06.752
No.

25:06.854 --> 25:08.086
Today, they would
never get away with it.

25:08.188 --> 25:11.657
In the hills of Southern
Indiana during the late 1800s...

25:11.759 --> 25:12.658
Right.

25:12.760 --> 25:14.826
There wasn't always the sheriffs

25:14.928 --> 25:18.279
and the police and the courts.

25:20.234 --> 25:22.501
I don't think they want anybody here.

25:22.603 --> 25:26.592
And there's also no denying
the feeling that they invoke,

25:26.692 --> 25:30.111
which is that you're being hunted.

25:32.798 --> 25:37.133
They've gone to where
this is a sport for them.

25:37.235 --> 25:40.063
This is, like, wicked bad.

25:47.381 --> 25:49.506
During my walk, I saw
several dead people,

25:49.606 --> 25:50.772
but two stood out the most.

25:51.796 --> 25:53.663
First, the cowboy.

25:53.765 --> 25:58.201
He was probably in his
mid-to late-30s, very thin.

25:58.303 --> 26:01.204
He had a black cowboy hat on,

26:01.306 --> 26:06.376
and he had a very thick mustache.

26:06.478 --> 26:07.377
Okay.

26:07.479 --> 26:08.778
Next, I described a demon

26:08.880 --> 26:12.148
who was using a dead little
girl to torment a living person.

26:12.250 --> 26:14.317
She was dressed like a doll.

26:14.419 --> 26:19.756
Behind her, which was
this tall, dark thing,

26:19.858 --> 26:22.125
and it had its hands on her shoulders

26:22.227 --> 26:25.528
and its fingers went like
halfway down her body.

26:25.630 --> 26:28.513
So it's, like, controlling her.

26:29.200 --> 26:30.667
Is this what you saw?

26:31.770 --> 26:34.037
Yes. That's what I saw.

26:53.171 --> 26:55.906
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

26:56.006 --> 26:57.539
we're ready to reveal our findings

26:57.641 --> 26:59.908
to each other and our
clients for the first time.

27:01.025 --> 27:02.410
Amy, I'd like you to meet Sonya.

27:03.715 --> 27:06.285
She grew up in the house right
across from the barn here,

27:06.385 --> 27:10.387
and she was tortured by
the activity growing up.

27:10.489 --> 27:11.721
Now, a few months ago,

27:11.824 --> 27:15.225
she was able to get out of a
very bad, abusive relationship

27:15.327 --> 27:17.894
and had to move back here
with one of her daughters.

27:17.996 --> 27:20.530
Now, here's how it's
working out for her.

27:20.632 --> 27:22.466
She's so afraid of the house

27:22.568 --> 27:26.636
that she's living in this
RV that's in the front lawn.

27:26.738 --> 27:28.271
So that's why we're
doing the reveal here

27:28.373 --> 27:30.607
'cause she doesn't want
to be in that house.

27:30.709 --> 27:33.176
This is Pam. This is Sonya's mom.

27:33.278 --> 27:35.278
And this is Chad, her brother.

27:35.380 --> 27:37.614
Here's where the twist comes in.

27:37.716 --> 27:40.817
Pam is getting ready
to retire and move out

27:40.919 --> 27:42.652
and wants to give the house to the kids,

27:42.754 --> 27:45.188
but they don't think it's safe.

27:45.290 --> 27:47.991
So with that, I'm gonna have
Amy tell us about her walk

27:48.093 --> 27:49.934
and how things went.

27:52.931 --> 27:56.333
When I first got
here, I saw a group of men.

27:56.435 --> 27:58.602
There were about 10 of them.

27:58.704 --> 28:02.672
And they roam around
the entire property.

28:02.774 --> 28:06.185
The living would experience
them in various ways.

28:06.278 --> 28:09.480
These guys make you feel
like you're being watched

28:09.582 --> 28:12.749
and, specifically, hunted.

28:12.852 --> 28:15.219
It's like that's what
I kept feeling like.

28:15.321 --> 28:18.388
I was being hunted like an animal.

28:18.491 --> 28:21.191
I felt like being watched real bad...

28:21.293 --> 28:23.127
Yeah... just, like, with pure hate,

28:23.229 --> 28:25.462
and just so bad that you had to move.

28:25.564 --> 28:28.031
You couldn't just stand
there. You had to go.

28:28.134 --> 28:30.601
I'll be sitting in the
living room, watching TV,

28:30.703 --> 28:35.339
and it's just like I
know they're watching me.

28:35.441 --> 28:39.209
The creepy thing about them is
that they do not want anybody

28:39.311 --> 28:41.311
on this land.

28:41.413 --> 28:41.891
All right. The only
thing I can think of...

28:41.991 --> 28:43.891
It's a long shot, but
there was something

28:43.993 --> 28:46.660
I came across in my research
that I thought was interesting.

28:47.463 --> 28:49.196
Apparently, back in the late 1800s,

28:49.298 --> 28:52.466
there was a gang of moral
vigilantes called White Cappers.

28:52.568 --> 28:55.436
Now, they performed
violence against anybody

28:55.538 --> 28:57.371
that they thought
were acting amorally...

28:57.473 --> 29:00.441
unwed mothers, hobos, drunks.

29:00.543 --> 29:02.309
They beat women. They beat men.

29:02.411 --> 29:03.611
Didn't matter who it was.

29:03.713 --> 29:05.613
They'd only attack at night,

29:05.715 --> 29:09.350
and when they would do attacks,
they'd wear robes and wear...

29:09.452 --> 29:12.019
Oh, no.

29:12.121 --> 29:13.120
Either white or black hoods.

29:13.222 --> 29:14.488
Oh.

29:14.590 --> 29:17.291
One of the victims was
beaten right on the property.

29:17.393 --> 29:18.392
Oh, my God.

29:18.494 --> 29:21.028
His name was Fleming Bremmer.

29:21.130 --> 29:24.231
He was a white male
who was 51 years old.

29:24.333 --> 29:26.967
Apparently, he was
abusive to his mother.

29:27.069 --> 29:30.404
Now, you guys had a big reaction
when I mentioned the robes.

29:30.506 --> 29:31.538
Tell Amy why.

29:31.641 --> 29:33.707
When I was probably
about 8 years old or so,

29:33.809 --> 29:36.243
and I had six...

29:36.345 --> 29:39.647
three up against the wall,
three on the side of the bed.

29:39.749 --> 29:42.516
They had no faces,
had their arms folded.

29:42.618 --> 29:43.617
I woke up the next morning

29:43.719 --> 29:45.252
and told my mom what had happened,

29:45.354 --> 29:47.054
and that's when she
sat me down that morning

29:47.156 --> 29:50.591
and told me that she had had
that same thing happen to her.

29:50.693 --> 29:52.059
I woke up in the middle of the night,

29:52.161 --> 29:55.062
and there was four hooded
figures around my bed.

29:55.164 --> 29:58.432
And I screamed until
Mom got up and came in.

29:58.534 --> 30:01.138
Okay. Well, that makes a lot of sense.

30:02.739 --> 30:04.405
What else did you see?

30:04.507 --> 30:05.806
When I walked into the house,

30:05.909 --> 30:11.078
I came across a couple of
dead people that concerned me.

30:11.181 --> 30:13.047
One of them is an older male.

30:13.149 --> 30:15.082
He's extremely active in the house,

30:15.185 --> 30:17.818
and he's a big problem here.

30:17.921 --> 30:20.922
He affects the living in a lot of ways.

30:21.024 --> 30:22.390
He does yell a lot,

30:22.492 --> 30:26.494
so people might hear a voice,
humming, or buzzing sound.

30:26.596 --> 30:28.696
He pounds on the walls.

30:28.798 --> 30:29.997
I got very concerned, though,

30:30.099 --> 30:33.167
when I walked into the
first bedroom down the hall.

30:33.269 --> 30:34.936
That's Chad's room.

30:35.038 --> 30:38.673
His sights were set on
whoever was in there.

30:38.775 --> 30:40.875
I saw him on the bed,
sitting over this person,

30:40.977 --> 30:43.732
literally reaching into their chest,

30:44.237 --> 30:46.771
touching their heart and
trying to squeeze the heart,

30:46.873 --> 30:48.973
trying to give the
person a heart attack.

30:49.075 --> 30:50.941
That would be me.

30:52.152 --> 30:54.753
I felt like someone
was underneath my bed,

30:54.855 --> 30:57.122
pulling the sheet
down tight around me...

30:57.224 --> 31:00.225
Mm-hmm... compressing my chest

31:00.327 --> 31:02.261
to the point where I
I could not move.

31:02.363 --> 31:04.263
I couldn't breathe.

31:04.365 --> 31:06.732
I think there's a family connection

31:06.834 --> 31:08.233
between him and the living here.

31:08.335 --> 31:09.735
I got that he was somebody's grandfather

31:09.837 --> 31:11.670
or great-grandfather.

31:11.772 --> 31:14.773
Somewhere, a very long time ago,

31:14.875 --> 31:17.142
there was a marriage that
occurred in the family

31:17.244 --> 31:19.745
that was not deemed appropriate.

31:19.847 --> 31:22.714
And ever since that marriage took place,

31:22.816 --> 31:25.250
there's, like, a family curse.

31:25.352 --> 31:28.654
Whoever shows the dominant
traits of the individual

31:28.756 --> 31:31.890
that was deemed inappropriate
for the marriage,

31:31.992 --> 31:33.443
they are the ones who are targeted.

31:34.821 --> 31:35.987
I wouldn't be surprised,

31:36.089 --> 31:39.190
if you take a look back
at your mother's line,

31:39.292 --> 31:43.061
and see how they met
their demise, some of them.

31:43.163 --> 31:46.864
There might be some
unusual issues there.

31:46.966 --> 31:48.733
- There are.
- Yes.

31:48.835 --> 31:49.767
- There are.
- There are.

31:49.869 --> 31:52.770
You're gonna have to tell them.

31:52.872 --> 31:54.339
Wow.

31:54.441 --> 31:58.576
I mean, my mom was very promiscuous.

31:58.678 --> 32:00.678
She was married seven times.

32:00.780 --> 32:02.880
She was shot.

32:02.982 --> 32:04.315
She was with a guy

32:04.417 --> 32:09.721
that got his head blown off
by her soon-to-be ex-husband.

32:09.823 --> 32:14.144
I mean, we were raised going
to maybe five different schools

32:14.244 --> 32:15.544
- in a year...
- Oh, my goodness.

32:15.646 --> 32:18.647
Watching her being beat all the time.

32:18.749 --> 32:20.015
And I worry about her

32:20.117 --> 32:25.187
because she... takes after
her in a lot of those ways.

32:25.289 --> 32:28.423
Interesting.

32:28.525 --> 32:31.526
Now, Amy, you mentioned unusual
deaths within the family.

32:31.628 --> 32:35.897
This is Pam's brother Jeff,

32:35.999 --> 32:39.795
who passed away a few years
ago by committing suicide.

32:40.037 --> 32:42.704
He spent a lot of time here,
too, as a matter of fact.

32:42.807 --> 32:44.907
We were more like brothers.

32:45.009 --> 32:47.543
It was definitely over a woman.

32:47.645 --> 32:50.712
I don't know much about curses,
but it's a doozy of a curse.

32:50.815 --> 32:51.820
Yes.

32:54.084 --> 32:59.584
So then I met another dead
guy, and he's very active here.

33:00.592 --> 33:03.186
One of the things that
he does to get attention

33:03.288 --> 33:04.787
is he does, like,

33:04.890 --> 33:09.025
show himself as a, like, a
five-foot-tall shadow person.

33:09.127 --> 33:10.827
But he's about 5'10 ", 5'11".

33:10.929 --> 33:13.263
He can go all over
the property...

33:13.365 --> 33:14.364
inside, outside, everywhere.

33:14.466 --> 33:15.632
He likes the living room,

33:15.734 --> 33:18.401
and he likes the back bedroom the best.

33:18.503 --> 33:21.067
He wants a lot of attention,
so he does act out.

33:22.841 --> 33:24.541
He's dressed all in black.

33:24.643 --> 33:26.877
I got a very cowboy vibe from him.

33:26.979 --> 33:28.778
I thought he was in his 30s.

33:28.881 --> 33:30.847
I saw him holding a gun.

33:30.949 --> 33:35.752
I...would say that would be Raymond.

33:35.854 --> 33:37.621
We're talking about Sonya's ex-husband,

33:37.723 --> 33:40.190
who also committed suicide.

33:52.594 --> 33:53.904
You okay, honey?

33:54.006 --> 33:56.439
Mm-hmm. I don't know.

33:56.541 --> 33:58.635
I guess I just didn't really
figure him to stick around here.

33:59.812 --> 34:01.645
Well, I did have a sketch done,

34:01.747 --> 34:04.148
so you can tell me what you think.

34:09.722 --> 34:12.723
Oh, yeah. Are you kidding me?

34:13.958 --> 34:15.192
I think it looks a lot like him.

34:15.293 --> 34:16.994
- I think it could be.
- I really do.

34:17.096 --> 34:20.597
The Adam's apple is so prominent.

34:20.699 --> 34:22.399
So, what do you think?

34:22.501 --> 34:24.034
After hearing what
they're saying about him...

34:24.136 --> 34:26.469
Yeah. I think it's him.

34:26.572 --> 34:28.371
Why would he stay here?

34:28.474 --> 34:30.340
Why would he not go where I go?

34:30.443 --> 34:32.876
There's something about your mother

34:32.978 --> 34:39.183
that he's attached to,
and he feels comfortable.

34:39.284 --> 34:40.331
You've been through hell, kid.

34:42.255 --> 34:44.288
Yeah. I was young.

34:44.389 --> 34:45.790
Got a lot of guilt with both of them.

34:51.230 --> 34:57.868
This is where, to me,
things got really weird.

34:57.970 --> 35:00.838
Uh-oh. The little girl...

35:04.395 --> 35:06.028
This girl looked really sweet,

35:06.130 --> 35:08.998
and to me, she was just pure innocence.

35:09.100 --> 35:11.000
I can tell that you
like the little girl,

35:11.102 --> 35:14.076
and this is not gonna be good news.

35:14.176 --> 35:17.544
I saw two graves of children.

35:17.646 --> 35:20.380
One was a female,

35:20.482 --> 35:23.383
like 9 to 12 or something in there.

35:23.485 --> 35:25.385
The other was a little boy.

35:25.487 --> 35:29.456
I do believe that the girl got
sick and died from an illness.

35:29.558 --> 35:33.393
And I believe she died
somewhere on this land.

35:33.495 --> 35:37.664
And I would place the young
girl in, like, the 1900s,

35:37.766 --> 35:39.933
by her little outfit.

35:40.035 --> 35:44.371
There are two kids that
you described who did live

35:44.473 --> 35:46.239
and died right on the property.

35:46.341 --> 35:48.775
The land was owned by a guy
named Stephen Macgerlein.

35:48.877 --> 35:51.945
He lived here from 1864 to 1915.

35:52.047 --> 35:55.715
In 1872, his 2-year-old
son, Frederick,

35:55.817 --> 35:59.786
died in a horrible accident
in the family's gristmill.

35:59.888 --> 36:03.523
Now, in 1888, Macgerlein's
daughter Hermione

36:03.625 --> 36:06.459
died from typhoid fever.

36:06.561 --> 36:08.295
Now, the kicker is, both
those kids are buried

36:08.397 --> 36:10.730
in one of the cemeteries
right next door to you.

36:10.832 --> 36:12.299
Oh, wow.

36:12.401 --> 36:14.000
So, what's the little girl do here?

36:14.102 --> 36:16.836
She was in the middle bedroom.

36:16.938 --> 36:18.405
That's your old room.

36:18.507 --> 36:19.639
Yes.

36:19.741 --> 36:21.274
She was standing at the edge of the bed

36:21.376 --> 36:23.810
and just staring straight
ahead at the person in the bed.

36:23.912 --> 36:26.513
It was very creepy.

36:26.615 --> 36:30.928
I realized that the dead
girl was pretty much gone.

36:31.586 --> 36:32.819
And behind her,

36:32.921 --> 36:35.822
I see this dark thing
standing and controlling her.

36:35.924 --> 36:40.539
He was very tall and creepy
and had extremely long fingers.

36:43.933 --> 36:46.674
Now, I've seen a creature,
is what I described it as...

36:46.774 --> 36:51.117
four feet tall, humanoid
with long, white hair.

36:51.217 --> 36:56.019
But it had fingers that
were probably this long.

36:56.121 --> 36:59.890
So I had a sketch done of
what I saw in the bedroom.

37:16.208 --> 37:18.442
That's it.

37:18.544 --> 37:20.510
Oh, my God.

37:32.984 --> 37:36.720
So I had a sketch done
of what I saw in the bedroom.

37:47.685 --> 37:48.718
That's it.

37:48.820 --> 37:51.187
Oh, my God.

38:01.065 --> 38:03.533
Do you think they were
gonna cause me harm?

38:06.070 --> 38:11.607
There is a demon or
a demonic presence...

38:13.077 --> 38:16.145
that is utilizing a deceased girl.

38:16.247 --> 38:20.883
The intention there is
to possess the individual

38:20.985 --> 38:22.151
that was in this bed.

38:24.565 --> 38:25.037
All right.

38:25.137 --> 38:27.204
So, are you saying that
this thing that you had drawn

38:27.306 --> 38:29.975
is a demon and is
trying to get to Sonya?

38:30.075 --> 38:31.575
Yes.

38:31.677 --> 38:35.412
And it's also projecting those
hooded figures you've all seen.

38:35.514 --> 38:36.847
That's what I thought.

38:36.949 --> 38:41.852
That's how I felt because
it was such hate and malice

38:41.954 --> 38:44.021
that you felt.

38:44.123 --> 38:47.057
And I always wondered
in the back of my mind

38:47.159 --> 38:48.358
if it was demonic.

38:48.460 --> 38:52.763
When I was a child, I
had a dream of, like,

38:52.865 --> 38:56.633
these nails over me and being
scratched on my forehead.

38:56.735 --> 38:58.302
And as I... when I
woke up that morning,

38:58.404 --> 39:00.351
there was that scratch on my forehead.

39:02.141 --> 39:07.845
I really think that this goes
back to this initial curse.

39:07.947 --> 39:10.314
Whoever placed this curse

39:10.416 --> 39:14.285
was very well-versed in how to do it...

39:16.622 --> 39:19.924
And brought in this
kind of demonic presence.

39:20.026 --> 39:24.628
I think that it's through your line.

39:25.940 --> 39:32.240
Never in my wildest imagination
did I think there was this much.

39:34.488 --> 39:37.212
So now, Sonya, after hearing
what Amy has told us tonight,

39:37.312 --> 39:38.411
it's pretty clear

39:38.513 --> 39:40.489
you haven't had a day of
peace in your entire life.

39:40.649 --> 39:42.582
I'm really hoping tonight's
a turning point for you,

39:42.684 --> 39:44.584
as well as everybody else at the table.

39:44.686 --> 39:47.020
And it starts by answering
one big question...

39:47.122 --> 39:49.589
Can you kick out whatever
the hell's in the house

39:49.691 --> 39:51.825
so that you and your
daughter can move in

39:51.927 --> 39:53.860
and start your lives over, basically?

39:53.962 --> 39:56.129
So for that answer, I'm
gonna turn it over to Amy.

40:01.803 --> 40:04.170
There is a lot that needs to be done,

40:04.272 --> 40:08.074
and the first thing is
to find a group of shamen

40:08.176 --> 40:11.143
because there is some
type of demonic force

40:11.246 --> 40:14.547
that's been following the
family as part of this curse.

40:14.649 --> 40:17.950
What they will do is a curse unraveling,

40:18.052 --> 40:22.188
a cord cutting, a removal
of all the negative energies,

40:22.290 --> 40:23.990
and then they will also do protections

40:24.092 --> 40:27.760
to lock down the land and the house.

40:27.862 --> 40:29.395
What the cord cutting will do

40:29.497 --> 40:33.132
is it will remove any and
all invisible attachments

40:33.234 --> 40:37.270
that you've made to any
dead people or entities.

40:37.372 --> 40:42.996
So once all of that's done,
then Raymond must be moved on.

40:43.096 --> 40:49.900
I would like an older female,
gentle medium go into your room

40:50.003 --> 40:54.425
and have a session with
him and help him to move on.

40:56.709 --> 40:58.809
It's just hard to...

40:58.911 --> 41:00.578
I mean, I want him to move on.

41:00.680 --> 41:02.079
And I always...

41:02.181 --> 41:03.414
I guess I always was hoping

41:03.516 --> 41:05.683
that he was watching over his daughter

41:05.785 --> 41:07.659
and not stuck here.

41:09.489 --> 41:11.822
Oh, it's just
That's hard.

41:11.924 --> 41:13.124
Well, now you have a chance.

41:13.226 --> 41:17.328
You know exactly where he is,
and you can help him to go.

41:17.430 --> 41:20.231
So, Sonya, you're gonna
listen to Amy's advice on this?

41:20.333 --> 41:21.799
- Definitely.
- Mom?

41:21.901 --> 41:23.200
Oh, absolutely.

41:23.302 --> 41:25.202
I think we can put them
on their heels pretty

41:25.304 --> 41:27.271
- pretty quick.
- So once this gets done,

41:27.373 --> 41:29.407
you think you're gonna move
up here with your daughter?

41:29.509 --> 41:30.741
I wouldn't mind it.

41:30.843 --> 41:32.076
I just don't want Cassie to go through

41:32.178 --> 41:33.411
the same thing I went
through as a child.

41:34.777 --> 41:36.944
Removing the demon needs
to happen immediately for Sonya

41:37.046 --> 41:39.255
and her family to protect their souls.

41:39.355 --> 41:42.944
In doing so, they'll free
the dead and break the curse

41:43.044 --> 41:45.278
that's been plaguing their
family for generations.
