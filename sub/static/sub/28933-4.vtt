sealed documents?

00:17.234 --> 00:19.106
That's why they're sealed.That's why I have friends.

00:19.149 --> 00:21.673
JULIAN: Don't tell me.
You need intel and the NYPD

00:21.717 --> 00:22.892
is slowing you down.

00:22.935 --> 00:24.415
Just in case.If I were to call,

00:24.459 --> 00:26.156
what would I call you?Julian.

you and Andy as their dads.

Yes, I can verify that
Samantha Amrimitsu
works here.

00:53.183 --> 00:57.100
It seems Sam is leaving
because she is pregnant,

00:57.144 --> 01:00.234
and placing her baby
for adoption.

posture tonight.

08:21.196 --> 08:23.154

08:23.198 --> 08:25.026
Technically, you area primate.

08:25.069 --> 08:27.681
No, I'm noticing a more

who was promoted
to detective second grade.

08:33.077 --> 08:36.254
I'd hug you
if you weren't so averse to PDA.

too public, or too affectionate.

08:53.620 --> 08:55.926

and eat money?

08:55.970 --> 08:57.667
People tend
to lower their inhibitions

08:57.711 --> 08:58.886
at over-the-top parties,

08:58.929 --> 09:00.844
which is probably why
you don't like them.

09:00.888 --> 09:02.672
But I've been to some fun ones.

Yeah, I'm thrilled for you and
your globetrotting blowouts,

09:09.113 --> 09:10.593
but these are kids.

09:10.637 --> 09:12.508
These are not kids. They're
wolverines in glitter makeup.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.292
Still, it's nice to make up

09:14.336 --> 09:17.165
for the parties I wasn't
invited to when I was a kid,

09:17.208 --> 09:19.646
which was approximately
all of them.

09:19.689 --> 09:21.648
The vic is Ella Baynes, 37,

09:21.691 --> 09:24.825
wife and stepmother hosting
this modest little shindig.

09:24.868 --> 09:27.610
She fell just as the birthday
girl was about to be announced.

09:32.180 --> 09:34.356
Broken neck.HARRIS:
Yeah. Very likely.

09:34.399 --> 09:37.315
Facial trauma.
She hit hard.

09:39.361 --> 09:42.320
I doubt we'll get
anything off that.

09:44.279 --> 09:46.324
She fell from up there?HARRIS: Yeah.

09:47.674 --> 09:52.113
Anyone up here wearing high
heels is risking their life.

09:52.156 --> 09:53.549
Can't rule out
an accidental fall.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.421
Yes, but the timing of it,
the theatricality,

09:56.465 --> 09:58.336
suggests Ella's ending was...
premeditated.

Will you take him, please?Oh, my God, it's Lord and Taylor
of the Flies.

10:08.172 --> 10:11.567
This way. Put that away.What's up with this guy?

10:11.611 --> 10:13.656
HARRIS:
Name's Boyd Carter,
cater-waiter.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.266
Arrested for assault
two years ago.

10:15.310 --> 10:16.572
Our victim fired him

10:16.616 --> 10:18.226
shortly before her fatal fall.

10:18.269 --> 10:19.662
Well, if this wasn't
an accident,

10:19.706 --> 10:21.185
we have our first suspect.

10:21.229 --> 10:24.362
Well, according to our
mob of 16-year-olds,

10:24.406 --> 10:27.017
he's not just a suspect.

10:27.061 --> 10:29.672
He's the murderer.

10:30.717 --> 10:32.022
Who posted this?

10:33.415 --> 10:35.504
The question may be,
who didn't?

10:40.422 --> 10:42.511
♪

10:51.651 --> 10:53.348
KIM: They were about to
announce Alex,

10:53.391 --> 10:55.829
you know, for her
grand stage entrance.

10:55.872 --> 10:57.613
We heard the commotion
and the splash.

10:57.657 --> 11:01.051
And the next thing we knew,
she was facedown in fish.

11:01.095 --> 11:02.574
Thank you, Kim.

11:02.618 --> 11:04.011
I couldn't help
but notice earlier

11:04.054 --> 11:06.013
that you keep your distance
from the others.

11:06.056 --> 11:08.842
Thanks for noticing.Is there
a reason for that?

11:10.191 --> 11:12.280
How long have you known
the birthday girl? Alex.

11:12.323 --> 11:13.716
Since our moms met
in Mommy & Me.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.239
Childhood chums.I guess.

11:15.283 --> 11:18.982
More so before the divorce
left Alex with a new stepmom,

11:19.026 --> 11:20.375
Ella.

11:20.418 --> 11:21.942
Alex didn't take it real well.

11:21.985 --> 11:23.813
Kind of turned her into a bitch.

11:23.857 --> 11:25.772
I-I mean,
it's a cliché,

11:25.815 --> 11:28.122
but Step-Ella
could be kind of evil.

11:28.165 --> 11:30.907
And that's not displacement--
she really was.

11:30.951 --> 11:33.214
Doesn't mean
we wanted her to die.

11:33.257 --> 11:35.825
Understood.

11:35.869 --> 11:37.566
I like you.SHAYLA: Hey.

11:37.609 --> 11:38.872
You want to know
what happened?

11:38.915 --> 11:40.177
That murderer was
all lech-y with us,

11:40.221 --> 11:41.701
so Step-Ella canned him

11:41.744 --> 11:43.615
to make Alex like her.EVIE:
Details are sketchy,

11:43.659 --> 11:45.182
but from what I'm hearing,
Boyd Carter,

11:45.226 --> 11:46.227
a high school-dropout waiter,

11:46.270 --> 11:48.055
has been taken into custody.

11:48.098 --> 11:51.232
We have here a gentleman who,
I think, works with the NYPD.

11:51.275 --> 11:53.321
Although considering
his dapper attire,

11:53.364 --> 11:54.322
I may be wrong.

11:54.365 --> 11:55.758
Sir, uh,
if we could get

11:55.802 --> 11:57.412
a few words?This is a crime scene,
little lady.

11:57.455 --> 11:58.630
How about a little respect?

11:58.674 --> 12:00.589
Sir, did you just
call her "little lady"?

12:00.632 --> 12:02.199
Give me those.Hey, you can't do that!

12:02.243 --> 12:04.245
Oh, quit whining.
It's a phone, not your kidneys.

12:04.288 --> 12:05.246
You'll survive.Actually,

12:05.289 --> 12:07.204
Evie's right--
you can't.

12:07.248 --> 12:09.467
It's in violation of
the Constitution under
the Rileydecision.

12:09.511 --> 12:10.599
What are you, pre-law?

12:10.642 --> 12:12.253
Kim? She's AP English
and AP History.

12:12.296 --> 12:13.515
JUSTIN:
AP Chem.

12:16.823 --> 12:18.172
This is insane.

12:18.215 --> 12:20.478
You know, I'm basically
a victim here, too.Oh.

12:20.522 --> 12:22.611
Yeah? How do you figure?Look around.

12:22.654 --> 12:24.526
It's all over social media
that I'm a killer.

12:24.569 --> 12:25.701
My parents are trying
to raise bail money,

12:25.745 --> 12:27.050
and I'm not even under arrest.

12:27.094 --> 12:29.183
Why didn't you leave
after the victim fired you?

12:29.226 --> 12:30.706
Those girls wouldn't let me.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.273
Isn't there a law against
smearing people on the Internet?

12:32.316 --> 12:34.449
Libel? Or-or slander?

12:34.492 --> 12:36.407
You should arrest them.OFFICER: Let's go.

12:37.452 --> 12:39.584
Please tell me
you found someone

12:39.628 --> 12:41.282
who caught it on their phone.Not quite.

12:41.325 --> 12:43.632
Lots of cheering,
lots of screaming, no perp.

12:43.675 --> 12:46.026
You get anything from the
sweet 16 peanut gallery?

12:46.069 --> 12:47.375
Yes.

12:47.418 --> 12:49.856
I am very worried
about the future of mankind.

12:49.899 --> 12:51.466
This constant urge

12:51.509 --> 12:53.163
to record and
share everything

12:53.207 --> 12:55.339
negatively affects
our brain activity.Anything about our case?

12:55.383 --> 12:58.212
These kids are cut off
from the very experiences

12:58.255 --> 12:59.909
they're trying
to capture.

12:59.953 --> 13:01.650
So, anything
about our case?I'll put a call in

13:01.693 --> 13:03.217
to the judge
to check their social media,

13:03.260 --> 13:04.740
and I'll keep a tight leash
on the cater-waiter.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.437
Reinhart and I
will go back inside

13:06.481 --> 13:08.178
and talk to the vic's
husband and stepdaughter.

13:08.222 --> 13:10.528
If you're done.I'm done.

13:10.572 --> 13:11.921
But "social" and "media"

13:11.965 --> 13:14.315
are two words
that do not belong together.

13:16.143 --> 13:17.753
Okay, I'm done.

13:19.581 --> 13:21.583
JASMINE:
So...

13:21.626 --> 13:22.889
Jules...

13:22.932 --> 13:24.760
is this your first
police station assignment

13:24.804 --> 13:26.414
as a computer guy?

13:26.457 --> 13:29.373
Yes, it is. Corporate offices
are more my bag, so to speak.

13:29.417 --> 13:32.333
Must take some time getting used
to dealing with cops all day.

13:32.376 --> 13:34.683
Well, I did watch
the Police Academymovies

13:34.726 --> 13:37.120
when I was a child,
so I had some idea.

13:39.601 --> 13:41.733
Are you single?

13:41.777 --> 13:43.997
Me? Uh, no, not exactly.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.868
Oh, too bad.

13:46.869 --> 13:49.089
Oh. No. Not for me.
I just...

13:49.132 --> 13:51.526
I thought I saw
some sparks between...

13:51.569 --> 13:52.832
you and Lizzie.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.790
Detective Needham?

13:54.834 --> 13:56.748
She's out of my league.

13:56.792 --> 13:58.881
I wouldn't be so sure.

13:58.925 --> 14:00.927
You should come to her party.

14:00.970 --> 14:03.320
Thanks for the invitation.

14:09.718 --> 14:11.720
She brought out
the best in me.

14:11.763 --> 14:13.287
In everyone.

14:13.330 --> 14:16.072
Ella gave up her work so that
she could be present for Alex,

14:16.116 --> 14:17.857
so that we
could build a family.

14:17.900 --> 14:19.293
What the hell happened?

14:19.336 --> 14:20.729
Can somebody tell me?

14:20.772 --> 14:23.688
We're working on that,
Mr. Gerich, I promise you.

14:23.732 --> 14:25.690
To do that, we're gonna need
more information from you.

14:25.734 --> 14:27.779
Your first wife,
was she here tonight?

14:27.823 --> 14:29.694
What does that matter?

14:29.738 --> 14:32.610
My mom came and gave me
some makeup and a hug,
and then she was out the door,

14:32.654 --> 14:34.395
because she couldn't
stomach being here.

14:34.438 --> 14:36.788
Alexandra, not the time,
not the place.

14:36.832 --> 14:38.703
I'm sorry.We're all upset

14:38.747 --> 14:39.748
right now.

14:39.791 --> 14:41.228
The divorce,

14:41.271 --> 14:43.143
a new marriage,
Ella moving in.

14:43.186 --> 14:45.536
It's all been
really hard on Alex.

14:45.580 --> 14:47.843
And now this.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.672
Is there anyone else
Ella was close with
that we could talk to?

14:50.715 --> 14:52.065
[Alex sniffles]

14:52.108 --> 14:54.937
Uh, she had a friend
here tonight, Molly.

14:54.981 --> 14:57.461
It's hit her really hard.

14:58.506 --> 15:00.856
We were friends.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.815
For a long time.

15:03.859 --> 15:07.080
Just when she was
finally living the fairy tale.

15:07.123 --> 15:08.516
LIZZIE:
It's okay.

15:08.559 --> 15:11.867
Take your time.
How did you two meet?

15:11.911 --> 15:14.609
Uh, at culinary arts school.

15:14.652 --> 15:15.958
We were assigned
to be partners

15:16.002 --> 15:18.656
and became
close friends.

15:18.700 --> 15:19.919
Ella was a nurturer.

15:19.962 --> 15:21.442
She had a gift.

15:22.704 --> 15:25.402
That girl could take
any ingredients

15:25.446 --> 15:27.709
and create something delicious.

15:27.752 --> 15:29.711
I couldn't form a
plan without her.

15:29.754 --> 15:31.191
Hiring an old friend, then,

15:31.234 --> 15:33.497
to work this party
was a no-brainer.

15:33.541 --> 15:34.890
Yeah. We counted on each other.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.892
I'm not sure what I'm
gonna do without her.

15:36.936 --> 15:37.980
Detective Needham.

15:38.024 --> 15:39.025
Excuse me.

15:43.464 --> 15:45.422
Dead fish.

15:45.466 --> 15:47.903
These were once
perfectly happy koi fish,

15:47.947 --> 15:50.471
doing their best to adapt
to their not-so-natural habitat.

15:50.514 --> 15:52.995
You're wondering
if these fish died

15:53.039 --> 15:55.911
because something on Ella's
body was introduced to them

15:55.955 --> 15:58.696
in their not-so-
natural habitat.Mm-hmm.

15:58.740 --> 15:59.915
A contaminate?Toxin?

15:59.959 --> 16:01.395
A toxin originating from Ella.

16:01.438 --> 16:03.136
Yes, leaching
into the water

16:03.179 --> 16:05.268
and killing these
now not-so-happy fish.

16:05.312 --> 16:08.706
I'll get CSU back here,
get some water samples.

16:08.750 --> 16:10.012
And don't let them forget
those guys.

16:10.056 --> 16:11.883
We can't assume they're...
red herrings.

16:11.927 --> 16:13.233
Really?

16:13.276 --> 16:15.496
Not to pat myself
on the back,Oh, God forbid.

16:15.539 --> 16:17.454
but if we are looking
for poison,

16:17.498 --> 16:20.109
it may confirm my theory
of a premeditated plan.

16:20.153 --> 16:21.763
If she was carrying a toxin,

16:21.806 --> 16:24.592
she may have been dead or dying
before she even hit the water.

16:31.773 --> 16:33.905
Ella moved to New York from
Erie. Middle-class upbringing.

16:33.949 --> 16:35.864
Parents deceased,
and a sister who lives in Tampa.

16:35.907 --> 16:38.823
This was her first marriage,
and from everything I read,

16:38.867 --> 16:40.303
she seemed like
a really nice person.

16:40.347 --> 16:42.218
Am I boring you?

16:42.262 --> 16:44.046
I just can't understand
why Sam hasn't called.

16:44.090 --> 16:45.874
Andy doesn't think we
should call her, but I
think we should call her.

16:45.917 --> 16:47.702
What do you think?
I'm not gonna call.

16:47.745 --> 16:49.704
You really want to
know what I think?

16:49.747 --> 16:50.748
Don't answer that.

16:50.792 --> 16:52.315
C.O.D. is cervical fracture.

16:52.359 --> 16:54.013
That's a broken neck.

16:54.056 --> 16:57.407
Thanks. We think something else
may also have played a factor.

16:57.451 --> 16:59.540
Of course you do.What about her face?

16:59.583 --> 17:02.543
Looks like more than
just trauma from the fall.

17:02.586 --> 17:04.632
Skin irritation
is not the C.O.D.

17:04.675 --> 17:08.505
Can you imagine a world
in which anything other than
a broken neck could be a factor?

17:08.549 --> 17:11.813
Doug, her face swelled,
like she had a reaction
to something.

17:11.856 --> 17:13.684
There was a waiter

17:13.728 --> 17:15.251
with a record
in attendance.

17:15.295 --> 17:17.123
Maybe he slipped something
into her food or drink

17:17.166 --> 17:18.515
after she fired him?

17:18.559 --> 17:21.083
Revenge can serve to restore
a psychological balance

17:21.127 --> 17:22.693
that had been disturbed.

17:22.737 --> 17:24.565
Okay, Freud,
can we put a hold

17:24.608 --> 17:27.655
on human behavior and stick
to hard science, please?

17:27.698 --> 17:29.091
General tox screen
came back negative.

17:29.135 --> 17:30.092
There's no toxins

17:30.136 --> 17:31.833
in her stomach
or esophagus.

17:31.876 --> 17:33.443
So it wasn't ingested.

17:33.487 --> 17:35.489
Injected?No needle marks.

17:36.490 --> 17:38.013
I checked.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.406
LIZZIE:
Which means the toxin

17:39.449 --> 17:41.495
could have been inhaled
or absorbed through the skin

17:41.538 --> 17:42.931
with a topical...
Maybe her makeup

17:42.974 --> 17:44.672
was laced with something.

17:44.715 --> 17:46.587
I can't run a specific
tox screen till I know

17:46.630 --> 17:48.241
what I'm
looking for, so...

17:48.284 --> 17:49.764
sleuth some more.

17:52.158 --> 17:54.725
Our sweet 16 got her makeup
from her mom

17:54.769 --> 17:57.250
right before she
took off, early.

17:57.293 --> 18:00.470
And then her ex-husband's new,
younger wife died.

18:00.514 --> 18:02.559
Always put your money
on the jealous ex.

18:02.603 --> 18:04.170
Hard science?

18:05.780 --> 18:07.956
Alex says you
didn't stay very long

18:07.999 --> 18:10.915
after she opened her gift.I...

18:10.959 --> 18:13.353
felt far too uncomfortable.

18:13.396 --> 18:15.659
It's another planet over there.

18:15.703 --> 18:17.966
Over-the-top, tacky, ridiculous.

18:18.009 --> 18:19.968
I want no
part of that.

18:20.011 --> 18:23.363
And I don't want Alex to,
either. Wrong values.

18:23.406 --> 18:26.583
Steve and I share
joint custody, so...

18:26.627 --> 18:28.063
DYLAN:
You don't seem

18:28.107 --> 18:30.413
all that broken up
by any of this.The whole thing

18:30.457 --> 18:31.501
is awful.

18:31.545 --> 18:33.068
I feel for Alex.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.940
On top of everything else,
having to live with that memory.

18:35.984 --> 18:38.421
When did things start to change
between you and Steve?

18:38.465 --> 18:39.596
Well, Steve changed

18:39.640 --> 18:41.381
after he struck gold at work.

18:41.424 --> 18:43.992
Our whole marriage was
different after that point.

18:44.035 --> 18:46.690
He wanted to be part
of New York's moneyed world.

18:46.734 --> 18:49.040
I don't care
about that stuff as much.

18:49.084 --> 18:50.694
As much as Ella?

18:50.738 --> 18:53.610

28:47.769 --> 28:50.337
She never
used to do that.

28:51.773 --> 28:53.253

I have new friends, I guess.

28:58.998 --> 29:00.956
Kim tries,

29:01.000 --> 29:05.178

and it isn't the same.

29:05.221 --> 29:08.355
We aren't the same.

29:08.398 --> 29:12.054
Maybe Kim made that GIF for Alex
in an attempt to be included.

29:12.098 --> 29:13.839
Right, and she took
the stepmom hate

29:13.882 --> 29:17.059
to another level with a prank,
only it went very, very wrong.

29:17.103 --> 29:19.670
She's a smart kid.
One of her subjects is AP Chem.

29:19.714 --> 29:23.718
Top student might have
access to peroxides, acids.

29:23.762 --> 29:26.677
And the know-how
to use it discreetly.

KIM: It felt good
making everybody laugh.

29:29.115 --> 29:30.725

better than any of them.

29:35.295 --> 29:36.644
It's not fair.

29:36.687 --> 29:38.994
It's hard enough, you know?

On the upside, we understand you

You mentioned AP Chem.

29:45.522 --> 29:48.961
Students don't have access
to chemicals at school, do they?

29:49.004 --> 29:51.833
Just the teachers.

29:51.877 --> 29:54.531
And me. So what?

29:54.575 --> 29:55.837
LIZZIE: We have
reason to believe

29:55.881 --> 29:57.404
that a toxin was used on Ella.

29:57.447 --> 29:59.667
This toxin contributed
to her death.

29:59.710 --> 30:02.191
You're not saying my daughter
had something to do with this?

30:02.235 --> 30:04.846
I-It was cool
to hate on her stepmom,

30:04.890 --> 30:07.893
but I-I would never take it
to that level. Never.

30:09.720 --> 30:12.723

to call our lawyer.

of your new office?

30:20.862 --> 30:22.951

the sophistication.

30:26.215 --> 30:27.956

perfectly capable.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.393
She knows pH better
than her ABCs.

30:30.437 --> 30:33.440
And she did call Ella
"evil stepmom."

30:33.483 --> 30:36.660
Maybe she was trying to finish
the fairy tale on Alex's behalf.

30:36.704 --> 30:39.707

even know those fairy tales,

30:39.750 --> 30:41.840

on Instagram.

30:41.883 --> 30:43.798

30:45.365 --> 30:48.150

friendship lost.

30:48.194 --> 30:49.891
Alex left Kim behind.

30:49.935 --> 30:52.720
But why would Kim
hold Ella responsible for that?

30:52.763 --> 30:56.202
So who did Ella
leave behind?

30:57.943 --> 30:59.466
We've been looking
at the wrong friendship.

30:59.509 --> 31:01.294
Molly Tynan.

31:01.337 --> 31:02.904
Molly said that she and Ella
were best friends,

31:02.948 --> 31:04.210
how they counted
on each other.

31:04.253 --> 31:05.689
She even said
she wasn't sure

31:05.733 --> 31:07.691
what she'll do without Ella.

31:07.735 --> 31:08.910
They were both bakers.

31:08.954 --> 31:11.347
Maybe they had a culinary
idea or venture.

31:12.392 --> 31:13.567
DYLAN:
Hmm.

31:13.610 --> 31:15.874
LIZZIE: There it is.
They've been forging

31:15.917 --> 31:17.745
this business plan
since they were students.

31:17.788 --> 31:20.052
At least until
Ella married up,

31:20.095 --> 31:21.923
and then instead of being
a business partner,

31:21.967 --> 31:23.664
Molly found herself
in the role

31:23.707 --> 31:25.666
of hired help
at Ella's party.

31:25.709 --> 31:27.798
That has a sting to it.

31:27.842 --> 31:29.888
DYLAN:
Question now is,

31:29.931 --> 31:31.715
did Molly choose to sting back?

31:38.331 --> 31:39.810
If Molly truly did poison
her friend,

31:39.854 --> 31:41.160
what better place
to take Ella down

31:41.203 --> 31:43.292
than in front of her new
family and social circle.

31:43.336 --> 31:45.294
Okay, maybe behaviorally
it lines up,

31:45.338 --> 31:50.343
but we need something more
tangible to make it stick.

31:50.386 --> 31:52.606
What toxin could
this woman have used

31:52.649 --> 31:55.217
that wouldn't show up
on a general tox screen?

31:55.261 --> 31:56.827
Well, something specific,
specialized.

31:56.871 --> 31:58.829
She's a cook.
She knows ingredients.

31:58.873 --> 32:02.224
Ella's makeup had a
high alkaline trace.

32:02.268 --> 32:04.400
Fruit has a high
alkaline content.

32:04.444 --> 32:06.489
Poison fruit?

32:07.534 --> 32:09.928
The poison apple.

32:11.233 --> 32:14.410
A fairy tale symbol
of beauty, ugliness, envy.

32:14.454 --> 32:18.240
If bitten,
it causes a deathlike sleep.

32:18.284 --> 32:20.416
Ella wasn't the evil stepmother.

32:20.460 --> 32:23.550
She was Cinderella.

32:23.593 --> 32:25.682
It was her friend who is evil.

32:28.381 --> 32:30.383
Not all tales are make-believe.

32:30.426 --> 32:32.341
There is a real fruit
named manchineel.

32:33.299 --> 32:34.865
"The little apple of death."

32:34.909 --> 32:38.782
I doubt Molly would have been
cooking with poison apples.

32:38.826 --> 32:41.960
But a culinary artist would
know where to find them.

32:43.222 --> 32:45.789
The beach apple believed
to have killed Ponce de León

32:45.833 --> 32:47.443
was green, sweet-smelling.

32:47.487 --> 32:49.445
But the sap inside
was toxic,

32:49.489 --> 32:52.796
causing burn-like blisters
to the skin on contact.

32:52.840 --> 32:56.191
Mix a concentration of that
sap into some makeup and...

32:56.235 --> 32:58.106

becomes a swan dive.

32:58.150 --> 33:00.108

to do with it.
