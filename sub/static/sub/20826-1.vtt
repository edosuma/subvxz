Oh, Christ,
who keeps turning this up to 64?

03:28.215 --> 03:30.259
- Dad, it's cold.
- Quit your bitching, Kevin.

03:30.342 --> 03:32.135
Kids in Africa would kill

03:34.763 --> 03:37.766
You sold a friend of mine
some bad pixie dust, Tinker Bell,

03:37.849 --> 03:39.768
that made him think he could fly.

03:39.851 --> 03:41.645

That's the kind of man you
want to be: self-employed.

03:53.490 --> 03:55.492
Don't ever go back
to the department, Colt!

03:55.576 --> 03:58.370
They'll use you up
and hang you out to dry on Christmas!

03:58.453 --> 04:00.831
You'll wind up sitting there
with your freezing family

04:00.914 --> 04:02.749
waiting for the phone to ring!

04:02.833 --> 04:04.835
Don't worry, Dad.
They'll call you.

04:04.918 --> 04:08.090
That's right.
And it'll be Bob Pogo

04:08.125 --> 04:11.383
on his hands and knees
begging you to come back.

04:11.466 --> 04:14.970
There's no reason for us to be worried.
Everything's gonna be fine.

05:42.849 --> 05:43.850
What are you doing?

05:43.934 --> 05:45.811
I'm trying to figure out
which bill we can pay.

05:45.894 --> 05:49.398
Well, we got about eight inches
of free water falling right now.

05:49.481 --> 05:51.525
So, heat it is.

05:51.608 --> 05:55.195
Frank, we'll get through this.
We always do.

05:55.278 --> 05:57.656
I'm here for you. The kids love you.

05:57.739 --> 06:00.283
Mohican will realize their mistake
and take you back.

06:00.367 --> 06:03.078

you'll get a better job somewhere else.

06:03.161 --> 06:04.079
Yeah, sure.

06:06.415 --> 06:07.874
I'm gonna go downstairs.

06:07.958 --> 06:10.627
Oh, Sue, don't do that.
I haven't showered in days.

06:10.710 --> 06:12.838
I meant the kitchen, Frank.

06:14.548 --> 06:18.427
Get some sleep.
Tomorrow will be a better day.

Fantastic. No deliveries for you today,

09:52.432 --> 09:54.726
No, no. Uh-uh.

09:54.809 --> 09:58.730
You are going to leave this house
and enjoy the day with your family.

09:58.813 --> 10:00.190
I can't. Pogo might call.

10:00.273 --> 10:02.442
Frank, I'm your biggest cheerleader,

10:02.525 --> 10:05.403
but it's been three weeks
and Bob Pogo has not called yet.

10:05.487 --> 10:08.448
- And I doubt he'll call today.
- Your cheerleading needs work, Sue.

10:08.531 --> 10:12.994
And, if by some miracle he does call,
we have an answering machine.

10:13.078 --> 10:15.872
Come on, you've been a ghost around here
since Christmas.

10:15.956 --> 10:19.542
Now snap out of it
and be a part of this family again.

10:20.669 --> 10:24.089
- Okay, fine, I'll go sledding.
- Good.

10:24.172 --> 10:27.384
Because your attitude is starting
to affect the children.

10:27.467 --> 10:29.010
Just look at Bill.

10:29.552 --> 10:32.681
Come on, come on.

- Hey, Frank!

10:54.035 --> 10:55.912
Hey!

10:55.996 --> 10:58.832
Looks like your boy dinged my dangler.

10:58.915 --> 11:00.792

11:07.424 --> 11:09.843
Sorry about your van.
I'll pay for the damages.

11:09.926 --> 11:13.263
I can't take bread from my main man
who lost his gig.

11:13.346 --> 11:16.182
I remember once I was
out of work for a whole winter.

11:16.266 --> 11:19.644
Oh, wait, that was a vacation. Hawaii.

11:19.728 --> 11:22.814
Hey, Frank, you should go to Hawaii, man!

11:22.897 --> 11:24.232
It'll do you wonders.

11:24.315 --> 11:29.070
See a volcano, drink a volcano,
be a volcano.

11:30.238 --> 11:32.031

11:32.115 --> 11:34.325
This isn't my snowmobile!

11:35.618 --> 11:38.163
He's such a kind soul.

11:38.246 --> 11:39.956
He's a drug addict, Sue.

11:40.039 --> 11:43.042
This day sucks knob already.
I'll find a ride home.

11:46.296 --> 11:48.506
No fair. How come he can leave?

11:48.590 --> 11:51.176
Nobody's leaving! We just got here.

11:51.259 --> 11:54.053
Our fun is only starting.
Let's hit that hill!

11:54.137 --> 11:55.054

Ice-ball!

11:59.809 --> 12:01.227
Goddamn it!

12:01.311 --> 12:03.813
If you cross my path today, Murphy,

12:03.897 --> 12:06.858
I will scalp you, shit in the scalp,

12:06.941 --> 12:10.361
and slap it back on your head
so everybody calls you "shit wig" and...

12:10.445 --> 12:13.364
- Hey!
- Oh, man, don't hurt me!

12:13.448 --> 12:15.992
Yeah! You better run from me!

12:16.075 --> 12:19.704
I'm afraid of your wife,
you out-of-work pussyfart!

12:20.288 --> 12:22.499
You see that, Sue? Everybody knows.

12:23.374 --> 12:25.502
I can't even intimidate children anymore.

12:25.585 --> 12:28.338
Don't let him bother you, Frank.
He'll be in jail soon.

12:28.421 --> 12:31.174
We can still have fun. Smile a little!

12:31.257 --> 12:34.344
I'm trying, but I'm sick of all these
busybodies looking at me

12:34.427 --> 12:35.720
like I have a fatal disease.

12:35.804 --> 12:39.641
"Oh, you poor man,
how's the job hunt going?"

12:39.724 --> 12:42.143
"I don't know, lady,
how's your saggy tits going?"

12:42.227 --> 12:44.646
It's all in your head. People love you.

12:44.729 --> 12:46.397
Come on, cheer up.

12:46.481 --> 12:50.443
Look around you...
new fallen snow, you're with your family.

12:50.527 --> 12:52.987
I just know this is going
to be a great day.

12:53.071 --> 12:55.698
Sue? Sue Murphy?

12:55.782 --> 12:58.284
Oh, fuck me! Hi, Ginny!

12:58.368 --> 12:59.994
Oh, hi, Frank.

13:00.078 --> 13:02.872
How's the job hunt going, you poor thing?

13:02.956 --> 13:04.165
Any nibbles?

13:04.249 --> 13:06.251
I should've died in Korea.

13:06.334 --> 13:08.711
Go play with Maureen, that's fun!

13:09.629 --> 13:12.215
Sorry about Frank.
He hasn't been himself lately.

13:12.298 --> 13:16.511
That's all right. Failure can break down
even the strongest man.

13:16.594 --> 13:19.430
How are you? Must have been
a difficult Christmas after, you know,

13:19.514 --> 13:21.099
Greg abandoned you and the kids.

13:21.182 --> 13:23.101
Oh, no, we're back together!

13:23.184 --> 13:26.020
Greg took a Catholic cruise
with Father Pat

13:26.104 --> 13:29.065
and came back a different man.

13:29.148 --> 13:30.817
We're going at it like newlyweds!

13:33.152 --> 13:35.488
Well, that's a dirty mouth.

13:35.572 --> 13:39.367
Mister, I'm gonna shut you up.

13:41.494 --> 13:43.288
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, hi, stud!

13:44.372 --> 13:46.958
Dear Lord, give me strength.

13:48.126 --> 13:50.044
Vagina, vagina, vagina!

13:50.128 --> 13:52.630
Hey, baby! Looking attractive!

13:52.714 --> 13:54.716
Christ, I hate it here.

13:54.799 --> 13:56.593
Bunch of kids. No chicks.

13:56.676 --> 13:59.804
Yeah, like you'd know
what to do with one, you virgin!

13:59.888 --> 14:00.847
I know more than you!

14:00.930 --> 14:04.225
Are you forgetting about that fox
at the lake I boned all last summer?

14:04.309 --> 14:05.935
How come we never met her?

14:06.019 --> 14:09.314
I told you she died of leukemia.

14:09.397 --> 14:10.732
Last time you said it was polio.

14:10.815 --> 14:13.610
Polio is a gateway disease
to leukemia, stupid.

14:14.569 --> 14:17.113
Hey, look, Claire's here.

14:17.196 --> 14:19.699
Oh, she's so fine.

14:19.782 --> 14:22.243
Why don't you fuck her, Kevin?

14:22.327 --> 14:24.204
I blew my shot with her.

14:24.287 --> 14:28.124
She was just about to touch it when
my stupid brother boner-blocked me.

14:28.208 --> 14:29.834
I'll never get laid.

14:29.918 --> 14:32.837
Hey, you know,
I heard about this loose girl

14:32.921 --> 14:35.381
that goes to Roberto Clemente High.

14:35.465 --> 14:38.885
She asks you to come to her house
for a free haircut.

14:38.968 --> 14:41.638
And then she fucks you.

14:41.721 --> 14:43.973
Well, that's something. What's her name?

14:44.057 --> 14:47.143
- I don't know. Haircut Girl?
- That's no help!

14:47.227 --> 14:49.229
Oh, fuck it. I'm gonna go talk to Claire.

14:49.312 --> 14:52.148
- No, you're not.
- Oh, yeah? Watch me.

14:52.232 --> 14:54.192
I will not die a virgin.

14:54.817 --> 14:55.985
Ow! My dick!

14:56.069 --> 14:59.697
Goddamn it, Maureen. Don't sit like that.
It isn't ladylike.

14:59.781 --> 15:01.241
I don't want to be ladylike.

15:01.324 --> 15:03.576
Yes, you do. That's why you're joining
the Honeybee Scouts,

15:03.660 --> 15:06.663
so you can play with normal kids
instead of those two animals.

15:06.746 --> 15:09.082
I'm getting cleaned!

15:10.208 --> 15:12.335
I don't want to be a Honeybee Scout.

15:12.418 --> 15:14.462
I like rockets and computers.

15:14.545 --> 15:16.547
So marry an astronaut.

15:16.631 --> 15:19.509
But for now, go play with those girls
down there doing girl stuff.

15:19.592 --> 15:20.677
Dad!

15:26.891 --> 15:29.644
- What're you guys doing?
- Waking up fish.

15:30.895 --> 15:32.188
Cool!

15:32.272 --> 15:33.481
I give up.

15:33.564 --> 15:36.359
Christ, she's got bigger balls than Bill.

15:36.442 --> 15:39.153
Fight for my pleasure!

15:41.239 --> 15:43.616
That jerk ruins everything fun.

15:43.700 --> 15:45.702
We have to stand up to him this year.

15:45.785 --> 15:49.038
I just curl into a ball
and sing "Hot Cross Buns."

15:49.122 --> 15:52.125
No! There's two of us and one of him.

15:52.208 --> 15:55.795
If we both fought him at the same time,
there's no way he...

15:55.878 --> 15:57.005
Ow!

15:57.088 --> 15:58.965
That one had a turd in it!

15:59.048 --> 16:00.258

16:20.987 --> 16:23.906
I like your army jacket.
Is it from a real dead guy?

16:23.990 --> 16:27.734
You're funny.
Hey, you want to come back

16:27.769 --> 16:29.996
to my house
and watch TV or something?

16:30.079 --> 16:33.207

16:33.208 --> 16:35.418
so she's gone for a few days.

16:52.310 --> 16:53.853
It wasn't lucky.

16:54.979 --> 16:58.066
It's such a blessing
to have a husband who's so happy.

16:58.149 --> 16:59.567
He's always singing.

16:59.650 --> 17:03.237
- He loves to color my hair and do my...
- Ginny, please stop.

17:03.321 --> 17:07.241
I'm really glad you and Greg are happy,
but we are not doing well, okay?

17:07.325 --> 17:09.077
Frank's depressed right now.

17:09.160 --> 17:11.788
Maybe he should take a Pray Away cruise.

17:11.871 --> 17:14.457
We can barely afford
to put gas in the car right now.

17:14.540 --> 17:17.417
It's just, he's really down in the dumps.

17:17.502 --> 17:21.464
- He's usually so full of life.
- Well, that's one way of putting it.

17:21.547 --> 17:23.633
I just want my husband back.

17:26.594 --> 17:27.595
Maureen!

17:29.138 --> 17:30.807
Maureen!

17:30.890 --> 17:35.311
Them fish look like mama
after she takes her arm vitamins.

17:35.395 --> 17:39.440
Maureen, get off the goddamn ice!
You're gonna fall through!

17:41.275 --> 17:43.528
You forgot your pussy!

17:47.532 --> 17:52.078
No! Daddy, water!
Daddy, water!

17:52.829 --> 17:54.622
It's okay, buddy, it's okay.

17:54.705 --> 17:58.835
Only your butt got wet,
what the fuck is wrong with you?

17:58.918 --> 18:01.838
He almost drowned as a baby,
you heartless whore!

18:01.921 --> 18:03.714
I did?

18:03.798 --> 18:06.801
Daddy, Billy kicked me
in the eye a little.

18:06.884 --> 18:08.848
Jesus Christ!

18:09.762 --> 18:11.764
- Daddy, water! Daddy, water!
- Frank?

18:11.848 --> 18:14.267
Sue, start the car,
we're going to the hospital!

18:14.350 --> 18:17.662
You're grounded! Out of my way!
My daughter's bleeding to death!

18:18.521 --> 18:20.481
Wait for me, Mommy!

18:23.568 --> 18:25.903
All right, my daughter
needs a doctor right away!

18:25.987 --> 18:29.157
Listen, take a seat, fill this out
and we'll get to you as soon as we can.

18:29.240 --> 18:31.451
Oh, no. No, no, no, no!
I don't fill things out.

18:31.452 --> 18:33.453
You fill things out.
She needs a doctor.

18:33.536 --> 18:35.455
Yeah, how about she waits
like the rest of us?

18:35.538 --> 18:36.914
How about I take the
brake off that thing

18:36.915 --> 18:38.291
and send you right out into the snow?

18:38.374 --> 18:40.593
My daughter needs a doctor right now!

18:41.961 --> 18:43.171
Daddy, wa-wa.

18:43.254 --> 18:45.548
Oh, for corn sakes.
That boy has hypothermia.

18:45.631 --> 18:47.925
Yeah, he'll be fine.
Here's a blanket.

18:48.009 --> 18:49.051
Ah! My foot!

18:49.135 --> 18:52.180
Relax, you fucking Mary!
Get my daughter a doctor!

18:52.263 --> 18:54.911
I will have you thrown
out of here, mister,

18:54.912 --> 18:57.560
if you don't get your
emotions under control.

18:57.643 --> 19:01.439
My emotions?
You mean my love for my own child?

19:01.522 --> 19:03.649
Let me tell you something... "Beatrice."

19:03.733 --> 19:05.526
I don't know what country you're from,

19:05.610 --> 19:08.404
but I didn't die for five minutes
on a Korean battlefield

19:08.488 --> 19:11.908
to come home and be disrespected
by a woman like you.

19:11.991 --> 19:13.659
You think because I'm unemployed,

19:13.743 --> 19:16.370
you can just shove me
and my family to the back of the line?

19:16.454 --> 19:18.456
Well, not on my watch!

19:18.539 --> 19:20.791
If you don't get her a doctor right now,

19:20.875 --> 19:24.128
before all these other
low-life pieces of shit,

19:24.212 --> 19:27.757
then I will follow you to whatever home
for dried-up old hags you live in,

19:27.840 --> 19:31.052
slap the cat food out of your mouth,
grab you by your camel hump

19:31.135 --> 19:34.057
and put you through that fucking wall!

19:34.680 --> 19:35.515
Oh, boy.

19:41.020 --> 19:42.998
- There's our hero.
- Wha...

19:43.033 --> 19:45.399
- What happened?
- You passed out.

19:45.483 --> 19:48.444
And then everybody in the waiting room
started clapping.

19:48.528 --> 19:53.074
Well, the main thing is you're all right
and Maureen's gonna be fine.

19:53.157 --> 19:54.992
Daddy, I'm a pirate!

19:55.076 --> 19:58.579
Oh, for Christ sakes, Maureen,
girls can't be pirates!

19:59.622 --> 20:01.207
You're back!

20:04.460 --> 20:07.505
Dad, it's so cool
when you scream at other people.

20:07.588 --> 20:11.425
My little girl's eye is more important
than some crazy old man's foot.

20:11.509 --> 20:13.636
- He's fine!
- He died, Dad.

20:14.762 --> 20:18.099
Well, he should have spoke up!
Squeaky wheel!

20:18.182 --> 20:20.226
You're my squeaky wheel.

20:20.309 --> 20:22.270
And you were magnificent.

20:22.353 --> 20:24.939
Sometimes a man's got to do
what a man does.

20:25.022 --> 20:28.568
And a man feeds his family!
I'm taking you all to dinner!

20:28.651 --> 20:29.986
- Yeah!
- All right!

20:30.069 --> 20:31.862
Frank, a restaurant?

20:31.946 --> 20:34.323
Isn't that a little extravagant right now?

20:34.407 --> 20:36.450
Oh, we're fine, Sue.

20:36.534 --> 20:38.995
This might be the adrenaline shot
to the heart speaking,

20:39.078 --> 20:40.788
but I feel great again!

20:41.414 --> 20:44.875
- Ooh, can we eat there?
- No, that's a titty bar now, Bill.

20:44.959 --> 20:49.171
Your old man is gonna take you
to the fanciest place in town.

20:56.304 --> 20:58.639
And so, you know,
I had nothing better to do,

20:58.723 --> 21:01.642
TV was on the fritz,
so I figured, yeah, why not?

21:01.726 --> 21:03.227
I might as well get married.

21:04.270 --> 21:07.106
It's funny when you pretend
you hate each other.

21:07.189 --> 21:08.524
Tell us the real story.

21:08.608 --> 21:12.153
- It was such a lovely summer day...
- I'll take this whenever you're ready.

21:12.236 --> 21:15.615
- Thank you.
- Your father looked so handsome.

21:15.698 --> 21:19.327
Grampa Joe walked me down the aisle
and I wore my mother's dress,

21:19.410 --> 21:23.247
little Cindy was the flower girl,
Monsignor Kreger married us.

21:23.331 --> 21:25.666
- Who?
- He's Father Pat's father. Long story.

21:25.750 --> 21:30.046
And of course I didn't know then
that you three angels were coming.

21:30.129 --> 21:31.839
But I looked at your father

21:31.922 --> 21:33.924
- and I'll never forget...
- Excuse me, miss? Miss?

21:34.008 --> 21:36.010
- Yes, sir?
- What's this?

21:36.093 --> 21:39.639
Three Plantation Dogs,
an Uncle Tom Turkey Platter,

21:39.722 --> 21:42.016
White Meat Supreme, Two Clucks Clams...

21:42.099 --> 21:45.353
Okay, you charged us for eight drinks.
There's only five of us.

21:45.436 --> 21:48.397
- Refills are free.
- Oh, yes, they used to be,

21:48.481 --> 21:51.984
but we changed our policy
a few years back.

21:52.068 --> 21:54.737
Well, I wasn't notified.
You should've put that in writing.

21:54.820 --> 22:00.076
Oh, we did, sir. It's on the wall, on
the table, and from what I've been told,

22:00.159 --> 22:02.203
it's facing you when you use the urinal.

22:02.286 --> 22:05.706
Well, I didn't come here to read,
I came here to eat!

22:05.790 --> 22:08.417
Now, take these off of my check,
you bunch of chiselers!

22:13.881 --> 22:16.926
Oh, oh, oh. I understand.

22:17.593 --> 22:22.765
If you're having a difficult time
right now, we have an "indigent can."

22:22.848 --> 22:24.892
It's near the register.

22:24.975 --> 22:28.813
- I'm no charity case.
- Oh, of course not, you're a human being.

22:28.896 --> 22:30.564
But between you and me,

22:30.648 --> 22:33.651
we throw the extra food
in the trash every night,

22:33.734 --> 22:35.444
so if you get here before midnight,

22:35.528 --> 22:38.322
you won't have to fight
the other vagrants for it.

22:38.406 --> 22:40.366
Daddy, do we have to eat garbage?

22:40.449 --> 22:42.284
Nobody's eating garbage, princess!

22:42.368 --> 22:43.869
Now, let me tell you something, lady...

22:43.953 --> 22:46.789
How dare you insinuate
my husband can't pay!

22:46.872 --> 22:48.958
- Sue, butt out.
- He can pay for this!

22:49.041 --> 22:52.253
- I can?
- Open your wallet. You've got it.

22:52.336 --> 22:56.132
Oh. Goddamn right I have it!
Here!

22:56.841 --> 23:00.177
We're leaving,
and we will never drink your

23:00.178 --> 23:02.304
overpriced "Runaway Root Beers" again.

23:02.388 --> 23:06.058
But here's a nice tip because
you gave us very good service.

23:15.359 --> 23:16.861
Where did that money come from?

23:16.944 --> 23:20.322
- Just be glad I had it.
- Thank you.

23:20.406 --> 23:22.408
It's okay. We're a team.

23:23.951 --> 23:25.870
What the hell are we gonna do?

23:25.953 --> 23:29.331
I know one thing.
We're gonna put on a brave face.

23:29.415 --> 23:33.127
It's best that the kids
don't know how bad things are right now.

23:33.711 --> 23:37.465
We... are... fucked.

23:44.513 --> 23:47.892
Ooh, it's colder in here
than it is outside.

23:56.817 --> 23:59.236
Okay, Kevin, I'm coming in now!

23:59.320 --> 24:01.503
<i>I'm not doing anything!</i>

24:29.683 --> 24:31.894
<i>One new message.</i>

24:31.977 --> 24:34.522
<i>Frank, it's Bob Pogo.</i>

24:34.605 --> 24:38.734
<i>We used to work together
at Mohican... Airways.</i>

24:38.817 --> 24:42.530
<i>It's an airline... down at the airport.</i>

24:42.613 --> 24:46.408
<i>Aw, shit, you know who I am!
Here's the thing...</i>

24:46.492 --> 24:50.162
<i>- Is somebody there?
- Jesus, Dolores, hang up the extension!</i>

24:50.246 --> 24:53.082
<i>You don't have to bite my head off.</i>

24:53.165 --> 24:56.502
<i>I'm sorry, dear. Don't cry.</i>

24:56.585 --> 24:59.129
<i>- So, Frank...
- Apology accepted.</i>

24:59.213 --> 25:02.633
<i>For God's sakes,
you're the only woman for me,</i>

25:02.716 --> 25:05.427
<i>now hang up the fucking phone!</i>

25:07.638 --> 25:12.601
<i>Listen, your skills are missed
around here, Frank. I need you.</i>

25:12.685 --> 25:14.019
Oh, my God.

25:14.103 --> 25:17.856
<i>So, how about you come see me
at the airport tomorrow?</i>

25:17.940 --> 25:20.568
<i>It'll be great to have you back.</i>

25:23.153 --> 25:26.824
Yes! Yes!
Oh, God, yes!

25:26.907 --> 25:28.909
All right, Frank.
