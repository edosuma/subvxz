00:01.435 --> 00:02.536
(Clattering)

00:02.570 --> 00:03.637
Bruce:
Ah ! Ahhh!
Crap sandwich.

00:03.671 --> 00:05.039
Are you okay, honey?

00:05.073 --> 00:06.707
All right, you know what?
I have had enough, okay?

00:06.740 --> 00:08.176
Gustaf left these laying
around in the hallway.

00:08.209 --> 00:09.543
Actually that was me,

00:09.577 --> 00:11.045
because we're going
skiing today.

00:11.079 --> 00:12.546
It's a family
tradition.
Oh.

00:12.580 --> 00:13.714
Sounds nice. Have fun.

00:13.747 --> 00:15.116
Yeah, but you're
coming with.

00:15.149 --> 00:16.850
We're family now, remember?

00:16.884 --> 00:17.885
So can you ski?

00:17.918 --> 00:19.987
Can I ski? Uh, no.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.523
I played baseball and
basketball for four
years in college,

00:22.556 --> 00:24.392
but I can't walk on snow.

00:24.425 --> 00:26.360
(Laughing)
Can you ski?

00:26.394 --> 00:28.496
Well, I'm okay, I guess.

00:28.529 --> 00:31.232
I mean, I-I used to compete,
like, when I was younger,

00:31.265 --> 00:33.501
but that's a long
time ago now.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.703
Check this out.
Now I'm not...
What's this?

00:35.736 --> 00:37.071
What do you mean,
what's this?

00:37.105 --> 00:38.506
This is my
high school scrapbook.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.674
My parents
put it together.
Check it out: MVP.

00:40.708 --> 00:42.776
Oh, my God,
this is amazing.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.878
I know, I was
really good.
No, no,

00:44.912 --> 00:47.148
the fact that you
kept this is amazing.

00:47.181 --> 00:49.350
Aww, that's so cute.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.152
Of course I kept it.
I was a great athlete.

00:51.185 --> 00:52.720
Of course
you were, honey.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.256
Where's your scrapbook?

00:55.289 --> 00:56.857
Well, I don't have one.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.292
Maybe 'cause you
didn't have anything
to put in there.

00:58.326 --> 00:59.693
Or maybe I did.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.895
I once beat Anja PÃ¤rson
in a race.

01:01.929 --> 01:03.531
Okay, nobody knows
who that is.

01:03.564 --> 01:06.234
She's only one of
the best downhill
skiers ever.

01:06.267 --> 01:07.701
Olympic champion.

01:07.735 --> 01:08.802
Yeah, but the
Winter Olympics.

01:08.836 --> 01:11.205
That's like the Olympics
for pale people.

01:12.506 --> 01:13.774
You know what, honey?

01:13.807 --> 01:15.409
Sometimes
I'm really happy

01:15.443 --> 01:17.478
no one is around
to hear you speak.

01:17.511 --> 01:19.780
Okay, you know what?
You're just jealous
of my scrapbook.

01:19.813 --> 01:22.150
(Clacking)

01:22.183 --> 01:23.684
Get your own.

01:23.717 --> 01:26.754
* We're not living in America

01:26.787 --> 01:30.023
* But we're not sorry

01:30.057 --> 01:31.659
* I knew there was something

01:31.692 --> 01:33.861
* That we never had

01:33.894 --> 01:36.730
* We don't worry

01:36.764 --> 01:40.067
* No, we're not
living in America *

01:40.100 --> 01:44.037
* But we're not sorry, no

01:44.071 --> 01:47.241
* We don't care
about the world today *

01:47.275 --> 01:50.244
* We're not sorry

01:50.278 --> 01:53.547
* For you

01:53.581 --> 01:57.451
* My baby, baby, baby, baby

01:57.485 --> 01:58.419
* Ahh

01:59.753 --> 02:01.555
So what's your
plan, Gustaf?

02:01.589 --> 02:03.357
Two, maybe
three eggs.

02:03.391 --> 02:04.592
Orange juice.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.760
I don't know.
Cheese, candy.

02:06.794 --> 02:09.597
Okay, I'm...
I'm thinking
of a life plan.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.599
You know, you need
to make a checklist.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.867
(Crack)
Like, apartment,
job, girlfriend.

02:13.901 --> 02:16.404
Maybe a dog.
Oh, so many things.

02:16.437 --> 02:18.172
It's, like, four things.

02:18.206 --> 02:20.073
And you should focus
on the apartment first.

02:20.107 --> 02:22.743
News flash, Emma:
I'm living here,
so check.

02:22.776 --> 02:25.646
Okay, uncheck.
You can't stay here.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.681
Have you even started
looking for other places?

02:27.715 --> 02:28.982
Gustaf:
No.

02:29.016 --> 02:31.084
Maybe that's part of
the problem, you know?

02:31.118 --> 02:33.621
You won't find a place
if you don't start
looking for one.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.656
As the old saying goes:

02:35.689 --> 02:37.858
it's when you least
look for something

02:37.891 --> 02:39.927
that you find it...
most.

02:41.729 --> 02:43.197
I don't think
that's an old saying.

02:43.231 --> 02:44.332
Do you want me
to help you?

02:44.365 --> 02:46.700
No! Don't treat me
like a child.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.802
I'm thirty and
a half years old.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.238
I can do this
by myself.

02:50.271 --> 02:51.171
Okay.

02:52.373 --> 02:54.308
(In Swedish)

02:56.143 --> 02:58.246
Gustaf:
So, what's on the list again?

02:58.279 --> 02:59.347
Apartment.

02:59.380 --> 03:01.315
Apartment.
Job.

03:01.349 --> 03:02.983
Job...
(In Swedish)

03:03.016 --> 03:05.185
Girlfriend.
Girlfriend.

03:05.219 --> 03:07.855
Dog...
(In Swedish)

03:07.888 --> 03:10.057
Got it.
Let's get started.

03:10.090 --> 03:11.024
Mmm.

03:12.893 --> 03:14.495
Apartments
are this way.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.597
What?
The apartments
are this way.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.799
I know. This is
the freezer, Bruce.

03:18.832 --> 03:21.034
No, that's the
refrigerator.
The refrigerator.

03:21.068 --> 03:23.003
(Gentle thumping)

04:01.041 --> 04:02.042
(Thumping)

04:05.012 --> 04:05.946
(Tongue clicking)

04:09.116 --> 04:10.318
Check it out.

04:10.351 --> 04:11.385
Look how good
these look.

04:11.419 --> 04:12.953
Mm, those are
my old ones.

04:12.986 --> 04:14.488
These are
women's pants?
Yeah,

04:14.522 --> 04:16.390
but don't worry.
You look hot.

04:16.424 --> 04:18.058
Oh, my God,
look at your ass!

04:18.091 --> 04:19.693
You look like J. Lo.

04:19.727 --> 04:20.928
Is that a good thing
or a bad thing?

04:20.961 --> 04:23.397
It... depends, I guess.
(Door closing)

04:26.166 --> 04:27.801
Dog. Check.

04:27.835 --> 04:29.703
You bought a dog?

04:29.737 --> 04:32.440
You can't buy and
sell dogs, Bruce,

04:32.473 --> 04:34.107
they're not
human beings.

04:34.141 --> 04:35.809
Okay, there's
so much wrong with
that statement,

04:35.843 --> 04:37.411
I don't even know
where to begin.

04:37.445 --> 04:38.512
What's its name?

04:38.546 --> 04:41.181
Well, he can't
tell me, can he?

04:41.214 --> 04:42.916
I hereby name you...

04:45.218 --> 04:46.654
Gustaf's Dog.

04:46.687 --> 04:48.522
I think you started
on the wrong end
of the list.

04:48.556 --> 04:50.324
I said apartment
and job first.

04:50.358 --> 04:51.659
Well, it just
so happens

04:51.692 --> 04:53.293
that I'm going see
an apartment today.

04:53.327 --> 04:55.896
So, in your face!

04:55.929 --> 04:58.065
Ah, poor dog.

04:58.098 --> 05:00.368
Gustaf's Dog.
Poor, Gustaf's Dog.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.503
(Music)

05:05.038 --> 05:09.009
(Music)

05:17.485 --> 05:20.120
No, Bruce, Bruce.
I-I'll pack the car.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.823
You know, the packing
has to be...

05:27.495 --> 05:28.429
To be safe.

06:06.366 --> 06:07.601
Why does everyone
keep saying Bruce?

06:13.273 --> 06:14.207
(Singing)

06:18.378 --> 06:20.280
(All singing)

06:40.668 --> 06:42.836
Did you hear that,
Gustaf's Dog?

06:42.870 --> 06:44.638
There's seven
more rooms.

06:54.014 --> 06:56.216
Hello, my name
is Cecilia.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.486
Hello.
Hello, old lady.

06:58.519 --> 07:00.220
Yes.
(Strained laugh)

08:03.651 --> 08:04.552
Birger: (Singing)

08:10.991 --> 08:12.960
(Singing continues)

08:27.440 --> 08:28.408
(Laughing)

08:31.378 --> 08:33.013
It's an old pile of garbage.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.314
It's not that bad.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.984
No, it's literally
an old pile of garbage.

08:37.017 --> 08:37.918
Birger:

08:40.053 --> 08:41.989
Viveka:
Birger:

08:44.124 --> 08:54.968
(Music)

08:55.002 --> 08:56.904
(Electronic beep)

08:56.937 --> 08:58.606
(Annoyed sigh)

09:00.974 --> 09:02.209
Honey, you have
something on here,

09:02.242 --> 09:03.143
you know, so...

09:05.579 --> 09:07.247
You're a child.
It was funny though.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.482
Emma:
Ah, that's us!

09:11.685 --> 09:14.755
So, this guy
needs, uh, to rent
a pair of skis.

09:14.788 --> 09:16.590
Then you've come
to the right place.
Mm.

09:16.624 --> 09:17.891
Eh, what level
are you, sir?

09:17.925 --> 09:21.995
I don't know, probably
like... semi-advanced.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.897
Semi-advanced?

09:23.931 --> 09:26.233
I'm guessing
somewhere in between
advanced and expert.

09:26.266 --> 09:28.468
Like, how much have
you skied before?

09:28.501 --> 09:29.436
Before today?

09:30.838 --> 09:32.039
Uh, technically never,

09:32.072 --> 09:33.473
but I was a really good
athlete in high school.

09:33.506 --> 09:34.808
You never skied?
No.

09:34.842 --> 09:36.476
Then I would recommend
our ski school,
for beginners.

09:36.509 --> 09:38.078
If you come
with me please.

09:38.111 --> 09:39.579
Beginners?
No, I can walk.

09:39.613 --> 09:40.981
I've never been a
beginner at anything.

09:41.014 --> 09:42.549
Maybe that's a
good idea honey.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.551
For what, to learn
how to walk

09:44.584 --> 09:46.319
with long shoes on snow?

09:46.353 --> 09:47.921
Yeah.
Are you going to
go to ski school?

09:47.955 --> 09:49.723
No, because
I know how to ski.

09:49.757 --> 09:52.092
I once beat
Anja PÃ¤rson
in this slope.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.526
When I was 12.

09:53.560 --> 09:55.162
Wow. Well done.
Thank you.

09:55.195 --> 09:56.664
Except, she has
no evidence of it.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.598
No pictures;
there's no scrapbook

09:58.632 --> 10:00.968
or anything like
that, so.
We Swedes don't
like to brag,

10:01.001 --> 10:02.936
unlike some Americans.

10:02.970 --> 10:04.805
(Singsong)
Kind of sounds like
you're bragging right now.

10:04.838 --> 10:05.839
Well, actually,

10:05.873 --> 10:07.140
Anja is here today.

10:07.174 --> 10:08.275
So you could
just ask her.

10:08.308 --> 10:09.977
She is?
Yeah.
For real?

10:10.010 --> 10:11.645
Then she'll tell you.

10:11.679 --> 10:13.814
So, beginners skis
for you, sir?
Emma:
Yes.

10:13.847 --> 10:16.950
And then we want
to sign up for
the ski school.

10:16.984 --> 10:18.118
Okay, I'll do it,

10:18.151 --> 10:19.787
but it's not going
to take me long, okay?

10:19.820 --> 10:22.723
It's going to be
no problem whatsoever.

10:22.756 --> 10:24.491
Okay, let's ski
this mo-fo.

10:27.060 --> 10:29.997
I don't now how to...
talk ski language...

10:30.030 --> 10:31.064
No.
No.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.768
(Music)

10:38.571 --> 10:39.773
(Laugh)

10:59.259 --> 11:01.228
(Shouting)

11:08.668 --> 11:10.037
I'm sorry, I don't
speak any Swedish.

11:14.808 --> 11:16.309
Children:
Okay.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.411
We start by warming up
your hands and wrists.

11:19.913 --> 11:21.481
Can we move this along?
I just need to know the basics,

11:21.514 --> 11:22.850
then I'm out of here.

11:22.883 --> 11:25.685
Warming up is important
to don't hurt yourself.

11:26.987 --> 11:28.355
Okay,

11:28.388 --> 11:29.589
one by one,

11:29.622 --> 11:31.491
ski down into my arms.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.228
Good! Good work.

11:35.262 --> 11:41.401
(Music)

11:41.434 --> 11:42.535
Instructor:
Here...

11:42.569 --> 11:45.238
Ehh, take your
skis like this,
Yeah...

11:45.272 --> 11:47.607
down and out.
Yeah. Yeah.

11:47.640 --> 11:54.047
(Music)

11:54.081 --> 11:55.148
Up with you again
I'll get it,

11:55.182 --> 11:56.616
and try again.
I'll get it.

11:56.649 --> 11:58.051
You'll get it soon.

11:58.085 --> 11:59.319
Bruce:
Thanks.

12:02.890 --> 12:03.991
You know what,
this is crap.

12:04.024 --> 12:05.458
I'm going to
make a run for it.

12:05.492 --> 12:07.494
I'll see you
on the outside.

12:10.130 --> 12:11.564
Instructor:
Here, wait!

12:12.833 --> 12:15.435
Here, I will
help you back.

12:19.472 --> 12:21.942
You must turn around.
Yeah, I know.

12:21.975 --> 12:23.543
It's much tougher
than I thought.

12:25.678 --> 12:27.147
You'll fix it.
I got it.

14:19.592 --> 14:21.661
Ohh, I'm sorry
I'm late.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.696
I've been chasing
Anja PÃ¤rson for
almost an hour now.

14:23.730 --> 14:25.632
She's pretty
fast nowadays.

14:25.665 --> 14:26.833
What's that?

14:26.866 --> 14:28.135
I have no idea.

14:30.270 --> 14:31.905
It's going much slower
than I would like.

14:31.939 --> 14:33.941
Really? I thought you
were mister athlete.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.442
I am. I'm good
at sports,

14:35.475 --> 14:36.809
but skiing is
not a sport.

14:36.843 --> 14:37.877
It's not?

14:37.911 --> 14:39.112
No, it's an activity.

14:39.146 --> 14:40.180
There's no ball.

14:40.213 --> 14:41.648
Sport has to have
hand-eye coordination,

14:41.681 --> 14:43.883
not hand-foot
coordination.

14:43.917 --> 14:45.618
So, what about soccer?

14:45.652 --> 14:47.254
Soccer is
technically a sport,

14:47.287 --> 14:49.422
but it's way below
all the other
handsy sports.

14:49.456 --> 14:51.224
(Cellphone ringing)

14:51.258 --> 14:52.825
Do you ever think
before you speak?

14:52.859 --> 14:54.127
It's my mother,
sorry.
Right.

14:54.161 --> 14:55.395
I've got to take this.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.250
In your face!

15:17.284 --> 15:18.718
Whoo! Yeah!

15:18.751 --> 15:21.021
(Chanting)
Who's your daddy?
Who's your daddy?

15:21.054 --> 15:23.256
Who's your daddy?
Who's your daddy?

15:30.663 --> 15:32.699
So what are you
up to today, Bruce?

15:32.732 --> 15:34.567
Bruce: (On phone)
Uh, actually we're skiing.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.069
Hey, you're not going
to believe this,

15:36.103 --> 15:37.704
but over here
they think that's a sport.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.006
No way.
I know!

15:39.039 --> 15:40.273
It's unbelievable, right?

15:40.307 --> 15:41.541
Nancy: (On phone)
Skiing is like walking

15:41.574 --> 15:45.312
on long shoes in the snow.

15:45.345 --> 15:48.515
That's hilarious that they
think skiing is a sport.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.417
You live in a very
strange country, Bruce.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.052
I know, strange,

15:52.085 --> 15:54.054
but it's actually
pretty beautiful.

15:54.087 --> 15:56.123
You guys should really come
visit in the winter sometime.

15:56.156 --> 15:58.425
Oh, we will.
Yeah, maybe next winter,

15:58.458 --> 15:59.993
if you guys want to
book a trip or something...

16:00.027 --> 16:02.095
On Friday.

16:02.129 --> 16:04.697
What?
Yes, we are coming on Friday.

16:05.865 --> 16:07.700
This Friday?
Yes!

16:07.734 --> 16:09.502
I mean, you and
Emma are so busy

16:09.536 --> 16:11.238
planning the wedding, right?

16:11.271 --> 16:13.540
And so me and Dad are
just going to come over.

16:13.573 --> 16:16.876
We'll help out and we'll just
plan everything for you,

16:16.909 --> 16:18.645
make sure everything
turns out right.

16:18.678 --> 16:20.047
Big surprise, huh?

16:20.080 --> 16:22.182
Yeahh...

16:22.215 --> 16:25.118
Oh, Brucie, I wish I could
see your face right now.

16:26.919 --> 16:27.954
This Friday?

16:27.987 --> 16:29.256
Yeah, this Friday.

16:29.289 --> 16:30.690
And they've already
booked their tickets.

16:30.723 --> 16:32.559
So hypothetically,

16:32.592 --> 16:34.427
if you want to cancel
someone else's ticket,
how would you do it?

16:34.461 --> 16:36.896
You know what else she said?
Skiing is not a sport.

16:36.929 --> 16:38.365
Oh well, I guess
it's settled then.

16:38.398 --> 16:39.399
Yeah, it's an activity.

16:39.432 --> 16:40.733
And I just mastered it.

16:40.767 --> 16:43.036
What?
I just mastered the fine
activity of skiing.

16:43.070 --> 16:45.438
You just mastered the
fine activity of skiing?

16:45.472 --> 16:47.440
Yeah, I think so.
We have time
for one more run

16:47.474 --> 16:49.209
if you want to.
I wish I could,

16:49.242 --> 16:50.543
but the slope's
already closed.

16:50.577 --> 16:51.878
The kids' slope, yes.

16:51.911 --> 16:53.380
I would,
I certainly would,

16:53.413 --> 16:55.014
but, um, I'm sore

16:55.048 --> 16:57.084
from all this
advanced skiing.

16:57.117 --> 16:58.985
Come on, you can
go with me in
the big slope

16:59.018 --> 17:01.688
now that you've totally
mastered skiing.

17:01.721 --> 17:04.124
Listen, all I'm saying
is it's not as hard as I
thought it was going to be.

17:04.157 --> 17:06.393
Okay? They said
I was one of their
best students.

17:06.426 --> 17:08.995
Yeah, but the
other students
were kids, honey.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.098
Come on, I just
want to see how
good you've become.

17:11.131 --> 17:13.133
First, you have
something here.

17:13.166 --> 17:14.401
(Wheezing laugh)

17:14.434 --> 17:16.103
You're so gullible.

17:16.136 --> 17:17.670
Listen, babe,
I love you,

17:17.704 --> 17:18.771
you know that, right?

17:18.805 --> 17:20.039
Let's just forget
about this.

17:20.073 --> 17:21.208
We'll go back inside,

17:21.241 --> 17:23.176
It's on.
forget this ever hap...

17:23.210 --> 17:24.577
What is on? I don't...

18:27.073 --> 18:28.341
What are you doing?

18:28.375 --> 18:30.177
I'm warming up.
It's important
to warm up.

18:30.210 --> 18:32.479
Okay. So let's go.

18:32.512 --> 18:34.347
Hey, can't we
just wait a bit?

18:34.381 --> 18:36.216
Why?
Okay, you know what?

18:36.249 --> 18:37.784
Maybe you were
right, all right?

18:37.817 --> 18:40.520
Maybe Americans tend
to over-exaggerate
a bit and brag a bit,

18:40.553 --> 18:42.622
but you Swedes,
you do the opposite.
That's even worse.

18:42.655 --> 18:44.157
Okay? You said you
weren't good at skiing.

18:44.191 --> 18:45.792
You're great at skiing.
You're super good.

18:45.825 --> 18:47.394
You should have your
own friggin' scrapbook.

18:47.427 --> 18:49.396
I know! So let's race.

18:49.429 --> 18:51.198
One, two, three...
I can't!

18:51.231 --> 18:52.565
I can't, okay? I can't!

18:52.599 --> 18:54.534
It's too steep
and I'm freaking
out up here!

18:54.567 --> 18:56.436
Honey, honey, relax, okay?

18:56.469 --> 18:57.737
I'm just joking.

18:57.770 --> 18:59.138
I'm actually
really surprised

18:59.172 --> 19:01.040
you even made it
to the top.

19:01.073 --> 19:02.309
Okay, I'm proud of you.

19:03.543 --> 19:06.045
Babe, I love you.
I'll help you down.

19:06.078 --> 19:07.113
Okay? Give me a kiss.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.348
That I can do.

19:10.683 --> 19:12.051
(Shouting)
Anja?

19:12.084 --> 19:13.152
Anja!

19:17.957 --> 19:18.958
Oh, God.

19:30.370 --> 19:45.285
(Music)

19:56.729 --> 19:58.565
What do you say,
Gustaf's Dog?

19:58.598 --> 19:59.832
Gustaf's Dog?

20:01.234 --> 20:03.370
Gustaf's Dog!

20:03.403 --> 20:05.171
What have you done?

20:05.204 --> 20:06.673
On the Persian rug?

20:06.706 --> 20:09.409
I mean, it's just
like walking on snow.

20:09.442 --> 20:10.877
You know?
It's not a sport.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.945
There's no ball.

20:12.979 --> 20:14.314
Sport has to
have a ball.

20:15.682 --> 20:16.749
So what is it
that you do?

20:16.783 --> 20:18.951
Uh, I'm a
professional skier.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.422
Hm.

20:22.455 --> 20:25.358
Yeah, sometimes I
speak before I think.

20:25.392 --> 20:26.959
There you are.

20:26.993 --> 20:28.060
Oh, hey!
Hi.

20:28.094 --> 20:30.029
Hi. Oh, you got
stuff...
Not funny.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.063
No, no...
Not funny.

20:36.669 --> 20:38.104
Bruce:
Honey, you have
something on the
side of your face...

20:38.137 --> 20:39.205
Stop it, please.
It's for real this time.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.172
Not now!

20:52.719 --> 20:53.820
Bruce:
Honey, you
have something.

20:53.853 --> 20:54.821
Not now, okay?
I'm not...

21:07.400 --> 21:09.235
(Laughing)

21:09.268 --> 21:11.338
Oh my God, what
a sore loser she is.

21:11.371 --> 21:12.939
Honey, you have
stuff all over...

21:12.972 --> 21:14.140
It's not funny,
okay?
It's all over
your f...

21:14.173 --> 21:16.042
Come on.
Okay, fine,
do it yourself.

21:16.075 --> 21:17.544
Just... touch
it yourself.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.147
Oh, my God.

21:21.180 --> 21:23.416
I have snot
all over my face.
I...

21:23.450 --> 21:25.084
Bruce, why didn't
you tell me?
(Pounding table)

21:25.117 --> 21:26.953
I tried to tell you,
like, ten times.
Now Anja thinks

21:26.986 --> 21:30.357
I'm some
super competitive,
nagging snot-face!

21:31.758 --> 21:34.561
Is there any part of that
that's not true?

21:34.594 --> 21:35.828
It's not funny.

21:35.862 --> 21:37.764
Snot funny.

21:37.797 --> 21:40.199
God.
Snot the end
of the world.

21:44.904 --> 21:47.206
This is the deal,
Gustaf's Dog.

21:47.239 --> 21:48.641
You poop too much.

21:48.675 --> 21:50.443
I told you this before...

21:52.311 --> 21:55.348
and it's either my way
or the highway.

21:55.382 --> 21:57.149
So, I'm sorry to say

21:57.183 --> 21:59.419
you're no longer
Gustaf's Dog.

21:59.452 --> 22:00.820
You're just dog.

22:02.054 --> 22:03.890
Run, dog.

22:03.923 --> 22:05.291
Run free.

22:07.026 --> 22:08.995
Man:

22:17.470 --> 22:20.373
* We're not living in America
