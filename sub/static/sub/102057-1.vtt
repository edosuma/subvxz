00:02.203 --> 00:05.373
(TV static crackling)

00:11.179 --> 00:14.215
(eerie tense music)

00:18.452 --> 00:23.457
- [Kathy] I know, I haven't got
a script, is this my camera?

00:24.092 --> 00:24.925
Okay, okay.

00:26.960 --> 00:29.930
Hello, Kathy Perkin
reporting live,

00:29.930 --> 00:32.100
now we're having technical
problems here, please stand by.

00:32.133 --> 00:34.968
Hello, we seem to
have lost picture,

00:35.002 --> 00:38.172
Dennis is pic, Dennis
is picture up yet?

00:38.172 --> 00:41.575
Okay, no picture,
no picture, okay.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.712
Okay, yes I can see it.

00:44.712 --> 00:46.347
Okay, yes I can see it.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.417
Still no picture,
still not picture?

00:50.651 --> 00:51.452
Okay.

00:55.989 --> 00:57.758
Hello, this is Kathy Perkin

00:57.758 --> 01:01.095
with Channel 13's
special news report.

01:01.129 --> 01:02.596
We're having some
technical problems

01:02.596 --> 01:05.599
and some of you may
only be receiving audio.

01:05.633 --> 01:06.600
I will continue.

01:08.035 --> 01:10.471
We have reports coming in
from all around the world

01:10.504 --> 01:12.206
that we are under attack.

01:12.206 --> 01:14.842
I repeat, we are under attack.

01:14.842 --> 01:17.077
Please get to cover,
get to a safe place,

01:17.111 --> 01:20.348
please, I repeat,
we are under attack.

01:20.381 --> 01:22.082
- It's just an
incredible situation.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.584
There's never been
anything like this.

01:23.584 --> 01:26.920
- All over the world, we're
seeing the devastating impact.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.757
(speaking French)

01:35.329 --> 01:38.499
- I want as few lives
lost as possible.

01:38.532 --> 01:43.237
- Inside and keep it right
here for the very latest.

01:43.304 --> 01:46.140
(speaking French)

01:49.076 --> 01:50.578
- But this country is not alone.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.513
- [Reporter] Prague
invoking war,

01:52.546 --> 01:55.783
ordering people to stay
home for at least 15 days

01:55.783 --> 01:58.452
except for essential activities
such as grocery shopping

01:58.486 --> 02:00.221
or outdoor exercise.

02:00.254 --> 02:01.655
- There'll be death.

02:01.655 --> 02:03.257
- [Reporter] This
is about borders,

02:03.257 --> 02:05.058
Germany brought
in fresh controls

02:05.092 --> 02:07.328
this morning, dividing
the continent.

02:07.328 --> 02:10.130
- [Reporter] It's now going
to turn towards the fight

02:10.130 --> 02:11.332
against this epidemic.

02:11.365 --> 02:13.834
- They hit you like
you got hit by a club.

02:15.703 --> 02:18.372
(ominous music)

02:24.212 --> 02:27.715
(tense reflective music)

03:31.245 --> 03:33.947
(dramatic music)

04:53.293 --> 04:55.796
(tense music)

05:02.035 --> 05:05.406
(tense electronic music)

05:18.318 --> 05:20.588
(coughing)

05:29.329 --> 05:32.666
(creature snarling)

05:32.666 --> 05:36.169
(tense electronic music)

06:56.283 --> 07:01.154
(eerie music)
(snarling)

07:11.932 --> 07:16.670
(growling)
(screaming)

07:30.383 --> 07:33.053
(phone ringing)

07:39.960 --> 07:41.328
(growls)
(shouts)

07:41.328 --> 07:44.698
- You're gonna
need a bigger boat.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.266
- What?

07:46.266 --> 07:47.167
- You know?

07:48.201 --> 07:49.402
- What?

07:49.469 --> 07:51.639
- [Cooper] Come
on you must know.

07:51.639 --> 07:54.307
- I mean, I can just
see a shark mask.

07:54.307 --> 07:57.578
- Highest grossing film in 1975?

07:57.578 --> 07:58.912
- I was born in the 90s.

08:00.413 --> 08:02.883
- Hang on, this might
help you get it.

08:02.883 --> 08:05.919
(imitating "Jaws" theme)

08:05.953 --> 08:07.921
- I don't know what that is.

08:07.921 --> 08:12.926
- It's "Jaws", everyone on
the planet knows "Jaws".

08:14.094 --> 08:14.995
- I don't really know
what you're doing,

08:14.995 --> 08:16.630
is it an initiation thing?

08:16.630 --> 08:18.666
You know, first day
on the job and stuff?

08:20.333 --> 08:23.170
- No, it's 'cause
you've got the same name

08:23.203 --> 08:24.672
as Roy Scheider character.

08:24.672 --> 08:26.674
Master cinema survivor?

08:26.674 --> 08:28.709
Only one to survive
the shark attacks,

08:28.742 --> 08:30.744
he blew it to smithereens.

08:30.778 --> 08:33.180
- Oh, did he, okay.

08:33.213 --> 08:37.951
- Oh come on, your name's
Brody, same as Scheider's.

08:39.419 --> 08:42.122
Oh I can see you're gonna be
a barrel of laughs, ain't ya?

08:42.122 --> 08:43.390
Well come on, what did you do

08:43.423 --> 08:45.225
to get lumbered in
a place like this?

08:45.225 --> 08:47.427
- No nothing, I mean there
was a small incident.

08:47.460 --> 08:48.962
- Tell ya what, don't worry.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.864
Grab ya coat, I'll give
you the guided tour

08:50.931 --> 08:52.666
of Little Pitchfield.

08:58.338 --> 09:01.408
By the way son, what
is your first name?

09:01.408 --> 09:02.843
- Oh, do you really wanna know?

09:02.843 --> 09:05.212
- Well yeah, I wouldn't
have asked otherwise.

09:05.245 --> 09:07.414
Around here, we're all
on first name terms.

09:08.415 --> 09:09.750
- It's Bruce.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.785
- (laughing) Bruce?

09:13.987 --> 09:15.455
- What?

09:15.455 --> 09:17.925
- Name of the shark in the
film, it was Bruce (laughing).

09:20.293 --> 09:21.128
- Was it really?

09:22.963 --> 09:25.365
I thought I was
named after my uncle.

09:25.432 --> 09:27.300
Police Sergeant Cooper?

09:29.036 --> 09:31.905
(Cooper Laughing)

09:33.406 --> 09:35.876
Police Sergeant Cooper.

09:35.876 --> 09:37.277
- Starsky.

09:37.344 --> 09:38.245
- What?

09:38.245 --> 09:40.113
- My first name, Starsky.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.082
- Starsky?

09:42.082 --> 09:44.551
- Yeah, apparently
I was conceived

09:44.551 --> 09:46.319
during the very first episode.

09:46.386 --> 09:49.422
Good old Mum and Dad,
God rest their souls.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.158
They loved that show.

09:51.224 --> 09:52.425
- Oh what show?

09:52.425 --> 09:54.261
- Only the greatest cop
show ever seen on TV.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.197
- I don't know it.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.801
- "Starsky and Hutch"?

10:00.801 --> 10:02.803
First aired in 1975.

10:02.836 --> 10:05.505
- I was born in
the 90s, remember?

10:05.505 --> 10:06.640
Sorry.

10:06.674 --> 10:07.841
- It was awesome.

10:07.841 --> 10:10.844
I mean, they had
girls, guns, oh cars!

10:10.844 --> 10:12.345
What more could you
want from a show?

10:12.345 --> 10:16.183
I mean they had this Ford
Grand Torino painted red

10:16.216 --> 10:19.486
and it had this fantastic white
stripe down the side of it.

10:19.486 --> 10:20.654
It was awesome.

10:20.721 --> 10:24.457
- Well I'll have to look
it up then, Starsky.

10:24.457 --> 10:27.795
- No, Starsky.

10:27.795 --> 10:29.162
- Yeah?

10:29.196 --> 10:30.463
- You fell for the
oldest trick in the book,

10:30.463 --> 10:31.932
the old fake name joke.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.533
It's not Starsky, it's Shaun.

10:35.135 --> 10:38.305
Oh you are gonna be a
barrel of laughs aren't you?

10:38.338 --> 10:39.572
We're gonna wind you up rotten.

10:39.572 --> 10:40.708
Come on, son.

10:40.708 --> 10:43.010
(laughing)

10:44.377 --> 10:47.080
(dramatic music)

10:58.726 --> 11:01.695
- This place must have been
beautiful in its heyday.

11:01.762 --> 11:05.265
- I think it was an old hospital
for the criminally insane.

11:05.265 --> 11:07.667
- You'd have fitted
in perfectly then.

11:07.667 --> 11:08.501
- You think?

11:09.669 --> 11:14.341
- Yes, you're a rogue,
a cad, a bandit.

11:15.709 --> 11:17.745
- English lit is
your thing then.

11:17.778 --> 11:20.180
Anyway, I thought
women love a rogue.

11:20.213 --> 11:21.882
- Not if the man's a prick.

11:27.420 --> 11:30.758
I just wish we could
explore this place.

11:31.759 --> 11:32.592
- Come on then.

11:32.592 --> 11:33.761
- We shouldn't.

11:33.794 --> 11:34.995
- Why not?

11:34.995 --> 11:38.098
- Someone could be in
there and then what?

11:38.131 --> 11:41.234
- There's nobody around,
the place is abandoned.

11:41.234 --> 11:43.236
People 'round here
are backwards.

11:43.236 --> 11:45.572
Come on, it's like
going back in time.

11:48.375 --> 11:49.910
And they never locked the doors.

11:52.712 --> 11:55.783
- All right but I'm not
having sex with you,

11:55.783 --> 11:57.250
if that's your caddish plan.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.051
- Come on.

12:01.421 --> 12:04.424
(eerie tense music)

12:07.427 --> 12:10.163
(sheep bleating)

12:16.036 --> 12:18.638
(dog barking)

12:23.543 --> 12:25.545
- Definitely not like London.

12:25.578 --> 12:26.579
Phone booths work.

12:34.387 --> 12:35.622
(bells tolling)

12:35.622 --> 12:39.259
- There she is, in all
her glory, the church.

12:40.593 --> 12:43.130
Even the vicar only
had one follower

12:43.130 --> 12:45.198
and that was his cleaner.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.200
Come on Bruce, let's go

12:47.200 --> 12:50.170
and see if we can drum
up a generation gap.

12:57.077 --> 12:59.246
(laughing)

12:59.246 --> 13:00.747
- Are you always this comical?

13:00.747 --> 13:02.682
I thought that on this
job you have to be,

13:02.715 --> 13:04.717
you have to be
vigilant all the time.

13:04.717 --> 13:06.119
- Vigilant?

13:06.153 --> 13:08.155
You'll soon find out
nothing happens 'round here.

13:08.221 --> 13:10.723
- Well, my training
taught me to be prepared

13:10.757 --> 13:13.126
for anything and
everything at any time,

13:13.126 --> 13:14.928
day or night, on duty or off.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.465
- Well, I tell you something
they aint prepared you for.

13:18.465 --> 13:19.366
- What's that?

13:19.432 --> 13:21.234
- Boredom, sheer boredom.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.502
Nothing happens 'round here.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.838
It's like a morgue
in a recession.

13:24.838 --> 13:26.673
- Well, then maybe
we need to go out

13:26.673 --> 13:27.574
and find crime, you know,

13:27.640 --> 13:29.042
I mean it happens it everywhere.

13:29.042 --> 13:31.044
They say it's just hidden
behind closed doors.

13:31.078 --> 13:34.882
- I used to be just like you
when I first started, keen.

13:34.882 --> 13:36.216
- And how long ago was that?

13:36.249 --> 13:38.285
If you don't mind me asking.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.819
- 25 years.

13:39.887 --> 13:41.588
Actually, I've been
in Little Pitchfield

13:41.588 --> 13:44.657
for 24 and half
now and this is it.

13:45.859 --> 13:47.127
Rush hour.

13:47.127 --> 13:48.195
(laughs)

13:48.261 --> 13:49.863
I know everybody 'round here,

13:49.863 --> 13:51.364
all their ins and their outs

13:51.431 --> 13:52.966
and all their dirty laundry

13:52.966 --> 13:56.003
and believe me, Mrs.
Broomfield at the vicarage

13:56.036 --> 13:57.370
she's got some very
dirty underwear.

13:57.404 --> 13:58.638
- Right, okay, yeah.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.974
A bit sexist that, isn't it?

14:00.974 --> 14:01.909
- Sexist?

14:01.909 --> 14:02.910
No.

14:02.943 --> 14:05.212
That's why you're P.C. Brody,

14:05.212 --> 14:07.347
stop being so PC, Bruce.

14:08.548 --> 14:10.117
- Well government
guidelines suggest

14:10.183 --> 14:11.418
that we should
actually investigate

14:11.418 --> 14:13.453
all hate crime initiators, so.

14:14.554 --> 14:15.923
- It's like living in the past.

14:15.923 --> 14:18.325
No one cares about
political connectiveness.

14:18.391 --> 14:20.660
They just go about
their lives as normal.

14:20.660 --> 14:24.497
Same old boring thing
day after day after day.

14:24.497 --> 14:25.832
- There's must be some crime.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.201
Otherwise that would
mean Little Pitchfield

14:28.235 --> 14:30.170
is literally a
crime free location.

14:30.170 --> 14:31.638
- Let me tell you something.

14:31.671 --> 14:34.241
Little Pitchfield has been
off every crime report

14:34.241 --> 14:37.177
and statistic in
the last 17 years.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.012
No, no really, really.

14:39.012 --> 14:40.613
I read about it somewhere.

14:40.613 --> 14:45.618
Something about us making
the good cops look bad.

14:46.486 --> 14:48.255
So they just leave us off now.

14:48.255 --> 14:49.256
- Hang on.

14:49.256 --> 14:50.657
- Brody, wait!

14:54.294 --> 14:55.795
- Excuse me, sir.

14:55.828 --> 14:57.164
You do realise that
public urination

14:57.164 --> 14:59.967
is a offence under the
Public Order Act of 1986

14:59.967 --> 15:02.970
and as such that can be
considered indecent exposure.

15:03.003 --> 15:04.671
- Nicely said, son.

15:04.671 --> 15:05.505
There's no crime here.

15:05.505 --> 15:06.906
Billy.

15:06.974 --> 15:08.875
What have I told you
about peeing up that tree?

15:08.875 --> 15:09.709
- Sorry, Shaun.

15:09.709 --> 15:10.577
- Go on, son.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.345
Go about your business.

15:12.379 --> 15:14.614
(laughing)

15:17.517 --> 15:19.652
- What you do that for?

15:19.719 --> 15:21.788
That, that's an offence.

15:21.788 --> 15:23.323
Public urination.

15:24.291 --> 15:25.292
- Look around.

15:25.325 --> 15:26.859
What public?

15:26.926 --> 15:29.696
Anyway, he always gets it wrong.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.267
- So hang on wrong?

15:34.301 --> 15:36.169
- Yeah, he's peeing
up the wrong tree.

15:37.570 --> 15:38.838
- What?

15:38.838 --> 15:42.409
- Yeah, the peeing tree
is four down on the left

15:42.475 --> 15:45.278
but he's a bit thick in the
head, bit of a simpleton.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.446
- The government
guidelines suggest we call

15:46.513 --> 15:48.681
that a disability, actually.

15:48.715 --> 15:49.882
- Disability?

15:49.882 --> 15:53.220
He just doesn't know
his left from his right.

15:57.257 --> 15:59.259
- Do you do anything
by the book?

15:59.259 --> 16:00.793
- All depends what book it is.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.264
- The Police Handbook,
the guidelines.

16:04.264 --> 16:08.235
- Ah, there it is,
the bloody guidelines.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.837
Let me tell you something
about the guidelines,

16:10.837 --> 16:12.039
they're only put
there 'cause someone

16:12.072 --> 16:13.873
can't make a decision
between what's right

16:13.873 --> 16:15.042
and what's wrong.

16:15.042 --> 16:16.209
Ah, ah, ah.

16:16.209 --> 16:18.111
Until it's no
longer a guideline.

16:18.178 --> 16:20.180
See, I can do whatever
I want when I want

16:20.180 --> 16:24.417
because 'round here,
I'm the boss, number one

16:24.417 --> 16:26.419
and if you think
some snotty nose,

16:26.419 --> 16:28.588
pencil pushing
guideline and your PC

16:28.588 --> 16:29.822
is gonna come into
my neck of the woods

16:29.889 --> 16:32.059
and tell me what to
do, well then you've

16:32.059 --> 16:33.760
got another thing coming.

16:33.793 --> 16:35.462
Well do you get me?

16:35.462 --> 16:36.329
- Yes, sir.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.665
- Well do ya, punk?

16:38.665 --> 16:40.467
- Yes, sir.

16:40.467 --> 16:41.468
- (laughs) Did you get it?

16:41.468 --> 16:43.803
Clint Eastwood, Dirty Harry.

16:44.971 --> 16:47.307
- Yeah, I think
I've seen that one.

16:47.307 --> 16:48.708
- See, can you
imagine what it's like

16:48.708 --> 16:50.377
to be Detective Callahan?

16:50.410 --> 16:51.711
Chasing down suspects,
hunting them down

16:52.879 --> 16:54.081
and shooting the bastards.

16:54.081 --> 16:55.082
(mimics gunshot)

16:55.082 --> 16:56.916
(laughs)

16:56.949 --> 16:58.451
That was my dream.

17:05.325 --> 17:06.659
- 17 years.

17:06.693 --> 17:07.527
- Huh?

17:09.962 --> 17:12.165
- You said that statistically
Little Pitchfield

17:12.165 --> 17:14.501
has been off the police
records for 17 years,

17:14.534 --> 17:17.537
so what happened 17 years ago?

17:17.570 --> 17:20.240
- Now that, my boy,
is another story.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.675
- So, what happened?

17:22.675 --> 17:24.911
- Well, the villagers
said it was some sort

17:24.944 --> 17:26.746
of alien invasion.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.916
- Right, okay another
one of your jokes.

17:29.949 --> 17:31.050
- No, no, no, no.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.285
This is no joke.

17:32.319 --> 17:34.321
It was the last time
anything interesting

17:34.321 --> 17:35.488
happened around here.

17:35.555 --> 17:36.989
See, it was Guy Fawkes night.

17:36.989 --> 17:39.792
We could see the fireworks
off into the distance.

17:40.827 --> 17:41.994
Did I tell you we haven't

17:42.028 --> 17:43.530
got a fireworks
display around here?

17:43.596 --> 17:45.165
Just haven't got enough people.

17:45.165 --> 17:47.700
Anyway, we could see
it in Great Pitchfield

17:47.767 --> 17:49.302
about three miles away.

17:49.336 --> 17:50.470
I mean, it was a
really clear night

17:50.470 --> 17:52.172
and I remember
because there was me,

17:52.172 --> 17:55.742
Billy, Drake, Bob,
Sandra, Ellen,

17:56.709 --> 17:58.445
Sally and Bernard.

17:58.511 --> 17:59.779
Yeah, Bernard.

17:59.779 --> 18:01.914
See now, Bernard was
trying to hump Sally

18:01.914 --> 18:03.750
all night long,
right in front of us.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.218
We kept telling
him to leave it out

18:05.218 --> 18:07.987
but he just humped away to
his heart's content all night.

18:08.054 --> 18:10.490
In fact, I think he even
missed the fireworks.

18:10.490 --> 18:13.626
- Sorry, Bernard is?

18:13.626 --> 18:16.963
- Bernard's an afghan hound
and Sally's a shih tzu.

18:16.963 --> 18:18.831
Hang on, hang on.

18:18.865 --> 18:19.832
You thought they was?

18:19.832 --> 18:22.001
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:22.001 --> 18:23.170
- No.

18:23.170 --> 18:25.138
Anyway, where was I?

18:27.340 --> 18:28.341
- Fireworks.

18:28.341 --> 18:29.842
- Oh yeah, yeah, the fireworks.

18:29.842 --> 18:32.179
Listen, Sandra and Bob were
looking out into the distance

18:32.179 --> 18:34.847
and to the left of the
fireworks, Bob could see

18:34.881 --> 18:36.849
this bright white light.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.786
Well he did point it out
to me, come to think of it,

18:39.819 --> 18:41.288
but I just dismissed it.

18:41.288 --> 18:42.955
I thought it was just,
you know, other fireworks.

18:42.989 --> 18:44.591
But anyway, listen,
all of a sudden

18:44.591 --> 18:46.058
there was a power surge.

18:46.092 --> 18:48.161
The whole village went
out and back on again.

18:48.161 --> 18:50.197
Well, Sally and
Bernard stopped humping

18:50.263 --> 18:51.464
and started howling.

18:51.464 --> 18:52.765
That made me look
across the field

18:52.799 --> 18:55.302
and there was this
bright white light.

18:55.302 --> 18:58.037
We could all see it, this one,

18:58.070 --> 19:02.242
and all of a sudden it
just and it was gone

19:02.242 --> 19:05.412
but in a completely different
direction to the fireworks.

19:07.714 --> 19:09.949
- You know, I mean, those lights

19:10.016 --> 19:12.084
could have been anything, right?

19:12.084 --> 19:13.386
- Yeah, maybe.

19:13.420 --> 19:14.887
Guess we'll never know now.

19:14.887 --> 19:17.890
(eerie tense music)

19:51.123 --> 19:55.962
(electrical crackling)
(screaming)

19:55.962 --> 19:57.297
Other strange things
happened that night.

19:57.330 --> 19:59.532
It was, everyone
had something stolen

19:59.599 --> 20:01.167
from properties, you know.

20:01.167 --> 20:02.369
I mean, Hanson reported it

20:02.402 --> 20:04.337
but everyone got
something stolen.

20:04.337 --> 20:08.174
Never did catch the bastards
that stole my scooter.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.609
- Uh, scooter?

20:09.676 --> 20:10.743
- Yeah, yeah you know.

20:11.678 --> 20:13.012
- Oh like a moped.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.247
Yeah.
- Oi, oi, oi.

20:14.247 --> 20:17.450
Don't ever call a
scooter a moped.

20:17.517 --> 20:18.951
I'll give you a slap next time.

20:18.951 --> 20:22.889
Anyway, there was one good
thing come out of that night.

20:22.922 --> 20:27.594
See, Sally had the
strangest puppies

20:27.594 --> 20:28.595
that you'd ever seen.

20:36.469 --> 20:37.870
- Puppies, right.

20:46.446 --> 20:49.048
- See, told you
this place was okay.

20:50.883 --> 20:51.651
- I guess.

20:54.921 --> 20:57.256
It's both a beautiful
and a really sad place.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.058
- Sad?

21:00.627 --> 21:02.795
- Looking at it
now, I can imagine

21:02.829 --> 21:04.297
what it once might have been

21:05.765 --> 21:09.536
but then all those years
of neglect and loneliness.

21:11.338 --> 21:13.840
It must have been amazing
when it was full of life.

21:16.909 --> 21:18.778
Now, it just looks
like my grandma,

21:18.845 --> 21:19.912
just hanging in there.

21:21.047 --> 21:22.549
- You do have a way with words.

21:24.050 --> 21:26.486
I could see you becoming
a great novelist one day.

21:28.721 --> 21:30.056
- Yeah?

21:30.089 --> 21:31.991
What sort of books
would I write?

21:33.626 --> 21:34.961
- Romantic ones for sure.

21:35.862 --> 21:37.029
- Really?

21:37.096 --> 21:39.332
You see me as a Mills
& Boons novelist?

21:39.332 --> 21:40.166
- Possibly.

21:41.468 --> 21:43.135
- Am I a graphic novelist?

21:44.203 --> 21:45.705
- I doubt that.

21:45.738 --> 21:48.908
I saw you when Catherine got
that nosebleed last year.

21:48.975 --> 21:50.910
You were hysterical.

21:50.910 --> 21:52.244
- You saw that?

21:52.278 --> 21:53.346
- Uh huh.

21:53.380 --> 21:55.548
She was bawling her eyes out.

21:55.548 --> 21:57.950
- And so the male brain
gets it wrong yet again.

21:57.950 --> 21:59.251
- Hmm?

21:59.251 --> 22:01.621
- I wasn't hysterical
because of the blood.

22:01.654 --> 22:04.123
I was upset for my friend.

22:04.123 --> 22:06.593
She had a date that
night and she got blood

22:06.593 --> 22:07.594
all down her blouse.

22:08.795 --> 22:10.497
It was the one she was
gonna wear on the date.

22:11.798 --> 22:13.600
- I see, okay, so.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.702
It could be graphic novels.

22:17.303 --> 22:19.806
All I know is you've
got a pretty mind.

22:21.674 --> 22:22.675
- Pretty mind?

22:23.910 --> 22:25.912
That could almost be
considered flirting.

22:28.014 --> 22:29.582
- Men don't flirt.

22:29.582 --> 22:33.453
- No, they don't, I agree.

22:33.486 --> 22:35.555
They make it too obvious.

22:37.289 --> 22:38.791
I know exactly why
you've brought me here

22:38.825 --> 22:39.726
and what you want.

22:40.993 --> 22:42.795
- And why is that?

22:42.795 --> 22:44.497
- The question isn't why.

22:44.531 --> 22:46.866
The question is answered
just by my being here.

22:49.368 --> 22:52.204
(woman screaming in distance)

22:52.238 --> 22:53.740
What was that?

22:53.740 --> 22:55.742
- Yeah, I heard that.

22:55.742 --> 22:57.109
- Listen.

22:57.176 --> 22:58.210
(woman sobbing)

22:58.210 --> 22:59.846
- Sounds like crying.

22:59.879 --> 23:02.281
Like a woman crying.

23:02.281 --> 23:04.083
- We should leave.

23:04.083 --> 23:07.720
- No, I want to
see what that is.

23:07.754 --> 23:10.757
(eerie tense music)

23:16.629 --> 23:18.130
- I don't like this.

23:18.130 --> 23:21.133
(ethereal roaring)

23:21.133 --> 23:23.970
That sounded like death itself.

23:24.003 --> 23:27.306
- Whatever it is it sounds
weird and pissed off.

23:27.339 --> 23:29.241
- I think we should leave.

23:29.241 --> 23:32.078
- No, I need to
know what that is.

23:34.046 --> 23:36.916
(ethereal roaring)

23:38.951 --> 23:40.086
- What is it?

23:40.086 --> 23:41.320
- Don't come up here.

23:43.790 --> 23:45.257
- What is it?

23:45.257 --> 23:48.260
(eerie tense music)

23:51.664 --> 23:54.534
(ethereal roaring)

23:57.504 --> 23:58.304
Dan?

24:00.006 --> 24:00.807
Dan.

24:03.009 --> 24:04.010
Dan!

24:04.010 --> 24:05.512
- What?

24:05.545 --> 24:07.780
- Something is watching us.

24:08.915 --> 24:11.918
(eerie tense music)

24:12.885 --> 24:14.887
(wet crunching)

24:14.921 --> 24:15.955
What is that?

24:17.089 --> 24:18.257
- [Dan] I have no idea.

24:19.792 --> 24:20.627
- What do we do?

24:24.631 --> 24:26.933
- Run.

24:26.966 --> 24:27.800
Run.

24:29.301 --> 24:30.336
Run!

24:30.336 --> 24:34.173
(energetic eerie tense music)

24:42.949 --> 24:47.954
(wet crunching)
(Dan screaming)

24:48.420 --> 24:50.089
(gasps)

24:52.759 --> 24:55.762
(eerie tense music)

25:02.501 --> 25:03.670
- Bloody kids.

25:33.465 --> 25:34.934
(alarm ringing)

25:34.934 --> 25:35.735
- Fuck.

25:40.873 --> 25:43.375
(tense music)

25:58.124 --> 26:00.459
- So what we got here, then?

26:02.294 --> 26:04.163
- I can't believe you've
never heard of the film Jaws.

26:04.163 --> 26:06.465
It was a Spielberg masterpiece.

26:06.465 --> 26:08.835
Do you know it took 159
days to make that film

26:08.868 --> 26:10.903
'cause the shark
just wouldn't work.

26:10.970 --> 26:12.639
What films you into, anyway?

26:12.672 --> 26:15.541
- [Radio] Calling PS Cooper,
PS Cooper, are you there?

26:15.541 --> 26:16.709
- Yeah, receiving, over.

26:16.743 --> 26:17.677
- [Radio] Breaking
and entering reported

26:17.710 --> 26:19.211
at Little Pitchfield Manor.

26:19.211 --> 26:21.714
Suspects on site,
I see one male,

26:21.714 --> 26:22.715
and I see one female.

26:22.749 --> 26:25.284
Also reports of IC9 in location.

26:25.317 --> 26:27.253
- Yeah, on route.

26:27.253 --> 26:28.254
What's on IC9?

26:28.254 --> 26:29.255
- IC9 is unknown.

26:29.288 --> 26:30.489
- Oh right.

26:30.556 --> 26:31.457
- Where's Little
Pitchfield Manor?

26:31.457 --> 26:32.158
- Just 'round the corner.

26:32.224 --> 26:32.959
- There?
- Yeah.

26:32.959 --> 26:33.793
- Come on.

26:35.294 --> 26:40.299
(alarm ringing)
(tense music)

26:44.336 --> 26:46.372
- Oi, what are you doing?

26:47.640 --> 26:49.575
- I'm going in.

26:49.575 --> 26:51.010
- No, hang on.

26:51.043 --> 26:54.213
I've got to get my
breath back, first.

26:56.916 --> 26:59.085
- Are we going in or not?

26:59.118 --> 27:00.486
- Hang on.

27:00.552 --> 27:04.056
Jesus, you scared
the shit out of me.

27:04.090 --> 27:05.324
- I just got here.

27:05.324 --> 27:06.826
Got scared, didn't
want to go inside

27:06.859 --> 27:08.761
in case there are
dangerous criminals.

27:09.662 --> 27:11.297
- (mumbles) 'round here.

27:11.297 --> 27:15.334
Anyway, you would of scared
them all away, Ellen.

27:17.236 --> 27:20.639
(tense electronic music)

27:25.945 --> 27:27.279
- It should be okay, now.

27:27.279 --> 27:29.581
Bob has them cornered
in the library.

27:29.581 --> 27:30.582
Come on.

27:42.128 --> 27:43.529
- Hang on.

27:43.529 --> 27:48.534
(alarm ringing)
(tense electronic music)

27:53.672 --> 27:55.341
- Where'd you say they was?

27:55.341 --> 27:56.408
- Library.

27:56.475 --> 27:57.576
- Excuse me, sorry.

27:57.576 --> 27:59.011
Madam, thank you.

28:10.422 --> 28:11.657
- I've got 'em.

28:11.724 --> 28:13.525
I've kept them safe.

28:13.525 --> 28:14.994
They're not gonna go anywhere.

28:14.994 --> 28:16.262
You can count on me.

28:17.163 --> 28:18.530
You can always count on me.

28:18.597 --> 28:20.099
- Nice work, Bob.

28:20.099 --> 28:21.333
- Sir, if you could just put
that weapon down for me, sir.

28:21.333 --> 28:22.334
- Shaun, Shaun.
- Sir, sir.

28:22.334 --> 28:24.136
- It's all right, it's okay.

28:24.170 --> 28:26.005
- I think it's outrageous that
you come onto my property.

28:26.005 --> 28:29.008
- I'll take it from here, Ellen.

28:31.243 --> 28:33.679
Now, I don't recognise yous two.

28:33.712 --> 28:34.613
Names.

28:34.613 --> 28:35.848
- I'm Dan, this is Katie.

28:35.882 --> 28:37.784
- Ah Great Pitchfield
by the looks of em,

28:37.784 --> 28:39.285
I would say.

28:39.285 --> 28:42.054
- Yeah, look like a couple
of wrongens to me, as well.

28:42.088 --> 28:42.922
- [Dan] Did you see it?

28:42.922 --> 28:43.823
- See what?

28:43.823 --> 28:44.957
- The thing in the woods.

28:44.957 --> 28:45.958
- It was chasing us.

28:47.193 --> 28:49.328
- Oh, funny.

28:49.328 --> 28:50.596
Very funny.

28:50.629 --> 28:52.765
Bob is this, Ellen did
you put him up to this?

28:52.765 --> 28:54.600
Is this someones
birthday or something?

28:54.600 --> 28:56.402
- This deadly serious.

28:56.402 --> 28:58.070
- This is fucking serious.

28:58.070 --> 28:59.171
- Excuse me, sir.

28:59.171 --> 29:00.539
Have you or Katie found yourself

29:00.572 --> 29:03.075
taking any illegal
substances today?

29:03.142 --> 29:04.043
- [Dan] No.

29:04.043 --> 29:04.844
- Have you checked the grounds?

29:04.877 --> 29:05.778
It was chasing it.

29:05.778 --> 29:07.279
It attacked Dan.

29:07.279 --> 29:09.715
- This is pathetic.

29:09.715 --> 29:11.117
What attacked you?

29:11.183 --> 29:12.284
- Some thing.

29:12.284 --> 29:13.452
We heard it.

29:13.485 --> 29:15.087
Yeah, we were on the
grounds, we admit that.

29:16.088 --> 29:17.924
We heard a noise in the woods,

29:17.924 --> 29:19.258
we went to investigate it.

29:19.258 --> 29:20.492
- Oh, you don't do that.

29:20.526 --> 29:21.760
- [Dan] What?

29:21.794 --> 29:23.029
- Well, if you've ever
seen any horror film

29:23.029 --> 29:26.498
you know you never
ever investigate.

29:26.498 --> 29:30.803
You get our ass cheeks out
there as soon as possible.

29:30.837 --> 29:32.171
- I agree with Bob.

29:32.171 --> 29:34.340
- Can we please
stick to the facts?

29:35.474 --> 29:36.542
Tell me what happened.

29:37.443 --> 29:40.947
- Uh, well it was,

29:42.348 --> 29:45.184
it was, it was like.

29:46.085 --> 29:47.386
It was like.

29:48.287 --> 29:49.588
- You need to tell them.

29:49.588 --> 29:50.957
- They won't believe us.

29:50.990 --> 29:52.558
- Try us.

29:52.591 --> 29:53.759
- Okay.

29:55.294 --> 29:56.462
It looked like a zombie.

29:58.865 --> 30:01.000
- Oh that wee Billy.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.668
- Probably.

30:02.668 --> 30:05.171
- I think, I think what
they're referring to

30:05.171 --> 30:08.007
is the IC9 reported
to be in the vicinity.

30:08.040 --> 30:10.376
- IC9, is that police
code for zombie?

30:10.376 --> 30:11.510
- No.

30:11.543 --> 30:13.079
It means unknown.

30:13.079 --> 30:15.781
- What I think this is, sir,

30:15.848 --> 30:18.350
is a clearly a case
of mistaken identity.

30:18.384 --> 30:20.286
- We were chased by this thing.

30:20.286 --> 30:21.787
- Are you in charge here?

30:21.820 --> 30:23.322
- [Cooper] And what makes
you say that, little lady?

30:23.389 --> 30:24.823
- You are Police
Sergeant Cooper.

30:24.823 --> 30:26.125
- Oh, you've heard
of me, have you?

30:26.125 --> 30:28.260
- Yeah, my uncle works
in traffic police

30:28.294 --> 30:30.796
and we've heard of you and
this shitty little hamlet.

30:30.796 --> 30:33.099
In Great Pitchfield,
you were voted

30:33.099 --> 30:35.667
the most incompetent sergeant
in the whole district.

30:37.703 --> 30:39.005
- Go that far?

30:39.005 --> 30:40.672
- You need to know
what we understand

30:40.672 --> 30:42.174
what we witnessed here.

30:42.174 --> 30:43.409
- I think you need to
tell us what is going on.

30:43.475 --> 30:45.711
You need to describe
the individual for us.

30:45.711 --> 30:49.115
- Person, they were lying down.

30:49.181 --> 30:51.350
Put it this way, all
their insides, yeah,

30:51.350 --> 30:52.818
they were on the outside.

30:52.885 --> 30:55.821
- Right, you've described
that person as a person,

30:55.821 --> 30:57.756
why not a man or a woman?

30:57.756 --> 30:59.558
- 'Cause it was so mutilated.

30:59.591 --> 31:01.260
I couldn't tell, all right.

31:06.165 --> 31:07.333
- I think we need to
do a perimeter search

31:07.366 --> 31:09.535
and I think we
need to do one now.

31:09.568 --> 31:11.837
- Yeah, I think you're right.

31:11.837 --> 31:13.405
- [Katie] Do you
have any weapons?

31:13.472 --> 31:14.673
- No, we don't carry firearms.

31:14.673 --> 31:16.708
That's a specialist unit does.

31:16.742 --> 31:18.177
- I got weapons.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.846
- You're not really listening
to this drivel, are you?

31:25.884 --> 31:27.486
- So.

31:27.486 --> 31:30.456
- (whispering)

31:30.456 --> 31:33.225
- [Bob] So, what
was the award for?

31:33.259 --> 31:34.460
- What?

31:34.460 --> 31:35.627
- [Bob] Well, the
most incompetent

31:35.661 --> 31:38.030
police sergeant in the district.

31:38.097 --> 31:41.100
(eerie tense music)

31:42.634 --> 31:44.836
(growling)

31:53.745 --> 31:55.247
(gasps)

31:55.281 --> 31:56.782
- What's wrong?

31:56.848 --> 31:59.418
- Whatever it is,
I've just seen it.

32:00.953 --> 32:01.653
- Where?

32:02.621 --> 32:05.457
- It was just staring at me.

32:05.457 --> 32:07.193
Evil eyes.

32:07.259 --> 32:09.595
(eerie tense music)

32:09.595 --> 32:10.929
- Do you need them weapons?

32:11.797 --> 32:13.832
- Weapons.

32:13.832 --> 32:15.034
Yous all stay here.

32:15.101 --> 32:16.969
Bob, we'll talk about
those weapon later.

32:17.003 --> 32:19.305
- I've got tonnes of
them in the greenhouse.

32:19.305 --> 32:22.308
(eerie tense music)

32:24.343 --> 32:27.213
(ethereal roaring)

32:39.425 --> 32:41.660
(coughing)

32:45.131 --> 32:48.034
(ethereal roaring)

32:49.301 --> 32:52.304
(eerie tense music)

33:20.132 --> 33:23.035
(ethereal roaring)

33:42.954 --> 33:44.823
(shouts)

33:44.890 --> 33:46.092
Did you lose it?

33:46.092 --> 33:46.992
- There are no weapons.

33:47.059 --> 33:49.528
- What do they look like then?

33:52.631 --> 33:53.532
- Run, run.

33:55.334 --> 33:58.337
(eerie tense music)

34:01.640 --> 34:02.741
- Brody, wait!

34:04.710 --> 34:05.544
Wait.

34:13.919 --> 34:15.154
- Come on!

34:15.154 --> 34:16.322
- Wait for me.

34:19.558 --> 34:22.461
(ethereal roaring)

34:29.835 --> 34:32.838
(eerie tense music)

34:56.962 --> 34:58.330
Shit, go, go, go.

35:28.794 --> 35:30.996
(shouting)

35:31.029 --> 35:32.030
Quick, help us.

35:32.030 --> 35:32.864
We've got people here.

35:32.864 --> 35:33.699
- What?

35:37.369 --> 35:38.537
- Get it up.

35:38.570 --> 35:40.071
What happened here?

35:40.071 --> 35:41.907
No, put your end down.

35:44.376 --> 35:47.213
(groaning)

35:47.246 --> 35:50.249
(eerie tense music)

35:55.086 --> 35:56.422
(groaning)

35:56.422 --> 35:57.923
- [Brody] Push it.

36:00.759 --> 36:01.660
Some chairs, some chairs.

36:01.660 --> 36:03.529
- Okay, I'll block it up.

36:16.675 --> 36:21.680
(ethereal growling)
(gunshot)

36:24.383 --> 36:27.118
- Man, you said,
you said nothing

36:27.118 --> 36:29.555
ever happens here, normally.

36:30.922 --> 36:31.823
- It don't.

36:33.259 --> 36:34.760
That's not normal.

36:37.996 --> 36:41.333
Apart from that runaway
a couple of days ago.

36:44.169 --> 36:45.871
- What runaway?

36:45.871 --> 36:49.375
(ethereal growling)
(screaming)

36:49.408 --> 36:52.411
(eerie tense music)

37:17.669 --> 37:19.538
Hello, is anyone there?

37:19.571 --> 37:20.406
This is PC Brody.

37:22.574 --> 37:27.279
We need immediate backup
at Little Pitchfield Manor.

37:38.490 --> 37:39.591
- How many were there?

37:42.461 --> 37:43.329
- Dozens of em.

37:44.463 --> 37:46.197
They just kept
coming out the woods.

37:54.005 --> 37:55.807
- What do you think it is?

37:56.675 --> 37:57.509
- Zombies?

37:58.544 --> 37:59.545
- I knew it.

38:00.912 --> 38:04.516
- Our barricade's not
gonna hold them for long.

38:05.451 --> 38:06.284
- Jesus.

38:09.455 --> 38:11.390
Joe, do you hear me?

38:14.125 --> 38:15.160
It's Shaun Cooper.

38:16.462 --> 38:17.363
We're at the old manor house.

38:17.363 --> 38:18.930
Look, we need backup now.

38:18.964 --> 38:22.334
There's just dozens of
them, like creatures.

38:22.334 --> 38:23.168
- IC9s.

38:24.135 --> 38:26.304
- IC9s, do you hear me, over.

38:27.673 --> 38:31.009
- Well, what do we do now?

38:31.009 --> 38:34.179
- We hold them off and
we wait for backup.

38:34.212 --> 38:35.246
Yeah?

38:35.246 --> 38:36.582
- Look, I agree.

38:38.216 --> 38:41.219
(eerie tense music)

38:57.503 --> 38:59.505
(farts)

39:02.040 --> 39:03.341
- Better out than in.

39:03.341 --> 39:04.776
- Oh please.

39:04.843 --> 39:08.847
- I'm sorry, I just get
nervous in these situations.

39:08.880 --> 39:09.781
- [Ellen] We're all nervous.

39:09.781 --> 39:11.417
Just try to control yourself.

39:11.417 --> 39:13.885
- Hey, it looks
like they're gone.

39:13.919 --> 39:15.153
- No, no I don't care.

39:15.153 --> 39:16.655
Okay, we stay here
where we are safe

39:16.655 --> 39:17.989
and we wait for them
to come and get us.

39:18.056 --> 39:20.091
- So your whole plan is
to sit and do nothing?

39:20.091 --> 39:22.093
- Well it sounds like
a great plan to me.

39:22.127 --> 39:24.162
- It's been two
hours and nothing.

39:24.195 --> 39:26.031
- Calm down.

39:26.031 --> 39:28.166
- It's gotta be some
sort of chemical attack,

39:28.166 --> 39:29.100
it's got to be.

39:29.134 --> 39:29.901
- If it was a chemical attack,

39:29.901 --> 39:31.369
why aren't we infected?

39:31.369 --> 39:33.038
- What do you think?

39:34.305 --> 39:35.140
- I don't know.

39:35.140 --> 39:36.475
Like I said, zombies.

39:36.508 --> 39:38.844
- No, no about getting
someone here to help.

39:38.877 --> 39:39.878
Okay, someone has to
go and find a phone.

39:39.878 --> 39:41.079
- No.

39:41.079 --> 39:43.449
- Bob, do you have
a landline here?

39:43.515 --> 39:46.418
- In my room but that's over
the other side of the manor.

39:46.418 --> 39:47.586
- I'll go.

39:47.619 --> 39:48.820
- [Katie] No, they could
still be out there.

39:48.887 --> 39:51.156
- Well look, we
can't risk it okay.

39:51.156 --> 39:52.658
- I was my college record holder

39:52.658 --> 39:53.725
over 100 metre sprint.

39:53.759 --> 39:55.927
I will be in and out.

39:55.961 --> 39:57.295
I know where it is.

39:57.295 --> 39:58.430
- Don't go.

39:58.464 --> 39:59.465
Stay here.

39:59.465 --> 40:00.799
- Dan, Dan, Dan.

40:01.967 --> 40:03.201
Come back through
the barricade, okay.

40:03.201 --> 40:04.002
It's not safe out there.
- I will be two minutes.

40:04.002 --> 40:05.003
I'll be right back.

40:05.871 --> 40:07.539
- Fuck's sake.

40:07.539 --> 40:10.942
(tense electronic music)

40:18.083 --> 40:21.086
(ethereal growling)

40:22.954 --> 40:25.457
(tense electronic music)

40:25.457 --> 40:28.359
(ethereal roaring)

40:34.800 --> 40:37.202
(screeching)

40:52.383 --> 40:55.253
(ethereal roaring)

41:04.129 --> 41:07.533
(tense electronic music)

41:16.675 --> 41:18.877
(shouting)

41:21.212 --> 41:23.549
(screaming)

41:27.452 --> 41:32.457
(ethereal roaring)
(wet guttural screaming)

41:48.840 --> 41:51.610
(low tense music)

42:09.861 --> 42:13.331
- Well, at least the
power's still on.

42:14.700 --> 42:17.202
- Think they're still out there?

42:17.235 --> 42:19.738
- Of course they're
still out there.

42:19.805 --> 42:21.139
You should have stopped him.

42:21.172 --> 42:22.340
You should have made him stay.

42:22.340 --> 42:24.009
- It's not within our
remit to use force

42:24.009 --> 42:25.510
or aggression to
control a situation.

42:25.543 --> 42:27.212
Okay, we deescalate.

42:27.212 --> 42:28.546
- Deescalate.
- Yeah.

42:28.580 --> 42:30.749
- PC Brody was
only doing his job.

42:30.782 --> 42:32.217
- You shut up.

42:32.217 --> 42:33.985
You wanted to press
charges and now he's dead.

42:34.052 --> 42:35.921
- Why don't you all shut up?

42:35.921 --> 42:38.256
- It's the end of the world!

42:39.457 --> 42:40.558
I've seen it.

42:41.760 --> 42:45.597
I've seen it for
nigh on 30 years.

42:45.597 --> 42:49.400
In my dreams and
nightmares, this is it.

42:52.570 --> 42:54.072
- What are you talking about?

42:54.072 --> 42:58.944
- I'm telling you straight,
I've seen it before, in visions.

43:02.614 --> 43:05.416
Nigh, it is out there.

43:06.384 --> 43:08.720
Nigh, it is waiting.

43:10.288 --> 43:11.122
- [Ellen] Who?

43:12.891 --> 43:13.725
- Them.

43:15.126 --> 43:16.928
- So not zombies then?

43:16.962 --> 43:20.766
- Zombies is like a
picnic compared to this.

43:23.669 --> 43:26.304
17 years ago, do you remember?

43:26.304 --> 43:31.242
17 years ago they came
a-looking, stalking

43:32.878 --> 43:35.346
like burglars looking
'round a house

43:35.346 --> 43:36.915
they're gonna raid.

43:37.849 --> 43:39.284
- He's right.

43:39.284 --> 43:42.287
- This aint no zombies.

43:44.756 --> 43:46.424
This aint gonna end.

43:48.794 --> 43:52.597
Nobody's coming to save us.

43:52.597 --> 43:54.866
We have to save ourselves.

43:56.902 --> 43:58.536
- He's right.

43:58.536 --> 44:00.205
It's aliens!

44:00.238 --> 44:01.406
- [Ellen] How can
you be so excited?

44:01.472 --> 44:03.975
- 'Cause for once in my life

44:04.009 --> 44:05.543
I get to be Sigourney Weaver.

44:06.945 --> 44:10.081
Look, I might just have a way
of getting us out of this.

44:10.081 --> 44:11.116
- [Brody] Okay, so
what's the plan then?

44:11.182 --> 44:13.618
- Weapons, bloody loads of them.

44:13.618 --> 44:15.821
Bob, where are those weapons?

44:15.887 --> 44:18.724
(low eerie music)

44:20.425 --> 44:21.760
Bob, Bob wait wait.

44:21.760 --> 44:22.794
- What?

44:22.828 --> 44:24.629
- Give me the weapon.

44:24.629 --> 44:25.931
- It's mine.

44:25.964 --> 44:27.132
- Now, I don't like
this as much as you do

44:27.132 --> 44:29.735
but give me the weapon.

44:29.801 --> 44:31.903
Now stay behind me.

44:31.903 --> 44:33.171
Not that close.

44:41.379 --> 44:43.014
Absolute silence.

44:43.048 --> 44:44.282
- That be good.

44:51.556 --> 44:54.525
(eerie tense music)

45:35.433 --> 45:37.903
(eerie music)

45:51.382 --> 45:53.484
- Where are those weapons, Bob?

45:53.484 --> 45:57.655
- In the greenhouse,
out by the allotment.

45:57.655 --> 45:58.489
- Come on.

45:59.390 --> 46:02.293
(eerie tense music)

46:06.798 --> 46:10.001
(electrical crackling)

46:35.927 --> 46:37.095
- There it be.

46:37.128 --> 46:38.129
- Wait, wait, wait.

46:38.129 --> 46:40.498
Is that one of the creatures?

46:42.000 --> 46:43.668
- He looks buggered.

46:43.668 --> 46:45.036
- No, they don't.

46:47.172 --> 46:49.007
- Are we gonna go or what?

46:49.007 --> 46:50.475
- Oh come on, Bob.

46:50.475 --> 46:51.843
We've all seen
enough of them films

46:51.843 --> 46:53.378
to know it's not dead.

46:53.411 --> 46:55.213
It's just laying there
waiting for us to approach

46:55.213 --> 46:57.015
and when we do it will be alive.

46:58.383 --> 47:01.552
- I'll bash it with this.

47:01.586 --> 47:02.587
- That won't work.

47:02.620 --> 47:04.890
It will still be alive.

47:04.923 --> 47:08.126
(eerie tense music)

47:08.126 --> 47:09.294
- Are you gonna
make a decision soon

47:09.327 --> 47:10.328
or others will come.

47:12.130 --> 47:14.966
- All right, come
on, let's do it.

47:24.175 --> 47:26.377
(growling)

47:30.715 --> 47:31.883
- There it be.

47:39.457 --> 47:40.625
- Thundercats!

47:41.692 --> 47:44.695
(eerie tense music)

47:56.407 --> 47:58.376
- That's Billy.

47:58.376 --> 47:59.577
- Can't be.

47:59.610 --> 48:00.912
We only seen him
a few hours ago.

48:00.912 --> 48:02.847
- That's definitely him.

48:02.880 --> 48:04.882
- That means whatever's
infected them

48:04.882 --> 48:07.218
is killing them in
just a couple of hours.

48:07.252 --> 48:09.087
(ethereal roaring)

48:09.120 --> 48:10.922
(gunshot)

48:10.922 --> 48:12.323
- Thank you.

48:12.390 --> 48:15.360
(eerie tense music)

48:18.663 --> 48:21.599
(ethereal roaring)

49:14.052 --> 49:15.720
- It's them.

49:15.720 --> 49:17.155
They're coming for us now.

49:17.155 --> 49:18.723
- It's okay, it's okay.

49:18.756 --> 49:19.657
It's gonna be fine.

49:19.657 --> 49:22.027
It's gonna be absolutely fine.

49:23.761 --> 49:25.430
Oi, Katie, what are you doing?

49:26.464 --> 49:27.832
- I can get out.

49:27.832 --> 49:29.534
They're distracted
with those two.

49:29.600 --> 49:30.501
I can get out.

49:30.501 --> 49:32.837
- No, no, just, uh, don't move.

49:32.837 --> 49:34.672
- You didn't stop Dan.

49:34.672 --> 49:35.740
Why would you stop me?

49:36.707 --> 49:39.610
- [Brody] Katie!

49:39.677 --> 49:44.015
Fuck's sake.

49:44.049 --> 49:47.052
(eerie tense music)

49:52.757 --> 49:57.762
(ethereal roaring)
(eerie tense music)

50:13.544 --> 50:15.880
(screaming)

50:17.182 --> 50:19.684
(tense music)

50:29.760 --> 50:30.761
- What's wrong?

50:30.761 --> 50:32.530
- It's my leg, it really hurts.

50:32.530 --> 50:34.265
- Is it where Billy grabbed ya?

50:34.299 --> 50:38.203
- No, no I scarped it on
an old tree stump just now.

50:38.203 --> 50:40.371
- Tell me the truth, Bob.

50:41.639 --> 50:43.541
- Nothing happened.

50:44.942 --> 50:46.444
- No it's not.

50:46.511 --> 50:47.612
It's where Billy, that
creature, grabbed you

50:47.612 --> 50:49.380
and now you're infected.

50:49.380 --> 50:50.615
You're gonna turn into
one of them monsters.

50:50.681 --> 50:53.551
- It was just an old
tree stump, I tell ya.

50:53.551 --> 50:54.385
- You're lying!

50:56.087 --> 50:57.388
- [Bob] You don't believe me?

50:57.388 --> 50:58.589
- If you turn into
one of them things

50:58.589 --> 50:59.990
I'll blow your
bleeding head off.

51:00.057 --> 51:02.427
- [Bob] I'm telling you
the truth, believe me.

51:02.460 --> 51:05.463
(eerie tense music)

51:06.297 --> 51:07.632
- Okay, come on.

51:11.336 --> 51:14.339
(eerie tense music)

51:42.333 --> 51:44.502
(ethereal roaring)

51:44.535 --> 51:46.671
(gunshot)

51:52.343 --> 51:53.344
Brody, Brody!

51:54.279 --> 51:55.079
Brody.

51:56.247 --> 51:57.081
Brody!

51:57.081 --> 51:58.349
- Oh, shit.

51:58.383 --> 52:00.951
- [Cooper] Here, take this.

52:00.951 --> 52:03.321
(tense music)

52:18.303 --> 52:20.505
- We thought you were dead.

52:28.446 --> 52:31.048
- Wait, where's Katie?

52:31.048 --> 52:33.384
- It's nothing.
- She's gone.

52:33.384 --> 52:34.385
I couldn't stop her.

52:37.822 --> 52:38.823
What's happened?

52:38.889 --> 52:40.658
- There's dozens of em.

52:40.658 --> 52:43.027
Look, I need to speak to you.

52:45.162 --> 52:47.765
One of them creatures was Billy.

52:47.798 --> 52:48.933
- Billy?

52:48.933 --> 52:50.201
Pissed up the tree Billy?

52:50.201 --> 52:51.035
- Yeah.

52:52.670 --> 52:55.072
That means this must be a virus

52:55.139 --> 52:58.142
and I'm guessing it's passed
on by physical contact.

52:58.175 --> 53:00.110
- Does that mean
it could actually

53:00.110 --> 53:01.779
be a chemical weapon's attack?

53:01.846 --> 53:03.848
- No, not in Little Pitchfield.

53:03.881 --> 53:05.750
Anyway, it's not airborne.

53:06.917 --> 53:09.454
- All right, what
weapons did we get?

53:09.487 --> 53:11.121
- Let's do our weapon's check.

53:15.260 --> 53:18.263
(eerie tense music)

53:44.322 --> 53:45.923
Have you had any
weapons training?

53:45.923 --> 53:47.057
- Oh yeah.

53:47.091 --> 53:48.593
We had a weeks intensive
combat training.

53:48.593 --> 53:52.797
Trust me, I know my
way a few of these.

53:52.797 --> 53:53.931
- How is he?

53:53.964 --> 53:55.466
- We need a doctor.

53:55.466 --> 53:57.001
- What now?

53:57.001 --> 53:59.670
Come here, I need to talk to ya.

54:01.071 --> 54:04.074
You know I said one of
them creatures was Billy?

54:04.141 --> 54:06.043
We see him less
than 24 hours ago.

54:08.546 --> 54:11.416
Yeah, well he was half
dead before I killed him.

54:11.416 --> 54:13.083
This could only mean one thing.

54:13.117 --> 54:14.619
- What?

54:14.619 --> 54:16.487
- This aint just a virus.

54:16.554 --> 54:18.155
It's an annihilation.

54:18.155 --> 54:19.390
We're being exterminated.

54:20.558 --> 54:23.528
(ethereal growling)

54:24.462 --> 54:25.296
You promised me!

54:27.298 --> 54:29.033
- I lied.

54:29.099 --> 54:34.071
(ethereal roaring)
(gunfire)

54:41.078 --> 54:44.682
- Look, once you kill
'em, no more virus.

54:44.715 --> 54:47.418
- No, what does that,
what does that mean?

54:47.418 --> 54:49.620
- It means we might
just survive this.

54:49.654 --> 54:52.056
Listen, listen!

54:52.089 --> 54:54.058
It's down to us now.

54:54.058 --> 54:56.026
I know this was your
first day and my last

54:56.026 --> 54:57.995
and I take back
everything I said

54:57.995 --> 54:59.797
about nothing
happening in this town

54:59.797 --> 55:02.800
but this is my town
and I'm not retiring.

55:02.800 --> 55:06.537
I'm gonna make a stand for
it, right here, right now!

55:06.571 --> 55:07.672
Are you with me?

55:07.672 --> 55:08.539
- Fuck yes!

55:10.140 --> 55:11.376
Yeah, come on.

55:11.376 --> 55:12.410
- Well come on!

55:12.443 --> 55:15.245
(shouting)

55:15.245 --> 55:20.250
(eerie tense music)
(ethereal growling)

56:49.006 --> 56:51.241
(shouting)

56:54.111 --> 56:56.380

1:00:34.799 --> 1:00:35.632

1:00:36.801 --> 1:00:39.970
(gunfire)
(roaring)

1:00:40.004 --> 1:00:40.805
Shaun!

1:00:42.639 --> 1:00:43.741
Shaun.

1:00:43.741 --> 1:00:45.175
- Oh shit.

1:00:45.175 --> 1:00:45.943
Bat!

1:00:48.245 --> 1:00:49.947
They're still coming.

1:00:56.987 --> 1:01:01.826
(gunfire)
(roaring)

1:01:01.826 --> 1:01:04.829
(eerie tense music)

1:01:41.365 --> 1:01:42.199
- Shaun!

1:01:42.199 --> 1:01:44.701
(gunshot)

1:01:44.701 --> 1:01:47.671
(eerie tense music)

(static crackling)

1:04:19.789 --> 1:04:21.458
- [Reporter] Hello,
this is Kathy Perkin

1:04:21.458 --> 1:04:24.028
with a channel 13
special news report.

1:04:24.094 --> 1:04:25.462
Breaking live.

1:04:25.462 --> 1:04:27.965
All parts of the
world are under attack

1:04:27.998 --> 1:04:30.968
from what appears to
be alien spaceships.

1:04:30.968 --> 1:04:32.469
I cannot believe I'm saying this

1:04:32.502 --> 1:04:36.540
but reports coming in are
that Toronto, New York,

1:04:36.540 --> 1:04:39.944
Paris, Moscow, and
London have been attacked

1:04:40.010 --> 1:04:42.679
and many famous landmarks
have been destroyed.

1:04:42.712 --> 1:04:45.882
Some world leaders
have been killed.

1:04:45.882 --> 1:04:47.384
We can now see some footage.

1:04:48.618 --> 1:04:51.288
This is like a scene
out of a war movie.

1:04:51.321 --> 1:04:54.992
It's total devastation
and destruction.

1:04:54.992 --> 1:04:56.426
The humanity.

1:04:56.426 --> 1:04:59.596
We don't know how many
causalities there have been

1:04:59.629 --> 1:05:02.532
but early estimates are
it's in the thousands.

1:05:06.136 --> 1:05:07.637
This is not a drill.

1:05:07.671 --> 1:05:10.007
This is a warning from
central government.

1:05:11.575 --> 1:05:13.177
Get away from the cities,

1:05:14.378 --> 1:05:16.880
go to a safe place
in the country.

1:05:18.748 --> 1:05:21.085
Arm yourself if you
can and be ready.

1:05:22.886 --> 1:05:24.054
They are coming.

1:05:25.922 --> 1:05:28.925
(eerie tense music)

1:05:35.299 --> 1:05:37.467
(gunfire)

1:05:41.038 --> 1:05:43.540
(tense music)

1:06:33.290 --> 1:06:38.295
(distant screaming)
(flames crackling)

1:06:44.468 --> 1:06:47.471
(eerie tense music)

1:06:51.541 --> 1:06:54.278
- We're gonna need
a bigger boat.

1:06:55.412 --> 1:06:57.247
- So you have seen it then?

1:06:59.183 --> 1:07:00.750
- Of course I have.

1:07:04.388 --> 1:07:05.755
Now let's give em hell.

1:07:09.259 --> 1:07:11.695
- But this time,
let's make it war.

1:07:13.663 --> 1:07:15.665
(shouting)

1:07:15.699 --> 1:07:20.704
(bells tolling)
(eerie tense music)

1:07:39.423 --> 1:07:42.592
(Jabz "Beef with Me")

1:10:11.375 --> 1:10:14.878
(sombre reflective music)

1:11:08.965 --> 1:11:11.835
(soft tense music)
