WEBVTT

00:10.176 --> 00:14.139
So I told my chauffeur,
"You get paid to drive,

00:14.222 --> 00:17.809
something any idiot 16-year-old
with a license can do."

00:17.892 --> 00:19.602
Still, he's easy on the eyes.

00:19.686 --> 00:22.272
Lucky for him, or I'd have fired his ass.

00:22.981 --> 00:26.693
Actually, I'd keep his ass
and fire the rest of him.

00:26.776 --> 00:30.196
-You could bounce nickels off of that ass!
-You're terrible.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.082
Fore!

00:41.458 --> 00:43.209
-Whoa, whoa!
Now, they move.

00:43.626 --> 00:46.629
The most exercise they've gotten all day,
trust me.

00:46.713 --> 00:48.298
Whoopsie-daisy!

00:48.965 --> 00:50.884
Oh, they do keep the course beautiful.

00:51.134 --> 00:53.303
These neanderthals

00:53.470 --> 00:56.639
They look like they should be panhandling
for an extra chromosome.

00:57.974 --> 00:59.017
Oh...

00:59.392 --> 01:02.520
Darling, I wasn't talking about you.
You look fine.

01:04.105 --> 01:06.191
I'm sure you'll grow into that face.

01:06.274 --> 01:07.692
Maybe not those ears.

01:10.361 --> 01:13.490
Is that Judge Harris feeling up
the snack cart girl?

01:13.573 --> 01:15.658
It sure as hell is.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.662
Maybe he thinks he lost
his gavel in there.

01:56.866 --> 01:59.577
Don't bother with cause of death.
I think I got it.

01:59.911 --> 02:02.372
But why are we here?
This is a range ball.

02:02.455 --> 02:03.832
The driving range is right over there.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.584
I declare this to be an accident.

02:06.668 --> 02:08.837
-God, you're good.
-Yeah, but...

02:08.920 --> 02:10.380
Tell them what you told me.

02:12.048 --> 02:14.467
After the ball hit Mrs. Brinks,
I turned,

02:14.551 --> 02:16.594
and I saw someone running away.
Over there.

02:22.225 --> 02:25.895
It looks like someone
might've been lying here in the weeds.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.606
This figure you saw
running towards the trees,

02:28.690 --> 02:30.817
were they holding anything

02:30.900 --> 02:32.360
A golf ball gun?

02:34.404 --> 02:38.283
No. But I think I did hear a splash.

02:49.377 --> 02:50.795
What a mess.

02:51.296 --> 02:53.256
The balls and clubs I get,

02:53.339 --> 02:55.967
but who the hell brings a suit of armor
to play golf?

02:56.050 --> 02:58.511
Though it would've saved
Mrs. Brinks' life.

02:58.595 --> 03:01.180
-True. Live and learn.
Found something!

03:08.813 --> 03:10.315
Yeesh.

03:10.648 --> 03:13.568
Yeah. Who's laughing now?

03:24.037 --> 03:25.914
What are we,
100 yards to the pin?

03:27.457 --> 03:28.458
Whoa!

03:30.418 --> 03:34.088
-You should've used less club.
-No more than an eight iron.

03:34.172 --> 03:39.552
Ladies and gentlemen, this golf ball gun
means we are now investigating a...

03:39.636 --> 03:40.845
Murder!

03:41.679 --> 03:43.181
Yeah, no duh.

03:43.848 --> 03:46.184
What? You don't own the word.

03:47.727 --> 03:50.104
-Not really.

03:50.772 --> 03:52.148
Kinda thirsty, though.

04:10.124 --> 04:11.501
Yeah!

04:11.584 --> 04:13.461
Of course, you're hungry.

04:14.420 --> 04:16.923
I know how you feel,
because I'm hungry, too!

04:17.006 --> 04:17.924
Yeah!

04:18.258 --> 04:22.762
Before, in the well that was hell,
I suffered.

04:25.640 --> 04:28.226
But God provided for me.
And now,

04:29.269 --> 04:31.187
I will provide for you.

04:32.897 --> 04:34.565
It's our world now,

04:35.900 --> 04:39.779
And we will hunger for His love no more!  Feed us, Father!
-God loves zombies!

04:56.296 --> 04:57.755
Behold!

04:58.715 --> 05:02.218
The voice of God
speaking to you through me...

05:05.179 --> 05:08.349
For I am His divine vessel!

05:08.725 --> 05:10.810
Yes! Yes!

05:11.936 --> 05:13.896
-Brothers and sisters...
-Yes!

05:13.980 --> 05:17.483
It is time to feed.

05:20.028 --> 05:21.904
Let's take what is ours!

05:25.867 --> 05:28.202
Let's take what is ours!

05:47.055 --> 05:50.058
Brains, best tubes in town.

05:50.141 --> 05:52.685
Beautiful brains here!
Feed the hunger.

05:52.769 --> 05:54.353
Keep the beast at bay!

05:55.396 --> 05:58.274
Brains, best tubes in town.

05:58.357 --> 06:00.735
Forty dollars makes the pain go away.

06:00.818 --> 06:02.987
Hey, hey. My cut, hand it over.

06:09.494 --> 06:12.997
-You're 200 bucks light.
-Oh, I don't know what happened.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.585
You're fired.

06:35.853 --> 06:41.359
No godless thieves will profit
from that which He has given to us.

06:42.527 --> 06:44.862
Strip them of their ill-gotten brains!

06:45.613 --> 06:47.907
Strip them of their blood-money!

06:55.039 --> 06:57.792
Bring the sinful heathens to me!

06:58.751 --> 07:01.921
Bring them to me!

07:12.432 --> 07:14.100
I know you're frightened.

07:15.101 --> 07:16.644
I'd be frightened, too.

07:17.728 --> 07:21.190
I have money!
Let's go to an ATM.

07:29.824 --> 07:32.785
The Lord doesn't need
your filthy, filthy lucre, thief.

07:34.871 --> 07:37.707
The Lord is calling
for a new world order!

07:40.918 --> 07:45.047
A world ruled
by the righteous undead!

07:56.517 --> 07:58.686
You sure you don't want
to talk about it?

07:58.769 --> 08:01.397
No, we're good.
We'll grab dinner later?

08:02.732 --> 08:05.776
-Clive...
-It's fine, Dale. Really.

08:07.820 --> 08:09.155
Okay. But you're not fooling me.

08:33.804 --> 08:35.348
What are you doing back there?

08:35.473 --> 08:37.391
Waiting for you to stop staring at me

08:37.475 --> 08:40.019
like the dumbest goat
on the mountain. Drive!

08:42.855 --> 08:44.232
You need to get in the front.

08:44.315 --> 08:45.775
I'm almost tempted to.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.527
It smells like felon back here.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.570
It does not smell like felon. This is...

08:52.156 --> 08:55.117
-The button for the privacy divider.

08:55.201 --> 08:58.829
You're a nice man, but you'd be so much
nicer if I couldn't hear you.

08:58.955 --> 09:01.332
All right, that's it.
Get in the front.

09:01.415 --> 09:04.168
We're not going anywhere like this,
Miss Daisy.

09:16.931 --> 09:18.015
Really?

09:19.267 --> 09:21.852
What? Go already!

09:21.978 --> 09:24.188
We have a ridiculous crime to solve!

09:30.486 --> 09:32.613
Yeah, that just clips on right...

09:34.156 --> 09:37.201
There you go! See? You got it.

09:37.326 --> 09:41.872
Wow, I managed to get dressed.
Watch out, human terrorists!

09:41.956 --> 09:44.584
Major, when do we get rifles?

09:44.667 --> 09:47.003
Week two, long as
you make us proud this week.

09:50.756 --> 09:52.842
Look, I know you're a little nervous

09:52.925 --> 09:54.677
and that's natural
before your first patrol.

09:54.927 --> 09:58.222
Who's nervous? I'm tired.

09:58.306 --> 10:00.766
You got me rooming with a bitch
that smells like a zoo animal.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.560
I can't get any sleep!

10:02.643 --> 10:05.271
Unless I'm talking to this guy.
The boy is dull.

10:05.354 --> 10:06.522
Try talking to him. You'll see.

10:06.606 --> 10:07.940
You can run your mouth all you want,

10:08.024 --> 10:09.734
as long as you don't run
when we're on the streets.

10:09.817 --> 10:11.235
You got something
you wanna say to me?

10:11.319 --> 10:13.279
Yeah, I just said it.

10:13.362 --> 10:15.740
You heard me say it, right?
That thing about "don't run"?

10:15.823 --> 10:17.450
Guys, no one's running.

10:17.533 --> 10:20.411
Remember that you're stronger
than the humans, you have guns.

10:20.494 --> 10:23.122
What's the only thing
that can hurt you?

10:23.289 --> 10:25.499
Duh! Head shot, General.

10:28.502 --> 10:31.047
Then maybe you should
secure that, rook.

10:32.757 --> 10:34.383
Let's move out.

10:46.604 --> 10:50.066
I guess this is what
they call the good life.

10:50.149 --> 10:52.693
With these knees, they better have
an elevator in the good life

10:52.777 --> 10:55.488
or you're going to be carrying me
up the stairs like a Sherpa.

10:55.571 --> 10:57.073
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

10:57.156 --> 11:00.826
Hey! All the clothing goes
in the second moving van.

11:01.619 --> 11:04.163
Hello, I'm Detective Babineaux, homicide,

11:04.246 --> 11:05.414
and this is Liv Moore.

11:05.581 --> 11:07.958
You might remember her
as the star of <i>Murder, She Wrote.</i>

11:08.292 --> 11:10.252
Where have you been
hiding all my life?

11:10.336 --> 11:12.922
You're like a white
Ricardo Montalban.

11:15.383 --> 11:17.802
-Uh, no.

11:17.885 --> 11:21.889
I am, or, rather, was,
Mrs. Brinks' chauffeur. Carlton Clerg.

11:23.808 --> 11:27.311
Mr. Clerg, it looks like word
of Mrs. Brinks' passing has gotten out.

11:27.645 --> 11:29.730
Well, I was there at the club
waiting for her to finish her round

11:29.814 --> 11:31.023
when she died. So...

11:31.732 --> 11:34.276
I'm sorry... Did you say homicide?

11:34.360 --> 11:36.195
Wasn't Mrs. Brinks struck by a golf ball?

11:36.278 --> 11:38.489
She was shot. By a golf ball gun.

11:38.864 --> 11:40.282
A golf ball gun?

11:40.366 --> 11:42.576
Did Mrs. Brinks have
any enemies you know of?

11:42.827 --> 11:45.496
None that I can think of.
Mrs. Brinks was well-loved.

11:45.579 --> 11:48.332
You two club-foots be careful
with that piano, <i>comprende?</i>

11:48.416 --> 11:49.667
You drop it, I'll bury you in it!

11:54.171 --> 11:56.298
-Her son.

11:57.299 --> 11:58.884
You think her son
might've wanted her dead?

11:58.968 --> 12:01.053
They've been feuding
for 30 years.

12:01.137 --> 12:02.555
Business dealings, I think.

12:02.638 --> 12:05.933
-Oh, he lives in Miami.

12:08.269 --> 12:10.563
It would be tough
for her son in Miami

12:10.646 --> 12:14.650
to kill Mrs. Brinks in the walled city
of New Seattle.

12:15.776 --> 12:17.027
Oh, yeah...

12:17.111 --> 12:19.697
Why would anyone kill
such a nice old lady?

12:19.780 --> 12:22.116
Every day at sunset,
she used to walk the gardens

12:22.199 --> 12:23.784
and tell me how much
she loved them.

12:23.868 --> 12:26.120
I bet she didn't love these gladiolas.

12:26.620 --> 12:29.331
They are crap. Crapiolas!

12:29.415 --> 12:32.376
Oh, Mrs. Brinks wasn't afraid
to tell you what she thought,

12:32.460 --> 12:35.296
but she had
such a generous spirit.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.465
A big laugh, and such a way with words.

12:37.548 --> 12:40.468
Raggle fraggle
friggin' fraggedy frack.

12:40.593 --> 12:41.469
Ugh...

12:43.012 --> 12:44.096
What are you doing?

12:44.180 --> 12:46.140
Just trying to warm up my rum toddy.

12:46.932 --> 12:48.767
-Yeah!

12:48.851 --> 12:50.728
And I'm trying to warm it up
in the microheater

12:50.811 --> 12:53.105
but I can never figure
these gizmos out.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.277
I'm sorry, one second. Coming!

13:01.447 --> 13:03.115
How you feeling, honey?

13:03.365 --> 13:05.409
You have to try
to eat something, okay?

13:06.285 --> 13:08.829
So you can get strong like Superman.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.416
-I'm not hungry.
-Try.

13:12.958 --> 13:15.711
This is my son, Alex.
He's home sick today.

13:15.794 --> 13:17.213
Sorry to hear that, pal.

13:17.796 --> 13:19.590
Get your shoes off the couch, kid.

13:19.798 --> 13:21.008
Were you raised in a barn?

13:23.219 --> 13:24.595
Yeah, you should probably
take your shoes off.

13:24.678 --> 13:26.388
Liv, take a look at this painting.

13:27.556 --> 13:30.017
Wow!
Look at those rocks!

13:30.100 --> 13:32.144
She wore that necklace
on special occasions.

13:32.228 --> 13:36.815
Really? I thought it sank
to the bottom of the sea with the <i>Titanic.</i>

13:38.150 --> 13:39.568
You made a joke.

13:40.110 --> 13:42.279
I would've shot her in the skull
for jewels like that.

13:44.156 --> 13:47.201
We haven't found them yet.
But I know where they might be.

13:48.661 --> 13:52.331
So, it seems that Mrs. Brinks was the
only one who knew the combination,

13:52.414 --> 13:54.792
so it's up to you to get it open.

13:54.875 --> 13:59.129
The digital lock on this safe
has over a trillion possible combinations.

13:59.213 --> 14:01.465
The heat death of the universe
would happen

14:01.632 --> 14:03.133
before we checked them one at a time,

14:03.217 --> 14:05.386
no matter how many GPUs
you throw at it.

14:05.469 --> 14:08.722
Now, this board,
designed by <i>moi,</i>

14:08.806 --> 14:13.060
uses a one million
qubit quantum chip that I got from...

14:13.143 --> 14:15.104
Well, never mind where I got it from.

14:15.187 --> 14:19.191
With this, we can test all the
combinations almost simult--

14:19.275 --> 14:20.776
Don't care, just open it.

14:20.860 --> 14:21.861
Hmm.

14:24.822 --> 14:26.615
They're lying.
Every one of ‘em.

14:26.699 --> 14:30.160
That's what I thought, too!
They're filthy, damn liars!

14:30.244 --> 14:32.371
Hey! Slow down, Jesse Owens!

14:33.038 --> 14:34.707
What makes you think so?

14:34.790 --> 14:38.460
Because you're the most repugnant,
repulsive person I have ever met.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.504
That seems uncalled for. Your point?

14:40.588 --> 14:42.381
They all lied.

14:42.464 --> 14:44.425
They said Mrs. Brinks was loved.

14:44.758 --> 14:46.886
"Nice. A generous spirit."

14:46.969 --> 14:48.846
That has not been my experience.

14:48.929 --> 14:52.099
Why do you think
they're "filthy damn liars"?

14:52.182 --> 14:54.059
They're the help. That's what they do.

14:54.143 --> 14:57.229
But I say you're barking up
the wrong tree, Clive.

14:57.313 --> 14:59.899
Everybody knows you follow
the money, stupid.

14:59.982 --> 15:01.442
Find the necklace,
find the killer.

15:02.109 --> 15:05.279
Liv, you're going
to need to dig deep

15:05.362 --> 15:10.159
and find a way to refrain from calling me
"dummy" or "stupid."

15:10.242 --> 15:12.745
You're right. You know,

15:12.870 --> 15:16.624
compared to the boy toy I've been
shagging, you're a regular Einstein.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.085
It was seriously scary
on that street.

15:20.169 --> 15:22.630
Have I told you humans
just blast away on shotguns randomly

15:22.713 --> 15:25.341
when they see our patrols?
They think it's hilarious.

15:25.424 --> 15:28.886
So of course we're all jumpy, and I'm
thinking, "These kids're gonna blow it."

15:28.969 --> 15:30.763
Totally green, first day on patrol,

15:31.472 --> 15:34.808
but they hung tough!
Kept their cool, listened.

15:34.892 --> 15:36.352
Great story.

15:36.435 --> 15:39.521
Now why don't you come over here,
you dirty little soldier boy,

15:39.605 --> 15:43.359
and let Mama show you a trick
I like to call the "Loni Anderson."

15:43.442 --> 15:45.361
Do I want to ask what brain you're on
right now?

15:45.444 --> 15:48.614
Why don't you just work
on being the strong, silent type?

15:52.701 --> 15:55.287
Oh, oh, oh. Watch the hip. Yeah.

16:10.135 --> 16:11.095
Oh!

16:12.179 --> 16:13.847
Good morning!
-Morning!

16:13.931 --> 16:16.308
Liv, last night, the "Loni Anderson"?

16:17.559 --> 16:19.228
That was a next-level maneuver.

16:22.022 --> 16:23.399
Where you rushing off to?

16:23.482 --> 16:25.609
I have things to do, darling.

16:25.693 --> 16:29.029
And I'm not in the habit
of crashing at a swinging bachelor pad

16:29.113 --> 16:31.740
-filled with sweaty young men.
-Seems like a habit.

16:33.117 --> 16:34.618
Something's burning.

16:34.743 --> 16:35.869
Oh! Guys!

16:46.380 --> 16:49.717
Hey! Stop screwing
around and get back to work!

16:49.800 --> 16:51.385
And no guns!

16:51.468 --> 16:54.972
It just shoots golf balls, Mrs. Brinks.
It's for gophers!

16:59.810 --> 17:00.978
What'd you see?

17:01.061 --> 17:02.896
Were you losing your virginity
to Howard Hughes?

17:03.814 --> 17:06.942
I believe I'll be saving
that information for my driver.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.236
-Liv, Clive isn't your--
-But first I need to get in

17:09.319 --> 17:10.863
nine holes at the club.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.333
Does she have
a country club membership?

17:23.500 --> 17:25.127
I don't think she has clubs.

17:25.836 --> 17:27.379
Ravi, got a sec?

17:27.463 --> 17:28.964
Ah, actually a little swamped
right now.

17:31.508 --> 17:33.594
It's a personal matter of a...

17:36.138 --> 17:37.681
Sexual nature.

17:42.311 --> 17:45.814
I'm sorry,
what I meant was,

17:46.607 --> 17:47.941
I have all the time in the world.

17:53.655 --> 17:56.533
-Okay, well, Dale and I...
-Hmm...

17:56.617 --> 17:58.410
Everything is great
between us.

18:00.829 --> 18:04.124
-But, for obvious reasons,

18:04.208 --> 18:05.501
we can't be...

18:08.378 --> 18:11.590
Intimate with each other,
and it's becoming a problem.

18:15.969 --> 18:18.097
Have you tried
mutual masturbation?

18:19.348 --> 18:22.643
It's like taking separate cars
to the same firework show.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.062
We have.

18:26.396 --> 18:29.399
But you really can't replace sex with...

18:30.400 --> 18:31.693
That and...

18:32.820 --> 18:34.780
And the urge is causing problems--

18:34.863 --> 18:37.908
Well, hello! Boy, did I walk in
at the right time.

18:37.991 --> 18:40.911
I had something to tell you,
but yours is way more interesting.

18:40.994 --> 18:44.498
This is a private conversation.
Let's go.

18:44.581 --> 18:46.792
More like a conversation
about touching privates.

18:46.875 --> 18:48.085
Don't mind me.

18:49.378 --> 18:51.755
Fine, I'll leave you boys alone.

18:54.550 --> 18:57.052
I'm dying to know how you think
I can help with this situation.

18:58.595 --> 19:00.597
Isn't there something that would...

19:02.724 --> 19:05.602
Temper my sex drive?

19:05.686 --> 19:08.772
I can prescribe an SSRI.

19:08.856 --> 19:11.316
Technically, it's anti-anxiety medication,

19:11.400 --> 19:15.028
but decreased libido
is a common side effect.

19:17.322 --> 19:18.740
Are you sure you wanna do this, Clive?

19:20.742 --> 19:22.494
Let's give it a try.

19:30.878 --> 19:32.588
You had something to tell me?

19:36.758 --> 19:39.720
Wouldn't you rather stay in there
with Ravi and talk about your genitals?

19:45.601 --> 19:47.186
It's a toss-up.

19:47.311 --> 19:48.353
Hmm.

19:49.605 --> 19:51.356
I had a vision.

19:51.523 --> 19:53.400
Then you get the nod.

19:54.067 --> 19:57.029
I was staring out an upstairs window
at Sandy's mansion,

19:57.112 --> 20:00.824
and I saw her three servants
taking target practice with a--

20:00.908 --> 20:02.784
A golf ball gun!

20:03.744 --> 20:05.120
A golf ball gun, yeah.

20:05.746 --> 20:07.831
Our killer has to be one of those three.

20:09.583 --> 20:11.585
Did you do the math yourself, genius?

20:13.003 --> 20:14.630
<i>Brothers and sisters!</i>

20:15.255 --> 20:17.841
Brothers and sisters,
come and be fed!

20:18.884 --> 20:21.887
Join us, I say join us,

20:21.970 --> 20:23.805
and never be hungry again!

20:23.889 --> 20:26.975
Join us, I say join us!
Come and be fed!

20:28.644 --> 20:33.315
<i>♪ Join us join us ♪</i>

20:34.733 --> 20:36.985
<i>♪ Join us ♪</i>

20:38.362 --> 20:39.905
<i>♪ Join... ♪</i>

20:42.115 --> 20:43.367
Stop.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.670
Well, aren't you the most
beautiful girl in the world.

20:55.128 --> 20:57.130
Do you have brains for sale?

21:00.384 --> 21:01.969
Brains for sale?

21:04.054 --> 21:06.598
That's not how
the good Lord works.

21:08.725 --> 21:09.810
Psst.

21:10.560 --> 21:14.064
We have brains

21:15.565 --> 21:17.150
for free.

21:19.861 --> 21:23.657
Tell all your friends.
All are welcome.

21:27.244 --> 21:29.871
All are welcome!

21:33.458 --> 21:34.793
Join us!

21:35.794 --> 21:37.587
Come join us!

21:50.767 --> 21:53.520
You're all only making that face
because you can't afford this.

21:53.603 --> 21:54.813
...thank you.

21:55.147 --> 21:59.693
That was Mrs. Brinks' lawyer.
You'll never...  Wow!

22:00.277 --> 22:01.778
That smell...

22:02.279 --> 22:04.948
Anyway, you'll never believe
what's in her will.

22:05.032 --> 22:08.702
Upon her death,
Mrs. Brinks left each of our suspects

22:08.785 --> 22:10.871
-a million bucks!

22:11.246 --> 22:13.999
-No, a million.

22:14.708 --> 22:16.585
Well, still, why would she do that?

22:16.835 --> 22:18.420
I'm curious myself.

22:18.503 --> 22:21.548
The lawyer says the beneficiaries
don't know about the money yet.

22:21.631 --> 22:23.175
But if one of them found out?

22:23.383 --> 22:24.843
I'm bringing them in.

22:25.052 --> 22:26.344
Let's see who's the least surprised

22:26.428 --> 22:28.180
about their $1,000,000 payout.

22:28.263 --> 22:29.931
That person is likely our killer.

22:30.015 --> 22:32.267
And who is this
magical face-reader

22:32.350 --> 22:34.811
that's gonna be able
to measure "level of surprise"?

22:35.979 --> 22:37.564
I'm a detective, Liv.

22:37.647 --> 22:41.068
You do realize the killer
will pretend to be surprised?

22:43.320 --> 22:45.363
It's what I do.

22:47.949 --> 22:50.786
You all told us Mrs. Brinks was a saint.

22:50.869 --> 22:52.537
But that's not exactly true, is it?

22:52.621 --> 22:56.291
We had a long talk
with Mrs. Brinks' friend, Maxine Lippman.

22:56.833 --> 23:01.797
She made us aware your duties
included more than driving her car.

23:01.880 --> 23:04.466
Don't be coy, Clive.
He gave her sex.

23:04.549 --> 23:07.761
Sex for money.
And you know what that makes him?

23:08.512 --> 23:09.971
A whore.

23:14.601 --> 23:17.354
The first time
it just kind of happened.

23:17.562 --> 23:20.524
I tried to cut it off,
but she said she'd tell my wife.

23:20.607 --> 23:22.109
Is that why you killed her?

23:22.692 --> 23:25.362
We know you all had access
to the golf ball gun.

23:25.445 --> 23:27.697
And you were already
at the country club waiting for her.

23:27.781 --> 23:29.407
I didn't do it.

23:30.408 --> 23:32.661
Your son, Alex, sweet kid,

23:32.744 --> 23:35.705
but he didn't just have
a cold the other day, did he?

23:35.789 --> 23:36.998
He has a heart defect.

23:37.082 --> 23:40.377
Maxine Lippman told me
the boy needs an operation in Los Angeles.

23:40.460 --> 23:43.338
You asked Mrs. Brinks
for a loan to hire a coyote

23:43.421 --> 23:46.133
to sneak him out of the city.
She turned you down.

23:48.927 --> 23:50.387
Is that why you killed her?

23:53.265 --> 23:56.226
Without that operation, he'll die.

23:57.018 --> 24:00.605
He's only six.
Mrs. Brinks would rather let him die

24:00.689 --> 24:02.816
than loan me 20 grand.

24:03.525 --> 24:05.527
She said it would set a bad precedent.

24:05.735 --> 24:07.112
Well, it would.

24:08.029 --> 24:09.531
Is that why you killed her?

24:11.449 --> 24:13.368
I am not a murderer.

24:14.119 --> 24:17.080
Mrs. Brinks promised to write
a recommendation letter

24:17.164 --> 24:20.458
to her Alma mater to get your daughter
into college back east.

24:20.542 --> 24:21.835
But she never sent it.

24:21.918 --> 24:24.462
If she'd gotten in,
she wouldn't have been here in Seattle

24:24.546 --> 24:26.298
and she wouldn't have been
turned into a zombie.

24:26.381 --> 24:28.717
Mrs. Brinks was a terrible person.

24:28.800 --> 24:29.968
No one will miss her. Is that why you killed her?

24:33.346 --> 24:35.307
I didn't kill her.

24:47.611 --> 24:49.154
All right, you're free to go.

24:53.533 --> 24:54.910
By the way,

24:55.952 --> 24:59.789
are you aware that in her will,
Mrs. Brinks left you a million dollars?

25:00.040 --> 25:01.082
What?

25:03.001 --> 25:04.294
That can't be true.

25:07.589 --> 25:10.300
-That's a lie, no. That's a trick.
-It's true.

25:11.134 --> 25:14.429
I worked for that woman
for 15 years

25:14.763 --> 25:16.765
and I never heard
a kind word from her.

25:21.228 --> 25:22.604
Give us a moment, please.

25:26.524 --> 25:29.277
So, Columbo, whodunnit?

25:31.112 --> 25:32.530
I don't know.

25:32.781 --> 25:36.076
But you saw all their faces,
and you're a detective.

25:38.411 --> 25:42.082
Not one of them cracked,
even a little bit,

25:42.499 --> 25:44.668
even when we gave them
a chance to turn on the killer.

25:49.047 --> 25:50.882
I cracked it as we knew I would,

25:50.966 --> 25:53.134
though it was no simple task.
I had to reconfigure the--

25:53.218 --> 25:54.803
This is the stuff from the safe?

25:54.928 --> 25:58.765
-Uh, jewels. Bonds. Legal papers.
-Hmm.

25:59.599 --> 26:00.934
The one from the painting.

26:01.309 --> 26:03.311
So stealing this
wasn't the killer's motive.

26:03.770 --> 26:06.564
There goes your big theory.
It's really not your day.

26:06.898 --> 26:09.985
That was your theory.
But there is this...

26:10.652 --> 26:14.072
The will. If anyone in the staff
managed to see this will,

26:14.155 --> 26:16.616
he or she would've known
there was $1,000,000 coming to them--

26:16.700 --> 26:18.493
Once Sandy Brinks was dead.

26:19.828 --> 26:25.166
-0-8-3-0-1-0.

26:28.753 --> 26:32.132
"Proudly serving the undead."
Screw you!

26:34.301 --> 26:36.261
Hey! They're closed.

26:36.344 --> 26:38.388
-They don't look closed.
-And you don't look stupid,

26:38.471 --> 26:40.307
so be smart and keep walking.

26:43.977 --> 26:46.104
You! Get out of here! Go!

26:47.230 --> 26:49.232
Al

26:49.316 --> 26:50.817
Sounds like a zombie name.

26:50.900 --> 26:52.277
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

26:52.360 --> 26:54.571
Are you a zombie?
Or just a zombie lover?

26:55.280 --> 26:57.699
Just get out of here.
The soldiers are here.

26:58.575 --> 27:01.119
Actually, we prefer
to be called the Peacekeepers.

27:01.745 --> 27:03.788
-Very bad.

27:03.872 --> 27:06.041
They're harassing my customers.
Look what they did.

27:06.166 --> 27:08.460
Okay, yeah.
We'll take care of the clean-up.

27:08.918 --> 27:10.795
How about you gentlemen
take your business elsewhere?

27:11.087 --> 27:14.424
Ah, no, we're real happy
right here, thanks.

27:14.591 --> 27:17.719
We love the...
What's the word I'm looking for?

27:18.428 --> 27:19.637
Ambiance.

27:19.846 --> 27:21.681
Well, I don't know about ambiance,

27:21.765 --> 27:23.933
but you're gonna need an ambulance
if you don't get moving.

27:24.017 --> 27:25.977
Relax! These guys are smart.

27:26.269 --> 27:28.605
They know they can
either leave on foot or in cuffs.

27:28.688 --> 27:30.690
What? Are you gonna
"miracle" those cuffs on us?

27:30.774 --> 27:31.900
You and some girl?

27:31.983 --> 27:35.236
Yeah, I mean sure, you guys got guns
but we got guns too.

27:36.446 --> 27:37.614
Theirs are bigger.

27:38.198 --> 27:40.325
Shoot them! I'm sick of this!
Every day with them.

27:40.492 --> 27:41.534
No one does anything.

27:41.618 --> 27:43.495
Okay, no, we got this.
Why don't you go inside,

27:43.578 --> 27:44.871
cool down, we'll get it all figured out.

27:49.084 --> 27:51.086
You know what, let's bounce.

27:51.169 --> 27:53.588
This place smells
like spoiled meat, anyway.

27:56.633 --> 27:59.469
Hey! Touch me again
and we'll see how tough you are

27:59.552 --> 28:00.929
with a bullet in your head.

28:01.638 --> 28:03.473
-Or a bullet in yours!
-Hey!

28:04.099 --> 28:06.309
-I'm going long! Going long!
-Hey!

28:06.393 --> 28:07.268
Major!

28:16.736 --> 28:17.779
Get her! Hey!

28:19.030 --> 28:20.573
-Stop!
-Come on!

28:20.824 --> 28:23.493
She scratched me!
Look what that bitch did!

28:24.077 --> 28:25.787
Stop...
-It's okay. Calm down!

28:25.912 --> 28:27.414
-You're gonna be all right.

28:27.872 --> 28:30.500
I'm not gonna be a zombie.
We made a pact, so do it!

28:30.917 --> 28:32.710
No! Hey, don't do that, all right?
He doesn't mean it.

28:32.794 --> 28:34.254
Do it! Please do it!

28:35.630 --> 28:38.383
Let him go.
Let him kill me, please!

28:38.800 --> 28:41.428
Hey! Hey, stop that!

28:41.511 --> 28:44.097
-I don't wanna be a zombie!
-Come back here!

28:44.180 --> 28:45.056
No!

28:47.058 --> 28:48.143
No...

28:53.314 --> 28:56.276
Zero-eight-three-zero-one-zero.

28:56.735 --> 28:59.612
August 30th, 2010.
Your son's date of birth.

28:59.988 --> 29:01.740
You programmed
Mrs. Brinks' safe,

29:01.823 --> 29:03.533
because she wasn't good
with that stuff, was she?

29:03.616 --> 29:05.869
Who can blame her?
All the stupid gadgets these days

29:05.994 --> 29:07.954
beepin' and boppin' and boopin'.

29:08.246 --> 29:09.497
I got this.

29:11.040 --> 29:13.752
You saw her last will
and testament inside the safe.

29:14.419 --> 29:16.504
You knew there was
$1,000,000 coming your way

29:16.588 --> 29:17.881
when Mrs. Brinks died.

29:18.047 --> 29:20.925
More than enough to get your little boy
to LA for that surgery.

29:23.052 --> 29:24.679
It could save his life.

29:27.515 --> 29:29.684
Why don't you write it
all down for us?

29:32.145 --> 29:34.647
Let's get this behind you, okay?

29:48.453 --> 29:49.662
An address?

29:51.790 --> 29:53.333
That's not what
we were hoping for.

29:53.416 --> 29:56.377
Take my son there,
and I'll confess to everything.

29:56.461 --> 30:00.381
It's all arranged with Renegade,
but it has to happen tonight.

30:02.091 --> 30:03.510
This address?

30:04.761 --> 30:06.596
It's in a neighborhood
that's been locked down

30:06.679 --> 30:09.224
because of anti-zombie
terrorist activity.

30:09.307 --> 30:11.976
Only authorized personnel
are allowed in.

30:12.060 --> 30:13.353
You're a policeman.

30:13.478 --> 30:15.146
Which is why I can't do this.

30:16.439 --> 30:19.526
Going there is a crime,
so is sneaking people out of Seattle.

30:19.609 --> 30:23.279
Please, my ex-husband is expecting him.

30:23.655 --> 30:26.866
The boy needs to be with his father.

30:29.410 --> 30:32.956
He will die if you don't help him.

30:35.625 --> 30:37.126
Please!

30:39.337 --> 30:40.380
Please.

30:47.720 --> 30:51.015
Liv, you got a soft heart,
which is wonderful,

30:51.349 --> 30:54.018
but I can't do this.
And neither should you.

30:54.143 --> 30:55.728
What the hell are you talking about?

30:55.812 --> 30:57.313
Of course I'm not going to do it.

30:57.397 --> 30:59.023
What am I, Mother Teresa?

30:59.107 --> 31:01.818
I am not responsible
for all the world's problems.

31:01.943 --> 31:03.236
Take her to the clink!

31:10.410 --> 31:11.661
Hey, Big Spender.

31:11.744 --> 31:14.122
Wanna take a lady
for a fancy gourmet meal?

31:15.582 --> 31:16.749
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

31:16.833 --> 31:18.793
I heard someone call hot dogs,

31:18.960 --> 31:21.045
"The filet mignon
of the common man."

31:23.131 --> 31:26.676
Someone who's never had
a filet mignon, maybe.

31:28.720 --> 31:29.929
I could've...

31:30.263 --> 31:32.015
You didn't want... So, look what I found
in the bathroom.

31:36.978 --> 31:38.938
Anti

31:39.898 --> 31:41.649
You're not the anxious type, Clive.

31:42.817 --> 31:45.862
Your composure is one
of my turn-ons.

31:46.237 --> 31:48.448
I don't know. Pressures at work. Hmm.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.869
So I read up on some of the side effects.

31:52.952 --> 31:55.288
How ‘bout we shut down
detective mode?

31:57.957 --> 32:01.586
"Decreased libido" was the one
that caught my eye.

32:02.670 --> 32:03.963
Okay, look.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.133
I love you.

32:08.509 --> 32:12.180
Everything is great,
except the one thing.

32:12.347 --> 32:14.557
I thought if I just took that
out of the equation, then--

32:14.641 --> 32:19.020
You're not doing this, baby.
We'll figure something else out.

32:22.148 --> 32:23.942
But I'm fresh out of ideas.

32:25.026 --> 32:26.152
You?

32:28.404 --> 32:30.949
I know you heard some
of what Clive was telling me earlier.

32:31.074 --> 32:32.951
And even though it's clearly funny,

32:33.034 --> 32:36.746
I mean, sexual performance stuff is
the lowest hanging fruit.

32:36.829 --> 32:38.581
You really shouldn't tease him.

32:38.665 --> 32:40.541
Now, that probably seems
impossible because

32:40.625 --> 32:42.835
you're currently on
the bitchiest brain alive, but--

32:42.961 --> 32:45.797
This woman's child is going to die,
and I'm letting it happen.

32:49.175 --> 32:51.636
I take it the brain has worn off.

32:53.805 --> 32:55.264
I've been awful.

32:55.390 --> 32:57.183
No, you have...

32:57.892 --> 33:00.311
Well, yeah, you've been awful.

33:00.395 --> 33:03.731
Really terrible.
I mean, the worst.

33:04.148 --> 33:07.235
But we'll make it right, I swear.

33:08.194 --> 33:11.030
Hey, what do we have to do?

33:15.535 --> 33:17.787
Thanks for bringing him.
We'll take it from here.

33:17.912 --> 33:20.331
There's enough in there
to cover the fee for the coyote.

33:20.415 --> 33:23.334
-We both chipped in.
-Thanks, that's amazing.

33:23.459 --> 33:25.628
Hey, little man. Come here.

33:26.004 --> 33:28.464
Everything's going to be just fine.

33:31.718 --> 33:32.844
Thanks.

33:36.431 --> 33:38.683
Hey, you okay back there?

33:39.267 --> 33:42.478
Piece of cake, right?
But we're at the checkpoint now, so shh.

33:58.578 --> 33:59.871
Hello, Officer. I'm not an officer.

34:01.581 --> 34:02.957
Soldier?

34:03.041 --> 34:05.543
I'm not sure what to call you.

34:05.626 --> 34:08.504
We're just on our way
to pick up a corpse.

34:09.005 --> 34:10.548
Who authorized this?

34:11.924 --> 34:14.385
A-a murderer, I suppose.

34:14.469 --> 34:16.888
Look, we get a call
there's a dead body,

34:17.013 --> 34:19.515
we show up and do our thing.

34:29.275 --> 34:31.319
-I'm going to get my supervisor.
-Ah...

34:32.945 --> 34:34.238
Sir? Oh, hello, Major.

34:56.886 --> 34:57.929
What's your business?

34:59.430 --> 35:02.600
We're, uh... Picking up a body.

35:02.683 --> 35:04.811
I'm pretty sure I'd know
if there had been a murder in this sector.

35:05.520 --> 35:07.855
This sector where
it's dangerous for zombies.

35:07.939 --> 35:10.066
Particularly those
who refuse to tan and dye.

35:10.149 --> 35:11.692
Look, do you want
to know our business?

35:12.610 --> 35:14.779
If you want to know
our business, I'll tell you.

35:14.862 --> 35:16.989
-But ignorance, in this case, may--
Major! I saw something moving back there.
Should we check?

35:34.632 --> 35:36.717
-They're clear. Let them through.
-But--

35:36.926 --> 35:38.302
Let 'em through!

35:53.109 --> 35:54.610
This is the address

35:54.694 --> 35:58.364
and it actually does look
very secret underground railroady.

36:13.462 --> 36:14.922
It's gotta be that one.

36:25.391 --> 36:26.934
Renegade?

36:28.519 --> 36:29.812
Who wants to know?

36:31.063 --> 36:34.025
A friend.
-Three friends.

36:35.818 --> 36:38.196
They're okay.
I know who they are.

36:38.946 --> 36:40.448
Come over here.

36:48.956 --> 36:50.541
You know who we are?

36:51.042 --> 36:56.005
Liv Moore and Ravi Chakrabarti
from the police morgue.

36:56.130 --> 36:59.717
-Oh, we have, but don't worry.

36:59.800 --> 37:02.678
Being forgettable
is an advantage in my line of work.

37:04.931 --> 37:06.224
You're Renegade.

37:06.891 --> 37:09.435
My friends call me Mama Leone.

37:09.644 --> 37:12.438
Like the Billy Joel song?
Is that your real--

37:14.815 --> 37:16.859
You know what? Doesn't matter.

37:16.943 --> 37:19.654
I'm sorry.
Renegade sounded...

37:21.113 --> 37:23.658
Well, you're not
who I expected either.

37:25.243 --> 37:26.827
You can explain later.

37:28.120 --> 37:29.455
But, you!

37:29.830 --> 37:33.876
I have been looking forward
to meeting you.

37:34.877 --> 37:36.420
We're going to get you
back to your daddy

37:36.504 --> 37:39.757
in Los Angeles lickety

37:41.550 --> 37:42.885
This is for you.

37:42.969 --> 37:44.178
Ah!

37:46.555 --> 37:50.476
Please understand, we're not
a for-profit organization.

37:51.185 --> 37:54.438
We've gotta buy off a lot of greedy people
to sneak people in and out.

37:55.064 --> 37:58.526
Alex, this is the man
that's gonna be taking you.

37:58.776 --> 38:00.820
He is one of our best!

38:01.112 --> 38:02.571
So you'll be fine, okay?

38:07.285 --> 38:09.954
Okay? All right. Now.

38:10.121 --> 38:12.164
Now, we cannot have you two
leaving the building

38:12.248 --> 38:13.833
the same way that you came in.

38:14.458 --> 38:15.876
There's more than one...

38:16.502 --> 38:19.880
Well, there's a secret panel
at the back of that dryer.

38:20.047 --> 38:22.008
You just have to feel around
for the latch.

38:22.550 --> 38:24.760
So exciting! It's like being
in a Bond film...

38:28.472 --> 38:30.141
Oh, there she is!

38:30.808 --> 38:32.727
Oh, hang on...

38:33.519 --> 38:36.856
Is there like a handle,
or do you push...

38:37.148 --> 38:39.275
-No, no, just keep looking.
-Yeah.

38:42.862 --> 38:44.030
Very funny.

38:45.197 --> 38:46.699
That was fun.

38:48.159 --> 38:51.454
See? I told you I could
make the tall man climb into the dryer.

38:52.705 --> 38:54.081
We should get going.

38:56.083 --> 38:59.211
I bet your dad
can't wait to see you.

39:00.713 --> 39:01.964
Let's go, pal.

39:08.846 --> 39:10.348
What a world, huh?

39:16.103 --> 39:18.230
-Hold on!

39:21.150 --> 39:23.402
-Liv.
-Before you start in on me,

39:23.527 --> 39:25.363
you should know
that I am in no mood.

39:25.696 --> 39:28.824
We were saving a sick child, okay?
Getting him out of Seattle.

39:28.908 --> 39:30.618
So, human smuggling?

39:30.701 --> 39:32.578
If anyone found out
I let you do that,

39:32.661 --> 39:34.497
I could spend years
in a deep freeze, or worse.

39:34.580 --> 39:37.792
Yeah, well, if Fillmore-Graves hadn't
caused this whole zombie epidemic

39:37.875 --> 39:40.836
then we wouldn't be living in
a walled city that required such things.

39:41.504 --> 39:43.964
I may have just saved your life
by risking my own.

39:44.298 --> 39:47.385
I know you're not feeling very chatty,
but how about a simple "thank you."

39:48.135 --> 39:49.261
Thank you.

39:50.554 --> 39:52.348
God, you're holier than thou.

39:55.017 --> 39:57.144
You... You think
you're the only good zombie.

39:57.228 --> 39:58.854
The only zombie trying
to make things right...

39:58.938 --> 40:02.400
Oh, I'm sorry. Maybe it's just that
I remember a Major Lillywhite

40:02.817 --> 40:05.194
who would've stood by
a sick child.

40:09.698 --> 40:11.325
This thing we've been doing,

40:11.409 --> 40:14.578
sleeping with each other
because we can, because it's easy...

40:15.579 --> 40:17.289
Yeah, we can't do it anymore.

40:17.915 --> 40:21.210
Not when I know that
my life choices so offend you.

40:22.211 --> 40:23.963
Agreed.

40:26.048 --> 40:27.466
Goodbye, Major.

40:34.640 --> 40:37.685
We shall ascend, my child.

40:37.768 --> 40:39.061
Bless you, Father.

40:42.982 --> 40:46.610
We shall ascend, my child.

40:46.986 --> 40:48.654
Bless you, Father.

40:58.038 --> 41:00.416
Are ye hungry, my children?

41:00.541 --> 41:03.043
Feed us, Father!
