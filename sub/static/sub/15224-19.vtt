01:22.634 --> 01:24.067
All right, where's
the mechanic on duty?

01:24.100 --> 01:25.067
I'm going to kill him.

01:25.100 --> 01:26.100
What are you
talking about?

01:26.133 --> 01:27.400
I don't want to talk--
I got to hit.

01:27.434 --> 01:28.567
Hey, hey, hey.
Tony, Tony, Tony,

01:28.601 --> 01:29.734
take it easy,
take it easy.

01:29.767 --> 01:30.934
Nobody's going
to hit anybody.

01:30.968 --> 01:33.067
Now just sit down
and tell us about it calmly.

01:33.100 --> 01:34.234
All right, Alex.
Yeah.

01:34.267 --> 01:35.701
What is it?
I'm still shaking.

01:35.734 --> 01:36.901
I'm driving down Fifth Avenue

01:36.934 --> 01:38.400
just before
Saint Patrick's Cathedral.

01:38.434 --> 01:39.567
Yeah.
Yeah.

01:39.601 --> 01:40.901
I'm coming to a red light,

01:40.934 --> 01:42.334
I go to put my foot
on the brake,

01:42.367 --> 01:44.467
my foot goes straight through
to the floorboard.

01:44.501 --> 01:45.667
Oh, no. My, God. Oh.

01:45.701 --> 01:47.901
So I make it through the
first intersection okay, right,

01:47.934 --> 01:49.367
but I can't stop this cab.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.000
Here I am doing
50 miles an hour

01:51.033 --> 01:53.501
straight down a road,
completely out of control.

01:53.534 --> 01:55.000
Man, it's true what they say--

01:55.033 --> 01:56.634
your life
flashes in front of you.

01:56.667 --> 01:58.334
You know,
I lost a lot of fights.

01:58.367 --> 02:00.634
So what'd you do?

02:00.667 --> 02:02.534
So I did the first thing
that came to mind.

02:02.567 --> 02:04.801
I stopped myself
by driving into a lamppost.

02:04.834 --> 02:06.968
Tony, why didn't pull
on the emergency brake?

02:07.000 --> 02:08.467
It's for parking, Alex.

02:08.501 --> 02:11.634
And emergencies,
hence the name, emer...

02:11.667 --> 02:13.033
You know,
there's a logic to that.

02:13.067 --> 02:14.200
Yeah.

02:14.234 --> 02:15.367
You know something?

02:15.400 --> 02:16.734
This is not an
isolated incident.

02:16.767 --> 02:19.367
Almost every night somebody has
some kind of serious accident

02:19.400 --> 02:20.801
with a cab from this garage.

02:20.834 --> 02:22.200
Hey, I don't care.
All I know is

02:22.234 --> 02:24.367
because of some dumb mechanic,
I almost bought it.

02:24.400 --> 02:25.767
Now, now, now,
Tony, don't get...

02:25.801 --> 02:27.534
don't be so quick
to blame the mechanics.

02:27.567 --> 02:29.734
They can only work
with what they've got,

02:29.767 --> 02:31.767
and some powers that be
around here

02:31.801 --> 02:33.300
don't want to give them
new cabs.

02:44.767 --> 02:46.400
For a minute there

02:46.434 --> 02:49.834
I thought I forgot
to close the old porthole.

02:56.133 --> 02:57.667
You got something on your minds?

02:57.701 --> 02:59.234
Yeah, you might
say that, Louie.

02:59.267 --> 03:00.901
You know, uh, the cabs,

03:00.934 --> 03:02.334
they've been
falling apart lately,

03:02.367 --> 03:05.100
and Tony's brakes,
they just went out on him.

03:05.133 --> 03:06.367
I mean, every time
we go out of here,

03:06.400 --> 03:07.534
our lives are in danger,

03:07.567 --> 03:09.534
and we think it's about time
you do something about it.

03:09.567 --> 03:10.868
That's right, Louie.

03:10.901 --> 03:12.701
Now you better stop and listen.

03:12.734 --> 03:15.133
This could easily
turn into an ugly mob.

03:15.167 --> 03:17.200
I thought most of these people

03:17.234 --> 03:19.467
were just about as ugly
as they could get.

03:19.501 --> 03:20.801
I knew
I shouldn't have said that.

03:20.834 --> 03:22.434
Louie, man,
that's it.
All right,
all right, all right.

03:22.467 --> 03:23.868
Hear me out.
So what are you
going to do?

03:23.901 --> 03:24.934
All right, hear me out.

03:24.968 --> 03:27.100
I can understand
that you're upset about this,

03:27.133 --> 03:29.701
and I'm going to do something
that I don't normally do,

03:29.734 --> 03:31.033
but I think the gravity

03:31.067 --> 03:32.801
of this situation
calls for it.

03:32.834 --> 03:33.901
Yeah, like, what?

03:33.934 --> 03:35.701
I'm going to write out a report.

03:35.734 --> 03:36.868
Aw, come on!
That never works!

03:36.901 --> 03:39.300
Don't try to talk me out of it!

03:39.334 --> 03:41.834
( <i>all talking at once</i> )

03:41.868 --> 03:44.901
When the welfare of my drivers
is at stake,

03:44.934 --> 03:46.901
no step is too drastic.

03:46.934 --> 03:49.400
Jeff, give me the report sheet.

03:50.434 --> 03:51.567
( <i>blows</i> )

03:51.601 --> 03:52.901
All right, now
what's the date?

03:52.934 --> 03:54.901
Hey, Louie, you're always
writing those reports,

03:54.934 --> 03:57.067
and they don't get us anywhere.

03:58.100 --> 03:59.734
You're right.

03:59.767 --> 04:01.400
A report isn't enough.

04:01.434 --> 04:03.334
Tell you what I'm going to do.

04:03.367 --> 04:07.901
I am going to issue
"drive defensively" stickers.

04:07.934 --> 04:09.100
Hey, Louie.

04:09.133 --> 04:11.734
You're not going
in that cage, Louie.

04:11.767 --> 04:13.901
You get in there, and
you lock the door,

04:13.934 --> 04:15.367
and it's business
as usual.

04:15.400 --> 04:16.868
In fact, you're not
going anywhere

04:16.901 --> 04:18.801
until you promise to do
something about this thing.

04:18.834 --> 04:19.868
ELAINE:
That's right, Louie.

04:19.901 --> 04:20.868
TONY:
That's right.

04:20.901 --> 04:22.200
Okay.

04:22.234 --> 04:24.701
Go blow-dry your face.

04:24.734 --> 04:26.367
What are you doin...?

04:31.000 --> 04:32.367
Hyah!

04:32.400 --> 04:34.200
TONY:
Open up or I'll
break it in, Louie.

04:34.234 --> 04:37.200
Not by the hair
of my chinny-chin-chin.

04:37.234 --> 04:38.767
MAN:
Break it down!

04:38.801 --> 04:39.868
Break it down!

04:39.901 --> 04:41.033
Get in there!

04:41.067 --> 04:42.200
Where'd he go?

04:42.234 --> 04:43.367
There's a secret passage.

04:43.400 --> 04:45.434
Where is he?!

04:46.501 --> 04:47.634
ELAINE:
There he is!

04:47.667 --> 04:49.400
Go get him!

04:51.834 --> 04:54.534
Hah-hah! Hah-hah!

04:58.334 --> 05:00.701
All right.

05:00.734 --> 05:03.868
You forced me to give
up one of my secrets,

05:03.901 --> 05:05.367
but I got others,

05:05.400 --> 05:07.634
and I'm not going
to reveal them...

05:07.667 --> 05:09.567
unless, of course,
Nardo wants

05:09.601 --> 05:11.033
to beat them out of me.

05:11.067 --> 05:12.234
Okay, that's it.

05:12.267 --> 05:13.534
I think we should walk.

05:13.567 --> 05:14.901
No, no, come on! Guys!

05:14.934 --> 05:17.701
To walk out is absolutely nuts.

05:17.734 --> 05:18.601
Hey, hang on, guys.

05:18.634 --> 05:19.701
I mean, come on.

05:19.734 --> 05:21.200
We have some recourse here.
What recourse?

05:21.234 --> 05:22.367
Let's talk about this.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.200
The first thing
I think we ought to do

05:24.234 --> 05:25.501
is we get our shop steward

05:25.534 --> 05:27.701
to issue a complaint
with the union.

05:27.734 --> 05:29.300
All right,
who's the shop steward?

05:29.334 --> 05:30.501
Uh, isn't it
Stubby Detmuller?

05:30.534 --> 05:31.701
No, no, no, he retired.

05:31.734 --> 05:33.567
It was Detmuller,
it was Detwyler.

05:33.601 --> 05:35.434
No, Detwyler's the guy
from the day shaft,

05:35.467 --> 05:37.501
he got thrown in the can
for beating his wife.

05:37.534 --> 05:39.667
I thought his name was Jim Petty
or something.

05:39.701 --> 05:42.601
No, Jim Petty is the backup
goalie for the Rangers.

05:42.634 --> 05:46.167
Just what I was afraid of--
they're getting organized.

05:46.200 --> 05:47.434
Well, one thing's obvious--

05:47.467 --> 05:49.200
we got to elect
a new shop steward.

05:49.234 --> 05:50.868
Okay, let's do it.
Come on!

05:50.901 --> 05:52.467
All right,
who we gonna get? Come on.

05:52.501 --> 05:53.667
Think, think.

05:53.701 --> 05:55.968
JIM:
Hey, uh, wait a minute.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.701
Who's that tall, red-headed guy,
comes in on weekends?

05:59.734 --> 06:01.234
His name's Jack
something or other.

06:01.267 --> 06:03.267
Why? You want
to nominate him?

06:03.300 --> 06:05.634
No, I just couldn't
think of his name.

06:06.667 --> 06:10.701
Jim, we're trying to find
a shop steward.

06:10.734 --> 06:13.200
So I nominate me.

06:13.234 --> 06:14.467
You?

06:14.501 --> 06:16.567
Yeah, man, I'm the guy
who almost got killed today.

06:16.601 --> 06:17.834
I deserve to see this through.

06:17.868 --> 06:19.067
I'm mad and I want it.

06:19.100 --> 06:20.167
And I second it!

06:20.200 --> 06:21.334
I mean, if he's so mad,

06:21.367 --> 06:23.067
he might be able
to get something done, right?

and I mean right now.

06:43.501 --> 06:48.100
So you're the new shop
steward, huh, Banta?

06:48.133 --> 06:49.767
You've got it.

06:49.801 --> 06:52.601
Congratulations.

06:52.634 --> 06:55.133
Thanks, Louie.

06:55.167 --> 06:56.634
Now, hey,
but I mean business here.

06:56.667 --> 06:58.067
Oh, yeah. Of course.

06:58.100 --> 07:00.801
Just step right into my cage,
and we'll talk about it.

07:00.834 --> 07:02.601
You want me
to come into your cage?

07:02.634 --> 07:03.801
Why, certainly.

07:03.834 --> 07:05.100
You're the new
shop steward.

07:05.133 --> 07:07.000
I'm not going to let
you stand out there

07:07.033 --> 07:09.167
on the floor
with the rabble.

07:09.200 --> 07:12.501
Come on in here
and have a seat.

Right foot, left foot,

All right, all right,
Tony, Tony, okay.

07:26.367 --> 07:27.667
Now before
you get started here--

07:27.701 --> 07:29.667
and I do want to hear
everything you got to say--

07:29.701 --> 07:31.434
I just want to let you know

07:31.467 --> 07:34.534
that I was pulling for you
during this election.

07:34.567 --> 07:36.367
I mean, it's high time

07:36.400 --> 07:38.834
that your talents
were recognized around here.

07:38.868 --> 07:40.200
Oh, gee. Thanks, Louie.

07:40.234 --> 07:42.200
And I think that
you're going to fit right in

07:42.234 --> 07:44.033
down at the Tide Pool.

07:44.067 --> 07:46.033
Yeah, well, that's all well
and good, Louie, but...

07:46.067 --> 07:48.033
Tide Pool?
What's a Tide Pool?

07:48.067 --> 07:50.200
That's that restaurant
around the corner

07:50.234 --> 07:52.968

after hours.

that you're the shop steward,

07:55.167 --> 07:56.834
I'm sure
you're going to want

07:56.868 --> 07:58.868
to spend time
down there yourself.

to love this place.

hanging from the ceiling

wear leis, in keeping

08:14.267 --> 08:16.033
with the Polynesian cuisine.

And they got
an exotic drink down there

right off your keester.

sounds great but...

in there the other night.

Really?
Yeah.

This is a classy joint.

Listen, after the shift is over,
you come on down there,

08:33.801 --> 08:35.667
and I'll introduce you around
to the gang.

08:35.701 --> 08:37.501
Should I dress
or anything, Lou?

08:37.534 --> 08:39.868
Sure, well, a sport coat
would be nice, huh?

to try this drink.

It's called the monsoon.

08:53.767 --> 08:56.434

your sky is clear.

Big.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.167
Well, I'm new at this.

I figured I'd get him down
to Tide Pool,

09:15.734 --> 09:17.000
fill him full with monsoons
and...

09:17.033 --> 09:19.267
Tony, please
don't take this personally,

09:19.300 --> 09:21.667
but if we're going to get
anything done, we need a recall.

Well, that's just your opinion,
man.

what everybody else says.

09:28.868 --> 09:30.167
Well, look at it this way, Tony,

09:30.200 --> 09:33.100
you... you brought us
all together on one issue.

09:33.133 --> 09:35.100
Okay, nominations
are reopened.

09:35.133 --> 09:36.601
I nominate Tony.

09:36.634 --> 09:39.901
Jim! Why would you want
to nominate Tony?!

09:39.934 --> 09:41.801
There's no substitute
for experience.

09:41.834 --> 09:43.367
Oh!

09:46.234 --> 09:48.567
You know, I-I think
this job-steward,

09:48.601 --> 09:51.200
report-to-the-union
stuff is a lot of crap.

09:51.234 --> 09:53.033
I mean, it never
accomplishes anything.

09:53.067 --> 09:54.501
We've been trying
it for years,

09:54.534 --> 09:55.868
and nothing's
ever been done.

09:55.901 --> 09:57.100
But what choice do we have?

09:57.133 --> 09:59.000
The choice we have
is walking out of here

09:59.033 --> 10:00.334
until these cabs are fixed!

10:00.367 --> 10:01.667
Let's go!

10:01.701 --> 10:03.033
( <i>angry yelling</i> )

10:03.067 --> 10:04.734
Hold it. Hold it. Hold it!

10:04.767 --> 10:06.067
( <i>whistles</i> )

10:06.100 --> 10:07.400
Now listen.

10:07.434 --> 10:09.634
A wildcat strike
is absolutely nuts.

10:09.667 --> 10:12.033
All we're doing is we're giving
them the chance to fire us.

10:12.067 --> 10:14.701
Now, I say that there are
other channels we can go through

10:14.734 --> 10:17.167
to get what we want
without losing anything.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.300
Well, now, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

10:18.334 --> 10:19.734
She's making sense.
She's making sense.

10:19.767 --> 10:21.067
Go ahead.
Yeah, okay.

10:21.100 --> 10:23.667
I vote Elaine
shop steward!

10:23.701 --> 10:26.334
No, no.
( <i>all agreeing</i> )

10:26.367 --> 10:28.334
Elaine, you
have to do this.

10:28.367 --> 10:29.701
Yeah, man, somebody's got
to help us with this.

10:29.734 --> 10:31.000
( <i>sighs</i> )

10:31.033 --> 10:32.801
You'd be my choice.

10:32.834 --> 10:35.801
Okay, I'll give it a shot.

10:35.834 --> 10:37.000
( <i>cheering</i> )

10:37.033 --> 10:38.200
All right, but...

10:38.234 --> 10:40.400
Whoa, whoa. But...

10:40.434 --> 10:43.234
I'm not going to soil myself
talking to Louie.

10:43.267 --> 10:45.567
He's just Mackenzie's lackey,
right?

10:45.601 --> 10:47.033
ALEX:
Right.

10:47.067 --> 10:49.501
So I'm going up
to talk to the big man himself.

10:49.534 --> 10:51.133
All right.
All right.

10:51.167 --> 10:52.801
All right.
All right.

10:52.834 --> 10:56.133
( <i>all chanting</i> ):
Elaine... Elaine...
Elaine... Elaine...

10:57.534 --> 10:59.467
( <i>excited chatter</i> )

11:08.234 --> 11:09.701
So...

11:09.734 --> 11:13.033
Nardo's your new
shop steward, huh?

11:13.067 --> 11:14.367
Wise choice.

11:14.400 --> 11:15.868
( <i>snorts</i> )

11:15.901 --> 11:19.567
What do you mean...
( <i>imitates snort</i> )?

11:19.601 --> 11:23.300
I know how
Mackenzie handles people.

11:29.334 --> 11:31.968
Boy, Elaine's
right up there,

11:32.000 --> 11:34.167
nose-to-nose
with the boss,

11:34.200 --> 11:38.100
and our careers are
hanging in the balance.

11:38.133 --> 11:40.834
The suspense is
unbearable, isn't it?

11:40.868 --> 11:43.133
Sure is, Jim.

11:43.167 --> 11:44.334
( <i>sighs</i> )

11:44.367 --> 11:46.634
Well, see you tomorrow.

11:52.667 --> 11:55.300
Take it easy, Jim.

11:56.334 --> 11:58.100
ALEX:
Hey, here she is!

11:58.133 --> 11:59.100
How'd you do?

11:59.133 --> 12:00.667
Hey, Elaine, that was,
like, really quick.

12:00.701 --> 12:01.934
Uh, what happened?

12:01.968 --> 12:05.033
Well, Mackenzie said that the
profit margin is so low already

12:05.067 --> 12:06.667
that there's nothing
he can do about it.

12:06.701 --> 12:08.968
But I told him

12:09.000 --> 12:11.534
that we don't want to risk our
lives in these cabs anymore.

12:11.567 --> 12:13.033
So he said that, uh,

12:13.067 --> 12:15.801
"No one told you
to take this job anyway."

12:15.834 --> 12:17.067
Wh-What did you say then?

12:17.100 --> 12:19.200
I said what any good
New York cab driver would say

12:19.234 --> 12:20.501
under those circumstances.

12:20.534 --> 12:21.467
( <i>laughing</i> )

12:21.501 --> 12:23.901
I also said
that we're on strike.

12:23.934 --> 12:24.901
( <i>cheering</i> )

12:24.934 --> 12:27.434
Shut it down! Shut it down!

12:27.467 --> 12:30.634
( <i>all chanting</i> ):
Shut it down! Shut it down!

12:30.667 --> 12:33.300
Oh, no, no, no!

12:33.334 --> 12:36.100
Oh, no, not a strike!

12:36.133 --> 12:38.000
Oh, fie!

12:39.167 --> 12:41.534
This really puts me
in a bad position.

12:41.567 --> 12:43.901
Now, where am I going to find

12:43.934 --> 12:46.767
people capable enough
to drive cabs?

12:46.801 --> 12:48.334
Yeah, where, Lou? Come on.

12:48.367 --> 12:50.367
 <i>Daily News! Daily News!</i>

12:50.400 --> 12:51.801
Hey, kid!

12:51.834 --> 12:54.601
You want to make
some big bucks?

12:55.868 --> 12:57.167
Take out Cab 132.

12:57.200 --> 12:59.868
Come on. Get out
of the news field,

12:59.901 --> 13:01.767
get into the people-mover field.

13:01.801 --> 13:04.167
You'll make some
big bucks, kid.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.534
And remember--

13:05.567 --> 13:06.901
the big pedal's
the brake.

13:15.334 --> 13:18.834
LOUIE:
All right, attention,
substitute drivers.

13:18.868 --> 13:21.767
We got a lot of cabs
to get out here.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.601
Hotchkiss.

13:23.634 --> 13:26.467
84. Hotchkiss.

13:29.767 --> 13:32.234
Okay, Mr. Hotchkiss,

13:32.267 --> 13:35.234
now, watch out
for any drunks out there.

13:35.267 --> 13:37.067
Right? Go on out there.

13:37.100 --> 13:39.100
Uh, Ferguson?

13:39.133 --> 13:40.968
Eight sixty-six.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.467
Ferguson!

13:43.501 --> 13:47.934
Somebody get Ferguson
started there.

13:50.567 --> 13:53.200
Okay, Mr. Ferguson,

13:53.234 --> 13:56.868
now, don't go rushing
around here.

13:56.901 --> 13:58.534
All right, here you go.

13:58.567 --> 14:00.567
Life's too short
to rush around there.

14:00.601 --> 14:02.334
Go out there and
knock them dead.

14:02.367 --> 14:04.434
Uh, Scooter?

14:04.467 --> 14:05.767
There you go. 626.

14:05.801 --> 14:09.100
Go out there and buck,
buck, buck, buck, buck.

14:09.133 --> 14:10.667
Whitey? There you go.

14:10.701 --> 14:12.934
Get out there
and make some money.

14:12.968 --> 14:14.934
Stretch? On your way.

14:14.968 --> 14:17.534
My biggest booker here.

14:17.567 --> 14:19.701
Okay, kid,
now, you get out there

14:19.734 --> 14:21.934
and, remember,
red means "stop,"

14:21.968 --> 14:23.467
green means "go."

14:23.501 --> 14:25.300
( <i>cackling</i> )

14:25.334 --> 14:27.734
I love you mugs.

14:27.767 --> 14:29.400
Ooh, it's cold.

14:29.434 --> 14:31.734
What are you doing
in here, Wheeler?

14:31.767 --> 14:33.434
It's my turn to get coffee.

14:33.467 --> 14:34.701
Huh-huh.

14:34.734 --> 14:38.000
Pretty cold out there
on the picket line, ain't it?

14:38.033 --> 14:39.734
Oh, it-it's not so bad.

14:39.767 --> 14:41.267
( <i>cackling</i> )

14:41.300 --> 14:43.901
Louie, the coffee machine's
not working.

14:43.934 --> 14:47.167
It's just not working
for non-employees.

14:47.200 --> 14:49.801
Yeah, well, this non-employee
wants his quarter back.

14:49.834 --> 14:51.834
Put it in with your demands,
Wheeler.

14:53.067 --> 14:54.167
Hey, Bob?
What?

14:54.200 --> 14:55.234
Don't you want
your message?

14:55.267 --> 14:56.300
I got a message?

14:56.334 --> 14:58.400
Well, ordinarily I
wouldn't take messages

14:58.434 --> 14:59.601
for a guy on strike,

14:59.634 --> 15:02.000
but this seemed like
a real important one.

15:02.033 --> 15:03.367
Well, what is it?

15:03.400 --> 15:07.167
Well, your agent called and said
you got a big shot at a movie,

15:07.200 --> 15:09.367
and the producers
are going to meet you

15:09.400 --> 15:11.200
at the Sherry-Netherland Hotel.

15:11.234 --> 15:12.167
Oh, wow! Oh, wow!

15:12.200 --> 15:13.501
What time do
I meet them?

15:13.534 --> 15:15.667
3:00 yesterday.

15:15.701 --> 15:17.100
Yesterday?

15:17.133 --> 15:19.734
Well, I would've given
it to you yesterday,

15:19.767 --> 15:22.901
but then I would have had
to cross the picket line.

15:22.934 --> 15:26.467
You know how I feel about
the sanctity of picket lines.

15:26.501 --> 15:28.100
You know, you only do this
to me, Louie,

15:28.133 --> 15:29.367
to try and make me break down,

15:29.400 --> 15:31.367
but you're not going
to get the satisfaction.

15:31.400 --> 15:33.200
All you're going to get
out of me is...

15:33.234 --> 15:35.200
( <i>whimpering</i> )

15:36.234 --> 15:38.167
TONY:
Great news, Bobby.

15:38.200 --> 15:40.701
What?
It better be great news.

15:40.734 --> 15:42.100
Oh, the union has agreed

15:42.133 --> 15:44.200
to hold a hearing
on our grievances.

15:44.234 --> 15:46.868
Yeah, they're gonna
subpoena Mackenzie...

15:46.901 --> 15:48.334
( <i>shivers</i> ) and Louie.

15:48.367 --> 15:49.667
ELAINE:
Isn't that great?

15:49.701 --> 15:51.601
It ain't going to do you
any good.

15:51.634 --> 15:53.067
Oh, yes, it is, Louie.

15:53.100 --> 15:55.067
Your back is
against the wall.

15:55.100 --> 15:57.734
We've got evidence
that is overwhelming.

15:57.767 --> 15:59.400
I'm used to this, Nardo.

15:59.434 --> 16:02.400
I am prepared for this
Mickey Mouse hearing.

16:02.434 --> 16:04.167
Prepared? Prepared, how?

16:04.200 --> 16:06.701
While you lame-os
are out there

16:06.734 --> 16:08.367
playing in the snow,

16:08.400 --> 16:12.767
I'm in here, doing a little
plastic surgery on the books.

16:12.801 --> 16:15.000
According to
these records,

16:15.033 --> 16:17.634
the Sunshine Cab Company
spends as much,

16:17.667 --> 16:20.667
if not more, money
on maintenance and repairs

16:20.701 --> 16:23.534
than any other cab company
in the city.

16:23.567 --> 16:25.767
Once they get a look
at these books,

16:25.801 --> 16:28.834
it will give us time to do
a little repairs on the cabs

16:28.868 --> 16:30.200
so they pass inspection.

16:30.234 --> 16:33.434
You see, you guys are
dealing with pros here.

16:33.467 --> 16:35.701
Hey, Louie, nobody's going
to be gullible enough

16:35.734 --> 16:37.434
to believe your story.

16:37.467 --> 16:38.968
Oh, no?

16:41.634 --> 16:42.934
Hey, Iggy.

16:42.968 --> 16:44.267
Yo.

16:44.300 --> 16:47.200
The Sunshine Cab Company
spends more on maintenance

16:47.234 --> 16:49.200
than any other
company in the city.

16:49.234 --> 16:51.701
Our strike worked.

16:53.200 --> 16:55.067
All power to the people!

16:55.100 --> 16:56.234
Well, we'll see, Louie.

16:56.267 --> 16:58.434
We'll just see
who they believe.

16:58.467 --> 17:00.400
Come on, guys, let's
get back to the line.

17:00.434 --> 17:02.501
Yeah.
Yeah.

17:02.534 --> 17:04.334
Farewell,
workers of the world.

17:04.367 --> 17:06.867
( <i>Bobby speaks indistinctly</i> )

17:08.800 --> 17:11.166
What are you hanging
around for, Rieger?

17:11.200 --> 17:12.733
A little scab city?

17:12.767 --> 17:14.000
That's quite a little trick

17:14.032 --> 17:16.067
you're trying to pull
with the books, Louie.

17:16.099 --> 17:19.467
Yeah, I got a few touches
in here that I'm proud of.

17:19.501 --> 17:21.467
One of them is...

17:21.501 --> 17:23.166
the Safety First picnic.

17:23.200 --> 17:26.334
Boy, did we eat a lot of
hot dogs at that picnic,

17:26.367 --> 17:29.167
but it was for a good cause.

17:29.200 --> 17:31.000
You really feel good
about this, don't you?

17:31.033 --> 17:32.467
Yeah.

17:32.501 --> 17:34.467
 I just hope
 <i>He</i> forgives you.

17:34.501 --> 17:37.467
Mackenzie? He's ready
to erect a statue to me.

17:37.501 --> 17:38.467
You kidding?

17:38.501 --> 17:39.834
No, no, no,
I don't mean Mackenzie.

17:39.868 --> 17:41.667
You know, when you walk
into that hearing room,

17:41.701 --> 17:42.868
you're going to be
under oath.

17:42.901 --> 17:44.200
Sure, sure.

17:44.234 --> 17:45.534
You know what that means?

17:45.567 --> 17:47.868
Yeah. It means they
got to believe you.

17:47.901 --> 17:50.367
I love this country.

17:51.400 --> 17:55.534
No, Lou, it means
that you'll be swearing to God

17:55.567 --> 17:57.033
to tell the truth,

17:57.067 --> 17:58.734
and then you'll lie.

18:04.200 --> 18:08.300
Well, every great businessman
has had to do that.

18:08.334 --> 18:10.000
Besides,

18:10.033 --> 18:12.167
he understands what's going on.

18:12.200 --> 18:13.901
He's a man of the world.

18:13.934 --> 18:15.834
Well, okay.

18:15.868 --> 18:17.667
It's okay with me...

18:17.701 --> 18:22.067
if the idea of eternal damnation
doesn't bother you.

18:22.100 --> 18:25.701
You had to bring
eternal damnation into it?

18:25.734 --> 18:28.801
Eternal damnation--
you're giving me that?

18:30.200 --> 18:35.167
I used to have a nun
in my parochial school--

18:35.200 --> 18:37.200
Sister Porchnik.

18:39.634 --> 18:42.868
She used to give pop quizzes
on eternal damnation.

18:42.901 --> 18:45.534
You know, Louie,

18:45.567 --> 18:48.534
someday, some driver is going
to go out of this garage

18:48.567 --> 18:51.868
in one of these cabs...

18:51.901 --> 18:55.033
and he's going
to get hurt, Lou.

18:55.067 --> 18:56.701
He may even be killed,

18:56.734 --> 18:58.534
and you'll be responsible.

18:58.567 --> 18:59.534
Not me.
You.
Not me.

18:59.567 --> 19:00.534
You.
It ain't me.

19:00.567 --> 19:01.701
You.
It ain't me.

19:01.734 --> 19:02.801
It's Mackenzie.

19:02.834 --> 19:04.133
He's the monster in here.

19:04.167 --> 19:06.767
He's responsible for everything
that goes on down here.

19:06.801 --> 19:08.133
Then Mackenzie
will be responsible

19:08.167 --> 19:11.767
for sending <i>you</i>
to eternal damnation.

19:14.300 --> 19:15.701
What am I going to do?

19:15.734 --> 19:17.300
Well, if I were you, Lou,

19:17.334 --> 19:20.133
I'd start negotiating
with our shop steward.

19:21.167 --> 19:23.167
All right.

19:23.200 --> 19:24.367
All right, send her in here.

19:24.400 --> 19:25.834
It will be a pleasure.

19:25.868 --> 19:27.968
You know what I hate
about you, Rieger?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.934
What's that?
You're always giving me

19:29.968 --> 19:32.133
that holier-than-thou attitude.

19:32.167 --> 19:33.334
Well, I'm sorry, Lou.

19:33.367 --> 19:35.868
It's just that thou art
so easy to be holier than.

19:45.133 --> 19:47.934
You wanted to see me?

19:47.968 --> 19:50.934
Nardo, you know
that I have the authority

19:50.968 --> 19:54.200
to end this strike
any way and as I see fit.

19:54.234 --> 19:55.534
I know that.

19:55.567 --> 19:57.467
Okay,
let's talk turkey here.

19:57.501 --> 19:59.334
Are you serious about this?

19:59.367 --> 20:00.501
Yeah.

20:00.534 --> 20:01.868
Yeah, I don't think
this strike

20:01.901 --> 20:03.033
should go on another day.

20:03.067 --> 20:05.667
It's-it's hard
on a lot of people.

20:05.701 --> 20:07.534
All right, Louie,
let's talk.

20:07.567 --> 20:09.767
Okay. All right,
you sit down

20:09.801 --> 20:13.467
and tell me specifically
what your demands are.

20:13.501 --> 20:15.801
Okay.

20:15.834 --> 20:18.367
We want you to
retire all cabs

20:18.400 --> 20:21.701
that have been in service
for over five years.

20:21.734 --> 20:24.434
We want new brakes on the cabs.

20:24.467 --> 20:26.100
We want you
to increase

20:26.133 --> 20:29.501
the maintenance budget
by at least ten percent,

20:29.534 --> 20:33.334
and we want at least one
new mechanic on each shift.

20:34.367 --> 20:37.167
All right, it's yours, Nardo.

20:37.200 --> 20:38.501
It is?
Yeah.

20:38.534 --> 20:40.334
You're going to give us
what we want?

20:41.367 --> 20:43.567
( <i>laughs</i> ) All right.

20:43.601 --> 20:44.901
Great.

20:44.934 --> 20:45.901
All right.

20:45.934 --> 20:47.834
Now, all you have to do

20:47.868 --> 20:50.701
is honor a few simple demands
of my own.

20:50.734 --> 20:53.801
Like what?

20:53.834 --> 20:56.334
Nothing bad. Nothing bad.

20:58.901 --> 21:03.868
You and me, for four days
in a mountain cabin,

21:03.901 --> 21:07.834
with no one but the furry
creatures of the woods

21:07.868 --> 21:10.534
to hear our screams
of ecstasy.

21:10.567 --> 21:12.701
One weekend.

21:12.734 --> 21:15.868
One date to save
cabbies' lives.

21:21.667 --> 21:24.467
You'd give in
to all of our demands

21:24.501 --> 21:26.834
if I go on one date with you?

21:26.868 --> 21:29.167
That's right, Elaine.

21:37.200 --> 21:39.767
Okay, it's luncheon.

21:39.801 --> 21:41.934
A lot of people around.

21:41.968 --> 21:44.100
We meet at the restaurant.

21:44.133 --> 21:46.267
We part at the restaurant.

21:46.300 --> 21:48.601
I get to bring a friend,

21:48.634 --> 21:51.968
and we sit
at separate tables.

21:56.200 --> 21:57.834
Fine. Fine.

21:57.868 --> 22:01.801
Let me-let me just alter
that just a tiny bit.

22:01.834 --> 22:03.801
It's at night.

22:03.834 --> 22:06.133
It's dinner.

22:06.167 --> 22:08.133
I pick you up.

22:08.167 --> 22:10.133
I take you home.

22:10.167 --> 22:12.968
It's just the two of us,

22:13.000 --> 22:15.968
and at some time
during the evening,

22:16.000 --> 22:19.801
within the hearing of at
least two other people,

22:19.834 --> 22:22.133
you must call me "Stallion."

22:29.000 --> 22:31.801
 And none of this--
 <i>none</i> of this--

22:31.834 --> 22:33.334
is negotiable.

22:33.367 --> 22:34.667
Except "Stallion."

22:34.701 --> 22:36.834
Especially "Stallion."

22:36.868 --> 22:39.634
Louie, isn't there any other way
we can settle this?

22:39.667 --> 22:41.901
Yeah, the only alternative
you have

22:41.934 --> 22:45.067
is to go into that hearing
with me and my books,

22:45.100 --> 22:48.534
and I make mincemeat
out of your case.

22:54.133 --> 22:57.767
Do you promise me that no one
will ever know about this?

22:57.801 --> 23:02.968
Are you suggesting we keep
our little tête-à-tête a secret

23:03.000 --> 23:05.934
from the eyes of a prying world?

23:05.968 --> 23:08.868
No. I'm suggesting that
if you let anyone know

23:08.901 --> 23:12.767
that I've debased myself,
I'll kill us both.

23:12.801 --> 23:14.934
Does that mean you'll do it?

23:15.968 --> 23:18.400
( <i>sighs</i> )

23:23.834 --> 23:25.834
( <i>sighs</i> )

23:25.868 --> 23:28.000
Yeah, I'll do it.

23:28.033 --> 23:29.267
( <i>whooping</i> )

23:29.300 --> 23:30.868
Oh, but, Louie, do you
know what you're doing?

23:30.901 --> 23:32.534
Do you realize...?
( <i>laughing</i> )

23:32.567 --> 23:34.834
You are using
my concern

23:34.868 --> 23:38.267
for my fellow workers and
friends to blackmail me.

23:38.300 --> 23:39.901
You're taking
advantage of something

23:39.934 --> 23:41.234
that's decent in me

23:41.267 --> 23:43.567
to satisfy some indecent
needs of your own.

23:43.601 --> 23:45.634
How does that
make you feel?

23:46.667 --> 23:48.734
Horny as all get out.

24:00.834 --> 24:03.667
( <i>theme music playing</i> )

24:27.767 --> 24:29.334
WOMAN:
Night, Mr. Walters.
