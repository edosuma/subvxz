00:31.448 --> 00:32.741
Koshiro!

00:33.783 --> 00:35.493
You're Koshiro, right?

00:38.038 --> 00:39.414
Say something.

00:52.177 --> 00:53.845
Physically, they said I'm fine.

00:54.721 --> 00:55.930
Kaga.

01:07.984 --> 01:09.194
What about my body?

01:11.154 --> 01:12.113
About that...

01:13.239 --> 01:14.074
they said...

01:14.949 --> 01:16.910
he's still unconscious.

01:17.535 --> 01:18.995
What the hell is happening?

01:19.120 --> 01:20.413
We couldn't have switched!

01:20.789 --> 01:22.165
That's exactly what happened.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.168
I called her.

01:25.418 --> 01:27.253
There is no mistaking it,

01:27.587 --> 01:29.297
Mizumoto is in your body.

01:29.380 --> 01:31.091
So why am I awake but he's not?

01:31.174 --> 01:33.468
This isn't a unique occurrence.

01:35.095 --> 01:38.181
In the past, some people
were asleep for years.

01:39.724 --> 01:40.558
Then...

01:41.434 --> 01:44.395
-What if they didn't wake up?
-Don't worry.

01:45.063 --> 01:46.523
That has never happened.

01:51.236 --> 01:52.904
May I ask you a question?

01:59.494 --> 02:00.829
Why did you switch?

02:01.996 --> 02:02.831
Huh?

02:03.665 --> 02:06.167
If one of you
didn't want to become the other,

02:06.459 --> 02:08.002
then it wouldn't have worked.

02:16.594 --> 02:17.512
I don't know.

02:18.847 --> 02:19.681
Then...

02:20.265 --> 02:21.432
Koshiro wanted to...

02:23.309 --> 02:24.602
At any rate,

02:24.727 --> 02:26.855
there's only one thing
we know for certain.

02:30.233 --> 02:31.067
You...

02:31.985 --> 02:33.820
can never return to normal.

02:42.495 --> 02:43.830
<i>This is my fault.</i>

02:48.459 --> 02:51.129
<i>Kaga and Koshiro switching...</i>

02:52.255 --> 02:53.173
<i>all of this...</i>

02:54.382 --> 02:55.758
<i>is my fault.</i>

03:10.315 --> 03:12.108
<i>Kaga and Koshiro...</i>

03:13.318 --> 03:14.319
Koshiro?

03:14.944 --> 03:15.778
What's wrong?

03:17.906 --> 03:19.032
<i>will never...</i>

03:19.949 --> 03:21.534
No, nothing's wrong.

03:23.661 --> 03:25.163
<i>be themselves again.</i>

04:44.242 --> 04:45.576
I'm worried about Ayumi!

04:45.660 --> 04:48.329
How was she? You saw her, right?

04:48.997 --> 04:50.081
I told them!

04:50.164 --> 04:52.083
Not to trust Koshiro Mizumoto!

04:52.166 --> 04:54.210
If you had stopped them,
they wouldn't have--

04:54.294 --> 04:55.336
Hey!

04:55.461 --> 04:57.255
I'm trying to talk here!
Let me out!

04:57.338 --> 04:58.589
It's not my bedtime yet!

04:58.673 --> 04:59.632
Damn you!

05:16.816 --> 05:18.860
<i>When I was at my lowest,</i>

05:19.736 --> 05:22.947
<i>the person who stayed beside me</i>
<i>and lifted me up</i>

05:23.323 --> 05:24.615
<i>was Kaga.</i>

05:25.491 --> 05:26.367
Let's have a look.

05:26.451 --> 05:27.660
See? Not bad.

05:30.872 --> 05:31.706
<i>Now,</i>

05:33.791 --> 05:35.126
<i>it's my turn.</i>

05:37.253 --> 05:38.338
Kaga!

05:41.049 --> 05:43.384
Here's the math homework.
You didn't do it, right?

05:45.511 --> 05:46.512
Oh, and here.

05:46.846 --> 05:48.556
If you get hungry.

05:51.851 --> 05:54.812
And if there's anything else you need,
you just let me know!

06:04.030 --> 06:04.947
Thanks.

06:05.239 --> 06:06.574
Are you serious?!

06:07.784 --> 06:08.868
When did this happen?

06:08.951 --> 06:10.328
Weren't you dating Ayumi?

06:10.411 --> 06:12.747
Does that mean he's moved on to Umine?

06:13.623 --> 06:14.665
No!

06:14.749 --> 06:16.501
It's not what it looks like!

06:16.584 --> 06:18.044
<i>Them together?</i>

06:19.003 --> 06:20.254
<i>How moronic.</i>

06:20.713 --> 06:22.590
<i>They don't look good together at all.</i>

06:22.673 --> 06:23.925
But,

06:24.008 --> 06:25.760
I kind of get the appeal.

06:26.094 --> 06:28.513
I mean, Umine has gotten cute.

06:28.596 --> 06:29.430
Totally!

06:29.514 --> 06:31.891
Recently, I've come to really like Umine!

06:45.655 --> 06:46.739
To me,

06:47.323 --> 06:51.202
-Umine is the cutest as she is now.
-Recently, I've come to really like Umine!

06:51.285 --> 06:53.162
I mean, Umine has gotten cute.

07:11.597 --> 07:12.432
Ayumi?

07:18.813 --> 07:19.730
Are you all right?

07:22.316 --> 07:23.151
-I'm fine.
-But--

07:23.234 --> 07:24.694
I said I'm fine!

07:37.331 --> 07:39.709
Umine is really popular now.

07:39.792 --> 07:40.835
I'm so jealous!

07:40.918 --> 07:42.920
-When did you start dating?
-How'd it happen?

07:43.004 --> 07:45.047
Ayumi's been acting different lately.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.841
Yeah, she wasn't like that before.

07:46.924 --> 07:48.551
That's why you broke up, right?

07:48.634 --> 07:50.428
I told you it's not what you think.

07:50.511 --> 07:51.512
Then what's going on?

07:51.596 --> 07:53.723
Stop! I'm telling you, from the start--

08:19.373 --> 08:21.167
We don't have to invite her, right?

08:21.250 --> 08:23.669
I'm embarrassed to be seen with her.

08:23.753 --> 08:26.214
Loser has to touch Umine!

08:26.297 --> 08:27.965
He actually touched her!

08:46.359 --> 08:50.112
AKATSUKI GENERAL HOSPITAL

08:59.121 --> 09:02.416
SHUNPEI KAGA

09:20.268 --> 09:21.185
Koshiro?

09:31.028 --> 09:32.697
Why did you change with Kaga?

09:36.617 --> 09:39.078
I didn't want to die,
so I switched instinctively.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.590
But this might be a better result.

09:53.926 --> 09:56.012
I've taken over Kaga's life.

09:58.347 --> 09:59.640
My wish came true.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.435
This isn't good at all--

10:02.518 --> 10:03.352
I...

10:04.437 --> 10:06.897
look like Kaga,
someone you hate, but...

10:09.358 --> 10:10.818
you'll stay with me, right?

10:14.280 --> 10:16.991
Looking different on the outside
won't change what's inside.

10:36.135 --> 10:36.969
Shit.

10:37.845 --> 10:38.721
I'm sorry.

10:39.138 --> 10:40.890
What do you have to be sorry about?

10:41.932 --> 10:43.267
The reason it all started.

10:43.976 --> 10:45.978
I'm responsible for all of it.

10:46.562 --> 10:47.396
Huh? That day,

10:51.442 --> 10:53.152
if I hadn't fallen for their trick... I want you to go to the art room.

10:55.738 --> 10:57.531
I want to talk to you one more time.

10:58.032 --> 10:59.450
Too bad.

11:02.912 --> 11:03.746
Oh, it hurts.

11:03.954 --> 11:05.373
Owie, owie! Kaga, what's wrong?!

11:07.500 --> 11:08.459
Cupcake...

11:09.585 --> 11:10.961
Did it taste weird?

11:11.045 --> 11:12.463
I don't normally bake--

11:12.546 --> 11:13.673
I want another one.

11:14.548 --> 11:15.383
Huh?

11:17.593 --> 11:19.178
Next time with raisins, please.

11:21.389 --> 11:22.223
Kaga...

11:23.849 --> 11:25.184
It's not your fault. You were the victim to start.

11:30.106 --> 11:32.233
I'll be good and do my own homework today.

11:33.317 --> 11:34.151
See ya.

12:09.478 --> 12:10.438
<i>Kaga...</i>

12:12.106 --> 12:14.024
<i>can't return to his true body.</i>

12:15.234 --> 12:16.777
She said it's a misunderstanding!

12:16.861 --> 12:18.904
I promise I'll get your body back!

12:18.988 --> 12:22.324
It doesn't matter what you look like.
I'll always be on your side.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.201
For now, focus on yourself.

12:24.410 --> 12:27.163
No matter what,
I'll be rooting for you.

12:28.372 --> 12:30.791
<i>Kaga went so far to protect me.</i>

12:30.875 --> 12:31.709
I like you, Ayumi.

12:33.127 --> 12:34.044
To me,

12:34.128 --> 12:35.588
Umine's cutest as she is now.

12:35.671 --> 12:38.549
More than anyone else,
I like the Ayumi with me here now.

12:39.842 --> 12:40.885
<i>But I...</i>

12:42.052 --> 12:44.263
<i>couldn't do a thing to protect him.</i>

12:46.348 --> 12:47.850
I would discover your kindness

12:48.184 --> 12:50.186
faster than anyone else.

12:52.813 --> 12:53.856
<i>Why?</i>

12:56.108 --> 12:58.235
<i>Why did it turn out like this?</i>

14:01.048 --> 14:01.882
What's going on? Ayumi,

14:06.887 --> 14:08.472
you can smack him if you want.

14:08.806 --> 14:09.640
What?

14:10.599 --> 14:12.560
He's been deceiving us this whole time.

14:14.812 --> 14:15.855
Koshiro...

14:17.231 --> 14:20.901
purposely stayed with Umine
to find a way to bring you back to normal.

14:26.657 --> 14:27.491
No way... Ayumi,

14:33.080 --> 14:34.999
I am so sorry for hurting you.

14:40.337 --> 14:41.589
Let's get our bodies back.

14:44.592 --> 14:45.718
Our families,

14:46.760 --> 14:48.178
our lives until now...

14:50.389 --> 14:51.724
we'll take it all back.

14:58.814 --> 14:59.773
Kaga...

15:04.653 --> 15:05.654
Koshiro...

15:19.543 --> 15:20.586
Don't cry.

15:41.732 --> 15:43.275
You'll stay with me, right?

15:43.567 --> 15:46.070
Looking different outside
won't change what's inside.

15:48.656 --> 15:49.573
<i>Was that meant...</i>

15:52.159 --> 15:53.911
<i>to spite me?</i>

15:57.331 --> 15:58.916
Umine is cutest as she is now.

15:58.999 --> 16:02.252
Recently, I've come to really like Umine!

16:02.503 --> 16:05.005
<i>Despite having Ayumi Kohinata's body,</i>

16:06.799 --> 16:09.176
<i>nothing changes for me.</i>

16:29.571 --> 16:31.824
Food is still tasty
no matter whose body I'm in.

16:35.577 --> 16:36.745
Hey, Koshiro,

16:37.246 --> 16:38.998
you faked everything, right?

16:39.623 --> 16:40.874
-Yeah.
-Then...

16:41.333 --> 16:43.210
why did you fall with Kaga?

16:47.297 --> 16:48.298
Ayumi,

16:49.299 --> 16:50.217
Sorry.

16:51.093 --> 16:52.469
But actually...

16:52.970 --> 16:53.971
<i>Stop!</i>

16:54.513 --> 16:56.432
Listen to me! Those two are watching.

17:00.269 --> 17:01.145
You...

17:01.228 --> 17:03.022
-You can't be serious!
-I am.

17:03.605 --> 17:05.024
I found a way to restore Ayumi.

17:06.025 --> 17:06.859
But...

17:07.568 --> 17:09.111
we must genuinely risk our lives.

17:09.194 --> 17:10.029
What do you mean?!

17:10.112 --> 17:10.946
First...

17:11.613 --> 17:12.990
you need to fall with me.

17:13.073 --> 17:14.241
-What?!
-We're switching!

17:14.324 --> 17:16.493
Explain it properly!

17:16.577 --> 17:17.411
Kaga!

17:19.496 --> 17:20.581
Do you trust me?

17:30.257 --> 17:32.051
But he wouldn't wake up.

17:32.634 --> 17:34.762
I didn't know what to do myself.

17:35.345 --> 17:36.388
That's why

17:37.014 --> 17:39.058
I didn't tell you anything.

17:40.142 --> 17:40.976
Sorry.

17:42.352 --> 17:45.689
But there shouldn't be a way
to get my body back.

17:45.773 --> 17:48.150
That's what I thought, too.

17:49.318 --> 17:50.152
But...

17:51.111 --> 17:52.696
there is one way.

17:53.572 --> 17:54.656
A shuffle?

17:54.740 --> 17:57.117
If you can't switch
with the same person twice,

17:57.201 --> 17:59.828
then you should just
pass through another person.

18:00.287 --> 18:01.288
What does that mean?

18:05.250 --> 18:06.585
<i>This is our current state.</i>

18:07.169 --> 18:09.421
<i>First, during the next Red Moon,</i>

18:09.505 --> 18:12.299
<i>Kaga and Ayumi will switch,</i>
<i>and I'll switch with Umine.</i>

18:12.883 --> 18:14.635
<i>Then when the next Red Moon comes,</i>

18:14.760 --> 18:17.679
<i>I'll switch with Ayumi,</i>
<i>and Kaga will switch with Umine.</i>

18:17.930 --> 18:18.972
<i>Then finally...</i>

18:19.348 --> 18:21.350
<i>Oh! We'll all be back to normal!</i>

18:21.517 --> 18:23.602
<i>Right. With the second Red Moon,</i>

18:23.685 --> 18:26.396
<i>we'll have switched without</i>
<i>going through the same person.</i>

18:26.480 --> 18:27.981
Koshiro, that's amazing!

18:28.065 --> 18:29.274
But Koshiro,

18:30.484 --> 18:31.777
this still wouldn't work.

18:32.277 --> 18:33.112
Why?

18:33.195 --> 18:34.822
-Zenko Umine!
-What?

18:34.905 --> 18:37.199
All four need to cooperate
for the shuffle to work.

18:38.033 --> 18:41.120
But I don't think she'll accept this
without a fight.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.123
You're right.

18:45.207 --> 18:46.583
Convincing her won't be easy.

18:46.667 --> 18:47.709
So what's your plan?

18:50.629 --> 18:52.798
We have no choice
but to trick her into it.

18:55.134 --> 18:55.968
Did you...

18:56.385 --> 18:58.637
stay by Umine having predicted that far?

19:02.141 --> 19:04.351
I think now I can make her
do anything.

19:13.318 --> 19:14.403
Hey...

19:19.241 --> 19:21.994
do you think we can just
have her cooperate?

19:24.496 --> 19:25.330
Huh?

19:26.081 --> 19:28.125
I know it'll be hard,

19:28.292 --> 19:29.209
but...

19:29.793 --> 19:34.214
if we lie to force her to change back,
who knows what will happen to her.

19:35.841 --> 19:37.801
Even if we're okay,

19:39.094 --> 19:43.056
Umine's heart will certainly
break into pieces.

19:53.066 --> 19:53.901
Ayumi,

19:55.736 --> 19:57.321
I can understand how you feel,

19:58.280 --> 20:01.200
but if she betrays us,
one of us could die.

20:04.786 --> 20:05.871
Besides,

20:07.414 --> 20:09.374
this plan is the hardest on Koshiro.

20:09.833 --> 20:12.294
He's the one who has to stay with Umine.

20:16.840 --> 20:17.674
Sorry.

20:20.636 --> 20:21.595
You're right.

20:28.101 --> 20:29.061
Thank you.

20:30.145 --> 20:32.105
See you tomorrow.

20:32.648 --> 20:33.482
Yeah.

20:54.002 --> 20:54.878
Koshiro.

20:57.881 --> 20:59.424
Hard to be the villian.

21:01.510 --> 21:02.344
Nope.

21:05.430 --> 21:07.599
You were right there for Ayumi.

21:10.227 --> 21:11.061
In that case,

21:12.020 --> 21:13.855
you support Ayumi.

21:14.064 --> 21:15.649
Wait, so you also--

21:15.774 --> 21:16.608
All I did...

21:21.029 --> 21:22.114
was put you in charge.

21:24.241 --> 21:27.411
I was also a reason for why
Umine stole Ayumi's body.

21:28.412 --> 21:29.246
That's why...

21:31.206 --> 21:32.666
no matter what the sacrifice,

21:33.917 --> 21:36.003
I resolved to return Ayumi to normal.

21:44.136 --> 21:44.970
Later.

22:10.787 --> 22:13.040
THE CURSED HOUSE

22:29.264 --> 22:32.476
GO TO THE CLASSROOM.
WHEN YOU FIND AYUMI, OPEN THE CURTAIN.

22:47.699 --> 22:50.327
-Are you going to date Kaga?
-What?

22:51.620 --> 22:52.913
I've always thought

22:53.830 --> 22:55.374
that you two matched better.

22:56.041 --> 22:57.584
You support Ayumi.

23:01.088 --> 23:02.339
We trust you.

23:03.006 --> 23:06.968
I don't know what you're planning to do,

23:07.344 --> 23:11.515
but we trust you.

23:17.687 --> 23:19.147
How stupid can you be?

24:24.421 --> 24:25.547
Welcome home.

24:33.889 --> 24:36.516
You used to help me like that before.

24:40.812 --> 24:43.607
You couldn't reach the counter,

24:44.024 --> 24:46.860
so you'd try your hardest
to pull out the stepstool.

24:49.446 --> 24:50.697
Mommy.

24:51.865 --> 24:53.533
I'll wash the dishes.

24:53.617 --> 24:56.328
You're going to help me? Thank you!

24:56.411 --> 24:57.412
Yup!

24:59.456 --> 25:01.666
I love washing dishes.

25:01.750 --> 25:03.335
I'm going to do my best.

25:03.960 --> 25:05.587
That makes me so happy.

25:06.421 --> 25:08.423
Good job.

25:10.717 --> 25:12.135
You and I,

25:12.969 --> 25:15.263
if we were born slightly more beautiful,

25:16.389 --> 25:19.267
maybe life would have been
a little better.

25:50.924 --> 25:51.758
Umine?

25:53.593 --> 25:54.761
Koshiro.

25:59.808 --> 26:00.642
I'll...

26:01.685 --> 26:02.894
accept you.

26:05.855 --> 26:06.731
Even though...

26:09.401 --> 26:11.903
I stole Ayumi Kohinata's body,

26:13.613 --> 26:16.241
I couldn't become Ayumi Kohinata.

26:18.743 --> 26:20.120
I will accept you...

26:22.706 --> 26:23.873
so please...

26:25.875 --> 26:28.128
don't leave me alone.

26:36.261 --> 26:39.347
Koshiro, let me love you.

27:05.540 --> 27:07.542
INCOMING GROUP CALL

27:10.128 --> 27:12.172
CONNECTING GROUP CALL

27:12.756 --> 27:13.590
Hello?

27:13.673 --> 27:14.799
Hello.

27:16.176 --> 27:18.928
I thought what we should do
about Umine again.

27:19.054 --> 27:19.888
Huh?

27:20.221 --> 27:22.932
I think we should be upfront
with her after all.

27:24.059 --> 27:24.976
Koshiro... <i>Wait a minute.</i>

27:26.061 --> 27:28.188
You're going to tell her everything?

27:28.271 --> 27:29.105
<i>Yeah.</i>

27:30.315 --> 27:31.983
<i>And I want her to join us.</i>

27:32.067 --> 27:34.903
We decided to trick her
because that's too hard.

27:34.986 --> 27:35.987
But in doing so,

27:37.739 --> 27:39.991
it would be the same
as what she did to Ayumi.

27:44.871 --> 27:47.290
Who cares if she gets a taste
of her own medicine?

27:47.374 --> 27:48.792
I thought so, too.

27:50.627 --> 27:51.461
But...

27:54.005 --> 27:55.757
we can't make Umine suffer more. Why are you saying this now?

27:59.386 --> 28:00.762
There's no room for pity--

28:00.887 --> 28:01.721
Kaga.

28:04.265 --> 28:05.475
Please...

28:06.476 --> 28:07.894
for me.

28:21.074 --> 28:22.033
All right.

28:26.079 --> 28:29.249
Besides, no matter what I say,
it's already been decided.

28:29.791 --> 28:30.917
Sorry, Kaga. Thank you.

28:34.087 --> 28:34.921
Yeah.

28:35.630 --> 28:37.382
Somehow, I will figure out...

28:38.717 --> 28:40.176
how to convince Umine.

28:42.345 --> 28:43.179
Okay.

29:03.825 --> 29:04.909
Oh, crap!

29:07.328 --> 29:10.707
There you are!
Hurry and eat or you'll be late.

29:10.790 --> 29:13.376
<i>...we know the change in terrain</i>
<i>is responsible</i>

29:13.460 --> 29:15.962
<i>for shortening</i>
<i>the Red Moon's appearance cycle.</i>

29:17.130 --> 29:17.964
<i>Unfortunately...</i> We need to talk.

29:58.338 --> 29:59.464
Ayumi!

29:59.839 --> 30:00.840
Where's Koshiro?!

30:01.508 --> 30:02.801
On the roof with Umine.

30:04.969 --> 30:06.221
-We gotta stop him.
-Huh?

30:06.304 --> 30:08.556
If Umine refuses,
we might not go back to normal!

30:08.973 --> 30:09.808
What do you mean?

30:10.225 --> 30:11.559
Ms. Ukon said so.

30:11.810 --> 30:14.312
<i>If the cycle continues</i>
<i>to shorten at this rate,</i>

30:14.687 --> 30:16.731
<i>in two days and also one week later</i>

30:16.815 --> 30:20.568
<i>will be the last times</i>
<i>the Red Moon will appear.</i>

30:21.444 --> 30:22.529
Hold on!

30:23.196 --> 30:25.532
For the shuffle,
we need at least two Red Moons.

30:25.615 --> 30:29.369
We gotta trick her into it or something
by the next Red Moon or else!

30:51.182 --> 30:53.476
What did you want to talk about?

31:08.700 --> 31:09.534
I'm sorry.

31:11.995 --> 31:13.496
I've been lying to you.

31:18.042 --> 31:19.586
I was dating you because...

31:41.232 --> 31:42.066
Koshiro!

31:45.695 --> 31:46.905
Where's Umine?

31:59.918 --> 32:00.752
Idiot!

32:01.252 --> 32:02.837
Chase her down! There's no time!

32:02.921 --> 32:03.922
Look.

32:04.005 --> 32:05.173
LAST RED MOON NEXT WEEK

32:05.798 --> 32:07.008
Understand? Let's go!

32:09.636 --> 32:10.845
What are you doing?!

32:14.641 --> 32:15.892
Let's wait one more day.

32:16.267 --> 32:18.519
-What?!
-Changing how you look doesn't matter.

32:19.395 --> 32:21.272
The one who understands that the most

32:21.522 --> 32:22.815
is Umine herself.

32:24.192 --> 32:25.944
And what if she refuses?

32:26.444 --> 32:28.154
-I believe in her.
-I'm telling you.

32:28.237 --> 32:29.739
This isn't the time to be--

32:29.822 --> 32:31.115
Kaga!

32:43.962 --> 32:44.796
Fine!

32:47.799 --> 32:49.717
"Please, for me."

32:50.718 --> 32:51.552
Right?

33:07.735 --> 33:08.653
<i>And so,</i> <i>the next day came.</i>

33:11.739 --> 33:12.615
<i>On that day,</i>

33:13.700 --> 33:15.159
<i>it rained from the morning.</i>

33:18.663 --> 33:22.583
<i>If we can't persuade Umine by the time</i>
<i>the Red Moon comes tomorrow,</i>

33:22.917 --> 33:25.086
<i>we can never go back to normal.</i>

33:26.504 --> 33:27.338
<i>But...</i>

33:28.256 --> 33:29.549
Take your seats!

33:32.510 --> 33:35.763
Before we start homeroom,
I have an important announcement.

33:38.224 --> 33:39.267
As of yesterday,

33:39.934 --> 33:41.894
Ayumi Kohinata has gone missing.

33:57.994 --> 33:58.828
Umine...
