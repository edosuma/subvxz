01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:19.960
- Uh, but, like, really, really soon.
- No, no, no.

01:18:20.002 --> 01:18:24.708
No, no, no. Now's fine. Um...

01:18:24.750 --> 01:18:26.790
Do whatever you need to do.

01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:33.458

- Yeah.

No.

You guys are always
going off in a huddle,

01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:44.838
whispering your girl talk
stuff or whatever,

01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:47.628
and Jay and I are tired of it.

01:18:47.670 --> 01:18:48.830
I'm not.

01:18:51.620 --> 01:18:53.498
We're your family, too.

01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:57.838
We've been through
a lot together.

01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:02.708
We're not stopping
that now, okay?

01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:04.790

to start girl talk.

01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:30.620
Um, well...

01:19:33.670 --> 01:19:37.708
I'm a mess. I'm such a mess.

01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:44.628
(VOICE BREAKING) I mean, six
months ago, I was, you know,

01:19:44.670 --> 01:19:47.538
stealing candy
from babies, and now

01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:49.578
everybody wants me to be
this Lady of the Court.

01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:53.578
And I have no idea
how to keep up the act.

01:19:53.620 --> 01:19:54.838
Then don't.

01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:56.748
See? This was dumb.

01:19:56.790 --> 01:20:00.668
Maybe it wasn't.

01:20:00.710 --> 01:20:03.540
We're always gonna be
the kids from the Isle.

01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:06.458
I tried to forget it.

01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:09.830
I really tried,
but those are our roots.

01:20:12.460 --> 01:20:17.418
And we all did what
we had to do to survive.

01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:20.578
But it made us who we are.

01:20:20.620 --> 01:20:24.418
And we're never gonna be
like anybody else here.

01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:27.708
And that's okay. That's okay.

01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:29.538
And we can't fake it.

01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:31.338
No.

01:20:31.380 --> 01:20:34.418
Yeah. I mean, especially
without my spell book.

01:20:34.460 --> 01:20:37.418
Mal, if Ben doesn't
love the real you,

01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:39.708
then he's not the one.

01:20:39.750 --> 01:20:42.338
I like that.

01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:43.580
Give him a chance.

01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:48.628

changes to your dress.

Only if you're up for it...

and you can't stand another day,

I'll drive you
back tomorrow myself.

You all know I come
from the Isle, right,

01:22:10.330 --> 01:22:11.530
where things are pretty whack.

01:22:11.572 --> 01:22:14.418
(CHUCKLES) No,
but there is one thing

01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:16.378

- No.

Because let me tell you,
he is not as happy as his dad.

Kind of a dark streak, in fact.

on the Isle.

to have been given a chance,

01:24:06.170 --> 01:24:10.128

someone else a chance, too.

hate me by the end of it, um,

01:25:02.380 --> 01:25:08.248
would you consider maybe
being more than friends?

01:25:08.290 --> 01:25:11.128
- Maybe?
- Like boyfriend and girlfriend?

01:25:11.170 --> 01:25:13.288
Where we can hold hands instead of
slugging each other all the time?

01:25:13.330 --> 01:25:15.208
And we can text, and I can
tell you how great you are?

01:25:15.250 --> 01:25:16.458

really, really great.
