09:00.801 --> 09:03.107
- Look, man,
I've seen your rap sheet.

09:03.151 --> 09:04.587
You have
an outstanding warrant.

09:04.631 --> 09:07.024
You really wanna tack on
a kidnapping charge?

09:07.068 --> 09:08.417
Huh?

09:08.460 --> 09:10.854
A jury would not blink
to convict a guy like you,

09:10.898 --> 09:12.813
someone who abuses his own kid.

09:12.856 --> 09:16.120
- I never abused my kid, ever!

09:16.164 --> 09:18.122
I never touched
that little girl either.

09:21.343 --> 09:23.563
But I may have seen
the guy that did.

09:23.606 --> 09:25.347
- Okay.

09:25.390 --> 09:27.305
Would you like to tell us
what happened,

09:27.349 --> 09:29.656
what you saw?

09:29.699 --> 09:32.528
- Yeah, she was with some man
out in the woods,

09:32.572 --> 09:35.313
and, uh...

09:35.357 --> 09:37.794
he was pulling her by her arm.

09:37.838 --> 09:39.404
I saw her
with her family earlier.

09:39.448 --> 09:40.580
I knew where she lived,

09:40.623 --> 09:43.452
so I went there
to see what was going on,

09:43.495 --> 09:44.714
but when I got there,

09:44.758 --> 09:47.674
I saw that the parents
were panicking, and...

09:47.717 --> 09:49.719
I knew they were gonna
call the cops, so...

09:49.763 --> 09:51.591
I didn't want nothing
to do with it.

09:51.634 --> 09:53.636
- Well, that is very noble
of you, sir.

09:53.680 --> 09:54.681
- You said that
you saw the girl

09:54.724 --> 09:56.204
outside of the cabin
in the woods?

09:56.247 --> 09:57.466
Where?

09:57.509 --> 09:59.163
- Down by the pond.

09:59.207 --> 10:01.470
I heard them there...

10:01.513 --> 10:02.602
But I kept back.

10:02.645 --> 10:04.255
I stayed out of sight,
and I saw the guy.

10:04.299 --> 10:05.648
He, uh...

10:05.692 --> 10:07.650
he was struggling
with the girl,

10:07.694 --> 10:09.217
and she didn't want
nothing to do with him.

10:09.260 --> 10:10.522
- Did you get
a good look at him?

10:10.566 --> 10:12.786
- It was too dark.

10:17.094 --> 10:18.530
- According to park maps,

10:18.574 --> 10:20.184
there's a utility road
on the north side of the pond.

10:20.228 --> 10:21.882
So if Kirkpatrick's
telling the truth,

10:21.925 --> 10:25.450
then the kidnapper could've
been taking Grace to a car.

10:26.713 --> 10:28.628
- Looks like someone
was headed this way.

10:28.671 --> 10:31.021
Can we get a marker over here?

10:31.065 --> 10:33.023

11:31.691 --> 11:33.954
We're gonna need
a dive team out here.

11:38.698 --> 11:41.613
- All right, dive team
has started a grid search

11:41.657 --> 11:43.615
on the pond,
but in the meantime,

11:43.659 --> 11:46.096

So in the spirit of optimism,
let's keep working.

11:49.099 --> 11:50.448
What do we have?

11:50.492 --> 11:52.233
- Lab says
the shoe print Scola found

11:52.276 --> 11:53.930
isn't distinct enough
to run down.

11:53.974 --> 11:55.453
It's a size 12.

11:55.497 --> 11:57.455
That's three sizes too large
to be Don Kirkpatrick's.

11:57.499 --> 11:59.240
- Which means there was
someone else out there.

11:59.283 --> 12:00.241
- Yeah, well,
they're gonna book him

12:00.284 --> 12:01.459
on the outstanding warrant,

12:01.503 --> 12:03.461
but ERT didn't find
any evidence in his tent

12:03.505 --> 12:05.637
or in the area
where Maggie apprehended him.

12:05.681 --> 12:07.378
It doesn't seem like
he was involved.

12:07.422 --> 12:08.815
- Mm.

12:08.858 --> 12:10.077
- We can confirm the blood
on the rock is Grace's.

12:10.120 --> 12:12.253
It matched to the DNA
from the toothbrush.

12:12.296 --> 12:14.081
- Right.

12:14.124 --> 12:16.474
Anything from the doll?
- Two latent prints.

12:16.518 --> 12:18.041
One of a child's,
presumably Grace's.

12:18.085 --> 12:20.522
The other of her father's,
Ben Harris.

12:20.565 --> 12:21.566
- So that's a dead end.

12:21.610 --> 12:23.003
- Not necessarily.

12:23.046 --> 12:24.787
Something popped when
we ran her dad's fingerprints.

12:24.831 --> 12:28.008
- What do you mean?
- On the surface, Ben is clean.

12:28.051 --> 12:30.575
But he changed
his legal name 13 years ago.

12:30.619 --> 12:32.360
He has a sealed juvenile record

12:32.403 --> 12:35.015
and a past felony conviction.

12:35.058 --> 12:36.712
- For what?

12:36.756 --> 12:39.846
- Murder.

12:39.889 --> 12:42.500
When he was 12, he killed
a ten-year-old girl...

12:44.502 --> 12:47.070
In the woods.

12:47.114 --> 12:49.464
- Same crime, same location.

12:52.859 --> 12:54.599
Could just be
an ugly coincidence,

12:54.643 --> 12:56.993
but let's see what else
you can dig up!

13:00.301 --> 13:02.999
We need to know who this
little girl's father really is.

13:09.701 --> 13:11.834
- Ben Harris
was born Corbin Howard.

13:11.878 --> 13:12.879
He grew up in the Bronx.

13:12.922 --> 13:14.489
He was raised
by his grandmother

13:14.532 --> 13:16.883
until he was convicted
of murder as a juvenile.

13:16.926 --> 13:18.275
He was 12 years old.

13:18.319 --> 13:19.842
He spent six years
at the Horizon Juvenile Center

13:19.886 --> 13:20.974
in the Bronx.

13:21.017 --> 13:23.237
He was released
on his 18th birthday.

13:23.280 --> 13:25.587
- Well, that is
an odd coincidence,

13:25.630 --> 13:26.631
but we really think
it's relevant

13:26.675 --> 13:28.155
to his daughter's
disappearance?

13:28.198 --> 13:30.026
- Well, there are some
similarities between the cases.

13:30.070 --> 13:31.114
You wanna...

13:31.158 --> 13:32.333
- The victim's name
was Lucy Parkin.

13:32.376 --> 13:33.987
She and Ben went to
the same summer camp

13:34.030 --> 13:36.293
in the Catskills
in July of 2000,

13:36.337 --> 13:37.991
and witnesses said that,
on the day of the murder,

13:38.034 --> 13:40.602
he lured her deep into
the woods, away from the group,

13:40.645 --> 13:43.126
shoved her off
the side of a cliff.

13:43.170 --> 13:45.868
She fell 28 feet,
died a few hours later.

13:45.912 --> 13:47.000
- Okay.

13:47.043 --> 13:48.566
Is there any evidence

13:48.610 --> 13:50.525
that actually suggest he's
involved in this current case?

13:50.568 --> 13:52.005
- Well, nothing concrete,

13:52.048 --> 13:53.876
but he was the last person
to have contact with Grace

13:53.920 --> 13:55.617
before she went missing.

13:55.660 --> 13:57.314
And he also has a sealed
psychiatric record

13:57.358 --> 13:58.838
from his time
at Youth Authority.

13:58.881 --> 14:00.274
- Right.

14:00.317 --> 14:01.492
HIPAA laws prevent us
from seeing what was in it,

14:01.536 --> 14:02.885
but if he was struggling
with mental illness,

14:02.929 --> 14:06.628
being in the same environment
as the original trauma,

14:06.671 --> 14:09.370
it could've trigged him,
sent him down a dark path.

14:09.413 --> 14:10.414
- All right.

14:10.458 --> 14:12.025
Have Maggie and OA
go question him.

14:12.068 --> 14:13.765
- Yeah.

14:20.076 --> 14:22.296
- Hi.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.909
- No, he went out for a drive.

14:26.953 --> 14:28.215
He said he needed
to clear his head.

14:28.258 --> 14:29.520
- When did he leave?

14:29.564 --> 14:31.740
- About 45 minutes ago.
Is everything okay?

14:31.783 --> 14:33.481

14:33.524 --> 14:35.135

- It's a ransom demand.
"$200K by sundown or she dies."

18:17.183 --> 18:19.881
- Please.

18:19.924 --> 18:21.883
- Okay.

18:21.926 --> 18:23.972
Come on.
Get up.

18:26.844 --> 18:28.107
Okay, let's go.

18:33.590 --> 18:34.939
- All right, everybody,
listen up.

18:34.983 --> 18:37.072
We have a ransom demand
and a photo that proves

18:37.116 --> 18:40.119
Grace Harris was alive
when she left the campground.

18:40.162 --> 18:42.208
Looks like she has
a pretty nasty gash on her leg,

18:42.251 --> 18:44.340
which explains the bloody rock
at the crime scene.

18:44.384 --> 18:46.995
Otherwise, she appears
to be in good health--

18:47.038 --> 18:48.214
based on the photo, at least.

18:48.257 --> 18:50.477
- This is now
a targeted crime scene.

18:50.520 --> 18:52.783
The abductors knew
whose child they have

18:52.827 --> 18:54.133
and how much they can ask for.

18:54.176 --> 18:56.396
- The kidnapper
texted Ben Harris.

18:56.439 --> 18:58.441
So he has his cell number.

18:58.485 --> 19:00.748
- Yeah, but he had him ditch
his personal cell right away

19:00.791 --> 19:02.184
to avoid tracking.

19:02.228 --> 19:04.839
He sent him to park in
Haverstraw to pick up a burner.

19:04.882 --> 19:06.406
- That's the phone
the photo of the girl was on,

19:06.449 --> 19:07.929
the one they're using
to communicate with Ben.

19:07.972 --> 19:09.931
- And what about
the money drop?

19:09.974 --> 19:12.107
Timing? Location?
- Nothing yet.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.848
- Okay, so you guys'll
head up to Haverstraw

19:13.891 --> 19:15.197
and check the park for cameras,

19:15.241 --> 19:16.546
witnesses who might've seen
our perp

19:16.590 --> 19:19.419
dropping off the burner phone.

19:19.462 --> 19:21.725
- How about the burner itself?
Did we run it for prints?

19:21.769 --> 19:23.205
- Yeah, it's clean.

19:23.249 --> 19:25.729
- Except for Ben's.
But the messaging is encrypted.

19:25.773 --> 19:26.730
Cellular Survey is on-site

a lot to process, Ben,

19:34.347 --> 19:36.218
but from
an investigative perspective,

19:36.262 --> 19:38.916
proof of life in
a ransom demand is encouraging.

19:38.960 --> 19:40.483
- The kidnappers
want something, all right?

19:40.527 --> 19:41.919
So they're gonna need
to keep Grace safe to get it.

19:44.270 --> 19:46.663
- Why didn't you call us
after you got that text?

19:46.707 --> 19:48.578
- I was just
following instructions.

19:48.622 --> 19:51.712
It said not to tell anyone.

19:51.755 --> 19:54.758

didn't you?

19:54.802 --> 19:56.804
That I'd hurt my daughter?

19:58.371 --> 20:00.111
- Yes.

20:00.155 --> 20:02.375
But that's only because
most abduction cases

20:02.418 --> 20:05.073
are perpetrated by a parent...

20:05.116 --> 20:06.596
and, given
your criminal history,

20:06.640 --> 20:08.294
it raised a few red flags.

20:10.121 --> 20:11.688
- "Criminal history"?

20:14.169 --> 20:16.171
You're talking about
Lucy Parkin.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.955
- We had to consider it
a possibility.

20:17.999 --> 20:20.610
- Yeah, well,
it was an accident.

20:20.654 --> 20:22.395
I didn't mean
to kill that girl.

20:22.438 --> 20:24.135

we don't have time

I know...

20:29.228 --> 20:32.013
But I was at that camp
on a scholarship

20:32.056 --> 20:34.145

like a sore thumb,

26:02.952 --> 26:04.301

26:04.345 --> 26:05.607
- SNY records show

26:05.651 --> 26:07.217
that the same employee
swiped into the lot

26:07.261 --> 26:08.479

his dad started drinking,

26:36.290 --> 26:37.508
eventually died
of liver failure,

28:18.174 --> 28:20.046
I had nothing to do

28:27.793 --> 28:31.622

obsessed with this guy,

28:31.666 --> 28:33.276
Corbin Howard,

28:33.320 --> 28:34.800
the one who killed his sister.

28:34.843 --> 28:36.279
He talked about him
all the time,

28:36.323 --> 28:38.368
how he'd get back at him
if he ever saw him again.

28:38.412 --> 28:40.283
All that.

28:40.327 --> 28:41.458
But it was just a fantasy.

28:41.502 --> 28:43.765
Ray hadn't seen the guy
in 15 years

28:43.809 --> 28:45.027
until a few weeks ago.

28:45.071 --> 28:46.550
- What happened
a few weeks ago?

28:46.594 --> 28:50.119
- Uh, Ray was at the courthouse
for a parole hearing,

28:50.163 --> 28:52.165
came back saying
he saw the guy.

28:52.208 --> 28:53.644
Said he's a hotshot lawyer now

28:53.688 --> 28:55.908
and changed his name
like nothing ever happened.

28:55.951 --> 28:57.823
But he makes a lot of money,

28:57.866 --> 28:59.999
so Ray had this idea

29:00.042 --> 29:01.783
to kidnap his kid,
make him pay,

29:01.827 --> 29:03.002
but then things
got out of control.

29:03.045 --> 29:04.438
He started talking crazy, I--

29:04.481 --> 29:07.267
- Hang on, hang on, slow down.
Out of control how?

29:07.310 --> 29:09.486
- He started talking crazy
and took off with my car.

29:09.530 --> 29:12.185
- What kind of car?
- A Subaru Impreza, black.

29:13.752 --> 29:16.232
Look, I thought
it was just a money thing.

29:16.276 --> 29:18.408
I swear I didn't know
Ray was gonna kill the guy

29:18.452 --> 29:19.758
after he got paid.

29:26.155 --> 29:27.243
- That's the fourth time
he's called.

29:27.287 --> 29:28.984
Everything okay?
- It's fine.

29:29.028 --> 29:30.290
- I don't believe you.

29:30.333 --> 29:31.421

more important things

29:31.465 --> 29:32.858

29:32.901 --> 29:34.860
- One sec.

29:36.122 --> 29:37.819

29:37.863 --> 29:39.690
- What's going on?
You find something?

29:39.734 --> 29:41.736
- We need to talk
to you and your wife.

29:41.780 --> 29:42.998
- Do you know where Grace is?

29:43.042 --> 29:45.566
- No, we don't,
but can we come inside?

29:45.609 --> 29:47.350
- I don't think
that's a good idea.

29:47.394 --> 29:49.135
I thought we made this clear.

29:49.178 --> 29:50.963
We want to handle this
on our own.

29:51.006 --> 29:52.355
- Mr. Harris,

29:52.399 --> 29:54.705
we have evidence that
the kidnapper is Ray Parkin.

29:58.971 --> 30:01.364
- Lu--Lucy's brother.

30:01.408 --> 30:02.801
- Yes.

30:02.844 --> 30:04.411
- Mm-hmm.

30:09.503 --> 30:11.070
- That's not possible.

30:11.113 --> 30:12.593
How does he even know who I am?

30:12.636 --> 30:14.769
- Well, he saw you at
the courthouse a few weeks ago,

30:14.813 --> 30:16.466
tracked you down;
he's been stalking your family,

30:16.510 --> 30:18.164
and we think he followed you
to the cabin last night.

30:18.207 --> 30:19.861
- No, no, no, no.
I can't believe this.

30:19.905 --> 30:20.993
It's been 20 years.

30:21.036 --> 30:22.211
- Mr. Harris,
we'll do everything we can

30:22.255 --> 30:23.473
to protect your family,

30:23.517 --> 30:25.432
but we need you and your wife
to work with us.

30:25.475 --> 30:27.651
- No, no.

30:27.695 --> 30:29.566
I can handle it on my own.
Thank you.

30:29.610 --> 30:31.177
- Ben, this guy despises you.

30:31.220 --> 30:33.962
- But if I give him the money
and tell him what happened,

30:34.006 --> 30:35.355
how sorry--

30:35.398 --> 30:37.357
- Then he will probably
kill you and your daughter.

30:37.400 --> 30:39.620
That's the truth.

30:39.663 --> 30:41.056
Either way, we need
to sit down with Rhonda

30:41.100 --> 30:42.101
and explain the risks.
- No! No.

30:42.144 --> 30:43.450
She can't know about this.

30:43.493 --> 30:45.017
- That's not our problem.
- You said it earlier.

30:45.060 --> 30:46.801
It's not your decision.
I'm Grace's father.

30:46.845 --> 30:49.369
- And Rhonda is her mother,

30:49.412 --> 30:51.458

in how this goes down.

30:55.331 --> 30:57.638
We will not let you compromise
your daughter's safety

30:57.681 --> 30:59.466
to protect your secret.
- That's not...

31:01.555 --> 31:03.078
That's not what I'm doing.

31:03.122 --> 31:04.514
- Hmm.

31:06.429 --> 31:08.823
- I'm just trying
to get my daughter back.

31:08.867 --> 31:10.433
That's all.

31:10.477 --> 31:12.261
- Either you tell her,

31:12.305 --> 31:13.959
or I do.

31:21.444 --> 31:23.446
- Okay, fine.

31:23.490 --> 31:25.013
I'll do it.

31:28.147 --> 31:30.105
- How could you hide this
from me?

31:30.149 --> 31:32.107
- Rhonda, it was 20 years ago.
You--

31:32.151 --> 31:34.631

to exonerate you?

31:34.675 --> 31:37.069

31:37.112 --> 31:40.115
I wanted to move forward,
to leave it in the past.

31:40.159 --> 31:41.943
- It's not in the past, Ben!

31:41.987 --> 31:45.468
That girl's brother
kidnapped our daughter!

31:45.512 --> 31:47.340
- I don't know what to say.
I'm sorry.

31:47.383 --> 31:48.558
- Sorry?

31:48.602 --> 31:50.169
