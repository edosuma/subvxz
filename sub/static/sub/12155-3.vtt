WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.903
I think my wife's been having
an affair on the side.

00:03.940 --> 00:05.543
<i>I want you to figure out
what's going on.</i>

00:05.577 --> 00:07.183
You're cheating on me with him?

00:07.217 --> 00:09.624
This hard drive...
I need you to destroy it.

00:09.658 --> 00:13.270
I'd like our
relationship to be open.

00:13.304 --> 00:14.976
I feel really loved right now.

00:15.011 --> 00:17.516
- I'm ready for more than cuddling.
- Oh!

00:17.550 --> 00:19.788
I've had this terrific
pain inside of my penis.

00:19.823 --> 00:21.293
What do you think
would cause it?

00:21.328 --> 00:23.699
Off the top of my head,
I would say urethral scarring.

00:23.734 --> 00:25.471
- Leah.
- Who are you?

00:25.506 --> 00:27.142
I can't believe it's
only been three weeks.

00:27.177 --> 00:28.746
He's just a guy I met.

00:28.780 --> 00:31.587
<i>I'd like all of you

<i>- Hi.
- Hi.</i>

01:32.146 --> 01:33.514
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

01:33.549 --> 01:35.385
No problem.
I'm sorry.

01:35.419 --> 01:39.393
As a kid I always
used to love models.

01:39.427 --> 01:42.199
That's okay.
The models are there to be studied.

01:42.233 --> 01:45.905
So, George, I have
your test results.

01:45.940 --> 01:48.410
Is everything all right?
I mean, no STDs?

01:48.444 --> 01:52.082
You know, somehow I have managed
throughout the years not to get herpes.

01:52.117 --> 01:56.723
Although one time my lip exploded.
It was incredible.

01:56.757 --> 01:58.024
It was nice.

01:58.059 --> 02:00.461
No, no STDs, no herpes.

02:01.498 --> 02:03.199
All right, good.
Wonderful.

02:04.969 --> 02:08.306
You have stage ii prostate cancer.

02:10.443 --> 02:13.046
Oh, wow.

02:15.118 --> 02:16.919
Okay, all right, okay.

02:16.954 --> 02:19.657
All right, um...

02:21.261 --> 02:25.533
Is stage ii bad?

02:25.567 --> 02:27.636
- Well... - I mean, are
there a lot of stages?

02:27.671 --> 02:30.474
Is stage ii good?
Because I would like a od stage.

02:30.508 --> 02:34.447
There are four stages. It would have
been better to have caught it sooner,

02:34.481 --> 02:36.516
but it's still fairly early.

02:36.551 --> 02:38.085
Most likely
the best course of action

02:38.120 --> 02:40.556
will be to remove all
or part of the prostate.

02:40.590 --> 02:43.794
Ooh, "remove."

02:43.828 --> 02:46.565
Um, I've never had
anything removed before.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.735
I mean like my...
my appendix.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.404
My tonsils, wisdom teeth.

02:50.439 --> 02:52.841
I hold onto everything.
I'm like a...

02:52.876 --> 02:54.811
I'm like a hoarder, I guess.
But, um,

02:54.845 --> 02:56.380
I'm completely intact.

02:56.414 --> 02:58.750
I understand.
I have hoarding issues.

02:58.784 --> 03:00.352
My apartment is filled

03:00.387 --> 03:03.524
with plastic bags,
unread "new yorkers,"

03:03.558 --> 03:06.261
congealed bottles
of salad dressing.

03:10.601 --> 03:12.570
Sorry, I just...
I can't believe this.

03:12.604 --> 03:15.173
Um, okay, is, um,

03:15.207 --> 03:17.508
is that why I had
the pain in my penis?

03:17.542 --> 03:21.710
No, I think that was just a random
odd pain and not at all connected.

03:21.744 --> 03:24.344
George, I know this
is very difficult,

03:24.379 --> 03:27.848
but the mortality rates for prostate
cancer are very encouraging.

03:31.919 --> 03:35.021
Giuliani didn't die
from prostate cancer

03:35.055 --> 03:38.057
Joe torre didn't die.
Nobody seems to be dying from this.

03:38.091 --> 03:41.059
I don't want to scare you, but
some people do die, George.

03:41.094 --> 03:43.928
That's why we're gonna do
everything we can to help you.

03:43.962 --> 03:45.896
Oh my God.

03:47.965 --> 03:50.699
I can't die.
I haven't figured anything out yet.

03:55.872 --> 03:58.073
I'm going to look after you
as best I can.

04:06.082 --> 04:08.714
Are you this kind
to all your patients?

04:08.749 --> 04:11.717
No. I'm not.

04:21.024 --> 04:24.060
Hey kids, showbiz!
Come on, let me hear you.

04:26.231 --> 04:28.865
Now, kids, no more pussyfooting
around here at the slippera.

04:28.900 --> 04:31.601
Speaking of, uh...

04:31.635 --> 04:35.136
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, please put
your hands together right now</i>

04:35.170 --> 04:39.674
for the one, the only
miss Julie atlas muse.

04:53.922 --> 04:56.122
Wow.

05:02.228 --> 05:04.629
This is incredible.
She's like a...

05:04.663 --> 05:07.297
Siren in a poached egg.

05:11.669 --> 05:14.270
Jonathan, I want to talk
to you about something.

05:15.805 --> 05:18.507
I don't think our polyamory
experiment is working.

05:18.541 --> 05:22.276
Really?
Oh, this is wonderful ns.

05:22.311 --> 05:25.545
I mean, I like Warren...
he's a great guy,

05:25.579 --> 05:29.381
a little obnoxious, but I do
prefer to have you all to myself.

05:29.415 --> 05:32.851
Oh n... oh, sweetie,
I didn't say that right.

05:34.887 --> 05:36.487
I adore you,

05:36.521 --> 05:39.989
but I want to be
exclusive with Warren.

05:42.525 --> 05:45.626
You're choosing Warren over me?

05:45.661 --> 05:48.195
I just feel that I have more
of a history with Warren

05:48.230 --> 05:50.631
and he's my first love.

05:50.665 --> 05:53.734
<i>Well, we have a shared history.
I mean, three months,</i>

05:53.768 --> 05:56.603
it's not epic,
but it's not unhistorical.

05:56.637 --> 05:58.672
Jonathan,
Warren took my virginity.

05:58.706 --> 06:01.374
<i>I was with him
for four years in college.</i>

06:01.408 --> 06:04.043
I think I'm supposed
to marry him.

06:05.579 --> 06:08.181
Oh, I can't believe this.

06:08.215 --> 06:11.484
- I'm sorry. - Why didn't you just
break up with me on the phone?

06:11.518 --> 06:14.086
Why make a date?
Why bring me here

06:14.120 --> 06:17.455
with a naked girl in a
balloon blowing me kisses?

06:17.489 --> 06:20.624
<i>- I mean, it's... - Well, I thought
that this could be a way</i>

06:20.658 --> 06:22.225
to celebrate the...

06:22.260 --> 06:25.962
sweetness and sexiness
of our relationship?

06:27.764 --> 06:30.399
I'm sorry
if it was a dumb idea.

06:31.935 --> 06:34.102
I still really want
to be friends.

06:35.304 --> 06:36.537
Yeah.

06:40.541 --> 06:44.109
<i>Miss Julie atlas muse.</i>

06:56.753 --> 06:58.620
- Jonathan ames?
- Yeah, who are you?

06:58.654 --> 07:00.388
Hey! What the...
what is this?

07:00.422 --> 07:03.057
- Huh? - Calm down or
I'll ventilate you.

07:03.091 --> 07:05.793
Ventilate? Listen, there must
be some kind of mistake.

07:05.827 --> 07:09.963
I have never been mugged before.
This neighborhood has been gentrified for years!

07:09.997 --> 07:12.232
No! Help! Help!

07:13.400 --> 07:16.069
No!
This is a mistake.

07:24.412 --> 07:26.913
Don't drop me!
Don't drop me!

07:26.948 --> 07:29.182
- Where's the ha drive?
- What hard drive?

07:29.216 --> 07:31.551
The one you copied and stole from us.
Where is it?

07:31.585 --> 07:34.253
You ve the wrong person.
I don't know what you're talking about!

07:34.288 --> 07:36.521
- We're gonna drop you, jerkoff.
- No, Ahh!

07:36.556 --> 07:38.456
My phone!

07:38.491 --> 07:41.525
Ahh, oh my God!
Is that the gowanus?

07:41.560 --> 07:43.060
The gowanus has gonorrhea!

07:43.094 --> 07:45.195
Don't drop me!
Don't drop me!

07:45.229 --> 07:47.497
- Does it really have gonorrhea?
- Oh yeah.

07:47.531 --> 07:48.932
I read about it
in "the post."

07:48.966 --> 07:50.466
All right,
let's yank the kid up.

07:50.500 --> 07:52.434
The tendonitis in my elbow
feels like shit.

07:52.469 --> 07:55.336
All right, we're pulling you up, you candyass.
You'd better talk!

07:59.206 --> 08:01.574
We know you have
the hard drive, asshole!

08:01.608 --> 08:04.643
You were the last one to have a session
before the cops raided the place.

08:04.678 --> 08:07.313
Sylvia says she found you
monkeying around in the office.

08:07.347 --> 08:09.115
Oh, the dungeon!

08:09.149 --> 08:11.350
I thought her name
was mistress Florence.

08:14.187 --> 08:16.988
- Remember because I read that nasme as
Florence. - Now spill! - I don't have the thing.

08:17.023 --> 08:19.990
I destroyed it for a client.

08:20.025 --> 08:23.158
- I'm a private Detective.
- And I'm a male model.

08:23.193 --> 08:24.959
Jesus f Christ.

08:27.896 --> 08:30.063
- So who hired you?
- I can't tell you.

08:30.098 --> 08:32.999
- I won't tell you.
- Let me make this simple for you.

08:33.033 --> 08:34.866
We're on the lam.
We need money.

08:34.900 --> 08:37.469
That hard drive
was our I.R.A.

08:37.503 --> 08:40.337
- Our retirement fund.
- Yeah, jerkoff!

08:40.371 --> 08:42.972
We had pictures. We had videos.
We could have made a fortune.

08:46.610 --> 08:48.378
- It was a blackmail gold mine.
- Now all we have is you and whoso you have a choice:

08:48.412 --> 08:50.447
Give us your client's name
or we hurt you.

08:50.481 --> 08:52.715
That a terrible choice.

08:52.750 --> 08:55.451
Ow!
A Charley horse?

08:55.485 --> 08:57.185
That is so cheap!

08:57.220 --> 08:59.688
- One more!
- Name.

09:00.623 --> 09:02.323
Okay!

09:03.692 --> 09:05.825
His name's not gonna
do you any good.

09:05.860 --> 09:08.694
He's a cop.
He knew there was gonna a raid.

09:08.728 --> 09:10.963
You guys were
laundering drug money.

09:10.997 --> 09:12.764
You're not gonna
blackmail a cop.

09:12.798 --> 09:14.666
He's right.

09:14.700 --> 09:17.234
Fuck.
Fuck fuck!

09:17.269 --> 09:19.136
Should we kill him?

09:19.170 --> 09:20.837
What?! Kill... no!
No killing.

09:20.872 --> 09:23.506
No killing. I'll pay you.
How much do you want?

09:23.540 --> 09:26.742
Now you're talking.
We want to open up a new dungeon in Boston.

09:26.776 --> 09:29.778
- That's about 20 grand.
- We only use the best equipment.

09:29.812 --> 09:32.646
$20,000?
That's impossible.

09:32.681 --> 09:36.483
You see, I'm also a writer.
My second novel was just rejected.

09:36.517 --> 09:38.151
I have to pay back my advance.

09:38.185 --> 09:40.019
I teach at night
to make ends meet.

09:40.053 --> 09:43.389
I can't take this shit!
Let's just kill him and get out of here.

09:43.423 --> 09:46.091
No, shut up.
Do you have any rich friends?

09:46.125 --> 09:47.359
Yes, I have one,

09:50.662 --> 09:53.264
but I don't think we should
involve my friends.

09:53.298 --> 09:56.400
Ow ow ow ow!

09:56.434 --> 09:57.534
Four!

09:58.736 --> 10:00.137
I really like hitting you.

10:00.171 --> 10:02.939
- You gonna call your rich friend?
- No.

10:02.973 --> 10:04.740
Okay!
Okay.

10:04.775 --> 10:07.475
But I just want you guys
to acknowledge

10:07.509 --> 10:10.277
that I probably could have
taken a few more punches,

10:10.312 --> 10:13.447
but because we're in a rush
I'll make the call now.

10:30.896 --> 10:33.297
- Hello?
- George, thank God.

10:33.331 --> 10:34.998
<i>- It's Jonathan.
- Jonathan.</i>

10:35.032 --> 10:36.967
- Dear boy, how are you?
- I'm in trouble.

10:37.001 --> 10:38.935
- I've been abducted.
- What? Why?

10:38.969 --> 10:41.838
It's really complicated.
It has to do with one of my cases.

10:41.872 --> 10:44.607
Anyway, my captors are
demanding $20,000 tonight

10:44.641 --> 10:46.275
- or...
- Or we're gonna kill you.

10:46.310 --> 10:48.043
Stop saying that.

10:48.078 --> 10:51.113
Anyways, George,
it's actually quite serious.

10:51.147 --> 10:53.648
Can you come up with
that kind of money tonight?

10:53.682 --> 10:55.650
Jonathan, is this a joke?

10:55.684 --> 10:58.452
I've already vaporized
two bags of pot.

10:58.486 --> 11:00.220
This is not a joke, I swear.

11:00.255 --> 11:02.989
I need you to bring
$20,000 to...

11:03.024 --> 11:05.725
Zolfo concrete factory
on Ninth off Smith street.

11:05.759 --> 11:07.893
Did you get that, George?
Write it down, okay?

11:07.927 --> 11:11.595
<i>Ninth street in Brooklyn off
Smith by the Gowan Canal.</i>

11:11.630 --> 11:13.330
Uh, got it.
All right.

11:13.364 --> 11:16.899
I'll mail it first thing in the morning.
Now who do I me the check to?

11:16.933 --> 11:19.902
No, George,
not tomorrow, tonight.

11:19.936 --> 11:22.604
I need you to bring
the money in cash tonight!

11:22.638 --> 11:24.639
Do you understand?
My wife is on the line.

11:24.673 --> 11:26.807
My life's on the line too!

11:26.841 --> 11:31.110
Oh, Jonathan, I meant
to tell you in person.

11:31.144 --> 11:34.446
I have prostate cancer.

11:34.481 --> 11:35.748
Stage ii.

11:35.782 --> 11:38.950
<i>Can you believe that?
Stage ii!</i>

11:38.985 --> 11:40.952
Oh my God, really?

11:42.355 --> 11:44.823
Is that why you had
the pain in your penis?

11:44.857 --> 11:46.457
No no.

11:46.492 --> 11:49.493
The doctor said the pain
in the penis was unrelated.

11:49.527 --> 11:50.761
Oh my God, I

11:50.795 --> 11:52.896
I don't wanna hear
about cancer or penises.

11:52.930 --> 11:55.865
I want you to bring
$20,000 by 2:00 A.M.

11:55.900 --> 11:58.601
Or your weird little friend
here is going to die.

11:58.636 --> 12:00.103
I might die.

12:00.137 --> 12:03.405
Did Jonathan tell you that I
have stage ii prostate cancer?

12:05.274 --> 12:08.176
Is there someone else
you can call?

12:08.210 --> 12:11.012
Play ball or we're gonna hurt
this kid in a permanent way.

12:11.046 --> 12:13.448
<i>- You hear what I'm saying?
- Wait wait, yes.</i>

12:13.482 --> 12:15.382
Sorry, um, uh,

12:15.417 --> 12:17.284
20,000 cash,

12:17.319 --> 12:21.121
concrete factory
on ninth in Brooklyn.

12:21.156 --> 12:23.758
2:00 A.M.
Did I do that right?

12:23.792 --> 12:26.159
Come alone. No cops.
Don't be late.

12:28.062 --> 12:29.362
Whoa.

12:29.397 --> 12:31.365
Cancer?
I can't believe it.

12:31.399 --> 12:33.400
George is like
a second father to me.

12:33.435 --> 12:35.836
I wouldn't worry about him.
Cancer takes time.

12:35.870 --> 12:38.638
Bullets move fast.

12:40.307 --> 12:43.175
Most prostate cancer is treatable
if it's caught in time.

12:43.209 --> 12:45.076
My dad had it.
He's fine.

12:45.111 --> 12:47.411
I'm pretty sure your
friend will be all right.

12:47.446 --> 12:48.779
Thank you.

12:48.814 --> 12:50.681
You're welcome.

13:01.324 --> 13:03.258
George, George.

13:03.293 --> 13:06.528
I think we should just pay or go to the cops.
This is insanity.

13:06.563 --> 13:09.731
No no, look what happened
to the lindbergh baby.

13:11.500 --> 13:14.702
- Jonathan is not the lindbergh baby.
- Well, to me he is.

13:14.736 --> 13:16.970
You know, I'm very
very fond of that boy.

13:18.106 --> 13:19.506
What is that?

13:19.540 --> 13:22.976
It's a hand-held marijuana vaporizer.

13:23.010 --> 13:26.413
If we're gonna do something this stupid,
I don't think we should be stoned.

13:26.447 --> 13:28.248
Oh, I'm already very stoned.

13:28.283 --> 13:30.517
All right, fuck it.
What's the plan of attack?

13:30.552 --> 13:33.987
Okay, all right. First we go to
Howard's and we get outfitted.

13:34.021 --> 13:36.489
You know, I was in the,
uh uh, national guard

13:36.523 --> 13:38.758
in Connecticut during
the Vietnam war.

13:38.792 --> 13:41.393
File that under
"who gives a shit?"

13:41.427 --> 13:43.795
Well, I'm just saying.

13:43.829 --> 13:46.163
<i>- Hold this for a second.
Let me just... -</i>

13:46.198 --> 13:48.833
- George, George!
- All right, all right.

13:55.205 --> 13:58.206
Um, hey, could I get a sip?

14:10.348 --> 14:12.115
Whoo, thanks.

14:12.150 --> 14:14.083
I've had a really bad night.

14:14.117 --> 14:17.585
On top of everything else...
you guys,

14:17.620 --> 14:19.086
George has cancer...

14:19.121 --> 14:20.921
my girlfriend broke up with me.

14:20.956 --> 14:23.457
Wow, that sucks.
Why?

14:23.491 --> 14:25.692
She's going back
to her college boyfriend...

14:25.726 --> 14:27.927
this real fat jerk.

14:27.961 --> 14:30.963
She says she still wants to be
friends, but I'm pretty hurt.

14:30.997 --> 14:34.232
That's the worst.
"Let's be friends."

14:34.267 --> 14:36.167
I hope you told her
to go fuck herself.

14:36.201 --> 14:38.903
I would never talk to her like that.
I mean...

14:40.338 --> 14:43.873
what kind of a dickhead are you?
Don't be such a pussy!

14:52.348 --> 14:55.417
This is the lightest most-effective
body armor money can buy.

14:55.451 --> 14:57.719
- You need this, no discussion.
- Sold.

14:57.753 --> 15:00.922
Howard, again thanks for opening
up for us at such a late hour.

15:00.956 --> 15:03.924
Come on, George.
In my line of work I'm always on standby.

15:03.959 --> 15:07.961
- Right. - Now, rum-converted
g4 rubber-bullet guns.

15:07.995 --> 15:09.929
Nonlethal.
Made in Germany.

15:09.963 --> 15:13.432
Very effective. I chose these so
in case something goes wrong,

15:13.466 --> 15:15.467
you can avoid
a manslaughter charge.

15:15.501 --> 15:17.769
Whoa whoa whoa whoa, what do
you mean manslaughter? George?

15:17.803 --> 15:19.637
All right, we'll take them.

15:19.671 --> 15:22.006
Stand down, George.
And makes sure

15:22.040 --> 15:24.274
the safety's off
before you go in the theater.

15:24.308 --> 15:26.309
- Right there.
There you go. - Okay.

15:26.343 --> 15:28.845
Check.
Oh Howard!

15:28.879 --> 15:30.847
You sell vaporers?

15:30.881 --> 15:34.150
Uh, no no! This is not "star trek"
and these are not vaporizers.

15:34.184 --> 15:36.385
This is a walkie-talkie.
You're gonna use this

15:36.419 --> 15:38.520
to communicate with Ray
when you guys are in the field.

15:38.554 --> 15:41.956
- Right, check.
- Marine-issue flashbang grenades.

15:41.991 --> 15:44.925
Very very loud.
And cover your eyes when you throw these.

15:44.960 --> 15:47.660
They create a blinding
magnesium flash.

15:47.695 --> 15:49.729
Confuses the hell
out of the tangos.

15:49.763 --> 15:51.998
Splendid.
Howard, you really know your stuff.

15:52.032 --> 15:54.233
- Doesn't he?
- Our boys are using these

15:54.267 --> 15:56.134
in night operations
now in Iran.

15:56.168 --> 15:59.837
- Don't you mean Iraq? - Little less
Sundance channel there, park slope.

15:59.871 --> 16:01.338
What are these guys for?

16:01.372 --> 16:03.707
I had those action figures
since I was a boy.

16:03.741 --> 16:06.542
I look at them at night
before I go to sleep.

16:06.577 --> 16:09.745
So uh, Howard, your wife
thrown you out, has she?

16:09.779 --> 16:12.513
No, I like camping out here.
You know, you spend a few nights here,

16:12.548 --> 16:15.850
go home on furlough,
really bumps the conjugal visits

16:15.884 --> 16:18.518
up a couple of notches
on the old gun belt, you know.

16:24.258 --> 16:26.025
Well, we should go.

16:31.698 --> 16:33.231
So do you have a girlfriend?

16:33.266 --> 16:36.000
Nah.
I don't have much luck.

16:36.035 --> 16:38.036
You don't have any luck
'cause you're a tranny chaser.

16:38.070 --> 16:40.705
You know I don't like
when you say that!

16:40.739 --> 16:43.107
You're so judgmental.

16:47.012 --> 16:49.513
- What about you?
- I've been married 17 years.

16:49.547 --> 16:51.914
- She's already up in Boston
waiting for me. - Wow.

16:51.949 --> 16:54.616
I've never been with anyone longer than two years.
What's your secret?

16:54.650 --> 16:56.651
Never go to bed angry.

16:56.685 --> 16:58.686
I pass this on to you.

16:58.720 --> 17:01.022
Come on, that's your secret?
Never go to bed angry?

17:01.057 --> 17:03.358
That's like the oldest one
in the book.

17:03.392 --> 17:05.893
I mean, that is a real cliche.
It's what my parents told me.

17:07.695 --> 17:10.030
It's a cliche 'cause it works.

17:10.064 --> 17:11.698
Now shut the fuck up!

17:31.148 --> 17:33.416
That must be it.

17:33.450 --> 17:36.051
All right.
We'll attack in 30 minutes

17:36.085 --> 17:37.985
at 0200 hours.

17:38.020 --> 17:40.553
You know, 2:00 A.M.

17:40.587 --> 17:42.188
George, I'm gonna
speak frankly.

17:42.222 --> 17:44.657
I'm out of shape and you're old.
We shouldn't be doing this.

17:44.691 --> 17:46.324
Oh come on, we'll be fine.
Really.

17:46.359 --> 17:49.260
I always did beautifully
during maneuvers at the nat...

17:49.294 --> 17:50.962
national guard
in Connecticut, yeah.

17:50.996 --> 17:53.398
Hey look, I understand
your concern

17:53.432 --> 17:56.400
and maybe I'm a little
devil-may-care right now...

17:57.935 --> 17:59.804
Because I'm...

18:01.740 --> 18:03.908
look, there's something
I wanna tell you.

18:03.942 --> 18:05.243
Oh shit, now what?

18:05.277 --> 18:08.847
I found out today that I
have prostate cancer.

18:08.881 --> 18:11.416
- What?
- Stage ii.

18:12.685 --> 18:14.419
George, I'm sorry.
That's terrible.

18:14.454 --> 18:15.988
Yeah.

18:16.022 --> 18:19.324
But something strange happened.

18:19.358 --> 18:22.894
My new doctor is a woman
and after she told me,

18:22.928 --> 18:25.863
she held me to her breasts.

18:25.897 --> 18:28.098
Nice breasts?

18:28.132 --> 18:30.266
Yeah, very nice.

18:30.301 --> 18:32.201
And then...
then we made out.

18:32.235 --> 18:33.769
I mean she's
a hell of a kisser.

18:33.804 --> 18:37.472
I might be dying and falling
in love at the same time.

18:37.507 --> 18:41.075
Uh, I hope it's okay
that I brought that up.

18:41.110 --> 18:43.911
Your cancer? Of course.
I'm your friend.

18:43.946 --> 18:46.347
No no no.
The falling in love part.

18:46.381 --> 18:49.383
Jonathan told me that
leah broke up with you.

18:51.585 --> 18:54.120
Yeah, it's been rough.

18:54.154 --> 18:56.755
People think that
I don't feel things.

18:58.590 --> 19:00.757
The truth is
is that I feel everything.

19:04.862 --> 19:07.830
And you see I read this quote
on the Internet by Oscar wilde.

19:07.865 --> 19:09.765
Oh, I love Oscar wilde.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.934
"De profundis" is amazing.

19:11.968 --> 19:14.036
Don't bring up that
Oscar wilde crap again.

19:14.070 --> 19:16.771
- I can't take it.
- So when Oscar wilde was in prison...

19:16.806 --> 19:20.207
now I've done some time, which is
probably why I relate so well to him...

19:20.242 --> 19:23.711
he said he had a love
that dare not speak its name.

19:23.745 --> 19:25.946
My problem

19:25.980 --> 19:28.314
is that my love

19:28.348 --> 19:31.016
doesn't even have a name.

19:31.050 --> 19:33.884
Oh yeah, it does.
It's called tranny chaser.

19:36.388 --> 19:39.990
- Do not talk to me that way!
- Get him!

19:49.032 --> 19:50.866
Cut it out!

19:53.202 --> 19:56.070
Oscar wild morons!

19:56.104 --> 19:57.538
<i>Get up.</i>

19:59.907 --> 20:03.376
George, why exactly
are we attacking at 2:00 A.M.?

20:03.410 --> 20:05.945
Because that's when I'm
supposed to deliver the money.

20:05.979 --> 20:08.046
But how is that
a surprise attack?

20:08.081 --> 20:10.816
Oh God!

20:10.850 --> 20:13.985
Ugh, you're right!
I am a stoned idiot!

20:14.019 --> 20:17.721
I got mono-fixated
on 2:00 A.M.

20:17.756 --> 20:20.156
Aw shit!
We gotta go.

20:20.191 --> 20:21.924
We'll be seven minutes early.

20:21.959 --> 20:25.361
- That is hardly a surprise.
- Well, it'll have to do.

20:34.003 --> 20:35.804
Why you running like that?

20:35.838 --> 20:38.607
It's what we used
to do in Connecticut.

20:45.812 --> 20:48.013
Hey, where's your helmet?

20:48.047 --> 20:50.616
Shit!
I left it in the car.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.951
Fuck it.
What's the game plan?

20:52.985 --> 20:56.120
Go look through that window.
I'll provide cover.

20:56.154 --> 20:58.789
Why do you get
to provide cover?

20:58.823 --> 21:00.990
Because I have cancer.

21:01.024 --> 21:03.225
I cannot believe
you're using that already.

21:03.260 --> 21:05.827
I'm also older.
Just go.

21:05.862 --> 21:08.230
Come on, go!

21:21.508 --> 21:23.943
We owned a dungeon for five
years and you can't tie a knot?

21:23.977 --> 21:25.777
You know I'm not
mechanically inclined.

21:25.811 --> 21:28.711
I can't believe you pulled that.
We were having a nice conversation.

21:28.745 --> 21:31.013
- I'm sorry. - You probably don't
even like Oscar wilde, do you?

21:31.047 --> 21:32.648
<i>I love Oscar wilde.</i>

21:37.888 --> 21:40.122
There's two of them.
What should I do?

21:44.527 --> 21:46.595
What'd you say?

21:48.831 --> 21:51.499
I can't hear you.

21:58.272 --> 21:59.739
What?!

21:59.773 --> 22:01.440
Come on!

22:06.412 --> 22:08.379
Oh shit, check the safety.

22:13.417 --> 22:16.417
Oh... oh dear God!

22:16.451 --> 22:18.818
Ray?

22:18.853 --> 22:20.520
You shot me in the head!

22:20.554 --> 22:22.288
I'm so sorry.
It's Howard's fault.

22:22.322 --> 22:24.056
He told me to check the safety.

22:24.090 --> 22:25.357
Oh jeez.

22:25.391 --> 22:27.726
What the fuck is going on?

22:27.760 --> 22:29.994
Throw your flashbang.
Go throw your flashbang.

22:45.175 --> 22:47.176
Why didn't you bring
the money, asshole?

22:47.211 --> 22:49.979
I don't negotiate with
kidnappers or terrorists.

22:50.013 --> 22:51.913
Hey, we're not
al-Qaeda, jerkoff!

22:51.948 --> 22:55.149
We're Americans.
We own a dungeon and we deal drugs.

22:55.184 --> 22:57.752
Really?
What kind of drugs?

22:57.786 --> 23:00.254
Mostly cocaine.
A little ecstasy.

23:00.288 --> 23:01.922
I'd like to try ecstasy.

23:01.956 --> 23:04.524
- Oh, shut up, dukakis!
- Let's kill one of them.

23:04.558 --> 23:06.593
Let's kill this one
from "lord of the rings."

23:06.627 --> 23:09.529
- Oh God, no, I've already been shot!
- Yeah, but it didn't kill you.

23:09.563 --> 23:12.097
I am surprised it didn't
even break the skin.

23:12.131 --> 23:15.433
- George, shut up, please!
- If you're gonna shoot someone, shoot me.

23:15.467 --> 23:17.201
- This is all my fault.
- Okay.

23:17.236 --> 23:19.003
Wait wait wait wait!

23:19.037 --> 23:21.371
Maybe you could just hit me again.
You wanna do that?

23:21.406 --> 23:22.839
You-you liked it before?

23:22.873 --> 23:24.941
No no, nobody's going
to shoot anybody.

23:24.975 --> 23:28.043
I'll get you the money, just give me till...
The afternoon.

23:28.077 --> 23:30.578
Oh no, I don't trust you, old man.
You already screwed me once.

23:30.613 --> 23:32.646
But we are going
to shoot somebody...

23:32.681 --> 23:35.282
unless I get my money!

23:35.317 --> 23:38.084
Are you crying?
Stop!

23:38.119 --> 23:40.553
<i>Get him a tissue.</i>

23:57.136 --> 23:59.971
Jonathan, why did your friend
park on the lawn?

24:00.005 --> 24:01.972
- Mom, he's not my friend.
- Is that the money?

24:02.006 --> 24:03.940
- Yeah, - Dad, I'm
really sorry about this.

24:03.975 --> 24:06.810
- I'll pay you back, I promise.
- Shut up! Toss it over.

24:10.046 --> 24:12.080
George, why are you
wearing a helmet?

24:12.115 --> 24:14.749
Ray, what happened
to your forehead?

24:14.784 --> 24:16.718
George shot me
with a rubber bullet.

24:16.752 --> 24:19.954
It was an accident, I swear.
He wasn't wearing his helmet.

24:19.988 --> 24:22.322
What the fuck?
There's hardly anything in here.

24:22.357 --> 24:25.024
- What are you talking about?
- There's $2,000.

24:25.059 --> 24:27.326
That's plenty.
It's all I had in the house safe.

24:27.361 --> 24:29.895
What are you gonna do?
It's broad daylight.

24:29.929 --> 24:32.496
- What's happening?
- Florence, be quiet.

24:32.531 --> 24:34.564
Fuck!
Let's get out of here.

24:34.599 --> 24:36.499
It's new Jersey.
It's too bright.

24:36.533 --> 24:38.434
We can't kill people here.

24:43.873 --> 24:46.408
Is everybody you know
a backstabbing double-crosser?

24:46.442 --> 24:49.610
And I shared my booze with you.
What kind of a person are you?

24:49.645 --> 24:51.879
- Sorry.
- Stop apologizing all the time.

24:51.913 --> 24:54.214
Sorry.

24:58.886 --> 25:01.121
I notice you're
driving a zipcar.

25:01.155 --> 25:03.990
- Is it more convenient
than Avis or Hertz? - Dad!

25:04.025 --> 25:07.527
I just gave them $2,000.
I'm entitled to some information.

25:07.561 --> 25:10.095
Let's go.

25:14.899 --> 25:18.134
New Jersey sucks!

25:19.202 --> 25:21.871
Well, that's just rude.

25:21.905 --> 25:23.205
This is me

25:23.240 --> 25:26.975
and this is my collection of
the original 26 tarzan novels.

25:27.010 --> 25:29.211
I didn't know you had
"The Avengers" Korvac saga.

25:29.245 --> 25:32.246
- Yeah, you can borrow
them if you like. - Nah.

25:32.281 --> 25:35.649
Hey, I just really wanna thank you
guys for coming to my rescue.

25:35.684 --> 25:38.785
And, George, if there's
anything you need,

25:38.820 --> 25:40.220
we're here for you.

25:40.254 --> 25:42.021
I know.
Thank you.

25:42.055 --> 25:44.590
And, George, I don't like to
talk on the phone that much,

25:44.624 --> 25:46.791
- but, uh, you can call me anytime.
- Okay.

25:46.826 --> 25:49.327
- I won't pick up, but you can
leave me a message. - Okay.

25:49.361 --> 25:51.328
<i>The eggs are ready!</i>

25:51.363 --> 25:53.130
<i>I also have whitefish!</i>

25:53.164 --> 25:55.999
No herring?
No pork chops?

25:56.033 --> 25:58.401
<i>I have herring
just for you, Ray!</i>

25:58.435 --> 26:01.637
<i>- And lox.
- We'll be right down, mom.</i>

26:01.671 --> 26:04.072
This is wonderful.
I'm starving.

26:04.106 --> 26:06.775
<i>Ira, wait for the boys!</i>

26:06.809 --> 26:08.310
<i>What? I'm hungry.</i>

26:08.344 --> 26:11.146
You know, I like new Jersey.

26:11.180 --> 26:13.715
Is it true they've
legalized marijuana?

26:13.750 --> 26:15.485
- Yeah.
- Oh.

26:15.519 --> 26:18.020
George, you are the greatest
pothead I've ever known.

26:18.055 --> 26:20.089
Thanks, buddy.
