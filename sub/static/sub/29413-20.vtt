WEBVTT

00:09.705 --> 00:12.229
Okay, we're almost there.

00:16.016 --> 00:17.713
Calvin,
how you doing on your side?

00:17.756 --> 00:19.149
I'm good.

00:19.193 --> 00:21.021
Oh.

00:23.936 --> 00:25.764
Whoa! What's that?

00:25.808 --> 00:27.070
I have no idea.

00:27.114 --> 00:28.811
It just got delivered
from my Grandpa Ed.

00:28.854 --> 00:30.552
Well, it's not complainingabout my cooking,

00:30.595 --> 00:32.641
so it can't beGrandma Jean.

00:32.684 --> 00:36.253
All right, well, Calvin,help me open this thing up.All right.

00:39.430 --> 00:41.519
Oh, my God!

00:41.563 --> 00:44.696
Hey, cool! It's Rudolph!

00:45.697 --> 00:47.090
So, just to be clear,

00:47.134 --> 00:48.744
this is not your grandmother?

00:51.355 --> 00:53.314
I can't believe it.

00:53.357 --> 00:55.707
He gave me his
moose head.

00:55.751 --> 00:57.535
Why would your grandfather
send you that?

00:57.579 --> 01:00.843
It looked so good in Michigan
where I couldn't see it.

01:00.886 --> 01:03.454
He must've remembered how much
I love this thing. You know,

01:03.498 --> 01:04.716
I was actually with him

01:04.760 --> 01:07.937
when he brought this
magnificent beast down.

01:07.980 --> 01:09.591
I didn't knowyou used to hunt.

01:09.634 --> 01:11.636
Oh, I didn't. We were
driving to mini golf,

01:11.680 --> 01:14.117
and he hit it
on Route 43.

01:15.205 --> 01:17.642
I know how you feel, buddy.

01:17.686 --> 01:20.906
I never saw Dave coming, either.

01:20.950 --> 01:22.865
â™ª Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood â™ª

01:22.908 --> 01:24.084
â™ª Welcome to the hood.

01:30.829 --> 01:32.092
What's up, Dave?

01:32.135 --> 01:35.356
You taking your moose
for a walk?

01:35.399 --> 01:37.227
Yeah, you know,
I was gonna put it up,

01:37.271 --> 01:38.533
but Gemma and I talked it over

01:38.576 --> 01:40.012
and agreed it should go
in the garage.

01:40.056 --> 01:41.840
Oh. Well, I guess we know

01:41.884 --> 01:44.016
who wears the antlers
in your house.

01:44.060 --> 01:45.844
What's that supposed to mean?

01:45.888 --> 01:52.242
It means you got run over
worse than that moose did.

01:52.286 --> 01:54.157
You know, Gemma and I
are equal partners.

01:54.201 --> 01:55.985
We make all of our
decisions together.

01:56.028 --> 01:58.901
Let me tell yousomething about marriage, Dave.

01:58.944 --> 02:02.034
Someone always makesthe decisions.

02:02.078 --> 02:05.864
And if you don't knowwho that is, it ain't you.

02:05.908 --> 02:08.171
Come on. That is
just another one

02:08.215 --> 02:11.087
of your old-fashioned
relationship theories,

02:11.131 --> 02:15.135
like how the husband
can't be the little spoon.

02:16.223 --> 02:17.485
Trust me, Dave.

02:17.528 --> 02:18.877
Gemma's manipulating you.

02:18.921 --> 02:20.662
You watch.

02:20.705 --> 02:23.099
The next time you makea decision, you'll see.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.710
She's callingall the shots.

02:25.754 --> 02:27.277
That's where you're wrong.

02:27.321 --> 02:30.715
Being the little
spoon was myidea.

02:32.369 --> 02:35.198
All I'm saying, if this
were my moose head,

02:35.242 --> 02:37.940
it would be up on
my wall right now

02:37.983 --> 02:40.160
no matter who didn't like it.

02:40.203 --> 02:41.683
Well, in that case,
do you want it?

02:41.726 --> 02:43.075
No, thank you.

02:43.119 --> 02:45.730
If I wanted some big, goofy face
in my living room,

02:45.774 --> 02:47.515
I'll invite you over.

02:52.215 --> 02:54.739
Oh, hey, babe.Hey.

02:54.783 --> 02:56.915
Junk.

02:56.959 --> 02:58.743
Junk.

02:58.787 --> 03:00.919
"Save the children."

03:00.963 --> 03:03.270
Junk.

03:03.313 --> 03:04.923
Oh.

03:04.967 --> 03:06.142
Oh.What?

03:06.186 --> 03:08.275
Tina, our accountant
finished our taxes.

03:08.318 --> 03:11.060
Ooh, ooh, ooh,
are we getting a refund?

03:11.103 --> 03:12.235
Hold-hold on now,

03:12.279 --> 03:13.671
'cause this could
go either way.

03:13.715 --> 03:16.239
You're right. You're right.Come on, come on.

03:16.283 --> 03:19.199
Lord...

03:19.242 --> 03:24.029
everything we haveis because of you.

03:24.073 --> 03:27.511
So please don't make us shareany of it with the government.

03:29.296 --> 03:31.994
Amen.

03:32.037 --> 03:34.301
A-A-And, Lord,

03:34.344 --> 03:35.476
you know I was just playing

03:35.519 --> 03:39.262
about not saving
the kids, right?

03:39.306 --> 03:40.829
Amen.Amen.

03:40.872 --> 03:42.047
Okay.
All right.

03:42.091 --> 03:43.266
Ooh, baby, open it.

03:43.310 --> 03:45.268
Okay.Oh...

03:45.312 --> 03:47.662
Oh...

03:47.705 --> 03:48.663
we gettin' a refund!

03:48.706 --> 03:50.882
Ha ha!

03:50.926 --> 03:51.970
Check it out, babe.

03:52.014 --> 03:54.234
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.Look at that.

03:54.277 --> 03:55.887
And it's even gota comma in it.

03:55.931 --> 03:58.542
You know what that means, right?

03:58.586 --> 04:00.370
You bet I do.

04:00.414 --> 04:03.808
BOTH:
Money dance! Money dance!
Money dance!

04:03.852 --> 04:05.680
Money dance!Money dance!

04:05.723 --> 04:08.509
Ah, oh! Get it, baby, get it.Get it, get it, get it, get it.

04:08.552 --> 04:10.467
Get it, baby, get it.Get it, get it, get it, get it.

04:10.511 --> 04:12.252
Get it. Hey!

04:16.952 --> 04:18.693
You know, stuff like this
is the reason

04:18.736 --> 04:21.304
I never have my friends
come over.

04:21.348 --> 04:22.871
Don't hate, Malcolm.

04:22.914 --> 04:26.135
Your mom and I just found out
we getting a fat tax refund.

04:26.178 --> 04:27.267
Yeah, that's great, Pop.

04:27.310 --> 04:28.659
Maybe you can use
some of that money

04:28.703 --> 04:30.444
for the therapy I'm gonna need
after seeing this.

04:30.487 --> 04:33.577
Calvin, this is way morethan last year.

04:33.621 --> 04:35.057
What are we gonnaspend it on?

04:35.100 --> 04:36.885
It is a lot, babe.

04:36.928 --> 04:39.366
You know, maybe we can getthat thing that we talked about.

04:39.409 --> 04:41.324
Mm, you're right.
Mm-hmm.

04:41.368 --> 04:42.412
Mm-hmm-hmm-hmm.

04:42.456 --> 04:43.761
Oh, what y'all gonna get?

04:43.805 --> 04:45.720
A massage chair.A trip to Italy.

04:48.766 --> 04:51.682
Calvin, I've wanted to go toItaly for years; you know that.

04:51.726 --> 04:54.424
Babe, a trip to Italy
will be over in a week.

04:54.468 --> 04:57.906
I can eat spaghetti in my
massage chair forever.

04:58.994 --> 05:01.083
I'm not gettinga massage chair.

05:01.126 --> 05:03.128
And I'm not going to Italy.

05:04.782 --> 05:06.784
I don't know why tax season
gets such a bad rap.

05:06.828 --> 05:08.046
This is fun.

05:11.049 --> 05:12.660
Oh, hey, honey.How was work?

05:12.703 --> 05:14.444
Rough.

05:14.488 --> 05:16.533
I had to fire our Latin teacher.

05:16.577 --> 05:18.056
Really? Why?

05:18.100 --> 05:20.320
Turns out she doesn't
speak Latin.

05:22.234 --> 05:25.586
For the last six monthsshe's just been making up words.

05:27.588 --> 05:30.678
I'm exhausted. What do you say
we order dinner in?

05:30.721 --> 05:31.722
Oh, yeah. What should we get?

05:31.766 --> 05:33.245
I don't care. You pick.

05:33.289 --> 05:35.160
You know, Italian
sounds good to me.

05:35.204 --> 05:37.032
Mm, perfect.

05:37.075 --> 05:38.555
Although, Chinese
sounds good, too.

05:38.599 --> 05:41.341
Okay, then let's do Chinese.

05:41.384 --> 05:43.473
Good choice, sweetie.

05:43.517 --> 05:45.170
Whatever makes you happy.

05:50.480 --> 05:51.960
So, you want to watch
something tonight

05:52.003 --> 05:53.178
after Grover goes to bed?

05:53.222 --> 05:54.702
Oh, yeah, there's thisnew documentary

05:54.745 --> 05:56.181
that I really want to check out.

05:56.225 --> 05:58.706
Great.

05:58.749 --> 06:02.318
Unless you're more in the mood
for a romantic comedy.

06:06.278 --> 06:08.193
Sure.

06:08.237 --> 06:09.804
Yay. Let's do that, then.

06:16.245 --> 06:17.377
Uh...

06:19.379 --> 06:22.599
You know, summer's coming up,
and, uh,

06:22.643 --> 06:25.297
we should really decide
what camp to send Grover to.

06:25.341 --> 06:27.822
Good thinking. Is there one
that you're leaning towards?

06:27.865 --> 06:29.389
I don't know, is...

06:29.432 --> 06:31.347
is there one you're
leaning towards?

06:33.175 --> 06:36.091
Honestly, I haven't had time
to give it much thought.

06:36.134 --> 06:39.616
Well, I was thinking
soccer camp.

06:39.660 --> 06:41.662
Then soccer camp it is.

06:47.581 --> 06:48.756
Really?

06:48.799 --> 06:50.410
Yeah. Totally.

06:50.453 --> 06:52.716
All right.

06:55.197 --> 06:58.374
Although maybe art camp
would be fun.

07:00.637 --> 07:01.856
Terrific.

07:04.511 --> 07:06.034
Good choice, sweetie.

07:06.077 --> 07:08.558
I love it when
you take control.

07:16.479 --> 07:17.872
What's up, Pop?
What's that?

07:17.915 --> 07:20.701
It's a gift basket
for your mother.

07:20.744 --> 07:24.095
It's my way of telling her
we're going to Italy.

07:26.315 --> 07:29.231
All right, check you out, Pop,being a good husband,

07:29.274 --> 07:30.841
taking your wife on her trip.

07:30.885 --> 07:32.582
Oh, I'm a great husband.Yeah.

07:32.626 --> 07:33.931
But we ain't going nowhere.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.719
I'm getting my massage chair.

07:38.762 --> 07:41.025
Wait, say what?

07:41.069 --> 07:42.810
It's simple.

07:42.853 --> 07:45.508
See, when she sees that
I put what she wants

07:45.552 --> 07:47.379
above what I want,

07:47.423 --> 07:50.513
she'll feel way too guilty
to accept the trip,

07:50.557 --> 07:53.037
and tell me to get
my massage chair.

07:54.952 --> 07:59.087
It's like they say:
guilty wife, happy life.

08:01.655 --> 08:04.266
Hey, who's that for?

08:04.309 --> 08:07.225
Aha. This is for you.

08:07.269 --> 08:10.098
It's my way of telling you
that we are going to Italy.

08:10.141 --> 08:11.534
The real one.

08:11.578 --> 08:13.362
Not the little one downtown.

08:13.405 --> 08:16.321
Oh, my God, are...are you serious?

08:16.365 --> 08:17.714
Am I really going to Italy?

08:17.758 --> 08:19.499
Would I lie to you?

08:21.413 --> 08:25.069
You and I are going to roam
around Rome

08:25.113 --> 08:28.116
and get it on in Milan.

08:28.159 --> 08:30.771
Well, baby, what aboutyour massage chair?

08:30.814 --> 08:33.774
Eh, you know, the more
I thought about it,

08:33.817 --> 08:38.561
I just didn't feel right puttingwhat I want over what you want.

08:38.605 --> 08:40.345
No...

08:40.389 --> 08:42.173
I'm just not that guy.

08:43.610 --> 08:45.263
Malcolm, can you believethis man?!

08:45.307 --> 08:46.308
No.

08:48.702 --> 08:50.747
Both of you need to stop. Okay?

08:50.791 --> 08:52.749
Especially you, Malcolm.

08:55.317 --> 08:59.016
Baby, you know what,this is so sweet of you, but...

08:59.060 --> 09:00.801
I can't accept these.

09:00.844 --> 09:03.499
What?

09:03.543 --> 09:05.545
Why ever would you say
such a thing?

09:08.156 --> 09:10.158
Because if we went to Italy,

09:10.201 --> 09:11.942
the whole time,I'd feel guilty

09:11.986 --> 09:14.728
because you gave upwhat you wanted for me.

09:16.643 --> 09:18.819
Do you think you canreturn the tickets?

09:18.862 --> 09:22.910
I don't know, babe,
uh... Oh, yeah.

09:22.953 --> 09:25.565
Look at there. Looks like I didget the refundable ones, so...

09:25.608 --> 09:28.176
Oh. Great. Great.

09:28.219 --> 09:29.525
And, baby, you know what?

09:29.569 --> 09:31.483
I want you to take that money,

09:31.527 --> 09:33.921
and you get yourselfthat massage chair.

09:33.964 --> 09:35.183
Massage chair?Yeah.

09:35.226 --> 09:38.752
What? Oh, that. No.

09:40.231 --> 09:42.320
Yes. Yes! Yes.

09:42.364 --> 09:46.194
That. Because you deserve it.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.990
Well, Pop, I hope
you're proud of yourself.

10:00.034 --> 10:01.339
I am.

10:03.341 --> 10:05.648
Because the gift basket is
refundable, too.

10:09.870 --> 10:11.567
Hey, sweetie, we're--

10:11.611 --> 10:14.396
Holy moly!
That's the moose head.

10:16.572 --> 10:19.270
Oh, hey, guys.
What do you think?

10:20.358 --> 10:21.882
I think it's awesome.

10:21.925 --> 10:25.102
We have something dead
on our wall.

10:25.146 --> 10:27.801
Ha. You got that right, bud.
And more good news.

10:27.844 --> 10:30.107
We're having Italian
for dinner.

10:37.245 --> 10:39.073
And you knowwhat the best part is?

10:39.116 --> 10:40.640
No matter where you are,

10:40.683 --> 10:42.642
it always feelslike he's looking at you.

10:43.860 --> 10:45.819
Sweetie,

10:45.862 --> 10:47.211
could I talk to Dadfor a minute?

10:47.255 --> 10:48.865
Can I have ice cream
while you talk?

10:48.909 --> 10:50.824
Sure.Take your time.

10:52.129 --> 10:54.523
Dave, what the
hell is going on?

10:54.566 --> 10:57.395
I thought we decided that the
moose was going in the garage.

10:57.439 --> 10:59.397
You know,here's the truth.

10:59.441 --> 11:01.530
Last night, I realizedsomething about the way

11:01.573 --> 11:03.619
that you and Imake all of our decisions.

11:03.663 --> 11:04.925
What's that?Well...

11:04.968 --> 11:07.536
that you make all
of our decisions.

11:07.579 --> 11:09.756
What are you talking about?

11:09.799 --> 11:12.367
Look, I-I don't know if you're
conscious of this or not,

11:12.410 --> 11:14.108
but when you want something,

11:14.151 --> 11:15.849
you can be a little...

11:15.892 --> 11:17.938
manipulative.

11:17.981 --> 11:19.722
Oh, come on.

11:19.766 --> 11:21.245
I don't think
you mean that.

11:22.290 --> 11:24.205
You just did it right there!

11:26.120 --> 11:28.296
Okay, if I'm so "manipulative,"

11:28.339 --> 11:30.733
then why do I always ask you
for your opinion?

11:30.777 --> 11:31.952
I honestly don't know.

11:33.867 --> 11:35.433
But think about it.

11:35.477 --> 11:37.697
You know, whether it'swhat's for dinner

11:37.740 --> 11:39.350
or Grover's summer camp,

11:39.394 --> 11:41.091
you ask me what I want

11:41.135 --> 11:44.007
and then you pickwhatever you wanted all along.

11:44.051 --> 11:45.617
Dave, you're
being ridiculous.

11:45.661 --> 11:46.793
Maybe I am.

11:46.836 --> 11:48.751
But you know what?

11:49.796 --> 11:52.712
I like the moose head.

11:52.755 --> 11:56.324
And since you care so much
about myopinion,

11:56.367 --> 11:58.152
I say it stays.

11:59.196 --> 12:01.242
Oh. Look at that.

12:01.285 --> 12:02.591
That's our Italian.

12:04.680 --> 12:06.943
Ooh, yeah.

12:06.987 --> 12:08.249
That's right.

12:08.292 --> 12:10.686
Get on up in there.
Don't be shy.

12:13.471 --> 12:15.430
Let's see if we can take it up
a level with, uh...

12:15.473 --> 12:18.476
Ooh, vibration.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.439
Man, you're stillin that thing?

12:24.482 --> 12:25.527
Hell yeah.

12:27.224 --> 12:28.922
The only downside is

12:28.965 --> 12:32.142
I'm vibrating so hard,
I see two of you.

12:32.186 --> 12:35.145
Well, I can't believe you're
okay fooling Mom like this.

12:35.189 --> 12:36.973
What kind of a husband
does that?

12:37.017 --> 12:39.062
A good one.

12:39.106 --> 12:40.498
You know,

12:40.542 --> 12:42.152
not every man cares enough

12:42.196 --> 12:44.459
to trick his wife
into being happy.

12:45.765 --> 12:49.072
Okay, well,I will see you guys later.

12:49.116 --> 12:50.334
All right. Where you going?

12:50.378 --> 12:52.510
Well, I'm gonna pop
over to see Gemma,

12:52.554 --> 12:53.729
then head to the market.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.384
I am making you
a special dinner tonight.

12:56.427 --> 12:57.559
What's the occasion?

12:57.602 --> 12:58.821
You are.

13:00.301 --> 13:02.259
You know,you giving up your massage chair

13:02.303 --> 13:04.000
just to make me happy
just reminded me

13:04.044 --> 13:06.568
of how lucky I am
to have a husband like you.

13:09.266 --> 13:11.181
Oh.

13:12.661 --> 13:14.054
Wow, Pop.

13:14.097 --> 13:16.796
Look how selflessMom is being.

13:16.839 --> 13:18.580
She must've learned that
from you.

13:19.886 --> 13:21.191
I'll see you later.

13:24.891 --> 13:27.154
How you feel now?

13:27.197 --> 13:28.590
Terrible.

13:28.633 --> 13:30.853
I'm sitting in a massage chair.

13:30.897 --> 13:32.899
I'm getting a special dinner.

13:32.942 --> 13:35.379
My wife loves me.

13:36.685 --> 13:38.687
Why does everything
happen to me?

13:40.689 --> 13:42.647
Hey, Tina.Hey, girl.

13:42.691 --> 13:44.040
I just stopped by to--

13:44.084 --> 13:46.390
Damn, Gemma!

13:47.348 --> 13:50.264
Why is there a cow on your wall?

13:51.961 --> 13:53.441
Dave insisted on putting it up.

13:53.484 --> 13:55.095
If there was
any room next to it,

13:55.138 --> 13:56.618
I'd put his head up there.

13:57.619 --> 13:59.142
Well, if you
hate it so much,

13:59.186 --> 14:00.840
then tell him
to take it down.

14:00.883 --> 14:04.800
I did, and he accused me
of being manipulative.

14:04.844 --> 14:05.975
Oh, wow.

14:06.019 --> 14:08.021
So he figured it out.

14:09.631 --> 14:11.589
Figured what out?

14:11.633 --> 14:13.722
That you manipulate
him sometimes.

14:13.765 --> 14:14.897
I do not.

14:14.941 --> 14:16.159
It's okay, Gemma.

14:16.203 --> 14:17.682
All good wives do.

14:17.726 --> 14:20.860
It's how we let our husbands
think they're in charge.

14:22.600 --> 14:23.558
You know what they say--

14:23.601 --> 14:25.777
sneaky wife, happy life.

14:25.821 --> 14:28.128
That's ridiculous.

14:28.171 --> 14:29.520
No, it's not.

14:29.564 --> 14:31.914
In fact,
I am manipulating Calvin

14:31.958 --> 14:33.568
right now.

14:33.611 --> 14:34.917
You are?

14:34.961 --> 14:37.702
Yeah. He tried to be slick
with our tax refund,

14:37.746 --> 14:40.836
but I saw his ass coming.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.230
Right now, he's
in his brand-new massage chair

14:43.273 --> 14:45.014
feeling like
the worst husband ever.

14:45.058 --> 14:47.016
And the only thing that's
gonna make him feel better

14:47.060 --> 14:48.235
is taking me to Italy.

14:48.278 --> 14:49.976
Home of Pinocchio,

14:50.019 --> 14:52.717
another puppet
who thought he was a real boy.

14:52.761 --> 14:56.069
Tina,that's terrible.Mm.

14:56.112 --> 14:58.941
Do you think
it would work for me?

14:58.985 --> 15:01.944
Nah. At this point, there's
only one thing you can do.

15:01.988 --> 15:04.773
You got to find something
that he hates just as much

15:04.816 --> 15:07.297
as you hate
that stupid thing.

15:07.341 --> 15:09.952
Well, there is one thing
he absolutely hates

15:09.996 --> 15:12.172
more than anything in the world.

15:12.215 --> 15:13.347
See? There you go.

15:13.390 --> 15:15.436
Now you're thinking
like a good wife.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.659
:Just put that over there.

15:24.184 --> 15:25.620
Hey, what are you guys doing?

15:25.663 --> 15:28.014
Pop had a change of heart.

15:29.667 --> 15:32.670
Yeah, I'm returning the chair.

15:32.714 --> 15:34.716
What?!

15:34.759 --> 15:38.502
I changed my mind, babe.
I'm taking you to Italy.

15:38.546 --> 15:41.244
Oh... Whoa, whoa.

15:41.288 --> 15:45.161
: Now, t-this is comingout of left field.

15:45.205 --> 15:48.121
You know, I just couldn't
accept this chair

15:48.164 --> 15:51.472
knowing that you gave up
what you wanted for me.

15:51.515 --> 15:53.996
Aw.

15:54.040 --> 15:57.565
Baby, I don't, I don't think
you should be doing this.

15:57.608 --> 16:00.307
Tina, I'm in charge here.

16:03.875 --> 16:06.008
And we are going to Italy.

16:06.052 --> 16:08.054
Okay.

16:08.097 --> 16:10.012
Uh-huh.

16:10.056 --> 16:12.449
You know I love a man
who's in control.

16:12.493 --> 16:14.451
Mm-hmm.

16:14.495 --> 16:17.237
Ooh! Oh, I am so excited.

16:17.280 --> 16:20.327
I'm-a put these groceries away
and then book that hotel.

16:20.370 --> 16:21.763
I mean, look at hotels.

16:26.768 --> 16:29.727
That's a good woman
right there, boy.

16:43.089 --> 16:44.829
Gemma!

16:46.092 --> 16:47.267
Hey, sweetie, what's up?

16:47.310 --> 16:49.182
What is your aunt's
creepy doll collection

16:49.225 --> 16:50.400
doing down here?

16:50.444 --> 16:52.402
Well, I was up in the attic

16:52.446 --> 16:54.404
and I came across themand I thought,

16:54.448 --> 16:56.798
"These would look great
in the living room," you know?

16:58.321 --> 17:00.062
You know that these dolls
freak me out.

17:00.106 --> 17:01.716
Are you honestly gonna tell me
that at least half of them

17:01.759 --> 17:03.065
didn't kill their owners?

17:03.109 --> 17:05.067
Well, they're not going anywhere

17:05.111 --> 17:06.851
until you takethat thing down.

17:06.895 --> 17:10.072
Okay, all right.
Nice try, Gemma.

17:10.116 --> 17:13.641
But it's not gonna work, becauseyou made a classic mistake.

17:13.684 --> 17:15.643
What?You brought dolls

17:15.686 --> 17:18.037
to a moose fight.

17:20.039 --> 17:23.477
If you think I made a mistake,you must have forgotten about...

17:24.478 --> 17:27.046
...Eleanor.

17:27.089 --> 17:29.483
Eleanor.

17:29.526 --> 17:33.052
I'd be careful what you say
in front of her, Dave.

17:33.095 --> 17:36.490
You know how mad she gets.

17:36.533 --> 17:38.840
Gemma, I'm serious.
I'm not afraid to hit a doll.

17:42.148 --> 17:43.975
DOLL :
Whee, let's play!

17:44.019 --> 17:45.499
No!

17:48.632 --> 17:50.460
Uh-oh, Dave.

17:50.504 --> 17:52.854
You hurt
Eleanor's friend.

17:52.897 --> 17:55.509
You better keep an eye out.

17:55.552 --> 17:57.511
Just like she does.

17:57.554 --> 17:59.991
Gemma, I'm not takingthat moose head down.

18:00.035 --> 18:01.602
What was that? Oh.

18:01.645 --> 18:03.821
Well, Eleanor told me
she's afraid of it,

18:03.865 --> 18:08.087
so she's gonna have
to sleep with us.

18:14.876 --> 18:15.877
Fine!

18:15.920 --> 18:19.185
Fine! I'll takethe moose head down.

18:19.228 --> 18:21.187
Thank you.

18:21.230 --> 18:23.841
Yeah, but just so you know,I'm n-- I'm not making this up.

18:23.885 --> 18:26.235
You make all
the decisions for us.

18:26.279 --> 18:27.845
That is not true.

18:27.889 --> 18:30.805
Yes, it is. Name one decision
that I've made around here.

18:30.848 --> 18:32.807
You picked the TV.

18:32.850 --> 18:34.809
Nope. I wanted a bigger screen.

18:34.852 --> 18:37.028
Okay. You picked the couch.

18:37.072 --> 18:38.378
No, I wanted leather.

18:38.421 --> 18:41.120
You said that I could
sit on my baseball glove.

18:42.860 --> 18:43.905
Okay, well,

18:43.948 --> 18:45.211
what about this tacky lamp?

18:45.254 --> 18:46.647
You must have picked that.

18:46.690 --> 18:48.736
That was a wedding gift
from your mother.

18:51.782 --> 18:54.307
I actually kind of like it.

18:54.350 --> 18:55.917
Oh, my God.

18:55.960 --> 18:59.138
Do I really make
all the decisions for us?

18:59.181 --> 19:01.618
Sometimes I wonder
if I even picked little spoon.

19:04.708 --> 19:07.102
Oh, sweetie.

19:07.146 --> 19:10.627
I had no ideaI was doing that to you.

19:10.671 --> 19:12.412
I am so sorry.

19:12.455 --> 19:16.024
It-It's okay, I-I didn't
realize you were, either.

19:16.067 --> 19:18.635
That's how good you are.

19:18.679 --> 19:22.117
Okay, well, now that I know,
I promise

19:22.161 --> 19:24.511
to do a better job
of listening to you.

19:24.554 --> 19:26.121
Thank you.

19:26.165 --> 19:29.342
And you promise not to put anymore severed heads on our wall?

19:31.822 --> 19:34.564
I'll try.

19:36.262 --> 19:38.916
Okay, I'll put the dolls away.

19:38.960 --> 19:42.224
All right. I'm gonna start
taking down this moose head.

19:42.268 --> 19:44.661
Or, there is something else
we could do.

19:44.705 --> 19:47.751
What's that?We could go upstairsand have sex.

19:47.795 --> 19:49.666
Like I said,
you always know best.

19:56.543 --> 19:58.719
Hey. Be gentle with her.

19:58.762 --> 20:00.155
And don't worry, girl.

20:00.199 --> 20:04.507
No matter how far they take you,I will find you.

20:06.292 --> 20:07.945
Hey, Calvin.

20:07.989 --> 20:09.512
Getting rid of the chair, huh?

20:09.556 --> 20:12.689
Yeah. Tina didn'twant me to, but, uh,

20:12.733 --> 20:14.300
I'm the man of the house.

20:14.343 --> 20:17.955
I'm the one who makes
our decisions.

20:17.999 --> 20:21.785
Looks like Gemma finally madeyou take down your moose.

20:21.829 --> 20:24.005
No. I decided to do it.

20:24.048 --> 20:26.964
After all,
I'm the man of the house, too.

20:27.008 --> 20:28.749
Well, good for you.

20:28.792 --> 20:32.492
ELEANOR:
Peekaboo. I see you.

20:32.535 --> 20:34.276
What's that?

20:41.457 --> 20:43.285
:It's Eleanor.

20:44.634 --> 20:46.245
Dave, it's just a dumb doll.

20:46.288 --> 20:47.637
Why are you so scared?

20:47.681 --> 20:51.293
Because I locked herin the attic 30 minutes ago.

20:51.337 --> 20:53.208
ELEANOR:
Hi, Calvin.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.036
Do you like to play?

20:56.907 --> 20:58.431
Oh, hell no.
That's the devil's toy!

20:58.474 --> 21:00.171
Go! Go, Dave!
