You’re too good
a detective.

00:12.120 --> 00:13.870

If you decide to see

I needed this equipment
to check on some pig carcasses

I submerged in several bodies
of water outside the city.

It’s the study

I didn’t hurt any of the pigs.

"One thing" often does.

Need I remind you
we had plans for that man?

No.
So you do realize

how sleeping with him
could affect those plans?

Sure, but...
No buts.

I thought you weren’t even
into Grimes.

01:40.620 --> 01:41.250
I’m not.

01:41.250 --> 01:42.990
Then what’s the big deal?
The big deal

01:42.990 --> 01:45.700
is that you have effectively
taken a player off the board,

01:45.700 --> 01:47.040

discussed it first.

The other day,
I thought we agreed

01:55.200 --> 01:56.620
that Lena Romero
was our top choice.

01:56.620 --> 01:59.290
We did. In point of fact,
I was planning to bring her

01:59.290 --> 02:01.370

this morning.

Now, just so
we’re clear, ma’am,

02:22.700 --> 02:24.000
Irma is one
of your chickens?

02:24.000 --> 02:25.990
Some people didn’t like
that we were here.

02:25.990 --> 02:27.790
They said this was
a community garden,

02:27.790 --> 02:30.500
not a community farm,
but I told them--

02:30.500 --> 02:33.620
the commercial egg farming
industry is a mess.

02:33.620 --> 02:34.990
The way they treat
their chickens...

02:34.990 --> 02:37.000
(sighs) it’s a disgrace.
If I’m going to eat eggs,

02:37.000 --> 02:40.250
I want to know they came from
chickens that were loved.

02:40.250 --> 02:41.830
Chickens that were happy.

02:41.830 --> 02:43.500
I’m assuming the threats
you mentioned

02:43.500 --> 02:44.830
came from your neighbors.

02:44.830 --> 02:45.830
One neighbor, really.

02:45.830 --> 02:47.990
And it wasn’t a threat
so much as a complaint.

to press charges.

Ma’am, when we pulled up,

symbols to distract

05:01.590 --> 05:03.760
law enforcement from the
true nature of their crimes.

05:03.760 --> 05:06.100
I myself worked a string
of murders in Brixton

to speak to someone.

06:07.590 --> 06:08.510
Why is that?

06:08.510 --> 06:10.590
Well, the captain was telling me
you already know

06:10.590 --> 06:14.430
that Gabriel was a professor
of religion, but has anyone

06:14.430 --> 06:16.680
spoken to you
about his other...

06:16.680 --> 06:18.600
job?

06:20.260 --> 06:21.680
He was an expert in the occult.

06:21.680 --> 06:27.510
He wrote extensively
on different arcane religions.

06:27.510 --> 06:29.300
Uh, Satanism,

06:29.300 --> 06:31.390
Santeria, Wicca.

06:31.390 --> 06:32.930
Whenever the
police or FBI

06:32.930 --> 06:36.930
came across a case
that had occult elements,

06:36.930 --> 06:38.430
they would ask for his help.

06:38.430 --> 06:40.720
He was able to
identify, for example,

06:40.720 --> 06:43.590
that a series
of pet mutilations in Illinois

06:43.590 --> 06:45.680
were the work of someone
who had read

06:45.680 --> 06:47.590
a passage in a Satanic text,

06:47.590 --> 06:48.470
and he traced it

06:48.470 --> 06:51.050
to the man
who had harmed the animals.

06:51.050 --> 06:53.050
Another time, he was asked

06:53.050 --> 06:56.470
to translate markings
that had been carved

06:56.470 --> 07:01.350
into the back of a woman
who was murdered.

07:01.350 --> 07:02.590
The message that he revealed

07:02.590 --> 07:04.800
led to the killer,
and he was arrested.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.590
Obviously,
you have not

07:06.590 --> 07:10.100
had a need for his expertise
here in the 11th.

07:10.100 --> 07:13.800
No. This is our first
occult killing.

07:14.550 --> 07:15.510
It’s my 20th.

07:15.510 --> 07:17.600
In my experience, Councilman,
the occult is used,

07:17.600 --> 07:20.590
more often than not, to
distract law enforcement.

07:20.590 --> 07:22.350
The criminals
who implement it

07:22.350 --> 07:23.260
want us to look one way

07:23.260 --> 07:25.590
while they shuffle off
in another.

07:26.010 --> 07:29.050
In my experience,
occult crimes equal

07:29.050 --> 07:29.850
occult criminals.

07:29.850 --> 07:32.010
They truly believe
in what they’re doing.

07:32.010 --> 07:33.970
What do you mean?

07:34.680 --> 07:38.350
Two years ago,
a grave was desecrated

07:38.350 --> 07:40.220
in a cemetery in my district.

07:40.220 --> 07:44.430
Someone broke into a crypt
and stole the skull of a man

07:44.430 --> 07:46.220
who had died
a few years earlier.

07:46.220 --> 07:48.100
That was how I met Gabriel.

07:48.100 --> 07:50.590
I was referred to him.
He thought it was

07:50.590 --> 07:53.970
a practitioner
of something called...

07:53.970 --> 07:55.140
Palo Mayombe.

07:55.140 --> 07:57.220
It’s a black magic offshoot
of Santeria.

07:57.220 --> 07:58.890
Notable for its pantheon
of colorful spirits

07:58.890 --> 08:01.010
and a belief
that certain vessels--

08:01.010 --> 08:05.470
human bones, in particular--
contain special powers.

08:05.800 --> 08:07.470
I’d never heard of it.

08:07.470 --> 08:08.430
Neither had the police.

08:08.430 --> 08:10.430
But they asked around,
and they discovered

08:10.430 --> 08:12.430
that a young man
who lived nearby had once

08:12.430 --> 08:14.590
claimed that it
was his religion.

08:14.590 --> 08:15.590
They went to his house.

08:15.590 --> 08:20.180
They found the skull in an
iron cauldron in the basement.

08:20.180 --> 08:22.590
Thanks to Gabriel,
the man is in prison,

08:22.590 --> 08:25.050
but what if he had followers?

08:25.590 --> 08:27.590
What if they killed Gabriel

08:27.590 --> 08:29.680
to avenge him?

08:30.220 --> 08:32.590
So, who’s up for a trip
to see the guy

08:32.590 --> 08:34.679
who stole the skull
two years ago?

08:34.679 --> 08:36.390
Watson is.
I am?

08:36.390 --> 08:37.590
Yeah. I’m gonna pay a visit

08:37.590 --> 08:38.850
to Jackson Heights
Community College,

08:38.850 --> 08:41.549
see if someone there can
point us in the direction

08:41.549 --> 08:43.590
of a suspect less absurd
than the disciple

08:43.590 --> 08:44.600

08:44.600 --> 08:48.100
But first, I have to talk

08:53.600 --> 08:55.350
Sure.
Yeah. Um...

08:55.350 --> 08:58.930
Would you agree I’m an
excellent judge of character?

08:58.930 --> 09:00.090
Sure.

09:00.090 --> 09:01.390
Well, I recently
had the pleasure

09:01.390 --> 09:03.600
of making the acquaintance
of a Lena Romero.

09:03.600 --> 09:05.600
She’s a detective
out of the 116th.

09:05.600 --> 09:07.890
Now, as it turns out,
she’s quite keen

09:07.890 --> 09:09.350
on a transfer here
to Major Cases.

09:09.350 --> 09:12.970
That’s great, but we don’t have
any openings right now.

09:12.970 --> 09:15.090
But you will. In just
a few short months,

09:15.090 --> 09:16.760
Marcus will be leaving us
for the U.S. Marshals.

09:16.760 --> 09:20.090
And you’ve been looking
for someone to replace him?

09:20.090 --> 09:21.390
Well, not just me.
Watson, too.

09:21.390 --> 09:23.090
She actually liked
a detective named Grimes,

09:23.090 --> 09:24.930
but he fell out of contention
late last night.

09:24.930 --> 09:27.260
Now, during the course
of her ten-year career,

09:27.260 --> 09:29.800
Detective Romero
has been awarded seven

09:29.800 --> 09:31.090
Excellent Police Duty Medals,

09:31.090 --> 09:32.890
five Meritorious
Police Duty Medals.

09:32.890 --> 09:34.600
She’s made over 350 arrests.

09:34.600 --> 09:35.430
Cut the crap, okay?

09:35.430 --> 09:37.640
You’re not looking
for the best cop for me.

09:37.640 --> 09:39.300
You’re looking
for the best cop for you.

09:39.300 --> 09:42.680
Someone that’ll work with
you guys the way Marcus has.

09:42.680 --> 09:45.640
Watson and I feel that,
in order to do our best work,

09:45.640 --> 09:46.760
the chemistry needs to be right.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.050
I think it’s less
about chemistry

09:48.050 --> 09:49.890
and more about
a willingness to work

09:49.890 --> 09:52.090
with a couple of civilians.

09:52.090 --> 09:53.100
Wouldn’t both be nice?

09:53.100 --> 09:57.390
What’s wrong with the detectives
that work here already?

09:57.390 --> 10:00.430
Nothing. They are, without
doubt, the best of the best.

10:00.430 --> 10:03.010
They’re reflections of
their captain in every way.

10:03.010 --> 10:04.640
It’s just...

10:04.640 --> 10:05.890
You annoy a lot of them.

10:05.890 --> 10:07.430
I annoy a lot of them.

10:09.100 --> 10:12.850
(door lock buzzing)

10:13.970 --> 10:15.260
Who is he again?

10:15.260 --> 10:16.680
Gabriel Rojas.

10:16.680 --> 10:18.050
He testified
at your trial.

10:18.050 --> 10:19.850
WATSON:
He’s the one
who told police

10:19.850 --> 10:21.090
about Palo Mayombe.

10:21.090 --> 10:22.550
Now, thanks to him,
they were able

10:22.550 --> 10:24.100
to figure out
that you were the one

10:24.100 --> 10:26.090
who stole the skull
from that crypt.

10:26.090 --> 10:27.140
Oh, yeah.

10:27.140 --> 10:29.890
I think he had a mustache
back then.

10:29.890 --> 10:31.180
You said someone
cut his head off?

10:31.180 --> 10:35.260
You can understand why we wanted
to talk to you, right?

10:35.260 --> 10:36.640
No. Not really.

10:36.640 --> 10:39.220
Two years ago,
you stole a skull.

10:39.220 --> 10:41.140
Now this guy
is missing his head.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.850
You think I killed him?

10:42.850 --> 10:44.390
What, you think I got, like,

10:44.390 --> 10:46.100
teleportation powers
or something?

10:46.100 --> 10:48.680
No. We don’t think
you’re the killer,

10:48.680 --> 10:50.640
but maybe you know
the person who is.

10:50.640 --> 10:51.640
Maybe you had followers

10:51.640 --> 10:53.300
back when you were
practicing Palo Mayombe

10:53.300 --> 10:55.800
and they didn’t like
what happened to you.

10:55.800 --> 10:56.890
(laughs)
"Followers"?

10:56.890 --> 10:59.350
Shoot.
I didn’t even have any friends.

10:59.350 --> 11:01.550
That’s the whole reason
why I did it.

11:01.550 --> 11:03.260
What do you mean?

11:03.260 --> 11:04.800
I had bullies, okay?

11:04.800 --> 11:08.260
Guys beat me up at school
like every day.

11:08.260 --> 11:09.470
I wanted it to stop.

11:09.470 --> 11:11.300
You thought performing
some ritual

11:11.300 --> 11:13.970
was gonna make them
leave you alone?

11:13.970 --> 11:14.680
Yeah.

11:14.680 --> 11:16.550
But not the way
you guys are thinking.

11:16.550 --> 11:18.090
I never even believed
in Palo Mayombe.

11:18.090 --> 11:20.600
It was just this freaky thing
my Cuban grandmother

11:20.600 --> 11:23.180
used to tell me stories of.
Scary stories.

11:23.180 --> 11:24.720
I thought that if
people thought

11:24.720 --> 11:26.050
I can curse them
or something,

11:26.050 --> 11:28.850
then maybe they’d
leave me alone.

11:28.850 --> 11:30.430
I told them I took the skull.

11:30.430 --> 11:31.800
I wanted them to know.

11:31.800 --> 11:33.220
It didn’t work out.

11:33.220 --> 11:37.090
I got beat up more,
and then I got arrested.

11:37.680 --> 11:40.640
Look, I’m sorry
this man is dead,

11:40.640 --> 11:43.970
but I had nothing to do with it.

11:51.090 --> 11:51.850
(door opens)

11:51.850 --> 11:54.180
(door closes,
footsteps approaching)

11:54.180 --> 11:57.550
How went your visit with
the high priest of Palo Mayombe?

11:57.550 --> 11:59.890
Poorly.
Marcus and I don’t think

11:59.890 --> 12:01.510
he had anything to do
with the murder.

12:01.510 --> 12:03.260
How’d it go
at the community college?

12:03.260 --> 12:05.220
Also poorly.
All I learned was that

12:05.220 --> 12:09.600
Professor Rojas was beloved
by students and faculty alike.

12:09.600 --> 12:10.850
According to them,
he didn’t have

12:10.850 --> 12:12.600
an enemy in the world,
supernatural or otherwise.

12:12.600 --> 12:14.010
Marcus reached out
to a few other

12:14.010 --> 12:16.010
occult experts around
the country, but none of them

12:16.010 --> 12:18.090
knew what to make
of the killer’s M.O.

12:18.090 --> 12:19.390
They thought
that he could be

12:19.390 --> 12:22.220
performing some kind
of a ritual.

12:22.680 --> 12:24.470
Or he could just be a nutter.

12:24.470 --> 12:26.300
How’d it go with the captain?

12:26.300 --> 12:29.010
He’s agreed to meet
with Detective Romero.

12:29.010 --> 12:30.760
Well, that’s great.
We’ll see.

12:30.760 --> 12:32.090
If she presents
as impressively to him

12:32.090 --> 12:34.470
as she did to us,
then we’re in good shape.

12:34.470 --> 12:35.760
And if she doesn’t?
Mmm.

12:35.760 --> 12:37.930
I suppose I’ll have
little choice but to sabotage

12:37.930 --> 12:39.430
Marcus’s training
with the Marshals.

12:39.430 --> 12:41.260
You’re joking, right?

12:41.260 --> 12:42.180
Probably.

12:42.180 --> 12:43.720
(glass shattering)

12:43.720 --> 12:45.090
What the hell was that?

12:45.090 --> 12:46.850
(dogs barking in distance)

12:55.390 --> 12:57.090
WATSON:
Anything?

12:57.090 --> 12:58.470
No. They ran away.

12:58.470 --> 13:00.180
(door closes)
Too much to hope

13:00.180 --> 13:04.180
we were the random targets
of some oblivious young vandal?

13:04.180 --> 13:06.800
Yeah, definitely.

13:18.470 --> 13:20.600
WATSON:
Father Vega.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.600
I’m Joan Watson.
This is Sherlock, my partner.

13:22.600 --> 13:23.300
We work with the NYPD.

13:23.300 --> 13:27.600
We’re investigating
the murder of Gabriel Rojas.

13:29.090 --> 13:30.470
You knew him?

13:30.470 --> 13:32.800
Gabriel was one of
my parishioners.

13:32.800 --> 13:34.390
He was also my friend.

13:34.390 --> 13:37.090
Do you know the particulars
of his murder?

13:37.090 --> 13:39.050
I know they took his head.

13:39.050 --> 13:40.430
They said so on the news.

13:40.430 --> 13:42.390
There is a rumor going
around the church

13:42.390 --> 13:44.680
that says this had something
to do with a case

13:44.680 --> 13:47.850
he assisted the police with
several years ago?

13:47.850 --> 13:49.010
Cerio Cristobal.

13:49.010 --> 13:50.890
The kid who took the skull
from the crypt.

13:50.890 --> 13:53.090
Yes, I believe
that is the name. Why?

13:53.090 --> 13:55.640
Well, we were hoping
that you could provide us

13:55.640 --> 13:57.180
with an alternate theory.

13:57.180 --> 13:58.600
Me?

13:58.600 --> 13:59.970
Yeah.

13:59.970 --> 14:01.350
Someone...

14:01.350 --> 14:05.090
threw this
through our window last night.

14:08.430 --> 14:11.300
I’m sorry, I do not know
who killed Gabriel.

14:11.300 --> 14:14.100
But I do know who the
person who wrote this note

14:14.100 --> 14:16.090
thinks is responsible.

14:17.010 --> 14:19.180
The name is on the bottle.

14:21.260 --> 14:23.760
Champerico Rum?

14:28.890 --> 14:30.000
VEGA:
Gabriel, like myself,

14:30.020 --> 14:31.140
is originally from Guatemala.

14:32.040 --> 14:36.210
Champerico Rum has a distillery
and a bottling plant there.

14:36.210 --> 14:37.840
Provides many jobs,

14:37.840 --> 14:39.550
but the conditions are very bad.

14:39.550 --> 14:41.460
Workers who have tried
to unionize

14:41.460 --> 14:43.250
are targeted by the MAGL.

14:43.250 --> 14:46.880
Movimiento Armado para
una Guatemala Libre.

14:46.880 --> 14:48.130
It’s a paramilitary group.

14:48.130 --> 14:50.040
"Armed Movement
for a Free Guatemala."

14:50.040 --> 14:52.420
Some workers have been beaten
by their soldiers.

14:52.420 --> 14:54.040
Others have been killed.

14:54.040 --> 14:56.840
Now, why would
a paramilitary group care

14:56.840 --> 15:00.170
if Champerico workers
are trying to unionize?

15:00.170 --> 15:01.710
That is a good question.

15:01.710 --> 15:02.960
The prevailing theory is that

15:02.960 --> 15:07.300
MAGL has an arrangement
with Champerico Rum.

15:07.300 --> 15:09.750
They are paid
to terrorize the workers.

15:09.750 --> 15:12.210
Not an uncommon practice
in that part of the world.

15:12.210 --> 15:14.550
Whatever the price,
I’m sure it’s far less

15:14.550 --> 15:16.710
than allowing a union to form.

15:16.710 --> 15:18.920
So, why would Champerico
have wanted to kill Gabriel?

15:18.920 --> 15:21.210
Gabriel had a nephew
who worked at the plant.

15:21.210 --> 15:24.340
Ivan. When Ivan tried
to organize a walkout,

15:24.340 --> 15:25.500
MAGL soldiers dragged him

15:25.500 --> 15:27.840
from his home,
drove away in a car.

15:27.840 --> 15:30.380
He has not been
heard from again.

15:31.040 --> 15:32.340
Gabriel, he
stayed in touch

15:32.340 --> 15:36.040
with his friends,
one of them a woman.

15:36.040 --> 15:37.040
Valentina Duran.

15:37.040 --> 15:39.300
She was exceptionally bright,
exceptionally strong.

15:39.300 --> 15:41.960
She, like Ivan, worked
at the Champerico plant.

15:41.960 --> 15:44.590
And like Ivan,
she was determined

15:44.590 --> 15:46.550
to see a union form.

15:46.550 --> 15:48.170
Gabriel and I put
her in contact

15:48.170 --> 15:49.880
with an American group,

15:49.880 --> 15:52.130
a federation of unions
who does work

15:52.130 --> 15:54.090
to organize labor
in other countries.

15:54.090 --> 15:58.130
Two weeks ago, she came
here to meet with them

15:58.130 --> 16:00.500
and promptly disappeared.

16:01.630 --> 16:03.040
So you think

16:03.040 --> 16:04.040
whoever threw that bottle

16:04.040 --> 16:06.460
believes that Champerico
was responsible.

16:06.460 --> 16:09.210
Gabriel and I certainly
found it suspicious.

16:09.210 --> 16:13.210
The police looked into
Valentina’s disappearance

16:13.210 --> 16:15.210
but came up with very little.

16:15.210 --> 16:16.250
Gabriel, as you
know, has some

16:16.250 --> 16:18.040
experience with
criminal investigation.

16:18.040 --> 16:20.800
He decided to look into
the matter himself.

16:20.800 --> 16:24.210
Perhaps he came too
close to the truth.

16:27.630 --> 16:29.090
GREGSON:
Detective Romero?

16:29.090 --> 16:30.340
Captain Tom Gregson.

16:30.340 --> 16:32.090
Good to meet you.
Likewise.

16:32.090 --> 16:35.170
Come on.
We’ll talk in my office.

16:40.090 --> 16:41.630
Please.

16:41.630 --> 16:43.800
Have a seat.

16:46.250 --> 16:47.880
I, um... I have to admit,

16:47.880 --> 16:50.210
when Sherlock and
Joan approached me,

16:50.210 --> 16:52.170
I thought it was a joke.

16:52.170 --> 16:55.670
Two civilians headhunting
for Major Case.

16:55.670 --> 16:56.750
(chuckles quietly)

16:56.750 --> 16:59.040
But then I looked into them
and saw the work

16:59.040 --> 17:00.340
they’ve done here.
I was impressed.

17:00.340 --> 17:03.040
Well, obviously, they felt
the same way about you,

17:03.040 --> 17:05.170
or you wouldn’t be sitting
in that chair.

17:05.170 --> 17:08.040
You did some really
good work at the 116.

17:08.040 --> 17:09.839
Why do you want to leave?

17:09.839 --> 17:11.589
It’s less about leaving there

17:11.589 --> 17:13.339
and more about wanting
to come here.

17:13.339 --> 17:15.089
The work that gets
done here, it’s...

17:15.089 --> 17:17.170
some of the most important
in the city.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.000
I want to be a part of it.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.589
You like the limelight, Romero?

17:22.040 --> 17:23.800
No, sir.
It-it’s not like that.

17:23.800 --> 17:26.170
I’m not looking
to shine my star.

17:26.630 --> 17:28.250
I want to
challenge myself.

17:28.250 --> 17:29.710
I want to help people.

17:29.710 --> 17:30.710
Speaking of helping--

17:30.710 --> 17:33.750
how much did Joan and Sherlock
tell you about

17:33.750 --> 17:34.880
what they do here?

17:34.880 --> 17:35.880
They broke it all down.

17:35.880 --> 17:38.380
They said they’re only here
by your good graces

17:38.380 --> 17:40.040
and they lend a hand
when you ask them to.

17:40.040 --> 17:42.590
So they made it clear that if
this were to work out,

17:42.590 --> 17:44.670
you work for me, not for them.
Crystal.

17:44.670 --> 17:48.040
They’re good-- I can tell--
but they are...

17:48.040 --> 17:51.090
they aren’t sworn members
of this department.

17:51.090 --> 17:52.040
Your old C.O.,

17:52.040 --> 17:56.750
Moira Baker, and I--
we came on the job together.

17:56.750 --> 17:58.040
Oh, yeah?
Mm-hmm.

17:58.040 --> 17:59.710
I’m gonna be talking
to her about you,

17:59.710 --> 18:03.420
and if she likes you
as much as Joan and Sherlock,

18:03.420 --> 18:04.380
who knows?

18:04.380 --> 18:07.040
Maybe you got a future here.

18:08.840 --> 18:10.750
Is there a problem?

18:10.750 --> 18:11.800
No.

18:11.800 --> 18:16.340
It’s just that if you’re gonna
be talking to Lieutenant Baker,

18:16.340 --> 18:18.130
then there is something
you should know.

18:18.130 --> 18:21.460
Something I didn’t tell
Sherlock and Joan.

18:22.300 --> 18:24.710
WOMAN: That’s Valentina’s
passport photo.

18:24.710 --> 18:26.090
I gave it to the other police,

18:26.090 --> 18:28.040
but I thought
you might want it, too.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.250
You’re the one who
reported her missing, right?

18:30.250 --> 18:33.170
My group had arranged
all her travel to New York.

18:33.170 --> 18:35.090
We were supposed to meet
at our headquarters

18:35.090 --> 18:36.170
the day after she arrived.

18:36.170 --> 18:37.300
When she didn’t show,

18:37.300 --> 18:38.040
I called the hotel.

18:38.040 --> 18:39.210
They told me
she never checked in.

18:39.210 --> 18:42.000
That’s when I
called the police.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.340
It’s our understanding
that your group

18:43.340 --> 18:45.840
helps workers unionize
in other countries.

18:45.840 --> 18:47.500
Valentina was coming here
so that we

18:47.500 --> 18:48.630
could help her
strategize.

18:48.630 --> 18:50.250
The way Champerico
treats its workers

18:50.250 --> 18:51.170
is unconscionable.

18:51.170 --> 18:52.250
We wanted things to change.

18:52.250 --> 18:54.040
I have to admit,
I’m a little surprised

18:54.040 --> 18:56.500
an American labor group
would be so interested

18:56.500 --> 18:59.630
in helping workers unionize
in other countries.

18:59.630 --> 19:00.300
Why is that?

19:00.300 --> 19:02.050
Maybe because so many
American jobs

19:02.050 --> 19:04.420
have gone to other countries.
Respectfully,

19:04.420 --> 19:06.710
that’s a very old-school way
of looking at it.

19:06.710 --> 19:08.880
Most of us get that
those jobs are gone.

19:08.880 --> 19:10.130
They’re not coming back.

19:10.130 --> 19:12.050
Business globalization
is here to stay.

19:12.050 --> 19:14.500
The way to fight it is
labor globalization.

19:14.500 --> 19:17.670
That means pushing to improve
conditions everywhere,

19:17.670 --> 19:18.880
not just in the U.S.

19:18.880 --> 19:20.130
When wages in other
countries go up,

19:20.130 --> 19:23.250
job migration is less attractive
to the big companies.

19:23.250 --> 19:24.300
More work stays here.

19:24.300 --> 19:27.750
Ultimately, are we serving
our own self-interests?

19:27.750 --> 19:30.210
Yeah. But in the meantime,
we get to give help

19:30.210 --> 19:31.630
to a lot of people who need it.

19:31.630 --> 19:35.250
In Valentina’s case,
we were too late.

19:35.630 --> 19:39.800
Champerico has committed crimes
in New York before, okay?

19:39.800 --> 19:41.040
Like what?

19:41.040 --> 19:42.460
Remember last year,

19:42.460 --> 19:44.880
when that grassroots group
was pushing the city council

19:44.880 --> 19:47.460
to increase the excise tax
on alcohol?

19:47.460 --> 19:48.250
WATSON:
Yes.

19:48.250 --> 19:49.460
That money was supposed to go

19:49.460 --> 19:51.380
to addiction-focused health care
and recovery support.

19:51.380 --> 19:53.040
In the end,
the tax was voted down,

19:53.040 --> 19:55.920
but for months before,
the people fighting for that tax

19:55.920 --> 19:58.000
got hundreds
of threatening phone calls.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.040
"I know where you live."

19:59.040 --> 20:00.130
"I know where your
children go to school."

20:00.130 --> 20:02.880
A few reported being followed
by a car with tinted windows.

20:02.880 --> 20:05.380
One woman managed to write
down a license plate.

20:05.380 --> 20:08.960
Guess who the police were
able to trace it back to.

20:08.960 --> 20:09.550
Champerico.

20:09.550 --> 20:10.880
They said the
car was stolen.

20:10.880 --> 20:12.840
The police couldn’t prove
they were lying,

20:12.840 --> 20:13.800
so they had to drop it.

20:13.800 --> 20:15.840
WATSON: Okay, but the tax
you’re talking about

20:15.840 --> 20:18.040
would have affected all
alcohol beverage companies,

20:18.040 --> 20:18.960
not just Champerico,

20:18.960 --> 20:21.040
so why would they have
taken it so personally?

20:21.040 --> 20:22.750
They’re smaller.
Family-owned.

20:22.750 --> 20:26.040
The tax would have hurt them
more than the big conglomerates,

20:26.040 --> 20:27.300
so they did what
they had to.

20:27.300 --> 20:30.750
Just like they did
with Valentina.

20:33.920 --> 20:37.130
MAN:
That one’s one of my favorites.

20:37.130 --> 20:39.040
It’s from 1963.

20:39.040 --> 20:43.800
Back then, these were posted
all over the city.

20:43.800 --> 20:46.460
Few years later,
my dad passed away.

20:46.460 --> 20:49.090
My mom told marketing
to take the devil

20:49.090 --> 20:51.170
out of all of our ads.

20:51.170 --> 20:53.590
"Sacrilegious," she said.
That’s a shame.

20:53.590 --> 20:56.550
Seems like a good marriage
between pitchman and product.

20:56.550 --> 20:57.590
(chuckles)
Sherlock Holmes.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.590
Thank you for taking the time
to meet with me.

20:59.590 --> 21:01.250
Hey.
When Morland Holmes asks you

21:01.250 --> 21:03.040
to take a meeting,
you take a meeting.

21:03.040 --> 21:04.750
About that.
Uh, the e-mail you received

21:04.750 --> 21:06.050
didn’t actually come
from my father.

21:06.050 --> 21:09.420
I hacked his account.
The message was from me.

21:10.840 --> 21:11.550
Okay.

21:11.550 --> 21:13.210
My father’s name holds weight
with all the wrong

21:13.210 --> 21:14.880
kinds of people.
I’m not saying that you were

21:14.880 --> 21:17.040
one of them, of course, but
as the owner of a company

21:17.040 --> 21:19.250
with profits in excess
of a billion dollars last year,

21:19.250 --> 21:20.130
seemed like a safe bet.

21:20.130 --> 21:21.880
The truth is,
Mr. Treadwell,

21:21.880 --> 21:23.500
I’m here to discuss
the disappearance

21:23.500 --> 21:26.590
of a woman
named Valentina Duran.

21:27.040 --> 21:28.750
I’m sorry.
I don’t know that name.

21:28.750 --> 21:31.300
Next, you’ll be telling me that
you don’t pay paramilitaries

21:31.300 --> 21:35.420
to crush the labor movement
at your distillery in Guatemala.

21:36.250 --> 21:38.840
(chuckles)

21:40.250 --> 21:43.130
Nancy, would you get security
in here, please?

21:43.130 --> 21:44.880
Right away, Mr. Treadwell.

21:44.880 --> 21:46.670
Now, if I were you,

21:46.670 --> 21:47.920
I’d leave before they get here.

21:47.920 --> 21:50.300
Actually, I was hoping to
meet some of your henchmen.

21:50.300 --> 21:52.630
I was wondering if one of them
was the person

21:52.630 --> 21:55.000
who cut Gabriel Rojas’s
head off.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.250
What?

21:56.250 --> 21:57.040
Gabriel Rojas.

21:57.040 --> 21:59.460
He was decapitated
two nights ago.

21:59.460 --> 22:01.040
Left in a garden.

22:01.040 --> 22:02.380
The guy on the news?

22:02.380 --> 22:03.500
Yeah. He was
investigating

22:03.500 --> 22:06.880
the disappearance
of Valentina Duran.

22:07.170 --> 22:09.710
Um, Nancy, forget security.

22:09.710 --> 22:11.710
Everything’s fine in here.

22:11.710 --> 22:13.040
Understood.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.920
You think we beheaded someone
because he was

22:15.920 --> 22:18.590
looking into what happened
to Valentina Duran.

22:18.590 --> 22:20.550
So the name rings a bell,
does it?

22:20.550 --> 22:22.420
Oh, you’ve got a problem.

22:22.420 --> 22:24.500
We didn’t have
anything to do

22:24.500 --> 22:27.040
with what happened to Ms. Duran.

22:27.040 --> 22:29.380
And I can prove it.

22:31.210 --> 22:32.130
(cell phone ringing)

22:32.130 --> 22:34.040
Hey, I was just about
to call you.

22:34.040 --> 22:35.040
HOLMES: Yeah?
Yeah.

22:35.040 --> 22:36.710
Marcus and I just wrapped up
with the woman

22:36.710 --> 22:39.420
who reported Valentina Duran’s
disappearance.

22:39.420 --> 22:40.920
I think Gabriel Rojas was right

22:40.920 --> 22:42.840
to think that Champerico
was behind it.

22:42.840 --> 22:44.040
Yeah, of course he was.

22:44.040 --> 22:45.170
Only one problem.

22:45.170 --> 22:47.880
Champerico didn’t kill her.

22:47.880 --> 22:49.040
Are you sure?

22:49.040 --> 22:50.840
Yeah, I’m positive.
I just watched her

22:50.840 --> 22:52.460
take out her rubbish.

22:57.200 --> 23:00.860
I live here with five
other women from my country.

23:00.860 --> 23:01.610
They have jobs.

23:01.610 --> 23:03.360
I’m still looking.
I have faith.

23:03.760 --> 23:06.760
My English is good,
and I’m a hard worker.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.390
You ran away when you got
to New York. Why?

23:08.390 --> 23:10.840
Two months ago,
I learned I was pregnant.

23:10.840 --> 23:11.970
The father
and I decided

23:11.970 --> 23:13.850
the best thing for our child
was for me

23:13.850 --> 23:15.930
to leave Guatemala
and never go back.

23:15.930 --> 23:18.840
There, I was the target
of many threats.

23:18.840 --> 23:21.300
I was followed
wherever I went.

23:21.300 --> 23:23.840
We both knew it was only
a matter of time

23:23.840 --> 23:24.840
before the MAGL soldiers

23:24.840 --> 23:26.600
came for me, so...

23:26.600 --> 23:28.470
we made a plan.

23:28.470 --> 23:29.840
I would take advantage

23:29.840 --> 23:30.970
of my trip
to New York.

23:30.970 --> 23:33.430
I would come here,
and I would disappear.

23:33.430 --> 23:36.840
Champerico would never
know what happened to me.

23:36.840 --> 23:38.840
Well, I’m sorry to say
that Champerico knows

23:38.840 --> 23:40.840
exactly what happened to you--
’cause they’re the ones

23:40.840 --> 23:42.220
who gave me
this address.

23:42.220 --> 23:43.890
What?
Their surveillance
was not

23:43.890 --> 23:46.140
limited to Guatemala,
so the second you arrived

23:46.140 --> 23:48.430
at JFK, their people
were watching you.

23:48.430 --> 23:50.840
HOLMES:
If it’s any
consolation,

23:50.840 --> 23:51.850
they seemed to be very pleased

23:51.850 --> 23:53.840
that you decided
to disappear yourself.

23:53.840 --> 23:55.930
You seem to have saved them
the trouble.

23:55.930 --> 23:57.430
We know you
were friends

23:57.430 --> 23:59.970
with the nephew of a man
named Gabriel Rojas.

23:59.970 --> 24:02.600
Were you aware that he
was killed the other night?

24:02.600 --> 24:03.720
HOLMES:
Of course she was.

24:03.720 --> 24:07.430
She’s the one who threw
the bottle through our window.

24:07.840 --> 24:09.050
This writing is a match

24:09.050 --> 24:09.970
for the message
we received.

24:09.970 --> 24:11.100
It’s yours, isn’t it?

24:11.100 --> 24:13.260
How did you know
where we lived?

24:13.260 --> 24:17.010
When Gabriel had died, I looked
for more news on my phone.

24:17.010 --> 24:20.840
Beneath one of the articles,
in the comments section,

24:20.840 --> 24:22.760
one of Gabriel’s students said

24:22.760 --> 24:25.720
there was a detective
named Sherlock Holmes

24:25.720 --> 24:26.840
who had given his
business card.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.800
Our address
isn’t on my business card.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.180
I did a search for your name.

24:30.180 --> 24:32.720
I found your address
on a Web site

24:32.720 --> 24:34.840
for something
called, uh...

24:34.840 --> 24:35.180
ESOOPI?

24:35.180 --> 24:38.260
The Empire State Order
of Private Investigators.

24:38.260 --> 24:39.720
Our address is on
their Web site?

24:39.720 --> 24:41.930
So you sent us to Father Vega
because you knew

24:41.930 --> 24:43.430
he would tell us
about Champerico.

24:43.430 --> 24:46.840
You think they were behind
Gabriel’s murder. Why?

24:46.840 --> 24:49.550
Three days ago,
Gabriel found me.

24:49.550 --> 24:51.010
I begged him
to forgive me

24:51.010 --> 24:53.350
for abandoning our cause, but...

24:53.350 --> 24:54.720
he said he understood.

24:54.720 --> 24:57.850
He told me he would
keep my secret.

24:57.850 --> 24:59.550
He was a very good man.

24:59.550 --> 25:01.970
WATSON:
Now, we thought
that Champerico Rum

25:01.970 --> 25:02.840
was behind Gabriel’s murder

25:02.840 --> 25:04.840
because he was investigating
your disappearance.

25:04.840 --> 25:06.930
They didn’t want him
exposing what they had done,

25:06.930 --> 25:08.840
except they hadn’t
done anything.

25:08.840 --> 25:11.010
They knew you were alive
this whole time,

25:11.010 --> 25:13.390
so why would they
have killed Gabriel?

25:13.390 --> 25:16.760
Because I gave him something.

25:17.180 --> 25:19.720
Something very dangerous.

25:20.840 --> 25:23.840
On the left,
soldiers of the MAGL.

25:23.840 --> 25:26.600
On the right,
men working private security

25:26.600 --> 25:29.720
for the Champerico management
in Guatemala City.

25:29.720 --> 25:31.180
Look at the tattoos.

25:31.180 --> 25:32.930
Here and here.

25:32.930 --> 25:35.140
They are the same man.

25:35.140 --> 25:36.850
The other workers

25:36.850 --> 25:37.840
at the plant and I,

25:37.840 --> 25:40.140
we pooled our money
and hired a detective.

25:40.140 --> 25:41.840
We asked him to
help us prove

25:41.840 --> 25:43.840
there is a link
between Champerico

25:43.840 --> 25:44.840
and the MAGL.

25:44.840 --> 25:46.840
He took the pictures
on the right.

25:46.840 --> 25:49.470
When we compared them
to the pictures

25:49.470 --> 25:50.850
we already had
of the soldiers,

25:50.850 --> 25:52.350
we found
many similarities.

25:52.350 --> 25:56.840
Whenever our people are hurt
or killed by the MAGL,

25:56.840 --> 26:01.350
Champerico says
it’s a coincidence.

26:01.840 --> 26:04.300
But these photos show
the soldiers

26:04.300 --> 26:06.840
are on the company’s payroll.

26:06.840 --> 26:07.930
They work
as bodyguards.

26:07.930 --> 26:09.600
I believe you,
but unfortunately,

26:09.600 --> 26:12.390
the quality of many
of these photographs is poor.

26:12.390 --> 26:14.640
Even if it weren’t,
Champerico could say

26:14.640 --> 26:17.430
that these men hid the fact
that they were soldiers.

26:17.430 --> 26:19.470
Gabriel said the same thing.

26:19.470 --> 26:20.430
But before he left,

26:20.430 --> 26:22.100
he asked me
to send these to him.

26:22.100 --> 26:24.050
He said he would keep
studying them,

26:24.050 --> 26:27.840
see if he could find
anything useful.

26:28.390 --> 26:31.550
The next day, he was murdered.

26:32.430 --> 26:35.840
That can’t be
just a coincidence.

26:36.680 --> 26:38.350
Moira.

26:38.350 --> 26:39.300
(chuckles)

26:39.300 --> 26:41.840
I am... I’m so sorry I’m late.

26:41.840 --> 26:43.640
Forget it. I know
how the job is.

26:43.640 --> 26:48.010
Oh, I thought you would have
blocked it out by now.

26:48.010 --> 26:49.390
So...

26:49.390 --> 26:52.100
how’s private security
treating you?

26:52.100 --> 26:55.100
Well, I’m expensing this pinot
in the middle of the day.

26:55.100 --> 26:57.050
Does that answer your question?

26:57.840 --> 26:58.840
Greener pastures, Tommy.

26:58.840 --> 26:59.850
You should think about it.

26:59.850 --> 27:02.010
I get to take my pension,
salary’s great,

27:02.010 --> 27:05.470
and I finally
leave work at work.

27:05.470 --> 27:10.220
Do me a favor-- don’t ever
mention that to my wife.

27:10.220 --> 27:11.600
So, what’s up?

27:11.600 --> 27:13.180
Why’d you want to see me?

27:13.180 --> 27:15.100
Lena Romero.

27:15.100 --> 27:17.840
Thinking about her
for Major Case?

27:17.840 --> 27:19.760
Mm-hmm.
That’s terrific.

27:19.760 --> 27:22.680
So, she’s got your mark?
Absolutely.

27:22.680 --> 27:25.510
But you already knew that,
so why are you here?

27:26.100 --> 27:28.140
You’ve seen her
annual evaluations,

27:28.140 --> 27:30.640
and I could’ve given you
the thumbs-up on the phone.

27:30.640 --> 27:32.140
There was an incident
she told me about.

27:32.140 --> 27:33.800
Happened when she was first
starting out.

27:33.800 --> 27:36.840
She and her partner pulled over
someone on an open warrant.

27:36.840 --> 27:39.970
The partner thought he saw
the guy go for a gun,

27:39.970 --> 27:41.100
so he opened fire.

27:41.100 --> 27:42.140
Turned out there was no gun.

27:42.140 --> 27:46.180
So he planted one
from his own glove box.

27:46.840 --> 27:49.180
And Romero went along with it.

27:49.180 --> 27:51.260
I remember.

27:52.050 --> 27:53.890
She was still green.

27:53.890 --> 27:55.260
Tough spot to be in.

27:55.260 --> 27:56.930
But she came clean.

27:56.930 --> 27:58.640
A week later.

27:58.640 --> 27:59.800
Still, she got in front of it.

27:59.800 --> 28:02.220
And I notice she told
you about it, too.

28:02.220 --> 28:03.050
Yeah, she did.

28:03.050 --> 28:04.970
And believe me...

28:04.970 --> 28:06.640
that means something.

28:06.640 --> 28:09.840
But I gotta know--
was this an isolated case?

28:09.840 --> 28:14.140
Or were there other
incidents like that?

28:14.140 --> 28:15.350
Lena’s creative.

28:15.350 --> 28:19.550
That’s part of why she
closes so many cases.

28:19.550 --> 28:20.850
But she keeps her nose clean.

28:20.850 --> 28:23.300
She knows where the line is.

28:23.300 --> 28:25.600
"Creative."

28:26.140 --> 28:29.800
What exactly
is that supposed to mean?

28:34.840 --> 28:37.760
And you’ve turned all the
pictures upside down.

28:37.760 --> 28:39.840
I thought we needed
a new perspective.

28:39.840 --> 28:43.300
Because bats have solved
so many homicides.

28:43.300 --> 28:44.800
I have another idea.

28:44.800 --> 28:45.840
Maybe we’re not seeing anything

28:45.840 --> 28:47.760
in these pictures
worth killing over

28:47.760 --> 28:48.680
because there is nothing

28:48.680 --> 28:50.140
worth killing over
in these pictures.

28:50.140 --> 28:52.430
I must concede
that is a distinct possibility.

28:52.430 --> 28:54.600
If there’s any great secret
that Champerico Rum

28:54.600 --> 28:57.840
wants to keep under wraps,
I can’t imagine what it is yet.

28:57.840 --> 28:59.930
Could be you’re right.

28:59.930 --> 29:02.840
Maybe we’re looking
at this whole thing

29:02.840 --> 29:03.850
from the wrong angle.

29:03.850 --> 29:07.260
Maybe we’re overlooking
the most obvious suspect.

29:07.260 --> 29:08.430
Valentina Duran.

29:08.430 --> 29:10.510
Think about it-- she’s
been living in hiding.

29:10.510 --> 29:11.850
Maybe she panicked
when Gabriel found her,

29:11.850 --> 29:14.840
and then killed him, and then
dumped him in that garden.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.800
If she killed him,
why did she throw

29:16.800 --> 29:17.720
a bottle through our window?

29:17.720 --> 29:19.840
Maybe she wanted Champerico
to take the blame

29:19.840 --> 29:22.430
and she knew that Father Vega
would point us

29:22.430 --> 29:25.140
in their direction and not hers.

29:25.140 --> 29:27.300
Or maybe I need sleep.

29:27.300 --> 29:28.510
That seems more likely.

29:28.510 --> 29:30.640
All right,
let’s just call it a night.

29:30.640 --> 29:34.840
And we’ll just look at this
with fresh eyes tomorrow.

29:36.890 --> 29:40.850
This is how a bat
would look at the problem.

29:40.850 --> 29:43.760
(cell phone rings)

29:47.390 --> 29:49.010
Marcus, it’s late.
You’re either calling

29:49.010 --> 29:51.010
with very good news
or very bad news.

29:51.010 --> 29:52.350
I guess that sort of depends.

29:52.350 --> 29:54.350
Gabriel Rojas’s head
just turned up.

29:54.350 --> 29:57.760
Thought you and Joan
would want to come see it.

29:57.970 --> 30:00.010
BELL:
Some homeless people sleep here

30:00.010 --> 30:01.680
when it’s not too cold.

30:01.680 --> 30:03.350
One of them found this

30:03.350 --> 30:03.850
and freaked.

30:03.850 --> 30:05.840
Which is understandable,
of course.

30:05.840 --> 30:06.840
Looks like our killer

30:06.840 --> 30:08.720
was performing some kind
of ritual.

30:08.720 --> 30:13.010
Or they’re just trying
to distract us again.

30:15.100 --> 30:18.050
He looks different
without the toupee, huh?

30:18.050 --> 30:19.840
So that is him?

30:19.840 --> 30:20.840
Councilman Ledesma.

30:20.840 --> 30:22.890
Captain gave him a
call as a courtesy,

30:22.890 --> 30:23.850
and he came right over.

30:23.850 --> 30:24.840
But I bet he’ll be gone

30:24.840 --> 30:26.890
by the time the news vans
get here.

30:26.890 --> 30:27.930
You know how politicians are.

30:27.930 --> 30:29.680
He won’t want any
of the cameras

30:29.680 --> 30:30.840
seeing his bald spot.

30:30.840 --> 30:32.840
Well, one already did.

30:33.140 --> 30:37.800
And it’s going to help us prove
that he killed Gabriel Rojas.

30:47.040 --> 30:48.040
Detective.

30:48.040 --> 30:50.550
I came straight over
when I got your message.

30:50.550 --> 30:52.590
This is Maxine,
my chief of staff.

30:52.590 --> 30:53.590
Pleasure.

30:53.590 --> 30:55.000
You said that
there was news

30:55.000 --> 30:56.040
about Gabriel’s case?

30:56.040 --> 30:57.630
A lot of news, actually.

30:57.630 --> 30:59.960
But I think it’s best
if Maxine wait out here.

30:59.960 --> 31:01.750
Some of what we have
to show you...

31:01.750 --> 31:02.750
it’s pretty graphic.

31:02.750 --> 31:05.040
Some might call it
hair-raising.

31:05.040 --> 31:07.040
Of course.

31:12.920 --> 31:14.960
HOLMES: Councilman.
I don’t know how much

31:14.960 --> 31:17.040
you paid for your toupee,
but I just wanted

31:17.040 --> 31:19.170
to assure you it was worth it.

31:19.170 --> 31:21.800
Um... thank you?

31:21.800 --> 31:23.840
When you sat here
the other day,

31:23.840 --> 31:25.960
your hairpiece had me fooled.

31:26.090 --> 31:27.750
If it hadn’t,
I would have realized

31:27.750 --> 31:30.130
that you murdered Gabriel Rojas
much sooner.

31:30.130 --> 31:31.050
What?

31:31.050 --> 31:32.300
What the hell is this?

31:32.300 --> 31:33.920
WATSON:
The day before he died,

31:33.920 --> 31:36.090
Gabriel received
a collection of photos.

31:36.090 --> 31:38.000
They were gathered
from workers

31:38.000 --> 31:40.130
in Guatemala
from a rum plant.

31:40.130 --> 31:41.090
Now, they believe

31:41.090 --> 31:42.880
that their employer
was in bed

31:42.880 --> 31:44.090
with a paramilitary group.

31:44.090 --> 31:46.170
Now, the person who
gave him the photos

31:46.170 --> 31:48.750
thinks he was
killed over them.

31:48.750 --> 31:49.380
That seemed unlikely.

31:49.380 --> 31:51.630
We studied them for hours,
and we could find

31:51.630 --> 31:53.040
little that would hurt
the rum company.

31:53.040 --> 31:55.630
But when we saw you in
your natural state last night,

31:55.630 --> 31:57.340
we realized that there were
some images

31:57.340 --> 31:58.380
that could be harmful to you.

31:58.880 --> 32:01.340
WATSON: Now, the person
who took these photos

32:01.340 --> 32:03.210
was focusing on
the bodyguard,

32:03.210 --> 32:04.710
but they could not help
but catch

32:04.710 --> 32:05.750
the meeting that
was going on

32:05.750 --> 32:08.090
between the
bodyguard’s employer

32:08.090 --> 32:10.300
and this man.

32:10.540 --> 32:12.750
HOLMES: The first man,
a member of Champerico’s

32:12.750 --> 32:16.630
upper management in Guatemala,
arrives with this briefcase,

32:16.630 --> 32:18.000
but when the meeting concludes,

32:18.000 --> 32:20.210
the briefcase leaves
with this man.

32:20.210 --> 32:22.540
And you think I am that man?

32:22.540 --> 32:24.460
BELL: We looked
at your social media.

32:24.460 --> 32:27.540
We know you and your wife took
a trip to Guatemala last year,

32:27.540 --> 32:29.750
and the dates
coincide with the day

32:29.750 --> 32:30.920
these picture were taken.

32:30.920 --> 32:32.540
WATSON: But that’s not
the only interesting

32:32.540 --> 32:34.590
thing about the timing.
The New York City Council

32:34.590 --> 32:36.630
was about to vote
on an alcohol tax

32:36.630 --> 32:39.540
that was gonna hurt
Champerico’s business.

32:39.540 --> 32:42.300
You were one of the most
outspoken opponents of the tax,

32:42.300 --> 32:43.920
weren’t you, Councilman?

32:43.920 --> 32:46.210
This is crazy.

32:46.590 --> 32:49.090
Did I go to Guatemala? Yes.

32:49.090 --> 32:51.090
But are you really under
the impression that I was

32:51.090 --> 32:53.590
the only man with a bald spot
in the entire country?

32:53.590 --> 32:56.130
Hair loss patterns
are hardly fingerprints,

32:56.130 --> 32:57.210
but they are very distinctive.

32:57.210 --> 33:01.090
And yours is a match
for the one in that photograph.

33:01.090 --> 33:02.920
WATSON:
Your friend,

33:02.920 --> 33:05.250
Gabriel Rojas,
recognized it, too.

33:05.250 --> 33:06.630
He saw what we saw:

33:06.630 --> 33:07.540
you taking a bribe.

33:07.540 --> 33:08.670
He blamed Champerico
for the death

33:08.670 --> 33:10.630
of his nephew,
and he confronted you.

33:10.630 --> 33:12.170
BELL:
When you couldn’t
convince him

33:12.170 --> 33:15.540
that the man in these pictures
wasn’t you, you killed him.

33:15.540 --> 33:17.540
You hit him in the head
with something heavy.

33:17.540 --> 33:19.540
We’re not sure
where you decapitated him,

33:19.540 --> 33:22.170
but you took his body
to a place you knew:

33:22.170 --> 33:23.540
a community garden

33:23.540 --> 33:25.250
in the heart
of your district.

33:25.250 --> 33:26.540
Chicken head
and a few candles later,

33:26.540 --> 33:28.540
and you had a scene
that fit the story

33:28.540 --> 33:30.130
that you planned
to tell the next day:

33:30.130 --> 33:32.250
Gabriel was done in
by an occult killer,

33:32.250 --> 33:35.500
not a crooked politician.

33:36.090 --> 33:37.800
(chuckles)

33:38.540 --> 33:40.090
Okay.

33:40.090 --> 33:43.210
Let’s pretend for a second
that that is me.

33:43.210 --> 33:45.380
You have no proof that there’s
any money in that briefcase.

33:45.380 --> 33:48.540
If I didn’t take a bribe, I have
no motive to kill Gabriel.

33:48.540 --> 33:50.750
WATSON:
You’re right,
we can’t prove

33:50.750 --> 33:52.960
that there was money
in that briefcase.

33:52.960 --> 33:55.630
But luckily, we don’t have to.

33:55.630 --> 33:59.630
So, the dead chicken scratched
its killer before it died.

33:59.630 --> 34:01.090
His blood
was on her talons.

34:01.090 --> 34:03.500
We’re certain that when
we test it against yours,

34:03.500 --> 34:05.540
it’ll be a match.

34:05.550 --> 34:07.380
BELL:
You might not find
these pictures

34:07.380 --> 34:10.800
very compelling,
but a judge sure did.

34:10.800 --> 34:13.540
This is a warrant
to compel

34:13.540 --> 34:16.250
a DNA sample from you.

34:20.540 --> 34:23.500
(knock at door)

34:23.960 --> 34:25.170
Wanted to see me?

34:25.170 --> 34:26.840
Yeah. Close the door,
would you?

34:26.840 --> 34:31.050
I want to talk to you
about Lena Romero.

34:31.540 --> 34:33.840
I’m not gonna be
bringing her here

34:33.840 --> 34:35.670
when Marcus leaves.

34:35.670 --> 34:38.540
Your meeting went poorly?

34:38.540 --> 34:39.540
No. She did great.

34:39.540 --> 34:41.670
She’s smart, capable,
resourceful.

34:41.670 --> 34:44.090
She’s the real deal.

34:44.090 --> 34:45.090
So I don’t understand.

34:45.090 --> 34:48.540
Her old C.O.
called her "creative."

34:49.540 --> 34:51.540
You know what that’s code for.

34:51.540 --> 34:52.380
You’ve heard it enough.

34:52.380 --> 34:54.090
It’s the word
that cops tend to use

34:54.090 --> 34:55.800
when they talk
about you and Joan.

34:55.800 --> 34:58.540
You two want to search
someplace without a warrant,

34:58.540 --> 34:59.340
you do it.

34:59.340 --> 35:00.750
And then, if you need to,

35:00.750 --> 35:05.540
you claim that you heard someone
yelling for help from inside.

35:05.540 --> 35:07.540
You want the cops
to look at someone,

35:07.540 --> 35:09.340
but you don’t have cause?

35:09.340 --> 35:11.540
You call in an anonymous tip.

35:11.540 --> 35:12.500
You’re angry.

35:12.500 --> 35:14.500
You did a lot
of research about Romero.

35:14.500 --> 35:17.800
You honestly gonna tell me
you didn’t know this about her?

35:17.800 --> 35:20.170
I didn’t view it as a negative.

35:20.170 --> 35:22.540
Of course you didn’t.

35:22.540 --> 35:24.300
She’s a kindred spirit.

35:24.300 --> 35:28.340
Which is exactly what you
and Joan don’t need.

35:28.340 --> 35:29.500
You think it was an accident,

35:29.500 --> 35:31.540
me hooking you up with Marcus
six years ago?

35:31.540 --> 35:33.840
I knew you
just like I knew him.

35:33.840 --> 35:35.000
He knew where the lines were.

35:35.000 --> 35:38.380
He wasn’t gonna let you
hurt yourself or me.

35:38.380 --> 35:40.340
Oh, he was my babysitter.

35:40.340 --> 35:41.540
Yeah, he was.

35:41.540 --> 35:45.090
But luckily for both of us,
it turned into something

35:45.090 --> 35:47.630
more than that,
something special.

35:47.630 --> 35:48.540
Lightning struck.

35:48.540 --> 35:51.420
Now the question is--
can it strike again?

35:51.420 --> 35:54.920
’Cause if it can’t,
I don’t know how much longer

35:54.920 --> 35:57.210
you, me and Joan have together.

35:57.210 --> 35:59.420
I love what you did
for him.

35:59.420 --> 36:01.460
Getting him a shot
with the Marshals.

36:01.460 --> 36:02.380
He deserves it.

36:02.380 --> 36:06.540
But replacing him,
it isn’t gonna be easy.

36:08.000 --> 36:11.540
We’re gonna have to try
harder than this.

36:11.540 --> 36:14.130
For both of our sakes.

36:18.540 --> 36:20.540
WATSON:
No, we don’t want to be

36:20.540 --> 36:21.540
taken off the registry.

36:21.540 --> 36:24.960
We just don’t want
our home address listed.

36:25.540 --> 36:27.670
It’s gonna take a week? Why?

36:27.670 --> 36:28.750
(doorbell rings)

36:28.750 --> 36:31.840
Okay, you know what?
I-I’ll... I’ll call.

36:31.840 --> 36:34.960
I’ll call back. Thanks.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.090
Hi.

36:42.090 --> 36:43.250
I wanted to give you this.

36:43.250 --> 36:46.050
It’s money for the
window I broke.

36:46.050 --> 36:47.250
If it isn’t enough, let me know.

36:47.250 --> 36:49.170
I’ll pay you
when I have the difference.

36:49.170 --> 36:50.630
Honestly...
I insist.

36:50.630 --> 36:53.380
After all you did for Gabriel...

36:53.380 --> 36:55.540
it’s the least I can do.

36:56.090 --> 36:57.130
I’m glad that you came.

36:57.130 --> 36:59.960
I was gonna actually come
and see you tomorrow.

36:59.960 --> 37:01.800
Please.

37:05.540 --> 37:09.210
So, I’ve been doing, uh,
a lot of research lately

37:09.210 --> 37:10.550
on good products
for newborns.

37:10.550 --> 37:12.420
So I went out today
and picked up

37:12.420 --> 37:15.420
a few items
that I think you’ll need.

37:15.420 --> 37:16.340
(chuckles)

37:16.340 --> 37:18.750
No, I... I can’t.

37:18.750 --> 37:22.540
Please. Now it’s
my turn to insist.

37:29.460 --> 37:33.090
BELL:
Hope that’s not evidence
you’re destroying.

37:33.090 --> 37:35.800
Well, in a manner
of speaking, it is.

37:35.800 --> 37:38.250
Evidence of a bad idea.

37:38.630 --> 37:42.960
Couldn’t help but notice you and
the captain talking earlier.

37:42.960 --> 37:44.750
Everything okay?

37:44.750 --> 37:46.210
Yeah.

37:46.210 --> 37:47.750
You sure?

37:47.750 --> 37:48.590
Quite.

37:48.590 --> 37:51.170
Well, listen.
Chantal’s working late.

37:51.170 --> 37:53.300
I was gonna grab a
bite at Carnahan’s.

37:53.300 --> 37:56.540
Any interest?
Home of the Shamrock Poppers.

37:56.540 --> 37:58.840
Yeah, deep-fried
jalapeños and cheese

37:58.840 --> 38:00.880
rolled in green bread crumbs.

38:00.880 --> 38:01.670
You a fan?

38:01.670 --> 38:04.630
I’d sooner eat a pig carcass
rotting in a shallow pond.

38:04.630 --> 38:08.210
And I could, ’cause I’ve got
access to several.

38:08.550 --> 38:10.300
(chuckling):
Well, come on.

38:10.300 --> 38:12.550
First round of Poppers is on me.

38:12.550 --> 38:13.880
(sighs)

38:13.880 --> 38:16.540
I’m gonna miss you.

38:16.960 --> 38:20.420
Uh, we should hurry up
if, uh, you want to get a table.

38:20.420 --> 38:22.540
Not according to my watch.

38:22.540 --> 38:23.920
You and me?

38:23.920 --> 38:26.540
Still got plenty of time.

38:33.050 --> 38:34.500
You’re not
wearing a watch.

38:34.500 --> 38:38.210
(chuckles) Man, you really
are a master of observation.
