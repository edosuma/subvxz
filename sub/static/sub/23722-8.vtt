12:57.793 --> 12:59.659

13:02.531 --> 13:04.765

13:04.800 --> 13:07.367

what some call "porous mind."

13:18.380 --> 13:21.448

28:53.353 --> 28:55.319
Safety has always been an illusion.

All right. My parents grew
up during World War II.

80 million people died.

29:03.028 --> 29:06.329
Two million died in Vietnam, and
your mom and I lived through that.

world was exploding.

29:09.034 --> 29:10.467

now that it's ever been.
