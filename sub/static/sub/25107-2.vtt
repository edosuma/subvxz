00:11.594 --> 00:13.930
<i>Michael had decided</i>
<i>to leave town,</i>

00:14.014 --> 00:16.975
<i>and needed to get out of
his obligation to make a movie</i>

00:17.058 --> 00:19.436
<i>- about his family.</i>
- Michael! You had one job.

00:19.519 --> 00:22.355
You had to get your son
to sign the releases!

00:22.439 --> 00:25.108
Ron Howard wants to make
a heartfelt father-son drama

00:25.191 --> 00:28.194
that has a good clean message
for his illegitimate daughter to star in.

00:28.278 --> 00:29.988
Don't pull this on me!
We've already reserved

00:30.071 --> 00:32.198
the soundstages
and he's already started paying off

00:32.281 --> 00:34.409
- the Hollywood Foreign Press.
<i>- No, they're great.</i>

00:34.492 --> 00:36.161
<i>- She's funny.</i>
- I understand all of that.

00:36.244 --> 00:39.247
Okay, but Rebel is part of
the reason why I can't do this.

00:39.330 --> 00:41.332
My son is dating her,
and I don't want to get

00:41.416 --> 00:42.917
in the way. If I could talk to Ron,

00:43.001 --> 00:44.794
- No. No. I am in charge
- I'm sure he and I...

00:44.878 --> 00:46.838
of this movie right now.
My ass is on the line

00:46.921 --> 00:49.174
while Ron makes a real movie in Mexico.

00:49.257 --> 00:51.134
- Mexico, okay.
- You don't understand

00:51.217 --> 00:52.844
how hard it is in Hollywood right now.

00:52.927 --> 00:54.429
You have to crank out family dramas

00:54.512 --> 00:57.098
before they let you make
your dream superhero movie.

00:57.182 --> 00:59.100
Do you have a dream superhero movie?

00:59.184 --> 01:01.519
I want to remake <i>Spider-Man 2,</i>
the first one.

01:02.103 --> 01:04.063
Or something that at least has a hook.

01:04.647 --> 01:07.817
- ...little girl!
- Oh, God! Damn it.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.028
My brother Buster has something
better than a hook.

01:10.904 --> 01:13.782
A robot hand. Okay?
And there's a cop looking for him.

01:13.865 --> 01:15.992
- Hmm.
- And they can't find Lucille 2.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.161
And I found Buster in the attic
in scuba gear.

01:18.244 --> 01:20.121
It's intriguing.
I think that's your movie.

01:20.205 --> 01:21.664
- That's your guy.
- No.

01:21.748 --> 01:23.625
Okay, I've got his release right here.

01:23.708 --> 01:26.086
<i>In fact,</i>
<i>it was the only family member's release...</i>

01:26.544 --> 01:28.546
You're out of the movie.
You're out of the movie.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.340
<i>- ...he hadn't destroyed.</i>
- You're out of the movie.

01:30.423 --> 01:32.217
You're out of the movie!
Know what?

01:32.300 --> 01:33.676
- You're out of the movie.
- Fine.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.095
Hey, Dad, how ya doing?

01:35.637 --> 01:38.056
- You're out of the movie!
<i>- With Buster,</i>

01:38.139 --> 01:40.767
it is not father-son,
it's more mother-son.

01:40.850 --> 01:43.728
But if you could get Rebel
to play Lucille, you know...

01:43.812 --> 01:45.230
If she could go that unlikable.

01:45.313 --> 01:46.815
So that's his release right here.

01:47.357 --> 01:49.400
These are the other releases.
You need tape,

01:49.484 --> 01:51.027
but they're pretty clean.

01:51.111 --> 01:54.405
You're off the picture, Michael.
I'll give you your 500 bucks.

01:55.281 --> 01:57.325
- I get paid?
- They're Imagine dollars.

01:57.408 --> 01:58.993
They're redeemable in the gift shop.

01:59.077 --> 02:01.246
- That's Ron Howard.
- Brian's on the 50.

02:01.329 --> 02:04.207
It's a severance thing they're doing
because of Ron's need to be loved

02:04.290 --> 02:05.917
and Brian's conflict avoidance issues.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.252
<i>Michael had gotten into something</i>
<i>he wanted no part of.</i>

02:09.336 --> 02:11.131
I'm sure they've got
a very old relationship.

02:11.214 --> 02:12.632
I could tell you stories.

02:12.715 --> 02:15.718
<i>But she wouldn't dare.</i>
<i>And after a quick stop downstairs...</i>

02:15.802 --> 02:17.303
I think I'm gonna take

02:17.387 --> 02:19.180
one <i>Gung Ho </i> kimono, okay?

02:19.264 --> 02:21.558
Oh, and maybe a Brian wig. That's fun.

02:21.641 --> 02:23.893
Oh, we only sell these as a set.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.395
They were getting very competitive.

02:25.478 --> 02:27.063
- Were they?
- Brian was.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.481
<i>...and another call to his son...</i>

02:28.565 --> 02:30.358
<i>You've reached George Maharis.</i>

02:30.441 --> 02:32.735
Did you want that Rebel Alley hair?

02:32.819 --> 02:34.070
Oh. Uh, no no.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.738
That's... that is mine.

02:35.822 --> 02:37.991
- I came with that. Uh, okay.
<i>- ...Michael headed home</i>

02:38.074 --> 02:41.703
<i>to tell Buster his plan
for making the family come back.</i>

02:41.786 --> 02:44.581
I've sent away the fumigator,
and all you got to do,

02:44.664 --> 02:46.416
so we can declare you missing,

02:46.499 --> 02:48.459
is stay out of sight for about 72 hours.

02:48.543 --> 02:50.086
- Milford style.
- Hmm?

02:50.170 --> 02:52.005
- I'm a Milford man, Michael.
- Yeah?

02:52.088 --> 02:54.799
Winner of 1982's Least Seen on Campus.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.678
I wish I could've seen their faces

02:58.761 --> 02:59.971
- at the ceremony.
- We just,

03:00.054 --> 03:02.348
you know, we gotta play this right
and, uh,

03:02.432 --> 03:03.975
you gotta make sure you don't...

03:04.893 --> 03:07.896
- well, show your hand.
- This is one of only two things

03:07.979 --> 03:10.481
the Army warns us about
when they issue these.

03:10.940 --> 03:13.067
Boy, Kitty does not know
what she's sitting on.

03:13.151 --> 03:16.237
Pal, I'm gonna call you from,
uh, wherever I end up,

03:16.321 --> 03:18.406
and you're gonna be great.

03:18.489 --> 03:21.492
I-I just don't understand why
I can't go with you, Michael.

03:21.576 --> 03:23.328
It's about teaching them a lesson.

03:23.411 --> 03:24.746
- Mm-hmm.
- So... And I just,

03:24.829 --> 03:26.789
I got in a big fight with my son,
you know.

03:26.873 --> 03:28.458
It was my fault. For so many years,

03:28.541 --> 03:29.918
I was his mom and dad, so...

03:30.793 --> 03:33.254
Maybe that's a role
I can play in your life.

03:33.338 --> 03:34.339
Don't say...

03:34.422 --> 03:36.174
Mom. Mmm.

03:38.009 --> 03:39.552
I thought you were gonna say Dad.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.012
- Mm-mm.
- But, you know,

03:41.095 --> 03:43.389
it's a bummer
that you can't come with me, Buster,

03:43.473 --> 03:45.141
but you need to stay and talk to the cops.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.351
Cops? What cops?

03:46.976 --> 03:50.021
- Why would you bring the cops into this?
- They're already looking for you.

03:50.104 --> 03:52.273
What? The cops are looking for me?

03:52.357 --> 03:54.525
<i>- A </i> cop, actually.
- I can't be talking to the cops.

03:54.609 --> 03:56.694
- Listen.
- I don't do good with the cops.

03:56.778 --> 03:58.238
I didn't do anything.
I don't know what's going on.

03:58.321 --> 04:00.573
- Relax.
- I ain't got no truck with no blue.

04:00.657 --> 04:01.783
Nothing to worry about.

04:01.866 --> 04:04.077
They're looking for Lucille Austero.
They want to question you.

04:04.160 --> 04:07.872
Why would I know anything about Lucille 2?
I hope you didn't say we were dating.

04:07.956 --> 04:11.084
Uh, well, I mean, you...
you did live with her.

04:11.167 --> 04:14.587
Well, I lived with Mother.
Did you think we were dating?

04:15.421 --> 04:17.632
Question's been asked.

04:17.714 --> 04:19.968
- Do you actually know where Lucille 2 is?
- No!

04:20.051 --> 04:22.428
No! A thousand times, no!

04:23.012 --> 04:24.013
Is that what they'll ask?

04:24.097 --> 04:26.015
'Cause it's not like I'm gonna
remember details

04:26.099 --> 04:27.934
about where I saw her
and what we fought about.

04:28.017 --> 04:29.102
Oh, you fought?

04:29.185 --> 04:31.396
You kept me from Mother?

04:31.479 --> 04:33.690
You sent her to prison?

04:36.317 --> 04:37.777
Should I not say that?

04:38.361 --> 04:40.989
- I'm not good with the cops.
- Right.

04:41.072 --> 04:43.866
What if Lucille 2 doesn't come back?

04:43.950 --> 04:47.287
Don't worry about that.
She... I just spoke to her today.

04:47.370 --> 04:50.039
- What? In person?
- Yeah. Uh, no.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.165
On the phone. She's fine.

04:51.249 --> 04:53.418
Well, you could've told me that
from the beginning.

04:53.501 --> 04:55.795
This is not about Lucille 2.
This is about teaching Mom

04:55.878 --> 04:57.005
- a lesson, you know.
- Oh.

04:57.088 --> 04:58.589
I mean, she just splits town

04:58.673 --> 05:00.925
and assumes
I'm gonna take care of everything?

05:01.009 --> 05:02.719
You know, this is just a way to, uh...

05:02.802 --> 05:04.721
- Give Mom a little scare.
- Yeah.

05:04.804 --> 05:08.308
Yeah. Let them race back into town
and save everyone for a change.

05:08.391 --> 05:09.684
There's nothing to worry about.

05:09.767 --> 05:12.645
Just Mama's worst nightmare.
Buster's missing.

05:12.729 --> 05:15.523
Oh, and his bath has gone cold.

05:15.606 --> 05:17.483
<i>Buster was on board.</i>

05:17.567 --> 05:20.194
Maybe have a full psych panel
while you're in there, too.

05:20.278 --> 05:22.113
Oh, those things are so easy to beat.

05:23.823 --> 05:26.326
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything,</i>

05:26.409 --> 05:28.870
<i>and the one son who had no choice</i>

05:28.953 --> 05:30.496
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

05:36.461 --> 05:38.171
<i>It's...</i>

05:42.258 --> 05:44.302
<i>Having traveled south of the border,</i>

05:44.677 --> 05:47.221
<i>George Sr.
and his son G.O.B. found themselves</i>

05:47.305 --> 05:48.681
<i>at a Mexican singles bar.</i>

05:48.765 --> 05:50.933
- It's dead.
- Yeah. Second place in a row.

05:51.017 --> 05:54.312
<i>Each looking for an excuse</i>
<i>for their lack of heterosexual vigor.</i>

05:54.395 --> 05:56.439
Where are all the blondes? It's just...

05:56.522 --> 05:59.067
<i>But it wasn't a blonde</i>
<i>G.O.B. was thinking about.</i>

05:59.150 --> 06:01.986
<i>His recent rivalry
with magician Tony Wonder</i>

06:02.070 --> 06:05.281
<i>had blossomed into a kind of friendship...</i>

06:06.199 --> 06:09.118
<i>before contracting into a rivalry again.</i>

06:09.452 --> 06:10.787
Same.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.163
<i>Which suddenly became a...</i>

06:12.246 --> 06:15.458
<i>oh, let's say,
boarding school romance.</i>

06:15.541 --> 06:18.169
Uh, this place is full of...

06:18.252 --> 06:20.671
<i>Cincos </i> and <i>mayos.</i>

06:21.214 --> 06:23.674
We need to find out
whatever the word for ten is.

06:23.758 --> 06:25.551
- Find that.
- It's ten.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.637
- Every culture uses ten.
- Ten.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.722
<i>It wouldn't matter if it was an 11,</i>

06:29.806 --> 06:32.517
<i>because George Sr., too,
had changed recently...</i>

06:32.600 --> 06:34.644
It blew off at the CVS parking lot.

06:34.727 --> 06:37.230
<i>...having lost all sexual feeling of late</i>

06:37.313 --> 06:41.234
<i>- despite some very progressive therapy.</i>
- Hopi Indians believe that this spot...

06:41.317 --> 06:42.527
- Okay.
- ...when manipulated,

06:42.610 --> 06:44.278
can create sexual feeling.

06:44.362 --> 06:46.239
- That's my penis.
- You don't have to tell me.

06:46.322 --> 06:47.907
<i>Which sent him into his crisis...</i>

06:47.990 --> 06:49.951
I can get hard,
so let's focus on you.

06:50.034 --> 06:51.285
<i>...of masculinity.</i>

06:51.369 --> 06:53.704
Hey, these are from the ladies
across the bar.

06:53.788 --> 06:55.957
- They're <i>primas.</i>
<i>- Primos, </i> huh?

06:57.333 --> 06:59.252
I've gotta be honest, I've seen better.

06:59.335 --> 07:00.962
Huh? Eh.

07:01.045 --> 07:02.213
No, it means cousins.

07:02.713 --> 07:05.383
One hates her father,
and the other hates her grandfather.

07:06.134 --> 07:08.261
<i>It seemed the cervezas</i>

07:08.344 --> 07:11.222
<i>weren't the only thing being handed
to the guys on a platter.</i>

07:12.723 --> 07:15.268
I don't know about you,
but I'd prefer the thrill of the hunt,

07:15.351 --> 07:16.978
- as opposed to...
- If we wait,

07:17.061 --> 07:19.647
something a little better will come along.

07:19.730 --> 07:20.898
Thank you.

07:20.982 --> 07:22.859
Not trying to fall
head over heels here.

07:22.942 --> 07:24.360
Yeah. Yeah.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.404
Not super eager to be, uh,
missing somebody.

07:26.487 --> 07:29.615
- Yeah.
- I mean, who you love.

07:33.453 --> 07:36.372
- Place gives me the creeps. Let's get out.
- Yeah. It's dead.

07:36.456 --> 07:39.125
<i>But back in America,</i>
<i>Michael was working on a way</i>

07:39.208 --> 07:41.210
<i>to make his runaway family return.</i>

07:42.003 --> 07:45.173
So, we gotta wait about 48 hours
before we declare you missing,

07:45.256 --> 07:47.008
- and then they put out an APB.
- APB.

07:47.091 --> 07:48.509
"Aw, poor Buster."

07:48.593 --> 07:49.635
- That's nice.
- Well...

07:49.719 --> 07:52.346
You gotta lay low long enough
for Mom and Dad to hear about it.

07:52.430 --> 07:54.724
And, pal, I would take you with me,
but truth is, I just,

07:54.807 --> 07:56.642
I don't know if I'm gonna come back.

08:02.231 --> 08:04.650
Oh.

08:05.151 --> 08:06.110
What's so funny?

08:06.861 --> 08:10.656
You always come back to save the family.
We joke about that all the time.

08:11.365 --> 08:14.994
Well, I don't know what the joke is.
I've been trying to do the right thing.

08:15.077 --> 08:17.663
"Hi, I'm Michael,

08:17.747 --> 08:21.083
and I save everyone so I feel special,
even though you don't deserve it.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.627
I'm leaving. I won't be coming back."

08:22.710 --> 08:23.920
- Buster...
- "Oh!

08:24.003 --> 08:25.713
Look who's back.

08:25.796 --> 08:28.508
I thought we were supposed to go
with a."

08:28.591 --> 08:31.052
"Mmm, you would know, Mother.
You practically invented

08:31.135 --> 08:34.054
when you get sauced!"

08:34.138 --> 08:36.849
"How dare you point that limp

08:36.933 --> 08:39.101
Hook at me when I saved you from one!

08:39.183 --> 08:42.730
I can't believe I pushed you
out of my ,

08:42.813 --> 08:45.024
you useless freak!"

08:46.192 --> 08:48.319
Covered a lot of ground there.

08:48.402 --> 08:49.278
Yeah.

08:49.445 --> 08:51.405
Although I'm glad
I won't be leaving you alone.

08:52.323 --> 08:53.407
Oh, I'm going with you?

08:53.491 --> 08:55.535
No, I'm going to Mexico or something,

08:55.618 --> 08:57.537
and you gotta go to the police station.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.914
- Oh, right. Why do they arrest me?
- They don't.

08:59.997 --> 09:01.666
You go to the police station
'cause you say,

09:01.749 --> 09:03.501
"Heard you were looking for me.
Here I am."

09:03.584 --> 09:05.503
Oh, but you said a cop had questions
for me.

09:05.586 --> 09:06.671
Mm-hmm. About Lucille 2.

09:06.754 --> 09:08.714
And I'm not gonna answer
any questions, right?

09:08.798 --> 09:10.967
- No. Answer the questions.
- When Barry says it's okay.

09:11.050 --> 09:13.261
Barry's not there. No attorneys.
Just tell the truth.

09:13.344 --> 09:15.346
Okay, like, bad example,

09:15.429 --> 09:19.100
I saw Lucille 2's lifeless body
sprawled across the stair car?

09:24.397 --> 09:26.274
Perfect.
If that's what happened, tell them.

09:26.357 --> 09:28.025
Nothing to be nervous about, okay?

09:28.109 --> 09:29.860
Lucille 2 is probably gonna be back

09:29.944 --> 09:31.237
from whatever bender she's on.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.406
She's gonna be as dry as, uh...

09:33.489 --> 09:35.032
well, Lucille 1.

09:35.116 --> 09:36.617
I can hear Mother winking now.

09:36.701 --> 09:39.620
So, I got some groceries.
These are gonna have to last.

09:39.704 --> 09:41.998
You already got into the candy bears, huh?

09:42.081 --> 09:43.874
This is literally one of only

09:43.958 --> 09:46.711
two things the Army warns about
when they issue these.

09:46.794 --> 09:48.087
- Let me help.
- I think they spent

09:48.170 --> 09:50.590
$27 million on the wrong guy.

09:50.673 --> 09:52.717
Don't you say that about you. Well...

09:52.800 --> 09:55.428
Maybe you do say that.
Maybe that's important to say.

09:55.511 --> 09:58.139
<i>And certain</i>
<i>his mother would have to return</i>

09:58.222 --> 10:01.017
<i>to take responsibility
for this particular son,</i>

10:01.475 --> 10:04.061
<i>Michael went to say goodbye to his own.</i>

10:10.026 --> 10:11.527
Ooh.

10:12.028 --> 10:13.404
Hey, I am outside your door.

10:13.487 --> 10:15.489
I was this close to telling you.
You inside?

10:15.573 --> 10:17.908
<i>Hi, it's Lucille Austero.</i>

10:17.992 --> 10:19.410
- No!
<i>- I've been looking for you.</i>

10:20.036 --> 10:21.495
Note, I mean.

10:21.579 --> 10:23.414
I know, I'd left you a note,

10:23.497 --> 10:26.292
and, can you hear me?

10:26.375 --> 10:29.378
Hello? Hello? Here we go again.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.713
Getting disconnected.

10:30.796 --> 10:33.966
This is why you always... leave a note.

10:34.842 --> 10:36.260
Always leave a note.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.054
Where's that from?

10:38.554 --> 10:41.641
<i>Michael discovered</i>
<i>a note he'd already written.</i>

10:41.724 --> 10:43.517
"Are you avoiding me? Ha ha.

10:43.601 --> 10:45.478
Leaving town for a while. Love you.

10:45.561 --> 10:47.063
- Michael Bluth."
<i>- It worked well.</i>

10:52.652 --> 10:55.279
<i>But perhaps if Michael
had taken a few seconds</i>

10:55.363 --> 10:57.907
<i>to write an original note
before leaving town,</i>

10:58.824 --> 11:02.453
<i>he would've run into George Michael,
who was coming to see him...</i>

11:04.080 --> 11:06.999
<i>only to come across a cousin
he didn't recognize.</i>

11:07.083 --> 11:09.835
- Hey. Know if anyone's home?
- Uh, yeah, Buster's in there.

11:09.919 --> 11:12.588
But if you're looking for Michael,
you just missed him.

11:14.048 --> 11:16.175
Oh, so much for apologizing.

11:16.258 --> 11:18.094
I'm telling you, he's moved on.

11:18.177 --> 11:20.930
- Okay? You should, too.
- I just found out

11:21.013 --> 11:22.598
my dad went to Mexico without telling me.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.767
Welcome
to the shitty parents club.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.602
- No, no, we don't have kids.
- No.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.229
<i>Although there was a kid</i>

11:28.312 --> 11:30.398
<i>that Maeby was eager to get away from.</i>

11:30.481 --> 11:33.192
You know,
Mexico sounds far from Perfecto.

11:33.275 --> 11:35.778
So that's perfect.
What do you say? Screw it!

11:35.861 --> 11:37.405
No rules. Anything goes.

11:37.488 --> 11:40.950
<i>A rebounding George Michael</i>
<i>found the offer intriguing.</i>

11:41.033 --> 11:42.952
- Just the cousins.
- Mm-hmm.

11:43.035 --> 11:44.370
<i>Which turned out to be...</i>

11:44.453 --> 11:47.123
<i>- Primos! </i>
<i>- ...this crew.</i>

11:48.082 --> 11:50.251
- Why do you keep yelling that?
- Stop it.

11:51.711 --> 11:52.545
Ah.

11:55.256 --> 11:58.259
<i>Not far away,</i>
<i>Michael was also heading to Mexico.</i>

11:58.843 --> 12:01.595
<i>And after taking care
of one last bit of business...</i>

12:01.679 --> 12:03.848
<i>It's Buster Bluth, that's right.</i>

12:03.931 --> 12:06.642
<i>Uh, yeah, I'm completely sure
he's been gone 72 hours.</i>

12:06.726 --> 12:08.436
<i>As a matter of fact,
his bath has grown cold.</i>

12:08.519 --> 12:11.021
<i>So that's, uh, an alarm bell right there.</i>

12:11.105 --> 12:12.732
<i>...Michael was ready</i>
<i>to hit bottom</i>

12:12.815 --> 12:14.900
<i>- and go off the map.</i>
<i>- Thanks so much.</i>

12:14.984 --> 12:16.694
<i>But that's hard to do</i>

12:16.777 --> 12:19.113
<i>when you're driving a car
that makes maps.</i>

12:19.196 --> 12:20.656
No pictures, thank you!

12:20.740 --> 12:22.491
Put your phones down.
We take the pictures.

12:22.575 --> 12:25.286
<i>When the fleet</i>
<i>of recovery vans arrived</i>

12:25.369 --> 12:28.038
<i>from the search engine
Michael had been working for,</i>

12:28.622 --> 12:31.208
<i>he discovered that the car
that takes the pictures</i>

12:31.292 --> 12:33.461
<i>- was no longer under his control.</i>
- No! Window up.

12:33.544 --> 12:35.212
- Window...
- Hi, I'm Dave from Mapping.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.673
She's Lisa from Traditional Search.

12:38.132 --> 12:40.551
- And that's Jeff.
- I'm Jeff from Earth.

12:41.093 --> 12:43.429
- Hi. Hi, guys.
- We heard we had a runaway ostrich,

12:43.512 --> 12:45.556
and, uh, we need you to return the car.

12:46.015 --> 12:48.517
Oh, yeah. Sorry. Am I under arrest?

12:48.601 --> 12:50.853
Oh, no. They never arrest the drivers.

12:50.936 --> 12:52.730
They do come down pretty hard
on the cars,

12:52.813 --> 12:55.065
but it's cheaper to just retrain
the people instead.

12:55.149 --> 12:58.110
It sounds super futuristic and dystopian,
but it's really not.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.362
<i>Earth was right.</i>

13:00.446 --> 13:01.989
<i>Because once he had been
escorted back</i>

13:02.072 --> 13:04.658
<i>to the impressive campus
of company headquarters,</i>

13:05.326 --> 13:07.995
<i>Michael found himself settling into a new</i>

13:08.078 --> 13:09.622
<i>and generally carefree life,</i>

13:10.748 --> 13:12.291
<i>one that couldn't have been farther</i>

13:12.374 --> 13:14.168
<i>from the bottom
he'd forgotten about hitting.</i>

13:14.251 --> 13:16.337
<i>Ironically, Michael's son</i>

13:16.420 --> 13:19.215
<i>had also experienced car troubles
in Mexico,</i>

13:19.423 --> 13:22.635
<i>and he wandered across
his grandfather's deserted land</i>

13:22.718 --> 13:24.220
<i>hoping to find a spare tire...</i>

13:24.303 --> 13:25.846
Can't believe
you didn't know who I was.

13:25.930 --> 13:28.974
<i>- ...and lose a third wheel.</i>
- Well, there's nothing we can say.

13:29.058 --> 13:31.685
I wouldn't blame you if you took off
and you don't come back.

13:32.102 --> 13:33.020
Nah.

13:33.562 --> 13:35.314
<i>Primos </i> stick together.

13:36.482 --> 13:38.442
Oh. "Cousin." It means "cousins."

13:38.526 --> 13:39.652
That makes sense.

13:40.694 --> 13:43.280
<i>But the land proved</i>
<i>not to be deserted, after all.</i>

13:48.369 --> 13:51.956
<i>And as the menacing horsemen</i>
<i>descended on the travelers,</i>

13:52.039 --> 13:53.499
<i>George Michael found himself tempted</i>

13:53.582 --> 13:55.417
<i>to bring up his dust allergies...</i>

13:55.501 --> 13:57.545
- We got a lot of dust.
<i>- ...but hinted at them instead.</i>

13:59.380 --> 14:00.589
<i>And they would soon discover...</i>

14:00.673 --> 14:03.509
You are not welcome here.

14:03.592 --> 14:06.053
Oh, so sorry, we j... Our car broke down.

14:06.136 --> 14:07.596
We thought we might
find somebody we know.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.348
My grandfather owns this land.

14:09.431 --> 14:11.725
That is not what the sign says.

14:12.893 --> 14:15.020
♪ <i>Mr. </i> Efe ♪

14:15.104 --> 14:18.148
I am the elder here. This is our land.

14:18.232 --> 14:21.652
And you would be wise to never
be seen here again. Strum!

14:25.447 --> 14:28.409
Now, if you'll excuse us,
we must say buenos días.

14:28.951 --> 14:31.036
<i>- Vamos, vamos.</i>
- Play the guitar, old man!

14:31.120 --> 14:33.455
Strum! Strum!

14:33.539 --> 14:36.667
<i>And George Michael asked</i>
<i>the question anyone might.</i>

14:36.750 --> 14:39.587
Who were those scary, handsome Mexicans

14:39.670 --> 14:40.963
on those magical horses?

14:41.714 --> 14:43.757
They just looked like old white men to me.

14:43.841 --> 14:44.884
Oh.

14:44.967 --> 14:46.635
We should probably get out of here.

14:46.719 --> 14:49.388
Yeah, I mean,
I've got a big job on Monday, anyway.

14:49.471 --> 14:52.766
I was gonna have to leave early,
and I didn't know how to tell you.

14:52.850 --> 14:55.269
But now we can just all go together.

14:55.352 --> 14:57.605
<i>And that's when he saw his opening.</i>

14:57.688 --> 14:58.522
Never.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.609
Never. Are you...?

15:01.692 --> 15:03.193
No. I mean, we're Bluths.

15:03.277 --> 15:04.862
We're gonna stay. Maeby, too. We're...

15:04.945 --> 15:06.322
The two of us are gonna stay.

15:06.405 --> 15:08.824
<i>And soon,</i>
<i>being with his cousin was no longer</i>

15:08.908 --> 15:10.910
<i>- an obstacle...</i>
- Crazy asshole.

15:10.993 --> 15:13.704
<i>...to George Michael's hope
of being with his cousin.</i>

15:13.787 --> 15:15.205
I was wondering how you were
gonna get rid of him.

15:15.289 --> 15:17.416
- Was I that obvious?
- I just know that you don't like

15:17.499 --> 15:19.585
standing up to people
on horses with guns.

15:19.668 --> 15:20.920
No, I never really was that guy.

15:21.295 --> 15:23.422
- Let's find a bar.
- Okay. Yeah, I'd love that.

15:23.505 --> 15:25.758
<i>And so, after getting out</i>
<i>of their dusty clothes,</i>

15:25.841 --> 15:27.009
<i>the two did just that.</i>

15:27.885 --> 15:28.802
<i>And George Michael</i>

15:28.886 --> 15:31.138
<i>was soon getting a real feel
for the people.</i>

15:31.221 --> 15:32.973
Hey. You're not gonna believe this.

15:33.057 --> 15:35.184
I met these guys that are actually
from Orange County.

15:35.267 --> 15:37.394
And two of them also go to UCI.

15:37.478 --> 15:40.356
Two of them are named Noah,
but not the two that you'd think.

15:40.439 --> 15:41.315
- Cool?
- Really cool.

15:41.398 --> 15:44.234
They're staying here, renting a place
while they do this language course.

15:44.318 --> 15:45.569
We could stay with them.

15:46.028 --> 15:47.571
I'm thinking about heading back.

15:47.655 --> 15:48.656
N... Wait, look.

15:48.739 --> 15:51.241
If this is about me firing you
from Fakeblock,

15:51.325 --> 15:52.701
there's something you should know.

15:53.285 --> 15:55.704
Fakeblock doesn't actually exist.

15:56.747 --> 15:59.416
Are you telling me that the software

15:59.500 --> 16:02.086
that's supposed to keep
people's computers unhackable

16:02.169 --> 16:06.590
and keep any kind of information private
doesn't exist?

16:08.050 --> 16:09.218
How did you find out?

16:09.301 --> 16:12.096
It was easy. I just looked in
your computer under "Secrets."

16:12.179 --> 16:14.181
Oh, you looked
in my "Please Don't Read" folder?

16:14.264 --> 16:17.142
No, that one was empty.
I found it in "Just Odds and Ends."

16:17.226 --> 16:18.811
Great, you got past my double bluff.

16:18.894 --> 16:21.605
It's okay, George Michael.
You worry too much.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.817
Yeah, that keeps me up at night, actually.

16:24.900 --> 16:28.112
I just feel like I gotta move on
with my life, you know?

16:28.195 --> 16:29.613
Find some meaning.

16:30.072 --> 16:31.865
Get going with my own goop.

16:31.949 --> 16:33.617
Goop? What is goop?

16:33.701 --> 16:36.120
If you have to ask,
you probably don't know what it is.

16:36.203 --> 16:37.663
I don't know what it is.

16:37.788 --> 16:39.623
I feel like maybe
you don't know what it is.

16:39.707 --> 16:41.083
Maybe it's "go-op"?

16:41.417 --> 16:43.210
To me, that would make less sense.

16:43.711 --> 16:45.504
Maybe that's what "go-op" is.

16:45.879 --> 16:48.382
Not everything always making sense.

16:49.341 --> 16:50.551
<i>It isn't.</i>

16:50.634 --> 16:53.762
<i>Meanwhile,
George Sr. and G.O.B. continued trying</i>

16:53.846 --> 16:55.264
<i>to out-goop each other.</i>

16:55.347 --> 16:58.017
I won't tell Mom
about all the ladies you're

16:58.100 --> 17:01.145
If you don't tell Mom
about all the ladies I'm.

17:01.603 --> 17:04.189
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Look at that one coming up.

17:04.271 --> 17:05.607
Where, where? Oh, my God.

17:05.691 --> 17:08.068
Oh, she's hot. She's so hot. Dibs!

17:08.152 --> 17:09.944
No, no, no, Daddy saw her first.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.781
- Daddy dibs.
- She got a friend or...?

17:12.865 --> 17:14.281
She's got a friend! That's a friend?

17:15.992 --> 17:18.243
<i>Bush. Trash bag and bush.</i>

17:18.871 --> 17:20.622
- Thought it was a woman.
- Yeah.

17:20.789 --> 17:22.082
- Like, hunched over, right?
- Yeah.

17:22.165 --> 17:24.960
Like, with the...
I wanted to do her so bad.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.880
Wow. I mean, I...
And I really liked her friend.

17:27.963 --> 17:30.090
Me, I liked her, too.

17:33.635 --> 17:36.221
- That was a ten-gallon Hefty sack?
- Oh, yeah.

17:36.305 --> 17:39.224
- Yeah, a ten. Definitely a ten.
- Yeah. Yeah. Nice.

17:40.142 --> 17:41.268
I like.

17:41.977 --> 17:44.605
I like... a ten.

17:45.981 --> 17:49.485
<i>And Lucille, at the behest of</i>
<i>her court-mandated therapist,</i>

17:49.568 --> 17:53.238
<i>- was struggling to make sense of things.</i>
- Am I horrible for saying these things?

17:53.322 --> 17:56.075
No. But I was doing the math,
and I still think

17:56.158 --> 17:59.078
you're gonna have a problem
with this final "raped murderer."

18:00.496 --> 18:01.872
But who cares about him?

18:02.331 --> 18:04.166
Oh, this is pointless.

18:04.249 --> 18:06.502
How many more sessions
do I have to endure

18:06.585 --> 18:07.711
until I'm done with...

18:08.253 --> 18:10.047
no offense... you?

18:10.172 --> 18:13.926
Legally, two. But I am in the family.

18:15.844 --> 18:19.014
I mean... this is my family.

18:20.182 --> 18:23.060
My daughter is divorcing you.
This is it.

18:23.143 --> 18:25.062
I'm confused by the word "it."

18:25.145 --> 18:28.524
Are you implying that you
don't want to see me anymore?

18:28.857 --> 18:31.443
I'm confused by the word "anymore."

18:32.486 --> 18:34.279
There are many things
I can do for this family.

18:34.363 --> 18:37.533
You've lost touch with your daughter.
Put me in, for God sakes.

18:37.616 --> 18:41.328
- I thought this was <i>my </i> time.
- It is your time. Yes, yes.

18:41.411 --> 18:43.413
But as your therapist,
I'm pointing out that I know

18:43.497 --> 18:45.624
that you build these walls
to keep out, for instance,

18:45.707 --> 18:47.626
your surviving children-in-law.

18:47.709 --> 18:50.003
Oh, don't talk to me about walls.

18:50.087 --> 18:52.047
That's why we're in this mess.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.341
My husband buys land
so we can get a contract

18:54.424 --> 18:56.385
to build a little something on the border.

18:56.468 --> 18:57.928
A-a wall.

18:58.011 --> 19:00.013
And we did everything right.

19:00.097 --> 19:01.473
<i>Well, not everything.</i>

19:02.850 --> 19:04.434
<i>They did buy land on the border...</i>

19:04.518 --> 19:06.812
- You live here?
<i>- ...to sell back to the government.</i>

19:06.895 --> 19:08.272
- The check.
<i>- And they paid off</i>

19:08.355 --> 19:10.357
<i>- a politician...</i>
- I am gonna put this on my <i>wall.</i>

19:10.440 --> 19:11.525
<i>...to stir up xenophobia.</i>

19:11.650 --> 19:15.112
We have got to build a wall
between us and Mexico.

19:15.195 --> 19:16.989
- Yeah, yeah.
<i>- Of course, they made</i>

19:17.072 --> 19:20.409
<i>- a few rookie mistakes.</i>
- I bribed Love to get the wall,

19:20.492 --> 19:22.953
and I don't have the land to build it on!

19:23.036 --> 19:24.037
<i>Well, they had it.</i>

19:24.121 --> 19:26.331
<i>It was just on the wrong side
of the border.</i>

19:26.874 --> 19:29.793
<i>Which they might have known
had George's brother Oscar</i>

19:29.877 --> 19:31.837
<i>- not burned the signs.</i>
- It's okay to burn these?

19:31.920 --> 19:34.256
Well, this is America.
They don't want us to burn signs,

19:34.339 --> 19:35.924
they shouldn't write 'em in Spanish.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.760
<i>And so, Lucille did</i>
<i>what her own government might do.</i>

19:38.844 --> 19:41.638
Who better than the Chinese
to help us build a wall, right?

19:41.722 --> 19:44.224
- <i>She borrowed from the Chinese.</i>
- That's good enough.

19:44.308 --> 19:46.101
<i>Of course, none of this</i>

19:46.185 --> 19:48.562
<i>- was okay with the woman...</i>
- How dare you?!

19:48.645 --> 19:50.314
<i>- ...who owned a majority stake...</i>
- Lucille...

19:50.397 --> 19:51.356
<i>- ...in the company.</i>
- ...Two

19:51.440 --> 19:53.942
I can't be running a company
that's building a wall

19:54.026 --> 19:55.235
I campaigned against!

19:55.319 --> 19:57.571
<i>And with their politician</i>
<i>out of the race,</i>

19:57.654 --> 19:59.281
<i>their future looked bleak.</i>

19:59.364 --> 20:02.159
So, unless some angel descends
on a golden chariot,

20:02.242 --> 20:04.703
we're completely over-leveraged.

20:04.786 --> 20:08.707
And maybe you don't want
to get hurt because,

20:08.790 --> 20:13.337
as I say, hurt people... hurt people.

20:13.795 --> 20:15.088
Oh, that's nice.

20:15.923 --> 20:19.301
I always say,
"Make people cry, make people cry."

20:19.384 --> 20:21.011
But yours includes the people

20:21.094 --> 20:23.388
who don't want to give you
the satisfaction.

20:23.472 --> 20:25.766
<i>Tobias decided to err on the side</i>

20:25.849 --> 20:28.352
<i>of Lucille keeping him on as a therapist.</i>

20:28.435 --> 20:30.312
You know what, let's lock that in there.

20:30.395 --> 20:32.898
And I'd say we've made
some real good progress today.

20:32.981 --> 20:35.817
Yes.
I really think this is working.

20:37.069 --> 20:37.945
Swimming!

20:38.028 --> 20:41.365
Hurt people, hurt people.

20:41.448 --> 20:43.742
<i>Lindsay had also made it to Mexico,</i>

20:44.284 --> 20:46.787
<i>and was enjoying the fact that
men were more respectful.</i>

20:46.870 --> 20:48.288
<i>Puta </i> Night is Thursday.

20:49.122 --> 20:53.001
- That's so nice. No, I'm not.
<i>- That was based on her belief</i>

20:53.085 --> 20:55.295
<i>- that </i>"puta" <i>meant "young."</i>
- No. <i>Puta.</i>

20:55.379 --> 20:57.339
I try to stay out of the sun.

20:58.507 --> 21:01.176
<i>And that's when she saw</i>
<i>what appeared to be</i>

21:01.260 --> 21:04.096
<i>- a Mexican version of her father.</i>
- Oh, my God.

21:04.179 --> 21:06.348
Lindsay. What are you doing here?

21:06.431 --> 21:08.141
Guess I just had to get away.

21:08.225 --> 21:10.060
I was just ordering lunch.
Can I buy you lunch?

21:10.143 --> 21:12.229
Oh, yeah. I'm so hungry, I could eat.

21:12.312 --> 21:13.814
<i>Lindsay's daughter, meanwhile,</i>

21:13.897 --> 21:15.899
<i>discovered that her trip back home...</i>

21:15.983 --> 21:18.193
- This is as far as we go.
<i>- ...took a detour.</i>

21:18.986 --> 21:19.987
Oh.

21:20.070 --> 21:22.364
- You live here?
- No.

21:22.447 --> 21:23.824
These people have nothing.

21:23.907 --> 21:25.993
We are lucky. We have next to nothing.

21:26.076 --> 21:28.537
We are helping these people
because nobody else will.

21:28.620 --> 21:31.540
They've been kicked out
of the only country they've ever known

21:31.623 --> 21:33.542
because of the cruelty
of your president...

21:33.667 --> 21:34.543
Barack Obama.

21:35.419 --> 21:37.087
Their old country is their mother,

21:37.337 --> 21:38.755
new country is their father.

21:38.839 --> 21:40.966
Imagine if your mother
and your father did not want you.

21:41.049 --> 21:43.760
So, you're trying to, like,
teach them a lesson or...?

21:43.844 --> 21:44.970
We're volunteers.

21:45.053 --> 21:46.638
Who did you think the water was for?

21:47.556 --> 21:50.559
Oh.
I thought you were just trying to get me

21:50.642 --> 21:52.602
to give you a higher Uber rating.

21:54.187 --> 21:56.982
<i>And Maeby decided to stay</i>
<i>and help.</i>

22:00.819 --> 22:03.572
<i>George Michael, meanwhile,
settled into a different kind</i>

22:03.655 --> 22:05.449
<i>of "south of the border" lifestyle.</i>

22:05.532 --> 22:06.700
Mexico.

22:07.326 --> 22:08.869
It's like being in the Spanish dorms

22:08.952 --> 22:11.913
of the UCI sister campus
in Spain all over again.

22:13.081 --> 22:15.959
<i>He was noticing subtle differences</i>
<i>in the cuisine.</i>

22:16.043 --> 22:17.586
God, the salt is different here.

22:17.669 --> 22:18.962
It's fatter or something, right?

22:19.046 --> 22:21.173
- We're from Orange County.
<i>- He reached out to locals.</i>

22:21.256 --> 22:24.009
Dude, I'm from San Diego.
They want everyone to think we're Mexican.

22:24.092 --> 22:26.511
- My name's Noah.
<i>- He met another Noah.</i>

22:26.595 --> 22:29.181
- Noah, get over here.
<i>- Noah met another Noah.</i>

22:29.264 --> 22:31.725
- What up, dawg?
<i>- And soon five,</i>

22:31.808 --> 22:34.019
<i>I want to say,
indistinguishable Americans</i>

22:34.102 --> 22:36.772
<i>- had Mexico on its heels.</i>
- You didn't know this was Noah?

22:37.272 --> 22:39.691
- <i>They saw foreign films.</i>
- I'm glad someone had the guts

22:39.775 --> 22:41.068
to give the Minions their own movie.

22:41.151 --> 22:43.570
It's great
because it's subtitled in Spanish,

22:43.653 --> 22:45.530
but we don't have to read.
It's in English.

22:45.614 --> 22:47.574
If you don't want to see 'em,
you can block 'em.

22:48.325 --> 22:49.659
<i>Started trends.</i>

22:53.622 --> 22:56.500
<i>They discovered
charming native communities...</i>

22:57.918 --> 23:00.504
<i>where local artisans
peddled their wares.</i>

23:02.881 --> 23:05.634
- Mexico.
<i>- Adopted customs</i>

23:05.717 --> 23:07.886
<i>like the midday break, or siesta.</i>

23:08.428 --> 23:11.098
Yes! Who left the air conditioning on?

23:11.181 --> 23:13.433
- Oh, me. I never left.
<i>- And while George Michael</i>

23:13.517 --> 23:15.811
<i>- was enjoying his status quo...</i>
<i>- Why'd we go out?</i>

23:15.894 --> 23:19.398
<i>...Lucille was on the verge
of an emotional breakthrough</i>

23:19.481 --> 23:21.274
<i>that could possibly change her life.</i>

23:21.358 --> 23:23.527
...and our whole life
is turned upside down.

23:23.610 --> 23:25.946
This is my time. Your session ended.

23:26.029 --> 23:28.156
<i>That's when she heard something...</i>

23:28.240 --> 23:29.908
<i>...that would definitely change her life.</i>

<i>...candidate descended</i>
<i>the escalator into the lobby.</i>

23:32.536 --> 23:36.873
<i>I will build a great, great wall
on our southern border.</i>

23:36.957 --> 23:38.917
Which was my idea!

23:39.584 --> 23:42.295
And I will have Mexico pay
for that wall.

23:42.379 --> 23:44.464
Okay.

23:45.048 --> 23:46.508
That is a clever twist.

23:50.011 --> 23:52.264
<i>Michael had been</i>
<i>at Search for a month.</i>

23:52.389 --> 23:55.225
<i>In that time,
he'd developed himself physically...</i>

23:55.308 --> 23:57.352
And then lunge.
Duck, sweep the leg, lunge.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.104
<i>...been given a new company car.</i>

23:59.187 --> 24:01.106
Ted, I think you see your daughter coming.

24:01.189 --> 24:03.775
You're not expecting this,
but she's coming in hot

24:03.859 --> 24:05.986
- with a right...
<i>- He'd gotten to teach a class</i>

24:06.069 --> 24:09.239
<i>he'd successfully persuaded management
to try out.</i>

24:09.322 --> 24:12.451
Mona, I know your husband's down,
he probably needs medical attention,

24:12.534 --> 24:14.494
but you got another son on your flank.

24:14.578 --> 24:17.080
And, everybody, we're going to duck,
sweep the leg, and lunge.

24:17.164 --> 24:20.375
And he comes back again.
And we sweep the leg and lunge.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.252
That's great.
Everybody put down your cactus.

24:22.335 --> 24:24.421
Let's all huddle up.
Okay, now that you're loose,

24:24.504 --> 24:26.089
we're gonna do some Mom Attacks Son,

24:26.173 --> 24:27.966
we're gonna do Dad Attacks Daughter,

24:28.049 --> 24:30.135
and then we're gonna do
Dad Attacks Mom...

24:30.218 --> 24:32.888
<i>But he still felt something</i>
<i>was missing from his life</i>

24:32.971 --> 24:36.224
<i>- when he found a way to satisfy a dream.</i>
- Wow, satisfy an old dream.

24:36.308 --> 24:39.561
Boy, do you really have to spend
1,000 bucks on the gear, though?

24:39.644 --> 24:41.646
- Not if you have your own.
- Mm.

24:41.730 --> 24:43.815
Yeah. Yeah, well, not here,

24:43.899 --> 24:46.234
but I could drive home and get it.

24:46.318 --> 24:47.861
Course, I could see my family.

24:47.944 --> 24:50.864
<i>A family Michael hadn't seen</i>
<i>in some time.</i>

24:50.947 --> 24:52.157

24:52.240 --> 24:55.535
Ah, what the heck.
For 1,000 bucks, it's worth the risk, huh?

24:58.580 --> 25:02.250
<i>Michael returned</i>
<i>to a model home he left in some disgrace.</i>

25:02.792 --> 25:05.587
