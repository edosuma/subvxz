00:01.929 --> 00:03.609
Previously on Angel:

00:04.330 --> 00:06.540
You're never going to be alone again.

00:07.929 --> 00:09.679
How'd you think it would end?

00:10.330 --> 00:11.730
For God's sake, help us.

00:12.130 --> 00:15.039
- People are going to die.
- I just don't care.

00:16.329 --> 00:19.879
There's only us three
between you and real darkness.

00:20.530 --> 00:21.690
You're all fired.

00:23.000 --> 00:29.074

00:30.850 --> 00:33.060
Who was that?

00:56.689 --> 00:58.939
They closed down
and left these here?

00:59.689 --> 01:02.880
Yep. Also the desk.
We'll share.

01:04.328 --> 01:06.890
And when we close down,
we'll leave it too.

01:07.329 --> 01:08.560
Hey, negative energy!

01:09.129 --> 01:12.010
With our money pooled,
we can stay a long time.

01:12.730 --> 01:14.409
- Twenty minutes.
- At least.

01:15.730 --> 01:19.590
Angel Investigations without the Angel.

01:21.129 --> 01:22.739
Think we can do it?

01:22.930 --> 01:25.530
Well, we better.
What else can we do?

01:25.930 --> 01:28.349
I still have visions to keep us busy.

01:28.930 --> 01:31.840
We'll need more.
A steady outside clientele.

01:32.530 --> 01:35.579
It'll happen. This is our future.
And personally...

01:36.129 --> 01:38.269
...I think it's pretty bright.

01:40.930 --> 01:44.159
Dead plant not symbolizing
our future, really.

01:45.129 --> 01:48.750
Okay, every local parked car has
a flyer on the windshield.

01:49.329 --> 01:52.170
We just irritated almost
a hundred people.

01:52.930 --> 01:56.159
- It's funky in here.
- It'll air out. And good job!

01:57.129 --> 01:59.590
Now we just wait
for the calls to roll in.

02:00.129 --> 02:02.549
Through a bullhorn?
We got no dial tone.

02:03.129 --> 02:04.180
What?

02:05.530 --> 02:07.209
Perhaps it's the wires.

02:07.329 --> 02:09.008
It should be on by now.

02:09.729 --> 02:11.550
One desk?
We sharing?

02:13.930 --> 02:17.650
Things are looking up.
I think I found the right wire. Ow!

02:19.330 --> 02:22.909
I'm so glad I met you guys.
It's entertaining, really.

03:06.250 --> 03:10.360
Oh, say does that
Star-spangled banner...

03:11.650 --> 03:13.090
...yet wave?

03:13.449 --> 03:15.800
For the land of the free

03:16.449 --> 03:18.340
And the home of the brave

03:18.849 --> 03:21.520
Hey! You must sing in here
all the time.

03:21.849 --> 03:23.710
Come on, with these acoustics?

03:24.250 --> 03:26.110
And the rockets' red glare

03:26.650 --> 03:29.560
- Hear the resonance?
- If I'm not dreaming, I hear...

03:30.250 --> 03:33.229
...is the national anthem from
a loud green demon.

03:33.849 --> 03:35.849
We're all brothers under the skin.

03:36.849 --> 03:41.240
Although the color and the horns have
kept me out of public performances.

03:41.650 --> 03:44.039
I'd love to sing at a Lakers game.

03:44.650 --> 03:46.900
- Is that too much?
- Why are you here?

03:47.650 --> 03:52.039
What's today, Thursday?
Tomorrow night the world's going to end.

03:53.050 --> 03:55.469
Thought you might want to know.

04:49.170 --> 04:50.680
The world's gonna end?

04:50.970 --> 04:52.620
Brings you down, right?

04:53.370 --> 04:56.560
Don't feel the need to offer me
coffee or a cinnamon roll.

04:56.970 --> 05:00.620
- I don't.
- Man, you just get darker and darker.

05:01.769 --> 05:04.050
The weird thing is your aura--
Beige.

05:04.170 --> 05:05.399
I don't have coffee.

05:05.970 --> 05:09.160
Or a duster. I don't know why
you fired those plucky kids.

05:09.569 --> 05:11.779
They were good company.
And Cordelia--

05:12.569 --> 05:16.540
Hot-o-rama!
In the "Oh, my sizzling loins" sense.

05:17.370 --> 05:21.339
And the British boy,
he's going to be playing a huge--

05:22.170 --> 05:24.379
Will you get to the world ending?

05:24.569 --> 05:28.470
All right. Although my good will
falling on your deaf ears...

05:29.370 --> 05:30.699
...needs some work.

05:31.170 --> 05:33.870
The world ending?
Kind of a funny story.

05:34.170 --> 05:36.980
At the club last night,
a typical Wednesday...

05:37.769 --> 05:41.319
...a Torto demon and his parasite
were murdering this song.

05:41.970 --> 05:43.930
Bye-bye, sweet caress

05:44.970 --> 05:46.829
Hello, emptiness

05:49.769 --> 05:51.839
Bye-bye, my love
Goodbye

05:52.769 --> 05:56.560
Nothing compared to what Elian
had done to my Seabreeze,

05:58.769 --> 06:00.699
Is this a difficult concept?

06:01.170 --> 06:04.220
Were we absent when they taught
Seabreeze in class?

06:04.769 --> 06:07.370
Vodka, cranberry,
fresh grapefruit juice.

06:08.370 --> 06:09.769
A real, live grapefruit.

06:10.170 --> 06:13.889
One you must cut and squeeze,
not pour from a can.

06:14.370 --> 06:18.060
The man is such a moron.
You have no idea how I'm suffering.

06:19.170 --> 06:21.519
Can you get to the point, already?

06:21.569 --> 06:25.220
If you let me get a word in,
Mr. Get-to-the-Pointy-Pants.

06:26.970 --> 06:29.000
This guy gets up to sing.

06:29.370 --> 06:32.810
They sing, I read their futures,
their auras.

06:33.569 --> 06:35.149
- I see into their souls--
- So this guy?

06:35.970 --> 06:40.319
The thing that was remarkable about
him was there was nothing remarkable,

06:40.769 --> 06:42.730
This is a song I like.

06:43.170 --> 06:47.310
- Because....
- Just a guy about to mangle a tune...

06:48.569 --> 06:51.899
...and bore me with a bland vision
of his bland future,

06:52.170 --> 06:54.379
I never needed anyone

06:57.569 --> 07:00.339
And making love was just for fun

07:12.569 --> 07:16.959
All by myself

07:17.970 --> 07:20.000
Don't wanna be

07:21.569 --> 07:24.550
But when he started singing--
Man, he knocked me out.

07:25.170 --> 07:26.329
He was good?

07:26.970 --> 07:28.930
No, he knocked me out!

07:32.970 --> 07:34.370
Then he was gone.

07:34.769 --> 07:37.439
- He didn't wait to hear what you saw?
- Nope.

07:39.569 --> 07:40.870
What knocked you out?

07:41.370 --> 07:45.410
I saw he has no future
after 10:00 tomorrow night.

07:46.170 --> 07:48.170
And neither does anybody else.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.639
- Say I believe you--
- Let's say more than that.

07:54.569 --> 07:57.480
We gotta find this guy.
This is the big blackout.

07:58.170 --> 08:00.199
He's going to do something...

08:00.569 --> 08:02.889
...that will cancel everybody's plans.

08:03.569 --> 08:04.939
We gotta stop him.

08:05.370 --> 08:08.350
- Why did you come to me?
- You're a champion.

08:08.970 --> 08:11.110
A force for good in a troubled world.

08:11.970 --> 08:15.550
Also, all the other champions
are out of town or dead.

08:16.170 --> 08:17.889
Why, you won't work with me?

08:18.569 --> 08:20.779
I gave you some missions that were--

08:20.970 --> 08:23.250
- Pointless and deadly?
- As for example....

08:23.970 --> 08:25.620
But I did it in good faith.

08:26.370 --> 08:29.560
And let me interrupt
to inform you: world ending!

08:29.970 --> 08:33.620
Kind of an emergency,
you might want to get on board.

08:35.370 --> 08:38.210
Why'd this guy leave
before you could tell him?

08:38.970 --> 08:42.450
People get scared.
They might not want to know.

08:43.169 --> 08:45.129
Especially when I faint...

08:45.570 --> 08:48.519
...a teeny bit of vomit.
Let's not dwell.

08:49.169 --> 08:51.909
Maybe he's just there to sing karaoke.

08:52.169 --> 08:55.889
That makes more sense.
We'll start with local karaoke bars...

08:56.970 --> 08:58.019
...to get a lead.

08:58.169 --> 09:02.240
If you're not busy getting lawyers
killed and setting girls on fire.

09:20.450 --> 09:22.480
Somebody forgot to wind Time Boy.

09:22.850 --> 09:25.690
He's thinking.
Something you ought to try.

09:26.450 --> 09:30.659
Very funny. He's really not
that much smarter than the rest of us.

09:31.250 --> 09:34.509
His work on time paradox earned
the professor a Nobel...

09:35.450 --> 09:38.399
...nomination while your work
on mold was forgotten.

09:39.049 --> 09:40.980
- Know what you are?
- Yes, Mike.

09:41.450 --> 09:44.710
If you say it, I'll put your face
in liquid nitrogen.

09:58.850 --> 10:00.639
What's the good word?

10:01.250 --> 10:03.389
- Entanglement.
- How's that?

10:04.250 --> 10:08.039
For Newton, space and time are
separate. For Einstein, entwined.

10:08.450 --> 10:10.549
"Einstein entwined," say it fast.

10:11.450 --> 10:15.659
How can altering one particle of an
entangled pair affect the other...

10:16.250 --> 10:20.009
- ...without any link between them?
- Because space and time are one.

10:20.450 --> 10:22.519
How do you separate the pair?

10:23.450 --> 10:25.700
You don't.
You probably shouldn't try.

10:25.850 --> 10:27.360
- I never do.
- What you do...

10:27.649 --> 10:32.220
...is carve out one instant at a time.

10:33.649 --> 10:36.559
I like the theory
of freezing time as much as--

10:36.649 --> 10:38.899
It's not freezing time.
I mean...

10:39.649 --> 10:44.149
...cutting an infinitesimal space-time
aggregate from all that surrounds it.

10:45.049 --> 10:46.659
A tiny event horizon.

10:46.850 --> 10:50.919
Sort of. Then growing that event
into something measurable.

10:51.649 --> 10:55.899
Your dog and his favorite bone,
preserved forever in his own bubble.

10:57.049 --> 10:59.190
And who will clean up that bubble?

10:59.450 --> 11:02.220
If I can get the math right,
I can prove it.

11:03.049 --> 11:07.299
By generating a focal point
with the accelerator's beams here...

11:07.850 --> 11:11.750
...and passing liquid mercury
through that point....

11:13.250 --> 11:17.750
Suspending the mercury, snatching it
out of our time-space continuum...

11:18.649 --> 11:20.330
...and freezing the moment.

11:21.049 --> 11:22.909
Forever.

11:23.450 --> 11:26.330
Denise. Your boyfriend
was hitting on me with...

11:27.049 --> 11:29.750
...the old Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen
correlation.

11:30.049 --> 11:33.139
That's what got me out of physics
and into theater.

11:34.250 --> 11:35.549
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi.

11:35.450 --> 11:37.240
- How are you?
- Good. You?

11:37.850 --> 11:40.240
Good. So what's new?

11:41.450 --> 11:44.500
- I guess we're on for tomorrow night.
- We are.

11:45.649 --> 11:49.789
- Big night.
- Yeah. One-year anniversary and all.

11:53.450 --> 11:54.850
Well, we should....

11:55.250 --> 11:56.970
- You guys are leaving?
- Yeah.

11:57.049 --> 11:59.049
I'll see you tomorrow night.

12:00.049 --> 12:02.750
- Don't work all night.
- You know he will.

12:12.649 --> 12:13.809
Nice.

12:14.450 --> 12:17.889
It's not that bad.
Nothing lots of Lysol can't cure.

12:18.049 --> 12:22.690
To cast me off discourteously

12:24.649 --> 12:28.759
An interesting choice.
Too bad about the Cuisinart tomorrow.

12:29.450 --> 12:32.929
If we stop the world ending,
the scar won't be noticeable.

12:33.649 --> 12:36.629
Sorry. Occupational hazard.

12:37.250 --> 12:38.690
Is he here?

12:38.649 --> 12:40.190
Nope.

12:41.049 --> 12:45.230
Seventeen karaoke bars. I need to
scrub out the inside of my head.

12:46.450 --> 12:49.610
Maybe we're wrong.
Sniffing a cold trail.

12:50.049 --> 12:51.559
Don't get your kind much.

12:51.850 --> 12:53.250
- Excuse me?
- Demons.

12:53.649 --> 12:56.740
Usually, we get vampires
passing for human.

12:57.850 --> 13:01.779
I never pass on anything with
a little umbrella in the glass.

13:02.649 --> 13:04.399
- Worked here long?
- Eleven years.

13:05.049 --> 13:07.370
Since they put
in that karaoke machine...

13:07.450 --> 13:09.769
...it drove most of the customers away.

13:10.450 --> 13:12.450
- We get a few steadies.
- Steadies?

13:13.450 --> 13:15.340
Lot of students.
Grad students.

13:15.850 --> 13:17.149
Fits the description.

13:17.049 --> 13:20.240
We're looking for a guy:
early 20s, medium build.

13:21.250 --> 13:23.990
- Sings sad songs.
- Sounds like The Kid.

13:24.250 --> 13:26.990
- Name?
- I don't know. He's here now and then.

13:27.850 --> 13:30.830
Always sings sad songs.
I thought somebody died.

13:31.450 --> 13:34.149
Later, I figured he
was a manic-depressant.

13:34.450 --> 13:37.929
You got a good picture of this
grad student in your head?

13:39.850 --> 13:42.870
How about singing
"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow"?

13:45.850 --> 13:48.590
He's a demon.
Do what he says, or he might...

13:48.850 --> 13:50.779
...talk your ears off.

13:53.649 --> 13:55.090
For he's a jolly good fellow

13:56.049 --> 13:57.980
For he's a jolly good fellow

13:58.450 --> 14:01.190
It's him. It's our boy.
Fabulous tone.

14:01.450 --> 14:04.820
Nice vibrato. And you keep writing
that novel, F. Scott.

14:05.649 --> 14:08.879
Art is its own reward.
Got to give the people hope.

14:09.250 --> 14:11.500
This student, which university is that?

14:25.450 --> 14:27.940
Momentum and mass energy...

14:30.850 --> 14:33.730
...within the conservation of PX...

14:33.850 --> 14:36.169
...PY and PZ.

14:41.649 --> 14:43.190
Here goes nothing.

15:08.049 --> 15:09.980
There went nothing.

15:11.649 --> 15:13.789
This is never gonna work.

16:01.730 --> 16:03.659
There, see?

16:04.129 --> 16:06.590
We don't need
the harsh fluorescents...

16:07.129 --> 16:10.429
- ...or useless computer information.
- Cordelia...

16:10.730 --> 16:12.269
...stop trying.

16:13.129 --> 16:15.899
- Really?
- Join us.

16:20.929 --> 16:22.649
Sometimes you need to wallow.

16:22.730 --> 16:26.700
Just let the depression
settle in silently.

16:28.769 --> 16:29.820
Hey.

16:30.570 --> 16:32.889
Wow, this place is great!

16:32.970 --> 16:36.059
I brought champagne.
You guys must be so excited.

16:38.370 --> 16:40.929
In that really dry, suicidal way.

16:41.370 --> 16:42.909
Sorry, sweetheart.

16:44.370 --> 16:46.830
You just caught us in a moment of....

16:47.370 --> 16:49.259
- Well--
- Reality.

16:49.769 --> 16:50.639
Oh, that.

16:50.970 --> 16:53.529
- I avoid that.
- How do you avoid reality?

16:53.970 --> 16:57.590
Money. It cures all but boredom,
and food cures boredom so...

16:58.169 --> 17:01.470
- ...here's imported chips and cheese.
- Thanks.

17:02.370 --> 17:05.420
We'll eat them huddled
around our pathetic candles.

17:07.170 --> 17:10.259
- And make pathetic nachos.
- You guys are really down.

17:10.769 --> 17:13.368
And don't tell us it can only go up.
Because...

17:13.769 --> 17:15.589
...there's always more down.

17:17.368 --> 17:19.118
That was very well said,
by the way...

17:19.769 --> 17:22.299
...but I found a client for you.
A rich one.

17:22.769 --> 17:25.470
- Really?
- Why didn't you say this first?

17:25.769 --> 17:28.190
I got distracted by your desperation.

17:28.769 --> 17:30.769
But my friend Patricia's family...

17:31.170 --> 17:34.859
...they've got this big guy
that's been harassing them at home.

17:35.970 --> 17:38.950
- They'd be grateful if you help them.
- Sounds easy.

17:39.569 --> 17:41.960
- Wait. By "big guy," you mean demon?
- Yes.

17:42.569 --> 17:44.319
They own a palatial estate...

17:44.369 --> 17:46.690
...and they'll give you big tubs of cash.

17:47.369 --> 17:50.880
Really rich family.
They invented chairs or something.

17:51.569 --> 17:52.690
We'll do it! Anything!

17:52.769 --> 17:55.160
That's so sad.
He's a Wainakay demon...

17:55.769 --> 17:58.299
...and he got the eldest son already.

17:59.369 --> 18:00.980
So there's been a death?

18:01.170 --> 18:03.420
You just let these facts dribble out?

18:04.170 --> 18:06.980
- I'll call Patty to say you'll help.
- No phone.

18:07.769 --> 18:10.089
- No lights.
- And there's a funky smell.

18:13.769 --> 18:15.730
I wasn't gonna say anything.

18:31.410 --> 18:33.299
Nine to the 17th?

18:33.809 --> 18:37.779
Where C-squared and E-squared are
obtained by differentiating...

18:38.609 --> 18:40.859
...the four velocity--

18:41.009 --> 18:43.960
Four velocity termination?

19:07.410 --> 19:09.440
I did it.

19:11.009 --> 19:13.220
This is a yee-ha moment.

19:13.410 --> 19:16.920
I definitely think this
is a yee-ha moment.

19:17.609 --> 19:19.680
Yee-ha!

19:35.609 --> 19:39.789
- Where did you learn how to drive?
- Just now, in your car. Not bad?

19:40.410 --> 19:42.619
- Nearly killed us four times.
- I drove...

19:43.410 --> 19:46.819
...because you were under the blanket,
hiding from the sun.

19:47.009 --> 19:50.380
I better hide and think of
something to say if I'm seen.

19:51.210 --> 19:54.930
Tell them you're the new
school mascot. Wait here.

20:32.009 --> 20:35.269
Yearbook and publications
going back five years.

20:35.609 --> 20:37.680
Let's find your little madman.

20:38.609 --> 20:42.789
I think of him as "our" little madman.
I'm a team player, you know?

20:50.009 --> 20:52.079
- You all right, girl?
- Huh?

20:53.009 --> 20:54.869
Yeah, fine.

20:55.410 --> 20:58.779
I'm good. You know, I'm not perfect.

20:59.609 --> 21:00.799
Oh, God.

21:00.809 --> 21:04.880
- Spit it out. You're among friends.
- This has to stay among friends.

21:06.210 --> 21:09.230
- You can't repeat this to anybody.
- I won't.

21:10.410 --> 21:13.849
I don't think it's gonna
work out with me and Gene.

21:14.609 --> 21:17.099
And tonight's your anniversary.

21:17.609 --> 21:20.029
- You think I don't know that?
- Oh, honey.

21:21.210 --> 21:23.769
- Gene's a wonderful guy.
- Yeah?

21:24.210 --> 21:26.140
But he's just sort of...

21:26.609 --> 21:28.609
...hollow, or something.

21:29.609 --> 21:31.609
When I'm with him, I feel....

21:32.609 --> 21:35.799
- I feel lonely.
- Maybe that's because he is.

21:36.210 --> 21:38.559
I love him, but he's an energy-sucker.

21:40.410 --> 21:42.509
I have to break up with him.

21:42.809 --> 21:46.809
Not to be a bitch, but couldn't
you have figured that out before?

21:47.609 --> 21:49.150
He has it all planned.

21:49.410 --> 21:52.890
- He's making me dinner.
- What are you gonna do?

21:56.009 --> 21:59.130
You're gonna give him
the sympathy bone, aren't you?

22:00.210 --> 22:04.140
It'll be dinner, sympathy bone,
and adiós Gene, right?

22:05.009 --> 22:08.630
We've been together for a year.
I can't walk out on him.

22:09.210 --> 22:12.400
It just wouldn't be right.
Not after all we've--

22:13.410 --> 22:17.170
The post-sympathy-bone walkout
is your only escape hatch.

22:18.809 --> 22:23.380
It was really sweet there for a while.
Really sweet.

22:24.210 --> 22:27.789
But it's just not the kind
of love that lasts.

22:39.930 --> 22:41.539
- This him?
- It is not.

22:45.930 --> 22:47.440
Got him.

22:48.329 --> 22:51.980
He's a physicist.
A pretty good one, according to this.

22:52.529 --> 22:54.740
I'll find out where the lab is.

22:56.130 --> 22:59.289
Hi. I'm just trying to get
ahold of Gene Rainy.

22:59.730 --> 23:03.170
- He's a physics grad student.
- Our own Stephen Hawking.

23:03.930 --> 23:06.559
- What do you want?
- Leonard Taubman.

23:07.529 --> 23:10.269
My foundation has
grant money for Gene.

23:10.529 --> 23:15.099
Wish I was a genius. He's got
his own lab in the physics department.

23:17.130 --> 23:18.670
It's not far from here.

23:19.529 --> 23:22.619
You stay on this path.
Go past Kelton Hall and--

23:23.130 --> 23:26.569
- What is that?
- Don't worry. School mascot.

23:53.730 --> 23:56.680
So I'll give her the kind
of love that lasts.

24:14.529 --> 24:15.650
Sorry.

24:34.329 --> 24:37.279
- What did you tell it?
- I said, "We come in peace."

24:37.930 --> 24:40.769
- What did he say?
- "You won't stop the one we've...

24:41.529 --> 24:42.579
...waited for."

24:42.730 --> 24:45.500
- Lubber demons are articulate.
- Lubber demon?

24:46.329 --> 24:50.089
Fanatical sect, awaiting a messiah
who will end all human life.

24:50.529 --> 24:52.809
Most demons don't yak about it, but...

24:53.529 --> 24:55.559
...it's a popular demon theology.

24:55.930 --> 25:00.500
This madman has demons protecting him
while he blows up the planet or--

25:01.930 --> 25:03.299
What's he gonna do?

25:03.130 --> 25:06.750
Let's go to his lab to find out.
He's a criminal mastermind.

25:07.930 --> 25:10.740
All by myself

25:13.329 --> 25:14.410
Anymore

25:16.329 --> 25:19.490
All by myself

25:21.730 --> 25:23.339
Don't wanna live

25:27.130 --> 25:29.660
All by myself

25:31.930 --> 25:33.369
We're looking for Gene.

25:33.730 --> 25:36.049
- Me too. Someone took his stuff.
- Stuff?

25:36.730 --> 25:38.690
Particle accelerators, propulsion--

25:39.130 --> 25:41.519
- What's that?
- It's the new school mascot.

25:42.130 --> 25:44.200
- We're Buccaneers.
- Not your school.

25:45.130 --> 25:47.619
- What was Gene working on?
- Time paradox...

25:48.130 --> 25:52.269
...accelerating particles out of our
continuum into their own universe.

25:52.930 --> 25:54.509
- Come again?
- Stopping time.

25:54.730 --> 25:57.049
Which is impossible.
No one can do it.

25:57.730 --> 26:01.059
Do they listen? No.
He gets the grants, I get the mold.

26:01.930 --> 26:05.410
Let's say he could do it,
let's say you could stop time,

26:06.130 --> 26:10.269
- How would it work?
- According to his speculations...

26:10.930 --> 26:15.210
...you focus the accelerators on a
point, Create the correct velocity...

26:16.329 --> 26:20.299
- ... whatever's there would be removed,
- Removed?

26:21.130 --> 26:22.640
From our reality,

26:22.930 --> 26:26.410
- What happens to it?
- Nothing, in the absolute sense,

26:27.130 --> 26:31.700
Whatever's in the field would stand
still forever, in its own universe,

26:34.329 --> 26:36.819
Say someone cranked this
into overdrive.

26:37.329 --> 26:41.509
If the field weren't contained,
it would spill out. Stop everything.

26:44.529 --> 26:45.470
Kind of wiggy.

26:45.730 --> 26:47.619
- Who can get in here?
- Only Gene.

26:48.130 --> 26:51.039
- Even maintenance has no access.
- No forced entry.

26:51.730 --> 26:55.309
- Why would Gene take his own stuff?
- Where would he take it?

27:08.730 --> 27:11.750
So there's another gear
after that number two?

27:12.329 --> 27:14.150
Relax, I'll pay for a tune-up.

27:14.730 --> 27:16.660
Unless the world ends.

27:17.130 --> 27:19.480
If it saves you some money, it's good.

27:20.130 --> 27:22.970
Your sourpussy mode is starting to grate.

27:23.730 --> 27:24.890
Your problem is--

27:24.930 --> 27:26.960
- You listening?
- Do I have a choice?

27:27.329 --> 27:30.279
- Your heart isn't in it.
- Technically, I have no heart.

27:30.930 --> 27:35.500
Someone puts a stake in it, you won't
have anything. So your heart counts.

27:36.329 --> 27:39.450
- What are you babbling about?
- Tell the truth.

27:40.529 --> 27:44.640
If the world ends tonight, would it
really, in your heart of hearts...

27:45.329 --> 27:47.579
...be such a terrible thing?

27:49.529 --> 27:53.460
- Now is that a fun place to be?
- I think you should shut up now.

27:53.730 --> 27:55.690
I'm the Host.
I never shut up.

27:56.130 --> 27:59.710
You distanced your friends.
You went from helping the helpless...

28:00.930 --> 28:04.789
...to hunting down the guilty.
Vengeance is for the lesser being.

28:05.130 --> 28:06.740
You're a champion, Angel.

28:07.529 --> 28:11.460
- I mean, you were, at least.
- What do you want me to tell you?

28:11.730 --> 28:14.779
Everything. Why your heart
stopped caring.

28:15.930 --> 28:18.460
The whole story so I can help you.

28:18.930 --> 28:20.789
No need to rush. We got time.

28:21.329 --> 28:24.630
You know, not a lot.

28:41.730 --> 28:44.890
You want to know what my problem is?
I'm screwed.

28:45.930 --> 28:48.559
I'm atoning for 100 years
of unthinkable evil.

28:48.930 --> 28:51.390
News flash! I can't.
Never gonna be enough.

28:51.930 --> 28:54.099
Now I got Wolfram & Hart dogging me.

28:54.329 --> 28:58.119
200 law school graduates working
full-time, driving me crazy.

28:59.130 --> 29:01.160
You're surprised it's working?

29:01.529 --> 29:03.670
"Angel, why are you so cranky?"

29:04.529 --> 29:07.200
"You should smile and wear a nice plaid."

29:07.529 --> 29:08.579
Not this season.

29:08.730 --> 29:12.140
Redemption. Darla had a shot
but they took it from her.

29:12.930 --> 29:15.740
Now I have to kill her.
I'm gonna do it.

29:16.529 --> 29:19.299
I'll kill her, then I'll burn that law firm.

29:20.130 --> 29:22.059
My crew couldn't handle that.

29:22.529 --> 29:26.319
Good. It means they're still human.
They're better off fired.

29:27.329 --> 29:30.589
- You left them in the cold.
- It's a lot colder in here.

29:35.130 --> 29:38.039
It's not always gonna be this way.
Things change.

29:38.730 --> 29:40.799
Unless we don't get there on time.

29:41.130 --> 29:45.519
In which case you'll be frozen
in this crappy mood forever.

29:46.529 --> 29:48.319
- We'll get there.
- Look out!

30:22.529 --> 30:24.670
- Hi.
- Hi.

30:24.930 --> 30:27.000
You look, uh....

30:31.529 --> 30:33.559
Well, happy anniversary.

30:45.609 --> 30:49.400
Good job, man.
We're very grateful.

30:49.809 --> 30:52.789
Yes, we found the killer.

30:54.009 --> 30:56.329
- But not the murderer.
- What's he saying?

30:56.410 --> 30:57.349
This demon was...

30:57.609 --> 30:59.470
...under someone else's control.

31:00.609 --> 31:02.500
Someone in this room.

31:04.809 --> 31:06.880
- Can we eat these?
- What do we know?

31:07.210 --> 31:10.859
When we arrived, there was a scent
of foxglove and hellebore.

31:11.410 --> 31:14.569
Not to keep this demon out,
but to keep him in...

31:15.009 --> 31:17.470
...so he could execute
the murderer's plan.

31:19.210 --> 31:22.829
Such a plan would require the skill
of a master wizard.

31:24.009 --> 31:26.819
I don't do that stuff anymore.

31:27.609 --> 31:32.180
Then we have the footprints in the
soft soil under the window outside.

31:33.009 --> 31:35.220
Too small to belong to this demon.

31:36.009 --> 31:37.970
Kevin told you.
Those were his.

31:38.410 --> 31:40.660
- He snuck in late last night.
- Loudly...

31:41.410 --> 31:42.599
...so all could hear.

31:42.609 --> 31:47.180
Supposedly from seeing that girl in town.
We all know Kevin is impotent...

31:48.009 --> 31:49.309
...why put on the show?

31:49.809 --> 31:52.089
Perhaps to cover for the real killer.

31:52.809 --> 31:56.000
Unless Kevin, in fact, is the real killer.

31:57.009 --> 31:59.640
With Derek gone, the inheritance is his...

32:00.609 --> 32:03.700
...the younger brother
and black sheep of the family.

32:05.410 --> 32:08.250
Unfortunately, you had neither
the opportunity...

32:09.009 --> 32:10.940
...nor the intelligence to do this.

32:10.809 --> 32:14.390
Sorry about the "impotent" remark.

32:15.609 --> 32:18.170
If Kevin was to have control
of the money...

32:18.609 --> 32:21.240
...who would have control of Kevin?

32:23.450 --> 32:24.890
Are there more of these--?

32:27.609 --> 32:28.799
Sorry.

32:29.410 --> 32:30.920
His sister?

32:31.809 --> 32:33.039
His mother?

32:33.609 --> 32:36.349
Both influence his life.
Both with agendas.

32:37.210 --> 32:41.779
But only one person knew the secret
that could blackmail Kevin for life.

32:42.609 --> 32:45.700
Only one person took pains
to hide their muddy shoes.

32:46.210 --> 32:48.740
Only one reeked
of foxglove and hellebore.

32:49.210 --> 32:53.210
Only one person was responsible
for the death of Derek Bointon.

32:54.009 --> 32:56.329
His own sweet, doting Aunt Helen!

32:57.609 --> 32:58.799
Helen?

32:58.809 --> 33:01.720
Not so fast, sister.

33:03.009 --> 33:05.259
That was cool.

33:05.410 --> 33:06.779
It wasn't difficult.

33:07.210 --> 33:10.619
You keep sifting the evidence
till the truth hits you.

33:39.049 --> 33:41.299
So how was scene class?

33:42.049 --> 33:43.980
Oh, you know.

33:45.049 --> 33:49.019
Jack thinks he can't play it
without a goatee.

33:49.849 --> 33:52.450
The footstool would have a goatee?

33:53.450 --> 33:55.869
Well, you know Jack.

34:01.849 --> 34:04.099
Thank you for the....

34:04.849 --> 34:06.109
It's really pretty.

34:07.250 --> 34:08.860
It made me think of you.

34:13.250 --> 34:14.690
Are you all done?

34:15.050 --> 34:18.239
Yeah. I'm not that hungry.

34:19.250 --> 34:23.429
It was good. It was really good.

34:25.849 --> 34:26.829
Hurry!

34:38.210 --> 34:40.139
That's sweet.

34:41.809 --> 34:43.768
I'm sorry about the clutter.

34:44.809 --> 34:47.018
It wouldn't be you without it.

35:23.210 --> 35:25.070
I love you.

35:42.409 --> 35:44.900
Where would I put a machine
to stop time?

35:45.409 --> 35:48.360
Probably where the demons
can guard it.

37:24.969 --> 37:27.389
Gene, we have to talk.

37:30.969 --> 37:32.300
I can't believe this,

37:33.369 --> 37:35.929
Listen, I am really, really sorry.

37:36.369 --> 37:38.860
I had no idea I was
endangering the world...

37:39.369 --> 37:41.900
...or that there were
all these demons.

37:42.969 --> 37:47.539
But aliens among us is consistent with
Murdoch's multiverse. I just....

37:49.570 --> 37:51.250
I didn't want her to leave.

37:57.969 --> 37:59.690
Well, you know....

38:00.369 --> 38:02.090
Love.

38:02.170 --> 38:04.170
It's a fire.

38:05.769 --> 38:06.929
You've been there.

38:06.969 --> 38:08.440
It burns you...

38:08.769 --> 38:09.679
...alive.

38:10.570 --> 38:13.590
Down to the bone.
Then it turns the bone to ash--

38:14.170 --> 38:16.380
What my chipper friend means is...

38:17.170 --> 38:19.449
...the wheel keeps turning.
It can't stop.

38:19.570 --> 38:21.849
Things may get worse or better.

38:22.570 --> 38:24.460
I want the wheel to stop.

38:25.570 --> 38:30.139
Which explains this time-in-a-box
disaster. I'm so sorry about that.

38:30.969 --> 38:33.320
It don't work, Gene.
It's like a song.

38:33.969 --> 38:37.730
I can hold a note a long time.
Actually, I can hold it forever.

38:38.170 --> 38:39.679
Eventually, that's noise.

38:40.570 --> 38:42.780
It's the change we're listening for.

38:42.969 --> 38:45.110
The note coming after and after that.

38:45.369 --> 38:47.159
That's what makes it music.

38:48.369 --> 38:49.809
I guess.

38:54.369 --> 38:55.949
You guys like beer?

38:56.769 --> 38:58.420
Beer sounds great.

39:02.170 --> 39:04.239
I'm glad you guys....

39:09.369 --> 39:11.760
You're connecting to a human.
It's a start.

39:12.369 --> 39:14.719
Go easy on the
bone-and-ash metaphors.

39:14.769 --> 39:17.820
He's a love disaster
and nearly destroyed the world.

39:18.969 --> 39:20.690
I can relate.

39:23.170 --> 39:27.489
- I did kind of leave them in the cold.
- Your buddies, by firing them?

39:29.769 --> 39:30.929
Yeah.

39:33.369 --> 39:35.860
I guess I made it pretty hard for them.

39:41.809 --> 39:42.679
Yeah!

40:00.409 --> 40:02.269
- Hi.
- How are you?

40:04.610 --> 40:05.690
You all right?

40:05.809 --> 40:07.179
I just....

40:07.610 --> 40:08.619
I need help.

40:08.809 --> 40:11.829
- This is Angel Investigations?
- That's right.

40:12.409 --> 40:14.659
Sorry about the confusion.

40:15.409 --> 40:18.500
We're having a celebration,
a new beginning.

40:19.010 --> 40:22.489
- Maybe I should--
- No. You need help, we can help.

40:23.210 --> 40:26.760
- We can talk in back. Come in.
- Which one of you is Angel?

40:31.610 --> 40:33.679
It's just a name.

41:12.409 --> 41:13.320
Thank you,

41:14.305 --> 41:20.533
