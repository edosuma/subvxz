00:03.971 --> 00:05.439
Previously on ER:

00:05.473 --> 00:07.241
If you can handle a relationship

00:07.275 --> 00:09.410
with no strings,
sex with no commitments.

00:09.443 --> 00:10.544
I'm all good.

00:10.578 --> 00:11.779
These are
really beautiful.

00:11.812 --> 00:13.481
It's kind
of embarrassing.

00:13.514 --> 00:14.682
Well, I had a good
time with you.

00:14.715 --> 00:15.583
I just wanted
to let you know.

00:15.616 --> 00:16.784
I'm Simon Brenner.

00:16.817 --> 00:17.818
Seems like
a nice bloke.

00:17.851 --> 00:18.552
Is that what you call it?

00:18.586 --> 00:19.520
I quit.

00:19.553 --> 00:21.255
I need something else.

00:21.289 --> 00:22.456
I'm talking about my marriage.

00:22.490 --> 00:23.591
I just...
I don't know if I can

00:23.624 --> 00:24.792
face it.

00:24.825 --> 00:26.460
Hi, Sheryl. I'm Dr. Rasgotra.

00:26.494 --> 00:30.464
Four kids.
23 years later, here I am.

00:30.498 --> 00:32.100
You shouldn't have
to go through this alone.

00:32.133 --> 00:33.767
It was my choice
to end our relationship.

00:33.801 --> 00:35.569
I'm letting you
off the hook.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.074

00:46.847 --> 00:49.750
Joe's still asleep.

00:49.783 --> 00:51.785
He had a rough night.

00:51.819 --> 00:56.490
Yeah. How many times
was he up? Three?

00:56.524 --> 00:58.126
Four.

01:02.630 --> 01:05.366
You have your interview today,
huh?

01:05.399 --> 01:07.601
Yeah.

01:24.652 --> 01:26.820
Are you looking
at apartments?

01:32.526 --> 01:34.228
What am I supposed to do?

01:34.262 --> 01:36.530
I told you the truth,
and that was not easy for me.

01:36.564 --> 01:37.831
And you know
how badly I feel,

01:37.865 --> 01:39.467
and how sorry I am.

01:39.500 --> 01:40.834
We're not doing this now.

01:40.868 --> 01:42.336
What? What do you want?
Just tell me.

01:42.370 --> 01:43.737
I swear to God,
I don't care what it is.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.839
I'll do it.
Did you think coming to Croatia

01:45.873 --> 01:48.176
and apologizing
was all it would take?

01:48.176 --> 01:49.477
No, I didn't.

01:49.510 --> 01:51.345
Well, you tell me
you were weak,

01:51.379 --> 01:54.382
you screwed up, you broke
my trust, you put our son

01:54.415 --> 01:55.883
in jeopardy-- what the
hell do you expect?!

01:55.916 --> 01:58.852
I don't know!

01:58.886 --> 02:01.789
I have to get ready
for this thing.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.624
We'll talk about it later.

02:03.657 --> 02:05.593
Will we?
I mean, that's all I'm asking.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.828
Well, we're not
doing to do it now, okay?

02:16.604 --> 02:18.339
Hey.

02:18.372 --> 02:19.373
Hey.

02:19.407 --> 02:21.209
Long time no see.

02:21.242 --> 02:22.476
I know.
The shift gods

02:22.510 --> 02:24.212
have been conspiring
against us.

02:24.212 --> 02:25.546
Well, I have
the perfect solution.

02:25.579 --> 02:28.849
How about a little romantic
getaway in Quebec?

02:28.882 --> 02:30.651
Quebec?

02:30.684 --> 02:32.520
It's called the
"Little France" of the Americas.

02:32.553 --> 02:34.722
I booked us into a B & B this
weekend, and I thought maybe...

02:34.755 --> 02:36.790
Shoot! I made plans
to do a wreck dive

02:36.824 --> 02:38.526
in Lake Michigan
with the guys.

02:38.559 --> 02:40.428
A wreck dive?

02:40.461 --> 02:42.296
Did I mention it's
called "Little France"?

02:42.330 --> 02:44.332
I'll try to
get out of it.

02:44.365 --> 02:46.400
Let's talk later, okay?
Okay.

02:46.434 --> 02:48.302
Hey, Morris. Doughnut?

02:48.336 --> 02:49.937
Yes! What's the occasion?

02:49.970 --> 02:51.505
Yeah, Gates.
I didn't see

02:51.539 --> 02:52.906
any reports
of hell freezing over.

02:52.940 --> 02:54.575
Oh, that hurts, Frank.

02:54.608 --> 02:56.244
Well, if you don't
want any doughnuts, big guy...

02:56.277 --> 02:58.379
Sorry I cast aspersions
on your generosity.

02:58.412 --> 02:59.947
Hey, Sam.

02:59.980 --> 03:02.250
Dr. Gates.

03:02.283 --> 03:04.252
Frank, labs back
on my deodorant eater?

03:04.252 --> 03:04.818
Negatory.

03:04.852 --> 03:05.953
Doughnut?

03:05.986 --> 03:07.288
What are you doing?

03:07.321 --> 03:08.822
I'm sorry.
You want a jelly?

03:08.856 --> 03:10.491
I thought we agreed to
keep this under wraps.

03:10.524 --> 03:11.959
You know,
be cool about us.

03:11.992 --> 03:13.961
What? It's a just a doughnut,
not a dozen roses.

03:13.994 --> 03:15.796
I bought for everyone.

03:15.829 --> 03:16.964
Sometimes a doughnut is
not just a doughnut, okay?

03:16.997 --> 03:19.300
So cut it out.

03:26.006 --> 03:27.508
Aha! There she is!

03:27.541 --> 03:29.543
Miss Croatia.

03:29.577 --> 03:30.678
So how was it?

03:30.711 --> 03:32.012
It was good. Thanks.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.981
And you did actually
go this time, right?

03:34.014 --> 03:36.317
Yes, I actually went.

03:36.350 --> 03:37.785
Abby, hey. Have
a nice vacation?

03:37.818 --> 03:38.819
Yeah.

03:38.852 --> 03:41.922
What the hell? Damn!

03:45.058 --> 03:47.728
(coughing)
You guys all right?

03:47.761 --> 03:49.697
Wow! What is that?
Gasoline?

03:49.730 --> 03:52.032
Underground tank erupted in a
geyser. Soaked him head to toe.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.767
I tried to cap it off.

03:53.801 --> 03:55.636
We hosed him off at the scene,
but the fumes were bad

03:55.669 --> 03:57.305
in the rig.
This guy needs
to be soaped down.

03:57.305 --> 03:58.439
Call HAZMAT.
We can get him cleaned up here.

03:58.472 --> 03:59.607
You two need to be looked at.

03:59.640 --> 04:02.376
Nah. We're fine.

04:02.410 --> 04:04.312
Whoa! Somebody
get a gurney!

04:04.345 --> 04:05.713
Hey! Put those cigarettes out!

04:05.746 --> 04:06.814
TAGGART:
Reidy, Reidy, are you okay?

04:06.847 --> 04:08.516
PRATT:
Is he breathing?

04:08.549 --> 04:09.583
TAGGART: Yeah. Wait,
hold on, don't get up.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.030
There's nothing wrong
with Internet dating.

04:23.063 --> 04:26.400
So what's the problem?

04:26.434 --> 04:27.735
Well, working
in a hospital--

04:27.768 --> 04:29.937
the hours, the intensity--
it can be alienating.

04:29.970 --> 04:33.674
There's no way to date
a normal person
in the real world.

04:33.707 --> 04:35.909
You don't think that
there are doctors online?

04:35.943 --> 04:38.346
Or, God forbid, other
hardworking professionals

04:38.379 --> 04:42.583
who might relate
even though they've never
heard of gentamonium?

04:42.616 --> 04:44.685
Gentamycin.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.654
I'm just saying.

04:46.687 --> 04:48.889
Happiness takes up space.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.891
Everyone has to make room
in their life for it.

04:50.924 --> 04:54.595
Not just doctors.

04:54.628 --> 04:57.531
Well, speaking of gentamycin,

04:57.565 --> 04:59.900
the cultures are still negative,
which is good.

04:59.933 --> 05:01.735
The fevers could be atelectasis,

05:01.769 --> 05:04.004
so three laps around
the ward today, okay?

05:04.037 --> 05:05.839
Cool. Hold on.

05:05.873 --> 05:09.643
I'm posting a profile
of you online.

05:09.677 --> 05:11.379
No, you're not.

05:11.412 --> 05:14.648
Yes, I am. I'm
pretending to be you.

05:14.682 --> 05:16.684
All right, then.

05:16.717 --> 05:20.821
I... I want a tall,
dark symphony conductor

05:20.854 --> 05:23.090
who is fluent in Italian,
with abs of steel.

05:23.123 --> 05:24.792
I'm on it.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.665
Hi. How is Mrs. Hawkins?

05:31.699 --> 05:33.667
Still running
a low-grade temp.

05:33.701 --> 05:35.536
The graft is infected.

05:35.569 --> 05:38.439
Are you sure?

05:38.472 --> 05:40.508
Well, couldn't that
be a hematoma?

05:40.541 --> 05:42.109
No. Not with the stranding
and irregular density.

05:42.142 --> 05:44.011
Switch her to linezolid.

05:44.044 --> 05:45.679
We'll take her up
to the OR in the morning.

05:45.713 --> 05:47.448
(pager buzzes)
Crap!

05:47.481 --> 05:48.682
Well, go ahead
and answer that.
I'll talk to Sheryl.

05:48.716 --> 05:50.551
No. It should come from me.

05:50.584 --> 05:51.752
It would be weird
if it came from someone else.

05:51.785 --> 05:54.522
(buzzing)
It's the ICU again.

05:54.555 --> 05:56.857
Look. Let me...
let me take care of this,

05:56.890 --> 05:58.759
and then I'll come back
and tell her.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.728
Okay. Meet me in the ER
when you're finished.

06:00.761 --> 06:02.095
We've got consults
piling up.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.632
Hey, we need a line.
I got it.

06:04.665 --> 06:06.467
Do I still have my eyebrows?

06:06.500 --> 06:08.469
They'll grow back.

06:08.502 --> 06:09.937
You burn yourself?

06:09.970 --> 06:11.772
Yeah. A little bit.

06:11.805 --> 06:12.940
Make sure you
get that checked out.

06:12.973 --> 06:13.974
Yeah, we've got this.

06:14.007 --> 06:15.509
Oh, she's fine.

06:15.543 --> 06:16.910
Sam, you don't need coddling,
right?

06:16.944 --> 06:18.746
A human fireball
in the ambulance bay.

06:18.779 --> 06:19.880
I love this place.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.549
Sats are good.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.617
Some singed nasal hairs,
but the lungs are clear.

06:23.651 --> 06:25.052
We got partial
thickness burns

06:25.085 --> 06:27.054
to both the hands.
Nothing circumferential.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.589
Burns are minimal.

06:28.622 --> 06:29.957
Maybe five percent BSA.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.725
You got lucky.

06:31.759 --> 06:32.893
We need a doctor
on the board.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.462
Brenner's not busy.

06:34.495 --> 06:35.663
Looks like he's
about to be.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.097
Who's Brenner?
New attending.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.866
Acts like he's
God's gift to medicine.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.534
And women.
Oh, great.

06:40.568 --> 06:41.935
We can always use
another one of those.

06:41.969 --> 06:43.904
All right, Abby,
you're with me.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.138
Admit Mr. Sacar
to the burn unit.

06:45.172 --> 06:46.206
I want to keep an eye
on his airway.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.676
All right.

06:48.709 --> 06:50.077
I've got to say,

06:50.110 --> 06:51.779
I was shocked
when Luka quit.

06:51.812 --> 06:53.747
I always thought
he'd be a lifer here.

06:53.781 --> 06:56.584
Yeah. Well, change
is probably a
good thing, right?

06:56.617 --> 06:58.819
Is that why you canceled
your interview with Anspaugh?

06:58.852 --> 07:00.087
I didn't cancel it.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.955
I just postponed it,
that's all.

07:01.989 --> 07:03.957
I'm going to see what's
happening with Luka first.

07:03.991 --> 07:05.893
Abby, you've got 14 candidates
going for one attending slot.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.060
It'll be gone before

07:07.094 --> 07:09.062
you get a chance
to reschedule.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.598
And, in three months,
you're going to find
yourself out of a job.

07:10.631 --> 07:11.965
Pratt, I need
a doctor here.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.934
I'm on with
nephrology.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.969
Got it.
Kwan Lee, 19.

07:16.003 --> 07:17.871
He got jumped
on the El platform on Addison.

07:17.905 --> 07:19.740
Hi, Kwan. I'm Dr. Lockhart.
What happened?

07:19.773 --> 07:22.042
I was waiting for the train.

07:22.075 --> 07:23.944
These guys pulled me
off the bench.

07:23.977 --> 07:25.045
Vitals stable.

07:25.078 --> 07:26.514
18 gauge in the antecube.

07:26.514 --> 07:27.515
All right, on my count.

07:27.548 --> 07:29.583
Ready? One, two, three.

07:29.617 --> 07:32.953
I tried to run away.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.922
Pulse 122, sat 98.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.624
Lungs sound good.

07:36.657 --> 07:37.991
You have any family
you want us to call, Kwan?

07:38.025 --> 07:40.127
They're in Seoul.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.261
What's your plan?

07:41.294 --> 07:43.964
CBC, trauma panel, chest X-ray,

07:43.997 --> 07:45.733
(coughing)
c-spine and
radial/ulnar series.

07:45.766 --> 07:49.703
Oh, my God.

07:49.737 --> 07:50.971
It's okay.
What's the sat?

07:51.004 --> 07:54.141
98. I think I said that.

07:54.174 --> 07:56.544
Just a little bit of blood.
It's probably from your nose.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.612
I want to go back to Korea.

07:58.646 --> 08:00.681
Chicago isn't
working out.

08:00.714 --> 08:01.949
So, come on. More
about your new hottie.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.584
"Hottie" is too
reductive a word.

08:03.617 --> 08:05.218
You're killing me!

08:05.252 --> 08:06.820
Dr. Morris, if dialysis
won't unlock your AV shunt,

08:06.854 --> 08:08.656
we'll revise it in the OR.
Thanks, Lucien.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.023
She's hot. Yes, she's hot.

08:10.057 --> 08:11.892
But she's also...
she's complex,

08:11.925 --> 08:15.062
innovative. She's...
she's kind of earthy.

08:15.095 --> 08:16.797
It's completely
unprecedented.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.599
I know you know
what I'm talking about.

08:18.632 --> 08:19.767
Shut up.

08:19.800 --> 08:20.801
Who is she?

08:20.834 --> 08:22.235
No comment.

08:22.269 --> 08:23.704
Where did you meet?

08:23.737 --> 08:25.773
All I'll say is
I love this new job.

08:25.806 --> 08:27.741
I knew it! She works here.

08:27.775 --> 08:30.143
Lucien, shampoo man is going
to follow up with you

08:30.177 --> 08:31.745
as an outpatient, okay?

08:31.779 --> 08:33.179
If he must.
Lunch later?

08:33.212 --> 08:35.215
That could work.

08:35.248 --> 08:36.950
My office, 2:00?

08:36.984 --> 08:41.188
I'll try to make it.

08:41.221 --> 08:42.690
Hey.

08:42.722 --> 08:44.157
Hey.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.759
She is so hot!

08:45.793 --> 08:47.327
Missy Voltaire,
restrained driver,

08:47.360 --> 08:49.329
minivan T-boned
by an SUV.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.898
Haleh, page OB. Let's get
the ultrasound in there.

08:50.931 --> 08:52.600
When are you due,
Missy?

08:52.633 --> 08:54.635
Next month. My husband's
going to freak.

08:54.668 --> 08:56.770
He's been totally superstitious
about the pregnancy.

08:56.804 --> 08:57.771
Is this your first baby?

08:57.805 --> 08:59.640
No. It's our 13th.

08:59.673 --> 09:01.041
So, you did
break your arm.

09:01.074 --> 09:03.343
See? There's
your fracture right there.

09:03.376 --> 09:06.614
No, no, no. I've got
a critique in a week,

09:06.647 --> 09:08.816
and I've got
all the z-depths to do.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.350
What are you
talking about?

09:10.383 --> 09:14.354
I'm a freshman
at the Art Institute.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.889
I study animation.

09:15.923 --> 09:17.024
Can we take this collar off?

09:17.057 --> 09:18.859
Sure. Laverne, come here.

09:18.892 --> 09:22.162
I'll show you
how to clear a c-spine.

09:22.195 --> 09:24.832
I'm going to work my way
down your vertebrae, okay?

09:24.865 --> 09:26.967
That sounds fun.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.335
Let me know if anything hurts.

09:28.368 --> 09:29.970
All, right,
you're looking for tenderness,

09:30.003 --> 09:34.241
step-offs, any
other irregularities.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.644
How long have you had this?

09:36.677 --> 09:40.380
I'm not sure.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.716
It's a bit fluctuant.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.117
Is it infected?

09:44.151 --> 09:45.753
Could be a node
or a cyst.

09:45.786 --> 09:46.954
Hey, Abby, Morris could use

09:46.987 --> 09:48.221
some extra
hands in here.

09:48.255 --> 09:49.857
Coming.

09:49.890 --> 09:51.759
I'll talk to surgery.
Surgery?

09:51.792 --> 09:53.160
Yeah. Just to get
a second opinion.

09:53.193 --> 09:54.728
I'll be back in a minute
to explain it to you.

09:54.762 --> 09:56.296
I got this.

09:56.329 --> 09:58.666
Came over to meet the
famous Abby Lockhart.

09:58.699 --> 10:00.367
I'm Simon Brenner.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.735
Your reputation precedes you.

10:01.769 --> 10:03.036
Right back at you.

10:03.070 --> 10:05.172
How can we help?
They all have D names?

10:05.205 --> 10:08.776
This is Missy,
35 weeks, G13, P12.
Daria, Dylan, Derek, Diana...

10:08.809 --> 10:11.812
Abby, will you do
an ultrasound, please?
...Delilah, Dalton and Daisy.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.747
So, are you Catholic?
No.

10:13.781 --> 10:16.183
Mormon?
No.

10:16.216 --> 10:19.987
Just really,
really fertile.
Yeah.

10:20.020 --> 10:22.322
Baby's very active.

10:22.355 --> 10:23.757
Oh, God!
You should see after I eat.

10:23.791 --> 10:24.925
It's like Riverdance in there.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.827
Chest and pelvis
are stable.

10:26.860 --> 10:28.395
Yeah. After number eight,
my husband got a vasectomy.

10:28.428 --> 10:29.930
Three months later-- poof!--
I'm pregnant again.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.765
His boys refused
to be held back, eh?

10:31.799 --> 10:33.200
Yeah. We took it

10:33.233 --> 10:34.768
as a sign we were
supposed to keep going.

10:34.802 --> 10:35.836
OB's here.
What have you got?

10:35.869 --> 10:37.004
35-weeker,

10:37.037 --> 10:38.739
G13, P12.

10:38.772 --> 10:41.241
13 kids?! Are you out
of your frigging mind?

10:41.274 --> 10:43.777
Haleh, CBC,
chem 7, LFTs,

10:43.811 --> 10:45.278
type and cross for four.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.280
You want to add
a Kleihauer-Betke test?

10:47.314 --> 10:49.316
Ooh! ER docs never remember
to order that.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.184
That's not true.

10:51.218 --> 10:55.222
Fetal heart rate 156,
amniotic index perfect.

10:55.255 --> 10:58.025
Let's monitor the fetus for a
couple of hours just to be sure.

10:58.058 --> 10:59.827
Continuous FHT.

10:59.860 --> 11:02.229
I'll be back to
check the strip.

11:02.262 --> 11:04.031
Got a minute?
Uh-huh.

11:04.064 --> 11:08.135
I'm very curious why
a physician with your experience

11:08.168 --> 11:10.871
would want to work
in palliative care.

11:10.904 --> 11:13.406
Why would you
want to give up the...

11:13.440 --> 11:16.977
Emily, good morning.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.346
...the adrenaline rush
of the ER?

11:19.379 --> 11:21.014
I've reached a point
where I feel

11:21.048 --> 11:22.983
I need to make
a change, you know?

11:23.016 --> 11:27.888
I, um... I'm looking to
refocus my energies.

11:27.921 --> 11:28.889
Oh. I see.

11:28.922 --> 11:30.924
And, uh...

11:30.958 --> 11:32.960
my father died a short time ago.

11:32.993 --> 11:35.095
Oh, I'm very sorry to hear that.

11:35.128 --> 11:37.264
I cared for him
during his illness,

11:37.297 --> 11:39.366
and I was with
him when he died.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.201
WOMAN:
Are you calling
me a liar?

11:41.234 --> 11:42.803
I'm just trying to help.

11:42.836 --> 11:43.904
Will you excuse me
for just a moment?

11:43.937 --> 11:45.105
Sure. Take your time.

11:45.138 --> 11:46.907
Please feel free
to look around.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.475
WOMAN:
What happened to it?

11:48.508 --> 11:51.511
When my granddaughter
comes to visit me, I'm going...

11:51.544 --> 11:53.313
Hi. Nice to see you.

12:05.092 --> 12:06.794
Bull hockey!

12:06.794 --> 12:09.830
Cheese and crackers!

12:12.499 --> 12:15.135
Hey, hey!

12:15.168 --> 12:16.203
You play cards?

12:16.236 --> 12:17.905
Uh, sure.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.239
Good.

12:19.272 --> 12:21.809
I'm dying
for some real action.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.977
Actually, I'm dying of cancer.

12:24.011 --> 12:25.012
Sit.

12:25.045 --> 12:27.981
We'll play five-card draw.

12:28.015 --> 12:29.950
Nothing wild
but the dealer.

12:29.983 --> 12:32.385
Sit!

12:37.891 --> 12:39.226
(chuckles)

12:41.394 --> 12:42.395
Luka Kovac.

12:42.429 --> 12:47.467
Walter Perkins.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.169
You visiting family?

12:49.202 --> 12:52.372
No, I'm actually here
for a job interview.

12:52.405 --> 12:55.142
Oh. What line
of work you in?

12:55.175 --> 12:57.010
I'm a doctor.

12:57.044 --> 12:59.847
I used to work in the ER
at County General.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.515
Can I have three?

13:02.549 --> 13:05.953
Used to? What, you get fired?

13:05.986 --> 13:07.287
No.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.422
Why in Sam Hill would you want
to work here?

13:09.456 --> 13:12.259
Every morning I wake up,
there's another empty bed.

13:12.292 --> 13:15.495
Let's just say I'm trying
to make some changes

13:15.528 --> 13:17.530
in my life, okay?

13:17.564 --> 13:19.199
You want some advice?

13:19.232 --> 13:20.400
Run from this place
and don't look back.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.035
Take me with you when you go.

13:22.069 --> 13:24.371
A straight flush.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.878
You want to play for money?

13:30.878 --> 13:32.545
ABBY:
He's distant and angry.

13:32.579 --> 13:35.983
It's like not one thing
I do or say isn't wrong.

13:36.016 --> 13:37.517
It makes sense
that there would be

13:37.550 --> 13:39.252
a period of time
like this.

13:39.286 --> 13:41.054
Yeah, after I got over
there and I told him,

13:41.088 --> 13:43.356
I kept waiting for it
to get easier, you know?

13:43.390 --> 13:45.926
I kept thinking,
"Okay, the bad part's
gonna be over now."

13:45.959 --> 13:47.160
It's not easy
to be patient.

13:47.194 --> 13:49.262
I don't know.

13:49.296 --> 13:51.031
He's planning things, you know,
without including me.

13:51.064 --> 13:53.366
And he's applying for jobs
without discussing it with me.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.502
He was looking at the
real estate section today.

13:55.535 --> 13:56.636
What does that mean?

13:56.669 --> 13:59.973
This is what you signed up for.

14:00.007 --> 14:01.374
He gets to make the next move.

14:01.408 --> 14:02.976
You get to wait.

14:08.315 --> 14:09.416
SIMON:
Do you always use propofol
for reductions?

14:09.449 --> 14:11.118
Mm-hmm.
It's a great drug;

14:11.151 --> 14:14.521
short half life, easy
to titrate, very safe.

14:14.554 --> 14:16.924
Shoulder doesn't seem
to want to go back.

14:16.924 --> 14:18.658
You want some counter
traction there, old boy?

14:18.691 --> 14:20.493
No, I'm good, thanks.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.329
Ortho generally prefers
scapular manipulation.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.331
Maybe we should let
Skye here take a shot.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.666
You look fit enough to pop
that thing back into place.

14:26.699 --> 14:27.667
I'm more about

14:27.700 --> 14:29.369
finesse than force.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.438
I'll remember that.

14:31.471 --> 14:33.640
Fine. Dr. Wexler, take a shot.

14:33.673 --> 14:36.209
Okay, Simon, we can
take it from here.

14:36.243 --> 14:37.410
Then take it.

14:37.444 --> 14:39.546
We're good
here, thanks.

14:41.281 --> 14:42.950
And shoulder's in.
Wow.

14:42.950 --> 14:44.484
Would you stop
the propofol?

14:44.517 --> 14:45.518
That was fast.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.287
I'm good.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.389
Yeah, even the new
attending recognizes that.

14:49.422 --> 14:51.058
Brenner?

14:51.091 --> 14:53.026
He's the kind of guy
you want to hate,

14:53.060 --> 14:54.261
but somehow can't.

14:54.294 --> 14:55.695
I totally know
what you mean.

14:55.728 --> 14:57.264
Yeah, totally.

14:57.297 --> 14:59.666
Hey, you gonna fix my arm
or what?

14:59.699 --> 15:00.700
It's all done.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.602
What?

15:02.635 --> 15:05.172
The sedative we gave you
can cause you to sort of lose

15:05.205 --> 15:07.407
the few minutes right before
we gave you the medicine.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.276
Milk of Amnesia
strikes again.

15:11.078 --> 15:12.980
Okay, all done.

15:12.980 --> 15:15.315
Can you run that
to the lab for me?

15:15.348 --> 15:17.650
This is what I thought
America would look like

15:17.684 --> 15:20.353
before I came here.

15:20.387 --> 15:21.388
I wanted to come here

15:21.421 --> 15:23.090
ever since I was ten.

15:23.123 --> 15:25.358
Sounds like you were
a very ambitious kid.

15:25.392 --> 15:28.061
That's not what
my parents thought.

15:28.095 --> 15:31.398
They said art was a hobby,
not a career.

15:31.431 --> 15:34.134
Well, my family were the same.
Science or nothing.

15:34.167 --> 15:35.602
Hi. I'm Dr. Rasgotra

15:35.635 --> 15:39.239
come to check out
this neck thing.

15:39.272 --> 15:46.746
I could not afford the tuition,
but I sent my portfolio anyway.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.216
You got a scholarship?

15:49.249 --> 15:53.186
Partial. My parents had to give
up a lot to send me here.

15:53.220 --> 15:55.388
I'm sure they're
very proud, Kwan.

15:55.422 --> 15:59.059
I don't know.

15:59.092 --> 16:03.630
I didn't expect people
to be so...

16:04.464 --> 16:06.499
I don't know.

16:06.533 --> 16:07.700
What do you think?

16:07.734 --> 16:09.102
It's probably
an infected cyst.

16:09.136 --> 16:10.203
I can do an I and D
if you want.

16:10.237 --> 16:11.504
What's an I and D?

16:11.538 --> 16:12.772
Incision

16:12.805 --> 16:14.307
and drainage.
I'll open up the area

16:14.341 --> 16:15.442
and clean it out.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.144
Open it up? I don't understand.

16:17.177 --> 16:18.745
It's a very
simple procedure.

16:18.778 --> 16:20.447
It's just to make sure the
fluid doesn't re-accumulate.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.150
Can this wait until I'm home?

16:23.183 --> 16:24.584
I know it's hard
to be far away,

16:24.617 --> 16:27.520
but you're here now,
so let us take care of this.

16:27.554 --> 16:29.789
Dr. Brenner, labs are back
on your guy with the ear worm.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.658
One step ahead of you, Frank.

16:31.691 --> 16:34.094
Wired to receive lab reports
so I get 'em anywhere, anytime.

16:34.127 --> 16:35.095
Really?

16:35.128 --> 16:36.463
Sure. Take a look.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.131
Doesn't that raise
confidentiality issues?

16:38.165 --> 16:39.399
Loosen up, Greg.

16:39.432 --> 16:41.301
Oh, excuse me.

16:41.334 --> 16:44.071
Wow, if I'm the uptight one,
then this is bizarro ER.

16:44.104 --> 16:45.672
SIMON:
Hey, I was just
thinking about you.

16:45.705 --> 16:48.175
Get a sputum sample from
the homeless guy in three,

16:48.208 --> 16:49.676
nursing man needs
a new diaper,

16:49.709 --> 16:51.244
and swab the dripping
ulcer on the diabetic.

16:51.278 --> 16:53.146
I was gonna have
Dawn help you out,

16:53.180 --> 16:54.681
but I figured you could
handle it yourself.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.416
Anyone seen Dr. Brenner?

16:56.449 --> 16:58.151
He's around
here somewhere.

16:58.185 --> 16:59.819
Yeah, he still has
a few more asses to pinch.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.489
What was that, Doctor?

17:02.522 --> 17:04.723
Anspaugh, where'd you find
this guy?

17:04.757 --> 17:06.159
He's a piece of work.

17:06.193 --> 17:07.260
Is he?

17:07.294 --> 17:08.761
Yeah, and I don't want

17:08.795 --> 17:10.163
to be the boy who cries wolf,
but this guy...

17:10.196 --> 17:11.731
He's a wolf.

17:11.763 --> 17:13.700
I'm sorry to hear that.
He did his residency

17:13.733 --> 17:15.734
in one of the finest hospitals
in Melbourne.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.704
Maybe so, but somehow
he ended up without
a clue on how...

17:17.737 --> 17:18.838
Uncle Donnie.

17:18.871 --> 17:22.108
To what do I owe this pleasure?

17:22.809 --> 17:24.176
"Uncle Donnie"?

17:24.211 --> 17:25.811
You're his uncle?

17:25.845 --> 17:27.314
My sister had a brief
disastrous tryst

17:27.347 --> 17:29.182
with an Aussie
back in the 70s.

17:29.216 --> 17:30.583
I've been trying
to lure Simon

17:30.617 --> 17:32.385
to the northern
hemisphere for years.

17:32.419 --> 17:34.487
Think you can squeeze in
a lunch at the faculty club?

17:34.521 --> 17:35.622
I'd like to introduce
you around.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.424
Mm-hmm.

17:37.457 --> 17:39.226
You can survive without
Simon for a few hours,

17:39.259 --> 17:41.128
right, Greg?
Definitely.

17:41.128 --> 17:42.195
Excuse me.

17:42.229 --> 17:43.630
Is my wife here?

17:43.663 --> 17:45.132
Car crash, very pregnant?

17:45.165 --> 17:47.334
Missy and the baby
are doing great.

17:49.236 --> 17:53.840
And you, young lady,
you must be... Daisy, huh?

17:53.873 --> 17:55.742
Your mom told me
all about you.

17:57.177 --> 17:58.178
I'll take you to her.

17:58.211 --> 18:00.180
Thank you.

18:00.213 --> 18:02.582
Sam, can we get some videos for
these kids in the family room?

18:02.615 --> 18:04.584
ANSPAUGH:
Meet me out
front in five?

18:04.617 --> 18:08.421
I am so glad
this is all working out.

18:09.789 --> 18:11.358
I heard the attending
interviews were today.

18:11.391 --> 18:12.359
What time's yours?

18:12.392 --> 18:13.360
I postponed it.

18:13.393 --> 18:14.727
Really? Why?

18:14.761 --> 18:16.396
I, I'm still just,
I don't know.

18:16.429 --> 18:17.897
I'm trying to get used
to the time change.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.766
Well, it's good
to have you back.
Thanks.

18:19.799 --> 18:22.335
It's a child-life
emergency, please.

18:22.369 --> 18:23.836
I have Swiss Family
Robinson here.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.472
I'm not kidding.

18:25.505 --> 18:28.741
A DVD player, a Nintendo,
a coloring book.

18:28.775 --> 18:32.745
Steal from the PICU,
I don't care.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.247
(sighs)

18:38.885 --> 18:40.687
Do you think
we could talk later?

18:40.720 --> 18:43.523
I'm a little busy now.
That's why I said "later."

18:43.556 --> 18:46.893
If it's one of those
"amends" conversations,

18:46.926 --> 18:48.461
I'd rather not.

18:49.896 --> 18:51.431
It's five minutes.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.933
That's all I'm asking.

18:53.966 --> 18:57.370
Look, Abby, this is not
a good day for me, okay?

19:02.875 --> 19:06.846
When they told me it had spread,
there was no one for me to tell,

19:06.879 --> 19:10.517
so I figured that's it.
I'll go back to Cayeaux.

19:10.550 --> 19:11.684
Where?

19:11.718 --> 19:13.453
Cayeaux-Sur-Mer.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.555
It's a little town
on the coast of France.

19:15.588 --> 19:18.625
Spent some time there
in the service

19:18.658 --> 19:21.761
right after D-Day.

19:21.794 --> 19:24.297
Met a girl.

19:25.898 --> 19:32.539
I promised her when I left
I'd see her again someday.

19:32.572 --> 19:33.906
Did you?

19:33.940 --> 19:37.244
No.

19:37.277 --> 19:39.446
But when they told me I was
dying, I wanted to go.

19:39.479 --> 19:43.716
Then the doctor said I couldn't,
there wasn't time.

19:43.750 --> 19:49.356
Now look at me.
Stuck in this place.

19:49.389 --> 19:53.793
Could have been to Europe
and back five times by now.

19:53.826 --> 19:56.496
I just made my first trip
back home to Croatia

19:56.529 --> 19:59.266
in almost ten years.

19:59.299 --> 20:01.501
Why'd you stay away so long?

20:01.534 --> 20:02.902
Two.

20:02.935 --> 20:07.006
When I left, it was,
it was a difficult time.

20:07.039 --> 20:11.578
Um, I was determined
to forget everything.

20:11.611 --> 20:14.747
Forget what?

20:14.781 --> 20:15.882
It's much better now.

20:15.915 --> 20:17.584
It's an amazing place.

20:17.617 --> 20:19.819
But back then, you know
things were bad.

20:19.852 --> 20:22.755
There was a lot of chaos
and destruction.

20:22.789 --> 20:26.459
Oh, you mean the war?

20:26.493 --> 20:30.763
When I left, I-I-I thought
I'd never go back.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.803
It's called healing
by secondary intention.

20:36.836 --> 20:40.773
The hole gets smaller
as the wound heals
from the bottom up.

20:40.807 --> 20:43.510
Did you like Yale
when you first got there?

20:43.543 --> 20:46.479
Uh, it was lonely,
but it gets better.
Give it time.

20:46.513 --> 20:48.781
Trauma Two.

20:48.815 --> 20:49.982
Hey, it's Simon. Is that Sam?

20:50.016 --> 20:51.651
You got me.

20:51.684 --> 20:53.453
I just got a lab report back
on my new phone.

20:53.486 --> 20:55.288
Wanted to let you know.

20:55.322 --> 20:58.658
Sparkling's fine and the, uh,
grilled radicchio...

20:58.691 --> 21:00.560
Cut.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.762
Anyway, cytology came back
on the Korean kid Kwan Lee:

21:02.795 --> 21:05.698
Dr. Brenner,
you're on speakerphone.

21:05.732 --> 21:06.733
High-grade large-cell lymphoma.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.401
Dr. Brenner!

21:08.435 --> 21:09.936
Kid's got cancer,
node's full of blasts.

21:09.969 --> 21:12.772
Looks very aggressive.
Tough break for the...

21:16.709 --> 21:18.945
It's an infection...

21:18.978 --> 21:20.012
NEELA:
Kwan...

21:20.046 --> 21:21.914
That's what you said!

21:21.948 --> 21:23.550
You said it was
an infection!

21:23.583 --> 21:24.817
No big deal!
That's what you said!

21:24.851 --> 21:25.852
Look, it's probably early.

21:25.885 --> 21:26.853
It's good

21:26.886 --> 21:28.421
that we caught this.

21:28.455 --> 21:29.489
No, shut up! Shut up!
I don't have cancer!

21:29.522 --> 21:31.057
I'm 19 years old.

21:31.090 --> 21:32.792
I was mugged!
I don't have cancer!

21:32.825 --> 21:34.527
Okay, just settle down, okay?

21:34.561 --> 21:35.695
Get me out of here.

21:35.728 --> 21:36.696
Kwan...

21:36.729 --> 21:37.697
I don't have cancer.

21:37.730 --> 21:39.065
I want to go home.

21:39.098 --> 21:40.833
Get me out of here.

21:45.505 --> 21:47.507
What's going on?

21:47.540 --> 21:48.708
I want to go.

21:48.741 --> 21:50.009
What'd you just give him?

21:50.042 --> 21:51.844
Propofol. This never happened.

21:56.916 --> 21:58.551
After all he's been through,
he did not need to learn

21:58.585 --> 22:00.587
he had cancer from some
crank over the speakerphone.

22:00.620 --> 22:02.121
Oh, okay, so your plan
was to erase his memory?

22:02.154 --> 22:03.590
He could be allergic
to the medicine.

22:03.623 --> 22:04.924
He could stop breathing.

22:04.957 --> 22:05.925
I know the risk
of propofol, all right?

22:05.958 --> 22:07.093
He's waking up.

22:07.126 --> 22:08.428
Come here.

22:12.131 --> 22:13.866
He's a terrified kid
all alone.

22:13.900 --> 22:15.768
Yeah, we could have helped
him deal with that.

22:15.802 --> 22:17.504
This moment was going
to haunt him

22:17.537 --> 22:19.406
for the rest of his life,
how ever long that is.

22:19.406 --> 22:20.473
So why not take it away?

22:20.507 --> 22:21.741
Start over, do it better.

22:21.774 --> 22:23.410
Because that's
not how it works.

22:23.410 --> 22:25.044
I know how it works...

22:25.077 --> 22:26.112
Look, it's our job
to deal with the
consequences,

22:26.145 --> 22:27.914
even if we've screwed up.

22:27.947 --> 22:29.416
You can't just pretend
something never happened.

22:29.449 --> 22:30.717
Oh, well, thank you
for the lesson.

22:34.086 --> 22:35.788
Look, I'll review
the slides with oncology

22:35.822 --> 22:38.458
and confirm the diagnosis
before I tell him.

22:38.491 --> 22:40.627
He's my patient.
How about I deal with it.

22:42.128 --> 22:44.697
Hi.
Hey.

22:47.567 --> 22:51.604
So how long do I have
to stay here?

22:51.638 --> 22:53.740
I'm kind of starving.

22:53.773 --> 22:56.443
Well, Sam could get
you a tray.

22:56.443 --> 22:58.878
No reason he has
to be NPO, right?

23:01.047 --> 23:04.083
Listen, um, Kwan, is there
anybody here in Chicago

23:04.116 --> 23:05.452
that could pick you up?

23:05.452 --> 23:07.720
I'm fine on the El.

23:07.754 --> 23:10.457
I know, but just, um...

23:10.490 --> 23:12.191
You know after the procedure
and everything,

23:12.224 --> 23:13.826
I would feel more comfortable

23:13.860 --> 23:15.828
if there was someone
to drive you home.

23:15.862 --> 23:17.730
Is there anybody
from school?

23:17.764 --> 23:19.499
A roommate maybe?

23:19.532 --> 23:21.200
My RA might come.

23:21.233 --> 23:24.136
She's kind of weird, but
she's always been nice to me.

23:24.170 --> 23:26.539
Okay, well, let's call her.

23:27.206 --> 23:30.877
Thank you.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.679
Sure.

23:32.712 --> 23:36.549
So what brought
you to Chicago?

23:36.583 --> 23:38.885
County General.

23:38.918 --> 23:40.887
I thought I'd
dive into work,

23:40.920 --> 23:44.957
and leave everything behind,
but it's not so easy.

23:44.991 --> 23:49.796
On a good day you maybe
delay death for a while,

23:49.829 --> 23:54.000
but you never really beat it.

23:54.033 --> 23:57.003
You should try stand-up comedy.

23:57.036 --> 23:59.872
You're a gloomy
bastard.

23:59.906 --> 24:01.708
Sorry.

24:01.741 --> 24:04.544
What made you decide
to go back home then?

24:04.577 --> 24:06.779
My father got sick.

24:06.813 --> 24:10.917
I-I-I thought I can
maybe fix things.

24:10.950 --> 24:16.222
Bring him back to Chicago,
find him the best oncologist.

24:16.255 --> 24:18.190
He wouldn't leave.

24:18.224 --> 24:21.828
No, he wanted to stay
in his country,

24:21.861 --> 24:24.263
surrounded by the
people he loved.

24:24.296 --> 24:28.200
He decided he wants to
die there-- like that.

24:28.234 --> 24:30.537
Good for him.

24:32.271 --> 24:36.075
At first I felt angry,
you know, betrayed.

24:36.108 --> 24:37.877
Why, because he didn't
want to fight?

24:40.813 --> 24:44.183
But eventually I let go of it.

24:44.216 --> 24:48.087
You know, I... I just tried
to be there for him.

24:48.120 --> 24:50.823
So what, you learned
you can't fix things?

24:50.857 --> 24:53.726
That made you feel this might
be a good place for you?

24:53.760 --> 24:54.794
(chuckles)

24:54.827 --> 24:56.896
Kind of.

24:58.164 --> 25:00.299
Two pairs.

25:00.332 --> 25:02.101
Two kings and two fours.

25:02.134 --> 25:04.637
Aces over eights.

25:04.671 --> 25:08.741
I believe they call that
"The Dead Man's Hand."

25:08.775 --> 25:13.646
Hey, uh, listen, if
I'm canceling the hotel,
I should let them know.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.181
It's the wreck of
the Northerner.

25:15.214 --> 25:17.049
A schooner
from the 1800s.

25:17.083 --> 25:18.885
Must have been there
for over 200 years.

25:18.918 --> 25:20.953
It should still be there
after this weekend.

25:20.987 --> 25:22.622
Um...

25:22.655 --> 25:24.123
Okay, Little France
will have to wait.

25:24.156 --> 25:26.726
I'm sorry you went
through all that trouble.

25:26.759 --> 25:28.294
I feel bad bailing
at the last minute,

25:28.327 --> 25:31.598
and I really want
to do the dive.

25:31.598 --> 25:33.600
Okay.

25:34.701 --> 25:38.771
Hey, what if I came with you?

25:38.805 --> 25:40.106
Do you even dive?

25:40.139 --> 25:41.808
Once, in Belize.

25:41.841 --> 25:43.109
Kind of hated it.

25:43.142 --> 25:45.612
But I could hang
out on the boat,

25:45.612 --> 25:48.881
mix martinis, wait
for you to come up.

25:48.915 --> 25:50.883
It'll be cold
and boring.

25:51.918 --> 25:53.753
Really?

25:53.786 --> 25:55.321
I'll see if there's room.

25:56.789 --> 25:58.658
I've had it with Brenner.

25:58.691 --> 26:00.660
Anspaugh's Australian
love child?

26:00.693 --> 26:03.630
I'm pretty sure that nephew
story's just a cover-up.

26:03.663 --> 26:04.931
Brenner's not so bad.

26:04.964 --> 26:07.066
I think he has
a refreshing energy.

26:07.099 --> 26:08.835
And I think you've
got a man crush.

26:08.868 --> 26:10.770
Don't be ridiculous. What...?

26:10.803 --> 26:12.772
I see the way you look at him.

26:12.805 --> 26:15.908
Just because I can see
the appeal of another man...

26:16.976 --> 26:18.244
Forget it.

26:18.277 --> 26:19.979
Besides, having
an extra attending

26:20.012 --> 26:22.782
might make it so you can
spend some time with Betina.

26:22.815 --> 26:24.216
When's the surgery?

26:24.250 --> 26:25.718
I have no idea.

26:25.752 --> 26:27.219
We broke up.

26:27.253 --> 26:29.155
Oh, no, oh, no.

26:29.188 --> 26:31.691
Please tell me you didn't
bail on your sick girlfriend.

26:31.724 --> 26:33.159
No, I didn't bail--
she did.

26:33.192 --> 26:35.127
And I have to respect
what she wants, right?

26:35.161 --> 26:36.162
She wants flowers,
cupcakes--

26:36.195 --> 26:38.197
women love cupcakes.

26:38.230 --> 26:40.332
Are you listening to
anything that I'm saying?
Yes. Yes, I am.

26:40.366 --> 26:42.268
Betina is
pushing you away

26:42.301 --> 26:44.003
because she's afraid
to depend on you.

26:44.036 --> 26:45.805
If you don't see that,
you're an idiot.

26:45.838 --> 26:47.039
Oh, wow, wow.

26:47.073 --> 26:48.240
Thanks, Morris.

26:48.274 --> 26:49.842
But you know what?

26:49.876 --> 26:51.310
I really don't need
romantic advice

26:51.343 --> 26:52.879
from a guy whose only
lasting relationship

26:52.912 --> 26:56.182
was with
an inflatable doll.

26:56.215 --> 27:00.386
Cupcakes... with sprinkles.

27:06.092 --> 27:08.227
Damn it.

27:08.260 --> 27:11.130
What? Can't you help?

27:11.163 --> 27:13.199
Me?

27:13.232 --> 27:14.834
Yeah. I can't reach
the zofran.

27:14.867 --> 27:16.936
I don't know, Sam,
what if someone sees us?

27:16.969 --> 27:19.105
They might get
the wrong idea.

27:19.138 --> 27:20.339
Do you have to be
such a dick?

27:20.372 --> 27:22.074
I mean, this porridge
is too hot,

27:22.108 --> 27:24.010
this porridge is too cold...
Porridge?

27:24.043 --> 27:25.311
I don't know how I'm supposed
to act around you anymore.

27:25.344 --> 27:26.312
I gave you a doughnut,

27:26.345 --> 27:27.446
Sam, a doughnut.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.015
Nobody cared.

27:29.048 --> 27:30.983
You're acting like
I got down on my knee

27:31.017 --> 27:32.318
and offered you up a ring.

27:32.351 --> 27:33.385
Here.

27:33.419 --> 27:36.355
Stop being so nutty.

27:36.388 --> 27:38.725
Sam, we need you in here now.

27:39.826 --> 27:42.028
Oh, God, it hurts!
No bleeding.

27:42.061 --> 27:43.830
SAM:
What happened?

27:43.863 --> 27:45.431
I don't know.
She was fine
five minutes ago.

27:45.464 --> 27:47.399
Baby just had
a decel into the 70s.

27:47.433 --> 27:49.736
Baby, you're okay.
You're gonna be okay.
Shut up!

27:49.736 --> 27:52.004
No, it's not,
I'm not okay!

27:52.038 --> 27:53.439
What's going on?!

27:53.472 --> 27:54.741
She never did this
any of the other times.

27:54.741 --> 27:55.908
She's having contractions.

27:55.942 --> 27:57.877
Yeah, I can see that.
Thank you.

27:57.910 --> 27:59.178
You think she's abrupting?
I don't know,
seat belt injury,

27:59.211 --> 28:00.246
precipitous labor,
Seems to fit.

28:00.279 --> 28:01.480
Missy... Missy...

28:01.513 --> 28:03.482
She's hemorrhaging
into the uterus.

28:03.515 --> 28:05.417
Systolic's 66.
LOCKHART:
Okay, Sam, grab some o-neg.

28:05.451 --> 28:07.386
Morris, get the airway box.
We're going up.
Up? Where?

28:07.419 --> 28:09.421
She needs an OR now.
I'll explain to you on the way.

28:09.455 --> 28:11.290
(yelling in pain)

28:11.323 --> 28:12.892
Honey, something's
really wrong...

28:12.925 --> 28:15.995
Keep squeezing the blood.
(clattering)

28:16.028 --> 28:19.766
I want to see the kids.
No, no, no, baby,
you're going to be okay.

28:19.799 --> 28:22.001
What's going on?
Oh, God, I need to push.

28:22.034 --> 28:24.370
No, no, no, wait.
You have to wait.
I can't. I need to push!

28:24.403 --> 28:26.138
Hang on.

28:27.506 --> 28:29.375
Oh, damn.

28:29.408 --> 28:30.810
Everybody out now!
Go! Go! Go!

28:32.178 --> 28:33.479
Hey, we're going back.

28:33.512 --> 28:35.214
We're going to deliver
down here.

28:35.247 --> 28:37.283
That's an arm, Abby.
That's way out of our league.

28:37.316 --> 28:38.985
We have no choice.
There's an increased risk
of cord prolapse...

28:39.018 --> 28:40.419
Push it back in!
Can't you push it back in?!

28:40.452 --> 28:42.288
We're not set up
to do that.

28:42.321 --> 28:44.356
By the time we get her upstairs,
she's going to bleed out.

28:44.390 --> 28:45.491
By the time
we get her back there...
The treatment for abruption

28:45.524 --> 28:46.926
is delivery--
we can do it now,

28:46.959 --> 28:47.860
or wait till both
mom and the baby

28:47.894 --> 28:49.896
are hypoxic or dead.

28:49.929 --> 28:51.197
MORRIS:
Go, go, go.
Okay, people, move
out of the way.

28:51.230 --> 28:52.799
Coming through.

28:57.336 --> 28:58.905
It's rotated at a weird angle.

28:58.938 --> 29:00.406
Where the hell is OB?

29:00.439 --> 29:01.908
Kid's gonna have
a brachial plexus injury.

29:01.941 --> 29:03.042
Systolic's 71.

29:03.075 --> 29:05.044
This is taking too long.

29:05.077 --> 29:06.512
The head's the biggest part.
It's gonna take a little time.

29:06.545 --> 29:08.314
We don't have time.
Heart rate's already under 100.

29:08.347 --> 29:10.249
Forceps?
No.

29:10.282 --> 29:12.018
Vacuum?
No.
Not yet.

29:12.051 --> 29:13.319
I don't know. Uh... uh...

29:13.352 --> 29:14.553
Put her in McRoberts.

29:14.586 --> 29:16.488
What?
Put her legs up.

29:16.522 --> 29:18.524
What's the matter?
Is the baby stuck?

29:18.557 --> 29:21.861
I just need to turn it.
FATHER:
Have you ever done this before?

29:21.894 --> 29:23.162
Call OB again.
We're screwed.

29:23.195 --> 29:24.363
You're not helping.

29:24.396 --> 29:26.032
Is that meconium?
Yes.

29:26.065 --> 29:27.399
Does anyone here know
what they're doing?!

29:27.433 --> 29:29.335
Shut up. Everybody shut up.

29:29.368 --> 29:30.903
Morris, suprapubic pressure.

29:30.937 --> 29:32.204
Sam, get her legs back now.

29:32.238 --> 29:34.040
Brenner, get ready to bag.

29:34.073 --> 29:35.141
And Missy... Missy...

29:35.174 --> 29:36.575
What?
Next contraction

29:36.608 --> 29:37.576
you go.

29:37.609 --> 29:38.845
Okay?
Okay.

29:38.878 --> 29:40.312
Okay.

29:40.346 --> 29:41.848
(screaming)

29:46.118 --> 29:47.419
Right, right.

29:47.453 --> 29:51.023
Down... and through.

29:51.057 --> 29:52.391
Head's out.

29:52.424 --> 29:53.926
That's-a-girl.

29:53.960 --> 29:56.595
All right, bulb suction.

29:56.628 --> 29:58.030
Baby had a presenting arm.

29:58.064 --> 29:59.398
And you delivered
this in the ER?

29:59.431 --> 30:00.967
LOCKHART:
Mom was bleeding out.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.368
The baby was bradycardic.
We had no choice.

30:02.401 --> 30:04.470
You did good.

30:04.503 --> 30:06.906
I told you-- 13th
time's a charm, right?

30:06.939 --> 30:10.076
Anyway, nice job.
Why thank you.

30:12.278 --> 30:14.513
(baby fussing)

30:21.453 --> 30:23.389
Did you hear what we
just did in there?

30:23.422 --> 30:25.124
Or what Abby did, rather.

30:25.157 --> 30:27.326
Got to give credit
where credit's due...

30:27.359 --> 30:29.228
What is
wrong with you?
Excuse me?

30:29.261 --> 30:32.364
Are you a sociopath,
a sadist, stoned?

30:32.398 --> 30:34.300
Because I don't
understand

30:34.333 --> 30:36.168
how anyone can give
a cancer diagnosis

30:36.202 --> 30:37.569
with such a staggering
lack of sensitivity.

30:37.603 --> 30:40.406
I was talking to his nurse,
not the patient.

30:40.439 --> 30:42.008
You were on speaker phone.

30:42.041 --> 30:44.410
And I swear, it was like

30:44.443 --> 30:45.878
you were smiling
when you said it.

30:45.912 --> 30:47.446
I didn't realize that.

30:47.479 --> 30:50.182
And I'm sorry--
but what's done is done.

30:50.216 --> 30:51.951
No, it's not, it's not done.

30:51.984 --> 30:53.419
We will have to live
with what happened here today.

30:53.452 --> 30:55.121
And it makes me sick.

30:55.154 --> 30:56.555
Wow, you know, I heard
that you were tightly wound,

30:56.588 --> 30:58.925
but I had no idea.

30:58.958 --> 31:01.560
Get the hell away,
before I throw that
thing against the wall.

31:06.498 --> 31:08.334
What's the deal with
the chopper run?

31:08.367 --> 31:10.236
We've been suited up in there
for 15 minutes now.

31:10.269 --> 31:11.303
Oh, dispatch called.

31:11.337 --> 31:13.072
There's a wind advisory.

31:13.105 --> 31:15.341
They closed our helipad,
so they sent it to DeKalb.

31:15.374 --> 31:16.943
Where you planning on
telling us that,

31:16.976 --> 31:18.644
or were you just going
to leave us hanging?

31:18.677 --> 31:20.579
Maybe he likes
us in yellow.

31:20.612 --> 31:22.414
Well, your secret's
safe with me.
It better be.

31:22.448 --> 31:23.649
(Brenner whispering)

31:23.682 --> 31:25.451
Okay, I got to work now.
Okay.

31:25.484 --> 31:27.486
Saved the last one
for you.

31:27.519 --> 31:33.059
Frank, you are an
officer and a gentleman.

31:33.092 --> 31:35.661
Thank you.

31:35.694 --> 31:39.198
Lucien.
Skye.

31:39.231 --> 31:42.201
I don't think you should
join me on the dive.

31:42.234 --> 31:44.370
I shouldn't?

31:44.403 --> 31:46.605
You don't want to be on
the boat all day by yourself.

31:46.638 --> 31:48.140
It won't be any fun.

31:48.174 --> 31:50.709
You mean, it wouldn't be
any fun for you.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.711
What?

31:52.744 --> 31:54.713
I might get in the way.

31:54.746 --> 31:57.283
Spoil your playtime
with the boys.

31:57.316 --> 32:00.052
Is that it?

32:00.086 --> 32:03.155
Lucien...
What?

32:03.189 --> 32:05.992
How come I've never
met any of these boys?

32:06.025 --> 32:08.394
You're not really
doing this, are you?

32:08.427 --> 32:09.728
Doing what?

32:09.761 --> 32:12.364
Look.

32:12.398 --> 32:14.066
I've tried to be cool

32:14.100 --> 32:18.070
with your fluidity and,
uh, your independence.

32:18.104 --> 32:20.506
I've scolded myself
for being envious

32:20.539 --> 32:21.507
of your dive buddies,

32:21.540 --> 32:23.075
your climbing club,

32:23.109 --> 32:25.577
your bike team.

32:25.611 --> 32:28.080
You don't need to be jealous.

32:28.114 --> 32:29.515
They're all friends.

32:29.548 --> 32:31.083
I happen to have a
lot of guy friends.

32:31.117 --> 32:32.451
Yeah, you do.

32:32.484 --> 32:34.420
You do. In fact, you
have a pathologic need

32:34.453 --> 32:36.488
to solicit male affection.

32:39.758 --> 32:41.493
Excuse me?
You think,
you think

32:41.527 --> 32:43.429
I don't see the game you're
playing with Brenner? Huh?

32:43.462 --> 32:45.431
Forgive me for being
so slow, Skye.

32:45.464 --> 32:46.565
I'm finally getting it now.

32:46.598 --> 32:47.666
Get what?
That the whole

32:47.699 --> 32:49.201
bohemian-drifter,

32:49.235 --> 32:50.602
love-the-one-
you're-with thing

32:50.636 --> 32:52.204
is nothing but
a bogus justification

32:52.238 --> 32:54.040
to screw anything
that catches your eye.

33:00.646 --> 33:02.148
Well.

33:07.486 --> 33:09.788
Good.

33:09.821 --> 33:12.691
Good. You finally
figured me out,

33:12.724 --> 33:15.261
and you're
absolutely right.

33:15.294 --> 33:18.630
I've done everybody--

33:18.664 --> 33:20.332
Pratt... Morris...

33:20.366 --> 33:22.401
Gates...

33:22.434 --> 33:23.635
security guards,

33:23.669 --> 33:25.071
Mel the roach coach guy--

33:25.104 --> 33:26.572
and I'm having
a damn good time

33:26.605 --> 33:28.240
with Simon Brenner.

33:28.274 --> 33:31.310
We've worn the varnish
right off my desk.

33:31.343 --> 33:33.412
You know, it's too bad.

33:33.445 --> 33:36.082
It really is.

33:36.115 --> 33:38.550
I was starting to let
my guard down with you.

33:40.486 --> 33:43.289
Bought this to keep
you company on my dive.

33:43.322 --> 33:44.623
Skye...
Gotta run.

33:44.656 --> 33:46.158
Scheduled a quickie
with Frank.

33:46.192 --> 33:47.559
Wait.

33:57.469 --> 33:58.570
I thought you left.

33:58.604 --> 34:00.506
I was working on a project,

34:00.539 --> 34:02.508
but, um, I really
wanted to tell you...

34:02.541 --> 34:05.111
Yeah. You know, what?
I'm really not in the mood

34:05.111 --> 34:06.412
for your righteous disapproval

34:06.445 --> 34:07.846
right now, okay?
Abby...

34:07.879 --> 34:09.481
And I know, I'm
supposed to take it.

34:09.514 --> 34:10.849
I know, but not tonight.

34:10.882 --> 34:12.451
And tomorrow, I
promise I will bend over.

34:12.484 --> 34:14.420
Abby, stop.

34:15.654 --> 34:17.489
Good job today.

34:17.523 --> 34:19.324
That's all I wanted to say.

34:24.130 --> 34:27.733
All right, look, I know
I've been judgmental.

34:27.766 --> 34:29.368
It's just that I
grew up surrounded

34:29.400 --> 34:32.871
by people with
problems, big problems,

34:32.904 --> 34:34.873
and I watched them dig
themselves into a hole

34:34.906 --> 34:37.275
and not really try
to get out of it.

34:37.309 --> 34:38.409
And maybe
that's not you.

34:38.444 --> 34:39.878
I hope it isn't.

34:39.911 --> 34:42.648
I'm working really hard
for that not to be me.

34:47.753 --> 34:49.188
I know.

34:52.158 --> 34:56.594
Sometimes it's hard for me
to be real rah-rah about it.

35:01.933 --> 35:04.170
I hate rah-rah.

35:11.343 --> 35:12.878
All right. Well.

35:13.912 --> 35:15.314
Good night.

35:25.691 --> 35:28.194
Oh. Dr. Anspaugh.

35:28.194 --> 35:30.229
Hi, Abby.

35:30.262 --> 35:31.897
Hi.

35:31.930 --> 35:34.300
Um...

35:34.333 --> 35:35.801
I know I postponed
my interview today,

35:35.834 --> 35:37.303
but that was a mistake.

35:37.336 --> 35:38.604
I, I don't know
why I thought

35:38.637 --> 35:41.273
I should wait,
because I shouldn't.

35:41.307 --> 35:42.874
I want to be
an attending here

35:42.908 --> 35:44.943
and I think I would
be a good one, so

35:44.976 --> 35:46.812
I was wondering if maybe
you could squeeze me in

35:46.845 --> 35:48.280
like tomorrow or
the next day or...

35:48.314 --> 35:50.216
I have a few minutes right now.

35:50.216 --> 35:51.917
Come on in.

35:53.619 --> 35:55.321
Honey, listen, a "B" in History

35:55.354 --> 35:57.656
does not ruin your chances
of being appointed

35:57.689 --> 35:59.291
to the Supreme Court.

35:59.325 --> 36:01.260
Listen, my doctor's here.

36:01.293 --> 36:02.494
I gotta go, okay, honey?

36:02.528 --> 36:03.629
Okay, I'll call
you later.

36:03.662 --> 36:06.232
I love you.

36:06.265 --> 36:09.635
My son Tommy is
so hard on himself.

36:09.668 --> 36:11.537
I mean, it's sad.

36:11.570 --> 36:13.839
When I was 15,
my greatest ambition

36:13.872 --> 36:15.974
was to date a boy with a car.

36:16.007 --> 36:18.677
Sheryl...

36:19.578 --> 36:20.812
Uh-oh. What?

36:23.549 --> 36:27.253
I don't know how to tell
you this, so I'll just, uh...

36:30.822 --> 36:34.593
You've developed
a post-operative infection.

36:34.626 --> 36:35.894
Well, I, I knew that.

36:35.927 --> 36:37.763
That, that's why I'm
on the antibiotics now.

36:37.796 --> 36:40.866
Right. But now the aortic
graft is involved,

36:40.899 --> 36:42.968
and tomorrow we're
gonna have to do

36:43.001 --> 36:47.373
a surgery to clean it out.

36:47.406 --> 36:50.809
Hopefully, that will
be it, but...

36:53.011 --> 36:54.613
Dr. Dubenko was gonna

36:54.646 --> 36:55.981
tell you hours ago,

36:56.014 --> 37:00.852
but I felt I should do it,

37:00.886 --> 37:04.290
and then I couldn't.

37:04.290 --> 37:07.559
All day long, I've avoided
this room. I'm sorry.

37:08.860 --> 37:10.862
Don't worry.

37:10.896 --> 37:13.699
It's not like I have
big plans for the morning.

37:16.902 --> 37:21.807
You know, I've given hundreds
of patients bad news.

37:21.840 --> 37:25.344
I don't know
why I'm being so crazy.

37:25.377 --> 37:27.613
I don't know why
I couldn't tell you.

37:27.646 --> 37:31.350
It's because we've
become friends.

37:31.383 --> 37:32.751
It's sweet.

37:32.784 --> 37:35.621
And damn it, I... (sniffs)

37:35.654 --> 37:38.557
I don't know
why you got infected.

37:40.692 --> 37:45.964
Just...

37:45.997 --> 37:47.799
Just bad luck, you know.

37:47.833 --> 37:49.768
Some, something
that statistically...

37:49.801 --> 37:51.737
It's okay, Neela.

37:51.770 --> 37:52.738
Don't cry.

37:52.771 --> 37:53.772
Don't.

37:55.541 --> 37:58.477
Yeah, but you've been,
you've been doing so well.

37:58.510 --> 37:59.745
So--

37:59.778 --> 38:01.813
you go back in tomorrow,

38:01.847 --> 38:03.415
you do what you have to do.

38:03.449 --> 38:06.352
I survived a ruptured
aorta, right?

38:06.385 --> 38:10.055
I mean, not such a
big thing after that.

38:14.460 --> 38:16.995
I'm gonna have
the same surgeon, right?

38:18.530 --> 38:20.899
Definitely.

38:20.932 --> 38:23.569
Then I'm gonna be fine.

38:25.704 --> 38:28.774
I'm gonna be just fine.

38:56.902 --> 39:00.005
*

39:30.035 --> 39:33.138
*

40:03.068 --> 40:06.171
*

40:39.004 --> 40:43.008
*

41:13.071 --> 41:16.174
*

41:43.602 --> 41:45.003
Hey.
Hi.

41:49.107 --> 41:50.075
How'd it go?

41:50.108 --> 41:51.076
Good. Good.

41:51.109 --> 41:52.210
I took the job.

41:55.747 --> 41:57.015
You did?

42:06.224 --> 42:10.061
You don't know how badly
I want to tell you I'm fine,

42:10.095 --> 42:12.898
that we can work
everything through,

42:12.931 --> 42:14.232
and find a way to fix it.

42:14.265 --> 42:15.767
Luka, you know,
you don't need to...

42:15.801 --> 42:16.868
Or that I could

42:16.902 --> 42:21.907
forget and go on,

42:21.940 --> 42:24.109
but too much has happened.

42:30.616 --> 42:32.017
I have to move out.
