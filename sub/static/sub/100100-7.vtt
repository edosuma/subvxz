WEBVTT

00:05.309 --> 00:09.270
Dazzle me. A perfect match
for Dean Deveraux.

00:09.313 --> 00:11.837
Wouldn't you agree,
Mr. Deveraux?

00:11.881 --> 00:14.623
Catherine Hamilton's
investigators found

00:14.666 --> 00:16.929
Skull fragments
of a little girl.

00:16.973 --> 00:18.235
It's Beth.

00:18.279 --> 00:19.758
You never would have
moved on

00:19.802 --> 00:21.978
If you didn't think that
Beth were dead.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.502
I paid the dna analyst
to write the report.

00:24.546 --> 00:28.637
Get away from me.
just get away from me.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.204
If I wanted
to kill you,

00:30.247 --> 00:32.423
I would have to wait for you
to be wearing the suit.

00:32.467 --> 00:37.950
Your concern for me is
so touching, dear sister.

00:37.994 --> 00:40.779
So Kate is Batwoman.

00:42.738 --> 00:44.783
-Is this you?
-Wasn't me.

00:44.827 --> 00:46.437
Tyler,
this is Kate.

00:46.481 --> 00:47.960
You're married.

00:49.266 --> 00:51.660
I don't know
how you did it, Bruce.

00:51.703 --> 00:54.663
You spent night after night
in these same shadows,

00:54.706 --> 00:57.796
Prowling, hunting, hiding,

00:57.840 --> 01:01.931
And you did it in secret
all alone.

01:38.185 --> 01:39.882
Everyone all right?

01:52.416 --> 01:54.375
Bravo team,
check in Alessandro's.

01:54.418 --> 01:56.159
I'll circle around back.

01:56.203 --> 01:57.900
You heard her.
move out.

02:01.208 --> 02:03.384
Did it ever
get to you, Bruce,

02:03.427 --> 02:04.994
The loneliness?

02:05.037 --> 02:07.388
Did you ever let yourself
trust anyone?

02:07.431 --> 02:08.737
Kate!

02:08.780 --> 02:09.999
How'd that work out
for you?

02:11.218 --> 02:13.394
Sorry to disappoint.

02:13.437 --> 02:17.746
Your dad ordered
the Crows to stop you
at any cost.

02:17.789 --> 02:19.530
He needs to know
you're his daughter.

02:19.574 --> 02:21.010
You have the wrong girl.

02:21.053 --> 02:22.664
Kate, I'm serious.

02:22.707 --> 02:24.187
You're in danger,

02:24.231 --> 02:26.189
And if you won't
tell him, I will.

02:26.233 --> 02:28.322
-Do you trust me?
-What?

02:28.365 --> 02:30.280
I'll find you.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.285
Shooter escaped.

02:35.329 --> 02:37.374
Was that Batwoman?

02:37.418 --> 02:39.028
She say anything
to you?

02:39.071 --> 02:41.900
No. she just took off.

02:48.255 --> 02:51.345
Tuxedo one here.

02:51.388 --> 02:53.216
I was right.

02:53.260 --> 02:56.132
The Rifle's made
his way to Gotham.

03:01.442 --> 03:03.444
The third time
is not the charm

03:03.487 --> 03:06.403
For Gotham's prolific
shadow shooter.

03:06.447 --> 03:08.492
After killing two people
this week,

03:08.536 --> 03:11.147
Sources say Batwoman
thwarted his attack

03:11.191 --> 03:13.367
At Alessandro's last night,
which means

03:13.410 --> 03:15.238
I'm not the only one
who thinks they have

03:15.282 --> 03:17.066
They have best ossobuco
in the city.

03:17.109 --> 03:21.810
Without the city's hero,
our doors would be shuttered.

03:21.853 --> 03:24.073
Batwoman, if you see this,

03:24.116 --> 03:25.509
You are welcome
for a free meal

03:25.553 --> 03:29.209
At Alessandro's
anytime, anytime.

03:34.431 --> 03:36.259
Hey.

03:41.656 --> 03:45.442
Just read this news blurb
your dad filed for divorce.

03:45.486 --> 03:46.617
Yep.

03:46.661 --> 03:49.229
Are you ok?

03:51.318 --> 03:54.190
He married a woman
who preyed on his grief

03:54.234 --> 03:56.105
And convinced him
that I was crazy

03:56.148 --> 03:57.715
For thinking Beth
was still alive.

03:57.759 --> 04:00.196
Unh! I can't say I'm
losing any sleep over it.

04:00.240 --> 04:04.983
If it means anything,
i didn't sleep last night either.

04:05.027 --> 04:06.855
"why, Luke? what was
on your mind?"

04:06.898 --> 04:08.291
Oh. thanks for asking.

04:08.335 --> 04:10.075
I was up analyzing
the list of everyone

04:10.119 --> 04:11.686
Who was at Alessandro's
for dinner.

04:11.729 --> 04:13.862
"Hey. cool. way to take
the initiative on that!

04:13.905 --> 04:15.472
Find anything?"

04:15.516 --> 04:17.474
I did, in fact.
Last two victims of the sniper

04:17.517 --> 04:20.216
Both worked for your future
ex-stepmother's companies.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.738
Now one of Alessandro's
dinner guests--

04:21.783 --> 04:24.525
Mr. Holcomb--works
for pyra electrics.

04:24.568 --> 04:26.570
They make all of Hamilton Dynamics'
conductors,

04:26.614 --> 04:28.920
which following
the pattern--

04:28.964 --> 04:30.879
Makes him the target.

04:30.922 --> 04:32.402
I need to find him.

04:32.446 --> 04:33.925
I agree,
but I haven't quite found

04:33.969 --> 04:35.318
A home address.

04:35.362 --> 04:37.668
Then find it.

04:37.712 --> 04:41.324
Urgency's good. You're being
very urgent, though.

04:41.368 --> 04:43.500
-Sophie knows who I am.
-Sight.

04:43.544 --> 04:45.546
-thought Sophie was cool.
-you're not getting it.

04:45.589 --> 04:47.330
She's threatening
to tell my dad.

04:47.374 --> 04:49.419
He's gonna freak out
and shut us down.

04:49.463 --> 04:51.813
Means no more
protecting people,

04:51.856 --> 04:53.815
No more helping
the city,

04:53.858 --> 04:55.469
No more Batwoman.

04:55.512 --> 04:57.427
Can you trust her?

05:11.398 --> 05:14.139
I used to trust her

05:14.183 --> 05:16.707
With everything.

05:16.751 --> 05:19.580
Then just be real
with her,

05:19.623 --> 05:21.930
And for the sake
of the city,

05:21.973 --> 05:24.062
Convince the hell
out of her

05:24.106 --> 05:26.021
Not to tell your dad
who you are.

05:36.423 --> 05:38.512
-Hey.
-Hey.

05:38.555 --> 05:40.383
-Have you seen him?
-Kane?

05:40.427 --> 05:43.168
Heard he went
upstate. Why?

05:43.212 --> 05:45.083
I need to talk to him
about something.

05:45.127 --> 05:46.955
Well, I'm sure he
brought his phone.

05:46.998 --> 05:49.610
Kind of an in-person thing.

05:49.653 --> 05:51.220
Is it kind of
a husband thing?

05:51.263 --> 05:53.570
Because now I'm
supercurious.

05:53.614 --> 05:56.356
I promise you'll be
the second person to know.

06:03.798 --> 06:05.408
I thought you said
Batwoman took off

06:05.452 --> 06:07.062
Before you could
talk to her.

06:07.105 --> 06:09.238
She did. why?

06:18.160 --> 06:20.771
Are you working
with her?

06:20.815 --> 06:22.512
Am I working
with her?

06:22.556 --> 06:24.296
I mean, look how
close you two are.

06:24.340 --> 06:25.776
I commanded she surrender.

06:25.820 --> 06:28.431
You're acting like
we exchanged brownie recipes.

06:28.475 --> 06:32.087
Sophie, do you know
who she is?

06:32.130 --> 06:34.437
No.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.744
Tyler, I don't.

06:38.833 --> 06:40.487
Ok.

06:46.928 --> 06:49.060
So now dad's
not even showing up

06:49.104 --> 06:50.888
To the divorce
proceedings?

06:50.932 --> 06:54.370
The lawyer said
he's upstate.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.677
He bailed,
Kate bailed.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.461
If I knew it was
attendance optional,

06:58.505 --> 07:03.031
I would have literally
been anywhere else.

07:03.074 --> 07:04.511
Are we gonna talk
about this

07:04.554 --> 07:07.514
Or just act like everything
isn't about to change?

07:07.557 --> 07:09.820
Not everything
has to change.

07:09.864 --> 07:11.909
We still have the penthouse.
you can still go to school.

07:11.953 --> 07:13.694
I'm losing my sister.

07:13.737 --> 07:16.479
Kate and I have finally started
to have a connection

07:16.523 --> 07:20.135
After 5 years, and now she
hates me because of you.

07:21.702 --> 07:24.313
When you are a mother,
you'll understand

07:24.356 --> 07:26.707
Why I did what I did.

07:26.750 --> 07:28.839
What am I supposed
to do until then?

07:28.883 --> 07:31.059
You're the only family
i have left,

07:31.102 --> 07:33.365
And I don't even want to be
in this car with you right now.

07:33.409 --> 07:35.280
Mary, I have enough
going on right now

07:35.324 --> 07:36.804
Without another
guilt trip.

07:38.719 --> 07:40.547
Your text doesn't
make sense.

07:40.590 --> 07:43.201
A coil accelerator doesn't
just go missing.

07:43.245 --> 07:47.336
It's under level 5
security protocol.

07:47.379 --> 07:48.946
Then get me Dean Deveraux.

07:48.990 --> 07:52.515
He created the gun. he'll know
exactly what's going on.

07:55.475 --> 07:58.086
Oh, my god.

07:58.129 --> 07:59.914
Killed by whom?

08:02.612 --> 08:04.005
Derek Holcomb
just swiped his badge

08:04.048 --> 08:06.311
At the Hamilton Dynamics exit
two minutes ago.

08:06.355 --> 08:08.749
We need to get him
before the shooter does.

08:08.792 --> 08:10.359
I see him.

08:10.402 --> 08:11.795
Leads-up.
second heat signature

08:11.839 --> 08:13.449
30 feet to the west.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.103
I see him,
too.

08:15.146 --> 08:16.539
Uh, batcave to Batwoman.
There's--

08:16.583 --> 08:19.324
Let me guess.
a third heat signature?

08:34.644 --> 08:36.385
Not another step,
Batwoman.

08:36.428 --> 08:38.386
I'll be bringing
him in.

08:51.008 --> 08:53.271
Good news--
Derek Holcomb got away.

08:53.315 --> 08:55.447
Bad news--
so did the shooter.

08:58.973 --> 09:01.715
Ha ha ha! ha ha!

09:01.758 --> 09:04.065
Kate Kane.

09:04.108 --> 09:06.720
What? I'd recognize that hammer
strike anywhere.

09:06.763 --> 09:09.070
After all,
i taught it to you.

09:09.113 --> 09:10.637
Julia Pennyworth.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.639
Figured Alfred would have taught
you better manners.

09:12.682 --> 09:14.597
Let's leave my father
out of this.

09:14.641 --> 09:16.294
Who was that assassin,

09:16.338 --> 09:18.732
And what the hell are you
doing in my city?

09:46.498 --> 09:49.850
Good job, sweet Mouse,

09:49.893 --> 09:55.464
And that is how you kill
someone the first time.

09:55.507 --> 09:57.553
I killed two men
for you.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.774
Of the...3 I requested.

10:00.817 --> 10:02.689
If I walked around failing
at a 1/3 of everything

10:02.732 --> 10:04.647
I did, I'd still be
locked in a cell

10:04.691 --> 10:06.867
On a diet
of my own fingernails.

10:06.910 --> 10:09.304
Mouse, can you tell
our friend here

10:09.347 --> 10:12.307
Why we hired him to kill
those scientists?

10:12.350 --> 10:16.137
Because they were the only
people on the planet

10:16.180 --> 10:19.749
Who knew how to make
that gun.

10:19.793 --> 10:23.448
Hmm. which makes this
one of a kind.

10:23.492 --> 10:25.276
See, I did your boss
a favor.

10:25.320 --> 10:28.889
Now no one
can re-create it.

10:28.932 --> 10:32.240
Time to hand over what she
promised me in return.

10:32.283 --> 10:34.024
Easy, blondie.

10:34.068 --> 10:36.070
Where is it?

10:36.113 --> 10:37.593
She's not giving you
anything

10:37.637 --> 10:39.508
Until she finds out
that works.

10:43.947 --> 10:46.341
Hmm.

10:46.384 --> 10:48.386
Send her a selfie

10:48.430 --> 10:51.651
And give me a call when you
have what I'm owed.

10:57.918 --> 10:59.571
So who does
he work for?

10:59.615 --> 11:02.705
The Rifle?
Anyone and everyone.

11:02.749 --> 11:04.707
That's what makes
him slippery.

11:04.751 --> 11:07.884
My agency assigned me
to him 8 months ago.

11:07.928 --> 11:10.713
Ha ha!
you kept Dino.

11:10.757 --> 11:13.368
Bruce would be
so happy.

11:13.411 --> 11:15.283
So how'd The Rifle
end up here?

11:15.326 --> 11:16.893
Well, I lost sight
of him in jakarta,

11:16.937 --> 11:18.286
Picked up his scent
in Metropolis,

11:18.329 --> 11:19.591
And then I
followed a tip

11:19.635 --> 11:20.897
That he got a job
in Gotham.

11:20.941 --> 11:22.899
Whenever The Rifle
shows up, he leaves

11:22.943 --> 11:24.640
Death and destruction
in his wake.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.381
I know the type.

11:27.774 --> 11:31.125
Good for you, following
in your cousin's footsteps.

11:31.168 --> 11:34.128
Bruce is apparently better
at keeping a secret than I am.

11:34.171 --> 11:36.783
To be fair, I did
teach you that move

11:36.826 --> 11:39.960
And a few others
if I recall.

11:40.003 --> 11:41.570
Holy crap!

11:41.613 --> 11:42.745
Don't worry. she's--

11:42.789 --> 11:45.008
-Julia?
-Luke Fox.

11:46.967 --> 11:49.230
-What are you doing here?
-Business,

11:49.273 --> 11:51.014
Glimpses of pleasure.

11:51.058 --> 11:52.537
How you doing, love?

11:52.581 --> 11:53.974
You know, holding
down the fort.

11:54.017 --> 11:55.932
Of course you are.
chip off the old block.

11:55.976 --> 11:58.195
I was just gonna suggest to Kate
that we all team up

11:58.239 --> 11:59.588
And nab this
sniping bastard.

11:59.631 --> 12:00.850
What do you say?

12:00.894 --> 12:02.156
Not happening
unless you forgot

12:02.199 --> 12:04.332
The last time
we teamed up.

12:04.375 --> 12:05.768
I'm missing something.

12:05.812 --> 12:07.117
Kate's still sore
at me for a little

12:07.161 --> 12:08.945
White lie I told
in the british isles.

12:08.989 --> 12:10.947
When I first met Julia,
she was pretending

12:10.991 --> 12:12.819
To be a krav maga
teacher.

12:12.862 --> 12:14.908
She'd just been naughtily expelled
from military school,

12:14.951 --> 12:16.910
Sent off to train with strangers
around the world,

12:16.953 --> 12:18.912
And Bruce asked me to check up
on his favorite cousin

12:18.955 --> 12:20.957
Without making it seem like
i was babysitting.

12:21.001 --> 12:23.220
So you lied and pretended
that you had a thing for me.

12:23.264 --> 12:28.008
Love, the only thing I lied about
was why I was there.

12:28.051 --> 12:30.837
Oh. so you two know each other.
Know each other.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.055
Well, I was only trying
to help you

12:32.099 --> 12:34.144
Move on from--
what was her name--

12:34.188 --> 12:35.406
Sophie something.

12:35.450 --> 12:36.799
Yeah. that didn't work.

12:36.843 --> 12:38.192
I'm sorry.
who asked you?

12:38.235 --> 12:39.584
Oh. we still not
over her then?

12:39.628 --> 12:40.847
She's married...

12:40.890 --> 12:42.022
To a man.

12:42.065 --> 12:43.588
We're done talking
about this.

12:43.632 --> 12:44.807
She is hell-bent
on telling my dad

12:44.851 --> 12:46.504
That I'm Batwoman,
and I need to

12:46.548 --> 12:47.679
Convince her not to.

12:47.723 --> 12:48.942
How can I help?

12:48.985 --> 12:50.813
Find The Rifle guy

12:50.857 --> 12:52.641
And stay the hell
out of my business.

12:52.684 --> 12:54.904
"I hereby deny
the allegation

12:54.948 --> 12:56.601
"of homosexual conduct.

12:56.645 --> 12:58.429
"signing the above denial
will drop

12:58.473 --> 13:00.040
"all disciplinary action

13:00.083 --> 13:01.824
"and permit
the cadet in question

13:01.868 --> 13:04.261
To reengage with all
academic activity."

13:04.305 --> 13:07.090
-Damn it.
-It's gonna be ok.

13:07.134 --> 13:09.832
For you. Your dad
doesn't dry heave

13:09.876 --> 13:12.008
When he sees
a rainbow flag.

13:12.052 --> 13:15.185
My mom calls gays
degenerate sinners.

13:15.229 --> 13:16.665
We should tell
the truth.

13:16.708 --> 13:18.058
They'll kick us out.

13:18.101 --> 13:20.930
We'll never make it
into the army.

13:20.974 --> 13:23.846
If we lie, why are
we even here?

13:23.890 --> 13:25.456
Besides, they're not gonna
kick out the academy's

13:25.500 --> 13:28.416
Top two cadets a week
before graduation.

13:28.459 --> 13:29.896
What if you're wrong?

13:29.939 --> 13:31.680
Sophie...

13:36.293 --> 13:37.860
Look at everything
we've done

13:37.904 --> 13:39.035
Over the past 4 years.

13:39.079 --> 13:41.037
First off, we're women
at point rock.

13:41.081 --> 13:44.301
Sophie freaking Moore broke
Sean Azadi's obstacle record

13:44.345 --> 13:46.042
By one second.

13:46.086 --> 13:47.914
You did make the
sharpshooter competition

13:47.957 --> 13:49.219
Your bitch.

13:49.263 --> 13:51.439
And we did it all together,

13:51.482 --> 13:53.484
And we'll get
through this together

13:53.528 --> 13:56.009
As long as we stay
united.

13:56.052 --> 13:58.228
You're right.
they're not gonna expel

13:58.272 --> 14:00.013
Sophie freaking Moore.

14:00.056 --> 14:02.667
Let's do it. Let's tell
them the truth.

14:02.711 --> 14:04.974
We're telling them
the truth.

14:12.025 --> 14:14.679
I need to run
a quick errand.

14:14.723 --> 14:16.159
-Is it her?
-Who?

14:16.203 --> 14:17.726
-Batwoman.
-no.

14:17.769 --> 14:19.249
And keep your voice down.

14:19.293 --> 14:20.816
So it is her.

14:20.860 --> 14:24.907
Look. I'll tell you
everything when I get back.

14:24.951 --> 14:27.083
-I promise.
-Soph.

14:42.011 --> 14:46.842
Hey. Thanks
for meeting with me.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.670
Interesting choice.

14:53.980 --> 14:58.071
Wine, candlelight,
your favorite kicks.

14:58.114 --> 15:00.160
If I didn't know better,
I'd think

15:00.203 --> 15:02.205
You were about to propose.

15:02.249 --> 15:04.816
Very funny.

15:04.860 --> 15:08.995
So why am I here, Kate?

15:09.038 --> 15:10.779
Before I say anything,
I need to know

15:10.822 --> 15:12.302
I can trust you.

15:14.043 --> 15:17.003
I can't promise you something
when I don't know what it is.

15:17.046 --> 15:19.744
Yeah. I...

15:19.788 --> 15:22.008
I need you to...

15:24.619 --> 15:27.970
Ok. you can trust me.

15:28.014 --> 15:30.146
So. I should start
by saying

15:30.190 --> 15:31.974
I'm the last person
i ever imagined

15:32.018 --> 15:34.150
Would be
in this position.

15:34.194 --> 15:38.198
Pardon the interruption,
ladies.

15:38.241 --> 15:40.765
Unfortunately, sneakers
are not allowed

15:40.809 --> 15:43.159
In the dining area.

15:43.203 --> 15:45.161
I'm surprised that you
could see them

15:45.205 --> 15:47.990
Considering they're hiding
underneath our table.

15:48.034 --> 15:50.166
Dress codes
are dress codes.

15:50.210 --> 15:54.605
Right. that guy right there is
wearing sneakers.

15:54.649 --> 15:56.607
Maybe you would enjoy
instead

15:56.651 --> 15:59.654
Our lounge outside.

15:59.697 --> 16:02.004
Thank you, but we're
really good here.

16:02.048 --> 16:06.356
Sophie, my love, what would you
like to eat?

16:06.400 --> 16:08.184
Kate.

16:08.228 --> 16:12.232
Signora...
Let's avoid a scene.

16:12.275 --> 16:14.190
Then admit that the only thing
offensive

16:14.234 --> 16:17.237
About my shoes is me.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.021
Kate, chill.

16:19.065 --> 16:21.067
Please tell me you get what's
happening right now.

16:23.983 --> 16:28.596
Miss...i need to
ask you to leave.

16:28.639 --> 16:32.861
Oh. then I need to call my
stepsister Mary Hamilton.

16:32.904 --> 16:34.819
Do you know her?
because she knows you

16:34.863 --> 16:36.734
And 3.5 million
other people.

16:36.778 --> 16:38.388
Uh, yeah. one snap
from her,

16:38.432 --> 16:40.173
And she will shut
this place down

16:40.216 --> 16:42.044
Faster than you
can say,

16:42.088 --> 16:43.828
"gay people make me
feel uncomfortable!"

16:52.141 --> 16:53.708
Enjoy your meal.

16:53.751 --> 16:56.928
Yeah. Thanks, but we're not
hungry anymore.

17:00.236 --> 17:02.064
Was that necessary?

17:02.108 --> 17:03.544
Standing up
for myself? yeah.

17:03.587 --> 17:05.849
That's what it looks like when it
comes out naturally.

17:05.894 --> 17:07.461
Don't even go there,
Kate.

17:07.503 --> 17:09.289
I have no intention
of going there.

17:09.332 --> 17:11.073
There is some sad
and lonely closet

17:11.117 --> 17:12.727
That I want nothing
to do with.

17:12.770 --> 17:15.295
What went down at point rock
was the worst day of my life.

17:15.338 --> 17:16.992
Worse than having
the love of your life

17:17.036 --> 17:18.253
Lie straight
to your face?

17:18.298 --> 17:19.951
I wasn't planning
to lie to you.

17:19.994 --> 17:21.431
Is that supposed to
make me feel better?

17:21.474 --> 17:23.477
I was going to do
everything we talked about,

17:23.520 --> 17:26.088
Tell the truth, throw the letter
in their face,

17:26.132 --> 17:27.220
Stand my ground.

17:27.262 --> 17:28.438
So what happened?

17:28.482 --> 17:30.136
I got a second opinion.

17:39.145 --> 17:43.366
So...this day sucks.

17:43.410 --> 17:46.891
Mr. Kane, hi.

17:46.935 --> 17:50.112
Your mom coming
for the hearing?

17:50.156 --> 17:52.288
I asked them
not to call her.

17:52.332 --> 17:55.770
-She has no idea.
-Hmm.

17:55.813 --> 17:58.338
I love your
daughter, sir.

17:58.381 --> 18:02.472
Kate and I are gonna
stick together on this.

18:02.516 --> 18:06.302
They can't kick out
their top two cadets.

18:06.346 --> 18:12.613
Well...Moore, you should do
whatever you think you need to do.

18:12.656 --> 18:15.964
But?

18:16.007 --> 18:17.922
But if you think you're
gonna walk out of there

18:17.966 --> 18:19.924
Without signing
that letter of denial

18:19.968 --> 18:24.842
And still graduate,
you are in for a major disappointment.

18:26.757 --> 18:29.195
Did you say that
to Kate?

18:29.238 --> 18:34.200
Kate is fearless,
passionate, and reckless.

18:34.243 --> 18:36.506
She is gonna walk
into that hearing

18:36.550 --> 18:37.942
And burn
the house down.

18:37.986 --> 18:40.031
Nothing I say can convince
her otherwise.

18:40.075 --> 18:42.382
That's what I love
about her,

18:42.425 --> 18:46.212
But this will be
her last day at point rock.

18:48.214 --> 18:51.739
What about
the bad press?

18:51.782 --> 18:56.222
This school is built on history,
tradition, and code.

18:56.265 --> 18:58.093
They'll point
to the rules,

18:58.137 --> 19:00.008
Say you broke them,

19:00.051 --> 19:02.402
Forget you ever existed.

19:04.230 --> 19:06.188
If I don't tell
the truth,

19:06.232 --> 19:08.408
It will destroy
our relationship.

19:08.451 --> 19:11.237
I can't make
this decision for you...

19:13.239 --> 19:16.938
And I am sorry you
have to make it at all.

19:27.340 --> 19:30.299
You looked me straight in the eye
and told me you didn't love me.

19:30.343 --> 19:32.214
I thought it would
be cleaner than--

19:32.258 --> 19:35.565
Than telling me that
my dad convinced you to lie?

19:35.609 --> 19:37.828
He didn't tell me to lie.

19:37.872 --> 19:41.092
He opened my eyes
to reality.

19:41.136 --> 19:43.921
I was going to get
expelled,

19:43.965 --> 19:46.489
And thanks to him,
i ended up serving,

19:46.533 --> 19:50.580
I graduated, I made money
for my family.

19:50.624 --> 19:52.452
I got handpicked
by your dad

19:52.495 --> 19:54.280
To help lead the Crows.

19:54.323 --> 19:56.238
You credit your entire career
to my dad?

19:56.282 --> 19:58.066
I credit him for
stopping me from losing

19:58.109 --> 20:00.808
Everything I worked for.

20:00.851 --> 20:03.376
And instead,
you just lost me.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.824
How long?

20:16.867 --> 20:20.044
The details
don't matter.

20:20.088 --> 20:22.482
I'm here thinking you have a bead
on Batwoman's identity,

20:22.525 --> 20:24.397
And you sit me down and tell me that
dating a chick

20:24.440 --> 20:26.921
Almost got you expelled
from military academy.

20:26.964 --> 20:29.706
I'm owed
some details, Soph.

20:29.750 --> 20:32.100
We met sophomore year.

20:32.143 --> 20:33.884
Our dorm rooms were
in the same building.

20:33.928 --> 20:36.452
So 3 years.

20:36.496 --> 20:37.845
Give or take.

20:37.888 --> 20:39.368
Give or take?

20:39.412 --> 20:41.457
Just to be clear,
3 years is longer

20:41.501 --> 20:44.112
Than any relationship
I've had outside of you.

20:44.155 --> 20:47.115
I'm not saying
it's insignificant.

20:53.904 --> 20:56.646
Then why didn't you
tell me?

20:56.690 --> 20:58.431
You've met my mom.

20:58.474 --> 21:02.173
Heh. yeah.
does she know?

21:02.217 --> 21:04.524
Of course not,

21:04.567 --> 21:07.222
But that's what
I'm saying.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.311
I didn't tell anyone.

21:09.355 --> 21:12.009
I just wanted it
to go away.

21:12.053 --> 21:14.011
Has it?

21:14.055 --> 21:17.014
Tyler, you are
my husband. I love you.

21:17.058 --> 21:19.408
Has your thing
with Kate gone away?

21:25.284 --> 21:27.024
Got it, Soph.

21:33.814 --> 21:35.729
So the guy just burst
through the door

21:35.772 --> 21:37.208
At the noodle house,
yelling,

21:37.252 --> 21:38.514
"Pennyworth,
you're mine!"

21:38.558 --> 21:40.386
So that's how Kate found
out who you really were?

21:40.429 --> 21:42.170
Well, yeah. once I knocked the guy
on his ass,

21:42.213 --> 21:43.911
I couldn't really go
back to my egg drop soup

21:43.954 --> 21:45.391
Without explaining.

21:45.434 --> 21:46.740
Kate's bags were packed,
and she was gone

21:46.783 --> 21:48.481
By the end of the day.

21:48.524 --> 21:50.570
Story time.
You must have a 20 on The Rifle.

21:50.613 --> 21:52.572
Sad news actually.
we found Derek Holcomb.

21:52.615 --> 21:54.269
Despite dodging
death twice,

21:54.313 --> 21:56.532
poor bloke was found knifed to death
in an alley.

21:56.576 --> 21:58.534
Not exactly
The Rifle's m.o.

21:58.578 --> 21:59.796
So the trail's
gone cold?

21:59.840 --> 22:01.276
For now.

22:03.452 --> 22:06.368
So how'd Sophie
take it?

22:06.412 --> 22:10.372
She didn't.
i didn't tell her.

22:10.416 --> 22:12.722
You're a few sandwiches
short of a picnic, love.

22:12.766 --> 22:14.637
She's gonna tell
your dad.

22:14.681 --> 22:16.204
She would anyway.

22:16.247 --> 22:17.466
There's no way Sophie
will ever be

22:17.510 --> 22:19.076
Anything but loyal
to him.

22:19.120 --> 22:22.166
So how do we keep
him from shutting us down?

22:22.210 --> 22:23.951
We move to plan "C."

22:23.994 --> 22:25.387
Which is?

22:25.431 --> 22:27.258
A little bit crazy.

22:33.526 --> 22:35.832
Oh, my god.
you have a safe room?!

22:35.876 --> 22:38.444
-um, Mary.
-how did you get past security?

22:38.487 --> 22:41.403
Carl at he front desk loves
double-whipped frappuccinos.

22:41.447 --> 22:43.753
Good. he'll be
making them soon.

22:43.797 --> 22:49.455
Anyway, can we confab about the
implosion of our family?

22:49.498 --> 22:50.586
You're new.

22:50.630 --> 22:53.589
This is Julia.
Julia is my assistant.

22:53.633 --> 22:55.765
You have two assistants
who work past midnight

22:55.809 --> 22:59.595
For a real estate company
without any real estate?

22:59.639 --> 23:02.990
Now is not really
a good time.

23:03.033 --> 23:04.513
Yeah. I got that.

23:04.557 --> 23:06.210
Look. I know everything
at home sucks right now.

23:06.254 --> 23:07.908
I will call you tomorrow.

23:07.951 --> 23:09.605
Is our parents' divorce even a blip
on your radar?

23:09.649 --> 23:11.520
Because it sort of
feels like I'm

23:11.564 --> 23:13.783
The only one trying to hold
our family together,

23:13.827 --> 23:17.134
And I'm starting to wonder if
there's really any point.

23:31.105 --> 23:32.541
Welcome back.

23:35.065 --> 23:37.328
I know I'm the last person
you want to see right now.

23:37.372 --> 23:40.462
Whatever it is, we should work
it out with lawyers present.

23:40.506 --> 23:42.682
No lawyers, Jacob.
this is bigger than that.

23:42.725 --> 23:45.511
I think I know who
the sniper is targeting.

23:45.554 --> 23:48.383
Hamilton Dynamics had been
working on a coil accelerator

23:48.427 --> 23:50.646
That could penetrate
the kevlar on Batman's suit.

23:50.690 --> 23:53.649
When he disappeared,
we put the project on hold.

23:53.693 --> 23:55.695
Then Batwoman showed up.

23:55.738 --> 23:57.087
We had it reinstated.

23:57.131 --> 23:58.611
And the only 3
engineers intimately

23:58.654 --> 24:00.569
Connected
to the project

24:00.613 --> 24:01.831
Have already
been killed.

24:01.875 --> 24:03.659
Including the designer,
whose last check-in

24:03.703 --> 24:05.879
Was at one of Hamilton's
top-secret labs.

24:05.922 --> 24:07.489
When we find the gun,
I'll call you.

24:07.533 --> 24:09.665
A microspectrometer
can track the gun's

24:09.709 --> 24:11.580
Electromagnetic radiation.

24:11.624 --> 24:14.191
We don't have the technology to
do that here.

24:14.235 --> 24:16.280
Actually, we can
do that now, sir.

24:16.324 --> 24:18.108
Didn't mean to eavesdrop,

24:18.152 --> 24:20.850
But A.R.G.U.S. leant us microspectrometers
for testing last month.

24:20.894 --> 24:24.506
You know, I don't
recall this being
an open forum.

24:24.550 --> 24:28.292
Permission for a moment
alone, sir.

24:28.336 --> 24:29.685
It's urgent.

24:32.383 --> 24:33.689
Thank you, Jacob.

24:39.782 --> 24:41.697
If there's a coil accelerator
out there

24:41.741 --> 24:43.656
On the streets of Gotham,
you need to find it.

24:43.699 --> 24:46.310
We will, but I have
other pressing matters

24:46.354 --> 24:49.313
Apart from cleaning up another mess
created by my wife.

24:49.357 --> 24:50.706
The gun could kill
Batwoman.

24:50.750 --> 24:52.360
That's not really
my problem.

24:52.403 --> 24:53.709
Actually it is, sir.

24:53.753 --> 24:55.972
I said I'll deal
with it another time.

24:56.016 --> 24:59.236
Sir, she's your daughter.

24:59.280 --> 25:02.544
Kate is Batwoman,
and if there's someone

25:02.588 --> 25:04.720
Out there who wants to
kill her with this gun,

25:04.764 --> 25:06.853
We need to stop him.

25:20.780 --> 25:22.608
As you requested.

25:25.262 --> 25:26.655
Hmm.

25:28.614 --> 25:32.226
Then I have
what she wanted.

25:41.409 --> 25:43.454
Send Batwoman my love.

25:48.285 --> 25:50.070
Alpha team, report.

25:50.113 --> 25:52.028
First floor is clear.
Roof's clear.

25:52.072 --> 25:53.726
Are we sure
about this place?

25:53.769 --> 25:56.598
The radioactive signature on
the gun is off the charts.

25:56.642 --> 25:59.253
Whoever has it
is close by.

25:59.296 --> 26:00.602
You signed it.

26:00.646 --> 26:02.169
I told them what
they wanted to hear.

26:02.212 --> 26:03.518
You lied.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.041
I need this school, ok?

26:05.085 --> 26:06.390
I want to be here.

26:06.434 --> 26:08.218
But they don't
want you.

26:08.262 --> 26:10.177
Unfortunately, I don't
have the luxury

26:10.220 --> 26:12.353
Of being offended
by that...

26:14.050 --> 26:18.751
And maybe it's best if you just
kept your distance from now on.

26:18.794 --> 26:20.840
Hey.

26:20.883 --> 26:23.538
Don't leave me here

26:23.582 --> 26:27.063
I know you love me.

26:27.107 --> 26:29.065
Tell me that I'm wrong,
and I'll walk away

26:29.109 --> 26:33.766
And let you make the biggest
mistake of your life.

26:33.809 --> 26:35.332
You're wrong, Kate.

26:35.376 --> 26:37.204
I can't forget

26:37.247 --> 26:38.771
'cause I can't forget

26:38.814 --> 26:41.077
I have to go.

26:41.121 --> 26:44.820
It's burnin'

26:44.864 --> 26:49.477
still burnin'

26:49.520 --> 26:53.655
oh, I should...

26:53.699 --> 26:56.658
That's Kate's sharpshooter
competition medal.

26:56.702 --> 27:00.488
Cadet Kane doesn't
go here anymore.

27:00.531 --> 27:02.838
Do you even know
how she won that?

27:02.882 --> 27:05.798
Guess it doesn't really
matter, does it?

27:05.841 --> 27:08.583
She didn't even try.

27:08.627 --> 27:12.021
In fact, she was
so hungover

27:12.065 --> 27:13.936
From tequila shots
the night before,

27:13.980 --> 27:17.810
It was insane anyone
even handed her a gun,

27:17.853 --> 27:19.681
Don't leave me here

27:19.725 --> 27:23.032
And she still managed
to be the best.

27:23.076 --> 27:25.469
Out of 200 other cadets,
she hit the target

27:25.513 --> 27:27.863
Dead on every time

27:27.907 --> 27:31.258
Because Kate Kane
doesn't waver.

27:31.301 --> 27:32.694
She did more
for this school

27:32.738 --> 27:34.522
Than anyone who's
ever gone here,

27:34.565 --> 27:37.917
So you can scrub her name
from every plaque and banner

27:37.960 --> 27:39.527
And roster,

27:39.570 --> 27:41.137
But you will never
erase her

27:41.181 --> 27:43.879
Or the effect she's had
on the people here.

27:45.794 --> 27:49.145
Base to Moore.
what's your 20?

27:49.189 --> 27:51.495
No sign of him, sir.

27:51.539 --> 27:52.888
I'll check back in 5.

27:52.932 --> 27:54.890
10-4.

27:54.934 --> 27:59.503
-Anything?
-No. Not yet.

27:59.547 --> 28:01.505
And what did
Sophie want?

28:01.549 --> 28:05.031
Eh, it's complicated.

28:07.947 --> 28:11.646
Is it me, or does everything
lately seem complicated?

28:13.343 --> 28:15.084
But the thing
about complicated is

28:15.128 --> 28:18.740
We handle it better
than anyone I know.

28:18.784 --> 28:23.745
We met under the most complicated
circumstances imaginable.

28:23.789 --> 28:26.356
You were so lost, Jacob,
so full of guilt

28:26.400 --> 28:28.358
And anger
and hopelessness.

28:28.402 --> 28:31.535
All I wanted to do was
give you a place to put it all,

28:31.579 --> 28:33.755
So we channeled it
all right here.

28:38.455 --> 28:40.196
If we can turn the pain
into power,

28:40.240 --> 28:43.112
We can do anything,
Jacob,

28:43.156 --> 28:45.593
As long as
we do it together.

29:06.266 --> 29:08.050
What are you
doing here?

29:08.094 --> 29:11.010
You need to get out
of this building.

29:11.053 --> 29:13.229
Seriously, you need
to leave now.

29:13.273 --> 29:14.665
Sophie.

29:14.709 --> 29:16.015
Before you say anything,

29:16.058 --> 29:17.712
I want you to know

29:17.756 --> 29:20.410
if I could do it
all over again,

29:20.454 --> 29:22.935
I would have jumped
on the back of your bike

29:22.978 --> 29:25.372
and left point rock
in my dust.

29:25.415 --> 29:28.070
Did you tell Jacob Kane?

29:28.114 --> 29:33.075
Yes, but I didn't tell him
because I'm loyal to the Crows.

29:33.119 --> 29:36.731
I told him because you're going
to get yourself killed,

29:36.775 --> 29:38.515
If not by us then by one
of your enemies,

29:38.559 --> 29:40.561
And if that ever
happened...

29:46.480 --> 29:48.177
Kate, I can't
lose you.

29:48.221 --> 29:49.831
Sophie?

29:54.357 --> 29:55.837
What the hell
is going on?

29:55.881 --> 29:58.840
I was about to ask you
the same thing.

29:58.884 --> 30:03.627
Touching story.
I couldn't help myself.

30:03.671 --> 30:05.064
How are you
here, Kate?

30:07.153 --> 30:08.763
Aah!

30:08.807 --> 30:10.199
There's an electromagnetic surge

30:10.243 --> 30:11.635
On the second floor.

30:11.679 --> 30:13.115
All units, converge!

30:19.556 --> 30:20.862
What the hell was that?

30:20.906 --> 30:22.995
A coil accelerator.

30:26.520 --> 30:27.869
No sign
of the assassin, sir.

30:27.913 --> 30:32.004
We got one better--
Batwoman.

30:32.047 --> 30:34.441
Bring her to me.

30:34.484 --> 30:36.051
I thought her suit
was bulletproof.

30:36.095 --> 30:37.879
That's what I was
trying to tell you

30:37.923 --> 30:40.316
Or her--whatever.

30:40.360 --> 30:43.929
Whoever shot her used a gun
that could kill her.

30:59.814 --> 31:01.120
What the hell
are you doing?

31:01.163 --> 31:02.469
Getting her back!

31:02.512 --> 31:04.036
Kate:
Luke, come in. Luke.

31:04.079 --> 31:05.733
Hey. I've been
trying to reach you.

31:05.776 --> 31:07.300
I heard the explosion
over comms

31:07.343 --> 31:08.910
And got worried
when you didn't report in.

31:08.954 --> 31:11.086
The Crows have Julia.
activate the suit's GPS.

31:11.130 --> 31:13.175
Please tell me this has nothing to do
with the massive amounts

31:13.219 --> 31:15.482
Of electromagnetic radiation
spewing from that area.

31:15.525 --> 31:17.092
Just activate the GPS.

31:17.136 --> 31:19.094
Ok. they're on 5th and Grant
in the Bowery.

31:20.530 --> 31:22.881
They're headed
toward the 22nd Street tunnel.

31:36.459 --> 31:37.983
Once they're through,
they're at Crows headquarters,

31:38.026 --> 31:39.506
And Julia's screwed.

31:39.549 --> 31:41.116
You got to do something
right now.

32:13.496 --> 32:15.672
Get your ass on the ground!

32:17.022 --> 32:18.937
Get on the ground!

32:34.039 --> 32:36.432
-Hey.
-Oh, thank god.

32:36.476 --> 32:38.173
What the hell was that?

32:38.217 --> 32:40.480
You were hit by a gun that could
have killed you.

32:40.523 --> 32:42.395
I don't know
why it didn't.

32:48.662 --> 32:50.577
The gun didn't work.

32:50.620 --> 32:53.232
You said the projectile
would penetrate the suit.

32:53.275 --> 32:57.018
Oh, dear.
how puzzling it all is,

32:57.062 --> 33:01.457
And to think you
personally killed

33:01.501 --> 33:04.199
Everyone capable
of fixing it.

33:04.243 --> 33:07.028
Oh, wait. I had
my little Mouse kill one.

33:07.072 --> 33:10.640
Guess I'm 1/3
responsible. oops!

33:10.684 --> 33:12.164
Listen, you crazy bitch.

33:12.207 --> 33:15.210
You didn't just play me.
you played her.

33:15.254 --> 33:17.430
Sofiyah's gonna be pissed--

33:17.473 --> 33:23.305
Don't you ever say her name
in front of me!

33:23.349 --> 33:26.178
Ahh.

33:26.221 --> 33:28.223
She's a smart woman.

33:28.267 --> 33:29.833
She'll figure it out.

33:29.877 --> 33:32.227
She's as smart
as she is unforgiving.

33:32.271 --> 33:34.838
Whatever reason
you betrayed her,

33:34.882 --> 33:37.145
Better be worth it.

33:52.160 --> 33:53.770
As you requested.

33:55.990 --> 33:58.253
See, dear sister?

33:58.297 --> 34:02.214
There isn't anything
i wouldn't do to protect you.

34:12.353 --> 34:16.097
Oi. oh, careful.

34:16.141 --> 34:18.230
I'm livid The Rifle
got away.

34:18.273 --> 34:22.103
The broken ribs from our little
ruse aren't helping either.

34:22.147 --> 34:25.193
Heh. Consider us even.

34:25.237 --> 34:26.976
So I thought
about it,

34:27.021 --> 34:31.112
And it makes sense,
the not trusting people thing.

34:31.156 --> 34:33.331
Clear as day,
in fact.

34:33.375 --> 34:35.159
Don't tell me.
you've figured me out.

34:35.203 --> 34:39.251
I was gonna say
I'm sorry.

34:39.293 --> 34:41.905
I should have been straight about
who I was when we met,

34:41.949 --> 34:45.387
Especially once
feelings got involved.

34:45.431 --> 34:49.261
Instead, I burned you, and now
your girl Sophie's doing the same,

34:49.304 --> 34:50.697
Trust be damned.

34:50.739 --> 34:52.132
She is not my girl.

34:52.177 --> 34:55.310
Whoever she is,
it's a shame

34:55.353 --> 34:57.747
Because she loves you.

34:57.791 --> 34:59.140
Not to crash
the party,

34:59.184 --> 35:01.186
But the knife
police recovered

35:01.229 --> 35:02.839
From Derek Holcomb's
chest

35:02.883 --> 35:04.232
Was a butterfly knife.

35:04.276 --> 35:06.321
You think it's Alice's.

35:06.365 --> 35:08.236
Why would she want
him dead?

35:12.849 --> 35:14.547
She hired The Rifle
to kill anyone

35:14.590 --> 35:16.375
Who was connected
to the gun

35:16.418 --> 35:18.159
And then tried to kill
me with it.

35:18.203 --> 35:20.379
Sounds like delicious
family drama--

35:20.422 --> 35:22.337
Unh--and unfortunately,
i won't get to see

35:22.381 --> 35:24.034
How the play ends.

35:24.078 --> 35:25.732
You're leaving?
There's a sniper on the loose

35:25.775 --> 35:27.168
Who is trying to
kill me.

35:27.212 --> 35:28.952
Relax, love. my agency's
just got word

35:28.996 --> 35:30.954
He's headed back to an island
off the mediterranean

35:30.998 --> 35:32.434
With that gun in tow,
which means I'm

35:32.478 --> 35:35.785
On a one-way flight
to Santorini.

35:35.829 --> 35:38.571
Just don't get
yourself killed.

35:38.614 --> 35:40.225
I'm touched you care.

35:42.227 --> 35:44.794
See you again soon,
Kate.

35:44.838 --> 35:47.145
Luke, always
a pleasure.

35:51.671 --> 35:54.369
You know, apart
from my father

35:54.413 --> 35:58.330
And Lucius of course,
Bruce Wayne never trusted a soul.

35:58.373 --> 36:00.201
Now I'm not judging
his choices.

36:00.245 --> 36:02.203
I wasn't in his shoes,
but...

36:02.247 --> 36:04.205
When you don't
trust anyone,

36:04.249 --> 36:06.294
It means that you can
disappear for 4 years

36:06.338 --> 36:10.255
Without a single person on the planet
having any idea where you are.

36:10.298 --> 36:12.996
Now, call me
sentimental,

36:13.040 --> 36:16.391
But I don't think
that's a good thing.

36:31.841 --> 36:33.452
Nice digs.

36:33.495 --> 36:36.716
Gotham pride real estate's
first acquisition.

36:36.759 --> 36:40.241
Catchy name.

36:40.285 --> 36:43.375
So I heard someone
took out a Crows van

36:43.418 --> 36:45.855
With a 50-meter
precision shot.

36:45.899 --> 36:48.597
I got the impression
that Batwoman means a lot to you,

36:48.641 --> 36:52.122
And I didn't want
her to end up in the wrong hands.

36:52.166 --> 36:55.430
Brought you something
to celebrate,

36:55.474 --> 36:58.303
And I cleared things
up with your dad,

36:58.346 --> 37:01.306
Told him I was wrong
about the Batwoman thing

37:01.349 --> 37:05.048
And how I assumed you
weren't real with me

37:05.092 --> 37:08.051
Because of went down
at point rock.

37:08.095 --> 37:11.272
Me in a red wig?
it's not happening.

37:11.316 --> 37:13.448
Then why did you invite
me to dinner?

37:13.492 --> 37:15.755
Still have to
tell myself to breathe.

37:15.798 --> 37:20.281
I, uh--i needed to
clear things up with you.

37:23.371 --> 37:26.548
As hard as I've tried
to get over you,

37:26.592 --> 37:29.072
I can't,

37:29.116 --> 37:31.858
And it's--it's not
fair to you,

37:31.901 --> 37:35.470
And based on what
i heard you tell Batwoman,

37:35.514 --> 37:38.343
It's definitely not
fair to Tyler.

37:38.386 --> 37:41.476
Breathe in,
break down

37:41.520 --> 37:43.478
-Kate--
-Actually, I think

37:43.522 --> 37:48.396
You were right
6 years ago,

37:48.440 --> 37:50.006
And maybe it's best
if I keep

37:50.050 --> 37:52.531
My distance
from now on.

37:52.574 --> 37:55.098
I keep running
in circles

37:55.142 --> 37:58.667
If that's what you think
will work.

37:58.711 --> 38:00.800
I think it has to.

38:00.843 --> 38:03.542
and I hate her,
i love her, I miss her

38:03.585 --> 38:06.327
I want her back
sometimes...

38:06.371 --> 38:08.547
Good luck
with the place.

38:08.590 --> 38:11.332
See you, Sophie.

38:11.376 --> 38:14.901
and she keeps running
through my mind

38:14.944 --> 38:17.382
oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh

38:17.425 --> 38:20.950
and she keeps running
through my mind

38:20.994 --> 38:25.564
oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh

38:25.607 --> 38:29.524
still, I have to
remind myself it's over

38:29.568 --> 38:32.571
and fight back the urge
to hold her

38:32.614 --> 38:36.009
because these hands,
they used to know her

38:36.052 --> 38:38.620
body and soul

38:38.664 --> 38:41.406
it always comes back
around to her

38:41.449 --> 38:44.496
it always comes back to
running in circles

38:44.539 --> 38:46.541
Batman was praised and revered,

38:46.585 --> 38:49.501
but Bruce Wayne not so much.

38:49.544 --> 38:51.720
No one knew the man
beneath the cowl.

38:51.764 --> 38:55.507
You didn't let them in, Bruce,
for good reason.

38:55.550 --> 38:58.292
Because even the people we love

38:58.336 --> 39:02.209
are still people
at the end of the day.

39:02.252 --> 39:06.300
You want the truth?

39:06.344 --> 39:08.389
The truth is anything
i felt for Kate Kane

39:08.433 --> 39:13.394
went away the day
i chose my future over her.

39:13.438 --> 39:16.571
You're the only one
i love, Tyler.

39:21.228 --> 39:24.840
ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah

39:24.884 --> 39:31.238
They act out of fear,
pride, hope, pain,

39:31.281 --> 39:34.981
and sometimes,
they let us down,

39:35.024 --> 39:36.591
but you know better
than I do

39:36.635 --> 39:38.898
that no one can be
a lone wolf forever.

39:38.941 --> 39:40.421
Need a hand with that?

39:40.465 --> 39:42.554
That is exactly
why I called.

39:42.597 --> 39:45.426
So of all the dumps
for sale in Gotham,

39:45.470 --> 39:47.210
Why this place?

39:47.254 --> 39:52.302
The guy across the street
asked me to leave his restaurant.

39:52.346 --> 39:55.218
I wonder how he'll like it
when I turn this joint

39:55.262 --> 39:57.786
into a gay bar.

39:57.830 --> 40:01.442
So obviously, I'm
running point on design.

40:01.486 --> 40:03.444
I have to let people in

40:03.488 --> 40:05.794
Even if it's just one person

40:05.838 --> 40:08.449
And one small piece
of myself at a time.

40:10.625 --> 40:13.454
Hey, kid.
just checking in.

40:13.498 --> 40:15.935
My lead on cartwright
upstate was a dead end.

40:15.978 --> 40:18.546
Guy I found came up clean.

40:18.590 --> 40:21.854
Waste of a couple of days.
worth a shot.

40:21.897 --> 40:24.030
Anyway, I'll probably stay
up here another night

40:24.073 --> 40:25.466
And then head back
to Gotham

40:25.510 --> 40:27.250
To figure out
our next move.

40:27.294 --> 40:29.165
Hope you're good.

40:39.306 --> 40:42.788
Daddy, you are
so handsome.

40:48.097 --> 40:50.665
Catherine seems to think so.

40:50.709 --> 40:54.495
I assumed you'd let
the snake slither back

40:54.539 --> 40:56.845
Into her husband's good graces.

40:56.889 --> 41:01.589
Burrowed in so deep,
i can still hear her rattle.

41:01.633 --> 41:04.113
They'll never see
it coming.

41:04.157 --> 41:08.727
"A red-hot poker will burn
you if you hold it too long,

41:08.770 --> 41:13.166
"and if you cut your finger
deeply with a knife,

41:13.209 --> 41:15.777
"it usually bleeds,

41:15.821 --> 41:20.913
"and if you drink much
from a bottle marked poison,

41:20.956 --> 41:25.918
It is almost certain
to disagree with you
sooner or later."

41:25.961 --> 41:29.399
Heh heh.

41:29.443 --> 41:32.620
Get some sleep,
my dear Mouse.

41:32.664 --> 41:34.535
We need to be in our prime

41:34.579 --> 41:38.365
If we are to host
the most memorable

41:38.408 --> 41:40.541
mad tea party

41:40.585 --> 41:43.326
Gotham has ever seen.

41:43.370 --> 41:46.547
Ha ha ha!
