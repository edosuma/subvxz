W. S. Gilbert wrote,

00:33.248 --> 00:36.876
"It's love that makes the world go 'round."

00:36.911 --> 00:37.814
And if that's true,

00:37.849 --> 00:41.298
then the world spun a little faster with Haley in it.

00:42.547 --> 00:46.714
Haley was my best friend since we were in high school.

00:46.780 --> 00:48.580
We certainly had our struggles, but

00:49.412 --> 00:52.680
if there's one thing we agreed on unconditionally,

00:52.747 --> 00:56.314
it was our love and commitment to our son Jack.

00:57.274 --> 01:00.480
Haley's love for Jack was joyous

01:00.547 --> 01:02.947
and fierce.

01:04.513 --> 01:08.380
That fierceness is why she isn't here today.

01:08.447 --> 01:12.947
A mother's love is an unrivaled force of nature.

01:13.014 --> 01:16.747
And we can all learn much from the way Haley lived her life.

01:18.614 --> 01:21.614
Haley's death causes each of us to stop

01:21.680 --> 01:24.461
and take stock of our lives.

01:24.496 --> 01:26.680
To measure who we are

01:26.747 --> 01:29.147
and what we've become.

01:30.480 --> 01:34.047
I don't have all those answers for myself,

01:34.114 --> 01:36.814
but I know who Haley was.

01:37.259 --> 01:38.380
She was the woman who died

01:38.447 --> 01:42.453
protecting the child we brought into this world together.

01:42.488 --> 01:43.970
And I will make sure that Jack grows up

01:44.005 --> 01:48.881
knowing who his mother was and how she loved and protected him

01:49.519 --> 01:51.480
and how much I loved her.

01:54.214 --> 01:55.477
If Haley were with us today,

01:55.512 --> 01:58.147
she would ask us not to mourn her death

01:58.214 --> 02:00.614
but to celebrate her life.

02:05.014 --> 02:06.513
She would tell us

02:10.348 --> 02:14.480
She would tell us to love our families unconditionally

02:14.547 --> 02:15.947
And to hold them close,

02:16.014 --> 02:19.814
because in the end, they are all that matter.

02:20.327 --> 02:21.714
I met Haley at the tryouts

02:21.780 --> 02:25.148
of our high school's production of "The pirates of Penzance."

02:25.183 --> 02:26.947
I found our copy of the play

02:27.014 --> 02:28.461
and was looking through it the other night,

02:28.496 --> 02:32.498
and I came upon a passage that seemed

02:32.533 --> 02:35.014
appropriate for this moment.

02:35.847 --> 02:38.964
"Oh, dry the glistening tear

02:38.999 --> 02:42.081
"that dews that martial cheek.

02:42.147 --> 02:44.998
"Thy loving children hear,

02:45.033 --> 02:47.673
"In them thy comfort seek.

02:47.708 --> 02:50.314
"With sympathetic care

02:50.380 --> 02:54.281
"their arms around thee creep,

02:54.348 --> 02:57.480
"for, oh, they cannot bear

02:57.547 --> 02:59.814
to see their father weep."

03:17.114 --> 03:19.580
Ok, you can go ahead.

03:22.914 --> 03:25.314
Blow mommy a kiss.

03:39.714 --> 03:41.154
If there's anything I can do

03:41.189 --> 03:43.580
Thank you.

03:43.647 --> 03:45.214
I'm so sorry for your loss.

03:45.281 --> 03:46.167
Thank you, Gina.

03:46.202 --> 03:48.147
Thank you for coming.

03:49.947 --> 03:52.780
I think you could use some air.

03:53.513 --> 03:54.647
Jack's ok.

03:54.714 --> 03:56.150
I saw him with his cousins.

03:56.185 --> 03:57.234
Ok.

03:57.269 --> 03:58.847
Jessica, would you make sure that

03:58.914 --> 04:00.314
Jack gets something to eat?

04:00.380 --> 04:00.921
Sure.

04:00.956 --> 04:02.547
And I'll be right back.

04:02.614 --> 04:04.248
Thanks.

04:11.647 --> 04:13.547
What do we do?

04:13.614 --> 04:15.248
There's nothing we can do.

04:15.314 --> 04:17.579
We just gotta wait him out.

04:17.647 --> 04:19.314
You think he'll ever come back?

04:19.380 --> 04:20.214
Would you?

04:20.281 --> 04:21.613
He'll come back.

04:21.680 --> 04:24.380
I just don't know what he's gonna look like when he does.

04:24.447 --> 04:28.014
We just need to be there for him when he's ready.

04:29.667 --> 04:32.047
You know, I broke my promise to Haley.

04:32.114 --> 04:33.780
What promise?

04:34.344 --> 04:36.214
I told her that I would catch Foyet

04:36.281 --> 04:40.248
and that I'd spend the rest of my life making it up to her.

04:40.314 --> 04:42.647
You still can.

04:42.714 --> 04:45.480
You saved Jack.

04:51.714 --> 04:54.914
You know, I may have the tools to do this job,

04:54.981 --> 04:57.747
but I don't know if I have the tools to help my son.

04:59.680 --> 05:01.360
You have to ask yourself

05:01.395 --> 05:04.480
what kind of father you want to be.

05:04.547 --> 05:07.147
And when you figure that out

05:07.214 --> 05:10.714
Then you'll know what to do.

05:15.248 --> 05:17.214
I meant what I said today.

05:17.281 --> 05:19.447
Things have changed.

05:20.513 --> 05:24.047
And I need to do what's best for Jack.

05:25.281 --> 05:27.914
You will.

05:36.147 --> 05:38.047
They can't be calling us in, not tonight.

05:38.114 --> 05:39.680
I'm on it.

05:40.881 --> 05:43.614
We can't go.

05:43.680 --> 05:45.214
We have to.

05:45.281 --> 05:46.480
I'll get Rossi.

05:46.547 --> 05:49.214
Talk to Strauss, tell her to send another team.

05:49.766 --> 05:51.380
There's no other team available.

05:51.447 --> 05:52.732
Nashville's calling us in.

05:52.767 --> 05:56.580
Second body in two weeks, both killed on consecutive friday nights.

05:56.647 --> 05:58.321
They realize they're up against the clock

05:58.356 --> 06:02.214
and they're hoping we might find something they didn't.

06:05.513 --> 06:07.081
Guys.

06:07.147 --> 06:09.847
I'm sorry, but we just got called in.

06:10.466 --> 06:12.047
We have to go.

06:12.114 --> 06:14.348
Call me if you need anything.

06:14.413 --> 06:16.181
Take care of your son.

06:16.248 --> 06:17.580
Thanks.

06:20.691 --> 06:22.513
You gonna be ok?

06:23.607 --> 06:26.914
I'll see you when you get back.

06:48.781 --> 06:50.547
"Where we love is home--

06:51.118 --> 06:52.380
"home that our feet may leave,

06:53.053 --> 06:54.539
but not our hearts."

06:55.034 --> 06:56.148
Oliver Wendell Holmes.

07:00.747 --> 07:02.314
Two women dead in two weeks,

07:02.381 --> 07:03.647
both killed in their own homes,

07:03.713 --> 07:05.780
and no sign of forced entry.

07:05.847 --> 07:08.181
Floors were covered in rose petals.

07:08.247 --> 07:09.314
Quite the romantic.

07:09.381 --> 07:11.514
Evidence of sexual assault?

07:11.580 --> 07:12.514
None.

07:12.580 --> 07:13.747
Both women were last seen

07:13.814 --> 07:15.247
leaving their offices on a friday

07:15.314 --> 07:17.181
and never showed up to work on a monday.

07:17.247 --> 07:19.847
It's thursday. Why are we only being called in now?

07:19.914 --> 07:22.081
The second body was only found yesterday.

07:22.147 --> 07:24.301
There may be a soci o-Economic pattern emerging.

07:24.336 --> 07:26.147
The first victim, Bethany Heminger,

07:26.214 --> 07:28.747
lived in Belle Meade, Melissa Johnson in Brentwood.

07:28.814 --> 07:30.647
Both are affluent neighborhoods.

07:30.713 --> 07:32.859
Yet there was nothing missing from either home.

07:32.894 --> 07:34.112
What did these women do for a living?

07:34.147 --> 07:37.014
Bethany was a defense attorney, Melissa a corporate executive.

07:37.081 --> 07:38.613
Two brunettes with similar features

07:38.680 --> 07:41.548
in high-powered professions? That's not a coincidence.

07:41.613 --> 07:44.514
These women most likely represent someone he knows.

07:44.580 --> 07:46.247
All right, so we need to figure out where this unsub

07:46.314 --> 07:48.847
is meeting his victims and how he's gaining access to their homes.

07:48.914 --> 07:50.281
And if he's staying on pattern,

07:50.347 --> 07:52.347
most likely this guy has picked out his next target.

07:52.414 --> 07:54.680
We should check gardeners,

07:54.747 --> 07:57.314
housekeeping staff, pool attendants,

07:57.381 --> 07:58.322
floral shops,

07:58.357 --> 08:00.448
see if anyone worked both homes.

08:00.514 --> 08:02.107
Start working up a paper trail, Garcia.

08:02.142 --> 08:03.307
Find out where these women were

08:03.342 --> 08:04.713
in the days leading up to each murder.

08:04.780 --> 08:06.980
<i>Like a genie in a bottle-- Poof!</i>

08:08.791 --> 08:09.814
All right. Prentiss, you and I

08:09.880 --> 08:11.814
are gonna go check out the Johnson crime scene.

08:11.880 --> 08:13.580
Rossi, you and Reid talk to the coroner,

08:13.647 --> 08:15.181
start working up victimology.

08:15.247 --> 08:17.314
JJ, talk to the families and staff

08:17.381 --> 08:19.247
and find a connection we can use.

08:19.314 --> 08:22.880
I understand that all of our thoughts are with Hotch.

08:22.947 --> 08:27.181
But right now, I need us all to focus on this case.

08:27.247 --> 08:30.314
We have less than a day before this unsub will strike again.

08:30.971 --> 08:32.914
Let's finish this thing fast.

08:44.514 --> 08:46.047
You must be the FBI.

08:46.114 --> 08:47.548
Landon Kaminski.

08:47.613 --> 08:49.014
Agent Jareau. We spoke on the phone.

08:49.081 --> 08:50.381
Yeah, it's nice to meet you.

08:50.448 --> 08:51.370
The mayor's on my ass.

08:51.405 --> 08:53.181
Two prominent women killed on my watch

08:53.247 --> 08:54.680
and everyone knows we're bracing for a third.

08:54.747 --> 08:56.263
Well, let's hope that doesn't happen.

08:56.298 --> 08:57.780
Where would you like us to set up?

08:57.847 --> 08:59.448
In here.

09:00.054 --> 09:02.081
I'm gonna need to issue a statement with the press.

09:02.147 --> 09:03.914
Every woman in Nashville needs to know

09:03.980 --> 09:05.613
there's a serial killer on the loose.

09:05.680 --> 09:07.914
We need them taking preventative measures

09:07.980 --> 09:09.548
to avoid becoming his next target.

09:09.613 --> 09:12.314
The mayor thinks we should be as specific as possible.

09:12.381 --> 09:15.014
Every woman, detective.

09:15.081 --> 09:17.814
His first two victims may be from the same social class,

09:17.880 --> 09:19.947
but if we isolate victimology this soon,

09:20.014 --> 09:22.414
it may cause him to go outside of his own comfort zone,

09:22.481 --> 09:24.014
and then he'll be even harder to track.

09:24.670 --> 09:25.847
Better to stress hypervigilance

09:25.914 --> 09:27.747
and shut down his victim pool completely,

09:27.814 --> 09:29.314
don't you think?

09:30.881 --> 09:32.081
Yes, ma'am.

09:37.330 --> 09:38.580
Well, the house has a security system,

09:38.647 --> 09:40.093
but her friends say that she only used it

09:40.128 --> 09:42.414
when she traveled out of town.

09:42.481 --> 09:43.647
He killed the dog,

09:43.713 --> 09:45.847
hid it in a storage container in the garage.

09:45.914 --> 09:48.147
She probably thought he was protection enough.

09:48.214 --> 09:49.947
That was her first mistake.

09:50.014 --> 09:51.914
She had all the precautions to avoid home invasion,

09:51.980 --> 09:53.514
she just didn't use them properly.

09:53.580 --> 09:54.680
These are the prints

09:54.747 --> 09:56.247
that match the other crime scene.

09:56.314 --> 09:58.580
It looks like he didn't hesitate to get them everywhere.

09:58.647 --> 10:01.147
Which typically would indicate that he's disorganized.

10:01.762 --> 10:03.947
This crime scene screams of organization.

10:05.019 --> 10:06.181
The roses,

10:06.247 --> 10:08.181
the dog.

10:08.247 --> 10:09.613
He was a stranger to these women.

10:09.680 --> 10:11.580
He didn't talk his way in, he was laying in wait.

10:11.647 --> 10:15.014
And he knew his prints wouldn't show up in the system.

10:15.564 --> 10:17.386
He had no priors, which means he was smart

10:17.421 --> 10:18.880
and most likely educated.

10:18.947 --> 10:20.381
This guy knew exactly what he was doing

10:20.448 --> 10:22.630
and he made sure he had enough time to do it.

10:22.665 --> 10:24.181
So, he knew when she'd leave the house

10:24.247 --> 10:26.214
and when she'd return.

10:26.281 --> 10:28.680
He's stalking them.

10:51.921 --> 10:54.835
It's only the victim's prints on the exterior doorknobs.

10:54.870 --> 10:57.629
Nothing on the windows, the garage wasn't forced.

10:57.664 --> 10:59.147
So how did he get in?

11:03.135 --> 11:04.900
Defensive wounds on both women.

11:05.100 --> 11:07.014
More so on the latest victim.

11:07.546 --> 11:08.980
She fought back the hardest.

11:09.047 --> 11:11.033
No ligature marks. They weren't bound.

11:11.068 --> 11:13.019
So how does he keep them from running out?

11:13.054 --> 11:14.414
Maybe he blocked the escape route,

11:14.481 --> 11:16.014
or maybe the threat of a knife was enough.

11:16.081 --> 11:17.459
I might be able to answer that.

11:17.494 --> 11:19.114
The stab wounds weren't the only injuries.

11:19.181 --> 11:20.281
What do you mean?

11:20.347 --> 11:22.297
Melissa Johnson had a concussion.

11:22.332 --> 11:24.247
Bethany Heminger, a broken rib.

11:24.724 --> 11:27.049
An initial assault to prove his dominance,

11:27.084 --> 11:29.880
make sure they're too scared to try and escape.

11:29.947 --> 11:32.281
Something else you should see.

11:33.957 --> 11:35.481
Both their stomach contents were the same.

11:35.548 --> 11:38.947
Chicken, broccoli, pasta, salad, and red wine.

11:39.452 --> 11:41.214
He's playing out a fantasy.

11:41.281 --> 11:42.876
One he has to control.

11:42.911 --> 11:46.112
He sets the scene with flower petals and wine

11:46.147 --> 11:48.329
and then he cooks for them.

11:48.364 --> 11:50.314
Their last supper.

11:51.548 --> 11:53.885
So he cooked, and he cleaned up after himself.

11:53.920 --> 11:55.973
Why did he leave the petal trail?

11:56.008 --> 11:57.992
It's gotta mean something our guy.

11:58.027 --> 12:00.113
He's not just reliving a fantasy, he's repeating it.

12:00.114 --> 12:02.414
It's the same routine, the same meal.

12:02.883 --> 12:05.946
It's not just routine, it's proper etiquette.

12:06.710 --> 12:07.790
What?

12:07.825 --> 12:08.814
Wha... Take a look at this.

12:08.880 --> 12:11.979
There's a handprint in the center back of this chair right here.

12:11.980 --> 12:14.381
He pulled this chair out for himself.

12:14.448 --> 12:15.897
Over here, there are handprints

12:15.932 --> 12:17.347
on either side of the chair.

12:18.030 --> 12:20.214
He pulled this chair out for her,

12:20.281 --> 12:22.181
poured her wine...

12:22.526 --> 12:25.580
And even cleaned up after the meal was done.

12:26.332 --> 12:27.942
But up he something changed.

12:27.977 --> 12:29.517
Then he drew her a bath.

12:29.552 --> 12:31.214
And this is where Melissa Johnson was murdered.

12:31.281 --> 12:33.181
This is where the fantasy ended.

12:33.247 --> 12:34.381
Because she broke it?

12:34.886 --> 12:35.580
I would.

12:35.647 --> 12:36.756
What do you mean?

12:36.791 --> 12:39.830
Well, after the initial assault downstairs,

12:39.865 --> 12:41.972
fine, I'm scared,

12:42.007 --> 12:44.147
but I'm still looking for another chance to escape.

12:44.214 --> 12:46.847
Dinner, wine, dishes.

12:46.882 --> 12:48.147
I'm not in any immediate danger,

12:48.214 --> 12:51.254
so I can take my time, wait for the right moment.

12:51.289 --> 12:53.747
I do what he says because I don't want him to hurt me again.

12:54.319 --> 12:56.410
But once he gets me in here,

12:56.445 --> 12:58.466
I am at my most vulnerable.

12:58.501 --> 13:01.114
So fear takes over and she fights back.

13:02.260 --> 13:03.613
Because if she doesn't...

13:05.366 --> 13:08.138
Home is where you're supposed to feel safe.

13:08.512 --> 13:11.114
Nobody deserves to have that taken away.

13:12.448 --> 13:14.580
<i>Whoo-Hoo!</i>

13:14.647 --> 13:15.880
<i>Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!</i>

13:15.947 --> 13:17.047
<i>Aah!</i>

13:17.114 --> 13:18.814
<i>Ha ha!</i>

13:18.880 --> 13:20.880
<i>Ooh!</i>

13:20.947 --> 13:22.847
<i>Ohh!</i>

13:22.914 --> 13:25.281
<i>All right, right in there!</i>

13:25.347 --> 13:26.281
<i>Whoo!</i>

13:26.849 --> 13:28.914
<i>Aah!</i>

13:36.225 --> 13:38.247
Hey, buddy, it time for pjs.

13:38.314 --> 13:40.114
Can I watch one more time?

13:40.768 --> 13:42.747
I'm waiting for mommy.

13:44.414 --> 13:46.747
<i>All right, ready to make a wish.</i>

13:46.814 --> 13:48.347
<i>Ok. One...</i>

13:48.414 --> 13:50.114
<i>two</i>

13:50.181 --> 13:51.680
<i>three. Blow 'em out!</i>

13:53.780 --> 13:56.713
<i>Nice job!</i>

13:56.780 --> 13:58.247
<i>Ok. Happy birthday.</i>

13:58.314 --> 13:59.247
<i>Say, hi, daddy.</i>

13:59.314 --> 14:00.247
<i>Hi, daddy.</i>

14:00.314 --> 14:01.281
<i>Mwah!</i>

14:01.347 --> 14:03.081
I miss her, too.

14:03.147 --> 14:04.347
<i>Mwah! Mwah!</i>

14:04.814 --> 14:07.714
Can I sleep in your room again?

14:07.781 --> 14:09.380
Sure.

14:11.357 --> 14:13.247
Ok, come on.

14:25.385 --> 14:26.314
Find anything?

14:26.380 --> 14:28.180
Several people had access to each home.

14:28.247 --> 14:30.813
Housekeeper, gardener, pool cleaner, dog walker,

14:30.848 --> 14:33.380
each with their own key and an alibi to match.

14:33.447 --> 14:34.581
Any cross-over?

14:34.647 --> 14:35.464
None.

14:35.499 --> 14:36.881
We even vetted delivery people

14:36.948 --> 14:38.380
and utility workers.

14:38.447 --> 14:39.626
Garcia, do you have anything?

14:39.661 --> 14:41.178
<i>There's no hits on the prints at all,</i>

14:41.213 --> 14:42.696
<i>but I did what sir Derek there asked</i>

14:42.731 --> 14:43.962
and I created a paper trail.

14:43.997 --> 14:46.235
There's no cross-over between the two victims themselves

14:46.270 --> 14:47.922
in the wee leading up to their murders,

14:47.957 --> 14:49.574
but they did run in similar circles.

14:49.609 --> 14:50.656
How do you mean?

14:50.691 --> 14:52.575
<i>They both have country club memberships,</i>

14:52.610 --> 14:53.672
<i>though to different clubs.</i>

14:53.707 --> 14:55.733
They went to upscale restaurants,

14:55.768 --> 14:57.724
private concert venues, posh hotels.

14:57.759 --> 15:00.750
<i>They enjoyed a high-class, highfalutin lifestyle,</i>

15:00.785 --> 15:01.607
<i>an expensive one.</i>

15:01.642 --> 15:03.314
A lifestyle he'd fit right into.

15:03.380 --> 15:05.726
This guy is educated, intelligent,

15:05.761 --> 15:08.038
proper. He's a downright gentleman.

15:08.073 --> 15:10.113
The rose petals sent a pretty specific message.

15:10.180 --> 15:11.906
He's romancing them whether they want it or not.

15:11.941 --> 15:13.696
He's got the social skills to back it up.

15:13.731 --> 15:15.451
Hey, Garcia, take a look at dating services

15:15.486 --> 15:17.033
and social networking sites.

15:17.068 --> 15:19.701
Look for working professionals and privileged elite.

15:19.736 --> 15:21.043
<i>Check, check, and checkers.</i>

15:21.078 --> 15:22.948
<i>Back in a smidge.</i>

15:23.013 --> 15:24.414
We need more.

15:24.481 --> 15:27.047
Have we figured out how he's getting into these homes?

15:27.113 --> 15:28.814
No sign of forced entry anywhere.

15:29.544 --> 15:31.080
Yet he's still gaining access to their homes

15:31.147 --> 15:33.347
long before the victims ever get home from work.

15:33.749 --> 15:36.546
I mean, this guy needs time to cook and set up his scene.

15:36.977 --> 15:39.013
He's either got a key or he can move through walls.

15:39.080 --> 15:40.447
We need fresh eyes.

15:40.987 --> 15:41.547
All right, listen up.

15:41.614 --> 15:44.224
I want everybody to go back to the hotel and try to get some rest.

15:44.259 --> 15:45.797
We're gonna have to pick this up again in the morning.

15:45.832 --> 15:47.481
W-- We're giving up?

15:47.547 --> 15:49.247
No. We're gonna take a break.

15:49.772 --> 15:51.426
We have to give the profile at morning roll

15:51.461 --> 15:53.080
and none of us has slept nce the funeral.

15:53.147 --> 15:54.914
Once Garcia can get us a paper trail,

15:54.949 --> 15:56.681
then we can expand our canvass. But...

15:57.241 --> 15:59.414
Untill then there's really not a lot we can do.

16:15.013 --> 16:18.314
Would you please turn the music off?

16:18.853 --> 16:21.214
But it's your favorite song.

16:26.881 --> 16:28.814
How do you know that?

16:33.881 --> 16:37.347
It's the most played song on your iPod.

16:42.681 --> 16:45.581
No! No! Stop!

16:45.647 --> 16:47.547
Aah!

16:47.614 --> 16:49.681
Stop it.

16:50.614 --> 16:52.047
You're ruining it.

16:53.223 --> 16:55.581
I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

16:55.647 --> 16:59.614
Please. I'll do whatever you want.

17:01.280 --> 17:03.797
I've put a lot of time and effort

17:03.832 --> 17:06.314
into making this a special night.

17:06.380 --> 17:09.481
Is it too much to ask for a little appreciation?

17:09.547 --> 17:11.580
I'm sorry.

17:11.646 --> 17:13.012
I won't do it again.

17:13.079 --> 17:14.948
Please.

17:15.012 --> 17:17.047
I'll do whatever you want.

17:18.881 --> 17:20.980
That's ok.

17:21.047 --> 17:21.980
I forgive you.

17:23.047 --> 17:25.580
A little misunderstanding, right?

17:25.646 --> 17:27.814
Yes. That's right.

17:27.881 --> 17:31.113
I'll just forget all about this.

17:32.247 --> 17:34.948
Yes, please.

17:35.781 --> 17:38.881
Now

17:38.948 --> 17:41.614
I think it's time for your bath.

17:53.450 --> 17:54.480
Ok, Jack, listen,

17:54.515 --> 17:57.177
I want you to figure out where you want to put all your toys, ok?

17:57.212 --> 17:58.157
Ok, daddy.

17:58.192 --> 17:59.671
Alright, sweet boy.

18:10.280 --> 18:12.881
Chief Strauss, I appreciate your coming to me.

18:12.948 --> 18:14.518
Oh, of course. This isn't a time

18:14.553 --> 18:16.089
for you to be away from your son.

18:16.124 --> 18:17.236
Come in.

18:19.581 --> 18:23.013
Jack, can you say hallo to chief Strauss?

18:23.503 --> 18:24.467
Hi, Jack.

18:24.502 --> 18:27.214
Hi.

18:27.568 --> 18:28.930
Have a seat.

18:30.532 --> 18:33.815
So, how are you holding up?

18:33.850 --> 18:34.644
I'm ok.

18:34.679 --> 18:36.416
And how's Jack?

18:36.451 --> 18:38.119
He's coping.

18:38.154 --> 18:40.113
I don't think he fully understands

18:40.180 --> 18:41.913
everything that's going on.

18:41.948 --> 18:43.647
Oh, right, well, how could he?

18:45.113 --> 18:46.193
You said that there was something

18:46.228 --> 18:47.273
you wanted to discuss with me?

18:47.308 --> 18:49.178
Yes, I do.

18:56.614 --> 18:58.714
This is retirement.

18:59.204 --> 19:01.704
I've talked with the director.

19:01.739 --> 19:04.015
Given the circumstances, there's no reason

19:04.050 --> 19:07.014
you should have to return to the bureau.

19:07.049 --> 19:09.978
We can offer you full pension and benefits.

19:14.614 --> 19:17.647
Are saying that you want me to leave the BAU?

19:17.714 --> 19:20.397
Well, obviously that's your choice,

19:20.432 --> 19:23.080
but I'm offering you a way out.

19:24.252 --> 19:26.816
Agent Morgan's promotion was temporary,

19:26.851 --> 19:29.346
but he's exceeded our expectations,

19:29.381 --> 19:31.922
and I'm confident that I could make it permanent,

19:31.957 --> 19:34.171
if you decide to step down.

19:34.206 --> 19:37.914
The team would be together and you could be with your son.

19:38.980 --> 19:41.547
And when would you like a decision?

19:41.968 --> 19:44.069
I thought I would be leaving with one.

19:44.104 --> 19:45.880
What's your hesitation?

19:45.915 --> 19:49.380
I would just like to weight all of my options.

19:49.447 --> 19:52.180
Whatever you need.

19:54.010 --> 19:56.685
We believe our unsub is already with his next victim.

19:56.720 --> 19:59.361
If he matches pattern, she'll be a successful woman,

19:59.396 --> 20:02.578
probably brunette, early 30s to mid-40s.

20:02.613 --> 20:05.579
She'll be at home in Nashville's upper echelon.

20:05.614 --> 20:08.034
This means that he fits in. He drives the right car,

20:08.069 --> 20:10.454
he wears the right clothes, he's highly intelligent.

20:10.489 --> 20:12.639
He probably comes from a place of status.

20:12.674 --> 20:14.755
This guy's sociable, and he's endearing.

20:14.790 --> 20:17.270
You would never suspect that this man is capable of murder.

20:17.305 --> 20:18.744
But he will do whatever it takes

20:18.779 --> 20:20.540
to protect the fantasy that he's trying to relive.

20:20.575 --> 20:23.753
It's this fantasy which fuels his drive.

20:23.788 --> 20:25.580
He's recreating a romantic evening

20:25.615 --> 20:28.193
and repeating it with each of his victims.

20:28.228 --> 20:30.774
He most likely recently had a relationship taken away from him.

20:30.809 --> 20:32.404
So look at men who have lost loved ones

20:32.439 --> 20:33.964
or have gone through a messy divorce.

20:33.999 --> 20:37.912
But like Bundy, these women are representations of that first loss.

20:37.947 --> 20:40.792
Uh, Bundy picked victims who had similar features

20:40.827 --> 20:42.309
to the woman that abandoned him,

20:42.344 --> 20:45.247
and we believe that our unsub is doing the exact same thing.

20:45.314 --> 20:48.129
These women were confident, successful, and strong,

20:48.164 --> 20:49.323
and they fought back.

20:49.358 --> 20:52.906
Which means he has the ability to overpower them fairly easily.

20:52.941 --> 20:56.455
He believes or fantasizes he's in a relationship with these woman.

20:56.490 --> 20:59.383
No matter how fleeting the initial interaction is,

20:59.418 --> 21:02.484
it's everything to him. An invitation.

21:02.519 --> 21:05.339
Our technical analyst has compiled a list of locations

21:05.374 --> 21:07.188
that the victims visited prior to their death.

21:07.223 --> 21:09.332
These are high-class establishments.

21:09.367 --> 21:11.033
We're going to want to visit the same places.

21:11.068 --> 21:13.250
So, look for men who fit the profile,

21:13.285 --> 21:15.398
but also women who match victimology.

21:15.433 --> 21:18.255
If somebody's been paying a little too much attention to them, talk to them.

21:18.290 --> 21:21.483
Get a read, then jot their name down so that we can check them out.

21:21.518 --> 21:24.677
All right, folks, pick up your canvassing assignments and get to work.

21:24.712 --> 21:26.121
Thank you.

21:34.581 --> 21:36.807
The rain's supposed to clear up today.

21:36.842 --> 21:39.647
It's gonna be in the high 50s.

21:42.247 --> 21:46.080
What do you want to do today?

21:52.347 --> 21:56.214
There are a lot of good movies playing at the Green Hills mall.

22:00.013 --> 22:02.714
You want to go see something?

22:06.948 --> 22:10.547
Why don't we stay inside today?

22:10.614 --> 22:13.481
Maybe watch a DVD.

22:14.558 --> 22:17.481
I want to go on a real date, Joe.

22:20.614 --> 22:23.581
Hey, uh...

22:23.647 --> 22:25.163
I thought...

22:25.198 --> 22:26.976
after we made love last night,

22:27.011 --> 22:31.247
you'd realize how much you mean to me.

22:44.632 --> 22:46.814
Don't you trust me, Joe?

23:02.814 --> 23:04.280
Who's that?

23:04.315 --> 23:05.747
I have no idea.

23:10.848 --> 23:12.581
Erika?

23:13.483 --> 23:14.675
Honey, it's me!

23:14.710 --> 23:16.207
You home?

23:19.803 --> 23:22.113
Got a surprise for me, baby?

23:51.380 --> 23:52.714
Erika?

23:52.781 --> 23:55.314
Grant, help!

24:00.180 --> 24:02.881
Why do you have a key?

24:04.490 --> 24:05.711
Run!

24:09.814 --> 24:10.185
Aah!

24:10.220 --> 24:12.642
Get upstairs! Go, go, go, go, go!

24:12.677 --> 24:14.113
Grant! Grant!

24:14.180 --> 24:17.314
Why-- do-- you-- have-- a-- key?!

24:17.380 --> 24:20.080
No! Grant! Aah!

24:20.147 --> 24:21.897
No! Grant! No!

24:21.932 --> 24:24.147
Hey, Erika, sweetie

24:27.347 --> 24:29.736
why did he have a key?

24:32.028 --> 24:33.906
Why did he have a key?

24:48.737 --> 24:50.703
House belongs to an Erika Silverman,

24:50.738 --> 24:53.130
project director in an international design firm.

24:53.165 --> 24:54.502
We're assuming the male victim

24:54.537 --> 24:55.839
is her boyfriend Grant Franklin.

24:55.874 --> 24:57.041
- Male victim?
- Mm-Hmm.

24:57.076 --> 24:58.173
They're both pretty beat up.

24:58.208 --> 25:00.093
We'll need dental records for a positive ID.

25:00.128 --> 25:00.772
Who called it in?

25:00.807 --> 25:03.044
UPS guy. Needed her to sign for a package,

25:03.079 --> 25:05.281
the door was wide open. We got him out back.

25:05.316 --> 25:06.614
JJ, talk to him.

25:06.681 --> 25:08.714
Where's Erika Silverman's body?

25:08.781 --> 25:10.814
He changed his MO.

25:10.881 --> 25:13.714
Multiple stab wounds to the face and neck.

25:13.781 --> 25:14.914
Classic overkill.

25:14.980 --> 25:17.257
And evidence that she had sex before she died.

25:17.292 --> 25:18.562
Forced or consensual?

25:18.597 --> 25:20.848
No evidence of sexual assault.

25:20.914 --> 25:23.113
She played along.

25:23.539 --> 25:24.844
She had sex th the unsub

25:24.879 --> 25:26.718
because she thought it would keep her alive.

25:26.753 --> 25:28.372
So why didn't it?

25:28.407 --> 25:30.709
This kill is personal, angry.

25:30.744 --> 25:33.022
She didn't give him everything that he wanted.

25:33.057 --> 25:36.013
What else does he want?

25:40.581 --> 25:44.047
The dinner dishes are washed, but the breakfast plates aren't.

25:44.113 --> 25:45.708
He didn't clean up this time.

25:45.743 --> 25:48.260
The boyfriend must have surprised him and disrupted his routine.

25:48.295 --> 25:50.561
I don't know, I'd say he came pretty close to finishing it.

25:50.596 --> 25:52.827
It looks like they watched a movie, had an early breakfast.

25:52.862 --> 25:55.781
She was with him all night.

25:57.126 --> 25:58.003
Hey, Garcia.

25:58.038 --> 25:59.139
<i>Bad news, buttercup.</i>

25:59.174 --> 26:00.206
Great. What is it?

26:00.241 --> 26:02.380
No payoff on the social networng sites,

26:02.415 --> 26:03.936
and this Erika Silverman person

26:03.971 --> 26:06.200
does not leave a breadcrumb-like trail.

26:06.235 --> 26:08.394
<i>Aside from a couple of online purchases</i>

26:08.429 --> 26:11.280
and some automatic debits, she hasn't used her credit card all week.

26:11.347 --> 26:13.734
All right. Thanks.

26:16.647 --> 26:19.478
Hey. So, Garcia couldn't find anything about Erika Silverman's

26:19.513 --> 26:21.063
whereabouts over the past week.

26:21.098 --> 26:22.774
No stores, no restaurants, nothing.

26:22.809 --> 26:24.415
There may actually be another way

26:24.450 --> 26:25.987
to figure out where she's been.

26:26.022 --> 26:27.951
Do we know where any of the victims' cars are?

26:27.986 --> 26:29.646
As far as I know, they're in impound.

26:29.681 --> 26:31.271
We need access to all four of them.

26:31.306 --> 26:33.321
- Four?
- We should also get Grant Franklin's car.

26:33.356 --> 26:36.262
He may have driven Erika somewhere where she met the unsub.

26:43.814 --> 26:45.993
There has to be something in the victimology.

26:46.028 --> 26:48.173
If Grant Franklin hadn't come home when he did,

26:48.208 --> 26:50.330
Erika would probably still be alive.

26:50.365 --> 26:52.379
So how did the unsub miss him?

26:52.414 --> 26:54.371
It says he was out of town last week

26:54.406 --> 26:56.385
visiting family in Indianapolis.

26:56.420 --> 26:58.175
Still, the violence of those kills

26:58.210 --> 26:59.895
indicates he knew both victims.

26:59.930 --> 27:02.565
'Cause the longer victims are with the killer,

27:02.600 --> 27:04.407
the more desperate the attack.

27:04.442 --> 27:07.579
The unsub stabbed Erika Silverman 17 times in the face,

27:07.614 --> 27:10.180
Grant Franklin 34 times to the face and genitals.

27:10.215 --> 27:12.747
It makes sense. The more he perfects his routine,

27:12.782 --> 27:14.103
the more invested he becomes.

27:14.138 --> 27:16.057
Detective Kaminski, have your men had any luck

27:16.092 --> 27:17.941
canvassing the victims' last known whereabouts?

27:17.976 --> 27:20.647
None. I'm thinking of pulling them off for the night.

27:20.682 --> 27:21.782
That's a mistake.

27:21.817 --> 27:23.523
Why is that? The vic's dead.

27:23.558 --> 27:25.215
If he sticks to the pattern, we've got another week

27:25.250 --> 27:26.194
before he strikes again.

27:26.229 --> 27:27.902
Because he's never gotten this far before.

27:27.937 --> 27:30.447
He's desperate to ay out his fantasy.

27:30.514 --> 27:32.793
A man like this isn't gonna stick to any timetable.

27:32.828 --> 27:34.937
He's gonna try to finish this tonight.

27:34.972 --> 27:36.668
JJ, we need you on the news.

27:36.703 --> 27:39.380
Narrow victimology. Let people know that he's out there right now.

27:39.415 --> 27:41.040
I'm on it.

27:41.783 --> 27:44.162
We still don't know where he's finding his victims.

27:44.197 --> 27:48.511
But we do know that Erika Silverman lived in Green Hills.

27:48.546 --> 27:50.293
That's 3 points and we finally have

27:50.328 --> 27:52.179
our geographical comfort zone.

27:52.214 --> 27:55.085
It's a good bet the unsub lis somewhere in this area,

27:55.120 --> 27:57.956
and Erika is our key to figuring out where they met.

27:59.914 --> 28:01.730
Oh, man, pancakes for dinner.

28:01.765 --> 28:03.547
Is there anything better?

28:03.614 --> 28:05.948
Yay! No, there's not.

28:06.013 --> 28:07.547
Hey, Jack, who are these guys?

28:07.614 --> 28:10.723
This is you, and this is the bad guy.

28:10.758 --> 28:12.170
They're fighting.

28:12.205 --> 28:13.547
Who wins, Jack?

28:13.582 --> 28:18.080
Daddy. No one beats daddy.

28:18.347 --> 28:19.348
Hey, Jack.

28:19.383 --> 28:21.208
Aunt Jessica's almost got dinner ready.

28:21.243 --> 28:23.033
I forgot, what do we do before we eat?

28:23.068 --> 28:24.131
Wash our hands.

28:24.166 --> 28:25.881
Good job.

28:25.948 --> 28:27.514
Come on.

28:27.581 --> 28:30.080
Daddy.

28:30.147 --> 28:32.980
He built those himself. I hope it's ok.

28:33.047 --> 28:34.820
Of course.

28:34.855 --> 28:37.718
Listen, I really appreciate your coming over.

28:37.753 --> 28:40.581
All your help and support, it's been great.

28:40.647 --> 28:43.347
He's my nephew, and you're my family.

28:43.414 --> 28:45.980
I'll be here as much as you want.

28:52.814 --> 28:55.280
The bureau has offered me retirement.

28:56.104 --> 28:58.013
What did you tell them?

28:59.481 --> 29:02.869
You know, Jack needs me now more than ever.

29:02.904 --> 29:05.013
That means being here full-time.

29:05.080 --> 29:08.416
After Haley and I were apart, he didn't havee very much,

29:08.451 --> 29:11.752
and that was hard, but I knew that at least he had his mom

29:12.471 --> 29:15.028
and right now he really needs his dad.

29:15.063 --> 29:17.186
Of course he does, Aaron.

29:17.221 --> 29:18.720
We both know you and Haley didn't separate

29:18.755 --> 29:20.319
beuse you stopped loving each other.

29:20.354 --> 29:22.681
Your job just got in the way.

29:22.747 --> 29:24.015
Your team needed you,

29:24.050 --> 29:27.447
and despite this offer, I doubt that's changed.

29:27.514 --> 29:29.848
Maybe you don't need to retire.

29:30.289 --> 29:35.714
What if I stayed with Jack when you had to be away?

29:36.848 --> 29:38.447
Jessica, I appreciate that.

29:38.514 --> 29:40.380
Please...

29:40.447 --> 29:44.547
It would mean a lot to me if you'd let me help you out with Jack.

29:46.223 --> 29:48.681
For Haley.

29:55.664 --> 29:57.447
Garcia's got something.

29:57.843 --> 29:59.796
<i>I'm a real genius 'cause this is what I did.</i>

29:59.831 --> 30:01.714
<i>I took the travel logs from the GPS sysms,</i>

30:01.749 --> 30:04.003
<i>overlaid their routes against the geographical profile</i>

30:04.038 --> 30:06.321
<i>to reveal what the paper trail could not.</i>

30:06.356 --> 30:07.393
Which was?

30:07.428 --> 30:09.182
<i>While Erika Silverman is the only victim</i>

30:09.217 --> 30:10.803
<i>who didn't visit a private club,</i>

30:10.838 --> 30:12.414
<i>a concert, or go to a fancy restaurant</i>

30:12.449 --> 30:13.990
<i>in the days leading up to her death,</i>

30:14.025 --> 30:15.448
she did spend a couple of hours

30:15.483 --> 30:17.825
at Cheekwood botanical gardens on tuesday.

30:17.860 --> 30:20.545
Garcia, did either of the other victims go to the park?

30:20.580 --> 30:21.381
<i>No.</i>

30:21.416 --> 30:22.597
I don't know if it's relevant, then.

30:22.632 --> 30:25.666
<i>It is when her navigation system reads in a straight line.</i>

30:25.701 --> 30:27.129
<i>To work, back home, to work, back home.</i>

30:27.164 --> 30:29.281
<i>I don't think she ever left her house.</i>

30:29.316 --> 30:31.398
<i>She even had her groceries delivered.</i>

30:31.433 --> 30:33.614
What washe doing on tuesday?

30:33.681 --> 30:35.914
Let's find out.

30:44.309 --> 30:46.614
Where is everybody?

30:46.681 --> 30:48.315
Well, JJ and Reid are checking on a lead,

30:48.350 --> 30:51.685
and Prentiss is recanvassing with detective Kaminski.

30:52.277 --> 30:56.247
Good. Then we can talk.

30:59.647 --> 31:01.147
Rossi...

31:02.765 --> 31:04.925
It's his team.

31:04.960 --> 31:06.914
I'm not gonna stand in the way of that.

31:06.980 --> 31:08.908
It might not come to that.

31:08.943 --> 31:09.603
What do you mean?

31:09.638 --> 31:12.380
Strauss offered him retirement.

31:15.980 --> 31:17.392
He'll never accept it.

31:17.427 --> 31:19.089
Don't be so sure.

31:19.124 --> 31:21.607
This job cost him his wife.

31:21.642 --> 31:23.009
It cost him that a long time ago.

31:23.044 --> 31:26.647
Which is why he won't let it cost him his son.

31:32.314 --> 31:34.180
What do you think he'll do?

31:34.247 --> 31:36.514
It doesn't matter what I think.

31:36.581 --> 31:39.575
What matters is whether you'll be willing to step down

31:39.610 --> 31:41.715
if he comes back.

31:41.750 --> 31:44.881
Or step up if he doesn't.

31:46.247 --> 31:48.044
I'm gonna do whatever Hotch needs me to do.

31:48.079 --> 31:50.247
He's lost enough.

31:55.347 --> 31:57.080
Hey, Rossi.

31:57.147 --> 31:58.772
You mind coming here for a second?

31:58.807 --> 32:00.398
I want to throw something at you.

32:02.890 --> 32:05.714
We profiled that our unsub recently experienced a loss as well.

32:05.781 --> 32:06.616
A loved one.

32:06.651 --> 32:09.280
Probably a brunette who ran in the same circles as his victims.

32:09.315 --> 32:10.423
Right.

32:10.458 --> 32:13.043
What if love wasn't the only loss?

32:13.078 --> 32:14.888
I mean, we assumed that because our unsub

32:14.923 --> 32:16.944
could so easily navigate our victims' upscale world

32:16.979 --> 32:20.380
that he most likely shared the same financial resources as his victims.

32:20.447 --> 32:23.200
Because of his upbringing, his sophisticated behavior.

32:23.235 --> 32:25.975
But that behavior is ingrained in him.

32:26.010 --> 32:27.481
It's habit.

32:27.547 --> 32:28.965
It something he would have learned as a child,

32:29.000 --> 32:31.514
not as an adult.

32:31.581 --> 32:33.495
If he didn't have financial independence

32:33.530 --> 32:36.773
but were still trying to keep up his social status,

32:36.808 --> 32:38.250
he'd be hemorrhaging funds.

32:38.285 --> 32:40.560
We've been looking at this the wrong way, Rossi.

32:40.595 --> 32:42.551
We vetted the maids, the gardeners, the pool cleaners,

32:42.586 --> 32:44.578
anyone who had access to the houses, but

32:44.613 --> 32:47.914
who else might go unnoticed in a privileged society?

32:48.677 --> 32:49.346
<i>Garcia here.</i>

32:49.381 --> 32:51.835
Garcia, check employee records

32:51.870 --> 32:53.844
at each of the venues the victims visited

32:53.879 --> 32:55.503
in the week prior to their death.

32:55.538 --> 32:58.064
<i>Look f men spending beyond their means.</i>

32:58.099 --> 33:00.210
<i>A guy who's racked up a lot of debt, Garcia.</i>

33:00.245 --> 33:01.643
Look at cars, wardrobes,

33:01.678 --> 33:04.621
something that does not fit their current income level.

33:04.656 --> 33:07.564
A scholarship-funded private school education maybe.

33:07.637 --> 33:10.918
As you can see, the park attracts a variety of patrons.

33:10.953 --> 33:14.100
Older couples, walkers, tour groups.

33:14.135 --> 33:17.743
We'll hold an occasional wedding or concert series on our upper lawn.

33:17.778 --> 33:20.040
Did you have any events here past tuesday?

33:20.075 --> 33:25.175
Tuesday. Oh, we had a corporate fund-raiser between 4 and 7.

33:25.210 --> 33:27.551
That's when Erika Silverman was here.

33:27.586 --> 33:30.374
An event up here would be a hard sell for women in heels.

33:30.409 --> 33:32.591
Well, most of our private events hire valets

33:32.626 --> 33:34.773
to drive the cars down to the base of the park

33:34.808 --> 33:37.427
so they don't have to hiket up the hill.

33:37.462 --> 33:40.047
Who has access to your keys but goes unseen?

33:40.113 --> 33:41.380
And to your GPS.

33:41.415 --> 33:44.240
Dealerships program your home address into the navigation system

33:44.275 --> 33:46.075
before your car even leaves the lot.

33:46.110 --> 33:48.993
He had turn by turn directions straight to her front door

33:49.028 --> 33:51.747
and the keys to get him inside.

33:59.819 --> 34:01.862
Thank you, Joe.

34:18.880 --> 34:20.813
<i>Please state your desired destination.</i>

34:20.849 --> 34:24.414
Take me home.

34:35.480 --> 34:40.226
<i>Culpepper valet company handled the fund-raiser on tuesday, and</i>

34:40.262 --> 34:41.914
<i>the same company had contracts</i>

34:41.949 --> 34:44.380
with the hotel lounge Bethany Heminger frequented

34:44.447 --> 34:46.848
and the country club Melissa Johnson was a member at.

34:46.914 --> 34:49.565
- That's our connection.
- JJ, get Rossi and Prentiss to pick up the owner.

34:49.601 --> 34:51.714
Right away.

34:51.781 --> 34:53.414
All right, baby girl, talk to me.

34:53.481 --> 34:55.664
I need employee records and a list of venues

34:55.699 --> 34:57.848
that Culpepper contracted out to this weekend.

34:57.914 --> 35:00.901
<i>Oh, sug, check your email. It hit your inbox 60 seconds ago.</i>

35:00.936 --> 35:02.314
Thanks, Penelope.

35:03.514 --> 35:05.474
All right, Culpepper contracted out to 3 venues

35:05.509 --> 35:07.247
this weekend, two today.

35:07.282 --> 35:08.829
We might be able to catch this guy in action.

35:08.864 --> 35:10.781
Unless he's already with another victim.

35:11.681 --> 35:13.147
The man we're looking for

35:13.214 --> 35:16.547
would have been assigned to Cheekwood park on tuesday.

35:17.021 --> 35:19.948
Hold on, let me, uh, pull the roster.

35:21.990 --> 35:25.472
Ok, we had 6 guys at that site on that day.

35:25.507 --> 35:28.839
He would have had very few if any disciplinary citings.

35:28.874 --> 35:32.180
He's proper. He appears to have had a gentlemanly upbringing.

35:32.247 --> 35:35.314
He's a romantic. He would have talked about women

35:35.380 --> 35:36.914
and love frequently.

35:36.980 --> 35:39.288
He might have just ended a long-term relationship

35:39.323 --> 35:41.013
or lost someone close to him.

35:41.080 --> 35:43.247
Belser. Joe Belser.

35:43.314 --> 35:44.848
Him and his girl, they broke up.

35:44.914 --> 35:46.347
When was that?

35:46.414 --> 35:48.056
A few weeks ago. They were engaged.

35:48.091 --> 35:49.203
Do you know what hapned?

35:49.238 --> 35:51.926
He was head over heels in love with her.

35:51.961 --> 35:54.614
And she was sleeping with the best man.

35:57.013 --> 35:58.860
The manager said Belser picked up a shift

35:58.895 --> 36:00.714
at the Vonner street lounge.

36:01.588 --> 36:02.881
Yeah, we're headed there right now.

36:02.948 --> 36:05.113
Ok. SWAT's gonna meet us at Belser's apartment.

36:05.148 --> 36:07.243
Garcia, did you find anything else on Belser?

36:07.278 --> 36:10.102
Ok. He attended southern Charleston preparatory academy

36:10.137 --> 36:12.927
on scholarship. His parents died in a boating accident

36:12.962 --> 36:14.373
6 years ago.

36:14.408 --> 36:17.080
<i>Belser lost his inheritance in the stock market, and</i>

36:17.115 --> 36:19.210
since then, he has been racking up debt

36:19.245 --> 36:20.905
faster than he can pay it off.

36:20.940 --> 36:24.814
He was engaged to society magazine editor Rose Smith

36:24.881 --> 36:27.693
until 6 weeks ago

36:27.728 --> 36:29.347
<i>when it was called off.</i>

36:29.414 --> 36:31.681
And the chapel was already paid for.

36:31.747 --> 36:35.112
So he spent his entire savings trying to live in the world of his fiancee.

36:35.147 --> 36:37.414
She was his lifeline to the society he'd grown up in.

36:37.449 --> 36:39.681
Only to have her leave him and wind up penniless.

36:39.747 --> 36:41.279
Hey, Garcia, I don't suppose Belser's

36:41.314 --> 36:43.980
<i>car has a LoJack system on it, does it?</i>

36:44.047 --> 36:45.480
No. No such luck, boy wonder.

36:45.515 --> 36:46.914
Need potential victims' names.

36:46.980 --> 36:49.180
- We'll get back to you.
- Ok.

36:51.747 --> 36:53.047
FBI! Open up!

36:53.113 --> 36:54.314
Joe Belser, FBI!

36:54.380 --> 36:56.414
If you're in there, identify yourself!

37:02.540 --> 37:03.047
It's clear here.

37:03.589 --> 37:04.547
Clear.

37:05.948 --> 37:08.247
Hey, uh, I think I found the meaning of the rose petals.

37:08.831 --> 37:10.214
Look at these.

37:10.280 --> 37:11.380
Garage door openers?

37:11.447 --> 37:14.414
Universal garage door openers.

37:16.090 --> 37:18.481
This solves the problem of having to copy the key.

37:18.547 --> 37:20.814
Some drivers are smart enough to use a valet key,

37:20.881 --> 37:22.971
but no one thinks to take a garage door opener with them.

37:23.006 --> 37:24.814
That's how he got into Melissa Johnson's house.

37:24.881 --> 37:27.514
We only found prints on the interior garage door.

37:27.581 --> 37:29.980
We thought it was from he moved the dog into the garage.

37:30.047 --> 37:31.647
People rarely think to lock a door

37:31.714 --> 37:34.414
that lies beyond another locked door.

37:34.481 --> 37:36.881
Reid. He's not here.

37:40.447 --> 37:42.681
A beautiful brunette, late 30s, early 40s.

37:42.747 --> 37:45.881
She would have been driving a high-class SUV or sedan.

37:45.948 --> 37:47.814
She only buys high-end.

37:47.881 --> 37:49.047
No?

37:49.113 --> 37:51.414
Thank you.

37:51.481 --> 37:52.647
VIP?

37:52.714 --> 37:53.848
Definitely.

37:53.914 --> 37:56.681
Let me check the register logs.

37:56.747 --> 37:58.347
This is a list of all of our customers

37:58.414 --> 38:01.080
who made charges in our VIP section tonight.

38:01.147 --> 38:03.013
They have their own attendant.

38:03.080 --> 38:05.518
15 names. Only 6 were women.

38:05.553 --> 38:06.681
Garcia, we need you.

38:06.747 --> 38:07.106
Whatcha got?

38:07.141 --> 38:08.445
<i>All right, 6 names used credit cards</i>

38:08.480 --> 38:09.969
at the Vonner street lounge in the past 3 hours.

38:10.004 --> 38:12.032
Jennifer Ketelson, Kiegan Murphy,

38:12.067 --> 38:14.140
<i>Heather Aldridge, Meg Natraj,</i>

38:14.175 --> 38:16.214
Ann Herron, and Katie Gotshall.

38:16.280 --> 38:19.541
Ok, I'm cross-referencing the geographical profile

38:19.576 --> 38:21.387
with financial records.

38:21.422 --> 38:23.901
Oh, these 3 look good, and one a brunette.

38:23.902 --> 38:27.146
Her name is Ann Herron. She lives at 431 Pyle street.

38:27.857 --> 38:28.747
We got him.

38:35.481 --> 38:37.380
Sweetheart.

38:47.835 --> 38:49.347
Stop! No!

38:49.414 --> 38:50.814
No, no!

38:50.881 --> 38:53.000
We are going to be happy together.

38:53.035 --> 38:54.047
No!

38:56.814 --> 38:59.314
Don't you want this to work out?

38:59.768 --> 39:01.414
Ohh! Uhh!

39:01.481 --> 39:02.814
Answer me!

39:02.881 --> 39:04.080
No!

39:04.610 --> 39:05.514
Annie!

39:06.013 --> 39:08.614
I'm trying to make this a magical night!

39:08.681 --> 39:10.547
No!

39:10.614 --> 39:12.980
No!

39:17.614 --> 39:20.013
You ruined this!

39:21.848 --> 39:24.447
FBI! Put it down!

39:24.514 --> 39:26.047
Uhh!

39:27.247 --> 39:29.581
It's ok. You're gonna be ok.

39:29.647 --> 39:31.247
Fantasy's over.

39:31.314 --> 39:33.013
Is that what you did to them?

39:33.080 --> 39:34.574
You hit them to shut them up

39:34.609 --> 39:37.113
and then forced them to play along with your sick delusion?

39:38.294 --> 39:39.848
I love them.

39:41.565 --> 39:43.848
You're finally gonna meet your soul mate, Joe.

39:43.914 --> 39:45.380
In prison.

39:45.447 --> 39:47.297
Only you're not gonna be able to push him around

39:47.332 --> 39:49.414
the way you did those women.

39:49.481 --> 39:52.080
And when he comes for you

39:52.147 --> 39:54.180
in the middle of the night,

39:54.247 --> 39:55.914
when you're least expecting it,

39:55.980 --> 39:58.247
you do me a favor.

39:58.314 --> 40:00.980
Play along.

40:10.914 --> 40:12.514
How is she?

40:12.581 --> 40:14.781
She's strong. She'll make it.

40:15.301 --> 40:18.647
But you don't survive something like that without scars.

40:18.714 --> 40:21.180
Scars remind us where we've been.

40:21.768 --> 40:24.113
They don't have to dictate where we're going.

41:01.087 --> 41:03.314
I had a feeling I'd find you here.

41:09.080 --> 41:11.113
Have you told her yet?

41:11.934 --> 41:13.447
Told her what?

41:16.645 --> 41:18.814
That you're coming back to the team.

41:20.205 --> 41:24.848
That fighting the bad guys is who you are.

41:29.226 --> 41:30.781
I don't have to tell her.

41:33.347 --> 41:35.881
She already knows.

41:46.714 --> 41:49.578
"What lies behind us and at lies before us

41:49.613 --> 41:53.714
are tiny matters compared what lies within us."

41:53.781 --> 41:56.747
Ralph Waldo Emerson.
