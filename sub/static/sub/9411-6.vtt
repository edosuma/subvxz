[ Mimi ] 
 The boys will never have to be apart.

15:04.120 --> 15:07.200
[ Dahlia ] Nobody's getting 
 married until you pay my fee.

15:07.680 --> 15:10.200
- Then we'll talk. 
 - Oh, well.

15:10.200 --> 15:14.480
Don't worry about that. 
 They're so delicious.

15:14.480 --> 15:16.600
[ Mimi ] 
 I'll write you a check right now.

15:22.760 --> 15:24.200
[ Door Closing ]

15:24.200 --> 15:27.200
Jon, is that you?

15:27.680 --> 15:31.000
- Are you all right? 
 - Fine, thanks.

15:31.400 --> 15:34.440
- Where are you going? 
 - Into the kitchen to make snacks.

15:34.440 --> 15:36.600
You don't have to do that. 
 I'll get it.

15:37.080 --> 15:39.320
Oh, no. 
 You've done too much already.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.800
You visit with your friends 
 while Tom and I go in the kitchen

15:42.800 --> 15:44.240
and do something for you.

15:45.680 --> 15:47.800
[ Clock Ticking ]

15:50.280 --> 15:52.520
Tom, come on.

15:52.520 --> 15:54.440
Coming.

15:59.920 --> 16:00.920
What's to eat?

16:00.920 --> 16:03.400
Forget that. 
 We have to get out of here.

16:03.400 --> 16:04.920
Oh, I'm hungry.

16:07.920 --> 16:12.400
Ooh. I hate being old. 
 I can't eat anything.

16:12.920 --> 16:16.400
Listen. 
 Mimi and Lillian wanna marry us.

16:16.920 --> 16:20.200
So? Why fight it?

16:20.200 --> 16:23.120
- We have to get out of here. 
 - Too tired.

16:23.120 --> 16:25.160
All I want is something I can eat.

16:25.160 --> 16:27.160
Baby food? 
 What's that doing here?

16:27.160 --> 16:29.160
You know Mom.

16:29.160 --> 16:31.840
She gets weird cravings 
 when she's pregnant.

16:31.840 --> 16:36.360
- At least it won't hurt my teeth. 
 - What? We need a plan.

16:36.360 --> 16:39.520
[ Mimi ] 
 Boys. Tom, Jon.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.040
- What's taking so long? 
 - Uh...

16:43.040 --> 16:44.800
Good snacks take time.

16:48.600 --> 16:51.120
Oh, we have to think of 
 some way to stop them.

16:51.120 --> 16:54.320
Hey, Jon, this baby food 
 is pretty good.

16:58.240 --> 17:00.760
Tom, you're getting younger.

17:02.720 --> 17:04.720
Baby food.

17:05.599 --> 17:09.560
Your face. 
 That must be the antidote.

17:09.560 --> 17:13.720
- Give me some of that. 
 - We're coming in to help you.

17:14.200 --> 17:18.119
- [ Jon ] No, uh, that's all right. 
 - But we want to.

17:18.599 --> 17:20.280
We insist.

17:21.200 --> 17:23.160
- Quick, lock the door. 
 - Uh-huh.

17:23.160 --> 17:24.079
- Stop them from coming in. 
 - OK.

17:24.720 --> 17:26.640
[ Lillian ] 
 You know you can't resist us.

17:27.160 --> 17:29.160
Don't even try.

17:29.640 --> 17:33.360
She'll feed us those prunes 
 and make us old again.

17:33.360 --> 17:35.480
[ Dahlia ] 
 1, 2, 3.

17:36.160 --> 17:37.600
[ All Shouting ]

17:39.600 --> 17:43.160
[ Mimi Screaming ] 
 Oh, no!

17:43.160 --> 17:47.640
- What happened to them? 
 - Mimi, grab the baby food.

17:48.160 --> 17:51.600
Lillian, stand by with 
 the emergency prune juice.

17:51.600 --> 17:52.350
OK.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.800
[ Mimi ] 
 Lillian, help me.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.160
They'll be old again in no time.

17:57.160 --> 17:57.910
No!

18:00.200 --> 18:02.040
Tom, catch.

18:09.160 --> 18:13.880
- No more antidote now. 
 - Get away from me.

18:13.880 --> 18:19.200
Don't fight it, Tom. 
 You know you love prunes.

18:19.200 --> 18:23.480
- Never. 
 - We'll take good care of you boys, really.

18:33.640 --> 18:35.520
Not the prune juice.

18:37.360 --> 18:38.880
[ Screaming ]

18:41.000 --> 18:43.520
Throw the baby food.

18:45.440 --> 18:47.320

18:59.400 --> 19:00.920
Now...

19:00.920 --> 19:04.320
Uh, nice to have met you. 
 We must be going.

19:04.320 --> 19:07.760
Yes, uh, we're late for Bingo, 
 across town.

19:07.760 --> 19:10.240
- [ Lillian ] Bye-bye. 
 - [ Mimi ] Bye, boys.

19:14.240 --> 19:15.240

 Hello.

Hi, Mom. 
 Sorry to interrupt your vacation.

19:17.240 --> 19:19.760
- How are you guys? 
 - Oh, we're fine. Really.

19:19.760 --> 19:20.760
How's your Aunt Dahlia?

19:20.760 --> 19:24.240
Aunt Dahlia's, um, showin' us 
 a good old time.

19:25.240 --> 19:27.240
- You wanna speak to Jon? 
 - Yeah, let me say hello.

Oh, no.

Um...

19:50.800 --> 19:53.520
Listen, Mom. 
 I-I've got to go.

19:53.520 --> 19:56.600
There's a small problem 
 I need to take care of.

19:56.600 --> 20:00.120
See you tonight? 
 Great. Bye.

20:02.600 --> 20:05.280
Where did you find 
 another jar of baby food?

[ Baby Crying ]

20:13.800 --> 20:16.840
I'm coming. 
 I'll be right there.
