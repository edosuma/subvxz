WEBVTT

00:36.333 --> 00:37.709
Sweetheart, it's just me.

00:37.792 --> 00:40.333
You shouldn't sneak up on me
like that when I'm writing.

00:40.417 --> 00:41.750
Let me have a peek.

00:41.834 --> 00:44.417
I thought you said you
were
going to your lecture.

00:44.500 --> 00:46.375
I wanted to see my wife
before I go.

00:46.458 --> 00:48.667
Give my new bride
a kiss goodbye.

00:50.583 --> 00:53.417
Honey. Dan, stop.

00:53.500 --> 00:55.333
Rachel hasn't
gone
to bed yet.

00:55.417 --> 00:58.083
Look it.
Now I have hair like mommy's!

01:01.542 --> 01:04.083
Rachel, sweetie,
you have beautiful
hair.

01:04.166 --> 01:06.583
Red hair runs in your family,
doesn't it, Nancy?

01:06.667 --> 01:09.583
- Really, mommy?
- My mother had red hair.

01:09.667 --> 01:11.750
But yours is even prettier.

01:11.834 --> 01:13.291
Where is she?

01:14.458 --> 01:16.291
In heaven, sweetheart.

01:16.375 --> 01:18.166
She died when I was a baby.

01:18.250 --> 01:19.375
'But guess what?'

01:19.458 --> 01:21.250
I think
it's somebody's
bedtime.

01:21.333 --> 01:23.792
Go with Annette. I'll be
up
in a minute to say
goodnight.

01:31.250 --> 01:32.333
Did you hear that?

01:32.417 --> 01:35.458
Oh. Nancy,
we've talked about this.

01:35.542 --> 01:38.000
I'm telling you I keep
hearing
these noises, Dan.

01:38.083 --> 01:39.500
It's an old house, Nance.

01:39.583 --> 01:42.333
I think they're
coming
from the attic.

01:42.417 --> 01:45.208
There are no monsters
in the attic, I promise.

01:46.500 --> 01:48.083
You know, you should save
all that imagination

01:48.166 --> 01:49.500
for your writing.

01:49.583 --> 01:51.709
I don't know how you hear
anything with the racket

01:51.792 --> 01:53.458
that typewriter
makes anyway.

01:53.542 --> 01:56.166
None of it's any good.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.333
Give yourself a chance.

01:58.417 --> 02:01.417
And promise me you won't let
a few bumps scare you?

02:34.083 --> 02:36.375
What's up
with Cyndi Lauper?

02:36.458 --> 02:38.083
(Lilly)
'Can we help you
with something?'

02:38.166 --> 02:40.041
You're all like,
the cops that investigate

02:40.125 --> 02:41.792
really old murder cases, right?

02:41.875 --> 02:43.667
Detectives, actually.

02:43.750 --> 02:46.750
- Rush, Valens.
- My name's Liza.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.583
I have something
I want to show you.

02:49.667 --> 02:52.458
My grandma Nancy Patterson
was found hung

02:52.542 --> 02:54.250
in her attic in 1962.

02:54.333 --> 02:55.542
A suicide.

02:55.625 --> 02:57.250
That's what everyone said
but the people

02:57.333 --> 03:00.250
that live in the house now
are renovating the upstairs

03:00.333 --> 03:04.250
and they found this note.

03:04.333 --> 03:07.500
"I must end it,
my dearest, my
butterfly.

03:07.583 --> 03:09.625
'"Only in death
will I find peace.'

03:09.709 --> 03:13.709
I hope in time
you'll forgive
me."

03:13.792 --> 03:15.417
It's a suicide note.

03:15.500 --> 03:17.709
But that's not
my grandma's handwriting.

03:17.792 --> 03:22.667
Grandma Nancy wrote on the back
of all of our old photos. Look.

03:22.750 --> 03:24.166
You guys can test it,
can't you?

03:24.250 --> 03:25.959
You have special instruments
or something?

03:26.041 --> 03:27.583
What about your parents?

03:27.667 --> 03:29.125
They think
your grandmother wrote
this?

03:29.208 --> 03:32.166
My mom doesn't like me
to talk about Grandma Nancy.

03:32.250 --> 03:34.750
She was only five
when she died.

03:34.834 --> 03:37.333
Tough to lose a
parent
at that age.

03:37.417 --> 03:39.792
It's like she never
got over it.

03:39.875 --> 03:41.291
Well, we'll take a look.

03:42.208 --> 03:43.542
No promises.

03:43.625 --> 03:44.792
Thank you.

03:48.542 --> 03:51.208
I ain't an expert
but the handwriting

03:51.291 --> 03:52.542
don't look
the same to me.

03:52.625 --> 03:56.083
The note definitely
sounds
like a goodbye.

03:56.166 --> 03:59.208
If Nancy didn't write it,
who did?

04:34.041 --> 04:35.291
Questioned documents
confirmed handwriting

04:35.375 --> 04:37.458
on the suicide note
wasn't Nancy's.

04:37.542 --> 04:39.834
Well, strangulation could have
happened before the hanging.

04:39.917 --> 04:41.000
Note tell us anything else?

04:41.083 --> 04:42.250
There's no latent prints

04:42.333 --> 04:44.166
but the date of the paper
checked out.

04:44.250 --> 04:47.125
It said, the note's at
least
30, 40 years old.

04:47.208 --> 04:49.542
Nancy's daughter
Rachel Patterson found the
body.

04:49.625 --> 04:52.959
Had a bad dream that night.
Went looking for her mom.

04:53.041 --> 04:55.458
Hell of a thing living
with that your whole life.

04:55.542 --> 04:56.834
Nancy's husband
Daniel Patterson

04:56.917 --> 04:58.375
was working late
when it happened.

04:58.458 --> 05:00.875
- Professor Daniel Patterson?
- Are you familiar?

05:00.959 --> 05:02.875
Patterson was a state
Poet Laureate.

05:02.959 --> 05:05.792
I take it that means
he was good?

05:05.875 --> 05:08.500
"Hollow.
No escape from the dark.

05:08.583 --> 05:11.542
I sit alone.
In empty rooms."

05:11.625 --> 05:14.834
I hadn't really pegged you
as a poetry type, boss.

05:14.917 --> 05:17.041
Well, not me.
The ex-wife.

05:17.125 --> 05:20.250
I thought poetry
was supposed to rhyme.

05:20.333 --> 05:23.041
A-apparently, he's still
giving lectures

05:23.125 --> 05:26.208
as a professor emeritus of
literature at Powell
University.

05:26.291 --> 05:27.709
Where he met Nancy.

05:27.792 --> 05:30.041
- One of his students?
- Try secretary.

05:30.125 --> 05:32.625
Her first husband died
in a car crash.

05:32.709 --> 05:35.083
Left Nancy with a kid
to support on her own.

05:35.166 --> 05:37.041
Nancy married Patterson in '61.

05:37.125 --> 05:38.417
Went back to being a homemaker.

05:38.500 --> 05:39.917
He had a much bigger house.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.250
Daniel Patterson told police

05:41.333 --> 05:43.417
his wife started acting paranoid

05:43.500 --> 05:45.625
shortly after they moved in.

05:45.709 --> 05:47.750
Anybody benefit
from Nancy's death?

05:47.834 --> 05:49.917
There was no life
insurance,
no inheritance.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.417
No leads.

05:51.500 --> 05:53.750
Well, have a talk with
the husband. The daughter too.

05:53.834 --> 05:55.542
'Maybe they can shed
some light.'

06:00.333 --> 06:03.375
Liza shouldn't have
bothered you about this.

06:03.458 --> 06:04.834
It's what we do.

06:06.458 --> 06:09.208
Well, my mother killed
herself
long time ago.

06:09.291 --> 06:10.959
Oh, there's a chance she didn't.

06:11.041 --> 06:15.250
A chance? So you don't know
for certain then?

06:15.333 --> 06:16.792
Mom, at least look
at the note.

06:16.875 --> 06:18.375
I've seen the note, Liza.

06:18.458 --> 06:20.625
It changes nothing.

06:20.709 --> 06:22.917
I-I'm sorry, but I don't
see the point.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.041
Well, losing your mom
like that, hard to accept.

06:26.125 --> 06:29.083
But I did
and I've moved
on.

06:31.875 --> 06:34.917
Honey, you shouldn't be here.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.625
Mom, come on.

06:43.709 --> 06:45.959
Ah, your daughter
just wants to
help.

06:46.041 --> 06:50.542
Detective, my mother
was very disturbed

06:50.625 --> 06:53.834
and I've had to accept that
whatever made her that way..

06:55.542 --> 06:56.917
...might be in us.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.250
You and Liza, you mean.

06:59.333 --> 07:03.583
I made it past
my 27th birthday.

07:03.667 --> 07:04.792
What about my daughter?

07:04.875 --> 07:06.834
It's the age your
mother
was when she died.

07:06.917 --> 07:11.041
Everybody assumes
that I want to, bury this..

07:12.250 --> 07:15.000
...but I have
to live with it every day.

07:15.083 --> 07:16.375
And your stepdad?

07:16.458 --> 07:17.750
Daniel?

07:17.834 --> 07:20.750
He, uh, sent me off
to a boarding school

07:20.834 --> 07:23.250
as soon as I was old enough.

07:23.333 --> 07:26.166
I think probably because
I reminded him of her.

07:26.250 --> 07:28.542
So it was just the three of
you
in the house mostly?

07:28.625 --> 07:32.458
No, Daniel was away a lot
trying to meet a deadline

07:32.542 --> 07:34.333
for his book or lecture--

07:34.417 --> 07:36.959
Then it was just you alone
with your mom that night?

07:37.041 --> 07:38.875
Yeah, we were alone a lot.

07:41.125 --> 07:45.333
But she was always
hearing strange sounds.

07:48.625 --> 07:52.500
(Nancy)
'One, two, three'

07:52.583 --> 07:57.041
'four, five, six'

07:57.125 --> 08:01.625
'seven, eight, nine.'

08:01.709 --> 08:04.291
'Ten. Ready or not,
here I come!'

08:07.959 --> 08:10.959
'I can hear you!'

08:11.041 --> 08:13.542
'Rachel, are you
in the attic?'

08:13.625 --> 08:17.625
'I told you I don't want you
going in the attic.'

08:19.125 --> 08:20.083
Rachel?

08:24.208 --> 08:25.500
Rachel?

08:28.500 --> 08:31.417
Oh, sweetie,
what are you doing in here?

08:31.500 --> 08:32.542
You could suffocate.

08:32.625 --> 08:34.709
I wanted a good
place to hide!

08:34.792 --> 08:37.291
I don't want you
coming up here anymore.

08:37.375 --> 08:39.000
- Promise me.
- Why, mommy?

08:43.291 --> 08:44.625
Come on. Let's go.

08:55.333 --> 08:56.709
What's wrong, mommy?

08:58.417 --> 09:01.458
- What's wrong, mommy?
- Shh, shh, shh.

09:01.542 --> 09:04.959
Shh! There's someone out there.

09:05.041 --> 09:07.792
- Mommy, I'm scared.
- Hush, shh, shh, shh.

09:15.500 --> 09:17.125
Who's out there, mommy?

09:19.041 --> 09:21.500
- No one.
- Who locked it?

09:21.583 --> 09:25.458
Oh, um, the door
must have jammed. That's
all.

09:25.542 --> 09:28.583
Uh, it's okay,
sweetie.
Come here.

09:30.250 --> 09:32.208
Mommy's just out of sorts.

09:32.291 --> 09:35.500
But we're okay.
We're okay. No one's here.

09:48.208 --> 09:49.375
Someone was in the house?

09:49.458 --> 09:51.250
No, I think
that she probably

09:51.333 --> 09:54.125
knocked the vase over
before she went in.

09:54.208 --> 09:56.250
- I'm late for--
- Someone was in your house.

09:56.333 --> 09:57.583
I've got a deadline.

09:57.667 --> 09:59.166
Maybe someone who had a
problem
with your mother.

09:59.250 --> 10:01.125
A grudge,
an argument maybe.

10:01.208 --> 10:03.208
I told you, detective.

10:03.291 --> 10:05.834
The problem
was in my mother's head.

10:05.917 --> 10:08.333
Look, I know it's hard,
Rachel.
You think back--

10:08.417 --> 10:12.083
Thanks for your time,
Rachel. We'll be in
touch.

10:12.166 --> 10:15.458
Yeah. I can't change
what my mother did.

10:15.542 --> 10:16.709
That's the past.

10:18.166 --> 10:19.792
Let it stay there.

10:29.542 --> 10:31.125
For years I've searched
for an explanation.

10:31.208 --> 10:34.583
Something that'd make sense.
Nothing ever did till now.

10:34.667 --> 10:36.625
(Miller)
'You said Nancy had been
acting a little paranoid.'

10:36.709 --> 10:40.583
No one had a word for what
was happening to Nancy then..

10:40.667 --> 10:41.750
...or a cure.

10:41.834 --> 10:44.041
Electroshock therapy,
lobotomies?

10:44.125 --> 10:48.166
Huh, it was seen
as shameful, insanity.

10:48.250 --> 10:50.709
Gotta ask, professor,
but maybe that someone

10:50.792 --> 10:52.542
she was afraid of was you.

10:54.417 --> 10:57.667
I loved my wife.
I didn't kill her.

10:57.750 --> 11:00.208
Plus, I was never
around, really.

11:00.291 --> 11:03.041
I was on the deadline.
Spent all my nights here.

11:03.125 --> 11:04.709
Deadline for this book?

11:04.792 --> 11:08.250
My collection of poetry,
"Empty Rooms."

11:08.333 --> 11:10.291
'It was going
to be my gift to her.'

11:10.375 --> 11:14.333
My...attempt
to capture her spirit.

11:14.417 --> 11:16.959
See the world
through her eyes.

11:17.041 --> 11:19.166
She died before
it was published.

11:21.083 --> 11:23.250
Such a fool..

11:23.333 --> 11:26.041
...spending my time writing
about the woman I loved

11:26.125 --> 11:28.834
instead of being with her.

11:28.917 --> 11:32.125
Sounds like Nancy spent
a lot of time home alone.

11:32.208 --> 11:34.000
That's why I hired Annette.

11:35.625 --> 11:36.750
(Miller)
'Annette?'

11:36.834 --> 11:38.000
Our housekeeper.

11:38.083 --> 11:39.542
Annette have keys
to the house?

11:39.625 --> 11:40.959
Yes.

11:41.041 --> 11:43.041
She's the only one
outside the family who did.

11:43.125 --> 11:44.583
The attic, too?

11:44.667 --> 11:48.583
- Yes, but you don't think--
- We'll need her last name.

11:49.875 --> 11:52.667
Also, a sample
of your
handwriting.

11:52.750 --> 11:54.458
Of course.

11:54.542 --> 11:56.166
'It sounds strange'

11:56.250 --> 12:00.542
somehow knowing
she didn't do it herself..

12:02.542 --> 12:04.041
...is a relief.

12:07.834 --> 12:10.333
Nancy had been so blessed.

12:10.417 --> 12:13.792
Hard to believe someone
wanting to hurt her.

12:13.875 --> 12:16.625
You had been working for the
Patterson's for several
months.

12:16.709 --> 12:19.375
Yes, I started shortly
after they were married.

12:19.458 --> 12:22.750
And you had keys
to the house, the
attic?

12:22.834 --> 12:24.792
Really now,
you don't think

12:24.875 --> 12:27.583
I had something to do
with what happened?

12:28.542 --> 12:30.709
Professor Patterson
trusted me.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.000
And you respected him.

12:32.083 --> 12:34.125
Oh, he was a gentleman. Kind.

12:34.208 --> 12:36.667
Sure you weren't
holding
a torch, Annette?

12:36.750 --> 12:42.000
Huh, Professor Patterson
only had eyes for his wife.

12:42.083 --> 12:43.667
She was a beautiful woman.

12:43.750 --> 12:46.291
- Full of life.
- Until she started
slipping.

12:46.375 --> 12:50.458
- That's what they all
believed.
- Not you, Annette?

12:50.542 --> 12:54.709
There was one incident that
I had trouble explaining away.

12:59.917 --> 13:01.000
Ma'am?

13:01.083 --> 13:03.917
The page I typed last
night,
it was right here.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.709
It was in my typewriter.

13:06.792 --> 13:09.667
You're sure Rachel hasn't
been playing with my
things?

13:09.750 --> 13:11.834
I'm sure, Mrs. Patterson.

13:11.917 --> 13:13.250
I put Rachel to bed.

13:13.333 --> 13:14.959
I should be going now.

13:15.917 --> 13:17.458
Goodnight.

13:20.417 --> 13:21.959
Wait, Annette!

13:25.667 --> 13:26.917
'Annette!'

13:28.208 --> 13:29.875
Did you lock all
the windows and doors?

13:29.959 --> 13:31.709
Of course.

13:31.792 --> 13:33.834
- The back door, too?
- Yes.

13:36.792 --> 13:37.917
Did you feel that?

13:38.000 --> 13:39.583
That breeze?

13:53.000 --> 13:54.500
Oh, my God.

13:58.667 --> 14:01.542
I don't understand.
I locked everything.

14:01.625 --> 14:02.875
'Mrs. Patterson?'

14:02.959 --> 14:05.083
"Death lurks in the
corners
of your past

14:05.166 --> 14:08.041
leaving her marks
about your neck"

14:16.166 --> 14:18.959
Drummond. That name
mean anything to you?

14:19.041 --> 14:20.625
First time I ever heard it.

14:20.709 --> 14:23.291
Long time ago. Maybe,
your memory's a little
fuzzy.

14:23.375 --> 14:26.750
My memory's sharp
as a tack. Thank you.

14:26.834 --> 14:29.083
'Sounds like whoever
this Drummond was'

14:29.166 --> 14:31.250
he was obsessed with Nancy.

14:31.333 --> 14:32.834
There was a man once

14:32.917 --> 14:36.625
parked out in front of the
house
in a brown woodie.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.291
A station wagon.

14:38.375 --> 14:39.625
Buick, I think.

14:39.709 --> 14:42.375
He was just sitting there,
staring up at the study.

14:42.458 --> 14:44.125
You never mentioned this.

14:44.208 --> 14:46.709
Well, everybody said
she killed herself.

14:46.792 --> 14:48.709
So, why would I?

14:48.792 --> 14:50.583
(Stillman)
'Any leads on a brown
station wagon?'

14:50.667 --> 14:52.500
(Vera)
Well, according to the DMV
there were at least

14:52.583 --> 14:54.792
a hundred of them
in the city in '62.

14:54.875 --> 14:56.166
Any of them
belong to a Drummond?

14:56.250 --> 14:57.750
Nope, and the only
Drummond we found

14:57.834 --> 15:00.458
was a 98 year old
man
in a rest home.

15:00.542 --> 15:02.500
But we did find this.

15:02.583 --> 15:05.291
Brown Buick station wagon
was issued a speeding
ticket

15:05.375 --> 15:07.375
not more than two blocks
from Nancy's house.

15:07.458 --> 15:10.333
(Vera)
'Turns out, Speedy was
one of Patterson's students.'

15:10.417 --> 15:11.834
A Bruce Davies.

15:11.917 --> 15:14.208
We thought this Bruce
might
be connected to Drummond.

15:14.291 --> 15:16.166
A nickname,
another student maybe.

15:16.250 --> 15:18.792
Took a look at some yearbooks
and school newspapers.

15:18.875 --> 15:19.959
Found this.

15:20.041 --> 15:21.500
Picture from
the spring social.

15:21.583 --> 15:23.750
(Vera)
'Bruce Davies with
his sweetheart Nancy.'

15:23.834 --> 15:25.250
'Nancy married
Daniel Patterson'

15:25.333 --> 15:27.333
less than a year
after this was
taken.

15:27.417 --> 15:29.250
Ol' Bruce got
the heave-ho.

15:29.333 --> 15:31.333
A scorned lover
turned stalker.

15:40.917 --> 15:42.041
Philly Homicide.

15:42.125 --> 15:44.500
We'd like to talk
with Bruce Davies.

15:44.583 --> 15:46.291
- Are you Mrs. Davies?
- Me?

15:46.375 --> 15:47.750
No. Name's Belle.

15:47.834 --> 15:50.500
I might've been somebody's wife
if the job paid better.

15:50.583 --> 15:51.583
I work here.

15:51.667 --> 15:53.458
Help out with the cooking
and cleaning.

15:53.542 --> 15:54.875
Something tells me
you haven't always

15:54.959 --> 15:56.458
been cooking
and cleaning.

15:56.542 --> 15:59.083
I spent a lot of good
years dancing, too.

15:59.166 --> 16:00.875
(Vera)
'I'll bet.'

16:00.959 --> 16:03.500
Still know how to bring
a smile to a man's face.

16:04.709 --> 16:06.125
Talkin' about
my cooking, of course.

16:06.208 --> 16:09.125
- Of course.
- This way.

16:17.709 --> 16:20.125
Police wanna have a word
with you, Mr. Davies.

16:20.208 --> 16:21.500
The police?

16:23.208 --> 16:25.750
Make a mean apple pie.

16:25.834 --> 16:29.208
And you look like a man
that appreciates good pie.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.000
A la mode.

16:33.083 --> 16:36.667
- What is this about?
- Nancy Patterson. You knew
her.

16:36.750 --> 16:38.208
Haven't heard
that name in years.

16:38.291 --> 16:40.417
What about the name Drummond?
That ring any bells?

16:40.500 --> 16:42.208
No. Should it?

16:42.291 --> 16:44.917
We'll need you to come
down,
provide a writing sample.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.208
Why?

16:46.291 --> 16:48.792
Because we think Nancy
was murdered.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.250
'You two dated, right?'

16:50.333 --> 16:52.041
She was a secretary
in English Department

16:52.125 --> 16:53.834
when I was a grad student,
so what?

16:53.917 --> 16:56.333
So, she kicked you to the curb
and married Daniel.

16:56.417 --> 16:57.917
(Jeffries)
'But that wasn't
the end of it.'

16:58.000 --> 17:01.417
You sat outside in your car
for hours, pining away.

17:01.500 --> 17:04.333
I was pining away, alright,
but not for Nancy

17:04.417 --> 17:07.583
or for that dowdy
housekeeper of hers.

17:07.667 --> 17:10.458
Two down, gentlemen.
one to go.

17:11.917 --> 17:14.291
You were pining
for the husband?

17:14.375 --> 17:16.834
They didn't have a name
for that in '62.

17:17.667 --> 17:19.125
They do now.

17:20.333 --> 17:23.166
I was his lovelorn
grad student.

17:23.917 --> 17:25.166
Tragic, really.

17:25.250 --> 17:26.458
Sayin' it was a two-way street?

17:26.542 --> 17:28.875
- You and the professor?
- In my dreams.

17:28.959 --> 17:31.125
Professor Patterson
barely knew I existed.

17:31.208 --> 17:33.792
Doesn't mean you didn't kill
off the competition.

17:33.875 --> 17:35.792
I was interviewing
for a teaching post

17:35.875 --> 17:37.709
in Cincinnati
the night she died.

17:37.792 --> 17:39.750
- You can check.
- We will.

17:41.625 --> 17:44.291
I was truly sorry
when I heard about Nancy.

17:44.375 --> 17:46.125
Never believed it.

17:46.208 --> 17:48.667
- Suicide, I mean.
- Why's that?

17:48.750 --> 17:51.583
Something was going on
in that house.

17:51.667 --> 17:52.834
Something strange.

17:57.375 --> 18:01.709
Well, Bruce, my advice
is simple to a young
poet.

18:01.792 --> 18:03.625
Let nothing come
between you and the
page.

18:03.709 --> 18:06.834
Is that why you prefer writing
everything longhand, professor?

18:06.917 --> 18:08.458
'The truest connection, really.'

18:08.542 --> 18:10.917
'Because when the muse
speaks to you'

18:11.000 --> 18:12.375
she does in a whisper.

18:12.458 --> 18:13.625
Or a scream.

18:15.166 --> 18:16.750
Pardon me.

18:16.834 --> 18:18.500
I don't know
what made me say that.

18:18.583 --> 18:20.417
Could it be your muse
is a banshee?

18:20.500 --> 18:23.250
Of course, I don't
write.
Not really.

18:23.333 --> 18:24.500
Not like my husband does.

18:24.583 --> 18:27.125
Actually, Nancy
is a voracious reader.

18:27.208 --> 18:29.375
Seems she's read
nearly
every book in my
library.

18:29.458 --> 18:33.500
Oh, and somehow manages to make
delightful pigs in the blanket.

18:33.583 --> 18:35.291
I better check on Rachel.

18:35.375 --> 18:37.166
Excuse me. Please.

18:39.417 --> 18:41.750
Nancy grew up
an orphan

18:41.834 --> 18:43.750
so she got a late
start
on the great works.

18:43.834 --> 18:46.333
But it's just made her
curious
about all that she's
missed.

18:46.417 --> 18:47.750
Speaking of great works

18:47.834 --> 18:49.750
I heard that your collection
is coming out next spring.

18:49.834 --> 18:51.834
My editor paid you
to say that, didn't
he?

18:51.917 --> 18:54.083
Well, it's a good problem
to have, professor.

18:54.166 --> 18:56.750
People waiting with bated
breath for your next project.

18:56.834 --> 18:59.083
Well, don't hold your
breath
for too long.

18:59.166 --> 19:02.500
The muse can be as
unpredictable as my
wife.

19:02.583 --> 19:05.375
You'll give us a preview,
won't you? Of your collection?

19:05.458 --> 19:07.000
You're not going
to make us wait.

19:07.083 --> 19:08.375
'Well, if I shared it now'

19:08.458 --> 19:10.125
that would just
spoil
the anticipation.

19:10.208 --> 19:11.709
(Nancy)
'Daniel!'

19:12.417 --> 19:14.208
Nancy?

19:14.291 --> 19:15.917
Nancy, what's wrong?

19:19.625 --> 19:20.834
Nancy?

19:20.917 --> 19:22.000
Nancy?

19:23.959 --> 19:25.125
'Oh, hell!'

19:27.500 --> 19:28.917
Daniel.

19:36.333 --> 19:39.291
Professor Patterson asked
for me to be discreet.

19:39.375 --> 19:41.667
His wife's problems, you see.

19:41.750 --> 19:44.542
He said it must've been
a misunderstanding.

19:44.625 --> 19:46.083
Some misunderstanding.

19:46.166 --> 19:47.333
I respected him.

19:48.333 --> 19:50.041
So, I never spoke of it again.

19:52.166 --> 19:53.917
(Rush)
'Been holding out
on us, professor.'

19:54.000 --> 19:55.750
Kinda thing makes
us suspicious.

19:55.834 --> 19:57.250
What are you talking about?

19:57.333 --> 19:59.208
Hmm, forgot to,
uh, clue us in

19:59.291 --> 20:00.417
on the dinner party.

20:01.583 --> 20:03.208
The noose in the attic.

20:03.291 --> 20:05.542
This doesn't make a lot of
sense
you keepin' that quiet.

20:05.625 --> 20:07.417
- It didn't mean anything.
- 'Really?'

20:07.500 --> 20:08.875
Someone breaking
into your house

20:08.959 --> 20:11.959
stringing up a noose
...doesn't mean anything?

20:14.041 --> 20:15.667
I couldn't believe it
at the time.

20:15.750 --> 20:18.542
And after she
died?
What about then?

20:18.625 --> 20:21.458
- It only made matters worse.
- Why?

20:21.542 --> 20:23.125
Because you didn't do
anything to stop it?

20:23.208 --> 20:26.333
No. Because I believed her.

20:28.458 --> 20:31.333
- We need to go to the
police.
- And tell them what?

20:31.417 --> 20:34.583
The-there has to be some
rational explanation for
this.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.125
Someone was in our house.

20:36.208 --> 20:39.000
You saw it with your own
eyes.
What more do you want?

20:39.083 --> 20:40.333
It just doesn't make any sense.

20:40.417 --> 20:43.375
- I mean who would do a
thing--
- I don't know.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.166
I'm so scared, Daniel.

20:47.250 --> 20:49.667
You're always gone
and I'm left here
alone.

20:49.750 --> 20:53.458
- What do you expect from me?
- I expect you to believe me.

20:57.583 --> 20:58.709
I do.

21:00.333 --> 21:02.291
I'm sorry.

21:02.375 --> 21:04.917
We'll go to the police.
Together.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.208
You..

21:13.750 --> 21:15.625
Give me the keys.
I'll drive.

21:26.667 --> 21:27.959
What's the matter, Nancy?

21:34.291 --> 21:35.625
You bought rope?

21:38.417 --> 21:40.709
- I don't understand, Daniel.
- "Nancy Patterson."

21:40.792 --> 21:43.208
- Tha-that's your signature.
- I didn't. I..

21:43.291 --> 21:45.250
I-I didn't buy that.

21:50.083 --> 21:51.625
Did I?

21:56.333 --> 21:58.417
Nancy bought the rope?

22:01.000 --> 22:03.500
I wanted there
to be another explanation.

22:04.417 --> 22:06.208
And when you came to me..

22:09.375 --> 22:11.208
...I thought maybe there was.

22:21.291 --> 22:23.166
Cops had it right
the first time.

22:23.250 --> 22:24.667
Nancy did herself in.

22:27.333 --> 22:29.291
And we've been
chasing a ghost.

22:35.458 --> 22:38.083
So, we've been chasing
our tails on this one, huh?

22:38.166 --> 22:40.875
Great, 'cause I got nothin'
better to do with my time.

22:40.959 --> 22:43.417
Well, Nancy locked
herself
and Rachel in the attic

22:43.500 --> 22:44.834
put the note in
the typewriter

22:44.917 --> 22:46.417
'hung up the noose
at the party.'

22:46.500 --> 22:47.834
That's some kinda crazy.

22:47.917 --> 22:50.375
Well, maybe she went
into a fugue state.

22:50.458 --> 22:53.583
- 'Forgot she did any of
it.'
- So, that's that, huh?

22:53.667 --> 22:56.667
- Job's open and shut?
- 'Pretty much, yeah.'

22:56.750 --> 22:58.375
And what about Drummond?

22:58.458 --> 23:00.375
"Death lurks"
message he left?

23:00.458 --> 23:01.792
Looney Tunes made him up.

23:01.875 --> 23:03.625
(Jeffries)
'Hey, hey, hey, hey.'

23:05.709 --> 23:07.000
Can't you read?

23:07.083 --> 23:09.333
Since when is milk
private property?

23:09.417 --> 23:10.583
Saving it, alright?

23:10.667 --> 23:12.291
For what?

23:12.375 --> 23:14.125
Apple pie, maybe?

23:14.208 --> 23:16.792
Just keep your
hands
off of it.

23:16.875 --> 23:18.583
Most of the women
in this book..

23:18.667 --> 23:20.667
...just don't seem
like the type to leave

23:20.750 --> 23:21.917
without saying goodbye.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.458
Are you forgetting
the suicide note?

23:23.542 --> 23:26.000
It wasn't hers,
or her husband's

23:26.083 --> 23:28.625
or the housekeeper's,
or Bruce's.

23:28.709 --> 23:31.375
- So, who wrote it?
- It ain't an exact science.

23:31.458 --> 23:33.917
- Oh, that's your
explanation?
- Drop it, Scotty.

23:36.250 --> 23:38.875
It's bad enough we rocked the
boat with the family, you
know?

23:41.500 --> 23:43.291
She didn't write
that note, Nick.

23:46.500 --> 23:48.417
This isn't
about you, Scotty.

23:49.333 --> 23:50.583
'Or Elisa.'

23:55.291 --> 23:56.583
Or is it?

24:00.583 --> 24:02.542
(male #1)
'You're talking about
the woman that hung herself.'

24:02.625 --> 24:04.625
Yeah, Nancy Patterson.
You heard about her?

24:04.709 --> 24:06.166
Now, Impossible not to.

24:06.250 --> 24:08.625
Grandpa Hal told that
story
a million times.

24:08.709 --> 24:10.166
Crazy lady that
came
into the store

24:10.250 --> 24:11.834
bought the rope that
she hung herself
with.

24:11.917 --> 24:14.500
And your grandpa was the one
that sold it to her?

24:14.583 --> 24:16.750
- You sure about that?
- Yeah.

24:16.834 --> 24:19.125
- She didn't believe him.
- What do you mean?

24:19.208 --> 24:20.792
She came back in
after buying the rope

24:20.875 --> 24:22.375
asking all these
weird questions.

24:22.458 --> 24:23.834
Questions like what?

24:23.917 --> 24:25.333
Same ones you're asking now.

24:29.875 --> 24:32.709
- Excuse me.
- May I help you?

24:32.792 --> 24:34.792
My name is Nancy Patterson
and I think

24:34.875 --> 24:37.041
there's been a mistake
on my husband's account.

24:37.125 --> 24:38.333
What kind of mistake?

24:38.417 --> 24:40.542
I don't recognize
one of the charges.

24:40.625 --> 24:42.375
Oh, let's take a look.

24:44.083 --> 24:45.709
Patterson..

24:46.625 --> 24:48.041
Huh.

24:48.125 --> 24:49.417
'That's your signature, right?'

24:49.500 --> 24:52.750
- Oh, but that's impossible.
- How's that?

24:52.834 --> 24:56.709
I've never set foot in this
store until this very day.

24:56.792 --> 24:58.166
Maybe, it just
slipped
your mind.

24:58.250 --> 25:00.583
No, it didn't slip my mind!
That-that can't be!

25:00.667 --> 25:02.750
I saw you myself,
miss,
with these very eyes

25:02.834 --> 25:05.166
wearing the same hat
you're wearing now.

25:05.250 --> 25:06.667
Maybe, you just forgot.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.083
Yes.

25:11.667 --> 25:12.875
Maybe.

25:15.166 --> 25:16.667
Uh, Miss Patterson..

25:17.583 --> 25:19.166
...forgot your pen, too.

25:19.250 --> 25:20.959
Last time you were here.

25:25.333 --> 25:27.041
It is yours, right?

25:41.500 --> 25:43.917
The pen had the name
Drummond on it?

25:44.041 --> 25:46.750
Yeah. The cuckoo's nest.

25:46.834 --> 25:49.792
What? Drummond's
a mental hospital?

25:49.875 --> 25:52.542
Over in Olney.
Closed down in the '80s.

25:52.625 --> 25:55.083
My grandpa heard Mrs. Patterson
was kind of spacey

25:55.166 --> 25:57.625
but apparently she was,
you know..

25:59.208 --> 26:00.875
A week later
she was dead.

26:02.458 --> 26:03.792
(Valens)
'You were a nurse'

26:03.875 --> 26:06.291
at Drummond Mental
Hospital back in '62?

26:06.375 --> 26:09.291
Head nurse,
over 30 years.

26:09.375 --> 26:11.959
But Drummond's been
closed a long time.

26:12.041 --> 26:13.625
We tracked down
the employment records.

26:13.709 --> 26:17.875
Hoped to find someone who might
know something about this woman.

26:17.959 --> 26:20.250
'I remember her
like it was yesterday.'

26:20.333 --> 26:23.125
You...knew Nancy Patterson?

26:23.208 --> 26:25.667
No, not really.

26:25.750 --> 26:27.166
I was working the front desk

26:27.250 --> 26:30.542
when she came in, claiming
she was being followed.

26:30.625 --> 26:33.041
Even had a pen
as proof of it.

26:33.125 --> 26:36.083
- So, Nancy did visit Drummond?
- Yes, she did.

26:36.166 --> 26:37.834
We think someone associated
with the hospital

26:37.917 --> 26:39.208
might have killed her.

26:39.291 --> 26:41.333
(Miller)
'She said she was being
followed, Edna?'

26:41.417 --> 26:42.917
Yes, that's what she said.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.875
And she thought
it was a patient

26:44.959 --> 26:46.917
or someone who
worked at Drummond?

26:47.000 --> 26:51.291
The only thing following
Nancy was her past.

27:05.333 --> 27:07.709
I need to speak
to someone immediately.

27:07.792 --> 27:11.208
Someone has been following me,
pretending to be me.

27:12.917 --> 27:14.417
Do I know you?

27:16.500 --> 27:18.250
You're the
spitting
image of her.

27:18.333 --> 27:20.542
- Of-of who?
- Your mother.

27:20.625 --> 27:24.667
- What? I-I don't understand.
- I was her nurse for years.

27:24.750 --> 27:26.959
Oh, no, you must
be mistaken.

27:27.041 --> 27:29.792
Um, my mother,
she died in childbirth.

27:31.333 --> 27:33.041
You never got the note,
did you, Nancy?

27:33.125 --> 27:34.500
What note?

27:34.583 --> 27:36.083
How did you know my name?

27:36.166 --> 27:40.875
She left a note addressed
to "My dearest, my
butterfly."

27:40.959 --> 27:43.458
'I'd always assumed
that was you.'

27:43.542 --> 27:45.417
It was you,
wasn't it?

27:47.458 --> 27:49.583
What was my mother
doing here?

27:49.667 --> 27:51.625
No one told you?

27:51.709 --> 27:53.125
Told me what?

27:54.250 --> 27:56.750
T-told me what?

27:56.834 --> 27:58.125
Your mother was
a patient here.

27:58.208 --> 28:00.667
No, no, I-I told you
she died in childbirth.

28:00.750 --> 28:02.583
You were so young, Nancy,
just a little girl--

28:02.667 --> 28:05.125
You're lying!
If she's here, where?

28:05.208 --> 28:06.709
Where is she?

28:08.792 --> 28:11.792
I found her
in the storeroom one morning.

28:11.875 --> 28:13.041
No.

28:13.125 --> 28:15.333
She hung herself
from the rafters.

28:19.917 --> 28:22.000
I never should've told
her like that.

28:22.083 --> 28:23.333
I just couldn't believe

28:23.417 --> 28:25.333
she didn't know
about her own mother.

28:25.417 --> 28:27.083
Who died just like Nancy.

28:27.166 --> 28:29.041
With a noose around her neck.

28:32.166 --> 28:34.792
The suicide note Nancy's
granddaughter brought in

28:34.875 --> 28:36.792
belonged to Nancy's mother.

28:36.875 --> 28:38.834
Nancy must've took it
from the mental
hospital.

28:38.917 --> 28:41.959
She didn't. Somebody else
signed
out her mother's medical file.

28:42.041 --> 28:44.333
- Check out the signature.
- Nancy Patterson, so?

28:44.417 --> 28:45.875
That's not Nancy's handwriting.

28:45.959 --> 28:47.875
You're saying someone
forged her signature?

28:47.959 --> 28:49.667
Probably the same
somebody who forged

28:49.750 --> 28:52.166
the receipt
at the hardware
store.

28:52.250 --> 28:54.000
And guess who that was?

28:55.625 --> 28:57.166
Annette, the housekeeper.

28:57.250 --> 28:58.959
Handwriting's a perfect
match to this.

28:59.041 --> 29:00.583
Locked door,
message on the
typewriter

29:00.667 --> 29:02.750
noose in the attic.
She set it all up.

29:02.834 --> 29:04.250
One goal in mind.

29:05.375 --> 29:07.250
Drive Nancy insane.

29:11.542 --> 29:12.583
Couldn't have been easy
cleaning for a woman

29:12.667 --> 29:14.792
who had everything you didn't.

29:14.875 --> 29:17.583
Nice big house, cute kid.

29:19.333 --> 29:22.792
- Good looking husband.
- I was satisfied with my
life.

29:22.875 --> 29:24.750
(Rush)
'Alone in your
two room apartment?'

29:24.834 --> 29:28.583
Early '60s, a woman was expected
to marry, have a family.

29:28.667 --> 29:30.667
Wasn't in the
cards
for some of us.

29:30.750 --> 29:34.375
Maybe, you had your heart set
on someone in particular.

29:34.458 --> 29:35.917
I told you.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.083
Professor Patterson
was in love with his wife.

29:39.166 --> 29:40.834
But if she wasn't
in the picture..

29:40.917 --> 29:44.625
Who better to fill
her shoes...than you?

29:44.709 --> 29:46.333
He'd never think of me that way.

29:46.417 --> 29:48.834
Now, you were around
the same age, you and Nancy.

29:48.917 --> 29:50.291
From similar neighborhoods.

29:50.375 --> 29:52.125
Very little difference
between you.

29:52.208 --> 29:54.208
Except Nancy was beautiful.

29:56.291 --> 29:59.333
I don't know if I could do it,
mopping floors for a woman

29:59.417 --> 30:00.709
lucky enough to catch
a man like that.

30:00.792 --> 30:02.750
You wouldn't have to,
would you?

30:02.834 --> 30:06.542
Women like you, you take
everything for granted.

30:06.625 --> 30:07.875
Women like me?

30:07.959 --> 30:11.917
You bat your eyelashes,
smile sweet

30:12.000 --> 30:13.667
get whatever you want.

30:15.959 --> 30:18.375
Oh, everything
comes easy, right?

30:18.458 --> 30:19.709
Like it did with Nancy?

30:19.792 --> 30:21.291
'You thought you could
have her committed.'

30:21.375 --> 30:24.333
- Get her out of the way.
- Nonsense.

30:24.417 --> 30:26.208
Oh, you knew
about Drummond.

30:27.333 --> 30:28.917
I don't know that place.

30:30.291 --> 30:34.041
- Who said it was a place?
- 'Oh, you went there.'

30:34.125 --> 30:36.792
Forged her signature,
signed out her mother's file.

30:36.875 --> 30:39.417
Went to the hardware
store, too.

30:39.500 --> 30:41.250
It was for their own good.

30:41.333 --> 30:44.333
Who? Rachel? Daniel?

30:44.417 --> 30:46.375
That why you killed her?
To protect them?

30:46.458 --> 30:48.125
That woman was dangerous.

30:53.333 --> 30:55.750
Sorry, I didn't realize
you were here, ma'am.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.917
Mrs. Patterson?

30:59.000 --> 31:01.583
They put her away because
she nearly killed me.

31:03.041 --> 31:05.417
Locked me in a closet.

31:05.500 --> 31:07.250
I was seven.

31:07.333 --> 31:09.083
She left me a note.

31:09.166 --> 31:10.667
'And I just can't
help but think'

31:10.750 --> 31:13.667
is it happening to me?
Am I slipping?

31:18.875 --> 31:20.000
Where's Rachel?

31:20.083 --> 31:22.291
She woke up almost
an hour ago.

31:22.375 --> 31:25.041
Said the two of you were
gonna play hide-and-seek.

31:26.625 --> 31:28.250
Rachel, sweetie?

31:29.625 --> 31:30.792
Rachel?

31:34.333 --> 31:35.875
(Nancy)
'Rachel, sweetie?'

31:37.792 --> 31:39.542
Rachel!

31:39.625 --> 31:42.125
Rach..
Rachel!

31:44.417 --> 31:46.125
Help me!
Help me,
please!

32:02.125 --> 32:03.792
I'm so sorry.

32:09.417 --> 32:10.959
I might've done
a lot of things

32:11.041 --> 32:14.208
but I did not put
that key in her pocket.

32:14.291 --> 32:17.291
You had nothing to do with
Rachel being in that trunk?

32:17.375 --> 32:19.834
I would never hurt
that little girl.

32:19.917 --> 32:22.291
I wanted to drive
Nancy
from the house.

32:22.375 --> 32:24.458
That was all, I swear.

32:29.208 --> 32:31.542
A fragile woman
pushed to her death.

32:35.750 --> 32:37.125
Someone I gotta see.

32:47.625 --> 32:48.750
I, uh..

32:50.291 --> 32:51.875
I owe you an apology.

32:53.792 --> 32:58.166
I know...when you don't
get a goodbye..

32:58.250 --> 33:00.875
...or at least one
that makes sense..

33:00.959 --> 33:02.500
...it stays with you.

33:03.417 --> 33:05.041
It stays either way.

33:05.125 --> 33:06.834
Doesn't it, detective?

33:08.208 --> 33:09.709
Yeah.

33:09.792 --> 33:11.500
It does.

33:11.583 --> 33:15.792
I'd hoped it'd turn out
different for you.

33:15.875 --> 33:17.375
Yeah, me too.

33:22.500 --> 33:25.208
My mother did say
goodbye, you know.

33:26.667 --> 33:28.041
Oh, she did?

33:28.125 --> 33:31.250
Yeah, I just didn't
know it
at the time.

33:36.333 --> 33:38.917
- Are you crying, mommy?
- No.

33:39.000 --> 33:42.333
If you're scared,
you can sleep here with me.

33:42.417 --> 33:43.750
Oh..

33:48.166 --> 33:50.125
You are my very best
little girl.

33:50.208 --> 33:51.583
You know that, right?

33:53.500 --> 33:57.583
I'll do anything
to protect you.
Anything.

33:57.667 --> 34:01.792
And I want you to remember
that no matter what..

34:01.875 --> 34:04.542
...mommy loves you
very, very much.

34:06.333 --> 34:08.375
I love you too, mommy.

34:20.458 --> 34:21.583
Wait!

34:24.959 --> 34:26.625
Look, it for you.

34:28.417 --> 34:30.125
For me?

34:30.208 --> 34:32.750
Oh and Rachel
has red hair.

34:32.834 --> 34:34.625
Like your mommy.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.166
Rachel, where did
you get this
paper?

34:43.417 --> 34:45.583
This is the page I
was
missing. My poetry.

34:45.667 --> 34:47.875
Where did you get it?

34:47.959 --> 34:50.291
It was in daddy's things.

34:51.583 --> 34:54.000
In daddy's things?

34:54.083 --> 34:55.417
Where?

34:55.500 --> 34:57.083
In the attic.

34:59.250 --> 35:01.250
You still have
that drawing?

35:01.333 --> 35:02.792
Of course.

35:02.875 --> 35:04.709
I never threw it out.

35:04.792 --> 35:08.792
I'd forgotten, what she said
to me that night until now.

35:08.875 --> 35:12.041
That I was her
very
best little girl.

35:12.125 --> 35:16.166
You sure it was Nancy's poem
on the back of that paper?

35:16.250 --> 35:18.458
That's what my mother said.

35:18.542 --> 35:19.875
It was hers.

35:21.834 --> 35:25.875
"Hollow. No escape
from the dark.

35:26.709 --> 35:27.917
"I sit.

35:28.041 --> 35:29.709
Huh.

35:29.792 --> 35:32.375
Alone in empty rooms."

35:32.458 --> 35:34.709
Poetry ain't really my thing,
but I gotta admit

35:34.792 --> 35:36.750
that this one got to me.

35:36.834 --> 35:39.000
It was translated
into seven
languages.

35:39.083 --> 35:41.959
Critics said it was infused
with your wife's spirit.

35:42.041 --> 35:44.125
It was.
I dedicated it to
her.

35:44.208 --> 35:46.667
Didn't really see you as
the type to write like
this.

35:46.750 --> 35:47.875
What do you mean?

35:47.959 --> 35:51.792
Oh, this poem
is about...frailty.

35:51.875 --> 35:53.667
People on the fringes,
lost hope.

35:53.750 --> 35:56.792
Nancy knew a lot about
that, didn't she?

35:56.875 --> 35:59.375
Uneducated,
orphaned by her mother..

35:59.458 --> 36:02.125
...widowed, raising a kid
on her own.

36:02.208 --> 36:03.792
She didn't have
an easy time of
it.

36:03.875 --> 36:07.542
The worst part is she never
got the credit she deserved.

36:07.625 --> 36:09.417
I'm afraid I'm not following.

36:09.500 --> 36:12.083
This was infused
with your wife's spirit

36:12.166 --> 36:14.250
because she wrote
the damn thing.

36:15.458 --> 36:16.750
It's preposterous.

36:16.834 --> 36:18.166
Then what was
Nancy's original

36:18.250 --> 36:20.542
doing in the attic
in your desk?

36:23.625 --> 36:25.208
It's not Nancy's
original.
It's mine.

36:25.291 --> 36:28.208
You didn't use a typewriter.
Remember, the muse and all?

36:28.291 --> 36:30.834
- Sh-sh-sh-she typed it for
me.
- You son of a bitch.

36:30.917 --> 36:33.125
She's the one who should be
sitting behind that desk.

36:33.208 --> 36:35.041
- And you know it.
- Nonsense!

36:35.125 --> 36:37.083
You had a deadline,
your career was at stake.

36:37.166 --> 36:38.875
And you couldn't write
a thing, could you?

36:38.959 --> 36:40.917
Now, who better to steal
from than the real talent

36:41.000 --> 36:41.959
living in your house.

36:42.041 --> 36:43.500
She stole from me!

36:43.583 --> 36:45.917
That's what you told
yourself.
How you slept at night?

36:46.000 --> 36:47.583
You made her out to be nuts
so you could steal

36:47.667 --> 36:49.208
her work and make
it your own.

36:49.291 --> 36:52.125
You got poor, dumb, lovelorn
Annette in on the plan, too.

36:52.208 --> 36:54.208
It's a perfect solution.

36:54.291 --> 36:55.542
Nancy's daughter

36:55.625 --> 36:59.333
spent her entire life afraid
she might go crazy, too.

36:59.417 --> 37:01.542
Beating herself up,
thinking she was the one

37:01.625 --> 37:03.500
who pushed her mother
over the edge.

37:04.333 --> 37:05.875
But it was you.

37:06.959 --> 37:08.834
I was so desperate.

37:08.917 --> 37:11.792
People expected
so much from me.

37:11.875 --> 37:15.250
- I had no choice!
- Why your wife?

37:15.333 --> 37:16.583
'Why steal from her?'

37:16.667 --> 37:19.500
Had to be other writers
around, other students.

37:21.250 --> 37:23.500
You still don't
get it, do you?

37:23.583 --> 37:24.959
Get what?

37:25.959 --> 37:28.875
How good Nancy was.

37:35.166 --> 37:36.291
Nance?

37:38.667 --> 37:40.542
Nancy?

37:57.542 --> 37:59.000
Daniel.

37:59.083 --> 38:00.917
Nancy.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.583
- What are you doing up here?
- I'm confused.

38:03.667 --> 38:05.166
I know. You need rest.
Come to bed.

38:05.250 --> 38:07.333
I'm confused about who you are.

38:07.417 --> 38:08.500
What?

38:08.583 --> 38:10.917
Only a monster would
use this against me.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.208
You're the one
who's lost his
mind.

38:18.291 --> 38:19.709
You shouldn't
have come up here.

38:19.792 --> 38:23.041
You took my words.
You took me!

38:23.125 --> 38:24.583
You know what my first
professor said about
me?

38:24.667 --> 38:27.667
He said my pen must have
been touched by the Gods.

38:27.750 --> 38:29.542
He said my
potential
was unlimited.

38:29.625 --> 38:32.208
- What's wrong with you,
Daniel?
- He was wrong.

38:32.291 --> 38:34.125
All I had was
potential,
nothing more.

38:34.208 --> 38:37.083
I have craft and
diligence
and a PhD.

38:37.166 --> 38:40.208
And it's amounted to
a thousand pages of
mediocrity.

38:40.291 --> 38:41.875
I'm going downstairs
to Rachel.

38:41.959 --> 38:45.250
As I toiled in the dark,
where were the Gods then?

38:45.333 --> 38:46.709
Where were they?

38:46.792 --> 38:48.333
With a secretary?

38:50.709 --> 38:52.500
This is genius.

38:52.583 --> 38:55.000
Written by a
daughter
of the state?

38:55.083 --> 38:57.375
- That's what you hate--
- You couldn't have done this.

38:57.458 --> 38:59.458
You couldn't have
written this. Not
you!

38:59.542 --> 39:00.875
But I did.

39:00.959 --> 39:03.792
- I did write it, Daniel.
- No, you didn't. I did.

39:03.875 --> 39:07.375
It's mine.
You stole it from
me.

39:07.458 --> 39:10.291
My pen has been touched
by the hand of God.

39:11.333 --> 39:12.583
Oh.
