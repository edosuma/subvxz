WEBVTT

00:03.637 --> 00:05.037
(guns cocking)

00:07.407 --> 00:09.808
(sam): Shottipper registered,
multiple shots fired.

00:09.876 --> 00:11.510
Secure the perimeter.
(man, over radio):<i> Copy.</i>

00:12.479 --> 00:14.546
- We go in easy.
Follow my lead.

00:14.614 --> 00:15.947
Decent neighborhood,
good people.

00:16.016 --> 00:18.784
- Good people. Excellent people.
Do you know these people?

00:18.852 --> 00:20.419
- Marshall court's where
keegan and I

00:20.487 --> 00:22.220
Ran our community
program for five years,

00:22.289 --> 00:23.388
So yeah,
I know the place.

00:23.457 --> 00:25.257
- Absolutely. I apologize.
You take the lead.

00:25.259 --> 00:26.692
- Yeah, thank you.

00:27.627 --> 00:29.161
(loud blasts)

00:29.229 --> 00:31.063
(panting): Bob, what's
your position?

00:31.131 --> 00:32.064
(bob, over radio):
<i> Perimeter secured.</i>

00:32.132 --> 00:33.298
<i> Going in on three.</i>

00:33.366 --> 00:34.566
<i> Three...</i>
- They're going on three...

00:34.634 --> 00:36.668
On two. On one. Go!

00:36.736 --> 00:39.038
(blasts continue)

00:43.944 --> 00:45.477
(blasts and exclamations)

00:49.716 --> 00:51.483
(man): Alright, team,
stand down.

00:51.552 --> 00:54.219
(revellers laughing
and exclaiming)

01:01.228 --> 01:03.195
- That is definitely not a gun.

01:03.263 --> 01:06.098
(sighing): They're shooting
fireworks at one another?

01:06.933 --> 01:08.700
- Okay, guys, party's over!

01:08.768 --> 01:10.635
- Sorry, bob,
you guys can go home.

01:10.704 --> 01:12.471
Thanks to shottipper,
another false alarm.

01:12.539 --> 01:13.905
(sam): It's not really like
a false alarm,

01:13.974 --> 01:15.173
It's more just like,
a different alarm.

01:15.242 --> 01:17.442
- It's not a guns and gangs
alarm so psr will handle it.

01:17.511 --> 01:20.445
- Okay. Okay!
Okay.

01:20.514 --> 01:21.813
Hello there, my friends.

01:21.815 --> 01:24.783
Just so you know, you could've
really hurt your comrade there.

01:24.852 --> 01:26.485
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

01:26.553 --> 01:28.954
Hey! Crystal!
What's up?

01:29.022 --> 01:32.290
(sam): I know the teen hormone.
- Go, you guys! Go!

01:32.359 --> 01:34.259
(sam): But safety is not a what?
What is it not?

01:34.327 --> 01:35.427
Let me hear you say it.

01:35.495 --> 01:37.462
It is not a... Joke.

01:37.531 --> 01:40.466
That's right. We don't want to--
- sam! Look out, sam, look out!

01:41.434 --> 01:42.334
(bystanders): Whoa!

01:42.402 --> 01:43.702
(duff): Richie, get out of here!

01:43.770 --> 01:45.137
(richie): Whoa!
- Go home, richie. Now!

01:45.205 --> 01:46.938
- Did you just aim that
at me, young man?

01:47.007 --> 01:47.839
Is that what just happened?

01:47.908 --> 01:49.207
- We're just playing war.

01:49.276 --> 01:50.909
- Pyrotechnics,
it is not a toy.

01:50.977 --> 01:52.478
Safety is not a joke.
- Let me handle it.

01:52.546 --> 01:54.379
- Yo, chill. Chill.
(sam): Listen, I just would like

01:54.447 --> 01:55.580
To talk to you.
(richie): Relax!

01:55.649 --> 01:57.449
- That's it, I just- no,
listen. Get back here, please!

01:57.517 --> 01:59.851
- Sam, will you just let me
take... The lea--

01:59.920 --> 02:01.953
(indistinct chatter
over police radio)

02:02.022 --> 02:05.357
(sam): Hello! Please, do not be
afraid of me!

02:05.425 --> 02:09.361
I would just like to talk
to you. I am an ally!

02:13.667 --> 02:15.367
- Wha-- kelly?

02:15.435 --> 02:17.569
- Didn't I tell you
to go home?

02:17.637 --> 02:19.371
- Can I just go? Come on, man.

02:19.439 --> 02:22.374
(sam): Listen, young man,
I have raised a boy, okay?

02:22.442 --> 02:24.509
So I know exactly what is
going on here

02:24.578 --> 02:26.945
And if you would just
let me help--

02:27.013 --> 02:30.081
But I'm just gonna let kelly
take the lead here, so...

02:30.150 --> 02:31.783
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

02:31.852 --> 02:33.185
(dog barks in the distance)

02:33.253 --> 02:34.419
(kelly sighs): Richie,

02:34.487 --> 02:36.588
If I catch you shooting
those things again at people,

02:36.590 --> 02:39.391
I'm gonna grab you
and bring you in myself,

02:39.459 --> 02:41.460
Make you do more
community service.

02:41.528 --> 02:42.394
You hear me?

02:42.996 --> 02:45.030
- Yeah.
- Alright.

02:45.032 --> 02:46.498
Go on.
Get outta here.

02:48.768 --> 02:50.002
And go home!

02:52.939 --> 02:54.606
- How'd I do?
Like, any better?

02:54.675 --> 02:56.208
- Not bad, not bad.

02:56.276 --> 02:59.211
But don't feel the need to
announce the whole ally thing.

02:59.213 --> 03:00.345
- Yes, yes.
- You know?

03:00.347 --> 03:02.147
But progress is good.
- Okay.

03:02.215 --> 03:03.949
It's not bad.
- Good.

03:10.056 --> 03:14.226
♪ birds of a feather
flock together ♪

03:14.294 --> 03:16.695
♪ yes they do ♪

03:16.763 --> 03:18.029

03:26.940 --> 03:28.807
(woman): We see you, kelly.

03:29.943 --> 03:31.510
(duff chuckles)

03:33.247 --> 03:34.546
- I was just playing.
I'm kidding!

03:34.614 --> 03:37.048
Hey, baby sis!
- Hey!

03:37.117 --> 03:38.383
Look at you!

03:38.451 --> 03:41.386
Oh!
(adriana): Oh, good to see you!

03:41.455 --> 03:42.887
- I don't see you enough.

03:42.956 --> 03:45.123
(sighing): Karina...

03:45.191 --> 03:46.925
(laughter)

03:46.993 --> 03:49.361
- Ah! I'm surprised you even
bothered to show up.

03:49.429 --> 03:52.731
- Well, you said it was
important, so, I'm here.

03:52.799 --> 03:54.933
So, what's up?
Did someone die?

03:55.001 --> 03:57.869
- Ah.
- Don't ask me.

03:57.937 --> 03:59.404
- Oh, uh, we ordered
without you,

03:59.406 --> 04:00.305
Are you gonna have
something?

04:00.373 --> 04:02.073
- I don't know,
what's the fastest?

04:02.142 --> 04:03.475
What?

04:03.543 --> 04:05.277
I gotta go to work.

04:05.345 --> 04:06.411
Uh, excuse me,

04:06.480 --> 04:08.814
Can I just get the breakfast
sandwich, please?

04:08.882 --> 04:09.815
Thank you.

04:10.884 --> 04:12.551
Oh, be careful.

04:12.619 --> 04:14.919
If the wind changes,
your face'll stay that way.

04:14.988 --> 04:16.888
(chuckling)

04:16.957 --> 04:19.624
- God, mom used to scare me
with that all the time.

04:19.627 --> 04:21.493
Remember when she would
wet her finger a--

04:21.561 --> 04:23.128
- And put it up in the air!

04:23.196 --> 04:25.764
- Okay, so, are you gonna
tell me why you...

04:25.832 --> 04:27.299
Graced toronto with
your presence?

04:27.367 --> 04:28.800
- Okay.

04:31.538 --> 04:33.105
I'm just gonna say it.
Uh.

04:33.173 --> 04:34.039
(clears throat)

04:34.908 --> 04:37.108
I'm pregnant.
- Oh my god.

04:37.177 --> 04:38.376
Karina, are you serious?

04:38.445 --> 04:39.544
- Yeah.

04:39.612 --> 04:41.446
I've been doing ivf, and...

04:41.448 --> 04:43.882
After the third time,
it worked.

04:43.950 --> 04:45.350
I'm pregnant.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.385
(adriana): I can't believe it.

04:47.454 --> 04:50.522
This is so incredible.
Because guess what?

04:50.590 --> 04:51.456
I'm pregnant.

04:51.458 --> 04:52.857
- Get out.

04:52.926 --> 04:54.359
- I wasn't gonna tell you guys

04:54.427 --> 04:55.460
Because larissa
wanted us to wait

04:55.528 --> 04:57.329
Till I was in
the second trimester,

04:57.397 --> 05:00.265
But... Oh my god we're gonna be
raising babies together!

05:00.334 --> 05:02.034
(happy exclamations)

05:04.338 --> 05:08.606
- Wow. Ha. This, it's... Wow.
That's a lot. That's...

05:08.609 --> 05:10.942
That's a lot of babies
at one time.

05:11.011 --> 05:12.744
(adriana): Yeah!

05:12.812 --> 05:14.346
I think you owe me
100 bucks, kelly.

05:14.414 --> 05:16.281
You always said you'd be
the first one to be pregnant.

05:16.350 --> 05:17.349
- Yeah, well,

05:17.417 --> 05:19.651
Just too bad she picks
such dickhead boyfriends.

05:19.719 --> 05:21.619
- Ah... What are you
talking about?

05:21.622 --> 05:24.256
- Um, len grierson?

05:24.324 --> 05:25.924
- Oh my god, he was horrible.

05:25.992 --> 05:29.227
- Okay. Okay, they were not
all that bad.

05:29.296 --> 05:31.430
There was that one good one.

05:31.498 --> 05:32.764
Nathan...

05:32.832 --> 05:34.132
- Hm. And where he at?

05:34.200 --> 05:36.868
Nathan!
(adriana snickers)

05:39.173 --> 05:40.706
- It didn't work out.

05:40.774 --> 05:45.310
And yes, I know, I'm...
Bad at relationships.

05:45.312 --> 05:46.544
Anyway,

05:46.613 --> 05:48.513
Now I don't need to have babies

05:48.515 --> 05:52.084
Because aunt kelly can just
borrow the two of yours, right?

05:53.353 --> 05:54.219
Congratulations.

05:54.287 --> 05:56.921
Ah, yes, please, let's eat,
shall we?

05:56.924 --> 05:58.123
Thank you.

05:58.191 --> 06:01.025
- I will be honest,
I'm hoping I have twins.

06:01.094 --> 06:04.129
(karina): Nuh-uh, not me. No.
But I do want a little girl.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.196
- Oh, yes!

06:05.265 --> 06:06.998
(adriana and karina conversing
indistinctly)

06:11.704 --> 06:13.238
(indistinct chatter
over police radio)

06:14.441 --> 06:15.507
(horn sounding)

06:16.744 --> 06:19.577
- Oh, well, jeez!
- Yeah.

06:19.646 --> 06:21.746
- It was-it was your turn.
- I thought so.

06:21.815 --> 06:23.748
I got us a dark roast
from somalia.

06:23.817 --> 06:24.683
- Oh, that's nice.
- Yeah.

06:24.751 --> 06:26.151
That's a goo-
medium from the andes.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.252
- Okay.

06:27.254 --> 06:28.720
(both stuttering)

06:28.788 --> 06:29.988
(both laughing)
do we...

06:30.056 --> 06:31.723
- Do you want me to...

06:31.791 --> 06:32.924
Just... Let's...
- Should we sit?

06:32.992 --> 06:34.059
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:34.762 --> 06:36.128
(naz grunts)

06:36.996 --> 06:38.830
I'm gonna take this one and--
- yeah.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.365
- Yeah, right? Yeah.

06:43.370 --> 06:44.702
Oh, that's good.
- This is nice too.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.104
- It's really good.
- It's, like, chocolatey.

06:46.173 --> 06:47.639
There's chocolate in here.
- Yeah, kinda nutty, right?

06:47.707 --> 06:50.175
- Yeah, like, n-- like,
nutty smokey.

06:50.243 --> 06:51.643
- Smokey, that's the word

06:51.711 --> 06:52.744
I was thinking about.
- Was it?

06:52.812 --> 06:53.745
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:54.848 --> 06:55.947
(siren in the distance)

06:59.720 --> 07:03.721
Maybe it would give, like,
the nice type of coffee breath.

07:03.724 --> 07:05.190
- Yeah, maybe.
- Maybe.

07:05.192 --> 07:07.125
Yeah.
- Could I smell you-- it?

07:07.194 --> 07:08.860
The-- your breath?

07:08.862 --> 07:10.662
- You want to smell
my coffee breath?

07:10.664 --> 07:11.830
- Okay.

07:11.898 --> 07:13.031
- Okay.
- Okay.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.335
Oh, that's not bad.

07:17.403 --> 07:18.503
- Is it?
- It's really good.

07:18.571 --> 07:19.805
- Reall-- how--
- smell mine, smell mine.

07:19.873 --> 07:20.739
(exhaling)

07:20.807 --> 07:22.040
- Very nice.
- Is it?

07:23.843 --> 07:25.977
- Hey! What's up, my peoples?

07:26.045 --> 07:27.612
Oh, is that for me?
- Well, su--

07:27.614 --> 07:28.880
- Thank you!
- Sure.

07:30.083 --> 07:31.382
- Oh, that's bitter as hell.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.884
Tastes like asparagus piss.
(sam): That's nice.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.820
- Come on, we got this meeting
in five minutes.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.021
- Okay.
- Alright.

07:36.089 --> 07:38.623
- Um... Okay, well...

07:38.625 --> 07:40.325
Great. I mean,
I'll see you later.

07:40.393 --> 07:43.761
- Yeah. Actually,
I gotta go this way too,

07:43.830 --> 07:44.963
It's the best way into
the building.

07:45.031 --> 07:46.698
- Oh, yeah. Of course!

07:46.700 --> 07:47.832
- Funny.

07:47.901 --> 07:48.967
- We'll...
- Yeah.

07:49.035 --> 07:50.335
- ...Say goodbye again,
but like, inside.

07:50.403 --> 07:51.436
- We could do it inside too.

07:51.505 --> 07:52.304
- Indoors.
- Yeah.

07:52.372 --> 07:53.705
- Okay.
- There's no rule on

07:53.773 --> 07:55.039
How many times you get to
say goodbye.

07:55.042 --> 07:56.107
- I guess not.
- Right?

07:56.176 --> 07:57.642
- Okay, here we go.
- Thank you.

07:57.644 --> 08:00.011
- How was breakfast?
- Great.

08:00.079 --> 08:02.881
Egg sandwich with a side of
the same old criticism.

08:02.949 --> 08:04.516
- My god, I get you.

08:04.584 --> 08:06.051
Being around family
makes me feel perpetually 12.

08:06.119 --> 08:07.853
I am so glad that my mother
lives in florida.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.320
- Yeah, with your son.

08:09.323 --> 08:11.256
I can't believe you live in that
big house by yourself,

08:11.324 --> 08:13.124
Yet you and naz are still
having dates on a bench

08:13.192 --> 08:14.192
Outside of work.

08:14.260 --> 08:15.560
Have you even kissed
the boy yet?

08:15.628 --> 08:18.129
- We were going to and then,
you rudely beaver-dammed me.

08:18.197 --> 08:19.564
Is that what you call it,
is it beaver-damming?

08:19.632 --> 08:21.032
- You were on a bench
outside of work,

08:21.100 --> 08:23.067
Everyone and their dog
could've beaver-dammed you.

08:23.136 --> 08:24.769
- Ooh! If it was a dog
it'd be hump-halting,

08:24.837 --> 08:25.871
Or a cooch-pooching.

08:25.939 --> 08:27.171
- You do realize
in this scenario,

08:27.240 --> 08:28.607
You are the dog,
right?

08:28.675 --> 08:31.843
The point I'm trying to make is
you need to get that man alone.

08:31.911 --> 08:33.812
- Listen, he is fresh out of
a marriage.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.380
(duff pants)
I am letting him set the pace.

08:35.448 --> 08:37.883
Good morning, ds michaels.
- Morning, sam.

08:37.951 --> 08:41.052
Good morning, kelly.
- Morning, michaels.

08:41.120 --> 08:44.689
- On page number 13... Yes, 13,

08:44.691 --> 08:48.092
Item number 16a, the statistics
speak for themselves.

08:48.161 --> 08:50.128
The gunfire detection software

08:50.196 --> 08:52.697
Shottipper is saving
time and money.

08:52.765 --> 08:54.933
- Yeah, but shottipper registers
<i> every</i> loud noise

08:55.001 --> 08:57.969
As gunfire, sir.
Last night, it was fireworks.

08:57.971 --> 08:59.837
- Yeah, and the other day,
it was a car backfiring.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.706
- Why target marshall court?

09:01.774 --> 09:03.441
- I think they're lucky
to have shottipper.

09:03.509 --> 09:04.776
It's a high-crime area.

09:04.844 --> 09:06.111
- It's a decent neighbourhood.

09:06.847 --> 09:09.047
They don't deserve to have
a full swat team show up

09:09.115 --> 09:11.115
Every time a kid decides
to set off a firecracker.

09:11.184 --> 09:12.116
(watts): At people.

09:12.185 --> 09:14.319
They were setting them off...
At people.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.187
- Didn't you almost
have a hole

09:16.255 --> 09:18.022
Burned into the back of your
head, wazowski?

09:18.091 --> 09:19.757
- I wouldn't say, like, a hole--
- well, technically,

09:19.826 --> 09:24.062
It was almost... The shottipper
that got her killed.

09:24.130 --> 09:25.129
(hesitating): Right.

09:25.198 --> 09:27.966
Well... You've probably
noticed, sir, that

09:28.034 --> 09:29.968
Detective duff and I have a bit
of a mind-meld happening here.

09:30.036 --> 09:31.670
We're kind of like, I don't
know how to say it,

09:31.738 --> 09:32.837
Two peas in a pod.

09:32.905 --> 09:34.772
- It's more like yin and yang
than peas in a pod.

09:34.841 --> 09:36.374
- Yeah, but we're aligned, we
finish each other's sentences.

09:36.442 --> 09:37.508
No, we don't finish each
other's thoughts...

09:37.577 --> 09:38.476
- Sentences.

09:38.545 --> 09:40.011
Oh my god, she just
did that on purpose.

09:40.013 --> 09:42.113
You did that on purpose.
- I did not do it on purpose.

09:42.181 --> 09:43.014
(overlapping chatter)

09:43.082 --> 09:44.749
- Stop!
(duff): I know what I was--

09:45.218 --> 09:46.517
- Can we focus, please?

09:46.586 --> 09:48.286
- Y-yes, sir.

09:48.288 --> 09:49.787
Yes, and my point is,

09:49.856 --> 09:52.924
That marshall court is
a marginalized neighborhood,

09:52.992 --> 09:54.459
They don't trust us,
now we're spying on them.

09:54.527 --> 09:55.694
- Oh my gosh, you took the words

09:55.762 --> 09:57.395
Right out of my mouth.
That's what I was thinking.

09:57.463 --> 09:58.830
(michaels): I hear you. Okay?

09:58.898 --> 10:01.166
I'm a numbers person.
Math is my strong suit.

10:01.234 --> 10:02.433
In the last five years,

10:02.502 --> 10:04.836
65% of the shootings,
basically two thirds,

10:04.838 --> 10:07.105
Took place in
68 and 44 divisions.

10:07.173 --> 10:08.506
If this is where the guns are,

10:08.575 --> 10:10.508
This is where shottipper's
going to take us.

10:10.576 --> 10:11.676
Does that make sense?

10:11.744 --> 10:13.645
I'm going to see to it that

10:13.713 --> 10:14.846
Our incident numbers are down

10:14.914 --> 10:16.014
And our budget numbers are up.

10:16.082 --> 10:18.650
Because that's what I'm hired
to do. Okay?

10:18.718 --> 10:20.185
Okay.

10:21.421 --> 10:22.787
Moving on to item number 16b.

10:22.855 --> 10:24.422
- Okay, uh, yes,

10:24.424 --> 10:26.524
We are making progress with
the pandilla quince gang

10:26.593 --> 10:28.326
Out of mexico that are making
inroads up here.

10:28.328 --> 10:30.461
- I want you to bring
drug squad in on this.

10:30.530 --> 10:32.931
- Ow.
- Oh, wow! Uh, we'd love to

10:32.999 --> 10:35.066
But...
(both): Can't.

10:35.134 --> 10:36.701
Until the investigation into

10:36.769 --> 10:39.337
Mcconnell and davidson is
wrapped up,

10:39.405 --> 10:40.938
We've been asked to
stay away.

10:41.007 --> 10:42.306
- Actually, mcconnell

10:42.375 --> 10:44.376
And davidson are packing up
their desks as we speak.

10:50.683 --> 10:52.850
(duff): There they go.
Twip and twerp.

10:52.919 --> 10:55.053
- Two peas in a pod.
- Uh-huh.

10:55.121 --> 10:57.789
- Don't get too choked up, duff.
- Oh, that's...

10:57.857 --> 10:59.424
- See you soon, ladies.

11:01.361 --> 11:02.894
- So, you got them axed?

11:02.962 --> 11:04.195
- The union argued that

11:04.263 --> 11:06.197
We didn't have enough evidence
to let them go...

11:06.265 --> 11:08.032
(duff scoffs)
...But felt that everyone would

11:08.101 --> 11:10.368
Be better served if
we moved them to b&e.

11:10.437 --> 11:12.203
- What?! We're shuffling
the problem

11:12.271 --> 11:14.105
Underneath someone else's rug?
- Pretty much.

11:14.173 --> 11:15.406
But it's the best I could do.

11:15.475 --> 11:18.376
- So, how do we know ds michaels
wasn't shuffled under our rug?

11:18.444 --> 11:19.610
- Well, actually,

11:19.679 --> 11:21.312
I-I've been tracking his career
since I joined the force,

11:21.380 --> 11:23.347
He originated
the five-point plan,

11:23.416 --> 11:25.450
He just, he really does,
he has a stellar reputation.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.685
Oh, oh, wait, if mcconnell
and davidson are gone,

11:27.754 --> 11:31.456
Does this mean I can bring, uh,
naz into the airport sting?

11:31.524 --> 11:32.390
- Be my guest.

11:32.458 --> 11:34.125
- Okay.
- No, I am not about to hang out

11:34.194 --> 11:36.060
With you
and your boyfriend all day!

11:36.129 --> 11:38.563
- Well, I would never ask you
to... We're not...

11:38.631 --> 11:40.598
That's not what's happening.

11:40.666 --> 11:42.867
- It is exactly
what's happening!

11:42.936 --> 11:44.869
Twice this month,
federal border security found

11:44.871 --> 11:47.305
Two keys of pink cocaine taped
to the inside of the garbage can

11:47.373 --> 11:48.372
In the passenger bathroom

11:48.441 --> 11:50.141
On the same glide air flight
from mexico.

11:50.209 --> 11:51.409
Fbs left those drugs in place,

11:51.411 --> 11:53.044
Hoping to see who was taking
them off the plane,

11:53.112 --> 11:53.945
But... No luck.

11:54.013 --> 11:55.413
- Yeah, it's not a passenger

11:55.481 --> 11:57.315
Because fbs doesn't board
for inspection

11:57.383 --> 11:58.583
Until after they've left.

11:58.651 --> 12:00.251
Which means...
- Flight crew.

12:00.319 --> 12:01.786
Both flights in question had

12:01.854 --> 12:03.121
Two of the same
flight attendants.

12:03.189 --> 12:05.389
Lorraine lennon, 29... Single,

12:05.458 --> 12:07.158
Has been with glide air
for about a year.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.026
And brice roberts, 35,
also single,

12:09.095 --> 12:10.061
Just recovering from
a bankruptcy.

12:10.129 --> 12:11.629
- Have we tapped their phones?

12:11.697 --> 12:13.798
(sam): No, um, but that's...

12:13.866 --> 12:15.833
That's where you guys
are gonna come in.

12:15.902 --> 12:16.835
We have the warrant,

12:16.903 --> 12:18.302
But the phone company
is gonna take ages

12:18.305 --> 12:19.504
To get us their phone numbers.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.372
- Yeah, and-and who knows
how much they're gonna smuggle

12:21.440 --> 12:22.273
While we wait.

12:22.341 --> 12:24.375
But, if we go in
as flight attendants,

12:24.443 --> 12:26.611
Make nice, get a hold of
their phones,

12:26.679 --> 12:29.247
And use them to call into
the intelligence line, then...

12:29.315 --> 12:30.348
- Then we have their numbers

12:30.416 --> 12:31.649
And we can tack them
onto the warrant.

12:31.717 --> 12:32.550
- Yeah.
- Yeah,

12:32.618 --> 12:33.818
And we can stay up on
those phones

12:33.886 --> 12:34.853
As long as they
use them.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.120
I like it.
When do we start?

12:36.123 --> 12:37.722
- Well, uh, we've got
the clearance badges.

12:37.724 --> 12:38.623
Uniforms are on their way.

12:38.691 --> 12:40.591
- Oh, but no, we'll handle it.

12:40.660 --> 12:42.426
I- you know, I'm sure
you're busy

12:42.495 --> 12:43.694
With a whole...
Lot of...

12:43.763 --> 12:45.563
Ds work to do.
- Oh, no, no, no.

12:45.631 --> 12:46.798
That's not how I run things.

12:46.866 --> 12:49.133
Shanks pulled me over here
to see how this team works,

12:49.202 --> 12:50.368
So I go out with the team.

12:50.436 --> 12:52.003
You can't ignore me forever,
duff.

12:52.071 --> 12:53.204
So, flight attendants, huh?

12:53.272 --> 12:55.473
I like it.
Love the uniforms.

12:55.475 --> 12:57.475
Cute little blazers,
little hats...

12:57.544 --> 13:00.711
- Right? So professional,
so stylish.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.947
- So uncomfortable.

13:02.949 --> 13:05.116
How the hell we supposed to walk
in these things?

13:05.184 --> 13:06.618
- I don't know. Who invented
the pencil skirt

13:06.686 --> 13:09.020
And are they still alive because
I need to have words with them.

13:09.088 --> 13:11.689
Uh. So oppressive. So... Toxic!

13:11.758 --> 13:14.392
I mean, do the male flight
attendants have to wear these?

13:14.460 --> 13:17.929
No, they don't. They get to
wear pants with a loose crotch.

13:20.766 --> 13:23.201
- No, it looks good.
You did a f-- you d--

13:23.269 --> 13:24.469
Well...

13:26.138 --> 13:27.972
- Wow. You two look great.

13:27.974 --> 13:29.707
- Thank you.
- See, look at us.

13:29.776 --> 13:30.875
Two peas in a pod.

13:30.943 --> 13:31.942
(sighing): Say that again

13:31.944 --> 13:33.244
And I'll make you
a black-eyed pea, wazowski.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.879
- Ooh, like fergie?
Like her? Can I be her?

13:34.947 --> 13:36.514
Can I be that one?
I love her.

13:36.516 --> 13:38.049
She's amazing.
- Of course you do.

13:38.051 --> 13:39.517
- She can really move.
And you know what?

13:39.586 --> 13:40.585
I actually am
an incredible dancer.

13:40.653 --> 13:41.452
(duff snickers)

13:47.860 --> 13:49.794
(woman over pa):<i> Passengers</i>
<i> on flight 721...</i>

13:49.796 --> 13:51.262
- Hey.
<i> - ...Your gate has changed</i>

13:51.331 --> 13:54.599
<i> To gate 5. Passengers</i>
<i> on flight 721,</i>

13:54.667 --> 13:56.868
<i> Your gate has changed</i>
<i> to gate 5.</i>

13:57.803 --> 14:00.004
- Ah. Comms are in there.
- Great.

14:00.072 --> 14:01.906
- Duff and wazowski are
in position.

14:01.974 --> 14:03.408
(naz sighs)

14:04.543 --> 14:05.643
So...

14:06.613 --> 14:07.578
You and duff, huh?

14:07.647 --> 14:08.846
- What about me and duff?

14:08.915 --> 14:10.815
- Uh, just that, uh...

14:10.884 --> 14:12.750
It's been a minute since
you guys worked together.

14:12.818 --> 14:13.918
- I'm a professional.

14:13.986 --> 14:15.820
I can compartmentalize.

14:15.822 --> 14:18.456
Probably harder for you,
working with wazowski.

14:18.524 --> 14:19.924
- I have no issue
working with sam.

14:19.992 --> 14:24.295
- Okay, but you do
get kinda quiet.

14:24.297 --> 14:25.796
Your voice goes all soft.

14:25.865 --> 14:26.898
(high-pitched):
See, that's not...

14:26.966 --> 14:28.866
(clears throat): ...That's
not... That's not true.

14:28.935 --> 14:30.701
- It's nice.
- Nice.

14:30.770 --> 14:32.770
(scoffing):
I don't want to be nice.

14:32.772 --> 14:34.538
I'm always described as nice.

14:34.607 --> 14:37.141
Or sweet. Cute.

14:37.209 --> 14:38.910
Charming. A joy to be around.

14:38.912 --> 14:42.413
But what about, you know,
strong, firm, manly?

14:42.481 --> 14:44.448
- Nah, that's old-school.

14:44.517 --> 14:46.718
Modern-day women want
modern-day men.

14:46.786 --> 14:47.985
Like us.

14:48.054 --> 14:49.186
- Yeah, well,

14:49.189 --> 14:50.321
I don't think sam and I have

14:50.389 --> 14:52.056
A modern-day anything
at this point.

14:52.125 --> 14:53.324
I don't want to rush her,
you know?

14:53.393 --> 14:54.558
- Yeah, I feel you.

14:54.627 --> 14:56.093
If I had my time back,

14:56.162 --> 14:58.296
I probably would've taken things
slower with kelly.

14:58.364 --> 15:00.564
- Mm.
- Gabrielle is great,

15:00.633 --> 15:02.066
But I still think about...

15:02.134 --> 15:03.234
(duff, over radio):<i> Hey, guys,</i>

15:03.302 --> 15:06.203
<i> You know this is a two-way</i>
<i> this time. Right?</i>

15:06.206 --> 15:09.740
- Oh, wow! Yeah, no, we were,
uh... (laughing uncomfortably)

15:09.809 --> 15:11.842
We were just making sure that
you were listening.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.444
- Oh, we were listening.

15:13.512 --> 15:15.846
Very nice.
- And manly.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.315
Very, very manly.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.185
(woman): Anthony,

15:21.254 --> 15:23.487
Admit it, you take this flight
to spend more time with me.

15:23.556 --> 15:25.957
- True. Can't wait to
take you to my place in cancun.

15:26.025 --> 15:28.626
Keep talking. I'll walk you
to baggage claim.

15:28.695 --> 15:30.094
- I don't have baggage.

15:30.163 --> 15:32.797
- Handsome man, no baggage?
Marry me.

15:32.865 --> 15:34.165
(anthony): Oh, I plan on it.

15:34.233 --> 15:36.600
- At least lorraine
can walk in this skirt.

15:36.669 --> 15:37.702
- Excuse me.

15:39.138 --> 15:39.971
Excuse me.

15:41.307 --> 15:44.508
Mm. Brice is a little jumpy.

15:44.577 --> 15:46.243
Alright, let's go.
(woman over pa):<i> Flight 217</i>

15:46.246 --> 15:49.247
<i> To winnipeg is boarding now</i>
<i> at gate 40.</i>

15:49.315 --> 15:53.051
<i> Flight 217 to winnipeg is</i>
<i> boarding now at gate 40.</i>

15:53.119 --> 15:54.218
(duff winces)
(lorraine): Anthony is

15:54.286 --> 15:58.856
So romantic, and incredibly
smart and ambitious...

15:58.924 --> 16:01.525
- Oh yeah?
Why's he flying steerage?

16:01.528 --> 16:04.595
- Ugh! I love that he doesn't
fly business class,

16:04.663 --> 16:06.397
That's, like, so
not pretentious.

16:06.466 --> 16:09.200
- Wouldn't want to date someone
up to your mother's standards.

16:09.268 --> 16:12.136
- Please, I'm not up to
my mother's standards.

16:12.205 --> 16:15.339
- Hm.
(sighing): No one is.

16:15.408 --> 16:17.975
(pa beeping)
(woman):<i> Flight 821 for orlando</i>

16:18.044 --> 16:19.677
<i> Is now boarding at gate 7.</i>

16:19.746 --> 16:23.681
<i> Flight 821 for orlando is</i>
<i> boarding at gate 7.</i>

16:23.749 --> 16:25.516
(lorraine sighs contentedly)

16:25.584 --> 16:29.587
(woman over pa):
<i> Now boarding flight 272.</i>

16:29.655 --> 16:33.224
<i> Now boarding flight 272.</i>

16:34.760 --> 16:36.361
- Ugh. Tsk.

16:38.597 --> 16:41.899
- Just relationships, you know?
Ugh. So hard.

16:41.967 --> 16:44.035
Pff. I know the feeling.

16:44.103 --> 16:47.338
It's taken me, like, 10 years
to meet a decent guy.

16:47.406 --> 16:48.573
- Me too!

16:48.641 --> 16:51.275
And this guy I'm seeing?
He is so sweet.

16:51.343 --> 16:53.844
<i> He's really cute.</i>
<i> He's really nice.</i>

16:53.913 --> 16:55.112
(lorraine):<i> So, what's</i>
<i> the problem?</i>

16:55.181 --> 16:56.080
<i> He sounds like a dream.</i>

16:56.148 --> 16:57.582
- I want him to make a move,

16:57.650 --> 16:59.750
But... He can't seem to take
the next step.

16:59.819 --> 17:02.953
(lorraine):
<i> Uh-huh. Listen to me,</i>

17:03.022 --> 17:05.256
You have to make
the move.

17:05.324 --> 17:07.992
Look, I am dating
the most amazing guy.

17:07.994 --> 17:10.728
I met him, I liked him,
I went for it,

17:10.730 --> 17:12.797
And now, I'm going to
meet him in cancun.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.365
- You pursued him?

17:14.433 --> 17:15.466
Oh my god!

17:15.468 --> 17:17.101
You're so courageous.
- Well,

17:17.169 --> 17:20.071
My mom always taught me
to be a feminist.

17:20.139 --> 17:22.807
Although, between you and me,
I'm kind of a bad feminist,

17:22.875 --> 17:24.575
'cause I'm saving up
for a boob job.

17:24.643 --> 17:26.610
- Feminists can get boob jobs.

17:26.679 --> 17:28.079
- Right?
- Right.

17:28.147 --> 17:32.349
- Thank you! Especially 'cause
I'm, like, doing it for myself.

17:32.418 --> 17:34.118
'cause anthony likes me
the way I am.

17:34.186 --> 17:35.286
- Uh-huh.

17:35.354 --> 17:37.154
- Go, go, go--
(horn blaring)

17:37.223 --> 17:39.590
Ugh!
- Mm.

17:39.658 --> 17:42.560
- Man, bench him, would you?
- Okay? Tell me about it.

17:42.628 --> 17:43.494
- Useless.
(phone chiming)

17:43.496 --> 17:44.429
- Useless.

17:52.271 --> 17:54.872
- Oh, no, thanks.
- Are you seeing this?

17:54.940 --> 17:56.340
No, thanks.

17:57.042 --> 17:59.243
Alright, here we go.

17:59.311 --> 18:01.245
- It is so fun to talk to you.

18:01.314 --> 18:03.681
- Lemme give you my number
so that we can stay in touch.

18:03.749 --> 18:05.449
- I would love that.
- Yes!

18:05.452 --> 18:06.751
- Here.
- Okay.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.587
Oh, you know what?
You have to put in your...

18:09.655 --> 18:11.555
Pass-
- oh, it's just, uh,

18:11.624 --> 18:13.023
It's true love...
- Okay.

18:13.092 --> 18:13.925
- ...Is the password.

18:13.993 --> 18:15.826
It's like, 8783...
- Yeah.

18:15.829 --> 18:16.861
- Just, true love.

18:17.763 --> 18:18.996
- You're gonna give it to
a stranger?

18:19.064 --> 18:20.731
- Ugh. Everyone knows
my password.

18:20.733 --> 18:22.433
I've had it since I was, like,
a teenager.

18:22.501 --> 18:23.801
(chuckling)

18:23.869 --> 18:24.935
- True love.

18:25.004 --> 18:27.505
Oh, you're, like,
a real romantic.

18:27.573 --> 18:29.474
- Well, true love is the answer
to everything.

18:31.043 --> 18:33.277
(telephone ringing)

18:33.345 --> 18:34.745
(soft beeping)

18:34.813 --> 18:36.647
(chiming)

18:36.715 --> 18:37.682
(nathan):<i> We've got it.</i>

18:37.750 --> 18:39.383
- I'm sam, by the way.

18:39.451 --> 18:41.685
- So, I'm on a flight
in a couple of hours

18:41.754 --> 18:43.654
And then, I'm back in
the morning. What about you?

18:43.722 --> 18:45.589
- I have a flight
in an hour to miami.

18:45.658 --> 18:47.658
(gasping): Super jelly.

18:47.726 --> 18:48.626
(lorraine chuckles)

18:48.694 --> 18:49.960
(brice): Hit it!

18:49.963 --> 18:51.829
Oh my god, guys!
(duff grunts)

18:53.432 --> 18:54.899
You're not the only one
on the court!

18:54.967 --> 18:56.701
- Crazy.
- I know.

18:59.638 --> 19:01.539
(telephone ringing)

19:01.607 --> 19:02.640
(soft beeping)

19:02.708 --> 19:04.041
(chiming)

19:04.109 --> 19:04.975
- We're in.

19:05.044 --> 19:08.045
- Excuse me.
Can you hand me a napkin?

19:08.113 --> 19:09.113
- Uh, yeah.

19:11.517 --> 19:14.118
- Thank you... So much.
- There you go.

19:17.723 --> 19:19.657
- We gotta make a play
instead of chucking threes.

19:19.725 --> 19:21.092
- Tell them that.

19:22.595 --> 19:23.928
You have a good one.

19:26.799 --> 19:28.299
I've got to run.

19:29.134 --> 19:31.535
- Okay. Well, good luck with
your guy.

19:31.604 --> 19:36.273
- Thanks.
- Oh, and remember, be brave.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.376
- I will.
- Okay.

19:39.612 --> 19:41.412
- Bye!
- Bye!

19:45.484 --> 19:48.018
(naz): Wow, yeah. Right.
- Hey.

19:48.087 --> 19:49.920
Shottipper picked up gunfire
in marshall court.

19:49.989 --> 19:52.623
(sighing): Again?
- Yeah. Team's heading out.

19:52.691 --> 19:53.857
- Okay, I-I can go.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.826
- No, no. I'll do it.

19:55.894 --> 19:58.462
Besides, I have a friend
over there I want to see anyway.

19:58.530 --> 19:59.363
Hey.

19:59.431 --> 20:01.966
(makes smacking noises)

20:02.034 --> 20:03.434
Get down.

20:03.502 --> 20:05.436
(duff chuckling)

20:05.438 --> 20:07.972
(clearing throat): Are, uh,
you... Doing anything tonight?

20:08.040 --> 20:10.741
- No. Are you?
- No.

20:10.809 --> 20:12.310
(phone ringing on line)

20:14.180 --> 20:15.680
(lorraine):<i> Hey, mom!</i>

20:15.682 --> 20:18.249
(mother):<i> Lorraine, you haven't</i>
<i> returned my calls in three day.</i>

20:18.317 --> 20:19.783
(lorraine):
<i> Sorry, I've been busy.</i>

20:19.786 --> 20:20.784
<i> I met a guy.</i>

20:20.853 --> 20:22.386
(mother):
<i> Great. Does he have a job?</i>

20:22.455 --> 20:24.288
(lorraine):
<i> Yes, he has a good job.</i>

20:24.356 --> 20:27.091
<i> He works for a software company</i>
<i> and he travels.</i>

20:27.159 --> 20:29.460
(mother): <i> Travellers are</i>
<i> cheaters. Trust me.</i>

20:29.528 --> 20:30.894
(phone ringing on line)

20:30.963 --> 20:31.962
- Oh, hang on.

20:32.031 --> 20:33.264
Brice is getting a call.

20:33.332 --> 20:35.065
(woman):
<i> Brice, do we have a plan?</i>

20:35.134 --> 20:37.468
(brice):<i> I land at 10 tomorrow.</i>
<i> I'll come straight to you.</i>

20:37.536 --> 20:39.203
<i> Make sure</i>
<i> nobody's following you.</i>

20:39.271 --> 20:40.771
(woman):<i> See you then.</i>

20:40.839 --> 20:42.106
- Okay, that's gotta be
our guy.

20:42.174 --> 20:44.141
He lands at 10 and we can
be there to get him.

20:44.209 --> 20:45.309
- Yeah.

20:45.311 --> 20:50.147
Oh, it's been a... Long day.
You're probably tired.

20:50.215 --> 20:53.017
- No, actually.
Uh, I'm not, are you?

20:53.085 --> 20:55.352
- No, I'm not tired at all.

20:55.421 --> 20:57.788
- That's great because I need
someone to sit down with me,

20:57.856 --> 21:00.024
Take notes, while I design a bit
of a five-pointer

21:00.092 --> 21:01.659
On the malvern heights guys.

21:01.727 --> 21:03.794
- Oh. Yeah, sure, uh...

21:03.862 --> 21:04.695
Oh, like, right now.

21:04.763 --> 21:06.196
- Right now.
(sam): Oh, okay! Yeah.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.765
Sure. No problem. Bye.

21:07.833 --> 21:09.800
- Yeah, I'll uh...
See you tomorrow.

21:09.868 --> 21:11.502
- See ya.

21:13.772 --> 21:15.940
(blasts and laughter)

21:17.409 --> 21:20.644
(duff): Alright, alright, kids,
come on, let's clear out.

21:20.713 --> 21:23.714
I said, let's go home!

21:23.782 --> 21:25.683
(teen): Aw!
(duff scoffs)

21:25.751 --> 21:27.818
Alright, send your boys home.

21:27.886 --> 21:30.221
This shottipper
is pissing me off.

21:31.024 --> 21:32.923
Sorry about that, guys.

21:32.925 --> 21:34.492
Thank you!

21:35.861 --> 21:37.261
(sighing)

21:37.263 --> 21:38.596
(police siren in the distance)

21:41.900 --> 21:43.634
(knocking)

21:47.406 --> 21:48.405
Keegan?

21:48.474 --> 21:49.840
- What do you want, kell?

21:49.908 --> 21:52.209
- I came to talk to crystal.

21:52.277 --> 21:53.477
What are you doing here?

21:53.545 --> 21:56.213
- I'm here visiting a friend,
what are you doing here?

21:56.281 --> 21:57.214
- Hey.

21:57.282 --> 21:59.183
- I ain't got nothing
to say to you.

21:59.251 --> 22:01.685
You're not loyal to him,
you're not loyal to us.

22:01.754 --> 22:02.753
Who are you loyal to, kelly?

22:02.821 --> 22:04.688
- So, you're gonna believe
what he has to say

22:04.757 --> 22:05.823
Without hearing
my side of things?

22:05.891 --> 22:08.159
- You could've come around
to explain your side,

22:08.227 --> 22:10.427
But nuh-uh, nah.

22:10.496 --> 22:12.630
You waited till you had to come
with the rest of your squad.

22:12.698 --> 22:13.864
Guns out.

22:13.932 --> 22:17.735
This shottipper thing is
ridiculous, and you know it.

22:17.803 --> 22:18.869
- She's right.

22:19.805 --> 22:21.238
You guys are asking
for trouble.

22:21.306 --> 22:24.508
(sighing): Right. And cops
are the bad guys, huh?

22:24.577 --> 22:26.777
Yet you're hanging out
with jeff keegan?

22:26.845 --> 22:28.145
(keegan): What?
Did you forget, kell?

22:29.315 --> 22:30.948
I'm not a cop.

22:35.320 --> 22:36.354
(exhales abruptly)

22:48.700 --> 22:51.402
't even like
keegan,

22:51.404 --> 22:53.404
I mean, I had to convince her
to work with him.

22:53.472 --> 22:54.471
And now, they're sleeping
together?

22:54.540 --> 22:56.940
- I don't know,
maybe she's lonely.

22:57.009 --> 22:58.776
- Nah, crystal fights
for the underdog.

22:58.844 --> 23:00.778
He told her...

23:00.846 --> 23:02.480
He told her I cost him
his job.

23:02.548 --> 23:03.480
<i> I</i> cost him his job?

23:03.549 --> 23:06.016
No, no. He's playing
innocent victim.

23:06.018 --> 23:07.785
- Mm. She'll find out
the hard way.

23:07.853 --> 23:11.355
(woman over pa):<i> Flight 217</i>
<i> to winnipeg is boarding now</i>

23:11.357 --> 23:12.890
<i> At gate 40.</i>

23:12.958 --> 23:14.091
- Okay, here we go.

23:14.093 --> 23:16.260
(woman):<i> ...217 to winnipeg</i>
<i> is boarding now...</i>

23:16.328 --> 23:19.163
- Oh! God! These skirts are
a metaphor.

23:19.231 --> 23:20.898
They prevent women
from taking big strides.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.499
Forces us to take baby-steps.

23:22.568 --> 23:23.934
- And yet we get there.

23:26.505 --> 23:28.338
- Oh, hey, you!
- Hey!

23:28.407 --> 23:29.907
- So, did you make a move?

23:29.975 --> 23:33.010
- D-- uh... I chickened out.
- Oh! Do it! Come on!

23:33.078 --> 23:34.244
I'm seeing anthony tonight.

23:34.313 --> 23:36.947
- Oh my god! That is so great!
Um, where's your bag?

23:37.015 --> 23:39.316
- Oh, I just travel with
my id and my toothbrush.

23:39.384 --> 23:40.684
That's all I need?

23:40.686 --> 23:43.787
I mean, I used to travel with
so much stuff on all my trips,

23:43.856 --> 23:46.190
But what's the point?
Baggage just weighs you down.

23:46.192 --> 23:47.525
(sam): Yeah.

23:47.593 --> 23:49.193
Oh my god, lorraine, I'm
so sorry, I gotta go.

23:49.261 --> 23:50.360
- Okay.
- Okay!

23:50.429 --> 23:51.462
- Bye!
- Bye.

23:51.464 --> 23:53.397
- Do it, do it, do it...
- I'm gonna do it!

23:53.466 --> 23:55.499
- Do it, do it, do it!
(sam): Doin' it!

23:57.069 --> 23:59.637
(funky music)

24:14.020 --> 24:14.852
(whispering): Oh, excuse me,

24:14.920 --> 24:16.220
Sir, I think you dropped this.

24:16.288 --> 24:18.489
- I don't think so.

24:18.557 --> 24:19.990
Look, I'd be happy to keep it,

24:20.058 --> 24:21.124
But it did fall out
your pocket.

24:21.193 --> 24:22.593
- You don't have to
tell me twice.

24:25.297 --> 24:27.531
(inhaling deeply): Ah.

24:27.599 --> 24:29.266
(both chuckling)

24:32.171 --> 24:34.238
- I got the bag.
(naz): Nice!

24:34.306 --> 24:35.873
- Okay.

24:35.941 --> 24:41.111
Let's see...
What brice is packing.

24:44.250 --> 24:45.482
- Wow.
- Y-yes.

24:45.551 --> 24:48.485
- Brice likes to party, huh?
- Yep, he... Yes.

24:48.554 --> 24:50.587
- Um... Alright, uh, just,
can you hold that?

24:50.656 --> 24:52.055
Thank you.
- Oh, wow. Wow.

24:52.124 --> 24:54.725
- I-I'm not finding any
pink cocaine in here.

24:54.793 --> 24:57.127
- Fbs confirmed there were drugs
on the plane,

24:57.196 --> 24:58.161
But they're not there now...

24:58.230 --> 25:01.565
Someone... Must've...
Got them off.

25:01.633 --> 25:02.867
- Hi.

25:04.336 --> 25:05.669
(softly): Alright, you got it?

25:05.737 --> 25:08.071
- No! There's no drugs
in the bag.

25:08.074 --> 25:09.573
This is just sex toys.

25:13.412 --> 25:15.412
- Are you following me?
Who hired you?

25:15.481 --> 25:18.515
- No. I'm not following anybody.

25:18.584 --> 25:20.584
- Was it her husband?

25:20.652 --> 25:22.152
Candice told me he had her
followed before.

25:22.220 --> 25:23.220
(duff sighs)

25:23.288 --> 25:25.489
- If it's not brice,
it-it's gotta be lorraine.

25:25.557 --> 25:27.191
- But she didn't have
a suitcase on her,

25:27.259 --> 25:29.293
I don't know how she would've
got the drugs off the plane.

25:29.361 --> 25:30.193
- I do. Oh.

25:30.262 --> 25:32.530
- Oh. Oh!

25:33.732 --> 25:35.432
- Can you tell that I have
anything between my legs?

25:35.500 --> 25:37.201
- Can you, huh?
No, you cannot.

25:37.269 --> 25:39.303
You want to know why?
Because of this stupid skirt!

25:39.305 --> 25:41.805
She doesn't need a suitcase
because she is the suitcase.

25:41.873 --> 25:43.373
Duff! Yeah. It's lorraine.

25:43.442 --> 25:45.042
Yeah, we gotta catch her
before she leaves the airport!

25:45.044 --> 25:46.643
Let's go!

25:46.712 --> 25:49.346
- Okay, seriously, dude, I don't
know what you're talking about.

25:49.414 --> 25:51.381
But this candice,
she's trouble.

25:51.450 --> 25:54.051
- Lots of people have affairs,
you know!

25:54.119 --> 25:55.652
It's not illegal!

25:55.721 --> 25:58.655

Lorraine lennon, can we talk?

26:59.518 --> 27:03.220
- Hi. D-- I didn't do
anything... That...

27:05.557 --> 27:06.556
You're a cop?

27:06.625 --> 27:08.191
(breathless): Yeah, I am.

27:08.194 --> 27:09.493
- And you need to come
with us.

27:09.561 --> 27:12.763
- Uh... Don't take me
to the police station,

27:12.831 --> 27:14.231
I'll give you whatever
you want right here.

27:14.299 --> 27:17.101
- Great, I'll take the cocaine
that's between your legs.

27:17.936 --> 27:19.069
- Okay, fine.

27:19.672 --> 27:20.504
(exasperated exhale)

27:20.572 --> 27:22.139
- Oh, oh, oh, lorraine,
not here.

27:22.207 --> 27:24.474
- I knew that I shouldn't
have gotten involved with this,

27:24.543 --> 27:27.344
But... I did and I'm sorry.

27:27.412 --> 27:28.846
- I am not touching that.

27:31.349 --> 27:32.483
- Thank you.

27:33.051 --> 27:34.651
- Okay, so, I'm just gonna--

27:34.720 --> 27:35.986
- Hey, you're actually...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

27:36.054 --> 27:38.422
- ...Very much under arrest.
Stay put.

27:45.631 --> 27:47.497
(door buzzer sounding)

27:47.566 --> 27:49.833
- Oh, god! Yes!

27:49.835 --> 27:51.168
(grunting)

27:51.170 --> 27:53.504
It feels so good to be out of
the shackles of that skirt.

27:53.572 --> 27:55.105
You agree?
- Ugh, yes.

27:55.174 --> 27:58.108
I like big strides
and I cannot lie.

27:58.176 --> 28:01.111
(grunting): You want to take
a big stride

28:01.113 --> 28:02.646
Or do you want to keep going
through life

28:02.648 --> 28:04.781
Being tied at the ankles?
(duff sighs)

28:04.850 --> 28:06.082
- Well, to be honest,

28:06.084 --> 28:09.786
I thought agreeing to smuggle
cocaine was... A big stride.

28:09.855 --> 28:11.254
- It is, really.
She's right.

28:11.257 --> 28:13.056
- Yeah, but it's a big stride
in the wrong direction.

28:13.125 --> 28:14.224
- She's right too.

28:14.292 --> 28:17.861
- Yeah. So, I just-- I won't
do it again, I promise!

28:17.929 --> 28:19.229
- Uh, okay.

28:19.231 --> 28:21.698
Um, lorraine, how about you
tell me who you are working for.

28:21.767 --> 28:22.866
- I don't know.

28:22.935 --> 28:24.735
- Who's paying you?
- Don't know.

28:24.803 --> 28:26.937
They leave the cash
after I drop the package.

28:27.005 --> 28:28.739
- And where do you drop
the package?

28:28.807 --> 28:32.709
- Um... Stasher locker
at the airport.

28:32.778 --> 28:33.910
- Alright. Keep talking.

28:33.979 --> 28:35.345
(sighing)

28:36.215 --> 28:38.815
Locker 27.
I set the password.

28:38.884 --> 28:40.317
- Which is?

28:41.853 --> 28:44.421
- What's the answer to
everything?

28:44.489 --> 28:45.822
- It's true love.

28:45.891 --> 28:47.791
(both chuckling)

28:47.859 --> 28:49.159
Okay. It's her words, not mine.

28:49.227 --> 28:50.761
- Oh, right, okay.

28:50.829 --> 28:52.562
And you don't know
who you're doing this for?

28:52.631 --> 28:54.064
- No. Lo--

28:54.132 --> 28:57.100
Look, this... Really
scary-sounding guy,

28:57.103 --> 28:59.035
He called my hotel room
in mexico

28:59.038 --> 29:02.506
And he knew stuff about me.
Embarrassing stuff.

29:02.574 --> 29:08.178
And he said he would pay me
5000$ a trip. I had no choice.

29:08.180 --> 29:11.448
Just... Please don't tell
my mother about this.

29:11.516 --> 29:13.450
- Your mother's
none of our business.

29:13.518 --> 29:16.686
- Well... Well, she kind of is.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.255
She's the deputy mayor.

29:21.326 --> 29:24.094
Do you kn--
do you know her?

29:24.162 --> 29:25.996
- Yeah, yeah, I do.

29:26.064 --> 29:28.799
- Their drug runner's mother
is deputy mayor marley briggs?

29:28.867 --> 29:29.733
How did they not know this?

29:29.802 --> 29:31.601
- Lorraine has her father's
last name,

29:31.604 --> 29:33.036
The connection
didn't come up.

29:33.104 --> 29:34.905
- This is a nightmare!

29:34.973 --> 29:37.107
I can't believe that
this is happening!

29:37.175 --> 29:41.211
I have a vote this week on your
budget, if this gets out--

29:41.279 --> 29:42.846
- Your daughter is
smuggling drugs

29:42.848 --> 29:45.749
For the pandilla quince.
She stays in our custody.

29:45.751 --> 29:46.716
- She can't.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.552
Lorraine is a diabetic.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.020
You have to let her go.

29:50.088 --> 29:51.121
- We can't.

29:51.189 --> 29:52.622
These are serious charges.

29:52.625 --> 29:54.791
- She is cooperating,
right, commander?

29:54.860 --> 29:57.227
- She's given my detectives
some information

29:57.295 --> 29:58.895
Which may or may not
pan out.

29:58.964 --> 30:01.965
- She will tell you
whatever it is that she knows,

30:02.034 --> 30:05.635
But honestly,
it may not pan out.

30:05.704 --> 30:09.506
Look, I love her,
but she's a nitwit!

30:09.574 --> 30:12.176
She's incredibly naive,
and she always has been.

30:12.244 --> 30:14.511
She lends money to strangers,

30:14.580 --> 30:16.547
She gives out her passwords.

30:16.615 --> 30:18.515
She is being taken advantage of.

30:18.583 --> 30:21.818
She is a victim here,
she is not a criminal.

30:21.887 --> 30:25.889
- Deputy mayor,
we'll see what we can do.

30:25.957 --> 30:28.559
Commander, you can
leave this with me.

30:37.870 --> 30:39.970
(plane engines approaching)

30:42.140 --> 30:43.473
- You think he's gonna show?

30:43.541 --> 30:45.308
- Oh, yeah, he'll show.

30:45.377 --> 30:47.143
Then, we'll arrest him.

30:47.146 --> 30:49.679
And lorraine'll get a free pass.

30:49.748 --> 30:52.215
- Ah. I bet living
with her mother

30:52.284 --> 30:53.516
Is anything but
a free pass.

30:53.585 --> 30:54.818
You know, just because
she has money

30:54.886 --> 30:56.153
Doesn't mean
her life's peachy.

30:56.221 --> 30:57.787
- Yeah, but she still
doesn't<i> need</i> to sell drugs.

30:57.856 --> 30:59.957
- Well, nobody<i> needs</i>
to sell drugs.

31:00.025 --> 31:01.124
- Maybe not.

31:01.192 --> 31:03.093
Some people do it 'cause
they gotta eat.

31:03.095 --> 31:04.161
- Yeah.

31:04.229 --> 31:05.963
- Others do it 'cause they
want to piss mommy off

31:06.031 --> 31:09.800
Or because mommy will
cover it up if they get caught.

31:12.905 --> 31:14.238
- Are you talking about
elliot?

31:15.574 --> 31:16.673
Are you?

31:17.575 --> 31:18.709
Because I didn't cover it up.

31:19.744 --> 31:20.810
I didn't!

31:20.879 --> 31:22.112
They investigated him,

31:22.180 --> 31:23.413
They didn't find
enough evidence.

31:23.481 --> 31:24.981
And he was really helpful...

31:25.050 --> 31:29.319
- He was very...
Privileged is what he was.

31:29.387 --> 31:30.854
And you know it.

31:35.260 --> 31:37.995
- Okay.
Okay.

31:38.863 --> 31:40.797
Here's a question though,
elliot aside,

31:40.865 --> 31:43.400
Like, is it not right for me
to be friends with someone

31:43.468 --> 31:45.101
Who's entitled and privileged,
like, say, lorraine?

31:45.170 --> 31:47.337
- You can like her
all you want.

31:47.339 --> 31:49.272
Oh! Wait a minute!

31:49.341 --> 31:52.676
You and lorraine are
the two peas in a pod.

31:52.744 --> 31:54.678
- Oh my-- no!

31:54.680 --> 31:55.746
No, we are not!

31:55.814 --> 31:57.814
No, we're not! W-we're not!
- Yes.

32:00.619 --> 32:02.619
- Did the deputy mayor
calm down?

32:02.687 --> 32:03.720
- Yes, thankfully.

32:03.789 --> 32:05.422
Once I got lorraine released
on her own recognizance.

32:05.490 --> 32:06.690
- You what?

32:06.758 --> 32:08.191
- Her mother's gonna
keep her at home.

32:08.259 --> 32:09.526
She's not going anywhere.

32:09.528 --> 32:10.593
- We don't even know that

32:10.596 --> 32:11.761
Her tip is gonna amount to
anything!

32:11.830 --> 32:14.731
- She's a diabetic.
She's hypoglycemic.

32:14.799 --> 32:17.100
We don't want her to die
on our watch.

32:17.169 --> 32:19.369
- We need her back
in the morning,

32:19.371 --> 32:23.006
And she's still facing charges.
Am I clear?

32:23.074 --> 32:24.007
- As glass.

32:36.788 --> 32:38.755
- Alright.
Here we go.

32:38.823 --> 32:40.190
- Okay, can you see who it is?

32:40.258 --> 32:41.191
Can you see?
(duff): Uh...

32:41.259 --> 32:42.960
I can't-I can't tell.

32:45.464 --> 32:47.831
(sam): Oh my god.
It's anthony.

32:47.899 --> 32:49.532
- Who?
- Anthony.

32:49.601 --> 32:51.334
Lorraine's boyfriend,
the guy from the airport.

32:51.337 --> 32:53.269
- Of course it is.

32:53.272 --> 32:54.804
Alright. Let's get ready.

32:54.873 --> 32:56.139
When he gets his hands on
the drugs,

32:56.208 --> 32:57.574
Then, we'll head over...

32:58.543 --> 33:01.211
- What is wrong with this idiot,
can he not spell "true love"?

33:05.684 --> 33:07.284
Why isn't he taking the drugs?

33:07.352 --> 33:09.319
We can't arrest him if
he doesn't take the drugs.

33:09.387 --> 33:12.122
- Take it easy, take it easy.
Wait...

33:15.160 --> 33:16.293
What's happening?

33:17.562 --> 33:18.528
Hey!

33:21.967 --> 33:23.100
Hey!

33:28.807 --> 33:30.573
(indistinct chatter
over police radio)

33:30.642 --> 33:32.642
Tell me you've found something
on this anthony guy.

33:32.710 --> 33:33.676
- Oh, yeah. Anthony lewin,

33:33.745 --> 33:35.945
Aka antonio barranco,

33:36.014 --> 33:37.147
Wanted for drug trafficking

33:37.215 --> 33:39.249
And illegal gun possession
in the u.S.

33:39.317 --> 33:40.784
- And possible ties to
the pandilla quince.

33:40.852 --> 33:43.053
- One thing I can say about
lorraine, she's a good liar.

33:43.121 --> 33:45.122
I really did believe she didn't
know who was doing this.

33:45.190 --> 33:46.122
- She may not have known.

33:46.191 --> 33:47.791
He could be totally
manipulating her.

33:47.859 --> 33:49.492
- Well, anthony's
premium flyer miles address is

33:49.561 --> 33:52.062
223 berskin, apartment 411.

33:52.130 --> 33:54.798
- I just got a call
from deputy mayor briggs.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.132
Lorraine has disappeared.

33:56.201 --> 33:58.201
- What do you mean
she disappeared?

33:58.203 --> 34:00.370
You let her go home
with her mother?

34:00.438 --> 34:02.205
Boss...
- Look, I know. I--

34:02.274 --> 34:04.174
I did not have a choice.

34:04.242 --> 34:06.076
And now we've got
bigger fish to fry.

34:06.144 --> 34:07.944
Because briggs thinks that
lorraine has been taken.

34:08.012 --> 34:09.379
Are we still up on her phone?

34:09.447 --> 34:10.747
- Yeah. I'll do you one better.

34:10.749 --> 34:12.149
I've still got
her gps tracking up.

34:12.217 --> 34:17.787
(grunting): She is now
at... 223 berskin ave.

34:17.856 --> 34:19.222
- Anthony's...

34:19.290 --> 34:21.425
- But if he knows she talked
to the cops--

34:21.493 --> 34:22.926
- She's as good as dead.
Let's go.

34:22.928 --> 34:26.263
I need a unit out
at 223 berskin, right now!

34:27.899 --> 34:29.299
(duff): Pj, what's the update?

34:29.367 --> 34:31.301
- We checked anthony's
apartment.

34:31.369 --> 34:32.135
He's not in there.

34:32.203 --> 34:33.503
- No sign of lorraine, either?

34:33.571 --> 34:35.138
Locator says she's still
at this address.

34:35.206 --> 34:36.673
- We covered the doors,
swept the hallway.

34:36.741 --> 34:37.640
No one went in, or out.

34:37.709 --> 34:39.443
- Are you sure you checked
everywhere?

34:39.511 --> 34:40.643
(pj): Yeah.
They're not in there.

34:40.712 --> 34:42.011
Unless they're hiding in
the ceiling tiles.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.914
- That's it.

34:43.982 --> 34:45.181
(both): They're on the roof.

34:45.184 --> 34:47.717
(sam): See, I told you we finish
each other's sentences.

34:54.926 --> 34:56.726
Anthony!
- Stop!

34:57.695 --> 34:59.796
- Let me go,
or I'll push her off.

34:59.864 --> 35:01.531
I will. I swear to god.
(screaming)

35:01.599 --> 35:03.867
- No, no, no, no, no.
You're not gonna do that.

35:03.935 --> 35:05.602
Nobody has to get hurt, okay?
Just take it easy.

35:05.670 --> 35:08.404
- Do it, anthony.
Throw me away!

35:08.407 --> 35:10.473
Throw me!
(sobbing)

35:10.542 --> 35:11.942
(lorraine screams)

35:12.010 --> 35:14.277
(duff): Freeze! In pursuit!
Suspect's on the move!

35:14.279 --> 35:16.279
I'm 10-80! Suspect's on
the south entrance!

35:16.348 --> 35:17.380
(man over radio):<i> Copy.</i>

35:17.448 --> 35:19.316
- I guess true love isn't always
the answer.

35:19.384 --> 35:20.783
(duff in the distance): Freeze!

35:20.852 --> 35:24.187
(panting): "true love" isn't
always the answer.

35:24.189 --> 35:27.157
Like, for example, it wasn't
the answer to the locker code.

35:27.225 --> 35:29.759
Anthony knows
I tell everyone my password,

35:29.827 --> 35:31.961
So he made me choose
something else.

35:31.964 --> 35:36.500
And I told him that if I ever
used "true love" as a code,

35:36.568 --> 35:37.967
It means there's a problem.

35:38.036 --> 35:40.670
- Yeah.
- Clever, right?

35:40.738 --> 35:42.038
He loves me.

35:42.106 --> 35:45.141
- Yeah. I guess "throw me away"
was also a code?

35:45.210 --> 35:47.177
- Yeah. You're not as dumb
as you look.

35:47.179 --> 35:48.478
- I don't know.

35:48.546 --> 35:50.714
I kind of am, lorraine.
I think I'm super duper dumb.

35:50.782 --> 35:54.150
'cause here I thought you were
this sweet, kind person.

35:54.219 --> 35:55.518
Standing by the door.

35:55.587 --> 35:56.886
Blocking the way --

35:56.955 --> 35:58.721
(naz grunting)
(lorraine screaming)

35:58.790 --> 36:00.156
(naz): Don't move!

36:00.225 --> 36:01.525
(lorraine panting)

36:06.932 --> 36:09.866
- Girlfriend,
I also speak code.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.803
Hey.
- Hi.

36:15.440 --> 36:18.141
- Hey! Hey! Don't do it!

36:18.210 --> 36:20.076
- Put your hands up.
Get 'em up!

36:20.878 --> 36:22.212
- You gonna shoot me?

36:22.280 --> 36:26.016
- Nah. We're gonna bring you in
peacefully, without incident.

36:26.084 --> 36:28.184
Just like we do.

36:28.253 --> 36:30.353
- If I were you,
I'd let me go.

36:30.421 --> 36:32.255
If you apprehend me,
they'll retaliate.

36:32.323 --> 36:33.390
- Who is that?

36:34.359 --> 36:35.358
The pandilla quince?

36:35.427 --> 36:37.894
- How many times do we have to
arrest you guys

36:37.963 --> 36:39.296
Before you get the hint?

36:39.364 --> 36:42.432
- Your funeral.
I warned you.

36:42.434 --> 36:44.734
- Yeah, you did. Come on.

36:57.849 --> 36:59.782
(joyful humming and laughter)

36:59.785 --> 37:01.251
- Good work today, you two.

37:01.253 --> 37:03.586
- Thanks. So, what's the word
on lorraine?

37:03.655 --> 37:07.257
- Detained. But now, I have to
tip-toe around my superiors

37:07.259 --> 37:09.259
Who'll want to offer her
a plea deal

37:09.327 --> 37:11.594
Because they're all afraid
we're gonna get our budget cut.

37:11.663 --> 37:12.762
(duff): Tiptoe nothing.

37:12.830 --> 37:14.130
You're the boss.

37:14.199 --> 37:15.331
Take big strides.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.166
- Yeah, I think we've all
had enough baby steps.

37:17.235 --> 37:19.469
We're all ready
to spread our legs wide open.

37:19.537 --> 37:20.870
(duff sighs)
- no.

37:20.938 --> 37:23.039
- I was speaking
metaphorically.

37:23.108 --> 37:25.608
- See? This is what I'm saying.

37:25.677 --> 37:27.343
'cause no peas in my pod

37:27.346 --> 37:28.878
Would ever talk to our boss
like that.

37:28.946 --> 37:31.014
- Uh! I was speaking
in metaphors.

37:31.082 --> 37:32.915
Peas, metaphor. Skirts,
what are they?

37:32.984 --> 37:34.350
Oh, I don't know,
a metaphor!

37:34.419 --> 37:35.852
And that's what we do now,
we metaphor!

37:42.361 --> 37:44.861
Uh... Hey, nathan?

37:46.131 --> 37:47.664
You got a minute? I...

37:47.732 --> 37:49.499
I nee- want to tell you
something.

37:50.568 --> 37:51.834
- Okay.

37:51.903 --> 37:55.772
Uh...
(sighing): Okay. So...

37:57.376 --> 37:59.175
I hate flying.

37:59.243 --> 38:03.647
Hm. But I also know that
when you're on the plane,

38:03.715 --> 38:05.982
You can't ride around
on the tarmac all day.

38:05.984 --> 38:08.818
You know, you're on the plane,
you need to take off.

38:08.886 --> 38:12.388
- Uh... I'm not following.

38:12.457 --> 38:15.659
- Right, yeah, yeah. Okay,
uh...

38:15.727 --> 38:21.531
(inhaling deeply): What I'm
trying to say is that...

38:21.599 --> 38:25.302
It's not your fault...
That we didn't work out.

38:27.072 --> 38:28.571
You shouldn't have taken things
slower.

38:28.639 --> 38:31.641
I should have let it happen.

38:33.211 --> 38:38.248
Look. I've never been good
at relationships.

38:40.218 --> 38:43.153
And that's not on you,
that's on me, okay?

38:44.489 --> 38:45.989
- I want to end it with
gabrielle.

38:47.225 --> 38:48.758
She's great, I...

38:48.826 --> 38:50.193
It's never going anywhere

38:50.261 --> 38:51.561
As long as you're in
the picture.

38:52.897 --> 38:54.698
So, the only question is...

38:55.933 --> 38:57.967
Are you in the picture?

39:00.972 --> 39:02.105
- Yeah.

39:03.108 --> 39:06.176
I'm in the picture.

39:09.647 --> 39:12.282
- Okay.
- Okay.

39:14.352 --> 39:18.421
- Can you give me a bit of time
to sort my stuff out?

39:18.489 --> 39:21.157
- Yeah. Okay.

39:21.225 --> 39:23.093
(sighing with relief): Okay.

39:24.596 --> 39:25.829
(softly): Alright.

39:27.899 --> 39:29.098
(he clears his throat)

39:29.167 --> 39:30.800
(door buzzer sounding)

39:32.703 --> 39:34.270
(indistinct chatter)

39:34.272 --> 39:35.438
- Hey, duff.
- Hey.

39:35.506 --> 39:37.340
- Shottipper went off again
over in marshall court.

39:37.408 --> 39:40.209
(scoffing): Oh my god,
it's just fireworks!

39:40.278 --> 39:43.212
- I know, but someone from g&g's
gotta check it out.

39:43.281 --> 39:45.314
I'll go with you.
- Oh, no.

39:45.383 --> 39:46.549
Uh, I can do it.

39:46.618 --> 39:48.985
- Uniforms need a sergeant
over there anyway.

39:49.053 --> 39:51.954
I'm working the night shift,
so...

39:52.023 --> 39:53.390
It'll make the time
go faster.

39:54.559 --> 39:57.494
- Yeah, sure, gabrielle.
After you.

39:58.563 --> 40:01.231
(sighing)

40:04.035 --> 40:05.802
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:05.870 --> 40:07.103
- You alright?

40:07.171 --> 40:08.071
- Yeah.

40:09.908 --> 40:11.841
I'd like to have sex
with you.

40:11.910 --> 40:13.510
And I'd like to do it
tonight.

40:15.180 --> 40:16.246
- Ah.

40:19.283 --> 40:21.317
- I have been thinking
about this for so long.

40:21.385 --> 40:22.752
- Really? 'cause I thought that

40:22.820 --> 40:24.921
You wanted to take it slow.
- Oh my god, no, no, no!

40:24.923 --> 40:26.222
I thought you wanted
to take it slow.

40:26.290 --> 40:27.924
- I don't.
- You don't? Okay. Let's just...

40:27.992 --> 40:29.592
Yeah, take off--

40:29.594 --> 40:31.127
Just grab-grab from the back!
Grab from the back!

40:31.195 --> 40:32.728
- It's caught on my chin.
- Sorry.

40:32.731 --> 40:34.330
- It's caught on my chin.
- Are you okay?

40:34.398 --> 40:35.531
I don't want to--
- pull, pull, pull.

40:35.600 --> 40:37.000
Yeah, okay.
- There we go!

40:37.068 --> 40:38.534
- That's great! No, it's good.
Just really--

40:38.603 --> 40:39.735
Okay.
- Okay.

40:39.804 --> 40:40.737
- Do you want to go upstairs

40:40.805 --> 40:42.104
Or do you want to do it
down here?

40:42.173 --> 40:44.040
- I feel like we should start
down here, couple good times,

40:44.108 --> 40:45.808
And then, move on up?
- That's a really good idea.

40:45.811 --> 40:47.310
- Right?
- Can I just say, "thank you"?

40:47.378 --> 40:48.945
Yes. That's... Amazing. Okay.
- Thank you.

40:49.013 --> 40:50.713
How does this, uh...
- It's a double.

40:50.781 --> 40:52.515
- Is that a double knot?
- It is. But then,

40:52.583 --> 40:53.883
I have an extra-thick sockette
on as well.

40:53.951 --> 40:55.718
- For sure.
- You're just gonna have to...

40:55.787 --> 40:56.552
- Samantha!

40:56.621 --> 40:57.386
(sam): Can you just ta--

40:57.455 --> 40:59.222
Oh my god! Mom?!
- Wow.

40:59.290 --> 41:01.491
- Where is your dignity?

41:01.493 --> 41:02.992
(sam): Uh...
- Put your clothes on,

41:03.060 --> 41:05.295
You dirty dogs.
The curtains aren't even closed.

41:05.363 --> 41:08.264
- Uh... I'm so sorry, I, uh...
- This is, uh...

41:08.332 --> 41:10.099
(clears throat): This is
taai nazeer, he's, uh...

41:10.168 --> 41:11.100
He's my co-colleague.

41:11.168 --> 41:12.802
- Yeah, no, we-we work together.

41:12.870 --> 41:14.036
It's a pleasure to meet you.

41:14.105 --> 41:15.938
- Oh. So, this is what I get

41:16.007 --> 41:18.508
For trying to surprise
my daughter.

41:18.576 --> 41:21.678
I get some stranger's...
Crotch in my face?

41:23.048 --> 41:24.947
- I'm sorry. I'm gonna go, I--
- yep.

41:25.016 --> 41:26.582
- It's probably...
- Are you sure?

41:26.651 --> 41:28.351
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah? Okay.

41:28.419 --> 41:29.452
It was lovely to s--

41:29.521 --> 41:31.454
Spend time with you.
- Yeah. No, for sure.

41:31.522 --> 41:32.255
We should...

41:32.323 --> 41:33.189
(sam): We're gonna.
- Yeah.

41:33.257 --> 41:34.657
Bye.
- Bye.

41:34.725 --> 41:36.592
What are you doing here?

41:36.661 --> 41:38.461
- My bunion surgery got
moved up.

41:38.529 --> 41:39.896
I'm here for six weeks.

41:39.964 --> 41:41.964
- Uh. Elliot, he-he's supposed
to be with you, in florida!

41:42.033 --> 41:44.767
- He is, he's taking such good
care of the place.

41:44.835 --> 41:48.738
Him and sweet jackie,
they're so cute.

41:48.740 --> 41:52.441
Wow, it's bland in here,

41:52.444 --> 41:55.144
Looks like it was decorated
by mannequins.

41:55.146 --> 41:56.312
- Thank you.

41:58.983 --> 41:59.816
(dog barking)

41:59.884 --> 42:01.250
(indistinct chatter on
police radio)

42:01.319 --> 42:03.853
(duff sighing)

42:03.921 --> 42:05.388
(gabrielle): No fireworks.

42:05.456 --> 42:08.024
- No, but there. Just look.

42:08.092 --> 42:11.294
There are empty shells
all over this place.

42:11.362 --> 42:13.029
Pff. Jeez.
- Well,

42:13.097 --> 42:15.632
I'm glad I had
the excuse to come anyway.

42:18.102 --> 42:20.436
I don't want things to be weird
because I'm dating your ex.

42:20.504 --> 42:23.105
- Yeah. I d--
(sighing): It's okay.

42:23.174 --> 42:25.174
- Admit it. It is weird.

42:25.176 --> 42:26.909
Working with your ex.

42:26.978 --> 42:30.746
You with nathan,
me with michaels.

42:30.815 --> 42:33.783
- Wait. You dated ds michaels?

42:33.851 --> 42:35.484
- I know, right?

42:35.553 --> 42:37.653
I haven't even told nathan yet.

42:37.722 --> 42:39.255
Not that he'd mind.

42:39.257 --> 42:42.325
Nathan's probably
the nicest guy I've ever met.

42:42.393 --> 42:43.960
Honestly, it's the first time

42:43.962 --> 42:45.428
I've felt hopeful about--
(gunshot blasts)

42:45.496 --> 42:46.663
(gabrielle's breath shudders)

42:46.731 --> 42:48.531
(duff breaths quickly)

42:48.533 --> 42:49.932
(man): Everyone down!

42:50.001 --> 42:53.937
(gasping)
(duff): Gabrielle. Gabrielle!

42:54.839 --> 42:55.604
Gabrielle!

42:55.674 --> 42:58.007
(man): Team two,
form a perimeter!

43:00.145 --> 43:03.145
- Got a 10-33 in marshall court.
Shots fired, officer down.

43:03.148 --> 43:05.415
I need an ambulance, now!
(woman):<i> Copy that.</i>

43:05.483 --> 43:07.883
- I'm here. Just hang on.
Okay, look at me.

43:07.952 --> 43:10.186
Open your eyes. Look at me!
You're gonna be okay.

43:10.254 --> 43:11.888
(gabrielle gasping)
you're gonna be okay.

43:11.956 --> 43:45.287
(rasping)
(softly): My god.
