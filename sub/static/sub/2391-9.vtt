30:50.680 --> 30:52.045
SOUNDS TO ME, VERONICA,

30:52.050 --> 30:53.642
LIKE YOU'VE BEEN DRINKING
THE KOOL-AID.

30:53.650 --> 30:54.674
I HAVE NOT.

30:54.680 --> 30:56.216
YOU BETTER RECOGNIZE.

30:56.220 --> 30:59.348
THANK YOU FOR BEING MY OWN
PERSONAL "SPRINGER" AUDIENCE.

30:59.350 --> 31:02.080
SHOULD I CHECK MYSELF
BEFORE I WRECK MYSELF?

31:02.090 --> 31:03.409
ALL I'M SAYING IS

31:03.420 --> 31:05.752
IS YOU MAY BE GETTING
A LITTLE SOFT.

31:05.760 --> 31:07.580
RIGHT, AND I'M --

31:07.590 --> 31:08.955
HEY, VERONICA...

31:08.960 --> 31:11.269
LISTEN, I'VE GOT TO GO VISIT
MY GRANDMA

31:11.270 --> 31:13.192
IN THE HOSPITAL
AFTER SCHOOL.

31:13.200 --> 31:14.792
DO YOU WANT
TO COME WITH ME?

31:14.800 --> 31:17.496
YEAH, SURE, CASEY,
I'D LOVE TO.

31:17.500 --> 31:18.899
OKAY.

31:22.880 --> 31:25.849
Soft. Soft.

31:25.850 --> 31:29.809
IT'S SO HARD
TO SEE HER THIS WAY.

31:29.820 --> 31:32.789
WANT TO HEAR
SOMETHING SAD?

31:32.790 --> 31:34.951
SURE.

31:34.960 --> 31:39.420
MY PARENTS' FORTUNE --
EVERY LAST NICKEL OF IT --

31:39.430 --> 31:42.024
COMES FROM GRANDMA'S
PUBLISHING COMPANY.

31:42.030 --> 31:43.850
MOM AND DAD
HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

31:43.860 --> 31:46.169
GRANDMA PROVIDED
FOR EVERYTHING.

31:46.170 --> 31:49.435
THEN, A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO
WHEN SHE STARTED HAVING STROKES,

31:49.440 --> 31:53.035
STARTED FORGETTING STUFF...
MY PARENTS,

31:53.040 --> 31:55.929
WHO CALL HER "GRANDMONSTER"
BEHIND HER BACK,

31:55.940 --> 31:59.103
JUST STOPPED PAYING
ANY ATTENTION TO HER.

32:00.550 --> 32:03.417
IT'S AMAZING HOW MUCH BETTER
THEY STARTED TREATING ME

32:03.420 --> 32:05.308
ONCE THEY FOUND OUT
THAT SHE DECIDED

32:05.320 --> 32:07.345
TO LEAVE
ALL OF HER MONEY TO ME.

32:08.990 --> 32:10.958
SO, HOW LONG
HAVE THEY KNOWN

32:10.960 --> 32:13.258
SHE WAS WILLING HER MONEY
TO YOU?

32:13.260 --> 32:16.696
THEY'VE KNOWN
FOR A YEAR.

32:32.950 --> 32:34.941
I WISH
I COULD COME WITH YOU.

32:34.950 --> 32:37.646
I KNOW.

32:37.650 --> 32:40.380
THANKS FOR SPENDING
ALL THIS TIME WITH ME.

32:41.620 --> 32:43.918
YOU KNOW,
IF YOU WANTED TO, YOU COULD.

32:43.920 --> 32:46.718
Veronica:
CRAZY THING -- I DO WANT TO.

33:10.080 --> 33:12.184
RAIN?

33:26.030 --> 33:29.864
THAT MUST BE
GOOD MILK.

33:29.870 --> 33:32.805
RECOGNIZE HER?

33:33.840 --> 33:36.832
THAT'S RAIN, ONE OF THE GIRLS
FROM THE COLLECTIVE.

33:36.840 --> 33:39.240
REAL NAME --
"DEBBIE MEYER."

33:39.250 --> 33:42.344
SHE'S A RUNAWAY,
A MINOR.

33:45.290 --> 33:48.157
SO, WE OUGHT TO CALL
THE GANT FAMILY RIGHT AWAY.

33:48.160 --> 33:50.151
HOLD IT.
HOLD IT, PLEASE, DAD.

33:50.160 --> 33:52.481
LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS
FOR A MINUTE.

33:54.060 --> 33:55.618
THIS IS
WHAT WE'RE WORKING FOR.

33:55.630 --> 33:59.418
WE WERE PRAYING FOR A BREAK,
AND NOW YOU GAVE IT TO US.

33:59.430 --> 34:00.727
DON'T TELL ME
THE PROSPECT

34:00.730 --> 34:02.960
OF HAVING NEW DIGS
AND STEADY HOT WATER

34:02.970 --> 34:04.835
DOESN'T SOUND GOOD
TO YOU.

34:04.840 --> 34:07.308
AND WE CAN'T JUST
BLOW THIS OFF, VERONICA.

34:07.310 --> 34:09.972
THEY'RE CONTRIBUTING
TO THE DELINQUENCY OF A MINOR.

34:09.980 --> 34:11.447
IT'S A SERIOUS CRIME.

34:11.450 --> 34:14.442
OH, PLEASE, DAD,
YOU'VE BEEN AROUND THESE PEOPLE.

34:14.450 --> 34:17.715
DO YOU HONESTLY THINK
THEY'RE CORRUPTING ANYONE?

34:17.720 --> 34:20.086
I THINK THEY'RE EXACTLY
WHAT THEY SEEM TO BE --

34:20.090 --> 34:22.888
A BUNCH OF SWEET, NAIVE,
'605 TH ROWBACKS.

34:22.890 --> 34:25.222
THAT'S POSSIBLY TRUE, BUT
DEFINITELY BESIDE THE POINT.

34:25.230 --> 34:29.326
EVEN IF THEY ARE THE UTOPIAN
SWEETH EARTS YOU THINK THEY ARE,

34:29.330 --> 34:32.163
WE DON'T ANSWER,
MORALLY OR OTHERWISE,

34:32.170 --> 34:33.797

34:33.800 --> 34:36.564
WE ANSWER TO OUR CLIENTS
WHO PAY US TO DO A JOB,

34:36.570 --> 34:40.404
AND THAT JOB IS TO FIND
THE INFORMATION THEY WANT.

34:47.950 --> 34:49.747
HEY, VERONICA.

34:49.750 --> 34:52.639
CASEY TOLD ME YOU WERE OUT
AT THE FARM LAST NIGHT.

34:52.650 --> 34:54.811
I WISH YOU COULD HAVE
STAYED AWHILE.

34:54.820 --> 34:56.253
IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL.

34:56.260 --> 34:58.148
THE MOON WAS SO BRIGHT
YOU COULD ALMOST READ BY IT.

34:58.160 --> 35:02.051
HOLLY, THERE'S SOMETHING YOU
NEED TO KNOW ABOUT, RIGHT NOW.

35:02.060 --> 35:05.063
THE THING IS,
I WORK FOR MY DAD,

35:05.070 --> 35:08.392
WHO'S A PRIVATE DETECTIVE,
OKAY, AND...

35:12.870 --> 35:16.636
MR. CLEMMONS JUST CALLED ME
TO HIS OFFICE.

35:18.180 --> 35:21.741
MY GRANDMA DIED
THIS MORNING.

35:21.750 --> 35:24.116
OH, CASEY...

35:26.790 --> 35:29.384
[ SNIFFS ]

35:29.390 --> 35:35.158
* LAY DOWN YOUR ARMS
AND SAIL WITH ME *

35:35.160 --> 35:41.269
* MY MELODY IS SHAKY *

35:41.270 --> 35:48.233
* YOU SAID YOU KNEW
WHEN WE FIRST MET *

35:48.240 --> 35:50.674
JOSH...

35:50.680 --> 35:52.671
HOLLY...

35:52.680 --> 35:55.672
I'VE DONE SOMETHING
I REGRET.

35:55.680 --> 35:57.318
I FOUND OUT
THAT RAIN WAS A RUNAWAY.

35:57.320 --> 35:59.117
I TOLD MY DAD
ABOUT IT.

35:59.120 --> 36:02.749
YOU HAVE TO GET HER
THE HELL OUT OF HERE RIGHT AWAY.

36:02.760 --> 36:04.113
WE GET THE PICTURE.

36:04.120 --> 36:05.826
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE
JUST FINE.

36:05.830 --> 36:07.786
WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING
UP FRONT.

36:07.790 --> 36:08.859
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE US.

36:08.860 --> 36:11.192
COME JOIN US LATER
IF YOU'D LIKE.

36:11.200 --> 36:15.398
THANKS, JOSH.
I WON'T KEEP HIM LONG.

36:19.040 --> 36:22.237
I APPRECIATED
YOU BEING HERE.

36:22.240 --> 36:25.573
FOR NO REASON
THAT I CAN SEE,

36:25.580 --> 36:27.571
YOU'VE BEEN A REAL FRIEND
TO ME LATELY.

36:27.580 --> 36:31.641
CAN YOU REALLY SAY THAT
AFTER WHAT I JUST TOLD YOU?

36:31.650 --> 36:34.813
I GUESS I DON'T THINK
YOU WERE FAKING THE KINDNESS.

36:34.820 --> 36:37.755
AM I WRONG?

36:40.160 --> 36:43.789
WELL, I GUESS I BETTER GO HAVE
THIS CONVERSATION

36:43.800 --> 36:45.199
WITH MY PARENTS.

36:45.200 --> 36:48.692
THEY WANT TO HEAR THAT
I'M NOT GONNA LET THEM STARVE.

37:11.060 --> 37:12.857
HEY!
WHAT ARE YOU --

37:14.600 --> 37:15.749
HEY!

37:17.660 --> 37:19.867
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO HIM?

37:19.870 --> 37:21.963
STOP!

37:21.970 --> 37:23.437
STOP!

37:29.040 --> 37:30.576
DAD?

37:30.580 --> 37:32.775
WE HAVE TO CALL THE POLICE.
CASEY'S JUST BEEN KIDNAPPED.

37:32.780 --> 37:35.214
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT --
KIDNAPPED BY WHO?

37:35.220 --> 37:36.778
BY HIS PARENTS

37:36.780 --> 37:39.248
AND THAT CREEPY GUY THAT WAS
WITH THEM AT THE LAST MEETING.

37:39.250 --> 37:40.888
THEY GRABBED HIM
AT THE FUNERAL

37:40.890 --> 37:43.211
AND SHOVED HIM IN THE LIMO
AND DROVE AWAY.

37:43.220 --> 37:44.528
THEY GRABBED HIM?

37:44.530 --> 37:46.589
SO, IT WAS
AGAINST HIS WILL, THEN?

37:46.590 --> 37:47.852
HE TRIED TO GET AWAY?

37:47.860 --> 37:49.396
IT'S NOT LIKE
HE WAS RUNNING FROM THEM.

37:49.400 --> 37:50.924
I WAS
KIND OF FAR AWAY,

37:50.930 --> 37:53.421
BUT I COULD TELL HE WAS
SURPRISED BY WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

37:53.430 --> 37:56.137
OKAY...

37:56.140 --> 37:58.358
OKAY...
I WASN'T THERE.

37:58.370 --> 37:59.803
YOU SAW WHAT YOU SAW.

37:59.810 --> 38:01.835
I'M NOT DOUBTING
YOUR INTERPRETATION.

38:01.840 --> 38:04.547
BUT...
IF I WAS STILL SHERIFF,

38:04.550 --> 38:07.576
AND SOMEBODY TOLD ME AN
18-YEAR-OLD KID GOT INTO A CAR

38:07.580 --> 38:10.413
WITH HIS PARENTS AFTER
HIS GRANDMOTHER'S FUNERAL,

38:10.420 --> 38:12.809
WELL, THERE'S NOTHING
I COULD DO ABOUT IT...

38:12.820 --> 38:14.959
NOT FOR A COUPLE
OF DAYS ANYWAY,

38:14.960 --> 38:18.214
SO, LET'S JUST HOLD OFF,
SEE WHAT HAPPENS, OKAY?

38:18.220 --> 38:19.881
I WISH WE HADN'T
TURNED OVER

38:19.890 --> 38:22.893
THAT INFORMATION
ABOUT THE COLLECTIVE.

38:22.900 --> 38:25.289
WE DIDN'T.

38:25.300 --> 38:27.791
WHAT?
YOU DIDN'T --

38:27.800 --> 38:28.892
MNH-MNH.

38:28.900 --> 38:31.437
I THOUGHT ABOUT
WHAT YOU SAID,

38:31.440 --> 38:34.238
WHAT I HEARD ON THE WIRETAP,
AND YOU WERE RIGHT.

38:34.240 --> 38:38.199
ONCE YOU GET PAST ALL
THE '605 TH EME-PARK TRAPPINGS,

38:38.210 --> 38:42.340
THAT COMMUNITY'S A LOT MORE
WHOLESOME AND FUNCTIONAL

38:42.350 --> 38:44.818
THAN, JUST FOR EXAMPLE,
NEPTUNE IS.

38:47.150 --> 38:50.711
I ALSO DID A LITTLE CHECKING
ON DEBBIE MEYER.

IN FOUR FOSTER HOMES

EIGHT YEARS OLD --

38:57.030 --> 39:00.864
REPORTS OF SERIOUS ABUSE
IN AT LEAST TWO,

39:00.870 --> 39:03.259
AND I HAD
TO ADMIT IT --

39:03.270 --> 39:06.660

WHERE SHE IS.

WITH EACH DAY THAT PASSES,

39:21.290 --> 39:25.420

I DIDN'T NOTICE THE SACRIFICE.

39:43.080 --> 39:45.048
MY PLEASURE.

39:48.520 --> 39:50.249
I SENT OFF
FOR THOSE TEST RESULTS

39:50.250 --> 39:51.808
BECAUSE I WANTED THE TRUTH.

39:51.820 --> 39:54.857
BUT CAN A LAB TECH REALLY SEE
THE SHAPE OF MY SOUL

39:54.860 --> 39:56.885

OF GENES?
