47:21.051 --> 47:23.384
to so many people. Never.

47:23.419 --> 47:26.788
You do have a responsibility to
assess the impact of your work

47:26.823 --> 47:29.390
and to understand the damage that comes

47:29.425 --> 47:33.161
from the incessant,
repetitive, mindless violence

47:33.196 --> 47:37.932
and irresponsible conduct that
permeates our media all the time.

47:37.968 --> 47:39.934
Bob Dole: <i>A line has been crossed,</i>

47:39.970 --> 47:44.271

human dignity and decency.

47:47.576 --> 47:51.545

Well, it's not all right.

47:51.580 --> 47:53.580
Those pay who them
have a responsibility.

47:53.615 --> 47:56.416
The corporate executives who
hide behind the lofty language

47:56.451 --> 47:58.552
of free speech should understand this:

47:58.587 --> 48:02.522
<i>We will name their names and shame
them as they deserve to be shamed.</i>

48:02.558 --> 48:04.692
- Both: Time Warner.
- Man: <i>Time Warner's the biggest.</i>

48:04.727 --> 48:06.827
Time Warner owns
a company called Interscope...

48:06.862 --> 48:09.129
The Death Row-Interscope coup.

48:09.165 --> 48:10.831
Dole: <i>Which columnist John Leo called</i>

48:10.866 --> 48:14.501
<i>the "cultural equivalent of owning half
the world's mustard gas factories."</i>

48:14.536 --> 48:16.769
Joe Lieberman: <i>To me, this
music is the equivalent</i>

48:16.805 --> 48:18.437
of yelling, "Fire,"
in a crowded theater.

48:18.472 --> 48:21.841
The fire starts.
Meanwhile, simultaneously...

48:21.876 --> 48:23.475
The media and entertainment industries

48:23.511 --> 48:24.911
are buzzing over what may become

48:24.946 --> 48:27.080
the third mega-media
merger of the summer.

48:27.115 --> 48:30.149
<i>The deal would create the biggest
media company in the world,</i>

48:30.185 --> 48:33.385
<i>but both sides say there are still
major issues to be worked out.</i>

48:33.421 --> 48:36.022
Because of the proposed merger
with Turner,

48:36.057 --> 48:39.525
<i>Time Warner needs tremendous
amounts of regulatory approval,</i>

48:39.560 --> 48:42.561
<i>and want to be looked at
with a great deal of favor.</i>

48:42.597 --> 48:44.197
Iovine: <i>Jerry Levin
called me in his office</i>

48:44.232 --> 48:45.631
<i>in the height of the insanity,</i>

48:45.666 --> 48:47.200
<i>and Jerry was a very decent man.</i>

48:47.235 --> 48:48.400
<i>He was the CEO of Time Warner.</i>

48:48.436 --> 48:52.070
<i>He said, "Jimmy, my son
teaches with Tupac's lyrics</i>

48:52.106 --> 48:55.140
<i>in Harlem. I get it."
He said, "I got a problem.</i>

48:55.175 --> 48:58.510
<i>"Dole has got the cable bill,
I need his help,</i>

48:58.546 --> 49:01.213
<i>and I gotta sacrifice something."</i>

49:01.249 --> 49:03.449
So I said, "That sounds reasonable."

49:03.484 --> 49:04.883
But that's his problem.

49:04.918 --> 49:06.184
Newsman: <i>All this means
continuing headaches</i>

49:06.220 --> 49:09.588
<i>for new Time Warner Music
Group Chairman Michael Fuchs.</i>

49:09.624 --> 49:11.923
Fuchs: I was coming into chaos.

49:11.959 --> 49:14.660
This is probably
why I was given the job.

49:14.695 --> 49:18.029
<i>The board was sick of what was going on,</i>

49:18.065 --> 49:22.333
<i>so I was told,
"It's time to clean house."</i>

49:22.369 --> 49:26.471
Maybe they thought I should be more
respectful or something, you know?

49:26.506 --> 49:27.972
Iovine: <i>We meet with Michael Fuchs.</i>

49:28.007 --> 49:29.874
<i>He says, "For the next six months,</i>

49:29.909 --> 49:32.477
I'm gonna evaluate
each and every one of you,"

49:32.512 --> 49:33.578
and he points to me as well.

49:33.613 --> 49:36.147
And he goes, "I'm the Michael
Jordan of management."

49:36.182 --> 49:38.149
<i>So, I look at Michael Fuchs, and I said,</i>

49:38.184 --> 49:40.117
"But, Michael, this is baseball."

49:40.153 --> 49:42.487
This guy went nuclear.

49:42.522 --> 49:43.954
Jim Moret: <i>Time Warner's music division</i>

49:43.990 --> 49:45.723
<i>has been in turmoil for months.</i>

49:45.759 --> 49:48.293
Heads have been rolling
as the new Boss cleans house

49:48.328 --> 49:49.527
while the company remains

49:49.562 --> 49:51.929
under attack from foes
of gangsta rap music.

49:51.964 --> 49:54.899
Newsman: <i> Fuchs spent the summer
ousting the rap label's defender,</i>

49:54.934 --> 49:57.335
<i>Doug Morris,
from his chief executive post.</i>

49:57.370 --> 49:59.569
Michael Fuchs just panicked.

49:59.605 --> 50:01.505
Fuchs: <i>I fired Doug. I felt there was</i>

50:01.540 --> 50:04.775
a loyalty to the music industry,

50:04.810 --> 50:07.711
but not necessarily loyalty
to the company.

50:07.746 --> 50:09.145
We were doing great,

50:09.181 --> 50:11.448
and suddenly we're out the window,

50:11.483 --> 50:13.517
going splat on the pavement.

50:13.552 --> 50:14.818
Not him. Me first.

50:14.853 --> 50:17.354
I hated the fact that it was me first.

50:17.389 --> 50:20.557
The music business is very tight,

50:20.592 --> 50:22.726
tight like a pack of thieves, you know.

50:22.761 --> 50:25.462
You got some guys
from Brooklyn in this war

50:25.497 --> 50:30.099
with all of these enormously
powerful entities.

50:30.135 --> 50:33.937
<i>And Time Warner's first instinct</i>

50:33.972 --> 50:37.473
<i>was to buy the whole thing
and attempt to clean it up...</i>

50:37.508 --> 50:41.544
<i>Death Row Records...
which was an absurdity.</i>

50:55.626 --> 50:58.027
Iovine: <i>I get a phone call at
midnight from Suge Knight.</i>

50:58.063 --> 51:00.897
And he says to me, "Yo, who's the
guy we hate at Time Warner?"

51:00.932 --> 51:03.299
I said, "Michael Fuchs."
He goes, "Yeah, that's him.

51:03.335 --> 51:05.869
"They want me
to meet him and Melba Moore,

51:05.904 --> 51:09.739
and Dionne Warwick at Dionne's
house tomorrow morning."

51:10.975 --> 51:13.576
I said, "Where? Who?

51:13.611 --> 51:17.580
<i>Melba Moore, Dionne Warwick,
and Michael Fuchs?"</i>

51:17.615 --> 51:20.583
<i>"Yeah, and they're getting the
mayor of Compton to come."</i>

51:20.618 --> 51:23.786
I'm like, "What the fuck
is this guy doing?"

51:23.821 --> 51:27.857
I was told to police
the lyrics a little more.

51:27.892 --> 51:29.992
Iovine: <i>"Michael Fuchs wants
to talk to me about a deal."</i>

51:30.027 --> 51:33.396
Fuchs: <i>Dionne Warwick
said, "Fly out here.</i>

51:33.431 --> 51:35.964
"Suge's like my nephew.
He lives in the neighborhood.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.567
<i>He'll come over.
You'll talk about things."</i>

51:38.603 --> 51:40.503
I'm a partner of his.

51:40.538 --> 51:43.739
We own the label as much as he does.

51:43.775 --> 51:47.776
<i>For him to fly out and meet
with one of our major labels</i>

51:47.811 --> 51:50.512
without calling us is unacceptable

51:50.547 --> 51:52.480
in any form of business.

51:52.516 --> 51:53.948
<i>So I call Suge. I said, "Suge,</i>

51:53.983 --> 51:57.519
<i>meet me tomorrow morning at
Jerry's Deli at eight o'clock."</i>

51:57.554 --> 51:59.421
<i>So, I go to Jerry's Deli,</i>

51:59.456 --> 52:02.056
<i>I meet Suge and David
Kenner, Suge's lawyer,</i>

52:02.091 --> 52:05.827
<i>and I know that if Suge
walks into that meeting,</i>

52:05.862 --> 52:08.129
<i>Michael Fuchs... he would do anything</i>

52:08.164 --> 52:10.298
<i>to either put Interscope out of business</i>

52:10.333 --> 52:12.366
<i>or get this thing done
with these lyrics.</i>

52:12.402 --> 52:14.869
<i>So, Suge and I were gonna
stay in that restaurant</i>

52:14.905 --> 52:18.872
<i>with David Kenner and just wait
until Michael Fuchs left.</i>

52:18.908 --> 52:21.174
Dionne kept trying to call Suge.

52:21.209 --> 52:22.175
Iovine: <i>And Suge was incredible.</i>

52:22.210 --> 52:25.011
<i>So every time,
Warwick would call and say,</i>

52:25.047 --> 52:26.613
<i>"Hi, baby, when are you getting here?"</i>

52:26.649 --> 52:29.483
He would say, "I'm down
the street," and hang up.

52:29.518 --> 52:32.886
And he'd say, "I'll take
a chicken breast, Cheerios."

52:32.922 --> 52:35.221
- <i>And another hour passed.</i>
- (phone rings)

52:35.257 --> 52:37.324
"Hey, where are you?" "I'm almost there.

52:37.359 --> 52:39.092
<i>I'm at the light." By three o'clock,</i>

52:39.127 --> 52:41.528
I realized Jimmy was hostile.

52:41.564 --> 52:45.432
Iovine: <i> She says, "Michael said if you
guys want more money, it's cool."</i>

52:45.468 --> 52:49.202
He goes, "Yeah, I'm on my
way," and he never goes.

52:49.237 --> 52:51.338
Grubman: <i>I don't even
think it was just money.</i>

52:51.373 --> 52:53.005
<i>I think it's a matter of principle.</i>

52:53.040 --> 52:55.007
By taking their money,
he would've lost control.

52:55.042 --> 52:57.343
Iovine: <i>By five o'clock,
Fuchs had to leave.</i>

52:57.378 --> 52:59.512
Who had time for that?

52:59.547 --> 53:02.081

- (phone rings)

53:02.116 --> 53:03.983
<i>What are you doing? I looked foolish."</i>

53:04.018 --> 53:06.786

goes, "Hey, you're the psychic.

53:06.821 --> 53:08.488
<i>How come you didn't know
I wasn't coming?"</i>

53:08.523 --> 53:10.890
- And hangs up. (Laughs)

53:10.925 --> 53:13.826

53:14.762 --> 53:16.729
