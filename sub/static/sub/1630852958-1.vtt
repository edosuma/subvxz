WEBVTT

00:02.089 --> 00:05.309
<i>Interior, galley, we're gonna</i> <i>
start getting sails up.</i>

00:05.353 --> 00:07.398
<i>We'll be heeling in</i> <i>
about eight minutes.</i>

00:07.442 --> 00:09.618
When you go sailing,
you never really know

00:09.661 --> 00:11.576
what the conditions
are gonna be like.

00:11.620 --> 00:15.841
If it were easy,
everybody would be doing it.

00:15.885 --> 00:17.365
She's cranked over, look at her.

00:17.408 --> 00:21.499
- Ooh, we sailing!
- Ooh!

00:21.543 --> 00:23.371
Do it on your booty.

00:26.461 --> 00:27.766
Did you guys enjoy that?

00:27.810 --> 00:28.854
- Yeah, that was...
- Yeah, that was fun.

00:28.898 --> 00:30.378
Do it again, do it again!

00:30.421 --> 00:32.597
I'm looking for a
strong sailing crew.

00:32.641 --> 00:35.383
They need to be able to think
on their feet, can't overreact,

00:35.426 --> 00:36.514
and they need to leap
into action

00:36.558 --> 00:38.081
when the sh-- hits the fan.

00:38.125 --> 00:40.170
Daisy, six espresso martinis.

00:40.214 --> 00:42.303
Three shots of ozu,
but chill it first.

00:44.261 --> 00:45.871
I'm gonna stab him with
this ----ing knife!

00:45.915 --> 00:48.831
Going into this season,
I hope that

00:48.874 --> 00:51.529
I don't fall out with any
of my crewmembers.

00:51.573 --> 00:54.358
I'm going to ----ing punch
that mother----er

00:54.402 --> 00:56.534
in the ----ing knob.

00:56.578 --> 00:58.449
So, I think I've learned
to not hook up with a chick

00:58.493 --> 00:59.798
the first night we go out...

00:59.842 --> 01:01.887
maybe not even the second night.

01:01.931 --> 01:04.107
The third night is debatable.

01:04.151 --> 01:07.719
Careful, careful, careful!

01:07.763 --> 01:09.765
So, this season I wanna just
do a good job,

01:09.808 --> 01:11.419
make a sh---ton of money,

01:11.462 --> 01:13.856
but I do enjoy a little bit
of drama here and there.

01:13.899 --> 01:15.205
It keeps me in tight.

01:17.425 --> 01:18.817
You love it, eh?

01:21.603 --> 01:22.734
Ooh, yeah.

01:22.778 --> 01:24.562
I grew up in
Caracas, Venezuela.

01:24.606 --> 01:27.696
People can feel the passion
of my food when they eat it.

01:27.739 --> 01:28.871
I make people cry before.

01:28.914 --> 01:30.481
Oh, my God, look at that.

01:30.525 --> 01:32.222
I have a gift.

01:32.266 --> 01:36.139
I do definitely
go balls to the wall.

01:36.183 --> 01:37.836
I would consider myself
a Chihuahua...

01:37.880 --> 01:40.578
I'm little, but
I'll bark and I'll bite.

01:40.622 --> 01:42.754
Okay.
Whoa, whoa!

01:42.798 --> 01:43.886
- Uh-oh!
- Whoa.

01:43.929 --> 01:45.801
Okay.

01:45.844 --> 01:48.586
that's a
breath of fresh air.

01:48.630 --> 01:51.154
I have grown up as kind
of one of the boys.

01:51.198 --> 01:52.677
Am I the most awkward
deckhand you've ever...

01:52.721 --> 01:54.418
- Yes.
- Worked with?

01:54.462 --> 01:56.594
I have two older brothers,
so growing up it was kinda

01:56.638 --> 01:58.857
like learn how to fight back
or get farted on.

01:58.901 --> 02:00.250
Do you want some eggs?

02:00.294 --> 02:05.603
You wanna poach her eggs?

02:06.691 --> 02:08.432
Oh ----ing hell.

02:08.476 --> 02:10.782
I came into yachting because
I was told stewardesses

02:10.826 --> 02:12.436
were so good-looking.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.177
Hey!

02:14.221 --> 02:15.787
Woo!

02:15.831 --> 02:17.876
Everyone thinks here's
some young, silly deckhand.

02:19.313 --> 02:20.836
Don't let
the baby face fool you.

02:20.879 --> 02:22.446
I know what I'm ----ing doing.

02:22.490 --> 02:24.231
I think people
underestimate me.

02:24.274 --> 02:25.841
- Good job, Ash.
- Yeah, good job.

02:25.884 --> 02:28.626
I've been told that I look
innocent, but I'm not.

02:28.670 --> 02:29.627
Oh, my God.

02:29.671 --> 02:31.368
I get what I want.

02:31.412 --> 02:33.631
There's a very high
expectation on a superyacht.

02:33.675 --> 02:34.893
We've got a lot on our plate.

02:34.937 --> 02:35.894
It's high stakes.

02:35.938 --> 02:37.853
Whoa... whoa!

02:37.896 --> 02:39.811
Oh sh--, it got my head.

02:39.855 --> 02:41.378
It's taken the top of
his scalp off.

02:41.422 --> 02:42.727
Oh, my God.

02:42.771 --> 02:44.207
They're gonna break.

02:44.251 --> 02:45.513
Ah!

02:45.556 --> 02:46.514
I'm over this, eh?

02:46.557 --> 02:48.211
I'm ----ing over this.

02:48.255 --> 02:50.474
So drunk.

02:50.518 --> 02:51.649
Oh!

02:54.522 --> 02:56.480
Ah!

02:56.524 --> 02:58.830
All crew, all crew, I see
the guests coming now.

03:00.484 --> 03:02.225
Oh, oh, oh!

03:02.269 --> 03:04.488
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

03:04.532 --> 03:05.881
Opa!

03:42.396 --> 03:43.875
Uh-oh, you guys thought
you could get rid of me?

03:43.919 --> 03:47.575
Mm, mm, mm, I'm back
and ready to rumble...

03:47.618 --> 03:48.880
No.

03:53.798 --> 03:55.800
All ready, then?
Ready for a new season?

03:55.844 --> 03:57.280
Ready for a new season.

03:57.324 --> 03:58.716
- Yeah?
- How about you, you ready?

03:58.760 --> 04:00.370
Yeah, I'm excited,
looking forward to it.

04:00.414 --> 04:03.286
I love sailing in Spain,
especially the Balearic Islands.

04:03.330 --> 04:06.289
Menorca is spectacular...
the beaches.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.291
I live here, I have
an apartment here.

04:08.335 --> 04:10.815
But I first came
here in 1984

04:10.859 --> 04:12.556
and I fell in love
with it back then.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.297
I'm looking forward to
being able to sail the boat,

04:14.341 --> 04:15.603
because we never get
to sail Parsifal...

04:15.646 --> 04:17.300
- No.
- When it's just us.

04:17.344 --> 04:20.347
After last season, I offered
Gary a full-time job.

04:20.390 --> 04:21.739
Have a look at this one, Gary.

04:21.783 --> 04:23.437
He knows the boat really well.

04:23.480 --> 04:25.526
I can depend on him,
I can trust him.

04:25.569 --> 04:26.744
Well, he's not my best friend,

04:26.788 --> 04:28.398
but we're good buddies,
you know?

04:28.442 --> 04:31.271
It's kinda odd to see
a CV without a photo.

04:33.577 --> 04:34.883
Yes.

04:34.926 --> 04:36.580
Since last charter season,
Gary just has

04:36.624 --> 04:39.496
a bit more respect for his job,
for Glenn, for myself.

04:42.934 --> 04:44.936
I've worked hard
to be where I am.

04:44.980 --> 04:47.765
It's taken 11 years to become
a chief officer on a 55-meter.

04:47.809 --> 04:49.506
It feels good.

04:49.550 --> 04:50.507
I have a lot to teach,
so I hope you've got a team

04:50.551 --> 04:52.117
that's willing to learn.

04:52.161 --> 04:53.423
What time are the crew arriving,
Glenn, do you know?

04:53.467 --> 04:54.424
I think pretty soon.

04:54.468 --> 04:55.643
Straight into the thick of it.

05:10.919 --> 05:12.007
Glenn!

05:12.050 --> 05:13.791
Hey, how are you?

05:13.835 --> 05:15.010
Good!

05:15.053 --> 05:17.491
Yay, I'm so excited to be back.

05:17.534 --> 05:18.970
Wow, so good
to see you.

05:19.014 --> 05:20.145
You, too.

05:20.189 --> 05:22.104
I'm back to work.

05:22.147 --> 05:25.803
I mean, I'd rather be on the
beach, but a girl's gotta eat.

05:25.847 --> 05:27.544
Yeah, I'm excited to be back.

05:27.588 --> 05:28.676
- How've you been?
- Good, yeah.

05:28.719 --> 05:30.460
What have you been up to?

05:30.504 --> 05:32.157
Yeah, I left here, went back
to my old boat for a bit,

05:32.201 --> 05:34.377
and then I joined a boat,
but we didn't have guests on.

05:34.421 --> 05:37.859
This is the first charter
I've done since last year,

05:37.902 --> 05:39.513
which is kinda scary.

05:39.556 --> 05:41.515
I'm like, do I remember
how to be a stewardess?

05:41.558 --> 05:44.474
I feel better prepared
coming into this season.

05:44.518 --> 05:45.997
My role as a chief stew is,

05:46.041 --> 05:47.651
you know, I'm the kind
of puppet-master.

05:47.695 --> 05:49.000
- Thank you.
- Hey!

05:49.044 --> 05:50.567
- Hello!
- Hello.

05:50.611 --> 05:52.090
- How are you?
- Good, thank you.

05:53.527 --> 05:54.832
You, too.

05:54.876 --> 05:56.181
But if the team looks good,
I look good.

05:56.225 --> 05:57.835
So, I'm really hoping
that the team

05:57.879 --> 06:00.185
will learn real
quick I'm right...

06:00.229 --> 06:01.448
I'm always right.

06:01.491 --> 06:03.406
So, cabin arrangements.

06:03.450 --> 06:04.799
Because there's four
girls on board,

06:04.842 --> 06:06.583
we'll have to take
the three-person cabin.

06:06.627 --> 06:08.411
- Yeah, that's fine.
- Because the chef's a male.

06:08.455 --> 06:09.412
That's fine, take the
three-person, that's fine.

06:09.456 --> 06:10.413
Ugh!

06:10.457 --> 06:12.676
Good thing you travel light.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.809
And I haven't
left the boat, so geez.

06:14.852 --> 06:16.114
- No one else is here.
- No.

06:16.158 --> 06:17.681
I can have a coffee.

06:17.725 --> 06:18.682
Yeah, I'm also gonna
have another coffee.

06:18.726 --> 06:20.554
- Ooh.
- Okay.

06:20.597 --> 06:21.685
Hey, mate, can I give
you a hand there?

06:21.729 --> 06:22.686
- I'm good.
- Yeah?

06:22.730 --> 06:23.948
- Gary.
- Marcos.

06:23.992 --> 06:25.863
- Marcos, nice to meet you.
- Glenn.

06:25.907 --> 06:27.212
Captain, Marcos,
nice to meet you.

06:27.256 --> 06:28.953
Hi, I'm Daisy nice
to meet you.

06:28.997 --> 06:30.781
Marcos, nice to meet you.

06:30.825 --> 06:32.479
- Where are you from?
- Venezuela.

06:32.522 --> 06:33.784
- Venezuela? Okay!
- Yeah.

06:33.828 --> 06:35.873
My background
is Italian-Venezuelan,

06:35.917 --> 06:40.138
so I grew up eating pasta,
but also plantains.

06:40.182 --> 06:42.097
- Where are you from?
- South Africa.

06:42.140 --> 06:44.665
- I'm Irish.
- It's like the UN in here.

06:55.110 --> 06:56.981
Food truck, not even
have air condition.

06:57.025 --> 06:58.809
You're gonna be
in the cabin with...

06:58.853 --> 07:00.942
Me.
Three of us bunking, boy.

07:00.985 --> 07:02.465
Oh sh--.

07:02.509 --> 07:04.902
Your cabin is
the first one on the left.

07:04.946 --> 07:06.904
This can be you,
so you don't wake us up.

07:06.948 --> 07:08.253
Yeah.

07:08.297 --> 07:09.472
We're gonna have
a good season, buddy!

07:09.516 --> 07:10.517
Yeah.

07:14.521 --> 07:16.044
- If you wanna...
- Yeah.

07:16.087 --> 07:17.654
store stuff underneath
the seating,

07:17.698 --> 07:18.829
that's all empty for
you to store stuff.

07:18.873 --> 07:20.091
Okay, great.

07:20.135 --> 07:21.919
Hi, I'm Kelsie.

07:21.963 --> 07:23.747
- Nice to meet you, I'm Daisy.
- Nice to meet you too.

07:23.791 --> 07:24.922
- This is Gary.
- Hello, Gary.

07:24.966 --> 07:26.097
- Hi.
- Kelsie.

07:26.141 --> 07:27.185
Hello, Kelsie,
nice to meet you.

07:27.229 --> 07:28.970
- You're deck?
- Yes.

07:29.013 --> 07:30.101
Okay, cool.

07:30.145 --> 07:31.494
I'll show you your cabin.

07:31.538 --> 07:32.930
- Thanks, Dais.
- Cool.

07:32.974 --> 07:34.105
You can have a choice...
do you wanna share with me?

07:34.149 --> 07:35.150
Yeah.

07:40.198 --> 07:42.549
Oh sh--.

07:42.592 --> 07:43.724
Knock-knock!

07:43.767 --> 07:44.768
Welcome aboard.

07:44.812 --> 07:46.291
Thank you!

07:46.335 --> 07:47.945
- How you doing, I'm Glenn.
- I'm Gabriela.

07:47.989 --> 07:49.599
- Nice to meet you, Gabriela.
- Nice to meet you!

07:49.643 --> 07:52.602
People who love me
would describe me as funny,

07:52.646 --> 07:54.125
loyal, passionate...

07:56.650 --> 07:58.129
- I'm Daisy, nice to meet you.
- Gabriela.

07:58.173 --> 07:59.740
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Hi, I'm Gary.

07:59.783 --> 08:02.612
I like to bust balls.

08:02.656 --> 08:04.048
Kelsie, nice to meet you.

08:04.092 --> 08:05.702
Hi, Glenn, nice to meet
you, welcome aboard.

08:05.746 --> 08:08.052
Hello, Kelsie, nice
to meet you too.

08:08.096 --> 08:11.926
So, this is your cabin.
You can have top or bottom.

08:11.969 --> 08:14.798
Make your bed, unpack your
stuff, get yourself settled.

08:14.842 --> 08:15.843
Wait for the other stewardess

08:15.886 --> 08:17.279
and we'll get started.

08:17.322 --> 08:19.542
The wheels don't work
on your bag.

08:19.586 --> 08:21.239
I know, it's been through a lot.

08:21.283 --> 08:23.154
- Hi!
- Oh, hi, how you doing?

08:23.198 --> 08:24.765
- I'm Ashley, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, Ashley.

08:24.808 --> 08:26.157
- I'm gonna be one of your stews.
- Welcome aboard.

08:26.201 --> 08:27.768
I'm excited to be here!

08:27.811 --> 08:30.640
Look for Daisy,
and she'll get you

08:30.684 --> 08:31.641
sorted with a uniform
and all that.

08:31.685 --> 08:33.556
Okay, great.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.036
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello, Gary.

08:35.079 --> 08:36.559
Hi!

08:36.603 --> 08:37.778
- I'm Daisy.
- I'm Ashley.

08:37.821 --> 08:40.563
Nice to meet you, welcome.

08:40.607 --> 08:41.999
This is Gabriela, Ashley.

08:42.043 --> 08:43.174
Nice to meet you, Ashley.

08:43.218 --> 08:45.699
So, you two are
gonna be roomies.

08:45.742 --> 08:47.352
Awesome.

08:47.396 --> 08:48.353
I hope you don't mind,
I grabbed the bottom bunk.

08:48.397 --> 08:49.703
Oh, no, that's fine.

08:49.746 --> 08:50.965
- Hey.
- Hey, bro, what's up?

08:51.008 --> 08:52.009
- I'm Tom.
- Gary, nice to meet you.

08:52.053 --> 08:53.271
Nice to meet you, brother.

08:53.315 --> 08:54.795
- Hi, Kelsie.
- Hiya, nice to meet you.

08:54.838 --> 08:56.666
This is your uniform.

08:56.710 --> 08:58.102
- How's it going?
- Here's the captain.

08:58.146 --> 08:59.582
- How you doing?
- Tom, nice to meet you.

08:59.626 --> 09:00.583
Nice to meet you, Tom,
welcome aboard.

09:00.627 --> 09:01.802
How you doing?

09:01.845 --> 09:03.064
Where are you arriving
from today?

09:03.107 --> 09:04.674
I've come from
the Lake District.

09:04.718 --> 09:06.023
You probably don't
know where that is.

09:06.067 --> 09:07.068
- I do know the Lake District.
- Oh, you do?

09:07.111 --> 09:08.330
Windermere, that area.

09:08.373 --> 09:09.723
- That's it!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:09.766 --> 09:10.724
Supposed to be really
nice, yeah.

09:10.767 --> 09:12.203
It's beautiful.

09:12.247 --> 09:13.770
I grew up in Windermere in
the north of England,

09:13.814 --> 09:15.598
which is just full of,
like, mountains, fells,

09:15.642 --> 09:16.686
more sheep than people.

09:16.730 --> 09:18.645
I'm a bit of a country boy.

09:18.688 --> 09:20.647
- Whereabouts yourself?
- I got a place in Palma.

09:20.690 --> 09:22.300
So, you're a local.

09:22.344 --> 09:24.085
When you go around,
everyone's like, "'Sup!"

09:24.128 --> 09:26.870
I've worked on motor yachts
for three years now.

09:26.914 --> 09:29.046
This will be
my first sailing yacht.

09:29.090 --> 09:30.874
Without sounding cocky,

09:30.918 --> 09:33.616
the only part that's different
is the sailing bit.

09:33.660 --> 09:34.791
How hard can it be?

09:34.835 --> 09:36.140
You're bunking with the captain.

09:36.184 --> 09:37.838
- Okie-dokie.
- El Capitano.

09:37.881 --> 09:38.882
He's gonna be my best friend.

09:38.926 --> 09:40.275
Yeah.

09:51.068 --> 09:52.853
Beautiful sailboat,
it's beautiful.

09:52.896 --> 09:56.987
This boat? Yeah.
Yeah, it's a nice boat, huh?

09:57.031 --> 10:00.643
Hey, sea doggy-dog!

10:02.689 --> 10:05.256
It feels so good to
be back on Parsifal.

10:05.300 --> 10:08.085
I'm super excited to see Gary,
he's my boy.

10:08.129 --> 10:09.739
Hey, man.

10:09.783 --> 10:11.915
Good to see you again, yeah,
feeling good, you too.

10:11.959 --> 10:14.309
But I'm most excited
to work with Glenn again.

10:14.352 --> 10:16.920
I think he's got
an amazing leadership style.

10:16.964 --> 10:19.662
- Sounds like trouble up here!
- Yes, sir!

10:19.706 --> 10:21.055
How are you, dude?
Good to see you!

10:21.098 --> 10:22.709
- Ah!
- Ah!

10:22.752 --> 10:24.449
If Captain Glenn asks you
to come work for him,

10:24.493 --> 10:26.408
you just say yes, because you
know it's gonna be a good time.

10:26.451 --> 10:28.062
How's it going, brother? Colin.

10:28.105 --> 10:29.280
Hi, Marcos, nice to meet you.

10:29.324 --> 10:30.891
- Marcos?
- Yeah. Nice to meet you, man.

10:30.934 --> 10:32.806
Yo, sea dog,
we have the triple, bro?

10:32.849 --> 10:35.373
- No way.
- Yeah, I know.

10:35.417 --> 10:38.725
Ramekins for a party
of 2,000 people.

10:43.120 --> 10:45.470
- I've got your radios here.
- Cool.

10:45.514 --> 10:48.038
So, second stew and third stew,

10:48.082 --> 10:50.171
I don't know who's
who out of you two.

10:52.216 --> 10:53.348
Hey, Gary?

10:53.391 --> 10:54.392
Do you speak Spanish?

10:54.436 --> 10:55.959
How's your Spanish, good?

10:56.003 --> 10:57.831
This washing machine works, no?

11:01.269 --> 11:02.313
Okay.

11:05.316 --> 11:06.883
Daisy, where are you from?

11:06.927 --> 11:08.102
Dublin.

11:08.145 --> 11:09.712
I've never been to Europe, so...

11:09.756 --> 11:10.931
What?
You've never been to Europe?

11:10.974 --> 11:12.106
No.

11:12.149 --> 11:14.412
That's okay, it's exciting.

11:14.456 --> 11:15.762
- For me...
- Daisy!

11:15.805 --> 11:17.720
Ah! [bleep]!

11:17.764 --> 11:19.156
He scared me too,
and I saw him coming, Jesus.

11:19.200 --> 11:20.723
You sh-- head!

11:20.767 --> 11:22.899
Oh, how you doing?

11:22.943 --> 11:24.858
- Good!
- Good to see you!

11:24.901 --> 11:26.903
All crew, all crew, I'd like
to get everybody together

11:26.947 --> 11:29.427
in the cockpit to have
a quick brief

11:29.471 --> 11:30.428
before we get started
on the season.

11:30.472 --> 11:32.343
Copy that.

11:32.387 --> 11:34.345
- Hello, I'm Marcos.
- Hi, Gabriela.

11:34.389 --> 11:36.173
Nice to meet you, Marcos.

11:36.217 --> 11:38.088
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm Tom, nice to meet you.

11:38.132 --> 11:39.394
I'm Daisy.

11:39.437 --> 11:41.483
Hi, Ashley.
Ashley is a head-turner.

11:43.964 --> 11:44.965
- Cool, yeah.
- Yeah.

11:45.008 --> 11:46.749
Yeah.

11:46.793 --> 11:51.798
Hopefully her personality
is just as nice as her face.

11:55.889 --> 11:57.368
All right, so first of all,

11:57.412 --> 11:59.370
I just wanna say I'm really
excited for this season.

11:59.414 --> 12:03.461
I'm excited to have some
new faces, some familiar faces,

12:03.505 --> 12:06.769
some interesting faces... no.

12:06.813 --> 12:08.771
So, I just wanna
go over some rules.

12:08.815 --> 12:11.513
Obviously, there's no
drinking on charter,

12:11.556 --> 12:13.820
so when there's guests on board,
there's no drinking.

12:13.863 --> 12:16.344
One of the most important things
for me is the communication.

12:16.387 --> 12:18.520
Last season, we had
some communication errors

12:18.563 --> 12:20.914
between the different departments,

12:20.957 --> 12:23.046
and it led to problems that
we didn't really need to have.

12:23.090 --> 12:24.569
I didn't have a
communication problem,

12:24.613 --> 12:26.876
everyone else had a
communication problem...

12:26.920 --> 12:28.573
mainly, they didn't
listen to me.

12:28.617 --> 12:32.186
If you can see something's
not going quite right,

12:32.229 --> 12:34.884
instead of me being chief
bitch, as per usual...

12:34.928 --> 12:36.494
- What's the sauce?
- Hollandaise sauce

12:36.538 --> 12:38.018
He didn't say eggs Benny.

12:38.061 --> 12:39.367
Are you sure he wants?

12:39.410 --> 12:40.934
Normally, poached eggs
comes with this.

12:40.977 --> 12:42.457
Take that back for me.

12:42.500 --> 12:45.068
No one ever ----ing
listens to me, ever.

12:45.112 --> 12:48.463
No one supported me, and
this season, I want respect.

12:48.506 --> 12:50.813
So, I'm gonna be keeping
a close eye,

12:50.857 --> 12:52.336
especially your two departments,
very important.

12:52.380 --> 12:53.903
Yeah.

12:53.947 --> 12:56.471
Ten years of yachting,
this is what I expect.

13:00.083 --> 13:01.215
Coming up...

13:01.258 --> 13:03.913
- Bottom's up!
- Oh, my God!

13:03.957 --> 13:07.264
We haven't even started our
charter season yet, holy sh--.

13:17.884 --> 13:19.624
We got a lot to do today.

13:19.668 --> 13:21.452
If you guys all finish in time,

13:21.496 --> 13:23.411
you guys can spend a
little time

13:23.454 --> 13:25.065
this evening getting
to know each other.

13:25.108 --> 13:26.588
But it is a school night.

13:26.631 --> 13:28.068
Glenn's famous last words.

13:28.111 --> 13:29.852
Yeah, I mean, you know,
I want you to be responsible.

13:29.896 --> 13:32.594
I don't wanna have anyone
drunk on the dock tonight,

13:32.637 --> 13:33.769
that's my point, okay?

13:33.813 --> 13:34.988
- Sweet.
- Thank you.

13:35.031 --> 13:39.557
- Okay, to the wash locker, guys.
- Yay!

13:39.601 --> 13:41.733
All the cleaning products.

13:41.777 --> 13:43.997
Toilet papers,
everything's down here.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.433
We're gonna soap and scrub today,

13:45.476 --> 13:46.782
and then tomorrow's just
a detail.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.088
Got it.

13:48.131 --> 13:49.089
Work your way from the top
to the bottom.

13:49.132 --> 13:50.786
You can make the bed.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.832
I don't know why there's
10 million pillows.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.442
Okay, what's empty?
We can throw those.

13:54.485 --> 13:55.486
Yeah.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.536
You would say you're a sailor
more than a motor chick?

14:01.579 --> 14:03.581
Yeah, well, I've never
worked on a motor boat.

14:03.625 --> 14:06.889
I've only ever worked as,
like, a little skipper.

14:06.933 --> 14:08.412
I went to Yacht Week Croatia

14:08.456 --> 14:10.937
with my cousin as
a guest in 2015.

14:10.980 --> 14:13.548
I was like, ooh, they have
the coolest job ever.

14:13.591 --> 14:15.680
So far this year I was
mostly on, like,

14:15.724 --> 14:19.119
50 to 52-foot monos,
and then 40-foot caps.

14:19.162 --> 14:20.729
I've come full circle,
from being a guest

14:20.772 --> 14:22.644
to now a skipper and
running my own boat.

14:22.687 --> 14:24.776
On average, I have eight guests.

14:24.820 --> 14:27.649
I'm in charge of their safety,
I plan excursions for them

14:27.692 --> 14:29.694
I've never worked on
a superyacht, though.

14:29.738 --> 14:32.349
Parsifal is
exponentially bigger.

14:32.393 --> 14:35.657
It's like a Great Dane
versus a little Chihuahua.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.964
I did the whole full-time
job thing and was like,

14:38.007 --> 14:40.488
eh, I can make more
money hanging out

14:40.531 --> 14:41.750
with my friends in Croatia
on a yacht.

14:46.711 --> 14:47.843
- Do you...
- Ah!

14:47.887 --> 14:50.019
- Oh, me!
- What the [bleep]!

14:50.063 --> 14:52.717
- I gave you a fright.
- Yeah.

14:52.761 --> 14:53.849
Do you have a minute to talk?

14:53.893 --> 14:55.546
Yeah, yeah.

14:55.590 --> 14:56.808
Okay, so when was the last
time you worked on a boat?

14:56.852 --> 14:58.462
2017.

15:00.029 --> 15:01.944
I did it for many years,
and I just...

15:03.554 --> 15:04.555
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:04.599 --> 15:05.905
I'm pretty easygoing.

15:05.948 --> 15:07.776
I don't really...

15:07.819 --> 15:09.909
No, I'm not strict, but if
I'm telling you something,

15:09.952 --> 15:11.823
don't ever take it personal.

15:11.867 --> 15:14.478
It's not my opinion,
it's things I've overheard

15:14.522 --> 15:16.045
or things that
they've told me.

15:16.089 --> 15:18.134
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I don't...

15:18.178 --> 15:22.704
My ego, I leave it
outside always, so.

15:22.747 --> 15:25.011
Being the new guy,
I'm not scared of that.

15:25.054 --> 15:29.145
I cooked for Shakira,
Jennifer Lopez, Beyoncé,

15:29.189 --> 15:32.148
Jay-Z, Alicia Keyes, Beckham...

15:32.192 --> 15:33.671
I know what I'm doing.

15:33.715 --> 15:36.065
I think we'll
have a good season.

15:36.109 --> 15:38.938
All crew, all crew,
provisions are on the dock.

15:38.981 --> 15:40.461
Oh,

15:40.504 --> 15:41.723
Okay, we've gotta
make a train here.

15:41.766 --> 15:43.594
We'll go straight
into the galley.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.858
The meat.

15:48.208 --> 15:50.906
Do you like Colin or Col,
or just Colin?

15:50.950 --> 15:52.473
Whatever you want, mate.

15:54.127 --> 15:55.737
Is my drinks order here now?

15:55.780 --> 15:57.739
Sea dog, are there
drinks in there?

15:57.782 --> 15:59.175
It's a bit early,
don't you think?

15:59.219 --> 16:01.047
No, are there drinks
in the truck?

16:01.090 --> 16:02.483
Yeah.

16:02.526 --> 16:04.485
- That's it?
- Yes, ma'am.

16:04.528 --> 16:06.661
How long have you been yachting?

16:06.704 --> 16:07.967
Almost a year.

16:08.010 --> 16:09.142
How about you?

16:09.185 --> 16:10.839
Today is my
one-year anniversary...

16:10.882 --> 16:12.101
Oh, shoot!

16:12.145 --> 16:13.885
Since I got my first
proper yacht job.

16:13.929 --> 16:16.627
Yeah, on my first boat
I ended up being sole stew...

16:16.671 --> 16:18.499
- Yeah.
- ...on a 142-foot.

16:18.542 --> 16:20.544
That scares me.

16:20.588 --> 16:22.111
I've been sole stew, deck stew.

16:25.854 --> 16:27.638
Yeah.

16:27.682 --> 16:29.249
Hopefully, yeah.

16:29.292 --> 16:31.077
Growing up I always wanted
to be the best at everything.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.948
I got straight A's all
through high school.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.515
College, I worked my ass off.

16:34.558 --> 16:36.952
And now, I wanna be
the one that's in front

16:36.996 --> 16:39.215
of the guests making
drinks, entertaining.

16:39.259 --> 16:41.826
I definitely wanna be
a chief stew someday.

16:41.870 --> 16:43.611
I know I'm ----ing good
at what I do.

16:43.654 --> 16:45.787
- I am out of shape.
- The story of my life.

16:47.528 --> 16:49.182
Are you done with these?

16:49.225 --> 16:50.748
I haven't washed them yet.

16:50.792 --> 16:51.967
Look, you got your little...

16:52.011 --> 16:54.622
I'm not done with that yet.

16:54.665 --> 16:56.276
Wow, you guys think about
sex all the time, like...

16:56.319 --> 16:57.277
I don't.

16:57.320 --> 16:58.974
Yeah, I know you do, I can tell.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.107
Do you have a boyfriend or
a girlfriend?

17:01.150 --> 17:02.586
Single as can be.

17:02.630 --> 17:05.111
Same.

17:05.154 --> 17:06.199
So tell me, what
are your thoughts?

17:12.292 --> 17:13.554
Yeah, I think Tom might
be your age.

17:13.597 --> 17:16.035
I can just tell
by his look.

17:16.078 --> 17:17.993
See, I don't usually
go for guys my age.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.777
Hi, how are you doing?

17:19.821 --> 17:22.084
I think we're all right.

17:22.128 --> 17:23.912
It looks good.

17:23.955 --> 17:26.958
Gary, Marcos, and Daisy, can
you guys meet me in the saloon?

17:27.002 --> 17:28.873
We're gonna have a
preference sheet meeting.

17:28.917 --> 17:30.266
- Copy that.
- Copy.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.926
All right, here we go again,
huh?

17:37.969 --> 17:40.581
- Pass those along.
- Thank you.

17:40.624 --> 17:42.844
Okay, so, first charter
guests of the season.

17:42.887 --> 17:45.673
We've got the primary guest,
McCordia Young.

17:45.716 --> 17:49.024
He's a talented real estate
investor at the top of his game,

17:49.068 --> 17:50.591
and he's gathered his group
of friends,

17:50.634 --> 17:53.159
all hardworking business
owners in real estate,

17:53.202 --> 17:55.248
to celebrate Black entrepreneurship.

17:55.291 --> 17:57.032
- Wow.
- Good for them!

17:57.076 --> 17:59.165
This group are looking
forward to beautiful scenery,

17:59.208 --> 18:02.820
flowing cocktails, and a
five-star dining experience.

18:02.864 --> 18:04.170
They are from Washington, D.C.

18:04.213 --> 18:05.867
I've been there before, so...

18:05.910 --> 18:07.695
They all seem to
like the spice, huh?

18:07.738 --> 18:09.566
Yeah.

18:09.610 --> 18:11.829
Just gone do some Italian,
some Indian, and some American.

18:11.873 --> 18:14.136
On day two they want to
do a nice beach picnic.

18:14.180 --> 18:17.313
And then night two, they want
to celebrate Aliya's birthday

18:17.357 --> 18:19.663
with a hip-hop, we
don't stop pajama party.

18:19.707 --> 18:21.143
They are hoping that
the yacht crew

18:21.187 --> 18:23.232
will dress up
with them as well.

18:23.276 --> 18:26.279
I actually did bring my pajamas. Yay.

18:26.322 --> 18:28.194
This seems like a
good group, you know,

18:28.237 --> 18:29.760
to get us into
the swing of things, right?

18:29.804 --> 18:30.761
Here we go.
Meeting adjourned?

18:30.805 --> 18:32.067
Thank you!

18:32.111 --> 18:34.243
- Yay, season's started!
- Charter season!

18:39.248 --> 18:42.033
This is Daisy calling
from Parsifal III.

18:42.077 --> 18:43.861
We are picking up
charter tomorrow,

18:43.905 --> 18:47.213
and they have requested
a hip-hop theme party.

18:47.256 --> 18:49.084
I've never left a boat
with a bad rep.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.607
- Yet.
- Yet.

18:50.651 --> 18:53.958
We were thinking,
like, big, gold chains,

18:54.002 --> 18:55.264
anything kind of '90s.

18:57.962 --> 19:01.227
- Thank you so much. Bye.
- Bye-bye.

19:01.270 --> 19:02.750
<i>Ashley, Gabriela,</i> <i>
would you mind</i>

19:02.793 --> 19:03.751
<i>meeting me in the crew mess?</i>

19:03.794 --> 19:04.795
<i>Copy.</i>

19:12.020 --> 19:13.761
So, one of you guys
will be on nights

19:13.804 --> 19:15.850
and one of you guys will be
on days for the first trip,

19:15.893 --> 19:17.286
and we'll alternate you.

19:17.330 --> 19:18.766
We're gonna have you
on nights first, Tom,

19:18.809 --> 19:20.289
and then that makes you
on days first.

19:20.333 --> 19:21.856
Cool.

19:21.899 --> 19:24.293
Okay, so you're both
pretty green,

19:24.337 --> 19:28.297
and Gabriela, you have a bit
more bartending experience.

19:28.341 --> 19:31.126
Do you feel comfortable to stay
up with the guests, like...

19:31.170 --> 19:32.301
- Yeah.
- serving drinks and stuff?

19:32.345 --> 19:33.302
- I'm a night owl.
- Perfect, great.

19:33.346 --> 19:35.261
Yeah.

19:35.304 --> 19:37.828
I used to work in night life.
I'm used to it.

19:37.872 --> 19:40.048
But I love when I hear that
you feel comfortable, and yeah,

19:40.091 --> 19:42.137
I saw that you have
bartending experience. So...

19:43.704 --> 19:45.184
Yes!

19:46.968 --> 19:49.144
It's more pressure.
Are you ready for that?

19:49.188 --> 19:51.929
"I'm ----ing 33, dude,
let's more this ----ing up."

19:51.973 --> 19:53.148
No more time to waste.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.280
And you'll be fine.

19:56.760 --> 19:57.892
Coming up...

19:57.935 --> 19:59.763
You're naughty, yeah.

19:59.807 --> 20:01.983
Someone's come out of their
shell after a couple of drinks.

20:02.026 --> 20:04.028
I don't just want to jump
to the first person

20:04.072 --> 20:05.160
that gives me attention.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.901
Don't put me in this situation.

20:06.944 --> 20:08.337
We have friends who
talk together.

20:14.865 --> 20:18.304
Gabriela, you have a
bit more experience.

20:18.347 --> 20:20.306
You're gonna be second stew.

20:20.349 --> 20:22.264
Yes!

20:22.308 --> 20:24.614
You're gonna be on mornings,
you're gonna be on lates.

20:24.658 --> 20:26.616
So, I'll be on middles,

20:26.660 --> 20:29.532
but I want you both to
be able to do everything.

20:29.576 --> 20:32.361
You're second stew,
you need to guide Ashley.

20:34.842 --> 20:38.193
- I think we're good, I'm good.
- Great.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.500
Oh, look at that,
it's magic.

20:40.543 --> 20:42.719
How are we looking,
is that us pretty much done?

20:42.763 --> 20:44.286
Should we have a beer,
what do you reckon?

20:44.330 --> 20:46.375
Let's do it.

20:46.419 --> 20:47.376
- Girls?
- Yeah?

20:47.420 --> 20:48.377
How are you doing?

20:48.421 --> 20:49.465
Good.

20:49.509 --> 20:50.814
She's almost done in there,

20:50.858 --> 20:51.989
and this just needs
to be done, and then...

20:52.033 --> 20:53.469
It's fine, we'll do it tomorrow.

20:53.513 --> 20:54.949
- All right.
- Let's go for a drink.

21:02.304 --> 21:03.262
Boom.

21:05.699 --> 21:06.874
Plastic cups?

21:06.917 --> 21:09.529
What?

21:09.572 --> 21:10.834
I'm sorry, did you
want crystal?

21:10.878 --> 21:11.835
No, no, no,
just glass would be good.

21:11.879 --> 21:13.010
We could have another one, yeah.

21:13.054 --> 21:14.882
Cheers.

21:14.925 --> 21:16.492
- Yeah.
- No, I'm not!

21:16.536 --> 21:17.580
- It's very salty.
- That's very nice.

21:20.670 --> 21:22.324
Colin wants to have
a team meeting.

21:22.368 --> 21:23.325
Yeah, I see that.

21:23.369 --> 21:25.806
You guys are dicks.

21:25.849 --> 21:27.938
So, we're all back.

21:27.982 --> 21:30.332
If we do the same thing, we're
gonna have the same result.

21:30.376 --> 21:33.944
No, let's do the same thing,
exactly how we did, but...

21:33.988 --> 21:35.685
But a little bit better.

21:38.949 --> 21:41.256
You admit that, right?

21:41.300 --> 21:42.518
Where'd everyone go?

21:42.562 --> 21:44.781
The OGs went up to the...

21:44.825 --> 21:45.956
I haven't even
been up there yet.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.523
How's your team going, Dais?

21:47.567 --> 21:48.872
Who's your second stew,
out of interest?

21:48.916 --> 21:49.873
So, Gabriela.

21:49.917 --> 21:51.875
I quite like her, she's...

21:51.919 --> 21:53.399
- She's quite cool.
- Probably because she's my age.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.489
- Oh, really?
- Okay.

21:56.532 --> 21:57.794
Oh, who are you
gonna hook up with?

21:57.838 --> 21:59.883
No one.

21:59.927 --> 22:01.755
You, Dais!
Come here!

22:01.798 --> 22:04.453
- Get the hell away from me!
- Mwah, mwah, mwah!

22:04.497 --> 22:06.716
- Get off of me.
- You loved it.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.065
It's vile.

22:08.109 --> 22:09.502
No, you are gonna hook up.

22:09.545 --> 22:10.590
This is official...

22:10.633 --> 22:11.678
This is heads of department.

22:12.940 --> 22:15.072
Who the
do you think you are?

22:15.116 --> 22:16.291
- I just came for a ciggy.
- I beg your pardon?

22:16.335 --> 22:17.727
Please, please, may, please...

22:17.771 --> 22:19.468
Get the out of here!

22:19.512 --> 22:21.383
I love meeting a new crew,

22:21.427 --> 22:22.732
because I feel like if I
just come in

22:22.776 --> 22:24.386
and act like your friend,

22:24.430 --> 22:25.692
we're gonna be friends
eventually anyway.

22:28.434 --> 22:32.394
- Who?
- Ashley.

22:33.482 --> 22:34.614
- Okay, Connor MacGregor.
- Yeah.

22:34.657 --> 22:35.745
Get off your high ----ing horse.

22:40.054 --> 22:41.882
And I am Peter Pan.

22:41.925 --> 22:42.926
Ashley.

22:42.970 --> 22:43.971
Ashley, Ashley, Ashley.

22:45.842 --> 22:47.540
Don't...

22:47.583 --> 22:49.019
Just kidding, I'll drink it,
like the man that I am.

22:56.853 --> 22:58.725
Should I do this cabin now?

22:58.768 --> 23:00.030
Cheers, guys.
To our new season.

23:01.684 --> 23:02.729
Are you gonna get in the hot tub
this year?

23:02.772 --> 23:03.773
This is my question.

23:03.817 --> 23:05.471
This year? He has a girlfriend.

23:05.514 --> 23:07.777
No, but... yeah, but it's
a different girlfriend.

23:07.821 --> 23:09.953
Guys with girlfriends
are allowed to go in hot tubs.

23:09.997 --> 23:11.607
Whoa!

23:11.651 --> 23:14.436
Oh, you never met my last one.

23:14.480 --> 23:15.959
I was, like,
"Get in the hot tub,"

23:16.003 --> 23:17.961
and he's like,
"Absolutely not."

23:18.005 --> 23:19.659
I'm like, "I'm not gonna have
sex with you in the hot tub."

23:19.702 --> 23:21.748
You wanted to, though,
so that was the problem.

23:21.791 --> 23:23.445
Daisy, you horny bitch.

23:23.489 --> 23:25.012
I would have sex
with anyone, but...

23:25.055 --> 23:27.406
- I'm joking, I'm joking.
- No, she's not.

23:27.449 --> 23:29.669
Ah!

23:29.712 --> 23:31.540
Hello?

23:31.584 --> 23:33.673
What you looking for?

23:33.716 --> 23:36.415
This is lame, but you share
a room with the captain,

23:36.458 --> 23:38.025
so this is way
better than that.

23:38.068 --> 23:39.809
That's, like, a turn-off.

23:39.853 --> 23:40.897
Do you have a boyfriend?

23:40.941 --> 23:43.465
- No.
- Oh.

23:43.509 --> 23:44.510
- Do you want me to be honest?
- Yes.

23:44.553 --> 23:45.554
Tell me, yes.

23:45.598 --> 23:47.164
Go, I'm listening.

23:47.208 --> 23:49.645
If I had to pick, it would
be between the two of you.

23:49.689 --> 23:51.908
- Who's that?
- The two of you.

23:51.952 --> 23:53.693
No, no, no, pick him, please.
He's way better.

23:53.736 --> 23:55.172
No, but he's
blonde-haired, blue-eyed;

23:55.216 --> 23:58.132
that's, like, my
stereotypical, like, go-to.

23:58.175 --> 24:00.830
But how old are you?

24:00.874 --> 24:04.704
So, I'm 23, and I usually
go for, like, 28 to, like, 34.

24:04.747 --> 24:06.401
- We're not battling.
- My age range...

24:06.445 --> 24:07.228
Wait, let me...

24:10.536 --> 24:12.929
- No... no, it's, like...
- He's your boy.

24:16.106 --> 24:17.804
Just because I'm younger
doesn't mean

24:17.847 --> 24:18.848
I don't know what I'm doing.

24:18.892 --> 24:19.675
Come here.

24:23.723 --> 24:26.421
But also, I need to get
on with Gary,

24:26.465 --> 24:29.468
so if he's interested in Ashley,
I need to take a back seat here.

24:31.208 --> 24:34.560
- You're a stewardess, right?
- I'm not making your bed.

24:34.603 --> 24:35.865
I need a stewardess's
expertise

24:35.909 --> 24:37.171
to show me how to
make it properly.

24:37.214 --> 24:38.694
Oh, [bleep], no,
I'm not making your bed.

24:38.738 --> 24:40.043
How do you not know
how to make your bed?

24:40.087 --> 24:41.697
Yeah, I think I know how
to do the pillows.

24:41.741 --> 24:42.742
I'll do the pillows.

24:52.273 --> 24:55.537
I'm basically, like, training
you to do your job...

24:55.581 --> 24:56.756
What's my reward?

24:56.799 --> 24:59.236
I'll give you a massive
high-five.

24:59.280 --> 25:00.586
That's, like, one of
the coolest high-fives,

25:00.629 --> 25:01.891
because it makes
a slapping sound.

25:01.935 --> 25:03.719
There's another pillowcase here.

25:03.763 --> 25:05.460
I can think of
other things that

25:05.504 --> 25:07.941
make slapping sounds
too that are cool.

25:11.988 --> 25:14.251
I'm in a bit of a
predicament here,

25:14.295 --> 25:17.820
because I feel I was the cause
of a lot of drama last season.

25:17.864 --> 25:19.692
Gary and I have a connection.

25:19.735 --> 25:21.563
You should be angry
at him, not me.

25:21.607 --> 25:23.609
I have ----ed up, and
I'm sorry to cause a stir.

25:23.652 --> 25:26.742
But the feelings I have for
Alli is not the same feelings

25:26.786 --> 25:28.527
I have for you, and
I'm so sorry

25:28.570 --> 25:30.485
to put that out
bluntly like that.

25:30.529 --> 25:33.880
Not many people can admit that
they are an idiot, but I can.

25:33.923 --> 25:35.577
I hate being on the top.

25:35.621 --> 25:36.970
Don't worry, I don't mind
being on the top.

25:37.013 --> 25:38.928
I'm not gonna make
the same mistake twice.

25:38.972 --> 25:40.843
You know, I don't
just want to jump

25:40.887 --> 25:42.192
to the first person
that gives me attention.

25:45.065 --> 25:47.502
[bleep], you're naughty, yeah.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.939
Someone's come out of their
shell after a couple of drinks.

25:51.680 --> 25:52.768
Daisy's, like,
"We gotta go to bed."

25:52.812 --> 25:54.770
Oh, I don't care.

25:54.814 --> 25:56.555
We're picking up at,
like, 3:00 p.m.

25:56.598 --> 25:59.122
- I'm like, hell, bottom's up!
- Yeah.

26:01.995 --> 26:03.083
No, I've already poured it.

26:03.126 --> 26:05.041
Tequila and Coca-Cola?

26:05.085 --> 26:06.042
To the Coke or the tequila?

26:06.086 --> 26:07.696
To the tequila.

26:07.740 --> 26:09.002
Oh, dear.

26:11.918 --> 26:13.876
- I need a drink.
- Let's go.

26:13.920 --> 26:16.531
- Oh, my God!
- Hey!

26:18.577 --> 26:19.665
No, Daisy wants one.

26:19.708 --> 26:21.101
Daisy...
Daisy!

26:21.144 --> 26:23.538
What's my name?

26:23.582 --> 26:25.845
Your name is Daisy!

26:27.847 --> 26:28.804
You want me to hold your head?

26:30.937 --> 26:32.242
- Are we going to the bow?
- For now...

26:32.286 --> 26:33.635
Why, what's happening
in the bow?

26:33.679 --> 26:34.984
- For now...
- A little chit-chat.

26:35.028 --> 26:37.639
Okay, cool, I can't wait.

26:37.683 --> 26:38.988
Oh, God.

26:39.032 --> 26:41.600
Tom reminds me of myself
when I was that age...

26:41.643 --> 26:43.950
just super keen to have
a good time,

26:43.993 --> 26:46.300
not really thinking
about the consequences,

26:46.343 --> 26:48.171
and taking things
a little bit too far.

26:48.215 --> 26:50.086
Oh, this is gonna be your
first day, look.

26:50.130 --> 26:51.305
Why am I spilling?

26:51.348 --> 26:52.872
Cleaning this sh--
tomorrow, boy.

26:52.915 --> 26:55.309
We haven't even started
our charter season yet.

26:55.352 --> 26:57.790
Holy sh--.

26:57.833 --> 27:00.967
Glenn, Glenn, Tom.
See you at 8:30.

27:03.273 --> 27:06.059
I know that I said, like,
Tom is, like, blonde-hair,

27:06.102 --> 27:07.669
blue-eyes, like,
that's my type to a T.

27:07.713 --> 27:09.062
There's your boy,
there's your boy.

27:09.105 --> 27:10.324
No, he is my type too, see,
but he's...

27:11.891 --> 27:14.676
I go for, like, 27 to, like...
how old are you?

27:14.720 --> 27:17.026
- Thirty-three and a half.
- Thirty-four, I...

27:18.245 --> 27:22.031
I go for like 27 to 34.

27:22.075 --> 27:23.380
What, are you trying to
tell me you're into me,

27:23.424 --> 27:24.817
is that what
you're getting there?

27:24.860 --> 27:28.647
What? Oh, my God.

27:28.690 --> 27:29.952
I'm gonna head in.

27:29.996 --> 27:32.607
Good night.
See you guys in the morning.

27:41.050 --> 27:42.704
Blegh.

27:42.748 --> 27:43.792
You're pretty cute,
I'm not gonna lie...

27:48.275 --> 27:50.016
He's not your friend,
you met him today.

27:50.059 --> 27:51.408
Blegh.

27:51.452 --> 27:53.062
It doesn't take me long
to make a friend.

27:53.106 --> 27:54.063
- So, if I kiss you...
- Are we not friends?

27:54.107 --> 27:55.717
Are you gonna ----ing...

27:55.761 --> 27:56.892
Yes, so don't put me
in that situation.

27:56.936 --> 27:57.980
...shut me down?

27:58.024 --> 27:59.242
Don't put me in that situation.

27:59.286 --> 28:01.114
We have friends
who talk together.

28:01.157 --> 28:03.420
Oh, my God.

28:03.464 --> 28:05.292
You are the naughtiest
person I ever met...

28:05.335 --> 28:08.904
- ever met in my life
- It's just a kiss.

28:08.948 --> 28:10.123
You're the naughtiest
person I've ever met.

28:20.524 --> 28:22.831
If my friend tells me that
he thinks a girl's cute,

28:22.875 --> 28:24.224
I can't pursue that girl.

28:24.267 --> 28:26.313
We have friends who talk together.

28:26.356 --> 28:27.706
You are the naughtiest
person I ever met...

28:27.749 --> 28:31.100
- ever met in my life
- It's just a kiss.

28:31.144 --> 28:32.623
You are the naughtiest
person I've ever met.

28:37.628 --> 28:41.110
Mm-mmm, mm-mmm, mm-mmm,
no, no, no.

28:41.154 --> 28:43.591
No, you're naughty!
Stop it!

28:43.634 --> 28:46.420
I told you no, Jesus.

28:47.421 --> 28:48.770
No...

28:48.814 --> 28:51.512
He won't know.

28:51.555 --> 28:53.427
Excusez-moi, guys,
I have to go and sleep.

28:53.470 --> 28:55.124
Good night.

28:55.168 --> 28:56.647
- What the [bleep]?
- I'm trying to help you up.

28:56.691 --> 28:58.475
I don't need your help.

29:01.217 --> 29:02.175
Yeah.

29:02.218 --> 29:03.437
Don't wake Glenn up.

29:03.480 --> 29:04.786
- Hup!
- Don't wake Glenn up.

29:04.830 --> 29:06.440
All right, good night, everyone.

29:06.483 --> 29:07.615
All right.

29:07.658 --> 29:09.443
I don't wanna go to bed.

29:14.578 --> 29:15.579
Captain.

29:27.896 --> 29:28.897
Mm, whoopsie.

29:37.950 --> 29:39.168
Say again?

29:40.300 --> 29:41.823
You don't?

29:41.867 --> 29:43.216
What do you mean?

30:00.886 --> 30:03.366
All right, guys,
you've obviously...

30:03.410 --> 30:04.715
you guys have this
place very clean.

30:04.759 --> 30:06.500
Did you guys kill
this tequila or not?

30:06.543 --> 30:07.980
- I have.
- Not your ----ing deckhand!

30:08.023 --> 30:09.851
No, I...

30:09.895 --> 30:12.985
Your ----ing deckhand, Tom,
made that mess, we didn't.

30:13.028 --> 30:15.422
--ing Gabriela
cleaned everything up.

30:15.465 --> 30:17.206
Your deckhand is a sh---show.

30:32.352 --> 30:34.876
You go, girl,
you go, girl, yes!

30:34.920 --> 30:36.922
What are you doing,
SCUBA-diving?

30:36.965 --> 30:39.011
That isn't ----ing-- eww!

30:40.403 --> 30:44.625
Do not ----ing to... eww!

30:44.668 --> 30:45.756
You all right?

30:48.063 --> 30:51.937
Hm?

30:51.980 --> 30:52.981
So, what's your plan?

31:16.439 --> 31:17.614
I'm gonna drink more.

31:20.791 --> 31:24.012
- Whoa, Daisy!
- Whoa, girl!

31:24.056 --> 31:25.405
Daisy.

31:25.448 --> 31:26.885
A little shot.
A little shot.

31:31.759 --> 31:33.326
- That's yours.
- Do it, ----ing...

31:33.369 --> 31:34.414
No, that's got your name
written all over it.

31:34.457 --> 31:35.763
- I swear to God, Daisy.
- Daisy!

31:35.806 --> 31:36.982
We've already shared it,
do it, please.

31:37.025 --> 31:39.462
- Oh, God.
- Do it!

31:39.506 --> 31:40.855
- Don't be a little bitch.
- Yeah.

31:40.899 --> 31:42.596
I'm such a little bitch.

31:45.642 --> 31:46.643
Gary.

31:49.820 --> 31:51.822
- Can we finish our beer?
- No, let's go.

31:51.866 --> 31:54.825
Oh.

31:54.869 --> 31:56.088
We've got a charter tomorrow.

31:56.131 --> 31:58.003
--ing Tom is man down.

31:58.046 --> 31:59.961
- What do you mean?
- Go have a look in the mess.

32:00.005 --> 32:02.616
- You're kidding.
- ----ing hell.

32:02.659 --> 32:03.965
I don't wanna be the buzz kill,

32:04.009 --> 32:05.836
but I need to make
the point of

32:05.880 --> 32:07.969
why you don't do
what you just did.

32:08.013 --> 32:09.753
We're picking up
guests tomorrow.

32:09.797 --> 32:10.929
Get your asses to bed.

32:13.409 --> 32:15.977
Oh!

32:16.021 --> 32:17.805
What the are you doing?

32:17.848 --> 32:18.980
I was trying to do...

32:19.024 --> 32:20.764
I was trying to do
the right thing.

32:24.029 --> 32:25.465
Mate!

32:26.466 --> 32:28.511
Yeah, fair enough.

32:28.555 --> 32:30.470
Oh that's
not a good look.

32:30.513 --> 32:31.732
You okay, buddy?

32:31.775 --> 32:33.821
Can I get you some
water or anything?

32:33.864 --> 32:36.041
Perfect example of what
not to do on a school night.

32:39.870 --> 32:41.742
Let him do his thing.
We're going to bed.

32:46.442 --> 32:47.443
Night, Tom.

33:13.121 --> 33:15.558
I am sh--ting myself right now.

33:15.602 --> 33:17.604
I just wanted to have a
few beers, let loose,

33:17.647 --> 33:19.519
prove to everyone that
I can drink

33:19.562 --> 33:21.651
just as much as everyone else
and have a good time.

33:21.695 --> 33:23.697
This is the worst start
to this boat

33:23.740 --> 33:24.828
that I could have asked for.

33:30.747 --> 33:32.575
Jesus, bro.

33:58.645 --> 33:59.907
It's so embarrassing.

33:59.950 --> 34:00.908
Morning.

34:00.951 --> 34:01.909
How are you today?

34:01.952 --> 34:03.998
Good, good.

34:04.042 --> 34:05.086
Good morning, everybody.

34:05.130 --> 34:06.870
- Morning.
- How's it going?

34:06.914 --> 34:08.220
It's fine, Gary.

34:08.263 --> 34:09.917
Is it fine? Cool.

34:09.960 --> 34:10.961
- What happened last night, guys?
- I feel amazing.

34:11.005 --> 34:12.920
Where is he?

34:12.963 --> 34:14.835
I don't think I've been more
embarrassed in my whole life.

34:14.878 --> 34:16.097
I'm just gonna go downstairs
and pick up where we left off.

34:16.141 --> 34:17.577
- Okay, cool, I...
- Is that okay with you?

34:17.620 --> 34:20.101
Yeah, yeah, of course.

34:20.145 --> 34:21.755
There he is!

34:21.798 --> 34:23.713
No, don't,
I don't wanna talk to anyone.

34:23.757 --> 34:25.541
Mate.

34:25.585 --> 34:26.803
- Morning, girls. How's...
- Good morning, how are you?

34:26.847 --> 34:27.935
Good, thank you,
how are you?

34:27.978 --> 34:29.110
I'm great.

34:29.154 --> 34:30.807
Everyone's fine, it's just me.

34:30.851 --> 34:32.070
- I'm fine, I don't...
- I feel wonderful.

34:32.113 --> 34:33.680
I don't feel hung over at all.

34:33.723 --> 34:34.855
No, I'm okay with that,
just more embarrassing.

34:34.898 --> 34:36.204
So, tell me what happened.

34:36.248 --> 34:37.858
Glenn told me to go
sleep somewhere else.

34:37.901 --> 34:39.077
Oh, he did?
So, you didn't vomit on him?

34:39.120 --> 34:40.643
No, I was...
it was in the bathroom.

34:40.687 --> 34:41.905
Oh, was it?

34:41.949 --> 34:42.906
I was sick in
the bathroom, yeah.

34:42.950 --> 34:44.604
Oh, okay.

34:44.647 --> 34:46.084
Last night, that's a
young person thing to do.

34:46.127 --> 34:47.607
I love it, you talk
like you're, like...

34:47.650 --> 34:48.869
10 years older than
him or something.

34:52.177 --> 34:55.136
- Captain.
- How you feeling?

34:55.180 --> 34:57.095
Fine, I'm a bit embarrassed,
but sorry.

34:57.138 --> 34:59.619
- Yeah, you should be.
- Yeah.

34:59.662 --> 35:01.055
You need to get
in that bathroom.

35:01.099 --> 35:02.578
- Yeah.
- That bathroom's a ----ing mess.

35:02.622 --> 35:04.189
Yes, I will.

35:04.232 --> 35:05.799
I mean, well, to be honest
with you, I don't really...

35:05.842 --> 35:07.235
- No, it's really bad.
- Was it that bad?

35:07.279 --> 35:08.671
Pretty bad.

35:08.715 --> 35:10.238
I wasn't sick on you, was I?

35:10.282 --> 35:11.805
Everyone's saying I was,
like, sick over the bunk...

35:11.848 --> 35:13.111
No, no, no, well...
I hope not.

35:13.154 --> 35:14.503
Oh...
no, no, that's what I said.

35:14.547 --> 35:15.722
I said no, I was
in the bathroom.

35:15.765 --> 35:16.766
But... no, no, you were
in the bathroom.

35:16.810 --> 35:18.159
This is ----ing embarrassing.

35:18.203 --> 35:20.161
I've already made myself
look like an idiot.

35:20.205 --> 35:21.815
All I can do now is try
and move forward,

35:21.858 --> 35:25.035
apologize to him, and let
my work do the talking.

35:25.079 --> 35:26.515
But yeah, you need
to go back in there

35:26.559 --> 35:28.822
- and have a really good tidy.
- Yes.

35:28.865 --> 35:30.171
All right?
Maybe a steam-clean.

35:30.215 --> 35:31.825
He understands the gravity
of the situation.

35:31.868 --> 35:33.566
He ----ed up;
he's got strike one.

35:33.609 --> 35:35.176
Let's see what he can do now.

35:35.220 --> 35:39.746
Because for me, that's
never gonna happen again.

35:39.789 --> 35:42.531
Oh, no.
I'm not good.

35:47.232 --> 35:48.668
Coming up...

35:48.711 --> 35:50.104
- Oh, the sails are going up.
- Yeah.

35:50.148 --> 35:52.672
All right.
Okay, that's main engine off.

35:52.715 --> 35:54.108
This is amazing.

35:56.154 --> 35:57.590
Ah!

36:03.291 --> 36:05.293
Oh, you want them... okay.

36:05.337 --> 36:06.381
So, you're gonna do
the inflatables.

36:06.425 --> 36:07.687
Okay.

36:07.730 --> 36:09.036
And then we can just go
around and polish.

36:14.520 --> 36:17.653
Why don't we go around and
do a quick walkthrough?

36:20.090 --> 36:21.048
I'm happy with everything.

36:21.091 --> 36:22.354
The bed looks great.

36:22.397 --> 36:25.487
With guests arriving,
all the lights on.

36:25.531 --> 36:28.490
You girls are not as green
as I thought you were.

36:31.537 --> 36:35.149
Saw you having deep chats last
name with young whippersnap.

36:35.193 --> 36:38.239
You know, we were just getting
to know each other, and...

36:38.283 --> 36:39.632
Look, if you wanna go there...

36:39.675 --> 36:41.503
No, no, no, I don't
wanna go anywhere, bro.

36:41.547 --> 36:43.157
- I just wanna get my job done.
- Oh, don't you lie to me!

36:43.201 --> 36:45.333
All crew, all crew,
anyone who's not already

36:45.377 --> 36:47.857
in their charter uniform,
please suit up, thank you.

36:47.901 --> 36:49.772
Just having a last walk around.

36:49.816 --> 36:52.514
Okay, scuppers. Sweet.

36:52.558 --> 36:55.169
Yeah, I think the boat's
looking relatively good.

37:01.741 --> 37:03.699
- Whoa!
- Yes.

37:03.743 --> 37:05.701
Never hug me when
you're in your undies.

37:05.745 --> 37:09.183
All crew, the guests will
be here in five minutes.

37:09.227 --> 37:11.838
Let's get everybody up
into the cockpit, please.

37:11.881 --> 37:13.753
Oh, that is so
pretty over there!

37:13.796 --> 37:15.885
I am ready, I am ready!

37:15.929 --> 37:17.539
Let's go.

37:17.583 --> 37:19.280
Okay, Ashley, will you pour
the champagne, please?

37:19.324 --> 37:21.195
Yeah.

37:21.239 --> 37:22.675
Everybody that's not Daisy
and myself, line up right here.

37:22.718 --> 37:25.330
One of you stand at the
front with the face cloths.

37:25.373 --> 37:26.679
Okay.

37:26.722 --> 37:28.681
Ready, Angels?

37:28.724 --> 37:30.160
This is gonna be awesome.

37:30.204 --> 37:32.250
Oh, they seem excited.

37:32.293 --> 37:34.730
My arm is shaking already.

37:34.774 --> 37:36.123
- Hello!
- Hey, guys!

37:36.166 --> 37:38.560
Hi!

37:38.604 --> 37:39.561
Welcome to Menorca.

37:39.605 --> 37:41.215
Thank you!

37:41.259 --> 37:42.347
- I'm Captain Glenn.
- Hi, Captain Glenn!

37:42.390 --> 37:43.739
Nice to meet you.

37:43.783 --> 37:45.567
How are you, I'm Daisy,
nice to meet you.

37:45.611 --> 37:46.742
We're gonna head into the
cockpit to get out of the sun.

37:46.786 --> 37:48.135
Do you guys have
martinis in here?

37:48.178 --> 37:49.354
We sure do.

37:49.397 --> 37:50.572
- Hello.
- Hi!

37:50.616 --> 37:51.747
Thank you.

37:51.791 --> 37:55.316
- Hi, Kelsie.
- Nice to meet you.

37:55.360 --> 37:56.752
- Hello.
- Hi, I'm Ashley.

37:56.796 --> 37:58.276
Nice to meet you.

37:59.755 --> 38:01.366
- We like to eat.
- All right!

38:01.409 --> 38:03.585
- Gabriela.
- Yes!

38:03.629 --> 38:05.326
Welcome.

38:05.370 --> 38:07.546
Okay, guys, I just want
to formally welcome you

38:07.589 --> 38:08.851
to Parsifal III.

38:08.895 --> 38:10.462
We got a great few days
planned for you,

38:10.505 --> 38:11.593
we're gonna have a
lot of fun.

38:11.637 --> 38:13.291
- Awesome.
- All right?

38:13.334 --> 38:14.944
To get started, I'm gonna
pass you over to Daisy,

38:14.988 --> 38:16.598
and she's gonna take you for
a little tour of the boat,

38:16.642 --> 38:18.296
and well get everything settled

38:18.339 --> 38:19.688
so we can get outta here,
all right?

38:19.732 --> 38:21.777
- Welcome aboard!
- Are we gonna do a cheers?

38:21.821 --> 38:25.259
- Yes, cheers!
- Woohoo!

38:25.303 --> 38:28.436
This is the cockpit,
where we do a lot of the meals.

38:28.480 --> 38:29.611
And you've got the aft deck,

38:29.655 --> 38:31.526
which brings you out into
the sea.

38:31.570 --> 38:32.832
Any skinny-dipping allowed?

38:32.875 --> 38:34.355
Oh, yeah, you can do
whatever you want.

38:36.836 --> 38:39.795
Up here we have the sun deck,
the Jacuzzi...

38:39.839 --> 38:41.231
Yes, it's beautiful.

38:41.275 --> 38:42.407
Hello!

38:43.886 --> 38:45.627
I don't know if I can
manage this by myself.

38:45.671 --> 38:47.455
If we go on down here,

38:47.499 --> 38:50.328
you've got the dining room
and the main saloon in here.

38:50.371 --> 38:51.546
This is nice.

38:51.590 --> 38:52.678
I love this, very nice.

38:55.333 --> 38:56.551
We'll go down to the cabins.

38:56.595 --> 38:58.640
Here we have the
two twin cabins,

38:58.684 --> 38:59.989
and they're both identical.

39:00.033 --> 39:01.251
- Okay, they're identical...
- Yeah.

39:01.295 --> 39:02.383
So it doesn't matter.

39:02.427 --> 39:03.428
This is the master cabin.

39:03.471 --> 39:04.777
Okay.

39:04.820 --> 39:06.692
- Oh, who's that gonna be?
- Oh, I am.

39:06.735 --> 39:10.478
- Who's taking the bed?
- Ah!

39:13.351 --> 39:15.309
- We gonna have a good time.
- Yes, we are.

39:15.353 --> 39:17.355
You're gonna go down.
Come back up at, like, 11:00.

39:17.398 --> 39:18.356
No problem.

39:18.399 --> 39:19.792
Yeah, have a good rest, bro.

39:19.835 --> 39:22.011
- Do we have an itinerary?
- Yeah, for sure.

39:22.055 --> 39:24.405
So, I think we're gonna
maybe go for a sail.

39:24.449 --> 39:26.233
At dinner this evening,
a four-course meal.

39:26.276 --> 39:27.321
Yay!

39:27.365 --> 39:28.888
What time were you thinking?

39:28.931 --> 39:29.889
Eight o'clock is good.

39:29.932 --> 39:31.238
Okay, perfect.

39:32.544 --> 39:35.024
So, dinner at 8:00 p.m.

39:35.068 --> 39:36.417
- Okay.
- Does that work?

39:36.461 --> 39:38.419
- Yeah, whatever they want.
- Cool.

39:38.463 --> 39:39.464
Can I take something?

39:39.507 --> 39:40.682
You can take this...

39:40.726 --> 39:42.728
Crostinis with Manchego cheese, chorizo,

39:42.771 --> 39:45.861
cherry tomatoes, microgreens,
balsamic vinegar.

39:45.905 --> 39:49.343
Do you wanna unhook those
from the cleats on here, please?

39:49.387 --> 39:50.736
Free.

39:50.779 --> 39:52.346
This is a crostini
with Manchego cheese,

39:52.390 --> 39:53.956
chorizo, and cherry tomato.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.611
- Thank you so much, thank you.
- You're welcome!

39:56.655 --> 39:57.917
Oh, my God, those are so good!

39:57.960 --> 39:59.005
Is it good?

39:59.048 --> 40:01.660
I am so impressed.

40:07.492 --> 40:10.669
Here we have caramelized
scallops with mango,

40:10.712 --> 40:12.584
yellow chili aioli.

40:12.627 --> 40:13.889
Amazing.

40:13.933 --> 40:15.761
It is pretty and elegant.

40:15.804 --> 40:17.893
This is the kind of
standard I'm used to.

40:17.937 --> 40:20.461
Okay, so I'd imagine
you'll take the bow line

40:20.505 --> 40:22.550
and Kelsie I will be on
the midships and aft deck.

40:22.594 --> 40:24.552
Crostini with
caramelized onions,

40:24.596 --> 40:26.424
rib eye, and chimichurri sauce.

40:26.467 --> 40:28.556
- Yes, baby!
- That's perfect.

40:28.600 --> 40:29.818
Okay, Gary, I'm ready.

40:29.862 --> 40:31.429
You guys can
start dropping lines.

40:31.472 --> 40:32.430
Copy.

40:32.473 --> 40:34.083
- Take off.
- Yeah.

40:34.127 --> 40:35.868
They are loving the canapés,
they're eating everything.

40:35.911 --> 40:37.043
Okay, cool.

40:37.086 --> 40:39.437
- I just have to smile.
- Yeah.

40:43.528 --> 40:46.095
Okay, Glenn, that's all our
last stern, lines are clear.

40:46.139 --> 40:48.707
Bow lines are clear,
bow lines are clear.

40:51.753 --> 40:53.451
Here we are.

40:53.494 --> 40:55.061
I'll do this, do you wanna
start getting fenders?

40:55.104 --> 40:56.323
Okay.

40:58.499 --> 41:02.372
Okay, now, dinner... nonstop.

41:02.416 --> 41:03.939
<i>As soon as you guys</i> <i>
are done with the fenders,</i>

41:03.983 --> 41:05.071
<i>we're gonna start</i> <i>
getting sails up.</i>

41:05.114 --> 41:06.725
Time to clean as fast as I can,

41:06.768 --> 41:09.031
because I know this sh--
is gonna go sideways, so...

41:09.075 --> 41:10.380
- Yep.
- The other one's sexy.

41:10.424 --> 41:11.773
Mm-hmm.

41:11.817 --> 41:12.774
Not the first one,
the other one, behind her.

41:12.818 --> 41:13.993
Uh-huh.

41:14.036 --> 41:15.908
All right, Gary,
you ready to go up?

41:15.951 --> 41:17.779
Yeah. Okay, so what we do is
we just watch the sail

41:17.823 --> 41:20.956
to make sure that it goes up
into the pre-feeder.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.784
Just making sure it's
going in, like, the track?

41:22.828 --> 41:23.785
- In... exactly.
- Okay.

41:23.829 --> 41:25.613
In the pre-feeder.

41:25.657 --> 41:28.660
There are so many moving parts
to a sailboat of this size.

41:28.703 --> 41:31.750
I mean, the sails
are freaking huge.

41:31.793 --> 41:33.882
That white thing,
also known as a donkey.

41:33.926 --> 41:35.449
The little...
with the rope connected?

41:35.493 --> 41:36.668
- Yeah.
- Okay.

41:36.711 --> 41:38.408
So, I'm excited
to learn from Gary.

41:38.452 --> 41:40.585
I've got the adrenaline,
and it's, like,

41:40.628 --> 41:41.629
fake it till you make it.

41:41.673 --> 41:44.589
And you're good.

41:44.632 --> 41:45.851
Okay, main.

41:48.593 --> 41:49.768
Oh, the sails are going up.

41:49.811 --> 41:51.117
Yeah, I think the middle
one is going up.

41:51.160 --> 41:53.641
Yeah.

41:53.685 --> 41:55.164
- All right.
- That's it?

41:55.208 --> 41:56.601
Yeah, actually, that's perfect.

41:56.644 --> 41:58.167
Okay, that's main engine off.

41:58.211 --> 42:00.039
Oh, look, it's tilting.

42:02.781 --> 42:04.522
We sailing now.

42:04.565 --> 42:05.740
This is amazing.

42:05.784 --> 42:08.656
- Oh, yeah, I like this.
- Oh, I like it.

42:08.700 --> 42:10.615
But sh-- gonna start sliding.

42:13.835 --> 42:15.402
Ah!

42:16.882 --> 42:18.579
Oh, she fell!

42:18.623 --> 42:20.059
Leisel.

42:22.452 --> 42:24.629
- This is only the first day.
- Yeah.

42:24.672 --> 42:26.021
Coming up...

42:26.065 --> 42:27.719
- Oh, you're sexy, you know.
- Thank you!

42:27.762 --> 42:29.547
- You sexy.
- Thank you.

42:29.590 --> 42:31.679
There's no sense in
trying to talk a drunk person

42:31.723 --> 42:32.941
out of their ----ery.

42:32.985 --> 42:34.552
Who you gonna tonight?

42:34.595 --> 42:36.162
Nobody.

42:36.205 --> 42:38.120
Let's... come on, we're being
a little inappropriate.

42:38.164 --> 42:39.861
You are so full of sh--.

42:39.905 --> 42:40.906
You have to go to bed.

42:43.996 --> 42:46.520
<i>Kelsie, can you come up here</i> <i>
and keep an eye</i>

42:46.564 --> 42:48.000
<i>on the Jacuzzi</i> <i>
cushions, please?</i>

42:48.043 --> 42:49.044
Copy.

42:53.266 --> 42:54.397
Okay.

42:54.441 --> 42:56.356
I am cushion master!

42:56.399 --> 42:57.400
Should I just put
them somewhere?

42:59.011 --> 43:00.360
Oh, really?

43:02.536 --> 43:05.539
I'm the king of the world!

43:05.583 --> 43:07.019
Do the "Titanic" thing.

43:07.062 --> 43:08.586
That's the king of the world.

43:08.629 --> 43:09.630
Is that what he did?

43:09.674 --> 43:11.414
Well, you ain't really doing it,

43:11.458 --> 43:12.938
because it ain't
no man behind you.

43:15.636 --> 43:16.637
What's going on?

43:16.681 --> 43:17.682
How's your day going?

43:17.725 --> 43:19.640
Yeah, pretty good.

43:19.684 --> 43:21.076
I wish I had a bit more sleep
last night, I'm not gonna lie.

43:21.120 --> 43:22.643
- It's not my fault.
- Yes, it is.

43:22.687 --> 43:24.253
You wanted to talk.

43:24.297 --> 43:27.039
There's something about
Gary that makes me think

43:27.082 --> 43:29.519
he would be, like, great in bed.

43:29.563 --> 43:31.347
You're the boss.

43:31.391 --> 43:32.566
I don't wanna burst your
bubble... yes, that's correct.

43:32.610 --> 43:34.307
That's... call me
Mr. Boss, then.

43:34.350 --> 43:35.525
It's probably gonna, like,
bite me in the ass,

43:35.569 --> 43:38.398
but I know what I'm doing.

43:38.441 --> 43:39.660
I will take these to the bridge.

43:39.704 --> 43:41.140
- Okay, thank you.
- See you later.

43:41.183 --> 43:43.708
So, we have this,
doo, doo, doo.

43:43.751 --> 43:45.448
Deck, deck, if I can
get a couple people up,

43:45.492 --> 43:46.711
we're gonna put these
sails away now.

43:46.754 --> 43:48.321
Aye, aye, copy that, on my way.

43:48.364 --> 43:50.279
What do you wanna
do first, Glenn?

43:50.323 --> 43:51.672
I think I'll do them
both at the same time.

43:51.716 --> 43:54.283
- Okay.
- Here we go.

43:54.327 --> 43:57.069
Hey, I've started
pulling for dinner.

43:57.112 --> 43:59.332
They want elegant,
so I'm thinking black

43:59.375 --> 44:02.074
and sparkly and sh---tons
of candles.

44:02.117 --> 44:03.118
All right.

44:03.162 --> 44:04.206
You can come down more, Glenn.

44:04.250 --> 44:05.512
- A bit more down?
- Yeah.

44:05.555 --> 44:07.079
Looking pretty good.

44:07.122 --> 44:09.124
- Good?
- Yeah.

44:10.343 --> 44:11.649
How are you doing?

44:11.692 --> 44:13.520
Good, she wanted to do,
like, super elegant,

44:13.563 --> 44:15.304
so, like, lots of
candles everywhere.

44:17.176 --> 44:18.481
Colin, let her go.

44:20.570 --> 44:22.398
We're gonna start
opening the transom door.

44:22.442 --> 44:24.096
Cleats, frame, platform.

44:24.139 --> 44:27.273
Now, make sure
the cleats are out.

44:27.316 --> 44:29.623
That's two and a half,
long stay.

44:29.667 --> 44:32.104
Excellent.

44:32.147 --> 44:33.671
We should just go ahead
and get dressed, though.

44:38.676 --> 44:40.503
Alright, listen, now what
we're gonna do is we're gonna

44:40.547 --> 44:42.505
get the NautiBuoys out.

44:47.206 --> 44:49.251
Do you wanna just lift it
up and over the sheet?

44:49.295 --> 44:51.297
- No, it should be fine.
- Okay.

44:54.169 --> 44:56.650
All right, so as soon as you've
done that you can get changed.

44:56.694 --> 44:58.043
Yeah.

44:58.086 --> 44:59.044
And then you can go down
to turn-downs.

44:59.087 --> 45:01.220
- Okay.
- All right.

45:01.263 --> 45:02.656
Oh, that is cute.
Is that Sapore?

45:02.700 --> 45:05.485
No, this is Nock.

45:05.528 --> 45:07.095
- I look okay?
- Yes.

45:07.139 --> 45:09.010
Come on, let's go.

45:09.054 --> 45:10.533
- You're doing both already?
- Yeah, done the back one.

45:10.577 --> 45:12.318
Let's see what
everybody's doing.

45:12.361 --> 45:14.712
Daisy, the guests are starting
to sit down at the table.

45:14.755 --> 45:16.191
Copy.

45:16.235 --> 45:17.715
Let's just get another
drink and chill.

45:17.758 --> 45:19.499
- Ooh, ooh, ooh!
- I'm sorry!

45:19.542 --> 45:21.283
I'll go grab you a towel.

45:21.327 --> 45:22.676
I don't need a towel,
just bring me some more wine.

45:22.720 --> 45:24.373
Okay.

45:29.161 --> 45:32.077
Are you using your
hair as dental floss?

45:32.120 --> 45:34.601
- Oh, my God, that's cute!
- Never.

45:34.644 --> 45:37.735
Kelsie is a bit weird, yeah.

45:37.778 --> 45:42.174
Ah, yeah, weird.

45:42.217 --> 45:43.523
Should we put
the black shirt on?

45:43.566 --> 45:45.133
Yeah, go and change
into your blacks.

45:45.177 --> 45:48.049
- So, for turn-downs...
- Yeah.

45:48.093 --> 45:50.312
Flattening the pillows,
tidying up the room...

45:50.356 --> 45:51.313
- Yeah.
- Make sure it's fresh.

45:51.357 --> 45:52.750
Sounds good.

45:54.142 --> 45:55.491
Oh,

45:55.535 --> 45:57.102
So, what is this?

45:57.145 --> 46:00.192
Oysters with ginger,
cucumber, and mayonnaise.

46:00.235 --> 46:02.368
Tonight's the first night I'm
gonna cook in front of everyone,

46:02.411 --> 46:04.849
so I have to make
a good first impression.

46:04.892 --> 46:06.328
No pressure.

46:06.372 --> 46:07.765
There's a little bit
of pressure.

46:07.808 --> 46:09.767
A tiny bit, but
I'm not gonna show it to them.

46:09.810 --> 46:12.073
But inside, I'm gonna
be like, eh!

46:12.117 --> 46:14.423
This is beautiful,
look at the presentation.

46:14.467 --> 46:18.210
You are having oysters with a
cucumber and ginger mignonette.

46:18.253 --> 46:19.864
Thank you.

46:19.907 --> 46:21.387
That is so good!

46:21.430 --> 46:23.432
The sauce...
ooh, baby.

46:23.476 --> 46:24.825
This looks amazing.

46:24.869 --> 46:26.087
We can go.

46:27.872 --> 46:29.787
We have a burrata salad.

46:29.830 --> 46:32.398
That foam you have on top
is a balsamic air.

46:32.441 --> 46:34.139
- Ooh.
- Which it makes more smooth.

46:34.182 --> 46:35.749
Mm, mm,
that is good.

46:35.793 --> 46:38.665
Everything is good,
this is too much.

46:38.708 --> 46:40.275
- I'm actually full.
- Really?

46:40.319 --> 46:41.494
Let me go.

46:41.537 --> 46:43.452
So, we have beef
tenderloin marinated

46:43.496 --> 46:46.107
with Dijon mustard
and rosemary.

46:46.151 --> 46:47.848
And then I make a
red wine reduction

46:47.892 --> 46:49.850
and a cauliflower gratin.

46:49.894 --> 46:51.417
Ooh!

46:51.460 --> 46:53.245
It's like butter,
it's like butter!

46:53.288 --> 46:56.422
If I'll ever marry, I'll be
in the kitchen with you.

46:56.465 --> 46:57.423
Thank you, Marcos,
this is amazing.

46:57.466 --> 46:59.381
Enjoy, guys.
Thank you.

46:59.425 --> 47:01.601
Ooh, doesn't look
that bad.

47:01.644 --> 47:03.255
I know I'm fat and greedy,

47:03.298 --> 47:04.822
but I could eat some more,
it's so good.

47:04.865 --> 47:05.823
Let me clean up this.

47:05.866 --> 47:07.433
Yeah, please.

47:07.476 --> 47:08.782
I didn't know what to do
with the suitcase,

47:08.826 --> 47:10.349
- there's not a lot of space.
- Yeah.

47:10.392 --> 47:12.307
I like to think that I'm
a good leader,

47:12.351 --> 47:14.527
and being a good chief stew
is kind of like having children.

47:14.570 --> 47:17.312
I feel like I'm raising
my junior stews

47:17.356 --> 47:19.924
to have better
chief stews in place.

47:19.967 --> 47:24.276
So, you can go down and help
in the galley and cleaning,

47:24.319 --> 47:25.625
- and then at 10:00...
- All right, cool.

47:25.668 --> 47:26.756
- You can go to bed.
- Perfect.

47:26.800 --> 47:27.888
I'm about to get drunk.

47:27.932 --> 47:29.237
Do you mind drying
some dishes?

47:32.197 --> 47:33.415
Depends on the crew.

47:35.504 --> 47:36.897
You've got the dream team.

47:36.941 --> 47:38.681
Daisy, I'm still
a little bit hungry.

47:38.725 --> 47:40.466
- Okay.
- Can I have something else?

47:40.509 --> 47:41.684
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

47:41.728 --> 47:42.947
Okay, sure.

47:42.990 --> 47:43.948
- What would...
- So, whatever he has.

47:43.991 --> 47:45.340
Okay.

47:45.384 --> 47:47.908
Thank Lord,
you helped me today.

47:47.952 --> 47:49.562
Chef, I'm really sorry...

47:49.605 --> 47:51.172
One of them's still hungry.

47:51.216 --> 47:52.739
- Okay, what do they want?
- She said anything.

47:52.782 --> 47:54.480
I'm impressed.

47:54.523 --> 47:55.698
So, dessert's still gonna
be another little bit.

47:58.397 --> 48:00.834
You don't need no more, girl!
No!

48:00.878 --> 48:02.270
She's on holiday.

48:06.405 --> 48:07.536
Oo-eee, papi.

48:07.580 --> 48:08.755
Okay, are you gorgeous.

48:08.798 --> 48:09.712
Thank you.

48:13.760 --> 48:15.762
That's some top-quality
right there.

48:15.805 --> 48:17.329
- I have more.
- You're taking it up?

48:17.372 --> 48:18.591
Yeah, I want...
in cases like this, yes.

48:18.634 --> 48:20.201
He definitely knows
what he's doing.

48:20.245 --> 48:21.637
The chef is here!

48:21.681 --> 48:23.335
Yes, Chef, thank you so much!

48:23.378 --> 48:24.989
Oh, my God!

48:25.032 --> 48:27.295
Listen, Chef, do you have
any other food left?

48:27.339 --> 48:28.557
You guys are hungry still?

48:28.601 --> 48:29.994
- Yes.
- Oh, okay, I didn't know.

48:30.037 --> 48:32.300
Give us, like,
the hors d'oeuvres.

48:32.344 --> 48:34.346
- What about the dessert?
- We ain't ready for dessert.

48:34.389 --> 48:36.957
I know my food is good, but

48:37.001 --> 48:39.351
They're still hungry.
I need to make hors d'oeuvres.

48:39.394 --> 48:41.222
- You're joking.
- No, I'm not joking.

48:41.266 --> 48:43.355
They definitely want
their money worth.

48:43.398 --> 48:44.617
Ah.

48:44.660 --> 48:46.358
- I feel twisted.
- No, you are twisted.

48:46.401 --> 48:48.621
- Move over.
- Oh

48:52.581 --> 48:54.322
I need to make more food.

48:54.366 --> 48:55.845
- Really?
- You serious?

48:55.889 --> 48:57.673
Baby, I want some food.
Some more steak or something.

48:57.717 --> 48:59.023
I don't know how the
they're still hungry.

48:59.066 --> 49:00.546
I know tomorrow I put
more food on the plate.

49:00.589 --> 49:01.982
Now we know.

49:03.810 --> 49:06.030
Wait is it the boat,
or is that you?

49:06.073 --> 49:07.683
I can't even tell anymore.

49:07.727 --> 49:09.511
- Can I have some?
- Yeah.

49:09.555 --> 49:10.860
- Yes.
- I'm sorry.

49:10.904 --> 49:12.340
Ah!

49:12.384 --> 49:13.863
Gary.

49:13.907 --> 49:15.517
Oh, here we go,
girl, yeah, yeah, yeah.

49:15.561 --> 49:16.562
Mm!

49:16.605 --> 49:17.824
You see?
Thank you, Marcos!

49:19.043 --> 49:20.827
Incoming food, boo.

49:20.870 --> 49:23.525
Here you go... would you like
me to bring a dessert?

49:23.569 --> 49:24.526
- I feel like I'm--.
- Or do you want to wait?

49:24.570 --> 49:25.527
You can bring it.

49:25.571 --> 49:26.702
- Yeah? Okay.
- Yeah.

49:26.746 --> 49:27.834
All right, let's
----ing go home.

49:31.011 --> 49:32.708
It was a big scramble.

49:32.752 --> 49:33.927
- Thank you, yeah.
- I am impressed.

49:33.971 --> 49:35.711
That was the idea.

49:35.755 --> 49:36.799
Ashley, you be up at 6:00.

49:36.843 --> 49:38.018
Yeah.

49:38.062 --> 49:39.280
Oh, my God, I am
so tired and sleepy.

49:39.324 --> 49:40.586
- Woo!
- Yes!

49:40.629 --> 49:42.370
- Mm.
- This is amazing.

49:42.414 --> 49:43.676
It is.

49:43.719 --> 49:44.982
I'll just jump down, Captain.

49:45.025 --> 49:46.505
No worries.

49:47.506 --> 49:49.377
- Happy?
- Yes!

49:49.421 --> 49:50.422
Yes!

49:50.465 --> 49:51.901
Okie-dokie.

49:51.945 --> 49:53.294
Sorry, that's my fault.

49:54.643 --> 49:55.862
Oh, God.

49:55.905 --> 49:58.343
Look, before you walk,
get it together.

49:58.386 --> 49:59.692
Oh, my gosh!

49:59.735 --> 50:00.693
- Woo!
- Oh, my God!

50:03.826 --> 50:04.958
You all right?

50:05.002 --> 50:06.090
- Come on.
- Are you okay?

50:06.133 --> 50:08.701
Come on.

50:08.744 --> 50:10.964
Okay, let's put these in here.

50:11.008 --> 50:12.618
We gonna go down.

50:12.661 --> 50:13.836
Yeah, we gonna walk
down these steps.

50:13.880 --> 50:14.881
- Yes, we are.
- Hold on to me.

50:14.924 --> 50:15.882
Are you going to bed?

50:15.925 --> 50:17.318
- Yes, we sleepy.
- Yes.

50:17.362 --> 50:18.798
Good night, ladies.

50:18.841 --> 50:20.800
We have a big day tomorrow.

50:20.843 --> 50:22.019
I am gonna go to bed.

50:22.062 --> 50:23.063
Are you gonna be okay?

50:23.107 --> 50:24.673
Yeah, thank you.

50:28.025 --> 50:29.330
Look at this!

50:29.374 --> 50:30.418
How did that happen?

50:30.462 --> 50:32.072
I love it.

50:32.116 --> 50:34.553
I feel like I'm finally working
in a team environment again.

50:34.596 --> 50:35.989
This is ----ing unbelievable.

50:36.033 --> 50:38.774
Gary does some dishes,
Gary does some dishes.

50:38.818 --> 50:39.819
Good job today.

50:39.862 --> 50:40.820
Thank you, you too, eh?

50:40.863 --> 50:41.821
Thank you.

50:41.864 --> 50:42.909
Hey, buon giorno.

50:42.952 --> 50:44.084
Hey, how's it going?

50:44.128 --> 50:45.955
Okay, few things.

50:45.999 --> 50:47.044
Keep a watch, because we've
got rocks just behind us.

50:47.087 --> 50:48.741
- Yeah.
- Do the cockpit...

50:48.784 --> 50:50.003
- Yeah.
- With the K2r.

50:50.047 --> 50:51.048
If you need anything,
then shout.

50:51.091 --> 50:52.745
Cool. Boom.

50:52.788 --> 50:54.486
How are you doing, love?

50:54.529 --> 50:56.140
- I'm good.
- You're good?

50:56.183 --> 50:57.489
Want some more, or you're
getting ready to go to bed?

50:57.532 --> 50:58.751
- I'm going to bed.
- Okay.

50:58.794 --> 51:00.840
Man, my legs are so sore.

51:00.883 --> 51:02.711
You ----ing nailed
it today, mate.

51:02.755 --> 51:04.017
- Yeah, you did nail it today.
- They couldn't get enough.

51:04.061 --> 51:05.366
That's a good
compliment to you, bro.

51:05.410 --> 51:07.151
I love your little...

51:07.194 --> 51:08.413
Oh, my septum ring?

51:08.456 --> 51:09.675
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

51:09.718 --> 51:11.546
- That's cute.
- Thanks.

51:11.590 --> 51:12.591
Yeah.

51:15.507 --> 51:16.464
You are so cute.
I don't like girls.

51:16.508 --> 51:17.900
Thank you.

51:17.944 --> 51:19.119
I thought you were hitting
on me for a moment.

51:19.163 --> 51:20.599
No, no, not really.

51:20.642 --> 51:21.687
I don't know, you sexy.

51:21.730 --> 51:23.471
You like dark dudes?

51:23.515 --> 51:26.735
I like women and men of all
shades, shapes, and sizes.

51:26.779 --> 51:28.389
- For real?
- Yes.

51:29.782 --> 51:31.610
Oh, my God.

51:31.653 --> 51:33.133
- What?
- Oh, you sexy.

51:33.177 --> 51:34.700
- Thank you.
- You're sexy. You're sexy.

51:34.743 --> 51:36.528
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

51:36.571 --> 51:38.138
See, you walk away from me,
but it's all...

51:38.182 --> 51:39.139
- Well, I... I have things.
- It's all good.

51:39.183 --> 51:40.488
It's all good.

51:40.532 --> 51:41.707
I have things I
still have to do,

51:41.750 --> 51:43.578
and I do have to get
to bed myself.

51:43.622 --> 51:45.493
I think there's no sense in
trying to talk a drunk person...

51:47.495 --> 51:48.931
McCordia is the primary,

51:48.975 --> 51:51.847
so it's an exercise
for me to learn

51:51.891 --> 51:54.720
how to politely tell someone
to ----ing respect me.

51:54.763 --> 51:56.461
- Can I have one more drink?
- Are you sure?

51:56.504 --> 51:57.549
Yeah.

51:57.592 --> 51:58.680
Like, you sexy as

51:58.724 --> 52:00.073
Okay, thank you.

52:00.117 --> 52:03.946
So, who... so, who you
gonna tonight?

52:03.990 --> 52:05.731
Nobody.

52:05.774 --> 52:08.429
Let's... come on, we're getting
a little inappropriate.

52:08.473 --> 52:09.778
So...

52:13.782 --> 52:14.740
Nobody.

52:14.783 --> 52:16.002
Don't bullsh-- me.

52:16.045 --> 52:18.744
I am not into anybody
on this boat.

52:18.787 --> 52:21.138
You are so full of sh--.

52:21.181 --> 52:22.704
Bring it on, mother----er.

52:22.748 --> 52:23.966
I swear to God, I will
put your ass to bed.

52:26.795 --> 52:27.753
I do.

52:27.796 --> 52:28.754
Don't bullsh-- me.

52:28.797 --> 52:30.582
I'm not.

52:30.625 --> 52:32.105
Oh, come on.
You have to go to bed.

52:35.021 --> 52:37.154
This season on
"Below Deck Sailing Yacht."

52:37.197 --> 52:40.026
All crew, all crew, let's start
getting ready to get sails up.

52:41.941 --> 52:43.160
Wow, look at this.

52:43.203 --> 52:44.813
Oh, my God.

52:44.857 --> 52:45.945
- Oh, we're actually...
- We're underwater.

52:45.988 --> 52:47.773
Here we ----ing go!

52:47.816 --> 52:49.818
I wanna make sure that
the guest experience

52:49.862 --> 52:51.516
is the best we can give them.

52:51.559 --> 52:54.171
Gary strip-teasing is like
a chicken having a fit.

52:55.563 --> 52:57.609
- Woo-hoo!
- Keep going, keep going.

52:57.652 --> 52:59.045
Oh, my God, Mom!

52:59.088 --> 53:00.786
I hope you didn't ruin my phone.

53:00.829 --> 53:02.614
I do wanna get to know Gary,

53:02.657 --> 53:05.138
but I also kinda just
wanna, like, make out.

53:06.792 --> 53:08.707
Ashley is smoking.

53:08.750 --> 53:10.274
You're so young.
You're so young.

53:10.317 --> 53:12.711
No, you're the same age as me.

53:12.754 --> 53:14.582
No, I'm a year older.

53:14.626 --> 53:18.586
Always, you are forgetting the
----ing lack of basic respect.

53:18.630 --> 53:21.023
You don't somebody
and somebody else.

53:26.681 --> 53:28.509
The most important thing,
especially for tonight,

53:28.553 --> 53:30.511
is just to be vigilant.

53:32.644 --> 53:34.123
The moment you think,
"Should I get them up,"

53:34.167 --> 53:35.255
come and get us up.

53:37.083 --> 53:38.258
I think we're dragging anchor.

53:43.655 --> 53:45.047
We're sat in two
meters of water.

53:45.091 --> 53:46.266
Are we gonna run aground here?

53:46.310 --> 53:48.007
You can lose the boat.

53:48.050 --> 53:49.617
It's about as
serious as it gets.

53:49.661 --> 53:50.662
We dragged anchor.

53:50.705 --> 53:52.229
I think we're stuck.

53:56.929 --> 53:58.583
Here we go, here we go,
here we go!

53:58.626 --> 54:00.324
Oh, make it rain!
