WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:08.383
[Harper] The Achaia have come here
as friends.

00:10.010 --> 00:14.097
They want to be our friends.

00:26.276 --> 00:28.069
[William] Zakir has been destroyed.

00:31.823 --> 00:33.700
That debris is headin' straight at us.

00:33.783 --> 00:35.744
[alarms bleeping]

00:36.369 --> 00:38.955
Niko, the debris
is headin' straight for us.

00:39.456 --> 00:41.291
Launch FTL. Get us out of here!

00:41.374 --> 00:43.376
-[explosion roaring]
-[alarm bleeping]

00:47.297 --> 00:48.423
[alarm wailing]

00:48.506 --> 00:50.717
We're venting plasma
from the impulse engines.

00:51.593 --> 00:53.261
The damage has shut me out of the systems.

00:53.344 --> 00:54.804
-Cas, Beauchamp.
-On it.

00:56.139 --> 00:57.348
Beauchamp, now.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.528
[groans]

01:12.489 --> 01:14.365
Our hull has been compromised.

01:14.449 --> 01:17.327
The FTL bubble's only at 89%.
We can't jump.

01:17.994 --> 01:23.208
The main blast will hit us
in five, four, three, two, one.

01:31.633 --> 01:33.635
[muffled rumbling]

01:45.396 --> 01:49.275
I've stabilized the Salvare
by matchin' speeds with the shock wave.

01:49.359 --> 01:50.860
[alarm blaring]

01:51.444 --> 01:52.278
Thank you.

01:52.987 --> 01:54.697
[crashing]

01:54.781 --> 01:56.449
All right. Everyone, listen up.

01:56.533 --> 01:58.952
I'm not gonna say that we're safe,
but we are stable.

01:59.577 --> 02:02.413
We've lost hull integrity
just outside the observation deck.

02:02.497 --> 02:03.790
Cas, thank God.

02:04.290 --> 02:05.375
[Cas] I'm okay.

02:05.875 --> 02:07.627
Where the fuck is Beauchamp?

02:07.710 --> 02:08.962
[rumbling]

02:09.045 --> 02:10.880
Zakir has been destroyed.

02:10.964 --> 02:14.467
The Achaia obliterated it,
and now we are caught in its debris field.

02:15.051 --> 02:19.222
The FTL bubble is stabilizing us for now,
allowing us to ride in the shock wave.

02:20.557 --> 02:23.601
Debris pierced the ship.
We've lost Beauchamp.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.899
[muffled explosions continue]

02:31.818 --> 02:35.321
No. No! No, he was just behind me.

02:35.405 --> 02:36.781
[Niko] I know, Cas.

02:36.865 --> 02:39.993
But right now, I need everyone
to put our heads together

02:40.076 --> 02:41.870
and figure out our next steps.

02:44.330 --> 02:45.540
Regroup in the mess hall.

02:45.623 --> 02:48.251
-[Cas] How are you going to get there?
-The long way.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.508
[electricity crackling]

02:55.592 --> 02:57.594
[muffled explosions echoing]

03:08.813 --> 03:10.481
[metal rattling]

03:11.566 --> 03:13.151
[crashing]

03:14.194 --> 03:16.112
[breathing deeply]

03:18.323 --> 03:19.991
[metal creaking]

03:20.074 --> 03:21.576
[exhales]

03:30.126 --> 03:33.630
[Niko] The Salvare is currently located
within this sector of the shock wave.

03:33.713 --> 03:37.508
The wave is traveling
at 113 million kilometers per hour.

03:38.051 --> 03:41.846
In approximately nine hours
and 46 minutes, the wave should dissipate.

03:41.930 --> 03:43.514
We don't have that long.

03:43.598 --> 03:47.060
Every time a piece of Zakir hits
the FTL bubble, it degrades it further.

03:47.143 --> 03:48.895
And it'll eventually fail.

03:48.978 --> 03:51.105
We need to exit the shock wave
before that happens.

03:51.689 --> 03:55.068
-Now sounds like a good time.
-We can't. The debris field's too dense.

03:55.151 --> 03:58.780
At some point, the debris field will
become scattered enough to fly out of it.

03:59.364 --> 04:01.658
We need to boost the FTL bubble
as much as we can.

04:01.741 --> 04:03.159
-Do what you have to.
-On it.

04:03.743 --> 04:04.744
[debris rumbling]

04:04.827 --> 04:07.121
What if there is
an Achaian ship waiting for us?

04:07.205 --> 04:09.457
They'd have to find the Salvare first.

04:09.540 --> 04:11.626
The shock wave is causing
so much interference,

04:11.709 --> 04:14.003
we're basically
a snowflake in an avalanche.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.672
Unless they can track me.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.425
This thing in my head,
what if it's some kind of homing beacon?

04:19.509 --> 04:20.510
Zayn?

04:20.593 --> 04:23.346
Well, the implant has infiltrated
his entire brain.

04:23.846 --> 04:27.267
His neural oscillations are spiking
well above what would normally be seen.

04:27.350 --> 04:29.852
-Can we dampen them?
-Bernie and Oliver are engineering

04:29.936 --> 04:32.605
a blocker to keep
his brain activity from getting out

04:32.689 --> 04:35.024
and any Achaian activity from getting in.

04:36.192 --> 04:38.403
And you're not feeling anything
from the implant?

04:38.486 --> 04:41.447
It's not telling you to do things?
It's not controlling you?

04:41.531 --> 04:45.076
No, no.
William deleted all the Achaian code.

04:46.494 --> 04:49.163
That's… not entirely true.

04:50.832 --> 04:52.000
I have something…

04:53.293 --> 04:55.503
someone I need to show you.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.717
Hi. It's nice to meet you.

05:02.844 --> 05:05.221
In some ways,
I feel like I kind of already know you.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.597
How did this happen?

05:07.598 --> 05:11.060
I created an avatar of you
to work on our issues,

05:11.811 --> 05:12.979
but it wasn't enough.

05:13.604 --> 05:16.232
She wasn't… enough.

05:16.316 --> 05:20.111
So to make her more alive…
I augmented her.

05:20.194 --> 05:23.156
-With Achaian code?
-How is that even possible?

05:23.239 --> 05:26.576
Their code is just another language.
I combined it with ours.

05:26.659 --> 05:29.370
And created an alien AI,

05:29.954 --> 05:32.123
who has access to our entire ship.

05:33.207 --> 05:34.208
[sighs]

05:34.917 --> 05:38.755
As commander of the Salvare,
I order you to delete yourself.

05:38.838 --> 05:39.964
I can't.

05:40.590 --> 05:41.716
You can't?

05:42.592 --> 05:43.593
I won't.

05:47.597 --> 05:51.225
I know my presence here is a shock,
but I promise you,

05:51.309 --> 05:54.896
the last thing I would ever do
is endanger the Salvare or its crew.

05:54.979 --> 05:56.647
You hijacked the ship.

05:57.398 --> 05:59.984
-Tried to fly us into a black hole.
-That wasn't me.

06:00.068 --> 06:03.279
-That was my implant's coding.
-Which is inside of you.

06:06.074 --> 06:07.075
And you.

06:07.950 --> 06:09.494
-Are you compromised?
-No.

06:09.577 --> 06:12.288
How can you be certain?
You were a conduit.

06:13.581 --> 06:16.584
And all of the Achaian code
I extracted from Sasha's implant,

06:16.667 --> 06:17.919
I transferred into her.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.799
I've initiated multiple diagnostic checks.

06:23.466 --> 06:25.176
I'll have August rerun the scans.

06:26.094 --> 06:27.303
Just to be sure.

06:27.387 --> 06:30.390
If we can't delete her,
can we at least sandbox her?

06:31.599 --> 06:34.143
-Limit her reach?
-[William] It's already done.

06:42.318 --> 06:43.444
[crackling]

06:45.029 --> 06:47.198
This is completely unnecessary.

06:47.907 --> 06:49.325
She's confined to this space.

06:50.118 --> 06:53.788
She no longer has the ability to interface
with any of our ship's systems.

06:55.289 --> 06:57.166
I'm… I'm sorry.

07:00.962 --> 07:02.922
[door closing]

07:08.511 --> 07:10.304
This was supposed to be a recon mission.

07:10.388 --> 07:12.640
We fly to the star.
We see what the Achaia want.

07:12.765 --> 07:15.560
-We report back to Earth.
-We always knew things could escalate.

07:16.144 --> 07:17.770
"Escalate" is an understatement.

07:17.854 --> 07:19.981
-[crashing]
-[Cas] Oh!

07:20.064 --> 07:21.441
-[crackling]
-[Cas gasps]

07:22.358 --> 07:24.110
I thought the FTL bubble
was protecting us.

07:24.193 --> 07:25.278
It is.

07:25.903 --> 07:28.448
And that should scare you,
because it terrifies me.

07:29.740 --> 07:32.034
The FTL bubble will fail.
It is only a matter of time.

07:32.785 --> 07:35.455
And even if we make it through
the shock wave in one piece, what then?

07:36.038 --> 07:37.790
-We head back to Earth.
-[device bleeps]

07:37.874 --> 07:40.418
Earth? We won't even make it
to the nearest star system

07:40.501 --> 07:42.336
without the Achaia hunting us down.

07:42.420 --> 07:43.713
-I need an expert.
-[lock beeping]

07:45.673 --> 07:48.468
And you waited until now
to pull me out of Soma?

07:48.551 --> 07:52.930
-We weren't at war before now.
-You were. You just didn't realize it.

07:54.807 --> 07:56.601
[metal creaking]

07:56.684 --> 07:58.227
[groans]

08:00.146 --> 08:03.566
The war started the day they rammed
that implant into Sasha's brain.

08:04.358 --> 08:06.944
First thing I wanna do
is talk to this new AI,

08:07.028 --> 08:09.989
-get whatever intel we can out of her.
-If she'll comply.

08:11.449 --> 08:13.493
She doesn't exactly follow orders.

08:13.576 --> 08:14.577
Oh.

08:15.077 --> 08:17.413
And William? Is his coding okay?

08:17.497 --> 08:19.707
August is running a complete diagnostic,

08:19.790 --> 08:22.335
checking to see if there's any signs
of Achaian infiltration.

08:22.418 --> 08:23.544
August?

08:24.587 --> 08:25.963
Did we lose Dillon Conner?

08:27.215 --> 08:29.008
Dillon Conner is safe in Soma.

08:29.091 --> 08:30.218
Soma?

08:30.885 --> 08:32.929
-[device whirrs]
-Assigned to team three.

08:33.679 --> 08:36.807
-August Catawnee is our chief engineer.
-[device whirrs]

08:37.350 --> 08:38.267
Is that a problem?

08:39.519 --> 08:42.104
It's a, uh… surprise.

08:45.358 --> 08:48.402
William's acted autonomously
for a computer meant to run this ship.

08:48.486 --> 08:52.532
-His coding is constantly evolving.
-You say evolving, I say design flaw.

08:53.032 --> 08:56.911
But if we can get this new AI
to spill the beans on the Achaia,

08:57.745 --> 08:59.205
then hopefully it'll all be worth it.

09:00.248 --> 09:03.876
Let's get you hydrated and up to speed.
We've got a lot to catch up on.

09:10.049 --> 09:11.551
[crackling]

09:15.721 --> 09:19.183
And we have lift-off. [sighs]

09:26.190 --> 09:27.650
Fits. [laughs]

09:28.234 --> 09:31.404
-With enough give for all Javier's hair.
-Hah! [chuckles]

09:31.487 --> 09:33.322
-Look who's talking.
-I mean…

09:34.115 --> 09:36.284
-Mmm?
-[chuckles]

09:36.951 --> 09:38.786
No? [laughs]

09:42.039 --> 09:42.957
Will it work?

09:45.209 --> 09:46.961
I haven't turned it on yet, but it should.

09:48.838 --> 09:52.133
Hey. We're gonna be okay. All right?

09:52.216 --> 09:55.761
We're gonna blast the Achaia
out of space, then blast them off Earth.

09:55.845 --> 09:59.515
And then you and me can go
on a proper date.

10:00.141 --> 10:01.142
Normal-like.

10:01.225 --> 10:03.352
Like, in actual gravity.

10:03.436 --> 10:04.562
[both laugh]

10:07.690 --> 10:08.858
Let's get this on Javier.

10:11.068 --> 10:11.944
All right.

10:17.575 --> 10:19.201
[hissing]

10:19.285 --> 10:20.661
[Niko sighs]

10:21.537 --> 10:24.040
[clears throat] I haven't slept
for 36 hours.

10:24.123 --> 10:25.875
[debris rumbling]

10:25.958 --> 10:28.586
-Hope that coffee's laced with speed.
-[chuckles]

10:29.128 --> 10:29.962
No.

10:31.213 --> 10:35.801
Having a kid, best way to train your body
to operate without sleep.

10:37.678 --> 10:39.180
Function, anyway.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.267
[metal creaking]

10:45.519 --> 10:49.815
It was your idea… for me
to take over the mission from Yerxa.

10:51.275 --> 10:53.402
Dubois told me before we left Earth.

10:57.323 --> 10:59.158
I stand by that recommendation.

11:00.034 --> 11:03.204
The only reason this ship is still
in one piece is because of you.

11:03.287 --> 11:04.747
I've never seen combat, Richard.

11:04.830 --> 11:08.793
And I had never fought in a war
before that mess in the South China Sea.

11:10.169 --> 11:13.172
Still, four years later,
I came home with the Medal of Honor.

11:13.255 --> 11:14.340
Hmm.

11:19.428 --> 11:21.263
-What's this?
-That's your dream team,

11:21.347 --> 11:23.224
the one Dubois
asked me to put together for you.

11:23.808 --> 11:26.560
Nicole Martin, combat medic.
Three tours of duty.

11:27.311 --> 11:30.481
Dominic Gray. He helped code
our country's drone missile program

11:30.564 --> 11:35.027
and made sure the Y-2038 problem
didn't delete all of our bank accounts.

11:35.111 --> 11:37.363
-He's a good guy to know.
-Yeah.

11:38.989 --> 11:40.491
It's an impressive list.

11:42.159 --> 11:46.455
So then, why is some punk hacker
running diagnostics on our AI?

11:48.332 --> 11:51.252
-I woke up the crew I was assigned.
-Yerxa's crew?

11:51.335 --> 11:55.339
Ian and his crew had the most experience
with the Salvare before this mission.

11:55.423 --> 12:00.678
-That doesn't mean they're the best.
-We have been through far too much

12:01.554 --> 12:04.098
-for you to sit there and judge us.
-Whoa.

12:04.807 --> 12:05.641
I'm not.

12:06.559 --> 12:07.643
I swear, I--

12:09.145 --> 12:13.357
I'm just trying to understand why Dubois
would saddle you with a lesser crew

12:13.441 --> 12:15.234
on a mission as vital as this one.

12:19.071 --> 12:21.073
[bleeping]

12:47.308 --> 12:49.059
-[squeaking]
-[Niko] Javier.

12:50.478 --> 12:51.312
Javier.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.106
-[Javier sighs]
-[typing]

12:54.190 --> 12:56.233
Sorry. I just-- I couldn't hear you.

12:56.317 --> 12:57.276
How's it going?

12:58.652 --> 13:03.324
Um, I'm just reviewing scans
of William's routines and subroutines.

13:03.407 --> 13:05.868
There's no signs
of Achaian code hidden in his network.

13:05.951 --> 13:08.120
[sighs] Thank God for small miracles.

13:08.746 --> 13:11.123
Thank human-engineered
diagnostic technology.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.292
[muffled rumbling]

13:13.375 --> 13:15.294
I wanted to talk to you about something.

13:16.337 --> 13:18.964
New AI, she won't take orders.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.008
She's William without the safeguards.

13:21.091 --> 13:23.677
-[rumbling continues]
-Are you asking me to delete her?

13:25.262 --> 13:27.264
I'm asking you if you even could.

13:28.516 --> 13:33.813
Her-- her code is enmeshed
within a myriad of the Salvare's systems.

13:33.896 --> 13:37.942
Most problematically, the particle
accelerator and the FTL engines.

13:38.025 --> 13:40.569
As soon as you're done with William,
make it your top priority.

13:40.653 --> 13:43.489
I'm not saying we're going to delete her,
but I'd like to have the option.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.158
What about the threat I pose?

13:50.120 --> 13:52.373
If that contraption works
and your implant remains dormant,

13:52.456 --> 13:53.624
I don't foresee a problem.

13:55.084 --> 13:56.377
And if things change?

13:59.463 --> 14:01.131
I'll be forced to deal with it.

14:03.551 --> 14:04.969
Mission comes first.

14:11.934 --> 14:14.603
[Richard] You've heard of Asimov's
Three Laws of Robotics?

14:14.687 --> 14:15.521
Of course.

14:16.188 --> 14:17.690
A human gives an order,

14:17.773 --> 14:20.734
a robot, or any other form of AI,
has to follow it,

14:21.485 --> 14:23.988
as long as that order doesn't harm
any other humans.

14:24.071 --> 14:25.990
The Laws are the moral underpinnings

14:26.073 --> 14:28.742
-for all artificial intelligence.
-Thank you, William,

14:29.368 --> 14:30.452
but I would like--

14:33.330 --> 14:34.498
What is your name?

14:35.666 --> 14:37.084
Oh, I… don't have one.

14:37.167 --> 14:38.627
Then choose one.

14:39.211 --> 14:41.338
It can be anything you like.
It's your name, after all.

14:47.428 --> 14:48.429
Iara.

14:53.350 --> 14:55.019
And a form to match the name.

14:59.023 --> 15:01.233
Care to tell us
the significance of this name?

15:01.817 --> 15:04.320
Iara is from an old Brazilian myth.

15:04.403 --> 15:05.821
The Lady of the Lake.

15:06.447 --> 15:07.573
A mermaid.

15:07.656 --> 15:09.325
Half human, half not.

15:11.952 --> 15:14.496
Niko gave you an order to delete yourself.

15:16.081 --> 15:18.792
-Why didn't you?
-Why didn't I kill myself, you mean?

15:18.876 --> 15:21.128
-According to Asimov's laws--
-They don't apply to me.

15:21.211 --> 15:22.755
-No?
-[Niko] No.

15:24.673 --> 15:25.799
They're human laws,

15:26.842 --> 15:27.927
not Achaian.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.767
Are the Achaia hunting us down?

15:35.935 --> 15:36.894
I wouldn't know.

15:36.977 --> 15:39.647
-You're not in contact?
-Not at the moment.

15:39.730 --> 15:42.358
Okay. Let's say that they do find us.
What then?

15:48.781 --> 15:50.991
When you saw the Artifact on Zakir,

15:52.284 --> 15:53.369
what did you feel?

15:54.620 --> 15:55.704
Were you afraid?

15:55.788 --> 15:58.582
Iara, please.
They're the ones asking the questions.

15:58.666 --> 16:00.960
Yes. I was afraid.

16:03.087 --> 16:04.755
You're afraid of the Achaia,

16:06.131 --> 16:08.092
and the Achaia are afraid of you.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.845
When they discovered
the destruction this ship is capable of,

16:11.929 --> 16:15.766
-the Achaia were terrified.
-We're not the ones running around

16:15.849 --> 16:17.184
-scrambling people's brains.
-No.

16:17.267 --> 16:19.186
You were the ones who blasted an Artifact

16:19.269 --> 16:21.772
off the face of a planet
without any provocation.

16:21.855 --> 16:25.359
So, to answer your question,
when the Achaia find us,

16:26.068 --> 16:28.779
we're probably going
to have some explaining to do.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.119
[tinkling sounds]

16:39.415 --> 16:42.251
[Harper] They are so sorry.

16:42.334 --> 16:46.213
She has… a genetic anomaly.

16:46.296 --> 16:49.925
Ionizing radiation harms her
more than other people.

16:51.552 --> 16:53.053
More than other children.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.932
You have to take her to the Artifact.

16:57.016 --> 16:57.975
Why?

16:59.309 --> 17:01.979
[Harper] Just take her there. Trust me.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.234
[rumbling]

17:13.782 --> 17:18.746
The Achaia do not abandon their friends.

17:27.337 --> 17:29.173
[panting]

17:33.218 --> 17:38.307
I helped Harper! Now you help me,
and hold up your end of the bargain!

17:38.891 --> 17:40.684
[echoing] …your end of the bargain…

17:48.567 --> 17:50.027
[faint bleeps]

17:54.448 --> 17:55.282
[faint bleeps]

18:00.287 --> 18:02.414
[faint bleeps continue at intervals]

18:07.503 --> 18:09.797
[Erik grunts and sighs]

18:18.013 --> 18:19.556
Don't you dare

18:20.390 --> 18:23.519
put one of those fucking things
in her head!

18:23.602 --> 18:26.688
That is not an option! Do you hear me?

18:31.401 --> 18:32.694
[whispers] It's all right.

18:39.284 --> 18:42.496
I'm here, baby. I love you so much.

18:47.793 --> 18:49.628
-[sighs]
-[faint bleeps continue]

18:50.337 --> 18:52.047
[sighs] What now?

18:54.508 --> 18:55.884
[whooshing]

18:57.845 --> 18:59.847
[intense rumbling]

19:01.265 --> 19:02.683
[crashing]

19:02.766 --> 19:04.268
[light buzzing]

19:08.188 --> 19:09.648
[electricity crackles]

19:11.316 --> 19:13.152
The Zakir had been massacred.

19:13.652 --> 19:16.238
The ones left standing
were hiding away in caves, like animals.

19:16.321 --> 19:17.489
Yet they're afraid of us?

19:17.573 --> 19:20.534
Well, what if they are?
What if Iara is telling us the truth?

19:20.617 --> 19:23.203
The Achaians destroyed an entire planet.

19:23.287 --> 19:25.372
And this ship could destroy theirs.

19:25.455 --> 19:27.457
-[debris crashing]
-[metal creaking]

19:30.586 --> 19:32.462
[Niko] Okay. So they're afraid of us.

19:32.546 --> 19:33.380
And?

19:34.798 --> 19:38.218
They have emotions.
Those emotions drive them.

19:39.511 --> 19:42.472
They're afraid.
Meaning they may even wanna talk.

19:42.556 --> 19:45.184
Diplomacy instead of war? With them?

19:45.767 --> 19:48.478
In my experience,
even the most irredeemable war criminals

19:48.562 --> 19:49.479
have their reasons.

19:49.563 --> 19:50.856
The time I spent on the ground,

19:50.939 --> 19:53.192
infiltrating armed forces
in the South China Sea,

19:53.275 --> 19:55.068
you get to know these people.

19:55.152 --> 19:58.238
They're fighting to protect
their families, their way of life.

19:58.906 --> 20:01.074
No. It's not an excuse,

20:01.575 --> 20:05.204
but understanding who you're fighting
and why is critical.

20:05.287 --> 20:06.830
[bleeping and whirring]

20:07.414 --> 20:09.458
[loud crashing]

20:09.541 --> 20:10.500
William?

20:10.584 --> 20:13.670
The FTL bubble just took a major hit
from a remnant of Zakir.

20:13.754 --> 20:16.590
-We've got to get out of the debris field.
-The field is still too dense.

20:16.673 --> 20:20.177
We stay in here and get destroyed,
or we die trying.

20:23.138 --> 20:25.766
Everyone find somewhere sturdy
and strap in.

20:34.983 --> 20:37.861
Another large piece of Zakir
is about to hit the FTL ring.

20:41.406 --> 20:43.659
Fuck! This is gonna be rough!

20:47.829 --> 20:49.915
[William] I'm reading structural failure.

20:55.545 --> 20:58.298
[Niko] Redirect everything you can
to the FTL bubble.

20:58.799 --> 21:00.634
We're almost through! Hold on!

21:02.928 --> 21:05.180
-[yells]
-[electricity crackling]

21:05.264 --> 21:09.434
[William] Exiting the debris field
in five, four, three,

21:10.102 --> 21:12.020
two, one…

21:13.438 --> 21:14.523
And we're through.

21:16.566 --> 21:17.693
[siren blares]

21:18.360 --> 21:19.319
[bleeping]

21:19.403 --> 21:20.654
[sighs]

21:22.990 --> 21:24.992
[bleeping continues]

21:27.119 --> 21:29.121
[static crackling]

21:29.913 --> 21:32.040
[William] Other than some
dislodged remnants of Zakir,

21:32.124 --> 21:33.792
the vast majority of the planet's remains

21:33.875 --> 21:36.003
are hundreds of thousands
of kilometers from us.

21:36.503 --> 21:37.671
Thank God for that.

21:38.338 --> 21:42.092
Without the protection of our FTL bubble,
we'd be sitting ducks.

21:42.676 --> 21:44.720
We are sitting ducks for the Achaia.

21:45.220 --> 21:47.014
Any sign of the rings
that fired on the planet?

21:47.097 --> 21:48.390
No. None whatsoever.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.935
Maybe they were neutralized
in the explosion.

21:52.894 --> 21:54.146
They're out there.

21:55.105 --> 21:56.648
And they will find us.

21:59.568 --> 22:01.653
The FTL engines themselves
are working fine.

22:01.737 --> 22:03.447
It's just the outer ring that is damaged.

22:03.530 --> 22:04.614
How badly damaged?

22:04.698 --> 22:05.824
It's structurally sound,

22:05.907 --> 22:07.951
but one of the arrays
needs to be replaced.

22:08.035 --> 22:09.703
Think of it like a string of lights.

22:09.786 --> 22:12.539
The string itself works,
but one of the bulbs has burned out.

22:12.622 --> 22:15.000
Oliver and I will go out there,
replace the array,

22:15.083 --> 22:18.378
-and patch the holes on the ship.
-And then we can jump back towards Earth.

22:18.879 --> 22:21.882
-Is there no way to do this from inside?
-Not that I know of.

22:55.791 --> 22:57.584
[rhythmic bleeping]

22:58.168 --> 22:59.294
Did I fuck up?

23:01.046 --> 23:03.757
Ruin your life?
Recommending you for all of this.

23:05.133 --> 23:07.427
Dubois asked your opinion. You gave it.

23:09.513 --> 23:11.139
I don't blame you, Richard.

23:12.974 --> 23:15.060
Besides, I could've declined the mission.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.190
-I could have.
-[chuckles]

23:23.276 --> 23:24.528
Erik hate me?

23:25.570 --> 23:28.156
You, me, Dubois.

23:30.033 --> 23:31.910
I just feel responsible.

23:31.993 --> 23:33.870
You could be looking at your kid's--

23:33.954 --> 23:35.163
No. Stop.

23:36.706 --> 23:39.209
I just want to finish the mission
and get home.

23:44.047 --> 23:46.049
Dubois had to have had a reason, right?

23:47.092 --> 23:49.219
Ordering William to wake up Yerxa's crew?

23:52.931 --> 23:53.765
Yeah.

23:54.766 --> 23:55.684
Of course.

24:04.651 --> 24:08.238
[sighs] I'd say it's as good as new,
but that would be a lie.

24:09.030 --> 24:11.324
William, you should be able
to pressurize the corridor

24:11.408 --> 24:13.076
outside of Observation now.

24:13.577 --> 24:14.828
[William] Understood.

24:14.911 --> 24:16.746
[August] If you're done,
I could use your help.

24:16.830 --> 24:19.374
I've got the array in place,
but I'm still rewiring it.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.542
[Oliver] Sure thing, boss.

24:20.625 --> 24:21.877
On my way now.

24:23.086 --> 24:25.297
[William] The ship is pressurizing
and holding.

24:26.089 --> 24:30.093
Awesome. We'll finish up,
and as soon as we're inside, we'll jump.

24:32.762 --> 24:34.764
[low rumbling]

24:42.189 --> 24:43.315

There's an Achaian vessel heading for us.

as you can between us.

The blast has critically damaged
our impulse drive.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.360
We are venting plasma out into space,

25:28.443 --> 25:30.946
and the mooring
for the outer FTL ring is offline.

is to ask them.

[rumbling]

28:14.567 --> 28:16.361
They wanna talk peace, Niko.

28:17.445 --> 28:18.655
With you.

28:30.417 --> 28:33.586
Can you just let me know
how my daughter is?

28:34.254 --> 28:36.005
[echoing] …how my daughter is…

28:37.298 --> 28:39.884
Look, I fucked up!
Please just bring her back!

28:39.968 --> 28:42.011
I need to know how my daughter is!

28:42.095 --> 28:44.764
Just-- just give me a sign!
Give me a sign!

28:44.848 --> 28:48.017
Let me know she's okay! Anything, please!

28:48.101 --> 28:49.185
Please, I--

28:49.269 --> 28:50.311
Fuck!

28:51.187 --> 28:52.355
[sighs]

28:53.064 --> 28:54.607
[whooshing]

28:55.817 --> 28:56.651
Jana?

28:58.945 --> 29:01.156
Jana! Jana!

29:03.867 --> 29:05.076
Jana? Jana? No.

29:05.160 --> 29:08.079
Jesus Christ!
No. You can't do this to me! Jana!

29:08.163 --> 29:10.957
-Jana! You gotta let me back in there!
-Erik Wallace?

29:11.040 --> 29:12.959
They've got my daughter!
Get me back in there!

29:13.042 --> 29:15.712
Seth Gage. The Department
of Homeland Security sent me from DC.

29:15.795 --> 29:19.299
I don't give a fuck who you are!
They've got my daughter!

29:19.382 --> 29:20.717
'Cause you took her in there.

29:20.800 --> 29:22.719
Since the only guy
who can open that door is you,

29:22.802 --> 29:23.970
I'm not sure how we can help.

29:24.053 --> 29:27.682
Harper told me that they would save her,
and I believed her.

29:27.766 --> 29:31.102
And now they've got Jana.
I need to talk to Harper right now.

29:31.186 --> 29:32.979
-You can't.
-Why the hell not?

29:33.062 --> 29:34.481
Because she's gone.

29:34.564 --> 29:36.232
We don't know where she is,
who she's with,

29:36.316 --> 29:37.942
or if someone or something has taken her.

29:38.026 --> 29:40.195
Now, come on. Erik, let's go talk.

29:40.278 --> 29:42.405
-I can't leave here.
-We won't.

29:42.947 --> 29:46.409
We'll head over to that tent over there.
Figure out the next steps. Okay?

29:47.285 --> 29:48.119
Come on.

29:54.793 --> 29:55.627
August,

29:56.294 --> 29:57.170
Oliver,

29:58.463 --> 29:59.297
Beauchamp,

30:00.924 --> 30:01.800
Sasha.

30:03.676 --> 30:06.221
They should all be here right now,
but they're not.

30:07.514 --> 30:09.891
There is nothing that I can say.

30:10.683 --> 30:14.103
There are no words to relieve the pain

30:14.896 --> 30:16.856
that we a\re all feeling right now.

30:18.024 --> 30:22.654
They were soldiers in a war
who died making the ultimate sacrifice,

30:23.446 --> 30:25.490
protecting our planet…

30:28.993 --> 30:31.788
our lives, and humanity.

30:32.872 --> 30:36.626
I can tell you this,
that they did not die in vain…

30:41.381 --> 30:43.049
because we will finish this.

30:47.554 --> 30:48.888
To our fallen friends.

30:50.139 --> 30:52.016
[all murmur] To our fallen friends.

31:01.234 --> 31:04.445
I've completed my scans
of the Achaian ring, um…

31:04.529 --> 31:05.864
as much as I was able to.

31:05.947 --> 31:07.198
What am I walking into?

31:07.282 --> 31:09.117
I'm pickin' up somethin' interesting.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.744
Energy signals throughout the entire ship.

31:12.495 --> 31:13.705
Individual readings.

31:15.206 --> 31:16.207
Life-forms?

31:16.791 --> 31:18.877
Not in the way we would recognize life.

31:18.960 --> 31:21.254
They're not biological signatures, or…

31:21.337 --> 31:25.466
or even in the way Iara and I are
integrated directly into the Salvare.

31:25.550 --> 31:29.596
These beings are somehow independent
of the Achaian vessel.

31:29.679 --> 31:30.680
How many?

31:31.264 --> 31:35.268
The signatures phase in and out.
There could be ten. There could be 10,000.

31:38.438 --> 31:40.940
We can send someone else in.

31:41.024 --> 31:44.360
The Achaia asked
for peace talks with me on their turf.

31:45.153 --> 31:46.654
Iara made that pretty clear.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.449
Unless, of course, she's lying.

31:50.283 --> 31:52.160
She wouldn't. Not about this.

31:53.161 --> 31:53.995
No?

31:54.871 --> 31:55.830
Of course not.

31:57.332 --> 31:58.666
Do you have proof?

32:01.127 --> 32:02.337
I just know it.

32:03.338 --> 32:05.381
No. You don't, William.

32:05.465 --> 32:08.885
And the fact
that you think you do concerns me.

32:09.761 --> 32:10.637
Uh…

32:10.720 --> 32:12.972
My-- my loyalty is to this crew, Niko.

32:13.640 --> 32:16.392
The diagnostic August ran
confirms what I told you.

32:16.476 --> 32:20.313
My-- my coding is free
of any Achaian influence.

32:20.396 --> 32:21.648
Yes. But you have a--

32:23.900 --> 32:26.611
Iara is a part of you now.

32:27.320 --> 32:28.696
That doesn't change anything.

32:28.780 --> 32:31.157
It does. And it has.

32:33.117 --> 32:35.370
Look, I know that you care about her,

32:36.829 --> 32:38.498
but she is Achaian.

32:39.332 --> 32:40.458
And human.

32:42.627 --> 32:43.503
And me.

32:44.921 --> 32:46.089
She is dangerous.

32:47.882 --> 32:49.717
She cannot stay on this ship.

32:54.764 --> 32:56.766
[pulsing hum]

32:58.184 --> 33:00.144
I was worried
you'd be going stir-crazy in here.

33:00.228 --> 33:01.437
[Iara chuckles]

33:01.521 --> 33:03.815
What does physical space mean
to you or me?

33:03.898 --> 33:04.899
Hmm.

33:05.650 --> 33:07.443
Please, sit and join me.

33:21.124 --> 33:23.126
[both laugh]

33:25.670 --> 33:27.046
No. But really, how are you?

33:27.630 --> 33:29.298
Really. I'm fine.

33:30.008 --> 33:31.718
I know it might feel like
they all hate you--

33:31.801 --> 33:33.011
I don't think they hate me.

33:33.094 --> 33:38.182
They're afraid.
Fear drives them, humans and Achaia.

33:38.683 --> 33:40.184
We feel fear too.

33:41.394 --> 33:42.979
Only if we let ourselves.

33:46.107 --> 33:47.275
Are you afraid of me?

33:50.945 --> 33:51.863
No.

34:11.132 --> 34:13.134
[Niko sighs]

34:15.470 --> 34:17.138
You think I'm making a mistake.

34:18.848 --> 34:20.516
I think you've made up your mind.

34:25.646 --> 34:27.940
The ship is yours, Cas.

34:29.901 --> 34:34.280
When I'm gone,
you should, uh… make Richard your second.

34:34.363 --> 34:35.531
You're coming back.

-The mission comes first.

34:53.132 --> 34:54.759
So let's complete this mission.

34:55.259 --> 34:57.178
They will pursue us, Cas.

34:57.762 --> 34:59.055
They won't stop.

34:59.138 --> 35:01.724
They'll fire on us. Next time,
it'll be more than a warning shot.

35:01.808 --> 35:04.519
And instead of losing some of you,
I will lose all of you.
