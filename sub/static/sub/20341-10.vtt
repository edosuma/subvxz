01:02.875 --> 01:04.625
Can you hear me,
Sea Pup Rolly?

01:04.625 --> 01:06.458
Loud and clear,
Sea Pup Bingo!

01:06.458 --> 01:08.333
Ahoy!

01:08.333 --> 01:09.875
-Hey!
-A strange wiggly
sea creature!

01:09.875 --> 01:11.208
(laughing)

01:11.208 --> 01:13.708
That strange wiggly
sea creature's named Ahoy?

01:13.708 --> 01:14.875
No, Rolly.

01:14.875 --> 01:17.416
"Ahoy" is the sea pup
way of saying "Hey!"

01:17.416 --> 01:19.125
Oh. Then let's go say ahoy

01:19.125 --> 01:20.958
to that strange
wiggly sea creature!

01:22.166 --> 01:24.958
-(laughing)
-(barking)

01:24.958 --> 01:28.000
I knew you guys would love
the doggie scuba gear I made

01:28.000 --> 01:30.875
because you two love
splashing in the water.

01:30.875 --> 01:32.333
(Bob laughs)

01:32.333 --> 01:35.000
And you love splashing me!
(laughs)

01:35.000 --> 01:36.833
And me.

01:36.833 --> 01:37.958
Delivery woman:
Hi, pups!

01:37.958 --> 01:39.000
There you are, Bob!

01:39.000 --> 01:40.458
I have a box for you.

01:40.458 --> 01:42.625
Oh! I've been
waiting for this.

01:42.625 --> 01:44.125
I'm so excite--

01:44.125 --> 01:46.125
Wait, only one box?

01:46.125 --> 01:47.708
Well, I had ordered two.

01:47.708 --> 01:49.416
Let me see
if I can-- Uh-oh.

01:49.416 --> 01:51.291
It says it got lost at sea.

01:51.291 --> 01:52.708
Lost at sea?

01:54.458 --> 01:55.375
According to this,

01:55.375 --> 01:57.458
your second box
fell off the boat

01:57.458 --> 01:59.458
somewhere near
the Great Barrier Reef.

01:59.458 --> 02:02.458
It's pretty rare that
we find boxes lost at sea.

02:02.458 --> 02:03.833
But if it is found,

02:03.833 --> 02:06.833
I'll make sure to get it
to you as fast as I can.

02:06.833 --> 02:09.000
See you later, Bob.
Bye, pups.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.583
This box is useless
without the second box.

02:12.583 --> 02:15.458
(sighs)
I really hope they find it.

02:15.458 --> 02:19.291
Well, I need
to get to work anyway.

02:19.291 --> 02:21.416
Have fun being
scuba doggies.

02:21.416 --> 02:23.750
See ya later, pups!

02:23.750 --> 02:26.458
Bob is really sad
about that lost box.

02:26.458 --> 02:28.333
I wish we could
find it for him.

02:28.333 --> 02:29.750
Then he'd be happy again.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.875
But, Bingo,
the delivery woman said

02:31.875 --> 02:33.458
it fell off the boat
and into the sea.

02:33.458 --> 02:36.125
Yes, but with our special
scuba-doggin' gear,

02:36.125 --> 02:37.708
we can search the sea
and find it!

02:37.708 --> 02:40.208
Underwater puppy power
to the rescue!

02:41.875 --> 02:43.833
Um, how will we know
what it looks like?

02:43.833 --> 02:45.416
Maybe it will look
like this one.

02:45.416 --> 02:47.583
Bob did say
they went together.

02:47.583 --> 02:49.375
So we just need
to find another box

02:49.375 --> 02:50.833
with a blue paw print
inside a bubble

02:50.833 --> 02:52.333
and bring it back to Bob!

02:52.333 --> 02:53.833
It sounds like
we have our mission!

02:53.833 --> 02:55.500
Yeah, let's go!

02:55.500 --> 02:56.625
(grunts)

02:56.625 --> 02:58.833
Except, we don't know
where we're going, do we?

02:58.833 --> 03:01.458
The delivery woman said
the box fell off the boat

03:01.458 --> 03:03.458
near the Great Barrier Reef.

03:03.458 --> 03:04.708
Wherever that is.

03:04.708 --> 03:06.291
Let's go ask ARF.

03:08.750 --> 03:11.583
The Great Barrier Reef
is a special place

03:11.583 --> 03:13.458
made up of
colorful coral reefs

03:13.458 --> 03:15.708
where thousands
of sea creatures live.

03:15.708 --> 03:17.958
Ahoy. That's a lot
of sea creatures.

03:17.958 --> 03:20.291
There are also
beautiful green islands

03:20.291 --> 03:22.708
that boats sail past every day.

03:22.708 --> 03:25.416
So the missing box for Bob
could be in a coral reef,

03:25.416 --> 03:26.958
or under the ocean,

03:26.958 --> 03:28.500
or could have floated
to an island.

03:28.500 --> 03:31.000
Yikes. That's a lot
of places to search.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.416
We better get started!

03:33.500 --> 03:35.166
(grunts)
Really?

03:35.166 --> 03:37.833
Wait, how do we know
where the Great Barrier Reef is?

03:37.833 --> 03:39.625
We need a boat...

03:39.625 --> 03:41.458
which we can find
at the harbor.

03:41.458 --> 03:43.416

It looks like the ocean
is having a party down there!

04:27.750 --> 04:29.000
Ahoy!

04:29.000 --> 04:30.958
Colorful coral reefs
are one of the places

04:30.958 --> 04:32.166
Bob's box might be!

04:32.166 --> 04:33.750
Then we better go look.

04:33.750 --> 04:35.500
-On your bark...
-Get set.

04:35.500 --> 04:36.875
Both:
Go!

04:38.458 --> 04:39.708
Hmm, Frank?

04:39.708 --> 04:42.000
What kind of fishies
are those?

04:42.000 --> 04:43.458
Hmm.

04:43.458 --> 04:45.583
Those must be
dogfish fishies.

04:45.583 --> 04:47.583
Bingo:
Now remember, Sea Pup Rolly,

04:47.583 --> 04:48.833
we're looking for a box

04:48.833 --> 04:50.500
with a paw print
inside a bubble.

04:50.500 --> 04:52.416
One bubble box for Bob.

04:52.416 --> 04:53.458
Got it.

04:53.458 --> 04:55.291
Paw print inside a bubble.

04:55.291 --> 04:57.250
Paw print inside a bubble.

04:57.250 --> 04:59.250
Ahoy! I see a bubble.

04:59.250 --> 05:00.583
Is there a paw print
inside it?

05:00.583 --> 05:02.833
No, because the bubble's
coming from a fish!

05:02.833 --> 05:04.500
Ahoy, there, Mr. Fish!

05:04.500 --> 05:05.500
Have you seen--

05:06.625 --> 05:08.208
Come back,
I didn't get to ask

05:08.208 --> 05:09.750
if you've seen
Bob's lost box!

05:09.750 --> 05:11.250
Rolly, wait!

05:13.583 --> 05:15.583
Wow! This little fish is fast.

05:16.875 --> 05:18.583
Aw man, I lost him.

05:18.583 --> 05:20.708
Where do we look now, Bingo?

05:20.708 --> 05:21.875
Bingo?

05:21.875 --> 05:23.583
Oh no, I lost you, too.

05:23.583 --> 05:24.875
Bingo:
I hear you, Rolly.

05:24.875 --> 05:27.083
Oh right, we can still talk
on our walkie-talkies.

05:27.083 --> 05:28.500
If you tell me
some of the things

05:28.500 --> 05:29.708
you see around you,

05:29.708 --> 05:31.250
then I'll know
if I'm getting close.

05:31.250 --> 05:35.083
Okay, I'm in a beautiful
orange coral cave.

05:35.083 --> 05:37.208
And I'm in a beautiful
yellow cave.

05:37.208 --> 05:38.583
So we're not in
the same cave.

05:38.583 --> 05:39.458
Keep swimming, Rolly.

05:39.458 --> 05:41.875
Okay, I'm coming up
to a red tunnel

05:41.875 --> 05:43.750
that turns into purple.
Do you see it?

05:43.750 --> 05:45.708
I see a purple tunnel
that turns into red.

05:45.708 --> 05:47.125
I think I see something.

05:47.125 --> 05:49.583
It's small, cute,
and kind of looks like a puppy.

05:49.583 --> 05:50.833
I see the same thing!

05:50.833 --> 05:52.333
I found you!

05:52.333 --> 05:53.708
And I found you!

05:53.708 --> 05:55.458
Did you see any boxes?

05:55.458 --> 05:57.375
-No.
-Me neither.

05:57.375 --> 05:59.500
The delivery woman
said it fell off a boat.

05:59.500 --> 06:00.833
Let's head back
to the surface

06:00.833 --> 06:02.583
and look for any boats
we can see!

06:02.583 --> 06:04.458
Maybe one of them
will be the right boat.

06:06.708 --> 06:08.458
I don't see
any boats, Bingo.

06:08.458 --> 06:10.250
I don't see
any anything.

06:12.208 --> 06:13.500
(both sputtering)

06:13.500 --> 06:16.125
Wait! I see
some something.

06:17.458 --> 06:19.458
Bingo:
Bow to the wow,
it's Whaley!

06:19.458 --> 06:21.000
-Whoa!
-Oh, whoa!

06:22.625 --> 06:23.750
Ahoy!

06:23.750 --> 06:25.333
Hello, puppy pals.

06:25.333 --> 06:27.458
What are you doing
way out here?

06:27.458 --> 06:30.000
Are you on vacation
with your family, too?

06:30.000 --> 06:31.875
We're on a mission to find
a lost box of Bob's

06:31.875 --> 06:32.958
that fell off a boat.

06:32.958 --> 06:35.583
Oh! Well, I just saw a boat.

06:35.583 --> 06:36.708
Both (gasp): You did?!

06:36.708 --> 06:39.083
Yeah, but it's
under the water.

06:39.083 --> 06:40.583
There was a box
in it, though.

06:40.583 --> 06:42.208
Maybe it's Bob's box.

06:42.208 --> 06:44.625
If you want to look,
just go straight down.

06:44.625 --> 06:45.875
You can't miss it.

06:45.875 --> 06:48.416
Got it. Hey, why don't
you come with us?

06:48.416 --> 06:49.708
I would,

06:49.708 --> 06:52.000
but I've got to catch up
with my family.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.708
I better go.

06:53.708 --> 06:55.708
Okay, then.
Thanks, Whaley.

06:55.708 --> 06:57.333
Say hi to your family!

06:57.333 --> 06:58.583
Okay, Sea Pup Rolly,

06:58.583 --> 07:00.333
straight down we go!

07:00.333 --> 07:02.416
I'm right behind you,
Sea Pup Bingo!

07:04.708 --> 07:06.375
Ooh!

07:07.416 --> 07:09.458
Look! It's the
underwater boat!

07:09.458 --> 07:11.583
Just like Whaley said.

07:11.583 --> 07:13.625
High-paw!

07:13.625 --> 07:16.166
Rolly:
Wow, this boat
must have been pretty cool

07:16.166 --> 07:17.625
before it went
glug-glug-glug

07:17.625 --> 07:19.291
and sank to the bottom
of the ocean.

07:19.291 --> 07:21.875
Hey, you don't think this
was a pirate ship, do you?

07:21.875 --> 07:23.333
I do now!

07:23.333 --> 07:24.958
Arrr, matey!

07:24.958 --> 07:26.708
Remember,
we're looking for a box

07:26.708 --> 07:28.583
with paw prints
inside a bubble!

07:28.583 --> 07:31.375
Yeah, then sad Bob
will be glad Bob.

the missing box for Bob.

08:32.708 --> 08:35.708
I know. The only box
around here is this one.

08:35.708 --> 08:37.458
Wait, maybe that's Bob's!

08:37.458 --> 08:39.375
It does have
a picture on the side

08:39.375 --> 08:40.833
like Bob's missing box.

08:40.833 --> 08:42.500
Yeah,
but it's not a picture

08:42.500 --> 08:44.250

08:45.458 --> 08:47.625
Even if this was
the box for Bob,

08:47.625 --> 08:49.625
I don't know what he'd do
with all of these coins

08:49.625 --> 08:51.250
and jewels
and sparkly stuff.

08:51.250 --> 08:52.833
Me neither.

08:52.833 --> 08:55.375
But ARF said there were
thousands of sea creatures
around here.

08:55.375 --> 08:57.458
Maybe one of them saw
the box fall off the boat.

08:57.458 --> 08:59.375
Then let's go find
a sea creature.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.708
-(octopus laughing)
-(bell ringing)

09:12.750 --> 09:15.000
Uh, Bingo?
Are you swimming?

09:15.000 --> 09:16.708
I thought I was.
Are you?

09:16.708 --> 09:18.000
I think so.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.416
Well, then, why aren't
we moving anywhere?

09:20.416 --> 09:22.833
Well, if the wind wants
us to go this way,

09:22.833 --> 09:25.458
maybe it wanted the box
to go this way, too!

09:25.458 --> 09:27.125
(clears throat)

09:27.125 --> 09:30.000
Oh, yeah!
This is a lot easier.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.625
Bye, octopus!

09:32.750 --> 09:34.750
-(laughing)
-(bell ringing)

09:34.750 --> 09:37.125
Rolly:
Hey, look at all that sand
on top of the water!

09:37.125 --> 09:39.750
Rolly! That's a
beautiful, green island,

09:39.750 --> 09:41.083
like ARF told us about.

09:41.083 --> 09:43.958
Oh yeah! Maybe that's where
Bob's missing box ended up!

09:43.958 --> 09:45.750
I don't know
if the box is there,

09:45.750 --> 09:47.708
but I do see
something familiar:

09:47.708 --> 09:49.458
it's Jonathan
the seagull!

09:49.458 --> 09:53.375
♪ Well my my my
it's Bingo and Rolly! ♪

09:53.375 --> 09:55.458
Hey, Jonathan,
what are you doing here?

09:55.458 --> 09:58.583
This island is one of
my favorite places to go

09:58.583 --> 10:00.833
because this is where
all the neat stuff

10:00.833 --> 10:03.958
that falls off boats
washes up on shore.

10:03.958 --> 10:06.083
And now
we washed up on shore!

10:06.083 --> 10:07.958
Except we weren't
on a boat.

10:07.958 --> 10:10.958
Yeah, but we're looking
for a box that fell off one.

10:10.958 --> 10:12.875
Well, then you've come
to the right spot.

10:12.875 --> 10:15.416
Uh, what does the box look like?

10:15.416 --> 10:17.208
Well, if it looks
like Bob's box,

10:17.208 --> 10:18.875
it's boxy and--

10:18.875 --> 10:20.166
And on one side
is a picture

10:20.166 --> 10:21.875
of a paw print
inside a bubble.

10:21.875 --> 10:25.583
Hmm, box with a
paw print inside a bubble,

10:25.583 --> 10:29.416
box with a paw print
inside a bubble.

10:29.416 --> 10:31.125
Nope, haven't seen it.

10:31.125 --> 10:33.208
Bow to the wow, look!

10:33.208 --> 10:35.000
It's a paw print
inside a bubble!

10:35.000 --> 10:36.875
This is Bob's lost box!
We found it!

10:36.875 --> 10:37.875
Jonathan
was standing

10:37.875 --> 10:39.833
in front of it
this whole time!

10:39.833 --> 10:41.000
Here, I'll help you grab it.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.416
Not so fast, puppies.

10:43.416 --> 10:45.000
If you take this box,

10:45.000 --> 10:47.333
what am I gonna
stand on all day?

10:47.333 --> 10:48.583
What about that box?

10:51.000 --> 10:52.125
Ooh! Oh!

10:52.125 --> 10:54.000
This is a nice one!

10:54.000 --> 10:56.208
(laughs, scats)

10:59.208 --> 11:00.500
Wow!

11:03.375 --> 11:05.083
Bingo:
There's not as much
to see in this pool

11:05.083 --> 11:06.375
as there was
to see in the ocean.

11:06.375 --> 11:07.958
Bob:
Hey, pals!

11:07.958 --> 11:10.208
It's my favorite
deep-sea divers!

11:10.208 --> 11:11.458
-Bob!
-Bob! Bob!

11:12.500 --> 11:13.958
Still swimming, huh?

11:13.958 --> 11:15.000
(laughs)

11:15.000 --> 11:16.583
Wait a second.

11:17.833 --> 11:19.291
The lost box?

11:19.291 --> 11:21.000
Oh! Someone
must have found it

11:21.000 --> 11:23.291
and then delivered it
right here!

11:23.291 --> 11:25.083
Yeah!
We found it, Bob!

11:25.083 --> 11:26.416
Jonathan
was sitting on it!

11:26.416 --> 11:28.291
Oh, this is so exciting.

11:28.291 --> 11:31.000
I can't wait for you two
to see what I got you!

11:31.000 --> 11:32.625
Did you hear that, Bingo?

11:32.625 --> 11:35.000
These boxes are for us!

11:35.000 --> 11:36.833
Do you pups know
what these are?

11:36.833 --> 11:38.000
Little fans?

11:38.000 --> 11:41.416
Attached to things that look
like flippery froggy feet?

11:41.416 --> 11:42.958
(whirring)

11:42.958 --> 11:46.208
They're special flippers
just for dogs

11:46.208 --> 11:49.166
that can help you
swim even faster.
(laughs)

11:49.166 --> 11:50.750
-Faster?
-Yeah!

11:50.750 --> 11:51.875
We're already
pretty fast.

11:55.708 --> 11:57.000
Oh! Whoa!

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
This is faster!

11:59.000 --> 12:00.583
Rolly:
Look! I'm a little
motorboat.

12:00.583 --> 12:01.875
(Rolly sputtering)

12:01.875 --> 12:04.750
Okay. Now those
are pretty cool.

12:04.750 --> 12:05.875
Ahoy, puppies!

12:05.875 --> 12:07.083
-Ahoy, Hissy!
-Ahoy, Hissy!

12:07.083 --> 12:08.458
And thanks, Bob!

12:08.458 --> 12:09.833
Yeah, Bob. Thanks!

12:09.833 --> 12:12.166
-(barking)
-Go scuba doggies!

12:12.166 --> 12:14.500
Go! (laughing)

12:16.833 --> 12:18.458
(Bingo and Rolly speak)

12:18.458 --> 12:20.875
Bob:
Thanks for checking
my eyes, Doc!

12:20.875 --> 12:23.500
I-I'll make sure to keep
these sunglasses on

12:23.500 --> 12:24.875
for the rest of the day,

12:24.875 --> 12:27.000
just like you told me to.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.083
How'd it go with
the eye doctor, Bob?

12:29.083 --> 12:32.000
Oh. Easy as blueberry pie!

12:32.000 --> 12:33.750
(barking)

12:33.750 --> 12:36.375
Oh, are those my
puppy dogs I hear?

12:36.375 --> 12:37.833
I've been having
a little fun with them.

12:39.958 --> 12:41.583
Don't they look cute?

12:41.583 --> 12:43.166
Bob:
Well, I'm sure they do,

12:43.166 --> 12:45.000
but I can't see
them very well.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.500
The eye doctor put
some drops in my eyes

12:47.500 --> 12:49.375
for a special test
this time around,

12:49.375 --> 12:52.708
so I'm gonna be seeing things
blurry for the rest of the day.

12:52.708 --> 12:54.708
Well, here are
your puppies' leashes

12:54.708 --> 12:56.000
so you can
walk them home.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.625
Uh, oh, where?

12:58.625 --> 13:00.000
Oh!

13:00.000 --> 13:01.083
Whoa!

13:01.083 --> 13:02.500
(grunting)

13:03.583 --> 13:05.583
Oh, got 'em. Thanks.

13:05.583 --> 13:07.958
Bob might need
a little help getting home,

13:07.958 --> 13:10.500
so you two be extra good
puppies on the way, okay?

13:10.500 --> 13:13.875
-(barking)
-And away we go!

13:13.875 --> 13:15.416
-Whoa!
-(objects clatter)

13:15.416 --> 13:16.750
Did you hear that, Rolly?

13:16.750 --> 13:18.208
Bob can't see very well,

13:18.208 --> 13:20.125
so we need to help
him get home.

13:20.125 --> 13:21.458
Cool! That can be our mission.

13:22.583 --> 13:25.416
Oops! (chuckles)
Sorry, sir.

13:27.166 --> 13:29.291
That's not a sir,
it's a coatrack.

13:29.291 --> 13:32.708
I don't think Bob knows
because of his blurry eyes.

13:32.708 --> 13:35.000
Are we gonna have
to show him the way home?

13:35.000 --> 13:36.750
We're gonna lead the way.

13:36.750 --> 13:38.583
Come on, Bob! Follow us!

13:38.583 --> 13:40.625
(barking)

13:40.625 --> 13:43.625
Okay, ready
for the walk home.

13:43.625 --> 13:45.833
Bob's house is...

13:45.833 --> 13:46.875
this way!

13:48.458 --> 13:53.000
Now, I'm pretty sure
my house is that way.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.625
Look, Mommy.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.166
It's Mr. Bob
and his puppies.

13:56.166 --> 13:58.875
Hey! Is that
my neighbors I hear?

13:58.875 --> 14:00.166
-Oh, hi, Bob.
-(barking)

14:00.166 --> 14:01.083
Where you headed?

14:01.083 --> 14:03.458
Well, my puppies
and I are headed home,

14:03.458 --> 14:06.291
so maybe we'll see you
when we get there!
(laughs)

14:06.291 --> 14:08.500
(barking)

14:08.500 --> 14:09.875
Whoa!

14:09.875 --> 14:12.166
Our house is that way!

14:12.166 --> 14:13.625
(barking)

14:13.625 --> 14:17.583
I love how excited you two
get when we go on walks!

14:17.583 --> 14:22.083
Mommy, isn't Mr, Bob's house
in the other direction?

14:22.083 --> 14:24.875
It is, but he's probably
gonna do some shopping

14:24.875 --> 14:26.000
before he goes home.

14:29.875 --> 14:31.125
Huh?

14:35.166 --> 14:37.166
Bingo:
Whoa! This is a busy park.

14:37.166 --> 14:38.416
(barking)

14:38.416 --> 14:40.083
(laughing)

14:40.083 --> 14:42.000
(barking)

14:42.000 --> 14:44.333
Oh. Lovely day
for a walk, isn't it?

14:44.333 --> 14:46.291
-Oops!
-Oh! I'm terribly sorry.

14:46.291 --> 14:47.708
-Come on, boys.
-Huh?

14:48.958 --> 14:50.416
Good leading,
Bingo and Rolly.

14:50.416 --> 14:52.416
Um, e-excuse me!

14:52.416 --> 14:54.000
-That's not Bingo and Rolly.
-We are!

14:54.000 --> 14:56.708
(barking frantically)

14:56.708 --> 15:00.375
Whoa!
Well, we meet again.
(chuckles)

15:00.375 --> 15:01.958
(whines)

15:04.000 --> 15:05.708
Whew! That was a close one.

15:05.708 --> 15:07.083
We gotta be more careful.

15:09.291 --> 15:11.208
(straining)

15:11.208 --> 15:12.291
-Whoa!
-Wait.

15:12.291 --> 15:16.083
On second thought,
I think home is that way.
(chuckles)

15:16.083 --> 15:18.708
The most important part
of leading the way right now

15:18.708 --> 15:20.875
is to make sure
we get Bob home safe.

15:20.875 --> 15:22.416
So let's make sure!

15:22.416 --> 15:24.375
I smell a song coming on.

15:27.833 --> 15:29.083

16:01.166 --> 16:02.750
(laughs)

Aren't we back
where we started though?

16:29.000 --> 16:31.166
Yep. This mission is
harder than we thought.

16:33.958 --> 16:35.125
(sniffing)

16:35.125 --> 16:38.083
Mmm! Those flowers smell nice!

16:38.083 --> 16:40.166
At least Bob's nose
is working,

16:40.166 --> 16:42.083
even if his eyes aren't.

16:42.083 --> 16:44.333
I think I'll buy some
flowers to take home,

16:44.333 --> 16:47.583
so I can look at 'em
after my vision clears up!

16:49.250 --> 16:51.833
Well, this must be the
flower store right here.

16:51.833 --> 16:53.583
(bell rings)

16:55.458 --> 16:58.166
Oh. Everything in here
is so colorful.

16:59.375 --> 17:02.166
Ha! I don't know
which ones to pick.

17:02.166 --> 17:04.833
Hi! You looking for
anything in particular?

17:04.833 --> 17:08.291
Nope, but I'll know it
when I smell it.

17:10.208 --> 17:11.875
(sniffing)

17:13.333 --> 17:14.583
Huh?

17:14.583 --> 17:16.208
Wow, there's a lot
of instruments

17:16.208 --> 17:17.875
in this flower store!

17:17.875 --> 17:19.458
That's 'cause
it's not a flower store.

17:19.458 --> 17:21.500
It's a music store.

17:21.500 --> 17:24.125
Bob thinks
he's buying flowers.

17:24.125 --> 17:25.875
(sniffing)

17:25.875 --> 17:28.583
Uh, do you like that one?

17:28.583 --> 17:32.333
I don't know.
It smells kind of funny.

17:33.875 --> 17:35.083
Hmm.

17:35.083 --> 17:38.333
This one's probably
too big to fit in a vase.

17:40.583 --> 17:43.333
Now those look perfect.

17:43.333 --> 17:46.166
I'll take a dozen
of those, please.

17:54.708 --> 17:57.375
Oh, they'll look
great in a vase!

17:57.375 --> 17:59.708
(bell rings)

18:01.250 --> 18:04.583
A pretty flower
for a pretty lady.

18:08.708 --> 18:10.958
Uh, thank you?

18:13.291 --> 18:14.250
Huh?

18:14.250 --> 18:15.708
This way, guys.

18:15.708 --> 18:17.291
We'll be home in no time!

18:18.416 --> 18:19.833
(trolley bell rings)

18:20.833 --> 18:23.458
Oh! We've been
walking so much.

18:23.458 --> 18:26.250
I thought for sure
I'd see our house by now.

18:26.250 --> 18:28.291
Even though it's still
hard for me to see.

18:28.291 --> 18:29.458
Esther:
Oh, Frank!

18:29.458 --> 18:32.125
I just love this store.

18:33.125 --> 18:34.958
They sell fresh fruit,

18:34.958 --> 18:37.375
sporting goods,
and wind chimes!

18:37.375 --> 18:39.500
Frank:
Everything I need
for a happy life.

18:39.500 --> 18:42.625
Hmm, I should buy some
fresh fruit to take home.

18:42.625 --> 18:44.875
Let's go into
this store, pups!

18:48.708 --> 18:51.583
Beautiful day,
isn't it, ma'am?

18:52.875 --> 18:55.458
It looks like Bob still
can hardly see at all.

18:55.458 --> 18:57.500
Yeah, we'd better
help him out!

19:00.708 --> 19:02.875
(Muzak playing)

19:02.875 --> 19:06.125
Wow! This place sure is big.

19:06.125 --> 19:09.291
Hmm. I wonder
where they sell the fruit.

19:13.250 --> 19:15.166
Huh. Maybe the fruit's
down here.

19:15.166 --> 19:18.000
Oh no, Bob's
heading the wrong way.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.125
How are we gonna get him

19:19.125 --> 19:21.000
to the part of the store
where the fruit is?

19:26.583 --> 19:28.208
I have an idea.

19:29.625 --> 19:31.625
I don't know what
kind of fruit this is,

19:31.625 --> 19:33.500
but it's way too hard to eat.

19:40.416 --> 19:43.958
Wow, this has got to be
the biggest orange ever!

19:47.416 --> 19:49.708
Oh! Whoops. Excuse me.

19:51.291 --> 19:54.333
Oof! Uh-oh.
That way's blocked.

19:54.333 --> 19:56.375
Whew! Good plan, Bingo.

19:56.375 --> 19:59.166
This should lead him
to where the fruit is.

20:00.625 --> 20:02.291
The fruit
is over here, Bob!

20:02.291 --> 20:03.416
(barking)

20:03.416 --> 20:05.958
I didn't know you two
loved shopping so much.

20:08.416 --> 20:09.458
(panting)

20:11.708 --> 20:14.000
Hey! This feels just right.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.291
We did it!

20:15.291 --> 20:16.833
High-paw!

20:16.833 --> 20:18.875
Two at a time!

20:18.875 --> 20:21.166
(chuckles)
Got everything we need.

20:21.166 --> 20:23.875
Baseball, grapefruits,
and wind chimes.

20:23.875 --> 20:26.125
Oh, I could just
live in this store

20:26.125 --> 20:27.375
if they'd only let me!

20:27.375 --> 20:29.583
Whoops! sorry.

20:29.583 --> 20:31.500
My eyes are still
a bit blurry.

20:31.500 --> 20:33.458
Could you point me
towards the check-out?

20:33.458 --> 20:36.000
Sure!
It's right over there.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.458
Thanks. Just got
to pay for this stuff

20:38.458 --> 20:40.208
and then head home!

20:43.125 --> 20:44.708
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

20:44.708 --> 20:47.291
Huh. If I'd known
it was gonna rain today,

20:47.291 --> 20:49.500
I would've brought a hat
to keep my head dry.

20:53.750 --> 20:55.125
Rolly:
It's not raining.

20:55.125 --> 20:56.458
It's just plant-watering.

20:56.458 --> 20:58.333
I guess Bob can't
tell the difference.

21:01.875 --> 21:04.250
Well, it's hard to see
for sure, but...

21:04.250 --> 21:05.958
maybe they sell hats in here.

21:05.958 --> 21:08.375
That's the music store
again, Bob!

21:08.375 --> 21:10.416
They don't sell flowers
or hats in there!

21:10.416 --> 21:13.083
(barking)

21:13.083 --> 21:14.333
(bell rings)

21:19.000 --> 21:20.458
(cash register chimes)

21:20.458 --> 21:22.458
There we go.

21:22.458 --> 21:24.083
It's a perfect fit.

21:24.083 --> 21:26.416
Huh. I wish I knew
the fastest way

21:26.416 --> 21:27.583
to walk home from here.

21:28.583 --> 21:30.458
That bus would be
a fast way.

21:30.458 --> 21:33.125
But Bob said
he wants to walk.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.291
Then we'll lead the way

21:34.291 --> 21:36.500
and make sure
he keeps walking.

21:36.500 --> 21:39.500
You wanna go this way?
Okay.

21:39.500 --> 21:41.625
Whoops!
Didn't see those steps.

21:45.583 --> 21:48.208
Boy, this sidewalk
got crowded.

21:48.208 --> 21:51.458
Well, I guess I'm not the only
one trying to walk home.

21:51.458 --> 21:53.125
Oh! Excuse me.

21:54.333 --> 21:56.416
-Sorry.
-This way, Rolly.

21:56.416 --> 21:58.375
Rolly:
And we'll bring Bob
this way, too!

22:00.083 --> 22:03.500
I'm glad the sidewalk's
not so crowded anymore.

22:03.500 --> 22:06.250
And I can just barely see it,

22:06.250 --> 22:09.583
but I'm pretty sure
that's my house right there!

22:09.583 --> 22:11.458
-We did it!
-Yay!

22:11.458 --> 22:13.375
(barking)

22:13.375 --> 22:14.458
Hey there, Bob!

22:14.458 --> 22:16.166
Looks like you
did some shopping

22:16.166 --> 22:17.458
and finally
made it home!

22:17.458 --> 22:20.500
(giggling)
Your puppies, too!

22:20.500 --> 22:22.291
Yep.
All three of us got here

22:22.291 --> 22:24.708
with no problem at all.

22:28.125 --> 22:30.458
I like your silly hat.

22:30.458 --> 22:32.000
You know what?

22:32.000 --> 22:34.833
Since it's not raining,
I don't need it anymore.

22:34.833 --> 22:38.250
Maybe Chloe would like
to have it, instead.

22:38.250 --> 22:39.875
Can I, Mommy?

22:39.875 --> 22:42.291
-Please?
-Sure.

22:42.291 --> 22:46.708
And my two favorite neighbors
can have two of these, too.

22:46.708 --> 22:49.875
(laughs)
I guess they do go
with the "hat."

22:49.875 --> 22:52.250
Thanks, Mr. Bob!

22:52.250 --> 22:54.833
Come on, guys,
I need to get some rest.

22:54.833 --> 22:57.458
I feel like I've been
walking all day!

23:00.458 --> 23:02.375
(rooster crows)

23:03.750 --> 23:05.583
(snoring)

23:05.583 --> 23:09.708
(chuckling)
Good morning,
my perky little pets!

23:09.708 --> 23:12.166
-(snores)
-It's Bob!

23:12.166 --> 23:14.166
He's awake!

23:14.166 --> 23:17.875
I wonder if he can see
the same way he used to?

23:17.875 --> 23:20.125
(barking)

23:20.125 --> 23:23.208
You know, there is nothing
I like to see more each morning

23:23.208 --> 23:24.583
than all three of you!
