00:01.051 --> 00:02.507
Hi, ready to order?

00:02.509 --> 00:04.425
Do you have anything
that's really special?

00:04.427 --> 00:07.679
Not according to my
high school guidance counselor.

00:07.681 --> 00:09.547
I'll have the veggie plate.

00:09.549 --> 00:11.516
But instead of beets,
I want kale.

00:11.518 --> 00:14.018
And instead of broccoli,
more kale.

00:14.020 --> 00:16.020
I want the veggies steamed.

00:16.021 --> 00:17.755
And instead of dressing,
I want lemons.

00:17.757 --> 00:19.691
Don't you need
to write this down?

00:19.693 --> 00:21.526
I'm afraid if I start
writing that down,

00:21.528 --> 00:24.812
it'll turn into a suicide note.

00:24.814 --> 00:26.231
I'm assuming
this table's gonna have

00:26.233 --> 00:27.866
a lot more of those requests.

00:27.868 --> 00:30.902
Yes, I could tell by the hats.

00:31.022 --> 00:40.632
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrected by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

00:40.863 --> 00:44.082
Earl, I have something new
I want you to try.

00:44.084 --> 00:46.000
That's the exact same sentence

00:46.002 --> 00:48.953
that got me hooked
on cocaine in the '80s.

00:48.955 --> 00:51.389
It's my new cupcake flavor.

00:51.391 --> 00:54.976
Delicious dark chocolate
the ladies can't help but love.

00:54.978 --> 00:57.178
I'm calling it
"The Earl."

00:57.180 --> 01:00.064
I know you got that right.

01:00.066 --> 01:01.316
Hi, I'm here.

01:01.318 --> 01:03.467
I was running late
so I decided to hail a cab.

01:03.469 --> 01:05.636
And then I remembered I didn't
have any money on me.

01:05.638 --> 01:08.022
And then I remembered
I didn't have any money at all.

01:08.024 --> 01:10.692
So I walked the whole way here.

01:10.694 --> 01:12.944
The apartment's
three blocks away.

01:12.946 --> 01:13.995
Yes, I know.

01:13.997 --> 01:16.480
Three blocks
and 15 "Hola chicas" away.

01:16.482 --> 01:19.033
Well, you can't be late again.

01:19.035 --> 01:20.952
I'm already worried
about me being late...

01:20.954 --> 01:23.154
every month.

01:23.156 --> 01:26.207
On my way here, a homeless man
asked me for money.

01:26.209 --> 01:28.626
And I told him
that I usually always give,

01:28.628 --> 01:31.095
but that my father was indicted
in a Ponzi scandal

01:31.097 --> 01:34.098
and I've lost my family fortune
and my Manhattan townhouse,

01:34.100 --> 01:36.500
so I've been sleeping
on a couch in Brooklyn,

01:36.502 --> 01:38.469
but, in spite of it all,
I'm still optimistic

01:38.471 --> 01:40.221
that you and I
will achieve success

01:40.223 --> 01:43.007
in our exciting new cupcake
business venture.

01:43.009 --> 01:45.476
And look what he gave me!

01:45.478 --> 01:48.229
You took money
from a homeless man?

01:48.231 --> 01:50.565
I prefer to think
of Bob near the bridge

01:50.567 --> 01:52.150
as our first investor.

01:52.152 --> 01:55.036
Pickup!
Special sandwich.

01:55.038 --> 01:57.405
I can think
of even more special sandwich.

01:57.407 --> 02:02.043
You, me
and the hot blonde giraffe.

02:02.045 --> 02:04.712
Well, she recently
lost her dignity,

02:04.714 --> 02:06.347
so you might have a shot.

02:06.349 --> 02:09.417
Hello today!

02:09.419 --> 02:11.085
I have nametag for you.

02:11.087 --> 02:14.055
Only your second day
and look, nametag already.

02:14.057 --> 02:16.674
As new owner, I am killing it.

02:16.676 --> 02:17.708
Thank you.

02:17.710 --> 02:19.143
Oh, it says "Carolin."

02:19.145 --> 02:21.095
It's Caroline.
With an "E."

02:21.097 --> 02:22.880
I'm Caroline.

02:22.882 --> 02:25.400
As new owner, I am sucking it.

02:25.402 --> 02:27.385
Just put it on.

02:27.387 --> 02:29.070
You can't tell an Asian
he made a mistake.

02:29.072 --> 02:32.040
He'll go in the back
and throw himself on a sword.

02:32.042 --> 02:33.691
Thank you,
Mr. Lee.

02:33.693 --> 02:35.076
You may call me Han.

02:35.078 --> 02:36.694
H-a-n.

02:36.696 --> 02:38.613
No trap in my name.

02:38.615 --> 02:40.915
I'm thinking we should take

02:40.917 --> 02:43.167
the first step
in our new cupcake business

02:43.169 --> 02:45.236
by writing
"Max's Homemade Cupcakes"

02:45.238 --> 02:46.571
up on the specials board.

02:46.573 --> 02:48.239
No, I can't have
my name up there.

02:48.241 --> 02:51.426
Everyone I owe money to
thinks I live in Seattle.

02:51.428 --> 02:55.680
Oh, we used to own Seattle.

02:55.682 --> 02:57.932
Max, we've got to get
the name out there.

02:57.934 --> 02:58.966
Create a buzz.

02:58.968 --> 03:00.051
Ooh, good idea!

03:00.053 --> 03:00.968
Let's create a buzz.

03:00.970 --> 03:02.236
Exactly,
in order to launch--

03:02.238 --> 03:04.722
I'm mocking you.

03:04.724 --> 03:06.607
When in doubt,
I'm always mocking you.

03:06.609 --> 03:08.109
Seriously, Max.

03:08.111 --> 03:10.478
This new cupcake business
is our lifeline.

03:10.480 --> 03:12.230
A way out for both of us.

03:12.232 --> 03:15.233
And I wanna thank you again
for letting me move in.

03:15.235 --> 03:17.485
If there's anything
I can do to help you--

03:17.487 --> 03:20.154
You mean besides
starting to wait on tables?

03:20.156 --> 03:21.572
I meant, anything I can do

03:21.574 --> 03:24.208
to help you through
your breakup with Robbie.

03:24.210 --> 03:27.628
Oh. Thanks,
but I'm fine.

03:27.630 --> 03:28.696
And we're working.

03:28.698 --> 03:31.082
Well, one of us is.

03:31.084 --> 03:32.934
Are you sure you're fine?

03:32.936 --> 03:35.136
'Cause I heard you
crying last night.

03:35.138 --> 03:36.471
I don't cry.

03:36.473 --> 03:40.975
I sold my tear ducts to an organ
bank for cash two years ago.

03:40.977 --> 03:42.543
I was on the couch.

03:42.545 --> 03:45.396
And I heard you crying alone
in your bedroom.

03:45.398 --> 03:48.232
Really?
What did the crying sound like?

03:48.234 --> 03:53.488
Like...

03:54.973 --> 03:56.357
I wasn't crying.

03:56.359 --> 03:57.575
Well, then what
were you d--

03:57.577 --> 04:01.145
Oh! So none of
my business.

04:01.147 --> 04:03.614
That's right.
And remember that.

04:03.616 --> 04:04.982
Got it.

04:04.984 --> 04:06.284
In fact, let's just say
that anything having to do

04:06.286 --> 04:09.170
with my bedroom, my tables,
or my life--

04:09.172 --> 04:10.254
you should stay away from.

04:10.256 --> 04:11.655
Boundaries.
Got it.

04:11.657 --> 04:15.326
And please
don't tell anyone at work

04:15.328 --> 04:16.827
I let you move
into my apartment.

04:16.829 --> 04:19.329
That is one boundary
we both don't want crossed.

04:19.332 --> 04:21.298
Why?

04:21.301 --> 04:23.301
Hey, roomies.

04:23.303 --> 04:25.486
That's why.

04:31.933 --> 04:33.265
Hope those sheets are okay.

04:33.573 --> 04:34.507
Oh, don't worry about it.

04:34.627 --> 04:36.042
I know they're the best
you could afford.

04:36.993 --> 04:39.827
Not really.
The good ones are on my bed.

04:39.829 --> 04:42.079
Max, that oven is so hot.

04:42.081 --> 04:44.398
Could you do me a favor
and open the back door?

04:44.400 --> 04:45.499
We've known each other two days

04:45.501 --> 04:47.901
and you're already
asking for back door?

04:55.343 --> 04:57.344
Dear God!

04:57.346 --> 04:59.680
I forgot
you're Equestrian Barbie.

04:59.682 --> 05:02.366
You came with a horse.

05:02.368 --> 05:04.185
No.

05:04.187 --> 05:07.087
Out, horse, bad!
Bad horse.

05:07.089 --> 05:12.977
Chestnut.

05:12.979 --> 05:16.363
No need to yell,
he's a champion.

05:16.365 --> 05:18.315
Champion stink bomb.

05:18.317 --> 05:20.401
It's smelling pretty ripe
out in that yard.

05:20.403 --> 05:23.537
That's not Chestnut,
that's Brooklyn.

05:23.539 --> 05:25.939
Okay, well, I'm watching
"The Champion"

05:25.941 --> 05:31.245
drop some steaming hot
"Brooklyn" right now.

05:31.247 --> 05:34.365
Max, I've been thinking about
how you completely overreacted

05:34.367 --> 05:36.383
to your name
up on the specials board.

05:36.385 --> 05:38.419
Do you think it's
a fear of success?

05:38.421 --> 05:41.972
I am too poor
to have a fear of success.

05:41.974 --> 05:43.591
At Wharton Business School,
we learned

05:43.593 --> 05:46.060
that every new venture can bring
up a certain amount of fear.

05:46.062 --> 05:48.229
Is there any way
to do a yelp review

05:48.231 --> 05:50.514
of Wharton Business School?

05:50.516 --> 05:53.851
Maybe you're having
a hard time imagining

05:53.853 --> 05:55.819
this cupcake business
could ever even happen

05:55.821 --> 05:59.156
because nobody ever believed
in you or your dreams.

05:59.158 --> 06:00.391
I'm guessing.

06:00.393 --> 06:03.310
I can make this happen, Max.

06:03.312 --> 06:05.646
For me, for you, for us.

06:05.648 --> 06:07.781
Just keep making
those amazing cupcakes.

06:07.783 --> 06:10.484
And I'll do the rest
till you believe.

06:10.486 --> 06:11.952
I believe
everything you just said

06:11.954 --> 06:15.172
and that children
are the future.

06:17.000 --> 06:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:34.342 --> 06:36.427
Max, it's me!

06:36.429 --> 06:39.513
I know it's you.

06:39.515 --> 06:41.532
You sleep with a knife
under your pillow?

06:41.534 --> 06:45.819
It's the only home security
system I can afford.

06:45.821 --> 06:48.021
And I'm a cutter.

06:48.023 --> 06:50.708
I can't sleep on that couch.

06:50.710 --> 06:54.878
I think Ikea might be the
Scandinavian word for sciatica.

06:54.880 --> 06:57.364
And there's weird sounds
in the street.

06:57.366 --> 06:59.717
And I don't have
my white noise machine.

06:59.719 --> 07:01.335
Well, that's
Puerto Rican noise.

07:01.337 --> 07:02.536
You'll get used to it.

07:02.538 --> 07:05.806
Can I just lay down here
and get a little sleep?

07:05.808 --> 07:08.726
I don't even let the men
I sleep with sleep with me.

07:08.728 --> 07:11.478
I can't get into
your issues right now.

07:11.480 --> 07:13.514
I just need to sleep!

07:13.516 --> 07:17.151
Fine, get in then.

07:17.153 --> 07:18.686
What is that?

07:18.688 --> 07:22.323
Potato chips.
I sleep-eat.

07:22.325 --> 07:24.808
Cool ranch and bacon?

07:24.810 --> 07:26.893
Dude, they're delicious.

07:26.895 --> 07:28.996
Because of your breakup
with Robbie?

07:28.998 --> 07:30.280
Just get in.

07:30.282 --> 07:33.534
I have to be in the city
to babysit in five hours.

07:38.740 --> 07:40.407
Oh, great,
you're like a nightlight.

07:40.409 --> 07:45.179
You're so blonde.

07:45.181 --> 07:47.881
Thank you.

07:49.018 --> 07:53.604
Max, someone's
in the living room.

07:53.606 --> 07:56.273
Max, someone's in the bedroom!

07:56.275 --> 07:57.691
Robbie!

07:57.693 --> 07:59.493
What's up, babe?

07:59.495 --> 08:01.195
Robbie, what are you
doing here?

08:01.197 --> 08:02.596
We broke up.

08:02.598 --> 08:04.565
Still?

08:04.567 --> 08:06.450
Yes, still.
You hit on me.

08:06.452 --> 08:08.202
And then she caught you
with someone else

08:08.204 --> 08:09.603
in these very sheets.

08:09.605 --> 08:12.489
Which I'm hoping she washed.

08:12.491 --> 08:13.707
Oh, I get it.

08:13.709 --> 08:16.377
You blew me off
'cause you like the ladies.

08:16.379 --> 08:19.079
Which is cool.
I like the ladies, too.

08:19.081 --> 08:21.715
And right now,
it's the two ladies I like.

08:21.717 --> 08:23.717
Robbie, if I were
gonna go lesbian,

08:23.719 --> 08:27.337
she would be the last "les"
I'd "bian."

08:27.339 --> 08:28.972
Listen, babe--

08:28.974 --> 08:30.123
You really hurt her.

08:30.125 --> 08:31.225
Stop.

08:31.227 --> 08:34.227
She sleep-eats trans fats
thanks to you.

08:34.230 --> 08:36.296
Here, stuff all of these
in your mouth.

08:36.298 --> 08:40.967
Got it, your thing.
I'll be quiet.

08:40.969 --> 08:42.986
Robbie, this isn't cool at all.

08:42.988 --> 08:45.138
Mm-mm.

08:45.140 --> 08:47.307
Showing up here
after what you did?

08:47.309 --> 08:49.142
You go, girl.

08:49.144 --> 08:52.446
I have something to say to you
and you had better listen.

08:52.448 --> 08:56.483
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo.

08:56.485 --> 08:59.820
What are you,
the relationship ghost?

08:59.822 --> 09:01.288
Robbie, just go!

09:01.290 --> 09:04.258
I can't say what I need to in
front of the relationship ghost.

09:04.260 --> 09:06.093
I'll call you
to come get your stuff

09:06.095 --> 09:07.211
and we can talk then.

09:07.213 --> 09:08.495
Leave the key.

09:08.497 --> 09:12.599
Straight up, Max,
you're breaking my heart.

09:12.601 --> 09:15.719
You're the only woman
that I feel this way about.

09:19.557 --> 09:21.975
Here.

09:21.977 --> 09:24.228
Ladies, I don't know
what's going on here,

09:24.230 --> 09:27.448
but it would've been
a lot sexier if I was in it.

09:30.452 --> 09:32.786
Are you okay?

09:32.788 --> 09:35.188
If you wanna talk, I'm here.

09:35.190 --> 09:38.375
Can I get a hit off that?

09:43.865 --> 09:47.534
You think these are good?

09:47.536 --> 09:50.654
God, we're poor.

09:55.860 --> 09:56.927
Morning!

09:56.929 --> 09:58.545
It's a beautiful day.

09:58.547 --> 10:02.166
These shades belong down.

10:02.168 --> 10:04.268
From now on, think of me
as a vampire

10:04.270 --> 10:07.020
without all
the annoying marketing.

10:07.022 --> 10:08.272
Bad news.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.858
A pipe broke in the street
so the water's off.

10:10.860 --> 10:13.610
Good news, when I went out
to get us two coffees,

10:13.612 --> 10:16.897
I spoke to Juan and Javier,
two city workers.

10:16.899 --> 10:20.000
And they assured me the water'll
be on no later than 3:00.

10:20.002 --> 10:21.451
I also stopped
at the health food store

10:21.453 --> 10:23.237
and got us
a fresh-squeezed juice to split.

10:23.239 --> 10:25.005
It's ginger-apple-strawberry.

10:25.007 --> 10:26.239
That was the name of the hooker

10:26.241 --> 10:29.543
who had this apartment
before me.

10:31.412 --> 10:32.713
What is this?

10:32.715 --> 10:34.131
From me.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.350
It says "Thanks for letting me
sleep in your bed last night."

10:36.352 --> 10:39.887
I prefer my usual cash
on the bedside table.

10:39.889 --> 10:42.923
When I went
to the cute coffee place,

10:42.925 --> 10:45.258
I spoke to the counter girl,
Nabulangi--

10:45.260 --> 10:48.028
If someone named Nabulangi
is making an appearance

10:48.030 --> 10:50.013
in the first sentence,
I have to sit down.

10:50.015 --> 10:53.099
And she said
her manager'll be in at 11:00.

10:53.101 --> 10:55.602
So I thought I'd chanel it up,

10:55.604 --> 10:56.770
walk on over there,

10:56.772 --> 10:59.439
introduce myself
and your fabulous cupcakes.

10:59.441 --> 11:02.659
That's exactly what
I was gonna do.

11:02.661 --> 11:05.412
I'm just gonna go say good-bye
to Chestnut and get going.

11:05.414 --> 11:07.297
You know, having
only one cute outfit

11:07.299 --> 11:12.736
takes hours off
getting dressed.

11:12.738 --> 11:16.506
Oh. That is a lot
of fresh Brooklyn.

11:16.508 --> 11:17.958
Morning, Chestnut.

11:17.960 --> 11:19.927
It's a beautiful--

11:19.929 --> 11:24.130
No. Way.

11:34.309 --> 11:38.862
Look, Chanel Number Two.

11:38.864 --> 11:42.482
Tell me it's mud.

11:42.484 --> 11:44.150
T-tell me it's mud.

11:44.152 --> 11:46.670
It's mud?

11:46.672 --> 11:48.088
What is that?

11:48.090 --> 11:51.508
A carrot?

11:51.510 --> 11:54.711
There's carrots in the mud?

11:58.683 --> 12:00.851
There's no water.

12:00.853 --> 12:03.220
Oh, get it off me, please.

12:03.222 --> 12:04.221
Please do something.

12:04.223 --> 12:06.356
Just get it off me,
get it off me.

12:06.358 --> 12:07.391
Stop!

12:07.393 --> 12:08.842
This is dry-clean only.

12:08.844 --> 12:11.011
Max, please, please take me

12:11.013 --> 12:14.064
somewhere they have
a hot shower, I beg of you.

12:14.066 --> 12:15.517
Calm down, it's just mud.

12:15.637 --> 12:17.034
Max, please--

12:17.036 --> 12:19.620
Don't touch me!

12:24.951 --> 12:26.818
Thank you so much
for taking me to shower

12:26.820 --> 12:28.003
at your babysitting job.

12:28.005 --> 12:29.854
Well, I didn't have
much of a choice.

12:29.856 --> 12:32.290
You pulled the pillow knife
on me.

12:32.292 --> 12:33.491
I'll just introduce myself
to your boss

12:33.493 --> 12:35.476
and tell her what happened.

12:35.478 --> 12:36.494
Look, I don't want Peach
to know you were here.

12:36.496 --> 12:38.613
This is a job.
Not a meet-and-greet.

12:38.615 --> 12:39.814
Got it.

12:39.816 --> 12:41.333
You get in there, you
take a five-minute shower,

12:41.335 --> 12:42.817
clean it up and go.

12:42.819 --> 12:45.437
Fine, I'll hide in the hallway
till she's gone.

12:45.439 --> 12:48.840
No need, just follow me in.
She never really looks at me.

12:48.842 --> 12:50.175
Morning!

12:50.177 --> 12:52.794
Hi, Max.

12:52.796 --> 12:55.463
Go!

12:55.465 --> 12:56.497
Hey, Peach.

12:56.499 --> 12:58.383
Uh, hair and makeup.

12:58.385 --> 12:59.634
What's the big occasion?

12:59.636 --> 13:01.886
Pilates.

13:01.888 --> 13:04.005
Max, good news.

13:04.007 --> 13:06.941
They found a way
to make diamonds more sparkly?

13:06.943 --> 13:10.812
I got Brad and Angelina
a playdate

13:10.814 --> 13:13.114
with another set of twins
in the building.

13:13.116 --> 13:14.449
It starts in five minutes.

13:14.451 --> 13:15.567
Cool, what are their names?

13:15.569 --> 13:17.685
6B.

13:17.687 --> 13:19.654
Bye-bye,
Brangelina.

13:19.656 --> 13:21.122
Mommy loves you.

13:21.124 --> 13:23.208
Guys?
Before you leave,

13:23.210 --> 13:24.459
stop at this one.

13:24.461 --> 13:25.860
Angelina could
use a little help.

13:25.862 --> 13:28.880
Contour that neck,
she's a fatty.

13:28.882 --> 13:30.665
Peach, come on,
that's baby fat.

13:30.667 --> 13:33.168
Still, kids can be cruel.

13:33.170 --> 13:35.970
Don't you listen
to your mommy, Angelina.

13:35.972 --> 13:38.139
She never eats.

13:38.141 --> 13:41.309
Oh, no, she doesn't.

13:43.012 --> 13:44.696
Here it is.

13:44.698 --> 13:46.181
Caroline with an "E."

13:46.183 --> 13:48.382
I have your new
and correct nametag.

13:48.384 --> 13:49.768
Oh, thank you, Han.

13:49.770 --> 13:52.720
Oh.

13:52.722 --> 13:54.939
I've seen something
I should not have.

13:54.941 --> 13:58.559
I will just put correct nametag
here on counter.

13:58.561 --> 14:03.031
So sorry, but many thank yous.

14:03.033 --> 14:04.532
What are you doing?

14:04.534 --> 14:06.751
I know you said
you don't want it up there.

14:06.753 --> 14:08.736
But now that you see it...

14:08.738 --> 14:10.422
How does it feel?

14:10.424 --> 14:12.006
It feels like
you're not listening to me

14:12.008 --> 14:13.508
at this job or at my other job.

14:13.510 --> 14:15.427
I said a five-minute shower
and get out.

14:15.429 --> 14:17.011
Did you take a nap at Peach's?

14:17.013 --> 14:18.596
The thread count
was calling to me.

14:18.598 --> 14:21.382
Peach found blonde hairs
in her bed

14:21.384 --> 14:23.351
and thought her husband
was cheating on her.

14:23.353 --> 14:26.137
Which he is,
but that's not the point.

14:26.139 --> 14:28.807
You almost ruined
a perfectly happy fake marriage,

14:28.809 --> 14:30.475
and there are
innocent children involved.

14:30.477 --> 14:32.977
Well, I have some good news.

14:32.979 --> 14:34.596
Look, it's Nabulangi.

14:34.598 --> 14:36.614
I invited her in
to taste your amazing cupcakes.

14:36.616 --> 14:39.234
And when she loves them,
we'll have an in at her bakery.

14:39.236 --> 14:40.819
Come over and say hello.

14:40.821 --> 14:43.104
No, I can't now. I wanna call
Robbie before we get too busy.

14:43.106 --> 14:44.789
Tell him when to come over
and get his stuff.

14:44.791 --> 14:45.990
Max, wait.

14:45.992 --> 14:47.559
No, don't distract me.

14:47.561 --> 14:49.210
I wanna sound cool and hot
and all like,

14:49.212 --> 14:52.113
"You can't have me
anymore, sucka."

14:52.115 --> 14:53.214
Max--

14:53.216 --> 14:54.799
Robbie, it's me.

14:54.801 --> 14:57.969
Classy burp
on your outgoing message.

14:57.971 --> 14:59.287
Max, I--

14:59.289 --> 15:00.338
No.

15:00.340 --> 15:02.223
I need you to come
get your stuff tomorrow.

15:02.225 --> 15:03.842
I don't know how
you've been surviving

15:03.844 --> 15:07.011
without your chin-up bar
and Axe body spray.

15:07.013 --> 15:07.979
Max, hang up.

15:07.981 --> 15:10.431
I already called him.

15:10.433 --> 15:12.484
You called Robbie?

15:12.486 --> 15:13.568
You've done so much for me.

15:13.570 --> 15:15.403
I wanted to do
something for you, too.

15:15.405 --> 15:16.905
So I called Robbie
and I had him come over,

15:16.907 --> 15:18.356
and I gave him his stuff.

15:18.358 --> 15:20.608
Now you won't have to go through
with all that mess.

15:20.610 --> 15:24.312
And I think you'd be pleased,
I really let him have it.

15:24.314 --> 15:27.648
What is with you
and boundaries?

15:27.650 --> 15:29.334
You're in my bed,
you're in my boss' bed,

15:29.336 --> 15:30.785
and now you go and call Robbie?

15:30.787 --> 15:32.587
You're like--
you're like your big-ass horse.

15:32.589 --> 15:34.488
Charging in everywhere
you don't belong.

15:34.490 --> 15:36.657
I thought I was
doing you a favor.

15:36.659 --> 15:39.594
In spite of what you say
about the sounds I heard

15:39.596 --> 15:41.045
coming from your bedroom
the other night,

15:41.047 --> 15:42.680
I know you're upset.

15:42.682 --> 15:46.334
I was masturbating.

15:46.336 --> 15:50.471
I love my job.

15:50.473 --> 15:53.825
I need to see you
outside. Now.

15:53.827 --> 15:55.860
Don't get involved with her.

15:55.862 --> 15:57.845
She takes money
from the homeless.

15:57.847 --> 15:59.898
Not true, Bob's an investor.

15:59.900 --> 16:01.115
Be right back.

16:01.117 --> 16:04.319
Good cupcake, right?

16:07.289 --> 16:08.823
Max, I don't know
how smart that was,

16:08.825 --> 16:11.459
blowing by our only potential
business contact.

16:11.461 --> 16:14.829
You stole my breakup scene.

16:14.831 --> 16:16.714
The only remotely good thing
about breaking up with a guy

16:16.716 --> 16:18.699
is telling him how much better
you are than him

16:18.701 --> 16:20.385
when you give him back
his stuff.

16:20.387 --> 16:22.003
I don't know if you noticed,

16:22.005 --> 16:23.888
but my entertainment budget
is pretty low

16:23.890 --> 16:25.640
and I was really
looking forward to that.

16:25.642 --> 16:28.176
And then you went and stole it.

16:28.178 --> 16:29.727
But I guess
you couldn't help it,

16:29.729 --> 16:32.530
'cause that's what you channings
do, you steal things.

16:33.715 --> 16:35.233
Huh.

16:35.235 --> 16:36.651
Interesting.

16:36.653 --> 16:39.487
Okay, you wanted
a breakup scene?

16:39.489 --> 16:40.688
You're in one.

16:40.690 --> 16:42.023
I'm breaking up with you.

16:42.025 --> 16:43.224
Oh, okay.

16:43.226 --> 16:45.693
The cupcake business is over,
the dream is dead.

16:45.695 --> 16:48.729
Oh, I'm sure Nabulangi
will be devastated.

16:48.731 --> 16:51.416
I don't need you
or your cupcakes to survive.

16:51.418 --> 16:52.617
I'll figure something else out.

16:52.619 --> 16:55.420
Because, aside from your
constant Wharton putdowns,

16:55.422 --> 16:56.838
I'm a business genius

16:56.840 --> 16:58.706
and I will always land
on my feet.

16:58.708 --> 17:00.008
Oh, really?

17:00.010 --> 17:02.260
'Cause today you kind of
landed on your front.

17:02.262 --> 17:03.962
We're done.

17:03.964 --> 17:06.247
After work tonight,
I'll get my things and be gone.

17:06.249 --> 17:08.599
Ooh, you gonna load up
your dream-filled wheelie bag

17:08.602 --> 17:11.252
and ride away
on sir muds-a-lot?

17:11.253 --> 17:14.137
Go ahead.
Be as negative as you want.

17:14.140 --> 17:16.242
'Cause you're in charge
of your own future again.

17:16.362 --> 17:19.125
Oh, joke's on you.
I don't have a future.

17:31.823 --> 17:33.090
Max...

17:33.092 --> 17:34.859
Are you up?

17:34.861 --> 17:36.594
No.

17:36.596 --> 17:39.246
Max, are you mad?

17:39.248 --> 17:40.247
Yes.

17:40.249 --> 17:43.033
Are you up and mad?

17:43.035 --> 17:45.503
No and yes.

17:45.505 --> 17:47.955
Oh, your bed's so soft.

17:47.957 --> 17:51.459
That's my boob.

17:51.461 --> 17:54.929
I know I moved out,
but I came back.

17:54.931 --> 17:57.414
I took the rest
of our dead dream money

17:57.416 --> 18:00.434
and bought some cocktails
for myself and some people.

18:00.436 --> 18:02.720
And myself.

18:02.722 --> 18:04.355
Did you bring me back
any of those?

18:04.357 --> 18:06.640
'Cause I can't
listen to this sober.

18:06.642 --> 18:09.059
Max...

18:09.061 --> 18:12.396
I have nothing.

18:12.398 --> 18:15.232
I really need
the cupcake business.

18:15.234 --> 18:18.435
I can be different.

18:18.437 --> 18:19.687
No, you can't.

18:19.689 --> 18:22.573
No, I can't.

18:22.575 --> 18:26.160
But I can be better.

18:26.162 --> 18:27.611
Please?

18:27.613 --> 18:30.381
Please, let's do this.

18:30.383 --> 18:32.583
I know you have
a fear of success.

18:32.585 --> 18:36.286
You do, because no one
ever believed in your dreams.

18:36.288 --> 18:39.957
But I believe in your dreams.

18:39.959 --> 18:41.976
We have a dream.

18:41.978 --> 18:44.461
God, you are so drunk.

18:44.463 --> 18:48.399
So you probably
won't even remember this.

18:48.401 --> 18:53.204
I'm sorry I said that stuff
about your father.

18:53.206 --> 18:54.905
Did you hear me?

18:54.907 --> 18:58.642
Max, are you up?

18:58.644 --> 19:04.582
Hey, do you have any more
of those poor people chips?

19:04.584 --> 19:08.819
What's up, hangover three?

19:08.821 --> 19:10.087
Why are these up?

19:10.089 --> 19:13.591
I thought we were vampires.

19:13.593 --> 19:16.710
Here, I took the rest
of last night's cupcake money,

19:16.712 --> 19:20.648
and brought you a coffee
and a fresh juice.

19:20.650 --> 19:22.883
Which means that,
after two days in business,

19:22.885 --> 19:26.303
we are $23 down
from where we were.

19:26.305 --> 19:29.890
So we're still building
our cupcake business?

19:29.892 --> 19:31.108
Sure.

19:31.110 --> 19:33.110
All we need is how much?

19:33.112 --> 19:35.646
$250,000.

19:35.648 --> 19:38.616
Which is awesome.

19:38.618 --> 19:41.902
Max, I'm sorry
I crossed all those boundaries.

19:41.904 --> 19:43.120
It's cool.

19:43.122 --> 19:45.072
Me and drunk Caroline
worked it all out.

19:45.074 --> 19:47.074
In fact...

19:47.076 --> 19:52.046
She signed this paper.

19:52.048 --> 19:55.983
"I, drunk Caroline,
am a..."

19:55.985 --> 19:57.801
What's that word?

19:57.803 --> 20:00.804
Punk ass ho.

20:00.806 --> 20:02.256
Thanks.

20:02.258 --> 20:05.809
"I, drunk Caroline,
am a punk ass ho.

20:05.811 --> 20:08.312
"I promise to keep
my big mouth shut,

20:08.314 --> 20:11.232
"and replace all
of Max's poor people chips.

20:11.234 --> 20:17.220
I will no longer meddle
in her relation-chips."

20:17.222 --> 20:20.574

20:20.576 --> 20:21.859

20:21.861 --> 20:25.112

20:28.399 --> 20:31.234
God!

20:31.236 --> 20:33.587

that we have a horse.

20:33.589 --> 20:35.089

20:35.091 --> 20:37.319

20:40.046 --> 20:41.089
Chestnut.

20:46.417 --> 20:47.518

20:47.520 --> 20:49.304
