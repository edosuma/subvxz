<i>Previously on
"Once Upon a Time"...</i>

00:02.257 --> 00:05.225
So, your little science
experiment can really tell us

00:05.250 --> 00:06.731
why the Evil Queen is still alive

00:06.756 --> 00:07.989
and how to destroy her?

00:08.013 --> 00:11.516
I just want things to be normal someday.

00:11.623 --> 00:13.190
I liked teaching.

00:13.224 --> 00:17.861
Information. That's
a tall order to fill...

00:17.896 --> 00:20.130
from inside this cell.

00:20.165 --> 00:21.398
In that case...

00:21.433 --> 00:22.800
let's take a walk.

00:22.834 --> 00:24.169
Belle: Oh, I'll go back...

00:24.194 --> 00:26.796
but, uh, I'm not making a home with you.

Evil Queen: Wow.

01:16.839 --> 01:20.175
Look who cleans up nice.

01:20.919 --> 01:22.292
I like it.

01:22.794 --> 01:24.027
Highlights your eyes.

01:25.027 --> 01:26.163
We're closed.

01:26.603 --> 01:30.039
Oh, for me, I think
you'll make an exception.

01:31.283 --> 01:32.603
Why the change?

01:32.923 --> 01:35.633
That would be my business.

01:35.658 --> 01:38.660
Hyde: Changing your
appearance can't help you.

01:38.756 --> 01:41.554
Oh, you can change the outside,

01:41.997 --> 01:44.648
but what's inside is still there.

01:44.682 --> 01:46.468
Get out, both of you.

01:46.493 --> 01:47.636
In due time.

01:47.661 --> 01:51.340
I'm looking for something I
believe that you have here,

01:51.365 --> 01:54.734
an old cameo necklace.

01:56.112 --> 01:57.778
I know the one.

01:57.803 --> 01:59.838
Give it to me.

02:00.346 --> 02:02.280
And what will you be
giving me in return?

02:03.192 --> 02:04.372
Nothing.

02:05.937 --> 02:07.542
- I will.

[Evil Queen laughs]

02:18.917 --> 02:21.919
[Laughter]

02:23.053 --> 02:24.521
Why won't he die?

02:24.556 --> 02:26.924
Because you can't kill him,

02:26.958 --> 02:29.016
just like Regina couldn't kill me.

02:29.299 --> 02:30.274
And now he knows it,

02:30.299 --> 02:34.335
so unless you want to spend the
rest of your days choking him...

02:44.275 --> 02:46.243
About that necklace.

02:51.416 --> 02:53.517
There it is.

02:57.751 --> 02:59.556
It has great meaning to me.

02:59.591 --> 03:01.212
And now it belongs to me.

03:01.237 --> 03:02.738
Not anymore.

03:03.120 --> 03:05.796
I'm taking it, and you're letting me

03:05.830 --> 03:10.051
because that's how our deal works.

03:10.076 --> 03:12.110
You won't stop me.

03:14.372 --> 03:16.273
These stories...

03:16.739 --> 03:19.443
they're going to play themselves out,

03:19.741 --> 03:21.701
whether you like it or not.

03:21.726 --> 03:25.095
Uh, and I sense you may not.

03:26.141 --> 03:28.218
What's he talking about?

03:28.455 --> 03:30.523
If it's Belle, you
promised not to touch her.

03:31.737 --> 03:33.041
Oh, right.

03:34.292 --> 03:36.827
I won't hurt the bookworm.

03:37.971 --> 03:39.238
We have a deal.

03:40.940 --> 03:42.833
But we don't.

David: Here you go.

04:08.359 --> 04:09.393
More pancakes.

04:09.427 --> 04:12.101
Usually, I'm lucky to get
a lukewarm cup of coffee

04:12.126 --> 04:12.960
on your way to work.

04:12.985 --> 04:14.374
Can't a father cook for his daughter?

04:14.399 --> 04:16.557
Sure, but I'm the Savior,

04:16.582 --> 04:18.315
not a Romanian power lifter.

04:18.339 --> 04:20.137
Enjoy the breakfast.

04:21.086 --> 04:22.530
This is about Hook.

04:22.555 --> 04:23.245
No.

04:23.300 --> 04:24.233
David.

04:25.674 --> 04:27.678
Fine. It's about Hook.

04:28.913 --> 04:30.831
With him moving in, things
are gonna be different.

04:30.856 --> 04:32.315
We're not gonna see you as much.

04:32.350 --> 04:34.384
Killian being here is not
gonna change anything.

04:34.419 --> 04:36.286
You can come cook me
breakfast whenever you want.

04:36.928 --> 04:37.803
These leftovers, however,

04:37.828 --> 04:40.524
will probably last the next month or so.

04:40.558 --> 04:41.358
This is good.

04:41.392 --> 04:43.293
Things are getting back to normal.

04:43.327 --> 04:45.062
You ready for your first
day back at school, Grandma?

04:45.096 --> 04:46.129
You know it.

04:47.899 --> 04:49.582
Oh, this can't be good.

04:49.607 --> 04:50.426
We need to talk.

04:50.451 --> 04:51.852
Whatever this is, we'll take care of it.

04:51.890 --> 04:53.257
You and Henry get to school.

04:53.292 --> 04:55.034
Remember... back to normal.

04:56.206 --> 04:56.783
Emma: What's wrong?

04:56.807 --> 04:58.609
Shouldn't you be in the
lab, working on the potion?

04:58.634 --> 05:00.164
Technically, it's a serum.

05:00.198 --> 05:02.226
And I'm afraid there's
been a complication.

05:02.284 --> 05:04.385
It's Hyde. He's escaped.

05:05.185 --> 05:06.764
I was at the lab until early morning.

05:06.789 --> 05:09.157
When I returned to my room at Granny's,

05:09.474 --> 05:10.608
I found this.

05:12.446 --> 05:14.976
It belonged to a woman
I cared deeply for.

05:15.001 --> 05:15.767
Hyde knew.

05:15.792 --> 05:17.640
He's trying to taunt me with it.

05:17.665 --> 05:19.460
We need to get you back to the lab.

05:19.485 --> 05:23.421
Now we don't just need the
serum to defeat the Evil Queen.

05:23.446 --> 05:25.447
We need it to finish Hyde.

05:29.428 --> 05:32.430
[Bell chiming]

05:34.099 --> 05:36.033
[Door opens, closes]

05:37.763 --> 05:39.664
Thank you for arranging this, Mary.

05:39.689 --> 05:42.996
I-I can't tell you how
much it means to me.

05:43.021 --> 05:44.643
There's no need to be nervous.

05:44.668 --> 05:46.405
Father is going to love your work.

05:46.430 --> 05:47.647
[Door opens]

05:47.656 --> 05:49.522
Dr. Lydgate: Mary, there you are.

05:50.062 --> 05:51.209
Hello, darling.

05:51.234 --> 05:52.468
Father.

05:53.102 --> 05:54.135
Dr. Jekyll.

05:54.272 --> 05:55.852
Now, what's so important
I had to be pulled away

05:55.877 --> 05:57.912
from Scotch and cards at the academy?

05:57.946 --> 06:00.881
Ah. Allow me to show
you. Right over here.

06:03.638 --> 06:07.339
This serum, once
perfected, will be capable

06:07.364 --> 06:10.415
of separating a man's personality in two

06:10.447 --> 06:13.863
and dividing the higher, more
noble aspects of his nature

06:13.888 --> 06:17.123
from the primitive beast
of which every man is born.

06:17.820 --> 06:18.840
Intriguing.

06:18.918 --> 06:23.261
Imagine if man were in
control of the beast within,

06:23.286 --> 06:24.940
rather than slave to it.

06:24.965 --> 06:27.281
How can you be certain your
serum wouldn't make things worse?

06:27.306 --> 06:29.574
It can't get any worse
for Henry's patients.

06:29.810 --> 06:31.110
They have no hope at all.

06:31.135 --> 06:33.517
Dr. Lydgate, if I had
the Scientific Academy

06:33.542 --> 06:34.323
behind my work...

06:34.348 --> 06:35.753
So that's what this is about.

06:36.693 --> 06:39.195
You want me to grant you
membership to the Academy.

06:40.151 --> 06:41.652
Well...

06:41.811 --> 06:44.379
I'm afraid I can't offer it.

06:45.905 --> 06:47.906
Your work is dangerous.

06:48.606 --> 06:50.128
Good evening, Dr. Jekyll.

06:50.153 --> 06:51.286
Come, Mary.

06:53.438 --> 06:55.339
I'm sorry, Henry.

06:55.500 --> 06:57.033
[Door opens]

[Liquid bubbling]

07:00.738 --> 07:02.156
[Door closes]

07:06.518 --> 07:10.454
Looks like someone's lost
control of their inner beast.

07:11.335 --> 07:13.565
- Who are you? How did you get in here?
- [Laughs]

07:13.590 --> 07:15.557
Doesn't matter, dearie.

07:15.733 --> 07:19.889
But what does is that
unlike that blowhard Lydgate,

07:19.914 --> 07:22.648
I am here to help you.

07:23.104 --> 07:24.829
I-I don't even know you.

07:24.854 --> 07:25.917
Why would you help me?

07:25.942 --> 07:30.492
Well, let's just say I have a
vested interest in your work.

07:30.547 --> 07:34.250
Now, do you want to get
into that club or not?

07:35.573 --> 07:36.711
How?

07:36.828 --> 07:38.378
Have you ever stopped to consider

07:38.403 --> 07:41.372
what you think of as
weakness is really...

07:41.808 --> 07:42.642
strength?

07:42.988 --> 07:45.416
Perhaps using that serum to get in touch

07:45.440 --> 07:49.310
with your deepest desires
is exactly what you need.

07:50.420 --> 07:53.055
Even if you were right,

07:53.236 --> 07:54.536
the serum isn't finished.

07:54.561 --> 07:58.364
I-I can't get the active
particles to suspend in...

07:59.353 --> 08:00.554
[Giggles]

08:01.490 --> 08:04.005
All science needs is a little magic.

08:04.030 --> 08:05.343
Congratulations, dearie.

08:05.368 --> 08:07.259
You're a genius. [Giggles]

08:07.284 --> 08:12.254
Now, if we can just get that
pwetty young friend of yours

08:13.244 --> 08:15.445
to finally notice you.

08:16.470 --> 08:17.401
You mean Mary?

08:17.426 --> 08:20.495
Ooh, she's right within your grasp.

08:20.628 --> 08:22.162
The question is,

08:22.196 --> 08:26.433
how far are you willing
to go to get what you want?

08:29.496 --> 08:31.063
[Giggles]

08:32.356 --> 08:33.389
[Giggles]

08:36.510 --> 08:37.544
[Groaning]

08:38.010 --> 08:39.279
Ahh!

08:39.313 --> 08:44.116
[Screaming]

08:44.992 --> 08:48.382
- That's everything.
- What, one chest?

08:48.907 --> 08:50.948
Well, I guess there won't be many fights

08:50.973 --> 08:52.675
over closet space with Emma?

08:52.700 --> 08:55.968
Well, the seafaring life doesn't
call much for possessions.

08:56.401 --> 08:58.769
Speaking of, I have
something to give you

08:58.794 --> 08:59.694
'cause I'm leaving.

08:59.743 --> 09:00.867
What is it?

09:01.727 --> 09:03.550
It's a bit of mermaid magic.

09:03.575 --> 09:05.403
It's how they stay in
touch beneath the sea.

09:06.083 --> 09:07.540
If you're in trouble, call into that,

09:07.565 --> 09:10.100
and I will hear you using this.

09:10.125 --> 09:11.492
They're connected.

09:12.009 --> 09:13.226
How clever.

09:13.251 --> 09:14.201
Thank you, Killian.

09:14.226 --> 09:16.995
And I thought the captain
always went down with his ship.

09:17.521 --> 09:18.194
Crocodile.

09:18.219 --> 09:19.515
No. Hey, hey.

09:19.540 --> 09:20.674
It's okay.

09:21.689 --> 09:23.156
Why are you here?

09:23.190 --> 09:25.568
To protect you...
to protect you both.

09:25.593 --> 09:27.828
The only one we need
protection from is you.

09:27.853 --> 09:29.587
Well, I'm afraid that's not the case.

09:29.612 --> 09:31.262
Hyde has escaped.

09:31.762 --> 09:35.103
And since he wants to use
you as leverage against me,

09:35.128 --> 09:37.096
I have to make sure
he can't do that again.

09:37.155 --> 09:39.823
Why would Hyde care anything about me?

09:39.848 --> 09:41.749
What did you do to him?

09:43.408 --> 09:45.171
Of course. Why would you tell me?

09:45.196 --> 09:46.874
You know what? I don't care.

09:46.899 --> 09:48.559
I've got friends who can protect me.

09:48.584 --> 09:51.519
- You... you can just go.
- You heard the lass.

09:52.156 --> 09:53.880
If you want me to go, fine.

09:53.905 --> 09:55.305
But first...

09:55.330 --> 09:56.964
[Whoosh]

09:59.330 --> 10:00.829
What the devil did you do?

10:00.854 --> 10:03.844
Cast a protection spell on
this barnacle-encrusted heap,

10:03.869 --> 10:07.305
one which will prevent Hyde
from coming aboard to hurt you...

10:07.407 --> 10:09.775
and also make it
impossible for you to leave.

10:10.834 --> 10:12.445
No, no.

10:12.479 --> 10:14.447
- [Whoosh]
- [Whimpers]

10:14.481 --> 10:15.948
H-H-How dare you?!

10:15.983 --> 10:17.389
You can't just lock me in a case

10:17.414 --> 10:19.415
like one of... one of your objects!

10:19.892 --> 10:21.620
Apparently, I can.

10:22.267 --> 10:24.955
One day, you'll thank me for it.

10:24.980 --> 10:27.048
[Scoffs]

10:30.080 --> 10:31.660
It's good to have you back, Grandma.

10:31.685 --> 10:33.061
It's like I never left.

10:33.498 --> 10:35.515
Morning, Henry.

10:36.770 --> 10:37.699
That's different.

10:37.724 --> 10:38.952
I hope you have a good day.

10:38.987 --> 10:40.187
You, too. [Chuckles]

10:40.372 --> 10:42.022
- Oh, I am s...
- Ohh. Ohh, I'm so sorry.

10:42.056 --> 10:43.403
- Oh, no, it's fine.
- [Chuckles]

10:43.436 --> 10:45.806
I just, um... I
think I'm lost.

10:46.169 --> 10:47.680
Do you know where room 20 is?

10:47.705 --> 10:49.863
I do. That's <i>my</i> classroom.

10:50.234 --> 10:51.623
I'm your new teacher's aid.

10:51.648 --> 10:52.525
My name is Shirin.

10:52.550 --> 10:54.021
Oh, from the Land of Untold Stories,

10:54.046 --> 10:55.012
like the students.

10:55.273 --> 10:57.328
It's very nice to meet
you, Shirin. I'm Snow.

10:57.709 --> 10:59.788
As in Snow White, the princess?

10:59.813 --> 11:02.552
What's a princess like you
doing working here as a teacher?

11:02.577 --> 11:04.286
[Chuckles] It's complicated.

11:04.311 --> 11:05.191
I don't know how much you know

11:05.216 --> 11:06.817
about the curse that
created Storybrooke?

11:06.876 --> 11:08.102
Very little, I'm afraid.

11:08.127 --> 11:09.627
Well, the short version is,

11:10.324 --> 11:11.830
I didn't always know I was a princess.

11:11.855 --> 11:14.197
I mean, I did, and then I didn't.

11:14.222 --> 11:15.850
And, well, then I did again.

11:15.875 --> 11:18.076
But when I didn't, I was a teacher.

11:18.632 --> 11:20.074
And even though the curse is long gone,

11:20.099 --> 11:22.826
I realized... I really loved teaching.

11:22.910 --> 11:24.277
That's very admirable.

11:24.741 --> 11:26.735
But I supposed I shouldn't be surprised.

11:26.760 --> 11:27.803
You're Snow White.

11:27.828 --> 11:29.103
Your reputation precedes you.

11:29.128 --> 11:30.762
- [Bell rings]
- Oh, yes, it does.

11:30.787 --> 11:32.047
Let's get started.

11:32.072 --> 11:34.441
Uh, have you ever built a birdhouse?

11:35.710 --> 11:36.816
Emma: I'm at the lab.

11:36.841 --> 11:38.876
I'll let you know as
soon as we get to Hyde.

11:38.901 --> 11:41.024
Bye. Guys, that was Hook.

11:41.049 --> 11:43.416
Gold trapped Belle on the <i>Jolly Roger</i>
with some kind of protection spell.

11:43.441 --> 11:44.911
He thinks Hyde's coming after her.

11:44.936 --> 11:46.163
The Dark One's wife?

11:46.348 --> 11:47.562
I thought she was
under a sleeping curse.

11:47.587 --> 11:50.585
It's always out of one
prison, into another with her.

11:50.619 --> 11:51.686
I don't get it.

11:51.720 --> 11:53.921
Why would Hyde go after <i>her?</i>

11:54.534 --> 11:56.756
We need to speed this up.
Are you close with the serum?

11:56.781 --> 11:58.333
I'm afraid I've hit a bit of an impasse.

11:58.358 --> 11:59.286
[Chuckles nervously]

11:59.311 --> 12:00.567
All right. What about Gold?

12:00.711 --> 12:02.005
You think he'd be willing to help us?

12:02.030 --> 12:03.814
Emma: You told us he helped
you finish the original serum,

12:03.839 --> 12:06.150
and he wants Hyde gone
just as much as we do.

12:06.175 --> 12:07.447
Regina, you think you could talk to him?

12:07.472 --> 12:08.505
Yeah, I can talk to him.

12:08.583 --> 12:10.644
Dad and I will track down
the Evil Queen and Hyde.

12:10.669 --> 12:11.915
Call us when the serum's ready.

12:11.940 --> 12:14.207
Leroy, you and Doc keep
an eye on things here.

12:14.232 --> 12:15.057
Leroy: Yeah, don't worry, brother.

12:15.082 --> 12:17.651
We've been keeping an eye on
things since the day we hatched.

12:18.711 --> 12:19.533
Wonderful.

12:19.558 --> 12:21.523
I-I was hoping someone
would make a run to Granny's

12:21.548 --> 12:23.110
for a mutton sandwich.

12:23.260 --> 12:25.999
And, uh, extra pickles.

12:26.095 --> 12:28.229
Dwarfs aren't errand boys.

12:28.875 --> 12:30.164
It helps me think.

12:31.630 --> 12:32.496
It better,

12:33.376 --> 12:36.811
or you're gonna see <i>my</i> dark side.

12:40.068 --> 12:42.343
[Horse neighs]

12:42.368 --> 12:43.368
[Door creaks]

12:43.393 --> 12:46.161
[Classical music playing]

12:47.302 --> 12:50.270
Rumplestiltskin: Are you
ready for your debut?

12:50.305 --> 12:52.973
I don't feel like the same man.

12:56.536 --> 13:00.047
I-I don't look like him, either.

13:00.081 --> 13:02.382
Because you're not the same man.

13:02.417 --> 13:05.052
In fact, you're not
a man at all, really.

13:05.086 --> 13:07.421
You're <i>parts of a man...</i>

13:07.701 --> 13:09.456
the parts, scars and all,

13:09.481 --> 13:11.915
that Jekyll wanted to
hide from the world.

13:12.052 --> 13:13.280
[Chuckles] As a
matter of fact, may...

13:13.305 --> 13:16.548
maybe that's what you should
call yourself... "Mr. Hyde."

13:17.499 --> 13:20.534
[Music continues]

13:23.171 --> 13:28.242
[Indistinct conversations]

13:38.704 --> 13:41.506
Dr. Lydgate.

13:41.807 --> 13:43.791
I'm sorry, but have we met?

13:43.816 --> 13:46.908
No. I'm here on behalf
of a mutual friend...

13:46.933 --> 13:47.800
Dr. Jekyll.

13:47.825 --> 13:49.826
I'm Mr. Hyde.

13:50.059 --> 13:51.726
Mary: Hyde?

13:51.988 --> 13:54.106
I don't believe Henry's
ever mentioned you.

13:54.188 --> 13:55.221
Hasn't he?

13:55.497 --> 13:58.203
He's certainly mentioned
you, and for good reason.

13:58.228 --> 14:00.329
You must be Mary.

14:01.400 --> 14:02.237
Why, yes.

14:02.271 --> 14:03.761
[Smooches]

14:03.786 --> 14:04.688
Mary, why don't you go

14:04.713 --> 14:07.756
and get our, uh,
uninvited guest a drink?

14:07.781 --> 14:09.348
Of course, Father.

14:12.087 --> 14:15.024
If this is about Dr. Jekyll's
membership in the Academy,

14:15.049 --> 14:16.303
I've already told him no.

14:16.328 --> 14:19.581
If he thinks sending some... ruffian

14:19.606 --> 14:20.756
will change my mind...

14:20.781 --> 14:23.816
That's <i>exactly</i>
<i>what he thinks, Doctor.</i>

14:23.903 --> 14:25.926
You see, he told me the story

14:25.951 --> 14:28.202
of you and your new lab assistant.

14:28.227 --> 14:30.179
That's her over there, isn't it?

14:30.819 --> 14:31.855
She's pretty.

14:31.880 --> 14:33.243
She's young enough to be your daughter.

14:33.268 --> 14:37.288
Now, that's a story I imagine
you'd like to keep hidden,

14:37.322 --> 14:39.479
but I'm sure Mrs. Lydgate

14:39.504 --> 14:42.329
would be very interested
in hearing it...

14:42.876 --> 14:44.272
or Mary, for that matter.

14:44.297 --> 14:47.298
Look, here comes Mary now.

14:50.702 --> 14:51.769
[Door opens]

14:51.803 --> 14:53.037
[Liquid bubbling]

14:55.167 --> 14:56.203
Excellent.

14:56.228 --> 14:58.616
Now, unless you need a
back rub or a foot massage,

14:58.641 --> 15:00.442
can I get to doing what dwarfs do best?

15:00.538 --> 15:01.307
Which is...?

15:01.332 --> 15:04.684
We're the kingdom's
guards, its protectors,

15:04.950 --> 15:07.651
the might wall between chaos and calm.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.628
Evil Queen: Excellent...

15:10.185 --> 15:13.588
because chaos is here.

15:14.117 --> 15:15.960
It's the Queen!

15:16.494 --> 15:18.347
You miss me?

15:18.372 --> 15:19.840
All right, sister.

15:20.970 --> 15:22.455
Let's dance!

15:22.480 --> 15:24.114
[Whoosh]

15:26.901 --> 15:28.190
No, no, no.

15:28.215 --> 15:30.003
H-How did you find me?

15:30.038 --> 15:32.573
Oh, you led us right to you...

15:33.714 --> 15:34.808
with this.

15:34.843 --> 15:40.013
You see, my new friend cast
a beckoning spell on it.

15:42.217 --> 15:46.649
So now, my lesser half,
shall we see what I,

15:46.674 --> 15:49.306
the monster you made...

15:49.471 --> 15:51.412
can really do?

15:53.119 --> 15:55.878
- [Bell rings]
- Okay, so, for our first lesson,

15:55.903 --> 15:57.427
I thought we would jump right in.

15:58.130 --> 16:01.923
Newton's Third Law of Motion
states that for every action,

16:01.948 --> 16:05.545
there is an opposite but equal reaction.

16:05.836 --> 16:08.104
Who wants to come up
here and solve for "X"?

16:12.759 --> 16:15.746
Come on. There must be one of you
brave enough to give this a try.

16:25.672 --> 16:27.261
[Door opens, bell jingles]

16:27.286 --> 16:28.034
[Footsteps approach]

16:28.068 --> 16:29.836
[Bell jingles]

16:29.870 --> 16:31.571
Regina: Well.

16:31.826 --> 16:34.007
I like it. Highlights your eyes.

16:34.685 --> 16:36.127
Well, thank you very much.

16:36.152 --> 16:37.632
Decided to do a spot of shopping

16:37.657 --> 16:39.291
now you've lopped off your dark side?

16:39.419 --> 16:41.294
I take it you've seen my other half.

16:41.319 --> 16:42.528
And luckily for you,

16:42.958 --> 16:45.595
I wasn't interested in
what she was offering.

16:45.620 --> 16:47.518
Resisting the darkness?

16:47.543 --> 16:48.948
This <i>is</i> a new you.

16:49.089 --> 16:51.024
Is there something you want?

16:51.058 --> 16:54.725
Jekyll has a head start
on you with a new serum,

16:54.750 --> 16:57.785
one that can destroy
Hyde for good this time.

16:58.848 --> 17:01.316
He just needs your help.

17:04.939 --> 17:08.074
[Clock ticking]

17:08.390 --> 17:09.612
Rise and shine!

17:09.637 --> 17:11.304
- [Giggles]
- [Groans]

17:12.313 --> 17:15.386
Well, well, someone had quite the night.

17:15.568 --> 17:17.244
I did? What happened?

17:17.270 --> 17:18.435
Check your pockets.

17:21.622 --> 17:22.698
[Chuckles]

17:22.723 --> 17:24.417
[Laughing] An Academy pin?

17:24.450 --> 17:25.584
I did it!

17:25.617 --> 17:26.685
But how?

17:26.719 --> 17:29.421
Well, it seems your other
half can be quite persuasive.

17:29.455 --> 17:32.018
Oh, it really worked! Do
you know what this means?

17:32.043 --> 17:33.314
Everything's going
to be different now...

17:33.339 --> 17:35.240
my... my ideas, my work.

17:35.265 --> 17:37.066
Just one thing missing.

17:38.411 --> 17:39.380
You mean Mary.

17:39.405 --> 17:41.640
You know, that party
was filled with suitors.

17:41.815 --> 17:43.318
You wouldn't want any
of them scooping her up

17:43.343 --> 17:45.944
before you had the chance,
now, would you, hmm?

17:46.189 --> 17:48.357
She doesn't even know how I feel.

17:48.382 --> 17:49.682
Why don't you tell her?

17:50.340 --> 17:51.941
Well, I wouldn't know how.

17:51.966 --> 17:53.734
Just swig some more of that serum

17:53.759 --> 17:55.960
and let Mr. Hyde do the talking for you.

17:56.998 --> 17:58.396
Mr. Hyde?

17:58.731 --> 17:59.959
My other half has a name?

17:59.984 --> 18:00.750
Yes.

18:01.343 --> 18:02.716
He couldn't very well walk around

18:02.741 --> 18:05.143
calling himself Dr.
Jekyll, now, could he?

18:05.478 --> 18:08.458
Wh-Wh-Why do you care
if I end up with Mary?

18:08.488 --> 18:10.335
You still haven't explained
what it is you want.

18:10.360 --> 18:11.961
Well, isn't it obvious?

18:12.071 --> 18:14.139
I'm interested in that serum.

18:14.164 --> 18:16.900
- Why?
- Because I need it!

18:17.670 --> 18:19.404
Now...

18:19.892 --> 18:23.643
one success proves nothing.

18:23.916 --> 18:24.916
Two?

18:25.597 --> 18:28.473
Well, then we'd know
you really had something.

18:29.225 --> 18:31.762
So, what do you say, Dr. Jekyll?

18:32.074 --> 18:35.910
Ready to let Mr. Hyde back out to play?

18:38.394 --> 18:40.493
[Exhales sharply]

18:43.657 --> 18:45.706
Regina: What the hell happened here?

18:45.731 --> 18:48.761
They came for the serum,
smashed everything.

18:48.786 --> 18:51.115
Can't say I'm surprised
that your, uh, stronger half

18:51.140 --> 18:53.141
got the better of you once again.

18:53.166 --> 18:54.700
Pretty much how it goes with you two.

18:54.757 --> 18:58.259
You didn't care about
me or my work, did you?

18:58.286 --> 19:00.027
Or even what you unleashed?

19:00.052 --> 19:01.820
<i>I</i> didn't unleash anything.

19:01.995 --> 19:03.014
<i>You</i> did.

19:03.039 --> 19:04.306
That man out there?

19:04.327 --> 19:05.961
He's not some monster from the deep.

19:05.995 --> 19:07.362
It's you...

19:07.396 --> 19:11.967
except stronger and smarter.

19:12.001 --> 19:12.771
No.

19:12.796 --> 19:15.931
He isn't, not this time,

19:16.172 --> 19:18.607
'cause I had a feeling
Hyde would find us,

19:18.641 --> 19:19.875
so I hid...

19:19.909 --> 19:22.777
a little extra, just in case.

19:23.191 --> 19:24.512
Oh, great!

19:25.648 --> 19:27.115
Let's do this.

19:27.149 --> 19:29.340
- Gold?
- Gold: Hand it over.

19:29.365 --> 19:30.632
It'll only take a moment.

19:31.652 --> 19:32.888
I don't think I'll be...

19:32.922 --> 19:36.291
"handing over" our only weapon.

19:36.325 --> 19:39.027
You can work your
magic from right there.

19:39.909 --> 19:41.796
Very well.

19:44.380 --> 19:45.761
[Gasps]

19:45.786 --> 19:46.872
- [Heart beating]
- What are you doing?

19:46.897 --> 19:50.854
The Evil Queen may not care
about innocent bloodshed,

19:51.207 --> 19:54.117
but we both know that <i>you</i> do.

19:54.438 --> 19:55.957
You <i>did make
a deal with her.</i>

19:55.982 --> 19:59.000
She promised to leave Belle
and my unborn child alone,

19:59.025 --> 20:03.562
which means the only person
the serum is gonna be used on...

20:04.186 --> 20:05.987
is Hyde.

20:09.910 --> 20:11.845
Now, if you wouldn't mind.

20:13.501 --> 20:16.303
[Dagger sizzles]

20:20.287 --> 20:22.855
You'll thank me for this, Regina.

20:23.716 --> 20:26.074
One day, you'll finally realize

20:26.108 --> 20:29.057
you can no more rid
yourself of your darkness

20:29.082 --> 20:30.682
than I can.

20:31.047 --> 20:32.058
Catch.

20:32.083 --> 20:33.372
[Gasps]

20:33.397 --> 20:35.872
[Whoosh]

20:42.842 --> 20:44.677
They don't remember
anything I taught them.

20:46.056 --> 20:47.048
This doesn't make sense.

20:47.073 --> 20:50.067
I'm doing everything
exactly the way I used to.

20:50.216 --> 20:51.817
Perhaps that's the problem.

20:52.337 --> 20:53.938
From what you told me,

20:53.963 --> 20:56.138
you're no longer the
same person anymore.

20:56.287 --> 20:58.279
[Sighs] How do I explain?

20:58.304 --> 21:00.820
Many years ago, the kingdom I come from

21:00.845 --> 21:03.513
came under attack by a powerful menace.

21:03.697 --> 21:07.339
The only one in any position who
could save us was the princess,

21:07.364 --> 21:09.645
but she never fully
embraced who she was,

21:09.670 --> 21:11.370
what a hero she could be.

21:11.631 --> 21:14.232
And as a result, our kingdom was lost.

21:14.257 --> 21:16.065
That's terrible.

21:16.090 --> 21:18.198
I'm so sorry. What kingdom was it?

21:18.230 --> 21:21.464
It's in the past, and
it's no longer important,

21:21.489 --> 21:24.023
except for what can be learned from it.

21:24.670 --> 21:27.512
If you want these children
to reach their potential,

21:27.537 --> 21:29.571
you need to lead by example.

21:29.651 --> 21:31.885
That means asserting your strength

21:32.078 --> 21:34.312
and embracing who you really are...

21:34.337 --> 21:36.292
Snow White.

21:41.163 --> 21:43.198
You sure I can't get you anything?

21:43.232 --> 21:45.332
We could always crack
open a barrel of rum,

21:45.357 --> 21:46.824
if you thought it'd help.

21:46.965 --> 21:48.799
I'm pregnant, remember?

21:49.556 --> 21:50.736
- Oh, yeah.
- [Sighs]

21:50.761 --> 21:52.286
And no, I'm I'm fine.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.779
Jekyll: Hello. I-Is anyone down there?

21:55.452 --> 21:56.682
Oh, you are.

21:56.707 --> 21:58.324
[Sighs] Thank goodness you're here.

21:58.340 --> 21:59.743
And the question is why you're here.

21:59.768 --> 22:01.609
Shouldn't you be in the lab
completing your serum?

22:01.610 --> 22:02.977
Th-That's just it. I did.

22:03.224 --> 22:05.450
And then Hyde found me
and destroyed the lab.

22:05.478 --> 22:08.279
But what happened to the
serum? The Dark One took it.

22:10.228 --> 22:13.387
Apparently, he has some
arrangement with the Evil Queen.

22:15.102 --> 22:16.530
Emma's looking for the Evil Queen.

22:16.555 --> 22:18.395
Go. Go. Emma needs
you. We'll be all right.

22:18.420 --> 22:20.075
We've got Rumple's spell to protect us.

22:20.100 --> 22:21.300
Thank you, Belle.

22:24.533 --> 22:25.933
[Sighs]

22:26.736 --> 22:29.837
So [Chuckles] you're Belle,

22:30.193 --> 22:33.334
the, uh, Dark One's wife.

22:33.359 --> 22:37.205
I'm, uh... I'm sorry for
any harm he's caused you.

22:37.244 --> 22:40.113
I appreciate the sentiment.

22:40.147 --> 22:43.282
Sentiment won't bring back Mary.

22:44.514 --> 22:46.052
Mary?

22:46.086 --> 22:47.812
Is she someone you loved?

22:47.837 --> 22:49.552
With all my heart...

22:50.913 --> 22:54.906
until Hyde destroyed that love.

23:04.828 --> 23:07.062
Hyde: Mary?

23:14.002 --> 23:15.431
Mr. Hyde?

23:15.502 --> 23:16.424
Apologies.

23:16.449 --> 23:19.484
I-I didn't mean to startle you.

23:19.509 --> 23:20.042
[Chuckles]

23:20.067 --> 23:22.441
Hyde, what are you doing here?

23:24.621 --> 23:27.356
Might I talk with you for a bit?

23:28.131 --> 23:29.725
You may.

23:31.511 --> 23:32.378
I must confess,

23:32.403 --> 23:35.605
you... left me quite
curious the other night.

23:35.787 --> 23:38.488
I wonder why Henry's
never mentioned you.

23:38.601 --> 23:40.036
Have you known each other long?

23:40.061 --> 23:42.295
Oh, it feels like a lifetime.

23:42.334 --> 23:44.836
But I didn't come here
to go on about myself.

23:44.870 --> 23:47.872
Actually, I'm here on Jekyll's behalf.

23:50.684 --> 23:53.144
The doctor has great feelings for you.

23:56.496 --> 23:59.550
I care very much for Henry.

24:00.715 --> 24:03.327
But I don't think I could ever...

24:03.352 --> 24:05.720
be with him in that way.

24:09.820 --> 24:11.496
Why not?

24:11.530 --> 24:13.931
Look at his work.

24:13.966 --> 24:15.225
Things like...

24:15.250 --> 24:17.537
passion and desire

24:17.562 --> 24:21.532
are little more than...
contaminants to be eliminated.

24:22.217 --> 24:25.703
I need someone who wants
to bathe in their passion

24:25.801 --> 24:28.937
and give in to desire.

24:30.603 --> 24:33.546
I have a feeling you understand me,

24:33.571 --> 24:35.772
don't you, Mr. Hyde?

24:37.115 --> 24:39.239
What makes you think that?

24:41.212 --> 24:44.359
When you walked into the
parlor the other night,

24:44.384 --> 24:47.366
I saw the way the others looked at you.

24:47.648 --> 24:51.484
They were afraid, but I wasn't.

24:52.141 --> 24:55.218
I saw a man unencumbered by...

24:55.243 --> 24:58.245
fear or by social obligation.

24:58.270 --> 25:00.641
How... how do you do that?

25:01.191 --> 25:03.660
How are you so free of it all?

25:07.073 --> 25:08.617
I don't know.

25:11.483 --> 25:14.017
Perhaps I was simply...

25:14.538 --> 25:16.538
made that way.

25:40.624 --> 25:42.961
David: You know what my
secret for the pancakes is?

25:43.052 --> 25:43.819
Nutmeg.

25:44.032 --> 25:45.421
Now you can make them for Hook.

25:45.446 --> 25:48.164
Emma: Dad, are you sure
you're okay with me and Hook?

25:48.189 --> 25:51.324
Even as much as I hated that
pirate when I first met him,

25:51.777 --> 25:54.179
if you're happy, so am I.

25:54.776 --> 25:55.877
What?

25:55.902 --> 25:57.268
Someone's here.

25:57.293 --> 25:59.794
Indeed! You found me.

26:00.541 --> 26:03.176
Oh, did you really think I would
let you defeat me with that again?

26:05.531 --> 26:07.032
[Grunting]

26:07.066 --> 26:08.433
- [Whoosh]
- Dad!

26:08.468 --> 26:09.668
[Groaning]

26:09.702 --> 26:11.536
Are you okay? Dad?

26:13.361 --> 26:15.130
[Groans]

26:20.046 --> 26:21.146
[Gasps]

26:21.643 --> 26:22.633
So, tell me...

26:22.658 --> 26:23.448
[Gasps]

26:23.483 --> 26:26.318
was this how you imagined
your story playing out?

26:26.352 --> 26:27.352
[Gasps]

26:27.788 --> 26:29.756
Actually, yes.

26:30.423 --> 26:31.723
It is.

26:31.758 --> 26:37.462
Quite a [Grunts] twist, don't you think?

26:37.497 --> 26:38.754
Huh.

26:38.779 --> 26:40.633
Oh, Jekyll always tries
to get the better of me,

26:40.658 --> 26:42.064
but he never can.

26:42.089 --> 26:44.124
Do you know why?

26:44.142 --> 26:47.445
It's because he's all mind, no heart,

26:47.479 --> 26:52.016
which makes him a very dull
and predictable boy, indeed.

26:54.439 --> 26:56.086
You switched vials.

26:56.121 --> 26:59.223
Well, I couldn't very well
let you have it, now, could I?

27:00.901 --> 27:01.959
What is it you want?

27:01.993 --> 27:04.895
Oh, I think you know the answer to that.

27:05.477 --> 27:09.500
I want to show you the end of our story,

27:09.534 --> 27:11.802
and I want to watch you suffer.

27:11.837 --> 27:13.971
Now...

27:15.055 --> 27:17.775
take us to Belle.

27:25.218 --> 27:27.599
Now, you're probably wondering
what we're doing outside.

27:28.279 --> 27:32.333
These... are your
assignments from earlier.

27:34.015 --> 27:35.725
Follow me.

27:38.385 --> 27:42.194
Newton's Third Law every action...

27:42.452 --> 27:44.553
has a reaction.

27:47.037 --> 27:48.170
This...

27:49.132 --> 27:50.310
is the action.

27:51.049 --> 27:52.302
And this...

27:52.327 --> 27:54.028
[Students gasp]

27:54.142 --> 27:57.148
is the equal and opposite reaction.

27:57.800 --> 27:59.667
Now, who wants to give it a try?

28:07.622 --> 28:09.863
Hyde: Ah, here we are.

28:11.308 --> 28:14.003
Whatever you're planning, stop.

28:14.020 --> 28:16.302
You might control that dagger
now, but you won't always.

28:16.327 --> 28:18.568
And I promise you,
if you harm Belle...

28:18.593 --> 28:20.041
You don't need to worry.

28:20.066 --> 28:21.636
I won't harm Belle.

28:21.661 --> 28:24.390
You see, there's one final twist.

28:24.415 --> 28:28.685
I am not the monster
you need to worry about.

28:30.737 --> 28:33.672
[Birds chirping]

28:33.707 --> 28:37.843
[Hoofbeats, horse neighs]

28:49.162 --> 28:50.329
Mary?

28:50.364 --> 28:51.597
Henry!

28:54.006 --> 28:55.525
How did you get in here?

28:55.550 --> 28:57.145
[Breathing heavily]

28:57.170 --> 28:59.171
Where's Hyde? Wh-What's going on?

28:59.821 --> 29:03.287
I sent him last night to talk to you.

29:03.312 --> 29:04.878
You brought him <i>here?</i>

29:04.903 --> 29:06.704
That is none of your business.

29:07.437 --> 29:08.624
And I asked you a question.

29:08.649 --> 29:11.284
Where is Hyde? Have you hurt him?

29:11.309 --> 29:12.709
Have I hurt him?!

29:12.734 --> 29:14.521
I <i>am</i> him!

29:16.323 --> 29:18.647
The serum. [Gasps]

29:18.672 --> 29:19.477
You took it.

29:19.502 --> 29:20.813
This wasn't supposed to happen.

29:20.838 --> 29:23.473
You were supposed to love me, not him.

29:23.746 --> 29:25.447
I will never love you.

29:25.677 --> 29:28.602
You're weak, and you're completely mad!

29:28.627 --> 29:29.993
Mary. Mary!

29:30.018 --> 29:30.759
Get off.

29:30.784 --> 29:31.956
- Mary, no.
- Let me go!

29:31.981 --> 29:34.636
- Mary, I did it for you!
- [Crying] No, no.

29:34.758 --> 29:36.483
- You. You.
- Please let me go.

29:36.508 --> 29:38.903
Why couldn't you see that?!

29:38.928 --> 29:41.723
[Screams]

29:45.775 --> 29:49.428
Oh, my word, it's the doctor's daughter!

29:49.453 --> 29:51.198
Man: Someone must've pushed her!

29:51.223 --> 29:52.356
Up there!

29:58.508 --> 30:02.043
[Sobbing]

30:04.847 --> 30:06.702
[Grunts]

30:06.727 --> 30:08.194
Ahh!

30:08.518 --> 30:12.687
[Groaning]

30:28.789 --> 30:30.456
[Knock on door]

30:30.705 --> 30:33.873
Dr. Lydgate: Mary!
Mary, is everything okay?

30:33.898 --> 30:35.665
We're coming in.

30:37.591 --> 30:40.627
[Grunts]

30:40.755 --> 30:43.790
[Tea kettle whistling]

30:46.857 --> 30:49.192
Whatever happened...

30:49.539 --> 30:54.710
whatever Hyde did to
Mary, I'm, uh, sorry.

30:56.810 --> 30:59.622
If only she'd been strong
enough to resist Hyde,

30:59.647 --> 31:01.181
she would be mine.

31:05.792 --> 31:07.927
Yours?

31:09.043 --> 31:11.478
I mean, we'd... we'd...
we'd... we'd... be together.

31:14.039 --> 31:15.813
Yeah.

31:15.838 --> 31:18.490
Oh, let me... let me
get some sugar for you.

31:30.854 --> 31:32.700
- [Gasps]
- Whoops.

31:32.755 --> 31:35.991
You weren't getting the sugar.

31:36.025 --> 31:37.826
Killian, help!

31:42.064 --> 31:44.566
Ahh!

31:44.600 --> 31:46.635
[Exhales sharply]

31:48.000 --> 31:50.902
[Grunts]

31:54.877 --> 31:56.472
Belle!

31:56.497 --> 31:58.398
[Gasps]

31:58.423 --> 32:00.391
[Grunts]

32:01.550 --> 32:04.365
Rumple, lift the spell!

32:04.390 --> 32:05.891
I can't.

32:07.198 --> 32:09.205
What's going on? Who's
on the boat with her?

32:09.229 --> 32:12.898
The real villain, of course.

32:15.871 --> 32:17.668
No. Get away from me!

32:17.693 --> 32:19.997
I didn't come all this way to stop now.

32:20.262 --> 32:22.932
After all, when I heard you
were trapped aboard this ship,

32:22.957 --> 32:24.842
I couldn't believe my good luck.

32:24.867 --> 32:27.902
Finally, the chance I needed
to make the Dark One pay.

32:28.226 --> 32:31.194
But please, she's got
nothing to do with this.

32:31.338 --> 32:33.606
Neither did Mary.

32:36.298 --> 32:38.404
Please, please, please don't do this.

32:38.429 --> 32:41.031
[Baton humming]

32:45.607 --> 32:47.074
That's quite enough of that.

32:49.478 --> 32:50.578
[Grunts]

32:53.188 --> 32:54.689
[Gasps]

32:59.421 --> 33:02.266
This story isn't over yet.

33:02.291 --> 33:03.458
Dark One...

33:04.606 --> 33:05.773
I command you...

33:08.964 --> 33:10.631
[Gasps]

33:13.473 --> 33:15.207
[Groans]

33:15.663 --> 33:17.631
[Gasps]

33:22.047 --> 33:23.611
[Groans]

33:33.509 --> 33:35.156
Well...

33:36.384 --> 33:39.129
it appears there was one final twist.

33:40.162 --> 33:41.080
[Sighs]

33:41.105 --> 33:43.173
There you are.

33:43.425 --> 33:45.593
Looks like you got
what <i>you</i> wanted.

33:45.627 --> 33:47.699
Now we know the serum works.

33:47.724 --> 33:49.258
It wasn't the serum.

33:49.765 --> 33:51.299
Hyde destroyed it.

33:51.737 --> 33:53.190
Then how the hell is he dead?

33:53.215 --> 33:54.706
I think we have just discovered

33:54.731 --> 33:57.608
the only foolproof way to
destroy one's doppleganger...

34:00.214 --> 34:02.348
by killing the original.

34:04.078 --> 34:05.645
Wait. You're saying...

34:06.874 --> 34:10.139
the way to take out the Evil Queen...

34:10.212 --> 34:12.179
Is to kill you.

34:38.438 --> 34:40.165
You okay?

34:40.201 --> 34:41.813
I have to die.

34:41.862 --> 34:43.129
What?

34:43.164 --> 34:45.998
To stop the Evil Queen, I have to die.

34:46.024 --> 34:47.525
That's how it works.

34:47.835 --> 34:50.572
That's not the only
bad news I got today.

34:50.597 --> 34:52.899
We all thought Jekyll was the good one.

34:54.065 --> 34:58.630
But even though he separated
himself from the darkness...

34:58.701 --> 35:01.937
the capacity for evil remained.

35:02.989 --> 35:05.423
And it remains in you.

35:05.513 --> 35:07.675
It can grow back at any time.

35:07.839 --> 35:09.057
You're stronger than Jekyll.

35:09.082 --> 35:09.982
Maybe.

35:10.693 --> 35:12.977
But if I'm not...

35:14.966 --> 35:18.415
Back in Camelot, when
you were the Dark One,

35:18.450 --> 35:22.066
you said you trusted
me to do what it took

35:22.091 --> 35:24.597
to keep your family safe.

35:24.714 --> 35:27.140
I need you to promise me
you'll do the same thing

35:27.165 --> 35:28.466
if it comes to that.

35:29.476 --> 35:31.328
I won't let it come to that.

35:32.397 --> 35:34.665
Promise.

35:47.018 --> 35:49.019
You cut your hair.

35:50.181 --> 35:51.281
You noticed.

35:51.330 --> 35:52.289
I would have earlier,

35:52.314 --> 35:54.562
but you were too busy trapping me.

35:54.858 --> 35:55.792
Well, I'm sorry.

35:55.817 --> 35:57.718
I-I just wanted to, uh...

35:58.389 --> 35:59.647
to make a fresh start.

35:59.672 --> 36:01.172
I don't want to hear it.

36:02.300 --> 36:04.553
You know, you've destroyed two lives

36:04.578 --> 36:06.764
where there used to only be one.

36:06.816 --> 36:08.418
You just keep finding new ways

36:08.443 --> 36:10.218
to increase the suffering
around you, don't you?

36:10.252 --> 36:11.406
That was never my intention.

36:11.431 --> 36:13.465
Well, then what <i>was</i>
<i>your intention?</i>

36:14.549 --> 36:16.313
Why did you go to Jekyll
in the first place?

36:16.338 --> 36:18.593
What could possibly be worth

36:18.618 --> 36:20.637
all of this death and destruction?

36:29.664 --> 36:31.873
Rumplestiltskin: Going somewhere?

36:31.907 --> 36:33.745
Just when things have
gotten interesting.

36:33.770 --> 36:35.988
News of what you've
done to that poor girl

36:36.013 --> 36:38.381
has spread like wildfire
throughout the city.

36:40.343 --> 36:42.954
We really let the animal out
of the cage with you, didn't we?

36:42.979 --> 36:44.275
I didn't kill Mary!

36:44.306 --> 36:46.341
[Giggles] You're gonna
have to do better than that.

36:46.375 --> 36:48.276
[Crying] You have to
believe me. It was Jekyll.

36:48.310 --> 36:49.877
Such passionate defense!

36:49.912 --> 36:52.513
I could never, not to Mary.

36:55.698 --> 36:57.018
You loved her.

36:57.678 --> 36:59.420
Very much.

36:59.455 --> 37:01.723
How can you be so weak?!

37:01.757 --> 37:04.392
- [Gasping]
- Now all of this is failure...

37:04.426 --> 37:07.462
complete and utter failure.

37:08.031 --> 37:10.448
My experiment has been a waste.

37:10.473 --> 37:14.885
I should end your
miserable life right now!

37:15.104 --> 37:16.104
But...

37:16.138 --> 37:17.590
[Groaning]

37:17.615 --> 37:20.350
your fate is worse than death.

37:21.064 --> 37:24.535
You shall have to share a life
with the weakness inside you.

37:24.560 --> 37:26.761
[Sobbing]

37:28.882 --> 37:31.709
What is all this about?

37:31.734 --> 37:34.335
Why did you do this?

37:36.171 --> 37:41.008
My reasons are just that... mine.

37:42.530 --> 37:43.730
Why?

37:43.755 --> 37:46.189
Why did you do this?

37:49.725 --> 37:51.492
You.

37:52.311 --> 37:54.321
It was all about you.

37:56.703 --> 37:58.077
I sought him out

37:58.102 --> 38:02.375
when you became the maid in my
castle all those years ago...

38:02.806 --> 38:05.678
because I had begun to
have feelings for you...

38:06.212 --> 38:08.614
and I thought they would make me weak.

38:09.613 --> 38:10.733
A-And you thought what,

38:10.758 --> 38:14.386
that Jekyll's serum would
rid you of those feelings?

38:14.411 --> 38:15.878
I'd hoped.

38:17.096 --> 38:19.865
But the experiment was a failure.

38:20.188 --> 38:22.547
In anger, I took his precious necklace

38:22.572 --> 38:24.390
and sent him to the
Land of Untold Stories,

38:24.415 --> 38:26.888
but it didn't solve anything.

38:26.913 --> 38:28.705
And I'm glad that it didn't...

38:29.600 --> 38:31.990
because I would never want to
lose the love I feel for you.

38:32.015 --> 38:35.384
You locked me on that
ship like a prisoner.

38:35.592 --> 38:38.018
Did you even think about
what would have happened

38:38.043 --> 38:39.066
if Jekyll had succeeded,

38:39.091 --> 38:40.956
what would have happened to our son?

38:40.981 --> 38:42.298
I was only trying to protect you.

38:42.323 --> 38:45.528
I don't need your protection, okay?

38:45.553 --> 38:48.622
Not at the cost I keep paying with you.

38:48.888 --> 38:51.386
God, you didn't... you
didn't cut your hair for me.

38:51.411 --> 38:54.936
You cut it for you because
you are sick and tired

38:54.961 --> 38:56.979
of looking at the man in the mirror.

38:57.004 --> 38:59.138
But you forget...

39:00.300 --> 39:03.535
I always see you for who you are.

39:05.798 --> 39:07.043
Yeah.

39:11.806 --> 39:13.846
No, um...

39:14.671 --> 39:18.341
you may not think
that you need me, Belle,

39:18.985 --> 39:20.285
but you will.

39:21.650 --> 39:24.022
You forget whose child
it is you're carrying.

39:24.941 --> 39:27.687
He will have a mark on his
head by virtue of who he is,

39:27.712 --> 39:30.447
and if you want what's best for him...

39:30.472 --> 39:32.507
you will come back to me.

39:34.075 --> 39:37.779
Threats won't make me
love you again, Rumple.

39:37.804 --> 39:38.937
No.

39:39.692 --> 39:42.564
But necessity will.

39:55.547 --> 39:57.031
Good night.

39:57.056 --> 39:59.057
Oh, wait. I have something for you.

40:04.233 --> 40:05.421
[Chuckles]

40:05.446 --> 40:06.646
What's that for?

40:06.880 --> 40:10.476
It's a tradition in this world
that, for personal reasons,

40:10.501 --> 40:11.685
I just can't get behind.

40:11.693 --> 40:14.061
But they're delicious. Enjoy.

40:14.095 --> 40:15.340
- Thank you.
- Mm.

40:15.365 --> 40:17.900
- See you tomorrow.
- Hey.

40:18.600 --> 40:21.468
That princess from
your kingdom...

40:21.784 --> 40:24.185
did she ever fix things there?

40:25.940 --> 40:28.997
I left for the Land of Untold Stories,

40:29.022 --> 40:31.490
but... I don't think so.

40:32.442 --> 40:34.357
Maybe someday.

40:34.864 --> 40:36.116
Maybe.

40:36.524 --> 40:37.806
Good night, Snow.

40:44.260 --> 40:49.764
[Crickets chirping]

40:53.416 --> 40:55.684
You can come out now.

40:59.974 --> 41:02.269
Where have you been?

41:02.294 --> 41:03.870
I had to wait until dark

41:03.895 --> 41:05.362
to make sure it was safe.

41:05.593 --> 41:07.458
Then they still don't
know who you really are?

41:07.483 --> 41:08.783
They have no idea.

41:09.261 --> 41:10.765
And what of your mission?

41:10.790 --> 41:13.292
Have you found any evidence he's here?

41:13.888 --> 41:15.322
No.

41:15.356 --> 41:16.825
But I know he is.

41:16.850 --> 41:18.226
I've foreseen it.

41:18.251 --> 41:20.316
I did not come this far
and sacrifice so much

41:20.341 --> 41:22.275
only to give up on finding Aladdin.

41:23.866 --> 41:24.766
I know,

41:25.159 --> 41:27.320
and I won't leave your side until we do.

41:27.345 --> 41:30.335
I promise you, we
will find him, Jasmine.
