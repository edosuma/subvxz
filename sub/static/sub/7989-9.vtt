00:02.366 --> 00:03.695
Why did Wozniak frame Miguel Zepeda?

00:03.698 --> 00:04.861
Miguel was my boyfriend.

00:04.863 --> 00:07.596
He worked me like a speed
bag for two years.

00:07.636 --> 00:09.698
If you help me find another
way to nail Wozniak,

00:09.700 --> 00:11.829
I won't pursue anything else
involving Miguel Zepeda.

00:11.831 --> 00:13.826
He's been talking about
something big going down.

00:13.828 --> 00:16.056
You're about to move a
lot of illegal cash.

00:16.059 --> 00:17.955
Woz is convinced that
Saperstein's the mole.

00:17.957 --> 00:19.153
You've been talking to the Feds.

00:19.155 --> 00:20.319
I had no choice.

00:20.321 --> 00:21.317
Whoa!

00:21.319 --> 00:22.982
Stop! He's still breathing!

00:22.984 --> 00:24.080
Did you do it?

00:24.082 --> 00:26.411
He's my friend too, and a cop!

00:27.444 --> 00:28.508
Bomb threat just called in.

00:28.510 --> 00:29.906
<i>We located a suspicious package.</i>

00:33.737 --> 00:35.366
I will make this right.

00:35.368 --> 00:38.196
Wozniak killed Saperstein.
Get me a wire.

<i>662. Come in, 662.</i>

01:49.942 --> 01:51.870
<i>Calling Detective Saperstein.</i>

01:53.138 --> 01:55.766
<i>All units, be advised,</i>

01:55.768 --> 01:58.795
<i>Detective David Saperstein
has gone quiet.</i>

01:58.797 --> 02:01.026
<i>He will be 10-7.</i>

02:01.028 --> 02:03.989
<i>He is honorably cleared from duty.</i>

02:05.688 --> 02:08.683
<i>We'll take it from here.</i>

02:11.447 --> 02:13.377
Seeing you in blue takes me back.

02:16.774 --> 02:20.401
You work plain clothes
as long as I have,

02:20.403 --> 02:24.863
uniform becomes a symbol of tragedy.

02:24.865 --> 02:26.694
Keep the thing in the back of my closet

02:26.696 --> 02:28.425
so I don't have to see it.

02:32.820 --> 02:35.616
Think people are wondering
why I didn't speak?

02:35.618 --> 02:39.378
No, I think they understand.

02:39.380 --> 02:42.341
No, they don't.

02:42.343 --> 02:43.839
I do.

02:48.236 --> 02:51.097
All we can do is hope for forgiveness.

02:56.458 --> 02:57.955
I'm gonna go home.

03:01.119 --> 03:02.882
You should too.

03:17.965 --> 03:20.094
How are you holding up?

03:20.096 --> 03:21.658
I'm not.

03:21.660 --> 03:23.389
Nothing puts priorities in perspective

03:23.391 --> 03:26.952
like a senseless death.

03:26.954 --> 03:29.815
I couldn't sleep last night;
I kept running scenarios

03:29.817 --> 03:31.546
how I could have prevented it.

03:31.548 --> 03:36.806
If we're listing regrets,
I think I got you beat.

03:37.706 --> 03:38.771
Come on in.

03:48.992 --> 03:51.354
You bought me a gift?

03:51.356 --> 03:54.385
New wire for a new day.

03:54.387 --> 03:56.348
Same stone, same setting.

03:56.350 --> 03:57.647
Don't get excited.

03:57.649 --> 04:00.443
Doesn't make us engaged.

04:00.445 --> 04:02.841
Good, 'cause I actually
need this one back

04:02.843 --> 04:05.637
in one piece when we're done.

04:05.639 --> 04:09.466
You thirsty? I think I
have some iced tea.

04:09.468 --> 04:11.530
Yeah, sure, yeah.

04:12.996 --> 04:16.822
Has Wozniak mentioned anything
more about the score?

04:16.825 --> 04:19.420
Timeline? Details?

04:19.422 --> 04:20.885
I mean, I can nudge him a little bit,

04:20.887 --> 04:23.648
but he doesn't seem eager.

04:23.650 --> 04:25.279
Heart's not in it.

04:25.281 --> 04:27.177
Well, let me guess.

04:27.179 --> 04:29.441
He stood out there today in
front of the rank and file

04:29.443 --> 04:32.270
and played the guilt-stricken
patriarch to perfection.

04:32.272 --> 04:35.799
No. It was real.

04:35.801 --> 04:37.663
You'd have to know
Wozniak to understand.

04:37.665 --> 04:40.693
I do know him, Harlee.
I profiled the man.

04:40.695 --> 04:42.957
Wozniak may have killed Saperstein,

04:42.959 --> 04:44.921
but he also loved him.

04:44.923 --> 04:47.152
Harlee, I gave you my assurance

04:47.154 --> 04:50.447
that the information on
Miguel Zepeda stays buried.

04:50.449 --> 04:52.345
Your abusive ex-boyfriend
stays in jail...

04:52.347 --> 04:54.442
Didn't take you long
to remind me of that.

04:54.444 --> 04:56.008
But I need you to keep the commitment

04:56.010 --> 04:57.506
that you made to me last night.

04:57.508 --> 05:01.001
Look, I'm not defending Wozniak anymore.

05:01.003 --> 05:04.497
I asked to wear that wire, for Sap.

05:04.499 --> 05:06.927
I'll find out whatever this job is...

05:06.929 --> 05:10.223
or was, if Wozniak decides not to do it.

05:10.225 --> 05:13.286
Don't worry.

05:13.288 --> 05:15.184
I'll take him down.

05:15.186 --> 05:18.878
Donnie, I'm not gonna be able
to make it to school tomorrow.

05:18.880 --> 05:21.309
Well, make sure you do. We're
going on a field trip.

05:21.311 --> 05:24.472
Well, I always cut during field trips.

05:25.970 --> 05:28.400
The job is going down in two days.

05:28.402 --> 05:30.165
<i>You wanted a face-to-face
with our partners,</i>

05:30.167 --> 05:32.195
<i>I made that happen.</i>

05:32.197 --> 05:34.992
Hope they don't want their C-4 back.

05:34.994 --> 05:37.855
<i>No, what they want is
to shake your hand.</i>

05:37.857 --> 05:40.218
Woz, there's a meet set.

05:40.220 --> 05:43.249
We're supposed to pick
up some kind of package.

05:43.251 --> 05:46.678
Donnie, I can't talk anymore.

05:56.933 --> 06:01.326
This is a good place to rest.

06:04.025 --> 06:06.753
This is a good place to rest.

06:25.064 --> 06:26.295
Oh, would you listen to that?

06:55.759 --> 06:57.522
You're not him.

07:39.304 --> 07:41.867
Hey.

07:41.869 --> 07:43.598
You didn't make it home.

07:43.600 --> 07:46.561
Nah. Linda called?

07:46.563 --> 07:50.290
No, just... you got dirt on your back.

07:50.292 --> 07:52.586
I was howling at the moon.

07:52.588 --> 07:54.318
You're carrying a lot right now.

07:55.785 --> 07:57.946
You know, there's no reason
that you have to handle that

07:57.948 --> 07:59.945
<i>all on your own.</i>

07:59.947 --> 08:03.007
<i>One bad night.</i>

08:03.009 --> 08:04.805
<i>And not an easy morning.</i>

08:04.807 --> 08:07.768
It's called a conscience. Tends
to act up after a murder.

08:07.770 --> 08:09.465
I'm not talking about the guilt.

08:11.697 --> 08:13.661
I'm ready to feel like a team again.

08:17.490 --> 08:19.819
Let me know when you are.

08:21.252 --> 08:23.681
The date's set.

08:23.683 --> 08:26.711
Job goes down day after tomorrow.

08:26.713 --> 08:30.207
Looks like she's finally
playing for the right team.

08:30.209 --> 08:33.236
<i>I gotta make sure that we're solid.</i>

08:33.238 --> 08:35.332
I'll get the details tonight.

08:35.335 --> 08:39.693
<i>If I like it, then I'll brief the crew,</i>

08:39.696 --> 08:42.457
<i>see if they want to do it.</i>

08:42.460 --> 08:45.054
Details tonight means
something's happening today.

08:45.056 --> 08:47.651
<i>An ice cream social.</i>

08:47.653 --> 08:49.116
12:30 this afternoon.

08:49.118 --> 08:50.581
I'll go with you.

08:50.583 --> 08:53.577
It's not a plus-one.

08:53.579 --> 08:54.842
Then I'll tail you.

08:56.443 --> 08:58.638
My turn to protect you.

08:58.640 --> 09:00.202
And if I'm you're partner in this thing,

09:00.204 --> 09:04.530
start treating me like your partner.

09:04.532 --> 09:06.827
I think you owe me that much.

09:16.861 --> 09:18.225
Busy morning?

09:18.227 --> 09:21.554
I used to do this every
day until I sank ten.

09:21.556 --> 09:23.086
Drove Saperstein crazy.

09:23.088 --> 09:24.484
I can't imagine why.

09:24.486 --> 09:26.615
He always put his cup on his desk.

09:26.617 --> 09:28.912
He... he never learned.

09:28.914 --> 09:33.806
Anyway, I'm at nine, and
this one feels lucky.

09:34.706 --> 09:36.402
Aw, man.

09:43.429 --> 09:45.624
Someone gonna answer it?

09:48.788 --> 09:51.084
Detective Saperstein's desk.

09:51.086 --> 09:55.345
So a robbery-in-progress calls
Saperstein's line and not 911.

09:55.347 --> 09:56.610
You think Sap was running his own

09:56.612 --> 09:58.308
secret Blackwater
operation for the hood?

09:58.310 --> 10:00.205
Down here.

10:00.207 --> 10:01.671
He said they were armed.

10:01.673 --> 10:03.168
Where's Loman when you need him?

10:03.170 --> 10:06.065
Well, he's covering the alley with Tess.

10:06.067 --> 10:07.564
Ladies first.

10:09.596 --> 10:11.758
NYPD! Let me see 'em!

10:11.760 --> 10:14.189
I get surprised, you get popped!

10:25.908 --> 10:27.905
Sir, I'm gonna need you to drop the gun.

10:29.969 --> 10:31.433
Look.

10:31.435 --> 10:33.930
I'm a police officer. I'm
not gonna hurt you, okay?

10:33.932 --> 10:35.861
But I need you to lower the weapon.

10:37.127 --> 10:38.957
Are you Isaiah?

10:38.959 --> 10:42.319
You called the precinct,
Detective Saperstein's phone.

10:42.321 --> 10:44.750
You know him, Saperstein.

10:44.752 --> 10:47.147
He was the next desk over
from mine; he's my friend.

10:49.779 --> 10:51.574
Keep those hands still
and do not reach for it!

10:51.576 --> 10:52.840
- No, he... he is...
- On your knees!

10:52.842 --> 10:54.005
He is not our guy.

10:54.007 --> 10:55.470
- Gun up, Harlee!
- He's the victim!

10:55.472 --> 10:57.534
You have not been in the other room.

10:59.233 --> 11:01.828
I guess we know why
he called Sap direct.

11:01.830 --> 11:03.227
Nothing surprises me now.

11:03.229 --> 11:04.859
Slow down, Tufo.

11:04.861 --> 11:05.990
Lot of facts missing.

11:05.992 --> 11:07.522
Harlee.

11:07.524 --> 11:08.953
You two take the scenic route?

11:08.955 --> 11:10.284
We had a runner.

11:10.286 --> 11:11.716
Suspect jumped off the fire escape

11:11.718 --> 11:13.414
when we showed up, ran
through that church,

11:13.416 --> 11:14.446
and out the back.

11:14.448 --> 11:15.811
Did you get a good look at him?

11:15.813 --> 11:18.475
I saw the back of his head and
the bottom of his sneakers.

11:18.477 --> 11:20.272
And he dropped this.

11:20.274 --> 11:21.704
I'm betting he's not gonna miss that.

11:21.706 --> 11:22.869
He had a whole duffel bag full.

11:22.871 --> 11:26.065
Expect the streets to run
hot in the next 24 hours.

11:26.067 --> 11:27.464
Is this the victim?

11:27.466 --> 11:28.894
Depends on your perspective.

11:28.896 --> 11:31.425
He's got a stockpile of
illegal prescription meds

11:31.427 --> 11:32.690
upstairs.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.122
Looks like a big operation.

11:34.124 --> 11:36.186
This guy had Saperstein on speed dial?

11:36.188 --> 11:38.450
Probably knew him better than we did.

11:38.452 --> 11:40.547
Hey, Father.

11:40.549 --> 11:43.277
You didn't see a duffel bag around here?

11:43.279 --> 11:44.409
Should I be looking for one?

11:44.411 --> 11:45.541
Well, the suspect had one.

11:45.543 --> 11:47.006
We thought he might have
ditched it as he ran.

11:47.008 --> 11:48.271
You get a look at him?

11:48.273 --> 11:50.568
He was a kid, maybe 18.

11:50.570 --> 11:51.766
Well, that's a man on the streets,

11:51.768 --> 11:52.998
especially with a gun.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.896
Yeah, we think he hit up an
underground pill operation

11:54.898 --> 11:55.861
across the street.

11:55.863 --> 11:57.359
Doctor Isaiah.

11:57.361 --> 11:58.425
Doctor?

11:58.427 --> 11:59.556
He didn't tell you?

11:59.558 --> 12:00.888
He hasn't exactly been chatty,

12:00.890 --> 12:02.953
and now he's facing
possession with intent.

12:02.955 --> 12:05.150
He's a doctor, not a dealer.

12:05.152 --> 12:06.914
He treats people without insurance,

12:06.916 --> 12:08.445
serves the community.

12:08.447 --> 12:09.777
Not a mortal sin.

12:09.779 --> 12:11.575
Well, that's your area of expertise.

12:11.577 --> 12:13.439
We just want to find the drugs.

12:13.441 --> 12:16.468
Not my area of expertise.

12:17.602 --> 12:19.997
Where did you tell
everybody we were going?

12:19.999 --> 12:22.994
We're meeting new friends.

12:24.459 --> 12:25.924
<i>It's a little public.</i>

12:25.926 --> 12:27.987
We're not staying. Wait here.

12:27.989 --> 12:29.818
Give me a minute.

12:32.317 --> 12:33.813
<i>You got an address for me?</i>

12:33.815 --> 12:38.674
308 Caton Avenue, but I won't be there.

12:38.676 --> 12:40.173
There's a crisis at Internal.

12:40.175 --> 12:41.870
Court assignment just landed on my desk.

12:41.872 --> 12:43.635
So put it on someone else's.

12:43.637 --> 12:45.599
A no-show raises questions.

12:45.601 --> 12:46.898
You have to handle this one alone.

12:46.900 --> 12:49.661
I'm not alone. Harlee's with me.

12:49.663 --> 12:51.459
Well, you should have
discussed that with me.

12:51.461 --> 12:53.190
I would have, if I was a 12-year-old

12:53.192 --> 12:55.720
and needed adult supervision.

12:55.722 --> 12:57.118
When can you get here?

12:57.120 --> 12:59.249
I can't, it's a deposition.
It's gonna drag.

12:59.251 --> 13:01.413
Figure it out, Donnie.

13:01.415 --> 13:02.944
It's my job.

13:02.946 --> 13:04.941
I'm not bailing on you;
you're my partner.

13:04.943 --> 13:07.805
I know what the word means. Do you?

13:10.570 --> 13:13.664
What? No ice cream?

13:13.666 --> 13:17.060
No, just... taking a different car.

13:21.889 --> 13:23.718
<i>Oh, hold on.</i>

13:23.720 --> 13:24.883
She's good.

13:28.846 --> 13:30.876
Run that plate just in case.

13:35.805 --> 13:38.200
Hi, this is Agent Chen. I've
got to run a vehicle plate.

13:46.025 --> 13:48.288
What's with all the spy craft?

13:48.290 --> 13:50.185
You think the Feds
still have eyes on us?

13:50.187 --> 13:54.313
I'd have to be suicidal not
to take a few precautions.

13:54.315 --> 13:55.645
Are you?

13:55.647 --> 13:57.676
<i>I mean, feelings of guilt
can lead the subconscious</i>

13:57.678 --> 13:58.908
<i>to want to get caught.</i>

13:58.910 --> 14:02.104
<i>My subconscious can go screw itself.</i>

14:02.106 --> 14:04.667
Why not take a minute?

14:04.669 --> 14:07.596
You know, let the wounds heal.

14:07.598 --> 14:09.861
Because they pushed me here.

14:09.863 --> 14:12.357
Sometimes you have to
turn into the skid.

14:12.359 --> 14:15.720
You do realize that the FBI
is a national organization.

14:15.722 --> 14:18.716
I'm not flying blind.

14:19.749 --> 14:21.413
You have someone inside?

14:21.415 --> 14:23.843
Even in retreat, you have to attack.

14:23.845 --> 14:25.740
You should know that better than anyone.

14:25.742 --> 14:27.672
I don't recall getting a lesson.

14:27.674 --> 14:31.100
You gave it, to Miguel Zepeda.

14:31.102 --> 14:32.266
<i>How much further?</i>

14:32.268 --> 14:34.031
<i>About ten seconds.</i>

14:37.793 --> 14:39.890
Do you think Harlee was
more involved in Wozniak's

14:39.892 --> 14:42.619
Miguel Zepeda cover-up than she let on?

14:42.621 --> 14:44.816
I don't know. Let's focus on this meet.

14:44.818 --> 14:47.414
Text her and get her to push
the subject with Wozniak.

14:47.416 --> 14:50.643
Zepeda's not going anywhere.
He's on the back burner for now.

14:50.645 --> 14:52.741
Keeping an innocent man in
prison doesn't bother you?

14:52.743 --> 14:54.438
No, not as much as the
criminal conspiracy

14:54.440 --> 14:55.903
we're investigating, no.

14:55.905 --> 14:57.568
- More than a man's freedom?
- You wanna save puppies, Agent,

14:57.570 --> 14:59.598
join the ACLU.

15:04.493 --> 15:08.221
Silence makes us culpable.
We can't knowingly stand by.

15:08.223 --> 15:11.217
We make this case, Zepeda will walk

15:11.219 --> 15:13.048
and Wozniak will fill his bunk.

15:13.050 --> 15:16.111
I need you to stay focused
on the task at hand.

15:18.209 --> 15:21.505
And that is what we call
pay dirt, Agent Chen.

15:40.682 --> 15:42.245
You Wozniak?

15:46.941 --> 15:48.937
Package is in the trunk.

15:50.836 --> 15:51.999
Nice reflexes.

15:52.001 --> 15:55.029
You fill in the details,
I might accept delivery.

15:55.031 --> 15:56.960
No signature required, boss.

15:56.962 --> 15:59.324
We were supposed to have a face-to-face.

15:59.326 --> 16:01.188
I don't know whose face
you were hoping for.

16:01.190 --> 16:02.886
I got paid to deliver a car.

16:02.888 --> 16:05.649
This isn't the kind of job
that you find in the want ads.

16:05.651 --> 16:07.047
You're involved.

16:07.049 --> 16:09.911
Hate to disappoint, but I
am supposed to tell you

16:09.913 --> 16:11.842
to open the trunk in private
and act accordingly.

16:11.843 --> 16:13.473
- What if I open it now?
- Put it down!

16:13.475 --> 16:14.571
Not another step!

16:15.904 --> 16:18.001
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

16:18.003 --> 16:20.331
You should follow directions.

16:20.333 --> 16:23.061
That's not one of my strong points.

16:24.027 --> 16:25.425
Come on, Harlee, talk this down.

16:25.427 --> 16:26.523
We don't need a gunfight.

16:26.525 --> 16:27.755
Woz, what are we doing?

16:27.757 --> 16:29.420
This is what's gonna happen.

16:29.422 --> 16:32.349
I'm gonna see what gift
you brought to the party.

16:32.351 --> 16:35.146
If I like it, then
I'll start conversing.

16:40.175 --> 16:42.404
What? What is it?

16:42.406 --> 16:43.868
Start conversing.

16:43.870 --> 16:44.867
Back off, man.

16:44.869 --> 16:45.866
Easy.

16:45.868 --> 16:47.064
We can all walk away from this.

16:47.066 --> 16:48.163
Just drop the gun.

16:48.165 --> 16:50.028
When he does.

16:51.560 --> 16:52.624
Who is he?

16:52.626 --> 16:53.923
Who?

16:53.925 --> 16:55.687
We need to get down there.
He's lost control.

16:55.689 --> 16:58.284
No, it's just on edge, Agent.
I've seen this before.

16:58.286 --> 17:00.548
This is not the week to mess with me.

17:00.550 --> 17:01.546
Who is he?

17:01.548 --> 17:02.745
I told you, I got paid to drive.

17:02.747 --> 17:03.976
I don't know anybody involved.

17:03.978 --> 17:05.441
- Let him go!
- Back off!

17:07.506 --> 17:09.369
You seen this man before?

17:09.372 --> 17:10.601
- No.
- Huh?

17:10.603 --> 17:11.933
I swear.

17:11.935 --> 17:13.897
Kidnapped guy in the
trunk disagrees with ya.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.029
I don't know anything.

17:15.031 --> 17:16.060
Woz!

17:16.063 --> 17:17.560
I don't want this package.

17:18.726 --> 17:20.656
Take the car back to your people.

17:20.657 --> 17:22.253
I can't do that.

17:22.256 --> 17:23.917
Yes, you can.

17:23.920 --> 17:26.249
Your second option is
much more unpleasant.

17:26.251 --> 17:28.012
I can't take it back.

17:28.015 --> 17:29.611
The car was left in a parking garage.

17:29.613 --> 17:31.209
We never saw the guys.

17:31.211 --> 17:33.906
If I find that there's
more to this story,

17:33.908 --> 17:37.301
there's not a block in this
city that you'll be safe in.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.662
Go.

17:46.625 --> 17:48.588
I'd call that an escalation.

17:49.920 --> 17:52.749
<i>Harlee. Harlee.</i>

17:56.278 --> 17:57.742
Ugh! Ph...

18:00.042 --> 18:03.469
What's your name? Who did this?

18:03.471 --> 18:05.266
It's okay, we're not gonna hurt you.

18:05.268 --> 18:06.964
They said they'd kill my wife.

18:06.966 --> 18:09.661
Please, they said they'd kill her!

18:09.663 --> 18:13.490
Here, take him to the marina.
I'll be there in an hour.

18:13.492 --> 18:15.420
What, another package to pick up?

18:18.118 --> 18:20.448
Hang in there; you're gonna
have a hell of a dinner story.

18:20.450 --> 18:21.813
Wait, what's happening? Wait.

18:22.746 --> 18:24.242
Sorry.

18:24.244 --> 18:26.407
I'm gonna have to leave you
in there a little bit longer.

18:26.409 --> 18:27.905
No. No. Pl...

18:30.836 --> 18:33.898
Kidnapping better be part
of my immunity package.

18:48.020 --> 18:49.250
Almost there.

18:49.252 --> 18:50.344
You can't take this off?

18:50.375 --> 18:51.337
Maybe on the second date.

18:55.401 --> 18:57.398
What? What is it?

19:04.823 --> 19:08.151
Just in case you try to
feel your way out of here.

19:29.991 --> 19:32.321
This wasn't included in
your immunity deal either.

19:32.323 --> 19:33.486
Were you careful coming in?

19:33.488 --> 19:35.317
Yeah, I got Agent Chen
watching the perimeter.

19:35.319 --> 19:37.177
Okay. Be quick, all right?

19:37.240 --> 19:39.401
Has to look like he ran. Hit
me, make it believable.

19:39.403 --> 19:41.832
I'm not here to take him, Harlee.

19:41.834 --> 19:42.831
What?

19:42.833 --> 19:44.029
You have to get him out of here.

19:44.031 --> 19:46.859
I do that, and your cover is blown.

19:46.861 --> 19:48.491
I'm not holding a man hostage.

19:48.493 --> 19:50.887
Look, I know this doesn't feel right,

19:50.889 --> 19:53.751
but the best thing to do to
help him is to get him talking.

19:53.753 --> 19:55.515
He'll talk when he feels safe.

19:55.517 --> 19:56.481
Where is safe?

19:56.483 --> 19:57.812
These people have kidnapped him.

19:57.814 --> 19:59.742
You think they're not gonna
pay him another visit?

19:59.744 --> 20:00.742
Where do I put him?

20:00.744 --> 20:01.807
And if he's a dead end,

20:01.809 --> 20:03.672
we blew our only lead and your cover.

20:04.671 --> 20:07.833
No, Harlee, listen to me.

20:07.835 --> 20:09.664
I'm not gonna leave you
alone for a second.

20:09.666 --> 20:13.092
I won't let anything happen
to either one of you, okay?

20:24.979 --> 20:26.476
Well, if you're guilty, by all means,

20:26.478 --> 20:28.773
exercise your right to
contact your union rep.

20:28.775 --> 20:31.204
However, we could just take care
of this whole thing right here.

20:31.206 --> 20:32.935
Hate surprises?

20:32.937 --> 20:34.167
I know I do.

20:34.169 --> 20:35.365
- Lieutenant Wozniak...
- That feeling in your gut

20:35.367 --> 20:36.596
when you have no control
over the situation.

20:36.598 --> 20:38.195
We're in the middle of an interview.

20:38.197 --> 20:40.591
Time's up. Get over here.

20:40.593 --> 20:42.556
Get over here!

20:46.719 --> 20:49.114
There are good ideas and bad ideas,

20:49.116 --> 20:50.646
and then there's bad ideas!

20:50.648 --> 20:52.277
My plans changed last minute.

20:52.279 --> 20:54.242
Who is he? The guy in your trunk!

20:54.244 --> 20:56.406
Let me finish in there and
I'll come talk to you.

20:56.408 --> 20:57.704
Ten minutes, max.

21:07.759 --> 21:11.287
I told you, I want to speak
with Detective Saperstein.

21:11.289 --> 21:12.252
He's unavailable.

21:12.254 --> 21:13.351
Well, when will he be back?

21:13.353 --> 21:14.549
Look, can you think of anybody

21:14.551 --> 21:15.948
who would want to target your clinic?

21:15.950 --> 21:17.179
Oh, so you've deduced

21:17.181 --> 21:18.611
that I'm not a drug kingpin?

21:18.613 --> 21:20.110
You'd have better security.

21:20.112 --> 21:23.672
I wish I had. They
took most of my stock.

21:23.674 --> 21:25.103
Now I'll have to shut down services

21:25.105 --> 21:28.466
until I can build it up
again, maybe a year.

21:28.468 --> 21:31.362
People depend on me for treatment.

21:31.364 --> 21:32.927
Mothers.

21:32.929 --> 21:34.391
Children. Please, call Saperstein.

21:34.393 --> 21:36.655
If you want a lawyer, we can
call someone to hold your hand.

21:36.657 --> 21:38.453
I don't want a lawyer.
I want Saperstein.

21:38.455 --> 21:40.850
I'm not gonna say anything
until he comes back.

21:40.852 --> 21:45.111
He ain't coming back.

21:45.113 --> 21:47.143
Detective Saperstein is dead.

21:51.605 --> 21:53.001
Isaiah, how'd you know him?

21:54.567 --> 21:56.797
He was investigating one of the doctors

21:56.799 --> 21:59.227
who gives me his pharmaceutical samples.

21:59.229 --> 22:01.125
When he learned what I
do, he gave me his card.

22:01.127 --> 22:02.690
Oh, yeah?

22:02.692 --> 22:04.154
He was helping you out?

22:04.156 --> 22:08.316
He came through, more than once.

22:10.581 --> 22:12.844
No, I can't give you 3% and then give

22:12.846 --> 22:14.974
the fire department 4%, do
you know what I'm saying?

22:14.976 --> 22:17.038
This will ultimately
be in the public eye.

22:17.040 --> 22:18.936
What about the county sheriff's office?

22:18.938 --> 22:20.001
I got you, I got you,

22:20.003 --> 22:21.633
but I gotta deal with
not just your union.

22:28.358 --> 22:30.787
Are you hungry?

22:30.789 --> 22:34.716
<i>Got some pretzels, beef jerky,</i>

22:34.718 --> 22:36.914
<i>Vienna sausage.</i>

22:36.916 --> 22:39.310
How about some water? Beer?

22:40.445 --> 22:42.906
It's not room service, but I'm trying.

22:42.908 --> 22:44.570
If you're so concerned about my comfort,

22:44.572 --> 22:46.035
why don't you untie my hands?

22:46.037 --> 22:47.966
Look, I want to be here just
about as much as you do.

22:47.968 --> 22:49.930
Great. I'll drive.

22:49.932 --> 22:51.961
More tempting than you think.

23:00.551 --> 23:02.149
Say it.

23:02.151 --> 23:03.247
It's nothing.

23:03.249 --> 23:06.077
No, it's never nothing with you.

23:06.079 --> 23:07.475
Holding hands with your informant

23:07.477 --> 23:08.907
isn't exactly protocol.

23:11.238 --> 23:12.902
Profiling is.

23:12.904 --> 23:14.333
Harlee develops strong attachments

23:14.335 --> 23:15.565
to men who protect her.

23:15.567 --> 23:17.130
Only way she'll betray her current daddy

23:17.132 --> 23:18.395
is to give her a better option.

23:18.397 --> 23:21.325
Convenient theory for you.
Is that going in the report?

23:21.327 --> 23:23.422
Every impulse that leads
her away from Wozniak

23:23.424 --> 23:25.952
could make our case.

23:25.954 --> 23:27.650
<i>How did you end up here?</i>

23:29.116 --> 23:30.180
Can I get a name?

23:30.182 --> 23:31.579
No, can I get yours?

23:34.342 --> 23:38.070
Look, people just don't
get taken for no reason.

23:39.504 --> 23:41.633
You either pissed off the wrong people

23:41.635 --> 23:43.930
or someone thinks they can
get money to get you back.

23:43.932 --> 23:45.860
Why do you say "they" as
if you're not one of them?

23:45.862 --> 23:48.924
Because I'm not.

23:48.926 --> 23:52.219
You said they threatened your wife.

23:52.221 --> 23:54.316
I have family to protect too.

23:54.318 --> 23:56.414
Yeah, right, that's exactly
what you would say

23:56.416 --> 23:58.311
if you were playing good cop.

23:58.313 --> 23:59.610
I'm not playing anything.

23:59.612 --> 24:02.074
Well, no one is forcing you to do this.

24:02.076 --> 24:03.771
Yeah.

24:03.773 --> 24:05.103
That's what it looks like, right?

24:06.836 --> 24:08.565
We all like to think
that we're in control

24:08.567 --> 24:12.127
and not hanging on for dear life.

24:12.129 --> 24:15.790
But we're all just ships
at the mercy of the tides.

24:15.792 --> 24:17.222
You know, sometimes being powerless

24:17.224 --> 24:20.251
looks like those cords
around your wrists.

24:20.253 --> 24:22.082
Sometimes it doesn't.

24:25.246 --> 24:30.172
They... they made me tell my wife

24:30.174 --> 24:32.169
to act like nothing was wrong.

24:32.171 --> 24:35.299
As if that was possible.

24:38.896 --> 24:40.393
Her name is Ellen.

24:43.723 --> 24:45.786
<i>Maybe I can let her know you're okay.</i>

24:45.788 --> 24:47.551
<i>Maybe you're just testing me.</i>

24:47.553 --> 24:50.380
They said there was a bullet
waiting for me if I talked.

24:50.382 --> 24:53.409
<i>I have to imagine that
bullet comes from you.</i>

24:55.775 --> 24:57.937
I can't let you go,

24:57.939 --> 25:00.101
all right, because they'll
just find you again.

25:00.103 --> 25:03.197
And I can't tell you how I
got mixed up in all this,

25:03.199 --> 25:06.326
but I can try and figure
out what's going on.

25:06.328 --> 25:09.556
If you don't believe me...

25:09.558 --> 25:11.120
you can shoot me right now...

25:18.514 --> 25:21.641
And take your chances with
the ones who took you.

25:21.643 --> 25:25.003
God!

25:25.005 --> 25:26.701
Damn it!

25:26.703 --> 25:29.498
Uh, she works at First
Guardian Securities.

25:29.500 --> 25:31.762
It's in Brooklyn Heights.

25:33.762 --> 25:35.957
We're leaving before the
security detail gets here?

25:35.959 --> 25:37.987
If we're out of range,
we can't hear them.

25:37.989 --> 25:41.083
They're safe, and she
just gave us our lead.

25:46.711 --> 25:48.141
It's gonna be okay.

25:51.639 --> 25:53.468
God.

25:58.403 --> 25:59.767
Hey, your guy's not lying.

25:59.769 --> 26:01.199
He was a fully licensed physician

26:01.201 --> 26:03.528
till he helped his father
with an assisted suicide.

26:04.528 --> 26:06.325
That was the last hospital in the area.

26:06.327 --> 26:07.924
Zero ODs today.

26:07.926 --> 26:10.087
At least our burglar's
enjoying responsibly.

26:11.786 --> 26:14.781
Or the drugs never hit the streets.

26:16.979 --> 26:18.178
First Guardian Security.

26:18.180 --> 26:20.574
600 employees, mostly security guards.

26:20.576 --> 26:22.238
Cyber protection, corporate monitoring,

26:22.240 --> 26:25.068
alarm systems, armored
cars, vaults and safes.

26:25.070 --> 26:26.966
Who am I?

26:26.968 --> 26:28.365
Jonathan Lynch.

26:28.367 --> 26:31.428
You manage a string of
check-cashing stores.

26:31.430 --> 26:33.391
I couldn't have been a
hedge fund manager?

26:33.393 --> 26:36.654
Does Wozniak's crew read "global
security fraud" to you?

26:46.343 --> 26:48.806
Hi there. Jonathan Lynch.

26:48.808 --> 26:51.136
Can I speak to your
sales manager, please?

26:51.138 --> 26:53.234
Do you have an appointment?

26:53.236 --> 26:56.562
No, I was hoping you could get me one.

26:57.795 --> 26:59.393
Give me a name.

26:59.395 --> 27:01.922
Donnie.

27:01.924 --> 27:02.888
Donnie Pomp?

27:02.890 --> 27:04.552
He's not who you think he is.

27:04.554 --> 27:06.283
I think he's an Internal
Affairs officer.

27:06.285 --> 27:07.283
What am I missing?

27:07.285 --> 27:09.214
Survival sometimes depends

27:09.216 --> 27:12.143
on a few strategically placed lifeboats.

27:12.145 --> 27:13.874
Designed to drag you under?

27:13.876 --> 27:16.504
He helped solve our federal issues.

27:17.737 --> 27:21.797
He was your source in the mole hunt?

27:21.799 --> 27:24.128
You let me sweat it out
on Loman's shooting

27:24.130 --> 27:25.560
knowing that we were covered?

27:25.562 --> 27:29.721
I told you we were covered,
Harlee, I told you.

27:29.723 --> 27:31.652
You trust him more than me?

27:31.654 --> 27:32.950
It's complicated. I...

27:32.952 --> 27:34.982
Yeah, wrong answer.

27:34.984 --> 27:36.812
If you're bring I.A.D. into our circle,

27:36.814 --> 27:39.475
then you better damn well
trust him more than anyone.

27:39.477 --> 27:41.340
He brought us in.

27:41.342 --> 27:44.636
He delivered $50,000 just for listening.

27:44.638 --> 27:47.632
We're not committed until
I know the details.

27:47.634 --> 27:50.928
Yeah, and how do you like him so far?

27:50.930 --> 27:53.658
Plastic explosives, kidnapping?

27:53.660 --> 27:56.754
I know, I know, I know, he's
clearly out of his league.

27:56.756 --> 27:58.219
There's things I need to fix.

27:58.221 --> 27:59.650
How are you gonna fix this?

27:59.652 --> 28:01.948
We'll leave the kidnapped guy
on the boat for a few hours.

28:01.950 --> 28:04.011
I'll come by tonight and
make sure everything's okay.

28:04.013 --> 28:05.177
That's not a fix!

28:05.179 --> 28:08.006
Harlee, no more secrets.

28:09.439 --> 28:12.467
You know everything that I know.

28:14.200 --> 28:17.029
No.

28:17.031 --> 28:19.326
I know more.

28:35.807 --> 28:37.869
Well, I'm six months into a contract,

28:37.871 --> 28:40.466
and I'm just not happy with the service.

28:40.468 --> 28:42.330
Was equipment part of the package?

28:42.332 --> 28:45.061
Yes, but Ellen told me that
there are option plans

28:45.063 --> 28:46.591
for taking over those payments.

28:46.593 --> 28:47.757
Ellen?

28:47.759 --> 28:49.555
I spoke with her on the phone.

28:49.557 --> 28:52.584
We don't have an Ellen here.

28:52.586 --> 28:53.949
I could have sworn it was an Ellen.

28:54.984 --> 28:56.513
Not unless you called dispatch.

28:56.515 --> 28:58.676
Right, yeah, I did, dispatch for the...

28:58.678 --> 29:00.208
Armored car service?

29:00.210 --> 29:01.340
Right.

29:01.342 --> 29:02.638
Did you have a need there as well?

29:02.640 --> 29:05.069
Just a sec, excuse me. I'm in a meeting.

29:05.071 --> 29:08.098
<i>That you need to terminate.
Wozniak is in the building.</i>

29:10.629 --> 29:12.526
Well, I'll... I'll get right on that.

29:13.658 --> 29:15.422
- Can I help you?
- I need to see your boss.

29:15.424 --> 29:18.285
She's in with a client at the moment.

29:18.287 --> 29:19.883
Not anymore.

29:19.885 --> 29:22.514
Okay, have a seat. I'll be right back.

29:26.210 --> 29:29.238
Absolutely. Would five work out for you?

29:29.240 --> 29:31.769
Sorry, there's a police officer

29:31.771 --> 29:34.332
out front who really
wants to talk to you.

29:34.334 --> 29:36.429
I am so sorry. I'll be right back.

29:36.431 --> 29:39.992
Well, hey, I always have
time for New York's finest.

30:03.144 --> 30:04.209
Where is he?

30:04.211 --> 30:06.739
I don't know. He was right here.

30:06.741 --> 30:08.204
I don't understand.

30:08.206 --> 30:10.334
A good investigator goes
where the case takes them.

30:10.336 --> 30:11.367
Zepeda is a viable lead.

30:11.369 --> 30:12.498
There's something to be said

30:12.500 --> 30:14.329
for building a case on what we know.

30:14.331 --> 30:16.726
I told you, we're off Zepeda for now.

30:16.728 --> 30:18.124
If this road dead-ends, we'll need

30:18.126 --> 30:19.323
an alternate route to Wozniak.

30:19.325 --> 30:20.521
It's not going to dead-end.

30:20.523 --> 30:22.518
The fact that Wozniak and I
are chasing the same leads

30:22.520 --> 30:23.850
means that we're on his heels.

30:23.852 --> 30:25.982
We know Zepeda's an
innocent man in prison.

30:25.984 --> 30:28.511
Justice doesn't just happen, it's made.

30:28.513 --> 30:30.409
When that falls to you,
you can't ignore it.

30:30.411 --> 30:33.439
Well, I'm ignoring you.
Meet me back at the office.

30:46.257 --> 30:47.887
I got your message.

30:47.889 --> 30:50.084
No, I don't think you did, Harlee.

30:50.086 --> 30:52.049
When you decide to share
a lead with Wozniak,

30:52.051 --> 30:54.013
you need to tell me.
First Guardian Security.

30:54.015 --> 30:56.809
We almost tripped over each other.

30:56.811 --> 30:59.206
Why would I tell you something
that you heard live?

30:59.208 --> 31:01.404
I didn't hear you tell him, so
I went to look into the wife,

31:01.406 --> 31:03.601
and I wound up looking
at a bull with a badge.

31:03.603 --> 31:06.630
Well, then you missed
the real development.

31:11.891 --> 31:14.254
Look into an NYPD
Internal Affairs officer

31:14.256 --> 31:15.586
named Donnie Pomp.

31:15.588 --> 31:17.018
Look into him? I've already met him.

31:17.020 --> 31:18.649
He was the one who was
following your crew.

31:18.651 --> 31:20.547
Yeah, searching for your informant.

31:20.549 --> 31:21.611
Searching for me.

31:21.613 --> 31:24.508
He's the one who brought
Wozniak the job,

31:24.510 --> 31:26.806
and I think he's pulling the strings.

31:36.794 --> 31:38.358
Most folks come in here

31:38.360 --> 31:41.287
seeking either solace or solitude.

31:41.289 --> 31:42.685
Never been much for solitude,

31:42.687 --> 31:45.549
and there's not much solace
circulating these days.

31:45.551 --> 31:47.147
Maybe just a friendly ear?

31:47.149 --> 31:49.344
There's a saint I can't remember.

31:49.346 --> 31:52.573
I heard a mother praying to him once.

31:52.575 --> 31:54.871
Patron saint of missing people.

31:54.873 --> 31:58.632
Saint Anthony of Padua. Lost things.

31:58.634 --> 31:59.698
Must have been a sad prayer.

31:59.700 --> 32:00.896
Oh, it was. Listen.

32:00.898 --> 32:04.358
Have you lost something?

32:05.859 --> 32:10.384
Uh...

32:10.386 --> 32:13.780
Friend.

32:13.782 --> 32:16.177
I lost him 'cause he
never really existed,

32:16.179 --> 32:18.474
not in the way I thought he did.

32:18.476 --> 32:21.437
I sat next to him every day, but, uh...

32:24.767 --> 32:28.129
Well, funny thing is, I...

32:28.131 --> 32:32.357
I miss the person I thought he was,

32:32.359 --> 32:35.319
the person that was never there.

32:40.814 --> 32:43.043
I wish I could talk to him.

32:48.870 --> 32:51.599
Yeah, well, he's...

32:51.601 --> 32:55.361
he's gonna love this.

32:55.363 --> 32:59.224
I need to see that duffel
bag of drugs you're hiding.

32:59.226 --> 33:02.885
Maybe you were hoping to be
Saint Anthony to Doctor Isaiah.

33:05.483 --> 33:08.978
Our conscience is a
connection to the divine.

33:08.980 --> 33:10.908
It tells us what's right and wrong.

33:10.910 --> 33:15.769
When what's right doesn't square
with the letter of the law,

33:15.771 --> 33:18.432
then there's a choice to be made.

33:18.434 --> 33:19.598
Okay, you lost me on that one.

33:19.600 --> 33:22.494
Isaiah has made his choice.

33:22.496 --> 33:25.491
I wasn't talking about Isaiah.

33:29.187 --> 33:30.883
Miguel Zepeda?

33:30.885 --> 33:32.615
You want to tell me why
the FBI is invested

33:32.616 --> 33:34.346
in a ten-year-old murder case?

33:34.348 --> 33:36.910
It touches an ongoing investigation.

33:36.912 --> 33:38.641
Which part of it?

33:38.643 --> 33:41.070
Buried 911 call? The
suppressed eyewitness?

33:41.072 --> 33:43.002
The entire case.

33:43.004 --> 33:45.199
I hate this kind of file.

33:45.201 --> 33:47.064
It says the people who've
sworn to serve justice

33:47.066 --> 33:48.628
are making a mockery of it.

33:48.630 --> 33:51.491
You're the district attorney. You
can do something about that.

33:51.493 --> 33:52.990
Why didn't you go to the defense?

33:52.992 --> 33:54.953
I'm interested in doing the right thing,

33:54.955 --> 33:56.519
not sparking a lawsuit.

33:56.521 --> 33:59.747
You sure you're from New York?

33:59.749 --> 34:01.412
If you don't cut a deal
for Miguel Zepeda,

34:01.414 --> 34:03.443
this is going to land
right back on your desk,

34:03.445 --> 34:06.872
only it won't be in a file;
it'll be in a headline.

34:06.874 --> 34:09.136
The FBI doesn't want a
police corruption scandal

34:09.138 --> 34:11.067
interfering with an investigation.

34:12.732 --> 34:14.995
Mr. Zepeda's lucky day.

34:16.761 --> 34:20.022
Here you go.

34:20.024 --> 34:21.887
She's an armored car dispatcher.

34:21.889 --> 34:23.751
Kidnapped husband is a chef.

34:23.753 --> 34:25.216
So she's the target.

34:25.217 --> 34:27.080
Gotta be some kind of leverage play,

34:27.081 --> 34:28.777
using the husband to get to her.

34:28.780 --> 34:30.942
He couldn't have known, Wozniak.

34:30.944 --> 34:32.474
Doesn't fit his code.

34:32.476 --> 34:34.504
Does murder?

34:41.097 --> 34:42.427
Ellen, I work for the NYPD.

34:42.429 --> 34:44.391
Your phone's gonna ring. Answer it.

34:48.090 --> 34:49.319
Hello?

34:49.321 --> 34:50.882
I know your husband's been kidnapped.

34:50.885 --> 34:53.047
I know where he is, and I'm
gonna make sure he stays safe.

34:53.049 --> 34:55.179
Oh, thank God.

34:55.181 --> 34:57.508
Have they contacted you about a ransom?

34:57.510 --> 35:00.272
I got a call after he was taken.

35:00.274 --> 35:02.103
They knew where I worked.

35:02.105 --> 35:04.233
They said as long as I
followed the instructions

35:04.235 --> 35:05.931
they would bring him back.

35:05.933 --> 35:07.530
What instructions?

35:07.532 --> 35:10.925
I don't know. They said
they'd be coming soon.

35:10.927 --> 35:13.089
What do I do?

35:13.091 --> 35:15.553
My number's the only one
in this phone book.

35:15.555 --> 35:18.449
When you get something, call me.

35:35.587 --> 35:38.415
Isaiah.

35:38.417 --> 35:40.980
Let's go, Doctor. Car's waiting.

35:42.279 --> 35:43.842
- I can go?
- Yeah.

35:43.844 --> 35:45.640
Your arrest was voided. Come on.

35:55.462 --> 35:57.891
Don't forget about this.

35:57.893 --> 36:00.099
Loman here forgot to
sign it into evidence.

36:00.182 --> 36:01.911
Must have slipped my mind.

36:01.913 --> 36:05.840
Thank you, on behalf of many people.

36:09.337 --> 36:12.499
Yo, if you're ever in a tight spot...

36:12.501 --> 36:15.628
and you need a friend,

36:15.630 --> 36:16.860
call me first.

36:18.991 --> 36:21.520
You're my protection plan?

36:21.522 --> 36:23.585
I'm your new Detective Saperstein.

36:37.900 --> 36:41.296
<i>I had First Guardian Security
fax over a list of employees.</i>

36:41.298 --> 36:44.192
The guys that delivered
the kidnapped man,

36:44.194 --> 36:46.223
they're armored car drivers.

36:46.225 --> 36:49.851
The kidnapped guy's wife
works there as a dispatcher.

36:49.853 --> 36:51.583
So they're gonna use him as leverage,

36:51.585 --> 36:54.180
force her to assign them
to a certain pick-up.

36:54.182 --> 36:56.310
I guess.

36:58.209 --> 37:00.938
Does he know we're
heisting an armored car?

37:00.940 --> 37:03.634
I don't know yet. I'm about to find out.

37:06.166 --> 37:07.463
Detective Santos.

37:07.465 --> 37:08.928
Donnie.

37:08.930 --> 37:12.190
Harlee, can you close the
door on the way out, please?

37:24.709 --> 37:25.839
Does she know?

37:25.841 --> 37:29.402
She knows there's a
tied-up guy on my boat.

37:29.404 --> 37:31.100
She knows I almost
killed the delivery guy

37:31.102 --> 37:33.430
that brought him, only
he's not a delivery guy.

37:33.432 --> 37:35.595
Subtle move, showing up
at the security company.

37:35.596 --> 37:37.458
You could have compromised
the whole operation

37:37.460 --> 37:39.490
in an afternoon.

37:39.492 --> 37:42.319
A risk that could have been avoided

37:42.321 --> 37:45.316
if you'd just stepped
out of your deposition.

37:51.342 --> 37:52.972
You heard him tell me to leave.

37:52.974 --> 37:54.404
You have to get back in there.

37:54.406 --> 37:56.335
What, just stroll in
there with my best smile

37:56.337 --> 37:58.399
and ignite his suspicions again?

37:58.401 --> 38:00.063
They're not gonna talk in front of me.

38:00.065 --> 38:02.494
We need this conversation, Harlee.

38:02.496 --> 38:05.324
This is how you get out, right now.

38:05.326 --> 38:07.288
Do something.

38:23.602 --> 38:26.564
The kidnapped man's your
responsibility now.

38:26.566 --> 38:27.929
He's off my boat tomorrow.

38:27.931 --> 38:28.895
Done.

38:29.895 --> 38:31.059
I'm busy!

38:31.061 --> 38:32.756
Sorry. Captain's in the hallway,

38:32.758 --> 38:34.321
loaded for bear about signatures.

38:34.323 --> 38:37.284
I short-stopped him.

38:37.286 --> 38:38.316
Sign right there.

38:41.513 --> 38:42.777
Okay.

38:42.779 --> 38:44.275
You sure?

38:44.277 --> 38:45.440
Got it.

38:45.442 --> 38:47.838
Okay. As you were.

38:53.100 --> 38:55.295
I was promised a face-to-face.

38:55.297 --> 38:57.159
- It was a test...
- I get a guy in a trunk.

38:57.161 --> 38:58.990
It was a test of commitment, all right?

38:58.992 --> 39:00.855
The job is legit, but
the guy running things,

39:00.857 --> 39:02.153
he's got a lot to lose.

39:02.155 --> 39:03.352
And I don't?

39:03.354 --> 39:05.283
I am not calling the shots.

39:05.285 --> 39:07.280
I vouched for you, but he
needed to see that you could

39:07.282 --> 39:09.610
get your hands dirty, and
you did, so we're good.

39:09.612 --> 39:12.140
Oh, no, we're far from good.

39:12.142 --> 39:14.870
You tell your master I passed his test,

39:14.872 --> 39:16.901
now he's gotta pass mine.

39:16.903 --> 39:18.899
Tomorrow, I want a face-to-face

39:18.901 --> 39:22.994
and every last detail of this
mess you pulled me into,

39:22.996 --> 39:24.558
or else I'm blowing the whole thing up!

39:28.521 --> 39:31.517
<i>I am done. I'm done being played.</i>

39:31.519 --> 39:34.147
<i>Nobody is trying to play you!</i>

39:34.149 --> 39:35.378
<i>I would never risk what we have,</i>

39:35.380 --> 39:36.777
not for anything, and you know that.

39:36.779 --> 39:38.075
You know how I feel about you.

39:38.077 --> 39:41.305
<i>Don't do that! This has
nothing to do with us!</i>

39:41.306 --> 39:44.433
The whole thing is about
us, about our future.

39:44.435 --> 39:46.398
Come on, almost a year
now we've been together,

39:46.400 --> 39:49.061
<i>hiding in hotel rooms,
hiding our feelings.</i>

39:49.063 --> 39:51.091
<i>I want to be with you, Matt.</i>

39:52.857 --> 39:54.921
Ooh! Oh! Don't!

39:56.353 --> 39:59.016
<i>I don't like being lied to.</i>

39:59.018 --> 40:01.046
<i>Okay, I got it.</i>

40:01.048 --> 40:02.045
<i>Do you?</i>

40:02.047 --> 40:04.408
Yeah, full disclosure.

40:21.356 --> 40:24.717
Open up 412. Zepeda, you got a visitor.

40:27.182 --> 40:29.178
Wheels of justice never sleep, huh?

40:29.180 --> 40:31.408
I have an offer from the
District Attorney's office,

40:31.410 --> 40:33.039
expires at midnight.

40:33.041 --> 40:35.669
This is an affidavit stating
that you won't pursue litigation

40:35.671 --> 40:37.434
against the State of New York.

40:37.436 --> 40:41.295
Well, you see, that's always
been a dream of mine.

40:41.297 --> 40:43.260
So what am I giving it up for?

40:43.262 --> 40:46.523
Your freedom, tonight.

40:46.525 --> 40:47.855
I'm paroled?

40:47.857 --> 40:49.885
Parole would suggest you're guilty.

40:49.887 --> 40:51.583
You've been exonerated.

40:51.585 --> 40:55.078
You're free to the privileges
and pursuits of everybody else.

40:59.708 --> 41:03.435
Wonder what I should pursue first.
