49:59.580 --> 50:02.708
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS

49:59.580 --> 50:02.708

50:12.008 --> 50:15.220
YOU SPEND ALL DAY TRYING

50:12.008 --> 50:15.220
TO FIND THE PERFECT OUTFIT.

50:15.220 --> 50:16.889

TAKE A SECOND LOOK.

50:18.933 --> 50:20.768
BUT THEY NEVER NOTICE.

50:20.768 --> 50:23.980
SOMETIMES I JUST WISH

50:20.768 --> 50:23.980
THAT THEY COULD

50:20.768 --> 50:23.980
TRADE PLACES WITH US

50:23.980 --> 50:26.607
SO THAT THEY WOULD KNOW

50:23.980 --> 50:26.607
