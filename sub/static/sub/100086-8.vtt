any minute.

07:24.574 --> 07:26.446
Bill and Vic aren't coming.
The hell you say to me?

chuck a yam at me?

Oh, butch it up.
It was cooked.

three days ago.

His side
is super infected.

Oh, that selfish bastard.

07:37.761 --> 07:38.936
He sends his love.

07:38.980 --> 07:40.329
And as for Vic,

07:40.372 --> 07:42.113
he's serving turkey dinners
at a homeless shelter.

07:42.157 --> 07:44.289
Of all the days
to do that.

07:44.333 --> 07:47.467
Yeah, I'm not sure your
perfect Thanksgiving plan
is working out.

It's okay.
We still have the Eagles.

07:49.033 --> 07:50.513

07:50.557 --> 07:52.036
You recorded
my Eagles game!

07:52.080 --> 07:53.429
Oh, I can explain.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.518
Uh, Adam did it.
Me?

07:55.562 --> 07:57.651
He's our common enemy
that we can all rally against.

07:57.694 --> 07:58.782
Just go with it.
It's fun.

07:58.826 --> 08:00.784

I'm going to the basement

08:00.828 --> 08:03.134
to play with my real friends,
Mario and Luigi.

they have accents.

Anyway, sorry
about your stupid game.

08:06.398 --> 08:07.835
I was just trying
to get the parade,

08:07.878 --> 08:10.141
and I pressed, uh,
one of your fancy
VCR buttons.

08:10.185 --> 08:12.709
But why would you
turn on the parade
during Murray's game?

08:12.753 --> 08:13.928
What? Are you
another parade hater?

08:13.971 --> 08:15.495
You ruined my game.

08:15.538 --> 08:16.974
But the Eagles won!

08:17.018 --> 08:18.759
They won?
Back to the parade.

[TAPE REWINDS]
Oh!

08:20.108 --> 08:23.894
Did it again.
They won in overtime
on a Hail Mary pass!

the worst day
of my life!

you see the game?

08:28.551 --> 08:30.205
Holy crap!
What a doozy!

08:30.248 --> 08:32.424
I hate football, and even
I thought it was thrilling,

08:32.468 --> 08:33.991
like watching a movie
about football.

08:34.035 --> 08:35.863
Such a doozy!

Oh, I could really feel
the city around us come alive
in those last few moments.

You saw the game, okay?

08:43.871 --> 08:46.221
And for some reason,
you keep saying "doozy."

08:46.264 --> 08:48.919
Erica said this night would
make us question everything.

it's a 40-minute flight,

took the last bag.

taking them,

back of the bottom drawer
in the galley.

be home right now.

our family's holiday bullcrap.

Listen, I got your back.

09:21.909 --> 09:24.085
Why don't we use
this handy-dandy air phone

that we're running
a little bit behind.

What? Why would he
give you one and not me?

pull his namesake.

with the fact
that I was taking
all the ice,
