01:26.253 --> 01:29.088
I'm counting at 10 armed
militia, maybe more inside.

01:30.458 --> 01:33.125

them two skinnies, Max.

02:28.916 --> 02:31.049
We don't want them bringing
their friends to the party.

02:31.051 --> 02:32.885

Well, good news is 12 grand

03:26.106 --> 03:30.943
And I believe we've got another
main target in the bush,

03:30.945 --> 03:33.078
it's worth another seven, if
we did, which I know we did,

03:33.080 --> 03:34.913
'cause we're fuckin' good.

03:34.915 --> 03:36.748
Not a bad day in the office

here's a lay down.

03:38.185 --> 03:39.017

03:39.019 --> 03:40.018

03:40.020 --> 03:42.187
- We'll talk about that, mate.

03:42.189 --> 03:44.022
Their lives like their deaths.

03:44.024 --> 03:45.891
Not really worth
much at all, is it?

03:48.262 --> 03:52.097
Why do you ask, Max, you're not
having doubts are you, mate?

03:52.099 --> 03:53.232

Get your rifle, let's go.

11:13.607 --> 11:16.174

I just watched you take

You want me to kiss the booboo?

11:27.821 --> 11:29.287
Hey!

Right, good work,
Squad Leader alone,

Well done, lads.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.740
Come on, I'll put

11:48.742 --> 11:50.375

that Facebook thing is he?

11:50.377 --> 11:52.410

to find a soulmate, boss.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.713

16:58.685 --> 17:01.419
- Hey, did you see me get
two men with one shot.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.021
Bullet went right
through his head.

17:03.023 --> 17:03.955
I tapped him too.

17:03.957 --> 17:05.623
Two kills on the one shot.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.458
- Yeah, we should be
selling the shit ourselves.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.527
We'd make 10 times what
they're makin' with the feds.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.061
- Yeah, yeah, right.

17:11.064 --> 17:13.364
You try moving that stuff
yourselves, be my guests.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.866
That's a more deprived
path that we're on.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.134
Trust me on that, boys.

17:16.136 --> 17:17.835
Pack it up, let's
move out in 20.

17:17.837 --> 17:19.037
Has anyone seen, Max.

17:19.039 --> 17:21.606
- No, I think I watched
him walk in this hut

17:21.608 --> 17:22.640
before it exploded.

17:22.642 --> 17:23.808
He's fuckin' dead.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.143
- Wait a minute, mate.

17:27.146 --> 17:28.113
Wait a minute.

17:28.114 --> 17:29.080
What do you mean,
you think he's dead?

17:29.082 --> 17:30.014
You're grenade--
- I watched him--

17:30.016 --> 17:31.282
- Max is my friend.

17:31.284 --> 17:32.083
- I watched him walk
in the fuckin' hut.

17:32.085 --> 17:33.551
- Don't fuck with me.

17:33.553 --> 17:34.786
- I watched him walk in
this hut before it exploded.

17:34.788 --> 17:36.387
He's fuckin' dead.

17:36.389 --> 17:39.991
- Then fuckin' look for him,
perimeter search right now.

17:39.993 --> 17:42.927
- He's another fuckin'
grunt, who gives a fuck!

17:42.929 --> 17:43.828
- Excuse me.

17:45.899 --> 17:48.833
Do you have problems
taking orders, do you?

17:48.835 --> 17:50.835
- (laughs) You need
to relax, boss.

17:50.837 --> 17:52.336
- You need to do your job.

17:52.338 --> 17:53.938
- I will.
- Off you go.

17:54.874 --> 17:59.911
(tense music)
(birds chirping)

18:00.580 --> 18:01.312
Max, do you copy?

18:04.050 --> 18:05.083
Come on, Max.

18:06.986 --> 18:10.121
Max, copy if you could, over.

18:10.123 --> 18:15.193
(birds chirping)
(tense music)

18:28.575 --> 18:30.908
- Max would never leave it.

18:30.910 --> 18:31.843
You know that.

18:33.546 --> 18:34.479
- What do we do, boss?

18:34.481 --> 18:36.147
Do we stay and look for him.

18:36.149 --> 18:38.116
- Yeah, well, we've only
got 20 minutes to settle up

18:38.118 --> 18:40.251
and haul this cargo,
make the rendezvous.

18:41.588 --> 18:43.187
Max knew what he signed up for.

18:46.326 --> 18:47.959
- High pay, high risk.

18:47.961 --> 18:49.727
- Okay, grab what
you need, let's move.

18:49.729 --> 18:52.964
(helicopter whirring)

19:00.373 --> 19:02.940
(tense music)

19:19.058 --> 19:24.128
(woman vocalizing)
(dramatic music)

19:32.372 --> 19:34.939
(Max gasping)

19:43.917 --> 19:47.151
(footsteps shuffling)

20:01.167 --> 20:04.468
(eerie music)

20:04.470 --> 20:07.138
(Max groaning)

20:09.876 --> 20:12.443
(Max moaning)

20:33.800 --> 20:36.634
(woman vocalizing)

20:36.636 --> 20:39.237
(Max groaning)

20:46.980 --> 20:49.914
(woman vocalizing)

20:53.086 --> 20:55.686
(water splashing)

20:55.688 --> 20:59.523
(singing in foreign language)

21:18.645 --> 21:23.714
(Max whimpering)
(eerie music)

21:31.257 --> 21:33.824
(Max moaning)

21:43.336 --> 21:46.504
(birds chirping)

21:46.506 --> 21:47.672
(Max moaning)

21:47.674 --> 21:49.940
- Your fever finally broke.

21:51.411 --> 21:54.412
You had a very bad
blood infection

21:54.414 --> 21:55.846
that was going to kill you.

21:59.085 --> 22:03.854
The doctor dressed your neck
wound and gave you antibiotics.

22:07.894 --> 22:10.461
Your feet looked
like they are sorely

22:10.463 --> 22:12.196
in need of a pair of sandals.

22:13.566 --> 22:15.499
You can have these
if you'd like.

22:17.870 --> 22:20.538
Where are you going,
huh? (laughing)

22:23.676 --> 22:28.746
You have no idea
where you are (laughs)

22:29.415 --> 22:30.381
or where you're going.

22:31.451 --> 22:33.184
Welcome to my parish.

22:33.186 --> 22:35.252
I am Father Elias.

22:36.189 --> 22:39.290
May I show you around, hm?

22:41.561 --> 22:43.661
Come with me, please.

22:48.568 --> 22:53.604
(birds chirping)
(dog barking)

23:02.181 --> 23:05.015
Your feet, are you sure you
don't want the sandals, hm?

23:05.985 --> 23:06.884
No?

23:14.627 --> 23:17.428
(doors creaking)

23:21.634 --> 23:24.769
(footsteps thudding)

23:31.778 --> 23:34.845
(people chattering)

23:37.683 --> 23:40.451
So, you take charity

23:40.453 --> 23:42.520
without offering
anything in return, hm?

23:43.723 --> 23:45.156
The antibiotics cost money

23:45.158 --> 23:47.625
this church can't
afford to spare.

23:47.627 --> 23:50.261
An honest man would want
to return the favor, huh?

23:51.631 --> 23:56.500
I need this place swept,
you do it and we're even.

23:59.105 --> 23:59.937
Hm?

24:00.840 --> 24:02.673
It's not complicated.

24:04.877 --> 24:08.112
You know it is said,
I am a benevolent man.

24:09.148 --> 24:11.782
But I am also a
practical one, my son.

24:12.952 --> 24:15.619
(gentle music)

24:17.423 --> 24:20.224
(birds chirping)

24:28.801 --> 24:31.602
(broom swishing)

24:39.712 --> 24:42.780
(footsteps tapping)

24:48.221 --> 24:50.087
I'm not the kind to take charity

24:50.089 --> 24:52.857
from a stranger without
giving an offer.

24:54.160 --> 24:57.995
You swept and I want to offer
you something in return.

25:00.500 --> 25:01.398
No?

25:02.768 --> 25:05.936
I decided sleeping under
my roof was on the house.

25:07.006 --> 25:08.873
I want to pay you
back with a warm meal.

25:11.944 --> 25:15.479
If you refuse, you make
me a dishonest man.

25:16.849 --> 25:20.050
That's a terrible thing to
do to a priest. (laughs)

25:21.287 --> 25:22.186
Come, my son.

25:26.893 --> 25:29.793
(woman speaking in
foreign language)

25:29.795 --> 25:30.861
(laughs) Let me see.

25:32.198 --> 25:37.167
Mm, Esther, (speaking
in foreign language).

25:37.169 --> 25:38.435
(woman laughing)

25:38.437 --> 25:43.140
(woman speaking in
foreign language)

25:43.676 --> 25:45.175
(both laughing)

25:45.177 --> 25:48.979
(speaking in foreign language)

25:48.981 --> 25:51.415
- [Thiago] Father Elias,
a letter from the church.

25:51.417 --> 25:52.583
- [Elias] Ah.

25:54.086 --> 25:55.286
- They want to know

25:55.288 --> 25:56.987
how the Wednesday night
services are going.

25:56.989 --> 25:58.989
- You wanted to be
in charge of that.

25:58.991 --> 26:01.125
They'd like more attendance.

26:01.127 --> 26:02.860
- But nobody wants to come.

26:02.862 --> 26:07.364
- Why don't we tell everyone
we'll be giving a free dinner,

26:07.366 --> 26:10.935
every Wednesday after
the service, huh?

26:10.937 --> 26:15.272
Often you have to give
something to receive.

26:15.274 --> 26:16.740
- Yes, that's a great idea.

26:16.742 --> 26:18.509
I'll make my stew.

26:18.511 --> 26:20.711
- Esther, perfecto.

26:20.713 --> 26:22.813
(speaking in foreign language)

26:22.815 --> 26:24.949
- I will do that, Father.

26:27.353 --> 26:29.019
But are we not
looking for a flock

26:29.021 --> 26:31.355
with a desire to
pray not just to eat?

26:31.357 --> 26:34.858
- Get them in here and
in front of you, Father.

26:34.860 --> 26:39.930
Then it is your job to instill
in them a desire to pray.

26:40.900 --> 26:43.534
(gentle music)

26:45.171 --> 26:50.240
Young priest, I'm hoping
his mind ages well,

26:50.910 --> 26:51.642
like a good wine.

26:52.878 --> 26:55.346
Esther serves breakfast at 7:00.

26:56.616 --> 26:57.948
You need to eat.

26:59.085 --> 27:01.218
I'll need my church
swept again tomorrow

27:01.220 --> 27:03.487
and you can pay me
back for breakfast, hm.

27:05.524 --> 27:07.825
Are you able to talk at all?

27:10.663 --> 27:12.096
Can you write your name?

27:13.833 --> 27:16.500
(gentle music)

27:26.646 --> 27:27.544
Ah.

27:29.248 --> 27:30.614
Max.

27:31.917 --> 27:36.453
Well, God be with
you, Brother Max.

27:37.790 --> 27:42.026
People choose to talk to
me, to unburden themselves.

27:43.362 --> 27:46.997
They tell me everything,
the teeniest to the sublime.

27:46.999 --> 27:51.435
When they genuinely want
to keep their secrets,

27:52.772 --> 27:56.840
they look away from
me the way you do.

28:00.346 --> 28:02.746
We didn't meet by chance.

28:04.150 --> 28:08.852
There was a reason as there
is a reason for everything.

28:13.225 --> 28:16.026
(broom swishing)

28:18.931 --> 28:21.565
(gentle music)

28:34.213 --> 28:37.014
(dramatic music)

28:39.719 --> 28:42.152
(Max puffing)

28:42.154 --> 28:44.822
(gun clicking)

28:47.893 --> 28:49.626
(Elias laughing)

28:49.628 --> 28:53.097
I see you found Father
Benedict's hiding place.

28:53.099 --> 28:55.199
That was his rifle.

28:55.201 --> 28:57.801
He would hunt
feral pigs with it.

28:57.803 --> 29:01.405
Father Thiago replaced them
when he died several years ago.

29:04.477 --> 29:07.211
Whenever he came
home with a meal

29:07.213 --> 29:10.547
we would share it
with our families.

29:13.219 --> 29:14.852
Please, put it back.

29:21.894 --> 29:24.027
(Elias sighs)

29:24.029 --> 29:27.331
I expect to see you at
Mass this evening, hm.

29:30.936 --> 29:33.904
(tense music)

29:33.906 --> 29:35.472
(birds chirping)

29:35.474 --> 29:39.543
I would like you to open
your Gospels to page eight,

29:39.545 --> 29:44.615
Matthew, the first chapter
in the Gospel, verse 44.

29:46.685 --> 29:51.355
"But I say to you,
love your enemies,

29:51.357 --> 29:54.491
"bless those who curse you.

29:54.493 --> 29:57.427
"Do good to those who hate you.

29:58.531 --> 30:02.432
"And pray for those
who spitefully use you

30:02.434 --> 30:04.301
"and persecute you."

30:04.303 --> 30:08.806
We are forced with this
challenge in our town,

30:08.808 --> 30:13.644
every day, from these men
who come down from the hills.

30:14.747 --> 30:18.148
They kidnap people and
blackmail their families

30:18.150 --> 30:20.751
so they'll work in the
jungles making drugs.

30:22.388 --> 30:27.457
You ask yourself why should I
do good to those who hate me?

30:29.261 --> 30:33.497
Because that is what
God asks us every day.

30:33.499 --> 30:38.569
That we may show these people
that life and love exists.

30:42.241 --> 30:47.277
And in that action we may
transform these people

30:48.414 --> 30:51.148
to become God's
children as well.

30:55.354 --> 30:56.420
Eat, my son.

30:59.091 --> 31:00.524
Ah, gracias, Esther.

31:02.561 --> 31:04.294
- Hold still.
- Wonderful, wonderful.

31:04.296 --> 31:06.530
Wonderful, let me taste, huh.

31:08.534 --> 31:12.402
Mm, Esther, the
soup is exquisite.

31:14.773 --> 31:19.176
(both speaking in
foreign language)

31:21.280 --> 31:26.350
(sighs) Someday,
with God's grace,

31:27.620 --> 31:31.221
she will learn to make
something other than stew, hm.

31:33.525 --> 31:35.726
Here, Father Thiago, welcome.

31:39.498 --> 31:40.831
- I am suggesting, Father,

31:40.833 --> 31:42.633
that he's probably
a dangerous man.

31:42.635 --> 31:44.668
He looks like a dangerous man.

31:44.670 --> 31:46.103
Frightening in fact.

31:46.105 --> 31:48.105
And it's not right he
stays under our roof,

31:48.107 --> 31:50.207
and eats at our
dining room table.

31:50.209 --> 31:51.441
And the scar on his neck?

31:51.443 --> 31:52.676
It's frightening people.

31:55.147 --> 31:56.179
- Frightening, whom?

31:57.249 --> 31:59.082
Has anyone complained.

31:59.084 --> 32:02.719
- Well, frankly,
it's frightening me.

32:02.721 --> 32:05.522
(birds chirping)

32:08.260 --> 32:09.493
- Perhaps you're right.

32:13.065 --> 32:16.133
(footsteps tapping)

32:17.670 --> 32:20.137
Father Thiago is concerned

32:20.139 --> 32:24.708
your appearance might
intimidate our parishioners.

32:24.710 --> 32:29.780
So, if you wear this
robe while you are here.

32:31.317 --> 32:32.582
You are not a priest,

32:32.584 --> 32:34.918
and you must not let
people think you are.

32:35.721 --> 32:38.555
But you work for the church

32:38.557 --> 32:41.258
and I say it is all right
for you to wear this robe.

32:42.561 --> 32:44.928
I hope you decide to stay.

32:47.132 --> 32:48.532
Have a good night, Max.

32:58.277 --> 33:01.345
(birds chirping)

33:01.347 --> 33:04.081
(woman gasping)

33:04.883 --> 33:06.616
- Excuse me, Father.

33:06.618 --> 33:10.320
- Excuse me, hello, he is not
a priest, don't talk to him.

33:10.322 --> 33:12.122
Hi, my child, I
am Father Thiago,

33:12.124 --> 33:13.857
I will answer any
questions you may have.

33:13.859 --> 33:18.261
(both speaking in
foreign language)

33:23.836 --> 33:25.002
- [Thug] I told you
she was gonna run!

33:25.004 --> 33:27.004
- Ah, shut up, I
know, I know, shut up!

33:28.741 --> 33:31.041
Hey, priest, where's the girl?

33:32.077 --> 33:36.646
- Hey, my friend
asked you a question?

33:38.384 --> 33:39.282
Where is she?

33:41.387 --> 33:42.652
- Where's the girl?

33:44.857 --> 33:46.923
(dramatic music)

33:46.925 --> 33:48.959
- I've seen this before.

33:48.961 --> 33:51.561
It's what the Sinaloa
Cartel does to chivatos.

33:52.664 --> 33:53.930
What were you, a snitch.

33:55.034 --> 33:57.901
- (scoffs) That fuckin'
explains everything.

33:57.903 --> 34:01.972
You know what, I'm
hungry and so is he.

34:01.974 --> 34:04.474
Go get us something
to eat, snitch.

34:06.078 --> 34:07.677
Oh, I'm sorry, priest.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.047
(woman whimpering)

34:10.049 --> 34:11.415
- You will be safe here.
- Gracious, padre.

34:11.417 --> 34:12.681
- We will protect you my child.

34:12.684 --> 34:14.985
(women speaking in
foreign language)

34:14.987 --> 34:17.254
Aye, please come.

34:17.255 --> 34:19.022
- Gracious, padre.

34:19.024 --> 34:20.357
- What are you doing?

34:21.360 --> 34:22.993
Don't feed them, are you crazy!

34:22.995 --> 34:24.928
We have to get rid of
them, they can hurt us.

34:24.929 --> 34:27.130
- This child is terrified.

34:27.132 --> 34:30.967
They tried to kidnap
her but she escaped.

34:30.969 --> 34:31.967
- [Thiago] What
are we going to do?

34:31.969 --> 34:33.136
- I will talk to them.

34:34.039 --> 34:37.007
(woman whimpering)

34:39.143 --> 34:41.511
- [Thiago] He's
encouraging them to stay?

34:41.513 --> 34:44.246
(door creaking)

34:51.023 --> 34:52.422
- Fuckin' took long enough.

34:55.828 --> 34:57.127
- Whoo, mm, mm.

34:59.932 --> 35:00.931
Do you bathe.

35:00.933 --> 35:03.033
Or does God just
smell like shit?

35:03.035 --> 35:04.768
- Mm, I smell it.

35:05.571 --> 35:06.903
That ain't shit.

35:06.905 --> 35:07.737
- Oh yeah.

35:07.739 --> 35:08.672
- It's piss.

35:08.674 --> 35:10.307
You fuckin' stink, priest.

35:10.309 --> 35:11.741
(thug laughing)

35:11.743 --> 35:13.877
So does this fuckin' food.

35:13.879 --> 35:16.680
(dramatic music)

35:18.117 --> 35:20.784
You fuckin' with me, priest.

35:20.786 --> 35:22.919
Fuckin' stand here and judge me.

35:22.921 --> 35:27.924
I'll gut you like a fuckin'
pig, neck to nuts. (spits)

35:27.926 --> 35:29.126
Clean all this shit up.

35:30.529 --> 35:32.162
Let's get the fuck out of here.

35:34.600 --> 35:38.001
- That was rather
anticlimactic, wasn't it?

35:38.003 --> 35:40.837
(birds chirping)

35:59.958 --> 36:01.625
- Good morning.

36:01.626 --> 36:03.293
Today, we will not
read from the book.

36:04.930 --> 36:10.000
But I would like to speak
about a member of our church.

36:11.103 --> 36:14.971
He is someone I trust
and I would like him

36:14.973 --> 36:18.408
to come forward so that
I may share his wisdom.

36:19.545 --> 36:23.346
Max, (laughs) Max.

36:23.348 --> 36:27.050
Through the use of nonviolence

36:27.052 --> 36:30.987
you saved the life
of this young woman.

36:30.989 --> 36:33.924
We all live under the
shadow of violence.

36:33.926 --> 36:38.728
But you faced two of
the Silver Cartel's men

36:39.898 --> 36:43.533
and you weren't hurt and
you didn't fight back.

36:45.170 --> 36:48.672
And that is a lesson
for our class.

36:48.674 --> 36:53.743
How important nonviolent
resistance is.

36:57.115 --> 36:58.415
It is.

36:58.417 --> 36:59.349
(engines puttering)

36:59.351 --> 37:00.784
- Is this really appropriate?

37:00.786 --> 37:01.885
I don't think it is.
(doors thudding)

37:01.887 --> 37:02.953
He can barely speak.

37:04.056 --> 37:06.623
(footsteps thudding)
(thugs laughing)

37:06.625 --> 37:07.624
- Ola.
- Oh!

37:11.063 --> 37:12.996
- I thought you said
she wasn't here.

37:14.900 --> 37:19.035
- We are about to have a
lesson, may we offer you food?

37:19.037 --> 37:22.005
- We tried that before,
didn't we, snitch.

37:22.007 --> 37:24.474
- There's no need for violence.

37:24.476 --> 37:28.912
I am Father Elias, I am
the priest of this parish.

37:30.048 --> 37:32.449
I'm sure we can talk this out.

37:34.319 --> 37:37.754
- Mm, you hide
someone from us again,

37:38.924 --> 37:40.790
we make an example
out of you first.

37:42.327 --> 37:43.493
- She stays.

37:45.597 --> 37:46.796
She stays.

37:49.735 --> 37:52.269
Today Father Elias has asked me

37:52.271 --> 37:56.273
to talk to you
about nonviolence.

37:57.809 --> 38:00.176
These men have weapons.

38:00.178 --> 38:02.312
'Cause they like to bully people

38:02.314 --> 38:03.980
and they don't have confidence.

38:06.285 --> 38:07.884
I have no weapons.

38:10.355 --> 38:12.522
But I have confidence.

38:12.524 --> 38:15.325
(thug laughing)

38:15.327 --> 38:19.329
- [Hat] All right now, you take
her, I'll take care of him.

38:19.331 --> 38:20.297
- Don't touch her.

38:21.400 --> 38:22.299
- Oh.

38:23.368 --> 38:26.169
(dramatic music)

38:26.171 --> 38:27.070
New man.

38:30.909 --> 38:32.542
(blows thudding)
(men grunting)

38:32.544 --> 38:35.512
(people screaming)

38:39.318 --> 38:41.351
- [Hat] I'm gonna
fuck you up, priest.

38:41.353 --> 38:46.423
(blows thudding)
(men grunting)

38:48.093 --> 38:50.860
(people screaming)

38:50.862 --> 38:53.296
(body thudding)

38:53.298 --> 38:55.965
(man grunting)

39:02.641 --> 39:03.673
(people whimpering)

39:03.675 --> 39:05.108
- I'm sorry, Father.

39:07.913 --> 39:09.479
- I understand, my son.

39:13.985 --> 39:16.186
- Can you teach me?
- Teach me!

39:16.188 --> 39:17.320
- I want to learn!
- Teach me!

39:17.322 --> 39:19.389
- And me!
- I want to learn!

39:19.391 --> 39:21.925
(ax thudding)

39:21.927 --> 39:23.493
(birds chirping)

39:23.495 --> 39:26.229
- [Elias] That was
very interesting
lesson in nonviolence.

39:27.265 --> 39:29.699
- I apologize for losing
my temper, Father.

39:30.836 --> 39:34.904
- We are all teachers
and students in life.

39:36.641 --> 39:38.675
We all have something to learn

39:38.677 --> 39:42.045
and we've all learned
something we can pass on.

39:43.115 --> 39:46.316
Maybe you could
teach self-defense.

39:46.318 --> 39:47.851
Goodness knows we need it.

39:49.755 --> 39:53.156
- I'm better at attacking
than defending, Father.

39:53.158 --> 39:55.592
- When I brought you
here, that first night,

39:55.594 --> 39:59.729
you were so sick and near
death, I gave you last rites.

40:01.566 --> 40:03.099
I didn't know your religion

40:03.101 --> 40:06.202
or even if you believed
in a God at all.

40:07.506 --> 40:10.540
Maybe something in
you did die that night

40:10.542 --> 40:12.509
and something was reborn.

40:13.845 --> 40:18.782
If you could teach others
to protect themselves,

40:19.818 --> 40:21.017
is it not worthy?

40:23.789 --> 40:25.588
I see so much pain.

40:26.525 --> 40:28.858
I know it is God's will.

40:31.930 --> 40:36.433
But, I also know God wants
us to help ourselves.

40:41.339 --> 40:43.072
(ax thudding)

40:43.074 --> 40:45.875
(dramatic music)

40:48.113 --> 40:49.245
- Just shut up.

40:50.649 --> 40:51.948
What the fuck are
you lookin' at?

41:12.003 --> 41:14.070
- Count to fives, yeah.

41:14.072 --> 41:15.638
Check that one too.

41:15.640 --> 41:16.773
- Shut up!

41:18.643 --> 41:19.542
- So, (groans).

41:23.849 --> 41:25.348
- There were six of 'em boss.

41:26.451 --> 41:30.286
The priests are
very well trained.

41:30.288 --> 41:32.789
- There are only two
priests in that parish.

41:32.791 --> 41:35.191
We know where every
man is within 60 miles.

41:35.193 --> 41:36.259
- They surprised us.

41:41.299 --> 41:44.534
- You think I'm a fuckin' idiot?

41:44.536 --> 41:45.368
- Boss.

41:48.840 --> 41:51.307
- I'm a professional
soldier, yeah?

41:51.309 --> 41:54.711
I select and I train indigenous
forces to kill their own.

41:56.081 --> 41:58.748
This means I have a rare insight
to reading human condition.

41:59.851 --> 42:01.184
You understand?

42:01.186 --> 42:03.653
- Ah, no.

42:03.655 --> 42:06.356
- It means I know when
someone's pissin' on my leg

42:06.358 --> 42:08.224
and telling me it's raining.

42:08.226 --> 42:11.094
- No, fuck this.

42:11.096 --> 42:14.864
There was only one guy, boss,
and he was not a priest.

42:14.866 --> 42:16.199
- Yeah, well that
was fuckin', no.

42:16.201 --> 42:19.335
What. (laughs)

42:19.337 --> 42:21.271
- That, oh no, this is the guy.

42:24.342 --> 42:26.309
That's the guy that
was in the church.

42:28.947 --> 42:31.014
- Well, no, this guy right here,

42:31.016 --> 42:32.549
he would have killed
the both of you two,

42:32.551 --> 42:34.517
real fuckin' quick. (laughs)

42:34.519 --> 42:36.886
Mercy must have left a
bad taste in his mouth.

42:36.888 --> 42:40.223
- That's the guy that I went
toe to toe with, I swear.

42:42.594 --> 42:43.493
- Oh, wow.

42:44.629 --> 42:45.728
All right, guy, will
if a murderer was going

42:45.730 --> 42:47.230
to look for redemption,

42:47.232 --> 42:49.832
I guess a church might be the
right place to go to, yeah.

42:49.834 --> 42:51.434
- Yeah, but we--
- Max?

42:51.436 --> 42:53.503
- He's dead, boss,
we left him for dead.

42:53.505 --> 42:56.005
- Yeah, we left, but we
didn't see him, right?

42:56.007 --> 42:58.841
And now, we do have a problem.

42:59.678 --> 43:02.111
Mm-hmm, all right.

43:09.454 --> 43:10.920
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

43:10.922 --> 43:13.990
- Magpie, put your gun
on the table, please.

43:15.260 --> 43:17.327
You'll be all right,
go on, right there.

43:20.498 --> 43:21.531
(dramatic music)

43:21.533 --> 43:22.432
Yeah.

43:23.969 --> 43:27.937
If you can get that gun
before I can get to mine

43:27.939 --> 43:32.542
and shoot me, well, you'll
have your respect back.

43:32.544 --> 43:34.844
And these boys, they'll
let you live, right guys.

43:36.881 --> 43:37.947
Go on.

43:37.949 --> 43:39.782
- (scoffs) Boss.

43:41.186 --> 43:46.255
- It's your own choice,
mate. (sniffing)

43:46.791 --> 43:49.525
(dramatic music)

43:51.363 --> 43:53.830
(gun firing)

43:55.367 --> 43:57.867
You sloppy, fuckin' lying cunt!

44:00.071 --> 44:01.371
See that?

44:01.373 --> 44:03.272
No exit strategy.

44:03.274 --> 44:04.907
Right, right?

44:06.311 --> 44:08.077
Yeah, but none other, not Max.

44:08.079 --> 44:09.145
What is going on?

44:09.147 --> 44:10.380
What is he up to?

44:10.382 --> 44:12.215
Why is he in my parish?

44:13.251 --> 44:14.751
Anyone, please help?

44:17.288 --> 44:18.187
All right.

44:21.926 --> 44:23.292
We have work to do.

44:24.796 --> 44:25.695
Here.

44:26.931 --> 44:28.698
Shoulder to that, yeah.

44:28.700 --> 44:29.532
- Yes, boss.

44:29.534 --> 44:30.633
- Go ahead, fuck off.

44:33.138 --> 44:38.207
(people grunting)
(dramatic music)

44:56.728 --> 44:59.595
(people grunting)

45:03.868 --> 45:06.803
- So, have you done that a lot?

45:08.273 --> 45:09.906
You know, the whole?

45:09.908 --> 45:14.610
- Father Thiago, whoever Max
was before, he is no longer.

45:14.612 --> 45:16.612
- Yes, of course, I
mean no disrespect.

45:17.716 --> 45:19.482
What I mean to say is,

45:19.484 --> 45:22.018
I may be better with books
than I am with people.

45:22.854 --> 45:24.320
When I saw you,

45:24.322 --> 45:28.458
I didn't see you the way Father
Elias saw you, as a person.

45:29.728 --> 45:32.295
I made a judgment
and I was wrong.

45:34.099 --> 45:35.164
I want to apologize.

45:36.501 --> 45:37.400
- Max.

45:38.236 --> 45:40.803
(tense music)

45:42.474 --> 45:46.409
As I live and breathe,
you live and breathe too.

45:46.411 --> 45:48.244
- I've never seen these people.

45:49.280 --> 45:52.782
Good afternoon,
welcome to my parish.

45:52.784 --> 45:55.952
I am Father Elias, this is
Father Thiago and this--

45:55.954 --> 45:58.187
- And this is one
of my best men.

46:00.658 --> 46:01.924
Oh, he's a killer, yeah.

46:03.094 --> 46:04.327
Best shot I ever had.

46:04.329 --> 46:07.029
Could kill a man from
half a mile away.

46:07.031 --> 46:09.866
Has he told you how he murdered
men, women and children.

46:10.735 --> 46:12.301
Only half of them deserved it.

46:17.375 --> 46:19.976
Well, I'll tell ya,
out of all the places

46:19.978 --> 46:22.578
I thought you might leave me
for, I gotta be honest, mate.

46:22.580 --> 46:23.679
I didn't picture this.

46:23.681 --> 46:26.015
No, no, (laughs) no, no, no.

46:26.017 --> 46:28.584
Tropical fuckin' oil, maybe
some women, yeah sure.

46:30.355 --> 46:33.289
Dying in the gaming pits
in Congo, yeah, sure.

46:34.859 --> 46:35.792
Come on, mate,
you're not foolin'

46:35.794 --> 46:36.659
with this bullshit, are ya?

46:38.263 --> 46:40.696
And I knew you weren't
fuckin' dead, I knew it.

46:43.034 --> 46:45.001
Yeah, getting soft, sure, maybe.

46:45.003 --> 46:47.136
But a priest?

46:51.976 --> 46:53.543
- I'm not a priest.

46:53.545 --> 46:56.312
- There's some things we
can't wash clean now, can we?

46:58.983 --> 47:00.483
- You attacked two of my men.

47:01.853 --> 47:03.886
You know the punishment for
someone hurting one of my men?

47:03.888 --> 47:06.956
Of course you do, you're the
one that used to carry it out.

47:06.958 --> 47:08.424
Look, Max hurt two of my men,

47:08.426 --> 47:11.194
which means I have
to hurt two of yours.

47:11.196 --> 47:13.663
I'll give you a couple of
minutes to make a decision.

47:13.665 --> 47:17.066
- As a regional
representative of the church,

47:17.068 --> 47:20.703
I have to inform you, that
your threats are a violation

47:20.705 --> 47:22.071
to the National Civics Charter--

47:22.073 --> 47:25.374
- As the regional representative
of the Silver Cartel,

47:25.376 --> 47:28.144
I'd like to formally
apologize, Father.

47:28.146 --> 47:29.779
I didn't intend on our
first meeting ending

47:29.781 --> 47:30.847
with me killing you.

47:33.618 --> 47:35.218
- You're fight is
not here, LeClerc.

47:35.220 --> 47:36.252
- Why are you fuckin' here?

47:36.254 --> 47:37.720
There's always a reason, mate.

47:37.722 --> 47:39.989
I know you, there's
always a fuckin' reason.

47:41.359 --> 47:44.393
- I'm just doing what I have
to do to forget my past.

47:44.395 --> 47:45.928
- Now wait a minute, mate.

47:48.066 --> 47:50.566
You're not here
to see me, are ya?

47:50.568 --> 47:51.801
- LeClerc, brother.

47:51.803 --> 47:54.737
- Say the word, I'll
make him my next notch.

47:54.739 --> 47:56.239
- No, no, it's all good.

47:57.375 --> 47:58.674
All right, tell you what.

48:00.211 --> 48:01.577
I'll let all of this slide

48:01.579 --> 48:03.679
if Max joins me for
dinner tonight, yeah?

48:05.650 --> 48:06.782
What do you say, mate?

48:06.784 --> 48:08.618
Good food, good drinks,
we can sit down,

48:08.620 --> 48:10.152
have a nice civil conversation

48:10.154 --> 48:12.688
and maybe try to figure this
whole thing out, right, Max?

48:14.559 --> 48:15.758
Tonight at 8:00.

48:17.595 --> 48:21.564
Father, Father. (sighs)

48:23.835 --> 48:25.468
Whoever the fuck you are, mate.

48:27.338 --> 48:30.172
(dramatic music)

48:37.882 --> 48:40.616
(snaps popping)

48:41.686 --> 48:42.818
- What are you doing?

48:46.391 --> 48:47.757
- I shouldn't have stayed.

48:49.060 --> 48:52.962
- If you hadn't helped
that child they wanted,

48:52.964 --> 48:54.196
she would be dead.

48:57.468 --> 49:01.404
Max, you have given
the people hope here.

49:02.507 --> 49:03.806
Do you realize that?

49:04.909 --> 49:06.943
Please, stay.

49:08.413 --> 49:09.679
We need you.

49:11.382 --> 49:16.118
- If I stay, Father, all
of you are in danger.

49:17.622 --> 49:18.721
- So what can we do?

49:19.791 --> 49:22.124
You're a new man, maybe
you can talk to him

49:22.126 --> 49:23.693
and not fight him.

49:27.765 --> 49:28.664
- Good, good, good.

49:31.769 --> 49:34.603
(dramatic music)

49:42.814 --> 49:44.847
- Hey, gringo! (laughs)

49:44.849 --> 49:48.851
(speaking in foreign language)

49:53.191 --> 49:55.858
(men laughing)

49:58.363 --> 50:01.097
- When they told me,
I didn't believe it.

50:01.099 --> 50:03.966
Reverend Max, a
fuckin' false prophet.

50:07.271 --> 50:08.170
Stop.

50:09.707 --> 50:10.706
You know the drill.

50:13.578 --> 50:15.478
You know, I've seen
you cave a man's head

50:15.480 --> 50:16.912
in with a shovel, Max.

50:18.883 --> 50:21.817
God has a special place
for sinners like us.

50:23.121 --> 50:26.489
It ain't wearin' a backward
front collar. (laughs)

50:28.793 --> 50:31.627
(dramatic music)

50:37.635 --> 50:38.601
(door thudding)

50:38.603 --> 50:39.835
- There's five Gs, count that.

50:40.972 --> 50:42.972
There's another
five Gs, roll it up.

50:42.974 --> 50:45.841
- [Hammaford] The Right
Reverend Max to see you, sir.

50:45.843 --> 50:47.777
- Always punctual, right, Max.

50:49.947 --> 50:51.914
Come on, have a seat, Max.

50:51.916 --> 50:54.150
Isabel, bring me that
bottle, will ya, love.

50:55.953 --> 50:58.954
Mm, right.

51:00.358 --> 51:02.892
Thank you,
sweetheart, very nice.

51:05.063 --> 51:08.564
Well, crab meat's all fresh.

51:08.566 --> 51:10.666
Listen, I'm really showin'
what you wanted to eat, sir,

51:10.668 --> 51:12.134
it's all your choice, mate.

51:12.136 --> 51:13.035
- I'm not hungry.

51:14.739 --> 51:15.971
- Now listen to that.

51:15.973 --> 51:17.306
That's a little fuckin'
rude, don't you think?

51:19.377 --> 51:21.644
I did invite you for
dinner, didn't I?

51:21.646 --> 51:22.878
And all this, guy.

51:23.915 --> 51:24.747
What am I meant to do?

51:24.749 --> 51:26.549
Eat it all myself?

51:26.551 --> 51:30.453
Make me look like a fuckin'
idiot, yeah, all right.

51:31.389 --> 51:34.123
(LeClerc sighs)

51:35.460 --> 51:37.359
Do you by chance remember
that one night, mate?

51:38.563 --> 51:40.796
We barbecued that
javelina in Juarez?

51:42.100 --> 51:43.933
Best fuckin' meal I've ever had.

51:43.935 --> 51:48.270
Til this fuckin' day, the best
meal I've ever had. (laughs)

51:51.976 --> 51:53.742
Oh, it's a good drop.

51:57.181 --> 51:58.047
Yeah.

52:05.990 --> 52:07.990
- What do you want from me?

52:09.460 --> 52:10.292
- Come on, mate.

52:10.294 --> 52:12.428
We're gettin' old, Max.

52:12.430 --> 52:14.029
You know how it goes, mate.

52:14.031 --> 52:16.665
Tick fuckin' tock, boom.

52:16.667 --> 52:18.868
No more chasin' those
high-value targets.

52:18.870 --> 52:21.036
It's a young man's game that is.

52:21.038 --> 52:22.905
Here, I mean look at us, mate.

52:22.907 --> 52:24.773
We get to kill with impunity.

52:24.775 --> 52:27.376
Only one fuckin' spot and
the money's fuckin' good.

52:28.146 --> 52:29.211
Really fuckin' good.

52:31.249 --> 52:33.282
Come back and join
the team, mate.

52:37.722 --> 52:40.122
- I'm sorry I hurt your men.

52:42.994 --> 52:45.161
I'd like to
apologize about that.

52:45.163 --> 52:47.463
- Just fuckin' go on, will ya.

52:47.465 --> 52:48.430
I don't give a fuck about him.

52:48.432 --> 52:49.999
Not a problem.

52:50.001 --> 52:52.701
But the big boss, yeah, he's
askin' questions, all right.

52:53.538 --> 52:55.037
I mean, come on, Max.

52:55.039 --> 52:56.572
You can't just go beat the shit
out of two cartel men, mate.

52:56.574 --> 52:58.307
What do you think, there's
no show of rules, mate.

52:58.309 --> 53:00.676
Respect is everything, you
know that better than anyone.

53:00.678 --> 53:01.944
Make me look fuckin' weak,

53:01.946 --> 53:03.812
you make the cartel
look weak and so on.

53:04.815 --> 53:05.714
Fuckin' so on.

53:06.817 --> 53:08.717
You either join the team,

53:08.719 --> 53:11.287
or you leave fuckin'
town, it's that simple.

53:12.690 --> 53:14.757
- This is not who I am anymore.

53:16.260 --> 53:18.127
I want to live a simple life.

53:20.164 --> 53:24.533
And the people at the church,
they're not your enemies.

53:26.270 --> 53:28.037
They don't want
to fight you guys.

53:31.542 --> 53:35.411
I'll leave tonight and you'll
never have to see me again.

53:35.413 --> 53:37.613
- Fuck!

53:37.615 --> 53:39.915
What, is, fuckin', oh mate,

53:39.917 --> 53:42.284
I don't, I don't,
for the church.

53:42.286 --> 53:43.752
You're all for the
fuckin' church.

53:43.754 --> 53:46.655
- Can you promise me you won't
hurt them while I'm gone?

53:47.992 --> 53:50.392
- Yeah, all right,
fuckin' go, you're done.

53:50.394 --> 53:52.027
Get out of here.

53:52.029 --> 53:54.830
(dramatic music)

53:54.832 --> 53:56.298
- I'm beggin' you, please.

53:56.300 --> 53:58.867
- Yeah, yeah, mate, no problems.

54:04.875 --> 54:06.642
- I can't believe
what I just saw.

54:07.712 --> 54:10.546
The great Max,
turn into a sheep.

54:10.548 --> 54:12.281
- [Hammaford] No, I always
knew he was a coward.

54:12.283 --> 54:14.783
- [Notch] Let me fight
him, I'm better than he is.

54:14.785 --> 54:16.252
- That's not the Max I knew.

54:16.254 --> 54:18.220
We don't know where he's
going, who he's talking to.

54:18.222 --> 54:19.888
- Yeah, well first
of all I fuckin' know

54:19.890 --> 54:22.591
and second of all, who said
you could fuckin' sit here!

54:22.593 --> 54:24.493
You think this fuckin'
thing's for you?

54:24.495 --> 54:25.761
No, get out!

54:25.763 --> 54:27.596
Get everyone, get
to fuckin' work.

54:27.598 --> 54:28.931
We'll take care of Maxie.

54:30.067 --> 54:32.901
(dramatic music)

54:37.575 --> 54:40.576
- You can keep the sandals, Max.

54:40.578 --> 54:43.746
- You can give them to the
next person who needs them.

54:43.748 --> 54:45.381
- I don't think you should go.

54:45.383 --> 54:46.649
We need you.

54:46.651 --> 54:49.084
- I made a deal with
LeClerc and his men.

54:49.086 --> 54:50.686
They won't hurt you if I go.

54:50.688 --> 54:54.590
- Absolutely not, I won't
let you leave this way.

54:54.592 --> 54:56.292
- This is what I am, Father.

54:57.628 --> 54:58.994
(men shouting)

54:58.996 --> 55:00.462
- [Thiago] Who's that?

55:00.464 --> 55:02.731
(men shouting)

55:02.733 --> 55:04.500
- [Max] The son of
a bitch, stay here.

55:05.469 --> 55:07.303
(dramatic music)

55:07.305 --> 55:08.270
(door clicking)

55:08.272 --> 55:09.538
- There he is.
- Hey, Max.

55:09.540 --> 55:10.639
- Don't move or I'll kill her.

55:10.641 --> 55:12.441
You know I will, don't you, Max.

55:12.443 --> 55:13.776
- LeClerc, you promised.

55:13.778 --> 55:15.311
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I know I did, Max.

55:15.313 --> 55:17.479
But see, I got
thinkin', you know,

55:17.481 --> 55:19.948
started rolling it over
and over in my head.

55:19.950 --> 55:22.284
And I realized something, mate.

55:22.286 --> 55:24.453
I realized I don't
need the priests,

55:24.455 --> 55:27.790
I don't need the church and
I don't fuckin' need you.

55:27.792 --> 55:31.293
(blow thudding)
(men yelling)

55:31.295 --> 55:33.295
(blow thudding)

55:33.297 --> 55:34.730
- Hit him, Wilson, hit him!

55:36.934 --> 55:38.967
- Kill him!
- Get him up!

55:38.969 --> 55:39.935
- Give into him.

55:39.937 --> 55:43.639
(blows thudding)
(men grunting)

55:43.641 --> 55:46.975
(men laughing)
(blows thudding)

55:46.977 --> 55:49.678
Let's fuckin' string this
cunt right up, come on.

55:50.581 --> 55:51.847
(men chattering)

55:51.849 --> 55:54.616
- Dirty bastard.
- Oh, come on.

55:54.618 --> 55:57.252
(man groaning)

55:59.957 --> 56:01.657
- [LeClerc] Hey Max.

56:03.527 --> 56:05.427
- You betrayed me
twice, brother.

56:05.429 --> 56:10.499
- Yeah, well, the Lord
protect me from my friends.

56:11.302 --> 56:13.202
My enemies I can handle, yeah.

56:14.705 --> 56:16.505
(eerie music)

56:16.507 --> 56:17.573
(laughing) Put him up.

56:17.575 --> 56:19.541
Come on, put him up!

56:19.543 --> 56:21.510
(Max groaning)

56:21.512 --> 56:23.078
And he's up, you want to
put the first one in him.

56:23.080 --> 56:27.049
- Oh, it would be my pleasure.
- Got one.

56:27.051 --> 56:28.384
(men laughing)

56:28.386 --> 56:29.284
Hold him tight!

56:30.388 --> 56:31.820
(hammer thudding)
(Max screaming)

56:31.822 --> 56:33.555
Give me your nail, Dix.

56:33.557 --> 56:35.958
Give me one, give
me the next one.

56:37.361 --> 56:40.496
(hammer thudding)
(Max screaming)

56:40.498 --> 56:43.132
(men laughing)

56:44.468 --> 56:46.268
Yeah, good job, boys.

56:47.171 --> 56:48.003
All right, let's move.

56:48.005 --> 56:49.071
Hang in there, Max.

56:51.709 --> 56:53.575
I'm sorry, Max, I
really am, mate.

56:53.577 --> 56:56.612
At the end of the day, it
is just business, yeah.

56:58.649 --> 57:00.849
I'll see you around, brother.

57:02.987 --> 57:05.020
(Max groaning)

57:05.022 --> 57:08.323
(engine puttering)

57:08.325 --> 57:10.159
- [Wilson] Goddam, you drive
like a fuckin' grandma.

57:10.161 --> 57:11.627
- [LeClerc] Park it up at
the head of the church there.

57:11.629 --> 57:12.961
- [Notch] Move it on, boys,
we don't have all night.

57:12.963 --> 57:15.431
We've got work to do.

57:15.433 --> 57:17.566
(men grunting)

57:17.568 --> 57:20.402
(dramatic music)

57:22.940 --> 57:28.010
(Max screaming)
(flesh tearing)

57:38.022 --> 57:38.887
(body thudding)

57:38.889 --> 57:43.926
- Go!
(guns firing)

58:02.746 --> 58:04.780
- The fire of the
Lord is smokin',

58:04.782 --> 58:07.382
his mystery's been unveiled.

58:07.384 --> 58:09.818
- Hammaford, send in
the 40 millimeter late.

58:11.722 --> 58:13.822
(Max groaning)

58:13.824 --> 58:16.792
(explosion booming)

58:16.794 --> 58:17.993
(man laughing)

58:17.995 --> 58:19.294
- Man, I've been
waitin' to do that.

58:19.296 --> 58:20.629
- Let's move!
- Go baby!

58:20.631 --> 58:22.498
(men shouting)

58:22.500 --> 58:24.433
(quiet triumphant music)

58:24.435 --> 58:27.069
(Max groaning)

58:48.125 --> 58:49.458
- Father Elias!

58:52.630 --> 58:54.429
- Thank God, you're alive.

58:54.431 --> 58:55.664
Can you stand?

58:56.467 --> 58:57.866
Max, come, come.

59:01.972 --> 59:04.806
(birds chirping)

59:11.749 --> 59:13.515
I wasn't sure you'd wake up.

59:14.318 --> 59:17.719
- The church, I'm sorry, Father.

59:17.721 --> 59:19.688
- I have some more broth.

59:22.927 --> 59:26.328
They killed Esther and
the two groundskeepers.

59:27.598 --> 59:30.332
- I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

59:30.334 --> 59:33.268
- Father Thiago and
I escaped to here.

59:34.672 --> 59:37.239
He went to bring
you clean clothes.

59:38.375 --> 59:41.877
I have faith we can
rebuild the church.

59:42.746 --> 59:43.812
Continue what we started.

59:47.618 --> 59:50.519
- [Max] His men will
kill you, Father.

59:50.521 --> 59:51.720
You can't go back.

59:53.357 --> 59:56.458
- Then I will die
doing God's work.

59:57.328 --> 01:00:02.397
(gentle music)
(birds chirping)

01:00:17.514 --> 01:00:21.283
Father Thiago says raids
are happening every day

01:00:21.285 --> 01:00:22.417
in the village now.

01:00:23.554 --> 01:00:26.488
They are rounding
up people to kidnap

01:00:26.490 --> 01:00:30.225
to work in the jungle
factories or just kill.

01:00:31.562 --> 01:00:33.495
It is a reign of terror.

01:00:33.497 --> 01:00:36.298
- 'Cause the church was
inspiring people to fight back.

01:00:40.371 --> 01:00:43.605
- The people in the
village are victims.

01:00:43.607 --> 01:00:44.806
They're terrified.

01:00:47.044 --> 01:00:48.744
- I will go back now.

01:00:48.746 --> 01:00:50.712
It's best I move at night.

01:00:50.714 --> 01:00:52.414
- God be with you,
Father Thiago.

01:00:59.757 --> 01:01:02.524
- Would've been better
if I'd just died, Father.

01:01:02.526 --> 01:01:04.092
- No, Max, listen.

01:01:05.229 --> 01:01:08.897
When God saw you try
to live peacefully,

01:01:10.034 --> 01:01:12.501
he smiled on it for a time.

01:01:14.571 --> 01:01:18.774
Then he visited fire and
brimstone down on us.

01:01:21.578 --> 01:01:24.780
Maybe that's the message, huh?

01:01:28.318 --> 01:01:32.988
You are a weapon,
Max, forged in fire.

01:01:35.659 --> 01:01:40.395
You might be the only thing
that can stop what's happening.

01:01:44.034 --> 01:01:49.071
Maybe you should do God's work
the best way you know how.

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:53.075
(quiet tense music)

01:02:04.655 --> 01:02:07.222
(Max hissing)

01:02:15.766 --> 01:02:18.400
(Max groaning)

01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:24.539
(quiet tense music)
(Max grunting)

01:02:28.512 --> 01:02:31.079
(Max yelling)

01:02:46.730 --> 01:02:49.397
(gun clicking)

01:03:06.784 --> 01:03:09.384
(Max sighing)

01:03:09.386 --> 01:03:12.921
(bones creaking)

01:03:12.923 --> 01:03:16.057
Are you sure you are fit to run?

01:03:16.059 --> 01:03:18.026
- Have to get fit
to fight, Father.

01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:22.030
- I wish there was a better way.

01:03:22.866 --> 01:03:25.567
(birds chirping)

01:03:25.569 --> 01:03:28.136
(tense music)

01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:42.217
- [Notch] Look it here.

01:03:42.219 --> 01:03:44.519
- Location, location, location.

01:03:44.521 --> 01:03:47.389
- No shit!
- Welcome, my friends.

01:03:47.391 --> 01:03:49.224
- What the fuck
are you doin' here?

01:03:49.226 --> 01:03:51.293
This where you keep the
little boys, Father?

01:03:51.295 --> 01:03:52.227
(man laughs)

01:03:52.229 --> 01:03:53.962
- This is my spiritual retreat.

01:03:53.964 --> 01:03:56.598
I come here to meditate,
to find solace.

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:58.867
- This place is a
fuckin' shit hole.

01:03:58.869 --> 01:04:02.003
- God does not see it that way.

01:04:02.005 --> 01:04:04.840
I am preparing some
soup, delicious.

01:04:04.842 --> 01:04:07.108
- Oh, we just ate.
- I ate too.

01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:08.176
- Don't want soup?

01:04:09.179 --> 01:04:10.312
- Don't fuckin' move.

01:04:12.749 --> 01:04:14.482
- Bread, huh?

01:04:14.484 --> 01:04:15.851
Everybody likes bread.

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:19.688
(guns firing)

01:04:20.891 --> 01:04:23.091
(birds squawking)

01:04:23.093 --> 01:04:24.459
- Told you not to move.

01:04:25.262 --> 01:04:26.161
Oh shit.

01:04:27.865 --> 01:04:29.531
He was just going for his bread.

01:04:30.701 --> 01:04:32.734
Looks like we're both
going to hell, brother.

01:04:32.736 --> 01:04:33.034
Fuckin' eh.

01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:38.807
- (sniffs) Never
did like priests.

01:04:39.943 --> 01:04:42.744
(dramatic music)

01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:51.686
- No, no, no!

01:04:53.523 --> 01:04:55.323
(Max gasping)

01:04:55.325 --> 01:04:56.224
Father.

01:05:04.001 --> 01:05:07.068
(footsteps tapping)

01:05:09.573 --> 01:05:12.140
(Max sobbing)

01:05:19.917 --> 01:05:24.986
(tense music)
(birds chirping)

01:05:28.792 --> 01:05:32.861
- [Elias] You are a weapon,
Max, forged in fire.

01:05:35.699 --> 01:05:40.302
You might be the only thing
that can stop what's happening.

01:05:42.706 --> 01:05:45.273
Maybe you should do God's work

01:05:48.946 --> 01:05:51.179
the best way you know how.

01:05:53.717 --> 01:05:56.718
(engine puttering)

01:06:00.257 --> 01:06:03.525
(men laughing)

01:06:03.527 --> 01:06:08.096
(people speaking in
foreign language)

01:06:24.414 --> 01:06:26.614
(gun clicking)

01:06:26.616 --> 01:06:30.919
(men speaking in
foreign language)

01:06:32.055 --> 01:06:34.289
(gun firing)
(body thudding)

01:06:34.291 --> 01:06:38.593
(men speaking in
foreign language)

01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:43.531
(gun firing)
(men groaning)

01:06:43.533 --> 01:06:45.500
(gun clicking)

01:06:45.502 --> 01:06:46.368
(speaking in foreign language)

01:06:46.370 --> 01:06:49.170
(glass crashing)

01:06:51.208 --> 01:06:52.774
(gun clicking)

01:06:52.776 --> 01:06:57.712
(guns firing)
(men groaning)

01:06:57.714 --> 01:06:59.014

01:06:59.016 --> 01:07:04.019
(blows thudding)
(men groaning)

01:07:18.168 --> 01:07:20.668
(men moaning)

01:07:20.670 --> 01:07:23.505
(dramatic music)

01:07:45.328 --> 01:07:47.729
(Max sighs)

01:07:57.808 --> 01:08:00.742
(woman whimpering)

01:08:04.014 --> 01:08:06.815
(birds chirping)

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:11.820
(men grunting)
(blows thudding)

01:08:11.822 --> 01:08:12.787
(guns firing)

01:08:12.789 --> 01:08:17.759
(blows thudding)
(men groaning)

01:08:28.971 --> 01:08:31.439
(gun firing)

01:08:34.743 --> 01:08:39.814
(blows thudding)
(men groaning)

01:09:01.705 --> 01:09:04.606
(blood splashing)

01:09:11.781 --> 01:09:13.747
- Wait a minute, just
slow down, will ya.

01:09:13.750 --> 01:09:14.649
Eight men?

01:09:16.153 --> 01:09:18.051
Nine, nine men?

01:09:19.456 --> 01:09:21.456
- They were shot with high
velocity big game rounds.

01:09:21.457 --> 01:09:23.825
Shots came from
outside and inside.

01:09:23.827 --> 01:09:28.029
Others were killed with
blades, a machete maybe.

01:09:29.265 --> 01:09:30.631
Accurate strikes.

01:09:31.434 --> 01:09:32.834
It was a professional.

01:09:34.904 --> 01:09:39.974
A very, very skilled
professional.

01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:41.376
- Find him!

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:45.513
(phone thuds)

01:09:45.515 --> 01:09:48.383
Must be Max, it doesn't
make any fuckin' sense.

01:09:48.385 --> 01:09:51.252
- You had the chance
to kill him up close.

01:09:51.254 --> 01:09:53.154
But you chose to
do it at a distance

01:09:53.156 --> 01:09:55.156
because you couldn't face him.

01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:58.726
This mistake's on you, LeClerc.

01:09:58.728 --> 01:09:59.961
- Come on mate, you were there.

01:09:59.963 --> 01:10:01.796
You saw his body in
the chapel, right,

01:10:01.798 --> 01:10:02.730
I mean you were there.

01:10:02.732 --> 01:10:04.632
We blew the fuckin' church up!

01:10:04.634 --> 01:10:05.867
- With a guy like Max,

01:10:05.869 --> 01:10:08.570
you actually have to cut
his fuckin' head off!

01:10:09.673 --> 01:10:11.306
You're losin' your
touch, LeClerc.

01:10:12.642 --> 01:10:14.842
- Yeah, well, maybe you're right
about cutting his head off.

01:10:14.844 --> 01:10:17.245
Mm-hmm, yeah, but.

01:10:18.615 --> 01:10:22.984
If you ever fuckin' tell me
how to run my business again,

01:10:22.986 --> 01:10:24.619
and I'm gonna fuckin'
eviscerate you.

01:10:24.621 --> 01:10:26.254
So help me fuckin' God.

01:10:27.591 --> 01:10:29.591
What I say when I say
you get rich you're done,

01:10:29.593 --> 01:10:30.858
ya fuckin' die.

01:10:32.329 --> 01:10:34.128
Do you understand.

01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:36.431
- Yeah. (groaning)

01:10:36.433 --> 01:10:39.000
(man gasping)

01:10:42.305 --> 01:10:47.342
(dramatic music)
(engine puttering)

01:11:10.967 --> 01:11:15.203
(man singing in
foreign language)

01:11:18.008 --> 01:11:22.310
(men speaking in
foreign language)

01:11:23.246 --> 01:11:28.316
- Don't move.

01:11:29.619 --> 01:11:32.420
(dramatic music)

01:11:35.992 --> 01:11:41.062
(blows thudding)
(men grunting)

01:11:47.203 --> 01:11:49.671
(gun clicks)

01:11:50.573 --> 01:11:52.807
- This is not your fight.

01:11:52.809 --> 01:11:53.908
No need to die.

01:11:55.111 --> 01:11:59.113
If you pick up that
pistol, I will kill you.

01:12:04.054 --> 01:12:08.189
(gun firing)
(men groaning)

01:12:08.191 --> 01:12:10.992
(dramatic music)

01:12:18.868 --> 01:12:21.936
(engines puttering)

01:12:31.781 --> 01:12:34.582
(man vocalizing)

01:12:49.833 --> 01:12:51.632
(LeClerc sighs)

01:12:51.634 --> 01:12:53.735
- Forget it, he's long gone.

01:12:55.038 --> 01:12:57.271
He's not here, he's
close but he's not here.

01:12:58.541 --> 01:12:59.374
Come on Tex, talk to me.

01:12:59.376 --> 01:13:00.608
Did he say anything?

01:13:00.610 --> 01:13:02.276
- They came 'cause
of the gunshots.

01:13:02.278 --> 01:13:05.079
He was long gone by
the time they got here.

01:13:05.081 --> 01:13:06.314
He shot these two

01:13:06.316 --> 01:13:07.982
and he kicked the shit
out of these others.

01:13:09.252 --> 01:13:10.251
- You didn't say
anything, right.

01:13:10.253 --> 01:13:11.652
- No.

01:13:11.654 --> 01:13:12.553
- You know, why would ya.

01:13:14.424 --> 01:13:15.556
Come with me.

01:13:24.367 --> 01:13:25.266
- Oh.

01:13:26.403 --> 01:13:29.170
(pin clicks)

01:13:29.172 --> 01:13:30.338
Piss!

01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:32.907
(explosion booming)
(men groaning)

01:13:32.909 --> 01:13:34.242
- [Hammaford] Magpie!

01:13:34.244 --> 01:13:37.044
(dramatic music)

01:13:41.518 --> 01:13:43.184
- Keep it together.

01:13:48.491 --> 01:13:51.859
(gun clicking)

01:13:51.861 --> 01:13:54.295
(gun firing)

01:13:54.297 --> 01:13:55.596
Where is he?

01:13:55.598 --> 01:13:57.932
(gun firing)
(men groaning)

01:13:57.934 --> 01:13:59.100
Notch, cover fire!

01:13:59.102 --> 01:14:01.702
Everybody else, take positions.

01:14:01.704 --> 01:14:05.006
(tense music)

01:14:05.008 --> 01:14:07.108
(gun firing)

01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:08.209
(guns clicking)

01:14:08.211 --> 01:14:10.778
(guns firing)

01:14:16.286 --> 01:14:18.286
- Where the fuck is he?

01:14:19.389 --> 01:14:21.489
He killed Magpie, the
motherfucker killed her.

01:14:21.491 --> 01:14:22.690
- Yeah, I know, I tell ya what.

01:14:22.692 --> 01:14:24.025
Anyone who kills this
piece of shit gets

01:14:24.027 --> 01:14:26.160
an extra 100 grand
bonus tonight.

01:14:26.162 --> 01:14:29.397
Right, we know he's
here, we know he's alone.

01:14:29.399 --> 01:14:30.932
Let's fuckin' find him.

01:14:30.934 --> 01:14:32.567
I have a feeling he might
even come looking for us.

01:14:32.569 --> 01:14:33.868
- [Hammaford]
Where to now, boss.

01:14:33.870 --> 01:14:35.636
- Back to the saloon,
let's move, now!

01:14:37.707 --> 01:14:39.407
(speaking in foreign language)

01:14:39.409 --> 01:14:42.410
(engine puttering)

01:14:43.346 --> 01:14:45.880
(dramatic music)

01:14:45.882 --> 01:14:48.583
I want 10 men out here
at all times, okay.

01:14:48.585 --> 01:14:50.284
No one gets in there
unless I say so.

01:14:50.286 --> 01:14:51.419
You got it?

01:14:51.421 --> 01:14:52.820
(speaking in foreign language)
Good!

01:14:52.822 --> 01:14:54.455
(dramatic music)

01:14:54.457 --> 01:14:57.658
(speaking in foreign language)

01:14:57.660 --> 01:14:59.927
- Ted, over there.

01:14:59.929 --> 01:15:01.429
- Had to be fuckin'
Mexico, that's right,

01:15:01.431 --> 01:15:03.364
couldn't have been one of
you fuckin' blokes here.

01:15:03.366 --> 01:15:05.233
Could have killed one of
you in a fuckin' heartbeat.

01:15:05.235 --> 01:15:07.702
- 15 years on a SEAL team,
boss, we don't die so easy.

01:15:07.704 --> 01:15:08.836
- Oh yeah, really.

01:15:08.838 --> 01:15:10.204
- He's been lucky, boss.

01:15:10.206 --> 01:15:13.574
But not today, today is his day.

01:15:13.576 --> 01:15:14.942
- Today is his fuckin' day.

01:15:14.944 --> 01:15:16.277
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

01:15:16.279 --> 01:15:17.778
That 100 grand's mine.

01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:20.781
- Fuck your grudge and
fuck your 100 grand.

01:15:20.783 --> 01:15:22.016
He killed Magpie.

01:15:22.018 --> 01:15:22.850
(gun clicks)

01:15:22.852 --> 01:15:24.018
He's mine.

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:25.953
- Oh, not unless
I get him first.

01:15:25.955 --> 01:15:28.022
And this time, I will
chop his fuckin' head off

01:15:28.024 --> 01:15:29.790
so he doesn't come
back yet again.

01:15:29.792 --> 01:15:31.859
And I'll put it outside
on a fuckin' post.

01:15:31.861 --> 01:15:33.327
- Good.
- Yeah, well if

01:15:33.329 --> 01:15:35.263
he is stupid enough to come
back, we will kill him.

01:15:35.265 --> 01:15:37.532
- All right, Wilson,
inside front door.

01:15:37.534 --> 01:15:39.033
Hammaford, inside here.

01:15:39.035 --> 01:15:40.835
Notch, Rodriguez,
you're with me.

01:15:41.938 --> 01:15:43.271
Oh, you fuckin'
never die, do ya.

01:15:43.273 --> 01:15:44.772
All right, Willie
Nelson with a gun.

01:15:44.774 --> 01:15:45.740
Let's go, come on.

01:15:47.076 --> 01:15:49.877
(dramatic music)

01:15:53.716 --> 01:15:57.451
(brakes squeaking)

01:15:57.453 --> 01:16:01.689
(man speaking in
foreign language)

01:16:06.162 --> 01:16:07.428
- I'd like to surrender.

01:16:09.566 --> 01:16:12.833
(man speaking in
foreign language)

01:16:12.835 --> 01:16:15.403
- You're gonna make me a
rich man, son of a bitch.

01:16:19.576 --> 01:16:22.310
(phone ringing)

01:16:23.313 --> 01:16:25.713
(man sighs)

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:32.486
- Yeah, go on.

01:16:32.488 --> 01:16:33.821
- [Notch] Hey boss,
they found him.

01:16:33.823 --> 01:16:35.122
They're pullin' up
in jeep outside.

01:16:35.124 --> 01:16:36.824
- Well, wait a
minute, who's got him?

01:16:36.826 --> 01:16:38.059
One of ours?

01:16:38.061 --> 01:16:39.026
- [Notch] Yeah, it's
Jose, the fat one.

01:16:39.028 --> 01:16:40.394
- Dead or alive?
- He's alive.

01:16:40.396 --> 01:16:41.963
- Oh you fuckin' idiots.

01:16:41.965 --> 01:16:46.434
Stop the car and kill him,
right fuckin' now, immediately!

01:16:46.436 --> 01:16:47.768
They're all fuckin' dead.

01:16:51.341 --> 01:16:54.342
(engine puttering)

01:16:58.448 --> 01:17:00.915
- From here on, I
go in on my own.

01:17:00.917 --> 01:17:01.882
- (huffs) Shut up.

01:17:02.752 --> 01:17:04.118
(dramatic music)
(blows thudding)

01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:06.787

(dramatic music)

01:18:11.654 --> 01:18:12.787

01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:17.058
(explosion booming)

01:18:18.661 --> 01:18:21.362
