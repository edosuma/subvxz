03:14.080 --> 03:17.709
_ _ You assured me
thlS Chinatown squad was the answer,

03:17.840 --> 03:18.977
but now we have gangs

03:19.080 --> 03:20.707
murdering each other out in the open.

03:20.800 --> 03:23.018
The squad is a public relations hit
on all fronts,

03:23.120 --> 03:26.146
and I am heading over to Chinatown
to make sure it stays that way.

03:26.720 --> 03:28.506
But it would take a small army
to establish

03:28.600 --> 03:30.864
true law and order in Chinatown.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.746
Well, we don't have an army,

03:32.840 --> 03:34.705
so we're going to
need another solution.

03:34.800 --> 03:36.540
The Exclusion Act is the solution,

03:36.640 --> 03:38.619
and Crestwood
is the man to deliver it.

03:38.720 --> 03:40.062
If we do right by him,

03:40.160 --> 03:41.787
we'll have an ally in the White House.

03:41.880 --> 03:44.747
But not if I don't back
his play against the Chinese.

03:44.840 --> 03:46.979
I think it's time you took a stand.
Don't you?

03:48.520 --> 03:51.159
The senator needs to see
who his friends are.

03:52.440 --> 03:55.420
Frankly, I'm not sure
you have a choice.

03:55.520 --> 03:58.626
The violence is growing.
It's become a national story.

03:58.720 --> 04:00.585
(LAUGHS) We've got
a couple of dead hatchetmen.

04:00.680 --> 04:02.341
It's hardly a civic disaster.

04:02.440 --> 04:04.419
Eleven dead hatchetmen,

04:04.520 --> 04:06.340
and many more wounded, I'm told.

are Hop Wei

Pleasure to meet you, Sergeant.

05:01.840 --> 05:03.467
What can I dO for you, Senator?

05:03.560 --> 05:06.302
Your, uh, Chinatown troubles
have caught the ear Of Sacramento.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.140
I'm here to see how we can help.

05:08.240 --> 05:09.559
Got a shovel?

05:10.960 --> 05:13.099
What can you tell me
about this latest incident?

05:13.200 --> 05:16.419
Two gangs. Eleven dead. NO suspects.

05:16.520 --> 05:18.465
This is the fourth such
incidence of violence

05:18.560 --> 05:20.664

In as many weeks, am I rIght?

05:20.760 --> 05:22.580
We don't really keep count.

05:22.680 --> 05:25.183
Obviously, this can't continue.

05:25.280 --> 05:28.260
Lawlessness, murder,
something must be done.

05:30.120 --> 05:32.304
The Chinese in San Francisco

05:32.400 --> 05:35.301
have shown no regard for the laws
Of our great nation,

05:35.400 --> 05:38.221
even as they avail themselves
Of its freedoms and Opportunities.

05:38.840 --> 05:40.785
We have been forced to expand
our police presence

05:40.880 --> 05:42.984
just to contain the violence.

05:43.080 --> 05:45.059
And who bears the cost
Of such measures?

05:45.160 --> 05:47.469
California's taxpayers.

05:47.560 --> 05:49.460
Honest, law-abiding citizens.

05:49.560 --> 05:51.824
This isn't a local problem,
it's a national one.

05:51.920 --> 05:54.059
Congress must staunch the flow
Of Chinese

05:54.160 --> 05:55.297
into our ports immediately.

05:56.400 --> 05:57.662
Fung Hai.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.980

at the parade, I reckon.

06:04.320 --> 06:05.309
Whatever's going on here,

06:05.400 --> 06:06.901
it's more complicated
than a gang fight.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.137
What do you think?

06:09.080 --> 06:10.820
They don't pay us enough to think.

06:24.760 --> 06:26.705
That was a fucking blood jam!

06:26.800 --> 06:28.745
We had them running
like scared little bitches. (CHUCKLES)

06:28.840 --> 06:32.139
The Long Zii broke the truce
and attacked us in our own bowl.

06:32.240 --> 06:33.901

six months ago.

06:35.400 --> 06:39.063

couldn't see past her tits,

06:46.400 --> 06:48.743

06:55.280 --> 06:57.942
He wants to know if you
and the Long Zii can come to terms.

06:59.960 --> 07:01.621
He requests a meeting at the temple.

07:01.720 --> 07:03.904
- A truce.
- Fuck that.

uppity bitch she can...

07:10.400 --> 07:12.960
Enough. When?

07:13.040 --> 07:15.600
Tomorrow. Three O'clock.

07:18.880 --> 07:20.199
We'll be there.

07:27.560 --> 07:29.539
You meet with her,
and you're basically giving her

07:29.640 --> 07:31.267
all the boss cred she needs.

07:31.360 --> 07:32.861
Open your eyes.

07:32.960 --> 07:35.906
She was boss when he was still alive.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.388
I knew Long Zii.

07:37.480 --> 07:39.061
I could anticipate him.

07:39.160 --> 07:40.980
But I don't know her.

07:41.080 --> 07:43.822
And I can't know her mind
until I meet her face-to-face.

07:43.920 --> 07:45.547

what she wants

07:45.640 --> 07:47.346
and what she'll do to get it.

07:47.440 --> 07:49.863
They moved on you
in broad fucking daylight.

07:49.960 --> 07:51.143
We can end this.

07:51.280 --> 07:53.589
By scrapping ourselves down
to our last man?

07:53.680 --> 07:55.625
We have the best fighters
in Chinatown.

07:55.720 --> 07:57.381
We don't know how deep
the Long Zii's alliance

07:57.480 --> 07:59.459
with the Fung Hai goes.

07:59.560 --> 08:03.144
For now, we have to assume
Mai Ling has two armies.

08:03.240 --> 08:04.559
If we want to hold on to Chinatown,

08:04.640 --> 08:07.700
we need to scrap smarter, not harder.

are fighting over the Opium trade.

Now a third tong's involved.

09:03.720 --> 09:05.904
You want to understand Chinatown.

09:07.800 --> 09:09.506
But you can't.

09:21.600 --> 09:23.864
- There are laws that would allow me...
-"Laws."

09:25.880 --> 09:28.064
No laws here.

09:28.160 --> 09:30.025
Only survival.

09:32.480 --> 09:35.506
Same for you, huh?

09:35.600 --> 09:38.160
You want to survive,

09:38.240 --> 09:41.186
you stop trying to understand.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.119
Now,

09:46.320 --> 09:48.140
I really must ask you to go.

09:48.240 --> 09:51.107
Police are very bad for business.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.900
I don't know why I thought
you'd help me.

09:55.920 --> 09:57.023

09:59.360 --> 10:00.907
I just did.

10:07.360 --> 10:09.920
O'HARA: You have to take me
out of Chinatown.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.457
I've done my best,
but enough is enough.

or become a pawn

10:24.320 --> 10:25.901
in some political pissing match!

10:26.800 --> 10:28.461
If there's blood
on the streets of Chinatown,

10:28.560 --> 10:30.460
it's because the man
I appointed to keep them safe

10:30.560 --> 10:32.027
has failed to perform his duty.

10:33.040 --> 10:36.100
You're not asking to be
rewarded for failure, are you?

10:36.200 --> 10:38.304
If I fail, I stay.

10:38.400 --> 10:41.380
IfI succeed, they'll probably
make me a fucking lieutenant

10:41.480 --> 10:42.902
and tell me I have to stay.

10:45.200 --> 10:46.861
We're civil servants, Bill.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.786
So we serve.

10:48.880 --> 10:50.507
Don't take such a grim view.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.387
Maybe the Exclusion Act will pass

10:54.480 --> 10:56.857
and the chinks will all
sail back to China.

10:57.920 --> 10:58.944

14:45.400 --> 14:47.140
figured out where my money
was coming from, and...

14:48.720 --> 14:50.779
Well, they accused me
Of fronting for a... (STU'I'I'ERS)

14:51.960 --> 14:52.949
A...

14:53.040 --> 14:55.622
- What?
- A Chinese whore.

14:57.760 --> 15:00.581
They threatened to kill the deal
and expose us to the bank,

15:00.680 --> 15:02.545
unless we pay them more.

15:03.880 --> 15:05.268
How much?

15:05.840 --> 15:07.159
Five thousand dollars.

15:07.880 --> 15:09.142
If they report us,

15:09.240 --> 15:11.140
the bank will seize
the entire portfolio.

15:11.240 --> 15:13.424
All Of your land, gone.

15:14.240 --> 15:15.741
I'll be ruined

15:15.840 --> 15:17.944
and possibly brought up
on criminal charges.

15:19.560 --> 15:20.777
I'm sorry, Ah Toy.

15:20.880 --> 15:23.303
I tried to negotiate with them,
but they have all the leverage.

15:23.440 --> 15:24.782
It's Okay.

15:25.840 --> 15:27.102
We fix.

15:27.800 --> 15:28.983
How?

15:29.080 --> 15:30.263
Pay them.

15:30.920 --> 15:33.229
Are you sure? What if they want more?

15:33.320 --> 15:34.742
No choice.

15:34.840 --> 15:36.865
First we buy silence.

15:36.960 --> 15:38.382
Then we make plan.

15:40.160 --> 15:41.184
One condition.

15:42.720 --> 15:46.304
Close deal on Spring Valley first.

15:46.400 --> 15:49.506
Then we pay. Only Way-

15:52.680 --> 15:55.240
As leader of the Chinatown
Busmess ASSOCIatlon,

15:55.320 --> 15:59.347
it is my duty to represent
the interests Of our community.

15:59.440 --> 16:01.624
Which is why I've called this meeting.

16:02.760 --> 16:05.399
Things have gotten out of hand.

16:05.480 --> 16:07.619
Your men are dying,

16:07.720 --> 16:09.585
but this fighting hurts everyone.

16:10.400 --> 16:11.788
People are scared.

16:12.320 --> 16:14.345
Our businesses suffer.

16:14.440 --> 16:16.783
All due respect, Lao Ting,

16:16.880 --> 16:18.745
but if she wants an end to the war,

16:18.840 --> 16:23.061
the opium treaty between the Hop Wei
and Long Zii must be upheld.

16:23.160 --> 16:25.264
What makes you think
I want an end to this war?

16:27.360 --> 16:29.100
Mai Ling.

16:29.200 --> 16:32.306
Because I'm still recovering
from your recent attempt on my life,

16:32.400 --> 16:33.981
and I don't want
to be standing here all day

16:34.080 --> 16:35.297
seeing who can piss further,

16:35.400 --> 16:38.346
I'm gonna show you the respect
you haven't even begun to earn yet

16:38.440 --> 16:40.021
by cutting through the bullshit.

16:41.160 --> 16:43.867
You don't have the resources
to WIn a war agaInst us,

16:43.960 --> 16:46.417
_ but I have no interest
In IOSIng any more men.

16:46.520 --> 16:48.943
If you want to talk about
working out a supply deal

16:49.040 --> 16:52.225
for Long Zii territory,
we can do that.

16:52.320 --> 16:55.904
But for now, I want your assurance
that you'll honor the treaty

16:56.000 --> 16:58.560
and not attempt to receive
any more opium shipments.

16:59.920 --> 17:00.909
Oh.

17:01.640 --> 17:04.302
And I'd like an apology

17:04.400 --> 17:06.618
for siccing your Mongol dogs on me.

17:07.480 --> 17:09.823
You assassinated my husband.

17:09.920 --> 17:11.308
The leader of this tong.

17:11.920 --> 17:13.239
FATHER JUN: We retaliated.

17:13.320 --> 17:15.424
We all know you've had
Long Zii's balls in a jar

17:15.520 --> 17:16.703
for some time now.

17:16.800 --> 17:19.109
LAO TING: What's done is done.

17:19.200 --> 17:21.020
A war benefits no one.

17:21.120 --> 17:22.223
You called for this meeting.

17:22.840 --> 17:24.865
I'm assuming you have a proposition.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.986
A public tong war brings
an increased police presence,

17:28.080 --> 17:30.537
and none of us want
that kind of attention.

17:30.640 --> 17:32.346
Let's contain it.

17:32.440 --> 17:33.987
Two fighters.

17:34.080 --> 17:36.264
The best from each of your tongs.

17:39.280 --> 17:40.463
A duel?

17:41.680 --> 17:45.559
If the Hop Wei win, the treaty stands
for five more years,

17:45.640 --> 17:49.019
after which we agree
to good faith negotiations.

17:49.120 --> 17:51.702
If the Long Zii win,

17:51.840 --> 17:52.943
they carve out an area

17:53.040 --> 17:55.417
in which they can
deal molasses independently.

17:55.520 --> 17:57.385
Bullshit. They crossed the line.

17:57.480 --> 17:58.822
We'll just dice the whole lot Of them.

17:58.920 --> 18:00.262
Why don't you dice me right now?

18:00.880 --> 18:04.941
Why don't you each just take a minute
to consider your Options, hmm?

18:13.800 --> 18:15.540
What do you think?

18:15.640 --> 18:17.460
It's interesting.

18:17.560 --> 18:19.380
We're ready for a war.

18:19.480 --> 18:21.220
Using Fung Hai muscle.

18:22.440 --> 18:24.385
You think the alliance is a mistake?

18:24.600 --> 18:25.589
(EXHALES)

18:25.680 --> 18:28.740
I think we have a chance to end it
before we have to find out.

18:28.840 --> 18:30.159
You can't agree to this.

18:30.240 --> 18:32.185
A fucking contest?

18:32.280 --> 18:35.022
- Buys us time.
- Time for what?

18:35.120 --> 18:36.860
We need to move while they're weak.

18:36.960 --> 18:38.860
Put an end to Long Zii
once and for all.

18:38.960 --> 18:40.985
Maybe, but at what cost?

18:41.080 --> 18:42.820
How many men?

18:42.920 --> 18:45.741
Mai Ling is inexperienced, reckless.

18:45.840 --> 18:47.262
She'll make a mistake.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.146
Show us her throat.

18:49.240 --> 18:51.800
And when she does, we'll be ready.

18:57.480 --> 19:00.904
If the Long Zii agree to the terms,

19:01.000 --> 19:02.467
so do we.

19:03.640 --> 19:04.629
Mai Ling?

19:07.320 --> 19:08.639
Then it is settled.

19:08.720 --> 19:10.460
Wang Chao, will you see
to the details?

19:11.120 --> 19:12.303
Of course.

19:21.240 --> 19:23.458
(DOOR OPENS)

19:27.760 --> 19:28.749
Hey-

19:34.720 --> 19:36.347
Where were you the other night?

19:38.120 --> 19:39.781
I'm sorry. Something came up.

19:43.520 --> 19:44.862
I waited for you.

19:47.600 --> 19:49.067
For hours.

19:50.320 --> 19:52.060
I wanted to be here.

19:53.440 --> 19:55.260
Believe me, I had no choice.

19:57.040 --> 19:59.349
I do believe you. That's the problem.

20:04.240 --> 20:05.628
I'm not following you.

20:05.720 --> 20:08.427
You didn't have a choice,
and neither dO I.

20:10.720 --> 20:11.903
- Penny...
- And then, this morning,

20:12.000 --> 20:14.104
I hear about dead hatchetmen
on the streets of Chinatown.

20:14.200 --> 20:15.269
Oh...

20:15.560 --> 20:17.141
You don't have to worry about me.

20:17.800 --> 20:18.983
I can handle myself.

20:20.720 --> 20:24.019
- You could have been killed.
- But I wasn't.

20:24.160 --> 20:25.343
But you will be.

20:26.280 --> 20:28.544
One of these days,

20:28.640 --> 20:30.267
it will be you.

20:30.520 --> 20:31.509
No.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.659
Honestly, I don't know
what we were thinking.

20:34.440 --> 20:36.465
Can you imagine if someone found out?

20:39.920 --> 20:42.024
We don't exist outside this apartment,

20:42.120 --> 20:43.257
and we never will.

20:43.360 --> 20:44.861
No, it doesn't have to be that way.

20:44.960 --> 20:46.279
Really?

20:46.360 --> 20:48.225
Tell me, what kind Of future
do we have?

20:48.320 --> 20:49.901
What is this?

20:53.640 --> 20:58.339
You're the one good thing I've found
in this whole fucking country.

21:04.120 --> 21:05.781
It's not enough.

21:07.280 --> 21:09.919
I'm the mayor's wife, for God's sake.

21:10.760 --> 21:12.580

You're...

- Yeah.

Perhaps there's a better way
for us to resolve this issue.

but surely you don't expect us
to support a candidate

30:28.160 --> 30:29.866
who's gonna decimate
our greatest source

30:29.960 --> 30:31.097
Of inexpensive labor?

30:31.200 --> 30:34.306
There are larger issues here
than your bottom line, Merriweather.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.960
The spiritual and moral core
Of the nation is at risk!

30:37.040 --> 30:38.826
I agree.

30:38.920 --> 30:41.900
And there is certainly no shortage
Of American men looking for work.

30:42.000 --> 30:45.458
If we keep hiring foreign labor,
we will decimate the working class.

30:45.560 --> 30:48.700
I'd probably feel the same way
ifI inherited my wealth.

As a fellow businessman,

30:56.440 --> 30:58.704
I am sensitive to your concerns,
Mr. Merriweather,

30:58.800 --> 31:01.257
and once we have voted in
the Exclusion Act,

31:01.360 --> 31:04.102
we can certainly legislate
for ample Chinese labor

31:04.200 --> 31:06.020
as economics dictate.

31:06.120 --> 31:07.257
Tell me, Senator.

31:08.160 --> 31:10.378
You compare the Chinese
to the Indians,

31:10.480 --> 31:11.549
and I can't help but wonder

31:11.680 --> 31:14.387
how the Indians viewed
the arrIval of our own ancestors

31:14.480 --> 31:16.505
turning up on their shores in droves.

31:16.600 --> 31:19.103
We brought with us God and civility.

31:19.200 --> 31:21.418
You mean because we murdered them
by the thousands with bullets

31:21.520 --> 31:23.499
instead Of tomahawks and spears?

31:23.600 --> 31:25.181
I imagine they would
have wanted to enact

31:25.320 --> 31:27.379
an Exclusion Act all their own
where we were concerned.

31:27.480 --> 31:29.539
Oh, Penelope, dear.

31:29.640 --> 31:31.187
I hardly think it's fair to compare.

31:31.280 --> 31:33.703
My point is, we came to a country,

31:33.800 --> 31:35.620
found a people we deemed inferior,

31:35.720 --> 31:37.506
_ and stole their land
rIght out from under them,

31:37.600 --> 31:39.704
and since then,
we have imported different races

31:39.800 --> 31:41.825
we deem inferior to dO
our dIrty work for us.

31:41.960 --> 31:43.177
And when that work is done,

31:43.280 --> 31:45.942
we lament their presence
in our country

31:46.040 --> 31:47.667
as an assault on our values.
