01:35.624 --> 01:37.917
"Title One of the Stafford Act:

01:37.921 --> 01:41.175
'Emergency' means any occasion
or instance for which,

01:41.380 --> 01:43.340
in the determination
of the president..."

01:43.424 --> 01:45.801
"Determined" by the president.

01:45.884 --> 01:47.803
- Any instance?
- As long as we can make the argument

01:47.886 --> 01:50.097
that this saves lives
and protects health and safety.

01:50.180 --> 01:52.349
Well, unemployment leads to crime,

01:52.433 --> 01:55.603
to malnutrition,
to improper medical care.

01:55.686 --> 01:58.105
There's no doubt it'll
be challenged in the courts.

01:58.189 --> 01:59.857
Well, even so, by the time that happens,

01:59.940 --> 02:02.401
people will see what
America Works looks like.

02:02.485 --> 02:05.739
Tell me, in your legal opinion...

02:07.281 --> 02:08.574
is there enough leeway here?

02:08.657 --> 02:10.576
Yes, the language is sufficiently vague.

02:10.660 --> 02:13.621
But just to be clear,
this is completely unorthodox.

02:13.704 --> 02:16.499
No president has ever tried
to reappropriate funds this way.

02:16.582 --> 02:18.709
Thank you, gentlemen, that's all I need.

02:20.336 --> 02:23.423
The states won't go for this.
Too radical.

02:23.506 --> 02:27.259
And if I call just one governor
who says no and leaks it to the press,

02:27.343 --> 02:31.180
Congress will be on my ass
before I get this out of the gates.

02:31.263 --> 02:33.307
But, the District of Columbia...

02:33.390 --> 02:37.060
- No governor.
- Just you, the mayor.

02:37.144 --> 02:39.522
Now, Barney, I know
this puts you out on a ledge.

02:39.605 --> 02:42.650
I love it.
I love everything about it.

02:43.942 --> 02:48.155
We have to fight Congress for every
dollar in our budget, each year.

02:48.238 --> 02:51.825
If my people see me take the money
they won't give us...

02:51.908 --> 02:53.410
well, I just won reelection.

02:53.494 --> 02:56.913
This is why you put a brawler
like Barney Hull in office,

02:56.997 --> 02:58.915
aside from paying a debt.

02:58.999 --> 03:02.252
Add up 50 governors
and 535 members of Congress,

03:02.336 --> 03:05.881
you don't come close
to the gumption of one bold mayor.

03:05.964 --> 03:09.176
I want people registering for jobs
in every part of the city

03:09.259 --> 03:12.179
as soon as possible, before
the court challenges bubble up.

03:12.262 --> 03:14.848
What about one big tent right
in front of the Capitol?

03:14.931 --> 03:18.851
Make Congress see the people line up all
the way back to the Lincoln Memorial.

03:18.935 --> 03:21.021
Can we do something by July Fourth?

03:21.104 --> 03:23.940
You bring the fireworks,
I'll bring the people.

03:28.028 --> 03:30.740
Good morning. Please, sit.

03:30.823 --> 03:32.991
I know Remy has just briefed you all,

03:33.075 --> 03:35.452
so, aside from the Secretary
of Homeland Security,

03:35.536 --> 03:38.706
who is no longer with us,
does anyone else object to this plan?

03:39.956 --> 03:42.585
Good. Until a new
secretary is confirmed,

03:42.668 --> 03:45.755
FEMA will report directly to me.
Thank you all very much.

03:47.000 --> 03:53.074

04:02.688 --> 04:06.108
Unemployment doesn't constitute
a natural disaster, Mr. President.

04:06.191 --> 04:09.779
The Stafford Act gives me
full authority to define an emergency.

04:09.862 --> 04:12.656
But, sir, we've only got
about three billion left

04:12.740 --> 04:15.868
in the Disaster Relief Fund, and we're
about to go into hurricane season.

04:15.951 --> 04:18.551
So we use the three billion
that's there, and if a hurricane hits,

04:18.620 --> 04:22.416
Congress replenishes the funds,
just as they always do.

04:22.499 --> 04:25.795
When it comes to a disaster,
every hour counts, sir.

04:25.878 --> 04:30.299
- If we're waiting around for Congress...
- Mr. Silva, this is moving forward.

04:31.425 --> 04:33.093
People could die, Mr. President.

04:33.176 --> 04:35.638
People are dying
because they don't have jobs.

04:35.721 --> 04:39.099
Slower than a flood or an earthquake,
but dying just the same.

04:39.182 --> 04:42.185
You can't compare unemployment
to a cat four hurricane.

04:42.269 --> 04:45.606
I came to your office because
I want this to remain your office.

04:45.689 --> 04:48.275
There's a reason three presidents
have kept you here.

04:48.358 --> 04:52.362
You're dedicated, you're relentless,
you're exceptionally competent.

04:52.446 --> 04:55.282
If we have to stretch dollars even
further, you're the man to do it.

04:55.365 --> 04:58.410
It's either you
or someone far less experienced.

05:00.788 --> 05:02.788
The two of you head to Iowa
at the end of the week.

05:02.832 --> 05:05.167
That's right.
Eighteen counties this trip.

05:05.250 --> 05:09.004
By January, I plan on hitting all 99.

05:09.087 --> 05:13.216
John will join me at every event
until his husband is released.

05:13.300 --> 05:15.460
Have you had any
contact with Michael since his arrest?

05:15.469 --> 05:19.473
The Russian government has refused.
They won't let him speak to a lawyer.

05:19.556 --> 05:21.892
That's why it's important John join me.

05:21.975 --> 05:24.269
We need to keep the pressure
up on Moscow.

05:24.353 --> 05:26.188
You know,
gay rights is controversial

05:26.271 --> 05:27.272
in many parts of the country.

05:27.356 --> 05:29.733
Do you think that appearing
with Corrigan's husband

05:29.817 --> 05:30.984
could possibly hurt you?

05:31.067 --> 05:34.154
I think the American people want
a candidate who doesn't dodge,

05:34.237 --> 05:37.115
who is truthful about where she stands.

05:37.199 --> 05:39.743
Not someone who shies away
from controversy.

05:39.827 --> 05:41.745
It's one thing to shy away
from controversy.

05:41.829 --> 05:43.413
It's another thing to court it.

05:43.497 --> 05:46.333
Well, Michael was arrested
for speaking his mind.

05:46.416 --> 05:49.586
If defending free speech is
controversial, then...

05:49.770 --> 05:51.480
we're no better than Russia.

05:51.563 --> 05:54.566
I wish that there were more people
in our government defending it.

05:54.650 --> 05:57.862
Are you talking specifically
about the Underwood Administration?

05:57.945 --> 05:59.613
I think the president
could do more.

05:59.696 --> 06:02.867
You know, the White House
has said hat they've been speaking

06:02.950 --> 06:05.494
directly with the Kremlin,
that they, and I quote here:

06:05.577 --> 06:08.246
"Have to tackle this issue
as it relates to the larger

06:08.330 --> 06:11.124
diplomatic relationship
between the two nations."

06:11.207 --> 06:15.128
Then why haven't we seen
any evidence of those talks?

06:15.211 --> 06:18.757
When I'm president,
the American people can rest assured

06:18.841 --> 06:24.513
that I will take my oath to defend
and protect our citizens seriously.

06:24.596 --> 06:28.266
- What do you think of her?
- What, Dunbar?

06:28.350 --> 06:29.685
Yeah.

06:29.768 --> 06:31.854
I believe that the
administration could do better...

06:31.937 --> 06:35.231
- You worked for Underwood.
- Not anymore.

06:36.775 --> 06:38.527
I won't be offended.

06:41.321 --> 06:44.033
Uh, I like a lot about
what she has to say.

06:47.202 --> 06:49.997
Would you vote for her?

06:50.081 --> 06:52.708
I don't know. I might.

06:52.791 --> 06:56.503
Yeah. Probably would.

06:56.586 --> 06:59.048
- How soon?
- Tomorrow.

06:59.131 --> 07:00.841
We're gonna get hit hard on this.

07:00.925 --> 07:03.969
- Better than getting hit on Corrigan.
- You saw Vieira?

07:04.053 --> 07:06.972
Dunbar's smart. She's running
against us before we're even running.

07:07.056 --> 07:09.141
She'll attack us on the FEMA thing, too.

07:09.224 --> 07:11.518
Then let her. At least
we're controlling the narrative.

07:11.601 --> 07:13.645
When we first spoke,
you mentioned early fall.

07:13.729 --> 07:16.356
Look, Dunbar's got momentum
because no one's challenging her.

07:16.439 --> 07:19.110
But once we drop the FEMA plan,
that'll take her off message.

07:19.192 --> 07:21.987
And your candidacy will distract her.
It's a one-two punch.

07:22.071 --> 07:23.752
We'll start bleeding away
the woman's vote.

07:23.822 --> 07:25.782
I'm just not sure how smart it is
to rush into a campaign

07:25.866 --> 07:28.077
- with so little preparation.
- This isn't a real campaign.

07:28.160 --> 07:30.495
But it needs to look like one.

07:30.579 --> 07:32.789
I thought you wanted to be on my ticket.

07:32.873 --> 07:35.167
It's my reputation at stake.

07:35.250 --> 07:37.836
- I don't want to look foolhardy.
- Look, no one...

07:37.920 --> 07:40.756
Mayor's announcing in the morning.
Seth's working with his office.

07:40.839 --> 07:42.549
You see, Jackie, this is perfect timing.

07:42.632 --> 07:44.676
The FEMA plan goes into action,

07:44.760 --> 07:47.512
you announce in a couple of weeks,
you say you had to run.

07:47.596 --> 07:50.057
President Underwood
is being reckless with FEMA.

07:50.141 --> 07:53.852
You come out against me and America
Works and you steal Dunbar's thunder.

07:53.936 --> 07:57.189
And then I flip-flop when I pull out
and you put me on the ticket?

07:57.272 --> 08:01.693
By then, 50,000 people will have jobs,
and it won't look like a flip-flop.

08:01.777 --> 08:03.570
It'll look like you saw the light.

08:03.653 --> 08:07.158
Now, look, why don't you go off
with Remy and you discuss the details,

08:07.240 --> 08:10.119
and just give it some thought
before you decide.

08:11.787 --> 08:14.247
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- Let's talk in my office.

08:15.624 --> 08:19.044
My biggest concern is funding.
I couldn't fly coach to Iowa.

08:19.128 --> 08:21.005
I'll get you some PAC money
rolling your way.

08:21.088 --> 08:22.965
Should be enough to get you started.

08:24.382 --> 08:27.510
If I run, it shouldn't be half-ass.

08:27.594 --> 08:30.222
Which is why we should talk about this.

08:35.727 --> 08:37.980
You want a candidate
with a family.

08:38.063 --> 08:40.356
We are after the woman's vote.

08:43.193 --> 08:45.946
Alan and I have already talked about it.

08:46.030 --> 08:47.322
You have?

08:48.448 --> 08:52.244
Yeah. We joked about getting married
on our first date.

08:52.327 --> 08:55.039
I get two kids
without the stretch marks.

08:58.917 --> 09:01.670
And when I mentioned I might run,
it stopped becoming a joke.

09:02.963 --> 09:05.381
Is Alan open to it?

09:05.465 --> 09:07.634
- It was his idea.
- And what about you?

09:09.136 --> 09:10.595
We do love each other.

09:10.679 --> 09:12.555
Hm. He seems like a good guy.

09:12.639 --> 09:15.684
He is. And his children are wonderful.

09:17.894 --> 09:19.562
You should think about getting hitched.

09:23.399 --> 09:24.901
Should we talk timeline?

09:24.985 --> 09:27.570
- For marriage?
- The campaign.

09:40.709 --> 09:43.753
This is far from an offer.
This is a conversation.

09:43.837 --> 09:46.173
And it's a conversation
that never happened.

09:46.257 --> 09:48.383
I took the back door in,
I'll take the back door out.

09:48.466 --> 09:52.096
We keep you off the payroll this quarter.
You start officially September 30th.

09:52.179 --> 09:54.848
Next quarter's FEC filings. It's fine.

09:56.141 --> 09:57.742
What are you thinking
in terms of salary?

09:57.809 --> 10:00.436
Twenty-two thousand per quarter.

10:00.520 --> 10:03.648
That's way below what I'm worth.
Even in this state.

10:03.732 --> 10:05.109
What do you think's appropriate?

10:05.192 --> 10:07.527
Two-fifty and three points
on the ad-buy.

10:07.610 --> 10:10.322
- That's beyond our means.
- No, it's not.

10:10.405 --> 10:12.157
It's a drop in the bucket
from your estate.

10:12.241 --> 10:15.827
You said you wanted in
because you believed in this campaign.

10:15.911 --> 10:18.705
- That's right.
- Sounds like it's more about money.

10:18.788 --> 10:23.252
It's about being valued.
Two-fifty and the points is a bargain.

10:23.335 --> 10:26.130
I want to work for you,
just not as a beggar.

10:26.213 --> 10:28.381
We don't trust you yet, Doug.

10:28.464 --> 10:31.843
We don't even halfway trust you,
so you are a beggar.

10:31.927 --> 10:35.597
And you shouldn't trust me...
until I prove myself.

10:35.680 --> 10:39.392
That's a gamble you don't get to take
without putting chips on the table.

10:40.852 --> 10:42.938
Cynthia and I will discuss.

10:47.483 --> 10:49.194
Thank you for your time.

10:54.741 --> 10:56.368
Let me check first.

10:58.954 --> 11:00.496
Okay, it's clear.

11:04.417 --> 11:07.171
- What do you think?
- Why take the gamble?

11:07.254 --> 11:08.880
I don't want us
to start making decisions

11:08.964 --> 11:11.258
from a position of weakness.
That is how you lose.

11:11.342 --> 11:13.509
I think we're inviting the fox
into the hen house.

11:13.593 --> 11:16.846
Anyone who wants to be a mole accepts
the first offer without question.

11:16.930 --> 11:18.473
He's negotiating.

11:18.556 --> 11:20.683
So you actually believe him?

11:21.810 --> 11:24.437
Not necessarily.

11:26.481 --> 11:29.734
But that doesn't mean
that he doesn't have value.

11:31.653 --> 11:35.448
Yeah, we're not gonna need any of these.
We're gonna keep these right here.

11:35.531 --> 11:38.493
- Kate Baldwin, the one and only.
- I thought I heard somebody in here.

11:38.576 --> 11:41.955
Welcome to the White House.
Or welcome back, I should say.

11:42.038 --> 11:44.208
It feels smaller than I remember.

11:44.291 --> 11:47.169
- Where do they have you sitting?
- Right there, second row.

11:47.252 --> 11:50.255
Oh. I would've thought
you wanted first row.

11:50.339 --> 11:52.590
I heard you spit when you talk.

11:52.674 --> 11:54.759
What's the president speaking
about tomorrow?

11:54.843 --> 11:56.761
- You don't waste a minute, do you?
- No.

11:56.845 --> 11:57.971
I gotta say, I was surprised

11:58.054 --> 12:00.307
that the Telegraph sent you
to cover the White House.

12:00.391 --> 12:03.685
- I mean, who leaves the London bureau?
- Ayla was a protégée of mine.

12:03.768 --> 12:06.438
I see, so now they
bring in the big guns.

12:06.521 --> 12:08.523
Just one gun, but big enough.

12:08.606 --> 12:10.942
- Don't get any ideas.
- About what?

12:11.026 --> 12:13.278
This is gonna stay around my neck.

12:13.362 --> 12:15.447
You can't boot two reporters in a row
from the Telegraph.

12:15.530 --> 12:18.574
- Certainly not two women.
- I have no desire to do that.

12:18.658 --> 12:20.910
It's an honor to work with you.

12:20.994 --> 12:22.495
Pulitzer, Peabody.

12:22.578 --> 12:24.339
Get yourself a Nobel,
you'll have a trifecta.

12:24.415 --> 12:25.748
Oh, you're almost charming.

12:25.832 --> 12:27.542
Kate, I'm not your enemy here.

12:27.625 --> 12:30.628
You punished Ayla for doing good work.

12:30.712 --> 12:32.588
She hit hard and you hit back.
Fair enough.

12:32.672 --> 12:34.841
Well, I'm gonna hit twice as hard
as she ever did

12:34.924 --> 12:36.885
because I can
and because someone should.

12:36.968 --> 12:41.181
I look forward to it.

12:41.265 --> 12:44.893
You're such a terrible liar.
I'll see you bright and early.

12:46.561 --> 12:49.022
You got a minute?

12:49.105 --> 12:50.441
Sure.

12:53.651 --> 12:56.321
Here's the draft
for the statement tomorrow.

12:56.405 --> 12:58.198
I want it to be perfect.

12:58.282 --> 13:00.451
Congress will fire back,
all guns blazing,

13:00.533 --> 13:03.245
and I'm sure Dunbar will make
a meal and a half out of it.

13:03.328 --> 13:07.499
But I gotta say, I feel good.
To be on the offensive.

13:07.582 --> 13:09.742
If I can't scrape the money together
behind the scenes,

13:09.792 --> 13:12.254
I'll rob the bank
in broad goddamn daylight.

13:12.337 --> 13:16.174
We'll cram America Works down
their throats and watch them choke.

13:16.258 --> 13:18.176
Enough tiptoeing.

13:19.761 --> 13:21.179
Here.

13:28.353 --> 13:30.481
Oh, these changes are good.

13:31.689 --> 13:33.816
It makes me happy to see you excited.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.818
I feel free again.

13:37.737 --> 13:40.073
- I wish I felt the same.
- The resolution?

13:40.156 --> 13:42.867
Just some last minute
hand-holding, but...

13:42.951 --> 13:44.244
I think we'll get there.

13:44.328 --> 13:46.788
I have complete confidence in you.

13:50.666 --> 13:53.169
- Do you like this room?
- It's fine.

13:54.546 --> 13:56.965
You know,
I haven't spent the night here yet.

13:58.383 --> 14:01.177
- Maybe I could...
- My plane leaves at seven.

14:01.261 --> 14:03.514
I should probably get some sleep.

14:05.723 --> 14:08.184
You watch the news tomorrow.
Should be fun.

14:08.268 --> 14:11.104
- I will.
- Good night.

15:08.495 --> 15:11.080
Seventeen years,
I served the Metro Police.

15:11.164 --> 15:13.875
I've seen robberies and murders.

15:13.958 --> 15:15.960
I've seen the blight of drugs.

15:16.044 --> 15:21.757
I've seen little kids whose only meal
each day was the one they get at school.

15:21.841 --> 15:23.843
You know what's at the root of all that?

15:23.926 --> 15:26.721
Folks don't have jobs!

15:26.804 --> 15:30.141
There are 60,000
unemployed people in Washington.

15:30.225 --> 15:32.268
It's a disaster.

15:32.352 --> 15:35.313
And it's a disgrace here
in the nation's capital.

15:35.397 --> 15:37.982
So this morning,
at the president's urging,

15:38.066 --> 15:42.862
I am declaring a state of emergency
in the District of Columbia.

15:42.945 --> 15:46.115
And I am formally requesting
three billion dollars

15:46.199 --> 15:51.871
from FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund
to put people back to work.

15:51.954 --> 15:55.041
Motherfucker.

15:55.124 --> 15:58.920
Anyone, and I mean anyone,
who registers for work

15:59.003 --> 16:03.049
in the District of Columbia
will be guaranteed a job.

16:03.132 --> 16:05.594
I'm working with my cabinet
to increase workforce

16:05.677 --> 16:08.721
devoted to infrastructure,
maintenance and repair.

16:08.804 --> 16:12.434
The Defense Department will ramp up
recruitment and civilian employment.

16:12.517 --> 16:16.480
And any private sector companies
who hire AmWorks registrants

16:16.563 --> 16:20.316
will get up to $45,000
toward the yearly salary

16:20.400 --> 16:22.486
of each job that they create.

16:22.569 --> 16:25.988
Our goal is full employment
within twelve months.

16:26.072 --> 16:28.700
Our hope is that success in Washington

16:28.783 --> 16:32.954
will convince Congress
to fund America Works nationwide.

16:33.037 --> 16:34.581
Now, I'll take a few questions.

16:34.665 --> 16:36.332
Mr. President!

16:43.674 --> 16:46.301
Madam Ambassador. A word, please.

16:46.384 --> 16:47.843
Excuse me.

16:51.598 --> 16:54.976
We are withdrawing support
of the peacekeeping resolution.

16:55.059 --> 16:57.853
- Why?
- Because Israel is.

16:57.937 --> 17:01.483
Palestine is open to the plan,
but without consensus...

17:03.025 --> 17:04.944
This came directly from Jerusalem?

17:05.027 --> 17:07.614
- Yes, the foreign minister.
- Nothing came from Eliana?

17:07.698 --> 17:09.449
No, but I came to speak to her.

17:11.867 --> 17:13.953
I'll speak to her myself.
Thank you, Hasan.

17:14.036 --> 17:16.247
Thank you, Ambassador.

17:27.090 --> 17:29.511
Moscow is threatening
to sell arms to Iran.

17:29.594 --> 17:31.722
They always make that threat.

17:31.804 --> 17:33.684
The feeling in Jerusalem
is that this resolution

17:33.724 --> 17:35.808
may push them over the edge.
It's not worth the risk.

17:35.891 --> 17:38.478
Why didn't you come to me?
The vote's in two hours.

17:38.562 --> 17:40.438
I got the call 30 minutes ago.

17:40.522 --> 17:43.282
Russia doesn't want to be humiliated
because we did this without them.

17:43.316 --> 17:44.984
You know it's a bluff on their part.

17:45.067 --> 17:48.488
The prime minister feels
that this vote is just symbolic.

17:48.572 --> 17:50.741
That the US won't
actually contribute troops.

17:50.823 --> 17:53.909
No, we will absolutely follow
through once it's passed.

17:53.993 --> 17:56.162
The prime minister has his doubts.

17:57.581 --> 17:59.791
I'm sorry, it's out of my hands.

18:00.875 --> 18:01.793
Claire?

18:03.503 --> 18:06.464
Ambassadors, I need you
to withdraw the resolution.

18:06.548 --> 18:08.090
We lost consensus.

18:08.174 --> 18:11.177
I need to postpone the vote
until we get it back.

18:13.513 --> 18:16.391
Secretary Travers is a good example.

18:16.474 --> 18:18.351
Homeland Security?

18:18.434 --> 18:21.688
- Former secretary, I should say.
- He's done?

18:21.772 --> 18:23.856
They haven't announced,
but Steve called me.

18:23.939 --> 18:27.902
Said he stood up to the president
on this FEMA nonsense.

18:27.985 --> 18:30.614
Homeland Security has jurisdiction
over FEMA now.

18:30.697 --> 18:35.243
Right. The president demanded his letter
of resignation right then and there.

18:36.869 --> 18:39.038
- This is all off the record.
- Yeah.

18:40.707 --> 18:43.292
- Paul's got a big mouth.
- So it's true?

18:43.376 --> 18:46.212
- This is off the record?
- Completely.

18:46.295 --> 18:49.016
- Let me call you on my encrypted phone.
- My number is blocked, so...

18:49.048 --> 18:51.384
This is Homeland Security.
I have your number.

18:58.433 --> 19:01.143
Incoming call.
Press the pickup bu...

19:01.227 --> 19:05.022
- Mr. Secretary.
- It's true. I resigned.

19:05.106 --> 19:06.775
Why are you still in the office?

19:06.858 --> 19:09.569
Punching the clock until
the White House wants to go public.

19:09.653 --> 19:12.196
Why wouldn't you go public yourself,
if you're so against the policy?

19:12.280 --> 19:14.156
I serve at the pleasure
of the president.

19:14.240 --> 19:18.119
I have Landry on background.
I'm writing about the resignation.

19:18.202 --> 19:21.122
And I can't stop you.
But there won't be a quote from me.

19:23.499 --> 19:25.710
Don't let the administration
off the hook.

19:25.794 --> 19:28.254
This an opportunity to speak out.

19:28.337 --> 19:30.172
You don't have the career I've had

19:30.256 --> 19:35.094
by criticizing your bosses publicly,
no matter how strongly you feel.

19:35.177 --> 19:37.263
Talk to Arnie Silva,
the FEMA Administrator.

19:37.346 --> 19:39.808
He's more disgusted
by all this than I am.

20:06.083 --> 20:09.921
People's lives are in the balance.
And he doesn't care.

20:13.549 --> 20:15.802
Our projections
for the next 12 months.

20:17.595 --> 20:21.683
We're in a La Niña phase, which means
falling temperatures in the Pacific.

20:21.766 --> 20:24.895
We expect at least two
major landfalls this season.

20:24.977 --> 20:29.440
Homes destroyed, billions in damage,
tens of thousands without power.

20:29.524 --> 20:32.026
And that's just hurricanes.
If we get a major earthquake,

20:32.109 --> 20:34.028
or flood, or forest fire...

20:35.822 --> 20:38.407
It's all in there.

20:38.491 --> 20:39.868
Has he asked you to resign?

20:39.951 --> 20:42.370
He threatened it.

20:42.453 --> 20:44.915
But I said I'd cooperate.

20:44.997 --> 20:47.124
Why?

20:47.208 --> 20:50.294
Nobody has more experience.

20:50.378 --> 20:52.547
I couldn't forgive myself if I left.

20:52.630 --> 20:54.716
But you just said, if the Relief Fund
is depleted, then...

20:54.799 --> 20:56.592
People will suffer.

20:57.969 --> 21:01.973
But on my watch, fewer will suffer.

21:02.056 --> 21:04.559
I need a quote, Mr. Silva.

21:04.642 --> 21:07.061
I can't do that.

21:07.144 --> 21:09.605
People could die,
you have a responsibility.

21:09.689 --> 21:13.275
The president has built
a culture of silence and fear.

21:13.359 --> 21:14.694
That can end with you.

21:16.571 --> 21:20.575
That folder will speak louder
than anything I could say.

21:25.079 --> 21:28.959
Two front page bylines
on the same day for Ms. Baldwin?

21:29.041 --> 21:31.711
You kicked out a pit bull
and you let in a dragon.

21:31.795 --> 21:34.035
I didn't think the Telegraph
would send someone like her.

21:34.088 --> 21:35.757
Well, maybe you just didn't think.

21:35.840 --> 21:38.009
You wanted me
to implement discipline, sir.

21:38.092 --> 21:39.761
To send a message. And so I did.

21:39.844 --> 21:42.764
Well, they've sent back an even
stronger message, haven't they?

21:42.847 --> 21:44.599
I take responsibility for that, sir,

21:44.682 --> 21:46.392
and I will do my best
to keep her in line.

21:46.475 --> 21:48.394
Your best?

21:48.477 --> 21:50.814
It's their top bureau chief.
She's untouchable.

21:50.897 --> 21:53.817
I don't want to pretend that I can
control her 100 percent.

21:53.900 --> 21:55.986
- Travers?
- Denied speaking with her,

21:56.068 --> 21:59.196
but it must be him. I don't think
anybody else in the cabinet would.

21:59.280 --> 22:00.907
Let's confirm his resignation.

22:00.991 --> 22:04.368
No point in keeping it a secret now.
Tell Steve he can vacate his office.

22:04.452 --> 22:05.703
And what about Silva?

22:05.787 --> 22:08.999
The details on the disaster projections
are very inside baseball.

22:09.081 --> 22:11.375
We can't fire him!
If there's a hurricane,

22:11.459 --> 22:14.670
he's the only guy that can keep
a disaster from becoming a catastrophe.

22:14.754 --> 22:17.339
- And what's Dunbar saying?
- Nothing yet, publicly.

22:17.423 --> 22:21.761
- She's probably letting this play out.
- Letting me dig my own grave.

22:23.178 --> 22:25.849
We have to sell America Works.

22:25.932 --> 22:28.225
It should sell itself
once we get people employed.

22:28.309 --> 22:30.519
Well, that's the idea,
but we don't stop there.

22:30.603 --> 22:33.982
- Commercials and billboards?
- On whose money?

22:34.065 --> 22:36.108
And even so, we need more than ad-buys.

22:36.191 --> 22:40.279
We need...
We need the philosophy behind it.

22:40.362 --> 22:43.992
We need something of substance.
We need something...

22:54.794 --> 22:58.923
We need something
that will capture the imagination.

23:00.257 --> 23:02.426
- Either of you play Monument Valley?
- What's that?

23:02.510 --> 23:04.310
- It's a video game.
- I don't play them, sir.

23:04.345 --> 23:06.105
I sold my Xbox on eBay.
It was too addictive.

23:06.180 --> 23:08.516
No, it's not a console game.

23:08.599 --> 23:11.811
You both read this and then tell me
that you wouldn't want to play this.

23:15.940 --> 23:19.234
I'd say there's nine consultants in the
country who truly know foreign policy.

23:19.318 --> 23:20.904
Me, I'm number one.

23:20.987 --> 23:23.031
Me in a coma is number two.

23:23.114 --> 23:25.157
But that still leaves seven
who are cheaper.

23:25.240 --> 23:28.912
I value good counsel, and I'm smart
enough to know what I don't know.

23:28.995 --> 23:31.081
What would be your assessment
of us so far?

23:31.163 --> 23:33.374
You're making a big stink
out of this Michael Corrigan thing,

23:33.457 --> 23:34.750
but that's just surface.

23:34.834 --> 23:37.294
You have to understand
why Corrigan got arrested.

23:37.378 --> 23:39.463
Petrov's appealing
to his traditional base.

23:39.547 --> 23:42.508
No. This is about the Jordan Valley.

23:42.591 --> 23:44.760
I don't follow.

23:44.844 --> 23:45.887
Retaliation.

23:45.970 --> 23:48.222
It goes back to the summit
a couple of months ago.

23:48.305 --> 23:52.727
Look, this... is the Jordan Valley.

23:55.229 --> 23:56.898
All right, hold on, I'll make it easier.

24:03.278 --> 24:05.197
That's the Valley. Right there.

24:05.280 --> 24:08.076
Occupied by Israel since 1967,
it's been a major roadblock

24:08.159 --> 24:10.369
in any peace accord
with the Palestinians.

24:10.452 --> 24:13.330
Underwood sends peacekeeping troops,
the Israelis leave,

24:13.414 --> 24:16.126
- the Palestinians are happy.
- It's not that simple.

24:16.208 --> 24:19.211
Everyone gets hung up on this
little patch of land ten miles by 40,

24:19.294 --> 24:22.798
but you have to look outwards,
past Jordan and Syria, past Iraq.

24:22.882 --> 24:28.179
Here... to the Caucasus.
That's Russia's sphere of influence.

24:28.262 --> 24:31.099
They don't see the peacekeeping force
as a Middle East issue.

24:31.182 --> 24:33.225
They see it as strategic
deployment of US troops

24:33.308 --> 24:35.429
less than a thousand miles
from their southern border.

24:35.477 --> 24:38.148
So you're saying Corrigan's a pawn,
a play for leverage?

24:38.230 --> 24:39.857
More of a first salvo.

24:39.941 --> 24:42.401
Moscow wants to show it's serious
about fighting this resolution.

24:42.484 --> 24:44.319
Now, if I had to guess,

24:44.403 --> 24:47.281
Underwood tried to bring Russia
into the mix during the summit.

24:47.364 --> 24:50.868
Get involved early on as partners.
And when Petrov didn't play ball,

24:50.952 --> 24:54.580
Underwood went on the offensive,
which is a huge gamble.

24:54.663 --> 24:57.541
- Tell me how.
- Nobody wants UN troops there.

24:57.625 --> 25:00.294
Not the Israelis,
not the Palestinians, not the Arabs.

25:00.377 --> 25:02.880
They're playing along
because the US is pressuring them.

25:02.964 --> 25:04.840
But just one little thing
needs to go wrong,

25:04.924 --> 25:07.969
and you've got a tinderbox
where everyone's holding matches.

25:08.052 --> 25:11.346
So why is he following
this course of action at all?

25:11.973 --> 25:13.474
Because he's smart.

25:13.557 --> 25:15.559
- You just said...
- He's being too smart.

25:15.643 --> 25:19.105
If it pays off, hey,
he wins a Nobel Prize. But...

25:20.982 --> 25:24.902
if it backfires,
he leaves himself wide open.

25:24.986 --> 25:26.737
And that's when you need
to hit him hard.

25:26.821 --> 25:29.949
A disastrous foreign policy
that made the world more dangerous.

25:30.033 --> 25:32.618
And he had his wife
with zero foreign policy experience

25:32.701 --> 25:35.746
- lead the goddamn charge.
- I'd like to bring you aboard, Joe.

25:35.830 --> 25:38.249
- When can you start?
- I believe I already did.

25:38.332 --> 25:40.417
I'll get the paperwork
over to you later today.

25:40.501 --> 25:42.253
Let me ask, who referred me?

25:42.336 --> 25:45.215
- You have quite a reputation.
- Yeah, for being an asshole.

25:45.297 --> 25:47.508
Somebody you respect
must have recommended me highly.

25:47.591 --> 25:50.886
- A former Underwood staffer.
- I never worked with any of his people.

25:50.970 --> 25:53.264
Which is one of the reasons
he recommended you.

25:53.347 --> 25:54.640
Touché.

25:58.186 --> 25:59.854
What is this?

25:59.937 --> 26:02.232
A list of the Russian officials
who will be sanctioned

26:02.314 --> 26:04.525
if you sell a single truckload
of arms to Iran.

26:04.608 --> 26:06.819
I didn't even make the top ten.

26:06.902 --> 26:09.780
These sanctions can and will escalate.

26:09.864 --> 26:11.699
And then what?

26:11.782 --> 26:14.285
We'd build a coalition
to impose their own sanctions.

26:14.368 --> 26:15.744
And then what?

26:15.828 --> 26:20.708
Alexi, you know what an economic
crisis that would be for Russia.

26:20.791 --> 26:23.002
Like the trade war you waged with China?

26:23.086 --> 26:26.964
Except in our case, only three percent
of exports go to the US.

26:27.048 --> 26:28.924
And Europe needs our natural gas.

26:29.008 --> 26:32.136
They won't forfeit that over
a few short-range missiles to Iran.

26:32.220 --> 26:35.681
You don't want to challenge us
on the armament of a terrorist state.

26:35.764 --> 26:38.017
We'll never be presented
with that problem.

26:38.101 --> 26:40.228
You can't assure the Israelis
you'll provide troops.

26:40.311 --> 26:43.480
The president doesn't have
the support of either party in Congress.

26:43.564 --> 26:46.483
No troops, no Israel.
No Israel, no consensus.

26:46.567 --> 26:49.153
No consensus, no resolution.

26:51.072 --> 26:53.574
I will get this resolution passed.

26:53.657 --> 26:57.245
Don't underestimate my ability
or desire to do so.

26:57.328 --> 26:59.914
I've indulged your
enthusiasm long enough.

26:59.997 --> 27:01.798
You've bit off more
than you can chew, Claire.

27:01.832 --> 27:03.167
Leave this to the professionals

27:03.251 --> 27:06.087
and let your little resolution
die a painless death.

27:06.170 --> 27:09.215
The truth is, you have
no business being ambassador

27:09.299 --> 27:11.425
any more than I do being First Lady.

27:20.268 --> 27:22.019
That's a very nice dress, by the way.

27:25.480 --> 27:27.942
"She stabbed the floor with a broom.

27:28.025 --> 27:30.778
Karaoke every Wednesday.

27:30.861 --> 27:35.325
Some tone-deaf drunk girl
mutilating Britney Spears.

27:35.407 --> 27:38.244
She knew they couldn't hear
the broom in the bar below.

27:38.328 --> 27:42.414
But we all need a ritual,
and this was hers.

27:42.497 --> 27:44.583
Three short thrusts, wood on wood,

27:44.666 --> 27:48.296
a hollow sound
which accomplished nothing.

27:48.379 --> 27:50.173
David would be home soon.

27:50.256 --> 27:53.592
'It's too hot, ' he'd say.
She opened the window.

27:53.675 --> 27:57.888
The music was so loud,
she couldn't ignore it."

28:09.192 --> 28:10.692
Here.

28:13.695 --> 28:15.072
Aren't you gonna buy the new one?

28:15.156 --> 28:17.658
I will, on my Kindle.
But will you please sign this?

28:19.118 --> 28:22.413
- Who should I make it out to?
- Lesley. L-E-S-L-E-Y.

28:23.247 --> 28:25.582
Scorpio totally changed my life.

28:25.666 --> 28:29.295
The energy and the anger...
It's my favorite book of yours.

28:29.379 --> 28:31.422
Probably my favorite book, period.

28:33.132 --> 28:35.634
- Make sure you read the new one.
- Yes.

28:39.554 --> 28:40.931
Who should I make it out to?

28:48.730 --> 28:51.359
It's a perversion of the Stafford Act
and you know it.

28:51.442 --> 28:54.569
It's a reading of the Stafford Act.
We read it differently.

28:54.653 --> 28:58.490
You can't just raid funds that Congress
appropriated for a specific use,

28:58.573 --> 29:00.909
- then use them however you want.
- Clearly, I can.

29:00.993 --> 29:03.329
This is a direct challenge
to Congress, Mr. President.

29:03.413 --> 29:05.956
Bob and I have agreed.
Both parties will fight you on this.

29:06.040 --> 29:08.959
Well, at least I'm
cultivating bipartisanship.

29:09.043 --> 29:12.921
Gentlemen, I don't want to do this,
but what choice have you left me?

29:13.005 --> 29:14.840
Our branch is here to check yours.

29:14.923 --> 29:17.260
If we didn't feel America Works
warranted taxpayer money,

29:17.343 --> 29:19.761
- then it's not fit to be law.
- Now, look.

29:19.845 --> 29:22.265
This is the first time
that the leaders of both parties

29:22.348 --> 29:23.807
have met with me in one room,

29:23.891 --> 29:26.394
and not because I didn't invite you,
because you declined.

29:26.477 --> 29:29.439
So, now that we're here,
let's make the most of it.

29:29.521 --> 29:31.023
I'm willing to walk back on FEMA

29:31.106 --> 29:33.317
if we can discuss
putting AmWorks on the floor.

29:33.401 --> 29:35.944
- You bullied us on the Education Bill.
- And the government freeze.

29:36.028 --> 29:37.488
It's not gonna work this time.

29:37.571 --> 29:39.907
You watch it work
and then tell me it didn't.

29:39.990 --> 29:42.951
We're drafting a law,
saying this use of the DRF is illegal.

29:43.035 --> 29:44.786
And who's going to enforce that law?

29:44.870 --> 29:47.164
We were ready to impeach one president.

29:47.248 --> 29:49.666
We'll do the same with you if necessary.

29:49.750 --> 29:53.962
And put Donald Blythe in this office?
You know he's not up for the job.

29:54.046 --> 29:56.173
Congress would get killed
for malpractice.

29:56.257 --> 29:58.509
As crooked as you may think I am,

29:58.592 --> 30:01.387
you know I can handle the pressure,
and you know Donald can't.

30:01.471 --> 30:04.723
So pass your law, I'll veto it.
And when you overrule me in the Senate,

30:04.806 --> 30:06.808
we'll let the third branch decide.

30:06.892 --> 30:09.437
Don't declare war on Congress,
Mr. President.

30:09.520 --> 30:12.482
Not on Congress.
I'm declaring war on atrophy.

30:12.564 --> 30:15.276
But these days,
who could tell the difference?

30:36.380 --> 30:39.091
Oh! Oh...

30:57.401 --> 30:59.403
Oh...

31:14.626 --> 31:16.546
- So how about this?
- Hm?

31:18.880 --> 31:20.966
I'll order a pizza.

31:21.049 --> 31:23.635
When it gets here,
I bring it into this room...

31:25.053 --> 31:27.431
with a paper towel
draped over my arm.

31:27.515 --> 31:31.143
Voilà. Just like... room service.

31:31.226 --> 31:33.521
You don't let your kids eat pizza.

31:33.604 --> 31:36.524
Well, because I've seen
what it does to a carotid artery.

31:37.441 --> 31:40.152
- And you're not my kids.
- Mm...

31:43.364 --> 31:45.199
Do you think they like me?

31:46.700 --> 31:50.245
They adore you.

31:51.414 --> 31:54.082
Matt asked if you could teach him
how to drive.

31:54.166 --> 31:55.376
- Really?
- Yeah.

31:55.459 --> 31:57.169
He says you'd be less judgmental.

32:03.384 --> 32:05.428
Do you want to get married?

32:09.557 --> 32:11.434
To you, or in general?

32:14.478 --> 32:16.480
I'm serious.

32:19.983 --> 32:22.612
So where'd this come from?

32:22.694 --> 32:25.072
- We've talked about it.
- Hm...

32:25.155 --> 32:27.617
We say "I love you."

32:28.867 --> 32:31.786
I want a husband.
You want a wife.

32:33.581 --> 32:36.708
This works, the two of us,
don't you think?

32:38.586 --> 32:41.963
- It's very romantic.
- Aren't we past romance?

32:42.047 --> 32:43.840
I bought you a ring.

32:46.510 --> 32:48.638
Why didn't you say anything?

32:48.720 --> 32:51.432
It's the element of surprise.

32:51.515 --> 32:53.601
That's kind of the point, isn't it?

32:54.602 --> 32:57.354
It's in my glove compartment.
I can go get it if you want.

32:59.147 --> 33:01.816
No, I want you to order the pizza.

33:03.985 --> 33:06.238
We can do the whole ring thing tomorrow.

33:23.631 --> 33:25.716
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:25.799 --> 33:27.884
When did you get in?

33:27.968 --> 33:30.638
- Couple of hours ago.
- Well, come and sit down.

33:30.721 --> 33:34.057
I feel like I haven't seen you for what,
has it been three days?

33:34.141 --> 33:35.726
Four, I think.

33:35.809 --> 33:38.437
It's just all been a big blur.

33:38.521 --> 33:39.813
Mm. Same in New York.

33:39.896 --> 33:43.984
- Any luck?
- They're like a broken record, Francis.

33:44.067 --> 33:46.403
Do I need to call the prime minister?

33:46.487 --> 33:49.072
Oh, I think it's gonna take more
than a phone call.

33:49.156 --> 33:52.409
- Tell me.
- That's not why I'm here, actually.

33:55.412 --> 33:57.038
Hang on, hang on.

33:58.165 --> 34:01.585
So much has been going on in the past
few months, we hardly have time to talk.

34:01.669 --> 34:03.504
Here, use this.

34:05.715 --> 34:09.259
I feel bad about the other night
when you wanted to sleep in my bed.

34:09.342 --> 34:11.469
Oh, that. You shouldn't.

34:11.554 --> 34:13.472
I just...

34:13.556 --> 34:15.389
I don't know why
I started sleeping in there.

34:15.474 --> 34:18.851
Well, if I remember correctly,
you had a cold.

34:18.935 --> 34:21.355
But why I stayed.

34:21.438 --> 34:23.398
You don't have to explain.

34:26.025 --> 34:28.666
I want you to know that I love you.
It has nothing to do with that.

34:28.737 --> 34:30.905
I love you... as much as ever.

34:34.159 --> 34:36.161
Not another word.

34:40.290 --> 34:42.710
Let's finish talking about Israel
in the morning.

34:44.795 --> 34:47.005
You said more than a phone call?

34:49.466 --> 34:52.969
They need it in stone, Francis,
that we'll contribute troops.

34:53.053 --> 34:55.806
- An executive order.
- Congress won't be happy.

34:55.889 --> 34:57.641
Well, they're already not happy.

34:57.725 --> 35:00.519
I spat in one eye,
I might as well spit in the other.

35:00.603 --> 35:01.936
Consider it done.

35:09.820 --> 35:12.072
Thank you.
Thank you for your support.

35:12.155 --> 35:14.533
Thank you so much. Thank you.

35:14.617 --> 35:16.368
Thank you. Oh, sure.

35:21.415 --> 35:24.334
Did you get it?

35:24.418 --> 35:26.378
Thank you. Thank you so much.

35:26.461 --> 35:28.963
Thank you.
Thank you for your support.

35:29.047 --> 35:31.925
- Thank you, sir.
- I liked your speech, Ms. Dunbar.

35:32.008 --> 35:34.804
- And I've heard more than a few.
- I appreciate you saying that, sir.

35:34.886 --> 35:36.513
I know Iowans aren't easily impressed.

35:36.597 --> 35:38.515
What you said about integrity?

35:38.599 --> 35:41.393
Well, if you can bring that
to Washington, I'll caucus for you.

35:41.476 --> 35:43.729
One supporter at a time.
That's how we'll win this.

35:43.813 --> 35:47.775
And that young man? I feel for him.
He's an inspiring individual.

35:47.858 --> 35:49.693
John, there's someone
I want you to meet.

35:49.777 --> 35:51.278
- Your name, sir?
- Clive Reynolds.

35:51.361 --> 35:54.657
- Mr. Reynolds, nice to meet you.
- I'm praying for your husband.

35:54.740 --> 35:57.743
- It's awful he's still stuck there.
- Stamper's in the cafeteria.

35:57.827 --> 35:59.953
Thank you, Mr. Reynolds.
Thank you.

36:00.036 --> 36:02.581
Thank you for your support.
Thank you for coming out.

36:14.468 --> 36:16.219
You could've just called.

36:16.303 --> 36:19.306
I hate July Fourth in DC.

36:19.389 --> 36:21.141
Plus, I wanted to see you in action.

36:21.224 --> 36:23.017
What'd you think?

36:23.101 --> 36:25.145
I need her to leave.

36:30.734 --> 36:32.736
I'll meet you at the car.

36:34.404 --> 36:35.989
- Heather...
- Cynthia.

36:57.761 --> 36:59.513
Read that.

37:10.023 --> 37:13.360
Mrs. Underwood asked me to destroy it.

37:13.443 --> 37:15.153
- I didn't.
- You should have.

37:15.236 --> 37:17.197
She lied on national television.

37:17.280 --> 37:19.574
I am not running that sort of campaign.

37:22.369 --> 37:24.078
But it's good to know it's available.

37:24.162 --> 37:28.918
I would never do that to another woman,
and neither would Cynthia.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.420
Hm. Cynthia was a good choice
for your manager.

37:32.504 --> 37:35.173
She'll run a top-notch operation.

37:35.256 --> 37:37.257
But you need someone
who's willing to do the things

37:37.258 --> 37:39.052
that people like her won't do.

37:39.135 --> 37:41.764
When you asked me for a job,

37:41.847 --> 37:44.892
you said you wanted
to turn over a new leaf.

37:44.975 --> 37:48.186
I have a certain skill set,
Ms. Dunbar.

37:48.269 --> 37:52.482
For me, turning over a new leaf
is using my skills for the right reasons.

37:52.566 --> 37:54.442
Like putting you in office.

37:54.526 --> 37:58.029
One-fifty.
One point on the ad-buy.

37:59.698 --> 38:02.033
No points.

38:02.116 --> 38:06.329
But I'll do a hundred thousand win bonus
if we get the nomination.

38:20.468 --> 38:22.512
I hope I came over here
for some good news.

38:25.766 --> 38:27.726
I'm in. You can tell the president.

38:27.810 --> 38:29.603
August 19th.

38:29.686 --> 38:31.647
We wanted you to announce
a lot earlier than that.

38:31.688 --> 38:35.066
No, not the announcement. This.

38:39.070 --> 38:40.655
Cardiology's good money.

38:40.739 --> 38:44.034
Aren't you gonna say congrats?

38:44.117 --> 38:46.620
I've never seen you be this girly.

38:46.703 --> 38:49.456
It's a fucking diamond.
I'm allowed to be a little girly.

38:49.539 --> 38:52.292
Congratulations.
I'm happy for you both.

38:52.375 --> 38:53.836
Are you?

38:57.672 --> 39:00.550
Sorry. That wasn't fair.

39:00.634 --> 39:03.762
Maybe we should talk about dates
for announcing the campaign.

39:03.846 --> 39:06.849
Yeah, I have a few ideas.
Let me pull up my calendar.

39:09.059 --> 39:10.685
Um...

39:11.812 --> 39:14.648
Week after next seems
to be the best option.

39:14.731 --> 39:15.983
You have plans tonight?

39:17.525 --> 39:19.028
For the fireworks?

39:20.236 --> 39:22.572
Alan and I are taking his kids.

39:23.740 --> 39:25.617
Right. Makes sense.

39:29.329 --> 39:33.207
You were saying,
about a week after next?

39:50.017 --> 39:53.186
- The Ambassador's inside.
- You want me to go in there?

39:53.269 --> 39:56.815
She's just putting on makeup.

39:56.899 --> 39:58.733
I can wait until she comes out.

39:58.817 --> 40:01.736
She's going straight to her plane.
If you don't mind.

40:07.951 --> 40:09.285
Alexi.

40:16.751 --> 40:19.838
The day got away from me,
so I have to head down to DC

40:19.922 --> 40:22.173
for the July Fourth celebration.

40:22.256 --> 40:25.010
You may consider me
an ambassador from the men's room.

40:26.344 --> 40:28.805
Don't make me laugh.
I'll have to start over.

40:31.432 --> 40:34.811
- Good?
- Quite.

40:34.895 --> 40:37.647
Alexi, I think we've gotten off
on the wrong foot.

40:37.731 --> 40:40.233
We need to find a better way
to work together.

40:40.316 --> 40:42.694
You're letting go of the resolution?

40:44.571 --> 40:47.032
- Eyes?
- Perfect.

40:47.116 --> 40:49.325
It's always nice
to have a man's opinion.

40:50.077 --> 40:51.870
You were right, by the way.

40:51.954 --> 40:54.372
Israel won't back us
unless we commit troops.

40:54.455 --> 40:57.876
You called my bluff, Alexi,
and I shouldn't have insulted you

40:57.960 --> 41:00.545
- with one in the first place.
- I'll be outside when you finish.

41:00.628 --> 41:03.297
The president signed
an Executive Order this morning.

41:04.674 --> 41:07.802
Five thousand US military reassigned

41:07.886 --> 41:10.805
to permanent standby
for UN Peacekeeping operations.

41:10.889 --> 41:12.807
Jerusalem has been informed.

41:12.891 --> 41:15.018
Your husband doesn't have
that kind of authority.

41:15.102 --> 41:17.854
It's occupied territory.
He's not deploying on sovereign land.

41:17.938 --> 41:23.193
So, as Commander in Chief,
he doesn't need Congressional approval.

41:23.276 --> 41:27.614
Israel's back on board again, Alexi,
so the moment you sell arms to Iran,

41:27.697 --> 41:30.784
we will shoot the planes out of the sky,
the trucks off the road,

41:30.867 --> 41:32.702
and the ships out of the water.

41:32.786 --> 41:38.041
Now... maybe you'd be able
to afford sanctions...

41:39.209 --> 41:42.253
...but you sure as hell
can't afford a war.

41:42.336 --> 41:45.381
Come back to the table.
Engage us in good faith.

41:45.465 --> 41:47.176
Or the resolution goes
to a vote next week.

41:47.258 --> 41:49.886
I have always been willing to talk.

41:51.013 --> 41:53.932
Not you and I.
President to president.

41:54.016 --> 41:56.893
Oh, and we need Michael Corrigan
released, also.

42:00.605 --> 42:02.732
I'll communicate your message to Moscow.

42:02.816 --> 42:05.152
Please.
Hand me a towel, would you?

42:11.783 --> 42:13.451
What a gentleman.

42:24.838 --> 42:27.049
You ever been to the White House before?

42:27.132 --> 42:29.300
When I won the National Book Award.

42:29.383 --> 42:32.054
- Nancy was a fan.
- I'm surprised.

42:32.137 --> 42:35.140
That story doesn't exactly
revere family values.

42:35.224 --> 42:36.766
She's got the astrologer in her.

42:36.850 --> 42:39.019
I think she liked the title
more than anything.

42:39.102 --> 42:41.146
Scorpio was a very good book.

42:41.230 --> 42:44.440
- Still pays the rent.
- Have a seat.

42:44.524 --> 42:46.693
Why am I here, Mr. President?

42:46.776 --> 42:49.071
Remy briefed you.

42:49.154 --> 42:51.990
He said you needed a book.
He didn't say about what.

42:52.074 --> 42:55.702
America Works.
Not just the policy, but the origins.

42:55.785 --> 42:58.496
How a boy grew up
in a dirt-poor shithole

42:58.579 --> 43:00.790
and climbed his way out
through hard work.

43:00.874 --> 43:04.544
A story of dignity.
The pride that comes with one's labor.

43:04.627 --> 43:07.672
- Propaganda.
- You could call it that.

43:07.755 --> 43:11.009
This sort of thing...
it's not in my wheelhouse.

43:11.093 --> 43:13.761
You need a salesman, not a novelist.

43:15.138 --> 43:19.184
"Whoever you are,
whoever you think you are,

43:19.268 --> 43:23.521
believe that you're
also a silent princess.

43:23.604 --> 43:26.149
Your name is Ida.

43:26.233 --> 43:29.527
Your journey is one
through a forgotten landscape

43:29.610 --> 43:32.906
of twisting staircases
and morphing castles,

43:32.989 --> 43:37.451
atop floating stones
defiantly crossing an angry sea,

43:37.535 --> 43:41.789
within dimly-lit caverns
cobwebbed with ruins

43:41.873 --> 43:45.919
M.C. Escher could
only grasp at in a dream state."

43:46.002 --> 43:48.379
You read my video game reviews?

43:48.462 --> 43:51.841
I tend to play shoot-'em-ups.
The indie games don't really interest me.

43:51.925 --> 43:56.512
I need adrenaline and action.
But when I read this, I had to try it.

43:56.596 --> 44:00.558
If you can convince me to be a silent
princess with just a hundred words,

44:00.641 --> 44:03.561
imagine how many millions
you can convince with this book.

44:03.644 --> 44:05.855
You are a salesman, Thomas.

44:05.939 --> 44:09.359
I wasn't trying to sell anything.
Just describe my experience.

44:09.442 --> 44:11.442
That's exactly what I want you to do
with my story.

44:11.485 --> 44:14.572
No sales pitch,
just your honest curiosity.

44:14.655 --> 44:18.285
Besides, these kinds of books
are always so boring, so safe.

44:18.368 --> 44:22.289
I want something different,
something... unique.

44:22.372 --> 44:24.498
Your voice.

44:24.582 --> 44:27.127
I don't even know if I believe
in your program.

44:28.295 --> 44:30.213
Come with me.
I want to show you something.

45:13.547 --> 45:16.050
You build it and they come.

45:16.134 --> 45:20.054
Today, the Washington Mall
is the real Field of Dreams.

45:20.138 --> 45:23.724
Three thousand people have registered
since we set up shop this morning.

45:23.808 --> 45:26.311
Now that's what I call
a Fourth of July party!

45:26.395 --> 45:29.897
And we're gonna keep the party going
'round the clock, 24/7,

45:29.981 --> 45:33.443
till everyone in DC who wants a job

45:33.526 --> 45:36.612
can make their way
down here and sign up.

45:43.370 --> 45:44.829
Have a look.

45:47.290 --> 45:51.461
- Do you see that line of people?
- The AmWorks tent.

45:51.544 --> 45:54.256
It stretches from there all the way
to the Lincoln Memorial.

45:54.339 --> 45:56.757
They started lining up before sunrise.

45:58.009 --> 45:59.593
It's really something.

45:59.677 --> 46:02.222
Thomas, at best,
I'm going to be a footnote in history

46:02.305 --> 46:04.765
if I can't help those people.
At worst, I'll be a joke.

46:04.849 --> 46:06.476
I am those people.

46:06.559 --> 46:09.229
I want you to tell that story.

46:09.312 --> 46:11.356
What do you say?

46:11.440 --> 46:14.484
- I don't know.
- What's your gut say?

46:14.567 --> 46:18.571
That you don't add up,
and I'm intrigued.

46:18.654 --> 46:20.740
- But not sold.
- Not yet.

46:20.823 --> 46:22.825
Well, I'll pay you well,
and at the very least,

46:22.909 --> 46:25.245
this sort of access
is worth its weight in gold, isn't it?

46:25.328 --> 46:26.455
Sir, the First Lady's back.

46:26.537 --> 46:29.123
I have to go give my Fourth of July
speech before the fireworks.

46:29.207 --> 46:31.376
- How quickly would you need the book?
- By January.

46:31.460 --> 46:33.794
I've never written anything
in less than a year.

46:33.878 --> 46:37.048
Well, you don't strike me as someone
who shies away from a challenge.

46:38.716 --> 46:40.760
I'd need to be able to write it
the way I want to write it.

46:40.843 --> 46:43.930
Absolutely. Look, take your time.
Enjoy the view.

46:44.013 --> 46:45.848
Meechum will show you out
when you're done.

46:45.932 --> 46:49.643
And I promise, if you say yes,
you won't regret it.

46:52.021 --> 46:55.317
No writer worth his salt
can resist a good story,

46:55.400 --> 46:59.488
just as no politician can resist
making promises he can't keep.

47:07.578 --> 47:10.998
Viktor, we'd be honored
to accept the invitation.

47:11.082 --> 47:14.043
Yes, I agree,
there's much to discuss.

47:14.127 --> 47:16.879
I'll have my office reach out
to the Kremlin.

47:16.963 --> 47:18.965
We'll find dates
that work for both of us.

47:20.674 --> 47:22.385
Thank you.

47:22.469 --> 47:25.179
Well, you should get some sleep.
It's late over there.

47:26.389 --> 47:28.015
Good night.

47:29.100 --> 47:30.810
Hold off on the vote?

47:30.893 --> 47:34.272
Until we sit down.
But we keep it in our back pocket.

47:34.356 --> 47:35.898
Michael Corrigan?

47:35.982 --> 47:38.692
They're going to release him
when we visit.

47:38.776 --> 47:41.070
You made a miracle happen.

47:41.154 --> 47:42.655
We did.

47:51.414 --> 47:54.417
...each unique citizen
contributes to our future.

47:54.501 --> 47:56.043
Can you turn that up?

47:56.127 --> 47:58.671
Our forefathers,
when they declared independence,

47:58.754 --> 48:01.757
understood the power
of the individual,

48:01.841 --> 48:04.635
the value of self-determination.

48:04.718 --> 48:06.846
They freed us from tyranny.

48:06.929 --> 48:08.557
- They proved...
- He is a tyrant.

48:08.639 --> 48:10.519
I don't know,
there's a lot of people out there.

48:10.559 --> 48:11.851
He might be onto something.

48:11.934 --> 48:14.145
Executive Order for UN troops?
He's out of control.

48:14.228 --> 48:16.689
At least he's doing something.
Walker didn't do shit.

48:16.772 --> 48:19.442
I think we replaced a dud
with an atom bomb.

48:19.526 --> 48:22.529
They had to fight
to secure their freedom.

48:22.612 --> 48:25.656
And now we have to fight to maintain it.

48:25.739 --> 48:27.950
The freedom to work.

48:28.034 --> 48:30.703
The freedom to live with dignity.

48:30.786 --> 48:33.164
The freedom to hope.

48:33.247 --> 48:37.668
Thank you, and God bless
the United States of America.
