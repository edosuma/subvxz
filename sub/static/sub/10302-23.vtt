02:11.360 --> 02:13.032
- Great sandwich, Mom.
- Oh, yeah.

02:13.280 --> 02:15.430
We should all be grateful
to late Aunt Stumpy...

02:15.640 --> 02:18.313
...for leaving us her refrigerator
full of food.

02:19.520 --> 02:21.750
Well, she didn't exactly
leave it to us. I mean...

02:21.960 --> 02:25.350
...we took it off the back porch
while everyone else was at the funeral.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.752
Shouldn't we tell Dad
about the fridge?

02:29.000 --> 02:30.991
Oh, no. I'm sure he made out fine.

02:31.240 --> 02:34.789
It was an open casket.
He probably got the watch.

02:36.440 --> 02:40.592
Well, refrigerator's hidden in the
garage. Dad will never know it's there.

02:40.840 --> 02:44.435
It's concealed so well, even
a clever man wouldn't be able to find it.

02:53.920 --> 02:56.992
I hate those complaint boxes
they put in at the mall.

02:57.240 --> 02:58.639
A woman comes in the store...

02:58.880 --> 03:01.952
...so huge she's protected
by Greenpeace...

03:02.520 --> 03:05.114
...and asked for a size-four shoe.

03:09.160 --> 03:13.438
So I ask her if she wants to eat
them there or take them home.

03:13.680 --> 03:17.355
And she has the nerve to complain
about my performance.

03:17.600 --> 03:21.434
Honey, I complain about
your performance all the time...

03:21.680 --> 03:23.272
...and you don't care.

03:23.520 --> 03:26.159
Sometimes, you don't even wake up.

03:27.640 --> 03:30.996
Unlike sex with you,
this is important to me.

03:32.680 --> 03:36.753
The mall manager is threatening to take
away the only joy I have at work.

03:37.080 --> 03:39.196
They're shutting off the plumbing?

03:41.240 --> 03:44.869
The other joy. They're threatening
to take away my parking space.

03:45.080 --> 03:48.789
The one that's closer than the others,
because I've been there the longest.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.073
Oh, so you'll have to walk
an extra half mile. It won't kill you.

03:53.560 --> 03:55.710
Oh, no, Peg, it won't kill me.

03:55.960 --> 03:57.109
That's your job.

03:58.960 --> 04:01.394
But I earned that parking spot.
It's mine.

04:01.680 --> 04:03.910
I started at the end of the lot
by the street...

04:04.120 --> 04:06.315
...where it helps to speak Spanish...

04:06.560 --> 04:10.553
...and 10 years later,
or should I say diez aos...

04:11.360 --> 04:13.635
...they finally put my name
on the best spot.

04:13.880 --> 04:16.029
"Al Budny."

04:16.800 --> 04:19.553
I was so happy.
But now if I insult one more woman...

04:19.760 --> 04:22.228
...before the end of the month
they'll take my spot.

04:22.480 --> 04:25.631
Maybe you should just call in sick
for the next 27 days.

04:25.880 --> 04:28.440
Oh, no, no, no. We can't afford that.

04:28.680 --> 04:29.999
Then they'd dock his pay...

04:30.240 --> 04:33.073
...and we'd be out hundreds
and hundreds of loose change.

04:33.320 --> 04:34.639
Loose change.

04:34.880 --> 04:38.190
Well, all I know is I am not giving up
my parking space without a fight.

04:38.440 --> 04:40.715
Anyone can go three weeks
not insulting a woman.

04:40.960 --> 04:42.552
Betcha $5 you can't.

04:42.800 --> 04:46.873
I will take that bet,
you bonbon-binging bozo!

04:54.520 --> 04:58.229
Mr. Bundy, since you lose your parking
spot if you get one more complaint...

04:58.480 --> 05:01.756
...maybe I should take care of some
of our women customers today.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.513
It's not necessary, Aaron.

05:03.760 --> 05:06.354
I've decided to be nice to women
for the next three weeks.

05:06.600 --> 05:08.511
And no one on God's foul earth...

05:08.760 --> 05:11.513
...will come between me
and my slab of tar.

05:17.120 --> 05:19.509
Don't you have anything else to do?

05:21.600 --> 05:24.068
- All right.
- Hi, Al.

05:24.320 --> 05:27.756
Peggy told me about
your little complaint problem.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.356
- No problem. I'm still under my quota.
- Oh, well, that's very good.

05:31.880 --> 05:35.475
Of course,
I don't see any customers here yet.

05:35.880 --> 05:37.108
Nope.

05:37.320 --> 05:40.437
No one here but us chickens.

05:45.440 --> 05:49.069
Actually, I was just on my way
back from the supermarket.

05:49.320 --> 05:52.118
It seems I was all out of eggs.

05:59.080 --> 06:00.991
Some of the girls will stop by later...

06:01.240 --> 06:03.800
...for what I guess
you could call a hen party.

06:07.440 --> 06:11.274
Oh, come on, Al. You know
you can't keep this up all month.

06:11.520 --> 06:14.910
Eventually, some poor,
calorically challenged woman...

06:15.160 --> 06:18.550
...is gonna come through those doors
and you're gonna insult her...

06:18.800 --> 06:20.791
...because you don't know
the first thing...

06:21.000 --> 06:23.560
...about politically correct behaviour.

06:24.280 --> 06:27.511
What does that have to do
with obnoxious fat women?

06:29.320 --> 06:32.790
Today's obese woman simply feels
that it's her right to be heavy...

06:33.040 --> 06:34.758
...and does not want to be insulted.

06:35.200 --> 06:39.034
So when some moo-cow
thunders in here...

06:39.280 --> 06:41.589
...with a pie under each chin...

06:42.200 --> 06:45.510
...I shouldn't ask if that's the
Star-Spangled Banner she's belching...

06:45.760 --> 06:48.149
...so I know whether to sit or stand?

06:49.280 --> 06:51.111
All I'm saying...

06:51.360 --> 06:54.033
Oh, ye of little deodorant.

06:54.600 --> 06:57.797
- is that you must learn
to treat all people the same.

06:58.320 --> 07:00.356
- Everyone?
- Everyone.

07:00.600 --> 07:02.556
Even midgets?

07:03.680 --> 07:06.240
Everyone, you wienerhead.

07:06.480 --> 07:11.349
Now, I would really love to stay and
see you go down for the third time...

07:11.600 --> 07:13.238
...but I have to get home.

07:13.480 --> 07:16.552
I promised Jefferson...

07:18.160 --> 07:20.958
...l'd cook him a fryer for a dinner.

07:25.280 --> 07:28.670
I so wanted it to be me.

07:29.360 --> 07:31.078
- That was close.
- Yeah.

07:31.320 --> 07:33.550
Oh, no, I'll take care of this one.

07:33.800 --> 07:37.998
Go in the back room and do whatever it
is you do back there for hours on end.

07:38.240 --> 07:41.949
- It's called inventory.
- You call it whatever you want to.

07:44.280 --> 07:47.238
Excuse me, madam.
How may I serve you?

07:47.480 --> 07:50.074
- Do have this in an eight AA?
- Well, let me check.

07:50.320 --> 07:53.471
Oh, well, you'll have to hurry.
I don't have much time.

08:17.240 --> 08:19.390
Excuse me, Miss.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.668
Are you sitting on someone?

08:23.600 --> 08:26.876
- What?
- Oh, oh, no, I'm sorry. Excuse me.

08:27.200 --> 08:28.872
How may I serve you?

08:29.440 --> 08:32.671
How do you think
this would look on me?

08:33.039 --> 08:35.918
I wear a size four.

08:44.159 --> 08:48.312
I have tiny toes, don't you think?

08:50.440 --> 08:52.874
Oh, yes indeed.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.192
For sausages.

08:56.440 --> 09:00.672
Sausages. Sausages.
Sausages. Sausages.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.633
Now, before we get
to the main topic of tonight's meeting...

09:08.120 --> 09:11.874
...which is why can't a man speak his
mind without losing his parking space?

09:12.120 --> 09:13.473
Yeah. That's right.

09:13.720 --> 09:16.439
We'll hear the minutes
of our last meeting.

09:16.680 --> 09:18.955
- Jefferson.
- Thank you.

09:19.640 --> 09:21.631
The meeting was called
to order at 8:00.

09:21.880 --> 09:26.635
We discussed the pros and cons
of the single urinal versus the trough.

09:28.600 --> 09:31.034
At 8: 15 we voted on
whether or not we'd rather do...

09:31.240 --> 09:34.038
...Ann-Margret or Alan Arkin.

09:37.080 --> 09:39.435
That should be Ellen Barkin.

09:42.440 --> 09:45.273
Damn. Dad's in the garage
with a bunch of his friends.

09:45.480 --> 09:47.550
How are we supposed to get
to our refrigerator?

09:48.200 --> 09:50.191
- Are they all men?
- Yeah.

09:50.440 --> 09:52.032
No problem.

09:55.360 --> 09:57.510
There are several
genetic flaws in all men...

09:57.760 --> 10:01.116
...that can be acted on
for reasons of distraction.

10:01.440 --> 10:04.398
I shall demonstrate
the strangest one.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.912
I'm sorry. I didn't know
you guys were in here.

10:11.960 --> 10:13.439
Oh, look.

10:13.680 --> 10:15.352
A football.

10:34.600 --> 10:38.070
Oh, well, come on. We have
important business to discuss.

10:39.720 --> 10:41.039
Now...

10:43.480 --> 10:45.550
Now, as you know...

10:45.800 --> 10:50.032
...I lost my beloved parking space
just because I chose to speak my mind.

10:50.280 --> 10:51.395
- Yeah.
- That's wrong.

10:51.640 --> 10:54.950
Why today, you're supposed to write
to the Organization of Bald People...

10:55.160 --> 10:57.116
...to ask if we can call them
chrome-domes.

10:57.360 --> 10:59.032
- Yeah.
- They're bald.

10:59.280 --> 11:01.794
Then you're supposed to fax
the Fatso Society...

11:02.040 --> 11:05.157
...and ask permission
to assign zip codes to each thigh.

11:05.360 --> 11:06.509
Ridiculous.

11:07.040 --> 11:08.314
Excuse me.

11:08.560 --> 11:12.269
Dad, I just thought you guys might
wanna see this paper airplane I made.

11:12.520 --> 11:15.432
Son, we've all seen
a paper airplane before.

11:15.680 --> 11:17.989
Made out of Miss January?

11:28.040 --> 11:30.838
Hey! Hey! Hey, Roger.

11:31.080 --> 11:32.718
This looks like your wife.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.633
- You think so?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

11:36.160 --> 11:40.790
No, I was looking at this picture
of Dick Butkus on the back.

11:44.240 --> 11:46.674
Come on, guys,
we're in a meeting here.

11:46.920 --> 11:50.071
He's right. We've got work to do.

11:50.440 --> 11:51.793
Now...

11:54.920 --> 11:56.956
What we need to do...

11:57.200 --> 11:59.634
...is to find someone
who can tell us...

11:59.880 --> 12:02.110
...how to fight this insanity.
- That's right.

12:02.360 --> 12:04.032
- We need a man's man.
- Right.

12:04.280 --> 12:06.396
Someone who's always called
his own shots.

12:06.640 --> 12:08.870
A leader to lead us through the '90s.

12:09.120 --> 12:11.156
A man among men.

12:13.280 --> 12:15.874
Ironhead Haynes!

12:16.120 --> 12:17.792
Who's Ironhead Haynes?

12:18.040 --> 12:20.873
The gruffest, toughest man
to ever graduate from Polk High.

12:21.120 --> 12:24.192
He had a beard in the seventh grade.

12:24.880 --> 12:26.677
And a wife.

12:27.520 --> 12:30.990
Took out his own appendix
with a Pocket Fisherman.

12:31.560 --> 12:34.028
He'd have been a great
football player for Polk High...

12:34.280 --> 12:37.272
...but he refused
to take off his spurs.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.796
He wore boots to play football?

12:40.040 --> 12:43.112
No boots, just spurs.

12:43.960 --> 12:48.476
Well, you know, they can't all be
football stars like we were.

12:49.200 --> 12:52.033
Or cheerleaders, like I was.

12:54.920 --> 12:58.310
Hey, I did some
very dangerous flips.

13:01.480 --> 13:02.799
And I...

13:03.040 --> 13:05.474
I helped fire the cannon
after each touchdown.

13:05.720 --> 13:07.472
- Yeah?
- Was that you?

13:09.760 --> 13:12.513
Well, where can we find
this Ironhead Haynes?

13:12.760 --> 13:14.671
Rumour has it he lives alone...

13:14.920 --> 13:18.595
...on top of the highest mountain
in Illinois.

13:19.240 --> 13:20.673
Well, then we'll go tomorrow...

13:20.920 --> 13:23.229
...and seek his guidance.
- Good idea.

13:23.480 --> 13:29.112
Al, I need someone to move the
clothes dryer away from the wall!

13:29.360 --> 13:32.830
- Coming, dear.
- Okay, we're out of here.

13:40.040 --> 13:41.553
Hey, wait a second.

13:41.800 --> 13:44.633
We don't have any clothes dryer!

13:46.280 --> 13:48.316
Did I say clothes dryer?

13:48.560 --> 13:52.030
I meant, "Take out the trash."

14:02.880 --> 14:04.518
Hey, wait.

14:04.760 --> 14:08.833
Look, how do we know that Ironhead
Haynes is even up there?

14:09.080 --> 14:11.594
Yeah. This legend
could just be made-up.

14:11.800 --> 14:13.028
That's true, Al.

14:13.240 --> 14:16.312
He could be as phoney
as your wife's hair colour.

14:17.640 --> 14:20.154
Or as real as your wife's
hair colour, Roger.

14:20.400 --> 14:23.312
I know it's real because
it matches her moustache!

14:24.000 --> 14:26.878
Okay, okay, come on, come on!

14:30.160 --> 14:31.718
Look, guys...

14:31.960 --> 14:33.791
...are we going on or not?

14:34.040 --> 14:38.113
Of course we're going on. Name me
one good reason why we shouldn't.

14:41.200 --> 14:44.272
- Well, I'm going on!
- Yeah, well, I'm...

14:44.520 --> 14:46.238
Staying here.

14:46.480 --> 14:50.792
- We'll see you when you get back.
- Yeah, have a nice trip.

14:51.040 --> 14:52.598
Thank you...

14:52.840 --> 14:55.195
...candy-asses.

15:01.200 --> 15:05.318
Oh, well, I don't know about you guys,
but I'm no candy-ass.

15:07.480 --> 15:09.835
Well, think we'll ever see him again?

15:10.160 --> 15:11.559
It's hard to say.

15:11.800 --> 15:13.791
This mountain has killed before.

15:14.040 --> 15:15.553
It could kill again.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.712
- Trail mix, anyone?
- Yeah.

15:20.280 --> 15:21.872
Raisins are mine.

15:38.200 --> 15:42.910
- Well, you must be Ironhead Haynes.
- Yep. And you must be some idiot...

15:43.120 --> 15:46.749
...that don't know there's a road
on the other side of this mountain.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.797
Al Bundy. Polk High.

15:53.040 --> 15:54.314
And I brought you some gifts.

15:54.560 --> 15:57.996
Me and my buddies wanted to give
you a token of our esteem.

15:58.240 --> 16:00.629
In here I got some Beer Nuts...

16:00.880 --> 16:03.348
...and there's a tire gauge.

16:03.600 --> 16:08.116
And here's the football that I scored
my first touchdown with at Polk High.

16:08.360 --> 16:10.669
So go on, go out.

16:11.040 --> 16:12.314
Ready?

16:16.120 --> 16:19.874
- Not my game.
- Well, then...

16:20.240 --> 16:21.753
...the Beer Nuts can be from me.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.958
Oh, and here's something here...

16:25.200 --> 16:27.430
...Jefferson didn't know
what to get you so...

16:27.680 --> 16:30.638
...he got you a silk shirt, you know.

16:31.680 --> 16:34.240
I've never had one of these before.

16:40.040 --> 16:41.871
It's not bad.

16:42.680 --> 16:44.352
Now, what can I do for you?

16:44.600 --> 16:46.192
Well, Ironhead...

16:46.440 --> 16:50.718
...things have gotten pretty rough
for us freethinkers back in civilization.

16:50.960 --> 16:53.713
Old people getting mad at you
if you call them old.

16:53.960 --> 16:57.316
Foreign people getting mad at you
if you tell them to go home.

16:57.640 --> 17:01.519
You'd be surprised. The slightest
thing will set a gimp off these days.

17:01.760 --> 17:04.115
I suppose that's why
you moved up here, isn't it?

17:04.960 --> 17:08.714
No, I moved up here to get in touch
with my feminine side.

17:11.240 --> 17:13.959
I'm kidding. I'm just teasing.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.919
Well, unfortunately,
many can't move to a mountain...

17:17.119 --> 17:20.078
...because they're married to one.

17:20.319 --> 17:25.633
But we need your wisdom to help guide
up through our daily hell.

17:25.880 --> 17:28.189
Tell us what you believe.

17:28.440 --> 17:32.433
Well, I believe that when you gotta spit,
you gotta spit.

17:32.680 --> 17:34.398
And right now I gotta spit.

17:34.640 --> 17:36.278
Oh, this is good stuff.

17:45.440 --> 17:48.159
And I believe that everybody's
that got more money...

17:48.400 --> 17:51.676
...than they can hold in both hands
ought to give it all to me.

17:52.720 --> 17:58.192
I believe that all animals were put
on this earth to make faces at me.

17:59.440 --> 18:03.991
I really believe that that damn doctor
didn't have to put this plate in my head.

18:04.560 --> 18:06.391
Well...

18:06.760 --> 18:08.990
...doctor knows best.

18:10.240 --> 18:13.869
But tell us, what can we do
to fight back?

18:14.360 --> 18:17.955
Well, I don't know,
maybe this song will say it the best.

18:23.040 --> 18:24.951
Nothing

18:31.960 --> 18:33.234
That...

18:33.680 --> 18:36.638
That's it? That's the message?

18:36.880 --> 18:40.475
That's it. You know,
men like us are dinosaurs.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.757
Real, live, dead dinosaurs.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.879
Listen, I got buddies down here waiting
for you to give us a plan of action.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.391
My football.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.512
I can't just tell them it's all over.

18:53.720 --> 18:55.472
That life as we know it is gone.

18:55.720 --> 18:57.278
And we'll never be like this again.

18:57.520 --> 19:00.717
Well, if it isn't Mr. Sunshine.

19:01.320 --> 19:04.915
The only problem with being a dinosaur
is there ain't no future in it.

19:05.160 --> 19:07.754
But there is one hell of a past.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.515
Now, what you need to do this act
like the mighty tyrannosaurus...

19:11.760 --> 19:13.557
...and leave deep prints.

19:14.160 --> 19:17.311
Leave deep prints.

19:17.960 --> 19:21.077
That's it. Let them know
that you've been there.

19:21.320 --> 19:22.673
I got it!

19:22.920 --> 19:26.037
But wait a second. What if my
buddies don't believe that I met you?

19:26.280 --> 19:30.114
Is there something here that you can
give me to prove that we met?

19:30.360 --> 19:32.794
Well, how about that sack of flour?

19:33.040 --> 19:37.238
Well, anything without
mealy bugs in it?

19:38.280 --> 19:40.236
I guess that leaves my beard out.

19:41.400 --> 19:43.516
All I got left now is this guitar...

19:43.760 --> 19:47.912
...that my dearly beloved,
departed grandmother left me.

19:48.160 --> 19:51.550
And my Victoria's Secret catalogue.

19:54.720 --> 19:57.188
Here, I can't give up
my sunshine.

20:01.080 --> 20:05.073
Well, thank you, Ironhead.

20:05.320 --> 20:07.595
And I'll see to it
that your legend lives on.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.798
You're still my idol
because you're afraid of nothing.

20:11.040 --> 20:13.793
Well, now,
that's not necessarily true.

20:14.040 --> 20:16.679
I'm deathly afraid of magnets.

20:16.920 --> 20:21.152
If a big one was to roll by here right
now, my head is history.

20:21.400 --> 20:24.312
I suggest that you get on back down
that mountain in a hurry.

20:24.560 --> 20:26.312
Why? Is it gonna rain?

20:26.560 --> 20:30.189
No, but I do feel
another spit coming on.

20:36.840 --> 20:39.229
You think something horrible's
happened to Al?

20:39.480 --> 20:42.074
Why would you say
such a terrible thing?

20:42.320 --> 20:46.393
Well, because if he's dead,
we could eat his croissant.

20:46.640 --> 20:48.676
- He's dead.
- He's dead.

20:51.400 --> 20:54.870
Don't eat the croissant!

21:08.760 --> 21:10.990
Al, is that you?

21:11.520 --> 21:13.192
It is I.

21:13.440 --> 21:16.398
I have come from Ironhead Haynes...

21:18.720 --> 21:20.597
...with words for hardworking people...

21:20.840 --> 21:24.469
...who don't give a rat's ass
about political correctness.

21:27.160 --> 21:28.752
Rule number one:

21:29.000 --> 21:32.913
It's okay to call hooters "knockers"
and sometimes "snack trays."

21:35.720 --> 21:39.315
Rule two: It is wrong to be French.

21:41.760 --> 21:47.153
Rule three: It is okay to put all bad
people in a giant meat grinder.

21:47.680 --> 21:50.911
Rule four: Lawyers, see rule three.

21:53.040 --> 21:57.716
It is okay to drive a gas guzzler
if it helps you get babes.

21:58.240 --> 22:01.869
Everyone should car pool except me.

22:02.440 --> 22:05.512
Bring back the word "stewardesses."

22:05.760 --> 22:09.150
Synchronized swimming
is not a sport.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.833
Mud wrestling is a sport.

22:13.080 --> 22:16.117
Those are your 10 commandments.

22:17.040 --> 22:18.792
But, Al, that's only nine.

22:19.800 --> 22:23.076
Those are you nine commandments.

22:23.720 --> 22:25.039
Well, I can live with that.

22:25.280 --> 22:27.748
I say we all go back
and spread the word.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.879
And help Al get what appears
to be flour out of his hair.

22:32.120 --> 22:33.872
It's stupid to start back now.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.429
It'll be pitch-black
before we reach the bottom.

22:36.680 --> 22:39.274
If we're gonna stay here
we'd better keep this fire going.

22:39.480 --> 22:42.074
Now, does anybody have something
we can throw on the fire?

22:42.280 --> 22:44.748
All I have is my Victoria's Secret
catalogue.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.468
- Yeah, me too.
- Me too.

22:47.720 --> 22:51.156
Well, then all we have is these...

22:51.400 --> 22:54.517
...or these sacred commandments.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.718
Yeah. Give me that back.

22:56.960 --> 23:00.475
Sinners, blasphemers,
heathens, sinners...

23:00.920 --> 23:02.831
...hooters. Hooters.
