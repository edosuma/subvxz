WEBVTT

00:06.354 --> 00:08.312
- Okay, so it looks like
everyone agrees

00:08.356 --> 00:10.488
that Paul Rudd is the celebrity
with the cutest butt.

00:10.532 --> 00:12.447
So no more fighting about this,
okay, guys?

00:12.490 --> 00:13.926
- So I guess
we're all just pretending

00:13.970 --> 00:15.145
that Dennis Leary
doesn't exist.

00:15.189 --> 00:16.494
That's fine.
- Next up,

00:16.538 --> 00:18.670
we are switching over
electronics

00:18.714 --> 00:20.542
from SuperCloud
to the new Zephra products.

00:20.585 --> 00:22.761
- Ah, Sand--Sandra,
I am gonna have you

00:22.805 --> 00:24.285
set up the display today.

00:24.328 --> 00:26.026
I scouted a Best Buy
and picked up

00:26.069 --> 00:28.419
some really out there ideas.

00:28.463 --> 00:29.942
- Oh, Glenn,
do you think we're ready?

00:29.986 --> 00:31.466
- We'll see.

00:31.509 --> 00:34.686
Um, and Jonah and Justine,
you get to help out tomorrow

00:34.730 --> 00:35.905
when the rest of the shipment
comes in.

00:35.948 --> 00:38.516
- Oh, I'm actually--
I'm not here tomorrow.

00:38.560 --> 00:42.129
- Oh, yes, um--I forgot to
take you off the schedule.

00:42.172 --> 00:45.741
Sorry, um--uh, Sayid,
um, you're gonna have to

00:45.784 --> 00:47.395
come in a little early tomorrow
to help out.

00:47.438 --> 00:48.700
- I have to come in early

00:48.744 --> 00:50.833
because Jonah doesn't feel
like working?

00:50.876 --> 00:52.443
- Yeah, and you wouldn't
give me the day off

00:52.487 --> 00:53.879
to Skype with my boyfriend.

00:53.923 --> 00:56.534
The time difference with Ghana
is so tricky.

00:56.578 --> 00:58.710
We haven't even gotten
a chance to talk yet.

00:58.754 --> 01:02.236
- I'm actually going to
a meeting for Raise the Wage.

01:02.279 --> 01:04.542
So this is really
to help all of us.

01:04.586 --> 01:06.283
You know what would help us

01:06.327 --> 01:08.198
is if we were all
sleeping with the boss.

01:08.242 --> 01:09.286
- Mm-hmm.
- Then we could

01:09.330 --> 01:10.635
all take a day off
whenever we wanted.

01:10.679 --> 01:12.420
- Well, someone
would still have to work.

01:12.463 --> 01:14.248
So who doesn't wanna
sleep with Amy?

01:14.291 --> 01:17.120
- Okay, no, Tina,
that's not--

01:17.164 --> 01:18.687
Oh, really?
Sayid, wow.

01:18.730 --> 01:19.992
You'd be lucky.

01:20.036 --> 01:22.604
Anyway, I don't give Jonah
special treatment.

01:22.647 --> 01:23.735
- It's not just Jonah.

01:23.779 --> 01:24.997
It's all your favorites.

01:25.041 --> 01:27.217
Glenn, Garrett, Cheyenne

01:27.261 --> 01:29.045
- Oh, Amy,
I'm one of your favorites?

01:29.089 --> 01:30.394
- No.
- Oh.

01:30.438 --> 01:32.875
- I mean, no,
I don't have favorites.

01:32.918 --> 01:36.096
- Okay, then who here was
invited to Emma's quinceaÃ±era?

01:36.139 --> 01:38.402
- Okay, no more raising hands.

01:38.446 --> 01:41.013
- I be corporate HR
would love to hear

01:41.057 --> 01:42.450
about the favoritism
at this store.

01:42.493 --> 01:44.365
- He's right, they would.
- There's no favoritism.

01:44.408 --> 01:45.583
- No, guys,

01:45.627 --> 01:47.890
there's no need to call HR,
okay?

01:47.933 --> 01:49.892
Jonah, I'm not taking you
off the schedule.

01:49.935 --> 01:51.937
So you're gonna have to
find someone yourself to cover.

01:51.981 --> 01:53.504
- That's totally fair,

01:53.548 --> 01:55.941
and I'm sure I can find
somebody else to cover for me.

01:55.985 --> 01:57.726
Sarah?
- No.

01:57.769 --> 01:59.467
- Jesus, Sarah,
at least take a minute

01:59.510 --> 02:03.253
to pretend to look
at your calendar or something.

02:11.392 --> 02:13.481
- Okay. Here's the plan.

02:13.524 --> 02:15.439
Myrtle has passed.
Rest in peace.

02:15.483 --> 02:18.094
Miss her like cray, but now
I can quit the vision center

02:18.138 --> 02:19.574
and be your new assistant.

02:19.617 --> 02:21.967
- Mateo, you know it's not
as simple as that.

02:22.011 --> 02:23.621
- I can't work for Dan anymore.

02:23.665 --> 02:26.363
Every night, he calls me
from the McDonald's drive-thru

02:26.407 --> 02:28.017
begging me
to talk him out of it.

02:28.060 --> 02:29.714
And I try,
but he goes through.

02:29.758 --> 02:31.194
And then it's just
ten minutes of him

02:31.238 --> 02:34.676
sobbing and eating
and I have to forgive him

02:34.719 --> 02:36.068
every night.

02:36.112 --> 02:38.984
- Mateo, I really could
use the help right now,

02:39.028 --> 02:41.073
but I can't hire you.

02:41.117 --> 02:43.032
Zephra still uses E-Verify.

02:43.075 --> 02:45.339
- This is so unfair.
- I know.

02:48.211 --> 02:50.170
-  Oh, my God.

02:50.213 --> 02:51.910
I have to give Dan's wife
a lift.

02:51.954 --> 02:54.826
To Fort Wayne, Indiana?

02:54.870 --> 02:56.306
Where is that?

02:56.350 --> 02:58.308
- Okay, no, no.
Mateo, no.

02:58.352 --> 03:00.267
That's crazy.
You can't do that.

03:00.310 --> 03:02.617
We'll figure something out.
I mean,

03:02.660 --> 03:04.923
maybe if there were
some kind of way to--

03:08.231 --> 03:09.450
- Do you actually have a plan

03:09.493 --> 03:11.016
or are you just not telling me
to be mysterious

03:11.060 --> 03:12.757
or do you have, like,
no idea.

03:12.801 --> 03:15.195
- I don't know.
It's just too risky.

03:17.762 --> 03:20.374
- Okay, I'm gonna pee
and come back.

03:21.940 --> 03:23.290
- What the hell is all this?

03:23.333 --> 03:25.640
- Um, it's the display
for the new Zephra products.

03:25.683 --> 03:27.816
- Yeah, it's also
a shoplifter's paradise.

03:27.859 --> 03:29.034
Nothing's locked down.

03:29.078 --> 03:30.732
This phone, swipe.

03:30.775 --> 03:32.690
This tablet, swipe.

03:32.734 --> 03:34.736
This--I don't know
what that is.

03:34.779 --> 03:36.259
- It's a digital
picture frame.

03:36.303 --> 03:38.043
It has Wi-Fi, so you can upload
right from your phone.

03:38.087 --> 03:39.349
- Really? Cool.

03:39.393 --> 03:41.482
Anyway, swipe.

03:41.525 --> 03:43.440
Look, this is the most
expensive merch in the store.

03:43.484 --> 03:44.485
I can't have Zephra thinking

03:44.528 --> 03:46.400
I'm running a buffet for
thieves.

03:46.443 --> 03:49.185
- Right, but, um--
It's actually Glenn's idea

03:49.229 --> 03:51.231
and he's Floor Supervisor now,

03:51.274 --> 03:53.276
so maybe I should ask him.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.886
- The only thing
you need to ask Glenn

03:54.930 --> 03:57.628
is how a man manages to make it
to 60 without hitting puberty.

03:57.672 --> 04:01.241
This is my domain,
and I say take it down.

04:03.417 --> 04:05.810
- Did you also want me
to ask about the puberty?

04:05.854 --> 04:08.857
- So then on your books,
Mateo would still

04:08.900 --> 04:11.729
get paid by the vision center,
but he'd work with me.

04:11.773 --> 04:14.471
And Eugene would
stay on my payroll,

04:14.515 --> 04:15.951
but he'd work with you.

04:15.994 --> 04:17.561
- But we had a good thing
going here.

04:17.605 --> 04:19.433
I mean, we were vibing.
It's like--

04:19.476 --> 04:20.738
- Yes.
- But I just don't know

04:20.782 --> 04:23.393
anything about this guy.
- I'm Eugene.

04:23.437 --> 04:26.570
- He's Eugene!
He's the best!

04:26.614 --> 04:30.052
He's, um, uh--positive.
- Mm-hmm.

04:30.095 --> 04:31.749
And, uh--

04:31.793 --> 04:36.754
- He is, uh--so tall.
- So tall.

04:36.798 --> 04:40.454
- Hm. Eugene, could you get
those boxes off

04:40.497 --> 04:42.891
from the top shelf,
and take them to the back?

04:42.934 --> 04:45.110
- Sure thing.

04:45.154 --> 04:47.591
- Hmm. Good extension.

04:47.635 --> 04:50.768
Nice wide stance.
- Uh-huh.

04:50.812 --> 04:52.596
- The kid's good.

04:52.640 --> 04:53.858
I'm sold.
- Good.

04:53.902 --> 04:55.991
- Yay!
- Great. Awesome.

04:56.034 --> 04:59.168
And, um, also, you know,
we should probably

04:59.211 --> 05:00.822
keep all of this
on the down low.

05:00.865 --> 05:03.346
Just the fewer people who know,
probably the better.

05:03.390 --> 05:04.695
- Of course.
I mean,

05:04.739 --> 05:08.830
I actually find
shared secrets very thrilling.

05:09.744 --> 05:11.702
- Okay.

05:11.746 --> 05:13.530
- Oh, sure.
I can cover your shift, um,

05:13.574 --> 05:15.358
if you can do me
a huge favor.

05:15.402 --> 05:17.186
- Uh, yeah, sure.
Maybe. What is it?

05:17.229 --> 05:18.927
- Okay, if the cops call you,

05:18.970 --> 05:22.496
just say that you were with Bo
all night last Thursday.

05:22.539 --> 05:24.976
Just if they call.
There's, like, an 80% chance.

05:25.020 --> 05:27.849
- That's high.
That's a high chance.

05:27.892 --> 05:29.894
- I'll cover your shift
if you work for me next Friday.

05:29.938 --> 05:31.853
- Oh, great.
Okay, great, yeah.

05:31.896 --> 05:33.376
What's--what's going on Friday?

05:33.420 --> 05:34.812
- Oh, nothing. Just having
a little thing at my place.

05:34.856 --> 05:36.466
- Oh, you're, uh--
you're doing a thing.

05:36.510 --> 05:37.685
That's--that's cool. Cool.

05:37.728 --> 05:39.948
So yeah, I'll just, uh--
I'll cover for you

05:39.991 --> 05:41.776
while you're having your thing.

05:41.819 --> 05:44.692
And I'll--I'll be here.
- That's how this works.

05:44.735 --> 05:48.913
- He wasn't at the ravine.
He wasn't at the ravine.

05:48.957 --> 05:50.959
He wasn't--
he wasn't at the ravine.

05:51.002 --> 05:53.527
Okay, hi, cops.

05:53.570 --> 05:55.877
- Okay, so I swiped this
digital picture frame

05:55.920 --> 05:57.226
from electronics
because it'll look

05:57.269 --> 06:00.185
really cute on your desk.
- Ooh. Yes, it would.

06:00.229 --> 06:01.752
Oh, it's gonna be so nice

06:01.796 --> 06:03.275
to have an assistant
who actually helps.

06:03.319 --> 06:04.451
Myrtle used to just cut out

06:04.494 --> 06:06.191
pictures of horses
from magazines

06:06.235 --> 06:07.628
and tape them to my computer.

06:07.671 --> 06:11.545
- Uh, whoa, did you just say
Mateo's your new assistant?

06:11.588 --> 06:12.850
- How's that possible?

06:12.894 --> 06:15.244
I thought
he couldn't work for Cloud 9.

06:15.287 --> 06:16.941
- Um--
- Well, uh--

06:16.985 --> 06:20.858
I just found out that, um,
I got a work permit.

06:20.902 --> 06:22.512
My lawyer called me
this morning.

06:22.556 --> 06:24.209
I just haven't had time
to tell anybody.

06:24.253 --> 06:26.603
- Ah Mateo, that's awesome!

06:26.647 --> 06:28.518
But Amy, that's bung.

06:28.562 --> 06:30.520
I mean, you say
you don't play favorites,

06:30.564 --> 06:32.261
but then you give
the sweet assistant job

06:32.304 --> 06:33.436
to your brother-in-law.

06:33.480 --> 06:35.786
- Okay, Mateo is not
my brother-in-law.

06:35.830 --> 06:38.441
He and Eric
are just boyfriends.

06:38.485 --> 06:39.616
- Boyfriends?

06:39.660 --> 06:40.835
Did he say boyfriends?

06:40.878 --> 06:41.836
- Well, I'd want the job, too.

06:41.879 --> 06:43.707
I've been dying for a desk job.

06:43.751 --> 06:45.622
At least give us a chance
to interview for it.

06:45.666 --> 06:48.364
- Yeah, come on.
- Or maybe we should call HR

06:48.408 --> 06:50.584
after all.
- Look, you guys,

06:50.627 --> 06:52.934
I just--I didn't realize

06:52.977 --> 06:55.763
that there would be
so much excitement for the job,

06:55.806 --> 06:59.593
So seeing as it's
not finalized--

06:59.636 --> 07:01.638
- I'm sorry, it's not.
- Nope.

07:01.682 --> 07:03.901
Uh, let's--let's open this up.

07:03.945 --> 07:07.078
- Yes!
- Uh, anyone can apply.

07:07.122 --> 07:08.515
- Anyone.

07:11.039 --> 07:12.649
- Okay, let's start
by hearing

07:12.693 --> 07:14.608
everybody's work experience.

07:14.651 --> 07:15.826
You first, Justine.

07:15.870 --> 07:17.567
- Oh, okay. Well, um,
I have worked here

07:17.611 --> 07:18.873
for over three years,

07:18.916 --> 07:20.091
and before that
I was a dog groomer

07:20.135 --> 07:21.528
So I guess you could say

07:21.571 --> 07:23.399
I am good with
hot-tempered bitches.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.619
I'm sorry. I'm very nervous.

07:27.751 --> 07:32.147
- No, thank you, Justine,
for answering the question.

07:32.190 --> 07:33.888
Okay, Marcus, you next.

07:33.931 --> 07:35.585
- Let's see, before Cloud 9,

07:35.629 --> 07:37.805
I did some office management
for my dad's business,

07:37.848 --> 07:40.198
mostly answering phones
and filing.

07:40.242 --> 07:43.114
- Oh, so--so, like,
assistant stuff?

07:43.158 --> 07:45.203
- Yeah.
- Wow. That's fun

07:45.247 --> 07:46.814
and surprising.

07:46.857 --> 07:48.598
- Okay, Mateo, uh, you?

07:48.642 --> 07:51.862
- I, um, can type
100 words per minute.

07:51.906 --> 07:54.474
- Oh, wow.
- And I am currently

07:54.517 --> 07:58.652
on a three month trial of the
full Microsoft Office Suite.

08:02.786 --> 08:04.309
- Oh, hey, look at that.

08:04.353 --> 08:06.224
Triscuit sale, two-for-one.

08:06.268 --> 08:07.922
Hey, you've got
a thing coming up.

08:07.965 --> 08:09.837
Is that, uh--do you need--
do you need snacks

08:09.880 --> 08:12.013
or is it, like,
a non-snack gathering?

08:12.056 --> 08:14.189
- Okay, buddy,
you're being weird.

08:14.232 --> 08:16.626
My thing next Friday
is just a few dudes

08:16.670 --> 08:17.671
that you don't even know.

08:17.714 --> 08:18.759
No work people
have been invited.

08:18.802 --> 08:19.847
So just relax.

08:19.890 --> 08:22.284
- Okay. Is--is Randy invited?

08:22.327 --> 08:23.677
- Yeah, sure.
Randy's gonna be there.

08:23.720 --> 08:26.288
- I know Randy. I used to
say hi to him all the time

08:26.331 --> 08:27.550
back when we lived together.

08:27.594 --> 08:29.247
In fact, he even asked me
to move my car once

08:29.291 --> 08:30.553
'cause I was blocking him in.

08:30.597 --> 08:31.728
- Yeah, I just don't like
mixing my worlds.

08:31.772 --> 08:33.600
I don't bug you
for hanging out with Amy

08:33.643 --> 08:35.558
and her kids all the time.
- I'm not always

08:35.602 --> 08:36.951
hanging out with Amy.

08:36.994 --> 08:38.735
- Look, I'm not saying it
like it's a bad thing.

08:38.779 --> 08:41.085
It's just you got
your own stuff going on,

08:41.129 --> 08:42.957
I got my own stuff going on.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.480
To each their own stuff.
It's great.

08:44.524 --> 08:47.962
- But I--I have room
for more stuff.

08:48.005 --> 08:49.354
I'm like a hatchback.

08:49.398 --> 08:51.443
You can always cram more in me.

08:54.055 --> 08:56.623
Don't--don't make it dirty.

08:57.275 --> 08:59.756
- Sandra, what are you doing?

08:59.800 --> 09:01.279
- Dina said this was
a bad idea

09:01.323 --> 09:02.803
and told me to redo
the display.

09:02.846 --> 09:04.674
- Oh, Dina said that.

09:04.718 --> 09:05.980
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:06.023 --> 09:08.504
- She can't stand
that I have authority now,

09:08.548 --> 09:10.898
so she's trying to cut me off
at the thighs.

09:10.941 --> 09:12.639
Well, I'm the floor supervisor,

09:12.682 --> 09:14.989
so--so put it all back,

09:15.032 --> 09:16.860
and make it bigger.

09:16.904 --> 09:18.079
- What do you mean bigger?

09:18.122 --> 09:20.211
- I mean bigger!

09:23.432 --> 09:26.130
- Bigger.

09:26.174 --> 09:29.177
- So, looks like we have
a last-minute applicant.

09:29.220 --> 09:31.179
Cheyenne.
- Hey.

09:31.222 --> 09:33.442
Yeah, I really want this job,

09:33.485 --> 09:35.313
but now that
I see Mateo's here,

09:35.357 --> 09:36.706
it's like, what's the point?

09:36.750 --> 09:39.579
I should just give up now.
We all should.

09:41.885 --> 09:43.974
- Okay, thank you, Cheyenne.

09:44.018 --> 09:47.108
All right, let's continue
with hypothetical scenarios.

09:47.151 --> 09:51.416
Uh, Mateo, if I were to ask you
to file a 1038 form,

09:51.460 --> 09:53.070
that would require you to...

09:53.114 --> 09:54.550
- Fax a copy
of the incident report

09:54.594 --> 09:56.900
along with the updated
employee information.

09:56.944 --> 09:57.988
Boom.

09:58.032 --> 09:59.729
- Uh, yeah.

09:59.773 --> 10:01.426
Okay, uh, good.

10:01.470 --> 10:03.341
- Hold up, you're forgetting
that you have to

10:03.385 --> 10:05.039
give Linda in legal a heads up

10:05.082 --> 10:06.997
'cause you need a 1022.

10:07.041 --> 10:09.521
I've had to deal with a lot of
accidents in the warehouse.

10:09.565 --> 10:11.480
Especially before
Michael was fired.

10:11.523 --> 10:14.657
That guy loved his nail gun.

10:14.701 --> 10:16.572
And heroin.

10:16.616 --> 10:21.403
- Well, uh, Marcus,
that is all very correct.

10:21.446 --> 10:22.970
- Well, Mateo got
the first part

10:23.013 --> 10:25.886
of the question right, he just
biffed the important part.

10:25.929 --> 10:28.236
- So glad you're here,
Cheyenne.

10:28.279 --> 10:30.064
- I thought Mateo
was a shoo-in.

10:30.107 --> 10:32.196
- Yeah, so did I
until Marcus started

10:32.240 --> 10:34.024
acting like not an idiot.

10:34.068 --> 10:35.591
And now I can't just pick Mateo

10:35.635 --> 10:37.375
without everyone thinking
I'm playing favorites

10:37.419 --> 10:39.029
the way they thought I was
giving you special treatment

10:39.073 --> 10:40.465
just 'cause
you're my boyfriend.

10:40.509 --> 10:41.989
- You know what? I'm tired
of everybody thinking of me

10:42.032 --> 10:43.555
as just your boyfriend, okay?

10:43.599 --> 10:45.253
Even Garrett sees me like that.

10:45.296 --> 10:46.384
He thinks I spend
all of my time

10:46.428 --> 10:47.690
with you and the kids.

10:47.734 --> 10:49.910
- Well, I mean,
you kinda do.

10:49.953 --> 10:52.129
- Oh, come on.
- But if you wanted to, like,

10:52.173 --> 10:54.001
spend more time
with your boys,

10:54.044 --> 10:55.480
I'd be totally cool
with that.

10:55.524 --> 10:57.178
Do you have boys?
- Yes.

10:57.221 --> 10:58.396
Yes, I have boys.

10:58.440 --> 10:59.920
I have lots of boys.

10:59.963 --> 11:01.617
Shane.
- Mm.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.837
- Grant. Julien.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.403
- Julien, Emma's French tutor?

11:05.447 --> 11:08.276
- We connected.
We both love the cuisine.

11:09.233 --> 11:11.235
- âª Ooh, baby

11:11.279 --> 11:14.412
âª Really want you
in my world âª

11:14.456 --> 11:16.719
âª Step, hey, girl

11:16.763 --> 11:19.069
- Hey, Garrett.

11:19.113 --> 11:21.202
Hey.
What's up?

11:21.245 --> 11:22.594
- I forgot my lunch,
so I'm just

11:22.638 --> 11:24.161
grabbing something
from the cafÃ©.

11:24.205 --> 11:26.642
- Ah, come on. You don't wanna
put this garbage in your body.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.209
Not garbage.

11:28.252 --> 11:30.341
Enjoy your--
your cheese dog, sir.

11:30.385 --> 11:32.909
Uh, anyway. I was gonna
take Amy out to lunch.

11:32.953 --> 11:34.868
But guess who I'm taking
instead?

11:34.911 --> 11:38.959
- Oh. God, why?

11:39.002 --> 11:42.136
- Are you kidding me?

11:42.179 --> 11:43.659
- Dina, don't you dare.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.401
- As assistant manager,
I have authority over Sandra.

11:46.444 --> 11:49.491
- Uh, I also have authority
over Sandra

11:49.534 --> 11:51.232
because you and I
are equal now.

11:51.275 --> 11:54.061
- Oh, please.
Sandra, take it down.

11:54.104 --> 11:57.020
- Sandra, no.
You leave it up.

11:57.064 --> 11:58.195
- If you don't listen to me,

11:58.239 --> 11:59.806
I will write you up
for insubordination.

11:59.849 --> 12:01.546
- Oh, too late, 'cause I'm
already writing you up.

12:01.590 --> 12:03.940
- No, no, no, no.
- Not if I get there first!

12:05.202 --> 12:06.682
- What is the form number?
- B-17.

12:06.726 --> 12:07.770
- Thank you.
Did they change it?

12:07.814 --> 12:09.293
- Yes, they did.
- Is that gonna count

12:09.337 --> 12:10.904
as one write up or two?

12:10.947 --> 12:12.296
- One!
- Two!

12:12.340 --> 12:13.733
- Sounds good.

12:16.866 --> 12:18.476
- Okay, uh, Justine.

12:18.520 --> 12:20.261
I would say
that you should be able

12:20.304 --> 12:22.437
to ask the vendor when
the shipment will be delivered

12:22.480 --> 12:24.700
without making a joke
about his package.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.267
- Okay. Got it.

12:26.310 --> 12:29.705
Yeah, I'm still trying to learn
all your little quirks, so--

12:29.749 --> 12:32.795
- Okay, Mateo, you're up.

12:32.839 --> 12:36.407
Why don't you
call our produce vendor

12:36.451 --> 12:38.758
and check the date
of our next delivery.

12:42.500 --> 12:43.806
- Good afternoon, ma'am.

12:43.850 --> 12:44.981
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

12:46.461 --> 12:49.899
You have a uniquely high voice.

12:49.943 --> 12:52.684
I didn't know that could happen
after a stroke.

12:52.728 --> 12:54.382
I do believe you. I--

12:54.425 --> 12:57.428
My voice just got higher.
I'm not mocking you.

12:57.472 --> 12:59.213
Hello? Hello?

13:02.564 --> 13:04.348
- Whoa, I can't go after that.

13:04.392 --> 13:06.698
That was so good.

13:06.742 --> 13:08.222
- I got this.

13:11.399 --> 13:13.880
Okay.

13:13.923 --> 13:17.187
Jeanie! It's Marcus
from the warehouse.

13:17.231 --> 13:19.842
Hey, I was calling to see
if I could check

13:19.886 --> 13:21.844
when that shipment's
gonna be coming in.

13:21.888 --> 13:24.847
Is there any chance we could
push that up to Wednesday?

13:24.891 --> 13:27.197
Oh. Jeanie in a bottle.

13:27.241 --> 13:29.199
'Cause you're making
wishes come true.

13:29.243 --> 13:30.810
Buh-bye.

13:32.420 --> 13:34.814
- Did you actually just get
them to move the shipment up?

13:34.857 --> 13:37.294
- The key is to talk
directly to the truck drivers.

13:37.338 --> 13:39.427
Now, I have
a great relationship with them

13:39.470 --> 13:40.776
since I work in the warehouse.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.560
- Oh, do you work
in a warehouse, Marcus?

13:42.604 --> 13:44.432
I didn't know because
you only mentioned it,

13:44.475 --> 13:46.086
like, a million times.

13:46.129 --> 13:47.609
- Okay, that doesn't even
make sense.

13:47.652 --> 13:49.654
There's no way I could've
said a million words.

13:49.698 --> 13:50.873
That would've taken years.

13:59.447 --> 14:01.623
- Dina doesn't want me
putting items on the floor.

14:01.666 --> 14:03.755
Well, I am gonna show her
just how many items

14:03.799 --> 14:04.800
I can put on the floor.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.019
I'm gonna put out thousands.

14:06.062 --> 14:07.890
- There's only 78 tablets.

14:07.934 --> 14:10.197
- Well, then we'll put out 78,

14:10.240 --> 14:12.025
but it'll be the most 78
you've ever seen.

14:12.068 --> 14:13.896
- Oh, absolutely not.

14:13.940 --> 14:15.855
- Get out of my way.
Come on!

14:15.898 --> 14:17.857
Sandra, block her
with your body!

14:17.900 --> 14:20.250
- Sandra, subdue him.
- No! Ah--

14:22.122 --> 14:23.863
- Sandra, what are you doing?
- I'm sick of you two.

14:23.906 --> 14:25.647
Figure it out.

14:25.690 --> 14:27.692
I don't need the stress.

14:27.736 --> 14:29.390
A chunk of my hair fell out,

14:29.433 --> 14:32.219
and I will not be bald
for my wedding!

14:36.745 --> 14:38.529
- All right, all right.

14:38.573 --> 14:40.357
Wings are on the way.

14:40.401 --> 14:44.100
I got tokens for skee-ball
and I got a table keg.

14:44.144 --> 14:45.841
- Dude, you know we have to
go back to work.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.669
- Who cares? Who cares?
Don't worry about it.

14:47.712 --> 14:48.670
This is our bro time.

14:48.713 --> 14:50.280
This is our brocade.

14:50.324 --> 14:52.630
Well, that's a--that's a type
of embroidery, but you get it.

14:52.674 --> 14:54.415
- hey, look, man, you don't
have to prove anything.

14:54.458 --> 14:55.851
It's just, you're in
a different phase

14:55.895 --> 14:57.026
in your life right now,
and that's okay.

14:57.070 --> 14:58.680
- Oh, look who it is.

14:58.723 --> 15:00.464
Hey, Randy.
- Hey.

15:00.508 --> 15:01.901
- Randy, what are you
doing here?

15:01.944 --> 15:03.076
- Joseph DM'd me.

15:03.119 --> 15:04.555
- Joseph.
- Jonah.

15:04.599 --> 15:06.775
- Uh, he said Garrett
really needs you right now.

15:06.818 --> 15:09.734
- Yeah, needs you
to hang with us, uh,

15:09.778 --> 15:11.649
because it's guys' night,
you know?

15:11.693 --> 15:12.955
Guys'--well, it's lunch, so--

15:12.999 --> 15:14.783
Guys'--guys' lunch.

15:14.826 --> 15:16.524
- Dude.

15:17.438 --> 15:19.962
- Not gonna lie, it's getting
hard to hype you up in there.

15:20.006 --> 15:21.442
Not 'cause I don't think
you deserve it,

15:21.485 --> 15:23.139
just 'cause
you're doing so bad.

15:23.183 --> 15:25.054
- I didn't think Marcus
would be good.

15:25.098 --> 15:26.229
- Well, neither did I.

15:26.273 --> 15:28.884
What, did he take
the "Limitless" pill?

15:28.928 --> 15:29.972
You know, the movie "Limitless"

15:30.016 --> 15:31.147
where the guy takes the pill,
and--

15:31.191 --> 15:32.409
- This isn't the time, Amy.

15:32.453 --> 15:33.584
- Okay.

15:33.628 --> 15:35.543
- You have to fix this. Now.

15:35.586 --> 15:37.371
- I know. Okay--

15:37.414 --> 15:39.677
maybe I can ask everybody
to do things

15:39.721 --> 15:41.114
that only you're good at.

15:41.157 --> 15:42.985
- Okay.
- Mm, oh, yeah.

15:43.029 --> 15:45.596
Like kissing your brother.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.947
- I'm not ruling it out.

15:47.990 --> 15:52.516
- I see you took the initiative
to make my favorite meal.

15:52.560 --> 15:55.171
Um--
Oh, mushrooms.

15:55.215 --> 15:57.130
- Wait, aren't you allergic
to mushrooms?

15:57.173 --> 16:00.046
- You are?
- No--no--

16:00.089 --> 16:02.178
I love them.

16:02.222 --> 16:04.354
Can you go get my EpiPen?

16:04.398 --> 16:08.489
- âª There were nights
where the wind was so cold âª

16:08.532 --> 16:10.665
- You really need your
assistant o sing to you?

16:10.708 --> 16:13.189
- It helps with stress.
You should've known that.

16:13.233 --> 16:15.017
Ten points deducted.
- No

16:15.061 --> 16:17.889
- âª Right outside the window

16:17.933 --> 16:22.242
- âª To dance with
my father again âª

16:22.285 --> 16:25.419
- Oh.
- My gosh.

16:27.638 --> 16:29.510
Wow.

16:29.553 --> 16:32.034
A swing and a miss.

16:35.385 --> 16:38.519
- There she is.
There's our girl.

16:38.562 --> 16:40.521
- Have you guys
worked things out?

16:40.564 --> 16:42.871
- We have, and we want
to apologize.

16:42.914 --> 16:45.134
We were acting like such fools.

16:45.178 --> 16:48.311
- Okay. So who do I listen to
about the display?

16:48.355 --> 16:49.921
both: Me.

16:49.965 --> 16:52.315
- Dina, we agreed
it would be me.

16:52.359 --> 16:54.013
- No, we agreed it would be me

16:54.056 --> 16:55.318
because I knew
she would never believe

16:55.362 --> 16:56.928
that I would let you
be in charge.

16:56.972 --> 16:59.061
- Let--I am in charge.

16:59.105 --> 17:00.323
- You?
- Yes.

17:00.367 --> 17:02.064
- You have diabetes.
You aren't even in control

17:02.108 --> 17:04.675
of your own glucose.

17:04.719 --> 17:06.590
- When you're done
typing up the memo,

17:06.634 --> 17:08.984
print it out, and then run it
back here to me.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.681
- Done.
- Yes.

17:12.509 --> 17:15.077
- What the hell? You said
you typed 100 words a minute.

17:15.121 --> 17:16.774
- I liked, okay?
Everyone says that.

17:22.128 --> 17:25.218
Ah, where's the printer?
Who moved the printer?

17:25.261 --> 17:26.697
Sayid, where's the printer?

17:26.741 --> 17:28.960
- I won't tell you.
I have an alliance with Justine

17:29.004 --> 17:30.223
- How does that even work?

17:30.266 --> 17:33.661
- Coming through!
- No!

17:33.704 --> 17:36.098
- I did it, I did it. Ah.

17:36.142 --> 17:37.969
Whoo! I got the job.
- Whoo!

17:38.013 --> 17:39.145
- I won, I won.
Victory lap.

17:39.188 --> 17:40.537
Guys, carry me out.
Come on, let's go.

17:40.581 --> 17:43.279
- There's a lot to consider--
- Whoo! Yeah!

17:43.323 --> 17:46.326
Marcus! Marcus!
- Still have to assess the--

17:46.369 --> 17:47.849
- I know it wasn't the plan,

17:47.892 --> 17:49.720
but I think you'll be
really happy with him.

17:53.985 --> 17:56.292
- I can't give you
this position.

17:56.336 --> 17:58.729
- What?
I crushed the interview.

17:58.773 --> 18:00.340
- Yeah, no, I know.

18:00.383 --> 18:01.428
Part of me was like,
what are you,

18:01.471 --> 18:03.125
taking the "Limitless" pill?

18:03.169 --> 18:04.518
- Amy, no one saw that movie.

18:04.561 --> 18:05.997
- Yeah, but you know
the premise,

18:06.041 --> 18:08.130
so the joke is good,
it works.

18:08.174 --> 18:11.133
Anyway, I need to
give this to Mateo.

18:11.177 --> 18:14.136
- Oh! Of course you were gonna
pick one of your favorites.

18:14.180 --> 18:16.138
This whole interview process
was a fake.

18:16.182 --> 18:19.576
- No--I mean, yes, but not for
the reasons you think.

18:21.187 --> 18:24.059
Look, Mateo never got
a work permit.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.800
I convinced Dan
to keep him on the books

18:25.843 --> 18:27.106
and let him work for me.

18:27.149 --> 18:29.282
You know how miserable
he's been in that job.

18:29.325 --> 18:31.414
So please don't tell HR.

18:31.458 --> 18:33.199
- Oh, man.

18:33.242 --> 18:35.636
I--I totally get it.

18:35.679 --> 18:38.160
He--of course he should
get the job.

18:38.204 --> 18:40.554
- Right? Thank you
for understanding.

18:40.597 --> 18:43.078
No problem.
I' just take the pay raise

18:43.122 --> 18:44.471
and then we're good.

18:44.514 --> 18:47.604
- I'm sorry, wh--what?
No.

18:47.648 --> 18:50.085
- Well, I mean,
I did still win.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.521
And it just seems like
if you want me

18:51.565 --> 18:52.957
to keep quiet about all this,

18:53.001 --> 18:55.438
you should make it
worth my while. Right?

18:57.701 --> 19:01.009
Okay, well, how about
weekends off?

19:01.052 --> 19:04.273
- Oh, man, that's
such a good start.

19:04.317 --> 19:05.840
- Okay, Marcus,
just tell me what you want.

19:05.883 --> 19:10.192
- Amy, I--I think we both know
what I want.

19:10.236 --> 19:13.021
Mm.

19:13.064 --> 19:18.026
And I've been wanting it
for a very long time.

19:20.159 --> 19:23.074
- Hey, Rico, check it out.
I got a desk.

19:24.641 --> 19:27.427
Whoo!

19:27.470 --> 19:29.864
- So you're telling me
there was a second encore?

19:29.907 --> 19:32.997
- What? That's crazy.
What song was it?

19:33.041 --> 19:36.262
- I, um, don't know
what it's called.

19:36.305 --> 19:38.046
Anyways, Jake was going nuts

19:38.089 --> 19:39.526
and Margo wanted
to leave early.

19:39.569 --> 19:41.136
- Oh, uh, Margo.
You told me about Margo.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.399
She's, uh, the, like,
super annoying one

19:43.443 --> 19:46.272
with the fish face.

19:46.315 --> 19:49.579
He does such a good--

19:49.623 --> 19:51.625
- Margo's my girlfriend.

19:51.668 --> 19:54.062
- Oh, that's--

19:54.105 --> 19:55.890
No, you never mentioned--
That's, yeah,

19:55.933 --> 19:58.371
I'm thinking of a different
Mar--we know so many.

19:58.414 --> 20:00.851
So, different Margo.

20:00.895 --> 20:03.289
- So you think my girlfriend's
annoying?

20:03.332 --> 20:05.116
- No, I just--

20:05.160 --> 20:07.031
- You know what?

20:07.075 --> 20:09.251
I didn't like Colleen,
but I kept that to myself

20:09.295 --> 20:12.211
and I definitely didn't talk
about her behind your back.

20:12.254 --> 20:14.256
Not cool, man.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.873
- He'll--he'll probably just
Venmo us for his--his portion.

20:22.917 --> 20:24.005
You know what? I'm gonna--
I'll get it.

20:24.048 --> 20:25.615
I should--I'm gonna get it.

20:28.183 --> 20:29.750
- So your new desk
is gonna be here in three days.

20:29.793 --> 20:31.273
- Oh, thank you.

20:31.317 --> 20:33.275
- Oh, and tomorrow
I was thinking of doing

20:33.319 --> 20:34.929
Mariah Carey's "Fantasy."

20:34.972 --> 20:36.844
And then on Tuesday,
maybe Patti LaBelle, or--

20:36.887 --> 20:38.976
- Oh, no Mateo,

20:39.020 --> 20:41.240
you don't actually
have to sing to me.

20:41.283 --> 20:43.024
- Oh.

20:43.067 --> 20:45.853
Uh, for sure. Yeah.
I mean, that--

20:45.896 --> 20:48.943
that makes the most sense.

20:53.513 --> 20:55.079
- She's not coming back, huh?

20:55.123 --> 20:56.777
- Nope, guess this is dinner.

20:58.126 --> 21:01.260
- Mm, mm.
Don't eat too much.

21:02.043 --> 21:04.175
I'll save that for later. Um--

21:06.700 --> 21:08.832
Do you mind if I play
a little harmonica?

21:08.876 --> 21:10.399
- No, do your thing.
- To practice? Yeah.

21:21.062 --> 21:23.107
- You're very talented.
- Thank you.
