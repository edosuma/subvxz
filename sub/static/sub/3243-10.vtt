00:00.001 --> 00:04.303
   Joshua: <i> In the beginning,</i>
    <i> a star fell from heaven</i>

00:04.305 --> 00:06.105
        <i> And changed us.</i>

00:06.107 --> 00:09.308
         <i> Made us angels</i>
   <i> and gave us a new destiny:</i>

00:09.310 --> 00:12.511
     <i> To stop the apocalypse</i>

00:12.513 --> 00:15.481
     <i> And the devil himself.</i>

00:15.483 --> 00:17.282
    <i> We must pass god's test</i>

00:17.284 --> 00:21.420
       <i> And prove humanity</i>
     <i> is still worth saving.</i>

00:21.422 --> 00:23.555
   <i> For we are the messengers.</i>

00:27.695 --> 00:29.628
             Erin:
<i>Previously on</i> the messengers...

00:29.629 --> 00:31.562
             Eliza:
  Your daughter's been touched
    with a gift of her own.

00:31.565 --> 00:32.564
              Amy:
        <i> Together again,</i>

00:32.566 --> 00:34.099
     Just like my drawing.

00:34.101 --> 00:36.468
              Is this all of us?
                     Who's that?

00:36.470 --> 00:38.704
   That's my friend michael.

00:38.706 --> 00:40.572
He likes soccer.

00:40.574 --> 00:42.041
            You promised me if i
       listened to your stories,

00:42.043 --> 00:43.642
            I'd get my son back.
           Now where is michael?

00:43.644 --> 00:45.544
          What the hell is this?

00:45.546 --> 00:47.246
The man:
St. Monica.

00:47.248 --> 00:48.781
  The patron saint of mothers.

00:48.783 --> 00:50.716
      I saw these two boys
         in my vision.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.651
Vera:
I've seen them
twice today, too.

00:52.653 --> 00:53.652
It's definitely a sign.

00:53.653 --> 00:54.652
                  These brothers
               must be connected

00:54.655 --> 00:56.071
           To the next horseman.

00:56.072 --> 00:57.488
   How is rose any different
      from the rest of us?

00:57.491 --> 00:58.490
The man:
Because

00:58.492 --> 01:01.693
 Rose is the horseman of death.

01:01.695 --> 01:03.362
     Rest in peace, joshua.

01:09.804 --> 01:12.171
            (gasps)

01:13.674 --> 01:15.174
 We can't save him, he's dead.

01:15.176 --> 01:16.809
          He doesn't have to be.
What do you mean?

01:16.811 --> 01:18.127
       What if i told you

01:18.128 --> 01:19.444
                 I can bring him
             back from the dead?

01:19.447 --> 01:20.813
             That if you give me
                    what i want,

01:20.815 --> 01:22.481
  I'll resurrect your friend?

01:23.451 --> 01:25.317
The man:
All right, dear messengers,

01:25.319 --> 01:28.787
Take a moment
and ask yourselves:

01:28.789 --> 01:31.090
           What would joshua do?

01:31.092 --> 01:32.424
      He would do anything
       to save one of us.

01:32.426 --> 01:33.859
Except for make a deal
with the devil.

01:33.861 --> 01:37.496
         But eliza said we can't
             defeat the horsemen

01:37.498 --> 01:40.132
     Unless all seven messengers
               are truly united.

01:40.134 --> 01:41.633
     We can't defeat anyone
        without joshua.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.202
         No, you can't.

01:44.305 --> 01:46.255
   You need a man of vision,

01:46.256 --> 01:48.206
 Which means you need to share
   his latest vision with me,

01:48.209 --> 01:51.510
Or... I will leave him for dead.

01:54.215 --> 01:56.648
    And you can all go back
to the bar and cry in your beer.

01:56.650 --> 01:57.883
      If you want to know
     what his visions are,

01:57.885 --> 01:59.852
    Then you need him alive
     just as much as we do.

01:59.854 --> 02:01.420
     Do i?

02:02.690 --> 02:05.157
         I'll give you
     till the count of ten.

02:05.159 --> 02:06.291
             One...

02:06.293 --> 02:07.559
                 It's a mistake.
            Don't listen to him.

02:07.561 --> 02:09.127
Two...
    What choice do we have?

02:09.130 --> 02:11.130
Three...
           How do we know
       this isn't just a lie?

02:11.132 --> 02:12.131
Four...
             We don't.

02:12.133 --> 02:13.432
            Five...
    We want the same thing.

02:13.434 --> 02:14.633
Yeah, but for different reasons.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.535
        Six... Seven...

02:16.537 --> 02:18.270
 Guys, we don't have a choice.
                        Eight...

02:18.272 --> 02:19.805
We're just gonna give the devil
         what he wants?
                       Nine...

02:19.807 --> 02:20.873
            Vera: Joshua will be
                damned if we do,

02:20.875 --> 02:22.441
But we'll all be damned
if we don't.

02:22.443 --> 02:24.376
Ten-- now tell me
what i want to hear

02:24.378 --> 02:25.711
And don't lie to me,

02:25.713 --> 02:27.746
 Or there will be hell to pay.

02:30.284 --> 02:31.884
                         Plowman
                   family farms.
Damn it, vera!

02:31.886 --> 02:33.385
          That's what joshua saw
             in his last vision.

02:33.387 --> 02:35.454
           The logo with a photo
            of the two brothers,

02:35.456 --> 02:36.455
       Mark and vincent--

02:36.457 --> 02:37.456
     They own the company.

02:37.457 --> 02:38.456
        The headquarters
       is in california.

02:38.459 --> 02:40.392
      That's what we know.

02:40.394 --> 02:42.895
      Farming and famine.

02:42.897 --> 02:44.830
  Sounds like a perfect match.

02:44.832 --> 02:46.565
 Okay, you got what you wanted.
     Now bring joshua back.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.167
      Don't rush me, boy.

02:57.278 --> 02:59.912
        (eerie chanting)

03:10.224 --> 03:11.356
        (stops chanting)

03:27.274 --> 03:28.907
Vera:
Joshua.

03:30.978 --> 03:33.212
           (gasping)

03:43.991 --> 03:45.924
      What have you done?

03:52.866 --> 03:55.467
      So the devil really
    brought me back to life?

03:55.469 --> 03:56.468
Vera:
Yeah.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.737
  And rose really killed you?

03:58.739 --> 04:01.006
  She's the horseman of death.

04:01.008 --> 04:03.275
                Look, you didn't
               tell her anything

04:03.277 --> 04:04.309
                      About your
                 visions, right?

04:04.311 --> 04:06.345
               Not about plowman
                     farms or...

04:06.347 --> 04:08.013
              No.

04:10.284 --> 04:11.283
                         I lied.

04:11.285 --> 04:12.618
                    No one knows

04:12.620 --> 04:14.253
 About the real vision but us.

04:14.255 --> 04:15.621
                  And the devil.

04:15.623 --> 04:17.522
Erin:
But at least

04:17.524 --> 04:18.857
      We've got you back.

04:20.827 --> 04:21.827
Peter:
But... H-how do we know

04:21.829 --> 04:23.462
What our next move is?

04:23.464 --> 04:25.430
                         Joshua:
              I know what to do.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.869
  And as long as i'm alive...

04:33.274 --> 04:36.408
   ...I will not let us fail.

04:38.312 --> 04:40.045
      (train horn blaring)

04:43.050 --> 04:44.533
            Joshua:
    I did a little research.

04:44.534 --> 04:46.017
    The plowmans are holding
   a public press conference

04:46.020 --> 04:47.386
     The day after tomorrow

04:47.388 --> 04:48.654
And we gotta get there.

04:48.656 --> 04:49.655
                  So we're gonna
                       train hop

04:49.657 --> 04:51.023
                  All the way to
                     california?

04:52.026 --> 04:53.925
        Tickets, please.

04:56.497 --> 04:59.364
     Just messing with you.

05:02.036 --> 05:04.036
 You're like a michael jackson
     video, you know that?

05:05.939 --> 05:07.806
                    So we're not
               sitting together?

05:07.808 --> 05:09.558
          You're lucky
     you got seats at all.

05:09.559 --> 05:11.309
 It's not easy hustling tickets
     for wanted fugitives.

05:12.379 --> 05:14.446
All aboard.

05:17.584 --> 05:19.651
          Cindy: I have no doubt
                   once you have

05:19.653 --> 05:21.453
                 A full grasp of
              operation genesis,

05:21.455 --> 05:23.989
                 You'll see that
             your hacking skills

05:23.991 --> 05:25.791
        Will come in very handy.

05:25.793 --> 05:27.959
     You're sure the devil

05:27.961 --> 05:29.594
   Won't find out about this?

05:29.596 --> 05:31.330
                   How would he?

05:31.332 --> 05:33.732
He seems
to have his ways.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.918
Let's face it:

05:35.919 --> 05:38.103
Horsemen have worked with him
for six generations.

05:38.105 --> 05:41.073
   He's always been able to talk
     them out of the apocalypse.

05:41.075 --> 05:42.841
         Not this time.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.676
He just wants to hold
onto his playground.

05:44.678 --> 05:47.112
We have a purpose.

05:47.114 --> 05:49.448
      (train horn blares)

05:52.686 --> 05:54.553
We stop in
albuquerque next,

05:54.555 --> 05:55.687
Then on to california.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.456
Should put us right
in time for the event

05:57.458 --> 05:59.925
Tomorrow at
plowman headquarters.

05:59.927 --> 06:01.760
And get this:

06:01.762 --> 06:03.128
These brothers,
mark and vincent,

06:03.130 --> 06:04.930
They're not just farmers.

06:04.932 --> 06:06.765
They're big players

06:06.767 --> 06:08.867
In the genetically
modified seed industry.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.669
Supposed to announce
some new technology

06:10.671 --> 06:12.504
That's been kept
under wraps.

06:12.506 --> 06:13.605
I wonder if that
has anything to do

06:13.607 --> 06:14.606
With breaking the next
horseman's seal.

06:14.608 --> 06:18.110
                Maybe... But let
                me ask you this:

06:19.513 --> 06:21.613
               What was it like?

06:21.615 --> 06:22.714
      What was what like?

06:22.716 --> 06:24.149
                     To be dead.

06:24.151 --> 06:26.017
                  In my culture,

06:26.019 --> 06:27.619
                   We believe in
                  reincarnation.

06:27.621 --> 06:30.122
                Just not the way
                     you did it.

06:30.124 --> 06:33.024
                 So i'm curious.

06:33.026 --> 06:34.493
                 Do you remember
                       anything?

06:38.065 --> 06:40.132
I saw a tunnel of light.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.003
   You know, the one everyone
      always talks about?

06:47.174 --> 06:49.775
    And i was headed
  right toward heaven.

06:53.414 --> 06:55.814
      And then, suddenly,
    i felt an ice-cold hand

06:55.816 --> 06:58.150
    On the back of my neck,

06:58.152 --> 06:59.684
        Yanking me back.

07:02.156 --> 07:04.456
    And it still feels like

07:04.458 --> 07:06.525
       The devil's got me
       tight in his grip.

07:09.062 --> 07:10.762
        I know why y'all
        brought me back.

07:12.533 --> 07:15.100
But what if i go to hell for it?

07:23.010 --> 07:25.444
                    Pick a card.

07:27.181 --> 07:28.213
                      Come on...

07:28.215 --> 07:29.448
                     This is the
                first card trick

07:29.450 --> 07:30.649
       My father ever taught me.

07:30.651 --> 07:32.584
        Learned it when
       i was, like, six.

07:33.887 --> 07:35.554
 It's called "dead man's hand."

07:35.556 --> 07:38.089
                  Just pick one,
                      all right?

07:38.091 --> 07:40.625
And memorize it and put it back.

07:52.105 --> 07:54.739
      And your card is...

07:54.741 --> 07:57.209
                       Not here.

07:57.211 --> 07:58.510
               You don't see it,
                         do you?

07:58.512 --> 07:59.611
 Mm-mm.

07:59.613 --> 08:01.646
                   That's weird.

08:01.648 --> 08:02.981
              Check your pocket.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.583
Come on...

08:05.652 --> 08:07.052
                     Your card?

08:11.024 --> 08:13.024
It's still
a good trick, though.

08:13.026 --> 08:16.261
             Wait, that never...

08:16.263 --> 08:17.262
             That never happens.

08:17.264 --> 08:19.264
    It's okay.
                   No, it's not.

08:19.266 --> 08:21.700
     I know this trick like
      the back of my hand.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.536
What the hell is wrong with me?

08:24.538 --> 08:26.037
            I, uh...

08:26.039 --> 08:27.506
      It's getting worse.

08:27.508 --> 08:28.507
            What is?

08:30.544 --> 08:31.910
Um, i've been forgetting things.

08:31.912 --> 08:33.945
       Like, things that
    i've known all my life.

08:33.947 --> 08:37.616
           It just...
  It started not too long ago.

08:37.618 --> 08:38.750
    After you got your gift?

08:40.554 --> 08:42.520
     You just shape-shifted
  at the train station, right?

08:42.523 --> 08:44.222
           Yeah. So?

08:44.224 --> 08:46.258
   Maybe the memory problems

08:46.260 --> 08:49.528
   Are the cost of your gift.

08:49.530 --> 08:51.162
            (sighs)

09:07.247 --> 09:09.080
            (gasps)

09:11.318 --> 09:12.951
You had a vision.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.953
What was it?

09:14.955 --> 09:17.022
    There's a storm coming.

09:23.697 --> 09:26.264
                           Vera:
        I'm telling you, amy has
              some kind of gift.

09:26.266 --> 09:27.699
    See? Rose isn't in this.

09:27.701 --> 09:29.834
        Somehow amy knew
    she wasn't a messenger.

09:29.836 --> 09:31.102
  You just said she also drew

09:31.104 --> 09:32.337
 The devil at the last supper.

09:32.339 --> 09:34.239
I mean, what are
you feeding this kid?

09:34.241 --> 09:35.240
                      And this--

09:35.242 --> 09:37.175
      Michael's soccer uniform--

09:37.177 --> 09:38.443
               It's the same one

09:38.444 --> 09:39.710
              I saw in the video
            the devil showed me.

09:39.713 --> 09:41.212
             And the "m"...

09:41.214 --> 09:42.681
        It could be for michael.

09:42.683 --> 09:44.115
       Did you ever show
       the video to amy?

09:44.117 --> 09:45.350
                      No.

09:45.352 --> 09:47.352
             She says it's
         her imaginary friend.

09:47.354 --> 09:49.654
                 I mean, somehow
                   she has to be

09:49.656 --> 09:50.956
Connected to all of this, right?

09:52.192 --> 09:54.359
Are you sure
she's not a messenger?

09:54.361 --> 09:57.295
          I mean, if she is,
      we haven't seen her wings.

09:58.699 --> 10:01.066
   Well, the bible's
  full of characters.

10:01.068 --> 10:03.902
     Maybe amy's got
a different role to play.

10:07.674 --> 10:09.641
              How are you doing?

10:09.643 --> 10:12.344
      Honestly, not great.

10:12.346 --> 10:15.013
        I gotta get amy
      away from all this.

10:15.015 --> 10:17.115
           You know?
        Rose, the devil,

10:17.117 --> 10:18.650
The things
that she's seen...

10:18.652 --> 10:20.018
 And now she's drawing pictures

10:20.020 --> 10:21.353
That seem to predict the future.

10:21.355 --> 10:23.021
   I mean, i'm really worried
           about her.

10:23.023 --> 10:24.789
   Sucks to be a parent, huh?

10:24.791 --> 10:26.758
      Sometimes.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.228
        You ever thought
        about being one?

10:33.767 --> 10:35.800
                   I am.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.636
           (laughs):
             What?

10:37.638 --> 10:38.903
       What do you mean?

10:41.675 --> 10:43.742
             Gabriela told me...

10:45.946 --> 10:48.179
     ...That i'm nadia's father.

10:50.751 --> 10:52.717
     Conductor (over p.A.):
     Attention, passengers.

10:52.719 --> 10:54.786
 Our next stop is albuquerque.

11:00.193 --> 11:01.192
          V, wait up!

11:01.194 --> 11:03.428
   Uh, excuse me, sorry, sorry.

11:05.899 --> 11:07.999
          V, what are you doing?
         It's just a quick stop.

11:09.302 --> 11:13.171
          Oh, my god.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.439
No way.

11:14.441 --> 11:16.441
          St. Monica,
    patron saint of mothers.

11:16.443 --> 11:19.310
          Want to buy a cupcake?

11:19.312 --> 11:21.680
         We're raising money for
      our school soccer program.

11:23.450 --> 11:24.683
                     Mi-michael?

11:24.685 --> 11:27.419
                  Mi... Michael.

11:27.421 --> 11:29.454
Oh, um...

11:29.456 --> 11:31.456
Uh, yeah, chocolate,
uh, please?

11:39.066 --> 11:40.165
     Do you know this boy?

11:40.167 --> 11:41.166
             Guys!

11:41.168 --> 11:42.217
                 Brian fairburn.

11:42.218 --> 11:43.267
             Yeah, i babysit for
               him all the time.

11:43.270 --> 11:44.269
Guys, the train's
about to leave!

11:44.271 --> 11:46.104
  Can i borrow this a second?

11:46.106 --> 11:47.172
                     Sure.

11:47.174 --> 11:49.708
 I think i just found michael.

11:49.710 --> 11:51.843
What are you talking about?
           Look at number three.

11:53.313 --> 11:54.713
              That boy's my son.

11:54.715 --> 11:56.448
                That-that-that's
                    the same boy

11:56.450 --> 11:58.183
          From the videos i saw.

11:58.185 --> 11:59.484
And the same boy
from amy's drawings.

11:59.486 --> 12:01.853
        And-and look...

12:01.855 --> 12:03.455
The medallion the devil gave me.

12:03.457 --> 12:04.889
          St. Monica.

12:04.891 --> 12:07.192
              It's the same name
                 as this school.

12:07.194 --> 12:08.644
               Look, we gave him
                 what he wanted,

12:08.645 --> 12:10.095
         And i think the devil's
 given me a clue to find my son.

12:10.097 --> 12:11.930
Or it could be just
another one of his tricks.

12:11.932 --> 12:14.232
           But what if it isn't?

12:16.503 --> 12:19.070
           I can't leave without
               knowing for sure.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.189
We can't give up on the mission.

12:21.190 --> 12:23.307
It's not safe for any of us
to be alone right now.

12:23.310 --> 12:24.909
                She's not alone.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.945
               I'm staying, too.
Vera, look at me.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.515
      I know how important
        this is to you.

12:33.487 --> 12:35.487
But you cannot leave.

12:35.489 --> 12:38.156
                    It's my son.

12:38.158 --> 12:39.290
         (p.A. Chiming)

12:39.292 --> 12:41.392
           Conductor:
   Attention, all passengers.

12:41.394 --> 12:45.263
This is the final boarding call
    for the westbound train.

12:50.003 --> 12:53.271
     You need to tell nadia
    as soon as we get back.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.939
                         I know.

12:54.941 --> 12:56.808
           She already blames me
             for losing her dad.

12:56.810 --> 12:58.243
        It's like, if i tell her
            this, then it's like

12:58.245 --> 13:00.111
        I'm taking him away from
             her all over again.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.479
     No, you're not taking
    anything away from her.

13:01.481 --> 13:02.947
     You're just giving her
           the truth.

13:04.885 --> 13:07.252
      Why did you tell me?

13:07.254 --> 13:09.387
         Because the last time i
         wasn't honest with you,

13:09.389 --> 13:11.890
              I almost lost you.

13:13.226 --> 13:15.894
           And i don't want that
           to happen ever again.

13:17.197 --> 13:19.964
   Do you still have feelings
         for gabriela?

13:21.468 --> 13:22.834
                   Nah.

13:24.204 --> 13:26.237
        I have feelings for you.

13:47.861 --> 13:49.227
              Man:
        <i> Son of a bitch!</i>

13:49.229 --> 13:52.997
     <i> That's that kid wanted</i>
          <i> for murder.</i>

14:03.009 --> 14:04.442
                      (quietly):
                        Peter...

14:04.444 --> 14:05.610
                 Peter, wake up.

14:05.612 --> 14:06.911
               You've been made.

14:06.913 --> 14:08.947
            Keep him here, okay?
           Erin: Yeah.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.116
   Come on! Answer the phone.

14:12.118 --> 14:13.585
  Woman: Police headquarters.
  How may i direct your call?

14:13.587 --> 14:14.936
              Hey!

14:14.937 --> 14:16.286
     This is deputy landis
       out of flagstaff.

14:16.289 --> 14:17.622
      Look, i'm off-duty,
   but i need to report a...

14:17.624 --> 14:19.924
           (grunting)

14:24.931 --> 14:25.997
              Sir?

14:25.999 --> 14:27.298
      Sir, are you there?

14:27.300 --> 14:29.033
       (phone beeps off)

14:34.875 --> 14:35.907
       (train horn blows)

14:44.551 --> 14:47.085
        I can't take you
        anywhere, can i?

14:47.087 --> 14:49.888
          We gotta go.

14:55.295 --> 14:56.527
        What's going on?

14:56.529 --> 14:58.062
Josh just had a vision.

14:58.064 --> 15:00.164
            I saw a tree
      with a blue tire swing.

15:00.166 --> 15:02.567
And then rain started to fall--

15:02.569 --> 15:05.370
 Red rain-- and-and everything
      just turned to dust.

15:05.372 --> 15:07.005
      The next seal maybe?

15:07.006 --> 15:08.639
         Well, i hate to say it,
      but we got other problems.

15:08.642 --> 15:09.941
          Cop just i.D.'d peter.

15:09.943 --> 15:11.276
     We gotta get off the train.

15:11.278 --> 15:12.977
       But we need to get
    to the plowman brothers.

15:12.979 --> 15:15.213
             Change of plans.
   No. Listen to me.

15:15.215 --> 15:16.347
 We already lost vera and alan.

15:16.349 --> 15:17.982
      The rest of us have
       to stay on point.

15:17.984 --> 15:19.567
   We can't do that behind bars.

15:19.568 --> 15:21.151
        Peter's not the only one
          who's a fugitive here.

15:21.154 --> 15:22.220
      Erin's wanted, i'm wanted.

15:22.222 --> 15:23.988
What do we do?

15:23.990 --> 15:26.958
                  Koa, cover me.

15:30.063 --> 15:32.297
         (alarm rings)

15:32.299 --> 15:34.565
 Everything's all right, folks.

15:34.567 --> 15:37.135
Just a quick maintenance check.

15:37.137 --> 15:39.203
    We'll be back on our way
          in a jiffy.

15:48.481 --> 15:49.981
  (echoing, indistinct voice;
       becoming clearer)

15:49.983 --> 15:51.582
            Joshua:
 ...No, guys, we can't do this.

15:51.584 --> 15:53.484
     We can figure it out,
 but we got to stick together!

15:53.486 --> 15:54.552
       Then we're screwed, josh!

15:54.554 --> 15:55.837
        If we stay on the train,

15:55.838 --> 15:57.121
The entire mission
gets derailed.

15:57.123 --> 15:59.157
You okay?
                 Yeah. I'm good.

15:59.159 --> 16:00.325
          Erin: Look, we'll meet
            you at the plowmans.

16:00.327 --> 16:03.161
                  Okay? Promise.

16:03.163 --> 16:05.196
       (door hisses open)

16:18.411 --> 16:21.479
Who knew this trip could
actually get longer?

16:21.481 --> 16:23.114
  I think the correct response
          to somebody

16:23.116 --> 16:24.549
Who saved your ass is thank you.

16:24.551 --> 16:25.717
         Would you guys stop it?

16:25.719 --> 16:27.151
      At least, we found a road.

16:27.153 --> 16:28.486
                It's got to lead
               somewhere, right?

16:28.488 --> 16:30.221
  Hopefully to the next town.

16:30.223 --> 16:31.723
 We can catch a bus from there.

16:31.725 --> 16:33.524
Yeah, according to my gps,

16:33.526 --> 16:36.661
That's just
a short 47-mile walk.

16:36.663 --> 16:40.431
 Can you look up some good news
     on that thing, please?

16:40.433 --> 16:42.633
                What about that?

16:42.635 --> 16:44.535
                           Raul:
           Welcome to farmville.

16:48.541 --> 16:50.608
   (various animals bleating
    and mooing in distance)

16:56.449 --> 16:58.516
             Erin:
  It's dry as a bone out here.

16:58.518 --> 17:01.519
This place has seen better days.

17:02.589 --> 17:05.556
   (calf bellows in distance)

17:06.526 --> 17:08.593
Peter:
Hey, buddy.

17:16.469 --> 17:19.337
 Why you over here by yourself?

17:19.339 --> 17:21.672
Raul:
Peter...

17:28.748 --> 17:31.616
             Guys, check it out.

17:32.652 --> 17:34.685
                           Whoa.

17:34.687 --> 17:36.721
Do you think this is the tree
from joshua's vision?

17:39.059 --> 17:41.526
             Hey, use that phone
           of yours and ask him.

17:46.499 --> 17:49.233
 Maybe we can sweet-talk these
 people into giving us a ride?

17:49.235 --> 17:51.769
                           Erin:
                           Yeah.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.809
      Well, according to joshua,

17:57.811 --> 17:59.811
We're definitely here
for a reason.

17:59.813 --> 18:02.613
      Something we can do
         for you folks?

18:02.615 --> 18:05.483
       Look, i-i'm sorry.
  We don't mean to bother you.

18:05.485 --> 18:07.151
  We were actually just hoping
       you might be able

18:07.153 --> 18:08.386
  To give us a ride into town.

18:08.388 --> 18:10.588
    Yeah, our car broke down
       a few miles back.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.623
                 Earl cowan.
                             Hi.

18:12.625 --> 18:16.227
         Sorry to hear you folks
                   are stranded.

18:16.229 --> 18:17.829
 Tom's a pretty good mechanic.

18:17.831 --> 18:20.431
     Could, uh, tow you out
        and take a look.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.767
  Oh, thanks. It's pretty bad.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.135
Threw a rod, i think.
Engine's blown.

18:24.137 --> 18:25.336
                Really not worth
                the tow charges.

18:25.338 --> 18:26.771
Yeah, we just need a ride.

18:26.773 --> 18:29.340
Maybe to the nearest
bus station?

18:29.342 --> 18:32.710
    Well, i suppose we could
        give you a lift.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.178
           But it's an hour into
              town and it's, uh,

18:34.180 --> 18:36.714
          Just about suppertime.

18:36.716 --> 18:38.216
           Y'all must be hungry.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.784
                Care to join us?

18:40.620 --> 18:41.719
         (quiet laugh)

18:41.721 --> 18:43.254
Yeah.

18:43.256 --> 18:45.256
     Sure. We'd be honored.

18:45.258 --> 18:46.524
                     Come on in.

18:46.526 --> 18:48.659
            Thanks.

18:48.661 --> 18:49.794
Hey, v, shouldn't we, uh,

18:49.796 --> 18:50.828
At least think
this through a second?

18:50.830 --> 18:52.180
I mean, what are you gonna do?

18:52.181 --> 18:53.531
You just gonna walk in there
and take your kid back?

18:53.533 --> 18:55.800
              You're damn right!
Okay, but...

18:55.802 --> 18:57.568
  Well, shouldn't we at least
      call the cops first?

18:57.570 --> 18:58.636
           Or-or-or liam neeson?

18:58.638 --> 19:00.371
Look! I'm tired of waiting.

19:00.373 --> 19:01.806
         I want my son!

19:01.808 --> 19:03.474
(knocking on door)

19:04.444 --> 19:06.744
Answer the door!

19:06.746 --> 19:08.746
                  Hey, hey, hey!
                   Take it easy!

19:08.748 --> 19:10.148
    I don't think anyone's home.

19:11.251 --> 19:13.584
                             No.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.353
   No, come... No, come... Okay.

19:15.355 --> 19:16.721
            (grunts)

19:16.723 --> 19:18.222
           Ah, yeah.

19:18.224 --> 19:19.924
      Okay.

19:19.926 --> 19:21.792
 You're heavy when you're dead,
         you know that?

19:59.766 --> 20:01.832
             Vera!

20:06.406 --> 20:09.340
   Hey, i found a hide-a-key.

20:09.342 --> 20:11.943
                  Vera!

20:11.945 --> 20:14.712
   (alan grunts, vera gasps)

20:16.649 --> 20:18.316
              You're scaring me.

20:18.318 --> 20:20.851
I need to show you something.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.795
This was his room.

20:36.869 --> 20:39.837
Oh, vera, i'm...
I'm sorry.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.842
                   (quiet laugh)

20:48.414 --> 20:51.749
     It's a model
 of the solar system.

20:56.823 --> 20:58.623
       He got an a-plus.

21:06.666 --> 21:09.033
                           Alan:
                 I don't get it.

21:09.035 --> 21:10.701
      Why would they just
        leave like this?

21:12.338 --> 21:14.405
          (sniffling):
      I don't know, alan.

21:17.510 --> 21:19.343
             Vera:
             Wait.

21:21.814 --> 21:24.448
    Yes, i do.

21:31.291 --> 21:32.857
    (squeaks)

21:34.794 --> 21:36.527
        Son of a bitch.

21:37.930 --> 21:39.997
       Alan, he told them
        we were coming.

21:39.999 --> 21:42.433
The devil's
behind this.

21:42.435 --> 21:44.035
  That's why they're not here!

21:45.605 --> 21:47.305
                 Erin: And after
                 that adventure,

21:47.307 --> 21:48.739
          My first time riding a
         horse was also my last.

21:48.741 --> 21:50.474
      (everybody chuckles)

21:50.476 --> 21:52.943
 Well, i'm sorry we don't have
       more to offer you.

21:52.945 --> 21:54.745
       That was the last
        of the berries.

21:54.747 --> 21:57.348
   From our very last harvest
            at that.

21:57.350 --> 21:58.816
    Your very <i> last</i> harvest?

21:58.818 --> 22:01.319
       Well, it's been a bad few
      seasons across the valley.

22:01.321 --> 22:03.087
              Just can't seem to
              shake the drought.

22:03.089 --> 22:05.756
               Even with our own
              irrigation system,

22:05.758 --> 22:08.426
      We still haven't been able
          to turn things around.

22:08.428 --> 22:10.428
       Crops keep dying.

22:10.430 --> 22:11.896
 Afraid we've done all we can.

22:11.898 --> 22:14.031
             Well, we prayed and
           prayed for a miracle,

22:14.033 --> 22:16.033
And tom here finally
brought us one.

22:16.035 --> 22:17.735
                          Peter:
                         How so?

22:17.737 --> 22:20.638
          Well, he introduced us
             to those nice folks

22:20.640 --> 22:22.606
      From plowman family farms.

22:22.608 --> 22:24.842
                    They're, uh,
                  buying us out,

22:24.844 --> 22:28.412
Like they did every other
suffering farm in the valley.

22:28.414 --> 22:30.915
  Gladys: Well, we didn't know
     what we were gonna do.

22:30.917 --> 22:32.483
                We're always the
                   last holdout.

22:32.485 --> 22:33.884
                   Tom: Plowmans
               cover every base.

22:33.886 --> 22:38.122
 Soil treatment, improved seed,
          irrigation.

22:38.124 --> 22:39.890
       They're actually about to
  start testing their technology

22:39.892 --> 22:42.626
  On farms across the valley.

22:42.628 --> 22:43.828
              Once they do that,

22:43.830 --> 22:46.497
    They'll turn this place
       from a dirt patch

22:46.499 --> 22:47.965
Into a bumper crop, in no time.

22:47.967 --> 22:51.936
       All i got to do is
      sign the contracts,

22:51.938 --> 22:54.705
And then we'll be part
of the plowman family.

22:56.142 --> 22:57.641
     You'll have to excuse earl.

22:57.643 --> 23:00.578
                    Nerves a bit
                frazzled lately.

23:00.580 --> 23:01.846
           His great-grandfather
              started this farm,

23:01.848 --> 23:04.849
And it's hard for him
to let it go.

23:05.852 --> 23:08.886
              Tom:
   <i> But it's about damn time.</i>

23:18.598 --> 23:21.065
What about
your first job?

23:21.067 --> 23:22.767
                             No.

23:22.769 --> 23:24.435
Your first boyfriend?

23:25.738 --> 23:27.772
                    Nothing.
       Okay.

23:27.774 --> 23:29.974
What about the neighborhood
you grew up in?

23:29.976 --> 23:32.042
Do you remember
any of that?

23:35.882 --> 23:37.848
              Koa:
    <i> It used to be so clear.</i>

23:37.850 --> 23:38.983
       It was a good day.

23:38.985 --> 23:42.086
     <i> Now, for some reason,</i>
           <i> it just...</i>

23:42.088 --> 23:44.989
        <i> It's all a blur.</i>

23:46.926 --> 23:50.194
   Now i can't even remember
     my own father's face.

23:52.765 --> 23:54.732
    What's happening to me?

23:54.734 --> 23:58.936
       My opinion is that
  it has to do with your gift.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.805
Now, hear me out.

24:00.807 --> 24:03.174
You shape-shifted
at the train station,

24:03.176 --> 24:05.709
And then you forgot the trick
your father taught you.

24:05.711 --> 24:06.844
Then you morphed
into the conductor,

24:06.846 --> 24:08.446
And now these memories
are gone.

24:08.448 --> 24:10.981
                      So?

24:10.983 --> 24:13.117
        So...

24:13.119 --> 24:15.119
By stealing people's
identities,

24:15.121 --> 24:18.055
Maybe you're losing track
of your own.

24:20.026 --> 24:22.560
These gifts
we've been given,

24:22.562 --> 24:24.962
They weren't just
doled out at random.

24:26.866 --> 24:29.200
Each one of them
speaks to something

24:29.202 --> 24:31.869
That we need to learn
about ourselves.

24:31.871 --> 24:34.872
You were raised
a con artist, right?

24:34.874 --> 24:36.507
                   Yeah.

24:36.508 --> 24:38.141
So your whole past is
about manipulating folks.

24:39.879 --> 24:43.047
Then maybe your future
should be about helping them.

24:47.019 --> 24:49.019
            How do i know that's
                  gonna help me?

24:49.021 --> 24:51.088
Well, that's just it.

24:54.927 --> 24:56.994
Being a messenger
isn't about you.

24:59.932 --> 25:01.699
It's about everyone else.

25:06.072 --> 25:07.838
             Erin:
    "it's about damn time."

25:07.840 --> 25:09.840
       You're sure that's
  what you heard tom thinking?

25:09.842 --> 25:12.176
             Yeah, it was weird.

25:12.178 --> 25:14.278
         I don't know-- he seems
           like such a nice guy.

25:14.280 --> 25:16.514
      Maybe he's just frustrated
    over watching the farm fail.

25:16.516 --> 25:19.517
Joshua must have had a vision of
this place for a reason, right?

25:19.519 --> 25:21.519
I mean, it's about
to be taken over

25:21.521 --> 25:23.587
By the same brothers
we're looking at as horsemen.

25:23.589 --> 25:25.990
                        But why?

25:25.992 --> 25:27.691
I don't know.

25:27.693 --> 25:30.761
But we're supposed
to be here-- i'm sure of it.

25:34.166 --> 25:36.066
     (grunting, bellowing)

25:40.006 --> 25:41.872
Come on.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.874
Yeah, this way,
this way.

25:43.876 --> 25:45.109
    This way.

25:48.948 --> 25:50.681
       So why do you keep
    these two apart, anyway?

25:51.784 --> 25:53.551
'cause that one over there's
his mother,

25:53.553 --> 25:54.718
But this one,

25:54.720 --> 25:57.254
 He's gonna be a bull one day.

25:57.256 --> 25:59.323
         Might as well
     get used to it, right?

26:08.568 --> 26:10.034
                Earl: We'll need
                to hurry to town

26:10.036 --> 26:12.570
      If you want to catch
      the last night bus.

26:12.572 --> 26:14.572
            Or you're welcome to
         bunk in our guest room,

26:14.574 --> 26:16.073
               Get a fresh start
                 in the morning.

26:18.711 --> 26:20.778
 If it's not too much trouble,
       we'd love to stay.

26:20.780 --> 26:22.246
              No trouble.

26:22.248 --> 26:23.314
Thanks.

26:38.998 --> 26:40.998
             So this is what you
          were telling me about.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.001
The meteorite contains
every element known to man,

26:44.003 --> 26:46.036
Plus one we've never
seen before.

26:46.038 --> 26:48.138
               But every time we
              try to extract it,

26:48.140 --> 26:49.907
               Let's just say it
          becomes very volatile.

26:49.909 --> 26:54.044
 Well, in that case, my esteemed
   guest and i would like to see

26:54.046 --> 26:56.847
The extraction process
for ourselves.

26:56.849 --> 26:57.865
This evening.

26:57.866 --> 26:58.882
                Madam secretary,
           you don't understand.

26:58.884 --> 27:00.250
   I...

27:01.287 --> 27:03.020
...Think i understand perfectly.

27:03.022 --> 27:05.756
     I cannot continue to put my
 people in harm's way just so...

27:05.758 --> 27:06.924
Doctor...

27:06.926 --> 27:08.792
It's either your people...

27:09.695 --> 27:11.261
    ...Or you.

27:33.319 --> 27:35.386
                    Can't sleep?

27:38.024 --> 27:41.392
All my life,
i've been a preacher.

27:41.394 --> 27:43.827
But i was just selling
my old man's snake oil.

27:46.666 --> 27:48.999
        Then i met rose,

27:49.001 --> 27:52.236
   And finally thought i had
 something real to believe in.

27:52.238 --> 27:54.304
         She played you, joshua.

27:55.975 --> 27:57.975
         But you're not the only
            one who fell for it.

27:57.977 --> 27:58.976
Maybe not.

27:58.978 --> 28:02.046
But i used to lead people, koa.

28:02.048 --> 28:04.715
         Inspire them.

28:06.752 --> 28:09.753
   Now nobody listens to me.

28:09.755 --> 28:13.757
      I couldn't even keep
     six of us on a train.

28:15.061 --> 28:17.127
               Maybe you weren't
                    supposed to.

28:19.899 --> 28:23.767
                  There's an old
                 taoist saying--

28:23.769 --> 28:25.736
                  "when the best
          leader's work is done,

28:25.738 --> 28:27.905
                 The people say,
         'we did it ourselves.'"

28:31.010 --> 28:32.743
 You're a good leader, joshua.

28:35.848 --> 28:38.816
         You just need to listen
             to your own advice.

28:40.753 --> 28:42.486
       Yeah, what's that?

28:44.123 --> 28:46.457
             It's not about you.

28:46.459 --> 28:48.759
       It's about everyone else.

29:12.384 --> 29:14.852
              Tom:
   <i> Damn, this salt is heavy.</i>

29:16.789 --> 29:18.756
 <i> Plowman ain't paying me enough</i>
         <i> for this crap.</i>

29:34.006 --> 29:36.073
(indistinct radio communication)

29:40.813 --> 29:43.847
             Simon:
  Once the solution mixes with
  the pulverized meteor sample

29:43.849 --> 29:45.883
     Inside the centrifuge,

29:45.885 --> 29:49.319
The genesis element should be in
its purest form for collection.

29:49.321 --> 29:51.855
         But each time,
     it resists extraction,

29:51.857 --> 29:53.924
          Almost like
     it's defending itself.

29:56.862 --> 29:58.328
 I'm begging you to reconsider.

29:58.330 --> 30:01.298
                    Now, doctor.

30:02.802 --> 30:05.235
You heard the lady.

30:05.237 --> 30:07.304
Do as you're told.

30:12.878 --> 30:15.112
          Initialize.

30:15.114 --> 30:16.480
           Yes, sir.

30:21.053 --> 30:23.987
   Technicians (over radio):
           Initiated.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.867
      (technician screams)

30:43.409 --> 30:45.409
        Now do you see?

30:45.411 --> 30:48.912
     No matter what we try,
      it ends in disaster.

30:48.914 --> 30:50.247
             Wrong.

30:50.249 --> 30:51.615
        It's incredible.

30:51.617 --> 30:53.483
           Isn't it?

30:53.485 --> 30:55.619
          Oh, i think we're well
          on our way to creating

30:55.621 --> 30:59.223
     The most destructive weapon
       the world has ever known.

30:59.225 --> 31:02.392
Seven years of searching,
dead end after dead end,

31:02.394 --> 31:04.061
And now i've abandoned
everybody who needs me

31:04.063 --> 31:05.562
To go on
a wild goose chase.

31:05.564 --> 31:07.564
        No, it was a good lead--
           you had to follow it.

31:07.566 --> 31:10.234
The devil was never gonna
give me my son back, okay?

31:10.236 --> 31:12.302
How could i have
trusted him?

31:12.304 --> 31:14.338
        Vera, you are closer now
   than ever to finding michael.

31:14.340 --> 31:16.573
I need better
than "closer," alan.

31:19.345 --> 31:21.245
I need my son.

31:26.318 --> 31:27.317
    (tranquilizer gun fires)

31:27.319 --> 31:28.318
                (gasps):
                  Ow...

31:28.320 --> 31:29.653
    Alan?

31:29.655 --> 31:31.655
    Alan?! Alan?!

31:31.657 --> 31:33.090
            Alan...

31:33.092 --> 31:34.091
         Get off of me!

31:34.093 --> 31:35.092
Get off of me!

31:35.094 --> 31:36.560
        Get off of me...

31:38.030 --> 31:39.062
       What the hell did you do?

31:39.064 --> 31:40.430
         Nothing!
              Did you shoot her?

31:40.432 --> 31:42.566
        No.
          She pass out?

31:44.036 --> 31:45.669
      No, man, she's dead.

31:45.671 --> 31:47.037
      Are you kidding me?

31:47.039 --> 31:49.239
                We followed them
         all the way from texas.

31:49.241 --> 31:50.941
       Richards wants her alive.

31:50.943 --> 31:52.576
        (engine revving,
       tires screeching)

31:52.578 --> 31:55.145
       Just get them in the car.

31:55.147 --> 31:56.647
              Let's get the hell
                    out of here.

32:03.122 --> 32:04.554
        (engine revving,
       tires screeching)

32:11.997 --> 32:13.063
            (gasps)

32:18.370 --> 32:21.371
   (calf bleating, grunting)

32:21.373 --> 32:23.573
            (mooing)

32:30.015 --> 32:31.581
           Hey, bud.

32:31.583 --> 32:33.050
           (bellows)

32:33.052 --> 32:34.451
You're not gonna
give up, are you?

32:34.453 --> 32:36.219
           (bellows)

32:40.726 --> 32:42.993
       (bellows, grunts)

32:49.501 --> 32:51.969
               Let's go see mom.
     (calf bellowing)

32:52.671 --> 32:55.372
            (mooing)

32:57.209 --> 32:58.508
         (calf bleats)

33:09.755 --> 33:11.989
   Hope you have an appetite.

33:11.991 --> 33:14.458
     Gladys makes the best
     eggs and hash around.

33:14.460 --> 33:16.259
    (gladys laughs quietly)

33:16.261 --> 33:17.327
                  Thank you.

33:18.530 --> 33:20.764
 Morning, earl.
                    Morning.

33:20.766 --> 33:22.666
Mind tasting this?

33:24.136 --> 33:26.336
        It's water from
     your irrigation tank.

33:28.440 --> 33:29.506
                 (spits)

33:30.676 --> 33:32.042
          It's salty!

33:33.545 --> 33:36.046
  You want to tell him,
       or should i?

33:36.048 --> 33:37.047
         Tell me what?

33:37.049 --> 33:39.149
               Who the hell
            you think you are?

33:39.151 --> 33:41.284
I saw tom pouring salt
into the tank last night.

33:41.286 --> 33:42.652
      Don't listen to him, earl.

33:42.654 --> 33:44.154
 That would kill all the crops.

33:44.156 --> 33:46.123
Exactly.

33:46.125 --> 33:47.557
      Wh-why would you do
       a thing like that?

33:47.559 --> 33:49.059
                 I didn't.
He did.

33:49.060 --> 33:50.560
I'm guessing he's been
poisoning the water supply

33:50.562 --> 33:53.030
To make the farm fail,
so you'd be forced to sell.

33:58.637 --> 34:02.105
     You been like
   a son to me, tom.

34:02.107 --> 34:03.273
  You tell me the truth.

34:06.311 --> 34:08.578
                 (exhales)

34:10.149 --> 34:13.116
  Selling's for your own good,
and you know it, earl-- you do--

34:13.118 --> 34:15.118
  And you're so damn stubborn,

34:15.120 --> 34:16.353
       I was just trying
    to get you a fair price

34:16.355 --> 34:17.721
       Before you had to
      give the farm away.

34:17.722 --> 34:19.088
      How much of a price
you get from the plowman family

34:19.091 --> 34:20.157
     For selling them out?

34:23.094 --> 34:24.594
                  Gladys...

34:24.596 --> 34:26.263
Call the sheriff.

34:44.750 --> 34:47.451
  (door shuts, engine starts)

34:49.521 --> 34:52.222
     Peter, stop him!

34:59.531 --> 35:02.365
        (metal groaning,
      clanking, creaking)

35:22.354 --> 35:24.121
              Earl:
             <i> Well,</i>

35:24.123 --> 35:26.156
          I don't know how y'all
         did it, but you did it.

35:26.158 --> 35:28.558
                 Better head out
                   the back way.

35:28.560 --> 35:29.860
      You sure about this?

35:29.862 --> 35:31.261
                 Go on, take it.

35:31.263 --> 35:33.396
       It's the least we can do.
                Mm.

35:33.398 --> 35:34.698
       Don't worry, we'll
     bring your truck back

35:34.700 --> 35:36.233
        After we meet up
       with our friends.

35:36.235 --> 35:37.901
We aren't worried.

35:37.903 --> 35:41.371
I told you we prayed for a
miracle to save our farm and...

35:41.373 --> 35:45.275
Now we know-- you all
were the real miracle.

35:45.277 --> 35:48.778
       Earl: I just tore up that
     contract from the plowmans.

35:48.780 --> 35:50.313
                      Thank you.

36:01.860 --> 36:03.460
                You ready to get
                back on mission?

36:03.462 --> 36:05.662
  I think that <i> was</i>
    the mission.

36:10.302 --> 36:12.369
        (engine starts)

36:22.514 --> 36:24.581
      (lively, indistinct
         conversations)

36:40.199 --> 36:42.265
                  Don't worry,
                they'll be here.

36:52.945 --> 36:54.711
Hey, you made it.

36:54.712 --> 36:56.478
       Yeah-- 100 miles an hour,
          no patrolmen in sight.

36:56.481 --> 36:58.281
                 Thank god.

36:58.283 --> 36:59.616
Anyone hear from vera and alan?

36:59.618 --> 37:01.318
        No. Not a word.

37:01.320 --> 37:03.987
    (crowd applauds, cheers)

37:08.994 --> 37:11.428
   That's them.
   That's the plowmans.

37:11.430 --> 37:13.330
         Howdy, folks.

37:13.332 --> 37:15.699
 Plowman family farms is proud

37:15.701 --> 37:17.934
   To present to the world...

37:17.936 --> 37:21.605
The greatest agricultural
breakthrough in a century.

37:21.607 --> 37:25.375
 Tomorrow, at farms all across

37:25.377 --> 37:27.711
      The drought-stricken
        central valley,

37:27.713 --> 37:29.546
We launch a cutting-edge,

37:29.548 --> 37:32.282
   New rainmaking system--

37:32.284 --> 37:34.784
 One that not only seeds clouds

37:34.786 --> 37:36.953
    But also fortifies them

37:36.955 --> 37:39.689
      With a nutrient-rich
          water source

37:39.691 --> 37:41.524
We call...

37:41.526 --> 37:43.526
          Smart rain.

37:45.364 --> 37:47.364
   The tree in your vision--
   wasn't it killed by rain?

37:47.366 --> 37:49.266
Woman:
Yeah!

37:49.268 --> 37:51.568
Vincent:
Now as many of you
will realize, i am

37:51.570 --> 37:54.271
  Not exactly the science guy,

37:54.273 --> 37:56.773
So... Tell us a little bit more

37:56.775 --> 37:58.908
    About the nitty-gritty,
          the detail,

37:58.910 --> 38:00.977
My brother--

38:00.979 --> 38:04.347
The smarts behind smart rain--

38:04.349 --> 38:06.416
Mark plowman, everybody.

38:06.418 --> 38:08.051
                           Mark:
                      Thank you.

38:08.053 --> 38:11.721
           Thank you.

38:11.723 --> 38:13.590
  Our revolutionary technology

38:13.592 --> 38:15.625
        Begins with this
      specially designed,

38:15.627 --> 38:17.360
         Emission-free,

38:17.362 --> 38:19.596
      Cloud seeding drone.

38:21.066 --> 38:22.332
   (crowd applauds, whistles)

38:24.836 --> 38:27.337
Now, when this incredible
machine takes to the sky,

38:27.339 --> 38:28.672
                It's a two-stage

38:28.674 --> 38:30.440
Patented process.

38:30.442 --> 38:33.343
First the clouds are seeded with
a special nutrient-rich formula

38:33.345 --> 38:36.079
Mixed with the
rainmaking iodine crystals.

38:36.081 --> 38:37.714
  When the smart rain finally

38:37.715 --> 38:39.348
    Falls on our genetically
        enhanced seeds,

38:39.351 --> 38:42.319
Fallow fields will
spring to bountiful life,

38:42.321 --> 38:44.688
Increasing yields
tenfold.

38:44.690 --> 38:46.089
  We're not just talking about

38:46.091 --> 38:48.842
      Fruit and vegetables
        anymore, folks.

38:48.843 --> 38:51.594
  We are on the path
  to feeding the world.

38:51.596 --> 38:54.364
     (cheering, whistling)

39:06.078 --> 39:07.344
             What'd you see?

39:09.414 --> 39:12.115
                         Joshua:
     They claim the smart rain's
           gonna feed the world,

39:12.117 --> 39:14.684
But i just saw a knife cut
through a plowman bag of seed

39:14.686 --> 39:17.354
That was full
of nothing but bones.

39:17.356 --> 39:18.822
I'm worried if they
launch this technology

39:18.824 --> 39:20.390
They're gonna
break another seal.

39:22.994 --> 39:25.095
          Both brothers' faces
         are on on those bags.

39:25.097 --> 39:27.530
        So who's the horseman,
           vincent or mark?

39:27.532 --> 39:29.099
              Koa: Better figure
                   it out fast--

39:29.101 --> 39:31.468
       They're launching
      this thing tomorrow.

39:31.470 --> 39:32.802
What do we do,
go after both?

39:32.804 --> 39:34.637
Joshua: I wish
i could tell you. Look...

39:34.639 --> 39:37.140
 If there's one thing we should
  learn from rose, it's to not

39:37.142 --> 39:38.775
          Blindly follow anyone.

39:38.777 --> 39:41.544
This should be a democracy,
    not a dictatorship.

39:41.546 --> 39:44.514
We all know we need
to stop the horsemen.

39:44.516 --> 39:46.583
   So we should all
  decide what to do.

39:46.585 --> 39:48.985
          Okay.

39:48.987 --> 39:51.421
    Raul and i will see
what we can get out of mark.

39:51.423 --> 39:54.124
How about the three of us
track down vincent?

39:54.126 --> 39:55.625
Look, every generation
of the messengers

39:55.627 --> 39:56.793
Have stopped their horsemen.

39:56.795 --> 39:59.129
   If we have faith
     in ourselves,

39:59.131 --> 40:00.830
  And in each other...

40:00.832 --> 40:02.399
Then, by god, so will we.
Vincent: All right,

40:02.401 --> 40:04.601
          Enjoy yourself, party!

40:04.603 --> 40:06.403
      (applause, cheering)

40:06.405 --> 40:08.471
         (phone dings)

40:15.447 --> 40:18.481
What the hell?
How'd i get my money back?

40:33.698 --> 40:37.534
  (brakes squeak, doors open)

40:37.536 --> 40:38.935
              Hey!
       (car doors close)

40:38.937 --> 40:40.470
             Guys!

40:40.472 --> 40:41.671
             Alan?

40:41.673 --> 40:43.173
         Man (muffled):
          You got him?

40:43.175 --> 40:46.009
        Man 2 (muffled):
        Yeah, let's go.

40:46.011 --> 40:48.077
(mechanical whirring, rattling)

41:10.902 --> 41:13.736
  Man 1: Get him to smyrna right
   away-- we're behind schedule.
      (suv engine starts)

41:19.678 --> 41:20.743
        (pneumatic hiss)

41:22.781 --> 41:25.114
            Oh, no.

41:39.598 --> 41:40.597
   This cannot be happening.

41:40.599 --> 41:42.532
