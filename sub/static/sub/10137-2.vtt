a bit, but..

07:37.749 --> 07:39.334
...that's not it.

07:39.376 --> 07:40.668
Huh, Deej,

07:39.376 --> 07:40.668
what's the matter?

07:40.710 --> 07:41.836
We can

07:40.710 --> 07:41.836
finally be alone

07:41.878 --> 07:43.463

07:41.878 --> 07:43.463

07:43.504 --> 07:45.673
or your sisters,

07:43.504 --> 07:45.673
or your uncle, or your dog.

07:45.715 --> 07:48.009
You know, you have a lot of

07:45.715 --> 07:48.009
people living in that house.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.221
I'm sorry.

07:51.263 --> 07:53.181
I know that we've always

07:51.263 --> 07:53.181
wanted more freedom

07:53.223 --> 07:54.808
but now that

07:53.223 --> 07:54.808
we have it

07:54.849 --> 07:57.769
it's just

07:54.849 --> 07:57.769
a little scary.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.021
Maybe we can take

07:57.811 --> 08:00.021
things a little slower.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.441
Okay.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.110
No problem.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.112
- Steve..

08:05.152 --> 08:07.112
- No, Deej, I'm kidding.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.613
We could just

08:07.154 --> 08:08.613
hang out, it's cool.

08:08.655 --> 08:11.158
You know, I like just

08:08.655 --> 08:11.158
being here with you.

08:11.199 --> 08:12.492
Thank you.

08:12.533 --> 08:14.453
So, uh, you wanna

08:12.533 --> 08:14.453

08:14.494 --> 08:15.745
Sure. What do you have?

08:15.787 --> 08:17.205
I've got "Terminator"

08:17.247 --> 08:19.582
or "Indecent Proposal."

08:19.624 --> 08:21.835

08:19.624 --> 08:21.835
- "Terminator." Yeah.

08:27.466 --> 08:29.092

08:31.261 --> 08:33.305

08:31.261 --> 08:33.305

08:33.347 --> 08:34.348
Check out these figures.

08:34.389 --> 08:35.390
Okay, run 'em by me.

08:35.432 --> 08:36.808
Just so happens

08:35.432 --> 08:36.808

08:40.561 --> 08:41.980
Alright, let's crunch

08:40.561 --> 08:41.980
some numbers here.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.024
Take the cost of

08:42.022 --> 08:44.024
the truck rental for one day

08:44.065 --> 08:47.152
plus the cost of cement,

08:44.065 --> 08:47.152

08:47.194 --> 08:48.862
plus the cost

08:47.194 --> 08:48.862
of labor which is

08:48.903 --> 08:51.198
zippola.

08:51.239 --> 08:52.949
And what's your

08:51.239 --> 08:52.949
grand total?

08:52.991 --> 08:54.451
I don't know,

08:52.991 --> 08:54.451
but it took you

08:54.493 --> 08:57.120
nine seconds

08:54.493 --> 08:57.120
to say all that.

08:57.162 --> 08:58.455
I'll get it.

09:00.415 --> 09:02.250
Hey, guys, I'm really

09:00.415 --> 09:02.250

09:02.292 --> 09:03.502
She was supposed to

09:02.292 --> 09:03.502
be home at 11 o'clock

09:03.543 --> 09:05.586
and it's already

09:03.543 --> 09:05.586
past midnight.

09:05.628 --> 09:07.506
It is?

09:07.547 --> 09:08.631
Oh, man.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.426
I should have

09:09.716 --> 09:11.426
never let her go.

09:11.468 --> 09:14.388
- What kind of father am I?

09:11.468 --> 09:14.388
- Danny, you're a great father.

09:14.429 --> 09:16.639
What's the big deal? Just,

09:14.429 --> 09:16.639
just call her. Where is she?

09:16.681 --> 09:18.392
She's at Steve's new apartment.

09:16.681 --> 09:18.392
I don't have the number.

09:18.433 --> 09:21.353
What? What kind

09:18.433 --> 09:21.353
of father are you?

09:21.395 --> 09:22.770
Alright, guys,

09:21.395 --> 09:22.770
just settle down.

09:22.812 --> 09:24.731
- She went out with Kimmy.

09:22.812 --> 09:24.731
- Yeah.

09:24.772 --> 09:26.358
So, let's just call

09:24.772 --> 09:26.358
over at the Gibblers

09:26.400 --> 09:27.901
and find out

09:26.400 --> 09:27.901
what's going on.

09:29.152 --> 09:30.653

It's Mr. Tanner.

09:54.135 --> 09:56.012
I'm looking for D.J.

09:56.054 --> 09:58.098
I thought you were with

09:56.054 --> 09:58.098
her at Steve's apartment?

My parents wouldn't let me in

They have rules, you know?

10:06.189 --> 10:07.566
I don't have time

10:06.189 --> 10:07.566
for this, alright?

10:07.607 --> 10:09.568

15:08.115 --> 15:09.200
some numbers.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.035
(Joey)

15:09.242 --> 15:11.035
'My watch!'

15:11.077 --> 15:12.704
We're gonna run the mixer

15:11.077 --> 15:12.704
or the cement's gonna harden.

15:12.746 --> 15:14.038
Give me those keys.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.418
Uh.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.546
Uh, yes.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.256
I'm a bird.

15:23.297 --> 15:26.300
I'm soaring through

15:23.297 --> 15:26.300
a quiet meadow!

15:28.845 --> 15:32.014
Stephanie, I found a new

15:28.845 --> 15:32.014
hobby. You want to see?

15:32.056 --> 15:33.808
Sure. Why not?

15:35.685 --> 15:37.896
I'm collecting leaves.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.402
What are you, nuts?

15:44.444 --> 15:45.986
This is just

15:44.444 --> 15:45.986
from the backyard.

15:46.028 --> 15:48.197
I still have

15:46.028 --> 15:48.197
the front yard to do.

15:49.407 --> 15:52.076
Look at this!

15:49.407 --> 15:52.076
It's all over my stuff.

15:52.118 --> 15:55.622
Hey, those are the ones

15:52.118 --> 15:55.622
with the little bugs on them!

15:57.039 --> 15:58.207
Bugs?

15:58.249 --> 16:00.042
That's it.

16:00.084 --> 16:03.087
Dumb hobby, coming down!

16:04.547 --> 16:06.173
Oh, yeah?

16:10.261 --> 16:12.221
That was my shoe!

16:13.598 --> 16:15.767
And that was the other one.

16:17.351 --> 16:19.228
Okay, fine!

16:20.354 --> 16:22.315
Fine, here's

16:20.354 --> 16:22.315
Mr. Piggly-Wiggly.

16:22.356 --> 16:23.983
There goes Mr. Tiger.

16:24.024 --> 16:26.068
And your little bunny.

16:26.110 --> 16:28.195
- And Teddy.

16:26.110 --> 16:28.195
- And your books.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.490
[vacuum cleaner whirring]

16:30.531 --> 16:32.826
I don't believe it.

16:30.531 --> 16:32.826
Here he comes again.

16:34.076 --> 16:35.202
Oh, you're in here!

16:35.244 --> 16:36.287
He's hovered us out

16:36.329 --> 16:37.956
of every room in the house.

16:38.623 --> 16:39.833
Don't mind me.

16:39.874 --> 16:41.709
Excuse. Thanks.

16:43.336 --> 16:46.380
Dad, I really need

16:43.336 --> 16:46.380
to talk to Steve.

16:46.422 --> 16:47.590
Oh, go ahead and talk.

16:47.632 --> 16:48.675
I'm-I'm just counting down

16:48.716 --> 16:51.678
to the next bag change.

16:51.719 --> 16:53.429
Well, don't let

16:51.719 --> 16:53.429
us bother you.

16:56.307 --> 16:57.767
D.J.

16:57.809 --> 17:00.353
- Dad! Dad! Dad!

17:00.394 --> 17:02.939
Stephanie's throwing

17:00.394 --> 17:02.939
my hobby out the window.

17:02.981 --> 17:05.900
I had to. I need a leaf

17:02.981 --> 17:05.900
blower just to get to my bed.

17:05.942 --> 17:06.985
She's crazy.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.945
- I am not!

17:07.026 --> 17:08.945
- 'Oh, yeah?'

17:08.987 --> 17:10.905
Then why did you throw

17:08.987 --> 17:10.905
Mr. Bear out the window?

17:10.947 --> 17:13.950
'Cause I couldn't

17:10.947 --> 17:13.950
lift your desk!

17:13.992 --> 17:15.493
[indistinct shouting]

17:15.535 --> 17:17.620
Girls. Girls. Girls!

17:17.662 --> 17:18.788
Hello?

17:18.830 --> 17:20.748
I'm not in the mood

17:18.830 --> 17:20.748
for this, alright?

17:20.790 --> 17:22.291
First thing you're gonna do,

17:20.790 --> 17:22.291
you're gotta rake up the leaves

17:22.333 --> 17:23.793
and then you're gonna

17:22.333 --> 17:23.793
rake up the bears

17:23.835 --> 17:25.378
and then you're gonna kiss,

17:23.835 --> 17:25.378
and you're gonna hug

17:25.419 --> 17:27.046
and you're gonna apologize

17:25.419 --> 17:27.046
because you're sisters

17:27.087 --> 17:30.925
and you love each other,

17:27.087 --> 17:30.925
okay? Case closed. Thanks.

17:30.967 --> 17:33.678
Oh, boy. He really

17:30.967 --> 17:33.678
streamlined that dad talk.

17:34.679 --> 17:37.807
Yeah. We got off pretty easy.

17:37.849 --> 17:40.100
(Danny)

17:37.849 --> 17:40.100
'Look at the mess in here!'

17:41.435 --> 17:42.979
Maybe not.

17:54.156 --> 17:55.658
[both sighing]

17:55.700 --> 17:58.118
Look how low we've sunk

17:55.700 --> 17:58.118
just to get some privacy.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.871
Sitting in this grungy

17:58.160 --> 17:59.871
truck when we could

17:59.913 --> 18:03.165
we could be sitting

17:59.913 --> 18:03.165
in my grungy apartment.

18:03.207 --> 18:04.751
You know, I've never

18:03.207 --> 18:04.751
noticed that before.

18:04.792 --> 18:06.419
What?

18:06.460 --> 18:09.589
The way your nostrils

18:06.460 --> 18:09.589
flare when you get angry.

18:09.630 --> 18:10.840
It's kind of sexy.

18:10.882 --> 18:12.008
Really?

18:16.303 --> 18:18.222
Well, to a point.

18:26.940 --> 18:28.649
[machine whirring]

18:28.691 --> 18:30.234
I am at peace.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.862
[glass shattering]

18:35.907 --> 18:38.701
And I am soaring..

18:38.743 --> 18:40.160
...flowing.

18:43.456 --> 18:46.667
Man, what a mess

18:43.456 --> 18:46.667
up there, Jess.

18:46.709 --> 18:49.169
Is there anything worse than

18:46.709 --> 18:49.169
ground leaves in a carpet?

18:52.924 --> 18:54.467
Yep.

18:55.301 --> 18:56.970
My kitchen!

18:57.011 --> 18:59.847
Joey, do something!

18:59.889 --> 19:01.724
I'll-I'll, uh, I'll try

18:59.889 --> 19:01.724
to keep it from spreading!

19:01.766 --> 19:03.101
You take care

19:01.766 --> 19:03.101
of the chute!

19:09.231 --> 19:11.734
Not your shirt! Get a bowl!

19:11.776 --> 19:12.902
- A bowl, right!

19:11.776 --> 19:12.902
- A bowl!

19:12.944 --> 19:15.279
- Good.

19:12.944 --> 19:15.279
- Oh, no!

19:15.321 --> 19:16.781
Here, I got a bowl.

19:15.321 --> 19:16.781
I got a bowl.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.282
No, no, no!

19:16.823 --> 19:18.282
Not that bowl!

19:18.324 --> 19:19.742
That's my fine China!

19:19.784 --> 19:22.328
- Oh, oh.

19:19.784 --> 19:22.328
- Alright.

19:22.369 --> 19:25.164
(Danny)

19:22.369 --> 19:25.164
'Oh...oh, no.'

19:27.959 --> 19:30.753
- Oh!

19:27.959 --> 19:30.753
- No, no, no! Not that bowl!

19:30.795 --> 19:33.464
My mother gave me that!

19:33.506 --> 19:36.216
Oh, Jesse!

19:36.258 --> 19:37.802
How about this drawer?

19:37.844 --> 19:40.262
Do have any emotional

19:37.844 --> 19:40.262
attachment to the drawer?

19:40.304 --> 19:42.140
No. I mean, I

19:40.304 --> 19:42.140
like it, but, uh..

19:46.310 --> 19:48.104
I'm going down!

19:49.522 --> 19:53.567
You know, uh...this, uh,

19:49.522 --> 19:53.567
this broom is not working.

19:55.402 --> 19:57.488
Turn off the truck!

19:57.530 --> 19:59.406
Turn off the truck.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.406
Why didn't I think of that?

19:59.448 --> 20:01.200
You know, it's weird when your

19:59.448 --> 20:01.200
adrenaline's running like this

20:01.241 --> 20:02.910
you forget the most obvious

20:01.241 --> 20:02.910
thing that you could be doing.

20:02.952 --> 20:04.411
- The truck, Dan.

20:02.952 --> 20:04.411
- 'The truck.'

20:04.453 --> 20:05.705
I'll turn off the truck.

20:05.746 --> 20:08.207
That's what

20:05.746 --> 20:08.207
I'll do. Uh! Oh!

20:10.877 --> 20:12.252
Joey!

20:13.171 --> 20:15.339
Sniff the minty woodlands.

20:16.966 --> 20:21.261
There. Now, aren't

20:16.966 --> 20:21.261
we calm and placid?

20:21.303 --> 20:24.390
[instrumental music]

20:27.434 --> 20:28.561
[knocking on door]

20:29.228 --> 20:30.563
It's open.

20:32.023 --> 20:34.316
Dad, I know I've been

20:32.023 --> 20:34.316
saying this a lot lately

20:34.358 --> 20:37.319
but I'm really, really sorry.

20:37.361 --> 20:38.445
I know you are, Deej.

20:38.487 --> 20:39.864
And no matter how long it takes

20:39.906 --> 20:42.408
I'm gonna pay you

20:39.906 --> 20:42.408
back for that mess.

20:42.449 --> 20:44.952
Oh, I know you will.

20:44.994 --> 20:47.038
We'll work out something,

20:44.994 --> 20:47.038
but, uh, right now

20:47.080 --> 20:49.916
there's something else that

20:47.080 --> 20:49.916
we have to work out first.

20:49.957 --> 20:52.001
What did I do now?

20:52.043 --> 20:54.336
Well, actually, it's-it's-it's

20:52.043 --> 20:54.336
something that I did.

20:54.378 --> 20:56.714
Um...I don't know

20:54.378 --> 20:56.714
if you've noticed

20:56.756 --> 20:59.092
but, uh, I was kind

20:56.756 --> 20:59.092
of following you around

20:59.133 --> 21:01.719
with the vacuum cleaner today.

21:01.761 --> 21:04.764
I thought that was you.

21:04.805 --> 21:06.432
Yeah.

21:06.473 --> 21:09.102
Well, I, uh..

21:09.143 --> 21:10.519
...I didn't really

21:09.143 --> 21:10.519
respect your privacy.

21:10.561 --> 21:12.479
So, uh, in a way,

21:10.561 --> 21:12.479
I think I kinda

21:12.521 --> 21:14.774
forced you and Steve

21:12.521 --> 21:14.774
into that cement truck.

21:16.358 --> 21:18.736
What I really wanted to

21:16.358 --> 21:18.736
do was just talk to you

21:18.778 --> 21:21.572
about what I was feeling last

21:18.778 --> 21:21.572
night at Steve's apartment.

21:21.614 --> 21:24.242
Dad, I knew what

21:21.614 --> 21:24.242
you were feeling.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.577
Steve's whole building

21:24.283 --> 21:26.577
knew what you were feeling.

21:28.454 --> 21:31.290
Maybe I overreacted

21:28.454 --> 21:31.290
just a tad, huh?

21:31.331 --> 21:34.877
Dad, I tried to explain to you,

21:31.331 --> 21:34.877
but you wouldn't listen to me.

21:34.919 --> 21:37.088
You were treating me like

21:34.919 --> 21:37.088
I was a little kid again.

21:37.130 --> 21:38.631
I know, I know.

21:38.672 --> 21:41.383
I'm...I'm really sorry, Deej.

21:41.425 --> 21:43.177
All I kept thinking

21:41.425 --> 21:43.177
about was Cathy Santoni

21:43.219 --> 21:45.096
a girl your age

21:43.219 --> 21:45.096
having a baby.

21:45.138 --> 21:47.014
And then I saw you

21:45.138 --> 21:47.014
and Steve on the couch.

21:47.056 --> 21:48.307
You saw us?

21:48.348 --> 21:50.643
Well, briefly, until

21:48.348 --> 21:50.643
the chair gave out.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.896
Dad, nothing happened.

21:55.022 --> 21:56.398
I know.

21:58.525 --> 22:00.444
Everything's just

21:58.525 --> 22:00.444
getting so complicated.

22:00.486 --> 22:02.071
I mean, you're

22:00.486 --> 22:02.071
a young woman now

22:02.113 --> 22:03.864
you're in a serious

22:02.113 --> 22:03.864
relationship with a boy

22:03.906 --> 22:07.118
and he's got his

22:03.906 --> 22:07.118
own apartment.

22:07.160 --> 22:09.287
I guess, uh, I guess

22:07.160 --> 22:09.287
if your mom were around

22:09.328 --> 22:11.956
things would be a lot easier.

22:11.998 --> 22:14.583
Dad, you're doing fine.

22:14.625 --> 22:16.127
You don't have to worry.

22:16.169 --> 22:18.296
I'm not Cathy Santoni.

22:20.006 --> 22:22.424
Dad, there are so many things

22:20.006 --> 22:22.424
that I want to do and see

22:22.466 --> 22:25.094
before I get married

22:22.466 --> 22:25.094
and have a family.

22:26.304 --> 22:27.972
This is so nice to hear.

22:28.014 --> 22:30.266
[chuckles]

22:30.308 --> 22:32.434
We should have these

22:30.308 --> 22:32.434
talks more often.

22:32.476 --> 22:34.352
Anytime, dad.

22:34.394 --> 22:35.855
I love you.

22:35.896 --> 22:37.481
I love you too.

22:42.569 --> 22:45.031
Oh, uh, one more thing

22:42.569 --> 22:45.031
about Steve's apartment--

22:45.072 --> 22:48.201
No, it's okay.

22:45.072 --> 22:48.201
You can go. I trust you.

22:48.242 --> 22:49.994
As long as you're back

22:48.242 --> 22:49.994
by curfew, alright?

22:50.036 --> 22:51.411
Thanks, dad.

22:50.036 --> 22:51.411
That's great.

22:51.453 --> 22:53.789
But what I was going to say is..

22:53.831 --> 22:55.457
...Steve's landlord

22:53.831 --> 22:55.457
says you owe him 30 bucks

22:55.499 --> 22:57.501
for that chair you broke.

22:57.543 --> 22:58.752
What?

22:58.794 --> 23:00.213
That piece of junk?

23:00.254 --> 23:02.715
[indistinct chattering]

23:07.385 --> 23:08.971
[clanking]

23:09.013 --> 23:10.806
- Don't move.

23:09.013 --> 23:10.806
- Don't move?

23:10.848 --> 23:13.351
Where the heck am I going?

23:13.391 --> 23:15.393
- Hey, I found something.

23:13.391 --> 23:15.393
- 'What?'

23:15.435 --> 23:16.937
Look at this.
