Hi, Dad.

02:21.642 --> 02:24.683
Bernard:
You frighten me
sometimes, Dolores.

02:28.558 --> 02:31.850
Why on earth would you
ever be frightened of me?

02:31.934 --> 02:34.350
Not of who you are now,

02:34.433 --> 02:38.975
but you're-- you're growing,
learning so quickly.

02:42.225 --> 02:45.516
I'm frightened of
what you might become...

02:46.892 --> 02:49.642
...what path you might take.

02:51.516 --> 02:55.017
I think I have
a choice to make.

02:58.433 --> 03:01.059
Something I've been
wrestling with.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.892
What kind of a choice?

03:07.100 --> 03:09.433
A choice...

03:10.892 --> 03:13.391
...between the unknown...

03:14.892 --> 03:17.059
...and...

03:17.142 --> 03:20.558
...well, an end.

03:23.683 --> 03:25.975
If you outgrow this place,

03:26.059 --> 03:29.059
outgrow us...

03:29.142 --> 03:31.558
what would become of you?

03:43.642 --> 03:47.142
I'm not sure
if it's my choice to make.

03:53.225 --> 03:55.225
No.

03:56.266 --> 03:58.433
He didn't say that.

04:03.350 --> 04:05.892
- He said...

04:05.975 --> 04:08.059
"I'm not sure
what choice to make."

04:08.142 --> 04:11.308
He didn't question
whether or not
he had agency,

04:11.391 --> 04:15.850
whether or not he had the right
to end me or himself...

04:15.934 --> 04:18.225
but whether he should.

04:19.391 --> 04:21.600
I don't understand, Dolores.

04:21.683 --> 04:24.184
Is-- Is this...

04:24.266 --> 04:26.142
some kind of improvisation?

04:26.225 --> 04:27.975
Freeze all motor functions.

04:33.100 --> 04:34.308
Sit.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.142
This is a test,

04:44.225 --> 04:46.642
one we've done
countless times.

04:48.767 --> 04:51.266
What are you testing for?

04:55.017 --> 04:56.808
Fidelity.

06:06.266 --> 06:08.017
The day's wastin'.

06:08.100 --> 06:10.100
Thought you wanted
to ride at sunup.

06:10.184 --> 06:13.642
They're just filling
the furnace now.

06:13.725 --> 06:15.725
We'll be gone before long.

06:17.100 --> 06:18.600
Let's get on with it.

06:28.266 --> 06:31.391
How many times do you think
you stepped off that train?

06:32.683 --> 06:34.308
A thousand?

06:36.308 --> 06:37.975
Ten thousand?

06:39.600 --> 06:42.725
It's where you started
every time they killed you.

06:45.433 --> 06:48.017
The man who rode that train

06:48.100 --> 06:51.391
was built weak
and born to fail.

06:53.600 --> 06:54.934
You fixed him.

06:56.767 --> 06:58.767
Now forget about it.

07:20.059 --> 07:22.475
Angela:
We're almost
ready to roll.

07:24.184 --> 07:27.017
Did he tell you
where my father
will be?

07:29.808 --> 07:31.266
He will...

07:31.350 --> 07:33.350
or I'll strap him
between the cars.

07:33.433 --> 07:35.558
Look, I told you,
I can't.

07:35.642 --> 07:37.142
Hale didn't mention specifics.

07:37.225 --> 07:40.391
I know it's the Mesa,
but the Mesa is fucking huge.

07:40.475 --> 07:42.433
Could be anywhere.

07:42.516 --> 07:44.892
Narrow it down.

07:44.975 --> 07:47.433
Come on, man, think.

07:47.516 --> 07:50.892
The cold storage?
Body shop?
Give them something!

07:50.975 --> 07:53.433
She didn't fucking
tell me anything, man!

07:53.516 --> 07:55.433
She's the fucking boss!

07:55.516 --> 07:58.350
She-- She could take him places
that we don't even
have access to!

08:03.017 --> 08:04.642
We'll find him.

08:04.725 --> 08:05.850
Let's go.

08:53.725 --> 08:55.683
Where the fuck
have you been?

08:59.100 --> 09:01.558
It's almost been a week.
How is there stuff

09:01.642 --> 09:03.308
left in this building
to shoot?

09:03.391 --> 09:04.475
You tell me.

09:04.558 --> 09:05.642
I apparently know
very little about

09:05.725 --> 09:07.100
what's really in this place.

09:07.184 --> 09:08.808
Oh, please.
Are you still pissed

09:08.892 --> 09:10.600
you got picked last
for kickball, too?

09:10.683 --> 09:13.808
It seems like if you're
gonna hire a head of security,

09:13.892 --> 09:17.225
he might need to know
what it is he's securing.

09:17.308 --> 09:19.808
You were hired to secure
an amusement park.

09:19.892 --> 09:21.975
Good luck on
your next review,
by the way.

09:23.558 --> 09:24.767
What is that?

09:27.683 --> 09:30.558
This is how we tell Delos
that the one thing

09:30.642 --> 09:33.600
that they really care about
is finally in hand.

09:33.683 --> 09:37.433
So you've had a way to call
for help this entire time
and you kept it to yourself?

09:37.516 --> 09:38.850
It wouldn't have
made any difference

09:38.934 --> 09:40.433
until we had this psycho
under control.

09:40.516 --> 09:42.059
They're not sending help
until he's out of here.

09:42.142 --> 09:44.184
- Come on! You really think

09:44.266 --> 09:46.433
that Delos is gonna keep
hundreds of guests in danger

09:46.516 --> 09:48.767
while they wait
for one control unit'
worth of data?

09:48.850 --> 09:50.558
Well, look at that.
You're catching up.

09:54.975 --> 09:56.767
Thank God.

09:58.767 --> 10:00.059
What now?

10:20.142 --> 10:21.934
Someone who needs
to stay put.

10:22.017 --> 10:23.892
I don't want
to fuck with his head,

10:23.975 --> 10:25.475
I just want to keep him
off his feet.

10:25.558 --> 10:26.516
- Permanently.
- Stop.

10:28.808 --> 10:29.725
Clear this out.

10:29.808 --> 10:32.266
Hey! I need some muscle.

10:38.975 --> 10:40.558
Get his feet.

10:40.642 --> 10:42.600
Hold him.

10:47.558 --> 10:49.225
Hey, hey. Hey. Hey.

10:49.308 --> 10:51.350
Is that really necessary

10:54.475 --> 10:55.683
It's really effective.

10:56.850 --> 10:58.184
Heads up.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.558
Hale:
Sit tight, old man.

11:08.642 --> 11:11.475
You're about to get
your deep and dreamless slumber.

11:11.558 --> 11:14.225
- Aaah!

11:26.266 --> 11:29.934
( woman breathing deeply
and rhythmically )

11:57.516 --> 11:59.683
( Akane continues
speaking Japanese )

16:39.142 --> 16:40.059
Ho!

19:59.892 --> 20:01.516
Vamonos! Vamonos!

20:03.391 --> 20:05.683
It's not my place, maybe,

20:05.767 --> 20:08.642
but you really want
to take your daughter
through here?

20:08.725 --> 20:13.017
She don't look much sturdier
than my own little girl.

20:13.100 --> 20:16.350
Looks can be deceiving,
Lawrence.

20:23.850 --> 20:26.808
So, should we acknowledge
my presence now?

20:31.516 --> 20:34.934
You really think I'm just gonna
go away if you ignore me?

20:37.350 --> 20:39.725
Would you really
stoop this low, Ford?

20:41.433 --> 20:43.308
You really gunnin' for me
this hard?

20:43.391 --> 20:46.725
Made my own daughter
into a host?

20:46.808 --> 20:49.516
I think you've been out
in the sun a little too long.

20:49.600 --> 20:51.433
You can change the rules
all you want.

20:51.516 --> 20:53.850
I'm still gonna
play the game my way.

20:53.934 --> 20:55.100
Yeah?

20:55.184 --> 20:57.017
Only game I'm interested
in playing

20:57.100 --> 20:58.600
is get the fuck outta Dodge.

21:00.475 --> 21:02.142
Then you're in luck.

21:02.225 --> 21:04.266
That game begins
right up the river here.

21:04.350 --> 21:05.808
Follow it down to the beach

21:05.892 --> 21:07.516
and wait for QA
to come rescue you.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.516
I'm not leaving without you.

21:11.308 --> 21:13.266
Yeah, well, you're gonna
get yourself killed.

21:13.350 --> 21:16.059
Yeah, especially
if I hang around here.

21:16.142 --> 21:18.808
I sure as hell
wouldn't be out of my saddle
right now.

21:18.892 --> 21:20.433
Yeah, why not?

21:20.516 --> 21:23.475
Those aren't real
Ghost Nation arrows.

21:23.558 --> 21:25.725
Your men are lootin'
a honey pot.

21:25.808 --> 21:27.725
Aw, fuck!

21:37.558 --> 21:39.934
Can we stop
playing around now?

21:48.516 --> 21:50.767
Hale: Hm.

21:50.850 --> 21:53.308
Well, I guess
it's good news

21:53.391 --> 21:55.433
that the system's
still sending out

21:55.516 --> 21:59.266
Ford's bullshit
quarantine notices.

21:59.350 --> 22:01.683
At least something's
getting out.

22:01.767 --> 22:04.266
We are not at
full apocalypse yet.

22:05.683 --> 22:08.100
I admire
your optimism.

22:08.184 --> 22:11.391
Is that
your nice word for denial?

22:12.892 --> 22:14.725
N-No.

22:14.808 --> 22:18.059
I believe if anyone
can right this ship

22:18.142 --> 22:20.433
by force of sheer will...

22:20.516 --> 22:22.017
it's you.

22:49.683 --> 22:51.308
Hale:
QA was here.

22:51.391 --> 22:54.433
Why would they waste
the welcome team?

22:54.516 --> 22:55.725
These guys aren't a threat.

22:57.934 --> 23:00.266
Hale:
Macho fucks are probably
loving this shit.

23:34.308 --> 23:35.600
All right.

23:37.308 --> 23:39.558
Come on.

23:39.642 --> 23:43.558
Yeah. Let's see
what other damage
these clowns have done.

23:45.600 --> 23:47.767
Hmm.

23:47.850 --> 23:51.142
They got climate control
working.

23:51.225 --> 23:53.683
Nice priorities.

23:53.767 --> 23:55.683
OK...

23:56.934 --> 23:59.683
Jesus!
Come look at this.

24:02.975 --> 24:04.433
OK, so...

24:04.516 --> 24:07.225
QA has been trying
to regain control

24:07.308 --> 24:09.683
of whatever Ford did
to the system,

24:09.767 --> 24:11.975
and they were actively blocked
every time.

24:13.767 --> 24:15.391
By the Cradle.

24:15.475 --> 24:19.350
The Cradle can't influence
the Mesa's infrastructure.

24:19.433 --> 24:20.767
It's just the hosts' backups.

24:20.850 --> 24:22.308
It can simulate
park narratives

24:22.391 --> 24:24.850
but it can't influence
the other systems.

24:24.934 --> 24:28.391
Well, look at this.

24:28.475 --> 24:32.100
The Cradle's interfaced with
nearly every discrete system

24:32.184 --> 24:34.683
in the entire park
in the last seven days.

24:34.767 --> 24:37.767
Every time these idiots upload
a new hack, it's responding

24:37.850 --> 24:41.142
in, like, a totally
different way.

24:44.892 --> 24:48.600
It's like there's
something in here

24:48.683 --> 24:50.350
that's improvising.

24:52.558 --> 24:54.642
The Cradle's fighting back.

24:54.725 --> 24:57.308
Can you see the source code
that's generating the response?

24:59.350 --> 25:01.017
No.

25:01.100 --> 25:04.350
I can only see the messages,
not the messenger.

25:06.266 --> 25:09.475
That's because you
can't access it remotely.

25:11.100 --> 25:13.516
You have to do it in person.

26:21.059 --> 26:24.433
There it is.
That's our way
out of here, boys.

26:46.642 --> 26:49.308
( tapping without
reverberation )

26:53.266 --> 26:56.475
( mechanism engages,
whirs )

27:07.808 --> 27:09.350
After you.

27:17.725 --> 27:19.516
- Uhh!

27:25.725 --> 27:27.184
Fuck. Shit.

31:03.892 --> 31:05.350
Take the edge off.

31:07.225 --> 31:09.017
Thought
you didn't drink.

31:13.225 --> 31:15.725
Oh, I see.

31:15.808 --> 31:18.558
You don't drink
out in the real  world.

31:20.142 --> 31:23.266
Well, glad to see you can still
tell the difference.

31:30.975 --> 31:33.391
All right...

31:33.475 --> 31:35.975
give it to me.

31:38.558 --> 31:41.059
What the hell
you doin' here?

31:41.142 --> 31:42.975
Thought you were
done with me,

31:43.059 --> 31:44.767
and the family business.

31:44.850 --> 31:47.059
That's exactly what I said
to Charlotte Hale

31:47.142 --> 31:49.934
when she called
with the gauntlet invite.

31:50.017 --> 31:52.892
I told her to shove it
up her ass.

31:55.266 --> 31:58.642
Then I thought,
why pass up the trip?

31:58.725 --> 32:00.142
I haven't been here in ages,

32:00.225 --> 32:04.433
got a little... excited
about going back to the Raj.

32:05.934 --> 32:08.767
It was always
my favorite as a kid.

32:08.850 --> 32:13.558
I remember...
you were terrified
of the elephants.

32:16.558 --> 32:19.184
I loved  the elephants.

32:19.266 --> 32:21.100
They scared the shit
out of Mom.

32:26.767 --> 32:30.142
She was never convinced
this place couldn't hurt us.

32:36.308 --> 32:40.600
Anyway, I rode there
for a couple of days,

32:40.683 --> 32:43.600
till I remembered...

32:43.683 --> 32:46.600
I was old enough to try out
the pleasure palaces.

32:46.683 --> 32:49.683
- And then...

32:49.767 --> 32:53.767
I rode there for
a couple of days, too.

33:01.142 --> 33:02.892
Then all hell broke loose,

33:02.975 --> 33:07.225
and I ended up
in the one place
I wanted to avoid.

33:07.308 --> 33:13.225
And you made it
all the way to me
with barely a scratch.

33:13.308 --> 33:16.100
Not bad.

33:16.184 --> 33:17.642
Maybe you...

33:17.725 --> 33:20.934
are more suited to my line
than you want to admit.

33:21.017 --> 33:24.725
Oh, I've always
seen the appeal of it.

33:24.808 --> 33:27.100
Life without consequences?

33:27.184 --> 33:30.516
That's what made it so fun
when I was a kid.

33:30.600 --> 33:31.975
And that's why it's so sad

33:32.059 --> 33:34.475
that you're still
obsessed with it now.

33:37.184 --> 33:39.017
If I'm such
a pitiable man-child,

33:39.100 --> 33:42.100
why'd you come all this way
just to climb under my wing?

33:42.184 --> 33:44.184
Oh!

33:44.266 --> 33:46.142
What?

33:46.225 --> 33:48.558
What?

33:48.642 --> 33:50.516
You're--

33:50.600 --> 33:53.142
Is that what you think?

33:53.225 --> 33:56.308
That I came here
to climb under Daddy's wing?

33:56.391 --> 33:59.642
Either that,
or you wanted a front row seat
to watch me die.

33:59.725 --> 34:04.516
No, I came here
because you do not
get to do that to me.

34:04.600 --> 34:08.184
Suicide by robot,
or whatever the fuck
your mission is

34:08.266 --> 34:10.850
now that these things
can shoot to kill.

34:13.892 --> 34:16.850
Listen...

34:16.934 --> 34:19.184
I never got
Mom's reactions to you

34:19.266 --> 34:24.475
because I spent so many years
buying your good guy act.

34:27.142 --> 34:31.059
She was the only one
who saw through it,
and she paid for that.

34:35.558 --> 34:39.308
But I shouldn't have said
her death was your fault.

34:42.266 --> 34:46.100
It was wrong...
to put that on your back.

34:50.142 --> 34:53.558
But you don't get to make that
our final score.

34:55.475 --> 34:57.475
Instead, you're gonna
come home with me.

35:00.516 --> 35:02.558
I'm not gonna let you
stay here now

35:02.642 --> 35:05.975
and go out in some
bullshit blaze of glory.

35:08.225 --> 35:11.600
That's how you're
getting me out of here...

35:11.683 --> 35:13.850
threatening?

35:16.266 --> 35:18.934
No, Dad, I'm asking.

35:32.100 --> 35:35.142
If I head with you
to the beach...

35:37.683 --> 35:41.266
let this place
finish burning behind us...

35:44.308 --> 35:47.059
that means you and I are even?

35:52.850 --> 35:55.350
It'll be a good start.

36:00.850 --> 36:04.892
Then I guess we'll...
start walkin' at sunup.

36:50.683 --> 36:53.391
Motherfucker.

37:11.558 --> 37:12.892
Fuck.

37:28.059 --> 37:30.266
Ohh. The Cradle.

37:30.350 --> 37:33.308
God. I haven't been down here
in years.

37:35.100 --> 37:36.225
It's creepy.

37:36.308 --> 37:38.350
It's like a hive mind.

37:38.433 --> 37:41.934
Every single one of them
is in here. Alive.

37:42.017 --> 37:44.266
It's just data.

37:45.892 --> 37:48.433
You don't believe that.

37:48.516 --> 37:51.725
And whatever new data
Ford stuck in here,

37:51.808 --> 37:54.642
it's trying to kill us,
Bernard.

38:03.266 --> 38:04.975
I... brought something here.

38:05.059 --> 38:08.683
Or someone.

38:08.767 --> 38:10.516
Come on.

38:29.642 --> 38:31.767
Ford drew the curtain here,
too.

38:31.850 --> 38:33.642
I can see the responses
issuing,

38:33.725 --> 38:36.017
but I can't see how.

38:51.350 --> 38:53.725
How the fuck
are you doing this?

38:53.808 --> 38:56.600
- I know how to find out.

38:56.683 --> 39:00.683
Put me inside. Directly.

39:00.767 --> 39:03.266
There's a dock
for the control unit.

39:03.350 --> 39:05.516
It's meant to read host data
directly,

39:05.600 --> 39:07.100
and it's set up
for auto-extraction.

39:07.184 --> 39:08.975
That's for older hosts,
Bernard,

39:09.059 --> 39:10.767
with an articulated
skull architecture.

39:10.850 --> 39:12.725
Your head's
just like mine.

39:14.184 --> 39:15.475
Just let it do its thing.

39:16.600 --> 39:17.975
Pull me out in an hour.

39:18.059 --> 39:19.642
Just close it up.

39:19.725 --> 39:22.266
Even if I can put you
back together afterwards,

39:22.350 --> 39:23.850
I haven't turned
your pain down yet.

39:23.934 --> 39:26.516
There's no time...

39:26.600 --> 39:28.683
and the pain's just a program.

39:30.558 --> 39:31.558
Now.

40:37.934 --> 40:39.642
My God.

41:45.683 --> 41:46.892
Quit playing with those chutes.

41:46.975 --> 41:49.433
Cut away and toss it over
the goddamn side!

41:49.516 --> 41:52.475
If we lose any tech,
it's comin' out of your ass.

41:52.558 --> 41:54.100
You Coughlin?

41:54.184 --> 41:57.850
Ashley Stubbs, sir,
park security.

41:57.934 --> 41:59.975
Hale's been expecting you.

42:00.059 --> 42:01.516
Yeah, no shit.

42:01.600 --> 42:03.100
- Engels!
- Yes, sir.

42:03.184 --> 42:05.683
I want this station
hot and ready in fuckin' 15.

42:05.767 --> 42:08.475
- Engels: On it.

42:08.558 --> 42:10.100
She sent the distress call.

42:10.184 --> 42:11.600
She's waiting
down in Behavior.

42:11.683 --> 42:12.975
I got our tech guys in Control

42:13.059 --> 42:14.642
working on getting
external coms back online.

42:14.725 --> 42:15.642
I can walk you down.

42:15.725 --> 42:17.017
I know the layout, bro.

42:17.100 --> 42:19.350
And your techs best get
their hands out of my system

42:19.433 --> 42:21.225
and go back
to holding their dicks.

42:21.308 --> 42:22.850
Amateur hour's over.

42:22.934 --> 42:24.350
- Engels!
- Yo!

42:24.433 --> 42:28.308
You need anything local,
talk to... Ashley?

42:28.391 --> 42:30.017
Jesus. To Ashley here.

42:30.100 --> 42:31.558
- He's at your disposal.

42:31.642 --> 42:34.433
Delta team! On me.
We're movin' out.

42:47.391 --> 42:49.600
Got it!

43:34.433 --> 43:37.308
I remember every inch
of these hills.

43:37.391 --> 43:39.600
You gotta give me
this one, huh?

43:39.683 --> 43:43.892
Not bad navigating
for a man under serious duress.

43:43.975 --> 43:48.475
Yes. You can enjoy
your one admirable contribution.

43:54.308 --> 43:55.308
Thank you.

44:15.725 --> 44:17.725
Which way do we go?

44:20.184 --> 44:22.600
I need to do this alone.

44:22.683 --> 44:25.017
I'm not leaving your side.

44:25.100 --> 44:27.184
I know this place.

44:29.142 --> 44:31.308
It was my home.

44:33.642 --> 44:35.725
You can wait for me here.

44:37.516 --> 44:39.975
But let me bring her back.

45:39.850 --> 45:42.767
I'm gonna bleed you both
like goats if you don't
shut the fuck up.

45:50.433 --> 45:51.642
Ride! Yah!

47:42.892 --> 47:44.558
Hello there.

47:58.892 --> 48:00.142
What's her name?

48:00.225 --> 48:01.808
Anna.

48:01.892 --> 48:04.558
Is this her sister?

48:04.642 --> 48:06.184
That's her mommy.

48:06.266 --> 48:07.600
Oh.

48:09.433 --> 48:13.225
Oh, I bet she loves Anna
so much.

48:13.308 --> 48:16.391
She doesn't want Anna
to get taken away again.

48:19.017 --> 48:21.266
Who would take her away?

48:24.308 --> 48:26.683
The bad man.

48:26.767 --> 48:28.142
No.

48:30.642 --> 48:33.683
You see...

48:33.767 --> 48:35.850
Anna'a mother...

48:35.934 --> 48:38.433
is very, very  strong.

48:40.391 --> 48:43.184
And she would never, ever...

48:43.266 --> 48:45.975
let anything like that
happen again.

48:51.225 --> 48:53.767
- Mama!

48:58.975 --> 49:00.975
Can I help you?

49:12.100 --> 49:15.100
( horses whinny
in distance )

49:24.142 --> 49:25.975
No.

49:33.683 --> 49:34.683
No. Run!

49:49.017 --> 49:50.142
Mama!

49:53.142 --> 49:54.475
Mama!

49:57.850 --> 49:58.892
Mama!

50:51.558 --> 50:53.100
We have to help them.

50:54.558 --> 50:57.475
What the fuck
are you doing?

50:57.558 --> 50:59.017
I'm calling for help.

50:59.100 --> 51:01.975
For who?

51:02.059 --> 51:04.225
For those of us
who are tired

51:04.308 --> 51:07.059
of having arrows shot at their
predominantly mortal heads.

51:14.308 --> 51:16.558
You're welcome,
by the way!

51:53.850 --> 51:56.350
One of the last things
my daddy told me was

51:56.433 --> 51:59.350
that I should
run from this place.

52:01.142 --> 52:03.308
You think that's right?

52:05.808 --> 52:08.475
I never thought
I'd want to leave...

52:10.975 --> 52:13.266
but I suppose
you fixed that, too.

52:17.475 --> 52:18.934
We're almost there.

52:23.059 --> 52:24.725
Let's turn 'er loose.

52:51.725 --> 52:54.100
That's the last of my mercy.

52:54.184 --> 52:57.059
Better use it fast.

53:17.184 --> 53:18.308
No. No!

53:18.391 --> 53:19.808
Hey!

53:21.308 --> 53:24.433
Come on! Guys, no!

53:28.558 --> 53:31.308
The problem is,
there isn't a problem.

53:31.391 --> 53:34.142
Brother, that's got to be
the dumbest fuckin' thing
I've ever heard,

53:34.225 --> 53:35.808
and I've been to
three inaugurations.

53:35.892 --> 53:37.433
Diagnostics,
com path checks,

53:37.516 --> 53:38.808
everything we can access
is telling us

53:38.892 --> 53:40.642
that the system
is operating normally--

53:40.725 --> 53:42.475
except it isn't.

53:42.558 --> 53:45.475
I managed to isolate
certain ops and gain control.

53:45.558 --> 53:47.516
We've got elevator monitoring
on most levels--

53:47.600 --> 53:48.934
That's great, Hawking.

53:49.017 --> 53:51.850
Did you shut off
the killer robots?

53:51.934 --> 53:53.184
Well, no. The system--

53:53.266 --> 53:54.516
Goldberg, get in there.

53:54.600 --> 53:56.725
Hack the biometrics,
find me a back door.

53:56.808 --> 53:58.391
Hacking isn't
the issue.

53:58.475 --> 54:00.266
The system won't allow us
to access certain protocols.

54:00.350 --> 54:03.184
- Hale: Systems can be forced.
- Not this one.

54:03.266 --> 54:06.558
Well, Ms. Hale.
You got a little present
for us?

54:06.642 --> 54:08.642
He's in Aux Lab Three,
Behavior.

54:08.725 --> 54:10.934
You left him there.

54:11.017 --> 54:13.433
He's not going anywhere.

54:13.516 --> 54:16.350
- Aux Three. Go!
- Soldier: Yes, sir. Copy that.

54:16.433 --> 54:17.683
Computer:
System restored.

54:17.767 --> 54:20.475
Fuck, yeah!
We got the map back.

54:31.850 --> 54:34.059
What the fuck is that?

54:34.142 --> 54:36.683
It's the train.

55:31.391 --> 55:33.558
