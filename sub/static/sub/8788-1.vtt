01:35.804 --> 01:39.307
There are many stories
about Michael Sullivan.

01:41.852 --> 01:44.812
Some say he was a decent man.

01:47.024 --> 01:50.193
Some say there was no good
in him at all.

01:53.614 --> 01:57.116
But I once spent six weeks
on the road with him...

01:57.284 --> 02:00.870
...in the winter of 1931 .

02:04.750 --> 02:07.335
This is our story.

02:39.326 --> 02:43.079
Thank you, sir. Much obliged.
Man dies in factory accident!

02:43.247 --> 02:46.290
Get your paper here!
Hot off the press, only 5 cents!

03:33.088 --> 03:35.339
Thanks, Mr. Miller.

05:04.054 --> 05:06.681
I'll help you with it later.

05:06.932 --> 05:09.433
You go fetch your father.

05:47.431 --> 05:49.306
Pa?

05:55.397 --> 05:56.856
Dinner's ready.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.234
Thank you.

06:09.453 --> 06:12.413
Bless us, O Lord, for thy gifts
we are about to receive...

06:12.581 --> 06:16.333
...through the bounty of Jesus Christ,
our Lord. Amen.

06:28.180 --> 06:30.681
-Michael?
-Sir?

06:31.141 --> 06:35.603
It's a wake, so I don't want to see
those dice.

06:35.812 --> 06:37.146
No, sir.

07:03.548 --> 07:05.174
Hello.

07:16.728 --> 07:18.646
I don't wanna go.

07:18.814 --> 07:24.860
-Come on, it's all right.
-No. I'm scared.

07:44.923 --> 07:47.716
Ice helps preserve the body.

08:13.201 --> 08:14.410
So...

08:14.578 --> 08:17.997
...who's got a hug
for a lonely old man?

08:20.250 --> 08:22.793
Now then, which is which?
Don't help me.

08:23.253 --> 08:27.006
-Peter and Michael.
-No!

08:27.591 --> 08:30.426
Annie, Mike, good to see you.

08:30.594 --> 08:33.804
-Did you bring the necessary?
-Yes.

08:33.972 --> 08:39.184
If you'll excuse me, I have urgent
business with these young gentlemen.

08:45.108 --> 08:47.484
-Yeah!
-Winner!

08:47.652 --> 08:50.779
Call the cops!
I know hustlers when I see them.

08:50.947 --> 08:54.867
-I don't hustle, old-timer.
-Pay the man.

08:57.454 --> 09:00.456
Upstairs.
Jacket pocket, in my study.

09:00.624 --> 09:02.625
Before I change my mind.

09:27.359 --> 09:31.695
-Hello?
-Hello.

09:31.863 --> 09:35.324
Remind me,
which little Sullivan are you?

09:35.492 --> 09:41.622
-Michael, sir.
-Sir? You don't have to call me sir.

09:41.790 --> 09:44.250
I'm not your pa.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.126
No, Mr. Rooney.

09:46.544 --> 09:48.754
Call me Connor.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.966
No, call me Uncle Connor.

09:57.973 --> 09:59.723
What do you want?

10:00.016 --> 10:02.393
Mr. Rooney sent me to get his jacket.

10:05.480 --> 10:08.065
You come back later, huh?

10:08.233 --> 10:10.025
I'm busy.

10:10.193 --> 10:15.364
Yes.... Sir.

10:27.544 --> 10:30.754
Hello, hello.

10:32.173 --> 10:35.759
I want to welcome all of you
to my home.

10:35.969 --> 10:40.347
It's good to have so many friends
in this house again.

10:40.890 --> 10:44.226
Since Mary died, it's....

10:44.602 --> 10:49.148
Well, it's just been me and my boy
rattling around in these rooms.

10:49.733 --> 10:53.235
I had this speech prepared,
but it would be...

10:53.403 --> 10:56.488
...dishonest of me to say that
I knew Danny well.

10:56.698 --> 11:00.242
But lose one of us, it hurts us all.

11:01.453 --> 11:07.750
I'll tell you what I do remember, though,
and Finn will remember this too...

11:07.917 --> 11:11.045
...and that's Danny
on the high school football team.

11:11.212 --> 11:15.758
A championship game. Down six points,
1 0 seconds left to play...

11:15.925 --> 11:19.762
...four yards to go,
Danny tackles his own quarterback.

11:25.852 --> 11:29.104
Mistakes, you know....
We all make them. God knows.

11:31.274 --> 11:33.942
Let's drink to Danny's honor.

11:34.110 --> 11:38.197
Let's wake him to God and hope that he
gets to heaven...

11:38.365 --> 11:41.492
...at least an hour before
the devil finds out he's dead.

11:41.659 --> 11:44.912
-Amen.
-To Danny!

11:49.542 --> 11:54.880
And now, I would like to ask
a dear and a trusted friend...

11:55.048 --> 11:57.216
...Finn McGovern, to say a few words...

11:57.384 --> 12:00.302
...words that I'll wager
got more poetry than mine.

12:00.470 --> 12:02.388
Get over here.

12:09.813 --> 12:11.980
Thank you, John.

12:15.026 --> 12:18.570
"My brother Danny wasn't wise.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.824
Nor was he gentle.

12:22.200 --> 12:26.870
And with a skinful of liquor in him,
he was a pain in the ass.

12:29.582 --> 12:33.669
But he was loyal and brave.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.339
And he never told a lie.

12:40.260 --> 12:43.053
He'd have enjoyed this party.

12:43.513 --> 12:50.018
Me and the family, we wanna say
thank you to our generous host.

12:50.687 --> 12:53.730
Where would this town be
without Mr. John Rooney?"

12:59.571 --> 13:04.783
I've worked for you
for many years now, John.

13:07.412 --> 13:09.121
Nearly half my life.

13:12.959 --> 13:15.252
And we've never had a disagreement.

13:17.714 --> 13:21.258
I've come to realize
that you rule this town...

13:21.426 --> 13:22.926
...as God rules the earth.

13:24.345 --> 13:30.017
-You give, and you take away--
-Lovely. Lovely speech.

13:54.751 --> 13:59.379
I'm gonna bury my brother.
Then I'm gonna deal with you.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.131
Sure, Finn, sure.

14:01.299 --> 14:04.134
You'll take care of all of us.

14:04.302 --> 14:06.553
Once you get a good night's sleep.

14:12.018 --> 14:14.561
-He all right?
-Yeah, he's fine.

14:14.729 --> 14:16.271
Just too much to drink.

14:16.439 --> 14:18.440
I'll talk to him.

14:18.608 --> 14:20.567
-Take Mike with you.
-No, Pa--

14:20.735 --> 14:23.529
Take Mike with you.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.822
Just talk, nothing more.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.998
Why are you always smiling?

17:27.046 --> 17:31.174
'Cause it's all so fucking hysterical.

17:39.976 --> 17:41.143
Michael.

17:41.310 --> 17:42.352
What?

17:43.604 --> 17:47.441
I had a nightmare.
It was about Mr. Rooney's house.

17:49.610 --> 17:51.486
It's just a house.

17:51.654 --> 17:53.321
A big house.

17:53.489 --> 17:55.532
Go back to sleep.

18:00.913 --> 18:03.665
Is Mr. Rooney rich like the Babe?

18:03.833 --> 18:04.875
Richer.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.502
Are we rich?

18:07.670 --> 18:09.045
No, stupid.

18:13.176 --> 18:15.510
What's papa's job?

18:15.803 --> 18:18.430
He works for Mr. Rooney.

18:19.265 --> 18:21.016
Why?

18:21.809 --> 18:26.521
Well, Papa didn't have a father...

18:26.731 --> 18:28.899
...so Mr. Rooney looked after him.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.401
I know that, but what's his job?

18:36.532 --> 18:39.075
He goes on missions for Mr. Rooney.

18:39.243 --> 18:43.288
They're very dangerous.
That's why he brings his gun.

18:46.709 --> 18:50.003
Sometimes even the president
sends him on missions...

18:50.171 --> 18:53.131
...'cause Papa was a war hero and all.

18:53.883 --> 18:57.552
-You're just making that up.
-I am not.

19:01.516 --> 19:03.934
It's all so fucking hysterical.

19:16.072 --> 19:19.741
Peter, I can't come to your concert
tonight. I'm working.

19:22.245 --> 19:23.286
Working at what?

19:25.331 --> 19:28.250
Putting food on your plate, young man.

19:29.335 --> 19:32.879
All right, boys, come on,
clear the plates.

19:39.095 --> 19:41.263
You're a good lad.

21:07.266 --> 21:10.644
-You want a shot?
-No.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.652
We're just talking to him, right?

21:18.819 --> 21:20.570
Sure.

23:15.019 --> 23:18.021
Don't get me wrong, Finn.
I feel for you. I do.

23:18.397 --> 23:23.443
You can't let a thing like that
give you cause to go mouthing off.

23:23.611 --> 23:26.154
You and my dad,
you go back many years...

23:26.322 --> 23:29.074
...and he is a just man.

23:29.575 --> 23:31.659
So, what do you say?

23:34.205 --> 23:36.331
Come on now, Finn.

23:36.665 --> 23:38.917
Make this easy.

23:43.964 --> 23:46.341
We can't hear you.

23:50.513 --> 23:52.722
-All right.
-Good.

23:53.766 --> 23:55.767
Thank you.

23:56.352 --> 24:01.481
I am sorry. I'm sorry for your loss.
I'm sorry for this misunderstanding.

24:01.649 --> 24:04.567
And I'm sorry your brother was
such a fucking liar.

24:04.777 --> 24:08.321
-My brother was not a liar.
-Excuse me?

24:08.531 --> 24:11.407
To protect my family and keep my job,
I'll stay quiet.

24:11.575 --> 24:14.369
But don't think I don't know
something's going on.

24:14.537 --> 24:17.789
-Don't think I won't find out what it is.
-Whoa, buddy--

24:17.957 --> 24:18.998
Easy, easy.

24:19.166 --> 24:20.208
Easy.

24:20.376 --> 24:25.130
We're just talking. You tell your father
my brother never stole from him.

24:25.297 --> 24:31.219
I've checked the books. He never sold
booze to no one. lt's all accounted for.

24:31.387 --> 24:34.180
-If he sold it, where's the money?
-Fuck should I know?

24:34.348 --> 24:37.267
-Did you check his mattress?
-Maybe you should check yours.

24:37.434 --> 24:40.061
There's something immoral here,
don't you think, Mike?

24:40.229 --> 24:43.773
My beloved father throws your
undeserving little brother...

24:43.941 --> 24:47.610
...the wake of his life, and this--
This is your thank-you?

24:47.778 --> 24:50.613
-What a hideous world this is.
-You think you're so smart.

24:50.781 --> 24:54.576
You think we don't know? You're
spending so much time in Chicago--

25:13.220 --> 25:14.762
What was that?

25:14.930 --> 25:16.097
We're out of here.

25:16.265 --> 25:21.060
Jesus Christ, Connor,
what the hell are you thinking?!

25:37.453 --> 25:39.412
Jesus.

25:40.789 --> 25:42.415
Michael.

25:45.628 --> 25:46.711
Are you hurt?

25:51.258 --> 25:52.675
You saw everything?

25:58.974 --> 26:00.225
Jesus.

26:00.392 --> 26:03.895
You are not to speak of this to anyone.
You understand?

26:04.063 --> 26:06.314
Not to anyone!

26:06.482 --> 26:07.690
Who's this?

26:11.362 --> 26:13.029
It's one of yours?

26:13.822 --> 26:16.157
He must have been hiding in the car.

26:16.825 --> 26:18.576
Well, can he keep a secret?

26:20.996 --> 26:22.455
He's my son.

26:26.669 --> 26:29.963
Well, that's good enough for me.

26:30.130 --> 26:32.215
You take him home.

26:32.383 --> 26:34.592
Think I'll walk.

26:34.927 --> 26:37.512
Perfect night for a stroll.

27:07.584 --> 27:09.836
Does Mama know?

27:13.716 --> 27:17.010
Your mother knows I love Mr. Rooney.

27:17.594 --> 27:19.846
We had nothing.

27:20.014 --> 27:25.351
He gave us a home, a life.
We owe him.

27:28.230 --> 27:35.862
Do you understand?

27:37.364 --> 27:39.157
Yes.

27:42.786 --> 27:44.829
Well, come on inside, then.

28:41.804 --> 28:44.722
Boys, clear your plates, please.

28:44.890 --> 28:46.265
I'll do it later.

28:46.433 --> 28:50.311
-It's time for school now--
-It's only a plate!

29:07.663 --> 29:08.996
What's he doing here?

29:09.164 --> 29:11.249
Michael was hiding in the car...

29:11.417 --> 29:13.626
...when I went out last night.

29:13.794 --> 29:15.294
Jesus, Mike.

29:15.462 --> 29:18.840
I've spoken to him.
It won't happen again.

29:20.801 --> 29:23.386
Mom. Mom!

29:33.021 --> 29:35.398
Just the feller....

29:37.359 --> 29:39.777
Our secret, right?

29:41.530 --> 29:44.323
I'm talking about the dice.

29:45.534 --> 29:50.705
A man of honor always pays his debts.

29:51.373 --> 29:54.167
And keeps his word.

30:02.050 --> 30:04.719
I'm gonna be late for school.

30:30.746 --> 30:33.414
How is Michael? ls he okay?

30:34.082 --> 30:36.667
I've spoken to him.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.252
He understands.

30:39.379 --> 30:41.589
That's tough...

30:41.757 --> 30:46.636
...seeing that for the first time.
Well, you turned out.

30:50.307 --> 30:52.975
You can't protect them forever.

30:53.143 --> 30:56.729
If it wasn't this,
it'd be something else.

30:57.314 --> 30:59.982
Natural law.

31:00.150 --> 31:04.529
Sons are put on this earth
to trouble their fathers.

31:15.290 --> 31:19.043
John's also made it clear that
Finn McGovern's operation...

31:19.211 --> 31:21.170
...will be divided up locally...

31:21.338 --> 31:25.841
...among two territories that John
will select personally.

31:26.510 --> 31:30.137
I'd like to take this moment
to thank Mr. Rance for...

31:30.305 --> 31:34.183
...interrupting a busy travel schedule
to pay us a visit.

31:34.351 --> 31:36.936
Thank you, Jack.

31:37.104 --> 31:40.982
Mr. Rance met with John and me earlier
to make another bid...

31:41.149 --> 31:43.317
...for our involvement in the unions.

31:43.485 --> 31:46.487
And I told Mr. Rance
what I told him before:

31:46.655 --> 31:50.408
What men do after work
is what made us rich.

31:50.576 --> 31:53.411
No need to screw them at work
as well.

31:53.579 --> 31:57.790
-Is there any other business?
-Yes.

31:57.958 --> 32:03.963
Connor, is there something
you would like to say about last night?

32:09.845 --> 32:13.472
I'd like to apologize for what happened.

32:14.891 --> 32:17.351
Especially to you, Pa.

32:17.519 --> 32:21.564
Two wakes in a month....
What can I say?

32:22.608 --> 32:25.651
We lost a good man last night.

32:25.819 --> 32:27.236
You think it's funny?

32:28.697 --> 32:30.906
Try again.

32:33.452 --> 32:34.869
I'd like to apologize--

32:39.666 --> 32:44.420
You would like to apologize?
Try again.

32:58.685 --> 33:00.603
Gentlemen...

33:01.730 --> 33:05.983
...my apologies.

33:13.784 --> 33:17.411
Is everyone clear about bit borrowers?

33:17.746 --> 33:20.706
There have been far too many
debts outstanding.

33:20.874 --> 33:23.709
-Mike....
-Just give me their names.

33:23.877 --> 33:25.461
Tell me who to visit.

33:26.129 --> 33:28.130
Thank you, gentlemen.

33:28.298 --> 33:30.633
Come on upstairs.

34:21.184 --> 34:22.476
Mike.

34:27.149 --> 34:29.734
Dad forgot to give you this.

34:29.900 --> 34:33.654
It's just a reminder for Tony Calvino.
He's light again.

34:34.739 --> 34:36.364
Are you coming?

34:36.533 --> 34:40.286
No, I'm under house arrest for a while.

34:40.536 --> 34:45.166
Look, I'm sorry about last night. I am.

34:45.333 --> 34:49.128
I was.... Yeah.

34:49.504 --> 34:51.630
All right.

35:10.817 --> 35:15.404
-Help you, sir? Or just looking?
-Here to see Tony Calvino.

35:15.572 --> 35:17.948
Yeah, and who are you?

35:20.035 --> 35:21.076
Mike Sullivan.

35:21.453 --> 35:24.038
Yes, sir.

35:26.958 --> 35:28.584
You gonna frisk me?

35:28.752 --> 35:32.338
-Should l?
-It's a good idea.

35:37.552 --> 35:39.678
That's the only one.

35:49.564 --> 35:54.109
I mean, I'm a grown man
and this place is getting to me.

35:54.277 --> 35:57.655
Every night there's trouble.

35:57.823 --> 36:02.409
No one's got no dough,
but all the world's here wasting it.

36:02.577 --> 36:06.038
Always money for frills and twists,
and never money for food.

36:06.206 --> 36:10.084
Sometimes I despair the species,
you know?

36:12.087 --> 36:15.881
Number 12 in the beauty parlor.
Who's the lucky face?

36:16.049 --> 36:22.012
I'm not from here originally, but jobs
ain't hanging off trees, you know.

36:22.180 --> 36:26.517
I'm a boxer by trade.
Nine consecutive titles.

36:26.685 --> 36:28.894
That's a record in South Orange.

36:29.104 --> 36:32.439
I'd make a pretty good bodyguard,
I think.

36:32.816 --> 36:36.402
What I'm saying is,
is Mr. Rooney looking for anyone?

36:36.570 --> 36:42.950
You know, anyone like me, for example?
Is there any chance you might ask him?

36:43.118 --> 36:46.078
-Sure.
-Thank you, Mr. Sullivan.

36:46.246 --> 36:49.081
Thank you very much.
I appreciate it.

36:53.003 --> 36:57.172
Mr. Calvino?
Mr. Calvino, Mike Sullivan's here.

36:57.507 --> 37:00.467
-Shit.
-He wants to see you.

37:00.635 --> 37:05.514
-Shit. ls he packing?
-Not anymore.

37:05.807 --> 37:07.808
All right.

37:08.143 --> 37:09.643
Show him in.

37:09.811 --> 37:14.023
Hey, hey, hey.
You stick around, okay?

37:22.991 --> 37:24.325
Hey!

37:24.492 --> 37:28.621
How the hell are you?
Things good with the old man?

37:28.788 --> 37:29.955
Yeah.

37:30.206 --> 37:34.835
What brings you here?
Don't imagine it's the pussy.

37:36.630 --> 37:41.050
-I have a letter for you from Mr. Rooney.
-Am I behind again?

37:46.765 --> 37:50.643
-Am I in trouble?
-I don't know.

38:51.162 --> 38:52.913
Michael.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.770
No!

41:44.544 --> 41:49.590
No! My God!

42:27.921 --> 42:30.505
-Pa, I'm sorry.
-Stupid!

42:30.798 --> 42:34.176
The kid would've talked. I'm sorry.

42:34.677 --> 42:38.847
Goddamn you. Goddamn you!

42:39.140 --> 42:45.479
I curse the fucking day you were born!

42:45.980 --> 42:48.482
I curse it!

42:51.152 --> 42:52.486
You!

42:59.160 --> 43:01.328
Oh, Lord.

43:04.707 --> 43:09.503
Oh, Lord. God help us.

43:09.754 --> 43:11.713
God help us.

43:23.601 --> 43:27.396
This house is not our home anymore.

43:27.730 --> 43:30.399
It's just an empty building.

43:57.176 --> 44:00.178
All right, you stay here.
You stay out of sight.

44:00.346 --> 44:02.431
-Don't go, Pa. Don't go.
-Michael...

44:02.890 --> 44:06.268
...when they find out we're gone,
they're gonna come after us.

44:06.436 --> 44:08.812
I have to protect you now.

44:09.480 --> 44:11.773
Please, Pa.

44:15.570 --> 44:18.822
All right, here, take this.

44:19.032 --> 44:21.408
-No. I don't want it.
-Take it.

44:21.659 --> 44:26.955
-I don't want it.
-Boy, take it! You got six shots.

44:27.123 --> 44:31.668
If I'm not back in half an hour, go tell
Reverend Lynch what's happened.

44:31.836 --> 44:34.921
Do not go to Father Callaway.

45:05.286 --> 45:07.621
I don't have any business with you,
Mr. Kelly.

45:07.789 --> 45:11.416
But I have business with you, Mike.

45:11.626 --> 45:14.211
Go ahead.

45:16.297 --> 45:18.048
What is that?

45:18.299 --> 45:23.178
25,000 dollars. Mr. Rooney wants you
to know there's more if you need it.

45:23.429 --> 45:28.517
You have friends in lreland, Mike.
Why don't you take Peter and leave?

45:28.768 --> 45:31.478
I can't take Peter.

45:31.687 --> 45:36.149
He's dead.

45:36.317 --> 45:40.445
-So where's Connor?
-He's in hiding.

45:41.072 --> 45:43.865
-Where?
-You know I can't tell you that.

45:45.576 --> 45:49.621
You think sticking a gun to my head
is gonna make any difference to me?

45:49.831 --> 45:55.669
If I tell you, I'm a dead man anyway.
We both are.

45:55.837 --> 46:02.342
Think, Mike. Don't be stupid.
I'm just the messenger.

46:12.186 --> 46:15.856
Then give Mr. Rooney a message for me.

46:16.023 --> 46:17.774
What is it?

46:32.874 --> 46:34.708
Give me the gun.

46:47.305 --> 46:49.723
Where are we going?

46:49.891 --> 46:51.683
To Chicago.

46:52.185 --> 46:54.769
There's a man there who runs things.

46:55.646 --> 46:57.939
I've done some work for him.

46:58.649 --> 47:01.485
We have to find out where he stands.

47:04.197 --> 47:06.490
Try to get some sleep.

48:44.714 --> 48:46.840
I want you to wait for me here.

48:47.091 --> 48:50.135
-Sure.
-I won't be long. You'll be all right?

48:50.386 --> 48:54.264
-Yeah, I'll be all right.
-That's a good boy.

49:42.355 --> 49:45.482
-Hello, Mike.
-Hello, fellas.

49:45.650 --> 49:51.780
It's nice to see you. We heard what
happened. How you holding up?

49:51.989 --> 49:54.324
I need to talk to Mr. Nitti.

49:55.242 --> 49:59.079
-He's awful busy.
-I can wait.

49:59.997 --> 50:03.083
Okay. Take the man to the top.

51:00.391 --> 51:02.308
Certainly, sir.

51:09.650 --> 51:13.236
Sorry to make you wait so long, Mike.
Come on in.

51:13.404 --> 51:16.865
We all just heard what happened.

51:17.032 --> 51:20.034
Jesus, I'm sorry, Mike.

51:20.202 --> 51:25.665
Well, thank you for seeing me,
Mr. Nitti.

51:25.833 --> 51:27.500
Come on, sit down.

51:27.793 --> 51:29.169
-Like some coffee or...?
-No.

51:29.336 --> 51:31.921
-You sure?
-Yes, thank you.

51:33.591 --> 51:40.013
So, what can I do for you, Mike?

51:40.264 --> 51:42.474
I'd like to work for you.

51:46.061 --> 51:49.856
Well, that's very interesting.

51:50.149 --> 51:55.862
And in return, I'd like you to turn a
blind eye to what I have to do.

51:56.197 --> 51:57.781
And what is that?

52:00.826 --> 52:03.328
Kill the man who murdered my family.

52:04.205 --> 52:06.581
Is one more body
gonna make a difference?

52:08.000 --> 52:10.710
This is a good proposal, Mr. Nitti.

52:10.920 --> 52:14.714
I will work only for you,
and you know I can do a good job.

52:16.926 --> 52:19.385
I respect you, Mike. I do.

52:19.720 --> 52:24.891
We would like nothing more than to have
you come work for us. But not like this.

52:25.059 --> 52:28.061
What you're asking me is impossible.

52:28.354 --> 52:29.854
Is it?

52:32.107 --> 52:37.403
Let me explain something to you that
maybe you haven't realized.

52:38.572 --> 52:42.325
All these years, you've been living
under the protection...

52:42.493 --> 52:44.744
...of people who care about you.

52:44.912 --> 52:51.292
And those same people
are protecting you now, including me.

52:51.544 --> 52:56.506
So if you go ahead with this,
if you open that door...

52:56.674 --> 52:58.842
...you're walking through it alone.

52:59.593 --> 53:06.057
And all that loyalty, all that trust,
will no longer exist for you.

53:08.269 --> 53:14.399
And Mike, you won't make it.
Not on your own.

53:15.609 --> 53:18.319
And not with a little boy.

53:22.616 --> 53:25.201
You're protecting him already?

53:27.746 --> 53:30.331
We're protecting our interests, Mike.

53:32.501 --> 53:35.128
I drove all through the night
to see you.

53:35.963 --> 53:41.092
I appreciate that.
Now I suggest you drive yourself back.

53:46.765 --> 53:51.352
Go home, Mike.
Go home and bury your wife and child.

53:51.520 --> 53:53.479
With our blessing.

53:56.859 --> 53:59.277
It won't be that simple.

54:36.774 --> 54:39.609
You heard?

54:39.777 --> 54:43.863
Dad, listen to me.
He's in the building.

54:44.031 --> 54:49.869
-You can end this now. Take him now.
-Connor, get upstairs.

54:58.921 --> 55:02.048
God help me.

55:02.216 --> 55:07.178
God help me. What do I do?

55:07.388 --> 55:11.182
You think objectively.

55:11.350 --> 55:13.601
And you make your choice.

55:16.105 --> 55:20.066
What would you do if Sullivan
were just some guy?

55:22.987 --> 55:26.864
God help me.

55:27.032 --> 55:29.492
-Make it quick.
-And the kid?

55:30.786 --> 55:33.579
Oh, Christ. No, no.

55:34.623 --> 55:39.502
One day the kid becomes a man....
Think he won't remember?

55:40.921 --> 55:43.589
I said not the kid.

55:44.591 --> 55:47.051
All right.

55:47.219 --> 55:48.970
I know who to call.

55:50.472 --> 55:54.684
There's a guy who's done some work
for us in the past.

55:54.852 --> 55:56.644
He's gifted.

56:09.283 --> 56:13.244
Excuse me, ma'am. Press. Press.

56:13.454 --> 56:15.955
He was raping my wife.
He raped my wife.

56:16.123 --> 56:19.625
Come on, come on,
you're treading on the evidence here.

56:27.134 --> 56:30.511
Two minutes.

56:30.679 --> 56:32.889
You got it, Mr. Maguire.

57:56.974 --> 58:00.685
Harlen Maguire.
Good evening, Mr. Nitti.

58:04.439 --> 58:06.816
Sixteen hundred.

58:07.609 --> 58:10.153
Sixteen hundred dollars is my rate,
Mr. Nitti.

58:10.404 --> 58:13.406
And what I make on
the photographs is mine.

58:16.493 --> 58:18.077
No, never met him.

58:18.245 --> 58:19.620
But I know his work.

58:26.253 --> 58:28.629
He traveling alone?

58:31.008 --> 58:32.842
How old?

58:38.390 --> 58:40.683
What do I do with the kid?

58:47.900 --> 58:49.692
Will do.

58:50.861 --> 58:52.737
Thank you.

58:59.077 --> 59:03.748
You remember your aunt Sarah?
Your mom's sister?

59:05.876 --> 59:09.879
She lives in Perdition.
She'll take you in.

59:11.924 --> 59:13.799
Where is it?

59:14.051 --> 59:16.260
Right by the lake.

59:17.763 --> 59:22.516
We went there once, all of us,
when you were 4, maybe 5.

59:24.603 --> 59:26.479
It's beautiful.

59:27.856 --> 59:29.899
You remember?

59:33.403 --> 59:35.738
The place with the dog.

01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:39.570
-Hello?
-Sarah.

01:01:39.738 --> 01:01:41.489
Mike. Oh, thank God.

01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:43.908
I want you to know we're okay.

01:01:44.076 --> 01:01:45.659
Where are you?

01:01:45.827 --> 01:01:48.704
We're on our way to your place,
if that's all right.

01:01:49.039 --> 01:01:52.291
Of course.
I'll be back there in two days.

01:01:52.459 --> 01:01:53.542
How's Michael?

01:01:53.877 --> 01:01:55.920
He's all right.

01:01:58.882 --> 01:02:00.841
How was it?

01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:04.345
Oh, Mike....

01:02:08.767 --> 01:02:10.851
Hello?

01:02:15.065 --> 01:02:17.608
We'll see you soon.

01:02:38.255 --> 01:02:41.048
-Hello, operator?
-Yes, sir.

01:02:41.216 --> 01:02:44.301
I was just cut off,
could you reconnect me?

01:03:52.204 --> 01:03:54.622
You hungry?

01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:56.582
No.

01:03:57.667 --> 01:04:01.128
Might not be another diner for a while,
so you should eat.

01:04:01.296 --> 01:04:02.922
I'm not hungry.

01:04:03.089 --> 01:04:05.674
I just wanna read.

01:05:48.862 --> 01:05:52.323
-Slow night, huh?
-You kidding? This is busy.

01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:55.618
-What can I get you?
-You got a special?

01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:57.453
Everything's special.

01:05:58.330 --> 01:06:01.832
-Is that so?
-Everything except the food.

01:06:02.417 --> 01:06:04.710
Everything except the food?

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:09.757
-You ought to be on the stage.
-Don't I know it.

01:06:09.924 --> 01:06:14.553
Give me some of that honey-dipped
fried chicken and a black coffee.

01:06:14.721 --> 01:06:16.847
Duck soup.

01:06:26.775 --> 01:06:29.068
Don't mind me, sir.

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:34.156
It's a free country.
Used to be, anyhow.

01:06:37.535 --> 01:06:39.203
No, thank you, sir.

01:06:49.839 --> 01:06:55.552
Is that your profession
or your pleasure?

01:06:55.762 --> 01:06:58.639
Both, I guess.

01:06:59.182 --> 01:07:03.352
To be paid to do what you love....
Ain't that the dream?

01:07:07.982 --> 01:07:09.650
I guess so.

01:07:10.694 --> 01:07:11.860
Yourself?

01:07:12.195 --> 01:07:14.822
I'm a salesman.
Machine parts.

01:07:16.533 --> 01:07:19.201
Machine parts.

01:07:19.661 --> 01:07:23.706
-That's wonderful.
-I assure you, it is not.

01:07:24.708 --> 01:07:28.752
-So who do you work for?
-Can you keep a secret?

01:07:30.422 --> 01:07:32.089
I'm press.

01:07:32.757 --> 01:07:34.925
Which paper?

01:07:35.885 --> 01:07:39.638
All over.
I'm something of a rarity.

01:07:41.099 --> 01:07:42.141
How's that?

01:07:42.726 --> 01:07:44.351
I shoot the dead.

01:07:48.606 --> 01:07:51.817
Dead bodies, that is.
I don't kill them.

01:07:55.196 --> 01:07:57.489
I should hope not.

01:07:58.825 --> 01:08:04.705
Always fascinated me,
the look of them, you know?

01:08:05.248 --> 01:08:09.793
-You ever seen one?
-Yeah.

01:08:09.961 --> 01:08:12.045
Sorry for you.

01:08:12.255 --> 01:08:14.465
Terrible thing.

01:08:14.883 --> 01:08:18.260
But it sure makes you feel alive,
don't it?

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:26.350
I'll drink to that.

01:08:27.145 --> 01:08:29.188
Stuff makes you sweat, huh?

01:08:32.442 --> 01:08:33.734
Yeah, piss too.

01:08:33.902 --> 01:08:37.196
Excuse me, ma'am,
can you help me out here?

01:08:37.447 --> 01:08:39.448
Just through here.

01:08:40.908 --> 01:08:42.785
Hey!

01:08:43.787 --> 01:08:45.078
Look out, there.

01:09:02.889 --> 01:09:05.933
-Thanks, Ruby.
-Good night.

01:09:23.201 --> 01:09:25.118
Forgot to leave a tip.

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:40.175
-Get down.
-Why? What's going on?

01:09:40.343 --> 01:09:41.760
Get down!

01:09:43.095 --> 01:09:45.889
Hey, what do you think you're--?

01:10:09.455 --> 01:10:11.582
Get out of the car.

01:10:11.958 --> 01:10:15.419
Get out of the car!
When I say get down, you get down.

01:10:15.587 --> 01:10:18.672
Don't ask questions. When I say we're
stopping to eat, you stay with me.

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:22.050
You listen to me from now on,
or you start taking care of yourself.

01:10:22.302 --> 01:10:26.096
I can take care of myself fine!
You never wanted me along anyway.

01:10:26.306 --> 01:10:29.141
-You think it's my fault this happened.
-Stop it.

01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:30.767
It was not your fault!

01:10:34.397 --> 01:10:37.149
None of this is your fault.

01:10:38.568 --> 01:10:42.654
-Just take me to Aunt Sarah's.
-I can't take you there.

01:10:43.239 --> 01:10:44.656
Not now.

01:10:44.908 --> 01:10:50.078
-Why?
-He knows that's where we're going.

01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:53.624
So, what are you gonna do?

01:10:56.461 --> 01:10:59.254
Something I can't do alone.

01:11:00.715 --> 01:11:05.344
You have to listen to me now, okay?

01:11:05.553 --> 01:11:08.305
Or else both of us are dead.

01:11:09.515 --> 01:11:12.267
I have to make Capone give up Connor.

01:11:12.435 --> 01:11:15.812
There's one thing Chicago loves
more than anything...

01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:17.606
...and that's their money.

01:11:17.774 --> 01:11:23.153
They've got it in banks all over the
state. We have to find it and take it.

01:11:24.989 --> 01:11:28.867
-Are you gonna help me?
-Yes.

01:11:30.912 --> 01:11:33.747
Then I have to teach you something.

01:11:35.625 --> 01:11:39.294
-You know what the clutch is?
-Sure I know what the clutch is.

01:11:39.462 --> 01:11:42.464
-What is the clutch?
-The clutch, it.... It clutches.

01:11:42.632 --> 01:11:46.259
Right, it clutches.
Which of those pedals is the clutch?

01:11:46.803 --> 01:11:48.428
That's the gas.

01:11:48.805 --> 01:11:51.431
Gas. I'll show you.

01:11:51.599 --> 01:11:53.141
There. Right there, see?

01:11:53.309 --> 01:11:56.311
There's the clutch,
and it does the clutching.

01:12:02.652 --> 01:12:04.695
Let's go again.

01:12:13.746 --> 01:12:20.002
Release gas, clutch,
shift gear, hit gas....

01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:21.211
Shift.

01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:32.764
-Can I make one suggestion?
-No.

01:12:32.932 --> 01:12:35.225
I'm doing this.

01:12:46.237 --> 01:12:49.072
Hey, 45 miles an hour,
that's a little fast.

01:12:49.741 --> 01:12:51.950
Look out for the tractor, Mike.

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:54.786
Michael, look out for the tractor.

01:12:55.246 --> 01:12:58.999
Watch out for the tractor.
Watch out for the tractor!

01:13:01.544 --> 01:13:05.589
-We made it.
-Oh, yeah, yeah, we made it.

01:13:18.686 --> 01:13:22.647
No more excuses. I've told you once,
now I'm telling you again--

01:13:22.815 --> 01:13:25.734
-I'm looking for a Mr. McDougal.
-Just one moment.

01:13:26.152 --> 01:13:28.737
Well, this is a pleasant surprise.

01:13:28.905 --> 01:13:31.990
I wasn't expecting another
deposit until the end of the month.

01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:35.994
Actually, I'm making a withdrawal.
I want dirty money only.

01:13:36.204 --> 01:13:40.999
Everything you're holding for Capone
that's off the books. Open the safe.

01:13:42.752 --> 01:13:46.254
You're insane.
You know they'll find out who you are.

01:13:46.422 --> 01:13:49.341
The name's Sullivan.
You want me to spell it?

01:13:52.261 --> 01:13:53.470
Open the box.

01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:56.389
They'll kill you. They're animals.

01:13:56.599 --> 01:14:00.143
You don't say. Put it in.

01:14:05.066 --> 01:14:06.149
That's for you.

01:14:06.484 --> 01:14:09.611
Call it a handling charge.
Tell Chicago I took it.

01:14:10.113 --> 01:14:15.242
But if I read about this in the papers,
if I read about the savings of farmers...

01:14:15.409 --> 01:14:19.830
...being wiped out by a heartless
bank robber, I won't be happy.

01:14:21.374 --> 01:14:23.625
Good afternoon.

01:14:23.793 --> 01:14:26.128
You really trust me not to say
anything?

01:14:26.295 --> 01:14:28.213
Always trust a bank manager.

01:14:44.188 --> 01:14:46.606
There's no rush.

01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:02.557
-Coffee?
-Thank you.

01:16:08.481 --> 01:16:12.108
So, what brings you guys
to the middle of nowhere?

01:16:12.276 --> 01:16:14.444
We're bank robbers.

01:16:15.571 --> 01:16:17.781
We're just passing through.

01:16:24.163 --> 01:16:27.165
So when do I get my share
of the money?

01:16:30.253 --> 01:16:35.298
Well, how much do you want?

01:16:37.593 --> 01:16:39.970
Two hundred dollars.

01:16:42.014 --> 01:16:44.683
Okay. Deal.

01:16:54.527 --> 01:16:58.280
-Could I have had more?
-You'll never know.

01:17:11.419 --> 01:17:14.462
Come on, come on.

01:17:30.688 --> 01:17:32.981
How much did they take?

01:17:33.149 --> 01:17:34.607
How much?

01:17:34.775 --> 01:17:38.403
Okay, answer me this:
What are we paying you for?

01:17:38.571 --> 01:17:40.363
-Where's my father?
-What's this?

01:17:40.614 --> 01:17:44.784
Why is no one talking to me?
I feel like a fucking prisoner.

01:17:45.244 --> 01:17:48.997
I told you. You are not a prisoner.
You are being protected.

01:17:49.165 --> 01:17:52.375
-This is what your father wants.
-I can look after myself.

01:17:52.585 --> 01:17:55.045
No, you can't. This is the point.

01:17:55.212 --> 01:17:58.965
You're a big baby who doesn't know
his thumb from his dick.

01:17:59.133 --> 01:18:00.175
Fuck you.

01:18:00.593 --> 01:18:05.347
The only reason you're still alive
is because you're John Rooney's son.

01:18:05.514 --> 01:18:08.850
You're being a little
shortsighted here, Frank.

01:18:09.018 --> 01:18:11.811
My father is an old man.

01:18:12.313 --> 01:18:14.647
I am the future.

01:18:15.524 --> 01:18:18.651
So don't you ever talk to me
that way again.

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:35.877
Maguire, do what you have to.
Find them.

01:18:36.712 --> 01:18:40.507
I'm sorry, Mr. Sullivan,
there is no money.

01:18:40.966 --> 01:18:44.803
No-- I can get you money, I just--

01:18:44.970 --> 01:18:46.388
It won't be Chicago's.

01:18:46.555 --> 01:18:49.474
They took it all out two days ago.

01:18:54.188 --> 01:18:56.773
-Who authorized it?
-The accountant.

01:18:57.733 --> 01:18:59.526
What's his name?

01:18:59.777 --> 01:19:02.153
This is Mr. Rance in the bridal suite.

01:19:02.321 --> 01:19:06.741
Before you proffer your congratulations,
there's no Mrs. Rance with me...

01:19:06.909 --> 01:19:10.286
...and I'm all the better for it.
Listen carefully...

01:19:10.454 --> 01:19:13.039
...because I am in no mood.

01:19:13.207 --> 01:19:15.333
I'm going to say this only once.

01:19:15.501 --> 01:19:19.462
I would like a boiled egg,
and I want it runny.

01:19:20.756 --> 01:19:24.509
Pa, can we sleep in a motel room
tonight instead of the car?

01:19:24.677 --> 01:19:26.886
Yeah, that would be nice.

01:19:36.689 --> 01:19:39.816
How many more days
you gonna want me, mister?

01:19:40.067 --> 01:19:43.903
Can't we close the curtains,
even for a little while?

01:19:44.071 --> 01:19:47.699
I can't get no sleep
with all that light.

01:19:48.826 --> 01:19:51.536
You see anything,
you hit that horn twice.

01:19:51.704 --> 01:19:54.247
Don't get out of the car,
no matter what.

01:20:04.341 --> 01:20:05.467
Bye.

01:20:11.348 --> 01:20:15.059
-Ready?
-I'm ready.

01:20:29.116 --> 01:20:32.494
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

01:20:32.745 --> 01:20:34.245
Runny.

01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:52.222
It's open.

01:20:53.599 --> 01:20:58.561
Top marks for speed,
no marks for cookery.

01:20:58.729 --> 01:21:02.398
What, may I ask, do you call this?

01:21:02.608 --> 01:21:03.858
Put it down.

01:21:04.026 --> 01:21:07.362
-Mr. Sullivan.
-Mr. Rance.

01:21:07.530 --> 01:21:09.197
How did you find me?

01:21:09.365 --> 01:21:14.410
This is the best hotel in the area.
And you are so very...particular.

01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:16.746
Yes, indeed, Mr. Sullivan.

01:21:16.956 --> 01:21:20.583
May I ask you to lower your weapon.

01:21:21.544 --> 01:21:23.795
Thank you.
Now, what do you want?

01:21:23.963 --> 01:21:25.171
Information.

01:21:32.012 --> 01:21:35.098
I can't give you the files.

01:21:35.266 --> 01:21:37.016
All right, all right.

01:21:37.184 --> 01:21:40.311
They're in the next room.

01:21:46.735 --> 01:21:49.612
-In here.
-Bring it in.

01:21:57.913 --> 01:21:59.080
I can't see.

01:22:02.543 --> 01:22:06.588
What will you accomplish by
interfering with our business?

01:22:06.755 --> 01:22:11.092
-This has nothing to do with business.
-It's all business. You fail to grasp that.

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:14.012
And in business, you must
have something to trade.

01:22:14.179 --> 01:22:16.598
And you, Mr. Sullivan,
have nothing to trade.

01:22:16.765 --> 01:22:20.602
Especially not for anyone
as valuable as Connor Rooney.

01:22:20.769 --> 01:22:22.186
I don't understand.

01:22:23.230 --> 01:22:25.106
Opening bell on Wall Street.

01:22:27.860 --> 01:22:29.360
Come on, open it.

01:22:31.697 --> 01:22:33.823
Which one is it?

01:22:53.469 --> 01:22:56.554
No, no, not it.

01:22:58.515 --> 01:23:01.142
Tried that one already.

01:23:02.311 --> 01:23:04.270
Better start over.

01:23:04.605 --> 01:23:06.230
You got one more try.

01:23:09.485 --> 01:23:12.153
There it is.

01:24:28.105 --> 01:24:29.814
I'm okay. Watch the road!

01:24:51.587 --> 01:24:54.714
Pa! Pa, are you okay?

01:24:56.467 --> 01:24:59.635
Pa!

01:25:12.608 --> 01:25:13.941
Help!

01:25:14.109 --> 01:25:15.193
Help us!

01:25:16.069 --> 01:25:20.573
Help!

01:25:20.741 --> 01:25:22.158
Help us!

01:26:12.084 --> 01:26:14.544
When are you two heading out?

01:26:17.881 --> 01:26:20.466
We've stayed long enough.

01:26:20.968 --> 01:26:23.594
We don't wanna cause you any trouble.

01:26:25.722 --> 01:26:28.224
No trouble so far.

01:26:31.895 --> 01:26:34.355
He's a good worker.

01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:38.067
You have any kids?

01:26:38.235 --> 01:26:40.027
No.

01:26:40.362 --> 01:26:42.697
We met too late.

01:26:46.076 --> 01:26:48.619
He dotes on you.

01:26:53.709 --> 01:26:55.251
You don't see it.

01:27:27.618 --> 01:27:29.827
Hello.

01:27:30.913 --> 01:27:32.788
I had a bad dream.

01:27:34.082 --> 01:27:35.833
You wanna talk about it?

01:27:38.545 --> 01:27:41.380
Well, come on in. Take a seat...

01:27:41.548 --> 01:27:43.674
...if you want.

01:27:56.772 --> 01:27:57.939
Math, huh?

01:27:58.106 --> 01:27:59.899
Yeah.

01:28:00.067 --> 01:28:01.943
I always hated it.

01:28:02.110 --> 01:28:04.153
Me too.

01:28:10.285 --> 01:28:12.286
So, what do you like?

01:28:12.454 --> 01:28:15.081
Huh?

01:28:15.248 --> 01:28:20.044
What subjects do you like--?
Did you like...in school?

01:28:22.798 --> 01:28:24.840
Bible history, maybe.

01:28:26.802 --> 01:28:27.885
Why?

01:28:29.012 --> 01:28:31.013
I like the stories.

01:28:33.475 --> 01:28:35.935
Peter was good at math.

01:28:38.772 --> 01:28:40.898
Was he?

01:28:50.158 --> 01:28:52.368
Did you like Peter more than me?

01:28:55.539 --> 01:28:57.498
No.

01:28:59.501 --> 01:29:02.003
No, Michael.

01:29:03.797 --> 01:29:06.424
I loved you both the same.

01:29:08.010 --> 01:29:10.261
But you were....

01:29:11.930 --> 01:29:15.016
You were different with me.

01:29:15.726 --> 01:29:17.768
Was l?

01:29:28.864 --> 01:29:30.740
Well....

01:29:32.534 --> 01:29:37.246
Maybe it was because Peter was just
such a sweet boy, you know?

01:29:40.876 --> 01:29:42.877
And you....

01:29:46.048 --> 01:29:48.674
You were more like me.

01:29:50.635 --> 01:29:55.431
And I didn't want you to be.

01:29:59.144 --> 01:30:04.732
I didn't mean to be...different.

01:30:09.404 --> 01:30:10.780
Okay.

01:30:21.958 --> 01:30:23.417
Good night, Pa.

01:30:23.919 --> 01:30:25.711
Good night.

01:31:34.656 --> 01:31:38.951
Michael, wake up.
Get your things.

01:31:39.828 --> 01:31:40.995
We're leaving.

01:31:43.415 --> 01:31:44.832
We left you something.

01:32:54.027 --> 01:32:56.070
Hello, John.

01:33:04.579 --> 01:33:07.665
You're a smart man, Michael.

01:33:09.876 --> 01:33:12.086
I wanna talk.

01:33:12.712 --> 01:33:14.546
Here?

01:33:15.465 --> 01:33:16.799
Downstairs.

01:33:44.995 --> 01:33:47.121
I didn't think I'd see you again.

01:33:50.125 --> 01:33:51.333
Read this.

01:33:52.002 --> 01:33:55.254
Connor's been stealing from you
for years.

01:33:55.630 --> 01:34:01.051
He keeps accounts open under the names
of dead men. Men like the McGoverns.

01:34:02.804 --> 01:34:06.473
I stood there and helped him
kill Finn to line his own pockets.

01:34:06.641 --> 01:34:10.436
I thought I was working for you,
but I wasn't.

01:34:10.603 --> 01:34:12.563
You think I'd give up my son?

01:34:12.731 --> 01:34:14.773
He was betraying you.

01:34:15.275 --> 01:34:17.484
I know.

01:34:17.652 --> 01:34:19.611
Now, listen to me.

01:34:19.946 --> 01:34:23.949
I tried to avoid more bloodshed.
You wouldn't accept that...

01:34:24.117 --> 01:34:28.329
...so I did what was necessary.
But I've always loved you like a son.

01:34:28.496 --> 01:34:33.125
And now I'm telling you,
leave before it's too late.

01:34:33.501 --> 01:34:37.421
Think.

01:34:37.589 --> 01:34:42.051
They're protecting him now, but when
you're gone, they won't need him.

01:34:42.218 --> 01:34:46.597
-This ends with Connor dead regardless.
-That may be...

01:34:47.098 --> 01:34:50.017
...but you are asking me...

01:34:50.185 --> 01:34:53.687
...to give you the key to his room
so you can walk in...

01:34:53.855 --> 01:34:57.358
...put a gun to his head
and pull the trigger. I can't do that.

01:34:57.525 --> 01:35:02.279
-He murdered Annie and Peter.
-There are only murderers in this room.

01:35:02.447 --> 01:35:05.824
Michael, open your eyes.

01:35:06.534 --> 01:35:10.037
This is the life we chose,
the life we lead.

01:35:10.205 --> 01:35:16.668
And there is only one guarantee:
None of us will see heaven.

01:35:16.878 --> 01:35:19.088
Michael could.

01:35:19.255 --> 01:35:25.386
Then do everything that you can
to see that that happens.

01:35:25.553 --> 01:35:29.139
Leave.
I'm begging you.

01:35:29.933 --> 01:35:32.101
It's the only way.

01:35:34.938 --> 01:35:36.480
And if I go?

01:35:37.857 --> 01:35:39.817
Then...

01:35:39.984 --> 01:35:42.778
...I will mourn...

01:35:43.905 --> 01:35:45.781
...the son I lost.

01:36:44.632 --> 01:36:46.133
What are you gonna do?

01:36:47.302 --> 01:36:51.096
Just one last thing,
and then it's done.

01:36:56.978 --> 01:36:59.188
Go back to bed, Michael.

01:40:17.762 --> 01:40:20.055
I'm glad it's you.

01:41:35.715 --> 01:41:37.382
I understand.

01:41:37.550 --> 01:41:43.138
But then Al wants your assurance
that after that, it's over.

01:41:46.809 --> 01:41:51.897
The Lexington Hotel, room 1432.

01:45:23.651 --> 01:45:25.568
Is that the house?

01:45:26.404 --> 01:45:27.988
That's it.

01:45:30.866 --> 01:45:33.118
I knew there was a dog.

01:46:16.829 --> 01:46:22.125
Sarah? lt's me, Mike.
We're here.

01:47:54.176 --> 01:47:55.802
Smile.

01:48:22.621 --> 01:48:24.247
Give me the gun.

01:48:24.790 --> 01:48:25.874
Michael.

01:48:29.628 --> 01:48:30.795
Michael...

01:48:31.714 --> 01:48:33.798
...don't you do this.

01:48:34.842 --> 01:48:36.593
Give me the gun, Michael.

01:48:40.556 --> 01:48:42.015
Come on.

01:48:42.766 --> 01:48:44.851
Give me the gun.

01:48:59.533 --> 01:49:01.326
I couldn't do it.

01:49:03.829 --> 01:49:05.705
I know.

01:49:13.172 --> 01:49:16.466
-Pa.
-I'm sorry.

01:49:16.634 --> 01:49:19.552
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:49:24.683 --> 01:49:26.392
I'm sorry.

01:49:32.399 --> 01:49:33.733
Pa.

01:49:35.069 --> 01:49:39.197
Pa!

01:49:48.540 --> 01:49:50.041
Pa.

01:49:51.502 --> 01:49:55.088
Pa! Pa!

01:50:44.179 --> 01:50:48.433
I saw then
that my father's only fear...

01:50:48.684 --> 01:50:52.020
...was that his son
would follow the same road.

01:50:54.231 --> 01:50:57.483
And that was the last time
I ever held a gun.

01:51:27.639 --> 01:51:31.225
People always thought
I grew up on a farm.

01:51:31.393 --> 01:51:37.231
And I guess, in a way, I did.

01:51:39.902 --> 01:51:42.695
But I lived a lifetime before that...

01:51:42.863 --> 01:51:45.698
...in those six weeks on the road...

01:51:45.866 --> 01:51:48.701
...in the winter of 1931 .

01:51:58.462 --> 01:52:02.548
When people ask me if Michael Sullivan
was a good man...

01:52:03.133 --> 01:52:06.552
...or if there was just no good
in him at all...

01:52:07.388 --> 01:52:09.889
...I always give the same answer.

01:52:12.434 --> 01:52:14.852
I just tell them...

01:52:16.271 --> 01:52:18.731
..."He was my father."
