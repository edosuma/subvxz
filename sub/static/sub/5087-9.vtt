00:09.133 --> 00:10.333
(Forrest)
Previously on Review...

00:10.333 --> 00:12.100
What would it be like
to kill a person?

00:12.100 --> 00:13.100
(man)
Is he gonna do it?

00:13.100 --> 00:15.300
We have told him
not to do it.

00:15.300 --> 00:17.300
[gunshot]
(Forrest) Ohh...

00:21.267 --> 00:23.900
Life--it's literally
all we have.

00:23.900 --> 00:25.433
But is it any good?

00:25.433 --> 00:27.267
I'm a reviewer,
but I don't review

00:27.267 --> 00:28.933
food, books, or movies.

00:28.933 --> 00:31.000
I review life itself.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.600
[screams]

00:32.600 --> 00:34.533
[triumphant music]

00:34.533 --> 00:36.233
[parrot squawks]

00:36.233 --> 00:39.767
*

00:39.767 --> 00:41.067
Over here.

00:41.067 --> 00:45.133
*

00:48.133 --> 00:50.633
- Forrest.
- Hmm? Oh.

00:50.633 --> 00:52.133
Yes.

00:52.133 --> 00:53.533
Hello.

00:53.533 --> 00:55.667
How's it going, Forrest?

00:55.667 --> 00:57.667
Pretty bad.

00:57.667 --> 01:00.400
Ever since our
last episode, I...

01:00.400 --> 01:02.167
just been having
this recurring nightmare

01:02.167 --> 01:03.167
where I--

01:03.167 --> 01:05.333
I shake a magic 8-ball toy

01:05.333 --> 01:08.567
and the lifeless head
of my victim bobs up...

01:08.567 --> 01:10.733
into the portal.

01:10.733 --> 01:13.100
As if to say,

01:13.100 --> 01:15.367
"Outlook not so good."

01:16.433 --> 01:18.200
Okay.

01:18.200 --> 01:20.567
First up comes Sharon

01:20.567 --> 01:22.567
from Inverness, Florida.

01:22.567 --> 01:23.967
The Sunshine State.

01:23.967 --> 01:25.733
When my parents read
my new poem about

01:25.733 --> 01:27.800
a butterfly nostalgic
for its caterpillar days,

01:27.800 --> 01:30.100
they sent me to a shrink
who wrote me

01:30.100 --> 01:31.767
a Lexapro prescription.

01:31.767 --> 01:33.500
I mean, what,
am I just gonna be, like,

01:33.500 --> 01:35.367
happy all the time?

01:35.367 --> 01:36.867
What's that like?

01:36.867 --> 01:38.867
Oh.
Re--oh.

01:38.867 --> 01:40.867
Wow. Okay.

01:40.867 --> 01:42.267
- That's a big relief.
- Mm-hmm.

01:42.267 --> 01:43.567
I mean, that could've been
anything.

01:43.567 --> 01:45.300
"What's it like
to be happy all the time?"

01:45.300 --> 01:47.267
- I like that one.
- Uh-huh.

01:47.267 --> 01:48.800
I don't know
what's in store for me now,

01:48.800 --> 01:50.733
but it hardly matters
'cause no matter what it is,

01:50.733 --> 01:54.067
I'm gonna be happy.
All the time.

01:54.067 --> 01:57.333
(Forrest voice-over)
Even for someone who isn't
constantly thinking

01:57.333 --> 01:59.100
about the human being
he killed,

01:59.100 --> 02:00.900
it can be difficult
to maintain

02:00.900 --> 02:02.367
a constant state of happiness.

02:02.367 --> 02:05.433
Lucille, do you see that
the sun is shining today?

02:05.433 --> 02:08.533
Yeah. Did you read the article
that says our sunscreen

02:08.533 --> 02:10.067
is totally ineffective?

02:10.067 --> 02:12.100
Happily, no.
No, I did not.

02:12.100 --> 02:14.233
We're all gonna die
of skin cancer.

02:14.233 --> 02:16.467
I'll send you the link.

02:16.467 --> 02:19.300
Always happy to receive a link.
[chuckles]

02:19.300 --> 02:21.733
(Forrest voice-over)
The world has a way of trying
to bring people down,

02:21.733 --> 02:24.500
but a happy person finds
solutions to little problems

02:24.500 --> 02:26.367
like the deadly rays
of the sun.

02:26.367 --> 02:28.533
Why don't the two of you
go out and find me

02:28.533 --> 02:31.200
a parasol? Huh?

02:31.200 --> 02:32.867
Oh, I don't know
how to do that.

02:32.867 --> 02:34.333
That's great because
now you have a chance

02:34.333 --> 02:36.933
to learn something,
right?

02:36.933 --> 02:38.100
Hey,
and while you're at it,

02:38.100 --> 02:39.333
you know what else
would make me happy?

02:39.333 --> 02:40.833
Uh...get me a treat.

02:40.833 --> 02:42.233
Like a sweet treat.
[smacks lips]

02:42.233 --> 02:46.400
That will make me happy.
Thank you so much.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.400
[whistles]
Hey.

02:48.400 --> 02:51.300
(Forrest voice-over)
Being happy about everything
the universe brought my way

02:51.300 --> 02:53.967
was clearly a bizarre way
to go through life.

02:53.967 --> 02:55.400
Hey, Lucille,
look who found

02:55.400 --> 02:57.567
some effective sunscreen
after all.

02:57.567 --> 02:59.467
(Forrest voice-over)
And it was made all the more
complicated

02:59.467 --> 03:01.833
but a surprise visit
from my ex-wife.

03:01.833 --> 03:03.967
Oh, Suzanne.
Oh, wow.

03:03.967 --> 03:05.300
Oh, great. Okay.

03:05.300 --> 03:07.067
Could you
put the parasol down?

03:07.067 --> 03:09.900
- I'd be happy to.
- I just want to sit and talk.

03:09.900 --> 03:11.467
- Oh.
- The thing is, Forrest...

03:11.467 --> 03:13.667
- Uh-huh.
- I've decided that what would

03:13.667 --> 03:15.667
be best for me,
and for Eric--

03:15.667 --> 03:17.200
would be best for
both of us,

03:17.200 --> 03:19.067
- Mm-hmm.
- Is if we were to have...

03:19.067 --> 03:21.700
a little break from you

03:21.700 --> 03:25.167
and whatever effect that you
may be having on our lives.

03:25.167 --> 03:27.067
(Forrest voice-over)
This was terrible news,

03:27.067 --> 03:29.133
but given the parameters
of this review,

03:29.133 --> 03:31.467
there was only one way
to react.

03:33.167 --> 03:36.100
[chuckles]

03:37.633 --> 03:39.633
- Yay. [laughs]
- Yay?

03:39.633 --> 03:41.467
Well, yeah.
I think it's--

03:41.467 --> 03:42.967
- I think that's great.
- You do?

03:42.967 --> 03:44.733
I do.
I do, I do, I do, I do.

03:44.733 --> 03:46.633
- [laughs]
- Oh, okay,

03:46.633 --> 03:48.300
'cause I-I--
you know, I'm surprised.

03:48.300 --> 03:50.633
I thought you were gonna,
like, literally freak out

03:50.633 --> 03:52.167
and start,
like, throwing things

03:52.167 --> 03:53.333
- and...
- [laughs]

03:53.333 --> 03:55.233
No, I can see why
that's a good idea.

03:55.233 --> 03:56.667
- Okay. Okay.
- Yeah.

03:56.667 --> 03:58.833
Well, good, because I--
what I would like to do...

03:58.833 --> 04:01.067
- Uh-huh?
- Is for you to waive

04:01.067 --> 04:02.633
all of your visitation rights

04:02.633 --> 04:05.767
and have no contact
with us at all.

04:08.833 --> 04:10.633
Bye-bye, visitation rights.

04:10.633 --> 04:13.100
- [chuckles]
- Are you okay?

04:13.100 --> 04:14.833
- Yeah. Yup.
- What is this?

04:14.833 --> 04:16.067
Are you on something,
or...

04:16.067 --> 04:17.633
No, I'm not on anything,
I'm just--

04:17.633 --> 04:19.533
I'm just--
What you're saying

04:19.533 --> 04:21.167
- makes me happy.
- It does?

04:21.167 --> 04:22.400
It does.
It really makes me happy.

04:22.400 --> 04:24.133
To not see me and Eric
at all?

04:24.133 --> 04:27.533
Um, how long were you
thinking for the break?

04:27.533 --> 04:30.167
Well, I was thinking
something around two months.

04:30.167 --> 04:32.167
For starters.
With no contact...

04:32.167 --> 04:33.733
(Forrest voice-over)
If I weren't so very happy,

04:33.733 --> 04:35.933
I might have begged her
to change her mind.

04:35.933 --> 04:37.967
- Hooray.
- Hooray?

04:37.967 --> 04:40.167
Yes. See, I think
two months is gonna go by

04:40.167 --> 04:41.567
just like that!
[laughs]

04:41.567 --> 04:43.067
(Forrest voice-over)
And the happy news kept coming.

04:43.067 --> 04:44.433
(man) Are you Forrest MacNeil?
- Yes, I am.

04:44.433 --> 04:45.667
Stand up and put
your hands behind your head.

04:45.667 --> 04:46.900
You're under arrest
for homicide.

04:46.900 --> 04:48.067
- Okay, uh...
- What's happening?

04:48.067 --> 04:49.167
(Suzanne) Homicide?
- Stand up.

04:49.167 --> 04:50.367
Put your hands
behind your head.

04:50.367 --> 04:51.533
(Suzanne)
Forrest, what did you do?

04:51.533 --> 04:52.767
Yay! It's great to hear
my rights.

04:52.767 --> 04:54.267
You have the right
to remain silent...

04:54.267 --> 04:55.433
There they go. I'm so glad
for the Constitution.

04:55.433 --> 04:56.567
You have the right
to an attorney.

04:56.567 --> 04:57.667
I'm so glad we
got rid of the king...

04:57.667 --> 04:59.067
If you cannot afford
an attorney...

04:59.067 --> 05:00.433
- So we have rights now.
- One will be provided for you.

05:00.433 --> 05:01.533
(Suzanne)
Forrest, did you kill somebody?

05:01.533 --> 05:02.800
I will see you
in two months, Suzanne!

05:02.800 --> 05:04.133
Forrest!

05:04.133 --> 05:07.133
(Forrest)
I get to take a ride
in a police car!

05:07.133 --> 05:10.167
(Forrest voice-over)
Somewhere in the process
of being charged with murder,

05:10.167 --> 05:11.733
interrogated, arraigned,

05:11.733 --> 05:13.733
and transferred
to the County Jail,

05:13.733 --> 05:16.433
I decided to put
life reviewing on hold

05:16.433 --> 05:19.433
until this very serious matter
could be resolved.

05:19.433 --> 05:20.600
What are you doing?

05:20.600 --> 05:22.467
They gave us permission
to shoot here.

05:22.467 --> 05:25.233
(Forrest voice-over)
Then I got a visit
from my producer, Grant.

05:25.233 --> 05:27.167
You wanna kee--

05:28.467 --> 05:29.833
You wanna keep
doing the show?

05:29.833 --> 05:31.733
- Oh, yes.
- No, I can't--

05:31.733 --> 05:34.067
Sorry, I can't...
think about that right now.

05:34.067 --> 05:36.133
You know, if I'm convicted,
I'm looking at life in prison.

05:36.133 --> 05:39.867
- Okay?
- I need you to look at life...

05:39.867 --> 05:42.067
in prison.

05:42.067 --> 05:43.767
I need to be totally
focused on

05:43.767 --> 05:46.067
getting the [bleep]
out of here.

05:46.067 --> 05:48.067
Okay? Can you help me
with that, please?

05:48.067 --> 05:49.067
I thought--
I had thought you were here

05:49.067 --> 05:50.233
to bail me out
or something.

05:50.233 --> 05:51.767
So you wanna
stop the show now?

05:51.767 --> 05:53.600
At this point
it is making

05:53.600 --> 05:56.100
for incredible television.

05:56.100 --> 05:58.433
I just--Grant,
I need to go home.

05:58.433 --> 06:00.500
Okay?
Or back to the office.

06:00.500 --> 06:03.367
Forrest, look,
where this gets done

06:03.367 --> 06:05.533
is less important than
who does it.

06:05.533 --> 06:08.800
Everyone is so grateful
for the sacrifices

06:08.800 --> 06:10.100
that you make.

06:10.100 --> 06:12.867
They look up to you,
they're inspired by you.

06:12.867 --> 06:15.967
(Forrest voice-over)
What Grant was proposing
sounded completely unreasonable,

06:15.967 --> 06:18.100
but his argument
was compelling.

06:18.100 --> 06:19.433
Oh, my God,
do you remember how amazing

06:19.433 --> 06:21.067
you were at the orgy?

06:21.067 --> 06:22.333
- Well, yeah, I mean...
- Let me tell you something,

06:22.333 --> 06:24.233
the footage from Happiness,
makes that look like

06:24.233 --> 06:25.800
the saddest [bleep]-fest
ever.

06:25.800 --> 06:27.800
- It's making me feel happy.
- Oh.

06:27.800 --> 06:29.167
That's the effect
it's having.

06:29.167 --> 06:32.067
Yeah, it felt great
and then they arrested me.

06:32.067 --> 06:34.600
So, imagine people
seeing you here in prison.

06:34.600 --> 06:37.967
How inspiring it will be
to people.

06:37.967 --> 06:39.867
Don't let
the people down.

06:41.833 --> 06:44.933
(Forrest voice-over)
Once again I was reminded
that there were people out there

06:44.933 --> 06:47.267
and they count on me
to do this work.

06:47.267 --> 06:50.600
I could not give up just because
I happen to be in jail.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.433
Grant had given me
the juicer

06:52.433 --> 06:55.967
to take prison
and turn it in to prisonade.

06:55.967 --> 06:58.933
Trying to be happy all the time
led me to the thought,

06:58.933 --> 07:02.067
"How much control do we have
over our emotional life?"

07:02.067 --> 07:04.167
Is it something that we
receive helplessly,

07:04.167 --> 07:05.600
like the weather,
or is it something

07:05.600 --> 07:07.667
- that we can control?
- Like the weather.

07:07.667 --> 07:10.267
Uh, no, my point was
that the weather

07:10.267 --> 07:12.167
is something that you
can't control.

07:12.167 --> 07:13.633
But what if you
move to Hawaii?

07:15.767 --> 07:18.733
Yeah, that would be a way
of controlling the weather.

07:18.733 --> 07:21.333
[clears throat]
Constant happiness may seem like

07:21.333 --> 07:23.767
the most absurd way to live,
but it is also,

07:23.767 --> 07:26.467
perhaps, the least absurd
way to live.

07:26.467 --> 07:28.400
And, so, I give it...

07:30.667 --> 07:32.600
- Three stars.
- Zing.

07:36.267 --> 07:37.933
What is next
for me, A.J.?

07:37.933 --> 07:42.133
Hmm, Donnie from
Laurinburg, North Carolina

07:42.133 --> 07:45.600
wrote: "Dear Forrest,
my upbringing was very strict,

07:45.600 --> 07:48.400
"we weren't even allowed to
drink milk because Father said

07:48.400 --> 07:50.600
"it reminded him
of tantalizing breasts.

07:50.600 --> 07:53.167
"I've since grown up
and had milk, of course,

07:53.167 --> 07:56.067
"but I've still never had
a pillow fight.

07:56.067 --> 07:57.933
What's that like?"

07:59.700 --> 08:02.167
So, ignore all
the milk stuff,

08:02.167 --> 08:03.300
but what's it like
to have a pillow fight?

08:03.300 --> 08:05.167
Am I understanding
what you said there?

08:05.167 --> 08:06.933
Sounds like it.

08:06.933 --> 08:08.367
Zing.

08:08.367 --> 08:09.733
[buzzer alarms]

08:09.733 --> 08:11.167
(Forrest voice-over)
Unlike most pillow fights,

08:11.167 --> 08:13.400
this one would have to
take place in a County jail

08:13.400 --> 08:15.800
where I was awaiting trial
for murder.

08:15.800 --> 08:18.333
I requested a meeting
with the prison psychiatrist.

08:18.333 --> 08:19.867
You wanted to see me
for something?

08:19.867 --> 08:21.833
Yes, I think I have
figured out a way

08:21.833 --> 08:25.700
to reform
the chronically violent.

08:25.700 --> 08:27.700
I want to organize
a pillow fight.

08:27.700 --> 08:29.200
And I know
that sounds crazy,

08:29.200 --> 08:31.500
but the idea is that
it could divert

08:31.500 --> 08:35.067
everyone's aggressive
feelings into harmless fun.

08:35.067 --> 08:36.467
So what do you say?

08:37.667 --> 08:39.833
May be worth a shot.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.533
Is that a yes?

08:43.533 --> 08:46.367
(Forrest voice-over)
Apparently that was a yes
because later that day

08:46.367 --> 08:48.100
a guards versus prisoners

08:48.100 --> 08:50.433
pillow fight
received official approval.

08:50.433 --> 08:52.600
Did you see that? We're gonna
have a pillow fight on Tuesday.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.533
You are all
cordially invited

08:54.533 --> 08:58.233
to a prisoners versus guards
pillow fight.

08:58.233 --> 09:00.500
It's gonna be
a little bit fun.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.233
[laughs]
I'm pretty sure.

09:02.233 --> 09:04.767
(Forrest voice-over)
The life of an accused murderer
behind bars

09:04.767 --> 09:06.767
is a lonely
and frightening one.

09:06.767 --> 09:09.200
This pillow fight seemed like
a good opportunity

09:09.200 --> 09:11.500
to get to know people
and to take my mind

09:11.500 --> 09:14.167
off of the terrible guilt
that was consuming me.

09:14.167 --> 09:16.067
This pillow fight
was MacNeil's suggestion,

09:16.067 --> 09:17.400
so let's all thank him
for coming up with

09:17.400 --> 09:18.567
a new activity
for you all.

09:18.567 --> 09:20.333
[applause]
- It's my pleasure.

09:20.333 --> 09:22.133
All right, MacNeil,
this is your baby.

09:22.133 --> 09:24.467
- You wanna start us off?
- Well, I mean, listen,

09:24.467 --> 09:25.800
the great thing
about a pillow fight

09:25.800 --> 09:27.867
is the simplicity of it.
My question for you is:

09:27.867 --> 09:30.367
"Hey, who is ready to
feel like a kid again?"

09:30.367 --> 09:32.167
[laughs]
Okay.

09:32.167 --> 09:34.067
The other thing that I want
to tell you about pillow fights,

09:34.067 --> 09:36.333
just so you're aware,

09:36.333 --> 09:38.167
is that in a pillow fight,
you never know

09:38.167 --> 09:41.167
when you might get
a sneak-attack.

09:41.167 --> 09:43.900
[laughs]
I surprised you, right?

09:43.900 --> 09:45.567
See that?
Okay...

09:45.567 --> 09:47.067
Well, come on, now.
Oh, ay, ay, ay, ay.

09:47.067 --> 09:49.067
Let's all join in.
All right?

09:49.067 --> 09:51.100
Let's have a pillow fight!

09:51.100 --> 09:53.833
[laughs]

09:53.833 --> 09:55.733
- [grunts]
- Oh, [bleep]!

09:55.733 --> 09:57.967
- [groans]
- Hey, hey, hey!

09:57.967 --> 10:00.800
[grunting, groaning]

10:00.800 --> 10:02.333
They're [bleep]ing weighted!

10:02.333 --> 10:04.267
(Forrest voice-over)
I had not considered that

10:04.267 --> 10:07.333
while these men may have been
novices at pillow fighting...

10:07.333 --> 10:08.733
(Forrest)
Where did the weights
come from?

10:08.733 --> 10:10.167
(Forrest voice-over)
They had expertise at smuggling

10:10.167 --> 10:12.300
items into places
they did not belong.

10:12.300 --> 10:13.633
Stop it! Stop it!

10:13.633 --> 10:14.733
(Forrest voice-over)
Places like prisons...

10:14.733 --> 10:16.767
and pillowcases.

10:16.767 --> 10:19.467
The resulting melee
was a terrifying horror

10:19.467 --> 10:21.833
- to behold.
- You set us up, MacNeil!

10:21.833 --> 10:23.500
- What? I didn't do anything!
- Oh, you did!

10:23.500 --> 10:25.233
[screams]

10:25.233 --> 10:27.533
- [electricity crackles]
- [screams]

10:27.533 --> 10:30.467
[police siren blaring]

10:34.233 --> 10:36.167
Was it darkness
within the hearts

10:36.167 --> 10:37.967
of the pillow fighters
that turned innocent

10:37.967 --> 10:40.367
sleeping equipment
into improvised...

10:40.367 --> 10:44.000
deadly weapons?

10:44.000 --> 10:47.467
Or is pillow fighting
a twisted bloodsport

10:47.467 --> 10:49.933
in disguise,
a feather-stuffed form

10:49.933 --> 10:53.167
of combat that inspires
brutality in otherwise

10:53.167 --> 10:54.633
gentle creatures?

10:54.633 --> 10:56.067
No way to know for sure.

10:56.067 --> 10:58.900
What I do know is that
my dreams of world peace

10:58.900 --> 11:02.967
and my nose were shattered
together in one fell swoop.

11:02.967 --> 11:06.200
And, so, I am forced
to give pillow-fighting...

11:06.200 --> 11:09.633
just one--oh, sorry.

11:09.633 --> 11:11.267
I want to get
the plies together.

11:12.667 --> 11:13.633
Toilet paper.

11:15.400 --> 11:17.833
- One star.
- Zing.

11:17.833 --> 11:19.500
What is my next review,
A.J.?

11:19.500 --> 11:20.500
- Okay...
- Mm-hmm.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.133
The next one was Tweeted to us

11:22.133 --> 11:25.133
from @CrazySonOfABeth.

11:25.133 --> 11:27.267
"Dear Forrest,
our six year old recently

11:27.267 --> 11:29.467
"told us about
her imaginary friend.

11:29.467 --> 11:31.533
"We haven't liked any
of her real friends

11:31.533 --> 11:34.167
"and are worried we're not
gonna like this one, either.

11:34.167 --> 11:36.433
What's it like to have
an imaginary friend?"

11:36.433 --> 11:38.067
- Ooh...yikes.
- Oh.

11:38.067 --> 11:40.400
Well, I'm not
afraid of that.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.900
What's it like to have
an imaginary friend?

11:41.900 --> 11:44.733
I will find out
and I'll let you know.

11:44.733 --> 11:46.867
(Forrest voice-over)
I had been feeling
oppressively alone

11:46.867 --> 11:48.800
and plagued by dark thoughts,

11:48.800 --> 11:51.233
so I was greatly relieved
that this review

11:51.233 --> 11:52.800
gave me someone to talk to.

11:52.800 --> 11:55.367
I got bad news.
You fell right into my trap.

11:55.367 --> 11:56.967
(Forrest voice-over)
I named him Clovers.

11:56.967 --> 12:00.233
He was kind, respectful,
and admiring.

12:00.233 --> 12:01.867
We hit it off beautifully.

12:01.867 --> 12:03.533
Oh, yeah. I guess I am
pretty good at this.

12:03.533 --> 12:05.500
Thank you.
That's nice of you to say it.

12:05.500 --> 12:07.300
(Forrest voice-over)
We shared the same
sense of humor.

12:07.300 --> 12:10.433
I don't know.
How does Yoda order a pizza?

12:10.433 --> 12:13.867
Oh.
[laughing]

12:13.867 --> 12:15.067
You're gonna get in trouble
for that.

12:15.067 --> 12:16.700
I would never tell a joke
like that.

12:16.700 --> 12:17.833
[laughing]

12:17.833 --> 12:19.467
That's a good one.

12:19.467 --> 12:21.067
(Forrest voice-over)
We trusted each other
completely,

12:21.067 --> 12:22.867
and confided in
one another.

12:22.867 --> 12:25.567
Yeah, so then she tells me
that she wants a two month break

12:25.567 --> 12:26.900
from me contacting her.

12:26.900 --> 12:28.633
Hey, I don't even know
your situation.

12:28.633 --> 12:30.233
Are you single?
Married or...

12:30.233 --> 12:32.633
[bleep] [bleep]
[bleep].

12:32.633 --> 12:34.767
I'm actually not
talking to you.

12:34.767 --> 12:37.733
I'm talking to Clovers,
okay?

12:37.733 --> 12:39.667
Kind of nosy.
[chuckles]

12:39.667 --> 12:41.267
(Forrest voice-over)
Perhaps after all
I'd been through,

12:41.267 --> 12:43.133
I was not thinking
clearly,

12:43.133 --> 12:45.133
but this imaginary person
had come to mean

12:45.133 --> 12:46.633
a great deal to me.

12:46.633 --> 12:50.200
I set out to be the best friend
I could ever be to anyone.

12:50.200 --> 12:53.500
I would like you all
to meet my new friend Clovers

12:53.500 --> 12:54.800
who is gonna be
joining us for lunch.

12:54.800 --> 12:56.233
Okay?

12:56.233 --> 12:58.300
You must have got hit in
the head pretty hard, MacNeil.

12:58.300 --> 12:59.700
There's no one there, man.

12:59.700 --> 13:01.067
They're just hazing
the new guy.

13:01.067 --> 13:03.233
Forget about it, Clovers.
Just ignore 'em.

13:03.233 --> 13:04.500
Hi, what are you doing?
Excuse me.

13:04.500 --> 13:05.967
No, no. Hey.
Whoa, no, no, no. Excuse me.

13:05.967 --> 13:08.133
Sorry, no.
You're sitting on Clovers.

13:08.133 --> 13:10.067
[bleep] [bleep],
who's Clovers?

13:10.067 --> 13:11.900
Clovers, my best friend,
and you're sitting on him.

13:11.900 --> 13:13.533
Right now, he's sitting there.
This is Clover's seat.

13:13.533 --> 13:15.167
I need you to get up
and go sit someplace else.

13:15.167 --> 13:17.433
[laughter]

13:17.433 --> 13:19.333
Will you please get off
of my friend now?

13:19.333 --> 13:21.900
No, he's real comfy.

13:21.900 --> 13:23.533
Get off of--
get off of my friend.

13:23.533 --> 13:25.900
- Oh, [bleep]!
- Hey, hey, hey!

13:25.900 --> 13:27.367
- [bleep]!
- It's okay, it's okay.

13:27.367 --> 13:28.667
Who wants some alone time,
huh?

13:28.667 --> 13:29.967
It's okay, everything's fine.

13:29.967 --> 13:32.067
Clovers has very generously
offered you his seat,

13:32.067 --> 13:34.633
so you can sit there,
and then I, in turn,

13:34.633 --> 13:36.933
will offer Clovers my seat.
He's sitting there.

13:36.933 --> 13:38.133
And then I'm happy
to stand.

13:38.133 --> 13:40.067
- Sit down.
- No, the table's full.

13:40.067 --> 13:42.067
Oh, really? Shut the [bleep] up.
Sit down.

13:42.067 --> 13:45.200
Uh, he can stand.
He's gonna stand.

13:45.200 --> 13:48.267
Hey, Clovers, question:
What are you in for?

13:48.267 --> 13:49.967
(Forrest voice-over)
My insistence that Clovers exist

13:49.967 --> 13:53.733
in the imagination of others
had unintended consequences.

13:53.733 --> 13:55.267
You murdered your last
best friend

13:55.267 --> 13:57.300
- just like you always do.
- Uh-oh.

13:57.300 --> 13:58.800
Watch your back, MacNeil.

13:58.800 --> 14:00.833
(Forrest voice-over)
Imaginations don't always agree.

14:00.833 --> 14:02.067
You're gonna [bleep]
MacNeil's mouth

14:02.067 --> 14:03.367
before you slice him up
and kill him?

14:03.367 --> 14:05.533
(all) Oh!
[laughter]

14:05.533 --> 14:07.400
When you say [bleep]
my mouth,

14:07.400 --> 14:09.367
you just mean have a
conversation, right? Yeah.

14:09.367 --> 14:11.067
(Forrest voice-over)
I was now locked
in a checkers match

14:11.067 --> 14:12.067
to control the story
of my friend.

14:17.967 --> 14:19.933
Oh, Clovers,
just like that.

14:19.933 --> 14:22.967
Hey, hey, hey.
You got to leave Clovers alone.

14:22.967 --> 14:24.900
First of all, it's none
of your business

14:24.900 --> 14:26.067
what Clovers and me do.

14:26.067 --> 14:27.967
Secondmost,
it's his idea.

14:27.967 --> 14:30.300
We're trying to have
a gentle, romantic moment here.

14:30.300 --> 14:32.067
Oh! Whoo!

14:32.067 --> 14:34.400
(Forrest voice-over)
This inmate, an armed robber
named Cassius,

14:34.400 --> 14:35.567
may have started it,

14:35.567 --> 14:37.767
but in no time at all,
sex with Clovers

14:37.767 --> 14:41.067
had become the new prison slang
for masturbation.

14:41.067 --> 14:42.800
[prisoners shouting]

14:42.800 --> 14:45.467
Everybody all at the same time.
How is that even possible?

14:45.467 --> 14:48.500
(Cassius)
Get the balls, Clovers.
Oh! Oh!

14:48.500 --> 14:51.567
(Forrest voice-over)
I had now had enough human
contact with my fellow prisoners

14:51.567 --> 14:53.933
to know that I much preferred
to be left alone

14:53.933 --> 14:55.467
with my imaginary friend.

14:55.467 --> 14:57.600
Hey, Clovers,
forget about MacNeil.

14:57.600 --> 14:59.533
Come over here, play a little
Connect Fourwith me.

14:59.533 --> 15:02.167
Yeah, Clovers says,
"No, thank you," okay?

15:02.167 --> 15:03.733
We're having
a good time.

15:03.733 --> 15:06.767
Whoa, and here he comes.
My man, Clovers.

15:06.767 --> 15:09.067
(Forrest voice-over)
It appeared that Clovers
had now become a symbol

15:09.067 --> 15:10.800
in a prison yard
power struggle.

15:10.800 --> 15:13.900
Cassius wanted to show he could
take whatever he wanted from me

15:13.900 --> 15:15.300
whenever he wanted.

15:15.300 --> 15:17.200
Oh, Clovers,
that was mean.

15:17.200 --> 15:20.200
You just tricked Cassius that
you were gonna go play with him,

15:20.200 --> 15:22.300
and now you're coming back here
to play checkers with me.

15:22.300 --> 15:24.100
Oh! Oh, snap!

15:24.100 --> 15:26.233
You were only
tricking MacNeil

15:26.233 --> 15:28.200
into thinking that
you were tricking me.

15:28.200 --> 15:29.667
That's a double cross.

15:29.667 --> 15:32.733
You're a bad man.
You're a bad man, Clovers.

15:32.733 --> 15:35.300
The triple cross?
Unbelievable!

15:35.300 --> 15:36.967
I mean, he really,
really thought

15:36.967 --> 15:38.167
that you were gonna play
Connect Four.

15:38.167 --> 15:39.933
Quadruple cross!

15:39.933 --> 15:41.100
And what are you doing?

15:41.100 --> 15:43.067
Putting an electromagnet
in your pants

15:43.067 --> 15:45.567
so you can't get up off
of this metal seat?

15:45.567 --> 15:47.567
Five cross?
Unbelievable.

15:47.567 --> 15:49.067
And the magnet doesn't work.

15:49.067 --> 15:50.933
I understand you have to stay
in contact

15:50.933 --> 15:52.467
with him so you can
eventually murder him.

15:52.467 --> 15:54.133
Maybe you're intimidated,
you feel like you have to

15:54.133 --> 15:55.633
go over there
but there's no reason for that.

15:55.633 --> 15:57.133
Guys like this
are all bluster.

15:57.133 --> 15:59.600
What you really would like
to do is dance?

15:59.600 --> 16:01.567
- Come on.
- Be careful. Leave me alone.

16:01.567 --> 16:03.233
[laughs]

16:03.233 --> 16:04.467
Dance-off, MacNeil.

16:04.467 --> 16:06.800
Oh, get 'em, Cas.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.600
[laughter]

16:08.600 --> 16:09.733
Pardon me, may I cut in?

16:09.733 --> 16:11.767
- Thank you, yes.
- Oh!

16:11.767 --> 16:13.367
Come here, buddy.

16:13.367 --> 16:14.933
Oh, you don't like that style
of dance?

16:14.933 --> 16:17.433
Oh, traditional Irish
step-dancing?

16:17.433 --> 16:18.800
I don't know but I'll try.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.067
Oh, you're really good at it.
Look at you.

16:20.067 --> 16:21.967
Nobody likes feeling
like a leprechaun.

16:21.967 --> 16:23.133
Time for break dancing?

16:23.133 --> 16:24.733
Oh, break it out, MacNeil.

16:24.733 --> 16:26.833
Who thinks that Clovers wants
to be my best friend?

16:26.833 --> 16:28.833
- Yeah!
- Looks like he made his choice.

16:28.833 --> 16:30.233
- Then circled the table.
- He made his choice.

16:30.233 --> 16:31.567
- We're gonna play checkers.
- Taking a lap

16:31.567 --> 16:33.233
to think about it.
Here he comes around here.

16:33.233 --> 16:34.767
- Look it. There he goes.
- The rude faces you're making.

16:34.767 --> 16:35.833
Oh! He just put a yellow in!

16:35.833 --> 16:37.100
Oh! He didn't do that [bleep].

16:37.100 --> 16:38.267
- You put that yellow there.
- [shouting]

16:38.267 --> 16:39.400
[guard blows whistle]

16:39.400 --> 16:40.267
- You put it there.
- [shouting]

16:40.267 --> 16:41.267
Visiting hours.

16:41.267 --> 16:42.267
MacNeil.

16:42.267 --> 16:44.633
You got one.

16:44.633 --> 16:46.067
- [bleep].
- There he goes.

16:46.067 --> 16:47.100
[shouting]
- There he goes.

16:47.100 --> 16:48.433
[laughs]

16:48.433 --> 16:51.067
- After you.
- [bleep].

16:51.067 --> 16:52.800
[door buzzes open]

16:52.800 --> 16:55.100
(Forrest voice-over)
Having my father see me
in a place like this

16:55.100 --> 16:57.400
was sure to be a difficult
experience.

16:57.400 --> 17:00.633
And one for which I would need
Clovers' emotional support.

17:00.633 --> 17:03.067
Clovers, this is my dad.

17:03.067 --> 17:06.800
Dad, this is Clovers.

17:06.800 --> 17:09.967
Uh, okay.

17:09.967 --> 17:12.300
Hello, Clovers.

17:12.300 --> 17:13.833
Well, I bailed you out.

17:13.833 --> 17:14.967
[sighs]

17:14.967 --> 17:17.433
Used the insurance money
from the house.

17:17.433 --> 17:19.967
Thank you so much, Dad.

17:19.967 --> 17:22.333
I can't even tell you how
terrible it's been in here.

17:22.333 --> 17:24.833
Boy, it's been a crazy year,
hasn't it?

17:24.833 --> 17:27.100
- Yeah.
- You know?

17:27.100 --> 17:28.500
You picked a fight
with that guy

17:28.500 --> 17:31.900
for absolutely no reason,
and got shot, and nearly died.

17:31.900 --> 17:33.067
Yeah.

17:33.067 --> 17:34.300
You broke up with that nurse

17:34.300 --> 17:37.267
in a way that she fired a gun
into the house.

17:37.267 --> 17:39.300
And then you burned
down the house.

17:39.300 --> 17:40.900
And you broke up
with another girl

17:40.900 --> 17:42.567
in a way that she fired an RPG

17:42.567 --> 17:43.900
and blew up theother house.

17:43.900 --> 17:44.967
- An RPG. Yes.
- Yeah.

17:44.967 --> 17:46.433
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah. Yeah.

17:46.433 --> 17:49.400
Then you asked me fire
a bunch of arrows at you

17:49.400 --> 17:51.900
- and I did.
[laughter]

17:51.900 --> 17:53.533
Scared the hell out of me,
you know?

17:53.533 --> 17:56.633
And then you got lost at sea
for three months.

17:56.633 --> 17:58.633
- Yeah.
- I never gave up hope.

17:58.633 --> 18:02.300
Through it all, I told myself,
"Forrest is a good boy.

18:02.300 --> 18:04.200
He always has been."

18:04.200 --> 18:07.967
But now a man is dead and
you're charged with killing him.

18:10.933 --> 18:13.200
What are your values, son?

18:13.200 --> 18:15.067
Did I raise you
to have values

18:15.067 --> 18:17.300
where it's okay to kill
somebody?

18:17.300 --> 18:19.933
I hope not.

18:19.933 --> 18:22.133
So I'm out.

18:22.133 --> 18:25.633
I just need to take care
of myself now.

18:25.633 --> 18:27.600
What are you talking about?

18:27.600 --> 18:31.500
Good luck, Forrest.

18:31.500 --> 18:32.833
Take care of him, Clovers.

18:35.767 --> 18:38.667
(Forrest voice-over)
And just like that,
my dad was gone.

18:38.667 --> 18:41.733
I would need Clovers' kindness,
support, and humor,

18:41.733 --> 18:43.300
now more than ever before.

18:48.433 --> 18:51.367
(Forrest voice-over)
Having been shockingly abandoned
by my ex-wife and now my father,

18:51.367 --> 18:54.633
Clovers was the only friend
I had left in the world.

18:54.633 --> 18:56.733
I just wanted to tell you that--

18:56.733 --> 19:00.067
(Forrest voice-over)
And leaving jail meant I'd be
saying good-bye to him too.

19:00.067 --> 19:01.267
You know,
I just wanna tell you

19:01.267 --> 19:02.800
how much your loyalty
means to me.

19:02.800 --> 19:04.967
I hope that you feel
like I've been as loyal to you

19:04.967 --> 19:06.833
as you have been to me 'cause
that's really what friendship

19:06.833 --> 19:08.867
is more than anything.

19:08.867 --> 19:11.267
You think you're pretty slick,
huh, MacNeil?

19:11.267 --> 19:13.567
Stealing your best friend
back from me.

19:13.567 --> 19:15.067
Okay, guys, I have explained
to you--

19:15.067 --> 19:17.733
No more talk, McNeil.

19:17.733 --> 19:21.233
If Clovers isn't my friend,
he's nobody's friend.

19:21.233 --> 19:22.433
- [grunting]
- What are you doing?

19:22.433 --> 19:25.133
No! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
No, no, no!

19:25.133 --> 19:26.733
Playtime is over, MacNeil.

19:26.733 --> 19:29.533
Watch your ass
or you're next.

19:29.533 --> 19:30.467
[grunts]

19:32.200 --> 19:34.167
Clovers, I got to get you
to the doctor right now.

19:34.167 --> 19:37.367
(Cassius)
He's dead, MacNeil,
we stabbed him in the heart.

19:37.367 --> 19:39.300
[somber music]
[weeping]

19:39.300 --> 19:41.333
Oh, no.

19:41.333 --> 19:43.300
Oh, God, Clovers.

19:43.300 --> 19:46.067
(Forrest voice-over)
Of all the things this show
had taken from me,

19:46.067 --> 19:48.400
the loss of Clovers,
who had understood

19:48.400 --> 19:51.867
and accepted me completely,
felt like the greatest tragedy

19:51.867 --> 19:53.167
of them all.

19:53.167 --> 19:56.533
It was real
and totally irreversible.

19:56.533 --> 20:00.233
And it revealed to me the utter
pointlessness and cruelty

20:00.233 --> 20:03.767
of everything that my life
had become.

20:03.767 --> 20:05.300
What the hell are you doing?

20:05.300 --> 20:07.633
They killed Clovers.

20:07.633 --> 20:10.367
Come on, it's time to go.
You're out.

20:10.367 --> 20:12.100
You just gonna leave him there?

20:12.100 --> 20:14.033
(Forrest voice-over)
When I began my imaginary
friendship,

20:14.033 --> 20:16.867
I saw it as as an imaginary
two-way street

20:16.867 --> 20:18.167
between Clovers and me.

20:18.167 --> 20:19.933
But soon,
it came to feel more like

20:19.933 --> 20:23.467
an imaginary chaotic
multi-street intersection

20:23.467 --> 20:27.433
with traffic laws so Byzantine
and confusing

20:27.433 --> 20:29.433
it's hard to imagine
the result being anything

20:29.433 --> 20:33.067
but bloody and tragic mayhem.

20:33.067 --> 20:35.367
In other words, imaginary
friendship turned out to be

20:35.367 --> 20:37.000
one holy mess.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.200
And yet, Clovers did keep
my loneliness at bay.

20:40.200 --> 20:43.833
So I give having
an imaginary friend three stars.

20:43.833 --> 20:46.700
[triumphant music]

20:46.700 --> 20:49.000
Well, that's all the time
we have for Review.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
Good night.

20:50.000 --> 20:50.933
Good night and good dreams.

20:59.067 --> 21:02.800
I don't know, why don't giraffes
eat lollipops?

21:02.800 --> 21:04.200
I give up. Why not?

21:04.200 --> 21:07.200
[laughs]

21:07.200 --> 21:08.200
That's silly.

21:08.200 --> 21:11.133
[laughs]
You're really funny.
