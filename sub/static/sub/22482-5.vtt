WEBVTT

00:02.203 --> 00:04.105
Okay, maybe I'm
old-fashioned.

00:04.138 --> 00:05.806
Says the man who
wears Aqua Velva.

00:05.839 --> 00:07.141
I thought you like that.

00:07.175 --> 00:09.110
I do. Go on with
your rant, honey.

00:09.143 --> 00:11.412
I just don't think
that dogs belong in stores.

00:11.445 --> 00:13.481
I can't take my ice cream
into a pet store,

00:13.514 --> 00:14.782
so why do all these people

00:14.815 --> 00:16.784
bring their dogs
into an ice cream store?

00:16.817 --> 00:18.386
They're service dogs.

00:18.419 --> 00:20.388
Really? How was that
ratty little poodle

00:20.421 --> 00:22.556
being of service to that woman
with the big, fake lips?

00:22.590 --> 00:24.825
She must need him

00:24.858 --> 00:26.494
or she wouldn't have
bought him a stroller.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.829
Oh, d-don't get me started
on the strollers

00:28.862 --> 00:30.431
or the matching hats.

00:30.464 --> 00:32.433
You know, you're getting
dangerously close

00:32.466 --> 00:34.202
to old coot territory.

00:34.235 --> 00:35.803
(imitating old coot):
Which is just over yonder

00:35.836 --> 00:38.572
by those kids who won't
pick a damn gender!

00:38.606 --> 00:40.141
(phone chimes)

00:40.174 --> 00:42.276
(both laugh)

00:42.310 --> 00:44.145
It's Christy.

00:44.178 --> 00:46.147
Is that coconut or poodle fuzz?

00:46.180 --> 00:47.248
She wants me

00:47.281 --> 00:49.450
to pick up her waitress uniform
at the dry cleaner.

00:49.483 --> 00:51.852
I love how she thinks
I have nothing better to do.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.354
Do you?

00:53.387 --> 00:55.156
My side.
You're on my side.

00:55.189 --> 00:56.157
(chuckles)

00:56.190 --> 00:57.625
"Will try,

00:57.658 --> 01:00.561
but Adam in a
dark place again."

01:00.594 --> 01:02.563
Hey, hey, don't drag me
into this.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.498
Oh, I do it
all the time.

01:04.532 --> 01:07.201
If she asks, you have just
a kiss of manic depression.

01:07.235 --> 01:09.870
"Will try, but Adam
really ne..." (screams)

01:09.903 --> 01:12.440
Oh, my God. Are you all right?
Oh! Oh!

01:12.473 --> 01:15.276
This is bad. This is really bad.

01:15.309 --> 01:16.610
Okay, here, take my hands.
I'll pull you up.

01:16.644 --> 01:18.346
(grunts)

01:18.379 --> 01:20.181
Oh, stop. I can't stand.

01:20.214 --> 01:21.449
Honey, you got to get up.

01:21.482 --> 01:22.850
You're in a bus stop.

01:22.883 --> 01:24.352
Eventually,
there's gonna be a bus.

01:24.385 --> 01:25.453
(grunts) Okay.

01:25.486 --> 01:27.855
Let me try to drag myself out.

01:27.888 --> 01:30.090
All right.
Hurry, hurry.

01:31.592 --> 01:34.228
Did you just eat your ice cream?

01:34.262 --> 01:35.596
Uh, I don't know. Did I?

01:35.629 --> 01:38.332
How about when you're done
with your treat,

01:38.366 --> 01:40.201
you call 911!

01:41.902 --> 01:44.104
*

01:58.519 --> 02:00.288
So, what's the spa like?

02:00.321 --> 02:03.191
Oh, we take hikes
through the desert,

02:03.224 --> 02:06.260
we meditate,
we eat super healthy.

02:07.528 --> 02:10.231
It's been the worst week
of my life.

02:10.264 --> 02:11.599
Well, you look good.

02:11.632 --> 02:14.502
Damn well better look good
after I-- W-What's that?

02:15.536 --> 02:16.604
What are you eating?

02:16.637 --> 02:18.439
Just a muffin.

02:18.472 --> 02:20.174
Don't say "just a muffin" to me.

02:20.208 --> 02:22.142
I'm on ten calories a day.
Hold it up.

02:24.445 --> 02:26.647
Not the wrapper side.
Show me her face.

02:28.949 --> 02:32.253
Ooh, she's pretty.

02:32.286 --> 02:35.423
Jill, it's a muffin
I bought at a car wash.

02:35.456 --> 02:38.158
Oh, they're all the same
in the dark.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.562
What kind is it?

02:41.595 --> 02:42.930
Bran.

02:42.963 --> 02:44.632
Lie to me.

02:44.665 --> 02:47.368
Double chocolate chip.

02:47.401 --> 02:48.769
Yeah, it is.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.240
Take another bite.

02:52.273 --> 02:54.542
This is getting kind of weird.

02:54.575 --> 02:56.677
Take a bite!

02:56.710 --> 02:59.380
Oh, yeah.

02:59.413 --> 03:00.481
(door opens)

03:01.515 --> 03:03.284
Oh, got to go.

03:03.317 --> 03:04.552
I'm gonna reheat
some pizza later.

03:04.585 --> 03:05.719
I'll call you then.

03:05.753 --> 03:07.288
What time?!

03:07.321 --> 03:09.957
Hey, where's my mom?

03:09.990 --> 03:11.559
She asked me
to make sure you were here

03:11.592 --> 03:12.760
so she could make an entrance.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.762
What?
Come on in!

03:14.795 --> 03:16.597
Is she gonna do that thing
where she asks

03:16.630 --> 03:18.466
"What's different about me?"
and I'm gonna have to guess?

03:18.499 --> 03:20.368
Maybe, but it'll be easy.

03:24.338 --> 03:25.673
Oh, my God!

03:25.706 --> 03:27.241
What happened?

03:27.275 --> 03:28.642
You made me fall.

03:29.677 --> 03:31.412
How?

03:31.445 --> 03:33.414
You kept texting me
about your stupid dry cleaning

03:33.447 --> 03:34.982
while I was walking
and eating ice cream.

03:35.015 --> 03:36.484
I almost got hit by a bus.

03:37.618 --> 03:40.588
It was nine blocks away,
but she could see it.

03:40.621 --> 03:43.324
Are they broken?
Yes.

03:43.357 --> 03:44.758
No. She tore
a couple of ligaments.

03:44.792 --> 03:46.727
She'll be in the chair
for a few weeks.

03:46.760 --> 03:47.995
You hear that, Christy?

03:48.028 --> 03:49.730
Torn ligaments
because of your dry cleaning.

03:49.763 --> 03:54.001
Yeah. You have size 15 feet,
but sure, I'm the one at fault.

03:54.034 --> 03:56.670
The X-ray lady had trouble
getting 'em in the same shot.

03:56.704 --> 03:58.472
Hey! My side.

03:58.506 --> 04:01.742
Well, is there anything
I can do to help?

04:01.775 --> 04:03.744
For starters, you have to be
the building manager

04:03.777 --> 04:05.346
until I can walk again.

04:05.379 --> 04:08.482
I meant more like
get you a pillow.

04:08.516 --> 04:10.618
I'll take that, too.

04:10.651 --> 04:12.019
All right.

04:12.052 --> 04:13.654
Well, you know,
just write a list

04:13.687 --> 04:15.556
of things I need to do
around the building,

04:15.589 --> 04:17.625
and I'll be like you
and not do them.

04:17.658 --> 04:20.428
That's all I'm asking.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.666
BONNIE:
Oh, I'm slipping off the toilet!

04:25.699 --> 04:27.535
CHRISTY:
Just push yourself off the bowl!

04:27.568 --> 04:29.770
BONNIE: Grab my butt. Ow!
CHRISTY: Hold the towel rack!

04:29.803 --> 04:31.372
You're hurting my leg!
(Christy groans)

04:31.405 --> 04:32.640
CHRISTY:
Stop pulling my hair!

04:32.673 --> 04:35.042
BONNIE: Pull up my pants!
(glass breaks)

04:35.075 --> 04:38.579
CHRISTY: Great! Now we're gonna
have seven years bad luck.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.481
BONNIE:
How will we tell?

04:42.883 --> 04:45.519
I always knew someday she'd
need help using the toilet,

04:45.553 --> 04:48.055
but I was really hoping
I'd be dead by then.

04:48.088 --> 04:49.523
We better
get this worked out

04:49.557 --> 04:51.525
before I have my coffee
tomorrow morning.

04:51.559 --> 04:54.662
For what it's worth,
I really enjoyed listening.

04:54.695 --> 04:56.797
You guys should do a podcast.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.399
I'm glad you were entertained

04:58.432 --> 05:00.067
by me almost peeing
on my daughter's hand.

05:00.100 --> 05:01.402
"Almost"?!

05:01.435 --> 05:03.571
It was a direct hit!

05:03.604 --> 05:05.373
(ringtone playing)
Oh, great.

05:05.406 --> 05:06.540
Course my phone's
in the kitchen.

05:06.574 --> 05:07.641
Christy, do you mind?

05:07.675 --> 05:10.678
Hold on, I'm boiling my hand.

05:10.711 --> 05:13.447
She used to pay good money
for clean urine.

05:15.449 --> 05:16.584
Hello?

05:16.617 --> 05:18.552
Uh, uh-huh.

05:18.586 --> 05:21.489
Okay, I'll tell her.

05:21.522 --> 05:24.124
Beverly's smelling
something dead in her apartment.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.426
Not the first time.

05:25.459 --> 05:28.462
Hope and animals
go there to die.

05:28.496 --> 05:29.697
What do you want to do?

05:29.730 --> 05:30.864
Well, clearly
I can't do anything,

05:30.898 --> 05:32.566
but you better get right on it.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.101
Can't we just turn up the heat

05:34.134 --> 05:35.869
and see if whatever it is
dries out?

05:35.903 --> 05:37.838
Just get up there.

05:37.871 --> 05:39.840
Oh, and grab the hammer
out of my toolbox.

05:39.873 --> 05:41.775
Sometimes the dead thing
isn't completely dead.

05:41.809 --> 05:44.378
What?

05:44.412 --> 05:46.447
They scratch, they nip,
they try to lay eggs in you.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.681
It's disgusting.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.850
If the dead thing bites me,
I am biting you.

05:49.883 --> 05:52.853
Ooh. I'll bite you back.

05:52.886 --> 05:55.489
There's your podcast:

05:55.523 --> 05:57.525
sober chicks
who bite each other.

06:02.896 --> 06:04.865
Do you see anything?

06:04.898 --> 06:06.667
CHRISTY:
Yep, it's a dead mouse.

06:06.700 --> 06:07.801
Wait.

06:07.835 --> 06:09.369
Yeah, it's dead.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.906
(groans)

06:12.940 --> 06:14.842
You're gonna need
a new pair of tongs.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.878
Why? It's just
another kind of meat.

06:17.911 --> 06:20.481
Now I'm kind of glad

06:20.514 --> 06:22.516
I turned down
the lasagna you offered me.

06:22.550 --> 06:26.620
Okay, I'm just gonna go
throw Mickey in the Dumpster.

06:26.654 --> 06:28.922
After that, can you drive me
to the pharmacy?

06:28.956 --> 06:30.591
What?

06:30.624 --> 06:32.893
I can't drive at night.
Your mom takes me.

06:32.926 --> 06:36.163
My mother?
Yeah.

06:36.196 --> 06:38.699
My mother does you favors?

06:38.732 --> 06:39.967
Christy, it's not a kidney.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.769
It's just a ride
to the pharmacy.

06:41.802 --> 06:44.438
Okay.

06:44.472 --> 06:46.173
Well, I guess
I can take you.

06:46.206 --> 06:47.941
Thank you.
(mouse squeaking)

06:47.975 --> 06:50.410
Oh! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

06:53.246 --> 06:55.749
All right, off we go.

06:57.518 --> 06:59.653
(TV playing quietly)

06:59.687 --> 07:00.654
(channel changes)

07:00.688 --> 07:01.789
No.

07:01.822 --> 07:02.790
(channel changes)

07:02.823 --> 07:04.224
No.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.225
(channel changes)

07:05.258 --> 07:06.660
(scoffs) God, no.

07:06.694 --> 07:08.195
(channel changes)

07:08.228 --> 07:10.197
Wait.

07:10.230 --> 07:11.732
No.

07:11.765 --> 07:12.733
(channel changes)

07:12.766 --> 07:13.801
(sighs)

07:13.834 --> 07:16.604
Okay, we're back
to Matlock in Spanish.

07:18.906 --> 07:21.909
You know the worst thing
about being in a wheelchair?

07:24.578 --> 07:26.680
Enlighten me.

07:26.714 --> 07:29.216
I'm just so bored.

07:29.249 --> 07:31.819
I have all this energy
and nothing to do with it.

07:31.852 --> 07:35.022
It's like my usual sparkle
is being wasted.

07:35.055 --> 07:39.026
I wouldn't mind getting
a little of that sparkle on me.

07:39.059 --> 07:41.829
What are you talking about?

07:41.862 --> 07:44.732
Really?
The sparkle thing wasn't clear?

07:44.765 --> 07:45.966
(chuckles)

07:45.999 --> 07:47.768
Look at me. It's not happening.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.770
Oh, it's happening.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.972
Parts of it
have already started.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.666
BONNIE:
Pull me up. Pull me up.

08:18.699 --> 08:20.534
ADAM:
I'm pulling.

08:20.568 --> 08:22.836
BONNIE: Swivel and slide.
Swivel and slide!

08:22.870 --> 08:24.004
ADAM:
Stop flailing.

08:24.037 --> 08:26.273
BONNIE:
Oh! Hey, we got it.

08:26.306 --> 08:27.875
The right parts are touching.

08:27.908 --> 08:29.076
(both grunt)

08:29.109 --> 08:31.511
(both panting)

08:33.313 --> 08:36.283
We should probably
get undressed now.

08:36.316 --> 08:39.753
How about you just tickle
my back and we take a nap.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.924
All right.

08:43.957 --> 08:46.594
Just so you know,
the light is on.

08:46.627 --> 08:48.762
Oh, thanks, Christy.

08:48.796 --> 08:50.297
Mind if I ask a question?

08:50.330 --> 08:53.601
Why does a blind man
need a light bulb?

08:53.634 --> 08:55.603
That was the one.

08:55.636 --> 08:58.038
It helps regulate
my circadian rhythms.

08:58.071 --> 09:01.642
Also, I have friends who don't
like to sit in the dark.

09:01.675 --> 09:04.311
Oh, yeah.
Never thought about that.

09:04.344 --> 09:07.581
Can I ask one more favor?

09:07.615 --> 09:08.782
Sure.

09:08.816 --> 09:10.818
When your mom drops in
to fix something,

09:10.851 --> 09:13.654
she usually hangs around
and reads to me.

09:13.687 --> 09:16.790
Oh, come on. She does not.

09:16.824 --> 09:18.759
Started out she'd read my mail,

09:18.792 --> 09:20.761
then we worked our way
up to books.

09:20.794 --> 09:24.364
She never even read to me.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.099
That's a sad story.

09:26.133 --> 09:29.036
My book is
on the table.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.740
Okay.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.808
I guess I got a
couple minutes.

09:34.842 --> 09:36.844
From the bookmark, please.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.952
"Chapter 12.

09:44.985 --> 09:47.154
"She walked into my office

09:47.187 --> 09:51.024
"on legs that could wrap
around a man twice.

09:51.058 --> 09:53.627
"I felt a twinge
of jealousy

09:53.661 --> 09:55.362
for the cigarette
between her lips."

09:55.395 --> 09:56.830
Hey, Dr. Seuss,

09:56.864 --> 09:58.866
it's not a children's book.

10:01.434 --> 10:04.137
(breathy):
"I felt a twinge of jealousy

10:04.171 --> 10:06.039
for the cigarette
between her lips."

10:06.073 --> 10:07.808
Mmm.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.979
"The kind of lips

10:12.012 --> 10:17.718
that God made for one reason
and one reason only."

10:17.751 --> 10:20.821
Oh, that's graphic.

10:20.854 --> 10:23.757
Don't look at me.
Your mom picked the book.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.061
Hand to God,

10:28.095 --> 10:31.064
she reads to blind guys,
helps old people run errands,

10:31.098 --> 10:33.133
and-- get ready for this one--

10:33.166 --> 10:35.769
she got a tenant's Social
Security check in the mail,

10:35.803 --> 10:37.404
and she returned it.

10:37.437 --> 10:39.940
BOTH:
Whoa.

10:39.973 --> 10:43.844
Is it possible
my mom's secretly a nice person?

10:43.877 --> 10:45.879
No.
Not a chance.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.185
I mean, I'd get it
if my mom was bragging

10:52.219 --> 10:54.021
all over the place about
what a great person she is,

10:54.054 --> 10:56.156
but here's the thing--
she's not.

10:56.189 --> 10:58.926
She's doing all this nice stuff
on the down low.

10:58.959 --> 11:03.897
Okay, well, let's try
to look at this in a new way.

11:03.931 --> 11:06.967
We all know from sobriety
miracles can happen.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.737
Junkie hooker becomes CEO, sure.

11:09.770 --> 11:13.106
Bonnie Plunkett becomes
a nice person, no.

11:13.140 --> 11:15.075
People do change
in recovery.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.944
It's true.

11:16.977 --> 11:19.279
I used to be very
quiet and low energy.

11:19.312 --> 11:22.883
And you are an inspiration.

11:24.885 --> 11:27.855
But my mom is
a different kind of animal.

11:27.888 --> 11:30.958
My mom... is an animal.

11:30.991 --> 11:33.193
Well, you have every right
to feel that way

11:33.226 --> 11:35.996
given your history,
but maybe it's time

11:36.029 --> 11:39.332
we all admit
she's becoming a better person.

11:39.366 --> 11:42.002
Oh, please.
You know that story

11:42.035 --> 11:44.271
about the frog helping
the scorpion cross the river?

11:44.304 --> 11:46.106
Yeah. Your mother's
the scorpion,

11:46.139 --> 11:48.208
and she can't
change her nature.

11:48.241 --> 11:52.345
No. My mother's the river,
and everybody drowns in her.

11:57.284 --> 11:59.987
Okay, I got her
in the tub.

12:00.020 --> 12:02.355
With any luck, she'll doze off,
and that'll be that.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.825
(laughs)

12:04.858 --> 12:08.128
You guys are cute
when you wish each other dead.

12:10.263 --> 12:13.166
Make you a sandwich?
Thanks.

12:17.838 --> 12:20.841
So... you're marrying my mother.

12:20.874 --> 12:23.176
Unless she drowns
in that tub.

12:23.210 --> 12:25.979
Then you're
the right person to ask.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.950
I'm guessing there are things
about her you like.

12:29.983 --> 12:32.052
Of course.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.987
What are they?

12:34.021 --> 12:36.056
Are you looking
for something specific?

12:36.089 --> 12:39.392
For starters, do you think
she's a good person?

12:39.426 --> 12:43.997
Let me tell you
why I'm making a sandwich.

12:44.031 --> 12:46.399
Your mother and I were supposed
to go out to lunch today

12:46.433 --> 12:48.268
at that new Italian place.

12:50.137 --> 12:52.906
(sighs)
Hello there.

12:54.908 --> 12:56.409
We need a table for two,

12:56.443 --> 13:00.447
preferably by a window
because... you know.

13:02.049 --> 13:04.217
What do wheelchairs have
to do with the window?

13:04.251 --> 13:06.887
Shh. I got this.

13:06.920 --> 13:09.156
I'm sorry. We don't have
any tables available.

13:09.189 --> 13:11.925
Thanks anyway. I told you we
should've made a reservation.

13:11.959 --> 13:13.861
Hang on.
Sir, you can't turn us away.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.863
Do you realize
how challenging it is

13:15.896 --> 13:18.065
for us to just
get out of the house?

13:19.299 --> 13:20.934
Bonnie...
But today,

13:20.968 --> 13:22.335
we said, "Darn it,
let's go out

13:22.369 --> 13:25.205
for a nice lunch
like normal people."

13:26.473 --> 13:28.876
Are you kidding me?

13:28.909 --> 13:31.344
I'm so sorry. Let me see if
I can shift some things around.

13:31.378 --> 13:34.014
Please don't bother.
We're out of here.

13:34.047 --> 13:35.883
What? Why?
He's shifting.
Uh...

13:35.916 --> 13:37.450
You're unbelievable.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.853
I'm sorry. He's got a kiss
of manic depression.

13:39.887 --> 13:41.121
Keep shifting.
We'll be right back.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.291
Oh, my God, she's a monster.

13:45.392 --> 13:47.861
Thank you.
I feel so much better.

13:47.895 --> 13:48.929
What are you talking about?

13:48.962 --> 13:51.398
Well, Marjorie was trying

13:51.431 --> 13:54.267
to convince me that my mom's
becoming a better person.

13:55.969 --> 13:57.404
This is really good.

13:57.437 --> 13:59.940
Excellent lettuce-to-meat ratio.

13:59.973 --> 14:02.142
Thank you, but I...
I'm not done with the story.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.911
Oh, really?
Mm-hmm.

14:03.944 --> 14:07.180
What happened next?
She sucker-punch a baby?

14:07.214 --> 14:08.415
Just listen.

14:10.083 --> 14:12.152
Slow down!

14:12.185 --> 14:15.222
Hey, stop that man!
He stole my purse!

14:15.255 --> 14:17.290
Really?

14:17.324 --> 14:19.993
What are you so mad about?

14:20.027 --> 14:21.361
We're getting a table.

14:21.394 --> 14:23.196
We'll probably get
a free dessert.

14:23.230 --> 14:24.898
How could you embarrass
me like that?

14:24.932 --> 14:26.967
What's embarrassing?
It was working.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.501
You made me an
object of pity.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.503
Well, to get what
Napa Valley Monthly calls

14:30.537 --> 14:33.240
"the best bucatini
outside of Naples."

14:33.273 --> 14:35.075
Bonnie, I don't want
people to see me

14:35.108 --> 14:37.444
as different,
as "less than."

14:37.477 --> 14:39.412
You're not "less than."
You're damn right I'm not.

14:39.446 --> 14:42.182
But you wanted the maître d'
to feel sorry for us.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.117
I just thought
I could get a better table.

14:44.151 --> 14:45.485
Do you know
how hard I work

14:45.518 --> 14:48.288
for people not to see
me as a guy in a chair?

14:48.321 --> 14:50.223
I guess I-I don't
think about it

14:50.257 --> 14:52.325
because you make it
look so easy.

14:52.359 --> 14:54.361
Well, that's the way
that I want it to look.

14:54.394 --> 14:57.330
I don't cut in line, I don't
bitch when there's not a ramp,

14:57.364 --> 14:59.299
and I don't ask for
special treatment.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.369
Ever.

15:05.305 --> 15:10.210
No, you don't, and...
and I shouldn't have, either.

15:12.212 --> 15:15.182
I guess I don't think enough
about what you go through

15:15.215 --> 15:18.551
because I'm too busy
thinking about myself.

15:22.589 --> 15:26.326
I'm sorry, Adam.
I'm so, so sorry.

15:26.359 --> 15:32.032
She actually said,
"So, so sorry"?

15:32.065 --> 15:34.067
It surprised me, too.

15:36.069 --> 15:38.205
She just straight-up apologized?

15:40.207 --> 15:42.342
No blaming other people,

15:42.375 --> 15:44.244
no fake tears,

15:44.277 --> 15:47.047
no "I grew up
in the foster system.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.349
I slept in a dog bed
till I was 11."

15:51.151 --> 15:54.487
She even went back inside
and apologized to the maître d'.

15:54.521 --> 15:57.090
Wow.

15:57.124 --> 15:59.126
She really is changing.

15:59.159 --> 16:01.194
Well...
BONNIE:
Damn it, Christy!

16:01.228 --> 16:03.363
My bath is
getting cold!

16:03.396 --> 16:05.498
So turn the hot water on!

16:05.532 --> 16:07.367
I can't!
I'm reading!

16:08.635 --> 16:11.204
Just give her a second.

16:12.339 --> 16:14.207
Never mind!
I figured it out!

16:14.241 --> 16:16.043
I put the book down!

16:20.047 --> 16:21.614
WOMAN (over TV):
Don't avoid the world

16:21.648 --> 16:24.184
because of moderate
to severe plaque psoriasis.

16:24.217 --> 16:28.421
Do you have any idea
what plaque psoriasis is?

16:28.455 --> 16:32.192
Maybe it's when you get an award
for your psoriasis.

16:32.225 --> 16:34.294
Well, this guy has it,
and then he took this pill,

16:34.327 --> 16:36.229
and now he's having
the best day of his life.

16:36.263 --> 16:38.498
He's swimming,
he's making pottery.

16:38.531 --> 16:42.335
Hey, I kind of wish I had it.

16:42.369 --> 16:43.603
Ready for your lunch?

16:43.636 --> 16:45.605
I was ready 30 minutes ago.

16:45.638 --> 16:48.075
How long does it take you
to open a can?

16:48.108 --> 16:50.077
Actually, it's
not from a can.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.644
I made it from scratch.

16:51.678 --> 16:54.481
Really? What's that
floatin' in there?

16:54.514 --> 16:55.648
Vegetables.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.484
Ugh.

16:57.517 --> 17:00.053
Well, I'll choke it down.

17:00.087 --> 17:01.654
Bon appétit.

17:01.688 --> 17:04.424
What's with the smile?

17:04.457 --> 17:08.428
I'm just... happy
you're my mom.

17:08.461 --> 17:11.531
Why?

17:11.564 --> 17:13.633
You're so funny.

17:13.666 --> 17:15.568
Careful. It's hot.

17:15.602 --> 17:19.139
This unexpected pleasantness
is very unsettling.

17:19.172 --> 17:22.242
Can't a daughter just
be nice to her mother?

17:22.275 --> 17:24.611
Not this daughter,
not this mother.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.446
Well, you better
get used to it,

17:26.479 --> 17:28.281
because I love you
no matter what.

17:28.315 --> 17:30.417
Yeah, well, uh,

17:30.450 --> 17:33.420
I used the lost kid room
at Walmart for day care.

17:33.453 --> 17:35.422
That's okay.

17:35.455 --> 17:38.425
The security guard taught me
how to spell my name.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.593
What's that all about?

17:40.627 --> 17:42.429
Oh, Christy's acting
like she loves me,

17:42.462 --> 17:44.631
and it's really pissing me off.

17:44.664 --> 17:46.266
I love you, too.

17:46.299 --> 17:48.268
I will kick you with this boot.

17:55.542 --> 17:58.111
(whistling a tune)

17:58.145 --> 17:59.612
(door opens)
CHRISTY: Mom?

18:01.614 --> 18:03.616
(door closes)

18:06.553 --> 18:07.554
Hey.

18:07.587 --> 18:10.490
Hey.

18:10.523 --> 18:12.459
Weren't you supposed
to go to the doctor today?

18:12.492 --> 18:14.127
I did.

18:14.161 --> 18:16.329
Turns out he wants me
to stay off my feet

18:16.363 --> 18:18.398
another week just to be safe.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.267
Oh, no.

18:20.300 --> 18:23.203
I know. I'm so disappointed.

18:23.236 --> 18:25.205
I really hate being a burden.

18:25.238 --> 18:27.174
You're not a burden.

18:27.207 --> 18:28.541
Oh, thanks, honey.

18:28.575 --> 18:31.344
By the way,
there is a family of raccoons

18:31.378 --> 18:33.513
living in the wall of 5G.

18:35.182 --> 18:36.483
You're gonna need the gloves,

18:36.516 --> 18:38.485
and as cute
as you think the babies are,

18:38.518 --> 18:40.320
they will go
right for your eyes.

18:40.353 --> 18:42.655
I'm on it.

18:42.689 --> 18:45.192
Christy, wait.

18:45.225 --> 18:46.626
Yeah?

18:46.659 --> 18:48.595
There's something
I have to tell you.

18:51.198 --> 18:54.567
My laundry is really piling up.

18:54.601 --> 18:56.769
I'll take care of it.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.438
You're the best.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.240
By the way,

19:00.273 --> 19:02.242
you might want to
close that cabinet,

19:02.275 --> 19:04.211
you lying, worthless dirtbag.

19:07.414 --> 19:10.783
Don't tell Adam!
Don't tell Adam!
