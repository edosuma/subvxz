12:26.916 --> 12:28.916
the same shit that I went through,
with addiction,

12:29.000 --> 12:31.583
and so just sort of helping them out,
get them on their feet.

- [Karim] Yeah.

12:48.125 --> 12:49.708
I gotta go. Some work stuff popped up.

12:49.791 --> 12:51.434

tell us something.

[spits]

49:49.666 --> 49:51.541
[groans] Shit!

49:52.000 --> 49:55.000
[Shaft] Whoo! [grunts]

49:58.333 --> 50:00.500
- [horn honking]
- [JJ gasps]

50:00.583 --> 50:02.250
Jesus! My head is killing me.

50:02.375 --> 50:04.916
Oh, don't be that
whiny hangover guy, son.

50:05.000 --> 50:06.625
Nobody likes that guy, you know.

50:06.708 --> 50:08.416
Just frown, grab your head, and say,

50:08.500 --> 50:10.458
"Damn, I kicked it too hard last night.

50:10.541 --> 50:12.250
I am fucked up."

50:12.583 --> 50:14.500
That's the guy everybody
wants to hang with.

50:14.583 --> 50:17.458
- Oh, shit. Sasha.
- Thought you said she wasn't coming.

50:17.541 --> 50:18.875
She wasn't. But, you know,

50:18.958 --> 50:20.998
she's not exactly the type
to take no for an answer.

50:21.041 --> 50:22.708
Well, well, well.

50:23.041 --> 50:24.166
You must be Sasha.

50:24.250 --> 50:25.916
Yeah, literally just told him that.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.875
Uh... Yeah, I am, and who are you?

50:28.958 --> 50:32.541
This is the private detective
that I've been working with.

50:32.625 --> 50:34.875
He's also kind of my dad.

50:35.375 --> 50:36.375
[Shaft] Shaft.

50:36.666 --> 50:37.666
John Shaft.

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
[smooches]

50:39.750 --> 50:40.750
Wow.

50:40.958 --> 50:41.958
I'm sorry, I just...

50:42.041 --> 50:44.121
I wouldn't know what you look like
because, you know,

50:44.166 --> 50:45.916
you haven't shown up
for the last 25 years.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.250
- [JJ coughs]
- Oh, beautiful and fiery.

50:48.625 --> 50:49.958
What is he doing here, JJ?

50:50.375 --> 50:51.291
He's helping.

50:51.375 --> 50:52.250
Really?

50:52.375 --> 50:53.375
I doubt it.

50:53.916 --> 50:55.333
Okay. [laughs]

50:56.083 --> 50:57.625
Now that we're all acquainted...

50:57.708 --> 50:59.726
- I thought it was a good question.
- Yeah. I'm sure.

50:59.750 --> 51:01.583
- [JJ] Yeah...
- You okay?

51:01.916 --> 51:02.750
I'm just...

51:02.833 --> 51:04.583
I'm not feeling, um...

51:05.833 --> 51:09.541
Ah, damn, I kicked it too hard last night.
I'm fucked up.

51:09.625 --> 51:11.833
He took me out last night.
We blew off some steam.

51:11.916 --> 51:14.375
You should have seen
this motherfucker in the club.

51:14.458 --> 51:16.000
He was tearing it up.

51:16.083 --> 51:18.541
JJ, turning up on a Tuesday, huh?

51:18.625 --> 51:21.416
On a goddamn Tuesday.
Can you believe that?

51:21.500 --> 51:22.500
No.

51:22.583 --> 51:24.476
- Boy's got more Shaft than I thought.
- [grunts]

51:24.500 --> 51:27.375
Yeah, well, let's hope that there's
a prescription for that. Shall we?

51:27.458 --> 51:28.458
Yeah.

51:29.166 --> 51:31.333
[Shaft] Prescribe something
for them tight-ass jeans

51:31.416 --> 51:33.208
cutting off the blood to your brain.

51:33.416 --> 51:35.416
[indistinct chatter]

51:37.708 --> 51:40.791
This is not feeling
like a terrorist training ground.

51:41.125 --> 51:42.125
I still don't know.

51:44.250 --> 51:45.750
Is that the girl from the funeral?

51:45.833 --> 51:47.541
- That has to be Anam.
- Yeah.

51:48.208 --> 51:50.375
- [Sasha speaking Arabic]
- [woman speaking Arabic]

51:50.458 --> 51:51.333
May I help you?

51:51.416 --> 51:52.833
We'd like to talk to Anam.

51:53.666 --> 51:56.427
We didn't get a chance to meet,
but we're childhood friends with Karim

51:56.500 --> 51:58.583
and we'd really like
to ask you some questions.

52:00.916 --> 52:03.625
I met Karim not long after he returned
from the war.

52:04.125 --> 52:06.708
We didn't start dating
until early last year.

52:07.250 --> 52:08.500
That's when he got clean.

52:09.125 --> 52:10.583
Everything was so perfect.

52:10.708 --> 52:12.541
Did Karim have any enemies?

52:12.750 --> 52:14.291
Somebody want to do him harm?

52:14.375 --> 52:15.208
No.

52:15.291 --> 52:16.750
He had so much to live for.

52:17.875 --> 52:19.355
He was building our new youth center.

52:20.750 --> 52:21.750
Oh!

52:22.708 --> 52:23.958
[Shaft] Yeah, that's nice.

52:24.250 --> 52:25.930
- Any way we can look inside?
- [Farik] No!

52:26.541 --> 52:29.000
You may not.
This is highly inappropriate.

52:29.083 --> 52:31.392
- [Farik] You cannot speak to my daughter.
- Please excuse my father.

52:31.416 --> 52:32.833
You're father's Imam?

52:32.916 --> 52:34.083
Yes.

52:34.750 --> 52:36.875
Sir... Please excuse us.

52:36.958 --> 52:38.000
No. You must leave now.

52:38.083 --> 52:38.916
So...

52:39.041 --> 52:42.708
are you a Muslim from a Muslim country...

52:43.583 --> 52:47.666
or did you find Allah in some cell block?

52:48.541 --> 52:49.875
What did you say to me?

52:49.958 --> 52:52.083
Can we just calm down
for one second, please?

52:52.166 --> 52:54.083
[man] <i>Zakat? Zakat?</i>

52:54.958 --> 52:57.208
Yes. Yes. <i>Zakat.</i> How about a...

52:57.708 --> 52:59.500
a donation, as a sign of good faith?

52:59.583 --> 53:01.041
Hey, you got change for a 10?

53:01.125 --> 53:02.791
What is that? FBI?

53:02.958 --> 53:04.416
You are FBI.

53:04.500 --> 53:06.583
What? Where'd you get
that crazy idea from?

53:06.666 --> 53:08.500
Do I look like I'm in the FBI?

53:09.708 --> 53:11.208
Out! Out at once!

53:17.958 --> 53:18.958
Jeez.

53:20.541 --> 53:23.166
You know, I'm trying to give homeboy
the benefit of the doubt,

53:23.250 --> 53:25.083
but that motherfucker is annoying.

53:25.166 --> 53:28.166
I need to find out how much <i>zakat</i>
it's gonna take to build one of those.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.500
Oh, I'm thinking a shitload for sure.

53:32.583 --> 53:35.208
Only problem is, my laptop's
registered to the Bureau.

53:35.333 --> 53:37.093
I need to get to a computer
they can't trace.

53:37.125 --> 53:39.333
I got a computer you can use,
in my office.

53:40.458 --> 53:41.458
Whoa!

53:41.791 --> 53:42.875
Where'd you get a computer?

53:42.958 --> 53:44.333
I won it in a game show called

53:44.416 --> 53:47.576
"Beat the Shit Out of a Piece-of-Shit
Drug Dealer and You Get to Keep his Shit."

53:47.625 --> 53:48.500
Cute.

53:48.583 --> 53:51.083
So, I have a shift to catch
at the hospital.

53:51.166 --> 53:53.500
- I'm gonna talk to you later, okay?
- Okay. I'll call you.

53:53.583 --> 53:55.750
- Okay.
- Or, you know what, I can text you.

53:55.833 --> 53:57.750
Because we've got text history

53:57.833 --> 53:59.083
for days, so I can...

53:59.166 --> 54:01.791
Yeah. Get the thumbs working on that.

54:01.875 --> 54:04.250
Why the hell can't you young people
just talk to each other?

54:04.333 --> 54:05.166
Fuck a text.

54:05.250 --> 54:06.416
It's a phone. Call her.

54:06.500 --> 54:08.583
Or better yet, why don't you just
take her to dinner,

54:08.666 --> 54:10.291
and debrief her over the meal?

54:10.708 --> 54:11.708
[Sasha] Dinner?

54:12.291 --> 54:13.708
That actually sounds really nice.

54:14.541 --> 54:15.375
It does.

54:15.458 --> 54:16.875
Yeah. Yeah!

54:17.625 --> 54:19.666
- I'll call you about dinner.
- Awesome.

54:19.750 --> 54:21.041
- I'll talk to you later.
- Okay.

54:21.375 --> 54:22.375
Bye.

54:23.166 --> 54:24.166
[chuckles]

54:27.375 --> 54:28.500
All right, thanks.

54:30.750 --> 54:33.750
You got to stop being
so afraid of women, son.

54:34.208 --> 54:35.416
You know, women...

54:36.708 --> 54:38.333
want a man to be a man.

54:38.416 --> 54:40.166
They don't want some pussy.

54:40.250 --> 54:42.333
Well, some women want some pussy.

54:42.416 --> 54:44.291
And some women want both.

54:45.166 --> 54:46.833
That's my preference. But...

54:47.458 --> 54:50.541
in general, women want a man to be manly.

54:50.625 --> 54:51.833
[car door opens]

54:52.125 --> 54:53.125
[chuckles]

54:53.291 --> 54:54.333
[car door closes]

54:55.625 --> 54:58.666
I'm pretty sure women don't like
being told what it is that they like.

54:58.750 --> 55:00.416
See, that's the shit I'm talking about.

55:00.541 --> 55:02.083
Men used to be men.

55:02.166 --> 55:04.250
Now, you millennial motherfuckers
are running around

55:04.333 --> 55:07.500
worrying about what women think,
and how they feel,

55:07.583 --> 55:10.208
and apologizing and shit.
It's embarrassing.

55:10.291 --> 55:13.166
[chuckles] Apologizing is embarrassing?

55:13.250 --> 55:15.333
Yes. Men don't apologize.

55:15.416 --> 55:16.916
That's a trap they set for us.

55:17.000 --> 55:18.625
Real men just own their shit.

55:19.208 --> 55:22.583
No. Real men take responsibility
for what they do.

55:22.666 --> 55:24.826
Real men are strong enough to admit
when they're wrong.

55:24.875 --> 55:26.595
Real men are strong enough
to put their foot

55:26.666 --> 55:28.586
in a motherfucker's ass
when they get pissed off.

55:28.666 --> 55:30.375
What is that? The Shaft family motto?

55:30.458 --> 55:32.416
It's an unwritten rule, Stephen A.

55:33.041 --> 55:34.500
Shit. [grunts]

55:35.375 --> 55:37.791
- Who that?
- It's Ma.

55:38.625 --> 55:40.958
Do not tell her you're with me.

55:42.333 --> 55:43.625
[laughs] Oh!

55:44.125 --> 55:46.250
Look who's being a little bitch now.

55:46.333 --> 55:48.375
You're about to be the victim
of the unwritten rule.

55:48.458 --> 55:50.416
- Don't fuck around.
- Uh-huh.

55:51.208 --> 55:52.041
Hey, Ma.

55:52.125 --> 55:53.125
Hey, baby.

55:53.333 --> 55:54.375
I'm just checking in.

55:54.458 --> 55:57.208
Oh, you know what? I'm so, so happy

55:57.291 --> 55:58.666
that you called.

55:58.750 --> 56:02.125
Ma, you will not believe
who I've been hanging out with.

56:02.208 --> 56:03.208
[Maya] <i>Who?</i>

56:05.041 --> 56:06.041
Sasha.

56:06.250 --> 56:08.833
[Maya] <i>Aww, Sasha. I love her.</i>

56:08.958 --> 56:11.333
I'm so glad you two have each other
to get through this.

56:11.416 --> 56:13.208
- [Maya] <i>You tell her I say hi.</i>
- I will.

56:13.291 --> 56:16.101
Listen, I'd love to see you this weekend.
I'm coming into the city tonight

56:16.125 --> 56:17.416
- for a date.
- With who?

56:17.875 --> 56:19.416
Since when do you
care about me dating?

56:19.833 --> 56:21.625
No, you're right. Sorry, Ma.

56:21.750 --> 56:23.250
Forget I even said anything.

56:23.666 --> 56:24.666
[Maya] <i>He's picking me up</i>

56:24.750 --> 56:27.375
from the hotel and taking me
to this place called Trista's.

56:27.500 --> 56:28.500
Oh.

56:28.750 --> 56:29.666
Well, that's good.

56:29.750 --> 56:32.166
Well, just call me
when you get in town, all right?

56:32.250 --> 56:34.392
- I love you. Talk to you later.
<i>- </i> [Maya] <i>I love you, too, baby.</i>

56:34.416 --> 56:35.333
<i>- </i> [Maya] <i>Bye.</i>
- All right, bye.

56:35.416 --> 56:37.791
How many motherfuckers
your mom been with since me?

56:40.041 --> 56:41.333
Nine or ten maybe.

56:42.333 --> 56:43.958
[chuckles] Oh! So nothing serious.

56:44.041 --> 56:45.041
Cool.

56:45.916 --> 56:47.250
[tires squealing]

56:54.833 --> 56:57.000
Wait a minute.
If you don't use a computer,

56:57.083 --> 56:58.875
how do you keep track
of all your case files?

56:59.000 --> 57:00.000
I got a system.

57:04.333 --> 57:05.166
[JJ scoffs]

57:05.250 --> 57:06.333
Unbelievable.

57:06.416 --> 57:09.583
You have unlimited information
available to you in seconds,

57:09.666 --> 57:12.875
the tools to store
and to organize all your files.

57:12.958 --> 57:15.916
Graphics, music, HD porn,
and that's just...

57:16.000 --> 57:17.708
Whoa, whoa, whoa, HD porn?

57:18.541 --> 57:19.833
Can you hook that up to the TV?

57:20.958 --> 57:21.958
Music, too.

57:23.625 --> 57:24.708
[JJ typing]

57:26.416 --> 57:27.416
Whoa.

57:27.708 --> 57:29.416
All the mosque files are encrypted.

57:29.500 --> 57:31.625
Like... crazy encrypted.

57:31.708 --> 57:32.541
Shouldn't they be?

57:32.625 --> 57:34.583
[JJ] Yeah, if they're up to
some real shady shit.

57:34.666 --> 57:36.386
All right, I'm gonna
have to work some magic

57:36.458 --> 57:38.916
if I'm gonna have any chance
of phishing the quantum network

57:39.000 --> 57:42.041
and converging the endpoint
protection platforms to unlock this data.

57:42.583 --> 57:43.583
Yeah, okay.

57:44.125 --> 57:45.416
Well, you do what you do.

57:53.291 --> 57:54.291
[JJ] I'm in.

57:54.708 --> 57:56.000
Wait, come look at this.

57:56.083 --> 57:58.833
Five hundred thousand dollars
directly deposited

57:58.916 --> 58:02.708
to the cleric's personal account
from El Supemercado Fantastico.

58:02.833 --> 58:05.708
I've been in this neighborhood forever.
I ain't never heard of that one.

58:06.125 --> 58:08.083
Well, apparently, this one just opened up.

58:08.166 --> 58:09.666
A grocery store...

58:10.416 --> 58:13.666
gave a half million dollars
to the cleric, directly.

58:14.125 --> 58:15.208
[cell buzzing]

58:16.291 --> 58:17.291
Who that?

58:17.416 --> 58:18.416
It's my boss.

58:20.583 --> 58:21.625
Agent Vietti.

58:21.708 --> 58:23.458
[Vietti] Why am I looking at
an empty desk?

58:23.541 --> 58:24.934
[JJ on the phone] <i>I'm sorry.
You know that mosque?</i>

58:24.958 --> 58:26.291
I think I found some information.

58:26.375 --> 58:28.708
The one I specifically told you
to stay away from?

58:28.833 --> 58:30.892
- Well, yeah. I know, but...
- [Vietti] <i>You disobeyed a direct order.</i>

58:30.916 --> 58:33.708
You placed a highly classified
operation in jeopardy.

58:33.958 --> 58:36.416
Effective immediately,
you're on administrative leave.

58:36.500 --> 58:37.500
What?

58:38.041 --> 58:39.041
For how long?

58:39.125 --> 58:40.725
Till I think you know your fucking role!

58:40.750 --> 58:41.750
[cell beeps]

58:43.250 --> 58:44.458
Administrative leave.

58:44.541 --> 58:46.291
"Know my fucking role"?

58:46.375 --> 58:47.750
I'm the best analyst they've got.

58:47.833 --> 58:50.458
[chuckles] That's what you get
for working for the Man.

58:50.583 --> 58:51.583
[Shaft] So...

58:51.625 --> 58:53.250
you gonna stay on the porch...

58:53.625 --> 58:55.708
or you gonna come run
with the big dogs?

58:57.625 --> 58:59.125
We're going grocery shopping.

58:59.333 --> 59:00.666
[rap music playing]

59:00.750 --> 59:03.041
<i>♪ I wasn't youngy

59:03.291 --> 59:04.375
<i>♪ I was the fox ♪</i>

59:04.458 --> 59:06.142
<i>♪ I started talking
'Cause I knew I was the fox ♪</i>

59:06.166 --> 59:07.958

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
<i>♪ I knew was the fox ♪</i>

59:15.875 --> 59:17.083
Oh, my bad.

59:17.250 --> 59:18.375
Who the fuck are you?

59:18.458 --> 59:19.458
Who the fuck am I?

59:19.500 --> 59:20.416
<i>Puta cucaracha...</i>

59:20.500 --> 59:22.666
Oh! I'm sorry.

59:22.750 --> 59:24.625
He doesn't know how to properly
speak to women.

59:24.833 --> 59:26.000
We're just here...

59:26.625 --> 59:28.500
looking for the owner, Bennie.

59:29.375 --> 59:30.375
I'm Bennie.

59:31.583 --> 59:32.791
And again...

59:33.375 --> 59:34.791
who the fuck are you?

59:34.875 --> 59:36.875
Oh, could you give us one moment, please?

59:40.083 --> 59:42.041
Yo, what is wrong with you?

59:42.125 --> 59:43.416
She picked up a bat.

59:43.500 --> 59:45.900
So what're you gonna do?
You're gonna break her fingers, too?

59:45.958 --> 59:47.041
You can't beat up a woman.

59:47.125 --> 59:48.791
- Why not?
- Because she's a woman!

59:48.916 --> 59:50.625
That's like... misogynistic.

59:50.708 --> 59:53.250
You're the one being misogynistic.
I ain't mention no gender.

59:53.333 --> 59:55.333
You the one bringing up
her being a woman and shit.

59:55.416 --> 59:57.256
- I don't give a fuck about her gender.
- Okay.

59:57.333 --> 59:58.833
I'm an equal opportunity ass-whooper.

59:58.916 --> 01:00:01.041
Okay, just... Can I handle this?

01:00:01.833 --> 01:00:02.833
Thank you.

01:00:04.416 --> 01:00:05.416
Hi, Bennie.[chuckles]

01:00:05.625 --> 01:00:07.250
We don't want any trouble. You know,

01:00:07.333 --> 01:00:09.500
we just came to ask you
just a couple of questions.

01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:11.958
- [JJ] Oh!
- Damn!

01:00:12.041 --> 01:00:14.208
[JJ groaning]

01:00:15.041 --> 01:00:17.541
I was just trying to talk. [moans]

01:00:18.125 --> 01:00:20.458
Now, my son says I can't put hands on you

01:00:20.541 --> 01:00:22.083
'cause you're a woman.

01:00:22.166 --> 01:00:24.041
Now, since I can't whoop your ass,

01:00:24.666 --> 01:00:26.541
I'm gonna have to beat the shit...

01:00:27.041 --> 01:00:28.208
out of your shit.

01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:29.875
[JJ groaning]

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.416
What the fuck?

01:00:31.541 --> 01:00:34.125
Oh, there's no non-violent people
in Harlem?

01:00:34.208 --> 01:00:35.208
Junior.

01:00:35.250 --> 01:00:37.250
Oh, damn, she's strong.

01:00:37.375 --> 01:00:38.708
I think she's ready to talk.

01:00:38.791 --> 01:00:40.291
Oh, it's bleeding.

01:00:41.083 --> 01:00:42.083
[groans]

01:00:42.250 --> 01:00:43.166
You know this guy?

01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:44.500
<i>Se parece a un come mierda...</i>

01:00:46.208 --> 01:00:47.208
English, please.

01:00:47.291 --> 01:00:49.708
The boy speaks Mexican, not Puerto Rican.

01:00:50.625 --> 01:00:51.458
No.

01:00:51.541 --> 01:00:53.000
What about a guy named Farik?

01:00:54.416 --> 01:00:57.125
Oh, oh! So you do know Farik.

01:00:57.208 --> 01:00:59.916
Well, let's talk about
that 500k you sent

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.708
Farik and his friends at the mosque.

01:01:01.791 --> 01:01:04.041
Hey. You better find
a whole new answer or something,

01:01:04.166 --> 01:01:05.886
because he's running out
of things to shoot.

01:01:08.041 --> 01:01:10.333
The mosque is a staple of the community.

01:01:10.625 --> 01:01:13.750
Supermercado is proud
to support all groups.

01:01:13.833 --> 01:01:15.791
- Really?
- Really.

01:01:17.416 --> 01:01:18.458
Hey, you remind me...

01:01:19.958 --> 01:01:20.958
Bennie.

01:01:21.583 --> 01:01:24.375
Have you and me...

01:01:24.625 --> 01:01:27.083
ever done the... horizontal boogie?

01:01:29.208 --> 01:01:30.208
No, <i>papi.</i>

01:01:30.583 --> 01:01:33.750
I'd remember fucking a black guy
dressed like Morpheus from <i>Matrix.</i>

01:01:34.416 --> 01:01:35.416
[laughs]

01:01:37.041 --> 01:01:38.791
<i>Coño!</i> That shit was ostrich!

01:01:38.875 --> 01:01:39.958
I don't give a fuck.

01:01:40.166 --> 01:01:41.333
What was that for?

01:01:41.416 --> 01:01:44.458
I'm sick of these Laurence Fishburne
comparisons. It's just getting old.

01:01:44.916 --> 01:01:45.916
Oh.

01:01:46.916 --> 01:01:48.625
You know what? [sighs]

01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:49.916
We're gonna leave you alone.

01:01:50.291 --> 01:01:51.333
Yippee.

01:01:52.041 --> 01:01:54.541
<i>Hasta la vista...</i> Bennie.

01:01:58.458 --> 01:02:00.666
I meant to say that shit
like Schwarzenegger.

01:02:00.791 --> 01:02:02.191
[JJ] Oh, yeah. You gotta be deeper.

01:02:02.583 --> 01:02:03.583
[Shaft] <i>Hasta la vista.</i>

01:02:04.833 --> 01:02:06.458
<i>I know I've seen</i>

01:02:06.541 --> 01:02:08.708
Bennie somewhere before.

01:02:08.875 --> 01:02:11.458
I ain't sure she wasn't lying
about me tapping that ass.

01:02:11.541 --> 01:02:12.821
You've gotta be kidding me, man.

01:02:12.875 --> 01:02:15.458
You're never gonna find anything
on her in this mess.

01:02:15.583 --> 01:02:16.583
Ta-da!

01:02:18.333 --> 01:02:19.333
No way.

01:02:21.041 --> 01:02:22.041
How'd you just do that?

01:02:22.083 --> 01:02:23.375
I told you, I got a system.

01:02:23.583 --> 01:02:26.166
This is my "Puerto Ricans
I don't trust" file.

01:02:27.250 --> 01:02:29.875
You literally have
a racist-based catalog system?

01:02:30.291 --> 01:02:31.541
Ain't that how the FBI does it?

01:02:32.666 --> 01:02:33.750
Yeah, pretty much.

01:02:33.833 --> 01:02:35.958
God-motherfucking-damn!

01:02:36.083 --> 01:02:37.083
Got her!

01:02:37.916 --> 01:02:39.333
Oh, shit. That's Bennie!

01:02:39.916 --> 01:02:40.916
[Shaft] Mm-hm.

01:02:41.125 --> 01:02:42.405
Who's this dude that she's with?

01:02:42.458 --> 01:02:46.000
That is Pierro "Gordito" Carrera.

01:02:46.083 --> 01:02:48.000
He's been the head of Las Caras boys,

01:02:48.083 --> 01:02:49.708
you know, the baddest gang up in Harlem,

01:02:49.791 --> 01:02:51.125
since like forever.

01:02:51.208 --> 01:02:52.416
Those motherfukers

01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:55.340
were the ones responsible for bringing
crack into the hood in the '80's.

01:02:55.416 --> 01:02:57.916
Now, they're the reason
45's talking about

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.916
[hoarse voice] "an opioid epidemic."

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.083
But what I can't figure out,
is what business

01:03:03.166 --> 01:03:06.541
a motherfucker like this
has got with a mosque.

01:03:06.666 --> 01:03:09.625
Maybe Supermercado Fantastico
is just a front

01:03:09.708 --> 01:03:11.375
for the Las Caras' drug money.

01:03:12.625 --> 01:03:13.785
You know, they could be using

01:03:13.833 --> 01:03:15.500
the cleric's mission trips

01:03:15.583 --> 01:03:17.916
over to Afghanistan to bring in heroin.

01:03:18.875 --> 01:03:20.976
Karim probably found out about it,
and they killed him

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.226
because he was gonna
blow the whistle on the whole thing.

01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:24.708
That's very, very possible.

01:03:24.791 --> 01:03:28.458
Damn. I can't wait to push this
in Vietti's stupid face.

01:03:28.541 --> 01:03:29.416
No, no, no, no.

01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:31.208
We're gonna solve this shit ourselves.

01:03:31.875 --> 01:03:33.708
Then, I tell you the Shaft way

01:03:33.791 --> 01:03:36.000
to tell that dick head boss of yours
to kiss your ass.

01:03:36.083 --> 01:03:40.291
- No, that's... that's what I meant.
- But first, we gotta put eyes on Bennie.

01:03:40.416 --> 01:03:41.666
So we can get some proof.

01:03:42.208 --> 01:03:43.833
So, I'mma go out, get some coffee,

01:03:44.458 --> 01:03:47.250
a bunch of Papaya dogs, and we gonna do
an old-fashioned stakeout.

01:03:47.333 --> 01:03:49.208
How about we don't do anything

01:03:49.291 --> 01:03:50.708
that starts with "old-fashioned"?

01:03:51.333 --> 01:03:52.208
[JJ] I...

01:03:52.291 --> 01:03:55.000
planted a micro-cam on Bennie's desk.

01:03:59.666 --> 01:04:00.500
Hm.

01:04:00.583 --> 01:04:03.291
So, you know, we can watch the footage
back tomorrow morning.

01:04:03.416 --> 01:04:04.583
Take the night off, Big Dog.

01:04:05.291 --> 01:04:07.125
I'mma go get dressed
for dinner with Sasha.

01:04:07.208 --> 01:04:08.333
Hanging out with Mom after.

01:04:08.416 --> 01:04:11.333
Why the fuck would you be
hanging out with your mom after,

01:04:11.416 --> 01:04:13.833
when you should be knee-deep in pussy?

01:04:13.916 --> 01:04:14.916
Knee-deep?

01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:17.375
I don't even know what direction the...

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:19.958
You know what? Nevermind. You're right.

01:04:20.041 --> 01:04:22.601
I don't know where in the world
I would be without your fatherly wisdom.

01:04:22.625 --> 01:04:24.875
[laughs] Better late than never.

01:04:24.958 --> 01:04:25.958
[chuckles]

01:04:26.833 --> 01:04:28.291
Go tear that ass up, son.

01:04:29.250 --> 01:04:30.583
Oh, you wanna use my car?

01:04:31.125 --> 01:04:32.605
No, I don't have no driver's license.

01:04:33.041 --> 01:04:34.083
Me, neither.

01:04:35.291 --> 01:04:36.958
And, son, remember.

01:04:38.333 --> 01:04:41.250
It's your duty... to please that booty.

01:04:42.541 --> 01:04:43.541
[chuckles]

01:04:45.416 --> 01:04:47.041
Give her the Shaft, Big Boy.

01:04:48.250 --> 01:04:49.250
This is crazy.

01:04:49.416 --> 01:04:52.666
You're telling me that the cleric
and this gang are working together?

01:04:52.750 --> 01:04:54.892
Yeah, it was hard for me
to believe that at first, too.

01:04:54.916 --> 01:04:57.166
Even if any of this is true,
why would Karim

01:04:57.250 --> 01:04:59.017
- have anything to do with it?
- [JJ] I don't know,

01:04:59.041 --> 01:05:00.250
but I'mma find out.

01:05:00.333 --> 01:05:02.625
And when I do,
whoever killed him is gonna be sorry.

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:05.166
Starting to sound a lot like your dad.

01:05:06.250 --> 01:05:07.250
What?

01:05:07.541 --> 01:05:08.541
Are you serious?

01:05:08.583 --> 01:05:09.416
Hm-hm.

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:13.333
You motherfucking think I sound
like that goddamn motherfucker?

01:05:13.416 --> 01:05:14.416
[chuckles]

01:05:17.625 --> 01:05:19.625
He's actually really funny, though.

01:05:19.708 --> 01:05:22.916
And you should see the way the people
in Harlem react to him. He's like...

01:05:23.333 --> 01:05:24.541
a legend. [chuckles]

01:05:24.625 --> 01:05:27.166
Well, I mean, I'm happy your dad's funny,

01:05:27.250 --> 01:05:28.601
but it doesn't make up for the fact

01:05:28.625 --> 01:05:32.000
that he abandoned you when you were a baby
and wanted nothing to do with you.

01:05:33.166 --> 01:05:34.250
All right. Look.

01:05:36.083 --> 01:05:38.333
[sighs] He's obviously...

01:05:38.916 --> 01:05:39.833
screwed up.

01:05:39.916 --> 01:05:41.125
Borderline insane.

01:05:41.208 --> 01:05:44.166
But, deep down, I feel like
he's actually an okay dude.

01:05:45.041 --> 01:05:46.125
Don't get me wrong.

01:05:47.625 --> 01:05:51.250
There's no way that I'm just gonna forget
that he abandoned me as a kid.

01:05:53.333 --> 01:05:54.333
Okay.

01:05:54.875 --> 01:05:56.875
[indistinct chatter]

01:05:58.166 --> 01:05:59.166
Hi.

01:05:59.250 --> 01:06:00.333
[mumbles]

01:06:00.791 --> 01:06:03.708
- Would you like me to take your coat?
- Oh, sure. Thank you.

01:06:04.083 --> 01:06:06.875
Ooh, lookie here.
Will someone call <i>Ripley's,</i>

01:06:06.958 --> 01:06:09.541
'cause this woman
is too beautiful to be believed.

01:06:09.625 --> 01:06:11.583
[giggles] Thank you so much.

01:06:11.666 --> 01:06:13.506
Well, you know,
you don't look so bad yourself.

01:06:13.583 --> 01:06:15.476
- Well, you know, I do what I do.
- [Maya chuckles]

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:18.083
...goddamn pants on. You L.T.

01:06:18.708 --> 01:06:20.208
You're a Super Bowl hero.

01:15:15.833 --> 01:15:17.708
Another shipment from Afghanistan.

01:15:18.458 --> 01:15:20.666
Say anything about Gordito being there?

01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:22.541
Um... No.

01:15:22.625 --> 01:15:24.976
But between this and the bank statements,
that's more than enough

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.333
evidence to tie the Las Caras gang

01:15:27.416 --> 01:15:28.541
to the cleric, right?

01:15:28.625 --> 01:15:29.500
So what's next?

01:15:29.583 --> 01:15:32.250
We go back up
to the Supermercado Fantastico

01:15:32.333 --> 01:15:33.833
and bust some heads open?

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.125
You know, now...

01:15:39.833 --> 01:15:43.541
just might be the right time
to turn the case over to the FBI.

01:15:44.041 --> 01:15:45.041
What?

01:15:45.666 --> 01:15:47.666
Wait, what happened to solving
this shit ourselves?

01:15:47.708 --> 01:15:48.708
You did!

01:15:48.791 --> 01:15:51.958

01:15:52.791 --> 01:15:53.958

Are you sure about that?

01:16:00.208 --> 01:16:01.208
Yeah.

01:16:01.791 --> 01:16:02.958
Oh, yeah, I'm sure.

01:16:07.916 --> 01:16:09.708
JJ... Are you okay?

01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:14.708
So Maya and John Shaft
have a baby together. [chuckles]

01:16:15.083 --> 01:16:17.583
You know, they say
that cat Shaft is a bad mother...

01:16:17.666 --> 01:16:18.750

You know, for him to just automatically
assume we're Islamophobic,

01:16:57.958 --> 01:17:00.458

When I first came to you about Karim,

01:18:19.791 --> 01:18:22.791
the first thing that crossed your mind
wasn't that it could lead to Gordito?

01:18:25.166 --> 01:18:26.916
Yeah, that's exactly what I thought.

01:18:27.333 --> 01:18:28.684
[JJ] But now you got what you needed.

01:18:28.708 --> 01:18:31.541
You can abandon me again and go ahead
and follow him now, right?

01:18:31.625 --> 01:18:32.708
What am I supposed to do?

01:18:32.791 --> 01:18:37.208
Hm? Dominguez is a trained soldier,
who's apparently not afraid to kill.

01:18:37.291 --> 01:18:40.000
And Gordito is the most dangerous
motherfucker in the city.

01:18:41.291 --> 01:18:42.666

01:18:49.791 --> 01:18:51.541
I am your father.

01:18:51.625 --> 01:18:55.416
No, you had a choice between being
my father and being Shaft.

getting close, Bennie got popped,

No. Fuck that, man.

01:24:50.958 --> 01:24:52.351
We need to turn ourselves in right now.

01:24:52.375 --> 01:24:55.666
You know, you're really starting
to sound a lot like Karim.

01:24:56.458 --> 01:24:57.625
And look where that got him.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.934
It's gonna break Bennie's heart when I
tell her that her cousin was a snitch.

01:25:01.958 --> 01:25:04.291
What the hell's that supposed
to mean, Cutty? [grunts]

01:25:05.750 --> 01:25:06.750
It means...

01:25:07.250 --> 01:25:09.166
I'm not gonna let loose ends
mess this up.

01:25:09.750 --> 01:25:10.875
That's what it means.

01:25:11.583 --> 01:25:13.708
I mean did you think
that we should turn ourselves in?

01:25:13.791 --> 01:25:14.791
Huh? Did you?

01:25:15.250 --> 01:25:16.250
[grunts]

01:25:18.041 --> 01:25:18.958
Fuck! My phone!

01:25:19.041 --> 01:25:19.958
Shit!

01:25:20.041 --> 01:25:21.041
[grunts]

01:25:21.208 --> 01:25:23.541
It's that Shaft kid.
He saw everything.

01:25:25.250 --> 01:25:26.250
Get him!

01:25:34.583 --> 01:25:35.583
[groans]

01:25:36.250 --> 01:25:37.250

01:25:39.375 --> 01:25:40.375
Come on!

01:25:40.458 --> 01:25:41.916
[groans, grunts]

01:25:45.958 --> 01:25:46.958

01:26:12.041 --> 01:26:14.000
The phone. Now!

01:26:14.583 --> 01:26:15.708
Not gonna ask again!

01:26:17.250 --> 01:26:18.517
[Sasha] Don't give it to him, JJ!

01:26:18.541 --> 01:26:20.333
- [grunts]
- Hey, stop.

01:26:20.791 --> 01:26:22.833
Come on.
Put it on the ground.

01:26:22.916 --> 01:26:24.500
- [Sasha grunting]
- [Cutty] Now!

01:26:24.958 --> 01:26:26.291

- Junior! Get in the car!

01:26:44.541 --> 01:26:46.375
- [Sasha grunts]
- Oh, shit!

01:26:47.041 --> 01:26:48.041
Oh!

01:26:53.458 --> 01:26:54.458
[yelling] JJ!

01:26:55.333 --> 01:26:56.458
[yelling] Sasha!

01:26:58.833 --> 01:27:01.041
Let's go! Hurry!

01:27:01.541 --> 01:27:02.541
I'm in. Go, go!

01:27:02.958 --> 01:27:04.000
[tires squealing]

01:27:05.833 --> 01:27:06.958
[Sasha yelling] JJ!

01:27:13.250 --> 01:27:15.208
[groans] Ah.

01:27:22.333 --> 01:27:24.666
That motherfucker's got to die.

01:27:30.666 --> 01:27:32.166
We need to go find Sasha.

01:27:32.291 --> 01:27:33.750
Can't the FBI handle that?

01:27:34.916 --> 01:27:37.000
You just don't think that I can do this.

01:27:37.083 --> 01:27:40.041
Look, I know the only person
that you give a fuck about is Gordito.

01:27:40.125 --> 01:27:41.208
But I can't lose her.

01:27:41.291 --> 01:27:42.791
And I can't lose you.

01:27:43.666 --> 01:27:46.583
Do you wanna know why
I want Gordito so badly?

01:27:47.250 --> 01:27:50.833
That motherfucker's the reason our family
got torn apart in the first place.

01:27:51.250 --> 01:27:52.291
Now, he came for me,

01:27:52.375 --> 01:27:54.291
your mom was in the car.
So were you.

01:27:54.375 --> 01:27:55.666
You were just a baby.

01:27:56.041 --> 01:27:57.583
I can't let that shit go.

01:27:58.125 --> 01:27:59.375
But you know what?

01:28:00.666 --> 01:28:03.958
Fuck Gordito if it means
I lose my son again.

01:28:05.833 --> 01:28:07.753
I didn't come here looking
for that motherfucker.

01:28:07.833 --> 01:28:09.166
I came here looking for you.

01:28:12.041 --> 01:28:13.041
Thanks.

01:28:15.791 --> 01:28:16.791
I'm glad you came.

01:28:18.333 --> 01:28:20.375
I'm actually a little impressed
that you found me.

01:28:20.458 --> 01:28:23.708
I keep telling you I know way more
about this city than that GPS shit.

01:28:25.416 --> 01:28:27.833
You know what? I think I can
track Sasha's phone.

01:28:28.958 --> 01:28:30.333
I just gotta get to a computer.

01:28:30.416 --> 01:28:31.958
I got you. Officer Thomas!

01:28:32.041 --> 01:28:33.161
[Shaft] Let me holla at you.

01:28:35.833 --> 01:28:36.833
What is it, Shaft?

01:28:36.916 --> 01:28:39.396
You got something you wanna tell me
about this little shitstorm

01:28:39.458 --> 01:28:40.976
- that blew through here?
- [Shaft mumbles]

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:41.833
No.

01:28:41.916 --> 01:28:44.416
But my son needs to book a flight.

01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:46.041
You mind if he uses your computer?

01:28:47.375 --> 01:28:48.375
Book a flight.

01:28:48.833 --> 01:28:49.833
Mm-hm.

01:28:54.541 --> 01:28:56.666
[JJ] So Cutty was running the drugs.

01:28:56.750 --> 01:28:58.208
Gordito was selling them.

01:28:58.375 --> 01:28:59.833
And Bennie was laundering the money.

01:28:59.916 --> 01:29:02.041
[woman] Excuse me...
I'm sorry. Do y'all

01:29:02.125 --> 01:29:03.125
want some mints?

01:29:03.250 --> 01:29:06.125
[woman] Charge your cell phone?
Y'all need some music...

01:29:06.208 --> 01:29:07.500
No, thank you. We're good.

01:29:07.583 --> 01:29:09.726
All right, if you need something,
you just let me know.

01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:11.833
- I got it all right here for you, okay?
- Okay.

01:29:11.916 --> 01:29:13.208
So, I figure

01:29:13.291 --> 01:29:15.625
Dominguez was using Cutty as a pawn,

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.833
to get in the gang
with Bennie and Gordito.

01:29:18.916 --> 01:29:20.125
Did you say "Gordito"?

01:29:20.208 --> 01:29:21.888
Ain't that like a big burrito
or something?

01:29:21.916 --> 01:29:23.083
Say what?

01:29:23.166 --> 01:29:24.208
[woman] Shit is good.

01:29:24.333 --> 01:29:25.791
When the other Brothers found out,

01:29:25.875 --> 01:29:27.500
then Cutty tried to just cut him in,

01:29:27.583 --> 01:29:28.642
but Karim wouldn't go for it.

01:29:28.666 --> 01:29:30.146
[woman] Hey, speaking of the Kareems,

01:29:30.208 --> 01:29:33.048
why come y'all think it is that Jabbar
don't get the credit he deserves?

01:29:33.083 --> 01:29:34.791
He scored more points than Jordan,

01:29:34.875 --> 01:29:36.083
- LeBron...
- Babycakes.

01:29:36.166 --> 01:29:37.434
- Mm?
- In case you ain't noticed,

01:29:37.458 --> 01:29:39.833
we're trying to work some shit out
back here, all right?

01:29:39.916 --> 01:29:43.041
You just having a conversation
out loud, so I thought I could be in it.

01:29:43.125 --> 01:29:44.000
[woman] My bad.

01:29:44.125 --> 01:29:46.208
Now, that still don't explain the mosque.

01:29:46.291 --> 01:29:48.051
Well, maybe when Karim
didn't take the money,

01:29:48.166 --> 01:29:51.125
they tried to just make him happy
by having Bennie forward his amount

01:29:51.208 --> 01:29:52.083
to the cleric.

01:29:52.166 --> 01:29:54.666
Right. That way, the cleric wouldn't know
the money was dirty.

01:29:54.750 --> 01:29:55.750
Yeah, but I don't think

01:29:55.791 --> 01:29:57.625
that Karim could live
with knowing the truth,

01:29:57.708 --> 01:29:59.268
and Cutty couldn't have any loose ends,

01:29:59.333 --> 01:30:00.416
so their only option...

01:30:00.958 --> 01:30:01.998
- Kill Karim.
- Kill Karim.

01:30:02.041 --> 01:30:02.958
[woman gasps]

01:30:03.041 --> 01:30:05.291
- Y'all want to kill Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?
- [JJ] No!

01:30:05.375 --> 01:30:08.125
But I'm about to kill you,
if you don't mind your damn business

01:30:08.208 --> 01:30:09.288
and drive this fucking car.

01:30:09.750 --> 01:30:10.833
[chuckles]

01:30:11.541 --> 01:30:12.791
If we gonna take on Las Caras,

01:30:12.875 --> 01:30:14.791
we're gonna need a lot more firepower.

01:30:14.875 --> 01:30:16.555
I know just the motherfucker
to hook us up.

01:30:17.083 --> 01:30:20.541
Look here, sweetheart. I need to
change the address we're going to.

01:30:20.791 --> 01:30:21.875
Oh, you talking to me now?

01:30:21.958 --> 01:30:24.638
I don't actually need to know.
You just need to put it into the app.

01:30:24.666 --> 01:30:25.833
Put it in the what?

01:30:25.916 --> 01:30:27.250
Yeah, I'll take care of it.

01:30:27.333 --> 01:30:29.375
How come I couldn't just tell her
where we're going?

01:30:48.750 --> 01:30:49.583
No doorbell?

01:30:49.666 --> 01:30:50.976
[Shaft] He don't believe in those.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
- Just bang on the door on your left.
- [JJ] Okay.

01:30:53.083 --> 01:30:54.875
[Shaft] You know,
on second thought, fuck it.

01:30:56.958 --> 01:30:59.166
This motherfucker never locks his door.

01:31:01.166 --> 01:31:02.666
Yo, where you at?

01:31:03.083 --> 01:31:04.833
<i>But I'm not an alcoholic. I'm a drunk.</i>

01:31:06.583 --> 01:31:09.041
<i>Alcoholic gotta go
to them goddamn meetings.</i>

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.375

01:31:13.958 --> 01:31:14.833
Pop?

01:31:14.916 --> 01:31:15.916
It's me.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.000

01:31:18.416 --> 01:31:19.666
Wait. Grandad?

01:31:19.750 --> 01:31:21.208
No, it can't be.

01:31:22.416 --> 01:31:23.583
Damn. You look like shit.

01:31:23.750 --> 01:31:24.750

01:31:24.833 --> 01:31:27.166
How could you look 20 years older
than my gray ass?

01:31:27.250 --> 01:31:28.833
Yeah, it's good to see your ass, too.

01:31:29.625 --> 01:31:30.625
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:31:32.125 --> 01:31:33.125
Wow.

01:31:34.958 --> 01:31:36.208
You're my grandson?

01:31:37.583 --> 01:31:39.267
I haven't been able to see you
since your daddy

01:31:39.291 --> 01:31:42.041
drove your light-skinned ass
way the hell upstate.

01:31:42.416 --> 01:31:44.583
Only you could be
a worse father than I was.

01:31:44.666 --> 01:31:46.583
- You were a wonderful father.
- Hm-hm.

01:31:46.666 --> 01:31:48.386
After you stopped pretending
to be my uncle.

01:31:49.250 --> 01:31:50.250
Wait, what?

01:31:50.625 --> 01:31:51.750
Don't pay attention to him.

01:31:51.833 --> 01:31:54.333
Come over here
and give your granddaddy some love.

01:31:54.958 --> 01:31:56.208
[John and JJ laughs]

01:31:56.291 --> 01:31:57.291
Y'all hungry?

01:31:57.875 --> 01:31:59.125
- Want some grits?
- Yeah.

01:31:59.208 --> 01:32:00.583
Grits? What's that?

01:32:01.291 --> 01:32:02.333
It's a long story.

01:32:03.541 --> 01:32:06.000
- Look, I need to ask you a favor.
- What you need?

01:32:06.083 --> 01:32:07.083
You still packing?

01:32:07.125 --> 01:32:08.333
[chuckles] "Still packing".

01:32:08.416 --> 01:32:10.958
Boy, back in the day, we didn't need guns.

01:32:11.041 --> 01:32:13.125
[John] All we needed
was our bare knuckles.

01:32:13.208 --> 01:32:14.625
Oof. Old school.

01:32:14.708 --> 01:32:16.108
- Okay. [chuckles]
- [John chuckles]

01:32:17.625 --> 01:32:19.375
But you can't be too prepared.

Oh, yeah.

01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:22.875
What the hell?

01:32:25.333 --> 01:32:26.333
Damn!

Grandpa!

01:32:28.625 --> 01:32:30.291
Yo, what don't you have?

01:32:34.625 --> 01:32:35.625
So, what's the gig?

01:32:36.041 --> 01:32:38.875
Oh, drug kingpin, military scandal,

You know, the usual.

01:32:43.041 --> 01:32:44.250
Usual shit. Yeah.

used to help you with your homework?</i>

01:32:55.125 --> 01:32:57.085
Thanks, Pops. I'm gonna get
this shit back to you.

01:32:57.166 --> 01:32:58.375
Wait, wait, wait. Hold up.

01:32:58.458 --> 01:33:01.916
You think I'm just gonna give you my shit
and let you have all the fun without me?

01:33:02.125 --> 01:33:03.875
Hell, no. I'm coming with you.

01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:06.333
You sure?

01:33:06.416 --> 01:33:09.250
Damn right, I'm sure.
I'm bored as hell up in here.

01:33:10.125 --> 01:33:11.125
All right.

01:33:11.416 --> 01:33:12.500
Let's go get your girl.

01:33:12.583 --> 01:33:14.458
Yeah. Let's get Gordito's ass.

01:33:44.875 --> 01:33:47.955
I don't know, man. I do not like her
just sitting there without restraints on.

[man humming, gasps]

01:34:30.666 --> 01:34:32.306
- Can I help you gentlemen?
- [John] Yeah.

01:34:32.333 --> 01:34:35.416
I was telling my boys here,
that even at my age...

01:34:36.250 --> 01:34:37.125
I could take you.

01:34:37.208 --> 01:34:39.833
Come on, Pop. Ain't you got
something better to do?

01:34:39.916 --> 01:34:41.916
Sound like to me
he's calling you out, homes.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:43.500
That is... unless you're scared.

01:34:43.583 --> 01:34:44.416
Scared? [mutters]

01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:45.833

01:35:00.458 --> 01:35:02.916
I bet if we were wrestling

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:03.875
he might have won.

01:35:03.958 --> 01:35:07.375
Not regular fries. For some chili
cheese fries, he'd kick your ass.

01:35:07.458 --> 01:35:08.833
[JJ] Hey, we're in luck.

01:35:08.916 --> 01:35:10.833
That penthouse is using

for the lobby and the elevator.

01:35:12.416 --> 01:35:14.851
I'mma just go ahead and create a loop,
and I can use my phone.

01:35:14.875 --> 01:35:17.515
A loop. Is that where they don't see us
when we're on the elevator?

01:35:17.583 --> 01:35:20.476
- Exactly. See, you're learning.
- That shit don't never work in the movies.

01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:21.666

Hmm. Quality is perfect.

01:35:42.625 --> 01:35:44.666
As always, it has been a pleasure

01:35:44.750 --> 01:35:46.416
doing business with you.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.083

[beeps]

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.333
- So they can't see us?
- [JJ] Oh, 100%.

01:36:02.541 --> 01:36:05.625
The only thing that they're gonna see
is the feed I uploaded. We're invisible.

01:36:05.708 --> 01:36:06.875
Boy's got skills.

01:36:07.791 --> 01:36:08.791

Does that "uh-oh" mean
the movie shit is happening?

01:36:18.125 --> 01:36:22.708

- Do we have Wi-Fi?

01:36:25.166 --> 01:36:26.291
No.

01:36:26.791 --> 01:36:28.000
So they can see us.

01:36:28.083 --> 01:36:31.083
I mean, there's still a chance
that this is working. Hang on. Let me...

01:36:31.166 --> 01:36:32.208

I'm the cop that broke up
your little ghetto crack cartel,

I can't believe you actually
took a bullet for me.

01:43:27.958 --> 01:43:31.791
Oh, man. Shit was happening so fast.
It's like...

01:43:32.625 --> 01:43:33.666
No, and I tripped.
