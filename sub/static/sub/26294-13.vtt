WEBVTT

00:04.308 --> 00:06.354
- I love my Truck boys,

00:06.397 --> 00:08.269
but what I need these days
is quality female time.

00:08.312 --> 00:10.401
- I think I'm going to stay
with Severide for a while.

00:10.445 --> 00:12.099
He'd never admit it

00:12.142 --> 00:14.014
but he needs someone
looking after him.

00:14.057 --> 00:16.016
- I will be having drinks
with the good doc

00:16.059 --> 00:17.756
at The Aviary.

00:17.800 --> 00:20.498
I had a great time
with you last night,

00:20.542 --> 00:23.588
but I'm not really looking
for anything serious.

00:24.502 --> 00:26.113
What's he doing here?

00:26.156 --> 00:28.071
- You didn't invite him?

00:28.115 --> 00:30.465
- I'm not giving up so easy.

00:36.688 --> 00:38.386
- It's not right out there,

00:38.429 --> 00:41.128
I need a radiator
and a coffee, stat.

00:41.171 --> 00:42.607
- Ah, come on.
It's not that bad.

00:42.651 --> 00:44.218
My first year on the job,

00:44.261 --> 00:45.784
there was this big ice storm
that was so cold,

00:45.828 --> 00:47.308
the rigs didn't even start.

00:47.351 --> 00:49.049
- So you're saying
there's still time for me

00:49.092 --> 00:50.528
to get out of here
and take a job down in Miami

00:50.572 --> 00:52.356
or Bermuda?
- No, don't joke!

00:52.400 --> 00:54.141
I already lost one partner
at the Caribbean.

00:54.184 --> 00:55.359
I'm not about to lose
another one.

00:56.839 --> 00:58.406
- What's that?

00:58.449 --> 01:00.538
- I keep getting these calls
from a blocked number.

01:00.582 --> 01:02.453
Three times a day, no messages.

01:02.497 --> 01:04.412
- Telemarketers found you.

01:07.676 --> 01:09.373
- Where'd you visit?

01:09.417 --> 01:11.419
- Oh, I can't remember
how many.

01:11.462 --> 01:14.117
I must've toured, you know,
half a dozen campuses

01:14.161 --> 01:15.771
in two days.

01:15.814 --> 01:18.687
State schools, private schools,
liberal arts whatsits.

01:18.730 --> 01:21.385
Anyway, Lee Henry has
a few notions

01:21.429 --> 01:23.387
about where he wants to go

01:23.431 --> 01:25.215
but I ain't buying.

01:25.259 --> 01:28.523
I found out that
his first pick is ranked as

01:28.566 --> 01:30.525
a grade A party school.

01:30.568 --> 01:32.744
- Yeah, well,
college is supposed to be fun.

01:32.788 --> 01:34.703
- I know my kid's idea of fun

01:34.746 --> 01:37.358
and there is no way that I am
taking out a second mortgage

01:37.401 --> 01:39.577
so that he could major
in beer pong.

01:39.621 --> 01:41.144
- Wait, wait, wait.
That was an option?

01:41.188 --> 01:43.277
Well,
I went to the wrong school.

01:44.495 --> 01:46.106
Hey, can I get in on that?

01:50.501 --> 01:52.199
- Fun night?

01:52.242 --> 01:55.593
-  Oh yeah, um,
I went out dancing

01:55.637 --> 01:57.334
with a couple
of academy buddies,

01:57.378 --> 02:00.294
it got real dumb in
the best possible way.

02:03.297 --> 02:04.820
- Okay, everybody,

02:04.863 --> 02:07.605
registrations for the
Polar Plunge is now open.

02:07.649 --> 02:09.433
Who's in with me?
- Awesome!

02:09.477 --> 02:10.782
I've been wanting
to do that for years,

02:10.826 --> 02:12.306
I always end up on shift.

02:12.349 --> 02:13.916
- Yeah, well, this year
we are all clear

02:13.959 --> 02:15.831
and they have a special section
for city services.

02:15.874 --> 02:17.398
I was gonna sign us all up
as a group.

02:17.441 --> 02:18.747
- Count me in.

02:18.790 --> 02:20.227
- I should already be
in the system

02:20.270 --> 02:22.142
under the
Bucktown Winter Walrus Club.

02:22.185 --> 02:23.273
- Hey, what's all this?

02:23.317 --> 02:24.579
- Oh, it's a big charity event.

02:24.622 --> 02:26.189
Basically, you jump into
Lake Michigan.

02:26.233 --> 02:28.800
- In February.
You're joking.

02:28.844 --> 02:30.280
For why?

02:30.324 --> 02:31.325
- I just said,
for charity.

02:31.368 --> 02:32.804
- For crazy, you mean.

02:32.848 --> 02:34.371
- Oh, what do you say,
Foster?

02:34.415 --> 02:36.634
Do you wanna jump in
with the rest of us?

02:36.678 --> 02:39.681
- Seriously,
I love you folks, truly.

02:39.724 --> 02:40.812
It's a hard no.

02:40.856 --> 02:42.684
You guys are loco.

02:44.860 --> 02:46.427
- Engine 51, Ambo 61.

02:46.470 --> 02:48.820
Structure fire,
99 North Racine.

02:48.864 --> 02:51.736
Main to 51,
Engine 111 is on the scene.

02:51.780 --> 02:53.608
Position yourself
to cover Charlie side

02:53.651 --> 02:55.653
with a defensive line
on your arrival.

02:55.697 --> 02:58.830
- Copy that!
We're only a few blocks away!

02:58.874 --> 03:01.398
Ambo 61 is right behind us.

03:05.359 --> 03:06.664
- Would you look at that?

03:06.708 --> 03:08.449
What's this joker think
he's doing?

03:10.015 --> 03:11.495
- So he's trying
to cut through traffic

03:11.539 --> 03:12.844
by riding our wake.

03:14.759 --> 03:17.197
- I'm gonna give him
a blast of the horn.

03:20.896 --> 03:22.680
- Not budging.

03:22.724 --> 03:26.641
- All right, I gotta call CPD,
give this guy a ticket.

03:30.645 --> 03:32.908
You know, people got this
notion that--

03:32.951 --> 03:34.301
- Whoa!

03:52.188 --> 03:53.189
- All right, Ritter!

03:53.233 --> 03:55.017
- Yeah?
- Stretch a hose

03:55.060 --> 03:57.324
and get ready to douse this
engine on my signal,

03:57.367 --> 03:59.282
but hold off
until I get a good look.

03:59.326 --> 04:00.892
- Yes, Lieutenant.

04:08.987 --> 04:10.902
Hey, can you hear me?

04:16.778 --> 04:19.041
- All right,
Engine 51 to Main,

04:19.084 --> 04:21.478
we're at Wabash and Harrison.

04:21.522 --> 04:23.872
Just got involved
in a collision.

04:23.915 --> 04:25.743
A guy, uh,
clipped us from behind,

04:25.787 --> 04:27.136
swerved into a parked car.

04:27.179 --> 04:29.051
Uh, looks like
the driver is pinned in,

04:29.094 --> 04:30.748
we only got manual tools.

04:30.792 --> 04:32.184
So we're gonna need
a truck company

04:32.228 --> 04:34.143
to help with the extrication.

04:34.186 --> 04:36.232
- Copy that, 51.
- Please...

04:36.276 --> 04:39.061
Am I gonna die?

04:39.104 --> 04:41.150
- Hold on, son.
Don't try to talk, we got you.

04:41.193 --> 04:42.282
We just need some time.

04:43.457 --> 04:45.720
- Lieutenant, we got a leak!

04:45.763 --> 04:47.374
Should I spray it with
the fog line?

04:47.417 --> 04:49.506
- No, no, no, no, no. It's
only gonna spread the problem.

04:49.550 --> 04:52.335
51 to Main,
where's that truck company?

04:52.379 --> 04:54.816
- Truck 68 is en route
from quarters.

04:54.859 --> 04:56.513
ETA is five minutes.

04:56.557 --> 04:59.124
- All right, to hell with it.
We'll work with what we got.

04:59.168 --> 05:01.344
- What, you're going in there?

05:01.388 --> 05:02.824
This could light up
at any second.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.260
- Just stay back,
all right?

05:04.304 --> 05:06.828
You keep that fog line
trained on me.

05:06.871 --> 05:10.788
If this thing flashes, you
blast me right in the chops.

05:10.832 --> 05:12.268
- Yes, sir.

05:16.316 --> 05:19.928
All right, listen.
Easy, easy.

05:19.971 --> 05:21.408
Stay with me, you hear?

05:21.451 --> 05:27.283
All right, we need you to be
focused on staying alive.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.417
I can get you back home
to your folks, okay?

05:30.460 --> 05:34.159
- Please--am I gonna die?

05:37.946 --> 05:39.861
- We're here!
- Stay clear!

05:39.904 --> 05:41.993
We got a fuel leak.

05:42.037 --> 05:43.778
- I almost got him.

05:43.821 --> 05:45.083
Come on.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.435
- Let's get you out.
Let's go.

05:48.478 --> 05:50.524
Hey, I need a hand-off!

05:50.567 --> 05:52.003
- Copy that, Lieutenant.

05:52.047 --> 05:53.527
- Okay.

05:53.570 --> 05:56.399
He's got trauma to his head
and his neck, no collar.

05:56.443 --> 05:57.400
Be careful with him!

05:57.444 --> 05:59.359
- Got him.
Watch his head.

06:01.970 --> 06:03.537
- I've got him.

06:05.321 --> 06:06.453
- Herrmann!

06:09.369 --> 06:10.935
- All right, go now!

06:13.242 --> 06:15.113
Got it?
- Yeah!

06:15.157 --> 06:16.898
- All right.

06:18.987 --> 06:20.510
- I feel crepitus.

06:20.554 --> 06:23.470
He has subcutaneous emphysema,
we got to intubate.

06:23.513 --> 06:24.558
- I'm already on it.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.520
- Oh, I know, I know.
Just relax.

06:31.869 --> 06:33.393
- Hey, is he all right?

06:33.436 --> 06:35.264
- Well, he's semiconscious
and has a gag reflex,

06:35.307 --> 06:37.179
it's causing him
to resist the intubation.

06:37.222 --> 06:39.268
- Come on, buddy,
be strong, all right?

06:39.311 --> 06:41.096
Help the medics do their job.

06:41.139 --> 06:43.185
- It's--it's not working.
He's going to vomit.

06:43.228 --> 06:45.448
- We need to push etomidate
and sedate him now.

06:45.492 --> 06:46.928
- We don't have that
in our Regional system.

06:46.971 --> 06:49.017
-  Seriously?

06:49.060 --> 06:51.062
Okay, we improvise.
20 milligrams of versed,

06:51.106 --> 06:52.977
that'll be enough
to relax the muscle

06:53.021 --> 06:54.109
and get the tube in, right?

06:54.152 --> 06:55.545
- It's outside of our protocol.

06:55.589 --> 06:57.634
We'll need telemetry approval
from a physician.

06:57.678 --> 06:59.375
Here, I'll call.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.377
- How long is he gonna take?

07:07.252 --> 07:09.167
- I'm good to go now.

07:09.211 --> 07:10.952
Your call.

07:14.564 --> 07:16.436
- No, you're right.
You should go for it.

07:25.401 --> 07:28.665
All right,
let's see if the tube's in.

07:35.716 --> 07:37.413
I'm in.

07:39.154 --> 07:41.069
- All right.

07:41.112 --> 07:42.679
Thanks.

07:42.723 --> 07:45.421
- Lieutenant.
- Yeah.

07:45.465 --> 07:48.163
- Got a little ding
on the bumper, nothing major.

07:48.206 --> 07:49.512
- All right,

07:49.556 --> 07:52.689
I'll call it in when
we get back to quarters.

07:52.733 --> 07:54.561
Guys, let's clean this mess up!

07:54.604 --> 07:57.085
Come on, let's go.
- Got it.

08:06.181 --> 08:08.270
- Psst, yo.

08:08.313 --> 08:11.099
Ready for this?

08:11.142 --> 08:13.928
Friend of mine over at 48
snuck us some VIP passes

08:13.971 --> 08:16.278
to the rescue equipment expo
tomorrow.

08:16.321 --> 08:19.281
Get a first look at some of
the new technical rescue stuff.

08:19.324 --> 08:20.630
Figure we'd check it out

08:20.674 --> 08:24.025
then swing by Molly's
to catch the Blackhawks.

08:24.068 --> 08:25.374
- Or...

08:27.507 --> 08:31.162
Stay with me here,
we do none of that

08:31.206 --> 08:32.599
and have a night out instead.

08:33.774 --> 08:35.340
When was the last time
you and I hit the town

08:35.384 --> 08:37.081
on a Friday night?

08:38.430 --> 08:40.258
- Get back in the game.

08:44.262 --> 08:45.525
Sold.

08:48.615 --> 08:50.094
- You going somewhere?

08:50.138 --> 08:51.966
- Yeah, outside.

08:52.009 --> 08:54.316
No hat, no jacket.

08:54.359 --> 08:57.275
Look, if I'm doing this
plunge, I'm going all out

08:57.319 --> 08:58.668
and I start prepping today.

09:01.497 --> 09:03.325
- You make it sound like
a challenge.

09:03.368 --> 09:05.240
- No, no not at all.

09:05.283 --> 09:07.242
Look, if you guys are too
chicken to handle the elements,

09:07.285 --> 09:10.158
I promise I will not think less
of you.

09:10.201 --> 09:13.509
- Huh, I see you, Kidd.
I see you.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.598
- Wait, is this something we're
all doing?

09:15.642 --> 09:18.035
Is--is there a vote?

09:18.079 --> 09:19.471
Guys!

09:22.387 --> 09:24.651
We're grabbing lunch outside
for some reason.

09:24.694 --> 09:27.349
- Great, good stuff.

09:27.392 --> 09:29.525
I'll meet you out there.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.396
- You okay?

09:31.440 --> 09:33.355
- Uh, yeah, yeah.

09:33.398 --> 09:36.401
It's just a load of paperwork
from the last call, you know?

09:37.751 --> 09:41.189
Figures,
teenager smashes his car

09:41.232 --> 09:43.800
into our backside,
we pull him out,

09:43.844 --> 09:45.759
and I'm the one
that's got to explain it.

09:47.674 --> 09:49.371
No good deed, am I right?

09:49.414 --> 09:50.764
- Sure.

09:58.423 --> 10:00.295
- What if you got, like,
a wetsuit or something?

10:00.338 --> 10:01.644
Help keep you warm.

10:01.688 --> 10:03.385
- Brett, I don't even
like going in the water

10:03.428 --> 10:04.647
in the summertime.

10:04.691 --> 10:06.518
Way I see it,
if the Lord meant for me

10:06.562 --> 10:07.824
to use that lake to swim,

10:07.868 --> 10:10.479
he wouldn't have invented
the booze cruise.

10:10.522 --> 10:13.438
Damn, I could've sworn
I left my charger in here.

10:15.310 --> 10:17.573
- Where's everybody going?
- Lunch.

10:19.706 --> 10:21.403
- Okay.

10:21.446 --> 10:23.100
I'm gonna see what
that's all about.

10:23.144 --> 10:25.233
- Enjoy, I'm gonna check
my car real quick.

10:25.276 --> 10:26.538
See you in a bit.

10:26.582 --> 10:28.149
- Hey guys, what's going on?

10:30.238 --> 10:31.413
- Oh!

10:31.456 --> 10:32.632
- Oh, God.

10:32.675 --> 10:34.416
- Sorry, I didn't mean
to startle you.

10:34.459 --> 10:36.636
- What are you doing here?
- I'm just checking in.

10:36.679 --> 10:39.682
It's been about a week,
I've given you some space.

10:39.726 --> 10:41.466
I thought I'd just swing by
and see how you feel

10:41.510 --> 10:42.859
about giving things
another shot.

10:42.903 --> 10:46.254
Maybe, uh,
dinner tomorrow night?

10:46.297 --> 10:47.690
- You asked me already.

10:47.734 --> 10:49.431
- I know

10:49.474 --> 10:51.738
and I know that you weren't
really into it at the time

10:51.781 --> 10:53.522
but I just...

10:53.565 --> 10:55.176
like I said,
I don't give up so easy.

10:55.219 --> 10:57.439
- Wait,
have you been calling me,

10:57.482 --> 11:01.399
like, from an unlisted number?

11:01.443 --> 11:03.750
- I don't think so.

11:03.793 --> 11:07.231
Anyway, look, there is
this fantastic Italian spot.

11:07.275 --> 11:10.452
It's on East Grand,
it's got a great wine list.

11:10.495 --> 11:12.106
It's old school Chicago.

11:12.149 --> 11:16.284
- Yeah, Jim, I--I'm just
not feeling it, okay?

11:17.502 --> 11:20.114
Nothing's changed

11:20.157 --> 11:21.506
and just so you're aware,

11:21.550 --> 11:24.466
I don't find any
of this romantic or cute.

11:24.509 --> 11:28.688
So please,
asking nicely, back it up.

11:28.731 --> 11:32.213
- Oh, oh, yeah.
Heard loud and clear.

11:32.256 --> 11:34.519
Sorry to get in your space.

11:36.304 --> 11:39.742
But just--for what it's worth.

11:41.744 --> 11:43.790
I think you're making
a huge mistake.

11:48.316 --> 11:50.666
But that's your prerogative,
right?

12:00.632 --> 12:02.852
- All right, a little bit more
and we'll be all good.

12:02.896 --> 12:04.767
- Where'd you find this thing?

12:04.811 --> 12:06.856
- Oh, it's, uh, in storage,
it's an old hazmat recon pool.

12:06.900 --> 12:08.728
It's perfect, right?

12:08.771 --> 12:11.121
- Oh, might've been a little
more perfect in July or August,

12:11.165 --> 12:12.557
but hey.

12:12.601 --> 12:14.864
Okay, that should be good.

12:14.908 --> 12:16.257
Who wants to go in first?

12:17.824 --> 12:21.653
- I just had lunch,
should wait at least an hour.

12:21.697 --> 12:23.655
- Come on, you guys,
if we can't deal with this

12:23.699 --> 12:25.179
how are we gonna handle
Lake Michigan?

12:25.222 --> 12:26.833
- Guys, get this.

12:26.876 --> 12:29.618
I've been texting with my
cousin from Krasnoyarsk.

12:29.661 --> 12:32.795
It turns out he's a
professional ice swimmer!

12:32.839 --> 12:35.580
- That is 100% something
you just made up.

12:35.624 --> 12:38.061
- No, no, it's true.
I swear to God.

12:38.105 --> 12:40.672
Anyway, I told him what
we were doing

12:40.716 --> 12:43.066
and his advice,
first and foremost,

12:43.110 --> 12:46.069
was to focus
on breathing techniques.

12:46.113 --> 12:48.245
Apparently,
most people don't know this

12:48.289 --> 12:51.901
but the heart is the body's
most important source of heat,

12:51.945 --> 12:56.036
and so, if we were
to learn how to breathe

12:56.079 --> 12:58.821
and activate the heat
in our hearts...

12:58.865 --> 13:00.301
- Should I reign this in?

13:00.344 --> 13:01.911
- Not until you take a turn.

13:03.739 --> 13:05.741
- Listen, I was thinking
about tomorrow night.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.874
Thought we could hit some
of our old stomping grounds.

13:07.917 --> 13:09.832
Joe's on Weed Street,
the Red Ivy.

13:09.876 --> 13:11.138
- Sports bars?

13:11.181 --> 13:12.966
- Why? What were you thinking?

13:13.009 --> 13:14.750
- Something else.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.926
- Like what?

13:16.970 --> 13:19.059
- You'll see.

13:19.102 --> 13:20.321
- Oh.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.943
- Hey, Herrmann.

13:33.987 --> 13:35.815
Just got a call from
headquarters

13:35.858 --> 13:38.121
wanting a debrief
on the accident.

13:38.165 --> 13:39.819
You got the
incident report there?

13:39.862 --> 13:41.777
- Yep, proofing it now.

13:43.866 --> 13:45.259
Should I be concerned?

13:45.302 --> 13:47.304
- No, not at all.
- All right.

13:47.348 --> 13:50.655
- The victim's family is in
contact with the department,

13:50.699 --> 13:52.309
they're appreciative
of all our efforts.

13:52.353 --> 13:54.137
This is just good housekeeping.

13:54.181 --> 13:56.313
- Yeah.

13:56.357 --> 13:58.707
- Thanks.

13:58.750 --> 14:00.796
- Wasn't anything I could do.

14:02.363 --> 14:04.844
The way he was riding our wake,

14:04.887 --> 14:08.804
you know, there wasn't a half
a car length between us.

14:08.848 --> 14:12.112
- Hey,
you saved the boy's life.

14:14.462 --> 14:16.072
- Yeah.

14:17.769 --> 14:20.294
Bonehead kids.

14:20.337 --> 14:24.428
Been keeping us in business
since time began, right?

14:24.472 --> 14:26.735
- Yeah.

14:37.267 --> 14:39.182
- Hey, there you are.

14:39.226 --> 14:40.444
What are you doing heading out
in here?

14:40.488 --> 14:43.143
- I was just trying to rest.

14:43.186 --> 14:45.885
- Well, you are missing out.

14:45.928 --> 14:48.017
Cruz set up the kiddie pool
filled with cold water,

14:48.061 --> 14:50.846
they're timing each other and
no one's lasted five seconds.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.065
It's worth checking out.

14:52.108 --> 14:55.024
- Yeah, I can imagine, um...

14:55.068 --> 14:56.417
I think I'm just gonna read.

14:58.245 --> 14:59.768
- Are you okay?

15:06.427 --> 15:09.517
You should consider
coming to the plunge,

15:11.040 --> 15:12.912
even if you don't go in.

15:14.478 --> 15:16.916
I know you like your space,

15:16.959 --> 15:18.918
I totally respect that.

15:18.961 --> 15:22.922
I do, but...

15:22.965 --> 15:28.405
being a part of 51, it goes
beyond what we do on the calls.

15:28.449 --> 15:31.278
We show up for each other,
on and off shift.

15:33.323 --> 15:37.806
That might sound like something
people just say but not here.

15:37.849 --> 15:40.417
Not in Boden's firehouse.

15:40.461 --> 15:42.898
- Main to Ambo 61.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.945
- P.I.C. Brett.

15:45.988 --> 15:47.337
- Got a call from Lakeshore,

15:47.381 --> 15:50.166
non-emergency,
asking you to check in.

15:50.210 --> 15:52.125
- Copy that.

16:05.312 --> 16:06.922
Ambo 61?

16:06.966 --> 16:09.490
- Yes. I'm Sylvie Brett,
this is Emily Foster.

16:09.533 --> 16:11.883
- Dr. Alan Buchner,
I'm the representative

16:11.927 --> 16:15.148
for the EMS Medical Consortium
here at Lakeshore.

16:15.191 --> 16:16.453
Can we talk for a moment?

16:16.497 --> 16:19.891
- Of course, uh,
what is this about?

16:19.935 --> 16:21.850
- Please.

16:23.156 --> 16:24.592
I want you both to know

16:24.635 --> 16:28.552
that I've invited you here
as a courtesy.

16:28.596 --> 16:32.513
You have a right to know
that an anonymous complaint

16:32.556 --> 16:34.558
has been filed against you.

16:34.602 --> 16:38.301
- Uh, hold on.
What--what kind of complaint?

16:38.345 --> 16:40.477
- Apparently there's a pattern
of concern

16:40.521 --> 16:43.480
about the state of care
your patients are receiving

16:43.524 --> 16:46.266
prior to their arrival in
our Emergency Department.

16:46.309 --> 16:48.007
- Due respect, Doctor,

16:48.050 --> 16:49.617
I've been delivering patients
here for years.

16:49.660 --> 16:52.228
Foster trained as a medical
resident in this hospital.

16:52.272 --> 16:54.230
We are more than qualified--

16:54.274 --> 16:56.015
- Be that as it may,

16:56.058 --> 16:58.408
the complaints I've received
are serious enough to warrant

16:58.452 --> 17:01.498
professional oversight of
your run sheets moving forward,

17:01.542 --> 17:04.284
as well as a comprehensive
review of your calls

17:04.327 --> 17:06.373
for the past five months.

17:06.416 --> 17:10.072
- In other words,
since I arrived at Ambo 61.

17:10.116 --> 17:11.291
Am I right?

17:11.334 --> 17:14.076
- I understand your concern.

17:14.120 --> 17:17.340
It's never easy to face
a charge like this,

17:17.384 --> 17:20.256
but the fact is
that all CFD paramedics

17:20.300 --> 17:24.260
operate on a license
granted by the EMS Consortium

17:24.304 --> 17:26.349
of the State of Illinois.

17:26.393 --> 17:30.962
If we feel there's cause,
we will revoke it.

17:38.883 --> 17:41.582
- I think you're
making a mistake.

17:41.625 --> 17:43.671
Those were his exact words,
there is no doubt in my mind

17:43.714 --> 17:45.107
Dr. Shaw is
the one doing this to us.

17:45.151 --> 17:47.109
- Why didn't you notify me?

17:47.153 --> 17:50.808
- And what was
I supposed to say, Chief?

17:50.852 --> 17:55.248
I mean, yeah, it was upsetting,
but I thought it was over with.

17:55.291 --> 17:56.597
That he'd got it out
of his system.

17:56.640 --> 17:59.600
I never expected for him
to go this far.

17:59.643 --> 18:01.515
- So what are our options?

18:01.558 --> 18:03.430
Can we appeal to the CFD?

18:03.473 --> 18:05.171
- It's not a department matter.

18:05.214 --> 18:07.390
We don't have jurisdiction
over medical licensing.

18:07.434 --> 18:10.567
- Shaw knew that, no doubt.

18:10.611 --> 18:13.440
That's why he went the route
he went because he's got pull.

18:13.483 --> 18:15.311
I'll bet the EMS board
doesn't even know

18:15.355 --> 18:16.573
they're being played by him.

18:16.617 --> 18:19.707
- Oh, they will.
I'll see to it.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.839
I may not have any authority
over your licensing

18:21.883 --> 18:24.451
but I'm not about to let you
be the target of harassment.

18:26.757 --> 18:29.456
Hang tight.

18:29.499 --> 18:31.197
I'll take care of it.

18:33.329 --> 18:35.766
- Thank you, Chief.

18:35.810 --> 18:37.464
We appreciate it.

18:47.822 --> 18:50.346
- I owe you an apology.

18:51.652 --> 18:53.480
- Why?

18:53.523 --> 18:55.656
- Because you don't deserve
to get caught up in my drama.

18:55.699 --> 18:57.310
- Neither do you.

18:57.353 --> 18:59.442
Foster, trust me, I would
never hold you responsible

18:59.486 --> 19:01.879
for the actions of some jerk.

19:01.923 --> 19:03.838
Besides, it comes with
the territory

19:03.881 --> 19:05.622
of being
Paramedic in Charge.

19:05.666 --> 19:06.971
We're in it together.

19:07.015 --> 19:08.582
What goes for you,
goes for me.

19:08.625 --> 19:10.192
Full stop.

19:11.541 --> 19:13.674
- Not every PIC
would see it like that.

19:14.762 --> 19:16.198
Means a lot.

19:17.721 --> 19:20.289
- I got your back,
we all do.

19:28.384 --> 19:29.951
- Guys!

19:29.994 --> 19:31.866
What's with the steam?

19:32.736 --> 19:34.390
- What?

19:34.434 --> 19:37.263
- Are we training
or are we training?

19:38.873 --> 19:41.571
- Okay, all right,
we can do that.

19:41.615 --> 19:43.443
- Wait,
you're both going all cold?

19:43.486 --> 19:45.662
- Oh yeah, all cold, baby.
- Oh yeah!

19:50.493 --> 19:51.755
- Oh, this is not right!

19:56.673 --> 19:58.284
- Thanks.

20:00.808 --> 20:02.679
When you said it was
a nightclub in Canaryville,

20:02.723 --> 20:03.898
I thought you were joking.

20:03.941 --> 20:05.247
- Nah,
it's just for the weekend.

20:05.291 --> 20:06.509
It's a pop up.

20:06.553 --> 20:07.902
- A what?

20:07.945 --> 20:09.425
- Hey!

20:09.469 --> 20:11.035
Wrong way.

20:15.475 --> 20:16.780
What's up, man?

20:16.824 --> 20:18.391
- What's up, my man?
It's been a minute.

20:18.434 --> 20:19.740
- Yeah, I know.

20:19.783 --> 20:21.568
Uh, good friend, Matt,
fellow firefighter.

20:21.611 --> 20:23.526
- Cool, I got you.
- All right, thanks.

20:24.745 --> 20:26.268
What's up?

20:37.714 --> 20:39.455
Right?

20:39.499 --> 20:40.935
- Yeah.

20:40.978 --> 20:42.502
- I'll grab us a table.

20:42.545 --> 20:44.068
- Okay.

20:55.645 --> 20:57.995
- You look lost.

20:58.039 --> 20:59.954
- Me?

20:59.997 --> 21:02.826
I--I--I'm not really much
of a club guy.

21:02.870 --> 21:04.393
It's an adjustment.

21:04.437 --> 21:05.916
- Well, let's help you adjust.

21:05.960 --> 21:08.919
Going for a classic or one
of our specialty drinks?

21:08.963 --> 21:11.748
- Such as?
- Chili hibiscus la paloma.

21:11.792 --> 21:14.098
Trust me on this,
I won't steer you wrong

21:15.361 --> 21:16.710
- Hit me.

21:22.368 --> 21:23.369
Thank you.

21:40.037 --> 21:43.345
- So describe this training,
what exactly are you doing?

21:43.389 --> 21:44.781
- Oh, training is not really
the right word.

21:44.825 --> 21:46.653
It's more like, uh,
physical conditioning.

21:46.696 --> 21:49.046
Helping our bodies to adapt
to the elements

21:49.090 --> 21:50.961
so that we're prepared
for whatever we're facing

21:51.005 --> 21:52.485
on the day of the plunge.

21:52.528 --> 21:54.617
- Like Navy SEALs.
- Like Navy SEALs.

21:54.661 --> 21:56.140
- Ah, okay.

21:56.184 --> 21:59.013
Well, that's commitment.
I'll give you that, Cruz.

21:59.056 --> 22:00.928
- Well, I hate to burst
your bubble,

22:00.971 --> 22:04.540
but none of what you're doing
is actually gonna help.

22:05.889 --> 22:07.500
- What?

22:07.543 --> 22:09.153
- Yeah, Cruz, the body can't
adapt its ability

22:09.197 --> 22:10.633
to regulate temperature.

22:10.677 --> 22:12.374
It does not work like that.

22:13.549 --> 22:16.683
- Then why are we freezing our
butts off taking cold showers?

22:32.133 --> 22:34.178
- Uh-oh.
- Yeah.

22:34.222 --> 22:36.659
I met with Dr. Buchner,
it did not go well.

22:38.182 --> 22:41.882
Dr. Buchner been reviewing
your run sheets.

22:41.925 --> 22:44.058
There was a concern about

22:44.101 --> 22:46.843
the car accident from
last shift, the teenager.

22:46.887 --> 22:48.671
- What about it?

22:48.715 --> 22:50.499
When we brought him in,
he was in as good a condition

22:50.543 --> 22:52.806
as anyone could've hoped for
considering the circumstance.

22:52.849 --> 22:54.155
- No one is disputing that.

22:54.198 --> 22:56.897
Their concern involves
your decision

22:56.940 --> 23:01.031
to use a medication beyond the
parameters of its intended use.

23:01.075 --> 23:03.512
- The versed.
- That's my understanding.

23:03.556 --> 23:05.862
They're saying it requires
prior approval.

23:05.906 --> 23:08.561
- A--any doctor worth
their salt would've--would've

23:08.604 --> 23:10.650
given a green light without
a second thought.

23:10.693 --> 23:12.173
- Well, apparently,

23:12.216 --> 23:14.480
one of their physicians
on staff disagrees.

23:14.523 --> 23:16.133
- Shaw.

23:16.177 --> 23:18.658
- He didn't say, but--

23:18.701 --> 23:21.748
Look, without evidence
of harassment,

23:21.791 --> 23:23.967
it is your word against his.

23:25.621 --> 23:28.885
- I know exactly
who they're going to trust.

23:56.826 --> 23:58.175
- Turn it off.

23:58.219 --> 24:00.874
- Huh?

24:00.917 --> 24:02.789
Dad!

24:02.832 --> 24:05.661
- What'd you do to your car?

24:05.705 --> 24:07.489
The back bumper?

24:07.533 --> 24:09.622
- What?
- There's a dent!

24:09.665 --> 24:11.624
-  That happened,
like, two months ago.

24:11.667 --> 24:12.973
I was backing out
of a garage--

24:13.016 --> 24:14.496
- And you weren't
paying attention.

24:14.540 --> 24:16.672
Were you futzing
with the radio?

24:16.716 --> 24:19.153
Talking on the phone
to your friends?

24:19.196 --> 24:20.894
- No, Dad, I swear I was--

24:20.937 --> 24:22.112
- Gimme the keys!

24:22.156 --> 24:23.505
You lost
your driving privileges.

24:23.549 --> 24:24.767
Your mother can take
you to school

24:24.811 --> 24:26.073
for the rest of the year.

24:26.116 --> 24:28.031
- That's nuts.
- Go get your keys!

24:34.734 --> 24:36.170
- What happened?

24:38.607 --> 24:41.001
- Do you know what he did
to his car?

24:41.044 --> 24:44.744
- Yes, two months ago.
He barely--

24:44.787 --> 24:48.225
- Yeah, how does it make
a difference when it happened?

24:48.269 --> 24:50.053
- Christopher,
lower your voice.

24:51.881 --> 24:55.189
You can't keep coddling him,
Cindy.

24:55.232 --> 24:57.539
He is gonna be out there
in the world soon,

24:57.583 --> 25:00.107
he's gonna be getting in
God-knows-what kind of trouble

25:00.150 --> 25:02.675
'cause he figures that
somebody will always be there

25:02.718 --> 25:04.198
to bail him out,

25:04.241 --> 25:08.158
but I swear, one day
he's gonna screw up in a way

25:08.202 --> 25:10.334
that he can't take back

25:10.378 --> 25:14.034
and if you keep making excuses
for him,

25:14.077 --> 25:15.862
that's on you.

25:41.148 --> 25:42.497
- You good?

25:42.541 --> 25:44.630
- Uh, not completely broken

25:44.673 --> 25:47.284
but certainly
in need of repair.

25:48.547 --> 25:51.071
- One for the record books.

25:51.114 --> 25:53.116
- It's good to find my limits.

25:53.160 --> 25:56.076
Had a blast,
of course, but...

25:56.119 --> 25:58.339
obviously we can't keep
carrying on the way we used to

25:58.382 --> 26:00.515
when we were fresh out
of the academy, right?

26:00.559 --> 26:03.344
- Hey Kelly, mind grabbing me
a glass too?

26:03.387 --> 26:04.563
- Yeah, sure.

26:11.308 --> 26:12.701
- Sorry, you were saying?

27:11.281 --> 27:12.413
- Can I help you?

27:12.456 --> 27:14.545
- Nah, just checking him.

27:14.589 --> 27:17.723
I was at the scene
of the accident.

27:17.766 --> 27:20.682
- You're a firefighter.

27:20.726 --> 27:22.510
I'm sorry, my wife and I
haven't had a chance

27:22.553 --> 27:24.207
to follow up with
the insurance.

27:24.251 --> 27:26.122
- I'm not here about that, no.

27:28.124 --> 27:30.779
You don't have anything
to apologize about.

27:32.651 --> 27:37.743
I'm just here to stop by,
I guess, because...

27:37.786 --> 27:40.180
I got a son too.

27:40.223 --> 27:41.834
Noah's age.

27:44.663 --> 27:46.534
- Doctors say there's a good
chance he'll recover,

27:46.577 --> 27:49.668
but no idea how long it'll take
to get back on track

27:49.711 --> 27:53.236
or how it's gonna
impact his life.

27:53.280 --> 27:55.717
- Yeah.

27:55.761 --> 27:58.372
You can't control any of that.

27:59.765 --> 28:02.332
But now you're here.

28:02.376 --> 28:04.291
He's safe

28:04.334 --> 28:08.556
and he's surrounded by
the best care he can get.

28:11.951 --> 28:14.170
Hospitals can be a maze,

28:15.694 --> 28:20.481
there's good people here
and I know a lot of them.

28:20.524 --> 28:24.920
So this is my card,
my personal number.

28:24.964 --> 28:27.749
All right,
if you need any help

28:27.793 --> 28:30.621
advice, anything,
night or day,

28:30.665 --> 28:31.884
you give me a call, okay?

28:34.930 --> 28:36.540
Hey.

28:42.546 --> 28:44.331
- So these are all of
our run sheets

28:44.374 --> 28:45.593
since you arrived at 51.

28:45.636 --> 28:47.856
I've got October
through December,

28:47.900 --> 28:49.684
you take the last two months.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.338
- What am I supposed
to do with these?

28:51.381 --> 28:53.296
- Just comb through,
look for anything that might

28:53.340 --> 28:55.385
send up a flag so we
can anticipate what's coming.

28:55.429 --> 28:58.171
- What about the issue
from last shift, the versed?

28:58.214 --> 29:00.347
- I just want to make sure it's
not the tip of the iceberg.

29:00.390 --> 29:01.740
- Smart.

29:02.828 --> 29:06.266
- What are those sticks
they hit themselves with?

29:06.309 --> 29:07.789
- That's a banny venik,

29:07.833 --> 29:09.704
it's a broom made
from birch leaves.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.837
It secretes an aromatic oil,
it's really good for the skin.

29:11.880 --> 29:13.752
- What is this we're into now?

29:13.795 --> 29:15.797
- Otis is trying to get us
to go to a Russian Bath House.

29:15.841 --> 29:18.191
- A banya. They have one in
University Village.

29:18.234 --> 29:20.541
My cousin says he does it
before every ice swim.

29:20.584 --> 29:23.805
Just a solid hour
alternating hot and cold.

29:23.849 --> 29:25.198
- Ugh, it's like I can smell
the sweat

29:25.241 --> 29:26.677
coming
through the screen.

29:26.721 --> 29:28.767
- Well, but I thought
Dr. Rhodes said that

29:28.810 --> 29:31.247
there's no way to condition
a body for the Polar Plunge.

29:31.291 --> 29:32.814
- Who are you going to trust,

29:32.858 --> 29:34.860
a surgeon or a professional
Siberian ice swimmer?

29:34.903 --> 29:36.818
- Is this a serious question?

29:44.783 --> 29:45.958
- Brett.

29:49.918 --> 29:51.877
- Hey, what was that?

29:51.920 --> 29:54.967
- Um, I'm not sure.

29:59.536 --> 30:00.886
- Morning, everyone.

30:00.929 --> 30:02.626
- Hey.
- Hello, Cin.

30:02.670 --> 30:04.759
- Hey.
- Is Christopher around?

30:04.803 --> 30:07.675
He was supposed to bring these
college brochures with him

30:07.718 --> 30:09.764
to look at,
but he left them at home.

30:09.808 --> 30:12.419
- Uh, uh, he called in late.

30:12.462 --> 30:14.334
I--I think he took a detour.

30:14.377 --> 30:16.597
- Uh, yeah,
he swung by Chicago Med

30:16.640 --> 30:18.991
to visit that teenager.

30:19.034 --> 30:20.862
- Which teenager?

30:20.906 --> 30:23.996
- The kid he pulled out
of that car crash last shift.

30:24.039 --> 30:26.520
Boy's still in intensive care.

30:28.652 --> 30:30.785
- Right.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.743
I see.

30:35.485 --> 30:37.966
- Hey Emily,
uh, this is Jim.

30:38.010 --> 30:39.533
Hear you're having
some trouble

30:39.576 --> 30:41.404
with the EMS Consortium.

30:41.448 --> 30:44.407
Oh, that's gotta be a pain,
but I think I can help.

30:44.451 --> 30:46.845
If you want me to jump in
and fight for you,

30:46.888 --> 30:48.803
I wouldn't be opposed.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.587
Anyway, call me.

30:50.631 --> 30:53.025
We can grab a cup of coffee,
talk it through.

30:53.068 --> 30:54.330
Take care.

30:54.374 --> 30:55.810
- Gross.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.638
- What am I supposed
to do with this?

30:57.681 --> 30:59.292
- Can we turn this over
to the board?

30:59.335 --> 31:00.554
- And say what?

31:00.597 --> 31:02.077
That he offered to put in
a good word?

31:02.121 --> 31:03.731
They're not gonna hear
what we hear.

31:03.774 --> 31:05.515
- You let me get into
this again with Dr. Buchner.

31:05.559 --> 31:07.735
- No, I'm tired of this.

31:07.778 --> 31:09.737
Tired of--of letting him
set the terms

31:09.780 --> 31:11.782
and I'm tired of dragging
other people into my business.

31:11.826 --> 31:13.741
- Okay, I understand,

31:13.784 --> 31:15.786
but stop for a moment,
take a breath.

31:17.397 --> 31:18.702
Whatever your next move,

31:18.746 --> 31:21.444
you have to consider
the unintended effects.

31:23.533 --> 31:29.017
- Truck 81, Ambo 61, wellness
check, 2930 S. Trumbull Ave.

31:36.459 --> 31:37.896
- Show us the way.

31:39.375 --> 31:41.116
- I woke up and the roof was
leaking.

31:41.160 --> 31:42.813
I could hear the running water

31:42.857 --> 31:45.642
so I ran upstairs to see
if everything was okay.

31:45.686 --> 31:47.775
Been knocking for ages,
but no answer.

31:47.818 --> 31:49.124
- Any chance your neighbor
is out?

31:49.168 --> 31:50.996
- I don't think so.

31:51.039 --> 31:54.738
Quinton's car is right outside,
works the graveyard shift.

31:54.782 --> 31:56.871
Has a tendency to come home at
the break of dawn

31:56.915 --> 31:58.960
and get his load on.

31:59.004 --> 32:01.876
It's not my business,
but it's hard not to notice.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.704
- Let's take it.

32:07.751 --> 32:10.102
- Fire department.
- It's freezing in here.

32:10.145 --> 32:12.539
- And no surprise,
all the windows are open.

32:12.582 --> 32:14.715
- Fire department, call out.

32:22.027 --> 32:23.680
Here he is.

32:30.600 --> 32:33.603
- He must've passed out drunk
and froze.

32:33.647 --> 32:34.996
- Not feeling a pulse.

32:35.040 --> 32:36.606
- With his core temperature
that low,

32:36.650 --> 32:38.043
maybe he still has
a chance, right?

32:38.086 --> 32:39.740
Depending on how long
he's been in there.

32:39.783 --> 32:41.002
- Definitely.

32:41.046 --> 32:43.526
- All right,
let's get him out then.

32:43.570 --> 32:46.007
- All right, let's get him up.

32:46.051 --> 32:48.879
- On three.
One, two, three.

32:52.057 --> 32:54.624
- Ready?
- Yup.

32:54.668 --> 32:56.017
Grab his head.

32:56.061 --> 32:58.933
Okay, I'll start compressions.

33:09.552 --> 33:10.814
- Hang on.

33:12.816 --> 33:14.035
- Come on!

33:14.079 --> 33:16.124
- There's no rhythm.

33:16.168 --> 33:17.821
- Come on, come on.
He's not done.

33:18.997 --> 33:21.086
- Foster.

33:21.129 --> 33:22.435
- He's not done.

33:22.478 --> 33:25.873
One, two, three, four, five,

33:25.916 --> 33:29.094
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

33:29.137 --> 33:33.489
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

33:34.969 --> 33:38.103
One, two, three, four, five,

33:38.146 --> 33:40.061
six, seven, eight,

33:40.105 --> 33:41.628
nine, ten,
- Foster.

33:41.671 --> 33:44.631
- 11, 12, 13, 14, 15--

33:46.111 --> 33:48.026
- We got him,
he's coming around.

33:49.766 --> 33:52.073
- Hey sir, are you okay?

33:52.117 --> 33:54.815
You're okay, just breathe.

33:59.124 --> 34:01.039
Breathe, it's okay.

34:01.082 --> 34:03.215
- Go get the stair chair.

34:03.258 --> 34:05.782
- Just breathe.
Breathe, breathe.

34:13.268 --> 34:15.444
- Damn, how long was he out
before you got there?

34:15.488 --> 34:17.098
- Well that's hard to say.

34:17.142 --> 34:18.882
Anywhere from 30 minutes
to a couple of hours?

34:18.926 --> 34:20.319
- Well, congrats.

34:20.362 --> 34:22.234
Not every day you bring a man
back from the dead.

34:29.197 --> 34:31.852
- How you feeling?
- Glad we do what we do.

34:31.895 --> 34:33.071
- Hmm.

34:35.377 --> 34:37.945
- Hey, uh, stop for a sec.

34:41.557 --> 34:43.168
I'll meet you back at the rig.

34:43.211 --> 34:45.213
- Foster?

34:45.257 --> 34:46.562
Give him hell.

34:49.565 --> 34:51.480
- Dr. Shaw.

34:51.524 --> 34:53.656
- If he...
- You don't see me?

34:53.700 --> 34:55.397
That's how we're gonna
play this?

34:55.441 --> 34:57.269
- Okay, excuse me,
this is not the place for this.

34:57.312 --> 34:58.531
- Oh no, no, no.
I'm pretty sure it is

34:58.574 --> 35:00.185
because every woman
in this department

35:00.228 --> 35:01.621
deserves to know exactly
what kind of man

35:01.664 --> 35:03.318
they're working with.

35:03.362 --> 35:05.233
- Should I call security?
- That's not necessary.

35:05.277 --> 35:07.192
You wanna throw
your last chance away?

35:07.235 --> 35:08.367
Right here,
in front of everyone?

35:08.410 --> 35:10.064
- I'm sorry, is that a threat?

35:10.108 --> 35:12.022
Like the one you made
when you came by my firehouse

35:12.066 --> 35:15.156
begging me to go
on a second date?

35:15.200 --> 35:17.376
Maybe you can intimidate
other women like that,

35:17.419 --> 35:19.117
bully them into staying silent

35:19.160 --> 35:21.206
and doing what you want
them to do, but that is not me,

35:21.249 --> 35:22.555
not by a long-shot.

35:22.598 --> 35:25.079
So come on, go ahead,

35:25.123 --> 35:29.301
come at me with all you got,
won't matter.

35:29.344 --> 35:31.999
I don't need you
or some EMS board to tell me

35:32.042 --> 35:33.957
how good a paramedic I am.

35:37.744 --> 35:39.659
I'll let you get back to work.

35:39.702 --> 35:42.096
Looks like your boss
wants to have a little chat.

35:51.192 --> 35:52.411
- Hey, how'd it go?

35:52.454 --> 35:54.239
- The look on his face?

35:54.282 --> 35:56.371
I want to bottle that
and keep it on a shelf at home.

35:56.415 --> 35:58.460
- You!

35:58.504 --> 36:00.462
Where the hell do you get off
coming at me

36:00.506 --> 36:02.116
in front of
the entire hospital?

36:02.160 --> 36:04.074
Do you even comprehend
what you just did in there?

36:04.118 --> 36:06.947
- Hey, step back.
- I'm not talking to you!

36:06.990 --> 36:09.079
You have no idea
the kind of pull

36:09.123 --> 36:10.690
that I have in this building.

36:10.733 --> 36:12.692
When I'm done, you won't be
able to administer so much

36:12.735 --> 36:14.650
as an aspirin anywhere
in the state of Illinois.

36:20.265 --> 36:21.962
- Did you do this?

36:22.005 --> 36:24.225
- Never hurts to have
a little extra backup.

36:24.269 --> 36:26.445
- Oh, you got to be kidding me.

36:26.488 --> 36:28.316
- Morning.

36:28.360 --> 36:30.536
I understand you have a problem
with one of my paramedics.

36:30.579 --> 36:33.234
- No, this is between me and--
- All of us.

36:33.278 --> 36:35.454
See, when you come after
one of my paramedics,

36:37.238 --> 36:38.674
you come after all of us.

36:44.332 --> 36:45.638
- Chief?

36:45.681 --> 36:47.640
- I know you can handle
yourself, Emily.

36:47.683 --> 36:50.469
I'm just here
to let everybody know

36:50.512 --> 36:53.254
that harassment
of any paramedic

36:53.298 --> 36:54.560
will not be tolerated.

36:54.603 --> 36:57.127
Not now, not ever.

36:58.564 --> 37:00.522
So, you were saying?

37:22.544 --> 37:23.763
Let's go.

37:46.525 --> 37:49.092
- What's this?

37:49.136 --> 37:51.399
- Um, I'm cleaning the car.

37:51.443 --> 37:54.576
I'm--I'm really sorry, Dad.

37:54.620 --> 37:58.058
And I--I got enough money
saved up from summer work too.

37:58.101 --> 38:00.234
So I think it's enough
to get it fixed.

38:04.543 --> 38:06.501
- Come here.

38:23.431 --> 38:26.521
I shouldn't have come down
so hard on you the other night.

38:28.175 --> 38:31.221
I want you to know
that I trust you.

38:32.571 --> 38:37.489
But I'm never gonna stop
worrying about you,

38:37.532 --> 38:40.318
understand?

38:40.361 --> 38:41.493
- Yes, sir.

38:44.496 --> 38:46.106
Sweet.

38:46.149 --> 38:47.586
Thanks, Dad.

38:47.629 --> 38:49.675
- Yeah.

38:49.718 --> 38:51.807
The curfew still stands!

39:04.864 --> 39:06.735
I'm sorry.

39:06.779 --> 39:08.694
I was way out of line.

39:10.783 --> 39:12.785
- I know.

39:14.395 --> 39:16.876
I stopped by the firehouse.

39:16.919 --> 39:18.660
They told me everything.

39:38.680 --> 39:40.334
- You ready for this?

39:43.468 --> 39:45.208
- Any, uh, any last minute
advice from your cousin?

39:45.252 --> 39:48.168
- Yeah, one word: vodka.

39:48.211 --> 39:49.517
I'm starting to think
he might not know

39:49.561 --> 39:50.866
what he's talking about.

39:50.910 --> 39:52.390
- Foster was right,
we're all nuts.

39:52.433 --> 39:53.478
How long do we have
to go in for?

39:53.521 --> 39:54.914
- As long as you can handle it.

39:54.957 --> 39:57.351
- If you wanna have a go
at my five minute record,

39:57.395 --> 39:58.961
you're welcome to try.

39:59.005 --> 40:00.615
- Okay, let's be clear,

40:00.659 --> 40:03.270
we are here for charity,
we are here to have fun.

40:03.313 --> 40:05.359
Don't want to see anybody
pushing past their limits.

40:05.403 --> 40:08.362
I expect to see every single
one of you on duty next shift.

40:08.406 --> 40:09.972
All that being said,

40:10.016 --> 40:12.801
let's show those lightweights
over at 21st district

40:12.845 --> 40:14.542
what we can do!

40:17.371 --> 40:20.679
- Oh! I can't believe it.
You're here!

40:20.722 --> 40:23.203
- Family shows up, right?

40:23.246 --> 40:26.336
You all were there for me,
I'm here with you.

40:26.380 --> 40:27.903
- Well, there's a spectator's
section over there.

40:27.947 --> 40:29.731
I think they have
outdoor heaters set up.

40:29.775 --> 40:32.647
- Oh, no. I'm--I'm
not here to spectate.

40:36.825 --> 40:39.306
All right, are we gonna start
this thing or what?

40:39.349 --> 40:40.742
- Yeah!
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

40:40.786 --> 40:42.614
- Next up
we have representatives

40:42.657 --> 40:45.530
from the Chicago Fire
Department, Firehouse 51!

40:46.966 --> 40:48.881
- Swimmers,
take your positions!

40:48.924 --> 40:49.925
- This is fine.

40:49.969 --> 40:53.494
- Ready, set, go!
