01:13.031 --> 01:16.284
<i>When I look back on my life,</i>
<i>I see it on the big screen.</i>

01:16.951 --> 01:21.039
<i>A collection of memories</i>
<i>as full of light and color as the sky.</i>

01:24.501 --> 01:27.587
<i>I can remember the exact moment</i>
<i>I fell in love with movies.</i>

01:28.171 --> 01:30.423
<i>I went in knowing nothing</i>
<i>and came out knowing</i>

01:30.507 --> 01:34.135
<i>that if I could be in a movie theater,</i>
<i>I didn't wanna be anywhere else.</i>

01:34.636 --> 01:38.765
<i>I was ten years old that summer,</i>
<i>with nothing ahead of me but a whole life.</i>

01:38.848 --> 01:42.102
<i>On June 20th, one movie opened</i>
<i>that changed everything,</i>

01:42.185 --> 01:47.148
<i>and not just the future of Hollywood</i>
<i>but the lives of an entire generation.</i>

01:47.232 --> 01:49.692
<i>I know because I was there.</i>

01:49.776 --> 01:54.030
<i>I came of age in a dark theater,</i>
<i>staring up at that big screen,</i>

01:54.114 --> 01:57.450
<i>watching the same movie</i>
<i>over and over again.</i>

01:58.409 --> 02:01.538
<i>It was not just a movie. It was </i>the<i> movie.</i>

02:01.621 --> 02:03.456
<i>And that traps it in amber,</i>

02:03.540 --> 02:06.251
<i>along with the best things</i>
<i>I remember from that summer.</i>

02:16.719 --> 02:22.100
<i>The year was 1975,</i>
<i>and that movie was </i>Jaws.

02:30.275 --> 02:32.193
Oh God, help!

02:34.487 --> 02:36.698
God! God, help!

02:36.781 --> 02:39.284
It hurts! It hurts!

02:39.367 --> 02:41.870
Oh my God! God, help me!

02:42.370 --> 02:44.330
God, please, help!

02:46.916 --> 02:49.794
<i>After that,</i>
<i>nothing would ever be the same.</i>

02:50.545 --> 02:55.300
<i>Not summers, not movies,</i>
<i>not beaches, and not me.</i>

03:02.056 --> 03:06.686
<i>We grew up in Topanga Canyon,</i>
<i>which, in the '70s, was a wilderness</i>

03:06.769 --> 03:10.607
<i>of communes and health food stores</i>
<i>between the beaches and the Valley.</i>

03:10.690 --> 03:14.861
<i>We grew up like everyone</i>
<i>grew up back then, fast and free.</i>

03:15.445 --> 03:17.363
<i>Probably a little too free.</i>

03:17.947 --> 03:21.451
<i>Childhood wasn't eternal</i>
<i>or monitored like it is now.</i>

03:21.534 --> 03:23.953
<i>Our movies, our clothes, our music</i>

03:24.037 --> 03:27.832
<i>all told us that growing up was</i>
<i>way better than being a kid.</i>

03:39.344 --> 03:43.014
<i>My ten-year-old's reality was</i>
<i>stolen kisses at hippie bonfires</i>

03:43.097 --> 03:44.224
<i>on Topanga Beach.</i>

03:46.684 --> 03:50.146
<i>We didn't have social media to reflect</i>
<i>the fun we might be having.</i>

03:50.230 --> 03:52.482
<i>-No texting, no TikTok</i>.

03:52.565 --> 03:55.652
<i>We didn't have much of anything</i>
<i>except our imaginations</i>

03:55.735 --> 03:58.279
<i>and, every so often, the night sky.</i>

03:59.822 --> 04:04.077
<i>We'd stay up all night counting stars,</i>
<i>imagining what our lives might become.</i>

04:05.203 --> 04:09.749
<i>We told each other the dumbest shit,</i>
<i>like how Donna Summer did real sex…</i>

04:10.833 --> 04:13.711
<i>…while recording "Love to Love You Baby."</i>

04:13.795 --> 04:18.841
<i>Or how Bubble Yum was literally filled</i>
<i>with tiny spiders. Or that Mikey…</i>

04:18.925 --> 04:21.386
<i>He won't eat it.</i>
<i>He hates everything.</i>

04:21.469 --> 04:23.888
<i> …had eaten Pop Rocks,</i>
<i>chugged soda, and died</i>

04:23.972 --> 04:25.765
<i>when his stomach exploded.</i>

04:25.848 --> 04:27.433
<i>He likes it! Hey, Mikey!</i>

04:27.517 --> 04:29.769
<i>There wasn't much</i>
<i>we wouldn't believe.</i>

04:30.270 --> 04:32.855
<i>It is as if God created the devil…</i>

04:32.939 --> 04:36.734
-…<i>and gave him… jaws.</i>

04:36.818 --> 04:39.696
<i>Rated PG.</i>
<i>May be too intense for younger children.</i>

04:39.779 --> 04:44.200
<i>By June of 1975,</i>
<i>you could not escape </i>Jaws.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.953
<i>Universal made sure it was everywhere.</i>

04:47.036 --> 04:49.497
<i>The Benchley paperback</i>
<i>everyone was reading.</i>

04:49.580 --> 04:53.376
<i>The trailer everyone feared.</i>
<i>The poster everyone wanted.</i>

04:53.459 --> 04:55.044
<i>The T-shirts everyone wore.</i>

04:55.628 --> 05:00.550
<i>That massive, razor-toothed monster swam</i>
<i>inches beneath the same American culture</i>

05:00.633 --> 05:05.305
<i>that had just survived Charles Manson,</i>
<i>the Vietnam War, and Watergate.</i>

05:06.556 --> 05:08.766
<i>Everybody has a </i>Jaws <i>story.</i>

05:08.850 --> 05:12.228
<i>Mostly you hear them from boys,</i>
<i>who took ownership of that summer</i>

05:12.312 --> 05:14.147
<i>as their fanboy-nation origin story.</i>

05:14.230 --> 05:17.650
<i>-But girls, we were there too.</i>

05:17.734 --> 05:19.193
<i>Fuck yeah, we were there.</i>

05:22.864 --> 05:26.326
<i>Between welfare and food stamps,</i>
<i>our mom could barely afford admission,</i>

05:26.409 --> 05:28.202
<i>let alone popcorn.</i>

05:28.286 --> 05:29.662
<i>But we made a deal with her.</i>

05:29.746 --> 05:31.748
<i>if she dropped us off</i>
<i>in time for the first show,</i>

05:31.831 --> 05:34.208
<i>she wouldn't have to pick us up</i>
<i>until after the last.</i>

05:34.292 --> 05:35.710
<i>What should I do while you're gone?</i>

05:35.793 --> 05:37.378
<i>At the cost of one ticket each,</i>

05:37.462 --> 05:41.466
<i>that was how my sister and I saw </i>Jaws
<i>at least 40 times that summer.</i>

05:41.549 --> 05:43.259
<i>I'll be back in two minutes.</i>

06:02.570 --> 06:06.115
<i> But back then, to see a movie,</i>
<i>you had to actually go to the movies.</i>

06:06.199 --> 06:08.368
<i>And since there were</i>
<i>no theaters in Topanga,</i>

06:08.451 --> 06:11.287
<i>we had to drive 30 minutes</i>
<i>to the San Fernando Valley.</i>

06:11.371 --> 06:15.083
<i>For Canyon rats like us,</i>
<i>that was like visiting a utopian America</i>

06:15.166 --> 06:16.667
<i>only seen on television.</i>

06:17.502 --> 06:22.465
<i>It was boys who looked like Greg Brady</i>
<i>and girls who looked like Farrah.</i>

06:22.548 --> 06:24.926
<i>-You know, normal people.</i>

06:25.009 --> 06:27.595
<i>And it was so hot</i>
<i>you could barely breathe.</i>

06:38.606 --> 06:40.358
<i>Movies can freeze time,</i>

06:41.150 --> 06:45.071
<i>like vanilla ice cream melting down</i>
<i>your wrist on hot summer afternoons can.</i>

06:46.572 --> 06:48.491
<i>Like sleeping under the stars can.</i>

06:49.784 --> 06:51.494
<i>Like first kisses can.</i>

06:53.204 --> 06:54.997
<i>But you can't freeze time forever.</i>

06:55.665 --> 06:58.418
<i>That summer, there was a new man</i>
<i>in our mom's life,</i>

06:58.501 --> 07:02.463
<i>teaching her how to flip houses,</i>
<i>promising to get us off welfare,</i>

07:02.547 --> 07:04.757
<i>and tame the Topanga out of us.</i>

07:05.299 --> 07:08.594
<i>There were a lot of distractions</i>
<i>that summer, and we needed them.</i>

07:34.036 --> 07:36.247
<i>But </i>Jaws<i> was more than a distraction.</i>

07:36.330 --> 07:41.002
<i>It gave us something to turn to</i>
<i>instead of someone to run away from.</i>

08:02.273 --> 08:05.860
Jaws <i>wasn't just a blockbuster</i>
<i>or a pop culture phenomenon.</i>

08:06.444 --> 08:09.280
<i>It was a time and a place, a feeling,</i>

08:09.780 --> 08:12.200
<i>an atmosphere</i>
<i>that can never be fully appreciated</i>

08:12.283 --> 08:14.243
<i>by anyone who wasn't there.</i>

08:14.827 --> 08:18.664
Jaws <i>transformed our lives</i>
<i>in the ways we needed it to.</i>

08:18.748 --> 08:22.293
<i>And from then on, we willed</i>
<i>our childhood to be </i>Jaws.

08:23.336 --> 08:26.005
<i>Amity Island became our island.</i>

08:26.088 --> 08:29.675
<i>We reenacted Chrissie's death scene</i>
<i>any time we were near the water.</i>

08:29.759 --> 08:33.221
<i>A tree house in our backyard was our Orca</i>.

08:33.304 --> 08:35.556
The Jaws Log, <i>the must-have handbook</i>

08:35.640 --> 08:38.726
<i>for all self-respecting fans,</i>
<i>was our bible.</i>

08:39.477 --> 08:43.272
<i>We became self-taught experts</i>
<i>on the </i>Carcharodon carcharias.

08:43.856 --> 08:46.275
<i>We scoured the beaches for sharks' teeth.</i>

08:46.359 --> 08:50.112
<i>We got our hands on Super 8 cameras</i>
<i>so that we could make our own movies.</i>

08:51.531 --> 08:53.741
<i>We fell in love with the movies</i>
<i>that summer.</i>

08:54.242 --> 08:56.786
<i>No matter where we were, what we did,</i>

08:56.869 --> 08:59.080
<i>all we could think about was</i>
<i>sitting in the dark,</i>

08:59.163 --> 09:00.957
<i>elbow-to-elbow with our other family.</i>

09:01.040 --> 09:02.917
<i>When do I become an islander?</i>

09:03.000 --> 09:04.293
<i>Ellen, never.</i>

09:04.377 --> 09:06.921
<i>And it didn't even have to be inside.</i>

09:07.004 --> 09:10.174
<i>By taking advantage</i>
<i>of the kids-hide-on-the-floor discount,</i>

09:10.258 --> 09:13.719
<i>we could go to the Van Nuys Drive-In,</i>
<i>and Mom could come with us.</i>

09:13.803 --> 09:17.890
<i>Especially on those hot summer nights</i>
<i>when all you wanna do is sit outside.</i>

09:46.002 --> 09:47.962
<i>$3,000 buys an awful lot of roast.</i>

09:48.045 --> 09:49.672
<i>As much as I loved </i>Jaws<i> then,</i>

09:49.755 --> 09:53.426
<i>I was not capable of fully understanding</i>
<i>the complexity of the characters</i>

09:53.509 --> 09:57.597
<i>or the mastery of the filmmaking</i>
<i>at ten years old, maybe not even at 20.</i>

09:58.264 --> 10:02.018
<i>But if you watch a movie enough times,</i>
<i>you start to notice things.</i>

10:02.101 --> 10:03.311
<i>Can we go home?</i>

10:03.394 --> 10:06.022
<i> The more times I watched it,</i>
<i>the closer I looked.</i>

10:06.105 --> 10:09.317
<i>The closer I looked, the more I saw.</i>

10:09.400 --> 10:12.903
<i>Things I didn't catch</i>
<i>the first, oof, 30 times.</i>

10:12.987 --> 10:16.449
<i>And with each new discovery,</i>
<i>it was like a whole new movie appeared.</i>

10:17.199 --> 10:18.868
<i>It was the ridiculous</i>

10:19.660 --> 10:20.953
<i>and the sublime.</i>

10:22.163 --> 10:23.414
<i>The exhilaration.</i>

10:23.914 --> 10:25.124
Fast fish!

10:25.207 --> 10:26.500
Watch my hand!

10:27.001 --> 10:32.089
<i> Steven Spielberg, serving up</i>
<i>unflinching terror and childlike wonder</i>

10:32.173 --> 10:35.384
<i>in one perfectly composed shot</i>
<i>after another.</i>

10:35.468 --> 10:38.763
<i>His whole creative team</i>
<i>firing on all cylinders.</i>

10:40.306 --> 10:43.017
<i>The landmark score by John Williams,</i>

10:43.100 --> 10:45.144
<i>not just music but storytelling,</i>

10:45.728 --> 10:47.647
<i>deployed with such restraint.</i>

10:47.730 --> 10:49.148
<i>The shark theme is the shark,</i>

10:49.231 --> 10:52.151
<i>and when there is no shark,</i>
<i>there is no theme.</i>

10:52.985 --> 10:56.280
<i>Screenwriter Carl Gottlieb's</i>
<i>brilliant foreshadowing.</i>

10:56.364 --> 10:58.282
It… it's all psychological.

10:58.366 --> 11:00.201
You yell "barracuda."

11:00.284 --> 11:01.994
Everybody says, "Huh, what?"

11:02.078 --> 11:03.120
You yell "shark"…

11:03.204 --> 11:04.622
Shark, three-five-zero!

11:04.705 --> 11:07.792
<i> …we've got a panic on our hands</i>
<i>on the Fourth of July.</i>

11:07.875 --> 11:13.297
<i>Spielberg and editor Verna Fields'</i>
<i>careful modulation from full-blown panic…</i>

11:15.424 --> 11:17.927
<i>…to the depressurization of comic relief…</i>

11:18.678 --> 11:21.764
He made me do it! He talked me into it!

11:21.847 --> 11:25.059
<i> Rising again</i>
<i>into dread and horror.</i>

11:25.142 --> 11:28.229
Sha… shark! It's a shark!

11:29.063 --> 11:32.274
<i>It's going into the pond!</i>
<i>The shark's in the estuary!</i>

11:32.358 --> 11:34.193
-<i>Now what?</i>
-<i>In the estuary!</i>

11:34.276 --> 11:35.444
<i>Michael's in the pond.</i>

11:35.528 --> 11:37.321
Shark is in the pond!

11:37.405 --> 11:39.615
Shark! In the pond!

11:42.618 --> 11:45.454
Jaws <i>comes alive</i>
<i>in all the senses.</i>

11:45.538 --> 11:49.166
<i>You smell it. You hear it. You taste it.</i>

11:49.250 --> 11:50.334
<i>You live it.</i>

11:50.418 --> 11:54.672
<i>And the second it was over, I wanted</i>
<i>to get right back in line for more.</i>

11:54.755 --> 11:56.257
<i>And more.</i>

11:56.757 --> 11:58.384
<i>And more.</i>

11:58.801 --> 12:01.512
<i>After that,</i>
<i>the summer blockbuster was born.</i>

12:03.013 --> 12:06.475
<i>From then on, my sister and I</i>
<i>were full-blown movie geeks,</i>

12:06.559 --> 12:08.811
<i>waiting in line three hours for </i>Star Wars,

12:08.894 --> 12:11.981
<i>acting out the Chestburster scene</i>
<i>from </i>Alien,

12:12.064 --> 12:15.025
<i>tape recording </i>Raiders
<i>so that we could memorize every line,</i>

12:15.109 --> 12:18.863
<i>and scamming our way</i>
<i>into a sneak preview of </i>E.T.

12:18.946 --> 12:22.116
<i>We were standing in the same lines,</i>
<i>sitting in the same seats,</i>

12:22.199 --> 12:24.326
<i>but sometime between </i>Jaws<i> and </i>E.T.,

12:24.410 --> 12:27.037
<i>we looked down, and there were… boobs.</i>

12:57.485 --> 13:01.322
<i> Somehow, boys could grow</i>
<i>into men and still be fanboys.</i>

13:01.405 --> 13:05.242
<i>But once hormones were part</i>
<i>of the equation, they went one way,</i>

13:05.326 --> 13:08.662
<i>and we went the other.</i>
<i>We were no longer on the same quest</i>

13:08.746 --> 13:13.793
<i>but the prize at the end of it,</i>
<i>a thing to fear, to woo, to win.</i>

13:14.668 --> 13:17.671
<i>And it wasn't just that.</i>
<i>Hollywood changed too.</i>

13:17.755 --> 13:19.715
<i>At some point</i>
<i>in this blockbuster narrative,</i>

13:19.799 --> 13:21.884
<i>girls got left on the cutting room floor.</i>

13:21.967 --> 13:24.929
<i>Hollywood bet big on boys,</i>
<i>and it paid off.</i>

13:25.012 --> 13:28.057
<i>We watched the rise</i>
<i>of branded, packaged properties</i>

13:28.140 --> 13:30.434
<i>based on video games and comic books,</i>

13:30.518 --> 13:32.728
<i>financed by sell-through DVD revenues,</i>

13:32.812 --> 13:36.148
<i>all aimed at a reliable middle-school</i>
<i>male demographic.</i>

13:36.899 --> 13:38.651
<i>But sometimes you had to wonder,</i>

13:38.734 --> 13:41.779
<i>"Are these even movies?</i>
<i>What happened to the story?"</i>

13:44.824 --> 13:46.700
<i>Could </i>Jaws<i> even be made today?</i>

13:47.409 --> 13:51.330
<i>Could it survive the gauntlet</i>
<i>of Rotten Tomatoes,</i>

13:51.413 --> 13:52.706
<i>CinemaScore,</i>

13:52.790 --> 13:55.167
<i>the dreaded Oscar-worthiness test?</i>

13:55.960 --> 13:59.129
<i>Could it survive the scrutiny</i>
<i>of its mechanical shark,</i>

13:59.213 --> 14:03.050
<i>whose rubbery performance was irrelevant</i>
<i>back then but wouldn't be now?</i>

14:04.343 --> 14:08.889
<i>Could it survive the hive mind on Twitter,</i>
<i>picking over Spielberg's every intention?</i>

14:13.143 --> 14:14.812
Jaws<i> went so far over budget,</i>

14:14.895 --> 14:17.898
<i>it could've been</i>
<i>one of Hollywood's biggest disasters.</i>

14:17.982 --> 14:21.861
<i>Instead, time has revealed it to be</i>
<i>one of the greatest films ever made.</i>

14:21.944 --> 14:26.365
<i>But it also set an unrealistic bar</i>
<i>for what box office success meant.</i>

14:30.077 --> 14:33.289
<i>So are moviegoers the victims</i>
<i>of </i>Jaws<i>' success?</i>

14:33.372 --> 14:36.625
<i>Are all of us who showed up faithfully</i>
<i>over and over again</i>

14:36.709 --> 14:39.712
<i>to see this one movie,</i>
<i>to relive this one experience,</i>

14:39.795 --> 14:42.756
<i>are we to blame for the death</i>
<i>of all good things in cinema?</i>

14:42.840 --> 14:44.884
-Smile, you son of a…

14:50.347 --> 14:51.307
<i> Yes.</i>

14:51.849 --> 14:52.933
<i>And no.</i>

14:58.564 --> 15:01.901
<i>You can't blame movie fans</i>
<i>for liking what they like.</i>

15:02.443 --> 15:04.403
<i>But Hollywood seemed to learn</i>
<i>the wrong lessons</i>

15:04.486 --> 15:05.988
<i>from the summer of the shark.</i>

15:06.697 --> 15:09.158
<i>They chased a spectacle</i>
<i>and the numbers game</i>

15:09.241 --> 15:12.786
<i>but forgot what really made </i>Jaws Jaws.

15:12.870 --> 15:15.956
<i>It was a great story, brilliantly told.</i>

15:17.082 --> 15:21.754
<i>For me, movies will always represent</i>
<i>the manifestation of the surreal,</i>

15:21.837 --> 15:24.340
<i>the beautiful, and the terrifying.</i>

15:24.423 --> 15:27.927
<i>Movie theaters offer</i>
<i>both the wonder and danger of Oz</i>

15:28.010 --> 15:30.012
<i>and the safe haven of Kansas.</i>

15:30.888 --> 15:35.392
<i>The best movies, like the worst people,</i>
<i>can leave you with scars,</i>

15:35.476 --> 15:40.189
<i>with courage in the place of fear,</i>
<i>and, if you're lucky, hope.</i>

15:40.940 --> 15:44.568
<i>And when there is no hope,</i>
<i>there may be sharks</i>

15:44.652 --> 15:46.779
<i>and long-lost summers</i>

15:46.862 --> 15:50.532
<i>and little girls in dark theaters</i>
<i>quoting the lines of a movie…</i>

15:50.616 --> 15:54.328
-<i>I used to hate the water.</i>
-<i>…they already know by heart.</i>

15:54.828 --> 15:56.830
<i>I can't imagine why.</i>
