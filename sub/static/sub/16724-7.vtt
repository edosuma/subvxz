00:19.305 --> 00:21.306
55...
Distinguished gray.

00:21.307 --> 00:23.308
56...
Undistinguished gray.

00:23.309 --> 00:25.143
Hey! Stop counting
my gray hairs.

00:25.144 --> 00:27.713
We would count Dad's,
but his hair is so fragile.

00:27.714 --> 00:29.815
No, it's not. Oh,
my God, a clump.

00:29.816 --> 00:32.551
Mom, can I use this bag to store
my Thundergirls uniform?

00:32.552 --> 00:35.320
Aw. I still can't believe
you quit the Thundergirls.

00:35.321 --> 00:37.723
Are you gonna put away
your thunder-wear? (chuckles)

00:37.724 --> 00:39.992
Congratulations on getting out
of that cult, Tina.

00:39.993 --> 00:42.361
I was just getting too old
for it, I guess.

00:42.395 --> 00:44.830
What do you mean "too old"?
Dad, Tina's 13.

00:44.831 --> 00:46.999
In Thundergirl years,
that's, like, 40.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.834
Hey. 40 is the new 38.

00:48.835 --> 00:51.236
Yeah, and 38 is the new...
(meows)

00:51.237 --> 00:53.372
Yeah.
Tina, what happened?

00:53.373 --> 00:54.606
There may have been
a culture clash

00:54.607 --> 00:56.375
between me
and the younger girls.

00:56.376 --> 00:58.176
I mean, I wouldn't say
I was a stick in the mud...

00:58.211 --> 00:59.878
Look, a stick in the mud!
In the old days,

00:59.879 --> 01:01.780
that's how a Thundergirl
made a sun dial.

01:01.781 --> 01:03.949
Oh, that's nice, Tina.
Did everyone see Tina's stick?

01:03.950 --> 01:05.516
GIRLS: Yes...

01:05.551 --> 01:07.719
Anyway, now that I have
an opening in my schedule,

01:07.720 --> 01:09.221
I can spend more time
with you guys.

01:09.255 --> 01:11.590
Okay, great. Gene, what do
we got going on this week?

01:11.591 --> 01:14.026
Uh, you've got a bath
night I can move around,

01:14.027 --> 01:15.427
but you've already
moved it twice.

01:15.428 --> 01:17.162
Let's cancel it.
Tina, you're in.

01:17.196 --> 01:18.797
Okay.
Well, I know what I'm doing.

01:18.798 --> 01:20.132
I'm calling Gretchen
at the salon.

01:20.133 --> 01:21.566
Say good-bye to the gray, kids.

01:21.567 --> 01:23.135
Fine. But I'm keeping this one.

01:23.136 --> 01:24.803
Ow!
Oops, it's a black one.

01:24.804 --> 01:27.205
I'll put it back.

01:28.975 --> 01:30.809
Ugh, Gretchen,
I'm so glad you got rid

01:30.810 --> 01:32.744
of those old-lady grays.
No more salt

01:32.779 --> 01:34.046
with this pepper.
You ready?

01:34.047 --> 01:35.280
Ready!
Ta-da!

01:35.281 --> 01:36.715
(gasps) Oh! Oh, my God!

01:36.716 --> 01:38.283
Uh-oh.
Yeah, uh-oh!

01:38.284 --> 01:40.552
L-Little mistake.
You made me look like a zebra!

01:40.553 --> 01:42.287
Fix it! Please, fix it. Don't panic.
Don't panic. Don't panic, Lin.

01:42.288 --> 01:43.722
Fix it!
I know... I know what I can do.

01:43.723 --> 01:45.590
Dye it back!
No.

01:45.591 --> 01:47.159
Dye it blonde.
What?

01:47.160 --> 01:49.161
Trust me. Everything
is better as a blonde.

01:49.162 --> 01:52.097
Everything looks better.
Everything tastes better. Like what?

01:52.098 --> 01:54.299
Ketchup packets, cough drops...
Ketchups?

01:54.300 --> 01:57.061
Come on. Do it, do it, do it, do it,
do it, do it, do it, do it, Oh...

01:57.070 --> 01:58.804
do it, do it, do it.
Yeah! Yeah!

01:58.805 --> 02:00.806
Yeah! Yeah!
What the hell?

02:02.442 --> 02:04.142
(tinkling)

02:04.177 --> 02:05.677
LINDA (sultrily):
Can I get a menu, please?

02:05.678 --> 02:07.079
Whoa!
Oh, my God.

02:07.113 --> 02:09.114
GENE:
Ah! It's middle-aged Mom Barbie!

02:09.148 --> 02:11.049
I like your hair.
It matches your teeth.

02:11.084 --> 02:12.284
Thank you, Tina.

02:12.318 --> 02:13.819
Sort of an extreme reaction

02:13.820 --> 02:15.787
to a few gray hairs,
don't you think?

02:15.822 --> 02:17.823
No. I'm not having more fun yet.

02:17.824 --> 02:19.524
Wait! Yes, I am!
You see?

02:19.525 --> 02:21.526
Gene gets it.
Bobby, you try.

02:21.527 --> 02:25.130
No, I don't think so.
Aw, come on! Tina?

02:25.164 --> 02:28.467
Um, can I do it later after
the chemical smell wears off?

02:28.501 --> 02:29.601
Louise?

02:29.636 --> 02:31.276
Who said that?
Where's Mom?

02:33.506 --> 02:35.507
WOMAN (quietly): Tina? Trash?

02:35.508 --> 02:37.509
No, it's Ginny.
From Thundergirls.

02:37.543 --> 02:39.478
Ginny? What are you doing
in our alley pretending

02:39.512 --> 02:41.213
to be the trash?
I couldn't risk anyone seeing me.

02:41.214 --> 02:42.447
I'm here because

02:42.482 --> 02:45.817
Troop 119 has... a... mole.

02:45.852 --> 02:47.486
I thought
Katie just had a beauty mark.

02:47.520 --> 02:49.521
No, a mole-mole.

02:49.522 --> 02:51.523
I think someone in our troop
has been spying on us.

02:51.524 --> 02:54.459
For our archrivals, Troop 257.

02:54.494 --> 02:57.329
(gasps) Troop 257?
They're the toughest troop in town.

02:57.330 --> 03:00.298
I heard they hold hot dogs in
the fire with their bare hands.

03:00.299 --> 03:01.800
Yeah. I saw one of them
at the mall,

03:01.801 --> 03:03.602
and I hid in the middle
of a rack of clothes.

03:03.636 --> 03:05.303
But how could there be a mole
in Troop 119?

03:05.304 --> 03:07.139
We pinky-swore
we'd be friends forever.

03:07.140 --> 03:09.141
Except that one girl who didn't
have a pinky and moved away.

03:09.142 --> 03:10.342
She had a lot going on.

03:10.376 --> 03:12.010
Tina, I know it sounds crazy,

03:12.011 --> 03:13.812
but it's the only explanation.

03:13.846 --> 03:15.814
You know how every year
our cookie sales are pathetic?

03:15.848 --> 03:17.716
Yeah, that's our thing.
It's because of the mole.

03:17.717 --> 03:20.552
She's been giving away
our cookie leads to Troop 257.

03:20.553 --> 03:23.245
I wasn't 100% certain
until last week...

03:23.256 --> 03:25.357
<i>I was at my new job.
Lot of cookie lovers there.</i>

03:25.358 --> 03:26.591
<i>I could smell it.</i>

03:28.428 --> 03:30.062
<i>I arranged for Troop 119 to come</i>

03:30.063 --> 03:31.329
<i>to my office and sell cookies.</i>

03:31.330 --> 03:32.998
<i>It was gonna be a huge score.</i>

03:33.032 --> 03:34.031
<i>But when we showed up,</i>

03:34.033 --> 03:36.334
<i>guess who beat us to the punch.</i>

03:36.369 --> 03:38.737
TINA: <i>Troop 257?</i> GINNY: <i>Yes.</i>

03:38.771 --> 03:43.608
<i>I had to eat Troop 257's
cookies from my own break room.</i>

03:43.609 --> 03:45.243
TINA: <i>Well,
you didn't have to. You...</i>

03:45.244 --> 03:47.713
I had to, Tina. I had to!
I'm so sorry.

03:47.714 --> 03:49.381
I've talked to all
the girls in the troop,

03:49.382 --> 03:51.516
and I can't rule
out any of them.

03:51.517 --> 03:54.119
The mole could be anybody.

03:54.120 --> 03:56.221
Except you, Tina.

03:56.222 --> 03:58.290
Oh, good. It can't be you
because you left the troop

03:58.291 --> 04:00.292
before the humiliating
office incident.

04:00.293 --> 04:02.094
That's why I need you to rejoin.

04:02.095 --> 04:04.196
Talk to the girls.
Find the mole.

04:04.197 --> 04:06.531
Me? Rejoin?
But my wounds are still fresh.

04:06.532 --> 04:08.433
I mean, I don't actually have
wounds. And if I did,

04:08.434 --> 04:10.402
I would do first aid on them
because I have that patch.

04:10.436 --> 04:12.938
Tina, every year at the cookie
jamboree, I've had to explain

04:12.939 --> 04:15.207
why we have the
lowest sales of anyone.

04:15.208 --> 04:17.108
I'm not doing it
anymore. I'm not!

04:17.110 --> 04:18.944
Now, if I don't find the mole,
I'm just... I'm gonna...

04:18.945 --> 04:21.380
I'm gonna dissolve the troop!
Huh?! Dissolve Troop 119?

04:21.380 --> 04:23.248
No, you can't!
Well, I'm gonna do it!

04:23.282 --> 04:24.549
Fine, I'll help you find
your mole.

04:24.584 --> 04:26.251
Great. Okay. Thank you.

04:26.252 --> 04:29.354
And remember, don't tell anyone
anything about this.

04:29.389 --> 04:31.723
Got it. This is between you,
me, and my journal.

04:31.724 --> 04:33.892
No. No journal.
I meant my secret journal.

04:33.893 --> 04:36.228
The one you don't know about.
You just told me about it.

04:36.229 --> 04:38.430
Okay. I'll just write it in
a letter and mail it to myself

04:38.431 --> 04:40.432
and not open it.
No. Don't write it anywhere.

04:40.433 --> 04:43.301
Okay. Cool, cool,
cool, cool. Cool.

04:43.302 --> 04:45.637
We're back in, original copy
of the Thundergirls handbook

04:45.672 --> 04:47.906
that the other girls think
is old and outdated,

04:47.907 --> 04:49.908
like me. High five.
GENE: Hey, Tina.

04:49.909 --> 04:52.577
We're gonna go find shells
and make me a shell bikini.

04:52.578 --> 04:54.112
Want to come?
Whoa!

04:54.147 --> 04:56.081
What's with the
Thundergirls uniform?

04:56.082 --> 04:58.917
I decided to rejoin the Thundergirls.
What? No, Tina.

04:58.918 --> 05:01.586
You just got out.
Now you're going back in?

05:01.587 --> 05:03.588
You're like the Brett
Favre of Thundergirls.

05:03.589 --> 05:06.391
I couldn't stay away. I mean,
it's not for any weird reason.

05:06.426 --> 05:07.993
It's not like there's a mole
in our troop

05:07.994 --> 05:10.429
and I'm going undercover
to catch her or anything.

05:10.430 --> 05:12.664
(chuckles nervously)

05:12.699 --> 05:15.167
Wait, wait, wait. Your troop has
a mole? A thunder-mole?

05:15.201 --> 05:16.601
What? Where'd you get that idea?

05:16.636 --> 05:18.637
Is she giving away your cookie
secrets or something?

05:18.638 --> 05:21.106
That's my stage name,
Cookie Secrets.

05:21.107 --> 05:24.109
Actually, yes. To Troop 257.
But you didn't hear it from me.

05:24.110 --> 05:26.845
Tina, you're the worst person to
go undercover to catch a mole.

05:26.846 --> 05:28.447
You just spilled your
whole story to us.

05:28.448 --> 05:30.048
You guys were
all over me about it!

05:30.049 --> 05:31.817
All right, here's
what you got to do.

05:31.818 --> 05:33.819
You got to go in there
and rattle some cages.

05:33.820 --> 05:36.221
Grab those Thundergirls and
shake 'em till you shake out

05:36.222 --> 05:39.791
a confession! It's me!
It's me! I'm the mole!

05:39.826 --> 05:41.993
No, Louise. I have to go
about this delicately.

05:41.994 --> 05:44.329
I have to make the mole
feel safe so she comes to me.

05:44.330 --> 05:46.398
Ugh, Tina,
you so need me on this.

05:46.399 --> 05:48.333
Do what I say
and say what I say,

05:48.334 --> 05:50.335
and we'll have this case cracked
by dinnertime.

05:50.336 --> 05:53.071
Louise, it's Thundergirls stuff.
You wouldn't understand.

05:53.072 --> 05:55.974
I can handle this on my own.
You don't need to get involved.

05:56.008 --> 05:58.577
(scoffs) Tina, please.
I'm not gonna get involved.

05:58.578 --> 06:00.245
It's not like I'm gonna go out
right now

06:00.246 --> 06:01.680
and buy a Thundergirls uniform

06:01.681 --> 06:03.415
and then show up
at your meeting later.

06:03.416 --> 06:05.183
I mean, come on.
Okay, good.

06:05.184 --> 06:07.586
Hey! I was thinking you guys
could start calling me Blom.

06:07.587 --> 06:10.422
Because I'm blonde and I'm your mom.
Get it? (chuckles)

06:10.423 --> 06:12.024
Mom, we're busy in here.

06:12.025 --> 06:13.759
Hey, don't talk
to Blom like that.

06:13.760 --> 06:15.527
Thank you, Gene.

06:15.561 --> 06:18.130
Okay, Tina. You're back.

06:18.164 --> 06:20.365
I mean, you're not back.
You're here to find the mole.

06:20.366 --> 06:22.200
I mean, maybe sing some songs
and make some s'mores.

06:22.201 --> 06:23.869
But mostly to find the mole.

06:23.870 --> 06:26.038
Hey, good to see the braid
trains are still running.

06:26.072 --> 06:29.207
Tina, come on in.
Look who's back, everyone.

06:29.242 --> 06:31.843
Hey, guys. It's your cool, young,
hip friend Tina. Can you dig it?

06:31.844 --> 06:33.578
You can take my place
on the braid train.

06:33.579 --> 06:35.013
I have to get snack ready.

06:35.048 --> 06:37.549
I hope you all like chips
with <i> guaca-mole.</i>

06:37.583 --> 06:39.584
Ginny, did you know that
the last chip in the bowl

06:39.585 --> 06:41.920
is 93% skin cells?

06:41.954 --> 06:44.089
Ugh, yes, Jodi.

06:44.123 --> 06:46.124
This is nice. Oh, hey,
should we play a game

06:46.125 --> 06:48.293
where we tell each other
our deepest, darkest secrets?

06:48.294 --> 06:50.295
Just kidding. I mean,
unless you want to.

06:50.296 --> 06:51.730
(door shuts) LOUISE:
Room for one more

06:51.764 --> 06:53.565
on that Thundertrain?
Huh?

06:53.566 --> 06:54.566
Oh. Hi.

06:54.567 --> 06:55.567
Are you...

06:55.568 --> 06:56.568
Nobody told me...

06:56.569 --> 06:57.969
I-I don't have any...

06:57.970 --> 06:59.805
Paperwork? Don't
worry about it, honey.

06:59.806 --> 07:01.406
My lawyer's sending it over.

07:01.441 --> 07:04.943
Meet your newest, greenest,
preteenest Thundergirl, me.

07:04.977 --> 07:06.978
No! I mean, welcome.

07:06.979 --> 07:08.280
Thank you.

07:09.892 --> 07:11.826
Louise, I can't believe you
joined my Thundergirls troop.

07:11.827 --> 07:13.828
I told you I had everything
under control.

07:13.829 --> 07:15.997
Also, your sash is
a disaster. (grunts)

07:15.998 --> 07:18.099
(sighs) That was
driving me crazy. Tina,

07:18.134 --> 07:21.570
forget about the stupid sash.
We've got a mole to catch, girl!

07:21.571 --> 07:23.405
You and I are the mole patrol.

07:23.406 --> 07:26.074
(mimicking siren)
Come on! Do it!

07:26.075 --> 07:28.310
Beep, beep. No, l...
Look at my mouth.

07:28.311 --> 07:29.744
(mimicking siren)

07:29.745 --> 07:30.912
Let's just get down to business.

07:30.913 --> 07:32.380
All right, here's what we know:

07:32.415 --> 07:34.816
Troop 119 has a mole
who is giving away secrets

07:34.817 --> 07:37.252
to Troop 257. GENE: Mm.

07:37.286 --> 07:40.121
So, which one of you is
sabotaging our cookie sales?

07:40.156 --> 07:42.490
Katie. She's in honors math.
LOUISE: Or...

07:42.525 --> 07:44.926
she's an evil genius.
Ooh.

07:44.961 --> 07:46.494
TINA: Julie.
She's kind of a motor mouth.

07:46.495 --> 07:47.629
LOUISE:
Is she yapping about troop secrets?

07:47.663 --> 07:49.631
Hmm?

07:49.665 --> 07:51.600
TINA: Rena.
She's a little on the short side.

07:51.601 --> 07:54.169
But maybe she's telling
tall tales.

07:54.170 --> 07:55.642
Mm-hmm.

07:55.671 --> 07:57.105
TINA:
Jodi. She wears rubber gloves

07:57.106 --> 07:58.974
because she's
a major germophobe.

07:59.008 --> 08:01.443
Or so she won't leave
any fingerprints behind.

08:01.444 --> 08:03.645
(gasps) And finally

08:03.646 --> 08:05.647
there's Molly.
She's double-jointed.

08:05.681 --> 08:07.282
Or a double-crosser.

08:07.283 --> 08:08.950
TINA: Any one of them
could be the mole.

08:08.951 --> 08:11.486
But who? GENE:
Look at this suspicious character.

08:11.520 --> 08:13.622
Gene...
Just let me into your world!

08:13.623 --> 08:17.192
(sighs) Fine. You...
go through everyone's trash, okay?

08:17.193 --> 08:19.794
Dig around. Look for...
Half-eaten sandwiches?

08:19.795 --> 08:22.397
No, clues!
They're not mutually exclusive!

08:22.398 --> 08:24.733
So we all agree,
a surgical mole removal

08:24.734 --> 08:26.735
and no one gets hurt.
Right, Louise?

08:26.736 --> 08:30.171
Yeah, we all agree.
But what if I just did this?

08:30.172 --> 08:32.240
Ah! Ah! And now we shoot them.

08:32.241 --> 08:34.676
Just kidding. I kind of thought
that'd be more fun.

08:34.677 --> 08:36.144
Let's go trip Dad.

08:36.145 --> 08:38.880
♪ So blonde, so delicate
and blonde. ♪

08:38.881 --> 08:42.765
(sultrily): Here are your buns, Mr. Belcher.
Why are you calling me Mr. Belcher?

08:42.765 --> 08:44.686
- Don't say 'cause I'm your boss...
- 'Cause you're my boss...

08:44.687 --> 08:46.688
- And you're my sexy assistant.
- And I'm your sexy assistant.

08:46.689 --> 08:49.925
Yes. I'm gonna take
off all my clothes

08:49.926 --> 08:51.693
and wait for you in the walk-in.

08:51.694 --> 08:53.528
I don't think
that's a good idea to...

08:53.529 --> 08:55.363
(whoops) Ow! That hit my eye.

08:55.364 --> 08:57.265
Yes, it did.
It really hurts.

08:57.266 --> 08:59.434
(groans) Let me look at it,
you big baby.

08:59.435 --> 09:01.202
Oh! I'm the blonde nurse!
No. No, no.

09:01.203 --> 09:03.772
It's World War II.
You got shot in the eye. No.

09:03.773 --> 09:06.541
The chemistry between us
is smoldering. Oh, my God.

09:06.542 --> 09:08.877
Let me see it. This...
The fantasy doesn't work.

09:08.878 --> 09:11.279
Why? I-I feel like if
I got shot in the eye,

09:11.280 --> 09:13.615
I would want you to help my eye.
And my brain.

09:13.616 --> 09:15.951
Well, I don't know. I'm not
a freaking doctor. I'm a nurse, Bob.

09:15.952 --> 09:19.120
Well, can you get a doctor?
'Cause I need a doctor. Oh, wait.

09:19.121 --> 09:21.356
(deep male voice): Uh, I'm a doctor.
No. Not...

09:21.357 --> 09:24.426
Uh, let me look at that over here.
Oh, my God.

09:25.895 --> 09:27.796
How are your bracelets
coming along, girls?

09:27.797 --> 09:29.397
Fine. Good. Fine.

09:29.432 --> 09:31.433
I'm giving my bracelet
to my new baby sister.

09:31.434 --> 09:34.169
She's so cute and she
has almost no jewelry.

09:34.203 --> 09:35.637
I'm giving mine to Katie.
I'm giving mine to Julie.

09:35.638 --> 09:37.572
Jinx! (chuckles) Jinx!
(chuckles)

09:37.573 --> 09:39.975
(groans) I mean... (laughs)

09:39.976 --> 09:42.244
(quietly): Okay,
time to put the plan into action.

09:42.245 --> 09:44.646
Phase one: Get them to trust me.

09:44.647 --> 09:46.648
That's a pretty bracelet, Julie.
Thanks!

09:46.649 --> 09:49.484
Okay, phase one complete.
Phase two: Turn everyone

09:49.485 --> 09:52.420
against each other until the mole
is flushed out. Wait, what?

09:52.421 --> 09:54.656
Katie told me she thinks
your bracelet's ugly.

09:54.657 --> 09:55.924
Huh?
(scoffs)

09:55.925 --> 09:57.792
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.

09:57.793 --> 10:00.629
♪ ♪

10:07.737 --> 10:10.272
(indistinct arguing)

10:16.312 --> 10:18.580
Okay, I found
some pretty cool stuff,

10:18.581 --> 10:20.749
and I've organized
everyone's trash into piles.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.417
Whose trash is that? Jodi's.

10:22.418 --> 10:24.819
Hmm. Interesting.
It's all interesting.

10:24.820 --> 10:26.821
Each pile tells a story.

10:26.822 --> 10:30.025
For example, last night,
Rena had chicken. The end.

10:30.026 --> 10:32.661
Louise! Everyone in
Troop 119 hates each other.

10:32.662 --> 10:34.796
This is exactly what
I was worried about.

10:34.830 --> 10:36.631
I believe what
you're trying to say is,

10:36.632 --> 10:38.166
"Thank you.
Thank you, Louise,

10:38.167 --> 10:40.101
for helping me
smoke out the mole."

10:40.102 --> 10:42.003
Louise, you're going
to destroy the troop!

10:42.038 --> 10:44.105
Why do you care so much
about the troop, anyway?

10:44.106 --> 10:45.840
They rejected you, remember?

10:45.875 --> 10:48.143
Troop 119 shaped me
into the woman I am.

10:48.144 --> 10:49.711
I thought
your underwear did that.

10:49.712 --> 10:52.581
Tina, we tried things your way.
No, we didn't.

10:52.615 --> 10:55.050
I did in my head,
and it didn't work.

10:55.051 --> 10:58.286
You'll thank me later
when we remove the mole.

10:58.287 --> 11:01.623
Changing subject. Be honest,
do I look like a Jessica?

11:01.624 --> 11:03.024
This is nice.

11:03.025 --> 11:04.726
Wait. Where's Louise?
And where's Jodi?

11:04.727 --> 11:07.195
Katie, will you watch my lanyard?
I'll be right back.

11:07.196 --> 11:09.130
(whispers):
Let's mess with her lanyard.

11:09.131 --> 11:10.465
I know you know something.

11:10.466 --> 11:12.467
Tell me, or the glasses
get a swirly!

11:12.468 --> 11:14.202
I don't know what
you're talking about!

11:14.203 --> 11:16.238
And I can't see
what you're doing!

11:16.239 --> 11:18.707
I'm holding your glasses
over the toilet!

11:18.708 --> 11:20.508
(screaming)

11:20.509 --> 11:23.044
Louise! Sorry, Jodi. Let me
get your glasses back for you.

11:23.045 --> 11:24.713
(exhaling) Wait,
now what are you doing?

11:24.714 --> 11:26.548
Just that thing where
I breathe on the lenses

11:26.549 --> 11:29.017
and wipe them off with my shirt.
(screaming)

11:29.018 --> 11:31.052
I was just about to break her!

11:31.087 --> 11:32.520
You're causing too much trouble!

11:32.555 --> 11:34.256
At least I'm doing something.

11:34.257 --> 11:36.191
While you're making lanyards,
whatever those are,

11:36.192 --> 11:38.193
I'm the one
doing the dirty work.

11:38.194 --> 11:40.562
No more dirty work, Louise.
I think... (sighs)

11:40.563 --> 11:42.330
I think you
should leave the troop.

11:42.331 --> 11:44.099
Wha... What about mole patrol?!

11:44.100 --> 11:45.500
I'm shutting it down.

11:45.501 --> 11:47.235
(slowing): Wee-ooh-wee-ooh.

11:47.236 --> 11:49.504
That was the sound of
the siren shutting down.

11:49.505 --> 11:51.039
Okay, fine, I <i> will</i> leave.

11:51.040 --> 11:52.674
That's a great idea!

11:52.675 --> 11:54.409
Oh, it is?
Oh, yeah!

11:54.443 --> 11:56.011
So no hard feelings?
Nope!

11:56.012 --> 11:57.412
GINNY: All right, everyone,

11:57.413 --> 11:58.914
let's make
milk carton bird feeders.

11:58.915 --> 12:01.249
One last milk carton
bird feeder for the road?

12:01.250 --> 12:02.250
Good-bye!

12:02.251 --> 12:03.618
Bye. See you at home.

12:03.619 --> 12:05.620
Which one of you
lucky mamajammas

12:05.621 --> 12:08.089
wears a size 14 boot
and isn't all hung up

12:08.090 --> 12:09.557
about having one for each foot?

12:09.558 --> 12:11.026
Ugh. Gene, what are you wearing?

12:11.027 --> 12:13.028
Trash fashion.
I call it trashion.

12:13.029 --> 12:15.230
We should probably get
you a tetanus shot.

12:15.264 --> 12:16.264
Belcher residence.

12:16.299 --> 12:18.066
Tina, can you tell Mom and Dad

12:18.067 --> 12:20.368
I'll be late for dinner?
My meeting's running long.

12:20.369 --> 12:22.103
I hope Mom
doesn't get too upset.

12:22.138 --> 12:23.738
Oh, okay.
Wait, what meeting?

12:23.773 --> 12:25.907
Oh, just a troop meeting.
You know how it goes.

12:25.942 --> 12:27.876
Got it. Oh, yeah, yeah.
What troop?

12:27.877 --> 12:29.244
Troop 257, Tina.

12:29.278 --> 12:30.645
You joined Troop 257?

12:30.646 --> 12:32.213
No, Louise, you can't do that.

12:32.214 --> 12:33.548
They're the enemy troop.

12:33.549 --> 12:34.950
Too late.
Got to go. Bye-bye!

12:34.984 --> 12:36.418
Hello? Louise?

12:36.452 --> 12:38.453
Let's get to know
our newest member.

12:38.454 --> 12:40.488
Troop 2-5-7!
Whoo!

12:40.489 --> 12:43.058
You guys are the fun-dergirls
over here, am I right?

12:43.059 --> 12:44.459
Good start, good start.

12:46.429 --> 12:47.596
GIRL: <i>New girl,</i>

12:47.630 --> 12:48.931
I didn't catch your name.

12:48.965 --> 12:50.399
Alanis.
Where'd you say

12:50.400 --> 12:52.134
you moved from again?
New York, New York.

12:52.135 --> 12:54.169
Oh, my cousin...
Not the one in New York.

12:54.170 --> 12:56.138
New York, New York,
Michigan. Oh.

12:56.139 --> 12:58.073
Hey, so what are we
doing, making bracelets?

12:58.107 --> 12:59.241
Bracelets?

12:59.242 --> 13:00.943
(laughter)

13:00.944 --> 13:03.745
Girls, why don't you do
some wood carving today?

13:03.780 --> 13:05.881
(laughs): Okay! What
are we whittling?

13:05.915 --> 13:08.583
Well, you could whittle
a bear or a heart...

13:08.618 --> 13:09.952
We're whittling knives!

13:09.986 --> 13:12.654
(laughing):
You girls and your knives!

13:12.655 --> 13:15.123
Hey, guys, sorry... I had
to stay late at school.

13:15.158 --> 13:16.692
We had a bullying
lesson. From me.

13:16.693 --> 13:17.726
(blowing three raspberries)

13:17.760 --> 13:19.173
GIRLS: 2-5-7!

13:19.195 --> 13:21.196
What the hell was that?
Our handshake.

13:21.197 --> 13:22.965
Love it or lick it, snurb.

13:22.966 --> 13:24.866
Hey, I love it already, snurb.

13:24.867 --> 13:27.002
(blows raspberry)
No, it's like this.

13:27.003 --> 13:28.403
(blowing three raspberries)

13:28.438 --> 13:29.771
GIRLS: 2-5-7!

13:29.806 --> 13:32.341
Aah! That's awesome!
Do it again!

13:32.342 --> 13:34.142
All right.
Rock and roll.

13:34.177 --> 13:35.177
(blowing three raspberries)

13:35.178 --> 13:36.178
(laughs): Oh, girls.

13:36.179 --> 13:37.446
GIRLS: 2-5-7!

13:37.480 --> 13:38.513
How's it going?

13:38.548 --> 13:40.282
Any leads yet?
I did some research

13:40.283 --> 13:41.850
on good places to
go on our retreat.

13:41.851 --> 13:43.552
I thought we could all
spend some time together,

13:43.553 --> 13:45.153
talk, create a safe environment.

13:45.154 --> 13:47.189
We don't have time
to create a safe environment!

13:47.190 --> 13:49.958
Ginny, I couldn't help but notice
it smells kind of moldy in here.

13:49.959 --> 13:52.628
And so I have a couple names
of really good mold people...

13:52.629 --> 13:54.963
Oh! Not now, Jodi!

13:54.964 --> 13:56.865
I'll just... I'll leave
the list over here.

13:56.866 --> 13:59.234
I brought you back in here
to do a job.

13:59.235 --> 14:01.536
My duct tape wallet
got stuck in my hair.

14:01.537 --> 14:03.372
Well, then cut your hair, Rena!
Okay.

14:03.373 --> 14:05.173
The cookie deadline
is next week.

14:05.174 --> 14:07.142
If we don't catch the mole
before then,

14:07.143 --> 14:08.644
this troop is done!

14:08.645 --> 14:11.647
Uh...

14:11.648 --> 14:13.782
what do I do, what do I do?

14:13.783 --> 14:16.151
I'm sorry, Thundergirls,
I've let you down.

14:16.152 --> 14:18.920
Maybe Louise was right...
I don't have what it takes.

14:18.921 --> 14:20.956
I'm just a washed-up
old Thunderhag!

14:20.957 --> 14:22.257

14:28.431 --> 14:30.532
Lin, you've messed up this order.
Blonde?

14:30.533 --> 14:32.768
That's the third time today
you've got an order wrong,

14:32.769 --> 14:34.903
and we've only had three customers.
Blonde?

14:34.904 --> 14:38.006
Yeah, and I found a bunch of
cheese slices in the cash register.

14:38.007 --> 14:40.909
Oh. Uh-oh. I think being
blonde is making me dumb.

14:40.910 --> 14:43.078
Uh, no, it's that you
haven't paid attention

14:43.079 --> 14:45.581
to anything else
but your hair since you dyed it.

14:45.582 --> 14:47.583
No, really, I feel kind of dumb.

14:47.584 --> 14:49.585
Well, you are <i>kind</i> of dumb. Bob!

14:49.586 --> 14:50.953
I'm kidding.
I am kidding.

14:50.954 --> 14:52.955
You're very smart.
Oh, see?

14:52.956 --> 14:55.324
I don't get kidding anymore.
GRETCHEN: Linda?

14:55.358 --> 14:57.059
Who's that brown-haired beauty

14:57.060 --> 14:58.961
spinning around in
your restaurant?

14:58.962 --> 15:00.996
Who's that girl?
It's m... Whoa!

15:01.030 --> 15:02.598
Oh. GRETCHEN:
I really am dizzy, I really...

15:02.599 --> 15:04.399
Oh, boy. Help me up, please.
Oh, my God.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.001
Gretchen, you're a brunette now?

15:06.035 --> 15:07.970
I'm like the Tina Fey
of my salon now.

15:07.971 --> 15:09.705
Everyone thinks I'm
so smart and funny.

15:09.739 --> 15:12.374
Really? Yeah.
So, how's it going, James Blonde?

15:12.375 --> 15:14.476
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Uh, that's one of my jokes.

15:14.477 --> 15:17.613
You might not get it 'cause you're
blonde. I do get it, Gretchen.

15:17.614 --> 15:19.815
I think.
Well, I'm off to the library

15:19.816 --> 15:21.883
to pick up smart guys.
Good-bye, Gretchen.

15:21.918 --> 15:23.952
Real quick, Bob, what do you
think of the hair? I changed it.

15:23.987 --> 15:25.554
I know. Yep.
Good-bye, Gretchen!

15:25.588 --> 15:28.757
You know what they say...
once you go brown. Bye!

15:28.758 --> 15:30.325
Louise.

15:30.326 --> 15:32.928
Tina. Nice sash...
except for the numbers on it.

15:32.962 --> 15:35.130
Nice detective work... except
for not catching the mole.

15:35.131 --> 15:37.499
By the way, I'm heading
to a meeting right now.

15:37.500 --> 15:39.268
A huge cookie lead just came in.

15:39.269 --> 15:42.204
So I guess I got to go solve
this thing all by myself.

15:42.238 --> 15:44.940
Well, say hi to 257 for me.
But don't, because I hate them.

15:44.941 --> 15:46.608
I mean, "hate" is
a strong word, but...

15:46.643 --> 15:47.976
Okay, while you're
finishing that thought,

15:47.977 --> 15:49.444
I'm gonna go catch the mole.

15:49.445 --> 15:51.280
Thundergirls forever!
Thundergirls forever.

15:51.281 --> 15:52.514
We're 2-5-7!

15:52.515 --> 15:53.615
GIRLS: Tell 'em!

15:53.616 --> 15:54.917
What do we do with cookies?

15:54.918 --> 15:56.084
GIRLS: Sell 'em!

15:56.119 --> 15:57.853
And what do we do
with seat belts?

15:57.854 --> 16:00.389
GIRLS: Shut up!
Okay, I'll-I'll just drive slow.

16:00.423 --> 16:01.423
Fingers in!

16:01.424 --> 16:02.424
(blowing three raspberries)

16:02.425 --> 16:03.759
2-5-7!

16:03.793 --> 16:05.694
How'd we find out
about this cookie lead?

16:05.695 --> 16:07.095
Huh? I'm just curious.

16:07.096 --> 16:09.331
I mean, you guys seem
to have a lot of leads.

16:09.365 --> 16:11.178
We're here!

16:11.201 --> 16:12.968
Oh, no.

16:12.969 --> 16:14.169
You know this place?

16:14.204 --> 16:15.337
This place? Blech!

16:15.338 --> 16:17.005
Yeah, I got food poisoning here.

16:17.006 --> 16:19.107
Gross! You know what?
I can't even go in.

16:19.108 --> 16:20.275
I'm gonna, like, throw up.

16:20.310 --> 16:21.710
What are you talking
about, Alanis?

16:21.711 --> 16:23.445
You've got to help
carry cookies.

16:23.446 --> 16:25.214
(sighs) Fine. Be right there.

16:25.215 --> 16:26.982
Just got to adjust my sash.

16:26.983 --> 16:29.017
Aw, it's... does anybody's sash
just choke you?

16:29.018 --> 16:30.152
No.

16:31.721 --> 16:33.355
Hi, Thundergirls.

16:33.389 --> 16:34.660
Are you the cookie buyer?

16:34.691 --> 16:36.491
No... yeah... no. What?

16:36.526 --> 16:38.627
You wanted to buy
500 boxes of cookies?

16:38.661 --> 16:40.195
Uh, no, we didn't.

16:40.230 --> 16:41.530
I'll take 'em.
Gene, no.

16:41.531 --> 16:43.131
Fine, 70.
No, not 70.

16:43.132 --> 16:44.533
Sign here.
450?

16:44.534 --> 16:46.881
Don't sign that.
Just sign it. Louise?

16:46.903 --> 16:48.670
Why are you dressed
like a Thundermummy?

16:48.705 --> 16:51.373
Louise? Huh, you must have me
confused with someone else.

16:51.374 --> 16:52.841
I'm Alanis.

16:52.876 --> 16:54.142
What?
Louise, what's going on?

16:54.143 --> 16:55.711
Why do they think
we want cookies?

16:55.745 --> 16:58.046
Why do these people
keep calling you Louise?

16:58.081 --> 16:59.915
These people happen
to be her parents.

16:59.916 --> 17:01.850
Wait. Where's Tina?
What troop is this?

17:01.885 --> 17:03.352
ALL: 2-5-7!

17:03.353 --> 17:04.920
These people are her parents?

17:04.921 --> 17:06.555
What are they saying?!

17:06.556 --> 17:07.890
Well, bye!

17:07.891 --> 17:09.258
Hey, look who it is.

17:09.259 --> 17:10.858
People that I just
don't even know,

17:10.859 --> 17:12.426
because I'm not in that troop.

17:12.428 --> 17:14.262
Louise! Tina sent us a 911 text

17:14.263 --> 17:16.164
to meet her here.
What's going on?

17:16.165 --> 17:18.066
That's what we'd like
to know,<i> Alanis.</i>

17:18.067 --> 17:20.102
What are you guys
doing here, 257?

17:20.103 --> 17:22.671
This is our turf.
Are we rumbling, or what?

17:22.672 --> 17:24.873
Oh, my God!
Hold on, Larissa.

17:24.874 --> 17:27.342
Alanis is gonna tell us
what's going on.

17:27.377 --> 17:29.244
(chuckles) There's a good
explanation for everything

17:29.245 --> 17:32.381
that I'm gonna tell you
when I think of it outside.

17:32.382 --> 17:35.184
Oh! Geez!
I can explain what's going on.

17:35.218 --> 17:36.451
I know who the mole is.

17:36.452 --> 17:38.420
(all gasping)

17:38.421 --> 17:40.622
You guys are making
banana nut fudge cookies

17:40.623 --> 17:42.465
with macadamias now?!

17:44.248 --> 17:45.548
Tina, what is going on?

17:45.583 --> 17:47.250
Why did I dye my hair blonde?

17:47.251 --> 17:49.219
I don't understand
anything anymore!

17:49.253 --> 17:52.555
I said, I know who the mole is.
Allow me to explain.

17:52.556 --> 17:54.524
In the original edition
of the Thundergirls handbook,

17:54.525 --> 17:56.726
it says: "If you want
to trap a rabbit,

17:56.727 --> 17:58.895
you don't set <i> one</i> trap,
you set five."

17:58.930 --> 18:00.530
<i>I gave all of you
a fake cookie lead,</i>

18:00.531 --> 18:03.033
<i>each one at a different
location on Ocean Avenue.</i>

18:03.034 --> 18:04.567
<i>Then I staked out Ocean Avenue,
knowing that</i>

18:04.568 --> 18:07.437
<i>257 would show up
to one of the fake leads.</i>

18:07.471 --> 18:10.373
<i>I brought enough food, supplies
and toilet paper for days.</i>

18:10.408 --> 18:12.275
<i>Luckily, they showed up before
I finished my first roll.</i>

18:12.310 --> 18:13.310
Gotcha.

18:13.311 --> 18:14.477
That's when I texted everyone

18:14.478 --> 18:15.745
to come meet me here.
Wow!

18:15.746 --> 18:17.080
That's impressive.

18:17.081 --> 18:18.481
Okay, I am still lost.

18:18.482 --> 18:20.450
So, who was it?
Let's just say

18:20.451 --> 18:21.918
it rhymes with "Tina."

18:21.919 --> 18:23.920
It's you?!
No, it's Rena.

18:23.921 --> 18:25.121
(others gasp) Rena!

18:25.122 --> 18:26.456
Is that true?
(sputters)

18:26.457 --> 18:28.625
I'm not a mole!
Tina, how do we know

18:28.626 --> 18:30.894
<i>you</i> didn't tell Troop
257 to come here?

18:30.895 --> 18:32.929
This is your
family's restaurant.

18:32.930 --> 18:35.298
Uh... oh, yeah, good point.

18:35.299 --> 18:37.601
Yeah! Hold on a sec.
I found <i> these</i>

18:37.635 --> 18:39.135
in Rena's trash!

18:39.170 --> 18:40.837
So? Those are my
old soccer cleats.

18:40.838 --> 18:43.139
Well, they fit me perfectly,
and I'm grateful to you!

18:43.140 --> 18:44.441
This is ridiculous.

18:44.475 --> 18:47.577
Tina's obviously trying
to frame me.

18:47.578 --> 18:50.280
Tina?! No! No, I'm not.
I'm not framing her.

18:50.314 --> 18:51.348
Wait, Rena.

18:51.349 --> 18:52.682
(blowing three raspberries)

18:52.683 --> 18:54.618
GIRLS: 2-5-7! Uh-oh.

18:54.652 --> 18:56.119
Rena <i> is</i> the mole!

18:56.120 --> 18:59.923
I was right! I knew it!
I knew it was you!

18:59.924 --> 19:02.325
But you just accused me
on the ride over here.

19:02.326 --> 19:04.661
Yeah, you accused me, too.
I knew it was someone!

19:04.662 --> 19:06.296
The only thing
I couldn't figure out

19:06.297 --> 19:07.831
was why... why'd
you do it, Rena?

19:07.865 --> 19:09.866
(heavy sigh)
My first year as a Thundergirl

19:09.867 --> 19:12.836
was in Troop 257...
best year of my life.

19:12.837 --> 19:15.672
We were in a vicious cookie
turf battle with Troop 119.

19:15.673 --> 19:17.774
Drastic measures
had to be taken.

19:17.775 --> 19:20.377
<i>I was selected
for a very special assignment...</i>

19:20.378 --> 19:22.479
<i>to leave the troop I love</i>

19:22.513 --> 19:25.515
<i>and pretend to love
the troop I</i> hate.

19:25.549 --> 19:27.317
We thought you were our friend!

19:27.318 --> 19:28.818
All these friendship bracelets,

19:28.853 --> 19:31.388
did they mean nothing?
You mean this arm garbage?

19:31.389 --> 19:32.489
Larissa.

19:32.490 --> 19:33.990
(deep, strained grunting)

19:33.991 --> 19:34.991
(deep yell)

19:35.026 --> 19:36.226
Geez. I thought Tina

19:36.227 --> 19:38.128
took this Thundergirl
stuff seriously.

19:38.129 --> 19:40.463
You guys are intense. Yeah.
You're like Linda Hamilton

19:40.464 --> 19:42.032
when she does
all those angry pull-ups.

19:42.066 --> 19:43.667
Let's hear it for Tina!

19:43.668 --> 19:45.168
GIRLS: Yay!

19:45.169 --> 19:46.369
Ugh! Come on.

19:46.370 --> 19:47.671
Let's get out of here.

19:47.705 --> 19:49.673
Oh, wait!
We want to buy your cookies!

19:49.674 --> 19:52.142
GIRLS: No! Oh, right, right. No.

19:53.678 --> 19:55.879
With these glasses,
my <i> garbage</i> ensemble

19:55.880 --> 19:57.414
is complete.
It's good.

19:57.415 --> 19:59.516
I can't believe
I'm gonna say this,

19:59.517 --> 20:02.218
but I love it.
One man's trash is Gene's next outfit.

20:02.219 --> 20:04.254
Pick me out something
next time you go.

20:04.255 --> 20:06.990
What do you like to smell like?
Mm, surprise me.

20:06.991 --> 20:09.359
Well, another great
Thundergirls meeting.

20:09.393 --> 20:11.061
Look... I got a "wise owl" patch

20:11.062 --> 20:12.862
for demonstrating the wisdom
of an older Thundergirl.

20:12.863 --> 20:14.364
Got to hand it to you, T.

20:14.365 --> 20:16.066
You earned that patch...
you caught the mole

20:16.067 --> 20:18.201
and saved the troop.
I-I know... I just said that.

20:18.202 --> 20:19.703
So you're sticking with
the Thundergirls, huh?

20:19.704 --> 20:21.204
I kind of hoped you were done

20:21.205 --> 20:22.939
with that extremely long
chapter of your life.

20:22.940 --> 20:24.007
LINDA: Aw...

20:24.041 --> 20:25.675
the mole patrol's gonna miss

20:25.676 --> 20:28.511
hanging out with each other.
No. I mean, maybe.

20:28.512 --> 20:30.947
(gasps) You were a little
jealous of the Thundergirls.

20:30.948 --> 20:34.618
Taking your big sister away...
that's very insightful, Linda.

20:34.619 --> 20:37.487
I'm back! Aah! I feel
like I could read a book!

20:37.521 --> 20:40.190
Louise, you could always
come back to Troop 119.

20:40.191 --> 20:41.591
Nah. Thundergirls is your bag,

20:41.592 --> 20:44.394
and if I had to, I would
probably join Troop 257.

20:44.395 --> 20:46.963
But if there's a murder
or a drug sting, call me.

20:46.964 --> 20:48.865
Well, I made this
friendship bracelet for you.

20:48.866 --> 20:50.967
Eh, you know, I'm not
really a jewelry person.

20:50.968 --> 20:53.470
You don't have to wear it.
No, I'm gonna wear it forever.

20:53.471 --> 20:55.042
Back off.
