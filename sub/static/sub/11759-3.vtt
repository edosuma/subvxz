00:04.600 --> 00:06.364
<i>WALDRON: So many years
I wondered</i>

00:06.400 --> 00:08.289
<i>what I'd do
if I ever saw him again.</i>

00:08.320 --> 00:11.802
And then I did.
In a photo, in a briefing room.

00:11.840 --> 00:14.127
<i>And I was being sent to meet him
with a gun.</i>

00:16.120 --> 00:19.124
When this is all done, Steve,
I'll suffer for my actions.

00:19.160 --> 00:21.208
I'm under no illusions of
a happy ending.

00:21.240 --> 00:22.366
- (Gunshot)
- Shot fired!

00:22.400 --> 00:24.721
- (Mumbles)
- What's he saying?

00:24.760 --> 00:27.001
- What did he say'?
- I'm not sure what he meant.

00:29.520 --> 00:31.921
ARNOTT: <i>My job is to find
any and all evidence.</i>

00:31.960 --> 00:33.610
And what was found in the case'?

00:33.640 --> 00:35.369
A large number of banknotes.

00:35.400 --> 00:37.801
How did Detective Sergeant
Arnott react?

00:37.840 --> 00:39.126
He didn't bat an eye.

00:41.600 --> 00:43.045
<i>I don't think we should close</i>

00:43.080 --> 00:45.481
<i>the investigation
into Waldron's background.</i>

00:45.520 --> 00:47.124
<i>I'd like to keep digging.</i>

00:49.640 --> 00:52.450
Evidence of prolonged torture.
Cause of death isn't clear.

00:52.480 --> 00:54.608
Cutting his head off
can't have helped.

00:57.120 --> 01:00.249
This photograph shows
Danny Waldron as a teenager.

01:00.280 --> 01:04.126
This man's a young Ronan Murphy,
the suspect shot by Waldron.

01:04.160 --> 01:05.400
What'? They knew each other?

01:05.440 --> 01:07.124
And he bears
a strong resemblance

01:07.160 --> 01:09.845
to Linus Murphy's severed head.
Danny knew him too.

01:12.360 --> 01:16.365
No prior information of the
operation to move Tommy Hunter.

01:16.400 --> 01:18.971
<i>I had no prior knowledge.</i>

01:19.000 --> 01:20.923
<i>No prior knowledge at all.</i>

01:23.360 --> 01:26.250
Kate knows about me
and Jackie and Danny.

01:26.280 --> 01:29.170
I have to come clean. The longer
I leave it, the worse it looks.

01:29.200 --> 01:31.441
It is with deep regret
that I inform you all

01:31.480 --> 01:33.881
<i>of the death of PC Rod Kennedy.</i>

01:33.920 --> 01:36.605
Rod's body was found hanged
at an industrial unit.

01:46.600 --> 01:48.045
We need to talk.

01:50.520 --> 01:52.363
You are now declaring...

01:52.400 --> 01:56.200
that PC Rod Kennedy killed
Sergeant Daniel Waldron'?

01:56.240 --> 01:59.005
- Yes, sir.
- Rod killed Danny.

02:01.520 --> 02:03.602
(Patter of rain)

02:19.400 --> 02:21.209
Look, I'm sorry about this.

02:21.240 --> 02:23.641
It's just I've got no-one else
to talk to right now.

02:23.680 --> 02:25.364
It's fine.

02:28.400 --> 02:32.121
Look, mate, I don't think I can
keep going into the station.

02:32.160 --> 02:34.561
All the stuff that's going on
behind our backs,

02:34.600 --> 02:37.046
all the stuff
that's going on to our faces.

02:37.080 --> 02:39.481
Well, Rod was a good bloke,
wasn't he'?

02:39.520 --> 02:41.682
People can't get their heads
round it.

02:42.440 --> 02:45.523
Yeah. I can see why.

02:50.120 --> 02:51.884
Jackie,
don't do this to yourself.

02:53.200 --> 02:56.886
My hands were on that gun and
I felt Rod force the trigger.

02:59.520 --> 03:00.965
He killed Danny.

03:02.760 --> 03:05.206
It was right to stick together
when he was here,

03:05.240 --> 03:08.449
but now he's gone...
we've got to move on.

03:11.560 --> 03:13.164
Aw, come here.

03:29.320 --> 03:31.402
- (Phone rings)
- Superintendent Hastings.

03:31.440 --> 03:33.169
<i>Hi. Sorry to bother you, sir.</i>

03:33.200 --> 03:36.124
I just followed Jackie Brickford
to a meeting with Hari Bains.

03:36.160 --> 03:38.128
He seems pretty bloody shifty
to me.

03:43.360 --> 03:46.091
Dot. Just so you know,

03:46.120 --> 03:48.964
I've authorised Kate to adopt
direct surveillance on Bains.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.731
- Nice one, gaffer.
- And I want Steve in on it too.

03:51.760 --> 03:53.330
- Absolutely.
- Steve...

03:54.120 --> 03:58.205
Get yourself over to South Ferry
when Hari Bains comes on shift.

03:58.240 --> 03:59.924
- Be visible.
- Sir.

04:11.640 --> 04:13.369
(Text alert)

04:31.760 --> 04:33.888
- Come in.
- Inspector McAndrew.

04:33.920 --> 04:37.288
- DS Arnott, AC-12.
- What do you want'?

04:42.200 --> 04:43.884
In an interview
you gave at AC-12,

04:43.920 --> 04:46.685
you told us that Hari Bains had
a good working relationship

04:46.720 --> 04:49.087
- with Danny Waldron.
- Er, yeah. So'?

04:49.120 --> 04:51.122
Hari never made any complaints
about Danny'?

04:51.160 --> 04:53.561
- If anything, the opposite.
- How so, ma'am'?

04:53.600 --> 04:56.683
I was due to rotate Hari
from Danny's squad,

04:56.720 --> 04:59.121
but Hari said he respected
Danny's professionalism

04:59.160 --> 05:03.768
- and wanted to ride with him.
- Really? When did he say this'?

05:03.800 --> 05:06.167
A couple of days before
the Abbotts Lane op.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.320
A couple of days before the op
that got Danny killed?

05:09.360 --> 05:13.001
I was all set to disband Danny's
team after Murphy's shooting.

05:13.040 --> 05:16.123
And there is no way you're gonna
pin some blame on me

05:16.160 --> 05:18.322
just because you need to find
a scapegoat.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.727
Thank you, ma'am.
You've been very helpful.

06:05.080 --> 06:06.411
(Ringing tone)

06:06.440 --> 06:08.283
- AC-12.
- DC Fleming.

06:08.320 --> 06:10.891
Put me through to
Telecommunications, please.

06:10.920 --> 06:12.126
- Telecoms.
- DC Fleming.

06:12.160 --> 06:15.289
I need an ID on the last number
dialled from a pay phone

06:15.320 --> 06:18.324
on the corner of Calman Road
and Turner Road.

06:18.360 --> 06:19.566
<i>Stand by.</i>

06:19.600 --> 06:22.206
<i>The number you have called
is not recognised.</i>

06:22.240 --> 06:24.481
<i>Please check the number.</i>

06:24.520 --> 06:26.284
The number you have called is...

06:31.720 --> 06:35.361
Kate reports Bains attempting
to make a call to this number.

06:35.400 --> 06:38.051
It relates to an unregistered
pay-as-you-go mobile.

06:38.080 --> 06:39.764
The call couldn't be connected

06:39.800 --> 06:42.963
because either the phone or
the SIM card was out of service.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.207
Maneet's liaising with
the network provider

06:45.240 --> 06:47.083
for information about
the number.

06:47.120 --> 06:48.645
Great.

06:48.680 --> 06:51.411
Tell Kate I want her on
Hari Bains round the clock.

06:51.440 --> 06:53.363
Yeah. Will do, gaffer.

07:08.960 --> 07:10.530
(Phone rings)

07:15.360 --> 07:17.362
<i>- Hello'?</i>
MAN: <i>What are you doing</i>

07:17.400 --> 07:19.050
<i>making a call from a public box'?</i>

07:19.080 --> 07:21.048
<i>That's why we send
unregistered mobiles!</i>

07:21.080 --> 07:23.242
The text came through
to my own phone, so...

07:23.280 --> 07:27.080
<i>We had to get a message to you
urgently. You weren't answering.</i>

07:27.120 --> 07:28.565
<i>You're being watched by AC-12.</i>

07:28.600 --> 07:31.524
- I <i>didn't</i> see <i>anyone.</i>
- <i>What did the text say?</i>

07:31.560 --> 07:34.211
- "Sit tight. Act normal."
- So how is this acting normal?

07:34.240 --> 07:35.969
<i>Dickhead.</i>

07:45.240 --> 07:46.890
- All right'?
- All right'?

07:46.920 --> 07:48.922
Look. For my two-pen'th,

07:48.960 --> 07:51.440
We're flogging a dead horse
with Bains and Brickford.

07:51.480 --> 07:53.960
Rod Kennedy killed
Danny Waldron,

07:54.000 --> 07:56.048
couldn't handle the guilt,
topped himself.

07:56.080 --> 07:57.366
Maybe it wasn't suicide.

07:57.400 --> 08:00.449
We ought to request a second
postmortem on Kennedy's body.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.721
The first one
only looked for cause of death.

08:02.760 --> 08:05.570
We should get a pathologist
looking for evidence of crime.

08:07.240 --> 08:08.924
Sure. Leave that with me.

08:08.960 --> 08:10.166
Cheers.

08:10.840 --> 08:15.687
Do you like chilli'?
The food, not the country.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.768
I've got a pot...on the simmer.

08:21.560 --> 08:22.686
You've probably eaten.

08:23.960 --> 08:27.282
- No, I haven't, actually.
- Well...

08:28.200 --> 08:29.406
Yeah.

08:32.360 --> 08:34.442
- Not too fiery'?
- I'll cope.

08:35.760 --> 08:38.331
If you go to the trouble
of making a pot,

08:38.360 --> 08:40.931
you might as well
make it last a few days.

08:40.960 --> 08:42.724
One night
you can have it with rice,

08:42.760 --> 08:44.444
one night baked potato...

08:44.480 --> 08:47.563
- (She chuckles)
- It's rock'n'roll, me.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.170
Well, I'm not complaining.

08:49.200 --> 08:51.771
When I knockoff, the only thing
open's a dodgy kebab.

08:51.800 --> 08:54.804
That's undercover, isn't it'?
Stupid hours.

08:54.840 --> 08:57.411
Well, Mark works in IT.

08:57.440 --> 09:00.444
He did a lot from home,
which was great for childcare.

09:00.480 --> 09:02.005
Just not so great for us.

09:02.760 --> 09:05.001
- You still see the kid, though?
- Yeah.

09:06.640 --> 09:09.211
Sorry,
I shouldn't poke my nose in.

09:09.240 --> 09:11.720
No, it's fine.
It was the right decision,

09:11.760 --> 09:14.001
you know -
give him security and stability.

09:15.040 --> 09:17.361
Just not such a great decision
for me, to be honest.

09:17.400 --> 09:20.051
See, me and my missus, we never
got round to having kids.

09:20.080 --> 09:22.401
- Was she a copper too'?
- Forensics.

09:22.440 --> 09:24.681
- I don't see much of her now.
- No'?

09:24.720 --> 09:27.564
I was on the piss most nights.
Couldn't pass a bookies

09:28.720 --> 09:31.530
Final straw was, we put down
half on a fortnight in Majorca.

09:31.560 --> 09:34.325
- Oh, don't tell me.
- Yeah, five-to-one.

09:34.360 --> 09:35.930
Dead cert.

09:35.960 --> 09:38.327
I couldn't go home
to face the music, so...

09:39.000 --> 09:40.729
I took out a loan,

09:40.760 --> 09:42.967
put a grand down
on the last race of the day,

09:43.000 --> 09:45.002
try and win it all back.

09:48.040 --> 09:51.203
- Barrel of laughs, me!
- (Chuckles)

09:51.240 --> 09:53.242
- Can I have your bowl'?
- Cheers.

10:08.080 --> 10:10.128
There's seconds here
if you fancy.

10:10.160 --> 10:12.640
Any more
and I won't get off this sofa.

10:23.440 --> 10:25.807
(Phone rings)

10:27.840 --> 10:29.604
- Yeah.
- I've got something for you.

10:29.640 --> 10:31.642
<i>On that photo found at Danny's.</i>

10:31.680 --> 10:32.966
Yeah. Sure.

10:34.040 --> 10:35.963
It's from a boys' home
called Sands View.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.082
Danny Waldron's mum died
when he was 11.

10:38.120 --> 10:40.168
He went to live with his dad
and step-mum,

10:40.200 --> 10:42.851
but that didn't work out
and he got taken into care.

10:42.880 --> 10:46.362
Danny was at Sands View from
the age of 13 until he was 17.

10:46.400 --> 10:47.970
I keep going through the file.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.604
There's no link to Ronan Murphy

10:49.640 --> 10:51.483
while Danny was
a police officer.

10:51.520 --> 10:53.522
The only link must be
this boys' home.

10:53.560 --> 10:56.325
I can't get hold of any records
for that period.

10:56.360 --> 10:58.601
One department told me
they were lost in a fire.

10:58.640 --> 11:01.120
Another told me they went
missing during a move.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.810
You think lost on purpose?

11:02.840 --> 11:04.763
Who knows?
The lads were chucked out at 17

11:04.800 --> 11:07.724
and pretty much left to fend for
themselves, with no follow-up.

11:07.760 --> 11:11.526
However, I've cross-checked
with individuals in the system,

11:11.560 --> 11:14.006
and I've got a name for you.
Same age as Danny,

11:14.040 --> 11:16.327
so chances are they were there
at the same time.

11:17.440 --> 11:19.442
Good work.

11:19.480 --> 11:21.482
(Clatter and whir of machines)

11:28.640 --> 11:31.928
(Muffled) Joe, someone here
to talk to you.

11:32.800 --> 11:34.689
- Joseph Nash'?
- Yeah.

11:34.720 --> 11:37.564
Can I talk to you
somewhere quieter, please?

11:38.560 --> 11:40.562
Yeah.

11:48.760 --> 11:51.240
I'd like to show you a
photograph, if that's all right?

11:52.640 --> 11:55.291
It's a photocopy
of an original image

11:55.320 --> 11:57.641
believed to be approximately
15 to 20 years old.

12:01.560 --> 12:03.642
- Do you recognise the image'?
- Yeah.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.207
- Do you recall the location?
- Yes.

12:09.400 --> 12:11.482
Mr Nash,
you're not in any trouble.

12:11.520 --> 12:14.524
- How did you find out my name'?
- I'm not gonna lie.

12:14.560 --> 12:16.801
You committed
a number of minor offences.

12:16.840 --> 12:18.842
I was just a kid back then.

12:18.880 --> 12:20.644
I've put my life
back together now.

12:20.680 --> 12:22.728
The convictions are spent.

12:22.760 --> 12:26.810
Your record cross-checked with
an inquiry I'm involved with.

12:31.920 --> 12:33.922
An inquiry into Sands View'?

12:33.960 --> 12:35.962
Connected to Sands View.

12:37.720 --> 12:39.722
Do you recognise
this individual'?

12:40.720 --> 12:42.609
- Yes. Danny.
- Danny Waldron'?

12:42.640 --> 12:44.404
Yeah.

12:44.440 --> 12:46.090
Do you recognise
this individual'?

12:46.120 --> 12:48.122
Yes.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.810
What do you remember
about that person?

12:51.840 --> 12:54.161
He took us for football
on a Tuesday afternoon.

12:54.200 --> 12:56.806
- He was one of the staff?
- No. Just took us for footie.

12:57.920 --> 13:00.161
What else do you recall
about him'?

13:02.840 --> 13:04.842
You're being a big help, Joe.

13:06.240 --> 13:08.561
Is it OK if I ask you
about one more person?

13:10.800 --> 13:13.201
This man here. Him.

13:14.440 --> 13:16.442
Who is he'?

13:17.920 --> 13:19.809
Mr Murphy. He was the caretaker.

13:20.440 --> 13:22.886
The other man -
the football coach -

13:22.920 --> 13:24.445
was his name Murphy too'?

13:24.480 --> 13:26.482
Might have been.

13:27.080 --> 13:29.321
- They was a pair.
- A pair'?

13:33.880 --> 13:36.531
The older one, the caretaker,
he had the keys.

13:38.480 --> 13:40.562
For the dormitories.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.523
Changing rooms. The basement.

13:44.160 --> 13:45.685
But him, the younger one,

13:47.200 --> 13:49.009
he was in on it too.

13:49.720 --> 13:51.609
With the others.

13:51.640 --> 13:53.688
What others?

13:53.720 --> 13:55.722
Not in the photo.

13:56.880 --> 13:58.882
Visitors.

14:00.360 --> 14:03.170
We got told
they were very important people

14:03.200 --> 14:06.488
and we had to do exactly...
what they said.

14:07.160 --> 14:09.481
Did you ever get the names
of any of these people?

14:09.520 --> 14:12.171
No. No-one ever got any names.

14:12.200 --> 14:16.125
And even if we did,
it was just...Mr Smith.

14:18.560 --> 14:20.324
What happened
with these visitors?

14:26.720 --> 14:28.722
Well, sometimes they'd...

14:30.280 --> 14:32.931
They'd come to the home
and we'd be told it was like...

14:32.960 --> 14:34.962
a private interview.

14:36.200 --> 14:39.602
"Mr Smith can be a big help
to you when you move on."

14:39.640 --> 14:41.642
You know.

14:43.400 --> 14:45.767
And then you'd go to a room
with Mr Smith.

14:51.800 --> 14:53.802
Or a few of you would.

14:55.440 --> 14:57.681
With a few of them.

14:57.720 --> 15:00.087
The abuse always took place
within Sands View'?

15:00.120 --> 15:02.691
No, not always. There was...

15:02.720 --> 15:05.007
Sometimes there'd be
a car or a minibus

15:05.040 --> 15:07.646
and they'd take us to a hotel
or a guesthouse

15:07.680 --> 15:09.682
or some big...

15:11.360 --> 15:13.886
some big private home.
You know'?

15:15.480 --> 15:17.482
But the parties...

15:19.440 --> 15:21.886
The parties,
they were the worst.

15:21.920 --> 15:23.285
Parties'?

15:23.320 --> 15:25.800
There'd be a few of them,
these VIPs...

15:30.080 --> 15:32.082
And we'd be farmed out.

15:35.120 --> 15:37.805
Do you recall any details
in terms of names,

15:37.840 --> 15:39.729
addresses or the people
who drove you'?

15:39.760 --> 15:42.331
This was a long time ago,
all right, mate'?

15:42.360 --> 15:45.603
And I wish I could remember that
information and forget the rest.

15:45.640 --> 15:48.246
But...it's the opposite.

15:49.960 --> 15:51.962
I know this is hard, Joe.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.401
But is there anything
you can tell me about them

15:55.440 --> 15:57.522
that might help identify them'?

16:02.400 --> 16:04.448
Yeah, there's one of them
stands out.

16:07.280 --> 16:09.362
He's...

16:09.400 --> 16:11.402
He's a big...

16:11.440 --> 16:13.522
big fat whale of a fella.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.802
He always wore a suit.

16:17.880 --> 16:20.360
And when he took
the suit jacket off,

16:20.400 --> 16:23.290
he always had these,
these...these sweat patches

16:23.320 --> 16:25.322
and he stank of it.

16:27.280 --> 16:30.409
And when I got told
he'd asked for me again, I'd...

16:30.440 --> 16:34.684
I'd throw up, you know.
I'd... I'd be sick.

16:38.760 --> 16:40.285
Is Danny the one'?

16:41.440 --> 16:43.807
- The one'?
- Yeah.

16:44.680 --> 16:46.967
He's got people
listening to us at last.

16:47.680 --> 16:50.809
Yeah. Yeah, he is.

17:12.760 --> 17:14.728
- Arnott.
- Any report on the second PM?

17:14.760 --> 17:16.000
What second PM'?

17:16.040 --> 17:18.041
Dot said he'd organise
a second postmortem

17:18.079 --> 17:19.491
on Rod Kennedy.

17:19.520 --> 17:22.251
First I've heard of it.
Leave it with me.

17:22.280 --> 17:24.123
OK.
I'll head back to South Ferry.

17:43.240 --> 17:45.322
McANDREW: Right. I'll tell her.

17:48.840 --> 17:51.002
Francis, that was your rep.

17:51.040 --> 17:53.805
AC-12 want you in for interview
straightaway.

18:14.200 --> 18:17.249
- She doesn't know anything.
- She never believed us.

18:17.280 --> 18:20.887
Jackie. She weren't in the room
when Danny was shot.

18:20.920 --> 18:23.207
But he whispered something
to her as he was dying.

18:23.240 --> 18:26.130
Yeah. And if he'd managed
to tell her the truth,

18:26.160 --> 18:28.925
do you think she would have
kept quiet this whole time?

18:30.080 --> 18:32.162
No.

18:33.200 --> 18:35.601
Trust me.
She don't know anything.

18:35.640 --> 18:37.642
Yeah'?

18:39.120 --> 18:41.122
All right, mate.

18:49.640 --> 18:52.450
I've continued to search records
relating to Sands View.

18:52.480 --> 18:55.768
Joseph Nash claims a number
of his abusers were VIPs,

18:55.800 --> 18:58.406
all of whom used
the same alias - Mr Smith.

18:58.440 --> 19:00.488
Hence Nash wasn't able
to give us any names.

19:00.520 --> 19:05.401
But he did claim one of these
abusers was extremely obese.

19:06.760 --> 19:08.364
Sports Day at Sands View.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.002
- Who is he'?
- Dale Roach,

19:14.040 --> 19:16.247
leader of the city council
during the period

19:16.280 --> 19:19.841
Danny Waldron and Joe Nash
were residents at Sands View.

19:21.840 --> 19:23.285
Is this the man, Joe'?

19:27.960 --> 19:29.724
Yeah, that's him.

19:29.760 --> 19:31.762
Thank you.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.565
Now, it would help if you could
come to my department

19:35.600 --> 19:38.410
and look through some images
of other individuals...

19:42.440 --> 19:44.807
Joe,
I came from a loving family.

19:44.840 --> 19:47.491
I had a nice childhood
and I can't begin to imagine

19:47.520 --> 19:50.126
- what yours was like.
- 20 years...

19:52.000 --> 19:54.367
- ...it's took you to come.
- I want to help.

19:54.400 --> 19:58.530
20 years...I’ve had
that monster in my head.

19:59.880 --> 20:02.121
The sounds he made.
The smell of him.

20:03.160 --> 20:06.243
And the things that he did to us
at Sands View...

20:08.520 --> 20:10.648
No copper ever gave a toss.

20:13.440 --> 20:15.204
So offences committed
at Sands View

20:15.240 --> 20:18.084
were reported to police,
and no action was taken'?

20:18.120 --> 20:19.884
We told teachers,

20:19.920 --> 20:24.562
we told social workers
and, yeah, we told coppers.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.762
And then we learned not to.

20:26.800 --> 20:29.007
Danny Waldron's dead, Joe.

20:30.880 --> 20:34.009
He was killed going after
the people who did this to you.

20:35.640 --> 20:38.041
Danny's mission
is now my mission.

20:38.080 --> 20:40.924
And I promise you
I will get these bastards.

21:09.760 --> 21:11.205
Daddy, Daddy!

21:11.240 --> 21:13.447
Hey! Hello, you!

21:13.480 --> 21:14.766
- Is that for me'?
- Mm-hm.

21:14.800 --> 21:16.484
Thank you very much.

21:20.040 --> 21:22.771
I will always,
always love you, OK'?

21:22.800 --> 21:23.881
Mm-hm.

21:23.920 --> 21:25.922
Come here.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.765
- How long has he been here'?
- I'd have to check.

21:37.800 --> 21:39.643
Two or three years at least.

21:40.800 --> 21:44.247
- Any family'?
- No family, no visitors.

22:00.080 --> 22:01.286
Mr Roach?

22:03.760 --> 22:05.250
Mr Roach?

22:06.600 --> 22:09.331
- Can he hear me'?
- He doesn't understand much.

22:09.360 --> 22:11.806
- Can't talk.
- What's wrong with him'?

22:12.440 --> 22:14.681
Massive stroke.

22:17.720 --> 22:19.768
Sorry, do you need me to stay'?

22:19.800 --> 22:22.041
No. Thank you.

22:22.080 --> 22:23.889
Call if you need me.

22:39.800 --> 22:42.883
Mr Roach, do you recognise the
name Sands View Boys' Home'?

22:48.320 --> 22:51.085
Mr Roach.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.327
I'm Detective Sergeant
Steve Arnott.

22:54.400 --> 22:57.290
I'm investigating claims
relating to Sands View.

22:58.360 --> 23:00.442
Do you understand me'?

23:03.600 --> 23:06.251
I know what you did
to those boys.

23:33.920 --> 23:35.843
Danny Waldron recognised
Ronan Murphy

23:35.880 --> 23:38.451
as a sports volunteer at
Sands View Boys' Home.

23:38.480 --> 23:42.405
Somehow, from Ronan, he was able
to track down Linus Murphy.

23:43.280 --> 23:46.011
Linus was the caretaker at
Sands View who used his position

23:46.040 --> 23:48.611
to include Ronan, his nephew,
in his activities.

23:49.920 --> 23:53.367
Now a witness has given us
another name - Dale Roach.

23:53.400 --> 23:55.243
Councillor Dale Roach.

23:56.640 --> 23:59.325
Unfortunately Roach
isn't fit to stand trial.

23:59.360 --> 24:02.842
I think Danny Waldron purposely
created a trail of evidence

24:02.880 --> 24:05.611
that led us to connect him
to Linus Murphy's murder.

24:06.360 --> 24:09.250
Now we're on the trail
of the other abusers.

24:12.360 --> 24:15.011
There's only one thing
we're interested in here, son,

24:15.040 --> 24:16.929
and one thing only.

24:18.920 --> 24:20.365
And that's bent coppers.

24:20.400 --> 24:24.405
The boys made complaints, some
allegedly to police officers.

24:27.200 --> 24:28.804
Thank you, Steve.

24:31.680 --> 24:33.523
Sir.

24:35.200 --> 24:37.282
(Intercom rings)

24:42.560 --> 24:44.642
(Ringing)

24:45.960 --> 24:48.167
- Hi.
- Kate'?

24:49.440 --> 24:51.044
- Come in.
- (Buzzer)

25:05.440 --> 25:07.283
Something wrong'?

25:07.320 --> 25:09.402
You didn't come back
to the station.

25:09.440 --> 25:11.807
By the time I was done with
AC-12, my shift was over.

25:12.440 --> 25:13.851
So what's going on'?

25:13.880 --> 25:17.202
They just wanted to go over the
details of the day Danny died,

25:17.240 --> 25:19.163
times, places...

25:19.200 --> 25:21.965
You know what they're like,
fishing for inconsistencies,

25:22.000 --> 25:23.490
anything they can pounce on.

25:23.520 --> 25:25.204
- And did they?
- Did they what'?

25:25.240 --> 25:26.446
Pounce?

25:27.880 --> 25:30.531
- We shouldn't talk about this.
- What did you tell them'?

25:31.480 --> 25:33.209
We can't do this.
You should leave.

25:33.240 --> 25:35.288
I need to know!

25:36.120 --> 25:37.884
You keep asking me
to leave you alone.

25:37.920 --> 25:39.649
Congratulations.
You're on your own.

25:39.680 --> 25:42.445
- What do they know, Kate'?
- You should go.

25:43.040 --> 25:44.565
What do they know'?

25:45.480 --> 25:47.482
They're onto the pair of you.

25:50.880 --> 25:52.803
What about us'?

25:53.560 --> 25:56.609
They know Hari stopped McAndrew
from disbanding Danny's squad.

25:56.640 --> 25:58.005
What'?

25:59.360 --> 26:01.044
I never knew
anything about that!

26:01.080 --> 26:02.605
They know about the phone calls.

26:02.640 --> 26:05.530
- What phone calls?
- Right, "What phone calls?"

26:05.560 --> 26:07.403
- Bye, Jackie.
- What phone calls, Kate'?

26:09.760 --> 26:11.842
They've got Hari making calls
from a phone box

26:11.880 --> 26:14.451
to an unregistered
pay-as-you-go number.

26:14.480 --> 26:17.529
They know it must be
a phone you're using covertly.

26:17.560 --> 26:20.211
You two are in collusion
and developing your strategy

26:20.240 --> 26:21.890
using untraceable phone calls.

26:21.920 --> 26:24.810
It's not me he's been calling!

26:36.080 --> 26:37.764
(Doorbell rings)

26:42.760 --> 26:44.000
Stay here. I'll get it.

26:57.040 --> 26:58.451
So, what's up, then'?

26:59.280 --> 27:01.647
- Who have you been calling'?
- What?

27:01.680 --> 27:04.331
AC-12 know about your dodgy
calls. They think I'm in on it!

27:05.760 --> 27:08.889
All this time, we trusted you.
It was just the three of us!

27:08.920 --> 27:10.922
Rod's dead,
and that still isn't the end!

27:10.960 --> 27:12.564
Jackie, what...

27:13.440 --> 27:16.125
Who have you been making
those calls to'?

27:16.160 --> 27:19.130
- What aren't you telling me'?
- I haven't been making calls!

27:19.160 --> 27:21.606
It's just me and you.
As long as we stick together...

27:23.200 --> 27:25.806
Jackie, I've been telling you
the truth!

27:27.880 --> 27:29.882
(Steady rain)

27:47.640 --> 27:49.290
(Ringing tone)

27:51.960 --> 27:53.962
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I know it's late.

27:55.440 --> 27:57.442
I need to go in and see AC-12.

27:59.280 --> 28:01.442
And I'm gonna need a solicitor.

28:09.440 --> 28:11.363
- Stand away from the door.
- (Buzzer)

28:18.440 --> 28:20.442
(Lively chatter)

28:39.880 --> 28:41.962
Ms Denton,
you remain under oath.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.002
Thank you, My Lady.

28:46.280 --> 28:48.044
Ms Denton,

28:48.080 --> 28:51.084
in your examination-in-chief
by your own counsel,

28:51.120 --> 28:54.169
you made a number of references
to an undercover operation

28:54.200 --> 28:56.123
conducted by
Detective Sergeant Arnott

28:56.160 --> 28:58.731
- of Anticorruption Unit 12?
- Yes, I did.

28:58.760 --> 29:01.650
Did any of these operations
involve DS Arnott

29:01.680 --> 29:04.763
- being present at your home'?
- Some did.

29:04.800 --> 29:07.280
You were alone with DS Arnott'?

29:07.320 --> 29:08.526
Sometimes.

29:08.560 --> 29:11.803
And there were never other
police officers in the vicinity?

29:11.840 --> 29:14.286
There was a constable stationed
outside the house.

29:14.320 --> 29:16.482
- Where outside?
- On the doorstep.

29:16.520 --> 29:18.887
And where did sexual relations
take place?

29:18.920 --> 29:20.331
In the bedroom.

29:20.360 --> 29:22.010
And how was the bedroom
accessed?

29:22.720 --> 29:24.927
Via the stairs.

29:24.960 --> 29:28.362
And how far do the stairs lie
from the front door'?

29:28.400 --> 29:31.131
I don't know. Three or four
metres from the front door.

29:31.160 --> 29:35.006
From the plans of your home
obtained by the prosecution,

29:35.040 --> 29:38.487
the distance is...2.7 metres.

29:38.520 --> 29:42.764
- If you say so.
- I don't say so. It's a fact.

29:42.800 --> 29:45.201
And if I'm inaccurate,
I'll be corrected.

29:47.240 --> 29:49.481
There are written statements
by all the officers

29:49.520 --> 29:52.171
stationed outside the door
in early October,

29:52.200 --> 29:54.202
and not one recalls hearing

29:54.240 --> 29:56.811
you and DS Arnott
go upstairs together.

29:56.840 --> 29:58.365
Well, that doesn't surprise me.

29:58.400 --> 30:01.131
It doesn't surprise you that
trained police officers,

30:01.160 --> 30:04.243
on guard duty,
in a high state of vigilance,

30:04.280 --> 30:06.726
don't hear the two of you
go upstairs for sex

30:06.760 --> 30:09.843
when he or she is less than
three metres away'?

30:09.880 --> 30:11.609
We were discreet.

30:11.640 --> 30:13.768
Hm.

30:13.800 --> 30:15.404
You've told the jury

30:15.440 --> 30:19.047
that this intimacy
with DS Arnott won your trust,

30:19.080 --> 30:20.650
and therefore you permitted him

30:20.680 --> 30:22.603
unsupervised access
to your home.

30:22.640 --> 30:25.120
There were times when I was
napping, or in the shower,

30:25.160 --> 30:26.889
and he was free
to roam the premises.

30:26.920 --> 30:28.570
I trusted him completely.

30:28.600 --> 30:31.365
And you've alleged that
en one of these occasions

30:31.400 --> 30:34.006
Detective Sergeant Arnott
planted a sum of money

30:34.040 --> 30:36.202
in your late mother's
overnight case.

30:37.720 --> 30:39.563
Did you witness DS Arnott

30:39.600 --> 30:41.443
bringing the £50,000
into your home'?

30:41.480 --> 30:43.881
- No.
- Did you ever witness him

30:43.920 --> 30:47.163
having access to tens of
thousands of pounds in cash'?

30:47.200 --> 30:48.531
He'd hardly do it openly.

30:48.560 --> 30:51.370
Corrupt officers have access
to criminal contacts.

30:51.400 --> 30:53.880
Please answer the question
you've been asked.

30:55.800 --> 30:58.246
Did you ever witness
Detective Sergeant Arnott

30:58.280 --> 31:01.921
with such an enormous sum
of cash'?

31:01.960 --> 31:04.247
I don't know how Steve Arnott
got hold of the money

31:04.280 --> 31:06.806
- and then got it into my house.
- You've answered.

31:06.840 --> 31:10.049
L'm still answering. lf I'm
inaccurate, I'll be corrected.

31:10.080 --> 31:11.809
(Whispers)
The nerve of that one.

31:12.400 --> 31:14.289
Steve Arnott had
my complete trust

31:14.320 --> 31:16.288
and the trust of the officers
on guard duty.

31:16.320 --> 31:19.005
He could easily have picked
his moment to plant the money,

31:19.040 --> 31:22.089
and I firmly believe that
that is the best explanation

31:22.120 --> 31:23.406
for how it came to be there,

31:23.440 --> 31:26.410
because I had never seen
that money before.

31:27.440 --> 31:30.728
Were you aware that you were
under investigation by AC-i 2'?

31:30.760 --> 31:32.046
Yes, I was.

31:32.080 --> 31:34.048
And were you co-operating'?

31:34.080 --> 31:35.366
Yes, I was.

31:35.400 --> 31:37.129
You were being completely honest

31:37.160 --> 31:39.128
in assisting them
with their inquiries?

31:39.160 --> 31:42.084
- Yes, I was.
- Had you always been honest

31:42.120 --> 31:44.202
with Anticorruption Unit 12'?

31:52.200 --> 31:54.248
Please answer, Ms Denton.

31:54.280 --> 31:56.169
It was a complex case

31:56.200 --> 31:58.362
and there were many details
that were elusive

31:58.400 --> 32:00.971
and at times required further
thought and examination

32:01.000 --> 32:03.321
before I could give
a definitive answer.

32:03.360 --> 32:06.125
Did you lie
in relation to matters

32:06.160 --> 32:09.164
surrounding the conspiracy
to murder Tommy Hunter?

32:14.640 --> 32:16.130
Ms Denton...

32:18.720 --> 32:21.530
As I said, it was a complex case

32:21.560 --> 32:24.166
and many details were difficult
to define or recollect.

32:24.200 --> 32:26.521
Did you lie about having
prior knowledge of Hunter?

32:26.560 --> 32:27.971
No.

32:28.440 --> 32:31.284
You lied about having prior
knowledge of Hunter, didn't you'?

32:31.320 --> 32:32.970
- No.
- You told the investigators

32:33.000 --> 32:34.650
lie after lie to confound them

32:34.680 --> 32:36.523
and to pervert
the course of justice.

32:36.560 --> 32:38.881
- It wasn't like that.
- It was like that.

32:39.680 --> 32:42.729
You wove a web of deceit to
confound the investigators

32:42.760 --> 32:44.125
and to protect yourself.

32:44.160 --> 32:46.970
And you've the effrontery to
attempt to deceive this jury!

32:47.000 --> 32:48.490
- No!
- Did you fabricate

32:48.520 --> 32:50.727
the improper relations
between you and DS Arnott'?

32:50.760 --> 32:51.841
No.

32:51.880 --> 32:53.609
- The planting of evidence'?
- No.

32:53.640 --> 32:56.166
Lindsay Denton, aren't you
an artful, devious person

32:56.200 --> 32:58.123
who has betrayed the trust
placed in her'?

32:58.160 --> 32:59.730
- No!
- Haven't you repeatedly

32:59.760 --> 33:02.843
connived to obstruct those
who would bring you to justice?

33:02.880 --> 33:04.405
No, I haven't!

33:15.640 --> 33:18.041
Watching that circus
really turned my stomach.

33:21.080 --> 33:24.004
Listen, I owe you an apology
for the other night.

33:24.040 --> 33:26.771
Your...dinner invitation.

33:27.800 --> 33:30.406
- You're a married man.
- This is it.

33:31.280 --> 33:33.487
But here we are,
two colleagues having a drink

33:33.520 --> 33:36.046
and the sky
hasn't fallen in yet.

33:38.360 --> 33:40.124
Yeah...

33:40.920 --> 33:42.081
Yeah.

34:05.880 --> 34:09.168
This is a voluntary interview
by authorised firearms officer

34:09.199 --> 34:10.565
Victor Charlie 53

34:10.600 --> 34:13.251
in the presence of her
Police Federation representative

34:13.280 --> 34:16.601
and solicitor, by Superintendent
Hastings and DS Arnott.

34:17.760 --> 34:19.250
I want to cooperate.

34:20.880 --> 34:25.010
I want to go on record that
I have never at any time engaged

34:25.040 --> 34:28.123
with any other officer
in covert telecommunications

34:28.159 --> 34:30.242
to knowingly mislead
lawful inquiries.

34:30.800 --> 34:32.802
Glad to hear it.

34:33.679 --> 34:37.480
I also want to clarify...
some details...

34:38.239 --> 34:39.810
previous statements made

34:39.840 --> 34:43.128
regarding the death of
Sergeant Daniel Waldron.

34:43.760 --> 34:46.047
Very good. Carry on.

34:48.960 --> 34:52.362
I never saw the exact moment
the struggle started...

34:53.960 --> 34:57.089
...the struggle for the gun
that killed Daniel Waldron.

34:57.120 --> 34:58.201
Neither did Rod.

35:00.120 --> 35:04.762
We had to rely on what Hari...
on what Five Four told us.

35:06.640 --> 35:09.803
He said that Danny had entered
the room with his firearm drawn

35:09.840 --> 35:11.604
and that he turned
the gun on Five Four.

35:11.640 --> 35:14.610
So you're saying
Danny tried to kill Five Four'?

35:14.640 --> 35:17.246
I'm saying that's only
what Five Four told us.

35:18.560 --> 35:20.688
He said that Danny turned
the gun on him.

35:21.280 --> 35:23.044
Five Four made a grab
for the firearm

35:23.080 --> 35:25.048
to stop Danny
from shooting him.

35:25.200 --> 35:26.770
There was a struggle
for the gun.

35:26.800 --> 35:28.848
Rod and I joined in
that struggle.

35:30.200 --> 35:32.168
The gun went off
and killed Danny.

35:32.200 --> 35:33.690
HASTINGS: Hang on a second.

35:33.720 --> 35:36.530
This is going way beyond
clarifying a statement.

35:37.880 --> 35:41.407
You are changing your story
all over again here.

35:42.200 --> 35:44.202
This is the truth, sir.

35:44.800 --> 35:46.609
Well, you need to take
a deep breath...

35:47.400 --> 35:49.641
...and we need to caution you.

35:49.680 --> 35:51.682
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence

35:51.720 --> 35:53.210
if you fail to mention,
when questioned,

35:53.240 --> 35:55.004
something you later
rely on in court

35:55.040 --> 35:58.362
Anything you do say may be used
in evidence. Do you understand?

35:58.400 --> 35:59.765
I understand.

35:59.800 --> 36:04.203
So now you're saying that Danny
wasn't trying to kill himself.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.571
He was trying to kill
Victor Charlie Five Four,

36:07.600 --> 36:10.046
- or so Five Four claimed.
- Yes, sir.

36:10.080 --> 36:12.970
- That seemed plausible.
- Why'?

36:15.120 --> 36:17.168
Danny was bullying us
into covering for him

36:17.200 --> 36:19.407
after he shot a suspect.

36:20.360 --> 36:22.203
He moved
the suspect's firearm...

36:23.040 --> 36:26.089
...and discharged the weapon,
narrowly missing Five Four.

36:26.120 --> 36:27.770
You conspired with
Daniel Waldron

36:27.800 --> 36:30.280
to provide false statements
regarding the shooting'?

36:31.520 --> 36:32.646
Yes, sir.

36:33.840 --> 36:36.081
We were all
really scared of Danny.

36:36.120 --> 36:38.441
A pan of him was capable
of doing anything.

36:38.480 --> 36:40.209
- So you killed him'?
- No.

36:40.240 --> 36:42.004
It seemed like an accident.

36:45.920 --> 36:48.844
Five Four convinced me and Rod

36:48.880 --> 36:51.247
that if we said we'd killed
Danny in self-defence,

36:51.280 --> 36:53.647
that the least we'd get
would be manslaughter.

36:54.360 --> 36:58.206
He told us to claim that we were
trying to save Danny.

36:59.160 --> 37:01.367
And that way nobody could
blame us for his death.

37:01.400 --> 37:04.051
But instead of telling the
truth, the three of you went off

37:04.080 --> 37:06.162
and concocted a whole new
version of events.

37:06.200 --> 37:09.647
And then you decided to blame
Rod Kennedy for Danny's death.

37:10.440 --> 37:12.442
I knew Rod was jealous of Danny.

37:13.080 --> 37:15.447
It seemed plausible that
he could have been the one.

37:15.480 --> 37:17.164
You don't believe that any more'?

37:17.720 --> 37:19.165
No, sir.

37:19.960 --> 37:23.328
Five Four initiated the struggle
with that gun...

37:24.200 --> 37:26.885
...and it's only his word for it
that it was self-defence.

37:28.440 --> 37:30.647
I just don't believe him
any more.

37:31.320 --> 37:33.800
I can't cover for Five Four
any longer.

37:37.120 --> 37:39.726
He convinced me to blame Rod,

37:41.800 --> 37:43.962
but I'm not sure
Rod could have killed Danny.

37:45.360 --> 37:47.931
He wasn't that son of man.

37:55.120 --> 37:56.770
I betrayed him.

38:02.160 --> 38:05.164
Constable, you have
my sincere condolences...

38:05.920 --> 38:07.922
...for the deaths
of your colleagues.

38:07.960 --> 38:10.691
However, we have a job to do,

38:10.720 --> 38:14.167
and that job requires us
to investigate thoroughly

38:14.200 --> 38:16.680
and impartially
the murder of one of our own.

38:16.720 --> 38:20.566
And whilst we appreciate
your cooperation here today,

38:20.600 --> 38:27.210
you have knowingly misled
this inquiry for weeks

38:27.240 --> 38:30.722
on matters of
the utmost gravity.

38:30.760 --> 38:34.924
Firstly, in respect of
the shooting dead of a suspect.

38:35.600 --> 38:40.367
Secondly, in respect of
the loss of life of an officer

38:40.400 --> 38:42.004
in the line of duty,

38:42.040 --> 38:44.520
the withholding of
crucial information,

38:44.560 --> 38:48.360
the blatant disregard from your
lawful duty as a police officer

38:48.400 --> 38:51.165
to comply with a criminal
investigation.

38:51.200 --> 38:54.921
Therefore I am submitting
to the Police Board

38:54.960 --> 38:56.849
that you be served with
a red notice,

38:56.880 --> 39:00.851
which is the termination of your
contract as a police officer,

39:00.880 --> 39:04.202
and moreover I will report
to the Crown Prosecutor

39:04.240 --> 39:06.607
regarding perverting
the course of justice

39:06.640 --> 39:08.529
and assisting an offender.

39:08.560 --> 39:10.483
You won't be charged
at this time.

39:10.520 --> 39:12.568
However, pending discussions,

39:12.600 --> 39:14.807
you may be charged
with these offences.

39:14.840 --> 39:19.050
But I thought if I cooperated
that you'd go easier on me.

39:20.120 --> 39:24.091
A suspension. A yellow notice.

39:24.120 --> 39:26.851
A fellow officer
has been killed.

39:28.200 --> 39:32.285
There is no more serious offence
that we investigate.

39:32.320 --> 39:35.290
Now, you may think I'm harsh,
Constable...

39:37.320 --> 39:39.368
...but I know
that this is justice.

39:50.040 --> 39:52.042
(Door opens)

39:52.080 --> 39:53.286
All rise.

40:04.680 --> 40:07.206
Foreman of the jury,
please stand.

40:08.360 --> 40:11.409
Have you reached a verdict
upon which you are all agreed'?

40:11.440 --> 40:13.283
No, we have not.

40:14.600 --> 40:16.887
In these circumstances,

40:16.920 --> 40:19.241
lam willing to accept
a majority verdict

40:19.280 --> 40:21.362
upon which
ten or more of you agree.

40:21.400 --> 40:23.050
Yes, My Lady.

40:24.440 --> 40:26.442
All rise.

40:44.960 --> 40:46.928
Pick. A or B'?

40:46.960 --> 40:48.485
A.

40:48.520 --> 40:50.966
The report from the second PM
on PC Kennedy.

40:55.560 --> 40:56.891
- (Knocking)
- Yeah.

40:57.760 --> 40:59.524
Boss, I thought
this shouldn't wait.

40:59.560 --> 41:01.562
Yeah. Come on.

41:07.600 --> 41:09.170
Something I should know about?

41:09.200 --> 41:11.441
Yeah. Why not bring
the whole office with you'?

41:11.480 --> 41:12.811
I'm sorry, sir.

41:12.840 --> 41:15.366
The pathologist revised
the findings on Kennedy's PM.

41:15.400 --> 41:18.165
You mean she's admitted they
screwed up on the first one'?

41:18.200 --> 41:21.283
The findings are subtle. There's
a superficial head injury.

41:21.320 --> 41:23.641
The bruising was hidden
at the back of the head,

41:23.680 --> 41:27.048
and minor defensive wounds on
the hands, again very subtle.

41:27.080 --> 41:30.163
No organic material recovered
from under the fingernails.

41:30.200 --> 41:33.124
- None of this is very strong.
- I went back over the forensics

41:33.160 --> 41:35.003
and foreign fibres were
on his clothes.

41:35.040 --> 41:36.405
Again, not strong.

41:36.440 --> 41:38.886
Same fibres were found in
Kennedy's nose and mouth

41:38.920 --> 41:41.241
- at the second PM.
- Right.

41:41.280 --> 41:42.930
Best guess,
someone smothered him

41:42.960 --> 41:44.883
then hanged him
while he was unconscious.

41:44.920 --> 41:47.161
Well, if Bains killed Danny,

41:47.200 --> 41:49.601
I'd lay you evens
he killed Kennedy as well.

41:49.640 --> 41:51.642
Maneet just showed me this.

41:51.680 --> 41:55.048
Traffic camera vid caps from the
night of Rod Kennedy's death.

41:55.080 --> 41:58.607
This camera is half a mile
from the industrial estate.

41:58.640 --> 42:02.247
This registration matches
a vehicle registered to...

42:03.120 --> 42:05.361
...Harinderpal Bains.

42:06.920 --> 42:10.447
We've definitely gone over
the threshold for PC Hari Bains.

42:10.480 --> 42:13.051
- Bring him in, Steve.
- Good call, gaffer.

42:17.160 --> 42:19.766
What happened with the PM'?
Weren't you organising it'?

42:19.800 --> 42:21.131
Yeah, listen, mate.

42:21.160 --> 42:23.640
I sent the email but I only just
saw this morning

42:23.680 --> 42:25.921
it bounced back from
the pathologist's office.

42:25.960 --> 42:29.043
- All right.
- Steve. Life-saver.

42:32.600 --> 42:33.806
(Phone rings)

42:35.600 --> 42:39.047
Maneet, get me an update on Hari
Bains's whereabouts. Urgent.

42:41.400 --> 42:43.164
- Telecoms.
- I'll get hold of Kate,

42:43.200 --> 42:44.486
see if she's on his tail.

42:44.520 --> 42:47.490
We need an urgent triangulation
on a suspects mobile phone.

42:47.520 --> 42:52.845
Telephone number
07591152689.

42:58.880 --> 43:00.609
- (Phone rings)
- Yeah.

43:00.640 --> 43:02.130
He's at or near home.

43:02.160 --> 43:04.686
Could have concealed firearms.
Organise armed back-up.

43:04.720 --> 43:07.724
Telecoms triangulation places
Hari Bains at his home address.

43:07.760 --> 43:10.366
We understand that his wife
and one child

43:10.400 --> 43:12.289
reside at this same address.

43:12.320 --> 43:15.130
- What?
- PC Francis is in his squad.

43:15.160 --> 43:16.730
She shouldn't be in here.

43:17.880 --> 43:21.726
Correct. Thank you. Francis.

43:24.720 --> 43:26.802
Sir.

43:35.480 --> 43:37.323
(Phone rings)

43:37.360 --> 43:39.840
- DI Cottan.
- I've been bumped off the op.

43:39.880 --> 43:41.609
Too close to Bains.

43:41.640 --> 43:43.529
I need to be in on this.
Can you make a call'?

43:43.560 --> 43:46.211
No. This is too dangerous.
I want you out of it.

43:46.240 --> 43:48.481
- For Christ's sake, Dot!
- Sorry, Kate.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.446
You set aside that this is
one of our own.

43:53.480 --> 43:55.209
Hari Bains is potentially armed

43:55.240 --> 43:57.481
and is considered to be
extremely dangerous.

43:57.520 --> 43:59.522
(Alarms ringing)

44:03.400 --> 44:04.765
Let's get this done.

44:05.080 --> 44:07.082
(Sirens wailing)

44:19.480 --> 44:22.689
<i>- Hello'?
- You were right about the PM.</i>

44:22.720 --> 44:25.326
Rod Kennedy. He was murdered.

44:25.360 --> 44:27.362
(Phone rings)

44:30.720 --> 44:31.881
Hello'?

44:31.920 --> 44:34.241
<i>You're being fitted up
for murdering Kennedy.</i>

44:34.280 --> 44:36.009
No. He was fine when I left him.

44:36.040 --> 44:38.281
<i>Do you hear how guilty
you sound already?</i>

44:38.320 --> 44:41.051
- I... I <i>don't know</i> what <i>to do.</i>
- <i>Well, I do this fora living.</i>

44:41.080 --> 44:44.482
(Cockney accent) lf you want
a way out, you'll listen to me.

45:03.840 --> 45:05.649
- Where's your DI'?
- On his way.

45:05.680 --> 45:07.205
Then I'm the ranking officer.

45:07.240 --> 45:09.129
We need Bains alive
for information.

45:09.160 --> 45:12.642
Armed police! Come out with
your hands above your head!

45:12.680 --> 45:14.603
I'm coming out!

45:15.960 --> 45:18.440
- Where's Hari'?
- He went into the garage.

45:18.480 --> 45:20.164
- Open it.
- The keys are on the side.

45:20.200 --> 45:22.931
- Get her out of here.
- Hari! It's McAndrew.

45:24.600 --> 45:26.568
- We're opening the garage door.
- (Bleep)

45:28.600 --> 45:29.761
It's jammed.

45:30.640 --> 45:32.051
Wait!

45:39.720 --> 45:41.165
Clear.

45:43.040 --> 45:45.042
Don't touch the phone.

45:55.120 --> 45:56.246
(Phone rings)

45:57.000 --> 45:59.367
- Arnott.
COTTAN: I've got eyes on Bains.

45:59.400 --> 46:02.483
<i>He's entered the industrial unit
where Kennedy's body was found.</i>

46:02.520 --> 46:05.126
He's probably armed. Don't
move in till I bring back-up.

46:05.160 --> 46:06.844
<i>I'm not daft.
I'll stay out of it.</i>

46:06.880 --> 46:08.086
On our way. Come here.

46:08.120 --> 46:11.169
Secure that phone. I've got obs
on Bains. Follow me.

46:16.040 --> 46:19.522
- (Siren wails)
- Kate, we've got obs on Bains.

46:19.560 --> 46:22.450
I'm en route to the industrial
unit where Kennedy was found.

46:22.480 --> 46:24.244
Cheers, Steve. I'm on my way.

47:10.240 --> 47:14.643
Seriously?
Of all the places to run, mate!

47:14.680 --> 47:16.205
Where are you going now'?

47:21.560 --> 47:23.562
What are you doing here'?

47:23.600 --> 47:26.251
I'm just minding
my own business,

47:26.280 --> 47:28.601
re-examining an old crime scene.

47:29.840 --> 47:32.764
Are you expecting someone else'?

47:32.800 --> 47:34.211
Who?

47:34.760 --> 47:37.127
I don't know
what you're on about, mate.

47:37.160 --> 47:39.242
Well, have it your own way.

47:39.280 --> 47:42.648
I was giving you a chance
before the circus arrives.

47:50.120 --> 47:52.009
A chance of what'?

47:58.240 --> 48:02.723
The way I see it, it's your word
against Jackie Brickford's.

48:03.520 --> 48:06.683
If you're seen to be cooperating
with the inquiry,

48:06.720 --> 48:10.008
then it doesn't take a genius to
figure out who they'll believe.

48:10.680 --> 48:13.729
Listen, bud, I don't trust you
as far as I can throw you.

48:14.520 --> 48:16.807
This is where
your mate Rod died.

48:17.440 --> 48:19.647
We've just had
the postmortem report in.

48:20.440 --> 48:24.650
He was murdered. You see,
that's what I'm doing here.

48:25.240 --> 48:28.483
You'?
It's not very clever, is it...

48:29.800 --> 48:31.928
...returning to the scene
of the crime'?

48:31.960 --> 48:34.122
I had nothing to do with that.

48:34.160 --> 48:36.401
I believe you, mate. I do.

48:37.160 --> 48:40.084
And, frankly,
between the two of us,

48:40.120 --> 48:42.122
the forensics aren't
that strong.

48:43.400 --> 48:46.131
But will Hastings? Hm'?

48:46.160 --> 48:47.491
Will the CPS'?

48:50.240 --> 48:53.244
This is that chance
I was talking about.

48:55.400 --> 48:58.609
Now, starting with
Danny Waldron, before he died,

48:58.640 --> 49:01.371
did he ever confide to you
about these two pervs he killed?

49:02.280 --> 49:04.681
- No, he never said owt.
- You think carefully!

49:04.720 --> 49:07.405
Ronan Murphy and Linus Murphy
were the blokes he killed.

49:07.440 --> 49:11.570
Did he ever mention any other
names? Politicians? Coppers?

49:11.600 --> 49:13.011
- No.
- Think!

49:13.720 --> 49:15.688
Tommy Hunter and Lindsay Denton?

49:15.720 --> 49:18.200
What would Danny have to say
about them'?

49:21.480 --> 49:23.448
All right.

49:23.480 --> 49:25.642
So who are you here to meet'?

49:25.680 --> 49:28.445
I don't know.
I've never met him.

49:29.680 --> 49:32.286
I don't know anything about him.

49:33.120 --> 49:35.361
- Nothing'?
- No, nothing.

49:35.400 --> 49:37.402
Have it your own way.

49:37.440 --> 49:39.010
Look, you don't understand.

49:39.040 --> 49:40.883
What don't I understand?

49:40.920 --> 49:44.003
- Man, I'm just small fry.
- Steady!

49:44.040 --> 49:47.487
It's just my phone.
Look, it's unregistered.

49:47.520 --> 49:49.170
They can't trace it.

49:50.240 --> 49:52.242
I'll call him for you now, yeah?

49:53.680 --> 49:55.444
Yeah.

50:02.800 --> 50:04.643
(Bleep)

50:04.680 --> 50:07.081
<i>The number you have called
is not recognised.</i>

50:07.120 --> 50:08.724
<i>Please check the number.</i>

50:08.760 --> 50:10.888
<i>The number you have called
is not recognised.</i>

50:10.920 --> 50:12.922
<i>Please check the number.</i>

50:13.520 --> 50:16.524
- The number you have called...
- (Ends call)

50:17.600 --> 50:19.523
There is no "bloke"!

50:20.640 --> 50:24.645
It's all you.
You killed Danny Waldron.

50:24.680 --> 50:26.603
You persuaded your mates
to lie about it.

50:26.640 --> 50:28.961
When Kennedy wanted
to come clean, you killed him!

50:29.000 --> 50:31.241
No. None of that's true.

50:32.720 --> 50:34.165
(Siren approaching)

50:34.200 --> 50:36.202
I never killed Rod.

51:03.040 --> 51:05.611
- Go!
- Armed police!

51:05.640 --> 51:08.211
- AC-12, don't shoot!
- Stay on the ground!

51:08.240 --> 51:10.641
- Hands behind your head!
- Cuff him.

51:11.360 --> 51:13.044
- You OK, Dot'?
- Yeah.

51:19.280 --> 51:21.851
I'm arresting you fer the murder
of Roderick Kennedy.

51:21.880 --> 51:23.120
You do not have to say anything,

51:23.160 --> 51:24.685
but it may harm your defence
if you fail to mention,

51:24.720 --> 51:26.882
when questioned, something
you later rely on in court

51:26.920 --> 51:29.685
Anything you do say
may be used in evidence.

51:29.720 --> 51:30.960
Key.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.287
What the hell are you
doing here, Francis?

51:33.320 --> 51:35.607
DC Fleming, ma'am. AC-12.

51:35.640 --> 51:38.371
- What happened'?
- Go take a look.

51:59.200 --> 52:01.680
COTTAN: When I got here,
Bains jumped me.

52:01.720 --> 52:05.088
He was gonna string me up the
same way he did Rod Kennedy.

52:05.120 --> 52:06.531
I should have had back-up.

52:06.560 --> 52:08.881
I just didn't want him
to get away, you know.

52:08.920 --> 52:12.163
Nobody will question your
judgment. You did a grand job.

52:12.200 --> 52:14.680
Get to the hospital
and get yourself a check-up.

52:14.720 --> 52:16.882
- Off you go.
- Cheers, guv.

52:17.520 --> 52:20.410
Inspector, we're going to take
this man into our custody,

52:20.440 --> 52:23.205
but I'd like you to give us one
of your crews to ride shotgun.

52:23.240 --> 52:25.242
Yes, sir.

52:26.440 --> 52:28.522
You're lucky AC-12
got to you first.

52:29.880 --> 52:33.202
My team, we're following.
The rest, back to the station.

52:37.240 --> 52:39.720
Have you anything to say'?

52:42.200 --> 52:44.089
Take him away.

52:44.120 --> 52:45.645
Steve.

52:48.720 --> 52:50.609
- You OK, Dot'?
- Yeah, I'll live.

53:05.720 --> 53:07.722
(Siren wails)

53:10.480 --> 53:12.482
(Chatter)

53:23.320 --> 53:26.403
The jury's coming back. You're
free to come in if you want.

53:26.440 --> 53:28.204
I'll wait here.

53:39.240 --> 53:40.571
(Door opens)

53:54.120 --> 53:55.690
Will the defendant please stand?

53:59.080 --> 54:01.765
Will the foreman of the jury
please stand?

54:06.480 --> 54:08.209
An 18-1 search
of Hari Bains's home

54:08.240 --> 54:10.288
uncovered a cache
of mobile phones.

54:10.320 --> 54:12.846
All of the unregistered
pay-as-you-go variety.

54:12.880 --> 54:16.407
Finding these phones allowed us
to examine their call history.

54:16.440 --> 54:19.922
Hari Bains received a call the
night before going to McAndrew

54:19.960 --> 54:21.769
to volunteer to stay
on Danny's squad.

54:21.800 --> 54:23.882
Who was the call from'?

54:23.920 --> 54:27.288
Unfortunately it was also an
unregistered pay-as-you-go phone

54:27.320 --> 54:29.482
and said phone's
no longer in history.

54:29.520 --> 54:31.488
Same MO as the recent text
Bains received,

54:31.520 --> 54:33.568
telling him to sit tight.

54:33.600 --> 54:36.729
Three days later there's another
call from the same number.

54:36.760 --> 54:39.331
That was the night before Bains
murdered Danny Waldron.

54:39.360 --> 54:41.089
Do you think they're connected?

54:41.120 --> 54:44.602
If they are, it means somebody's
been pulling the strings

54:44.640 --> 54:46.210
and ordered Danny's murder.

54:46.240 --> 54:48.846
- Well done, Dot!
- Nice one, guv!

54:50.600 --> 54:52.364
Good job!

54:52.400 --> 54:54.767
- Welcome back, Dot!
- Thanks, gaffer.

54:54.800 --> 54:56.006
Great work, sir.

54:56.040 --> 54:58.168
<i>On the charge of
conspiracy to murder,</i>

54:58.200 --> 55:01.204
have you reached a verdict upon
which at least ten of you agree?

55:01.240 --> 55:03.288
- We have.
- What is your verdict?

55:04.040 --> 55:06.361
Not guilty.

55:06.400 --> 55:09.051
On the charge of perverting
the course of justice,

55:09.080 --> 55:11.686
have you reached a verdict upon
which at least ten agree?

55:11.720 --> 55:14.246
- We have.
- What is your verdict?

55:15.080 --> 55:16.809
Guilty.

55:17.760 --> 55:20.889
Members of the jury, thank you
for your time and efforts

55:20.920 --> 55:22.649
in this complex case.

55:24.440 --> 55:26.442
You are now dismissed.

55:31.200 --> 55:32.964
I'm putting you in
for a commendation.

55:33.000 --> 55:36.004
- Sir, I don't deserve that.
- Listen to this fella!

55:36.040 --> 55:37.690
Single-handedly brings in an APO

55:37.720 --> 55:40.200
who killed two Coppers
in cold blood,

55:40.240 --> 55:42.481
and for all he knew,
they were armed to the teeth.

55:42.520 --> 55:44.409
I'll give you
"Don't deserve it"!

55:44.440 --> 55:46.090
Thank you, sir.

55:47.040 --> 55:48.644
- Nice one, guv.
- Cheers, Clive.

55:48.680 --> 55:50.808
<i>Lindsay Denton,</i>

55:50.840 --> 55:53.446
<i>for the offence of perverting
the course of justice,</i>

55:53.480 --> 55:57.769
I impose a sentence of
38 months' imprisonment.

55:59.200 --> 56:00.690
Since you have already served

56:00.720 --> 56:02.802
the custodial term
of that sentence,

56:02.840 --> 56:06.003
your immediate release
on licence will follow.

56:06.040 --> 56:07.883
You are now free to go.

56:17.000 --> 56:18.331
All rise.

56:26.560 --> 56:28.562
(Mouths)

56:41.800 --> 56:44.326
I don't believe it.
They've let her out on licence.

56:46.200 --> 56:48.407
WOMAN: Lindsay! Lindsay!
- (Press Glamour)

56:50.720 --> 56:53.963
Ladies and gentlemen, I would
like to make a brief statement

56:54.000 --> 56:56.082
on behalf of my client.

56:56.120 --> 57:00.011
My client would like to thank
the men and women of the jury

57:00.040 --> 57:02.566
who were faced with
a complex case...

57:02.600 --> 57:06.082
585 days,
and on every single one

57:06.120 --> 57:08.805
I thought about what I'd do
when this moment finally came.

57:14.000 --> 57:15.684
I forgive you.

57:15.720 --> 57:21.648
...the tragic and shocking events
of the 5th September, 2013.

57:21.680 --> 57:24.650
- Who framed you?
- Who's the real guilty party?

57:24.680 --> 57:28.162
- I'd like to thank the jury.
- Were you set up'?

57:28.200 --> 57:29.725
Do you think you were framed'?

57:29.760 --> 57:31.524
I'd just like
to get on with my life.

57:31.560 --> 57:33.562
(Barrage of questions)

57:38.880 --> 57:40.803
<i>W: Lindsay,
what are you gonna do next?</i>

57:41.840 --> 57:43.365
<i>Who set you up?</i>

57:46.040 --> 57:48.850
<i>I'd like to thank the jury
