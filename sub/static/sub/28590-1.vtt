WEBVTT

00:32.156 --> 00:35.201
So, I looked at a bunch of houses,
and I think I've found the best one.

00:35.285 --> 00:37.245
It's perfect. I'm gonna send you the link.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.122
And then,
we should just go ahead and get it

00:39.205 --> 00:40.373
'cause it's the best one.

00:40.457 --> 00:42.208
<i>Abby, the house looks amazing,</i>

00:42.292 --> 00:43.960
and the thought of a trip is exciting,

00:44.044 --> 00:47.130
but turning 50 is so not a big deal to me.

00:47.672 --> 00:50.467
I had a patient this week
who is in knots about turning 40.

00:50.759 --> 00:53.803
The feedback I offered her,
as corny as it sounds, is:

00:53.887 --> 00:55.889
"Age is truly just a number."

00:56.014 --> 00:58.266
I mean,
you're only as old as you feel, right?

00:58.349 --> 00:59.601
Why stress about it?

01:00.477 --> 01:01.394
Fuck, that's hot!

01:01.644 --> 01:02.771
I always love Hawaii.

01:02.854 --> 01:05.230
You know what?
I catered Jack Johnson's birthday party,

01:05.315 --> 01:06.691
and he said I could use
his beach house there.

01:06.775 --> 01:08.777
Okay, here are my top picks: Napa...

01:09.527 --> 01:11.404
a resort in Arizona, or Napa.

01:11.488 --> 01:13.865
Well, all I can say
is thank God you're planning this,

01:13.948 --> 01:17.368
'cause you know Brian is not
gonna do shit for her 50th.

01:17.452 --> 01:19.829
You know Brian would just take her
to Macaroni Grill,

01:19.913 --> 01:22.999
and then she'd have to drive home
because he had too much to drink.

01:23.124 --> 01:24.209
Fucking Brian.

01:24.501 --> 01:26.461
Oh, my God, this trip sounds so fun.

01:26.544 --> 01:28.213
And it's so great
everyone can get together.

01:28.463 --> 01:30.465
-You're coming, right?
-No.

01:30.799 --> 01:33.384
Mama needs to rock out with her cock out.

01:33.843 --> 01:37.222
Also, Mama needs to stop referring
to herself in the third person.

01:37.514 --> 01:39.516
And maybe ease up on the cock drops.

01:39.599 --> 01:42.102
I just want this to feel
like a regular vacation.

01:42.185 --> 01:44.521
You know, like... just sit around, talk

01:44.604 --> 01:46.981
and drink wine and laugh
and... wear muumuus...

01:47.065 --> 01:49.943
And just somewhere in there,
I'll just kind of slide into 50.

01:50.026 --> 01:52.195
You know,
I just want it to be super chill,

01:52.278 --> 01:53.696
-no big deal--
-Die!

01:54.322 --> 01:56.157
Brian, could you turn that down?

01:56.241 --> 01:59.202
No, I'm sorry, Rebecca,
but it is officially a big deal.

01:59.285 --> 02:01.371
It's your half-centennial.

02:01.454 --> 02:03.665
I'm not gonna let this go by
without doing something big.

02:03.748 --> 02:06.501
Okay... I'm gonna cut my bangs.

02:06.584 --> 02:09.586
I really wanna make this work.
Honestly, I'm just so grateful

02:09.670 --> 02:12.048
that you guys still want me to come
after I bailed on the last one.

02:12.340 --> 02:16.136
God, it's just, like, the flying
and that random house, you know?

02:16.219 --> 02:17.929
It just, like, gives me anxiety.

02:18.221 --> 02:20.682
Other people's bathrooms... Oh, God!

02:21.516 --> 02:22.600
Weird bedspreads...

02:22.684 --> 02:24.727
You... do still want me to come, right?

02:25.019 --> 02:27.522
Wall-to-wall carpeting, the remote...

02:28.273 --> 02:30.275
You know what?
I wish I'd never seen that <i>Dateline</i>

02:30.358 --> 02:32.402
with the blacklight
where they showed where the semen was.

02:32.652 --> 02:35.905
Is a flower in the hair too much
for solo dining?

02:36.156 --> 02:38.241
I need to get out
and take my new knees for a spin.

02:38.825 --> 02:41.286
Val, yes, work those new knees!

02:41.369 --> 02:43.621
-Out!
-<i>I just wanna meet a nice lady</i>

02:43.705 --> 02:47.167
and I wanna make out for a while
and then spoon a little bit...

02:47.917 --> 02:51.713
And then that spooning can turn
into a real spirited sixty-nining.

02:51.796 --> 02:54.090
Have you ever tried a position
called the 1,000?

02:54.174 --> 02:55.216
It's a sexy one.

02:55.550 --> 02:57.802
It's when 1,000 kids are in your bed,

02:57.886 --> 03:01.055
and the only touch you feel
is a tiny sweaty foot to the back.

03:01.139 --> 03:04.100
Speaking of sexy,
I share my bed with a CPAP machine.

03:04.601 --> 03:05.560
Things we say now.

03:06.227 --> 03:09.898
I'm in H&M trying on some party clothes.

03:10.023 --> 03:13.026
I can't wait to see you guys
and pinch all your butts...

03:13.109 --> 03:13.985
with consent.

03:14.110 --> 03:14.986
<i>See you soon!</i>

03:15.403 --> 03:17.739
And, well, you know,
we'll figure out money when we get there.

03:18.156 --> 03:19.657
Keep it in your pants till I see you.

03:19.866 --> 03:21.451
Bye, I love you!

03:21.576 --> 03:23.077
-What?
-No, I'm on the phone.

03:23.161 --> 03:24.537
Bye, and remember,
don't make this a big deal.

03:24.621 --> 03:27.415
-I just told my driver that I loved him.
-Somebody hang up.

03:27.498 --> 03:30.043
All right, love you, guys, too. Bye!

03:30.126 --> 03:31.461
Still not sure I'm coming.

04:08.539 --> 04:09.374
Okay.

04:10.500 --> 04:11.417
Here we are.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.253
I hope it's perfect.

04:13.962 --> 04:17.257
I don't know,
it had very good reviews online.

04:17.714 --> 04:21.302
And let me tell you something,
I had to wade through a lot of shitboxes.

04:21.427 --> 04:23.054
But this one is supposed to be good.

04:23.137 --> 04:24.806
And it's supposed to have a pool.

04:24.889 --> 04:26.015
Does anybody see a pool?

04:26.099 --> 04:29.102
Oh, it is just stunning!
It's just so perfect.

04:29.227 --> 04:32.689
-Just release all that worry.
-Or swallow it?

04:33.648 --> 04:35.108
Okay, shall we?

04:35.525 --> 04:36.693
Edible flowers!

04:37.277 --> 04:38.111
I see that.

04:38.194 --> 04:40.613
-Oh, my God.
-How do you know they're edible?

04:40.822 --> 04:42.073
What? These are edible.

04:42.156 --> 04:44.617
You wanna be the protector
and the caretaker and everything,

04:44.701 --> 04:46.911
but... just let her deal with it.

04:46.995 --> 04:50.456
-What the hell is she doing?
-Cannot let a stranger stay a stranger.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.875
...you wanna take care of them,
and you wanna be the hero,

04:52.959 --> 04:54.877
but sometimes you gotta back off,

04:54.961 --> 04:56.796
let someone else in the family do it,
you know?

04:56.879 --> 04:58.965
She's probably gonna invite him
to join us on the trip.

04:59.048 --> 05:01.676
-Not, that that would be a bad--
-No, yeah, it would.

05:01.759 --> 05:03.261
You take care of yourself.

05:04.554 --> 05:07.890
And I really hope that your sister
is able to move your mom's grave.

05:07.974 --> 05:10.310
And I'm gonna try the manicotti recipe.
Thanks.

05:11.352 --> 05:12.186
Ready?

05:12.395 --> 05:14.439
-To Rebecca!
-To Rebecca!

05:15.064 --> 05:15.940
All right!

05:16.024 --> 05:17.567
Thank you so much

05:17.734 --> 05:18.651
for turning 50

05:19.152 --> 05:21.112
-and bringing us all together.
-Yeah.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.196
And thank you, guys.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.157
I know you all had to move mountains
to make this happen.

05:24.240 --> 05:27.243
-Especially you, Catherine.
-You know, life's a juggle, so...

05:27.535 --> 05:28.745
I really appreciate it.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.371
Rebecca really appreciates it.

05:31.414 --> 05:34.751
Why am I speaking for Rebecca?
This is a terrible toast. I'm sorry.

05:35.001 --> 05:37.587
I hope you guys like the house.
Let's get drunk. Happy birthday.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.964
-Happy birthday!
-Cheers to us!

05:40.465 --> 05:43.217
If I just may offer
a little bit of feedback,

05:43.301 --> 05:46.763
I just want this to be a fun weekend
for all of us, right? Not just about me.

05:47.513 --> 05:49.932
God, when was the last time
we were all together?

05:51.100 --> 05:52.685
It was at Abby's wedding.

05:52.769 --> 05:53.770
-What? No.
-Maybe.

05:53.853 --> 05:56.606
You should have come to my divorce party.
There was a really great band.

05:56.689 --> 05:58.149
-It wasn't that long ago.
-Jesus.

05:58.232 --> 05:59.692
Nice one, kid.

06:00.151 --> 06:01.235
Guys...

06:01.652 --> 06:04.822
time goes by so fast, I'm telling you.

06:04.906 --> 06:07.283
I have needed this... so much.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.327
-You guys have been on my mind--
-Adrian, comma,

06:09.410 --> 06:12.288
please resend the link to <i>Top Chef,</i>
period.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.165
Can't open, period.

06:14.248 --> 06:15.333
New paragraph.

06:15.416 --> 06:18.294
Also, comma, please ask producers

06:18.544 --> 06:22.006
how this show will be different,
question mark, dot, dot, dot.

06:22.924 --> 06:23.883
I'm so sorry.

06:23.966 --> 06:25.885
I have so much going on
with work right now.

06:25.968 --> 06:26.844
I'm gonna unplug.

06:27.345 --> 06:28.346
Be present, right.

06:30.306 --> 06:31.140
Send.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.726
Anyway, I made itineraries.

06:33.810 --> 06:34.894
-What?
-I know.

06:34.977 --> 06:36.396
And you don't have to read 'em now.

06:36.479 --> 06:38.856
Just, you know, take your time,
but sort of like a...

06:39.315 --> 06:43.653
loosey-goosey, you know,
sort of, like, scheduley thing.

06:43.778 --> 06:46.406
Just sort of an overview
of everything we're gonna do

06:46.489 --> 06:47.657
minute by minute on the trip.

06:48.032 --> 06:50.952
-No worries, just take a look at it.
-This is so awesome.

06:51.035 --> 06:53.746
-No presh.
-When did you have time to make those?

06:53.830 --> 06:56.082
Well, I've been working a lot less lately.

06:56.332 --> 06:57.708
-Yeah, right.
-Well, good for you.

06:57.792 --> 06:58.626
Yeah.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.962
We look so young.

07:01.921 --> 07:02.880
God.

07:10.972 --> 07:11.806
Wow.

07:18.604 --> 07:19.689
Let's take a group picture.

07:19.772 --> 07:21.399
-Yes.
-Yeah!

07:21.482 --> 07:23.234
-Yes!
-We need a new pic.

07:23.860 --> 07:26.195
-It's a night of a thousand selfies.
-Yeah.

07:26.904 --> 07:28.489
-Can you go higher?
-Yeah, go higher.

07:28.573 --> 07:30.408
-Try to go higher.
-All right, everybody look down,

07:30.491 --> 07:32.493
and then on the count of three,
look up. Fresh faces.

07:32.577 --> 07:33.411
Fresh face.

07:33.786 --> 07:35.496
-One, two, three.
-One...

07:38.958 --> 07:39.792
That's nice.

07:39.917 --> 07:40.751
Wait.

07:40.918 --> 07:41.752
What the...

07:42.336 --> 07:43.296
Is that a ghost?

07:43.504 --> 07:44.922
Oh, my God, it <i>is </i> a ghost.

07:45.006 --> 07:48.217
It's the ghost of Amelia Earhart,
and she's holding a small baby.

07:48.676 --> 07:50.595
-What are you guys doing in my house?
-Oh, my God.

07:50.678 --> 07:51.637
Nah, I'm just goofing.

07:52.138 --> 07:54.140
I'm Tammy, I own the place.

07:54.390 --> 07:56.476
Brought you guys a cord of fresh pinyon,

07:56.559 --> 07:57.977
get you started on a fire.

07:59.187 --> 08:00.021
Thank you.

08:00.646 --> 08:01.689
Guys, this is Tammy.

08:01.772 --> 08:03.232
She's the owner of the place.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.902
I'm Abby.
I'm the one that's been emailing you.

08:05.985 --> 08:06.986
A lot of emails.

08:07.403 --> 08:08.237
Yeah.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.363
So...

08:09.947 --> 08:12.241
which one of you guys
is the blushing bride?

08:12.325 --> 08:14.911
Second time around I'm thinking, maybe?
Maybe third?

08:14.994 --> 08:17.830
Oh, no. We're celebrating
Rebecca's birthday. It's her...

08:17.914 --> 08:19.415
50th, the big five-oh.

08:19.957 --> 08:21.834
Celebrating-with-the-girls weekend, huh?

08:21.918 --> 08:24.712
We're just here for a vacation.
The birthday's not a big deal.

08:24.795 --> 08:26.339
So, what am I looking at here?

08:26.589 --> 08:29.258
High school tennis team,
old dance crew, or...

08:29.592 --> 08:31.886
y'all magically fit
in the same pair of pants?

08:32.220 --> 08:33.471
What brings us together?

08:33.554 --> 08:35.472
Oh, well, we all met in Chicago

08:35.556 --> 08:37.683
waitressing at a pizza place
called Antonio's,

08:37.767 --> 08:40.436
and we just... It was meant to be.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.313
Chi-Town? Yeah,
I've been to that place, yeah.

08:43.438 --> 08:45.107
Well, we all came up there together
in the '90s.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.025
Like, kind of our crew.

08:46.484 --> 08:49.987
Actually, Catherine here started her own
pizza chain called Cutie Pies.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.489
Holy shit, that's you?

08:51.739 --> 08:53.241
Well, I've never been to the restaurant,

08:53.324 --> 08:55.493
but I do love those frozen pizzas
for one that you do.

08:55.576 --> 08:56.410
Thank you.

08:56.494 --> 08:58.871
'Cause, you know,
if I prep a full-sized pizza, guess what?

08:58.955 --> 09:00.957
I'm gonna end up eating a full-size pizza.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.709
So, you know,
you prevent a lot of sadness.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.295
So, do you guys want to see the house or--

09:06.379 --> 09:07.547
-Yes.
-All right.

09:08.005 --> 09:09.423
Let's stop dicking around.

09:09.507 --> 09:13.177
You got the pool and the hot tub here
if you wanna soak...

09:13.427 --> 09:14.804
or toke.

09:15.012 --> 09:18.724
We are very discreet, so just...
do whatever the heck you need to do

09:18.808 --> 09:20.601
-to get through this weekend.
-Okay.

09:21.602 --> 09:23.521
So, Tammy,
how long have you owned the property?

09:23.854 --> 09:24.981
-A few years.
-Yeah?

09:25.064 --> 09:26.983
After my husband died, I sold our company.

09:27.066 --> 09:28.776
We made edible organic soaps.

09:29.193 --> 09:31.612
Got bought out by Unilever. Pretty sweet.

09:31.904 --> 09:33.864
Sorry your husband died. That's sad.

09:33.990 --> 09:37.076
Yeah, he died of a heart attack at 49.

09:37.451 --> 09:38.786
-That's so young.
-That's terrible.

09:39.203 --> 09:41.789
You think?
It was pretty inevitable, though.

09:42.123 --> 09:43.457
We were doing so much blow.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.918
This will come in real handy.

09:46.002 --> 09:50.381
The little Zen area,
when you need that total soul escape.

09:50.881 --> 09:54.343
It's real quiet. It's perfect
for when that roomie situation devolves.

09:54.427 --> 09:57.096
You can just come out here
and watch the hummingbirds,

09:57.179 --> 10:00.558
meditate,
enjoy this beautiful Buddha statue...

10:00.766 --> 10:03.644
Now, this water feature over here,
steer clear, please.

10:03.728 --> 10:06.856
Okay, you wanna know how much money
I poured into this son of a bitch?

10:06.939 --> 10:11.193
Seven grand. And before you suggest it,
no, I cannot just turn it off.

10:11.319 --> 10:13.404
If I do, none of the toilets will work.

10:13.613 --> 10:14.447
Which is ironic

10:14.530 --> 10:16.991
because it is basically a toilet
for birds...

10:17.074 --> 10:18.367
and me that one time.

10:19.243 --> 10:21.037
This is the firepit.

10:21.621 --> 10:22.997
Light that sucker up,

10:23.873 --> 10:25.583
stare into the flames and contemplate...

10:26.042 --> 10:28.961
why in the hell you all came up here
in the first place.

10:29.962 --> 10:31.339
Also, we have s'mores.

10:32.173 --> 10:34.759
Hey, Tammy, I'm just having a hard time
getting on the Wi-Fi.

10:34.842 --> 10:36.886
I just have to send
a quick e-mail for work.

10:36.969 --> 10:38.888
Okay, yeah,
this is gonna be a rough weekend

10:38.971 --> 10:40.598
if you have to do work stuff.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.767
The Wi-Fi here is very slow.

10:43.392 --> 10:45.978
So, you're just gonna have to talk
to each other.

10:46.062 --> 10:48.397
-Oh, good.
-While drinking a ton of wine.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.107
What could possibly go wrong?

10:50.941 --> 10:52.943
Just remember, guys, whatever gets said,

10:53.402 --> 10:55.946
it's probably
what the person has always felt,

10:56.197 --> 10:57.823
and the alcohol just let it out.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.828
You wanna see the view?
It's right through this gate.

11:06.707 --> 11:10.211
Holy triple fucks, this is heaven!

11:10.294 --> 11:12.129
Yeah, well, I didn't work my ass off

11:12.213 --> 11:14.507
to buy a house
on some shitscape property.

11:14.590 --> 11:15.675
-Wow.
-Yeah, that's fake.

11:15.758 --> 11:17.468
There's no way that's real.
It's too pretty.

11:17.968 --> 11:20.513
We should sleep out here one night,
under the stars.

11:20.596 --> 11:22.431
-Yeah.
-You know, like a camping slumber party.

11:22.515 --> 11:23.849
-Wouldn't that be fun?
-Yes!

11:23.933 --> 11:25.685
Oh, God. Yeah, I don't wanna do that.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.478
I don't know if I want to, either.

11:27.561 --> 11:29.689
I have no place
to plug in my CPAP machine.

11:29.814 --> 11:30.856
Things we say now.

11:32.942 --> 11:34.485
What's everybody laughing at?

11:35.027 --> 11:38.155
Oh, it's just like our, you know,
"That's what she said."

11:38.322 --> 11:40.116
-You know, "Things we say now."
-Right.

11:40.199 --> 11:41.075
So, like...

11:41.534 --> 11:43.327
"I gotta go tend my bees."

11:43.411 --> 11:44.745
Things we say now.

11:46.247 --> 11:47.081
I guess.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.792
Well, I say it,
'cause I got a bee farm, so...

11:50.376 --> 11:51.210
You make honey?

11:51.544 --> 11:52.878
No, I don't make honey.

11:53.337 --> 11:54.338
I get stung a lot.

11:54.463 --> 11:56.799
But you develop an immunity to it.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.300
And almost a pleasure.

11:59.552 --> 12:02.722
Well, you all obviously have
an entire haunted forest

12:02.805 --> 12:06.183
of toxic jibber-jabber
to get through, so I'm gonna skedaddle.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.310
-Okay, thank you.
-I have a question about the cleaning fee,

12:08.394 --> 12:09.270
when you get a chance.

12:09.353 --> 12:10.312
-Love it.
-See you.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.273
-What else do bees do?
-All right.

12:12.690 --> 12:15.359
Well, guys, you know what?
Even if we don't sleep out here,

12:15.443 --> 12:18.696
I love Naomi's idea of just, like,
hanging out and drinking wine.

12:19.029 --> 12:20.948
Just talking, connecting...

12:21.031 --> 12:22.032
-Yes, totally.
-Love it.

12:22.116 --> 12:25.077
We are gonna do all of that.
All of that is baked into the itinerary.

12:25.161 --> 12:27.538
We're gonna lay around,
we're gonna drink wine,

12:27.621 --> 12:29.290
but first on the docket:

12:29.874 --> 12:31.876
"Unpack and unwind." For 20 minutes.

12:32.668 --> 12:33.836
I'm setting a timer.

12:34.378 --> 12:35.629
Psych. But, no. But...

12:35.713 --> 12:36.714
I am...

12:36.797 --> 12:38.340
Just take 20 minutes

12:38.424 --> 12:40.593
'cause we have dinner reservations
at 7:15.

12:40.718 --> 12:44.138
My God, she actually said,
"toxic jibber-jabber."

12:44.221 --> 12:45.097
Yes, she did.

12:45.181 --> 12:48.184
God, and what about those bees?
What, does she keep them as pets?

12:48.267 --> 12:49.393
I gotta say something.

12:49.477 --> 12:51.187
I actually really resent it when people,

12:51.270 --> 12:54.106
especially other women,
automatically assume,

12:54.190 --> 12:55.900
when they see a group of us,
that we're gonna fight.

12:55.983 --> 12:58.235
-Yes.
-Oh, my gosh, when I was leaving the house

12:58.319 --> 13:01.697
for this trip, Brian's like,
"Oh, have fun crying with your ladies."

13:01.781 --> 13:02.948
I was like...

13:03.032 --> 13:05.242
Anyway, you know,
he was just joking, of course, but--

13:05.493 --> 13:06.702
Brian and his jokes.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.954
-Yeah.
-I feel bad for Tammy, you know.

13:09.121 --> 13:11.957
She clearly just hasn't had friends
like you in her life.

13:12.124 --> 13:14.502
You know, we are so... lucky.

13:14.919 --> 13:16.504
I love you turkeys so much.

13:16.587 --> 13:18.964
-Oh, I love you, turkey.
-Love you, guys.

13:19.423 --> 13:21.675
So, how much further is this place,
anyway?

13:21.967 --> 13:24.220
Sorry, I thought
it was a little more walkable.

13:24.303 --> 13:25.429
Oh, well, I mean, I'm good.

13:25.513 --> 13:28.432
I got my comfy boots on, so...
No heels for me with my back.

13:28.933 --> 13:31.769
You know you can heal your back
with your mind?

13:31.977 --> 13:33.312
You know that's not true?

13:37.233 --> 13:38.943
How you doing, Val, are you okay?

13:39.527 --> 13:40.361
Yeah.

13:40.736 --> 13:42.530
Oh, you should see
what these new knees can do.

13:42.613 --> 13:43.823
Hold this for a second.

13:43.906 --> 13:44.907
Check this shit out.

13:48.452 --> 13:50.454
Holy... Wow, Val!

13:52.540 --> 13:53.791
Oh, shit!

13:54.500 --> 13:55.668
Keep going, Val!

13:55.918 --> 13:57.127
We'll catch up!

14:04.134 --> 14:06.178
-Cheers, dears!
-Cheers!

14:06.387 --> 14:07.680
Love you.

14:07.805 --> 14:08.931
-Cheers!
-Hello, ladies!

14:09.014 --> 14:11.475
My name is Jade.
I'll be your server tonight.

14:11.559 --> 14:13.477
-Hi Jade.
-Hi.

14:14.478 --> 14:16.856
Jade, we're really hungry,
so we're gonna order really fast.

14:16.939 --> 14:19.066
And we know what we want,
so maybe you should get some water,

14:19.149 --> 14:20.985
and then I'll tell you
about our food allergies.

14:21.068 --> 14:22.152
Okay, sounds good.

14:22.528 --> 14:24.989
Thank you, Jade.
And we appreciate you, Jade.

14:26.198 --> 14:27.074
No prob.

14:29.118 --> 14:31.078
-Am I saying her name too much?
-Yeah.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.956
Guys, I just heard myself talk. I'm sorry.

14:34.039 --> 14:36.750
I know I get weird, bossy energy
on these trips.

14:36.834 --> 14:39.169
-No, you're fine
-Oh, my God. Not even.

14:39.336 --> 14:40.963
-Guys--
-You don't that much.

14:41.046 --> 14:42.965
-You do not!
-I'm gonna try to rein it in.

14:43.048 --> 14:45.384
I want this to go well,
and I'm afraid I'm gonna screw it up.

14:45.467 --> 14:47.970
Honey, it's so fun.
We're having such a good time.

14:48.095 --> 14:50.472
You know what?
That's just great self-feedback.

14:51.932 --> 14:52.766
Thank you.

14:52.933 --> 14:55.311
Why are you saying "feedback"
all the time?

14:56.478 --> 14:57.897
It's this thing
I've been doing at my practice.

14:57.980 --> 14:59.481
It just provides an emotional buffer.

14:59.565 --> 15:02.276
So, rather than just launch
into "your take" on something

15:02.359 --> 15:03.694
or just give advice, you say,

15:03.903 --> 15:05.654
"May I offer you some feedback?"

15:05.738 --> 15:06.572
Have you ever...

15:07.031 --> 15:08.782
tried that feedback thing on Brian?

15:10.576 --> 15:11.493
Well...

15:13.203 --> 15:15.164
<i>May I offer you some feedback?</i>

15:15.247 --> 15:18.167
<i>-Offer you some feedback</i>
<i>-May I offer you some feedback?</i>

15:18.375 --> 15:21.879
<i>-Ready for some feedback</i>
<i>-Feedback</i>

15:22.504 --> 15:25.466
<i>-Feedback!</i>
<i>-Ready for some feedback!</i>

15:25.758 --> 15:26.717
That was good.

15:28.093 --> 15:29.345
That is smoking!

15:29.887 --> 15:31.972
-...on the side.
-I'll share this with you.

15:32.056 --> 15:36.018
So, ladies, we have lavender popping corn,

15:36.393 --> 15:38.395
and beside that, there's a <i>demi cruet</i>

15:38.479 --> 15:41.315
of <i>fleur de sel</i>
for you to sprinkle on for a light zest.

15:41.398 --> 15:44.652
-This is such an interesting combination.
-That's not enough.

15:44.735 --> 15:46.028
So, where are you guys all from?

15:46.654 --> 15:49.365
We're from all over.
I'm originally from Chicago.

15:49.448 --> 15:51.742
-We all met in Chicago--
-Oh, nice, cool.

15:51.825 --> 15:53.577
My ex-girlfriend just moved there,

15:53.661 --> 15:55.829
so I'm a little mad at Chicago
at the moment, but...

15:57.539 --> 15:58.666
All right, enjoy.

16:00.751 --> 16:02.586
Did you hear the "ex-girlfriend" thing?

16:02.670 --> 16:03.545
Jackpot.

16:04.088 --> 16:06.048
Oh, sweet Jesus, I have service.

16:06.131 --> 16:09.635
-Oh, yes.
-Oh, my God, yes.

16:10.260 --> 16:12.721
Oh, no! They went bowling, you guys.

16:14.723 --> 16:16.308
Adrian, comma...

16:16.392 --> 16:19.812
Find out how long I have to decide,
period.

16:19.895 --> 16:20.896
My cat took her pill.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.816
I'm not understanding
this weekend deadline.

16:23.899 --> 16:26.485
Question mark,
exclamation point, send.

16:28.779 --> 16:30.990
Ladies, phones down.

16:31.073 --> 16:33.492
Come on. You know what?
We should be looking at each other.

16:33.575 --> 16:34.410
She's right.

16:34.493 --> 16:35.369
Adrian, comma,

16:35.452 --> 16:38.205
the pressure to make
a show decision is not--

16:38.747 --> 16:40.541
I'm sorry. No, I'll stop.

16:40.624 --> 16:41.458
No, stop!

16:41.542 --> 16:43.460
Siri, no, I'm <i>dictating.</i> Dic--

16:45.004 --> 16:45.879
Dick-tasting.

16:46.255 --> 16:47.464
What the hell is that?

16:47.631 --> 16:50.050
-She suggested "dick-tasting"?
-It's ridiculous.

16:50.134 --> 16:55.431
-Rebecca!
-Guys! Not until Sunday!

16:55.514 --> 16:58.100
I told you, I didn't want this to be
all about me this weekend.

16:58.183 --> 16:59.143
Everybody!

16:59.226 --> 17:02.521
<i>Happy, happy birthday</i>
<i>It's your special day</i>

17:02.604 --> 17:04.732
<i>Have a slice of pizza</i>
<i>What's your favorite way?</i>

17:04.815 --> 17:06.025
<i>-Hey!</i>
-What's your favorite way?

17:06.108 --> 17:07.067
Mushroom and peppers.

17:07.151 --> 17:10.194
<i>Mushroom and peppers</i>
<i>Mushroom and peppers</i>

17:10.279 --> 17:13.406
<i>Mushroom and peppers</i>
<i>Mushroom and peppers, hey!</i>

17:13.781 --> 17:14.742
-Jade.
-Yeah?

17:14.825 --> 17:17.911
This is a song we used to sing
at the pizza place we used to work at.

17:17.994 --> 17:19.413
Antonio's.

17:19.496 --> 17:21.205
Antonio's, hey!

17:21.957 --> 17:24.042
And long story short,
we're giving you a huge tip.

17:24.126 --> 17:25.877
Hey, so what's
your favorite pizza topping?

17:25.961 --> 17:27.378
-I'm a vegan...
-She's a vegan.

17:27.463 --> 17:30.841
...so smoked tempeh and jalapeños.

17:31.050 --> 17:34.178
<i>Smoked tempeh and jalapeños</i>
<i>Smoked tempeh and jalapeños</i>

17:34.303 --> 17:37.765
<i>Smoked tempeh and jalapeños</i>
<i>Smoked tempeh and jalapeños</i>

17:37.848 --> 17:38.724
Yeah!

17:38.807 --> 17:42.686
Ho ho ho! Merry Vagmas!

17:42.770 --> 17:44.396
-Merry Vagmas?
-And my name's...

17:44.605 --> 17:45.606
Dilda Claus!

17:45.689 --> 17:46.648
Oh, my!

17:47.066 --> 17:48.984
Jolly old Saint Dick.

17:49.985 --> 17:52.071
The first one that gets a gift...

17:52.863 --> 17:55.532
the biggest gift, is Naomi.

17:56.325 --> 17:58.160
-Thank you.
-Because she pushed out

17:58.368 --> 18:00.829
four beautiful, big babies.

18:00.913 --> 18:01.872
This is true, I--

18:01.955 --> 18:04.875
So it's like ringing a bell,
right, Naomi? Enjoy.

18:04.958 --> 18:07.753
It is. It's like a wet paper bag
down there. Thank you.

18:07.836 --> 18:10.339
This one, I call the "hush puppy."

18:10.798 --> 18:13.342
You can sit on this one in a coffee shop.

18:13.425 --> 18:14.760
Oh, my God.

18:15.219 --> 18:16.386
You there, Abby!

18:16.470 --> 18:18.722
-Who, me?
-I have heard that you don't care

18:18.806 --> 18:19.973
for a wasted moment.

18:20.057 --> 18:21.975
-Wow.
-So, yours has a timer.

18:22.059 --> 18:23.644
No!

18:24.144 --> 18:26.897
Now, this one here is for you, Catherine,

18:26.980 --> 18:29.358
and it's called "The Executive."

18:29.441 --> 18:32.903
Make less deals and more squeals.

18:32.986 --> 18:36.031
Don't turn your bedroom
into the boardroom.

18:36.907 --> 18:40.327
This is for the <i>CE-Oh!</i>

18:42.454 --> 18:43.497
Here we go.

18:45.374 --> 18:49.086
Finally, the <i>pénis de résistance.</i>

18:49.169 --> 18:52.256
-Look at this little soldier.
-Oh, no!

18:53.215 --> 18:54.758
This is expensive,

18:54.842 --> 18:57.845
and this is cheap as shit
from the dollar store.

18:58.178 --> 19:00.264
So, remove hat before use.

19:00.848 --> 19:03.767
It also vibrates to the birthday song.
Listen.

19:08.021 --> 19:10.440
<i>Happy birthday...</i>

19:10.983 --> 19:12.860
I mean, I don't wanna say it was
the best time of my life

19:12.943 --> 19:14.862
'cause that's, you know, sad. But...

19:16.697 --> 19:18.323
it was the best time of my life.

19:18.407 --> 19:19.533
Well, life is real.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.119
And we were like...

19:23.787 --> 19:26.123
We were like sisters in the trenches.

19:26.206 --> 19:28.208
Like, the pizza trenches.

19:28.542 --> 19:30.627
-We were so brave.
-We were so brave.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.218
Did you just burp or fart?

19:39.011 --> 19:40.345
A little of both, I fear.

19:43.724 --> 19:45.475
I love that necklace.

19:45.559 --> 19:46.560
Oh, thank you.

19:46.852 --> 19:49.855
It's vintage. From my vintage store.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.691
-You have a vintage store?
-I do.

19:53.025 --> 19:55.027
-And you live in Portland?
-I do.

19:55.444 --> 19:56.695
Okay. Fuck, man,

19:56.778 --> 19:59.031
you are officially the coolest person
I know.

19:59.531 --> 20:02.784
Fuck, man, come to Portland.
There are so many of me.

20:03.535 --> 20:04.870
I doubt that.

20:05.162 --> 20:07.372
-You know what I'm scared of, though?
-What?

20:07.998 --> 20:09.958
I hope these napkins aren't haunted.

20:14.671 --> 20:16.131
That's amazing.

20:19.968 --> 20:22.596
Oh, you're so fucking funny, I can't--

20:22.679 --> 20:25.766
Oh, I'm funny,
that's how I... get the ladies.

20:25.849 --> 20:27.601
I do a lot of napkin tricks.

20:28.060 --> 20:28.894
Wait.

20:30.562 --> 20:31.480
-Okay.
-Oh.

20:31.563 --> 20:32.481
-I'm sorry.
-What?

20:32.606 --> 20:34.942
-I have to do this. I'm an artist.
-Yeah?

20:35.317 --> 20:36.443
Can I take your picture?

20:37.110 --> 20:39.196
You just--
You look really good in this light.

20:39.279 --> 20:40.113
-Really?
-Yeah.

20:40.280 --> 20:42.866
-Sure, you can take my picture.
-Okay, great.

20:42.950 --> 20:44.660
I'll take the glasses off.

20:44.868 --> 20:45.744
Okay...

20:50.540 --> 20:52.209
Check it. I put this...

20:52.876 --> 20:55.379
-cool filter on it.
-Oh, that's really nice.

20:55.545 --> 20:57.381
-Do you like it?
-I like that.

20:58.048 --> 21:00.342
Here, I'll send it to you.
Put in your number.

21:00.801 --> 21:01.635
Okay.

21:02.886 --> 21:04.429
You're not gonna believe
who's in this restaurant.

21:04.888 --> 21:06.265
-You'll never guess.
-Cher?

21:06.515 --> 21:08.058
-No, guess again.
-Dua Lipa?

21:08.141 --> 21:09.142
Who?

21:09.268 --> 21:10.727
-Hillary Clinton?
-Better!

21:10.936 --> 21:12.396
Childish Gambino?

21:12.771 --> 21:13.605
ASAP Rocky?

21:13.689 --> 21:15.524
Is that the one with the dollar sign S?

21:15.607 --> 21:16.608
No, that's Ke$ha.

21:16.692 --> 21:17.526
It's Keesha.

21:17.609 --> 21:18.443
-Is it?
-Yeah.

21:18.527 --> 21:21.154
-Holy shit, Keesha's here?
-No, ready?

21:21.863 --> 21:23.282
Brené Brown.

21:23.824 --> 21:25.534
Brené Brown?

21:25.617 --> 21:26.868
Wait, who is Brené Brown?

21:26.952 --> 21:29.705
Brené Brown, she did the famous TED Talk
about vulnerability.

21:29.997 --> 21:31.790
She's a researcher-storyteller...

21:31.915 --> 21:34.334
Shame, "courage is contagious,"

21:34.584 --> 21:37.296
<i>Oprah's SuperSoul Conversations, </i> nothing?

21:37.379 --> 21:40.882
-No, is she famous?
-Yeah, but she doesn't care about that.

21:40.966 --> 21:42.884
Okay, that tracks, I get that.

21:42.968 --> 21:45.053
We get famous people in here
all the time.

21:45.137 --> 21:46.388
Do you know who was in here last week?

21:46.471 --> 21:48.140
-Who?
-Future.

21:49.016 --> 21:51.727
-Wait, did I just miss a bunch of words?
-Future?

21:52.019 --> 21:53.812
Is the past coming next week?

21:54.438 --> 21:57.274
Holy shit, you guys, let's go meet Brené!

21:59.401 --> 22:00.652
Let's not bug her.

22:01.695 --> 22:02.779
Let's let her be.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.742
Hey, Ms. Brené, we're so sorry
to interrupt your dinner.

22:06.825 --> 22:09.453
-It's my birthday--
-Look at your skin. It's like marzipan.

22:09.536 --> 22:11.413
We just have like ten or 15 questions
for you.

22:11.788 --> 22:13.498
What's the difference between
braving the wilderness

22:13.582 --> 22:15.792
-and <i>becoming </i> the wilderness?
<i>-</i> Comfort transformation...

22:15.876 --> 22:17.669
How, when... and why?

22:17.753 --> 22:20.839
How can I be generous
in my assumptions of others

22:21.006 --> 22:22.758
-when I hate most people?
-Good one.

22:22.841 --> 22:25.802
Here's the thing. We can't be generous
toward other people...

22:26.303 --> 22:27.179
without boundaries.

22:27.262 --> 22:28.847
-Yes, Brené, yes.
-Boom!

22:28.972 --> 22:30.974
-Boom on the boundaries.
-So, boundaries.

22:31.183 --> 22:33.643
-Boundaries, that means--
-Oh, my God. Message received.

22:33.727 --> 22:36.188
-I'm sorry. I didn't even want to come.
-Got it, we'll come back later.

22:36.271 --> 22:37.230
What a thrill.

22:37.314 --> 22:40.275
<i>Give me your hand, darling</i>

22:40.609 --> 22:44.321
<i>Do you feel my heart beating?</i>

22:44.446 --> 22:47.616
<i>Do you understand?</i>

22:47.699 --> 22:50.035
<i>Do you feel the same?</i>

22:50.452 --> 22:54.748
<i>Am I only dreaming?</i>

22:54.831 --> 22:58.126
<i>Is this burning</i>

22:58.210 --> 23:04.508
<i>An eternal flame?</i>

23:06.385 --> 23:07.260
<i>I don't know.</i>

23:11.014 --> 23:14.768
Oh, fuck Ronald McDonald
for making Filet-O-Fish.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.229
Fuck him ten ways from Sunday.

23:17.312 --> 23:21.441
Everybody get their stretchy clothes on,
'cause we're gonna keep this party going!

23:30.075 --> 23:31.660
Okay, ladies...

23:31.827 --> 23:35.831
Gorgeous gaggle, sexy klatch, welcome...

23:36.581 --> 23:38.417
to the next chapter of your evening.

23:38.792 --> 23:41.294
Is it too early or too late
to have a next chapter?

23:41.378 --> 23:44.798
-I feel like it's already tomorrow night.
-Hold up. What is that?

23:45.507 --> 23:47.217
-What is that?
-Molly.

23:48.385 --> 23:50.637
Okay, seriously, before you get all weird
and judge me and stuff like that,

23:50.720 --> 23:53.807
I heard this super interesting podcast
on microdosing.

23:53.890 --> 23:57.519
Do you know about this? Okay?
So, we take a really small amount of MDMA,

23:57.644 --> 23:59.980
and, apparently,
it can create this common experience

24:00.063 --> 24:01.690
that's, like, super bonding.

24:01.898 --> 24:03.358
Okay, I'm listening.

24:03.442 --> 24:06.862
Anyway, so...
we... are doing molly tonight.

24:07.112 --> 24:10.073
I hear you,
but I don't think we are gonna do it.

24:10.490 --> 24:11.867
So, we're gonna do coke?

24:11.950 --> 24:13.952
No, it's like Ecstasy.

24:14.035 --> 24:16.079
Like... MDMA.

24:16.163 --> 24:18.623
I thought MDMA was that extreme fighting.

24:19.249 --> 24:21.001
Wait, do they do coke and then they fight?

24:21.084 --> 24:22.502
You guys, it's molly.

24:22.586 --> 24:25.589
I mean, I wanna, yes-and this,
but I'm just wondering,

24:25.672 --> 24:28.341
how does molly interact
with the drugs I'm currently taking?

24:28.550 --> 24:31.011
'Cause right now, I'm on Levothroid
and melatonin.

24:31.636 --> 24:33.972
-Things we say now.
-For reals, though.

24:34.306 --> 24:36.558
I'm on Wellbutrin and Farxiga.

24:36.808 --> 24:39.144
I think it's fine. I'm on Fluoxetine
and the Mirena IUD,

24:39.227 --> 24:41.229
and I think it's gonna be totally fine.
I really do.

24:41.313 --> 24:42.564
Guys, I'm on all kinds of stuff.

24:42.647 --> 24:44.483
Zoloft, Singulair...

24:44.941 --> 24:48.195
Raw Calcium,
black cohosh for night sweats, Zantac...

24:48.612 --> 24:51.990
Mykonos, Who-you-gonna-call-trex,
Queef-a-tram.

24:52.157 --> 24:55.535
Cath, I think what we're all trying to say
is maybe this isn't that kind of trip.

24:55.911 --> 24:57.204
You know what I mean, like...

24:57.329 --> 25:01.416
You know, we have a big day tomorrow,
and this is a marathon, it's not a sprint.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.335
I thought it was a birthday weekend.

25:03.960 --> 25:04.794
Well...

25:05.378 --> 25:06.338
Oh, okay.

25:07.464 --> 25:08.673
It's... totally...

25:08.757 --> 25:10.383
It's Rebecca's birthday. Anyway...

25:10.800 --> 25:13.136
you should download the podcast.
It's super interesting.

25:13.220 --> 25:14.679
It's this amazing TED Talk, actually.

25:14.763 --> 25:16.723
-It sounds amazing.
-I mean, I would do the podcast.

25:16.806 --> 25:18.183
I'd love to listen to the podcast.

25:18.266 --> 25:21.228
-I feel bad. I'm sorry.
-No, don't be sad.

25:21.311 --> 25:22.521
-No, it's fine.
-Know what? Apparently,

25:22.604 --> 25:24.648
we're just not that interested
in doing drugs.

25:25.398 --> 25:28.276
Except for the thousands of drugs
we just listed.

25:28.485 --> 25:30.237
I did Molly in college, but...

25:30.654 --> 25:32.197
she went back to her boyfriend.

25:33.990 --> 25:35.450
-Let's dance it out.
-Let's dance.

25:35.534 --> 25:39.913
-Dance it out!
-Dancing's my job.

25:39.996 --> 25:42.582
-What should our first song be?
-First song...

25:43.416 --> 25:46.920
"Sweet Child o' Mine," Guns N' Roses,
then we'll cascade into "Paradise City."

25:47.629 --> 25:49.297
Anything from the <i>Xanadu </i> soundtrack,

25:49.381 --> 25:51.466
-anything from <i>Flashdance </i> soundtrack.
-Yeah.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.051
I don't want any
Quentin Tarantino soundtracks.

25:53.134 --> 25:53.969
-Never.
-I'm done.

26:03.144 --> 26:04.646
Let's do a whole classic rock.

26:04.729 --> 26:06.398
Let's do Boston, Styx,

26:06.815 --> 26:08.733
Marshall Tucker Band, Lynyrd Skynyrd.

26:08.817 --> 26:10.694
"Tuesday's Gone," no "Sweet Home Alabama."

26:10.777 --> 26:12.404
Never. Kid Rock ruined it.

26:18.285 --> 26:21.037
-Natalie Merchant?
-Natalie Merchant, yes.

26:21.121 --> 26:23.373
-Lauryn Hill?
-Lauryn Hill, a hundred percent.

26:23.540 --> 26:25.584
-Bless it. What happened to her?
-Yeah, I don't know.

26:25.667 --> 26:27.502
She didn't pay her taxes. She went crazy.

26:37.387 --> 26:39.306
I think we should not play anything...

26:39.514 --> 26:40.890
later than "Hey Ya!"

26:41.850 --> 26:43.560
-Nothing current.
-Nothing current.

26:43.852 --> 26:45.437
-All right.
-Not tonight.

26:59.326 --> 27:00.327
Do you know what?

27:02.829 --> 27:04.664
I wished Prince's ghost...

27:06.249 --> 27:07.167
would come back...

27:07.876 --> 27:11.838
and... serenade me
for like two whole hours...

27:12.631 --> 27:14.424
and then make sweet love to me.

27:14.758 --> 27:15.800
Yeah, no shit.

27:17.510 --> 27:19.095
He fucking glided

27:19.179 --> 27:22.515
into that elevator in Paisley Park,
and that fucking door closed...

27:22.932 --> 27:23.850
And then, poof.

27:24.517 --> 27:25.477
Where's my baby?

27:25.644 --> 27:28.313
-Where's my Prince?
<i>-</i> Beautiful-ass Prince.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.607
I love my husband and shit, but, like...

27:31.608 --> 27:33.193
that's the love of my life.

27:33.443 --> 27:35.528
He had eyes like a beautiful newborn fawn.

27:36.363 --> 27:37.530
What was his pain?

27:38.531 --> 27:39.407
His hips.

27:39.491 --> 27:40.450
Oh, God, yeah.

27:41.451 --> 27:44.871
And who knows, you know? Life ain't easy.

27:44.954 --> 27:45.789
No.

27:45.872 --> 27:50.126
I feel like...
the universe is saying it to me.

27:50.210 --> 27:51.753
I hear the universe saying...

27:53.338 --> 27:54.673
"Your heroes are dying.

27:56.216 --> 27:57.300
You're getting old."

27:58.176 --> 28:00.345
-Dying is my worst fear.
-Same.

28:01.012 --> 28:03.056
I swear to God. If anything....

28:04.391 --> 28:05.392
happened to me...

28:06.476 --> 28:09.646
I just think about my poor kids.

28:10.355 --> 28:11.231
Like...

28:14.150 --> 28:15.360
My babies.

28:15.944 --> 28:18.738
-You know? Like, no one's...
-I know.

28:19.656 --> 28:21.408
No one's gonna love my babies...

28:21.741 --> 28:22.575
like I do.

28:22.992 --> 28:25.495
They're your sweet peas.
But I'm gonna tell you something.

28:25.578 --> 28:27.580
Remember, how Prince would throw
his guitar up in the air,

28:27.664 --> 28:28.998
and his guitar tech...

28:29.624 --> 28:32.335
would always catch the guitar
after a mind-blowing solo?

28:32.419 --> 28:33.253
Yeah.

28:34.546 --> 28:36.548
I'm... that person for you.

28:36.756 --> 28:38.800
I'll catch your guitar. Every time.

28:39.175 --> 28:40.677
I will always catch...

28:41.052 --> 28:46.307
your motherfucking guitar,
'cause you... are my... rock.

28:46.516 --> 28:48.685
I'm here for you. I'm your Apollonia.

28:49.269 --> 28:50.854
I'm your Vanity.

28:51.104 --> 28:52.856
-I love you.
-I love you.

28:54.232 --> 28:55.316
Will you marry me?

28:57.068 --> 28:57.902
Yeah.

29:04.159 --> 29:08.705
<i>I want us now to actually take a look</i>
<i>at the word "microdosing."</i>

29:08.955 --> 29:12.667
<i>"Mi." My experience, my emotions.</i>

29:13.293 --> 29:16.171
<i>"C." I am now going to see.</i>

29:16.755 --> 29:18.757
<i>I feel it in my emotions.</i>

29:19.174 --> 29:20.592
<i>There are different lakes.</i>

29:20.717 --> 29:25.555
<i>"Ro." Rowing your mental boat</i>
<i>down a different stream.</i>

30:36.584 --> 30:38.253
Shit! Fuck! Who the fuck are you?

30:38.336 --> 30:41.881
It's okay, I'm Devon.
I'm a nice person, I'm nice.

30:42.090 --> 30:44.092
-I'm allowed to--
-What is that?

30:44.217 --> 30:48.263
That's a squid...
for the paella I'm prepping.

30:49.472 --> 30:51.641
Did Tammy not tell you
I come with the house?

30:52.267 --> 30:54.936
No, she gave us the full download
on the toilet fountain,

30:55.311 --> 30:56.813
but she forgot to mention you.

30:57.438 --> 30:59.482
I don't know
what I was planning to do with this.

30:59.566 --> 31:00.775
-What's going on?
-Oh, my God.

31:01.109 --> 31:03.319
-Who is this asshole?
-This is...

31:05.446 --> 31:07.907
-Who are you?
-I'm Devon.

31:08.491 --> 31:09.909
I come with the house.

31:09.993 --> 31:12.370
Think of me as your driver,
your tour guide, your chef.

31:12.453 --> 31:14.122
I'm sorry I wasn't here,
by the way, yesterday.

31:14.205 --> 31:16.374
I was down in Bodega Bay,
spearing this little guy.

31:16.624 --> 31:18.126
Devon is making...

31:19.252 --> 31:21.671
-What are you making?
-My famous paella.

31:22.088 --> 31:23.923
Sorry, let me just grab this.

31:24.007 --> 31:25.675
-Oh, God.
-It's kind of a process.

31:26.050 --> 31:28.386
It takes a long time,
so I like to get a jump start on it.

31:28.511 --> 31:31.222
Look at that thing. It's beautiful.
I mean, that is beautiful.

31:31.931 --> 31:32.849
You hear that?

31:34.517 --> 31:37.604
Squid or cuttlefish?
What do you think this is?

31:37.687 --> 31:39.272
-God, that smells.
-It's a cuttlefish.

31:39.355 --> 31:41.274
A cuttlefish is a little bit different
than their cousins,

31:41.357 --> 31:44.569
but this has, actually,
what's called a cuttlebone inside of it.

31:44.652 --> 31:47.405
And... squid is faster as a predator.

31:47.614 --> 31:50.325
You're gonna see,
it takes on the flavor like a mother.

31:50.408 --> 31:52.285
I mean, it's really sweet.

31:52.368 --> 31:54.203
It wants to be flavored,

31:54.287 --> 31:57.540
and it's actually
a more traditional seafood protein

31:57.624 --> 31:59.667
to put in paella with the rice--

31:59.751 --> 32:01.836
-Could you put that on ice, please?
-Yeah, absolutely.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.422
Ladies, if there is anything
that you need, let me know.

32:04.505 --> 32:05.381
Anything at all.

32:05.632 --> 32:06.883
Because, as always...

32:09.552 --> 32:11.471
it's an amazing day in wine country.

32:12.138 --> 32:13.056
No, it's not.

32:13.139 --> 32:15.308
Oh, yeah, Devon, can you do me a favor?

32:15.391 --> 32:16.517
Can you help me...

32:17.143 --> 32:19.479
with the wind chimes
over the ceramic frogs?

32:19.938 --> 32:22.357
'Cause they're all tangled
in the dream catchers,

32:22.440 --> 32:23.942
and the sound has been keeping us up
all night.

32:24.025 --> 32:26.444
God damn it. I'm so sorry.
Sleep is so important.

32:27.612 --> 32:30.073
-Show me.
-There was a really loud bird out here.

32:30.156 --> 32:31.783
So sorry to hear. I'll shut these later.

32:31.866 --> 32:33.534
Do you have a key, or how did you get in?

32:33.618 --> 32:35.244
Hey, how we feeling, ladies?

32:41.417 --> 32:43.044
I feel like hot garbage.

32:44.128 --> 32:45.505
Should we make coffee?

32:46.881 --> 32:47.715
Yeah.

32:49.425 --> 32:51.219
What the fuck is this?

32:53.638 --> 32:54.639
That's...

32:55.431 --> 32:57.809
That's seafood from... Devon.

32:58.518 --> 33:00.478
-Who's Devon?
-He comes with the house.

33:08.861 --> 33:09.779
Do we...

33:11.280 --> 33:13.783
-hit the button?
-Gotta push the button.

33:14.701 --> 33:17.537
-Should I push the button?
-Or I could do it.

33:19.038 --> 33:22.625
Wait, did you already take a shower,
or are you about to take a shower?

33:24.085 --> 33:24.961
What?

33:26.421 --> 33:27.255
I don't know.

33:32.135 --> 33:35.013
Does this house have a tea thingy? Like...

33:37.140 --> 33:38.599
You know what I mean, like...

33:40.143 --> 33:41.936
Like a hot water source.

33:43.354 --> 33:44.647
-A kettle!
-Kettle.

33:44.731 --> 33:45.565
A kettle.

33:45.815 --> 33:47.316
Man, I am not doing great.

33:49.068 --> 33:50.820
Yeah, what did I say last night?

33:50.945 --> 33:53.948
I feel like I went on and on
about... somebody's mom.

33:54.282 --> 33:56.534
Oh, wait, did everyone hang out
after I went to bed?

33:57.035 --> 33:58.661
Are there any inside jokes
I should get caught up on?

33:58.745 --> 33:59.996
No, we all went to bed.

34:02.206 --> 34:03.583
Devon breaks in at 7:00 a.m.,

34:03.666 --> 34:05.877
-but now he rings the doorbell?
-Who's Devon?

34:05.960 --> 34:06.836
He comes with the house.

34:08.254 --> 34:09.213
It's the tarot card reader.

34:09.964 --> 34:10.840
The what?

34:10.922 --> 34:13.051
-Oh, no!
-On the itinerary.

34:14.802 --> 34:16.763
Maybe she can get the coffee to work.

34:16.888 --> 34:18.764
Her name's... Lady Sunshine.

34:19.306 --> 34:20.850
Hi, you must be Lady--

34:20.933 --> 34:23.018
This house was impossible to find.

34:23.978 --> 34:25.103
Not marked.

34:25.228 --> 34:27.190
I'm a psychic, not Magellan.

34:27.815 --> 34:28.690
Oh, boy.

34:29.442 --> 34:31.402
Okay, when I figure out
where I'm gonna place myself,

34:31.485 --> 34:33.780
I'm gonna need you to put this somewhere
where I can see it.

34:33.862 --> 34:34.697
Okay.

34:34.781 --> 34:35.614
No.

34:37.283 --> 34:39.409
We're gonna have to smudge
the heck out of this space.

34:40.036 --> 34:41.788
The juju <i>es no bueno.</i>

34:42.746 --> 34:45.123
Honey, take this...

34:45.833 --> 34:48.710
and go all around the room with it,
really wave it around.

34:50.630 --> 34:52.590
-Don't be shy.
-Okay.

34:55.259 --> 34:56.928
Okay, smudging not working.

34:57.011 --> 34:59.138
We're gonna have to go
to a different room.

34:59.472 --> 35:01.599
One that is not contaminated.

35:01.766 --> 35:03.559
-Preferably...
-Just let it go...

35:03.643 --> 35:05.311
if I may offer some feedback.

35:05.603 --> 35:07.814
<i>Are you ready for some feedback?</i>

35:08.022 --> 35:09.065
Oh, no.

35:09.565 --> 35:10.983
Are you a singing group?

35:11.484 --> 35:13.069
No, just friends.

35:17.949 --> 35:18.866
We'll see.

35:20.451 --> 35:21.494
The Chariot.

35:23.121 --> 35:26.249
Oh, my God,
that would make a beautiful tattoo.

35:29.043 --> 35:31.671
The Chariot is a very positive card...

35:31.963 --> 35:32.797
Oh, really?

35:32.880 --> 35:35.216
...when it's right-side up.
Yours is upside down.

35:36.050 --> 35:37.510
The upside-down Chariot...

35:37.969 --> 35:40.763
tells me that you're being dragged
through time with no control

35:40.847 --> 35:42.682
over where life is taking you.

35:42.974 --> 35:44.976
A big change has upended you.

35:46.060 --> 35:46.978
You're free-falling.

35:47.687 --> 35:49.981
You're killing yourself staying busy,

35:50.273 --> 35:51.858
because if you don't, you feel...

35:52.191 --> 35:54.610
as if you will literally break apart.

35:55.903 --> 35:57.905
It'd still make a killer tattoo.

36:00.032 --> 36:00.908
Who's next?

36:03.619 --> 36:04.579
That's not good.

36:07.039 --> 36:08.416
The Five of Pentacles.

36:08.916 --> 36:12.628
Many say this card signifies
financial loss, poverty.

36:13.129 --> 36:15.673
Well, I'm lucky
'cause I'm very comfortable,

36:15.756 --> 36:19.260
but I do have an opportunity
I would love to ask you about.

36:19.343 --> 36:22.221
It's... a TV job.

36:23.139 --> 36:24.932
I wonder what the card says about that.

36:26.309 --> 36:27.351
May I continue?

36:28.436 --> 36:29.270
Yeah, of course.

36:29.562 --> 36:33.107
Many say that this card signifies
financial loss, poverty.

36:33.316 --> 36:34.901
-Okay.
-But not me.

36:34.984 --> 36:35.818
She flipped it.

36:35.902 --> 36:40.072
I find that the Five of Pentacles points
to <i>emotional </i> poverty.

36:43.326 --> 36:44.994
So, nothing about the TV show?

36:49.248 --> 36:50.208
The Fool.

36:51.375 --> 36:53.336
You want a tattoo of this one as well?

36:56.380 --> 36:57.757
I liked the Chariot better.

36:57.840 --> 37:01.427
The Fool represents new beginnings,
optimism.

37:02.220 --> 37:04.430
Man, I'm really ready to meet somebody.

37:05.139 --> 37:07.808
Well, the Fool has difficulty seizing
on new opportunities

37:07.892 --> 37:10.436
because they're too focused
on the needs of others.

37:11.854 --> 37:14.398
Are you saying I should put my knees...

37:14.815 --> 37:16.901
before others' needs?

37:23.032 --> 37:24.033
They laughed.

37:24.659 --> 37:25.618
Next.

37:29.330 --> 37:30.331
The Devil.

37:30.790 --> 37:33.876
The Devil represents the violent forces
of nature

37:33.960 --> 37:36.045
that can strain you-- Where did she go?

37:36.170 --> 37:37.713
I don't think this is her jam.

37:37.797 --> 37:39.548
I don't think this is anyone's jam.

37:41.550 --> 37:42.385
Death.

37:43.469 --> 37:44.762
-Fuck me!
-Jesus Christ!

37:45.221 --> 37:47.515
-You're fired!
-No, I love this card,

37:47.598 --> 37:50.559
because people always think
that this is a very negative card.

37:50.643 --> 37:53.062
They're scared of it.
But the Death card actually indicates

37:53.145 --> 37:54.814
a time of transformation.

37:55.106 --> 37:57.942
The death of the old you
to make way for the new.

37:58.317 --> 37:59.777
A metamorphosis.

37:59.860 --> 38:01.654
You're ready to become a butterfly.

38:02.697 --> 38:04.782
But it can also mean death is coming.

38:07.660 --> 38:08.494
Okay.

38:11.747 --> 38:13.207
The Wheel of Fortune.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.751
Wheel... of...

38:15.835 --> 38:18.379
-For--
-The Wheel represents life cycles.

38:19.088 --> 38:20.172
A turning point.

38:20.881 --> 38:23.634
-The big change is coming.
-Her 50th birthday.

38:24.260 --> 38:25.386
Half a century.

38:27.221 --> 38:28.222
That's a long time.

38:29.181 --> 38:30.266
Fifty years of age.

38:30.933 --> 38:33.602
And see how Lady Fortuna
is just standing here,

38:33.686 --> 38:35.646
in the middle of this wheel of change?

38:35.730 --> 38:37.440
-She is unmoving.
-All right, yeah.

38:37.523 --> 38:40.484
Right. Tranquil, peaceful.

38:40.776 --> 38:42.653
Over, done.

38:44.530 --> 38:46.115
And now, for the group reading.

38:46.407 --> 38:48.784
You know, no.
I think this is when we say goodbye.

38:48.868 --> 38:50.369
-Yeah, I'm doing--
-I've gotta...

38:50.453 --> 38:51.829
-Yeah, we're done.
-Me, too.

38:54.123 --> 38:55.708
Yeah, you're right. Never mind.

38:55.791 --> 38:57.376
Wait, why? What does it say?

38:58.461 --> 38:59.378
Is it bad?

39:00.046 --> 39:02.590
The garden looks like a winner.

39:02.673 --> 39:06.802
Usually, yes, but not when it's sandwiched
between the snakes and the rocks.

39:07.553 --> 39:09.680
You see, the fighting snakes show me...

39:10.139 --> 39:12.475
that you all surround yourselves
with battles.

39:13.100 --> 39:17.146
People who have been intertwined
and dueling for thousands of years.

39:18.022 --> 39:21.984
You need to help shed the tough skins
that have built up over time...

39:22.318 --> 39:24.028
if you are to remain friends.

39:24.737 --> 39:25.863
A lot of secrets.

39:26.655 --> 39:28.366
Many things unspoken.

39:28.699 --> 39:29.950
And you see the space?

39:30.326 --> 39:31.994
No one's as close as they think.

39:32.495 --> 39:34.705
And you see here, with the river stones?

39:35.164 --> 39:39.168
They're gems. They used to be dynamic
and many-faceted.

39:39.502 --> 39:41.379
And they have been worn over time.

39:41.545 --> 39:44.548
And now, they're smooth and dull...

39:45.424 --> 39:46.342
aged.

39:49.428 --> 39:51.180
From one old lady to another...

39:52.348 --> 39:53.766
get over all your shit,

39:54.433 --> 39:56.352
'cause it is later than you think.

40:05.653 --> 40:07.738
That'll be $475.

40:09.281 --> 40:11.742
<i>Hello, this is Olivia</i>
<i>from Dr. Melton's office</i>

40:11.826 --> 40:13.744
<i>calling to let you know that the results--</i>

40:14.870 --> 40:16.122
Move it or lose it. I'm up.

40:16.205 --> 40:18.082
Got it.
Don't wanna fuck up that itinerary.

40:18.165 --> 40:19.500
We got our marching orders.

40:20.084 --> 40:20.960
Hey, oh.

40:26.298 --> 40:27.842
Sorry, is this any better?

40:28.175 --> 40:31.220
So, what's going on with the offer?
Is it any-- Hello?

40:32.263 --> 40:33.097
Hello?

40:33.639 --> 40:35.683
Shitballs! Hello?

40:35.808 --> 40:37.518
-Hello? Shit, fuck!
-Sorry.

40:38.102 --> 40:40.938
Not being nosy, just wanted
to bring some of my hangover cure.

40:41.355 --> 40:42.648
Oh, thanks.

40:42.731 --> 40:45.484
Oh, and some of my edible soaps
for you, too.

40:45.568 --> 40:46.527
Sorry, I...

40:47.319 --> 40:50.489
I know I should be enjoying myself
and not stressing about work.

40:50.739 --> 40:52.116
Hey, I'm not judging.

40:52.450 --> 40:57.037
Owning and managing five properties
has its share of shit-fuck days for sure.

40:57.788 --> 41:00.458
But I bet you get to meet
a lot of interesting people, so...

41:01.584 --> 41:04.128
No. No, you'd be surprised.

41:04.253 --> 41:05.504
People are all the same.

41:07.590 --> 41:09.341
I go whole days without speaking.

41:11.260 --> 41:13.262
Better get to the wine tasting, so...

41:15.222 --> 41:16.640
A little advice for today.

41:17.516 --> 41:20.394
If you or anyone around you
starts a sentence with:

41:20.478 --> 41:23.022
"Can I just say something?"
stop right there.

41:23.105 --> 41:24.982
Okay, I will keep that in mind, thank you.

41:25.399 --> 41:26.233
Try the juice.

41:33.073 --> 41:36.702
It's got kind of a garbage flavor,
but the soap helps with the aftertaste.

41:38.370 --> 41:39.788
-Edible?
-Seventy percent.

41:46.170 --> 41:48.088
I can still taste the soap a little bit.

41:48.756 --> 41:50.966
It's just in your head.
It's 'cause of the shape.

41:51.217 --> 41:53.552
Now, as you can see,
this little beauty is quite spacious

41:53.636 --> 41:56.639
and does come
with four-by-four off-road capability.

41:56.805 --> 41:59.058
So, if you see some beautiful spot,
and you say to yourself:

41:59.141 --> 42:01.227
"I'd like to get up close and personal
with that vista,

42:01.310 --> 42:04.522
but the terrain is clearly a no-go,"
think again. I got you.

42:04.855 --> 42:06.065
Yeah, we got it, man.

42:06.148 --> 42:08.442
This van has everything here.
We've got seats like...

42:08.526 --> 42:10.945
-Who is this guy again?
-Abby's worst nightmare.

42:11.028 --> 42:14.240
...cup holders,
really nice adjustable air and fan,

42:14.323 --> 42:16.408
safety lights, emergency kit--

42:16.492 --> 42:18.369
Okay, let's get driving.

42:18.661 --> 42:20.788
We have a birthday we need to celebrate.

42:22.206 --> 42:24.333
How old are you turning, little mama, 21?

42:25.000 --> 42:26.710
Devon, it's none of your business.

42:26.919 --> 42:30.214
No, you know, I'm not ashamed to say,
actually, I am turning 50 tomorrow.

42:31.173 --> 42:32.049
Yeah!

42:32.341 --> 42:35.177
Great, yeah... You say it, sister!

42:35.344 --> 42:36.595
Okay, can we go?

42:36.720 --> 42:37.555
All right.

42:38.973 --> 42:41.183
<i>Birthday to you</i>

42:42.560 --> 42:43.978
<i>Your birthday</i>

42:47.773 --> 42:50.526
Overshot it. I hear things a touch sharp.

42:50.859 --> 42:52.361
Devon, let's go.

42:52.444 --> 42:53.404
-Yeah. Here we go.
-Okay.

42:53.487 --> 42:57.074
Hold that for a moment, would you?
All right, 10-4, captain.

42:58.617 --> 43:01.287
So, ladies,
a little early history of the Napa Valley.

43:01.370 --> 43:05.708
The first official winery and vineyard
was established by one Mr. John Patchett,

43:06.000 --> 43:08.627
who began planting grape vines in 1854--

43:08.711 --> 43:10.879
So, Val,
did that cute waitress text you back?

43:10.963 --> 43:13.924
-Is there romance in the air?
-Devon, don't listen to our conversation.

43:14.216 --> 43:16.218
No, but she's probably still sleeping.

43:16.510 --> 43:18.804
That picture she took of you is gorgeous.

43:18.887 --> 43:20.097
-Thanks.
-What picture?

43:20.598 --> 43:22.600
Oh, it's on the shared photo site we have.

43:22.683 --> 43:24.226
You probably didn't accept the invite.

43:24.310 --> 43:25.477
No, I didn't get one.

43:25.603 --> 43:27.605
Would you send me a invite? I'll accept.

43:28.147 --> 43:30.774
-Probably just the Wi-Fi.
-Signal is hard to come by out here.

43:30.858 --> 43:32.443
I'll tell you what's not hard to come by:

43:33.235 --> 43:36.071
a rich and hearty Cab Sauv
with healthy levels of tannins.

43:36.155 --> 43:38.240
Which brings me back
to John Patchett in 1854--

43:38.532 --> 43:40.659
I do not wanna learn about wine
on this trip.

43:40.743 --> 43:41.869
This is weird, Cat.

43:41.952 --> 43:42.995
You're not on here.

43:43.662 --> 43:46.123
Way to go, guys.
Who started the shared site?

43:46.206 --> 43:48.792
Oh, I did,
but I didn't intentionally leave you off.

43:49.293 --> 43:51.629
Remember, let's remain uncontaminated

43:51.712 --> 43:54.006
from Lady Sunshine's negative suggestions.

43:54.089 --> 43:55.841
-Amen.
-Yes, we are uncontaminated.

43:55.924 --> 43:58.260
Uncontaminated. All right, added.

43:58.344 --> 44:00.012
Hey, should we listen to some tunes?

44:00.095 --> 44:02.848
-Let's do DUI songs.
-Yes!

44:03.098 --> 44:04.600
You guys got DUIs, too?

44:04.683 --> 44:06.935
No, it's a game we play.

44:07.019 --> 44:10.022
It's like guilty pleasure songs we blast
when we're tipsy.

44:10.522 --> 44:13.192
Are you... legally allowed to drive?

44:13.359 --> 44:14.193
I will be.

44:17.655 --> 44:19.031
-Yes.
-Yeah!

44:21.033 --> 44:24.953
...less than 4.04% of the wine in America.

44:25.412 --> 44:26.288
Devon, shh!

44:26.372 --> 44:28.874
<i>Looking out a dirty old window</i>

44:29.249 --> 44:32.961
<i>Down below the cars</i>
<i>In the city go rushing by</i>

44:34.463 --> 44:39.593
<i>I sit here alone and I wonder why</i>

44:41.345 --> 44:44.139
<i>Friday night and everyone's moving</i>

44:44.348 --> 44:48.227
<i>I can feel the heat, but it's soothing,</i>
<i>Heading down</i>

44:49.478 --> 44:53.941
<i>I search for the beat in this dirty town</i>
<i>Downtown</i>

44:54.024 --> 44:56.193
<i>The young ones are going</i>

44:56.360 --> 44:58.737
<i>Downtown, the young ones are growing</i>

44:59.321 --> 45:02.282
<i>-We're the kids in America</i>
<i>-Whoa</i>

45:02.366 --> 45:05.160
<i>-We're the kids in America</i>
<i>-Whoa</i>

45:05.244 --> 45:08.330
<i>Everybody lives for the music-go-round</i>

45:18.424 --> 45:21.343
Ladies, if Cabernet Sauvignon
is the king of wine country,

45:21.427 --> 45:24.346
Chardonnay is its queen. It's bold--

45:24.430 --> 45:26.640
Okay, hair of the dog.

45:26.765 --> 45:28.934
All right, fine, go to a wine store, then.

45:30.144 --> 45:31.228
I just wanna say...

45:32.730 --> 45:34.523
that we never know
where life is gonna take us.

45:34.606 --> 45:36.066
So let's live for today...

45:36.358 --> 45:39.194
and party till our panties fly off.
Wait, where is Catherine?

45:39.278 --> 45:42.281
I think she had to call her agent.
Please don't say "panties."

45:42.364 --> 45:44.324
Oh, hell to the hell to the no!

45:44.408 --> 45:45.534
I'm gonna go get her.

45:48.746 --> 45:50.873
Anyone picking up on the notes
of honeysuckle?

45:51.790 --> 45:53.417
-Yeah, sure.
-Get a good sniff.

45:53.917 --> 45:56.336
Let me know what you smell.
There's no wrong answers.

45:57.004 --> 45:57.963
Green apple?

45:58.213 --> 46:00.215
-Yes.
-Yes, very good. Green apple.

46:02.509 --> 46:05.137
I wanna say... canned peaches?

46:06.305 --> 46:07.222
No.

46:07.973 --> 46:09.475
You said there's no wrong answer.

46:09.558 --> 46:11.185
Yeah, but... you know.

46:12.060 --> 46:14.062
Peaches, there's no peaches in there.

46:14.646 --> 46:15.981
-Okay.
-What else you got?

46:16.899 --> 46:19.109
-Oh, lemon.
-Yes, very good.

46:19.193 --> 46:20.569
I taste the lemon, yeah.

46:20.652 --> 46:22.196
You don't taste it, you smell it.

46:22.488 --> 46:23.363
Grapes.

46:23.906 --> 46:25.407
Well, yeah... of course.

46:25.699 --> 46:27.284
Nice, that's smart!

46:27.367 --> 46:29.369
-Definitely grapes in there.
-Can't go wrong with that.

46:30.913 --> 46:33.999
-Jasmine.
-No, that's... egregious.

46:34.583 --> 46:35.709
Pinot-gregious.

46:36.794 --> 46:39.046
-Thank you.
-You're killing it!

46:40.339 --> 46:41.590
Oh, we lost Mason.

46:41.799 --> 46:43.467
So, is it like <i> The Catherine Stewart Show,</i>

46:43.550 --> 46:45.969
or is it like I'm one of three judges,
you know what I mean?

46:46.053 --> 46:50.265
'Cause that's sort of significant
in terms of what... I'm talking about.

46:50.933 --> 46:52.017
You know what I mean?

46:52.226 --> 46:54.770
Right,
if it's <i>Catherine Stewart of Cutie Pies</i>

46:54.853 --> 46:57.648
or <i>Cutie Pies featuring Catherine Stewart,</i>
and, like...

46:58.273 --> 47:00.192
Can you hold on one second?
Something's going on in front of me.

47:00.275 --> 47:02.861
-What are you doing?
-My God, give me my phone back.

47:02.945 --> 47:05.739
-That's an important phone call.
-My face is an important phone call.

47:05.823 --> 47:08.075
I'm not giving you
your precious phone back...

47:08.534 --> 47:10.911
until you start flossing.

47:11.161 --> 47:11.995
Come on.

47:12.162 --> 47:13.038
All right, fine.

47:13.288 --> 47:15.833
<i>Do it</i>

47:15.916 --> 47:18.085
Okay, oh, my God, I'm nailing this.
I'm really good at this.

47:18.168 --> 47:21.171
-She'll call you back. She's flossing.
-I gotta floss more when I'm day-drunk.

47:21.255 --> 47:22.923
Here's the last thing I sent to her:

47:23.006 --> 47:26.718
"I have vintage jade earrings at my store.
Would love to send them to you."

47:27.427 --> 47:28.303
So dumb.

47:28.929 --> 47:33.100
She's Jade... you know?
She's got like a million jade things.

47:33.350 --> 47:34.476
I made a mistake.

47:35.435 --> 47:36.895
She's too young for me.

47:37.563 --> 47:38.397
Val.

47:39.231 --> 47:41.108
May I offer you some feedback?

47:41.650 --> 47:42.484
Go for it.

47:42.568 --> 47:46.780
Okay, I mean, when it comes to age,
the number itself truly doesn't matter.

47:46.864 --> 47:47.823
It's, I mean...

47:47.906 --> 47:50.659
I wish Abby could understand this,
'cause she's coming at me like,

47:50.742 --> 47:51.994
"You're 50!" It's like,

47:52.494 --> 47:54.872
what matters is how you feel inside, so...

47:55.664 --> 47:59.751
with all that in mind,
what would you say your soul's age is?

48:00.294 --> 48:01.837
I'd say, like, 12.

48:02.671 --> 48:06.341
I mean, maybe a little older.
Probably old enough to drink... and bone.

48:06.925 --> 48:09.094
Maybe 18, 18 and a half.

48:10.387 --> 48:11.722
Almost out of the house.

48:12.931 --> 48:14.433
Don't have my own car yet.

48:15.225 --> 48:16.184
But I have a bike.

48:18.186 --> 48:20.939
-This one's good. What's it called again?
-White wine.

48:21.189 --> 48:22.107
Fricking love it!

48:22.316 --> 48:23.775
So, can I just say something?

48:23.859 --> 48:27.279
Rebecca is in complete denial
that this is her birthday weekend.

48:27.362 --> 48:29.907
You know, as usual,
she's glossing over everything.

48:30.115 --> 48:32.451
There's so many things
she doesn't deal with.

48:32.826 --> 48:35.579
-Hello, Brian.
-Fucking Brian.

48:35.662 --> 48:38.123
She's gotta be having feelings
about turning 50.

48:38.540 --> 48:39.917
Where does she put it all?

48:40.626 --> 48:43.420
"This is just another trip,
it's not a big deal." It's like...

48:43.503 --> 48:44.922
Hello? Get into it!

48:45.339 --> 48:47.591
God, you know how hard it is,
by the way...

48:47.758 --> 48:50.802
to make 10,000 reservations for 400 people

48:50.886 --> 48:53.472
at 55 million different locations?

48:53.555 --> 48:57.559
I know. Abby, you've done such a good job
at planning this. You should know that.

48:58.769 --> 48:59.603
Thanks.

49:00.312 --> 49:02.481
It's probably
'cause it's my full-time job now.

49:03.231 --> 49:04.107
Wait, what?

49:05.233 --> 49:07.110
-This is good, right?
-Oh, yeah.

49:10.364 --> 49:12.157
Chug-a-lug, ladies, we're on the move.

49:12.282 --> 49:15.619
Oh, no, ladies. That is a select Cabernet,
meant to be savored...

49:15.702 --> 49:18.413
Yeah, well, we can get this stuff online.
Let's hit the van.

49:20.165 --> 49:23.835
-Jeez, this is a real go-go-go kinda trip.
-Keep up, 50.

49:24.252 --> 49:26.296
My soul age is 28.

49:26.588 --> 49:29.424
I'd love to get your names and socials
for our wine club.

49:30.217 --> 49:32.386
Okay, guys, next stop is biking
and shopping...

49:32.469 --> 49:33.929
-Yes!
-...and we're gonna get all of our stuff

49:34.012 --> 49:36.223
in Napa so we don't have to get anything
at the airport.

49:36.306 --> 49:39.643
-I'm gonna buy a really big hat.
-Naomi, you're up, what's your DUI song?

49:40.352 --> 49:44.398
My song is gonna be,
"Poison, Po-po-po, Poison."

50:03.792 --> 50:04.668
Pizza.

50:12.217 --> 50:13.135
Oh, my gosh.

50:15.220 --> 50:17.639
I just spent $750.

50:19.558 --> 50:23.687
Not only is Morgan Jorng Winery solar,
it is also...

50:25.397 --> 50:26.231
organic!

50:26.481 --> 50:28.942
So no sulfates, no pesticides,

50:29.026 --> 50:31.987
and the beautiful sun powering us all.

50:32.904 --> 50:34.823
You'll notice, because it's organic,

50:34.906 --> 50:37.409
there's a lot of sediment
at the bottom of your glass.

50:37.492 --> 50:40.287
-I was wondering what that was.
-Does anybody know the term for that?

50:41.121 --> 50:43.373
For the sediment
at the bottom of the glass.

50:44.666 --> 50:46.418
-You can just tell us.
-Sediment?

50:46.543 --> 50:48.503
-Gravel?
-Mud?

50:49.838 --> 50:52.174
-Shavings?
-Wine waste?

50:52.466 --> 50:54.926
-Minerality?
-I'll just go ahead and answer this one.

50:55.010 --> 50:57.554
-Tartrates.
-Tartrates.

50:57.804 --> 50:59.890
You know what I also like to call it,
though?

50:59.973 --> 51:01.016
Wine diamonds.

51:02.017 --> 51:04.561
Jeez, people really like to talk
about wine around here.

51:04.644 --> 51:05.562
Well, yeah.

51:06.688 --> 51:07.564
It's Napa.

51:10.484 --> 51:12.444
Right? Why you came here.

51:12.527 --> 51:15.739
-Can we... get to the...
-Sure, get to the solar questions?

51:15.822 --> 51:16.948
No, speed this up.

51:17.032 --> 51:22.496
Okay, so, how much energy do you think
that our solar panels create here?

51:22.788 --> 51:24.414
-How much energy?
-I don't know.

51:25.165 --> 51:26.458
Ten kilowatts?

51:26.708 --> 51:27.834
Fifty thousand.

51:28.710 --> 51:29.878
-Right.
-I was way off.

51:29.961 --> 51:31.797
You know what I really like
that we do here?

51:31.880 --> 51:34.216
Notice how our wines are not on ice?

51:34.299 --> 51:35.342
What are they on?

51:35.675 --> 51:38.428
-Soil?
-Soil. Exactly. I...

51:38.512 --> 51:40.847
-We're gonna stroll around for a second.
-Oh, okay.

51:41.223 --> 51:44.267
So, just one rule today:
no walking in the vineyards.

51:45.102 --> 51:45.936
Okay?

51:46.853 --> 51:47.771
And have fun.

51:48.438 --> 51:49.689
Can I just say something?

51:49.773 --> 51:52.901
I'm tired of Naomi shaming me
for working all the time.

51:53.026 --> 51:56.404
You know what I mean? It's like, we work.
It's who we are, it's what we do.

51:57.531 --> 52:01.118
Well, I hope I'm more than my work,
or else, fuck.

52:01.201 --> 52:02.244
Come on, yeah.

52:02.327 --> 52:04.496
Okay, let's play "path not taken."

52:05.372 --> 52:07.833
I would work at a bookstore,
like a crunchy bookstore

52:07.916 --> 52:11.128
in Portland or Seattle,
somewhere rainy and moody.

52:11.211 --> 52:12.420
-I love it.
-Right?

52:12.504 --> 52:13.713
-That's so good.
-You go.

52:13.797 --> 52:16.216
Okay, path not taken. Zamboni driver.

52:16.591 --> 52:19.386
I swear to God. It would be so peaceful.

52:19.469 --> 52:21.138
Clean slate every two hours.

52:21.221 --> 52:23.348
Start over, nice and simple.

52:23.431 --> 52:25.976
Really cold, no hot flashes. Come on.

52:26.476 --> 52:28.645
I think I would also be good
at close-up magic.

52:28.728 --> 52:30.480
-You would.
-Thank you.

52:30.564 --> 52:33.233
-Oh, my God, that's such a good one.
-Yeah. I could...

52:33.483 --> 52:35.110
-maintain fierce eye contact...
-Yes.

52:35.193 --> 52:36.987
-...while stealing someone's wallet.
-I love it.

52:37.070 --> 52:38.655
Can I just say something?

52:39.030 --> 52:41.074
Why is Naomi treating this trip like...

52:41.158 --> 52:43.160
we're all gonna die immediately after?

52:43.743 --> 52:45.453
She loves us so much.

52:45.954 --> 52:47.539
But, yeah, it's a little manic.

52:48.540 --> 52:50.083
Is there scarecrows out here?

52:50.250 --> 52:53.044
'Cause if I see a scarecrow,
I'm gonna fucking shit my pants.

52:54.880 --> 52:58.008
Remember when you shit your pants
in Yankee Candle Company?

52:58.091 --> 53:01.636
Yes. Because whenever I sniff candles,
I always have to poop.

53:01.928 --> 53:05.599
Yeah, but you're around candles,
so it covers up the smell. That's good.

53:05.682 --> 53:08.643
I know, but then, it's a vicious cycle.

53:09.603 --> 53:11.062
<i>Can I just say something?</i>

53:11.271 --> 53:13.982
I got my bikini area lasered,

53:14.065 --> 53:18.069
and now I'm like, "Oh, great.
What's it gonna look like when I'm 70?"

53:18.153 --> 53:19.738
Is it going to be like a...

53:20.697 --> 53:22.324
gray-haired goatee?

53:22.449 --> 53:25.535
-You got too much off?
-Yes. It's like...

53:25.702 --> 53:27.829
It's like pencil-thin, I blew it.

53:27.913 --> 53:30.999
-I'm gonna need that hair down there--
-You don't know.

53:31.124 --> 53:34.586
Maybe it'll be a cute little
Colonel Sanders chin going on down there.

53:35.045 --> 53:39.090
That's what I want,
a cute Colonel Sanders chin.

53:39.174 --> 53:42.844
"Honey, are you looking forward
to seeing Colonel Sanders tonight?"

53:43.345 --> 53:44.179
Oh, boy.

53:44.554 --> 53:46.932
Maybe it's like a...
you know, it's like a...

53:47.641 --> 53:50.602
like a Dizzy Gillespie,
like a jazz musician...

53:50.685 --> 53:51.895
-Oh, right.
-...beav.

53:52.145 --> 53:53.980
-I think he'd love that.
-What about a little Ted Nugent?

53:54.064 --> 53:55.607
No, wait, I shouldn't have said that.

53:55.690 --> 53:57.817
-Fuck that guy.
-No. No Ted Nugent. Sorry.

53:57.901 --> 54:00.111
Like a Billy Bob Thornton,
that's what you were thinking.

54:00.195 --> 54:01.238
Sure, Billy Bob Thornton.

54:01.321 --> 54:03.782
"Hey, honey, you want
some french fried potatoes?"

54:07.077 --> 54:10.163
Oh, God! Full-on mud in this bottle.

54:10.705 --> 54:12.415
God, fuck this organic shit.

54:12.749 --> 54:13.792
Well, you better drink up,

54:13.875 --> 54:16.753
'cause Abby's gonna come through
with the Abby alarm any minute now.

54:16.836 --> 54:18.588
-Oh, my God.
-Can I just say something?

54:18.672 --> 54:20.882
-She needs to ease up.
-Yes.

54:21.424 --> 54:23.009
-It's insane.
-Hi!

54:23.635 --> 54:26.972
This is an organic winery,
so we can't have you walking in there.

54:27.055 --> 54:29.057
-Oh.
-Yeah, I think we put up signs.

54:30.141 --> 54:30.976
Right there.

54:31.726 --> 54:33.478
So, yeah, can't walk through there.

54:33.728 --> 54:36.064
-Sorry.
-Okay, you can follow me out.

54:36.189 --> 54:38.316
-Okay, sorry about that.
-Okay.

54:38.942 --> 54:40.819
-Sorry, not sorry.
-Right?

54:40.902 --> 54:43.697
-The sign is facing the other way.
-Hey, guess what? Passive-aggressive.

54:43.780 --> 54:47.158
-That wasn't passive. That was aggressive.
-Guess what, also?

54:47.450 --> 54:49.119
-My shoes are clean.
-Yeah.

54:49.244 --> 54:51.997
Hey, you don't know me.
You don't know my shoes.

54:52.080 --> 54:54.582
-You don't...
-You don't know my shoes, bitch!

54:54.666 --> 54:56.001
You don't know my shoes!

54:56.084 --> 54:58.128
Guess what? These are fucking clean.

54:58.211 --> 55:00.338
Can you just follow me out? Yeah.
Keep coming.

55:00.422 --> 55:02.590
-Okay, no problem.
-Okay, sorry about that.

55:09.139 --> 55:11.599
<i>-Happy birthday, babe.</i>
-Technically tomorrow.

55:11.683 --> 55:13.351
-He knows that.
<i>-But I can't call tomorrow</i>

55:13.435 --> 55:16.187
<i>-'cause I'll be out on the pontoon boat.</i>
-Holy shit.

55:17.605 --> 55:19.399
Have they been here this whole time?

55:23.194 --> 55:24.070
Hey.

55:30.201 --> 55:31.911
I know, guys.

55:32.037 --> 55:34.581
You were thinking something else, right?

55:34.831 --> 55:36.458
Well, guess what, I'm here.

55:38.501 --> 55:42.756
Funny story,
I had some wine diamonds today,

55:43.131 --> 55:44.758
and I don't feel so good.

55:45.133 --> 55:47.719
Oh, my God. Naomi is loaded.

55:47.927 --> 55:50.597
You know, I wanna sing a little ditty

55:50.680 --> 55:54.351
for my sweet, very short friend Rebecca

55:54.434 --> 55:58.271
who is turning 22 tomorrow.

55:58.355 --> 55:59.397
Wink, wink.

56:01.066 --> 56:02.317
She's not.

56:03.234 --> 56:04.277
You know...

56:04.903 --> 56:06.029
birthdays are a funny thing,

56:06.112 --> 56:08.698
'cause, like, some people hate 'em,
and some people love 'em.

56:08.782 --> 56:10.450
I love my birthday, I'm a Leo.

56:10.742 --> 56:15.413
But, Rebecca, you got it going on, girl.

56:17.916 --> 56:19.584
Don't get it twisted.

56:20.085 --> 56:22.128
You deserve the world.

56:22.837 --> 56:24.839
And since I can't give you diamonds

56:25.256 --> 56:26.716
and I can't give you pearls,

56:26.800 --> 56:30.387
I'm gonna give you something
you ain't never had before.

56:31.054 --> 56:33.848
I'm gonna give you a song from the heart.

56:34.516 --> 56:35.934
You guys,

56:36.476 --> 56:38.019
our dear, sweet...

56:39.145 --> 56:41.272
Rebecca Sue is all grown up.

56:42.148 --> 56:45.276
I want to dedicate this song

56:46.236 --> 56:48.363
to my beautiful friend Rebecca.

56:49.155 --> 56:50.990
This is for you, honey tits.

56:51.699 --> 56:53.368
Hit it, boys.

56:53.868 --> 56:55.328
What would you like us to play?

56:56.037 --> 56:57.163
"Eternal Flame."

56:57.247 --> 56:58.790
-Okay.
-Yes.

57:05.422 --> 57:06.881
<i>Close your eyes</i>

57:08.174 --> 57:09.092
Oh, my God.

57:09.592 --> 57:10.635
Naomi?

57:12.011 --> 57:12.846
I'm cool.

57:13.346 --> 57:14.347
Yeah!

57:15.223 --> 57:16.224
You're a pro.

57:16.307 --> 57:17.308
<i>Darling</i>

57:17.767 --> 57:21.312
<i>Do you feel my heart beating?</i>

57:21.604 --> 57:26.901
<i>Do you understand?</i>

57:30.238 --> 57:31.364
I'm sensing a lull.

57:31.448 --> 57:33.491
So my vote is for literally anything
by Sublime.

57:33.575 --> 57:34.659
Absolutely not, Devon.

57:35.160 --> 57:37.036
-Chilis?
-Devon, no.

57:37.162 --> 57:38.830
-Bush?
-Now I'm getting upset.

57:38.913 --> 57:41.416
Oh, my God. "Everything Zen."
That changed my life.

57:41.749 --> 57:42.959
-Third Eye Blind?
-No.

57:43.042 --> 57:44.294
-311?
-No.

57:44.377 --> 57:47.922
Okay, guys! I got the T-shirts
for the drone shot.

57:48.673 --> 57:49.966
Did you say "drone shot"?

57:50.049 --> 57:52.427
Oh, yeah, the drone shot.
It's in the itinerary.

57:52.510 --> 57:55.054
Yes, I said "drone." On the itinerary.

57:55.430 --> 57:57.640
-I don't think my shirt's gonna fit.
-It is. It will.

57:57.724 --> 57:59.142
Okay, follow me, guys. Let's go.

57:59.225 --> 58:01.102
Can we stay here a little bit?
It's so nice.

58:01.186 --> 58:03.480
We're gonna go through the wine tunnels
and take the drone shot.

58:04.481 --> 58:05.940
Holy cannoli.

58:06.024 --> 58:08.693
These weird wine caves
would be a good place to try molly.

58:08.776 --> 58:11.946
Maybe we'll do the molly after we get
the drone shot. That'll be more fun.

58:12.030 --> 58:14.949
Wait, I have a few more questions.
Is molly what that kid did

58:15.033 --> 58:17.243
when he ate that guy's face
in his dad's garage?

58:17.327 --> 58:19.370
-No, I don't think so.
-Is that the one that keeps you up?

58:19.454 --> 58:21.206
Because when I need to sleep,
I need to sleep.

58:21.289 --> 58:23.750
Come on, people, let's just try it.
What are we, a bunch of nerds?

58:23.833 --> 58:26.544
-Yes.
-Okay, if we want to do the molly,

58:26.628 --> 58:28.671
maybe we can do it
after horseback riding tomorrow.

58:29.297 --> 58:33.009
-I vote "no" on the horseback riding.
-Wait, here's what I don't get.

58:33.092 --> 58:35.428
If we were to do the molly,
how long does it stay in your body?

58:35.512 --> 58:37.639
Like, what is the duration of the "trip"?

58:38.264 --> 58:40.141
Oh, my God, with the quotes.

58:40.225 --> 58:42.393
Whatever we do,
we have to harmonize in here

58:42.477 --> 58:44.729
-'cause the acoustics are the shit.
-Oh, yes.

58:54.364 --> 58:56.616
Hey, guys? Can we put our T-shirts on,

58:56.866 --> 59:00.078
so we can get to the pavilion
and take a super fun drone shot?

59:03.414 --> 59:06.960
You guys, I'm gonna go follow her,
and I'm gonna offer her some feedback.

59:07.460 --> 59:09.796
-I actually think that's a terrible idea.
-I wouldn't do that.

59:09.879 --> 59:11.881
-Please don't.
-This is what I do.

59:12.632 --> 59:13.508
Where is she?

59:14.842 --> 59:17.303
Yeah, how does she know her way
around these tunnels?

59:18.012 --> 59:20.723
<i>-Where'd she go?</i>
<i>-Where'd she go?</i>

59:20.807 --> 59:23.518
<i>-Where'd she go?</i>
<i>-Where'd she go?</i>

59:24.227 --> 59:27.605
<i>Where did she go?</i>

59:29.941 --> 59:31.359
Seriously, where did she go?

59:32.110 --> 59:34.904
-Are we lost?
-We've gotta find her.

01:00:01.014 --> 01:00:02.015
Hey, Abby?

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:04.642
The girls urged me
not to offer you any feedback,

01:00:04.726 --> 01:00:06.603
but I'm just gonna go with my gut here.

01:00:06.686 --> 01:00:08.271
May I offer you some feedback?

01:00:08.479 --> 01:00:09.522
Oh, boy.

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:13.526
I feel like the universe
is gently nudging you to chill.

01:00:14.152 --> 01:00:15.945
Well, tell the universe that I'm chilling

01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:18.364
and I'm also looking for the drone.
Do you see it?

01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:20.575
Okay, just, the schedule you have us on,

01:00:20.658 --> 01:00:23.036
I feel like it's keeping <i>you</i>
from having fun.<i> </i> Like,

01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:26.623
if you were just to let go,
everything will just fall into place.

01:00:27.915 --> 01:00:29.208
Will it fall into place?

01:00:30.001 --> 01:00:32.170
Will it, Rebecca? Will it fall into place?

01:00:32.670 --> 01:00:34.589
Will someone else take care of me?

01:00:34.714 --> 01:00:36.758
Or will I always have to do
everything myself?

01:00:37.717 --> 01:00:39.052
Let me know when it falls into place,

01:00:39.135 --> 01:00:42.013
'cause last time I checked,
this world's pretty fucking selfish.

01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:43.640
Okay. Deep breath.

01:00:43.723 --> 01:00:46.559
No, let's take some inventory
about how everything's falling into place.

01:00:46.643 --> 01:00:49.062
How about my marriage?
Did that fall into place?

01:00:49.145 --> 01:00:51.230
What about this text from that girl
that's gonna hurt you?

01:00:51.314 --> 01:00:52.398
That falling into place?

01:00:53.566 --> 01:00:56.361
Your obvious midlife crisis.
Is that falling into place?

01:00:57.195 --> 01:01:00.114
Your inability to cope
with almost everything?

01:01:00.198 --> 01:01:02.283
-Is that falling into place for you?
-No.

01:01:02.742 --> 01:01:05.161
-Your husband? Is that falling into place?
-What?

01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:07.664
Maybe you should take a good hard look
at yourself in the mirror.

01:01:07.747 --> 01:01:09.248
Maybe the therapist should go to therapy.

01:01:13.252 --> 01:01:15.046
Am I not getting a falling into place?

01:01:15.296 --> 01:01:16.964
Jeez, Catherine, enough.

01:01:17.048 --> 01:01:20.093
The whole "left out" thing
is really getting old.

01:01:20.176 --> 01:01:23.054
You're the one who's always running away
from us every time you get a call.

01:01:23.137 --> 01:01:25.348
-I have work.
-I'm sorry, let's not fight.

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:27.892
This time together
is supposed to be special.

01:01:27.975 --> 01:01:30.687
Oh, my God, Naomi, we're not fighting,
we're just talking.

01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:33.856
-That's what life is.
-Well, it's very negative.

01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:36.025
Yeah, well, life is negative.
That's what Brené Brown said.

01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:38.111
That's exactly what she did <i>not </i> say.

01:01:38.403 --> 01:01:40.363
Abby, what is negative in your life
right now?

01:01:40.446 --> 01:01:42.615
You've got amazing friends,
you got a great career--

01:01:42.699 --> 01:01:43.991
No, I don't.

01:01:44.325 --> 01:01:45.785
Okay? I lost my job.

01:01:46.828 --> 01:01:49.706
All right? And it's really stupid
to even cry about it.

01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:55.586
Shit, I mean, people are starving
in the world, and there's earthquakes.

01:01:56.087 --> 01:02:00.007
And people are shooting at each other,
and I'm crying about my stupid poor job.

01:02:00.258 --> 01:02:03.177
Abby, honey. That doesn't mean
your feelings aren't valid.

01:02:03.261 --> 01:02:05.346
That's exactly what white privilege is!

01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:07.682
Plus, what are we doing
to the environment?

01:02:07.765 --> 01:02:09.767
I mean, we can't--
There's no fish anymore!

01:02:09.851 --> 01:02:10.768
All the plastic is...

01:02:12.061 --> 01:02:13.438
filling up in the ocean.

01:02:13.855 --> 01:02:17.483
And... there's like one rhinoceros left!

01:02:19.235 --> 01:02:20.528
What the fuck?

01:02:24.657 --> 01:02:26.200
Why wouldn't she tell us that?

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:31.122
Some things are too scary to say.

01:02:31.205 --> 01:02:32.415
Not to us.

01:02:34.292 --> 01:02:35.752
You guys don't like Brian?

01:02:36.043 --> 01:02:38.921
-Oh, my God, we love Brian.
-Brian, he's the best.

01:02:39.005 --> 01:02:40.757
-He's a character.
-He's so cool.

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:42.425
-Fucking prince.
-Awesome.

01:02:48.598 --> 01:02:49.640
Where to?

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:53.603
Well, Abby, what's on the itinerary?

01:02:53.686 --> 01:02:56.314
You know what? Don't look at that.
It doesn't matter. It's stupid.

01:03:01.527 --> 01:03:05.156
Do you think throwing the itineraries
out the window was on the itinerary?

01:03:05.239 --> 01:03:06.532
Guess we'll never know.

01:03:06.824 --> 01:03:09.494
Guys, left or right?
I gotta make a decision.

01:03:11.746 --> 01:03:13.706
Oh, my God, she texted.

01:03:14.332 --> 01:03:15.792
Jade just texted back.

01:03:16.584 --> 01:03:19.003
She wants us to come over to her art show.

01:03:21.130 --> 01:03:22.006
I told you.

01:03:22.089 --> 01:03:25.259
-I mean, I knew that she would text.
-Okay, let's go there, then.

01:03:25.343 --> 01:03:27.553
Let's go to the art show, right?
That'll be perfect.

01:03:27.637 --> 01:03:28.888
Let's pick a DUI song!

01:03:30.223 --> 01:03:31.057
Anybody?

01:03:31.682 --> 01:03:33.434
-Abby?
-Silence is good for now.

01:03:52.453 --> 01:03:54.080
This is a major fuck-up.

01:03:54.205 --> 01:03:55.706
Abby's gonna hate this.

01:03:56.415 --> 01:03:59.293
This wall of shoe boxes
should really snap her out of her mood.

01:04:08.970 --> 01:04:10.304
I'll tell you the answer.

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:12.265
"No" and "No, you're not."

01:04:13.641 --> 01:04:15.476
Abby, I know you don't want
to talk about it,

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:18.396
-but I'm really sorry about your job.
-Well, thanks.

01:04:18.813 --> 01:04:21.399
The one time I can't figure out
how to get on Snapchat.

01:04:21.482 --> 01:04:22.358
One time.

01:04:22.859 --> 01:04:23.985
And everybody saw.

01:04:27.238 --> 01:04:28.614
Young people blow.

01:04:33.619 --> 01:04:35.663
Isn't Jade so ungodly cute?

01:04:39.417 --> 01:04:42.670
Okay, guys,
I'm gonna just say a couple words.

01:04:44.755 --> 01:04:45.965
Yeah, so...

01:04:46.215 --> 01:04:48.551
Art has been my <i>raison d'être</i>

01:04:48.634 --> 01:04:51.804
since... literally my first moment
of consciousness.

01:04:52.638 --> 01:04:58.019
I... can't believe I'm following
in the footsteps of my heroes.

01:04:58.185 --> 01:05:01.606
O'Keeffe, Kahlo, Warhol, Basquiat,

01:05:01.814 --> 01:05:03.608
with my very own show.

01:05:04.442 --> 01:05:07.320
So, thank you. I'm humbled.

01:05:08.404 --> 01:05:09.238
Clearly.

01:05:10.239 --> 01:05:12.658
Thank you for coming in, too...
like, from the city,

01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:14.535
with the caravans and all of you,

01:05:14.619 --> 01:05:17.997
it's... fucking so touching.
So, thank you.

01:05:19.582 --> 01:05:21.542
So, yeah. Let me get on with it.

01:05:21.834 --> 01:05:25.129
<i>The Nanny</i> was more than a sitcom.

01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:29.216
Okay, it was a post-modern psychodrama

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:32.345
about classism and ambition in the 1990s.

01:05:33.137 --> 01:05:36.974
You know, Fran Drescher's Fran Fine
was an icon.

01:05:37.099 --> 01:05:40.394
Honestly, I mean, a cultural touchstone.

01:05:42.021 --> 01:05:45.066
God. All her art is Fran Drescher.

01:05:46.442 --> 01:05:47.276
Why?

01:05:47.568 --> 01:05:51.572
Yeah, so yeah, I'd like to just open up
for some questions or comments.

01:05:51.656 --> 01:05:52.490
Yeah?

01:05:52.573 --> 01:05:56.827
It's so contextual, but at the same time,
wholly independent.

01:05:57.244 --> 01:05:58.704
Did you do that consciously?

01:05:58.788 --> 01:06:00.748
You know what? I did, yeah.

01:06:01.123 --> 01:06:04.168
It's really a <i> lettera d'amore</i>
to <i>The Nanny.</i>

01:06:04.251 --> 01:06:07.838
But, more importantly, it's a reaction
to all of our experiences

01:06:07.922 --> 01:06:10.716
-surrounding <i>The Nanny.</i>
-I never saw <i>The Nanny,</i>

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:14.095
but I don't want that to stop me
from participating in this conversation.

01:06:14.178 --> 01:06:15.054
It shouldn't.

01:06:15.638 --> 01:06:18.891
This piece. Am I supposed to feel scared?

01:06:18.975 --> 01:06:21.686
Yes. I am so glad you got that vibe.

01:06:21.769 --> 01:06:25.064
-Also offended. Yeah?
-Very. Thank you.

01:06:25.189 --> 01:06:27.316
Have you considered doing
any other sitcom art?

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:30.236
-Like, is <i>ALF </i> an option?
-That's a good question.

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:32.947
I think I'm focusing more on women
right now.

01:06:33.030 --> 01:06:36.367
'Cause, I don't know,
I feel like time is up on <i>ALF, </i> right?

01:06:36.450 --> 01:06:37.910
I have a question.

01:06:38.285 --> 01:06:41.497
Do any of you watch TV?
Like, is TV still a thing?

01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:43.874
Like, do you watch
those judging competition shows?

01:06:44.083 --> 01:06:45.751
I've only seen TV in the movies.

01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:48.963
I knew I was right.
Dammit, gotta call my agent.

01:06:50.381 --> 01:06:53.300
Adrian, comma, confirming I was correct

01:06:53.467 --> 01:06:57.138
re, colon, streaming V, period, broadcast.

01:06:57.346 --> 01:06:59.181
Shit, I don't have a signal.
I gotta go outside.

01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:04.186
Yeah, my oldest kid is 15,
and on the verge of becoming...

01:07:05.062 --> 01:07:06.063
this.

01:07:06.147 --> 01:07:10.067
I just wanna know, how do I stop her
from becoming an asshole?

01:07:10.818 --> 01:07:12.653
I feel like I'm about to take umbrage.

01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:14.196
Are you okay?

01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:16.032
And you know what else worries me?

01:07:16.115 --> 01:07:18.284
It is way too easy for you guys
to get porn.

01:07:18.659 --> 01:07:19.493
Oh, my God.

01:07:19.702 --> 01:07:22.496
I used to drive miles
in the middle of the night

01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:25.124
just to go to this little newsstand
by the bus station

01:07:25.207 --> 01:07:26.959
just to find lesbo porn.

01:07:27.376 --> 01:07:29.879
You guys have it so lucky
on the porn front.

01:07:30.337 --> 01:07:33.591
I hadn't thought about it
that way before. It's so interesting.

01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:36.594
No wonder they're so scared of sexuality.

01:07:36.969 --> 01:07:38.846
They associate it with hard work and fear.

01:07:39.138 --> 01:07:40.973
And driving long distances.

01:07:41.307 --> 01:07:43.017
I can't with the confidence
in these people.

01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:43.934
Wait.

01:07:44.018 --> 01:07:46.729
So we're putting 'em down
because they have healthy self-esteem?

01:07:46.937 --> 01:07:49.315
I've spent my whole life thinking I suck.

01:07:49.774 --> 01:07:51.650
You know what happened
at my first poetry reading?

01:07:51.734 --> 01:07:52.902
I completely bombed.

01:07:52.985 --> 01:07:56.197
No claps. No snaps. Just total silence.

01:07:56.405 --> 01:07:58.449
Till, finally, this one dude,
way in the back,

01:07:58.532 --> 01:08:01.660
he just turned to his girlfriend
and he went, "Oof."

01:08:02.495 --> 01:08:04.872
But you know what?
That was an important "oof,"

01:08:05.206 --> 01:08:08.334
because it confirmed to me
that I'm a complete piece of shit.

01:08:08.459 --> 01:08:10.544
And that's what made me the writer
I am today.

01:08:10.628 --> 01:08:12.463
I thank God for that "oof."

01:08:13.297 --> 01:08:15.633
-This girl needs an "oof."
-Oof.

01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:19.303
Jade, we're not trying to hurt
anyone's feelings.

01:08:19.386 --> 01:08:21.180
My God, they were born with hurt feelings.

01:08:21.514 --> 01:08:25.017
Why don't you not blast your feelings
all over your best friend, the internet?

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:26.810
Please,
their parents are their best friends.

01:08:27.144 --> 01:08:28.145
Well, that I do like.

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:30.689
You know who my best friend is?
My best friend.

01:08:30.814 --> 01:08:33.692
These women, right here,
who I've known for 20-plus years.

01:08:33.776 --> 01:08:36.862
And yeah, sure, sometimes I want
to tell this one to fuck off.

01:08:36.946 --> 01:08:38.656
That's what intimacy looks like.

01:08:38.738 --> 01:08:40.491
-You want me to fuck off?
-What?

01:08:40.573 --> 01:08:42.993
If you all are friends,
why are you so mad at each other?

01:08:43.077 --> 01:08:44.286
We're not mad.

01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:46.538
-Crazy, mad, grouchy. Look at this one.
-Fascinating.

01:08:46.997 --> 01:08:48.707
We're not grouchy.

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:50.209
Guys, please forgive us.

01:08:50.542 --> 01:08:52.044
We've been drinking wine all day,

01:08:52.127 --> 01:08:54.421
and we're just not right in our heads
right now.

01:08:54.505 --> 01:09:00.719
We are exactly where we need to be.
We're doing <i>fine. Fran Fine.</i>

01:09:03.471 --> 01:09:04.890
That's brilliant. Did you see that?

01:09:04.974 --> 01:09:06.392
Is this part of the show?

01:09:07.393 --> 01:09:09.937
That was... incredible.

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:12.606
You are amazing. Moms, you're amazing.

01:09:15.192 --> 01:09:18.696
Context within context,
that's exactly what we're talking about.

01:09:35.254 --> 01:09:37.131
Excuse me. Do you have Wi-Fi in here?

01:09:37.673 --> 01:09:39.175
And then there was one.

01:09:40.091 --> 01:09:41.301
Tammy, hi.

01:09:41.844 --> 01:09:44.513
I'm just trying to get a little work done
while the girls are at this art show.

01:09:44.596 --> 01:09:45.680
-Art show?
-Yeah.

01:09:45.764 --> 01:09:47.808
Oof, things must have gone
really sideways.

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:49.518
-Yeah.
-Give me your phone.

01:09:49.602 --> 01:09:52.104
-I'll get you online.
-Oh, my God, awesome. Thank you.

01:09:52.395 --> 01:09:55.816
Pedro,
is the password still "penisgrigio72"?

01:09:58.736 --> 01:10:01.322
Thank you.
We need a couple of beers here also.

01:10:02.114 --> 01:10:02.948
Cool.

01:10:03.824 --> 01:10:05.117
Are you guys good pals?

01:10:06.243 --> 01:10:07.411
We are acquaintances.

01:10:10.372 --> 01:10:12.750
Do you ever get lonely up here,
living by yourself?

01:10:14.251 --> 01:10:16.962
No, I love it. Loneliness is for suckers.

01:10:17.338 --> 01:10:19.256
'Cause you know who I can trust? Me.

01:10:19.632 --> 01:10:22.384
You know who's never gonna bail on me?
Me.

01:10:23.010 --> 01:10:24.345
Anyway, get your shit done,

01:10:24.428 --> 01:10:26.680
bring people joy
with that fantastic pizza.

01:10:26.889 --> 01:10:28.641
I'll be over here hitting bull's-eyes.

01:10:31.936 --> 01:10:34.313
-Can I ask your advice on something?
-Shoot.

01:10:35.397 --> 01:10:37.942
-I'm being offered this TV show.
-No, shoot the dart.

01:10:38.150 --> 01:10:41.403
I'm uncomfortable in any one-on-one
situation unless I can win.

01:10:43.322 --> 01:10:45.407
Sure. Right, okay.

01:10:46.450 --> 01:10:47.952
Thanks, Val.

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:50.871
Do you think you can carry this one
over, too?

01:10:50.955 --> 01:10:51.956
You got it.

01:10:52.039 --> 01:10:54.416
Okay, just be very careful.

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:55.584
-Oh, of course.
-Okay.

01:10:56.502 --> 01:10:58.963
Oh, that smile is so infectious.

01:10:59.129 --> 01:11:01.131
I know, it's so ironic, right?

01:11:04.927 --> 01:11:06.262
Sorry about my friends.

01:11:06.762 --> 01:11:08.764
Oh, no! I love them.

01:11:09.473 --> 01:11:12.434
People are really liking my show!

01:11:13.602 --> 01:11:15.938
Do you think you guys could come back
and do that whole,

01:11:16.021 --> 01:11:17.982
"I'm mad at young people" thing again?

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:19.441
I can ask.

01:11:19.525 --> 01:11:22.444
But to be clear,
we're not mad at young people.

01:11:23.153 --> 01:11:24.738
Or I'd be mad at myself, right?

01:11:27.616 --> 01:11:29.118
You're so funny, Val.

01:11:30.035 --> 01:11:31.203
I'm happy we met.

01:11:31.745 --> 01:11:32.579
Me, too.

01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:35.666
I like you.

01:11:39.378 --> 01:11:40.337
I like you, too.

01:11:47.344 --> 01:11:48.804
Can I ask you something?

01:11:55.644 --> 01:11:57.146
I think I know what it is.

01:12:03.193 --> 01:12:05.863
I usually charge 800, but...

01:12:06.405 --> 01:12:08.282
I'm gonna give it to you for 600.

01:12:15.289 --> 01:12:16.665
Talking about the painting?

01:12:21.462 --> 01:12:22.296
That's great.

01:12:23.839 --> 01:12:25.924
'Cause I love your art so much.

01:12:26.216 --> 01:12:28.719
-It's gonna look great.
-I can't wait to hang it.

01:12:28.802 --> 01:12:29.678
So happy.

01:12:34.224 --> 01:12:38.312
As a business owner, you can't join in
in the same way.

01:12:39.438 --> 01:12:42.358
You know, you can't worry
about if people like you or not.

01:12:43.942 --> 01:12:44.985
Yeah, I mean, I...

01:12:46.028 --> 01:12:46.945
Shit.

01:12:47.446 --> 01:12:49.448
I get that with my employees,

01:12:49.531 --> 01:12:51.700
but we're talking about my oldest friends.

01:12:51.784 --> 01:12:54.828
I mean, of course I'm gonna be worried
about what they think.

01:12:54.912 --> 01:12:58.123
-That's where you're fucking up.
-Why?

01:12:58.874 --> 01:13:02.628
Because I don't think your friends
even invited you on this trip.

01:13:02.961 --> 01:13:04.254
Did Abby tell you that?

01:13:04.421 --> 01:13:06.298
Did she say five people were coming?

01:13:06.423 --> 01:13:07.257
What? No.

01:13:07.549 --> 01:13:10.302
Well, I'm saying work is a big part
of who you are.

01:13:10.469 --> 01:13:12.846
So if they don't let you talk about work,

01:13:12.930 --> 01:13:15.391
then they're not letting you be
on this trip.

01:13:15.474 --> 01:13:17.518
Yeah, okay. Can I just say something?

01:13:17.601 --> 01:13:19.353
No. Remember what I said?

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:21.605
About the phrase
"Can I just say something?"

01:13:21.688 --> 01:13:23.857
-Just walk away from that phrase.
-Fuck, right.

01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:28.821
When I was a kid,

01:13:30.322 --> 01:13:31.698
I was always alone, you know?

01:13:31.907 --> 01:13:35.786
My mom was a single, working mother,
that whole deal, right?

01:13:36.328 --> 01:13:39.206
And it really wasn't
until I met these girls that I...

01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:41.708
experienced family.

01:13:42.709 --> 01:13:43.836
That's powerful.

01:13:44.461 --> 01:13:45.838
Friendship is powerful.

01:13:49.425 --> 01:13:50.717
You gotta do that show.

01:13:51.552 --> 01:13:54.888
Stay busy, pizza for one.
Be honest with yourself,

01:13:54.972 --> 01:13:57.975
work is your best friend.
And you gotta get contestants on that show

01:13:58.058 --> 01:14:00.769
that are kids,
because I love watching kids with knives.

01:14:04.231 --> 01:14:05.149
Yeah.

01:14:15.325 --> 01:14:17.035
This weekend is a mess.

01:14:18.328 --> 01:14:20.664
I can't even plan a fun birthday trip.

01:14:21.915 --> 01:14:24.126
Can I quote one
of my favorite song lyrics?

01:14:24.793 --> 01:14:27.045
"Self-doubt is self-worth

01:14:27.129 --> 01:14:28.505
in another universe."

01:14:31.133 --> 01:14:32.134
What song is that?

01:14:32.801 --> 01:14:33.635
My own.

01:14:35.095 --> 01:14:35.971
Of course.

01:14:37.931 --> 01:14:39.349
Is the paella ready yet?

01:14:39.433 --> 01:14:41.518
Just about,
maybe another four hours or so.

01:14:41.602 --> 01:14:42.561
Oh, Jesus.

01:14:42.644 --> 01:14:46.106
-How are you gonna get that thing home?
-I don't know. I'll fucking fold it.

01:14:46.648 --> 01:14:47.483
You know what?

01:14:49.026 --> 01:14:51.236
Today was <i>not </i> an amazing day
in wine country.

01:14:52.738 --> 01:14:53.739
So, suck on that.

01:14:59.369 --> 01:15:03.290
<i>-So how is it? Are you having fun?</i>
-This trip is three nights too long.

01:15:04.082 --> 01:15:07.211
<i>But the trip is only three nights.</i>
<i>Oh. I get it.</i>

01:15:09.463 --> 01:15:10.631
I wish I was there.

01:15:11.715 --> 01:15:13.967
<i>Hello, this is Olivia</i>
<i>from Dr. Melton's office</i>

01:15:14.051 --> 01:15:16.845
<i>calling to let you know that the results</i>
<i>from your blood work are in.</i>

01:15:16.929 --> 01:15:19.681
<i>If you could please give us a call back</i>
<i>at your earliest convenience...</i>

01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:57.636
Fuck!

01:15:59.388 --> 01:16:00.430
Oh, my God.

01:16:00.639 --> 01:16:02.099
Oh, my back!

01:16:05.269 --> 01:16:06.103
My back!

01:16:10.023 --> 01:16:10.857
Oh, no.

01:16:11.775 --> 01:16:13.527
Oh, my God, no.

01:16:14.945 --> 01:16:16.738
Guys!

01:16:21.243 --> 01:16:22.077
Hey.

01:16:22.327 --> 01:16:24.705
So, quick update,
the paella is still simmering.

01:16:24.788 --> 01:16:26.873
It's gonna take a little longer
than I thought.

01:16:26.957 --> 01:16:28.000
Whatever, Devon.

01:16:38.218 --> 01:16:39.845
Any chance we could have sex?

01:17:05.912 --> 01:17:06.747
Fine.

01:17:14.838 --> 01:17:16.089
Good morning, sunshine.

01:17:17.007 --> 01:17:20.427
I'd love to stick around and snuggle,
but the paella is probably peaking.

01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:21.887
Devon, get the fuck out.

01:17:22.054 --> 01:17:23.055
To be continued.

01:17:27.517 --> 01:17:28.560
Rebecca?

01:17:29.770 --> 01:17:32.230
What's going on?
Are you okay? Did you pass out?

01:17:32.648 --> 01:17:34.733
No, I'm not okay.

01:17:35.108 --> 01:17:37.361
-I threw my back out.
-Oh, no.

01:17:37.527 --> 01:17:40.238
-Okay, let me call Tammy.
-No, Naomi, shut up, shut it.

01:17:40.322 --> 01:17:41.490
-Okay.
-Just help me up here.

01:17:41.573 --> 01:17:42.407
You got it.

01:17:42.491 --> 01:17:44.326
-Okay, just get me up.
-Okay, you got it.

01:17:44.409 --> 01:17:46.703
-Okay, ready? One, two, three...
-No problem.

01:17:50.248 --> 01:17:51.124
Oh, honey.

01:17:51.375 --> 01:17:52.501
Are you okay?

01:17:53.126 --> 01:17:54.378
I was lying here all night.

01:17:55.462 --> 01:17:56.546
And I realized...

01:17:57.297 --> 01:17:58.548
Abby was right about me.

01:17:59.216 --> 01:18:01.677
I did need to take a good hard look
in the mirror,

01:18:02.135 --> 01:18:04.179
or in this case, the door.

01:18:05.263 --> 01:18:06.598
And as I was lying here,

01:18:06.973 --> 01:18:08.934
I saw every truth about myself.

01:18:09.518 --> 01:18:10.394
Soon,

01:18:10.977 --> 01:18:12.854
a trio of raccoons joined me.

01:18:13.647 --> 01:18:14.481
Right there.

01:18:15.565 --> 01:18:16.400
Yeah.

01:18:17.109 --> 01:18:19.069
I locked eyes with the dad.

01:18:21.154 --> 01:18:23.365
Once you've looked
in the eye of a raccoon,

01:18:24.449 --> 01:18:25.659
you know your truth.

01:18:27.035 --> 01:18:28.912
How did you know he was the dad?

01:18:29.162 --> 01:18:31.164
He was just the leader, I could tell.

01:18:31.957 --> 01:18:33.083
But you didn't, like, look at--

01:18:33.166 --> 01:18:36.586
They were all with me, though.
They stayed here. It was amazing.

01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:39.506
-You saw a family of raccoons?
-Yes.

01:18:40.424 --> 01:18:41.508
And you communicated with them?

01:18:41.591 --> 01:18:43.802
I connected with them
more than anyone this whole weekend.

01:18:44.845 --> 01:18:46.638
Honey, did you take that molly?

01:18:47.347 --> 01:18:49.015
They helped me see what I really am.

01:18:49.725 --> 01:18:51.893
-An old lady.
-What?

01:18:52.352 --> 01:18:54.646
Yes, it's true. I'm old, 50!

01:18:54.730 --> 01:18:56.606
-That's half a fucking century.
-Listen...

01:18:57.232 --> 01:19:00.902
we are all getting older, and...
maybe our bodies aren't working--

01:19:00.986 --> 01:19:02.654
Fuck feedback.
I don't want any feedback right now.

01:19:02.738 --> 01:19:04.823
-Okay.
-I need to make some big changes.

01:19:05.407 --> 01:19:06.241
Number one...

01:19:07.492 --> 01:19:08.744
I'm in a shitty marriage.

01:19:09.536 --> 01:19:13.373
Brian is a world-class ding-dong.

01:19:16.084 --> 01:19:16.918
Thank God.

01:19:17.961 --> 01:19:19.504
Brian sucks.

01:19:20.922 --> 01:19:22.716
Hey, what's going on in here?

01:19:23.675 --> 01:19:25.844
Rebecca threw her back out,
and Brian sucks.

01:19:26.094 --> 01:19:27.471
What? No.

01:19:27.554 --> 01:19:28.972
Val, she knows.

01:19:29.848 --> 01:19:31.516
-Thank God.
-Yeah, we don't like him.

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.852
-Such an asshole.
-I'm done lying to myself.

01:19:34.186 --> 01:19:36.021
I'm ready to tell it like it is.

01:19:36.104 --> 01:19:37.814
It's just like Lady Sunshine said.

01:19:38.190 --> 01:19:40.567
It is later than we think, so--

01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:43.820
Okay. Get me up off this floor.

01:19:43.945 --> 01:19:48.492
'Cause we are gonna do everything
on that goddamn itinerary,

01:19:48.575 --> 01:19:50.160
and we are gonna do it now!

01:19:50.243 --> 01:19:52.788
This is really good news,
'cause I have planned exciting things.

01:19:52.871 --> 01:19:55.290
Where's Catherine?
Has anyone seen her this morning?

01:19:55.373 --> 01:19:59.044
Oh, my God, did she leave early
to do that stupid-ass cooking show?

01:19:59.169 --> 01:20:01.505
Unbelievable, she full-on bailed
on Rebecca's birthday.

01:20:01.588 --> 01:20:05.133
-Oh, happy birthday by the way.
-Happy birthday!

01:20:05.592 --> 01:20:06.593
Load me up!

01:20:06.843 --> 01:20:07.928
-Okay.
-Let's go!

01:20:08.011 --> 01:20:10.055
-You all right?
-Go! Move!

01:20:10.138 --> 01:20:11.890
-Okay, don't--
-Get me out of this bathrobe, though.

01:20:11.973 --> 01:20:15.018
It's really depressing.
Put me in my finest muumuu!

01:20:16.853 --> 01:20:19.022
Hey! Good news.

01:20:19.231 --> 01:20:21.107
Two hours and counting on the paella.

01:20:21.191 --> 01:20:23.902
How in God's name
is that paella not ready?

01:20:24.069 --> 01:20:26.112
I got a little sidetracked last night.

01:20:26.404 --> 01:20:28.573
-Stop.
-Okay, you know what? It's fine.

01:20:28.657 --> 01:20:31.743
-We don't even want the paella.
-No, I can't wait to taste it, Devon.

01:20:31.827 --> 01:20:34.162
No, let's not bullshit him.
We don't want the paella.

01:20:34.246 --> 01:20:36.957
Life is too short to wait for the paella!

01:20:37.749 --> 01:20:41.670
Ladies, we are gonna grab this day
by the motherfucking balls.

01:20:41.753 --> 01:20:44.965
I'm gonna get this wheely chair
onto this senior van,

01:20:45.048 --> 01:20:48.343
-and I'm going to my birthday brunch!
-Yeah! All right, let's do it!

01:20:48.426 --> 01:20:49.427
Let's move it! Yeah!

01:20:50.512 --> 01:20:51.596
I feel every bump.

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:53.348
-Oh, okay, sorry.
-Okay, no, it's all right.

01:20:56.059 --> 01:20:57.394
My work here is done.

01:20:59.646 --> 01:21:01.898
Okay, are you ready?

01:21:01.982 --> 01:21:05.694
-Lay it on me. Big five-oh.
-Okay, here we go.

01:21:06.027 --> 01:21:07.863
-Keep your eyes closed.
-Okay.

01:21:10.323 --> 01:21:13.243
<i>Happy, happy birthday</i>
<i>It's your special day</i>

01:21:13.326 --> 01:21:16.246
<i>Have a slice of pizza</i>
<i>What's your favorite way? Hey!</i>

01:21:17.122 --> 01:21:19.332
This is like end of <i>A League of Their Own</i>

01:21:19.416 --> 01:21:21.877
where the baseball ladies show up
at the hall of fame.

01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:23.044
So, check it out.

01:21:23.295 --> 01:21:25.881
I just want to show you what I--
what we did. Okay.

01:21:25.964 --> 01:21:28.466
We got the original sign from Antonio's.

01:21:29.092 --> 01:21:30.844
It says "Happy birthday, Rebecca."

01:21:30.969 --> 01:21:32.762
There's pictures of us.
These are the prices...

01:21:32.846 --> 01:21:33.680
Oh, my God.

01:21:33.763 --> 01:21:35.390
...that we had
when we were waiting tables.

01:21:35.473 --> 01:21:37.601
Here is the mural
that somebody did a copy of.

01:21:37.684 --> 01:21:39.436
But what's different about the face?

01:21:40.729 --> 01:21:45.483
-You didn't! How did you do that?
-We had Antonio's pizza flown in.

01:21:45.567 --> 01:21:47.360
-And these...
-Oh, my God.

01:21:47.485 --> 01:21:50.655
...are the original bread baskets we used.
And everyone can take one of these home.

01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:52.198
Wow. That is--

01:21:52.282 --> 01:21:54.576
Okay, so, Antonio could not be with us
'cause he's dead.

01:21:54.659 --> 01:21:57.954
But we have our DJ dressed up
like Antonio,

01:21:58.038 --> 01:22:00.582
and he is ready to get this party started!

01:22:21.394 --> 01:22:23.104
Well, doesn't this look fun.

01:22:23.939 --> 01:22:26.066
-Catherine!
-Cut it!

01:22:26.149 --> 01:22:28.151
Catherine! Hey! Catherine!

01:22:28.526 --> 01:22:30.111
Sorry, we thought you left.

01:22:30.570 --> 01:22:31.738
I have a shirt for you.

01:22:31.863 --> 01:22:35.075
-Did you guys even notice that I was gone?
-We tried to contact you.

01:22:35.158 --> 01:22:37.702
-The Wi-Fi here is...
-The password is so long.

01:22:37.786 --> 01:22:40.205
I shouldn't have even come on this trip.
I'm clearly not wanted.

01:22:40.288 --> 01:22:41.998
I mean,
and Abby, can you just be honest?

01:22:42.082 --> 01:22:44.584
Did you get a five-bedroom
because I wasn't really invited?

01:22:44.876 --> 01:22:48.046
What? No.
I honestly thought Jenny wouldn't show.

01:22:48.129 --> 01:22:50.382
-Same.
-Whatever, I don't care anymore.

01:22:51.091 --> 01:22:53.343
Don't worry,
you clearly won't notice that I'm gone.

01:22:56.888 --> 01:22:57.764
Wow.

01:22:59.224 --> 01:23:00.058
Hey, cut it.

01:23:01.351 --> 01:23:02.477
I thought she was clapping.

01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:05.021
-It was a slow clap.
-She's clapping sarcastically.

01:23:05.105 --> 01:23:07.607
Wait, who's talking? I can't see.
What's happening?

01:23:07.691 --> 01:23:10.402
-Okay, what's going on here?
-Oh, what's going on here

01:23:10.485 --> 01:23:12.946
is I threw my back out 'cause I'm old.

01:23:13.029 --> 01:23:14.948
Oh, my God, Rebecca, you are not old.

01:23:15.031 --> 01:23:18.910
Oh, please, just don't throw the word
"vivacious" at me or I will lose it.

01:23:20.578 --> 01:23:22.789
Naomi, what is with the slow clap?

01:23:23.039 --> 01:23:24.332
Oh, I am just applauding

01:23:24.416 --> 01:23:27.043
the greatest self-fulfilling prophecy
of all time.

01:23:27.127 --> 01:23:28.461
What are you talking about?

01:23:28.545 --> 01:23:31.464
You always think that you're not invited
or we leave you out.

01:23:31.548 --> 01:23:32.924
So you bury yourself in your work,

01:23:33.008 --> 01:23:36.928
but then, you're so buried in your work
that you <i>are </i> left out.

01:23:37.345 --> 01:23:40.306
I'm busy, okay? I can't just take off work
whenever I feel like it,

01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:43.101
and I shouldn't have to apologize
for being successful.

01:23:43.393 --> 01:23:47.147
We are not asking you to apologize
for being successful.

01:23:47.522 --> 01:23:49.524
I'm proud as fuck of you!

01:23:49.899 --> 01:23:53.778
But have you ever considered
that we might really need you here?

01:23:54.821 --> 01:23:56.823
We all need all of us here.

01:23:56.906 --> 01:23:59.659
I need to know that we're all gonna
be there for each other,

01:23:59.743 --> 01:24:01.786
because this group is sacred to me

01:24:02.537 --> 01:24:05.457
And if we can't get
through a weekend together,

01:24:07.250 --> 01:24:09.377
well, then I'm completely lost.

01:24:10.628 --> 01:24:14.132
I am going through a really hard time,
and...

01:24:14.966 --> 01:24:16.342
I... You know what?

01:24:16.676 --> 01:24:18.094
God, fuck it!

01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:20.096
Fuck!

01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:23.183
Fuck. DJ, play that fucking song!

01:24:23.933 --> 01:24:24.809
Cut it.

01:24:26.186 --> 01:24:27.270
What hard time?

01:24:31.566 --> 01:24:33.443
I finally took the BRCA gene test.

01:24:33.777 --> 01:24:34.944
And my results came back,

01:24:35.653 --> 01:24:38.490
and I'm too afraid to call
because I'm not ready to hear

01:24:38.573 --> 01:24:40.617
that I'm dying of breast cancer. Okay?

01:24:44.579 --> 01:24:45.413
My God.

01:24:55.507 --> 01:24:58.093
Why isn't anybody telling anybody shit?

01:24:58.176 --> 01:24:59.928
Because Lady Sunshine was right.

01:25:00.053 --> 01:25:01.387
No, she wasn't.

01:25:03.181 --> 01:25:04.516
Maybe I should go after her.

01:25:04.599 --> 01:25:08.103
There's a slideshow coming up that
I think's gonna really lift her spirits.

01:25:08.228 --> 01:25:12.023
Abby, do you really think a slideshow
is gonna make her fears go away?

01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:14.651
What? I don't know. Maybe.

01:25:15.151 --> 01:25:17.987
Look, Rebecca.
I'm just trying to fix this birthday

01:25:18.071 --> 01:25:21.366
so you can have fun, okay?
Why is this so difficult?

01:25:22.075 --> 01:25:25.537
All right, Abby,
let's get real here, okay?

01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:29.332
You got fired, right?
And this planning this birthday

01:25:29.415 --> 01:25:32.085
is probably the first sense of control
you've had in years.

01:25:32.544 --> 01:25:35.463
That's totally okay,
but you asked me over and over

01:25:35.547 --> 01:25:38.007
what I wanted for my birthday,
but you didn't listen.

01:25:38.091 --> 01:25:40.301
So let's stop pretending
that this weekend is about me

01:25:40.385 --> 01:25:42.387
because it's all about you.

01:25:52.021 --> 01:25:53.148
Don't come after me.

01:25:53.439 --> 01:25:56.151
I'm not coming after you.
This is a dual storm out.

01:25:56.234 --> 01:25:58.194
Where are we going? Do you see them?

01:25:58.736 --> 01:26:00.071
Naomi, stop.

01:26:00.155 --> 01:26:02.115
Leave me alone. I want to be by myself.

01:26:02.699 --> 01:26:04.075
I wanna be by myself!

01:26:05.994 --> 01:26:08.413
Naomi, wait, you're not dying.

01:26:08.496 --> 01:26:09.956
You're gonna be fine.

01:26:10.165 --> 01:26:12.792
Really? How do you know, Val?
What are you, an oracle?

01:26:12.876 --> 01:26:14.294
Are your eyeballs a mammogram?

01:26:14.377 --> 01:26:16.462
You just scan me,
and you know I'm gonna be fine?

01:26:16.546 --> 01:26:19.215
I don't know, okay?
I'm trying to be a nice person.

01:26:19.299 --> 01:26:21.718
Can I ask you something?
Why did you tip Lady Sunshine?

01:26:22.302 --> 01:26:25.680
She charged, like, $500
to tell all of us that we sucked.

01:26:25.889 --> 01:26:29.017
I can tip whoever the hell I want
as much as I want.

01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:30.435
I'm a grown-ass woman.

01:26:30.518 --> 01:26:33.062
Good. Go tip the whole world.
See how that works for you.

01:26:33.354 --> 01:26:34.898
This is a nightmare.

01:26:35.231 --> 01:26:36.524
Then go home, Jenny.

01:26:36.649 --> 01:26:38.109
We all know you want to.

01:26:38.193 --> 01:26:41.529
All weekend, all these withering glances,
making me feel like two cents.

01:26:41.613 --> 01:26:44.741
Well, what do you want?
A round of applause for most planning?

01:26:44.824 --> 01:26:47.160
Naomi, be a grown-up and call your doctor.

01:26:47.785 --> 01:26:49.621
You are acting like a millennial.

01:26:49.704 --> 01:26:50.955
How dare--

01:26:51.998 --> 01:26:53.291
-Something bit me!
-What did?

01:26:53.374 --> 01:26:55.001
Oh, my God! A snake.

01:26:55.084 --> 01:26:56.419
What?

01:26:56.502 --> 01:26:58.254
-Oh, my God!
-No!

01:26:58.338 --> 01:27:01.382
-Someone tell me what's happening!
-Naomi got bit by a snake!

01:27:01.633 --> 01:27:02.926
Oh, my God, it's like the cards.

01:27:03.468 --> 01:27:06.095
-Old rocks, snakes.
-Oh, my God, it's happening.

01:27:06.346 --> 01:27:09.641
Lady Sunshine was for real.
I bet if we looked it up on the internet,

01:27:09.724 --> 01:27:11.643
we'd find out that she's been dead
for 50 years.

01:27:11.726 --> 01:27:14.979
Oh, my God, my leg is seizing up! Fuck!

01:27:15.063 --> 01:27:17.774
Everybody, stay really calm.
We need to elevate it. We need to ice it.

01:27:17.857 --> 01:27:19.692
We need to call 911. We're gonna call 911.

01:27:19.776 --> 01:27:22.195
We're calling 911.
Fuck me, there's no signal.

01:27:22.278 --> 01:27:24.989
-Fucking never service.
-Does anyone have a hot spot?

01:27:25.073 --> 01:27:26.658
Does anyone know how to get it brighter?

01:27:26.741 --> 01:27:29.077
-I just took three pictures.
-...then look for brightness...

01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:33.164
-My phone is so slow.
-Oh, my God, I'm gonna die!

01:27:33.957 --> 01:27:35.625
No, you're not gonna die, Naomi.

01:27:35.708 --> 01:27:38.670
You're not gonna die, and you know why?
'Cause I'm going to get help.

01:27:38.795 --> 01:27:40.505
Val 2.0!

01:27:41.422 --> 01:27:42.799
Val!

01:27:44.050 --> 01:27:45.260
Oh, my God!

01:27:47.053 --> 01:27:49.973
Shit!
It sounds like Val's getting smaller!

01:27:54.143 --> 01:27:54.978
Wait!

01:27:55.853 --> 01:27:57.605
-Wait!
-What's going on?

01:27:57.981 --> 01:28:00.441
-What was that?
-Val fell down the hill.

01:28:01.109 --> 01:28:04.070
-I'm going.
-What? You're going?

01:28:04.153 --> 01:28:05.446
Wait, Jenny's going?

01:28:06.322 --> 01:28:07.740
Someone's gotta help her.

01:28:07.824 --> 01:28:09.534
Why don't we just go back
the way we came in?

01:28:09.617 --> 01:28:11.786
No! Hell no! There's snakes back there.

01:28:12.578 --> 01:28:14.664
-No, Jenny!
-What's happening?

01:28:15.290 --> 01:28:17.417
-Jenny?
-Jenny, no!

01:28:18.376 --> 01:28:21.254
Jenny? Oh, my God, how is she not falling?

01:28:21.587 --> 01:28:22.880
Hey, Jenny!

01:28:23.339 --> 01:28:25.675
Wow. Did she ski as a kid?

01:28:28.052 --> 01:28:29.637
Man, she's keeping that wine safe.

01:28:32.098 --> 01:28:33.308
I am not gonna die

01:28:33.391 --> 01:28:35.893
of a poisonous snake bite
on the top of this hill.

01:28:36.144 --> 01:28:38.146
Not today, Satan! I got this.

01:28:38.479 --> 01:28:39.314
What?

01:28:40.315 --> 01:28:42.817
-I'm going!
-Okay, now, Naomi's going.

01:28:43.735 --> 01:28:46.654
Help me out of this cart,
I need to go down the hill.

01:28:48.698 --> 01:28:49.824
What about your back?

01:28:49.991 --> 01:28:52.952
-You know what? It's my birthday.
-Oh, God.

01:28:53.036 --> 01:28:56.914
And I'm not gonna lay here
and watch the fucking clouds go by.

01:28:57.081 --> 01:28:59.876
Now, get me off this cart.

01:29:00.335 --> 01:29:01.377
Hold on.

01:29:01.461 --> 01:29:04.339
-Naomi, you can do it!
-There's wine down here!

01:29:04.422 --> 01:29:05.798
Go!

01:29:08.885 --> 01:29:10.762
-Oh, boy.
-Oh, cripes.

01:29:13.973 --> 01:29:15.433
-No...
-Jump!

01:29:15.516 --> 01:29:16.351
Naomi!

01:29:17.226 --> 01:29:18.061
Fuck!

01:29:20.688 --> 01:29:22.065
Is everybody okay?

01:29:24.192 --> 01:29:25.068
Oh, my God.

01:29:26.152 --> 01:29:27.570
That fixed my back!

01:29:28.488 --> 01:29:29.822
Oh, God!

01:29:33.117 --> 01:29:34.410
I'm gonna take the easy way.

01:29:35.495 --> 01:29:38.039
-You did it. That was crazy.
-We did it.

01:29:38.122 --> 01:29:39.165
Oh, my God.

01:29:39.582 --> 01:29:41.376
Easy.

01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:45.421
Just get to the bush,
and you're fine from there.

01:29:45.671 --> 01:29:46.631
That's what she said.

01:29:51.427 --> 01:29:54.055
Just let go! We're here for you!

01:29:54.263 --> 01:29:55.431
You got this, Abby.

01:29:55.515 --> 01:29:58.226
-I'm gonna let go!
-You can do it!

01:29:59.894 --> 01:30:02.397
You're braving the wilderness, Abby!

01:30:06.734 --> 01:30:09.362
-You got it! Yeah!
-Of course I'm the last one left.

01:30:09.946 --> 01:30:11.197
Oh, my God.

01:30:13.074 --> 01:30:14.784
Hello? Oh, hi!

01:30:15.284 --> 01:30:17.036
Hi! The whole team's there. Hi, guys!

01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:19.163
-Cath, come on!
-Yeah!

01:30:19.247 --> 01:30:20.248
Great, go ahead.

01:30:21.207 --> 01:30:23.000
Are you kidding me? She's taking a call?

01:30:23.709 --> 01:30:24.544
Okay.

01:30:25.545 --> 01:30:28.798
So you're saying that you think
I would be stupid to pass on this offer.

01:30:30.716 --> 01:30:32.802
Well, I'm gonna be stupid. I'm gonna pass.

01:30:33.428 --> 01:30:36.431
You know what? Life is just going
by me faster than I thought it would,

01:30:36.514 --> 01:30:39.100
and I'm tired
of chasing the next big thing.

01:30:39.183 --> 01:30:41.519
I-- It's kept me from living
in the present.

01:30:42.812 --> 01:30:44.981
Okay, I'm gonna hang up
before I change my mind.

01:30:50.736 --> 01:30:53.030
In case you're wondering,
I said no to the job!

01:30:53.406 --> 01:30:55.491
-What is she saying?
-We can't hear you!

01:30:55.825 --> 01:30:58.369
I wanna be able to go on vacation,
you know?

01:31:04.542 --> 01:31:06.335
I'm so sorry, we can't hear you!

01:31:06.878 --> 01:31:09.005
But here's the thing you do have to know
about me.

01:31:09.088 --> 01:31:10.631
I love working.

01:31:10.923 --> 01:31:12.383
I do. I love it.

01:31:14.302 --> 01:31:15.845
But I'm gonna come down there.

01:31:17.054 --> 01:31:18.306
I'm coming down now,

01:31:19.056 --> 01:31:20.475
because I choose you.

01:31:21.184 --> 01:31:23.060
-I mean, should we nod?
-I can't hear a word.

01:31:23.144 --> 01:31:24.061
I didn't get one word of that.

01:31:24.145 --> 01:31:27.607
Adrian, comma, send ambulance
to Sacred Moon Winery, period.

01:31:27.690 --> 01:31:30.234
Friend bitten by snake, exclamation point,
question mark.

01:31:30.318 --> 01:31:32.195
Snake emoji. Send.

01:31:47.251 --> 01:31:49.337
Swan dive maybe wasn't the best idea.

01:31:49.962 --> 01:31:51.589
Gonna feel that one tomorrow.

01:31:55.134 --> 01:31:56.552
But it was glorious.

01:31:57.678 --> 01:31:58.513
Thanks.

01:32:02.183 --> 01:32:04.435
Okay, so the snake wasn't venomous.

01:32:05.478 --> 01:32:08.272
We treated it
with some antibacterial cream, and...

01:32:09.148 --> 01:32:10.024
you're all good.

01:32:11.317 --> 01:32:14.570
Well, I'm definitely not all good.

01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:16.906
Little condescending.

01:32:16.989 --> 01:32:20.993
So, we almost died on that hill
because of a <i>non</i>-venomous snake?

01:32:21.410 --> 01:32:23.704
Yeah, you know, honestly, I think
it might have been a sharp twig.

01:32:25.164 --> 01:32:26.958
Sometimes those catch you
at the wrong angle.

01:32:27.041 --> 01:32:29.335
No, it was a snake. We saw a snake.

01:32:29.418 --> 01:32:31.045
Also, I'm a grown woman.

01:32:31.128 --> 01:32:33.631
I think I know when I've been bit
by a snake.

01:32:34.090 --> 01:32:35.800
Let me guess, Dr. Dickswing,

01:32:36.050 --> 01:32:37.468
it's because of her period.

01:32:37.552 --> 01:32:39.971
That's the problem with the medical
establishment, no one listens to women.

01:32:40.054 --> 01:32:43.516
Right. This is why more women die
of heart attacks, right here.

01:32:43.891 --> 01:32:45.851
Also, I don't appreciate it

01:32:45.935 --> 01:32:48.938
when you grin at me
while giving me my results.

01:32:49.230 --> 01:32:50.398
'Cause I could have died.

01:32:50.815 --> 01:32:52.066
When I get home,

01:32:52.525 --> 01:32:55.111
and if there <i>is </i> venom in my ankle,

01:32:55.236 --> 01:32:58.948
I'm gonna come back here
and make sure you personally suck it out.

01:32:59.031 --> 01:32:59.991
-Yeah.
-Suck it.

01:33:00.241 --> 01:33:02.368
I'm not entirely sure
what's happening here.

01:33:02.952 --> 01:33:04.954
-Thank you, that'll be all.
-Okay, thank you.

01:33:05.079 --> 01:33:09.041
Also, tell your mom to pick you up
after your shift, Doogie!

01:33:09.584 --> 01:33:11.335
Fucking dickweed.

01:33:12.086 --> 01:33:12.962
So should we...

01:33:14.797 --> 01:33:16.299
head on back to the house?

01:33:19.302 --> 01:33:20.386
We need to make a call.

01:33:27.852 --> 01:33:28.894
Call doctor...?

01:33:30.396 --> 01:33:31.314
Melton.

01:33:33.649 --> 01:33:34.817
Call Dr. Melton.

01:33:37.153 --> 01:33:38.529
<i>Hello, Dr. Melton's office.</i>

01:33:38.821 --> 01:33:40.364
Hi, this is Naomi Reid.

01:33:40.531 --> 01:33:43.034
I'm calling for the results
of my BRCA test.

01:33:43.576 --> 01:33:46.954
<i>Yes, let me get the results for you.</i>
<i>Let me put you on a brief hold, okay?</i>

01:33:47.371 --> 01:33:48.205
Yeah.

01:33:49.248 --> 01:33:51.000
That was a really good Naomi.

01:33:55.296 --> 01:33:57.673
No matter what this news is,
we got you, okay?

01:34:02.219 --> 01:34:03.179
<i>Hi, Mrs. Reid?</i>

01:34:04.013 --> 01:34:06.057
<i>Hi, yes, your blood work</i>
<i>came back negative.</i>

01:34:06.724 --> 01:34:08.809
Thank you.

01:34:11.812 --> 01:34:13.481
Thank you so much.

01:34:13.898 --> 01:34:16.192
And what were the results of my fart test?

01:34:20.446 --> 01:34:21.614
I don't have it.

01:34:22.948 --> 01:34:23.824
Hey, Janiece.

01:34:24.533 --> 01:34:26.994
How's your son? Still on the chess team?

01:34:27.078 --> 01:34:30.206
-Oh, yeah, big nerd.
-It's the only way to raise 'em.

01:34:30.831 --> 01:34:32.166
Hey, Tammy's here.

01:34:32.416 --> 01:34:34.168
How'd you know where we were at?

01:34:34.293 --> 01:34:36.796
Well, I heard on the scanner
that six middle-aged ladies

01:34:36.879 --> 01:34:39.006
went to the ER.
Figured it had to be you guys.

01:34:42.802 --> 01:34:45.471
So, do you still want me to call
that taxi for you?

01:34:46.138 --> 01:34:48.641
No. My friend will drive us.

01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:51.560
Did not know we were using the f-word.

01:34:52.603 --> 01:34:54.563
I am deleting Jade.

01:34:55.564 --> 01:34:56.941
I'm too cool for her, I think.

01:34:57.024 --> 01:34:58.317
-Indeed.
-Poor thing.

01:34:58.943 --> 01:35:01.529
Well, at least you got a great painting
of the Nanny out of the deal.

01:35:01.612 --> 01:35:03.698
What did that cost you? Like, 50 bucks?

01:35:04.156 --> 01:35:05.032
Yeah, about that.

01:35:05.116 --> 01:35:08.160
-Let me take that plant off your hands.
-You deserve it, Janiece.

01:35:08.285 --> 01:35:10.162
Okay, come on, truck's out front.

01:35:10.871 --> 01:35:12.707
What happened to you guys anyway?

01:35:13.249 --> 01:35:15.751
-Fell down a hill.
-Seems about right.

01:35:40.234 --> 01:35:43.279
-Thank you, Tammy.
<i>-De nada.</i> Now...

01:35:43.487 --> 01:35:47.032
I'm just gonna remind you
to ping-pong between water and wine

01:35:47.116 --> 01:35:49.034
because that helps with the hangover.

01:35:49.326 --> 01:35:52.037
Oh, is that... the things we say now?

01:35:52.121 --> 01:35:53.205
Absolutely.

01:35:53.330 --> 01:35:55.708
-Good job, Tammy!
-Oh, good one, Tammy!

01:35:55.791 --> 01:35:58.586
-I'm gonna let you guys get to it.
-Tammy, stay and hang with us.

01:35:58.669 --> 01:36:02.131
-No, that's all right.
-Yeah! Sit right there.

01:36:02.214 --> 01:36:03.132
Come have some fun.

01:36:03.215 --> 01:36:05.676
-Park it. Drop your can.
-Park your pooter.

01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:08.679
-Thank you very much.
-All right, ladies, I just want to say...

01:36:09.138 --> 01:36:10.681
thank you for a great birthday.

01:36:11.307 --> 01:36:13.476
Rebecca. Happy birthday to Rebecca.

01:36:13.559 --> 01:36:17.730
-Come on, give it to me! All about me!
-Rebecca!

01:36:17.813 --> 01:36:19.648
-Happy birthday, love you.
-Cheers.

01:36:19.982 --> 01:36:20.983
Cheers.

01:36:23.944 --> 01:36:24.862
Oh, my God.

01:36:25.279 --> 01:36:26.864
-Oh, wow.
-It's cool, right?

01:36:27.990 --> 01:36:29.742
Abby, did you plan this?

01:36:30.409 --> 01:36:31.744
I love it!

01:36:32.578 --> 01:36:33.996
I'm so glad you like it.

01:36:43.255 --> 01:36:44.423
Guys, I fucked Devon.

01:36:45.341 --> 01:36:47.134
-What?
-Excuse me?

01:36:47.718 --> 01:36:50.304
I fucked Devon. I had sex with him.
I fucked Devon.

01:36:51.055 --> 01:36:52.723
-Paella Devon?
-Yeah.

01:36:54.433 --> 01:36:55.976
Oh, my God.

01:36:56.227 --> 01:36:58.395
This is mind-blowing.

01:36:59.021 --> 01:37:00.648
-Was it good?
-Oh, yeah.

01:37:00.856 --> 01:37:01.732
Dang.

01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:04.401
Ew, they're cheersing to it.

01:37:05.528 --> 01:37:06.695
Oh, my God.

01:37:07.154 --> 01:37:09.323
-I, too, fucked Devon.
-What?

01:37:10.699 --> 01:37:12.493
-No.
-Yeah, I did.

01:37:12.576 --> 01:37:14.954
-Don't do that right now.
-Did everybody fuck Devon?

01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:17.122
Did I fuck Devon?

01:37:17.748 --> 01:37:19.792
Guess he really did come with the house.

01:37:22.795 --> 01:37:24.797
-Oh, Tammy liked that one!
-Okay.

01:37:25.881 --> 01:37:28.133
You know,
I'm really glad I came on this trip.

01:37:28.592 --> 01:37:29.760
Oh, my God.

01:37:31.679 --> 01:37:32.638
I love you guys.

01:40:09.670 --> 01:40:11.922
<i>Are we singing that last part wrong,</i>
<i>or are we singing--</i>

01:40:12.006 --> 01:40:14.008
<i>-I beefed it so many times.</i>
