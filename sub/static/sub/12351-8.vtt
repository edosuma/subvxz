WEBVTT

00:01.014 --> 00:03.001
You really aren't clear
on the meaning of "no."

00:03.251 --> 00:04.663
But I'm very good with yes.

00:04.788 --> 00:06.630
As in: "yes, tomorrow
night sounds great."

00:06.755 --> 00:08.882
I thought if the two of
you could be friends again,

00:09.052 --> 00:11.326
then maybe we could all go back
to the way things used to be.

00:11.451 --> 00:13.779
We can't go back, but maybe
all three of us can

00:13.904 --> 00:15.472
try to move forward together.

00:17.923 --> 00:19.227
Get off!

00:20.382 --> 00:21.825
Look at those jackasses.

00:21.950 --> 00:23.568
We should go finish
what they started.

00:23.693 --> 00:25.134
Easy, bro, easy, bro. Come on.

00:25.259 --> 00:27.734
Zbz is constantly embroiled
in some kind of turmoil,

00:27.859 --> 00:29.714
and no one likes
a dysfunctional drama case.

00:29.839 --> 00:31.781
I would say zbz is ranked Fourth?

00:31.949 --> 00:33.698
- Fourth?
- It's all part of the cycle.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.031
If it really is a cycle,
then it's too late, right?

00:36.156 --> 00:37.206
It's like fate.

00:37.455 --> 00:39.497
As seniors,
we have to fight this cycle.

00:39.665 --> 00:41.529
The truth is we're
not number one anymore.

00:41.654 --> 00:43.412
We were hoping to
throw some killer mixers

00:43.537 --> 00:45.244
and eventually have the best rush

00:45.369 --> 00:46.940
this campus has ever seen.

00:48.309 --> 00:49.574
I hate putt-putt.

00:49.699 --> 00:53.064
And cute golf
attire is beyond even my powers.

00:53.189 --> 00:54.995
Just keep smiling. We don't want

00:55.120 --> 00:57.247
The sisters to figure out
how much this mixer sucks.

00:57.372 --> 00:59.203
This mixer sucks.
I think they know.

00:59.964 --> 01:02.332
It's 9:00am. On a thursday.

01:02.940 --> 01:05.312
I should be asleep.
Nicole's asleep.

01:09.795 --> 01:11.903
I can't even flirt with
the seven pi sigmas who

01:12.028 --> 01:14.452
bothered to show up because
I have coffee breath.

01:14.659 --> 01:16.686
They're not paying
attention to us anyway.

01:19.028 --> 01:21.405
I remember the days when all
they wanted to hump was us.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.290
I hate not being number one anymore.

01:23.585 --> 01:26.160
I thought you were going to get us
out of this, president ashleigh.

01:26.285 --> 01:28.760
I know our social
schedule isn't what it was,

01:28.885 --> 01:30.938
but things are looking up.

01:31.443 --> 01:33.559
And I'm working on
getting our prime table

01:33.684 --> 01:35.312
at dobler's back from gamma psi.

01:35.437 --> 01:36.459
We lost our table?

01:36.584 --> 01:39.305
And may I remind you we had
a pinning ceremony last week?

01:39.549 --> 01:41.544
Heather got pinned to
jeremy from kappa tau.

01:41.669 --> 01:42.977
Hardly good news.

01:43.289 --> 01:44.602
You sound like my parents!

01:46.270 --> 01:49.048
I heard a few sisters
talking about de-activating.

01:49.439 --> 01:51.264
One of them might've been me.

01:53.316 --> 01:54.142
Fore!

01:55.668 --> 01:56.621
But...

01:57.947 --> 01:59.535
But they haven't
heard the best part!

02:01.234 --> 02:03.781
We are having a mixer this saturday.

02:03.906 --> 02:05.059
At night.

02:05.184 --> 02:06.416
With omega chi.

02:07.030 --> 02:08.762
- We are?!
- Yeah, remember?

02:08.887 --> 02:10.532
You and evan are
such good friends now

02:10.657 --> 02:13.203
and you guys were talking about
how you missed the houses mixing

02:13.328 --> 02:15.705
and came up with the idea?
It was brilliant!

02:16.076 --> 02:16.998
We did.

02:17.234 --> 02:21.098
And they can't wait.
Omega chi and zbz, reunited

02:21.748 --> 02:22.892
and it feels so good.

02:23.221 --> 02:25.436
And you decided not
to tell us until now?

02:25.605 --> 02:27.729
That's what makes it a surprise!

02:29.220 --> 02:31.650
It's like our reintroduction
into the social top-ti

02:32.387 --> 02:34.796
and I'll be in charge of making
our pledges hump-able again!

02:36.579 --> 02:38.362
You should be thanking me.

02:44.648 --> 02:48.063
We have three days to
pull off our reintroduction

02:48.188 --> 02:51.333
into the social top-tier with
a mixer that doesn't exist?

02:51.640 --> 02:53.917
Look at the happy faces
on all the children.

02:54.042 --> 02:56.331
They're finally not
looking at me like

02:56.456 --> 02:58.012
they want to kill me in my sleep.

03:00.000 --> 03:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:08.174 --> 03:09.257
What's up, guys?

03:15.029 --> 03:16.321
New drinking game.

03:16.779 --> 03:18.505
Every time jeremy snores...

03:22.116 --> 03:24.453
- we drink.
- It's harder than it looks.

03:24.578 --> 03:26.872
You have to stop drinking
at the end of the snore.

03:29.217 --> 03:30.621
Or you get penalized.

03:31.624 --> 03:33.170
You just said "penalized."

03:34.381 --> 03:35.855
I Miss you guys.

03:36.758 --> 03:38.127
Where did you go?

03:38.252 --> 03:39.139
Oh, god...

03:39.264 --> 03:41.191
Did you learn how to manipulate
space and time

03:41.316 --> 03:43.592
so you could disappear
without us noticing?

03:43.838 --> 03:45.508
I knew you could do that!

03:46.584 --> 03:48.469
I might be a little bit buzzed.

03:49.259 --> 03:51.863
Yeah, I've been so busy
with so much crap lately.

03:51.988 --> 03:54.471
School, man, is so tough,
ex-girlfriend trouble...

03:54.702 --> 03:57.159
I'm just in the mood to be
with my boys and cut loose!

03:57.964 --> 03:59.775
You're on the moon
right now, aren't you?

04:00.657 --> 04:01.878
You're a hologram.

04:02.003 --> 04:03.408
You're so buzzed.

04:05.871 --> 04:07.002
Is cappie upstair?

04:20.918 --> 04:22.158
It's your little bro.

04:26.205 --> 04:27.303
Naked.

04:28.328 --> 04:29.517
Get out of here, perv.

04:33.807 --> 04:35.042
Greek 308

04:35.167 --> 04:37.552
Greek Team

04:43.768 --> 04:44.831
Fore!

04:45.559 --> 04:47.546
We get it.
We're ranked number four.

04:47.671 --> 04:49.095
No need to rub it in.

04:49.220 --> 04:50.975
I think he was trying
to make a golf joke.

04:51.100 --> 04:52.972
Some people appreciate
my sense of humor.

04:53.097 --> 04:54.608
Some people appreciate crocs.

04:55.059 --> 04:57.212
We had a golf mixer with pi sigma.

04:59.387 --> 05:01.341
The old putt-putt blow-off?

05:01.568 --> 05:03.643
We did the same thing
last year to tri-pi

05:03.768 --> 05:05.260
after their president dumped dino.

05:05.385 --> 05:07.885
Exactly. Which is why we need you

05:08.010 --> 05:10.521
guys to invite us
to a mixer this saturday night.

05:10.646 --> 05:13.360
- Do you guys have plans?
- Nothing set in stone.

05:13.641 --> 05:15.855
We were thinking about
having a low-key weekend.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.025
Think again,

05:17.150 --> 05:19.443
because we're giving you
a chance to mix with zbz!

05:19.612 --> 05:21.871
In the spirit of
reuniting old friends.

05:22.096 --> 05:24.453
It would really mean a lot to
our house during a rough time.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.159
Please, please, please!

05:32.476 --> 05:34.416
Great! One more thing.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.928
We kinda need you guys
to formally invite us,

05:37.053 --> 05:38.449
tonight during dinner.

05:38.574 --> 05:40.456
Maybe you could throw
in a little serenade?

05:40.632 --> 05:42.968
- You don't have to...
- The girls will expect it!

05:43.376 --> 05:44.717
No worries i would do it.

05:46.832 --> 05:47.765
Awesome!

05:48.626 --> 05:50.843
- Thanks, evan. See you tonight.
- All right.

05:51.143 --> 05:53.267
And, watch out for those sand traps!

05:55.355 --> 05:56.935
That wasn't funny at all.

05:58.585 --> 06:00.427
- Thanks, case!
- No problem.

06:06.778 --> 06:08.236
It was an accident.

06:09.327 --> 06:11.899
It seems as
though you saw milady naked.

06:13.458 --> 06:16.123
There's only one way to
restore the power balance. Come on,

06:16.991 --> 06:18.084
drop trou.

06:18.356 --> 06:19.480
He's right.

06:20.128 --> 06:21.265
It's only fair.

06:21.948 --> 06:23.085
Let's see the goods.

06:25.696 --> 06:26.864
I'm really sorry.

06:27.500 --> 06:29.513
Oh, my god, I'm not
at my breast right now.

06:30.682 --> 06:32.229
- "Best?"
- Right!

06:32.476 --> 06:35.045
And I came here to blow off
some steam with my big bro!

06:35.270 --> 06:37.755
There's no one better to
do that with than cappie.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.509
We're actually on our way
out to get something to eat.

06:40.634 --> 06:42.982
- You should come with.
- I don't want to intrude.

06:43.107 --> 06:44.734
No, don't worry about it.

06:46.781 --> 06:48.656
I think I left my backpack upstairs.

06:48.898 --> 06:50.656
Why don't you go get it?

06:52.055 --> 06:53.400
Hurry up,

06:53.525 --> 06:55.375
you don't wanna
be late for our threesome.

06:59.002 --> 07:00.419
How cute is he?!

07:02.720 --> 07:04.298
I'm on board with the threesome,

07:04.467 --> 07:06.496
I just didn't think it
was gonna be with spitter.

07:06.677 --> 07:09.614
He's so sweet and innocent.
I can't wait to corrupt him.

07:09.739 --> 07:12.075
That's just what I thought
when I first met him.

07:12.200 --> 07:15.675
Again: can you just assure me we're
not having sex with spitter tonight?

07:15.800 --> 07:17.479
What would you say

07:17.604 --> 07:20.555
if I told you that grant and I think
we're ready to tell the house?

07:20.680 --> 07:22.138
I'd say go for it, man.

07:22.263 --> 07:24.202
The guys love you and
the guys love grant.

07:24.327 --> 07:26.659
Why should that change when you
tell them you love each other?

07:26.784 --> 07:28.078
"Like" each other.

07:28.203 --> 07:30.523
And that's what I'm
worried about. It's change.

07:30.648 --> 07:33.001
People don't always
react well to change.

07:33.281 --> 07:35.419
I'm assuming that's
why you told griffin

07:35.544 --> 07:37.304
you joined the treble
makers acapella group

07:37.429 --> 07:39.622
when he saw you in
your pink bow-tie.

07:40.937 --> 07:42.628
Maybe we're over-thinking all this.

07:42.988 --> 07:45.798
Maybe sexual orientation
and socio-economic status

07:45.923 --> 07:48.591
aren't that big a deal in
the world. People are people.

07:48.819 --> 07:50.328
Yeah, you know what?

07:50.690 --> 07:52.994
This is only a big deal
if we make it a big deal.

07:53.427 --> 07:55.432
We have the power.

07:56.876 --> 07:58.402
Maybe you go first?

07:58.527 --> 08:00.571
No, you've been gay way
longer than I've been broke.

08:00.696 --> 08:02.044
You're up first.

08:04.004 --> 08:06.090
Do you have a lot
of parking tickets?

08:06.215 --> 08:08.767
I can't afford to. Why?

08:14.995 --> 08:16.981
Forget to pay your bill, chambers?

08:17.560 --> 08:20.148
And apparently you can't
cover a lease payment

08:20.273 --> 08:21.994
with dobler's drink coupons.

08:24.010 --> 08:26.500
And it looks like my
secret's coming out first.

08:31.826 --> 08:33.335
Irish car bomb!

08:40.885 --> 08:42.770
- Your turn, rusty.
- I'm underage.

08:42.940 --> 08:45.732
He's not exactly good with
liquor. Hence the nickname, "spitter."

08:45.901 --> 08:48.598
But he's not spitter tonight.
He's rowdy rusty.

08:48.945 --> 08:51.125
Rowdy rusty.
All right, I love it!

08:51.324 --> 08:54.021
You don't have to do this,
spitter, if you don't want to.

08:54.146 --> 08:55.246
Go!

09:02.031 --> 09:03.183
All right.

09:06.130 --> 09:07.377
You did it!

09:07.808 --> 09:09.162
Sort of.

09:09.287 --> 09:11.123
Yeah. Good job, spitter.

09:11.248 --> 09:13.382
Excuse me, rowdy rusty.

09:13.507 --> 09:14.635
Now what?

09:14.760 --> 09:17.639
No, I think that's quite
enough for one evening, rowdy.

09:19.186 --> 09:20.578
Or...

09:20.922 --> 09:23.268
See our waiter over
there ignoring us?

09:24.699 --> 09:27.080
We asked for our check,
like, 30 minutes ago.

09:27.859 --> 09:29.413
What a douche bag, right?

09:29.538 --> 09:31.278
You want me to say something to him?

09:31.576 --> 09:33.858
"Excuse me, pal, where's our check?"

09:35.284 --> 09:36.950
We're going to dine and dash.

09:37.119 --> 09:38.784
Spitter's not gonna dine and dash.

09:39.067 --> 09:41.874
And as a member of the food
services industry yourself,

09:41.999 --> 09:44.149
you should be sensitive to
the fact that this poor guy

09:44.274 --> 09:46.092
probably works here three...

09:48.433 --> 09:49.912
Wait up!

09:59.733 --> 10:01.770
I'm sure most of you
guys have figured out,

10:01.895 --> 10:03.266
I gave up my trust fund.

10:03.391 --> 10:06.730
It is a really personal
situation with my family

10:07.071 --> 10:09.358
but it's nice to know
my brothers have my back.

10:09.686 --> 10:11.674
Even if I'm gonna have
to start hitting you up

10:11.799 --> 10:13.520
for beer money from now on.

10:15.473 --> 10:17.263
So any new business?

10:18.429 --> 10:20.536
What's with this zbz mixer?

10:21.549 --> 10:23.109
It's this saturday...

10:23.234 --> 10:25.879
I know all that.
But why are we going?

10:26.371 --> 10:28.895
Aren't they all about
mixing with those

10:29.020 --> 10:30.885
kt losers this semester?

10:32.285 --> 10:33.965
Yeah, that's true but come on...

10:34.135 --> 10:36.510
- And this year, they kinda suck.
- And it's not like they're gamma psi.

10:36.679 --> 10:38.929
And last year, they
dissed our pref invite.

10:39.098 --> 10:41.306
I think we should go.
The girls could use our help.

10:41.475 --> 10:43.600
They just want our help
so they can climb back up.

10:46.360 --> 10:48.230
We're doing the mixer
because I said we are.

10:48.559 --> 10:50.329
I'm president and it's done.

10:50.454 --> 10:52.502
We know you've done half the girls

10:52.627 --> 10:54.307
in that house, but that's no reason

10:54.432 --> 10:56.368
the rest of us have to
waste a saturday on them.

10:56.493 --> 10:59.393
Watch your mouth, trip.
You're way out of line.

11:00.063 --> 11:02.035
I say we put the mixer to a vote.

11:17.997 --> 11:19.512
As pledge class president,

11:19.637 --> 11:21.928
I would like to formally
report that we are super excited

11:22.053 --> 11:24.616
about the omega chi mixer!
Thanks for making that happen!

11:24.741 --> 11:25.831
Just doing my job.

11:25.956 --> 11:27.874
When are they officially
going to invite us?

11:27.999 --> 11:29.754
- Any minute now!
- Great.

11:30.438 --> 11:33.501
I hope it's any minute. Can you
ask fisher to hold on dessert?

11:33.626 --> 11:35.447
He's already kept them
waiting 20 minutes!

11:35.572 --> 11:37.822
They're sorority girls.
They can deal with hunger pangs.

11:37.947 --> 11:38.946
Fine.

11:41.111 --> 11:43.517
Sit up straight.
Shoulders back. Boobs out.

11:43.642 --> 11:45.556
And heather, unbutton
your shirt a little.

11:45.681 --> 11:47.252
It might as well be a turtleneck.

11:47.377 --> 11:49.822
Why do I have to learn how to flirt?
I already have a boyfriend.

11:49.947 --> 11:52.937
Not a good one. And this isn't
about finding a boyfriend.

11:53.062 --> 11:54.804
This is for the sisterhood.

11:54.929 --> 11:57.081
Saturday night we want to
leave the omega chis dying

11:57.206 --> 11:59.613
for another mixer with
us as soon as possible.

12:02.922 --> 12:05.599
We're set to starve the
girls for 20 more minutes.

12:05.724 --> 12:07.759
Now where is...

12:10.481 --> 12:11.479
everyone,

12:11.752 --> 12:15.312
i'm sure this man needs no introduction,
and as for his brothers.

12:17.419 --> 12:18.804
As for his brothers...

12:18.929 --> 12:20.516
Actually it's just me.

12:21.303 --> 12:23.075
Let's just get on with it.

12:23.992 --> 12:26.000
Can I talk to you for a second?

12:27.892 --> 12:30.164
Evan's just shy.

12:31.287 --> 12:32.921
Cheesecake! Now!

12:37.806 --> 12:39.070
What's going on?

12:39.195 --> 12:41.753
I'm sorry, but the mixer's
not going to happen.

12:41.878 --> 12:44.095
I really tried, but the brothers,
they voted it down.

12:44.377 --> 12:45.471
What? Why?

12:45.676 --> 12:47.150
They brought up last year's pref,

12:47.275 --> 12:51.015
about how you guys dissed us, they
said zbz's just not a big draw anymore.

12:51.312 --> 12:53.271
And you're not exactly gamma psi?

12:53.622 --> 12:56.031
You're their president.
It's a party.

12:56.156 --> 12:58.178
Order them to party with
a group of hot chicks.

12:58.303 --> 12:59.434
That's just it, Due to

12:59.559 --> 13:02.465
a weird situation that's
recently come up in the house,

13:02.590 --> 13:05.616
some of the guys have
been questioning me.

13:05.811 --> 13:08.530
Why would they do that?
You're evan freaking chambers!

13:08.655 --> 13:10.446
Yeah, it's funny you would say that.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.662
Here's the deal.

13:12.787 --> 13:14.459
I gave up my trust fund.

13:14.628 --> 13:16.545
I didn't want
my parents controlling my life.

13:16.879 --> 13:19.194
I haven't spoken to them
since. I'm broke.

13:20.704 --> 13:22.681
So much for evan chambers.

13:23.438 --> 13:26.132
- Seriously?
- I know, I'm an idiot.

13:26.257 --> 13:28.723
It's probably the biggest
mistake of my entire life.

13:28.980 --> 13:31.601
No, it's the bravest
thing you've ever done.

13:32.258 --> 13:33.893
I can't believe it.

13:34.018 --> 13:35.745
I'm so proud of you.

13:36.720 --> 13:39.583
I wish some of the brothers
reacted the same way.

13:40.612 --> 13:42.674
But coinciding with me not being

13:42.799 --> 13:44.591
a "chambers" anymore, I
seem to have lost

13:44.716 --> 13:46.247
a lot of my influence on them.

13:46.372 --> 13:48.481
I'm sorry, but the mixer's off.

13:49.905 --> 13:52.838
The girls took down that
cheesecake like coyotes on road kill.

13:52.963 --> 13:55.117
What's going on with the mixer?

14:02.115 --> 14:03.592
What do we tell the girls?

14:03.761 --> 14:05.377
Their sugar
is gonna start wearing off

14:05.502 --> 14:08.096
and they'll be demanding answers.
We can't say the mixer's off.

14:08.415 --> 14:10.716
I just keep thinking
about what evan did.

14:10.841 --> 14:12.877
Giving up all that money
on principle and then being

14:13.002 --> 14:15.772
shunned by his own parents?
That must be so hard for him.

14:15.897 --> 14:18.078
He's always felt the weight
of the chambers name.

14:18.275 --> 14:19.843
I remember that being a dilemma.

14:19.968 --> 14:22.171
But still, to actually
give it all up like that?

14:22.296 --> 14:25.311
- I don't think i'd be able to do that.
- Oh, my god, snap out of it!

14:26.084 --> 14:28.832
We're supposed to be figuring out how to
salvage the party here!

14:28.957 --> 14:31.120
What's there to figure out?
There's nothing we can do.

14:31.245 --> 14:32.537
We're not gamma psi.

14:33.281 --> 14:35.689
What if we get gamma psi?

14:35.814 --> 14:37.177
We make the mixer a four-pack.

14:37.302 --> 14:39.593
Us, omega chi, gamma
psi, probably lambda sig.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.933
And not just any
four-pack: a super-fancy

14:42.058 --> 14:43.340
semi-formal four-pack!

14:43.679 --> 14:46.514
Where we have champagne,
a band, twinkle lights!

14:46.639 --> 14:49.220
- In three days?
- We have the founders' day money.

14:49.390 --> 14:51.592
But why would we even want
to party with the gamma psis?

14:51.717 --> 14:53.341
They stole our table at dobler's.

14:53.466 --> 14:55.213
And apparently our social life.

14:55.338 --> 14:56.770
Besides, they're kind of weird.

14:56.939 --> 14:59.342
It doesn't matter if they're
serial killers. They're number one.

14:59.467 --> 15:02.319
If we get them, we get the guys.
It worked for janet gunderson.

15:02.444 --> 15:05.272
Your dorky friend with the
mono-brow in seventh grade?

15:05.571 --> 15:08.354
She befriended me and became
popular by association.

15:08.479 --> 15:10.836
Then I introduced her
to tweezers and she stolen my boyfriend.

15:10.961 --> 15:13.348
See, it's perfect!
We are janet gunderson.

15:13.473 --> 15:15.001
The gamma psis are 12-year-old me.

15:15.126 --> 15:16.878
And we become number
one by association.

15:17.003 --> 15:19.251
I don't think that's how it works.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.430
What other options do I have?

15:22.328 --> 15:23.895
You're the president.

15:28.251 --> 15:31.068
I'm so hung over
and I don't even care!

15:31.193 --> 15:33.027
Last night was amazing.

15:33.152 --> 15:35.126
I did things I never
thought I would do.

15:35.465 --> 15:36.786
You're not hung over.

15:36.911 --> 15:38.564
- It's not spitter anymore.
- I know.

15:40.509 --> 15:43.176
From the small amount of irish car
you managed to imbibe,

15:43.301 --> 15:45.728
you're gassy from
the carbonation at best.

15:45.853 --> 15:48.359
Fine. Maybe I didn't
succeed at the drinking,

15:48.656 --> 15:50.865
- but I did do a dashing dine!
- It's "dine-and-dash."

15:51.034 --> 15:53.325
Boys! I hate to interrupt
your girlish squabble,

15:53.602 --> 15:55.975
but predators of
the deep is back on.

15:56.815 --> 15:59.671
I've never watched so many
episodes of one tv show

15:59.796 --> 16:02.948
since thatjoan of arcadia
marathon with my parents.

16:05.132 --> 16:06.435
Did I say parents?

16:06.883 --> 16:08.300
I meant my friends.

16:08.615 --> 16:10.175
My cool friends.

16:11.224 --> 16:12.625
And it was porn.

16:13.081 --> 16:14.889
Don't you have art
history in ten minutes?

16:15.214 --> 16:17.751
I was gonna head to women's studies.
We can walk together.

16:17.876 --> 16:19.993
And don't you have a bar
mitzvah to work tonight?

16:20.118 --> 16:22.794
I called in sick. And you guys shouldn't
be going to class either.

16:22.919 --> 16:24.666
The next episode is killer whales.

16:24.791 --> 16:27.270
- You can't Miss that!
- Killer whales!

16:27.608 --> 16:30.212
- It's on.
- Like donkey kong! Jinx!

16:33.618 --> 16:36.286
I just figured out why you two
are so perfect for each other!

16:36.622 --> 16:39.609
She's like the lady
version of you. Lady cappie!

16:41.949 --> 16:45.153
I'd like to think of you
as the male version of me.

16:45.892 --> 16:47.192
She's a keeper.

16:47.317 --> 16:49.810
She's a none of your other girlfriends
would blow off work for

16:49.935 --> 16:52.677
predators of the deep.
Just don't screw it up.

16:55.786 --> 16:57.830
That whale just ate that whole seal.

17:04.315 --> 17:06.156
What was up with you
in yesterday's meeting?

17:06.281 --> 17:08.137
Backing up j.p. And trip like that.

17:08.262 --> 17:10.432
Since when did you
become so anti-kt?

17:10.738 --> 17:13.388
I just think they're kind of obnoxious.
As do most of our brothers.

17:13.513 --> 17:16.470
You're clearly biased
because of "that rusty."

17:16.828 --> 17:19.073
"That rusty" is my best friend.

17:19.198 --> 17:21.265
And evan's been a really
good friend to me, too.

17:21.390 --> 17:23.621
He's been through a real
tough time lately, I just...

17:23.746 --> 17:25.916
I don't think he needs all
that crap from the house.

17:26.041 --> 17:27.699
It wasn't personal.

17:27.824 --> 17:29.821
I'm sure it felt that way to him.

17:33.579 --> 17:35.061
I just feel bad.

17:35.186 --> 17:38.057
He's been so supportive of us
coming out soon, like we talked about.

17:39.568 --> 17:41.050
Actually...

17:41.378 --> 17:42.813
I've been thinking.

17:44.936 --> 17:46.940
Things are good the way they are.

17:49.153 --> 17:50.807
So sneaking around,

17:50.932 --> 17:53.824
and coming up with excuses
why we're always together?

17:53.949 --> 17:55.897
You don't think that's
holding us back?

17:56.627 --> 17:58.736
I really like our
relationship how it is.

17:58.861 --> 18:02.101
Besides, seeing the way
everyone gossips about evan,

18:03.064 --> 18:05.108
I really don't want
to go through that.

18:20.767 --> 18:23.101
Guess what?
I stole you a dining hall muffin!

18:23.517 --> 18:24.910
What are you doing here?

18:25.035 --> 18:26.891
Booktacular-ing.

18:27.016 --> 18:28.665
We're readingeat,
pray, love this week

18:28.790 --> 18:30.664
and thought we'd do
a little of all three.

18:30.789 --> 18:34.050
I'm opting to partake in just the
eat part. Not that I don't love you.

18:34.175 --> 18:36.156
What are you doing stealing
dining hall muffins?

18:36.458 --> 18:38.901
- You know that's frowned upon.
- Don't you have a date with lana?

18:39.026 --> 18:42.673
I did, but I've been rescheduling
shamelessly on daley here,

18:42.798 --> 18:45.158
I really needed to make it up to him.
Sparkling cider?

18:45.703 --> 18:48.626
It's non-alcoholic but the fizzies
get up your nose and it's fun.

18:50.716 --> 18:52.583
You're just gonna blow her off?

18:52.708 --> 18:54.583
It's not like she's
never flaked on me.

18:54.708 --> 18:56.518
Our first date she kept
me waiting while

18:56.643 --> 18:59.008
she prank-phone called her old boss.

18:59.133 --> 19:00.553
For two hours.

19:02.007 --> 19:04.628
Excuse me. I have to go
relieve some cider fizzies.

19:10.311 --> 19:12.902
That girl is amazing
and he's flaking on her?!

19:13.307 --> 19:15.008
He's gonna drive her away.

19:15.696 --> 19:17.736
Is lana really worth
all the trouble?

19:17.861 --> 19:20.670
Oh, my god, she's the most
amazing girl I've ever met.

19:21.118 --> 19:22.833
For him, for cappie.

19:23.944 --> 19:26.140
If she's so perfect for him,
why would he blow her off?

19:26.265 --> 19:29.484
It's obvious! He's scared of
how much that he likes her.

19:29.609 --> 19:31.544
But you know he'll never admit it.

19:32.838 --> 19:35.631
I think we're gonna
have to go see lana

19:35.898 --> 19:38.249
about this situation.

19:41.765 --> 19:44.099
You're friends with cappie.
You're broke.

19:44.516 --> 19:46.404
Any other secrets
you want to reveal?

19:46.777 --> 19:49.478
I have a job that requires
me to wear a pink bow-tie.

19:49.727 --> 19:51.536
Stripping at the other
gentleman's choice?

19:52.254 --> 19:55.578
No, actually that probably
pays much, much more.

19:55.703 --> 19:57.169
I'm a cater-waiter.

19:57.739 --> 20:00.281
I have no car, I can't
pay my house dues.

19:58.869 --> 20:00.281
I can't pay my house dues.

20:00.449 --> 20:02.826
I should grovel to my parents
and get my trust fund back.

20:03.648 --> 20:05.620
You can't start doubting
yourself now.

20:05.788 --> 20:08.785
You did the right thing.
As your friend, I will help you.

20:09.165 --> 20:11.906
- We'll figure it out.
- Well, can you help me figure out

20:11.989 --> 20:13.926
how to get these guys
to take me seriously again?

20:14.009 --> 20:16.776
Because apparently the only title
they care about is Chambers.

20:16.859 --> 20:18.633
To think I believed that these guys

20:18.801 --> 20:21.469
were doing what their president said
because they respected me.

20:22.083 --> 20:23.883
Well, you know what?
Screw them.

20:24.443 --> 20:28.017
- Just because a few jerks...
- A few is enough to make a difference.

20:28.375 --> 20:31.146
So make a name for yourself that
has nothing to do with your parents.

20:31.642 --> 20:32.814
Or their money.

20:32.982 --> 20:35.066
You have friends
who really care about you.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.611
I said coquette, not spastic.

20:41.991 --> 20:44.393
Melanie, you look like
you're smuggling something.

20:45.058 --> 20:46.396
This was on the porch!

20:46.964 --> 20:49.038
It's from Natalie,
the Gamma Psi president!

20:49.206 --> 20:50.290
There's a note, too!

20:54.051 --> 20:55.628
Casey, can I see you in our room?

20:57.581 --> 20:59.549
It's OK, Case. Presidential orders.

20:59.976 --> 21:01.301
We'll talk more later?

21:07.930 --> 21:11.440
"Thank you for thinking of Gamma Psi
in regard to this weekend's four-pack.

21:11.523 --> 21:14.036
We regret to inform you
that we have a prior commitment.

21:14.119 --> 21:16.590
But please consider Gamma Psi
in the future.

21:16.673 --> 21:18.985
XoXo. Sisters in solidarity.

21:19.153 --> 21:20.111
Gamma Psi."

21:22.224 --> 21:24.046
You have to stop.
That's your fourth.

21:24.129 --> 21:27.076
Then stop rereading the letter!
It's not gonna change their answer!

21:28.336 --> 21:29.746
Plus, I'm eating the evidence.

21:29.914 --> 21:31.740
There's no point
in eating the evidence.

21:31.823 --> 21:35.480
The sisters will know we're not having
a four-pack if we don't have one!

21:37.036 --> 21:39.161
We've been rejected twice.
We have to accept it.

21:39.244 --> 21:41.593
No, we've been rejected twice
and no one can know about it!

21:41.676 --> 21:45.678
The whole school knows about this party!
I hired a photographer to take pictures.

21:45.974 --> 21:48.283
Pictures that will be
memorialized in hardback.

21:48.572 --> 21:49.849
The yearbook, Casey!

21:52.097 --> 21:54.437
Is Abby hiding in here?
She's late for her lesson

21:54.600 --> 21:57.398
on how to drink seductively
from both a cup and a bottle.

21:58.115 --> 21:59.484
You'd better go find her then,

21:59.652 --> 22:01.861
because this party is proceeding
as planned!

22:09.750 --> 22:13.331
I can't be the one responsible
for running this house into the ground.

22:13.486 --> 22:15.967
You're not responsible for running
this house into the ground.

22:16.050 --> 22:18.169
It's the cycle, or fate or whatever.

22:18.337 --> 22:21.381
Girls might deactivate if I don't do
something. This four-pack has to happen.

22:22.550 --> 22:23.722
Please help me.

22:27.278 --> 22:30.098
Let's make this work.
The Gamma Psis are reasonable girls.

22:30.266 --> 22:32.350
They're so nice,
it's almost disgusting.

22:32.518 --> 22:34.992
So if we appeal to them woman-to-woman,
lay our cards on the table,

22:35.075 --> 22:37.563
maybe we can get them
to change their minds.

22:37.894 --> 22:39.232
OK. That sounds good.

22:39.400 --> 22:41.286
You could talk to Katherine.
She's a Gamma Psi,

22:41.369 --> 22:43.861
maybe you can play
the panhellenic-solidarity card.

22:45.274 --> 22:48.449
It's one thing for me
to ask Evan for a favor,

22:48.617 --> 22:51.904
but I don't want to drag my brand-new
relationship with Katherine into this,

22:51.987 --> 22:55.456
especially since I'm hoping she will
give me this panhellenic board position.

22:56.292 --> 22:58.085
Let's take it straight to Natalie.

22:59.799 --> 23:02.650
I also want to know
where they got these cupcakes from.

23:02.939 --> 23:04.549
Because they're really good.

23:08.512 --> 23:10.388
- Hey, it's Rusty...
- Seriously, Rusty?

23:11.154 --> 23:12.657
You have to be planning this.

23:17.571 --> 23:18.884
What are you doing here?

23:19.258 --> 23:21.315
I know something happened
with Cappie.

23:21.483 --> 23:23.286
I think I'm kind of done with him.

23:23.737 --> 23:27.148
- Jackass blew me off.
- No, wait! That might be my fault.

23:27.842 --> 23:29.050
I told him that joke

23:29.133 --> 23:31.909
about how he shouldn't blow it
because you're so perfect for him.

23:32.077 --> 23:33.327
That freaked him out.

23:35.144 --> 23:38.166
- I don't date guys with issues.
- Someone without a college degree

23:38.334 --> 23:39.761
shouldn't be so choosy.

23:40.757 --> 23:42.378
- Who is this?
- Please!

23:44.963 --> 23:46.799
Can you give him another chance?

23:47.385 --> 23:49.302
This isn't exactly a mystery, Rusty.

23:49.457 --> 23:52.746
When a guy starts breaking dates
with you after things get physical,

23:52.829 --> 23:55.099
it means he just wanted to hook-up.

24:01.425 --> 24:03.137
I have a wedding

24:03.220 --> 24:05.557
between a labradoodle
and a shih-tzu to cater.

24:12.045 --> 24:13.301
Sorry, Rowdy.

24:14.208 --> 24:15.218
It's cool.

24:18.189 --> 24:19.296
She's all right.

24:20.121 --> 24:22.037
I mean, Sheila had
a way better rack.

24:28.057 --> 24:32.042
So did you hear we might be having
a four-pack with Gamma Psi this weekend?

24:33.527 --> 24:35.082
You and Grant gonna go together?

24:36.614 --> 24:39.250
Yeah, I guess,
the same way we always go together.

24:39.950 --> 24:41.687
Pretending like we're not together.

24:41.855 --> 24:43.581
Maybe you should just go together.

24:43.904 --> 24:45.471
Like for real this time.

24:46.663 --> 24:49.711
Because, you're planning on telling
the brothers at some point, right?

24:53.404 --> 24:54.628
What is this about?

24:56.137 --> 24:58.517
All anyone can talk about is
how I gave up my trust fund.

24:58.600 --> 25:01.332
Or they're questioning
everything I do, like Trip.

25:01.500 --> 25:04.134
Trip's still pissed off about
how hard you hazed him during hell week.

25:04.217 --> 25:05.746
I wouldn't take it personally.

25:06.672 --> 25:08.570
Maybe I would.
But what are you saying?

25:09.126 --> 25:11.634
That we should come out
so they'll talk about us instead?

25:13.215 --> 25:15.304
It sounds kind of obnoxious
if you put it that way.

25:15.472 --> 25:16.389
Kind of.

25:16.756 --> 25:19.160
But since you want
to come out anyway...

25:22.356 --> 25:26.016
I don't know what I want to do.
But it's up to me to figure it out, OK?

25:42.833 --> 25:44.489
ZBZs, what are you guys doing here?

25:44.849 --> 25:48.173
You know, the usual:
chatting about global politics, and,

25:48.256 --> 25:51.403
- a house-related leisure issue...
- We need to talk to Natalie about

25:51.486 --> 25:54.491
- the world's most awesome four-pack!
- That too.

25:54.574 --> 25:57.471
- We know about your prior commitment...
- There's no prior commitment.

25:57.639 --> 26:00.514
That is what Natalie tells people
whom she doesn't want to mix with.

26:00.597 --> 26:02.775
Did she send you
the little frowny-face cupcakes?

26:05.446 --> 26:08.191
We were just wondering
if there was a chance you would

26:08.359 --> 26:10.359
put in a word for us
about her changing her mind?

26:11.403 --> 26:14.813
That's Natalie's ouevre.
I don't really do leisure issues, so...

26:15.443 --> 26:16.415
Good luck.

26:18.308 --> 26:21.245
What bakery did she get
those cupcakes... from?

26:23.452 --> 26:25.223
You liked the cupcakes?

26:25.663 --> 26:26.806
I made them myself.

26:26.889 --> 26:28.878
Secret ingredient:
a little bit of love!

26:29.585 --> 26:32.839
What an honor to get a visit
from my two favorite ZBZs!

26:34.346 --> 26:37.553
The honor is all ours! We're so bummed
to hear about your prior commitment.

26:37.721 --> 26:39.931
Especially since it apparently
doesn't exist?

26:40.962 --> 26:43.851
I was trying to spare your feelings.
I was being polite.

26:44.383 --> 26:47.730
I didn't want ZBZ to spend that money
when I know my girls aren't gonna go.

26:48.212 --> 26:50.926
- They wouldn't show up?
- Our gals are pretty selective.

26:51.009 --> 26:53.393
They're always wondering,
"What's in it for Gamma Psi?"

26:54.004 --> 26:56.781
The political stuff gives me
a tummy-ache, but what can you do?

26:56.949 --> 26:57.907
You're fourth.

26:58.971 --> 27:01.869
- Then, I guess there's no...
- There's got to be something we can do!

27:03.646 --> 27:05.747
Anything! Do you guys
need a favor of some kind?

27:05.830 --> 27:08.709
Like doing our laundry or something?
Paying our electric bill?

27:08.877 --> 27:10.036
- No way.
- OK.

27:10.119 --> 27:11.379
What? Really?

27:11.547 --> 27:13.176
Yes. The electric bill.

27:13.340 --> 27:14.632
Ash! We can't...

27:14.800 --> 27:15.812
I got this.

27:16.099 --> 27:18.636
We'll pay your electric bill
until the end of the school year.

27:18.994 --> 27:19.971
What do you say?

27:20.714 --> 27:21.931
What a generous offer.

27:24.518 --> 27:28.104
And of course you will make sure
all your sisters show up tonight?

27:28.272 --> 27:29.358
Of course.

27:29.732 --> 27:31.445
And we can keep this little exchange

27:31.528 --> 27:33.192
- between us?
- Of course.

27:38.198 --> 27:39.547
Chocolate bunny?

27:51.101 --> 27:54.227
Thank you for your service.
I salute you.

28:02.453 --> 28:04.369
I knew it.
I knew you loved her!

28:04.975 --> 28:08.144
Don't startle a man in a strip club.
What if I'd been in lap-dance position?

28:09.104 --> 28:11.772
- How'd you know I was here?
- Beaver told me you were here.

28:14.234 --> 28:16.652
This is an unclean place.
You shouldn't be here.

28:18.030 --> 28:19.905
I have a friend and I want
to introduce you to.

28:20.073 --> 28:22.323
His name is Jesus,
and he pays much greater dividends

28:22.406 --> 28:24.327
than those dollar bills
in your underpants.

28:28.727 --> 28:32.482
Why are you blowing Lana off? We talked,
and she's ready to give up on you.

28:32.565 --> 28:34.378
- You talked?
- Yes. She had her shirt off.

28:35.188 --> 28:37.715
That doesn't matter!
I know you're in love with her

28:38.170 --> 28:40.880
and you can't stand it
or else you wouldn't be here.

28:40.963 --> 28:43.095
You only come here
when your heart's broken.

28:43.263 --> 28:45.306
I'm here because
I want to be around girls

28:45.474 --> 28:47.099
no more complex than strippers,

28:47.267 --> 28:49.821
who are really just nice girls
with bad dads.

28:50.973 --> 28:53.248
Tell me about your father.
Was he bad?

28:53.331 --> 28:55.983
Because I have a very good father
I'd like to talk to you about.

28:58.874 --> 29:00.071
This is what you do.

29:00.423 --> 29:03.721
You did it with Casey because you were
scared you guys were too different.

29:03.804 --> 29:06.369
But lady Cappie
is never going to give you

29:06.537 --> 29:09.038
a hard time about the things
that make you.

29:10.499 --> 29:12.625
And that's why I couldn't
let you do this.

29:13.466 --> 29:14.794
Spitter, what did you do?

29:15.140 --> 29:16.413
The name's Rowdy.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.798
Rowdy takes matters
into his own hands.

29:18.966 --> 29:21.321
She's here to give you another chance.
Hey, Lana.

29:21.802 --> 29:24.763
Listen closely, spitter:
I don't want another chance...

29:30.644 --> 29:32.937
Really? You don't like her?

29:51.418 --> 29:52.655
This looks amazing!

29:53.629 --> 29:56.085
Totally A-, very last minute.

29:56.253 --> 29:59.769
With these lampy light things,
I hope we're not paying OC's bill, too.

30:00.665 --> 30:01.936
I did what I had to do.

30:02.644 --> 30:06.058
And see, the yearbook photographer
is documenting all of it for posterity.

30:06.966 --> 30:08.873
Oh, my god, is that a caricaturist!?

30:11.415 --> 30:13.358
Look, I'm on the moon!

30:15.774 --> 30:17.390
It's classy because it's art.

30:17.662 --> 30:20.168
And he was also half-off
with the ice sculptures.

30:20.293 --> 30:23.056
Ice sculptures? The founders'
day money is supposed to last us

30:23.181 --> 30:25.517
- through next year's rush.
- But that's next year.

30:25.642 --> 30:28.152
- This will get us back on top now.
- When I said you weren't running

30:28.277 --> 30:29.910
this hous into the ground?
I was wrong

30:30.078 --> 30:32.493
I'm the one everyone's gonna blame
if we start losing sisters.

30:32.618 --> 30:35.124
You asked me for help and then you
don't listen to my advice!

30:35.292 --> 30:37.868
I'm the president. I have to do what
I think is right.

30:42.140 --> 30:44.083
I'm going to go greet
gamma psi's president.

30:53.804 --> 30:56.645
So, Tim, lacrosse sounds like
an interesting sport.

30:56.813 --> 30:59.440
- What position do you play?
- Mid-fielder.

31:00.232 --> 31:01.358
That's awesome.

31:01.721 --> 31:02.651
See you around.

31:07.032 --> 31:09.158
What was that?You have
something against mid-fielders?

31:09.750 --> 31:11.294
You said leave them wanting more.

31:11.603 --> 31:12.786
And I have a boyfriend!

31:16.960 --> 31:20.377
This is how you leave them
wanting more. Watch.

31:30.736 --> 31:33.724
You really wear a suit.
Most guys can't.

31:35.639 --> 31:36.894
What are you doing?

31:44.608 --> 31:50.032
Sorry! Um, I was teaching the pledges
how to flirt. That was a demonstration

31:53.016 --> 31:53.827
Great job.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.572
Come on, heather, let's go

31:59.954 --> 32:01.460
find another guy for you.

32:07.309 --> 32:09.342
I don't know what's taking
them so long at the bar.

32:10.921 --> 32:13.027
- I'm gonna go ask.
- No, wait, wait...

32:13.152 --> 32:14.916
Look how talented these girls are.

32:15.461 --> 32:16.568
And limber.

32:17.495 --> 32:18.686
What are they, cats?

32:19.310 --> 32:20.128
Sure.

32:21.381 --> 32:24.505
If you wanted to break up with her,
why didn't you just tell her?

32:24.630 --> 32:28.155
Hey, I was doing the immature guy thing
where I blow her off and wait for her

32:28.280 --> 32:32.107
to get the hint. It's worked for men for
thousands of years, because their friend

32:32.455 --> 32:34.577
don't usually intervene
and screw it all up.

32:34.745 --> 32:37.830
You sure you're not just driving her
away because you love her too much?

32:38.931 --> 32:41.000
I think you love her too much.
I barely know her.

32:43.726 --> 32:44.931
There is something.

32:45.895 --> 32:47.841
I think I want someone a little less
flaky.

32:48.383 --> 32:49.383
She's like you.

32:51.575 --> 32:54.847
You see yourself reflected in her,
and don't like what you see.

32:55.015 --> 32:57.558
- Are you growing up?
- You shut your damn mouth!

32:57.726 --> 33:00.311
Cappie, if I can get rowdy,
then you can...

33:02.596 --> 33:03.686
You guys having fun?

33:04.790 --> 33:07.568
So far ten girls are coming with me
to bible study next week.

33:07.736 --> 33:09.361
Or I just became their new pimp.

33:11.495 --> 33:13.485
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

33:14.778 --> 33:17.244
I'm not a dumbass. I know you
don't want me here.

33:20.697 --> 33:21.365
Wait.

33:21.969 --> 33:24.001
I'm sorry.
Can you just tell her the truth?

33:26.319 --> 33:27.685
No touching the girls.

33:29.244 --> 33:30.132
Excuse me...

33:30.625 --> 33:32.927
Viper. This is a misunderstanding.
She's not a girl.

33:33.095 --> 33:33.969
Not a girl?

33:34.445 --> 33:36.218
You're saying strippers
aren't real people?

33:36.741 --> 33:38.015
I got news for you,

33:38.183 --> 33:39.347
these women

33:40.131 --> 33:41.366
are somebody's daughters.

33:41.744 --> 33:44.730
Or mothers. Heck, I got a grandmother
here.

33:46.149 --> 33:48.150
You better think about that,
pipsqueak.

33:48.521 --> 33:49.860
The name's rowdy rusty.

33:50.028 --> 33:52.029
Uh, rus, I wouldn't.
He's really...

33:52.197 --> 33:55.783
And I'm not scared of your
pierced things and your tattoos.

34:05.876 --> 34:07.571
Katherine? You're leaving?

34:08.288 --> 34:11.422
My policy on parties is
basicaly a five-minute walk-through, but

34:11.591 --> 34:14.192
I rather enjoyed the caricaturist
and thought he captured my likeness,

34:14.317 --> 34:16.041
so I stayed a little bit longer.

34:26.795 --> 34:28.989
You're lucky ZBZ paid
for an open bar.

34:29.359 --> 34:32.652
Hey, trip, you're lucky you ever got
into omega chi in the first place.

34:38.239 --> 34:40.056
Looks like you need a drink
as badly as I do.

34:41.523 --> 34:43.281
Oh, I am the talk of the party.

34:43.556 --> 34:46.337
I didn't know how good I had it when
people were nice to me because of

34:46.462 --> 34:47.333
my last name.

34:47.799 --> 34:51.431
I don't even think i'd be omega chi
president if I weren't a chambers.

34:51.764 --> 34:53.857
You have to give yourself
more credit.

34:53.982 --> 34:57.761
And if it makes you feel any better, ZBZ
is going to be more broke than you are

34:57.929 --> 35:00.909
by the end of this party.
What was ashleigh thinking?

35:01.827 --> 35:06.118
She was thinking about how it feel being
president who's losing control of house

35:07.048 --> 35:08.225
Take it from me,

35:08.545 --> 35:10.375
it can make you do some really
crazy things.

35:10.500 --> 35:14.080
But it's the responsibility of
the president to have a cool head

35:14.205 --> 35:16.155
and to do what's best for the house

35:16.323 --> 35:18.824
But you're forgetting how it feels
to have that much responsibility.

35:19.337 --> 35:22.446
Especially in a crisis when
it's your ass on the line.

35:23.288 --> 35:27.458
I guess I'm still trying to figure out
how to be the president's best friend.

35:32.369 --> 35:33.328
Cheers to that.

35:41.215 --> 35:43.292
I just love caricatures, don't you?

35:43.626 --> 35:47.352
Oh, my god, I totally love caricatures!
I knew it was a good idea!

35:48.720 --> 35:50.332
Can I talk with you for a minute?

35:50.623 --> 35:51.611
Not right now.

35:52.177 --> 35:55.573
Natalie and I were just talking about
how much we love caricatures.

35:55.698 --> 35:58.781
Yes. But you two talk.
We're leaving now anyway.

35:59.393 --> 36:01.366
- Leaving?
- But it's 10:30.

36:01.534 --> 36:03.535
We said we'd come,
not that we'd stay.

36:05.163 --> 36:07.065
Thanks again for paying
our electric bill!

36:09.127 --> 36:10.929
Oops! That was loud.

36:14.256 --> 36:16.298
You paid the gamma psis
to come to this party?

36:18.176 --> 36:21.328
This is pathetic. I knew we shouldn't
have gotten involved with this party.

36:21.938 --> 36:22.912
Come on, guys.

36:24.205 --> 36:24.989
<i>Nice job.</i>

36:28.053 --> 36:29.113
Should we take off?

36:29.564 --> 36:30.854
This is kind of a disaster.

36:32.048 --> 36:33.565
So you're on trip's side?

36:34.009 --> 36:35.611
It's cool. We can stay.

36:40.991 --> 36:43.898
I may not have money anymore, Trip,
but I am still your president.

36:44.247 --> 36:47.037
You may not be for long. You're turning
omega chi into a joke.

36:47.470 --> 36:51.500
First by being dumb enough to give away
your trust fund, and now this slag-fest.

36:58.475 --> 37:00.217
Well, I guess it can't get
any worse.

37:01.803 --> 37:03.080
Smile for the yearbook.

37:19.007 --> 37:20.756
What the hell were you thinking?

37:20.881 --> 37:22.107
You kissed my boyfriend!

37:22.232 --> 37:24.700
That is not gonna work anymore.
We're really screwed.

37:25.074 --> 37:27.494
How could you let us
be humiliated like this?

37:27.896 --> 37:29.246
I know it looks bad...

37:29.414 --> 37:32.943
Forget number four we'll be lucky
if we're top ten after this. And since

37:33.068 --> 37:36.438
you spent all our money on this supid
party, we have no way of getting back up

37:36.563 --> 37:39.965
Give me one good reason why all of us
pledges shouldn't de-pledgeright now.

37:40.253 --> 37:40.921
I...

37:43.587 --> 37:44.356
I can't.

37:46.463 --> 37:49.281
How can we have any faith in you
as our president?

37:50.996 --> 37:52.884
Because she didn't know
anything about it.

37:54.273 --> 37:55.147
I did it.

37:55.315 --> 37:56.466
It's my fault.

37:56.591 --> 38:02.074
I panicked and I offered to
pay gamma psi's electric bill.

38:02.199 --> 38:04.239
Ashleigh didn't even know about it.

38:04.740 --> 38:08.285
No, it's true. She's just covering for
me, because she's a good friend.

38:08.453 --> 38:09.432
That's not true.

38:09.557 --> 38:13.540
Ashleigh is the best president
we've ever had.

38:14.008 --> 38:16.445
We need to rally behind her,
and move on.

38:22.169 --> 38:24.711
So you slipped on a wet dollar bill
and fell.

38:25.254 --> 38:27.872
You're still rowdy Rusty,
standing up to viper like that.

38:28.537 --> 38:30.397
Yeah. And I got up after I fell!

38:30.522 --> 38:32.100
Yeah, but then you fell down again.

38:32.268 --> 38:34.028
Why was that dollar bill wet?

38:37.036 --> 38:40.580
Have you thought about pledging
the JC House? Let me tell you about him

38:41.016 --> 38:45.592
Hey, if I can stand up to a guy named
viper, you can break up with lana.

38:46.933 --> 38:47.718
Maturely.

38:49.824 --> 38:51.328
It's not gonna kill you.

38:54.357 --> 38:55.619
Viper didn't kill me!

38:56.244 --> 38:57.624
<i>Jesus knows how to party.</i>

38:57.972 --> 38:59.294
<i>Dude makes his own wine.</i>

39:03.202 --> 39:05.396
Come on. Let's get you cleaned up.

39:08.329 --> 39:12.585
I guess I should explain why
I've been blowing you off.

39:14.111 --> 39:14.895
Whatever.

39:15.520 --> 39:16.812
We were just hanging out.

39:19.298 --> 39:20.941
Are we still, or not?

39:25.269 --> 39:26.280
I guess not.

39:26.577 --> 39:30.243
I thought this was what I wanted,
but I want, um, I want

39:30.368 --> 39:31.660
someone... Different.

39:34.282 --> 39:36.039
All you college guys are the same.

39:36.650 --> 39:41.670
Hook up with a hot townie for a while
before you realize you can't handle it.

39:43.730 --> 39:44.806
Something like that.

40:00.631 --> 40:03.232
Why do you care if I'm ok?
I'm the jerk that tried to

40:03.357 --> 40:05.440
mess with your relationship
to benefit my presidency.

40:06.472 --> 40:07.939
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

40:08.186 --> 40:11.584
- I know you're feeling lot of pressure.
- Maybe I should just resigne

40:11.709 --> 40:14.536
- before trip starts his coup.
- Don't give that jackass what he wants.

40:14.704 --> 40:17.061
There's plenty of other guys in
the house that have your back.

40:17.186 --> 40:18.107
Like me

40:18.659 --> 40:21.134
Thanks man
And please know that when you do decide

40:21.259 --> 40:23.590
to tell the house about grant,
I've got your back too.

40:23.715 --> 40:26.436
I'm not sure that i'm going to be
telling the house anytime soon.

40:26.561 --> 40:29.565
- What do you mean?
- I mean I'm starting to wonder

40:29.690 --> 40:31.428
if he's the right guy for me.

40:34.766 --> 40:36.683
- Pizza?
- I'm buying.

40:55.010 --> 40:56.783
It really does make
your nose tingle.

40:57.945 --> 41:00.415
I think I'm sticking with
sparkling cider for a while.

41:00.674 --> 41:02.084
Rowdy rusty's retiring.

41:02.252 --> 41:04.628
He was too easily influenced by
hot naked ladies anyway.

41:04.796 --> 41:08.067
And he made me behave like a grown-up
more than i'm comfortable with.

41:08.192 --> 41:09.811
I can't handle rowdy rusty.

41:09.936 --> 41:11.593
Let's just give the nicknames
a rest.

41:12.120 --> 41:13.675
now that you're acting all mature.

41:13.800 --> 41:15.847
Shut your damn mouth...
Again.

41:16.261 --> 41:17.837
- slightly more mature.
- Thank you.

41:17.962 --> 41:20.336
Now will you tell me? Why did
you go to gentleman's choice?

41:20.461 --> 41:22.849
I like the lukewarm taco meat.

41:22.974 --> 41:23.866
Come on.

41:23.991 --> 41:25.232
Don't read into it,

41:25.682 --> 41:27.716
You only go there when you're
thinking about a girl.

41:27.841 --> 41:29.273
Last time it was...

41:34.784 --> 41:36.368
I think I see where this is headed.

41:37.994 --> 41:39.446
Don't read into it, dale.

41:39.571 --> 41:41.582
Come on, let's just do another shot

42:04.856 --> 42:07.152
That was the longest night
of my life.

42:08.125 --> 42:12.154
They kept us up talking about the state
of the house until four in the morning.

42:12.322 --> 42:13.613
Girls talk a lot.

42:15.325 --> 42:16.317
Should we get up?

42:16.579 --> 42:18.076
I'm scared to leave this room.

42:18.380 --> 42:19.813
I'm just gonna resign.

42:19.938 --> 42:23.304
There's no reason you should take the
fall for me being a terrible president.

42:24.263 --> 42:25.396
You can't resign.

42:25.521 --> 42:29.914
Don't say it. Don't say that I souldn't
resign because i'm a great president.

42:30.394 --> 42:32.757
I wasn't going to say that
you're a great president.

42:33.551 --> 42:36.864
I was going to say that you can't resign
because that would only lead to further

42:36.989 --> 42:40.640
instability. Which we cannot have. We'd
be playing right into gamma psi's hands.

42:41.412 --> 42:42.327
You're right.

42:43.693 --> 42:45.437
And gamma psi seemed so nice.

42:46.017 --> 42:48.226
With their cupcakes and their
bunny mascot.

42:48.351 --> 42:52.333
Bunnies look cute, then they bite you
with their big sharp bunny teeth.

42:53.277 --> 42:54.919
And they sleep where they poop.

42:55.805 --> 42:57.282
You can't trust a bunny.

42:58.246 --> 42:59.451
So what are we gonna do?

42:59.916 --> 43:01.950
You won't mind taking my advice?

43:02.581 --> 43:03.642
Are you kidding?

43:05.080 --> 43:07.167
Let's discuss the facts.

43:07.335 --> 43:10.545
Gamma psi targeting us for
humiliation is a good thing.

43:10.713 --> 43:13.381
They wouldn't need to destroy us if they
didn't think of us as a threat.

43:14.467 --> 43:16.843
- We're still in the game.
- We're still in the game.

43:17.259 --> 43:18.720
So let's go start playing.

43:22.896 --> 43:25.082
I'm gonna eat a frowny-face
cupcake for breakfast.
