00:00.834 --> 00:03.002
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:31.498 --> 00:34.600
MIKE: Come on, guys.
We got a new message.

00:34.602 --> 00:37.603
Hey, what the hell?
We got a new message.

00:37.605 --> 00:38.837
"Is Magic real?"

00:38.839 --> 00:41.573
Signed, an Old Wizard.

00:41.575 --> 00:45.110
PIGEON: Hmm.
A wizard who's lost
his faith in magic.

00:45.112 --> 00:46.445
That's ironic.

00:46.946 --> 00:48.580
Ironic and sad.

00:48.582 --> 00:50.182
You guys believe in
magic, right?

00:50.184 --> 00:51.683
PIGEON: No.
MARQUESS: No, not really.

00:51.685 --> 00:54.319
But you're a ghost.
I think you're kind of magic.

00:54.321 --> 00:57.022
Mmm...
No, sorry, I just don't.

00:57.024 --> 00:59.024
I've always been a
man of reason.

00:59.026 --> 01:01.860
Come on, man, what about you?
You were turned into a pigeon
by a witch.

01:01.862 --> 01:04.029
Well, slow down, there.

01:04.031 --> 01:07.299
Sandra said she was gonna
turn me into a pigeon if I
cheated on her one more time.

01:07.301 --> 01:09.601
I, of course, immediately
cheated on her.

01:09.603 --> 01:10.803
But then, you know what?

01:10.805 --> 01:13.038
I think I would have just,
uh, transformed...

01:13.040 --> 01:15.908
into a pigeon on my own.

01:15.910 --> 01:17.810
Like, I think it would, uh...

01:17.812 --> 01:20.679
You know.
What's gonna happen's
gonna happen.

01:20.681 --> 01:23.348
Nope, there's no magic in
this world, my friend.

01:23.350 --> 01:25.317
Yung, you believe
in magic, right?

01:25.319 --> 01:27.653
I believe in the magic
of hard work.

01:27.655 --> 01:28.954
The magic of hard work?

01:28.956 --> 01:31.390
That's the most depressing
thing I've ever heard.

01:31.392 --> 01:35.027
Are the only ones left
that believe in magic me
and this Old Wizard?

01:35.029 --> 01:36.628
Well, you can't include him.

01:36.630 --> 01:40.065
Clearly he's not sure,
or he wouldn't be asking
the question.

01:40.067 --> 01:41.934
(GASPS)

01:41.936 --> 01:44.570
All of you cold-hearted
skepticalities is causing
a flight or...

01:44.572 --> 01:47.406
-fight feeling in my body.
-What?

01:47.408 --> 01:49.575
All of you cold-hearted
skepticalities

01:49.577 --> 01:52.411
is causing a fight or
flight feeling in my body.

01:52.413 --> 01:54.213
Oh, uh... still what.

01:54.215 --> 01:56.348
To the Mystery Mobile!

01:56.350 --> 01:58.250
PIGEON: No. No.
No, no, no!

01:58.252 --> 02:00.619
Don't close the blinds.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.855
YUNG: Dad!
MARQUESS: Michael!

02:02.857 --> 02:04.990
MARQUESS: Slow down!
MIKE: It's fight or flight,
Marquess, and I'm flighty.

02:04.992 --> 02:08.026
We gotta find out
once and for all, is there
magic in this world,

02:08.028 --> 02:10.329
and then find the Old Wizard
and tell him.

02:10.331 --> 02:15.033
And then, and only then,
will this fight or flight
feeling leave.

02:15.035 --> 02:16.435
And go away.

02:16.437 --> 02:18.403
PIGEON: Why do you care
about magic so much?

02:18.405 --> 02:20.305
I have been through
some real hard times,

02:20.307 --> 02:23.842
and to get through them,
I believe that there
is something out there.

02:23.844 --> 02:26.745
Like, um, someone
had a plan for me.

02:27.580 --> 02:29.615
That my life had a purpose.

02:29.617 --> 02:32.618
-You mean, like, God?
-No, not that fairytale
stuff, honey.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.219
I'm talking about leprechauns.

02:34.221 --> 02:36.121
-Oh, my.
-That's right.

02:36.123 --> 02:39.324
I once saw a real live
leprechaun, while visiting
the Emerald Isles.

02:39.326 --> 02:42.027
If he exists, then
that proves that magic exists.

02:42.029 --> 02:43.362
To the Mystery Mobile!

02:43.364 --> 02:44.796
We're in the
Mystery Mobile, Dad.

02:44.798 --> 02:47.032
Are we really going
to Ireland?

02:47.034 --> 02:50.369
No.
The Emerald Isle Bar and Grill
inside the Camelot Hotel.

02:50.371 --> 02:52.237
You can't drive to Ireland,
Marquess.

02:55.141 --> 02:56.708
Where's the Emerald Isle at?

02:56.710 --> 02:59.978
Wait! Why don't you ask him?
Isn't he a magician?

02:59.980 --> 03:02.781
No way.
He doesn't do magic.
He does illusions.

03:02.783 --> 03:04.583
Like, I got your nose
or something.

03:04.585 --> 03:07.119
It's okay, Marquess.
It's okay.
I don't have your nose.

03:07.121 --> 03:08.754
It's just my thumb tip.

03:08.756 --> 03:10.889
MIKE: It's just an illusion.
MARQUESS:
Yeah, I wasn't worried.

03:10.891 --> 03:12.858
It's just a mean thing to
do to kids, okay?

03:12.860 --> 03:15.294
MARQUESS: Michael. Michael!
YUNG: Dad,
where are you going?

03:15.296 --> 03:17.196
-Stop abusing kids!
-(CROWD GASPING)

03:17.198 --> 03:19.798
-Oh, my... Michael!
-YUNG: Dad!

03:19.800 --> 03:21.967
-The Emerald Isle!
-Michael, stop running away.

03:21.969 --> 03:25.704
I was here one time,
and the whole place was
decorated in green.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.806
And everyone here was
wearing green.

03:27.808 --> 03:30.742
And the beer was green.
And it was crazy how
everything was green.

03:30.744 --> 03:32.711
I think it was Valentine's Day
or something.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.980
And you were here.
And you were a leprechaun.

03:34.982 --> 03:36.515
Saint Patrick's Day.

03:36.517 --> 03:39.117
They make me put on costume.
For joke.

03:39.119 --> 03:40.452
It was a costume?

03:40.454 --> 03:42.087
You're not a leprechaun?

03:42.089 --> 03:44.056
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

03:44.058 --> 03:45.591
There's no such thing.

03:45.593 --> 03:47.559
MAN:
You want some rose?

03:51.631 --> 03:53.932
MIKE: I guess since
that guy wasn't a leprechaun,

03:53.934 --> 03:56.635
there really isn't no magic
in this world, huh?

03:56.637 --> 03:59.938
I don't know how we're
gonna ever break this to the
Old Wizard who sent the note.

03:59.940 --> 04:02.708
I don't know how we're ever
gonna find the Old Wizard
who sent the note.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.276
PIGEON: Well, you know
what I don't know?

04:04.278 --> 04:06.745
Is why we're doing any of it.
Ever.

04:08.414 --> 04:11.416
Lost ticket pay's max,
lords and ladies.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.986
-You're the Old Wizard!
-You got my note!

04:13.988 --> 04:18.023
No way! The chances
that we run into you, man...
Aw, it gots to be magic.

04:18.025 --> 04:21.193
I... I wrote on the note
exactly where to find me.

04:21.195 --> 04:25.097
"You can find me
in the parking garage of
the Camelot Hotel."

04:25.099 --> 04:26.465
Damn.

04:26.467 --> 04:28.367
-Not magic.
-(CAR HONKING)

04:28.369 --> 04:30.302
Why... Why don't we
go somewhere else and hear
this wizard's story?

04:30.304 --> 04:33.005
(GASPING)
I know his story.

04:33.007 --> 04:35.774
MIKE: <i> He's not a wizard.</i>
<i>He's a professional gambler.</i>

04:35.776 --> 04:38.477
<i>His nickname was the Wizard</i>
<i>because of his beard.</i>

04:38.479 --> 04:40.445
<i>They also call him</i>
<i>"That ZZ Top Guy,"</i>

04:40.447 --> 04:43.815
<i>but the Wizard was</i>
<i>more appropriate, because</i>
<i>he was like magic.</i>

04:43.817 --> 04:47.552
<i>How he always seemed to know</i>
<i>what card was next.</i>

04:47.554 --> 04:49.888
Hit me.

04:49.890 --> 04:52.624
MIKE: <i> The Wizard got</i>
<i>the second greatest</i>
<i>hot streak of all time.</i>

04:52.626 --> 04:55.761
<i>The first was by another guy</i>
<i>that we're not gonna</i>
<i>talk about right now.</i>

04:55.763 --> 04:59.331
<i>Then, out of nowhere,</i>
<i>the casino lights shut down.</i>

04:59.333 --> 05:01.867
What are you assholes doing?

05:01.869 --> 05:04.569
MIKE: <i> They said</i>
<i>the Wizard was cheating,</i>
<i>and banned him forever,</i>

05:04.571 --> 05:08.940
<i>and forced him to pay back</i>
<i>his winnings by working</i>
<i>here for $5 an hour.</i>

05:08.942 --> 05:11.543
-(CARS HONKING)
-How could I possibly
know all that?

05:11.545 --> 05:14.513
-It's magic!
-No. That was also
on the note.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.014
-Flip it open there.
-(HONKING CONTINUES)

05:16.016 --> 05:18.050
MARQUESS:
Michael, they're honking.

05:18.052 --> 05:20.619
It's like a comic book.
It got a bunch of
drawings and stuff.

05:20.621 --> 05:22.854
OLD WIZARD:
Well, I was worried
you might be illiterate.

05:22.856 --> 05:24.690
I wasn't cheating and
it wasn't luck.

05:24.692 --> 05:26.391
I felt it.
It was magic.

05:26.393 --> 05:28.260
There is no other explanation.

05:28.262 --> 05:31.463
But then they banned me
and I haven't felt it since.

05:31.465 --> 05:35.133
Gang, we gotta get the Wizard
gambling again to prove,
once and for all,

05:35.135 --> 05:36.735
that magic is real!

05:36.737 --> 05:39.004
Well, if he's banned
from the casino,
how can he gamble again?

05:39.006 --> 05:41.373
I know a game,
a little more private.

05:41.375 --> 05:44.076
MARQUESS: Okay, if we're
gonna keep talking,
we should get out of line.

05:44.078 --> 05:46.211
-The one at the Sahara?
-Oh, no, I'm banned
from that one.

05:46.213 --> 05:48.480
-The one at Imperial?
-MARQUESS:
This is just insensitive.

05:48.482 --> 05:50.949
PIGEON: No. A bunch of guys
got stabbed at that one.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.617
-(HONKING CONTINUES)
-The one at the Mandalay Bay?

05:52.619 --> 05:54.553
PIGEON: There isn't one
at Mandalay Bay.

05:54.555 --> 05:56.321
And...
stop guessing!

05:56.323 --> 05:59.224
-I could have told you
where it was 45 minutes ago.
-(HONKING CONTINUES)

05:59.226 --> 06:03.895
Just pay the ticket and pull
out of here, and we can come
back and talk to this man.

06:03.897 --> 06:05.697
-The one at Camelot?
-(HONKING CONTINUES)

06:05.699 --> 06:07.566
-Stop honking!
-Mike, Mike, Mike!

06:07.568 --> 06:09.401
-Dad, where are you going?
-MARQUESS: It's our fault!

06:09.403 --> 06:11.770
-MARQUESS: This is insanity.
-WOMAN:
Get your car out of there!

06:11.772 --> 06:13.472
I gotta take him to
the hospital!

06:13.474 --> 06:15.707
How was I supposed
to know you had to go to
the hospital, you idiot?

06:15.709 --> 06:18.443
Why the hell does it
take you an hour to get out
of the parking garage?

06:18.445 --> 06:20.379
MIKE: Cause I was
having a conversation
with a wizard!

06:20.381 --> 06:22.247
MARQUESS:
Oh, just get back in
the car, Michael.

06:22.249 --> 06:24.449
-(WOMAN YELLING)
-Michael, just get back
in the car!

06:27.253 --> 06:29.721
Hey, Oleg.
Got a late add.

06:39.632 --> 06:41.433
What's the buy-in?

06:41.435 --> 06:43.201
PIGEON: A million.
Mike'll stake you.

06:43.203 --> 06:45.070
What? I don't have a
million dollars.

06:45.072 --> 06:48.340
In fact, I don't even think
I can afford to keep solving
mysteries, you guys.

06:48.342 --> 06:50.442
Huh.
Man, I gotta get a real job.

06:50.444 --> 06:53.745
-Not tonight, you don't.
-MARQUESS:
What are you talking about?

06:55.548 --> 06:59.484
-YUNG: (GROANING) Oh, God.
-MARQUESS:
Who is he talking to?

06:59.486 --> 07:01.219
MARQUESS:
Who is that?

07:01.221 --> 07:03.522
OLD WIZARD:
Is that Robert Redford?

07:05.391 --> 07:06.658
You're in.

07:11.564 --> 07:13.098
How the hell did you do that?

07:13.100 --> 07:15.333
Robert Redford's always
hanging out at these hotels

07:15.335 --> 07:17.936
offering people
a million dollars to sleep
with their wives.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.838
I told him he could
sleep with mine.

07:19.840 --> 07:23.642
I think I saw a movie about
that one time.
It starred Paul Newman.

07:23.644 --> 07:25.010
Wait a minute.
You're divorced.

07:25.012 --> 07:27.679
-I told him Yung Hee
was my wife.
-What?

07:27.681 --> 07:29.514
Yeah, relax, she's 18.

07:29.516 --> 07:32.684
She needs the experience.
(CHUCKLING)

07:37.423 --> 07:41.193
Oh, no, I got that
fight or flight feeling again
and I'm flighty!

MAN: Ow!
MIKE: Sorry, sir.
Come on, come on.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.999
(BLEEP) it.
Excuse me, fight or flight,
coming through.

Fight or flight is on his way!

ROBERT: What?
MIKE: Stop abusing kids!

08:01.281 --> 08:03.849
-Dad!
-You shouldn't sleep with
somebody for money.

08:03.851 --> 08:05.750
He didn't want to
sleep with me.

08:05.752 --> 08:08.753
He wants me to come to
the Sundance Institute and
study filmmaking.

08:08.755 --> 08:10.255
Then why are you
wearing that dress?

08:10.257 --> 08:12.624
This is the Sundance
Film Institute school uniform.

08:12.626 --> 08:14.459
They used to have
those varsity jackets,

08:14.461 --> 08:16.561
but Robert found out
the leather sleeves
weren't vegan leather,

08:16.563 --> 08:18.230
and so now everyone
at Sundance wears this.

08:18.232 --> 08:20.198
Then why would he give
the Pigeon a million dollars?

08:20.200 --> 08:22.968
Because there are
so few Asian American
female directors.

08:22.970 --> 08:25.070
He's desperate for us
to have our voices heard.

08:25.072 --> 08:27.038

is kind of like an angel, huh?

Was I seeing?

That we sense in the world.

09:34.841 --> 09:36.341
And when they rip out of us...

09:36.976 --> 09:38.543
we'll die.

09:38.545 --> 09:42.881
But are we really alive
if leprechauns
are controlling us?

09:44.850 --> 09:48.186
Well, maybe that's a film
you could make at Sundance,
Yung Hee.

09:48.188 --> 09:51.790
Explore the question of
what it's like for an
Asian American woman

09:51.792 --> 09:54.593
to have a leprechaun
inside of her.

09:54.595 --> 09:56.528
(PIGEON LAUGHING)

09:56.530 --> 09:59.531
Ah.
I'm sorry.

09:59.533 --> 10:02.334
I just...
Please, make that film.

10:02.336 --> 10:06.171
Because I think there
are a lot of people who want
to see what it's like

10:06.173 --> 10:10.275
for an Asian American
woman to have a
leprechaun inside of her.

10:10.277 --> 10:12.677
(LAUGHING)

10:13.613 --> 10:15.747
(CHUCKLING)

10:37.370 --> 10:39.371
Is this your card?

10:39.373 --> 10:42.374
All right.
I told you, magic do exist.
