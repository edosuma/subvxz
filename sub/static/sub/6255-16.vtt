WEBVTT

00:00.848 --> 00:03.811
We're gonna plant a fish?
I don't know about this, Kyle.

00:03.812 --> 00:06.381
Dude, the object is to win the
fishing tournament, isn't it?

00:06.415 --> 00:08.883
Some guys stuff lead weights
down the fish's throat.

00:08.917 --> 00:10.351
Me, I'm a purist.

00:10.386 --> 00:12.120
Yeah, I'm talking
about the morality part.

00:12.154 --> 00:15.423
We're evening out the odds.
That's very moral.

00:15.457 --> 00:17.458
So...

00:17.493 --> 00:20.228
let's figure out

00:20.262 --> 00:22.664
where we're gonna put this guy.

00:22.698 --> 00:24.399
All right.

00:24.433 --> 00:25.967
The boat slip's right here.

00:26.501 --> 00:28.669
We'll put him way out
in the lake

00:28.703 --> 00:31.672
so we'll be in the middle of the
tournament by the time he thaws.

00:31.706 --> 00:33.040
And then bingo.

00:33.074 --> 00:36.777
We come back
with an eight-and-a-half pounder

00:36.812 --> 00:38.879
and take home gold.

00:38.914 --> 00:40.948
What is that?

00:40.982 --> 00:43.384
That's probably a bag
of morality.

00:43.418 --> 00:45.886
You got to go see
what that is.

00:45.921 --> 00:49.256
Some jackass had
the same idea we did.

00:49.291 --> 00:52.259
(panting)

00:56.464 --> 00:58.799
(gasps)
What? Is it big?

00:58.834 --> 01:02.336
Yeah, but I don't think
it'll win the tournament.

01:04.172 --> 01:06.473
Yeah.
BRENNAN: That's your  third cup of coffee.

01:06.508 --> 01:08.242
I like the coffee here.

01:08.276 --> 01:10.311
One more reason why you're more
likely to die before I do.

01:10.345 --> 01:11.712
Whoa, whoa.

01:11.746 --> 01:14.181
Wait a second. Okay.
Let's just start...

01:14.216 --> 01:16.250
Take a step back, all right?
What are you talking about?

01:16.284 --> 01:18.285
You imbibe a higher level
of carcinogenic fluids,

01:18.320 --> 01:19.687
you've had a brain tumor,

01:19.721 --> 01:22.223
you're older than I am,
and you're a man.

01:22.257 --> 01:23.791
Therefore,
the insurance company is wrong.

01:23.825 --> 01:25.125
Wrong about what?
They want to charge

01:25.160 --> 01:27.194
more for my life insurance
than yours,

01:27.229 --> 01:29.763
even though
I will clearly outlive you.

01:29.798 --> 01:31.558
Okay, I'm glad you have a plan
to outlive me.

01:31.566 --> 01:33.267
I'm just being practical.
I'm sure they're being

01:33.301 --> 01:34.602
practical, too;
this is what they do.

01:34.636 --> 01:35.970
They've come
to the misguided

01:36.004 --> 01:38.138
conclusion that it is
more dangerous for me

01:38.173 --> 01:40.507
to spend time in the field
than for you.

01:40.542 --> 01:42.610
Without examining the evidence.
Well, they-they kind of have.

01:42.644 --> 01:44.378
You see, I'm trained
in the danger business.

01:44.412 --> 01:46.280
You're, you know...
you're top dog...

01:46.314 --> 01:47.982
(howls) in the lab.

01:48.016 --> 01:50.651
I'm licensed to carry a weapon,
I know martial arts...

01:50.685 --> 01:53.520
You shot me once.
A ricochet. That doesn't count.

01:53.555 --> 01:55.723
I'm sure it counts to them, okay?
Oh, so you agree with them

01:55.757 --> 01:57.758
and think that I should be penalized.
You know what, I'm not

01:57.792 --> 02:00.294
gonna win this discussion.
I mean, I just keep digging a...

02:00.328 --> 02:02.129
hole that's getting deeper and deep...
(phone ringing)

02:02.163 --> 02:03.497
Oh, look at that.
There is a God.

02:03.531 --> 02:05.499
Saved by a phone call. Booth.

02:05.533 --> 02:07.234
Yeah. Okay.

02:07.269 --> 02:09.110
Great. On our way.
Decomposed body in the lake.

02:09.137 --> 02:10.670
Let's go.

02:10.705 --> 02:12.773
I'm not done with this, Booth.
Look, this is not

02:12.807 --> 02:14.308
my fault, okay?

02:14.342 --> 02:16.143
I don't speak
for the life insurance company.

02:16.177 --> 02:17.945
I didn't just shoot you, Booth.
I saved your life, too.

02:17.979 --> 02:19.813
All right, look, if this
is so important to you,

02:19.848 --> 02:21.715
why don't you look for another
insurance company, you know?

02:21.750 --> 02:23.784
Shop around for better rates.
I will.

02:23.818 --> 02:25.486
Yeah. There you go. Good idea.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.955
All right, what's going on here
at the dock of the bay?

02:27.989 --> 02:30.024
Whoa.
A waterlogged corpse.

02:30.058 --> 02:31.625
How long has it been in there?

02:31.660 --> 02:33.021
Based on decomped
flesh underwater,

02:33.028 --> 02:34.528
I'd say it's
been in the bag

02:34.562 --> 02:35.963
approximately four days.

02:35.997 --> 02:37.364
There's got to be
some goodies in there

02:37.399 --> 02:38.966
that'll give us
a more precise time.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.368
Well, until you find
them, four days.

02:41.403 --> 02:42.736
Sharp supraorbital
margin, lack of

02:42.771 --> 02:43.938
prominence of the glabella

02:43.972 --> 02:45.739
indicate that
the victim is female.

02:45.774 --> 02:48.042
BOOTH: See, I could've looked at
that for hours and never

02:48.076 --> 02:49.376
have figured that out,
all right.

02:49.411 --> 02:50.511
All you need is
a little piece of bone

02:50.545 --> 02:52.179
and a beautiful
brain. Me?

02:52.213 --> 02:53.981
I just need a gun.
Don't patronize me, Booth.

02:54.015 --> 02:55.749
Am I missing something?
No.

02:55.784 --> 02:57.384
The insurance company believes
that I am more

02:57.419 --> 02:59.553
at risk than he is
when we're in the field.

02:59.587 --> 03:01.889
And Booth agrees with them.
Really? It's none of their concern.

03:01.923 --> 03:03.557
That doesn't seem right.
See?

03:03.591 --> 03:05.025
You see what you started now?
They're just looking

03:05.060 --> 03:06.160
at numbers. I mean,
Booth has more training

03:06.194 --> 03:07.027
and experience.

03:07.062 --> 03:08.295
Right. Exactly. S...

03:08.330 --> 03:09.897
Did you hear what he said here?

03:09.931 --> 03:12.066
Mr. Bug Boy said they're just
looking at numbers.

03:12.100 --> 03:14.435
I thought you didn't want to involve them.
SAROYAN: Glad you asked now?

03:14.469 --> 03:15.936
Someday I'll learn.

03:15.971 --> 03:17.271
There's clearly trauma
to the bones,

03:17.305 --> 03:21.408
but I need them cleaned
to determine cause.

03:22.711 --> 03:25.112
Hey, uh, if someone was
trying to hide this,

03:25.146 --> 03:27.281
wouldn't they
weigh down the bag?

03:27.315 --> 03:29.383
BOOTH: There's a tournament
scheduled for today.

03:29.417 --> 03:31.185
Well, all the more reason
to go deep.

03:31.219 --> 03:33.087
No, not if the killer wanted us
to find the body.

03:33.121 --> 03:35.022
Wow.

03:35.056 --> 03:36.490
Oh, be careful.

03:36.524 --> 03:38.125
Good. Bag on a gurney.
HODGINS: Careful, guys.

03:38.159 --> 03:40.394
I need this water.
Ooh, and that! OTHERS: Oh!

03:40.428 --> 03:42.429
Hey! Grab it! Get it,
get it, get it!

03:42.464 --> 03:43.931
Get it, get it,
get it! That thing.

03:43.965 --> 03:45.432
Geez!

03:45.467 --> 03:47.034
Okay, do not let that go, Booth.
That is evidence.

03:47.068 --> 03:48.669
Do not let it go, okay?
What is that?

03:48.703 --> 03:50.571
It's a lamprey. It will not bite.
Lamprey.

03:50.605 --> 03:51.370
Okay.

03:51.395 --> 03:53.240
Unless, of course, you let
the mouth near your skin.

03:53.241 --> 03:56.276
Well, it's on my skin. Get it off my skin.
Come on, come on. I need it in here.

03:56.311 --> 03:57.344
BRENNAN: I'd help,
but apparently I'm not

03:57.379 --> 03:58.979
as qualified as you
in field work.

03:59.014 --> 04:00.447
Booth!

04:01.383 --> 04:03.684
And now I got slime stuff on me.

04:34.106 --> 04:36.551
BRENNAN: Almost complete
ossification of

04:36.552 --> 04:38.419
the cranial sutures indicates

04:38.454 --> 04:39.854
that the victim
was in her late 20s.

04:39.888 --> 04:41.289
The skull's in good shape.

04:41.323 --> 04:42.857
Angela's reconstruction
should be pretty simple.

04:42.891 --> 04:45.159
The victim is Caucasian.

04:45.194 --> 04:46.861
I do not concur.
Really?

04:46.895 --> 04:49.664
Racial identification
is basic stuff. What did I miss?

04:49.698 --> 04:52.400
The sharp nasal sill
and the angle

04:52.434 --> 04:55.103
of the anterior
nasal spine

04:55.137 --> 04:57.338
indicates the victim
was Caucasian.

04:57.372 --> 04:59.173
Uh, that's what Ms. Wick said.

04:59.208 --> 05:01.242
The issue is her
projecting zygomatics

05:01.276 --> 05:04.312
and the wide interorbital space.

05:04.346 --> 05:06.581
Asian?
There's no single ethnicity

05:06.615 --> 05:08.716
because the victim is
from a polyethnic crossroads.

05:08.751 --> 05:11.886
Somewhere along the ancient
trade routes that ran between

05:11.920 --> 05:13.888
Northern Asia and the Caucasus.

05:13.922 --> 05:15.857
I'm sorry. I'm just tired.

05:15.891 --> 05:18.025
I've been studying for my orals.

05:18.060 --> 05:19.694
I thought you already took them.

05:19.728 --> 05:20.862
They were rescheduled.

05:20.896 --> 05:22.029
I would place victim's

05:22.064 --> 05:24.232
ethnic origins in the Stans--

05:24.266 --> 05:25.733
Waziristan,
Kyrgyzstan,

05:25.768 --> 05:27.902
Afghanistan.
Better.

05:27.936 --> 05:28.936
The skin is in pieces.

05:28.971 --> 05:30.138
(groans)

05:31.907 --> 05:34.709
Hodgins' lampreys
did some good work on this.

05:34.743 --> 05:36.711
Who would throw lampreys
in with a body?

05:36.745 --> 05:39.013
I'm not supposed
to know that, am I?

05:41.583 --> 05:44.385
What am I supposed to do, okay?
Bones is all upset.

05:44.419 --> 05:46.420
Am I supposed to start my own
life insurance company?

05:46.455 --> 05:48.322
Dr. Brennan's always
seen herself as someone

05:48.357 --> 05:49.490
who's capable of doing anything

05:49.525 --> 05:51.659
if she puts her mind
to it. Now this...

05:51.693 --> 05:54.730
empirical assessment's telling her she's
not as exceptional as she thought.

05:54.731 --> 05:56.063
That's not an answer.
How do I fix this?

05:56.064 --> 05:57.799
Start your own
insurance company.

05:57.833 --> 05:59.167
Sometimes you can be
really useless.

05:59.201 --> 06:02.036
Are you gonna be helpful
at all in this case?

06:02.070 --> 06:05.540
I know you're frustrated, so I'm
not gonna take that personally.

06:05.574 --> 06:07.375
Based on the crime scene,
I don't think

06:07.409 --> 06:09.477
this is the work
of a sexual predator.

06:09.511 --> 06:11.412
They typically like to leave
a bit of a calling card behind.

06:11.446 --> 06:13.481
What about the eels?

06:13.515 --> 06:15.516
Okay, those are very phallic,
obviously.

06:15.551 --> 06:17.351
But it's atypical.

06:17.386 --> 06:18.553
I think they're symbolic
of something else.

06:18.587 --> 06:20.021
All right. What?

06:20.055 --> 06:22.223
I don't know yet.
But we're looking for

06:22.257 --> 06:26.394
someone who is obviously trying
to send a message.

06:28.564 --> 06:30.264
You wanted to see me, Ms. Wick?

06:30.299 --> 06:31.432
Yes, Dr. Brennan.

06:31.466 --> 06:33.034
I completed
a preliminary examination

06:33.068 --> 06:35.069
of the victim's
entire skeleton,

06:35.103 --> 06:37.505
and I found a remodeled fracture
on the left humerus.

06:37.539 --> 06:39.874
Do you have the X-rays? I'd like to see...
I do indeed.

06:42.444 --> 06:43.978
It appears the victim

06:44.012 --> 06:46.480
suffered a severe break
approximately two years ago.

06:46.515 --> 06:47.849
Three.

06:47.883 --> 06:49.183
Of course.

06:49.218 --> 06:50.818
Did you also note
that it appears a pin

06:50.853 --> 06:54.121
was inserted to help the
fracture set properly?

06:54.156 --> 06:55.423
I should have seen that.

06:55.457 --> 06:57.058
That is correct.
You should have.

06:57.092 --> 06:59.694
We need to look
at the humerus more closely.

07:07.269 --> 07:09.470
(whirring, beeping)

07:10.806 --> 07:13.307
Angela should be able
to identify the victim

07:13.342 --> 07:16.010
from this serial number.

07:16.044 --> 07:17.879
Can you extract it
and take it to her?

07:17.913 --> 07:20.081
I hope so.
Are you sure there isn't something

07:20.115 --> 07:21.749
on your mind, Ms. Wick?
No.

07:21.783 --> 07:23.050
No, no.

07:27.055 --> 07:30.691
Apparently nothing
in this mind at all.

07:30.726 --> 07:33.194
HODGINS: Did you know
these guys haven't evolved

07:33.228 --> 07:35.029
in 360 million years?

07:35.063 --> 07:37.999
Sounds like they could run
for Congress.

07:38.033 --> 07:40.268
Look at them, just
doing what they do best.

07:40.302 --> 07:42.770
Relaxing and watching
life go by.

07:42.804 --> 07:44.739
And this is helping how?

07:44.773 --> 07:46.574
Well, the lampreys were
feeding on the corpse,

07:46.608 --> 07:48.976
which means they've ingested
all sorts of useful stuff.

07:49.011 --> 07:50.945
So I am waiting
for them to make.

07:50.979 --> 07:52.513
"Make"?

07:52.547 --> 07:54.815
Oh, sorry. That's what
we call it with Michael Vincent.

07:54.850 --> 07:56.851
Although, unlike him,
their digestive tract

07:56.885 --> 07:58.319
goes directly
from mouth to anus.

07:58.353 --> 08:00.588
I'm sure that's not
the only difference.

08:00.622 --> 08:03.190
Why don't you
just cut them open?

08:03.225 --> 08:05.192
After 360 million years, I think

08:05.227 --> 08:07.728
they deserve a bit more respect
than that.

08:07.763 --> 08:09.497
Ooh, look at that.
I think he's making.

08:09.531 --> 08:11.432
Uh, excreting.

08:11.466 --> 08:13.901
Don't you want to see this?
Nope.

08:13.936 --> 08:15.770
This is evidence.
Bye-bye!

08:15.804 --> 08:17.471
Oh, Cam,

08:17.506 --> 08:20.508
the pin that Dr. Brennan found
in the victim's humerus

08:20.542 --> 08:22.843
was part of a shipment
of medical devices

08:22.878 --> 08:24.312
that was sent
to Afghanistan.

08:24.346 --> 08:26.480
Dr. Brennan said
the victim came from

08:26.515 --> 08:27.682
that part of the world.

08:27.716 --> 08:29.750
And Daisy was right
about the Stans.

08:29.785 --> 08:32.153
The victim was originally
from Afghanistan.

08:32.187 --> 08:34.956
Her name was Sari Nazeri.

08:34.990 --> 08:37.390
Poor thing.
She was only 28.

08:37.426 --> 08:38.826
MONTENEGRO:
She immigrated to the U.S.

08:38.860 --> 08:40.126
a year ago with
her brother.

08:40.162 --> 08:41.996
She was a teacher's
aide, and he did

08:42.030 --> 08:44.298
odd jobs--
landscaping and carpentry.

08:44.333 --> 08:46.167
They were granted
political asylum.

08:46.201 --> 08:47.268
Well, she deserved it.

08:47.302 --> 08:48.970
She helped
American forces

08:49.004 --> 08:50.271
locate terrorists

08:50.305 --> 08:52.707
and made some videos
about her experience.

08:52.741 --> 08:55.142
Did I know that
my actions would mean

08:55.177 --> 08:58.045
I could never
go back to my home?

08:58.080 --> 08:59.914
No.

08:59.948 --> 09:02.049
But I don't regret anything.

09:02.084 --> 09:05.286
Here, I can tell
the world the truth.

09:05.320 --> 09:07.788
Here, I can work
to make sure any girl

09:07.823 --> 09:09.790
can get access to education

09:09.825 --> 09:12.159
without fear of retribution.

09:12.194 --> 09:14.128
Here, I can...

09:14.162 --> 09:16.597
speak about the freedom
that can bring light

09:16.631 --> 09:20.768
to a part of the world that
has been dark for too long.

09:20.802 --> 09:25.006
No sacrifice is too great
to make that happen.

09:25.040 --> 09:27.341
And we couldn't even
keep her safe.

09:27.376 --> 09:29.076
(knocking)

09:30.846 --> 09:32.813
FBI. Special Agent
Seeley Booth.

09:32.848 --> 09:35.149
This here is my partner,
Dr. Temperance Brennan.

09:35.183 --> 09:37.752
Are you, uh,
Aziz Nazeri?

09:37.786 --> 09:39.186
Is this about Sari?

09:39.221 --> 09:40.521
Yes.

09:40.555 --> 09:42.056
(speaks Pashto)

09:42.090 --> 09:44.892
(speaks Pashto)

09:44.926 --> 09:47.595
MAN: It's okay, Aziz.
Let them in.

09:49.431 --> 09:51.298
Danny?
Hey, Seeley.

09:51.333 --> 09:53.434
Can't say I'm
happy to see you.

09:53.468 --> 09:54.702
Wait, y-you know them?

09:54.736 --> 09:56.003
Yes. They're
with the FBI.

09:56.038 --> 09:57.605
What are you
doing here?

09:57.639 --> 09:59.040
Long story.

09:59.074 --> 10:01.909
But you can only be here
for one reason, so...

10:01.943 --> 10:04.078
do what you
came to do.

10:05.047 --> 10:07.081
Will they help
find my sister?

10:07.115 --> 10:09.183
Unfortunately,
we have.

10:09.217 --> 10:10.384
I don't understand.

10:10.419 --> 10:11.652
BRENNAN:
Your sister is dead,

10:11.686 --> 10:12.920
Mr. Nazeri.

10:12.954 --> 10:14.288
We're very sorry.

10:15.757 --> 10:18.559
How could this happen?

10:18.593 --> 10:19.760
Huh?

10:19.795 --> 10:21.028
How could you let
this happen?

10:21.063 --> 10:23.030
How could you
let this happen?

10:23.065 --> 10:26.300
Maybe it's time you tell us
about that long story, Danny.

10:27.779 --> 10:30.046
When Aziz came home last Friday,
Sari was gone.

10:31.076 --> 10:33.844
I tried to call, but her
cell phone was disconnected.

10:33.879 --> 10:35.579
Why didn't you file
a missing persons report?

10:35.614 --> 10:37.181
It's sensitive.

10:37.215 --> 10:38.516
It's murder.
There's always more

10:38.550 --> 10:39.950
when the CIA's involved, so...

10:39.985 --> 10:41.685
you want to tell me that
long story now, Danny?

10:41.720 --> 10:43.654
Hey, you were
supposed to protect us.

10:43.688 --> 10:45.969
Hey, I'm gonna get to the bottom
of this, Aziz, I promise.

10:45.991 --> 10:47.231
BRENNAN:
The CIA isn't empowered

10:47.278 --> 10:49.008
to investigate crimes
on U.S. soil.

10:49.009 --> 10:50.209
This is Booth's jurisdiction.

10:50.243 --> 10:52.324
Thank you, Bones.
So, Mr. Nazeri,

10:52.325 --> 10:54.092
did Sari have any
problems around here?

10:54.127 --> 10:55.961
Did anybody come around
and threaten her recently?

10:55.995 --> 10:57.186
She was an asset, Seeley.

10:57.211 --> 10:58.997
You know how this works.
It was Ibrahim.

10:58.998 --> 11:01.633
Ibrahim is dead, Aziz.
Okay, somebody want to fill me in here?

11:01.667 --> 11:04.736
Who's Ibrahim?
Look, this has to stay quiet.

11:04.771 --> 11:08.373
Ibrahim Sajadi. An engineer.
He made bombs for al-Qaeda.

11:08.408 --> 11:10.375
He was a CIA target
in Afghanistan.

11:10.410 --> 11:12.144
It was your job to kill him?

11:12.178 --> 11:14.246
That's what you do, isn't it?

11:19.652 --> 11:21.887
Ibrahim was a high value target.

11:21.921 --> 11:23.488
We knew he was in Ghazni,

11:23.523 --> 11:25.490
but we didn't have
operatives on the ground.

11:25.525 --> 11:27.559
Sari identified where he
lived-- they were from

11:27.593 --> 11:29.928
the same village.
She was working for you over there?

11:29.962 --> 11:31.296
I recruited her, yes.

11:31.330 --> 11:32.898
She planted the transponder
in his house

11:32.932 --> 11:34.773
for the drone strike;
she was incredibly brave.

11:34.801 --> 11:36.268
She got injured
by the explosion.

11:36.302 --> 11:38.503
AZIZ: Yeah, too brave.
And too stupid to trust you.

11:38.538 --> 11:39.923
Now she's dead.

11:39.948 --> 11:41.306
Hey, I took care of her
when she was hurt, Aziz.

11:41.307 --> 11:43.141
I got you both
out of the country.

11:43.176 --> 11:44.409
I did everything I promised.

11:44.444 --> 11:46.411
No, you promised us a good life!

11:50.716 --> 11:53.452
BOOTH: <i>Look, you can't hold</i>
<i>anything back, Danny, okay?</i>

11:53.486 --> 11:55.120
This is my jurisdiction,
it's my case.

11:55.154 --> 11:56.955
Hey, we put a lot
of time into this.

11:56.989 --> 11:58.723
There are people above me,
we have operatives...

11:58.758 --> 12:01.526
Yeah, but it's not gonna
work like that here, James Bond,

12:01.561 --> 12:03.728
because I'm representing
the Justice Department

12:03.763 --> 12:05.263
to make sure you obey the law.

12:05.298 --> 12:07.232
So, Booth is your boss
on this case,

12:07.266 --> 12:09.901
or we tell the world
you got your recruit killed.

12:09.936 --> 12:11.403
Now, why don't
we all play

12:11.437 --> 12:13.371
truth or dare
and move this thing along.

12:13.406 --> 12:15.307
Truth. Sounds
good to me.

12:15.341 --> 12:18.111
Don't waste your time on Ibrahim;
it couldn't be him. I'll prove it.

12:18.112 --> 12:19.478
SWEETS: I don't know,
the serpents, the, uh,

12:19.479 --> 12:20.979
duffel bag, the
public disposals.

12:21.013 --> 12:23.181
Those all appear to be
Ibrahim signatures, right?

12:23.216 --> 12:25.383
I mean, that's exactly
how we found Sari.

12:25.418 --> 12:26.718
He really works with serpents?

12:26.752 --> 12:29.020
Yeah, in every killing
attributed to him.

12:29.055 --> 12:30.522
To Ibrahim,
they're unclean, reviled.

12:30.556 --> 12:32.224
That's one thing
he and I agree on.

12:32.258 --> 12:34.025
They're a way
to degrade his victims.

12:34.060 --> 12:35.727
All right, so you're thinking
that Ibrahim killed Sari?

12:35.761 --> 12:36.962
I'm telling you,

12:36.996 --> 12:39.197
we killed Ibrahim in
that drone strike.

12:39.232 --> 12:42.133
See for yourself.

12:42.168 --> 12:44.236
You sure he was in there?
Yeah.

12:46.138 --> 12:48.039
CAROLINE:
Then that is one

12:48.074 --> 12:49.207
toasted terrorist, <i>cherie.</i>

12:49.242 --> 12:50.809
BOOTH:
Yeah, I don't know.

12:50.843 --> 12:52.611
You know, I've seen guys
like Ibrahim reported dead

12:52.645 --> 12:54.012
four or five
times like this.

12:54.046 --> 12:55.947
Every time you
send out a drone,

12:55.982 --> 12:58.583
you have to report a kill
in order to cover yourselves.

12:58.618 --> 13:00.852
Sari was there. She saw
Ibrahim go into the house.

13:00.887 --> 13:02.554
But didn't you say she was
injured in that blast?

13:02.588 --> 13:04.089
Look, Danny, I know

13:04.123 --> 13:05.924
you don't want to face it,
all right?

13:05.958 --> 13:08.159
Sari and Aziz
put their faith in you.

13:08.194 --> 13:10.095
But you have to know
that it's possible

13:10.129 --> 13:12.230
that Ibrahim is still alive.

13:12.265 --> 13:14.699
Yeah. I mean, it's consistent
with Ibrahim's profile

13:14.734 --> 13:17.969
that he'd want to exact
revenge on Sari, isn't it?

13:18.004 --> 13:20.205
(sighs)

13:20.239 --> 13:22.374
<i>If</i> Ibrahim's alive...

13:22.408 --> 13:25.810
he wouldn't let
anyone else do the job.

13:33.653 --> 13:37.789
These recent contusions
are on the ribs, zygomatic,

13:37.823 --> 13:39.524
maxilla and mandible.

13:39.559 --> 13:42.060
Not cause of death, but it
clearly indicates a struggle.

13:42.094 --> 13:43.328
You found

13:43.362 --> 13:44.563
no fracturing at all?

13:44.597 --> 13:46.064
No evidence of a weapon?
No.

13:46.098 --> 13:48.233
And no evidence of a blow
capable of killing her.

13:48.267 --> 13:49.467
And I was thorough, I swear.

13:49.502 --> 13:50.769
SAROYAN:
The victim was dragged,

13:50.803 --> 13:52.671
violently.

13:52.705 --> 13:56.107
Is this the medial collateral ligament?
Yes.

13:56.142 --> 13:59.311
And it was ruptured, indicating
that the victim was dragged.

13:59.345 --> 14:00.979
Do you concur,
Ms. Wick?

14:04.116 --> 14:07.919
It appears the victim
was indeed dragged,

14:07.954 --> 14:10.689
with enough force to dislocate
the femur from the tibia.

14:10.723 --> 14:12.023
Dr. Saroyan was correct.

14:12.058 --> 14:13.291
Thank you for that.

14:13.326 --> 14:14.693
BRENNAN:
While interesting,

14:14.727 --> 14:16.795
this puts us no closer
to cause of death

14:16.829 --> 14:18.763
or to evidence linking us
to a killer.

14:18.798 --> 14:20.632
When put that way,
it's very bleak.

14:20.666 --> 14:22.634
MONTENEGRO:
Hey, I've got something

14:22.668 --> 14:25.370
I need you to see.

14:26.939 --> 14:28.840
Did Caroline give you
all the information

14:28.874 --> 14:30.108
you needed on Ibrahim?

14:30.142 --> 14:32.777
Yeah, I hope so.

14:32.812 --> 14:34.079
I mean, it's
always possible

14:34.113 --> 14:35.513
the CIA is holding
something back.

14:35.548 --> 14:36.815
I sound
like Hodgins, huh?

14:36.849 --> 14:38.483
In this case, that
would be prudent.

14:38.517 --> 14:41.987
So far, I've run travel
records, bank accounts

14:42.021 --> 14:44.489
airport facial recognition
records, but I couldn't find

14:44.523 --> 14:47.325
anything that
links to Ibrahim

14:47.360 --> 14:48.994
or any of his known aliases.

14:49.028 --> 14:50.996
He could have
used a disguise

14:51.030 --> 14:53.131
or another alias.
Exactly.

14:53.165 --> 14:54.833
And since there
are any number of ways

14:54.867 --> 14:56.034
to sneak into the country,

14:56.068 --> 14:57.836
like merchant ships
and cargo holds...

14:57.870 --> 14:59.571
So we have nothing
but more questions.

14:59.605 --> 15:01.339
The Army had Ibrahim
in custody

15:01.374 --> 15:03.274
for six months in Afghanistan.

15:03.309 --> 15:04.509
I went through service records,

15:04.543 --> 15:06.277
and I found the guy
who guarded him.

15:06.312 --> 15:09.014
BRENNAN:
"Derek Johannessen."

15:09.048 --> 15:11.516
He was the guard on duty
when the prison was bombed.

15:11.550 --> 15:13.918
Ibrahim escaped
with 18 other terrorists.

15:13.953 --> 15:16.421
In his statement,
he said that he was convinced

15:16.455 --> 15:18.123
that Ibrahim would
find a way to America

15:18.157 --> 15:20.358
to avenge his people.

15:23.644 --> 15:25.578
You were in the service,
Mr. Johannessen?

15:26.024 --> 15:28.859
Corporal, yeah. Tried to re-up,
couldn't pass the physical.

15:29.452 --> 15:32.021
Right. And you were
a prison guard in Sangar, right?

15:32.055 --> 15:34.256
One of your prisoners
was Ibrahim Sajadi?

15:34.290 --> 15:35.924
See, that wasn't my fault.

15:35.959 --> 15:38.727
They always want a scapegoat,
but what the hell could I do?

15:38.762 --> 15:41.230
Someone drove up a van
and blew a hole in the wall.

15:41.264 --> 15:43.264
All right, look, no one's
blaming you for anything.

15:43.266 --> 15:45.701
We're just trying to figure out
what you know about Ibrahim,

15:45.735 --> 15:47.136
that's all.

15:48.972 --> 15:51.240
You guys didn't take him out.

15:51.274 --> 15:52.841
He's not dead, is he?

15:52.876 --> 15:54.476
Not definitively.
Oh, man.

15:54.511 --> 15:56.445
You do not want Ibrahim here.

15:56.479 --> 15:58.647
We need you to tell us everything
you can remember about him.

15:58.681 --> 16:01.583
Who he talked to, any contacts
who might still be active.

16:01.618 --> 16:03.819
The guy was in isolation.
I'm the only one he talked to.

16:03.820 --> 16:05.087
About what?

16:05.121 --> 16:06.422
Food, water, towels,

16:06.456 --> 16:08.023
cockroaches.

16:08.058 --> 16:09.491
What do you think,
we were buddies?

16:09.526 --> 16:10.692
BOOTH:
Well, did he mention

16:10.727 --> 16:12.294
any contacts here? Any threats?

16:12.328 --> 16:15.230
I'll think.

16:15.265 --> 16:18.067
I'll do whatever I can, but
that bomb scrambled me a little,

16:18.101 --> 16:19.468
you know what I'm saying?

16:19.502 --> 16:20.669
We've all taken hits.

16:20.703 --> 16:21.970
The memories are
in there somewhere.

16:22.005 --> 16:23.906
Just do what you can.
What I do know,

16:23.940 --> 16:27.142
the other prisoners
called Ibrahim "the chameleon."

16:27.177 --> 16:28.577
He could blend in anywhere.

16:28.611 --> 16:31.680
Which is the last thing you want
in a terrorist.

16:37.420 --> 16:39.688
I ran every tox screen
I can think of,

16:39.722 --> 16:42.257
gone over every inch of
remaining arterial tissue

16:42.292 --> 16:45.260
for incisions, and found nothing
that points to cause of death.

16:45.295 --> 16:47.596
I found some
interesting striations

16:47.630 --> 16:51.200
on the left styloid process,
talus and medial malleolus.

16:51.234 --> 16:54.169
There are two layers
of striations--

16:54.204 --> 16:56.124
one has partially remodeled
and the other hasn't.

16:56.139 --> 16:57.573
Which suggests
the victim struggled

16:57.607 --> 17:00.776
to loosen her ligatures,
but was rebound.

17:00.810 --> 17:03.312
Indicating that
she tried to escape.

17:03.346 --> 17:07.249
Do you feel that I'm a strong,
competent woman

17:07.282 --> 17:08.951
who's more than capable
of defending herself?

17:08.984 --> 17:12.154
This is not about the case,
is it?

17:12.188 --> 17:15.057
It has to do with the inequity
of my life insurance premium.

17:15.090 --> 17:16.325
Right.

17:16.358 --> 17:18.827
Well, a fascinating
political issue.

17:18.862 --> 17:20.963
I don't think I'm
really qualified.

17:20.997 --> 17:22.164
Of course you are.

17:22.198 --> 17:23.898
I was hoping
that after I compiled

17:23.933 --> 17:25.767
the necessary actuarial data

17:25.801 --> 17:28.303
to challenge the company,
you would give

17:28.338 --> 17:31.573
a detailed analysis
of my considerable skills.

17:31.608 --> 17:32.841
Under oath.

17:32.876 --> 17:34.309
Oh! Oath!

17:34.344 --> 17:38.514
Well... I am flattered,
of course.

17:38.548 --> 17:40.749
But may-maybe we should focus

17:40.783 --> 17:43.652
on the case first?

17:43.686 --> 17:45.854
I didn't see any mention
of striations

17:45.889 --> 17:47.990
in Ms. Wick's
preliminary report.

17:48.024 --> 17:49.424
Ms. Wick overlooked them,

17:49.459 --> 17:51.727
as she did much else
in this case.

17:51.761 --> 17:55.697
Remodeling suggests that Sari
was bound for several days

17:55.732 --> 17:57.132
with no additional injuries.

17:57.167 --> 17:59.735
Why would Ibrahim hold her
captive for so long

17:59.769 --> 18:04.239
if his goal was to display
his kill in such a public way?

18:06.176 --> 18:08.844
Don't you think you've gotten
as much information

18:08.878 --> 18:10.913
as you're gonna get
from these guys?

18:10.947 --> 18:13.148
Are you kidding?
Once these guys start to poop...

18:13.183 --> 18:15.250
Okay, okay,
I get the picture,

18:15.285 --> 18:17.119
unfortunately.

18:17.153 --> 18:18.654
You know, I used
to think that

18:18.688 --> 18:21.557
this eel obsession
was weird, but...

18:21.591 --> 18:23.592
now I actually find
it kind of endearing.

18:23.626 --> 18:24.960
You do?

18:24.994 --> 18:26.929
Yeah. I get it.

18:26.963 --> 18:28.630
Yeah, because they're
the sister taxon

18:28.665 --> 18:31.099
of all living jawed vertebrates,
right? So...

18:31.134 --> 18:32.801
No, no, no, sweetie.

18:32.835 --> 18:35.871
I mean, in the last year,
you've lost your fortune

18:35.905 --> 18:38.040
and you found out
you had a brother

18:38.074 --> 18:40.042
who then turned out
to be mentally ill.

18:40.076 --> 18:42.978
You've had all these
major life changes happen,

18:43.012 --> 18:45.814
and you've never once complained

18:45.848 --> 18:48.016
or fallen apart or felt sorry
for yourself.

18:48.051 --> 18:51.787
You just...
you took it in stride.

18:51.821 --> 18:53.322
I don't understand.

18:53.356 --> 18:55.524
I mean, not many people could
deal with what you have.

18:55.558 --> 18:58.894
And then there are these
360-million-year-old creatures

18:58.928 --> 19:01.730
who have stayed the course,
just like you,

19:01.764 --> 19:04.533
no matter what evolution
threw at them.

19:04.567 --> 19:08.403
It just makes sense
that you take a shine to them.

19:08.438 --> 19:10.973
They are pretty special, huh?

19:11.007 --> 19:12.741
Like you.

19:13.843 --> 19:16.812
Hey, look at this.

19:19.015 --> 19:21.116
You're gonna ruin
this moment with poop?

19:21.150 --> 19:23.285
No, it's just that
there's something in it.

19:23.319 --> 19:25.153
Looks like fiber.

19:28.825 --> 19:30.993
Piece of twine?

19:31.027 --> 19:32.995
Jute-- it is twine.

19:33.029 --> 19:34.830
Yeah, what she
was bound with.

19:34.864 --> 19:37.833
Well, there seems to be traces
of blood and tissue in the weave

19:37.867 --> 19:39.401
I can give to Cam

19:39.435 --> 19:42.104
and what looks like
pollen from Ipomoea purpurea.

19:42.138 --> 19:44.706
That's a morning glory.

19:44.741 --> 19:47.276
Sari Nazeri's brother
is a landscaper.

19:49.112 --> 19:50.912
Thanks for making
time for me, Lance.

19:50.947 --> 19:52.214
Of course.

19:52.248 --> 19:54.182
I'm always happy
to make time for you.

19:54.217 --> 19:56.785
But, uh, you know,
if this is about

19:56.819 --> 19:58.487
us getting back
together...

19:58.521 --> 20:00.722
What?! No.

20:00.757 --> 20:03.091
I just missed you, as a friend.

20:03.126 --> 20:05.260
Although I do miss
the sex sometimes.

20:05.295 --> 20:06.662
Just for the record.

20:06.696 --> 20:08.196
What is it?

20:08.231 --> 20:10.299
I mean, you're clearly upset
about something.

20:11.668 --> 20:14.436
I took my orals
for my doctorate.

20:14.470 --> 20:16.238
I thought you said
that those were postponed.

20:16.272 --> 20:17.239
I lied.

20:17.273 --> 20:20.175
I went and I failed.

20:20.209 --> 20:22.177
Ah.
I'm a failure.

20:22.211 --> 20:23.912
And a liar.

20:23.946 --> 20:25.847
Which, interestingly,
doesn't concern me as much

20:25.882 --> 20:27.149
as the failure part right now.

20:27.183 --> 20:28.884
Right. You know what?
It's all right.

20:28.918 --> 20:30.619
Everybody stumbles.

20:30.653 --> 20:33.922
You just have to accept it,
move forward, try again, right?

20:33.956 --> 20:36.325
But my work has
been terrible.

20:36.359 --> 20:38.860
I've been overlooking
really obvious things.

20:38.895 --> 20:42.130
And Dr. Brennan is gonna
fire me, I know it.

20:42.165 --> 20:43.965
Just tell Dr. Brennan
what happened.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.934
I'm sure she'll understand
what you're going through.

20:45.968 --> 20:48.003
Are we talking about the
same Dr. Brennan, Lance?

20:48.037 --> 20:50.505
The one who
demands perfection?

20:50.540 --> 20:53.542
You want me to tell that
Dr. Brennan that I'm a failure?

20:53.576 --> 20:55.844
Trust me. She'll understand.

20:58.214 --> 21:00.582
I really have missed you, Lance.

21:00.616 --> 21:03.085
And the sex.

21:03.119 --> 21:06.555
Just talk to Dr. Brennan,
all right?

21:06.589 --> 21:08.023
Not... not about the sex.

21:08.057 --> 21:09.524
No?

21:09.559 --> 21:11.660
God, no.

21:11.694 --> 21:13.061
So, the squints
found a piece of twine

21:13.096 --> 21:14.930
we might be able to link
to Sari's brother.

21:14.964 --> 21:16.365
Her brother?
Yeah.

21:16.399 --> 21:18.133
Nah, they were
close, Seeley.

21:18.167 --> 21:19.868
I can't see him
killing her.

21:19.902 --> 21:21.236
So, you never
saw them fight?

21:21.270 --> 21:23.238
Okay, you never
saw him do that whole

21:23.272 --> 21:25.006
women-are-less-than-men thing?

21:25.041 --> 21:27.161
You're talking about a
cultural bias that doesn't fit.

21:27.176 --> 21:28.877
They emigrated to
the U.S. voluntarily.

21:28.911 --> 21:30.245
They begged to come.

21:30.279 --> 21:31.546
So they were perfect.

21:31.581 --> 21:33.281
(sighs)

21:35.151 --> 21:37.586
Look, we got off

21:37.620 --> 21:39.388
on the wrong foot, I get that.

21:39.422 --> 21:41.423
But we've known each other
for a long time.

21:41.457 --> 21:43.458
Look, you can't protect
your assets and your agency,

21:43.493 --> 21:44.960
while we're laying all the facts

21:44.994 --> 21:46.428
on the table.

21:46.462 --> 21:48.163
Okay, sure,
they fought sometimes,

21:48.197 --> 21:49.898
but like brothers
and sisters do.

21:49.932 --> 21:51.566
It's hard adjusting
to a new life.

21:51.601 --> 21:53.301
You've seen that
in witness protection cases.

21:53.336 --> 21:55.370
It's worse moving
to another country.

21:55.405 --> 21:57.272
But he loved her, Seeley.

21:57.306 --> 21:58.874
(elevator bell dings)

21:58.908 --> 22:01.109
Bones, what are you doing here?

22:01.144 --> 22:03.445
I checked the ligature marks
on Sari's bones,

22:03.479 --> 22:05.781
and the jute gardening twine
is a match.

22:05.815 --> 22:08.950
Also, Cam confirmed that it was
Sari's tissue in the weave.

22:08.985 --> 22:10.719
Yeah, she called.

22:10.753 --> 22:13.889
Also, Angela checked
Aziz Nazeri's

22:13.923 --> 22:15.590
credit card receipts;
he bought a disposable

22:15.625 --> 22:18.627
cell phone from Appomattox
Appliances three weeks ago.

22:18.661 --> 22:20.639
He already had a cell phone.
I have the number.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.564
Aziz made minimum wage.
If he was buying another phone,

22:22.565 --> 22:24.065
that means
he was hiding something.

22:24.100 --> 22:25.801
Are you sure that you guys
know nothing about this?

22:25.835 --> 22:28.170
Are we doing this again?

22:28.204 --> 22:30.071
No. Sari was my asset, not Aziz.

22:30.106 --> 22:32.274
BRENNAN:
Angela got the make

22:32.308 --> 22:33.942
and serial number of the phone

22:33.976 --> 22:36.745
so she could trace the calls
using Aziz's location.

22:36.779 --> 22:38.447
He called a number
in Helsinki

22:38.481 --> 22:41.049
that reroutes transmissions
to Afghanistan

22:41.083 --> 22:43.752
to the town of Ghazni.
BECK: Man.

22:43.786 --> 22:46.555
He didn't want his calls traced.
When was the last call made?

22:46.589 --> 22:49.391
Two days before Sari was killed,
and then nothing.

22:49.425 --> 22:51.760
It's Jamaal Ahmad.
What?

22:51.794 --> 22:53.595
BECK: He's one of
Ibrahim's guys.

22:53.629 --> 22:55.197
The agency's been tracking him.
He's in Ghazni.

22:55.231 --> 22:56.765
And you were gonna
tell me this when?

22:56.799 --> 22:57.999
I didn't think it was relevant.

22:58.034 --> 22:59.167
I told you now, didn't I?

22:59.202 --> 23:01.203
Fine. Let's go get Aziz.

23:01.237 --> 23:03.271
I'm coming with you.
Uh, I don't think that's a good idea.

23:03.306 --> 23:05.373
I'm Booth's partner,
and I wasn't talking to you.

23:05.408 --> 23:06.575
I think maybe you
should stay back.

23:06.609 --> 23:08.143
It could be a
little dangerous.

23:08.177 --> 23:09.578
Three well-trained people
questioning one man?

23:09.612 --> 23:11.813
Am I the only one
who isn't afraid?

23:11.848 --> 23:13.915
Sounds like you work
for the insurance company.

23:13.950 --> 23:15.484
Are you coming?
Yeah.

23:15.518 --> 23:17.319
Right.

23:17.353 --> 23:20.755
How can you possibly think I had
any connection to Ibrahim?!

23:20.790 --> 23:22.324
He murdered my sister!

23:22.358 --> 23:24.059
We know you bought a
phone to call Ghazni.

23:24.093 --> 23:25.594
Who were calling,
huh? Jamaal Ahmad?

23:25.628 --> 23:26.895
You were on Ibrahim's
death list, Aziz.

23:26.929 --> 23:28.296
Why are you calling

23:28.331 --> 23:30.732
his number two guy?

23:32.902 --> 23:34.503
Whoa, whoa!

23:39.809 --> 23:41.443
Oh, Bones!

23:41.477 --> 23:44.045
Nice hit! Good hit there, Bones.
Geez!

23:44.080 --> 23:46.147
All right, let's go.
Talk. Come on!

23:46.182 --> 23:48.149
I wanted to go home.

23:48.184 --> 23:49.451
And Jamaal Ahmad was

23:49.485 --> 23:51.152
the only one who could
make that happen.

23:51.187 --> 23:52.754
He could talk to Ibrahim
and make peace for me.

23:52.788 --> 23:54.189
BECK:
I got you and Sari

23:54.223 --> 23:56.525
out of there; you said
you wanted to go.

23:56.559 --> 23:58.479
No. I said I <i>had</i> to go,
because of what Sari did.

23:58.494 --> 23:59.494
I never wanted to go.

23:59.529 --> 24:01.096
In Afghanistan,
I was respected.

24:01.130 --> 24:02.497
Here, I cut the lawn
for rich people.

24:02.532 --> 24:03.999
BOOTH: No, they would
never let you

24:04.033 --> 24:06.234
back in, you got to know that.
BRENNAN: They might.

24:06.269 --> 24:10.205
Sari became a traitor when she
started working with the CIA.

24:10.239 --> 24:13.441
If he killed her, Aziz would
prove his loyalty to Ibrahim.

24:13.476 --> 24:15.310
No. I wanted
to take her home.

24:15.344 --> 24:17.279
That's where our life was.
Sari couldn't go back.

24:17.313 --> 24:19.648
You always told us
everything was possible.

24:19.682 --> 24:21.983
But she didn't want to go back.
She was clear on that.

24:22.018 --> 24:24.319
You always thought
you knew her so well, huh?

24:24.353 --> 24:26.288
Well, did you know,
in the past month,

24:26.322 --> 24:28.156
she would leave
the house at night?

24:28.190 --> 24:29.658
Sometimes be gone
until morning?

24:29.692 --> 24:31.059
This is America, Aziz.

24:31.093 --> 24:33.728
Women are free to live
the life they want.

24:33.763 --> 24:36.298
You had no idea she was
disappearing at night?

24:36.332 --> 24:38.199
She's really not helping,
Seeley.

24:38.234 --> 24:39.568
No, she kind of is,
all right?

24:39.602 --> 24:41.369
A source, what,
changes her behavior?

24:41.404 --> 24:44.139
And what do you do?
You just, what, brush it off?

24:44.173 --> 24:46.474
Is that how you were trained?
AZIZ: Yeah, I told you she was

24:46.509 --> 24:47.842
acting strange,
but you did nothing.

24:47.877 --> 24:49.411
You had no idea
where she was going

24:49.445 --> 24:51.880
on those nights she disappeared?
No idea.

24:51.914 --> 24:54.416
Are you sure about that?
Who are we questioning here?

24:54.450 --> 24:56.585
I don't know.

25:03.557 --> 25:05.277
Danny knows something
about Sari's murder,

25:05.278 --> 25:07.372
and he's not telling us.
Maybe he can't.

25:07.373 --> 25:09.041
It could be classified, right?
Wouldn't matter.

25:09.075 --> 25:10.916
Booth's security clearance
is pretty damn high.

25:10.944 --> 25:13.178
You know, I'm sick and tired of
this guy keeping stuff from me.

25:13.213 --> 25:14.913
I'm bringing him in
for impeding an investigation.

25:14.948 --> 25:16.315
Hey, hey,
reign it in, cowboy.

25:16.349 --> 25:18.283
You do not want
to start a turf war

25:18.318 --> 25:20.752
between the CIA and
FBI, mostly because

25:20.787 --> 25:22.287
I'd be caught
in the middle of it.

25:22.322 --> 25:24.056
SWEETS: His defensiveness
could be explained by

25:24.090 --> 25:25.958
the guilt he feels for failing
to protect his source.

25:25.992 --> 25:27.392
Are you really thinking
he killed her?

25:27.427 --> 25:29.027
It could explain a lot.

25:29.062 --> 25:31.430
Why would he want to kill the
woman whose life he saved?

25:31.464 --> 25:32.898
You know what?
Things happen in a war.

25:32.932 --> 25:34.500
Okay, you end up doing stuff

25:34.534 --> 25:35.801
that could destroy you
if it came out.

25:35.835 --> 25:37.636
Do you think
she was blackmailing him?

25:37.670 --> 25:39.538
To get a better deal or to get
a better job for her brother.

25:39.572 --> 25:41.139
I've seen it before.
CAROLINE: You may be right,

25:41.174 --> 25:44.109
<i>cher,</i> but for the sake
of your career and mine,

25:44.143 --> 25:46.745
you can't arrest Danny
on a hunch.

25:48.615 --> 25:50.315
The CIA guy?
Aren't they trained to kill

25:50.350 --> 25:51.984
so that no one
will ever find out?

25:52.018 --> 25:54.253
Those killings
aren't solved

25:54.287 --> 25:56.655
because those investigations
don't wind up with us.

25:56.689 --> 25:58.457
"Us"?

25:58.491 --> 25:59.958
We're "us"?

25:59.993 --> 26:01.260
I'm still making up my mind.

26:01.294 --> 26:02.895
We're looking
for something

26:02.929 --> 26:05.564
that is meant to
be overlooked.

26:05.598 --> 26:08.700
Dr. Brennan, I know you've had
issues with my performance.

26:08.735 --> 26:10.836
And I'd like to clear things up.

26:10.870 --> 26:13.839
The best way to clear it up is
to impress me with your work.

26:15.842 --> 26:17.876
I failed my orals.

26:17.911 --> 26:19.211
Oh.

26:19.245 --> 26:21.680
And that has affected
your work here?

26:21.714 --> 26:23.615
I knew everything,

26:23.650 --> 26:26.852
and then the second that they
started asking me questions,

26:26.886 --> 26:29.988
I felt dizzy, and everything
I knew just vanished.

26:30.023 --> 26:31.189
I almost fainted.

26:31.224 --> 26:33.091
You experienced
a vasovagal reaction

26:33.126 --> 26:35.294
brought on by extreme stress.

26:35.328 --> 26:37.162
It's not an
uncommon response.

26:37.196 --> 26:38.897
But it's humiliating.
Oh.

26:38.932 --> 26:40.732
(chuckles):
It's definitely humiliating.

26:40.767 --> 26:43.735
Lance said you'd be
more understanding.

26:43.770 --> 26:45.304
I understood

26:45.338 --> 26:47.406
that you humiliated yourself.

26:47.440 --> 26:49.074
And I understand
that it's meaningless.

26:49.108 --> 26:50.375
When I failed my orals,

26:50.410 --> 26:52.711
I continued to excel
at my internship.

26:52.745 --> 26:55.080
You failed your orals, too?

26:55.114 --> 26:57.416
I felt the board was not
competent enough to judge me--

26:57.450 --> 26:59.017
a fact that I communicated
to them.

26:59.052 --> 27:00.552
They didn't appreciate
my honesty.

27:00.587 --> 27:02.187
No matter.

27:02.221 --> 27:04.256
Orals are an antiquated
useless tradition

27:04.290 --> 27:07.125
meant to make
professors feel superior.

27:08.861 --> 27:10.495
If I were an insurance company,

27:10.530 --> 27:12.831
I would give you
a policy for free.

27:12.865 --> 27:14.099
I've run the actuarials.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.535
That would be
fiscally irresponsible.

27:16.569 --> 27:19.905
Dr. Brennan, I feel something.

27:19.939 --> 27:22.574
There's a contusion on
the anterior third sternal rib.

27:22.609 --> 27:24.076
I observed it earlier.

27:24.110 --> 27:25.978
But there's something
inside the contusion.

27:30.583 --> 27:32.718
You're right.

27:35.955 --> 27:39.257
It's a microscopic
V-shaped nick.

27:39.292 --> 27:40.459
Very good, Ms. Wick.

27:40.493 --> 27:41.760
Well, you always say
to feel the bones.

27:41.794 --> 27:43.662
Something those twits

27:43.696 --> 27:45.697
who give the orals
wouldn't know, right?

27:45.732 --> 27:46.932
Unless you get me.

27:46.966 --> 27:48.400
Right.

27:48.434 --> 27:51.269
I'll give that
to Dr. Hodgins to swab.

27:51.304 --> 27:52.938
Then to Angela;
she can scan the nick

27:52.972 --> 27:55.173
to see if she can recreate
a potential weapon.

27:57.110 --> 27:59.177
Ms. Wick?

28:00.446 --> 28:01.880
Good work.

28:03.583 --> 28:05.717
(computer beeping)

28:07.587 --> 28:09.021
Hey, Angie. How's it going?

28:09.055 --> 28:11.256
Well, I matched the nick
on the bone with the angle

28:11.290 --> 28:12.924
of the blade
that caused the incision.

28:12.959 --> 28:14.393
And there's potentially
five other knives

28:14.427 --> 28:15.594
that the killer
could've used.

28:15.628 --> 28:16.908
All right, well,
this might help.

28:16.929 --> 28:18.363
So, the swab from the nick

28:18.398 --> 28:21.066
showed particulates
of high-carbon 440B steel

28:21.100 --> 28:22.834
and traces of Kydex.

28:22.869 --> 28:24.336
It's probably from the sheath.

28:24.370 --> 28:25.804
Hey, that's a specialty steel,

28:25.838 --> 28:27.639
used only for very high-end
tactical knives.

28:27.674 --> 28:31.009
Okay, the knife was made
by Higginson in El Paso.

28:31.044 --> 28:32.944
Looks like it was
a custom run.

28:32.979 --> 28:34.613
They only made
800 of them.

28:34.647 --> 28:37.315
For Special Forces.

28:39.000 --> 28:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here

28:48.594 --> 28:51.096
BOOTH:
Danny?

28:51.130 --> 28:52.431
Give me your gun.

28:52.465 --> 28:53.899
What the hell's this about?

28:57.470 --> 28:58.904
Give me your gun.

29:03.710 --> 29:04.943
Knife?

29:04.977 --> 29:05.977
What knife?

29:06.012 --> 29:07.212
The Higginson, the one you and I

29:07.246 --> 29:08.313
were both given
back at Special Forces.

29:08.347 --> 29:09.414
I don't know. I lost it

29:09.449 --> 29:10.982
in a move.
You lost it in a move?

29:11.017 --> 29:13.985
Really? We know it was the knife
that stabbed Sari.

29:14.020 --> 29:16.321
What?

29:17.957 --> 29:19.491
Hey, you are way
over the line here, Booth.

29:19.525 --> 29:20.892
You think I killed Sari?

29:20.927 --> 29:22.594
Right now,
you're my best suspect, pal.

29:22.628 --> 29:24.463
I gave Sari the knife
to protect herself.

29:24.497 --> 29:25.797
You gave her a knife?

29:25.832 --> 29:27.032
She didn't like guns.

29:27.066 --> 29:28.300
Look, she must've tried to use

29:28.334 --> 29:29.835
the knife on Ibrahim
when he took her,

29:29.869 --> 29:31.636
and he turned it
on Sari instead.

29:31.671 --> 29:33.138
That knife was
a part of you.

29:33.172 --> 29:35.240
You told me it was
what kept you alive in Mosul.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.442
Now, you would
never give that up.

29:39.746 --> 29:42.080
(sighs)

29:42.115 --> 29:45.016
I gave her the knife
because it was a part of me.

29:45.051 --> 29:47.119
She was...

29:50.189 --> 29:52.491
Doesn't matter.

29:52.525 --> 29:54.793
You were sleeping
with the source.

29:54.827 --> 29:56.361
Hey, I loved
her, Seeley.

29:56.395 --> 29:58.663
Look, I know it was wrong. I...

29:58.698 --> 29:59.898
It just happened.

29:59.932 --> 30:01.166
What happened
to working together, huh?

30:01.200 --> 30:02.400
Telling me everything?

30:02.435 --> 30:03.368
Look, you're right.

30:03.402 --> 30:04.770
I should've.

30:04.804 --> 30:06.705
But if the Agency finds out,
I'm done!

30:06.739 --> 30:07.806
You know that.

30:07.840 --> 30:09.274
Look, I just
figured we'd find

30:09.308 --> 30:10.876
who killed her, and
whatever happened

30:10.910 --> 30:14.713
between Sari and me
would stay between Sari and me.

30:14.747 --> 30:16.448
Why should I believe you now?

30:16.482 --> 30:18.183
Because I just came
from a briefing.

30:18.217 --> 30:20.852
We're getting intel
that Ibrahim really is here.

30:20.887 --> 30:24.322
And Sari was
just a warning shot.

30:28.866 --> 30:31.216
It might be Danny Beck's knife
and you might be able

30:31.217 --> 30:32.684
to get an attempted
murder charge,

30:32.718 --> 30:35.520
but the wound
was superficial.

30:35.555 --> 30:37.116
The knife didn't
penetrate deeply enough

30:37.123 --> 30:38.757
to sever any arteries.

30:38.791 --> 30:42.194
So, you still don't know
how that poor girl was killed?

30:42.228 --> 30:45.197
Nope.

30:45.231 --> 30:47.098
I do have an idea though.

30:48.201 --> 30:50.869
You know, we have
a nice lounge

30:50.903 --> 30:53.138
upstairs that might be
more comfortable for you.

30:53.172 --> 30:54.172
Yeah, but

30:54.207 --> 30:55.640
then I'd be depriving you

30:55.675 --> 30:56.942
of my talent to backseat drive.

30:56.976 --> 30:58.710
And we wouldn't want that.

30:58.744 --> 31:01.880
So all we know
for sure is

31:01.914 --> 31:03.782
she was stabbed
a little and tied up.

31:03.816 --> 31:05.383
That's about right.

31:05.418 --> 31:06.651
But what I don't understand

31:06.686 --> 31:09.287
is why leave her
tied up for so long?

31:09.322 --> 31:10.589
I just nudge, <i>cherie.</i>

31:10.623 --> 31:12.657
You're the one
who gets the answers.

31:12.692 --> 31:14.860
Oh! That's an eyeball! Please!

31:14.894 --> 31:17.729
I repeat:
coffee and donuts in the lounge.

31:17.763 --> 31:19.164
As if I could eat now.

31:19.198 --> 31:20.866
I'm using
vitreous fluid

31:20.900 --> 31:22.467
to run a test for potassium

31:22.501 --> 31:24.870
that could give us
environmental data,

31:24.904 --> 31:27.572
like the location
where she was kept,

31:27.607 --> 31:29.975
the type of enclosure.

31:30.977 --> 31:32.944
(device beeps)

31:32.979 --> 31:34.512
Oh, my God.

31:34.547 --> 31:35.647
Now, that sounds good.

31:35.681 --> 31:37.449
I have cause
of death.

31:37.483 --> 31:39.050
She was left to die.

31:39.085 --> 31:40.785
That was her torture.

31:40.820 --> 31:42.954
She died of dehydration.

31:45.458 --> 31:47.325
So you're saying
that Danny tied her up

31:47.360 --> 31:49.160
and left her to die
of dehydration?

31:49.195 --> 31:51.830
Wow, that's even
cold for the CIA.

31:51.864 --> 31:53.932
I'm not saying that,
<i>cher,</i> you are.

31:53.966 --> 31:56.167
If James Bond wanted
to get rid of her,

31:56.202 --> 31:57.869
he had
a million choices,

31:57.904 --> 32:00.538
none of which carried the risk
of someone stumbling upon her

32:00.573 --> 32:02.407
as she was dying slowly.

32:02.441 --> 32:04.943
Even if he wasn't in love with
her, she was a source, right?

32:04.977 --> 32:06.111
So we would have
found something

32:06.145 --> 32:07.913
to indicate a
personal attachment,

32:07.947 --> 32:10.148
but this murder is
cold and impersonal.

32:10.182 --> 32:12.183
So Danny was right--
it was Ibrahim.

32:12.218 --> 32:13.752
With Ibrahim, it's always
about direct payback--

32:13.786 --> 32:15.954
literally an eye
for an eye--

32:15.988 --> 32:18.123
so even if he didn't die
from that drone strike,

32:18.157 --> 32:19.758
his bodyguards did,
his lieutenant,

32:19.792 --> 32:21.526
and most important,
his family.

32:21.560 --> 32:23.161
So he would have killed Sari
with a bomb.

32:23.162 --> 32:24.663
BOOTH: No, no, no,
not necessarily.

32:24.697 --> 32:27.299
I mean, those houses
are made out of stone.

32:27.333 --> 32:29.534
A lot of times,
when a bomb hits,

32:29.568 --> 32:31.736
you don't die
from the explosion.

32:31.771 --> 32:34.339
I mean, you-you die slowly from
being trapped in the rubble.

32:34.373 --> 32:35.607
No way to get out,

32:35.641 --> 32:37.175
no water.

32:37.209 --> 32:38.310
You'd dehydrate.

32:38.344 --> 32:39.711
SWEETS:
It would take days.

32:39.745 --> 32:41.980
An eye for an eye.
So it was Ibrahim.

32:42.014 --> 32:44.783
Danny said he has
something else planned.

32:45.985 --> 32:47.686
Did you find something,
Ms. Wick?

32:47.720 --> 32:49.054
Yes, I did.

32:49.088 --> 32:50.588
As you'll recall,
the lampreys left

32:50.623 --> 32:52.757
significant abrasion
marks on the clavicles,

32:52.792 --> 32:55.460
the scapula, the mandible
and the maxilla.

32:55.494 --> 32:57.495
Lampreys can often leave marks
that can be misinterpreted

32:57.530 --> 32:59.030
for either...

32:59.065 --> 33:00.565
You're not doing
your orals, Ms. Wick;

33:00.599 --> 33:01.800
just show me what you found.

33:01.834 --> 33:02.867
Can do.

33:02.902 --> 33:04.669
Finally, look
at the mandible.

33:04.704 --> 33:06.538
See this abrasion mark
on the right condyloid process?

33:06.572 --> 33:08.073
You're saying that
it wasn't caused

33:08.107 --> 33:10.642
by the lampreys when they ate
the mandibular muscle.

33:10.676 --> 33:14.179
That's right. It's an
avulsion fracture.

33:14.213 --> 33:15.880
It indicates that
Sari bit her attacker

33:15.915 --> 33:17.749
with exceptional force.

33:17.783 --> 33:20.185
She didn't give up, she
was fighting to live.

33:20.219 --> 33:22.153
Please examine the teeth

33:22.188 --> 33:23.455
and any pockets
in the mandible

33:23.489 --> 33:25.423
where tissue could
still be present.

33:25.458 --> 33:27.892
So that Dr. Saroyan can potentially
find the assailant's DNA?

33:27.927 --> 33:29.127
I've already
done that.

33:29.161 --> 33:30.829
Because in every
investigation,

33:30.863 --> 33:34.099
the proper methods of evidence
collection demand that...

33:35.101 --> 33:37.702
Not my orals. Sorry.

33:40.873 --> 33:43.808
I am so gonna kick ass
next time I take them.

33:43.843 --> 33:45.510
(sighs)

33:46.879 --> 33:48.680
BOOTH:
<i>What do you have, Bones?</i>

33:48.714 --> 33:50.849
There's no remaining
tissue in the teeth.

33:50.883 --> 33:52.117
But I found

33:52.151 --> 33:53.952
aspirated skin fragments
at the bifurcation

33:53.986 --> 33:55.920
of the victim's
primary bronchi.

33:55.955 --> 33:58.456
What is that?
That Sari bit her killer

33:58.491 --> 34:01.059
and inhaled some
particles of his skin.

34:01.093 --> 34:02.761
SAROYAN: We're running it
through the database,

34:02.795 --> 34:04.529
but preliminary
analysis indicates

34:04.563 --> 34:06.398
we're looking for
a Nordic male.

34:06.432 --> 34:09.400
Nordic? Okay, I'm...
I'm no squint,

34:09.435 --> 34:11.503
but even I know
that, uh, Ibrahim

34:11.536 --> 34:13.705
is not Nordic.
And neither is Danny.

34:13.739 --> 34:14.938
Have you
questioned anybody

34:14.974 --> 34:16.373
who is of
Scandinavian extraction?

34:17.309 --> 34:18.676
Johannessen.

34:18.710 --> 34:21.045
According to the military CODEC,

34:21.080 --> 34:23.081
the DNA is a match
to Derek Johannessen.

34:23.114 --> 34:24.315
That's no surprise.

34:24.350 --> 34:26.451
Look at this.

34:27.786 --> 34:30.188
Danny sent over
all the known financial fronts

34:30.222 --> 34:32.489
for terrorist organizations
working out of Ghazni.

34:32.525 --> 34:35.025
SAROYAN: All of this money
is Johannessen's?

34:35.061 --> 34:36.226
MONTENEGRO:
Yeah, he used aliases

34:36.262 --> 34:38.163
and offshore
bank accounts,

34:38.197 --> 34:39.864
shell companies,
but yeah,

34:39.899 --> 34:42.199
all of the money
came to him.

34:42.234 --> 34:43.635
And it came from
Ibrahim's network.

34:43.668 --> 34:44.936
BOOTH:
<i>So they paid</i>

34:44.969 --> 34:46.471
Johannessen
to kill Sari

34:46.505 --> 34:49.274
to make the world think
that Ibrahim was still alive?

34:49.308 --> 34:50.909
Yeah.
And the chatter

34:50.943 --> 34:53.277
the CIA picked up about
the impending U.S. attack

34:53.312 --> 34:55.612
was also traced
back to Johannessen.

34:55.648 --> 34:57.615
So Ibrahim must have died
in that drone strike.

34:57.650 --> 34:58.850
Had to.

34:58.884 --> 35:00.752
Hey, uh, listen, Booth.
Yeah?

35:00.786 --> 35:02.754
I want you to know,

35:02.788 --> 35:05.156
I should've come clean,
about everything.

35:05.191 --> 35:07.492
And what you did...

35:07.526 --> 35:09.661
I'd have thrown me
in jail just like you.

35:09.695 --> 35:11.763
(sighs)

35:11.797 --> 35:13.731
Look, did you love her?

35:13.766 --> 35:15.800
Yeah.

35:15.835 --> 35:18.002
I could never
lie about that.

35:20.806 --> 35:22.941
I'm sorry you lost her.

35:27.279 --> 35:29.114
So Johannessen must've
been recruited by Ibrahim

35:29.148 --> 35:30.582
when he was a guard.

35:30.616 --> 35:32.917
That son of a bitch
has no morals at all.

35:32.952 --> 35:34.486
You and your team
did an amazing job.

35:34.520 --> 35:35.920
Better than my guys.

35:35.955 --> 35:36.955
Of course.

35:36.989 --> 35:38.490
My job is clearly done,

35:38.524 --> 35:40.291
so why am I still here?
BOOTH: Why?

35:40.326 --> 35:41.993
Because you're my partner
and we close cases together,

35:42.027 --> 35:43.761
and that's never gonna change,
that's why.

35:43.796 --> 35:45.163
And I don't
care what any

35:45.197 --> 35:47.232
insurance company
has to say.

35:47.266 --> 35:50.235
Now, don't shoot
the messenger, <i>cher.</i>

35:50.269 --> 35:51.436
No.

35:51.470 --> 35:52.937
Yeah.
What?

35:52.972 --> 35:54.239
The powers that be

35:54.273 --> 35:55.807
have decided that if Johannessen

35:55.841 --> 35:57.342
gives us
Ibrahim's network,

35:57.376 --> 35:59.544
he gets his freedom and
ten million dollars

35:59.578 --> 36:01.613
in taxpayer money
to enjoy it with.

36:01.647 --> 36:03.381
No, but he's a murderer!
I... we gave you

36:03.415 --> 36:05.517
all of the evidence that you need.
He can provide

36:05.551 --> 36:07.285
the government with the
entire network over there--

36:07.319 --> 36:10.121
how they finance themselves,
who the operatives are.

36:10.156 --> 36:11.523
And that's a lot more
important to them

36:11.557 --> 36:13.024
than one dead
Afghani woman.

36:13.058 --> 36:14.726
Hey, look,
I can get it out of him.

36:14.760 --> 36:15.994
Sorry, Booth.

36:16.028 --> 36:18.029
I have the order from the DOJ.

36:18.063 --> 36:22.133
Now let me go get this
unfortunate business over with.

36:24.069 --> 36:26.037
This is not gonna stand.

36:26.071 --> 36:27.505
Let it go, Booth.

36:27.540 --> 36:29.007
No, Bones,
I'm not gonna

36:29.041 --> 36:30.074
let it go, okay?

36:30.109 --> 36:32.010
This guy-- he's got to pay.

36:33.712 --> 36:36.347
He's gonna pay.

36:50.763 --> 36:53.565
SARI: I may not know
the names or faces

36:53.599 --> 36:55.667
of all those who are with me,

36:55.701 --> 36:57.936
but I am not alone
in this struggle.

36:57.970 --> 36:59.571
He killed this
beautiful woman.

36:59.605 --> 37:02.807
I can't believe
Johannessen's gonna go free.

37:02.841 --> 37:06.511
So, you see, it doesn't matter
what happens to me.

37:06.545 --> 37:09.847
As long as the fight lives on,
I live on.

37:09.882 --> 37:12.150
Seven million views
in two days?

37:12.184 --> 37:14.085
She can't have
died for nothing.

37:14.119 --> 37:16.154
And why do I think

37:16.188 --> 37:17.855
you had something
to do with that?

37:17.890 --> 37:21.426
Every small girl
who learns to read,

37:21.460 --> 37:24.162
every woman who has
the courage to become

37:24.196 --> 37:26.564
a teacher or a doctor...

37:26.599 --> 37:29.334
they keep the dream alive.

37:29.368 --> 37:32.036
They keep the darkness away.

37:32.071 --> 37:36.374
I don't understand why
people fear an educated woman.

37:38.410 --> 37:40.878
Well, maybe I do.

37:40.913 --> 37:43.281
Because it is clear that

37:43.315 --> 37:46.484
ignorance is no match
for a curious mind.

37:46.518 --> 37:48.386
<i>And hatred and oppression</i>

37:48.420 --> 37:51.089
<i>are no match</i>
<i>for the human heart.</i>

37:55.461 --> 37:57.762
<i>Compassion and love</i>
<i>will guide us,</i>

37:57.796 --> 38:01.799
<i>and freedom will be our reward.</i>

38:04.103 --> 38:08.072
♪ When you're away... ♪

38:08.107 --> 38:10.275
BOOTH: So, the guys
over at the CIA,

38:10.309 --> 38:11.909
they're just throwing a party.

38:11.944 --> 38:14.912
All the information you gave
about Ibrahim's people...

38:14.947 --> 38:16.614
all checked out.
Yeah, well,

38:16.649 --> 38:18.249
of course it did.

38:18.284 --> 38:20.218
Listen, I hope there's
no hard feelings,

38:20.252 --> 38:24.022
Agent Booth, but...
business is business.

38:24.056 --> 38:25.223
And Sari? What?

38:25.257 --> 38:26.991
She was just
collateral damage?

38:27.026 --> 38:29.193
You've been to war; it happens.

38:29.228 --> 38:31.062
Yeah, I chose a side.
I believed in something.

38:31.096 --> 38:32.463
Good for you.

38:32.498 --> 38:33.731
Listen, I got to go...

38:33.766 --> 38:34.799
All right,
just one more thing.

38:34.833 --> 38:36.134
Got a gift for you.

38:36.168 --> 38:38.403
It's a small token

38:38.437 --> 38:40.571
of appreciation
from the government.

38:43.909 --> 38:45.710
JOHANNESSEN:
What's this?

38:45.744 --> 38:47.612
BOOTH: Did a little digging
in your records and found out

38:47.646 --> 38:50.381
that the military is still
paying for your rehab.

38:50.416 --> 38:51.916
Yeah, well, they should.

38:51.950 --> 38:53.384
I took a blast for them.

38:53.419 --> 38:54.452
BECK:
It also means,

38:54.486 --> 38:55.787
according to Article Two

38:55.821 --> 38:57.755
of the Uniform Code
of Military Justice,

38:57.790 --> 39:00.958
you're still subject
to a court-martial.

39:00.993 --> 39:02.927
And since military court is
independent from the DOJ...

39:02.961 --> 39:05.596
BECK: Especially when
it comes to soldiers

39:05.631 --> 39:06.998
making deals with terrorists,

39:07.032 --> 39:10.768
You can finish your rehab
behind bars.

39:10.803 --> 39:12.503
This isn't gonna work, guys.

39:12.538 --> 39:13.938
No, I'm pretty sure it is.

39:13.972 --> 39:16.074
Because you violated
Code section 104 to 118,

39:16.108 --> 39:19.277
which means you'll be charged
with treason and murder.

39:19.311 --> 39:21.271
Those carry the death penalty,
don't they, Seeley?

39:27.619 --> 39:30.855
Business is business, right?

39:40.332 --> 39:41.532
Thanks.

39:41.567 --> 39:43.201
Right.

39:43.235 --> 39:45.903
Just remember next time
who your friends are, okay?

39:59.852 --> 40:01.519
Oh. Ready to go?

40:01.553 --> 40:02.954
Oh. Yes.

40:02.988 --> 40:05.022
Sure.

40:05.057 --> 40:06.691
What is this?

40:06.725 --> 40:07.992
It's a little
something for you.

40:08.026 --> 40:09.460
Go ahead, open it up.

40:13.165 --> 40:14.432
(chuckles)
Scotch?

40:14.466 --> 40:15.666
Not just Scotch.

40:15.701 --> 40:16.934
That's 30-year-old Scotch.

40:16.969 --> 40:18.102
Single malt, too.

40:18.137 --> 40:19.670
Angela would say
that traditionally

40:19.705 --> 40:21.472
a husband buys
his wife flowers.

40:21.507 --> 40:23.074
Yeah, that's true.
But you know what?

40:23.108 --> 40:24.809
This is not for my wife.

40:24.843 --> 40:28.346
This is for my partner,
who I occasionally kiss.

40:31.750 --> 40:32.984
(chuckles)

40:33.018 --> 40:35.086
Johannessen is in custody?
Yep.

40:35.120 --> 40:38.523
Largely because of my partner.

40:38.557 --> 40:40.725
So what's going on here?
What is this?

40:40.759 --> 40:44.562
I revisited the life insurance
company's calculations

40:44.596 --> 40:47.131
about the level of risk
I assume in the field.

40:47.166 --> 40:51.369
I factored in my many
considerable strengths, but...

40:51.403 --> 40:54.338
their numbers
are correct.

40:54.373 --> 40:55.740
Okay, so you're okay with them

40:55.774 --> 40:57.442
slapping a higher
premium on you?

40:59.178 --> 41:01.145
It's rational.
Hmm.

41:01.180 --> 41:02.980
And I can't argue
with rationality.

41:03.015 --> 41:04.582
Right.
The universe demonstrates

41:04.616 --> 41:06.584
that no matter how
we protect ourselves,

41:06.618 --> 41:09.487
we will never be
completely safe.

41:09.521 --> 41:14.225
But... with reasonable caution,

41:14.259 --> 41:18.663
we can still be together
in the field, when appropriate.

41:18.697 --> 41:20.531
And you're willing
to pay extra for that?

41:20.566 --> 41:23.167
Always.

41:23.202 --> 41:26.103
Like I'm willing to pay
extra for the Scotch.

41:26.138 --> 41:28.306
And that's why I love you.

41:30.876 --> 41:32.143
(sighs)

41:32.177 --> 41:33.744
(laughs)

41:33.779 --> 41:37.759
Come on, let's have
a Scotch night. Huh?  (laughs)

41:37.760 --> 41:39.855
Tell me a story.
A Scotch story?

41:39.856 --> 41:41.490
Well, it's got to
be 30 years old...
