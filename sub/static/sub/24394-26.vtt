07:23.531 --> 07:25.948
Well, we believe that
the immigration court system

07:28.240 --> 07:30.281

07:30.365 --> 07:33.614
the executive branch's
law enforcement policies.

07:33.697 --> 07:37.822
So, it certainly predates
this administration,
but more recently,

07:37.906 --> 07:41.114

07:47.365 --> 07:51.114
and who are seeking
asylum or protection,

07:51.198 --> 07:54.240
and the backlog is because
the court has been mismanaged

07:54.323 --> 07:56.240

We're looking for
the Marfan mutation

16:13.906 --> 16:16.198
that was inserted
into the mouse.

16:16.281 --> 16:18.156
So, she's gonna take
a small piece of their tail,

16:18.240 --> 16:20.448
and that's gonna be analyzed
to see if the gene is there.

16:20.531 --> 16:22.323
And so what I'm gonna
do with these mice,

16:22.406 --> 16:23.948
if they have
the Marfan trait,

16:24.031 --> 16:25.989
is treat them
with a specific drug.

16:26.572 --> 16:27.906
We have fish. We have frogs,

16:27.989 --> 16:30.864
bats, owls, rabbits,
guinea pigs,

16:30.948 --> 16:32.448
multiple species of monkey,

16:32.531 --> 16:33.906
pigs, dogs, cats...

16:35.031 --> 16:36.198
No sheep right now.

16:36.281 --> 16:38.864
We have rats in here.
You wanna see rats?

16:38.948 --> 16:40.490
Sure.

16:40.572 --> 16:42.739
Adams:
A mouse is good as
far as genetics go,

16:42.822 --> 16:44.198
-all that stuff.
-Yeah.

16:44.281 --> 16:47.114
But if you wanna
do surgery on them,
they're only this big.

16:47.198 --> 16:50.531
So, you can do more things with
a rat than you can with a mouse.

16:50.614 --> 16:52.989
You can use a hundred
rather than two monkeys.

16:53.073 --> 16:54.572
Monkeys are extremely expensive.

16:55.198 --> 16:57.448
These were about $7,000.

16:58.490 --> 17:00.572
-Gandhi: Would you
sell me a monkey--
-Adams: No.

17:01.406 --> 17:04.448
We have some of our monkeys
on treatments every day,

17:04.531 --> 17:07.614
and the one thing we found,
that when they're tired
of everything else,

17:07.697 --> 17:09.948
they'll still eat
the Starbursts.

17:13.031 --> 17:14.614

-So, that's the knee
from another pig.

17:21.448 --> 17:23.156
-Yep.

17:23.240 --> 17:26.490
That knee is no different
than transplanting a kidney...

17:26.572 --> 17:28.864

17:28.948 --> 17:30.365

17:32.448 --> 17:34.281
there's something going
on by looking at that.

17:35.781 --> 17:37.531
Gandhi:
When it comes to
development of medicines

17:37.614 --> 17:39.739
in the United States
and around the world,

17:39.822 --> 17:42.572
why is this center
and other centers like this

17:42.656 --> 17:44.156
important to that process?

17:44.240 --> 17:46.490
Adams:
Well, in the United States,
most biomedical research

17:46.572 --> 17:48.948
is done at
institutions like this.

17:49.031 --> 17:51.365
Pharmaceutical companies,
you know, they talk about

17:51.448 --> 17:54.781
how many billions of dollars
it costs to produce a drug,

17:54.864 --> 17:56.531
to develop a drug.

17:56.614 --> 17:59.365
So they're not--
While they do basic research,

17:59.448 --> 18:02.073
a lot of the basic
research is done here.

18:02.156 --> 18:04.156
And then, if it looks
like it's gonna work out,

18:04.240 --> 18:06.822
then it'll go up
to the higher level
to a pharmaceutical company.

18:06.906 --> 18:09.614
Gandhi:
Once the safety
and efficacy of a new drug

18:09.697 --> 18:11.448
is determined through
animal research,

18:11.531 --> 18:13.697
the pre-clinical phase ends,

18:13.781 --> 18:16.198
and the drug moves on
to FDA clinical trials.

18:16.281 --> 18:18.739
In order to gain
FDA approval,

18:18.822 --> 18:20.614
pharmaceutical companies
need to make it through

18:20.697 --> 18:22.781
multiple phases
of clinical trials

18:22.864 --> 18:25.448
to find out how the drug
affects human beings.

18:26.198 --> 18:28.073
For much of the 20th century,

18:28.156 --> 18:30.948
medical experiments were
conducted on prisoners.

18:31.031 --> 18:34.448
Holmesburg Prison
in Pennsylvania
was one such facility,

18:34.531 --> 18:37.240
where inmates were
the subjects of testing.

18:37.323 --> 18:40.114
Author Allen Hornblum
took us on a tour

18:40.198 --> 18:42.198
of the now shuttered prison.

18:42.281 --> 18:45.365
Hornblum:
This is H block,
and H block was the block

18:45.448 --> 18:47.406
that was taken
over by the doctors

18:47.490 --> 18:49.281
at the University
of Pennsylvania,

18:49.365 --> 18:51.240
who used it to

18:51.323 --> 18:54.906
develop all sorts of ointments
and chemicals and things.

18:54.989 --> 18:57.281
Gandhi:
So, this is really...

18:57.365 --> 19:00.572
I mean, it's a prison, but in
some ways, this is a laboratory.

19:00.656 --> 19:02.365
Hornblum:
This county prison became

19:02.448 --> 19:07.281
an adjunct of the University of
Pennsylvania's medical school.

19:07.365 --> 19:10.822
You had two, three dozen
different experiments

19:10.906 --> 19:14.822
for different private
and public sector operations,

19:14.906 --> 19:17.697
including the US Army.

19:17.781 --> 19:21.781
By 1974,
news about the experiments here

19:21.864 --> 19:24.490
become so negative,
so problematic,

19:24.572 --> 19:26.697
that the city
leaders shut it down.

19:26.781 --> 19:30.572
That was replicated at similar
facilities around the country.

19:30.656 --> 19:33.656
Gandhi:
But a growing
pharmaceutical industry

19:33.739 --> 19:36.739
still needed to test new
drugs on humans subjects.

19:36.822 --> 19:39.156
So, for the first phase
of clinical testing,

19:39.240 --> 19:43.156
they now hire clinical researh
organizations, or CROs,

19:43.240 --> 19:45.156
which do the work of
finding participants

19:45.240 --> 19:46.448
and running the tests.

19:46.906 --> 19:49.240
The biggest CRO
is Covance, Inc.,

19:49.323 --> 19:52.073
which has over 80
facilities around the world.

19:52.531 --> 19:54.031
We went to Evansville, Indian,

19:54.114 --> 19:56.864
to meet some clinical
trial participants.

20:01.531 --> 20:02.906
Every study,
you'll hear about

20:02.989 --> 20:04.822
that study where
they cut off your toe,

20:04.906 --> 20:07.948
and sew it back, and you get,
like, lots of money.

20:08.031 --> 20:09.156
That's not real.

20:09.240 --> 20:10.948
It's just one of those
urban myth things.

20:11.739 --> 20:14.448

I'm at the Corner Pocket

I've done 30-plus studies.

20:27.989 --> 20:30.323
I mean, I used to not even
look at studies below $4,000.

20:30.406 --> 20:32.531
-Wow, okay.
-Some drugs are more
profitable than others.

20:32.614 --> 20:35.031
I don't have a whole lot
of other career options.

20:35.114 --> 20:36.989

20:37.073 --> 20:38.697

20:45.864 --> 20:47.240

and my eyebrows.

21:03.323 --> 21:04.656

these drugs for so many years

21:07.448 --> 21:09.406
has affected you
physically or mentally?

21:09.490 --> 21:11.572
