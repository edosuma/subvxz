WEBVTT

00:10.400 --> 00:11.734
Your door's wonky.

00:11.800 --> 00:13.567
Yeah. I need to get the hinges adjusted.

00:13.633 --> 00:15.166
- Double Chai tea? - Thank you.

00:15.233 --> 00:16.899
You've got a little something.

00:16.966 --> 00:18.734
Oh, yeah. The frost is melting off the roof,

00:18.800 --> 00:20.233
And this is my favorite coat.

00:20.300 --> 00:21.643
Do you sell water repellent?

00:21.643 --> 00:24.266
Yeah. I sell vintage water repellent

00:24.333 --> 00:25.866
And used shoe polish.

00:25.933 --> 00:26.915
Ok. Fine.

00:26.915 --> 00:28.123
It doesn't hurt to ask.

00:28.123 --> 00:29.841
Excuse me. Cutler and Banks?

00:29.841 --> 00:31.164
You know, the realtors next door?

00:31.164 --> 00:32.296
As a matter of fact, I do.

00:32.296 --> 00:33.455
Any clue when they'll be in?

00:33.455 --> 00:34.463
Delia's out of town for the week.

00:34.466 --> 00:36.686
She's Banks, as in Banks and Cutler.

00:36.686 --> 00:38.272
- Ok, thanks.  - Well, wait a minute.

00:38.272 --> 00:39.300
Do you want to leave your info?

00:39.300 --> 00:41.062
'cause I talk to her, like, every day.

00:41.062 --> 00:42.433
Ok.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.634
Well, I'm looking for a loft for my office.

00:45.701 --> 00:46.801
Uh, studio, really.

00:46.867 --> 00:48.134
- I draw.  - Are you an artist?

00:48.201 --> 00:49.601
A graphic novelist, actually.

00:49.668 --> 00:52.749
So I need a place that gets good light, is quiet.

00:52.749 --> 00:54.301
I'm in the Bradford Building now, and, uh...

00:54.368 --> 00:56.000
Oh, a friend of mine works over there.

00:56.067 --> 00:57.701
That place is amazing.

00:57.768 --> 00:59.867
- Why are you leaving?  - Mine's...well,

00:59.934 --> 01:01.835
Just not working out for me. It's hard to explain.

01:01.900 --> 01:03.401
Are you famous?

01:03.468 --> 01:05.367
Would we have heard of you?

01:05.434 --> 01:09.234
I doubt it. I have kind of a cult readership.

01:09.301 --> 01:10.634
My name's Damon Weaver.

01:10.701 --> 01:13.967
Sorry. Don't know you.

01:14.034 --> 01:15.835
Have you written anything popular I may have heard of?

01:15.900 --> 01:17.827
I've got a new book coming out with some hype.

01:17.827 --> 01:19.735
- It's called "Destined."  - Doesn't ring a bell.

01:19.801 --> 01:22.201
Well, because, like he just said, it hasn't come out yet.

01:22.267 --> 01:23.634
Have you written anything else?

01:24.182 --> 01:26.735
I also wrote "Transcender" a few years ago.

01:26.801 --> 01:27.867
Nah, haven't read that, either.

01:27.934 --> 01:29.201
Eli!

01:29.267 --> 01:31.234
But I have heard some of my students talk about it.

01:31.301 --> 01:33.201
So you are famous. See? You feel better now?

01:33.267 --> 01:35.768
I feel fine. But hey, if it'll make you feel any better,

01:35.835 --> 01:37.827
I've got some fliers.

01:37.827 --> 01:39.934
It's for a signing I'm doing this week for the new book

01:40.000 --> 01:42.267
over at Bay Ridge booksellers.

01:42.334 --> 01:43.701
Frankly, I could use a crowd.

01:43.768 --> 01:45.368
Don't you worry, my famous friend.

01:45.434 --> 01:46.701
We'll get you a crowd.

01:46.768 --> 01:49.501
"Destined." I like the title.

01:49.568 --> 01:51.401
Well, I would be happy to put one in the window.

01:51.468 --> 01:53.501
Thanks so much. Oh!

01:53.568 --> 01:55.601
And here's my number.

01:55.668 --> 01:57.900
Tell your realtor friend to give me a call, Miss...

01:57.967 --> 02:00.900
Uh, Melinda Gordon, and this is Eli James.

02:00.967 --> 02:03.134
See you.

02:05.668 --> 02:08.234
Oh, let me help you with that thing. It's...

02:08.300 --> 02:10.501
Impossible.

02:10.568 --> 02:14.368
Eli. Eli, wait. There's a trick to it.

02:14.434 --> 02:16.468
Thank you.

02:16.534 --> 02:18.934
You're welcome.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.301
Hey, the frost is melting.

02:26.134 --> 02:28.967
Except not on you. You're sparkling.

02:31.234 --> 02:34.067
That's weird. The drops are turning into ice.

02:34.134 --> 02:35.601
How the heck does that happen?

02:35.668 --> 02:37.534
It must be colder outside than it feels.

02:37.601 --> 02:39.101
The radio said it's already in the fifties.

02:39.167 --> 02:41.101
Well, then, they were wrong.

02:46.534 --> 02:48.468
- Oh, my god.  - What the...

02:54.167 --> 02:55.900
That almost hit you. Are you ok?

02:55.967 --> 02:58.000
Oh, I'm fine.

03:00.167 --> 03:01.768
I got to go.

03:04.034 --> 03:05.301
Did you do that?

03:05.368 --> 03:07.334
Who are you?

03:07.401 --> 03:08.401
What are you trying to do?

03:08.468 --> 03:11.034
He's a liar and a thief.

03:12.067 --> 03:14.401
But he'll get what he deserves.

03:57.071 --> 03:58.959
How come my building is the only one with icicles on it?

03:59.000 --> 04:01.046
And why was the ghost wearing a ski mask?

04:01.046 --> 04:02.739
Look, if you got a theory, don't hold back.

04:02.739 --> 04:03.992
Just spit it out.

04:03.992 --> 04:05.828
Jim and I are thinking hypothermia.

04:05.828 --> 04:07.234
But something still bothers me.

04:07.300 --> 04:08.634
So the guy is frozen to death.

04:08.701 --> 04:11.934
He creates icicles and freezes drops of water on Damon's coat.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.033
Who does that?

04:14.100 --> 04:16.490
You've got a theory, right?

04:16.490 --> 04:19.334
Well, actually, no. I've got nothing.

04:19.894 --> 04:22.100
Because I got a theory, but if you're just gonna mock me...

04:22.167 --> 04:24.434
- Eli.  - Ok, fine.

04:24.501 --> 04:26.085
Do you want to know who does that?

04:26.085 --> 04:27.558
Supervillains do that.

04:27.558 --> 04:29.834
Their powers hearken back to what killed them, or almost did.

04:29.901 --> 04:32.103
Poison Ivy, Two-Face, Elektra.

04:32.103 --> 04:34.824
That's Damon's world. He's a graphic novelist.

04:34.824 --> 04:36.316
You're not mocking me.

04:36.316 --> 04:38.328
- What are you looking at?  - It's damon's blog.

04:38.328 --> 04:40.654
He's been posting drawings to tease his new graphic novel.

04:40.654 --> 04:42.338
Check out the latest.

04:43.901 --> 04:46.191
That character's about to get skewered by icicles.

04:46.191 --> 04:47.527
Yeah. You notice anything else?

04:47.527 --> 04:49.009
Yeah. He looks a lot like Damon.

04:49.009 --> 04:51.460
I guess he draws from experience... art imitating life.

04:51.460 --> 04:54.501
Or the other way around. Take a look at when that drawing was posted.

04:54.567 --> 04:57.133
Monday, 7 A.M.

04:58.684 --> 05:00.245
Today's Tuesday.

05:00.245 --> 05:03.466
So this was drawn before Damon ever set foot in my store.

05:03.466 --> 05:05.183
Maybe that explains why he took off so quickly.

05:05.183 --> 05:07.534
He recognized that near-miss from his own illustration.

05:07.601 --> 05:09.624
He did seem a little freaked out.

05:09.624 --> 05:11.562
I wonder if this kind of thing's happened before.

05:11.562 --> 05:13.634
Does that mean he can foretell the future through his art?

05:13.701 --> 05:15.067
No one can foretell the future,

05:15.133 --> 05:16.667
But the ghost probably saw Damon's drawing

05:16.734 --> 05:18.100
And reenacted it somehow.

05:18.100 --> 05:19.805
So the ghost reads graphic novel blogs,

05:19.805 --> 05:21.296
Acts like a supervillain?

05:21.296 --> 05:23.567
Sounds like someone who's way into comic books.

05:23.634 --> 05:25.634
Yeah. Looks like we need to get into them, too.

05:25.701 --> 05:26.587
Oh, look no further.

05:26.587 --> 05:28.856
Rockland's got an A to Z encyclopedia of comics.

05:28.856 --> 05:30.223
At the university library?

05:30.223 --> 05:32.958
Nope. She's in the Anthropology Department.

05:34.732 --> 05:36.645
I am not obsessed with comic books.

05:36.645 --> 05:38.968
I am an anthropologist, and graphic novels...

05:39.033 --> 05:40.913
which are not comic books, by the way...

05:40.913 --> 05:45.501
Are a window into an entire generation's passions and frustrations

05:45.567 --> 05:47.601
And...

05:47.667 --> 05:51.115
I just dig 'em, ok? They speak to me.

05:51.115 --> 05:52.855
They have since I was an angsty teen

05:52.856 --> 05:54.794
who did not fit into the world.

05:55.499 --> 05:56.955
And a lot of my clothes.

05:56.955 --> 05:58.205
And I happen to know

05:58.205 --> 06:01.446
that you are a closet fan of those gushy undead teen novels.

06:01.446 --> 06:05.105
I was doing research for a paper on teenage disaffection.

06:05.105 --> 06:08.258
I saw you crying into your popcorn at "Twilight," professor.

06:08.258 --> 06:08.908
You know what?

06:08.908 --> 06:10.734
Let's just deal with the ghost at hand.

06:10.801 --> 06:14.071
Well, the first thing I can tell you

06:14.071 --> 06:16.172
is if someone is haunting Damon Weaver,

06:16.172 --> 06:18.426
That's the most attention he's had

06:18.426 --> 06:19.675
since he put out his last book 2 years ago.

06:19.675 --> 06:20.720
What do you mean?

06:20.720 --> 06:22.760
His career is dead as a doornail.

06:25.903 --> 06:27.035
Am I offending anyone?

06:27.035 --> 06:28.824
No, no ghosts. Just us.

06:28.824 --> 06:30.297
I used to read his stuff,

06:30.297 --> 06:32.327
But then his plotlines got stale.

06:32.327 --> 06:33.901
It was like he ran out of ideas,

06:33.968 --> 06:35.657
And I think readers could tell.

06:35.657 --> 06:36.917
He fell off the map.

06:36.917 --> 06:38.347
So what about his new book?

06:38.347 --> 06:39.951
Is that gonna put him back on the map?

06:39.951 --> 06:41.567
If it's any good.

06:42.049 --> 06:43.701
Are you sure this is about a ghost?

06:43.767 --> 06:45.739
You mean, aside from the fact that we talked to one?

06:46.779 --> 06:48.202
Yeah, why would you ask that?

06:48.202 --> 06:50.215
Damon needs this book to sell.

06:50.442 --> 06:51.854
He needs the publicity.

06:52.016 --> 06:54.705
Oh, so the icicle thing was a stunt to get people's attention?

06:54.705 --> 06:56.293
Other artists have tried it.

06:56.293 --> 06:57.791
It got your attention.

06:57.791 --> 07:00.126
Someone did make sure it was on his blog.

07:00.337 --> 07:02.355
Come on. You're not really buying into this, are you?

07:02.355 --> 07:04.094
We met the ghost. He's real.

07:04.094 --> 07:05.160
He's real mad, too.

07:05.200 --> 07:06.868
Ok, but what is he mad about?

07:06.934 --> 07:11.167
I mean, what if this all does actually have to do with Damon's new book?

07:36.728 --> 07:37.707
Wha...

07:50.000 --> 07:52.020
It's kind of a bad time right now!

07:55.128 --> 07:56.297
Sorry to barge in.

07:56.297 --> 07:59.191
I just came to see if you opted to leave this space.

08:00.413 --> 08:03.200
'cause if you were leaving, I was thinking I could maybe take it myself.

08:05.968 --> 08:07.838
- Eli, right?  - Yeah.

08:07.838 --> 08:10.950
Yeah. I'm out of here as soon as I find a new studio.

08:10.950 --> 08:14.829
Ok. Well, you probably shouldn't trash the place on the way out.

08:14.829 --> 08:16.328
You might lose the deposit.

08:16.328 --> 08:19.503
The ice maker just decided to go haywire.

08:19.503 --> 08:20.914
I don't know what's wrong with it.

08:22.767 --> 08:24.033
Ice maker, huh?

08:24.100 --> 08:25.868
Yeah.

08:29.834 --> 08:31.537
There something else I can do for you?

08:31.537 --> 08:34.000
Maybe. See, I couldn't help notice the drawing

08:34.067 --> 08:36.125
that you posted on your blog yesterday.

08:36.469 --> 08:39.356
It looked a lot like what happened to you outside Melinda's shop.

08:39.356 --> 08:42.575
The only thing is you drew it before we ran into you.

08:43.669 --> 08:44.737
What are you talking about?

08:44.737 --> 08:46.333
The time stamp on your post,

08:46.333 --> 08:49.734
It was way before the icicles almost actually clocked you.

08:49.801 --> 08:52.367
Oh, my site must be buggy again.

08:54.234 --> 08:56.969
Thanks for the heads-up. I'll get my I.T. Guy on it.

08:58.234 --> 09:00.772
That's ice flying at you.

09:01.635 --> 09:03.899
Yeah, let me save you the phone call, damon.

09:04.280 --> 09:05.425
I have a gift,

09:05.425 --> 09:08.095
A superpower, if that can help you relate.

09:08.095 --> 09:09.900
I communicate with ghosts,

09:09.900 --> 09:13.033
And so does Melinda, the woman you met who owns the antique store.

09:13.100 --> 09:15.634
And the truth is you got one.

09:15.701 --> 09:18.868
A ghost, I mean, not an antique store.

09:18.868 --> 09:19.970
You're putting me on, right?

09:19.970 --> 09:20.956
I wish I were.

09:20.956 --> 09:22.673
The ghost Melinda saw was wearing a trench coat,

09:22.673 --> 09:24.937
A ski mask and has a thing for ice.

09:24.937 --> 09:27.006
It's possible he may have frozen to death.

09:27.006 --> 09:28.512
Sound like anyone you know?

09:30.031 --> 09:31.506
Eli, what'd you say your last name was?

09:31.506 --> 09:33.506
James. Why?

09:33.506 --> 09:36.667
Just wanna make sure I get it right for the restraining order.

10:08.586 --> 10:09.876
What the hell?

11:30.560 --> 11:32.134
What's happening to me?

12:02.496 --> 12:03.796
Is that guy in trouble?

12:03.863 --> 12:06.130
Oh, not if mommy can help it.

12:06.458 --> 12:08.163
I wanna see what happens next.

12:08.163 --> 12:11.063
What happens next is you go and get ready for school.

12:11.130 --> 12:12.063
No fair.

12:12.130 --> 12:13.330
March.

12:15.596 --> 12:16.629
What was that about?

12:17.471 --> 12:18.833
Oh, I'm the world's meanest mom

12:18.833 --> 12:20.268
because I didn't want him to see this.

12:20.268 --> 12:21.971
It's true.

12:23.426 --> 12:24.628
I can't believe this stuff

12:24.628 --> 12:27.178
has replaced the "Archies" of my youth.

12:27.178 --> 12:30.729
Isn't that your graphic novelist about to be run over by a car?

12:30.796 --> 12:32.340
Or attacked by this guy.

12:32.340 --> 12:33.675
The kid with a knife?

12:33.675 --> 12:34.977
- He your ghost?  - No.

12:34.977 --> 12:37.653
Ghost outside the store was wearing a ski mask and trench coat,

12:37.653 --> 12:39.566
And I still don't have a clue who he might be.

12:39.566 --> 12:42.295
Um, that's because I didn't wanna wake you when I came in.

12:42.295 --> 12:43.716
I asked around the ER.

12:43.716 --> 12:47.050
They only treated one case of hypothermia this season,

12:47.360 --> 12:49.202
And that man is now alive and well

12:49.202 --> 12:51.733
and living retired in sunny Florida.

12:52.271 --> 12:54.591
Maybe Damon should consider retiring, too,

12:54.591 --> 12:57.883
At least until I can convince this ghost to stop recreating what he draws.

12:58.230 --> 13:00.363
You mean more than the icicles outside of your store?

13:00.429 --> 13:02.929
Yeah. Eli told me Damon drew himself being pelted by ice

13:02.929 --> 13:04.976
right before the ice maker in his studio exploded.

13:04.976 --> 13:06.590
And I've been checking the blog for new art

13:06.590 --> 13:08.397
to see what else the ghost might have in store.

13:08.397 --> 13:10.963
Maybe Damon should just draw himself into harmless scenes,

13:11.030 --> 13:12.570
You know, like, in a home, doors locked,

13:12.570 --> 13:14.363
Away from cars and crowds.

13:15.066 --> 13:16.211
Wait a minute.

13:17.184 --> 13:19.341
In the crowd, that's him. That's the ghost.

13:19.341 --> 13:22.434
I thought Damon told Eli he didn't know anyone fitting that description.

13:22.434 --> 13:24.836
And yet Damon drew him exactly the way I saw him,

13:24.836 --> 13:27.895
Which either means he lied, or there's something I'm missing.

13:29.980 --> 13:31.515
Well, you're not the only one in the dark.

13:31.515 --> 13:33.143
Check out these fan comments.

13:33.143 --> 13:34.605
"new characters out of left field.

13:34.605 --> 13:36.513
"no connection to the upcoming novel.

13:36.513 --> 13:38.330
"is there a part of another new collaboration?

13:38.397 --> 13:39.715
Answer us, Damon.

13:39.715 --> 13:42.330
Who are backpack boy and ski mask man?"

13:44.163 --> 13:46.629
And no response from the artist himself.

13:46.696 --> 13:49.436
Well, if Damon won't answer his fans,

13:49.436 --> 13:51.267
maybe he'll answer me.

13:52.628 --> 13:54.510
I'm just telling you if you don't want this to happen,

13:54.510 --> 13:55.910
you should start talking to me.

13:55.910 --> 13:59.863
Because you and your friend think a ghost can make this come true.

14:00.323 --> 14:01.899
You've been reading too many comics.

14:01.899 --> 14:05.327
Look, I think the ghost is taking cues from your drawings.

14:05.327 --> 14:06.843
I mean, the icicles outside my store,

14:06.843 --> 14:07.936
Your ice maker...

14:07.936 --> 14:11.030
He's looking at your artwork and bringing it to life.

14:11.348 --> 14:12.705
How is that even possible?

14:12.705 --> 14:14.362
Ghosts can make things malfunction.

14:14.362 --> 14:16.163
They can also mess with temperature.

14:16.230 --> 14:17.562
Look, whatever's happening in your studio,

14:17.629 --> 14:19.747
it's not gonna stop just because you move.

14:19.747 --> 14:21.042
You're being haunted,

14:21.042 --> 14:23.155
And if you deny that, it's not gonna help you.

14:24.291 --> 14:26.318
What else can ghosts do?

14:26.809 --> 14:28.330
Well, if your last drawing was any indication,

14:28.397 --> 14:31.263
You might wanna stop drawing yourself into the panels.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.610
I wish I could.

14:34.364 --> 14:35.677
What are you talking about?

14:35.677 --> 14:37.209
I'd say this is gonna sound crazy,

14:37.209 --> 14:39.676
but you and your friends see ghosts.

14:39.911 --> 14:41.452
The icicle panel,

14:41.452 --> 14:43.212
I have no memory of drawing it.

14:43.723 --> 14:44.967
What do you mean?

14:46.142 --> 14:48.230
I'll be at my desk working

14:48.297 --> 14:50.581
when I black out or lose track of time.

14:50.581 --> 14:52.009
I'm not sure, but when I come to,

14:52.009 --> 14:53.496
I've got a new drawing

14:53.496 --> 14:54.855
sketched, inked,

14:54.855 --> 14:56.568
and uploaded to my blog.

14:56.914 --> 14:58.879
Ok, so if you didn't post those drawings,

14:58.879 --> 15:01.094
Then the time stamp wasn't an error,

15:01.257 --> 15:02.596
Which means that the ghost is telling you

15:02.663 --> 15:04.917
what he's gonna do to you before it happens.

15:05.587 --> 15:08.323
Have you ever heard of automatic writing or drawing?

15:08.949 --> 15:10.251
When someone forces you to draw something.

15:10.251 --> 15:12.166
You mean like channeling another artist?

15:12.719 --> 15:13.714
I've heard of it.

15:13.714 --> 15:14.701
You're saying it's real?

15:14.701 --> 15:16.515
It's a form of possession,

15:16.515 --> 15:18.554
And I think you know it's real.

15:20.590 --> 15:24.338
So he makes me draw how he's gonna haunt me?

15:24.338 --> 15:25.997
- Why?  - To scare you.

15:26.399 --> 15:27.411
To punish you, for what,

15:27.411 --> 15:30.003
Only the ghost knows, unless you have a guess.

15:30.003 --> 15:31.466
I could use some air.

15:31.818 --> 15:34.829
Damon, look, please.

15:38.856 --> 15:40.416
Look, I know that you didn't draw him.

15:40.416 --> 15:43.660
I just need to know if you recognize the ghost, the guy in the ski mask.

15:43.660 --> 15:45.156
No, I don't.

15:45.156 --> 15:46.811
But after Eli described him to me,

15:46.811 --> 15:49.819
when I saw him in the drawing, I got nervous.

15:49.819 --> 15:51.632
Ok, what about the kid with the orange backpack?

15:51.632 --> 15:53.062
Yeah, and the knife.

15:53.062 --> 15:55.007
No, I've never seen that kid before either.

15:55.313 --> 15:57.754
Can you think of anyone who might be angry with you?

15:57.754 --> 16:00.263
Like upset fans or other artists, maybe?

16:00.330 --> 16:02.601
The new book is totally different for me...

16:02.601 --> 16:03.729
new styles, new characters...

16:03.994 --> 16:05.596
And not everybody is happy with that.

16:05.663 --> 16:08.308
So take your pick.  My fans, my rivals,

16:08.308 --> 16:09.475
Everyone's gunning for me.

16:09.475 --> 16:11.186
But if any of them have died recently,

16:11.186 --> 16:12.596
I haven't heard about it.

16:13.270 --> 16:16.606
Bottom line, I have no idea who this ghost is.

16:16.781 --> 16:19.263
Just please tell him to leave me alone.

16:30.383 --> 16:31.729
Damon, wait!

16:32.770 --> 16:33.775
Stop!

16:37.596 --> 16:39.963
I'm so sorry. I don't know what happened.

17:51.690 --> 17:52.908
Are you ok?

17:52.908 --> 17:54.167
I think so.

17:56.196 --> 17:59.330
Hey! Hey, wait!

18:02.582 --> 18:05.663
Did you see that kid with the orange backpack?

18:05.729 --> 18:09.429
No, but I'm not sticking around for him to come back.

18:21.555 --> 18:24.548
I'm not finding any recent reports of people falling through the ice,

18:24.548 --> 18:26.963
but I'm pretty sure that's how the ghost died.

18:27.030 --> 18:28.299
Hence the ice hauntings.

18:28.299 --> 18:29.732
Maybe he hasn't been found.

18:29.732 --> 18:31.490
Damon has nothing to say on the matter?

18:31.490 --> 18:33.930
At least he finally admitted to the automatic drawing.

18:33.996 --> 18:36.130
Well, I loosened him up for you.

18:37.063 --> 18:39.143
Hey, Melinda.

18:39.513 --> 18:41.488
I didn't realize you were visiting.

18:42.223 --> 18:45.030
You just happened to be passing my office with an armload of comics?

18:45.096 --> 18:48.030
Uh, yeah, I was just cleaning out my desk and...

18:48.960 --> 18:51.625
Ok. Well, I saw your car outside,

18:51.927 --> 18:53.888
and come on. I teach anthro of the occult,

18:53.888 --> 18:55.323
and you guys are messing with ghosts.

18:55.323 --> 18:56.940
I just wanted to hang.

18:57.250 --> 18:58.261
No problem.

18:58.261 --> 18:59.490
I'm not sure that those are gonna help.

18:59.490 --> 19:01.196
The ghost seems to be drawing his own scenes.

19:01.837 --> 19:04.919
So damon's latest blog panel came true?

19:04.919 --> 19:06.152
Most of it.

19:06.152 --> 19:08.368
Melinda saw the ghost and the boy with the backpack.

19:08.368 --> 19:09.903
Except he wasn't holding a knife.

19:09.903 --> 19:12.170
Well, irrelevant. I mean, you weren't in the drawing either,

19:12.170 --> 19:13.697
but you were there when it happened.

19:13.697 --> 19:16.761
That's a good point. Maybe you being there is the only thing that saved Damon.

19:16.761 --> 19:19.958
Yeah, I think this ghost wants to torment damon, not just injure him.

19:19.958 --> 19:21.626
Right. Why else would the ghost give him

19:21.626 --> 19:23.097
a sneak preview on his blog every day?

19:23.163 --> 19:24.757
Who would do something like that?

19:24.757 --> 19:26.343
Someone who's angry and confused

19:26.343 --> 19:28.451
and quite honestly has me confused.

19:28.615 --> 19:29.387
How so?

19:29.387 --> 19:30.963
The ghost showed me his death,

19:31.030 --> 19:33.151
and he was trapped underwater below the ice.

19:33.413 --> 19:34.584
Like he fell through.

19:34.584 --> 19:36.263
Yeah, except the strange thing is is that the holes

19:36.330 --> 19:38.037
were not big enough for him to have fallen through.

19:38.037 --> 19:40.306
I mean, they were very small, perfectly round holes

19:40.306 --> 19:41.696
that looked like they had been carved.

19:41.696 --> 19:43.612
Yeah, like ice fishing holes.

19:45.922 --> 19:47.058
Oh, you guys have never been?

19:47.058 --> 19:48.707
Trust me. I wish I hadn't either.

19:48.707 --> 19:51.549
My dad thought it would make for great father-daughter bonding.

19:51.549 --> 19:53.178
He would schlep us out every winter

19:53.178 --> 19:55.163
to some lake in Stanton that was stocked with fish.

19:55.230 --> 19:56.902
Never caught anything but a cold.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.374
Stanton's nearby.

19:58.374 --> 20:00.859
Yeah, it's the only lake around that's sanctioned for the sport,

20:00.859 --> 20:02.527
and it's almost the end of the season,

20:02.527 --> 20:04.562
and when the ice melts, it gets really thin.

20:04.629 --> 20:06.600
Right, but if it was frozen, the ghost's body could

20:06.600 --> 20:08.581
still be trapped underneath there.

20:09.022 --> 20:10.248
His dead body?

20:12.267 --> 20:14.063
What do you guys do with that kind of information?

20:14.130 --> 20:15.997
Mm, good question, Mel.

20:15.997 --> 20:17.501
What do we do with that information?

20:17.501 --> 20:18.651
Detective Blair is gone.

20:18.651 --> 20:20.978
Detective Simon was less than happy to make our acquaintance.

20:20.978 --> 20:22.629
If we turn in another tip on a dead body,

20:22.696 --> 20:24.297
we'll be visiting a very different set of bars

20:24.363 --> 20:26.764
than I'd prefer on a Friday night.

20:26.764 --> 20:29.317
Well, I'll call 911.

20:29.317 --> 20:32.416
I'll say I spotted something at my dad's ice shanty

20:32.416 --> 20:34.060
while I was jigging for bluegills.

20:34.060 --> 20:35.580
Oh, that old excuse.

20:36.706 --> 20:37.952
We can't ask you to do that.

20:37.952 --> 20:39.010
You didn't ask,

20:39.010 --> 20:40.273
but I wanna call anyway.

20:40.273 --> 20:42.130
I'd want someone to do the same for me

20:42.130 --> 20:44.112
if I was frozen stiff under that ice.

20:47.530 --> 20:49.264
The police followed Avery's lead,

20:49.264 --> 20:50.914
and they found the body in the lake,

20:51.371 --> 20:53.177
but they're still trying to discover his identity.

20:53.177 --> 20:54.871
But he's young.

20:54.871 --> 20:56.447
Well, if he's been reported missing,

20:56.447 --> 20:58.063
they're gonna find out soon.

21:05.513 --> 21:06.763
Talk to me.

21:07.380 --> 21:09.346
Tell me what Damon has to do with all this.

21:09.346 --> 21:11.528
Damon took my life.

21:23.150 --> 21:25.624
Check it out. We made the front page.

21:26.096 --> 21:29.117
No. Sadly, a dead runaway kid named Shane Dunning did.

21:29.184 --> 21:30.284
You already knew the I.D. Of the ghost?

21:30.350 --> 21:31.584
Little thing called the internet.

21:31.651 --> 21:33.552
That and Jim filled me in after he talked to the coroner.

21:33.552 --> 21:35.390
Well, I bet he didn't mention this little tidbit.

21:35.390 --> 21:36.686
The lake where they found Shane's body...

21:36.686 --> 21:38.646
is less than a mile from Damon's house. I know.

21:38.646 --> 21:41.317
He's been living up there and commuting to his studio for about 10 years.

21:41.384 --> 21:42.625
How are you always one step ahead of me?

21:42.625 --> 21:44.359
Question is is it a coincidence?

21:44.359 --> 21:45.546
That you're always one step ahead?

21:45.546 --> 21:47.983
No, that we have a ghost saying Damon took his life

21:48.050 --> 21:50.474
and now the ghost turns up practically right next door to Damon's house.

21:50.474 --> 21:52.117
Damon said he never even saw the ghost,

21:52.117 --> 21:53.324
but he might just be a big, fat liar.

21:53.324 --> 21:55.350
I'm not sure. The ghost forced Damon to draw those pictures.

21:55.417 --> 21:56.476
He's trying to tell us something.

21:56.476 --> 21:57.870
That Damon killed him?

21:57.870 --> 22:00.125
By somehow luring him out onto thin ice, and why?

22:00.125 --> 22:02.170
I mean, there's no apparent connection between Shane and Damon.

22:02.170 --> 22:04.226
And what does the angry kid with the orange backpack

22:04.226 --> 22:05.654
have to do with any of it?

22:06.760 --> 22:08.152
Wait. Are you asking me?

22:08.152 --> 22:10.150
Nope. I'm gonna ask Shane's family.

22:14.150 --> 22:16.117
I don't even know why I try.

22:30.353 --> 22:31.847
Mr. And Mrs. Dunning.

22:31.847 --> 22:33.671
Hi. My name is Melinda Gordon,

22:33.671 --> 22:35.944
and I am so sorry for your loss.

22:36.471 --> 22:38.651
Are you the hospital grief counselor?

22:39.806 --> 22:41.152
Not exactly,

22:41.704 --> 22:43.254
but I think I can help.

22:48.117 --> 22:51.530
So you've actually seen, talked to my son since he...

22:51.530 --> 22:54.139
I know it's a lot to process.

22:54.322 --> 22:56.300
Is Shane here now?

22:56.300 --> 22:59.931
No, but I'm sure he's not very far.

23:00.635 --> 23:02.738
I just need to figure out what he's angry about

23:02.738 --> 23:05.024
or why he feels like he was wronged somehow.

23:05.024 --> 23:06.805
It's because of me.

23:07.079 --> 23:09.879
You can't keep beating yourself up, baby.

23:10.064 --> 23:12.417
We all tried our best with Shane.

23:13.750 --> 23:17.247
He had trouble at school and trouble at home.

23:17.533 --> 23:19.212
Shane's mother wasn't any help.

23:19.212 --> 23:22.083
She took off after the divorce.

23:22.150 --> 23:24.731
Shane never saw her again.

23:24.731 --> 23:26.445
That must have been hard on him.

23:26.445 --> 23:29.094
This is a second marriage for both of us.

23:29.582 --> 23:32.863
We tried to blend our families,

23:32.864 --> 23:33.983
but it wasn't easy.

23:34.832 --> 23:37.005
Shane seemed to take it the worst.

23:37.005 --> 23:38.584
We tried counseling.

23:38.651 --> 23:41.296
We worked with teachers and friends.

23:41.296 --> 23:43.267
Nothing helped.

23:43.267 --> 23:47.017
Did anything happen right before he ran away?

23:48.450 --> 23:49.417
A lot.

23:50.302 --> 23:53.917
There was a last straw, for me, anyway.

23:53.983 --> 23:56.556
It seems so small now.

23:57.649 --> 24:00.729
Shane found a preapproved credit card in the mail,

24:00.729 --> 24:03.323
and he opened an account in Jeff's name.

24:03.323 --> 24:05.932
When the bank called us and told us...

24:05.932 --> 24:07.337
I lost it.

24:07.792 --> 24:10.342
I was desperate to get through to him.

24:11.058 --> 24:12.534
I told Shane

24:12.534 --> 24:16.355
he had to either shape up or get out.

24:18.037 --> 24:22.241
I just thought if he was faced with an ultimatum, then...

24:27.317 --> 24:30.683
He decided to leave,

24:30.750 --> 24:33.284
and we never saw him again.

24:35.050 --> 24:36.584
U-until...

24:39.020 --> 24:39.913
I'm so sorry.

24:39.913 --> 24:44.017
I just wanted him to get on the right track in life.

24:45.850 --> 24:48.017
I didn't want to lose him.

24:52.551 --> 24:55.402
Would you tell Shane

24:56.418 --> 24:58.783
that we'd give anything to have him back again?

24:59.660 --> 25:00.910
Of course.

25:01.757 --> 25:03.392
When he's ready.

25:03.826 --> 25:07.188
Right now, I just have to figure out what's keeping him here.

25:08.312 --> 25:10.283
Look, I know that this is gonna sound strange,

25:10.283 --> 25:13.205
But I think it might have something to do with comic books.

25:13.748 --> 25:14.917
What?

25:14.917 --> 25:17.080
No, Shane hated comic books.

25:17.080 --> 25:19.420
He teased his stepbrother about it all the time.

25:20.020 --> 25:21.117
Stepbrother?

25:21.117 --> 25:23.857
My son colin from my first marriage.

25:23.857 --> 25:26.351
He's the one who loves graphic novels.

25:26.623 --> 25:28.033
Were they close?

25:29.777 --> 25:32.652
When we got married, Mariah and I hoped

25:32.652 --> 25:35.608
that it would bring them together,

25:35.608 --> 25:37.756
But it had the opposite effect.

25:37.756 --> 25:39.856
They fought a lot,

25:39.856 --> 25:42.793
So Colin mostly avoided Shane

25:42.793 --> 25:46.783
by hiding in his room all the time with his comics.

25:47.350 --> 25:48.910
There he is now.

25:52.617 --> 25:53.983
It's ok.

26:04.050 --> 26:06.317
I'm sorry to hear about your stepbrother.

26:06.384 --> 26:08.386
Your mom said that you and Shane weren't close,

26:08.386 --> 26:10.102
But I'm sure it's still hard for you.

26:10.102 --> 26:13.755
So you've really seen Shane, or his ghost or whatever?

26:13.755 --> 26:15.758
Yes, I have.

26:16.050 --> 26:17.417
He's angry.

26:17.484 --> 26:20.573
He said that damon weaver is a thief.

26:21.068 --> 26:23.245
I don't know what that meant, but you might.

26:23.734 --> 26:25.014
Not really.

26:25.987 --> 26:28.307
Ok, well, your mom said that you're the one who's into comics,

26:28.307 --> 26:31.930
And I saw you at Damon's studio, so you're a fan, right?

26:32.851 --> 26:34.090
Was.

26:34.240 --> 26:35.308
How come?

26:35.308 --> 26:39.584
Damon's new novel, it's mine,

26:39.651 --> 26:40.821
I think.

26:41.340 --> 26:42.619
What do you mean?

26:43.816 --> 26:46.817
I finished a graphic novel of my own.

26:46.817 --> 26:48.015
Did Shane know about it?

26:48.015 --> 26:49.532
Yeah. I never showed it to him,

26:49.533 --> 26:51.333
but he knew I was finishing one up.

26:51.333 --> 26:53.117
He thought it was lame.

26:53.184 --> 26:55.315
And then right before he left, he stole my laptop

26:55.315 --> 26:57.400
and all my original drawings.

26:58.329 --> 27:00.733
His way of taunting you one last time.

27:01.131 --> 27:02.944
That's what I thought,

27:02.944 --> 27:05.742
But then Damon Weaver releases a spoiler about his new book,

27:05.742 --> 27:08.218
And everything about it is just like mine...

27:08.218 --> 27:11.764
I mean, characters, the story, everything.

27:12.088 --> 27:14.562
So what are you saying, that Damon stole your story?

27:14.562 --> 27:16.738
Or Shane stole it and he sold it to Damon,

27:16.738 --> 27:18.622
Pretending it was his work.

27:19.651 --> 27:22.280
Is that when you started showing up in Damon's drawings?

27:22.280 --> 27:23.962
That's a new thing,

27:23.962 --> 27:25.826
Totally unrelated to my work.

27:26.238 --> 27:27.669
I mean, why would Damon Weaver draw me

27:27.669 --> 27:30.417
and my stepbrother into his blog comics?

27:31.958 --> 27:34.365
Actually, I think Shane's been doing it.

27:35.129 --> 27:36.152
What do you mean?

27:36.434 --> 27:39.750
I think that he's possessing Damon and making him do the drawings.

27:40.617 --> 27:42.217
Why would he do that?

27:42.284 --> 27:44.133
I mean, it seems pointless.

27:44.133 --> 27:45.499
Does it?

27:45.799 --> 27:47.110
I mean, there has to be some reason

27:47.110 --> 27:48.932
why you were standing in the picture, holding a knife.

27:48.932 --> 27:50.011
I didn't have a knife.

27:50.011 --> 27:52.554
Why did you go to the square in the first place?

27:53.997 --> 27:55.571
I wanted to talk to Damon,

27:55.571 --> 27:57.350
See if I could get some answers.

27:57.417 --> 27:59.484
Maybe he would tell me where Shane was.

27:59.551 --> 28:02.484
Not that he would tell me that Shane was at the bottom of a lake.

28:02.551 --> 28:04.317
So you think that Damon killed Shane

28:04.384 --> 28:07.257
to hide the fact that it's not his novel?

28:08.661 --> 28:11.250
You're the one that said that Shane was angry.

28:12.021 --> 28:13.727
Maybe that's why.

28:17.645 --> 28:19.303
- Now, why doesn't this kid, uh...  - Colin.

28:19.303 --> 28:21.463
Why doesn't Colin bust Damon for plagiarism?

28:21.463 --> 28:24.568
Um, because he can't prove it. Shane took all of his artwork.

28:24.568 --> 28:27.770
And sold it to Damon, who is claiming it as his own. That is low.

28:27.770 --> 28:30.513
I mean, but would Damon Weaver really kill this kid to protect his secret?

28:30.513 --> 28:32.001
I don't know. Maybe it was an accident,

28:32.001 --> 28:34.171
Or maybe he realized that he was in a position

28:34.171 --> 28:35.217
where he could lose everything.

28:35.284 --> 28:36.217
Everything, huh?

28:36.284 --> 28:37.584
Yeah. His reputation, his career.

28:37.651 --> 28:40.760
Hey, why doesn't the ghost force Damon to draw a confession?

28:40.760 --> 28:42.080
Maybe that's what he has in mind.

28:42.080 --> 28:43.814
I mean, it's all pretty public.

28:43.814 --> 28:45.479
You know, maybe he's trying to torment Damon

28:45.479 --> 28:46.738
so that he'll confess what he did.

28:46.738 --> 28:48.574
And will that be plagiarism or murder?

28:48.574 --> 28:49.889
Maybe both.

30:16.890 --> 30:18.284
Ok, Shane.

30:18.350 --> 30:19.815
Maybe you're right.

30:45.175 --> 30:47.663
Almost makes the interest rate increase worth it.

30:48.009 --> 30:49.769
Do you people break and enter often?

30:49.938 --> 30:51.809
Uh, it's not considered breaking and entering

30:51.908 --> 30:54.874
unless we people get caught, so you wanna close the door?

30:59.608 --> 31:02.315
Well, you're the graphic novelist.

31:02.315 --> 31:04.045
Go sniff out the kid's artwork.

31:04.045 --> 31:05.148
What if Damon comes back?

31:05.148 --> 31:07.552
Melinda's got the perfect vantage point from her shop.

31:07.552 --> 31:10.308
She'll give us a heads-up if she sees him.

31:10.375 --> 31:11.542
How 'bout the ghost?

31:11.608 --> 31:13.608
Oh, him.

31:13.675 --> 31:16.107
I really won't know he's here until I hear him.

31:16.107 --> 31:18.208
So he could possess one of us like he did to Damon?

31:18.275 --> 31:20.041
Yep.

31:30.775 --> 31:33.475
Oh, no. I think I upset him.

31:33.542 --> 31:37.320
Shane, we're here because we wanna help.

31:40.229 --> 31:41.702
I don't think he cares.

31:42.608 --> 31:45.380
We know you took your stepbrother's artwork.

31:45.380 --> 31:47.197
Did you really sell it to Damon?

31:47.709 --> 31:50.041
It's time to set things right, Shane.

31:50.108 --> 31:51.608
Just talk to me.

31:54.175 --> 31:55.108
Ok.

31:55.175 --> 31:56.974
We can show ourselves out.

31:58.842 --> 32:00.248
What is that?

32:04.427 --> 32:06.155
I think he's gone.

32:14.433 --> 32:16.188
Do you know how much these are worth?

32:16.188 --> 32:17.709
These are signed by Frank Miller.

32:17.775 --> 32:19.342
They're originals.

32:20.351 --> 32:23.156
Yeah, well, guess what other originals Damon has,

32:23.156 --> 32:24.941
Colin's.

32:25.008 --> 32:27.930
These are really good. The kid's got talent.

32:30.718 --> 32:33.274
Melinda. Is Damon on the move?

32:33.274 --> 32:34.584
Are we about to be made?

32:34.584 --> 32:36.195
No, he's at the book signing.

32:37.957 --> 32:39.434
Did you find anything?

32:39.434 --> 32:42.575
Well, we found Colin's artwork.

32:43.939 --> 32:45.894
And a copy of Damon's new book.

32:45.894 --> 32:49.583
Now we'll see if Damon really did rip it off.

32:52.610 --> 32:55.691
There are differences in Damon's background art and details,

32:55.691 --> 32:58.770
But the story, the content, it's the same as Colin's.

32:58.770 --> 33:01.608
Yeah. Colin said that the material was personal. He's right.

33:01.846 --> 33:03.832
So this character, the one who's losing his powers,

33:03.832 --> 33:04.858
That's supposed to be Shane?

33:04.858 --> 33:06.058
Well, I mean, it seems to fit.

33:06.058 --> 33:08.511
The character in the story is abandoned by his mom

33:08.511 --> 33:10.095
because his powers make her sick.

33:10.095 --> 33:12.860
Right. The absentee mom who dropped out of Shane's life.

33:12.860 --> 33:14.730
Custody issues can do a number on kids.

33:14.730 --> 33:16.508
That's probably what made Shane act out

33:16.575 --> 33:18.197
and cause trouble for his dad and stepmom.

33:18.197 --> 33:20.785
So I guess when the ghost said that Damon took his life,

33:20.785 --> 33:23.488
He meant this story, his story.

33:23.488 --> 33:25.376
Well, check this out.

33:25.793 --> 33:27.969
That obviously is colin,

33:27.969 --> 33:30.603
And he's got Shane hooked up to these weird tubes and wires,

33:30.603 --> 33:32.411
like maybe he's torturing him.

33:32.977 --> 33:34.866
No wonder the ghost was so angry.

33:34.866 --> 33:37.874
His stepbrother was getting his kicks off Shane's personal pain.

33:38.908 --> 33:40.908
Then why isn't Shane haunting Colin?

33:40.974 --> 33:42.837
I think that the ghost is using the drawings

33:42.837 --> 33:45.908
to get Colin to go after Damon, like they did with the knife.

33:45.974 --> 33:48.308
You know, trying to get the stepbrother to do something stupid.

33:48.375 --> 33:50.371
But that knife attack didn't happen.

33:50.371 --> 33:51.975
Not yet.

33:52.654 --> 33:53.269
What's wrong?

33:53.269 --> 33:55.857
A lot if we don't get to that book signing.

33:56.958 --> 33:59.112
Well, I guess I'll hold down the fort.

34:06.137 --> 34:07.587
Oh, no.

34:14.041 --> 34:16.083
Would you make this one out to "my biggest fan"?

34:16.083 --> 34:17.956
Zach. That's short for Zachary.

34:20.804 --> 34:21.880
How many would you like?

34:22.833 --> 34:25.054
- Just one.  - That'll be 4.95.

34:25.570 --> 34:28.375
You should be signing those books, Colin,

34:28.442 --> 34:30.841
not him.

34:30.908 --> 34:33.275
Here's your change.

34:33.342 --> 34:35.475
Thank you.

34:35.542 --> 34:36.929
I love the explosion.

34:36.929 --> 34:39.775
The genesis of the hero's powers is so, uh...

34:39.841 --> 34:41.208
What was your inspiration?

34:41.275 --> 34:42.695
The words you create are so intense.

34:42.695 --> 34:45.074
I never know if your characters are going to live or die.

34:45.141 --> 34:46.685
Uh, who...who should I make it out to?

34:46.685 --> 34:47.940
"my coolest fan, Monique."

34:48.007 --> 34:49.641
"to my coolest fan, Monique."

34:52.266 --> 34:53.900
Thank you, Mr. Weaver.

34:56.108 --> 34:57.874
Look, I need to take a break.

34:57.941 --> 34:59.245
We've got a line of people waiting.

34:59.245 --> 35:00.781
Yes. I gotta get out of here.

35:00.781 --> 35:02.075
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

35:03.475 --> 35:05.675
Colin! No!

35:18.400 --> 35:20.899
How could you do this?

35:20.966 --> 35:22.655
I can't believe I looked up to you for years.

35:22.655 --> 35:24.166
Get this kid out of here.

35:24.954 --> 35:27.491
Hey, drop the knife, drop it!

35:28.715 --> 35:30.667
Let's go.

35:37.018 --> 35:37.934
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

35:37.934 --> 35:40.022
Hold on. Let him go.

35:40.022 --> 35:41.474
Are you nuts? He came at you with a knife.

35:41.474 --> 35:45.068
Just please let him go. He had every right.

35:49.600 --> 35:52.467
Uh, I'm sorry, everybody.

35:53.300 --> 35:55.133
I'm so sorry. Uh...

35:57.832 --> 35:59.366
There's something I gotta say.

36:05.400 --> 36:08.632
I can't believe Damon admitted that he ripped off my work.

36:08.699 --> 36:10.933
You didn't really give him any choice.

36:12.199 --> 36:13.699
Shane's here, isn't he?

36:13.766 --> 36:15.033
Yes.

36:16.999 --> 36:20.233
I didn't...I didn't feel him near me,

36:20.300 --> 36:21.766
not until a few days ago.

36:21.832 --> 36:23.599
Before that, the house just felt

36:23.666 --> 36:26.278
as cold and as empty as when he left.

36:26.999 --> 36:30.499
It felt cold and empty to me way before that.

36:31.565 --> 36:34.400
He felt that way, too, when he was alive.

36:34.465 --> 36:37.866
And Colin, he was always in his room,

36:37.933 --> 36:41.133
his head down, drawing away.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.300
Shane felt really alone,

36:43.366 --> 36:48.300
and he envied you for being able to tune it all out.

36:49.832 --> 36:51.133
It pissed me off,

36:51.199 --> 36:53.565
but thanks for putting it nicely.

36:53.632 --> 36:56.066
And that's when you took Colin's drawings.

36:56.133 --> 36:57.599
Was it to hurt me?

36:57.666 --> 37:02.033
Because all you ever did was make fun of them, of me.

37:02.099 --> 37:04.400
I didn't really know what you were doing,

37:04.465 --> 37:06.233
not the whole story.

37:06.300 --> 37:08.532
When my dad kicked me out, I was looking for cash.

37:08.599 --> 37:11.133
I was going through everybody's drawers,

37:11.199 --> 37:14.400
and when I saw what Colin was working on...

37:16.333 --> 37:18.899
He wasn't as oblivious as I thought.

37:19.766 --> 37:20.899
What do you mean?

37:20.966 --> 37:22.933
The story, it was about this kid

37:22.999 --> 37:24.532
whose house gets blown up,

37:24.599 --> 37:27.699
and when he wakes up, he gets these powers.

37:27.766 --> 37:30.599
He can disappear. He can destroy stuff.

37:35.465 --> 37:37.565
Except his mom,

37:37.632 --> 37:42.199
turns out she's allergic to his new chemistry or whatever...

37:45.199 --> 37:48.066
So she has to go away from him.

37:50.300 --> 37:52.699
You said Damon took your life.

37:54.565 --> 37:56.799
You meant what Colin wrote about you.

37:56.866 --> 37:58.699
That was your life story.

37:59.699 --> 38:01.266
After the divorce...

38:02.933 --> 38:04.999
My mom didn't want me.

38:06.099 --> 38:08.699
My dad said it was this big custody battle,

38:08.699 --> 38:11.799
But I heard him talking to Colin's mom one night,

38:11.866 --> 38:16.266
Saying how she had said that leaving was her chance to be free.

38:18.233 --> 38:20.465
Free of me.

38:21.699 --> 38:24.066
Shane read your story,

38:24.133 --> 38:25.899
the part about the mom.

38:26.738 --> 38:28.438
Was he mad?

38:28.438 --> 38:30.999
I mean, those drawings are just for me.

38:31.066 --> 38:33.866
Tell him it's ok. It's ok.

38:35.366 --> 38:40.006
When I saw them, I finally felt less alone,

38:40.386 --> 38:42.333
Like he got it.

38:42.400 --> 38:45.366
But by then, I had done so many crappy things,

38:45.432 --> 38:47.432
I basically got myself kicked out.

38:49.266 --> 38:53.699
I thought at least I could do one good thing...

38:55.366 --> 38:56.565
for colin.

38:59.300 --> 39:01.866
And that's when you brought Damon his drawings.

39:01.933 --> 39:04.166
I just wanted him to see them.

39:04.233 --> 39:05.899
He was Colin's hero.

39:05.966 --> 39:08.666
And Colin's so talented.

39:08.732 --> 39:11.999
I figured why wouldn't he want to help him?

39:13.465 --> 39:15.966
And Damon wouldn't even look at 'em.

39:17.333 --> 39:18.565
But I left the drawings.

39:18.632 --> 39:21.799
When I left, I took a shortcut across the lake.

39:27.166 --> 39:29.099
It was a stupid mistake,

39:29.166 --> 39:31.333
like so many I had made.

39:47.166 --> 39:50.366
Shane died taking a shortcut from your house.

39:51.899 --> 39:53.400
I didn't know.

39:53.465 --> 39:54.666
I swear.

39:54.732 --> 39:57.166
He said that he tried to show you Colin's drawings,

39:57.233 --> 39:58.166
but you weren't interested.

39:58.233 --> 40:00.199
I wasn't. I never even glanced at it

40:00.266 --> 40:03.922
Until my publisher came to my house and saw it next to my desk.

40:03.922 --> 40:05.832
She thought the stuff was fantastic.

40:05.899 --> 40:07.966
I was so stuck.

40:08.033 --> 40:10.866
I was so over.

40:10.933 --> 40:13.465
I just needed to dig out,

40:13.532 --> 40:15.933
so I redrew it all as my own.

40:15.999 --> 40:18.266
But if Shane could make you draw,

40:18.333 --> 40:21.133
then he could have made you confess.

40:22.266 --> 40:23.699
I mean, he could have stopped you.

40:23.766 --> 40:25.266
So why didn't he?

40:25.333 --> 40:27.499
Why'd he make me do it?

40:27.565 --> 40:29.799
I thought the least Damon could do

40:29.866 --> 40:32.420
after what he did was get your work published.

40:32.792 --> 40:34.732
Everyone's gonna know your name.

40:34.799 --> 40:38.732
They're gonna care who you are,

40:38.799 --> 40:40.699
and you'll never feel alone.

40:41.899 --> 40:44.499
He really wanted your novel to be published.

40:45.688 --> 40:48.999
Maybe if people could see how special you were,

40:49.066 --> 40:52.766
then you would never feel alone the way that he did.

40:53.699 --> 40:55.066
I'm gonna make sure of that.

40:55.133 --> 40:57.866
Look, if it's ok with you, I'd like to help.

40:57.933 --> 40:59.799
Publishing gets pretty brutal sometimes,

40:59.866 --> 41:03.366
and you're already having a pretty strange launch.

41:04.199 --> 41:06.133
It's the least I could do,

41:06.199 --> 41:07.532
if you'll let me.

41:09.400 --> 41:12.066
Tell Colin I think he should trust this guy.

41:12.133 --> 41:16.432
We all deserve the chance to clean up our mistakes.

41:20.832 --> 41:22.066
And besides...

41:23.565 --> 41:25.465
I may not be around to look out for him.

41:25.532 --> 41:27.300
You see the light, don't you?

41:27.366 --> 41:29.666
It's so beautiful.

41:30.933 --> 41:33.266
You can't even believe it's real.

41:34.233 --> 41:35.499
He's ready.

41:35.565 --> 41:38.066
The light?

41:38.133 --> 41:39.666
What's it look like?

41:40.796 --> 41:44.623
Even you, you couldn't draw it.

41:55.432 --> 41:57.999
He said even you couldn't draw it.

42:06.066 --> 42:08.799
Come on, slowpoke, or you're gonna be late for class.

42:08.866 --> 42:10.799
Hey, I thought you finished your school project last night.

42:10.866 --> 42:11.966
This isn't for school.

42:12.033 --> 42:13.166
It's just for fun.

42:13.233 --> 42:14.766
Ok, well, that's Shane,

42:14.832 --> 42:17.300
and that's his sidekick Colin. Not bad.

42:17.366 --> 42:20.866
No, mommy. This is me, and that's my brother.

42:21.799 --> 42:23.666
Uh, what brother is that, sport?

42:23.732 --> 42:25.532
Well, he's just made up.

42:26.499 --> 42:28.933
Like my teacher says, a fig of my imagination.

42:30.075 --> 42:31.101
Exactly.

42:31.750 --> 42:33.427
It would be cool to have a brother.

42:33.427 --> 42:35.620
He might be different, like me.

42:36.182 --> 42:37.826
Well, do you feel that different?

42:38.070 --> 42:40.854
I'm different from everyone, even you, mom.

42:42.097 --> 42:43.060
Yeah, but, you know,

42:43.060 --> 42:45.467
there's more things that make us the same than different.

42:46.003 --> 42:46.975
Like what?

42:46.975 --> 42:49.997
Like what we feel.

42:50.739 --> 42:51.911
What do you feel?

42:51.911 --> 42:55.005
Right now, nothing but love.

42:56.333 --> 42:57.266
Come here.

42:57.333 --> 42:58.799
Oh, my baby.

42:58.866 --> 43:00.899
I'll second that one.

43:01.699 --> 43:03.266
Guys, you're squishing me.

43:04.321 --> 43:06.500
All right. Let's go to school.

43:08.732 --> 43:10.899
- Get your backpack, sport.  - Ok.
