02:25.343 --> 02:27.412
What the hell, Dad?

02:27.446 --> 02:31.584
Time to wake up!
Come on, the WBL waits for no man!

02:31.616 --> 02:33.752
You want it? You gotta earn it!

02:33.786 --> 02:35.788
It's 6 in the morning.

02:35.821 --> 02:40.026
Yes, that means it's
training time. Come on.

02:40.059 --> 02:41.960
Richie, come on.

02:43.561 --> 02:45.797
Playing professional
basketball used to be my dream

02:45.830 --> 02:47.799
and now that dream is dead.

02:47.833 --> 02:51.503
Dead. So now it's your dream and

02:51.537 --> 02:55.041
I'm gonna be there every step of
the way helping you realize it,

02:55.073 --> 02:56.642
ok? Alright.

02:56.674 --> 02:58.610
Gee. Thanks, Dad.

02:58.644 --> 03:02.381
You're welcome son. Now get
your bony ass up out of bed and

03:02.413 --> 03:05.884
meet me on the
driveway in 5 minutes.

03:05.918 --> 03:07.453
Alright, there!

03:07.485 --> 03:09.054
Now
meet me out there in 5 minutes

03:09.087 --> 03:11.357
or I'm gonna fold this thing and
I'm gonna make a Richie sandwich

03:11.389 --> 03:12.657
out of you. 5 minutes, let's go!

03:28.706 --> 03:30.575
Morning.

03:31.175 --> 03:32.544
Aren't these the guys that

03:32.578 --> 03:34.580
you hired at
Home Depot last week?

03:34.613 --> 03:35.580
Yeah, they are.

03:35.614 --> 03:36.849
Aren't they finished?

03:36.882 --> 03:39.418
No. They're not finished because
they've got one more job to do

03:39.450 --> 03:42.520
which if they do correctly,
they'll get a little extra

03:42.554 --> 03:44.991
scratch because it's
Christmas and I gotta heart.

03:45.424 --> 03:47.126
It's Christmas?

03:50.895 --> 03:52.898
Awe, you're doing great, son!

03:53.431 --> 03:56.468
For them it's Christmas.
It's not Christmas for you until

03:56.501 --> 03:58.403
you run the carwash drill.

03:58.436 --> 04:00.805
There's a whole
house of presents inside, Rich.

04:00.839 --> 04:02.608
There's a
skateboard. There's a...

04:02.640 --> 04:05.678
There's some clothes. All
kinds of cool stuff and I will

04:05.710 --> 04:07.145
burn them on this god damned

04:07.179 --> 04:09.982
driveway
unless you score in this drill.

04:10.014 --> 04:11.116
Merry Christmas, Richie.

04:11.150 --> 04:12.285
Shut up!

04:12.317 --> 04:15.487
Alright, Bring it. Let's go.
Christmas is for winners!

04:16.487 --> 04:17.755
Now let's go!

04:30.602 --> 04:34.774
What? You gonna cry?
You gonna cry and be

04:34.806 --> 04:38.544
a little cry baby and you gonna
quit? Wanna call mommy? Well you

04:38.576 --> 04:40.779
can call her but she won't pick
up the phone because she left us

04:40.813 --> 04:42.715
both to go be a sister wife!

04:42.748 --> 04:45.818
What? You can't be both.

04:45.850 --> 04:49.087
Now get up and do it again.
And hey,

04:49.121 --> 04:51.056
this comes from a place of love.

04:51.088 --> 04:53.692
If I didn't love you, you
wouldn't have the helmet.

04:54.492 --> 04:56.161
Now do it again.

04:56.195 --> 04:59.765
You want to be a winner or do
you want to be a loser, Rich?

04:59.797 --> 05:01.065
Huh?

05:01.099 --> 05:03.436
Winner or loser?

05:03.469 --> 05:06.705
Rich is gonna be a winner.
Now let's go.

05:23.955 --> 05:26.692
Royals down by one.
Seven seconds left.

05:26.725 --> 05:30.061
This is where legends are made
and dreams are crushed.

05:30.095 --> 05:32.097
The fans couldn't have
asked for a more exciting

05:32.129 --> 05:35.900
start to the WBL Finals. Rich
Johnson, he promised to

05:35.934 --> 05:38.136
bring a championship to
Sacramento after a 40-year

05:38.169 --> 05:41.806
drought and a win here would put
them one step closer!

05:41.840 --> 05:46.078
Stivers is wide open!
God, Jerry, what a hog!

05:46.111 --> 05:48.948
He is not gonna pass the ball.
Rich is going one on one.

05:48.980 --> 05:52.617
Strictly isoball and throwing
up trash in here for the win.

05:53.818 --> 05:57.823
Wow! Unbelievable.
If you don't like that,

05:57.855 --> 06:00.258
you don't
like Royals basketball.

06:00.292 --> 06:02.227
I love Royals basketball!

06:06.263 --> 06:08.501
Joe Riley live here.
The game has just ended.

06:08.534 --> 06:11.170
It's very exciting. We're trying
to reach one of the Rich! Rich.

06:11.203 --> 06:16.107
Freddie, Fred, Fred we did it, man.
We did it, Fred!

06:16.140 --> 06:18.744
Uh, Joe.

06:18.777 --> 06:22.114
Sorry, Joe. Wait,
when did you change that?

06:22.147 --> 06:23.048
At birth.

06:23.082 --> 06:26.619
Hey man, I've just gotta
say look, I mean.

06:26.652 --> 06:30.823
I gotta thank the big man
himself. I want to thank me.

06:32.991 --> 06:35.928
That looked like an impossible
shot at the end there.

06:35.960 --> 06:38.129
Freddie, I'm kidding. Joe, um,

06:38.162 --> 06:41.799
look, my shot was just dropping
tonight. What can I say?

06:41.833 --> 06:42.967
It was falling.

06:43.001 --> 06:45.738
You're
kidding? You shot 28%.

06:45.770 --> 06:47.840
Yeah well you
know I was double and I was

06:47.873 --> 06:49.808
triple teamed but you know,

06:49.840 --> 06:53.311
look, the ball just does what
Rich Johnson tells it to do.

06:53.345 --> 06:57.583
Boom! I would love to stay and
chat, but my fan club awaits.

06:57.616 --> 06:59.519
Rich Johnson! Out!

07:01.652 --> 07:02.920
Rich Johnson's out.

07:02.955 --> 07:06.025
Hey, Rich! Hey, Rich!
Can I have your Jersey please?

07:06.058 --> 07:09.762
What, this one? Oh, you know
what? It's going on sale on eBay

07:09.794 --> 07:11.563
tonight at around midnight.

07:11.597 --> 07:12.765
I hope you can stay up.

07:21.039 --> 07:23.075
Yeah, ah ha.

07:23.107 --> 07:26.244
Boom, my man. Yes!

07:26.277 --> 07:29.982
There we go.
Up high. Yeah. Coach, yeah,

07:30.015 --> 07:31.917

07:31.950 --> 07:36.222
yeah, yeah, yeah. My man. Oh,
that's cold. What's up, bro?

07:36.722 --> 07:39.657
Yeah. Oh, it's
gonna be a good one!

07:41.092 --> 07:42.261
Oh!

07:42.294 --> 07:45.330
Oh, come on. I barely touched
him. I barely touched him.

07:45.830 --> 07:50.001
Yeah.
He'll be fine. Oh yeah, fellas.

07:50.035 --> 07:51.270
This is what I'm talking about.

07:51.302 --> 07:55.340
Boom,
two, three championship rings.

07:55.374 --> 07:59.244
Oh my hand is so heavy. Oh, it's
throwing my back out. Oh, yeah.

07:59.277 --> 08:01.981
You know rookie. You've gotta
play at least one minute if you

08:02.013 --> 08:04.917
want to get one of
these. Nah, I'm just playing.

08:04.950 --> 08:07.720
I'm just playing. No, you get
one but it says equipment

08:07.753 --> 08:11.789
manager on it. I'm playing
with you rook, come on, relax.

08:12.924 --> 08:16.962
Oh, come on. Whooh!

08:16.994 --> 08:19.131
Oh man. Hey,
you know what? Guys listen up.

08:19.164 --> 08:21.133
Give me this. Guys, listen up.

08:21.532 --> 08:25.037
Look, we are three wins away

08:25.070 --> 08:28.707
from the WBL Championship, ok?

08:28.739 --> 08:32.076
And I did not get traded
here to Sac town to lose.

08:32.109 --> 08:36.181
Now, now, listen here.
If I have to, I will put all you

08:36.214 --> 08:40.219
on my back and I will personally
carry you all across the finish

08:40.251 --> 08:44.957
line, alright? It's been
a dream of my dad's

08:44.989 --> 08:46.725
It's been a dream of

08:46.758 --> 08:50.128
mine to bring a
championship here to Sac Town.

08:50.628 --> 08:55.133
So all you gotta do is trust in
Rich and then just come to the

08:55.167 --> 08:58.870
Championship
parade. Rich Johnson out!

08:58.903 --> 08:59.904
I'm not sure that door

08:59.939 --> 09:01.907
is big enough for
his ego to fit through, man.

09:04.176 --> 09:06.211
No, no, no, no, no,
sorry. Gotta go, gotta go.

09:11.048 --> 09:13.785
I really hate that guy.

09:22.960 --> 09:27.231
Good morning. Good morning.

09:27.264 --> 09:28.800
What's this? I
ordered Eggs Benedict.

09:28.834 --> 09:30.335
Eat your cereal, Earl.

09:30.368 --> 09:33.138
This cereal
tastes like a fruity

09:33.171 --> 09:36.075
Oh, yeah.
Fastest hands in the WBL.

09:36.108 --> 09:37.810
That's your
first steal of the year.

09:37.843 --> 09:40.713
Hey, how to I hear the replay
from my game winning shot?

09:41.312 --> 09:43.114
Why don't you use
my new gift that I gave ya?

09:43.148 --> 09:44.115
Ooh, right here.

09:44.148 --> 09:45.717
Are you ok?

09:45.750 --> 09:49.688
Yeah. No, I'm
fine. I'm uh, I'm fine. Ok, uh

09:50.388 --> 09:54.393
Alicia, play some
Rich Johnson highlights.

09:54.426 --> 09:57.296
Johnson. A slang term commonly

09:57.329 --> 09:59.798
used for the word 'penis'.

09:59.830 --> 10:04.235
Other terms include dick,
schlong, wang, dong, shvantz

10:05.003 --> 10:08.107
Ok, honey. I think you have
a few minutes before school

10:08.139 --> 10:10.475
starts to show daddy those
costumes. Remember, you're going

10:10.508 --> 10:13.912
to model her costume
that she made just for you.

10:14.412 --> 10:17.349
Oh yeah. The uh, nerd fest.

10:18.383 --> 10:20.285
CostumeCon, Daddy.

10:20.317 --> 10:24.455
It's my bad, sorry. Yeah I
guess it kind of looks like me.

10:24.489 --> 10:26.292
It could be a little bigger.

10:28.292 --> 10:30.328
Looks great, honey. It's
just like me. Good job.

10:31.128 --> 10:34.032
You fight crime by
being the best athlete in the

10:34.065 --> 10:36.768
universe. You throw
basketballs at super villains.

10:36.801 --> 10:38.870
And the villains never know when
he's gonna throw balls at them.

10:38.903 --> 10:40.939
Just like his
teammates in real life.

10:41.540 --> 10:44.977
Funny mommy. Funny mommy.

10:46.378 --> 10:50.014
Ok, go. You're
gonna make her late.

10:50.047 --> 10:51.350
Oh and don't forget you're

10:51.383 --> 10:54.051
gonna coach
Jenny's game at 5:30.

10:54.085 --> 10:57.122
Oh yeah, of course. But
first I've gotta take the jet.

10:57.154 --> 10:59.858
I've gotta go
see the Dr. in San Francisco.

11:00.359 --> 11:02.494
But I'm gonna remember.
I'm gonna be there.

11:02.527 --> 11:03.561
Don't
worry. I said I'd be there.

11:03.595 --> 11:04.562
I'm gonna be there too.

11:04.595 --> 11:05.596
No,
you're not because you're

11:05.630 --> 11:07.965
already suspended
for the rest of the season.

11:07.999 --> 11:10.469
Really? You think that's gonna
keep me out of there? Please.

11:10.502 --> 11:11.737
Cause you've got a plan.

11:11.769 --> 11:15.540
I've got a plan and my plan is
to get uh, nope, you've gotta

11:15.574 --> 11:16.976
get me Eggs Benedict.

11:17.343 --> 11:21.479
Oh, double
or nothing, bacon. Oh! Nice.

11:33.490 --> 11:36.360
Alright, thank you.

11:36.393 --> 11:38.129
Here
we go, grandma. Come on.

11:38.162 --> 11:39.565
Rich, what're you doing here?

11:39.598 --> 11:41.066
I'm just helping with grandma.

11:41.099 --> 11:43.368
She needs new
glasses for her glaucoma.

11:43.401 --> 11:45.370
We're huge Royals fans.

11:45.402 --> 11:48.574
Your grandson is going to lead
us to the first WBL Championship

11:48.606 --> 11:50.975
in over 40 years.
You must be so proud.

11:51.676 --> 11:55.080
Dude, she is such a GILF.

11:55.113 --> 11:56.614
What the hell is that?

11:56.648 --> 11:59.417
It's like a
MILF but for grandmas.

11:59.450 --> 12:00.619
Do you think she's single?

12:00.652 --> 12:03.021
Yeah I think she's single
because all of her options are

12:03.053 --> 12:04.455
either dead or
can't get it up anymore.

12:04.489 --> 12:05.690
What the hell is wrong with you?

12:05.724 --> 12:08.093
Hey, people have done a lot
worse things to become famous,

12:08.125 --> 12:12.263
alright? Hey baby, if you were
on Tinder I'd slide right...

12:12.297 --> 12:14.499
into your panties.

12:14.532 --> 12:16.200
Nice.

12:16.234 --> 12:17.268
Diapers?

12:17.301 --> 12:18.637
She's out of your league Q-tip.

12:18.670 --> 12:20.139
You lost.

12:57.642 --> 13:02.982
Um, what if we tried
that from a different angle?

13:03.949 --> 13:07.353
We did. I don't know
what to tell you Mr. Johnson.

13:08.286 --> 13:10.255
How about the bottom line?

13:10.287 --> 13:13.991
Ok well, the bottom line is, I'm
the fifth doctor you've seen and

13:14.024 --> 13:15.894
we all share the same diagnosis.

13:16.527 --> 13:18.229
Your days of playing on that

13:18.263 --> 13:20.431
knee are coming to an end.

13:22.466 --> 13:27.472
Rich, Father Time is
undefeated for a reason.

13:35.180 --> 13:38.250
Hey Rich, my
son gave me that.

13:47.292 --> 13:49.161
These
doctors don't know shit.

13:49.194 --> 13:53.399
Screw you. Screw you,
father time. Screw you.

13:54.032 --> 13:57.035
If Tom Brady can do
it then so can I.

13:57.067 --> 13:59.304
Shit! Shit! Shit!

14:02.440 --> 14:05.377
Sorry,
was I just thinking out loud?

14:05.409 --> 14:08.279
Jesus Christ!
You scream like a bitch!

14:08.846 --> 14:11.515
Hey, thanks
a lot for coming today.

14:11.548 --> 14:15.553
Here's the 50 bucks I
told you I'd give you plus an

14:15.586 --> 14:18.189
extra 10 cause you had to
hear all those naughty words.

14:18.790 --> 14:21.159
Do I get to keep the glasses?

14:21.191 --> 14:22.159
Yeah. They
look good on you.

14:22.192 --> 14:23.360
Bullshit.

14:23.393 --> 14:25.763
I'm gonna turn them in for
the bottle deposit before the

14:25.797 --> 14:28.399
sun hits them and lights
my freaking' face on fire.

14:28.432 --> 14:30.501
Just remember,
you can't tell anyone what you

14:30.534 --> 14:32.203
just heard.
That's part of the deal.

14:33.138 --> 14:34.339
500 bucks.

14:34.372 --> 14:35.573
What?

14:35.606 --> 14:39.710
You heard me. Five Benjamins
or I tell everybody the doc said

14:39.744 --> 14:41.580
you shouldn't
be playing anymore.

14:42.113 --> 14:44.049
On
second thought, maybe I should

14:44.081 --> 14:47.018
say something so Stivers doesn't
get caught under the hoop with

14:47.051 --> 14:48.619
his dick in his hands next time.

14:49.653 --> 14:51.489
You've gotta be kidding me.

14:52.824 --> 14:56.462
Three, four, five, there.

14:57.394 --> 15:00.431
And, I'll take your watch.

15:00.465 --> 15:02.066
No.

15:02.867 --> 15:06.471
What, I gotta buy
you dinner now too?

15:06.503 --> 15:08.340
No, you're not my type.

15:08.373 --> 15:12.277
Hey Captain. Can this
thing drop me at a Red Lobster?

15:26.791 --> 15:29.661
Alright guys.
Just chill out. Just relax.

15:29.694 --> 15:31.363
I know you guys...

15:31.696 --> 15:36.368
I know you guys know me as like
a globally famous athlete.

15:36.401 --> 15:38.770
Ok,
you've seen the commercials.

15:38.802 --> 15:40.806
You've seen the
sponsorship deals you know.

15:40.839 --> 15:45.411
Guys look guys,
chill out. Ok? I'm just a man.

15:46.043 --> 15:49.614
I'm just a man, a man who

15:49.647 --> 15:53.786
loves winning. Yeah, winning!

15:54.219 --> 15:56.321
That's what I'm talking about.
What are we doing here?

15:56.354 --> 15:58.556
What is this
like mascara here? Alright?

15:58.590 --> 16:02.259
No, no mascara alright? The
only black I want to see under

16:02.292 --> 16:04.830
your eyes is if you're taking a
charge. Sit down. Stop, hey,

16:04.863 --> 16:08.333
hello. Hello, hi, yeah, hi.

16:08.365 --> 16:11.702
We're having a little coaching
session here, ok? Yeah.

16:13.403 --> 16:15.706
Your
parents telling you to just go

16:15.739 --> 16:16.674
have fun out there?

16:16.707 --> 16:19.677
They're losers. Your
parents are all losers.

16:19.710 --> 16:20.711
Dad?

16:20.744 --> 16:22.346
You're calling yourself a loser.

16:22.379 --> 16:24.448
Uh, no. Not
me. I mean them. All of them.

16:24.481 --> 16:28.385
All of your parents, not her
parent. Your parents are losers.

16:28.418 --> 16:32.456
Her parent is cool.
Her parent loves to win.

16:32.489 --> 16:35.326
Look, this is not about
having a good time.

16:35.359 --> 16:37.428
This is about what, girls, what?

16:37.461 --> 16:42.266
Wuuuh, wuhhhh, winning!

16:42.633 --> 16:43.734
Winning!

16:43.768 --> 16:46.738
That is the single most
important thing that we're going

16:46.771 --> 16:51.376
to do when we go out there is
win! Win! It's all about

16:51.408 --> 16:55.813
winning. Ok? Everything. The
most important thing in the

16:55.846 --> 17:00.151
world. Not friends, not family,
not the environment, not this

17:00.185 --> 17:02.487
plastic problem that we're
having. It has nothing to do

17:02.519 --> 17:03.854
with that. It is about winning.

17:03.888 --> 17:06.457
That is the
best feeling in the world.

17:06.957 --> 17:09.160
Now come on little ducklings.
In the middle.

17:09.194 --> 17:10.529
On three, little
ducklings. One, two, three.

17:10.560 --> 17:11.862
Lil Ducklings!

17:16.599 --> 17:18.536
Alright, girls. Hustle it up.

17:18.569 --> 17:21.373
That's it,
come on. Get those re's, girls.

17:21.406 --> 17:24.675
Get out of here,
come on. Alright, girls!

17:24.708 --> 17:26.443
Oh shit! You're Rich Johnson.

17:26.476 --> 17:27.778
Oh my God, hey,
sign my buns.

17:27.810 --> 17:29.814
No, I'm not. Get out
of here, weenie boy. Move it.

17:34.519 --> 17:35.620
Ok.

17:35.653 --> 17:36.788
Just really quick man.

17:36.821 --> 17:39.657
Ok, alright. Ok,
now go. Come on.

17:39.690 --> 17:40.691
Let's go girls!

17:40.725 --> 17:43.962
Sorry. Yeah, let's
go girls! Come on. Let's go!

17:43.994 --> 17:45.496
Ok, thank you. Thank you.

17:45.530 --> 17:46.565
If
you need help I'm right here.

17:46.598 --> 17:47.765
Thank you. Thank you.

17:47.799 --> 17:49.367
Hey, I got coupons.

17:49.399 --> 17:52.436
I'm okay right now, maybe later.
Alright girls. Girls.

17:55.974 --> 17:58.643
Shoot! You're a Johnson!

17:58.676 --> 17:59.677
Shut up!

17:59.878 --> 18:00.878
Shoot!

18:03.247 --> 18:04.582
No point.

18:06.484 --> 18:08.853
You're a ball
hog, just like your dad!

18:10.554 --> 18:14.625
Oh!
Foul! That's a foul.

18:14.658 --> 18:17.829
I've seen people get pregnant
with less contact than that.

18:21.832 --> 18:24.302
Trip, she's
trippin' balls ref, come on!

18:24.802 --> 18:27.304
Hey, you people should
appreciate me. Any asshole could

18:27.338 --> 18:30.242
yell at a little girl, but it
takes a funny one to say that

18:30.274 --> 18:31.442
kind of stuff.

18:31.475 --> 18:32.877
I know it's you, Earl.

18:32.909 --> 18:35.513
You can't see shit.
Why don't you bend over

18:35.545 --> 18:38.816
and call the game with your
good eye! That's his butt hole

18:39.951 --> 18:41.586
That's it, get out of here!

18:41.619 --> 18:43.254
You want a piece of me?

18:43.288 --> 18:44.556
Get out of here, Earl!

18:44.589 --> 18:45.756
Out?
It's about time.

18:46.791 --> 18:50.528
You know what, here!

18:50.561 --> 18:55.500
Hey, look at me! I'm playing
soccer. Stupid ass sport!

19:03.808 --> 19:07.613
Let's go girls. Hustle it up.
Get those re's come on!

19:27.898 --> 19:29.667
Girls.

19:35.340 --> 19:36.907
Where did this kid come from?

19:37.574 --> 19:40.946
10 seconds left. We're up by
1. Do not let them get a layup.

19:41.446 --> 19:43.514
This is for you, Dick!

19:46.083 --> 19:48.753
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

19:53.725 --> 19:55.694
Oh my God, I
hope that's ketchup.

20:00.630 --> 20:02.667
Mommy!

20:17.013 --> 20:19.751
It's "Weinergate" folks.
Rich Johnson decimates a

20:19.783 --> 20:22.454
little girl with
one monster rejection.

20:22.486 --> 20:26.757
What a bloody wanker,
Rich Johnson put that banger in a

20:26.791 --> 20:28.059
sticky wicket!

20:28.092 --> 20:31.396
We have to talk about
this weinergate situation.

20:31.428 --> 20:34.398
Rich Johnson just tore
up that poor weiner!

20:34.432 --> 20:37.001
Rich, you just
took it way too far, man.

20:37.033 --> 20:40.972
Rich Johnson from Basketball

20:41.004 --> 20:44.641
is involved in weinergate!
What is wrong with him!

20:44.675 --> 20:48.647
Hurting a little girl is
offensive and wrong!

20:49.446 --> 20:51.148
And the
biggest surprise in all of this?

20:51.182 --> 20:53.885
Johnson was actually for the
first time ever,

20:53.917 --> 20:55.520
playing some defense.

20:55.552 --> 20:58.756
What is going on with
Basketball!? He must go...

21:01.859 --> 21:05.129
The World Basketball League's
Vice President Bill Smegman

21:05.163 --> 21:07.132
has declared a meeting to
determine his fate,

21:07.799 --> 21:09.734
and it
doesn't look good.

21:19.042 --> 21:20.945
Yeah, yeah. You wanna go, huh?

21:20.977 --> 21:22.846
Shouldn't you
be handing out some flyers?

21:22.879 --> 21:25.483
Well, I would but
I'm incapacitated right now.

21:25.515 --> 21:27.718
Yeah, no thanks
to you, you dick head!

21:27.752 --> 21:28.853
Beat it,
weenie breath.

21:28.886 --> 21:30.655
You're weenie breath.

21:32.590 --> 21:34.458
Nice, nice.
Really nice.

21:34.492 --> 21:35.961
Get him, boys!

21:36.860 --> 21:38.696
Oh, ok, great.

21:39.164 --> 21:41.766
Ok, come on. Ooh, yeah.

21:41.799 --> 21:44.802
Oh, come on.
Guys, really.

21:44.836 --> 21:47.639
What are you guys gonna do?

21:47.671 --> 21:52.176
You gonna cheer me
to death? Hey, easy.

21:52.209 --> 21:56.480
Just chill out, ok guys? Just
chill. Take a chill pill.

21:56.513 --> 21:57.514
Stop, chicken!

22:02.419 --> 22:05.556
Oh, you're late.
What a surprise.

22:05.590 --> 22:07.992
Yeah, uh sorry
about that, Shmegs.

22:08.024 --> 22:10.128
I was outside signing autographs

22:10.160 --> 22:11.795
but it's good
to see you, Shmegs.

22:11.829 --> 22:14.999
No, it's Smegman,
Bill Smegman, ok?

22:15.032 --> 22:18.636
I know, Mr. Smegman.
I'm sorry. I was just joking.

22:18.668 --> 22:22.706
You're joking? Yeah well I'm
not. You know, you're really

22:22.740 --> 22:25.477
lucky we kept you out of
jail for a felony. Do you have

22:25.510 --> 22:29.981
any idea what they do to rich
basketball players in jail?

22:30.013 --> 22:32.050
Well, I'm sure
it gives a whole new meaning to

22:32.082 --> 22:33.817
the term
"taking it to the hole".

22:33.850 --> 22:37.522
Ah, yeah. But not so good for
somebody who plays defense as

22:37.554 --> 22:39.490
poorly as you do, pretty boy.

22:40.157 --> 22:41.759
Ouch.

22:41.792 --> 22:45.029
Yeah, but you know what?
Look, I got a plan for you.

22:45.061 --> 22:47.698
I don't
think you understand but your

22:47.732 --> 22:52.270
grief to dollar ratio is higher
than it's ever been in your

22:52.302 --> 22:54.037
entire career.

22:54.071 --> 22:56.608
Well that's
good, right? I mean, you're

22:56.640 --> 22:57.841
still making
money. What do you care?

22:57.876 --> 23:01.145
What are you, an idiot? I don't
think you understand the grief

23:01.177 --> 23:04.148
to dollar ratio concept. Huh?

23:04.180 --> 23:06.951
You don't get it, do you? You
know what? Let's roll the tape!

23:14.157 --> 23:17.861
Oh, come on!
Get up you commie or I'm gonna make you

23:17.895 --> 23:19.731
red, white, black and blue.

23:20.298 --> 23:21.733
Come on!

23:21.765 --> 23:24.201
What is this bullshit? Get up.

23:24.834 --> 23:28.939
Come on. This
is god damned ridiculous!

23:40.784 --> 23:44.121
You know, after all these years,

23:44.155 --> 23:46.190
you're costing us more money

23:46.223 --> 23:48.059
than you're making for us.

23:48.591 --> 23:52.162
Yeah, but you need me.
I'm Rich Johnson, super

23:52.196 --> 23:53.865
star basketball player.

23:53.898 --> 23:56.801
You're Rich Johnson,
super star ball buster!

23:58.602 --> 23:59.837
You my young friend

23:59.870 --> 24:02.907
are a PR nightmare. It's a full
time job managing your bullshit.

24:02.939 --> 24:05.976
All this crap has gone viral.
Now we're forced to fix it.

24:10.313 --> 24:14.017
You know, someone once said,

24:14.051 --> 24:17.254
"a man is only as
faithful as his options."

24:18.356 --> 24:19.891
Was that Abe Lincoln?

24:19.924 --> 24:22.961
No, it was Chris Rock.
And if you want to be

24:22.994 --> 24:25.830
faithful to this team, you have
one option if you want to stay

24:25.862 --> 24:30.734
in the league. Look at this
asshole! This is all your fault.

24:30.767 --> 24:31.969
Schmuck.

24:32.003 --> 24:34.038
It's
official, starting tomorrow, not

24:34.071 --> 24:37.908
only is Rich Johnson suspended
for the next 5 games of the

24:37.942 --> 24:41.279
championship series, but also
during the suspension he will

24:41.311 --> 24:44.215
have to lead a charity
basketball team, named the

24:44.247 --> 24:47.751
Sacramento Stars, to raise
money for various organizations.

24:47.784 --> 24:49.920
We are told if he screws up,

24:49.954 --> 24:52.190
he will be out of
the league for good...

24:52.223 --> 24:55.693
But if he completes his
service, he will be eligible to

24:55.725 --> 24:58.696
play in Game 7, if the
series even goes that far.

25:01.365 --> 25:03.101
I've got you, kid.

25:06.369 --> 25:08.406
Daddy, I wish
you didn't have to go.

25:08.438 --> 25:11.208
Yeah, you
me and the rest of the world.

25:11.775 --> 25:14.211
Sweetie, can we
have a minute, your dad and me?

25:18.215 --> 25:20.251
Hey, practice that three!

25:20.283 --> 25:22.119
You're going to be able
to keep your promise, right?

25:22.520 --> 25:25.189
CostumeCon? She has a tiny heart

25:25.222 --> 25:27.658
and she can't afford to
be broken by her hero. You.

25:27.692 --> 25:30.095
Of course. Yeah, ok,
I said I would be there.

25:34.298 --> 25:36.167
Hey, let me see that 3, come on.

25:37.234 --> 25:41.872
Hey son, why don't you take your
WBL MVP trophy and show these

25:41.906 --> 25:44.743
clowns what a real professional
basketball player looks like?

25:51.415 --> 25:53.118
It was a piece of shit anyway.

26:20.211 --> 26:23.381
You're not using
your ass enough, Luther.

26:23.747 --> 26:27.084
Come on, Mikey! Use it!

26:28.918 --> 26:32.189
Alright,
sweetie. I love you. Talk soon.

26:33.157 --> 26:34.425
I love you.

26:34.457 --> 26:36.393
I love you too. You got this.

26:36.426 --> 26:38.062
Dad.

26:38.362 --> 26:40.965
Yeah. Looks like it's gonna
be a lot of fun, son.

26:40.997 --> 26:44.268
Don't share any glasses
or needles with these guys.

26:46.971 --> 26:48.373
More like a carnival really.

27:09.159 --> 27:12.396
Hey, dude. I left my luggage
out there, but be careful,

27:12.428 --> 27:13.530
I've got a laptop.

27:13.563 --> 27:15.734
There ain't no bellhop
here and no man either.

27:16.266 --> 27:18.936
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

27:19.870 --> 27:22.907
Yeah, it's the haircut.
It fools a lot of people.

27:22.939 --> 27:26.910
Uh, yeah. It could be the
hair. It could also be the bass

27:26.944 --> 27:29.013
drum that seems
to lodged in your throat.

27:33.082 --> 27:35.887
Are you saying
I have a man's voice?

27:35.919 --> 27:39.556
Um, you know what I probably
just need to clean my ears.

27:39.590 --> 27:43.061
What up Hollywood
superstar in the house!

27:47.031 --> 27:49.200
How the hell did
you end up with these freaks?

27:49.233 --> 27:51.869
Man, it's a crazy story.
I think about 10 years ago...

27:54.003 --> 27:58.976
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Well I
guess that answers that.

27:59.543 --> 28:02.312
Ok. Let me get off you, here.

28:04.215 --> 28:05.850
Excuse me.

28:07.885 --> 28:09.887
Hey, bad idea.
That's Mobile's seat.

28:09.919 --> 28:12.122
Yeah,
well now it's my seat now.

28:12.555 --> 28:16.426
For a few seconds. Hint, they
don't call him Mobile because

28:16.459 --> 28:19.263
he's from Mobile Alabama...
even though he is from there.

28:31.407 --> 28:34.078
You're in my seat, Dick.

28:34.711 --> 28:39.117
Oh. Um, I
don't see your name anywhere.

28:39.617 --> 28:41.085
Thought you'd say that.

28:49.326 --> 28:51.529
Now you see how he
got his name.

28:51.561 --> 28:54.165
He moves people, literally.

28:54.197 --> 28:55.166
Tell him, Mathews.

28:55.198 --> 28:56.167
Literally!

28:56.199 --> 28:57.835
You better ask somebody.

29:04.942 --> 29:08.246
Well, thanks Mobile. I wanted
to use the restroom anyway.

29:22.993 --> 29:25.196
That's for
saying I sound like a man.

29:31.201 --> 29:33.204
He look like Avatar's shit.

29:39.510 --> 29:43.513
Oh, Luther,

29:43.546 --> 29:45.181
John Luther.

29:45.215 --> 29:46.317
Yeah, I'm
surprised you remember.

29:46.350 --> 29:49.186
Oh, come on
man. What happened to you?

29:49.218 --> 29:51.087
We were supposed to
be in the pros together.

29:51.120 --> 29:54.425
Oh wow.
Excuse me, man. Not all of us

29:54.457 --> 29:58.128
got drafted Mr. 1st rounder. I
went to Europe. That's the only

29:58.161 --> 30:00.430
That's the only ticket
I got so I took it.

30:00.464 --> 30:02.265
I made a nice life
for myself over there.

30:02.299 --> 30:04.668
Not, I mean, like your life,

30:04.702 --> 30:06.671
but I was able to
take care of my family.

30:06.704 --> 30:09.540
Alright well, at least you have
some pro experience, not like

30:09.572 --> 30:12.310
the rest of these losers.
What are you doing here?

30:13.711 --> 30:16.047
To keep living the dream, man.

30:16.080 --> 30:18.983
The dream?
This is more like a nightmare.

30:19.350 --> 30:24.054
Wow. Nightmare, nightmare. You
know what? You might surprise

30:24.088 --> 30:28.225
yourself by doing something you
actually like for someone else

30:28.257 --> 30:30.027
other than yourself.

30:31.094 --> 30:35.065
Ok. Alright.
Thanks, Tony Robbins.

30:35.099 --> 30:38.936
Yo!
Superstar needs a nickname.

30:39.803 --> 30:42.340
With a name like
Johnson, who needs one?

30:42.372 --> 30:46.043
Oh, ok. I get it. Johnson.

30:46.642 --> 30:49.713
Good one, Mobile.

30:57.186 --> 31:00.358
Oh, this is gonna suck.

31:17.774 --> 31:20.410
Another day, another dump.

31:20.444 --> 31:22.480
I hope this
place has indoor plumbing.

31:22.513 --> 31:26.350
Yo, Mike. You'll get some
serious double mattress action

31:26.382 --> 31:27.384
up in this piece.

31:27.417 --> 31:28.686
Don't tell nobody that shit!

31:28.718 --> 31:30.487
What the hell
does that mean?

31:30.521 --> 31:31.755
Better pray you never find out.

31:32.223 --> 31:34.591
Well let's just hope
that this place has a spa.

31:34.625 --> 31:37.728
No, but we gave you the luxury
suite with a Jacuzzi. They gave

31:37.761 --> 31:40.630
it to us for free because
tomorrow they're demolishing the

31:40.664 --> 31:42.133
hotel to build up some condos.

31:42.166 --> 31:43.634
A day too late.

31:43.667 --> 31:47.804
You know Rich, feel
free to trash the hotel room.

31:47.838 --> 31:48.773
You
know, get out all of your

31:48.805 --> 31:49.973
frustrations before
the first game, alright?

31:50.006 --> 31:54.244
I mean just tear shit up,
alright? Yeah, just go crazy.

32:05.488 --> 32:10.327
You want rock star? I'll show
you rock star. I'm Rich Johnson.

32:10.727 --> 32:12.529
I'm Rich Johnson,

32:12.562 --> 32:17.568
ten time WBL all star, all time
WBL leading scorer.

32:19.235 --> 32:22.339
Huh, Smegman! You hear
that, Smegman? Do you hear that?

32:22.371 --> 32:25.542
Oh, you don't hear me?
You wanna feel me, huh?

32:45.896 --> 32:49.734
I'm a rock star.
You feel that, Smegman?

32:50.134 --> 32:54.505
All time leading scorer. WBL!

33:08.185 --> 33:09.753
What in the hell
do you think you're doing?

33:10.221 --> 33:13.224
What's the problem? I thought
this place was being raised.

33:13.256 --> 33:14.792
You're building condos, right?

33:14.824 --> 33:17.427
Looks like
you're building a bloody nest.

33:22.765 --> 33:24.869
Hey, he fell
for the old demolition gag! This

33:24.901 --> 33:27.437
week is gonna be the best week
we've ever had within a week.

33:27.838 --> 33:30.475
Hey, this ain't
the WBL superstar!

33:32.208 --> 33:35.145
Welcome to the stars, baby.

33:38.748 --> 33:42.385
Juvenile. Just juvenile.

33:48.591 --> 33:51.395
Hey, it's me.
How's the knee?

33:52.462 --> 33:55.733
Good. Considering now I look

33:55.765 --> 33:59.436
like Papa Smurf. I got thrown in

33:59.468 --> 34:03.806
the air like a rag doll and
don't let me forget the 10,000

34:03.840 --> 34:06.276
dollars in damages I've
got to pay for this hotel room.

34:06.310 --> 34:08.244
Well look at the
bright side. At least your dad's

34:08.277 --> 34:11.214
not on the tour with you and
you've got CostumeCon coming up

34:11.248 --> 34:12.483
with you daughter.

34:12.516 --> 34:15.920
And at least we get to play some
basketball tomorrow, finally.

34:19.822 --> 34:21.292
Who are you playing?

34:21.324 --> 34:23.359
Some team called the ABS.

34:23.393 --> 34:25.563
They're supposedly the
greatest athletes in the

34:25.596 --> 34:27.931
world but they're
like a bunch of crybabies.

34:27.964 --> 34:31.467
Mmm.
Sounds fun. Well, I love you.

34:32.368 --> 34:34.371
Alright. You too.

34:46.016 --> 34:48.252
Alright, Rich. Let's keep in

34:48.284 --> 34:51.487
mind that this is for charity,
man. Alright so we've got to let

34:51.520 --> 34:54.389
them score some points
and we've got to let them win.

34:54.424 --> 34:55.893
We can't them
walking around here crying.

34:55.926 --> 34:58.494
That's the weirdest pep talk
I've ever heard.

34:58.527 --> 34:59.830
Are you kidding me?

34:59.862 --> 35:04.868
Gentlemen,
you are the best of the best of the best.

35:06.270 --> 35:08.772
Are you
kidding me? This is-

35:08.804 --> 35:11.274
This is insane. I thought we
were playing a real

35:11.308 --> 35:13.510
basketball game.

35:13.543 --> 35:15.512
I thought we were playing the
ABS. You know, athletes

35:15.545 --> 35:19.717
with six packs. This looks like
a friggin' playground.

35:19.750 --> 35:22.418
Uh, no. We
are playing against the ABS, but

35:22.451 --> 35:24.721
it's the Adult Baby Society.

35:29.226 --> 35:30.962
Don't you watch
Jerry Springer, man?

35:37.067 --> 35:40.003
Oh! Sorry, sorry
babies. My bad.

35:40.837 --> 35:42.806
I think you
might want to use this.

35:44.775 --> 35:48.545
Yo, who's your daddy? I'm your
daddy, that's right.

35:48.578 --> 35:50.581
Yeah, your mama's a ho.

35:57.587 --> 36:02.493
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Come on. Stop crying. Don't cry.

36:02.525 --> 36:04.560
Come on, just be cool.

36:04.594 --> 36:06.764
Just be cool, man.

36:06.797 --> 36:08.831
I don't know
what's going on with him.

36:08.864 --> 36:11.268
Don't cry. Come on,
no, no, no. stop.

36:11.935 --> 36:14.337
Come on.

36:14.371 --> 36:15.706
Mean, mean man!

36:16.038 --> 36:19.075
I'm mean? I'm
mean? Oh come on,

36:19.109 --> 36:23.913
don't be such a baby. Here
we go, ok, here we go, ok.

36:26.782 --> 36:27.951
Ohhhhhhhh!

36:29.118 --> 36:30.754
Ay caramba!

36:33.790 --> 36:35.692
I think you gonna
need a diaper after that.

36:36.927 --> 36:40.864
That's a testicle that's
a technical foul.

36:40.897 --> 36:42.665
You just got yourself
a time out.

36:42.699 --> 36:46.570
Come here. Get in the corner.

36:46.603 --> 36:49.340
You alright, man?
You gonna need a diaper, man?

37:31.915 --> 37:34.552
What is that smell?

37:40.156 --> 37:41.758
You shit yourself boy?

37:45.494 --> 37:47.663
Time out.

37:57.574 --> 37:59.476
C'mon sweetie, c'mon babies

37:59.509 --> 38:02.679
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the halftime baby races.

38:02.712 --> 38:05.516
Drinky drinky! Drinky drinky!

38:05.549 --> 38:07.518
Babies are crouched
at the starting line.

38:07.551 --> 38:09.152
The parents are ready too.

38:09.185 --> 38:10.153
I got five...

38:10.186 --> 38:11.889
Bets are being placed.

38:11.922 --> 38:13.424
I got double or nothing-

38:13.456 --> 38:15.058
And some are high.

38:15.891 --> 38:17.794
And they are off.

38:17.828 --> 38:20.931
Big little baby is pulling ahead

38:20.964 --> 38:23.967
and Baby shit your pants is
right behind him.

38:24.234 --> 38:27.571
Jason Mamoa
baby is falling behind.

38:27.603 --> 38:29.572
Who is gonna-

38:31.241 --> 38:34.143
It looks like we've
taken a double D detour.

38:34.177 --> 38:36.881
It's ok. It's no problem.

38:44.221 --> 38:46.623
Tig ol bitties.

38:46.656 --> 38:47.924
Don't
fall asleep. Don't fall asleep.

38:47.958 --> 38:49.226
Don't fall asleep.
Don't fall asleep.

38:49.259 --> 38:50.726
I think I'm in love.

38:50.759 --> 38:52.161
It looks like the race is over.

38:52.194 --> 38:53.663
Come on, babies.

38:54.297 --> 38:56.900
Mama, mama, mama.

38:56.933 --> 38:59.802
I mean, who wouldn't
want to suck on those titties?

39:00.871 --> 39:03.007
Game over! It's feeding time.

39:03.906 --> 39:07.677
Hey man, not bad for your
first game. Now tomorrow, I'm

39:07.710 --> 39:09.712
going to introduce
you to a big fan of yours.

39:09.746 --> 39:12.215
Oh, you mean we're
not playing the adult furries?

39:12.248 --> 39:17.020
Oh man, I think I'm
gonna go find that woman.

39:22.659 --> 39:26.697
Whooh! It is hot out here.
Why are we here, again?

39:26.730 --> 39:28.732
Worthington
is the biggest sponsor we have.

39:28.764 --> 39:30.766
He always
writes a fat check. Now I never

39:30.799 --> 39:34.203
met the man, but now that you're
on the team he wants us to make

39:34.237 --> 39:35.706
a personal appearance.

39:35.739 --> 39:36.807
Of course he does.

39:36.839 --> 39:40.076
Apparently he loves
his animals. Are you allergic?

39:40.110 --> 39:41.712
Not that I know of.

39:41.744 --> 39:43.047
Man, that is a big turtle.

39:43.080 --> 39:45.982
Hello gentlemen.
I was just taking Augie for his walk.

39:46.016 --> 39:48.619
Mr. Worthington's
is waiting for you, inside.

39:48.652 --> 39:51.188
You'll be taking lemonade
with him on the patio.

39:51.221 --> 39:52.790
Oh, lemonade.

39:53.924 --> 39:55.525
Later Augie.

39:59.696 --> 40:00.730
Mr. Worthington?

40:00.764 --> 40:03.234
In here, gentlemen.

40:06.268 --> 40:10.040
Welcome.
This is Mr. Dingles.

40:10.072 --> 40:13.243
He's a recent rescue.
He's a little bit naughty.

40:14.078 --> 40:16.880
But then sometimes I
like them naughty.

40:16.913 --> 40:19.983
And you've been naughty.
Oh, Mr. Dingles.

40:20.016 --> 40:22.686
Where are you going?

40:24.219 --> 40:27.924
Mm.

40:28.391 --> 40:30.127
Let
me give you the personal tour

40:30.159 --> 40:34.063
and then after we can grab some
lemonade. So, as you can see,

40:34.096 --> 40:38.000
I'm an animal lover. Cats,
tortoises, whatever. But then

40:38.034 --> 40:40.203
there's the
love of my life Raoul.

40:40.235 --> 40:43.306
Raoul.
Oh, Raoul. Oh yeah,

40:43.339 --> 40:47.176
We met him outside.
Hey, what's up Raoul?

40:47.677 --> 40:52.015
No, silly.
That's just my butler.

40:52.047 --> 40:56.953
No, Raoul is a parrot.
Yes, this is us in front of the Eiffel

40:56.987 --> 40:59.924
Tower and we went to Rio.

41:01.223 --> 41:03.226
That must be where
the honeymoon was.

41:03.793 --> 41:07.096
Would you like to
meet Raoul? He's in my bedroom.

41:07.596 --> 41:11.067
Oh, um, yeah. We don't have

41:11.101 --> 41:13.369
to meet Raoul right now.
We could probably like

41:13.402 --> 41:16.372
Oh, come on you!

41:16.406 --> 41:19.810
Oh
Randy, when the lemonade is

41:19.842 --> 41:21.243
ready, ring the little bell ok?

41:21.277 --> 41:23.080
Yes, Mr. Worthington.

41:27.851 --> 41:30.186
You know, if
Raoul's asleep we

41:30.219 --> 41:31.254
could just come back later.

41:31.288 --> 41:34.324
No, he'd just hate me
if he missed meeting you.

41:35.991 --> 41:38.828
Here he is,

41:38.862 --> 41:40.197
my pride and joy.

41:42.031 --> 41:43.366
This is Raoul.

41:43.833 --> 41:46.703
We're celebrating
our 30th Anniversary.

41:48.804 --> 41:51.074
Sorry, do you uh do you mind?

41:52.042 --> 41:53.677
Take off whatever you want.

41:53.710 --> 41:55.878
Hey there,
Raoul. How ya doing, buddy?

41:55.911 --> 41:57.246
Raoul want a cracker?

41:57.279 --> 42:00.016
Kiss my ass. Kiss my ass.
Johnson's a dick.

42:00.049 --> 42:01.150
Johnson's a dick.

42:04.721 --> 42:06.190
Time for lemonade.

42:08.991 --> 42:10.726
Oh, I forgot my jacket.

42:10.759 --> 42:11.727
Weinergate!

42:11.761 --> 42:12.696
Just shut the door behind you.

42:12.728 --> 42:16.032
Weinergate.
Ball-hog pussy. Ball-hog pussy!

42:16.065 --> 42:18.701
Alright, shut up Raoul, ok?

42:18.735 --> 42:19.970
Ball hog!
Ball hog! Weinergate!

42:20.203 --> 42:23.306
Weinergate! Ball,
ball, ball, ball hog! Hog!

42:23.339 --> 42:25.042
I'm warning you Raoul.
You'd better zip it.

42:28.143 --> 42:29.712
F you Raoul!

43:09.152 --> 43:11.188
Hey mom, does this look ok?

43:11.821 --> 43:16.326
Wow! That's fantastic. Even
Superman would be jealous.

43:17.092 --> 43:19.730
I only have 4 days to
get it ready for CostumeCon!

43:19.763 --> 43:20.964
You're gonna get it done.

43:21.464 --> 43:25.268
I know I will. But do you think
Dad will be there to wear it?

43:26.235 --> 43:30.072
I think even your dad can
manage to stay out of trouble

43:30.105 --> 43:33.810
for 4 days.

43:34.877 --> 43:37.346
At least I hope.

44:34.770 --> 44:39.008
It has been
such a wonderful afternoon.

44:39.641 --> 44:43.212
I'll be right back
with that fat check.

44:43.846 --> 44:45.815
What are you doing tonight?

44:45.848 --> 44:48.351
Uh me? Um...

44:49.853 --> 44:51.121
Oh, we have practice.

44:51.154 --> 44:52.121
We don't have practice.

44:52.154 --> 44:54.824
We have practice.
We have practice tonight.

44:54.857 --> 44:55.825
We're practicing.

44:55.859 --> 44:56.994
You two work it out.

45:00.295 --> 45:03.167
Oh wow, that was awkward.

45:05.567 --> 45:07.369
Hey, where's your jacket?

45:07.402 --> 45:09.572
Aw, damn.
I'll be right back.

45:09.605 --> 45:10.973
Alright, man.

45:15.078 --> 45:17.179
Holy shit!

45:22.185 --> 45:24.154
Holy shit!

45:28.090 --> 45:29.558
Where's the bird?

45:29.592 --> 45:31.360
In Mr. Dingles.

45:31.393 --> 45:32.596
Oh shit.

45:33.429 --> 45:34.598
What's going on?

45:34.630 --> 45:35.898
Nothing. Nothing.

45:45.208 --> 45:48.144
You
naughty, naughty men.

45:48.177 --> 45:53.183
You didn't shut the door behind
you. And you killed my love.

45:53.683 --> 45:55.418
Now hold on a second. Raoul

45:55.451 --> 46:00.190
was smack talking me. More
than Larry Bird. Larry Bird.

46:00.223 --> 46:05.228
My 5-dollar cat
ate my priceless Raoul.

46:08.364 --> 46:12.034
Hey, I'm so sorry, but
can we still get that check?

46:17.040 --> 46:19.042
Get out.

46:19.074 --> 46:22.478
Ok. Ok. Ok.

46:25.681 --> 46:27.950
I'm so sorry,
I just have to get my jacket.

46:27.984 --> 46:30.152
Get out!

46:46.002 --> 46:47.971
You wanna see
something really freaky?

46:50.373 --> 46:52.641
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, I'm pretty sure this does

46:52.674 --> 46:54.610
not qualify as consensual.

46:55.078 --> 46:59.116
Relax superstar. I really
wanna just show you this. Oh!

47:00.116 --> 47:05.021
That is nasty! That is nasty.

47:05.054 --> 47:07.958
What happened?

47:07.991 --> 47:09.192
What you showed him?

47:09.225 --> 47:11.728
Shit happens, baby!

47:11.761 --> 47:15.299
Oh yeah! You really suck!

47:16.098 --> 47:17.700
It's gonna
be hard to top that one.

47:17.734 --> 47:20.603
No, actually
don't be too sure about that.

47:20.636 --> 47:25.507
Check this out. Huh? Got this
baby at my bachelor party.

47:25.540 --> 47:27.676
Almost got divorced
right before I got married.

47:27.710 --> 47:30.045
Ok, ok, hey, hey, ok, ok.

47:30.078 --> 47:32.114
I got one. I got one. Hold on.

47:36.719 --> 47:38.355
Dude, that's a tramp stamp.

47:40.288 --> 47:41.256
What'd you say Mike?

47:41.290 --> 47:42.558
It's a tramp stamp!

47:44.594 --> 47:46.763
Whoa, Mobile.
Bring it down. Bring it down.

47:46.795 --> 47:49.331
It's art. It's art.
Life imitates art.

47:49.364 --> 47:51.033
Yeah, yeah.

47:52.735 --> 47:56.239
What are you guys playing
inch worm with your dicks out

47:56.272 --> 47:58.342
back here?

47:58.808 --> 48:00.343
I'm going to the bathroom.

48:02.511 --> 48:06.415
Hey Cari, if you're
back here who's driving?

48:06.449 --> 48:07.584
Nick's driving the bus.

48:17.159 --> 48:19.094
Luther, I can't find my shorts.

48:19.127 --> 48:21.163
Don't trip. I got you.

48:23.699 --> 48:25.201
Aren't these a little short?

48:25.234 --> 48:27.471
Uh, just
tuck them in, Ballz.

48:30.072 --> 48:31.473
Hey man,
don't you worry about suiting

48:31.507 --> 48:34.110
up. We've got a different
uniform for you today.

48:34.143 --> 48:35.712
Let me guess.
Smegman's idea?

48:35.744 --> 48:37.279
Anybody hate you
more than Smegman?

48:37.313 --> 48:39.715
This season?
No, I don't think anybody.

48:39.748 --> 48:42.185
Look, if you really want a
chance to play in Game 7,

48:42.217 --> 48:43.118
you'll do it.

48:43.152 --> 48:45.788
Fine. You know
what? It'll be a cakewalk.

48:45.822 --> 48:49.492
Yeah, that's what you keep
saying. Hey, hey, I don't

48:49.525 --> 48:52.228
suggest you
eating locker room sushi.

48:52.261 --> 48:55.398
Oh,
come on. Just like that hotel

48:55.431 --> 48:57.134
was gonna be demolished, right?

48:59.502 --> 49:02.639
Man, listen. I'm telling you.
That's like eating 7-11 sushi.

49:02.672 --> 49:03.773
Man, don't.

49:04.473 --> 49:08.110
Nick, you never finished your
story. How did you end up here?

49:08.143 --> 49:10.379
Yeah, man. It's a crazy
ride so basically

49:11.413 --> 49:13.182
Dude, what the hell was that?

49:13.215 --> 49:14.551
I'm trying to
stop you from passing

49:14.583 --> 49:16.152
out in the middle of your story.

49:16.185 --> 49:17.587
Oh, thanks.

49:18.955 --> 49:20.190
State Championship.
They're gonna need a miracle.

49:20.223 --> 49:21.123
The all American Nick!

49:21.157 --> 49:23.426
He steals the ball! He's
going all the way!

49:23.458 --> 49:25.627
Does he
have it? Oh my God.

49:25.661 --> 49:26.561
Seriously?

49:26.596 --> 49:29.099
Is he sleeping? Oh Canada has

49:29.132 --> 49:31.601
lost the game and
Nick has lost his career.

49:31.634 --> 49:33.235
and the worst part is...

49:34.302 --> 49:35.505
Ok.

49:35.538 --> 49:38.340
Alright well,
sweet dreams little buddy.

49:46.681 --> 49:48.517
What is this?

49:48.551 --> 49:50.719
I thought it'd be a good
idea to loosen up with a little

49:50.752 --> 49:52.288
yoga before today's game.

49:52.855 --> 49:56.826
Welcome gentlemen and Namaste.

49:57.194 --> 49:59.862
Nah, I'm a leaving.

49:59.895 --> 50:02.297
Yoga's for bitches, dude.

50:02.331 --> 50:05.835
It's a common
misconception. Yoga is for males

50:05.868 --> 50:09.505
as well. It comes from a place
of strength. It actually helped

50:09.538 --> 50:13.142
me get through my recent
divorce. Now I want you to all

50:13.176 --> 50:16.413
say it with me and
totally buy in. Namaste.

50:16.880 --> 50:19.482
Namaste.

50:19.514 --> 50:22.784
Beautiful. Beautiful.
Bring it back to center.

50:22.817 --> 50:24.253
There we go
and we're gonna reach our

50:24.286 --> 50:25.455
arms out for our first stretch.

50:25.487 --> 50:28.790
A modified warrior. Really
stretch out. Yeah, feel it in

50:28.824 --> 50:32.494
your delts. And then just move
from side to side there you go.

50:32.527 --> 50:35.665
As if you're being served
divorce papers and you don't

50:35.697 --> 50:39.902
want to see them. No, get out
of here. Get out. I thought you

50:39.935 --> 50:43.205
were a hotdog vendor,
not an agent of the court.

50:44.105 --> 50:47.743
Side to side, beautiful. I
love what you're doing, yes.

50:48.210 --> 50:50.513
And we're going to bring it
back to center. There we go.

50:50.545 --> 50:53.448
Breathe in, breathe out.

50:53.482 --> 50:57.387
Time for the Fatalis pose. Reach

50:57.420 --> 50:58.621
those arms out this time with

50:58.654 --> 51:01.924
your palms facing up. And we're
going to ever so gently bend

51:01.958 --> 51:03.593
those biceps, bringing your

51:03.625 --> 51:07.696
palms up to your face like
you're wondering,

51:08.163 --> 51:10.465
How did I ever get to this
moment?

51:10.498 --> 51:13.435
How did I end up here"

51:13.469 --> 51:16.773
Oh, he is fucked up.

51:16.806 --> 51:18.708
Where'd you find this guy?

51:18.741 --> 51:20.342
Downtown at the fitness center.

51:20.375 --> 51:22.244
He works at
the downtown fitness center?

51:22.277 --> 51:25.881
No, no, no, no. He lives behind
the fitness center in the alley.

51:28.016 --> 51:32.955
And we're back to center. We're
back to center, beautiful. Now

51:32.989 --> 51:36.391
we're going to end this session
as I've ended every night since

51:36.424 --> 51:39.261
my wife left,
by leaning forward.

51:39.761 --> 51:42.264
Just slightly leaning forward.
We're going to grab onto those

51:42.297 --> 51:45.368
glutes for support. Loosen up
our neck. That will be very

51:45.400 --> 51:48.804
important and just bring your
head all the way down and try

51:48.837 --> 51:50.239
and suck your own dick.

51:50.272 --> 51:51.307
They're just praying, honey.

51:51.340 --> 51:53.509
Just try and suck your own dick.
Really go for it.

51:53.542 --> 51:54.777
What the fuck?

51:54.810 --> 51:57.880
Loosen up. We're losing some but
we're gaining others in spirit.

51:57.913 --> 51:59.983
That's ok. I do private lessons.

52:02.485 --> 52:04.020
What the
fuck is wrong with you, man?

52:04.052 --> 52:06.623
I do privates. It's ok,
I can work with you later.

52:06.989 --> 52:10.627
Ladies and gentlemen,
introducing Rich Johnson as

52:10.659 --> 52:12.027
twinkle the star.

52:13.261 --> 52:17.699
That's right. Mr. Twinkle,
coming through. Yes ok, gonna

52:17.732 --> 52:21.703

this. Yup. Sorry about my rays

52:21.737 --> 52:25.508
hitting you. Watch out, rays
coming through. Whoa, whoa,

52:25.540 --> 52:29.578
whoa, whoa. Sorry, sorry, ok.

52:29.612 --> 52:31.748
A lot of touching going on. Oh

52:34.449 --> 52:37.719

52:37.752 --> 52:40.856
whooh...

52:41.324 --> 52:46.529
Ok. I hate you. I hate
all of you. This is a nightmare.

52:50.465 --> 52:53.969
Oh, yellow
is your color Mr. Sunshine. Oh,

52:54.002 --> 52:56.872
mustard boy. I didn't know
Big Bird liked basketball.

52:57.973 --> 53:00.810
Screw you, Luther. Screw you!

53:00.842 --> 53:01.911
Alright Old Yeller.

53:03.212 --> 53:06.581
Ladies and Gentlemen,
please welcome your celebrity

53:06.614 --> 53:08.984
referee, Pierre the Mime.

53:53.094 --> 53:55.364
Here you go.

53:55.397 --> 53:56.999
Alright
guys, bring it in, bring it in.

54:05.607 --> 54:09.478
Ok look. Now I know you guys are
looking at me to make this Vince

54:09.511 --> 54:10.712
Lombardi type speech, right?

54:10.746 --> 54:11.947
Who's Vince Lombardi?

54:11.980 --> 54:14.417
Just pay attention, man! But
listen, we gotta keep with the

54:14.449 --> 54:17.386
game plan, alright? Keep the
game close and let them win.

54:17.853 --> 54:19.388
Nick! Nick! Wake up!

54:19.422 --> 54:21.757
I was up. I was up. Sorry.

54:21.790 --> 54:24.393
You drooled a
little. Hey, I don't think we're

54:24.427 --> 54:26.129
gonna have a
problem losing to these guys.

54:26.161 --> 54:28.563
Bullshit! We
can beat anybody we wanna beat.

54:28.596 --> 54:30.732
I don't know,
Mobile. These monks can ball.

54:41.543 --> 54:45.447
There we go.
Pizza here. Get your pizza.

54:45.880 --> 54:50.085
Yeah! Some pizza for
you, yeah. Here you go.

54:50.118 --> 54:51.053
Over here.

54:51.087 --> 54:52.755
Here you go.
Wait, hold on a second. Here you

54:52.788 --> 54:53.923

54:53.956 --> 54:54.924
I want a piece.

54:54.956 --> 54:57.826
Oh, sorry, sorry,
sorry. Hello. All for you.

54:57.860 --> 54:58.961
Thank you.
Enjoy.

54:58.993 --> 55:02.164
Ah! Oh. I am so sorry.

55:02.665 --> 55:05.034
Sir, I'm, I'm I'm, I'm so sorry.

55:05.067 --> 55:06.302
Let me just get that for you

55:06.335 --> 55:09.005
here. There's some napkins. I
think that'll come out. I'm so

55:09.038 --> 55:12.442
sorry to you and
your whole gang. Ok, ok.

55:18.647 --> 55:19.681
Jump ball won by the

55:19.714 --> 55:20.816
Monks.

55:23.752 --> 55:28.491
Over to Red.
He shoots. He scores.

55:29.859 --> 55:31.127
Monks steal the ball.

55:33.996 --> 55:37.032
Number 25 doing
some mime action and

55:41.237 --> 55:42.905
it appears that Mr. Happy

55:42.938 --> 55:46.008
Star is going for the it's Rich

55:46.040 --> 55:48.977
Johnson and he's drinking the

55:49.011 --> 55:53.949
holy water. Holy crap, the nuns
are horrified! Back to the game.

55:54.917 --> 55:56.652
He shoots he scores.

56:00.089 --> 56:03.159
Slam dunk
and he pledges himself! Ballz

56:03.192 --> 56:06.728
putting on a one man show. He
drives to the hoop and it's up,

56:06.761 --> 56:08.063
slam dunk!

56:08.496 --> 56:10.565
There you go, boy!

56:10.598 --> 56:12.801
And the Sacramento
Stars pleasuring each other down

56:12.835 --> 56:14.571
the court.

56:16.772 --> 56:19.542
And it's to the Monks
and they score again!

56:19.574 --> 56:21.977
Friar Tuck holding position.

56:23.112 --> 56:26.782
Big Red rejects!

56:26.815 --> 56:28.985
Big Red's feeling
power surging through him.

56:29.018 --> 56:32.155
Big Red passes and
another score for the Monks.

56:34.188 --> 56:36.225
Help!

56:38.761 --> 56:41.697
Time out Stars.

56:42.098 --> 56:45.668
We're experiencing
technical difficulties.

57:00.081 --> 57:02.685
And it looks like
Ballz has the ball and putting

57:02.717 --> 57:07.255
on a show, dominating this court
all the way down, the master of

57:07.288 --> 57:08.657
his domain.

57:09.924 --> 57:11.060
Come on Ballz, you got it.

57:11.092 --> 57:12.694
I taught him that one.

57:21.703 --> 57:23.038
Ballz!

57:23.072 --> 57:25.742
We now know
why they call him balls.

57:26.509 --> 57:28.311
When I said
show em what you got,

57:28.344 --> 57:30.179
I didn't mean show 'em
what you got, got!

57:30.212 --> 57:31.880
Uh...

57:31.913 --> 57:34.883
Oh, ho, ho,
that's what I call a loose ball

57:34.917 --> 57:36.819
foul on deez nutz.

57:37.953 --> 57:41.324
Twinkle is going to
attempt a mascot record, jumping

57:41.357 --> 57:45.295
over not 1 but 5 monks for
your halftime entertainment!

57:53.835 --> 57:54.971
Hey man, are you alright?

57:55.003 --> 57:56.906
Ugh. I don't feel so good.

57:57.572 --> 58:00.810
See, I told you not to eat that
locker room sushi.

58:00.842 --> 58:01.877
You didn't want to listen.

58:01.909 --> 58:02.978
(FART SOUND)

58:03.011 --> 58:06.281
Oh, wow!

58:06.815 --> 58:08.384
Ready when you are Twinkles.

58:08.417 --> 58:10.886
Hey man, you sure
you want to do this?

58:10.918 --> 58:13.922
Alright, alright. Look if you
shat yourself it's not my fault.

58:27.902 --> 58:30.739
My fucking nuts! Oh!

58:30.772 --> 58:32.674
So much for his vow of silence.

58:34.009 --> 58:36.813
I'm so sorry,
Brother Monk. Am I forgiven?

58:37.346 --> 58:41.217
You are an asshole.

58:48.723 --> 58:52.827
Whooh. Hey man, well at
least you've got tomorrow off.

58:52.860 --> 58:54.429
It'll give you a
little time to recuperate.

58:54.462 --> 58:56.865
Yeah, yeah. Maybe.

58:57.833 --> 58:59.935
I gotta say man,

58:59.967 --> 59:03.205
you've been good at
taking crap from the guys,

59:03.237 --> 59:05.875
especially for a guy who
walks around with a stick

59:05.907 --> 59:08.344
up his ass. I mean it's a little
stick, but you gotta stick

59:08.377 --> 59:10.380
up your ass.

59:10.779 --> 59:13.348
I'm just messing with you man.
You alright.

59:13.382 --> 59:18.220
Thank you. You know
to show my appreciation to you

59:18.252 --> 59:22.257
guys, I'd love to
cook you all dinner.

59:22.857 --> 59:24.826
Get
the fuck out of here. You cook?

59:24.860 --> 59:27.897
Yeah, no,
well. I'm a good cook. I make a

59:27.929 --> 59:32.067
mean steak. Some
would say it's the balls.

59:32.868 --> 59:38.074
Um, alright. Hey, I'm always
down for a good meal. Alright?

59:38.273 --> 59:39.074
Ok.

59:39.107 --> 59:41.109
My man.
Alright, I'll see you then.

59:41.143 --> 59:43.780
See you. See you then.

59:45.947 --> 59:47.882
See you then.

59:47.915 --> 59:49.184
Mmmm.

59:50.451 --> 59:53.822
Alright, huh, guys, you see?

59:53.855 --> 59:56.725
I gotta say bro,
you are not lying.

59:56.759 --> 59:59.161
This steak is off the chain.

59:59.694 --> 01:00:02.030
This actually might
be the first time Nick

01:00:02.063 --> 01:00:03.899
stays awake
for the entire dinner.

01:00:05.134 --> 01:00:07.969
No, he didn't.

01:00:08.002 --> 01:00:11.106
Here guys, let me top you off
with some of Napa Valley's

01:00:11.139 --> 01:00:12.842
finest Penis Noir.

01:00:12.875 --> 01:00:14.476
Pinot Noir.

01:00:14.509 --> 01:00:15.877
Pinot Noir.

01:00:18.313 --> 01:00:19.849
Yo, you got more?

01:00:19.882 --> 01:00:22.018
Oh, yeah. Of course.

01:00:25.119 --> 01:00:27.889
Whoa, how
did that get in there?

01:00:30.793 --> 01:00:32.361
I love to
cook for my friends.

01:00:32.927 --> 01:00:35.764
Yo, you gotta tell me
what you put on this, man.

01:00:35.797 --> 01:00:36.998
It's delicious.

01:00:37.031 --> 01:00:39.367
Yeah, sure,
sure, sure. I start with a

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:42.837
little dry rub,
a little aged dry rub and

01:00:42.871 --> 01:00:46.142
just a sprinkle of

01:00:46.174 --> 01:00:48.243
Fromunda cheese
before I slap it on the grill.

01:00:48.277 --> 01:00:50.279
Mmm! My mom
used to make Fromunda.

01:00:50.311 --> 01:00:51.781
Wow.

01:00:51.813 --> 01:00:53.882
What kind of cheese?

01:00:53.915 --> 01:00:58.853
It's Fromunda cheese. Fromunda
cheese. Fromunda cheese.

01:00:58.886 --> 01:01:01.990
Fromunda my balls. Yeah! Yeah!

01:01:06.094 --> 01:01:07.396
Oh my God!

01:01:07.429 --> 01:01:09.131
You guys
just ate my balls. That's what

01:01:09.163 --> 01:01:10.398
you get for all those pranks!

01:01:10.431 --> 01:01:11.299
You mean to
tell me I'll kill you!

01:01:11.333 --> 01:01:13.836
I'll see you
tomorrow, teammates! Yeah!

01:01:13.868 --> 01:01:16.371
Get his ass! Get his ass!

01:01:28.217 --> 01:01:30.386
That is exquisite.

01:01:30.953 --> 01:01:33.455
Mr. Smegman, when are you
going to get me out of this hell

01:01:33.487 --> 01:01:36.157
hole and back in the
championship in game 7?

01:01:36.190 --> 01:01:37.993
Really?

01:01:38.025 --> 01:01:41.029
Well let's review your
accomplishments so far, genius.

01:01:41.063 --> 01:01:43.833
Number 1: You caused Weinergate

01:01:43.866 --> 01:01:47.503
to go viral. Number 2: You
completely trashed a hotel room.

01:01:47.536 --> 01:01:52.007
Number 3: And I hope you're
proud of this, you made an adult

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:55.844
baby cry. Number 4: You killed

01:01:55.877 --> 01:01:57.979
a priceless parrot. And my

01:01:58.013 --> 01:02:00.482
favorite, number 5: You gave a

01:02:00.514 --> 01:02:04.453
monk an unwanted
an unnecessary vasectomy.

01:02:04.485 --> 01:02:06.922
40 years, Mr. Smegman.

01:02:06.955 --> 01:02:08.958
40 years of what?

01:02:08.991 --> 01:02:13.494
Since the Sacramento Royals have
won a WBL Championship.

01:02:13.527 --> 01:02:16.297
Now look,
I know you hate me, but

01:02:16.331 --> 01:02:19.001
this league needs me, ok?

01:02:19.034 --> 01:02:22.905
My team needs me. With my
underdog story, these ratings

01:02:22.938 --> 01:02:25.374
will be huge. You gotta
get me back to the championship.

01:02:25.406 --> 01:02:27.909
You gotta get me to Game 7.

01:02:27.942 --> 01:02:31.112
You know
kid, there's an old saying, if

01:02:31.145 --> 01:02:34.382
you keep saying that everybody
is an asshole then maybe the

01:02:34.415 --> 01:02:36.517
asshole is you.

01:02:36.551 --> 01:02:38.587
You love your quotes don't you?

01:02:38.619 --> 01:02:41.422
No, I
just love fortune cookies. I am

01:02:41.456 --> 01:02:46.161
giving you one more chance,
pretty boy. Don't fuck it up.

01:02:46.194 --> 01:02:48.464
You won't be sorry.

01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:18.194
Damn Jenny, that is good.

01:03:20.328 --> 01:03:22.931
Sacramento's buzzing
with excitement for game 7.

01:03:22.964 --> 01:03:24.232
The Royals are
anxiously awaiting word

01:03:24.266 --> 01:03:25.567
if Rich will
be eligible to play.

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.502
We're gonna have
so much fun, man. Hey

01:03:27.536 --> 01:03:29.972
Rich, I want you to meet Stan.

01:03:30.005 --> 01:03:33.309
He is the President of the TSA.
He's in charge of getting you to

01:03:33.342 --> 01:03:35.644
the airport after the game. You
know he's got a friend who works

01:03:35.677 --> 01:03:36.679
at airport security.

01:03:36.712 --> 01:03:38.013
Oh, what do you say?

01:03:38.045 --> 01:03:39.047
Stan the man.

01:03:39.081 --> 01:03:41.417
Oh, huge fan, man. Huge fan.

01:03:41.717 --> 01:03:45.487
Fuck! Fuck!
Cocksucker! Motherfucker!

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:46.655
I'm so sorry, I thought that you

01:03:46.688 --> 01:03:48.057
just said that
you were a huge fan.

01:03:48.089 --> 01:03:51.693
Oh yeah,
I am a huge fan. Tittyficker!

01:03:51.726 --> 01:03:54.562
Tittyfuck! Limp
dick motherfucker!

01:03:54.929 --> 01:03:57.699
Fuck! Fucking shit!

01:03:58.333 --> 01:04:02.371
Ok, I think I
get it now. TSA stands for

01:04:02.404 --> 01:04:06.208
Jizz weasel motherfuckin'
shitballs! Whoohooo!

01:04:06.241 --> 01:04:08.945
Ok, let's get out there and
raise some money for the TSA.

01:04:10.177 --> 01:04:11.647
Get me through
the airport security so I can

01:04:11.679 --> 01:04:12.982
make it to CostumeCon.

01:04:15.183 --> 01:04:19.722
You ever see a fatty who
could fly? Gookaw! Gookaw!

01:04:26.761 --> 01:04:29.297
Military Mic Mac motherfucker!

01:05:46.107 --> 01:05:48.443
Ass hat! Skittles!

01:05:48.476 --> 01:05:53.114
Daisy! Dick weed!
Rich Johnson sucks the big one!

01:05:53.147 --> 01:05:56.084
Ok look, I understand that
you suffer from Tourette's

01:05:56.118 --> 01:05:59.487
Syndrome and you can't control
yourself but really just try and

01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:00.656
take it down a notch.

01:06:00.688 --> 01:06:02.523
I don't have
Tourette's Syndrome.

01:06:02.556 --> 01:06:04.560
I just think you're a big dick!

01:06:05.127 --> 01:06:07.529
You thought
we had Tourette's?

01:06:07.830 --> 01:06:08.764
You don't?

01:06:08.797 --> 01:06:12.568
Hey Rich, TSA stands
for Therapeutic Swearers

01:06:12.601 --> 01:06:16.171
Association. You know,
Tourette's is a neuropsychiatric

01:06:16.203 --> 01:06:19.874
disorder that 100,000 Americans
deal with all the time. Now

01:06:19.907 --> 01:06:22.143
these guys, they
just do this to relieve stress.

01:06:22.877 --> 01:06:25.179
Ain't that a motherfucker?

01:06:25.212 --> 01:06:27.382
Now you're
officially a member.

01:06:30.252 --> 01:06:34.322
Mr. Johnson, I'm
gonna need that back.

01:06:34.355 --> 01:06:37.092
Big black's my old reliable.

01:06:42.931 --> 01:06:46.268
Sorry everyone. Sorry.

01:07:20.368 --> 01:07:21.436
What the fuck you

01:07:21.469 --> 01:07:23.304
talking about you Mr.
Magoo looking motherfucker?

01:07:23.337 --> 01:07:24.572
Foul on 69!

01:07:24.605 --> 01:07:27.243
It's ok. Come on. Come on. It's
alright. It's alright. Come on.

01:07:35.583 --> 01:07:38.654
Hey Rich, I heard your wife's
hole is bigger. Good luck

01:07:38.686 --> 01:07:42.757
nailing it, fuck face. Air ball!

01:07:43.324 --> 01:07:46.828
Good luck you shit-head.

Shut up!

01:07:50.665 --> 01:07:51.766
Shit taco!

01:07:51.799 --> 01:07:53.801
Yo, asshole! Good luck!

01:07:53.835 --> 01:07:55.704

01:08:01.909 --> 01:08:04.679
Shut up! Time!

01:08:06.714 --> 01:08:08.516
That's crazy. I don't see how

01:08:08.549 --> 01:08:11.519
this is so therapeutic. These
people are totally insane.

01:08:11.552 --> 01:08:12.788
They're just
cussing all the time.

01:08:12.821 --> 01:08:13.855
Ah man, just take it easy man.

01:08:13.888 --> 01:08:16.657
Drink up. You'll feel better.

01:08:16.691 --> 01:08:17.559
Thank you.

01:08:17.591 --> 01:08:19.761
Yeah, yeah.
You got it, man. Go ahead.

01:08:19.794 --> 01:08:21.863
Don't make it hard
on yourself out there.

01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:37.812
Boner!

01:08:44.551 --> 01:08:47.755
That's for the
steak dinner, jackass!

01:08:53.727 --> 01:08:56.397
What'd you,
do feel a breeze?

01:08:58.633 --> 01:09:00.368
Alright.
Roseanne Bar naked.

01:09:00.401 --> 01:09:02.703
Donald and
Melania Trump doggy style.

01:09:02.736 --> 01:09:05.339
No! It's not going away.
I'm gonna miss my flight!

01:09:05.372 --> 01:09:08.777
Roseanne Bar

01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:11.513
It's not working.
I'm gonna miss my flight!

01:09:11.545 --> 01:09:14.782
Down, boy. Just

01:09:14.816 --> 01:09:16.018
No! It's not working!

01:09:16.752 --> 01:09:20.721
Burnt popcorn. Wilfred Brimley.
That old guy that says diabetes.

01:09:20.754 --> 01:09:22.923
No! It's not working!

01:09:22.956 --> 01:09:25.459
Ok, think of my
mom. No, no, no. Think of your

01:09:25.493 --> 01:09:27.562
mom. Think of your mom. Not my
mom. Stop thinking about my mom.

01:09:27.594 --> 01:09:28.828
No! It's not working!

01:09:28.862 --> 01:09:33.667
Some hairy ass titties. Think
of eating Mr. T's ass, like arg!

01:09:33.701 --> 01:09:35.736
Get that shit
out of here, man.

01:09:35.770 --> 01:09:38.040
Hard. Think about it harder.
You're not thinking about it enough.

01:09:38.072 --> 01:09:40.042
Ok, wait, wait, wait,
wait. Ok, I got it.

01:09:40.075 --> 01:09:41.443
I'm gonna miss my flight.

01:09:41.475 --> 01:09:43.078
I've got it.
This is an emergency.

01:09:43.111 --> 01:09:46.982
Ah, ah, put
it away. Put it away!

01:09:47.014 --> 01:09:48.850
Back up. Back up.

01:09:48.883 --> 01:09:49.850
Do it.

01:09:49.883 --> 01:09:51.386
Voila!

01:09:55.423 --> 01:09:57.760
If
that don't do it, nothing will.

01:09:58.927 --> 01:10:01.362
It's getting bigger!

01:10:03.431 --> 01:10:06.868
Oh man,
we're not gonna make it.

01:10:06.901 --> 01:10:08.670
Don't worry.
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

01:10:08.703 --> 01:10:10.638
My friend is gonna get you
through, ok?

01:10:11.138 --> 01:10:13.308
Thank you.
Have a good flight.

01:10:15.142 --> 01:10:17.945
This is Alex. He's gonna
get us through security.

01:10:17.978 --> 01:10:20.981
Big dick!
Shit. Shit. Shit stain, shiatsu.

01:10:21.014 --> 01:10:23.584
Hey, come on. It's really no
time for that, ok? Just chill.

01:10:23.618 --> 01:10:25.020
You know what, my bad. I
should have mentioned.

01:10:25.053 --> 01:10:26.121
He actually does have
Tourette's.

01:10:26.154 --> 01:10:30.525
Boner! Boner! Boner! Boner!
Bomb! Bomb! Bomb! Bomb!

01:10:30.557 --> 01:10:32.093
Hey, don't say that word. Don't

01:12:06.754 --> 01:12:09.658
Thank you.

01:12:18.866 --> 01:12:20.668
Yo, taxi!

01:12:28.008 --> 01:12:30.078
Boner boy!

Hey, hey.
Surprise! Surprise!

01:12:40.053 --> 01:12:44.959
Uh, this my brother is
your going away party.

01:12:44.993 --> 01:12:47.928
But, unfortunately, it looks
like Smegman is gonna enforce

01:12:47.962 --> 01:12:49.763
your permanent
suspension from the WBL.

01:12:49.797 --> 01:12:51.500
Yeah, well
that doesn't surprise me.

01:12:51.532 --> 01:12:55.035
Yeah so we
figured yo, let's have some fun.

01:12:55.069 --> 01:12:58.106
Let's let it hang on out. So we
got some hookers in the back for

01:12:58.138 --> 01:13:01.176
you. Ok? Just giving you shit

01:13:01.209 --> 01:13:03.745
man, listen everybody. Please,

01:13:03.777 --> 01:13:06.714
raise your glasses for my
brother from another mother,

01:13:06.748 --> 01:13:11.620
pretty Richie.
Yeah, right on. L'Chaim.

01:13:15.557 --> 01:13:19.060
Yeah man. You know man,

01:13:19.093 --> 01:13:21.129
you're a lot like me.

01:13:21.161 --> 01:13:22.864
Tall, dark and handsome?

01:13:22.896 --> 01:13:24.231
Ah, you wish. You wish.

01:13:24.264 --> 01:13:28.637
No man um, you know like you I

01:13:28.669 --> 01:13:30.070
put a lot of work in this game

01:13:30.103 --> 01:13:32.039
man. Thinking that every win is

01:13:32.072 --> 01:13:34.241
gonna count and every
championship is gonna count and

01:13:34.275 --> 01:13:35.944
people are gonna love me. You

01:13:35.977 --> 01:13:39.114
know, I thought I was gonna have
family there forever. But I came

01:13:39.146 --> 01:13:43.117
back for good and man I realized

01:13:43.151 --> 01:13:47.255
shit, I don't know my wife
anymore. You know? My kids they

01:13:47.288 --> 01:13:51.293
grew up without me. I don't
wanna get sentimental and all

01:13:51.325 --> 01:13:53.227
that but don't end up like me.

01:13:53.261 --> 01:13:55.830
Alright, you still got a chance
to make it right with your

01:13:55.862 --> 01:13:59.301
family. Alright? Alright.
Do the right thing, baby.

01:14:02.770 --> 01:14:05.139
I'm so sorry
I was so hard on you.

01:14:05.173 --> 01:14:07.976
Mobile. That's ok.

01:14:08.008 --> 01:14:12.746
You're gonna be my dick
all the time alright, man? I'm

01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:13.915
actually gonna miss you bro.

01:14:13.947 --> 01:14:15.049
I'm gonna miss you too.

01:14:15.083 --> 01:14:17.118
Got any last requests?

01:14:17.151 --> 01:14:20.722
Last requests? Hm.

01:14:20.754 --> 01:14:22.757
From Ballz, any last requests?

01:14:22.789 --> 01:14:25.726
Narcoleptic Nick? Yeah actually,

01:14:25.759 --> 01:14:30.364
last request is, I want to know
how Mattress Mike got his name.

01:14:37.137 --> 01:14:41.642
Ok, ok, ok, ok, ok,
ok, ok. This happened like 2

01:14:41.676 --> 01:14:43.678
years ago? Like

01:14:43.710 --> 01:14:46.748
in Lubbock, Texas. Mike wasn't

01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:48.682
answering his phone.

01:14:48.715 --> 01:14:50.884
And he's late for the game.

01:14:50.918 --> 01:14:55.089
So me, Ballz and Cari go to his
room.

01:15:03.097 --> 01:15:06.101
It's not what

01:15:06.133 --> 01:15:10.338
it appears.

01:15:19.813 --> 01:15:21.749
Motor? Motor oil?

01:15:21.782 --> 01:15:24.052
And that's why they
call him Mattress Mike!

01:15:24.084 --> 01:15:25.319
Motor oil?

01:15:25.352 --> 01:15:27.722
For maximum viscosity.

01:15:29.190 --> 01:15:33.728
He's nasty, man.
Dick in mattress.

01:15:36.364 --> 01:15:39.067
Oh shit, what is that?

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa,

Aw, this is cute.
This is real cute.

01:16:42.096 --> 01:16:44.433
I got some

What are you waiting for?

You can't play no ball and
you're a bunch of pussies!

01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:15.763
I wouldn't mind
pretending to be walked over.

01:17:32.079 --> 01:17:33.749
My turn, ball sack.

01:17:35.816 --> 01:17:38.285
Meet the podiatrist!

01:17:38.319 --> 01:17:40.922
Bacon time!

What is your purpose? What is
your purpose? You a grown ass

man in a polar bear suit?

01:17:51.097 --> 01:17:53.834
Yes! We're number 1!

01:17:53.868 --> 01:17:58.139
Yeah! Whooh!

01:17:58.973 --> 01:18:02.476
You know, I
mean, amongst other things,

01:18:02.509 --> 01:18:04.545
I don't know why she
wasn't feeling me. I mean

01:18:04.579 --> 01:18:05.947
Yeah, right.

01:18:11.218 --> 01:18:15.088
Skinny girls
overrated. Bigbootygirls.com

01:18:15.121 --> 01:18:19.194
Oh, hey. I'm
sorry about game 7, you know?

01:18:19.227 --> 01:18:20.462
It's just a game.

01:18:20.495 --> 01:18:25.200
Yeah, I guess. But it is a game
that I will never play again.

01:18:25.232 --> 01:18:27.000
Look, just
cause you don't play for the

01:18:27.034 --> 01:18:29.170
Royals don't mean you
can't still play basketball.

01:18:29.203 --> 01:18:31.371
Hey, I
was just trying to help.

01:18:31.405 --> 01:18:35.375
Cari, I love
those pants on you.

01:18:35.409 --> 01:18:39.580
Thanks for noticing. Ever
since I stopped wearing

01:18:39.614 --> 01:18:43.317
underwear, it made all the
difference. No panty line, you

01:18:43.351 --> 01:18:46.554
know? Hey fellas, I'll have this
started in a minute. I'm gonna

01:18:46.587 --> 01:18:48.923
do a little hand job
on it right quick. Ok?

01:18:48.955 --> 01:18:51.959
Aw man, that's nasty and wrong.

01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:25.426
Hey kid. You like cookies?

01:19:25.459 --> 01:19:28.096
Stranger danger!
Stranger danger!

01:19:28.129 --> 01:19:29.964
Easy, alright? I'm here to help.

01:19:29.996 --> 01:19:32.167
How can you help me?

01:19:42.410 --> 01:19:45.179
My old man made me take like

01:19:45.212 --> 01:19:49.551
3,000 shots in the pouring rain.

01:19:50.285 --> 01:19:53.354
Well I didn't
have anybody to help me.

01:19:53.387 --> 01:19:57.692
Well you do
now. Come on, let's see it.

01:19:57.725 --> 01:19:59.895
Cookies in the cookie jar, yes!

01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:08.402
Hey, fellas. Over there.

01:20:08.436 --> 01:20:10.505
What up, Ballz?

01:20:13.708 --> 01:20:16.044
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, no,

01:20:16.076 --> 01:20:20.714
no, no, whooh! Yes. Ok, come on.

01:20:20.748 --> 01:20:25.020
Ready? Here we go. Yeah. I'm on
you. I'm on you. What you got?

01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:29.724
I'm glad he
didn't swat that shit.

01:20:29.757 --> 01:20:31.493
He shoots better than Mike.

01:20:41.002 --> 01:20:43.103
I want you to
check something out.

01:20:43.137 --> 01:20:44.706
What if that's his kid?

01:20:46.106 --> 01:20:49.343
He's coming
down the lane. He's driving.

01:20:49.377 --> 01:20:54.382
Ooh yeah! Two points.
That's what I'm talking about.

01:20:54.914 --> 01:20:57.118
What do you
say, Smegman? Come on, man.

01:20:57.151 --> 01:21:00.155
Too little too late.

01:21:03.223 --> 01:21:07.061
Ah man, I gotta get going,
but you keep practicing, ok?

01:21:15.302 --> 01:21:19.773
Uh, here. For you.

01:21:19.807 --> 01:21:21.309
Thanks.

01:21:21.342 --> 01:21:23.411
Keep practicing, ok?

01:21:28.214 --> 01:21:31.151
We are live.
Courtside at the World Basketball League

01:21:31.185 --> 01:21:34.554
Championship Game 7, which is
moments away, and we have just

01:21:34.588 --> 01:21:39.259
been handed the news. The WBL
has suspended Rich Johnson

01:21:39.293 --> 01:21:43.330
permanently and
deservedly so, I might add.

01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:46.066
You know what?
Screw you, Joe.

01:21:46.534 --> 01:21:48.636
Go fuck yourself with that suit.

01:21:48.669 --> 01:21:50.638
Go ahead, finish your
monkey show. Go ahead.

01:21:50.670 --> 01:21:53.540
Apparently the
apple apparently

01:21:53.574 --> 01:21:55.643
the apple doesn't
fall too far from the tree.

01:21:57.511 --> 01:21:59.513
Mom? Grandpa?
Can we go home?

01:22:00.481 --> 01:22:01.715
Yeah, we can go home.

01:22:01.749 --> 01:22:03.684
Yeah, we can go. Get your stuff.

01:22:03.717 --> 01:22:05.052
Get your phone.

01:22:05.084 --> 01:22:08.789
Wait a minute,
ladies and gentleman. We seem to have a

01:22:08.822 --> 01:22:13.194
special guest descending from
the ceiling. It's a bird. It's a

01:22:13.227 --> 01:22:16.297
plane. It's Rich Johnson man!

01:22:17.197 --> 01:22:18.499
Jenny, it's me!

01:22:20.234 --> 01:22:24.739
Daddy! Mom, it's really him.
He's wearing Rich Johnson man!

01:22:41.554 --> 01:22:43.825
No, no, no. Don't. Just
wait. Someone get him down.

01:22:46.259 --> 01:22:47.494
No, no, no, no, no, no!

01:22:49.329 --> 01:22:50.764
Yep, I'm naked.

01:22:55.436 --> 01:22:57.072
That's why you manscape.

01:23:07.414 --> 01:23:12.386
Sorry, sorry. Hey, hey mom. How

01:23:12.419 --> 01:23:16.791
are you?
Jenna May. Mildred, hey.

01:23:20.761 --> 01:23:25.633
Aw, impressive? You're a chip
off the old Johnson. Good job.

01:23:27.401 --> 01:23:29.737
Daddy, I knew you'd make it.

01:23:29.770 --> 01:23:30.603
Thank you.

01:23:30.637 --> 01:23:32.472
I just wish your
underwear had made it.

01:23:32.505 --> 01:23:36.643
Guys, I'm so sorry
I missed CostumeCon.

01:23:36.677 --> 01:23:38.379
I'm so sorry for

01:23:38.411 --> 01:23:40.847
everything. I'm really gonna try
and be a better father. Come

01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:43.484
here. Love you guys.

01:23:43.517 --> 01:23:48.289
What
is it, baby? What's going on?

01:23:48.955 --> 01:23:52.759
Nothing. I think you're
about to go viral again.

01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:02.522
Jerry O'Connell, show the face.

01:26:03.190 --> 01:26:05.726
I want to tell you that your

01:26:05.758 --> 01:26:08.928
professionalism just got in the
way of what could've been a

01:26:08.962 --> 01:26:13.301
great moment. When I flashed my
natural born, black breasts in

01:26:13.334 --> 01:26:16.704
your face, you didn't even break
character or the reaction that I

01:26:16.736 --> 01:26:19.673
was banking on that I would get
today and I'm not sure I want to

01:26:19.706 --> 01:26:22.810
work with you anymore. Do you
know how many motherfuckers want

01:26:22.843 --> 01:26:26.313
me to shake my natural
born, titties in they goddamn

01:26:26.347 --> 01:26:29.650
face? You need to slide into my
DM's and see who the fuck I am.

01:26:29.682 --> 01:26:31.851
But that's ok. It's
called acting. You could've

01:26:31.884 --> 01:26:34.922
act surprised. Cut,
fuck. I'm tired of talking.

01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:43.630
Wow, that's
real shit right there.
