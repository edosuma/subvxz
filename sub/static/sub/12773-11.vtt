you walking in here that way.

00:16.821 --> 00:18.253
Well, I can't keep running.

00:18.322 --> 00:20.856

00:20.924 --> 00:24.392

here for fugitives?

00:24.461 --> 00:26.327
My client--
he still has questions.

00:26.396 --> 00:28.597
Come on, Braxton,
who is this guy?

00:28.665 --> 00:30.198
What does he want from me?

00:30.266 --> 00:33.001
My job is to find out

00:33.069 --> 00:36.670
what kind of beast
you really are.

00:36.739 --> 00:39.740
Vincent's working undercover
for Homeland Security.

00:42.411 --> 00:45.212
Hi, I'm agent Olivia Dylan.

00:45.280 --> 00:47.347
But I'm not about to let
innocent people die

00:47.416 --> 00:48.949
just to protect my identity.

00:49.018 --> 00:51.218
Nor will we let you use Vincent
to do whatever else

00:51.286 --> 00:52.719
you wanted him to do.

00:52.787 --> 00:56.022
I didn't want Vincent
to <i>do</i> something.

00:56.090 --> 00:58.558
I wanted him to stop something.

00:58.627 --> 01:02.395
Something only
a beast can stop.

01:02.463 --> 01:05.431
Please don't tell me
there's another beast out there.

01:05.500 --> 01:08.267
Are you sure
that this is Braxton?

01:08.336 --> 01:09.902

01:09.970 --> 01:12.404

another beast on our hands.

Hey, Hugh Jass got us a six-pack on

01:42.468 --> 01:43.945

01:43.969 --> 01:45.268

By running away.
That's what evade means.

01:47.405 --> 01:49.573
I know what it means.
I spent ten years

01:49.641 --> 01:52.475
sleeping in abandoned buildings
to keep you safe, remember?

01:52.544 --> 01:54.184
Like it was yesterday.
And that was before

01:54.212 --> 01:56.312
traffic cameras,
drones and social media.

01:56.381 --> 01:59.616
Creating a fake identity today
is almost impossible.

01:59.685 --> 02:01.327
You'll be on the run,
looking over your shoulder

02:01.351 --> 02:03.852

02:03.921 --> 02:06.154
I can't believe Cat
is on board with this idea.

02:06.223 --> 02:09.959
Actually, she doesn't even know
I'm talking to you.

02:10.026 --> 02:12.027
Come on, don't
give me that look.

02:12.096 --> 02:14.630
Of course I would never
leave without her, but...

02:14.699 --> 02:17.932
we're meeting today
to discuss our options.

02:18.001 --> 02:19.834
JT,

02:19.903 --> 02:22.136
Braxton-- he forced me
to either kill innocent people

02:22.205 --> 02:24.706
or risk complete exposure, okay?

02:24.774 --> 02:26.674
I won't be backed
into a corner again.

02:26.743 --> 02:28.710
And you made the right decision,
but now it's only

02:28.778 --> 02:30.311
a matter of time before DHS

02:30.379 --> 02:33.147
finds Braxton's video
of you beasting out.

02:33.216 --> 02:34.859
Which is gonna close the window
on any chance

02:34.883 --> 02:37.484

in the world. Ever.

02:39.292 --> 02:42.759
So are you gonna help us
or what?

02:42.828 --> 02:45.829
Fine, you have
one really bad option.

02:45.898 --> 02:48.399
But in case you forgot,
there's another beast out there.

02:48.468 --> 02:50.534
Running away
isn't gonna solve that.

02:50.603 --> 02:54.237
Well, tell that to Braxton.

03:00.578 --> 03:02.045

03:02.114 --> 03:03.754
a mixing bowl, because
I have issues, too.

03:03.781 --> 03:05.781
Okay, deciding
whether to move in

03:05.850 --> 03:07.550
with your boyfriend
is not an issue,

03:07.619 --> 03:10.452
Heather. And I made
these muffins for Tess.

03:10.521 --> 03:13.455
To apologize for stealing
evidence and lying to her face?

03:13.524 --> 03:15.924
I also wrote her
a heartfelt card.

03:15.993 --> 03:17.526
Oh.
Look, Tess chose

03:17.594 --> 03:19.728
law and order,
and I chose Vincent.

03:19.796 --> 03:22.097
But now that Braxton's
been killed by a new beast...

03:22.166 --> 03:23.965
Wait, what?

03:24.035 --> 03:27.935
God, I really thought
Vincent was the only beast left.

03:28.004 --> 03:31.439
As scary as it is, this new
beast is also an opportunity.

03:31.508 --> 03:32.873
If Vincent
and I can

03:32.942 --> 03:34.542
bring him in just like
we did with Liam,

03:34.610 --> 03:36.110
then maybe we can make a deal

03:36.179 --> 03:37.445
with DHS to exonerate Vincent.

09:15.092 --> 09:18.194
If this doesn't work, you owe me
a lot more than muffins.

09:18.262 --> 09:20.196
Like, probably a new job.

09:29.606 --> 09:32.807
Oh, my God, what a surprise.

09:32.875 --> 09:34.442
Roses.
Actually, the name's Kyle.

09:34.511 --> 09:37.262
The guy who asked you
to move in with him, remember?

09:37.264 --> 09:38.591
And I still haven't
given you an answer yet.

09:38.615 --> 09:41.916
I am so sorry. Things have been
really crazy with my sister.

09:41.984 --> 09:43.095
Well, that's not a surprise.

09:43.119 --> 09:45.253
Heather, we really need to talk.

09:45.322 --> 09:46.786
I'm worried about you.

09:46.855 --> 09:48.533
Whatever you're involved
in, it feels a lot

09:48.557 --> 09:50.557
bigger than family drama.
You could say that.

09:50.626 --> 09:51.758
Just talk to me.

09:51.827 --> 09:53.327
Kyle, you know, I wish I could,

09:53.395 --> 09:54.894
but I have to go meet...

09:54.963 --> 09:56.230
someone to do...

09:56.298 --> 09:58.131
Let me guess-- something?

09:58.200 --> 09:59.666
I'm sorry.

09:59.735 --> 10:01.768
But I promise I will
come meet you after work

10:01.837 --> 10:04.002
and tell you
an answer then, okay?

10:04.071 --> 10:05.238
Okay.

10:08.209 --> 10:10.142
Thank you.

10:15.883 --> 10:18.251
Agent Dylan.
It's Kyle.

10:20.254 --> 10:22.186
Apparently Cat and Vincent
are still in the city.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.658
I don't know what to say.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.960
Garrus has to think
that Ecklund is texting him.

10:29.028 --> 10:30.795
How do billionaires
talk to each other?

10:30.864 --> 10:33.665
I don't know. Try using a lot
of dollar sign emojis.

10:33.734 --> 10:36.100
Fine, I'll keep it
short and urgent.

10:36.169 --> 10:38.435
"We need to talk in person.

10:38.504 --> 10:41.438
Now."
(text whooshes)

10:41.507 --> 10:44.107
Guess I'm not good at pretending
to be someone else.

10:44.176 --> 10:46.710
We're gonna be doing a lot
of that if we decide to run.

10:49.515 --> 10:52.516
You know what, remind me to tell
JT to make us filthy rich, okay?

10:52.585 --> 10:54.984
Yeah, but all the money in
the world didn't save Ecklund.

10:55.052 --> 10:57.186
He died
looking over his shoulder.

10:57.255 --> 10:59.032
Look, I don't want to run
either, but if that tape

10:59.056 --> 11:01.223
is released...
Then we don't have a choice.

11:01.293 --> 11:03.660
I know. We lose our city,
we lose our friends.

11:03.728 --> 11:05.662
Everything that makes us <i>us.</i>

11:05.730 --> 11:07.664
We won't lose that.
Come on.

11:10.201 --> 11:11.633
(phone dings)

11:14.871 --> 11:17.138
"4:30, Pier Side Market.

11:17.207 --> 11:18.407
Need to stay safe."

11:18.475 --> 11:19.708
Yeah. Sounds
like Garrus

11:19.777 --> 11:22.544
is looking over
his shoulder, too.

11:26.483 --> 11:28.849
Hey.
Hey.

11:31.554 --> 11:33.053
Okay, I have

11:33.122 --> 11:35.222
a double shot latte...

11:35.291 --> 11:36.857
Hey, thanks.

11:36.926 --> 11:39.660
...a family photo album
and Cat's high school yearbook

11:39.729 --> 11:41.094
from when
she was a sophomore.

11:41.163 --> 11:43.731
Full disclosure,
that was her awkward year.

11:43.800 --> 11:47.233
I'm sure Cat
was always beautiful.

11:47.302 --> 11:48.735
Wow. Girl mullet.

11:48.804 --> 11:52.205
Yeah. So you're
obviously not making

11:52.273 --> 11:54.240
a Cat and Vincent scrapbook.
What do old photos

11:54.309 --> 11:56.075
have to do with
catching this new beast?

11:56.144 --> 11:58.945
Nothing.
Cat and Vincent are...

11:59.013 --> 12:00.447
weighing their options.

12:00.515 --> 12:01.614
Well, what does that mean?

12:01.683 --> 12:03.059
It means you and I
are doing nothing.

12:03.083 --> 12:04.416
What?

12:04.485 --> 12:06.385
Wait, you're not even gonna try?

12:06.454 --> 12:07.964
God, JT, I for one
am tired of beasts, okay?

12:07.988 --> 12:09.688
I'm tired of us
putting our lives on hold.

12:09.757 --> 12:11.935
Is it too much to ask for
Vincent and Cat just to be safe?

12:11.959 --> 12:13.239
I think somebody should at least

12:13.293 --> 12:14.893
put a stop to this
once and for all.

12:14.962 --> 12:16.628
Great idea, why didn't
I think of that?

12:16.697 --> 12:18.464
Oh, wait, I did.

12:18.532 --> 12:19.964
14 years of my life,

12:20.032 --> 12:23.067
my career, my relationship
with Tess, tenure.

12:23.135 --> 12:24.869
I gave it all up
because I thought

12:24.937 --> 12:26.816
keeping my friends safe
was what I was meant to do.

12:26.840 --> 12:30.307
And now, all I can do
is buy airline tickets,

12:30.377 --> 12:32.543
forge passports,
and create new identities

12:32.612 --> 12:34.452
so that my best friends
could run away forever.

12:34.481 --> 12:36.480
How do you think
that makes me feel?

12:36.548 --> 12:38.214
Wait, I'm sorry,
did you just say that

12:38.283 --> 12:39.916
Vincent and Cat
are running away forever?

12:44.790 --> 12:47.056
Nice flowers.
They from Kyle?

12:49.160 --> 12:51.928
(indistinct conversations)

12:51.997 --> 12:54.463
CATHERINE: Interesting choice
for a safe place to meet.

12:54.532 --> 12:56.465
Public market's pretty open.

12:56.534 --> 12:58.066
Yeah, well, it makes sense

12:58.135 --> 13:01.069
if a beast attack is
what you're afraid of.

13:02.139 --> 13:05.474
Garrus knows about beasts.

13:05.543 --> 13:08.310
And if this new one shows up,
I want to see him coming.

13:08.379 --> 13:10.745
Keep your eyes open.
I'm sending the text now.

13:15.385 --> 13:18.319
(phone chimes)

13:18.388 --> 13:20.622
Okay, I got him. Gray cap.
He's coming your way.

13:21.558 --> 13:23.792
Yeah. Yeah, I see him.

13:23.860 --> 13:25.192
Dr. Garrus.

13:25.261 --> 13:26.961
Catherine Chandler.
Do you have a minute?

13:27.030 --> 13:28.862
I'm sorry. I'm meeting somebody.
Yes, I know.

13:28.931 --> 13:30.163
Lars Ecklund.

13:31.834 --> 13:33.133
He won't be able to make it.

13:33.201 --> 13:34.701
Who are you?

13:34.770 --> 13:36.970
Catherine Chandler.
I work with the NYPD.

13:37.039 --> 13:39.606
Ecklund is dead.

13:39.675 --> 13:42.443
And if you know anything about
Muirfield, you may be in danger.

13:42.511 --> 13:43.722
I don't know
what you're talking about.

13:43.746 --> 13:46.679
(beeping)

13:46.748 --> 13:48.981
It's here. It's found me.

13:49.050 --> 13:51.884
(high-pitched ringing)
(groaning)

13:52.921 --> 13:53.931
Vincent, what's happening?

13:53.955 --> 13:55.154
Hey!
Come on!

13:55.222 --> 13:56.222
Go, go! Go after him!

14:00.462 --> 14:01.560
MAN:
Hey!

14:01.628 --> 14:02.327
(ringing stops)

14:02.395 --> 14:04.496
(panting)

14:04.565 --> 14:06.832
Wait! We're trying to help!

14:15.075 --> 14:18.309
Stop. There's
too many people around.

14:18.378 --> 14:20.310
What the hell just happened?

14:20.379 --> 14:22.880
I don't know. But
he dropped this.

14:22.949 --> 14:25.215
Pretty sure it's some kind
of sensing device with

14:25.284 --> 14:28.151
a high-pitched frequency that
brought me to my damn knees.

14:28.220 --> 14:30.488
Pretty sure this guy knows
a beast is after him.

14:30.556 --> 14:32.490
Yeah, but now he thinks
you're the beast.

14:39.217 --> 14:41.450
(horns honking)

14:41.519 --> 14:44.020
How did Garrus get away?
You're a beast.

14:44.089 --> 14:46.322
Actually, that's the
reason he got away.

14:46.391 --> 14:48.691
Garrus knew a beast was
after him. He had sensors

14:48.760 --> 14:50.525
and a weaponized alarm.

14:50.594 --> 14:52.794
(sighs) We're gonna have
to get JT onto this thing.

14:52.863 --> 14:54.997
Track him down
and get some answers fast.

14:55.065 --> 14:56.564
Well, I'd like
some answers, too.

14:56.633 --> 14:58.867
When were you guys
planning on telling me

14:58.936 --> 15:01.503
you're forging passports and planning on
running away forever?

15:01.571 --> 15:02.749
Wait, you guys are running away?

15:02.773 --> 15:04.072
I can explain.
Can you?

15:04.141 --> 15:06.308
Because you promised
to aid a lawful investigation,

15:06.377 --> 15:09.210
not use me to track down the
new beast and then cut and run.

15:09.279 --> 15:11.312
Since when are you two
going after the new beast?

15:11.381 --> 15:13.414
Vincent acted like that
was a tomorrow problem.

15:13.482 --> 15:17.051
Yeah. To be fair, it-it seemed
like it happened yesterday.

15:17.120 --> 15:18.552
Look, we didn't lie
to any of you.

15:18.621 --> 15:20.032
Vincent and I have two plans,
and we haven't

15:20.056 --> 15:21.422
decided on either of them yet.

15:21.490 --> 15:22.902
Either we're gonna go
after the new beast

15:22.926 --> 15:25.591
and make a deal
with DHS or...

15:25.660 --> 15:27.027
Vincent's thing.

15:27.095 --> 15:28.929
My thing?
Yeah, although your plan "A"

15:28.997 --> 15:31.075
isn't really working out either,
now that our only lead

15:31.099 --> 15:33.199
has taken off in a freakin' speedboat.
Well,

15:33.268 --> 15:36.769
we can't leave without new identities.
Okay. I'm almost there.

15:36.838 --> 15:38.704
Except, due
to heightened airport security,

15:38.773 --> 15:42.707
fake identities aren't reliable,
so we need to find actual people

15:42.776 --> 15:46.711
who are preferably...
recently deceased. No biggie.

15:46.780 --> 15:49.481
CATHERINE: Well, there goes plan "B."
Yeah, so all we need now

15:49.550 --> 15:52.517
is for DHS to find that tape of
me and we're out of all options.

15:52.586 --> 15:54.719
So why are we even arguing?
We're arguing

15:54.788 --> 15:57.122
because I'm about
to lose my sister forever.

16:04.497 --> 16:05.930
(indistinct chatter)

16:05.999 --> 16:07.598
Heath! Hey, wait!

16:07.667 --> 16:11.235
Look, whatever happens,
it's gonna be okay.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.204
How? Cat, you and Vincent

16:13.273 --> 16:15.372
fight this new beast,
chances are I lose you.

16:15.441 --> 16:17.207
You and Vincent run away,
I lose you.

16:17.276 --> 16:19.876
Or DHS finds that video
of Vincent and carts him off

16:19.945 --> 16:22.045
to Area 51, and then what?
I lose you.

16:22.114 --> 16:24.481
Wow, Mom was right.
You should have been a lawyer.

16:24.549 --> 16:25.983
Cat...
Okay,

16:26.051 --> 16:27.884
if Vincent and I have
to leave...

16:27.953 --> 16:29.886
But Vincent can go without you.

16:29.955 --> 16:31.121
You know that he can't.

16:31.190 --> 16:32.588
And I can't stay
without him.

16:32.656 --> 16:34.490
Whatever we do,
we do it together.

16:34.558 --> 16:37.326
Just...
I've already lost so much

16:37.395 --> 16:38.995
because of this beast thing,
Cat.

16:39.063 --> 16:41.430
And not just finding
a job or...

16:41.499 --> 16:43.499
or moving in with Kyle, but...

16:43.567 --> 16:46.335
I mean, we lost Mom.

16:46.404 --> 16:48.770
And Dad.
And I really don't want to have

16:48.839 --> 16:50.505
to lose you, too.
You're right.

16:50.573 --> 16:53.508
You shouldn't have to give up
any more of your life

16:53.576 --> 16:55.010
for Vincent and me.

16:55.078 --> 16:57.112
This isn't your fight--
it's ours.

16:57.180 --> 16:58.946
But I'm a part of it.

16:59.016 --> 17:02.317
Cat, I'm your sister.
I'm supposed to protect you.

17:02.386 --> 17:05.453
I'm your big sister.
I'm supposed to protect <i>you.</i>

17:05.521 --> 17:07.021
Heath,

17:07.089 --> 17:09.022
I want you to be happy.

17:09.090 --> 17:12.459
And if Vincent and I do have
to leave,

17:12.528 --> 17:15.194
just know that wherever I am,
I love you.

17:23.604 --> 17:25.637
You okay?

17:25.705 --> 17:28.407
Yeah. Yeah, you
know, it's just, uh,

17:28.476 --> 17:30.743
been a hell
of a day.

17:30.811 --> 17:33.679
Found out that Muirfield
isn't really gone after all.

17:33.748 --> 17:36.082
You know, this beast thing
is never gonna end.

17:36.151 --> 17:38.351
And if we do
have to run,

17:38.420 --> 17:41.553
I'm gonna break
Catherine's heart.

17:41.621 --> 17:43.655
And mine.

17:43.723 --> 17:44.265
(chuckles)

17:44.289 --> 17:46.289
Yeah, you mean you're
gonna miss Cat, right?

17:46.326 --> 17:48.693
'Cause you've never
really been one of my fans.

17:48.762 --> 17:52.597
I haven't been a fan
of breaking the law?

17:52.666 --> 17:56.368
Or putting my life and career
in jeopardy? No.

17:56.437 --> 17:58.769
But the way you love
my friend, the way you...

17:58.837 --> 18:01.372
the way you keep her safe...

18:01.441 --> 18:03.374
You're right.
I don't like the beast.

18:03.443 --> 18:05.008
But I will miss the man.

18:05.078 --> 18:08.512
Well played.

18:08.581 --> 18:12.183
(quietly): You know, JT was
crazy for ever letting you go.

18:12.251 --> 18:14.084
Thank you.

18:14.152 --> 18:17.353
But it's not like
I've gone very far. (chuckles)

18:19.524 --> 18:21.458
Beast hug?
No.

18:21.526 --> 18:23.093
Yes.
Vincent. Oh, God.

18:24.159 --> 18:25.413
Any sign of Garrus?

18:25.437 --> 18:26.964
None. Apparently
it's easier

18:26.965 --> 18:29.065
to disappear than I thought.
Okay, wait.

18:29.134 --> 18:31.733
How are we supposed to find
this guy, protect him,

18:31.802 --> 18:34.636
when he thinks he's protecting
himself from us?

18:34.705 --> 18:35.884
If Vincent goes
anywhere near Garrus, he'll run.

18:35.908 --> 18:38.940
Maybe we don't need Garrus.
H-He definitely knows enough

18:39.009 --> 18:41.876
about the new beast
to make a sensor and a weapon.

18:41.945 --> 18:43.712
If he knows more, it
could be in his lab.

18:43.780 --> 18:46.093
If we could get the names of
the people he experimented on,

18:46.117 --> 18:48.649
it could give us a lead on
the identity of the new beast.

18:48.718 --> 18:51.085
And if Muirfield 3.0 is starting
up again, I sure as hell

18:51.154 --> 18:51.922
would like to stop it.

18:51.946 --> 18:54.186
Hey, I'm all about putting
that genie back in the bottle,

18:54.491 --> 18:56.657
but Garrus is still
an important witness.

18:56.726 --> 18:59.660
Okay, well, while
JT is surveilling on Garrus,

18:59.729 --> 19:01.377
Catherine and I
can break into the lab.

19:01.401 --> 19:02.998
Uh, it might make

19:02.999 --> 19:04.965
more sense for Cat and
Tess to stay while you

19:05.034 --> 19:06.899
and I break into Garrus' lab.

19:06.968 --> 19:09.302
Uh, I'll have a better sense
of what we're looking at.

19:09.371 --> 19:11.304
Okay. Sounds like a plan.
Or it sounds like

19:11.373 --> 19:13.306
a chance for JT
to have one last cool mission

19:13.375 --> 19:14.574
with his best friend.

19:18.713 --> 19:20.813
♪ ♪

19:22.416 --> 19:23.749
(trilling)

19:23.817 --> 19:25.518
(beeping)

19:27.188 --> 19:29.288
You're loving
this, aren't you?

19:29.357 --> 19:32.291
Just a little.

19:32.360 --> 19:35.861
Come on, if this is our last
mission, it's a big deal.

19:35.929 --> 19:38.864
Breaking and entering,
risking our lives.

19:38.932 --> 19:41.699
You're the only friend I
have who I'd do this with.

19:41.768 --> 19:44.802
I'm the only friend you have, period.
I have

19:44.871 --> 19:46.955
other people. You just happen
to take a lot of my time.

19:46.979 --> 19:48.040
I know.

19:48.041 --> 19:50.375
Which is why, when
this is all over,

19:50.443 --> 19:53.378
you promise me you get back out
there, you get your life back,

19:53.446 --> 19:55.213
and,
most importantly,

19:55.282 --> 19:57.514
you get Tess back, okay?

19:57.583 --> 19:59.383
Enough nagging. You're
ruining the mission.

19:59.451 --> 20:00.585
Do you need some help?

20:00.609 --> 20:01.619
Maybe I'll just bust
this thing down.

20:01.620 --> 20:04.454
No. No, no, no, no. You
don't have to beast out.

20:04.523 --> 20:06.856
When you and Cat
are gone forever, I'm...

20:06.925 --> 20:09.125
gonna need to open my own doors.

20:11.530 --> 20:13.163
(trilling)

20:13.231 --> 20:15.364
(beeping)

20:15.433 --> 20:16.165
(click)

20:16.234 --> 20:17.833
Boom.

20:17.902 --> 20:20.536
(chuckles)

20:25.076 --> 20:27.743
We're gonna need
a bigger bottle.

20:27.812 --> 20:30.179
The DNA fragmentor,

20:30.247 --> 20:33.181
multiple PCRs, uh,

20:33.250 --> 20:36.184
a cellular printer.
Theoretically,

20:36.253 --> 20:39.321
you can print living
organisms on this thing.

20:39.389 --> 20:42.691
This is like
Muirfield on crack.

20:42.759 --> 20:45.527
Garrus has equipment I never
thought I'd see in my life.

20:45.596 --> 20:49.162
And he's got something
I hoped I would never see again.

20:49.232 --> 20:51.565
Braxton's beast cage.

20:51.634 --> 20:53.900
Catherine and Tess
better find Garrus,

20:53.969 --> 20:56.069
'cause we got a lot
to talk about.

20:58.507 --> 21:00.941
TESS:
I can't find Garrus anywhere.

21:01.009 --> 21:02.654
There's no surveillance
on the speedboat, and all

21:02.678 --> 21:04.877
of his registered vehicles
are already accounted for.

21:04.946 --> 21:07.258
The guy either disappeared,
or I'm just the worst detective.

21:07.282 --> 21:08.914
Okay, well, that isn't true.

21:08.983 --> 21:10.916
(sighs) Thank you.
Come on, Tess.

21:10.985 --> 21:14.587
We've solved hundreds
of these cases over the years.

21:14.656 --> 21:17.257
Remember Franco Vega?

21:17.325 --> 21:19.292
That drug kingpin
who changed cars

21:19.361 --> 21:20.893
more than he
changed shirts?

21:20.962 --> 21:23.962
Yeah, until we could figure out
how to track his phone.

21:24.030 --> 21:26.965
Cat, I don't have clearance.
Come on, Tess.

21:31.037 --> 21:33.972
You know, it would make
things a lot easier

21:34.040 --> 21:35.707
if you and I didn't
work so well together.

21:38.111 --> 21:40.645
If you and Vincent
have to leave...

21:40.713 --> 21:44.148
(exhales) I'm never gonna
find a better partner.

21:45.551 --> 21:48.986
I'm never gonna find
a better friend.

21:51.524 --> 21:54.124
TESS:
It's Garrus.

21:54.193 --> 21:55.825
Where is he?

21:55.894 --> 21:57.827
Closer than we thought.

21:57.896 --> 22:00.471
VINCENT: Wait, wait, hold up. What do
you mean by "super beasts," exactly?

22:00.472 --> 22:01.509
I mean, from what
you told me

22:01.533 --> 22:03.466
about the new beast
having camouflage

22:03.535 --> 22:05.902
and-and what I'm seeing here,

22:05.970 --> 22:08.237
these guys weren't
just replicating Muirfield--

22:08.307 --> 22:09.839
they were enhancing it.

22:09.908 --> 22:12.508
(phone rings)

22:12.576 --> 22:14.510
Hey. Look,

22:14.578 --> 22:16.912
I think we're in trouble here.
CATHERINE: I know.

22:16.980 --> 22:18.647
We found Garrus.
He's in the building.

22:21.185 --> 22:22.185
Vincent?

22:23.321 --> 22:24.321
Don't touch the doors!

22:24.355 --> 22:25.120
They're electrified.

22:25.189 --> 22:26.087
What's happening?!

22:26.156 --> 22:27.088
It's Garrus.

22:27.157 --> 22:28.324
(high-pitched ringing)

22:28.392 --> 22:29.824
(shouting)

22:36.566 --> 22:38.132
(ringing stops)

22:38.201 --> 22:41.202
(grunting)

22:41.270 --> 22:42.470
Stop! No!

22:42.539 --> 22:44.439
He's our only lead
to the new beast!

22:45.675 --> 22:48.342
(panting)

22:53.782 --> 22:55.014
You could have killed him.

22:55.083 --> 22:56.450
Oh, he'll live.

22:56.518 --> 22:59.219
More to the point, he'll talk.

23:07.559 --> 23:09.259
(bell chimes)

23:09.328 --> 23:10.660
(creaking)

23:10.729 --> 23:12.929
Dr. Garrus.

23:12.998 --> 23:14.598
Good morning.

23:14.666 --> 23:16.499
Where am I? Who are you people?

23:16.567 --> 23:18.234
NYPD. And friends.

23:20.804 --> 23:21.937
JT:
Relax.

23:22.006 --> 23:23.805
He's not the beast you're after.

23:23.874 --> 23:25.174
Checking for
concussion.

23:25.243 --> 23:29.411
Okay, you took a nasty bump
to the head.

23:29.480 --> 23:30.579
Eyes with me.

23:30.648 --> 23:32.148
The only reason I know

23:32.216 --> 23:35.082
is because I'm the one
who gave it to you.

23:36.919 --> 23:40.855
But you're a...
CATHERINE: Beast.

23:40.923 --> 23:42.011
That's what Muirfield
used to call them.

23:42.012 --> 23:45.194
Yeah. Unless you and your friends came up
with a catchier name, along with

23:45.262 --> 23:47.695
the other improvements
you were working on in the lab.

23:47.764 --> 23:49.375
TESS: Dr. Garrus, you're in danger.
And if we're going

23:49.399 --> 23:51.309
to protect you, we need you
to answer a few questions.

23:51.333 --> 23:54.701
No, you-you
can't protect me.

23:54.770 --> 23:57.337
You have no idea
what it's capable of.

23:57.406 --> 23:59.306
Okay, listen,
you can't protect yourself.

23:59.375 --> 24:02.442
Those stupid toys you have,
they couldn't even take me down,

24:02.511 --> 24:04.511
let alone
whatever's coming next.

24:04.580 --> 24:06.946
Look, face it, okay?

24:07.015 --> 24:09.448
I'm probably the only chance
you got right now.

24:13.221 --> 24:14.620
(siren wailing)

24:17.792 --> 24:21.294
Hey. I thought
we were meeting after my shift.

24:21.362 --> 24:23.296
Yeah, I know. But, um,

24:23.364 --> 24:26.198
I made my decision, and I
didn't want to wait any longer.

24:26.266 --> 24:27.299
Okay.

24:27.367 --> 24:28.533
(exhales)

24:28.602 --> 24:30.202
I want to move in with you.

24:30.270 --> 24:31.636
Really?
Yeah.

24:31.705 --> 24:34.706
You have no idea
how happy I am to hear that.

24:34.774 --> 24:36.040
Let me grab
my jacket,

24:36.109 --> 24:39.043
and we'll go celebrate.
Okay.

24:39.112 --> 24:42.379
Room 412. The couple was DOA.
House fire.

24:42.448 --> 24:45.683
I'll input the files, and then
you can get them to the morgue.

24:45.751 --> 24:47.518
(indistinct chatter)

24:51.657 --> 24:53.990
(exhales)

25:02.234 --> 25:03.433
Have you seen my girlfriend?

25:03.501 --> 25:04.701
Uh, no.

25:04.769 --> 25:07.069
Have you seen my files?

25:08.840 --> 25:10.540
GARRUS:
<i>Braxton knew</i>

25:10.609 --> 25:12.775
about Muirfield
from his days at the NSA.

25:12.844 --> 25:14.844
He said he had a client
from a foreign country

25:14.912 --> 25:17.846
that was interested
in one of Muirfield's assets.

25:17.914 --> 25:20.014
Turning humans
into killing machines.

25:20.083 --> 25:22.517
So Braxton asked Ecklund
to acquire Muirfield,

25:22.586 --> 25:23.667
and you identified
the formula?

25:23.668 --> 25:25.034
No, I improved it.

25:25.102 --> 25:26.769
The formula was flawed,
outdated.

25:26.838 --> 25:28.438
Braxton's client
wanted a weapon

25:28.506 --> 25:31.073
stronger than anything
that Muirfield had made.

25:31.142 --> 25:32.702
So that's when you added
the camouflage?

25:32.976 --> 25:35.309
Among other things.
They were armored,

25:35.314 --> 25:36.880
TESS:
What did the client need

25:36.949 --> 25:38.882
this super beast for?
There was some threat

25:38.951 --> 25:40.517
that only a weaponized
human could stop.

25:40.585 --> 25:44.520
Braxton's client traded
vital information

25:44.588 --> 25:46.455
to National Security
in exchange.

25:46.524 --> 25:48.124
So the State Department
approved this?

25:48.192 --> 25:50.459
Well, there wasn't time,
but then,

25:50.528 --> 25:52.395
when Braxton
delivered the prototype,

25:52.463 --> 25:54.863
the State Department
opened an investigation.

25:54.933 --> 25:57.233
Ecklund and I couldn't risk
that kind of exposure,

25:57.302 --> 25:59.935
so we agreed that Braxton had
to take the blame.

26:00.003 --> 26:02.737
Dr. Garrus, if we're
gonna find the beast

26:02.806 --> 26:05.473
that killed Braxton and Ecklund,
we're gonna need the names

26:05.542 --> 26:07.542
of the people that
you experimented on.

26:07.610 --> 26:11.479
The client supplied
and recruited all the subjects.

26:11.548 --> 26:13.248
I only knew them
by their lab numbers.

26:13.317 --> 26:14.983
Okay, what was the name
of the client?

26:15.052 --> 26:16.461
I don't know.
CATHERINE: What happened

26:16.485 --> 26:17.818
to the prototype you delivered?

26:17.886 --> 26:19.987
Braxton said
it had been destroyed,

26:20.056 --> 26:22.889
along with the other subjects.
Oh, Braxton was wrong, wasn't he?

26:22.959 --> 26:24.336
'Cause those subjects
were human beings,

26:24.360 --> 26:25.492
and they weren't destroyed.

26:25.561 --> 26:26.972
They were murdered
by you and your team

26:26.996 --> 26:28.895
to try and turn them into
some kind of monsters.

26:28.965 --> 26:30.664
And that prototype
that got away--

26:30.732 --> 26:33.433
"it," as you call him--

26:33.501 --> 26:35.768
is gonna seek revenge
on your corrupted ass.

26:35.837 --> 26:39.138
I made a mistake, a mistake,

26:39.207 --> 26:41.674
and I am truly, truly sorry.

26:41.742 --> 26:43.309
It's a little too late for that.

26:44.812 --> 26:47.146
You took away

26:47.215 --> 26:49.815
innocent people's
lives... Doctor.

26:55.222 --> 26:57.489
Vincent?
What?

26:57.557 --> 27:00.325
It's the same thing
over and over again, okay?

27:00.394 --> 27:01.948
We can't stop it this time.

27:01.949 --> 27:02.726
What do you mean?

27:02.750 --> 27:04.594
I mean, whatever
the hell they've created--

27:05.332 --> 27:07.298
it's stronger,
it's faster, it's smarter,

27:07.367 --> 27:08.774
it's freakin' invisible
for God's sake, okay?

27:08.775 --> 27:10.714
If it wants Garrus,
it's gonna get him.

27:10.715 --> 27:12.761
And you're fine with that?
Yeah, I'm fine with it, okay?

27:12.785 --> 27:14.564
Because he...
he is not an innocent.

27:14.588 --> 27:16.341
But you... you are.

27:16.342 --> 27:18.942
Vincent, you killed Hill in
self-defense, and the only way

27:19.012 --> 27:20.978
that we're gonna get
DHS to exonerate you is

27:21.047 --> 27:23.214
if we save Garrus and
bring in this new beast.

27:23.282 --> 27:25.048
All right, well, it
might be too late.

27:25.117 --> 27:27.150
I just got an urgent
text from Agent Dylan.

27:27.219 --> 27:28.562
DHS wants me to
come in right away.

27:28.586 --> 27:29.886
You think they saw the video?

27:29.954 --> 27:31.265
I don't know, but
it can't be good.

27:31.289 --> 27:33.890
JT hasn't even finished
the passports yet.

27:33.958 --> 27:36.226
Then we should bring
in the new beast now.

27:36.294 --> 27:38.694
Yeah, and talking to him
isn't gonna do much, is it?

27:38.763 --> 27:40.130
(growling)

27:40.198 --> 27:41.796
Vincent, no!
(Garrus yells)

27:43.200 --> 27:45.834
What are you doing?
I...

27:45.903 --> 27:49.471
am gonna use you... as bait.

27:57.672 --> 28:00.472
(beep, sighs)
JT programmed the beast alarm

28:00.541 --> 28:03.242
to exclude you, but it should
still sense the new beast.

28:03.311 --> 28:05.277
You sure that's enough blood
for him to track?

28:05.346 --> 28:07.012
Yeah, well, I would
have taken more,

28:07.081 --> 28:09.181
but Garrus was looking
a little woozy.

28:09.249 --> 28:10.781
Come on, you heard him.

28:10.850 --> 28:12.517
This super beast is
supposed to be able

28:12.586 --> 28:15.019
to do everything I can
do and a whole lot more.

28:15.088 --> 28:16.895
Yeah, that's not
exactly reassuring.

28:16.919 --> 28:17.823
Come on.

28:17.824 --> 28:19.984
We took down Liam, didn't we?
Yeah, but we've never had

28:20.026 --> 28:21.859
to face a beast that was
specifically designed

28:21.928 --> 28:23.428
to be better than you.

28:23.496 --> 28:25.963
Well...

28:26.032 --> 28:28.265
I know one thing

28:28.334 --> 28:30.800
that this beast
doesn't have that I do.

28:30.869 --> 28:32.168
Desperation?

28:32.238 --> 28:34.938
No. You.

28:37.543 --> 28:39.309
Come on. We're
gonna be fine, okay?

28:39.378 --> 28:41.878
This beast cage was built
specifically for him,

28:41.947 --> 28:44.146
the stun gun, the
alarm, everything.

28:44.215 --> 28:45.948
We're gonna be
absolutely fine.

28:46.016 --> 28:48.484
But what if Heather's right,
and we're pressing our luck?

28:48.553 --> 28:50.152
This could be
a suicide mission.

28:50.221 --> 28:52.555
Come on. We don't
have a choice.

28:52.624 --> 28:55.891
This is our last chance
at making a deal with DHS.

28:55.960 --> 28:59.495
You sure you don't want
one of these?

28:59.564 --> 29:01.630
Are you kidding?
I don't need that thing.

29:12.409 --> 29:14.049
DYLAN: I just found out
that Lars Ecklund,

29:14.110 --> 29:16.244
a client of Braxton's,
was murdered

29:16.313 --> 29:19.580
the same way Braxton was, and
that you withheld the report.

29:19.649 --> 29:21.582
I had reason
to believe that going public

29:21.651 --> 29:23.528
with Ecklund's murder would
compromise the investigation

29:23.552 --> 29:25.386
and put another life in danger.

29:25.454 --> 29:27.321
Whose life?
Albert Garrus?

29:27.390 --> 29:28.818
It's, um...
it's complicated.

29:28.819 --> 29:31.158
No. It's really very simple.
You appear to be going

29:31.226 --> 29:32.866
down the same path
as your former partner.

29:32.928 --> 29:34.727
Working outside the law,

29:34.796 --> 29:36.162
pursuing your own agenda,

29:36.230 --> 29:38.197
instead of bringing in
Vincent Keller.

29:38.266 --> 29:40.600
Look, I told you, there was
something bigger going on here.

29:40.669 --> 29:42.034
Whoever killed Braxton...

29:42.103 --> 29:44.771
Solving Braxton's murder
is not your job.

29:44.839 --> 29:46.572
Yes, it is! If I can
bring the murderer in,

29:46.641 --> 29:47.907
it'll explain everything.

29:47.975 --> 29:49.776
Braxton's relationship
with Keller,

29:49.844 --> 29:51.943
what really happened to
Deputy Secretary Hill.

29:52.012 --> 29:55.414
If we can find the truth, maybe
Keller will turn himself in.

29:55.482 --> 29:57.949
I just need you
to give me an hour, okay?

29:58.018 --> 29:59.951
Then we can both have
what we want.

30:01.288 --> 30:02.954
All right.

30:03.023 --> 30:04.753
You can have an hour.

30:04.753 --> 30:05.312
Thank you.

30:05.336 --> 30:07.358
But if you think explaining
Hill's murder is gonna lead

30:07.382 --> 30:09.560
to exoneration of Keller,
it's never gonna happen.

30:09.629 --> 30:10.928
What are you
talking about?

30:10.996 --> 30:12.896
If we have proof
that Vincent was acting

30:12.965 --> 30:14.865
out of self-defense,
then he's not a criminal.

30:14.934 --> 30:17.267
All right, off the record...

30:17.337 --> 30:19.737
I believe you.

30:19.806 --> 30:23.207
Vincent led DHS to Braxton,

30:23.275 --> 30:25.375
he saved the life
of that security guard

30:25.444 --> 30:27.644
in the Lewis case.

30:27.713 --> 30:30.213
But I've already run
exoneration up the flagpole,

30:30.281 --> 30:33.783
and the secretary of Homeland
Security was very clear.

30:33.852 --> 30:36.919
Vincent killed one of our own.

30:36.988 --> 30:39.456
There'll be no deal, no mercy.

30:39.524 --> 30:41.958
Not for him
or for anyone who protects him.

30:45.529 --> 30:48.731
So, that's all you've got?

30:48.799 --> 30:52.000
Just saying.
Tranq gun's pretty primitive.

30:52.069 --> 30:55.237
What don't you just use
a whip and a chair?

30:55.305 --> 30:56.972
Do you use that

30:57.040 --> 30:58.774
to control him?

30:58.843 --> 31:00.483
Vincent is my friend.
I don't control him.

31:00.543 --> 31:02.777
He could listen
to me more maybe.

31:02.846 --> 31:05.079
Where are Cat and Vincent?

31:05.147 --> 31:06.947
(panting)

31:07.016 --> 31:08.649
Who's he?

31:08.718 --> 31:10.685
Albert Garrus, new bad guy.

31:10.754 --> 31:14.021
Cat and Vincent are... busy.

31:14.090 --> 31:16.590
(phone buzzes)
Well... hey, they're fighting...

31:16.658 --> 31:18.191
the beast, aren't they?

31:18.260 --> 31:20.071
Tell them to get back here
so that they can go!

31:20.095 --> 31:21.961
Wait. Are these...?
Death certificates.

31:22.030 --> 31:24.598
I stole them from the hospital.
They haven't been entered

31:24.666 --> 31:26.867
into the system yet.
I know Cat told me

31:26.935 --> 31:29.146
that I shouldn't give up any
more of my life for beasts, but

31:29.170 --> 31:30.670
she's my sister.
If I can protect her,

31:30.739 --> 31:32.105
then this is my fight, too.

31:32.173 --> 31:33.339
Heather, this is amazing.

31:33.408 --> 31:34.673
You just did more

31:34.742 --> 31:38.377
to protect them
than I ever could.

31:41.348 --> 31:43.816
I'm gonna go.

31:43.885 --> 31:45.183
Oh, oh, whoa, whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!

31:45.252 --> 31:46.552
(Heather gasps)

31:46.621 --> 31:47.853
Oh, JT!

31:47.922 --> 31:49.054
(gasps)

31:49.123 --> 31:51.989
(rhythmic beeping)

31:52.058 --> 31:54.459
Looks like we
got company.

31:56.430 --> 31:58.996
(rapid beeping,
loud clack, power whirring down)

31:59.065 --> 32:00.799
Vincent, what's happening?
I don't know.

32:00.867 --> 32:02.634
Get to the cage! Go!

32:02.702 --> 32:04.335
(loud explosion, gasping)

32:04.404 --> 32:07.371
(explosion, Vincent coughing)

32:07.440 --> 32:09.573
(Catherine coughing,
electrical crackling)

32:09.642 --> 32:11.675
(both coughing)

32:11.744 --> 32:13.176
You okay?

32:13.245 --> 32:14.845
(coughing)
I will be.

32:14.914 --> 32:16.346
(electrical crackling)

32:16.415 --> 32:18.482
Why the hell would
a beast use a grenade?

32:18.551 --> 32:20.818
I don't know.
(coughing)

32:20.886 --> 32:23.386
Why did the attack stop?
Is he gone?

32:23.456 --> 32:25.187
I think so.

32:25.256 --> 32:28.057
I wasn't expecting
that, either.

32:28.125 --> 32:29.725
(Catherine coughs)

32:29.794 --> 32:31.954
Something is definitely
not right here. (phone ringing)

32:31.996 --> 32:34.330
Tess, what's going on?

32:34.398 --> 32:36.332
I just got back
to the Gentlemen's Club.

32:36.400 --> 32:39.401
Heather says that Garrus got
a text, tranqed JT and ran.

32:39.471 --> 32:41.736
A text from whom?
And why would he

32:41.805 --> 32:43.705
run if there's a beast
after him?

32:43.774 --> 32:45.819
Hey, Garrus said his new beasts
were superior, right?

32:45.843 --> 32:47.909
The thing must have
sensed it was a trap.

32:47.978 --> 32:50.244
His attack was a distraction
to keep us away from Garrus.

32:50.313 --> 32:52.547
Tess, you have to get JT
and Heather into the vault.

32:52.616 --> 32:53.915
Vincent and I are...

32:53.984 --> 32:55.350
(electrical crackling)

32:55.418 --> 32:56.852
...on our way.

32:56.920 --> 33:00.855
(whooshing, panting)

33:00.923 --> 33:02.456
(dog barking in the distance)

33:02.525 --> 33:05.559
(panting)

33:07.162 --> 33:09.530
(vehicle approaching)

33:16.505 --> 33:18.237
Garrus.

33:18.306 --> 33:21.240
We're too late.

33:21.309 --> 33:24.443
He was our last chance.
What do we do now?

33:24.513 --> 33:27.747
And now we're out of options.

33:27.816 --> 33:30.116
(sighs)

33:36.624 --> 33:37.349
CATHERINE:
<i>I'm not</i>

33:37.350 --> 33:38.643
willing to give up yet.
We still have a lead.

33:38.667 --> 33:39.584
Catherine.

33:39.585 --> 33:41.585
The text-- JT can trace it.

33:41.654 --> 33:43.387
And Garrus talked
about Braxton's

33:43.456 --> 33:45.122
foreign client.

33:45.191 --> 33:46.924
We comb Graydal's records,

33:46.993 --> 33:49.893
maybe we get a name, take it
to DHS and try and make a deal.

33:49.962 --> 33:52.562
That's not gonna work.
I know it's a long shot, but...

33:52.630 --> 33:53.930
No, Cat. I talked
to Agent Dylan.

33:53.999 --> 33:56.266
Word came down from the top.
DHS will never

33:56.335 --> 33:59.202
make a deal with Vincent,
no matter what.

34:04.376 --> 34:06.141
(sighs)

34:06.210 --> 34:08.110
(sighs)

34:10.547 --> 34:15.284
Here. It's your new life.

34:15.353 --> 34:17.719
(sighing)

34:19.523 --> 34:21.822
Heather got the files
I needed to make

34:21.893 --> 34:23.891
identities to get you
out of New York.

34:23.960 --> 34:25.893
CATHERINE:
They haven't seen

34:25.962 --> 34:27.282
the video yet.
We still have time.

34:27.330 --> 34:28.795
TESS:
For what, Cat?

34:28.864 --> 34:30.431
The fight's over.

34:30.500 --> 34:32.500
We lost.

34:33.835 --> 34:36.103
None of us want
this, but...

34:36.172 --> 34:39.739
at least you'll be safe.

34:42.577 --> 34:44.777
HEATHER:
The only thing

34:44.846 --> 34:47.447
left to do is to let you go.

34:47.516 --> 34:49.416
(sniffling)

34:52.154 --> 34:53.954
(sighs)

34:55.757 --> 34:58.257
(crying)
(sniffling)

34:58.326 --> 35:00.626
(sniffling)
(sighs)

35:00.694 --> 35:03.029
(sighs)

35:06.267 --> 35:08.534
(sniffling)

35:25.718 --> 35:29.154
♪ Ooh... ooh ♪

35:29.222 --> 35:34.959
♪ Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh. ♪

35:35.027 --> 35:36.893
JT:
It feels like something

35:36.963 --> 35:38.295
terrible is happening.

35:38.364 --> 35:39.696
Something terrible
<i>is</i> happening.

35:39.765 --> 35:41.165
They're leaving.

35:41.233 --> 35:43.867
(sighs)
I miss them already.

35:43.936 --> 35:46.736
We'll make new friends.

35:48.606 --> 35:51.540
We?
It was Vincent's

35:51.609 --> 35:54.377
greatest wish that,
if they left,

35:54.446 --> 35:56.346
we'd get back together.

35:56.414 --> 35:58.181
(scoffs)

35:58.249 --> 36:00.416
Or at least have
sex one more time.

36:00.485 --> 36:03.652
(laughing):
Okay, he did not say that.

36:03.721 --> 36:05.053
I know him pretty well.

36:05.122 --> 36:06.588
I could tell
that's what he meant.

36:06.656 --> 36:09.024
Yeah, okay.

36:11.261 --> 36:14.596
He also told me I
need to get a life.

36:14.664 --> 36:17.032
Hey, I do, too.

36:18.835 --> 36:22.370
How am I supposed to do that
without my best friend?

36:25.574 --> 36:27.908
I'm available.

36:33.149 --> 36:35.883
HEATHER:
<i>If this is the end,</i>

36:35.951 --> 36:37.385
I get it.

36:37.453 --> 36:39.719
Look, I'm sorry that
I ran out on you, okay?

36:39.787 --> 36:41.721
You've been so supportive
and-and patient,

36:41.789 --> 36:43.689
and I've been acting
like a crazy person,

36:43.758 --> 36:44.961
so if you never want
to see me again...

36:44.985 --> 36:46.260
Heather.

36:46.261 --> 36:48.761
I love you.
Huh?

36:50.332 --> 36:51.931
Oh, God, now I feel even worse!

36:52.000 --> 36:54.600
Okay, I can't help that
my life is crazy, Kyle,

36:54.669 --> 36:57.136
even if it means losing
an amazing guy like you.

36:57.204 --> 36:58.703
You're not gonna lose me.

36:58.772 --> 37:00.739
And your life's not gonna be
crazy anymore,

37:00.807 --> 37:02.241
okay?

37:02.309 --> 37:05.077
What do you mean?

37:05.146 --> 37:07.312
Whatever happens next,

37:07.381 --> 37:09.748
I want you to know
I did it to protect you.

37:09.816 --> 37:11.783
Well, what did you do?

37:11.852 --> 37:13.217
I know you took those files

37:13.286 --> 37:14.885
from the hospital
for Cat and Vincent.

37:16.456 --> 37:19.223
I turned the names over to DHS.

37:19.292 --> 37:20.056
You what?!

37:20.080 --> 37:21.898
Heather, you were
in over your head.

37:22.328 --> 37:24.728
Kyle, you have no idea
what you've done.

37:24.797 --> 37:27.131
(door bells tinkle,
crowd chatter)

37:35.006 --> 37:36.839
Business class?

37:36.908 --> 37:40.610
Yeah, there's too many
looky-loos in first, you know?

37:40.679 --> 37:43.846
We're doing the
right thing, right?

37:43.915 --> 37:48.117
Yeah, well, it was the only
thing that made sense, right?

37:48.186 --> 37:51.353
It made a
lot of sense.

37:51.422 --> 37:54.190
(sirens blaring,
engine revving)

37:54.258 --> 37:56.503
WOMAN (over P.A.): This is the final
boarding call for flight 526.

37:56.527 --> 37:57.993
Please proceed to the gate.

37:58.062 --> 37:59.962
It's us.
I don't know.

38:00.030 --> 38:04.765
All of the sudden, I-I don't
feel so good about this.

38:04.834 --> 38:06.801
And I know it was my idea,

38:06.869 --> 38:09.270
but if this beast
is still out there, then...

38:09.339 --> 38:11.706
Come on, are we ever
really gonna be free?

38:11.774 --> 38:14.309
I don't know, but
I'm starting to feel

38:14.377 --> 38:17.479
like running isn't
the end of our story.

38:21.617 --> 38:23.183
(indistinct, overlapping shouting)
Go!

38:23.252 --> 38:25.652
Catherine Chandler,
Vincent Keller,

38:25.721 --> 38:27.354
you're under arrest.

38:27.423 --> 38:30.390
(overlapping chatter)
WOMAN: Keep this area clear!

38:30.459 --> 38:32.526
It's okay.
WOMAN: Get 'em out of here!

38:32.595 --> 38:35.362
