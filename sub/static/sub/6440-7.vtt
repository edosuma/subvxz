00:20.842 --> 00:24.107
You know, if you're not in the mood
for my spaghetti...

00:24.279 --> 00:26.076
...we could always order in Thai.

00:26.247 --> 00:27.874
No spaghetti, no Thai.

00:28.049 --> 00:30.813
I wanna look good for
Lana's birthday party.

00:31.352 --> 00:35.152
I just think that maybe you're focusing
a little too hard on this one party.

00:35.323 --> 00:38.315
It's not just the party, it's everything.
It's...

00:38.493 --> 00:40.393
Nobody likes me.

00:40.561 --> 00:43.291
And why should they? I'm a cow.

00:44.198 --> 00:47.861
But, I've got a new plan.

00:48.036 --> 00:51.597
From now on, no more food. Just this.

01:13.294 --> 01:16.786
Cutting the heads off supermodels.
It's kind of redundant, isn't it?

01:18.599 --> 01:21.432
Just looking for outfit ideas.

01:22.170 --> 01:24.900
I still don't have anything to wear
to Lana's party.

01:25.073 --> 01:26.267
What's up?

01:26.441 --> 01:29.672
Pete and I were hoping you could
give us a quick algebra download.

01:29.844 --> 01:32.312
I thought Clark usually helps you guys.

01:32.480 --> 01:36.007
He's a little preoccupied
helping the birthday girl.

01:36.617 --> 01:39.017
We'll even buy you lunch.

01:45.360 --> 01:48.454
That looks... appetizing.

01:51.199 --> 01:53.429
Losing weight is never pretty.

01:55.903 --> 01:57.632
Ross, we're getting a game together.

01:57.805 --> 02:00.330
Do you want in, or do you want
to keep whale-watching?

02:02.610 --> 02:04.009
Dustin, back off.

02:04.512 --> 02:07.606
Chill out, cool guy. I didn't know
you were a chubby-chaser.

02:15.990 --> 02:17.617
- Jodi, wait.
- Oh, man.

02:17.792 --> 02:20.488
You'd think someone that big
would have a thicker skin.

02:22.363 --> 02:25.628
You'd think someone that stupid
would have a thicker head.

02:32.740 --> 02:35.834
Jodi, we talked about this.
Starving yourself isn't the way.

02:36.010 --> 02:38.171
I'm tired of waiting.

02:38.346 --> 02:42.783
Waiting and weighing and keeping
a diary of everything that I eat...

02:42.950 --> 02:45.475
...so that I can feel guilty
if I have one extra grape.

02:45.653 --> 02:49.919
I understand all of that, but you can't
just stop eating. It's not healthy.

02:54.862 --> 02:57.524
Honey, you're beautiful already.

02:58.166 --> 03:00.134
Just like your mother.

03:00.635 --> 03:02.694
No, Dad. I'm not.

03:03.271 --> 03:05.671
Mom wasn't fat.

05:20.174 --> 05:22.108
Okay, that's enough.

05:23.878 --> 05:25.277
Done already?

05:25.846 --> 05:27.609
Your heart can go on
like that forever.

05:27.782 --> 05:28.874
Good.

05:29.050 --> 05:31.985
I don't want to go through
this physical nonsense for five years.

05:32.153 --> 05:33.552
Well, let's hope not.

05:33.721 --> 05:35.882
There is one thing I need
to talk to you about.

05:36.057 --> 05:40.050
Your blood work came in. You have
an unusually elevated white-cell count.

05:40.228 --> 05:42.719
What, like leukemia?

05:42.897 --> 05:44.558
That's not likely. I don't get sick.

05:44.732 --> 05:47.166
- Are you on any medication?
- Nope.

05:47.335 --> 05:48.802
- Do you have any allergies?
- No.

05:48.970 --> 05:50.665
Childhood illness?

05:52.106 --> 05:53.937
- Asthma.
- When did that stop?

05:54.675 --> 05:57.906
The day I lost my hair.
Is this going somewhere?

05:58.079 --> 06:00.172
If this were anywhere else,
I'd order a battery of tests.

06:00.348 --> 06:02.282
But I do see a lot of this in Smallville.

06:02.450 --> 06:04.418
Why should Smallville be any different?

06:04.585 --> 06:10.922
Well, some say it's because the LuthorCorp
plant has contaminated the environment.

06:12.960 --> 06:15.155
I very much doubt that.

06:18.032 --> 06:19.932
Let's order those tests.

06:27.008 --> 06:28.669
Now, I want this to be special.

06:28.843 --> 06:31.175
What do you think about
a three-tier birthday cake?

06:31.345 --> 06:33.108
Thanks for the lifeline.

06:33.281 --> 06:36.273
It's a math midterm. I didn't pull you
out of a burning building.

06:36.450 --> 06:38.680
- I still appreciate it.
- Lana?

06:38.853 --> 06:41.048
I wanted to get your opinion
on the balloons.

06:41.222 --> 06:43.417
Now, I think white always looks good.

06:43.591 --> 06:46.560
- Works for me.
- Okay.

06:47.895 --> 06:50.864
This whole birthday extravaganza
has been pretty distracting.

06:51.032 --> 06:54.331
Having a birthday party at Lex's mansion
seems pretty cool to me.

06:54.502 --> 06:57.062
It stopped being my party a long time ago.

06:57.938 --> 07:01.567
If it was up to me, it would be pizza
and loud music with my friends.

07:03.277 --> 07:04.608
Did you tell Nell that?

07:05.112 --> 07:09.048
We've been through a lot the past few
months. I figure I should give her this one.

07:10.685 --> 07:12.209
Lana, guess what.

07:12.386 --> 07:14.411
The scout called!

07:14.588 --> 07:18.490
- I got the tryout with Kansas State.
- That's incredible!

07:18.659 --> 07:20.024
Hey, congrats.

07:21.429 --> 07:22.760
I haven't said yes yet.

07:22.930 --> 07:25.262
They want me there on Saturday,
your big night.

07:25.433 --> 07:28.766
It's Nell's big night. I was just
telling Clark it wasn't important.

07:29.637 --> 07:31.298
Yeah, Scout's honor.

07:31.672 --> 07:33.572
I want you to go.

07:40.014 --> 07:42.346
Hey, I'll catch up with you guys later.

07:43.117 --> 07:45.881
<i>Clark, I'm telling you,
this is good news for you.</i>

07:46.053 --> 07:49.921
Kansas State gives Whitney a full scholarship
and Lana gives him a tongue bath.

07:50.091 --> 07:51.115
How is that good news?

07:51.292 --> 07:53.852
Even I'm having a hard time
following this skewed logic.

07:54.028 --> 07:57.361
Lana's going to be dateless
for her own party.

07:57.965 --> 07:58.954
Hi, Pete.

08:03.637 --> 08:05.195
Jodi?

08:08.075 --> 08:09.406
You look...

08:09.577 --> 08:10.976
Thinner?

08:12.012 --> 08:15.175
I was still looking for a euphemism,
but, yeah.

08:15.349 --> 08:16.816
- Are you okay?
- Never better.

08:16.984 --> 08:20.886
My diet's just starting to pay off.
Bought some new clothes.

08:21.889 --> 08:22.981
You look great.

08:23.958 --> 08:26.188
Thank you for sticking up for me yesterday.

08:26.360 --> 08:28.419
Most people wouldn't have done that.

08:28.596 --> 08:30.587
Most people can't stand Dustin.

08:30.765 --> 08:32.164
Yeah.

08:33.701 --> 08:38.764
Listen. I was wondering,
do you have a date for Lana's party?

08:44.078 --> 08:45.477
No, he's still free.

08:46.480 --> 08:48.744
Would you like to go with me?

08:53.654 --> 08:55.315
He'd love to.

08:55.489 --> 08:58.287
Great. Okay, well, I'll see you later.

09:01.095 --> 09:02.858
Bye.

09:06.434 --> 09:08.231
I don't get it.

09:09.370 --> 09:11.634
Women dig me. Get used to it.

09:11.806 --> 09:15.003
No, I mean Jodi. It's like
she lost that weight overnight.

09:15.176 --> 09:18.907
If she could do that, half the school
would be after that secret. Come on.

09:19.079 --> 09:20.774
Let's go.

09:22.850 --> 09:25.148
- Hello.
- Lana, hi. Come in.

09:25.319 --> 09:26.684
Hey.

09:26.854 --> 09:28.879
Lana, can I interest you in a latte?

09:29.056 --> 09:32.150
I'll pass. Bad waitressing flashbacks.

09:32.326 --> 09:34.487
I brought over the produce order
for the party.

09:34.662 --> 09:38.029
- You could have called it in.
- And miss a chance to get out of the house?

09:38.199 --> 09:40.633
Nell's planning this party
like a royal wedding.

09:40.801 --> 09:42.826
Oh, yeah, I can tell.

09:44.672 --> 09:47.835
Dad, I got the posts in the west field.

09:48.008 --> 09:51.466
I hit some granite, but I jammed it through.

09:55.382 --> 09:56.542
Very impressive.

09:57.985 --> 09:59.316
I had a sledgehammer.

10:03.123 --> 10:05.489
Somebody's gotta work around here.

10:09.730 --> 10:12.563
Thought you'd be posing
for ice sculptures by now.

10:12.733 --> 10:14.325
I'm hiding out.

10:15.269 --> 10:18.033
You have my sympathies.
Whitney's not even here for backup.

10:18.205 --> 10:22.198
I know. I was contemplating stowing away
in the back of his truck on Saturday.

10:22.376 --> 10:25.243
A no-show at your own party.
That would keep the town talking.

10:25.412 --> 10:27.073
I wouldn't do that to Nell.

10:27.248 --> 10:30.217
It's just, all this attention
is a little unnerving.

10:30.784 --> 10:33.617
Well, if you like,
I could be your escort on Saturday.

10:36.423 --> 10:40.553
You know, so I can fend off
the throngs of adoring fans.

10:42.263 --> 10:44.629
- I'd like that.
- Great.

10:46.767 --> 10:48.098
I better go.

10:48.269 --> 10:51.932
If I'm away too long, Nell will
probably send out a search party.

10:53.707 --> 10:55.197
And Clark...

10:56.410 --> 10:58.310
Promise me you'll make it this time.

10:59.246 --> 11:00.440
I promise.

11:04.418 --> 11:06.283
- Thanks.
- Bye.

11:10.124 --> 11:13.093
Escort to fend off the adoring fans?

11:13.260 --> 11:16.252
- What's wrong with that?
- Nothing, Clark.

11:16.864 --> 11:18.889
I just don't want to see you get hurt.

11:19.567 --> 11:21.660
Mom, Lana and I are just friends.

11:22.403 --> 11:23.495
Okay.

11:23.671 --> 11:25.434
I'm officially butting out.

11:25.606 --> 11:27.733
So, what are you gonna get her
for her birthday?

11:27.908 --> 11:29.375
I don't know.

11:29.977 --> 11:31.604
Any ideas?

11:31.779 --> 11:36.239
My mother always said the best gifts
come from the heart.

11:41.789 --> 11:44.087
Jodi, you feeling okay?
You look a little...

11:44.258 --> 11:46.624
Yeah, don't worry, Dad, I'm feeling great.

11:46.794 --> 11:49.285
I even got a date for Lana's party.

11:49.463 --> 11:51.693
Jodi, that's terrific.

11:52.366 --> 11:56.996
But I want you to eat something more
than those shake things, all right?

11:57.171 --> 11:59.264
You know what? I will.

11:59.440 --> 12:01.704
I'm done counting calories.

12:02.943 --> 12:04.342
I've gotta go.

12:04.511 --> 12:07.912
- Don't stay up too late.
- Okay.

12:09.883 --> 12:11.407
Bye!

15:26.914 --> 15:28.882
Getting your morning Lana fix?

15:30.884 --> 15:32.374
Chloe, don't you ever knock?

15:32.553 --> 15:34.851
It's a barn, Clark.

15:35.589 --> 15:39.389
Is there a reason you're here early,
or do you just enjoy busting my chops?

15:39.560 --> 15:40.584
A little of both.

15:40.761 --> 15:44.162
Did you hear about the accident last night?
A deer was hit out on Route 5.

15:44.331 --> 15:48.131
- It's not exactly "Wall of Weird" material.
- Check out the paper.

15:48.302 --> 15:51.533
Animal Control said that
the deer died of causes unknown.

15:51.705 --> 15:53.036
So?

15:53.640 --> 15:56.234
Not much unknown about
a bumper at 60 miles per hour.

15:56.410 --> 15:59.675
I'd love to run down theories with you,
but I've got chores to do.

16:00.514 --> 16:03.540
And I still haven't figured out
what to get Lana for her birthday.

16:03.717 --> 16:06.618
Well, you or your family knows
people at Animal Control, right?

16:06.787 --> 16:08.311
One perk of growing up on a farm.

16:08.488 --> 16:10.581
I was thinking we could
stop by before school.

16:10.757 --> 16:13.089
You could use your pull,
take a couple of pictures.

16:13.260 --> 16:15.626
I'll help you out with
your gift-giving dilemma.

16:16.563 --> 16:19.794
Okay, but I want it to be something unique.

16:21.068 --> 16:23.832
Just don't make it as unique
as what you gave me last year.

16:24.004 --> 16:27.201
Very impressive use of pull:
"Can I use your bathroom?"

16:27.374 --> 16:29.535
I can't believe
we're looking for road kill.

16:29.710 --> 16:30.938
The deer's in there.

16:33.013 --> 16:34.378
The door's locked.

16:35.515 --> 16:37.676
I'm gonna go find a maintenance worker.

16:43.690 --> 16:44.987
Chloe, it's open.

16:47.527 --> 16:48.551
How'd you do that?

16:48.729 --> 16:50.356
Kent charm.

17:01.842 --> 17:03.707
Lift it up. Go.

17:06.713 --> 17:08.078
Looks like jerky.

17:14.454 --> 17:18.049
The lab report says the deer lost
something like 80 percent of its body fat.

17:19.059 --> 17:21.185
It's like it's been liposuctioned to death.

17:21.929 --> 17:24.659
What do you think it is?
Some fat-sucking vampire in town?

17:25.632 --> 17:29.898
This is Smallville, Clark.
Land of the weird, home of the strange.

17:55.062 --> 17:58.088
Jodi, honey, are you-?
Are you okay in there?

17:58.265 --> 18:00.062
Yeah, Dad, I'm fine.

18:00.233 --> 18:02.428
Well, I'm afraid I've got some bad news.

18:02.602 --> 18:06.504
I've gotta go to Metropolis for a few days
or I'm going to lose this client.

18:06.673 --> 18:08.504
When will you be back?

18:08.675 --> 18:12.771
Not till Sunday morning, which means
I'm gonna miss your big date.

18:13.914 --> 18:15.814
It's okay, it's no big deal.

18:16.249 --> 18:20.117
Well, do you think maybe
I could see you before I leave?

18:21.521 --> 18:24.490
I'm kind of indecent at the moment.

18:27.694 --> 18:31.562
Honey, I think that maybe
we need to talk to somebody.

18:31.732 --> 18:33.757
I don't need a shrink.

18:33.934 --> 18:38.530
I just want you to look in a mirror
and be happy.

18:42.409 --> 18:45.708
Daddy, I am.

19:14.841 --> 19:17.639
Most of my friends are trying
to get out of high school.

19:17.811 --> 19:19.608
I was meeting with your principal.

19:19.780 --> 19:22.476
Apparently, you guys are
in dire need of a new computer lab.

19:22.649 --> 19:24.014
I figured I could help.

19:24.184 --> 19:27.210
They might even
name a lunch special after you.

19:27.387 --> 19:30.720
- How'd you end up here?
- My plant manager, Gabe.

19:30.891 --> 19:34.554
<i>He's always going on about his daughter,
the reporter on the Torch.</i>

19:34.728 --> 19:36.525
Thought I'd drop by and say hello.

19:36.696 --> 19:40.097
- She wasn't around, but I was struck by this.
- That's Chloe's hobby.

19:40.267 --> 19:43.998
She thinks she can trace all the freak
things in Smallville to the meteor shower.

19:44.171 --> 19:46.002
Interesting theory.

19:46.173 --> 19:48.471
Most people think it's crazy.

19:48.642 --> 19:50.041
Maybe.

19:50.811 --> 19:53.575
Do you remember where you were
when they fell?

19:54.448 --> 19:55.915
Not really.

19:56.950 --> 19:59.510
- My parents hadn't adopted me yet.
- I do.

20:00.353 --> 20:02.617
I was right here in Smallville.

20:02.789 --> 20:06.088
My mother wanted me to spend
some quality time with my dad.

20:06.259 --> 20:08.591
He brought me here on a business trip.

20:08.762 --> 20:12.323
Just a quick hop to Smallville
to finalize a deal.

20:12.933 --> 20:15.561
Funny how one day
can change your whole life.

20:16.269 --> 20:17.759
What happened?

20:19.439 --> 20:21.930
I was out in a corn field
when the first meteor hit.

20:23.577 --> 20:27.035
It was like a tidal wave coming at me.

20:28.482 --> 20:30.450
Then everything went black.

20:31.551 --> 20:36.011
Next thing I remember, I was waking up
in Metropolis General completely bald.

20:37.757 --> 20:39.247
Lex, I didn't know.

20:40.927 --> 20:43.259
Not many people do, Clark.

20:43.430 --> 20:47.366
I should have died that day.
Instead, I walked away with this.

20:47.534 --> 20:50.731
- I'm sorry.
- Why? It's not your fault.

20:52.439 --> 20:54.839
When I was younger,
I thought it was a curse.

20:55.442 --> 20:58.104
Kids figured I was a freak or on chemo.

20:58.979 --> 21:01.209
Then I began to see it as my gift.

21:01.381 --> 21:03.906
The thing that defined me,
that gave me strength.

21:04.084 --> 21:06.575
You ever wonder what you'd be like?

21:07.154 --> 21:09.179
You know, if you hadn't come that day?

21:09.556 --> 21:11.387
It doesn't matter, Clark. It happened.

21:12.092 --> 21:15.084
Personally, I think my future's
gonna be brighter...

21:15.262 --> 21:18.459
...than that spoiled rich brat
that walked into that corn field.

21:20.700 --> 21:21.792
Mr. Luthor.

21:24.237 --> 21:25.636
It's Lex.

21:27.073 --> 21:29.633
Clark was just telling me
your meteor theory. I like it.

21:29.809 --> 21:30.798
Thanks.

21:30.977 --> 21:33.946
Especially since most people think
my company's behind everything...

21:34.114 --> 21:37.242
- ... that goes wrong in Smallville.
- That's the reigning theory.

21:37.417 --> 21:40.147
Are you the only one
that blames the meteors instead of me?

21:40.320 --> 21:42.618
Pretty much. Well, there is Mr. Hamilton.

21:42.789 --> 21:47.317
Except most don't have high regard for a guy
who sells plastic meteor chips to tourists.

21:47.494 --> 21:50.088
Doesn't exactly inspire confidence.

21:51.231 --> 21:55.224
<i>Call me when you're looking for a summer
job. I've got friends over at the Inquisitor.</i>

21:55.402 --> 21:56.994
I'll see you tomorrow.

21:57.170 --> 22:00.037
I hear you're escorting
the birthday girl. Nice work.

22:01.575 --> 22:03.133
We're just going as friends.

22:04.611 --> 22:08.047
Sure you are. Hope you got her a nice gift.

22:10.016 --> 22:11.347
Yeah.

22:12.085 --> 22:14.485
Jodi, I didn't see you in class. Are you okay?

22:14.654 --> 22:18.647
Yeah, I'm fine, just stomach flu.
I can't keep anything down.

22:18.825 --> 22:22.056
- Maybe you should go see the nurse.
- I've got it under control.

22:22.896 --> 22:24.295
Are you sure you're okay?

22:24.464 --> 22:27.695
I'm fine. I just need to rest up
for tomorrow night.

22:28.602 --> 22:29.830
Look.

22:30.003 --> 22:32.494
If you don't feel up to it, I'll understand.

22:33.907 --> 22:35.602
Are you kidding?

22:35.775 --> 22:37.936
I wouldn't miss this for the world.

22:47.754 --> 22:50.382
Hey, Jodi. I've been watching you.

22:50.557 --> 22:52.286
I bet you have.

22:52.459 --> 22:54.154
Hitting the gym was a good idea.

22:54.794 --> 22:56.785
You should take your own advice.

22:58.164 --> 23:00.029
Whoa. You all right?

23:03.903 --> 23:05.962
I'm just a little hungry.

23:14.381 --> 23:17.441
You like what you see?

23:20.320 --> 23:21.548
Totally.

23:23.323 --> 23:28.727
I'll bet you wouldn't mind seeing
a little bit more, would you?

23:30.864 --> 23:33.196
Follow me.

23:37.904 --> 23:41.032
<i>- Confederacy of Dunces.
- First edition.</i>

23:41.941 --> 23:45.308
- Early birthday gift?
- From Whitney. I couldn't believe it.

23:46.913 --> 23:48.107
It's a cool gift.

23:48.715 --> 23:52.276
That's the thing with Whitney. Sometimes
I think he's a million miles away...

23:52.452 --> 23:55.615
...and then he surprises me
with something like this.

24:00.727 --> 24:03.719
- How are things on the party front?
- I surrendered.

24:03.897 --> 24:06.559
I told Nell to make
the final decisions without me.

24:06.733 --> 24:08.758
I cannot believe how anti-birthday you are.

24:08.935 --> 24:11.369
- Haven't you ever had a happy birthday?
- Once.

24:11.971 --> 24:13.461
Went to a drive-in.

24:14.474 --> 24:18.501
- That doesn't sound like Nell's style.
- I was with my parents.

24:18.678 --> 24:24.116
My dad pulled the car up to the first row
so the screen filled up the entire windshield.

24:25.418 --> 24:29.684
I remember feeling all grown up because
I got to sit in the front seat with them.

24:29.856 --> 24:33.622
They played Bugs Bunny cartoons
before the movie started.

24:33.793 --> 24:37.422
I was cold, so my mom
wrapped me up in her sweater.

24:38.498 --> 24:39.658
That sounds nice.

24:39.833 --> 24:42.563
I fell asleep before the movie even started...

24:42.736 --> 24:44.670
...between my mom and dad.

24:46.506 --> 24:50.533
It's the last time I can remember
feeling completely safe.

24:53.880 --> 24:55.507
That's a great memory.

25:10.663 --> 25:11.994
Hey.

25:12.899 --> 25:16.665
- We're fine. No one's gonna see us.
- Good.

25:24.711 --> 25:28.875
You don't think I ever meant that stuff
I said about you when you were-?

25:29.048 --> 25:30.447
Fat?

25:31.351 --> 25:33.319
You thought it was funny...

25:33.486 --> 25:37.923
...calling me names, making me cry...

25:38.091 --> 25:41.458
...making me wish
that I were dead rather than fat.

25:43.730 --> 25:46.722
- Well, what can I say?
- You can say you're sorry.

26:37.917 --> 26:40.977
Help me.

27:26.799 --> 27:28.630
Don't touch that.

27:28.801 --> 27:30.792
You're not sterile and you're not me.

27:31.304 --> 27:33.135
My apologies, Dr. Hamilton.

27:34.541 --> 27:36.702
You don't have a website, do you?

27:36.876 --> 27:38.070
Excuse me?

27:38.244 --> 27:42.874
They're usually the ones who track me down.
The freaks with websites.

27:43.049 --> 27:45.313
I'm just a fan.

27:45.485 --> 27:47.009
Lex Luthor.

27:47.954 --> 27:50.013
The billionaire's son.

27:50.690 --> 27:54.148
Mineralogists don't have fans.

27:58.031 --> 28:00.966
<i>Most mineralogists didn't handle
the first Apollo moon rocks.</i>

28:01.134 --> 28:04.797
That was a lifetime ago
when I was a respectable scientist.

28:06.472 --> 28:09.066
You know, we may have
a few things in common.

28:09.242 --> 28:12.405
I was kicked out
of Metropolis University too.

28:15.448 --> 28:18.110
Ever since I found out about
a medical condition I have...

28:18.284 --> 28:20.946
...I've become very interested
in your work, Dr. Hamilton.

28:21.120 --> 28:24.055
And you think it has
something to do with the meteors.

28:24.791 --> 28:29.353
Isn't that your theory? The meteors
somehow alter cellular makeup?

28:29.529 --> 28:32.726
That sounds to me
like research worth funding.

28:35.234 --> 28:40.171
Yes, well, sorry. My funding is private,
and so are my results.

28:40.340 --> 28:42.240
Your funding comes from tourists.

28:42.408 --> 28:46.504
If you are so interested in meteors,
here, take one.

28:46.679 --> 28:50.171
Enjoy it. I have nothing else for sale.

28:51.618 --> 28:54.644
When you change your mind,
you know where to find me.

29:02.161 --> 29:04.254
I called the hospital. Dustin's in a coma.

29:04.430 --> 29:08.025
His body went into shock with the loss
of fat. He hasn't told the police anything.

29:08.201 --> 29:10.499
Time to revisit
the fat-sucking vampire theory.

29:10.670 --> 29:13.867
You know, if you hadn't been there,
he probably would have died, Clark.

29:14.040 --> 29:16.804
I can't figure out why anybody
would want to steal body fat.

29:16.976 --> 29:19.536
I know. It takes eating disorders
to a whole new level.

29:20.847 --> 29:21.973
Jodi.

29:22.515 --> 29:25.780
- Hi, guys, what's up?
- Study group, remember?

29:27.353 --> 29:29.617
Totally slipped my mind.

29:31.024 --> 29:33.458
So no more veggie shakes, huh?

29:36.663 --> 29:39.530
Are you feeling okay?
Pete said you felt sick yesterday.

29:39.999 --> 29:41.489
Oh, that.

29:42.135 --> 29:43.625
I'm fully recovered.

29:47.340 --> 29:49.808
I guess it's safe to say
that the diet's finally over.

29:50.576 --> 29:53.909
I'm starving.
I haven't eaten anything all day.

29:58.618 --> 30:01.985
I'm just a little nervous
about the party tonight.

30:03.189 --> 30:04.417
Yeah.

30:18.538 --> 30:20.631
I'll see you guys tonight.

30:29.716 --> 30:32.879
- Okay, what was that about?
- I don't know.

30:34.187 --> 30:37.350
- I gotta fly. We'll talk about this later?
- Okay.

30:37.523 --> 30:40.822
- Hey, where are you going?
- I'm still working on Lana's birthday gift.

30:40.993 --> 30:42.119
Any hints?

30:42.295 --> 30:45.196
Yeah. It's not a gift certificate.

31:05.017 --> 31:06.541
What do you think?

31:06.719 --> 31:08.880
- It's really...
- Not you at all.

31:10.723 --> 31:13.248
I heard the quarterback
couldn't make it. Too bad.

31:13.426 --> 31:15.724
I knew you'd be devastated.

31:15.895 --> 31:18.830
Whitney's trying out for a football
scholarship to Kansas State.

31:18.998 --> 31:21.228
He didn't think he made the cut,
but someone fell out.

31:21.400 --> 31:22.731
I know.

31:24.504 --> 31:26.438
Your aunt told me.

31:28.207 --> 31:30.869
I like your new escort better.

31:32.245 --> 31:33.872
Have fun tonight.

31:40.253 --> 31:42.221
- Mom, you almost done?
- Relax, Clark.

31:42.388 --> 31:44.515
You're not going to be late for once.

31:45.057 --> 31:47.582
By the way, did you figure out
what to get Lana?

31:47.760 --> 31:49.421
Yeah, Lex helped me out.

31:49.595 --> 31:51.290
So, what is it?

31:51.898 --> 31:54.093
I thought you were butting out of this.

31:54.600 --> 31:57.194
Then you better learn how to iron.

31:58.404 --> 32:00.429
- Hi, Chloe.
- Hi, Mrs. Kent.

32:00.606 --> 32:03.473
- You've gotta take a look at this.
- Why aren't you dressed?

32:03.643 --> 32:06.771
I didn't have time. You really,
really need to check this out.

32:07.880 --> 32:11.281
"Smallville Body and Fender.
Replace windshield, replace side-panels.

32:11.450 --> 32:15.216
- Cause of accident, impact with deer"?
- It was Jodi's car, Clark.

32:15.388 --> 32:19.722
- What do you think happened to her?
- Her house is right next to a big meteor hit.

32:19.892 --> 32:21.985
She lost all that weight...

32:22.161 --> 32:25.096
...by drinking juice from vegetables
grown in her greenhouse.

32:25.264 --> 32:28.722
She's losing weight too fast
to keep up with regular food.

32:28.901 --> 32:31.062
- And that's why she needs body fat.
- Exactly.

32:31.237 --> 32:33.068
We need to find her.

32:33.506 --> 32:36.737
Jodi wouldn't let anything keep her
from getting to that party.

32:37.777 --> 32:38.766
Pete.

32:49.755 --> 32:51.313
Perfect.

32:58.497 --> 33:00.192
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:00.366 --> 33:02.926
Perfect flowers for a perfect date.

33:08.708 --> 33:10.938
They're beautiful, Pete.

33:11.577 --> 33:13.340
So is that dress.

33:13.946 --> 33:15.971
Thanks. It was my mom's.

33:21.320 --> 33:22.651
Is something wrong?

33:23.556 --> 33:26.320
I'm fine. I just need to eat.

33:32.698 --> 33:36.031
That doesn't sound right.
Maybe we should go to the hospital.

33:38.771 --> 33:41.706
You've always been good to me, Pete.

33:41.874 --> 33:43.171
- Please go away now.
- Jodi.

33:44.377 --> 33:46.174
Go away.

33:47.413 --> 33:48.641
Jodi, wait!

33:51.717 --> 33:52.945
Jodi!

33:54.854 --> 33:56.253
Jodi, come on!

33:57.723 --> 33:59.190
Jodi.

34:02.328 --> 34:03.989
Jodi?

34:08.467 --> 34:10.025
Jodi, where are you?

34:12.371 --> 34:14.703
Pete, please get away.

34:16.042 --> 34:18.476
- It's all my fault.
- Jodi?

34:18.878 --> 34:23.110
I just wanted to be thin.
There's only so much a person can take.

34:23.949 --> 34:26.384
Pete, please go home.

34:26.552 --> 34:28.884
Come on, Jodi, you don't have to hide.

34:29.989 --> 34:32.617
I don't wanna hurt you.

34:32.792 --> 34:35.123
Come on, Jodi, you couldn't hurt a-

34:43.369 --> 34:45.701
Just tell me what's happening.

34:45.871 --> 34:48.498
Please leave.

35:13.299 --> 35:14.288
Jodi?

35:16.502 --> 35:17.696
Pete!

35:26.779 --> 35:29.043
Pete, are you okay?
Pete, what's wrong?

35:40.993 --> 35:42.051
Jodi!

35:52.071 --> 35:55.234
- Why can't you just leave me alone?
- You're sick.

35:55.408 --> 35:57.569
Whatever you did to yourself,
you can get help.

35:57.743 --> 35:59.768
All I wanted was to be thin.

36:13.025 --> 36:14.492
Jodi, this isn't you.

36:15.594 --> 36:19.257
What, isn't this
what I'm supposed to look like?

36:44.824 --> 36:48.021
Look at me. I'm a freak.

36:51.864 --> 36:53.798
I know how to stop this for good.

37:00.473 --> 37:01.770
Wait!

37:17.089 --> 37:18.920
Jodi?

37:33.005 --> 37:35.701
Pete! Get over here, quick!

37:37.209 --> 37:38.437
Clark?

37:44.250 --> 37:45.649
Is she okay?

37:45.818 --> 37:49.083
I think so, but we need
to get her to a hospital.

38:07.373 --> 38:09.136
Sneaking out, huh?

38:09.742 --> 38:11.573
Isn't this your shindig?

38:11.844 --> 38:15.575
- Says so on all the invitations.
- Right.

38:17.049 --> 38:20.041
You're not hiding,
you're getting some air.

38:22.555 --> 38:25.956
I spent 18 years of Luthor
Christmas parties in the coatroom.

38:28.027 --> 38:30.222
Still waiting for my reinforcements.

38:32.097 --> 38:34.657
I know Clark, he'll be here...

38:34.833 --> 38:38.325
- ... if he can.
- It's just a birthday.

39:07.866 --> 39:09.891
Clark, what happened?
The police called.

39:10.069 --> 39:12.094
- I'm fine.
- How's Pete?

39:12.271 --> 39:15.365
He's got a serious migraine,
but other than that, he's okay.

39:15.541 --> 39:19.033
Jodi's on the way to Metropolis General.
Her father's gonna meet her there.

39:19.211 --> 39:21.679
Clark, I'm sorry about the party.

39:21.847 --> 39:24.213
I promised Lana I'd be there.

39:25.851 --> 39:27.375
I can't believe I let her down.

39:27.553 --> 39:30.249
Well, when you do the things you do,
son, helping people...

39:30.422 --> 39:32.322
...sometimes you have to make sacrifices.

39:32.491 --> 39:34.482
- Like Lana?
- Maybe...

39:34.660 --> 39:37.288
...but you made your choice.

39:38.864 --> 39:40.422
Where are you going?

39:40.599 --> 39:42.999
I don't have to sacrifice everything.

40:12.931 --> 40:14.421
Back for some more rocks?

40:15.801 --> 40:17.735
Apparently, I have a clean bill of health.

40:17.903 --> 40:21.395
Congratulations. I guess that means
you won't be bothering me anymore.

40:21.674 --> 40:24.700
I couldn't figure out why
you're so resistant to accept my help...

40:24.877 --> 40:27.107
...then I had a friend do some digging.

40:28.047 --> 40:33.280
I thought you got kicked out of Metropolis
University for your meteor theories.

40:33.452 --> 40:36.910
But apparently it was
your student-teacher relations.

40:37.523 --> 40:39.991
I wonder if the Smallville Police
had you register.

40:43.729 --> 40:44.991
Get out.

40:50.235 --> 40:52.499
I want you to look at something.

40:57.309 --> 41:01.370
I don't care about the past.
I believe in the power to reinvent yourself.

41:01.980 --> 41:04.107
You want to prove
you've been right all along?

41:04.283 --> 41:06.183
That check should cover your vindication.

41:08.253 --> 41:11.814
What you're looking for could take years.

41:14.226 --> 41:16.285
I'm a patient man.

41:20.199 --> 41:24.135
Tell me, why does a billionaire's son
care so much about a bunch of rocks...

41:24.303 --> 41:26.737
...that fell out of the sky 12 years ago?

41:27.473 --> 41:30.965
I save that story for the people I trust.

41:51.597 --> 41:53.394
Kind of missed cocktail hour.

41:54.400 --> 41:55.890
I'm sorry.

41:58.170 --> 42:01.230
I told you I stopped believing
in happy birthdays a long time ago.

42:02.941 --> 42:05.307
Well, maybe I can change that.

42:07.379 --> 42:11.110
Okay, I know I blew it tonight,
but at least let me give you your present.

42:12.117 --> 42:13.448
When?

42:14.319 --> 42:15.377
Now.

42:26.999 --> 42:28.899
Pass the popcorn.

42:34.740 --> 42:36.230
- Lana.
- Yes?

42:37.209 --> 42:39.374
Happy birthday.

42:40.305 --> 42:46.711
