WEBVTT

00:03.500 --> 00:06.707
- In 1942, SS
chief Heinrich Himmler

00:06.708 --> 00:08.916
initiated Operation Reinhardt,

00:08.917 --> 00:12.708
Nazi Germany's final solution
to the Jewish question.

00:13.583 --> 00:15.291
Three death camps were built

00:15.292 --> 00:17.541
and staffed under top secret orders.

00:17.542 --> 00:20.624
These camps, all in eastern
Poland, were Belzec,

00:20.625 --> 00:24.541
Treblinka and the most secret Sobibor.

00:24.542 --> 00:28.832
Sobibor, it was here
on October 14th, 1943,

00:28.833 --> 00:31.666
that the biggest, most
successful prisoner revolt

00:31.667 --> 00:34.041
in World War II took place.

00:34.042 --> 00:35.375
This is that story.

01:48.417 --> 01:49.916
- Did you speak to them?

01:49.917 --> 01:51.416
- Yes, Leon.

01:51.417 --> 01:54.082
- But they're still going to do it.

01:55.917 --> 01:58.624
Leon, Leon.

01:58.625 --> 02:00.374
- What's going on?

02:00.375 --> 02:02.832
- We're assigned to the
vegetable lot today.

02:02.833 --> 02:05.499
While you're all at the
station, we are going to go.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.999
We've been working on that
fence, it's our chance.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.582
- In broad daylight through the minefield?

02:09.583 --> 02:10.832
It's crazy, you'll never make it.

02:10.833 --> 02:12.791
- We have the courage right now.

02:12.792 --> 02:14.582
Who knows if we do tomorrow?

02:14.583 --> 02:16.874
Leon, we're going to do
it, nobody can stop us.

02:18.543 --> 02:19.749
- Good luck.

02:23.667 --> 02:24.500
- Get into line.

02:24.500 --> 02:25.500
Move!

03:34.292 --> 03:35.292
- Quick, run!

03:47.500 --> 03:49.833
- It's nothing but a
little target practice.

03:54.583 --> 03:56.458
I want no problems here today.

04:03.500 --> 04:05.332
Is that clear?

04:05.333 --> 04:07.542
Take your positions, dismissed.

04:38.500 --> 04:41.457
- Attention, railroad brigade Jews.

04:41.458 --> 04:44.707
As always, I expect you to be smiling

04:44.708 --> 04:46.541
when the train arrives.

04:46.542 --> 04:49.832
Remember, we are welcoming these people.

04:49.833 --> 04:51.417
This will run smoothly.

04:52.708 --> 04:54.749
If there's a problem like yesterday's,

04:54.750 --> 04:57.374
if people panic or try to run

04:57.375 --> 05:00.875
I don't have to remind
you, you will be killed.

05:46.792 --> 05:47.667
- Water.

05:47.668 --> 05:49.041
Give me water.

05:49.042 --> 05:50.582
Water.

05:50.583 --> 05:51.667
Water, water.

06:30.333 --> 06:31.917
- Move it, come on!

06:54.667 --> 06:55.749
- Please no!

07:21.417 --> 07:24.166
- Remember, we've got to stay together.

07:24.167 --> 07:25.000
- Shlomo.
- Papa.

07:25.001 --> 07:26.083
- We should hold hands.

07:34.167 --> 07:35.167
- You!

07:40.542 --> 07:42.791
- Come, get moving!

07:52.333 --> 07:54.457
You, you get back.

07:54.458 --> 07:55.791
Get back, I say.

08:18.833 --> 08:20.207
- You must leave your bag.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.208
- No.

08:35.917 --> 08:37.207
- Stay right next to me.

08:38.207 --> 08:41.082
- If you want to stay together, volunteer.

08:51.792 --> 08:54.750
When they ask you, tell
them you have a trade.

08:58.208 --> 08:59.292
- Move!

09:05.958 --> 09:08.541
- Johnny.

09:13.458 --> 09:14.458
- Quiet.

09:15.375 --> 09:16.375
Quiet.

09:20.417 --> 09:22.042
Stand where you are and be quiet.

09:23.125 --> 09:27.207
You will be separated into
two groups, just temporarily.

09:27.208 --> 09:30.291
Women and children on
this side, men and boys,

09:30.292 --> 09:33.625
14 years of age or older, on the other.

09:34.500 --> 09:38.667
Those who are ill or too weak
to walk will be assisted.

09:39.500 --> 09:42.541
Leave your luggage, it will
be brought to you later.

09:42.542 --> 09:44.499
Now, move as quickly as possible.

09:44.500 --> 09:45.500
Move.

09:48.083 --> 09:49.417
- Come on.

09:54.583 --> 09:56.082
- Come on!

09:56.083 --> 09:57.083
Hurry up.

09:57.833 --> 09:59.582
- Ladies, come this way.

10:03.500 --> 10:05.041
- Over here.

10:05.042 --> 10:06.749
- Shlomo, Moses.

10:06.750 --> 10:07.708
My babies.
- Mama, he said

10:07.709 --> 10:09.791
we'll be together in a little while.

10:09.792 --> 10:11.457
- Yes, a little while.

10:11.458 --> 10:12.957
Kiss your sister.

10:12.958 --> 10:13.875
- Mama, which side do I go?

10:13.876 --> 10:16.125
- Women and boys--
- No, no!

10:17.875 --> 10:20.082
- Don't start anything.

10:20.083 --> 10:21.083
Move, back.

10:22.167 --> 10:23.707
Move, back.

10:28.250 --> 10:30.667
- Move back, move back.

10:35.083 --> 10:37.707
- All the sick on the top.

10:37.708 --> 10:39.708
On the wagon, over here.

10:41.958 --> 10:42.792
Come on you, you.

10:42.793 --> 10:45.041
Take the women, quick.

10:45.042 --> 10:45.875
Get over there.

10:45.876 --> 10:48.208
Get over there with the men.

10:50.875 --> 10:52.958
- Move, move, move.

11:07.958 --> 11:08.958
- Observe.

11:14.125 --> 11:15.125
Do you see?

11:16.333 --> 11:18.333
How I'm scattering this?

11:19.375 --> 11:20.625
Grain by grain.

11:23.625 --> 11:28.042
That will be what will happen
with your filthy Reich.

11:29.333 --> 11:33.541
It will vanish like flying
dust and passing smoke.

11:38.292 --> 11:39.292
- No.

11:46.333 --> 11:49.083
You stand right here and
don't move until I tell you.

11:54.667 --> 11:57.750
- Let her, let her come back.

12:03.292 --> 12:04.791
- Silence.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.207
Silence.

12:06.208 --> 12:09.124
I want everyone to listen to me carefully.

12:09.125 --> 12:10.833
You have arrived at Sobibor.

12:11.708 --> 12:13.250
You are in eastern Poland.

12:14.250 --> 12:15.999
This is a labor camp.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.957
We have brought you here to work.

12:17.958 --> 12:21.917
You will work hard, but hard
work is good for the soul.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.833
So in reality, we are your benefactors.

12:27.208 --> 12:29.249
You will be housed, you will be fed.

12:29.250 --> 12:32.499
All we ask is your cooperation.

12:32.500 --> 12:35.750
If you do your jobs, you
will have nothing to fear.

12:36.708 --> 12:38.707
You will be given postcards.

12:38.708 --> 12:41.374
Write to your relatives and friends

12:41.375 --> 12:44.207
to tell them you have arrived here safely.

12:44.208 --> 12:45.583
We will mail them for you.

12:46.500 --> 12:50.041
Unfortunately, there
have been reports that

12:50.042 --> 12:53.624
typhus have broken out
at several labour camps.

12:53.625 --> 12:56.291
We do not want typhus at Sobibor.

12:56.292 --> 13:00.249
Therefore, first you will be
taken to the shower facility

13:00.250 --> 13:02.957
where you will each have a hot shower.

13:02.958 --> 13:06.791
Naturally, men and women
will shower separately.

13:06.792 --> 13:10.124
Women will have their hair
cut short before they shower

13:10.125 --> 13:14.207
While you are showering, your
clothing will be disinfected.

13:14.208 --> 13:17.541
Remember, the better your behaviour,

13:17.542 --> 13:19.125
the easier your stay will be.

13:20.042 --> 13:23.292
Hauptscharfuhrer Wagner,
Oberscharfuhrer Frenzel.

13:26.625 --> 13:29.207
- I need experienced
shoemakers and tailors.

13:29.208 --> 13:31.374
- Is anybody an expert seamstress?

13:31.375 --> 13:34.124
Qualified seamstresses,
I want professionals.

13:34.125 --> 13:35.416
- Are there any
first class shoemakers?

13:35.417 --> 13:38.124
- Here, I am a seamstress.
- Any tailors?

13:38.125 --> 13:39.666
Any experienced shoemakers?

13:39.667 --> 13:41.791
- Where did you work, for how long?

13:41.792 --> 13:44.874
- In Warsaw for two,
no, two and half years

13:44.875 --> 13:46.999
in a clothing store, Belosky's.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.832
I did alterations.

13:48.833 --> 13:49.833
- Good, step forward.

13:49.834 --> 13:51.916
- Any tailors?
- I am a seamstress.

13:51.917 --> 13:52.917
- Step forward.

13:52.918 --> 13:55.999
- Are there any first class
shoemakers, any tailors?

13:56.000 --> 13:57.208
- I am a shoemaker, sir.

13:58.542 --> 14:00.041
The best.

14:00.042 --> 14:02.124
- Step forward.
- Qualified seamstresses?

14:02.125 --> 14:03.999
- Any experienced shoemakers?

14:04.000 --> 14:05.082
- Is anybody else a seamstress?

14:05.083 --> 14:06.791
- Tailors?

14:06.792 --> 14:08.707
- Qualified seamstresses?

14:08.708 --> 14:10.500
- Here, sir, I am a seamstress.

14:12.875 --> 14:15.166
- Is this your son?
- Yes, sir.

14:15.167 --> 14:16.583
- No, can't use you.

14:17.458 --> 14:20.332
- I am a seamstress, sir.
- Step forward.

14:20.333 --> 14:21.707
- Qualified seamstresses?

14:21.708 --> 14:24.749
- I need experienced
shoemakers, any tailors?

14:24.750 --> 14:26.500
- Sir, I am a goldsmith.

14:27.667 --> 14:29.583
See, I made that.

14:32.458 --> 14:33.667
These are my tools, sir.

14:34.875 --> 14:37.832
- Alright, step forward.

14:37.833 --> 14:41.457
- Oh, and sir, my brother,
he's a goldsmith too.

14:41.458 --> 14:42.458
He helps me.

14:43.208 --> 14:45.124
We can make jewellery, anything.

14:45.125 --> 14:46.167
- Seamstresses?

14:47.042 --> 14:49.582
- Alright, step forward.

14:49.583 --> 14:51.958
- Is anybody an expert seamstress?

14:53.208 --> 14:54.875
Qualified seamstresses?

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
- We'll see.
- Sir?

14:59.125 --> 15:01.166
What about our father?

15:01.167 --> 15:02.499
- Never mind him.

15:02.500 --> 15:03.874
- Seamstresses?
- Stay here, I'll be back.

15:03.875 --> 15:05.499
- Is anybody else a seamstress?

15:05.500 --> 15:07.832
- Any tailors?
- I'm a tailor, sir.

15:07.833 --> 15:10.124
- From where?
- Bialystock, sir.

15:10.125 --> 15:11.667
Very experienced, see?

15:13.250 --> 15:15.042
- Alright, step forward.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.083
Any more?

15:20.583 --> 15:23.250
- Women and children, follow me.

16:27.042 --> 16:28.792
- Men and boys, move!

17:02.708 --> 17:04.541
- Did you come here with your husband?

17:05.500 --> 17:06.666
- No, I'm not married.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.041
- My name is Bajle.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.499
- I'm Luka.

17:15.500 --> 17:16.999
- I'm Naomi.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.832
My husband is fighting with the partisans.

18:20.167 --> 18:21.833
- Come on, hurry up.

18:25.333 --> 18:26.583
- Get in.

18:30.375 --> 18:31.375
- I'm Samuel.

18:33.958 --> 18:34.958
Welcome.

18:36.417 --> 18:37.417
- I'm Itzhak.

18:44.417 --> 18:47.208
- We work here for the SS
and their Ukrainian guards

18:48.625 --> 18:50.999
- How did you know I was a shoemaker?

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
- I didn't.

18:53.292 --> 18:56.707
- But what if I'd been a
shopkeeper, or something?

18:56.708 --> 18:57.833
- I'd have taught you.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.458
It happens here all the time.

19:01.625 --> 19:03.500
- So why did you tell me to volunteer?

19:04.875 --> 19:07.207
- Because you like someone
I could get along with

19:07.208 --> 19:08.917
and that's important in Sobibor.

19:11.333 --> 19:12.500
Where do you come from?

19:14.208 --> 19:15.208
- Come on, come on.

19:19.625 --> 19:20.458
Come, come.

19:20.458 --> 19:21.458
Come in, come.

19:24.542 --> 19:25.624
Stop.

19:25.625 --> 19:27.499
Wait over there.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.582
- What do we do now?

19:39.583 --> 19:40.583
- He said to wait.

19:42.042 --> 19:43.208
Someone will tell us.

19:49.167 --> 19:50.167
- Shh, Shh.

19:52.417 --> 19:54.666
- They can't allow babies in here.

19:58.667 --> 19:59.667
- Help me.

20:08.875 --> 20:09.875
- Come.

20:18.167 --> 20:20.332
Stay in there, don't leave for any reason.

20:20.333 --> 20:22.500
That's Sergeant Wagner's
orders, understand?

20:39.417 --> 20:41.333
- Look, way over there.

20:42.208 --> 20:45.291
Looks like a fire, I wonder what it is.

20:45.292 --> 20:48.124
- If it looks like a fire,
then it probably is a fire.

20:48.125 --> 20:49.458
I sound like grandpa.

20:50.625 --> 20:53.332
- What could be burning?

20:53.333 --> 20:54.832
- Who knows.

21:20.958 --> 21:21.792
- What's happening?

21:21.793 --> 21:24.292
This isn't a normal roll call.

21:36.083 --> 21:37.500
- Complete.

21:38.625 --> 21:40.124
- Complete.

21:40.125 --> 21:41.166
- Complete.

21:41.167 --> 21:42.916
- Complete.
- Complete.

21:42.917 --> 21:43.917
- Complete.

21:45.417 --> 21:49.667
- The roll call is complete,
Herr Hauptscharfuhrer.

21:53.250 --> 21:56.332
- There's something you
don't seem to understand,

21:56.333 --> 21:59.457
so I'm going to explain it to you.

21:59.458 --> 22:03.625
Our commandant wants me
to make it very clear

22:05.375 --> 22:07.499
that he is responsible for you.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.999
For each and everyone of you here.

22:10.000 --> 22:14.500
Somewhat like, a large family.

22:16.750 --> 22:19.624
Today three members of that
family decided that they

22:19.625 --> 22:22.707
didn't want to be with us
this evening or ever again.

22:22.708 --> 22:27.292
Now, we could not let
that happen, could we?

22:58.625 --> 23:01.000
We have brought these
three foolish men back

23:03.250 --> 23:04.958
to be with all of us this evening.

23:06.792 --> 23:11.042
Understand the message these
three Jews brought back to you.

23:12.500 --> 23:15.042
There's no escape from Sobibor.

23:17.042 --> 23:19.875
There's only death for
those insane enough to try.

23:22.958 --> 23:25.125
Don't any of you ever forget that.

23:27.500 --> 23:28.999
Dismissed.

23:40.583 --> 23:42.707
- Leon, why didn't they listen to you?

23:42.708 --> 23:44.666
- They couldn't stand the pain anymore.

23:44.667 --> 23:47.374
- We talk about escape all
the time and we do nothing.

23:47.375 --> 23:48.499
Maybe it's true.

23:48.500 --> 23:49.333
Maybe there is no chance.

23:49.334 --> 23:52.041
- No, I still think there
is a way, but not like this.

23:52.042 --> 23:55.416
There has to be organization,
there has to be patience

23:55.417 --> 23:58.082
and some new people whose
spirits have not yet been broken.

23:58.083 --> 24:01.332
- Yes, I want a chance
to escape, to be free,

24:01.333 --> 24:03.082
or at least a chance to die trying.

24:03.083 --> 24:04.457
- Better to escape and live.

24:04.458 --> 24:06.292
That would be real revenge.

24:15.167 --> 24:16.167
- Hey, hey.

24:28.292 --> 24:30.832
- This is Commandant Reichleitner.

24:30.833 --> 24:32.458
Show the commandant your wallet.

24:35.750 --> 24:38.249
- This is very handsome, you made it?

24:38.250 --> 24:39.250
- Yes, sir.

24:40.542 --> 24:43.083
- SS, the initials are appropriate.

24:44.875 --> 24:45.999
What do they stand for?

24:46.000 --> 24:48.457
- My name, sir, Shlomo Szmajzner.

24:48.458 --> 24:49.999
- Can you make rings?
- Oh, yes sir.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.375
I can make, we can make
any kind of jewellery.

24:54.083 --> 24:56.374
- Show me what kind of monogram
you would design for me.

24:56.375 --> 24:58.125
- Yes, may I sit, sir?
- Yes, sit.

25:03.917 --> 25:06.417
- The initials, sir?
- FKR.

25:07.833 --> 25:09.958
Franz Karl Reichleitner.

25:33.458 --> 25:37.792
You can make that for me?
- Yes sir, but I need gold.

25:43.958 --> 25:45.375
- Is that enough?

25:46.958 --> 25:49.792
- See to it that these
boys get food and blankets.

25:50.750 --> 25:54.166
- Sir, our clothes, they're filthy.

25:54.167 --> 25:56.166
- Everything and everybody in Sobibor

25:56.167 --> 25:57.916
has to be neat and clean.

25:57.917 --> 26:00.166
Let them pick out what they
want at the sorting sheds.

26:00.167 --> 26:01.000
- Yes, Herr Commandant.

26:01.001 --> 26:03.124
- Oh, and sir,
my parents and sister--

26:03.125 --> 26:06.541
- Be quiet.
- No, no, let the boy talk.

26:06.542 --> 26:09.499
- My parents and my
sister came here with us.

26:09.500 --> 26:10.749
Please, sir, when can I see them?

26:10.750 --> 26:11.999
- Don't worry about them.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.541
They're working in the fields.

26:13.542 --> 26:15.249
They're well and happy.

26:15.250 --> 26:17.208
I promise you, soon you will join them.

26:42.500 --> 26:44.874
- How dare she hide the baby in here.

26:44.875 --> 26:46.082
We can all be killed for that.

26:46.083 --> 26:48.416
- You must get it out of here.

26:48.417 --> 26:50.374
- And put it where?

26:50.375 --> 26:52.999
What would you do if that was your baby?

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
- It's Wagner.

26:59.292 --> 27:00.458
- Good morning, ladies.

27:16.958 --> 27:19.291
I need someone who can
take care of rabbits.

27:19.292 --> 27:21.124
Does anyone here have experience?

27:21.125 --> 27:22.332
- I have.

27:22.333 --> 27:23.333
- Stand up.

27:25.417 --> 27:26.874
How did you learn?

27:26.875 --> 27:27.875
- At home.

27:28.750 --> 27:30.832
- We raised rabbits and chickens.

27:30.833 --> 27:31.833
My mother sold them at the market.

27:31.834 --> 27:33.083
- You have a new job.

27:34.458 --> 27:35.500
- Oberkapo, show her.

27:36.417 --> 27:37.417
- Come.

27:53.917 --> 27:57.999
Bit of advice, don't get Wagner angry.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.457
These Nazis can be
madmen, he is the worst.

28:01.458 --> 28:02.458
What is your name?

28:03.417 --> 28:04.417
- Luka.
- Luka.

28:05.333 --> 28:07.416
Well, Luka the woman who tended

28:07.417 --> 28:09.749
the rabbits twisted her
back a few days ago.

28:09.750 --> 28:11.166
We haven't seen her since.

28:11.167 --> 28:12.792
Sergeant Wagner arranged that.

28:13.958 --> 28:16.499
The rabbits are food for the SS.

28:16.500 --> 28:18.083
They love their Hasen-Pfeffer.

28:18.917 --> 28:20.792
You'd better know what you are doing.

28:22.083 --> 28:23.457
- Oberkapo?

28:23.458 --> 28:25.416
Does that mean you are in
charge of all the capos?

28:25.417 --> 28:27.332
- Yes.
- Are you Jewish?

28:27.333 --> 28:28.167
- All the capos are.

28:28.167 --> 28:29.167
There are only Jews here.

28:29.168 --> 28:31.249
- A Jew and you work for the Nazis?

28:31.250 --> 28:33.083
- I have no more choice than you do.

28:34.083 --> 28:35.583
- But you carry the whip.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.833
- Choose your clothes.

30:00.625 --> 30:02.666
- Esther, Kapo.

30:02.667 --> 30:04.541
- If they catch you
with that, you're dead.

30:04.542 --> 30:06.749
And they'll kill me too.

30:06.750 --> 30:08.166
So don't risk my life for me.

30:08.167 --> 30:09.749
I am risking it enough already,

30:09.750 --> 30:11.416
not turning you in right now.

30:11.417 --> 30:14.083
- I don't know how to thank you.

30:24.458 --> 30:25.874
- Where did all these clothes came from?

30:25.875 --> 30:28.041
- Quiet, no questions.

30:28.042 --> 30:29.583
You have what you need.

30:52.167 --> 30:53.374
- We'll talk about it later.

30:53.375 --> 30:56.082
I'll see you this evening.

30:56.083 --> 30:58.749
- Get back to work, you lazy scum!

30:58.750 --> 31:00.791
- Well said, Kapo.

31:00.792 --> 31:02.458
Now, give me your whip.

31:13.083 --> 31:14.125
Do your job.

31:19.958 --> 31:22.582
- Get off me, get off me.

31:22.583 --> 31:25.457
Get back to work, all of you!

31:25.458 --> 31:26.458
Go on!

31:27.542 --> 31:28.542
Go on!

32:19.250 --> 32:20.667
- Do you think...

32:22.500 --> 32:23.791
- Where are all the women and children?

32:23.792 --> 32:24.832
- Eda.

32:24.833 --> 32:25.833
Look.

32:27.333 --> 32:29.374
- How did you get this?

32:29.375 --> 32:31.749
That'll show 'em you bastard.

32:31.750 --> 32:32.583
- Got from the kitchen.

32:32.583 --> 32:33.583
Here, put it in the soup.

33:02.375 --> 33:04.625
- Good, yeah?
- Yeah, mm-hm.

33:06.625 --> 33:07.625
Hey, vodka.

33:13.042 --> 33:14.249
- Go on.

33:14.250 --> 33:16.832
Stuff you faces right in front of us.

33:16.833 --> 33:17.792
Shame on you.

33:17.793 --> 33:20.125
- Big bad Kapo Porchek.

33:21.125 --> 33:24.542
What guard did you bribe to get
food for you and your whore?

33:26.333 --> 33:28.666
- For your own good, shut up!

33:28.667 --> 33:30.874
- Give me that food.
- Hey, I'm warning you.

33:30.875 --> 33:31.833
Stop it.
- Give it to me.

33:31.833 --> 33:32.667
Give me.

33:32.668 --> 33:34.582
- Stop!
- Would you stop it?

33:34.583 --> 33:36.249
- Give it to me, give it.
- I said I'm warning you.

33:36.250 --> 33:37.250
- Stop!

33:42.625 --> 33:44.292
Why do we fight among ourselves?

33:47.458 --> 33:49.666
If we have energy to spend, let's spend it

33:49.667 --> 33:51.917
against those who have reduced us to this.

33:55.875 --> 33:56.875
- Wait.

34:04.792 --> 34:08.042
Here, let them share this.

34:13.167 --> 34:14.167
- Share it.

34:15.208 --> 34:16.373
- Thank you, Leon.

34:16.375 --> 34:18.498
- Excuse me, excuse me, are you Leon?

34:18.500 --> 34:19.998
- Yes.

34:20.000 --> 34:20.833
- I thought so.

34:20.833 --> 34:21.956
Samuel said I should see you.

34:21.958 --> 34:23.248
I am Itzhak Lichtman.

34:23.250 --> 34:25.206
- Oh yes, he told me about you.

34:25.208 --> 34:26.998
You're from Zolkiewka?
- Yes.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.206
- I have been there many times.

34:28.208 --> 34:29.208
- Ah.

34:29.875 --> 34:31.417
- Did you know the Rabbi there?

34:33.958 --> 34:34.875
- Rabbi Schmeitzher?

34:34.876 --> 34:37.417
- Yes, he was a close
friend of my father's.

34:38.917 --> 34:40.541
- Did you know they shot him?

34:40.542 --> 34:41.542
- No.

34:43.208 --> 34:44.500
- It was in the synagogue.

34:46.875 --> 34:48.542
During the service on Yom Kippur.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
I was there.

34:54.667 --> 34:55.667
- Let's go outside.

35:02.208 --> 35:03.292
- You found him, good.

35:07.083 --> 35:10.249
- Samuel and I are forming a small group.

35:10.250 --> 35:12.458
We have to select our
people very carefully.

35:14.875 --> 35:17.250
We're planning an escape.
- An escape?

35:18.583 --> 35:19.874
For how many?
- We don't know yet.

35:19.875 --> 35:22.791
10 people, perhaps 20 when
we work out the details,

35:22.792 --> 35:26.249
but whatever we say here--

35:26.250 --> 35:29.374
Whatever we say here must
be kept secret at all costs.

35:29.375 --> 35:30.292
- I swear to god.

35:30.293 --> 35:32.999
I'd rather die right here,
right now than betray you.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
- Good.

35:35.500 --> 35:37.874
- Can I bring my wife and my son?

35:37.875 --> 35:40.374
Can I bring him?
- How old is the boy?

35:40.375 --> 35:41.375
- Four.

35:43.458 --> 35:45.291
- When you saw your wife and child

35:45.292 --> 35:47.542
at the train station
last who were they with?

35:49.042 --> 35:50.082
- They were with all the other women

35:50.083 --> 35:52.249
and children going to the showers.

35:52.250 --> 35:53.458
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

35:58.875 --> 35:59.875
What is it?

36:02.833 --> 36:03.833
- Itzhak.
- What?

36:03.834 --> 36:05.042
- Listen to me.
- What?

36:06.333 --> 36:07.667
- This is a death camp.

36:08.958 --> 36:11.207
Every day a train comes.

36:11.208 --> 36:15.874
All the people, everyone who
goes to the showers is dead.

36:15.875 --> 36:18.999
Men, women, children, everyone.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
- Oh, god.

36:21.667 --> 36:23.833
Oh, god, oh, god, oh, god.

36:25.583 --> 36:29.999
Oh no.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.124
- Itzhak.
- Oh god.

36:32.125 --> 36:33.707
- Itzhak.

36:33.708 --> 36:34.708
- No.

36:35.542 --> 36:38.291
- The fire--
- Where?

36:38.292 --> 36:40.083
- The fire is their funeral.

36:45.208 --> 36:46.208
- Oh god.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
Oh no.

37:03.375 --> 37:06.541
- I think they're telling him.

37:06.542 --> 37:08.208
- They were my life.

38:30.500 --> 38:31.500
- Beautiful.

38:32.500 --> 38:33.999
That is excellent work.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.082
Excellent, isn't it?

38:35.083 --> 38:37.207
- Very handsome, Herr Commandant.

38:37.208 --> 38:39.416
- I expect you to design an SS ring.

38:39.417 --> 38:42.042
I want my SS men to have a nice gold ring.

38:42.958 --> 38:44.082
Start right away.

38:44.083 --> 38:45.083
- Yes, sir.

39:05.167 --> 39:06.167
- Bend over.

39:18.376 --> 39:21.292
Shlomo!

39:26.042 --> 39:27.625
- You are two lucky Jews.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
- Why, why?

39:41.375 --> 39:45.041
- Have you seen the new girl
in charge of the rabbits?

39:45.042 --> 39:46.457
- I've seen her.

39:46.458 --> 39:47.749
The Polack.

39:47.750 --> 39:50.416
I wouldn't mind having a
little of that right now.

39:50.417 --> 39:51.417
- With Jews?

39:52.125 --> 39:53.832
Well, that's disgusting.

39:53.833 --> 39:55.874
- If you saw her...

39:55.875 --> 39:58.916
- Remember Poul and Groth, two good men.

39:58.917 --> 40:00.332
Kicked out of the SS and sent to

40:00.333 --> 40:03.207
the Russian front for raping Jewish girls.

40:03.208 --> 40:04.999
- That didn't make sense to me.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.999
- Me neither, we are ordered to kill them,

40:07.000 --> 40:09.249
but we are not allowed to
use their bodies first.

40:09.250 --> 40:12.499
- No, as it should be,
we're SS, we're the elite.

40:12.500 --> 40:15.332
We do not foul ourselves on Jewish filth.

40:15.333 --> 40:17.083
- The British bombed Hamburg again.

40:17.917 --> 40:19.375
And again I'm lucky.

40:21.918 --> 40:24.291
My wife and kids are alright, thank god.

40:24.292 --> 40:26.250
- Just be glad you are in a safe place.

40:27.250 --> 40:30.666
Look at us, proud defenders of the Reich.

40:30.667 --> 40:32.124
- Don't talk like that.

40:32.125 --> 40:34.832
My father was killed in the first war.

40:34.833 --> 40:36.999
Doing his duty for the fatherland.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.541
And we are doing our
duty for the Fuhrer here.

40:40.583 --> 40:43.041
That's as honourable as
being on a battlefield.

40:43.042 --> 40:44.166
- He is right.

40:44.167 --> 40:46.792
- Battlefield, you're crazy.

40:48.875 --> 40:49.875
What do you do?

40:50.833 --> 40:53.791
Sit in your little booth
and turn on the gas?

40:53.792 --> 40:58.333
Valve on, wait 20 minutes, valve off.

40:59.500 --> 41:00.500
Big job.

41:01.750 --> 41:06.042
That takes great courage, Bauer.

41:07.500 --> 41:09.542
How many Jews did you gas today?

41:10.708 --> 41:12.542
- Don't talk about that in front of them.

41:14.292 --> 41:16.499
- They don't hear anything, do you?

41:16.500 --> 41:18.791
- I'm sorry, sir, I didn't hear you.

41:18.792 --> 41:20.917
- See, they are deaf.

41:22.042 --> 41:24.041
How old are you?
- 15, sir.

41:24.042 --> 41:25.042
-15?

41:25.750 --> 41:28.500
My son is 12, I hope he lives to be 15.

41:30.042 --> 41:31.999
I mean if a Jew can, why can't he?

41:32.000 --> 41:33.875
- What's your name?
- Toivi, sir.

41:35.292 --> 41:38.625
- Toivi, get me another beer.

41:39.833 --> 41:40.833
- Yes, sir.

41:45.958 --> 41:47.500
- Get this butcher out of here.

41:50.625 --> 41:52.499
- I've seen Treblinka.

41:52.500 --> 41:54.707
I don't know how they managed it.

41:54.708 --> 41:56.416
- Sloppy security, that's how.

41:56.417 --> 41:57.957
- Right, Herr Commandant.

41:57.958 --> 41:59.916
- If Jews at Treblinka can riot

41:59.917 --> 42:03.082
and set buildings on fire
then they can do it here.

42:03.083 --> 42:04.332
- Could they?

42:04.333 --> 42:06.416
- Not at Sobibor, Untersturmfuhrer.

42:06.417 --> 42:09.125
- But still I want extra
caution to be taken.

42:10.042 --> 42:12.207
I am advised by Berlin
that they are increasing

42:12.208 --> 42:16.207
the number of transports we
are to receive to three a day.

42:17.333 --> 42:19.791
A tribute to our efficiency.

42:19.792 --> 42:22.499
We'll be up to our eyes in Jews.

42:22.500 --> 42:24.707
Tell your men what happened at Treblinka.

42:24.708 --> 42:26.582
I expect you to see to it

42:26.583 --> 42:28.916
that nothing like that happens here.

42:28.917 --> 42:30.042
- Yes, Herr Commandant.

42:34.917 --> 42:36.082
- Can I help you, sir?

42:36.083 --> 42:39.083
- Here's a little present
for you, put it to work!

42:40.542 --> 42:43.082
Tell them your name.
- We know Toivi, sir.

42:43.083 --> 42:44.083
We can use him.

42:45.417 --> 42:47.500
Nobody asked you that.

42:54.333 --> 42:57.625
I want a design in gold on the handle.

42:58.583 --> 43:02.874
A snake that winds
around from here to here.

43:02.875 --> 43:04.832
- I'd be happy to do that for you, sir,

43:04.833 --> 43:06.457
but Sergeant Wagner,
he said that I wasn't--

43:06.458 --> 43:08.499
- I don't want to hear about
Hauptscharfuhrer Wagner,

43:08.500 --> 43:10.292
just do it or I'll break some bones.

43:12.125 --> 43:15.874
Understood?
- Yes, sir.

43:15.875 --> 43:18.291
- Send him to compound
three tomorrow morning.

43:18.292 --> 43:21.957
Ask for me at the gate, Scharfuhrer Bauer.

43:21.958 --> 43:23.666
I will have a gold piece,

43:23.667 --> 43:26.250
I want inserted at the
end of the handle here.

43:28.167 --> 43:29.167
- Yes, sir.

44:04.500 --> 44:05.500
- Look at this.

44:08.292 --> 44:09.292
- Thank you.

44:11.458 --> 44:15.292
- See, the skin is the
most nourishing part.

44:18.458 --> 44:20.542
I've put a piece in your soup too.

44:24.292 --> 44:25.292
Try it.

44:31.958 --> 44:33.333
You must eat.

44:34.875 --> 44:37.000
The best revenge is for you to survive.

44:40.083 --> 44:41.083
Itzhak.

44:41.958 --> 44:42.958
- Hm?

44:44.375 --> 44:46.792
- My family was murdered too.

45:03.958 --> 45:04.833
- Roll call in two minutes.

45:04.834 --> 45:06.166
Come on, quick.

45:06.167 --> 45:07.167
Come on.

45:08.583 --> 45:10.624
- All I'm saying, Leon,
is that maybe somehow

45:10.625 --> 45:11.832
we can use the Ukrainian guards.

45:11.833 --> 45:12.999
- It's possible.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.791
- How loyal are these
Ukrainians to the SS?

45:15.792 --> 45:17.624
- They hate the SS
as much as they hate us,

45:17.625 --> 45:20.749
but they're mercenaries and
also no one is shooting at them.

45:20.750 --> 45:22.041
- We use them all the time.

45:22.042 --> 45:24.582
When we find gold or
jewels in the sorting sheds

45:24.583 --> 45:26.541
we steal some of it sometimes and bribe

45:26.542 --> 45:28.291
the Ukrainian guards to bring us food.

45:28.292 --> 45:30.332
They get rich but at least we stay alive.

45:30.333 --> 45:31.250
- What's your idea?

45:31.251 --> 45:33.832
- Look, suppose we find
the right Ukrainian,

45:33.833 --> 45:35.249
we bribe him to bring us poison.

45:35.250 --> 45:36.707
Strychnine, cyanide.

45:36.708 --> 45:38.249
- Alright, we have the poison, then What?

45:38.250 --> 45:40.207
- Well, who serves the SS meals?

45:40.208 --> 45:41.167
The butchers.

45:41.168 --> 45:42.707
We get them to do the poisoning.

45:42.708 --> 45:44.166
- They're children, Samuel.

45:44.167 --> 45:45.916
It's too much responsibility for them.

45:45.917 --> 45:46.957
- You're right.

45:46.958 --> 45:48.749
The problem is we're not soldiers.

45:48.750 --> 45:50.291
We don't know how to kill, we never have.

45:50.292 --> 45:53.082
Roll call, come on.

45:53.083 --> 45:58.083
- Roll call, come on.

46:12.542 --> 46:14.292
- Sergeant Bauer wants me.

47:22.875 --> 47:23.708
- What are you doing?

47:23.709 --> 47:24.957
You're not allowed in here.

47:24.958 --> 47:29.958
- Sergeant Bauer ordered me here, sir.

47:33.917 --> 47:34.917
- Wait here.

48:18.792 --> 48:19.875
- No, no, no!

48:46.750 --> 48:48.957
- What's taking Moses so long?

48:48.958 --> 48:50.083
- Maybe he got lost.

48:57.667 --> 48:59.833
- No, here he is.

49:03.250 --> 49:07.166
Moses, Moses, Moses, what happened?

49:07.167 --> 49:08.125
Did someone hurt you?

49:08.125 --> 49:08.958
- No.

49:08.959 --> 49:10.666
- Well, what
is it, what happened?

49:10.667 --> 49:11.916
Tell us.

49:11.917 --> 49:15.833
- I went there to get
this from sergeant Bauer.

49:16.667 --> 49:18.957
- Yes, I know that.

49:18.958 --> 49:21.666
- I saw the shower place.

49:21.667 --> 49:23.291
And there are no showers

49:23.292 --> 49:26.958
'Cause all the people who
go in there, are killed.

49:28.875 --> 49:30.292
I saw the dead bodies.

49:31.875 --> 49:34.667
Women, babies.

49:35.583 --> 49:40.583
All twisted together,
and prisoners like us

49:41.250 --> 49:44.374
throw them on carts and pull them away.

49:44.375 --> 49:48.667
Everyone who goes for a shower is dead.

49:50.417 --> 49:54.000
Everyone, Shlomo, our
whole family is dead.

50:04.708 --> 50:06.249
- You knew this.

50:06.250 --> 50:08.749
You knew and you didn't tell us.

50:08.750 --> 50:10.916
- My family are dead too.

50:10.917 --> 50:15.707
The sergeants, they said if I
told anyone, they'd kill me.

50:15.708 --> 50:20.708
- Our mother, our father
and our sister are murdered.

50:23.833 --> 50:25.083
Now I want to kill.

50:26.000 --> 50:27.417
And I will kill.

50:39.208 --> 50:40.999
- Yes, it's lovely for his health.

50:41.000 --> 50:42.791
But you cannot survive here without God.

50:42.792 --> 50:45.416
- To survive--
- Which one of you is Leon?

50:45.417 --> 50:46.749
- I am.

50:46.750 --> 50:48.457
You are the new goldsmith.

50:48.458 --> 50:50.041
- Shlomo.
- Yes, hello Shlomo.

50:50.042 --> 50:51.333
- What's going on in here?

50:52.625 --> 50:54.082
How can you do this in a place

50:54.083 --> 50:55.666
where they murder your families?

50:55.667 --> 50:57.207
They kill little children.
- Shh, shh.

50:57.208 --> 50:59.291
- And you make music, you laugh,

50:59.292 --> 51:01.416
you play games, you even make love.

51:01.417 --> 51:03.041
In here, it's a carnival.

51:03.042 --> 51:04.874
And you work for these monsters.

51:04.875 --> 51:07.374
You packet our clothing
to send to Germany.

51:07.375 --> 51:09.417
My mother's clothing, my father's--

51:14.500 --> 51:16.624
- Now that you know
the truth about Sobibor

51:16.625 --> 51:18.500
will you still make jewellery for them?

51:19.750 --> 51:21.708
What will you do, refuse?

51:23.042 --> 51:25.207
Consider yourself an honoured person

51:25.208 --> 51:27.207
because you let them kill you?

51:27.208 --> 51:30.124
No, you won't, as we don't.

51:30.125 --> 51:33.625
And every day will be
an agony of conscience.

51:37.542 --> 51:39.458
It's the same for everybody here.

51:40.583 --> 51:44.041
When I came here, I was with
my wife and small child.

51:44.042 --> 51:46.166
They took me to work in the sorting shed.

51:46.167 --> 51:48.332
My wife and child were
sent to the showers.

51:48.333 --> 51:52.250
The next day I am sorting
through clothes, and I, I come...

51:57.250 --> 51:59.082
I came across their clothes.

51:59.083 --> 52:00.374
I find them by accident.

52:00.375 --> 52:02.041
This is the way I find that they are dead.

52:02.042 --> 52:03.542
My wife, my child.

52:06.500 --> 52:08.667
But what is there to do but survive?

52:10.708 --> 52:12.749
Yes, we sing and we dance.

52:12.750 --> 52:16.166
Sometimes we make jokes, we make love.

52:16.167 --> 52:18.167
If not, we deny life.

52:19.958 --> 52:22.291
We work for them so we may survive.

52:22.292 --> 52:24.374
And we survive for a reason.

52:24.375 --> 52:25.375
Revenge.

52:26.958 --> 52:28.625
And some day we will have it.

52:30.542 --> 52:31.542
Do you understand?

52:32.375 --> 52:34.167
- I will do anything for revenge.

52:35.083 --> 52:36.708
Even if I have to die for it.

52:38.000 --> 52:39.166
- How old are you?

52:39.167 --> 52:41.999
- How old do you have to be?

52:42.000 --> 52:43.667
- You're old enough.

53:08.625 --> 53:11.583
- Wagner's going to be
late on his round today.

53:14.000 --> 53:14.833
No he isn't.

53:14.833 --> 53:15.833
Here he comes.

53:26.000 --> 53:27.917
- Good morning, ladies.

53:29.333 --> 53:31.750
And how is the work
progressing this morning?

53:48.292 --> 53:49.333
- No, please.

53:50.208 --> 53:51.208
- Is that yours?

53:52.042 --> 53:53.375
- What are you going to do?

53:54.833 --> 53:56.957
- What do you think?

53:56.958 --> 53:59.375
There are no babies in Sobibor.

54:10.792 --> 54:11.792
- No!

54:13.125 --> 54:14.791
No.

54:14.792 --> 54:15.625
You're going to kill her?

54:15.626 --> 54:16.999
- Because I am in a good mood today,

54:17.000 --> 54:19.207
I'm going to let you live.

54:19.208 --> 54:20.457
- No.

54:20.458 --> 54:21.292
- I really shouldn't.

54:21.293 --> 54:22.791
You're a lucky woman.

54:22.792 --> 54:24.791
- Give me my baby.

54:34.000 --> 54:35.166
- You don't understand.

54:35.167 --> 54:37.707
I'm offering you a chance to live.

54:37.708 --> 54:39.083
It's quite unusual.

54:42.792 --> 54:46.208
- I spit on your offer, you Nazi bastard.

55:07.292 --> 55:08.792
- We got to get out of here.

55:10.333 --> 55:11.333
We got to get out.

55:13.708 --> 55:16.999
But even if we do, even if
we do escape, what then?

55:17.000 --> 55:19.124
- We disappear into the forest.

55:19.125 --> 55:20.499
There are partisan groups there.

55:20.500 --> 55:22.542
We find these groups and we join them.

55:23.667 --> 55:25.416
But first things first.

55:25.417 --> 55:27.417
We must find a way of escaping.

55:35.042 --> 55:37.416
- This should be one of our easier days.

55:37.417 --> 55:39.208
These Dutch will behave themselves.

55:54.667 --> 55:56.083
- I'll take this.

55:58.667 --> 56:01.749
Here, be sure to keep your baggage check.

56:01.750 --> 56:04.000
- Thank you, just a second.

56:08.875 --> 56:10.666
Here you are.

56:10.667 --> 56:12.874
- We're not allowed to accept tips, madam.

56:12.875 --> 56:14.957
- Nonsense, please, take it.

56:14.958 --> 56:15.792
- I can't.

56:15.793 --> 56:20.792
- Well, then only as a
souvenir from Holland.

56:20.917 --> 56:23.957
Are there any other Dutch
people already here?

56:23.958 --> 56:26.207
- No, this is the first
train from Holland.

56:26.208 --> 56:31.208
- Hurry up, please.

56:43.292 --> 56:46.124
- Here is your baggage
check, don't lose it.

56:46.125 --> 56:49.124
- Thank you, I won't.

56:49.125 --> 56:49.958
- When they ask for seamstresses

56:49.959 --> 56:51.541
or laundresses just raise your hand.

56:51.542 --> 56:53.916
Whatever it is, say you're a professional.

56:53.917 --> 56:55.333
- Why?
- Just do it.

57:28.375 --> 57:30.750
- Look at the SS, they're amused.

57:33.708 --> 57:35.041
Bastards.

57:35.042 --> 57:36.707
- Not only do we die for them,

57:36.708 --> 57:39.375
we dance for them like
stupid performing bears.

57:45.542 --> 57:46.708
- That was charming.

57:47.917 --> 57:49.166
A lovely folk dance.

57:49.167 --> 57:51.208
- Thank you.
- Very charming.

57:52.667 --> 57:55.792
Now, everybody dance, play.

58:01.458 --> 58:03.957
I want you all to have a good time.

58:03.958 --> 58:04.958
Come on.

58:06.708 --> 58:07.708
Dance.

58:08.958 --> 58:10.792
Enjoy it, let's dance.

58:12.750 --> 58:14.125
Let's dance, come on, dance.

58:16.542 --> 58:17.708
- May I have the honour?

58:23.417 --> 58:26.124
- Let's dance, come on.

58:26.125 --> 58:27.125
Come on.

58:30.750 --> 58:31.750
- Hello, Bajle.

58:35.708 --> 58:36.708
- Hello.

58:38.833 --> 58:40.291
- You dance beautifully.

58:40.292 --> 58:41.292
- Thank you.

58:43.250 --> 58:45.582
- You came to Sobibor alone?

58:45.583 --> 58:46.583
- Yes.

58:47.667 --> 58:49.667
- Where are your family?

58:51.000 --> 58:54.041
- I don't know where they are.

58:54.042 --> 58:55.749
I'm by myself.

58:55.750 --> 58:57.417
- And I'm by myself.

59:08.250 --> 59:11.250
My name is Chaim.
- I'm Selma, hello.

59:12.458 --> 59:13.458
- Hello.

59:15.583 --> 59:18.750
Would you dance with me?
- Oh, I would.

59:21.542 --> 59:23.958
- Come on, come on.

59:26.042 --> 59:28.457
- You look like you want to dance.

59:28.458 --> 59:30.792
- Yes, but I don't know how.

59:32.500 --> 59:34.083
- Would you like me to show you?

59:36.167 --> 59:37.167
- But no laughing.

59:38.750 --> 59:40.167
- Well, maybe just a little.

59:45.125 --> 59:47.957
- Let's dance, come on.

59:47.958 --> 59:49.541
Come on.

59:49.542 --> 59:51.332
Let's dance.

59:51.333 --> 59:52.167
Enjoy it.

59:52.168 --> 59:53.749
- One, two three, one, two, three.

59:53.750 --> 59:59.207
One, two three, one, two, three.

59:59.208 --> 01:00:01.082
One, two three.

01:00:01.083 --> 01:00:03.583
- I keep seeing people
coming to you for advice.

01:00:04.667 --> 01:00:06.917
- We talk, it passes the time.

01:00:10.833 --> 01:00:15.125
- Whatever it is, if I can
ever help, just say so.

01:00:16.292 --> 01:00:18.375
- Bajle, I don't know how

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:23.208
to say things like this, but I want you.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.666
- Let me tell you, you do know
how to say things like that.

01:00:31.667 --> 01:00:34.000
Shlomo, I'm 26.

01:00:35.125 --> 01:00:37.208
Why don't you ask one
of the younger girls?

01:00:38.625 --> 01:00:40.916
- If I'd never eaten an apple before

01:00:40.917 --> 01:00:42.333
I wouldn't want a green one.

01:00:45.417 --> 01:00:48.125
Bajle, when?

01:00:52.625 --> 01:00:53.625
- We'll see.

01:01:13.167 --> 01:01:14.667
- Wagner's coming.

01:01:21.875 --> 01:01:23.125
- Keep working.

01:01:26.542 --> 01:01:28.624
When will the SS rings be finished?

01:01:28.625 --> 01:01:31.457
- We'll finish the last ones today, sir.

01:01:31.458 --> 01:01:33.082
- I have orders from
Commandant Reichleitner

01:01:33.083 --> 01:01:34.457
to close down the goldsmith shop

01:01:34.458 --> 01:01:35.292
when all the rings are done.

01:01:35.293 --> 01:01:36.749
- Why?

01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:37.958
- It doesn't matter why.

01:01:40.083 --> 01:01:41.791
Now listen to me.

01:01:41.792 --> 01:01:43.207
I'm making you the head
of the mechanics shop.

01:01:43.208 --> 01:01:44.957
You'll have four or five men

01:01:44.958 --> 01:01:46.582
under you and a lot of hard work.

01:01:46.583 --> 01:01:49.708
If you want to live, you'll
see that it's done right.

01:01:51.125 --> 01:01:52.999
You can take that one with you.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.249
What's his name?
- Moses.

01:01:55.250 --> 01:01:56.250
- Ah.

01:01:58.625 --> 01:02:00.042
The king of Jews.

01:02:02.833 --> 01:02:04.582
You will work and sleep
in the mechanics shop

01:02:04.583 --> 01:02:07.499
and at night, in secret, you'll continue

01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:10.916
to make gold jewellery for me
and for whoever I send to you.

01:02:10.917 --> 01:02:15.042
Remember, if this secret
leaks you and the little king

01:02:16.042 --> 01:02:17.792
will be dead five minutes later.

01:02:18.792 --> 01:02:19.957
Understood?

01:02:19.958 --> 01:02:20.958
- Yes.

01:02:25.708 --> 01:02:28.208
- Sir, what about Toivi, sir?

01:02:29.542 --> 01:02:31.499
- You better find yourself another job.

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:32.583
- What other job, sir?

01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:37.833
- Any other job!

01:03:28.292 --> 01:03:29.125
- Get up, get up.

01:03:29.125 --> 01:03:30.125
Get up!

01:03:31.083 --> 01:03:32.083
Alright.

01:03:34.083 --> 01:03:35.292
25 for you.

01:03:36.917 --> 01:03:38.458
And don't forget to count.

01:03:39.583 --> 01:03:44.583
One, two, three, four, five.

01:03:49.042 --> 01:03:51.375
Six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

01:03:57.792 --> 01:03:58.792
11,12.

01:04:00.542 --> 01:04:03.958
13, 14.

01:04:21.417 --> 01:04:22.667
- Kapo.

01:04:25.958 --> 01:04:27.458
Hurry up, move it.

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:30.124
Move along.

01:04:30.125 --> 01:04:32.375
- Here, you, get the water.

01:04:38.125 --> 01:04:40.624
- Got a light?
- I think so.

01:04:40.625 --> 01:04:42.000
You two, wait.

01:04:43.667 --> 01:04:47.166
- Now?
- At the stream, I'II hit him.

01:04:47.167 --> 01:04:49.000
- Alright, go ahead, move.

01:05:04.333 --> 01:05:05.874
- What's taking them so long?

01:05:05.875 --> 01:05:06.708
- I don't know.

01:05:06.709 --> 01:05:08.792
- Stay here, I'll have a look.

01:05:28.208 --> 01:05:29.249
Scharfuhrer!

01:05:29.250 --> 01:05:30.667
Scharfuhrer Wolf!

01:05:32.167 --> 01:05:35.457
Two prisoners escaped at the stream.

01:05:35.458 --> 01:05:36.749
They have a rifle.

01:05:36.750 --> 01:05:39.332
- You, you, you and you follow me.

01:05:39.333 --> 01:05:40.333
Come on.

01:05:43.125 --> 01:05:44.332
- They got out.

01:05:44.333 --> 01:05:46.416
Let's go.

01:05:46.417 --> 01:05:47.417
Go.

01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:42.000
- Stand at attention.

01:06:46.042 --> 01:06:48.667
This morning two prisoners
escaped from North Camp,

01:06:49.833 --> 01:06:53.374
13 other prisoners, no doubt inspired by

01:06:53.375 --> 01:06:57.042
that idiotic example also tried to escape.

01:06:58.708 --> 01:07:02.042
If any of you would like
to cheer, go right ahead.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.374
There will be no more escape
attempts in this camp.

01:07:08.375 --> 01:07:10.749
I'll repeat that, there will be

01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:13.417
no more escape attempts in this camp!

01:07:15.375 --> 01:07:19.250
We're going to kill these
13 men while you watch.

01:07:20.625 --> 01:07:22.500
But we're going to do more than that.

01:07:23.792 --> 01:07:26.832
We're going to allow each of these men

01:07:26.833 --> 01:07:29.792
the privilege of selecting one of you

01:07:30.833 --> 01:07:32.250
as his partner in death.

01:07:33.417 --> 01:07:35.833
26 will die today.

01:07:42.625 --> 01:07:44.042
Go and select your partners.

01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:50.208
You're all free to walk over
and select your partners.

01:07:51.458 --> 01:07:52.458
Do it now.

01:07:55.542 --> 01:07:57.917
I said, do it now.

01:08:00.792 --> 01:08:01.792
Do it now!

01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:06.874
- No, none of us will do it.

01:08:06.875 --> 01:08:08.542
We will never do it.

01:08:12.667 --> 01:08:13.667
- Let me explain.

01:08:14.875 --> 01:08:16.750
This is simple mathematics.

01:08:17.750 --> 01:08:20.082
So it shouldn't be too
difficult to understand.

01:08:21.542 --> 01:08:25.832
If you 13 men do not select 13 to die

01:08:25.832 --> 01:08:30.332
with you then I will select 50.

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:35.125
So the decision is yours.

01:08:37.542 --> 01:08:40.667
13 or 50.

01:09:05.417 --> 01:09:06.417
- I'm sorry.

01:10:45.708 --> 01:10:47.125
- And now we begin.

01:10:48.458 --> 01:10:52.125
You will watch this, so
that you will remember.

01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:57.542
If I find anyone turning
away or closing their eyes

01:11:00.250 --> 01:11:04.167
then that person will join
these 26 who are about to die.

01:11:14.292 --> 01:11:18.625
Scharfuhrer Fallaster.
- Yes Hauptscharfuhrer Wagner.

01:11:20.292 --> 01:11:21.292
Take your positions.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.000
- Avenge us!

01:11:28.833 --> 01:11:31.250
- Fire.

01:11:45.875 --> 01:11:47.707
- Enough time off now.

01:11:47.708 --> 01:11:48.875
Everyone back to work.

01:11:59.542 --> 01:12:01.666
- Tell the others.

01:12:01.667 --> 01:12:03.916
We meet in your shop tonight.

01:12:03.917 --> 01:12:04.917
Eight o'clock.

01:12:13.250 --> 01:12:15.083
There's something we have to discuss.

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:20.500
We've been planning an escape
for a small number of people,

01:12:21.917 --> 01:12:24.541
but you saw what happened today
when 13 men tried to escape.

01:12:24.542 --> 01:12:26.208
The same thing will happen again.

01:12:27.458 --> 01:12:31.582
We can not leave hundreds
behind to be slaughtered.

01:12:31.583 --> 01:12:33.457
And they would be.

01:12:33.458 --> 01:12:36.249
Therefore, the escape we plan must

01:12:36.250 --> 01:12:38.250
be for every prisoner in Sobibor.

01:12:42.792 --> 01:12:43.792
- Everyone?

01:12:45.708 --> 01:12:47.749
Even the workers in camp three?

01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:49.458
- Yes, all 600.

01:12:50.542 --> 01:12:51.542
Or else no one.

01:12:52.458 --> 01:12:54.207
- But that's impossible.

01:12:54.208 --> 01:12:57.999
I mean, how can we get
600 people out of here?

01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.666
- I believe there is a way.

01:12:59.667 --> 01:13:01.749
And I believe that we must find it.

01:13:01.750 --> 01:13:02.874
- Leon is right.

01:13:02.875 --> 01:13:05.708
It is an incredible idea, 600 people.

01:13:06.667 --> 01:13:10.416
Everyone in Sobibor must
have a chance to be free.

01:13:10.417 --> 01:13:12.125
- There is no other choice.

01:13:16.833 --> 01:13:17.833
Shlomo?

01:13:20.208 --> 01:13:21.208
Morris?

01:13:24.292 --> 01:13:25.292
Mundek?

01:13:27.625 --> 01:13:28.625
Itzhak?

01:13:30.375 --> 01:13:32.249
Good, then we are agreed.

01:13:32.250 --> 01:13:35.832
Alright, let's put our minds

01:13:35.833 --> 01:13:38.042
to discovering what this plan should be.

01:13:39.208 --> 01:13:41.958
There is one if we can just find it.

01:13:45.875 --> 01:13:46.999
- What about this?

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.249
We build 30 ladders in my carpenter shop.

01:13:50.250 --> 01:13:52.667
They should be maybe 12 foot long.

01:13:53.542 --> 01:13:54.750
This is perfect.

01:13:55.583 --> 01:13:58.791
On a dark night we rush the fence.

01:13:58.792 --> 01:14:00.499
20 people go with each ladder.

01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:01.666
Zip, zip, zip, zip.

01:14:01.667 --> 01:14:05.416
In no time, that's 600 people.

01:14:05.417 --> 01:14:06.417
- Even if you could build it,

01:14:06.418 --> 01:14:08.749
where would we hide the ladders?

01:14:08.750 --> 01:14:10.082
- Make it 20 ladders.

01:14:10.083 --> 01:14:11.999
30 people over each.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.749
We'll find a place to hide them somewhere.

01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:16.082
I don't know.

01:14:16.083 --> 01:14:19.833
- And what about the
minefields outside the fence?

01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:23.707
It won't work, Morris.

01:14:23.708 --> 01:14:25.166
- That's alright, Morris, keep thinking.

01:14:25.167 --> 01:14:26.832
Every idea may be the right one.

01:14:26.833 --> 01:14:27.750
- Let's talk about a tunnel.

01:14:27.751 --> 01:14:32.249
- Itzhak, it would have to
be at least 50 yards long.

01:14:32.250 --> 01:14:34.707
But how could we do that?
- It doesn't matter.

01:14:34.708 --> 01:14:37.249
Let's say we can dig this
tunnel and hide the dirt.

01:14:37.250 --> 01:14:39.457
Then suppose we start
the escape at midnight

01:14:39.458 --> 01:14:41.541
and give each of our 600 people one minute

01:14:41.542 --> 01:14:43.082
to get through the tunnel, crawl through

01:14:43.083 --> 01:14:44.124
and escape into the woods.

01:14:44.125 --> 01:14:46.832
One minute, which is
impossible, but never mind,

01:14:46.833 --> 01:14:49.457
that adds up to 600 minutes, 10 hours.

01:14:49.458 --> 01:14:51.791
We'd still be escaping at
10 o'clock in the morning.

01:14:51.792 --> 01:14:53.832
- Well, we have to come
up with a real plan soon.

01:14:53.833 --> 01:14:56.500
- It's there, we can find it.

01:14:57.417 --> 01:15:00.500
We'll meet again tomorrow.

01:15:35.417 --> 01:15:36.750
- Parade, march.

01:15:47.708 --> 01:15:49.125
Stop, halt march!

01:16:00.625 --> 01:16:02.624
- Russian soldiers.

01:16:02.625 --> 01:16:04.624
- What are they doing here?

01:16:04.625 --> 01:16:07.041
- They should be in a
prisoner of war camp.

01:16:07.042 --> 01:16:09.042
Maybe they're all Jews.
- Maybe.

01:16:23.667 --> 01:16:25.499
- You wanted to know about the Russians.

01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:27.332
They are all Jewish.

01:16:27.333 --> 01:16:29.667
They're here to do heavy
labour in the North Camp.

01:16:31.292 --> 01:16:32.292
- Thanks.

01:16:34.750 --> 01:16:36.082
See if their officer will meet me

01:16:36.083 --> 01:16:38.207
in the women's barracks tonight.

01:16:38.208 --> 01:16:39.042
- I don't know what is going on,

01:16:39.043 --> 01:16:41.083
but whatever it is, I wish you good luck.

01:17:10.333 --> 01:17:11.499
- No, no, no, no.

01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:13.624
Now, we'll just see what he's like.

01:17:13.625 --> 01:17:15.791
Let's find out if he'll trust us.

01:17:15.792 --> 01:17:17.125
- Or Whether we trust him.

01:17:19.208 --> 01:17:21.291
- Civilians and soldiers, Russians,

01:17:21.292 --> 01:17:23.042
Poles trusting each other.

01:17:23.875 --> 01:17:25.457
I don't know.

01:17:25.458 --> 01:17:27.875
Well, we have to try.

01:17:29.083 --> 01:17:30.708
- Supposing they escape?

01:17:32.208 --> 01:17:34.125
- If they escape, we'll pay for it.

01:17:40.583 --> 01:17:43.791
Lieutenant, I am Leon Feldhendler.

01:17:43.792 --> 01:17:45.249
- Alexander Pechersky.

01:17:45.250 --> 01:17:47.249
- This is Samuel Freiberg.

01:17:47.250 --> 01:17:49.332
- A pleasure, lieutenant Perchersky.

01:17:49.333 --> 01:17:50.916
- Everyone calls me Sasha.

01:17:50.917 --> 01:17:52.832
It saves time and energy.

01:17:52.833 --> 01:17:53.708
- Thank you.

01:17:53.709 --> 01:17:54.916
We would like very much to know

01:17:54.917 --> 01:17:56.374
what's happening in the outside world.

01:17:56.375 --> 01:17:57.916
Would you tell us?

01:17:57.917 --> 01:17:58.750
- Of course.

01:17:58.751 --> 01:18:00.207
- What's happening in the war?

01:18:02.875 --> 01:18:04.416
- Please, please.

01:18:04.417 --> 01:18:06.416
- How far away is your army?

01:18:06.417 --> 01:18:10.167
We are between six and 700 miles away.

01:18:11.125 --> 01:18:14.457
We are beating back the Nazis,
but it is a slow process.

01:18:14.458 --> 01:18:15.666
- Are there partisans nearby?

01:18:15.667 --> 01:18:16.916
Could they help us?

01:18:16.917 --> 01:18:19.083
- They have many things to do.

01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:24.458
I'm afraid here, we must help ourselves.

01:18:32.625 --> 01:18:34.625
Let us be open with each other.

01:18:35.917 --> 01:18:37.749
You did not ask me here just to be

01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:39.707
friendly with the Russian soldiers.

01:18:39.708 --> 01:18:40.708
- No.

01:18:41.833 --> 01:18:43.457
- So what do you want of us?

01:18:43.458 --> 01:18:45.416
- To see if we can trust each other.

01:18:45.417 --> 01:18:47.541
- Curfew, curfew!

01:18:47.542 --> 01:18:49.000
- Why should I trust you?

01:18:51.458 --> 01:18:52.957
- We are two Jews in a death camp.

01:18:52.958 --> 01:18:54.582
Perhaps, together we can devise a way

01:18:54.583 --> 01:18:57.332
of surviving past what
they have planned for us.

01:18:57.333 --> 01:18:59.249
- We must get back to the barracks.

01:18:59.250 --> 01:19:00.582
- They lock them at 10.

01:19:00.583 --> 01:19:03.707
Goodnight, Leon.

01:19:03.708 --> 01:19:04.874
- Goodnight, Sasha.

01:19:04.875 --> 01:19:06.292
- Samuel.
- Goodnight.

01:19:09.875 --> 01:19:11.416
- He wants us to trust him.

01:19:11.417 --> 01:19:12.958
- To do what?

01:19:14.333 --> 01:19:16.332
- I do not know for sure.

01:19:16.333 --> 01:19:17.333
- An escape?

01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:20.167
- Hm, maybe.

01:19:21.125 --> 01:19:22.458
- Why do we need civilians?

01:19:23.333 --> 01:19:24.333
We are soldiers.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.542
We can handle it ourselves.

01:19:27.542 --> 01:19:28.917
He's trying to use us.

01:19:30.958 --> 01:19:34.375
- He knows this place.

01:19:35.292 --> 01:19:38.500
Maybe we should use him to get out.

01:19:46.375 --> 01:19:47.375
- Come on.

01:19:48.042 --> 01:19:49.042
Faster.

01:19:57.083 --> 01:19:58.917
Wait, wait, just wait.

01:20:04.625 --> 01:20:05.999
- Are you ready?

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.124
- Almost, sir.

01:20:07.125 --> 01:20:10.499
- Wrong, you're ready now.

01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:12.667
You've got 10 minutes
got to everybody fed.

01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:15.041
There's extra work today.

01:20:15.042 --> 01:20:16.125
Start serving.

01:20:51.625 --> 01:20:54.791
10 minutes.
- We're trying, sir.

01:20:54.792 --> 01:20:56.582
- But not hard enough.

01:21:19.625 --> 01:21:22.749
- Don't, they will kill you.

01:21:22.750 --> 01:21:24.291
- Alright, enough.

01:21:24.292 --> 01:21:26.082
Kapos get these people off to work.

01:21:46.458 --> 01:21:48.750
- I have a great deal
of work planned for you.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:10.541
Move out, all of you, do it now!

01:22:15.125 --> 01:22:16.083
- Be careful.

01:22:16.084 --> 01:22:18.833
They only need us as long as
the trains keep coming in.

01:22:22.083 --> 01:22:23.167
We must escape.

01:22:24.792 --> 01:22:27.624
- Yes, escape, for how many?

01:22:27.625 --> 01:22:30.917
- All 600, every prisoner in Sobibor.

01:22:32.167 --> 01:22:34.041
- The whole camp?

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.667
- [Frenzel Move out!

01:22:47.833 --> 01:22:51.542
- The more people who
know of an escape plan

01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:55.124
the less chance of success.

01:22:55.125 --> 01:22:56.125
- Yes, of course.

01:22:56.126 --> 01:22:58.166
That's why it is absolutely essential

01:22:58.167 --> 01:23:00.999
that it will remain a secret
until the last minute.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.291
Then everyone must get a chance.

01:23:03.292 --> 01:23:06.666
- I will need a detailed
map of the entire camp.

01:23:06.667 --> 01:23:07.832
- We can get that for you.

01:23:07.833 --> 01:23:09.957
We can also get you a fairly good map

01:23:09.958 --> 01:23:11.958
of the minefields outside the camp.

01:23:12.833 --> 01:23:14.499
- Minefield?

01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:15.916
- Minefield.

01:23:15.917 --> 01:23:17.166
Except for the front gate,

01:23:17.167 --> 01:23:19.417
it runs all around the
perimeter of the camp.

01:23:21.375 --> 01:23:24.957
You see how terrified they are of us.

01:23:27.917 --> 01:23:31.416
- Also, I need to know
everything you can tell me

01:23:31.417 --> 01:23:34.291
about the SS and the Ukrainian guards.

01:23:34.292 --> 01:23:37.041
How many, what they do.

01:23:37.042 --> 01:23:38.416
- We can get that for you.

01:23:38.417 --> 01:23:42.707
- Now, the two of us can
not be seen every night,

01:23:42.708 --> 01:23:45.166
alone, talking together.

01:23:45.167 --> 01:23:48.417
How can we meet without causing suspicion?

01:23:49.458 --> 01:23:51.792
- Well the SS is used to see me here.

01:23:55.250 --> 01:23:56.707
Perhaps if you had a girlfriend,

01:23:56.708 --> 01:23:58.582
you would come and visit her every night.

01:23:58.583 --> 01:24:00.166
That would look normal to them.

01:24:00.167 --> 01:24:02.624
I think we'd better get you a woman.

01:24:02.625 --> 01:24:05.249
It's got to be somebody
completely trustworthy.

01:24:05.250 --> 01:24:06.667
Give me 24 hours.

01:24:35.042 --> 01:24:37.082
- Where's your brother?

01:24:37.083 --> 01:24:41.000
- He's sleeping
in the carpenter shop.

01:25:01.250 --> 01:25:03.125
- How did you know to kiss me there?

01:25:06.833 --> 01:25:09.375
- I liked to look at film
posters when I was a kid.

01:25:10.333 --> 01:25:12.124
- When you were a kid?

01:25:12.125 --> 01:25:14.792
- Yes, before I came here.

01:26:55.833 --> 01:26:57.333
- Oberkapo.
- Yes, sir.

01:26:59.167 --> 01:27:00.750
- They have looked long enough.

01:27:01.917 --> 01:27:04.249
I am sure, they now understand

01:27:04.250 --> 01:27:06.207
that no one steals from the Reich.

01:27:06.208 --> 01:27:08.041
- Yes, sir.

01:27:08.042 --> 01:27:13.042
Dismissed.

01:27:14.542 --> 01:27:15.999
- Berliner turned them in.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
I saw him watching them last night.

01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:21.000
- Thank you, Toivi.

01:27:32.333 --> 01:27:34.082
- Hello, I am Luka.

01:27:34.083 --> 01:27:36.042
- Sasha, hello.

01:27:43.625 --> 01:27:48.082
For such a brief acquaintance
that was a lovely smile.

01:27:49.001 --> 01:27:50.874
- Love at first sight.

01:27:50.875 --> 01:27:52.208
Those are my instructions.

01:27:55.208 --> 01:27:56.583
- It is a beautiful night.

01:27:57.708 --> 01:28:01.125
- Look at the moon, Sasha.
- Look at the board, Sasha.

01:28:05.417 --> 01:28:08.749
Do you want white?
- No, you have it.

01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:09.750
- I'll take it.

01:28:16.333 --> 01:28:18.417
- We should go just before dark.

01:28:19.292 --> 01:28:22.207
Enough light to find
our way into the woods.

01:28:22.208 --> 01:28:23.791
Too dark for them to hunt us.

01:28:23.792 --> 01:28:26.499
That will give us a head
start until the morning.

01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:27.500
- Right.

01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:32.832
- Is there an electrician?

01:28:32.833 --> 01:28:35.582
One you can trust?
- Yes, Abraham Weiss.

01:28:35.583 --> 01:28:37.374
He does some of the electrical work here.

01:28:37.375 --> 01:28:40.249
- Because among the last things we do,

01:28:40.250 --> 01:28:44.624
is we cut the electrical
lines and the telephone.

01:28:44.625 --> 01:28:47.333
It will leave them with
now way to call for help.

01:28:48.750 --> 01:28:49.917
- I understand.

01:28:52.542 --> 01:28:57.207
- How many sS are here?
- 16 and 125 Ukrainians.

01:28:57.208 --> 01:28:59.416
- The Ukrainians are all armed, right?

01:28:59.417 --> 01:29:01.417
- Yes, there is a lot of strength there.

01:29:03.125 --> 01:29:08.083
- But when you cut out the
brains, the strength is useless.

01:29:09.083 --> 01:29:11.333
- How do we get rid of 16 SS all at once?

01:29:16.667 --> 01:29:18.707
- I don't know if my men
are capable of killing.

01:29:18.708 --> 01:29:21.875
- But killing the SS
is the key to our plan.

01:29:32.875 --> 01:29:35.791
- I've a tailor, I have a
carpenter, I have two shoemakers.

01:29:35.792 --> 01:29:37.583
I ran a flour mill.

01:29:38.917 --> 01:29:41.416
- Before the war I was a book keeper.

01:29:41.417 --> 01:29:42.791
I played the piano.

01:29:42.792 --> 01:29:43.958
I wrote songs.

01:29:45.542 --> 01:29:47.458
They will manage because they have to.

01:29:49.583 --> 01:29:51.916
What is the simplest plan?

01:29:51.917 --> 01:29:53.499
I will tell you.

01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:56.958
600 prisoners walk out the main gate.

01:29:58.750 --> 01:30:00.624
They just walk out.

01:30:00.625 --> 01:30:02.833
Right after evening roll call.

01:30:05.167 --> 01:30:06.958
- They just walk out the front gate?

01:30:07.875 --> 01:30:09.749
That's impossible, that's crazy.

01:30:09.750 --> 01:30:11.791
- Except for one thing.

01:30:11.792 --> 01:30:14.707
Nothing is impossible for us.

01:30:14.708 --> 01:30:17.042
So let us create a plan,

01:30:18.792 --> 01:30:26.167
where 600 prisoners
walk out the main gate.

01:32:32.875 --> 01:32:34.832
- Are you waiting for the Russian?

01:32:34.833 --> 01:32:35.833
- Yes.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.624
- Are you in love with him?

01:32:38.625 --> 01:32:39.625
- I think so.

01:32:41.333 --> 01:32:42.167
What am I saying?

01:32:42.167 --> 01:32:43.167
I know so.

01:32:44.375 --> 01:32:45.375
- What's he like?

01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:48.541
- I don't know.

01:32:48.542 --> 01:32:51.042
I fell in love so quickly
I haven't found out yet.

01:32:53.417 --> 01:32:55.541
- Has he said that he loves you?

01:32:55.542 --> 01:32:58.499
- No, not until tonight, in about an hour.

01:33:01.792 --> 01:33:03.042
- Good evening.

01:33:10.833 --> 01:33:12.999
- Sasha, this is Abraham Weiss,

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.582
the electrician that I spoke to you about.

01:33:15.583 --> 01:33:17.707
We've just had a very interesting game.

01:33:17.708 --> 01:33:18.542
- Yes, we have.

01:33:18.543 --> 01:33:21.707
But I am a better electrician
than I am a chess player.

01:33:21.708 --> 01:33:23.083
Good to meet you, Lieutenant.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:25.666
- I'll be seeing you tomorrow night.

01:33:25.667 --> 01:33:26.667
- Good, good.

01:33:33.833 --> 01:33:34.833
- One thing I know.

01:33:36.417 --> 01:33:38.832
The Kapos have the run of the camp.

01:33:38.833 --> 01:33:40.249
For any plan to succeed

01:33:40.250 --> 01:33:42.791
we must have the cooperation
of at least one of them.

01:33:42.792 --> 01:33:44.500
- But they work for the Germans.

01:33:45.375 --> 01:33:47.292
Is there anyone we can trust?

01:33:48.417 --> 01:33:52.499
- Kapo Porchek, one or two others, maybe.

01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:55.457
One I know we can't trust
is a man named Berliner.

01:33:55.458 --> 01:33:59.667
- We must kill him, don't leave any marks.

01:34:00.958 --> 01:34:03.917
- It will be done, my people will do it.

01:34:10.833 --> 01:34:15.292
- We talked last night
about cutting out the brain.

01:34:16.750 --> 01:34:21.750
Let us suppose, just suppose
that most SS were dead.

01:34:22.125 --> 01:34:24.207
Even all of them.

01:34:24.208 --> 01:34:25.791
- Alright, let's suppose.

01:34:25.792 --> 01:34:28.167
- It would have to happen secretly.

01:34:29.125 --> 01:34:32.332
We would have to isolate them, kill them,

01:34:32.333 --> 01:34:36.958
one by one, in an hour at the most.

01:34:37.958 --> 01:34:39.833
Now let us assume we can do that.

01:34:42.417 --> 01:34:43.749
Where would we stand?

01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:45.832
- The Ukrainians would become confused.

01:34:45.833 --> 01:34:47.000
The escape could begin.

01:34:47.917 --> 01:34:48.917
- Right.

01:34:56.667 --> 01:34:58.916
The prisoners in compound three,

01:34:58.917 --> 01:35:01.750
the men who cremate the
bodies, how do we get them out?

01:35:03.292 --> 01:35:06.499
- This is a problem, they can't come out.

01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:07.832
We're forbidden to go in there.

01:35:07.833 --> 01:35:09.457
We can't even get a
message through to them.

01:35:09.458 --> 01:35:10.458
We've tried.

01:35:11.750 --> 01:35:13.292
I don't think we can help them.

01:35:24.833 --> 01:35:26.499
- You wanted to see me.

01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:27.500
- Yes.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.583
Can you make knives in your shop?

01:35:32.708 --> 01:35:33.708
- Like this?

01:35:35.833 --> 01:35:40.249
- Careful, yes, just like that.

01:35:40.250 --> 01:35:41.125
- How many?

01:35:41.126 --> 01:35:43.874
- As many as you can make, starting now.

01:35:43.875 --> 01:35:44.875
- Consider it done.

01:35:50.042 --> 01:35:54.708
- Leon, with your Kapo
Berliner the sooner the better.

01:35:56.625 --> 01:35:57.875
Luka, let's go.

01:36:08.583 --> 01:36:13.041
- This had better be
important, or it's 25 for you.

01:36:13.042 --> 01:36:16.999
- I told you sir, I don't know
what's happening in there.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:20.249
Kapo Porchek said for me
to get you right away.

01:36:20.250 --> 01:36:21.375
That's all I know.

01:36:26.125 --> 01:36:27.125
- Porchek!

01:36:29.042 --> 01:36:30.042
Porchek!

01:36:44.875 --> 01:36:47.166
- Only in the belly, no marks.

01:37:04.125 --> 01:37:04.958
Go and tell Sergeant Frenzel

01:37:04.959 --> 01:37:07.833
that Oberkapo Berliner is very sick.

01:37:54.667 --> 01:37:57.582
Everyone must be in position by 3:30.

01:37:57.583 --> 01:38:00.332
The killings must begin at four.

01:38:00.333 --> 01:38:02.000
It must be done in one hour.

01:38:03.542 --> 01:38:06.082
- Two things I've learned
about the Germans,

01:38:06.083 --> 01:38:07.957
their punctuality and their greed.

01:38:07.958 --> 01:38:10.250
Can we make use of that?
- I think so.

01:38:11.167 --> 01:38:12.832
For example, Samuel is making

01:38:12.833 --> 01:38:14.874
a pair of boots for Lieutenant Niemann.

01:38:14.875 --> 01:38:16.041
We can get him to the shoe shop

01:38:16.042 --> 01:38:18.374
for a fitting and kill him there.

01:38:18.375 --> 01:38:19.999
- What about Reichleitner and Wagner?

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.874
- Reichleitner is a problem.

01:38:21.875 --> 01:38:24.416
We know he checks the entire camp at noon

01:38:24.417 --> 01:38:26.541
and then again at five after roll call.

01:38:26.542 --> 01:38:28.457
But he always has men with him.

01:38:28.458 --> 01:38:30.124
Wagner has no pattern.

01:38:30.125 --> 01:38:32.249
- Shlomo is making jewellery for him.

01:38:32.250 --> 01:38:34.083
Could you get him to the machine shop?

01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:38.833
- We need this kind of
information on every SS in camp.

01:38:40.167 --> 01:38:41.416
We must have our killers

01:38:41.417 --> 01:38:43.916
in the right place at the right time.

01:38:43.917 --> 01:38:47.832
Can we get some watches, so
we can coordinate our timing?

01:38:47.833 --> 01:38:49.875
- Yes, I think so, from the sorting shed.

01:38:50.875 --> 01:38:51.708
- Good.

01:38:51.709 --> 01:38:54.083
- Sasha, I have to be one of the killers.

01:38:55.042 --> 01:38:56.042
I want Wagner.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:03.250
- Shlomo, my men will be
in charge of the killings.

01:39:04.125 --> 01:39:06.417
And I will make the assignments.

01:39:18.875 --> 01:39:22.917
- Sasha, I know I'm not
supposed to talk about it,

01:39:24.625 --> 01:39:28.082
but it's terrifying to
listen to you talking

01:39:28.083 --> 01:39:30.375
about life and death is such cold blood.

01:39:32.083 --> 01:39:35.958
- Well, sometimes one has
to think of them that way.

01:39:37.875 --> 01:39:38.875
- No.

01:39:40.458 --> 01:39:44.457
- No, why not?

01:39:44.458 --> 01:39:47.417
- Because, everything is too real to me.

01:39:49.167 --> 01:39:50.167
Too alive.

01:39:53.792 --> 01:39:56.292
Sasha, what I feel for you...

01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:58.833
I--

01:39:58.834 --> 01:40:03.458
- No, Luka, you must not say that.

01:40:07.458 --> 01:40:09.458
Please, listen to me.

01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:14.625
I have a wife and a little daughter.

01:40:17.250 --> 01:40:19.583
As far as I know they're still living.

01:40:22.917 --> 01:40:24.542
I love them both very much.

01:40:27.750 --> 01:40:29.042
- Why didn't you tell me?

01:40:31.333 --> 01:40:32.583
- I do not know.

01:40:35.667 --> 01:40:38.167
We are pretending, aren't we?

01:40:41.833 --> 01:40:42.917
- Pretending?

01:40:44.333 --> 01:40:45.333
- Oh.

01:40:47.875 --> 01:40:52.875
Lukatshka, I never intended...

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:32.291
- Oberscharfuhrer Niemann.

01:41:32.292 --> 01:41:33.666
Oberscharfuhrer Frenzel.

01:41:33.667 --> 01:41:36.499
Wagner and I will be in
Lublin for three days.

01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:40.124
No transports are coming
in until after we're back.

01:41:40.125 --> 01:41:43.416
You two will be in
charge while we're away.

01:41:43.417 --> 01:41:45.625
Alright, we'd better go, gentlemen?

01:41:55.542 --> 01:41:58.916
- We just found out that
Captain Reichleitner

01:41:58.917 --> 01:42:02.458
and Wagner left today
for a three day trip.

01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:05.958
Leon and I have come to a decision.

01:42:07.583 --> 01:42:08.707
- We escape tomorrow.

01:42:08.708 --> 01:42:11.125
- Yes, at last.
- Oh, god.

01:42:12.625 --> 01:42:14.792
- Now let us go over the details.

01:42:16.292 --> 01:42:21.124
The killings will start
at four o'clock tomorrow.

01:42:21.125 --> 01:42:23.375
Until then, it's a normal day.

01:42:24.583 --> 01:42:28.624
Leon will be in charge of compound two,

01:42:28.625 --> 01:42:30.792
I will be in compound one.

01:42:31.667 --> 01:42:33.207
Porchek, you will arrange for me

01:42:33.208 --> 01:42:36.416
and two of my men to be
in the carpenter shop.

01:42:36.417 --> 01:42:39.666
And Toivi will run his little legs off,

01:42:39.667 --> 01:42:41.417
carrying messages between us.

01:42:42.375 --> 01:42:46.374
Who is scheduled to take
evening roll call with Frenzel?

01:42:46.375 --> 01:42:48.791
- Sergeant Wolf.
- He must be killed as well.

01:42:48.792 --> 01:42:51.541
- Leon and I will handle that.

01:42:51.542 --> 01:42:52.542
I promise you.

01:42:53.958 --> 01:42:57.207
- When we hear Judah's
bugle, we act normal.

01:42:57.208 --> 01:42:59.666
We go to the assembly area.

01:42:59.667 --> 01:43:02.624
By then the key SS should be dead.

01:43:02.625 --> 01:43:04.457
And instead of dismissing us,

01:43:04.458 --> 01:43:08.457
Porchek will march us to the main gate.

01:43:08.458 --> 01:43:10.707
We will have pistols to take care

01:43:10.708 --> 01:43:12.332
of the guards in the tower.

01:43:12.333 --> 01:43:15.624
We kill the two Ukrainians at the gate,

01:43:15.625 --> 01:43:18.166
open it and out we go.

01:43:18.167 --> 01:43:20.792
Running like Cossacks into the woods.

01:43:22.458 --> 01:43:24.458
If anything goes wrong before we get out

01:43:25.708 --> 01:43:27.624
it is everyone for himself.

01:43:27.625 --> 01:43:30.749
- I've been working on the
stoves in the Ukrainian barrack.

01:43:30.750 --> 01:43:31.999
I think I can steal some rifles

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:33.750
and ammunition from there tomorrow.

01:43:34.917 --> 01:43:36.833
- What do you think?
- Good.

01:43:38.208 --> 01:43:41.458
Meet my men just before
roll call in the kitchen.

01:43:42.625 --> 01:43:47.042
Shlomo, do not take any unnecessary risks.

01:43:47.958 --> 01:43:48.958
- In Sobibor?

01:44:06.208 --> 01:44:09.332
- Did you know that tomorrow
is the beginning of Succoth?

01:44:09.333 --> 01:44:12.582
- Yes, it is a holy day.

01:44:12.583 --> 01:44:15.750
- I forgot, and my father was a rabbi.

01:44:17.208 --> 01:44:19.249
- They kill on holy days.

01:44:19.250 --> 01:44:20.875
Why not the other way around?

01:44:21.875 --> 01:44:22.958
God will forgive.

01:44:23.792 --> 01:44:26.625
- There are those here who
wonder if we can forgive God.

01:44:29.708 --> 01:44:32.833
This plan of ours, do you
think it can really work?

01:44:34.958 --> 01:44:39.333
- Yes, but it would not hurt to pray.

01:45:06.167 --> 01:45:07.042
- What's wrong with you?

01:45:07.043 --> 01:45:08.582
Today's supposed to
look like a normal day,

01:45:08.583 --> 01:45:10.416
you're dressed like
you're going to a wedding.

01:45:10.417 --> 01:45:11.250
- I'm sorry.

01:45:11.251 --> 01:45:13.749
It's going to be cold in the forest.

01:45:13.750 --> 01:45:15.082
I'll go and change.
- No, it's too late.

01:45:15.083 --> 01:45:17.292
You'll just draw more
attention to yourself.

01:45:26.292 --> 01:45:27.541
- Who can work?

01:45:27.542 --> 01:45:29.957
- You can, it makes the time pass by.

01:45:55.625 --> 01:45:58.750
- Oh my god, it's the SS, look at this.

01:45:59.875 --> 01:46:02.749
They're new, aren't they?
- Yes.

01:46:17.125 --> 01:46:18.249
- SS men just arrived.

01:46:18.250 --> 01:46:19.457
I've never seen them before.

01:46:19.458 --> 01:46:21.957
- How many?
- 25, 30, I don't know.

01:46:21.958 --> 01:46:23.375
- Where?
- In the canteen.

01:46:24.958 --> 01:46:26.833
- Damn, what are they doing here today?

01:46:29.125 --> 01:46:31.999
We've got to get word to Sasha right away.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:33.541
God almighty, if word gets out we're dead.

01:46:33.542 --> 01:46:34.625
We're all dead.

01:46:58.333 --> 01:47:00.458
They've been there over two hours already.

01:47:03.042 --> 01:47:04.375
- What are they doing here?

01:47:06.833 --> 01:47:08.333
- Maybe they're just visiting?

01:47:09.375 --> 01:47:11.708
- Visiting, a death camp?

01:47:12.708 --> 01:47:14.499
- Supposedly there's a
very good canteen there.

01:47:14.500 --> 01:47:16.041
A lot of vodka.

01:47:16.042 --> 01:47:19.999
But in any case, with all those
SS we don't have a chance.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:21.291
- But the longer we wait,

01:47:21.292 --> 01:47:23.249
the more chance of something leaking out.

01:47:23.250 --> 01:47:24.499
We have two choices.

01:47:24.500 --> 01:47:26.208
Neither of them is good.

01:47:28.708 --> 01:47:29.708
We postpone.

01:47:32.375 --> 01:47:34.917
- Agreed, I'll pass the word.

01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:39.833
Postponed.

01:47:50.917 --> 01:47:51.999
Thank god we waited.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:53.583
That would have been a disaster.

01:47:54.667 --> 01:47:56.292
- Yes, it would have.

01:47:57.458 --> 01:47:59.291
But we have to go tomorrow no matter what

01:47:59.292 --> 01:48:01.457
before Reichleitner and Wagner get back.

01:48:01.458 --> 01:48:03.458
Too many people know now.

01:48:04.625 --> 01:48:05.625
- Tomorrow.

01:48:22.500 --> 01:48:23.874
- Stop.

01:48:23.875 --> 01:48:25.875
You, work here, come on.

01:48:47.417 --> 01:48:49.292
- Sasha will be here in a few minutes.

01:49:23.917 --> 01:49:25.624
- Have you seen Sergeant Frenzel?

01:49:25.625 --> 01:49:26.625
- No.

01:49:27.708 --> 01:49:28.542
- Where is Frenzel?

01:49:28.543 --> 01:49:30.624
- Outside the sergeant's barrack.

01:49:30.625 --> 01:49:32.166
- Do you know where he is to be killed?

01:49:32.167 --> 01:49:33.666
- Yes, the carpenter shop.

01:49:33.667 --> 01:49:35.875
- Do not get him in
there before I tell you.

01:49:42.625 --> 01:49:43.625
- You're ready?
- Yes.

01:49:43.626 --> 01:49:44.791
Take us to the clothing store.

01:49:44.792 --> 01:49:45.874
Also pick up Mundek on the way.

01:49:45.875 --> 01:49:46.875
- Right.

01:49:57.250 --> 01:49:58.250
- Sir.

01:49:59.833 --> 01:50:01.833
Please, sir, they're late.

01:50:39.625 --> 01:50:41.291
- So far so good.

01:50:41.292 --> 01:50:42.625
Go tell Sasha we are ready.

01:50:46.375 --> 01:50:47.375
- Oberkapo.

01:50:48.542 --> 01:50:49.375
- Yes, sir.

01:50:49.376 --> 01:50:50.582
- Fix three men from the sorting shed.

01:50:50.583 --> 01:50:51.417
- Yes, sir.

01:50:51.418 --> 01:50:52.499
For what job, sir?

01:50:52.500 --> 01:50:54.333
- For heavy labour in the north camp.

01:50:55.208 --> 01:50:56.583
Do it.
- Yes, sir.

01:51:04.042 --> 01:51:06.333
You, you, you, come with me now.

01:51:11.917 --> 01:51:15.083
- Toivi.
- Leon, look, it's Porchek.

01:51:17.833 --> 01:51:19.167
He's going the wrong way.

01:51:23.042 --> 01:51:25.416
- Toivi, tell Sasha an SS
corporal with a machine gun

01:51:25.417 --> 01:51:27.124
is taking away Porchek
with three prisoners.

01:51:27.125 --> 01:51:28.207
I don't know where they're going.

01:51:28.208 --> 01:51:29.042
I don't know what it means,

01:51:29.043 --> 01:51:30.916
but we may have to do without Porchek now.

01:51:30.917 --> 01:51:31.750
Hurry.

01:51:31.750 --> 01:51:32.583
You have 10 minutes before

01:51:32.584 --> 01:51:33.944
you bring sergeant Wolf back here.

01:51:45.292 --> 01:51:47.749
- Sergeant Wolf, I've
been looking for you.

01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:50.874
Tailor Mundek has found a
beautiful leather coat for you.

01:51:50.875 --> 01:51:53.332
If you can stop in the
clothing storeroom, sir?

01:51:53.333 --> 01:51:55.332
He says, it'll just take a minute.

01:51:55.333 --> 01:51:57.833
- Alright, in a minute.

01:52:01.500 --> 01:52:03.417
- Look out, Klat's coming in.

01:52:04.417 --> 01:52:06.749
What are we going to do?

01:52:06.750 --> 01:52:07.583
- Get back.

01:52:07.583 --> 01:52:08.583
Get back.

01:52:15.792 --> 01:52:18.124
Yes, sir, can I help you, sir?

01:52:18.125 --> 01:52:19.707
- I want a wool shirt.

01:52:19.708 --> 01:52:21.875
- They're in the back,
please help yourself.

01:52:32.333 --> 01:52:34.542
- You, you don't work here.

01:52:35.417 --> 01:52:38.417
You work in the sorting
shed, what are you doing?

01:52:47.375 --> 01:52:48.375
- It begins.

01:52:51.833 --> 01:52:53.208
There's no turning back now.

01:52:56.500 --> 01:52:57.500
Hide the body.

01:53:24.583 --> 01:53:25.417
- Good afternoon, sir.

01:53:25.418 --> 01:53:27.791
- The putzer told me
you had a leather coat for me.

01:53:27.792 --> 01:53:30.999
- Yes, sir, I think you're
going to like it very much, sir.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.416
I might have to let it out at the waist.

01:53:33.417 --> 01:53:34.957
It's a beautiful leather, sir.

01:53:34.958 --> 01:53:36.416
Very expensive.

01:53:36.417 --> 01:53:37.417
- Mm.

01:53:38.208 --> 01:53:40.749
Handsome, very handsome.

01:53:40.750 --> 01:53:41.583
Good.

01:53:41.584 --> 01:53:42.916
You can fit me at the tailor tomorrow.

01:53:42.917 --> 01:53:45.333
- But, sir, wouldn't you
like to see how it looks now?

01:53:50.708 --> 01:53:52.541
What was that?

01:54:14.917 --> 01:54:18.457
- Sergeant Beckmann, I've
been looking for you.

01:54:18.458 --> 01:54:21.332
The tailor Mundek has found
a beautiful jacket for you.

01:54:21.333 --> 01:54:23.999
If you could stop in the
clothing storeroom, sir?

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.249
He said it would just take a second.

01:54:26.250 --> 01:54:27.083
- A jacket?

01:54:27.084 --> 01:54:28.916
Who said I wanted a jacket?

01:54:28.917 --> 01:54:30.207
- I don't know, sir, but the tailor said

01:54:30.208 --> 01:54:31.958
it would be perfect for you.

01:54:34.750 --> 01:54:36.708
- Alright, I'll look at it.

01:54:55.625 --> 01:54:57.541
- Yeah?
- There are two dead so far.

01:54:57.542 --> 01:54:59.875
Sergeant Wolf and Corporal Klat.

01:55:01.958 --> 01:55:05.167
I thought we had Sergeant
Beckmann, but he walked away.

01:55:09.208 --> 01:55:10.042
- Where's Beckmann?

01:55:10.042 --> 01:55:11.042
Have you seen sergeant Beckmann?

01:55:11.043 --> 01:55:13.624
- Yes, he was here, but he left.

01:55:13.625 --> 01:55:15.083
- Damn it, we lost him.

01:55:16.125 --> 01:55:17.832
He must have gone back to his office.

01:55:17.833 --> 01:55:18.833
- Leon.

01:55:21.750 --> 01:55:24.000
If you need me, I want to help.

01:55:25.667 --> 01:55:27.125
- Can you deal with Beckmann?

01:55:29.625 --> 01:55:31.125
- Yes, I can.

01:55:32.750 --> 01:55:35.083
- I'll find a way to get you there.

01:55:44.625 --> 01:55:46.999
- Sergeant Frenzel, they'd like to see you

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:48.749
in the carpenter shop at 4:30.

01:55:48.750 --> 01:55:49.667
- Why?

01:55:49.668 --> 01:55:52.082
- To pick the colour of the
stain for you book case.

01:55:52.083 --> 01:55:53.083
- To pick the colour?

01:55:54.542 --> 01:55:57.624
Why didn't that idiot ask me
when I was in there yesterday?

01:55:57.625 --> 01:55:58.999
- I don't know, sir.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:00.582
Should I tell them 4:30?

01:56:00.583 --> 01:56:03.999
- No, I'll be there when
I decide to be there.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:05.958
Today, tomorrow or whenever.

01:56:17.708 --> 01:56:18.708
- Lukatshka.

01:56:27.250 --> 01:56:28.250
- Sasha.

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:41.041
- Will you stand next
with me at the roll call?

01:56:41.042 --> 01:56:43.582
- If you will do one thing for me?

01:56:43.583 --> 01:56:45.374
- I will try.

01:56:45.375 --> 01:56:46.375
Tell me.

01:56:50.500 --> 01:56:53.708
- If you will wear this for good luck.

01:57:14.542 --> 01:57:17.208
- Luka, it is beautiful.

01:57:25.875 --> 01:57:27.083
- I made it for you.

01:57:43.583 --> 01:57:44.874
- You.
- Yes, sir.

01:57:44.875 --> 01:57:46.082
- Take my horse to the stables.

01:57:46.083 --> 01:57:47.083
- Yes, sir.

01:58:00.792 --> 01:58:02.374
- Good afternoon, sir.

01:58:02.375 --> 01:58:04.083
- Are my boots ready?
- Yes, sir.

01:58:05.125 --> 01:58:06.499
I hope you'll be pleased with them, sir.

01:58:06.500 --> 01:58:07.874
- I want to try them on.

01:58:07.875 --> 01:58:10.374
- Yes, sir, by all means, sir.

01:58:10.375 --> 01:58:15.375
Please.

01:58:54.792 --> 01:58:55.917
- See if anyone heard.

01:58:57.917 --> 01:58:59.207
- It's all clear.

01:58:59.208 --> 01:59:01.124
- Sasha, take his pistol.

01:59:01.125 --> 01:59:03.124
- You keep it, clear up.

01:59:03.125 --> 01:59:04.167
Fallaster is next.

01:59:20.167 --> 01:59:22.832
- Meet me in the kitchen
just before roll call.

01:59:22.833 --> 01:59:25.916
I'm going to steal some rifles
from the Ukrainian barrack.

01:59:25.917 --> 01:59:28.875
Now, Moses, if I'm killed--
- No, Shlomo.

01:59:42.167 --> 01:59:44.042
- Don't worry, we'll be alright.

01:59:54.667 --> 01:59:55.667
- Good luck, Shlomo.

02:00:07.375 --> 02:00:09.542
- It's Sergeant Fallaster.

02:00:11.083 --> 02:00:12.583
You'd better hide.

02:00:15.250 --> 02:00:17.250
- Scharfuhrer Fallaster.

02:00:18.750 --> 02:00:19.583
- What is it?

02:00:19.584 --> 02:00:21.458
- A message from Scharfuhrer Beckmann

02:00:32.583 --> 02:00:34.832
- Tell him I took care of this yesterday

02:00:34.833 --> 02:00:36.457
and not to bother me about it again.

02:00:36.458 --> 02:00:37.957
- Yes, Scharfuhrer.

02:00:40.458 --> 02:00:42.499
- Are my boots finished?

02:00:42.500 --> 02:00:43.624
- Yes, sir.

02:00:43.625 --> 02:00:45.750
They're finished, please sit down.

02:00:47.667 --> 02:00:48.957
I've stretched them, sir.

02:00:48.958 --> 02:00:50.457
So I think you'll find them
a lot more comfortable now.

02:00:50.458 --> 02:00:54.542
- It's for my wife, my child.

02:02:59.125 --> 02:03:01.166
- We need help, go and ask Klat.

02:03:01.167 --> 02:03:02.167
- Yes, sir.

02:03:17.708 --> 02:03:19.125
- Sturmmann Klat?

02:03:37.667 --> 02:03:38.500
- Where's Klat?

02:03:38.501 --> 02:03:39.666
- I don't know.

02:03:39.667 --> 02:03:40.916
He's not there, Scharfuhrer Bauer.

02:03:40.917 --> 02:03:42.291
- Well, I haven't got all day.

02:03:42.292 --> 02:03:44.166
Get two men to unload this.

02:03:44.167 --> 02:03:45.583
- Yes, sir.

02:04:17.958 --> 02:04:19.375
- Here's Porchek.

02:04:23.251 --> 02:04:24.707
Where have you been?

02:04:24.708 --> 02:04:27.749
- They took me to the north
camp, I couldn't get out of it.

02:04:27.750 --> 02:04:32.082
- So far, we've been very
lucky, but Frenzel is missing

02:04:32.083 --> 02:04:34.249
and we may have trouble with Beckmann.

02:04:34.250 --> 02:04:36.082
Go over to compound two.

02:04:36.083 --> 02:04:37.125
Leon needs help.

02:04:42.958 --> 02:04:44.582
- I just can't believe it.

02:04:44.583 --> 02:04:45.874
We're actually killing SS men.

02:04:45.875 --> 02:04:50.292
I mean that's a hard thing
to believe, killing them.

02:04:51.333 --> 02:04:54.667
It's beautiful, I just can't believe it.

02:05:10.708 --> 02:05:13.875
- Mm, magnificent.

02:05:15.042 --> 02:05:19.292
The aroma alone, words fail me.

02:05:20.500 --> 02:05:21.792
Tell me how you do it.

02:05:24.125 --> 02:05:25.792
You are a plumber, are you not?

02:05:26.875 --> 02:05:28.042
Of course you are.

02:05:29.333 --> 02:05:33.207
Only a Jewish plumber could concoct

02:05:33.208 --> 02:05:36.583
something so obviously delicious.

02:05:37.500 --> 02:05:38.917
So tell me how you do it.

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.749
You do speak, don't you?

02:05:51.750 --> 02:05:52.750
- Yes, sir.

02:06:04.042 --> 02:06:06.458
- What's your Christian name?

02:06:09.042 --> 02:06:10.708
I'm just trying to be friendly.

02:06:13.625 --> 02:06:15.416
What's your Christian name?

02:06:15.417 --> 02:06:17.666
- I have no Christian
name, only a Jewish name.

02:06:20.583 --> 02:06:25.542
My name is Hershel Zuckerman
and don't you forget it.

02:06:52.250 --> 02:06:54.624
- We can't wait any longer,
it's almost time for roll call

02:06:54.625 --> 02:06:55.749
Go to Beckmann's office.

02:06:55.750 --> 02:06:57.582
If everything looks alright, kill him.

02:06:57.583 --> 02:06:59.249
You come right back here, get Kalimali

02:06:59.250 --> 02:07:02.332
and the other Russians,
take them to compound one.

02:07:02.333 --> 02:07:04.791
Chaim, this one we didn't plan.

02:07:04.792 --> 02:07:06.583
- I know, thank you.

02:07:07.625 --> 02:07:09.125
- Here, use this.

02:07:12.792 --> 02:07:15.875
- No, please let him use this one.

02:07:19.542 --> 02:07:20.542
- Good luck.

02:07:21.875 --> 02:07:23.125
- I'll be back.

02:07:42.625 --> 02:07:45.292
- Two more, huh?
- Come on, move.

02:07:46.750 --> 02:07:47.750
Let's move.

02:07:53.792 --> 02:07:55.083
Sergeant Beckmann.

02:08:08.208 --> 02:08:09.416
- What are you doing here?

02:08:09.417 --> 02:08:10.417
What, what?

02:08:18.333 --> 02:08:20.417
- Kill him, do it, do it.

02:08:40.917 --> 02:08:43.417
We'll put him behind the desk.

02:08:58.792 --> 02:09:00.542
- Go back, that's it.

02:09:10.708 --> 02:09:12.874
- It went well, we killed five.

02:09:12.875 --> 02:09:13.999
- That makes 10 all together.

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.999
- 11.
- 20 would have been better.

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:20.291
Here are some pistols, Leon has the rest.

02:09:20.292 --> 02:09:21.375
- Good man, Kalimali.

02:09:23.500 --> 02:09:25.416
- What's in the box?
- Two rifles.

02:09:25.417 --> 02:09:28.083
- Ammunition?
- Just one clip, each.

02:09:30.250 --> 02:09:33.207
- Go to the kitchen, you take him.

02:09:33.208 --> 02:09:35.457
Ask Shlomo if he has any ammunition.

02:09:35.458 --> 02:09:36.458
- Right.

02:09:41.167 --> 02:09:42.833
- So far, we've been too lucky.

02:09:43.750 --> 02:09:46.374
Someone is bound to catch on soon.

02:09:46.375 --> 02:09:49.624
- Judah, you'd better
sound the bugle, now.

02:09:49.625 --> 02:09:51.333
- Still no Sergeant Frenzel?

02:09:52.250 --> 02:09:55.832
- If he shows up at roll
call we can get him there.

02:09:55.833 --> 02:09:58.625
If not god help us.

02:10:27.792 --> 02:10:28.792
- Follow me!

02:10:36.500 --> 02:10:40.041
Columns of fours, we do it every day.

02:10:40.042 --> 02:10:41.042
Line up.

02:10:51.708 --> 02:10:52.708
Follow me.

02:11:13.667 --> 02:11:15.582
- Are you wearing it?

02:11:15.583 --> 02:11:17.000
- Did you think I would not?

02:11:23.667 --> 02:11:25.542
It's going to be cold at night.

02:11:33.208 --> 02:11:34.167
- Where is Shlomo, have you seen him?

02:11:34.168 --> 02:11:36.083
- He'll be here, he'll be here.

02:11:39.292 --> 02:11:41.667
- Put the bullets here, you see.

02:11:43.125 --> 02:11:46.250
- Here, I don't know how to use this.

02:11:53.125 --> 02:11:54.083
- Is everything going alright?

02:11:54.084 --> 02:11:55.749
- Yes, everything's fine.

02:11:55.750 --> 02:11:57.874
- How long do we stay here?

02:11:57.875 --> 02:12:00.582
- Until I blow the whistle for roll call.

02:12:16.625 --> 02:12:19.749
- More than 10 minutes before roll call.

02:12:19.750 --> 02:12:21.832
- I don't think we can wait that long.

02:12:21.833 --> 02:12:22.958
Look what's happening.

02:12:30.958 --> 02:12:32.582
- We must go.

02:12:32.583 --> 02:12:33.583
- Now?

02:12:34.417 --> 02:12:35.417
Now.

02:12:39.250 --> 02:12:42.124
- Come on, line up in fours!

02:12:44.208 --> 02:12:45.874
Line up in fours!

02:12:45.875 --> 02:12:48.291
Line up!

02:12:48.292 --> 02:12:49.625
Come on, let's go.

02:12:50.500 --> 02:12:52.249
Everybody in line.

02:12:52.250 --> 02:12:53.250
Come on.

02:13:21.083 --> 02:13:22.083
- Beckmann?

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:35.167
Beckmann, hey!

02:13:43.083 --> 02:13:44.083
Hello?

02:13:45.958 --> 02:13:46.958
Hello?

02:13:51.417 --> 02:13:53.124
- Everybody in line!

02:13:53.125 --> 02:13:53.958
- Scharfuhrer Bauer.

02:13:53.959 --> 02:13:56.249
Niemann is dead in the shoe shop.

02:13:56.250 --> 02:13:58.499
And Fallaster, both murdered.

02:13:58.500 --> 02:13:59.749
- No.

02:13:59.750 --> 02:14:01.875
Stop, stop!

02:14:11.667 --> 02:14:13.542
- We'll never make it
to the front gate now.

02:14:16.750 --> 02:14:20.624
- Listen to me, our day has come.

02:14:20.625 --> 02:14:23.207
Most of the SS are dead!

02:14:23.208 --> 02:14:25.666
It's everyone for himself now.

02:14:25.667 --> 02:14:29.624
- Those of you who survive, bear witness.

02:14:29.625 --> 02:14:32.957
Let the world know what has happened here!

02:14:32.958 --> 02:14:34.624
God is with you!

02:14:34.625 --> 02:14:37.374
Now let nothing stop you!

02:15:12.750 --> 02:15:15.832
Move, move!

02:15:15.833 --> 02:15:18.874
Come on!

02:15:18.875 --> 02:15:20.332
Come on!

02:15:20.333 --> 02:15:21.167
- Leon.

02:15:21.168 --> 02:15:22.832
- Go on, save yourselves.

02:15:22.833 --> 02:15:25.416
Save yourselves, you're free.

02:15:25.417 --> 02:15:28.874
The gate is down, move, move, move!

02:15:28.875 --> 02:15:30.082
Move, move!

02:15:30.083 --> 02:15:31.541
- Come on, Leon.

02:15:31.542 --> 02:15:33.624
Let's go.
- Get up, get up!

02:15:33.625 --> 02:15:35.249
Move.
- Leon.

02:15:35.250 --> 02:15:36.499
- Move.

02:15:36.500 --> 02:15:38.249
- Leon, come on, we must go.

02:15:38.250 --> 02:15:39.666
- Leon.
- Come on.

02:15:50.083 --> 02:15:51.083
- Cover me.

02:16:11.458 --> 02:16:13.082
Take it, go.

02:17:28.333 --> 02:17:29.333
Now.

02:17:51.333 --> 02:17:52.333
- Shlomo!

02:17:53.333 --> 02:17:54.665
- Are you hurt?
- No, Shlomo.

02:17:54.666 --> 02:17:55.500
- Then get out.

02:17:55.501 --> 02:18:00.500
Take Moses with you, and
I'll find you in the forest.

02:18:01.333 --> 02:18:02.333
Go.

02:22:01.917 --> 02:22:04.667
- No, no, Samuel, get up, get up.

02:22:06.542 --> 02:22:07.542
Get up.

02:22:09.458 --> 02:22:12.707
Get up, Samuel, we're almost at the woods.

02:22:12.708 --> 02:22:13.708
Get up.

02:22:58.083 --> 02:22:59.499
- Over 300 prisoners

02:22:59.500 --> 02:23:01.208
escaped safely to the forest.

02:23:03.417 --> 02:23:06.666
Here, Eda and Itzhak
Lichtman found each other.

02:23:06.667 --> 02:23:09.041
On the run, they managed to stay alive.

02:23:09.042 --> 02:23:11.541
After the war they were married
and emigrated to Israel,

02:23:11.542 --> 02:23:14.166
where they till live in
Holon, near Tel Aviv,

02:23:14.167 --> 02:23:16.125
close to other Sobibor survivors.

02:23:19.042 --> 02:23:21.624
Toivi with two other boys
was hidden by a Polish farmer

02:23:21.625 --> 02:23:24.124
who eventually shot them for the money.

02:23:24.125 --> 02:23:26.999
With a bullet in his jaw,
Toivi pretended to be dead

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.167
and managed to stay alive until liberated.

02:23:30.667 --> 02:23:34.416
Thomas Toivi Blatt married
and has three children.

02:23:34.417 --> 02:23:36.707
Today he lives in Santa
Barbara, California.

02:23:36.708 --> 02:23:38.791
Yet he returns each year to Sobibor

02:23:38.792 --> 02:23:41.292
in remembrance of his
family who died there.

02:23:43.708 --> 02:23:46.124
Chaim and Selma made it to a small farm

02:23:46.125 --> 02:23:49.041
where they were given
shelter until the liberation.

02:23:49.042 --> 02:23:50.749
Happily married for more than 40 years,

02:23:50.750 --> 02:23:52.999
and the parents of two grown children,

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.500
Chaim and Selma Engel
now live in Connecticut.

02:23:57.917 --> 02:24:00.457
Stanislaw Shlomo Szmajzner
joined the partisans

02:24:00.458 --> 02:24:03.666
and became an active fighter
against the Nazis in Poland.

02:24:03.667 --> 02:24:05.082
There is no record of what happened

02:24:05.083 --> 02:24:07.249
to his younger brother Moses.

02:24:07.250 --> 02:24:09.457
After the war, Shlomo emigrated to Brazil,

02:24:09.458 --> 02:24:11.832
where he married and raised two sons.

02:24:11.833 --> 02:24:14.082
In South America he
was largely responsible

02:24:14.083 --> 02:24:18.291
for the discovery of Sergeant
Gustav Wagner in 1978.

02:24:18.292 --> 02:24:19.707
Brazilian law did not allow

02:24:19.708 --> 02:24:21.624
for sergeant Wagner's extradition,

02:24:21.625 --> 02:24:24.332
but a year later he was
found stabbed to death.

02:24:24.333 --> 02:24:26.917
The records list Wagner's death, suicide.

02:24:30.208 --> 02:24:32.707
Captain Franz Reichleitner
was reassigned to Trieste,

02:24:32.708 --> 02:24:35.457
and was killed by
partisans less three months

02:24:35.458 --> 02:24:36.875
after the Sobibor revolt.

02:24:38.167 --> 02:24:40.374
Esther Terner managed
to hide from the Germans

02:24:40.375 --> 02:24:41.999
and from hostile Polish nationals

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.041
until the Russian liberation.

02:24:44.042 --> 02:24:45.457
She moved to the United States

02:24:45.458 --> 02:24:48.333
and now lives with her
husband, Irving, in New Jersey.

02:24:49.250 --> 02:24:50.707
Esther has testified in many

02:24:50.708 --> 02:24:52.832
war crimes trials in West Germany.

02:24:52.833 --> 02:24:54.249
Including the trial of Sergeant

02:24:54.250 --> 02:24:56.874
Eric Bauer who died in prison.

02:24:56.875 --> 02:24:58.582
Esther and Thomas Blatt testified

02:24:58.583 --> 02:25:00.332
at the trial of sergeant Frenzel

02:25:00.333 --> 02:25:02.249
who was convicted and is still alive,

02:25:02.250 --> 02:25:03.792
serving a life sentence.

02:25:06.750 --> 02:25:08.582
Sasha Pechersky and many of his men

02:25:08.583 --> 02:25:10.291
made it back to Russian lines to rejoin

02:25:10.292 --> 02:25:12.374
the fight against the Nazis.

02:25:12.375 --> 02:25:15.499
In 1963 Sasha gave key testimony

02:25:15.500 --> 02:25:17.332
in a war crimes trial against

02:25:17.333 --> 02:25:19.707
11 Ukrainian guards at Sobibor.

02:25:19.708 --> 02:25:21.416
10 of them were sentenced to death.

02:25:21.417 --> 02:25:24.666
Today at 77, Sasha is retired
and lives with his wife

02:25:24.667 --> 02:25:27.625
Olga in Rostov-on-the-Don
in the Soviet Union.

02:25:30.500 --> 02:25:32.749
Luka vanished in the Polish countryside.

02:25:32.750 --> 02:25:34.249
All efforts, including Sasha's,

02:25:34.250 --> 02:25:36.457
to locate her proved unsuccessful.

02:25:36.458 --> 02:25:39.124
The good luck shirt Luka gave
to Sasha is now displayed

02:25:39.125 --> 02:25:41.416
in a Russian museum
honouring those who fought

02:25:41.417 --> 02:25:43.958
and died for freedom during World War II.

02:25:47.333 --> 02:25:50.499
Leon Feldhendler fought his
way back to Lublin in Poland

02:25:50.500 --> 02:25:53.332
where he remained safe
until the liberation.

02:25:53.333 --> 02:25:54.749
There he ran a small business

02:25:54.750 --> 02:25:56.707
employing and helping many Jews

02:25:56.708 --> 02:25:59.874
who had survived the
camps, including Sobibor.

02:25:59.875 --> 02:26:01.374
14 months after the escape,

02:26:01.375 --> 02:26:04.249
in a confrontation with
a group of antisemites,

02:26:04.250 --> 02:26:07.792
Leon was murdered by his
countrymen because he was a Jew.

02:26:09.917 --> 02:26:13.416
October the 14th, 1943, Sobibor.

02:26:13.417 --> 02:26:14.832
A Nazi death camp where over

02:26:14.833 --> 02:26:17.874
one quarter of a million Jews were killed.

02:26:17.875 --> 02:26:19.207
But in the revolt that day,

02:26:19.208 --> 02:26:22.957
over 300 of the 600
prisoners made it to freedom.

02:26:22.958 --> 02:26:24.541
Something which had never happened before,

02:26:24.542 --> 02:26:27.291
and would never happen
again in World War II.

02:26:27.292 --> 02:26:30.416
Within days, SS chief Himmler
ordered the camp closed,

02:26:30.417 --> 02:26:32.667
dismantled and planted with pine trees.

02:26:34.417 --> 02:26:38.541
In that forest now stands
this monument to the dead.

02:26:38.542 --> 02:26:41.707
It is also a reminder of the
valiant fighters of Sobibor

02:26:41.708 --> 02:26:43.249
who were among those who began

02:26:43.250 --> 02:26:48.207
to make the idea and the vow
never again a reality.
