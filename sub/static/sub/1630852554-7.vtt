GATES: I'm
Henry Louis Gates, Jr.

00:06.833 --> 00:09.166
Welcome to<i> 
Finding Your Roots.</i>

00:10.533 --> 00:13.209
In this episode, we'll
meet John Leguizamo

00:13.233 --> 00:14.976
and Lena Waithe.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.776
Two stars who built their
careers by exploring their

00:17.800 --> 00:22.742
identities are now going to
discover just how complex

00:22.766 --> 00:25.966
those identities really are.

00:27.233 --> 00:30.142
LEGUIZAMO: This is my
15th great-grandfather?

00:30.166 --> 00:31.409
GATES: How 'bout that?

00:31.433 --> 00:32.842
LEGUIZAMO: From coming from
no history to having so much

00:32.866 --> 00:35.876
history is, it's,
it's unbelievable.

00:35.900 --> 00:39.766
GATES: You descend from
a Native American woman.

00:40.766 --> 00:42.933
WAITHE: What?

00:44.000 --> 00:45.442
GATES: To uncover their roots,

00:45.466 --> 00:47.642
we've used every
tool available...

00:47.666 --> 00:50.076
Genealogists combed
through the paper trail

00:50.100 --> 00:52.042
their ancestors left behind,

00:52.066 --> 00:54.942
while DNA experts utilized
the latest advances in

00:54.966 --> 00:59.376
genetic analysis to reveal
secrets hundreds of years old.

00:59.400 --> 01:03.876
And we've compiled everything
into a book of life...

01:03.900 --> 01:05.009
WAITHE: Wow!

01:05.033 --> 01:06.976
GATES: A record of all
of our discoveries...

01:07.000 --> 01:08.876
LEGUIZAMO: Wow,
that's incredible.

01:08.900 --> 01:11.876
GATES: And a window
into the hidden past.

01:11.900 --> 01:13.742
WAITHE: This is crazy.

01:13.766 --> 01:14.876
LEGUIZAMO: I'm getting, uh...

01:14.900 --> 01:16.009
uh, teary-eyed here.

01:16.033 --> 01:19.466
Uh, yeah, it's beautiful.

01:19.666 --> 01:22.776
WAITHE: It feels like one big
huge blessing to be connected

01:22.800 --> 01:24.709
to all of these people.

01:24.733 --> 01:27.409
GATES: John and Lena grew up
in the United States,

01:27.433 --> 01:30.542
knowing almost nothing about
their ancestors who lived

01:30.566 --> 01:32.909
far from our shores.

01:32.933 --> 01:36.609
In this episode, they're
going to meet those ancestors,

01:36.633 --> 01:40.176
retrace their incredible
journeys, and uncover

01:40.200 --> 01:44.033
the hidden diversity within
their own family trees.

01:45.433 --> 01:50.400

02:21.633 --> 02:28.100
♪ ♪

02:31.766 --> 02:34.333
GATES: John Leguizamo
is a national treasure.

02:35.200 --> 02:36.976
Over the past three decades,

02:37.000 --> 02:39.609
he's carved out a unique path...

02:39.633 --> 02:42.876
Juggling leading roles in
film and television with

02:42.900 --> 02:46.366
his brilliant
self-created one-man shows...

02:48.333 --> 02:50.076
LEGUIZAMO: Yo Johnny,
don't be afraid, come on.

02:50.100 --> 02:53.676
Go Johnny, go Johnny,
go, go, go!

02:53.700 --> 02:57.476
Go me, go me,
go me, go me, go me.

02:57.500 --> 02:59.209
And I get to the
conductor's boof...

02:59.233 --> 03:02.176
Boof, that's how I used to talk.

03:02.200 --> 03:05.466
Baf-room, leng-ff, nor-ff.

03:05.900 --> 03:09.033
Yo, we were so ghetto we
couldn't even afford a T-H.

03:11.233 --> 03:14.709
GATES: On stage, John explores
the Latino experience from

03:14.733 --> 03:18.666
myriad angles, via a
dizzying array of characters.

03:19.800 --> 03:23.009
But it all feels firmly rooted
in his own experience,

03:23.033 --> 03:25.033
because it is.

03:27.766 --> 03:30.876
When he was four years old,
John's family emigrated from

03:30.900 --> 03:35.209
Bogotá, Colombia to Queens,
New York, where John grew up

03:35.233 --> 03:38.809
watching his parents make
immense efforts simply to

03:38.833 --> 03:41.466
put a roof over their heads.

03:42.166 --> 03:44.242
LEGUIZAMO: My parents were
always struggling and striving.

03:44.266 --> 03:46.909
I mean, when we first got
here, the four of us,

03:46.933 --> 03:49.909
we lived in an apartment that
was so small, the furniture

03:49.933 --> 03:51.576
was painted on the walls.

03:51.600 --> 03:52.642
And we had a Murphy bed.

03:52.666 --> 03:54.142
I don't know if
people, uh, you know, are...

03:54.166 --> 03:56.276
GATES: They have no idea what
a Murphy bed is, but tell 'em.

03:56.300 --> 03:57.509
LEGUIZAMO: Yeah. Yeah.

03:57.533 --> 03:59.042
You know, so, it's a bed
that's built so that when the

03:59.066 --> 04:01.676
day comes, in the morning, you
get up, you put it back up...

04:01.700 --> 04:02.610
GATES: Right.

04:02.634 --> 04:03.742
LEGUIZAMO: On the wall.

04:03.766 --> 04:05.676
So, you have a living room,
dining room, bedroom

04:05.700 --> 04:06.809
was all one room.

04:06.833 --> 04:08.109
That was the first year.

04:08.133 --> 04:09.942
The second year, my parents
worked their butts off so that

04:09.966 --> 04:11.609
they got their own room.

04:11.633 --> 04:14.542
And then eventually, we
had a living room separate

04:14.566 --> 04:15.809
from the dining room.

04:15.833 --> 04:17.676
And then, you know, every
year we moved up 'til we got a

04:17.700 --> 04:21.109
house, and then my father
rented all the rooms, and we

04:21.133 --> 04:24.109
had to live with all these
tenants, and we had to like,

04:24.133 --> 04:27.209
you know, clean their rooms
and do all, and do all kinds

04:27.233 --> 04:29.009
of, uh, manual labor.

04:29.033 --> 04:30.842
GATES: What effect do
you think that had on you?

04:30.866 --> 04:32.142
LEGUIZAMO: Well,
it made me rebel.

04:32.166 --> 04:33.342
It made me rebel against them.

04:33.366 --> 04:34.576
GATES: Mm-hmm.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.942
LEGUIZAMO: It made me very
anti-authority, because it,

04:36.966 --> 04:40.142
it, it was so strict at home,
and, and it made me, you know,

04:40.166 --> 04:44.742
love humor and comedy, and all
I wanted to do was be fun,

04:44.766 --> 04:47.233
be around fun, and having fun.

04:49.100 --> 04:51.876
GATES: John's
ambitions would quickly grow.

04:51.900 --> 04:54.942
He started out doing stand-up,
then discovered more

04:54.966 --> 04:58.366
serious theater, and was hooked.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.676
By the time he was 17, he was
reading Tennessee Williams and

05:02.700 --> 05:05.642
Arthur Miller, and telling
anyone who'd listen that

05:05.666 --> 05:08.766
he was going to become an actor.

05:09.366 --> 05:12.676
Perhaps unsurprisingly, this
wasn't what his parents

05:12.700 --> 05:15.076
wanted to hear...

05:15.100 --> 05:17.309
LEGUIZAMO: My father was
like: "We didn't come to this

05:17.333 --> 05:19.576
country for you to
be worse than us."

05:19.600 --> 05:22.709
You know, you, you can't be
an actor, don't, you, you know

05:22.733 --> 05:24.076
they were, they were horrified.

05:24.100 --> 05:25.809
I mean, first of all, you never
see Latin people on television

05:25.833 --> 05:28.376
or plays or anywhere,
so how are you gonna

05:28.400 --> 05:30.009
make a living?

05:30.033 --> 05:33.476
But I didn't care because I
fell in love with this, this,

05:33.500 --> 05:38.709
this calling, this, this, a
higher, uh, art, you know?

05:38.733 --> 05:40.909
I don't know, to me, it was
the greatest art the world had

05:40.933 --> 05:43.076
ever, ever created, and,
and so nothing was gonna

05:43.100 --> 05:44.800
derail me.

05:45.733 --> 05:47.842
GATES: John was
true to his word...

05:47.866 --> 05:49.742
After dropping out of college,

05:49.766 --> 05:53.833
he took acting classes at
New York's famed HB studio,

05:54.433 --> 05:57.642
then set his sights on
a career in Hollywood,

05:57.666 --> 06:01.566
where he soon confronted a
new challenge: typecasting.

06:02.866 --> 06:04.876
The only parts he could
get were gang members,

06:04.900 --> 06:08.466
drug dealers, or other
stereotypes of Latino men.

06:09.733 --> 06:13.742
The dilemma would ultimately
fuel his creativity, but not

06:13.766 --> 06:16.733
before a great deal
of soul-searching.

06:17.400 --> 06:19.376
LEGUIZAMO: How else was I
gonna make a living, you know?

06:19.400 --> 06:22.642
And I was hoping maybe this
is that, that stepping stone.

06:22.666 --> 06:25.376
Maybe this is that, that thing
that's gonna get me to the

06:25.400 --> 06:27.009
next better thing.

06:27.033 --> 06:28.442
But it wasn't, it was like...

06:28.466 --> 06:30.276
I would see all the cats.

06:30.300 --> 06:33.609
I would see Luis Guzmán,
Benjamin Bratt,

06:33.633 --> 06:36.676
Benicio del Toro, and all of us,
you know, coming in for

06:36.700 --> 06:39.009
gangsters with bandanas,
leather jackets, you know,

06:39.033 --> 06:40.209
"What's up man,
what's up, what's up?"

06:40.233 --> 06:41.476
Or janitors, you know,

06:41.500 --> 06:43.109
"Como... how are you doing,
how's everything going?

06:43.133 --> 06:44.010
Everything's good."

06:44.034 --> 06:46.576
You know? So...

06:46.600 --> 06:48.909
I started to
create my own stuff.

06:48.933 --> 06:52.609
And that, that rejection of
Hollywood, and, and Hollywood

06:52.633 --> 06:55.742
rejecting me, forced me to
find a new path for myself.

06:55.766 --> 06:57.009
GATES: Mm-hmm.

06:57.033 --> 06:58.276
LEGUIZAMO: And I'm grateful
for that rejection, because

06:58.300 --> 06:59.942
I now create.

06:59.966 --> 07:03.242
I'm self-generating, and uh,
I, I was, I've been able to be

07:03.266 --> 07:06.042
a voice for Latin kids
and Latin people, you know,

07:06.066 --> 07:09.542
showing that our culture is
valid, that it's viable, and

07:09.566 --> 07:13.000
that my ethnicity
is my, my power.

07:15.500 --> 07:18.276
GATES: My second guest is
actor, writer and producer

07:18.300 --> 07:22.009
Lena Waithe, creator of
Showtimes' hit series

07:22.033 --> 07:24.427
<i>The Chi,</i>

07:24.451 --> 07:26.866
a kaleidoscopic look
at Chicago's south side.

07:28.333 --> 07:31.266
It's a place that
Lena knows intimately.

07:31.866 --> 07:35.042
She spent most of her childhood
in the neighborhood...

07:35.066 --> 07:37.309
raised by a single mother,
who was often

07:37.333 --> 07:41.376
too busy to supervise her
closely and largely cut off

07:41.400 --> 07:45.100
from a father, who struggled
with substance abuse...

07:46.466 --> 07:49.109
But while Lena was certainly
shaped by the world outside

07:49.133 --> 07:53.333
her door, there was another
force that was just as strong:

07:53.966 --> 07:57.642
her maternal grandmother,
Tressie Hall, who lived with

07:57.666 --> 08:02.209
her, inspired her, and
even introduced her to

08:02.233 --> 08:05.233
her future profession.

08:05.633 --> 08:08.609
The two spent hours together
in front their television,

08:08.633 --> 08:12.166
guided by Tressie's
well-formed tastes...

08:13.066 --> 08:15.176
WAITHE: We watched a lot of
old TV because that's what my

08:15.200 --> 08:16.542
grandmother wanted to watch.

08:16.566 --> 08:17.676
Like but...

08:17.700 --> 08:18.742
GATES: Because she was old.

08:18.766 --> 08:20.009
WAITHE: Yeah,
because she was older.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.276
GATES: It wasn't old to her!

08:21.300 --> 08:23.342
WAITHE: She's like, "I like
this TV," you know, uhm, but

08:23.366 --> 08:26.376
we'd watch
<i>Hunter</i> 
and <i>Columbo
and, like, you know,</i> 
<i>Maude,</i>

08:26.400 --> 08:28.142
and, and <i>All in the Family.</i>

08:28.166 --> 08:33.542
And I just loved her sense of
humor, I loved her swag, and

08:33.566 --> 08:38.409
I enjoyed that time and, and
laughing with her and learning

08:38.433 --> 08:41.309
about just how important
storytelling could be

08:41.333 --> 08:44.033
through television shows.

08:44.633 --> 08:48.300
GATES: Lena's grandmother lit a
fire that has never gone out.

08:49.166 --> 08:52.209
After college, Lena moved
to Los Angeles, with no

08:52.233 --> 08:56.676
connections, and sought work
as a production assistant.

08:56.700 --> 08:58.876
The odds were
stacked against her,

08:58.900 --> 09:02.042
but Lena wasn't
thinking about that...

09:02.066 --> 09:05.609
GATES: Now, Hollywood is not
exactly known to be friendly

09:05.633 --> 09:07.376
to African Americans,
traditionally.

09:07.400 --> 09:08.642
WAITHE: No.

09:08.666 --> 09:10.676
GATES: How did you find it
when you, got here?

09:10.700 --> 09:12.742
WAITHE: At the time
there was a Black Hollywood.

09:12.766 --> 09:15.309
It was smaller, but
it was, it was there.

09:15.333 --> 09:17.442
And one of my professors said,
"If you can land in

09:17.466 --> 09:19.809
Black Hollywood,
you'll always be okay."

09:19.833 --> 09:21.576
It was like, and
so, I said, "Okay."

09:21.600 --> 09:25.709
And, uhm, yeah, my first
gig was on
<i>Girlfriends,</i> 
as an

09:25.733 --> 09:28.842
assistant to the showrunners,
and it was a dream come true.

09:28.866 --> 09:30.342
I was like, "Oh man,
this is, this is it.

09:30.366 --> 09:31.609
This is great."

09:31.633 --> 09:34.776
Uhm, and then, of course, a
strike hit, and everything

09:34.800 --> 09:37.409
kind of just came crumbling
down, and I was like,

09:37.433 --> 09:38.742
"What am I doing?"

09:38.766 --> 09:40.709
And that's when I think
when I got really creative and

09:40.733 --> 09:45.142
decided just to kind of write
and try to find my voice, and

09:45.166 --> 09:46.576
that's what I started to do.

09:46.600 --> 09:47.942
GATES: Was your
family supportive?

09:47.966 --> 09:49.242
WAITHE: Yeah, they were.

09:49.266 --> 09:52.109
The, the hard thing for them
was that they just didn't have

09:52.133 --> 09:54.976
any information, they couldn't
really help me because it's

09:55.000 --> 09:58.342
just a very tricky business,
and they knew they didn't know

09:58.366 --> 10:01.542
a ton about it, but they knew
that I had a lot of drive, and

10:01.566 --> 10:03.942
I was just going to try to
figure it out on my own.

10:03.966 --> 10:05.176
GATES: You're hard-headed.

10:05.200 --> 10:07.800
WAITHE: Yes, always have been.

10:08.900 --> 10:11.909
GATES: Lena's unwavering drive
has served her well,

10:11.933 --> 10:15.442
giving her the confidence to
stand up for her own story,

10:15.466 --> 10:18.242
onscreen and off.

10:18.266 --> 10:21.642
It's also led to an
amazing string of successes.

10:21.666 --> 10:27.776
Since 2017, she's won an Emmy,
created three TV shows,

10:27.800 --> 10:30.833
and written a feature film.

10:31.133 --> 10:33.609
But for all her
accomplishments, Lena remains

10:33.633 --> 10:36.676
very much a product of the
family that nurtured her

10:36.700 --> 10:40.100
dreams from the
very beginning...

10:41.233 --> 10:44.809
WAITHE: I wouldn't be here if
it weren't for their love and

10:44.833 --> 10:48.076
their support, and also, you
know, some of the dysfunction,

10:48.100 --> 10:52.076
and I think without that, I
don't have anything to draw,

10:52.100 --> 10:53.676
draw from.

10:53.700 --> 10:57.409
It wasn't all, it wasn't a
perfect upbringing, it wasn't,

10:57.433 --> 11:00.842
you know, it wasn't easy,

11:00.866 --> 11:04.942
and because of that, I'm,

11:04.966 --> 11:08.276
I have some wounds and
some scars that make me

11:08.300 --> 11:10.376
the artist and the writer I am.

11:10.400 --> 11:11.676
GATES: Uh-hum.

11:11.700 --> 11:13.209
WAITHE: So, I, you know, it's
interesting because I think

11:13.233 --> 11:16.209
some people say, you know, they
want trauma-free entertainment.

11:16.233 --> 11:17.376
GATES: Good luck with that.

11:17.400 --> 11:18.709
WAITHE: Exactly. It's like...

11:18.733 --> 11:20.776
GATES: Well, there is
no trauma-free author.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.309
WAITHE: Yeah, exactly.

11:22.333 --> 11:26.876
And so we have to find ways to
heal, and the way I choose to

11:26.900 --> 11:28.109
do that is to,

11:28.133 --> 11:31.033
to write about things that
aren't always pretty.

11:31.933 --> 11:35.176
GATES: Lena and John grew up
in homes where daily existence

11:35.200 --> 11:38.142
could be a struggle, in
families focused on the

11:38.166 --> 11:41.342
future, not on the past.

11:41.366 --> 11:45.276
As a result, though each has a
strong sense of themself,

11:45.300 --> 11:48.109
they have little knowledge
of the ancestors who laid

11:48.133 --> 11:50.776
the groundwork for
their success...

11:50.800 --> 11:53.200
It was time to change that.

11:54.033 --> 11:57.242
I started with John Leguizamo.

11:57.266 --> 12:00.609
Growing up in New York City,
far from his native Colombia,

12:00.633 --> 12:03.842
John's understanding of his
ancestry had been filtered

12:03.866 --> 12:07.609
through heavy layer of
mythology, as John himself

12:07.633 --> 12:09.876
readily admits...

12:09.900 --> 12:12.842
LEGUIZAMO: It's all, like, so
interesting in Latin America

12:12.866 --> 12:17.142
especially in my family, uh,
you know, uh, there's so many

12:17.166 --> 12:21.509
stories, you know, that, uh,

12:21.533 --> 12:24.709
my grandfather was Lebanese,

12:24.733 --> 12:31.142
part Lebanese, and, and
his wife was Afro Latina,

12:31.166 --> 12:34.442
and then my grandmother is
an Incan princess...

12:34.466 --> 12:36.376
GATES: You sound like,
uh, Black genealogy at a

12:36.400 --> 12:38.442
family reunion, you know?

12:38.466 --> 12:40.242
Yeah, a king in Africa!

12:40.266 --> 12:41.409
LEGUIZAMO: Yeah.

12:41.433 --> 12:43.642
There's, there's a lot of
fablizing about, about the

12:43.666 --> 12:46.566
story, but I don't
know the real, real deal.

12:47.733 --> 12:50.709
GATES: The "real deal" behind
John's family tree would prove

12:50.733 --> 12:54.909
fascinating, but it took our
researchers a lot of time to

12:54.933 --> 12:58.100
untangle it from
the "fablizing".

12:58.933 --> 13:01.476
On his mother's side, that
meant following the paper

13:01.500 --> 13:06.309
trail back almost three
centuries, all the way back to

13:06.333 --> 13:08.909
John's 6th great-grandfather,

13:08.933 --> 13:12.533
a man named Manuel
Salvador Londoño...

13:13.966 --> 13:16.776
Manuel was likely born in
Colombia sometime in the

13:16.800 --> 13:22.009
1720s, the key to his story,
and indeed to this entire

13:22.033 --> 13:24.409
branch of John's tree,

13:24.433 --> 13:28.033
lay in the archives of
the city of Rionegro.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.876
LEGUIZAMO: This is wild,
my sixth grandfather.

13:30.900 --> 13:34.876
GATES: Great-great-great-great-
great-great-grandfather.

13:34.900 --> 13:35.976
LEGUIZAMO: Wow.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.709
GATES: Now, look on the right.

13:37.733 --> 13:39.709
That is part of Manuel's will...

13:39.733 --> 13:40.742
LEGUIZAMO: Oh, wow!

13:40.766 --> 13:44.276
GATES: Recorded in
Rionegro in 1796.

13:44.300 --> 13:47.909
Would you please read the
section of your ancestor's.

13:47.933 --> 13:48.777
LEGUIZAMO: Oh my god.

13:48.801 --> 13:50.109
I hope there's something for me.

13:50.133 --> 13:53.009
I hope there's, I hope there's
a piece of land or some money.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.876
GATES: Would you please
read the section

13:54.900 --> 13:56.509
that we've translated?

13:56.533 --> 13:59.676
LEGUIZAMO: "Manuel Salvador
Londoño, natural son of

13:59.700 --> 14:01.876
Petrona de la Chica.

14:01.900 --> 14:04.709
He executed his will
before Public Notary

14:04.733 --> 14:09.933
Dr. Alvarez y Tamayo
on April 25, 1796."

14:10.533 --> 14:12.442
GATES: You notice anything
different about Manuel as he's

14:12.466 --> 14:14.576
described there?

14:14.600 --> 14:15.909
LEGUIZAMO: "Natural son."

14:15.933 --> 14:17.209
Oh, not legitimate.

14:17.233 --> 14:18.642
GATES: Yeah. Natural.

14:18.666 --> 14:19.909
LEGUIZAMO: Whoa!

14:19.933 --> 14:21.909
GATES: So, at the time of
Manuel's conception and birth,

14:21.933 --> 14:25.476
his parents were both
single and unmarried.

14:25.500 --> 14:29.476
LEGUIZAMO: You know, young
people can't control themselves.

14:29.500 --> 14:31.776
GATES: And as you could see,
there's no mention of the

14:31.800 --> 14:33.509
name of Manuel's father.

14:33.533 --> 14:34.742
LEGUIZAMO: No.

14:34.766 --> 14:36.342
GATES: And of course,
this was common for

14:36.366 --> 14:38.442
illegitimate children.

14:38.466 --> 14:40.109
LEGUIZAMO: He disappeared,
deadbeat dad.

14:40.133 --> 14:42.442
GATES: Let's find out.
Please turn the page.

14:42.466 --> 14:44.509
LEGUIZAMO: Who's the daddy?

14:44.533 --> 14:48.076
GATES: Ordinarily, it would
be impossible to identify the

14:48.100 --> 14:51.042
unnamed father of an
illegitimate child

14:51.066 --> 14:54.009
born in the 1720s.

14:54.033 --> 14:57.133
But we had an extraordinary
tool at our disposal.

14:58.266 --> 15:02.376
In the 18th century, priests
in Colombia often kept notes

15:02.400 --> 15:05.109
on events in their parishes.

15:05.133 --> 15:09.409
These notes were compiled
by an historian in 2006,

15:09.433 --> 15:13.176
providing an invaluable
resource for genealogists

15:13.200 --> 15:16.576
because the priests had a wide
array of interests, and were

15:16.600 --> 15:19.042
willing to preserve
gossip that was excluded

15:19.066 --> 15:21.333
from official records.

15:22.366 --> 15:25.076
Thanks to these priests, we
learned a great deal about

15:25.100 --> 15:29.442
John's ancestry, including the
identity of Manuel's father,

15:29.466 --> 15:32.800
a man named
Sancho Londoño Zapata.

15:34.700 --> 15:36.009
You ever heard that name?

15:36.033 --> 15:38.042
LEGUIZAMO: No.
I have never.

15:38.066 --> 15:42.042
GATES: Well, Sancho is your
seventh great-grandfather,

15:42.066 --> 15:45.109
and he was the corregidor
of Rionegro at the time,

15:45.133 --> 15:48.209
which meant he was the
local administrator for

15:48.233 --> 15:50.342
the Spanish crown.

15:50.366 --> 15:52.042
LEGUIZAMO: Oh wow, so
this is a Spaniard guy.

15:52.066 --> 15:53.076
This is a...

15:53.100 --> 15:54.509
GATES: He was a big deal, man.
Your sev...

15:54.533 --> 15:55.609
LEGUIZAMO: Yeah. Yeah.

15:55.633 --> 15:56.876
GATES: Let me tell
you how big he was.

15:56.900 --> 16:00.876
Your seventh great-grandfather,
when he died in 1765,

16:00.900 --> 16:04.576
was the richest
person in the entire province.

16:04.600 --> 16:07.209
LEGUIZAMO: No.
Get out of here.

16:07.233 --> 16:08.576
Where's my money?

16:08.600 --> 16:10.076
GATES: He was the corregidor.
That was his title.

16:10.100 --> 16:11.010
LEGUIZAMO: Yeah. Yeah.

16:11.034 --> 16:13.176
That's incredible.
That's incredible.

16:13.200 --> 16:15.542
GATES: Though John's 7th
great-grandfather was a

16:15.566 --> 16:19.676
powerful official, we know
little about his life, and

16:19.700 --> 16:22.442
nothing at all about his
relationship to John's

16:22.466 --> 16:25.376
7th great-grandmother,
a woman named

16:25.400 --> 16:28.633
Petronila de la Chica Betuma.

16:29.633 --> 16:34.076
But turning back to the compiled
notes of Rionegro's priests,

16:34.100 --> 16:37.409
we discovered
something about Petronila...

16:37.433 --> 16:39.733
She was a Native American.

16:41.066 --> 16:43.609
LEGUIZAMO: "Teresa de la Chica
Betuma was daughter of

16:43.633 --> 16:46.542
Miguel de la Chica, Indian."

16:46.566 --> 16:50.942
Oh, I had a feeling, and his
wife Francisca, he, he liked

16:50.966 --> 16:53.076
the flavor, a little.

16:53.100 --> 16:55.809
"And his wife, Francisca Betuma,
a marriage celebrated

16:55.833 --> 17:00.009
in Rionegro in April of 1673."

17:00.033 --> 17:01.876
That's nuts.

17:01.900 --> 17:04.109
At the same time, Francisca
was the daughter of don

17:04.133 --> 17:08.566
Jeronimo Betuma,
noble Indian of El Peñol.

17:09.200 --> 17:11.242
The daughters of Miguel de
la Chica and Francisca Betuma

17:11.266 --> 17:14.642
were Petronila de la Chica
and Teresa."

17:14.666 --> 17:16.276
GATES: John, according to
this source, your seventh

17:16.300 --> 17:18.676
great-grandmother
was Indigenous.

17:18.700 --> 17:21.076
LEGUIZAMO: Yeah, yeah, but I
knew, uh, look at me. Yeah.

17:21.100 --> 17:22.077
GATES: Yeah.

17:22.101 --> 17:23.442
LEGUIZAMO: It
came from somewhere.

17:23.466 --> 17:25.076
That's wild.

17:25.100 --> 17:28.009
GATES: And this introduces us
to her parents, who are your

17:28.033 --> 17:31.676
8th great-grandparents,
Miguel de la Chica and

17:31.700 --> 17:36.142
Francisca Betuma, who are
both recorded there as

17:36.166 --> 17:38.742
being also Indigenous.

17:38.766 --> 17:40.809
LEGUIZAMO: Yeah, In,
they just say Indian.

17:40.833 --> 17:42.309
Isn't that wild?
They just say Indian.

17:42.333 --> 17:43.609
GATES: Yes.

17:43.633 --> 17:48.176
You've also read the name of
your ninth great-grandfather,

17:48.200 --> 17:50.542
Jeronimo Betuma.

17:50.566 --> 17:52.709
LEGUIZAMO: I can't
believe we got a ninth,

17:52.733 --> 17:54.809
a ninth grandfather.

17:54.833 --> 17:57.866
What, are you going to go to
the beginning of time, I mean?

17:58.233 --> 18:01.042
From coming from no history
to having so much history is,

18:01.066 --> 18:02.676
it's, it's unbelievable.

18:02.700 --> 18:05.642
GATES: And read again
how he's described.

18:05.666 --> 18:07.409
LEGUIZAMO: "Noble Indian."

18:07.433 --> 18:10.409
GATES: "Noble Indian."

18:10.433 --> 18:12.609
LEGUIZAMO: That's beautiful.
It's very moving.

18:12.633 --> 18:14.800
I mean I'm very,
I'm, I'm, I'm moved.

18:15.700 --> 18:17.942
I'm getting uh,
uh, teary-eyed here.

18:17.966 --> 18:21.466
Uh, yeah, it's beautiful.

18:22.500 --> 18:24.609
I mean to...

18:24.633 --> 18:29.666
(Sighs).

18:30.233 --> 18:31.909
GATES: What's
it like to see that?

18:31.933 --> 18:34.809
LEGUIZAMO: Well, I feel
very proud, and I mean it's

18:34.833 --> 18:37.609
incredible to know that
that's where I get my

18:37.633 --> 18:39.342
Indigenous blood from.

18:39.366 --> 18:42.466
It's a, the direct name,
the direct person.

18:44.266 --> 18:47.042
GATES: We believe that
Jeronimo, was likely born

18:47.066 --> 18:51.633
sometime in the mid-1600s,
though we can't be certain,

18:52.300 --> 18:57.576
we found him in the census for
Rionegro for the year 1666,

18:57.600 --> 19:00.976
and that's as far as we
could go on this branch of

19:01.000 --> 19:03.233
John's family tree.

19:03.766 --> 19:06.409
However, we weren't done
with his mother's ancestry,

19:06.433 --> 19:09.333
not by a long shot...

19:09.700 --> 19:13.609
Focusing on another of John's
maternal lines, we were able to

19:13.633 --> 19:17.342
trace back to his 15th
great-grandfather,

19:17.366 --> 19:21.266
a man named
Sebastián de Belalcázar,

19:21.700 --> 19:24.109
whose life is exceedingly
well-documented

19:24.133 --> 19:26.709
for a man of this era.

19:26.733 --> 19:29.876
LEGUIZAMO: This is my
15th great-grandfather?

19:29.900 --> 19:30.942
GATES: How 'bout that?

19:30.966 --> 19:31.943
LEGUIZAMO: That's incredible.

19:31.967 --> 19:33.376
What, what, what
does that take us?

19:33.400 --> 19:35.609
Into the 1400s?

19:35.633 --> 19:41.200
GATES: He died around 1551,
in what today is Cartagena.

19:43.366 --> 19:44.676
LEGUIZAMO: Wow.

19:44.700 --> 19:47.042
GATES: Would you please
read the translated section?

19:47.066 --> 19:51.109
LEGUIZAMO: "I, Sebastián
de Belalcázar Adelantado,

19:51.133 --> 19:53.342
Governor", Governor!

19:53.366 --> 19:55.609
"and Captain-General of
these provinces and

19:55.633 --> 19:58.009
district of Popayán
for His Majesty,

19:58.033 --> 20:01.942
do grant and certify by this
instrument my full power of

20:01.966 --> 20:04.976
attorney to you,
Francisco de Rodas,

20:05.000 --> 20:07.609
in all my litigation,
civil or criminal.

20:07.633 --> 20:11.466
I grant this instrument before
the Notary in the city of Cali."

20:12.166 --> 20:15.376
GATES: Your 15th
great-grandfather was the

20:15.400 --> 20:20.542
governor and captain-general
of the District of Popayán

20:20.566 --> 20:23.176
for the King of Spain.

20:23.200 --> 20:25.142
His boss was the King of Spain.

20:25.166 --> 20:29.642
LEGUIZAMO: Wow.
I can't believe it.

20:29.666 --> 20:31.442
I, you could trace
me that far back.

20:31.466 --> 20:32.642
That's incredible.

20:32.666 --> 20:33.610
GATES: Mm-hmm.

20:33.634 --> 20:34.709
LEGUIZAMO: My, my
family's gonna, uh,

20:34.733 --> 20:36.176
use the term bug out.

20:36.200 --> 20:38.500
They're gonna
freak out and bug out.

20:39.200 --> 20:42.976
GATES: Neither John, nor his
family, was likely prepared

20:43.000 --> 20:46.233
for what we discovered next.

20:46.700 --> 20:49.776
Records show that
Sebastián served under

20:49.800 --> 20:53.509
Francisco Pizzaro, the
infamous conquistador who

20:53.533 --> 20:57.376
brutally subjugated
the Incan empire.

20:57.400 --> 21:02.376
Indeed, we found testimony
detailing how Pizzaro sent

21:02.400 --> 21:06.842
Sebastián into what is now
Ecuador to conquer the Incan

21:06.866 --> 21:11.366
city of Quito, and seize any
treasure that he could find.

21:12.933 --> 21:16.742
Much to John's chagrin,
Sebastián did exactly

21:16.766 --> 21:19.500
as he was told...

21:20.700 --> 21:23.876
Your ancestor was able to
obtain vast amounts of gold

21:23.900 --> 21:27.442
for Spain, your ancestor,

21:27.466 --> 21:29.209
not only from the
mines of the area,

21:29.233 --> 21:33.309
but he and his cohort
also melted down what

21:33.333 --> 21:35.842
Inca gold was left in the city.

21:35.866 --> 21:37.709
LEGUIZAMO: I mean, it's one
of the great crimes of, of

21:37.733 --> 21:39.042
history, you know?

21:39.066 --> 21:42.376
I mean the, the incredible
artifacts and, and, and the,

21:42.400 --> 21:44.476
and museum pieces
that were melted.

21:44.500 --> 21:45.742
GATES: Right.

21:45.766 --> 21:47.842
LEGUIZAMO: On one side, we
made them, and the other side,

21:47.866 --> 21:49.242
we melted them, you know?

21:49.266 --> 21:51.076
I'm, I'm, I'm kind,
I'm kind of like

21:51.100 --> 21:53.076
Dr. Jekyll and Hyde in here.

21:53.100 --> 21:56.309
GATES: How does it feel to
know that you descend,

21:56.333 --> 21:59.242
you have blood from,
you share DNA with...

21:59.266 --> 22:00.376
LEGUIZAMO: I, I...

22:00.400 --> 22:03.042
GATES: Both a
conquistador line

22:03.066 --> 22:05.876
and a noble Indigenous line.

22:05.900 --> 22:07.309
LEGUIZAMO: Yeah. Yeah.
I mean it's wild.

22:07.333 --> 22:09.842
I mean, you, you hear a lot
of, like, great Chicano poets,

22:09.866 --> 22:13.776
activists in the '60s going, I,
I conquered myself, you know?

22:13.800 --> 22:15.942
We, it's
basically that, you know?

22:15.966 --> 22:18.576
Here is my conquistador
grandfather and, and, and

22:18.600 --> 22:21.642
my Indigenous line, line, you
know, and they, they were at,

22:21.666 --> 22:25.509
at odds but also, you know,
mix, mixing up in the, in the,

22:25.533 --> 22:27.700
in the dark.

22:29.133 --> 22:31.442
GATES: There was one
more beat to this story.

22:31.466 --> 22:36.209
After the conquest of Quito,
Sebastian broke with Pizzaro

22:36.233 --> 22:40.176
and went north into what is
today Colombia, where,

22:40.200 --> 22:43.776
under license from the
Spanish crown, he won fame

22:43.800 --> 22:47.300
that would endure for centuries.

22:48.066 --> 22:50.676
LEGUIZAMO: No, get outta here.

22:50.700 --> 22:52.042
A statue.

22:52.066 --> 22:53.309
GATES: Yes.

22:53.333 --> 22:54.976
LEGUIZAMO: That's wild. Wow.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.176
GATES: It's located in
the city of Popayán,

22:57.200 --> 22:59.109
which he founded...

22:59.133 --> 23:00.676
LEGUIZAMO: Oh wow.

23:00.700 --> 23:02.809
GATES: In the year 1537,

23:02.833 --> 23:06.109
three years after the
conquest of Quito.

23:06.133 --> 23:10.466
And Popayán wasn't the
only city he founded.

23:10.833 --> 23:12.309
See that map?

23:12.333 --> 23:13.442
LEGUIZAMO: Yeah.

23:13.466 --> 23:15.242
GATES: Your ancestor
founded all of those cities.

23:15.266 --> 23:16.509
LEGUIZAMO: No!
That's amazing.

23:16.533 --> 23:18.576
I mean, those are big
cities in Colombia.

23:18.600 --> 23:20.442
GATES: Big cities.
LEGUIZAMO: Yeah.

23:20.466 --> 23:23.276
I mean it's, it's
so unfathomable.

23:23.300 --> 23:25.076
GATES: Well, guess what?

23:25.100 --> 23:28.509
A month ago, protesters
pulled this statue down.

23:28.533 --> 23:30.109
LEGUIZAMO: Oh, they did?

23:30.133 --> 23:31.242
GATES: Indigenous protesters.

23:31.266 --> 23:33.076
LEGUIZAMO: I had a
feeling it had to go.

23:33.100 --> 23:35.276
GATES: A month ago,
in September.

23:35.300 --> 23:36.409
LEGUIZAMO: Oh, man.

23:36.433 --> 23:37.509
I hope they put it in a museum.

23:37.533 --> 23:39.076
I mean, maybe it
doesn't need to be...

23:39.100 --> 23:41.609
I mean, I'm not against that.
I understand...

23:41.633 --> 23:42.876
GATES: Sure.

23:42.900 --> 23:45.842
LEGUIZAMO: The horrors of
destroying a people's culture,

23:45.866 --> 23:47.342
language, and religion.

23:47.366 --> 23:48.976
And stealing all that they
had, and now they're living

23:49.000 --> 23:51.409
in, in, in, in squalor.

23:51.433 --> 23:54.642
Yeah, no, I'm not, I'm not for
that, you know what I mean?

23:54.666 --> 23:56.342
GATES: Well, I mean, he
was a big target, right?

23:56.366 --> 23:57.776
LEGUIZAMO: Yeah. Yeah.

23:57.800 --> 24:00.766
But I'm glad you
got that photo quick.

24:03.933 --> 24:07.342
GATES: Much like John, my
second guest, Lena Waithe,

24:07.366 --> 24:11.142
was about to follow her roots
back centuries to meet ancestors

24:11.166 --> 24:15.100
whose stories, and identities,
had been lost to time.

24:16.166 --> 24:19.042
But this journey began
much closer to home:

24:19.066 --> 24:22.866
with Lena's father,
Lawrence David Waithe...

24:23.800 --> 24:27.376
Lawrence separated from Lena's
mother when Lena was a child,

24:27.400 --> 24:30.042
and though he remained in
her life for several years

24:30.066 --> 24:33.309
afterwards, he died young...

24:33.333 --> 24:37.133
Leaving his daughter with a
host of unanswered questions.

24:38.766 --> 24:40.476
WAITHE: He came around on
weekends, you know, for a

24:40.500 --> 24:44.009
little while, and then, and
that was cool, and it was

24:44.033 --> 24:47.209
totally normal, and then it
stopped, and I didn't really

24:47.233 --> 24:50.509
understand why, and I think
there were things that were

24:50.533 --> 24:53.709
going on that maybe they
didn't think a child should

24:53.733 --> 24:58.176
know, so all I knew was the,
the weekend visits stopped,

24:58.200 --> 25:03.266
and, and then, when I was
15, uh, he died suddenly.

25:03.600 --> 25:04.776
GATES: Yeah.

25:04.800 --> 25:06.709
WAITHE: And I just sort of
didn't know, I didn't know

25:06.733 --> 25:07.976
what to make of it.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.976
It's just a very
odd thing to hear.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.109
Even if you haven't seen a
parent in a long time, there's

25:12.133 --> 25:15.876
still something that shifts in
the universe that a person who

25:15.900 --> 25:19.676
helped make you
is no longer here.

25:19.700 --> 25:22.976
And I think I was just sort of
very lost and didn't know what

25:23.000 --> 25:26.442
to make of it, uh, and
I think I still don't.

25:26.466 --> 25:28.609
GATES: You carry
the Waithe name.

25:28.633 --> 25:29.909
Do you know where it comes from?

25:29.933 --> 25:31.866
WAITHE: I do not.

25:32.866 --> 25:37.109
GATES: Lena's father was
born in Boston in 1951.

25:37.133 --> 25:40.176
As we set out to trace his
roots, we expected that they

25:40.200 --> 25:43.076
would lead us into the
American south, as do the

25:43.100 --> 25:46.642
roots of most of my
African American guests.

25:46.666 --> 25:50.209
And, indeed, Lawrence's mother
has ancestry in Tennessee,

25:50.233 --> 25:53.142
Alabama and Georgia.

25:53.166 --> 25:55.609
But when we turned to
Lawrence's father, we found

25:55.633 --> 26:00.942
ourselves in New York City,
where, in 1921, a man named

26:00.966 --> 26:04.733
Winston Waithe
stepped off a ship.

26:05.600 --> 26:08.776
Winston is Lena's
great-grandfather.

26:08.800 --> 26:11.476
And, according to the
passenger list of his ship,

26:11.500 --> 26:15.442
he wasn't coming to New York
from Charleston, or New Orleans,

26:15.466 --> 26:18.409
or anywhere in
the United States.

26:18.433 --> 26:23.309
He, and this whole line of
Lena's ancestry, was from

26:23.333 --> 26:26.900
Barbados, in the West Indies.

26:28.733 --> 26:31.376
WAITHE: Wow. Barbados.

26:31.400 --> 26:33.076
GATES: So, you had no
idea of any of this?

26:33.100 --> 26:34.376
WAITHE: No.

26:34.400 --> 26:35.909
GATES: Nothing, where they came
from or how they came to the,

26:35.933 --> 26:37.676
well, obviously, if you didn't
know where they came from,

26:37.700 --> 26:38.742
you hadn't ever...

26:38.766 --> 26:39.710
WAITHE: Yeah.

26:39.734 --> 26:40.742
GATES: Thought about
how they got here.

26:40.766 --> 26:41.909
WAITHE: Absolutely.

26:41.933 --> 26:44.109
GATES: What's it like
for you to see that?

26:44.133 --> 26:45.442
WAITHE: That's the interesting
thing, I never thought of my

26:45.466 --> 26:46.876
ancestors as immigrants.

26:46.900 --> 26:48.142
GATES: Oh, right.

26:48.166 --> 26:49.942
WAITHE: Yeah, because, you
know, you know, we, you think,

26:49.966 --> 26:51.976
well, we didn't
want to come here.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.542
You know, there's a
difference, you know, being

26:53.566 --> 26:55.876
brought over here against
your will versus, you know,

26:55.900 --> 26:57.476
choosing to come,

26:57.500 --> 26:59.376
so I think that's the
most shocking thing.

26:59.400 --> 27:01.242
GATES: Yeah, we were
unwilling immigrants, right?

27:01.266 --> 27:02.176
WAITHE: Yeah.

27:02.200 --> 27:03.177
GATES: Not you.

27:03.201 --> 27:06.309
WAITHE: Yeah, I know.
So interesting.

27:06.333 --> 27:10.242
GATES: In Winston's day,
Barbados was an English colony,

27:10.266 --> 27:12.142
and Lena wondered why
her ancestor would leave

27:12.166 --> 27:15.900
his homeland to take a
chance in segregated America.

27:17.066 --> 27:20.866
The answer, it seems,
was economic...

27:22.266 --> 27:25.242
WAITHE: "The Barbados have
become so full of people that

27:25.266 --> 27:29.142
the English government offers
a cash bonus to any inhabitant

27:29.166 --> 27:32.042
who will agree to leave
the island and stay away

27:32.066 --> 27:33.576
for five years."

27:33.600 --> 27:37.176
"Ordinarily, the offer is $20,
but when Barbados people are

27:37.200 --> 27:40.709
least inclined to leave their
island it is raised to $25."

27:40.733 --> 27:42.842
Wow.

27:42.866 --> 27:44.609
So, they were kind
of bribed to go away?

27:44.633 --> 27:45.642
GATES: Yeah.

27:45.666 --> 27:46.876
WAITHE: Wow.

27:46.900 --> 27:48.309
GATES: They had an
overcrowding problem,

27:48.333 --> 27:51.109
and they go, "Here's 25 bucks,
you know, like you all..."

27:51.133 --> 27:51.909
WAITHE: "Get out."

27:51.933 --> 27:52.843
GATES: "Get out," right?

27:52.867 --> 27:54.242
WAITHE: "Go somewhere." Wow.

27:54.266 --> 27:56.376
GATES: The English government
was paying people to leave.

27:56.400 --> 27:57.609
And I didn't even know.

27:57.633 --> 27:59.009
I mean, until we did the
research of your family tree,

27:59.033 --> 28:01.042
I didn't even know that
anybody was doing this.

28:01.066 --> 28:03.466
WAITHE: This is crazy.

28:04.933 --> 28:08.242
GATES: Winston was 17 years
old when he left Barbados.

28:08.266 --> 28:11.109
But the cash offer wasn't
the only incentive

28:11.133 --> 28:13.376
drawing him north.

28:13.400 --> 28:15.909
Wages were higher in
the United States.

28:15.933 --> 28:18.876
And there may have been
another factor as well:

28:18.900 --> 28:23.042
Winston wasn't the first in
his family to make the move.

28:23.066 --> 28:25.242
As evidenced by the
passenger list of the ship

28:25.266 --> 28:28.133
that brought him here.

28:28.400 --> 28:31.509
WAITHE: "Whether going to join
a relative or friend, father,

28:31.533 --> 28:34.876
Mr. E. Waithe,
123 Houston Street

28:34.900 --> 28:36.742
Cambridge, Massachusetts."

28:36.766 --> 28:38.176
GATES: So, you know
what's going on here?

28:38.200 --> 28:40.142
Your great-grandfather Winston
came to the United States on

28:40.166 --> 28:42.042
his way to be with his father...

28:42.066 --> 28:43.109
WAITHE: Oh.

28:43.133 --> 28:44.043
GATES: Who was already here.

28:44.067 --> 28:45.209
WAITHE: Got it.

28:45.233 --> 28:47.476
GATES: Your great-great
grandfather Edward Waithe,

28:47.500 --> 28:51.342
who was living in my beloved
Cambridge, Massachusetts,

28:51.366 --> 28:53.476
not that far from my house.

28:53.500 --> 28:55.176
WAITHE: Wow.

28:55.200 --> 28:56.676
GATES: So, your
great-grandfather wasn't the

28:56.700 --> 28:59.376
first immigrant on
your family tree.

28:59.400 --> 29:01.976
WAITHE: Hmm. Wow.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.676
GATES: What's it like to learn
this information about

29:04.700 --> 29:08.309
two generations of
your blood ancestors?

29:08.333 --> 29:11.976
WAITHE: I mean, it's,
it's really beautiful.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.109
It feels like I have a sense
of, a newer sense of identity.

29:15.133 --> 29:16.942
GATES: So, are you
going to visit Barbados?

29:16.966 --> 29:19.409
WAITHE: I must, for sure.
I can't wait.

29:19.433 --> 29:20.842
GATES: And you probably have
cousins all over there, and

29:20.866 --> 29:23.476
I bet they're looking
at your film saying...

29:23.500 --> 29:25.776
WAITHE: They're like,
"You look familiar."

29:25.800 --> 29:27.933
Wow.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.909
GATES: We now set out to
see what we could learn about

29:31.933 --> 29:35.733
Lena's roots in her
newfound ancestral home.

29:36.466 --> 29:39.076
We knew that we faced
a steep challenge...

29:39.100 --> 29:41.976
Doing genealogy in the West
Indies can be very difficult

29:42.000 --> 29:44.900
because many vital
records have been lost.

29:46.100 --> 29:49.166
But in Lena's
case, we got lucky.

29:49.633 --> 29:53.442
We uncovered a wedding
record from the year 1880

29:53.466 --> 29:56.676
that allowed us to add
two more generations to

29:56.700 --> 29:59.133
her family tree...

29:59.500 --> 30:02.542
WAITHE: "The Parish
Church of Christ Church.

30:02.566 --> 30:04.909
When married, March 27.

30:04.933 --> 30:08.676
Name and surname, William
Moore Waithe, age 38 and

30:08.700 --> 30:11.909
Charlotte Ann Warner, age 37.

30:11.933 --> 30:14.709
Father's name and
surname, Primus Waithe."

30:14.733 --> 30:17.609
GATES: William Moore Waithe is
your third great-grandfather.

30:17.633 --> 30:22.376
He was born almost
200 years ago in 1830

30:22.400 --> 30:24.642
in Christ Church Barbados.

30:24.666 --> 30:27.576
And you just read the name of
his father, Primus Waithe.

30:27.600 --> 30:28.642
WAITHE: Wow.

30:28.666 --> 30:29.809
GATES: Primus Waithe is your

30:29.833 --> 30:32.242
great-great-great-
great-grandfather.

30:32.266 --> 30:33.642
WAITHE: Wow.

30:33.666 --> 30:38.366
GATES: He was born
around 1792 also in Barbados.

30:38.800 --> 30:40.176
Remember when George
Washington was president of

30:40.200 --> 30:41.742
the United States?

30:41.766 --> 30:44.309
WAITHE: Oh, man, it's amazing.

30:44.333 --> 30:45.277
Yes.

30:45.301 --> 30:46.676
GATES: Your fourth
great-grandfather.

30:46.700 --> 30:48.309
WAITHE: I love
that name, Primus.

30:48.333 --> 30:49.310
GATES: Primus, it's cool.

30:49.334 --> 30:51.400
WAITHE: That's a strong name.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.209
GATES: This record not only
lists the names of Lena's

30:54.233 --> 30:58.342
direct ancestors, it places
them in a specific parish in

30:58.366 --> 31:02.233
Barbados, a parish
known as Christ Church...

31:03.066 --> 31:04.942
And this would tie Lena to a

31:04.966 --> 31:08.400
terrible chapter in
Barbados' history.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.642
As we pored over the
archives of Christ Church,

31:11.666 --> 31:16.176
we discovered a slave register
from the year 1817,

31:16.200 --> 31:20.842
indicating that Lena's fourth
great-grandfather Primus was

31:20.866 --> 31:25.866
the human property of someone
with a very familiar name...

31:27.500 --> 31:32.176
He was enslaved by a woman
named Mary Murrell Waithe.

31:32.200 --> 31:34.109
WAITHE: Whoa.

31:34.133 --> 31:37.176
GATES: And that is where
you get your surname from.

31:37.200 --> 31:38.909
WAITHE: Wow.

31:38.933 --> 31:40.642
GATES: The Waithe family.

31:40.666 --> 31:42.242
WAITHE: It was always
such an odd last name,

31:42.266 --> 31:43.509
like, growing up.

31:43.533 --> 31:44.742
GATES: Mhm.

31:44.766 --> 31:46.676
WAITHE: It wasn't like the
other, like other Black kids

31:46.700 --> 31:49.376
I was around, like, like
Washington or Johnson,

31:49.400 --> 31:51.442
and things like that, it was
always a, people always

31:51.466 --> 31:54.442
struggled with
spelling it, pronouncing it.

31:54.466 --> 31:57.909
Like, I was just always trying
to tell people understand it,

31:57.933 --> 31:59.842
but I, yeah, wow.

31:59.866 --> 32:01.976
GATES: What's it
like finally to know?

32:02.000 --> 32:08.466
WAITHE: You know, it's all,
it's, it's painful because

32:09.300 --> 32:12.942
your name is such a huge
part of your identity,

32:12.966 --> 32:17.909
so for someone to put their
identity onto your family,

32:17.933 --> 32:22.133
it just feels, uh, unjust.

32:23.233 --> 32:27.209
GATES: Lena's family wasn't
alone: over the course of the

32:27.233 --> 32:31.342
transatlantic slave trade,
roughly 600,000 Africans were

32:31.366 --> 32:33.509
shipped to Barbados.

32:33.533 --> 32:37.142
More than came to the
entire United States.

32:37.166 --> 32:40.609
Most ended up on sugar
plantations, where conditions

32:40.633 --> 32:43.542
were utterly hellish...

32:43.566 --> 32:47.609
Scholars told us that Primus
likely worked six days a week,

32:47.633 --> 32:53.109
doing 12 hour shifts of the
hardest labor, clearing land,

32:53.133 --> 32:57.009
digging holes, and cutting
the sugar cane, all the while

32:57.033 --> 33:00.666
dealing with oppressive
heat and poor sanitation.

33:01.933 --> 33:05.942
It was both terrifying, and
deadly, as massive numbers

33:05.966 --> 33:10.533
died of exhaustion,
starvation, and disease.

33:11.166 --> 33:13.776
Indeed: the average life
expectancy of an enslaved

33:13.800 --> 33:17.142
male worker on a sugar
plantation was between

33:17.166 --> 33:20.333
seven and nine years...

33:21.800 --> 33:24.976
Before the opening of the
West Indies and the growing

33:25.000 --> 33:26.842
cultivation of sugar there...

33:26.866 --> 33:28.009
WAITHE: Uh-hum.

33:28.033 --> 33:30.076
GATES: Only rich people in
Europe could have sugar.

33:30.100 --> 33:31.476
WAITHE: Oh, wow.

33:31.500 --> 33:33.509
GATES: The West Indies
made sugar the world's

33:33.533 --> 33:35.142
first commodity crop.

33:35.166 --> 33:36.342
WAITHE: Wow.

33:36.366 --> 33:37.876
GATES: And sugar was gold.

33:37.900 --> 33:42.142
People made vast fortunes,
but to harvest that sugar,

33:42.166 --> 33:45.376
they needed free, cheap labor.

33:45.400 --> 33:48.009
And that labor, of
course, came from Africa.

33:48.033 --> 33:49.076
WAITHE: Yeah.

33:49.100 --> 33:51.742
GATES: What's it like
to hear those numbers?

33:51.766 --> 33:57.176
WAITHE: Just to think about
their lives and them not being

33:57.200 --> 34:02.609
able to explore themselves or
step into themselves or

34:02.633 --> 34:06.909
have the time to get to know
themselves because they were

34:06.933 --> 34:09.809
just being worked
to death, literally.

34:09.833 --> 34:11.833
GATES: Mmm.

34:12.600 --> 34:17.676
WAITHE: It's, it's devastating,
and it's so disturbing.

34:17.700 --> 34:19.976
It doesn't matter how
much of it you read,

34:20.000 --> 34:26.609
you're still, I think there's
just a level of, uh,

34:26.633 --> 34:31.342
just of not being able
to understand that will,

34:31.366 --> 34:34.276
I don't think it will ever come.

34:34.300 --> 34:37.666
It's not meant to be understood.

34:39.100 --> 34:41.509
GATES: Slavery dominated
Barbados for more than

34:41.533 --> 34:44.609
two centuries, but the
Africans who were caught up

34:44.633 --> 34:49.109
in this ruthless system
didn't succumb in silence.

34:49.133 --> 34:51.642
There were many
acts of resistance,

34:51.666 --> 34:53.842
both small and large...

34:53.866 --> 34:58.600
And, in the spring of 1816,
one of them shook the world.

35:01.233 --> 35:04.442
WAITHE: "On Easter Sunday,
April 14, an insurrection of

35:04.466 --> 35:06.976
the slaves at
Barbados broke out.

35:07.000 --> 35:10.042
An account received on Monday
states that 41 estates were

35:10.066 --> 35:12.842
actually destroyed, and that
the insurrection appeared to

35:12.866 --> 35:16.442
be very extensive, and
the slaves most ferocious.

35:16.466 --> 35:18.609
The Negroes first
proceeded to demolish

35:18.633 --> 35:20.409
the overseers' houses.

35:20.433 --> 35:22.009
They then destroyed the
sugar-pans and all the

35:22.033 --> 35:24.176
implements, which they could
gain possession of,

35:24.200 --> 35:26.766
also all the Negro huts."

35:27.333 --> 35:32.200
Wow. Wow.

35:33.166 --> 35:35.533
Well, be still my heart.

35:36.433 --> 35:38.476
Wow.

35:38.500 --> 35:40.966
Well, I love that.

35:42.066 --> 35:45.242
GATES: The "insurrection," as
newspapers called it, came to

35:45.266 --> 35:49.042
be known as Bussa's Rebellion,
the biggest slave revolt in

35:49.066 --> 35:51.709
the history of Barbados.

35:51.733 --> 35:54.409
It lasted three days before
it was put down by the

35:54.433 --> 35:59.242
British army, leaving dozens of
plantations destroyed and

35:59.266 --> 36:02.576
miles of sugar fields burned.

36:02.600 --> 36:05.042
Lena's fourth
great-grandfather was

36:05.066 --> 36:07.642
24 years old at the time.

36:07.666 --> 36:10.776
He likely knew about the
plans, and he most certainly

36:10.800 --> 36:14.376
saw smoke from the burning
fields, but we don't believe

36:14.400 --> 36:18.042
that he played an active role
in the revolt, for one very

36:18.066 --> 36:21.766
simple reason, he survived.

36:23.366 --> 36:25.342
Although Christ Church
was one of the parishes

36:25.366 --> 36:29.042
impacted by the rebellion, all
people who were known to have

36:29.066 --> 36:33.142
participated were executed,
but Primus wasn't,

36:33.166 --> 36:35.809
Primus lived to father your
third great-grandfather

36:35.833 --> 36:37.542
William in 1830.

36:37.566 --> 36:38.809
WAITHE: Wow.

36:38.833 --> 36:41.509
GATES: If Primus had been
involved, we would just erase

36:41.533 --> 36:44.509
you right now and you
would just disappear.

36:44.533 --> 36:48.200
WAITHE: Wow. Wow.

36:49.733 --> 36:53.742
Whew. Wow.

36:53.766 --> 36:55.776
GATES: What do you
make of all this?

36:55.800 --> 37:01.509
WAITHE: Oh, it's so
interesting because I wonder

37:01.533 --> 37:08.000
if he wanted to be involved
but was too afraid or, wow.

37:09.200 --> 37:13.109
I'm sure there was some
survivor's remorse, uhm,

37:13.133 --> 37:15.009
but I'm grateful he did.

37:15.033 --> 37:17.300
GATES: I'm
grateful he did, too.

37:17.633 --> 37:21.042
Lena, unfortunately, Primus
would never know freedom.

37:21.066 --> 37:22.209
WAITHE: Oh.

37:22.233 --> 37:26.342
GATES: He would never ever
be released from bondage.

37:26.366 --> 37:31.976
He died enslaved in Barbados
sometime between 1829 and

37:32.000 --> 37:35.042
1832, and slavery is not
abolished throughout the

37:35.066 --> 37:37.776
British Empire until 1834,

37:37.800 --> 37:41.233
so just before the
Abolition of Slavery.

37:43.000 --> 37:46.042
WAITHE: It would've been
beautiful if he could've

37:46.066 --> 37:50.276
seen that, but I'm happy,

37:50.300 --> 37:52.576
but I'm happy he saw
the fires instead.

37:52.600 --> 37:54.800
GATES: Yep.

37:56.733 --> 37:59.509
We had a final detail to share.

37:59.533 --> 38:01.976
The same archives in Christ
Church that held a record of

38:02.000 --> 38:06.176
Primus' enslavement also
held another record,

38:06.200 --> 38:09.466
of a far more
optimistic nature...

38:10.433 --> 38:14.176
WAITHE: "When born,
1867, August 8.

38:14.200 --> 38:17.476
Child's Christian name,
Edward Albert.

38:17.500 --> 38:19.376
Surname, Waithe."

38:19.400 --> 38:21.709
GATES: Any idea what
you're looking at?

38:21.733 --> 38:24.333
WAITHE: I don't.

38:24.800 --> 38:27.176
GATES: That's the
baptismal record for your

38:27.200 --> 38:28.642
great-great-grandfather...

38:28.666 --> 38:29.709
WAITHE: Oh, wow.

38:29.733 --> 38:30.876
GATES: Edward Waithe.

38:30.900 --> 38:33.142
Edward Waithe was
Primus's grandson.

38:33.166 --> 38:34.676
WAITHE: Wow.

38:34.700 --> 38:37.509
GATES: And he wasn't only the
first immigrant ancestor on

38:37.533 --> 38:40.876
your Waithe line, remember
he comes to Boston in 1905?

38:40.900 --> 38:42.142
WAITHE: Uh-hum.

38:42.166 --> 38:45.109
GATES: He was also the first
person on your family tree,

38:45.133 --> 38:47.509
on the Waithe line,
to be born free.

38:47.533 --> 38:54.066
WAITHE: Wow. Wow. 1867.

38:54.733 --> 38:56.509
GATES: Does it change the
way you think of your father's

38:56.533 --> 38:59.142
family and your
relationship to it?

38:59.166 --> 39:02.300
I mean, are you
more of a Waithe now?

39:03.266 --> 39:05.309
WAITHE: I'm happy I know
where the name comes from.

39:05.333 --> 39:08.809
Um, I think I'm mostly filled
with gratitude for all these

39:08.833 --> 39:13.376
amazing human beings who,
you know, lived and worked and

39:13.400 --> 39:18.800
raised their children, and
uh, fought, and survived.

39:20.433 --> 39:23.009
GATES: The key word, survived.

39:23.033 --> 39:26.333
WAITHE: Yeah.
By the skin of their teeth.

39:27.700 --> 39:30.876
GATES: We'd already traced John
Leguizamo's mother's family

39:30.900 --> 39:34.109
back to the early 1500s,
revealing his

39:34.133 --> 39:37.442
ancient roots in
his native Colombia.

39:37.466 --> 39:41.042
Now, turning to his paternal
ancestry, we found ourselves

39:41.066 --> 39:43.676
facing a mystery.

39:43.700 --> 39:46.176
Growing up, John knew
his father's mother,

39:46.200 --> 39:50.809
María Emilia Leguizamo, but
never met his father's father,

39:50.833 --> 39:55.200
his own grandfather, he
didn't even know his name.

39:56.133 --> 39:59.733
We were starting,
essentially, from scratch...

40:00.933 --> 40:03.276
Have you ever heard much
about your grandfather?

40:03.300 --> 40:05.509
LEGUIZAMO: I, I mean the only
thing I heard was that he was

40:05.533 --> 40:09.576
a chicken farmer, and
he had a lot of kids.

40:09.600 --> 40:11.542
GATES: Mm-hmm.

40:11.566 --> 40:12.876
What do you know about
his relationship

40:12.900 --> 40:14.509
to your grandmother?

40:14.533 --> 40:16.776
LEGUIZAMO: To my grandma?

40:16.800 --> 40:20.309
Well, I, I think, I don't know.

40:20.333 --> 40:21.509
GATES: Mm-hmm.

40:21.533 --> 40:24.309
LEGUIZAMO: I, I don't, I
have no, no stories of him.

40:24.333 --> 40:26.376
I, I don't really have,
nothing was passed down

40:26.400 --> 40:28.076
to me about him.

40:28.100 --> 40:32.009
I think my father and him were
estranged, and uh, so, I, I,

40:32.033 --> 40:34.666
I, I, I knew, I knew nothing.

40:36.033 --> 40:38.776
GATES: Lacking first-hand
knowledge, John told me that

40:38.800 --> 40:42.309
he had long ago made an
assumption: he believed his

40:42.333 --> 40:44.442
grandfather was Puerto Rican,

40:44.466 --> 40:47.609
based on the fact that there's
a barrio called "Leguizamo"

40:47.633 --> 40:51.009
in one of Puerto Rico's
largest cities.

40:51.033 --> 40:55.076
But we could find no evidence
of John's family on the island,

40:55.100 --> 40:59.700
and his DNA does not show any
trace of Puerto Rican heritage.

41:01.166 --> 41:04.909
Instead, John's father's roots
lie in the same place as his

41:04.933 --> 41:07.942
mother's: Colombia...

41:07.966 --> 41:11.576
And the solution to the
mystery lay in the nexus

41:11.600 --> 41:15.966
between his grandfather's
name, and his unusual life...

41:17.900 --> 41:21.609
LEGUIZAMO: "Name of deceased,
Martin Vargas-Cualla,

41:21.633 --> 41:27.576
place of death, Houston, Texas,
date of death, July 29, 1975.

41:27.600 --> 41:30.642
Occupation,

41:33.300 --> 41:35.376
citizen of what country,
Colombia."

41:35.400 --> 41:36.976
GATES: Have you
ever seen that before?

41:37.000 --> 41:38.576
LEGUIZAMO: No.
Who is that?

41:38.600 --> 41:39.976
GATES: John, this is
the death certificate of

41:40.000 --> 41:41.809
your grandfather.

41:41.833 --> 41:43.376
LEGUIZAMO: Oh wow.

41:43.400 --> 41:47.376
GATES: He died in Houston,
Texas, on July 29, 1975.

41:47.400 --> 41:49.309
He was 80 years old.

41:49.333 --> 41:52.242
LEGUIZAMO: Now, now,
why don't I have, I'm not,

41:52.266 --> 41:53.976
he's not Legui, Leguizamo.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.109
GATES: Right.

41:55.133 --> 41:56.376
LEGUIZAMO: He's Vargas.

41:56.400 --> 41:58.209
I'm not Vargas.
I'm Leguizamo.

41:58.233 --> 42:01.376
GATES: Your grandmother
was not married to Martin.

42:01.400 --> 42:02.576
LEGUIZAMO: Oh, there you go.

42:02.600 --> 42:03.876
GATES: Okay?

42:03.900 --> 42:05.576
She was one of several women
with whom he had children and

42:05.600 --> 42:07.776
who lived at his properties.

42:07.800 --> 42:10.909
LEGUIZAMO: Oh, wow, my, my
grandmother lived in his,

42:10.933 --> 42:12.109
one of his properties?

42:12.133 --> 42:12.909
GATES: Yes.

42:12.933 --> 42:13.810
LEGUIZAMO: Oh, okay.

42:13.834 --> 42:15.109
GATES: Yeah.

42:15.133 --> 42:16.209
LEGUIZAMO: So, we didn't take
my grandfather's name 'cause

42:16.233 --> 42:17.542
that, otherwise I'd be a Vargas.

42:17.566 --> 42:18.709
GATES: You got it.

42:18.733 --> 42:19.876
LEGUIZAMO: Uh-huh.

42:19.900 --> 42:21.176
GATES: But she was there.
She was living...

42:21.200 --> 42:22.976
she had children on
his property, but...

42:23.000 --> 42:24.542
LEGUIZAMO: He
didn't claim them.

42:24.566 --> 42:26.342
He didn't claim, he didn't,
he didn't claim my father.

42:26.366 --> 42:27.642
GATES: Yeah. Right.

42:27.666 --> 42:28.643
LEGUIZAMO: Yeah.

42:28.667 --> 42:29.842
That's where all the
confusion comes...

42:29.866 --> 42:32.242
GATES: There you go.
You got it.

42:32.266 --> 42:33.376
LEGUIZAMO: So, I
should be a Vargas.

42:33.400 --> 42:35.309
I should be John Alberto Vargas.

42:35.333 --> 42:36.376
Johnny Vargas.

42:36.400 --> 42:37.377
GATES: Johnny Vargas.

42:37.401 --> 42:39.433
LEGUIZAMO: Johnny Vargas.

42:40.733 --> 42:43.142
GATES: This record indicates
that John's grandfather

42:43.166 --> 42:44.776
was a "merchant."

42:44.800 --> 42:47.909
John had heard he was
also a chicken farmer.

42:47.933 --> 42:50.442
Both were true, in part.

42:50.466 --> 42:54.009
It seems that Martin was
actually successful in

42:54.033 --> 42:57.509
many realms, and made a
substantial fortune as a

42:57.533 --> 43:00.776
rancher and a businessman.

43:00.800 --> 43:03.842
This made him a
prominent figure in Colombia.

43:03.866 --> 43:06.576
Indeed, we found newspaper
articles dating back to the

43:06.600 --> 43:10.733
1950s detailing his
very colorful career...

43:13.066 --> 43:15.042
LEGUIZAMO: "Don Martin Vargas
Cualla is a character

43:15.066 --> 43:16.776
out of a novel.

43:16.800 --> 43:19.709
A familial or academic setback
threw him into the capital

43:19.733 --> 43:22.509
city when he was
beginning his adolescence.

43:22.533 --> 43:25.176
For ten pesos, he bought two
old horses that he later sold

43:25.200 --> 43:27.776
at 25, and that
was the beginning.

43:27.800 --> 43:30.042
Animals and lands allowed him
to multiply in a world that

43:30.066 --> 43:33.976
was his own, estate after
estate, beasts, and cattle.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.976
The previous owner of those
old horses is a breeder of

43:37.000 --> 43:39.842
beautiful specimens and
a creator of riches."

43:39.866 --> 43:42.776
GATES: Any word of this...

43:42.800 --> 43:43.842
LEGUIZAMO: No, no.

43:43.866 --> 43:44.976
GATES: Never passed
down in your family?

43:45.000 --> 43:45.910
LEGUIZAMO: No. Nobody...

43:45.934 --> 43:47.309
GATES: Why?

43:47.333 --> 43:48.576
LEGUIZAMO: I, I don't,
I don't know what was

43:48.600 --> 43:49.909
going on in my family.

43:49.933 --> 43:54.142
I mean, uh, was it, were, were
the people just not proud or,

43:54.166 --> 43:56.976
or, or, or because they were,
or because he was a natural

43:57.000 --> 43:58.509
instead of a legitimate son?

43:58.533 --> 43:59.876
GATES: Mhm.

43:59.900 --> 44:03.242
LEGUIZAMO: I think, a lot of my
father's own, demons, kind of...

44:03.266 --> 44:04.243
GATES: Yeah.

44:04.267 --> 44:05.376
LEGUIZAMO: Haunting
him his whole life.

44:05.400 --> 44:07.476
'Cause he was always,
my father was always,

44:07.500 --> 44:11.476
never satisfied with what,
what he did, never, always

44:11.500 --> 44:14.609
constantly questing for more,
always trying to be better,

44:14.633 --> 44:15.809
always trying to...

44:15.833 --> 44:17.676
GATES: Hey, I come from
people, I had a fortune,

44:17.700 --> 44:18.809
I want to get it back.

44:18.833 --> 44:19.709
LEGUIZAMO: Yeah. Yeah.

44:19.733 --> 44:20.577
GATES: Somehow disappeared.

44:20.601 --> 44:21.842
LEGUIZAMO: 'Cause
he never got it.

44:21.866 --> 44:23.409
He never got it 'cause he wasn't
legitimate to, to the will.

44:23.433 --> 44:24.842
GATES: Right, you got it.

44:24.866 --> 44:28.533
LEGUIZAMO: Wow.
That's crazy.

44:30.133 --> 44:32.109
GATES: It turns out that
Martin wasn't the only

44:32.133 --> 44:35.609
prominent figure on this
branch of John's tree.

44:35.633 --> 44:39.276
Moving back two generations,
we came to a man named

44:39.300 --> 44:41.566
Higinio Cualla.

44:41.833 --> 44:44.509
Higinio is John's
great-great-grandfather,

44:44.533 --> 44:49.509
and his obituary, published
in Colombia in 1927,

44:49.533 --> 44:53.466
is a litany of impressive
accomplishments.

44:54.266 --> 44:56.842
LEGUIZAMO: "Yesterday passed
away Don Higinio Cualla,

44:56.866 --> 44:58.742
at the age of 87 years.

44:58.766 --> 45:00.876
Bogotá will always
remember with gratitude

45:00.900 --> 45:02.609
the best of our mayors.

45:02.633 --> 45:04.809
His love for the city, his
commitment to the common good,

45:04.833 --> 45:07.576
the enthusiasm with which he
worked on all hours for the

45:07.600 --> 45:10.509
progress of the capital
can never be forgotten.

45:10.533 --> 45:12.242
He was the real initiator
of the development of

45:12.266 --> 45:13.842
modern Bogotá.

45:13.866 --> 45:15.409
Many of the improvements
that we enjoy today

45:15.433 --> 45:16.842
are owed to him.

45:16.866 --> 45:19.376
It is a shame that his grand
spirit did not continue to

45:19.400 --> 45:21.476
inspire his successors."

45:21.500 --> 45:23.109
GATES: Pretty
amazing, isn't it?

45:23.133 --> 45:25.076
LEGUIZAMO: As a
mayor of Bogotá?

45:25.100 --> 45:26.609
GATES: For 16 years.

45:26.633 --> 45:28.176
LEGUIZAMO: Wow.

45:28.200 --> 45:31.009
GATES: From 1884 to 1900.

45:31.033 --> 45:32.209
LEGUIZAMO: That's wild.

45:32.233 --> 45:35.276
I, we, but we never,
nobody ever acknowledged that.

45:35.300 --> 45:38.409
Nobody ever passed that down to
me, telling me that, you know,

45:38.433 --> 45:41.242
I'm the son of, I'm, I'm the
great-grandson of a mayor.

45:41.266 --> 45:44.209
GATES: Yeah!
How do you feel about that?

45:44.233 --> 45:46.876
LEGUIZAMO: I, I, my chest
is pumped up a little bit.

45:46.900 --> 45:50.176
I do feel a little, uh,
boastful, and I'm gonna

45:50.200 --> 45:53.200
have to try to calm myself.

45:55.366 --> 45:58.176
GATES: This obituary claims
that Higinio helped modernize

45:58.200 --> 46:02.776
Bogotá, and the historical
record bears that out.

46:02.800 --> 46:07.142
After taking office in 1884,
the Cualla administration

46:07.166 --> 46:11.442
helped bring electricity to
the city, built trolley lines,

46:11.466 --> 46:16.442
a theater, and an aqueduct,
all the while fixing roads and

46:16.466 --> 46:20.133
establishing a tax to
help the city's poor.

46:22.600 --> 46:23.842
LEGUIZAMO: Wow.

46:23.866 --> 46:25.309
GATES: He truly
was industrious.

46:25.333 --> 46:26.542
LEGUIZAMO: And he
was compassionate:

46:26.566 --> 46:27.742
"Shelter for beggars".

46:27.766 --> 46:29.576
GATES: And on the left,
there's a monument.

46:29.600 --> 46:31.576
LEGUIZAMO: Oh, did they
knock that one down, too?

46:31.600 --> 46:32.976
GATES: It's another
monument, a monument...

46:33.000 --> 46:35.309
Now, the good news,
it's still standing.

46:35.333 --> 46:36.376
LEGUIZAMO: Oh, it is?

46:36.400 --> 46:37.876
Yeah, he, he didn't
do anything dastardly.

46:37.900 --> 46:39.176
GATES: And you've
never seen that before?

46:39.200 --> 46:40.976
LEGUIZAMO: No, I mean
who would've thunk?

46:41.000 --> 46:42.842
GATES: But look at this.

46:42.866 --> 46:46.542
Your 15th great-grandfather
Sebastián was a statue.

46:46.566 --> 46:47.976
LEGUIZAMO: Yeah. Yeah.

46:48.000 --> 46:49.776
GATES: Your great-great-
grandfather, a statue.

46:49.800 --> 46:50.842
That's amazing.

46:50.866 --> 46:51.976
LEGUIZAMO: Yeah. Yeah.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.142
GATES: How do you think
these stories got lost?

46:54.166 --> 46:57.209
I mean you have two sets
of stories that got lost.

46:57.233 --> 46:58.809
LEGUIZAMO: Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, all, all of it.

46:58.833 --> 47:01.576
I mean I, I, I think that's a
lot, uh, really true for a lot

47:01.600 --> 47:03.976
of Latin people, and you know,
uh, the conquest was a brutal

47:04.000 --> 47:07.576
thing where people were, you
know, you were destroying a

47:07.600 --> 47:11.842
culture, you're mixing with
it, you're, they're, they're

47:11.866 --> 47:15.176
sexually attracted, so you're
creating a, a new culture,

47:15.200 --> 47:18.109
but it, but, but at that same
time, things are being hidden.

47:18.133 --> 47:19.409
There's a lot of shaming.

47:19.433 --> 47:21.842
There's a lot of hiding
and, and I don't know.

47:21.866 --> 47:24.076
I think it, that doesn't
totally disappear that easily

47:24.100 --> 47:27.142
over a couple of centuries,
and I think that's part of it.

47:27.166 --> 47:30.176
There's a lot of stuff that's
hidden, and I think there's a

47:30.200 --> 47:32.576
lot of shame in, in, in
the conquest, and, and that

47:32.600 --> 47:35.866
continues and perpetuates,
sort of like a PTSD.

47:38.266 --> 47:41.842
GATES: Turning to DNA, we can
see how this complex history

47:41.866 --> 47:45.309
is reflected in
John's own chromosomes...

47:45.333 --> 47:49.109
His admixture indicates
that he's a blend of

47:49.133 --> 47:51.709
Native American, European and

47:51.733 --> 47:54.409
sub-Saharan African...

47:54.433 --> 47:57.542
And when we looked at his
mitochondrial DNA, the genetic

47:57.566 --> 48:01.242
fingerprint that's passed down
from mother-to-child across

48:01.266 --> 48:05.642
generations, we were able
to pinpoint the geographic

48:05.666 --> 48:09.666
origins of his direct
maternal ancestors.

48:11.933 --> 48:13.409
You want to guess?

48:13.433 --> 48:15.642
Was she European,
was she African,

48:15.666 --> 48:17.009
or was she Indigenous?

48:17.033 --> 48:18.276
LEGUIZAMO: I
would say Indigenous.

48:18.300 --> 48:19.676
GATES: Okay. But why?

48:19.700 --> 48:21.109
LEGUIZAMO: Because the
conquistadors were,

48:21.133 --> 48:22.376
were mostly male.

48:22.400 --> 48:23.642
GATES: Uh-huh.

48:23.666 --> 48:24.909
LEGUIZAMO: And, and, and the
women that they had affairs

48:24.933 --> 48:26.842
with were mostly
Indigenous or African.

48:26.866 --> 48:27.743
Yeah. Yeah.

48:27.767 --> 48:29.642
GATES: Please turn the page.

The map there shows
your where your direct

48:40.133 --> 48:41.976
maternal ancestors came from.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.142
As you can see, they all
came from the Americas.

48:44.166 --> 48:45.876
LEGUIZAMO: Yeah,
Indigenous, yeah, yeah.

48:45.900 --> 48:47.709
GATES: How does
it make you feel?

48:47.733 --> 48:49.442

GATES: While John was
delighted by his DNA results,

49:02.533 --> 49:05.776
they were not a
complete surprise.

49:05.800 --> 49:08.533
But that wasn't the
case with Lena Waithe.

49:09.666 --> 49:12.176
When we examined her
mitochondrial DNA,

49:12.200 --> 49:14.942
believing it would take
us back to Africa,

49:14.966 --> 49:19.133
we found ourselves somewhere
completely unexpected...

I, I, uhm, wow.
I, I wasn't expecting that.

49:42.666 --> 49:44.933
GATES: Neither was I.

49:46.533 --> 49:50.909
Lena's mitochondrial DNA ties
her to a subgroup of what's

49:50.933 --> 49:53.576
known as "haplogroup B",

49:53.600 --> 49:57.142
one of four major
Native American haplogroups.

49:57.166 --> 50:00.509
This means that Lena's direct
maternal ancestors crossed

50:00.533 --> 50:04.866
into North America more
than 15,000 years ago.

50:05.733 --> 50:08.276
Causing Lena to
re-imagine, once again,

50:08.300 --> 50:11.366
her family's story...

51:35.733 --> 51:38.976
thought of myself as, and
my ancestors as American.

51:39.000 --> 51:39.977
GATES: Right.

51:40.001 --> 51:41.276
WAITHE: As... you know...

51:41.300 --> 51:46.042
and thinking of, knowing that
my ancestors are immigrants,

51:46.066 --> 51:50.142
and, and chose to come to
this country, just gives me

51:50.166 --> 51:51.609
a whole new perspective.

51:51.633 --> 51:52.776
GATES: You're from elsewhere.

51:52.800 --> 51:54.376
WAITHE: Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

51:54.400 --> 51:56.442
I'll take it.

51:56.466 --> 51:58.376
GATES: That's the end of our
journey with Lena Waithe and

51:58.400 --> 52:00.509
John Leguizamo.

52:00.533 --> 52:04.576
Join me next time when we
unlock the secrets of the past

52:04.600 --> 52:09.966
for new guests, on another
episode of
<i>Finding Your Roots.</i>
