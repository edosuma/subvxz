WEBVTT

00:12.160 --> 00:13.503
Morning!

00:17.200 --> 00:19.360
DIANA HUMMING

00:48.324 --> 00:49.521
St John.

00:50.160 --> 00:54.125
Ah, wonderful. St John Gurney-Clifford.

00:54.160 --> 00:56.901
- Will. Pleasure to meet you.
- Pleasure's all mine.

00:58.160 --> 00:59.242
Diana!

01:02.052 --> 01:05.597
Ooh. Can't face the world
without my face.

01:09.227 --> 01:10.626
Your bloody mother.

01:10.965 --> 01:12.640
Well, you bloody invited her.

01:16.507 --> 01:18.592
It's sterling work you do.

01:18.628 --> 01:20.628
- Thank you.
- I've nothing but admiration.

01:21.979 --> 01:25.412
Will's helping troubled boys.
Physical training.

01:25.448 --> 01:28.125
- Er, boxing.
- Ah, you see? Sterling work.

01:28.160 --> 01:29.599
Well, it's what they pay me for.

01:30.160 --> 01:33.575
How much is that?
It's not a great deal, I imagine.

01:35.160 --> 01:36.642
Well, respect where it's due.

01:36.678 --> 01:38.874
Must be quite some vocation
when your chairman

01:38.910 --> 01:41.240
is, to all intents and purposes,
invisible.

01:41.276 --> 01:42.476
BOTH LAUGH

01:44.040 --> 01:46.325
Well, there's more to life
than financial reward.

01:47.340 --> 01:49.766
Oh, he's teasing, darling.

01:51.157 --> 01:54.997
Well, I'm very glad you made it,
albeit a little on the late side.

01:56.094 --> 02:00.728
We have... an announcement to make.

02:00.764 --> 02:04.325
Amie! At least let the chap
finish his coffee.

02:04.360 --> 02:05.558
Oh, sorry.

02:08.747 --> 02:10.500
I've asked your mother to marry me.

02:16.755 --> 02:18.497
And I've said yes.

02:18.711 --> 02:20.711
At our age it doesn't do to hang about.

02:23.823 --> 02:25.152
Congratulations.

02:25.571 --> 02:28.259
You will come to the engagement
party, won't you, darling?

02:30.360 --> 02:31.360
CHUCKLES SOFTLY

02:34.200 --> 02:35.360
WILL GRUNTING

02:39.360 --> 02:41.360
Whoever that is,
I fancy you've done for 'em.

02:43.360 --> 02:45.036
My mother's remarrying.

02:48.360 --> 02:50.609
He calls her Amie.
No-one calls her Amie.

02:53.024 --> 02:54.700
Why don't you like him?

02:55.305 --> 02:57.643
He puts her down
and she doesn't even notice.

02:57.679 --> 02:58.644
Ah.

02:59.289 --> 03:01.166
It doesn't matter what I think now,
does it?

03:01.541 --> 03:03.325
No, it's completely out of your control.

03:03.830 --> 03:05.325
Embrace the freedom, Will.

03:06.189 --> 03:07.739
What, and just watch her make a mistake?

03:07.775 --> 03:09.325
Well, it's like I say to the boys.

03:09.360 --> 03:12.360
We're a family.
And family's all about compromise.

03:22.891 --> 03:25.325
St John. What kind of name is St John?

03:26.086 --> 03:28.325
Women of a certain age, no disrespect,

03:28.360 --> 03:31.005
can be rather intransigent.

03:31.040 --> 03:33.325
She's marrying the first man
with a blazer like my father's

03:33.360 --> 03:34.365
and an entry in Debrett's.

03:34.915 --> 03:37.711
I made the mistake of mentioning
the television set to Mrs C.

03:38.008 --> 03:40.165
Why can't she just be on her own
for once?

03:40.200 --> 03:41.940
You should've seen the look on her face.

03:41.976 --> 03:43.781
Like I'd broken the custard jug.

03:43.817 --> 03:45.325
Yeah. Vic says
if you can't change something,

03:45.360 --> 03:47.161
you have to find another way round it.

03:47.360 --> 03:49.325
You mean like going
to your mother's engagement party

03:49.360 --> 03:50.525
with a protest placard?

03:50.560 --> 03:52.160
That's actually quite tempting.

03:59.360 --> 04:00.360
WOMAN SHRIEKING

04:19.180 --> 04:20.440
Dickie Astor.

04:20.680 --> 04:22.685
Owns a finance company in Waterbeach.

04:23.051 --> 04:25.040
Just gonna track down next-of-kin.

04:30.052 --> 04:31.817
It's the hair. And the tie.

04:31.853 --> 04:33.243
Thinks he's in love.

04:33.762 --> 04:35.880
Man whiffs like a tart's armpit.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.360
- You get a look at the driver?
- No.

04:39.508 --> 04:41.708
- Make of car?
- Maybe.

04:43.460 --> 04:45.460
- Number plate?
- Yes.

04:46.556 --> 04:48.260
And it'll come back to me any minute.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.325
These orchids?

04:56.903 --> 04:59.050
Don't see many of those
growing on Jesus Green.

05:01.168 --> 05:04.160
It's a big responsibility,
but someone's gotta step up.

05:04.196 --> 05:05.518
Will you stop flirting?

05:05.554 --> 05:07.559
See what you can find out
about these flowers.

05:07.946 --> 05:09.008
Boss.

05:10.913 --> 05:13.040
Can you confirm
this is a murder inquiry?

05:14.211 --> 05:15.329
Bloody Larry.

05:16.319 --> 05:17.649
For the record.

05:18.868 --> 05:19.988
Geordie?

05:23.848 --> 05:25.560
She's the love interest?

05:28.084 --> 05:29.989
- Why? You jealous?
- No.

05:30.720 --> 05:32.360
- No!
- KNOCKING

05:41.234 --> 05:45.325
Your husband, was he in the habit
of buying you flowers, Mrs Astor?

05:45.360 --> 05:46.807
Jacqueline, please.

05:47.742 --> 05:50.010
Dickie wasn't really
the sentimental type.

05:52.360 --> 05:55.005
We're keeping an open mind as to motive.

05:55.470 --> 05:58.937
Obviously, we're trying to trace
the vehicle that ran Mr Astor down.

05:59.187 --> 06:02.187
A Morris Eight, we believe.

06:03.890 --> 06:06.460
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- You don't have to be sorry.

06:13.260 --> 06:15.360
Dickie and I have been together
since I was 19.

06:16.095 --> 06:17.525
Probably sounds facile to you,

06:17.560 --> 06:19.884
but he really did sweep me off my feet.

06:21.360 --> 06:23.720
It's all rather pitiful
that it should come to this.

06:28.360 --> 06:29.360
INDISTINCT CHATTER

06:32.294 --> 06:34.059
Bailiffs? Well, it looks like

06:34.095 --> 06:37.446
Dickie Astor was high on charisma,
low on readies.

06:42.027 --> 06:46.410
Here's the client list,
but I never sat in on the meetings.

06:46.446 --> 06:51.446
Cos Dickie... Mr Astor.

06:52.360 --> 06:54.325
He done most of them
in the client's own home.

06:54.360 --> 06:56.984
- Mm-hm.
- For the exclusive experience.

06:57.438 --> 06:59.403
And I ain't got shorthand, so...

07:00.061 --> 07:01.468
Or a reference now.

07:02.945 --> 07:04.945
Mother's going to have my guts.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.660
Fancy a cuppa?

07:10.531 --> 07:12.531
Well, only if they've left you
the kettle.

07:13.560 --> 07:14.760
Right-oh.

07:22.721 --> 07:26.325
You do not stay as well preserved
as Mrs Jacqueline Astor

07:26.360 --> 07:28.325
without some serious investment.

07:28.360 --> 07:29.365
Can't say I've noticed.

07:29.400 --> 07:31.816
You do know it's not lying
that makes you go blind.

07:34.460 --> 07:35.460
Bingo.

07:40.716 --> 07:43.360
This is definitely not meant
for the taxman.

07:46.075 --> 07:48.201
It was a nice car that ran Dickie down.

07:48.318 --> 07:49.730
The kind that
might have come from a house

07:49.766 --> 07:51.731
big enough for exclusive visits.

07:52.062 --> 07:54.027
What if someone worked out
what he was up to?

07:54.123 --> 07:56.254
Could've been the client
he stole from that ran him down.

07:57.516 --> 07:59.712
Well, if we knew
the number plate of the car,

07:59.829 --> 08:01.633
we could call round and ask them.

08:08.827 --> 08:10.520
Retracing your steps.

08:11.053 --> 08:13.059
American mumbo-jumbo.

08:14.055 --> 08:16.020
Lot to answer for, those Americans.

08:16.175 --> 08:18.325
Can you finish this conversation
in your head?

08:19.075 --> 08:20.325
Suppose you got used to losing stuff,

08:20.360 --> 08:22.325
living in a stately home.

08:22.360 --> 08:23.661
Mum.

08:24.273 --> 08:27.183
Of course back at ours it's either
the living room or the kitchen.

08:27.219 --> 08:30.024
- Engagement party. St John.
- Or maybe the lav.

08:30.371 --> 08:32.336
If I can crowbar the mother-in-law
out of it.

08:32.403 --> 08:33.679
Placard.

08:36.788 --> 08:38.788
GSK 786.

08:49.297 --> 08:53.582
"I will set no wicked thing
before mine eyes".

08:54.125 --> 08:56.259
Psalms 101.

08:56.829 --> 08:58.434
I thought you hated Psalms.

08:58.828 --> 09:01.028
I hate this monstrosity more.

09:02.360 --> 09:05.583
GSK 786 is registered
here in Grantchester.

09:06.141 --> 09:08.325
Elliot House, Way Lane.

09:08.360 --> 09:11.040
Way Lane. Never heard of it.

09:16.300 --> 09:18.900
- What?
- Police enquiry's ground to a halt.

09:19.314 --> 09:21.325
All for the want
of a little local knowledge.

09:21.360 --> 09:22.685
Ah, well, it's wisdom, really, Geordie.

09:22.947 --> 09:24.552
It's community spirit, Will.

09:25.203 --> 09:28.176
Oh, give me strength!

09:29.908 --> 09:32.325
You'll have me wearing
one of your uniforms next.

09:32.360 --> 09:34.325
- Leonard.
- Nothing!

09:35.162 --> 09:36.638
Watch the potatoes.

09:47.360 --> 09:50.325
Down the end there, through the trees.

09:50.360 --> 09:53.325
- Way Lane.
- You're a Godsend, Mrs C.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.600
I don't know about that.

09:55.171 --> 09:56.864
Some of the stories...

09:57.360 --> 09:58.679
What stories?

09:59.828 --> 10:02.502
Oh, all old wives' tales probably.

10:05.276 --> 10:06.948
Be home before dark.

11:01.957 --> 11:03.400
Hello?

11:08.644 --> 11:10.004
Anyone home?

11:12.031 --> 11:13.450
You're trespassing.

11:14.696 --> 11:18.325
- Er, Police, Mr erm...?
- Graham.

11:18.711 --> 11:20.711
We're looking for the owner
of a Morris Eight.

11:21.777 --> 11:23.101
Get back to your room.

11:25.360 --> 11:27.090
Back to your room, do you hear me?

11:27.997 --> 11:31.122
Damn fool. That is an order!

11:31.360 --> 11:32.731
Sorry. I'm... I'm...

11:33.685 --> 11:36.043
I'm sorry. Sorry.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.133
This belong to you, does it, Sir?

12:03.169 --> 12:05.433
Barely used it in 20 years.

12:05.469 --> 12:08.360
I shall expect your apology
in writing, officer.

12:12.263 --> 12:14.219
How do you account for that, Mr Graham?

12:24.838 --> 12:26.641
Idiots' lantern.

12:27.549 --> 12:29.724
What the Dickens was Will thinking?

12:29.760 --> 12:33.051
Yes, well, it's here now,
so, just, if you... Up a bit.

12:33.470 --> 12:34.768
To the right.

12:41.560 --> 12:44.725
- Oh!
- Perfect.

12:44.760 --> 12:46.525
MUSIC ON TV

12:46.560 --> 12:49.205
Right, well...
I'll see you in the morning.

12:49.240 --> 12:50.560
SINGING IN FRENCH ON TV

12:58.397 --> 13:00.242
Is that what he bought it for?

13:01.208 --> 13:03.853
To watch a lot of little people
singing in foreign?

13:04.548 --> 13:07.525
It's a celebration of the ties
between European nations.

13:07.560 --> 13:08.990
It's convivial.

13:09.400 --> 13:11.525
It's suspicious, is what it is.

13:11.560 --> 13:15.194
Right, well. Don't let me keep you.

13:21.269 --> 13:23.947
How'd you explain
the damage to your car, Mr Graham?

13:25.822 --> 13:27.648
Does anyone else have access to it?

13:27.708 --> 13:30.708
The gentleman you live with.
Your brother, is it?

13:32.270 --> 13:34.889
Mr Graham, did you know Dickie Astor...

13:35.603 --> 13:37.741
of R Astor Investment Brokers?

13:39.560 --> 13:42.525
Is he circling
in the hope of saving my soul?

13:42.950 --> 13:44.950
I suspect you're long past that.

13:47.105 --> 13:48.856
Dickie Astor is a family member.

13:49.137 --> 13:52.365
Distant cousin. Not distant enough.

13:52.400 --> 13:53.977
When did you last see him?

13:59.436 --> 14:01.560
R Astor Brokers.

14:02.153 --> 14:05.680
A Mr Graham of Way Lane...

14:07.419 --> 14:09.011
..made some hefty investments.

14:09.047 --> 14:11.901
Investments? Oh, do keep up!

14:11.937 --> 14:14.525
The man ran Ponzi schemes,
for Christ's sake!

14:14.560 --> 14:16.400
He was a con artist.

14:17.400 --> 14:18.885
No-one but the most gullible

14:18.920 --> 14:20.525
would be drawn into financial dealings

14:20.560 --> 14:22.560
with Mr Dickie Astor.

14:24.960 --> 14:26.925
- Your brother, then.
- Damn fool.

14:26.961 --> 14:29.240
<i>Don't</i> call him that.

14:34.560 --> 14:36.560
I found our savings book too late.

14:37.680 --> 14:39.407
John had already parted with them.

14:40.560 --> 14:43.205
For months
that bastard was working on him.

14:43.240 --> 14:44.525
Bleeding us dry.

14:44.560 --> 14:46.525
And then he had the utter gall

14:46.560 --> 14:48.525
to turn his attention
to the equity in our house.

14:48.560 --> 14:50.525
Well, I put a stop to that.
HE SCOFFS

14:50.822 --> 14:52.721
I threw Dickie Astor out

14:52.757 --> 14:54.588
and gave John
the dressing down of his life.

14:54.624 --> 14:56.753
If you're having bad luck,
shouldn't you ask for help?

14:56.789 --> 14:58.525
Instead of taking it out
on your brother.

14:58.560 --> 14:59.525
Bad luck?

15:00.397 --> 15:03.525
You know nothing,
with your God and your smug life,

15:03.560 --> 15:05.525
comfortably lived.

15:05.560 --> 15:07.525
Luck, chaplain?

15:07.560 --> 15:09.560
Dickie Astor cleaned us out.

15:10.849 --> 15:12.525
We're all well shot of him.

15:12.560 --> 15:14.919
Did you get in the car, Mr Graham?

15:15.943 --> 15:17.903
Did you follow Dickie Astor?

15:18.770 --> 15:21.069
Did you run him over
for stealing your savings?

15:23.021 --> 15:24.225
Mr Graham?

15:31.358 --> 15:32.525
He's a bully.

15:32.560 --> 15:34.525
Just one more controlling man
who preys on the weak.

15:34.560 --> 15:36.525
Thinks everyone should jump
when he tells them to.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.525
Still not completely sold on
St John, then?

15:38.560 --> 15:40.560
- Who's St John?
- BOTH: No comment.

15:43.560 --> 15:44.673
Any luck, Larry?

15:45.290 --> 15:49.228
It's either Paphiopedilum
or Phalaenopsis.

15:49.560 --> 15:50.725
That's easy for you to say.

15:50.760 --> 15:52.525
Neither of 'em grow in England, mind.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.046
So, where did he get them from?

15:54.497 --> 15:55.676
I don't know, boss.

15:56.400 --> 15:57.568
Find out, then.

15:58.122 --> 15:59.315
He's bloody useless.

16:00.560 --> 16:01.690
Pint?

16:02.154 --> 16:04.794
Er, I might go and check on the brother.

16:06.560 --> 16:09.525
Oh, well. Suppose there's
no avoiding the mother-in-law.

16:10.375 --> 16:11.817
I know when she's around.

16:11.853 --> 16:13.525
The mice throw themselves on the traps.

16:13.560 --> 16:15.045
That is terrible.

16:15.080 --> 16:16.560
Got to get my pleasure from somewhere.

16:20.081 --> 16:21.365
Pie's in the oven.

16:21.400 --> 16:22.525
Pie. Oven.

16:22.560 --> 16:24.525
There's a tin of fruit salad for afters.

16:24.560 --> 16:26.200
Fruit salad. Marvellous.

16:27.560 --> 16:29.525
Don't forget, dishcloths need soaking.

16:29.560 --> 16:31.560
I wouldn't dare. Night.

16:38.560 --> 16:39.893
Psst!

16:41.560 --> 16:42.525
Finally.

16:42.560 --> 16:44.560
That was interminable.

16:55.333 --> 16:56.772
You're home.

16:57.080 --> 16:59.560
Ah there's only so long
I could put it off.

17:01.898 --> 17:04.560
Cathy says spam fritters
are a favourite.

17:09.400 --> 17:10.525
I could get used to this.

17:10.560 --> 17:12.064
I'm pleased to hear it.

17:12.400 --> 17:14.525
Because you are looking at

17:14.560 --> 17:18.525
Swinnerton's newest shop steward
for ladies' wear.

17:18.560 --> 17:20.525
Mum. That's amazing!

17:20.560 --> 17:23.525
I know! All them union
meetings came good.

17:23.560 --> 17:26.130
- Shop steward?
- Yeah. Vote was this morning.

17:26.165 --> 17:29.040
Let me get my shoes off
and I'll show you my badge.

17:31.226 --> 17:32.808
Shop steward?

17:33.661 --> 17:35.980
It's just another word for communist.

17:37.560 --> 17:39.560
CHATTER IN FRENCH ON TV

17:42.560 --> 17:45.560
It's France. It's France.

17:46.066 --> 17:48.031
How many countries are there in Europe?

17:48.560 --> 17:50.525
Now, I was going to get snails,

17:50.560 --> 17:53.360
but the only ones I could find
were in the garden, so...

18:03.152 --> 18:05.560
It's called a macaron.

18:07.460 --> 18:09.360
Must have cost a fortune.

18:22.230 --> 18:25.560
Oh. It's a bit dry.

18:27.345 --> 18:29.013
Do you think it's meant to be that dry?

18:29.049 --> 18:30.814
I think it's perfect.

18:31.353 --> 18:32.695
It's definitely a bit dry.

18:32.731 --> 18:34.061
Just a touch.

18:50.113 --> 18:52.078
Should've come in
the other end of the lane.

18:52.114 --> 18:53.952
You don't have to crawl through a hedge.

18:55.560 --> 18:58.045
- Ordnance survey.
- Are you following me?

18:58.527 --> 19:02.367
I got here first, so no.
Not technically.

19:03.813 --> 19:05.617
You know I'm coming with you, don't you?

19:09.259 --> 19:12.075
I've tried the door. He's not answering.

19:12.252 --> 19:14.052
KNOCKING

19:17.018 --> 19:19.045
Is it true
Harry Graham's in court tomorrow?

19:19.080 --> 19:20.525
He hasn't been charged with anything.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.525
So, you are questioning him.

19:22.560 --> 19:24.205
Why don't you ask Larry?

19:24.240 --> 19:25.525
Am I sensing resentment?

19:25.560 --> 19:27.781
No. No!

19:28.466 --> 19:30.525
You know the Brylcreem and cologne,
that's for you, right?

19:30.560 --> 19:32.139
- I guessed as much.
- HE SCOFFS

19:32.175 --> 19:33.725
Well, if it gives me an advantage.

19:33.760 --> 19:35.560
You have no principles.

19:43.560 --> 19:45.162
I have principles.

19:45.944 --> 19:48.075
EXHALES Yeah, until the rent's due.

19:50.560 --> 19:53.525
Says the man breaking and entering
through a garden gate.

19:53.560 --> 19:54.648
It's locked.

19:55.234 --> 19:58.234
- We could climb over.
- No. Absolutely not.

20:09.560 --> 20:10.560
WILL STRAINING

20:16.791 --> 20:18.525
Do they not teach climbing
at posh school?

20:18.560 --> 20:20.560
My parents wouldn't pay the extra.

20:34.560 --> 20:35.560
Wow.

20:40.303 --> 20:42.381
This place has got so much love in it.

20:45.920 --> 20:47.116
What?

20:47.915 --> 20:50.600
That is the least cynical thing
I have ever heard you say.

20:54.065 --> 20:56.760
Is that the widow?
What's she doing here?

21:01.217 --> 21:03.560
You go in mob-handed,
you'll scare him off.

21:05.114 --> 21:08.079
Mr Graham. I'm sorry to intrude.

21:08.115 --> 21:09.193
We were worried about you.

21:11.301 --> 21:12.546
Where's Harry?

21:13.080 --> 21:15.560
He's going to be spending the night
at the police station.

21:18.229 --> 21:21.084
I don't wanna speak out of turn,
but if your brother is...

21:21.920 --> 21:25.045
If Harry is treating you poorly,
I can help.

21:25.542 --> 21:28.560
HE WINCES

21:29.610 --> 21:32.405
Oh, Mr Graham. Are those begonias?

21:36.275 --> 21:37.600
I love begonias.

21:38.600 --> 21:40.187
And those erm...

21:40.270 --> 21:42.235
The little red flowers
with the white bits?

21:42.271 --> 21:45.024
- Antirrhinum.
- Yeah. That's it. I love those.

21:45.177 --> 21:49.215
- And the statues.
- They're... They're my pals.

22:01.185 --> 22:03.725
Oh. Oh, thank you.

22:04.906 --> 22:08.028
Dickie was here, wasn't he?
Before he died.

22:08.688 --> 22:10.525
Is that why Jacqueline came to see you?

22:11.308 --> 22:12.783
What happened, John?

22:15.170 --> 22:17.075
- Stay back.
- John.

22:19.560 --> 22:20.888
Stay back!

22:29.114 --> 22:30.239
Thank you.

22:30.275 --> 22:33.240
Erm, not so much for the music.

22:33.276 --> 22:35.276
Or the macaron.

22:36.651 --> 22:38.275
I don't want you to go.

22:40.320 --> 22:41.525
You gave your word.

22:41.560 --> 22:45.560
I saw a man take his last breaths today.

22:46.560 --> 22:50.232
I doubt he spent his final moments
worrying what others thought of him.

22:51.247 --> 22:53.212
What Mrs C doesn't know won't hurt her.

22:53.905 --> 22:58.560
And frankly... it isn't really
any of her damn business.

23:02.560 --> 23:05.777
- Stay.
- Look, Leonard, I really...

23:18.560 --> 23:19.560
SIGHS

23:23.760 --> 23:25.560
ALARM RINGING

23:33.801 --> 23:34.801
TURNS OFF ALARM

23:39.294 --> 23:41.294
- Morning.
- Morning.

23:50.205 --> 23:52.205
LEONARD GASPS

23:53.608 --> 23:54.924
Someone's hungry.

23:55.289 --> 23:57.524
Yes. Well...

23:57.960 --> 23:59.960
Daniel's here, actually.

24:01.727 --> 24:02.925
He is here.

24:03.590 --> 24:04.925
I see.

24:04.960 --> 24:06.415
- And I am here.
- OK.

24:06.451 --> 24:07.925
And I am perfectly at ease

24:07.960 --> 24:11.960
with the decisions
that have led to this moment.

24:14.960 --> 24:17.516
Who put roses in my custard jug?

24:19.843 --> 24:21.031
She's early.

24:22.320 --> 24:23.925
- Say they're yours.
- What?

24:23.960 --> 24:25.168
Say they're yours!

24:26.960 --> 24:28.709
Er, they're mine!

24:29.451 --> 24:30.489
They're mine.

24:30.585 --> 24:33.550
- What are?
- The roses in the custard jug.

24:33.709 --> 24:36.674
Won't you think of the custard, Will?

24:36.960 --> 24:38.604
And put some clothes on.

24:38.640 --> 24:40.248
Wandering round in your all-together.

24:40.284 --> 24:43.249
I er... I just... I need you to erm...

24:43.960 --> 24:47.228
- What?
- It's the television.

24:48.752 --> 24:50.557
I know it's the television.

24:51.228 --> 24:52.388
Can you hear that?

24:53.653 --> 24:54.653
What?

24:59.960 --> 25:02.605
- Hmm.
- It's probably all those Europeans.

25:02.640 --> 25:04.925
HE EXHALES

25:04.960 --> 25:06.925
Is that bits of pasta on the table?

25:06.960 --> 25:08.925
Who's brought pasta into the vicarage?

25:08.960 --> 25:10.551
Morning, Mrs C.

25:12.186 --> 25:15.925
Up, dressed,
not desecrating my tableware.

25:15.960 --> 25:18.123
At least I can rely on one of you.

25:41.629 --> 25:44.969
Ah, I hope you don't mind.
I wanted to ask something of you.

25:45.005 --> 25:46.005
Of course.

25:49.975 --> 25:51.925
Would you mind telling the police,

25:51.960 --> 25:53.960
I don't believe Harry Graham
could have done this.

25:54.656 --> 25:56.205
They're harmless.

25:57.960 --> 25:59.686
I saw you in the garden with John.

25:59.960 --> 26:02.545
- Spying now?
- Unintentionally.

26:03.594 --> 26:05.114
It's beautiful, isn't it?

26:06.480 --> 26:08.320
It's one place I can hear myself think.

26:09.477 --> 26:10.889
Why were you there?

26:11.181 --> 26:12.925
I feel sorry for them.

26:12.960 --> 26:15.160
Dickie treated those poor old men
despicably.

26:17.108 --> 26:19.108
Did he treat you despicably too?

26:24.252 --> 26:26.518
Did you love your husband, Jacqueline?

26:26.960 --> 26:29.776
If anyone else asked that,
I'd be insulted.

26:31.329 --> 26:32.689
Not at the end, no.

26:34.327 --> 26:36.925
I was naive enough
to think we married for love.

26:36.960 --> 26:39.837
It was all flowers and romance at first.

26:40.777 --> 26:42.742
Once he'd drained my inheritance...

26:43.139 --> 26:45.179
Marriage can be the loneliest of unions.

26:46.842 --> 26:49.842
My parents, it wasn't exactly idyllic.

26:50.896 --> 26:52.861
Put up with all sorts in a marriage.

26:53.330 --> 26:55.125
Convince yourself
if you just try harder,

26:55.160 --> 26:56.815
make a little bit more effort.

26:58.480 --> 27:01.445
The truth is it doesn't matter
how much cold cream you use,

27:01.480 --> 27:03.213
age always takes its toll.

27:03.640 --> 27:05.925
Which is rather unfortunate

27:05.960 --> 27:08.160
when your only real value
is in how you look.

27:11.196 --> 27:12.925
Done? Done?

27:12.960 --> 27:15.925
Oh, blast.
Esme needs her PE kit ironing.

27:15.960 --> 27:17.925
Full-time job being a mum.

27:17.960 --> 27:19.605
Is that meant to be subtle?

27:19.640 --> 27:22.925
- You don't need to take that tone.
- I'm not taking a tone.

27:22.960 --> 27:25.605
You're a bobby's wife. You're a mother.

27:25.640 --> 27:28.925
So? Am I not allowed to have
any kind of life outside?

27:28.960 --> 27:31.925
Someone has to say this.
Geordie clearly won't.

27:31.960 --> 27:34.925
Your little job, it is pin money, Cathy.

27:34.960 --> 27:36.925
It's about more than the money.

27:37.408 --> 27:40.408
You never listen to me.
You've always been a let-down.

27:42.585 --> 27:44.064
Have a good day.

27:45.199 --> 27:46.624
Ham and mustard.

27:49.819 --> 27:51.784
I don't care what you say,
we're keeping her.

27:52.399 --> 27:54.039
- DIANA LAUGHS
- Bye, kids.

28:04.551 --> 28:05.925
John grows them.

28:06.438 --> 28:08.765
Well, that places Dickie Astor
at the house.

28:09.050 --> 28:11.333
Trying to con the brothers
out of their savings.

28:13.616 --> 28:15.341
Well, come on. Spit it out.

28:16.602 --> 28:20.247
John gets angry. He lashes out.

28:20.283 --> 28:23.834
The poor bullied brother?
More damaged than he seems, eh?

28:24.370 --> 28:25.925
Maybe I got it wrong.

28:25.960 --> 28:27.387
Wouldn't be the first time,
let's face it.

28:27.423 --> 28:28.925
John's the one Dickie conned.

28:28.960 --> 28:30.445
John's the one with the temper.

28:30.480 --> 28:32.568
John's Dickie's latest victim.

28:42.480 --> 28:43.960
This isn't right.

28:44.960 --> 28:47.835
You have no right
to keep me here any longer.

28:49.960 --> 28:51.381
You must be parched.

28:59.308 --> 29:03.480
It's shell shock, isn't it?
John's suffering from.

29:08.052 --> 29:11.960
Shut down. Scared of his own shadow.

29:17.599 --> 29:19.164
I've seen it before.

29:21.223 --> 29:22.459
Burma.

29:26.405 --> 29:27.846
John was at Passchendaele.

29:28.784 --> 29:31.285
Saw his pals blown to smithereens.

29:31.906 --> 29:34.722
Well, it's hard to live with someone
when they're suffering like that.

29:36.703 --> 29:39.092
When he came home, they wanted
to put him in the asylum.

29:41.811 --> 29:42.865
Christ.

29:44.960 --> 29:47.288
John's fiancee took one look,
hightailed it.

29:48.464 --> 29:50.464
I didn't entirely blame her.

29:51.861 --> 29:55.445
- John was...
- ..broken.

29:56.725 --> 29:58.523
He wasn't my brother any more.

29:59.725 --> 30:01.397
But you got him back on his feet.

30:02.422 --> 30:04.552
I just steer the ship best I can.

30:04.960 --> 30:06.564
It's the least you do, isn't it?

30:09.900 --> 30:11.462
What else would you do, Harry?

30:13.960 --> 30:15.606
Would you lie for your brother?

30:18.585 --> 30:20.737
You weren't driving that car, were ya?

30:25.960 --> 30:27.925
I haven't seen him
drive the thing in years.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.505
You think it's him.

30:31.480 --> 30:32.925
I didn't see him drive it that day.

30:32.960 --> 30:34.707
But if it wasn't you...

30:40.399 --> 30:41.680
You lock him up...

30:43.590 --> 30:45.242
..John's as good as dead.

30:56.960 --> 30:59.000
Noooooooo!

31:01.000 --> 31:03.160
GRUNTING

31:07.960 --> 31:09.960
GRUNTING CONTINUES

31:11.488 --> 31:13.026
Noooo!

31:15.960 --> 31:16.960
John?

31:17.960 --> 31:19.218
John.

31:22.800 --> 31:24.925
Now, you put the axe down, Mr Graham.

31:25.290 --> 31:26.649
Put it down, John.

31:27.960 --> 31:29.075
Johnny.

31:31.324 --> 31:32.640
You left me.

31:33.640 --> 31:34.960
Well, I'm here now.

31:35.724 --> 31:37.689
- I was frightened.
- I know.

31:38.516 --> 31:39.925
But I'm here now.

31:39.960 --> 31:42.160
I should've gone with my pals.

31:43.630 --> 31:46.630
And where would I be, eh?

31:48.767 --> 31:50.784
Where would I be without you?

31:51.682 --> 31:53.406
I love you, don't I?

31:54.234 --> 31:55.518
Damn fool.

31:57.422 --> 31:59.160
BROTHERS SIGHING

32:00.760 --> 32:01.860
Harry.

32:06.320 --> 32:08.960
Johnny, you need to go
with these gentlemen.

32:09.960 --> 32:11.960
They're good chaps, I promise you.

32:13.960 --> 32:17.523
- Are they pals?
- Very much so.

32:18.702 --> 32:21.702
When you come back, I'll have
this place ship-shape again, hmm?

32:22.405 --> 32:23.511
Don't you worry.

32:24.162 --> 32:26.450
That's it. Take my hand.

32:48.816 --> 32:51.505
We just need to ask you a few questions.

32:51.541 --> 32:52.757
Is that all right?

32:53.602 --> 32:55.084
Then can I see Harry?

32:57.062 --> 33:00.825
John. Did Dickie Astor
come to your house?

33:01.833 --> 33:03.264
The bastard.

33:04.233 --> 33:05.860
We're not gonna disagree with that.

33:07.196 --> 33:08.813
He wanted your home.

33:10.860 --> 33:12.218
Your garden.

33:14.003 --> 33:15.572
Did that make you angry, John?

33:16.454 --> 33:18.059
He didn't deserve them.

33:18.328 --> 33:19.328
Didn't deserve what?

33:21.266 --> 33:22.605
Phalaenopsis.

33:23.860 --> 33:26.825
The orchids. Did he pick them?

33:26.860 --> 33:27.860
Bastard.

33:29.860 --> 33:31.825
Did you get in your car, John?

33:32.652 --> 33:35.700
Palumbina. Paphinia.

33:37.018 --> 33:38.381
Paphiopedilum.

33:38.417 --> 33:39.825
Did you follow him to Grantchester?

33:39.860 --> 33:42.126
Papilionanthe. Papperitzia...

33:42.162 --> 33:43.825
- Did you run him down?
- Paraphalaenopsis.

33:43.860 --> 33:45.860
Peristeria.
BREATHING HEAVILY

33:55.860 --> 33:58.220
Did you run the bastard down, John?

34:06.106 --> 34:08.118
I ran the bastard down.

34:13.333 --> 34:15.302
Can I see Harry now?

34:24.148 --> 34:25.824
I hate this job sometimes.

34:26.607 --> 34:27.824
Do you believe him?

34:28.449 --> 34:30.824
War can do terrible things to a man.

34:30.860 --> 34:33.418
And this is where you start decrying
the younger generation.

34:33.922 --> 34:35.505
"No idea how easy you've had it."

34:35.540 --> 34:36.661
You don't.

34:39.860 --> 34:41.228
Will you knock, Larry?

34:41.264 --> 34:42.824
Phalaenopsis Aphrodite.

34:42.860 --> 34:44.824
Aphrodite was the goddess of love.

34:45.147 --> 34:47.183
Love. Murder.

34:47.570 --> 34:49.063
This is a crime of passion.

34:49.100 --> 34:51.344
You can chuck them, Larry.
We've got our fella.

34:51.581 --> 34:53.025
Oh. Right.

34:53.556 --> 34:54.969
No, no, no. Wait, wait.

34:55.612 --> 34:56.893
Who were they for?

34:58.380 --> 34:59.599
The wife.

34:59.860 --> 35:02.613
No, no, she said
he wasn't the sentimental type.

35:02.860 --> 35:04.825
It was all flowers and romance at first,

35:04.860 --> 35:06.074
but not the end.

35:06.860 --> 35:08.069
So, who were they for?

35:13.146 --> 35:15.860
- Well done, Larry.
- Cheers.

35:21.860 --> 35:23.145
Rosalind?

35:25.472 --> 35:27.825
He was 45 years old.

35:27.860 --> 35:29.825
Why wasn't Dickie Astor
putting on his slippers

35:29.860 --> 35:31.380
and putting up with it
like the rest of us?

35:32.860 --> 35:35.825
Rosalind. We just wanted
to ask you a few questions.

35:36.519 --> 35:38.044
Why do they always run?

35:41.860 --> 35:44.825
Hey. Rosalind.

35:44.860 --> 35:46.825
Rosalind. Rosalind.

35:46.860 --> 35:48.825
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.

35:48.860 --> 35:50.421
Stop. Stop. Stop.

35:55.649 --> 35:58.525
Only one thing makes a person
look more guilty than running away.

35:58.561 --> 36:00.307
That's running away with bags.

36:00.816 --> 36:02.290
Open them up, please.

36:03.722 --> 36:04.788
Open.

36:17.578 --> 36:19.860
You were having an affair
with Dickie Astor.

36:21.003 --> 36:23.232
You were siphoning off his cash,
weren't you?

36:24.860 --> 36:26.860
- What?
- I think he found out.

36:28.216 --> 36:29.665
I think he jilted you.

36:29.952 --> 36:31.482
Threatened to expose you.

36:32.183 --> 36:34.985
You ran him over.
Didn't you, Miss Reece?

36:36.980 --> 36:38.570
I can't drive.

36:39.860 --> 36:41.825
He got them fancy flowers for me.

36:42.063 --> 36:43.825
I never run Dickie over.

36:44.699 --> 36:47.380
You can't say I run Dickie over!

36:48.580 --> 36:52.063
I loved him. Dickie loved me.

36:52.641 --> 36:54.695
- Is that what he told you?
- Yes!

36:58.305 --> 36:59.391
Sorry.

37:03.189 --> 37:05.460
I'm sure he made all sorts of promises.

37:10.059 --> 37:11.593
We were going to leave.

37:11.629 --> 37:13.000
Move to London.

37:13.860 --> 37:15.860
He was going to tell his wife.

37:17.860 --> 37:20.825
He saved that money for him and me.

37:21.483 --> 37:23.447
He knew life with Mother was rotten.

37:25.220 --> 37:27.385
We was gonna get out of this dead end.

37:27.860 --> 37:30.417
Dickie Astor didn't save the money,
Miss Reece.

37:31.860 --> 37:33.069
He stole it.

37:37.860 --> 37:39.825
Middle-aged men are so predictable.

37:39.860 --> 37:40.825
Oh, we're embarrassing.

37:41.151 --> 37:44.825
I mean, naive, dowdy teenager
or mature, confident woman.

37:44.860 --> 37:47.185
- Which one are you gonna choose?
- Well, neither one, obviously.

37:47.220 --> 37:48.825
Cue hilarious reference to celibacy.

37:48.860 --> 37:50.860
On account of the halo and the celibacy.

37:52.540 --> 37:56.700
What happens when you start taking
the love of your life for granted?

37:59.805 --> 38:02.027
All hell breaks loose, believe me.

38:02.063 --> 38:05.825
What happens when they find out
you're leaving them for someone else?

38:05.860 --> 38:09.160
Someone younger. Someone else
he can take advantage of.

38:10.305 --> 38:11.591
Where do we find her?

38:24.158 --> 38:26.443
Rosalind was your final straw,
wasn't she?

38:27.498 --> 38:30.220
Charisma and some shared memories
can only get you so far.

38:31.672 --> 38:33.032
You were leaving Dickie.

38:34.960 --> 38:36.490
I'd packed my bags.

38:37.731 --> 38:39.825
Convinced myself
I'd be back in two weeks,

38:39.860 --> 38:40.825
tail between my legs.

38:41.091 --> 38:42.825
And that was the choice you made.

38:43.470 --> 38:45.176
I'm a middle-aged woman.

38:45.980 --> 38:47.860
My choices are limited.

38:49.275 --> 38:50.904
No job since I married.

38:51.461 --> 38:53.825
No real qualifications.

38:54.709 --> 38:56.377
I'm very nearly invisible.

39:01.671 --> 39:03.937
You borrowed the car,
intending to leave.

39:05.508 --> 39:07.028
John helped you.

39:09.183 --> 39:10.910
You saw Dickie on the high street.

39:14.380 --> 39:16.860
I couldn't lift my foot off the pedal.

39:22.952 --> 39:24.627
I don't have to be sorry.

39:27.544 --> 39:28.869
But I am.

39:31.391 --> 39:32.622
Not for what I did...

39:35.860 --> 39:37.611
..but for what we became.

39:41.475 --> 39:44.512
Jacqueline Astor, I am arresting you
for the murder of Dickie Astor.

39:45.990 --> 39:47.825
You do not have to say anything.

39:47.860 --> 39:50.326
Will you tell the brothers I'm sorry?

40:03.860 --> 40:07.505
So, how's St John
Wotsit-blah-di-blah-di-blah?

40:07.540 --> 40:09.700
Still here, unfortunately.

40:10.930 --> 40:14.668
You might've got him wrong.
He might be a sensitive soul.

40:15.220 --> 40:16.825
Oh, I doubt it.

40:17.548 --> 40:19.185
If I can get on
with the mother-in-law...

40:19.220 --> 40:20.825
No. Really?

40:20.860 --> 40:22.825
She made me spam fritters, Will.

40:22.860 --> 40:24.560
You are so easily pleased.

40:26.606 --> 40:29.150
- Ellie!
- No, no. Don't go.

40:29.900 --> 40:31.825
Don't! What are you...

40:32.050 --> 40:33.614
Behave yourselves.

40:36.860 --> 40:37.825
You look smug.

40:37.860 --> 40:40.187
I don't look smug. I look contrite.

40:40.620 --> 40:42.192
That's your contrite face?

40:42.860 --> 40:44.825
Well, I was trying to apologise,
but fine.

40:44.860 --> 40:47.183
Oh. Apologise for what?

40:48.500 --> 40:49.825
SIGHS

40:49.860 --> 40:52.825
Look, I know you think
I'm cynical and rude...

40:52.860 --> 40:54.476
And unprincipled.

40:55.860 --> 40:57.860
I liked that old chap and his garden.

40:58.554 --> 40:59.825
I hope we didn't scare him.

41:00.445 --> 41:02.024
I'm sure he's fine.

41:03.954 --> 41:05.881
I'm only the way I am cos...

41:06.860 --> 41:08.180
I don't know.
SHE EXHALES

41:08.216 --> 41:11.453
I have to fight twice as hard
as everyone else.

41:11.860 --> 41:13.206
I'm a woman.

41:13.242 --> 41:15.839
If you can't change something,
you have to find another way around it.

41:17.336 --> 41:18.631
Exactly.

41:20.860 --> 41:22.825
You really have to work
on your contrite face.

41:22.860 --> 41:25.825
- Is it that bad?
- Terrible.

41:25.861 --> 41:27.610
OK. What about...

41:29.020 --> 41:31.020
No. No, that is just odd.

41:37.860 --> 41:40.860
I know. I'm late. I'm sorry.

41:42.420 --> 41:44.060
The meeting ran over.

41:44.900 --> 41:47.025
SHE SIGHS

41:47.255 --> 41:49.220
My mum's right, ain't she?

41:52.712 --> 41:54.824
I'll hand my shop steward badge back
tomorrow.

41:54.860 --> 41:57.860
No. Eh, don't do that.

41:59.160 --> 42:02.639
As long as she's staying around,
we might as well put her to use.

42:04.654 --> 42:06.825
Besides, Diana brings me my slippers.

42:07.084 --> 42:08.825
You don't bring me my slippers.

42:09.384 --> 42:11.825
Even when you were home full-time,
I never got slippers.

42:11.860 --> 42:14.060
You can get your own damn slippers.

42:15.493 --> 42:17.360
Do the job you love, Cath.

42:19.524 --> 42:20.860
I'm proud of you.

42:23.022 --> 42:24.860
Even if you are a communist.

42:28.451 --> 42:30.025
Ooh, what's this?

42:30.431 --> 42:34.608
They're dead man's flowers.
Road traffic accident.

42:34.860 --> 42:36.825
Oh. Sweet.

42:36.860 --> 42:38.060
Yeah. Don't say I don't appreciate you.

42:42.179 --> 42:44.439
Well, isn't this a lovely surprise?

42:44.475 --> 42:46.825
Yes, shame you've had a wasted journey.

42:46.860 --> 42:48.505
We have tickets for the opera.

42:48.540 --> 42:49.825
Perhaps if you'd telephoned ahead.

42:49.860 --> 42:51.417
I came to see Mum.

42:53.860 --> 42:56.366
Sorry. You go on. I'll catch you up.

42:57.860 --> 42:59.175
Five minutes.

43:01.679 --> 43:03.755
The meter's running, Amie.

43:08.366 --> 43:11.247
Darling, is everything all right?

43:11.650 --> 43:13.211
HE EXHALES

43:14.540 --> 43:16.825
I know your choices are limited.

43:17.346 --> 43:19.298
But this man is er...

43:20.738 --> 43:22.703
You don't have to compromise.

43:23.250 --> 43:25.609
He puts you down just like Dad.

43:26.860 --> 43:28.175
He belittles you.

43:28.211 --> 43:29.695
I knew you'd do this.

43:29.751 --> 43:30.770
Do what?

43:30.860 --> 43:33.825
Drag St John into some immature grudge

43:33.860 --> 43:35.087
you hold against your father.

43:35.123 --> 43:36.259
That is not what I'm doing.

43:36.295 --> 43:39.825
You said you wanted me to try, William.

43:39.860 --> 43:41.167
You wanted me to be happy.

43:41.203 --> 43:43.168
Well, now I am.
You don't like that either.

43:43.204 --> 43:45.587
Are you sure it's every
other man who puts me down?

43:46.126 --> 43:49.505
He is a bully, Mum.
And you deserve better.

43:49.541 --> 43:51.107
If you don't approve
of our engagement...

43:51.143 --> 43:52.825
I don't. I don't approve.

43:52.860 --> 43:54.967
Then I don't expect to see you
at the party.

43:57.540 --> 43:58.705
Fine.

44:07.860 --> 44:10.825
Family is one of life's
greatest blessings.

44:11.262 --> 44:13.025
Our path through life
would be pretty lonely

44:13.060 --> 44:14.860
without anyone to share it with.

44:15.771 --> 44:17.936
Family is about compromise.

44:18.452 --> 44:20.474
And service and duty.

44:21.860 --> 44:23.900
INDISTINCT

44:26.060 --> 44:28.563
It is about finding another way round.

44:41.860 --> 44:44.590
But family is also about drawing a line.

44:47.191 --> 44:49.345
Saying this far and no further.

44:49.910 --> 44:51.364
Enough is enough.

44:52.860 --> 44:56.825
Matthew says,
"If your brother sins against you,

44:57.222 --> 44:59.825
"tell him his fault,
between you and him alone.

45:00.076 --> 45:03.825
"If he listens,
you have gained your brother."

45:04.477 --> 45:07.505
And if he or she doesn't listen?

45:08.171 --> 45:09.825
Well, then take heart.

45:09.963 --> 45:11.825
For we are all His children.

45:12.872 --> 45:14.825
There is only one family.

45:15.236 --> 45:17.825
And that is the family of our Lord God.

45:17.917 --> 45:19.825
And we all belong.

45:19.860 --> 45:21.860
INDISTINCT
