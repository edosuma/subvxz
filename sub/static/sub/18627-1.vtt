01:32.635 --> 01:33.552
Hot and hazy weather,

01:33.761 --> 01:35.471
with temperatures
reaching into the 90s,

01:35.638 --> 01:37.556
is expected to continue
throughout the weekend

01:37.723 --> 01:39.600
over most of the Southland.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.936
WORZ news time, 12:00.

01:42.103 --> 01:43.646
Good evening, I'm Don Herbert.

01:43.813 --> 01:45.439
Tonight's lead story
is the daring

01:45.606 --> 01:48.609
and deadly paramilitary robbery
at Camp Pendleton.

01:48.776 --> 01:50.111
It left three marines dead and

01:50.319 --> 01:52.029
at least nine others
critically wounded.

01:52.196 --> 01:54.407
Earlier this evening,
a heavily armed commando unit

01:54.573 --> 01:56.053
held up the payroll
office at the base

01:56.200 --> 01:58.786
and fled with $3.5 million.

01:58.953 --> 02:01.330
The robbers exchanged gunfire
with military police

02:01.497 --> 02:03.416
as they raced
to a nearby airfield

02:03.582 --> 02:05.918
and then escaped
in a twin-engine cargo plane.

02:06.085 --> 02:09.170
The pilot and his teenage daughter
are believed to be held hostage

02:09.338 --> 02:10.881
on board the Baja Air...

02:11.048 --> 02:12.466
Turn that bloody radio off.

02:12.633 --> 02:13.634
...was hijacked...

02:20.599 --> 02:22.601
It's okay, Daxie. It's okay.

02:23.102 --> 02:24.812
Here, keep it under radar.

02:26.063 --> 02:27.273
You heard the man.

02:28.107 --> 02:31.235
An intensive manhunt is
underway as marine helicopter units

02:31.402 --> 02:34.613
track down the stolen craft
which was reported heading south,

02:34.780 --> 02:36.699
presumably towards the border.

03:33.172 --> 03:34.590
All right, I'll take care of it.

03:53.484 --> 03:54.944
Hey, Roxanne.

04:12.461 --> 04:13.879
- Where's the fire?
- Back here.

04:14.046 --> 04:16.589
- Hey, somebody...
- Bert's taking the money!

04:21.303 --> 04:23.639
Stop shooting, Curry.
He tossed a grenade.

04:23.806 --> 04:26.058
Fuck, it's somewhere in here.
I'll kill him.

04:26.225 --> 04:26.976
Where is it?

04:27.184 --> 04:29.228
Pull up!
Pull up, we're too low!

04:29.395 --> 04:30.688
Hold on.

04:34.900 --> 04:37.027
The grenade.
Watch out, it's rolling back.

04:37.194 --> 04:38.779
Jack!

04:38.946 --> 04:40.406
Jack!

04:40.573 --> 04:42.074
Throw it out!

04:48.622 --> 04:50.583
- The money?
- The money is gone.

04:50.749 --> 04:52.751
Get ready to jump,
we're going after him.

04:52.918 --> 04:55.421
- Where's the money?
- It's gone!

04:55.588 --> 04:56.755
What happened to Bert?

04:56.922 --> 04:58.882
He bailed with the money,
dumb ass.

04:59.049 --> 05:00.801
I saw a house back there
where he jumped.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.803
- We'll be back, Bert.
- Yeah.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.972
We'll be back, Bert.

05:20.029 --> 05:22.698
The plane? Where's the...

05:22.865 --> 05:26.201
Wait, my grenade exploded.
I heard it.

06:11.121 --> 06:14.249
All right, all right,
get it together.

06:15.084 --> 06:18.253
The money.
I was right behind it.

06:19.672 --> 06:21.924
Then it dropped
by these crosses...

06:22.675 --> 06:24.051
like a graveyard.

06:55.958 --> 06:58.335
Jesus, a scarecrow.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.879
Bloody scarecrow.

07:08.804 --> 07:12.099
I'll be damned, the graveyard.

07:13.016 --> 07:15.144
The money's got to be there.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.105
All right, the house.

07:19.022 --> 07:22.443
There's gotta be a car or a jeep
or something there I can use.

07:23.235 --> 07:24.403
Bloody hell...

07:24.611 --> 07:26.113
Bingo.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.115
My lucky night.

07:36.665 --> 07:39.793
Bingo, my lucky night.

07:41.253 --> 07:42.379
What the hell
is down there, Corbin?

07:42.546 --> 07:43.714
Trees and bushes.

07:43.881 --> 07:46.383
Great, let's find
that house again.

07:46.592 --> 07:48.385
That's where he'll go,
the simple fuck.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.267
I spotted it.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.436
Closing, 11 o'clock.

07:58.187 --> 08:00.397
It's the house all right,
looks pretty dead.

08:02.357 --> 08:03.442
Over there.

08:52.616 --> 08:54.743
Hey, Bert, old buddy.
Reading me?

08:55.994 --> 08:58.080
That's right, you no-good,
double-crossing,

08:58.288 --> 09:00.123
scum-sucking son of a bitch.

09:00.833 --> 09:02.167
We are alive.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.545
Damn it, I can't believe it.

09:04.711 --> 09:07.548
- Jack, what's wrong?
- I dropped my harmonica.

09:07.714 --> 09:10.509
You can blow Bert's balls off.
Come on, let's find him.

09:10.676 --> 09:13.512
All right, Bert.
Now it's personal.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.948
- Bang.
- I'm dead.

11:08.627 --> 11:13.090
By the way, Bert, buddy,
we owe you a live grenade, pal.

11:13.256 --> 11:15.384
We'll nail you up
like one of these scarecrows.

11:15.550 --> 11:17.427
Then we're gonna burn you, Bert,

11:17.636 --> 11:19.846
just like you burned us,
motherfucker.

11:53.422 --> 11:55.716
- Hold it, I saw a light.
- Where?

11:55.924 --> 11:57.759
By the house, a car, maybe.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.096
You're crow shit, Bert.

12:03.849 --> 12:06.935
God to Bert,
your birthday's been canceled.

12:07.102 --> 12:09.855
Hey, Corb, hope you didn't
forget your buffalo gun.

12:10.022 --> 12:12.441
- She's right here.
- That's too cruel, man.

12:12.607 --> 12:14.818
That's the gun with
the exploding shells.

12:14.985 --> 12:17.112
And, Bert, this ammo is blessed.

12:17.279 --> 12:18.905
So when I blow
your ass away, buddy,

12:19.114 --> 12:21.158
every piece of you
is going straight to hell.

12:41.636 --> 12:43.597
Over there, the lights,
they're moving.

12:43.764 --> 12:46.141
- Where? Come in.
- It's a truck.

12:46.349 --> 12:49.352
Southeast of you.
It's gotta be Bert. Move.

12:49.519 --> 12:51.897
The cornfield.
He's going after the money.

12:52.064 --> 12:54.107
Rox, your transmission's
breaking up.

12:54.274 --> 12:57.194
Curry, Jack, come in.
Where are you?

12:57.360 --> 12:59.446
Damn it. We're out of range.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.448
Hey, Bert, you dumb fuck,

13:01.656 --> 13:03.700
there's only one road
and we're on it.

13:35.357 --> 13:37.609
This isn't exactly Route 66, is it?

13:39.778 --> 13:41.404
Here, hold this, will you?

13:42.447 --> 13:44.074
It says “Keep out.”

13:45.283 --> 13:46.910
Will you just hold this?

13:51.873 --> 13:55.168
Come on out here, Bert,
you son of a bitch.

13:55.377 --> 13:58.547
I'm gonna rip your heart out
and feed it to you on a stick.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.467
- Give me that.
- Here.

14:09.141 --> 14:12.435
- What's in there?
- The Playboy Mansion.

14:12.602 --> 14:15.355
- That's it?
- Scarecrows.

14:18.150 --> 14:19.276
Scarecrows.

14:19.442 --> 14:22.279
- Jack, Curry, come in.
- We're here.

14:22.445 --> 14:24.614
Bert's heading for the gate.
Are you guys on that road?

14:25.282 --> 14:27.242
- Yeah.
- Well, stay on it.

14:27.409 --> 14:29.452
He's gonna have to come
through you guys.

14:29.619 --> 14:30.704
Here.

14:35.125 --> 14:38.086
Coming to get you, Bert,
you son of a bitch.

14:45.260 --> 14:46.720
Good job.

14:46.887 --> 14:49.890
Come on, Jack.
Heaven can't wait for you.

14:54.561 --> 14:55.729
Heaven?

14:56.479 --> 14:58.940
Graveyard has gotta
be on this road.

15:00.358 --> 15:02.611
There. There it is.

16:05.715 --> 16:07.467
Can't you fly this crate
any faster?

16:07.634 --> 16:08.635
I'm in full throttle.

16:08.802 --> 16:10.136
He picked up the money.
He's getting away.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.429
You're pathetic.

16:11.596 --> 16:14.140
Should I splatter your face
around the cockpit or what?

16:14.307 --> 16:16.685
There he is.
Swing around and get him.

16:16.851 --> 16:18.478
Swing around again.

16:25.443 --> 16:26.987
He's headed your way, guys.

16:27.153 --> 16:30.573
- Which way is that?
- Behind us or in front of us?

16:30.740 --> 16:32.909
Stupid assholes.

16:36.621 --> 16:39.082
Damn, he's turning off the road.

16:39.249 --> 16:40.792
I'm coming down.

16:41.001 --> 16:42.294
Look for a place to land.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.632
This terrain's for shit.
We can't land down here.

16:47.799 --> 16:48.800
We're landing.

16:48.967 --> 16:52.095
- You'll never make it. Never!
- Kellie, stay out of this.

16:54.931 --> 16:56.766
You know, Bert,
we were kind of hoping

16:56.975 --> 16:58.310
you were coming down that road

16:58.476 --> 17:00.562
to give us back our money
and straighten things out,

17:00.729 --> 17:03.106
but you let us down again.

17:03.273 --> 17:05.817
Now you've gone
too far, dirtball.

17:05.983 --> 17:09.695
Yeah, Bert, I think I'm gonna
have to cut you out of my will.

17:13.825 --> 17:16.328
God damn, now what?

17:20.415 --> 17:21.624
The tank's full.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.127
The fucking thing's flooded.

17:33.261 --> 17:34.679
What the...

17:36.097 --> 17:38.975
No engine? Wait a minute.

17:40.727 --> 17:43.396
This is impossible.
What is this?

17:44.314 --> 17:46.024
Some kind of fucking joke?

17:54.324 --> 17:55.241
Listen up, guys.

17:55.450 --> 17:57.744
Bert's stopped the truck.
I can't tell what he's up to.

17:57.952 --> 18:01.247
But he's on foot now about a
half mile west of the house.

18:01.414 --> 18:04.334
We're almost there.
I can smell him, he's toast.

18:04.501 --> 18:05.585
No, take him alive.

18:05.794 --> 18:08.338
The first bullet through
his head is mine.

18:08.546 --> 18:10.340
We're landing
this sucker right now.

18:14.969 --> 18:16.763
There's a field at 4 o'clock.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.267
It may be long enough.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.811
So, how's it feel, Bert?

18:22.977 --> 18:24.938
I mean, it must
be awful frustrating

18:25.105 --> 18:28.066
to have to die with all that
money in your hands.

18:28.233 --> 18:31.027
Yeah, real frustrating.

18:37.492 --> 18:39.577
That money must be getting
awful heavy.

18:39.744 --> 18:42.455
$3.5 million is
a lot of bread for one guy.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.499
It ain't right to be so greedy.

18:44.666 --> 18:46.751
All right, asshole,
just hold it right there.

18:46.918 --> 18:48.711
- You see him?
- Shut up.

18:48.878 --> 18:51.423
Oh, yeah, yeah. There he is.

18:51.589 --> 18:53.091
Hey, Bert,
we're gonna hang you up

18:53.299 --> 18:54.467
like one of these scarecrows

18:54.634 --> 18:56.177
and stuff you full of crow shit.

18:56.344 --> 18:59.097
Hey, Corbin,
start bagging some crow turds.

18:59.264 --> 19:00.640
He didn't hear you, man.

19:00.849 --> 19:03.226
He's into his jungles
and Rambo bullshit.

19:03.393 --> 19:04.686
With his radio turned off,
right?

19:04.894 --> 19:06.020
Whoa, there he is again.

19:06.229 --> 19:08.106
I got him on my scope.
Don't move.

19:09.441 --> 19:10.692
Stand still, Bert.

19:11.443 --> 19:13.945
Just one second,
it'll all be over.

19:14.446 --> 19:16.698
Turn around, Bert.
I wanna shoot you in the back.

19:16.865 --> 19:18.032
Over here.

19:22.620 --> 19:23.746
Where is he?

19:27.667 --> 19:28.751
He's coming toward us.

19:28.918 --> 19:31.838
Keep coming, Bert.
You're heading right for me.

19:32.005 --> 19:34.007
I don't even have to move.

19:35.008 --> 19:37.469
Over here, Bert, on your left.

19:38.219 --> 19:41.139
- Pretty lousy shooting.
- Bert's aim always sucked.

19:41.306 --> 19:43.266
Everything he did sucked.

19:43.433 --> 19:46.227
Now we're both right behind you,
asshole.

20:07.373 --> 20:10.418
We got you covered, Bert,
from behind these scarecrows.

20:15.215 --> 20:17.550
Put the gun down.
You're not going to hurt us.

20:20.637 --> 20:21.846
Curry?

20:23.389 --> 20:24.474
Jack?

20:25.892 --> 20:28.520
Curry? Jack?

20:28.728 --> 20:31.523
Look, you want the money?
Take it.

20:32.607 --> 20:33.733
Curry!

20:34.526 --> 20:36.319
Jack! Take the money.

20:36.486 --> 20:38.321
Please, don't kill me.

20:38.488 --> 20:39.781
Who's he talking to, Curry?

20:41.115 --> 20:43.117
Curry? Jack?

20:43.910 --> 20:46.371
Look, take it.

20:46.579 --> 20:49.165
We don't want your money.
We want your blood, Bert.

20:49.874 --> 20:52.877
Do you want me to run?
Well, I'm not going to, see?

20:53.044 --> 20:55.213
Running's over, Bert.
It's time to bleed.

20:55.380 --> 20:58.049
Like those MP's with their guts
spilling on the runway.

20:58.216 --> 20:59.842
Time to bleed, Bert.

21:00.677 --> 21:03.805
Look, I'm not even
carrying a weapon.

21:04.013 --> 21:05.807
Start praying, Bert.

21:06.266 --> 21:08.142
Look, you want the money?

21:08.810 --> 21:12.438
Well, you can't have it
'cause I've hid it.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.691
So, let's make a deal.

21:23.866 --> 21:26.703
Bert, why don't you
say something, motherfucker?

21:26.869 --> 21:28.580
Come on, scumbag, talk.

21:29.247 --> 21:31.874
Words of wisdom
from a dying man.

22:49.494 --> 22:52.372
Your seatbelt, move. Come on.

22:52.538 --> 22:53.873
Christ, leave her out of this.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.833
- Daddy, stop them...
- Shut up.

22:56.626 --> 22:58.628
Get the ladder down now.

23:02.215 --> 23:05.218
- Look, I'm asking you-
- Don't be a hero, Daddy.

23:05.385 --> 23:07.303
Get the ladder, now!

23:11.015 --> 23:12.225
Look.

23:14.477 --> 23:16.104
Keep your ass on that seat.

23:17.271 --> 23:18.231
No radios.

23:18.398 --> 23:20.149
Nothing's going
to happen to her.

23:24.487 --> 23:25.780
Come on, let's go.

23:32.412 --> 23:33.871
- Hey, Curry.
- What?

23:34.038 --> 23:36.874
How am I gonna live in Mexico
if I don't speak Spanish?

23:37.041 --> 23:39.544
I told you a hundred times,
Paco, I'm gonna teach you.

23:39.711 --> 23:41.713
You're a real pal, amigo.

23:50.638 --> 23:51.806
Lovely.

23:56.018 --> 23:57.645
Hey, the lights are on now.

24:04.318 --> 24:08.197
- What the hell is that?
- Guess we're expected.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.965
This is some creepy shit, man.

24:37.935 --> 24:39.145
Hold it.

24:39.896 --> 24:41.397
Looks like we missed the party.

24:42.273 --> 24:43.316
Bert.

24:43.524 --> 24:45.777
Yeah.
Check out the inside, will you?

24:45.985 --> 24:47.320
Somebody lives here.

24:48.362 --> 24:52.116
Not anymore, they don't.
Come on, check it out inside.

24:52.325 --> 24:54.118
Bullshit, man, you check it out.

24:55.953 --> 24:58.164
You're always
such a fucking pain in the ass.

24:58.331 --> 25:00.124
What am I, your mother?

25:05.630 --> 25:06.923
Hey, Bert.

27:32.944 --> 27:34.403
Christ, you think
about knocking?

27:34.612 --> 27:35.655
Knock, knock.

27:36.280 --> 27:37.657
Asshole.

27:37.823 --> 27:39.116
It's Rambo.

27:40.201 --> 27:41.535
That you, Corbin?

27:42.536 --> 27:43.913
Get down here.

27:44.455 --> 27:45.706
I'm gonna look for Bert.

27:46.374 --> 27:49.752
I'll tell you, whoever
lives or lived here

27:49.961 --> 27:51.671
was very fucking weird.

27:51.837 --> 27:54.256
Into devil worship or some shit.

27:54.465 --> 27:56.884
Hey, guys, I'm coming up
the trail. I can see the house.

27:57.843 --> 27:59.345
Who lives here?

27:59.512 --> 28:01.555
Mailbox says "Fowler."

28:01.722 --> 28:03.724
There's a picture
of three very mangy guys.

28:03.891 --> 28:05.935
Bert could have killed them
but there 's no bodies,

28:06.102 --> 28:08.521
just some very ugly vibes.

28:08.688 --> 28:10.940
Slow down,
I'm getting stickers everywhere.

28:11.107 --> 28:12.984
You'll live. Come on.

28:30.042 --> 28:32.837
Let me go.
I'm not going anywhere.

28:37.341 --> 28:38.676
Where's Jack?

28:39.260 --> 28:40.803
Jack's still up on the roof.

28:43.556 --> 28:46.642
Hey, Jack, come on
down here, will you?

28:47.351 --> 28:50.438
- Yo, Jack.
- I found it, the parachute.

28:50.604 --> 28:52.273
- Jackpot! Where?
- At least one of them.

28:52.481 --> 28:55.526
- Where is it, Jack?
- It's by these three big crosses.

28:56.110 --> 28:59.321
That's weird,
there's no scarecrows on them.

28:59.488 --> 29:01.115
Great, what else?

29:09.790 --> 29:10.875
Shit.

29:11.083 --> 29:12.626
Come on, get down here,
will you?

29:15.087 --> 29:16.380
For Christ's sake.

29:16.547 --> 29:19.300
I saw a scarecrow,
out there somewhere.

29:19.467 --> 29:21.427
Jack, where's the parachute?

29:21.594 --> 29:23.387
No, no, the scarecrow thing,
it was...

29:23.554 --> 29:24.635
Come on, they're everywhere.

29:24.805 --> 29:26.406
They're all over the place.
Give me this.

29:26.599 --> 29:28.726
Jack, the parachute?

29:29.435 --> 29:33.397
Yeah, it was by these crosses.
You can see it from the roof.

29:39.695 --> 29:40.988
Come on, we're wasting time.

29:41.197 --> 29:42.907
The whole damn army's
looking for us.

29:43.074 --> 29:45.242
We'll follow Bert's
tire tracks out front.

29:45.409 --> 29:46.869
I'll stay with the girl.

29:47.036 --> 29:48.579
Let's go, Jack.

29:48.746 --> 29:51.791
Get away from there before
a scarecrow grabs you, huh?

29:59.673 --> 30:01.675
Bert ran over this one.

30:09.934 --> 30:11.143
Come on, let's go.

30:16.607 --> 30:17.767
Curry, do you get the feeling

30:17.817 --> 30:19.276
- we're being watched?
- NO-

30:19.443 --> 30:21.445
Then how come your finger's
on the trigger?

30:21.612 --> 30:23.197
Shut up, asshole.

30:23.364 --> 30:26.117
I think this place is possessed
by demonic demons.

30:26.325 --> 30:28.536
Your head's gonna be possessed
by the butt of my gun

30:28.744 --> 30:30.371
if you don't shut up.

30:31.288 --> 30:33.499
Demonic demons. Christ.

31:13.539 --> 31:15.166
Get all the stickers out?

31:16.292 --> 31:18.919
Here. Try a little rouge.

31:20.588 --> 31:22.381
It'll make you look happier.

31:27.386 --> 31:29.513
Curry, keep moving
about 10 degrees past

31:29.722 --> 31:31.265
that little bush on your left.

31:31.807 --> 31:33.017
Then turn right.

31:33.225 --> 31:35.561
Hey, Jack, do you have
any idea where you're going?

31:35.769 --> 31:38.397
- We're almost there.
- This way?

31:39.607 --> 31:42.359
See those crosses?
Just to the left.

31:55.706 --> 31:58.125
If I were a crow
I'd be someplace else.

31:58.959 --> 32:00.461
- Corbin?
- Forget it.

32:00.628 --> 32:02.463
He's turned off
his radio again,

32:02.630 --> 32:04.465
so he can go apeshit
by himself.

32:04.673 --> 32:07.343
Yo, Corb, you in the bush
pulling your pipe?

32:08.219 --> 32:10.429
Damn,
I really miss my harmonica.

32:17.353 --> 32:21.982
Coasting status Alpha one one,
Alpha one niner.

32:22.191 --> 32:26.028
Roger, Alpha one one,
one niner. Negatory.

32:27.446 --> 32:29.823
One eight alpha whiskey,
gaining in altitude.

32:30.032 --> 32:34.245
Base, we're heading...
One niner. 3,000...

32:34.828 --> 32:38.999
Heading... one niner.
One zero zero.

32:39.166 --> 32:43.462
From sectors Delta one zero
to Delta one six.

32:44.296 --> 32:47.091
On our way, let's hope we're
on the wanted this time.

33:08.737 --> 33:11.407
Son of a bitch, it isn't here!
He took it!

33:12.408 --> 33:13.826
Come on.

33:28.382 --> 33:30.426
This place gives me the creeps.

33:31.343 --> 33:32.970
- Curry?
- What?

33:33.679 --> 33:35.889
I said those things
give me the creeps.

33:36.098 --> 33:37.618
Yeah, well they
give me the creeps too.

33:37.766 --> 33:39.446
Why don't you just stop
talking about them?

33:39.560 --> 33:41.401
Can you imagine hanging
on one of those things?

33:41.437 --> 33:43.230
You know they had to put the
nail through your wrists

33:43.439 --> 33:44.815
because your hands'
little bones would keep-

33:45.024 --> 33:46.483
Can't use nails.

33:46.692 --> 33:48.013
Those things are
made out of metal

33:48.027 --> 33:49.862
and you can't use
nails on metal.

33:50.070 --> 33:52.573
What if they used a little
metal bolt or something?

33:52.781 --> 33:54.825
- He'd still have to-
- Would you just shut up?

33:55.200 --> 33:58.495
Just some kind of
superstitious things

33:58.704 --> 34:00.414
used to ward off evil spirits.

34:00.622 --> 34:02.374
Hey, Corbin, wait up.

34:22.895 --> 34:25.898
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

34:26.065 --> 34:28.233
Daddy! Where are you, Daddy?

34:28.442 --> 34:30.777
Daddy, Daddy, help!

34:30.985 --> 34:34.239
Help me! Please help me, Daddy!

34:44.375 --> 34:46.502
Roxanne, we found Bert's truck.

34:46.710 --> 34:48.504
Looks like the bastard's in it.

34:58.889 --> 35:01.642
WORZ news time, it's 3:00.

35:01.850 --> 35:05.437
Top story: Cuban refugees
are holding 30 hostages...

35:05.646 --> 35:10.943
Alright, Bert, come on out.
Let's not make a mess here.

35:11.151 --> 35:12.945
Meanwhile,
here in the Southland,

35:13.153 --> 35:15.823
one of the biggest manhunts in
California history continues.

35:16.031 --> 35:18.450
Federal agents aided
by Marine helicopters

35:18.659 --> 35:20.494
tracked down the
hijacked plane after

35:20.702 --> 35:22.913
last night's brutal robbery...

35:31.213 --> 35:33.006
Son of a bitch.

35:33.215 --> 35:35.092
- Curry?
- Bart's playing games.

35:35.300 --> 35:37.970
He put a goddamn
scarecrow in the truck.

35:39.263 --> 35:42.516
- He's fucking with us.
- We're running out of time, boys.

35:42.724 --> 35:44.017
If we don't find that money soon

35:44.226 --> 35:45.769
the Army's gonna
have us for breakfast.

36:01.160 --> 36:03.912
...and on the subject of money,
two people were lucky enough

36:04.121 --> 36:07.916
to have selected the six winning
numbers on their lotto 649 card.

36:08.125 --> 36:10.586
So they'll split a jackpot
of 12 million dollars

36:10.794 --> 36:12.588
spread over a 20-year period.

36:12.838 --> 36:15.549
WORZ news time, 3:01.

36:29.146 --> 36:30.564
My luck.

36:30.731 --> 36:32.608
I don 't like this
one bit, Curry.

36:32.774 --> 36:34.234
We're being set up
bigger than shit.

36:34.443 --> 36:35.110
I can feel it.

36:35.319 --> 36:37.821
Well, take your hand out of your
pocket and stop feeling it.

36:37.988 --> 36:39.490
Come on,
these are his footprints.

36:39.656 --> 36:42.743
Which ones? These or these?

36:42.910 --> 36:45.120
These, the boot prints.

36:45.287 --> 36:48.040
Then who made the other ones?
They're just as fresh.

36:48.207 --> 36:50.834
Fuck, I don't know, Jack.
Your damn scarecrow, all right?

36:51.001 --> 36:53.086
Is that what you want to hear?

36:58.759 --> 36:59.927
Look.

37:00.761 --> 37:03.096
Hey, there it is.
Right there, look.

37:03.263 --> 37:04.723
- There it is.
- What?

37:04.890 --> 37:07.935
The money, you idiot.
Now, go on up and get it.

37:08.101 --> 37:11.063
- What the hell is that?
- Bert's chute.

37:11.230 --> 37:12.397
It's the money.

37:12.564 --> 37:15.692
Now, for Christ's sake,
go on up and cut it down.

37:15.859 --> 37:19.696
- You cut it down.
- Jack, just go up and cut it down.

37:21.823 --> 37:24.034
You cover me.
If anything happens to me...

37:24.201 --> 37:26.662
Yeah, yeah.
Come on, let's have it.

37:39.841 --> 37:42.052
Come on, cut it.

37:42.219 --> 37:46.223
For Christ's sake, just cut it, will you?
Come on, pennies from heaven.

37:50.018 --> 37:51.645
Jack!

37:51.812 --> 37:53.647
Shit!

37:55.023 --> 37:56.692
Jesus Christ!

38:04.032 --> 38:05.200
Curry?

38:08.787 --> 38:10.122
Curry?

38:10.289 --> 38:11.999
We're on the way
back to the house.

38:12.165 --> 38:13.500
Curry's not feeling too good.

38:13.667 --> 38:15.294
Bert's not gonna feel
too good either

38:15.460 --> 38:16.670
- ...when I find him.
- What?

38:16.837 --> 38:19.339
Bert booby-trapped his chute
with some blood and stuff.

38:19.506 --> 38:22.009
And now it's all over me,
Bert, funny man,

38:22.175 --> 38:23.635
like I'm gonna be all over you

38:23.844 --> 38:25.470
when I find you,
you motherfucker.

38:25.637 --> 38:28.724
- Chill out, Curry.
- You 're a dead man, Bert.

38:28.890 --> 38:31.977
A corpse, you hear me, Bert?
A dead man.

38:32.144 --> 38:34.354
- Curry, we'll find him.
- Dead!

39:10.015 --> 39:11.600
That's too weird.

39:25.781 --> 39:26.865
Bert!

39:31.620 --> 39:33.580
- Curry.
- What the hell is it?

39:33.747 --> 39:34.956
- He's here.
- What?

39:35.123 --> 39:36.249
Bert's at the house.

39:36.416 --> 39:38.960
There is a God.
Coming right up.

39:42.172 --> 39:43.965
Fuck him up, come on.

39:47.052 --> 39:50.263
Stop your bullshit games, man,
you tried to fuck us.

39:50.430 --> 39:52.265
Now, where's the goddamn money?

39:52.432 --> 39:54.226
Bert, we're gonna
get it out of you,

39:54.434 --> 39:55.268
one way or another.

39:55.435 --> 39:56.853
Where is it?

40:01.149 --> 40:02.693
Let's just start
with his hand, huh?

40:02.859 --> 40:05.821
Let's just start with
his goddamn fingers.

40:05.987 --> 40:08.156
Who were you shooting at, huh?

40:09.533 --> 40:11.159
Where's the money?

40:13.078 --> 40:15.038
What's your goddamn name?

40:17.624 --> 40:19.793
Stop it, you're killing him!

40:23.588 --> 40:26.383
- Stop it!
- Change her diaper, will you?

40:34.057 --> 40:35.475
You stay out of it.

40:43.442 --> 40:45.861
Jack, where have you been?

40:46.027 --> 40:49.281
Found some green stalks
down by the stream. Hungry?

40:49.448 --> 40:51.491
Motherfucker,
you planned this heist,

40:51.658 --> 40:53.118
and you planned
to double-cross us

40:53.326 --> 40:54.411
right from day fucking one.

40:54.578 --> 40:57.038
Come on, harder.

40:57.205 --> 40:58.790
Piece of shit.

40:58.999 --> 41:01.501
All that time you were just
jacking us off with sandpaper.

41:01.710 --> 41:02.627
Kick his ass.

41:02.794 --> 41:07.215
Hey, there, want an ear?
Best way to eat corn.

41:07.424 --> 41:09.384
Get away from me,
you cold-blooded bastard,

41:09.593 --> 41:10.510
just get away!

41:10.719 --> 41:12.804
Look, leave her alone,
Jack, okay?

41:16.933 --> 41:20.270
Sack of shit. I'll watch him.

41:22.731 --> 41:24.900
- He's a dead end.
- Man.

41:31.114 --> 41:33.408
We're gonna have
to sweep the area.

41:33.575 --> 41:36.578
We'll get it back,
that double-crossing scum.

41:36.745 --> 41:39.831
I've never seen anybody
stand a beating like Bert just did.

41:39.998 --> 41:41.416
He hardly even bled.

41:41.583 --> 41:44.085
Maybe he got a concussion
or something when he landed.

41:44.252 --> 41:45.295
He must have
because he was numb

41:45.462 --> 41:47.506
even before I started
smashing his skull in.

41:47.672 --> 41:49.132
I don't think he can even talk.

41:49.299 --> 41:50.300
I don't buy it.

41:50.467 --> 41:52.302
I think the son of a bitch
took some drugs or something,

41:52.469 --> 41:53.929
then walked in here
hoping we'd kick his ass

41:54.137 --> 41:54.846
and leave him for dead.

41:55.013 --> 41:56.515
Leaving him with all the money.

41:56.681 --> 41:58.350
He knew we'd find him
dragging that cash around,

41:58.517 --> 42:00.727
so he stashed it and took
his chances coming up here.

42:00.894 --> 42:02.255
So now the fucker
is laughing at us

42:02.270 --> 42:04.606
'cause he fried his brain
and we can't get to him.

42:04.773 --> 42:05.732
Well, the joke's on him

42:05.899 --> 42:08.459
'cause I'm gonna be standing on
his dick when he comes out of it.

42:08.485 --> 42:10.278
He's just sitting there
mocking us.

42:10.445 --> 42:12.165
Right behind that face
he's laughing so hard

42:12.197 --> 42:14.074
he's going to bust out
any moment.

42:20.163 --> 42:23.166
All right, asshole, where is it?

42:23.333 --> 42:24.960
Forget it, Curry.

42:27.879 --> 42:29.548
What's the matter, Curry?

42:30.382 --> 42:32.008
Can't you take it?

42:39.015 --> 42:40.559
Jack, help!

42:42.561 --> 42:44.271
Jack, over here!
I'm stuck to this guy!

42:44.437 --> 42:45.856
Curry, move!
Get out of the way!

42:46.022 --> 42:47.983
God damn it, move! Move!

42:53.446 --> 42:54.406
Son of a bitch!

42:54.573 --> 42:56.074
Corbin, hurry!

43:00.912 --> 43:04.291
Curry! Corbin!
Help me, guys! He's not real!

43:04.457 --> 43:06.167
Bastard, put him down!

43:26.646 --> 43:30.025
Jack! Jack, get up!

43:30.191 --> 43:32.277
Corbin, we're gonna go...

43:32.444 --> 43:33.695
Watch out!

43:35.739 --> 43:37.324
Shoot him, Roxanne! Shoot him!

43:37.490 --> 43:39.367
Out of the way, Corbin!

44:06.937 --> 44:09.856
He's not real, man.
What the hell was he on?

44:18.406 --> 44:20.367
Holy fuck,
he's light as a feather.

44:22.911 --> 44:24.663
Cut him open, Corbin.

44:34.673 --> 44:36.633
God, I'm gonna be sick.

44:41.388 --> 44:43.223
No wonder he's so light.

44:43.390 --> 44:45.558
There's nothing in him
except straw and...

44:45.725 --> 44:46.893
Bingo.

44:47.060 --> 44:48.311
The money.

44:49.020 --> 44:52.732
- He ate the goddamn money.
- Hey, Kellie, she's gone, man.

44:57.404 --> 44:59.572
Corbin, go get her!
Don't let them take off!

45:06.037 --> 45:09.040
This is bullshit, man.
We should be taking off.

45:09.207 --> 45:12.085
You think Bert ate that money?
You're all fucking crazy.

45:12.252 --> 45:14.212
Somebody out there
gutted Bert like a fish

45:14.421 --> 45:15.797
and stuffed him full of cash.

45:15.964 --> 45:17.507
Your brains are gutted, dick.

45:17.674 --> 45:19.509
How the hell did he
kick our asses?

45:32.313 --> 45:33.940
Kellie!

45:35.775 --> 45:37.527
Kellie!

45:37.694 --> 45:38.695
Help me.

45:38.862 --> 45:40.822
Honey, please help me.

45:44.784 --> 45:46.161
Oh, Kellie!

45:48.371 --> 45:49.831
Please help me.

45:49.998 --> 45:51.249
Kellie!

45:54.461 --> 45:57.380
It's Daddy, Kellie. Help me.

46:00.133 --> 46:01.384
On, God!

46:10.351 --> 46:11.478
Daddy!

46:24.783 --> 46:26.993
This isn't all of it, you know.

46:27.160 --> 46:29.329
It isn't nearly all of it.

46:29.496 --> 46:31.372
It's hardly any of it.

46:37.587 --> 46:38.880
What if...

46:40.298 --> 46:44.010
You know, whoever lives here,
what if they did that to Bert,

46:45.512 --> 46:47.222
and they're waiting
outside to do it to us?

46:47.388 --> 46:49.224
Why don't you just shut up?

46:49.390 --> 46:50.683
And what if those crosses...

46:50.892 --> 46:53.728
"What if? What if? What if?"
Why don't you just shut up?

46:56.397 --> 46:59.025
Look, let's get out of here.

47:01.653 --> 47:03.822
Let's take the money
we have and split it.

47:05.281 --> 47:08.326
Bert was walking around dead,
for Christ's sake.

47:13.331 --> 47:15.917
We've got to refrigerate this,
it stinks.

47:17.001 --> 47:18.419
You know...

47:20.338 --> 47:23.133
somebody is trying to
scare us out of here...

47:24.259 --> 47:26.261
so they can get the money.

47:27.679 --> 47:29.764
And we are not leaving now.

47:30.557 --> 47:31.766
No way.

47:33.434 --> 47:35.478
We've come this far.

47:35.645 --> 47:38.231
We are not leaving
without that money.

47:51.161 --> 47:53.371
You bitch! God damn you!

47:53.538 --> 47:54.831
Al's dead.

47:55.373 --> 47:57.375
Somebody out there
killed her father...

47:58.501 --> 47:59.961
just like Bert.

48:03.214 --> 48:04.799
You killed him!

48:04.966 --> 48:06.634
You all killed him.

48:18.938 --> 48:20.857
Is she gonna be able
to fly us out of here?

48:22.442 --> 48:23.776
She has to.

48:44.088 --> 48:45.131
Hey.

48:46.132 --> 48:47.217
Hey!

48:49.802 --> 48:50.762
Hey!

48:51.554 --> 48:52.639
Look!

48:53.473 --> 48:55.808
Oh, my God. The money.

48:55.975 --> 48:57.560
It must have been
in a tree or something

48:57.769 --> 48:58.809
and the wind blew it down.

48:58.853 --> 49:01.689
There's no way the money
spread like that off a tree.

49:01.856 --> 49:03.816
It must have got caught
in an air current

49:04.025 --> 49:05.026
or a wind or something.

49:05.193 --> 49:08.071
- Let's get it.
- And get the hell out of here.

49:08.238 --> 49:11.282
The hell with you guys.
I'm gonna bury her dad.

49:11.449 --> 49:13.493
That's the least we can do.

49:26.214 --> 49:28.007
Hey, don't get too far away,
will you?

49:28.216 --> 49:29.425
Yeah, right.

49:29.634 --> 49:31.886
If you see anything that moves,
shoot it.

49:32.053 --> 49:34.055
I wish I had my harmonica.

49:44.607 --> 49:46.859
Take the path
to your left there.

49:47.026 --> 49:48.778
Yo, Roxanne, we're splitting up.

49:48.945 --> 49:51.364
The money is concentrated
in two separate areas.

49:51.531 --> 49:53.283
We'll get it faster.

50:54.594 --> 50:55.887
I'll be damned.

50:56.054 --> 50:58.139
What? What's wrong, Jack?

51:02.894 --> 51:04.437
You're kidding.

51:07.732 --> 51:09.233
Where are you?

51:18.743 --> 51:21.162
Okay, slow down.
I can't see you.

51:21.329 --> 51:23.206
You hear me, jerk?

51:23.706 --> 51:25.124
Jack, wait up.

51:25.583 --> 51:26.667
Jack.

51:27.377 --> 51:28.419
Jack!

51:29.253 --> 51:30.838
Come in, Paco.

51:45.520 --> 51:46.604
Jack?

51:48.314 --> 51:49.607
Jack!

51:49.774 --> 51:51.359
I'm coming, Jack. I'm coming.

51:51.526 --> 51:52.527
- Which way?
- Curry?

51:52.735 --> 51:54.570
Come on, talk to me, Jack!
Which way?

51:54.779 --> 51:55.405
Jack?

51:55.571 --> 51:56.906
Come in, Jack!

51:57.907 --> 51:59.534
Hey, where are you guys?

51:59.992 --> 52:02.912
Hang on, buddy, I'm coming.
Oh, Jesus. I'm coming. Jack!

52:03.079 --> 52:06.165
What's happening? Jack? Curry?

52:06.332 --> 52:08.000
- Jack!
- Come in.

52:08.167 --> 52:10.628
Damn it, Curry.
Where are you guys?

52:12.547 --> 52:13.840
This way, let's move.

52:17.009 --> 52:18.094
Jack!

52:23.224 --> 52:25.768
Jack, which way, man?

53:27.747 --> 53:28.789
Jack?

53:29.749 --> 53:30.958
Jackie?

53:39.592 --> 53:41.594
Jack, don't do this to me.

54:51.872 --> 54:53.874
Curry? Jack?

54:54.083 --> 54:56.669
Where are you? Who's shooting?

54:57.962 --> 54:59.755
- This way.
- I see 'em.

55:01.799 --> 55:03.301
Come on. Let's go.

55:06.304 --> 55:07.722
What are you shooting at?!

55:08.848 --> 55:10.349
Man, they pulled his
fucking guts out!

55:10.558 --> 55:11.642
Where's Jack?

55:13.394 --> 55:15.771
Listen, I fired at this thing...

55:15.980 --> 55:18.733
and it just kept coming.
Bullets don't stop it!

55:18.941 --> 55:21.068
- What are you talking about?
- The scarecrows, man!

55:21.235 --> 55:23.195
Like Humans. They got Jack!

55:26.198 --> 55:27.992
One of them was missing a hand.

55:28.200 --> 55:31.037
They cut off Jack's.
There were three of them.

55:31.203 --> 55:33.748
The Fowlers, those guys
in the picture, well,

55:33.914 --> 55:36.626
they're just fucking scarecrows
and all I shot was straw.

55:40.880 --> 55:42.923
You people don't understand.

55:43.132 --> 55:46.010
These bastards died
and nobody told them.

55:46.218 --> 55:49.013
And if you're packing exploding
shells in that thing, pal,

55:49.221 --> 55:51.098
they'd better be fucking
sacred or silver,

55:51.307 --> 55:53.100
'cause these
fuckers ain't real.

56:32.807 --> 56:34.350
They're never gonna let us
out of here alive,

56:34.558 --> 56:35.643
you know that, don't you?

56:40.022 --> 56:43.401
I mean, it ain't the money
they want, it's us.

56:46.529 --> 56:49.490
We're dealing with some
kind of zombie, something.

56:49.699 --> 56:52.952
I mean, man, they ripped
his fucking liver out

56:53.160 --> 56:54.245
with their bare hands.

56:54.453 --> 56:56.333
Look, we don't need to
hear this again, alright?

56:56.622 --> 56:59.333
I want to leave right now.

56:59.542 --> 57:02.586
Okay, why don't you do that?
I'd like to see you do that.

57:02.795 --> 57:05.047
I mean I think you should
just take a little stroll

57:05.256 --> 57:06.736
right out there in
the moonlight, kid.

57:06.882 --> 57:08.801
They'll rip your tight
little asshole out

57:09.009 --> 57:11.053
before you can say
“Que fucking pasa?”

57:11.262 --> 57:13.389
I'm not one of you.
They don't want me.

57:14.098 --> 57:16.142
Don't worry, kid.
Nobody's gonna hurt us here.

57:18.477 --> 57:21.021
They're just gonna pick us off
one by one, that's all,

57:21.230 --> 57:23.524
just like those crows on
that fucking fence, huh?

57:23.733 --> 57:26.444
Well, you do whatever
you want to do.

57:26.610 --> 57:28.738
I ain't going out there again.
No fucking way.

57:28.946 --> 57:31.365
Alright, Curry,
you got a better idea?

57:31.949 --> 57:33.951
Yes, I have a better idea.

57:34.160 --> 57:35.244
Let's hear it.

57:36.412 --> 57:38.497
Let's just wait
till daybreak, okay?

57:38.706 --> 57:40.386
And leave three and
a half million dollars-

57:40.541 --> 57:42.168
Guns don't work!

57:42.376 --> 57:44.336
Don't you understand?

57:45.171 --> 57:46.839
I tried it already, okay?

57:47.006 --> 57:49.175
The motherfucker
just kept coming.

57:58.017 --> 58:00.218
I mean, you understand what's
happening here, don't you?

58:01.395 --> 58:02.605
Think about it.

58:04.315 --> 58:06.692
You think it's an accident
we're here, huh?

58:06.901 --> 58:09.069
Well, you tell me why is it

58:09.278 --> 58:12.406
that those MP's just kept firing
at us and they kept missing?

58:12.615 --> 58:14.950
And we kept firing at them,
and they kept falling.

58:15.159 --> 58:16.952
They kept coming and
firing and missing,

58:17.161 --> 58:18.954
we kept firing,
they kept falling.

58:19.163 --> 58:20.581
Why is that?

58:24.210 --> 58:25.836
Don't you understand nothing?

58:27.213 --> 58:30.007
We got away too clean,
don't you see that?

58:30.216 --> 58:32.009
Then we land here, see,

58:32.218 --> 58:34.053
and then it's Bert,
and then it's Jack,

58:34.261 --> 58:36.722
and then it's all of us.
Just one by one, all of us.

58:49.944 --> 58:51.320
What if...

58:53.280 --> 58:55.616
What if they didn't
miss us, man?

58:55.825 --> 58:58.077
What if they hit us, and...

59:00.538 --> 59:01.539
Maybe...

59:02.706 --> 59:04.291
We're dead.

59:07.044 --> 59:09.672
And we're not...
I mean, we're not really here.

59:09.839 --> 59:11.507
This isn't real.

59:11.715 --> 59:13.592
I mean, we're here, but...

59:14.176 --> 59:16.554
none of this is really...

59:48.252 --> 59:50.254
- What was that?
- What?

59:55.384 --> 59:56.760
Who is that?

01:00:04.184 --> 01:00:05.769
Hey, man, he's here.

01:00:05.936 --> 01:00:09.064
Hey, Jack!
Man, where've you been, huh?

01:00:12.526 --> 01:00:14.695
Oh, Jesus, man,
I thought you were toast.

01:00:16.947 --> 01:00:18.198
Hey, man, where are you?

01:00:20.784 --> 01:00:22.453
Curry, who the hell
are you talking to?

01:00:23.287 --> 01:00:25.164
Jack, he's on the radio.
What, are you deaf?

01:00:25.331 --> 01:00:26.916
Hey, man, where're you at?

01:00:29.209 --> 01:00:31.045
I don't hear anything.

01:00:41.931 --> 01:00:43.474
What are you trying to pull?

01:00:46.894 --> 01:00:50.022
Look, Curry, let's get the hell
out of here right away, okay?

01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:51.982
We'll get the rest of the money
on the way to the plane.

01:00:52.191 --> 01:00:53.150
- Come on.
- No!

01:00:54.401 --> 01:00:56.320
Jack's on his way
back to the house.

01:00:56.528 --> 01:00:57.404
He's got the money.

01:00:57.571 --> 01:00:58.489
Jack is dead, man.

01:00:58.656 --> 01:01:00.783
He's on his way back to
the house with the money!

01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:03.702
- The money is outside.
- You, shut up!

01:01:03.869 --> 01:01:07.039
Curry, look, if we don't leave
right now they'll kill us.

01:01:07.957 --> 01:01:09.166
You go.

01:01:10.125 --> 01:01:11.961
Those things don't go down, man.

01:01:12.127 --> 01:01:15.005
Now Jack is on his way
back to the house,

01:01:15.172 --> 01:01:17.216
and I'm not leaving here
without him.

01:01:17.424 --> 01:01:19.343
Curry, Jack's not coming back.

01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:21.345
He's dead.

01:01:22.972 --> 01:01:25.099
What are you doing
with Jack's gun, huh?

01:01:26.558 --> 01:01:27.559
'III

01:01:27.726 --> 01:01:29.770
How are we supposed
to get out of here

01:01:29.979 --> 01:01:31.730
if Jack doesn't have his gun?

01:01:31.897 --> 01:01:34.483
All right, Curry.
All right, I'll give it to you.

01:01:34.692 --> 01:01:36.276
You give it to Jack, all right?

01:01:37.152 --> 01:01:38.445
All right.

01:01:40.322 --> 01:01:41.865
Now you just get out of here.

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:43.701
We'll be fine.

01:01:43.909 --> 01:01:46.328
Me and Jack,
we don't need anybody else.

01:01:46.495 --> 01:01:47.975
Now you just get
the hell out of here.

01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:49.798
- You serious?
- God damn right, I'm serious.

01:01:49.832 --> 01:01:51.166
- Let's get out of here, Kellie.
- Get out!

01:01:51.333 --> 01:01:54.211
- Curry, come with us.
- Just get the hell out!

01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:56.463
- No trouble, man, no trouble.
- Get out.

01:01:58.007 --> 01:01:59.174
Get out.

01:02:00.009 --> 01:02:01.176
Get out!

01:02:02.553 --> 01:02:04.430
Come on, move it!
Let's go, let's go!

01:02:06.223 --> 01:02:07.891
Come on, we can make it!
Come on!

01:02:15.274 --> 01:02:17.234
It's Dax, they're hurting him!
Dax?

01:02:17.443 --> 01:02:19.653
Kellie, don't listen!
It's not your dog!

01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:21.822
Don't listen!
It's the scarecrows!

01:02:22.448 --> 01:02:23.699
Dax, I'm coming!

01:02:23.866 --> 01:02:25.993
Kellie, come back,
it's not Dax!

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:27.578
- Come on, she's going after Dax!
- Kellie!

01:02:27.745 --> 01:02:29.413
- Don't hurt him!
- It can't!

01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:31.331
Stop! Kellie!

01:02:31.498 --> 01:02:33.083
Daxie, I'm coming!

01:02:41.467 --> 01:02:43.260
Daxie, where are you?

01:02:43.427 --> 01:02:45.721
- This way.
- I'm coming, Daxie!

01:02:49.850 --> 01:02:51.477
Look, I found more money.

01:02:51.643 --> 01:02:53.520
Forget the money.
Come on, let's go.

01:02:53.687 --> 01:02:55.397
Come on, Roxanne.
Forget the money.

01:02:55.606 --> 01:02:57.316
We're getting out of here.
Come on!

01:03:00.319 --> 01:03:02.696
Kellie,
we have to get to the plane!

01:03:02.905 --> 01:03:04.740
Come back, Kellie.
Where are you?

01:03:04.907 --> 01:03:06.158
Kellie!

01:03:06.325 --> 01:03:08.744
Roxanne, we gotta make a run
for the plane now.

01:03:08.911 --> 01:03:09.828
I'll meet you there.

01:03:09.995 --> 01:03:11.538
Go there now.
I gotta get Kellie.

01:03:11.705 --> 01:03:13.832
You hear me? Do it. Roxanne!

01:03:23.342 --> 01:03:24.426
Dax?

01:03:26.053 --> 01:03:27.096
Dax?

01:03:31.391 --> 01:03:32.518
Daxie?

01:04:24.194 --> 01:04:25.320
Daxie?

01:04:26.822 --> 01:04:27.823
Dax?

01:04:29.533 --> 01:04:30.659
Daxie?

01:04:32.327 --> 01:04:33.787
Dax, come here.

01:04:34.413 --> 01:04:35.706
Come here.

01:04:52.931 --> 01:04:54.141
Daxie?

01:04:56.810 --> 01:04:57.811
Dax?

01:05:20.709 --> 01:05:23.045
Come on,
your dog's at the plane.

01:05:24.421 --> 01:05:25.964
Roxanne?

01:05:26.131 --> 01:05:27.591
Come in, Roxanne.

01:05:27.758 --> 01:05:29.158
We're getting out
of here right now.

01:05:29.301 --> 01:05:30.141
Meet us at the plane.

01:05:30.177 --> 01:05:32.346
Just forget the damn money
and get to the plane.

01:05:32.512 --> 01:05:34.192
It's not worth it.
Do you hear me, Roxanne?

01:05:34.306 --> 01:05:36.725
Forget the goddamn money.
It's not worth it.

01:05:36.892 --> 01:05:40.354
Roxanne! Roxanne, come in!
Roxanne!

01:06:11.468 --> 01:06:13.804
Hey, Jack. Cémo estés?

01:06:19.726 --> 01:06:21.228
He!!! Jack, man.

01:06:23.897 --> 01:06:25.816
You never grow up, huh?

01:06:28.777 --> 01:06:30.195
He!!! Paco!

01:06:43.375 --> 01:06:45.043
There's the plane.

01:06:50.841 --> 01:06:52.009
Come on!

01:06:56.221 --> 01:06:57.347
Come on!

01:06:57.514 --> 01:06:58.682
Come on!

01:07:00.142 --> 01:07:01.893
Come on, let's go! Hurry up!

01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:04.021
Watch the wire.
I got it. Go under!

01:07:04.187 --> 01:07:05.272
Go on!

01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:15.115
Fly the hell
out of here, Kellie!

01:07:15.324 --> 01:07:16.408
Hurry, get away!

01:07:18.201 --> 01:07:21.163
Run! Don't stop, Kellie!
Run, run!

01:07:21.371 --> 01:07:22.748
Get out of here! Keep running!

01:08:15.967 --> 01:08:17.051
Jack?

01:08:20.596 --> 01:08:22.849
Look, you fall on me,
you're dead.

01:08:57.008 --> 01:08:59.719
- Hello?
- Hello, Curry.

01:08:59.886 --> 01:09:02.848
- Hello?
- Over here, in the fridge.

01:09:05.225 --> 01:09:08.395
Reach out and touch someone.

01:09:28.165 --> 01:09:31.542
Well, who is it?

01:09:32.169 --> 01:09:33.252
Jack?

01:09:54.357 --> 01:09:55.358
Jack?

01:09:59.529 --> 01:10:02.949
Hey, Jack. Is that you, huh?

01:10:07.537 --> 01:10:09.789
Motherfucker,
don't play games with me!

01:10:14.044 --> 01:10:15.086
Jack?

01:10:15.545 --> 01:10:17.088
Hey, Paco.

01:10:17.881 --> 01:10:19.174
It's me.

01:10:29.935 --> 01:10:31.935
I'm okay, let's go.
Let's get the hell out of here!

01:10:48.662 --> 01:10:50.830
Roxanne? Curry?

01:10:50.997 --> 01:10:53.917
Can you hear me?
We're at the plane.

01:10:54.084 --> 01:10:55.460
- Hey, Curry.
- You can still make it if you come now.

01:10:55.627 --> 01:10:57.379
- How come you locked me out, man?
- This is your last chance.

01:10:57.546 --> 01:11:00.757
Let me in there, amigo.
There are scarecrows out here.

01:11:00.924 --> 01:11:03.969
Hurry up, Paco.
They're getting closer.

01:11:04.135 --> 01:11:06.638
I'm not fooling around.
Let me in, Curry.

01:11:06.805 --> 01:11:09.849
Gee, these fucking things,
they're definitely demonic.

01:11:10.016 --> 01:11:12.811
Curry, you're not one of them,
are you, man?

01:11:12.978 --> 01:11:14.104
Tell me you're not.

01:11:14.271 --> 01:11:17.274
Curry, open the fucking door.
It's me, man. It's Jack.

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:19.609
Open the goddamn fucking door!

01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:36.960
Hey, Curry,

01:11:37.127 --> 01:11:40.171
how are we gonna live in Mexico
if we're dead?

01:13:03.588 --> 01:13:06.216
It's okay, Daxie.
We're gonna be okay.

01:14:43.688 --> 01:14:47.525
Kellie! Kellie!
I'm coming, Kellie! I'm coming!

01:14:54.032 --> 01:14:55.283

01:14:55.992 --> 01:14:58.036
Please, Daddy, no!

01:14:58.203 --> 01:15:00.163
Daddy, stop, no!

01:15:01.748 --> 01:15:03.208
Daddy, no!

01:15:03.416 --> 01:15:05.460
Corbin! Help me!

01:15:11.883 --> 01:15:14.260
Please, Dad, help me!

01:15:14.469 --> 01:15:16.262
Corbin!

01:15:32.445 --> 01:15:33.822
Corbin?
