14:18.954 --> 14:22.364
Then again.
maybe none of them have a pal like you.

14:26.828 --> 14:29.798
Come on.
I know the perfect place to hide you.

14:35.368 --> 14:36.798
What?

14:38.070 --> 14:39.300
We don't have time.

14:40.705 --> 14:43.135
Okay. but just this once.

14:50.215 --> 14:51.735
How much longer does Bull have?

14:51.915 --> 14:56.375
Well. assuming he still keeps time
as we humans do...

14:56.553 --> 14:58.023
...he's got a couple of minutes.

14:58.188 --> 15:00.178
Well. I hope you're satisfied. Dr. Udell.

15:00.357 --> 15:03.947
Bull wouldn't be in this trouble
if you just left Skippy alone to begin with.

15:04.128 --> 15:07.188
Skippy?
Would you listen to yourselves. people?

15:07.364 --> 15:10.434
Mount Baldy has got you referring
to the creature with a name too.

15:10.601 --> 15:12.131
So. what's wrong with that?

15:12.302 --> 15:15.502
He's humanizing it so you'll feel sorry for it.
don't you understand?

15:15.672 --> 15:17.372
He's making him into a pet.

15:18.441 --> 15:21.601
Could you eat a plate of beef
if you know the name of the cow?

15:22.879 --> 15:24.939
-Brisket of Bernice.
-Florence.

15:25.114 --> 15:26.914
-Filet of Elsie.
-Stop it.

15:27.083 --> 15:30.923
Oh. come on. you're just as much
a carnivore as the rest of us.

15:31.086 --> 15:33.706
Well. doctor.
I for one am not too concerned.

15:33.889 --> 15:37.919
I know Mr. Shannon pretty well. and though
he is prone to these emotional seizures...

15:38.093 --> 15:41.153
...I cannot believe
that he's gonna sacrifice his entire career...

15:41.330 --> 15:42.800
...for the sake of one animal.

15:43.932 --> 15:45.922
Hello. I quit.

15:47.803 --> 15:50.403
I believe you predicted
that Mondale landslide too. sir.

15:50.571 --> 15:54.671
-Will you stop bringing that up?
-I'm sorry. sir. but I thought it over...

15:54.842 --> 15:57.112
...and I realized
I didn't have any choice either.

15:57.278 --> 15:59.868
So you can all forget about the monkey.

16:00.046 --> 16:03.676
I hid him someplace where nobody
will ever think to look for him.

16:03.850 --> 16:05.320
ALL:
The roof?

16:07.220 --> 16:10.420
Skippy was right.
I should have rented him a car.

16:12.057 --> 16:14.617
-All right. people. let's go.
BULL: No. please.

16:14.793 --> 16:17.193
I promised him
I would never let him down.

16:19.198 --> 16:21.628
Looks like he took care of that himself.

16:22.201 --> 16:24.071
UDELL: There he is.
-Skip. what are you doing?

16:24.236 --> 16:25.826
I told you to wait by the chimney.

16:26.003 --> 16:28.733
Well. maybe he got edgy
and wanted to swat down a few planes.

16:28.906 --> 16:30.396
[LAUGHS]

16:31.442 --> 16:34.042
UDELL:
Hi. Skip. Come on. boy. Here. Skip.

16:34.211 --> 16:36.151
Run. Skip. Run while there's still time.

16:36.313 --> 16:37.513
-Stay. Skip.
-Run. Skip.

16:37.681 --> 16:40.341
Pull out their tongues
so they shut up. Skip.

16:42.085 --> 16:43.805
He's moving.

16:48.724 --> 16:52.164
Well. Your Honor.
I think this case is closed.

16:52.328 --> 16:56.228
Skip. why did you do it? You were free.

17:00.102 --> 17:02.802
Oh. I understand.

17:03.773 --> 17:05.762
What did he say?

17:07.410 --> 17:10.310
He says he gave himself up for me.

17:13.048 --> 17:16.708
He says he weighed the options and decided
that my career was more important...

17:16.886 --> 17:20.516
...considering the steadily increasing
competition in the urban-job markets...

17:20.689 --> 17:23.819
...in addition to the unpredictable
cost-of-living fluctuations...

17:23.992 --> 17:26.663
...in most free-enterprise
industrial nations.

17:28.798 --> 17:30.158
Of course. I'm paraphrasing.

17:32.066 --> 17:36.196
Your Honor. if our financial seminar is over.
I've got about a thousand hamsters to feed.

17:36.371 --> 17:40.501
Understood. doctor.
We apologize for the inconvenience.

17:54.389 --> 17:56.449
I know it is. Skip.

17:56.624 --> 17:57.994
You know what is?

17:58.158 --> 18:01.058
Tsk. Doesn't anybody
understand plain English?

18:01.995 --> 18:04.255
-I do.
-Come again?

18:04.798 --> 18:06.728
He said something.

18:06.934 --> 18:08.234
I saw it.

18:08.668 --> 18:12.798
We're gonna need vaccinations.
Whatever it is. it's spreading.

18:14.273 --> 18:18.713
Didn't you see what he did?
He picked up a pencil and he broke it.

18:18.878 --> 18:21.068
Then he held--
Then he held his hands up...

18:21.247 --> 18:24.267
...then he hit my table
and then he picked up my doll.

18:24.449 --> 18:27.349
Very good. sir.

18:28.186 --> 18:30.206
Don't you get it?

18:30.588 --> 18:31.648
Break...

18:31.822 --> 18:33.122
...UP...

18:33.289 --> 18:34.549
...hard...

18:34.724 --> 18:36.564
...voodoo.

18:36.726 --> 18:40.216
Break up hard voodoo.

18:40.897 --> 18:45.727
Breaking up is hard to do.

18:50.038 --> 18:52.768
Right.

18:53.275 --> 18:55.605
That's ridiculous.

18:56.011 --> 18:59.881
People. this is a monkey.

19:00.382 --> 19:01.472
Is that what you said?

19:04.152 --> 19:07.922
That is what he was saying.
Breaking up is hard to do.

19:08.090 --> 19:11.250
Big deal. So he's into Neil Sedaka.

19:13.529 --> 19:15.519
Oh. my God. they're right.

19:16.532 --> 19:18.232
Can this be possible?

19:18.400 --> 19:21.390
Could I be that ignorant
and simple-minded?

19:23.304 --> 19:26.104
All right. it was rhetorical.

19:26.274 --> 19:29.714
-Still feel like filling him with drugs. doc?
-No. no. of course not.

19:29.877 --> 19:33.067
Obviously.
this creature has abilities that I've ignored.

19:33.247 --> 19:35.937
I'll personally see to it
that he is transferred to a facility...

19:36.117 --> 19:38.637
...where he can be monitored
by linguistic specialists.

19:41.055 --> 19:42.075
What did he say?

19:42.256 --> 19:45.086
A broad every now and then
wouldn't hurt either.

19:48.329 --> 19:50.529
I'll see what I can do.

19:52.966 --> 19:54.456
Bull...

19:55.368 --> 19:58.568
...I owe you more than just an apology.
big guy.

19:58.738 --> 20:00.868
I owe you respect.

20:01.041 --> 20:05.001
You were willing to sacrifice your job
and your future...

20:05.178 --> 20:07.168
...even your freedom...

20:07.647 --> 20:08.977
...all for friendship.

20:11.751 --> 20:14.741
The only reward of virtue is virtue.

20:15.055 --> 20:18.685
The only way to have a friend
is to be one.

20:18.925 --> 20:22.515
-Skippy?
-He wrote it in some banana mush.

20:44.284 --> 20:45.624

and continue the slurping?

-No.

I was the one in the elf suit.

21:48.370 --> 21:51.970
You got me in the mailroom and tried to
wrap us and send us to the North Pole.

21:52.141 --> 21:53.581
Was that you?

21:53.742 --> 21:56.372
Remember when I backhanded you
across the face?

21:56.545 --> 21:57.875

21:58.047 --> 22:02.077

I'd file a lawsuit.
