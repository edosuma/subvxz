WEBVTT

00:08.376 --> 00:10.409
- ¶

00:10.411 --> 00:11.910
- Phoebe, did you
get the message?

00:11.912 --> 00:12.878
- Yeah, I got the message.

00:12.880 --> 00:14.380
Teammate celebration
handshake?

00:14.382 --> 00:15.114
- Uh, you know it.

00:15.116 --> 00:18.984
- BOTH: Oh! Ooh!
Ooh! Ooh! Huh! Huh! Whoosh!

00:18.986 --> 00:20.319
- Still not done.

00:20.321 --> 00:22.287
- BOTH:
¶ Ohhhh ¶

00:22.289 --> 00:23.655
¶ Whoosh ¶

00:23.657 --> 00:27.092
- Barb, Max and Phoebe
are getting along.

00:27.094 --> 00:29.228
- I know. I'm scared.

00:29.230 --> 00:30.429
- Okay, guys, remember
when Phoebe and I

00:30.431 --> 00:33.032
saved everyone at the prom
from Dark Mayhem?

00:33.034 --> 00:35.434
- Yes, because
we were also there

00:35.436 --> 00:38.137
saving everyone at
the prom from Dark Mayhem.

00:38.139 --> 00:40.539
- Shhhhh! Quiet.
Heroes are talking.

00:40.541 --> 00:41.373
- HANK:
Oh.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.208
- So, the school board
is honoring us

00:43.210 --> 00:44.209
with this huge painting

00:44.211 --> 00:46.145
of our awesome victory
on the gym wall.

00:46.147 --> 00:48.414
And the best artist
in the school, Smith,

00:48.416 --> 00:49.248
is working on it.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.416
- BARB: Oh!
- HANK: Hey! Hey!

00:50.418 --> 00:52.484
- And when she's done...
bam!

00:52.486 --> 00:54.586
Future generations
will be able to enjoy

00:54.588 --> 00:55.687
my lady amazers.

00:55.689 --> 00:58.023
- BARB: Woohoo!
Congrats!

00:58.025 --> 00:59.625
Oh, honey,
our babies are getting

00:59.627 --> 01:01.427
their first
superhero monument.

01:01.429 --> 01:05.330
- Oh, your historic deed
will live on forever.

01:05.332 --> 01:06.665
- One day, my grandkids

01:06.667 --> 01:08.300
will look at that
mural and think...

01:08.302 --> 01:10.502
- Grandma Phoebe has
a super-handsome brother!

01:10.504 --> 01:12.438
- They do not
sound like that.

01:12.440 --> 01:13.105
- Yeah, they do.

01:13.107 --> 01:14.706
- Okay, well,
at least my grandkids

01:14.708 --> 01:16.508
won't have a weird
bunny uncle.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.043
- Colosso's great
with kids.

01:18.045 --> 01:20.546
- Seriously? That's
what you're going with?

01:20.548 --> 01:22.347
- Yeah.
- He's a bunny.

01:22.349 --> 01:23.415
- They're fighting again.

01:23.417 --> 01:26.151
Everything
is back to normal.

01:28.489 --> 01:30.522
- ¶

01:30.524 --> 01:32.291
- Salutations, family.

01:32.293 --> 01:33.425
Ooh, breakfast.

01:33.427 --> 01:36.628
- Oh, no, pancake
protection!

01:37.965 --> 01:40.265
- You win this time,
short stack.

01:40.267 --> 01:42.668
- Ooh...
- Not mine.

01:45.005 --> 01:46.972
- Morning.

01:46.974 --> 01:47.406
Dab!

01:47.408 --> 01:49.041
- Are you still
doing that?

01:49.043 --> 01:51.110
- Short answer? Dab!

01:51.645 --> 01:53.011
Long answer?

01:53.013 --> 01:54.980
Da-a-a-a-a-b!

01:54.982 --> 01:56.281
- You have to
stop doing that.

01:56.283 --> 01:59.017
I feel like every time
we try to hang out lately

01:59.019 --> 02:01.453
all you do is--
- Dab! Dab! Dab!

02:01.455 --> 02:03.622
- Are you even
listening to me?

02:03.624 --> 02:05.657
- Cool! Pancakes!

02:05.659 --> 02:06.992
Dab!

02:06.994 --> 02:08.293
Hot maple syrup!

02:08.295 --> 02:09.461
Dab!

02:09.463 --> 02:11.029
Fork! Dab!

02:11.031 --> 02:13.031
[speed eating]

02:14.201 --> 02:16.568
Dab! Dab! Dab! Dab!

02:16.570 --> 02:19.438
- So, that
was awful, right?

02:19.440 --> 02:21.573
- I don't know.
I think it's cool.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.175
Da--
- Don't!

02:23.177 --> 02:24.776
- I have to stop
Billy somehow.

02:24.778 --> 02:26.678
- Oh, Nora, it's just
a dance fad.

02:26.680 --> 02:27.713
He'll grow out of it.

02:27.715 --> 02:29.248
Remember, most of
freshman year

02:29.250 --> 02:31.216
Phoebe couldn't stop
doing the stanky leg.

02:31.218 --> 02:34.219
- Oh, I remember
that dance.

02:34.221 --> 02:35.320
Get a whiff of this.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.389
- HANK, NORA, CHLOE:
Don't!

02:37.391 --> 02:38.724
- Seriously, if he
does it again,

02:38.726 --> 02:41.493
I'll have to give him good,
old-fashioned laser therapy.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.729
- Nora, laser therapy
is for warts

02:43.731 --> 02:44.730
and Daddy's back hair.

02:44.732 --> 02:47.733
Now leave Billy alone
and finish your breakfast.

02:47.735 --> 02:49.368
- [groans]
Fine!

02:49.370 --> 02:51.537
Hey, where's my pancake?

02:51.539 --> 02:54.339
- [garbled]
What pancake?

02:54.341 --> 02:57.242
- ¶

02:57.244 --> 02:59.044
- [whistle shrills]
- Point!

02:59.046 --> 03:03.148
The score is now 13 to
I've-wasted-my-life.

03:04.385 --> 03:05.384
Ball in.

03:05.386 --> 03:07.753
- Serving!

03:07.755 --> 03:09.154
[grunts]
- MAX: Ow!

03:09.156 --> 03:13.125
- Sorry. It's my first
time playing water polo.

03:15.629 --> 03:16.628
- Max, look,
there's Smith.

03:16.630 --> 03:19.331
She must be done
with the mural.

03:19.333 --> 03:21.099
- [bell ringing]

03:21.101 --> 03:23.168
- That's class.
You're all losers.

03:23.170 --> 03:24.670
Get out!

03:25.806 --> 03:27.539
- I really want a peek
at that painting,

03:27.541 --> 03:29.241
but I know
what you're gonna say.

03:29.243 --> 03:31.510
It's wrong and we should
wait for the unveiling.

03:31.512 --> 03:34.446
- Max, stop blabbing
and get over here.

03:34.615 --> 03:37.482
All right, without
further ado...

03:37.484 --> 03:40.185
I give you...

03:40.187 --> 03:43.088
- [dramatic music]

03:45.292 --> 03:48.360
- Max and Phoebe
attacking the prom?

03:48.362 --> 03:51.663
- She turned us into
monstrous villains.

03:51.665 --> 03:53.398
Oh!

03:53.400 --> 03:56.568
And she swooshed my hair
to the wrong side.

03:57.137 --> 03:59.438
- That's how we're gonna
be remembered--forever!

03:59.440 --> 04:00.505
- Your grandkids
are gonna be like,

04:00.507 --> 04:02.774
Max's swoosh is wrong.
You guys were never heroes.

04:02.776 --> 04:05.410
- They do not
sound like that!

04:05.412 --> 04:08.313
- ¶

04:08.315 --> 04:09.381
¶ What you see ¶

04:09.383 --> 04:10.582
¶ Is not what you get ¶

04:10.584 --> 04:14.253
¶ Livin' our lives
with a secret ¶

04:14.255 --> 04:15.721
¶ We fit right in ¶

04:15.723 --> 04:17.155
¶ Bet you never guessed ¶

04:17.157 --> 04:18.690
¶ 'Cause we're
livin' our lives ¶

04:18.692 --> 04:20.425
¶ Just like all the rest ¶

04:20.427 --> 04:22.294
¶ A picture
perfect family ¶

04:22.296 --> 04:24.196
¶ Is what we try to be ¶

04:24.198 --> 04:25.631
¶ Look closer,
you might see ¶

04:25.633 --> 04:27.232
¶ The crazy things we do ¶

04:27.234 --> 04:29.167
¶ This isn't
make believe ¶

04:29.169 --> 04:30.569
¶ It's our reality ¶

04:30.571 --> 04:31.703
¶ Just your average family ¶

04:31.705 --> 04:35.307
¶ Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble ¶

04:35.309 --> 04:39.811
¶ Livin' a double life ¶¶

04:42.716 --> 04:43.949
- ¶

04:43.951 --> 04:45.517
- PHOEBE:
Cherry, it was awful.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.119
She made us look
like the bad guys.

04:47.121 --> 04:49.454
I mean, Max is used
to being hated.

04:49.456 --> 04:51.056
But not me.

04:51.058 --> 04:53.625
- Yeah, I need to be
remembered as a hero--

04:53.627 --> 04:55.594
a gorgeous,
chiseled hero!

04:55.596 --> 04:58.730
- Maybe Smith isn't over what
you guys did to her at prom.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.465
- What did we do
to her at prom?

05:00.467 --> 05:02.734
- It was a dark
and stormy night.

05:02.736 --> 05:04.903
A young girl and her brother
were lost in the woods,

05:04.905 --> 05:08.140
and their breadcrumb trail
was nowhere to be found.

05:08.142 --> 05:10.475
- That's Handsel
and Gretel.

05:10.477 --> 05:11.176
- Are you sure?

05:11.178 --> 05:12.878
- Cherry.
- Right.

05:12.880 --> 05:16.715
Okay, it was
prom night...

05:16.717 --> 05:18.650
and you two were
fighting Dark Mayhem

05:18.652 --> 05:20.018
while we were all
hiding behind you

05:20.020 --> 05:23.121
wondering how your hair
was holding up so well.

05:23.123 --> 05:24.556
- [dramatic music]

05:24.558 --> 05:27.459
- CHERRY: Smith was over
by the punch bowl...

05:27.461 --> 05:28.460
chillaxin'.

05:28.462 --> 05:29.895
- It's the end of days!

05:29.897 --> 05:32.130
- CHERRY: One of the plasma
balls you guys deflected

05:32.132 --> 05:34.700
got an itty bitty
piece of her.

05:34.702 --> 05:35.901
- [heavy thud]
- Oh!

05:35.903 --> 05:37.936
- [table crashes]

05:38.105 --> 05:39.938
- That museum
still smells like

05:39.940 --> 05:42.474
burnt hair
and fruit punch.

05:43.077 --> 05:45.510
- Oh, no, proms are
supposed to be a dream

05:45.512 --> 05:46.845
and we made hers
a nightmare.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.780
No wonder she has
it out for us.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.782
- And I do not want
her to hate me, too,

05:50.784 --> 05:53.652
so I am outie
like my belly button.

05:55.255 --> 05:57.489
- I had no idea.
- That Cherry has an outie?

05:57.491 --> 06:00.592
It's actually more
common than you think.

06:00.594 --> 06:01.226
- No, about prom.

06:01.228 --> 06:02.928
And stop pretending
you know anything

06:02.930 --> 06:05.030
about Cherry's
outie struggle.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.065
We need to
apologize to Smith.

06:07.067 --> 06:07.899
- [scoffs]
No way.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.701
We saved everyone
that night.

06:09.703 --> 06:10.869
She should be
thanking us,

06:10.871 --> 06:12.104
not ruining our legacy.

06:12.106 --> 06:13.972
- What does it hurt
to just apologize?

06:13.974 --> 06:16.942
- Sorry, but Max Thunderman
never says sorry.

06:16.944 --> 06:19.878
- You literally
just said sorry twice.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.546
- I have my pride, Phoebe.

06:21.548 --> 06:23.682
I will not apologize.

06:24.985 --> 06:27.252
But I will tattle.

06:27.721 --> 06:28.987
Principal Bradford!

06:28.989 --> 06:32.290
¶ I have something
to tell you ¶

06:32.292 --> 06:33.191
- Spit it out, Max.

06:33.193 --> 06:36.161
I have to get to a meeting
with some angry moms--

06:36.163 --> 06:39.097
angry "single" moms.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.768
- PHOEBE & MAX:
Ew.

06:42.936 --> 06:45.203
- Look, Bradford, the girl
you got to paint our mural

06:45.205 --> 06:47.239
is making us look
like monsters.

06:47.241 --> 06:48.140
- Really?
- Yes.

06:48.142 --> 06:50.809
Which is why you have
to make her fix it.

06:50.811 --> 06:51.710
- [laughing]

06:51.712 --> 06:54.713
Which is why
this is awesome!

06:54.715 --> 06:56.581
Because of
the school board,

06:56.583 --> 06:58.717
that thing's gonna
be on the wall forever.

06:58.719 --> 07:01.286
Ooh! Hot diggity-dog!

07:01.288 --> 07:02.988
Ow! Ow!

07:02.990 --> 07:04.589
- What did we ever
do to him?

07:04.591 --> 07:05.791
- Oh, trip him
down the stairs,

07:05.793 --> 07:08.693
beat him in wrestling,
hot sauce fountain--

07:08.695 --> 07:09.828
- Okay!

07:09.830 --> 07:11.763
We should focus on
what we did to Smith.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.031
We need to apologize
and show her

07:13.033 --> 07:15.133
we're not the horrible
people she thinks we are.

07:15.135 --> 07:16.835
Oh, uh, we should
invite her

07:16.837 --> 07:18.103
to dinner at Splatburger.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.172
- I am not buying
her dinner.

07:20.174 --> 07:21.606
- Why? We'll say
we're sorry

07:21.608 --> 07:23.208
and she'll change
the mural.

07:23.210 --> 07:24.075
- Not interested.

07:24.077 --> 07:26.077
- I'm paying.
- I'm in.

07:26.079 --> 07:32.684
- ¶

07:32.686 --> 07:33.852
- Thanks for making
this movie

07:33.854 --> 07:35.187
to help Billy
stop dabbing.

07:35.189 --> 07:37.989
- I still think
Plan A was better.

07:39.726 --> 07:41.693
- [metal clanks]

07:41.695 --> 07:43.829
- COLOSSO:
[chuckling]

07:43.831 --> 07:45.030
Just so we're clear.

07:45.032 --> 07:46.665
Normally,
I wouldn't help.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.166
But I have to
make a movie

07:48.168 --> 07:49.868
for my online
film class.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.703
- You take online
film classes?

07:51.705 --> 07:53.205
I thought you were
an evil bunny.

07:53.207 --> 07:55.640
- I can be two things!

07:55.642 --> 07:56.374
Now bring Billy down,

07:56.376 --> 08:00.679
so I can set his
happiness on fire.

08:00.681 --> 08:03.014
- Billy!
- [zooming]

08:03.016 --> 08:06.885
Dab! Dab! Dab!
[laughing]

08:06.887 --> 08:09.888
- We must destroy him.

08:09.890 --> 08:10.655
- What's up, guys?

08:10.657 --> 08:12.190
- Uh, Dr. Colosso
and I found this video

08:12.192 --> 08:13.625
that I really think
you should watch.

08:13.627 --> 08:16.294
- Is it the one with the shark
trying to eat the submarine?

08:16.296 --> 08:19.064
Come on, shark,
it's a submarine.

08:19.066 --> 08:21.066
- The video's
about dabbing.

08:21.068 --> 08:24.236
- Cool! A video
about dabbing? Dab!

08:24.238 --> 08:27.639
A random bear
trap? Dab!

08:27.641 --> 08:29.741
- Just watch the video.

08:29.743 --> 08:31.309
- It's show time.

08:31.311 --> 08:33.211
- [lively music]

08:33.213 --> 08:36.248
- [mock German accent]
Gooden day und velcome.

08:36.250 --> 08:40.352
Trust me when I tell you
that dabbing is dangerous.

08:40.354 --> 08:44.289
Just look what dabbing
did to these poor kids.

08:47.194 --> 08:48.126
See?

08:48.128 --> 08:51.963
Und if zat's not enough,
listen to zis sad story.

08:51.965 --> 08:54.866
- [sad violin music]
- I loved dabbing.

08:54.868 --> 08:55.834
I dabbed everywhere--

08:55.836 --> 08:58.770
schools, weddings,
dog shows.

08:58.772 --> 09:00.105
I didn't care.

09:00.107 --> 09:02.407
Then my sister stopped
talking to me.

09:02.409 --> 09:05.143
If I could take back
all those dabs

09:05.145 --> 09:07.379
just to get her to
hang out with me again,

09:07.381 --> 09:10.982
I would.
- [sad violin music]

09:10.984 --> 09:12.984
- Remember, kids,
don't dab,

09:12.986 --> 09:16.721
or you'll just be dabbing
the tears from your eyes.

09:16.723 --> 09:19.891
- [sad violin music]

09:21.261 --> 09:23.328
- I'll never dab again!

09:24.298 --> 09:26.064
- No, you won't.
[patting back]

09:26.066 --> 09:28.400
No, you won't.

09:29.369 --> 09:32.871
- ¶

09:32.873 --> 09:35.941
- So, Smith. Huh.
That's a cool name.

09:35.943 --> 09:38.810
Is it a first name,
last name, nickname?

09:38.812 --> 09:40.111
- Yes.

09:40.113 --> 09:41.413
- Well, thanks for coming.

09:41.415 --> 09:43.715
You know, we always see you
around the halls and stuff,

09:43.717 --> 09:45.984
but it's nice to just
hang out and talk, one-on-one.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.185
- MAX: [clears throat]
- On one.

09:47.187 --> 09:51.923
Anyway, um, I brought
you a little something.

09:51.925 --> 09:56.795
- Whoa! These brushes
are really expensive.

09:56.797 --> 09:57.429
[sniffing]

09:57.431 --> 10:00.165
Real Canadian
squirrel hair.

10:01.134 --> 10:02.901
- Spending three
months' allowance

10:02.903 --> 10:05.437
on someone I barely
know is what I do.

10:05.439 --> 10:07.172
- That's weirdly nice.

10:07.174 --> 10:10.175
- Oh, and, uh,
a little birdie told me

10:10.177 --> 10:14.079
your fave shake
is choco-strawberry.

10:14.081 --> 10:14.546
- It is.

10:14.548 --> 10:16.314
- It's brown and swirly
like my eyes.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.249
Try not to get
lost in them.

10:18.251 --> 10:20.285
There's no way back.

10:21.221 --> 10:21.920
- [sighs]

10:21.922 --> 10:23.822
You guys are being
really nice to me,

10:23.824 --> 10:24.823
but I have to ask--

10:24.825 --> 10:26.424
are you just
pretending to like me

10:26.426 --> 10:27.926
because I'm painting
the mural?

10:27.928 --> 10:30.328
- What?! Are you
painting that thing?

10:30.330 --> 10:33.965
I just forgot.
- I did, too.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.767
- Um, no, actually
we just found out

10:35.769 --> 10:37.936
what happened to
you at the prom,

10:37.938 --> 10:39.771
and it was not cool.

10:39.773 --> 10:40.939
- Not cool?

10:40.941 --> 10:43.008
A demon threw
fire at me!

10:43.010 --> 10:45.977
I'd been waiting all year
for Jimmy to ask me out.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.946
It was supposed to
be my first dance,

10:47.948 --> 10:50.482
not my first
dance with death!

10:50.484 --> 10:52.417
- Look, when I was
a superhero,

10:52.419 --> 10:54.819
I always tried to
do the right thing,

10:54.821 --> 10:55.553
but from time to time,

10:55.555 --> 10:57.355
good people got hurt
in the process.

10:57.357 --> 10:59.557
Sometimes you've gotta
break a few eggs

10:59.559 --> 11:00.825
to save a prom.

11:00.827 --> 11:03.928
- Eggs make me throw up.
- Okay.

11:03.930 --> 11:06.931
My point is I'm sorry.

11:06.933 --> 11:08.800
We're sorry.

11:08.802 --> 11:14.873
- Yeah, we're very sporry
and we capologize.

11:14.875 --> 11:17.442
That's the best
you're gonna get.

11:17.611 --> 11:21.212
- I used to think you were
both horrible people, but...

11:21.214 --> 11:23.314
I guess I was wrong
about you.

11:23.316 --> 11:24.149
- Don't feel bad.

11:24.151 --> 11:26.017
Just go back
and change the painting

11:26.019 --> 11:28.186
so we don't look
like prom goblins.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.587
- You did see my mural!

11:29.589 --> 11:34.325
- Max, did you
look at the mural?

11:34.327 --> 11:37.395
Okay, fine, we did
look at it.

11:37.397 --> 11:38.163
But, in our defense,

11:38.165 --> 11:42.434
you totally caught us
and now we're frightened.

11:42.436 --> 11:43.568
- You are horrible.

11:43.570 --> 11:47.138
You're liars, connivers,
and straight up toilet people!

11:47.140 --> 11:50.175
- Smith, I know we went
about this the wrong way,

11:50.177 --> 11:52.977
but, please, give us one more
chance to fix everything.

11:52.979 --> 11:55.346
- You can't fix this!

11:55.348 --> 12:00.285
That plasma ball turned me
into a human tumbleweed.

12:00.287 --> 12:02.020
- That is...

12:02.022 --> 12:05.223
Really? It's
always like that?

12:05.225 --> 12:08.159
- I kinda wanna touch it.

12:09.162 --> 12:11.262
- There has to be
something we can do here.

12:11.264 --> 12:12.430
Please don't let
that awful mural

12:12.432 --> 12:14.566
haunt us till
the end of time.

12:14.568 --> 12:16.901
- Okay, I'll change
my mural.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.203
- You will? Oh, great.

12:18.205 --> 12:19.537
- On one condition.

12:19.539 --> 12:21.139
- Spoke too soon.

12:21.141 --> 12:23.208
- You have to suffer
the same pain

12:23.210 --> 12:25.944
and humiliation
that I did.

12:25.946 --> 12:29.614
- Don't worry, I'll get
her lost in my eyes.

12:33.453 --> 12:36.354
It's not working.
We're in trouble, Phoebe.

12:40.794 --> 12:42.427
- ¶

12:42.429 --> 12:44.362
- Wonder what Smith's
got planned for us.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.431
- Maybe she'll show us
mercy after I give her

12:46.433 --> 12:49.534
this gift basket
of all-natural conditioners.

12:49.536 --> 12:50.235
- Good idea.

12:50.237 --> 12:53.371
Hey, wait, that is
my healthy hair basket.

12:53.373 --> 12:56.341
- She needs it
more than you.

12:56.343 --> 12:57.776
Hopefully, it'll only be
a few minutes of humiliation

12:57.778 --> 13:01.179
and then she'll repaint us to
look like the heroes we are.

13:01.181 --> 13:03.448
- Maybe she'll feed
you candy and cookies

13:03.450 --> 13:06.284
and then try to throw
you in her oven.

13:06.820 --> 13:10.555
- Again, Cherry,
that's Hansel and Gretel.

13:10.557 --> 13:11.723
- Are you sure?

13:11.725 --> 13:13.158
- Cherry.
- Right.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.559
I'll see you guys later.

13:14.561 --> 13:17.729
- [bell rings]

13:17.731 --> 13:18.630
- I got you something.

13:18.632 --> 13:21.566
- [laughs] You have to wear
the same dress as Smith.

13:21.568 --> 13:23.368
- Oh, no, the second
dress is for you.

13:23.370 --> 13:26.905
- [laughs] You have to wear
the same dress as me.

13:28.441 --> 13:29.507
- Now go get changed.

13:29.509 --> 13:32.510
You don't wanna
be late for prom.

13:32.512 --> 13:34.746
- Prom? What prom?

13:34.748 --> 13:37.749
- This prom!

13:37.751 --> 13:38.817
- STUDENTS:
[laughing]

13:38.819 --> 13:41.719
- I'm sorry, but this is why
I never say I'm sorry.

13:41.721 --> 13:43.588
- You keep sayin' it.

13:43.590 --> 13:49.360
- ¶

13:49.362 --> 13:51.296
- NORA:
[humming]

13:51.298 --> 13:53.464
- You seem very
happy, Nora.

13:53.466 --> 13:56.868
- I'm feeling
pretty good about myself.

13:56.870 --> 13:59.704
- [laughing]
Hello, family.

13:59.706 --> 14:02.907
- Hey, hey, hey, hey,
lookin' good, son.

14:05.178 --> 14:08.213
- What is happening
right now?

14:08.215 --> 14:10.615
- Billy looks
like Daddy.

14:10.617 --> 14:13.852
- That's right, Chloe.
I'm not dabbing anymore.

14:13.854 --> 14:15.253
I've started a new craze

14:15.255 --> 14:18.857
that's even cooler
called "dadding."

14:19.926 --> 14:24.429
- Dadding? Why?
And what? And why?

14:24.431 --> 14:25.296
- Hey, big guy,

14:25.298 --> 14:27.966
thanks for letting me
borrow your loafers.

14:27.968 --> 14:30.468
- "Shoe" got it.

14:30.470 --> 14:33.238
- Shoe? Great dad joke.

14:33.240 --> 14:36.975
- BILLY & HANK:
[laughing]

14:36.977 --> 14:40.445
- Oh, no, they both
think that was funny.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.247
- [sighs]
Come on, Billy.

14:42.249 --> 14:43.548
Oh, hey, let's go
to Splatburger

14:43.550 --> 14:45.617
and make fun
of Mrs. Wong.

14:45.619 --> 14:48.286
- Now, Nora...

14:48.288 --> 14:50.989
I did not raise you
to make fun of people.

14:50.991 --> 14:54.325
How about we go watch
the news together?

14:54.327 --> 14:55.894
- I have some news--

14:55.896 --> 14:57.795
you broke Billy!

14:59.566 --> 15:01.566
- I know, but maybe
I can fix him.

15:01.568 --> 15:04.369
Oh, are you up for
a popcorn party?

15:07.007 --> 15:09.674
- [lasers zapping,
popcorn popping]

15:10.944 --> 15:12.844
- Laser corn!

15:14.848 --> 15:15.813
- Pretty cool, huh?

15:15.815 --> 15:18.016
If you want, you can
dab while you eat.

15:18.018 --> 15:20.685
- Nora, I don't do
that anymore.

15:20.687 --> 15:23.521
Now clean up
this popcorn.

15:23.523 --> 15:25.323
"Pop" to it!

15:25.325 --> 15:29.961
- HANK & BILLY:
[laughing]

15:29.963 --> 15:34.432
- [music with a beat]

15:34.434 --> 15:35.133
- This is terrible.

15:35.135 --> 15:37.969
I guess we're just
stuck with the mural.

15:37.971 --> 15:39.003
- The only good part is

15:39.005 --> 15:41.706
this dress really shows
off my man stilts.

15:41.708 --> 15:44.442
- This is the part
where I danced alone

15:44.444 --> 15:46.411
because my date
never arrived.

15:46.413 --> 15:48.046
- How is it our fault
that your date bailed?

15:48.048 --> 15:52.317
- His car was crushed by
Dark Mayhem's helicopter.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.652
- Okay, yeah,
that's on us.

15:54.654 --> 15:56.754
- What is this?

15:56.756 --> 15:58.489
You call that dancing?

15:58.491 --> 16:02.393
Come on,
feel the music!

16:02.395 --> 16:11.069
- ¶

16:11.071 --> 16:13.438
- Woo!
[laughing]

16:13.440 --> 16:15.606
Yeah! Encore! Encore!

16:15.608 --> 16:18.476
- Okay, Smith,
we did what you asked.

16:18.478 --> 16:19.877
Now you can
change the mural.

16:19.879 --> 16:21.346
- Prom isn't over yet.

16:21.348 --> 16:22.213
You're about
to experience

16:22.215 --> 16:25.583
the moment that
ruined my life.

16:25.585 --> 16:28.786
Get ready to get wet!

16:30.490 --> 16:31.756
- I was on prom committee

16:31.758 --> 16:34.492
and I distinctly do not
remember a kiddie pool.

16:34.494 --> 16:37.795
- It symbolizes
the punch bowl I fell into.

16:37.797 --> 16:42.834
Symbols! Art!
Open a book!

16:44.738 --> 16:47.005
- No. No.
- [channel surfing]

16:47.007 --> 16:49.374
- Ooh, a plumbing
documentary--

16:49.376 --> 16:51.075
"Who Let the Clogs Out?"

16:51.077 --> 16:53.044
- [water swishing]

16:53.046 --> 16:53.978
- Just so you know,

16:53.980 --> 16:56.381
if this plan doesn't
get him dabbing again,

16:56.383 --> 16:58.116
I'm still keeping
the outfit.

16:58.118 --> 17:00.018
- You should let me
dress you more often,

17:00.020 --> 17:03.087
because normally you
look pretty stupid.

17:04.057 --> 17:08.092
- Oh, no, now he's ordering
useless products off the TV.

17:08.094 --> 17:11.396
- I love to deep-fry
20 pound hams.

17:11.398 --> 17:13.598
I'll take two!

17:14.567 --> 17:15.433
- Ugh!

17:15.435 --> 17:17.668
Last thing I need's
another Hank.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.670
Let's bust a move.

17:19.672 --> 17:22.073
- Yo, Billy!

17:22.075 --> 17:24.542
Good luck not dabbing.

17:24.544 --> 17:28.012
- Dr. Colosso,
<i> muy fuego</i> .

17:28.014 --> 17:29.847
¶ Get up,
get ready to dance ¶

17:29.849 --> 17:31.916
¶ Fly by the seat
of your pants ¶

17:31.918 --> 17:33.851
¶ Bob your neck,
bend your elbow ¶

17:33.853 --> 17:36.054
¶ It's time to dance,
ready, set go ¶

17:36.056 --> 17:38.389
¶ Dab dab dab dab ¶

17:38.391 --> 17:40.091
¶ Dab dab dab dab ¶

17:40.093 --> 17:41.793
¶ Dab dab dab dab ¶

17:41.795 --> 17:43.861
- I'd love to dab,
but I can't.

17:43.863 --> 17:47.031
- [music stops]
- ¶ Dab dab dab dab da-- ¶

17:47.033 --> 17:47.965
What happened?

17:47.967 --> 17:49.834
Turn up my snare!

17:49.836 --> 17:51.869
- That song was fire.
Why aren't you dabbing?

17:51.871 --> 17:54.405
- Because I don't wanna be
like that kid in your video.

17:54.407 --> 17:57.008
He doesn't even talk
to his sister anymore.

17:57.877 --> 17:59.977
- Billy, that video
you watched...

17:59.979 --> 18:01.045
it was fake.

18:01.047 --> 18:02.613
Dr. Colosso made it.

18:02.615 --> 18:05.750
- I knew Dr. Macaroni
looked familiar.

18:05.752 --> 18:09.120
Your German accent's
really good, Nora.

18:09.122 --> 18:12.123
- Look, you might annoy
me from time to time,

18:12.125 --> 18:15.059
but I'll always
be your sister.

18:15.061 --> 18:16.627
- Thanks, Nora.

18:16.629 --> 18:17.795
- Blecch!

18:17.797 --> 18:19.564
Bluuuhhh!

18:19.566 --> 18:20.064
[coughs]

18:20.066 --> 18:22.900
Your tender moment's
makin' me sick.

18:22.902 --> 18:24.569
[coughs, sputters]

18:24.571 --> 18:29.173
- Are you two ready to suffer
the ultimate humiliation?

18:29.175 --> 18:30.508
- Now I'm confused.

18:30.510 --> 18:32.910
When do we throw those
water balloons at you?

18:32.912 --> 18:35.746
- They're paint balloons
and I throw them at you.

18:35.748 --> 18:38.916
It's like this is
your first revenge prom.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.618
- Hold on. How many
humiliating things

18:40.620 --> 18:42.920
are we talking about
before we're even?

18:42.922 --> 18:46.624
- It was a long
and terrible night, Phoebe--

18:46.626 --> 18:49.127
the rain,
the bicycle accident,

18:49.129 --> 18:52.897
the bus ride home when
that chicken bit me.

18:52.899 --> 18:54.765
- Max, she's never
gonna be satisfied

18:54.767 --> 18:56.734
no matter how much
we let her humiliate us.

18:56.736 --> 18:58.669
- Yeah, and the joke's
on her, anyway.

18:58.671 --> 19:00.538
I am lovin' these shoes.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.507
They're oddly
comfortable.

19:02.509 --> 19:05.109
- We're doing all this so we'll
be remembered as heroes,

19:05.111 --> 19:07.078
but we know
we're heroes.

19:07.080 --> 19:07.979
We help people
every day.

19:07.981 --> 19:11.182
What's on that mural
isn't gonna change that.

19:11.184 --> 19:12.517
Come on.

19:12.519 --> 19:14.585
Hey, Smith,
we're done here.

19:14.587 --> 19:16.754
- Yeah, we already
capologized,

19:16.756 --> 19:20.691
so if that's not good
enough, that's on you.

19:20.693 --> 19:21.926
- It's not enough.

19:21.928 --> 19:25.062
I spent six hours filling
these balloons with paint

19:25.064 --> 19:27.198
and I'm feelin' throwy.

19:27.200 --> 19:31.702
Unless you're cool with
everyone seeing that mural?

19:31.704 --> 19:32.703
- We're cool with it.

19:32.705 --> 19:35.139
In fact, we're gonna
show it to them.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.543
- Uh, we are?
- Yes, we just agreed on it,

19:38.545 --> 19:40.912
but you were too busy
enjoying your lady shoes.

19:40.914 --> 19:43.014
- It's just that they
look like a dressy shoe,

19:43.016 --> 19:45.550
but feel like
a sneaker!

19:46.553 --> 19:47.852
- [sighs]
Hey, uh...

19:47.854 --> 19:49.754
six period gym class?

19:49.756 --> 19:50.955
Time to unveil our mural.

19:50.957 --> 19:53.224
- Yeah, but, before
we show it to you,

19:53.226 --> 19:57.528
lady amazers, activate!
Oosh! Oosh!

19:57.530 --> 19:59.664
- Just help me pull this.

20:02.936 --> 20:06.704
- STUDENTS:
[murmuring]

20:06.706 --> 20:10.241
- [laughing]
Sweet revenge!

20:10.243 --> 20:11.876
- They're not laughing.

20:11.878 --> 20:14.011
I think they
think it's...

20:14.013 --> 20:15.947
- Kind of cool?

20:18.651 --> 20:19.717
I was so worried
about my legacy

20:19.719 --> 20:23.988
that I didn't notice this
thing is kinda epic.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.823
- Yeah, and I could use
hands like that.

20:25.825 --> 20:28.125
Colosso'd finally stop
asking me for tummy tickles.

20:28.127 --> 20:29.660
- PHOEBE:
[laughing]

20:29.662 --> 20:30.861
- Stop liking it!

20:30.863 --> 20:32.163
- I'm sorry,
this thing is amazing.

20:32.165 --> 20:33.598
Come on, look at
that girl.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.199
She's all, ahhh,
stop chasing me.

20:35.201 --> 20:37.635
And I'm all,
no, I'm not gonna.

20:37.971 --> 20:39.770
- SMITH:
[angry growl]

20:39.772 --> 20:42.173
- Uh, Phoebe, is she
still mad for some reason?

20:42.175 --> 20:43.941
- Aaaahhhh!

20:43.943 --> 20:44.976
- [paint splats]

20:44.978 --> 20:46.611
[paint splats]

20:46.613 --> 20:49.714
- Ahhhh!
- [paint splats]

20:49.716 --> 20:52.216
- Ahhhhh!
- [paint splats]

20:52.218 --> 20:56.187
- Oh, you can relax, Max.
She's outta balloons.

20:56.189 --> 20:56.921
- SMITH:
[panting]

20:56.923 --> 20:59.023
- But now she's doin' that.
- Uh-oh!

20:59.025 --> 21:03.060
- [slow motion roaring]

21:06.699 --> 21:08.866
Whoa!

21:08.868 --> 21:10.668
Ah!

21:10.670 --> 21:12.970
- STUDENTS:
[applauding]

21:14.374 --> 21:15.373
- You saved me?

21:15.375 --> 21:16.807
After everything I did?

21:16.809 --> 21:18.809
- Yeah, you were
in trouble.

21:18.811 --> 21:19.944
- Thank you.

21:19.946 --> 21:21.045
- You can thank me

21:21.047 --> 21:23.948
by telling me
where you got these shoes.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.151
- Consider them yours.

21:27.153 --> 21:29.820
- Best revenge prom ever!

21:29.822 --> 21:31.722
- Uh, since you're
feeling so generous,

21:31.724 --> 21:34.925
think I could get those Canadian
squirrel brushes back?

21:34.927 --> 21:35.960
- No, sorry.

21:35.962 --> 21:39.630
I'm gonna need them
when I redo the mural.

21:39.632 --> 21:40.364
- Awww...

21:40.366 --> 21:45.202
I mean, you could use your
old brushes, but, hey...

21:45.204 --> 21:45.836
- [groans]

21:45.838 --> 21:48.372
Okay, this was fun when
you hated each other.

21:48.374 --> 21:50.775
But if you're gonna be
all nicey, nicey, nicey,

21:50.777 --> 21:53.177
then I want you
to clean the--

21:53.179 --> 21:55.246
Ahhhhh!

21:55.248 --> 21:56.681
[sputtering]

21:56.683 --> 21:59.283
Oh, the sugar's
burning my eyes!

21:59.285 --> 22:00.985
Ahhhh!

22:00.987 --> 22:03.821
- Well, you can't
save everybody.

22:03.823 --> 22:06.657
- PRINCIPAL BRADFORD:
Ahhhhh!

22:06.659 --> 22:09.026
[sputtering]

22:12.231 --> 22:24.475
- ¶
