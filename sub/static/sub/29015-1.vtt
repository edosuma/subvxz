WEBVTT

01:59.620 --> 02:01.264
Run, <i>cabr√≥n,</i>
some shit's gone down, eh.

02:01.288 --> 02:02.870
I know,
are they chasing us?

02:02.956 --> 02:04.225
You don't wanna
scam the Cortezes.

02:04.249 --> 02:06.582
- Fucker...
- Watch out, watch out.

02:07.294 --> 02:08.751
Watch out.

02:09.713 --> 02:11.750
Three <i>amigos,</i> huh?

02:11.840 --> 02:13.706
What are you <i>chavalos</i>
doing out so late?

02:17.429 --> 02:21.423
In the <i>barrio,</i> bad things happen
when the sky turns black.

02:36.948 --> 02:38.029
Hey!

02:38.241 --> 02:40.904
Let's go steal some <i>bironga</i>
off your old man and get fucked up?

02:40.994 --> 02:42.847
- Let's go hang with them <i>vatos!</i>
- No, I gotta go.

02:42.871 --> 02:45.158
My mom's gonna whup my ass.
Talk to you later, aye.

02:54.508 --> 02:57.251
Jose! Where you been?
Where you been?

02:57.344 --> 02:58.835
Get the fuck inside.

03:05.644 --> 03:07.135
Take it
to the back, homie.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.272
Fuck. Somebody just
got shot up, eh?

03:13.110 --> 03:18.071
Jose, how many fucking times
have I told you to respect me?

03:18.156 --> 03:21.320
I've told you to stop
fucking with me...

03:27.082 --> 03:28.948
Shit always rolls
down the hill, homie.

03:30.419 --> 03:32.081
Even in the hood.

03:40.512 --> 03:41.798
<i>La jura.</i>

03:43.432 --> 03:45.890
I got my own
spotlight tonight, huh?

03:45.976 --> 03:48.764
How does it feel to be
the star of the show, Emilio?

03:49.020 --> 03:51.637
Only my <i>abuela</i>
calls me Emilio...

03:51.732 --> 03:52.893
To you, it's Shadow.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.311
You come back
to break my other leg?

04:00.282 --> 04:02.490
Two police officers were ambushed
and shot tonight.

04:02.576 --> 04:05.614
Both are in the ICU.
You know anything about that?

04:06.830 --> 04:10.369
I'm just a peace-loving
law-abiding citizen, <i>ese.</i>

04:19.551 --> 04:22.259
You get into my shit,
<i>ese,</i> is that it?

04:25.307 --> 04:27.799
- Fucking <i>placas.</i>
- Tsk. Shut up.

04:27.934 --> 04:29.787
Notice that both stop signs
on the end of the block

04:29.811 --> 04:30.892
have been sawed down.

04:32.814 --> 04:34.305
You know
how that happened?

04:38.779 --> 04:42.864
El Chicano,
the ghetto grim reaper,

04:43.408 --> 04:46.572
leaves a mark as a warning
to the evil that lives on that block.

04:50.874 --> 04:52.866
Do you know any evil
that lives here, Emilio?

04:59.257 --> 05:00.943
Well, you guys have
a good rest of the evening.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.503
No drinking
and driving, okay?

05:02.594 --> 05:04.051
Enjoy the rest
of your night.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.617
Lock those wheels.
It's downhill, bro.

05:10.060 --> 05:11.596
Fuck that.

05:11.686 --> 05:13.097
Fuck the <i>jura.</i>

05:18.735 --> 05:21.148
- Fuck you!
- Get the fuck out of here.

05:21.238 --> 05:22.820
Fuck you.

05:22.906 --> 05:24.272
Settle down.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.112
And you, motherfucker.

05:27.202 --> 05:29.489
Walk hard in my <i>barrio?</i>

05:30.080 --> 05:32.447
I'll steal your
motherfucking soul, punk!

05:55.564 --> 05:57.396
He cuts their hearts
like the Aztecs

05:57.482 --> 05:59.940
and chops up criminals
for blood sacrifice.

06:00.527 --> 06:02.143
He can't be killed.

06:02.237 --> 06:03.944
He's the boogie man.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.316
He's a cucuy.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.278
Where you at, Chicano?

06:08.368 --> 06:10.030
Let me see your face,
motherfucker.

06:46.698 --> 06:49.156
You fucked with
the wrong <i>vato, ese!</i>

06:50.785 --> 06:52.117
You're gonna die for this.

07:31.201 --> 07:32.237
Pedro!

07:35.330 --> 07:36.446
Pedro!

07:37.749 --> 07:38.774
Pedro, wait!

07:38.875 --> 07:40.741
Diego, stop.

07:40.835 --> 07:42.201
Diego, stop, man. Stop!

07:42.295 --> 07:43.411
Hey!

07:43.546 --> 07:45.458
Stop chasing
that asshole. Hey!

07:45.548 --> 07:47.610
Yo, that's just some crackhead,
took off in the scrum.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.296
- You with me?
- Yeah.

07:49.386 --> 07:50.672
Hey, we got Silent.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.303
Come on.

07:54.683 --> 07:56.845
Man, I've seen
a lot of fucked-up shit.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.684
I've never seen
anything like this.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.123
These guys, they hosed down
the friggin' crime scene.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.639
There's no blood.
It's a war zone.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.731
Jesus Christ.
Where's Silent?

08:07.821 --> 08:09.357
We got him
in the back room.

08:10.407 --> 08:11.773
How about the cap?
He on his way?

08:11.866 --> 08:13.607
Yeah, Gomez
is rollin' up now.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.367
Hey, you two,
stay off the radio, okay?

08:18.456 --> 08:20.413
Make sure they don't
talk to Dispatch.

08:21.292 --> 08:22.703
Fucking hot in here.

08:23.044 --> 08:24.751
Good to go.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.670
Look at that.
Look at this motherfucker.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.838
Double tap.

08:31.970 --> 08:34.090
This motherfucker came across
the desk last week, man.

08:34.139 --> 08:36.381
Double tap.
This is a big piece of work.

08:36.474 --> 08:38.966
Whoever did this, you know,
they've done this before.

08:39.059 --> 08:40.426
This is
a professional hit.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.727
Talk to me.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.710
Well, based on the fact
that we got Silent back there

08:45.734 --> 08:47.441
and I know half
these fucking <i>vatos.</i>

08:47.527 --> 08:49.359
These are all
Shotgun's peeps.

08:49.612 --> 08:51.604
Maybe most
of the <i>cliqua.</i>

08:51.865 --> 08:54.778
The upper-tier <i>vatos</i> at least,
all double-tapped,

08:54.868 --> 08:56.846
all less than a quarter of
an inch between the wounds.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.486
- Pros.
- Major.

08:58.580 --> 09:02.164
- Any drugs?
- No, nothing yet.

09:09.007 --> 09:10.589
Okay, here's what we got.

09:10.675 --> 09:12.486
The FBI, they're gonna be
breathing down our backs.

09:12.510 --> 09:14.217
DEA, the ATF...

09:14.512 --> 09:16.115
But I'll be fucked
if I'm gonna let a red ball

09:16.139 --> 09:18.256
like this go federal.
Not in my backyard.

09:18.349 --> 09:20.349
Murder cases this size,
they're career makers, son.

09:20.435 --> 09:21.551
Do you understand that?

09:21.644 --> 09:22.884
How long can you
stall them out?

09:22.937 --> 09:25.395
Twenty-four hours, max.
Then the dam bursts.

09:25.482 --> 09:26.563
Where's Silent?

09:26.649 --> 09:28.060
We're holding him
in the back.

09:28.151 --> 09:29.733
Get up his ass, okay?
Get answers.

09:29.819 --> 09:31.776
Do not let him
utter the word "lawyer."

09:31.863 --> 09:32.863
Yes, sir.

09:32.989 --> 09:35.801
You're my best investigator, Diego.
You clear this case, we're getting snapped

09:35.825 --> 09:37.612
with the mayor
on the steps of city hall.

09:37.702 --> 09:39.989
- Fucking caviar, kid.
- I got it.

09:41.748 --> 09:42.784
Chatting up a storm?

09:42.874 --> 09:44.331
Staying true
to his street name.

09:44.417 --> 09:47.706
- Not a peep. Martinez.
- Morales.

09:51.883 --> 09:53.683
I heard
you're being a Chatty Cathy.

09:55.678 --> 09:57.135
Relax, Silent.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.844
We're not
going anywhere.

10:03.061 --> 10:04.497
You know if I didn't see all
the bullet holes

10:04.521 --> 10:06.207
in your homeboys out there,
I'd swear fucking Freddy Krueger

10:06.231 --> 10:07.893
had a go at you, homes.

10:10.485 --> 10:12.943
Your <i>cliqua</i> got cut up
by some serious cats, Silent.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.107
Some killers.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.636
So far, we haven't turned up
an ounce of powder,

10:18.660 --> 10:21.368
dope, meth, <i>nada.</i>

10:23.665 --> 10:27.830
Thinking I see a meeting?
Maybe a secret one.

10:27.919 --> 10:32.038
What I don't see is Shotgun
lying dead out there.

10:34.509 --> 10:37.047
I'mma show you
somethin'.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.110
Then I want you
to take your ass out there

10:39.139 --> 10:40.550
and go check out
the homeboys,

10:41.099 --> 10:42.510
and then you're gonna
understand.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.096
Understand what?

11:03.913 --> 11:05.745
Hey, man, you good?

11:11.254 --> 11:13.166
Hold up. Stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop.

11:18.928 --> 11:20.635
Don't zip that up,
don't zip that up.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.516
What the fuck?

11:41.117 --> 11:43.095
- What the hell's going on, man?
- The fuck is that, Silent?

11:43.119 --> 11:44.576
Quit fucking
bullshitting me!

11:44.662 --> 11:46.119
Why are you all
inked up like that?

11:46.206 --> 11:47.572
Detective!

11:48.416 --> 11:49.497
Outside.

11:58.301 --> 12:01.214
Boss, Silent has
a tattoo on his forearm.

12:01.304 --> 12:03.341
"Mito 9-9-86."

12:03.431 --> 12:05.969
Those dead <i>vatos</i> have
matching tattoos.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.641
"Mito" means "myth."
What's the date?

12:07.727 --> 12:09.889
My brother's birthday,

12:09.979 --> 12:11.265
which is also my birthday.

12:11.648 --> 12:13.355
"Mito" was
Pedro's nickname.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.440
- Jesus Salas. You know Jesus?
- I know Jesus.

12:15.526 --> 12:17.313
He gave it to him
when he was a kid.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.486
Pedro was into Aztec and Mayan shit.
All the legends.

12:19.572 --> 12:20.904
So Jesus
called him "Myth."

12:21.449 --> 12:23.031
Pedro did
a seven-year bid in Corcoran

12:23.117 --> 12:24.178
for possession
and trafficking.

12:24.202 --> 12:25.429
- I don't need his rap sheet.
- No, no, no.

12:25.453 --> 12:26.739
He was born
with the thug gene.

12:26.829 --> 12:28.365
All that <i>barrio</i> shit,
I wasn't.

12:28.456 --> 12:30.914
I don't like family connections
to major crimes, Diego.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.413
We were barely brothers, boss.
Okay?

12:33.503 --> 12:36.416
I stopped knowing anything
about his life a long time ago.

12:36.506 --> 12:39.795
Well, if they're Shotgun's <i>cliqua,</i> then
what are all those <i>vatos</i> doing inked up

12:39.884 --> 12:42.752
with your brother's nickname
and date of birth, like some cult?

12:44.973 --> 12:46.589
I don't know.

12:46.683 --> 12:49.346
But I have the feeling
it's linked to something bigger.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.351
It has to be.

12:52.188 --> 12:54.680
Diego, if your brother
is really connected to this,

12:54.774 --> 12:56.982
indirectly, peripherally,

12:57.318 --> 12:59.546
Martinez has got to pick up the slack
and take over the case.

12:59.570 --> 13:00.731
No. Come on, Cap!

13:00.863 --> 13:02.466
We're barely two months
into this partnership.

13:02.490 --> 13:05.858
Plus, he's Chi-Town, man.
Midwestern Mexican.

13:07.537 --> 13:09.119
This is East Los.

13:09.205 --> 13:11.948
He doesn't know these streets
or these players like I do.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.287
Let me fucking
figure it out.

13:14.377 --> 13:15.663
<i>Por favor.</i>

13:20.591 --> 13:23.425
All right,
take Silent to Whittier.

13:23.511 --> 13:25.239
Spend a little quality time
with that shithead

13:25.263 --> 13:27.255
before the Feds
storm the castle.

13:33.980 --> 13:35.061
You need an escort?

13:35.523 --> 13:36.730
I don't want
the lights.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.024
I wanna get him
to Whittier on the DL.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.233
<i>Cuidate.</i>

13:41.112 --> 13:42.819
He's all yours.

13:44.115 --> 13:47.904
Buddy, did you call me
a Midwestern Mexican?

13:48.453 --> 13:50.160
You heard that?

13:50.663 --> 13:52.245
What? Illinois
is in the Midwest.

13:52.415 --> 13:55.227
Yeah, you know, it sounded kind of shitty,
like I can't hang or something.

13:55.251 --> 13:56.992
Bro, don't take things
so personally.

13:57.211 --> 13:59.732
Anyway, that was a private conversation
that I don't feel I have to account for.

13:59.756 --> 14:01.247
I just wanna know
where I stand.

14:02.008 --> 14:03.374
You're my partner. Okay?

14:03.468 --> 14:04.737
I have your back,
and I hope you have mine.

14:04.761 --> 14:06.780
That goes without saying.
Of course I got your fucking back.

14:06.804 --> 14:08.386
I'm saying it anyway.

14:11.768 --> 14:14.010
Glad we nipped
that in the bud.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.891
Hey, homie...
<i>Hablame...</i>

14:22.320 --> 14:24.653
What are those tattoos
supposed to tell me?

14:25.073 --> 14:26.689
Your brother.

14:26.949 --> 14:28.815
He knew this was coming, man.
He warned us.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.367
That what was coming?

14:31.579 --> 14:32.945
Revolution.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.656
What the fuck are you talking
about, man?

14:37.668 --> 14:39.500
Come on, man, talk to me.
This is it.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.879
Was the <i>cliqua</i> meeting
in secret?

14:44.550 --> 14:46.041
Was Shotgun there?

14:48.179 --> 14:49.795
Shotgun wasn't there.

14:50.306 --> 14:51.672
So you were
meeting without him.

14:54.811 --> 14:56.302
Shotgun hit his own squad.

14:56.813 --> 14:57.813
Hey.

14:58.439 --> 15:01.352
We were never part of Shotgun's
<i>cliqua,</i> all right, <i>ese?</i>

15:08.616 --> 15:11.199
Silent, someone
went in on you, hard.

15:12.829 --> 15:15.742
Who and why?

15:16.582 --> 15:18.369
I'mma tell you somethin'.

15:19.377 --> 15:23.462
Your brother didn't commit suicide,
he was murdered.

15:26.175 --> 15:28.255
As a matter of fact, he was leading...

15:28.553 --> 15:29.553
Fuck!

15:29.637 --> 15:31.378
Fuck! What the fuck?

15:36.936 --> 15:39.223
Shooter, where's the shooter?
You see the shooter?

15:41.566 --> 15:42.773
You see him?

15:46.404 --> 15:48.236
Get... Get down,
get down, man.

15:48.322 --> 15:50.655
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Diego, get down!

15:53.035 --> 15:54.822
They weren't here for us.

15:54.912 --> 15:56.574
- What?
- They were here for him.

16:03.087 --> 16:04.453
Fuck.

16:07.550 --> 16:08.757
<i>LAPD's finest...</i>

16:08.843 --> 16:10.880
LAPD's best and brightest.

16:10.970 --> 16:14.338
Fucking city cops, the guys
that can't even be entrusted

16:14.849 --> 16:17.387
to transport
the only witness to this crime

16:17.477 --> 16:19.184
to their own goddamn precinct.

16:19.270 --> 16:21.353
You may think this matters,
Captain Gomez.

16:21.481 --> 16:22.767
It doesn't,
it's federal now.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.598
Especially with
a dozen dead bodies.

16:24.734 --> 16:26.350
And the one witness
to this shooting

16:26.486 --> 16:29.069
shot out from under you
while in your custody.

16:29.155 --> 16:30.441
What the fuck?

16:31.449 --> 16:32.885
I'd ask you to trim your tone,
agent.

16:32.909 --> 16:35.304
I don't like anyone yelling at
me in my office that isn't me.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.128
Captain, we know you're
sandbagging us.

16:37.163 --> 16:39.120
Why don't we just
establish that right now?

16:40.082 --> 16:42.699
Jurisdiction isn't just
a five-dollar word, fellas.

16:42.960 --> 16:45.373
It happens to be what I have,
and what I'm exercising

16:45.463 --> 16:46.544
here at the local level.

16:46.631 --> 16:48.150
This is the federal level,
so we are going to interview

16:48.174 --> 16:50.507
all your first responders
and every single cop

16:50.593 --> 16:52.129
that had access
to that crime scene.

16:52.386 --> 16:55.675
Especially the two detectives
who transported the victim.

16:55.765 --> 16:57.381
Get this straight,
gentlemen.

16:57.642 --> 17:00.601
My division, my command,
my call.

17:01.938 --> 17:04.430
Now, if you want to
get a court injunction

17:04.523 --> 17:06.607
to supersede that authority,
have at it.

17:07.108 --> 17:08.974
But the City of Los Angeles
pays my mortgage,

17:09.069 --> 17:10.435
and that's
who I work for.

17:12.323 --> 17:14.760
All right, well, we're not leaving here
until we get an opportunity

17:14.784 --> 17:16.428
to interview those
two fucking idiot detectives

17:16.452 --> 17:18.284
that transported,
what's his name, Silent.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.328
Good, there's
a wooden bench out there

17:20.414 --> 17:21.530
with both your names on it.

17:23.166 --> 17:25.250
So, thank you,
and fuck you.

17:25.336 --> 17:27.453
- Fuck you!
- Nice. Motherfucker.

17:30.216 --> 17:32.056
No, no, no.
It's just a little blood.

17:32.510 --> 17:33.654
You don't have
to come down here.

17:33.678 --> 17:35.280
- Chrissy, don't come down here.
- Did you both get checked out?

17:35.304 --> 17:36.715
- I gotta go.
- We're fine, Captain.

17:36.806 --> 17:38.526
You got fucking blood
all over your clothes.

17:39.141 --> 17:41.178
Now, what the high holy fuck
happened with Silent?

17:41.269 --> 17:43.807
He got sniped,
by one hell of a shooter.

17:43.896 --> 17:46.513
Or just straight mercenaries
based on the precision of that hit.

17:47.900 --> 17:51.268
Boss, Shotgun might have had
his own squad killed.

17:51.696 --> 17:53.215
Wait a minute.
Did Silent confirm this?

17:53.239 --> 17:55.731
He said, and I quote,
"We were never Shotgun's <i>cliqua."</i>

17:56.033 --> 17:58.525
Why don't we issue for Shotgun,
get that fucker in here?

17:58.619 --> 18:00.430
No, that fucking APB
will get picked up by the Feds,

18:00.454 --> 18:03.141
and it will become a fucking track
meet to see who gets to him first.

18:03.165 --> 18:05.519
They don't know about Shotgun,
and we need to keep it that way

18:05.543 --> 18:07.125
until we can lock
him down ourselves.

18:07.211 --> 18:09.171
Hey, do you wanna talk about
what else Silent said

18:09.213 --> 18:10.374
before he was shot?

18:13.467 --> 18:15.347
What the fuck is this, therapy?
What did he say?

18:16.637 --> 18:18.094
Diego, what did he say?

18:18.472 --> 18:20.589
Nothing. Shit talk.

18:21.058 --> 18:23.339
That my brother didn't kill himself,
that he was murdered.

18:23.686 --> 18:25.539
And the only person that would
believe that wholeheartedly

18:25.563 --> 18:26.563
would be my mother.

18:26.981 --> 18:28.792
This investigation is gonna have
every swinging dick

18:28.816 --> 18:30.335
between here and Ventura County
trying to wax

18:30.359 --> 18:32.271
their fucking resume
with my murder scene.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.774
The only leg up
we have left is your brother.

18:34.905 --> 18:37.773
Get into his world, Diego,
and find out who's fucking with ours.

18:52.798 --> 18:56.633
- I miss him every day, <i>mijo.</i>
- Yeah, I know you do, Mom.

19:12.943 --> 19:15.026
Mom, um,

19:15.112 --> 19:17.069
what did you do
with Pedro's belongings,

19:17.198 --> 19:18.655
the stuff he left in his room?

19:19.659 --> 19:22.026
I haven't touched his room
since he passed.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.200
Is there anything
in there?

19:27.750 --> 19:29.161
A box from prison.

19:30.544 --> 19:33.708
Stuff from his cell.
That's basically it.

19:34.882 --> 19:36.722
Mom, I'm working a case
that might be connected

19:36.801 --> 19:37.837
to Pedro's death.

19:38.344 --> 19:41.337
Bunch of guys were gunned down
in a warehouse off Soto Street.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.722
Could these be the same people
that killed your brother?

19:46.102 --> 19:47.218
Maybe.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.220
And can you catch them?

19:52.108 --> 19:53.394
It's a possibility.

19:56.987 --> 19:58.694
Let's go see
what's in there.

21:15.274 --> 21:16.560
<i>Where you from?</i>

21:51.727 --> 21:54.265
I could never bring myself
to go through his things.

21:55.731 --> 21:56.767
Is that bad?

21:57.733 --> 21:59.065
Why would
that be bad, Mom?

22:01.529 --> 22:02.736
I don't know, <i>mijo.</i>

22:05.241 --> 22:07.904
I feel like if I don't feel sad
for your brother

22:08.035 --> 22:11.244
and remind myself of that
sadness, then...

22:13.457 --> 22:17.701
His spirit might
somehow slip away.

22:24.468 --> 22:27.506
Is this it?
All his stuff?

22:28.013 --> 22:29.925
He didn't live here
that long.

22:31.308 --> 22:33.174
And he still had that,

22:34.019 --> 22:35.351
what do they call it,

22:36.438 --> 22:38.430
"cellblock mentality."

22:40.025 --> 22:41.391
You mean,
he hid things.

22:43.487 --> 22:45.479
I mean,
he lived very simply.

22:56.250 --> 22:57.912
How did he
spend his days, Mom?

23:00.754 --> 23:02.996
You know, these are things
that you would know

23:03.090 --> 23:05.673
if you had put
your pride aside

23:05.759 --> 23:07.125
and reconnected
with your brother.

23:07.219 --> 23:09.099
Look, I don't want to reopen
all this right now.

23:09.638 --> 23:12.802
- Pedro and I were very different people.
- You were brothers.

23:13.309 --> 23:16.427
And that should have mattered
to the both of you.

23:17.062 --> 23:18.662
Did he have any mail
coming to the house?

23:19.648 --> 23:20.980
You should have...

23:22.401 --> 23:24.609
You should have looked out
for him, Diego.

23:24.737 --> 23:26.524
You should
have tried harder.

23:27.865 --> 23:29.857
He looked up to you.

23:30.784 --> 23:33.322
Mom, what did
we call him?

23:34.121 --> 23:35.532
"Shortcut."

23:36.665 --> 23:38.122
That's what we called him,

23:38.292 --> 23:40.158
and everyone
thought it was funny

23:40.669 --> 23:43.002
till at some point,
it wasn't funny no more.

23:44.173 --> 23:46.290
Didn't want
to do the work.

23:46.800 --> 23:50.134
That was Pedro.
Did not want to do the work.

23:50.721 --> 23:53.338
Didn't matter what I did,
how I tried to help him out,

23:53.432 --> 23:55.298
hook him up with jobs,
with legit jobs.

23:55.726 --> 23:57.308
He wanted
to sling dope.

24:00.564 --> 24:03.648
You defend
a drug dealer, still.

24:04.151 --> 24:05.938
You dishonor
your brother.

24:06.028 --> 24:08.896
No, you do.

24:09.907 --> 24:11.569
And you dishonor me

24:11.909 --> 24:15.778
and all the hard work that I put in,
to not be dead before my 30th birthday.

24:17.164 --> 24:20.874
Are you really going
to find out who killed my son?

24:21.919 --> 24:23.000
Your son?

24:24.213 --> 24:25.875
Who are you speaking to,
right now?

24:26.674 --> 24:27.915
<i>La jura?</i>

24:28.592 --> 24:30.003
The police?

24:31.136 --> 24:33.156
You've never made me feel bad
about being a cop, Susanna.

24:33.180 --> 24:34.637
Don't start now.

24:35.516 --> 24:39.430
Then don't make me feel bad
about being a mother, Detective.

24:44.024 --> 24:46.516
Pedro's mail is next
to the phone in the kitchen.

25:11.802 --> 25:13.043
- Hey.
<i>- Hey, man.</i>

25:13.137 --> 25:14.617
<i>I think I'm onto
something at Pedro's.</i>

25:14.722 --> 25:16.964
I found a photo
of Shotgun, my brother

25:17.808 --> 25:19.800
and this third cat
whose face is scratched out.

25:19.893 --> 25:21.453
"Know thy enemy"
is written on the back.

25:21.562 --> 25:23.915
If that ain't a world-class fucking clue,
we ain't gonna get one.

25:23.939 --> 25:25.625
Yeah, well, the Feds are good
at reconstructing

25:25.649 --> 25:27.561
these kinds of images overnight,
but we're not.

25:27.693 --> 25:29.337
<i>You know, I got this buddy
back in the Chi,</i>

25:29.361 --> 25:30.522
<i>he works for Homeland.</i>

25:30.612 --> 25:33.216
I tell you what, take a couple of pictures
on your phone, send them through.

25:33.240 --> 25:35.360
- I'll see if he can help us out.
- Cool. Sending now.

25:46.628 --> 25:50.793
So, in 1846, the United States
declared war on Mexico,

25:51.133 --> 25:53.045
then President James Polk

25:53.177 --> 25:55.885
sent Marines to secure
the State of California,

25:55.971 --> 25:57.963
which was still
a Mexican territory.

25:58.599 --> 26:01.262
U.S. Navy Commodore
Robert F. Stockton arrived

26:01.351 --> 26:06.062
on July 14th and declared
California conquered.

26:06.607 --> 26:09.771
But the early Angelenos,
people like you,

26:09.902 --> 26:13.270
and you and me,
did not surrender so easily

26:13.489 --> 26:15.355
and we revolted
against these soldiers

26:15.449 --> 26:17.987
eventually winning
the Siege of Los Angeles.

26:18.994 --> 26:20.610
<i>Firme que no?</i>

26:21.705 --> 26:24.448
Okay, <i>chavalitos.</i>
That's it for today.

26:24.541 --> 26:26.895
Remember, next week
we're gonna be talking about

26:26.919 --> 26:31.289
the playwright Luis Valdez,
the artist...

26:31.381 --> 26:33.714
The journalist Ruben Salazar

26:33.801 --> 26:36.134
and all
my <i>Chicano</i> heroes, huh?

26:37.137 --> 26:40.130
<i>√ìrale,</i> kids.
You take care, huh?

26:46.396 --> 26:48.416
You must have told me
about the Siege of Los Angeles

26:48.440 --> 26:50.181
at least 100 times, <i>que no.</i>

26:50.400 --> 26:53.814
Some stories never get old, <i>ese.</i>
They keep teaching us.

26:55.572 --> 26:57.814
- So you caught a burner, huh?
- You heard.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.442
Yeah, I mean,
I hear about everything.

27:01.036 --> 27:02.948
So you heard that
every last one of those <i>vatos</i>

27:03.038 --> 27:04.529
was tattooed
with the word "Mito"?

27:08.961 --> 27:11.374
I can't talk to my mom
about Pedro, Jesus.

27:12.256 --> 27:13.622
She's too emotional.

27:13.715 --> 27:16.628
But I know that, uh,
you kept up with him,

27:17.261 --> 27:19.127
and I need to find out
exactly what the fuck

27:19.221 --> 27:20.837
he was up to
these last few years.

27:23.725 --> 27:26.638
I could tell you this,
and this you probably already know,

27:27.229 --> 27:29.892
but your brother
had a pull, Diego.

27:30.816 --> 27:32.523
He drew people in.

27:32.901 --> 27:36.770
He had the makings
of a leader, of a protector.

27:36.864 --> 27:40.574
Come on, Jesus, we both knew
who Pedro was. He banged.

27:41.910 --> 27:43.763
And he got bit by the bullshit
and he went inside.

27:43.787 --> 27:46.951
But that's not the man that
came out of the <i>pinta,</i> homes.

27:47.875 --> 27:50.333
That man was rebuilt.

27:51.003 --> 27:52.585
Reborn.

27:53.088 --> 27:55.205
Sorry.

27:56.633 --> 27:58.795
- Yo, what's up?
<i>- I just found Shotgun.</i>

27:58.927 --> 28:01.169
<i>A robbery homicide.
CI dimed him out.</i>

28:01.305 --> 28:02.967
<i>He's throwing a pachanga
on Cesar Chavez.</i>

28:03.098 --> 28:04.885
Hang tight, I'm on my way.

28:05.767 --> 28:08.305
I gotta roll.
Catch you later?

28:09.313 --> 28:10.679
<i>C u √≠d a te,</i> homes, huh?

28:31.376 --> 28:33.208
So, how far back
do you and Shotgun go?

28:33.295 --> 28:34.411
Childhood.

28:35.422 --> 28:37.334
We grew up two blocks
from one another.

28:37.716 --> 28:39.673
His father was a baller
back in the day.

28:39.760 --> 28:41.797
This <i>vato loco</i> shot-caller
named Shadow.

28:41.929 --> 28:43.761
Got murdered
when we were kids.

28:44.932 --> 28:47.049
Shotgun's eclipsed
his old man in every way.

28:47.601 --> 28:49.058
I call him
"Malibu's Most Wanted."

28:49.394 --> 28:51.331
He's got a big beach house
out in Zuma and only rolls

28:51.355 --> 28:53.115
through the <i>barrio</i>
when he wants to show out.

28:54.024 --> 28:55.185
There he is.

28:57.402 --> 28:58.859
Look at this
fucking crowd.

29:08.038 --> 29:09.825
What kind of asshole
throws a street party

29:09.915 --> 29:12.453
less than 24 hours after
wiping out his own <i>cliqua?</i>

29:12.542 --> 29:14.408
The kind that doesn't
want to appear guilty.

29:23.553 --> 29:26.011
<i>- √ìrale!
- Ah! Que paso, vato!</i>

29:29.518 --> 29:32.602
Detective Diego Hernandez,
huh?

29:32.688 --> 29:37.183
<i>La jura</i> just came
to the hood. Huh? Respect.

29:37.276 --> 29:39.563
- I'm here every night, hustler.
- He takes care of us.

29:39.653 --> 29:41.360
Not paddle-boarding
Point Dume, like you.

29:41.822 --> 29:44.405
It's nice, you should try it,
man. I'll show you around.

29:44.491 --> 29:46.323
- Yeah, invite me down.
- Yeah.

29:46.410 --> 29:48.242
But I gotta
ask you the obvious.

29:49.037 --> 29:50.640
How is it you're out here
rolling this hard

29:50.664 --> 29:52.984
when all your homies are lying
dead in the morgue downtown?

29:53.041 --> 29:55.909
Ah, Detective, the LAPD has
robbed you of your heritage.

29:56.253 --> 29:59.041
This is how we
celebrate the dead.

29:59.548 --> 30:03.417
When I die,
I want you and you

30:03.760 --> 30:07.094
and all y'all motherfuckers
to rage.

30:07.222 --> 30:09.305
I'm sure you got nothing
to worry about there.

30:09.516 --> 30:12.304
It'll be a fucking block party when you go down, dawg.

30:14.146 --> 30:16.346
Yeah, well, I mean,
that's gonna be a minute, Detective.

30:18.233 --> 30:19.849
Yeah, I'm sure it is.

30:22.571 --> 30:25.939
You never did get that scar
stitched up, did you?

30:26.658 --> 30:29.150
I'm sure you told your homies here
you caught a shiv at county,

30:29.703 --> 30:31.569
but we both know the truth,
don't we?

30:32.956 --> 30:34.996
Your mom was like Indiana Jones
once she got started

30:35.083 --> 30:36.519
with that belt, homie.
You remember that shit?

30:36.543 --> 30:38.159
<i>Bas, bas, bas.</i>

30:38.253 --> 30:39.744
Damn, man,
she fucked you up.

30:39.838 --> 30:42.831
How many fucking times
have I told you to respect me?

30:44.509 --> 30:45.875
Well, check
this out, officers.

30:46.386 --> 30:48.719
Tomorrow, we got a lowrider
party coming through.

30:48.889 --> 30:50.972
So many bitches,
all right?

30:51.099 --> 30:52.744
I know with your salary,
you probably won't be able

30:52.768 --> 30:55.385
to get a girl,
but I got groupies.

30:58.565 --> 31:01.433
Please tell me this fool Jose
is not for real.

31:03.570 --> 31:05.607
Who the fuck you calling
Jose, <i>cabr√≥n?</i>

31:06.948 --> 31:08.940
Who the fuck is Jose?

31:09.076 --> 31:10.283
You, asshole.

31:12.829 --> 31:14.365
Where'd you
find this coconut?

31:17.084 --> 31:20.327
How about you take off
that badge and that <i>pistola</i>

31:20.420 --> 31:21.900
and we'll handle it out
like real men?

31:21.963 --> 31:23.625
Throw it down for real.

31:24.549 --> 31:26.632
Or we can throw them deuces
in the streets.

31:27.928 --> 31:30.921
High noon, nigga,
call it.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.347
You challenging a cop
to a gunfight?

31:33.475 --> 31:34.966
This ain't your territory,
homeboy.

31:37.854 --> 31:40.471
I see you.
I see my brother, Pedro.

31:41.983 --> 31:43.565
Help me out
with the third fool.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.071
Don't know him.

31:52.661 --> 31:55.101
Well, something tells me,
I find out who this motherfucker is,

31:57.457 --> 31:59.198
then all the pieces
fall into place.

32:08.009 --> 32:09.689
The Feds are going to come
looking for you.

32:10.137 --> 32:11.799
Those murders
got a lot of dicks hard.

32:12.472 --> 32:14.088
They're looking for
someone to fuck.

32:15.434 --> 32:16.515
Have fun.

32:19.312 --> 32:20.598
That's what I thought.

32:22.649 --> 32:23.649
Dress me up.

32:32.659 --> 32:34.821
- What the fuck was that?
- What the fuck...

32:34.911 --> 32:36.389
What do you mean?
What the fuck was that?

32:36.413 --> 32:37.745
He tapped his
goddamn waistband.

32:38.665 --> 32:40.406
He challenged me
to a gunfight, what the...

32:40.500 --> 32:42.537
Bullshit. He went in on you
and you didn't like it.

32:42.711 --> 32:44.418
Fuck your pride
and play it out.

32:45.130 --> 32:46.649
He lets us process him
and perp walk him

32:46.673 --> 32:48.130
and do three hours
of paperwork,

32:48.258 --> 32:50.341
and the moment
his ass hits a chair,

32:50.469 --> 32:52.381
he says one word, "lawyer."

32:52.637 --> 32:55.254
And he'll do it just to fuck
with us and waste our time.

32:55.932 --> 32:58.174
If we don't have him ice-cold
for the crime of murder,

32:58.477 --> 33:00.013
we don't have him at all.

33:01.897 --> 33:03.729
It's my boy.
It's my boy, hold on.

33:04.274 --> 33:05.731
Mikey. Talk to me, dawg.

33:07.360 --> 33:08.851
My motherfucker!
No, no, no.

33:08.945 --> 33:10.607
Send it through now.
We got it.

33:13.575 --> 33:16.192
Saul Campos,
AKA "Jaws."

33:16.328 --> 33:19.071
Rumored to be the illegitimate
son of this asswipe.

33:19.748 --> 33:23.037
Alejandro Truco,
AKA "El Gallo."

33:23.210 --> 33:26.578
The de facto head of the Verdugo Cartel
out of Sinaloa, Mexico.

33:26.755 --> 33:29.623
Jaws was serving a five-year
bid up at Tehachapi,

33:29.758 --> 33:31.294
and he's set to be
released tomorrow.

33:31.384 --> 33:33.467
Paroled out 10 months early
for good behavior.

33:33.595 --> 33:35.336
There's the reason
for Shotgun's party.

33:35.764 --> 33:37.221
It's a welcome home for Jaws.

33:37.307 --> 33:39.048
Why haven't I heard
of this fucking guy?

33:39.184 --> 33:41.847
Unlike most clowns that
claim to be El Gallo's son,

33:42.229 --> 33:45.222
Saul here, he's kept his mouth shut.
He's an anchor baby.

33:45.482 --> 33:47.314
You know, Moms
was some minor felon

33:47.400 --> 33:49.437
that El Gallo banged
on a field trip to LA.

33:49.611 --> 33:51.477
Homegirl,
she hung onto the kid,

33:51.613 --> 33:54.526
moved back to Mexico
a-a-and got paid.

33:54.616 --> 33:56.198
There's rumors that
she's the one really

33:56.284 --> 33:57.650
running the show
in Sinaloa.

33:58.203 --> 34:01.321
Now, El Gallo, he's rare,
in that he's a known nationalist,

34:01.414 --> 34:03.872
big believer
in the notion of Reconquista,

34:04.167 --> 34:06.500
the reclamation
of the former Mexican Empire

34:06.586 --> 34:08.578
before the secession of 1848.

34:09.005 --> 34:10.166
The fuck does that mean?

34:10.507 --> 34:12.168
It means that
he thinks that Cali

34:12.384 --> 34:15.127
along with the entire
southwestern portion of the US

34:15.262 --> 34:16.878
should return
to Mexican rule.

34:18.431 --> 34:19.951
The way that Hitler
wanted Europe back.

34:22.143 --> 34:23.850
I think we have
our bad guys.

34:26.022 --> 34:28.480
Shotgun gave up the <i>cliqua</i>
to the Verdugos.

34:29.192 --> 34:32.856
The Mexicans are expanding up north
and he wants a big seat at the table.

34:35.239 --> 34:37.777
Jaws being released means
they can start making moves.

34:38.827 --> 34:40.614
The <i>cliqua</i>
wasn't feeling this.

34:41.121 --> 34:43.864
They didn't exactly want
to hand over East Los to the cartel.

34:44.123 --> 34:46.036
Especially not to
someone like El Gallo.

34:47.002 --> 34:50.040
Shotgun knew this,
and cleaned house.

34:51.840 --> 34:53.456
And took down
his own <i>cliqua.</i>

34:56.303 --> 34:58.340
How does all that sound
when I say it out loud?

34:59.973 --> 35:02.431
- It sounds about right.
- Okay.

35:02.517 --> 35:05.055
But what does any of this
have to do with your brother?

35:16.281 --> 35:20.776
"Remember always, that all of us,
and you and I especially,

35:21.036 --> 35:23.494
"are descended from immigrants
and revolutionists.

35:23.622 --> 35:25.659
"Franklin Delano Roosevelt."

35:32.255 --> 35:34.042
"A revolution is not
a bed of roses.

35:34.257 --> 35:39.503
"A revolution is a struggle between
the future and the past. Fidel Castro."

35:41.765 --> 35:43.097
Hey.

35:47.228 --> 35:48.514
Give me a kiss.

35:48.730 --> 35:51.939
No, I just woke up,
my breath is funky.

35:52.025 --> 35:54.984
I don't care,
I like funky.

36:08.833 --> 36:10.244
What's wrong?

36:12.837 --> 36:14.044
The case.

36:15.256 --> 36:16.542
My brother.

36:19.010 --> 36:20.751
He had all these books
on revolution.

36:21.262 --> 36:22.924
American, French, Russian.

36:24.015 --> 36:25.368
I don't get it,
my brother wasn't like this.

36:25.392 --> 36:26.724
He wasn't into this shit.

36:28.061 --> 36:29.427
Maybe he was, babe.

36:31.439 --> 36:34.398
I mean, you admit that you stopped
really knowing him.

36:34.859 --> 36:37.226
You haven't seen him
in so long, maybe...

36:37.904 --> 36:41.272
Maybe he changed.
Maybe prison changed him.

36:41.616 --> 36:42.777
He was a thug.

36:43.159 --> 36:46.493
Okay? He was a bad guy
who dealt drugs and shot people.

36:47.580 --> 36:49.242
He was your brother,
Diego.

36:49.958 --> 36:51.199
He was your brother.

36:52.293 --> 36:55.536
And I'm sure there was a time
that you loved him very much.

36:56.840 --> 36:59.048
<i>When you were boys,
when you were little,</i>

36:59.551 --> 37:01.213
<i>when you were</i> chavalitos.

37:01.511 --> 37:03.047
<i>Where you from?</i>

37:04.097 --> 37:06.054
And you know if all of this
is that clear-cut,

37:06.141 --> 37:08.053
and he really
is just a thug,

37:08.560 --> 37:10.267
why is it still
bothering you?

37:13.982 --> 37:15.143
Listen to this.

37:18.111 --> 37:19.943
"We are Mexican-American."

37:20.739 --> 37:22.230
"American" is in all caps.

37:23.450 --> 37:25.863
"No Crip or Blood ever banged
for Nigeria or Ghana,

37:25.952 --> 37:28.032
"or the continent of Africa.
They banged for Compton.

37:29.289 --> 37:31.622
"I bang for <i>mi barrio.</i>
For East Los.

37:31.708 --> 37:34.792
<i>"Por vida,</i> for I am Mexican-American."
Again in all caps.

37:37.172 --> 37:40.631
The dead <i>vatos</i> in that warehouse,
they were inked with the same tattoo.

37:40.717 --> 37:45.132
"Mito," which was Pedro's nickname
and the numbers 9-9-8-6.

37:46.765 --> 37:49.303
- Your birthday.
- And his.

37:53.938 --> 37:54.999
I didn't want you to get
all weird about it.

37:55.023 --> 37:58.391
No, you didn't wanna admit
that this freaked you out.

38:05.909 --> 38:07.616
Pedro is reaching
out to you.

38:08.453 --> 38:10.740
Vanessa, come on,
you sound like Mom.

38:11.122 --> 38:12.850
Okay? Don't get all
voodoo <i>Mexicana bruja</i> on me.

38:12.874 --> 38:13.934
- I don't like that shit.
- Okay.

38:13.958 --> 38:16.041
You don't you think
it's just a little bit unusual

38:16.127 --> 38:18.047
that your biggest case
since becoming a detective

38:18.087 --> 38:20.420
is somehow connected
to your own brother?

38:22.091 --> 38:24.708
I've always believed
in that stuff, man.

38:24.803 --> 38:28.422
Signs, intuitions,
gut feelings,

38:28.515 --> 38:32.225
just things that make the hair
on the back of your neck stand up.

38:33.478 --> 38:35.185
You may not believe
in that energy,

38:35.438 --> 38:38.181
the energy that the dead
carry for the living,

38:40.527 --> 38:41.938
but it's real.

38:44.405 --> 38:45.816
It's real.

38:52.789 --> 38:54.621
Don't stay up
too late, okay?

40:41.731 --> 40:43.347
10 x 30?

40:43.483 --> 40:45.315
What the fuck?

41:00.875 --> 41:02.366
That's 10.

41:04.587 --> 41:06.123
That ain't 30.

41:31.239 --> 41:32.571
What the fuck?

42:17.618 --> 42:19.280
What the hell?

42:37.472 --> 42:38.883
Shit.

42:52.612 --> 42:54.854
What the fuck is this?

43:26.062 --> 43:27.062
Oh, my God.

43:50.586 --> 43:51.997
Diego.

43:53.214 --> 43:55.001
What does this
mean to you?

43:55.550 --> 43:56.882
Come in.

44:06.352 --> 44:11.143
It was like this, a lair almost,
like a ghetto Batcave.

44:13.109 --> 44:15.066
I've never seen
anything like it before.

44:15.319 --> 44:19.029
He had a blacked-out Harley
with riding leathers that were retailored

44:19.115 --> 44:23.280
to slot ballistic plates,
fucking bullet-proofing, Jesus.

44:24.662 --> 44:25.823
I remember where I saw this.

44:27.790 --> 44:30.533
That freak that killed Shadow
when we were kids.

44:30.710 --> 44:31.750
The man on the motorcycle.

44:32.336 --> 44:33.452
Diego, wait!

44:34.547 --> 44:35.833
Who was he?

44:58.821 --> 44:59.902
El Chicano.

45:00.406 --> 45:03.069
<i>Holy shit.
I remember this.</i>

45:04.160 --> 45:05.401
The cucuy.

45:05.494 --> 45:06.985
That's what
he was, Diego.

45:08.497 --> 45:10.989
A ghoul.
A ghost story.

45:12.627 --> 45:14.459
He used to mark
neighborhoods.

45:15.630 --> 45:20.341
If you saw it, it meant somebody
on your block was a target.

45:21.344 --> 45:24.178
Someone
was getting killed.

45:24.931 --> 45:29.392
In the <i>barrio,</i> bad things happen
when the sky turns black.

45:34.815 --> 45:36.022
Who was he?

45:36.108 --> 45:38.600
I've heard stories going back
as far as the '40s.

45:40.112 --> 45:42.650
After the
Zoot Suit Riots.

45:42.865 --> 45:46.654
This <i>misterioso</i>
black-hooded motorcyclist

45:46.744 --> 45:49.532
is spotted moving
through the <i>barrio.</i>

45:50.498 --> 45:53.206
These little
urban legends,

45:53.292 --> 45:57.332
stay alive through the '50s,
and the '60s, the '70s.

45:58.422 --> 46:00.630
Anytime shit got hot
in the hood,

46:02.134 --> 46:05.593
you'd hear those
chopper pipes, homes,

46:06.055 --> 46:09.139
and motherfuckers would put their
<i>pistolas</i> away and call it a day.

46:10.434 --> 46:13.768
The gangsters found God
out of fear of the devil.

46:15.856 --> 46:19.520
I found this in the unit.
There's dozens of them.

46:21.404 --> 46:23.004
Journal entries
talking about revolution.

46:25.366 --> 46:28.359
He considered the cartel
an invading force,

46:28.452 --> 46:31.695
that was coming to reclaim the city,
the <i>barrio.</i>

46:33.165 --> 46:35.498
And they had to be
battled back and beaten

46:35.626 --> 46:38.414
like the original colonists
fought back the fucking British.

46:40.423 --> 46:42.255
Listen to this, man.

46:44.468 --> 46:48.712
"My brother Diego can fight this fight
from the side that is right and good.

46:49.473 --> 46:51.510
"I am neither right nor good.

46:52.435 --> 46:54.472
"I will make up the difference
in blood."

46:56.022 --> 46:58.264
He was amassing
these things, Jesus.

46:59.817 --> 47:02.275
Gathering them up.

47:02.445 --> 47:05.529
The mask, the motorcycle,
the stencil.

47:07.616 --> 47:10.404
I think he wanted
to become this.

47:13.289 --> 47:14.871
And never did.

47:23.883 --> 47:25.443
- Yo.
<i>- Jaws just made parole.</i>

47:25.760 --> 47:27.797
<i>- He's on his way to LA.</i>
- I'm on my way.

47:30.931 --> 47:32.092
Gotta go.

47:32.183 --> 47:33.424
<i>√ìrale, carnal.</i>

48:03.339 --> 48:04.859
They're holding
this shit down tonight.

48:08.886 --> 48:12.175
Look at Happy Feet over there.
Not a care in the world.

48:15.267 --> 48:17.133
This fucking clown.

48:17.561 --> 48:20.599
I just want to wipe that smug-ass smile
off that motherfucker's face.

48:22.983 --> 48:25.600
Maybe break both his arms
when I slap him in cuffs.

48:28.823 --> 48:30.906
I may have given it
some thought.

48:33.661 --> 48:36.278
Yo, you dig up
anything new on Pedro?

48:40.334 --> 48:43.452
You want to hear something
I never thought I'd hear myself say?

48:44.964 --> 48:46.546
What's that?

48:46.632 --> 48:49.375
I'm no longer 100% certain
my brother killed himself.

48:50.010 --> 48:51.922
Really? Why?

48:53.639 --> 48:55.505
Things he was doing
before he died.

48:56.559 --> 48:58.642
Those <i>vatos,</i>
the tattoos.

49:00.396 --> 49:01.682
They were loyal
to my brother.

49:02.940 --> 49:05.057
Or at least
what they thought he stood for.

49:05.526 --> 49:06.526
You know, did you ever

49:06.610 --> 49:10.194
get a look at your brother's
homicide sheet, morgue book?

49:13.576 --> 49:16.034
His death was
ruled a suicide.

49:19.957 --> 49:22.745
I never even spoke
to the detective in charge.

49:28.799 --> 49:30.461
Oh, yeah.
Here we go.

49:33.304 --> 49:34.840
Looks like a VIP.

49:35.848 --> 49:37.305
Yep.

49:38.434 --> 49:39.641
Is that our guy?

49:41.187 --> 49:43.520
- Hello, Jaws.
- Bingo.

49:45.024 --> 49:47.892
Oh, them motherfuckers
are thick as thieves.

49:48.652 --> 49:49.938
You little bitches.

49:51.447 --> 49:52.927
Let's see if we can
pick this shit up.

49:54.033 --> 49:55.865
Fuck, can you
hear that, man?

49:57.119 --> 50:00.032
Shit, they're speaking Spanish.
You take Jaws, I'll take Shotgun.

50:00.122 --> 50:01.962
Yeah. It's shitty, man.
I can barely hear them.

50:03.667 --> 50:06.831
"You gotta keep shit
on the DL, <i>ese.</i>

50:06.921 --> 50:08.207
Uh...

50:08.380 --> 50:13.045
"Too much heat with the
with the cops and FBI."

50:13.427 --> 50:17.091
"Well, you see the cops are fucked up.
Fuck the cops and the Feds."

50:18.891 --> 50:22.350
"We're gonna war.
All of them, <i>todos."</i>

50:22.811 --> 50:24.623
Something... Fuck, man, I can't hear...

50:24.647 --> 50:25.957
- It's fucking cutting out.
- Cutting-off heads...

50:25.981 --> 50:27.792
- Shit, no, fuck this, man.
- We're missing it. Come on.

50:27.816 --> 50:30.809
All right, turn on the engine.

50:35.491 --> 50:38.279
- Come on.
- All right. Okay, good, good, good.

50:41.038 --> 50:42.745
Yeah. All right,
we're back, we're back.

50:44.166 --> 50:46.909
"Are we going to handle the unit?"
What the fuck is a unit?

50:49.797 --> 50:53.541
"Stay down, low.
Just stay down

50:53.676 --> 50:56.510
"till we line the shit up.
That's the unit."

50:58.055 --> 50:59.842
"Understand.
Where they at now?"

51:01.141 --> 51:02.177
"Split them up.

51:04.186 --> 51:06.303
"Got a few at the chateau.
Uh...

51:08.691 --> 51:13.356
"The others are at the Standard...
And the Sunset Tower."

51:13.862 --> 51:15.194
"That's the strip, yeah.

51:15.698 --> 51:17.940
"Yeah, on the strip.
Cool, cool, cool.

51:18.450 --> 51:19.657
"Cool."

51:21.245 --> 51:23.202
"We'll hit the Marquee
tomorrow night.

51:23.289 --> 51:25.656
"Get the <i>Mexicanos</i>
some pussy."

51:27.334 --> 51:28.700
Fucking music.

51:31.839 --> 51:34.172
"Did you hit the memorial?"
Memorial?

51:34.550 --> 51:36.712
"Yeah, yeah, I did."

51:39.138 --> 51:41.926
"Traitors, traitors.
All of them.

51:43.142 --> 51:45.930
"And we still gave them bitch asses
professional deaths.

51:48.397 --> 51:50.480
"Didn't spare a dime
on that shit.

51:52.568 --> 51:53.934
"Not like their
little leader."

51:57.740 --> 51:59.481
"He's not no Mito
no more."

52:00.659 --> 52:02.299
""Cause you took care
of that shit, dawg."

52:03.454 --> 52:05.696
- "You know I did."
- Fuck.

52:05.789 --> 52:08.059
You get that, motherfucker just
admitted to killing your...

52:08.083 --> 52:09.699
Holy shit!

52:10.169 --> 52:11.169
Fuck!

52:16.592 --> 52:18.128
Diego, I'm hit!

52:20.554 --> 52:23.388
Fuck, we got made,
we got fucking made. Shit!

52:26.894 --> 52:28.430
Oh, fuck, they're coming,
man. Hold on.

52:30.314 --> 52:33.057
- Fuck, you're hit, man. Oh, fuck.
- Fuck your hands, man.

52:33.150 --> 52:35.390
Put it up against the wound!
Put it up against the wound!

52:38.530 --> 52:41.819
- Press it up there. Come on, Dave.
- I'm fucking hit.

52:44.578 --> 52:46.765
- I'm hit. I'm hit, man. Oh, God!
- Dave, come on. Fuck, Dave.

52:46.789 --> 52:49.532
Dave. Dave. Fuck. Fuck.
Stay with me, Dave.

52:49.625 --> 52:51.161
Stay with me, man.
You got this.

52:52.961 --> 52:56.079
Fuck! Come on, Dave!
Stay with me.

52:56.173 --> 52:57.755
We're gonna put
that shit back in.

52:57.841 --> 52:59.986
I swear to God I'm gonna get you
to the fucking hospital.

53:00.010 --> 53:01.967
They're gonna
put it right back in.

53:03.722 --> 53:05.509
Fuck off, motherfuckers!

53:18.529 --> 53:23.194
Fuck! Ah, fuck, Dave.
Come on, man. Fuck! Fuck!

53:23.325 --> 53:24.987
Come on, man, you're LAPD!

53:25.077 --> 53:27.055
There's no one tougher than you.
Come on, motherfucker.

53:27.079 --> 53:31.244
You'll be fine. You got this, Dave! Come on. No, no, no!

53:31.375 --> 53:34.493
Fuck! Fuck! Come on,
motherfucker! No!

53:34.712 --> 53:37.750
Not now, not now,
you fucking bitch. Turn over.

53:37.840 --> 53:39.627
Turn over, you piece
of fucking shit!

53:40.175 --> 53:42.633
Fuck! Come on,
man, come on!

53:42.803 --> 53:44.465
Motherfucker, come on!

53:44.596 --> 53:47.088
Fucking piece of shit!
God damn it.

53:47.266 --> 53:49.724
Come on. Hang on, Dave.
Hang on, Dave.

53:49.810 --> 53:52.723
Fuck! Start,
motherfucker, start!

53:52.813 --> 53:55.556
God damn it!
Fucking turn over.

53:56.400 --> 54:01.236
Turn over, you piece of shit.
Fuck! Start, motherfucker, start!

54:01.947 --> 54:04.189
Start, you little
piece of shit!

54:25.554 --> 54:26.795
Dave!

54:58.670 --> 55:03.335
Dave, Dave...
Come on. Come on, Dave.

55:04.301 --> 55:06.759
Oh, my God.
I got you, I got you.

55:06.845 --> 55:08.586
Come on, Dave. I got you.

55:12.601 --> 55:15.969
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

55:16.271 --> 55:22.233
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

55:36.458 --> 55:39.075
- Get out of my way.
- Hey, what are you doing?

55:39.169 --> 55:41.331
Don't put your hands on me.
Are you out of your mind?

55:41.421 --> 55:43.754
What the fuck...
Are you out of your fucking mind?

55:43.882 --> 55:45.339
You see this,
motherfucker?

55:45.467 --> 55:47.445
- You see this? You see this?
- You're not coming in here!

55:47.469 --> 55:49.197
That means I get
into wherever the fuck I want.

55:49.221 --> 55:50.462
FBI, motherfucker.

55:50.556 --> 55:51.908
- I'll get a subpoena.
- I'll be right here.

55:51.932 --> 55:53.827
Do you know what obstruction
of justice is, Gomez?

55:53.851 --> 55:55.245
- I'll be right here.
- I'm fucking coming back for you.

55:55.269 --> 55:56.412
- Come back, I'll be right here.
- Yeah.

55:56.436 --> 55:57.927
You're not
sitting on this guy!

56:08.407 --> 56:11.900
I knew when you paused outside
to adjust your tie that Dave was dead.

56:19.418 --> 56:22.411
I might have to
suspend you, Diego.

56:22.880 --> 56:24.746
Might not have a choice.

56:26.758 --> 56:29.717
Fucking Feds knocking
on every door in the division.

56:30.053 --> 56:32.010
What about
Martinez's murder?

56:32.431 --> 56:33.797
Shotgun and Jaws, huh?

56:34.099 --> 56:35.180
I can't charge them.

56:36.184 --> 56:38.221
DA will kick it back.

56:38.437 --> 56:41.054
Not enough evidence.

56:41.189 --> 56:42.959
Are you sure you didn't see
one of those fucking assholes

56:42.983 --> 56:44.599
point a smoking pistol at you?

56:46.695 --> 56:49.403
I want to get Vanessa
out of town.

56:49.656 --> 56:51.773
Maybe my mother, too.

56:52.117 --> 56:55.155
Yeah, get them down
to the Den in Oxnard.

56:55.245 --> 56:58.409
The Ventura Sheriff's
keep tabs on them for a while.

56:58.498 --> 57:01.662
Think I wanna put a couple
patrolmen on your door, too.

57:02.461 --> 57:05.124
The accident,
Martinez's stuff,

57:05.213 --> 57:06.499
the camera,
everything burned.

57:08.926 --> 57:10.963
What did you hear?

57:13.972 --> 57:16.305
Shit talk, mostly.
Nothing big.

57:17.726 --> 57:19.058
But they're coming.

57:20.354 --> 57:21.561
The cartel.

57:21.647 --> 57:24.811
The Verdugo...
El Gallo.

57:26.485 --> 57:28.818
He wants to plant a flag in LA
and reset the game,

57:30.238 --> 57:33.402
and it's open season on every one of us
who doesn't wanna see that happen.

57:36.495 --> 57:40.159
You know, Diego, um,
if I was being straight with you,

57:41.500 --> 57:44.038
I have to tell you,
I'm not sure what to do next.

57:53.428 --> 57:55.886
Yeah, okay.

57:57.099 --> 57:58.556
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:00.811 --> 58:01.892
I got it.

58:05.691 --> 58:09.310
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
Mom. Mom, stop.

58:09.611 --> 58:11.568
I'm gonna be okay.

58:12.447 --> 58:14.780
Then why are we
going to Oxnard?

58:17.577 --> 58:20.285
Because I wanna make sure
that you're okay. Okay?

58:22.499 --> 58:25.537
Plus, I know how much
you love <i>la jura.</i>

58:29.131 --> 58:31.544
I only have
to love one cop.

58:36.638 --> 58:39.176
There's a pot of
<i>caldo de res</i> in the fridge.

58:39.266 --> 58:42.759
- Got it.
- And a thin, um, tin of carnitas.

58:42.853 --> 58:44.185
Thank you.

58:46.189 --> 58:47.350
Be safe, <i>mijo,</i> eh?

58:48.275 --> 58:49.607
Extra safe.

58:49.693 --> 58:50.979
Hmm?

59:22.267 --> 59:24.634
- Was work upset with you?
- "Was work upset with me?"

59:24.728 --> 59:26.122
That's the question
you're asking me right now?

59:26.146 --> 59:28.499
Yeah, that you have to take time off.
What's wrong with me asking you that?

59:28.523 --> 59:30.810
I think you're burying
the lede, don't you think?

59:30.901 --> 59:32.341
What the hell happened
with Martinez?

59:35.155 --> 59:36.362
We'll take care of that.

59:36.448 --> 59:38.735
"We'll take care of that."

59:38.825 --> 59:40.094
It's just business
as usual, huh?

59:40.118 --> 59:41.637
And what do you want me to do,
break down and start crying?

59:41.661 --> 59:43.573
You still haven't clarified
any of this for me.

59:43.663 --> 59:45.224
- I'm LAPD, baby.
- How long are we gone for?

59:45.248 --> 59:46.659
We don't do
clarity, okay?

59:48.335 --> 59:49.871
Come on.

59:56.468 --> 59:58.004
Was work upset with you?

59:59.679 --> 01:00:02.672
Actually, I think I'll be
the toast of the break room.

01:00:02.974 --> 01:00:06.012
Not too many elementary
school teachers are marked for death.

01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:09.519
Don't joke about that.

01:00:09.815 --> 01:00:11.602
I have to joke about it

01:00:11.858 --> 01:00:14.566
because the reality of it
makes me want to scream.

01:00:23.328 --> 01:00:26.196
It's just
a precaution, okay?

01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:28.518
We don't know if they were
targeting me, Vaney, okay?

01:00:28.542 --> 01:00:32.081
They... They saw a strange car,
two guys sitting inside...

01:00:32.170 --> 01:00:33.730
And they just started
randomly shooting?

01:00:34.256 --> 01:00:37.294
Yeah.
And just started shooting.

01:00:46.268 --> 01:00:47.634
Babe...

01:00:48.979 --> 01:00:50.436
That look in your eye.

01:00:54.192 --> 01:00:57.356
Yeah. I'm pissed.

01:00:59.739 --> 01:01:02.356
That's not
what I see, baby.

01:01:03.451 --> 01:01:05.033
What do you see?

01:01:08.915 --> 01:01:10.122
Rage.

01:01:28.226 --> 01:01:31.845
<i>Diego, felt like
you should have these things.</i>

01:01:31.938 --> 01:01:35.978
<i>I think Pedro would have wanted
it that way. Jesus.</i>

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:42.780
<i>PS, look at your brother's
sketch of El Chicano.</i>

01:01:43.491 --> 01:01:47.485
<i>On his belt is a tecpatl,
an Aztec war knife.</i>

01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:51.197
<i>They believed
that every soul sacrificed</i>

01:01:51.291 --> 01:01:54.284
<i>at the edge of this blade
would then inhabit</i>

01:01:54.377 --> 01:01:58.963
<i>the knife itself, giving power
to the warrior who wielded it.</i>

01:02:16.483 --> 01:02:20.523
<i>He was amassing these things,
Jesus, gathering them up.</i>

01:02:22.364 --> 01:02:25.983
<i>The mask, the motorcycle.</i>

01:02:28.078 --> 01:02:29.910
<i>I think he wanted
to become this.</i>

01:02:31.998 --> 01:02:33.489
<i>And never did.</i>

01:02:43.051 --> 01:02:45.088
- Where you from?
- East Los.

01:02:49.015 --> 01:02:51.428
- Where you from?
- East Los.

01:03:17.544 --> 01:03:19.786
<i>- Where you from?
- I'm from East Los,</i> ese.

01:03:38.815 --> 01:03:41.523
<i>Did that motherfucker
just admit to killing your brother?</i>

01:04:54.808 --> 01:04:56.970
You're gonna be a good
<i>sicario,</i> homie!

01:04:58.395 --> 01:05:00.728
- What?
<i>- Sicario, ese.</i>

01:05:02.941 --> 01:05:05.228
El Gallo is all about blood,
<i>carnal.</i>

01:05:05.318 --> 01:05:06.729
<i>Mexicano.</i>

01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:08.686
<i>Puro.</i>

01:05:10.407 --> 01:05:12.023
That's me, homie.

01:05:13.076 --> 01:05:15.068
You should be my right hand,
<i>carnalito.</i>

01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:21.658
I bring you along, we can ball out
in this fucking bitch,

01:05:22.168 --> 01:05:24.660
run these fucking
<i>calles, ese.</i>

01:05:24.838 --> 01:05:26.955
You know how
we do this shit.

01:05:28.174 --> 01:05:29.881
<i>√ìrale.</i>

01:05:29.968 --> 01:05:31.960
- Always, huh?
- Always, homie.

01:05:32.053 --> 01:05:34.136
<i>- Por vida.
- Por vida.</i>

01:05:34.222 --> 01:05:35.633
<i>Por Los √Ångeles.</i>

01:05:37.475 --> 01:05:39.592
Let's get some fucking pussy,
homie.

01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:01.660
I'm fucking hit, homie.
Get me to the fucking hospital.

01:07:01.684 --> 01:07:02.844
I got you.
I got you.

01:07:08.566 --> 01:07:10.544
Go kill that motherfucker.
Get the fuck in there!

01:07:19.244 --> 01:07:20.985
I am a good <i>sicario, carnal.</i>

01:07:45.478 --> 01:07:47.014
I run
these streets, homes.

01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:41.816
Fuck...

01:08:57.091 --> 01:08:59.299
- Who's there?
- Open up. It's me.

01:09:02.013 --> 01:09:03.129
Shit.

01:09:04.307 --> 01:09:06.014
Just a minute, Cap.

01:09:14.651 --> 01:09:15.937
Hey, boss.

01:09:17.028 --> 01:09:18.484
Saul Campos is dead.

01:09:18.946 --> 01:09:21.859
Jaws, whatever the fuck
they called him.

01:09:22.241 --> 01:09:25.279
- How?
- Downtown nightclub Marquee.

01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:28.991
What happened?

01:09:29.122 --> 01:09:32.082
Someone rampaged through
that <i>banda,</i> ripshit riot,

01:09:32.210 --> 01:09:35.203
fucked shit up, killed a bunch
of Mexican nationals,

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:36.578
Campos, Jose Galan...

01:09:36.673 --> 01:09:37.788
Shotgun.

01:09:39.175 --> 01:09:40.381
Fucking asshole.

01:09:40.843 --> 01:09:42.603
Apparently, he was there,
but he disappeared.

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:47.093
Who were these
Mexican nationals?

01:09:47.183 --> 01:09:49.515
I'd make them the Soto Street
shooters if I could.

01:09:51.645 --> 01:09:52.886
Your leg is bleeding.

01:09:55.441 --> 01:09:56.441
Huh?

01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:59.397
Your leg,
it's bleeding.

01:10:04.617 --> 01:10:07.075
Goddamn cuts from the crash
keep opening up.

01:10:08.121 --> 01:10:10.784
Mind handing me the rag
from the counter over there, Cap?

01:10:14.043 --> 01:10:16.956
Maybe a bottle of water, too?
These fucking pills.

01:10:22.802 --> 01:10:24.964
Did you put in the paperwork
for my suspension yet?

01:10:27.515 --> 01:10:29.381
Haven't gotten around to it.

01:10:32.562 --> 01:10:34.554
What about Martinez's body?

01:10:35.565 --> 01:10:36.646
What are we doing with it?

01:10:37.734 --> 01:10:40.602
Yeah. Ship him to Chicago.
He's got family there.

01:10:44.073 --> 01:10:45.985
I wanna see him
before you do that.

01:10:46.951 --> 01:10:48.283
That okay?

01:10:52.290 --> 01:10:54.577
So, uh, you have any theories?

01:10:56.544 --> 01:10:58.957
About tonight?
Who hit the spot?

01:11:00.715 --> 01:11:02.401
I mean, when you said
Jaws was dead, I was like,

01:11:02.425 --> 01:11:04.212
"Good. Fuck him."

01:11:06.596 --> 01:11:10.215
Based on that, I don't really see
why my opinion matters, boss.

01:11:11.184 --> 01:11:14.598
He's responsible for Martinez's death
as far as I'm concerned.

01:11:15.062 --> 01:11:16.269
So I'm glad he's gone.

01:11:18.441 --> 01:11:19.960
I just wish they'd gotten
Shotgun, too.

01:11:19.984 --> 01:11:21.850
So you wish you could've taken
a shot at them?

01:11:23.571 --> 01:11:25.233
Bet your ass I do.

01:11:32.622 --> 01:11:34.600
Whatever your brother has
that's relative to this case,

01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:36.115
I'm gonna need
to take it right now.

01:11:37.376 --> 01:11:39.584
- It's just a bunch of prison shit.
- I want it.

01:11:40.838 --> 01:11:41.919
It's right over there.

01:11:57.146 --> 01:11:58.478
Take care of that leg.

01:12:15.623 --> 01:12:16.955
Fuck.

01:12:27.385 --> 01:12:28.751
Shit was crazy, man.

01:12:28.845 --> 01:12:30.239
Motherfuckers
got popped, man.

01:12:30.263 --> 01:12:31.740
<i>Meanwhile, the LAPD</i>

01:12:31.764 --> 01:12:34.973
<i>is still looking for this man believed
to be involved in the shooting.</i>

01:12:35.101 --> 01:12:37.639
<i>The victims have yet to be identified,</i>

01:12:37.728 --> 01:12:40.345
<i>and authorities remain baffled

01:12:40.439 --> 01:12:42.522
<i>behind these gruesome murders.</i>

<i>Early indications are,
they are unconfirmed reports</i>

01:12:45.486 --> 01:12:48.820
<i>at this time, that the victims
are Mexican nationals.</i>

01:12:48.906 --> 01:12:50.442
<i>The club has
a checkered history</i>

01:12:50.533 --> 01:12:54.152
<i>in law enforcement circles

01:13:28.362 --> 01:13:31.730
<i>...this area looking
for the suspect.</i>

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:10.319
This wasn't all for nothing, brother.
I promise.

01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:13.897
They don't run from this.

01:14:16.744 --> 01:14:18.701
And they can't hide.

01:14:20.373 --> 01:14:22.615
Sorry, Detective.
We got processing.

01:14:28.089 --> 01:14:29.421
Who's this?

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:32.173
Another DB
from the Marquee.

01:14:32.843 --> 01:14:34.584
That thing that
went down last night.

01:14:35.596 --> 01:14:37.337
What happened?

01:14:37.556 --> 01:14:39.138
Well, these guys got done,

01:14:39.225 --> 01:14:42.138
and nobody's really talking
about it, which tells me

01:14:42.269 --> 01:14:44.977
I really shouldn't be talking
about it, but it was bad.

01:14:46.107 --> 01:14:47.518
This guy is supposedly

01:14:47.608 --> 01:14:50.316
the son of some
Mexican kingpin drug lord.

01:14:52.405 --> 01:14:54.965
You know, we haven't had
this many bodies come through here ever.

01:14:57.201 --> 01:14:59.443
Sorry, I'll give
you a minute.

01:15:00.454 --> 01:15:01.945
Thanks.

01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:20.881
I didn't
kill you, did I?

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:24.426
Somebody choked you out.

01:15:26.147 --> 01:15:29.231
Shotgun is gonna be along
to join you real soon, Saul.

01:17:50.124 --> 01:17:51.456

as you will live
with this loss

01:19:40.317 --> 01:19:41.683
for the rest of yours.

01:19:55.916 --> 01:19:57.782
But we can
avenge them both,

01:20:00.879 --> 01:20:02.586
as a father

01:20:04.425 --> 01:20:06.132
and a son.

01:20:43.922 --> 01:20:46.084
El Chicano.

01:20:50.304 --> 01:20:52.574

01:21:21.835 --> 01:21:23.576
Cap, where you at?

01:21:23.670 --> 01:21:24.856
Urgent.
Let's get him out of here.

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:27.918
Cap!
The fuck happened?

01:21:28.008 --> 01:21:30.466
Fucking blew us up.
They fucking blew us up!

01:21:30.552 --> 01:21:31.838
Who? Who?

01:21:31.929 --> 01:21:35.843
The cartel.
Fucking Mexicans. Fucking...

01:21:35.933 --> 01:21:37.577
- Let's get you outta here.
- No, I can fucking stand up.

01:21:37.601 --> 01:21:38.717
I can stand up.

01:21:40.521 --> 01:21:42.012
Come on,
come on, come on.

01:21:43.315 --> 01:21:45.853
They took our people, Diego.
They took our people.

01:21:45.943 --> 01:21:47.354
Can we get
a paramedic over here?

01:21:47.444 --> 01:21:50.482
They took my fucking cops.
They took my fucking cops.

01:21:50.572 --> 01:21:52.234
Come on, get him to an
ambulance. Come on.

01:21:52.324 --> 01:21:53.565
I got you, sir.

01:22:23.939 --> 01:22:25.619
<i>Destruction...</i>

01:22:27.401 --> 01:22:28.858

01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:37.317

01:22:39.163 --> 01:22:41.246

01:22:42.416 --> 01:22:46.126
Verdugo will rise

01:22:46.211 --> 01:22:50.546

I'm a friend.

01:34:03.263 --> 01:34:06.051

01:34:14.482 --> 01:34:16.314
Know thy enemy.

01:34:23.408 --> 01:34:24.990

01:35:08.077 --> 01:35:10.194
No, no.
