00:00.751 --> 00:04.272
My name is michael westen.
I used to be a spy until...

00:04.966 --> 00:07.512
We got a burn notice on
you. You're blacklisted.

00:07.554 --> 00:09.932
When you're burned,
you've got nothing -

00:10.016 --> 00:12.603
No cash, no credit,
no job history.

00:12.687 --> 00:15.024
You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.

00:15.066 --> 00:17.069
Where am i? Miami.

00:17.152 --> 00:20.282
You do whatever
work comes your way.

00:20.366 --> 00:22.911
You rely on anyone who's
still talking to you.

00:22.995 --> 00:26.249
A trigger-Happy ex-Girlfriend...
should we shoot them?

00:26.250 --> 00:28.754
...an old friend who used to
inform on you to the fbi...

00:28.837 --> 00:31.133
you know spies
- A bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:31.174 --> 00:33.637
...family, too... hey,
is that your mom again?

00:33.720 --> 00:35.807
...if you're desperate. Someone
needs your help, michael.

00:35.890 --> 00:38.311
Bottom line
- As long as you're burned,

00:38.394 --> 00:40.294
You're not going anywhere.

00:45.739 --> 00:47.951
It's dangerous to
say no to a spy.

00:48.034 --> 00:50.830
In a business where
motives are questionable

00:50.914 --> 00:52.680
And loyalty is skin-Deep,

00:52.681 --> 00:54.418
Declining the wrong request

00:54.419 --> 00:56.423
Can earn you a
trip to the morgue.

00:56.506 --> 00:58.635
So if you're asked
to soak in a jacuzzi

00:58.718 --> 01:00.261
By a black-Ops sociopath

01:00.262 --> 01:03.726
Who's paranoid about
listening devices...

01:03.809 --> 01:06.772
you pick out your favorite
trunks and wade in.

01:06.856 --> 01:09.026
Come on in, michael.
The water's warm.

01:16.580 --> 01:18.373
Hot, hot, hot.

01:18.374 --> 01:22.004
Am i being
punished? Not at all.

01:22.005 --> 01:24.133
I just thought we
could use a spot

01:24.175 --> 01:27.639
Where we could talk freely
about our future together.

01:27.722 --> 01:29.851
I like you. You know,
like a friend, but...

01:29.934 --> 01:32.187
You're cute. But
don't interrupt.

01:32.188 --> 01:35.777
My mood's been a bit dodgy sincl
that file i wanted from the chileans.

01:35.818 --> 01:38.740
See, i wouldn't say i failed
as much as your plan failed.

01:38.823 --> 01:41.118
As long as you don't
partner me up again,

01:41.202 --> 01:43.102
You'll get your
file soon enough.

01:43.163 --> 01:46.232
I won't. I've learned
the file's been destroyed.

01:46.245 --> 01:48.118
And i confess my first thought

01:48.119 --> 01:49.965
Was to kill you
and take my leave.

01:49.966 --> 01:52.136
But, no. We must keep
calm and carry on.

01:52.219 --> 01:53.679
Thanks?

01:53.680 --> 01:55.181
I think i've sussed out a way

01:55.182 --> 01:56.851
To get the information
that i need.

01:56.852 --> 01:59.855
I'll leave the details to you
this time, but the gist is this -

01:59.856 --> 02:01.985
You're to steal flight
data for every private plane

02:02.068 --> 02:04.864
Flying in and out of miami
for the next six weeks.

02:05.240 --> 02:08.996
- What are you doing?
- Me? I'm offering you a job.

02:09.038 --> 02:11.624
You do it, you get paid money.
That's all you need to know.

02:11.625 --> 02:14.004
Listen, i don't
like prison food.

02:14.087 --> 02:16.716
Operations that have to
do with flight traffic -

02:16.800 --> 02:20.013
Extremely risky. I need to
know more before i commit.

02:20.097 --> 02:22.517
And i am telling you
that simply cannot be.

02:22.601 --> 02:25.063
This is another
moment ofruth, michael.

02:25.105 --> 02:27.233
Do we have a future
together or not?

02:30.572 --> 02:33.485
- Double my fee.
- The price of ignorance?

02:33.486 --> 02:34.946
The price of privacy.

02:34.947 --> 02:36.873
Fair enough.

02:38.084 --> 02:40.003
Can i get out now?

02:42.000 --> 02:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:51.522 --> 02:54.692
I pushed as hard as i
could, sam. He's not talking.

02:54.693 --> 02:56.947
Well, to be fair,
y's a scheming psycho

02:56.989 --> 02:59.033
Keeping their cards close
to the vest is what they do.

02:59.117 --> 03:00.862
You may have to stay
in the game longer

03:00.863 --> 03:02.382
To find out what he's holding.

03:02.383 --> 03:03.832
I may lose my
seat at the table

03:03.833 --> 03:06.462
If i don't come up with six weeks'
worth of private flight records.

03:06.504 --> 03:09.008
We could try the
faa, the dea...

03:09.091 --> 03:10.634
i was thinking
the coast guard.

03:10.635 --> 03:12.930
Oh, the navy's little
sister. That's a good choice.

03:12.972 --> 03:14.892
How are you gonna get in?

03:15.685 --> 03:17.228
Oh, don't give me that look.

03:17.229 --> 03:20.568
They hire ex-Seals all the time
for homeland security check-Ups.

03:20.609 --> 03:23.404
You could get one of your buddies
To hire you on for a temp gig.

03:23.405 --> 03:25.276
You could get in, out,
no questions asked.

03:25.277 --> 03:27.905
Oh, jesus, mike, But, you know,
the thing about buddies

03:27.906 --> 03:29.205
Is that they're your buddies.

03:29.206 --> 03:31.668
You can't make them unwitting
accomplices to aelony.

03:31.710 --> 03:34.290
Do you have an alternative With a
lower risk of somebody being killed?

03:34.291 --> 03:36.675
[ Si sam. I'm really asking.

03:36.676 --> 03:38.088
I don't want to do this
any more than you do.

03:38.089 --> 03:39.774
All right,
brother, i'll do it.

03:39.775 --> 03:41.285
But i'm getting
an itchy feeling.

03:41.286 --> 03:42.762
You sure that's
from a moral dilemma?

03:42.763 --> 03:45.232
Oh, that's not nice.

03:45.315 --> 03:47.652
Michael: dead bolt was
cut with a blowtorch.

03:47.687 --> 03:49.989
Probably didn't break
in to steal your blender.

04:01.424 --> 04:03.594
Hey, pal. Sorry
about the mess.

04:05.263 --> 04:06.598
Larry, what the
hell are you doin

04:06.599 --> 04:08.469
Well, it's nice to
see you, too, michael.

04:08.470 --> 04:11.648
And, sam! I also see you.

04:11.732 --> 04:14.987
Seriously, pal, We do 20
missions on 3 continents,

04:15.029 --> 04:16.654
And this is how you greet me?

04:16.656 --> 04:18.555
Well, that was before
you faked your own death

04:18.618 --> 04:20.132
And came back without a soul.

04:20.134 --> 04:22.034
Ouch. Little harsh, huh?

04:24.460 --> 04:25.934
Uh, you do kill people
for money, larry.

04:25.935 --> 04:27.339
You know, last time
we said goodbye,

04:27.340 --> 04:28.841
I was staring at you
through a sniper scope.

04:28.842 --> 04:31.430
What made you think i ever
wanted to see you again?

04:31.513 --> 04:34.268
Come on, now.
Don't be like that.

04:34.309 --> 04:37.314
Look, i am not
here to kill you.

04:37.398 --> 04:39.317
He was. I saved your life.

04:41.946 --> 04:43.448
All right, talk.

04:43.449 --> 04:45.619
I'll explain everything
after we get rid of this body.

04:45.661 --> 04:47.287
Now, i've been looking
around this place,

04:47.288 --> 04:48.664
Trying to find
something to stuff him in

04:48.665 --> 04:52.254
So we can carry him out
without spooking your neighbors.

04:52.338 --> 04:54.258
How attached are
you to that couch?

04:55.677 --> 05:00.726
Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com

05:03.355 --> 05:05.017
Would you look at that?
Three to the chest.

05:05.018 --> 05:07.529
He didn't even get a shot off.

05:07.570 --> 05:09.406
I just get better with age.

05:09.407 --> 05:11.827
Uh, mikey, that's a
santa muerte tattoo.

05:11.869 --> 05:13.955
Six tears
- The guy's a pro with half a dozen kills.

05:13.997 --> 05:17.586
Pro? That's kind of generous.
Six is a promising start, i guess.

05:17.670 --> 05:19.840
Larry, why is a hit
man in my apartment?

05:19.923 --> 05:22.886
Well, i think
that juan doe here

05:22.970 --> 05:25.140
Would have preferred
the term "sicario."

05:25.182 --> 05:27.185
A cartel wants me dead?

05:27.268 --> 05:29.480
Not exactly
- So far, it's only the guy

05:29.563 --> 05:32.067
Who runs their
cash-Processing center, carlos.

05:32.109 --> 05:34.989
He sent this fellow, and
he wants his money back

05:35.072 --> 05:37.159
So he won't have
to tell his bosses.

05:37.242 --> 05:40.539
- You robbed the colombians?
- 2 million bucks!

05:42.208 --> 05:44.921
They haul in all this
wrinkled-Up street cash.

05:44.963 --> 05:47.425
Dirty bills
- They got to be cleaned and sorted somewhere.

05:47.509 --> 05:50.889
And then when i heard That these
idiots do it all in the same place...

05:50.972 --> 05:52.892
you used my name to get close.

05:52.976 --> 05:54.679
I'm a burned spy.
I'm here to help.

05:54.680 --> 05:56.313
It's a pretty good
approach, damn it.

05:56.314 --> 05:58.943
I mean, especially with
your dossier attached...

05:59.027 --> 06:02.866
okay.
I admit, we have a situation.

06:02.908 --> 06:04.535
I tried to close the loop,

06:04.536 --> 06:08.208
But carlos wasn't there
when i hit the place.

06:08.291 --> 06:11.338
I killed four guys,
and he is angry.

06:11.380 --> 06:12.798
Mike, i'm just gonna say it.

06:12.799 --> 06:14.718
There's room for
two in that couch.

06:20.394 --> 06:22.648
It's heavy as it is.

06:22.731 --> 06:25.944
Always such a softie.
I love this kid.

06:27.405 --> 06:30.493
Listen, i got the
perfect solution.

06:30.577 --> 06:32.538
We feed this body
to the sharks,

06:32.580 --> 06:34.708
And then you and
i kill carlos,

06:34.750 --> 06:37.337
And i will give you
a brand-New identity.

06:37.379 --> 06:38.881
That's your solution -

06:38.882 --> 06:41.427
For mike to kill a
man and go on the run?

06:41.511 --> 06:42.970
Honestly, michael,

06:42.971 --> 06:45.934
How do you put up with this
guy's constant mothering?

06:46.018 --> 06:48.605
Yes, sam, that is
exactly the plan.

06:48.689 --> 06:50.148
And it will work.

06:50.149 --> 06:52.153
Michael, i have a
whole new network.

06:52.194 --> 06:53.779
Protection, guns, i.D.S.

06:53.780 --> 06:58.496
And you will be
safe under my wing.

06:58.579 --> 07:01.167
You really think i'm
gonna be your partner?

07:02.502 --> 07:04.631
I'm gonna give you 24 hours

07:04.672 --> 07:07.552
To change your mind
and get in touch.

07:07.635 --> 07:11.433
After that, i got to think
about my own liability.

07:11.475 --> 07:14.939
Someone has to clean this up.

07:16.775 --> 07:18.353
You're larry garber now?

07:18.354 --> 07:20.905
Yeah. With the kind
of money i make,

07:20.906 --> 07:22.868
You can't just leave it
laying around the house.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.810
You want to invest,
you need an identity.

07:24.829 --> 07:27.500
And there was this shoe
salesman up in buffalo,

07:27.542 --> 07:29.043
And he was kind enough

07:29.044 --> 07:31.047
To fall on a knife
and give me his.

07:32.341 --> 07:33.794
Think about it.

07:33.795 --> 07:35.695
Call me.

07:37.558 --> 07:39.478
That guy sucks.

07:50.578 --> 07:52.163
Hey, fi. Hey, fi.

07:52.164 --> 07:55.294
Michael, when you asked
if you could come over,

07:55.378 --> 07:57.171
You did not mention sam.

07:57.172 --> 07:58.799
It's nothing i
haven't seen before.

07:58.800 --> 08:01.095
I didn't want to get
into details on the phone.

08:01.137 --> 08:04.225
I have a body in the trunk
of my car, and larry's back.

08:04.267 --> 08:06.095
Oh, and a cartel
wants to kill mike,

08:06.096 --> 08:07.890
If you can take
larry's word for it,

08:07.891 --> 08:10.150
- Which, you know, we can't.
- Damn it, michael.

08:10.151 --> 08:11.652
The last time he was here,

08:11.653 --> 08:13.657
You should have
pulled the trigger.

08:13.740 --> 08:15.868
No more bodies until we
figure out what i'm up against

08:15.910 --> 08:17.154
And we find a place to
store the one we've got.

08:17.155 --> 08:20.117
Fine. You can use my
neighbor's apartment.

08:20.118 --> 08:23.913
The place is
tented for termites.
They're fumigating next week.

08:27.220 --> 08:31.894
Preserving a corpse Is not a
frequent job requirement for a spy.

08:31.977 --> 08:36.568
But if you must, Stashing a body is
a lot like storing high explosives.

08:38.821 --> 08:42.327
Air, water, and
heat are the enemy.

08:42.409 --> 08:45.248
His name is justino valverde.

08:45.290 --> 08:47.836
Not an organ donor, in case
you were feeling guilty.

08:47.919 --> 08:50.215
So far, nobody's called him.

08:50.298 --> 08:52.301
Fi and i can track down where
he lives and check it out.

08:52.385 --> 08:55.973
Probably not a good idea For you to
show your face around cartel central.

08:56.008 --> 08:58.185
Right. I'll lay low
and dig in to his phone.

08:58.269 --> 09:00.314
I guess i got to go
by and alert my mom.

09:00.397 --> 09:01.940
Nate, too.

09:01.941 --> 09:07.325
You forgot your brother was
coming into town, didn't you?

09:07.408 --> 09:09.620
Nate: meet mrs. Nate westen.

09:09.704 --> 09:11.749
Nate, you're married? Yep!

09:11.832 --> 09:15.296
Me and ruth pulled the
trigger tuesday in vegas.

09:15.338 --> 09:17.842
Welcome to the
family, new bro!

09:17.883 --> 09:20.137
Your brother is so amazing!

09:20.179 --> 09:23.225
We met last month at
my blackjack table,

09:23.309 --> 09:26.856
And six decks with
him, and i was done.

09:28.776 --> 09:32.991
Surprise, right? They just
arrived just a little while ago,

09:33.074 --> 09:35.411
And i
- It still hasn't sunk in.

09:35.453 --> 09:36.989
This is great.

09:36.990 --> 09:38.540
Wow.

09:38.541 --> 09:42.923
To nate and ruby.
Ruth. Ruth.

09:42.965 --> 09:44.800
Nate.

09:44.801 --> 09:48.348
- God, she's incredible, right?
- She is. Yeah.

09:48.432 --> 09:51.269
- I have a problem.
- Yeah, well, there's a shocker.

09:51.270 --> 09:52.973
I need you to stay
here and watch mom.

09:52.974 --> 09:54.357
Are you kidding me? No!

09:54.358 --> 09:56.570
No, dude, this is,
like, my honeymoon, bro.

09:56.653 --> 09:59.199
You want me to subject
ruth to that right away?

09:59.282 --> 10:02.703
I can appreciate that, but i really need
you to keep an eye out. Larry's in town.

10:02.704 --> 10:04.686
Dead larry? The
assassin? Take this.

10:04.721 --> 10:06.669
Don't tell mom.
She'll freak out.

10:06.711 --> 10:08.630
I'm freaking out.

10:08.672 --> 10:12.094
All right, fine. But you
got to check in... often.

10:12.178 --> 10:14.306
Thank you. I mean that.

10:14.389 --> 10:16.309
You really know how
to kill a buzz, bro.

10:16.810 --> 10:18.771
I have to go, but
congratulations!

10:18.813 --> 10:20.231
The two of you! Wow!

10:20.232 --> 10:23.404
Michael, don't you da-

10:23.445 --> 10:27.076
Sam: so, my cop buddy says This house
has gotten some noise complaints recently.

10:27.118 --> 10:31.124
Bunch of young guys. Probably
sicarios waiting around between hits.

10:31.166 --> 10:33.336
It's sort of like a frat
house for cartel soldiers.

10:33.420 --> 10:35.924
It looks like they installed
the security cameras themselves.

10:36.007 --> 10:37.564
Coax coming from the inside -

10:37.565 --> 10:39.094
There must be
more in the house

10:39.095 --> 10:41.015
So the bosses can keep
an eye on these guys.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.976
And somebody forgot
to pay the gardener.

10:43.018 --> 10:44.918
Lucky us.

10:47.066 --> 10:50.447
Sometimes, the least-Secure
parts of a security system

10:50.530 --> 10:53.368
Are the security
cameras themselves.

10:53.451 --> 10:55.203
If leaves obstruct the lens

10:55.204 --> 10:58.125
Because the landscaping
hasn't been maintained,

10:58.167 --> 11:00.170
You can approach
from a blind spot.

11:06.722 --> 11:10.812
And if you get close enough,
borrowing the video feed

11:10.896 --> 11:13.608
Is as easy as
stealing pay-Per-View.

11:17.573 --> 11:19.618
This week on
"casa de sicario,"

11:19.659 --> 11:22.748
The killers sleep late
and eat cereal for lunch.

11:22.789 --> 11:24.493
Hey, you okay with
the first shift here?

11:24.494 --> 11:25.918
I have to go exploit a friend

11:25.919 --> 11:27.923
In the name of an unsanctioned
national security operation,

11:27.964 --> 11:29.864
And i don't want to be late.

11:29.884 --> 11:32.972
Helping michael with
gilroy. Have fun.

11:33.056 --> 11:34.956
Yeah, define "fun."

11:39.775 --> 11:41.485
Hey, sam.

11:41.486 --> 11:43.154
That gilroy bastard
better be worth it.

11:43.155 --> 11:45.055
You already got the stuff
from the coast guard?

11:45.068 --> 11:46.503
Yeah. And i feel
like crap about it.

11:46.504 --> 11:47.905
I'm pimping my seal
ink down here, mike.

11:47.906 --> 11:50.499
It's disgusting.
No more favors like this.

11:50.500 --> 11:53.296
And if your job goes sideways
and blows back on my friend,

11:53.338 --> 11:55.675
You and me, we're gonna
have some problems, pal.

12:01.559 --> 12:04.355
Justino's phone's a
dry well. Brand-New.

12:04.439 --> 12:07.736
His only calls were his
grandma and a pizza place.

12:08.487 --> 12:10.364
You got here just in time.

12:10.365 --> 12:12.910
We're meeting a
mysterious new character.

12:12.994 --> 12:14.412
Some kind of boss type.

12:14.413 --> 12:16.333
Showed up about
five minutes ago.

12:16.368 --> 12:18.012
I don't like him so far.

12:18.013 --> 12:19.913
He's kind of a sourpuss.

12:20.714 --> 12:22.550
So...

12:22.551 --> 12:24.637
just met nate's wife.

12:26.390 --> 12:27.989
There's a mrs. Nate westen?

12:27.990 --> 12:29.519
Blackjack dealer he just met.

12:29.520 --> 12:32.024
The whole thing seems
pretty well thought out.

12:33.985 --> 12:35.570
Well, i say good for
nate. Good for him.

12:35.571 --> 12:37.024
You know, life is short.
You got to grab it by the -

12:37.025 --> 12:40.162
I should take this. Looks like
boss man's texting the dead guy.

12:40.197 --> 12:42.332
Is it coded?

12:42.415 --> 12:44.627
Kind of. It's in spanish.

12:44.669 --> 12:47.799
Look, if it was in
russian or farsi, i -

12:49.635 --> 12:52.390
"What's taking so long?"

12:52.473 --> 12:55.061
Okay, mystery solved.

12:55.102 --> 12:57.022
I guess this is the
guy who wants you dead.

13:00.778 --> 13:04.283
Ooh. He called him a pendejo.

13:04.367 --> 13:07.914
That's like idiot, but ruder.

13:07.956 --> 13:09.876
It says to hurry up with you,

13:09.917 --> 13:12.880
Get over to finish the
job at the hotel victor.

13:12.922 --> 13:15.676
Sounds like larry
forgot to mention

13:15.718 --> 13:17.638
I'm not the only target.

13:27.570 --> 13:29.490
You look upset.

13:30.825 --> 13:32.445
So, who's carlos
gunning for here?

13:32.446 --> 13:33.954
He's my front man.

13:33.955 --> 13:35.450
I hired a guy to
drop your name.

13:35.451 --> 13:36.876
You'd have done
the same thing.

13:36.877 --> 13:39.005
He's a disposable
part-Time hustler.

13:39.089 --> 13:42.176
You're working with an amateur?
Amateur criminal.

13:42.177 --> 13:45.265
Professionally, he's a
magician, like for kids' parties.

13:45.307 --> 13:47.226
Great card tricks.
Great smile.

13:47.268 --> 13:48.728
Jack fleetwood.

13:48.729 --> 13:50.606
Real name's yablonski.
Not too bright.

13:50.607 --> 13:53.027
Sleeps with the manager
here, so he stays for free.

13:53.069 --> 13:54.904
I'm surprised he's
still breathing.

13:54.905 --> 13:56.805
Well, i was gonna
take care of him later.

13:59.705 --> 14:01.605
Ah, "tu air-Es"...

14:01.638 --> 14:03.538
"Tu airs"... "eries"?

14:03.544 --> 14:06.465
Oh...you have lived
in miami for how long?

14:06.549 --> 14:09.553
He's calling him a pen-

14:09.637 --> 14:11.890
Her line of text, fter a
blank line.This but ruder.

14:11.974 --> 14:16.648
And he's saying he is
sending some more guys over

14:16.690 --> 14:18.985
To clean things up.

14:19.069 --> 14:22.866
Oh, look. Nature's taking
its course. We can just relax.

14:22.950 --> 14:25.328
Relax? You think i want a
police investigation into this?

14:25.412 --> 14:26.663
My name is attached.

14:26.664 --> 14:28.959
I told you i could give
you a new name, michael.

14:29.043 --> 14:31.213
Why bother saving
some poor schmuck?

14:36.221 --> 14:38.121
Coming.

14:41.771 --> 14:43.691
Nina, nina, nina.

14:45.110 --> 14:47.864
Whoa. Michael. Hey,
what's going on?

14:47.906 --> 14:49.115
I'm michael.

14:49.116 --> 14:51.203
Okay, two michaels.
What's going on?

14:51.244 --> 14:53.574
We'll explain later. I just need
you to get dressed, right now.

14:53.575 --> 14:54.749
Why?

14:54.750 --> 14:56.126
A colombian drug
cartel wants you dead.

14:56.127 --> 14:57.754
They're sending a couple
of guys over to kill you.

14:57.755 --> 15:00.801
What?! Is this about those
latin guys you had me talk to?

15:00.843 --> 15:02.379
Didn't i just say
i'll explain later?

15:02.380 --> 15:03.882
They're here. No,
no, no, no, no.

15:03.883 --> 15:06.100
No more bodies.
You got a better idea?

15:06.101 --> 15:07.888
Does this room
have a pool view?

15:07.889 --> 15:09.789
Yeah.

15:22.210 --> 15:24.589
I said a better idea!

15:24.672 --> 15:26.424
Just climb over there
- It's safe. Just hit the mattress.

15:26.425 --> 15:28.325
If you stay on this floor, they
will hunt you down and kill you.

15:32.059 --> 15:35.565
The key to surviving a
fall into shallow water

15:35.606 --> 15:38.653
Is safely displacing
your body's mass.

15:42.075 --> 15:44.162
A flat surface floating on top

15:44.203 --> 15:47.417
Can help absorb and
distribute your weight evenly.

15:47.500 --> 15:49.754
Miss the target...

15:49.837 --> 15:51.966
and you may as well be
jumping right onto concrete.

15:52.007 --> 15:54.678
Ohh! I think i broke my foot!

16:00.479 --> 16:02.379
Crazy, huh?

16:10.203 --> 16:11.621
Why would you bring him here?

16:11.622 --> 16:13.248
I want that nut
job out of my house!

16:13.249 --> 16:15.419
It's not like he didn't
already know your address.

16:15.461 --> 16:17.123
Why would that make
me feel better?!

16:17.124 --> 16:18.548
If i let him out of my sight,

16:18.549 --> 16:20.449
That's when he starts
killing everyone.

16:21.888 --> 16:23.549
I really think, uh,
it would be better

16:23.550 --> 16:25.177
If i kept this
elevated on the bed.

16:25.178 --> 16:26.686
Forget it, houdini.

16:26.687 --> 16:29.233
That is a hungarian
goose-Down duvet.

16:29.275 --> 16:30.818
Listen, michael, i...

16:30.819 --> 16:34.700
i apologize about
all this cartel stuff.

16:34.783 --> 16:38.539
But can you help me out?
'Cause i'm really confused.

16:38.581 --> 16:40.563
Jack, you and i
have a problem.

16:40.598 --> 16:42.546
This guy, carlos,
you talked to,

16:42.629 --> 16:46.510
He thinks we robbed
him of $2 million

16:46.594 --> 16:47.921
And killed four
of his friends.

16:47.922 --> 16:50.517
Hmm.

16:50.600 --> 16:53.313
So, we need to convince him
that somebody else did it,

16:53.354 --> 16:55.358
Preferably somebody
who's already dead

16:55.441 --> 16:57.486
So the body count
doesn't go any higher.

16:57.569 --> 17:01.743
We need to convince carlos
this was an inside job.

17:01.784 --> 17:05.915
His own sicario, justino
valverde, robbed him.

17:05.958 --> 17:11.425
And this is something you're...
hopefully really good at.

17:11.465 --> 17:13.343
We zero out justino's
bank account,

17:13.344 --> 17:15.932
Buy some conflicting airline
tickets, some clothes -

17:16.015 --> 17:18.227
It'll look like this
guy stole carlos' money

17:18.310 --> 17:20.314
And is about to skip
town with the cash.

17:20.356 --> 17:22.275
Got it.

17:22.693 --> 17:24.863
He didn't. It's
like an illusion.

17:28.285 --> 17:29.988
I'm starting to
regret saving his life.

17:29.989 --> 17:31.163
Well, he knows too much now.

17:31.164 --> 17:33.501
You can't have the
cartel find him.

17:33.585 --> 17:35.003
W
- What's going on?

17:35.004 --> 17:37.424
You guys making some
kind of decision?

17:50.111 --> 17:52.031
Orchestrating a fake sighting

17:52.072 --> 17:54.368
Isn't a job that
calls for subtlety.

17:54.409 --> 17:55.911
It's not enough

17:55.912 --> 17:57.031
To dress an imposter
in the right clothes.

17:57.032 --> 17:58.932
Am i doing all right?

18:00.962 --> 18:05.343
Oh, you are doing
just fine, justino.

18:05.385 --> 18:07.213
You're kinky.

18:07.214 --> 18:08.973
And i like it.

18:08.974 --> 18:11.144
You need to make
grand gestures

18:11.186 --> 18:13.857
And attract attention
to colorful details.

18:13.899 --> 18:16.862
Justino here thinks
that his tattoo is sexy.

18:16.903 --> 18:19.366
I think it's
scary. Who's right?

18:19.449 --> 18:20.944
It's santa muerte.

18:20.945 --> 18:22.996
Do it right,

18:23.038 --> 18:24.498
And eyewitnesses
will be lining up

18:24.499 --> 18:26.836
To swear they saw a
dead man buying drinks.

18:28.088 --> 18:29.988
Drinks are on you, my friend.

18:30.049 --> 18:31.815
This round is on justino!

18:31.816 --> 18:33.716
He just inherited a fortune!

18:37.186 --> 18:38.847
You need to get out of town.

18:38.848 --> 18:40.607
Go vacation in the keys.

18:40.608 --> 18:42.945
Go now. And burn the clothes.

18:50.457 --> 18:53.461
Every class of criminal
has their own set of fears.

18:53.545 --> 18:56.049
Usually, the bogeyman
lives in the mirror.

18:56.132 --> 18:58.970
Thieves triple-Lock
their doors.

18:59.054 --> 19:01.724
Embezzlers check their
bank accounts obsessively.

19:01.808 --> 19:04.270
And cartel soldiers get
the hell out of any car

19:04.354 --> 19:06.732
That won't start right away.

19:06.816 --> 19:08.686
Carlos, i'm michael
westen. Good to meet you.

19:08.687 --> 19:10.587
What the hell -

19:13.910 --> 19:15.997
You think i have your money?
That's all the money i have!

19:16.039 --> 19:17.665
You better kill me now.

19:17.666 --> 19:19.495
You know, you're not the first
person to tell me that today.

19:19.496 --> 19:20.705
You think you can rob me, huh?

19:20.706 --> 19:21.672
Me?!

19:21.673 --> 19:23.376
I didn't rob you, carlos!

19:23.377 --> 19:24.896
Your boy justino did.

19:24.897 --> 19:26.346
I never even heard of you

19:26.347 --> 19:29.435
Until i got wind some
cartel lackey wanted me dead!

19:29.518 --> 19:30.686
What?

19:30.687 --> 19:33.441
No. This punk,
jack, he told me -

19:33.483 --> 19:36.237
He told you what
justino said to tell you!

19:36.279 --> 19:37.732
Justino would never betray me.

19:37.733 --> 19:38.907
Really?

19:38.908 --> 19:40.828
I think you might have
a little too much faith

19:40.911 --> 19:42.782
In the bond you share
with a mass murderer.

19:42.783 --> 19:44.374
I got a call, carlos.

19:44.375 --> 19:47.505
Your boy justino was
spotted at the iguana bar

19:47.547 --> 19:48.916
Down on south beach
five hours ago.

19:48.917 --> 19:50.634
Since then, nothing.

19:50.635 --> 19:52.535
He's probably gonna blow town.

19:52.555 --> 19:54.455
Son of a bitch.

19:54.475 --> 19:55.726
If this don't check out -

19:55.727 --> 19:57.918
What are you gonna
do? You gonna kill me?

19:57.953 --> 20:00.109
Find him, carlos. Do
it fast, do it alone.

20:00.150 --> 20:02.612
Trust the wrong sicario again,

20:02.654 --> 20:05.534
And the next time your
car doesn't start...

20:06.911 --> 20:09.415
...you might not be
missing a spark plug.

20:18.054 --> 20:20.432
How do you know that you
don't want to live there?

20:20.516 --> 20:22.268
You've never even
been to vegas!

20:22.269 --> 20:24.188
You have to at least
give it a chance.

20:24.230 --> 20:25.898
I am not some old woman

20:25.899 --> 20:29.071
That you can pack away
into a retirement village.

20:29.113 --> 20:33.203
You do not get to
tell me where to live.

20:33.286 --> 20:35.873
Mom, who said anything
about a retirement village?

20:35.957 --> 20:37.417
I just want you close by,

20:37.418 --> 20:39.379
Someplace where
spies and killers

20:39.421 --> 20:41.591
Aren't crawling out of the
woodwork every other week.

20:41.674 --> 20:42.842
Someplace safe.

20:42.843 --> 20:44.846
Ruth: you know,
vegas is amazing.

20:44.929 --> 20:46.849
The weather is amazing.

20:46.933 --> 20:49.144
Someday, you're gonna
have grandkids there.

20:49.186 --> 20:52.400
Don't you think living
near them would just be...

20:52.483 --> 20:54.383
amazing?

20:57.157 --> 20:59.619
Are you gonna
smoke that in here?

21:10.428 --> 21:12.131
Nt mom to move to vegas?

21:12.132 --> 21:13.766
I want you on my se on this.

21:13.767 --> 21:15.095
Tell her it's too
dangerous here.

21:15.096 --> 21:16.061
She'll listen.

21:16.062 --> 21:17.348
She never listens to me.

21:17.349 --> 21:18.565
Can you at least try?

21:18.566 --> 21:20.569
Give her a minute
to cool down.

21:22.781 --> 21:24.701
Maybe give her a day.

21:30.752 --> 21:33.131
Is this your
card? 4 of spades.

21:33.173 --> 21:35.134
Still no.

21:35.176 --> 21:37.304
Hey, mike.

21:37.346 --> 21:40.267
Mike, you better look at this.

21:40.309 --> 21:41.852
We hgot hundreds

21:41.853 --> 21:44.357
Of individually
logged flights here.

21:44.440 --> 21:47.236
Tail numbers, nav
points, clearance codes -

21:47.320 --> 21:50.074
Everything you need to create
mayhem in the sky for a month.

21:50.116 --> 21:52.787
And chuck finley didn't get this stuff
- Sam axe did.

21:52.829 --> 21:54.163
That's not even the point.

21:54.164 --> 21:56.209
We shouldn't be giving
this stuff to gilroy.

21:56.251 --> 21:57.669
Is this your card?

21:57.670 --> 21:59.715
Oh, for god's sa, man,
it's the 3 of clubs.

22:02.093 --> 22:04.806
Okay, that's not fi, 'cause she went
out for food, like, five minutes ago.

22:13.027 --> 22:14.278
Hey.

22:14.279 --> 22:16.408
Got to hand it to you,
kid, i had my doubts.

22:16.491 --> 22:18.027
What are you talking about?

22:18.028 --> 22:19.495
Well, your plan, it worked.

22:19.496 --> 22:21.396
I've been following
carlos all day long.

22:21.457 --> 22:23.000
Come here. Take
a look at this.

22:23.001 --> 22:25.672
There hasn't been anything
this good on at 10:00

22:25.714 --> 22:27.341
Long time.

22:27.342 --> 22:29.261
Wow, look at him
trashing that place.

22:29.303 --> 22:31.203
Justino's no that
couch, my friend.

22:34.812 --> 22:37.740
Larry!

22:37.775 --> 22:40.237
Come on. Enough!
You're not killing him.

22:40.279 --> 22:42.950
You don't get it, do
you? Your plan worked!

22:42.991 --> 22:46.205
It's time to dump justino
and this chucklehead

22:46.288 --> 22:49.084
On carlos' front
stoop and walk away!

22:49.126 --> 22:51.026
Put the knife down,
larry. Or what?

22:51.060 --> 22:52.960
Your trigger finger
has rusted off!

22:54.092 --> 22:55.774
What the hell was that?!

22:55.775 --> 22:57.388
Sam: hey, he warned you.

22:57.389 --> 22:59.726
And, look, there's not
gonna be any more blood -

22:59.810 --> 23:01.096
Just as soon as your
hand stops dripping.

23:01.097 --> 23:03.774
I am not talking
to you, boy scout!

23:03.858 --> 23:05.819
This is my show, larry,
and i need him alive.

23:05.861 --> 23:08.532
He's gonna point carlos
to the money you stole!

23:08.615 --> 23:10.911
You think i'm giving
up 2 million bucks now?

23:12.997 --> 23:15.334
Yeah, i do.

23:30.942 --> 23:34.031
The key to fake surveillance
is delivering real boredom.

23:34.114 --> 23:35.490
If someone suffers

23:35.491 --> 23:37.578
For the information
you're feeding them,

23:37.661 --> 23:38.864
They're much more
likely to belive it.

23:38.865 --> 23:40.540
Can i get one of
them chips, man?

23:40.541 --> 23:42.441
What's "no" in spanish?
It's still "no," right?

23:44.130 --> 23:45.750
You didn't tell me we
were gonna be here all day.

23:45.751 --> 23:46.883
I'm hungry.

23:46.884 --> 23:48.784
Why don't you just
go snatch his ass?

23:48.804 --> 23:51.224
Yeah, how'd that work out
for you last time, genius?

23:51.266 --> 23:52.969
I told you
- Jack's too protected.

23:52.970 --> 23:54.186
He's had guys watching him

23:54.187 --> 23:56.064
Ever since your boys
missed him at the hotel.

23:56.065 --> 23:58.194
I don't care. We can't just
sit around here all day.

23:58.236 --> 24:00.136
We got to act.

24:08.502 --> 24:09.795
Showtime, buddy.

24:09.796 --> 24:12.133
Just read the script
exactly the way i wrote it.

24:13.301 --> 24:14.552
Listen, listen.

24:14.553 --> 24:15.554
What's up, tino?

24:15.555 --> 24:16.931
He's talking to justino.

24:16.932 --> 24:19.770
The boat slip on grove
isle? Yeah, 5:00's good.

24:19.811 --> 24:21.731
I can be there.
Should i bring a bag?

24:21.773 --> 24:23.673
Maricon is talking
about his cut.

24:24.945 --> 24:26.362
I mean, if you got
it all with you,

24:26.363 --> 24:28.234
You got to let me take
a look at the whole pile.

24:28.235 --> 24:30.745
I mean, i bet it barely
fits in the trunk.

24:30.787 --> 24:32.707
Oh, that's beautiful, amigo.

24:32.742 --> 24:33.874
All right.

24:33.875 --> 24:35.537
When justino shows
up at his meeting,

24:35.538 --> 24:37.438
He's gonna be so dead.

24:43.057 --> 24:44.433
Fi, we're on.

24:44.434 --> 24:47.898
If you've been procrastinating,
you can't anymore.

24:47.981 --> 24:50.318
We got the money in the
trunk. Just waiting on justino.

24:50.360 --> 24:53.657
Tell michael the next time
he asks me for a favor,

24:53.740 --> 24:56.828
I'm gonna ask him what
it is before i say yes.

24:56.912 --> 25:01.252
Larry: fiona, don't
shoot. I let myself in.

25:01.294 --> 25:03.080
What the hell are
you doing here?

25:03.081 --> 25:04.297
Just gonna go out on a limb

25:04.298 --> 25:05.877
And guess you've never
dressed a corpse before,

25:05.878 --> 25:07.052
So i'm here to help.

25:07.053 --> 25:08.953
I'm not interested in
- Oh, come on.

25:08.966 --> 25:10.432
Let me put it another way.

25:10.433 --> 25:12.603
If this job goes south
because you screwed up,

25:12.645 --> 25:14.098
Everybody is gonna end up...

25:14.099 --> 25:15.999
very sad.

25:18.279 --> 25:20.072
Here, hand me that shirt.

25:20.073 --> 25:23.746
It's a hell of a lot easier
when you stitch 'em in.

25:23.829 --> 25:25.247
Your mother must be so proud.

25:25.248 --> 25:28.378
You're gonna pretend that we
have nothing in common, huh?

25:29.797 --> 25:32.468
We both have certain capacities
and certain appetites,

25:32.552 --> 25:34.596
And that is how we
connect with michael.

25:34.680 --> 25:37.393
You don't know the first
thing about michael.

25:37.476 --> 25:39.938
Sometimes, you're
just what he needs.

25:40.022 --> 25:43.068
And then sometimes,
he pushes you away.

25:47.450 --> 25:49.453
Uh, do those have
cucumber in them?

25:50.497 --> 25:51.831
I'm allergic. Oh.

25:51.832 --> 25:54.920
Well, i have cold
cuts in the fridge.

25:54.962 --> 25:56.672
No. I thought i told you.

25:56.673 --> 25:58.885
I'm trying to stay
away from protein.

26:01.222 --> 26:04.978
Mom, um, i'd like to
talk about vegas again.

26:05.061 --> 26:06.604
Oh? What about what i want?

26:06.605 --> 26:08.525
Does that matter
in this discussion?

26:08.567 --> 26:10.987
I think what
nate's trying to say

26:11.071 --> 26:12.739
Is you might feel better.

26:12.740 --> 26:16.204
We all might feel better, maybe,
if you were someplace safer.

26:16.246 --> 26:18.917
Like 3,000 miles away safer?

26:20.085 --> 26:23.841
Oh, look! Cucumber salad.

26:23.883 --> 26:26.846
I'm sorry that i'm late
and that i can't stay.

26:26.888 --> 26:28.807
Michael, can i talk
to you for a minute?

26:34.191 --> 26:37.738
I just had a visit from
your old pal, larry.

26:37.822 --> 26:39.490
Okay, don't believe
everything he says.

26:39.491 --> 26:41.411
He said thatd together
for three years.

26:41.452 --> 26:42.870
That's true,

26:42.871 --> 26:44.282
But the government thought
we were a good team -

26:44.283 --> 26:47.545
After all you saw him do...

26:47.629 --> 26:49.924
i don't know how you can stay
in the same room with him.

26:50.008 --> 26:52.261
I can't be with you right now.

26:52.303 --> 26:55.308
You need help with
carlos, you can ask sam.

26:59.940 --> 27:02.611
Sam: m to celebrate my genius.

27:02.694 --> 27:04.070
I was going blind

27:04.071 --> 27:06.826
Futzing with all that
flight data on my laptop,

27:06.868 --> 27:08.327
So i went old school,

27:08.328 --> 27:10.540
And i figured out which
flight gilroy's after.

27:10.582 --> 27:13.712
All right, every
page is a flight plan.

27:13.795 --> 27:16.341
This is every flight today.

27:16.424 --> 27:20.347
It's like pick-Up sticks.
It's all criss-Cross.

27:20.431 --> 27:22.099
It's a big cluster,

27:22.100 --> 27:26.065
And every day is exactly
like that except one day.

27:26.148 --> 27:27.316
The 22nd.

27:27.317 --> 27:28.985
Somebody needs a wide berth.

27:28.986 --> 27:31.406
Yeah, you get that when it's
mandated by the government.

27:31.448 --> 27:33.451
This is some kind of
serious black flight, mike.

27:33.535 --> 27:35.175
And i'll bet you
dollars to doughnuts

27:35.176 --> 27:36.782
This is what gilroy
is interested in,

27:36.783 --> 27:38.250
And this is all
he's gonna get.

27:38.251 --> 27:41.339
Sam, youprobably right about
which flight he's after,

27:41.422 --> 27:43.843
But he asked for all
of it, every flight.

27:43.926 --> 27:46.138
You think you get to
make this call alone?

27:46.222 --> 27:48.684
I'm on the line here.
My friend is on the line.

27:48.725 --> 27:51.229
Every person on every one of
those planes is on the line.

27:51.271 --> 27:53.650
You said it yourself
- He's only after one flight.

27:53.733 --> 27:55.193
Right, but what is to stop him

27:55.194 --> 27:57.064
From selling the rest
to the highest bidder?

27:57.065 --> 27:58.813
We won't let that happen.

27:58.814 --> 28:00.535
You're right. We won't.

28:00.536 --> 28:02.204
You want this data, mike?

28:02.205 --> 28:04.167
You're gonna have
to steal it yourself,

28:04.208 --> 28:05.974
'Cause i'm not
gonna give it to you.

28:05.975 --> 28:07.838
And, hey, if that
makes me the boy scout

28:07.839 --> 28:09.674
That you and your
friend larry think i am,

28:09.675 --> 28:11.483
Man, i'm okay
with that. Sam...

28:11.484 --> 28:13.305
no, i am not gonna
help you anymore

28:13.306 --> 28:15.518
Until you get your
head out of your ass.

28:15.601 --> 28:17.938
Sam! Hey, you want back-Up
at your meeting with carlos,

28:17.980 --> 28:19.880
Call fi.

28:19.914 --> 28:21.814
Sam!

28:29.165 --> 28:32.420
4:45. Justino got here early.

28:38.554 --> 28:40.724
He won't look so peaceful
when i'm done with him.

28:40.808 --> 28:42.708
What do you think
you're doing?

28:42.721 --> 28:44.598
I'm gonna go pull
his fingers off.

28:44.599 --> 28:46.065
I got to talk to this guy,

28:46.066 --> 28:48.278
See if the rest of my
crew was in on this.

28:48.362 --> 28:50.699
How the hell did you get
put in charge of anything?

28:50.782 --> 28:52.994
We're not getting within
100 yards of that guy.

28:53.036 --> 28:54.955
You don't know what
kind of backup he has.

28:57.751 --> 28:59.671
What hell is that
doing in my trunk?

29:01.800 --> 29:04.137
When we know he's alone, we'll go
down there and collect your money.

29:04.178 --> 29:06.098
Then you can do whatever
you want to his fingers.

29:06.140 --> 29:07.259
Hold on, hold on,
no, no, no, no.

29:07.260 --> 29:08.517
He robbed me, okay.

29:08.518 --> 29:09.930
He killed my men.
Give it to me.

29:09.931 --> 29:11.015
I get the honors.

29:11.016 --> 29:12.916
Don't miss.

29:16.698 --> 29:18.598
You see what you
get, pendejo?!

29:25.462 --> 29:26.922
It's all here.

29:26.923 --> 29:30.553
I guess i got to let
you off the hook, huh?

29:30.595 --> 29:31.943
So, we're good?

29:31.944 --> 29:33.223
We're great.

29:33.224 --> 29:35.311
Large amounts of cash
present a huge temptation...

29:35.353 --> 29:36.729
oye.

29:36.730 --> 29:40.361
...to steal, to kill
for, to counterfeit.

29:40.402 --> 29:42.001
There's no security
strip, no thread.

29:42.002 --> 29:43.566
Are you trying to
pull something? Huh?

29:43.567 --> 29:44.908
Were you in on this?

29:44.909 --> 29:46.035
That doesn't make any sense.

29:46.036 --> 29:47.830
You run a
cash-Processing center.

29:47.831 --> 29:50.001
Why would i shove monopoly
money in your face?

29:50.084 --> 29:52.254
Don't be stupid.
Put the gun away.

29:52.338 --> 29:54.173
I ain't got to let you
call me stupid no more!

29:54.174 --> 29:57.554
Justino must have been trying
to screw his partner over!

29:57.638 --> 29:59.139
This is not my fault!

29:59.140 --> 30:00.850
It's your fault i
can't have him alive!

30:00.851 --> 30:02.722
I can't ask him where
he hid the real money!

30:02.723 --> 30:04.623
I can find the money,
and you know it.

30:07.403 --> 30:09.303
You shoot me,
it's gone forever.

30:10.867 --> 30:13.121
You got one day to come up wit

30:13.204 --> 30:14.580
You put it in the
trunk of a car.

30:14.581 --> 30:16.835
You park it by the
airport. You let me know.

30:16.918 --> 30:18.330
You do that, i
take off the hit.

30:18.331 --> 30:20.257
If not...

30:24.096 --> 30:26.141
cabrรณn.

30:33.862 --> 30:36.157
Fiona: this is fi.
Leave a message.

30:36.199 --> 30:37.700
Fi, larry swapped the money.

30:37.701 --> 30:39.405
I don't know where he
is or what he's doing.

30:39.406 --> 30:41.541
Call me back.

30:41.624 --> 30:43.494
Sam: you've reached the
voicemail for sam axe.

30:43.495 --> 30:45.395
Sam!

30:47.175 --> 30:49.094
Larry, what the hell
were you thinking?!

30:49.129 --> 30:50.638
Michael, i'm
sorry you're upset.

30:50.639 --> 30:52.175
I pulled that
last-Minute switcheroo

30:52.176 --> 30:53.434
For your own good, okay?

30:53.435 --> 30:55.221
We should get together.
I need to talk -

30:55.222 --> 30:57.122
You meet at my
loft in one hour,

30:57.149 --> 30:59.611
And if you're not
there, if you try to run,

30:59.695 --> 31:01.698
I will find you,
and i will kill you!

31:11.714 --> 31:12.881
Sorry.

31:12.882 --> 31:14.969
Couldn't walk away
from 2 million bucks.

31:15.052 --> 31:16.442
Not gonna happen.

31:16.443 --> 31:17.764
I need that money.

31:17.765 --> 31:19.977
I'll give you half of it
if you do this my way -

31:20.018 --> 31:21.938
Kill carlos.

31:22.022 --> 31:24.567
My head is on the
chopping block, larry.

31:24.651 --> 31:27.363
You don't think i'll
end you to save myself?

31:27.447 --> 31:28.823
Oh, i know you would.

31:28.824 --> 31:31.161
And that is what i
love about you, kid.

31:31.244 --> 31:35.167
But i'm not the guy who
sent people to end your life.

31:35.251 --> 31:37.630
All you have to
do is kill him.

31:40.467 --> 31:43.681
You're at a fork in
the road. I know you.

31:43.764 --> 31:45.851
This is not a tough call.

31:45.934 --> 31:49.190
Killing carlos does
not solve my problem!

31:49.273 --> 31:51.443
My name
- It's in the air!

31:51.527 --> 31:53.427
I'll give you a new
one. I'll protect you.

31:53.488 --> 31:55.992
You're a shoe
salesman from buffalo!

31:56.075 --> 31:58.329
I have connections.
I have guns.

31:58.412 --> 32:00.499
And i also have
what you need most -

32:00.541 --> 32:01.708
The will.

32:01.709 --> 32:04.422
The will to act
on our instincts,

32:04.505 --> 32:06.926
To get what we want.

32:07.009 --> 32:09.305
And what i want is to
work with you again.

32:09.346 --> 32:11.892
I'll cut the head
off the whole cartel

32:11.976 --> 32:13.876
If that's what it takes.

32:16.191 --> 32:17.734
But you know what's sad?

32:17.735 --> 32:20.698
I don't see anyone else
stepping up to bail you out.

32:23.577 --> 32:26.582
It's do-Or-Die
time, kid.

32:26.624 --> 32:28.544
What's it gonna be?

32:28.579 --> 32:30.003
After a career

32:30.004 --> 32:32.675
Spent doing bad things
for good reasons,

32:32.759 --> 32:35.388
It's hard to say exactly
where you draw the line.

32:35.429 --> 32:37.349
You might not know exactly.

32:38.100 --> 32:40.104
Until someone asks.

32:40.187 --> 32:43.859
I'll kill carlos. You
take care of the rest.

33:01.502 --> 33:03.588
Nate: hey, mike,
open up! It's nate!

33:11.601 --> 33:13.262
There you are.

33:13.263 --> 33:14.890
Not a great time.

33:14.891 --> 33:16.274
Yeah.

33:16.275 --> 33:18.175
Whatever
- You got me watching out for our mom.

33:18.236 --> 33:19.731
You won't even
answer my calls?

33:19.732 --> 33:21.157
What? What do
you mean, "what?"

33:21.158 --> 33:23.058
I wanted to see if there
was anything else i could do

33:23.077 --> 33:24.697
To help with this larry thing.

33:24.698 --> 33:26.290
I left you, like,
three messages.

33:26.291 --> 33:29.963
Turning an asset is
a multi-Step process.

33:30.047 --> 33:33.511
You back them into a
corner, you pile on stress,

33:33.594 --> 33:36.265
You create tension with
the people they trust,

33:36.348 --> 33:38.268
And if you can cut them
off from good influences

33:38.352 --> 33:40.055
So you're the only
voice in their ear...

33:40.056 --> 33:41.522
damn it.

33:41.523 --> 33:43.247
...they're much more
likely to listen.

33:43.248 --> 33:44.944
Did larry
- He knows i check for bugs.

33:44.945 --> 33:46.572
He switched out my sim card,

33:46.573 --> 33:48.618
Used call forwarding,
isolated me.

33:48.701 --> 33:50.704
It's a formula
that works so well,

33:50.788 --> 33:53.375
It even works on spies
who ought to know better.

33:53.417 --> 33:55.379
You really thought no one
was answering your calls.

33:55.462 --> 33:57.882
Jesus, bro. Dad's dead.

33:57.924 --> 33:59.565
You're not in
afghanistan anymore.

33:59.566 --> 34:01.325
I mean, when are
you gonna learn

34:01.326 --> 34:03.226
There are people
you can trust?

34:09.860 --> 34:12.656
Ah, you ever have one
of these cuban coffees?

34:12.697 --> 34:14.993
Cortaditos
- Fun to drink, fun to say.

34:15.076 --> 34:16.286
Cortaditos.

34:16.286 --> 34:17.705
You know, i've been thinking.

34:17.706 --> 34:20.168
If we're going to do this,
i want to be thorough,

34:20.251 --> 34:21.871
Leave no trace,
leave no teeth.

34:21.871 --> 34:22.963
Ooh, that's good.

34:22.964 --> 34:25.134
That's a bumper
sticker. I love that.

34:26.261 --> 34:27.594
Forget shooting carlos.

34:27.596 --> 34:29.496
We're gonna blow
up his cash room.

34:29.516 --> 34:32.353
We'll take the
whole building down

34:32.395 --> 34:34.733
With carlos in it.

34:34.774 --> 34:36.944
If it looks enough
like a car bomb,

34:37.027 --> 34:39.532
The cops will think
rival dealers did it.

34:39.574 --> 34:41.339
No, i get it, i just...

34:41.340 --> 34:43.120
i'm not sure i buy it.

34:43.121 --> 34:46.668
A new violent plan
at the last minute?

34:46.710 --> 34:49.380
What happened
to saint michael?

34:49.464 --> 34:50.958
People don't change overnight.

34:50.960 --> 34:52.092
Well, i haven't.

34:52.092 --> 34:54.054
That's why i'm
pushing it to 3:00.

34:54.138 --> 34:56.100
It will give me
time to clear out

34:56.183 --> 34:58.249
As many tenants as possible.

34:58.284 --> 35:00.315
Oh, there's the old softie.

35:02.109 --> 35:05.239
I'm kidding. I'm
impressed. I'm impressed.

35:05.323 --> 35:07.368
This is a big step forward.

35:07.451 --> 35:08.702
Are we in business or not?

35:08.703 --> 35:10.323
'Cause if we are, i
want my money fast.

35:10.324 --> 35:11.415
We're gonna have to run.

35:11.416 --> 35:14.420
Relax, relax. I can
get it really quick.

35:14.504 --> 35:16.507
My bags are already packed.

35:16.590 --> 35:17.758
3:00.

35:17.759 --> 35:19.093
Don't be late, larry.

35:19.094 --> 35:21.598
Michael westen back in action.

35:21.682 --> 35:23.582
I wouldn't miss it.

35:29.611 --> 35:31.029
Yeah.

35:31.030 --> 35:34.410
I've said i'm
sorry before, right?

35:34.494 --> 35:36.580
I'm not sure. I need help.

35:36.664 --> 35:39.084
My plan with carlos fell
apart, and i'm scrambling.

35:39.168 --> 35:41.338
I need to find out where
larry stashed his money.

35:41.380 --> 35:43.425
Well, if i were him,
i would keep it close.

35:43.508 --> 35:46.054
But i would want it someplace
where you would look guilty

35:46.137 --> 35:48.037
If he had to bag
out on the job.

35:50.436 --> 35:52.313
Can you meet me at the loft?

35:52.314 --> 35:54.609
Sam, we're gonna
celebrate your genius.

35:57.572 --> 35:59.617
My punching bag.

35:59.659 --> 36:02.037
You know, he actually laughed

36:02.121 --> 36:04.917
When he said, "my
bags are packed."

36:05.000 --> 36:08.130
$2 million. It's all there.

36:08.214 --> 36:10.467
What's next?

36:10.551 --> 36:12.721
I need to apologize.

36:14.432 --> 36:16.560
I should have listened
to both of you.

36:16.602 --> 36:18.062
It's all right, buddy.

36:18.063 --> 36:19.599
You were marked for
death. It got to you.

36:19.600 --> 36:21.500
I know i let larry
get too close.

36:22.445 --> 36:25.700
You let him crawl inside
your head and make a nest.

36:30.457 --> 36:34.088
There's a part of me...

36:34.172 --> 36:35.750
this part that's like him.

36:35.751 --> 36:37.651
But it's just a part.

36:37.719 --> 36:40.640
And it gets smaller
the longer i'm with you.

36:45.982 --> 36:50.155
Well, tell me you're
done with him...forever.

36:50.239 --> 36:52.534
I am. I want him gone.

36:54.913 --> 36:56.813
How can i help?

36:56.874 --> 36:59.420
I need you to help me
make a very special bomb.

37:04.929 --> 37:07.391
Yeah. How did you decide
on the binary liquids?

37:07.433 --> 37:09.853
They're stable, easy
to smuggle as separates,

37:09.937 --> 37:12.315
Exotic enough so the cops won't
know what they're looking at.

37:12.357 --> 37:14.527
It's beautiful, kid.
That is just beautiful.

37:14.562 --> 37:16.697
You know what? We are
gonna have so much fun.

37:17.991 --> 37:19.367
I don't think we will.

37:19.368 --> 37:21.288
I dropped off carlos' money
at the airport this morning.

37:21.330 --> 37:22.998
He called off the hit.

37:22.999 --> 37:24.960
Me and carlos, we're straight.
Well, at least, we're gonna be.

37:25.002 --> 37:26.942
You shouldn't have
done that, kid.

37:26.977 --> 37:28.883
That is not your
money to give away!

37:28.967 --> 37:30.510
What's with the gun, larry?

37:30.511 --> 37:32.172
I let you live, and now you're
gonna feed me to the sharks?

37:32.173 --> 37:34.073
You betrayed me.
You know i will.

37:36.103 --> 37:37.681
You know what?
I don't have to.

37:37.682 --> 37:39.190
I'm just gonna leave you here.

37:39.191 --> 37:41.236
You're gonna be a
smoldering corpse.

37:41.278 --> 37:43.907
What are you talking about?
There's no bomb, larry.

37:46.828 --> 37:48.728
Oh.

37:49.583 --> 37:51.961
You framed him, right.

37:52.045 --> 37:54.048
Nice. And the binary liquid?

37:54.090 --> 37:55.716
Uh, counterfeiting ink.

37:55.717 --> 37:58.221
The laptop is just
full of graphics.

37:58.305 --> 38:01.310
And what was carlos doing with
a bunch of scans of $20 bills?

38:03.313 --> 38:05.650
Probably printing about $2
million worth of fake bills

38:05.692 --> 38:06.984
In this dumpster.

38:06.985 --> 38:08.779
You know what? I
don't get you, kid.

38:08.780 --> 38:11.284
You don't think his bosses
will have him killed in prison?

38:11.325 --> 38:13.329
Carlos made a choice.

38:13.412 --> 38:14.865
He chose to work
for the cartel.

38:14.866 --> 38:16.458
I make my own choices!

38:16.459 --> 38:18.359
I don't kill anyone
unless i have to!

38:18.420 --> 38:20.632
Yeah, well, we are
different that way.

38:20.674 --> 38:22.008
You're not gonna
kill me, larry.

38:22.009 --> 38:25.056
Not when the cops are coming
to talk to larry garber,

38:25.139 --> 38:27.893
The man who called in a report
that he saw men with guns,

38:27.935 --> 38:30.063
A dumpster filled
with fake cash.

38:30.105 --> 38:32.901
Having an identity has
its drawbacks, huh, larry?

38:32.943 --> 38:35.071
You forget who you're
dealing with here?

38:35.113 --> 38:36.573
I faked my own death once.

38:36.574 --> 38:38.444
Sure, but what about
larry garber's investments

38:38.445 --> 38:39.744
And all of his bank accounts?

38:39.745 --> 38:42.708
They'll sit on that money,
and they'll wait for you.

38:42.750 --> 38:44.001
You shoot me,

38:44.002 --> 38:46.214
And all that money
is as good as gone.

38:46.297 --> 38:48.217
You're at a fork in the road.

38:48.252 --> 38:49.677
Go broke and go to jail

38:49.678 --> 38:52.641
Or run from the cartel and
live to fight another day.

38:52.683 --> 38:53.808
I know you, man.

38:53.809 --> 38:55.709
This isn't even a tough call.

38:59.193 --> 39:01.989
There will be
another day, michael.

39:02.031 --> 39:03.365
Let me do you a favor.

39:03.366 --> 39:05.828
I'll take this and
hide it for you.

39:05.912 --> 39:08.249
You're a hero,
larry. Larry garber.

39:10.962 --> 39:12.213
Officer!

39:12.214 --> 39:14.133
Officer, please,
thank you for coming!

39:14.168 --> 39:15.426
Thank you!

39:15.427 --> 39:17.430
This way! Right over
here in the trunk!

39:26.444 --> 39:28.364
Jack: listen, i can't
thank you enough.

39:28.406 --> 39:30.868
You've been so
cool about this.

39:30.910 --> 39:33.831
Jack, remember. You're
no longer jack fleetwood.

39:33.873 --> 39:36.210
You're jack yablonski
again, forever.

39:36.252 --> 39:39.548
Yeah. I'm psyched about that.

39:40.842 --> 39:42.594
Be safe, man.

39:42.595 --> 39:45.767
And, jack, seriously, if
you ever come back to miami,

39:45.850 --> 39:48.396
Or if i ever hear the
name fleetwood again,

39:48.479 --> 39:49.974
I will kill you myself.

39:49.975 --> 39:51.875
Okay? Have a safe trip.

40:00.757 --> 40:03.345
Wish we didn't have
to take off so soon.

40:05.849 --> 40:07.749
It was wonderful having you.

40:10.857 --> 40:13.235
Ruth, wish you
could stay longer.

40:13.319 --> 40:17.701
We do, too, but,
you know, work.

40:17.784 --> 40:19.954
One more day, she was
gonna file for an annulment.

40:19.996 --> 40:21.539
You owe me, bro.

40:21.540 --> 40:23.369
You drive safe. Bye, ruth.

40:23.370 --> 40:25.270
Bye!

40:31.055 --> 40:33.643
So, you sorry i'm
not leaving with them?

40:33.726 --> 40:36.314
Mom, i did not say i
wanted you to leave.

40:36.397 --> 40:39.235
I said if you wanted
to live someplace safer,

40:39.318 --> 40:42.573
Closer to them,
i'd understand.

40:42.615 --> 40:44.325
Well, i'm happy for nate.

40:44.326 --> 40:47.206
It's time that he settled
down and built a life.

40:47.289 --> 40:49.292
But i have mine.

40:49.376 --> 40:51.211
It's here...

40:51.212 --> 40:53.299
with you...

40:53.341 --> 40:55.469
and sam and fiona.

40:57.806 --> 41:00.602
Plus, i can't
stand that woman.

41:12.245 --> 41:14.457
Weighing operational
risk is tricky

41:14.499 --> 41:16.920
When your life is on
one side of the scale.

41:16.961 --> 41:19.799
Withholding flight-Plan data
may put your life in danger,

41:19.883 --> 41:21.426
But you try to remember

41:21.427 --> 41:23.597
That if you jeopardized
thousands of innocent lives

41:23.638 --> 41:25.182
To save your own,

41:25.183 --> 41:27.083
You wouldn't want to
live with yourself anyway.

41:27.144 --> 41:29.940
You're a tad overdressed for
the jacuzzi, don't you think?

41:30.024 --> 41:32.402
Is this your card?

41:32.444 --> 41:35.198
It's blatantly not six
weeks of flight plans.

41:35.240 --> 41:37.369
Just the one that you want.

41:37.410 --> 41:39.246
Chile to poland,

41:39.247 --> 41:42.001
Tail number 4 whiskey
x-Ray alpha 803.

41:42.043 --> 41:45.173
Registered to a faceless
corporation in santiago.

41:45.214 --> 41:47.927
What's so special
about the plane?

41:48.010 --> 41:50.306
What happened to
the price of privacy?

41:50.347 --> 41:52.684
Well, you hired an
operative, not a child.

41:52.768 --> 41:54.813
I need to know what's
going to poland.

41:54.896 --> 41:58.402
Right.

41:58.444 --> 42:01.615
Well, i suppose it's only
natural to be curious.

42:01.657 --> 42:03.952
I'll tell you.

42:03.994 --> 42:07.416
It's a weaponized plague
and a vaccine to match.

42:07.458 --> 42:09.503
And they're worth a
bloody lot of money.

42:09.586 --> 42:12.214
That wasn't so hard, was it?
You're in, then?

42:12.215 --> 42:16.514
Gilroy, i think you and i
have a bright future together.

42:23.567 --> 42:25.467
So, learn anything?

42:25.486 --> 42:27.865
Only that he's
a damn good liar.

42:27.907 --> 42:29.952
Tried to sell me some
line about a bioweapon,
