00:29.800 --> 00:32.610
I feel like taking the forest air.

00:34.960 --> 00:35.960
Join me?

00:41.040 --> 00:42.929
You know there'll be others?

00:45.320 --> 00:46.606
Not like him.

00:50.640 --> 00:52.529
The Chevalier's a traitor.

00:53.360 --> 00:54.725
I had no choice.

00:58.040 --> 00:59.040
Come!

01:00.040 --> 01:02.088
A ride always lightens your mood.

01:17.920 --> 01:20.321
- You could've won!
- You would've lost.

01:20.880 --> 01:22.689
We can't have that, can we?

01:23.600 --> 01:26.365
You should
take the matter less to heart.

01:29.880 --> 01:32.531
You imprisoned my friend.
How should I take it?

01:33.600 --> 01:36.763
The Chevalier
was plotting against the Crown.

01:36.920 --> 01:38.729
How should I take that?

01:38.880 --> 01:39.927
He was trapped.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.240
You know it.

01:42.400 --> 01:44.880
He's gullible, easily influenced

01:45.800 --> 01:46.881
He meant no harm.

01:47.040 --> 01:50.283
The decision was your King's,
not your brother's.

01:51.400 --> 01:52.686
Are you my brother?

01:55.360 --> 01:56.771
Sometimes I wonder.

02:02.760 --> 02:07.561
<i>* I'm the King of my own land,</i>

02:12.440 --> 02:15.728
<i>* Facing tempests of dust,</i>

02:15.880 --> 02:20.681
<i>* I'll fight until the end,</i>

02:24.640 --> 02:30.204
* <i>Creatures of my dreams,
rise up and dance with me,</i>

02:39.040 --> 02:46.849
<i>* Now and forever,
* I'm your King.</i>

03:20.240 --> 03:23.210
- What's happening?
- Her Highness is ill, Sire.

03:23.360 --> 03:26.409
- Is my doctor there?
- I'm going to get her now.

03:27.080 --> 03:30.766
- Her appearance?
- The matter's already in hand, Sire.

03:30.920 --> 03:32.126
Very good.

03:46.600 --> 03:48.443
- Ridiculous!
- It's passable.

03:48.600 --> 03:49.806
Until I speak.

03:49.960 --> 03:52.850
Then you should
speak as little as possible.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.684
I'll be found out right away.

03:54.840 --> 03:57.730
I see why you're anxious,
but it's of little use.

04:16.680 --> 04:19.809
- What happened?
- A miscarriage.

04:24.800 --> 04:26.450
Will she recover?

04:27.000 --> 04:30.288
Yes, Your Highness,
with sleep and repose.

04:37.160 --> 04:38.491
Why did it happen?

04:40.680 --> 04:42.205
I don't know.

04:42.760 --> 04:45.764
Many of nature's secrets
are still a mystery to us.

04:59.280 --> 05:01.681
Our visitor from England arrives today.

05:01.840 --> 05:04.446
Bring him to me quietly and privately.

05:04.600 --> 05:05.806
Yes, Sire.

05:05.960 --> 05:09.089
- Where's Fabien?
- I've been looking, Sire,

05:09.240 --> 05:10.844
but so far without success.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.009
He'll interrogate the Chevalier,

05:13.160 --> 05:16.801
who has a loose tongue,
and certainly a lot to tell us.

05:26.840 --> 05:28.251
You are a fool.

05:29.600 --> 05:33.127
- What do you want of me?
- Your silence.

05:36.440 --> 05:37.885
They're going to hang me.

05:38.040 --> 05:40.805
The King won't kill his brother's lover.

05:40.960 --> 05:44.601
He'll spare you,
but he'll torture you first.

05:45.240 --> 05:48.642
If you talk of our group,
I'll not torture or spare you.

05:48.800 --> 05:52.327
I'll open you
from gullet to groin with a fish knife.

05:52.480 --> 05:55.563
- Is that clear?
- Yes.

06:01.680 --> 06:04.968
All prisoners
involved in the plot are in La Bastille.

06:05.120 --> 06:07.487
We await Mr Marchal to question them.

06:07.640 --> 06:09.847
They'll say whatever will save them.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.889
Are they acting alone,

06:12.040 --> 06:14.566
or is someone else pulling the strings?

06:15.000 --> 06:17.890
You shouldn't worry
about the nobles, Sire.

06:18.040 --> 06:21.249
Apart from the bluster,
they're lazy and cowardly.

06:21.400 --> 06:23.004
Aren't you a noble, Rohan?

06:23.160 --> 06:25.925
My point exactly.
I'm lazy and a known coward.

06:27.040 --> 06:30.408
If I may suggest, Sire,
they should be executed,

06:30.560 --> 06:32.927
that's how to deal with traitors.

06:33.080 --> 06:35.367
- What talk in the salons?
- Scared.

06:35.720 --> 06:38.200
Good, that's how I want it.

06:41.600 --> 06:44.001
I think you should release them, Sire.

06:44.160 --> 06:45.685
Why should I do that?

06:46.480 --> 06:50.246
Because gratitude will make them
obedient and faithful.

06:51.560 --> 06:52.607
Perhaps.

06:53.160 --> 06:57.131
But I'd like them
on a cold prison floor a little longer.

07:08.400 --> 07:09.845
There's nothing to fear.

07:10.920 --> 07:12.445
Don't fight.

07:13.280 --> 07:14.280
Rest.

07:18.440 --> 07:21.364
Rest! Rest, my love.

07:25.880 --> 07:28.167
What did you give me?

07:31.000 --> 07:34.402
A little potion
to add spice to our passion.

07:35.240 --> 07:37.208
I took some too. Remember?

07:42.280 --> 07:43.805
Now close your eyes.

07:44.640 --> 07:46.210
- You need sleep.
- Water!

07:47.320 --> 07:48.685
I need water!

07:48.840 --> 07:52.049
Of course, my sweet. Now don't worry.

07:52.760 --> 07:55.206
I'll stay until you're recovered.

08:02.480 --> 08:05.450
I think you ate something
that disagreed with you.

08:05.600 --> 08:08.490
You did say
the pheasant tasted a little off.

08:08.640 --> 08:10.722
It must've been that, mustn't it?

08:18.520 --> 08:19.521
Fabien?

08:35.120 --> 08:36.530
Has the King visited me?

08:38.360 --> 08:40.885
Please tell him I wish to see him.

08:48.160 --> 08:52.245
He's attending to state matters,
but surely he's thinking only of you.

08:53.760 --> 08:55.330
I didn't see you there.

08:56.320 --> 08:57.321
Come, sit with me?

09:00.240 --> 09:02.607
I see your priorities are unchanged.

09:02.760 --> 09:03.841
Good day.

09:09.840 --> 09:11.888
Did I lose the child?

09:13.440 --> 09:15.329
Yes, Your Highness.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.923
Maybe that's for the best.

09:41.400 --> 09:44.324
His Majesty
will be here shortly, Sir William.

09:44.600 --> 09:47.570
- These are the palace plans?
- Yes, Sir William.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.961
He lacks nothing in ambition.

09:59.520 --> 10:02.285
- Thank you for coming.
- An honor, Your Majesty.

10:10.240 --> 10:12.925
I have a proposition for your King.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.560
I'll hear it with great interest.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.085
This discussion
is to be divulged to no one

10:21.240 --> 10:23.891
but the King and those he trusts.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.246
Of course.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.689
I want to invade Holland.

10:33.440 --> 10:34.646
I see.

10:35.320 --> 10:39.120
Only England,
her principal ally, could stop me.

10:39.880 --> 10:43.771
How could I persuade
England to join me in such a venture?

10:44.440 --> 10:46.681
Money? Possibly.

10:47.120 --> 10:50.841
Dutch trade routes? Almost certainly.
But that's not enough.

10:51.200 --> 10:54.124
What's a gift
for a King who has almost everything?

10:55.360 --> 10:59.490
What his family
so carelessly tossed away: his faith.

11:00.240 --> 11:01.890
Your Majesty, far be it...

11:02.400 --> 11:06.485
He publicly claims to be Protestant,
but at heart he's Catholic.

11:06.640 --> 11:07.801
Let's not pretend.

11:07.960 --> 11:12.249
He seeks renewed relations with Rome,
but in their eyes he's a heretic.

11:12.720 --> 11:14.688
My proposed agreement is simple.

11:15.480 --> 11:18.165
We invade,
England provides some resources,

11:18.560 --> 11:20.688
all costs are borne by France,

11:20.840 --> 11:24.640
I effect a reconciliation
between the English crown and Rome.

11:24.800 --> 11:26.086
Well now...

11:26.240 --> 11:30.040
What better way
to seal an alliance between friends?

11:35.360 --> 11:38.284
I suggest
a meeting 10 days hence at Dover Castle.

11:38.760 --> 11:40.603
You'll come in person?

11:41.800 --> 11:43.450
I haven't yet decided.

12:16.600 --> 12:17.681
Wake up!

12:26.960 --> 12:29.122
Have I been poisoned?

12:33.880 --> 12:35.120
Yes, I believe so.

12:35.280 --> 12:37.282
With what?

12:37.760 --> 12:41.526
Swollen eyes,
marks on the hands, vomiting

12:41.960 --> 12:44.964
when I saw this before,
the cause was arsenic.

12:45.120 --> 12:47.646
- I'll live?
- If I can find an antidote.

12:48.720 --> 12:51.326
But first, herbal salve for your eyes.

12:51.480 --> 12:52.811
You will not.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.287
Then you may lose the sight of both,

12:57.440 --> 13:00.649
a handicap in your profession, no?

13:05.000 --> 13:08.402
No one must know I'm here.

13:10.880 --> 13:11.880
Very well.

13:20.080 --> 13:23.527
I congratulate His Majesty
on his brilliant plan.

13:23.680 --> 13:25.364
Brilliance remains to be seen.

13:25.800 --> 13:28.485
King Charles
must become an ally, not a foe.

13:29.560 --> 13:32.723
Will you go
to the discussions yourself, Sire?

13:32.880 --> 13:36.965
No, they mustn't think
I'm so desperate for their support.

13:37.600 --> 13:41.127
If I may be so bold, Sire,
I'd send FeuquiÃ©re,

13:41.280 --> 13:44.602
an experienced diplomat
who thinks only of France.

13:44.760 --> 13:46.762
Too methodical. Chanut, maybe?

13:46.920 --> 13:49.287
His visit to Sweden
was very successful.

13:49.440 --> 13:51.966
A loose cannon. Croissy, perhaps?

13:52.120 --> 13:53.610
A committed Anglophile,

13:53.760 --> 13:56.001
even rumored to like the food!

13:59.800 --> 14:01.040
Henriette will go.

14:02.320 --> 14:05.369
Your pardon, Sire, did you say ...?

14:05.520 --> 14:06.567
Indeed I did.

14:07.520 --> 14:09.045
Henriette will go.

14:14.160 --> 14:15.764
What does this mean?

14:16.440 --> 14:18.681
Is His Majesty still ill?

14:18.840 --> 14:20.888
Perfectly recovered, thank you.

14:21.680 --> 14:25.810
Sire, with all due respect,
she has no experience in such matters.

14:25.960 --> 14:28.167
The stakes couldn't be higher,

14:28.320 --> 14:30.766
and for all her qualities, she's

14:30.920 --> 14:34.288
A woman?
That hadn't escaped my attention,

14:34.680 --> 14:37.126
with the wit of any here
and courage too.

14:37.280 --> 14:40.443
She's also King Charles' sister.

14:40.600 --> 14:42.204
She knows his weaknesses,

14:43.200 --> 14:45.362
no diplomat has what she has:

14:47.400 --> 14:48.447
his ear.

14:52.120 --> 14:53.804
Your thoughts, Bontemps?

14:55.080 --> 14:59.210
Shouldn't we
consider whether Her Highness has

14:59.360 --> 15:02.887
the strength for such a journey?

15:03.280 --> 15:05.408
Her mind may be willing, but her -

15:05.560 --> 15:07.050
Body is also willing.

15:07.960 --> 15:11.009
- And if we waited a few months?
- We can't.

15:11.760 --> 15:14.604
William of Orange
is now in the Dutch government.

15:14.760 --> 15:18.845
The republicans are retreating,
the House of Orange is on top.

15:19.840 --> 15:21.763
He'll be King within 2 years.

15:22.840 --> 15:25.491
If we don't
negotiate with England, he will.

15:25.840 --> 15:28.366
Louvois, you organize transportation.

15:29.320 --> 15:31.721
Colbert, tomorrow's Gazette will say

15:31.880 --> 15:35.680
that Her Highness
is going to Vichy after a minor illness.

15:44.240 --> 15:45.844
Have you seen Mr Marchal?

15:53.720 --> 15:55.370
Mme De Clermont!

15:57.200 --> 16:00.761
Oh, good afternoon, Madame!

16:01.960 --> 16:03.644
My dear, you seem preoccupied.

16:04.160 --> 16:05.650
Oh, really?

16:05.800 --> 16:09.168
We saw you
the other day with Mr Marchal.

16:09.320 --> 16:10.845
What a handsome couple!

16:11.320 --> 16:14.130
It's true you saw us the other day,

16:14.280 --> 16:19.650
but false that there exists
between us anything but respect.

16:19.920 --> 16:21.251
How disappointing!

16:21.880 --> 16:25.248
Yes, well you see
I lost a necklace some days ago,

16:25.800 --> 16:27.131
a family necklace,

16:27.760 --> 16:31.048
I asked his help to find it,
I feared it was stolen.

16:31.720 --> 16:33.370
- A wise decision.
- Oh, yes!

16:33.520 --> 16:36.444
We're playing cards later.
I hope you'll join us?

16:36.720 --> 16:39.849
Thank you,
but I'm feeling a little unwell.

16:40.200 --> 16:43.283
- Tomorrow, perhaps?
- I'd love nothing more.

16:44.160 --> 16:45.241
Mm-hmm.

16:46.600 --> 16:48.329
Good afternoon, ladies!

17:01.320 --> 17:03.163
This is an honor, Sire.

17:03.320 --> 17:06.368
May I say
how terribly sorry, how ashamed...

17:06.599 --> 17:07.646
Hmm!

17:09.800 --> 17:12.484
Give me one reason why
I should spare your life.

17:13.920 --> 17:15.648
I could not, Sire.

17:16.920 --> 17:18.809
I've betrayed your trust,

17:19.319 --> 17:21.686
allowed myself to be led astray.

17:21.839 --> 17:24.969
I humbly beg your forgiveness.

17:25.119 --> 17:29.205
Perhaps you should tell me
who led you astray.

17:32.120 --> 17:34.407
I cannot, Sire, on my honor.

17:34.560 --> 17:36.642
Your honor?

17:37.440 --> 17:39.442
- A novel concept!
- I swear, Sire,

17:40.000 --> 17:41.764
I've never set eyes on him.

17:41.920 --> 17:44.082
I've no idea
who he is, what he wants.

17:44.360 --> 17:47.170
You think
plotting against me helps my brother?

17:47.480 --> 17:48.845
No, Sire.

17:50.040 --> 17:54.364
I acted
without thought and through fear alone.

17:54.880 --> 17:58.327
I've killed rabbits
with more courage than you.

17:59.960 --> 18:01.121
He deserves better.

18:03.040 --> 18:03.768
Yes, Sire.

18:03.920 --> 18:06.730
The question is,
what to do with you?

18:27.120 --> 18:29.691
Good afternoon.

18:31.720 --> 18:33.927
I must give you
my Paris tailor's name.

18:43.400 --> 18:46.404
- Why are we here?
- I don't know.

18:46.560 --> 18:48.801
- I thought you'd summoned us.
- No.

18:49.120 --> 18:50.121
It was me.

18:51.920 --> 18:53.649
Good news for our cause.

18:53.800 --> 18:57.247
The King's sending Henriette
to see her brother King Charles.

18:57.400 --> 18:58.400
Why?

18:58.480 --> 19:01.563
Whatever the reason,
she won't survive the trip.

19:02.360 --> 19:04.931
- How will you kill her'?
- Leave that to us.

19:05.360 --> 19:08.409
- Then what?
- You'll learn soon enough.

19:09.840 --> 19:12.491
- I say we kill the King.
- Oh, come now.

19:12.640 --> 19:15.530
- I hate the King as much as you.
- I doubt it.

19:15.680 --> 19:19.048
He destroyed your castle.
His father destroyed my family,

19:19.200 --> 19:21.328
as well as thousands of Huguenots.

19:21.480 --> 19:24.848
Mme De Clermont,
first we force him out of power.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.243
Our ally William of Orange
gets stronger every day.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.644
He'll give us the money and men we want.

19:32.240 --> 19:34.402
Go now.
When the time is ripe,

19:34.960 --> 19:38.407
you'll be given
lists of persuadable people at court.

20:17.680 --> 20:19.409
I don't like that woman.

20:21.680 --> 20:22.920
She's dangerous.

20:23.600 --> 20:26.080
We're all dangerous.
Focus on your job.

20:27.160 --> 20:28.161
Very well.

20:30.360 --> 20:33.603
- When does the convoy leave?
- Just after dawn.

20:33.760 --> 20:36.240
There'll be 6 mounted armed guards

20:36.400 --> 20:38.129
and 2 bodyguards with her.

20:38.280 --> 20:40.328
A 2nd convoy will join at Marly.

20:40.480 --> 20:42.721
I'll kill her in the forest, then.

20:42.880 --> 20:45.087
You're sure you can do so?

20:45.800 --> 20:48.087
I know a perfect spot, used it often.

20:48.480 --> 20:49.480
Good.

20:49.600 --> 20:53.047
I've told William
we must strike soon after her death.

20:54.680 --> 20:56.842
- And you trust him?
- I do.

20:57.560 --> 21:01.246
Our ends may differ,
but our means are the same.

21:01.400 --> 21:02.447
Very well.

21:07.120 --> 21:10.806
- Why does the King wish to see her?
- It's not for me to say.

21:10.960 --> 21:13.327
I'm her husband, I've a right to know.

21:13.480 --> 21:16.529
You have a right to ask, not to know.

21:16.680 --> 21:18.648
He's plotting something.

21:18.800 --> 21:21.201
Henriette, let me do the talking.

21:22.400 --> 21:25.131
The King
will talk to Her Highness alone.

21:29.280 --> 21:33.001
Your brother thinks
he's in a strong position. He's not.

21:33.160 --> 21:35.970
He's as weak
or strong as you let him be.

21:36.120 --> 21:39.886
He'll try to bend the treaty his way.
You must be firm.

21:40.360 --> 21:44.524
If he doesn't become our ally,
the agreement's worthless.

21:45.320 --> 21:49.006
Unless he signs,
your mission will have failed.

21:56.480 --> 21:59.450
- What do you want of her?
- I'm sending her away.

22:00.080 --> 22:02.811
- What for?
- To negotiate a treaty.

22:04.080 --> 22:05.241
I don't understand.

22:05.400 --> 22:07.971
She's going abroad as my ambassador.

22:08.480 --> 22:10.767
- Ambassador of France?
- Yes.

22:11.480 --> 22:15.201
- Where?
- I'm not saying and neither is she.

22:19.080 --> 22:20.080
Is this true?

22:33.560 --> 22:35.642
- Don't let him do this.
- Do what?

22:36.000 --> 22:37.240
Use you.

22:38.320 --> 22:40.448
That's what he's doing.

22:41.520 --> 22:42.851
Is that what irks you,

22:43.200 --> 22:46.283
or is it that she has a role
you might've wanted.

22:46.440 --> 22:48.249
What irks me

22:48.640 --> 22:51.450
is that you would take away all that is

22:53.400 --> 22:54.765
or should be mine.

22:57.840 --> 23:00.844
Your friend
the Chevalier is out of prison.

23:01.840 --> 23:04.127
I believe he's in your rooms.

23:14.440 --> 23:18.286
If he betrays me again,
he'll be hanged in public.

23:20.440 --> 23:23.046
I expect you to ensure he does not.

23:36.440 --> 23:39.728
- Are you strong enough to go?
- I believe so.

23:42.560 --> 23:44.324
I'm sorry for your loss.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.001
Our loss.

24:03.840 --> 24:04.966
My darling!

24:10.080 --> 24:14.051
- My return doesn't give you pleasure?
- Only disappointment.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.731
- How so?
- You've betrayed your King.

24:21.080 --> 24:22.080
And me.

24:22.320 --> 24:25.290
- Do I get a chance to explain?
- No.

24:25.440 --> 24:26.521
Very well.

24:26.680 --> 24:29.001
I'll go and find something to eat,

24:29.160 --> 24:30.889
preferably without maggots.

24:33.880 --> 24:35.325
No, stay!

24:42.560 --> 24:44.130
But don't touch me.

24:47.680 --> 24:51.287
If you do it again,
the King will have you hanged.

24:52.080 --> 24:53.320
I will not.

24:54.960 --> 24:56.405
I've learn my lesson.

24:58.520 --> 25:02.002
And the thought
of being hanged in public

25:04.560 --> 25:06.005
I wouldn't let it happen.

25:07.400 --> 25:08.925
Thank you, my love.

25:11.200 --> 25:13.806
I'd kill you myself.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.128
- Message for Mr Marchal.
- Sure.

25:49.040 --> 25:53.090
- Bravo!
- Oh, the luck's all with me today!

25:53.240 --> 25:55.208
- Another game?
- If you insist.

25:55.360 --> 25:57.010
Oh, but I do.

25:57.160 --> 26:01.529
It's tempting to think
you play cards just to humiliate me.

26:01.680 --> 26:03.887
And why would I do that?

26:04.040 --> 26:06.281
Another's suffering gives you pleasure.

26:06.440 --> 26:09.489
I recall
you're something of an expert on that.

26:14.600 --> 26:15.681
Mr Marchal?

26:15.840 --> 26:18.366
He's away. You may give me the message.

26:18.520 --> 26:21.922
I beg your pardon sir,
I only deliver to Mr Marchal.

26:22.080 --> 26:25.323
I'm the king's valet,

26:25.880 --> 26:27.291
give me the message.

26:30.600 --> 26:32.284
- You've come from?
- Pau, sir.

26:45.080 --> 26:46.241
Hmm!

26:53.960 --> 26:55.849
Beatrice, my dear,

26:56.000 --> 26:58.480
you played a spade,
we're playing hearts.

26:58.640 --> 27:03.009
How foolish of me! Oh dear!

27:03.320 --> 27:07.530
- You're from Pau, Beatrice?
- Yes, I am.

27:09.480 --> 27:11.608
- What of it?
- Nothing.

27:11.760 --> 27:14.491
Just,
the messenger said he came from Pau,

27:14.880 --> 27:19.010
and he had information for Mr Marchal.
And I thought of you.

27:19.360 --> 27:21.931
Other people are from Pau.

27:22.720 --> 27:23.767
Surely!

27:26.120 --> 27:27.326
Of course.

27:27.960 --> 27:29.769
A coincidence, I'm sure.

27:31.960 --> 27:32.960
Yes.

27:34.480 --> 27:37.211
What do you know of love potions?

27:37.360 --> 27:39.567
- Love potions?
- Yes,

27:40.120 --> 27:42.361
stimulants for intercourse.

27:43.200 --> 27:44.725
I know what they are.

27:45.520 --> 27:46.851
Why do you ask?

27:48.720 --> 27:53.009
Imagine two people took a love potion.

27:53.160 --> 27:55.731
Imagine this potion contained poison.

27:56.840 --> 28:00.640
How could one suffer from the poison

28:00.800 --> 28:02.689
while the other did not?

28:04.440 --> 28:08.490
Either that person
vomited the poison before it took effect

28:09.320 --> 28:12.130
or took an antidote beforehand.

28:13.400 --> 28:14.890
Hmmm

28:17.160 --> 28:21.051
I want you to send a message
to Bontemps, the King's valet.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.565
I know who he is.

28:23.200 --> 28:27.000
Yes. Tell him I need to see him.

28:29.120 --> 28:30.326
Very well.

28:33.880 --> 28:36.167
You know why you're going to England?

28:36.960 --> 28:39.930
- To test me?
- There's no need for that.

28:41.440 --> 28:45.650
I want you to go because it's your wish,
not to please me.

28:46.440 --> 28:49.569
- There's a difference?
- I don't know. ls there?

28:53.040 --> 28:54.610
Did I do something wrong?

28:55.880 --> 28:59.407
We used to be so close, and now...

28:59.560 --> 29:01.369
Aren't we close now?

29:03.400 --> 29:06.324
I don't know. Are we?

29:11.520 --> 29:13.249
We're close to those we trust.

29:15.400 --> 29:19.325
When you're with your brother,
everything must show self-control.

29:19.840 --> 29:23.162
Walking, entering a room, sitting down.

29:23.760 --> 29:25.330
Betray no emotion.

29:25.480 --> 29:27.403
Silence works better than speech.

29:27.560 --> 29:29.562
When you speak, hold his gaze.

29:29.840 --> 29:31.683
Look away, you've surrendered.

29:32.240 --> 29:34.766
Play on his weaknesses, flatter, charm.

29:35.240 --> 29:39.131
Be strong when you must,
let him win when nothing's at stake.

29:41.240 --> 29:45.325
For this, you're neither
his sister nor my brother's wife.

29:46.440 --> 29:47.601
You are France.

29:49.040 --> 29:50.040
You are me.

29:58.440 --> 30:00.966
Remember our first night together?

30:02.360 --> 30:03.441
Yes.

30:05.480 --> 30:08.609
Remember what I said in the morning?

30:13.480 --> 30:14.561
No.

30:15.240 --> 30:16.526
"Henceforth,"

30:17.640 --> 30:19.802
every day that I don't touch you,

30:20.880 --> 30:22.166
taste you,

30:23.400 --> 30:24.400
feel you,

30:25.720 --> 30:28.803
will be a day of death and mourning...

30:30.240 --> 30:32.481
I meant it then, I mean it now.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.050
I've made a mistake,

30:38.320 --> 30:42.723
I've offended the King
and I've offended you.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.287
But my love's as strong as when we met.

30:55.800 --> 30:58.531
Philippe, the truth is,

31:02.240 --> 31:03.969
if you don't love me,

31:06.280 --> 31:07.645
no one loves me.

31:26.160 --> 31:28.640
I'm so sorry.

31:44.880 --> 31:52.880
It's Montcourt!

32:04.760 --> 32:06.364
What are you doing here?

32:06.520 --> 32:08.488
Good to see you too, Louvois.

32:08.640 --> 32:11.211
You'll be strung up
if the King finds you.

32:11.360 --> 32:12.441
No.

32:12.600 --> 32:16.241
Not when
I give him some information I have.

32:16.400 --> 32:17.686
Of what nature?

32:18.680 --> 32:20.808
Only for His Majesty.

32:21.960 --> 32:24.804
Why would you give it to him?

32:25.440 --> 32:28.603
In exchange
for my return to Versailles.

32:41.480 --> 32:43.005
How did you hear of it?

32:46.280 --> 32:47.691
In a tavern, Sire.

32:47.840 --> 32:50.571
Conversation at an adjoining table.

32:51.560 --> 32:53.528
What exactly did they say?

32:53.920 --> 32:55.763
Only one spoke, Sire.

32:56.240 --> 33:00.325
He boasted he'd kill your brother's wife

33:00.480 --> 33:01.766
on her way to England.

33:06.920 --> 33:08.285
Do you know the man?

33:09.040 --> 33:11.884
Yes, Sire, from a former life.

33:12.760 --> 33:14.285
A thief and a killer.

33:15.880 --> 33:17.405
Where would we find him?

33:20.280 --> 33:22.886
He's part of His Majesty's police force.

33:27.440 --> 33:29.204
He must be arrested.

33:30.600 --> 33:31.761
If I may, Sire,

33:33.600 --> 33:35.443
I'd strongly advise against it.

33:35.840 --> 33:38.286
He'll just deny all knowledge of it.

33:38.720 --> 33:41.087
The only choice
is to catch him red-handed.

33:41.240 --> 33:42.844
How do we do that?

33:43.000 --> 33:44.570
I know his methods.

33:45.400 --> 33:47.482
I know where he'll be.

34:00.760 --> 34:03.809
If this is true,
France will be in your debt,

34:04.640 --> 34:06.642
but 'til then you'll be in custody.

34:07.160 --> 34:10.050
- Do you understand?
- Of course, Sire.

34:24.480 --> 34:26.847
So there's a traitor amongst us.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.650
Sire, wouldn't this be a good reason

34:29.800 --> 34:32.246
to postpone Her Highness' departure?

34:32.520 --> 34:35.284
Losing the chance
to identify my enemies?

34:35.600 --> 34:36.806
No.

34:36.960 --> 34:40.442
Talk to Montcourt.
Find out what he knows.

34:43.360 --> 34:46.204
Mr Marshal's absent,
so security's your job.

34:47.040 --> 34:49.042
I needn't mention the consequences

34:49.199 --> 34:52.409
of the murder
of the King of England's sister.

35:10.760 --> 35:12.444
Mr Marchal wants to see you.

35:13.760 --> 35:16.843
I went to your offices,
there was no one there.

35:17.480 --> 35:19.244
You had an assistant.

35:19.400 --> 35:21.641
I fear we'll not see her again.

35:22.960 --> 35:24.530
What happened to him?

35:24.920 --> 35:26.922
I have a cold.

35:28.640 --> 35:31.325
Who gave you this "cold".

35:33.440 --> 35:36.523
My absence
from court has been noted, I suppose?

35:36.680 --> 35:39.001
His Majesty is less than pleased.

35:39.880 --> 35:42.531
I'd be grateful if you'd tell the King

35:42.680 --> 35:45.729
that I've gone to Paris
on an urgent matter.

35:45.880 --> 35:46.961
Very well.

35:49.080 --> 35:50.605
Before I forget,

35:52.480 --> 35:54.528
I have a message for you.

35:55.440 --> 35:57.602
- From where?
- Pau.

35:58.720 --> 36:01.246
- Have you read it?
- I have.

36:04.240 --> 36:06.561
- She is a liar?
- She is.

36:07.480 --> 36:11.087
The real Mme De Clermont
died in a fire 10 years ago.

36:12.160 --> 36:14.162
What made you suspect her?

36:15.240 --> 36:16.240
<i>Paper.</i>

36:17.040 --> 36:18.326
I don't follow.

36:19.560 --> 36:21.483
Her documents of proof were

36:22.160 --> 36:26.245
dated 30 years before the paper
they were written on was made.

36:27.120 --> 36:28.610
The weave was modern.

36:29.120 --> 36:31.122
Older paper has more fiber.

36:31.560 --> 36:33.722
The ink bleeds differently.

36:33.880 --> 36:35.769
How can you possibly know this?

36:35.920 --> 36:37.843
My father was a printer.

36:44.120 --> 36:45.884
You didn't have her arrested?

36:49.160 --> 36:51.686
I doubted my own convictions,

36:51.840 --> 36:53.604
I'll not do so again.

36:54.200 --> 36:58.046
- You can still say no.
- I want to go.

36:58.200 --> 37:01.090
- But why?
- Because he asked me to.

37:01.240 --> 37:03.163
He didn't ask. He ordered.

37:04.000 --> 37:07.004
I'm pleased
to serve the King and France.

37:07.680 --> 37:09.045
You won't win him back.

37:10.080 --> 37:11.445
You know that?

37:16.560 --> 37:18.210
That's not my intention.

37:28.480 --> 37:30.562
I wish you a comfortable journey.

38:08.440 --> 38:11.569
What are you doing?
I can't leave Her Highness.

38:11.720 --> 38:13.768
Reminding you to take care.

38:13.920 --> 38:15.729
What - what do you mean?

38:15.880 --> 38:19.248
There are dangers everywhere.
Understand?

38:19.400 --> 38:22.324
We're heavily guarded
in complete security.

38:23.080 --> 38:24.127
But if not,

38:24.280 --> 38:27.727
put your own safety
before that of Her Highness.

38:27.880 --> 38:30.850
- What...
- Enjoy your time in England.

38:31.240 --> 38:34.130
England? I'm going to Vichy.

38:59.520 --> 39:01.124
I admire her.

39:02.040 --> 39:03.087
Why?

39:03.920 --> 39:06.207
For going away when she's ill.

39:08.040 --> 39:09.929
She's going away to get better.

39:10.640 --> 39:13.291
- Don't you read the papers?
- Of course.

39:13.720 --> 39:17.247
She's going to Vichy. So silly of me.

39:21.600 --> 39:25.605
I'm honored that His Majesty
chose to see me last night.

39:25.760 --> 39:28.081
I'd worried that I'd lost his favour.

39:29.400 --> 39:32.722
You'll have to try a bit harder
to lose my favour.

40:40.720 --> 40:44.805
- Do you know who killed my father'?
- No, but I'm close.

40:49.560 --> 40:51.369
This eye's well recovered.

40:53.080 --> 40:56.084
The left still has signs of the poison.

40:59.160 --> 41:00.286
What do you see?

41:01.440 --> 41:02.601
The truth.

41:17.480 --> 41:20.006
The assassin's been caught, Sire.

41:32.920 --> 41:35.048
Mr Gruaud, you're a magician.

41:35.200 --> 41:36.850
Hmmm?

41:38.400 --> 41:39.561
Try it! Try it!

41:40.080 --> 41:44.085
It's the perfect blend
of sturdiness and refinement.

41:50.560 --> 41:53.689
Ah! My good friend Montcourt!

41:54.240 --> 41:56.527
I banished this man from court,

41:57.080 --> 41:58.764
never to see him again.

41:58.920 --> 42:01.810
I welcome him back with open arms,

42:01.960 --> 42:03.803
a shining example to all,

42:03.960 --> 42:07.442
and proof that fidelity has its rewards.

42:08.200 --> 42:10.726
- Bravo, Your Majesty!
- Bravo! Bravo!

42:29.400 --> 42:32.244
- My friend!
- What are you doing here?

42:34.000 --> 42:35.365
It's my home.

42:36.080 --> 42:39.402
How did you gain the King's forgiveness?

42:39.560 --> 42:41.483
I begged him for it,

42:41.640 --> 42:45.884
saying life away
from Versailles wasn't worth living.

42:46.880 --> 42:49.486
What about our other activities?

42:52.040 --> 42:54.725
We'll talk about this in private.

42:55.360 --> 42:59.285
Excuse me,
I must say hello to some old friends.

43:06.600 --> 43:08.284
You have a choice:

43:09.760 --> 43:12.161
reason or violence.

43:20.240 --> 43:22.208
Let us begin with reason.

43:23.640 --> 43:25.085
What's your name?

43:26.960 --> 43:28.121
I forget.

43:33.320 --> 43:36.290
On whose orders
did you try to kill her?

43:38.520 --> 43:39.885
You won't believe it

43:41.880 --> 43:43.291
but I can't remember.

43:45.880 --> 43:47.041
Who?

43:47.760 --> 43:49.330
You're too old for this

43:50.680 --> 43:52.284
and too much of a gentleman.

44:26.280 --> 44:27.280
Yes?

44:29.240 --> 44:31.049
Mr Marchal, Sire.

44:37.160 --> 44:38.685
Good evening, Sire.

44:45.360 --> 44:49.729
In case you hadn't noticed,
I'm the King of France.

44:51.440 --> 44:54.444
We've recently
uncovered a plot here in my home

44:54.600 --> 44:57.683
to destroy me and everything I've built.

44:59.040 --> 45:02.761
My brother's wife
was almost killed by one of your police.

45:02.920 --> 45:05.287
As we speak, William of Orange

45:05.440 --> 45:07.920
is seeking ways to destroy me.

45:08.080 --> 45:11.163
And you, my head of security,

45:11.320 --> 45:14.642
whom I pay to keep me alive,
were in Paris.

45:16.240 --> 45:18.049
I hope you had a pleasant time.

45:20.840 --> 45:23.161
I wasn't in Paris, Sire.

45:24.320 --> 45:25.765
That's what I was told.

45:26.400 --> 45:28.528
The fault is mine, Sire.

45:29.680 --> 45:31.887
There was an attempt on my life, so

45:32.040 --> 45:33.963
I concealed my whereabouts and

45:34.120 --> 45:36.282
condition from the person who did it.

45:36.440 --> 45:39.569
- An attempt by whom?
- I don't have proof, Sire,

45:40.160 --> 45:42.083
so I beg your indulgence

45:42.240 --> 45:44.811
until I complete my investigation.

46:12.440 --> 46:14.169
She may not come back.

46:15.840 --> 46:17.251
Of course she will.

46:18.240 --> 46:22.404
Saying anything else
would be an admission of your failure.

46:23.240 --> 46:26.005
She'll return. I know it.

46:30.920 --> 46:34.481
Have you any idea
what sort of place you're creating?

46:34.920 --> 46:36.604
I know you'll tell me.

46:37.720 --> 46:40.451
Your dream palace
is becoming a haven of

46:40.920 --> 46:45.721
plotting, treachery, depravity,
infidelity and immorality.

46:47.800 --> 46:49.086
Did I miss anything?

46:49.600 --> 46:51.648
That's exactly why I'm here.

46:52.320 --> 46:54.527
You're angry I sent her to England.

46:55.640 --> 46:58.246
She has a purpose in life. You don't.

46:59.040 --> 47:00.405
I'm giving you one.

47:02.880 --> 47:04.041
A job?

47:05.160 --> 47:06.241
Yes.

47:06.960 --> 47:09.884
Not going round
with you saying yes all the time?

47:11.920 --> 47:14.924
Sorry, that was infantile of me.

47:18.680 --> 47:21.763
- What do you have in mind?
- Etiquette.

47:24.200 --> 47:25.440
Etiquette.

47:30.040 --> 47:32.327
I want the nobles brought to heel.

47:33.120 --> 47:36.920
They plot against me,
and treat this as their home.

47:38.920 --> 47:42.481
They don't know how to
address the royal family or each other,

47:42.840 --> 47:46.367
how to eat at dinner,
how to be at Versailles.

47:46.520 --> 47:49.444
I want them
to know their place and status,

47:49.800 --> 47:51.962
every minute of the day structured.

47:52.120 --> 47:55.886
From now on,
everyone abides by the same rules.

47:57.840 --> 48:00.730
- Including the King?
- Especially the King.

48:02.040 --> 48:05.726
And who better to control the King
than his brother?

48:21.360 --> 48:22.885
Yes?

48:23.040 --> 48:25.088
Oh! Mr Marchal!

48:26.280 --> 48:27.964
I was worried about you.

48:29.080 --> 48:30.366
So was I.

48:30.520 --> 48:33.763
I went to fetch water,
I returned and you were gone.

48:34.160 --> 48:36.606
For 2 days I looked everywhere for you.

48:36.760 --> 48:38.649
I was delirious,

48:38.800 --> 48:41.963
I didn't know where I was
or what I was doing.

48:42.120 --> 48:45.806
Luckily I was found
and taken to a doctor.

48:46.120 --> 48:47.451
Oh, good.

48:48.320 --> 48:51.244
- Yes, I thought I'd been poisoned.
- Gosh!

48:51.720 --> 48:55.122
But you were right. it was the pheasant.

48:55.560 --> 48:58.450
I had some too,
and I didn't feel too good.

48:59.440 --> 49:03.331
Then I had to go to Paris
on behalf of His Majesty,

49:03.920 --> 49:05.251
and now I'm back.

49:08.880 --> 49:10.086
Something to say?

49:10.960 --> 49:14.567
Well, as a matter of fact, yes. I...

49:15.160 --> 49:16.366
Feel free to speak.

49:16.520 --> 49:18.841
It's nothing. I'll tell you later.

49:21.360 --> 49:22.930
You will stay, won't you?

49:24.680 --> 49:28.241
No thank you.
I just came to get my breeches.

49:30.440 --> 49:31.680
Of course.

50:02.920 --> 50:06.811
- I had them cleaned.
- Most considerate of you.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.844
I'm very pleased you're recovered.

50:13.400 --> 50:14.925
I bid you goodnight.

50:18.880 --> 50:20.086
Goodnight.

50:50.320 --> 50:53.449
Once it was
so free of fog and thicket, wasn't it?

50:54.520 --> 50:55.726
It was.

50:57.920 --> 50:59.684
We knew who we were,

50:59.840 --> 51:02.650
what we wanted, where we were going,

51:04.040 --> 51:06.088
who were enemies and friends,

51:07.720 --> 51:10.246
- but now...
- Is there no turning back?

51:11.120 --> 51:12.120
No.

51:12.840 --> 51:14.808
The path's too narrow to turn.

51:15.800 --> 51:19.009
Each decision's a stride forward,
it cannot be revoked.

51:20.920 --> 51:22.763
What's your greatest fear?

51:25.440 --> 51:26.440
To be alone.

51:26.600 --> 51:29.046
You'll never be alone.

51:30.040 --> 51:33.283
- Spoken by a true friend.
- Well, I do my best.

51:36.680 --> 51:39.206
To things and people we left behind.

51:39.600 --> 51:41.523
And to a brighter future.
