00:03.742 --> 00:08.095
Mom, I notice lately you're
putting tilapia in every dish.

00:08.138 --> 00:10.053
Even the ice cream
has fish bones in it.

00:10.097 --> 00:11.533
I 'unno. I dig it.

00:13.056 --> 00:16.059
Welp, gotta go.
Got a date with the library.

00:16.103 --> 00:19.019
Gotta get my read on!

00:19.062 --> 00:20.672
We believe you, honey.

00:20.716 --> 00:22.544
Peace!

00:23.806 --> 00:26.852
There's no wayyyy Mom's reading
at the library every night.

00:26.896 --> 00:28.376
She won't even go
to a restaurant

00:28.419 --> 00:30.117
if it doesn't have
a picture menu.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.815
Of <i>course</i> she's not
actually at the library!

00:32.858 --> 00:34.686
She knows I could
never smooch a bookworm,

00:34.730 --> 00:36.340
let alone do it with one.

00:36.384 --> 00:38.908
I got twenty says Mom's
actually been sneaking

00:38.951 --> 00:42.085
her pet orangutan into the zoo
after hours so it can get laid.

00:42.129 --> 00:44.324
Well, this, of course, hinges
on my <i>other</i> long-standing theory

00:44.348 --> 00:46.655
that Mom has
a secret pet orangutan.

00:46.698 --> 00:50.093
Ben Frank says she's sneakin'
off to be a Patch Adams.

00:50.137 --> 00:53.488
Going to hospitals and goofing
off to get those uptight doctors

00:53.531 --> 00:55.446
to stop taking themselves
so seriously.

00:55.490 --> 00:59.102
Guys, I need to get
something off my chest.

00:59.146 --> 01:03.193
I'm... struggling
with depression.

01:03.237 --> 01:05.021
I'm in the darkest place
I've ever been...

01:05.065 --> 01:08.546
Ooh, ooh! I have a fiver says
Francine is carrying buckets.

01:08.590 --> 01:10.374
Maybe down a road...

01:10.418 --> 01:13.943
or at a...
bucket... factory.

01:13.986 --> 01:15.771
Super interesting.

01:15.814 --> 01:17.425
But didn't you have the CIA

01:17.468 --> 01:19.601
put a tracking device
on Mom's car?

01:19.644 --> 01:21.013
That's so I can know where
your mom is at all times

01:21.037 --> 01:22.821
so I can control her.

01:22.865 --> 01:25.389
But I don't want to use it
for other, <i>twisted</i> reasons.

01:25.433 --> 01:27.609
But isn't <i>this wanting to know</i>

01:27.652 --> 01:29.480
where she is
so you can control her?

01:29.524 --> 01:32.135
No, no, it's not.
Oh, wait! Yeah, it is!

01:34.746 --> 01:38.533
The tracker confirms
Francine's at the... library!

01:45.670 --> 01:47.585
- Hi, Jolene.
- Hey, Francine!

01:47.629 --> 01:49.848
Oh, I put some new
reading materials

01:49.892 --> 01:51.241
in the restroom for you.

01:53.896 --> 01:55.985
- Did you say something?
- I said...

01:56.028 --> 01:57.465

We're not a family of nerds!
We're a family of jocks!

02:39.071 --> 02:41.509
Except for... Steve.

02:41.552 --> 02:42.771
You did this!

02:42.814 --> 02:44.294
Look!
He's got glasses, Stan!

02:44.338 --> 02:45.991
Knock 'em off!
Knock 'em off!

02:46.035 --> 02:49.386
Mom's the one at the library!
I like TV!

02:49.430 --> 02:51.214
T-That's what
the glasses are for!

02:51.258 --> 02:53.999
Oh, Francine! This isn't
how it's supposed to be!

02:54.043 --> 02:55.827
We were going to
grow old together!

02:55.871 --> 02:57.655
And then I would be
the first to die,

02:57.699 --> 03:01.311
she would mourn me for 17 months
and start dating Jackson.

03:01.355 --> 03:03.792
That was the plan!
Did she forget the plan?!

03:03.835 --> 03:06.447
We can't do the plan
if she's a bookworm!

03:06.490 --> 03:09.624
I gotta go down to that library!

03:09.667 --> 03:11.843
Goodbye, cruel world.

03:14.150 --> 03:16.326
I just tried to drown myself.

03:20.112 --> 03:23.725
Smell like Totino pizza roll.

03:23.768 --> 03:25.509
This Steve turd.

03:29.296 --> 03:31.298
Rogu, we have a pool.

03:31.341 --> 03:35.171
Rogu collect doo-doo data.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.608
As a parent, I'm mad,
but as a scientist,

03:37.652 --> 03:39.610
my instinct
is to encourage this.

03:39.654 --> 03:43.005
Rogu missing one doody, though.

03:43.048 --> 03:45.529
Francine.

03:45.573 --> 03:47.705
Really?
Francine's super regular.

03:47.749 --> 03:50.882
She always used to poop
right after dinner.

03:50.926 --> 03:53.885
Francine's not going to
the library to read words!

03:53.929 --> 03:55.670
She's going there
to leave turds!

03:55.713 --> 03:57.062
But why?

03:57.106 --> 03:58.673
Who cares?

03:58.716 --> 04:02.242
I know someone who would care
quite a bit.

04:03.895 --> 04:06.550
Sherlock Groans, poop detective!

04:06.594 --> 04:08.073
I gotta get to the library

04:08.117 --> 04:10.989
to solve the case
of the displaced doo-doo.

04:11.033 --> 04:13.949
Otherwise my nemesis Nancy Poo
might beat me to it

04:13.992 --> 04:16.081
or, worse, the Farty Boys.

04:16.125 --> 04:18.127
So you can see
how serious this is, Rogu.

04:18.170 --> 04:19.476
Yes.

04:19.520 --> 04:22.827
Time is of the ass-scents.

04:22.871 --> 04:25.830
Ah. Good one!
Daddy's proud.

04:25.874 --> 04:28.268
But not too much.
I'm kind of the star here.

04:31.575 --> 04:33.229
- Ah-ha!
- Aah!

04:34.274 --> 04:35.536
What are you doing?!

04:35.579 --> 04:37.059
What are <i>you</i> doing?

04:37.102 --> 04:38.626
Sorry. I-I-I know
what you're doing.

04:38.669 --> 04:41.716
But... But why?
But also, hi!

04:41.759 --> 04:44.632
Please tell me my wife
isn't really here!

04:44.675 --> 04:45.981
Hm, what does she look like?

04:46.024 --> 04:47.330
She's got the hair.

04:47.374 --> 04:49.637
Uh, couple little feet.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.465
- Does she have the boobs?
- Yes!

04:51.508 --> 04:53.249
Ohh! Francine!

04:53.293 --> 04:54.772
She's in the bathroom.

04:54.816 --> 04:58.689
Thank God! Maybe I can
stop her before she reads.

04:58.733 --> 05:01.518
Mystery fans everywhere
need to know.

05:01.562 --> 05:04.739
Why are you coming to
the library to do your business?

05:04.782 --> 05:07.132
- I don't want to talk about it!
- Come on!

05:07.176 --> 05:10.310
I got dressed up in my Sherlock
Groans outfit and everything!

05:10.353 --> 05:11.659
It's embarrassing.

05:11.702 --> 05:13.138
Uh, which part? The hat?

05:13.182 --> 05:15.227
Or, like, this little cape
on my shoulders?

05:15.271 --> 05:16.794
Francine!

05:16.838 --> 05:19.144
- Are you in there?
- Is that Stan?

05:19.188 --> 05:22.365
Yeah, he's on some jock mission
to not let you read like a nerd.

05:22.409 --> 05:27.152
Francine, we need to talk
about how you're... a reader.

05:27.196 --> 05:29.720
- Told ya.
- Stan can't know
I come here to poop!

05:29.764 --> 05:32.201
Maybe...
hide me in the toilet?

05:32.244 --> 05:34.508
Are you kidding? That's
the <i>first</i> place he'll look!

05:34.551 --> 05:36.553
Remember? That's
the first place <i>I</i> looked.

05:36.597 --> 05:38.555
Damn it, Francine!
I'm slowly building up

05:38.599 --> 05:40.165
the courage to enter
the women's room!

05:40.209 --> 05:41.906
You gotta hide me!

05:41.950 --> 05:44.169
I <i>could</i> use my alien powers

05:44.213 --> 05:45.910
to place us in one
of these stories.

05:45.954 --> 05:48.217
- You can do that?!
- You know it!

05:48.260 --> 05:50.132
But I've never done it before,

05:50.175 --> 05:51.873
so it could be highly risky.

05:51.916 --> 05:54.658
It could also be smooth sailing.
Lots of variables here.

05:54.702 --> 05:56.530
I'm a poop detective,
not a book scientist.

05:56.573 --> 05:58.183
Roger, put me in the damn book!

05:58.227 --> 06:00.185
How 'bout we take a trip
to the ballroom?

06:00.229 --> 06:02.449
That sounds fun.

06:02.492 --> 06:04.102
Francine?

06:05.713 --> 06:09.151
Francine!

06:09.194 --> 06:11.196
Did I say that out loud?

06:12.546 --> 06:13.895
Where the hell did she go?

06:21.859 --> 06:26.168
Oh, my God! It worked!
We escaped!

06:26.211 --> 06:28.910
Oh, <i>this</i> kind of ballroom.

06:28.953 --> 06:32.217
Someone stole this
poor woman's clothes!

06:32.261 --> 06:34.350
I can see her ankles!

06:34.394 --> 06:35.743
Perhaps she's a prostitute.

06:35.786 --> 06:37.788
I'm not a prostitute!

06:37.832 --> 06:40.443
For the right amount of money, <i>
anyone's</i> a prostitute.

06:40.487 --> 06:42.706
That's, like, Being Alive 101.

06:42.750 --> 06:47.102
She's so exotic!
She <i>must</i> be Italian!

06:47.145 --> 06:49.539
That's correctamundo.

06:49.583 --> 06:51.454
A-Lisa Lampanelli.

06:51.498 --> 06:53.935
Ooh! Please!
Sing us a song!

06:53.978 --> 06:56.459
Italy has the most
wonderful music.

06:56.503 --> 06:58.156
Follow my lead.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.985

07:01.029 --> 07:03.248

07:16.261 --> 07:19.656
So... I guess we just hang out
in <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>

07:19.700 --> 07:22.790
until Stan gives up and stops
searching the library for me?

07:22.833 --> 07:24.922
Yeah, about that...
Since I helped you escape,

07:24.966 --> 07:27.359
you gotta tell me
why you poop at the library.

07:28.796 --> 07:30.537
It's because of what happened

07:30.580 --> 07:33.496
two years ago
on our flight to Maui.

07:33.540 --> 07:37.152
I had the barbacoa tacos
from Taco King before takeoff,

07:37.195 --> 07:40.155
and it ripped through me
at 10,000 feet.

07:40.198 --> 07:43.941
I was locked in the lavatory
for a solid hour.

07:43.985 --> 07:46.596
Fortunately, Stan was watching <i>
Son of the Mask,</i>

07:46.640 --> 07:48.337
so he didn't notice I was gone.

07:48.380 --> 07:50.252
Okay, so you had diarrhea
on a plane.

07:50.295 --> 07:52.167
I don't understand
the embarrassment.

07:52.210 --> 07:54.212
My mom always told me

07:54.256 --> 07:56.824
to preserve some mystery
in marriage.

07:56.867 --> 07:59.740
Your mom who shaves her
bikini line at the hotel pool?

07:59.783 --> 08:01.524
Just let me say...

08:01.568 --> 08:05.833
not all plane accidents
involve a crash.

08:05.876 --> 08:10.054
After I dropped that stink bomb,
it was <i>bad.</i>

08:10.098 --> 08:13.057
It was "emergency land the plane

08:13.101 --> 08:15.843
because it stinks so bad" bad.

08:15.886 --> 08:17.845
- No!
- In Omaha.

08:17.888 --> 08:19.542
No!

08:19.586 --> 08:22.327
I've never seen Stan so upset.

08:22.371 --> 08:24.155
He swore he wouldn't rest

08:24.199 --> 08:26.723
until he found out
who was responsible.

08:26.767 --> 08:29.378
I've been so afraid
that he'd find out it was me,

08:29.421 --> 08:32.163
I've just been avoiding
our bathroom altogether.

08:32.207 --> 08:34.035
I smashed my champagne flute
for drama,

08:34.078 --> 08:35.732
but I'm having regrets.

08:35.776 --> 08:37.081
Are you listening to me?

08:37.125 --> 08:38.996
I can listen and miss
my champagne

08:39.040 --> 08:40.737
at the same time, Francine.

08:40.781 --> 08:44.175
Ahem! I'm not sure how people
do things in Italy,

08:44.219 --> 08:48.092
but here in England,
we don't discuss diarrhea.

08:48.136 --> 08:50.181
Don't say that word!

08:50.225 --> 08:52.575
<i>They</i> said it!
I was just repeating it!

08:52.619 --> 08:54.316
This is an outrage!

08:54.359 --> 08:56.318
I was falling in love
with Miss Bennett!

08:56.361 --> 08:59.669
Oh, Darcy!
My heart overflows!

08:59.713 --> 09:01.584
But now that
I've heard discussions,

09:01.628 --> 09:05.196
here in England,
of Italian diarrhea,

09:05.240 --> 09:09.026
I've been tempted by the lures
of obscene foreign delights.

09:09.070 --> 09:10.811
Off to Italy!

09:10.854 --> 09:13.988
Wow. First, he thinks
I don't have enough money.

09:14.031 --> 09:16.468
And now I don't have
enough diarrhea?

09:16.512 --> 09:18.862
What do men even want?

09:18.906 --> 09:21.822
These two ruined everything!

09:21.865 --> 09:23.998
Kill the Italians!

09:28.045 --> 09:30.787
Where'd they go?
Why aren't they following us?

09:30.831 --> 09:32.354
I took us into a new book,

09:32.397 --> 09:34.530
whatever was under <i>
Pride and Prejudice.</i>

09:34.574 --> 09:37.620
The books have to be touching
for me to take us into them.

09:37.664 --> 09:40.623
Looks like
we're in a <i>Dr. Seuss.</i>

09:40.667 --> 09:42.277
Is that a Lorax?

09:42.320 --> 09:44.018
I do beg your pardon,

09:44.061 --> 09:46.847
but you appear to be
trespassing in my study.

09:46.890 --> 09:50.285
Ohh! Sherlock Holmes! Roger,
that's, like, <i>your</i> thing.

09:50.328 --> 09:52.809
Sherlock Groans,
at your service.

09:52.853 --> 09:55.899
Sherlock <i>Holmes, at yourservice.</i>

09:55.943 --> 09:57.118
And me?

09:57.161 --> 09:59.642
Still good ol' Francine!

10:03.690 --> 10:06.388
Damn it!
Francine's not a nerd.

10:06.431 --> 10:09.043
How could she like...
Jane Austen?

10:09.086 --> 10:12.655
Maybe if it was
Jane Austen Powers, bay-bee,

10:12.699 --> 10:14.526
then I'd get the appeal.

10:14.570 --> 10:16.528
I wish I could get rid
of all these dumb things.

10:16.572 --> 10:18.661
I think I can help you.

10:18.705 --> 10:20.184
But you're a librarian.

10:20.228 --> 10:21.795
Aren't books, like, your thing?

10:21.838 --> 10:23.579
Oh, I like books.

10:25.233 --> 10:28.323
But I'm married to the flame.

10:30.978 --> 10:33.676
So, you've gotta tell me...
what's with the little cape?

10:33.720 --> 10:35.112
You're not a superhero.

10:35.156 --> 10:37.288
You're right!
It's ridiculous!

10:37.332 --> 10:41.336
<i>Why</i> I wear it is the only
mystery I could never solve.

10:41.379 --> 10:43.947
Would you two shut up?!
Roger, take us home!

10:43.991 --> 10:45.185
That'd be great,
wouldn't it, Francine?

10:45.209 --> 10:46.689
If we could just go back?

10:46.733 --> 10:48.386
Are you saying
we can't go back?!

10:48.430 --> 10:50.388
Maybe.
I just don't know how.

10:50.432 --> 10:52.608
I told you.
This is my first time.

10:52.652 --> 10:55.306
Holmes! Holmes!
The library's on fire!

10:55.350 --> 10:57.787
Check it out.
It's Dr. Watson.

10:57.831 --> 10:59.789
<i>Two</i> Sherlocks?

10:59.833 --> 11:02.400
How do I know
which one to shoot?

11:02.444 --> 11:03.769
Why do you need
to shoot either of us?

11:03.793 --> 11:04.838
Him! Him!

11:06.753 --> 11:09.016
Hey! <i>
I'm</i> Sherlock Groans.

11:11.192 --> 11:14.499
<i>A Diarrhea Adventure?</i>

11:14.543 --> 11:17.546
Roger! I think
we changed the book!

11:17.589 --> 11:20.723
It sounds like we made it
absolutely hilarious, frankly.

11:20.767 --> 11:23.552
But stop wasting time!
There's a fire!

11:23.595 --> 11:26.337
Is this <i>Alice in Wonderland?</i>

11:26.381 --> 11:29.166
Ooh! I've always wondered
what he's smoking.

11:32.909 --> 11:34.824
It's actually pretty weak shit.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.790
Whoa! Maybe this is stronger
than I thought.

11:43.833 --> 11:45.052
No, that really happened.

11:45.095 --> 11:46.793
Come on!

11:49.665 --> 11:52.102
The Yellow Brick Road?

11:52.146 --> 11:53.495
We must be in <i>The Wizard of Oz.</i>

11:55.366 --> 11:56.759
Oh, no!
Oh, no, oh, no!

12:00.937 --> 12:03.766
Weird. There's a fire
in all these books.

12:03.810 --> 12:06.421
Oh, no.
I know what's happening.

12:06.464 --> 12:09.598
The librarian is
a recovering pyromaniac!

12:09.641 --> 12:13.645
She <i>just</i> got her 20-year chip
and congratulatory lighter!

12:13.689 --> 12:15.560
And now she's gonna
burn us to death!

12:15.604 --> 12:17.258
Roger, let's go!

12:17.301 --> 12:19.216
Of course, in the book,
the magic slippers

12:19.260 --> 12:21.610
are silver, not ruby.
That was just in the movie.

12:21.653 --> 12:24.831
In fact, Judy Garland has said
it was the ruby slippers alone

12:24.874 --> 12:27.007
that launched her career
as Judge Judy!

12:27.050 --> 12:30.619
We don't have time for...
Ooh! Those look good on you!

12:30.662 --> 12:31.794
Work it, girl!

12:31.838 --> 12:34.884
Oh, yeah!
Now run, girl!

12:39.280 --> 12:42.413
Stan Smith!
I knew I recognized you.

12:42.457 --> 12:44.981
You had that book signing here
a couple months ago.

12:46.635 --> 12:51.248
Book signings happen
at book stores. Dumbass.

12:51.292 --> 12:54.077
Hmm.
Was my failure as an author

12:54.121 --> 12:56.036
why I turned against reading?

12:56.079 --> 12:57.689
Guess I'll never know.

12:57.733 --> 12:59.779
Because I'm destroying
all the evidence!

13:07.308 --> 13:09.527
Oh, thank God!
We're home!

13:09.571 --> 13:11.747
It must be because
of the magic slippers!

13:15.751 --> 13:18.493
Why does Stan look like
a tall, skinny baby?

13:18.536 --> 13:22.062
Uh-oh. That's how he describes
himself in his memoir.

13:22.105 --> 13:25.065
His memoir?
What do you mean, his "memoir"?

13:25.108 --> 13:26.675
I mean, we're still in a book!

13:26.718 --> 13:28.677
You didn't read
your husband's book?

13:28.720 --> 13:31.419
It was self-published.
Yuck.

13:31.462 --> 13:34.814
I trust the coastal elites
to tell <i>me</i> what to read.

13:34.857 --> 13:36.076
Hey, look! It's you!

13:48.828 --> 13:50.873
And Stan gave you
itty bitty apple fritties.

13:50.917 --> 13:53.745
Does he think
I have small boobs?

13:53.789 --> 13:55.704
Or does he <i>want</i> me
to have small boobs?

13:55.747 --> 13:57.706
See, those are
the kinds of questions

13:57.749 --> 14:00.404
great literature provokes.
Now run!

14:03.930 --> 14:05.627
We're trapped!

14:05.670 --> 14:09.022
If we die in Stan's memoir,
do we die in real life?!

14:09.065 --> 14:11.372
Well, I think <i>I'll</i> be fine.
I don't know about you.

14:11.415 --> 14:13.591
- What do you mean?!
- Because of this!

14:13.635 --> 14:15.855
I don't burn!

14:15.898 --> 14:17.769
Being an alien's a hoot!

14:17.813 --> 14:20.250
Why have you been running
from the fire this whole time

14:20.294 --> 14:21.904
if you're gonna survive?!

14:21.948 --> 14:23.993
I was trying to get
my 10,000 steps in.

14:24.037 --> 14:25.952
Plus, if my heart rate
gets over 90,

14:25.995 --> 14:27.344
I get an extra dessert.

14:27.388 --> 14:29.433
I'm thinking...
bananas Foster?

14:33.916 --> 14:36.571
These are <i>good.
I see why people like these.</i>

14:37.920 --> 14:39.835
And there's no cleanup!

14:39.879 --> 14:42.055
Seriously?
Nothing, Francine?

14:42.098 --> 14:44.231
I'm working my ass off here
so you can meet the devil

14:44.274 --> 14:45.623
with a smile on your face.

14:48.757 --> 14:50.628
How the hell did <i>that</i> happen?

14:50.672 --> 14:53.675
I can't destroy my own work!

14:53.718 --> 14:56.983
I put four hours of my life
into writing it.

14:57.026 --> 14:59.289
We gotta figure out how
to get out of these books!

14:59.333 --> 15:02.292
Yes! So I can find out
why Stan gave me

15:02.336 --> 15:04.642
those eensy weensy baby boobies!

15:08.081 --> 15:10.561
Jesus!
What is that smell?!

15:12.172 --> 15:13.956
Oh, no! Nooo!

15:14.000 --> 15:16.306
This is the flight when
I took that poisonous dump!

15:16.350 --> 15:18.482
Uch!

15:18.526 --> 15:21.137
Did someone burn the hair
off a dead squirrel?!

15:21.181 --> 15:24.314
I don't smell anything.

15:24.358 --> 15:27.622
Hey! This awful smell
is ruining the Kind bar

15:27.665 --> 15:30.190
I bought at the airport for $17!

15:30.233 --> 15:33.845
Ugh! The stench is drifting
into first class!

15:33.889 --> 15:35.804
Over my dead body!

15:35.847 --> 15:39.155
All coach passengers,
link arms to protect the rich!

15:42.245 --> 15:44.117
<i>On behalf of
the flight crew, I apologize</i>

15:44.160 --> 15:46.249
<i>for the smell
coming from our lavatory.</i>

15:46.293 --> 15:49.209
<i>We're gonna have to make
an emergency landing in Omaha.</i>

15:49.252 --> 15:51.776
<i>I know it smells only
slightly better in Omaha,</i>

15:51.820 --> 15:54.083
<i>but they're the only airport
who will accept us.</i>

15:54.127 --> 15:55.780
Omaha!

15:58.044 --> 15:59.480
This is unbelievable!

15:59.523 --> 16:01.612
I'm not going to rest
until I find out

16:01.656 --> 16:04.485
whose dump destroyed
this plane's bathroom!

16:04.528 --> 16:07.705
And if I do somehow rest,
it will be the fitful sleep

16:07.749 --> 16:10.186
of a man who doesn't know
who took said dump.

16:12.014 --> 16:15.975
This is so embarrassing!
How could Stan publish this?!

16:16.018 --> 16:18.281
I wanna go back
to the <i>real</i> world!

16:18.325 --> 16:21.806
Maybe we <i>would</i> go back
if Stan <i>couldn't</i> publish this.

16:21.850 --> 16:23.765
What do you mean?

16:23.808 --> 16:26.463
I mean, if his memoir didn't
exist, we couldn't be in it.

16:26.507 --> 16:29.162
Right. What keeps a book
from getting published?

16:29.205 --> 16:30.946
Well, they wouldn't
publish <i>my</i> book

16:30.990 --> 16:33.340
because it had an unacceptable
amount of bestiality.

16:33.383 --> 16:35.385
Only 14 scenes!

16:35.429 --> 16:39.128
Great! Let's throw a little
bestiality up in this memoir!

16:39.172 --> 16:42.044
That blind guy's German Shepherd
is probably DTF,

16:42.088 --> 16:43.828
so get to it!

16:45.961 --> 16:47.484
The dog turned me down.

16:47.528 --> 16:49.791
Because it thinks
it's better than me!

16:49.834 --> 16:53.012
Okay. What <i>else</i> could keep this
memoir from being published?

16:53.055 --> 16:56.580
Well, you can't self-publish
on Amazon if it has bestiality,

16:56.624 --> 16:58.278
pedophilia, bomb making...

16:58.321 --> 17:00.410
Bomb making?!
Let's do that one!

17:00.454 --> 17:02.891
One hitch... I don't know
how to make a bomb.

17:02.934 --> 17:05.676
I know it's kind of bougie,
but I always buy them pre-made.

17:05.720 --> 17:08.244
Girl, I could make
a pipe bomb in my sleep.

17:08.288 --> 17:09.874
But you don't have
any of the ingredients.

17:09.898 --> 17:12.422
Yeah, but we can
rewrite this memoir

17:12.466 --> 17:14.033
like we did <i>Pride and Prejudice.</i>

17:17.645 --> 17:21.214
A gallon of rubber cement,
a half cup of salt,

17:21.257 --> 17:24.391
10 pounds of manure,
a steel pipe,

17:24.434 --> 17:26.871
and a Barbie leg for a fuse.

17:26.915 --> 17:29.787
- Voilà! Pipe bomb.
- You did it!

17:29.831 --> 17:30.875
Aaaaahhhh!

17:31.920 --> 17:33.835
Hey! <i>
There's</i> my rake!

17:33.878 --> 17:35.793
It's actually not.
I-I brought this from home.

17:35.837 --> 17:37.143
What a weird lie.

17:37.186 --> 17:38.579
I'm a weird guy.

17:38.622 --> 17:40.450
Aaaah!

17:40.494 --> 17:42.670
Aw, come on!
I just raked that!

17:42.713 --> 17:44.802
Did I actually make it back?

17:44.846 --> 17:47.066
Just in time to ruin my pile.

17:47.109 --> 17:48.850
My precious pile.

17:48.893 --> 17:51.635
Stan.
I-I have to be honest.

17:51.679 --> 17:55.117
I don't come
to the library to read.

17:55.161 --> 17:56.597
I come here to poop.

17:56.640 --> 18:00.035
In the books? Nice!
So you <i>are</i> a jock!

18:00.079 --> 18:02.472
No, Stan.
In the bathroom.

18:02.516 --> 18:04.126
To hide my <i>real</i> secret.

18:04.170 --> 18:06.346
Aaah!
Sorry I'm late.

18:06.389 --> 18:08.826
I jumped into the book <i>1984
to go back</i>

18:08.870 --> 18:12.047
and get the Daytona Beach
spring break I always wanted.

18:12.091 --> 18:15.703
Suffice it to say,
it was <i>not</i> totally tubular.

18:18.358 --> 18:19.924
I don't get it, Francine.

18:19.968 --> 18:23.014
Your secret is you eat tacos
in the bathroom stall?

18:23.058 --> 18:24.407
That's not so bad.

18:24.451 --> 18:26.453
I once went back to get
the half cup of beer

18:26.496 --> 18:28.063
I left on the toilet
at Shea Stadium.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.065
Although it was
completely untouched

18:30.109 --> 18:32.807
and even more full than before,
it's still a little gross.

18:32.850 --> 18:35.592
I don't <i>always
eat tacos in the bathroom,</i>

18:35.636 --> 18:39.030
but I do always end up
in the bathroom afterwards.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.644
- What?
- Sir, in your story,

18:43.687 --> 18:45.646
I think you were
drinking pee-pee!

18:45.689 --> 18:48.605
No, little girl.
It was just delicious hot beer!

18:48.649 --> 18:51.173
Are you getting
a whiff of anything yet?

18:51.217 --> 18:52.522
Like what?

18:57.875 --> 19:00.095
Oh, God!

19:00.139 --> 19:01.618
Omaha was you!

19:01.662 --> 19:03.881
I know.

19:03.925 --> 19:05.927
How could you hide this from me?

19:05.970 --> 19:07.494
I was raised to think a woman

19:07.537 --> 19:09.887
should keep some mystery
in her marriage.

19:09.931 --> 19:11.672
But I don't want that.

19:11.715 --> 19:13.630
I want to know everything
about you, Francine.

19:13.674 --> 19:16.677
You do?!
Even the gross stuff?

19:16.720 --> 19:18.548
Yes, especially the gross stuff.

19:18.592 --> 19:21.160
But you seemed so upset
on the plane.

19:21.203 --> 19:22.987
Yeah, I was mad I didn't
get to shake hands

19:23.031 --> 19:24.946
with the butt
that made that mess!

19:24.989 --> 19:27.209
It was hilarious! Everyone
on the plane was like...

19:27.253 --> 19:30.081
Ugh-ugh-eghh-egh-egh!

19:30.125 --> 19:34.129
Wow! That is a weight
off my shoulders.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.652
You know what?

19:35.696 --> 19:37.698
I'm gonna poop at home
from now on,

19:37.741 --> 19:40.091
no matter how smelly it is.

19:40.135 --> 19:43.182
I would love nothing more,
Francine.

19:43.225 --> 19:45.545
Although I don't think you can
ever top your airplane poop.

19:45.575 --> 19:47.490
Nothing will <i>ever</i> be funnier
than that.

19:47.534 --> 19:49.884
Is that why you put it
in your memoir?

19:49.927 --> 19:51.364
You read my memoir?

19:51.407 --> 19:54.105
Yeah! It really...
sucked me in.

19:54.149 --> 19:55.933
That's so sweet of you.

19:55.977 --> 19:58.216
Man, that thing was terrible.
No one would even publish it.

19:58.240 --> 20:02.113
Well, those coastal elites are
out of touch with what's good.

20:02.157 --> 20:05.682
But, hey, why'd you write
about me having a flat chest?

20:05.726 --> 20:07.510
What was <i>that</i> all about?

20:07.554 --> 20:09.556
Flat chest?
Oh, that must be a typo.

20:09.599 --> 20:11.384
I meant to write
"fat chest."

20:11.427 --> 20:13.473
I love them fat sacks, baby!

20:13.516 --> 20:15.214
Oh, Stan.

20:15.257 --> 20:17.694
You always know
just what to say.

20:22.003 --> 20:24.397
I was a little surprised
to find a website

20:24.440 --> 20:26.312
that matched depressed singles
with each other.

20:26.355 --> 20:28.575
But look at you!

20:28.618 --> 20:30.794
Score for Klaus!

20:30.838 --> 20:33.841
You didn't say in your e-Sadness
profile that you're a fish.

20:33.884 --> 20:35.973
Oh, I see
the miscommunication here.

20:36.017 --> 20:37.279
I was lying.

20:37.323 --> 20:40.848
Yeah, I don't date liars.

20:40.891 --> 20:44.765
Oh, and, by the way,
I'm <i>super</i> into sex.

20:44.808 --> 20:46.984
Well, you didn't explicitly
say in <i>your</i> profile

20:47.028 --> 20:48.551
that you <i>weren't</i> a fish!

20:48.595 --> 20:50.988
And you don't see me
crying about it!

20:53.426 --> 20:56.820
I miss sex!

20:56.864 --> 20:58.474
Bye-bye! See you soon!
