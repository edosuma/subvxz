00:00.450 --> 00:02.990
Previously onElementary...
I’m Mycroft.

00:03.590 --> 00:05.010
Mycroft Holmes.

00:05.010 --> 00:07.010
I love you, brother.

00:07.010 --> 00:08.680
What’s happened?
Mycroft died.

00:08.680 --> 00:11.760
He’s faked his death before.
I mean, maybe...
No.

00:11.760 --> 00:13.550
Several years ago,
I anticipated

00:13.550 --> 00:16.470
that without Moriarty,
her group would fall apart.

00:16.470 --> 00:17.590
I was mistaken.

00:17.590 --> 00:18.800
Someone else has taken over.

00:18.800 --> 00:21.510
I did it for you,
Sherlock. You and Joan.

00:21.510 --> 00:24.140
It was the only way to guarantee
they’d never harm you.

00:24.140 --> 00:26.140
So your only recourse
was to become head

00:26.140 --> 00:28.590
of an organization
which murders for profit.

00:28.590 --> 00:31.600
How else would I dismantle it?

00:33.430 --> 00:35.590
♪ ♪

00:45.470 --> 00:46.260
This looks wrong.

00:46.260 --> 00:48.470
We should have made a left
at that last junction.

00:48.470 --> 00:50.180
Says the guy who got
us completely lost

00:50.180 --> 00:51.590
the last time
he navigated.

00:51.590 --> 00:53.010
I’m just saying.
Having a penis

00:53.010 --> 00:54.850
doesn’t grant you an
innate sense of direction.

00:54.850 --> 00:59.760
My girl parts say
that we are almost there.

Hey!

What the hell was that?

01:41.010 --> 01:41.930
Should I go after him?

01:41.930 --> 01:44.930
Pretty sure we don’t want
to catch up to him.

01:44.930 --> 01:46.600
Look.

Apologies for the lateness
of the hour.

02:06.090 --> 02:07.970
As I said when you called,

02:07.970 --> 02:12.090
I felt compelled to see
my only remaining son

02:12.090 --> 02:14.220
as soon as possible.

02:15.090 --> 02:17.300
We have much to discuss.

02:17.300 --> 02:21.100
This tortoise appears
to be quite young.

02:21.100 --> 02:24.720
Couldn’t be any more
than, what, four?

02:24.720 --> 02:27.390
He’s seven, the
best we can tell.

02:27.390 --> 02:32.300
Either way, he’ll outlive you
and Joan by several decades.

02:32.300 --> 02:34.510
Have arrangements been made?

02:34.510 --> 02:36.350
Yes, my former
apprentice Kitty

02:36.350 --> 02:38.470
is going to take him
when the time comes.

02:38.470 --> 02:42.220
Her son will inherit him
after that, and so forth.

02:42.220 --> 02:45.470
Well, it’s wise
to prepare for the worst.

02:45.470 --> 02:50.930
Although I’ll allow that some
preparations are unreliable.

02:50.930 --> 02:55.390
My will states that Mycroft
should deliver my eulogy.

02:55.390 --> 02:59.090
Now it seems that he’s been dead
for the better part of a year

02:59.090 --> 03:01.090
and buried in some distant land.

03:01.090 --> 03:04.350
I always thought
he would outlive us both.

03:04.350 --> 03:08.220
The fact he has preceded
both you and I to the grave

03:08.220 --> 03:11.090
despite our more dangerous
paths, uh,

03:11.090 --> 03:14.100
speaks to the inherent injustice
of the universe.

03:14.100 --> 03:16.850
Or its love of irony.

03:16.850 --> 03:21.140
Speaking of danger,
how goes your secret agenda?

03:21.140 --> 03:24.930
Well, for the last two years,
I have made steady progress

03:24.930 --> 03:27.090
in dismantling
Moriarty’s network.

03:27.090 --> 03:30.010
The disappearance
of the solitary cyclist?

03:30.010 --> 03:32.680
The incident
at the priory school?

03:32.680 --> 03:33.970
Among others.

03:33.970 --> 03:36.680
Sadly, I have been unable
to foil

03:36.680 --> 03:39.930
all of the network’s
machinations.

03:39.930 --> 03:43.100
I also had to drain some
of the family finances

03:43.100 --> 03:47.350
to pay dividends to some
of Moriarty’s shareholders

03:47.350 --> 03:51.090
so they won’t think that
their enterprise is unraveling.

03:51.090 --> 03:54.090
There’ll still be
a sizeable sum when I’m done.

03:54.090 --> 03:57.430
Which brings us back
to the matter at hand.

03:57.430 --> 04:00.180
I need to change my will.

04:00.180 --> 04:03.550
Mycroft was the sole heir.

04:04.090 --> 04:06.010
New arrangements
are required.

04:06.010 --> 04:07.640
(cell phone chimes)

04:10.550 --> 04:13.220
Uh, this colleague
of mine-- a...

04:13.220 --> 04:14.970
body’s been found.

04:14.970 --> 04:15.970
Well, I’ll go and...

04:15.970 --> 04:17.180
we’ll have plenty
of time to talk.

04:17.180 --> 04:19.720
I’m going to be in New York
for at least a week.

04:19.720 --> 04:21.890
Well, if you need anything...

04:21.890 --> 04:23.600
I’ll be in touch.

04:23.600 --> 04:25.350
Look, you should know...

04:28.100 --> 04:29.800
I discovered Mycroft was dead

04:29.800 --> 04:32.850
because I was seeking him out
to heal our rift.

04:32.850 --> 04:35.930
Now I won’t have
the chance.

04:35.930 --> 04:36.600
But...

04:36.600 --> 04:40.720
it made me realize
that grudges are pointless

04:40.720 --> 04:47.050
and that people who hold them
are petty and small-minded.

04:48.220 --> 04:51.430
I am neither of those things.

04:54.930 --> 04:57.760
We’ll talk soon...

04:57.760 --> 04:59.600
son.

05:03.680 --> 05:06.760
BELL:
The three hipsters
who found this place

05:06.760 --> 05:09.930
were doing something they
call "urban spelunking."

05:09.930 --> 05:12.680
Otherwise known
as roof-and-tunnel hacking.

05:12.680 --> 05:15.760
The exploration
of man-made structures,

05:15.760 --> 05:17.640
typically abandoned ruins.

05:17.640 --> 05:19.090
They thought
no one had been

05:19.090 --> 05:21.050
in this fallout
shelter for decades.

05:21.050 --> 05:23.100
Instead, they
found all this.

05:23.100 --> 05:25.010
The guy they saw
run out of here

05:25.010 --> 05:26.300
was wearing some
sort of respirator,

05:26.300 --> 05:28.220
so they couldn’t
see his face.

05:28.220 --> 05:30.090
He got away clean.

05:30.090 --> 05:32.260
Victim is a Jane Doe.

05:32.260 --> 05:34.600
No I.D. She’s been
dead a few days.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.600
I’m assuming
the cause of death

05:36.600 --> 05:39.890
was one of these wounds,
but we won’t know for sure

05:39.890 --> 05:41.850
until the M.E. weighs in.

05:41.850 --> 05:43.430
So, the man who
fled was removing

05:43.430 --> 05:46.470
her internal organs through
this cut on her side?

05:46.470 --> 05:48.760
Yeah, intestines, stomach

05:48.760 --> 05:51.140
and liver are in
these clay jars.

05:51.140 --> 05:53.470
Now, when the
spelunkers broke in,

05:53.470 --> 05:56.970
he was in the middle
of pulling out her lungs,

05:56.970 --> 05:59.050
probably to go
in this last jar.

05:59.050 --> 06:02.090
Obviously, the guy’s a sicko.

06:02.090 --> 06:03.760
We’re thinking serial.

06:03.760 --> 06:09.090
Well, that is an understandable,
although mistaken, conclusion.

06:09.090 --> 06:10.300
These mutilations

06:10.300 --> 06:14.090
were not performed to satisfy
some dark impulses.

06:14.090 --> 06:17.050
There is a more cogent scheme
at work.

06:17.050 --> 06:18.140
Note...

06:18.140 --> 06:19.090
this tool.

06:19.090 --> 06:21.470
Now, this is designed
to remove

06:21.470 --> 06:23.010
a cadaver’s brain

06:23.010 --> 06:25.050
through her nose.

06:25.050 --> 06:26.800
Piece by piece.

06:26.800 --> 06:28.090
Then...

06:28.090 --> 06:29.140
there are these items.

06:29.140 --> 06:30.090
There’s honey.

06:30.090 --> 06:32.850
There’s a particularly resinous
Levantine wine.

06:32.850 --> 06:35.090
There is balsam, cedar oil.

06:35.090 --> 06:36.430
These are the ingredients

06:36.430 --> 06:38.600
in a millennia-old recipe

06:38.600 --> 06:40.510
intended to transform
this woman.

06:40.510 --> 06:42.430
Given the level
of craftsmanship,

06:42.430 --> 06:44.390
I’d say our masked man
was looking

06:44.390 --> 06:45.970
to turn her into a copy

06:45.970 --> 06:47.850
of a priceless antiquity.

06:47.850 --> 06:49.180
In other words, a forgery.

06:49.180 --> 06:53.350
What the hell kind of forgery
can you make out of a person?

06:53.350 --> 06:56.100
To the best of my knowledge,
only one.

06:56.100 --> 06:59.090
An Egyptian mummy.

07:05.540 --> 07:07.990
To be honest,
when I first heard your theory,

07:07.990 --> 07:08.990
I was skeptical.

07:08.990 --> 07:11.910
Forging a mummy is ambitious.

07:12.410 --> 07:13.700
And yet it has
been done.

07:13.700 --> 07:15.830
Most recently at a
museum in Pakistan,

07:15.830 --> 07:17.620
where they paid over
$10 million for one

07:17.620 --> 07:19.490
which turned out to
be a modern fake.

07:19.490 --> 07:21.490
The, uh, so-called
Persian Princess.

07:21.490 --> 07:24.000
I said ambitious,
not impossible.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.290
Sorry I’m late.

07:25.290 --> 07:28.160
Traffic was bad,
but I was able to catch up.

07:28.160 --> 07:30.870
Professor Hausmann,
this is Joan Watson.

07:30.870 --> 07:31.660
Pleasure.

07:31.660 --> 07:34.160
The professor is one
of the foremost experts

07:34.160 --> 07:36.290
on Egyptian antiquities
in North America.

07:36.290 --> 07:38.040
He authenticates
artifacts for most

07:38.040 --> 07:40.250
of the major museums
on the East Coast.

07:40.250 --> 07:42.750
Well, it’s nice to meet
another Irregular.

07:42.750 --> 07:43.870
Uh, actually, he’s not

07:43.870 --> 07:46.040
one of my consultants.
He’s, uh, the captain’s.

07:46.040 --> 07:48.950
He helped me out a few times
in the Robbery Squad.

07:48.950 --> 07:50.950
Antiquities theft,
smuggling,

07:50.950 --> 07:51.830
that sort of thing.

07:51.830 --> 07:53.290
Now that I’ve
seen the evidence,

07:53.290 --> 07:54.490
not only do I agree

07:54.490 --> 07:56.540
with your theory,
I think I can tell you

07:56.540 --> 07:59.660
exactly whose mummy
this was supposed to be.

07:59.660 --> 08:02.910
You said your technicians
found this amulet

08:02.910 --> 08:05.490
under the linens
at the crime scene.

08:05.490 --> 08:07.750
Note the cartouche.

08:07.750 --> 08:10.330
This is a proper name.

08:10.330 --> 08:11.540
Sobekneferu.

08:11.540 --> 08:13.750
You read hieroglyphics?

08:13.750 --> 08:15.750
He reads all sorts of things.

08:15.750 --> 08:18.290
So, who’s this Sobekneferu?

08:18.290 --> 08:20.120
HAUSMANN:
A historical rarity.

08:20.120 --> 08:21.700
A female pharaoh.

08:21.700 --> 08:25.490
She died under
mysterious circumstances

08:25.490 --> 08:27.450
when she was in her late 20s.

08:27.450 --> 08:29.040
Over 3,000 years ago.

08:29.040 --> 08:30.580
Her mummy was never found.

08:30.580 --> 08:33.659
It would be worth...
$100 million?

08:33.659 --> 08:35.159
To the right museum

08:35.159 --> 08:37.750
or private collector.
HAUSMANN:
The thing is, you said

08:37.750 --> 08:39.080
this was a homicide
investigation.

08:39.080 --> 08:41.490
I’m not sure that’s right.

08:42.289 --> 08:44.120
We have a dead body.

08:44.120 --> 08:45.490
We have a lot of wounds.

08:45.490 --> 08:47.830
All of which could have been
inflicted postmortem.

08:47.830 --> 08:50.500
The other case you mentioned,
the Persian Princess--

08:50.500 --> 08:53.490
do you recall how the forgers

08:53.490 --> 08:54.490
procured her body?

08:54.490 --> 08:56.540
Stole it from a hospital,
by all accounts.

08:56.540 --> 08:59.410
She likely died
in a traffic accident.

08:59.410 --> 09:00.160
Exactly.

09:00.160 --> 09:04.000
Your forger may have stolen
this corpse as well.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.200
Or bought it

09:05.200 --> 09:07.870
from an unscrupulous
funeral parlor.

09:07.870 --> 09:12.750
In other words, while this may
indeed be a forgery,

09:12.750 --> 09:16.160
it may not be a murder.

09:16.160 --> 09:18.040
It most assuredly
was a bloody murder.

09:18.040 --> 09:20.370
The M.E. doesn’t even
have a report yet.

09:20.370 --> 09:21.870
Don’t need one.

09:21.870 --> 09:25.250
In order to duplicate
Sobekneferu,

09:25.250 --> 09:27.700
the forger would
need a fresh kill,

09:27.700 --> 09:31.490
slain in a historically
accurate way.

09:32.490 --> 09:36.910
I submit the Jane Doe
was killed with one of these.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.040
That’s a khopesh.

09:38.040 --> 09:41.040
It’s the preferred weapon
of the ancient Egyptians.

09:41.040 --> 09:43.000
So, if I manage to adopt a baby,

09:43.000 --> 09:46.490
you know the box of swords
has to go, right?

09:47.160 --> 09:49.490
Note the shape of the blade.

09:49.490 --> 09:51.700
Looks consistent with the wound
on the victim’s leg.

09:51.700 --> 09:54.870
Mm. She was killed
by her nephew, by the way.

09:54.870 --> 09:57.450
Police haven’t even
identified her yet.

09:57.450 --> 09:58.870
Not Jane Doe.
Sobekneferu.

09:58.870 --> 10:01.490
She was almost certainly done in
by her brother’s son,

10:01.490 --> 10:04.290
Sobekhotep, and/or his allies.

10:04.290 --> 10:05.490
He succeeded her to the throne,

10:05.490 --> 10:07.160
and records written
during his dynasty

10:07.160 --> 10:08.910
studiously avoid any mention
of how she died.

10:08.910 --> 10:12.080
That’s a sure sign
that his regime was involved.

10:12.080 --> 10:13.330
Only fair, I suppose,

10:13.330 --> 10:14.540
since she likely murdered
his father

10:14.540 --> 10:17.540
to seize power
in the first place. Anyway...

10:17.540 --> 10:19.580
(Holmes clears throat)

10:23.830 --> 10:26.790
Speaking of fathers,
how’s yours?

10:26.790 --> 10:27.830
Good.

10:27.830 --> 10:29.490
That’s it? Just good?

10:29.490 --> 10:33.160
Mycroft’s death has changed
things for the both of us.

10:33.160 --> 10:37.490
While our, uh, hatchets
have not yet been buried,

10:37.490 --> 10:39.120
the holes are being dug.

10:39.120 --> 10:43.040
Hmm, that’s great.
I’m happy for you.

10:43.040 --> 10:44.910
How are you holding up?

10:44.910 --> 10:46.490
Me?

10:46.490 --> 10:51.080
Well, you and Mycroft
were close for a time.

10:51.620 --> 10:53.490
Well, I’m definitely
grieving.

10:53.490 --> 10:54.830
But when Mycroft
went into hiding,

10:54.830 --> 10:58.830
I knew that he’d never be a
part of my life again, so...

10:58.830 --> 11:01.370
I guess, uh...

11:01.370 --> 11:04.120
I already came to
terms with losing him.

11:04.120 --> 11:06.410
If that makes any sense.

11:06.410 --> 11:08.540
So, where is
Mycroft’s body now?

11:08.540 --> 11:09.580
Was he buried?

11:09.580 --> 11:12.450
Uh, yes, in what, uh...

11:12.450 --> 11:16.620
what turned out to be
his last assumed name,

11:16.620 --> 11:18.490
in a cemetery, uh,

11:18.490 --> 11:20.540
just outside
Christchurch, New Zealand.

11:20.540 --> 11:22.700
Well, have you and your
father talked about

11:22.700 --> 11:24.120
maybe moving him
closer to home?

11:24.120 --> 11:27.290
Despite what the ancient
Egyptians believe,

11:27.290 --> 11:28.490
Mycroft’s body will not provide

11:28.490 --> 11:30.620
a special conduit to him
in the afterlife.

11:30.620 --> 11:33.200
Well, I just thought, if one
of you wanted to visit him

11:33.200 --> 11:34.910
without getting on a plane
for 20 hours...

11:34.910 --> 11:39.040
I’ll mention it to my father.

11:48.080 --> 11:50.450
That’s not bad.

11:51.040 --> 11:52.910
Bit jagged, but...

11:52.910 --> 11:56.500
this particular khopesh hasn’t
been sharpened in some time.

11:56.500 --> 11:58.500
I expect the one
used to kill Jane Doe

11:58.500 --> 12:00.080
was brand-new
and razor sharp.

12:00.080 --> 12:03.120
Wouldn’t he use an antique
for authenticity’s sake?

12:03.120 --> 12:07.540
For authenticity’s sake, yes,
he would use a bronze khopesh,

12:07.540 --> 12:09.950
but bronze becomes
brittle over time,

12:09.950 --> 12:11.040
so a suitably old one

12:11.040 --> 12:13.490
would not be able
to make a cut like this.

12:13.490 --> 12:16.370
I think the forger
and the killer

12:16.370 --> 12:18.040
are two different people.

12:18.040 --> 12:19.490
As I’ve just demonstrated,

12:19.490 --> 12:22.120
making a cut deep enough
to sever the femoral artery

12:22.120 --> 12:24.750
requires skill and strength.

12:24.750 --> 12:27.950
But the postmortem incisions
on the victim

12:27.950 --> 12:28.790
were more tentative.

12:28.790 --> 12:31.450
They were much more sawing
than slicing.

12:31.450 --> 12:32.910
Well, it takes a
strong and steady hand

12:32.910 --> 12:35.490
to make a clean incision
even with a sharp scalpel,

12:35.490 --> 12:37.910
so if the postmortem
cuts were uneven...

12:37.910 --> 12:41.370
We’re looking at the work
of two individuals.

12:41.370 --> 12:44.330
One strong, one less so.

12:44.330 --> 12:45.790
While we might not
as of yet

12:45.790 --> 12:47.120
have a way
to find the forger,

12:47.120 --> 12:51.490
I think we might have a way
to find the swordsman.

12:51.490 --> 12:53.490
MAN:
Riposte.

12:53.490 --> 12:55.330
Parry and riposte.

12:55.330 --> 12:56.080
All right, guys.

12:56.080 --> 12:57.580
BELL:
You and your friends sure seem

12:57.580 --> 13:00.370
to know your way
around ancient weapons.

13:00.370 --> 13:01.490
It’s a hobby.

13:01.490 --> 13:03.410
Reconstructing
old fighting techniques.

13:03.410 --> 13:05.200
I mean, different weapons
lend themselves

13:05.200 --> 13:06.200
to different techniques.

13:06.200 --> 13:09.410
Only way to figure them
out is to use them.

13:09.410 --> 13:11.000
Fight with them.

13:11.450 --> 13:14.490
Last night,
a woman’s body was found.

13:14.490 --> 13:16.450
We haven’t been able
to identify her yet.

13:16.450 --> 13:19.870
But our consultant thinks she
was killed with a reproduction

13:19.870 --> 13:22.700
of a bronze sword
called a khopesh.

13:22.700 --> 13:24.660
The killer seemed to
know what he was doing.

13:24.660 --> 13:27.490
Well, lots of people
play around with this stuff.

13:27.490 --> 13:28.790
I’ve got hundreds of students.

13:28.790 --> 13:31.580
Actually, we don’t think the
person who did it was a student.

13:31.580 --> 13:33.540
A bronze khopesh
is a pretty specialized item.

13:33.540 --> 13:35.950
There’s only a few people
who make them.

13:35.950 --> 13:37.200
So we made some calls.

13:37.200 --> 13:39.290
Turns out a khopesh
was shipped

13:39.290 --> 13:41.040
to this address just last week.

13:41.040 --> 13:42.620
Paid for
on your company account.

13:42.620 --> 13:44.250
I never ordered a khopesh.

13:44.250 --> 13:45.790
I don’t remember seeing
one around the gym.

13:45.790 --> 13:48.910
But to answer the question
I think you’re asking,

13:48.910 --> 13:50.450
I didn’t kill anyone.

13:50.450 --> 13:53.250
Truth is, based on the angle
of the fatal blow,

13:53.250 --> 13:56.040
you’re probably too tall
to be the killer.

13:56.040 --> 13:58.500
Your instructor,
on the other hand...

13:58.500 --> 13:59.870
he’s about
the right height,

13:59.870 --> 14:03.000
and he’s been listening
to every word we’ve said.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.330
Sort of like his life
depended on it.

14:05.330 --> 14:06.750
Don’t!

14:06.750 --> 14:07.950
Whoa, whoa.

14:07.950 --> 14:10.500
Have you seenRaiders of the Lost Ark?

14:10.500 --> 14:13.700
Doesn’t go well
for the guy with the sword.

14:13.700 --> 14:16.080
Trust me.

14:20.490 --> 14:22.490
I want to cut a deal.

14:22.490 --> 14:23.490
That was fast.

14:23.490 --> 14:25.410
That’s how it works, right?

14:25.410 --> 14:26.950
When you kill someone for money?

14:26.950 --> 14:28.490
You roll on whoever hired you,

14:28.490 --> 14:30.490
and the police
take it easy on you.

14:30.490 --> 14:32.540
If you tell us
everything you know,

14:32.540 --> 14:34.580
we’ll definitely
put in a good word

14:34.580 --> 14:36.500
with the district attorney.

14:37.490 --> 14:38.830
Okay, so yeah, I did it.

14:38.830 --> 14:40.700
I killed that girl
with the khopesh.

14:40.700 --> 14:42.290
Just like the others.

14:42.290 --> 14:42.950
Others?

14:42.950 --> 14:46.490
I don’t know the real name
of the guy who hired me.

14:46.490 --> 14:47.540
Just, like, his code name.

14:47.540 --> 14:49.660
But I’ve killed
three different people for him

14:49.660 --> 14:51.490
over the past couple years.

14:51.490 --> 14:54.490
We’re gonna want the names
of the other victims,

14:54.490 --> 14:57.370
not to mention
your friend’s code name.

14:57.370 --> 14:59.000
It’s The Theban.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.370
The Theban?

15:00.370 --> 15:02.200
All I know is he’s
this master forger.

15:02.200 --> 15:04.040
Does all kinds
of historic stuff,

15:04.040 --> 15:06.200
including mummies.
BELL: And you provide

15:06.200 --> 15:08.370
the bodies he uses
to make the mummies?

15:08.370 --> 15:11.490
You should know, I only did it
because I have gambling debts.

15:11.490 --> 15:13.950
My bookies were gonna
kill me, so that’s...

15:13.950 --> 15:16.490
extenuating circumstances
or whatever, right?

15:16.490 --> 15:17.580
It’s practically self-defense.

15:17.580 --> 15:19.540
Uh, let’s keep talking
about The Theban.

15:19.540 --> 15:21.490
Can you give us
a description?

15:21.490 --> 15:22.700
Sorry.

15:22.700 --> 15:24.450
We never met in person.

15:24.450 --> 15:25.410
We used Zyngychat.

15:25.410 --> 15:27.250
It’s one of those texting apps
that deletes

15:27.250 --> 15:28.660
the messages
as soon as you read ’em.

15:28.660 --> 15:30.950
Perfect for irresponsible
teenagers and hired killers.

15:30.950 --> 15:33.490
There was something different
about this last job.

15:33.490 --> 15:34.700
The other two times, he gave me

15:34.700 --> 15:36.490
a detailed description
of what he wanted--

15:36.490 --> 15:39.490
how old the target should be,
male or female.

15:39.490 --> 15:40.490
He wanted them short,

15:40.490 --> 15:42.500
no pacemakers
or artificial hips,

15:42.500 --> 15:45.450
Middle-Eastern--
preferably Egyptian.

15:45.450 --> 15:47.490
To match the mummy
he was making.

15:47.490 --> 15:49.490
I’d look for someone
who fit the bill

15:49.490 --> 15:51.450
and killed them the way
The Theban wanted.

15:51.450 --> 15:53.370
This time, he already
picked out his victim.

15:53.370 --> 15:55.120
It was this girl
named Mischa Farrell.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.500
Graphic designer, late 20s,
lived in Kip’s Bay.

15:57.500 --> 15:59.490
Anyway, I caught her
on the way home

15:59.490 --> 16:01.000
from a club the other night.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.580
Cut her right here.

16:02.580 --> 16:05.160
Tucked her body away
and told The Theban

16:05.160 --> 16:06.500
where to pick her up.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.620
So, we got a deal?

16:08.620 --> 16:10.580
Do I need
to sign something?

16:10.580 --> 16:11.910
Show it to a lawyer?

16:11.910 --> 16:15.490
Hey, I should probably
have a lawyer, right?

16:18.910 --> 16:20.490
Never had a suspect
who wanted

16:20.490 --> 16:23.330
to cooperate so badly
and knew so little.

16:23.330 --> 16:25.790
Well, didn’t give us
much about The Theban,

16:25.790 --> 16:27.250
that’s for sure.

16:27.250 --> 16:29.000
Not much,
but perhaps enough.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.950
Mischa Farrell
broke The Theban’s pattern

16:30.950 --> 16:32.490
in more ways than one.
Just look.

16:32.490 --> 16:35.040
BELL:
Doesn’t exactly look Egyptian.

16:35.040 --> 16:36.870
She might have some
Middle-Eastern heritage,

16:36.870 --> 16:39.080
but at least some
of her ancestors hailed

16:39.080 --> 16:40.490
from less sunny climes.

16:40.490 --> 16:41.750
Also, she was
five-foot-six.

16:41.750 --> 16:42.790
That’s a good deal taller

16:42.790 --> 16:44.370
than your average
ancient Egyptian woman.

16:44.370 --> 16:47.040
But The Theban specifically
ordered Blaine to kill her.

16:47.040 --> 16:49.950
Why do that if she didn’t
fit his requirements?

16:49.950 --> 16:51.750
Well, what if
her death was more

16:51.750 --> 16:54.000
than just a step
in creating an ersatz mummy?

16:54.000 --> 16:56.160
What if it was a goal
in and of itself?

16:56.160 --> 16:59.410
You’re thinking, even though
Blaine in there doesn’t know it,

16:59.410 --> 17:01.490
Mischa Farrell’s murder
was a hit.

17:01.490 --> 17:03.080
Figure out who
wanted her dead,

17:03.080 --> 17:06.160
and we may have
our mummy maker.

17:07.480 --> 17:09.270
WATSON:
Those are new.
Are you reopening

17:09.270 --> 17:12.440
the investigation
into the death of Sobekneferu?

17:12.640 --> 17:14.220
No, this is actually
everything we know

17:14.319 --> 17:15.319
about Mischa Farrell.

17:16.319 --> 17:18.490
Since we weren’t making
any progress last night

17:18.490 --> 17:20.450
reviewing the details
of her life in English,

17:20.450 --> 17:23.359
I thought I would translate
the data into hieroglyphics.

17:23.359 --> 17:25.690
See if it opened up a
new line of thought.

17:25.690 --> 17:26.450
To review,

17:26.450 --> 17:28.240
Mischa Farrell was a 29-year-old

17:28.240 --> 17:30.740
freelance book designer
who did covers and layouts

17:30.740 --> 17:33.490
for fine-art books,
textbooks and auction catalogs.

17:33.490 --> 17:36.570
Hmm. No apparent issues
with drugs or alcohol.

17:36.570 --> 17:38.740
Single. No evidence
of domestic abuse.

17:38.740 --> 17:41.240
No priors,
which is why her prints

17:41.240 --> 17:42.780
weren’t in any of the databases.

17:42.780 --> 17:44.990
And while her profession does
connect her to the art world,

17:44.990 --> 17:46.450
there seems to be
no reason on earth

17:46.450 --> 17:47.690
why anyone would want
to kill her,

17:47.690 --> 17:49.740
so we must be
missing something.

17:49.740 --> 17:51.200
Uh, are these her
bank statements?

17:51.500 --> 17:53.440
Yes. Marcus sent them over
a few moments ago.

17:53.540 --> 17:54.660
That was my next project.

17:54.660 --> 17:58.990
Looks like she hired a lawyer
a little over a year ago.

17:59.250 --> 18:00.620
And then about
five months later,

18:00.620 --> 18:04.580
she received a check for $75,000
from the same law firm.

18:04.580 --> 18:05.700
Maybe it was
a settlement.

18:05.700 --> 18:06.750
Certainly merits a closer look.

18:06.750 --> 18:08.620
Let me know
if you find anything.

18:08.620 --> 18:09.450
Where are you going?

18:09.450 --> 18:11.410
My father wants me
to attend a meeting

18:11.410 --> 18:12.990
with him and his attorneys.

18:12.990 --> 18:15.950
I leave this
in your capable hands.

18:17.950 --> 18:21.990
Yes, that $75,000 came from me,
and yes, it was a settlement.

18:21.990 --> 18:24.200
But I never
would have hurt Mischa.

18:24.200 --> 18:25.330
I cared about her.

18:25.330 --> 18:27.500
More like you relentlessly
sexually harassed her

18:27.500 --> 18:28.750
when she worked
with you.

18:28.750 --> 18:30.700
We’ve seen the lawsuit,
Mr. Venetto.

18:30.700 --> 18:32.580
We know that on
multiple occasions

18:32.580 --> 18:33.990
you tried
to pressure her

18:33.990 --> 18:35.160
into sleeping with you.

18:35.160 --> 18:37.500
Maybe you resented
having to pay her out.

18:37.500 --> 18:40.370
Maybe you just didn’t like
being rejected.

18:40.370 --> 18:41.990
Either way, you decided

18:41.990 --> 18:43.990
she had to go.

18:43.990 --> 18:45.500
Uh...

18:45.500 --> 18:50.500
I was horrible to Mischa,
and to other women, too,

18:50.500 --> 18:52.620
but I had no reason to kill her.

18:52.620 --> 18:54.870
If anything, I was
grateful to her.

18:54.870 --> 18:58.370
Her lawsuit made me take
a hard look at myself,

18:58.370 --> 19:00.750
and I didn’t like what I saw.

19:00.750 --> 19:01.950
That’s why I settled.

19:01.950 --> 19:05.200
Not just with her, but with
the other women I’d harassed.

19:05.200 --> 19:07.410
Even the ones who
hadn’t sued me.

19:07.410 --> 19:08.450
If you’d like,

19:08.450 --> 19:11.080
I’ll e-mail
my attorneys right now,

19:11.080 --> 19:14.660
ask them to send you
all of their records.

19:15.870 --> 19:19.200
My e-mail address
is at the bottom.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.660
Try to understand, I’ve had

19:21.660 --> 19:24.200
extensive counseling
over the past year.

19:24.200 --> 19:28.410
I’ve changed how I conduct
my business completely.

19:28.410 --> 19:30.450
You know Mischa
was freelancing

19:30.450 --> 19:31.750
for me again, right?

19:31.750 --> 19:32.700
Well, we saw a few checks.

19:32.700 --> 19:35.080
We thought they might
have been more payoffs.

19:35.080 --> 19:38.700
She designed my last
three auction catalogs.

19:38.700 --> 19:40.830
Uh... ah, here.

19:40.830 --> 19:43.040
See for yourself.

19:43.580 --> 19:44.990
Since she’s
been back,

19:44.990 --> 19:48.080
everything’s been strictly
professional between us.

19:48.080 --> 19:49.080
Ask anyone.

19:49.080 --> 19:52.200
Does the name "The Theban"
mean anything to you?

19:52.200 --> 19:54.580
No. Should it?
BELL: That’s the person

19:54.580 --> 19:55.750
we think hired Mischa’s killer.

19:55.750 --> 19:56.990
WATSON: Can you think
of anyone else

19:56.990 --> 19:59.580
who might have wanted
to hurt Mischa?

19:59.580 --> 20:01.200
You talked to Ricky?
Who?

20:01.200 --> 20:02.120
Mischa’s ex.

20:02.120 --> 20:04.250
From what she told people
around the office,

20:04.250 --> 20:05.330
they had an ugly breakup.

20:05.330 --> 20:08.950
Something about Ricky
owing her money.

20:08.950 --> 20:10.120
WOMAN:I admit...

20:10.120 --> 20:12.990
I lashed out at Mischa
after she dumped me.

20:12.990 --> 20:17.160
She called our relationship
"a failed experiment."

20:17.160 --> 20:19.290
So I said
some stupid things,

20:19.290 --> 20:21.910
but I never
wanted her dead.

20:21.910 --> 20:23.080
Truth is...

20:23.080 --> 20:25.990
I don’t think
I ever stopped loving her.

20:25.990 --> 20:28.000
Is that why you called her
the day she disappeared?

20:28.000 --> 20:30.660
BELL: Ricky, we got
Mischa’s phone records.

20:30.660 --> 20:34.990
Mischa is the one
who reached out to me. Okay?

20:34.990 --> 20:37.910
Weeks ago. There was this book
she was working on.

20:37.910 --> 20:39.870
She wanted me
to consult on it.

20:39.870 --> 20:42.830
She said she would forget
all about the 20 grand.

20:42.830 --> 20:43.950
I said yes.

20:43.950 --> 20:46.040
Must have needed your help
pretty badly

20:46.040 --> 20:47.910
to forgive a debt that big.

20:47.910 --> 20:50.290
She needed someone
who really knew brush strokes.

20:50.290 --> 20:54.040
Therewas a trick I used to do
when we were in grad school.

20:54.040 --> 20:55.580
In art classes,
I could tell

20:55.580 --> 20:57.870
who painted what
by the brush strokes.

20:57.870 --> 21:00.750
That’s what she wanted me
to do for the book.

21:00.750 --> 21:03.410
Identify painters by
their brush strokes?

21:03.410 --> 21:05.290
One painter,
actually.

21:05.290 --> 21:08.200
The book is something
she was writing herself.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.700
Nonfiction.

21:09.700 --> 21:12.040
An exposé
on this forger.

21:12.040 --> 21:15.540
Mischa called him "van Faux."

21:15.540 --> 21:16.870
Van Faux.

21:16.870 --> 21:17.700
According to her,

21:17.700 --> 21:20.990
he is the world’s greatest
living forger.

21:20.990 --> 21:23.160
He imitates the old masters:

21:23.160 --> 21:26.370
Rubens, Rembrandt,
the Brueghels.

21:26.370 --> 21:28.330
Mischa claimed
that van Faux’s fakes

21:28.330 --> 21:31.080
are pretty much a part
of every major collection

21:31.080 --> 21:32.410
of Dutch paintings,

21:32.410 --> 21:33.990
and no one knows it.

21:33.990 --> 21:35.990
She was trying
to identify every one.

21:35.990 --> 21:36.990
That’s where I came in.

21:36.990 --> 21:41.990
I can spot his fakes sometimes
by the brush stokes.

21:41.990 --> 21:42.950
Thing is...

21:42.950 --> 21:46.950
Mischa didn’t just want
to identify van Faux’s work.

21:46.950 --> 21:49.370
She wanted
to find out his real name.

21:49.370 --> 21:51.410
Expose him
to the world.

21:51.410 --> 21:55.330
If Mischa found out
who van Faux really is...

21:55.330 --> 21:59.200
He might have killed her
to protect his secrets.

22:03.990 --> 22:05.830
You’re upset.

22:05.830 --> 22:07.200
I’m disappointed.

22:07.200 --> 22:09.620
I think you’re
making a mistake

22:09.620 --> 22:11.120
passing up
your inheritance.

22:11.120 --> 22:12.990
The truth is I
would much rather

22:12.990 --> 22:14.080
the proceeds
go to charity.

22:14.080 --> 22:17.410
I certainly don’t
need the money.

22:17.410 --> 22:19.660
All I require is...

22:19.660 --> 22:21.990
"A loaf of bread
and a clean collar."

22:21.990 --> 22:25.620
As you’ve said
many times before.

22:26.200 --> 22:29.410
Still I’m grateful
that you took the time

22:29.410 --> 22:30.700
to join me today.

22:30.700 --> 22:34.910
My inevitable passing
is hardly my favorite subject,

22:34.910 --> 22:39.000
but I’m glad
your wishes will be met.

22:39.540 --> 22:42.580
Well, I’m sure you need
to get back to your work.

22:42.580 --> 22:45.370
So... thank you
for taking the time.

22:45.370 --> 22:47.750
I’m just gonna wait till
your car gets here,

22:47.750 --> 22:49.250
if it’s all the same to you.

22:49.250 --> 22:52.870
Oh. Yeah, of course.

22:52.870 --> 22:54.330
Yes.

23:03.410 --> 23:06.200
I assume from your texts
these are the works

23:06.200 --> 23:08.000
of the elusive van Faux.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.200
The ones that Mischa’s ex
knew about, anyway.

23:11.200 --> 23:13.540
I can see why Mischa
was fascinated by him.

23:13.540 --> 23:14.450
He’s really good.

23:14.450 --> 23:16.990
He doesn’t just copy
existing paintings.

23:16.990 --> 23:18.040
He paints
brand-new ones

23:18.040 --> 23:20.080
in the style of different
Dutch old masters,

23:20.080 --> 23:23.040
and then passes them off
as lost masterpieces.

23:23.040 --> 23:24.450
A not uncommon approach
for forgers.

23:24.450 --> 23:26.660
It’s technically demanding,
but...

23:26.660 --> 23:28.990
makes spotting a forgery
more difficult.

23:28.990 --> 23:30.990
So, how’d it go
with your father?

23:30.990 --> 23:33.500
Aside from a slight disagreement
regarding his estate,

23:33.500 --> 23:34.750
we had a not unpleasant morning.

23:34.750 --> 23:38.200
Right up until the moment
I realized he was being stalked.

23:38.200 --> 23:39.500
What do you mean?

23:39.500 --> 23:42.700
When we left the meeting,
I saw a man lingering nearby,

23:42.700 --> 23:44.660
studying my father intently.

23:44.660 --> 23:46.870
I believe he intended him ill.

23:46.870 --> 23:47.950
Did you tell your father?

23:47.950 --> 23:49.790
Didn’t want to risk
tipping my hand.

23:49.790 --> 23:52.830
Finding and identifying this man
will require a detective,

23:52.830 --> 23:55.370
and while my father
has a virtual Death Star

23:55.370 --> 23:57.410
at his disposal,
I have little faith

23:57.410 --> 23:59.250
in the investigative arm
of his group.

23:59.250 --> 24:02.750
So I trust you could do
without me for a stretch.

24:02.750 --> 24:03.660
Sure.

24:03.660 --> 24:06.580
Gonna start an art project
of my own.

24:11.200 --> 24:13.160
WATSON:
Nice use of shading.

24:13.160 --> 24:16.080
Have you considered a career
in art forgery?

24:16.080 --> 24:17.580
This is merely a tool,

24:17.580 --> 24:20.410
a visual aid I plan
to forward to my contacts.

24:20.410 --> 24:21.540
How goes your investigation?

24:21.540 --> 24:23.250
I’ve been looking
into the provenances

24:23.250 --> 24:25.990
of the paintings
that Mischa thought

24:25.990 --> 24:27.660
were forgeries by van Faux.

24:27.660 --> 24:30.040
Most of them have histories
that allegedly date back

24:30.040 --> 24:32.700
to the Second World War,
and then nothing.

24:32.700 --> 24:34.620
The histories of many European
works of art

24:34.620 --> 24:36.120
were lost or destroyed
during the war.

24:36.120 --> 24:37.990
Van Faux is no doubt aware
of this

24:37.990 --> 24:39.120
and using it to his advantage.

24:39.120 --> 24:41.580
I thought the same thing,
so instead of looking

24:41.580 --> 24:43.370
at the paintings
to try and find him,

24:43.370 --> 24:45.080
I started looking
into the materials

24:45.080 --> 24:46.370
he would use to forge them.

24:46.370 --> 24:48.950
Period-accurate paints,
varnishes, brushes?

24:48.950 --> 24:50.500
Unfortunately,
I struck out there, too.

24:50.500 --> 24:53.540
I checked with all the companies
that would make those materials,

24:53.540 --> 24:55.200
but none of them points
to van Faux.

24:55.200 --> 24:56.950
There’s no regular buyers
of the colors

24:56.950 --> 24:59.700
used by Rembrandt or Rubens,
and no special requests

24:59.700 --> 25:01.950
that would match
a Vermeer or Brueghel.

25:01.950 --> 25:02.830
What about canvases?

25:02.830 --> 25:04.370
There are exactly
five places

25:04.370 --> 25:05.540
that make the reproductions

25:05.540 --> 25:07.950
of the linen canvases
used during the 17th century,

25:07.950 --> 25:11.870
but none of them seem to have
any connection to van Faux.

25:11.870 --> 25:13.620
Well, they wouldn’t.

25:13.620 --> 25:14.990
Not if the canvases he’s using

25:14.990 --> 25:18.790
are actually
from the 17th century.

25:21.910 --> 25:25.750
So your theory is that
van Faux has a time machine?

25:25.750 --> 25:27.450
The frames
around these paintings

25:27.450 --> 25:28.990
appear to be quite old.

25:28.990 --> 25:29.990
Yeah, I noticed that, too.

25:29.990 --> 25:31.700
I just assumed he aged them.

25:31.700 --> 25:32.990
Well, he could have.

25:32.990 --> 25:34.410
But why go to all the trouble?

25:34.410 --> 25:35.500
Why age new canvases and frames

25:35.500 --> 25:36.990
when you could just
buy old ones?

25:36.990 --> 25:39.990
What, you can buy frames
and blank canvases

25:39.990 --> 25:41.500
from the 17th century?

25:41.500 --> 25:42.990
No, but you can buy lesser-known

25:42.990 --> 25:46.040
17th century paintings
for a few thousand dollars,

25:46.040 --> 25:47.950
frames and canvases included.

25:47.950 --> 25:49.160
So you think he buys
old paintings,

25:49.160 --> 25:50.990
and then strips them
or paints over them?

25:50.990 --> 25:53.160
If anything, it would add
to the authenticity

25:53.160 --> 25:54.200
of van Faux’s work.

25:54.200 --> 25:56.870
Old masters often reused
frames and canvases.

25:56.870 --> 25:58.120
So the question
then becomes--

25:58.120 --> 26:01.950
who has been buying up
all the least desirable

26:01.950 --> 26:05.500
Dutch paintings from the 1600s?

26:07.000 --> 26:07.990
(door opens, bell rings)

26:07.990 --> 26:10.200
Class doesn’t start
for another hour.

26:10.200 --> 26:12.580
GREGSON: We’re not here
for a class, Mr. Wells.

26:12.580 --> 26:14.990
We’re here to talk to you
about some paintings

26:14.990 --> 26:16.370
you recently bought
that we think

26:16.370 --> 26:17.660
you were gonna turn
into forgeries.

26:17.660 --> 26:19.870
I’m Captain Gregson
with the NYPD.

26:19.870 --> 26:22.990
This is Detectives Bell,
Lewis and Orosco.

26:22.990 --> 26:25.540
Would it help if I told you
I have no idea

26:25.540 --> 26:27.990
what you’re talking about?
BELL: Not really.

26:27.990 --> 26:30.700
We have a search warrant for
this studio and your residence.

26:30.700 --> 26:32.990
If you’re working
on any forged paintings

26:32.990 --> 26:34.990
at the moment, pretty sure

26:34.990 --> 26:36.080
we’re gonna find them.

26:36.080 --> 26:38.990
Mischa told you about me,
didn’t she?

26:38.990 --> 26:40.990
You admit to knowing
Mischa Farrell?

26:40.990 --> 26:43.910
I have a feeling
there’s no point in denying it.

26:43.910 --> 26:45.990
GREGSON: She didn’t
tell us anything.

26:45.990 --> 26:48.870
The work she was doing
did help us find you,

26:48.870 --> 26:51.330
which means you had her killed

26:51.330 --> 26:52.830
for nothing.

26:52.830 --> 26:53.990
What?

26:53.990 --> 26:56.910
What are you talking about?

26:58.990 --> 26:59.990
Mischa’s dead?

26:59.990 --> 27:01.870
BELL:
I’m curious,
Mr. Wells.

27:01.870 --> 27:04.540
Are paintings the only thing
you forge,

27:04.540 --> 27:07.660
or do you also like
to fake Egyptian antiquities?

27:07.660 --> 27:09.580
You admit you knew
Mischa Farrell.

27:09.580 --> 27:11.410
We think you also knew
she was getting closer

27:11.410 --> 27:14.660
to proving you were the forger
she called van Faux.

27:14.660 --> 27:17.160
She’d identified dozens
of your fakes.

27:17.160 --> 27:18.200
She was a threat to you.

27:18.200 --> 27:20.540
It’s true I knew
about her research

27:20.540 --> 27:21.990
because she told me.

27:21.990 --> 27:23.290
She was determined to prove

27:23.290 --> 27:25.500
I was the world’s greatest
living forger,

27:25.500 --> 27:26.830
and she wouldn’t be dissuaded,

27:26.830 --> 27:28.990
no matter how
much I denied it.

27:28.990 --> 27:30.870
But I would never

27:30.870 --> 27:31.910
have harmed her.

27:31.910 --> 27:34.870
Quite the contrary--
I would have killed anybody

27:34.870 --> 27:37.580
who I thought
might be a threat to her.

27:37.580 --> 27:39.790
You admit you knew
she was trying to expose you,

27:39.790 --> 27:42.990
so why should we believe
you’d want to protect her?

27:42.990 --> 27:46.410
Because that’s what fathers do.

27:46.990 --> 27:50.950
Mischa Farrell was my daughter.

27:55.900 --> 27:58.570
I met Mischa’s mother
at a Basquiat show

27:58.570 --> 28:00.150
in the East Village.
Back then, I was

28:00.150 --> 28:02.990
an up-and-coming painter
on the local scene.

28:02.990 --> 28:05.360
She was the most
beautiful thing

28:05.360 --> 28:07.650
I had ever
laid eyes on, and...

28:07.650 --> 28:09.690
we had a
one-night stand.

28:09.690 --> 28:11.490
Mischa arrived
nine months later.

28:11.490 --> 28:14.070
BELL:
We pulled Mischa’s
birth certificate

28:14.070 --> 28:15.150
to check your story.

28:15.150 --> 28:16.200
You’re not on it.

28:16.200 --> 28:19.320
Her mother’s decision,
which I respected.

28:19.320 --> 28:21.690
But I still wanted
to do right by Mischa.

28:21.690 --> 28:24.150
So, when it became painfully
clear that I would

28:24.150 --> 28:27.690
never make a living
as a legitimate artist,

28:27.690 --> 28:28.820
I turned to forgery.

28:28.820 --> 28:32.600
I used the profits to pay
Mischa’s child support.

28:33.510 --> 28:35.760
Eventually, her mother
trusted me enough

28:35.760 --> 28:39.090
to watch her after school
and weekends.

28:39.090 --> 28:40.850
She practically grew up
in my studio.

28:40.850 --> 28:42.470
HOLMES:
And that’s how,
as an adult,

28:42.470 --> 28:44.300
she came to recognize
that your forgeries

28:44.300 --> 28:46.800
were being passed off
as genuine old masters?

28:46.800 --> 28:48.850
As a child,
she had seen me paint them,

28:48.850 --> 28:52.930
and a few months ago,
she confronted me.

28:52.930 --> 28:54.350
She was angry?

28:54.350 --> 28:56.090
Quite the opposite.

28:56.090 --> 28:57.760
She was proud of my work.

28:57.760 --> 29:02.640
To her, I was every bit as good
as the artists I imitated.

29:02.640 --> 29:03.850
She wanted me to go public.

29:03.850 --> 29:07.090
She thought, if I cooperated
with the authorities,

29:07.090 --> 29:09.090
I’d be spared a prison sentence.

29:09.090 --> 29:10.800
More importantly,
I’d finally

29:10.800 --> 29:13.180
be acknowledged
for my talent.

29:13.180 --> 29:15.300
Other admitted forgers
have become

29:15.300 --> 29:18.100
successful mainstream
artists, you see.

29:18.100 --> 29:22.220
She wanted me to get the credit
she thought I deserved.

29:22.220 --> 29:23.640
But you refused?

29:23.640 --> 29:26.090
Unfortunately,
she wasn’t the sort

29:26.090 --> 29:27.850
to take no for an answer.

29:27.850 --> 29:31.430
She set about trying
to prove I was van Faux.

29:31.430 --> 29:34.090
I did everything I could
to discourage her.

29:34.090 --> 29:37.090
So you admit she was a threat
and that you tried

29:37.090 --> 29:39.890
to shut her down
to protect yourself.

29:39.890 --> 29:41.970
I tried to protect her.

29:41.970 --> 29:44.260
Few people understand
how dangerous

29:44.260 --> 29:46.510
the business of art can be.

29:46.510 --> 29:50.050
Criminals, oligarchs,
despots, terrorists.

29:50.050 --> 29:52.600
They all use art
to move their dirty money

29:52.660 --> 29:54.250
from place to place.

29:54.250 --> 29:58.620
Pay each other for guns,
drugs, stolen goods.

29:59.200 --> 30:00.490
If Mischa had exposed you,

30:00.490 --> 30:02.330
the collectors
who own your forgeries

30:02.330 --> 30:03.370
would have lost millions.

30:03.370 --> 30:06.330
Maybe one of them realized
what she was trying to do,

30:06.330 --> 30:08.490
had her killed to
keep her quiet.

30:08.490 --> 30:09.830
WELLS:
I don’t deal directly

30:09.830 --> 30:11.910
with any of the monsters
who lurk

30:11.910 --> 30:14.160
in the art world shadows.

30:14.160 --> 30:16.120
But I know many by reputation.

30:16.120 --> 30:19.490
Perhaps, if you tell me
more about her death,

30:19.490 --> 30:22.490
I might be able to
shed some light.

30:23.660 --> 30:27.490
Well, she was killed
with a weapon called a khopesh.

30:27.490 --> 30:28.500
When we found her body,

30:28.500 --> 30:30.830
someone was trying
to turn it into a replica

30:30.830 --> 30:32.490
of an ancient mummy.

30:32.490 --> 30:34.490
HOLMES: The person
we believe is responsible

30:34.490 --> 30:37.120
is a forger
known only as The Theban.

30:37.120 --> 30:38.870
WELLS:
I’ve heard of him.

30:38.870 --> 30:41.370
He forges Levantine antiquities.

30:41.370 --> 30:45.490
The coffin of Mary Magdalene,
the Akhenaten Papyrus,

30:45.490 --> 30:47.450
head of the Golden Calf.

30:47.450 --> 30:48.490
Those were all him.

30:48.490 --> 30:50.250
Do you know his real name?

30:50.250 --> 30:51.500
No one does.

30:51.500 --> 30:53.120
But there is one thing, however,

30:53.120 --> 30:55.700
that sets The Theban apart
from other forgers.

30:55.700 --> 30:58.200
According to rumor,
he has a way

30:58.200 --> 30:59.660
to fool carbon-14 dating.

30:59.660 --> 31:04.080
It’s how he makes his work
seem suitably ancient.

31:04.080 --> 31:05.200
If you can figure out

31:05.200 --> 31:09.870
how he does that,
it might lead you to him.

31:09.870 --> 31:10.830
Rubbish.

31:10.830 --> 31:13.790
There’s just no way
to fake radio carbon dating.

31:13.790 --> 31:16.000
The test measures the age
of an object

31:16.000 --> 31:18.660
based on the rate
of radioactive decay.

31:18.660 --> 31:20.120
You can’t speed that rate up.

31:20.120 --> 31:21.580
If you could,
Chernobyl and Fukushima

31:21.580 --> 31:23.540
would’ve been
cleaned up over night.

31:23.540 --> 31:24.620
HOLMES:
That being said,

31:24.620 --> 31:26.490
it was clear that
Mr. Wells thought

31:26.490 --> 31:27.830
what he was saying
to be true.

31:27.830 --> 31:29.870
So I reached out to some
contacts in the art world,

31:29.870 --> 31:32.000
and a few of them
had heard the same rumors.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
That The Theban
could somehow fool the test.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.870
Which made us wonder--
what if the rumors

31:36.870 --> 31:38.750
were started
by The Theban himself?

31:38.750 --> 31:40.750
HOLMES:
In other words,
what if he was

31:40.750 --> 31:42.330
propagating some
nonsensical story

31:42.330 --> 31:44.700
in order to hide the
truth about how he

31:44.700 --> 31:46.250
was circumventing
authentication?

31:46.250 --> 31:48.490
He might not be
able to bend

31:48.490 --> 31:49.490
the rules of physics,

31:49.490 --> 31:53.040
but he could compromise
the person who’s applying them.

31:53.040 --> 31:56.250
You think he uses
a crooked authenticator?

31:56.250 --> 31:58.200
WATSON: We looked into
the few known forgeries

31:58.200 --> 31:59.500
that had been connected
to The Theban.

31:59.500 --> 32:01.750
In particular the three
that Jasper mentioned.

32:01.750 --> 32:03.490
HOLMES:
The coffin of
Mary Magdalene,

32:03.490 --> 32:06.410
the Akhenaten Papyrus
and the head of the Golden Calf.

32:06.410 --> 32:09.490
All three were authenticated
by the same person.

32:09.490 --> 32:10.660
Your friend,

32:10.660 --> 32:12.500
Professor Hausmann.

32:12.500 --> 32:13.490
You’re kidding.

32:13.490 --> 32:15.490
He tried to convince us
that Mischa’s death

32:15.490 --> 32:16.580
wasn’t a murder, remember?

32:16.580 --> 32:18.490
Just like he
would if he were

32:18.490 --> 32:20.200
in business with The Theban.

32:20.200 --> 32:21.830
Now, if he is
on The Theban’s payroll,

32:21.830 --> 32:23.830
he’d be our best chance
at locating him.

32:23.830 --> 32:25.500
I’ll call him right now.

32:25.500 --> 32:28.250
Tell him we need him
to come in here

32:28.250 --> 32:29.080
for another consult.

32:29.080 --> 32:31.160
No need.
Marcus is already on it.

32:31.160 --> 32:33.040
(door opens)

32:33.490 --> 32:34.490
We have a problem.

32:34.490 --> 32:37.490
Hausmann is at
St. Bede’s Hospital.

32:37.490 --> 32:39.500
Someone shot him.

32:39.500 --> 32:41.490
Detective who caught the case

32:41.490 --> 32:43.540
just walked me
through her notes.

32:43.540 --> 32:44.540
Hausmann was shot

32:44.540 --> 32:46.870
while walking his dog
in Central Park

32:46.870 --> 32:47.660
around 5:00 a.m.

32:47.660 --> 32:49.750
No witnesses.
HOLMES: Gets worse.

32:49.750 --> 32:51.080
He died in surgery.

32:51.080 --> 32:54.120
Gotta figure The Theban
was the shooter, right?

32:54.120 --> 32:55.700
He was tying up loose ends.

32:55.700 --> 32:57.830
I’m not so sure
The Theban did this.

32:57.830 --> 33:00.580
They found extensive scarring
in Hausmann’s lungs.

33:00.580 --> 33:01.750
I saw this kind of damage

33:01.750 --> 33:04.120
back when I was a surgeon--
in a metalworker.

33:04.120 --> 33:05.910
There’s a couple things
that could have caused it.

33:05.910 --> 33:09.330
One of them is chronic
potassium sulfide inhalation.

33:09.330 --> 33:10.750
Potassium sulfide is
used to patina bronze,

33:10.750 --> 33:13.450
but it can also be used
to artificially age

33:13.450 --> 33:15.750
metallic objects to
make them look ancient.

33:15.750 --> 33:18.580
A burial mask of a forged
mummy, for example.

33:18.580 --> 33:19.750
Well, the people
who found

33:19.750 --> 33:22.410
The Theban’s workshop said he
was wearing a respirator,

33:22.410 --> 33:25.000
so maybe he knew
about the damage to his lungs

33:25.000 --> 33:26.580
and was taking precautions.

33:26.580 --> 33:29.040
Hausmann wasn’t working
for The Theban.

33:29.040 --> 33:30.660
He was The Theban.

33:32.040 --> 33:33.250
Say you’re right.

33:33.250 --> 33:34.370
Who the hell killed him?

33:34.370 --> 33:36.080
Maybe what you said before
was right--

33:36.080 --> 33:37.290
The Theban was just a middleman.

33:37.290 --> 33:39.910
So someone who owns a bunch
of Jasper Wells’s forgeries

33:39.910 --> 33:42.490
hired The Theban to arrange
Mischa Farrell’s murder,

33:42.490 --> 33:44.490
then killed him to make sure
he never talked.

33:44.490 --> 33:46.490
If that’s correct,
that would greatly narrow

33:46.490 --> 33:47.500
the parameters of our search.

33:47.500 --> 33:50.700
We’d be looking for someone
who had a good deal to lose

33:50.700 --> 33:53.490
if Mischa exposed
her father’s fakes.
(cell phone dings)

33:53.490 --> 33:55.490
And who had a relationship
with The Theban.

33:55.490 --> 33:57.660
HOLMES: Speaking of
identifying dangerous men,

33:57.660 --> 34:00.120
I’ve had some feedback
on my art project.

34:00.120 --> 34:02.120
Gotta go.

34:03.540 --> 34:05.490
What’s that about?

34:05.490 --> 34:07.910
It’s family business.

34:07.910 --> 34:09.699
Come on.

34:10.989 --> 34:13.199
This is one of mine.

34:15.080 --> 34:17.500
This is real.

34:18.989 --> 34:20.500
Hmm. Keep going.

34:20.500 --> 34:22.989
I’ll be right back.

34:29.500 --> 34:30.500
Hey.

34:31.100 --> 34:33.050
Was CCS able to break
into Hausmann’s phone?

34:33.050 --> 34:34.389
The phone and more.

34:34.389 --> 34:35.889
They got access to
his financials,

34:35.889 --> 34:36.969
including an
offshore account

34:36.969 --> 34:38.850
he used for his
forgery business.

34:38.850 --> 34:41.590
No doubt about it--
he was The Theban.

34:41.590 --> 34:43.600
Few days before
Mischa Farrell was killed,

34:43.600 --> 34:46.590
he received 50 grand from
someone else’s offshore account.

34:46.590 --> 34:49.600
Few hours later, he
transferred that same amount

34:49.600 --> 34:50.719
to Blaine Geary.

34:50.719 --> 34:52.719
So he was just a middleman.

34:52.719 --> 34:54.429
How’s it going
with Mr. Wells?

34:54.429 --> 34:56.179
Find anyone who
owns his forgeries

34:56.179 --> 34:58.300
and might have a
connection to The Theban?

34:58.300 --> 34:59.390
Well, the overlap between

34:59.390 --> 35:00.890
collectors
of Dutch old masters

35:00.890 --> 35:02.600
and collectors
of Egyptian antiquities

35:02.600 --> 35:03.590
is virtually nil.

35:03.590 --> 35:05.300
And there’s no indication
that the ones

35:05.300 --> 35:06.590
who bought fakes
painted by Jasper

35:06.590 --> 35:07.720
have been trying
to move them.

35:07.720 --> 35:10.680
So it makes me think we’re
looking in the wrong place.

35:11.680 --> 35:13.010
What do you mean?

35:13.010 --> 35:14.220
The odds that someone

35:14.220 --> 35:16.470
unknowingly bought a fake
from one forger

35:16.470 --> 35:19.260
and has a relationship
with another are slim.

35:19.260 --> 35:21.140
Well, who else would
have lost money

35:21.140 --> 35:22.800
if Mischa Farrell
exposed her dad?

35:22.800 --> 35:23.850
Jasper’s been telling me

35:23.850 --> 35:25.890
a little about
how he does business.

35:25.890 --> 35:28.220
He never deals directly
with big collectors.

35:28.220 --> 35:30.470
Instead, he uses middlemen
and cutouts.

35:30.470 --> 35:31.720
You’re thinking
the killer isn’t

35:31.720 --> 35:33.260
someone who bought
Jasper’s fakes,

35:33.260 --> 35:34.590
but someone who
helped sell them?

35:34.590 --> 35:37.510
Imagine you knowingly
sold fakes to criminals.

35:37.510 --> 35:38.800
I mean, you’d be
pretty nervous, too,

35:38.800 --> 35:41.760
if you found out about the book
that Mischa was working on.

35:41.760 --> 35:43.180
Yeah, one of your
clients reads it,

35:43.180 --> 35:44.590
you’re the one who
could wind up dead.

35:44.590 --> 35:47.590
So you kill Mischa
to make sure that never happens.

35:47.590 --> 35:49.010
The kind of person
you’re talking about

35:49.010 --> 35:51.600
would also be more likely
to know The Theban.

35:51.600 --> 35:53.100
Sounds to me like we
should ask Jasper

35:53.100 --> 35:55.970
if we could take a look
at his contact list.

36:06.600 --> 36:08.590
How were you planning
to kill my father?

36:08.590 --> 36:12.590
Heart attack or...
something more creative?

36:12.590 --> 36:14.590
You’re the son.

36:14.590 --> 36:16.590
Sherlock Holmes.

36:16.590 --> 36:18.260
Fleeing is pointless.

36:18.260 --> 36:21.760
The hotel exits have
been secured by MI6.

36:21.760 --> 36:24.390
They helped me identify you.

36:24.390 --> 36:26.930
Your name is Vanja Borozan.

36:26.930 --> 36:29.010
You are a high-priced
assassin.

36:29.010 --> 36:30.590
You’re a disciple

36:30.590 --> 36:31.680
of Daniel Gottlieb,

36:31.680 --> 36:34.590
the killer known
as "The Actuary."

36:34.590 --> 36:37.640
And you just locked yourself
in a room with me.

36:37.640 --> 36:41.590
Well, as you can see,
I’ve disabled your weapon.

36:41.590 --> 36:43.590
And I’m confident
I would prevail

36:43.590 --> 36:44.600
in a physical confrontation.

36:44.600 --> 36:47.890
I have other ways
of eliminating a threat.

36:47.890 --> 36:52.140
Yes, I’m well aware of your
particular modus operandi.

36:52.140 --> 36:54.640
Like your mentor,
you prefer your murders

36:54.640 --> 36:57.760
to look like accidents
or natural causes.

36:57.760 --> 37:00.720
So, as long as I don’t
let you approach me

37:00.720 --> 37:05.260
with a syringe or a banana peel,
I should be just fine.

37:05.260 --> 37:07.680
What do you want?

37:07.680 --> 37:09.890
Well, for starters...

37:09.890 --> 37:12.550
did you kill my brother?

37:14.050 --> 37:15.590
Mycroft Holmes?

37:15.590 --> 37:19.300
There was an open contract
out on him four years ago,

37:19.300 --> 37:21.180
offered by a French
crime syndicate,

37:21.180 --> 37:23.590
but no one collected on it.

37:23.590 --> 37:25.300
He died in a kitchen fire.

37:25.300 --> 37:29.760
My brother died
in New Zealand last July.

37:29.760 --> 37:32.390
They say it was natural causes.

37:32.390 --> 37:34.970
Last July, I was in
a Chinese hospital

37:34.970 --> 37:37.220
recovering from a car crash.

37:37.220 --> 37:38.220
Job gone wrong.

37:38.220 --> 37:40.100
Couldn’t move,
let alone work.

37:40.100 --> 37:44.760
I’ll see if my friends
downstairs can verify that.

37:44.760 --> 37:50.300
In the meantime, who hired you
to kill my father?

37:53.220 --> 37:55.510
I can’t answer that.

37:55.510 --> 37:56.600
Oh, you will answer.

37:56.600 --> 38:02.010
Either to me or to the servants
of the queen.

38:02.010 --> 38:03.430
No. No.

38:03.430 --> 38:06.600
No one’s getting
anything else from me.

38:06.600 --> 38:09.590
I have family, too.

38:12.350 --> 38:15.850
(body thuds, people scream)

38:23.850 --> 38:27.080
Rubens, Brueghel the Younger,
two van Dycks.

38:27.180 --> 38:29.350
They should easily fetch
ten million apiece

38:29.350 --> 38:30.590
from the right buyer.

38:30.590 --> 38:32.220
All I want is five million

38:32.220 --> 38:34.300
wired to my bank
in Luxembourg.

38:34.300 --> 38:36.010
But it has to be today.

38:36.010 --> 38:38.390
You’re not usually
in such a rush.

38:38.390 --> 38:42.050
I apologize, but recent
events have convinced me

38:42.050 --> 38:43.430
it’s time to retire.

38:43.430 --> 38:46.600
Think of this as a
going-out-of-business sale.

38:46.600 --> 38:48.800
So, are you interested?

38:48.800 --> 38:50.430
Yes.

38:52.350 --> 38:53.390
Oh-six. Right.

38:53.390 --> 38:57.470
I need four paintings picked up
at the address I gave you.

38:57.470 --> 38:58.590
No billing on the delivery.

38:58.590 --> 39:01.590
I’ll pay cash. All right.
(car approaching, siren wailing)

39:01.590 --> 39:02.600
As soon as possible.

39:02.600 --> 39:06.590
BELL:
You can cancel
that order.

39:07.430 --> 39:08.680
Unless, of course,
you want to ask

39:08.680 --> 39:11.220
your delivery people to
bring Mr. Wells’s paintings

39:11.220 --> 39:12.590
straight to the
11th Precinct.

39:12.590 --> 39:14.430
What’s this?
What... what’s going on?

39:14.430 --> 39:15.590
What’s going on,
Mr. Venetto,

39:15.590 --> 39:17.590
is you’re about
to be arrested.

39:17.590 --> 39:19.760
For what?
WATSON: We were
listening in on

39:19.760 --> 39:21.300
the conversation
you had with Jasper.

39:21.300 --> 39:23.430
You just agreed
to buy four of his fakes.

39:23.430 --> 39:25.720
There’s no crime in purchasing
a few oil paintings

39:25.720 --> 39:28.590
done in the style
of the old Dutch masters.

39:28.590 --> 39:30.590
Actually, there is--
once you try

39:30.590 --> 39:32.590
to pass them off to collectors

39:32.590 --> 39:33.800
as 300-year-old
masterpieces.

39:33.800 --> 39:35.390
But that’s not
why we’re here.

39:35.390 --> 39:37.100
We’re here because
you solicited

39:37.100 --> 39:38.890
the murder of Mischa Farrell.

39:38.890 --> 39:39.720
Murder?

39:39.720 --> 39:41.850
Hands against
the wall.

39:41.850 --> 39:43.220
Oh...

39:43.590 --> 39:47.010
We got a surveillance
warrant for your phone.

39:47.010 --> 39:51.470
We know you just transferred
$5 million to Mr. Wells

39:51.470 --> 39:54.590
from an offshore account
based in Lebanon.

39:54.590 --> 39:56.970
More importantly, we were able
to match that account to the one

39:56.970 --> 39:59.640
that was used to pay Hausmann
to arrange Mischa’s murder.

39:59.640 --> 40:02.300
I don’t know
what you’re talking about.

40:02.300 --> 40:02.930
Oh, sorry.

40:02.930 --> 40:05.470
You probably know him
better as The Theban.

40:05.470 --> 40:07.590
See, you don’t sell many
Egyptian antiquities,

40:07.590 --> 40:08.590
but you do sell them.

40:08.590 --> 40:11.300
Gotta figure at least a few
were forged by him.

40:11.300 --> 40:13.300
How else would you
have known to ask him

40:13.300 --> 40:14.590
for help with
your Mischa problem?

40:14.590 --> 40:16.600
Of course, that left you
with a Theban problem,

40:16.600 --> 40:18.260
but you solved that one
on your own.

40:18.260 --> 40:20.640
You shot him
while he was walking his dog.

40:20.640 --> 40:21.680
Please, try to understand.

40:21.680 --> 40:23.300
Mischa’s book
would have ruined me.

40:23.300 --> 40:25.640
I’ve sold almost a hundred
of her father’s paintings

40:25.640 --> 40:29.180
over the years-- some of them
to dangerous people.

40:29.180 --> 40:31.260
I never wanted
to hurt her.

40:31.260 --> 40:33.100
You’re just another fraud.

40:33.100 --> 40:35.970
In the end,
Mischa exposed you, too.

40:35.970 --> 40:39.180
Armand Venetto,
you’re under arrest.

40:39.180 --> 40:40.720
You have the right
to remain silent.

40:40.720 --> 40:45.100
Anything you say can be used
against you in the court of law.

40:45.100 --> 40:48.350
MORLAND: You’re certain
that he was planning to kill me?

40:48.350 --> 40:49.850
HOLMES:
As certain as I can be.

40:49.850 --> 40:52.510
Now, I have not
been able to determine

40:52.510 --> 40:53.510
who he was working for.

40:53.510 --> 40:55.590
I don’t know if you
were targeted because of

40:55.590 --> 40:57.590
your day job as
an international consultant

40:57.590 --> 40:59.680
or because of your current
position at the head

40:59.680 --> 41:01.260
of Moriarty’s organization.

41:01.260 --> 41:06.890
But whoever hired him,
they would likely try again.

41:07.430 --> 41:11.300
You should be prepared
for more attempts on your life.

41:12.140 --> 41:14.590
I’m afraid I was expecting this.

41:14.590 --> 41:19.050
There’s a certain
inevitability to it.

41:19.050 --> 41:22.350
One final problem to face.

41:22.350 --> 41:24.510
I didn’t expect
it quite so soon.

41:24.510 --> 41:26.550
You know who hired him?

41:27.220 --> 41:29.590
I understand
that her FBI handlers

41:29.590 --> 41:31.510
lost track of her some time ago.

41:31.510 --> 41:34.640
Of course, they’re reluctant
to discuss details. I...

41:34.640 --> 41:36.140
But I assumed she
was regrouping,

41:36.140 --> 41:39.590
gathering her forces
for the final struggle,

41:39.590 --> 41:44.220
but this would seem to indicate
that I was wrong.

41:44.220 --> 41:47.680
But then I wouldn’t be
the first Holmes man

41:47.680 --> 41:50.010
to underestimate her.

41:53.800 --> 41:56.680
She’s back, son.

41:56.680 --> 41:59.890
And she wants what’s hers.

42:02.640 --> 42:03.930
Moriarty.
