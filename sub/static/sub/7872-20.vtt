WEBVTT

00:20.787 --> 00:22.354
(crow caws)

00:23.823 --> 00:25.290
D'oh!

00:25.292 --> 00:26.458
(tires screeching)

00:26.460 --> 00:28.127
(grunting)

00:28.129 --> 00:30.362
(squeaking)

00:33.133 --> 00:34.533
(belches)

00:41.007 --> 00:42.641
(electrical crackling)

00:42.643 --> 00:44.510
Lewis, my man.

00:44.512 --> 00:46.145
Present table's over there.

00:46.147 --> 00:47.646
(barking)

00:47.648 --> 00:49.648
Make sure you hit
the Squishee station.

00:49.650 --> 00:52.384
They mixed up
a custom flavor just for me!

00:53.653 --> 00:55.888
(kids chattering playfully,
laughing)

00:58.324 --> 01:01.493
These kids' birthday parties
have gotten out of control.

01:01.495 --> 01:03.495
How can a normal
family compete?

01:03.497 --> 01:05.197
They rented chairs.

01:05.199 --> 01:07.499
The kind with puffy seats!

01:07.501 --> 01:09.668
And check out this gift bag.

01:09.670 --> 01:11.336
Full-size candy bars,

01:11.338 --> 01:14.540
hummingbird
in a plastic bag, a CD

01:14.542 --> 01:16.375
of The Gay Men's Chorus
of Springfield

01:16.377 --> 01:18.710
singing
"Happy Birthday, Milhouse."

01:18.712 --> 01:21.847
Dad, I want self-driving
mini-cars at my next birthday!

01:21.849 --> 01:24.349
To the petting zoo!

01:24.351 --> 01:26.518
That would cost
a fortune!

01:26.520 --> 01:29.088
Who do you think I am,
a professional bowler?

01:30.523 --> 01:32.691
It's worth it
to see my son

01:32.693 --> 01:35.561
as spoiled and ungrateful
as the richest brat in town.

01:35.563 --> 01:37.196
Dad,

01:37.198 --> 01:38.864
you were supposed
to cut this cheese

01:38.866 --> 01:40.866
in the shape
of Pokémon characters.

01:40.868 --> 01:43.368
You said you wanted
Disney's Muppets!

01:43.370 --> 01:46.038
That was the meeting
before the last meeting!

01:46.040 --> 01:47.206
(grunts)

01:47.208 --> 01:48.707
(sighs)

01:48.709 --> 01:50.876
This birthday party
arms race is unsustainable.

01:50.878 --> 01:55.080
Unless... the sanest man in town
declared war on these parties

01:55.082 --> 01:57.883
in a last best attempt
to bring things back to normal.

01:57.885 --> 02:00.719
I will secretly destroy
these children's birthdays,

02:00.721 --> 02:02.955
or die trying.

02:14.100 --> 02:15.901
Two of... several animals!

02:15.903 --> 02:18.170
Looks like it's time
to build me an ark.

02:20.440 --> 02:22.074
Rice cakes?!

02:22.076 --> 02:23.575
I pronounce
this party dead.

02:23.577 --> 02:24.943
Nurse, note the time.

02:24.945 --> 02:26.678
(chuckles)

02:28.581 --> 02:29.581
(tires squeak)

02:29.583 --> 02:32.251
(humming, singing)

02:32.253 --> 02:34.253
Time to make 50 bucks.

02:34.255 --> 02:35.754
♪ Yah-dah, dah-dat...

02:35.756 --> 02:37.256
Ooh!

02:37.258 --> 02:38.757
(children shrieking, gasping)

02:38.759 --> 02:40.092
Look at that.

02:40.094 --> 02:41.927
Let's see
what else is in the noose.

02:41.929 --> 02:43.428
(laughing like Krusty)

02:43.430 --> 02:46.932
I was the last kid on Earth
who liked clowns.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.267
(humming)

02:48.269 --> 02:50.269
Homer Simpson,
do you know anything

02:50.271 --> 02:51.937
about these epic
birthday fails?

02:51.939 --> 02:53.972
(high-pitched voice);
Just what I read in the papers.

02:53.974 --> 02:56.775
You did suck the helium
out of all these balloons!

02:56.777 --> 02:59.111
(high-pitched voice):
All right, Marge, maybe
I did cut the strings

02:59.113 --> 03:01.113
on a few party hats,
but when I was a kid,

03:01.115 --> 03:03.448
a birthday party was nothing
more than a supermarket cake

03:03.450 --> 03:05.450
and sticking pins
in a donkey's butt.

03:05.452 --> 03:06.785
(clears throat)

03:06.787 --> 03:08.787
(normal voice):
And we looked forward to it

03:08.789 --> 03:10.789
for one whole year.

03:10.791 --> 03:12.457
And the gift bag was...

03:12.459 --> 03:14.293
You didn't need
a frickin' gift bag,

03:14.295 --> 03:17.296
because you just went
to a frickin' party!

03:17.298 --> 03:18.630
You have a point.

03:18.632 --> 03:20.299
But when the bounce
house renters

03:20.301 --> 03:23.135
and the pony ride operators
find out what you've done...

03:23.137 --> 03:24.836
Mm....

03:24.838 --> 03:28.540
(scoffs) I'm not afraid
of Big Birthday.

03:30.143 --> 03:32.211
(shrieks)
Big Birthday!

03:34.514 --> 03:38.650
You have meddled with the
primal forces of nurture,

03:38.652 --> 03:41.820
Mr. Simpson, and
I won't have it!

03:41.822 --> 03:44.489
Do you think you just
stopped a few lavish parties?

03:44.491 --> 03:45.991
Oh, no, sir.

03:45.993 --> 03:49.861
There is simply one endless
birthday celebration

03:49.863 --> 03:55.334
where everyone gets a gift bag
and no parent gets off easy.

03:55.336 --> 03:57.669
Do you think this country
makes cars anymore?

03:57.671 --> 03:59.671
Do you think we smelt steel?

03:59.673 --> 04:01.673
No. The only thing we do

04:01.675 --> 04:04.343
is throw elaborate
children's cotillions

04:04.345 --> 04:06.211
with enormous inedible cakes

04:06.213 --> 04:09.848
out from whence
Yale graduates pop!

04:09.850 --> 04:12.384
ALL (groaning):
Eh.

04:12.386 --> 04:16.521
Mr. Simpson, the very fabric
of our existence is birthdays!

04:16.523 --> 04:19.024
The quarks and bosons
of your soul?

04:19.026 --> 04:20.859
Birthdays!

04:20.861 --> 04:24.363
You have tried to
unwind the world,

04:24.365 --> 04:27.366
and you...
will... atone!

04:27.368 --> 04:28.367
Sorry.

04:28.369 --> 04:29.868
You <i>will</i> be sorry.

04:29.870 --> 04:32.871
We are officially
blacklisting you, my friend.

04:32.873 --> 04:36.541
Your children will never have
a balloon animal maker

04:36.543 --> 04:39.711
or customized cake again!

04:39.713 --> 04:40.545
(both gasping)

04:40.547 --> 04:41.747
No!
No!

04:41.749 --> 04:43.915
(crying):
No-oh-oh-oh!

04:43.917 --> 04:46.718
I don't want to live.

04:46.720 --> 04:49.221
Not their birthdays!
Take Easter!

04:49.223 --> 04:50.889
Easter's nothing.

04:50.891 --> 04:54.226
Geez, kids, I guess
you've had your last birthday.

04:54.228 --> 04:56.561
You're gonna stay
your current ages

04:56.563 --> 04:58.563
for the rest of your lives.

04:58.565 --> 05:00.232
Please.
I'll do anything.

05:00.234 --> 05:01.733
All right.

05:01.735 --> 05:04.403
The next birthday that comes up
in this town is, uh,

05:04.405 --> 05:06.571
Rod Flanders,

05:06.573 --> 05:09.741
and you have
to throw him a party.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.076
(groans):
Oh.

05:11.078 --> 05:13.412
Um, how bad do you kids
want birthdays?

05:13.414 --> 05:14.746
Dad!

05:14.748 --> 05:17.149
How bad do <i>you</i> want
to sleep in Saturdays?

05:17.151 --> 05:18.617
(banging loudly)

05:18.619 --> 05:20.252
Hey, hey, hey,
I was just kidding around.

05:20.254 --> 05:22.087
You know that. I was just...

05:22.089 --> 05:23.422
You have a deal.

05:23.424 --> 05:24.756
Let me make this clear.

05:24.758 --> 05:27.592
This event has
to be magical.

05:27.594 --> 05:29.127
You mean, hire a magician?

05:29.129 --> 05:30.762
No, no, no. Magical.

05:30.764 --> 05:35.200
Magical events change
people's lives forever.

05:38.271 --> 05:40.505
(plane sputtering)

05:45.111 --> 05:48.447
Welcome to Rod Flanders'
birthday party.

05:48.449 --> 05:52.551
I'm your host Homer Simpson,
and I can't take it anymore!

05:53.453 --> 05:54.986
Stupid golden age of flight!

05:54.988 --> 05:57.789
Mmm. I love you,
mean neighbor!

05:57.791 --> 05:59.791
MAN (over P.A.):
Attention partygoers!

05:59.793 --> 06:03.628
Prepare for the arrival
of our guest of honor... Lulu!

06:03.630 --> 06:07.132
This majestic B-17
has been lovingly restored

06:07.134 --> 06:09.301
by the same
World War Two veterans

06:09.303 --> 06:13.205
who see her every night
in their horrible flashbacks.

06:15.975 --> 06:18.677
Thanks for coming out and...

06:18.679 --> 06:21.880
Abe Simpson?!

06:24.317 --> 06:27.819
That's Mach Ridley,
my old Air Force buddy!

06:27.821 --> 06:29.654
You said
you were in the Army.

06:29.656 --> 06:31.656
You said you
were in the Navy.

06:31.658 --> 06:33.325
That's the kind of mix-up
that used to happen

06:33.327 --> 06:35.160
when I was in the Marines.

06:35.162 --> 06:38.163
So, what brings you boys
to Springfield?

06:38.165 --> 06:40.832
Uh, we just want to make sure
kids have a chance

06:40.834 --> 06:42.667
to meet one of the lovely ladies

06:42.669 --> 06:44.669
that brought freedom
to the world.

06:44.671 --> 06:47.005
Why are planes
and boats always women?

06:47.007 --> 06:49.174
Because they require
a lot of upkeep

06:49.176 --> 06:51.510
and a firm hand
at the controls.

06:51.512 --> 06:53.345
I knew there'd be a sexist joke
behind it.

06:53.347 --> 06:54.513
I knew it!

06:54.515 --> 06:56.515
Abe, can you join us
for a drink?

06:56.517 --> 06:57.883
I'm sorry, guys.

06:57.885 --> 07:00.051
My dad can't handle
that much excitement.

07:00.053 --> 07:02.854
Please, son. I want
to gab about the days

07:02.856 --> 07:05.557
when nurses kissed ya
instead of beating ya.

07:05.559 --> 07:08.693
Now, Dad, memory lane's
not what it used to be.

07:08.695 --> 07:10.529
If you hang out
with your old buddies,

07:10.531 --> 07:14.032
it'll remind you of
when you were a proud stallion

07:14.034 --> 07:16.535
instead of a broken-down nag.

07:16.537 --> 07:18.203
(neighs sadly)

07:18.205 --> 07:19.538
(sputters)

07:19.540 --> 07:21.706
That's the lack of spirit.

07:21.708 --> 07:23.942
(whimpering)

07:25.044 --> 07:27.212
Look at how
he treats his own father.

07:27.214 --> 07:29.381
Like we used to treat P.O.W.s

07:29.383 --> 07:31.383
when the Red Cross
wasn't looking.

07:31.385 --> 07:32.717
(laughter)

07:32.719 --> 07:35.887
Boys, I think we have
one last mission.

07:35.889 --> 07:37.956
(mechanical whirring)

07:39.725 --> 07:42.561
Make a wish, Roddy.

07:42.563 --> 07:44.563
I'll never grow up
and marry Daddy!

07:44.565 --> 07:46.231
(laughter)

07:46.233 --> 07:47.966
(Dutch accent):
Very amusing.

07:50.403 --> 07:51.736
Whoa!

07:51.738 --> 07:53.905
I've seen all I need to see.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.907
But just in case, the face.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.108
MILHOUSE:
Oh!

07:57.110 --> 07:59.411
May I chuckle in Dutch?
(chuckles)

07:59.413 --> 08:02.747
Bart, meet my cousin
from the Netherlands, Annika.

08:02.749 --> 08:04.249
Isn't she gorgeous?

08:04.251 --> 08:06.585
(laughs)

08:06.587 --> 08:08.587
Whoa! You smoke?

08:08.589 --> 08:10.589
It's an e-cigarette.

08:10.591 --> 08:13.124
Care to vape?

08:13.126 --> 08:16.161
Don't you want to be one
of the cool kinderen?

08:16.929 --> 08:19.164
(inhaling)

08:20.433 --> 08:22.434
(coughing)

08:22.436 --> 08:25.437
(coughing, gasping)

08:25.439 --> 08:26.438
(snorts)

08:26.440 --> 08:27.939
Refreshing.

08:27.941 --> 08:30.141
(knocking)

08:30.143 --> 08:32.777
Hey, look at you guys,
still not dead.

08:32.779 --> 08:34.479
Good for you.

08:34.481 --> 08:36.448
Mister, we're gonna pound
your thick skull

08:36.450 --> 08:37.949
till you treat your father

08:37.951 --> 08:40.118
with the kindness
every human being deserves.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.454
(scoffs)
Do your worst, you old goats.

08:42.456 --> 08:46.658
This won't be a tropical
vacation like Iwo Jima.

08:46.660 --> 08:48.960
It's you and me,
Blubber McGee.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.529
Ha!
(muttering)

08:52.131 --> 08:53.798
(muttering)
Oh.

08:53.800 --> 08:56.067
(grunting)
(laughs)

08:57.303 --> 08:59.304
(panting)

08:59.306 --> 09:01.006
(grunts)

09:01.008 --> 09:04.042
You done
girly punching?
Yes.

09:08.180 --> 09:12.317
(laughs) Once again,
I win at Sjoelbak.

09:12.319 --> 09:13.985
Everybody's got one gift.

09:13.987 --> 09:17.422
Mine is portable indoor
Dutch shuffleboard.

09:17.424 --> 09:19.891
(humming)

09:21.327 --> 09:23.328
Bart, I'm out of cartridges.

09:23.330 --> 09:26.197
Be my little almond cookie and
run down to the Kwik-E-Mart.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.499
Hup, hup.

09:27.501 --> 09:28.667
You can kiss me.

09:28.669 --> 09:30.502
(squeaking)

09:30.504 --> 09:32.704
Oh, that felt so good.

09:32.706 --> 09:35.540
Now you know
what nuzzling me would be like.

09:35.542 --> 09:37.342
Now not so good.

09:37.344 --> 09:38.510
(whistling)

09:38.512 --> 09:40.679
Five packs of
e-cigs, Apu.
E-cigs?

09:40.681 --> 09:42.681
Although legal
for children in this state,

09:42.683 --> 09:45.684
you are asking
for a nicotine delivery device

09:45.686 --> 09:47.686
that could quite possibly
leave you breathing

09:47.688 --> 09:49.421
through a hole in your neck.

09:50.189 --> 09:52.857
Eat your spinach, Bart.

09:52.859 --> 09:54.359
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

09:54.361 --> 09:55.694
<i>Ay carumba!</i>

09:55.696 --> 09:58.196
Cool! I was just doing this
for a girl,

09:58.198 --> 10:00.365
but give me two more packs
for myself.

10:00.367 --> 10:04.035
Oh, you have the right, but
remember, this is not kid stuff.

10:04.037 --> 10:05.870
Now, would you like
bubblegum flavor,

10:05.872 --> 10:08.540
strawberry shortcake
or watermelon dream?

10:08.542 --> 10:10.542
Homer, you're late!

10:10.544 --> 10:13.244
In the Air Force, when
we showed up late, people died.

10:13.246 --> 10:15.547
When we showed up on time,
other people died.

10:15.549 --> 10:16.748
The right people.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.416
Homer J. Simpson,

10:18.418 --> 10:22.454
if I wasn't wearing my smiling
teeth, I'd look very angry.

20:26.826 --> 20:28.492
In honor of that
record you broke,

20:28.494 --> 20:31.996
I'm gonna cook you the
thickest steak of your life.

20:31.998 --> 20:33.364
Thank you, son.

20:33.366 --> 20:36.500
But the days when I can
eat a steak are long gone.

20:36.502 --> 20:38.169
I wouldn't be so sure.

20:38.171 --> 20:39.403
(laughs)

20:47.346 --> 20:50.081
No. Still too tough.

20:55.187 --> 20:58.522
Aw, that's the best
steak I ever breathed.

20:58.524 --> 21:00.391
I'm full.
