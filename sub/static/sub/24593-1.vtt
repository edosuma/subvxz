00:29.197 --> 00:30.157
Everything
you're searching for,

00:30.198 --> 00:31.490
you have within you.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.743
And you can create
that inner wealth

00:33.785 --> 00:35.703
that turns into outer
success later on.

00:35.745 --> 00:38.748
That's what feeling rich
is really all about.

00:44.420 --> 00:46.338
It's strange because
when I was a kid,

00:46.380 --> 00:47.798
everybody used to always ask me

00:47.840 --> 00:49.508
if I was gonna get into
music like my father

00:49.550 --> 00:52.012
and it became such a
repetitive question,

00:52.053 --> 00:54.680
that I almost tried
to intentionally

00:54.722 --> 00:57.225
do something different
just for that.

01:08.487 --> 01:11.280
I've worked on numerous successful
multi-platinum projects

01:11.322 --> 01:12.823
throughout my career.

01:12.865 --> 01:14.408
But this is the most
important project

01:14.450 --> 01:15.993
that I've ever
been involved with,

01:16.035 --> 01:18.663
mainly because it has the
potential to transform,

01:18.705 --> 01:21.665
an entire generation
for the better.

01:21.707 --> 01:24.585
Over 60% of kids that group
up in lower-income areas

01:24.627 --> 01:26.670
like South Central, Los Angeles

01:26.712 --> 01:28.590
grow up in a
single-parent household

01:28.632 --> 01:31.300
and because of this rappers
take on an exaggerated influence

01:31.342 --> 01:32.718
in their life.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.345
They become almost
like a father figure

01:34.387 --> 01:36.305
in their own father's absence.

01:36.347 --> 01:37.557
So what would happened
if you applied

01:37.598 --> 01:39.600
this massive
influence to health.

01:39.642 --> 01:42.645
Well, I'm about to tell you
hip-hop's biggest secret.

01:54.365 --> 01:56.910
We are in the midst of
a huge transformation.

01:56.952 --> 01:58.912
We're watching our
entire culture be reborn.

01:58.953 --> 02:01.080
So as we were being reborn
and we look at this nation,

02:01.122 --> 02:03.750
we want to go backwards and
see what made the nation great.

02:03.792 --> 02:06.168
What made the nation
great was always a strong,

02:06.210 --> 02:07.920
agricultural system.

02:07.962 --> 02:11.257
And that technology, that
expertise was then exploited.

02:11.298 --> 02:14.427
That exploitation caused
many of us to back away from

02:14.468 --> 02:17.013
agriculture and we
monetized the food

02:17.055 --> 02:19.348
but we were dealing
with free labor.

02:19.390 --> 02:23.102
The huge inequity
that that started,

02:23.143 --> 02:25.103
it got people very angry.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.273
It got people very
sad, very frustrated

02:27.315 --> 02:30.527
so here comes all the problems
that come from that, right?

02:30.568 --> 02:34.155
So we're moving back to the
circle, spiraling back inward.

02:34.197 --> 02:36.157
And I think it's
important to note that

02:36.198 --> 02:38.702
we're having this
conversation in the midst of

02:38.743 --> 02:40.995
what I believe is
a cultural shift

02:41.037 --> 02:43.540
that is happening
in this country.

02:43.582 --> 02:46.625
A transformation in
how we live and eat.

02:46.667 --> 02:50.797
There's a shift in
consciousness about food,

02:50.838 --> 02:53.633
about taking care of
yourself, exercise.

02:53.675 --> 02:55.302
The fact that more
people are concerned with

02:55.343 --> 02:57.428
what they do or don't eat
in the hip-hop community

02:57.470 --> 03:00.640
means that you'll hear more.

03:09.857 --> 03:12.152
Anybody you like
in pop culture,

03:12.193 --> 03:13.903
if they're not on a health path,

03:13.945 --> 03:17.490
they're somebody in their
ear right now as we speak

03:17.532 --> 03:20.243
telling them, you better
get on a health path,

03:20.285 --> 03:21.827
'cause that's what's poppin'.

03:21.868 --> 03:26.958
Look outside, don't be blind.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.375
And the people
being aware of it.

03:28.417 --> 03:30.378
The more we push it, the
more we can get it out there.

03:30.420 --> 03:31.837
Instead of telling
people, let's show people.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.632
Show people you
work out everyday.

03:33.673 --> 03:35.633
Show people what
you eat everyday.

03:35.675 --> 03:37.968
You show people everything else,
when you on the red carpet,

03:38.010 --> 03:40.095
you show people behind
the scenes and do videos...

03:40.137 --> 03:44.183
show a motherfucker when you're
in the gym for two hours.

03:44.225 --> 03:47.520
Hip-hop is truly a reflection
of the community usually.

03:47.562 --> 03:50.315
It's a reflection of what's
going on in the inner cities

03:50.357 --> 03:53.150
of America and now
suburban America also.

03:53.192 --> 03:56.237
I think as artists, we could
take the responsibility to say,

03:56.278 --> 03:58.238
this is my lifestyle
and people start

03:58.280 --> 03:59.615
gravitating towards it.

03:59.657 --> 04:01.658
This artist is into
healthy lifestyle,

04:01.700 --> 04:04.037
this artist actually
is into yoga.

04:04.078 --> 04:07.248
And this artist, you know,
actually is a vegetarian.

04:07.290 --> 04:08.792
You know, when you find those
things out, you're like,

04:08.833 --> 04:11.710
man that person fly,
and they do that?

04:11.752 --> 04:13.755
I'm with it.

04:19.927 --> 04:22.680
You had this big Southern
migration that took place,

04:22.722 --> 04:24.140
like in the twenties,
African-Americans

04:24.182 --> 04:26.892
were moving out of the South,
fleeing the Ku Klux Klan,

04:26.933 --> 04:28.393
they came to urban areas.

04:28.435 --> 04:29.895
They no longer wanted to farm.

04:29.937 --> 04:32.315
They wanted urban jobs,
so it created a system.

04:32.357 --> 04:34.483
But not only did we
dismiss agriculture,

04:34.525 --> 04:36.735
it created a system where
we were no longer eating

04:36.777 --> 04:39.905
the way we had been eating as
sharecroppers and as farmers.

04:39.947 --> 04:42.117
We were no longer sitting
at the table together.

04:42.158 --> 04:44.743
And so that Southern
migration brought us forward,

04:44.785 --> 04:46.120
but it also took us back.

04:46.162 --> 04:48.580
You go to any hood,
you know what you got.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.290
You got the liquor store,
you got the, you know...

04:50.333 --> 04:51.583
- Chicken store
- McDonald's.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.002
Chicken store.
- Yeah. fried chicken store.

04:53.043 --> 04:54.587
Basically, the
concept of food desserts

04:54.628 --> 04:57.673
is when you don't have
access to fresh produce

04:57.715 --> 04:59.467
within like a one to
seven mile radius.

04:59.508 --> 05:02.345
And there's a lot of
neighborhoods all across America

05:02.387 --> 05:03.595
where people don't have that.

05:03.637 --> 05:04.930
It would be almost
impossible for them

05:04.972 --> 05:07.558
to get their hands
on fresh produce.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.768
That adds anther
layer of difficulty

05:09.810 --> 05:11.562
in trying to stay healthy
when all you see around you

05:11.603 --> 05:17.068
is beer and cigarettes
and chips and fast food.

05:17.110 --> 05:18.695
Growing up in Brooklyn,
the type of foods

05:18.737 --> 05:21.322
that I ate was a
lot of fried foods.

05:21.363 --> 05:23.742
A lot of fried
chicken, fried fish.

05:23.783 --> 05:27.620
Pork chop, a fried
platano maduros or tostones

05:27.662 --> 05:30.540
or fried chicken or fried steak.

05:30.582 --> 05:33.458
McDonald's, Jack in the
Box, cookies and milk,

05:33.500 --> 05:35.462
like I would eat that
for dinner sometimes.

05:35.503 --> 05:37.505
Mac and cheese,
a lot of pasta,

05:37.547 --> 05:39.673
fried chicken, potato
chips, cookies.

05:39.715 --> 05:42.968
Wings or you know a
egg roll or some chips,

05:43.010 --> 05:44.262
whatever's on the boulevard.

05:44.303 --> 05:46.888
A lot of African-Americans
believe that

05:46.930 --> 05:49.058
they eat bad and
that's their thing.

05:49.100 --> 05:53.062
We are used to eating
well-seasoned foods,

05:53.103 --> 05:54.938
foods that taste good.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.898
Back in the slavery
days, you know,

05:56.940 --> 05:58.483
they had to make
dishes out of food

05:58.525 --> 06:02.028
that the general population
didn't wanna eat.

06:02.072 --> 06:04.365
The tops of turnips, you
know the turnip greens,

06:04.407 --> 06:06.242
and the tops of mustard.

06:06.283 --> 06:09.328
They learned how to
make the best out of

06:09.370 --> 06:13.373
all of the imperfect conditions.

06:13.415 --> 06:14.875
- It goes back to slavery days.

06:14.917 --> 06:16.710
When they would be out in
the fields picking corn,

06:16.752 --> 06:18.212
that's what they
would get to eat.

06:18.253 --> 06:19.588
The scraps and stuff and
make cornbread out of it.

06:19.630 --> 06:21.257
So now it's just a part
of Southern culture.

06:21.298 --> 06:23.508
I used to eat
chitlins and pig feet.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.010
I didn't know what
they were, I was a kid.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.553
And it was good, you know
you just eat and just...

06:26.595 --> 06:28.013
you don't know any better,
it's what you brought up on

06:28.055 --> 06:29.640
and then one day I walk
in my mom's kitchen

06:29.682 --> 06:31.725
and she's cleaning
chitlins and I'm like,

06:31.767 --> 06:33.685
what is that smell and she's
like, these are the chitlins.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.480
And I'm like, what is that,
explain to me what this is.

06:35.522 --> 06:37.190
And she's, well the
pig's intestines.

06:37.232 --> 06:38.690
You never told me that before.

06:38.732 --> 06:39.817
In the South no
one thinks that

06:39.858 --> 06:41.360
you're supposed to be a vegan,

06:41.402 --> 06:44.072
you're supposed to eat
fried chicken and fried food

06:44.113 --> 06:47.158
and pork and all of that,
that's what we grew up on.

06:47.200 --> 06:48.658
Growing up in
Texas it's kinda hard

06:48.700 --> 06:50.578
when everybody in the whole
state is trying to get you

06:50.620 --> 06:52.413
to be bigger, you know.

06:52.455 --> 06:54.373
Oh you big, oh you gonna
be a big football player.

06:54.415 --> 06:55.415
That's what they
tell you, you know?

06:55.458 --> 06:57.543
They don't say, damn man,

06:57.585 --> 06:59.337
you a little big to
be 11, 12 years old.

06:59.378 --> 07:01.047
They say, aw, you gonna
be a big football player.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.632
They encourage you to be bigger.

07:02.673 --> 07:06.218
The food was always a
big deal for our family.

07:06.260 --> 07:08.262
If you cry, your grandma
offered you something to eat.

07:08.303 --> 07:09.597
You want some pie,
you want some cake?

07:09.638 --> 07:11.390
Food has always
been an important part

07:11.432 --> 07:13.058
of the African-American culture.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.560
You know my
grandmother always said

07:14.602 --> 07:16.395
that if we can do
anything for people,

07:16.437 --> 07:18.397
we could give them
something to eat.

07:18.438 --> 07:21.900
They feel like they showing
somebody love by feeding them.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.320
So especially if
you a chubby kid,

07:24.362 --> 07:26.738
everybody wanna get on your
good side of the family

07:26.780 --> 07:29.075
and every house you go to
they giving you more treats

07:29.117 --> 07:30.408
and more treats and more treats.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.952
Hey I got a little
ice cream for you.

07:31.993 --> 07:34.580
My mom was diabetic, so
I shoulda known better.

07:34.622 --> 07:37.417
But for whatever reason
I had the sweetest tooth

07:37.458 --> 07:38.750
known to mankind.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.210
- We was filled with carbs.

07:40.252 --> 07:44.923
We'd have four cans of
Planters red-skinned peanuts

07:44.965 --> 07:47.635
and four giant bars
of Mr. Goodbars.

07:47.677 --> 07:50.303
And then we'd send
out for number four

07:50.345 --> 07:52.598
of Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.

07:52.640 --> 07:55.142
Being in this
industry is not really

07:55.183 --> 07:56.602
being health-conscious.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.562
You know when you're
traveling from city to city,

07:58.603 --> 08:00.063
three o'clock in the
morning is the time when

08:00.105 --> 08:02.065
you can get a meal,
like the Waffle House

08:02.107 --> 08:04.193
becomes like the mainstay.

08:04.235 --> 08:05.737
And the IHOP becomes a mainstay.

08:05.778 --> 08:07.488
My studio is next
door to a 7-Eleven,

08:07.530 --> 08:09.365
so when it gets 3:00,
4:00 in the morning,

08:09.407 --> 08:11.283
you were going over
there to get the Funyuns,

08:11.325 --> 08:13.077
and you know Welch's grape soda

08:13.118 --> 08:13.995
and then we coming
back over there

08:14.037 --> 08:15.245
and smoking and all of that.

08:15.287 --> 08:17.080
You eating before
you go the show.

08:17.122 --> 08:19.208
You might eat at the show,
'cause now you're hungry,

08:19.250 --> 08:21.793
you built up a appetite
from running on stage.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.212
Then from there, you're smoking.

08:23.253 --> 08:24.297
Then from when you're smoking,

08:24.338 --> 08:25.548
you're going to the after party.

08:25.590 --> 08:27.633
Drinking like five
bottles of Rosé.

08:27.675 --> 08:28.968
You may not realize
it at that time

08:29.010 --> 08:30.637
'cause you young and
you moving around

08:30.678 --> 08:32.222
and you working your body still.

08:32.263 --> 08:35.140
But as you get older,
you sit still more.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.933
All that stuff
starting to take effect

08:36.975 --> 08:38.768
when you really sit down
and you look at yourself,

08:38.809 --> 08:41.480
well damn, did get
a little stomach.

08:41.522 --> 08:43.982
You don't see it yourself until
somebody start telling you.

08:44.025 --> 08:46.235
Before you were Lil Cease,
three years later people going,

08:46.277 --> 08:47.987
yo, what up fat boy?

08:48.028 --> 08:49.988
It's interesting because
rap is such a genre

08:50.030 --> 08:53.158
where it feeds off
of eating good.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.660
That's what it talks about,

08:54.702 --> 08:57.997
like when you get to making
money, it's like, I'm eating.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.123
That's like a slogan in rap.

09:00.165 --> 09:03.168
And if you eating,
you getting fat.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.670
That's one of the statements
that you hear people say,

09:04.712 --> 09:06.838
you guys got fat
when I was gone.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.715
You know what I mean,
that's like the mafia thing.

09:08.757 --> 09:12.093
I actually took a lot of
pride in being a fat guy

09:12.135 --> 09:15.890
and I embraced the image
and the Fat Joe name.

09:15.932 --> 09:17.350
You know we got
this thing of like,

09:17.392 --> 09:19.018
as more successful as we are,

09:19.060 --> 09:22.062
we think we're better
because we can eat more.

09:22.103 --> 09:23.855
We was like the fat society.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.608
- When Paul and I first met,

09:25.650 --> 09:29.028
he would eat any
and every thing.

09:29.070 --> 09:30.988
My highest weight
was 320 pounds.

09:31.030 --> 09:33.657
That's when I was just too
embarrassed to get on the scale,

09:33.698 --> 09:36.577
after that I was, man I ain't
getting on the scale no more.

09:36.618 --> 09:38.120
This where I'm 320.

09:38.162 --> 09:39.663
You know it's embarrassing
when you ride on the plane

09:39.705 --> 09:42.583
and you gotta ask for
the seatbelt extender.

09:42.625 --> 09:44.668
Don't nobody wanna do
that, that's not playa,

09:44.710 --> 09:45.920
you know what I'm saying?

09:45.962 --> 09:46.878
That's not playa at
all if you gotta ask

09:46.920 --> 09:48.005
for the seatbelt extender.

09:48.047 --> 09:49.423
And I would just think, man,

09:49.465 --> 09:52.343
if I died just from being
fat and falling out.

09:52.385 --> 09:54.678
I didn't think
we'd live past 35.

09:54.720 --> 09:55.595
I really didn't.

09:55.638 --> 09:56.847
Charlie Parker died at 35,

09:56.888 --> 09:58.890
our idols didn't
make it you know.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.142
One of the saddest
days of my life

10:00.183 --> 10:01.643
was when he passed away.

10:01.685 --> 10:02.895
He caught a heart attack.

10:02.937 --> 10:05.773
He died too young, he
was beyond talented.

10:05.815 --> 10:08.567
Like one of the
greatest rappers ever

10:08.608 --> 10:11.903
and besides that I lost a
best friend and a brother.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.407
He was always big.

10:14.448 --> 10:17.117
And uh, Pun liked to eat.

10:17.158 --> 10:18.910
You know and he eat
all the wrong things

10:18.952 --> 10:24.417
Kentucky Friend Chicken,
lot of Chinese food.

10:24.458 --> 10:25.710
Big Pun was one of the
biggest rappers in the game

10:25.752 --> 10:31.173
but he couldn't really
move around like that.

10:31.215 --> 10:33.008
He was just so big where if
we walked through the hotel,

10:33.050 --> 10:35.845
he would run out of breath
before we get to his room.

10:35.887 --> 10:39.515
If we did a show, we would
make sure we did all the words

10:39.557 --> 10:41.100
to make sure he could breathe.

10:41.142 --> 10:46.480
It was just sad man, his
health was deteriorating.

10:46.522 --> 10:48.107
And we tried man and he
just gained that weight

10:48.148 --> 10:50.525
and before you knew
it, he passed away.

10:50.567 --> 10:53.445
I shoulda learned then, but
you know I was still young,

10:53.487 --> 10:54.988
I was still wildin'.

10:55.030 --> 10:56.573
I still was thinking, you
know, it is what it is.

10:56.615 --> 11:01.912
You know I got depressed for
two years and I didn't care.

11:01.953 --> 11:03.580
I started eating
a lot and drinking

11:03.622 --> 11:08.127
and just, and then
I just got so big.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.920
It wasn't 'til recently that

11:09.962 --> 11:12.715
I lost a bunch of my
friends to being overweight.

11:12.757 --> 11:14.758
They caught heart
attacks, all of them.

11:14.800 --> 11:18.262
And just last year alone I
lost like six, seven friends.

11:18.303 --> 11:21.640
Young guys, 34,
32, all overweight.

11:21.682 --> 11:24.602
You know, and these was all
good guys, and funny guys,

11:24.643 --> 11:27.103
and make you laugh and the
coolest and you never thought

11:27.145 --> 11:32.192
they would die and they
were all too young.

11:49.377 --> 11:50.878
First time I heard
that Heavy D passed,

11:50.920 --> 11:53.505
it was just a shock to us,
it still kinda shocking us.

11:53.547 --> 11:54.673
Just trying to come
to grips with it.

11:54.715 --> 11:55.883
- It's too soon.

11:55.925 --> 11:58.593
He's too young and
doesn't make sense.

11:58.635 --> 11:59.928
It doesn't matter
what age you are,

11:59.970 --> 12:02.305
you're supposed to
check yourself out,

12:02.347 --> 12:04.433
you gotta maintain yourself.

12:04.475 --> 12:06.518
It's the most important thing
to take care of your health

12:06.560 --> 12:10.688
early on because you
get up there in age

12:10.730 --> 12:12.650
and you got all these problems,

12:12.692 --> 12:14.152
and at a certain
point it's too late.

12:14.193 --> 12:17.278
The age of people
passing away is getting

12:17.320 --> 12:18.738
younger and younger.

12:18.780 --> 12:24.077
We cannot assume if we're
young that tomorrow's promised.

12:24.120 --> 12:26.538
So it's a day to really
reflect on a great young man.

12:26.580 --> 12:29.875
He was inspirational, he was
a friend, he was a brother.

12:29.917 --> 12:31.460
He's a genuine dude,
he's gonna be well-missed

12:31.502 --> 12:32.753
but he's gonna be remembered.

12:32.795 --> 12:34.505
It was an extension
of who he is.

12:34.547 --> 12:38.342
It was love and lot
of joy, lot of tears,

12:38.383 --> 12:39.593
but tears filled with joy.

12:39.635 --> 12:41.970
That's why I love
Heavy D because Heavy D,

12:42.012 --> 12:44.807
he put love and family
first and foremost.

12:44.848 --> 12:46.892
Heavy did it and he
did it like a king.

12:46.933 --> 12:49.102
You know he felt it
was very important

12:49.145 --> 12:51.563
to give a positive
message in his music

12:51.605 --> 12:53.315
and he always stuck to that.

12:53.357 --> 12:54.608
His love still lives
on through all of us

12:54.650 --> 12:56.693
that were touched,
influenced by him.

12:56.735 --> 13:00.030
I think those who were influenced by him,
carry the love.

13:00.072 --> 13:01.573
It allows him to
live on forever.

13:01.615 --> 13:03.450
We would talk about
something called the barbecue

13:03.492 --> 13:05.160
and what the barbecue
represented was coming

13:05.202 --> 13:06.453
to a place in life
where we didn't have to

13:06.495 --> 13:12.250
worry about bills and
health and all of that.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.378
He got to the barbecue
sooner than I did.

13:14.420 --> 13:15.503
But that's where
he's at right now,

13:15.545 --> 13:16.880
so he's gonna be missed...

13:16.922 --> 13:19.048
uh, sorely missed.

13:19.090 --> 13:21.427
- Hip-Hop loses Heavy.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.595
You see this?

13:23.637 --> 13:25.055
Yo that's the
craziest thing man,

13:25.097 --> 13:27.473
Heavy D inspired me, I mean,

13:27.517 --> 13:28.850
to the highest levels.

13:28.892 --> 13:32.563
He was a big guy like
me, he liked the girls,

13:32.605 --> 13:34.190
he liked being fly.

13:34.232 --> 13:37.442
We never seen a big guy
dressed fly like that before,

13:37.483 --> 13:39.278
dance and have fun like that.

13:39.320 --> 13:42.363
Just a classy guy, a stand
up guy, a beautiful person

13:42.405 --> 13:46.285
and it's really,
really, really sad.

13:51.290 --> 13:53.125
This childhood obesity
epidemic right now

13:53.167 --> 13:55.878
cost our nation about 15
billion dollars a year.

13:55.920 --> 13:59.632
The adult obesity in
America costs upwards of

13:59.673 --> 14:01.633
150 billion dollars a year.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.010
You know when I talk
to pediatricians

14:03.052 --> 14:04.887
who were trained in the
sixties and seventies,

14:04.928 --> 14:06.722
they tell me that
they never learned

14:06.763 --> 14:09.558
how to deal with diabetes,
because they didn't have to.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.227
Children didn't have diabetes.

14:11.268 --> 14:13.228
At the time, type II
diabetes was called.

14:13.270 --> 14:15.647
adult late-onset diabetes.

14:15.688 --> 14:18.358
And your grandmothers or
your elders would all go

14:18.400 --> 14:20.443
to a doctor at some point
in their life and find out,

14:20.485 --> 14:22.195
oh, you have diabetes.

14:22.237 --> 14:24.030
Well now we have
children presenting with

14:24.072 --> 14:26.575
adult diseases at
this point in time.

14:26.617 --> 14:28.452
If a child is
overweight or obese,

14:28.493 --> 14:31.872
they are 30-40% more
likely to have diabetes

14:31.913 --> 14:34.708
in their lifetime, have
hypertension in their lifetime,

14:34.750 --> 14:36.168
have a stroke in their lifetime,

14:36.210 --> 14:38.337
have heart disease
within their lifetime.

14:38.378 --> 14:41.882
As Surgeon General
I have the challenge

14:41.923 --> 14:44.217
of being America's doctor.

14:44.260 --> 14:46.262
One of the areas that we
noticed where there were

14:46.303 --> 14:49.807
disparities is in
minority populations.

14:49.848 --> 14:52.852
African-Americans and
Hispanics, Native Americans,

14:52.893 --> 14:55.853
things like obesity
and childhood obesity,

14:55.895 --> 14:58.607
diabetes and
hypertension and strokes.

14:58.648 --> 15:00.067
These populations
are the fastest growing

15:00.108 --> 15:01.777
populations in the country.

15:01.818 --> 15:04.280
So the fastest growing
populations in the country

15:04.322 --> 15:07.532
are living sicker and have
the potential of dying younger

15:07.573 --> 15:09.535
than other populations
in our country.

15:09.577 --> 15:11.370
If you are an
African-American,

15:11.412 --> 15:14.873
you're nearly twice as
likely to suffer a stroke

15:14.915 --> 15:17.167
than your Caucasian
counterparts.

15:17.208 --> 15:20.045
In this country, there are
75 million children, okay?

15:20.087 --> 15:22.882
23 million of them are
overweight or obese

15:22.923 --> 15:24.132
at this point in time.

15:24.173 --> 15:26.177
That's one-third
across the board.

15:26.218 --> 15:28.970
If they're African-American,
born after the year 2000,

15:29.012 --> 15:30.347
two out of three.

15:30.388 --> 15:32.557
If they're Latino,
2 out of three.

15:32.598 --> 15:34.602
- But if these trends continue,

15:34.643 --> 15:37.478
this could be the first
generation of children,

15:37.520 --> 15:40.607
not to live as long
as their parents.

15:46.613 --> 15:49.742
The nature of spiritual
evolution is very simple.

15:49.783 --> 15:51.660
It's like being on a train,

15:51.702 --> 15:53.703
and you're riding uptown

15:53.745 --> 15:56.082
and you know the place
you're going is downtown.

15:56.123 --> 15:58.458
You have to get off the
train, go to the other side

15:58.500 --> 16:00.377
and go the other way.

16:00.418 --> 16:02.713
And that's an
individual's choice,

16:02.755 --> 16:04.673
because everybody on the
train is riding the wrong way.

16:04.715 --> 16:06.050
You gotta get the
fuck off the train

16:06.092 --> 16:07.258
and go the other way.

16:07.300 --> 16:08.927
And then make choices
from the inside out

16:08.968 --> 16:10.178
rather than the outside in.

16:10.220 --> 16:11.888
We don't have to
have to be sheep.

16:11.930 --> 16:13.223
We don't have to be
any of these things,

16:13.265 --> 16:15.808
but each individual has
to make that choice.

16:15.850 --> 16:17.268
If you don't make that
choice on your own,

16:17.310 --> 16:18.603
it's never gonna work.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.438
Because they'll make
a choice for you.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.858
I'm gonna eat this nasty-ass,
fat, uncomfortable shit,

16:23.900 --> 16:25.110
and you eat it, and
you get the little high

16:25.152 --> 16:26.612
but then what do you do?

16:26.653 --> 16:28.655
Eventually you feel sick
and fat and weighted down.

16:28.697 --> 16:30.448
You go out, you sniff
coke and you drink

16:30.490 --> 16:31.450
and you think you're having fun

16:31.492 --> 16:32.868
and you wake up in the morning

16:32.910 --> 16:35.078
with an extreme fucking headache
and then most of the day

16:35.120 --> 16:36.288
you're trying to
clean up your head

16:36.330 --> 16:39.248
and then you go back
and do the same shit.

16:39.290 --> 16:41.877
Paul Wall, he was
losing it at one point,

16:41.918 --> 16:43.087
I ain't gonna lie.

16:43.128 --> 16:44.505
Paul was looking big.

16:44.547 --> 16:46.382
I used to always tease
Paul, every time I seen him,

16:46.423 --> 16:49.133
I was just like, wow,
you're getting fat,

16:49.175 --> 16:50.635
you about to be out of there.

16:50.677 --> 16:53.138
I started noticing the
promethazine at the studio

16:53.180 --> 16:55.473
all the time, sipping drank,

16:55.515 --> 16:57.142
they're mixing it
different ways.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.645
That was like the drug
of choice at the studio.

16:59.687 --> 17:02.397
The more he sipped, the more
he drank, the bigger he got.

17:02.438 --> 17:05.108
The syrup just tears
your metabolism up,

17:05.150 --> 17:08.069
'cause it slows your heart
rate down, slows your body down

17:08.112 --> 17:12.031
and it puts you to sleep,
and has you feeling groggy.

17:12.073 --> 17:14.660
You know after 10 plus
years of dranking it,

17:14.702 --> 17:16.162
I'm pretty slow.

17:16.203 --> 17:17.997
Paul Wall, that's
all he used to drink.

17:18.038 --> 17:19.748
When I made the song "Grillz,"

17:19.790 --> 17:23.542
he was the person who gave
me my first taste of lean.

17:23.585 --> 17:26.797
He explained to
me, what that syrup

17:26.838 --> 17:29.508
and that soda could do to me.

17:29.550 --> 17:30.967
He was like, JD if you
notice all the dudes

17:31.008 --> 17:34.178
that's leaning and drinking
this, they all big.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.223
And he wasn't trying
to get that big,

17:36.265 --> 17:37.933
but if you stay on that pace,

17:37.975 --> 17:39.392
you definitely gonna get there.

17:39.435 --> 17:41.395
You'll see people out here,
who sipping on that syrup

17:41.437 --> 17:44.690
just blow up real fast
man and get real fat fast.

17:44.732 --> 17:46.192
It ain't just the drug itself,

17:46.233 --> 17:49.027
you know it's a lot go with it.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.155
You know, taking that drug
make you not wanna go work out

17:51.197 --> 17:53.573
or eat healthy or
you just be chilling

17:53.615 --> 17:56.202
and it just get bad man,
everything get slow.

17:56.243 --> 17:58.037
- You feel irritable.

17:58.078 --> 17:59.622
I don't wanna be
fussing at my kids.

17:59.663 --> 18:00.788
But I'm fussing at my kids

18:00.830 --> 18:02.082
'cause I ain't
slept in two weeks.

18:02.123 --> 18:04.042
I don't wanna be
bothered by being a dad,

18:04.083 --> 18:05.418
I wanna lean right now.

18:05.460 --> 18:07.753
This is the cycle, the
same negative behavior.

18:07.797 --> 18:11.883
But one night you forget to
get high or you fall asleep

18:11.925 --> 18:14.093
and then you wake up the
next morning refreshed

18:14.135 --> 18:16.888
and you find out, that
morning meditation is better

18:16.930 --> 18:18.890
than late night drinking.

18:18.932 --> 18:20.517
But then you have
to be committed to

18:20.558 --> 18:24.103
remember to remember
what this gives you.

18:24.145 --> 18:25.897
And then you have to
make it your habit

18:25.938 --> 18:28.233
and that takes
personal strength.

18:28.275 --> 18:31.110
Went to my man's funeral,
and I seen his daughter,

18:31.153 --> 18:32.653
his daughter was
like four years old,

18:32.695 --> 18:35.115
same age as my daughter and I
looked at her and I was like,

18:35.157 --> 18:36.908
yo I don't wanna do that.

18:36.950 --> 18:38.910
I don't wanna leave
my daughter like that.

18:38.952 --> 18:41.705
The obligations,
responsibilities as a man,

18:41.747 --> 18:45.792
make you realize, I need to put
my kids before my pleasures.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.293
That's where I found
a lot of motivation

18:47.335 --> 18:49.128
and the wanting to
get my life together.

18:49.170 --> 18:52.215
Wanna be a man and be a
father to my kids instead of

18:52.257 --> 18:54.467
just living life
for my own pleasure.

18:54.510 --> 18:56.553
Now I wanted to
live for my kids.

18:56.595 --> 18:58.180
I would love him
regardless to how big he got,

18:58.222 --> 19:00.807
it was just really
unhealthy and I worried

19:00.848 --> 19:03.268
about how long he would be
around and I didn't like

19:03.310 --> 19:05.228
how unhappy he was with himself.

19:05.270 --> 19:06.813
To me, he seemed depressed.

19:06.855 --> 19:08.273
The results you
wanna see in your life,

19:08.315 --> 19:11.108
the successes you wanna see,
whether it's through your work,

19:11.150 --> 19:12.652
whether it's in
your relationships.

19:12.693 --> 19:13.945
It starts with like who you are

19:13.987 --> 19:15.572
and how you feel about yourself.

19:15.613 --> 19:18.950
I had surgery in New
Year's Eve of 2010,

19:18.992 --> 19:21.118
and I had did everything I
could do up to that point

19:21.160 --> 19:23.455
to try to lose weight
and I felt like this was

19:23.497 --> 19:25.582
my last resort,
having the surgery.

19:25.623 --> 19:28.877
'Cause I wasn't just overweight,
I was morbidly obese.

19:28.918 --> 19:31.297
And the doctor told me that if
you're 50 pounds overweight,

19:31.338 --> 19:33.465
it takes 15 years off your life.

19:33.507 --> 19:36.468
That's real time, 15
years is a long time.

19:36.510 --> 19:39.680
So I said man, this is an
investment for my life,

19:39.722 --> 19:41.932
for my family, it's something
I really need to do.

19:41.973 --> 19:44.517
I can either wait 'til it gets
too bad and I have no choice

19:44.560 --> 19:46.853
or I can get on it now
so that I will be here

19:46.895 --> 19:49.188
'til I'm 70, 80, 90 years old.

19:49.230 --> 19:50.940
We were very
supportive of him,

19:50.982 --> 19:53.527
because we were all
worried about him.

19:53.568 --> 19:55.320
You know we love him,
we want him to be around

19:55.362 --> 19:56.988
forever and ever and ever.

19:57.030 --> 20:00.700
We have children, like you
know, that's my soul mate.

20:00.742 --> 20:02.452
When I went in
to get my surgery,

20:02.493 --> 20:03.870
I didn't want to do
something that was

20:03.912 --> 20:08.583
only gonna have me right
for, you know a couple years.

20:08.625 --> 20:10.043
It's the lifestyle changes.

20:10.085 --> 20:13.255
Not just, well he got surgery,
you know what I'm saying?

20:13.297 --> 20:15.007
Yeah I had surgery
but I also, I train...

20:15.048 --> 20:17.425
I go hard in the
gym, I eat right.

20:17.467 --> 20:19.260
It's a lifestyle change.

20:19.302 --> 20:20.553
Where
we headed to now?

20:20.595 --> 20:22.097
- Eaton Canyon man.

20:22.138 --> 20:24.975
It's like my new,
it's my new trail.

20:25.017 --> 20:27.810
I did four months at Runyon.

20:27.852 --> 20:31.188
Kinda took it over, so I
figured I'd change it up

20:31.230 --> 20:35.110
on starting my third
60 day challenge

20:35.152 --> 20:37.403
which is pretty much
gonna be my entire core.

20:37.445 --> 20:39.238
Once you complete
the first 60 days,

20:39.280 --> 20:41.867
then the next 60 days
is to rebuild the body.

20:41.908 --> 20:44.787
And then the next 60
days is just maintenance.

20:44.828 --> 20:46.413
So do through the
hikes and the training,

20:46.455 --> 20:47.872
and our diet and meal plans,

20:47.913 --> 20:50.375
we're able to create a stable
environment for people.

20:50.417 --> 20:52.252
Game's awesome, he's
inspiring a lot of people

20:52.293 --> 20:53.878
to stay on their
fitness and workout.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.672
When you have other people
that wanna motivate you,

20:55.713 --> 20:58.175
it makes things a lot easier,
it makes working out fun.

20:58.217 --> 21:00.218
Once you start and you
get on this fitness grind

21:00.260 --> 21:02.053
like this, it goes forever.

21:02.095 --> 21:04.640
Like I'm gonna have to
eat healthy and workout

21:04.682 --> 21:06.140
for the rest of my life.

21:06.182 --> 21:08.977
So if you're not dedicated to
yourself, don't even start,

21:09.018 --> 21:10.228
because you're
wasting your time.

21:10.270 --> 21:12.230
You can't ask your
body questions.

21:12.272 --> 21:14.232
Like you do something
that you're afraid of

21:14.273 --> 21:16.150
and you ask yourself,
are you ready to do this?

21:16.192 --> 21:17.568
Well you've already killed

21:17.610 --> 21:19.570
half of the
determination in yourself

21:19.612 --> 21:22.073
because you're giving
yourself an option to say no.

21:22.115 --> 21:24.075
What I do with myself is I
was wake up in the morning

21:24.117 --> 21:26.912
and I say, you
know, let's get it.

21:26.953 --> 21:30.082
I'm getting diesel
right now.

21:30.123 --> 21:33.710
I got the eye of the tiger,
you know what I'm saying?

21:33.752 --> 21:34.753
Quick start.

21:34.795 --> 21:37.380
Three, two, one, let's go.

23:08.138 --> 23:11.850
Just did like five
mile run, stop, hike,

23:11.892 --> 23:13.352
waterfall thing man.

23:13.393 --> 23:15.187
And you know what, you would
thing that after all of that,

23:15.228 --> 23:17.938
that you would feel exhausted,
but you know how I feel?

23:17.980 --> 23:19.023
I feel rich.

23:19.065 --> 23:22.735
That's it.

23:22.777 --> 23:25.863
I decided to create the
MixFitz Turn-Up because

23:25.905 --> 23:28.533
in my Zumba classes the
ladies were having a blast.

23:28.575 --> 23:29.367
- Here we go!

23:29.408 --> 23:31.035
Step.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.703
Back.

23:37.417 --> 23:38.835
- Class was great.

23:38.877 --> 23:41.463
We had a blast, it was so much
fun, I had a good workout.

23:41.505 --> 23:43.882
Oh my God, it was
a workout for real.

23:44.757 --> 23:45.925
- Had a great time!

23:45.967 --> 23:47.218
Even the white girl
learned how to dance.

23:47.260 --> 23:49.805
It's a lot of energy
and we have a blast.

23:49.847 --> 23:53.475
However, there was
something missing,

23:53.517 --> 23:58.313
I wanted to keep it
authentic to Houston flavor.

23:58.355 --> 24:00.065
To that Southern flavor.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.735
So the ladies wanted
to get ratchet.

24:04.777 --> 24:06.403
So we decided that we
were gonna start something

24:06.445 --> 24:11.033
where we could have
good, clean, ratchet fun.

24:18.417 --> 24:21.628
You know, it's a big woman
gang, everybody's Beyoncé.

24:21.670 --> 24:23.713
Everybody's on stage
when you're there,

24:23.755 --> 24:25.882
you're on stage,
you're having fun.

24:25.923 --> 24:29.552
And so, I mean, it's like
having a big old crew.

24:32.680 --> 24:36.100
I absolutely feel like
we are at the beginning

24:36.142 --> 24:39.562
of a self-love revolution.

24:39.603 --> 24:40.772
Like for real.

24:40.813 --> 24:43.483
Anytime you step
outside of yourself

24:43.525 --> 24:49.072
and achieve something that
you never thought possible,

24:49.113 --> 24:50.823
I think you start looking
at yourself different.

24:50.865 --> 24:52.658
Like, goddam, you a champ.

24:52.700 --> 24:55.453
Holistic health is not
just focusing on exercise

24:55.495 --> 24:58.163
or what you eat or
meditating and doing yoga,

24:58.207 --> 25:00.458
it's all three, so it's
mind, body and spirit.

25:07.507 --> 25:10.677
So I feel like the one
person that truly embodies

25:10.718 --> 25:14.138
holistic health like
who's really the prototype

25:14.180 --> 25:16.057
is Stic.Man from Dead Prez.

25:16.098 --> 25:18.058
And he's pretty much
dedicated his whole life now

25:18.100 --> 25:20.812
to putting message
of health out there

25:20.853 --> 25:23.857
to the urban community.

25:23.898 --> 25:25.817
When I went to his
house, it blew my mind

25:25.858 --> 25:28.987
because we went to Atlanta
and he opens the door

25:29.028 --> 25:32.532
and it just felt so
good in their home.

25:32.573 --> 25:35.618
And for one, it was great
to see healthy black family

25:35.660 --> 25:38.538
doing all this stuff together
and picking vegetables

25:38.580 --> 25:39.830
and cooking them right away

25:39.872 --> 25:41.625
and they're the
prototype in my opinion.

25:41.667 --> 25:46.838
They're very much into the
mind, body and spirit of it all.

25:46.880 --> 25:48.047
There's a Buddhist
story called

25:48.088 --> 25:50.342
of the farmer who knows
what's good or bad.

25:50.383 --> 25:54.178
Farmer's horse runs off his
neighbor comes over and says

25:54.220 --> 25:56.305
ah, I'm sorry you
lost your horse man

25:56.347 --> 25:59.433
and the farmer's he's like,
who knows what's good or bad?

25:59.475 --> 26:02.228
Maybe a week later, that
same horse comes back

26:02.270 --> 26:04.563
with 12 more horses
following him

26:04.605 --> 26:06.148
and so his neighbors
sees all the horses

26:06.190 --> 26:09.277
and he's like, wow
man, what a blessing.

26:09.318 --> 26:12.113
You got all these
new horses for free.

26:12.155 --> 26:15.325
And farmer was just like,
who knows what's good or bad?

26:15.367 --> 26:18.160
Soon after that, the farmer's
son ride one of these

26:18.202 --> 26:20.497
fancy new horses that they got,

26:20.538 --> 26:22.540
falls off and break
his leg though.

26:22.582 --> 26:25.127
So the neighbor
sees that and says,

26:25.168 --> 26:28.170
oh, I'm so sorry what
happened to your son,

26:28.212 --> 26:31.717
but the wise farmer just says,
who knows what's good or bad?

26:31.758 --> 26:34.970
The king of the province
is coming to draft

26:35.012 --> 26:37.972
all the young men for war.

26:38.013 --> 26:41.392
And they get to the farmer's
house to get his farmer's son,

26:41.433 --> 26:45.230
but he got a broken leg, so
he don't have to go to war.

26:45.272 --> 26:49.317
So not just the moral of this
story, but the moral of life.

26:49.358 --> 26:51.402
When we decide is good or bad,

26:51.443 --> 26:53.738
is when we attach a perception.

26:53.780 --> 26:56.323
And that's how we
can be disappointed

26:56.365 --> 26:57.783
and that's how we suffer.

26:57.825 --> 26:59.618
Real disease is when
you have a dis-easement

26:59.660 --> 27:01.078
in yourself and it starts here.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.580
It starts in your brain
and it sends that signal

27:02.622 --> 27:04.082
through the rest of your
body that's feeling dis-ease

27:04.123 --> 27:05.583
and that's why they
call it a disease.

27:05.625 --> 27:07.543
A lot of diseases are like
just you stressing yourself

27:07.585 --> 27:10.297
so far out, over either
something you can't control

27:10.338 --> 27:11.588
or something that's gonna
be controlled anyway.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.090
My mom used to tell me
when I was little like,

27:13.132 --> 27:15.177
cry if you want to, you
just gonna have a headache.

27:15.218 --> 27:16.343
All right your nose gonna be
running, you have a headache,

27:16.385 --> 27:17.928
you still gotta
finish your homework.

27:17.970 --> 27:20.515
So I learned to get
that part out of the way

27:20.557 --> 27:22.350
and learned to get that
stress out of the way.

27:22.392 --> 27:24.560
Kinda take the chains
off of it, let it go.

27:24.602 --> 27:25.978
Whether you realize
it, all day long,

27:26.020 --> 27:27.230
everybody's doing this.

27:27.272 --> 27:28.440
Even whether you
realize it or not.

27:28.482 --> 27:30.150
Being attached to
anything in the world,

27:30.192 --> 27:33.945
valuing anything in the world
will cause you suffering.

27:33.987 --> 27:38.950
So the less you hold
on to this neediness,

27:38.992 --> 27:40.535
the better off you'll be.

27:40.577 --> 27:43.328
And it's not something
that I write it in my book

27:43.372 --> 27:45.123
because it sounds good,
it's something that

27:45.165 --> 27:48.543
Abraham and Jesus and
Mohammad and Lord Buddha

27:48.585 --> 27:50.837
and in The Yoga Sutras, it's
stated over and over again

27:50.878 --> 27:52.713
the smart people
tell us this shit.

27:52.755 --> 27:54.090
Don't attach yourself to things

27:54.132 --> 27:56.133
that have nothing to
do with your happiness.

27:56.175 --> 27:59.137
A business guy,
they're so funny like,

27:59.178 --> 28:02.598
they get some money and
they excited for a second.

28:02.640 --> 28:04.475
They get happy because
the stock exchange goes up

28:04.517 --> 28:07.728
and their heart gets down
'cause the stock goes down.

28:07.770 --> 28:12.108
And their happiness
is manufactured.

28:12.150 --> 28:14.860
People are
literally killing themselves

28:14.902 --> 28:17.655
trying to attain
material wealth.

28:17.697 --> 28:20.450
Cause they thing that's
what's gonna make them happy.

28:24.453 --> 28:26.163
It's all about
how you feel inside

28:26.205 --> 28:29.375
that motivation that keeps
you confident and all that.

28:29.417 --> 28:31.043
Some people buy
the material shit

28:31.085 --> 28:33.588
because ain't nothing
else good about them.

28:33.630 --> 28:36.842
Those outer things
really can come and go.

28:36.883 --> 28:39.843
But what you have
inside is yours.

28:39.885 --> 28:41.470
That yours forever and
that's what you have

28:41.512 --> 28:43.682
to nurture for the
rest of your life

28:43.723 --> 28:47.227
and that's what will sustain
you when you don't have

28:47.268 --> 28:50.522
the change because material
things will come and go.

28:50.563 --> 28:52.273
You will be the hottest
artist at one point

28:52.315 --> 28:53.525
and then at some point,

28:53.567 --> 28:55.527
people be trying to
remember your name.

28:55.568 --> 28:57.195
The human mind and
the subconscious mind

28:57.237 --> 29:00.198
they're the strange pieces
of our equipment too.

29:00.240 --> 29:03.200
Your mind is gonna take
you to that next level,

29:03.242 --> 29:04.702
on where you trying to go.

29:04.743 --> 29:08.080
When you in the playoff
game seven, so to speak,

29:08.122 --> 29:09.998
you really can't
depend on your body.

29:10.040 --> 29:11.458
You have to depend on your mind.

29:11.500 --> 29:12.918
- Know how powerful you are.

29:12.960 --> 29:14.670
Women, we are powerful.

29:14.712 --> 29:18.467
Running in general
is certainly a time

29:18.508 --> 29:22.387
that your thoughts
make or break that run.

29:22.428 --> 29:24.013
If you have a day
where you feel like,

29:24.055 --> 29:25.055
I'm tired.

29:25.097 --> 29:26.057
I'm hot.

29:26.098 --> 29:27.225
This is far.

29:27.267 --> 29:29.893
If you let that
pattern of thoughts go,

29:29.935 --> 29:31.395
you're not having a good run.

29:31.437 --> 29:36.317
And then another day, your
same body, your same mind,

29:36.358 --> 29:38.653
your same road that you run on,

29:38.695 --> 29:41.572
oh, I feel like I
could run for days.

29:41.613 --> 29:43.575
I had energy and I
was just thinking

29:43.617 --> 29:47.037
and it was just beautiful
and your thoughts fed that

29:47.078 --> 29:50.415
but our perception is what
gives us that experience.

29:50.457 --> 29:54.043
Negative or positive or
whatever, it's just perception.

29:54.085 --> 29:55.795
Most of the
time when we don't feel good,

29:55.837 --> 29:57.297
it's because of our thoughts.

29:57.338 --> 29:58.923
We wake up in the morning,
we just have a bad feeling,

29:58.965 --> 30:01.008
a icky feeling or
something like that.

30:01.050 --> 30:04.595
How we react to those
feelings is up to us.

30:04.637 --> 30:06.305
And I think that's what
meditation helps you with.

30:06.347 --> 30:10.100
Is it helps you clear away
sort of the artificial thoughts

30:10.142 --> 30:12.020
and it brings out
the organic thoughts.

30:12.062 --> 30:13.772
That's why we meditate to
practice so the mind can be

30:13.813 --> 30:18.818
slowed down so we don't have
the noise, mind is settled.

30:18.860 --> 30:20.068
This is the kind of stillness,

30:20.110 --> 30:23.447
this kind of focus
that promotes bliss.

30:23.488 --> 30:25.242
The difference I've
noticed with meditation is

30:25.283 --> 30:27.493
we're more peaceful in
ourselves, like we just...

30:27.535 --> 30:30.247
it's a time, that you
can take for yourself

30:30.288 --> 30:31.788
to just be still.

30:31.830 --> 30:34.042
And it allows the
Universe to just open up

30:34.083 --> 30:36.793
and just have things for you
that maybe you weren't able to

30:36.835 --> 30:39.463
see clearly if you
weren't meditating.

30:39.505 --> 30:41.548
It's something about
being in tune with yourself

30:41.590 --> 30:44.468
when you meditating and
just communing with yourself

30:44.510 --> 30:47.305
that is like one of the most
purest things you can do,.

30:47.347 --> 30:49.932
It's nothing outside that
can disturb your world

30:49.973 --> 30:51.850
and it's all you
dealing with you.

30:51.893 --> 30:55.020
The whole idea of
hip-hop in popular culture

30:55.062 --> 30:56.563
or whatever is about cool.

30:56.605 --> 30:59.150
Being under pressure,
having your composure,

30:59.192 --> 31:02.278
nothing can move you
and you just that solid.

31:02.320 --> 31:07.325
Meditation though is a way
to cultivate that real cool.

31:07.367 --> 31:09.202
That actual cool under pressure.

31:09.243 --> 31:12.663
And I think a lot of times,
we carry around a lot of noise

31:12.705 --> 31:14.790
in our head and
when you meditate,

31:14.832 --> 31:16.625
what you're doing is
you're breathing in

31:16.667 --> 31:17.960
and just focusing
on breathing in,

31:18.002 --> 31:20.003
if any other thoughts
come, you say thank you

31:20.045 --> 31:23.465
but no thank you and you try
to just focus on breathing in

31:23.507 --> 31:25.677
as deep as you can
and breathing out.

31:25.718 --> 31:28.178
But what happens is
when we're stressed,

31:28.220 --> 31:30.432
we're taking a breath in, and
as soon as you think about that

31:31.057 --> 31:32.350
stressful thing,
you breath out again

31:32.392 --> 31:33.685
and you're breathing
really shallow

31:33.727 --> 31:34.935
and that's bad for your health.

31:34.977 --> 31:36.353
It makes you more stressed.

31:36.395 --> 31:39.440
Right, breathing shallow
is a fear response.

31:39.482 --> 31:40.817
So, when you're
taking deep breaths

31:40.858 --> 31:42.360
and just focusing on one thing,

31:42.402 --> 31:44.945
a lot of that other noise
and stress just falls away.

31:44.987 --> 31:48.032
Breathing though life, is
the solution to everything.

31:48.073 --> 31:53.453
If we all took a deep breath
before we made a poor decision,

31:53.495 --> 31:54.913
you know maybe we
wouldn't make it.

31:54.955 --> 31:57.708
When you use meditation
along with eating a whole foods

31:57.750 --> 32:01.337
plant-based diet, some
walking and moderate exercise

32:01.378 --> 32:03.380
and spending more time
with your loved ones.

32:03.422 --> 32:05.842
That these simple changes
can not only help prevent,

32:05.883 --> 32:08.970
but even reverse the most
common and serious conditions.

32:09.012 --> 32:10.597
It can lower your
blood pressure,

32:10.638 --> 32:12.557
it can lower your
cholesterol levels even.

32:12.598 --> 32:15.768
What we're finding is is
that transcendental meditation

32:15.810 --> 32:18.520
when offered in
underserved urban schools,

32:18.562 --> 32:21.648
that's there's a dramatic
transformation in that school

32:21.690 --> 32:24.443
when now every child or
teenager in the school

32:24.485 --> 32:27.238
has the ability for
10 minutes twice a day

32:27.280 --> 32:30.240
to close his or her eyes
as part of the school day

32:30.282 --> 32:33.953
and just experience a state
of rest and relaxation.

32:33.995 --> 32:35.413
Deeper than sleep.

32:35.455 --> 32:40.793
The child is alert, calm,
wide-awake and for education,

32:40.835 --> 32:42.587
they call learning readiness
the most important thing

32:42.628 --> 32:44.380
in education and for
learning readiness,

32:44.422 --> 32:46.632
what they want is
restful alertness.

32:46.673 --> 32:49.677
Kids, rather than having
all the distractions and noise

32:49.718 --> 32:55.223
in their mind need to be
free to act accordingly.

32:55.265 --> 32:57.518
A kid becomes a better
student, becomes less violent,

32:57.560 --> 32:59.353
anxiety disappears.

32:59.395 --> 33:03.190
You know it's so many
issues that youth deal with

33:03.232 --> 33:08.822
that I don't think they have
an outlet for that sometimes.

33:08.863 --> 33:13.242
Meditation can help them to
just be centered, you know.

33:13.283 --> 33:15.995
It gives you a confidence, it
gives you a sense of peace.

33:16.037 --> 33:19.457
The need for transcendental
meditation or quiet time

33:19.498 --> 33:22.752
in schools is absolutely
unequivocally apparent.

33:22.793 --> 33:25.295
10 million children
suffer from depression

33:25.337 --> 33:27.465
and they're on
antidepressant medication.

33:27.507 --> 33:30.300
Five million children
are diagnosed with ADHD

33:30.342 --> 33:33.595
and other learning disorders
and the number three cause

33:33.637 --> 33:37.308
of death in America among
teenagers is suicide.

33:37.350 --> 33:38.810
So they
actually did a study

33:38.852 --> 33:41.020
that showed that a 10
year old kid that grows up

33:41.062 --> 33:43.188
like in the distressed
urban neighborhood

33:43.230 --> 33:46.150
is dealing with the same
level of post-traumatic stress

33:46.192 --> 33:47.485
as a man or woman coming back

33:47.527 --> 33:50.447
from combat in Iraq
or Afghanistan.

33:50.488 --> 33:53.490
You also know that when
a child doesn't graduate,

33:53.532 --> 33:55.660
they enter the prison
pipeline to the tune of

33:55.702 --> 34:00.957
a two million dollar per
child bill to society.

34:00.998 --> 34:02.500
And there's like 40%
drop out rate now

34:02.542 --> 34:04.335
in our inner-city high schools.

34:04.377 --> 34:07.045
And you can't
medicate that away,

34:07.088 --> 34:12.635
and you can't give every
child in-depth counseling,

34:12.677 --> 34:15.597
but what you can do is equip
them with a simple tool

34:15.638 --> 34:19.308
that anyone of them can learn
easily, instantaneously.

34:19.350 --> 34:20.893
- So pick a sound.

34:20.935 --> 34:23.478
There are lots of sounds
that people meditate on,

34:23.520 --> 34:29.152
the om, shalom, salaam, amin,
amen, it can be anything.

34:29.193 --> 34:31.487
Close your eyes and do that.

34:31.527 --> 34:33.112
And let it fill up
your whole breath.

34:33.155 --> 34:34.239
So take a breath in.

34:34.282 --> 34:35.742
Om.

34:35.783 --> 34:37.202
'Til you run out of air.

34:37.243 --> 34:38.118
Do it again.

34:38.159 --> 34:39.661
Stop, do it again.

34:39.703 --> 34:41.496
Now, what's gonna happen,
your mind will wander,

34:41.538 --> 34:42.623
you'll start to think
about, I gotta do this,

34:42.665 --> 34:43.875
I forgot to do that.

34:43.917 --> 34:45.042
Soon as you become
aware you're thinking

34:45.083 --> 34:46.835
about something
else, bring it back.

34:46.877 --> 34:48.212
Over and over and over again.

34:48.253 --> 34:49.713
That's meditation.

34:49.755 --> 34:52.382
So you start seeing an
improvement in test scores,

34:52.425 --> 34:55.260
studies that were done in San
Francisco public high schools,

34:55.302 --> 34:58.055
the worst schools have
become among the best schools

34:58.097 --> 35:01.183
in the district, test scores
for example for English

35:01.225 --> 35:03.727
and Math 40% improvement
in test scores.

35:03.768 --> 35:06.063
There are so many
thousands of kids,

35:06.105 --> 35:08.482
who you would never
think would meditate,

35:08.523 --> 35:10.652
once they learn it,
they never wanna stop.

35:10.693 --> 35:13.737
I think people would be
shocked what a big difference

35:13.778 --> 35:16.407
three minutes of meditation
can do for your life.

35:16.448 --> 35:18.450
Especially single mothers
who have sold custody

35:18.492 --> 35:19.993
of their kids and there's
a lot of stress 'cause

35:20.035 --> 35:22.747
they're working and then they
come right home to their kids,

35:22.788 --> 35:24.623
meditation would
change their life.

35:24.665 --> 35:26.917
- Poverty makes you very angry.

35:26.958 --> 35:30.128
It's very hard to work
everyday and still can't afford

35:30.170 --> 35:32.590
transportation, it's very
hard to work everyday

35:32.632 --> 35:34.800
and not afford decent housing.

35:34.842 --> 35:38.595
It's very debilitating to you
emotionally and physically

35:38.637 --> 35:42.267
at times and I became a
single mother by choice,

35:42.308 --> 35:43.935
my son when I was
in high school,

35:43.977 --> 35:47.772
I adopted my son from the
community because my grandparents

35:47.813 --> 35:50.482
took care of me and so I was
doing something that I knew

35:50.525 --> 35:54.070
needed to be done, but I didn't
have the resources to do it.

35:54.112 --> 35:56.905
And that did make me angry,
it made me angry to struggle

35:56.947 --> 35:59.533
day in and day out,
despite working full time

35:59.575 --> 36:01.452
and still be living in poverty.

36:01.493 --> 36:03.162
And so many people
who are single mothers

36:03.203 --> 36:04.663
in disadvantaged situations,

36:04.705 --> 36:07.040
don't feel very powerful
at all, you feel helpless.

36:07.082 --> 36:08.708
'Cause you don't feel like
you have much control.

36:08.750 --> 36:10.628
Meditation gives you
a way out of that.

36:10.670 --> 36:12.672
It gives you a sense of
being in control again.

36:12.713 --> 36:14.048
Of empowering yourself.

36:14.090 --> 36:16.217
You know, before
the kids wake up,

36:16.258 --> 36:17.593
before anybody's up
before you have to do

36:17.635 --> 36:19.678
any of your motherly duties,

36:19.720 --> 36:21.263
just take your moment.

36:21.305 --> 36:24.350
Your five, ten minutes and just.

36:24.392 --> 36:27.812
If you going through some
struggle and you're upset

36:27.853 --> 36:30.940
or you're angry and
if you take the time,

36:30.982 --> 36:33.400
you will settle and
you'll say, wow,

36:33.442 --> 36:36.445
you don't have to be at
the mercy of these emotions

36:36.487 --> 36:37.905
and things like that.

36:37.947 --> 36:40.157
They reminded me
that I had potential,

36:40.198 --> 36:42.452
and I had the
ability to achieve.

36:42.493 --> 36:45.955
It seems improbable that
I could come from poverty

36:45.997 --> 36:49.917
as a single mother to
become a PHD holder.

36:49.958 --> 36:51.627
But it's very possible
when you're willing to

36:52.043 --> 36:54.047
invest in yourselves
and in your children

36:54.088 --> 36:56.840
and you set the limits
to how far you can go.

36:56.882 --> 36:59.593
If the mamas are out
there loving themselves

36:59.635 --> 37:01.803
and taking care of
themselves and showing that

37:01.845 --> 37:04.682
to their children and
stepping up in a major way.

37:04.723 --> 37:07.768
I think when a young man
sees his mom in that light,

37:07.810 --> 37:09.395
like it changes his world.

37:09.437 --> 37:12.315
If you want your kid to
be invested in the world

37:12.357 --> 37:15.150
in a happy way and not
an anxiety-prone way,

37:15.192 --> 37:17.152
learn to meditate and
teach your children.

37:17.193 --> 37:19.363
As soon as you meditate and
you keep your thoughts still,

37:19.405 --> 37:22.240
then all of a sudden what
really is important will surface

37:22.283 --> 37:25.243
and I think that more people
will find that self-love

37:25.285 --> 37:27.622
through meditation and then
they'll wanna eat healthier

37:27.663 --> 37:29.790
and wanna treat people
in a different way.

37:29.832 --> 37:32.543
So I think it all starts in
the mind and in the spirit.

37:32.585 --> 37:34.712
Well this will be
the last White House

37:34.753 --> 37:37.340
Kitchen Garden planting for me.

37:37.382 --> 37:41.218
Yeah, it was eight years
ago that we cooked up this

37:41.260 --> 37:46.723
really interesting idea that
maybe we could dig up some dirt

37:46.765 --> 37:49.227
on the South lawn, maybe
somebody would let us do that,

37:49.268 --> 37:54.607
and we would plant a
wonderful garden that would be

37:54.648 --> 37:58.568
a space for us to talk
about the food we eat.

37:58.610 --> 38:00.153
When you
talk about holistic health

38:00.195 --> 38:01.655
as it relates to
the urban community

38:01.697 --> 38:04.325
because of the homicide
rates and the poverty rates

38:04.367 --> 38:06.410
and the stress levels there,

38:06.452 --> 38:08.078
you're gonna need different
types of solutions.

38:08.120 --> 38:09.830
My name's Ron
Finley and we're in

38:09.872 --> 38:12.333
South Central, Los Angeles.

38:12.375 --> 38:13.875
Home of the drive-by.

38:13.917 --> 38:17.212
Right behind us is what I like
to call my urban food source.

38:17.253 --> 38:19.257
What inspired me to
create this food for us

38:19.298 --> 38:22.385
is the lack of healthy
food in this community.

38:22.427 --> 38:24.803
I wanted people to see that
you can grow your own food

38:24.845 --> 38:27.473
and stop waiting for
others to do it for you.

38:27.515 --> 38:28.973
Grow your own food,
empower yourself,

38:29.017 --> 38:30.142
empower your community.

38:30.183 --> 38:31.852
I wanted people to see how easy

38:31.893 --> 38:33.478
and how beautiful it could be.

38:33.520 --> 38:36.690
I just wanna bring back the
health to this community.

38:36.732 --> 38:38.525
So with
all these food desserts,

38:38.567 --> 38:40.235
there's also a lot of
bright spots out there.

38:40.277 --> 38:42.278
We went to Detroit and
met with a company called

38:42.320 --> 38:43.530
Urban Gardening.

38:43.572 --> 38:46.617
I'm from Minneapolis,
but I lived on a farm

38:46.658 --> 38:48.660
for three and half
years in my teens.

38:48.702 --> 38:51.997
So when I saw all of that
unused land in the city,

38:52.038 --> 38:54.667
my mind thought, well why
don't we just plant food

38:54.708 --> 38:56.127
on that land?

38:56.168 --> 38:59.088
So I put my recording
career on the back burner

38:59.130 --> 39:00.923
and I started Urban Farming

39:00.965 --> 39:03.758
and we started with three
gardens in Detroit, Michigan.

39:03.800 --> 39:05.845
This is one of the
very first pamphlets

39:05.887 --> 39:08.013
that I started
Urban Farming with.

39:08.055 --> 39:10.140
Let everybody know that we
were getting ready to start

39:10.182 --> 39:13.893
planting gardens so then in
2005, we really got started,

39:13.935 --> 39:16.647
this is the first garden
planting that we did.

39:16.688 --> 39:19.817
We grew in the second year,
we expanded into Minneapolis

39:19.858 --> 39:22.903
St. Louis, New York,
Jamaica and Los Angeles.

39:22.945 --> 39:24.405
This is a running ticker tape.

39:24.447 --> 39:26.698
It's in real time so as
soon as somebody registers

39:26.740 --> 39:29.577
their garden, anywhere in
the world this number goes up

39:29.618 --> 39:32.538
and your garden will
appear on the global map.

39:32.580 --> 39:35.665
And again, it started in
Detroit with just three gardens.

39:35.707 --> 39:37.835
My name is Rashid Nuri,
I'm the President and Founder

39:37.877 --> 39:41.838
of Truly Living Well Center
for National Urban Agriculture.

39:41.880 --> 39:44.675
We produce over 30,000
pounds of food each year.

39:44.717 --> 39:45.592
And we distribute it through our

39:45.633 --> 39:47.512
community supported agriculture.

39:47.553 --> 39:50.180
We sell it to some of the
finest restaurants in town.

39:50.222 --> 39:53.725
We give double value to
folks who are on food stamps

39:53.767 --> 39:55.770
and if someone is hungry
we just give them food.

39:55.812 --> 39:58.480
80% of Americans,
live in cities.

39:58.522 --> 40:00.190
So that's why urban
agriculture's becoming

40:00.232 --> 40:01.608
more and more important,

40:01.650 --> 40:03.318
we are proving the
economic viability

40:03.360 --> 40:04.695
of the urban agriculture.

40:04.737 --> 40:06.363
So it's all about deciding
how we're gonna have

40:06.405 --> 40:09.658
abundant food systems
within urban settings.

40:09.700 --> 40:11.577
Many organizations now
in the United States,

40:11.618 --> 40:13.662
schools, faith-based
institutions,

40:13.703 --> 40:14.872
non-profit organizations,

40:14.913 --> 40:17.082
have land and due to the
fact that we're having

40:17.123 --> 40:18.958
nutritional challenges
with our health

40:19.000 --> 40:21.878
all throughout our community
these organizations are trying

40:21.920 --> 40:23.838
to revisit their missions.

40:23.880 --> 40:26.592
We are in the Third Ward
area of Houston, Texas.

40:26.633 --> 40:28.093
At Alabama Gardens.

40:28.135 --> 40:30.428
This property here belongs
to Texas Southern University

40:30.470 --> 40:33.473
and they let us use this
property to grow vegetables.

40:33.515 --> 40:35.725
We have 56 plots in
here and what we grow

40:35.767 --> 40:38.978
we take care of families then
we take care of food banks.

40:39.020 --> 40:42.525
I want people to be able
to take the food system back

40:42.567 --> 40:44.360
because it's been taken from us.

40:44.402 --> 40:46.237
There's over 400 and
something kinds of carrots.

40:46.278 --> 40:48.780
You lucky if you find three
of them in the stores,

40:48.822 --> 40:50.198
it's the same thing with apples.

40:50.240 --> 40:52.493
They narrow our
food choices down,

40:52.535 --> 40:55.703
so basically this whole food
reality thing is manufactured

40:55.745 --> 40:57.247
for us and you're just
'sposed to follow it,

40:57.288 --> 40:59.250
so I wanna bring
this whole palate,

40:59.292 --> 41:01.835
this whole color that
we used to have in food,

41:01.877 --> 41:03.795
I wanna bring that back so
that's what I'm telling people

41:03.837 --> 41:06.215
get gangster with their
parkway and grow some food.

41:06.257 --> 41:09.260
Growing your own
food, being healthy,

41:09.302 --> 41:12.345
taking back your community,
not terrorizing your community,

41:12.387 --> 41:13.805
that's gangster to me.

41:13.847 --> 41:16.558
Local food is being pushed
throughout the markets,

41:16.600 --> 41:18.310
and yet we don't
have enough growers.

41:18.352 --> 41:20.687
And we definitely don't have
enough growers of color,

41:20.728 --> 41:22.898
that are in a space where
they are able to sustain

41:22.940 --> 41:25.275
themselves and provide
for their family.

41:25.317 --> 41:27.528
So we wanna figure out
how we can bring in our,

41:27.570 --> 41:30.280
do-for-self attitude with the
skills and the technologies

41:30.322 --> 41:32.407
that allow us to grow
abundant amount of food

41:32.448 --> 41:33.783
on small spaces.

41:33.825 --> 41:35.493
- You can grow food, anywhere.

41:35.535 --> 41:37.955
You know, you can grow food
in a box on your balcony,

41:37.997 --> 41:39.540
you can grow food in buckets

41:39.582 --> 41:42.292
and I tell people if it's some
soil, put something in it.

41:42.333 --> 41:44.085
Because food should be free.

41:44.127 --> 41:46.255
It's like printing
your own money, period.

41:46.297 --> 41:47.798
One of the things
that people said to me

41:47.840 --> 41:49.800
when we first started is,
you gotta put fences around

41:49.842 --> 41:53.053
the gardens and I said
why, they said because

41:53.095 --> 41:54.472
they're gonna steal the food.

41:54.513 --> 41:55.973
And I said, well there's
nothing to steal,

41:56.015 --> 41:57.642
that the food is free.

41:57.683 --> 41:59.977
You cannot eat all of the
food that you can grow,

42:00.018 --> 42:01.228
it's damn near impossible,

42:01.270 --> 42:03.980
you will be eating
all day every day.

42:04.022 --> 42:06.733
Just imagine if we had
a place where everybody

42:06.775 --> 42:08.693
had their parkways planted.

42:08.735 --> 42:11.405
Now you have a community
that's engaged and wanna...

42:11.447 --> 42:13.032
I can tells somebody
hey, go over to Quincy's

42:13.073 --> 42:14.533
and get me some carrots.

42:14.575 --> 42:16.410
I can send my son over there
and you can send your son

42:16.452 --> 42:18.495
over to my house
and get some onions.

42:18.537 --> 42:20.580
Gardens build community
and that's real,

42:20.622 --> 42:21.998
that's just period, it does.

42:22.040 --> 42:24.377
What's important is getting
people to break bread,

42:24.418 --> 42:27.087
to have conversation, the
community and the society

42:27.128 --> 42:29.923
becomes more civil when
they're able to share

42:29.965 --> 42:31.383
and to be healthy.

42:31.425 --> 42:32.843
- Through urban agriculture,

42:32.885 --> 42:35.470
you can find a way to address
most of the urban ills,

42:35.512 --> 42:37.180
whether it's people overweight,

42:37.222 --> 42:40.683
creating green spaces, giving
work for community service.

42:40.725 --> 42:42.352
We also work with
returning citizens

42:42.393 --> 42:44.228
that are coming out of
jail and they need to get

42:44.272 --> 42:46.982
community service hours, they
would do that on our gardens,

42:47.023 --> 42:50.235
but the difference was
they're not making money

42:50.277 --> 42:53.363
for somebody else, they're
actually cultivating this food

42:53.405 --> 42:55.157
for the community,
for themselves,

42:55.198 --> 42:56.575
for their family and friends.

42:56.617 --> 42:58.702
Basically this
is against the law

42:58.743 --> 43:01.413
because the city
owns this property

43:01.455 --> 43:03.040
but you have to maintain it.

43:03.082 --> 43:05.375
It's ridiculous because we
have all this barren land

43:05.417 --> 43:07.043
and all this space around here

43:07.085 --> 43:09.003
that serves no
purpose whatsoever.

43:09.045 --> 43:10.338
I wanna get something out of it.

43:10.380 --> 43:12.633
We're not cows, we
can't eat grass.

43:12.675 --> 43:14.343
Why wouldn't we
plant food on that...

43:14.385 --> 43:16.678
like why would people
be going hungry?

43:16.720 --> 43:18.805
There used to be a day and age

43:18.847 --> 43:21.267
when people when
they saw unused land,

43:21.308 --> 43:23.810
they immediately
thought about planting.

43:23.852 --> 43:25.728
There are a lot of black
folk that wanna have nothing

43:25.770 --> 43:27.397
to do with growing anything
and think what we're doing

43:27.438 --> 43:28.857
is too close to slavery.

43:28.898 --> 43:31.443
The older people in particular
who are only one or two

43:31.485 --> 43:33.320
generations out of slavery,
don't wanna do this.

43:33.362 --> 43:35.905
Not understanding that
the earth is where

43:35.947 --> 43:37.407
all the wealth comes from.

43:37.448 --> 43:40.368
Yeah that legacy does
exist with slavery,

43:40.410 --> 43:42.872
you know the whole, well,
we don't do in the dirt.

43:42.913 --> 43:45.582
Oh I don't do worms and I think
we have to flip the script

43:45.623 --> 43:47.417
and let these people know.

43:47.458 --> 43:48.918
No this is powerful.

43:48.960 --> 43:53.423
You control your destiny,
soil to me is powerful.

43:56.968 --> 43:59.638
I hear a lot of people say
when you bring up being healthy

43:59.680 --> 44:01.640
or being vegan or being
in shape and all that is

44:01.682 --> 44:04.435
I think a lot of people under
the impression that you need

44:04.477 --> 44:07.938
to be wealthy or
be rich or famous.

44:07.980 --> 44:10.065
Our true nature
going back to Africa

44:10.107 --> 44:12.483
is to be healthy and
eco-friendly, you know.

44:12.525 --> 44:14.235
To this day, we're very
eco-friendly and healthy there.

44:14.277 --> 44:16.238
In Africa they don't really
believe in eating food

44:16.280 --> 44:19.367
that's been refrigerated, they
wanna pick everything fresh,

44:19.408 --> 44:22.202
whether it's meat or
vegetables or fruits,

44:22.243 --> 44:23.662
everything is very fresh.

44:23.703 --> 44:25.247
So it's actually
part of our nature,

44:25.288 --> 44:26.790
but we've gotten away from that.

44:26.832 --> 44:29.502
We have more to learn by far
from them in terms of wisdom,

44:29.543 --> 44:33.255
quite frankly just being
happy, you know what I mean.

44:33.297 --> 44:34.507
Like, I'm being serious,
everybody's happy,

44:34.548 --> 44:35.965
they're feeling good.

44:36.007 --> 44:37.843
It's a lot of lessons I think
we could learn from here.

44:37.885 --> 44:40.470
Just seeing our essence
in a different light.

44:40.512 --> 44:43.140
They got probably far
more struggles than we do,

44:43.182 --> 44:46.143
but the way they process
it, it's just so different.

44:46.185 --> 44:49.397
So very endearing and there's
a lot of love and warmth here.

44:55.318 --> 45:00.240
We don't have good toilets,
we don't have good bath house,

45:00.282 --> 45:03.077
you know, we just maintaining.

45:03.118 --> 45:07.372
You see always I
tell myself that

45:07.413 --> 45:10.750
I can see joy through the
pain because when it comes to

45:10.792 --> 45:13.587
the ghetto all you see
is pain but everybody

45:13.628 --> 45:15.797
just humble and cool.

45:21.928 --> 45:24.682
Your strengths,
come from Africa.

45:24.723 --> 45:28.310
The advantage that you
have over everybody else

45:28.352 --> 45:31.647
in the world really,
is your African-ness.

45:31.688 --> 45:34.608
When slaves ended up in America,
they didn't suddenly forget

45:34.650 --> 45:37.610
everything that they had
learned, you know what I mean.

45:37.652 --> 45:39.028
And how they treat
their children

45:39.070 --> 45:40.280
and how they treat their parents

45:40.322 --> 45:42.407
and how they treat their
brothers and sisters.

45:42.448 --> 45:43.992
So if African-Americans
didn't have that

45:44.033 --> 45:45.993
African in the them,
they'd be just like

45:46.035 --> 45:48.455
the rest of the people,
you know what I mean.

45:48.497 --> 45:54.043
Their value in spite of all
the hurdles and obstacles

45:54.085 --> 45:56.838
and victimization and things
which have been thrown in

45:56.880 --> 45:59.633
the paths of African-Americans

45:59.675 --> 46:01.050
they have been able to overcome.

46:01.092 --> 46:02.718
We shall overcome.

46:07.515 --> 46:11.102
Stabilizing the food system
allows for the great thinkers,

46:11.145 --> 46:13.813
the great musicians, the great
healers, the great teachers

46:13.855 --> 46:15.607
to come because
they're being born

46:15.648 --> 46:18.152
into a society that
nourishes them.

46:18.193 --> 46:21.447
We grew food as a
communion with nature

46:21.488 --> 46:23.282
with the understanding
that everyone should eat.

46:23.323 --> 46:24.908
The elders should eat,
the children should eat,

46:24.950 --> 46:27.285
but everyone should eat
the best possible food.

46:27.327 --> 46:29.037
So we can get the
best possible results

46:29.078 --> 46:31.582
from every member
of this society.

46:31.623 --> 46:34.710
So what happens once we
monetize the food system?

46:34.752 --> 46:37.128
The best food was being
sold or distributed

46:37.170 --> 46:39.422
to just certain
people so then you had

46:39.463 --> 46:42.425
a huge population
that was malnourished.

46:42.467 --> 46:45.762
If you're constantly worried
about how you're gonna eat,

46:45.803 --> 46:49.307
that's a file folder that
never shuts down in your mind.

46:49.348 --> 46:52.643
So, all your energy is
going into that problem.

46:52.685 --> 46:54.938
But if you can take that
problem off your plate,

46:54.980 --> 46:57.148
then you might be able
to start thinking about,

46:57.190 --> 47:00.152
oh well I'd like to get
training to get a job

47:00.193 --> 47:04.113
and I can now put my energy
into that and ultimately,

47:04.155 --> 47:06.992
people who have jobs, people
who are getting training,

47:07.033 --> 47:08.952
that's what you want
in a healthy city.

47:08.993 --> 47:10.453
I said if you can't
eat, you can't think

47:10.495 --> 47:11.913
and if you can't
think, you can't learn

47:11.955 --> 47:13.748
and if you can't
learn, you can't earn.

47:13.790 --> 47:15.917
I'll give you an example of
one young man that I met,

47:15.958 --> 47:18.212
he said to me that I used
to work in these gardens,

47:18.253 --> 47:19.547
as a volunteer and I said,

47:19.588 --> 47:21.298
really, what are you doing now?

47:21.340 --> 47:23.342
And he said, well I'm a
male nurse and I said,

47:23.383 --> 47:24.802
wow, that's great.

47:24.843 --> 47:27.762
How'd you start to become
that and how did that happen?

47:27.803 --> 47:30.348
And he said well, from urban
farming, from what I did

47:30.390 --> 47:33.143
I learned how to care for
something outside of myself.

47:33.185 --> 47:35.187
It's more than a
gardening organization.

47:35.228 --> 47:36.145
Why?

47:36.187 --> 47:37.647
We talk about healthy eating,

47:37.688 --> 47:39.650
we talk about healthy thinking,

47:39.692 --> 47:43.153
we talk about healthy
finances, healthy fitness,

47:43.195 --> 47:44.905
healthy families.

47:44.947 --> 47:48.158
It's a holistic
approach to healing.

47:48.200 --> 47:49.827
- You know in terms of finding,

47:49.868 --> 47:51.995
the healthy community
wherever you live,

47:52.037 --> 47:53.913
like finding that group of
people that you can sort of

47:53.955 --> 47:56.165
be peers with and when
you're around people

47:56.207 --> 47:57.625
that are healthy,

47:57.667 --> 47:59.210
automatically you pick
up a lot of their habits.

47:59.252 --> 48:05.258
So this is our fridge, and
so since we're vegetarians,

48:05.342 --> 48:06.677
it's a lot of veggies.

48:06.718 --> 48:09.053
So if you're around successful
people who wanna treat

48:09.095 --> 48:11.807
themselves well, you're gonna
probably fall into that.

48:11.848 --> 48:13.808
If you're around people
who wanna do something bad

48:13.850 --> 48:16.270
to other people and
have a negative mindset,

48:16.312 --> 48:17.853
you're gonna fall into that.

48:17.895 --> 48:19.522
I think people don't
eat healthy in the hood

48:19.563 --> 48:22.317
because they're not hip to it

48:22.358 --> 48:24.027
and you get caught up
when you in the hood,

48:24.068 --> 48:25.695
in just what's around you.

48:25.737 --> 48:29.783
They don't know that the people
that are living the longest

48:29.825 --> 48:32.910
and living the best pretty
much try to eat healthy.

48:32.953 --> 48:36.247
I was tired of just eating
fast food like, for me,

48:36.290 --> 48:39.292
from me having common knowledge
of how I was growing up

48:39.333 --> 48:42.545
cause when at home I would
eat veggies and fruits.

48:42.587 --> 48:45.048
I was missing all of that
because I was going with

48:45.090 --> 48:49.010
too much fried food,
too much, just too much.

48:49.052 --> 48:52.555
So I started thinking, damn,
I need to start juicing up.

48:52.597 --> 48:55.975
To somewhat balance it out
or just throw something good

48:56.017 --> 48:58.228
in my body because it has
so much bad in my body.

48:58.270 --> 48:59.688
It just became like
part of my culture

48:59.730 --> 49:01.523
and part of my way of life

49:01.565 --> 49:03.775
and the more I kept
living like that,

49:03.817 --> 49:06.612
I started noticing
over a period of time,

49:06.653 --> 49:08.655
I stopped eating fast food.

49:08.697 --> 49:10.573
I start eating at home better.

49:10.615 --> 49:12.117
I start shopping
better for myself,

49:12.158 --> 49:15.203
I start doing more baked
things more grilled things.

49:15.245 --> 49:17.747
Eating more veggies,
drinking more juices,

49:17.788 --> 49:20.083
then I started noticing
the change in my body.

49:20.125 --> 49:21.877
Then I was feeling real
great about myself,

49:21.918 --> 49:23.545
I lost a lot of
weight and I was like,

49:23.587 --> 49:27.007
wow, like this really
really really works.

49:27.048 --> 49:29.592
It's something
about living healthy

49:29.633 --> 49:31.803
that gives you a
different energy.

49:31.845 --> 49:33.263
Like you know what I mean?

49:33.305 --> 49:34.932
And this is what people don't
tell you and this is real,

49:34.973 --> 49:37.100
this what we try to
share at Juices for Life.

49:37.142 --> 49:39.435
Something about living
healthy gives your engine,

49:39.477 --> 49:40.687
it's like cleaning it out.

49:40.728 --> 49:43.107
Juicing up, eating
right and exercising

49:43.148 --> 49:44.607
is gonna help you in your life.

49:44.648 --> 49:47.777
That's what it's about so
we could all live right.

49:47.818 --> 49:49.528
This is what in.

49:49.570 --> 49:52.865
Line anybody who you like,
any modern pop star you like,

49:52.907 --> 49:56.202
any rapper you like,
any athlete you like,

49:56.243 --> 49:57.287
this is what they do.

49:57.328 --> 49:58.872
This is the key to cool.

49:58.913 --> 50:00.207
Juice up.

50:00.248 --> 50:01.458
Steam your food.

50:01.500 --> 50:02.458
Exercise.

50:02.500 --> 50:03.293
Health is wealth.

50:03.335 --> 50:04.502
Movement is medicine.

50:04.543 --> 50:05.962
Feel rich.

50:06.003 --> 50:11.175
Now I've been to Atlanta tons
of times since my early 20s

50:11.217 --> 50:13.178
I been coming to Atlanta
for the last 20, 30 years

50:13.220 --> 50:16.557
and I never knew there was
a vegan urban community

50:16.598 --> 50:18.392
within the Atlanta scene.

50:18.433 --> 50:22.187
I didn't know that.

50:22.228 --> 50:25.565
We are at Soul Vegetarian
in Midtown Atlanta,

50:25.607 --> 50:27.858
this is like one of the
restaurants that I had to find

50:27.900 --> 50:29.402
when I became a vegan,
cause I think people,

50:29.443 --> 50:31.988
they have misconstrued
what vegans eat,

50:32.030 --> 50:33.740
that we can't eat
the same type of food

50:33.782 --> 50:36.743
or it's not as good
as the regular food.

50:36.785 --> 50:39.955
And this place is a
soul food restaurant,

50:39.997 --> 50:43.625
that speaks to that
anybody that's saying that.

50:43.667 --> 50:46.293
They got greens, potato
salad, cornbread,

50:46.335 --> 50:49.172
rice and gravy, it's just
cooked in a different way.

50:49.213 --> 50:52.508
You can't eat organic and
then go back to eating crap.

50:52.550 --> 50:55.928
Oh, I know I'm doing wrong.

50:55.970 --> 50:57.680
It's like I'm giving
myself cancer right now,

50:57.722 --> 51:00.558
eating this hamburger.

51:00.600 --> 51:05.980
I became a vegan after I
went on like a 22 day fast.

51:06.022 --> 51:07.565
The way your body feels
as you clean your body,

51:07.607 --> 51:09.192
you just can put that
stuff back in there.

51:09.233 --> 51:12.237
So I wasn't really on the
mindset to become a vegan,

51:12.278 --> 51:14.613
I was thinking I had to
just start eating cleaner.

51:14.655 --> 51:17.617
But I felt so clean, I
was just like, I'm not.

51:17.658 --> 51:19.077
I'mma go all the way with it.

51:19.118 --> 51:20.370
And the fast
basically let you know

51:20.412 --> 51:22.497
that the majority of the
time when you're hungry,

51:22.538 --> 51:25.083
it's more mental than it
actually is real hunger.

51:25.125 --> 51:27.502
People have this
term that they say,

51:27.543 --> 51:29.503
I need a comfort food.

51:29.545 --> 51:32.882
And so many times, people
turn to food for comfort.

51:32.923 --> 51:34.802
But when I came to
Project Row Houses,

51:34.843 --> 51:36.803
you know I made a
real concerted effort

51:36.845 --> 51:39.055
to have a holistic
change in approach.

51:39.097 --> 51:41.517
And I realized that food
didn't need to comfort me.

51:41.558 --> 51:44.518
I had people, community
activities to comfort me.

51:44.560 --> 51:46.395
You know on the quest
to holistic living,

51:46.437 --> 51:48.565
I think one of the most
important things is to learn

51:48.607 --> 51:51.233
to become aware of yourself
and I started to know myself

51:51.275 --> 51:53.570
and know that I felt better
when I was eating fish.

51:53.612 --> 51:55.905
It had to be a clean,
good fish you know?

51:55.947 --> 51:57.907
Don't get me wrong, some
days I still go home

51:57.948 --> 52:00.743
an eat some catfish
that my mother bought,

52:00.785 --> 52:02.995
but that's not what I
would do on the everyday.

52:03.037 --> 52:04.580
One thing they don't tell
you at the grocery store,

52:04.622 --> 52:05.790
you go to the outer perimeter,

52:05.832 --> 52:08.252
that's where all the
good healthy food is at.

52:08.293 --> 52:09.418
The inside on the shelves

52:09.460 --> 52:10.962
is where all the
processed food's at.

52:11.003 --> 52:12.755
All the stuff that's bad for
you, just go to the outside.

52:12.797 --> 52:15.300
The more color you have
in your food, the better.

52:15.342 --> 52:20.847
So, I try to put tomato,
onion, bell pepper,

52:20.888 --> 52:22.848
all these things in every
meal that I prepare.

52:22.890 --> 52:24.600
You notice how low
the prices are too.

52:24.642 --> 52:26.310
And most of these
prices are per pound,

52:26.352 --> 52:28.272
and this isn't even a pound.

52:28.313 --> 52:30.357
This celery right here,
for a price of a Snicker,

52:30.398 --> 52:32.567
this about six or seven
snacks right here.

52:32.608 --> 52:34.443
For the price of one Snicker.

52:34.485 --> 52:36.697
I'm noticing some
things that I used to eat

52:36.738 --> 52:38.740
that I don't eat
as much anymore.

52:38.782 --> 52:40.242
I love brisket.

52:40.283 --> 52:42.910
But brisket's not a every
weekend meal for me anymore.

52:42.952 --> 52:45.080
Other things that
I always pass up,

52:45.122 --> 52:47.707
pre-processed,
pre-packaged things.

52:47.748 --> 52:49.500
'cause I don't know
what's being put on them,

52:49.542 --> 52:51.377
I don't know what goes
into cooking that,

52:51.418 --> 52:53.713
but I know that I'm gonna
put only heart-healthy

52:53.755 --> 52:55.923
and healthy things on my meat.

52:55.965 --> 52:57.592
I ain't even know there
was a difference from

52:57.633 --> 53:01.137
fried and bake or broil,

53:01.178 --> 53:03.223
I just thought
everything was fried.

53:03.265 --> 53:05.475
There is a difference,
there is a choice.

53:05.517 --> 53:08.895
You can justify eating
anything, you know.

53:10.522 --> 53:11.565
I've heard some funny
lines about guys

53:11.607 --> 53:13.900
make up these lies about food.

53:13.942 --> 53:17.028
For me to be able to say,
I'm not going to eat meat,

53:17.070 --> 53:18.780
and I'm not going to eat dairy,

53:18.822 --> 53:20.990
it gave me a
discipline that help...

53:21.032 --> 53:23.368
that started to affect the
other aspects of my life.

53:23.410 --> 53:24.743
And I wanna make
this point clear,

53:24.785 --> 53:27.497
it's like being vegetarian
or vegan doesn't

53:27.538 --> 53:30.125
necessarily say that you
are all the way healthy.

53:30.167 --> 53:33.002
You have to find what
the things are to eat

53:33.043 --> 53:34.712
because at one point
when I was vegetarian,

53:34.753 --> 53:37.673
I would just eat french
fries and salads.

53:37.715 --> 53:39.175
And that wasn't really healthy,

53:39.217 --> 53:42.512
so you have to find the things
that are good for your body.

53:42.553 --> 53:44.973
I wish somebody
woulda told me earlier

53:45.015 --> 53:50.020
about becoming a vegan, like
when I was like sixteen.

53:50.062 --> 53:51.772
My health would incredible.

53:51.813 --> 53:54.440
And I can honestly say like
if you run around and work

53:54.482 --> 53:57.527
and stay in the studio
and party as much as I do,

53:57.568 --> 53:59.570
this the only lifestyle for you.

53:59.612 --> 54:00.863
Yeah, your energy's
totally different.

54:00.905 --> 54:02.490
Your brain works different.

54:02.532 --> 54:04.367
You can tell the difference
even if you go to eat a bunch of

54:04.408 --> 54:05.827
Popeye's or you eat
a bunch of grease,

54:05.868 --> 54:07.412
you gonna be so tired
once you get to the house,

54:07.453 --> 54:08.913
or go to work, forget
about it, you get lazy.

54:08.955 --> 54:11.667
But when you eat at
a certain standard,

54:11.708 --> 54:13.042
you know it's even more fun.

54:13.083 --> 54:14.335
It's like you found
somebody who cooks it right

54:14.377 --> 54:16.630
and it's like not oily
an it's not heavy.

54:16.672 --> 54:17.880
- I like coming to this place,

54:17.922 --> 54:20.383
My Two Cents because I
love the energy here.

54:20.425 --> 54:21.927
The food, the people
cook with love.

54:21.968 --> 54:24.512
My Two Cents is in the
community in Los Angeles

54:24.553 --> 54:28.140
where people from the inner
city can have access to it.

54:28.182 --> 54:29.225
And I love this restaurant.

54:29.267 --> 54:30.852
The vibe is right.

54:30.893 --> 54:32.645
- I am chef Alisa Reynolds.

54:32.687 --> 54:34.730
Originally from Los Angeles.

54:34.772 --> 54:37.567
I've done events for
everyone from Barack Obama,

54:37.608 --> 54:41.570
Oprah Winfrey, Common,
Reggie Bush, Matt Kemp.

54:41.612 --> 54:43.238
You know it's an
old Southern saying,

54:43.280 --> 54:45.408
you put your two cents in.

54:45.450 --> 54:46.785
So this is my two cents,

54:46.827 --> 54:49.997
my version of what
traditional American food

54:50.038 --> 54:51.622
from the South is.

54:51.665 --> 54:55.418
I saw the numbers of people
that were dying of diabetes

54:55.460 --> 54:57.878
and obesity and I wanted
to do something different

54:57.920 --> 55:03.092
but I always felt you can't
change someone sharply,

55:03.133 --> 55:04.052
it's a about changing
people's mind

55:04.093 --> 55:06.387
without changing the dish.

55:06.428 --> 55:08.390
It's not trying to
change people instantly,

55:08.432 --> 55:13.437
it's turning them on to
new things and slowly,

55:13.478 --> 55:14.895
it could change people's lives.

55:14.937 --> 55:16.438
See the thing is, you
gotta be able to ease it by

55:16.480 --> 55:17.898
and not tell, you have to
prepare it so that people

55:17.940 --> 55:19.983
can't tell the difference
in it or automatically

55:20.027 --> 55:21.527
your brain just shuts it out.

55:21.568 --> 55:23.780
I had a couple come in,
and he's eating the gumbo

55:23.822 --> 55:25.990
and he's like man, this
sausage is so good.

55:26.032 --> 55:28.033
And his whole family
is around and I'm like,

55:28.075 --> 55:31.705
oh, that's vegan sausage
and he just stopped chewing

55:31.747 --> 55:33.540
and his wife, everybody
started laughing.

55:33.582 --> 55:37.668
And she's like, he's so
against vegetarian anything,

55:37.710 --> 55:39.420
he just assumed
that it was meat.

55:39.462 --> 55:41.338
It's mental, you know?

55:41.380 --> 55:44.508
It's a mental reality that
people just are stuck with

55:44.550 --> 55:46.302
over generations
and generations.

55:46.343 --> 55:49.805
I think it's just getting
the community exposed to it.

55:49.847 --> 55:53.308
Good tasting food that is
has healthy options to it.

55:53.350 --> 55:56.645
If I tried to keep the
tradition that people recognize.

55:56.687 --> 55:59.732
And change the method,
it would change the way

55:59.773 --> 56:02.027
they'd look at it in general.

56:02.068 --> 56:03.360
But I have to tell
them afterwards.

56:03.403 --> 56:05.238
You do it for you
first, you know?

56:05.280 --> 56:06.823
You not doing it
to offend anybody,

56:06.865 --> 56:08.658
you not doing it to
prove to somebody,

56:08.700 --> 56:10.827
like when people be like,
oh are you pescatarian?

56:10.868 --> 56:12.370
I be like, no I just eat fish.

56:12.412 --> 56:14.038
No matter what you call it,

56:14.080 --> 56:17.083
you know what the purpose
that you doing it for.

56:17.125 --> 56:20.043
- I say start now, start slowly,

56:20.087 --> 56:23.005
if it's one day a week
that you try something new.

56:23.047 --> 56:25.800
Don't go home and
eat a pot of rice.

56:25.842 --> 56:27.177
Or a pot of spaghetti.

56:27.218 --> 56:29.387
Eat some salad with that chicken

56:29.428 --> 56:31.680
or with that steak
or with that fish.

56:31.722 --> 56:35.393
Sautéed vegetable, tell your
moms I want vegetables man.

56:35.435 --> 56:36.853
And I just ate
this whole meal.

56:36.895 --> 56:39.855
I don't feel tired,
sleepy or nothing.

56:39.897 --> 56:42.608
I just had soul food and
I'm not over here like this.

56:42.650 --> 56:44.110
I'm ready to go.

56:44.152 --> 56:46.695
Leave here and go to the
studio and get my work on,

56:46.737 --> 56:48.197
so that's what it was for me.

56:48.238 --> 56:51.408
I don't want nothing
that's gonna slow me down.

56:51.450 --> 56:54.078
A friend eats elephant's
ass and he's happy you know?

56:54.120 --> 56:56.957
And good, your friends a unique
person with special genes.

56:56.998 --> 56:59.125
That don't mean, oh, you
could smoke cigarettes,

56:59.167 --> 57:01.043
my dad lived to 100
smoking cigarettes.

57:01.085 --> 57:03.463
Your fucking dad was special.

57:03.505 --> 57:04.297
I don't know what to
tell you, is that what,

57:04.338 --> 57:05.548
what's gonna tell you.

57:05.590 --> 57:08.092
You now if you're doing
well, with a bad diet,

57:08.133 --> 57:09.885
if you're doing well
and you don't work out.

57:09.927 --> 57:11.553
Just think you can do better.

57:11.595 --> 57:13.055
We can all do better.

57:13.097 --> 57:15.057
Since the last interview,
we definitely got better,

57:15.098 --> 57:19.728
Hustle Fit is a real
brand in Houston now.

57:19.770 --> 57:21.898
Everywhere you go,
all around Texas

57:21.940 --> 57:23.900
you could see people
rocking the Hustle Fit brand

57:23.942 --> 57:25.277
and supporting the movement

57:25.318 --> 57:26.777
and being a part
of the movement.

57:26.820 --> 57:29.113
What is Hustle Fit to me,
Hustle Fit is a lifestyle,

57:29.155 --> 57:31.240
we want to always
emphasize the hustle.

57:31.282 --> 57:34.202
We put the hustle in big
and the fit in small letters

57:34.243 --> 57:36.328
so people can realize the
hustle's in everything

57:36.370 --> 57:38.205
you did whether if
it was in the gym,

57:38.247 --> 57:41.125
whether it was at work,
whether it was education-wise,

57:41.167 --> 57:42.752
you going to school,
trying to get that degree,

57:42.793 --> 57:44.087
for college, you know.

57:44.128 --> 57:45.588
Everything you do, you
have to hustle for it.

57:45.630 --> 57:47.798
And what it is, is everyday
you try to be better

57:47.840 --> 57:49.008
than you were yesterday.

57:49.050 --> 57:50.510
Well I can't call
myself a hustler

57:50.552 --> 57:53.428
if I ain't hustling to
take care of myself also.

57:53.470 --> 57:54.597
I think it's 50/50.

57:54.638 --> 57:56.975
I think it's about
taking care of yourself

57:57.017 --> 58:00.270
and after you leave the gym,
go and get on your own hustle

58:00.312 --> 58:03.105
and figure out how to be
successful in this world.

58:03.147 --> 58:04.732
Not a lot of people
that look like me,

58:04.773 --> 58:08.277
make it out and get to see a
different part of the world.

58:08.318 --> 58:10.572
I got some friends that's
still stuck in that circle but,

58:10.613 --> 58:13.240
they see me doing something
that's not selling dope

58:13.282 --> 58:16.452
and I'm not locked up,
I'm not dead or in jail.

58:16.493 --> 58:18.245
And I go back and
I can touch them

58:18.287 --> 58:20.415
and show them where
I'm at and inspire them

58:20.457 --> 58:22.292
to wanna get better
and do better.

58:22.333 --> 58:24.960
And they realize stuff does
exist outside of the hood

58:25.002 --> 58:27.130
and you can make it
doing honest living.

58:27.172 --> 58:29.215
I gave up smoking,
I gave up drinking

58:29.257 --> 58:31.092
and I gave up
cheating on my meal.

58:31.133 --> 58:33.093
You know without all
that, I felt lighter,

58:33.135 --> 58:35.012
I felt like, you know,
I was in a better mood

58:35.053 --> 58:36.847
and I got a lot more stuff done.

58:36.890 --> 58:38.390
- We inspire people.

58:38.432 --> 58:40.643
Whether it's through
social media,

58:40.685 --> 58:43.730
through fitness competitions
that we're doing.

58:43.772 --> 58:45.690
You know the feedback
that we get from people,

58:45.732 --> 58:48.985
hey I've been watching you
guys and you guys motivated me,

58:49.027 --> 58:50.612
I've been down in life,

58:50.653 --> 58:52.322
and it's been hard but
just watching you guys

58:52.363 --> 58:55.783
live your lives day to
day, and really repping it,

58:55.825 --> 58:58.452
it's just giving me hope and
it's pushing me to go forward.

58:58.493 --> 59:00.330
People come up to
me randomly and say,

59:00.372 --> 59:03.290
man we seen how far you
came, we seen how you changed

59:03.332 --> 59:07.378
since back in the day, and it
motivate us to get in the gym

59:07.420 --> 59:09.338
and start working on
ourself and getting better.

59:09.380 --> 59:10.840
What better service can
you do than the service of

59:10.882 --> 59:13.760
someone else helping them
change their lifestyle

59:13.802 --> 59:16.137
and once that happen man
it kinda just took off

59:16.178 --> 59:18.347
and I haven't looked back since.

59:18.388 --> 59:19.473
- It's just like everything,

59:19.515 --> 59:20.892
if you wanna be
successful at anything,

59:20.933 --> 59:24.062
you gotta have the discipline,
you gotta have the drive

59:24.103 --> 59:26.355
and you know it's just about
challenging yourself, man.

59:26.397 --> 59:27.565
- This is not easy.

59:27.607 --> 59:29.025
And it takes a
lot of discipline,

59:29.067 --> 59:30.527
you have to have
self-motivation,

59:30.568 --> 59:32.612
where you have to
establish that mindset,

59:32.653 --> 59:34.530
get around the right people.

59:34.572 --> 59:36.615
Some people that are
going to push you to be

59:36.657 --> 59:39.202
at your best and
the sky's the limit.

59:39.243 --> 59:41.412
Feeling rich is
just being mentally,

59:41.453 --> 59:44.498
spiritually physically,
you know, at your best.

59:44.540 --> 59:45.625
- My thing is this.

59:45.667 --> 59:47.793
You know Fat Joe
your whole life.

59:47.835 --> 59:49.087
Fat Joe.

59:49.128 --> 59:51.672
You known him for
a million years.

59:51.713 --> 59:54.217
If he lost weight,
you can lose weight.

59:54.258 --> 59:56.593
I'm not special in
no way shape or form.

59:56.635 --> 59:58.847
I am not superman.

59:58.888 --> 01:00:00.765
I am just like you.

01:00:00.807 --> 01:00:02.058
If I took you in
the gym right now,

01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:03.893
I would do the
same thing you do.

01:00:03.935 --> 01:00:07.063
There's nothing incredible,
I'm not running up a mountain,

01:00:07.105 --> 01:00:09.940
doing back flips, no I'm
going on the treadmill

01:00:09.982 --> 01:00:12.610
for a little 25
minutes, watching TV.

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:16.905
And you know, I'm done.

01:00:16.947 --> 01:00:18.532
I worked out.

01:00:18.573 --> 01:00:24.163
Since our last interview,
I've lost 50 pounds in total.

01:00:24.205 --> 01:00:25.415
Whoo.

01:00:25.457 --> 01:00:27.083
The benefits to having
a healthier lifestyle

01:00:27.125 --> 01:00:30.795
are that your children are
living a healthier lifestyle.

01:00:30.837 --> 01:00:32.922
We really stay on them
about portion control,

01:00:32.963 --> 01:00:35.800
about vegetables, 'cause we
didn't grow up with that.

01:00:35.842 --> 01:00:37.427
We have diabetes in our family.

01:00:37.468 --> 01:00:39.387
My father passed
away from Cancer.

01:00:39.428 --> 01:00:42.682
We're breaking the cycle
with our children's futures.

01:00:42.723 --> 01:00:44.267
You now, they'll that
along to their kids.

01:00:44.308 --> 01:00:46.435
Maybe they won't have
to suffer from diabetes,

01:00:46.477 --> 01:00:48.478
maybe they'll make
healthier choices.

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:49.980
- I want people to know.

01:00:50.022 --> 01:00:51.773
I don't want them to have
these heath problems, knowing,

01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:53.902
damn man I coulda
stopped this 20 years ago

01:00:53.943 --> 01:00:56.195
if only I woulda just
exercised a little bit more,

01:00:56.237 --> 01:00:58.740
drunk a little bit more water
instead of drinking soda.

01:00:58.782 --> 01:00:59.948
I think that's the thing,

01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:00.950
people don't wanna
change the lifestyle,

01:01:00.992 --> 01:01:02.452
they just wanna look good.

01:01:02.493 --> 01:01:04.078
Well it takes hard
work to look good.

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:05.830
When you go work and
you done working out,

01:01:05.872 --> 01:01:08.123
you might be sore, but
man you gonna feel good,

01:01:08.165 --> 01:01:09.292
on stage too.

01:01:09.333 --> 01:01:10.627
I'm bouncing around,
jumping around,

01:01:10.668 --> 01:01:12.878
doing thing is couldn't
do when I was big.

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:14.380
I'm not out of breath.

01:01:14.422 --> 01:01:16.632
I can still give my all and
give a hell of a performance.

01:01:16.673 --> 01:01:18.802
I know the hard
work it used to take

01:01:18.843 --> 01:01:21.178
into rocking the show.

01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:23.055
And now it's almost
like I'm gliding.

01:01:23.097 --> 01:01:24.515
And I'm laughing.

01:01:24.557 --> 01:01:26.267
Jordan game seven.

01:01:26.308 --> 01:01:27.727
Laughing, I'm mad I'm laughing.

01:01:27.768 --> 01:01:29.228
Ha!

01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:32.190
Turn around whoo, I'm on the
other side like what's up?

01:01:32.232 --> 01:01:35.025
I think entertainers,
especially rappers getting in shape,

01:01:35.067 --> 01:01:37.153
50 Cent, Fat Joe, myself,

01:01:37.195 --> 01:01:38.653
I think definitely
it's gonna provide

01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:41.032
some king of motivation to
somebody when people see that,

01:01:41.073 --> 01:01:43.492
then they can see, okay, well
if he can do it, I can do it.

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:45.537
We could take the
responsibility to say,

01:01:45.578 --> 01:01:47.538
this is my lifestyle
and people start

01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:48.832
gravitating towards it.

01:01:48.873 --> 01:01:50.500
And if they've been
some kind of successful,

01:01:50.542 --> 01:01:52.210
like let's use a Drake
or even a 2 Chainz,

01:01:52.252 --> 01:01:53.585
you look on his
Instagram, he's like,

01:01:53.627 --> 01:01:54.920
look at this Brussels sprouts.

01:01:54.962 --> 01:01:56.380
Look at this, you know.

01:01:56.422 --> 01:01:58.298
He's eating super healthy
and he shows it on his thing.

01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:01.177
You boast and brag to them
about keeping your body right,

01:02:01.218 --> 01:02:03.678
keeping your temple right
the same way we boast

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:09.060
and brag about the jewels,
the cars, the women.

01:02:09.102 --> 01:02:12.688
You can't enjoy none of that
if you're not in good health.

01:02:12.730 --> 01:02:15.357
Maybe everybody's not
going, yo it's cool,

01:02:15.398 --> 01:02:16.900
because they don't
see a dollar in it.

01:02:16.942 --> 01:02:18.318
But it's not about
a dollar in it.

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:19.862
You're your biggest dollar.

01:02:19.903 --> 01:02:22.030
If your health is bad, I don't
care how much money you have.

01:02:22.072 --> 01:02:24.367
If you're in the hospital,
you can't enjoy it.

01:02:24.408 --> 01:02:27.245
I can enjoy $20 in
good health more than

01:02:27.287 --> 01:02:30.122
you could enjoy
$20,000 in bad health.

01:02:30.163 --> 01:02:32.167
Not gonna tell you it's
the easiest thing to do,

01:02:32.208 --> 01:02:35.587
but it's the greatest
thing I've done in my life.

01:02:35.628 --> 01:02:39.048
Now that I lost 100 pounds,
I'm enjoying living.

01:02:39.090 --> 01:02:42.050
Rather than hoping I don't
die because I'm overweight

01:02:42.092 --> 01:02:43.718
and because if the
way I'm eating.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:47.140
I look at my body as something
that I need to allow me

01:02:47.182 --> 01:02:49.933
to be healthy, to be
whole, because my body

01:02:49.975 --> 01:02:53.813
is now no longer a
liability, but an asset.

01:02:53.855 --> 01:02:57.858
So we did my dad's first
interview for this documentary

01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:00.612
he was a little bit overweight
and he had some health habits

01:03:00.653 --> 01:03:04.073
that his doctors had tried
to talk to him about.

01:03:04.115 --> 01:03:07.243
And he wasn't really listening
and every time we tried

01:03:07.285 --> 01:03:09.495
to get him to pay
attention, he would be like,

01:03:09.537 --> 01:03:12.623
okay well let's see if
anything's wrong and every time

01:03:12.665 --> 01:03:15.000
it turned out that there
wasn't anything concrete

01:03:15.042 --> 01:03:17.002
that we could point to
to get him to stop doing

01:03:17.043 --> 01:03:19.755
certain things, eating
certain types of food

01:03:19.797 --> 01:03:22.758
and that sort of
thing, and then, um.

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:27.222
And then out of
nowhere, he had a,

01:03:27.263 --> 01:03:29.432
I'm not sure what you call
it, but like a diabetes attack

01:03:29.473 --> 01:03:34.978
where he went into a coma
and when he woke up from that

01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:37.147
a few days later, the
doctors gave him a warning

01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:39.067
and told him that if
you do any of the things

01:03:39.108 --> 01:03:43.153
we told you not to do, one
more time, that could be it.

01:03:43.195 --> 01:03:45.363
Like this was your,
basically your final warning,

01:03:45.405 --> 01:03:47.700
like this is, should
be a wake-up call.

01:03:47.742 --> 01:03:48.952
And my dad listened.

01:03:48.993 --> 01:03:53.122
Since January 8th
last year 2015,

01:03:53.163 --> 01:03:58.502
I was informed that of
because of my overindulgence

01:03:58.543 --> 01:04:04.467
in sugar or sweet stuff,
that I was 'sposed to die.

01:04:04.508 --> 01:04:07.512
I got that wake-up call
and I took advantage of it.

01:04:07.553 --> 01:04:09.013
And I heard it loud and clear

01:04:09.055 --> 01:04:13.683
and I have not had a drop
of alcohol in 19 months.

01:04:13.725 --> 01:04:18.647
And I feel like 19 years
old, clear as a bell.

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:20.148
I've never been more
creative in my life

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:23.652
and I will never go back,
I do not miss it at all.

01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:25.153
And it's kind of
a testament to like,

01:04:25.195 --> 01:04:28.198
once you start the momentum
of getting healthier

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:30.827
and you realize how
good it feels, you know,

01:04:30.868 --> 01:04:32.495
it's hard to go back.

01:04:32.537 --> 01:04:33.328
- Push now.

01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:34.330
Push, push, push.

01:04:34.372 --> 01:04:35.288
More, more, more, more, more.

01:04:35.330 --> 01:04:36.498
Come on there you go, great job.

01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:38.333
Good job, good job, perfect.

01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:39.835
My wish is that
everybody gets to at least

01:04:39.877 --> 01:04:42.672
feel that feeling so
they know what it is

01:04:42.713 --> 01:04:44.673
so that they can get
hooked on it, you know.

01:04:44.715 --> 01:04:47.677
It's not the worst thing
to be hooked on at all.

01:04:47.718 --> 01:04:50.012
So.

01:04:50.053 --> 01:04:51.597
For me this is one of the
most important documentaries

01:04:51.638 --> 01:04:54.600
I get to be a part of
because healthy living
