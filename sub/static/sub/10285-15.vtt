WEBVTT

00:04.672 --> 00:06.407
Previously on ER:

00:06.440 --> 00:08.141
Are you sending me to live
with Grandma and Grandpa?

00:08.176 --> 00:09.443
GATES:
You fought to keep her.

00:09.477 --> 00:11.079
You're the one who
wanted it like this.

00:11.112 --> 00:12.213
The child's not happy here.

00:12.246 --> 00:13.614
I'll be coming to Chicago soon,

00:13.647 --> 00:14.815
so you be ready.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.317
This shouldn't have
to be this hard.

00:16.350 --> 00:20.121
Eventually, you know
we would end up right back

00:20.154 --> 00:23.291
in the same place, and frankly,
I don't have the time.

00:23.324 --> 00:25.159
Julie's in Nepal.
Well, good.
Then we can

00:25.193 --> 00:27.161
have some time
to get it out of our system.

00:27.195 --> 00:29.197
What good is success when you
have no one to share it with?

00:29.230 --> 00:30.531
You really want
to mentor this kid?

00:30.564 --> 00:32.165
Give me a month.

00:37.405 --> 00:39.173
Hey, Sam, have
you seen Gates?

00:39.207 --> 00:40.408
Uh, who?

00:40.441 --> 00:42.743
Gates? Is he
working today?

00:42.776 --> 00:44.178
How would I know?

00:44.212 --> 00:46.280
Open tib/fib is next up
in the OR.

00:46.314 --> 00:47.581
Oh, and meniscus guy
needs crutches,

00:47.615 --> 00:50.084
and hip lady
can go to the floor.

00:50.118 --> 00:51.552
You look
different.

00:51.585 --> 00:54.288
Discharge Curtain 3,
give him a Vicodin for the road.

00:54.322 --> 00:55.456
Yeah, I'm with Sam.

00:55.489 --> 00:56.624
Something's going
on with you.

00:56.657 --> 00:58.359
Well, I kicked ass
in my overnight.

00:58.392 --> 00:59.793
What can I say?

00:59.827 --> 01:02.796
Hey, I need you to look at
my bike crash guy in Exam 2.

01:02.830 --> 01:04.265
Call Ortho.

01:04.298 --> 01:06.134
I'm looking
at Ortho.
Not anymore.

01:06.134 --> 01:07.435
I'm officially done
with my rotation.

01:07.468 --> 01:09.870
The next time you see me,
I will be back

01:09.903 --> 01:11.339
with General Surgery.

01:11.372 --> 01:12.706
Big plans for
your day off?

01:12.740 --> 01:14.575
Well, it is a big day.

01:14.608 --> 01:16.544
Is it?

01:16.577 --> 01:18.312
What are you doing?

01:18.346 --> 01:19.680
Oh, I'm not sure.

01:19.713 --> 01:21.882
Nothing comes up,
it'll be my couch,

01:21.915 --> 01:25.386
moo goo gai pan and Project
Runway, which is good enough.

01:25.419 --> 01:26.820
You're not caught up?

01:26.854 --> 01:28.456
Oh, it's awesome.

01:28.489 --> 01:29.890
No, don't tell me.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.592
I'm gonna watch
the repeats today.

01:31.625 --> 01:35.429
Cable guy should be arriving
in two to six hours.

01:35.463 --> 01:37.465
You don't have cable?

01:37.498 --> 01:38.666
It went out three weeks ago.

01:38.699 --> 01:39.867
You look nice.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.735
So do you.
We still on for lunch?

01:41.769 --> 01:43.904
It's switch day. You're
supposed to take me out.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.273
Oh, right.

01:45.306 --> 01:47.175
Off to Pedes surgery.

01:47.208 --> 01:49.343
Well, actually, that's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

01:49.377 --> 01:50.544
I promise we'll do it soon.

01:50.578 --> 01:52.680
* Ain't nothing gonna
break my stride *

01:52.713 --> 01:55.216
* Nobody's gonna slow me down

01:55.249 --> 01:57.551
* Oh, no

01:57.585 --> 02:00.221
* I got to keep on moving...

02:02.000 --> 02:08.074

02:09.896 --> 02:11.832
DUBENKO:
Neela?

02:12.933 --> 02:14.868
Neela?

02:16.470 --> 02:18.839
Are you decent?

02:18.872 --> 02:20.808
I'm coming in.

02:22.243 --> 02:24.245
Neela?

02:25.313 --> 02:27.315
What is it?

02:27.348 --> 02:30.284
Well, there was a little mix-up.

02:30.318 --> 02:33.321
Your shift in General Surgery
started 15 minutes ago.

02:35.223 --> 02:36.857
Please, not today.

02:36.890 --> 02:39.293
Come on. Dry off
and put some clothes on.

02:39.327 --> 02:43.231
We've got a nun versus waffle
iron waiting for us in the ER.

02:58.712 --> 03:00.381
Aah! Six-two.

03:00.414 --> 03:02.416
You're getting beat
by an old codger.

03:02.450 --> 03:04.418
Hank, that's
your granddaughter!

03:04.452 --> 03:07.255
It's okay, Grandma.
I'm about to...

03:07.255 --> 03:08.789
Goal!

03:08.822 --> 03:10.824
Oh! I gave you
that one.
Hank, calm down!

03:10.858 --> 03:12.760
I swear, he acts
like a child sometimes.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.728
Keeps him young.

03:14.762 --> 03:16.830
Ah. Sarah seems
very happy.

03:16.864 --> 03:19.400
Yeah, she's with her old
group of friends again,

03:19.433 --> 03:20.868
doing well in school.

03:20.901 --> 03:22.603
Even in math,
which is

03:22.636 --> 03:23.804
almost a miracle.

03:23.837 --> 03:25.606
You've done a good job, Tony.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.375
But wait till she's 16,

03:27.408 --> 03:30.278
starts dating,
ignores everything you say.

03:30.311 --> 03:32.446
Oh, I'm already looking
into boarding schools.

03:34.615 --> 03:36.850
Aha!

03:36.884 --> 03:38.486
Oh!
Game over!

03:38.519 --> 03:40.821
Beat by your grand... pa.

03:40.854 --> 03:41.855
Come on.

03:41.889 --> 03:42.823
Best two out of three.

03:42.856 --> 03:44.392
Grandpa?

03:44.425 --> 03:45.559
MAN:
White meat is better!

03:45.593 --> 03:46.927
MAN 2:
Says who?
FDA.

03:46.960 --> 03:47.961
Ever heard of them?

03:47.995 --> 03:49.697
Jump in,
Dr. Pratt.

03:49.730 --> 03:50.998
Start with a
cleansing breath.

03:51.031 --> 03:52.600
(inhales
and exhales)

03:52.633 --> 03:54.602
All right, look, let's
just try to relax, okay?

03:54.635 --> 03:56.537
Names, Dr. Pratt.
Use names.

03:56.570 --> 03:59.407
All right. Look, Ted, Jim,
let's just figure out a way...

03:59.440 --> 04:00.674
My name's not Jim.

04:00.708 --> 04:02.576
Don't call me Jim.
He's Jack Sprat.

04:02.610 --> 04:04.345
He eats no fat.

04:04.378 --> 04:05.413
That's the exercise.

04:05.446 --> 04:07.415
Help Mr. Sprat

04:07.448 --> 04:09.350
reframe his position
using "I" statements.

04:09.383 --> 04:10.884
"I" statements?

04:10.918 --> 04:13.687
Mm-hmm. I prefer white meat
because it's healthier.

04:13.721 --> 04:17.024
I prefer dark meat
because it tastes better.

04:17.057 --> 04:18.526
Okay, look,
Mr. Spratt...

04:18.559 --> 04:20.428
I think I should
be Mr. Sprat.

04:20.461 --> 04:22.363
No way. I've committed
to this role.

04:22.396 --> 04:24.398
Really? Sounds like
you're phoning it in.
Oh, excuse me,

04:24.432 --> 04:25.566
Mr. De Niro.

04:25.599 --> 04:26.567
This isn't working.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.001
Are you talking to me?

04:28.035 --> 04:29.337
You talkin' to me?

04:29.370 --> 04:31.872
Of course I'm talking to you!

04:31.905 --> 04:33.541
FRANK:
What's your problem?

04:33.574 --> 04:34.742
Oop! I warned you!
(gasps)

04:34.775 --> 04:36.944
No food in the
patient care area.

04:36.977 --> 04:38.746
Hostile work environment!
Hostile work environment!

04:38.779 --> 04:40.914
Oh, guys, stop it. I can't
even hear myself think.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.716
Did you see
what he just did?

04:42.750 --> 04:44.352
It's a JCAHO violation
to have food in the desk area.

04:44.352 --> 04:45.953
Come on, Pratt.
Help a brother out.

04:45.986 --> 04:48.589
Okay, show me
a brother.

04:48.622 --> 04:49.957
Hey, how was Chief Camp?

04:49.990 --> 04:51.392
Chief Camp?

04:51.425 --> 04:53.594
Oh, did you get a medal,
wear a badge?

04:53.627 --> 04:55.363
No, Frank, it was a
management seminar.

04:55.396 --> 04:56.664
Thank you,
Morris.
Ooh.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.599
Mr. Yanai got kicked
out of his band,

04:58.632 --> 05:00.067
because he said his blood
pressure medication

05:00.100 --> 05:01.435
is making him
tone-deaf.

05:01.469 --> 05:02.970
You ever hear
of that?

05:03.003 --> 05:04.772
No. He should discuss it
with his cardiologist.
Oh.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.740
And I accessed the port
for a breast cancer patient.

05:06.774 --> 05:08.476
A line is
impossible to flush.

05:08.509 --> 05:10.378
Yeah. Have Interventional
Radiology take a look.

05:10.378 --> 05:11.879
Okay. You want a
chest X ray first?

05:11.912 --> 05:13.447
No, have IR deal with it.

05:13.481 --> 05:14.948
They're the ones
who put it in.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.617
That's easy.
Oh, Frank!

05:16.650 --> 05:17.985
You shouldn't have.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.387
No. They're for Sam.

05:19.387 --> 05:20.588
What?

05:20.621 --> 05:21.789
"What a beautiful..."

05:21.822 --> 05:23.391
Excuse me!

05:23.391 --> 05:26.660
Sam, you little...
little minx.

05:26.694 --> 05:28.095
Who are they from?

05:28.128 --> 05:31.399
Um, uh, the, uh,
lady with the kid

05:31.432 --> 05:32.800
who had that fistful
of splinters.

05:32.833 --> 05:33.934
Red roses from a woman?

05:33.967 --> 05:35.035
You're lying.
She's lying.

05:35.068 --> 05:36.804
County General.
Go ahead.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.038
Spill it.
Who are the flowers from?

05:38.071 --> 05:39.407
I'm never
telling you. Okay.

05:39.440 --> 05:40.774
I tell you things
about my love life.

05:40.808 --> 05:42.142
Okay, we'll be ready.
Margo.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.812
Sounded like a howler monkey
in bed.
Got it.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.480
Uh, we got a trauma
coming in.

05:46.514 --> 05:48.081
Why don't you make
yourself useful?

05:48.115 --> 05:49.917
It's bed sores guy
from last week, isn't it?

05:49.950 --> 05:51.952
I saw him giving you
that toothy grin.

05:51.985 --> 05:53.587
Hey! I thought
you were leaving.

05:53.621 --> 05:55.889
Scheduling mix-up. So
much for my big day off.

05:55.923 --> 05:57.658
Hey, pretty flowers.

05:57.691 --> 05:58.759
Oh, th-thank you.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.060
New boyfriend?

06:00.093 --> 06:01.662
No.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.897
Hey, Frank, what's
the date today?

06:03.931 --> 06:05.699
April 17.
Already?

06:05.733 --> 06:07.100
Did you pay your taxes,

06:07.134 --> 06:08.769
or are you exempt
because you're from

06:08.802 --> 06:10.103
(British accent):
across the pond?

06:10.137 --> 06:11.805
Don't do that.
Is this from Abby?

06:11.839 --> 06:13.807
Yeah, I kept bugging her
for a picture.

06:13.841 --> 06:15.543
Oh, my God, he's
getting so big.

06:15.576 --> 06:16.777
You should get
one of those.

06:16.810 --> 06:19.480
A husband or a baby?
Yeah.

06:19.513 --> 06:20.748
MORRIS:
Neela, over here.

06:20.781 --> 06:22.450
What you got?

06:22.483 --> 06:23.684
You're still here?

06:23.717 --> 06:25.052
Yeah. Don't
remind me.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.454
Sheryl Hawkins,
restrained driver,

06:26.487 --> 06:28.188
high-speed MVC.
Car rolled three times.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.690
Tachy to 120s,
sat 98.

06:29.723 --> 06:30.791
Got five of MS
en route.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.125
Positive
seat belt sign.

06:32.159 --> 06:33.461
Does this mean
we can have lunch?

06:33.494 --> 06:34.728
Hi, Sheryl. I'm Dr. Rasgotra.

06:34.762 --> 06:36.697
Do we need
to call anyone for you?

06:36.730 --> 06:38.866
My husband. He'll have to
pick up our kids after school.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.534
Phone number's
in my notes.

06:40.568 --> 06:42.903
It's meatloaf day
at the cafeteria.

06:42.936 --> 06:44.738
Call her husband
and meet us back in there. Go.

06:44.772 --> 06:45.906
118/72.

06:45.939 --> 06:49.076
Got a small
forehead lac.

06:49.109 --> 06:50.911
How long you been
on the 42s?

06:50.944 --> 06:52.212
Uh, it'll be a year
in May.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.214
Hey, is Lou Honeycutt
still there?

06:54.247 --> 06:56.083
Tony, let him
do his job.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.785
Nah.

06:57.818 --> 06:58.952
What is this?
EKG leads, sir.

06:58.986 --> 07:00.120
No, I don't need that.

07:00.153 --> 07:01.522
Hank, we got
to monitor your heart

07:01.555 --> 07:02.690
on the way to the hospital.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.057
I'm not going
to the hospital.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.493
You fainted,
Grandpa.

07:05.526 --> 07:06.694
I lost my balance.

07:06.727 --> 07:08.228
Sir, you could have
a serious condition

07:08.261 --> 07:10.063
that could lead to your heart
completely shutting down.

07:10.097 --> 07:11.198
I skipped breakfast.

07:11.231 --> 07:12.733
All I need is some food.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.068
Well, he's got a strong pulse.

07:15.102 --> 07:18.071
Blood pressure's good,
normal neuro exam.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.007
Are we going in
or not?

07:26.213 --> 07:28.549
You ever send
a woman roses?

07:28.582 --> 07:30.217
Only if it's serious.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.919
Is it serious?

07:31.952 --> 07:33.554
No.

07:33.587 --> 07:35.656
Well, either he's trying
to get you into bed, or...

07:35.689 --> 07:36.657
Uh...

07:36.690 --> 07:38.659
He already got you
into bed,

07:38.692 --> 07:40.994
and he thinks
you need the reassurance

07:41.028 --> 07:42.996
that it wasn't just
a one-night stand.

07:43.030 --> 07:44.665
Okay. That's
what I thought.

07:44.698 --> 07:45.999
(chuckles)

07:46.033 --> 07:47.901
Hold up. I'll be right back.

07:47.935 --> 07:50.103
Hey!

07:50.137 --> 07:51.138
Hey.

07:51.171 --> 07:52.740
I've been
calling you.

07:52.773 --> 07:55.175
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Things have been a little crazy.

07:55.208 --> 07:56.944
I left you a bunch
of messages.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.779
Is everything
all right?
Mm, just work.

07:58.812 --> 08:01.114
Look, I'm running late,
and I'm, uh, guessing you should

08:01.148 --> 08:03.016
be inside saving lives.

08:03.050 --> 08:04.552
I'm waiting on
a paramedic run.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.720
There you go.

08:06.754 --> 08:09.590
Hey, look, you want to grab
some coffee later, or...?

08:09.623 --> 08:11.559
I'm sorry. I have to go.

08:13.126 --> 08:14.962
(sighs)

08:14.995 --> 08:18.098
I was running late
for my art history class at UIC

08:18.131 --> 08:19.767
when this guy cut me off.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.770
You're a
professor?

08:22.803 --> 08:24.171
(laughs)
Freshman.

08:24.204 --> 08:26.206
(laughs)

08:26.239 --> 08:28.141
College is a little difficult

08:28.175 --> 08:30.844
when you're pregnant
right out of high school.

08:30.878 --> 08:32.613
(groans)

08:32.645 --> 08:34.313
Four kids, 23 years later...

08:34.347 --> 08:35.616
(laughs)

08:35.649 --> 08:36.817
...here... Ugh!... Here I am.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.885
Your children must be proud.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.020
(laughs)

08:40.053 --> 08:41.020
Yeah.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.022
(groans softly)

08:42.054 --> 08:43.724
My son Chris is a sophomore.

08:43.756 --> 08:45.125
He loves the fact

08:45.158 --> 08:48.295
that his mother's... fresh...

08:48.328 --> 08:50.130
Sheryl,
everything okay?
...man.

08:51.098 --> 08:52.265
A little woozy.

08:52.299 --> 08:54.134
What's wrong?

08:54.167 --> 08:56.036
She's tachy with
a dropping crit,

08:56.069 --> 08:57.304
and we're standing
around chatting.

08:57.337 --> 08:59.006
HAROLD:
112. It's not
that bad.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.775
Well, it's too fast,
considering she's so calm.

09:01.809 --> 09:03.143
I did that
five minutes ago.

09:03.176 --> 09:04.311
Ultrasound was fine.

09:04.344 --> 09:06.013
The aorta seems

09:06.046 --> 09:08.048
a little wide,
doesn't it?

09:08.081 --> 09:09.349
You're hallucinating.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.851
See for yourself.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.119
Where?

09:12.152 --> 09:13.286
Okay, you were up

09:13.320 --> 09:15.288
all night, you start
imagining things.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.895
Uh, it's subtle,
but it's there.

09:21.929 --> 09:23.330
(sighs)

09:23.363 --> 09:25.165
With an aortic rupture,
she'd be dead already,

09:25.198 --> 09:26.700
but if it's
a dissection

09:26.734 --> 09:28.101
with a
slow leak...
Dead?

09:28.135 --> 09:32.239
Uh, don't listen to her.

09:32.272 --> 09:34.274
Sorry. I didn't mean to...

09:34.307 --> 09:36.043
Morris,
they need you in 2.

09:39.046 --> 09:40.047
(sighs)

09:40.080 --> 09:41.782
Okay, she's stable.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.984
Lily will stay
and monitor her.

09:44.017 --> 09:45.819
Oh, you, grab
a cup of coffee

09:45.853 --> 09:47.120
or a nap
or something.

09:47.154 --> 09:48.956
Abdominal CT
with a contrast right now.

09:48.989 --> 09:51.358
If they make you wait
more than a half an hour,

09:51.391 --> 09:53.827
bring her straight to the OR.

09:54.995 --> 09:57.364
Hey, are you okay?

09:57.397 --> 09:59.667
Something's not right.

10:02.135 --> 10:03.771
What the hell?

10:03.804 --> 10:06.039
Oh, I read a study in where
smelling one's breath

10:06.073 --> 10:08.408
you can tell what's
missing in their diet.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.377
Well, stop it.

10:10.410 --> 10:12.713
Make sure they're getting
serial crits on her.

10:12.746 --> 10:15.048
And then maybe
we can go get

10:15.082 --> 10:16.850
a coffee?
Why so persistent?

10:16.884 --> 10:18.385
No reason.
Neela?

10:18.418 --> 10:20.253
We need you
for a trauma consult in here.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.022
And check coags, too.

10:22.055 --> 10:23.023
And... stop hitting on me.

10:23.056 --> 10:24.157
I don't need any oxygen.

10:24.191 --> 10:25.158
MORRIS:
It's just a precaution.

10:25.192 --> 10:26.760
Hank,
for God's sake.

10:26.794 --> 10:28.796
Hank, you're making this
harder on everyone.

10:28.829 --> 10:29.963
RASGOTRA:
Tony, I thought you were off?

10:29.997 --> 10:31.231
This is Sarah's grandfather.

10:31.264 --> 10:32.766
We're spending
the day together.

10:32.800 --> 10:35.402
Pulse ox 98.

10:40.273 --> 10:43.176
Fix her.
Sometimes you can't

10:43.210 --> 10:44.778
fix people if they're...

10:44.812 --> 10:46.980
Shut up! Go away!

10:47.014 --> 10:48.281
Why are you even here?

10:48.315 --> 10:49.382
We don't want you here!

10:49.416 --> 10:51.051
She doesn't want you here!

10:51.084 --> 10:53.420
We don't want you!

11:06.199 --> 11:08.168
Hello, sir.
I'm Dr. Rasgotra from Surgery.

11:16.209 --> 11:17.244
HANK: Ow.
TAGGART:
I'm sorry.
It's the last one.

11:17.277 --> 11:18.979
Looks like
A fib at 130.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.081
Okay, there's an electrical
problem in the heart.

11:21.114 --> 11:22.950
Causing a fast,
irregular pulse.

11:22.983 --> 11:24.284
You said his pulse
was normal.

11:24.317 --> 11:26.286
It's possible to go
in and out of A fib.

11:26.319 --> 11:28.488
We'll give medicine
to slow down the heart,

11:28.521 --> 11:30.791
and we'll thin the blood
to reduce the risk of stroke.

11:30.824 --> 11:32.292
TAGGART:
20 of Dilt?
Yeah.

11:32.325 --> 11:35.328
Neela, pressure's
dropping in here.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.297
Go.

11:39.767 --> 11:41.769
The head trauma was minor.

11:41.769 --> 11:43.070
All the problems
seem to be cardiac.

11:43.103 --> 11:44.371
Thank you for
your help, dear.

11:44.404 --> 11:45.939
HANK:
Once you give me the medicine,

11:45.973 --> 11:47.941
I can go home?
Well, in a day or two.

11:47.975 --> 11:50.177
We've got to make sure
you didn't have a heart attack.

11:54.882 --> 11:56.784
Sarah...

11:56.784 --> 11:58.318
Look, this
is very common.

11:58.351 --> 12:00.087
There are some good treatments
that'll fix him right up.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.222
My friend Cathy's uncle died
from a heart attack.

12:02.255 --> 12:03.891
I know this looks scary,

12:03.924 --> 12:05.425
but we're going to be
extra careful, okay?

12:06.526 --> 12:08.829
Okay?
Okay.

12:08.862 --> 12:10.463
6,000 heparin.
MORRIS:
Start a drip

12:10.497 --> 12:12.399
at 1,400 an hour.
Heart rate's at 80.

12:12.432 --> 12:14.301
Pressure's good.
You feeling better, Hank?
I guess so.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.136
I'm going to order
a tele bed, all right?

12:16.169 --> 12:18.105
X rays for Martin Senula.

12:18.138 --> 12:19.339
This is Hank Riley.

12:19.372 --> 12:22.142
Sorry.

12:22.175 --> 12:24.477
I got it.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.947
Troponin's cooking.
Thanks, Sam.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.115
You get a special delivery?

12:28.148 --> 12:30.117
No. Uh, yes.

12:30.150 --> 12:31.551
Thank you.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.086
PRATT:
You want to go ahead

12:33.120 --> 12:34.888
and open your mouth for me?

12:35.956 --> 12:36.824
Okay, good.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.926
Now close.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.828
Plain films.
You can go ahead
and open your eyes.

12:40.861 --> 12:42.963
No film.

12:42.996 --> 12:44.297
I have a digital camera.

12:46.066 --> 12:47.835
His head CT was normal.

12:47.868 --> 12:49.502
Come on. Let's go check
and see if those labs are back.

12:49.536 --> 12:50.904
Sit tight, Mr. Senula.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.305
SENULA:
I'd rather lie down.

12:52.339 --> 12:53.540
You think he's got
a bad concussion?

12:53.573 --> 12:56.977
Fractured radius and ulna.

12:57.010 --> 12:58.478
Humeral head, too.

12:58.511 --> 13:00.447
Yeah, look at this.

13:00.480 --> 13:01.849
And compression fractures
of T-12, L-4 and 5,

13:01.882 --> 13:03.316
all in different
stages of healing.

13:03.350 --> 13:04.517
That's never good.

13:04.551 --> 13:06.219
(sighs)

13:06.253 --> 13:07.587
Your signature, please.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.890
What is this?

13:09.923 --> 13:11.324
I'm filing a grievance

13:11.358 --> 13:13.460
against Dr. Morris
and his aftershave.

13:13.493 --> 13:14.995
What's with you two?

13:15.028 --> 13:16.363
TAGGART:
I think it's love.

13:16.396 --> 13:18.398
Have you smelled him?

13:18.431 --> 13:20.033
He's like a violation
of the Clean Air Act.

13:20.067 --> 13:21.568
People in glass houses, Frank.

13:21.601 --> 13:23.236
Hey, did you get my labs
back on Exam 2?

13:23.270 --> 13:25.572
The Chem 20 machine
is down for an hour.

13:25.605 --> 13:27.407
The Radiology attending
wants you to call

13:27.440 --> 13:28.909
about the MRI in 3.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.944
Betina?
Some guy named Cohen.

13:30.978 --> 13:33.013
Your squeeze isn't
working today.

13:33.046 --> 13:34.915
I saw her walk in.

13:34.948 --> 13:36.249
And don't say
"squeeze," Frank.

13:36.283 --> 13:38.051
Fine, so shoot
the messenger.

13:38.085 --> 13:41.021
Oh, and that kid's been
loitering for a good hour.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.890
The son of your
broken bone guy.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.591
Thanks.
I got it.

13:44.624 --> 13:46.994
Oh, and another thing--
the Golden Boy called.

13:47.027 --> 13:48.328
His connecting flight
was cancelled.

13:48.361 --> 13:50.130
He won't be in
until tonight.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.631
Brenner? I thought he was
at a conference in South Bend.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.935
Oh, yeah, if by conference,
you mean "fashion show,"

13:54.968 --> 13:56.236
and by "South Bend,"
you mean Milan.

13:56.269 --> 13:57.404
I'm Dr. Pratt.

13:57.437 --> 13:59.206
Nick. How's my dad?

13:59.239 --> 14:02.109
Well, he's got multiple
fractures and a broken back.

14:02.142 --> 14:03.911
That's pretty bad.

14:03.911 --> 14:05.312
Is your mom around?

14:05.345 --> 14:07.547
No, it's just the two of us.

14:07.580 --> 14:10.550
Okay, well, do you have
any relatives that live nearby?

14:10.583 --> 14:13.386
My aunt.
Do you mind
if we give her a call?

14:13.420 --> 14:15.923
Um, I don't have her number
on me, so...

14:15.956 --> 14:18.358
Can you get it?

14:18.391 --> 14:19.927
Come on. We'll walk you over.

14:21.161 --> 14:22.429
Do you know
of anyone who might

14:22.462 --> 14:24.932
want to hurt your dad?

14:24.965 --> 14:26.499
Um, no.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.936
He ever talk about
anybody bothering him?

14:28.936 --> 14:30.270
Like at work maybe?

14:30.303 --> 14:32.239
He lost his job
about a month ago.

14:32.272 --> 14:33.473
What about drugs?

14:33.506 --> 14:35.275
What?

14:35.308 --> 14:37.210
Well, his injuries are
consistent with violence.

14:37.244 --> 14:38.678
Like somebody's
been hitting him.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.547
If he owed somebody
some money, it...

14:40.580 --> 14:42.082
My dad's not like that.

14:42.115 --> 14:44.051
Can I see him now?

14:44.084 --> 14:45.152
We're trying
to help you.

14:45.185 --> 14:46.519
Yeah, I'm sure you are.

14:46.553 --> 14:49.022
Do you know
who called 911?

14:49.056 --> 14:50.958
I don't know.
I was at school.

14:50.958 --> 14:53.126
So everything was fine
this morning before you left?

14:53.160 --> 14:54.494
Yeah, fine.

14:54.527 --> 14:55.963
He was fine and now
his arms are all busted.

14:55.996 --> 14:57.564
Okay, I-I don't
get it either.

15:01.634 --> 15:03.370
Go right in.
He's in there.

15:09.009 --> 15:11.078
We never said anything

15:11.111 --> 15:13.046
about his dad's arms
being broken.

15:15.048 --> 15:16.283
TIFFANY:
Dr. Gates.

15:16.316 --> 15:17.684
(Hank vomits)
I hung a second liter.

15:17.717 --> 15:19.419
I need an order for reglan.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.288
GATES:
All right, start with ten.
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

15:21.321 --> 15:22.455
Take it easy, Hank.

15:22.489 --> 15:23.590
Belly pain?
All over.

15:23.623 --> 15:25.158
Okay, open up the saline.

15:25.192 --> 15:27.194
He needs an abdominal
CT with contrast.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.996
What's going on?
It's possible that
your grandfather...

15:29.029 --> 15:30.597
Dr. Morris,
what's happening?

15:30.630 --> 15:32.632
Well, with A fib, you can get
a blood clot in the heart.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.467
Now, a piece can
break off and travel

15:34.501 --> 15:36.636
down to the belly, blocking the
blood supply to his intestines.

15:36.669 --> 15:38.271
(groans)

15:38.305 --> 15:40.207
HANK:
I need something.
Four of morphine.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.641
No, we should start with two.
Pressure's borderline.

15:41.674 --> 15:43.510
Once we open up the fluids...

15:43.543 --> 15:45.645
Tony, listen
to the doctor.
Get him on a
portable monitor.

15:45.678 --> 15:48.615
I want him in the scanner
in five minutes. Let's go!

15:48.648 --> 15:51.584
Don't worry, sweetie.
Mommy's going to be fine.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.586
I'll see you when I wake up.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.289
Bye. I love you.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.491
Thank you.

15:58.525 --> 16:01.128
I really needed
to hear their voices.

16:02.529 --> 16:04.464
Lucy, my five-year-old,
is very worried.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.599
You also have
a five-year-old?

16:06.633 --> 16:09.069
She was a surprise.

16:09.102 --> 16:11.271
A great surprise,
but a surprise.

16:11.304 --> 16:14.207
Well, Lucy has nothing
to worry about.

16:14.241 --> 16:17.210
You're getting the best surgeon
County has to offer.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.385
Someone thinks
very highly of herself.

16:25.418 --> 16:26.786
I was referring to you.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.555
Scrub in.
You're first assistant.

16:28.588 --> 16:31.224
I've been awake
for over 30 hours.

16:31.258 --> 16:33.126
I'll let you do
the aortic repair yourself.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.062
How many residents
get that opportunity?

16:35.062 --> 16:37.330
None. Neela, you have to do it.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.436
Sweet!

16:43.470 --> 16:45.338
What a great way to spend
our last case together.

16:45.372 --> 16:47.374
You're going to Pedes surgery.

16:47.407 --> 16:48.441
I'll still see you.

16:54.081 --> 16:56.383
Actually,
I'm going to Pedes ICU.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.120
What?

17:00.153 --> 17:03.290
You're doing
a non-surgical rotation?

17:03.323 --> 17:05.358
Yeah, that's something
I wanted to talk...

17:05.392 --> 17:07.493
You're going to spend
the whole month dialing dopamine

17:07.527 --> 17:09.462
and weighing diapers.
You're letting him do this?

17:09.496 --> 17:11.531
It's his call.

17:11.564 --> 17:14.134
Well, that's crap.
You had to sign off.

17:14.166 --> 17:15.568
Neela, I...
You only have five years here.

17:15.602 --> 17:18.137
You need to make
every month count.

17:18.171 --> 17:19.571
You know I'm right.

17:19.606 --> 17:22.775
Okay, let's talk
about this later.

17:22.809 --> 17:24.444
We'll see you inside.

17:26.779 --> 17:28.848
(continues scrubbing)

17:28.881 --> 17:30.550
Have you seen my case
of Groovitas?

17:30.583 --> 17:32.285
I don't know. Ask Frank.

17:32.319 --> 17:34.521
No, that's exactly
what he wants me to do.

17:34.554 --> 17:35.722
Morris, I thought we agreed.

17:35.755 --> 17:36.789
No food on the floor.

17:36.823 --> 17:38.158
No, Groovitas is not food.

17:38.191 --> 17:40.527
It's a... liquid life force.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.296
I have my first can
at the start of my shift.

17:43.330 --> 17:45.598
The second one
midway through my shift.

17:45.632 --> 17:47.434
(sighing)

17:47.467 --> 17:49.136
I can't do this.

17:49.169 --> 17:51.238
I can't. I can't work
under these conditions.

17:52.605 --> 17:54.807
That's it.
This is war.

17:54.841 --> 17:56.709
(chuckles)

17:56.743 --> 17:58.811
And what great war
wasn't fought with tape?

17:58.845 --> 18:01.548
Look, I don't know, all right?
Maybe you misdialed.
I called

18:01.581 --> 18:03.150
twice and both times
it was wrong.

18:03.183 --> 18:04.251
So do you have
an aunt or not?

18:04.284 --> 18:05.818
Look, all you're doing...

18:05.852 --> 18:07.620
okay, all you're doing is
asking stupid questions.

18:07.654 --> 18:09.522
So fix him up
and let us go home!

18:09.556 --> 18:11.224
That's not going
to happen anytime soon.

18:11.258 --> 18:13.393
His X rays show that
he's been repeatedly beaten.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.595
We need to figure out
who's doing this to him.
You don't know what

18:15.628 --> 18:17.564
you're talking
about, do you?!
When you fight with your dad,

18:17.597 --> 18:19.799
does it get physical?
Sam...

18:19.832 --> 18:22.802
Do you lose your temper?
Sometimes throw punches?
No, we don't fight.

18:22.835 --> 18:24.471
Come on now.
It's you that's
hurting your dad,

18:24.504 --> 18:25.772
isn't it?

18:26.773 --> 18:28.175
Stupid bitch!

18:30.943 --> 18:32.612
Hey! What the hell was that?

18:32.645 --> 18:33.913
I'm just doing my job.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.283
By berating the kid
in the middle of the ER?

18:36.316 --> 18:38.351
Well, obviously,
something's going on.

18:38.385 --> 18:39.552
I'm trying to figure out
what the real story is.

18:39.586 --> 18:40.820
Sam, you do not
get to storm

18:40.853 --> 18:42.455
into the hallway
making accusations.

18:42.489 --> 18:44.591
If you have a problem,
you discuss it calmly.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.426
Or better yet,
just run it by me first.

18:46.459 --> 18:47.760
Well, somebody has
to take the initiative.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.529
And what's that
supposed to mean?

18:49.562 --> 18:51.764
That means while you've moved on
to the next patient,

18:51.798 --> 18:53.533
I'm the one
who's in the trenches.

18:53.566 --> 18:54.901
I have to deal
with the family.

18:54.934 --> 18:56.436
I have to follow up for us

18:56.469 --> 18:57.570
to make sure
we didn't miss anything.

18:57.604 --> 18:59.472
And right now, I'm the only one

18:59.506 --> 19:01.208
who's trying to figure out
what's wrong with this guy.

19:03.710 --> 19:05.778
You learn that
in Chief Camp?

19:05.812 --> 19:07.914
Might want to ask
for your money back.

19:11.551 --> 19:13.353
All right, everybody,
back to work.

19:35.242 --> 19:37.310
Mind if I sit down?

19:44.384 --> 19:46.353
First of all,

19:46.386 --> 19:49.922
Nurse Taggart-- she had
no right to accuse you.

19:49.956 --> 19:52.692
She overstepped her bounds,
and I'm sorry.

19:52.725 --> 19:56.963
But some of what you told us
just doesn't add up.

19:56.996 --> 20:00.400
Look, the last thing
any of us want

20:00.433 --> 20:02.669
is for your dad
to come back here in a month

20:02.702 --> 20:04.937
with more broken bones.

20:04.971 --> 20:06.906
Now, if you know of anyone
who could have done this...

20:06.939 --> 20:08.207
Look, no one hit him.

20:10.477 --> 20:13.413
And you know that for a fact?

20:13.446 --> 20:14.681
Yeah.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.283
He fell in the kitchen.

20:16.316 --> 20:18.285
All right,
I-I'm the one who called 911.

20:18.318 --> 20:20.320
Paramedics said
it was an anonymous call.

20:20.353 --> 20:22.989
Yeah, well,
I disguised my voice.

20:23.022 --> 20:24.291
Tried to sound older.

20:24.324 --> 20:27.294
Why would you do that?

20:28.995 --> 20:32.565
Okay, about two years ago,
my dad was in a car accident,

20:32.599 --> 20:38.305
and they made me stay
with a foster family.

20:38.338 --> 20:40.407
I'm not going
through that again.

20:40.440 --> 20:43.610
So there's no aunt?

20:43.643 --> 20:45.445
I was hoping if you thought
I had someone to stay with,

20:45.478 --> 20:47.447
you'd just leave me alone.

20:49.549 --> 20:52.485
And you say your dad was just
standing there and then he fell?

20:52.519 --> 20:53.853
Yeah.

20:53.886 --> 20:55.522
Come on, man. You got
to give me something more.

20:55.555 --> 20:58.491
Look, I don't know,
all right?

21:03.062 --> 21:05.932
I guess he has been acting
kind of weird lately.

21:07.400 --> 21:10.537
He's fallen a couple times.

21:10.570 --> 21:13.806
Today was definitely the worst.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.408
Like, he was just,

21:15.442 --> 21:17.477
he was making a sandwich
in the kitchen.

21:17.510 --> 21:18.978
I hear a thud.

21:19.011 --> 21:23.650
I look over and...
he's on the floor.

21:26.753 --> 21:28.721
Just let me run
a few more tests

21:28.755 --> 21:30.990
and see
what I can come up with.

21:32.124 --> 21:34.494
Hey, wait a second.

21:34.527 --> 21:36.763
You're not going to snitch me
out to Social Services, are you?

21:36.796 --> 21:38.064
Let's just see
what I can figure out

21:38.097 --> 21:40.467
about your dad
first, okay?

21:44.471 --> 21:45.705
You had to tube him?

21:45.738 --> 21:46.873
He dropped his sats
in Radiology.

21:46.906 --> 21:48.608
What are you talking
about-- "tubed"?

21:48.641 --> 21:50.610
We're helping your husband
breathe, ma'am.

21:50.643 --> 21:51.844
They read the scan?

21:51.878 --> 21:52.879
Big clot
in the SMA.

21:52.912 --> 21:54.381
Hank... Hank.

21:54.381 --> 21:56.516
No, we had to sedate
him for the CT.

21:56.549 --> 21:58.551
The, uh, the scan shows

21:58.585 --> 22:00.920
a large clot blocking the
main artery to his intestines.

22:00.953 --> 22:02.589
So what do you
need to do?

22:02.622 --> 22:05.091
Well, we need to
open up that artery.
Dr. Morris?

22:05.124 --> 22:07.394
Well, we need to restore
blood flow to his bowels,

22:07.394 --> 22:09.396
and that means surgery.

22:09.396 --> 22:10.397
Surgery?
Today?

22:10.397 --> 22:11.498
No, no, not
necessarily.

22:11.531 --> 22:13.500
What about TPA?

22:13.533 --> 22:14.934
No, I don't, I don't think
that's the best option here.

22:14.967 --> 22:16.536
What's TPA?

22:16.569 --> 22:18.505
It's a clot-
busting medicine

22:18.538 --> 22:19.839
that could help.

22:19.872 --> 22:21.474
But if it doesn't,
we've delayed

22:21.508 --> 22:23.443
an inevitable
operation.

22:23.476 --> 22:25.011
Yeah, that could cause
a stroke or MI.

22:26.513 --> 22:29.682
Surgery is the
best option here.

22:29.716 --> 22:32.051
If that's what you think.

22:32.084 --> 22:34.053
Page Neela.
All right, I want
a hematology consult, too.

22:34.086 --> 22:35.788
You are wasting time.

22:35.822 --> 22:37.056
Not if it prevents
an intracar...

22:37.089 --> 22:40.026
Stop it.
Just stop.

22:40.059 --> 22:42.495
I want coags, serial crits,
and neurovascular checks q hour.

22:42.529 --> 22:43.496
Got it.

22:43.530 --> 22:44.831
And stay on top of the vent.

22:44.864 --> 22:46.799
Acidosis is the last thing
she needs right now.

22:46.833 --> 22:47.767
Got it.

22:47.800 --> 22:49.502
Why the neurovascular checks?

22:49.536 --> 22:50.570
To make sure she's
perfusing her extremities

22:50.603 --> 22:52.439
distal to the graft.

22:52.472 --> 22:54.441
I still haven't forgotten
what you said about pedes.

22:54.474 --> 22:56.509
I'll talk to Lucien
as soon as he gets back.

22:56.543 --> 22:57.544
Look, that's really
not necessary.
He can't exile you

22:57.577 --> 22:58.978
to the pedes ward.

22:59.011 --> 23:01.013
What's he trying to do--
sabotage your career?

23:01.047 --> 23:02.949
He's not trying to sa...
You need ten months
of surgical electives.

23:02.982 --> 23:05.452
There isn't time
to fool around in the PICU.
It's okay.

23:05.452 --> 23:07.820
No, it's not.

23:07.854 --> 23:09.722
You know,
you won't graduate on time

23:09.756 --> 23:11.157
and then when you're looking
for jobs

23:11.190 --> 23:12.659
you'll be
behind the pack and...

23:12.692 --> 23:14.794
I'm not taking it
as an elective.

23:14.827 --> 23:15.995
I'm switching
specialties.

23:16.028 --> 23:17.864
What are you
talking about?

23:17.897 --> 23:20.800
I don't want
to be a surgeon.

23:20.833 --> 23:22.635
What did he say to you?

23:22.669 --> 23:23.870
Actually, Dr. Dubenko's been
very supportive about this.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.104
Unbelievable.

23:25.137 --> 23:26.172
You know, I told him
I would work with you,

23:26.205 --> 23:27.940
I told him
I would mentor you,

23:27.974 --> 23:30.977
and for what? So he could
eventually squeeze you out?

23:31.010 --> 23:32.679
(beeper beeping)
Damn, it's the ER.

23:32.712 --> 23:34.914
Look, stay here and call me
with Sheryl's next crit.

23:34.947 --> 23:36.583
And don't worry.

23:36.616 --> 23:37.484
I'll handle this.
I'm not worried, Neela.

23:37.517 --> 23:39.486
Harold Zelinsky,

23:39.519 --> 23:41.521
you will be a great surgeon.

23:41.554 --> 23:43.155
This is what you're supposed
to be doing.

23:43.189 --> 23:45.525
I'm not going to let one person
get in the way of that.

23:48.495 --> 23:50.497
Is that for Hank?

23:50.530 --> 23:51.931
Yeah.

23:51.964 --> 23:54.701
His K's 3.2, so Morris
wants 40 in the bag.

23:54.734 --> 23:56.903
You okay?

23:56.936 --> 23:59.539
Yeah, it just he's not
the best surgical candidate,

23:59.572 --> 24:01.240
but I can't get Becky
to listen to me.

24:01.273 --> 24:02.775
Hmm.

24:02.809 --> 24:04.677
Well, you know
what your problem is.

24:04.711 --> 24:07.514
You don't know
how to talk to women.

24:07.547 --> 24:09.115
Yeah, that's my problem.

24:09.148 --> 24:11.050
Mm-hmm.

24:11.083 --> 24:12.218
Well, I'll teach you, but...

24:12.251 --> 24:14.621
(clicks tongue)

24:14.654 --> 24:16.589
...it's going to take
a really long time.

24:19.759 --> 24:22.529
I better get this up.

24:23.663 --> 24:25.732
Onset of pain was an hour ago.

24:25.765 --> 24:26.899
(grunts)

24:26.933 --> 24:28.535
He's infarcting
everything

24:28.568 --> 24:30.603
from the jejunum to
the transverse colon.

24:30.637 --> 24:32.238
We have to correct this.

24:32.271 --> 24:34.574
With surgery?
Well, we were
discussing TPA

24:34.607 --> 24:35.842
as an alternative.

24:35.875 --> 24:39.546
I'm talking
about local TPA.

24:39.579 --> 24:41.614
Well, it's a good idea
in theory, but...

24:41.648 --> 24:42.815
It might
not work?

24:42.849 --> 24:44.050
And we would lose
valuable time.

24:44.083 --> 24:45.852
Mrs. Riley, if, uh,

24:45.885 --> 24:47.920
we get Radiology down here,
you can get another opinion,

24:47.954 --> 24:50.723
and if they have a good track
record with TPA with catheter,

24:50.757 --> 24:52.625
then it might be
worth considering.

24:52.659 --> 24:54.260
But if we
wait too long

24:54.293 --> 24:57.196
and his bowel dies,
he's at risk for sepsis.

24:57.229 --> 24:58.598
What's sepsis?

24:58.631 --> 25:00.199
It's an infection.

25:00.232 --> 25:02.735
I just want to do
what's best for Hank.

25:02.769 --> 25:04.003
Why don't we at least talk
to Radiology?

25:04.036 --> 25:05.572
Enough!
Why won't you listen?!

25:05.605 --> 25:07.273
Surgery is not necessarily
the best option.

25:07.306 --> 25:09.642
You'll never change, will you?

25:09.676 --> 25:11.177
You can't ever let
someone else be right.

25:12.745 --> 25:14.714
Let's do a liter of saline
an hour

25:14.747 --> 25:15.848
for two hours.

25:15.882 --> 25:16.983
Hey, Dr. Pratt.

25:17.016 --> 25:18.918
Hey.
Any news?

25:18.951 --> 25:21.588
Yeah, his hormones causing
too much calcium in his blood.

25:21.621 --> 25:22.755
So that's what made
his bones break?

25:22.789 --> 25:24.123
His bones are
very brittle;

25:24.156 --> 25:25.792
it doesn't take much
to cause a fracture.

25:25.825 --> 25:27.627
Then this is just going
to keep happening or what?

25:27.660 --> 25:29.596
No.

25:29.596 --> 25:31.598
He can have surgery to remove
some of the parathyroid glands

25:31.631 --> 25:33.032
and his bones will
become strong again.

25:33.065 --> 25:36.202
So how long is he going
to be in the hospital for?

25:36.235 --> 25:37.269
About a week.

25:37.303 --> 25:39.038
(sighs)

25:39.071 --> 25:41.340
I... really don't want
to stay with a foster family.

25:41.373 --> 25:43.342
All right,
tell me something.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.211
How do you get to school
in the morning?

25:45.244 --> 25:48.114
Uh, my friend's mom--
she picks me up.

25:48.147 --> 25:49.616
And what do you do
after school?

25:49.616 --> 25:51.117
Bus tables at a diner
near my house.

25:51.150 --> 25:53.653
Get home
around 7:00.

25:53.686 --> 25:55.922
What if I told you you
could take care of yourself

25:55.955 --> 25:57.624
while your dad is
in the hospital?

25:57.657 --> 25:59.025
Seriously?

26:01.694 --> 26:03.262
What about the social worker?

26:03.295 --> 26:05.732
Well, as long as you come in
every day and visit your dad

26:05.765 --> 26:07.767
and check in with me,

26:07.800 --> 26:09.636
I'll take care of
the social worker.

26:12.038 --> 26:13.940
Thanks, Dr. Pratt.

26:13.973 --> 26:15.074
No problem.

26:17.043 --> 26:18.077
Hey, what's going on

26:18.110 --> 26:19.078
with Sarah's granddad?

26:19.111 --> 26:20.913
Eh, could be better.

26:20.947 --> 26:23.683
All right, well,
keep me posted.

26:23.716 --> 26:25.685
I hope you're right
about this.

26:25.718 --> 26:27.987
Me, too.

26:28.020 --> 26:29.822
I was sorry to hear
about Julia.

26:29.856 --> 26:30.957
Oh, thanks.

26:30.990 --> 26:32.158
I'm fine.

26:32.191 --> 26:34.226
Seems that way.

26:34.260 --> 26:35.895
Julia's plane hasn't
even landed in Bangkok

26:35.928 --> 26:38.330
and you've already
moved on to Sam.

26:38.364 --> 26:40.032
Actually,
she went to Nepal.

26:40.066 --> 26:41.668
Eh, whatever.

26:41.668 --> 26:43.069
What, are you jealous?
Please.

26:43.102 --> 26:44.704
You don't see anything
wrong with the fact

26:44.737 --> 26:46.272
that you go from relationship
to relationship?

26:46.305 --> 26:47.674
Doesn't work out,
I move on.

26:47.707 --> 26:48.941
Yeah, well,
it wouldn't kill you

26:48.975 --> 26:50.677
to think about someone
other than yourself.

26:50.710 --> 26:51.711
What does that mean?

26:51.744 --> 26:52.845
Sarah, maybe?

26:52.879 --> 26:54.080
You really want
to go there?

26:54.113 --> 26:56.082
You would rather be
with the wrong person

26:56.115 --> 26:57.684
than be on your own,

26:57.717 --> 26:59.686
and in the wake of all these
failed relationships

26:59.686 --> 27:02.388
sits a girl in desperate need
of stability.
I give her stability.

27:02.421 --> 27:04.156
I help with her homework.
I cook her dinner.

27:04.190 --> 27:05.958
She can talk to me
about anything.

27:05.992 --> 27:08.060
Like how there's a different
woman in your bed every month?

27:12.965 --> 27:15.234
Mrs. Riley,

27:15.267 --> 27:17.103
the surgical consent forms.

27:17.136 --> 27:19.839
Before you sign anything,
please read it carefully

27:19.872 --> 27:22.975
and understand, um,
all the risks involved

27:23.009 --> 27:24.176
with Hank's surgery.

27:26.278 --> 27:29.749
I, uh, I'm not sure.

27:29.782 --> 27:33.352
Well, there are always
potential complications.

27:33.385 --> 27:36.155
This says "brain
damage, death."

27:36.188 --> 27:37.824
I thought you said...
Well, right now the benefits

27:37.857 --> 27:39.859
of surgery
outweigh the risks.

27:39.892 --> 27:41.127
But he could die.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.394
This says
he could die.

27:46.833 --> 27:49.301
No, no, there's got
to be a better way.

27:50.937 --> 27:52.138
Tony, this is not
how we were supposed

27:52.171 --> 27:53.940
to spend the day.

27:53.973 --> 27:55.441
We were supposed to be out
with our granddaughter...

27:58.144 --> 28:00.246
...not stuck
in this godforsaken hospital.

28:00.279 --> 28:04.116
I know it's a
lot to absorb.

28:04.150 --> 28:06.753
Tony, maybe you were right.
Do the TPA thing.

28:06.753 --> 28:08.821
Then he won't
need surgery.

28:15.527 --> 28:18.765
Hank should have the surgery.

28:18.765 --> 28:20.900
But you said it wasn't
necessary; you, you said...

28:20.933 --> 28:23.269
Becky, Dr. Rasgotra
is an excellent surgeon,

28:23.302 --> 28:25.371
and if she and Dr. Morris
recommend this,

28:25.404 --> 28:28.174
then I'd say we go
for it, trust them,

28:28.207 --> 28:31.010
and we'll all do
everything we can

28:31.043 --> 28:34.113
to make sure
this turns out right.

28:34.146 --> 28:35.081
Okay?

28:42.421 --> 28:45.224
DUBENKO:
More traction on the pancreas.

28:45.257 --> 28:47.359
Where do we access the SMA?

28:47.393 --> 28:49.328
Neela?

28:50.830 --> 28:52.464
Neela, the course
of the artery?

28:54.133 --> 28:56.803
Neela.

28:56.803 --> 28:59.038
Inferior to the
uncinate process,

28:59.071 --> 29:00.506
superior to the duodenum.

29:00.539 --> 29:02.274
Exactly.

29:02.308 --> 29:03.275
Vessel loops,

29:03.309 --> 29:04.310
help me get
distal control.

29:06.846 --> 29:08.848
Oh, crap.

29:08.881 --> 29:10.549
Lap pad.

29:10.582 --> 29:11.951
Suction.
Systolic down to 90.

29:11.984 --> 29:13.285
Hang another unit.

29:13.319 --> 29:15.387
I-I can't see a
damn thing in here.

29:15.421 --> 29:17.890
Did we nick the IVC?

29:22.428 --> 29:24.163
I think we sheared off
some venous tributaries.

29:24.196 --> 29:26.198
Start with hemoclips,

29:26.232 --> 29:28.500
50 prolene on a C-1 needle in
case we're into the vessel wall.

29:28.534 --> 29:30.369
Let's go.

29:30.402 --> 29:31.403
Was I acting crazy?

29:31.437 --> 29:32.972
(chuckles)

29:33.005 --> 29:35.007
Well, that was the calcium
talking, but no worries.

29:35.041 --> 29:38.244
So when I get home, Nicky has to
wait on me hand and foot, right?

29:38.277 --> 29:39.278
Yeah, well,
it couldn't hurt.

29:39.311 --> 29:40.479
Just to be
on the safe side.

29:40.512 --> 29:42.849
Yeah, sure.

29:42.882 --> 29:44.550
(Pratt chuckles)

29:44.583 --> 29:45.885
So I'll see
you tomorrow.

29:45.918 --> 29:47.153
Yeah, right after school.

29:47.186 --> 29:48.487
I just got to be
at work by 4:00.

29:48.520 --> 29:49.922
All right.

29:49.956 --> 29:52.158
Thanks again.
You got it.

29:52.191 --> 29:54.093
Never have I been
so happy to be wrong.

29:54.126 --> 29:55.928
Yeah, well, sometimes
you go with your gut;

29:55.962 --> 29:58.464
other times you got to force
yourself to be objective.

29:58.497 --> 30:00.132
Yeah, I should have
slowed down.

30:00.166 --> 30:03.069
Yeah, and I could have taken
a few cleansing breaths.

30:03.102 --> 30:05.872
I'm taking this new
management course.

30:05.905 --> 30:07.373
How's that going
for you?

30:07.406 --> 30:09.842
Well, I'm working on
conflict resolution.

30:09.876 --> 30:11.510
So you got a few weeks
to go, huh?

30:11.543 --> 30:14.046
(laughs)

30:14.080 --> 30:17.016
(exhales loudly)

30:18.450 --> 30:21.087
Stop breathing so loud!

30:21.120 --> 30:22.354
Stop tapping your pen!

30:22.388 --> 30:23.890
Mouth breather.

30:23.923 --> 30:25.124
Pen-tapping
garden gnome.

30:25.157 --> 30:26.525
Garden gnome?

30:26.558 --> 30:28.360
All right, guys, guys.
Come on now! What...?

30:28.394 --> 30:31.230
(sighs)
All right, wait, look.

30:31.263 --> 30:33.499
Archie, Frank,
just-just tell me what's wrong.

30:33.532 --> 30:34.633
Frank is a
hypocrite!
Morris is an idiot!

30:34.666 --> 30:36.135
No, no. Come on,
one at a time.

30:36.168 --> 30:37.136
Frank's a hypocrite.

30:37.169 --> 30:38.404
Okay, look,

30:38.437 --> 30:40.572
starting your sentences
with "I feel."

30:45.544 --> 30:48.014
I feel...

30:48.047 --> 30:50.016
like Frank...

30:50.049 --> 30:51.650
is a big, fat hypocrite.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.419
That's not what I meant.
I feel...

30:53.452 --> 30:55.321
hurt because
Archie had a party,

30:55.354 --> 30:59.325
and he invited
everyone but me.

30:59.358 --> 31:02.061
See, that's good.
That's very good, Frank.

31:04.196 --> 31:06.465
Can I...
Can I go again?

31:09.701 --> 31:11.237
(clears throat)

31:11.270 --> 31:13.205
I feel...

31:14.440 --> 31:16.575
...like Frank
is hypocritical

31:16.608 --> 31:19.545
because he told me he
hated sushi and karaoke.

31:19.578 --> 31:22.348
I didn't think... I didn't
think you'd want to go.

31:22.381 --> 31:25.251
I could have grabbed a burger
on the way over there.

31:25.284 --> 31:26.218
What about the karaoke?

31:26.252 --> 31:27.954
I don't want to do it.

31:27.954 --> 31:30.356
I don't mind watching you
make an ass out of yourself.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.963
I'm... I'm sorry.

31:36.963 --> 31:40.299
I'm s... Come here.
Come here, you big lug.

31:40.332 --> 31:41.633
I'm sorry.

31:41.667 --> 31:43.702
Oh!

31:43.735 --> 31:46.272
Can I buy you
a cup of coffee?

31:46.305 --> 31:48.174
Yeah.
Yeah.

31:53.279 --> 31:55.247
(chuckles)
Wow.

31:55.281 --> 31:57.249
RASGOTRA:
Keep his fluids at 125,

31:57.283 --> 31:59.185
and, uh, CBC
in an hour.

31:59.218 --> 32:00.352
Hey.

32:00.386 --> 32:01.653
Surgery is over, Hank.

32:01.687 --> 32:03.122
We got the clot out.

32:03.155 --> 32:04.556
Neela, can we talk?

32:04.590 --> 32:06.292
All right, all right,
I'll buy you lunch.

32:06.325 --> 32:07.559
I'll meet you
in Recovery.

32:07.593 --> 32:08.727
Wherever you want.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.262
(coins jingling)
I have...

32:10.296 --> 32:12.131
52 cents.
I'm sorry.

32:12.164 --> 32:13.265
And I haven't spoken to Lucien
yet, either, but I will...

32:13.299 --> 32:14.600
It was my decision to leave.

32:14.633 --> 32:16.702
Lucien had nothing
to do with it.
What?

32:16.735 --> 32:18.170
I'm not cut out
for surgery.

32:18.204 --> 32:19.338
Of course
you are. You're...

32:19.371 --> 32:21.273
No, listen.
I'm not.

32:21.307 --> 32:23.509
I see how much you've given
up to become a surgeon,

32:23.542 --> 32:26.278
and I admire that, but
I want to have a life.

32:26.312 --> 32:28.514
Harold.

32:28.547 --> 32:30.316
I don't want
to end up alone.

32:30.349 --> 32:31.650
No offense.

32:31.683 --> 32:33.285
Oh, come on. You're young.

32:33.319 --> 32:36.388
By the time I finish
my residency, I'll be 26.

32:36.422 --> 32:39.391
If I want to do a fellowship,
I won't be done until I'm 29.

32:39.425 --> 32:42.528
29, Neela! You might as well
just put a bullet in my head.

32:42.561 --> 32:43.695
You're overstressed.

32:43.729 --> 32:45.197
You just need a break.

32:45.231 --> 32:48.167
Neela, it's over.

32:48.200 --> 32:50.169
Was I not a good teacher?

32:50.202 --> 32:51.403
Did we not spend
enough time together?

32:51.437 --> 32:53.105
We both did our best
to make this work.

32:53.139 --> 32:56.042
Well, was it something
I said or didn't say?

32:56.075 --> 32:58.044
It's not you, Neela.

33:00.179 --> 33:02.648
It's me.

33:11.823 --> 33:14.793
BETINA:
So you think they can do the
pullthrough at the same time?

33:14.826 --> 33:17.363
MAN:
With familial polyposis,
they do everything they can...

33:17.396 --> 33:18.730
Just give me
one more minute.

33:18.764 --> 33:20.332
...to avoid a colostomy,

33:20.366 --> 33:21.633
but it's a real
possibility.

33:21.667 --> 33:23.069
I see.

33:23.102 --> 33:24.303
Hey.
Hi, Greg.

33:24.336 --> 33:25.571
What are you doing here?

33:25.604 --> 33:27.073
I didn't know
you were on today.

33:27.073 --> 33:28.640
I'm not.

33:28.674 --> 33:30.709
I'm just going over
a case here with Grant.

33:30.742 --> 33:32.144
You two know
each other, right?

33:32.178 --> 33:33.279
Grant Hayward, Oncology.

33:33.312 --> 33:34.280
Yeah, I've seen you around.

33:34.313 --> 33:35.281
Hi.

33:35.314 --> 33:36.648
So, what were you talking about,

33:36.682 --> 33:38.250
that Wilms kid
that we scanned yesterday?

33:38.284 --> 33:39.618
No.

33:39.651 --> 33:41.387
Wow. It was a crazy
adrenal tumor.

33:41.420 --> 33:43.122
Took up the whole
abdominal cavity.

33:43.155 --> 33:47.593
We're talking
about me, Greg.

33:47.626 --> 33:49.428
You're not allergic
to roses, are you?

33:49.461 --> 33:51.430
No. These are
really beautiful,

33:51.463 --> 33:52.664
but kind of
embarrassing.

33:52.698 --> 33:54.700
Well, I had
a good time with you.

33:54.733 --> 33:56.635
I just wanted
to let you know.

33:56.668 --> 33:59.571
Yeah, well, I heard that
the other night loud and clear.

33:59.605 --> 34:00.839
(laughs)
Oh.

34:00.872 --> 34:02.208
Well, no. I-I...

34:02.241 --> 34:03.609
You know, I
like you. I...

34:03.642 --> 34:05.411
You know, it's
not just about...

34:05.444 --> 34:07.779
Keeping a full dance card?

34:07.813 --> 34:09.581
Right. It's not
just about that.

34:09.614 --> 34:10.815
Uh-huh. Shoot!

34:10.849 --> 34:12.551
I was gonna use you
and abuse you,

34:12.583 --> 34:13.719
and then throw you out.

34:13.752 --> 34:15.621
Now, why would
you do that?

34:15.654 --> 34:18.657
'Cause doctors have been doing
that to nurses for years now.

34:18.690 --> 34:19.791
It's a little
karmic retribution.

34:19.824 --> 34:21.560
You want me
to play nurse?

34:21.592 --> 34:22.628
I'll try anything once.

34:22.661 --> 34:23.762
(laughs)
I have a...

34:23.795 --> 34:25.697
Hey, Archie.
Hi, Archie.

34:25.731 --> 34:28.699
Sam, I figured it out.

34:28.734 --> 34:31.703
You're sending them
to yourself, right?

34:31.737 --> 34:33.172
(sighs)

34:33.205 --> 34:34.639
You got me.

34:34.672 --> 34:37.176
Ha! Good night, guys.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.485
Hmm. Ooh.

34:46.518 --> 34:48.554
No!

34:48.587 --> 34:50.522
Hey.

34:52.591 --> 34:54.159
Everything okay?

34:54.193 --> 34:55.694
Last weekend,

34:55.726 --> 34:59.598
my college roommate
had a baby shower

34:59.631 --> 35:00.832
for her third kid.

35:00.866 --> 35:02.401
Who does that?

35:02.434 --> 35:03.569
Oh, I don't know.

35:03.602 --> 35:05.837
Somebody desperate
for attention?

35:05.871 --> 35:07.306
Maybe Sheryl
had it right.

35:07.339 --> 35:09.575
I should have popped
out four kids,

35:09.608 --> 35:11.177
and then gone
to med school.

35:11.177 --> 35:12.678
Four kids?
You want four kids?

35:12.711 --> 35:15.181
Oh! I don't even know
if I want kids,

35:15.181 --> 35:17.283
but if I did, I
couldn't have them now.

35:17.316 --> 35:18.717
I don't have time
to do laundry,

35:18.750 --> 35:20.219
much less have sex.

35:20.252 --> 35:22.788
Wait. Meet someone.
Then have sex.

35:22.821 --> 35:25.324
You could meet someone.

35:25.357 --> 35:28.827
Yeah, I turned down a date
last week so I could sleep.

35:30.762 --> 35:34.233
The closest thing I have
to a personal relationship

35:34.266 --> 35:36.368
is Harold Zelinsky,

35:36.402 --> 35:38.604
a 19-year-old intern,

35:38.637 --> 35:41.707
and he just dumped me.

35:41.740 --> 35:46.212
Well, you-you have a personal
relationship with me, right?

35:46.212 --> 35:47.746
We're-We're friends.

35:47.779 --> 35:49.681
You know what?
Go home.

35:49.715 --> 35:52.451
You're tired.

35:52.484 --> 35:54.786
I'm 31 today.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.222
It's your birthday?

35:59.591 --> 36:01.560
Oh, Neela, I'm sorry.

36:01.593 --> 36:03.929
I didn't realize.

36:03.962 --> 36:05.697
Oh, don't worry.

36:05.731 --> 36:07.933
Nobody did.

36:07.966 --> 36:10.369
(sighs)

36:20.246 --> 36:22.248
Here.

36:23.249 --> 36:25.651
Happy birthday.

36:27.253 --> 36:30.389
I'm sorry I don't have a candle.

36:30.422 --> 36:32.691
(laughs)

36:36.027 --> 36:38.597
Thank you.

36:41.032 --> 36:42.468
No, don't eat it.
That's disgust...

36:42.501 --> 36:43.702
Oh, that's disgusting.

36:43.735 --> 36:45.671
It's been out
since this morning.

36:45.704 --> 36:47.639
Spit that out.

36:47.673 --> 36:49.708
(sighs)

36:49.741 --> 36:51.710
I can't do this.

36:53.044 --> 36:54.446
(sniffles)

36:54.480 --> 36:55.781
You know, I fell asleep

36:55.814 --> 36:58.317
in the shower
this morning, and...

36:58.350 --> 37:02.521
Well, it doesn't...
it doesn't matter.

37:02.554 --> 37:04.590
But I realized,

37:04.623 --> 37:08.594
I'm going through life
as if everything's okay.

37:09.928 --> 37:11.963
But it's... it's not.

37:23.041 --> 37:24.943
Come on.

37:24.976 --> 37:27.045
What are you doing?

37:27.078 --> 37:29.315
Pity party's over.

37:36.555 --> 37:39.691
Here. What do you see?

37:39.725 --> 37:40.826
A happy family
who came...

37:40.859 --> 37:43.562
I see a mom

37:43.595 --> 37:45.331
who was this close to
dying from a torn aorta.

37:45.364 --> 37:46.465
You made a critical diagnosis
and performed a flawless

37:46.498 --> 37:49.501
anastamosis
of a bifemoral Y graft.

37:52.037 --> 37:53.972
And in there,

37:54.005 --> 37:57.743
I see a grandfather
who could have died
from ischemic bowel,

37:57.776 --> 37:59.878
but thanks to you, he'll be
eating filet mignon soon.

37:59.911 --> 38:01.647
Yeah, but...

38:01.680 --> 38:04.583
I don't care how many babies
people have or how many dates

38:04.616 --> 38:06.017
you miss.

38:06.051 --> 38:08.687
Very few people could
have done what you did today.

38:08.720 --> 38:11.923
Hey, you have a gift, Neela.

38:12.991 --> 38:15.694
You have a gift.

38:15.727 --> 38:19.365
The minute you start
comparing yourself to others

38:19.365 --> 38:21.032
is the minute
that you forget

38:21.066 --> 38:23.769
you're doing exactly
what you are meant to do.

38:29.007 --> 38:30.976
Your shift ended
15 minutes ago.

38:31.009 --> 38:32.444
You should go home.

38:32.478 --> 38:34.480
You look like hell.

38:40.719 --> 38:43.655
(sighs)

38:45.391 --> 38:46.892
Will he be able
to walk his horses?

38:48.527 --> 38:51.830
Uh, for shorter distances
to start with, but yes.

38:54.700 --> 38:55.801
Good.

38:55.834 --> 38:57.503
He loves that.

38:57.536 --> 38:59.605
Maybe, uh, lay off
the air hockey

38:59.638 --> 39:00.639
for a little while.

39:00.672 --> 39:01.840
(laughs)

39:01.873 --> 39:03.074
He kept beating me anyway.

39:08.414 --> 39:10.749
Thanks, Neela.

39:11.883 --> 39:14.453
Sure thing.

39:14.486 --> 39:16.822
BETINA:
Every year I get a colonoscopy,
and every year it's fine.

39:16.855 --> 39:18.790
I guess I was starting
to believe

39:18.824 --> 39:21.860
that it wasn't going to happen,
which is ridiculous, because,

39:21.893 --> 39:24.996
in my family, it's not
a question of if, but when.

39:25.030 --> 39:27.599
Yeah, but if you get the
surgery, you'll have no chance

39:27.633 --> 39:29.501
of getting colon cancer,
so you'll be okay.

39:29.535 --> 39:30.702
Everything will
be fine, right?

39:30.736 --> 39:32.103
Until I develop
a post-op desmoid

39:32.137 --> 39:34.673
or hepatoblastoma
or thyroid cancer.

39:34.706 --> 39:36.675
Oh, come on.
You don't know that.

39:36.708 --> 39:39.778
I was born with a defective
tumor suppressor gene.

39:39.811 --> 39:43.882
Colon cancer
is just the beginning.

39:48.186 --> 39:50.155
Why didn't you tell me?

39:50.188 --> 39:52.891
You showed your hand.

39:52.924 --> 39:53.925
I knew you weren't
cut out for this.

39:53.959 --> 39:55.494
I can handle it.

39:55.527 --> 39:57.996
Really? You want
to change my colostomy bag?

39:58.029 --> 40:01.967
That's touching,
but I don't think so.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.835
All right, look,
maybe in the past, I...

40:03.869 --> 40:06.905
You weren't 100% committed
when things were easy,

40:06.938 --> 40:08.740
so don't try to tell me now,

40:08.774 --> 40:11.142
all of a sudden,
that you can handle it.

40:12.210 --> 40:13.745
I don't need your pity.

40:13.779 --> 40:14.846
It's not pity.

40:18.216 --> 40:21.219
You shouldn't have
to go through this alone.

40:21.252 --> 40:23.622
It was my choice
to end our relationship.

40:23.655 --> 40:25.624
You don't have to call.

40:25.657 --> 40:27.926
You don't have
to check up on me.

40:27.959 --> 40:29.661
This is not your problem, Greg.

40:29.695 --> 40:30.896
Betina.

40:30.929 --> 40:33.532
I'm letting you off the hook.

40:35.934 --> 40:37.803
Hey, I got you
some food.

40:37.836 --> 40:39.771
I figured you and Sarah must be
pretty hungry for dinner, huh?

40:39.805 --> 40:41.807
Oh, thank you.

40:41.840 --> 40:43.008
Listen, Hank
is, um...

40:43.041 --> 40:45.010
He's going to be
here for a week.

40:45.043 --> 40:47.613
Uh, so until then, I
think Sarah would love it

40:47.646 --> 40:49.014
if you would
stay with us.

40:49.047 --> 40:52.017
Thank you.
That's very generous.

40:52.050 --> 40:55.153
I'm sorry for how
I treated you.

40:55.186 --> 40:56.955
It's been a
stressful day.

40:56.988 --> 40:59.024
Not just today.

40:59.057 --> 41:01.192
I remember
the first time I met you.

41:01.226 --> 41:04.029
You were this messed-up vet
back from the war

41:04.062 --> 41:05.597
running around
with my daughter.

41:05.631 --> 41:06.932
Yes, I was.

41:06.965 --> 41:08.600
Meg used to say you changed,
that you grew up,

41:08.634 --> 41:11.903
but I didn't believe it,
not really.

41:11.937 --> 41:14.272
Until today.

41:14.305 --> 41:15.674
Thank you.

41:16.908 --> 41:18.176
How's he doing?
Very well.

41:18.209 --> 41:19.778
When we restored
the blood supply

41:19.811 --> 41:21.780
to his intestines,
they pinked up right away.

41:21.813 --> 41:22.948
That's a good sign.

41:22.981 --> 41:24.883
Thank you,
Dr. Rasgotra.

41:24.916 --> 41:26.985
Well, I'm about
to go off duty.

41:27.018 --> 41:29.020
I will check on
him first thing.

41:29.054 --> 41:30.822
I'll be there.

41:34.626 --> 41:38.830
Listen, about
what you said,

41:38.864 --> 41:40.899
me dating Sam...

41:40.932 --> 41:43.168
Yeah, um, about that.

41:43.201 --> 41:47.806
I-I said some awful things,
and... I'm sorry.

41:49.641 --> 41:51.877
Uh, to say I'm
sleep-deprived

41:51.910 --> 41:53.945
would be a massive
understatement,

41:53.979 --> 41:56.748
so I would just like
to blame it on the, uh...

41:56.782 --> 41:59.618
the frontal lobe malfunction
and call it a day.

41:59.651 --> 42:01.720
It's okay
with you?
Sure.

42:04.055 --> 42:05.824
Hey, Mayday.

42:05.857 --> 42:08.794
Happy birthday.

42:08.827 --> 42:10.596
Thank you.

42:16.367 --> 42:18.904
(phone ringing)

42:19.871 --> 42:23.074
Neela Rasgotra.

42:23.108 --> 42:25.143
Oh, I-I know. I'm-I'm sorry.

42:25.176 --> 42:27.746
Um, I was stuck at work.

42:27.779 --> 42:29.648
Well, can they come tomorrow?

42:29.681 --> 42:32.984
Well, how hard is it
to hook up cable?

42:33.018 --> 42:34.319
Three weeks?!

42:34.352 --> 42:36.955
Well, I'll leave a key
under the mat.

42:36.988 --> 42:38.757
Yes, I'm serious.

42:38.790 --> 42:41.627
Look, I'm a doctor,
and I'm single.

42:41.627 --> 42:45.096
All I have is Project Runway.
