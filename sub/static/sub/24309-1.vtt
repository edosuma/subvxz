02:12.125 --> 02:16.375

02:52.458 --> 02:54.416
<i>The base is four square miles,</i>

02:54.500 --> 02:57.333
with a working population of 3,000 people.

02:58.125 --> 03:00.666
Got 20,000 acres of training fields.

03:01.791 --> 03:04.875
We even have a supermarket,
a cinema, and a mall.

03:05.416 --> 03:06.875
All under NATO command?

03:06.958 --> 03:09.083
Joint initiative
with the Defense Science Office,

03:09.500 --> 03:12.250
and the British Department
of Science and Technology, of course.

03:12.333 --> 03:14.750
To be sure, Lieutenant,
we're highly classified.

03:15.250 --> 03:17.500
Communication with the outside world
will be limited.

03:17.583 --> 03:19.375
No different at Edwards or Dryden, sir.

03:25.125 --> 03:27.583
<i>This whole street</i>
<i>is part of the new expansion.</i>

03:28.375 --> 03:29.916
A total new-build.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.250
I'm excited to show you.

03:34.666 --> 03:35.666
Welcome.

03:40.958 --> 03:43.416
There's two bedrooms upstairs.

03:44.166 --> 03:46.625
The lights are motion-activated.

03:47.958 --> 03:53.291
There's three bathrooms, a media room,
and an automated kitchen.

03:56.708 --> 03:58.041
Hey, don't listen to Jim.

03:58.708 --> 04:00.291
I mean, Colonel Peterson.

04:00.791 --> 04:04.125
If you want to call friends and family,
feel free. We trust you.

04:06.500 --> 04:09.625
Look, if you need anything, call me.
Day or night.

04:10.666 --> 04:11.750
Thank you, Freya.

04:25.791 --> 04:27.208
Mom, come look!

04:32.583 --> 04:34.250
-Come on.
-Check this, hon.

04:40.041 --> 04:41.500
Which one are you going to?

04:42.708 --> 04:44.666
You can't see it. You need a telescope.

04:48.958 --> 04:49.958
But it's out there.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.291
And you'll be there too someday.

05:41.125 --> 05:42.541
Down, down, down.

05:47.500 --> 05:49.958
Are you ready? Only got the one.

05:50.041 --> 05:51.791
-Yeah.
-Careful.

05:54.666 --> 05:55.541
Okay.

06:01.666 --> 06:05.083
-Professor Collingwood.

06:05.583 --> 06:07.708
It is so good to see you.

06:10.375 --> 06:14.458
You don't know how happy I was
to throw your Dryden test results

06:14.541 --> 06:15.458
into NASA's face.

06:16.791 --> 06:18.208
Absolutely incredible.

06:18.291 --> 06:20.625
It's just an honor
to have been selected, sir.

06:20.958 --> 06:23.416
I've been teaching the past years,
didn't think I still had it.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.125
Don't call me "sir." I don't have a rank.

06:26.875 --> 06:28.583
I'm just not gonna let you down.

06:30.750 --> 06:32.791
I know how much this means to you, Rick.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.041
But... pioneering isn't without its risks.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.208
Yeah, well, first one through the wall
always gets a little bloody.

06:45.125 --> 06:46.625
He's gonna get sick, isn't he?

06:47.291 --> 06:48.291
Temporarily.

06:48.750 --> 06:50.416
He'll need committed aftercare.

06:51.166 --> 06:52.833
He won't seem himself at times.

06:55.833 --> 06:58.125
Rick crossed the Syrian desert
injured and alone

06:58.208 --> 07:01.041
without food or water for three days.

07:01.125 --> 07:03.875
Well, this will make that look
like a walk in the park.

07:04.625 --> 07:05.875
But we'll get through it.

07:07.708 --> 07:10.625
Dr. Janssen, I admire your courage.

07:11.791 --> 07:14.041
Rick wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you.

07:15.083 --> 07:18.041
I want to tell you that I'm--
I'm grateful.

07:18.583 --> 07:20.583
You don't have to charm me, Professor.

07:21.208 --> 07:23.875
I've studied your work.
I know what we're doing.

07:23.958 --> 07:25.583
It's bigger than all of us.

07:25.666 --> 07:27.833
Yes, yes, yes. I know that, but it's...

07:28.833 --> 07:31.875
It's the concessions you made.
The medical career.

07:32.958 --> 07:34.208
The nights of worry.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.708
It's a small price to pay
for my son's future.

07:44.958 --> 07:46.458
No one attempts the impossible

07:46.541 --> 07:49.375
without belief in something greater
than themselves.

07:50.083 --> 07:52.708
Even if that something is a someone.

07:54.875 --> 07:57.416
Rick didn't cross the desert alone.

08:16.208 --> 08:19.125
<i>Our population</i>
<i>has grown out of control.</i>

08:20.291 --> 08:22.375
<i>Our environment is in decay.</i>

08:24.125 --> 08:26.541
<i>Our resources have been depleted.</i>

08:28.583 --> 08:30.541
<i>Wars have ravaged our planet.</i>

08:32.000 --> 08:35.791
<i>We are fighting over the scraps</i>
<i>of what remains.</i>

08:39.000 --> 08:42.416
<i>In ten years, half the planet</i>
<i>will be uninhabitable.</i>

08:44.416 --> 08:49.958
<i>In 15 years, half the world's population</i>
<i>will have starved to death.</i>

08:51.666 --> 08:53.416
Time is running out.

08:56.208 --> 08:58.083
We've outgrown our home.

08:59.041 --> 09:02.333
Our children will witness the end of days.

09:05.541 --> 09:09.333
But there is one place that gives us hope.

09:10.083 --> 09:10.916
Titan.

09:11.916 --> 09:14.458
The largest moon of Saturn.

09:15.416 --> 09:19.625
The only other place in our solar system
with an atmosphere.

09:20.333 --> 09:26.333
A primordial ecosystem, just like Earth,
seconds before life was born.

09:27.166 --> 09:30.583
Liquid methane raining
into huge oceans and lakes

09:30.666 --> 09:32.041
that we can't swim in,

09:32.541 --> 09:36.541
and an atmosphere rich in nitrogen
that we can't breathe.

09:38.083 --> 09:40.000
Too cold to exist in.

09:40.083 --> 09:42.583
Fiercely hostile to life as we know it.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.791
Beyond the reach of space science,

09:45.875 --> 09:49.750
but not modern genetics.

09:49.833 --> 09:53.916
No longer trying
to reshape planets in our image...

09:54.916 --> 09:58.875
but evolving humanity into the stars.

10:00.541 --> 10:03.833
Imagine, with a few minor enhancements,

10:03.916 --> 10:07.375
you could breathe the air,
swim in the waters,

10:07.458 --> 10:09.083
and survive the cold.

10:10.250 --> 10:11.416
What if Titan...

10:13.041 --> 10:14.583
could become our home?

10:17.958 --> 10:20.625
Dr. Hernandez,
I was waiting for you to object.

10:21.208 --> 10:24.416
I still don't understand how our bodies
won't reject the treatment.

10:24.500 --> 10:25.875
Clinical trials were successful,

10:25.958 --> 10:29.291
signed off by NATO's
Science and Technology Office.

10:29.375 --> 10:33.583
-I'm talking survival of the species.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.333
HPA-axis reprogramming.

10:36.416 --> 10:38.500
Methane lipid bilayer injections.

10:38.583 --> 10:40.250
G

10:40.333 --> 10:42.416
There are no guarantees, Dr. Hernandez.

10:43.083 --> 10:45.375
Some people won't take to the drugs.

10:45.458 --> 10:48.166
Some people will break
during the training.

10:48.250 --> 10:50.583
Most of you will fail and be sent home.

10:50.666 --> 10:52.041
How many of us will die?

10:52.125 --> 10:54.541
Twenty bucks says Iker goes first.

10:55.958 --> 10:57.333
Can you read?

10:57.416 --> 10:58.291
What?

10:58.375 --> 10:59.958
I said can you read, idiot?

11:00.041 --> 11:02.125
Because if you could,
you'd see that this book

11:02.208 --> 11:03.625
is just a bunch of health warnings.

11:03.708 --> 11:05.958
-I'm just pointing out...

11:06.041 --> 11:09.333
You're pointing out nothing.
He's talking about the end of the Earth.

11:10.333 --> 11:11.875
You got kids?

11:12.416 --> 11:13.250
No.

11:13.666 --> 11:15.541
Shut the fuck up or get the fuck out.

11:18.041 --> 11:20.000
Please. Go on, Professor.

11:21.291 --> 11:24.458
I was sent 5,000 personnel files

11:24.541 --> 11:26.916
<i>from 16 NATO countries.</i> <i>I chose you, because in your past,</i>

11:29.458 --> 11:31.958
<i>each of you has shown an ability</i>

11:32.041 --> 11:34.500
<i>to survive the harshest of conditions.</i>

11:34.583 --> 11:36.416
<i>Each of you is here,</i>

11:36.500 --> 11:39.791
<i>because you understand the dire necessity</i>

11:39.875 --> 11:42.375
of finding a new home for the human race.

11:44.041 --> 11:45.625
Maybe you're mad,

11:45.708 --> 11:48.083
ambitious, adventurous.

11:48.166 --> 11:52.083
But each of you has a rare willingness
to put yourselves on the line

11:52.166 --> 11:53.541
for the sake of others.

11:54.458 --> 11:57.208
<i>My hope is, when we're finished,</i>

11:57.708 --> 12:01.750
<i>all of you will be able to stand on Titan,</i>

12:01.833 --> 12:05.041
<i>take a deep breath,</i>
<i>and swim in its waters.</i>

12:05.708 --> 12:08.083
<i>Maybe soar through its skies.</i>

12:10.125 --> 12:13.958
You will become enhanced humans.

12:14.583 --> 12:15.750
Super men.

12:17.291 --> 12:19.541
Able to live on another world.

12:20.833 --> 12:22.083
<i>You'll become you...</i>

12:24.375 --> 12:25.375
<i>but better.</i>

12:30.958 --> 12:33.208
The slingshot around Jupiter
is 50-50 at best.

12:33.291 --> 12:35.000
Not if you use a Hohmann Transfer.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.708
All right, give me two minutes, guys.

12:37.791 --> 12:40.750
You'd need propulsion of more
than 15 kilometers a second for that.

12:40.833 --> 12:41.791
It's never been done.

12:41.875 --> 12:44.375
Let's just worry about down here
before up there.

12:44.458 --> 12:47.583
Have you ever flown
on an Orion

12:47.958 --> 12:50.916
-No, I haven't.
-I bet you're the first one to crash one.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
-Better make sure you're strapped in.
-I'm riding with the astronauts!

12:54.583 --> 12:55.500
You're mad!

13:14.625 --> 13:17.958
It tracks your heart rate, blood pressure,
sodium levels, other vitals.

13:18.041 --> 13:19.666
A lot of monitoring from now on.

13:20.458 --> 13:21.583
I hope you're not squeamish.

13:21.666 --> 13:24.041
I'll be giving you over 300 shots
in the next few weeks.

13:24.125 --> 13:25.375
With what?

13:26.125 --> 13:30.250
Amino acid solutions, enzyme inhibitors,
nucleic acid polymers.

13:30.583 --> 13:33.958
The long, steady road of training
yourselves to burn nitrogen for energy.

13:34.041 --> 13:35.916
Open. And use less oxygen.

13:39.041 --> 13:41.583
Well, you'll never black out
at high altitudes ever again.

13:42.083 --> 13:44.958
What we call "air"
is more than 75% nitrogen.

13:45.875 --> 13:47.916
Oxygen only constitutes 20%.

13:48.958 --> 13:52.083
But where you're going,
the nitrogen ratio of air is 90%,

13:52.166 --> 13:53.333
oxygen less than five.

13:53.416 --> 13:55.500
So we don't need to reinvent the wheel.

13:55.583 --> 13:57.625
Just go the extra 15.

14:06.083 --> 14:08.458
-Good morning.
-Hi there.

14:08.541 --> 14:10.250
Are we gonna see you on Saturday?

14:10.333 --> 14:12.458
Oh, well, I have to see
how Zane's feeling, darling,

14:12.541 --> 14:13.916
but I'm sure we'll make it.

14:34.166 --> 14:35.000
Mom!

14:35.875 --> 14:37.541
Look at this! What is that?

14:37.625 --> 14:38.625
A fighting car.

It's okay.

18:07.916 --> 18:09.416
-Come on up. Come on up.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.083
Oh, my head.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.875
One more. Last one. It's the last one.

18:34.291 --> 18:35.250
You all right?

18:36.375 --> 18:37.208
Yeah.

19:29.833 --> 19:32.041
I never thought
I'd see something like this.

19:51.375 --> 19:53.000
What's their oxygenation?

19:53.416 --> 19:54.333
Four percent.

19:55.375 --> 19:56.500
Vitals are strong.

21:32.916 --> 21:34.625
No, no, no! Don't do anything!

22:28.500 --> 22:29.666
Whoa!

22:33.958 --> 22:35.041
Oh!

22:40.916 --> 22:44.541
<i>"Saturn's largest moon is</i>
<i>the second largest in the solar system.</i>

22:45.000 --> 22:46.375
<i>Larger than Mercury.</i>

22:46.916 --> 22:50.125
<i>Its rivers carve valleys into soil</i>
<i>rich in ammonia and nitrogen.</i>

22:51.166 --> 22:54.208
Nitrogen, which can be used
to generate breathable oxygen,

22:54.291 --> 22:57.541
or to produce fertilizer
for growing food, just like on Earth."

22:57.625 --> 22:59.708
Will I really go there with you one day?

23:02.250 --> 23:03.375
Yeah, you will.

23:04.666 --> 23:06.166
We'll go up there together.

23:07.375 --> 23:09.833
Did you know Saturn's rings
are made of ice?

23:10.791 --> 23:14.750
Did you know that there is a storm
four times the size of Earth

23:14.833 --> 23:16.583
raging for 50 years on Saturn?

23:20.250 --> 23:22.375
That's a nice try. Get some sleep.

23:29.291 --> 23:31.166
This would have blown Grandpa's mind. Yeah. Yeah, it sure would have.

23:36.541 --> 23:38.625
Can you put my stars on, please?

23:44.833 --> 23:47.541
Good night, earthling.
-Good night, Dad.

24:23.083 --> 24:24.125
Is he sleeping?

24:24.958 --> 24:25.791
Yeah.

24:28.666 --> 24:29.625
You wanna come in?

24:38.291 --> 24:39.208
Yeah.

24:41.833 --> 24:43.541
You know, he mentioned my old man.

24:44.750 --> 24:46.333
He does that from time to time.

24:49.666 --> 24:51.833
I have a feeling
he's up there watching us.

24:52.166 --> 24:53.000
Mmm.

24:54.083 --> 24:57.291
He would be so proud of you.

24:58.666 --> 25:00.958
He wouldn't have thought
I would have got this far.

25:01.833 --> 25:02.708
You...

25:04.333 --> 25:06.291
are gonna be the first man on Titan. Hey. Look at me.

25:13.666 --> 25:15.166
I believe in you.

25:16.166 --> 25:17.500
You've given me hope.

25:41.750 --> 25:43.791
Rick... Stop.

25:43.875 --> 25:44.708
What is it?

25:48.875 --> 25:51.083
What

25:53.500 --> 25:54.458
What's wrong?

25:56.791 --> 25:58.458
Hey, I love you.

26:39.583 --> 26:40.625
You little rascals.

26:40.708 --> 26:42.500
All right. Okay.

26:42.583 --> 26:44.416
Are you going to get dressed for the day?

26:44.500 --> 26:46.625
-This is for you.
-Come on. Let's go play.

26:48.791 --> 26:49.875
Barely dry.

26:49.958 --> 26:50.791
I know.

26:55.791 --> 26:57.958
Abi, can I ask you a personal question?

26:59.208 --> 27:00.416
Sure.

27:00.500 --> 27:01.875
Do you get scared?

27:03.500 --> 27:04.750
Yeah, I get scared.

27:06.166 --> 27:07.166
Does Rick know? Yeah, Rick knows.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.083
Do you pray?

27:14.416 --> 27:16.541
I guess I don't pray as much as I should.

27:18.708 --> 27:19.666
I pray.

27:22.500 --> 27:23.833
I didn't wanna come here.

27:25.833 --> 27:27.041
He's a corporal

27:27.125 --> 27:29.708
in the United States Marines,
about to make sergeant.

27:30.500 --> 27:32.208
Could have chosen his own station.

27:33.041 --> 27:36.291
He ain't got no business in space,
but I can't tell him that.

27:36.375 --> 27:37.333
Why not?

27:38.041 --> 27:40.541
'Cause he'll get mad, call me chicken.

27:42.833 --> 27:45.583
Zane's here 'cause he has
a very important job to do.

27:47.541 --> 27:49.041
He's giving us a chance.

27:49.583 --> 27:52.500
And you're here because you love him.

27:55.541 --> 27:59.125
And you want your kids to grow up
knowing that their father was a hero.

28:05.750 --> 28:06.708
Dad!

29:38.375 --> 29:39.458
What are you doing?

29:42.083 --> 29:43.208
I was just hot.

29:45.291 --> 29:46.750
Why didn't you wake me up?

29:49.958 --> 29:51.708
There's no point us both suffering.

29:52.625 --> 29:54.875
Want me to make you
an ice bath or something?

29:54.958 --> 29:55.875
It's okay.

29:57.125 --> 29:58.083
I'm okay.

30:24.875 --> 30:27.916
-Go on.
-I don't wanna put my hands in there.

30:28.875 --> 30:30.583
Go on. I wanna show you something.

30:44.541 --> 30:45.833
Jeez!

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
It's so cold!

30:55.458 --> 30:58.208
What

31:01.541 --> 31:03.208
I don't feel any cold.

31:40.416 --> 31:42.000
Let me show you something.

31:50.791 --> 31:51.958
It's beautiful.

31:53.125 --> 31:54.458
It's a shame we can't save it.

32:16.041 --> 32:17.458
Doctor, be careful in there.

32:18.583 --> 32:20.333
It's 20% liquid methane.

33:33.083 --> 33:33.958
You okay?

33:34.750 --> 33:36.750
Cold. Hurts.

33:38.541 --> 33:39.416
Then get out.

33:41.375 --> 33:42.208
No.

33:47.291 --> 33:49.166
Mind over matter.

34:30.500 --> 34:32.000
Hey, you guys losing any hair?

34:32.083 --> 34:33.625
I don't think so.

34:33.708 --> 34:35.750
I'm not losing any hair.
Still looking handsome.

34:35.833 --> 34:36.708
I lost some hair.

34:36.791 --> 34:38.000
Like, two days ago.

34:39.291 --> 34:41.041
-Here.
-Let me see.

34:42.791 --> 34:45.500
Oh, shit. A souvenir for you.

34:46.125 --> 34:47.125
He's got something.

34:51.875 --> 34:53.916
-Get up, get up, get up!

34:54.000 --> 34:55.750
We were talking
and she started convulsing.

34:55.833 --> 34:57.000
-Thirty seconds.

34:57.083 --> 34:58.458
-Stop! Get back!

34:58.541 --> 35:00.541
Okay, keep her still. Hold her.
Get the case!

35:04.041 --> 35:04.958
Hey!

35:09.625 --> 35:11.208
Stay with us. Come on, come on.

35:11.291 --> 35:13.083
Right now we're losing her!

35:40.833 --> 35:43.708
No, no, no, no, no.
The question is: who's next?

35:43.791 --> 35:46.208
They only need one or two
to prove the program.

35:47.333 --> 35:48.291
One or two?

35:48.750 --> 35:51.708
No, we're going up there together...
as a team.

35:53.625 --> 35:55.500
I heard him say exactly the opposite.

35:57.250 --> 36:00.250
No, he said we're becoming titans,
and we're going to Titan.

36:00.625 --> 36:01.833
And that's the mission.

36:01.916 --> 36:03.625
The program is the mission.

36:06.916 --> 36:08.708
Nobody said we was gonna die.

36:12.708 --> 36:14.208
We all knew the risks.

36:29.541 --> 36:32.583
-You know we're not supposed to drink.
-Yeah, that was before.

36:37.333 --> 36:38.708
Where were you stationed?

36:40.166 --> 36:41.041
Syria.

36:42.583 --> 36:43.625
Yeah, me too.

36:52.666 --> 36:54.000
You got family back home?

37:01.625 --> 37:04.541
She was this bad-ass cadet
I used to see in the mess hall.

37:05.875 --> 37:08.958
I fell hopelessly in love with her.
I used to write her poetry.

37:09.916 --> 37:11.791
I had the worst lyrics.

37:13.833 --> 37:17.333
Then one day when the war started,
they stationed her at Diego Garcia,

37:17.625 --> 37:19.333
and, um,  she left.

37:19.416 --> 37:20.750
So what did you do?

37:20.833 --> 37:21.666
Um...

37:22.583 --> 37:24.333
I went and I found her.

37:26.541 --> 37:28.458
Now he wants to start a family.

37:31.250 --> 37:33.833
But they changed the law,
so it doesn't matter now.

37:34.291 --> 37:38.041
We can't have any kids without a permit,
and we can't get one here, so...

37:38.125 --> 37:40.541
Rayenne, give us a hand, will you, love?

37:50.125 --> 37:54.125
He thinks if I go and come back,
I'll have got it out of my system.

37:56.083 --> 37:57.666
Be the good wife.

38:09.250 --> 38:11.083
I wouldn't have made it this far
without him.

38:17.333 --> 38:18.500
Well...

38:19.125 --> 38:20.041
Yeah.

38:21.875 --> 38:22.958
That's Rick.

38:48.250 --> 38:49.625
Are you okay?

38:51.666 --> 38:53.458
No, no fucking way!

38:57.500 --> 38:58.583
No, back off!

39:00.666 --> 39:02.875
-No way!

39:03.541 --> 39:05.333
-Calm down.
-No!

39:05.416 --> 39:07.500
Zane, calm down! That's an order!

39:08.916 --> 39:11.166
-Hey...
-We're here. We're here.

39:12.875 --> 39:14.541
-We got you.

39:21.625 --> 39:23.250
Let him go. Let him go.

39:27.416 --> 39:28.500
Look at me.

39:29.708 --> 39:30.666
You're with us.

39:32.833 --> 39:34.166
You'll...

39:34.916 --> 39:35.916
make it.

39:51.666 --> 39:54.416
Good. 121 over 96.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.458
The spleen seems to be having trouble
processing the treatment,

39:57.541 --> 39:59.041
putting a burden on the kidneys.

39:59.125 --> 40:02.125
Is that what killed Dr. Ramos?
Was it a known risk?

40:03.166 --> 40:04.166
Yes and no.

40:04.250 --> 40:06.375
Well, Captain Ramos
was predisposed to kidney stones,

40:06.458 --> 40:08.083
which caused the complication.

40:08.166 --> 40:09.250
I was there.

40:10.500 --> 40:12.666
That wasn't the kidney stones.

40:12.750 --> 40:13.625
Pills.

40:19.791 --> 40:20.708
May I?

40:25.750 --> 40:27.791
The pills are Flunarizine,
a calcium-channel blocker.

40:27.875 --> 40:29.041
This is potassium citrate.

40:29.125 --> 40:31.833
-Helps flush the kidneys.
-Potassium citrate's taken orally.

40:31.916 --> 40:34.708
But it's in magnesium sulfate
so it bypasses the gastric tract.

40:34.791 --> 40:36.125
-Ten grams.

40:36.208 --> 40:37.166
That's high.

40:40.291 --> 40:42.625
I'd like to speak
with Professor Collingwood.

40:43.375 --> 40:45.125
Well, he's not here, so...

40:45.208 --> 40:47.833
as soon as he's free,
I'll get him to come see you.

40:55.375 --> 40:56.541
All right.

41:07.291 --> 41:08.583
I think that's it.

41:14.458 --> 41:15.666
Mind over matter.

45:03.458 --> 45:06.291
Titan receives
much less light than Earth.

45:07.708 --> 45:10.875
By multiplying the rod cells
by up to eight times,

45:10.958 --> 45:13.208
we change the aperture of the eye...

45:14.750 --> 45:18.041
to more closely resemble
those of a feline.

45:19.625 --> 45:22.083
Allowing you to see through the darkness.

45:56.083 --> 45:57.000
Yeah.

46:21.375 --> 46:22.583
Baby?
Yeah.

46:24.625 --> 46:25.500
Rick?!

46:27.083 --> 46:28.000
Help!

46:29.208 --> 46:32.291
-I need somebody here right now!

46:32.375 --> 46:34.708
He started rubbing his eyes.
He was complaining of pain.

46:34.791 --> 46:37.000
Lieutenant, let me see your eyes. Okay.

46:37.083 --> 46:39.875
Flush his eyes. Prep him.
Get him into surgery now.

46:39.958 --> 46:43.625
No, Mrs. Janssen, you have to stay here.
When we know something, we'll tell you.

46:47.500 --> 46:49.208
-Abi, please.

46:49.291 --> 46:50.750
He is blind!

46:50.833 --> 46:53.625
-That's only temporary.
-You did not tell me everything.

46:53.708 --> 46:56.583
Now, look. You're tired. Go home,
get some rest. Freya will take care...

46:56.666 --> 46:59.291
There are cameras in our house.
I know you've been watching us.

46:59.375 --> 47:03.041
That was the Pentagon's idea.
It was for your security and ours.

47:03.125 --> 47:04.666
I argued against it at the time.

47:04.750 --> 47:07.000
If you don't like it,
I'll get rid of them. There is something alive inside of him.

47:09.958 --> 47:12.166
Something that your fucking book
doesn't talk about.

47:12.916 --> 47:14.166
He is changing.

47:14.958 --> 47:17.500
I need to keep this under control.

47:17.583 --> 47:20.333
Rick needs me. Lucas needs you.

47:20.416 --> 47:22.541
Go home. We'll talk about this later.

48:19.458 --> 48:20.958
-Get back.
-I know them.

49:38.458 --> 49:39.541
Colonel Solano.

49:39.625 --> 49:40.666
Where is he?

51:05.333 --> 51:08.666
With respect, Dr. Blake, you had your shot
at funding us and you blew it.

51:08.750 --> 51:11.500
<i>Blew it</i>
<i>We want to shut you down.</i>

51:11.583 --> 51:15.291
Anything now comes from envy
and resentment and is without merit.

51:15.375 --> 51:19.583
<i>What has no merit is your knee-jerk</i>
<i>program based on unproven science,</i>

51:19.666 --> 51:22.458
<i>and your irrational ideas</i>
<i>about forced evolution.</i> <i>You're so desperate to prove it,</i>
<i>you won't admit you dove blindly...</i>

51:25.416 --> 51:29.958
There's nothing blind here.
Either catch up, or stop holding me back.

53:38.333 --> 53:40.750
<i>This isn't space research.</i>

53:40.833 --> 53:42.958
<i>It's criminal, and morally repugnant.</i>

53:43.041 --> 53:45.125
<i>They're becoming violent, losing control.</i>

53:45.208 --> 53:47.541
<i>The last people to try this</i>
<i>were the Nazis.</i>

53:47.625 --> 53:50.083
<i>-You are lying to them.</i>
<i>-</i>Nobody gives a shit!

53:51.500 --> 53:52.875
This is NATO's call.

53:52.958 --> 53:54.541
NASA's just advising.

53:55.625 --> 53:56.958
Let's make it clear.

53:57.541 --> 53:59.458
I want this off my base.

54:00.375 --> 54:02.583
Well, then you better call
Field Marshall Howard at NATO

54:02.666 --> 54:04.750
or the Secretary of Defense
at the Pentagon

54:04.833 --> 54:06.583
because they own your base.

54:33.250 --> 54:35.125
You need to look over Ramos's files.

54:35.208 --> 54:38.083
I have. It's a miracle we got this far.

54:38.166 --> 54:40.833
We have to stop and assess what we've got.
This wasn't in the trials.

54:40.916 --> 54:44.333
What we've got is a fucking roller coaster
of reputation and money.

54:46.250 --> 54:47.333
It'll work...

54:48.541 --> 54:49.708
because it has to.

54:51.250 --> 54:52.625
What if they all die?

54:59.291 --> 55:00.166
Okay.

55:00.250 --> 55:01.291
Off you go.

55:31.083 --> 55:33.166
Your sight will come back in 24 hours.

55:33.708 --> 55:36.708
You will regain your vision
and much, much more.

55:38.041 --> 55:43.000
But we miscalculated your brain's ability
to process your enhanced senses.

55:43.083 --> 55:45.333
Zane's brain just simply overloaded.

55:46.166 --> 55:48.000
-It's surgery.

55:48.083 --> 55:49.500
That's not gonna happen.

55:49.583 --> 55:52.375
-Without it, Rick's brain will--
-Tell me the truth!

55:52.458 --> 55:54.333
-Stop it.
-No! No!

55:55.875 --> 55:57.166
I won't sit here,

55:57.250 --> 56:01.291
and watch him turn my husband
into a fucking animal!

56:08.625 --> 56:11.125
We are in uncharted waters, Abigail.

56:12.250 --> 56:14.166
What are we actually doing here?

56:20.791 --> 56:24.458
During the first treatment,
we injected the subjects with an enzyme

56:25.375 --> 56:26.833
that could alter human DNA.

56:26.916 --> 56:29.333
-Well...

56:29.416 --> 56:33.875
He's giving you a name. Do you know that?
Calling them <i>Homo Titaniens</i>, right?

56:36.541 --> 56:38.458
It's a new species of man, yes.

56:41.000 --> 56:43.125
If these enzymes
are doing the work,

56:43.208 --> 56:44.166
how can you be sure

56:44.250 --> 56:49.000
that his body doesn't just mutate
the eyes out altogether?

56:49.375 --> 56:52.375
Or develop membranes like a reptile?

56:53.125 --> 56:56.583
How can you possibly know
what he's becoming?

56:57.750 --> 56:58.750
We don't know.

57:03.208 --> 57:06.458
Nature is unpredictable.
Everybody evolves in a different way.

57:08.583 --> 57:11.250
But I know for a fact

57:11.958 --> 57:15.166
that if Rick doesn't have surgery,

57:15.250 --> 57:18.958
within 48 hours,
he will lose control of his emotions,

57:19.041 --> 57:21.916
and in 72 hours, he will be dead.

57:27.166 --> 57:30.250
All we can do is move forward...

57:32.291 --> 57:34.500
and hope and pray.

57:50.666 --> 57:52.916
You said the test results were successful.

57:54.250 --> 57:56.416
I said not everybody would survive.

57:57.333 --> 57:58.333
You lied.

57:59.208 --> 58:01.666
I told you what you needed to know
at the time.

58:01.750 --> 58:05.833
You said you would become you, but better.
That's what you said.

58:05.916 --> 58:07.375
And you will.

58:11.291 --> 58:13.041
I have more than hope in you, Rick.

58:16.375 --> 58:17.250
I have faith.

1:00:10.541 --> 1:00:11.541
<i>Hello?</i>

1:00:12.291 --> 1:00:14.083
I can see. I can see everything.

1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:17.333
The night. The sky. There's no darkness.

1:00:23.250 --> 1:00:24.416
I want to finish it.

1:00:57.916 --> 1:01:02.250
<i>"Saturn's largest moon is</i>
<i>the second largest in the solar system.</i>

1:01:02.833 --> 1:01:04.291
Larger than Mercury.

1:01:04.625 --> 1:01:07.541
Its rivers carve valleys into soil rich...

1:01:08.750 --> 1:01:10.666
in ammonia and nitrogen.

1:01:11.916 --> 1:01:13.041
<i>Nitrogen,</i>

1:01:13.625 --> 1:01:16.666
<i>which can be used</i>
<i>to generate breathable oxygen</i>,

1:01:17.791 --> 1:01:21.125
<i>or to produce fertilizer</i>
<i>for growing food."</i>

1:01:48.083 --> 1:01:49.041
Give me adrenaline!

1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:55.083
Hold him down!

1:01:55.791 --> 1:01:57.375
Dr. Wallis!

1:02:12.500 --> 1:02:15.875
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

1:02:20.750 --> 1:02:24.250
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:50.958
<i>We did it, Abi.</i>
<i>We stole fire from the gods.</i>

1:02:53.416 --> 1:02:55.541
<i>Rick and Tally are the future now.</i>

1:02:56.708 --> 1:02:58.041
<i>They leave in two days.</i>

1:04:39.500 --> 1:04:41.750
They communicate
at low frequency.

1:04:42.458 --> 1:04:44.041
And tactile contact.

1:04:45.916 --> 1:04:48.500
Our hearing can't detect it.

1:04:51.125 --> 1:04:53.166
They can go home until we launch.

1:05:08.125 --> 1:05:09.458
It's still him, Abi.

1:05:13.375 --> 1:05:14.291
His ring.

1:05:59.625 --> 1:06:00.583
Let's see.

1:06:02.833 --> 1:06:04.333
Looks like it's...

1:06:04.416 --> 1:06:06.250
Looks like it's just a little tight.

1:06:09.250 --> 1:06:11.166
Might just have to get you a larger size.

1:07:37.250 --> 1:07:38.458
Mom?

1:07:42.500 --> 1:07:44.666
Everything's okay.
Go back to sleep, sweetie.

1:07:44.750 --> 1:07:46.500
Will you turn my stars on?

1:10:22.125 --> 1:10:22.958
Mom?

1:10:37.125 --> 1:10:38.833
Come here. Okay.

1:10:38.916 --> 1:10:40.208
Shh, shh.

1:11:52.583 --> 1:11:54.500
Rick! Rick!

1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:02.250
No!

1:12:32.416 --> 1:12:33.416
Colonel!

1:12:34.041 --> 1:12:35.416
Colonel!

1:12:35.791 --> 1:12:39.000
-He is the property of the U.S. Military.
-He's a threat to life on this base.

1:12:39.083 --> 1:12:43.041
Lieutenant Janssen is $300 million
worth of scientific research.

1:12:43.125 --> 1:12:45.500
-If you kill him...
-I'll do what I have to do.

1:12:54.375 --> 1:12:57.166
Shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

1:12:57.250 --> 1:12:58.250
It's okay, honey.

1:12:58.333 --> 1:13:00.083
It's okay. We're okay.

1:13:05.500 --> 1:13:06.583
I know where he is.

1:13:07.875 --> 1:13:09.416
Stay here. I'll be right back, sweetie.

1:13:53.125 --> 1:13:54.125
Rick!

1:13:56.875 --> 1:13:57.791
Rick!

1:14:00.791 --> 1:14:01.708
Please.

1:14:05.666 --> 1:14:06.833
Please don't run.

1:17:14.666 --> 1:17:15.583
Abi...

1:17:16.458 --> 1:17:17.458
Can you hear me?

1:17:20.833 --> 1:17:21.666
Abi?

1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:26.083
Where am I?

1:17:27.416 --> 1:17:30.708
You mustn't go out on your own again.
We were lucky to find you.

1:17:30.791 --> 1:17:33.583
I'm sorry they hurt you,
but you shouldn't have run.

1:17:33.666 --> 1:17:35.583
Now, Rick's safe, and Lucas.

1:17:36.750 --> 1:17:38.125
But we don't have any time.

1:17:39.250 --> 1:17:40.208
What?

1:17:40.291 --> 1:17:41.958
He's now the future.

1:17:42.625 --> 1:17:45.333
And he's going to survive,
if we can help him.

1:17:45.416 --> 1:17:48.541
But we need to get him on Titan
so he can live.

1:17:49.875 --> 1:17:51.125
We need your help.

1:17:52.041 --> 1:17:55.000
If we force him, I fear we'll kill him.

1:17:56.708 --> 1:17:57.875
Do you understand?

1:18:07.416 --> 1:18:09.958
We need to stabilize him first
or he's not gonna make it.

1:18:10.041 --> 1:18:11.875
The Pentagon's ordered
an immediate evacuation.

1:18:11.958 --> 1:18:15.125
-We have to stabilize him. His vitals...
-We have to leave now!

1:18:22.541 --> 1:18:24.958
Listen. Give me a minute, will you?

1:18:26.583 --> 1:18:27.416
Abigail...

1:18:30.291 --> 1:18:33.250
-If you can make him submit...

1:18:33.333 --> 1:18:37.000
If you can make him take one of these,

1:18:37.083 --> 1:18:39.541
you can end his suffering.

1:18:40.666 --> 1:18:44.333
This is a chemical lobotomy.
You'll erase all of his memories.

1:18:45.166 --> 1:18:46.458
He's resisting...

1:18:48.041 --> 1:18:51.458
because he's attached
to too many things on Earth.

1:18:52.916 --> 1:18:55.500
He won't remember who he is,
he won't remember who I am,

1:18:55.583 --> 1:18:57.333
he won't remember who his son is.

1:18:57.875 --> 1:19:00.083
What good would it do if he did?

1:19:06.125 --> 1:19:07.541
You know he can't stay here.

1:19:08.708 --> 1:19:09.708
He's a soldier.

1:19:10.291 --> 1:19:11.708
There's no going back.

1:19:45.541 --> 1:19:46.916
Be careful, Abigail.

1:22:04.416 --> 1:22:06.250
Let's go. Trust me.

1:22:23.916 --> 1:22:25.416
No! No! Get out!

1:22:37.041 --> 1:22:38.208
What's going on?

1:22:39.708 --> 1:22:41.250
Oh, my God! You switched it!

1:23:03.458 --> 1:23:04.625
Hold it right there!

1:23:11.708 --> 1:23:12.583
Mom?

1:23:22.541 --> 1:23:24.708
There's another way out, through the lab.

1:23:50.791 --> 1:23:51.625
Dad?

1:23:56.000 --> 1:23:56.833
Dad!

1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:01.875
Rick!

1:24:05.333 --> 1:24:07.083
-Let's get you down.
-Okay.

1:24:09.208 --> 1:24:10.333
Be careful.

1:24:21.333 --> 1:24:22.375
Here's something.

1:24:42.833 --> 1:24:43.750
It's over, Abi.

1:24:44.916 --> 1:24:45.916
It's done with.

1:24:48.875 --> 1:24:49.958
They'll shoot...

1:24:51.416 --> 1:24:52.708
and kill your family.

1:24:53.666 --> 1:24:56.125
Just walk away with Lucas.

1:25:01.541 --> 1:25:02.791
Go fuck yourself.

1:25:14.625 --> 1:25:15.541
Shoot them.

1:25:16.791 --> 1:25:17.625
What?

1:25:17.708 --> 1:25:18.666
Shoot them!

1:25:23.750 --> 1:25:24.666
No.

1:25:25.458 --> 1:25:28.291
No, I'm not shooting
two unarmed women and a child.

1:25:29.083 --> 1:25:30.833
Are you losing your minds?

1:25:32.583 --> 1:25:34.000
Look at what we've got!

1:25:34.416 --> 1:25:35.708
That's our research!

1:25:35.791 --> 1:25:37.458
That's what we bled for!

1:25:37.541 --> 1:25:38.666
I made him! I made him!

1:25:41.958 --> 1:25:43.791
But if we can't control him,

1:25:44.416 --> 1:25:45.708
all of us are dead.

1:25:46.541 --> 1:25:47.375
All of us.

1:27:54.791 --> 1:27:56.500
The crazy bastard did it.

1:27:58.458 --> 1:27:59.416
Yeah.

1:28:11.375 --> 1:28:13.000
Rick changes everything.

1:28:14.458 --> 1:28:15.625
He gives us hope.

1:28:17.125 --> 1:28:19.375
Your family's a miracle, Dr. Janssen.

1:29:08.375 --> 1:29:09.291
Hey, Mom.

1:29:09.916 --> 1:29:10.791
Hi.

1:29:12.458 --> 1:29:13.916
-It was great.

1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:15.791
Come outside. It's so clear.
