01:33.334 --> 01:34.952
Gracious!

01:35.022 --> 01:37.709
Maybe next time try
flying under the beehive,

01:37.850 --> 01:39.506
not through it!

01:39.686 --> 01:41.592
Yes. Thank you, Bunga.

01:41.694 --> 01:43.772
So why were you in such a hurry?

01:43.876 --> 01:45.170
I was looking for you.

All of you!

01:46.429 --> 01:47.528
What's the kerbubble, Zazu?

01:47.600 --> 01:49.163
I've just received word.

01:49.225 --> 01:51.905
The pangolins are
spraying everywhere!

01:51.990 --> 01:54.631
It's quite a stinky situation.

01:54.795 --> 01:57.605
Odd. Pangolins only spray
when they're threatened.

01:57.788 --> 01:59.249
Then we better check it out.

02:19.663 --> 02:20.561
I'm sorry.

02:20.597 --> 02:22.358
Can anyone tell me

I don't think they're baboons.

02:52.163 --> 02:55.178
Ugh. They sure act like baboons.

02:55.225 --> 02:56.702
I've never seen
anyone like them.

Well, whatever they are,

03:00.256 --> 03:02.826

03:05.139 --> 03:07.295
Put down the pangolins!

03:07.866 --> 03:09.124
Put them down?

Sure.

03:31.707 --> 03:33.511
So, who are you?

Ah, well, that's easy.

03:38.118 --> 03:42.363
I'm Majinuni, and this
is my brother Hafifu.

We're looking for someone
called King Zimba.

03:45.386 --> 03:46.691
He's a "lion"?

03:46.792 --> 03:48.597
I think they mean Simba.

03:48.683 --> 03:50.464
Yes! That's right!
Do you know him?

03:50.534 --> 03:52.652
Yeah, you could say that.

Kion here just happens
to be his son.

You're a prince?

No, they're princes!

04:05.903 --> 04:07.042
Seriously?

04:07.113 --> 04:09.042
No wonder we've got
so much in common!

04:09.067 --> 04:10.105
We do?

04:10.136 --> 04:13.050
Our poppa sent us here with
a message for your poppa!

04:54.111 --> 04:56.236
Hafifu! Why'd you do that?

04:56.299 --> 04:58.552
Uh, 'cause I wanted
to throw the stick.

04:58.682 --> 05:00.377
Ushari's not a stick!

05:00.423 --> 05:02.221
You just heard him say so!

05:02.318 --> 05:03.900
Uh, he's got a point.

05:03.965 --> 05:05.932
As a rule, sticks don't talk.

Don't know that one.

05:30.674 --> 05:32.041

05:32.104 --> 05:33.893
How could they never
have heard of it?

What is it, son?

06:04.655 --> 06:07.069
Well, we've found these gorilla
brothers who say they...

06:07.144 --> 06:08.483
Have a message for me?

06:08.529 --> 06:10.452
Yes. You know them?

06:10.569 --> 06:13.959
Their father is King Sokwe
of the Mountain Gorillas.

06:14.186 --> 06:17.498
A long time ago, he and
I made a peace treaty.

06:17.709 --> 06:19.702
Now, every wet season,

06:19.827 --> 06:22.311
he sends a message
to let me know

06:22.366 --> 06:24.678
if he still agrees to the peace.

06:24.983 --> 06:25.959
Or not.

So...

an important message for you?

This is not good.

07:08.170 --> 07:12.413
I need you and the Lion Guard
to take the boys back home

07:12.553 --> 07:15.389
and find out what
King Sokwe's message is.

07:15.530 --> 07:18.259
Can't you just send them back
and get the message again?

07:18.327 --> 07:21.202

gorillas depend on them?

should know the way.

Ooh! Chilly!

19:07.417 --> 19:08.662
(EXCLAIMS)

19:13.575 --> 19:14.575
(GASPS)

19:16.345 --> 19:18.111
(GRUNTS)

19:19.338 --> 19:21.248
Kion? Are you okay?

19:21.283 --> 19:22.283
So far!

19:22.317 --> 19:24.117
But I can't hang on long!

19:24.152 --> 19:26.286
(BOTH GRUNTING)

19:26.321 --> 19:27.899
Not helping, Ono!

19:27.938 --> 19:29.189
(GASPS) Sorry!

19:29.224 --> 19:30.457
Whoo-hoo!

19:30.492 --> 19:32.092
Hang on, Kion!

19:32.127 --> 19:33.260
Good advice, brother!

19:33.295 --> 19:34.327
(BOTH GRUNT)

19:35.163 --> 19:36.196
(SCREAMS)

19:36.231 --> 19:37.264
I can't look!

19:37.299 --> 19:38.299
(GRUNTS)

19:40.369 --> 19:42.803
(PANTS) You saved me.

19:43.069 --> 19:44.120
Thanks.

19:44.170 --> 19:46.139
Pfft! No thanks needed.

19:46.210 --> 19:47.538
It was fun!

19:47.639 --> 19:50.184
Oh no! It was more than that.

19:50.279 --> 19:51.520
It was brave.

19:51.613 --> 19:53.899
Doing something like that
is what you makes you

19:53.992 --> 19:55.242
prince material.

19:56.351 --> 19:58.351
You really think
we have that in us?

19:58.500 --> 19:59.703
The prince thing?

19:59.838 --> 20:01.371
Totally.

20:02.571 --> 20:03.922
SOKWE: So...

20:04.036 --> 20:07.304
You forgot my message
to King Simba!

20:07.539 --> 20:08.938
BOTH: Yes, Poppa.

20:09.117 --> 20:13.433
And you got lost coming home
from the Pride Lands!

20:13.546 --> 20:15.187
BOTH: Yes, Poppa.

20:15.370 --> 20:20.507
And you needed the Lion Guard
to help you get back home!

20:20.578 --> 20:22.070
BOTH: Yes, Poppa.

20:22.162 --> 20:25.929
You know what this means.

20:26.080 --> 20:27.570
BOTH: Yes, Poppa.

20:27.749 --> 20:29.124
(SOFTLY) What do
you think it means?

20:29.188 --> 20:30.765
Nothing too bad, I hope.

20:34.749 --> 20:39.617
<i>Kuishi ni kucheka!</i> (LAUGHING)

20:39.812 --> 20:42.395
(BOTH LAUGHING)

20:42.431 --> 20:44.531
SOKWE: Kion told me
how you saved him.

20:44.674 --> 20:47.026
I'm proud of you both.

20:47.156 --> 20:50.323
You are true gorilla princes.

20:50.740 --> 20:52.006
BOTH: Thank you, Poppa.

20:52.108 --> 20:55.379
Um, speaking of your
message for my dad?

20:55.477 --> 20:57.510
We do need to give it to him.

20:57.608 --> 21:00.193
Of course you do. (LAUGHS)

21:00.306 --> 21:05.076
I see your friend has
a souvenir from our home.

21:05.220 --> 21:06.319
Sure do!

21:06.355 --> 21:09.065
Uh... Your Gorilla-ness!

21:09.142 --> 21:10.572
Is that's a problem?

21:10.604 --> 21:11.823
No, no.

21:11.893 --> 21:13.159
Not at all.

21:13.228 --> 21:15.643
In fact, it's perfect.

21:17.366 --> 21:18.799
KION: And, so...

21:18.995 --> 21:20.034
Here we are.

21:20.098 --> 21:24.304
And did you bring back
King Sokwe's message?

21:24.635 --> 21:26.557
Uh, yeah...

21:26.642 --> 21:27.838
Well, then?

21:27.924 --> 21:29.103
It's just...

21:29.188 --> 21:31.299
Kion? I need the message.

21:31.471 --> 21:32.572
Are you sure?

21:32.627 --> 21:34.381
Yes! You have to give it to me!

21:34.416 --> 21:35.603
Okay...

21:35.736 --> 21:37.463
<i>Kuishi ni kucheka!</i>

21:41.017 --> 21:42.287
(GRUNTS)

21:42.877 --> 21:44.135
Sorry, Your Majesty.

21:44.197 --> 21:45.697
It really wasn't my idea.

21:45.814 --> 21:48.161
(SING-SONG VOICE) This
might have been a mistake.

21:49.189 --> 21:50.557
(CHUCKLES)

21:50.689 --> 21:52.619
Oh, King Sokwe.

21:52.736 --> 21:55.705
No one delivers a peace
message like him.

21:56.345 --> 21:58.155
