00:00.341 --> 00:04.547
<i>- Previously on The Tudors...</i>
- In this realm, there should
be perfect love.

00:04.582 --> 00:08.251
But instead, there is discord
and dissention in every place.

00:08.319 --> 00:11.154
I will see these divisions
extinct. It doesn't seem
to matter who I talk to

00:11.255 --> 00:16.259
at court. All about me now
is guile, hypocrisy,
and dishonesty.

00:16.327 --> 00:20.063
- I fear now, more than ever,
the plots and plans swirl about
the court and the King.

00:20.097 --> 00:24.434
Men conspire to secure their own
future and their own profits--
By controlling the Prince.

00:24.568 --> 00:27.136
- My poor brother is being
brought up a Protestant
and a heretic.

00:27.238 --> 00:29.906
And the King does nothing
to stop it.

00:29.974 --> 00:32.976
- I have written a book.
- You call the Pope's
clergy riff-Raff.

00:33.077 --> 00:34.911
- Bishop Gardiner has arrested

00:34.979 --> 00:37.914
my sister and two of my ladies
on suspicion of heresy.

00:37.982 --> 00:40.483
- We have discovered
certain books.

00:40.584 --> 00:44.454
In the closets
of the Queen's ladies.

00:44.488 --> 00:48.157
- Your Majesty has begun a great
work, banishing the monstrous
idol of Rome.

00:48.292 --> 00:50.460
You can finish that work

00:50.494 --> 00:52.929
by purging the Church
of England of its dregs.

00:52.997 --> 00:56.699
- Majesty, many of the greatest
subjects in the land-

00:56.767 --> 01:00.637
-defending those same arguments
have deserved death.

01:00.704 --> 01:03.306
- I cannot believe that you
would accuse the Queen
of heresy.

01:03.374 --> 01:07.108
- I have the proof.

02:30.094 --> 02:32.429
- When we compare the present
life of man on earth

02:32.463 --> 02:35.299
with that time of which we have
no knowledge,

02:35.400 --> 02:38.669
it seems to me like
the swift flight

02:38.770 --> 02:41.438
of a single sparrow through
a banqueting hall

02:41.472 --> 02:44.107
on a winter's day.

02:44.242 --> 02:46.610
After a few moments
of comfort,

02:46.678 --> 02:49.947
he vanishes from sight into the
wintry world from which he came.

02:51.950 --> 02:56.420
Even so, man appears on earth
for a little while;

02:56.487 --> 03:00.424
but of what went before this
life or what will follow,

03:00.458 --> 03:03.493
we know nothing.

03:06.464 --> 03:08.632
In these last days

03:08.700 --> 03:11.535
I have been thinking a great
deal about loss.

03:11.603 --> 03:14.438
What loss, Your Grace,

03:14.505 --> 03:16.373
is to man the most
irrecoverable?

03:16.441 --> 03:19.309
- His virtue.
- No.

03:19.377 --> 03:21.945
For by his actions,
he may redeem his virtue.

03:22.046 --> 03:25.782
- Then his honor.
- No. For again,

03:25.850 --> 03:28.685
he may find
the means to recover it,

03:28.753 --> 03:31.154
even as a man recovers some
fortune he has lost.

03:31.222 --> 03:35.192
- Then I cannot say,
Your Majesty.

03:35.293 --> 03:38.962
- Time, Your Grace.

03:39.030 --> 03:41.498
Of all losses,

03:41.633 --> 03:44.134
time is the most
irrecuperable,

03:44.235 --> 03:47.104
for it can never
be redeemed.

04:04.455 --> 04:06.556
- Walter!

04:10.628 --> 04:14.698
Take this very carefully
and give it

04:14.766 --> 04:17.668
to my Lord Risley.

04:17.802 --> 04:21.338
- Yes, Your Grace.

04:25.643 --> 04:28.512
- The Lord High Admiral
of France.

04:36.020 --> 04:37.988
- Your Majesty.

04:40.525 --> 04:44.494
<i>- Salutationes Domine,
Praefectus Magnus Galliae.</i>

04:44.529 --> 04:46.697
<i>Salvete Regis Enrici</i>

04:46.831 --> 04:48.999
<i>octavi maiestatis.</i>

04:53.705 --> 04:56.940
- Thank you, Your Highness.

04:57.041 --> 05:00.177
It is my great privilege
and honor to be here.

05:00.211 --> 05:03.246
- My Lord Admiral.
- Madame.

05:03.381 --> 05:05.782
- May I present

05:05.883 --> 05:10.120
His Majesty's daughters-the Lady
Mary and the Lady Elizabeth.

05:10.221 --> 05:13.056
- EnchantÃ©. I never thought
to be welcomed

05:13.191 --> 05:15.292
in this cordial way by His
Majesty's family.

05:15.393 --> 05:17.527
Ah, but you are
a very special

05:17.562 --> 05:20.764
and honored guest,
Admiral D'Annibault.

05:20.865 --> 05:23.233
And your visit most timely.

05:23.368 --> 05:25.702
I am sure His Majesty will
be here presently.

05:33.778 --> 05:36.413
- My Lord Hertford seems
to be in the King's good graces.

05:36.547 --> 05:39.149
- I fear it seems to be so.

05:39.250 --> 05:41.151
The Earl grows more powerful

05:41.252 --> 05:43.754
daily because
of the King's infirmity

05:43.821 --> 05:46.490
and his control
of the boy.

05:46.591 --> 05:49.493
- God help us then
if the King should die.

05:49.594 --> 05:51.495
- Yes.

05:53.431 --> 05:55.565
But I have heard many say

05:55.600 --> 05:57.968
that the people would rather
see you anointed as Queen

05:58.069 --> 06:02.105
than leave the country

06:02.173 --> 06:05.409
at the mercy of a mere child

06:05.443 --> 06:08.245
and an overweening uncle.

06:08.279 --> 06:11.148
- And what
of the Queen?

06:11.249 --> 06:14.584
- Ah-you shall hear more
on that subject...

06:14.719 --> 06:16.520
... very soon.

06:16.587 --> 06:20.757
- The King!

06:25.329 --> 06:27.664
- Your Majesty.

06:44.115 --> 06:45.949
- Admiral.

06:46.083 --> 06:50.787
We are very pleased to make
a new treaty with France.

06:53.257 --> 06:55.492
I will have no further business
with the Emperor-

06:55.593 --> 07:00.096
who has betrayed
me at every turn.

07:00.131 --> 07:01.598
- I can assure Your Majesty that
you will find us

07:01.632 --> 07:05.035
good and faithful friends...
unlike the Emperor.

07:05.136 --> 07:07.637
- As you know,

07:07.672 --> 07:11.508
in my kingdom I have made many
changes to religious life.

07:11.609 --> 07:15.712
I have reformed
a corrupt church.

07:15.813 --> 07:18.982
I have swept aside
hundreds of years

07:19.050 --> 07:22.052
of lies and superstitions.

07:22.153 --> 07:24.754
I have revealed to all mankind

07:24.856 --> 07:27.324
that the Pope
is but a fallible prince,

07:27.425 --> 07:30.193
and not the voice of God.

07:30.294 --> 07:34.030
All this, no doubt,
you'll have heard.

07:34.131 --> 07:36.299
- I am certainly aware that Your
Majesty has wrought

07:36.367 --> 07:39.135
many changes-
in your own kingdom.

07:41.272 --> 07:44.474
- Well, if we are going
to be allies, Monsieur,

07:44.542 --> 07:46.810
then I propose
a further change.

07:46.878 --> 07:50.814
I propose that Mass
be abolished

07:50.915 --> 07:56.620
in both our realms-and replaced
with a simple communion service.

07:56.721 --> 08:01.224
Now, how would
you feel about that?

08:06.297 --> 08:10.166
- Your Majesty, I have
no authority to renegotiate
the terms of our treaty-

08:10.201 --> 08:13.169
especially, as Your Majesty
knows, my King is dying.

08:13.237 --> 08:16.339
- Of syphilis,
I know.

08:16.374 --> 08:19.142
I am very sorry to hear it.

08:19.176 --> 08:21.144
I have known Francis
a long time,

08:21.178 --> 08:24.881
and I beg you
to send him my love.

08:24.949 --> 08:27.651
But you may also tell him

08:27.718 --> 08:31.054
that his disease is a reminder
of his own mortality!

08:31.188 --> 08:35.158
Which, in times past,
he has forgotten!

08:45.269 --> 08:48.838
- Walter?
- I have something
for you to show the Queen.

08:48.873 --> 08:52.175
I'm supposed to take
it to Lord Risley.

08:52.209 --> 08:54.711
Hide it. When the Queen's read
it, give it back to me.

08:54.779 --> 08:59.616
- -so handsome.
- Oh, hush, sister.

08:59.717 --> 09:04.254
What is it?

09:16.133 --> 09:18.268
Oh my God.

09:21.606 --> 09:23.573
- What is that?

09:23.608 --> 09:26.276
Who is it?

09:26.377 --> 09:30.080
- It's... it's the Queen's
Majesty, Your Majesty.

09:30.147 --> 09:34.551
- And why is she screaming
like that?

09:38.623 --> 09:40.757
I'll go and see her.

09:51.002 --> 09:54.971
Kate-what is it?

10:10.421 --> 10:14.257
- I...

10:14.291 --> 10:16.493
I fear...

10:16.594 --> 10:18.795
you have grown
displeased with me.

10:18.863 --> 10:21.831
- Why so?

10:26.303 --> 10:30.607
- Because...

10:30.675 --> 10:32.609
I fear that you have...

10:32.677 --> 10:35.412
utterly forsaken me.

10:38.249 --> 10:40.617
- I don't understand.

10:40.685 --> 10:43.620
What has caused you to think so?

10:43.688 --> 10:47.724
Why would I have reason
to be displeased with yo5?

10:58.703 --> 11:03.540
- Are you not
displeased with me?

11:03.607 --> 11:06.309
- Kate,

11:06.343 --> 11:08.478
I will ask you

11:08.512 --> 11:11.481
is there any reason
I should be?

11:19.356 --> 11:24.494
- No. There is none,
your Majesty.

11:27.665 --> 11:29.899
- Good day, my Lady.

11:37.575 --> 11:42.846
- Sister! Ladies!
Now, you must do as I ask.

11:42.913 --> 11:45.248
Clear your coffers
of all books-

11:45.349 --> 11:48.718
whether you suppose them to be
forbidden or not! From now
on we shall talk

11:48.819 --> 11:52.555
no more, amongst ourselves, of
any matters, whether religious

11:52.656 --> 11:56.893
or controversial,
and I shall try, in all things,

11:56.994 --> 12:00.196
to conform myself
to the King's mind. Now go.

12:00.231 --> 12:02.799
Hurry!

12:04.401 --> 12:07.337
- My Lord Hertford.
- Mademoiselle-

12:07.404 --> 12:10.106
good day.

12:10.207 --> 12:12.075
May I be presented
to His Grace?

12:12.176 --> 12:16.212
- Alas, my Lord,
His Grace is indisposed.

12:16.247 --> 12:18.748
He caught a chill
and is still abed.

12:18.849 --> 12:22.218
- I am very sorry
to hear it.

12:22.253 --> 12:24.521
I will return some other time,
when the Duke is well.

12:24.588 --> 12:27.223
- No, no, my Lord.

12:27.258 --> 12:30.927
I am well enough
to see you.

12:31.028 --> 12:33.463
<i>- Que fais-tu?</i>

12:33.564 --> 12:37.300
<i>- Ne t'inquiÃ¨te pas,
ma Cherie. Je vais bien.</i>

12:37.401 --> 12:40.737
My Lord.

12:47.745 --> 12:50.180
I think your faction
is engaged

12:50.247 --> 12:53.416
in a fight to the death
with Bishop Gardiner and his.

12:55.419 --> 12:57.420
- I will not hide the truth
from you, Your Grace.

12:57.521 --> 13:00.857
The King's infirmity

13:00.925 --> 13:03.593
and the youth of my nephew

13:03.627 --> 13:06.896
make the question
of succession urgent.

13:06.964 --> 13:10.533
The stakes could not possibly
be higher.

13:10.601 --> 13:13.469
- And you desire
to know, I assume,

13:13.571 --> 13:15.872
on which side
of the argument I belong?

13:15.940 --> 13:21.311
- Your Grace,
whether you will it or not,

13:21.412 --> 13:24.881
you carry a great weight
of confidence and influence
with the King.

13:24.982 --> 13:27.283
And everyone knows that.

13:27.351 --> 13:29.319
But fewer people know
that your wife, the Duchess,

13:29.420 --> 13:32.088
and my wife Anne,
together with the Queen,

13:32.156 --> 13:35.592
are as close on matters
of religion as it is
possible to be.

13:35.659 --> 13:38.461
And this
close affinity has

13:38.495 --> 13:42.031
emboldened me, now,
to approach Your Grace.

13:42.099 --> 13:44.100
- Surely your wife
has told you

13:44.168 --> 13:47.103
that the Duchess
and I are estranged!

13:47.171 --> 13:51.007
Thus her affinities
are not necessarily my own

13:51.108 --> 13:54.244
and you do me a disservice
to assume they are.

13:54.278 --> 13:56.779
-our Grace, forgive me...

14:01.785 --> 14:06.623
- I do forgive you. I forgive
you even for hounding poor,

14:06.690 --> 14:09.792
proud Surrey
to his death-

14:09.894 --> 14:13.796
for it was his fault.

14:13.864 --> 14:17.133
But as to religion.

14:17.167 --> 14:19.836
I have never read the
Gospels-and never shall.

14:19.937 --> 14:22.038
I am sure they enlighten you,

14:22.139 --> 14:24.073
but I prefer them
to remain mysterious.

14:24.141 --> 14:27.243
And, as for the promise
of a better world,

14:27.311 --> 14:30.446
I can only say that England
was merry before,

14:30.514 --> 14:34.617
and all things considered,

14:34.652 --> 14:36.152
I would all things
were as they used to be

14:36.220 --> 14:39.355
in times past.

14:43.260 --> 14:45.995
- Your Grace, if I do not have
your support-

14:46.130 --> 14:50.600
may I ask if you will act
against me?

14:50.701 --> 14:54.837
- I'm not sure if this is any
answer, my Lord Hertford.

14:54.939 --> 14:58.641
But I have always been drawn
to a phrase used by the

14:58.742 --> 15:02.312
"Praise the God of all,

15:02.346 --> 15:04.847
"drink the wine,

15:04.949 --> 15:08.117
"and let the world
be the world."

15:15.059 --> 15:19.395
- Lady Hertford,
Your Grace.

15:19.496 --> 15:21.364
- My Lady Hertford.

15:21.465 --> 15:23.800
- Your Grace,

15:23.867 --> 15:26.836
I was summoned
here but I have no idea why.

15:26.870 --> 15:29.205
I wonder how I may help you?

15:29.340 --> 15:33.910
- You may help me, my Lady,
by telling me the truth.

15:34.011 --> 15:37.146
You were a friend,
I believe,

15:37.214 --> 15:41.484
of the heretic Anne Askew,
recently burned?

15:41.518 --> 15:45.221
- I was acquainted
with her.

15:45.322 --> 15:48.157
- You were more
than acquainted, I think.

15:48.192 --> 15:52.161
While she was a prisoner one
of your servants- a man
wearing a blue coat-

15:52.262 --> 15:56.199
gave her money.

15:56.266 --> 15:58.701
- I desired to make her
circumstances more tolerable.

15:58.769 --> 16:02.405
I was only acting
out of Christian charity.

16:02.506 --> 16:05.875
I had been informed
that those who tortured her,

16:05.909 --> 16:09.145
illegally, had stretched
her on the rack

16:09.213 --> 16:12.348
until the strings of her arms
and legs were perished.

16:12.416 --> 16:14.817
- But you admit

16:14.918 --> 16:17.320
she was a self-confessed
heretic?

16:17.421 --> 16:21.190
You are therefore guilty
by association.

16:21.258 --> 16:24.494
- You have a warrant
for my arrest?

16:37.274 --> 16:42.211
You will never
serve that warrant.

16:42.246 --> 16:44.747
- Why not?

16:44.848 --> 16:47.116
- Because
I know your secret.

16:47.184 --> 16:51.854
- What secret, my Lady Hertford?

16:51.922 --> 16:54.424
- You are not such
a saint as you appe-

16:54.491 --> 16:58.027
are you, Your Grace?
You have not exactly

16:58.095 --> 17:02.265
renounced worldly goods-
have you?

17:04.334 --> 17:06.234
There are two monasteries
in Cornwall.

17:06.336 --> 17:09.539
They were stripped and closed,
on His Majesty's orders,
and burnt.

17:09.606 --> 17:14.343
Except that they were neither
stripped nor burnt,

17:14.444 --> 17:17.646
but their titles and contents
were quietly transferred

17:17.714 --> 17:24.987
to Your Grace.
Thus you are a rich man indeed-

17:25.089 --> 17:27.924
but only by embezzling
from the King.

17:28.025 --> 17:32.061
I advise you to tear
up your warrant,

17:32.129 --> 17:34.864
Your Grace.

18:02.459 --> 18:05.595
- Majesty, Her Majesty
the Queen.

18:12.469 --> 18:16.105
- Kate. Come in here.

18:21.445 --> 18:23.846
- Your Majesty.

18:33.924 --> 18:35.992
- I am glad you have come.

18:36.093 --> 18:40.096
You can resolve
me of certain doubts.

18:40.130 --> 18:42.832
I wonder, Kate,
how much you think

18:42.933 --> 18:44.567
you can learn
from reading the Gospels

18:44.601 --> 18:47.470
and other
religious books?

18:47.538 --> 18:49.172
- Majesty,

18:49.273 --> 18:52.909
since God has appointed
you as Supreme Head of us all,

18:53.010 --> 18:56.579
it is from you
that I will ever learn.

18:56.613 --> 18:59.782
- Ah, but that surely
is not so!

18:59.850 --> 19:02.451
You have become
a doctor, Kate,

19:02.586 --> 19:06.455
to instruct us-as we have seen
many times before-

19:06.490 --> 19:09.759
but not to be instructed
or directed by us!

19:12.429 --> 19:14.997
- Majesty, I think my meaning
has been mistaken

19:15.132 --> 19:17.133
for I have always
held it preposterous

19:17.167 --> 19:19.202
for a woman
to instruct her Lord.

19:19.303 --> 19:21.204
- And yet,

19:21.305 --> 19:23.639
you seem sometimes
to have a different view

19:23.707 --> 19:26.142
of religion than we do.

19:26.210 --> 19:28.644
- Only so that you could
correct me!

19:28.712 --> 19:32.014
Forgive me, Your Majesty,
but I thought

19:32.149 --> 19:36.185
that talking and discussing
helped to ease

19:36.320 --> 19:39.956
the pain and weariness
of your present infirmity.

19:39.990 --> 19:43.125
And it encouraged
me in my boldness,

19:43.193 --> 19:45.828
in the hope of profiting

19:45.896 --> 19:49.031
from your learned discourse.

19:49.132 --> 19:54.303
I am, I am but a woman,

19:54.338 --> 19:58.908
with all the imperfections
natural

19:59.009 --> 20:02.011
to the weakness of my sex;

20:02.079 --> 20:06.482
and therefore, in all matters
of doubt and difficulty

20:06.516 --> 20:09.986
I must refer myself

20:10.053 --> 20:12.221
to Your Majesty's better
judgment,

20:12.322 --> 20:17.360
as my Lord and head.

20:21.198 --> 20:23.032
- Is that so,
sweetheart?

20:23.166 --> 20:27.536
And you made your argument
for no worse ends?

20:27.604 --> 20:32.708
Then we are perfect
friends again.

20:37.781 --> 20:40.283
- I thank Your Majesty.

20:48.225 --> 20:50.126
- I promise

20:50.227 --> 20:54.597
that I will never doubt
you again.

20:59.770 --> 21:01.704
Sweet Kate.

21:01.772 --> 21:05.408
- Majesty.

21:15.285 --> 21:18.421
- Majesty, shall I rescind Your
Majesty's order

21:18.555 --> 21:20.423
to arrest
the Queen tomorrow?

21:20.490 --> 21:23.426
- Why?

21:27.431 --> 21:29.665
Music.

21:29.766 --> 21:32.068
âª

21:38.308 --> 21:40.910
- What is it,
sweetheart?

21:40.977 --> 21:43.679
- Nothing.

21:43.780 --> 21:46.615
I was dreaming.

21:48.685 --> 21:51.087
We were back in Boulogne -

21:51.154 --> 21:54.323
but I let you go.

21:56.493 --> 21:58.928
- I'm here.

22:02.632 --> 22:05.701
- Has the dawn come yet?
- Not yet. Not yet.

22:12.509 --> 22:14.977
- I hate the nights.

22:15.112 --> 22:17.346
They make you think
of perpetual night.

22:17.447 --> 22:19.882
- Hush, darling.

22:19.983 --> 22:23.652
The dawn will be here soon,
and you well again.

22:32.763 --> 22:35.531
- Brigitte...
- Yes, my darling?

22:35.665 --> 22:39.702
- I'm so happy.

22:57.854 --> 22:59.989
- Kate...?
- What is this...?

23:05.796 --> 23:08.097
- Lord Chancellor!
Why have you come?

23:08.198 --> 23:12.101
- I have come to execute the
warrant for the Queen's arrest

23:12.202 --> 23:14.837
and to escort her,
and her Ladies, to the Tower.

23:14.871 --> 23:17.506
- You knave!

23:17.574 --> 23:20.109
You arrant knave!

23:20.210 --> 23:23.279
Get out!
Get out of my sight!

23:23.380 --> 23:24.847
- Your Majesty, forgive me--
- GET OUT!

23:24.881 --> 23:27.683
And take your bastards
with you.

23:36.960 --> 23:39.228
- I... I am sorry

23:39.262 --> 23:41.397
the Lord Chavcellor should

23:41.465 --> 23:45.267
make such a mistake.

23:45.368 --> 23:48.070
- You don't how little

23:48.138 --> 23:50.906
he deserves
your sympathy.

23:50.974 --> 23:55.277
He was not
your friend Kate.

24:06.623 --> 24:08.757
- Lord Hertford!
- My Lord Hertford!

24:11.895 --> 24:14.530
- Your Grace,
I have already explained,

24:14.598 --> 24:16.765
he called me a knave!
All manner of things.

24:16.900 --> 24:19.068
- But for whose ears?

24:19.102 --> 24:23.472
Supposing he still wants the
Queen to feel falsely secure?

24:23.573 --> 24:27.243
- If it was feigned anger,
it seemed very real to me!

24:29.412 --> 24:32.815
My Lords, in the King'sbsence,
Council is called upon

24:32.916 --> 24:35.384
to declare its content
with the terms

24:35.452 --> 24:39.221
of the peace treaty with France.
All in favour say "aye"

24:39.256 --> 24:41.457
- Aye.
- Council is also

24:41.591 --> 24:44.460
called upon to discuss
all arrangements made

24:44.561 --> 24:47.897
for the security and safety
of His Highness Prince Edward,

24:47.931 --> 24:49.798
heir to the throne,

24:49.900 --> 24:52.268
and all provisions
made for his temporal

24:52.335 --> 24:54.970
and spiritual welfare.

24:55.071 --> 24:58.941
- My Lords, pray,

24:58.975 --> 25:01.377
what induces you to discuss
such things now,

25:01.444 --> 25:03.746
when all such provisions
are already made

25:03.780 --> 25:05.180
and the Prince
is secure at Windsor,

25:05.282 --> 25:08.117
by His Majesty's orders?
- Aye.

25:08.251 --> 25:10.019
- My Lord Hertford,

25:10.120 --> 25:13.188
Council is still constituted

25:13.256 --> 25:15.291
to examine such matters...
especially since

25:15.358 --> 25:17.860
the King's infirmities give us

25:17.961 --> 25:19.662
all cause to think
of the future.

25:19.796 --> 25:22.831
- And it is treason,

25:22.899 --> 25:25.601
my Lord Chancellor,
to envisage the King's death!

25:25.635 --> 25:27.603
- Aye!
- My Lord, all our concern

25:27.637 --> 25:30.639
is for the Prince.
- Your concern?!

25:30.707 --> 25:33.475
Are you forgetting
that he is of my blood?

25:33.543 --> 25:36.845
- He is also
of the King's blood,

25:36.947 --> 25:40.316
which gives us cause enough
to examine those put
in charge of him.

25:40.383 --> 25:42.651
And among them,
some of whom we find,

25:42.719 --> 25:46.722
like his tutors,
to be suspected heretics!

25:46.823 --> 25:49.391
- You talk
of heresy! You!

25:49.492 --> 25:53.395
And what are you but a puffed-up
porkling of the Pope's?

25:53.496 --> 25:56.565
- My Lord!

25:56.666 --> 26:00.369
- I still say-
my Lord Hertford-

26:00.470 --> 26:03.405
that the real truth behind
your intentions

26:03.506 --> 26:05.574
towards the Prince
and the crown

26:05.675 --> 26:08.210
must be placed before
the King.

26:11.915 --> 26:14.149
- What are you doing?
Take your hands off!

26:19.255 --> 26:22.558
- Your Majesty,
Bishop Gardiner desires

26:22.659 --> 26:24.893
an audience
with your Majesty.

26:24.961 --> 26:27.896
- Refused.

26:27.998 --> 26:31.033
His Grace
has a troublesome nature

26:31.167 --> 26:33.769
and I don't want
to see him here ever again.

26:33.870 --> 26:37.072
I desire him
to leave my court.

26:37.173 --> 26:42.711
- Yes, Your Majesty.

26:49.352 --> 26:52.788
Your Grace, His Majesty
instructs you to leave court.

27:45.942 --> 27:48.343
- My Lord Hertford.
- Lord Hertford.

27:48.445 --> 27:49.611
- Lord Hertford.

27:49.679 --> 27:52.614
- My Lord Hertford.

27:52.682 --> 27:55.984
- Lord Chancellor.
What may I do for you?

27:56.086 --> 27:59.755
- You may forgive me, if you
find it possible to do so,

27:59.789 --> 28:02.691
from some past associations,
which I now regret.

28:02.792 --> 28:05.694
I have no hesitation
in pledging my utter loyalty

28:05.795 --> 28:09.098
to Your Lordship's house,

28:09.132 --> 28:11.767
and I trust in future
I can serve you

28:11.835 --> 28:15.471
as faithfully as I have
always served His Majesty.

28:15.572 --> 28:20.943
- I am most grateful to you,
my Lord Chancellor.

28:39.729 --> 28:44.066
- Your Majesty-Mr. Holbein.

28:52.675 --> 28:54.777
- Mr. Holbein.
- Majesty.

28:54.844 --> 28:57.346
- I have
a commission for you.

28:57.413 --> 29:00.149
- I am most grateful
to Your Majesty.

29:00.216 --> 29:03.886
I assume Your Majesty
means a portrait?

29:03.987 --> 29:06.722
- You once
painted my father.

29:06.823 --> 29:09.324
Now you will paint me.

29:09.425 --> 29:13.028
- I am deeply honored.

29:16.099 --> 29:18.333
- Sweetheart,

29:18.368 --> 29:20.335
sweetheart-

29:20.370 --> 29:23.205
here is a messenger
from His Majesty.

29:30.547 --> 29:33.215
- Your Grace,

29:33.283 --> 29:36.218
His Majesty has heard
of your indisposition

29:36.252 --> 29:38.887
and has asked
to see you.

29:41.291 --> 29:43.692
- No! That is impossible.

29:43.726 --> 29:46.295
Ask the physicians.

29:50.466 --> 29:52.734
- What shall
I tell His Majesty?

29:52.802 --> 29:56.572
- Tell him- I shall come.

29:56.673 --> 29:58.907
- But you can't!

29:58.975 --> 30:03.412
- How can I lie
in bed, my love,

30:03.446 --> 30:05.714
when the King of England
has summoned me?

30:05.748 --> 30:10.052
Just get
them to help me.

31:01.905 --> 31:04.172
- What are
you doing here?

31:04.274 --> 31:07.843
- I have come
to see my daughter.

31:07.944 --> 31:10.846
Why should that
surprise you, Henry?

31:12.849 --> 31:15.851
You have not always
been kind to her.

31:15.952 --> 31:18.620
I have wept so often

31:18.655 --> 31:20.789
to see her alone,

31:20.857 --> 31:25.260
abandoned by her father.

31:25.328 --> 31:30.499
- Is that why you've come back,
Katherine,

31:30.600 --> 31:35.370
to chide me for all
that I am not?

31:35.471 --> 31:39.274
- She ought to be a long
time married by now.

31:39.342 --> 31:42.277
She ought to have
her own children.

31:45.481 --> 31:48.450
- Go away, shade.

31:48.518 --> 31:51.954
Go away, Katherine.

31:53.589 --> 31:56.625
- You sent me away before-

31:56.693 --> 31:59.761
though I loved you.

31:59.862 --> 32:04.666
But I was still
your wife in God's eyes.

32:04.734 --> 32:08.036
And still am.

32:31.794 --> 32:34.396
- His Grace the Duke
of Suffolk.

32:50.646 --> 32:52.881
- Charles.

32:52.982 --> 32:56.718
- Majesty.

32:56.819 --> 32:59.221
- They told me you were ill.

32:59.322 --> 33:01.923
So I had to see you.

33:04.527 --> 33:06.561
- I have a slight fever.

33:08.931 --> 33:12.734
Perhaps Your Majesty should
not come so close.

33:12.835 --> 33:16.872
- We've known each other

33:17.006 --> 33:21.109
a long time,
a very long time.

33:21.210 --> 33:24.579
- Yes.

33:24.680 --> 33:26.681
And I remember
everything.

33:29.619 --> 33:33.422
In fact, I remember

33:33.556 --> 33:35.957
things from long ago

33:36.059 --> 33:39.061
better than I remember
yesterday.

33:44.100 --> 33:45.967
I remember Your Majesty's
sister so well.

33:50.473 --> 33:53.241
And the Battle
of the Spurs!

33:56.979 --> 33:58.947
And when Your Majesty
made me a Duke-

34:03.619 --> 34:06.421
God knows why!

34:08.424 --> 34:10.891
- You were my general,

34:10.927 --> 34:13.795
in York and in France,

34:13.929 --> 34:16.931
because I could trust
no one else.

34:20.168 --> 34:22.437
And I beg you now Charles,

34:22.472 --> 34:24.438
to trust me.

34:29.978 --> 34:32.414
I have the power
to make you well again;

34:32.514 --> 34:35.016
you know that.

34:39.355 --> 34:41.922
They told me you were
like to die-

34:41.991 --> 34:45.293
but you won't die.

34:45.328 --> 34:48.530
I forbid it!

34:48.630 --> 34:50.632
Kneel.

35:11.120 --> 35:12.988
By the grace of God,

35:13.122 --> 35:16.725
I, the Eighth Henry-

35:16.826 --> 35:20.462
King of England,
Ireland, and France-

35:20.530 --> 35:24.166
Defender of the Faith

35:24.233 --> 35:26.835
and of the Church of England

35:26.903 --> 35:29.838
command you
to be healed!

36:31.367 --> 36:34.102
- My Lady Suffolk.
- My Lady.

36:37.740 --> 36:41.042
- Your Grace.
May I say,

36:41.110 --> 36:44.045
on behalf of all His Grace's
loyal servants and staff,

36:44.080 --> 36:46.648
that we are as heart-broken
and wretched

36:46.749 --> 36:49.284
as Your Grace must
be on this unhappy day.

36:49.385 --> 36:53.255
For we all loved
His Grace as much as you,

36:53.322 --> 36:55.857
his wife,
and son, loved him.

36:55.925 --> 36:57.692
- Thank you.

36:57.793 --> 37:00.395
Your sympathy and loyalty touch
my son and I most deeply.

37:06.435 --> 37:08.470
- Madame.

37:21.350 --> 37:23.418
<i>- Requiescant
in pace Domini.</i>

37:23.486 --> 37:26.021
<i>Et Lux perpetua
luceat eis.</i>

37:26.122 --> 37:30.125
<i>Requiescant in pace.</i>

37:39.268 --> 37:42.370
He is to be buried at
St George's Chapel at Windsor.

37:42.471 --> 37:45.807
At my expense.

37:45.908 --> 37:49.010
- Majesty.

37:49.111 --> 37:52.213
- I tell you this,

37:52.281 --> 37:56.651
as long as Charles Brandon
served me,

37:56.752 --> 38:00.021
he never betrayed a friend,

38:00.122 --> 38:02.257
nor ever...

38:02.325 --> 38:04.726
took unfair advantage
of an enemy.

38:07.663 --> 38:11.766
Which is more than I can say
for anyone else at my court!

38:15.838 --> 38:18.740
I never thought
he would die.

38:23.279 --> 38:25.447
We should talk,
my Lord Hertford,

38:25.481 --> 38:28.183
about the arrangements
for the Prince's minority...

38:28.250 --> 38:30.952
after I am dead!

38:44.233 --> 38:46.568
- Your Majesty,
Mr. Holbein is here.

38:48.637 --> 38:51.139
- Mr. Holbein.

38:51.207 --> 38:54.976
- Majesty, with your permission,
I came to show you my work
in progress.

39:10.326 --> 39:14.929
- Master Holbein.
When you painted my father,

39:14.997 --> 39:17.732
you made his likeness

39:17.833 --> 39:21.970
when he was old,
sickly, and ill.

39:22.004 --> 39:25.306
He looked nothing
like a King of England,

39:25.374 --> 39:27.475
more like a poor wretch!

39:30.146 --> 39:34.082
A feeble, plain,
and dying man.

39:34.183 --> 39:36.518
And now you have done
the same for me!

39:36.552 --> 39:39.220
- Majesty, I -

39:39.355 --> 39:42.190
- Mr. HOLBEIN!
This portrait is a lie!

39:49.498 --> 39:51.766
Do it again!

39:51.867 --> 39:54.202
And get out.

40:36.045 --> 40:38.480
- Why are you here?

40:38.581 --> 40:40.281
To see my daughter.

40:40.382 --> 40:43.218
She was the only pure
thing in my life.

40:43.252 --> 40:45.587
And in my life
I neglected her,

40:45.688 --> 40:49.057
since she was only a girl,
and I wanted so much
to give you a son.

40:49.191 --> 40:52.227
But now I am
so proud of her.

40:52.328 --> 40:55.530
Fiercely proud!
She is so clever.

40:55.664 --> 40:59.200
And though she is
like me in so many ways,

40:59.235 --> 41:01.769
she is not intemperate
as I was.

41:01.871 --> 41:05.440
You must be proud
of her too, Henry.

41:08.544 --> 41:13.081
- I am.
I am very proud of her.

41:13.215 --> 41:17.018
And I know
how clever she is.

41:21.724 --> 41:24.626
And I wish that
I could love her more.

41:29.064 --> 41:30.899
But from time to time

41:31.033 --> 41:34.469
she reminds me of you-

41:34.537 --> 41:37.972
and of what
you did to me.

41:38.073 --> 41:40.208
- I did nothing to you.

41:40.276 --> 41:41.910
I was innocent.

41:42.044 --> 41:45.046
All the accusations
against me were false.

41:47.550 --> 41:49.617
I thought you knew.

41:51.887 --> 41:53.922
Poor Katherine Howard.

41:54.056 --> 41:56.991
She lies in the cold
ground next to me.

41:57.092 --> 41:59.827
Poor child.

41:59.929 --> 42:02.263
It was not her
fault either.

42:02.331 --> 42:06.634
But we were like two moths,
drawn to the flame...

42:06.769 --> 42:09.637
and burned.

42:19.281 --> 42:21.449
- Anne, please don't!

42:38.767 --> 42:41.202
- His Majesty,
the King.

42:48.644 --> 42:51.546
Your Majesty.

42:55.651 --> 42:56.818
- Lady Mary...

42:56.885 --> 43:00.388
Lady Elizabeth...

43:02.224 --> 43:05.627
Kate...

43:05.694 --> 43:07.795
Come here!

43:11.133 --> 43:13.401
I have decided

43:13.502 --> 43:15.670
to send you away
to Greenwich.

43:15.804 --> 43:18.206
I will not spend
Christmastide

43:18.340 --> 43:21.142
with you this year...
or thereafter.

43:24.346 --> 43:26.347
- Why, Your Majesty?

43:26.415 --> 43:27.348
- Kate,

43:27.416 --> 43:29.917
do not question
my command.

43:30.019 --> 43:32.220
It is as it is.

43:32.321 --> 43:36.391
- Yes, Your Majesty.

43:42.264 --> 43:44.198
- Mary.

43:44.266 --> 43:46.701
You must be a kind

43:46.735 --> 43:49.103
and loving mother
to your brother,

43:49.204 --> 43:51.406
who I leave
in this world

43:51.540 --> 43:54.575
a helpless
little child.

43:56.879 --> 43:59.047
- Please,
father, I beg you,

43:59.081 --> 44:00.882
do not leave
me an orphan so soon!

44:00.916 --> 44:04.686
- Mary,

44:04.720 --> 44:07.188
Mary.

44:13.062 --> 44:16.531
Elizabeth.

44:20.736 --> 44:24.372
You are
so very young,

44:24.406 --> 44:26.374
but you, too

44:26.408 --> 44:28.543
can look
after your brother.

44:28.577 --> 44:32.280
- Yes, Your Majesty.
I promise.

44:32.347 --> 44:35.249
- Bless you, child.

44:35.317 --> 44:38.453
Bless you.

44:45.894 --> 44:48.262
Kate.

44:53.102 --> 44:57.605
The time has come
for us to bid farewell.

44:57.673 --> 45:00.441
It is God's will.

45:02.344 --> 45:04.512
When I die,

45:04.613 --> 45:06.481
I order
these gentlemen

45:06.582 --> 45:07.782
to treat you
as if I were living still.

45:10.919 --> 45:13.788
And if it is your
pleasure to remarry,

45:13.922 --> 45:17.425
I order that you shall
have 7,000 pounds a year

45:17.493 --> 45:21.395
as long as you live
for your service,

45:21.463 --> 45:25.900
as well as your jewels
and ornaments.

45:55.097 --> 45:57.098
Now go.

46:34.136 --> 46:36.170
How is my son?

46:42.344 --> 46:44.545
- Jane!

46:47.749 --> 46:49.984
He is well.

46:50.018 --> 46:54.088
I have taken
all care of him...

46:54.189 --> 46:56.891
sweet Jane.

46:59.494 --> 47:03.264
And soon,
he will be King.

47:06.101 --> 47:08.536
- My poor boy.

47:08.570 --> 47:11.672
My poor child.

47:11.740 --> 47:13.674
- No!

47:13.709 --> 47:17.078
He is the most beloved.

47:17.212 --> 47:21.449
He is my special boy.

47:23.518 --> 47:27.388
- He will die young.
- No! No!

47:27.456 --> 47:29.390
- Poor child-

47:29.458 --> 47:32.460
you expected
too much of him!

47:32.561 --> 47:35.396
He was only a boy!

47:35.430 --> 47:39.200
Kings, too, are made of clay!

47:39.234 --> 47:41.035
And God forbid
you locked him away

47:41.069 --> 47:43.204
from the world,
like your father did with you.

47:43.238 --> 47:45.539
- No!

47:45.574 --> 47:47.408
- Don't you understand?

47:47.442 --> 47:49.744
You have killed him!

47:49.811 --> 47:52.914
- No!

48:13.001 --> 48:16.170
Herewith, my Lords,
is my testament.

48:16.271 --> 48:19.140
When I am dead,

48:19.207 --> 48:21.876
my Lord Hertford
will act as Lord Protector

48:21.944 --> 48:24.145
during Prince Edward's
minority.

48:24.246 --> 48:28.516
He will be supported
by my Lord Chancellor Risley

48:28.617 --> 48:30.518
and Archbishop Cranmer.

48:30.619 --> 48:34.689
It is my desire

48:34.756 --> 48:38.025
to be buried next to the body

48:38.126 --> 48:41.495
of my true and loving wife,
Queen Jane Seymour,

48:41.596 --> 48:44.999
at Windsor.

48:45.100 --> 48:47.401
You shall raise
an honorable tomb,

48:47.469 --> 48:49.570
upon which
will be our effigies,

48:49.638 --> 48:53.341
fashioned as if we are
sweetly sleeping.

50:39.748 --> 50:41.715
- Majesty.

50:53.295 --> 50:56.430
Your Majesty.

50:56.498 --> 50:58.666
Mr. Holbein awaits
you in the Chapel.

53:55.810 --> 54:00.047
- Master Holbein,
it is well done.

54:17.065 --> 54:20.776
Henry VII died
on January 28, 1547.

54:20.777 --> 54:26.702
His sole legitimate son became
King Edward VI at the age of nine.

54:26.703 --> 54:31.293
Only to die of illness
six years later.

54:31.294 --> 54:36.405
An attempt was made to prevent the
King's eldest daughter, Princess Mary,

54:36.406 --> 54:41.786
from becoming Queen because
of her Catholic beliefs.

54:41.787 --> 54:52.001
She was crowned in 1533. Her Reign was
short and turbulent. She burned many protestant
martyrs, and became known as "Bloody Mary".

54:52.002 --> 54:58.380
Her half-sister, Elizabeth, succeeded her
in 1558. Known to history as the Virgin Queen,
Elizabeth ruled England for forty-four years.

54:58.381 --> 55:04.614
Her Reign was called "The Golden Age".

55:06.494 --> 55:17.110
In Henry VIII and Elizabeth I, the Tudor
dynasty produced the two most
famous monarchs in English history.
