00:07.490 --> 00:09.690
Mom, Dad, great news.

00:09.730 --> 00:11.660
Since Harper and I graduated High School,

00:11.700 --> 00:14.660
we decided that we're ready to get
our own apartment and move out!

00:14.700 --> 00:16.570
What do you think?

00:16.600 --> 00:17.770
I think they love it.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.740
- Oh, my goodness, let's
start packing now. - Yeah!

00:19.770 --> 00:22.810
Wait a second!
Did I hear you correctly?

00:22.840 --> 00:24.670
You graduated High School?

00:26.910 --> 00:28.710
Nice parenting!

00:30.140 --> 00:32.720
Listen, Alex...
You want to move out?

00:34.450 --> 00:36.590
I don't think you guys
have thought this through.

00:36.620 --> 00:39.490
Doesn't matter.
Because I have.

00:39.520 --> 00:41.760
I've actually been waiting
for this moment for years.

00:41.790 --> 00:43.530
Here, check it out.

00:43.560 --> 00:46.830
Here's a blueprint of the house
without Alex in it.

00:48.700 --> 00:50.530
Well, where's my room?

00:50.570 --> 00:54.440
Gone. I'm going to build
my laboratory in it.

00:54.470 --> 00:57.740
Bonus, you can never move back in or visit.

01:00.680 --> 01:03.510
Alex, honey, moving out is a very big deal.

01:03.550 --> 01:05.410
For one thing, you're gonna need money,

01:05.450 --> 01:07.420
for things like food, rent...

01:07.450 --> 01:09.720
Oh, come on, Alex and I agreed years ago

01:09.750 --> 01:12.550
that when we had enough
money saved, we'd move out.

01:12.590 --> 01:15.420
- Right, Alex?
- Yeah.

01:18.700 --> 01:20.600
What about utilities?

01:20.630 --> 01:21.800
Where are you gonna get the money for that?

01:21.830 --> 01:24.800
Oh, I just figured I'd take some from here.

01:30.440 --> 01:32.440
Those are utensils.

01:32.480 --> 01:35.580
Well, then I don't know
what utilities are...

01:36.810 --> 01:38.580
...so I probably
don't need 'em.

01:38.620 --> 01:44.450
Oh, really? So you don't need
gas, heat, water, phone?

01:44.490 --> 01:47.890
You know, usually roommates
share the cost of those things.

01:48.890 --> 01:50.690
Did you know about all that?

01:50.730 --> 01:53.660
Yes, Alex, I knew we'd need water.

01:55.730 --> 01:58.730
If you two can earn
enough money to move out,

01:58.770 --> 02:02.740
that will prove how serious
you are, and we'd be supportive.

02:02.770 --> 02:04.770
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

02:04.810 --> 02:06.740
Thank you, thank you!

02:58.830 --> 03:01.830
Mom, Dad, Talia just told me her
parents want to meet you guys

03:01.870 --> 03:03.730
so they can get a sense of my family.

03:03.770 --> 03:06.700
I can't even make sense of this family,

03:06.740 --> 03:08.470
how are they gonna do it?

03:09.640 --> 03:11.770
You know what's worse than meeting parents?

03:11.810 --> 03:14.410
Meeting the kind of parents
that want to meet other parents.

03:15.580 --> 03:18.450
Yeah, you should just
put 'em off for a little while.

03:18.480 --> 03:20.380
All right, I'll put 'em off for two hours.

03:20.420 --> 03:21.680
They're coming over for lunch.

03:21.720 --> 03:25.350
Oh, I hate meeting new people.

03:25.390 --> 03:28.420
But I do like lunch.
It's... There's...

03:28.460 --> 03:30.490
I'm torn!

03:32.500 --> 03:35.360
Justin, I just heard
your sister's moving out.

03:35.400 --> 03:36.830
Now we can take over her room.

03:36.870 --> 03:41.770
"Operation: Sister's Moving Out
is in high gear. Ver Her Room"

03:41.800 --> 03:47.540
We're gonna have enough room
moonscape biosphere! e

03:51.680 --> 03:56.450
I'm Harper's latest craft
project, Venus Paloma.

03:56.490 --> 03:58.750
Harper, please stop playing with puppets.

03:58.790 --> 04:01.460
I'm trying to figure out
a way to make money.

04:01.490 --> 04:05.390
All right, what do we have
that people would pay for?

04:05.430 --> 04:08.700
That's a cute puppet.
Are you doing a show?

04:08.730 --> 04:10.500
Hey, quiet, little girl!

04:10.530 --> 04:13.300
We're trying to think
of a way we can make money.

04:13.340 --> 04:14.770
Sorry, but I just wanted to know

04:14.800 --> 04:16.670
where I can buy a ticket
for the puppet show.

04:16.709 --> 04:21.480
Kid, please!
Don't make me tell you again.

04:23.610 --> 04:27.650
Wait a minute! That puppet lovin'
little girl just gave me an idea.

04:27.680 --> 04:30.520
We could make money by
putting on a puppet show!

04:30.550 --> 04:34.390
That's a terrific idea!
I'm ready to be a rock star!

04:34.420 --> 04:35.590
OK, then it's settled.

04:35.630 --> 04:37.630
You make another marionette,
and I'll write a script

04:37.660 --> 04:40.430
about two oddball friends
making their way in the world.

04:40.460 --> 04:43.730
OK, and we'll build the puppet
stage to make sure you move out.

All right, guys, Talia's
parents are on their way up.

04:55.650 --> 04:57.610
So let me give you a tip, so
you have plenty to talk about.

04:57.650 --> 05:00.650
- OK. - They love the Mets and they
like going to the movie theater.

05:00.680 --> 05:03.450
Perfect. Your father
and I love that stuff.

05:03.490 --> 05:05.350
That's why we get along so well.

05:05.390 --> 05:08.420
On Saturday afternoons,
I go to a ball game,

05:08.460 --> 05:11.360
and your mom goes
to a movie about feelings.

05:12.730 --> 05:15.400
All right, that's them.

05:21.570 --> 05:24.440
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Robinson,
welcome to our home.

05:24.470 --> 05:27.580
These are my parents, Theresa and Jerry.

05:27.610 --> 05:31.410
And these are my parents, Rob and Meg.

05:31.450 --> 05:34.450
- Oh, so nicto meet you.
- Lovely to meet you.

05:34.480 --> 05:36.590
- Oh, come on in.
- Hi.

05:36.620 --> 05:38.420
- How you doing?
- Hi.

05:40.760 --> 05:43.460
Did you prep your parents?
This is really important.

05:43.490 --> 05:46.330
Yeah, I told them your parents
love the movies and the Mets.

05:46.360 --> 05:48.730
No! No, I said they like
going to the Met.

05:48.770 --> 05:50.670
Short for "Metropolitan
Opera House."

05:50.700 --> 05:52.570
And going to the theater for plays.

05:52.600 --> 05:53.740
Oh, OK.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.500
Uh, they're not prepped at all, then.

05:56.570 --> 05:58.570
So, Rob, Meg...

05:58.610 --> 06:02.740
We love the Mets so much.
How about you guys?

06:02.780 --> 06:04.610
We were just there on Saturday.

06:04.650 --> 06:06.550
Just a splendid production.

06:06.580 --> 06:08.620
Oh, when they beat the Phillies?

06:08.650 --> 06:14.260
What? Someone got beaten
at the Metropolitan Opera House?

06:14.290 --> 06:17.360
No, no, I'm talking about
the baseball team, the Mets.

06:17.390 --> 06:19.430
But if someone got beaten
at the opera house...

06:19.460 --> 06:21.600
Ha-ha! I actually might go.

06:22.730 --> 06:24.370
Uh... To save them!

06:24.400 --> 06:26.670
My dad would go anywhere
to save an opera lover.

06:28.400 --> 06:30.270
We go to the opera all the time.

06:30.310 --> 06:34.480
We place a ridiculously high value
on education and cultural awareness.

06:36.280 --> 06:38.710
Yes, our family motto is,
"The more you know...

06:38.750 --> 06:40.720
...it's still
not enough."

06:42.620 --> 06:47.290
Obviously, the
Russes care about learning, too.

06:47.320 --> 06:50.290
I mean, look how many books they have on...

06:50.330 --> 06:52.430
...reality show celebrities.

06:54.400 --> 06:56.630
See, the thing is, we really don't
get to go to the opera often,

06:56.670 --> 06:59.570
'cause, you know, we're
too busy going to the movies.

06:59.600 --> 07:02.340
I have a feeling you can relate to that.

07:03.710 --> 07:06.370
Actually, no, we don't go to the movies.

07:06.410 --> 07:08.280
We prefer live theater.

07:08.310 --> 07:10.510
Well, we went to the theater once,

07:12.420 --> 07:16.550
But, you know, the show seemed to end,
like, right in the middle of the story.

07:16.590 --> 07:18.720
I didn't get it.

07:20.290 --> 07:21.690
That was the intermission.

07:23.260 --> 07:25.660
You see Jerry, I told you there was more.

07:27.260 --> 07:29.230
You know?

07:29.270 --> 07:33.270
We don't think this is an intellectually
stimulating environment for Talia.

07:33.300 --> 07:35.440
I don't even have to confer
with my wife on this.

07:36.710 --> 07:40.440
Perhaps it's best that Max and Talia
don't see each other anymore.

07:40.480 --> 07:42.410
Well... hold on.

07:42.450 --> 07:44.480
You're saying we can't see each
other anymore because...

07:44.510 --> 07:47.520
...what, my parents don't go to the opera
house and they like the wrong kind of Mets?

07:47.550 --> 07:49.680
We also don't like your books.

07:49.720 --> 07:51.690
Talia, let's go.

07:53.760 --> 07:56.530
- Mom, Dad, please...
- Talia, let's go.

07:58.760 --> 08:00.530
Talia, I tried.

08:01.500 --> 08:03.300
Goodbye, Max.

08:10.270 --> 08:12.540
All right, sorry I'm late.

08:12.580 --> 08:15.410
I overslept and didn't have
a chance to write the script.

08:15.440 --> 08:19.480
But I am well-rested
so that... is good.

08:21.250 --> 08:23.590
Excuse me? You didn't
write the script?

08:23.620 --> 08:26.590
ÍDon't worry, Harper, we'll just wing it.

08:26.620 --> 08:28.320
Oh yeah, we'll just wing it.

08:28.360 --> 08:31.330
Yeah, you know, I made puppets,
they made a stage.

08:31.360 --> 08:34.659
We all did what we said we were
going to do, except for you.

08:34.700 --> 08:36.530
Don't you care about us moving out?

08:36.570 --> 08:38.530
Of course I do, Harper.

08:38.570 --> 08:41.299
They're just kids.
They love anything you put in front of them.

08:41.700 --> 08:44.240
Look, we'll just be, like,

08:44.270 --> 08:46.440
"Hello, puppet.
How are you?"

08:46.480 --> 08:49.710
You'll be, like, "Hello, puppet.
I'm good, how are you?"

08:49.750 --> 08:52.480
Right? Not bad,
huh, kids? Yeah?

08:54.750 --> 08:58.550
Sorry, kids. Show's canceled
due to laziness.

08:59.520 --> 09:01.590
Aww...

09:03.360 --> 09:05.260
- Wait a minute!
- There's no show?

09:05.290 --> 09:10.430
Zeke, you need to do something, or we can kiss
our plexi-dome moonscape biosphere goodbye.

09:12.370 --> 09:14.270
Hey, kids!

09:14.300 --> 09:17.340
Puppet shows are great,
but you know what's better?

09:17.370 --> 09:19.570
Mimes! Whoa!

09:19.610 --> 09:21.580
Look, I can pull a rope!

09:23.580 --> 09:25.550
It goes on forever!

09:25.580 --> 09:29.250
Wow, how about a donation, folks, huh?

09:29.290 --> 09:31.420
Come on, put some
money in the hat. Come on.

09:31.450 --> 09:33.290
Put your hat back on, mister.

09:33.320 --> 09:36.520
I'm not a "mister," I am in my late teens!

09:37.560 --> 09:39.230
Way to go, Alex.

09:39.260 --> 09:41.400
Once again, you've earned
no money for our apartment.

09:41.430 --> 09:43.430
What are you so mad about, Harper?

09:43.470 --> 09:45.500
We'll just figure out another
way to make money and move out.

09:45.530 --> 09:48.370
You don't get it, do you?

09:48.400 --> 09:50.640
If I can't rely on you
for a simple puppet show,

09:50.670 --> 09:55.410
how could I ever rely on you for something
more important, like sharing an apartment?

09:55.440 --> 09:57.310
I'm not moving out with you, Alex.

09:57.350 --> 09:58.550
I'm moving out on my own.

10:12.440 --> 10:14.630
Max, you all right?

10:15.800 --> 10:18.400
I'm just writing Talia's
name on my arm in mustard.

10:19.810 --> 10:21.840
I really miss her.

10:23.640 --> 10:25.480
I'm sorry, man.

10:25.510 --> 10:26.810
Maybe I can help.

10:28.110 --> 10:30.580
OK, there's only one "L" and
you need an "A" at the end.

10:31.870 --> 10:35.620
Thanks, man, but there's no point in
me learning to spell her name now.

10:35.660 --> 10:38.730
Mom and Dad didn't make a good first
impression when they met her parents.

10:38.760 --> 10:41.490
Yeah, of course they didn't.
They don't im-press people,

10:41.530 --> 10:44.860
- they de-press people.
- I just...

10:44.900 --> 10:48.670
I just wish there was a way that they
could meet all over again, you know?

10:48.700 --> 10:50.470
Hold on...

10:50.500 --> 10:52.610
There is!

10:52.640 --> 10:54.670
You could use the "clean slate" spell,

10:54.710 --> 10:57.610
so Talia's parents don't
remember meeting our parents.

10:57.650 --> 10:59.550
- Really?
- Yes.

10:59.580 --> 11:02.880
Wow, you're usually not the one telling
me to use magic to fix my problems.

11:02.920 --> 11:06.790
I know. But, I do know
what it's like

11:06.820 --> 11:09.760
to have loved and lost a girl.

11:09.790 --> 11:11.560
Twice.

11:12.590 --> 11:14.390
And then another girl.

11:15.760 --> 11:17.760
And I don't want that to happen to you.

11:17.800 --> 11:19.530
Does the spell work through the phone?

11:19.570 --> 11:21.400
All spells work through the phone now.

11:21.440 --> 11:23.400
It's not 1991.

11:23.440 --> 11:25.510
All right, I'm calling the Robinsons.

11:33.850 --> 11:37.350
Rob Robinson speaking.

11:37.380 --> 11:41.420
Hj, um... Is your wife in the
room with you by any chance?

11:41.460 --> 11:44.490
Yes, she's in the middle
of practicing her violin...

11:44.530 --> 11:46.660
...but I'd be happy to interrupt her.

11:48.360 --> 11:50.430
OK, do it now!

11:50.460 --> 11:51.600
Robinsons and Russes, clean the slate,

11:51.630 --> 11:53.470
meet again and change your fate!

11:55.700 --> 11:59.410
All right. Now I guess I just call
back and invite the Robinsons over.

12:02.480 --> 12:07.550
Meg Robinson speaking.

12:07.580 --> 12:11.620
Hello, Meg. This is
Theresa Russo, Max's mother.

12:13.550 --> 12:16.490
Ooh, hi, Mrs. Russo.

12:16.520 --> 12:20.360
Do you have a cold?
You sound like a teenage boy.

12:21.560 --> 12:22.630
Thank you.

12:23.800 --> 12:27.330
Listen, why don't you guys
come over around six tonight?

12:27.370 --> 12:29.400
Jerry and I think it's
about time we met you guys.

12:29.440 --> 12:32.670
Ooh, I'd have to cancel my violin lesson...

12:32.710 --> 12:34.770
Oh, I'll make sure that happens.
We'll be there.

12:37.540 --> 12:39.610
Hello, Annie. I'm home.

12:39.650 --> 12:42.520
I bought us groceries
for our new apartment.

12:42.550 --> 12:45.520
Cool. Just put 'em
in the cooking room.

12:45.550 --> 12:48.590
These bags are heavy.

12:48.620 --> 12:51.420
- Can you help?
- Sure, I'll help you.

12:52.560 --> 12:55.430
Whew, I'm exhausted!

12:56.630 --> 12:58.360
I'm gonna lay down and take a nap.

12:58.400 --> 13:00.470
But you didn't even help me.

13:00.500 --> 13:03.440
Well, you know how unreliable I am.

13:03.470 --> 13:05.740
I can't even carry my own weight.

13:07.510 --> 13:11.310
Yeah, that's why I'm a hero
for just being friends with you.

13:11.350 --> 13:12.410
The end!

13:16.380 --> 13:19.290
Oh, thank you, guys.
Thanks for coming to the show.

13:19.320 --> 13:21.550
Oh, I see it's allowance week,
Jimmy. Thank you.

13:22.520 --> 13:24.390
That Annie didn't lift a finger.

13:24.420 --> 13:25.560
Right?

13:25.590 --> 13:27.630
- Hey, guys.
- Harper, great show!

13:27.660 --> 13:30.360
Where did you come up with all
these characters out of thin air?

13:30.400 --> 13:33.500
Annie really reminded me
of somebody. Just...

13:33.530 --> 13:37.770
Really, you couldn't tell that that
was a thinly-veiled attack on Alex?

13:39.340 --> 13:40.470
I could tell.

13:44.550 --> 13:46.510
She reminded me of Alex!

13:55.420 --> 13:57.490
So you want us to meet
the Robinsons all over?

13:57.520 --> 14:00.490
Wait, weren't we humiliated
enough the first time?

14:01.730 --> 14:04.600
Dad, Talia is my first real
girlfriend, all right?

14:04.630 --> 14:06.300
And you guys ruined it.

14:06.330 --> 14:08.600
You gave us terrible information.

14:09.670 --> 14:11.470
And you listened to me.

14:11.510 --> 14:13.310
Which some people would say is worse.

14:14.780 --> 14:17.540
Look, Justin did a spell so her
parents don't remember any of it.

14:17.580 --> 14:20.480
What do you say?
Come on, Ma, Jerry...

14:20.510 --> 14:22.450
Wanna give this anotheshot?

14:22.480 --> 14:25.690
I don't think so, Max.

14:25.720 --> 14:27.650
Great, that's them.
Let's do this!

14:27.690 --> 14:30.390
OK, fine.

14:32.460 --> 14:33.590
- Hi.
- Hello.

14:33.630 --> 14:37.330
- Oh, hello. - Hi, I'm Meg Robinson.
My husband, Rob.

14:37.360 --> 14:40.530
It's so nice to finally meet Max's parents.

14:40.570 --> 14:41.730
Yes, so nice to meet you, too.

14:41.770 --> 14:43.570
You know, we've talked about it so much,

14:43.600 --> 14:46.370
I feel like we've already met you.

14:46.410 --> 14:48.540
- Come on in.
- Hello.

14:48.580 --> 14:50.540
Hi, Rob, I'm Jerry.

14:50.580 --> 14:54.510
Those calluses on my hands are
not from me playing baseball,

14:54.550 --> 14:56.480
but they're from me...

14:56.520 --> 14:58.480
...rubbing my chin
while thinking.

14:59.790 --> 15:02.520
Yes, um, my dad does a lot of thinking.

15:02.560 --> 15:05.520
He was on the thinking team
back in college.

15:05.560 --> 15:07.460
You know what I'm thinking about right now?

15:07.490 --> 15:10.630
A book I'm reading about the Met.

15:10.660 --> 15:14.570
Not the baseball team, the Mets.

15:14.600 --> 15:18.700
I bet there's some culturally unaware
people ãthat might confuse the two.

15:23.280 --> 15:26.410
Sometimes I have to force Jerry
to stop reading about the Met

15:26.450 --> 15:28.380
before we go to the Met.

15:28.420 --> 15:31.350
We like the opera so much
more than the movies.

15:31.390 --> 15:34.250
That's nice.
What's your favorite opera?

15:34.290 --> 15:36.520
Her favorite opera is Winfrey.

15:40.330 --> 15:42.700
What? Opera Winfrey, Ma.
You watch it every day.

15:42.730 --> 15:44.730
He's kidding.

15:44.770 --> 15:46.270
Ha-ha-ha!

15:46.300 --> 15:47.530
I have an idea.

15:47.570 --> 15:50.470
Let's all go see
Wagner's <i>The Ring.</i>

15:50.500 --> 15:51.700
It's playing at the Met tonight.

15:51.740 --> 15:55.370
Oh, that would be wonderful!

15:57.410 --> 15:59.310
Pardon me for interrupting this great time,

15:59.350 --> 16:01.410
but is it OK if I still see your daughter?

16:01.450 --> 16:03.680
Absolutely.

16:03.720 --> 16:08.220
This is obviously a culturally
stimulating environment for Talia.

16:08.260 --> 16:10.520
We haven't found anyone else's parents

16:10.560 --> 16:14.390
to be sophisticated enough to sit
through 16 hours of <i>The Ring.</i>

16:14.430 --> 16:17.260
What?

16:19.270 --> 16:20.700
Sixteen hours?

16:20.730 --> 16:25.710
Yes. Ah, I wish
it were longer, too.

16:25.740 --> 16:31.510
Oh... this is gonna be
a great evening!

16:31.550 --> 16:34.350
So fun!

16:34.380 --> 16:38.420
In 17 hours, I am so gonna get you.

16:50.400 --> 16:53.630
Harper is still out there making
tons of money making fun of me.

16:53.670 --> 16:57.640
But I will say that that Annie
has an undeniable charm.

16:57.670 --> 17:00.440
Alex, You need to make things
right with Harper,

17:00.470 --> 17:04.640
so I can fulfill my dream and building a
plexi-dome moonscape biosphere in your room.

17:07.310 --> 17:10.319
All right, where should I put
the dual power generator?

17:12.690 --> 17:16.319
This is gonna be how we generate
electricity in the biosphere.

17:16.359 --> 17:18.490
Hit it!

17:18.530 --> 17:21.230
See Alex, Zeke and I can work together.

17:21.260 --> 17:23.300
Why can't you and Harper?
I can't breathe.

17:24.630 --> 17:27.700
Well, Harper and I don't
need to work together.

17:27.730 --> 17:31.470
I'm going to do my own show
and move out by myself.

17:31.510 --> 17:33.440
But you don't know how to make marionettes.

17:33.470 --> 17:35.410
Oh, yes I do.

17:35.440 --> 17:38.510
Turn this clever spell-caster
into Alex, the puppet master.

17:38.550 --> 17:39.650
Oh, no! That sounds
like a spell!

17:43.350 --> 17:47.350
Hey, I did not agree
to be turned into a puppet!

17:47.390 --> 17:50.490
Oh, these lederhosen
are way nicer than mine.

17:54.560 --> 17:56.560
It's showtime.

18:00.600 --> 18:03.570
Annie, it's time to get out of bed.

18:03.600 --> 18:06.210
I only get up on weekends!

18:12.480 --> 18:14.280
I'm gonna need a stage.

18:16.450 --> 18:19.590
Build a puppet stage to earn a hefty wage.

18:23.690 --> 18:26.530
Hey, everybody! Come check out
this marionette show.

18:26.560 --> 18:29.360
You're gonna like it so much better.

18:35.340 --> 18:36.600
Lady, please help me.

18:36.640 --> 18:39.240
I'm being forced to do this
against my will.

18:42.640 --> 18:44.580
Zeke! Just do
the show, man.

18:44.610 --> 18:46.280
Do it for us.

18:46.310 --> 18:48.510
Do it for the plexi-dome
moonscape biosphere.

18:48.550 --> 18:50.320
Now, come on, let's dance.

18:50.350 --> 18:52.280
The people love it.

19:00.360 --> 19:02.600
Come on. Dance, Zeke!

19:02.630 --> 19:06.170
Stop! Must...
resist... the strings.

19:08.240 --> 19:09.570
Everybody stop!
Don't go!

19:09.600 --> 19:11.270
There's more!

19:11.300 --> 19:13.570
Heather is about to accuse
Annie of being selfish,

19:13.610 --> 19:16.340
irresponsible, and
of stealing her audience.

19:16.380 --> 19:18.280
All right, we get it.

19:18.310 --> 19:19.550
Annie's the cool one.

19:22.220 --> 19:24.350
Justin, Zeke is resisting.

19:24.380 --> 19:27.390
Just...Just turn him around
and I'll kick him into helping.

19:31.590 --> 19:33.330
Oh, stop it! Stop!

19:33.360 --> 19:35.390
I am not stopping until you do the show!

19:39.530 --> 19:43.200
Stop, stop! Please stop! I'll do it.
All right, I'll do it!

19:44.500 --> 19:45.670
- I'm out of here.
- Zeke!

19:50.440 --> 19:52.380
I'm not your puppet!

19:53.680 --> 19:55.410
Zeke!

19:55.450 --> 19:57.480
What about our biosphere?

20:03.520 --> 20:05.660
Remote control marionettes.
How 'bout that?

20:05.690 --> 20:09.430
Now that's a show!
Pay her, Mom.

20:10.630 --> 20:12.330
Thank you!

20:13.430 --> 20:14.530
Thank you.

20:17.400 --> 20:19.240
Thank you so much.

20:22.280 --> 20:23.610
Congratulations, Alex.

20:25.250 --> 20:26.650
It looks like you're the one
who gets to move out.

20:41.660 --> 20:45.460
It's the Annie
and Heather Show. Yay!

20:47.600 --> 20:51.300
When we last left them, they were
in the middle of an ugly argument

20:51.340 --> 20:54.740
about irresponsible Annie
with a heart of gold.

20:56.510 --> 20:58.380
Look, Heather, I made tons of dough,

20:58.410 --> 21:00.250
so we can get an apartment.

21:00.280 --> 21:02.450
I'm not gonna move out without you.

21:02.480 --> 21:04.650
Aw, Annie, you're not perfect,

21:04.680 --> 21:07.490
but you usually come through
after a bad situation.

21:07.520 --> 21:10.290
We're best friends forever.

21:13.630 --> 21:15.460
Seriously, we are.

21:15.500 --> 21:17.300
I know!

21:17.330 --> 21:19.370
But I can't wait for bad things to happen

21:19.400 --> 21:21.370
for you decide to do the right thing.

21:21.400 --> 21:23.500
I have to be able to count on you.

21:25.340 --> 21:27.310
That sounds like a warning,

21:27.340 --> 21:29.510
like we're gonna be living together.

21:31.280 --> 21:33.180
Promise you'll pull your own weight?

21:33.210 --> 21:35.250
- I promise.
- And respect the chore chart?

21:35.280 --> 21:36.380
And... Chore chart?

21:37.550 --> 21:40.320
- Only if you respect my
sleeping chart. - No.

21:40.350 --> 21:43.290
All right, I didn't want to go through
the trouble of making a chart anyway.

21:43.320 --> 21:44.620
It's a deal.

21:51.840 --> 21:53.530
They didn't see us, did they?

21:53.530 --> 21:55.420
No No. We've got our plan.

21:55.420 --> 21:59.270
What kind of language is that 
and how can everybody follow with?

21:59.270 --> 22:01.370
Hey! What's going on?

22:01.370 --> 22:03.650
You guys are supposed to be at the opera with Talia's parents.

22:03.650 --> 22:05.830
We snuck out!

22:06.400 --> 22:08.450
Yeah! We're gonna go upstairs, take a nap,

22:08.450 --> 22:10.500
and get something to eat then sneak back in.

22:10.500 --> 22:11.490
They'll never know.

22:11.490 --> 22:14.390
Don't you think that they'll notice when
the light comes up for the mission?

22:15.730 --> 22:18.450
That's right. There's an intonation.

22:19.110 --> 22:22.040
Oh Jerry, we have to go back.

22:22.280 --> 22:23.540
Come on.

22:25.820 --> 22:28.900
I'm still gonna get you in 13 hours.

22:29.650 --> 22:32.430
Hi Talia. Oh it's kute.

22:32.570 --> 22:33.890
Clean that up.
