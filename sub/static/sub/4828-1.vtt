00:17.436 --> 00:22.399
Jerome!
Put on that Bobby Womack.

00:22.607 --> 00:27.571
No, girl, I want to go way back.
Oh yeah, check this out.

02:22.853 --> 02:28.859
Please put that in the kitchen.
And watch the wall... the wall!

02:29.776 --> 02:34.781
- Who is this pretty lady?
- I told Oliver we shouldn't do this here.

02:34.990 --> 02:41.121
- What's wrong?
- Why couldn't we do it at the church?

02:41.329 --> 02:47.377
- Mike, get that out of my face, please.
- Mr Blackman is going to like this one.

02:47.586 --> 02:55.586
Yeah? I have some videos myself.
You know I keep everything, boy.

02:55.886 --> 03:01.433
- Are you trying to blackmail me?
- That's exactly what I'm trying to do.

03:03.185 --> 03:06.563
Tell my son Roland I want to see him.

03:06.772 --> 03:11.151
Oliver, time to set up
the chairs outside.

03:12.903 --> 03:16.198
It just wouldn't seem right
without any drama.

03:16.406 --> 03:21.995
I never thought Roland would
get married. Apparently, neither did he.

03:22.204 --> 03:26.792
The wedding kicks off in three hours
and nobody can find him.

03:30.128 --> 03:35.884
My name is Mike. Big Mike
in the Wood, but we'll get to that later.

03:39.638 --> 03:41.932
What's the Wood?

03:45.143 --> 03:49.690
It's not what you think it is.
No, it's Inglewood, California.

03:49.898 --> 03:55.529
It's where we grew up.
Me, Roland and Slim.

03:55.737 --> 04:02.369
There's Slim. He's been pissed off
ever since Roland went missing.

04:02.577 --> 04:08.583
- Every five minutes he says...
- Where the fuck is that nigger?

04:08.792 --> 04:12.504
- See?
- Who the fuck are you talking to?

04:14.756 --> 04:16.882
Excuse me.

04:18.552 --> 04:23.306
If Roland didn't want to get married,
he shouldn't have asked.

04:23.515 --> 04:28.478
Nobody forced him. He wants to be
Hugh Hefner and get married.

04:28.687 --> 04:34.943
- Hugh Hefner is married.
- He's divorced... Fuck him, too!

04:35.152 --> 04:39.948
The point is, we were supposed
to meet the photographer an hour ago!

04:40.157 --> 04:45.287
And don't ever front me
in front of people we don't know.

04:45.495 --> 04:52.753
Don't mind Slim. He and Ro are always
in disagreement about something.

04:52.961 --> 04:55.714
It's always been that way.

04:55.922 --> 05:01.011
Me? I get to play the peacemaker.
The mediator.

05:11.855 --> 05:17.736
Goddamn! It's hard to believe we
dressed like this and thought it cool.

05:20.614 --> 05:21.948
Oh, man.

05:28.413 --> 05:33.418
In 1986 me, my little brother
and my mom moved to Inglewood.

05:33.627 --> 05:35.754
An L.A. suburb.

05:35.962 --> 05:42.094
My mom got a new job at the hospital.
For the last time, I hoped.

05:42.302 --> 05:45.597
This was my third school in five years.

05:53.772 --> 05:59.986
It was just like the movies here.
Middle of January, yet 80 degrees.

06:00.195 --> 06:05.492
Palm trees, sunny skies
and, of course, beautiful women.

06:05.701 --> 06:09.996
You see her titties in "Purple Rain"?
You could eat off those.

06:12.207 --> 06:14.918
- You're crazy.
- Vanity looked fine in "Last Dragon".

06:15.127 --> 06:20.882
She didn't show no tit.
Let's ask him, man.

06:21.091 --> 06:26.763
- Who's finer, Vanity or Apolonia?
- Apolonia, man.

06:28.015 --> 06:30.642
- Vanity.
- What did I tell you?

06:30.851 --> 06:34.271
- He doesn't know anything.
- You're the new kid, right?

06:35.439 --> 06:41.862
So, are you cuz or blood?
Are you cuz or blood?

06:42.904 --> 06:48.285
- Cuz what?
- What set are you from, man?

06:50.078 --> 06:54.583
I don't know anything about any sets.
I'm from North Carolina.

06:54.791 --> 06:59.963
North Carolina? That's why
the nigger sounds like Willie Nelson.

07:00.172 --> 07:06.136
You better hang with us. You got
to learn how to make it in the Wood.

07:07.596 --> 07:13.435
- Otherwise you might get shot.
- Shot?

07:13.643 --> 07:16.521
You know, shot. Bang-bang.

07:17.981 --> 07:23.362
- The nigger don't know nothing.
- We've got to teach him the ropes.

07:23.570 --> 07:29.201
- I'm Roland. This skinny fool is Slim.
- I'm Mike.

07:29.409 --> 07:32.913
- You play ball?
- I play baseball.

07:35.540 --> 07:39.336
We ain't in Boston. That's that
white boy, Ricky Schroeder shit.

07:39.544 --> 07:45.801
- I mean basketball.
- No. But I watch it a lot.

07:48.637 --> 07:51.973
Rule number one in the Wood:
Either you gang-bang or you play ball.

07:52.182 --> 07:57.562
Or you could be a pimp, like me.
Because I've got to stay clean.

08:00.857 --> 08:04.361
Whose homeroom are you in?

08:04.569 --> 08:11.034
- Mrs Hughes.
- That's where we're going.

08:11.243 --> 08:14.121
What's up with the threads, man?

08:14.329 --> 08:17.624
And look out for Mrs Hughes.
Somebody should give her a Tic Tac.

08:36.643 --> 08:38.562
Oh, man!

08:42.315 --> 08:45.694
- Who is that?
- That's Alicia.

08:45.902 --> 08:50.198
- She's fine as hell, ain't she?
- You ain't never lying.

08:50.407 --> 08:57.372
- What, you like her?
- No, I just think she looks good.

09:01.043 --> 09:05.547
So does every nigger in the school.
Watch this, though.

09:05.756 --> 09:09.134
- Alicia...
- What are you doing?

09:09.343 --> 09:14.014
Alicia, you're looking nice today.

09:18.143 --> 09:21.521
You ain't got a play. Give it up.

09:22.606 --> 09:28.320
Alicia. It was early in the morning,
but my hormones were wide awake.

09:30.113 --> 09:35.202
Settle down. Before we begin,
I'd like to introduce Michael.

09:35.410 --> 09:40.040
Today is his first day. Stand up
and tell the class about yourself.

09:42.209 --> 09:44.419
Yeah, Michael.

09:50.133 --> 09:53.970
I kept thinking,
"Please go down. Please!"

09:58.892 --> 10:05.232
- Well, I'm Mike...
- Come up here, so we can see you.

10:07.025 --> 10:13.407
I've got to be cool.
Think of something. Baseball.

10:13.615 --> 10:18.870
First base, second... Hell,
I'd like to hit a home run with Alicia.

10:19.079 --> 10:20.706
Shit, bad move!

10:30.007 --> 10:32.342
Well, I'm Mike.

10:33.468 --> 10:40.058
I'm from North Carolina...
and I like sports.

10:40.934 --> 10:44.813
- And that's it.
- "I like sports and that's it."

10:45.022 --> 10:51.945
Levinio, is something amusing you?
Then turn to page 15, like the rest.

10:52.154 --> 10:56.908
- Levinio?
- What page is 15 on?

10:57.951 --> 10:59.286
Never mind. I'll find it.

11:10.380 --> 11:12.299
Roland.

11:15.719 --> 11:19.389
- Whose number is that anyway?
- We'll find out.

11:22.976 --> 11:25.437
- Hello.
- Who's this?

11:25.645 --> 11:31.860
- Nice to speak to you too, Slim.
- Tanya? This is real bad.

11:32.069 --> 11:34.112
Is Ro over there?

11:34.321 --> 11:38.533
Yeah, and he's pretty jacked up.
Would you be quiet!

11:40.369 --> 11:41.787
He's been drinking.

11:41.995 --> 11:47.250
- That nigger don't drink.
- This is an enormous snag.

11:47.459 --> 11:52.214
Roland and Tanya,
that was his first love. First...

11:53.715 --> 11:57.719
Keep that fool there. We're coming.

11:57.928 --> 12:03.308
Hurry up, or I'll put my foot
where it don't belong.

12:03.517 --> 12:06.812
- Hurry up.
- We're coming right now.

12:07.896 --> 12:12.484
- What's up?
- I hope he didn't do what I think.

12:12.693 --> 12:15.821
We've just got to go and get him.

12:18.448 --> 12:22.869
- That's sweet. When did you get that?
- A couple of weeks ago.

12:23.078 --> 12:26.707
Nothing big.
A little something.

12:33.797 --> 12:38.510
If you work hard, you might
afford one of these one day.

12:40.887 --> 12:45.767
- What's up?
- Come here, my childhood nigger!

12:47.644 --> 12:51.189
- What's wrong?
- Why the long faces?

12:51.398 --> 12:56.820
- What have you been drinking?
- Have you forgot about today?

12:57.029 --> 12:59.531
The flowers, the family, Lisa?

12:59.740 --> 13:03.660
Lisa...
I bet she's looking pretty.

13:03.869 --> 13:09.166
- Is she, Slim?
- He came like this an hour ago.

13:09.374 --> 13:13.628
Making love forever...

13:18.050 --> 13:21.595
- That was our song.
- What's wrong with you?

13:23.138 --> 13:28.894
- You didn't fuck, did you?
- No. What do I look like?

13:29.102 --> 13:36.068
- I'm just saying...
- Nothing happened. Leave it at that.

13:36.276 --> 13:40.864
- Let's go before she whops my ass.
- I ain't going to that place.

13:41.073 --> 13:45.452
What do you mean?
I paid $100 for this tux!

13:45.660 --> 13:51.249
- I'll go and get some coffee.
- And get some Listerine, too.

13:51.458 --> 13:58.799
Listen. Get the fuck out of here,
because I'm trying to get into that.

13:59.007 --> 14:04.262
Did you see her booty?
I'm going to make her booty giggle.

14:04.471 --> 14:09.059
- What is wrong with you?
- You wanted to squeeze it.

14:09.267 --> 14:12.896
You're getting married. Don't be a punk.

14:13.105 --> 14:18.902
- You're a punk.
- I will whop your mud-bone ass.

14:20.070 --> 14:23.573
You're fucking up big time, man.

14:25.951 --> 14:30.956
Damn, Mike.
I know I'm fucking up.

14:31.164 --> 14:38.088
I love Lisa, but I don't know, man.
I just don't know.

14:38.296 --> 14:40.966
What don't you know?

14:42.843 --> 14:47.014
You thought of all that pussy
you'd be giving up and you punked out.

14:47.222 --> 14:53.687
- That's what it is, Mike.
- Somebody always has to punk out.

15:01.862 --> 15:07.075
I'm sorry to break up your
all-boys meeting, but this is my house.

15:07.284 --> 15:12.164
You need to drink this.
No, hold it. God...

15:12.372 --> 15:16.418
- I'm sorry.
- This shit is cold.

15:18.253 --> 15:24.509
- We've got to go.
- My head is spinning.

15:25.761 --> 15:31.475
- I've got to chill here.
- Not here. Grab your shit and let's go.

15:31.683 --> 15:33.935
Let's go, baby.

15:35.896 --> 15:40.984
- Where are you going with my pot?
- I'll bring it back.

15:46.114 --> 15:50.077
I found myself in the damnedest
situations with Roland and Slim.

15:50.285 --> 15:52.454
My first school day was no different.

15:52.662 --> 15:57.459
Peep this thing.
Look at that booty.

15:57.668 --> 16:02.464
- I bet it's soft.
- I'd love to grab that ass.

16:02.673 --> 16:08.261
Before sex, there was grabbing booty.
For a 14-year-old, that was the best.

16:08.470 --> 16:15.602
It was like a game. You run up
and grab a girl's booty, and run.

16:18.105 --> 16:21.358
- I dare you to grab her booty.
- I'll do it.

16:21.566 --> 16:26.488
I know, but I'm asking Mike.
I know you want to do it.

16:28.073 --> 16:34.496
I will give you one dollar.
No, not you.

16:34.705 --> 16:39.209
- You touch her booty, you get a buck.
- But you've got to do it right now.

16:40.377 --> 16:41.920
Okay, it's a bet.

16:44.256 --> 16:49.177
Do it before lunch is over,
or the bet's off.

16:49.386 --> 16:51.179
Okay, man.

16:55.225 --> 16:59.604
I was ready and determined.
For a dollar, it was worth the risk.

16:59.813 --> 17:02.816
And the booty was looking good.

17:37.893 --> 17:40.312
Shit!

17:42.481 --> 17:45.650
Did you see him get hit in his face?

17:46.735 --> 17:50.781
- Damn, she clocked your ass.
- Give me my dollar.

17:56.203 --> 18:02.626
You do not know me. Don't ever
put your stinking hands on me again.

18:03.418 --> 18:07.130
And I will tell my brother.

18:07.339 --> 18:12.678
I so wanted to fit in, I never wondered
why they didn't want to grab her butt.

18:12.886 --> 18:19.518
- Her brother?
- Remember the Bloods and the Crips?

18:21.144 --> 18:24.272
- Yeah.
- Well, that nigger's a Blood.

18:24.481 --> 18:30.320
When he picks me up, he'll kick
your ass. Bet on that, punk.

18:35.992 --> 18:40.664
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't think she'd get that mad.

18:40.872 --> 18:45.085
- I guess she just tripped.
- You're all in this with me.

18:46.712 --> 18:52.175
You're tripping. You better run
out of here when school is over.

18:57.597 --> 19:02.144
Any other day,
time drags during the last period.

19:02.352 --> 19:09.234
But time was on crack today.
Maybe she'd forget about it.

19:23.290 --> 19:25.375
So much for that.

19:42.225 --> 19:43.602
Mike.

19:46.521 --> 19:50.192
- That girl's got you bugging.
- You're sweating.

19:50.400 --> 19:57.115
- You look like you're fast. Just run.
- What about tomorrow?

19:57.324 --> 20:02.829
You live to run again, fool.
Let's go. We better go this way.

20:07.793 --> 20:13.382
- Am I glad to get out of there!
- Do you wanna shoot some hoops?

20:15.092 --> 20:17.469
What's wrong with you?

20:19.054 --> 20:22.265
Funny how any hint of a fight
always gets around the whole school.

20:27.562 --> 20:32.234
- My sister tells me you grabbed her!
- I didn't mean it!

20:32.442 --> 20:37.739
- You think my sister's a ho?
- No, I think she's pretty.

20:42.494 --> 20:45.372
- Leave him alone.
- Fuck you. You want some of me?

20:45.580 --> 20:50.585
- Yeah... I guess so.
- No, this is my fight.

20:52.212 --> 20:54.423
What, nigger?

21:01.138 --> 21:05.475
I could've sworn I saw the light.
A hand reaching out to me from above.

21:05.684 --> 21:09.646
- My mistake. It was his fist.
- I told you to scare him. Stop!

21:10.522 --> 21:15.527
- Come on, man.
- Stacey, I said stop it.

21:18.113 --> 21:22.034
- Let's go, Alicia.
- Are you all right?

21:28.248 --> 21:31.209
- I'm okay.
- Let's go!

21:31.418 --> 21:33.837
I'm sorry about...

21:36.298 --> 21:41.470
- Are you all right? Damn!
- Come on!

21:41.678 --> 21:45.432
I thought he was gonna kill you.

21:45.640 --> 21:51.563
You got a hit on Stacey, though.
Ain't nobody ever done that.

21:53.899 --> 21:58.236
- Thanks for having my back.
- We always got your back, man.

21:58.445 --> 22:03.367
- We got you into this.
- We can't have you killed the first day.

22:03.575 --> 22:10.749
Let's go. But was it worth it?
Was it worth getting beat down?

22:22.344 --> 22:23.679
Yeah.

22:37.526 --> 22:41.822
- In, baby, in.
- Let's go.

22:58.630 --> 23:02.384
- Where's the aspirin at?
- In the third aisle.

23:02.592 --> 23:06.722
- Where ...?
- In the third aisle. Please!

23:10.058 --> 23:14.563
I'm getting you some Tic Tacs.
You've got dragon breath.

23:17.024 --> 23:20.902
What are you smiling about?
It's not funny.

23:21.111 --> 23:27.409
We used to come up here and grab
a bunch of mints for the school dances.

23:30.620 --> 23:36.418
- Grits?
- I used to have all the girls on my tail.

23:37.544 --> 23:39.379
No.

23:40.464 --> 23:44.259
Hold it. Put another one...

23:46.803 --> 23:51.016
Your no-dancing ass...

23:51.224 --> 23:57.356
- Mike. No dancing.
- How did it go?

23:59.775 --> 24:02.652
- Do it again.
- You're just jealous.

24:03.862 --> 24:08.408
- Man, the dances!
- They was the bomb.

24:10.202 --> 24:12.913
Put this on that nigger's tab.

24:17.751 --> 24:22.547
If the aisles could talk,
the things they would say!

24:22.756 --> 24:28.887
- Nobody's cooking those grits for you!
- If the aisles could talk, boy.

24:32.808 --> 24:37.938
After a couple of months,
I was getting adjusted to Inglewood.

24:38.146 --> 24:41.817
- Hi, baby.
- I ain't your baby.

24:43.151 --> 24:47.447
- Are you going to the dance?
- Yeah, save a dance for me.

24:49.324 --> 24:51.827
What about you, Mike?

24:53.495 --> 24:57.916
- Yeah, I'm going.
- I can't wait. It's gonna be fresh.

24:58.125 --> 25:01.878
First dance of the year, too.

25:03.547 --> 25:08.051
Leave Tracy at home.
I can't stand that girl.

25:09.678 --> 25:12.764
- What's up?
- What's up, Ro?

25:12.973 --> 25:19.479
You just missed it. Alicia just came
and asked if I was going to the dance.

25:19.688 --> 25:23.150
- So?
- She likes me.

25:23.358 --> 25:30.532
- Why else did she come up to me?
- To see if you were going to the dance.

25:31.825 --> 25:34.327
- She asked me this morning.
- So?

25:34.536 --> 25:40.375
She asked me early in the morning, so
it's probably been on her mind all night.

25:43.170 --> 25:48.550
The dance is gonna be slamming.
You'll get to show what you've got.

25:48.759 --> 25:54.514
- You can dance, right?
- Yeah, I'm like "Dance Fever".

25:56.308 --> 26:00.479
- We're gonna see on Friday.
- You can stay at my crib that night.

26:00.687 --> 26:05.400
- That's cool. I'll ask my mom.
- Yeah, me too.

26:07.444 --> 26:12.908
I had never danced a day in my life.
Not with a girl.

26:13.116 --> 26:17.287
With Alicia being there,
I couldn't look like a fool.

26:17.496 --> 26:20.957
So I figured I'd learn how to dance.

26:21.166 --> 26:25.212
Check this out. 1580 AM, KDAY.

26:37.057 --> 26:41.103
Oh, girl. You think I look good?
I think I look good.

26:42.187 --> 26:44.648
Let me show you something.

26:48.110 --> 26:50.320
Do you like that, girl?

26:53.782 --> 26:57.244
That's cool. Watch this!

26:59.913 --> 27:01.957
Girl, that wasn't it.

27:04.501 --> 27:09.214
That wasn't nothing, girl.
Let me show you something cool.

27:11.591 --> 27:14.219
You like that? You like me?

27:14.803 --> 27:19.725
You sexy girl. Come here,
let me show you something.

27:19.933 --> 27:22.811
You smell good, girl.

27:26.064 --> 27:28.650
What is going on? Michael!

27:32.696 --> 27:34.531
Mom.

27:37.659 --> 27:41.788
I was just dancing.
There's a dance on Friday.

27:41.997 --> 27:47.002
- So you did the freak with a rabbit?
- I've never danced before.

27:47.210 --> 27:52.424
What about Deborah's wedding?
You were so cute.

27:52.632 --> 27:59.556
- I was four. It's different now.
- Look at my little boy growing up.

28:00.766 --> 28:05.103
That's the latest step.
It's called "the hip".

28:12.194 --> 28:16.615
- So how's the job going?
- It's going well. The people seem nice.

28:16.823 --> 28:18.533
Good.

28:21.661 --> 28:25.749
- So who is she?
- What?

28:25.957 --> 28:30.212
Only a woman can make a man
do the crazy stuff you were just doing.

28:31.880 --> 28:38.220
- Come on. It ain't nobody.
- Whatever, boy.

28:38.428 --> 28:43.517
I'm glad to see you like it here.
We're gonna stay here for a while.

28:44.893 --> 28:48.689
Anyway, I think you need
a little more practice.

28:50.148 --> 28:53.235
- Just keep it down.
- Okay, Ma.

28:56.029 --> 28:57.572
This is it!

28:59.574 --> 29:06.081
- Where'd you get that sweet hat?
- Carolina Blue in North Carolina.

29:06.289 --> 29:12.129
Why are you wearing it like
a poindexter? Let me help you out.

29:13.714 --> 29:19.845
- That's how the ballers wear it.
- Everybody got their pen and paper?

29:20.053 --> 29:23.432
- A pen?
- To get girls' numbers.

29:23.640 --> 29:27.436
Whoever gets the most numbers
gets a dollar.

29:28.603 --> 29:35.318
- I don't have a pen.
- Here, I always carry a spare.

29:35.527 --> 29:41.241
- But I'm gonna get the most anyway.
- You're crazy.

29:41.992 --> 29:46.538
It was all new to me. I'd never danced
with a girl, let alone got her number.

29:46.747 --> 29:50.292
Hold on. We didn't do the breath test.

29:52.502 --> 29:56.631
- Shit!
- I'm cool.

29:56.840 --> 30:01.011
But for how long? Have you got
some gum, candy, Binaca?

30:01.219 --> 30:04.639
I need something.
My breath is kicking like Bruce Lee.

30:08.435 --> 30:14.483
- Let's go to the mini-market.
- Hell, no. That's like Blood central.

30:14.691 --> 30:19.780
I am not walking in there
with my breath smelling all tart.

30:21.198 --> 30:23.325
Let's just go.

30:26.411 --> 30:29.206
All right, man.

30:31.541 --> 30:36.963
- Take that hat off. It's got blue in it.
- It's light blue.

30:37.172 --> 30:41.843
- Take it off.
- What up, blood?

30:47.808 --> 30:52.938
- My fault.
- Damn, that was too close.

30:53.146 --> 30:56.066
I keep forgetting you're the rookie.

30:56.274 --> 30:59.361
- Here are the refreshments.
- Tic Tacs.

30:59.569 --> 31:06.785
- Good idea, but bad flavor.
- What's wrong with orange?

31:06.993 --> 31:13.041
- School him.
- Tic Tacs are small, but powerful.

31:13.250 --> 31:20.090
Always go small. You might be talking
to some girl, and the candy falls out.

31:20.298 --> 31:26.346
- You'd look stupid.
- But Tic Tacs are hard to notice.

31:26.555 --> 31:32.811
Especially in the dance, right?
And fruit flavors are always bad.

31:33.020 --> 31:38.150
Like Harvard professors. They had
breath mints down to a science.

31:38.358 --> 31:44.531
- That's important for slow dancing.
- What about gum?

31:44.740 --> 31:47.034
I got this.

31:47.242 --> 31:54.207
Always remember, when dealing
with females... Suck, never chew.

31:58.128 --> 32:02.549
- I'll get the green.
- I'll get the white.

32:03.300 --> 32:05.969
Let me get a soda.

32:06.178 --> 32:11.183
- The party started an hour ago.
- We got time.

32:12.351 --> 32:16.813
Give me the money.
Shut the fuck up and move!

32:18.482 --> 32:21.360
- What the hell are you doing?
- Get down.

32:23.945 --> 32:27.282
- What's going on?
- Check it out.

32:27.491 --> 32:33.413
- Not this time. You check it out.
- Let's all check it out.

32:36.416 --> 32:40.837
- Shit, they're robbing the place.
- No shit! As if I didn't know.

32:41.046 --> 32:47.886
- We got to get out of here.
- Let's stay and let them rob the place.

32:48.095 --> 32:52.724
- Then maybe they'll leave.
- Do you know where we're at?

32:52.933 --> 32:57.646
Where's the other one?
I think he's coming.

32:57.854 --> 33:00.607
I've got something for his ass.

33:01.858 --> 33:05.529
Hold on, man. Oh, shit!

33:07.447 --> 33:12.536
- Look. There's someone in here.
- Bring them here.

33:12.744 --> 33:15.539
- I just wanted some Tic Tacs.
- Get in the front.

33:18.250 --> 33:20.293
Hurry up!

33:23.547 --> 33:27.592
They ain't nothing.
They go to school with my sister.

33:29.177 --> 33:33.306
- Stacey?
- Don't say my name.

33:33.515 --> 33:37.769
He's got a heart, though.
When I beat him, he took it like a G.

33:38.603 --> 33:43.859
Are you going to the dance?
I remember them dances.

33:44.067 --> 33:47.446
Don't fuck with me.
Get on the ground!

33:48.822 --> 33:53.702
- Do you little niggers want something?
- I was kind of thirsty.

33:53.910 --> 33:57.205
- Go and get it.
- No, we're cool.

33:58.498 --> 34:04.963
At least let me give you a ride
to the dance. It's the least I can do.

34:05.839 --> 34:09.551
You're wasting time. Come on.

34:09.760 --> 34:11.928
I'm taking you to the dance.

34:24.024 --> 34:28.235
- Did you get some more Zig-Zags?
- I forgot.

34:28.445 --> 34:35.243
- That's the reason we went there.
- I went to get some rubbers.

34:36.370 --> 34:39.915
- Do you want a hit?
- No, we're cool.

34:42.250 --> 34:46.088
- Are you Muslims or something?
- No, we just don't do that.

34:49.882 --> 34:55.263
I'm just trying to be generous. I don't
understand youngsters nowadays.

34:55.472 --> 34:58.225
Pass that shit this way.

34:58.433 --> 35:02.854
Fuck you. You ain't getting no Zig-Zags,
you ain't getting no drig-drag.

35:07.109 --> 35:11.154
That shit rhymed, nigger.
I should be a rapper.

35:12.030 --> 35:15.158
I'm harder than DMC.

35:16.243 --> 35:20.455
I'm serious. I'd make
a whole album about smoking weed.

35:20.664 --> 35:24.001
Nobody wants to buy that.

35:24.793 --> 35:29.798
We'll get some beats like these
and sell millions.

35:30.007 --> 35:32.718
Name me one race
that don't smoke bud.

35:35.470 --> 35:40.559
I'd sell millions.
I'd call it "The Weed Album".

35:42.978 --> 35:47.357
Getting contact back here?
Shit, the police!

35:47.566 --> 35:52.571
- Put the gun under the seat.
- Open the windows.

35:52.779 --> 35:56.199
- Open the windows.
- Don't panic.

35:58.493 --> 36:02.622
I'm just taking you to the dance.

36:19.890 --> 36:25.395
- Is there a problem?
- Your tail light is out. License, please.

36:26.355 --> 36:31.151
- Slowly.
- Here you go, sir.

36:38.700 --> 36:42.704
- Whose car is this?
- Mine. But it's in my mother's name.

36:42.913 --> 36:47.459
- Your last names don't match.
- She just remarried.

36:56.718 --> 36:59.513
Stop crying!

36:59.721 --> 37:05.102
It's amazing how tables can turn.
At the store, Boo was so tough, -

37:05.310 --> 37:08.438
- but now they were kids like us.

37:11.358 --> 37:14.569
Everybody out. Now!

37:17.072 --> 37:20.534
Put your hands behind your heads.

37:20.742 --> 37:26.581
Against the wall.
Get your hands behind your heads.

37:28.417 --> 37:33.588
Get those legs apart.
I don't want to hear a sound.

37:36.174 --> 37:40.470
Don't move. If you've got any
weapons or contraband, tell me now.

37:40.679 --> 37:43.432
Spread them.

37:44.975 --> 37:46.518
Get them apart.

37:47.561 --> 37:52.607
We're going to jail.
I'm going to be on "Scared Straight".

37:54.693 --> 37:57.154
Open those legs.

38:11.460 --> 38:16.340
- They're clean.
- All this for a tail light?

38:16.548 --> 38:21.887
- Speak only when you're spoken to.
- You heard the officer!

38:22.095 --> 38:24.264
- Shut it up.
- Stacey, shut up.

38:44.534 --> 38:46.119
What's going on?

38:47.871 --> 38:52.334
It's just my allergies, sir. I'm sorry.

38:58.090 --> 39:00.634
Unit C6. We'll take care of it.

39:00.842 --> 39:04.638
God, if you get us out of this,
I'll never grab a booty again.

39:04.846 --> 39:07.557
Davis, let's move.

39:09.267 --> 39:11.269
Turn around.

39:13.063 --> 39:17.734
You can go now.
And you, greasy one...

39:19.486 --> 39:21.530
Get that tail light fixed.

39:24.032 --> 39:30.163
Prayer really works. The robbery
they just committed got us off.

39:30.372 --> 39:33.375
Life's funny sometimes.
As long as it doesn't laugh at you.

39:33.583 --> 39:39.840
Get in the back, cry-baby.
These kids have more heart than you!

39:40.048 --> 39:45.637
- I'm riding in the front.
- Get in the back or walk home!

39:48.432 --> 39:52.185
In the front, homeboy.
You, get up in the front.

39:56.064 --> 39:59.317
What were you thinking, alcoholic?

39:59.526 --> 40:03.280
Popping Tic Tacs
when we got pulled over.

40:03.488 --> 40:09.202
I was thinking that this could be
my last meal as a free man.

40:09.411 --> 40:11.580
You smell.

40:13.582 --> 40:20.422
He was thinking it might be a female
cop and he could sweet talk us out of it.

40:23.925 --> 40:29.806
- Get some more Tic Tacs, just in case.
- Don't doubt the mack skills.

40:30.015 --> 40:33.060
It's got me out of a lot of shit.

40:35.687 --> 40:38.440
Keep the change, homey.

40:42.903 --> 40:46.073
Get out and go have some fun.

40:48.700 --> 40:52.079
Little man, let me talk to you.

40:58.669 --> 41:05.717
I apologies for beating your ass.
But I was protecting my sister.

41:07.552 --> 41:11.306
She's cute. There's always
some nigger trying to fuck with her.

41:15.268 --> 41:18.480
Yeah, I know. It's cool.

41:21.692 --> 41:24.361
You like her, don't you?

41:26.822 --> 41:30.492
It's cool.
I ain't gonna do nothing to you.

41:35.080 --> 41:38.375
- I guess.
- You guess?

41:42.504 --> 41:44.840
Well, yeah, I do.

41:46.425 --> 41:50.554
- What's your name?
- Mike.

41:50.762 --> 41:54.808
Big Mike. You got good taste.

41:55.017 --> 41:59.062
She's cool. She's smart, too.

41:59.271 --> 42:05.444
She loves that Luther Vandross song
"If This World Were Mine".

42:05.652 --> 42:11.324
If they happen to play that,
I want you to get your dance.

42:11.533 --> 42:14.619
I'm serious, man.

42:17.998 --> 42:23.295
Go and have some fun... Big Mike.

42:35.182 --> 42:39.061
Stay your cry-baby ass in the back!

42:42.230 --> 42:46.485
- Are you all right?
- What did he say?

42:47.819 --> 42:54.451
- He just wanted to know my name.
- I thought he was gonna get you.

42:54.659 --> 42:59.456
No, man. Let's just get up
in this party, finally.

43:27.234 --> 43:33.699
The party of all parties. I'd never seen
anything like this in North Carolina.

43:33.907 --> 43:39.162
Hormones jumping, music pumping,
booties shaking... paradise!

43:42.708 --> 43:46.586
I'm gonna be freaking
all the fine skeezers up in here tonight.

43:47.713 --> 43:51.258
Check it out, Ro. Go, Ro!

43:53.677 --> 43:55.887
That's my boy!

43:57.639 --> 44:01.643
Lay back and let's see who's here.

44:01.852 --> 44:06.732
Look at that freak right there.
That booty is nice!

44:08.442 --> 44:11.486
I'm dancing with her.
You get her friend.

44:13.488 --> 44:17.284
The power of horniness is amazing.

44:17.492 --> 44:21.496
We were just in a robbery, but
it was like nothing had happened.

44:21.705 --> 44:25.584
Ladies, you want to dance with us?

44:28.503 --> 44:31.923
I was so horny I forgot I couldn't dance.

44:32.132 --> 44:34.634
What are you doing?

44:34.843 --> 44:39.765
I was looking like a fool.
I'll just get into my own thing.

44:39.973 --> 44:41.767
Hey, watch this.

44:44.311 --> 44:46.271
Or do you like this?

44:58.492 --> 45:02.788
Mike, get it! "Dance Fever", huh?

45:04.581 --> 45:07.626
I'm getting tired. I'm gonna stop.

45:41.827 --> 45:44.287
This party is fly, man!

45:45.831 --> 45:50.043
One from each corner of the room.
Ro ain't messing with me.

45:50.252 --> 45:53.088
Ro, how many?

45:54.381 --> 45:58.427
Six? Damn, I've only got four.

46:00.220 --> 46:05.434
I'd have more if we hadn't come late.
How many you got, Mike?

46:05.642 --> 46:09.479
- None.
- What?

46:09.688 --> 46:14.067
You got to get up off that bench
if you want some numbers.

46:14.276 --> 46:19.489
- He's waiting for Alicia.
- Forget it. Everybody wants her.

46:19.698 --> 46:22.451
Including me.

46:22.659 --> 46:29.207
- I'll tell her you want to talk to her.
- No, don't.

46:29.416 --> 46:35.630
- No, for real. Come on.
- I'm just trying to help you.

46:35.839 --> 46:42.429
- Why not hook me up?
- Why don't both of you talk to her?

46:42.637 --> 46:49.478
See all these honeys?
That one is about to be number seven.

46:49.686 --> 46:52.522
- Where?
- Right there.

46:55.567 --> 46:59.446
You're all gonna owe me some money
after tonight. I'll get it from you later.

46:59.654 --> 47:05.827
I won't pay for that big-headed girl.
I got to get some more numbers.

47:17.214 --> 47:24.596
We're gonna slow it down now.
Grab a fine lady and get close.

47:29.935 --> 47:32.771
That's the song!

47:43.782 --> 47:50.205
I've got to find her. If I could
get just this one dance...

48:05.178 --> 48:09.725
I expected her to be dancing
with someone else.

48:11.768 --> 48:16.440
Then I'd have an excuse
for not asking.

48:27.659 --> 48:32.914
Maybe I should think about this.
I did grab her butt that day.

48:33.123 --> 48:37.461
But that was two months ago,
and she's been cool ever since.

49:04.321 --> 49:07.783
- Hey, Alicia.
- What's up, Mike?

49:07.991 --> 49:14.081
I just wanted to say hi.
You haven't been alone all night.

49:16.666 --> 49:22.464
I never really did get
to apologies for the bet.

49:22.673 --> 49:29.054
Oh, that's what you get for hanging
around Roland and his nasty behind.

49:30.222 --> 49:33.475
I was nervous as a hooker in church.

49:33.684 --> 49:39.272
- I really like this song.
- It's a beautiful song.

49:40.941 --> 49:43.151
Do you want to dance?

49:44.861 --> 49:46.697
Yeah, sure.

50:00.669 --> 50:05.257
My heart was beating 100 times
a minute. She smelled so good.

50:05.465 --> 50:08.885
All I could think of was,
"Don't get hard"!

50:11.638 --> 50:13.557
Look.

50:22.858 --> 50:25.027
I love this part.

50:48.759 --> 50:52.304
- Why don't you go dance with her?
- You, too!

50:53.388 --> 50:54.973
Can't I call you?

50:58.769 --> 51:03.190
Shit, I can't hold it any longer.
Captain, she's going to blow.

51:04.441 --> 51:09.029
- I was in full salute.
- You okay, Mike?

51:09.237 --> 51:13.367
Yeah, this is how we do it
in North Carolina.

51:22.709 --> 51:26.588
This is how we do it in L.A.

51:27.714 --> 51:32.052
The party's over. Time to go home.

51:36.139 --> 51:38.350
Walk me outside?

51:40.394 --> 51:42.688
Yeah, sure.

51:48.276 --> 51:53.615
- I had so much fun.
- Me, too.

51:56.660 --> 52:02.374
- I guess I'll talk to you at school.
- Why not this weekend?

52:04.543 --> 52:11.508
- You're asking me for my number?
- Yeah, I guess so.

52:11.717 --> 52:15.721
- You guess so?
- Okay, I am.

52:21.476 --> 52:23.437
Here.

52:46.752 --> 52:50.213
How the hell did you do that?

52:51.965 --> 52:58.430
- I told you not to worry about me.
- Whatever. I got seven numbers.

52:58.638 --> 53:04.269
The last one wasn't cute,
but she had a body. I won.

53:04.478 --> 53:11.443
- I got seven, too. It's a tie.
- How many did you get?

53:12.903 --> 53:15.322
Just one.

53:16.782 --> 53:21.870
- Alicia? Damn!
- I knew you danced with her, but damn!

53:22.079 --> 53:28.126
That number is worth ten of
those skeezers. You won, Big Mike.

53:29.336 --> 53:31.963
You're taking all my money.

53:34.508 --> 53:38.095
I still don't know
how you swung that.

53:38.303 --> 53:43.558
- That's why I'm Big Mike.
- Don't act stupid.

53:46.728 --> 53:52.693
- I'm forgetting about the wedding.
- What do you want us to tell them?

53:52.901 --> 53:56.905
- I don't know.
- Should I tell them it's off?

53:57.114 --> 54:02.494
- No!
- What then? They're all waiting.

54:02.703 --> 54:06.748
- I need some time to think.
- You had time before you proposed.

54:06.957 --> 54:13.463
- I did think.
- Grow up and act responsible.

54:13.672 --> 54:18.593
- I don't want to wonder "what if".
- You won't, because we know it.

54:21.096 --> 54:24.933
You need to face that, man.

54:28.520 --> 54:34.609
- Pull the car over.
- No! I'm getting your ass there.

54:34.818 --> 54:38.864
- We'll stick by you no matter what.
- Tell him to stop the car.

54:39.072 --> 54:42.784
Stop running...
Are you all right?

54:42.993 --> 54:46.038
- Mike, don't even start.
- He don't look too good.

54:49.875 --> 54:51.251
Get the window.

55:00.010 --> 55:02.179
This is my new shit!

55:05.932 --> 55:08.018
Look at this shit!

55:08.226 --> 55:12.439
These are Ferragamos!
They cost $300!

55:12.647 --> 55:19.196
- How much did you pay for them?
- They're worth 300! Stupid ass!

55:19.404 --> 55:26.036
- Chill, man. It's over.
- Get back in. You're marrying Lisa.

55:26.244 --> 55:30.916
- Are you gonna force him?
- I never said I don't want to marry her.

55:31.124 --> 55:37.589
See? He's crazy.
You're crazy, a drunk and a punk!

55:39.341 --> 55:44.346
- Why do I have to be a punk?
- Ro, step the fuck back.

55:44.554 --> 55:49.559
I will beat your little ass up.
You fucking midget.

55:50.769 --> 55:54.147
Have you lost your mind?

55:54.356 --> 55:58.360
I will body-slam your ass.
Are you calm?

55:58.568 --> 56:03.156
Are you calm?
Ro... stop playing.

56:04.324 --> 56:06.576
Both of you are acting like punks.

56:06.785 --> 56:12.374
The wedding is or isn't going to happen
today. Only you know the answer.

56:12.582 --> 56:16.169
Don't let cold feet fuck this up, Ro.

56:17.796 --> 56:21.758
- Are you gonna do this or not?
- I guess so.

56:21.967 --> 56:25.137
We ain't asking you to get doughnuts!

56:25.345 --> 56:29.141
That's good enough for now.
If he says "no" in the church...

56:29.349 --> 56:32.561
- We got to get cleaned up.
- Where?

56:38.108 --> 56:41.903
Hell, no. No, no, no.

56:42.112 --> 56:48.493
Just go. Get this shit away from...
What the fuck is that smell?

56:48.702 --> 56:52.914
Ro got carsick. We need to clean up.

56:53.123 --> 56:57.085
Gas stations have fresh paper towels.

56:57.294 --> 57:00.005
This ain't no damn commercial.

57:01.631 --> 57:05.594
Ro gets married in two hours.
We really need your help.

57:08.263 --> 57:09.598
Please.

57:12.100 --> 57:16.980
I'm doing this for her.
Not for you and especially not for him.

57:17.189 --> 57:24.988
- She must be going through hell.
- If he gets cleaned up, she won't know.

57:25.197 --> 57:30.452
- Can you clean the tuxedos?
- Do I look like a maid?

57:30.660 --> 57:36.375
Take them to the cleaners!
I've got some of my man's clothes.

57:38.085 --> 57:41.338
- I'm first in the shower.
- Shower?

57:41.546 --> 57:44.925
There's a hose in the backyard.

57:45.133 --> 57:47.761
- We ain't washing no dogs.
- Says who?

57:49.513 --> 57:53.350
- What choice have we got?
- Through the back way!

57:55.936 --> 58:01.066
- You stink. Go through the back.
- Like Benson?

58:02.234 --> 58:04.820
- That's bad.
- So are you.

58:09.616 --> 58:10.951
Thank you.

58:15.997 --> 58:21.336
- Damn, this shit is cold.
- Maybe it'll snap Ro back to normal.

58:23.463 --> 58:25.590
Stop playing!

58:32.222 --> 58:35.225
Damn you all. Stop playing.

58:38.979 --> 58:41.523
I see not a lot has changed
since high school.

58:41.732 --> 58:46.236
This is shrinkage, right?
Back me up, you all.

58:53.702 --> 59:00.625
- The joke's over. Pass the clothes.
- What clothes? Oh, my God.

59:01.835 --> 59:04.671
We look like three nerds.

59:04.880 --> 59:11.553
Why is this so painful?
I'm talking about marriage.

59:11.762 --> 59:16.433
It's like you're going to the electric
chair. It's supposed to be special.

59:16.641 --> 59:20.145
- It ain't that simple.
- Do you love her?

59:21.271 --> 59:23.523
- Yeah.
- Then it's simple.

59:23.732 --> 59:28.153
Getting drunk and dirty, fighting,
just so you can act like a schoolboy.

59:28.362 --> 59:33.283
- Thank you, Oprah!
- Can't take the heat?

59:33.492 --> 59:37.245
I can take the heat fine.
That fool's getting married.

59:40.082 --> 59:42.376
But you do look good in them jeans.

59:51.218 --> 59:54.262
Thanks for putting up with me, Tanya.

59:55.514 --> 01:00:00.435
- That's for the bride.
- I deserve that.

01:00:09.569 --> 01:00:12.322
- Ladies.
- Hi there.

01:00:13.448 --> 01:00:18.120
- We need this done in an hour.
- What would you like cleaned?

01:00:27.963 --> 01:00:34.011
Find a church. It'll take a miracle
to have this cleaned in an hour.

01:00:35.887 --> 01:00:38.807
Please, we're going to a wedding.

01:00:39.016 --> 01:00:42.060
We need you to work a miracle.

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:48.608
I'll see what I can do.
But I won't promise you anything.

01:00:48.817 --> 01:00:52.988
- Here. One hour.
- Thank you.

01:00:56.616 --> 01:01:03.248
- Think we'll get there on time?
- We've got two hours.

01:01:05.125 --> 01:01:10.005
You want this last piece?
You're not getting it. I'll take it.

01:01:10.213 --> 01:01:14.885
- Why did you ask me, then?
- I didn't ask you.

01:01:15.093 --> 01:01:19.222
I asked Mike for the same reason
you proposed to Lisa. It sounds nice.

01:01:20.849 --> 01:01:25.645
- That's cold.
- I thought you'd understand my doubts.

01:01:25.854 --> 01:01:30.609
After the way you treated me
when I proposed.

01:01:30.817 --> 01:01:38.450
When I said I'd propose, you said:
"Why are you busting up the group?"

01:01:38.658 --> 01:01:44.623
You just shouldn't follow her. She
should move where you are. Be a man!

01:01:44.831 --> 01:01:51.129
That's bull. She has a good job,
so I'm gonna follow her.

01:01:51.338 --> 01:01:54.341
Nigger, you need some panties.

01:01:55.425 --> 01:01:59.054
Mike, tell this ignorant Negro, please.

01:02:00.013 --> 01:02:06.228
I'll put it this way. I see what
you're saying, but Slim got a point.

01:02:06.436 --> 01:02:09.106
What about Alicia?

01:02:09.314 --> 01:02:14.903
What about her? That was high school.
She went to Columbia, I got into S.C.

01:02:15.112 --> 01:02:22.744
- You also got into New York University.
- Damn, he's right.

01:02:22.953 --> 01:02:28.792
So now what?
Stay, let's talk about this.

01:02:29.001 --> 01:02:32.629
Let's talk about Alicia. Lying bitch.

01:02:35.257 --> 01:02:41.013
We've been in the Wood for years.
You're talking about leaving?

01:02:41.221 --> 01:02:46.184
- I'm getting married.
- What time? So I can be there.

01:02:46.393 --> 01:02:51.440
Nobody said a thing
when you went to Italy.

01:02:52.107 --> 01:02:55.652
- That was to play ball. I love ball.
- I love Lisa.

01:02:55.861 --> 01:02:58.864
Then why aren't we at the wedding?

01:03:00.532 --> 01:03:03.744
"Because I'm a punk."
That's the answer, Ro.

01:03:06.538 --> 01:03:13.420
I can solve all your problems. We're
gonna do this the old-school style.

01:03:13.628 --> 01:03:18.967
- I've got Jennifer Lopez.
- No, I've got J.L. here.

01:03:19.176 --> 01:03:24.514
- You've got Janet Jackson.
- I always had Janet Jackson.

01:03:24.723 --> 01:03:29.644
- You've got Lisa Davis.
- Your player card's revoked.

01:03:30.854 --> 01:03:34.858
- Let's do this.
- One nice one.

01:03:36.234 --> 01:03:41.573
- That's me. I'm the closest.
- You always do that!

01:03:45.035 --> 01:03:48.705
- Remember the bet?
- Do you, Mike?

01:03:48.914 --> 01:03:51.166
I do. Do you?

01:04:01.385 --> 01:04:05.597
St. Bernard's High School.
Lots of memories here.

01:04:05.806 --> 01:04:12.396
High school was a different world,
but with the same objective: Girls.

01:04:12.604 --> 01:04:17.526
High school was nice. Still beautiful
girls, but instead of just booty -

01:04:17.734 --> 01:04:22.781
- they had legs, hips, breasts...
And I'm a breast man.

01:04:25.992 --> 01:04:27.911
How you doing?

01:04:30.956 --> 01:04:35.168
- What's up?
- Checking out some fine-assed girls.

01:04:37.045 --> 01:04:40.340
First day of school is always the best.

01:04:41.675 --> 01:04:43.802
Go grab a piece of booty.

01:04:44.011 --> 01:04:50.308
It's full of possibilities. For us, that
meant sex, the wild thing, the nasty.

01:04:50.517 --> 01:04:55.313
- See you later.
- Leave the waddy-haired girls alone.

01:04:55.522 --> 01:05:01.486
- You're jealous.
- Stop calling girls that, man.

01:05:01.695 --> 01:05:04.489
Look at that.

01:05:08.326 --> 01:05:12.581
- Yeah, so?
- You gonna let Eric mack your girl?

01:05:17.461 --> 01:05:20.088
- Funny.
- What's up?

01:05:20.297 --> 01:05:23.425
After that dance,
me and Alicia talked.

01:05:23.633 --> 01:05:29.598
We were a couple for the standard
three weeks. But we stayed friends.

01:05:29.806 --> 01:05:34.353
- We're juniors now. Buckle down.
- Yeah. Ain't it a trip, though?

01:05:34.561 --> 01:05:41.026
- Meet me at the library at five.
- Why? It's the first day of school.

01:05:41.234 --> 01:05:49.234
- Ms Quiano is giving us a test.
- For real? I'll meet you there.

01:05:51.036 --> 01:05:54.748
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah, me too.

01:05:56.166 --> 01:06:02.255
That girl is still fine.
You should've stayed with that.

01:06:02.464 --> 01:06:07.552
Come on. I'm onto bigger
and better things now.

01:06:07.761 --> 01:06:12.182
- Like what?
- Like your mama, nigger!

01:06:21.066 --> 01:06:27.823
- It's on me.
- You're crazy. It's on me, man.

01:06:28.031 --> 01:06:33.161
- Mike, spin it again.
- No, this isn't for real.

01:06:33.370 --> 01:06:38.583
Yeah, I'm tired of not getting
any coochie. We're juniors, man.

01:06:38.792 --> 01:06:45.757
I need something real. Females get
way too much power with this shit.

01:06:45.966 --> 01:06:51.179
It's like they ain't giving it up.
I've been after Monica for two months.

01:06:51.388 --> 01:06:55.434
- Damn.
- It's time to move on, man.

01:06:57.394 --> 01:07:03.108
I'm not warming her up to let the
next nigger hit the jackpot. I'm close.

01:07:04.526 --> 01:07:09.865
This has to be our year.
We're the head niggers now. Juniors.

01:07:10.073 --> 01:07:15.120
You're on varsity
and I'm looking better every day.

01:07:16.288 --> 01:07:20.500
Nigger, as pretty as you are,
you still ain't getting no pussy.

01:07:23.587 --> 01:07:28.800
- I bet I'll be the first to get some.
- I'm gonna get Monica soon.

01:07:29.009 --> 01:07:35.724
- Put your money where your dick is.
- Yes, in your nostrils!

01:07:36.516 --> 01:07:42.147
You're always clowning.
It's because you know I'll win the bet.

01:07:43.732 --> 01:07:47.402
The first one to get some pussy
gets five bucks.

01:07:48.904 --> 01:07:51.031
But to keep it from going on forever, -

01:07:51.239 --> 01:07:58.121
- if in a month no one gets none,
we put in five bucks more.

01:07:59.456 --> 01:08:04.461
- I'm with it.
- Okay, I'm in.

01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:06.838
Let the games begin, baby.

01:08:11.426 --> 01:08:13.762
When are we gonna make this real?

01:08:13.970 --> 01:08:18.684
- Stop, Slim!
- Why don't you want to do it?

01:08:27.984 --> 01:08:32.656
I was just thinking
we could make this a physical thing.

01:08:35.450 --> 01:08:36.785
Hello?

01:08:36.993 --> 01:08:41.247
- I'm not ready.
- How long have we been going out?

01:08:41.456 --> 01:08:43.959
A week and a half.

01:08:45.711 --> 01:08:49.131
- What are you doing?
- Let's do something else.

01:08:53.218 --> 01:08:54.970
We could make love.

01:08:55.178 --> 01:09:00.767
- Don't say that. You don't love me.
- It sounds better than "bone".

01:09:00.975 --> 01:09:05.522
You want me to let you
put that inside me? That's so nasty.

01:09:08.191 --> 01:09:15.323
I could get blue balls. My shit
could just swell up and explode.

01:09:19.870 --> 01:09:26.209
You remember that fool Andrew?
That nigger still ain't walking.

01:09:26.417 --> 01:09:31.840
- Nasty? It's natural. Suck on it.
- You need to back up. That's nasty.

01:09:32.049 --> 01:09:35.676
- Why wait for what you can get now?
- Because it's in the Bible.

01:09:35.886 --> 01:09:40.265
You're already on the wrong path.
Finish it.

01:09:40.474 --> 01:09:44.185
Do you think I'm a ho?

01:09:44.394 --> 01:09:49.941
You let Terry bone.
I look better than that.

01:09:50.149 --> 01:09:54.905
Come on, girl.
I'll buy you something. What you want?

01:10:00.911 --> 01:10:05.540
I had a girlfriend.
But Alicia was my friend, you know?

01:10:05.749 --> 01:10:10.045
We could talk about anything.
Boyfriends, girlfriends... It was cool.

01:10:10.253 --> 01:10:16.635
- Why say that?
- Why not? Explain her reasoning.

01:10:16.843 --> 01:10:21.098
We're doing everything but it.
What's up?

01:10:22.557 --> 01:10:25.268
Doing it ain't easy.

01:10:26.561 --> 01:10:32.025
You don't just walk up to a girl and say:
"What's up? Can we get busy?."

01:10:32.234 --> 01:10:37.739
- Everything's got to be right, right?
- Right, it's got to be special.

01:10:37.948 --> 01:10:42.536
- I heard that before.
- Well, hear it again.

01:10:44.413 --> 01:10:51.628
- Don't trick her into doing it.
- I don't need tricks. My game is strong.

01:10:51.837 --> 01:10:58.719
- Then how come you ain't getting any?
- Oh, you got jokes.

01:10:58.927 --> 01:11:03.557
Girls act like they don't want it
as bad as we do.

01:11:03.765 --> 01:11:07.519
- That is not true.
- Yes, it is.

01:11:07.728 --> 01:11:10.731
You ain't got nothing to say.

01:11:12.482 --> 01:11:17.237
Maybe you need to find somebody
who wants it as bad as you do.

01:11:22.284 --> 01:11:24.619
Maybe I do.

01:11:37.007 --> 01:11:40.677
Let's go.
We won't get no studying done.

01:11:40.886 --> 01:11:44.514
- All right.
- And you need to work on your game.

01:11:49.311 --> 01:11:52.856
What are you wearing to homecoming?

01:11:53.065 --> 01:11:59.154
- I got a suit from last year's...
- Are you too cheap to buy a new suit?

01:11:59.363 --> 01:12:04.409
Times are rough.
I ain't trying to spend no more money.

01:12:05.869 --> 01:12:13.210
- So, are you going with... Eric?
- You know his name. Come on.

01:12:15.629 --> 01:12:19.841
Yeah, I'm going with Eric.
You're going with Kim, right?

01:12:20.050 --> 01:12:23.220
- Monica.
- Oh, yeah.

01:12:25.180 --> 01:12:30.310
- Is Eric someone special?
- You tell me. You play ball with him.

01:12:31.603 --> 01:12:37.067
- He's cool. If that's what you want.
- He's all right.

01:12:37.275 --> 01:12:42.698
- Is Bonita somebody special?
- Monica.

01:12:42.906 --> 01:12:44.866
Monica.

01:12:47.202 --> 01:12:51.581
She's special enough.
I knew she'd say yes if I asked her.

01:12:51.790 --> 01:12:55.711
Did you ask her
only because you knew she'd say yes?

01:12:59.464 --> 01:13:03.593
- Are you afraid of rejection?
- Yep.

01:13:05.762 --> 01:13:11.643
- All the brothers ask you...
- Not all the brothers.

01:13:15.897 --> 01:13:20.986
- What are you wearing to the dance?
- A little fly red dress.

01:13:21.194 --> 01:13:26.241
- Do you wanna see it?
- Yeah, of course.

01:13:33.248 --> 01:13:34.583
My room.

01:13:34.791 --> 01:13:39.421
Her bedroom.
I always wanted to get up here.

01:13:42.632 --> 01:13:45.969
- Ready?
- Yeah.

01:13:48.055 --> 01:13:49.973
Here it is.

01:13:52.017 --> 01:13:56.813
- Do you like it?
- Yeah, it's beautiful.

01:13:57.022 --> 01:13:58.357
Thank you.

01:14:00.609 --> 01:14:07.449
- Where's your mom and Stacey?
- My mom's working late.

01:14:07.657 --> 01:14:13.705
- Stacey's out running the streets again.
- Down, boy.

01:14:14.623 --> 01:14:21.171
We're slow jamming tonight.
If you've got any dedications, call us.

01:14:21.380 --> 01:14:25.926
This next one goes out to Lisa
from Terence. Glenita, I love you.

01:14:26.134 --> 01:14:29.888
- How sweet.
- Here's Luther Vandross.

01:14:32.099 --> 01:14:34.601
Not Luther.

01:14:37.604 --> 01:14:41.149
I love this.
Do you remember this song?

01:14:41.358 --> 01:14:43.944
Yeah.

01:14:44.152 --> 01:14:51.660
- La Tijera, 1986.
- La Tijera, 1986. See?

01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:58.125
- I remember when I first met you.
- You met me with your fist.

01:14:58.333 --> 01:15:04.047
- Right. You and that stupid bet.
- That bet wasn't stupid.

01:15:04.256 --> 01:15:07.718
It was. That's why you got the fist.

01:15:09.636 --> 01:15:15.559
You three probably bet on
who'd get the booty first, didn't you?

01:15:20.981 --> 01:15:24.151
- Booty first?
- Yeah.

01:15:24.359 --> 01:15:28.613
Come on, that's stupid.

01:15:31.575 --> 01:15:36.204
Whatever.
You and your little nasty friends.

01:15:41.793 --> 01:15:46.548
- Do you remember that dance?
- Yeah, I remember.

01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:53.221
I remember you standing there.
Just singing.

01:15:55.557 --> 01:16:01.021
I just had to ask you,
even though I was scared to death.

01:16:01.938 --> 01:16:04.483
I'm glad you asked me, Mike.

01:16:07.611 --> 01:16:13.283
You dance pretty good
for a guy with two left feet.

01:16:13.492 --> 01:16:15.994
Oh, really?

01:16:16.203 --> 01:16:19.539
I think I've improved. For real.

01:16:20.916 --> 01:16:27.881
- You want to find out?
- Do you want to dance?

01:16:28.090 --> 01:16:32.803
- Right now?
- While the mood is right.

01:16:45.607 --> 01:16:47.693
Wait, wait.

01:16:52.155 --> 01:16:55.367
This is how we do it in North Carolina.

01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:15.929
You know, I still love this part.

01:18:09.941 --> 01:18:13.028
My God, is this really about to happen?

01:18:16.448 --> 01:18:18.992
Shit, it is.

01:18:19.201 --> 01:18:23.455
- You've got protection, right?
- Yeah, it's here.

01:18:25.665 --> 01:18:30.045
One of Slim's condoms that's
six months old, but work with me.

01:18:35.217 --> 01:18:36.593
I'll be right back.

01:19:08.792 --> 01:19:11.128
You okay, Mike?

01:19:12.587 --> 01:19:14.881
Yeah, it's cool.

01:19:28.854 --> 01:19:31.732
Is it supposed to look like that?

01:19:33.608 --> 01:19:38.947
Yeah... I guess.

01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:04.514
Go slow.
If you hurt me, the fist.

01:20:12.481 --> 01:20:15.609
- What are you doing?
- What do you think?

01:20:15.817 --> 01:20:20.030
- Not there.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

01:20:30.874 --> 01:20:35.754
- Maybe you should back up a little bit.
- Come on, girl.

01:20:53.271 --> 01:20:54.731
Oh, shit.

01:20:58.985 --> 01:21:02.614
- It broke.
- Get another one.

01:21:02.823 --> 01:21:08.537
We don't need one, do we?
Damn, that was my last one.

01:21:10.163 --> 01:21:15.252
Go to Stacey's room.
He keeps them in his top drawer.

01:21:17.421 --> 01:21:22.801
- I ain't going to his room.
- Do you want to do this or what?

01:21:25.095 --> 01:21:26.430
Damn!

01:21:32.686 --> 01:21:35.522
I can't believe
I've got to do this shit.

01:21:56.376 --> 01:21:58.170
Oh, baby.

01:22:11.099 --> 01:22:12.684
Oh my God, Mike!

01:22:24.029 --> 01:22:27.991
Come on. She said the top drawer.

01:22:54.601 --> 01:22:57.896
Baby, hurry up.

01:23:06.988 --> 01:23:11.910
The things men do for sex.
I was stuck with no way out.

01:23:12.119 --> 01:23:15.247
Stacey was getting lucky while I was
stuck with dirty drawers in my face!

01:23:15.455 --> 01:23:21.420
What happened to your rubbers?
You had four rubbers.

01:23:21.628 --> 01:23:27.551
- I counted. Now one's gone.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

01:23:27.759 --> 01:23:31.805
- What ho are you fucking?
- No ho but you.

01:23:32.014 --> 01:23:37.811
Don't call me no ho.
Shut up and take me home.

01:23:38.020 --> 01:23:42.983
- I was just playing.
- Take me home now!

01:23:51.074 --> 01:23:54.911
- What happened?
- Nothing.

01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:58.331
I got it. It all worked out.

01:24:02.836 --> 01:24:06.923
I guess that means
this was meant to be.

01:24:10.385 --> 01:24:12.429
Yeah, I guess so.

01:24:39.915 --> 01:24:46.672
I'm actually having sex, and with Alicia!
This cannot be real.

01:24:47.839 --> 01:24:50.967
Oh, yeah, this is real.
Real good.

01:24:54.971 --> 01:24:56.973
Oh, shit.

01:25:26.586 --> 01:25:29.214
So that's it?

01:25:30.757 --> 01:25:34.636
Yeah... that's it.

01:25:48.442 --> 01:25:54.322
- So what's gonna happen now?
- I don't know. What?

01:25:59.786 --> 01:26:02.247
What about me and you?

01:26:04.708 --> 01:26:07.169
Me and you sounds good.

01:26:08.754 --> 01:26:11.340
What about homecoming?

01:26:13.592 --> 01:26:16.970
You're just going to have to buy
a new suit.

01:26:18.221 --> 01:26:23.060
So I won the bet.
But I didn't feel right, betting.

01:26:23.268 --> 01:26:29.149
This was Alicia, you know?
She was worth more than money.

01:26:29.358 --> 01:26:34.029
So I didn't tell Slim and Roland
until after one of them won.

01:26:35.947 --> 01:26:39.576
I never in a million years thought -

01:26:40.827 --> 01:26:43.372
- that I would meet Miss Right.

01:26:44.664 --> 01:26:52.464
When I asked Lisa, I kept thinking
of all the things I'd be gaining.

01:26:54.383 --> 01:27:00.180
But I never took the time to think
of all the things I'd be losing.

01:27:00.389 --> 01:27:02.349
We ain't going nowhere.

01:27:03.517 --> 01:27:07.688
Don't give up the best thing you'll
ever get because you're scared.

01:27:12.609 --> 01:27:14.236
You're right, man.

01:27:18.031 --> 01:27:20.283
You're right.

01:27:20.951 --> 01:27:26.498
- So what are you saying?
- I'm ready to marry Lisa.

01:27:26.707 --> 01:27:29.209
Yes, yes, yes!

01:27:31.378 --> 01:27:34.423
Let me ask you something.

01:27:34.631 --> 01:27:38.343
Are you absolutely sure on this?

01:27:39.302 --> 01:27:41.596
Yeah, I just said.

01:27:48.311 --> 01:27:50.188
Yes.

01:27:50.397 --> 01:27:52.649
That's good enough for me.

01:27:55.777 --> 01:28:00.198
- When you see Lisa...
- Where the hell have you all been?

01:28:00.407 --> 01:28:06.955
- Slim had...
- Car trouble? As if we'd buy that!

01:28:07.164 --> 01:28:14.755
- You're a writer. Would you believe it?
- We spent a fortune on this wedding.

01:28:14.963 --> 01:28:19.718
Why are you getting on me?
I'm not the one getting married.

01:28:19.926 --> 01:28:24.514
- Good point.
- If I had to look at him, I'd kill him.

01:28:25.599 --> 01:28:29.519
Come on. And you better stay.

01:28:40.072 --> 01:28:44.493
If he doesn't want to, I'm not
gonna force him. Call it off, then.

01:28:54.127 --> 01:28:59.299
You all must think I'm stupid.
Car broke down?

01:28:59.508 --> 01:29:02.052
He could at least face me like a man!

01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:06.056
I'm not gonna cry. I spent
too much time on this damn make-up!

01:29:06.264 --> 01:29:08.684
- Just stay calm.
- I am calm.

01:29:11.645 --> 01:29:14.648
- Then why are you yelling?
- I'm not!

01:29:14.856 --> 01:29:20.195
I'll get Ro so you can talk to him.

01:29:22.030 --> 01:29:29.746
- No, it's bad luck to see him.
- I thought you wanted to call it off.

01:29:30.872 --> 01:29:37.045
Mike, would I be standing here in this
dress if I didn't want to marry him?

01:29:37.254 --> 01:29:43.301
- But I won't if he has doubts.
- Lisa, it's Daddy.

01:29:43.510 --> 01:29:50.851
- Roland wants to say something.
- Lisa, baby, I'm sorry.

01:29:52.060 --> 01:29:57.482
Lisa, I love you.
I want to marry you.

01:29:57.691 --> 01:30:01.611
- Go away!
- Come on, girl. Please.

01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:11.079
- You need to get out of here.
- I need to see her.

01:30:11.288 --> 01:30:16.585
- She won't see you. It's bad luck.
- So she still wants to get married?

01:30:16.793 --> 01:30:21.340
- I don't know. Let me handle it.
- All right.

01:30:21.548 --> 01:30:24.468
Just give her this.
Give her this.

01:30:27.804 --> 01:30:33.185
- Mike, let me get in there.
- What do you want, man?

01:30:34.603 --> 01:30:38.273
- Hey, man...
- I'll be cool, Mike.

01:30:38.482 --> 01:30:41.234
- Now's not the time.
- I'll be cool.

01:30:42.944 --> 01:30:46.239
- I'll be cool.
- Hook me up.

01:30:50.827 --> 01:30:55.582
- What's up? People are waiting.
- Shut up, Slim.

01:30:56.416 --> 01:31:01.380
- Why?
- You probably told him not to do it.

01:31:01.588 --> 01:31:05.217
You're perfect for each other
because you're both nuts.

01:31:08.136 --> 01:31:13.642
- Nigger, shut up!
- Listen to him. He wants to marry you.

01:31:13.850 --> 01:31:18.313
- Then why did he do this?
- He's scared.

01:31:18.522 --> 01:31:21.358
I've known him 13 years -

01:31:21.566 --> 01:31:27.197
- and I've never heard him talk about
anybody the way he talks about you.

01:31:34.246 --> 01:31:35.997
He wanted me to give that to you.

01:31:38.208 --> 01:31:44.506
- Remember that?
- I didn't know he still had this.

01:31:45.757 --> 01:31:51.388
It was hot that day at the concert.
Roland and Slim drooled over you.

01:31:51.596 --> 01:31:54.516
There wasn't no... I was drooling.

01:31:54.725 --> 01:31:59.021
Slim went over to you
and what did he say?

01:31:59.229 --> 01:32:02.858
- He introduced me to Roland.
- Think about that.

01:32:04.359 --> 01:32:09.865
- That could be Slim out there, crying.
- You all got jokes.

01:32:17.748 --> 01:32:22.002
- I'm glad he's got you guys for friends.
- Give me some sugar, too.

01:32:24.546 --> 01:32:30.302
- Please take him out of his misery.
- Tell him to stop whining.

01:32:30.510 --> 01:32:34.348
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

01:32:59.414 --> 01:33:01.541
Oh, it's on.

01:33:07.089 --> 01:33:09.216
Did you clean it up?

01:33:29.695 --> 01:33:33.615
Hurry up before the Reverend
changes his mind.

01:34:15.949 --> 01:34:23.290
What a joyous occasion
when two come together as one.

01:34:25.292 --> 01:34:29.838
Who amongst us
will give this woman to this man?

01:34:30.047 --> 01:34:31.965
I do.

01:34:37.804 --> 01:34:44.102
You mess up,
I'm going to have to cut you.

01:34:52.277 --> 01:34:54.654
May we have the rings?

01:34:56.698 --> 01:35:02.245
I now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:16.301
I never thought Roland would get
married. I'm glad to see things change.

01:35:22.182 --> 01:35:26.269
- What are you doing?
- You scared me.

01:35:26.478 --> 01:35:32.484
I'm trying to hide from Tanya.
She talks too damn much.

01:35:33.860 --> 01:35:37.698
We better get in before
Alicia beats his ass again.

01:35:40.075 --> 01:35:47.916
- You better run back up in there.
- Tanya's got you cornered, too.

01:35:48.125 --> 01:35:52.462
- "Ro, can I have something to drink?."
- "Okay, Tanya."

01:35:52.671 --> 01:35:57.384
Very funny. You should be
taking notes from Roland.

01:35:57.592 --> 01:36:03.974
- Tonight I'm gonna win the bet.
- Let me explain something to you.

01:36:04.182 --> 01:36:08.687
Tanya ain't giving up shit
and you're still on lock-down.

01:36:08.895 --> 01:36:15.068
- Then why are you here with me?
- We came looking for you.

01:36:15.277 --> 01:36:18.155
- I'm with him.
- Oh, you're with him?

01:36:22.701 --> 01:36:25.495
You got me, man!

01:36:25.704 --> 01:36:30.709
It's not natural to be with one girl.
That just ain't me.

01:36:30.917 --> 01:36:35.630
Right. That's what
I've been trying to tell Mr Faithful.

01:36:35.839 --> 01:36:39.843
What if she's the shit,
like Janet Jackson fine?

01:36:40.052 --> 01:36:45.849
No matter. No woman's
going to put a leash around my neck.

01:36:46.058 --> 01:36:51.605
I can't even button my shirt to the top
without getting nervous.

01:36:51.813 --> 01:36:57.069
- We should play this game for life.
- What game?

01:36:58.737 --> 01:37:03.450
- Macking... Hanging.
- I like that.

01:37:03.658 --> 01:37:09.039
Macking... Hanging.
Macking... Hanging.

01:37:14.419 --> 01:37:19.841
- Ain't that Nichole?
- I'd recognize them legs anywhere.

01:37:20.050 --> 01:37:23.220
Ro, run me a little interference
real quick.

01:37:26.682 --> 01:37:31.978
What did we know? All that mattered
were your boys, the team.

01:37:32.187 --> 01:37:36.233
- We didn't think other things mattered.
- I thought I'd have to dance with Eric.

01:37:37.234 --> 01:37:40.320
- That was funny.
- Where are your boys at?

01:37:42.948 --> 01:37:48.203
- I don't know. Let's go inside.
- Let me fix you up here.

01:37:48.412 --> 01:37:53.375
You hold on to that feeling
until you meet that one.

01:37:53.583 --> 01:37:56.712
It happened to Ro
and it'll happen to Slim.

01:37:57.838 --> 01:38:03.093
Me? I was a goner that first day
she walked into my classroom.

01:38:04.678 --> 01:38:08.473
- May I have this dance, Madame?
- Yes, you may.

01:38:13.895 --> 01:38:20.736
- How is life in the Big Apple?
- Cold.

01:38:20.944 --> 01:38:26.867
- I still haven't got used to it.
- Finally made it back to Inglewood?

01:38:28.285 --> 01:38:31.705
The wedding gave me a good reason
to come back and see an old friend.

01:38:33.790 --> 01:38:38.962
- I haven't seen Roland in years.
- You came all the way to see him?

01:38:39.171 --> 01:38:42.716
- And Slim, too.
- And Slim?

01:38:46.178 --> 01:38:48.638
But you're dancing with me.

01:39:05.906 --> 01:39:08.200
So, how cold is it back east?

01:39:57.457 --> 01:39:59.835
Let's start this off.

01:40:03.714 --> 01:40:11.555
You got the good sound.
This is the best man's toast. Get up.

01:40:11.763 --> 01:40:15.225
Before we get started,
I have some bad news.

01:40:15.434 --> 01:40:21.398
Reverend Parker was arrested
for impersonating a minister.

01:40:22.816 --> 01:40:26.862
So we have to do this again next week.

01:40:27.070 --> 01:40:32.993
I love you guys
and I'm going to turn this over to Mike.

01:40:38.290 --> 01:40:44.463
I guess since we are the best men
we ought to say something.

01:40:46.256 --> 01:40:51.511
We all did a lot of things
to get prepared for today.

01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:54.431
I did a lot of thinking.

01:40:56.641 --> 01:40:59.936
And I came to a funny conclusion.

01:41:01.021 --> 01:41:03.357
I realized how selfish I was.

01:41:04.191 --> 01:41:09.488
Because I felt like
I was losing a very dear friend.

01:41:09.696 --> 01:41:14.534
That may not sound
like the right thing to say.

01:41:14.743 --> 01:41:19.498
But I moved around a lot as a boy
and never knew what it was like -

01:41:19.706 --> 01:41:27.706
- to have real true friends,
until I met Roland and Levinio.

01:41:28.048 --> 01:41:30.801
You need to stop.

01:41:31.009 --> 01:41:37.683
So today I'm a bit upset,
but I'm also very happy -

01:41:37.891 --> 01:41:42.229
- and extremely proud of you, man.

01:41:42.437 --> 01:41:46.233
I'd like to ask God
to bless Roland and Lisa -

01:41:46.441 --> 01:41:51.738
- as they enter a beautiful
new life together.

01:41:51.947 --> 01:41:56.243
If he gets out of control,
Slim got a headlock for him.

01:41:56.451 --> 01:41:59.121
And we ain't laughing.

01:41:59.329 --> 01:42:04.292
To our parents, you know we love
you all and thanks for all the love.

01:42:06.128 --> 01:42:11.258
And to the two grown men
who mean the most to me, -

01:42:12.968 --> 01:42:17.055
- I'll never forget the times we had -

01:42:17.264 --> 01:42:22.060
- and I look forward to the future,
and I love you all.

01:42:22.269 --> 01:42:25.063
You're my brothers.

01:42:27.024 --> 01:42:32.195
So, let's do this one for the Wood.

01:42:32.404 --> 01:42:35.323
- To where it all started.
- The Wood!
