Hi. (SIGHS) I'm Abby Parker.

22:16.917 --> 22:18.083
For almost 15 years,

22:18.166 --> 22:20.249
I've run a bar
over on 45th Street.

22:20.333 --> 22:23.917
Anyone who comes into my bar,
they're my customer.

22:26.083 --> 22:28.583
In this neighborhood,
that's meant getting to know

22:28.667 --> 22:31.792
more than a few prostitutes,
pimps,

22:31.875 --> 22:35.291
dealers, addicts,
homeless people...

22:35.375 --> 22:37.500
All the undesirables
you allude to

22:37.583 --> 22:39.208

22:39.291 --> 22:42.667
Those are my customers,
and many have become friends.

22:42.750 --> 22:45.249
And, Gene, you're misleading
everyone coming here

22:45.333 --> 22:47.792
to tell us that this new phase
of redevelopment

22:47.875 --> 22:50.541

from itself,

22:50.625 --> 22:53.249
that the city is looking
out for us.

22:53.333 --> 22:54.583
Sure.

22:54.667 --> 22:57.041
There's billions of dollars
at play...

22:57.124 --> 22:58.792
but it's private money.

23:00.166 --> 23:01.291
Seems your role in this

23:01.375 --> 23:03.124
is to make the remapping
of Times Square

23:03.208 --> 23:04.375
a bit more palatable

23:04.458 --> 23:07.166
by pretending
it's a public project.

But, Gene, you know I mean this
with love in my heart.

development and jobs coming in,

23:29.875 --> 23:32.166
but the people I know
won't see any of that.

23:32.249 --> 23:35.541
No. You're gonna rebuild
and re-gild Times Square,

to corporate standards

gets kicked down the road.

what happened to him.

25:24.708 --> 25:26.500

25:43.416 --> 25:47.291
But I know it may have happened
because when push came to shove,

25:47.375 --> 25:48.625
he didn't give you up.

25:49.625 --> 25:50.750
Did you know that?

25:52.041 --> 25:55.333
He took your weight
for killing Cacace.

25:55.416 --> 25:56.833
He paid your debt that way.

25:57.750 --> 25:59.208
So, now Cacace's people,

25:59.291 --> 26:00.708
they're not looking for you
anymore

26:00.792 --> 26:02.458

an eye for an eye.

you and Frankie.

About the drug thing.

26:13.958 --> 26:15.792
I thought he might've been
in that.

26:16.458 --> 26:18.166
No shit.

26:18.249 --> 26:20.083
These past weeks,
you've been duckin' me

if you so much as

26:22.291 --> 26:23.583
blink in front of me.

26:25.416 --> 26:28.875

running out of the hotel bars,

32:59.500 --> 33:01.458

33:01.541 --> 33:03.958
there was this one guy who
went by "Spanish Joe"

33:04.041 --> 33:06.750
who marked me
as soon as I came in.

33:06.833 --> 33:10.249
I don't know why, certain guys
just be angry like that.

33:10.333 --> 33:12.333

33:12.416 --> 33:16.208

"I'm about to murder yo' ass."

That was his big mistake.

too long. Like my man Tuco said,

"When you have to shoot, shoot,
don't talk."

33:26.166 --> 33:27.750
Spanish Joe
gave me time to think,

33:27.833 --> 33:30.500
so I made a decision.
Got friendly with the guard,

33:30.583 --> 33:32.999
he passed me one of those
machinist screwdrivers

33:33.083 --> 33:34.667
with the long shaft.

33:34.750 --> 33:37.708

Spanish Joe in the showers.

most vulnerable?

33:39.875 --> 33:41.416

33:42.249 --> 33:43.583
Got him in a headlock

33:43.667 --> 33:45.999
and drove that screwdriver
through his eye,

33:46.083 --> 33:48.166
all the way to the handle.

33:48.249 --> 33:50.833
Just buried the motherfucker
in his brain.

33:50.917 --> 33:54.750
See, he thought it was gonna go
a certain way,

33:54.833 --> 33:57.458
but it was me who wrote
the end of his story.

33:57.541 --> 33:59.917
I'm confused.
You're saying what?

33:59.999 --> 34:01.792
That we should kill Xiomara?

34:01.875 --> 34:03.500
You're missing my point
entirely.

34:03.583 --> 34:05.416
I had a problem and I solved it.

34:07.124 --> 34:11.083
Let me ask again. What am I
supposed to tell Tommy Longo?

34:11.166 --> 34:13.333

fight the future.

34:13.416 --> 34:14.708

34:14.792 --> 34:16.208
Look that dago motherfucker
in the eye

34:16.291 --> 34:17.958
and tell him we
gotta do something else.

No idea.

1:01:44.792 --> 1:01:47.083
CHRIS BAUER:
The message business
is running real dry

1:01:47.291 --> 1:01:49.750
for a couple reasons.
The biggest one is beepers.

1:01:49.917 --> 1:01:51.833
Once the girls found out
there was this thing

1:01:51.958 --> 1:01:53.416
that they could have
for ten bucks a month,

1:01:53.500 --> 1:01:56.083
or whatever it was,
they can work for themselves.

1:01:56.333 --> 1:01:59.667
I have a question,
what do you do?

1:02:00.041 --> 1:02:02.166
People were using
the massage parlors less

1:02:02.249 --> 1:02:03.249
because of the AIDS fear.

1:02:03.458 --> 1:02:05.500
The hotels make it a little bit,
on the surface,

1:02:05.583 --> 1:02:08.291
a little bit safer, cleaner,
etc.

DWYER: The game's changed.
Three girls will pool money

1:02:22.958 --> 1:02:25.083
and get a furnished apartment
over near one of the tunnels,

1:02:25.375 --> 1:02:28.083
put an ad in the Voice,
and boom, instant trick pad.

1:02:28.166 --> 1:02:30.166
We're not getting a piece
of any of that stuff?

1:02:30.416 --> 1:02:33.416
All of the array
of infrastructure

1:02:33.500 --> 1:02:35.083
required to get you laid,

1:02:35.166 --> 1:02:37.750
all of the middlemen,
all of the places where

1:02:37.833 --> 1:02:39.958
people could lay in the cut
and take some of the money,

1:02:40.166 --> 1:02:42.291
places for the mob to live,
it's all ruined

1:02:42.375 --> 1:02:44.833
when it's some woman
with her own phone number,

1:02:44.917 --> 1:02:46.917
and an ad in the back
of the Village Voice.

1:02:46.999 --> 1:02:49.083
DWYER: Beepers made 'em bold.
They figured out,

1:02:49.166 --> 1:02:51.083
they don't need pimps
or whorehouses.

1:02:51.166 --> 1:02:53.416

They're right.

1:02:54.541 --> 1:02:55.875
It's an economics problem.

1:02:55.958 --> 1:02:57.667
And there's nothing they can do
to stop 'em.

1:02:59.166 --> 1:03:01.249
ALEX HALL:
I think the biggest challenge

1:03:01.333 --> 1:03:02.458
that we had in this episode

1:03:02.667 --> 1:03:06.291
was depicting the end
of Lori's story.

1:03:06.500 --> 1:03:10.166
I left my man, and me
and Kiki split up too. So...

1:03:10.375 --> 1:03:12.124
The key to Lori's character
is a line,

1:03:12.208 --> 1:03:13.792
and you gotta go back
to the first season.

1:03:13.999 --> 1:03:16.708
Me, I need pimpin',
otherwise I tend to get lazy.

1:03:17.708 --> 1:03:19.958
She desperately wants someone
to come and save her

1:03:20.041 --> 1:03:21.208
and that just keeps
not happening.

1:03:21.375 --> 1:03:25.541
I don't have a man anymore.
I don't have a family.

1:03:25.708 --> 1:03:27.083
HALL: And in that moment,
Lori realizes

1:03:27.166 --> 1:03:28.999
that she doesn't have anything

1:03:29.083 --> 1:03:31.875
other than
her porn star persona.

1:03:31.958 --> 1:03:32.875
This is all I am.

1:03:32.958 --> 1:03:36.458
And she doesn't know
how to go on.

1:03:36.958 --> 1:03:38.792
EMILY MEADE:
There was a big debate,
in leading up to this

1:03:38.875 --> 1:03:40.833
of like, when does she decide
to kill herself?

1:03:40.917 --> 1:03:42.458
And, what is the trigger?

1:03:42.541 --> 1:03:43.500
Hey, baby.

1:03:43.917 --> 1:03:47.875
And so, for me, I feel like,
Lori's sort of always

1:03:47.958 --> 1:03:49.625
had that in the back
of her mind,

1:03:49.708 --> 1:03:51.291
at least for a long time.

1:03:51.375 --> 1:03:53.708
And I think the choices
she's made have always

1:03:53.792 --> 1:03:57.291
had a lack of respect
for her life underneath it.

1:03:57.375 --> 1:03:58.375
What's your real name?

1:03:59.166 --> 1:04:00.166
Land O' Lakes girl.

1:04:00.249 --> 1:04:01.333
MAGGIE GYLLENHAAL:
It's complicated.

1:04:01.416 --> 1:04:03.208
I mean, Lori comes to her
at the end

1:04:03.291 --> 1:04:04.583
and is in terrible shape.

1:04:04.667 --> 1:04:07.249
And, Candy doesn't say,
"You know what?

1:04:07.917 --> 1:04:09.124
Spend the night on my sofa.

1:04:09.208 --> 1:04:10.833
The last thing you need to be
doing right now

1:04:10.917 --> 1:04:12.583
is fucking on film."

1:04:12.792 --> 1:04:14.583
We really wanted the audience
to have to,

1:04:14.667 --> 1:04:18.041
sort of examine their own role
in all of this.

1:04:18.249 --> 1:04:21.416
I think in that moment of Lori
deciding to kill herself,

1:04:21.500 --> 1:04:23.166
we didn't want to let
anybody off the hook,

1:04:23.249 --> 1:04:25.458
ourselves or the audience.
