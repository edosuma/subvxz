01:33.519 --> 01:35.399
<i>Every day I know this is what
I was born to do.</i>

01:35.561 --> 01:38.592
It's everything to me.
And nothing else matters except...

01:39.501 --> 01:40.680
This is for you, Mum...

01:43.760 --> 01:47.676
Singing "Juicing Down",
please welcome Karen McLair!

03:02.358 --> 03:04.746
<i>Let's see what the judges think...</i>

03:04.866 --> 03:07.181
<i>Ladies, could you be happy
with Karen in the Sexxbombz?</i>

03:07.301 --> 03:09.847
<i>Yeah.
It'd be lovely. I love her.</i>

03:12.221 --> 03:14.452
Jordan, did you get Karen tonight?

03:14.572 --> 03:17.399
Karen. I'm going to be honest
with you, okay?

03:18.333 --> 03:20.440
We're in the semi-finals
of this competition.

03:21.048 --> 03:23.091
<i>Everybody's talented. Yeah?</i>

03:23.823 --> 03:25.302
<i>But the question is...</i>

03:25.826 --> 03:27.742
<i>Are you talented enough</i>

03:28.036 --> 03:29.869
<i>to join the Sexxbombz?</i>

03:29.989 --> 03:32.463
- How can you watch this again?
- Shut up, cockhead...

03:32.583 --> 03:35.304
<i>You know what?
You dance like a gazelle.</i>

03:35.755 --> 03:37.198
<i>On acid.</i>

03:37.458 --> 03:38.544
<i>I love it!</i>

03:38.830 --> 03:40.263
<i>I love it! Yes!</i>

03:42.215 --> 03:43.431
Do you think I look hot?

03:43.551 --> 03:45.371
Don't be fucking twisted.
You're my sister.

03:45.491 --> 03:46.491
Dad!

03:49.924 --> 03:52.920
- Freddie says I look ugly.
- She doesn't look ugly. She looks sexy.

03:53.080 --> 03:54.827
I didn't say that.
She's talking bollocks.

03:54.947 --> 03:57.167
Tell your sister she looks
sexy on the television.

03:59.051 --> 04:00.051
Go on...

04:01.176 --> 04:03.176
You look sexy on telly, Karen.

04:03.788 --> 04:05.788
Now. Let's watch the good bit.

04:06.267 --> 04:07.921
<i>We've had a record number of votes,</i>

04:08.041 --> 04:10.827
<i>over 1,000 texts and phone calls.</i>

04:10.947 --> 04:13.511
<i>And the last girl
to go through to the final</i>

04:13.983 --> 04:16.439
<i>of "Search for a Sexxbomb" is...</i>

04:19.680 --> 04:21.120
You know you bloody won!

04:31.133 --> 04:33.458
<i>I just hope my mum
was watching up in Heaven.</i>

04:33.860 --> 04:36.144
<i>This is for you, Mum,
and I love you forever!</i>

04:37.714 --> 04:40.121
For fuck's sake, Dad.
Listen to what she's saying.

05:02.673 --> 05:03.920
You're in my garden.

05:05.422 --> 05:06.422
Right.

05:12.044 --> 05:12.974
I...

05:14.170 --> 05:16.320
- wanted to see what was in your shed.
- My...?

05:16.900 --> 05:17.858
Shed.

05:20.081 --> 05:22.112
Everyone says
you have a marvellous shed.

05:22.232 --> 05:23.635
- Everyone?
- Yeah.

05:25.279 --> 05:26.679
It's marvelled at.

05:34.827 --> 05:35.990
So, this is it.

05:45.325 --> 05:47.639
So what do you and the boys
do in here?

05:47.801 --> 05:50.409
Braid each other's hair
and play soggy biscuit?

05:51.482 --> 05:53.083
No... not for ages.

05:58.050 --> 05:59.130
Spliff, then?

06:00.066 --> 06:01.066
Cool.

06:09.277 --> 06:11.760
Why don't you get your porn
on the internet, like normal people?

06:20.679 --> 06:22.099
What the fuck's this?

06:23.806 --> 06:26.448
You know, sometimes, when we're...

06:26.920 --> 06:28.409
we're too stoned to...

06:29.139 --> 06:30.220
go outside...

06:33.635 --> 06:34.635
I'm sorry.

06:36.641 --> 06:39.058
- I wasn't really expecting guests.
- What do you normally do?

06:39.178 --> 06:40.393
Put out doilies?

06:41.852 --> 06:44.052
Well, they do keep the cups clean.

06:59.171 --> 07:00.662
Thanks for letting me in.

07:00.972 --> 07:02.000
I know it's weird.

07:04.640 --> 07:06.079
It's... whatever. You know.

07:11.102 --> 07:12.102
It's cool.

07:15.161 --> 07:16.161
It's cool.

07:18.915 --> 07:21.480
It's just...
Seems like a good place to hide.

07:25.527 --> 07:27.151
You'll never guess
what just happened.

07:27.271 --> 07:29.280
This skinny Asian fucker
was at the Green,

07:30.480 --> 07:31.840
body popping on a bit of lino.

07:35.200 --> 07:37.496
He's got a little sign saying
"Anwar the Magnificent", right?

07:37.616 --> 07:40.720
He's busking, making cash money.
So I said to him if I can join in...

07:41.320 --> 07:43.866
And he says do I know the Buddha
Buddha Cheese Buddha routine.

07:43.986 --> 07:45.019
So I says...

07:48.198 --> 07:50.800
Well, blow bubbles up
my bollocks and call me Shirley.

07:58.516 --> 08:00.970
Welcome to our fortress of solitude!

08:06.187 --> 08:08.137
I think I love the Sexxbombz.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.430
Karen's costume last night
was a bit of a marvel.

08:11.797 --> 08:14.120
I'm pretty sure it defied
the laws of physics. I mean,

08:14.280 --> 08:16.512
that tiny amount of material
is surely not be able to cover

08:16.632 --> 08:18.679
the requisite surface area
for UK broadcasting laws.

08:19.613 --> 08:21.505
- Did you see it, Eff?
- No...

08:22.439 --> 08:25.057
That skirt was so short
I saw her bumhole wink.

08:31.144 --> 08:32.801
Pass the spliff, Freddiebrek.

08:34.820 --> 08:36.522
Don't worry, I've perfected it.

08:45.160 --> 08:46.884
Water... water...

08:48.242 --> 08:49.242
No way...

08:57.348 --> 08:58.800
Fucking Genius!

08:58.960 --> 09:00.757
How long have you
had that planted there?

09:00.877 --> 09:01.960
About eight months.

09:03.236 --> 09:04.320
Fucking genius.

09:05.037 --> 09:06.520
Fucking top, mate.

09:07.040 --> 09:08.837
That's fucking tip toparoo.

09:09.480 --> 09:11.440
After all this excitement,
I fancy a spunk.

09:11.625 --> 09:13.319
You coming, Eff? You soon will be.

09:16.059 --> 09:17.400
I'd sooner fuck JJ.

09:19.640 --> 09:22.960
That isn't intended as a compliment.
But I'm going to take it as one anyway.

09:23.121 --> 09:26.069
Maybe you didn't get it.
"Are you coming, Eff? You soon will be."

09:26.189 --> 09:27.189
I got it.

09:27.689 --> 09:29.158
Freddie and JJ got it.

09:29.880 --> 09:31.747
That termite over there got it.

09:32.167 --> 09:34.720
But you're not going to get it.
Got it?

09:35.491 --> 09:36.760
No... I'm confused.

09:39.270 --> 09:41.440
I'm not going anywhere
near your crayola dick.

09:43.003 --> 09:44.353
I know where it's been.

09:44.473 --> 09:46.280
- What's she talking about?
- Piss off then.

09:47.687 --> 09:50.099
This is our place, right?
If you're not going to shag us,

09:50.219 --> 09:51.280
then get to fuck.

10:04.439 --> 10:06.719
Mate, try and stir my porridge
if you want

10:08.440 --> 10:10.913
but I'd say even Jay's got
a better chance than you.

10:11.033 --> 10:13.935
I mean, when was the last time
you breathed fire?

10:41.809 --> 10:43.059
Dinner's ready!

10:56.160 --> 10:59.624
<i>So, should I be called Minxy
Sexxbomb or Foxy Sexxbomb?</i>

10:59.898 --> 11:03.468
<i>Jordan says he likes Minxy.
I wanted it to be Sexy Sexxbomb...</i>

11:14.221 --> 11:17.480
Can't you tell? Look at his eyes.
He's completely monged.

11:20.840 --> 11:21.840
I'm not.

11:26.339 --> 11:27.339
I've...

11:27.839 --> 11:29.080
got coursework now.

11:29.701 --> 11:31.281
You gonna tell him?
About the thing?

11:31.401 --> 11:32.451
Sit down!

11:32.571 --> 11:33.671
I'm busy....

11:33.838 --> 11:35.678
Freddie, sit down!

11:38.905 --> 11:39.974
Sit down.

11:46.374 --> 11:49.218
- We want you here at two tomorrow.
- What for?

11:49.338 --> 11:51.843
Filming for the interview
before my final performance.

11:51.963 --> 11:53.812
You've got to talk about
how much you miss Mum

11:53.932 --> 11:55.950
and how much it'll mean to you
to see me win.

11:59.399 --> 12:01.470
This is like,
too fucked-up for words.

12:01.681 --> 12:04.922
- My Mum's dead, vote for me...
- It's not like it's not true.

12:05.223 --> 12:08.342
- I miss Mum every day.
- Shit... Dad, she's doing it again!

12:08.462 --> 12:10.430
You need a story,
everyone knows that.

12:10.550 --> 12:12.719
- See!
- She didn't mean it like that.

12:12.839 --> 12:15.578
Yes, I did. At least I've got
some fucking ambition!

12:15.698 --> 12:17.826
I don't really think wanting
Robbie Williams

12:17.946 --> 12:20.065
to jizz over your baps
doesn't count as ambition!

12:20.185 --> 12:22.030
That's nice. That's lovely guys.

12:22.150 --> 12:25.091
- Be here tomorrow at two o'clock.
- You know what? Why should I?

12:25.321 --> 12:28.966
Cos I wash your clothes, cook
your meals, put a roof over your head,

12:29.086 --> 12:30.594
probably pay for your skunk

12:30.714 --> 12:33.714
and I do it all without asking
anything in return. Except this.

12:33.834 --> 12:35.153
Look! Look at her!

12:35.273 --> 12:37.390
She's your sister,
you support her. That's it.

12:37.812 --> 12:38.912
It's just...

12:39.648 --> 12:41.020
Fucking hell...

12:42.627 --> 12:43.627
You know?

12:44.974 --> 12:48.298
It's just, like...
Fucking hell, you know?

12:56.670 --> 12:59.144
- Dad!
- Get back here and apologise.

13:00.701 --> 13:02.017
Freddie, get back here!

13:02.137 --> 13:04.276
Dad, get him back here now
and make him apologise to me!

13:04.396 --> 13:05.220
Sorry.

13:05.553 --> 13:08.464
Dad, you've got to get him
back here. Dad, please...

13:43.661 --> 13:46.262
Hamlet. What's it all about...

13:47.149 --> 13:48.149
dudes?

13:50.396 --> 13:51.396
Anyone?

13:54.171 --> 13:55.484
Well, Josie,

13:57.135 --> 13:59.025
through the fog of his grief,

13:59.548 --> 14:01.631
Hamlet is struggling to choose

14:01.841 --> 14:04.658
between action or inaction,

14:04.778 --> 14:06.949
and through this struggle,

14:07.178 --> 14:10.927
he encounters existential forces,

14:11.047 --> 14:14.551
illuminating the path
towards death which is,

14:14.966 --> 14:17.266
in itself, life.

14:18.484 --> 14:22.246
My my, that is
an illuminating thesis, Gerald.

14:22.555 --> 14:24.071
Well, done.
Thank you.

14:24.281 --> 14:26.593
No, thank you.
You're a delight to teach.

14:31.409 --> 14:34.159
- I got held up.
- Freddie's always late.

14:35.041 --> 14:35.991
Sorry...

14:36.656 --> 14:37.751
Sit down, please.

14:40.001 --> 14:42.365
Is Freddie gonna fail his A-levels?

14:42.594 --> 14:44.098
Fraid so, Gerald.

14:44.761 --> 14:47.791
You're all gonna fail if you
don't read the pucking book...

14:48.001 --> 14:49.740
I've read it! It was great!

14:50.904 --> 14:52.828
I didn't really
understand it though.

14:53.906 --> 14:56.611
Did the ghost do it after all,
or was it Voldemort?

14:56.731 --> 14:58.631
He's a right beast, in't he?

14:58.841 --> 15:01.391
I think you got your books
mixed up again, Panda.

15:02.792 --> 15:04.371
So! In summary,

15:05.227 --> 15:09.227
the predominant themes
of William Shakespeare's Hamlet are...

15:10.410 --> 15:12.471
action, inaction, madness,

15:13.623 --> 15:14.623
madness,

15:15.826 --> 15:16.826
grief,

15:17.504 --> 15:18.504
death...

15:31.524 --> 15:34.065
Being, or not being.

15:34.726 --> 15:36.517
That is the question...

15:59.854 --> 16:00.954
Anyone else?

16:02.389 --> 16:04.311
Hamlet's basically a teenage boy.

16:04.642 --> 16:06.357
He's got these desires

16:06.477 --> 16:08.733
but he doesn't have the bottle
to reach for them.

16:08.853 --> 16:12.023
So he goes mad
and wanks off about Ophelia

16:12.143 --> 16:15.070
and ends up so boring
that somebody has to kill him.

16:15.654 --> 16:17.071
I'm not sure that's right.

16:17.388 --> 16:19.419
There's no wanking in Hamlet.

16:20.282 --> 16:23.471
There is. Loads.
Only they call it "soliloquizing".

16:26.561 --> 16:27.854
Nice one, blondie.

16:28.762 --> 16:29.862
She's funny.

16:32.365 --> 16:33.515
Please don't!

16:35.289 --> 16:36.979
Stop it... Stop it, please!

16:38.077 --> 16:41.477
Thanks a lot, Cook.
Now my nipples are really chafed.

16:42.098 --> 16:44.267
Come on.
We're going down the boozer.

16:44.851 --> 16:46.724
- I'm gonna...
- Come on! I need to get

16:46.844 --> 16:49.511
that fucking Dickens out me head.
Let's get fucking trashed!

16:49.936 --> 16:52.527
- But...
- Come on, Freds. It's been...

16:53.073 --> 16:55.591
ages since we last went out.

16:59.189 --> 17:00.372
I'm going home.

17:11.127 --> 17:12.675
Please don't! Not again!

17:14.550 --> 17:15.790
Have a tickle!

17:24.819 --> 17:25.819
So...

17:27.676 --> 17:30.931
Tell us what it means to you
to have Karen

17:31.164 --> 17:35.051
in the grand final
of Search For A Sexxbomb?

17:40.377 --> 17:42.827
It's like, you know...
well, I mean...

17:44.104 --> 17:46.204
I can't quite put it into words.

17:48.644 --> 17:49.511
It's great.

17:50.471 --> 17:51.931
It is great.

17:52.361 --> 17:54.188
He is just the best brother
in the world.

17:55.048 --> 17:57.789
We take every day
as a blessing from God, because,

17:58.140 --> 18:00.260
you know,
Mum isn't with us any more.

18:00.380 --> 18:02.027
It really makes you think.

18:02.494 --> 18:03.494
Does it?

18:04.175 --> 18:05.225
About what?

18:05.822 --> 18:08.069
About, you know...
Life is precious

18:08.508 --> 18:09.508
and stuff.

18:10.999 --> 18:13.396
Why don't you tell me
what it was like

18:13.800 --> 18:16.671
- to lose your mother?
- I didn't lose her.

18:17.069 --> 18:19.391
I'm not gonna find her
down the back of the sofa or anything.

18:19.801 --> 18:21.238
But, you know, like,

18:21.840 --> 18:24.471
- how did it feel?
- It felt great.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.735
It felt really great.

18:28.739 --> 18:31.849
Let me ask you... How does it
feel being a cocaine-snorting,

18:31.969 --> 18:33.671
in low-budget, corporate puppet?

18:37.320 --> 18:39.871
- I think we're going to cut here.
- Mum was...

18:40.919 --> 18:44.043
She was the one who told me
that I had a talent, a gift.

18:44.409 --> 18:46.511
Who first sang with me
and believed in me.

18:47.734 --> 18:50.118
When I'm singing out there,
I'm not just singing for me.

18:51.233 --> 18:52.650
I'm singing for her.

18:53.768 --> 18:56.951
And I'm singing for anyone
who's ever been through tragedy.

19:00.732 --> 19:04.391
Cut there. I love you, Karen!
I actually love you.

19:07.114 --> 19:09.591
You're so warm and sweet and cool.

19:09.801 --> 19:12.645
I could eat you.
I'd love to eat you.

19:13.218 --> 19:16.236
- You'd like that, wouldn't you, Karen?
- I'd love that, Jordan.

19:16.356 --> 19:17.751
OK, all right...

19:18.184 --> 19:20.750
Listen, I need a chai latte.
Where's that asshole runner?

19:20.870 --> 19:22.900
In there, with the other arseholes.

19:25.178 --> 19:27.203
You know, you're not that hot kid.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.190
Nobody wants to eat you...

19:29.401 --> 19:31.471
- Phil, yes, my man...
- You're such a cock.

19:31.964 --> 19:33.701
Why are you trying
to fuck this up for me?

19:33.821 --> 19:36.711
I want the stuff
that makes me go gaga, you know?

19:36.921 --> 19:39.647
Start raping people, you know?
You are beautiful.

19:39.767 --> 19:40.884
I'll see you then.

19:42.517 --> 19:45.431
You know. You oughta get laid
or something, kid.

19:46.348 --> 19:49.099
I might be a corporate puppet
or whatever

19:50.031 --> 19:51.984
but I have a fucking good time.

19:52.588 --> 19:55.680
How's being an angsty little prick
working out for you?

20:12.276 --> 20:14.282
I haven't seen
you dressed like that since...

20:15.449 --> 20:16.449
ever.

20:18.927 --> 20:21.791
You look a bit
like Frau Hilde from Primary.

20:22.503 --> 20:25.658
Right now Kinder,
get ze glitter on ze macaroni und stick!

20:25.778 --> 20:27.591
Stick! Express yourselves, ja?

20:33.441 --> 20:35.590
Ze glue is all over das lippen.

20:44.113 --> 20:47.760
Do you remember how Cook used to try
and ping his crayons into her bra?

21:03.349 --> 21:04.591
Primary was fun.

21:07.880 --> 21:09.030
Yeah, it was.

21:11.027 --> 21:14.332
Cook wants you to come
to Uncle Keith's pub quiz tomorrow.

21:14.838 --> 21:17.591
If Cook wants me there, I suppose
I'd better fucking hop to it at 9!

21:20.494 --> 21:23.031
Freddie... Why don't you want
to be friends with us any more?

21:23.151 --> 21:24.891
Cook hasn't got any friends.

21:25.312 --> 21:27.311
Just... people that he knows.

21:27.973 --> 21:29.572
Don't say that.

21:34.215 --> 21:36.018
So? I mean...

21:36.520 --> 21:38.070
What else are you gonna do?

21:45.023 --> 21:46.023
Anyway...

21:46.710 --> 21:49.195
- You'll like this.
- Hang on, pack of cards...

21:50.444 --> 21:52.714
handkerchief, and a mouse,

21:52.834 --> 21:55.964
but I haven't actually
got a mouse, so...

21:56.084 --> 21:59.081
so, a rubber.
I need you to pick a card...

22:00.343 --> 22:01.804
I'll pick it for you.

22:19.813 --> 22:21.263
I hope you're okay.

22:21.753 --> 22:22.471
Good.

22:22.985 --> 22:25.566
Now, Elizabeth. It's important
for you to remember

22:25.686 --> 22:28.670
that your mother
and I still love each other very much.

22:29.184 --> 22:31.504
- No we don't.
- That's right. We don't.

22:31.721 --> 22:33.874
- That's why you're leaving.
- That's why I'm leaving.

22:33.994 --> 22:36.368
That's why I'm fucking
out of here, woman.

22:36.732 --> 22:38.685
I am on a fucking plane.

22:38.805 --> 22:41.161
You're dead right.
I am fucking out of here...

22:52.997 --> 22:54.042
What's up?

23:04.507 --> 23:07.568
And you've got
so little imagination,

23:07.935 --> 23:09.939
you have to shag my fucking boss!

23:10.681 --> 23:14.359
It's pathetic. You could have shagged
the turd from Tesco's.

23:14.479 --> 23:16.376
- Take anything!
- I don't want anything!

23:16.496 --> 23:19.313
Take it! Otherwise
it's all gonna cunting Oxfam!

23:19.433 --> 23:22.873
Don't you dare use "cunt"
and "Oxfam" in the same sentence!

23:22.993 --> 23:27.460
- Take something. You bought it...
- All right. I'll take my fucking pan.

23:27.580 --> 23:30.191
Take that pan
and you are fucking dead!

23:30.361 --> 23:32.001
I brought your bracelet back.

23:32.121 --> 23:33.121
Thanks.

23:39.041 --> 23:40.190
We'd be good together.

23:43.477 --> 23:45.129
- Don't you think?
- No.

23:47.195 --> 23:49.596
- Why?
- Because I'll break your heart.

23:52.322 --> 23:53.986
Maybe I'll break yours.

23:54.919 --> 23:56.669
Nobody breaks my heart...

23:57.321 --> 23:59.784
and anyway, why would I want that?

24:04.258 --> 24:05.991
Who the buggering tits is this?

24:08.946 --> 24:10.096
Unbelievable.

24:17.381 --> 24:19.576
They're not actually crazy,
you know.

24:20.517 --> 24:21.967
They're just women.

26:03.399 --> 26:05.960
It's amazing what you can
accomplish if you get up early.

26:07.805 --> 26:08.532
Fuck!

26:08.657 --> 26:11.790
- Don't swear. I don't like swearing.
- This is bullshit!

26:11.915 --> 26:13.668
This is our fucking shed.

26:14.325 --> 26:16.078
Mine and JJ's and Cook's.

26:16.595 --> 26:19.988
- Since we were little kids.
- Maybe it's time you grew up then.

26:20.113 --> 26:23.840
Besides, Karen needs somewhere
to rehearse, and actually it's my shed.

26:26.090 --> 26:28.530
I think this is the worst thing
anyone's ever done to me.

26:28.650 --> 26:30.880
I didn't do to you.
I did it for you.

26:53.868 --> 26:54.668
Right.

26:54.827 --> 26:56.104
Question 23...

26:57.955 --> 27:00.629
A swan is
the only bird with a penis,

27:01.666 --> 27:04.232
but how long can a cockroach live

27:04.636 --> 27:07.396
- after you've pulled its head off?
- Easy.

27:09.872 --> 27:13.876
This is the life. The three musketeers
out on the lash. Let's have a cheers.

27:14.522 --> 27:18.476
The only man in Britain to survive
three attempts to hang him

27:19.409 --> 27:22.403
was John Babbacombe Lee
at Exeter Jail.

27:22.899 --> 27:25.779
On what dates were
the attempts made?

27:25.904 --> 27:28.236
Keith, what's up
with these questions?

27:30.339 --> 27:31.760
Do you wanna be disqualified?

27:34.178 --> 27:35.678
What were the dates?

27:41.218 --> 27:43.876
Do you know what
Naomi is spelled backwards?

27:45.557 --> 27:47.480
- I moan...
- Fucking JJ...

27:52.043 --> 27:53.225
Brilliant, man.

27:53.417 --> 27:56.912
In Sherwood Forest, a famous...

27:57.062 --> 27:58.852
- What's up?
- You all right?

27:58.977 --> 28:00.578
Yes, fine. Who's this?

28:02.449 --> 28:03.449
What is it?

28:03.845 --> 28:04.572
Mike.

28:06.091 --> 28:07.920
- Romantic...
- All right, love.

28:08.601 --> 28:11.124
Clitoris Allsorts could do
with some more members.

28:11.612 --> 28:13.160
All right Keith, we're not stopping.

28:15.005 --> 28:16.047
Right...

28:16.308 --> 28:17.443
Next question.

28:18.164 --> 28:22.215
When dropped from a height of
100 inches onto concrete,

28:22.570 --> 28:26.184
how high should
a new tennis ball bounce?

28:27.473 --> 28:29.771
Answers in hectares please.

28:33.852 --> 28:36.718
- I've got the answer.
- Write it down then J-kins.

28:41.719 --> 28:43.840
We don't let nothing
come between us. Yeah?

28:45.004 --> 28:47.502
Bros before hos, boys.
Bros before hos.

28:48.308 --> 28:49.058
Anyway.

28:49.183 --> 28:52.428
We've got bigger fish to fuck. Who does
your sister think she is? Gina G?

28:52.553 --> 28:54.240
This fucking shed situation
is fucked.

28:54.400 --> 28:58.227
- The Cookie Monster does not like this.
- If you find her so reprehensible,

28:58.352 --> 29:00.217
why did you have sex with her?

29:02.096 --> 29:04.788
Wait. That was supposed
to stay in the vault. Wasn't it?

29:04.913 --> 29:06.676
- JJ?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

29:06.954 --> 29:08.860
I'm emotionally underdeveloped.

29:09.615 --> 29:12.150
- You shagged my sister?
- You know what I'm like...

29:12.275 --> 29:14.840
half a bottle of Grappa and
I turn into a fucking machine gun...

29:15.247 --> 29:17.040
You fucked my sister?

29:35.947 --> 29:37.219
Just be, Freddie.

29:39.160 --> 29:40.160
Just be.

30:15.358 --> 30:16.357
Fuck!

30:17.334 --> 30:19.459
Bring it, Karen, bring it.

30:24.136 --> 30:25.407
What do you want?

30:25.719 --> 30:27.800
I was wondering if there was
anything else you wanted?

30:27.960 --> 30:29.985
- What?
- You've got this...

30:30.110 --> 30:32.747
Maybe you want my bedroom
for a tanning salon next.

30:32.867 --> 30:34.800
At least then you might
stand a chance tomorrow.

30:36.600 --> 30:39.040
Just let me rehearse,
and you can bitch at me after the final.

30:40.041 --> 30:41.935
I am so sorry.

30:42.960 --> 30:45.613
I forgot that's the only thing
that matters in the whole world.

30:45.738 --> 30:48.636
- Grow the fuck up.
- You don't see it, do you?

30:49.421 --> 30:51.276
You don't see what a stupid

30:51.769 --> 30:54.956
- fucking cliche you really are.
- Piss off, Freddie.

30:56.788 --> 30:58.687
So out of interest...

30:59.843 --> 31:03.102
What were you dreaming of
when you fucked my best friend?

31:09.040 --> 31:11.533
- It wasn't like that...
- He fucked you good, didn't he?

31:11.658 --> 31:13.000
I know your type, Karen.

31:13.957 --> 31:14.957
Love me...

31:15.969 --> 31:16.969
Love me...

31:17.894 --> 31:18.894
Love me.

31:19.028 --> 31:20.164
Look, stop it.

31:20.289 --> 31:22.720
You little fucking whore...

31:26.715 --> 31:28.015
Go to your room.

31:28.417 --> 31:29.552
Get some rest.

31:38.917 --> 31:41.280
Freddie, don't you ever speak
to your sister that way again.

31:41.664 --> 31:43.595
What are you gonna do about it?

31:52.233 --> 31:54.462
Every time I look at you,
I wonder...

31:56.553 --> 31:58.783
You've got
your mother's eyes, but...

32:00.186 --> 32:02.278
I don't know who you are any more.

32:02.929 --> 32:04.429
You just skate around.

32:05.498 --> 32:07.364
You just fucking skate around.

33:53.539 --> 33:54.360
Is Effy in?

33:56.400 --> 33:59.045
There's no-one here
but terrible old me...

33:59.976 --> 34:01.489
Do you know where she is?

34:02.534 --> 34:03.534
Please?

34:06.678 --> 34:09.577
She's at the water park, I think.

34:10.929 --> 34:12.339
She goes there to...

34:14.882 --> 34:16.335
get away from here.

34:51.639 --> 34:53.321
Effy! I wanna talk to you!

35:13.621 --> 35:15.829
<i>Hi. This is Effy.
I'm not talking right now.</i>

35:16.204 --> 35:18.779
<i>But leave a message
and maybe I'll get back to you...</i>

36:11.104 --> 36:13.603
- Effy, I've come to tell you...
- Freddie.

36:15.954 --> 36:17.454
I don't think I can...

36:30.793 --> 36:32.476
So, now I've told you, OK?

36:34.588 --> 36:35.770
Now you know...

37:29.602 --> 37:31.475
Jemma! That was fierce.

37:31.875 --> 37:32.875
Fierce!

37:37.696 --> 37:39.058
I didn't like it...

37:42.381 --> 37:44.518
I loved it!

37:44.887 --> 37:47.790
I loved it! I fucking loved it!

37:48.845 --> 37:51.988
Well, done! Thank you very much,
Jemma. Thank you.

37:53.388 --> 37:56.937
Okay, it's time for our third
and final act of the evening.

37:57.346 --> 38:00.653
Singing the song that took the Sexxbombz
to number one in two countries,

38:00.778 --> 38:03.186
one protectorate
and of course, Wales...

38:03.311 --> 38:05.403
it's Karen Mclair, with Ass To Ass!

39:32.741 --> 39:34.553
Absolutely fantastic!

39:40.861 --> 39:43.830
I'd like to dedicate that
to my mum, Mary Mclair.

39:43.955 --> 39:45.411
I love you so much...

39:50.624 --> 39:51.800
Shut up...

39:52.411 --> 39:54.458
Karen, Karen, that was amazing.

39:55.299 --> 39:58.022
You are not just
in this competition...

39:59.330 --> 40:01.079
you are this competition!

40:08.161 --> 40:10.955
What about you Sexxbombz,
are you feeling the love tonight?

40:14.066 --> 40:18.149
<i>I wanna see you
going ass to ass with you...</i>

40:18.274 --> 40:22.115
<i>I wanna see you going
ass to ass with me...</i>

40:26.918 --> 40:30.052
They're feeling the ass baby!
Fo' shizzle!

40:30.363 --> 40:33.501
They are all feeling the ass.
Thank you Karen, everybody.

40:36.963 --> 40:39.919
OK. It's now time to get voting
for your favourite...

40:40.044 --> 40:42.640
Honey? Jemma? Or Karen?

40:42.765 --> 40:46.062
Lines are open, get dialling now
and come back here in one hour.

40:46.187 --> 40:48.330
One of these three
lovely girls will be...

40:48.455 --> 40:50.929
the new Sexxbomb!

41:21.640 --> 41:22.731
Thanks, mate.

41:52.203 --> 41:55.242
What are you doing, man?
Let's go out and fucking celebrate!

41:55.367 --> 41:57.231
- What?
- She fucking lost...

41:57.531 --> 41:58.952
I'm not going anywhere.

41:59.077 --> 42:01.283
Okay, then.
We'll bring the party to you...

42:01.720 --> 42:02.727
Come on J...

42:06.624 --> 42:08.474
He wanted to come around...

42:08.826 --> 42:10.877
Just don't do anything bad, OK?

42:18.860 --> 42:20.437
Hello, Mr Mclair. Karen.

42:21.250 --> 42:22.306
Hello, JJ.

42:30.942 --> 42:33.393
Bad luck, Karen.
In the competition, like.

42:34.274 --> 42:35.405
But you know...

42:35.525 --> 42:37.157
What goes around comes around.

42:39.781 --> 42:41.797
How much did you lose by again?
15 votes?

42:43.823 --> 42:45.186
Well, that's funny, cos...

42:45.839 --> 42:48.437
that's about how many people
were in Keith's pub tonight.

42:49.577 --> 42:53.346
- You voted against her?
- Not just me. Everyone in there.

42:53.471 --> 42:55.472
- JJ, even.
- Cook, don't...

42:56.377 --> 42:57.684
You fucking did what?

42:57.809 --> 43:00.367
You took my shed,
I took your competition. Fair's fair.

43:00.841 --> 43:02.832
You little shit,
you ugly little bastard...

43:03.128 --> 43:07.350
Guys. Come on, let's go out?
You can watch me play pin the sausage...

43:07.475 --> 43:10.197
- I forgot how limber you were, Karen.
- What's going on?

43:17.001 --> 43:18.761
Come on. It's been a long day.

43:18.881 --> 43:19.881
You prick.

43:20.789 --> 43:23.222
You selfish fucking prick.

43:28.149 --> 43:31.014
- Freddie, please.
- Fucking do it then. You pussy.

43:47.672 --> 43:49.993
I really fucking love you,
you bastard.

43:51.241 --> 43:52.460
JJ, we're leaving, man.

43:59.668 --> 44:01.213
- JJ, I'm sorry.
- JJ!

44:06.001 --> 44:07.202
You fucking...

44:43.299 --> 44:47.150
<i>Hi. This is Effy. I'm not talking
right now but leave a message...</i>

45:04.030 --> 45:06.484
- Hi, is Ef...
- Give it up, will you?

45:07.984 --> 45:10.037
- What?
- Just fuck right off.

46:26.716 --> 46:28.716
You've got about
as much chance of fucking me

46:28.841 --> 46:31.247
as becoming the democratically
elected Student President.

46:31.719 --> 46:33.082
You? President?

46:33.391 --> 46:34.789
Yeah man. Problem?

46:35.738 --> 46:39.287
Vote for me!
Vote for non-stop party!

46:42.121 --> 46:45.472
- You're such a fucking joke.
- I'm a joke? You're fucking hilarious.

46:45.597 --> 46:47.008
Can we go somewhere?

46:47.466 --> 46:48.466
Anywhere?

46:49.305 --> 46:55.797
