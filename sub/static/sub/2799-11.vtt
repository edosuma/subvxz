00:15.516 --> 00:18.494
<i>LVPD. Officer Mularz. Can I help you?</i>

00:19.767 --> 00:21.892
<i>Is there somebody there?</i>

00:22.534 --> 00:27.065
I'd like to report a murder.

00:27.537 --> 00:29.572
<i>Your name?</i>

00:30.394 --> 00:33.442
<i>Hello? Is there somebody there?</i>

00:33.732 --> 00:43.818
The body can be found
at 1812 white oak road.

00:44.680 --> 00:48.460
<i>I'd like to help you.
Please identify yourself.</i>

00:48.580 --> 00:52.670
Send someone to pick up the body.

01:04.220 --> 01:09.182
So an anonymous call came
into metro about an hour ago.

01:09.252 --> 01:13.634
Investigating officer found the
dead body. The coroner's inside.

01:15.137 --> 01:19.639
The, uh... the door was open. Unlocked.

01:21.844 --> 01:26.376
So the house is owned by the
decedent, Hayden Bradford.

01:26.476 --> 01:28.762
Neighbor says he lives alone.

01:28.882 --> 01:33.083
The floor is covered in hair.
Has he got a cat or a dog?

01:33.183 --> 01:33.985
Nope.

01:34.797 --> 01:38.868
But as you can see our dead guy is...

01:38.948 --> 01:41.590
I guess you could say he's hirsute.

01:41.591 --> 01:43.729
"Hirsute" is an understatement.

01:43.730 --> 01:45.585
It's like he's wearing a pelt.

02:03.701 --> 02:07.510
Hey, David, would you grab that?

02:12.874 --> 02:14.518
Thanks.

02:16.383 --> 02:19.481
A missed call from a Michelle.

02:20.062 --> 02:23.070
She called six times since 3:53 P.M.

02:23.922 --> 02:27.210
Liver temp's 80 degrees.
Been dead around 12 hours.

02:27.601 --> 02:30.028
Which makes ToD around 3:00 P.M.

02:30.078 --> 02:31.742
Explains why he didn't take her calls.

02:32.945 --> 02:36.173
CoD... Bullet to the chest.

02:39.081 --> 02:42.609
These strands are smooth,
not coarse. They're human.

02:43.422 --> 02:44.655
Are the roots intact?

02:45.176 --> 02:45.898
Yeah.

02:48.454 --> 02:50.339
Evidently, this guy was shedding.

03:30.922 --> 03:32.697
Hey, Dave, James.

03:33.519 --> 03:34.511
Come on

03:35.945 --> 03:37.409
Hey, Dave, you've got to pick it up.

03:37.479 --> 03:40.065
- Lift with the knees, super Dave,
- Yeah.

03:40.085 --> 03:42.732
Thanks, I... have done this before.

03:45.840 --> 03:48.617
Hey. So, brass Bave us a quick briefing.

03:48.747 --> 03:49.559
How can we help?

03:50.061 --> 03:52.667
Warrick and I are processing
the interior, room to room.

03:52.798 --> 03:54.883
So that leaves the perimeter.

03:55.003 --> 03:55.575
Thanks.

04:04.718 --> 04:06.743
Well, this victim definitely
had a lady in his life.

04:06.813 --> 04:08.287
That's odd.

04:09.119 --> 04:12.678
There is not a single
feminine touch in this house.

04:18.923 --> 04:19.745
Michelle.

04:20.117 --> 04:21.701
Christmas, 2004.

04:21.731 --> 04:22.924
Proberbly it's got to
be the same Michelle that

04:22.954 --> 04:25.250
tried to reach him six
times on his cell phone.

04:43.095 --> 04:43.998
Broken window.

04:51.276 --> 04:52.259
Yeah.

04:53.321 --> 04:54.434
It slides.

04:55.096 --> 04:56.870
The front door was locked.

04:56.961 --> 05:00.680
The killer probably broke the
window and exited out the front.

05:02.324 --> 05:03.938
I'll need to print
the window, but, uh...

05:04.019 --> 05:06.344
why don't we get to this first.

05:07.768 --> 05:10.535
Doesn't look big enough
to have done the job.

05:27.949 --> 05:30.025
We have a print.

06:00.311 --> 06:03.640
"Hey, jackass
- this is your last chance.

06:03.750 --> 06:06.698
Pay your debt or I'll hunt you down."

06:07.490 --> 06:11.390
Makes our job easier when the
suspect prints out his motive.

06:11.540 --> 06:15.941
He has an e-mail printout
from casinodan@gmail.com

06:15.971 --> 06:19.280
to misterbradford@gmail.com.

06:20.643 --> 06:21.335
Well,

06:22.969 --> 06:26.338
that ain't no anthill.
That dirt's fresh.

06:28.423 --> 06:31.100
Looks like something's buried there.

06:38.027 --> 06:39.782
No, wait...

06:43.732 --> 06:46.649
.32 Beretta. Victim was shot, right?

06:46.769 --> 06:49.727
It's going to be hard to get a
print, but I'll get it to ballistics.

06:53.607 --> 06:54.910
Well, we knew he was hairy.

06:55.371 --> 06:56.975
I didn't realize the full extent.

06:57.126 --> 06:59.672
Hypertrichosis. I've only read about it.

07:00.605 --> 07:03.853
Excessive hair growth.
Genetic. Extremely rare.

07:04.535 --> 07:06.309
His case was relatively mild.

07:07.051 --> 07:10.279
In some individuals, hair grows
everywhere except the eyes and the mouth.

07:10.620 --> 07:12.169
The human werewolf syndrome.

07:12.204 --> 07:15.763
In Mexico, there's a family
30 members are afflicted.

07:15.903 --> 07:19.773
Two of the teen boys were recently
adopted by the national circus.

07:19.843 --> 07:23.202
Great. The bearded
lady, the dog-faced boy-

07:23.282 --> 07:26.230
physical deformities
as family entertainment.

07:26.490 --> 07:29.548
I cleared a path for the bullet.

07:32.897 --> 07:36.947
I figured you'd want to
get this to ballistics asap.

07:37.017 --> 07:37.939
Thanks, Al.

07:38.030 --> 07:41.007
You know, Gil, we're all
intrigued by our nightmares,

07:41.047 --> 07:44.697
and when we watch freak shows, basically
we're all thinking the same thing.

07:44.747 --> 07:47.834
Yeah, I'm glad they're
not looking at me.

07:47.935 --> 07:49.639
- Hey, Archie.
- Hey.

07:49.739 --> 07:51.714
Please tell me you've ID'd casino dan.

07:51.805 --> 07:55.955
Yep. The ISP provider sent
over the subscriber information

07:55.975 --> 07:58.231
for a casinodan@gmail.com.

07:58.792 --> 08:02.351
It's registered to a Dan Nobler,
who runs a gambling web site.

08:02.492 --> 08:05.419
If I wanted to visit Dan
in person, where would I go?

08:05.549 --> 08:08.487
Well, the server for
casinodan.com is in Argentina,

08:08.527 --> 08:10.793
which allows him to
skirt U.S. gaming laws.

08:10.833 --> 08:14.392
However, he's got a
Nevada business license.

08:14.402 --> 08:15.775
And I have the address.

08:18.733 --> 08:20.046
Anything else I should know?

08:20.076 --> 08:22.061
Uh, well, I don't know if it's relevant,

08:22.071 --> 08:25.280
but he recently opened an
account with peopledectors.com.

08:25.350 --> 08:26.673
Who was he looking for?

08:26.743 --> 08:28.758
I don't know. I'll triage
the computer's hard drive.

08:28.778 --> 08:30.723
Reconstruct the deleted e-mails.

08:30.774 --> 08:32.958
I'll get back to you on that.

08:34.162 --> 08:35.395
Can I help you?

08:36.318 --> 08:38.052
You Dan Nobler?

08:38.131 --> 08:39.195
Yeah.

08:39.205 --> 08:40.669
We're from the crime lab.

08:40.708 --> 08:42.453
We need to ask you a few questions.

08:42.462 --> 08:45.260
Look, if you're here about my business
you can save it for my attorney

08:45.351 --> 08:48.138
No, actually we're inquiring
about a mr. Hayden Bradford.

08:48.218 --> 08:50.293
You sent him some threatening e-mails.

08:51.847 --> 08:54.153
Bradford is a lying son of a bitch.

08:54.233 --> 08:55.747
Care to elaborate on that?

08:55.797 --> 08:57.932
I run an online gambling
business. Bradford had an account,

08:58.564 --> 09:00.880
ran up $10,000 in debt
and refused to pay.

09:00.930 --> 09:03.868
Isn't it true in online gambling
you have to submit your credit card,

09:03.908 --> 09:06.133
prior to gambling,
to insure your losses?

09:06.173 --> 09:06.915
That's true.

09:06.935 --> 09:09.763
And when Bradford was
winning, it wasn't a problem.

09:09.863 --> 09:10.815
But when his luck changed,

09:10.885 --> 09:14.695
he called his credit card holder
and said the charges were fraudulent.

09:14.705 --> 09:17.272
The credit card company issued
a charge back and I got screwed.

09:17.382 --> 09:19.718
Is that when you
decided to hunt him down?

09:19.898 --> 09:23.878
Look, I wrote him an
e-mail hoping to scare him.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.796
Sorry. I was angry.

09:27.678 --> 09:30.204
If I write an apology, can we drop this?

09:30.235 --> 09:32.540
No, mr. Nobler, I'm
sorry, we can't do that.

09:32.661 --> 09:33.864
Mr. Bradford's dead.

09:39.318 --> 09:42.576
Any other questions, contact
my lawyer. We're done here.

09:48.140 --> 09:48.892
You see that?

09:48.892 --> 09:50.443
Yeah, the guy's a jerk.

09:51.017 --> 09:54.626
No, he wiped his feet on the mat.

09:57.805 --> 10:00.792
I'm hoping to get a
little trace evidence here.

10:02.176 --> 10:03.850
Yeah, you see these pebbles?

10:04.491 --> 10:07.489
They look like the same ones that
were found at the crime scene.

10:23.389 --> 10:25.705
Fire in the hole!

10:52.904 --> 10:54.138
- Bobby.
- Hey.

10:54.859 --> 10:57.747
So, that, uh, buried
gun y'all recovered,

10:58.629 --> 11:00.444
wasn't used to kill Bradford.

11:01.967 --> 11:03.531
GRCs aren't even close.

11:03.832 --> 11:06.634
Most bullets are copper,

11:06.669 --> 11:08.674
but take a look at the fatal bullet.

11:09.878 --> 11:11.903
It's silver.

11:14.790 --> 11:16.394
How do you kill a werewolf?

11:23.863 --> 11:25.196
No one's home.

11:25.567 --> 11:26.861
We want to see the wolfman.

11:26.901 --> 11:28.635
Yeah, well, he's not
available right now.

11:28.705 --> 11:30.690
I am trying to prep him for autopsy.

11:30.740 --> 11:31.863
Wow.

11:32.074 --> 11:34.380
And I thought Robin
Williams had hairy arms.

11:34.470 --> 11:35.011
Can I touch him?

11:35.071 --> 11:36.104
You mean "pet" him.

11:36.164 --> 11:39.132
No! You may not touch
or pet the decedent.

11:39.473 --> 11:40.706
Is it soft like fur or...?

11:40.876 --> 11:42.681
I was supposed to have
him prepped hours ago.

11:42.691 --> 11:44.165
Please. Okay, you guys gotta go.

11:44.335 --> 11:45.227
Relax, Dave.

11:45.247 --> 11:47.212
It's not every day that
chaka ends up on a slab.

11:47.222 --> 11:48.445
Yeah, I need you to leave.

11:48.736 --> 11:49.538
Whoa.

11:50.039 --> 11:53.288
Fine, but if I get a sleestak in
my lab, and you want to see it,

11:53.368 --> 11:54.561
I'm gonna get cranky.

11:55.483 --> 11:58.331
Mr. Moyer, you're here
about Hayden Bradford.

11:58.371 --> 11:59.514
- Do you know him?
- Of course.

12:00.135 --> 12:02.321
He's one of my closest friends.

12:02.481 --> 12:07.374
Yeah... yeah, I'm sorry. We
found his body this morning.

12:07.434 --> 12:11.594
You didn't recently try to
break in his home... did you?

12:12.998 --> 12:14.181
Excuse me. What?

12:14.441 --> 12:19.815
We found a rock by a broken
window, with your fingerprint on it.

12:20.537 --> 12:21.419
Is that funny?

12:21.560 --> 12:23.334
No. It's just. Uh...

12:23.354 --> 12:25.951
last week we were
playing toss with a ball.

12:29.419 --> 12:32.477
That still doesn't explain to me
how your fingerprint got there.

12:32.718 --> 12:36.598
There was glass everywhere, so
I knocked out the loose pieces.

12:36.658 --> 12:38.593
You guys being good friends...

12:38.663 --> 12:41.229
you were aware of his
medical condition, right?

12:42.001 --> 12:45.831
That he was a hairy SOB?
Yeah. Of course. Why?

12:45.911 --> 12:49.029
Do you know why anybody'd
want to hurt him?

12:49.130 --> 12:51.766
He's a friendly, quiet guy.

12:51.806 --> 12:55.666
I've known him since high school.
He's been dating my sister.

12:58.072 --> 12:59.546
Oh, God.

13:00.087 --> 13:01.992
She doesn't know yet, does she?

13:02.032 --> 13:03.275
Who, Michelle?

13:03.697 --> 13:04.970
Yeah.

13:05.531 --> 13:07.947
I tried to call her cell phone and...

13:08.038 --> 13:12.228
She's at my parents, in Pahrump.
Her cell's probably out of range.

13:12.258 --> 13:16.028
But you can get me their home
number, address, all that?

13:16.108 --> 13:17.652
Sure.

13:17.782 --> 13:19.767
But if it's okay, I'd...

13:19.928 --> 13:22.394
I should break the
news to her in person.

13:24.379 --> 13:25.382
I've been waiting for you.

13:25.763 --> 13:28.760
Sorry. I headed out as
soon as I got your page.

13:28.860 --> 13:30.866
Really? 'Cause, uh...

13:30.956 --> 13:34.084
I left a voicemail several hours ago.

13:34.224 --> 13:35.417
What's up?

13:35.537 --> 13:38.044
The anonymous call was
traced to this phone booth,

13:38.064 --> 13:41.533
so I figured you'd want to process.

13:43.026 --> 13:45.422
There is fingerprint
powder on the phone.

13:45.432 --> 13:47.117
Yeah, I got bored waiting.

13:47.367 --> 13:49.753
I thought you might need some help.

13:49.874 --> 13:55.077
No usable prints, but
check out the floor.

13:55.999 --> 13:58.014
There's a lot of hair.

13:58.285 --> 14:00.280
Similar to the crime scene.

14:00.340 --> 14:04.220
The victim was killed 12 hours
before this call was made.

14:04.310 --> 14:08.682
If that's his hair,
what's it doing here?

14:09.393 --> 14:11.078
The hair isn't Hayden's.

14:11.108 --> 14:12.842
The chromosomes are xx.

14:12.852 --> 14:13.534
- Female.
- Yeah.

14:13.594 --> 14:17.404
So I took the liberty of comparing
the sample's DNA to the victim's DNA.

14:17.464 --> 14:19.459
There are seven alleles in common.

14:19.489 --> 14:20.889
Brother and sister.

14:21.945 --> 14:23.910
She's likely our anonymous caller.

14:23.970 --> 14:26.637
Yeah, given the amount
of hair that you collected

14:26.667 --> 14:29.665
she's also probably a very hairy woman.

14:31.149 --> 14:32.953
- Wendy, can you do me a favor?
- Sure?

14:32.983 --> 14:36.001
Can you see if any of the
follicles from the crime scene

14:36.061 --> 14:38.668
are a match to the hairs
from the phone booth?

14:38.718 --> 14:41.405
You want to see if the sister
was in the victim's house.

14:41.425 --> 14:44.222
If she was, she's not just the caller,

14:44.272 --> 14:46.107
she's a suspect.

14:46.227 --> 14:47.911
I hear the vic has a sister.

14:47.951 --> 14:49.024
A twin sister,

14:49.044 --> 14:51.149
in fact. I tracked down the
victim's birth certificate.

14:51.270 --> 14:54.247
He was born to a Rita
Bradford in Fresno, California.

14:54.307 --> 14:56.202
Ms. Bradford apparently had twins,

14:56.242 --> 14:57.836
Hayden and Allison.

14:57.876 --> 14:59.330
There's no record of any other children.

14:59.360 --> 15:01.125
I'm assuming you contacted Allison.

15:01.185 --> 15:02.468
Well, that's where it gets odd.

15:02.478 --> 15:05.426
Allison Bradford has
never filed with the IRS,

15:05.566 --> 15:07.110
has never had a driver's license,

15:07.130 --> 15:08.233
has never filled out a w-2.

15:08.253 --> 15:10.268
How do you go through
life without a paper trail?

15:10.338 --> 15:11.311
She's dead.

15:11.361 --> 15:13.416
There's no record of
a death certificate.

15:13.446 --> 15:16.093
We found her hair in the phone booth.

15:16.143 --> 15:19.722
And DNA just confirmed that
some of the hair follicles

15:19.762 --> 15:21.978
that we collected at
the crime scene are hers.

15:22.078 --> 15:26.880
Well, other than hair, when you and Warrick processed
the house did you find any evidence of the sister?

15:26.950 --> 15:28.544
No, but we were not looking for one.

15:29.005 --> 15:31.231
We are now.

16:19.383 --> 16:20.677
Catherine, I've covered the kitchen.

16:20.717 --> 16:23.213
I've found no evidence
of a sister living here.

16:23.223 --> 16:24.777
Ditto for the bedroom.

16:24.807 --> 16:26.552
I think I'm gonna take a look outside.

16:26.592 --> 16:28.476
I'll do the same.

16:28.617 --> 16:30.141
Thanks, guys.

17:06.403 --> 17:08.358
Please go away.

17:13.369 --> 17:14.453
Allison?

17:14.553 --> 17:16.258
This is my home.

17:16.338 --> 17:17.922
I would like you to leave.

17:18.021 --> 17:19.095
Allison...

17:21.411 --> 17:23.546
I need to talk with you.

17:23.797 --> 17:25.340
Can you please come out?

17:25.461 --> 17:27.286
I'd rather not.

17:27.455 --> 17:32.419
Allison, my name is Catherine Willows.
I'm with the Las Vegas crime lab.

17:32.690 --> 17:36.800
I know that you suffer
from hypertrichosis.

17:36.840 --> 17:40.138
I understand why you would
rather not talk with me.

17:41.211 --> 17:45.703
But we need to discuss
your brother's murder.

17:46.986 --> 17:49.392
Would you please come out?

17:59.808 --> 18:01.904
May I...?

18:02.876 --> 18:05.102
Would you step out? Please?

18:05.884 --> 18:07.598
You want to see what I look like?

18:08.180 --> 18:11.458
No, I... no.

18:11.919 --> 18:14.847
I don't want you to
have to hide from me.

18:14.887 --> 18:15.919
Allison...

18:16.902 --> 18:19.027
I'm a scientist.

18:22.175 --> 18:26.526
Excess body hair does not evoke fear...

18:26.616 --> 18:29.644
or morbid fascination.

18:30.727 --> 18:34.005
It's simply a genetic quirk,

18:34.085 --> 18:35.449
like...

18:35.539 --> 18:38.106
blue eyes or flat feet.

18:53.996 --> 18:57.054
It's nice to meet you, Allison.

19:02.508 --> 19:05.194
How can I help you, ms. Willows?

19:11.801 --> 19:14.859
What can you tell me about
your brother's murder?

19:14.949 --> 19:19.090
No one knows I live here,
so when we get a visitor,

19:19.210 --> 19:21.446
I go to my room.

19:22.378 --> 19:24.955
Yesterday, around 3:30,

19:25.085 --> 19:26.529
the doorbell rang.

19:26.639 --> 19:28.604
Just a sec!

19:31.521 --> 19:35.100
And when I came out of
my room, Hayden was dead.

19:35.361 --> 19:38.710
Why did you wait 12
hours to call the police?

19:38.750 --> 19:41.797
Because I didn't want the
call traced to the house,

19:41.928 --> 19:44.183
back to me, so...

19:44.354 --> 19:48.384
I waited till midnight, and then

19:48.454 --> 19:50.910
I walked to a pay phone.

19:52.515 --> 19:55.161
You weren't supposed to find me.

19:55.422 --> 19:59.282
Do you have any idea why someone
would want to hurt your brother?

20:00.645 --> 20:02.009
No.

20:04.395 --> 20:07.051
He was my only friend.

20:07.884 --> 20:11.783
he was my connection
to the outside world.

20:12.575 --> 20:15.002
What about your parents?

20:15.292 --> 20:20.095
I never knew my father. My mother
died when we were teenagers.

20:20.175 --> 20:23.142
No one else knows that you exist?

20:23.263 --> 20:27.012
I hope... I hope you'll help me.

20:27.975 --> 20:30.391
Help you
- with what?

20:30.722 --> 20:33.138
Staying secret.

20:34.391 --> 20:36.797
It's best for everyone.

20:43.454 --> 20:46.281
Hey, Grissom, you got a second?

20:46.311 --> 20:52.497
Did you know the word "werewolf" was
derived from the old english word "wargwolf"

20:52.597 --> 20:55.164
which is a synonym for "serial killer"?

20:55.194 --> 20:56.597
No, I didn't.

20:56.838 --> 21:01.239
Imagine if you had some
deep, dark secret...

21:01.339 --> 21:03.745
something that brought
you tremendous shame.

21:03.936 --> 21:07.916
But instead of being able to hide it
away you had to wear it out on your skin

21:08.096 --> 21:11.405
so that the first time anyone
saw you, they saw your secret.

21:11.485 --> 21:12.949
You talking about Allison?

21:13.039 --> 21:14.222
Yeah.

21:14.392 --> 21:16.889
Catherine said she's
scared to death of people

21:16.929 --> 21:19.415
and what they'll think of her.

21:19.525 --> 21:24.388
Well, if that's the case, why not
try electrolysis or depilatory lasers?

21:24.528 --> 21:29.040
With that much hair-be a lot of
scarring and a great deal of pain

21:29.110 --> 21:31.386
Plus, imagine how expensive it would be.

21:31.476 --> 21:32.930
What have you got?

21:33.010 --> 21:34.173
Well, I just ran into Archie.

21:34.223 --> 21:38.554
The decedent used a company called
peopledetectors.com to try to locate his mother.

21:38.644 --> 21:40.409
Catherine spoke to Allison.
Their mother's dead.

21:41.461 --> 21:43.917
Apparently not. She's alive and well,

21:44.068 --> 21:47.486
and has an address in Henderson, so
I'm gonna go out there, check it out.

21:47.918 --> 21:49.462
- Hey, Nick.
- Yeah.

21:50.173 --> 21:53.151
- Bring her back here, will you?
- Sure. Why?

21:53.442 --> 21:54.915
I want to talk to her.

21:55.377 --> 21:57.402
Find out why a mother would play dead.

21:58.434 --> 22:00.339
Oh, good, you're here.

22:00.449 --> 22:01.402
I love an audience.

22:01.452 --> 22:03.377
Well, don't expect any applause.

22:04.169 --> 22:04.871
What do you got?

22:05.653 --> 22:10.204
I compared pebbles from the crime scene
to the pebbles from Dan Nobler's doormat.

22:10.324 --> 22:11.467
They're consistent with each other-

22:11.568 --> 22:13.863
a composite commonly
known as pea gravel.

22:13.974 --> 22:17.573
The pebbles weren't the only trace
elements I found in that doormat.

22:17.663 --> 22:20.651
I also found several slivers of glass...

22:20.761 --> 22:23.949
glass consistent with a broken window.

22:23.999 --> 22:27.288
I'm here about pebbles
and glass. Come on.

22:27.358 --> 22:29.062
Look, this is ridiculous.

22:29.142 --> 22:33.473
I mean, we're talking about trace
evidence on a doormat? Come on.

22:33.574 --> 22:34.937
Besides, I read the file.

22:35.027 --> 22:38.115
A guy named Brent Moyer already
admitted to breaking the window.

22:38.215 --> 22:39.348
This is true; he did.

22:39.468 --> 22:43.699
But we believe that mr. Nobler
here stepped in the shards of glass.

22:43.950 --> 22:47.098
Listen, neither the glass nor the
pebbles are probative on their own,

22:47.138 --> 22:50.216
but together, they put your
client at the crime scene.

22:50.236 --> 22:53.274
Not to mention, his threatening
e-mail gives us motive.

22:53.404 --> 22:54.677
Fine. I was there.

22:54.757 --> 22:55.599
Dan...

22:55.630 --> 22:58.507
No, look, I get ripped off
by jerks all over the world.

22:58.647 --> 22:59.630
This guy was a local.

22:59.690 --> 23:01.825
I knew his address and, yeah,
I wanted to shake him down.

23:01.855 --> 23:06.658
Let him know that by declaring credit
card fraud, he was stealing from me.

23:06.798 --> 23:08.542
Okay, I'm listening.

23:10.848 --> 23:13.405
A few days ago, I
went over to his house.

23:13.675 --> 23:17.385
Then I started thinking, "what
if this guy's like twice my size?"

23:18.026 --> 23:22.067
I figured I should get a look at
him before I had our "conversation,"

23:22.127 --> 23:25.124
so I went around back...

23:35.671 --> 23:38.178
Hey... hey, hey!

23:39.832 --> 23:42.719
At first, I thought he
was wearing a costume,

23:42.890 --> 23:45.105
but then I realized, it was...

23:45.396 --> 23:47.381
it was real hair.

23:47.632 --> 23:49.466
Disgusting, right?

23:49.597 --> 23:51.541
What happened next?

23:51.762 --> 23:53.887
Well, when the dude saw me, I took off.

23:53.968 --> 23:55.461
Why?

23:55.582 --> 23:58.359
Uh, he was a freak of nature.

23:59.923 --> 24:02.740
I no longer wish to speak with him.

25:00.176 --> 25:01.108
Hey, man.

25:02.603 --> 25:03.647
Hey.

25:03.985 --> 25:05.209
What are you smiling about?

25:05.419 --> 25:09.389
Oh, I was just thinking of the
Howling II; the werewolf bitch.

25:09.439 --> 25:12.116
I don't care what anyone says. It
was much better than the first one.

25:12.146 --> 25:12.677
Is it?

25:12.808 --> 25:14.853
Yeah, yeah. I got the whole anthology.

25:14.923 --> 25:15.505
Want to borrow it?

25:15.535 --> 25:18.262
No, thanks. I would like
to know about my bullet

25:18.282 --> 25:22.101
however. I assume it was homemade since
the manufacturer doesn't sell it in silver

25:22.202 --> 25:25.169
Right. Simple clamshell mold.

25:28.879 --> 25:33.631
92.5% pure with trace amounts of
copper, nickel and chromium lead.

25:33.721 --> 25:37.681
Elemental properties are consistent
with sterling silver jewelry.

25:37.711 --> 25:40.067
And sterling silver has
a high melting point.

25:40.107 --> 25:43.045
Someone went through a
lot of trouble to make it.

25:43.586 --> 25:45.621
Sorry I didn't get here sooner.

25:45.751 --> 25:47.887
I was pretty upset.

25:47.947 --> 25:51.797
Michelle, your relationship
with Hayden, was it serious?

25:51.887 --> 25:53.762
We were engaged.

25:54.644 --> 25:56.729
I can't believe he's gone.

25:56.800 --> 25:58.163
The day he died,

25:58.303 --> 26:01.201
you called him six times.

26:01.311 --> 26:04.599
There was a golf tournament
on ESPN that night.

26:04.670 --> 26:07.797
He wanted me to tape it for him.

26:08.038 --> 26:14.053
I was trying to reach him because I was
at my folks' place and the VCR was broken.

26:15.437 --> 26:17.793
Sounds so silly now.

26:19.638 --> 26:22.114
I'd like to see him...

26:22.234 --> 26:24.249
to say good-bye.

26:27.347 --> 26:29.503
He's with the coroner.

26:32.260 --> 26:34.806
Michelle, I understand
that you were at your folks

26:34.816 --> 26:37.212
and you were trying to get
ahold of Hayden on your cell

26:37.403 --> 26:40.290
but we were unable to reach
you on it. Can you explain?

26:40.340 --> 26:45.152
I called Hayden so many
times that my battery died.

26:45.253 --> 26:46.686
I'm sorry.

26:46.716 --> 26:49.523
Do you have any idea
who could have done this?

26:51.278 --> 26:54.045
You know about his condition, right?

26:54.506 --> 26:56.972
It made him really sweet.

26:57.684 --> 26:59.689
I mean, it was like he was

26:59.789 --> 27:05.885
constantly trying to make up for his physical
imperfections by doing everything perfectly.

27:06.055 --> 27:09.454
He was the perfect boyfriend,

27:09.665 --> 27:11.850
the perfect lover,

27:12.371 --> 27:14.687
my best friend.

27:16.993 --> 27:21.545
I don't know what I'm
going to do without him.

27:23.740 --> 27:26.989
I was in labor for 27 hours.

27:28.823 --> 27:30.919
They didn't want to come out.

27:31.079 --> 27:32.643
Who could blame 'em.

27:32.823 --> 27:35.370
Mrs. Bradford, why does
Allison think you're dead?

27:35.440 --> 27:37.806
I thought it would be easier.

27:38.939 --> 27:40.643
Easier than what?

27:41.275 --> 27:43.962
I did the best I could, mr. Grissom.

27:44.934 --> 27:47.310
Their father couldn't look at 'em.

27:47.390 --> 27:49.736
Took off when they were a few weeks old.

27:49.847 --> 27:52.814
Babies are supposed to be cute.

27:55.932 --> 27:58.398
Mrs. Bradford...?

27:58.890 --> 28:01.586
At the time, we were living in Fresno.

28:01.767 --> 28:04.694
Family, friends stopped visiting.

28:04.805 --> 28:06.629
They were scared of my children.

28:06.719 --> 28:07.882
Especially Allison.

28:07.892 --> 28:11.231
She... she looked like...

28:12.775 --> 28:15.492
when she started nursery
school, the kids teased her,

28:15.592 --> 28:18.048
called her names, made her cry.

28:18.168 --> 28:20.244
So you moved to Vegas

28:20.314 --> 28:22.590
and decided to keep her a secret?

28:22.680 --> 28:24.815
It was best for everyone.

28:26.881 --> 28:30.199
But she became completely
dependent on me,

28:30.239 --> 28:33.437
and for 18 years, I took care of her.

28:33.497 --> 28:37.728
I'm sorry, but I still don't
understand why she believes you're dead.

28:38.640 --> 28:43.703
One day, Allison wanted
to take a walk... outside.

28:44.425 --> 28:47.152
I didn't want anyone to see her.

28:47.884 --> 28:49.608
We had a fight.

28:49.819 --> 28:51.934
I locked her in her room-

28:52.636 --> 28:54.842
my own child-

28:55.223 --> 28:57.478
because she wanted fresh air.

28:59.744 --> 29:02.351
At that moment, I
knew I needed to leave.

29:02.361 --> 29:07.263
I told Hayden to tell her
I was in a car accident.

29:07.353 --> 29:09.920
Two days later, he put on a black suit,

29:10.030 --> 29:12.326
told her he was going to my funeral.

29:12.667 --> 29:16.456
And she didn't go because
she couldn't leave the house.

29:19.003 --> 29:24.697
You thought it would be easier for her to
accept your death than your abandonment?

29:25.279 --> 29:27.946
Please don't judge me.

29:28.196 --> 29:30.843
I spend enough time doing that.

29:31.134 --> 29:34.202
I'm just trying to find
out who killed your son.

29:35.505 --> 29:38.462
I haven't seen either
of them for seven years.

29:38.533 --> 29:39.635
I wouldn't have any idea.

29:41.019 --> 29:43.034
You know, mrs. Bradford,

29:44.006 --> 29:46.282
your daughter's all alone now.

29:46.934 --> 29:48.799
It's not too late for
you to go back to her.

29:48.839 --> 29:50.453
And tell her what?

29:52.959 --> 29:57.671
That I faked my death
to escape from her?

29:58.704 --> 30:01.461
How do you say that to
your own flesh and blood?

30:12.263 --> 30:14.459
What's up with the 911?

30:14.479 --> 30:17.454
David didn't notice the victim's
lividity at the crime scene

30:17.554 --> 30:20.090
because it was obscured
by his body hair.

30:20.219 --> 30:22.057
But when we shaved him...

30:22.116 --> 30:24.712
well, check out his left side.

30:24.752 --> 30:26.799
So it was on his side
where the blood settled.

30:26.848 --> 30:30.303
Correct, but he was found faceup.

30:34.795 --> 30:37.181
So, uh, somebody moved him

30:37.271 --> 30:39.308
several hours postmortem.

30:39.527 --> 30:40.755
There's more.

30:40.885 --> 30:43.041
Vic was found on a hardwood floor,

30:43.132 --> 30:45.967
but when david brushed
his body hair for trace,

30:45.977 --> 30:48.562
he found blue carpet fibers.

30:51.537 --> 30:55.401
Well, there was blue
carpet in the sister's room.

30:58.715 --> 31:00.372
Hayden was shot through the chest,

31:00.403 --> 31:02.998
it would have exsanguinated on impact.

31:03.107 --> 31:05.054
Any blood in the sister's room?

31:05.115 --> 31:08.997
I'll get back to you on that one.

31:17.014 --> 31:19.710
Allison, it's Catherine.

31:19.919 --> 31:21.886
I need you to step out.

31:22.545 --> 31:24.212
Who else is there?

31:25.530 --> 31:27.387
There's another woman with me.

31:27.497 --> 31:29.923
Allison, I'm detective Curtis.

31:39.277 --> 31:41.703
I need to get inside your room.

31:45.287 --> 31:46.835
Thank you.

33:39.754 --> 33:42.270
I don't know anything about it.

33:43.100 --> 33:44.247
You can't expect us to believe

33:44.388 --> 33:48.392
that you live in a secret
room that only you go into,

33:48.471 --> 33:51.907
yet you can't explain why
your bed is covering up blood.

33:53.974 --> 33:55.162
Did you kill him?

33:55.252 --> 33:56.290
What?!

33:57.788 --> 33:58.727
Did you?

33:59.247 --> 34:00.604
Hayden's all I had.

34:01.154 --> 34:04.159
He's the only one that knew about me.

34:04.290 --> 34:05.657
Why would I kill him?

34:06.007 --> 34:07.954
Because he was going to leave you...

34:08.004 --> 34:09.382
for Michelle.

34:09.762 --> 34:11.498
That had to have been scary for you.

34:11.928 --> 34:14.434
You think I'm some sort of animal?

34:14.964 --> 34:16.761
I wanted him to be happy.

34:16.831 --> 34:19.388
I loved Hayden, I
wanted him to be happy.

34:19.927 --> 34:21.594
Did Michelle know about you?

34:21.734 --> 34:25.130
No, but he said that
he was going to tell her

34:25.199 --> 34:26.937
and that she was going to move in here

34:27.127 --> 34:30.431
and she would accept me
- Hayden promised.

34:30.752 --> 34:32.040
Allison...

34:33.428 --> 34:35.405
if you didn't kill him,

34:36.024 --> 34:37.742
who did?

34:39.429 --> 34:40.687
Okay, I'm sorry.

34:40.757 --> 34:42.924
We can do this here or
we can take this downtown.

34:42.974 --> 34:44.482
No, please.

34:44.552 --> 34:45.989
Please.

34:46.899 --> 34:48.766
I know that you're scared...

34:49.525 --> 34:52.800
but you have got to
tell us what happened.

34:54.159 --> 34:56.045
The doorbell rang.

34:56.614 --> 34:58.423
I went into my room.

34:58.682 --> 35:00.480
Allison, where's the gun?

35:01.169 --> 35:04.114
Damn it, Allison, where's the gun?

35:06.131 --> 35:07.889
And when he was shot, what did you do?

35:08.019 --> 35:08.998
I hid.

35:09.417 --> 35:11.204
Behind the door.

35:24.296 --> 35:26.003
Was the television on?

35:26.043 --> 35:27.251
No.

35:27.401 --> 35:29.658
It's busted. It hasn't worked in years.

35:29.718 --> 35:33.063
So you had a pretty good
view of the living room

35:33.153 --> 35:35.460
through the reflection in the tube.

35:36.149 --> 35:37.737
What did you see?

35:52.296 --> 35:53.854
Freak.

35:55.771 --> 35:58.707
You're sure that it was Brent?

35:58.847 --> 36:01.693
I've seen him through the
peephole. They were best friends.

36:01.822 --> 36:03.320
Okay, um...

36:03.373 --> 36:05.481
let's just go back to the gun.

36:05.640 --> 36:07.277
A couple of days ago,

36:07.287 --> 36:10.433
Hayden said he saw a guy

36:10.862 --> 36:13.878
sneaking around the back. So
he bought me a gun for safety.

36:13.928 --> 36:19.879
But I don't like guns so... I
just buried it in the backyard.

36:20.459 --> 36:22.506
Yes, we found it.

36:22.915 --> 36:24.203
Allison...

36:24.882 --> 36:27.278
why was it so difficult for
you to tell us the truth?

36:27.328 --> 36:31.432
I think you're going to make
me testify and I won't do that.

36:33.040 --> 36:38.722
I want Brent to go to jail, but
I won't be the sideshow freak.

36:39.121 --> 36:43.854
Well, we can try to
build a case without you.

36:44.414 --> 36:46.711
You can't get a warrant
unless she goes on record.

36:46.741 --> 36:50.155
Well, just hear me out. We have a rock
with Brent Moyer's fingerprints on it.

36:50.206 --> 36:53.031
Yeah, but Allison told you that
Brent entered through the front door.

36:53.091 --> 36:54.479
The rock is extraneous
evidence, isn't it?

36:54.529 --> 36:56.137
Well, let's just leave
Allison's testimony out of it.

36:56.257 --> 37:00.580
We simply inform the judge that our
suspect's fingerprints were on a rock

37:00.650 --> 37:03.446
that may have been used to break
a window at the murder scene.

37:03.456 --> 37:06.132
If you have no qualms about
filing the petition, then file it.

37:06.152 --> 37:08.169
Oh, no, I don't have any
qualms. It's just that

37:08.199 --> 37:11.874
my moral compass doesn't always
point in the same direction as yours.

37:11.904 --> 37:14.290
So if I tell you not
to file it, you won't?

37:14.450 --> 37:17.545
I'd take it under advisement. Why,
is that what you're recommending?

37:17.615 --> 37:19.602
How many times have we been
prevented from getting a warrant

37:19.633 --> 37:20.951
when we knew we had the right guy?

37:21.201 --> 37:22.429
Way too many.

37:22.469 --> 37:25.704
Right. So rock and roll.

37:33.992 --> 37:37.057
Las Vegas PD. We have a search warrant.

37:38.595 --> 37:39.815
What's going on?

38:28.776 --> 38:30.547
Why would I kill my best friend?

38:32.029 --> 38:34.272
That's a very good question.

38:34.762 --> 38:39.246
A bullet clamshell isn't
enough for the DA to file.

38:40.107 --> 38:42.590
What am I missing here?

38:42.900 --> 38:47.094
Our trace lab analyzed the
silver found in the bullet mold.

38:47.134 --> 38:51.600
It's identical composition
to the bullet in the victim.

38:52.380 --> 38:55.082
DA says it's a slam dunk.

38:55.624 --> 38:57.365
Hayden was going to marry my sister.

38:57.395 --> 38:59.267
Brent, I recommend that...

39:00.408 --> 39:02.981
I couldn't let that happen.

39:03.912 --> 39:05.514
He was diseased.

39:05.564 --> 39:07.746
Wasn't a problem for me.

39:07.956 --> 39:10.109
But my sister deserved better.

39:10.358 --> 39:12.061
So you killed him?

39:12.101 --> 39:13.762
Did you see his body?

39:15.624 --> 39:19.077
Hayden was a monster
passing for a regular joe.

39:19.608 --> 39:21.820
My parents blamed me

39:21.981 --> 39:23.943
for introducing them.

39:24.963 --> 39:27.566
You know, the werewolf
disease, it's hereditary.

39:28.988 --> 39:30.690
It means my sister

39:30.790 --> 39:33.132
could've given birth to freaks.

39:33.393 --> 39:35.755
And the silver bullet?

39:35.905 --> 39:38.038
Figured it was appropriate.

39:38.138 --> 39:41.050
So you left your parents',

39:41.201 --> 39:44.574
you went back to your
place to make the bullet

39:44.594 --> 39:46.205
and then you went over to Hayden's.

39:46.306 --> 39:48.428
Yeah.

39:48.468 --> 39:50.800
So it was premeditated.

39:50.900 --> 39:53.944
I guess you can forget heat of the
moment as a mitigating factor here.

39:53.974 --> 39:55.635
I did the right thing.

39:56.316 --> 39:58.408
My sister's out there waiting.

39:58.509 --> 40:00.421
Since I confessed,

40:00.946 --> 40:03.280
can I at least go out and talk to her?

40:03.541 --> 40:05.494
Explain why I did it.

40:05.714 --> 40:08.689
Why don't I do that for you.

40:24.574 --> 40:26.648
Ms. Moyer...

40:27.029 --> 40:31.025
your brother confessed
to killing Hayden.

40:38.668 --> 40:41.580
After our last conversation,
I checked the TV listings.

40:41.581 --> 40:44.276
There was no golf tournament that night.

40:44.758 --> 40:49.546
I think you were calling
Hayden to warn him about Brent.

40:53.211 --> 40:57.188
I had just announced our
engagement to my family.

40:58.570 --> 41:00.553
Brent flipped out.

41:01.014 --> 41:02.467
I was upset.

41:03.147 --> 41:06.272
Everyone was yelling at me.

41:06.473 --> 41:11.401
I went for a long walk to clear my head.
And when I got back, Brent was gone.

41:12.543 --> 41:16.128
He told my parents that he was
going to "speak" with Hayden.

41:16.148 --> 41:18.151
But you had your doubts.

41:18.673 --> 41:21.207
My brother has a temper.

41:21.227 --> 41:23.660
Why didn't you tell us this before?

41:25.254 --> 41:29.330
When Brent called and told
me that Hayden was dead,

41:30.452 --> 41:32.786
he said that if I told you guys..

41:32.866 --> 41:34.658
if I implicated him...

41:35.100 --> 41:36.672
He threatened you.

41:44.295 --> 41:46.077
It's okay.

41:47.800 --> 41:49.704
You're safe now.

41:49.734 --> 41:51.336
Allison...

41:52.237 --> 41:53.710
what are you going to do now?

41:53.780 --> 41:55.312
I'll be okay.

41:56.234 --> 41:58.577
It's not like when I was a kid.

41:58.677 --> 42:01.292
I can pretty much get anything
I need off the internet.

42:01.392 --> 42:03.817
And you're set with money?

42:03.907 --> 42:05.709
I'll manage.

42:06.020 --> 42:07.883
Allison

42:08.073 --> 42:09.416
I have every confidence

42:09.505 --> 42:12.501
that you're going to be
just fine here, but...

42:12.844 --> 42:17.014
if you ever need anything,
would you please give me a call?

42:17.064 --> 42:19.994
I
- I will, ms. Willows.

42:20.074 --> 42:21.115
Catherine.

42:21.724 --> 42:23.278
Catherine...

42:24.924 --> 42:28.894
I haven't been completely
honest with you.

42:30.264 --> 42:32.983
I told you my mother was dead,

42:33.014 --> 42:34.644
but that's not true.

42:34.903 --> 42:36.754
I'm not sure I follow.

42:36.944 --> 42:40.274
Hayden told me she was in a car wreck

42:40.363 --> 42:44.974
and I called the funeral
home to send flowers.

42:45.123 --> 42:46.754
They had never heard of her,

42:46.764 --> 42:52.533
so I called the local
hospitals, same thing.

42:52.563 --> 42:57.913
Recently, I contacted
peopledetectors.com

42:58.264 --> 42:59.613
and, apparently,

42:59.734 --> 43:02.263
she lives in Las Vegas.

43:04.703 --> 43:08.143
She just couldn't live with me.

43:10.053 --> 43:13.953
So you were the one that
contacted peopledetectors.

43:14.023 --> 43:15.433
Yeah.

43:15.623 --> 43:19.871
When my brother was
out, I used his computer.
