***

00:03.160 --> 00:05.778
You agree not to prosecute Kate,
I'll tell you where she is.

00:05.817 --> 00:07.484
Could we use the Crawford girl?

00:07.509 --> 00:08.841
Put her on the inside.

00:08.866 --> 00:10.095
She has relatives in Prague.

00:10.108 --> 00:12.195
An uncle. Tamir Zakayev.

00:12.220 --> 00:14.211
In return for new life in London,

00:14.236 --> 00:16.332
you find out from Doku
where the General is.

00:16.358 --> 00:17.429
Spy on my husband?

00:17.735 --> 00:19.094
Maybe this is the gun

00:19.119 --> 00:20.499
that Dmitry used to kill Jaros.

00:20.523 --> 00:21.523
Maybe not.

00:21.548 --> 00:23.634
We just need evidence to squeeze him.

00:23.848 --> 00:25.309
I'm looking...

00:25.334 --> 00:26.714
for Dmitry Petrovich.

00:26.739 --> 00:28.436
They say he went to Paris to find her.

00:28.461 --> 00:30.354
Her?

Of course, <i>ch√©ri.</i>

00:45.713 --> 00:46.912
Get in.

00:48.084 --> 00:49.826
How long does that buy me?

00:50.001 --> 00:50.966
Mm...

00:51.002 --> 00:52.350
two hours.

00:52.375 --> 00:53.374
All right.

00:53.399 --> 00:56.508
If I need longer, I'll pay you more.

01:06.491 --> 01:07.768
What's he saying?

01:09.047 --> 01:10.797
Something about a robbery.

01:10.822 --> 01:12.521
All right, keep listening.

01:13.719 --> 01:15.403
If there's any mention of the girl

01:15.428 --> 01:16.516
who did the shooting yesterday

01:16.541 --> 01:18.711
or a man in his 50s who was with her,

01:18.736 --> 01:20.599
you let me know.

01:26.766 --> 01:27.944
Hey!

01:27.969 --> 01:30.052
Can I get some food in here?!

01:33.389 --> 01:36.156
You carried Ifti's bag
through security in London.

01:36.213 --> 01:38.013
I told you already.

01:38.049 --> 01:39.631
I didn't know there was a gun in it.

01:39.683 --> 01:40.966
It doesn't matter.

01:41.002 --> 01:43.297
You're still an accessory to mass murder.

01:43.322 --> 01:44.533
But if you want us to keep you

01:44.558 --> 01:46.189
out of the hands of the French,

01:46.674 --> 01:48.124
you need to cooperate.

01:48.149 --> 01:50.679
What do you mean "cooperate"?

02:07.738 --> 02:09.687
Kate!

02:10.830 --> 02:12.319
Papa?!

02:12.826 --> 02:14.181
Stop! Kate!

02:14.206 --> 02:15.539
You okay?!

02:15.564 --> 02:17.806
Get me out of here!

02:19.276 --> 02:21.022
Kate!

02:21.873 --> 02:23.285
Don't tell them anything!

02:23.310 --> 02:24.977
Don't agree to anything!

02:25.012 --> 02:26.061
Do you hear me?!

02:26.097 --> 02:28.501
Don't say a word!

02:34.036 --> 02:36.736
I'm done talking to you.

02:46.337 --> 02:47.870
Pull up a chair.

02:49.137 --> 02:50.897
So...

02:51.324 --> 02:53.567
what's all this about?

02:56.353 --> 02:59.320
Ah, the old coded message.

02:59.345 --> 03:01.441
That was Doku earlier today.

03:04.614 --> 03:06.973
That was Friday.

03:09.066 --> 03:11.033
And that was last Tuesday.

03:11.058 --> 03:13.716
We tailed Doku leaving the
mosque today after prayers.

03:13.741 --> 03:14.829
He came straight home.

03:14.854 --> 03:17.571
So he's getting the messages
from someone at the mosque.

03:20.803 --> 03:23.771
I think it's time we gave our new friend

03:23.796 --> 03:25.796
her first task.

03:49.155 --> 03:50.454
You live here?

03:50.490 --> 03:51.822
I rent.

03:52.753 --> 03:55.054
So we have place to meet.

03:58.202 --> 04:00.013
Looking for something?

04:01.085 --> 04:02.750
You have tea?

04:02.802 --> 04:04.410
Coffee?

04:12.762 --> 04:14.762
I am Russian.

04:17.767 --> 04:22.186
Someone at mosque is passing
your husband messages.

04:22.238 --> 04:24.405
From the general?

04:24.440 --> 04:25.990
Perhaps.

04:26.025 --> 04:27.742
You must go to mosque with him,

04:27.777 --> 04:30.175
see who messenger is.

04:31.180 --> 04:34.379
What if Doku sees me watching him?

04:35.010 --> 04:37.228
Wife cannot look at her husband?

04:37.253 --> 04:39.672
You love him. You smile.

04:41.874 --> 04:44.459
I did love him.

04:44.684 --> 04:46.600
Once.

04:48.245 --> 04:51.246
But now you must think about Katya.

05:03.885 --> 05:05.193
Remember,

05:05.218 --> 05:07.448
buy groceries downstairs.

05:07.483 --> 05:09.784
He needs to think you went shopping, yes?

05:09.819 --> 05:12.819
I am good little Muslim wife.

05:12.925 --> 05:15.299
How could I forget?

05:19.566 --> 05:21.833
<i>Could I come to mosque tomorrow,</i>

05:22.238 --> 05:24.572
to pray with you?

05:25.361 --> 05:28.495
That would make me very happy.

06:09.754 --> 06:13.794
Petrovich, we have a warrant
to search the premises.

06:21.391 --> 06:23.140
You want drink?

06:23.192 --> 06:24.624
No, thank you.

06:24.649 --> 06:26.120
What about you?

06:26.145 --> 06:27.274
Or maybe

06:27.313 --> 06:29.173
lap dance.

06:29.198 --> 06:30.744
Something special

06:30.769 --> 06:33.832
for important man from FBI.

06:36.072 --> 06:38.956
Detective Miskova.

06:40.159 --> 06:41.876
Mr. Petrovich,

06:41.911 --> 06:43.661
do you have a license for this firearm?

06:43.686 --> 06:45.368
Is not my gun.

06:55.163 --> 06:57.887
_

06:57.904 --> 06:59.451
<i>Mmm.</i>

06:59.580 --> 07:01.163
Delicious, darling, thank you.

07:01.188 --> 07:02.937
I'm so glad you enjoyed it.

07:07.806 --> 07:10.557
Well, I'd best be off, then.

07:10.582 --> 07:12.882
You're going to London tonight?

07:12.918 --> 07:14.750
Uh, meetings first thing.

07:14.775 --> 07:16.416
I'll stay at my club.

07:41.772 --> 07:43.405
I missed you.

07:50.455 --> 07:53.122
Oh, Terrence.

07:54.144 --> 07:56.953
_

07:57.012 --> 07:59.584
<i>Lady Anna.</i>

07:59.609 --> 08:01.204
Hmm?

08:01.229 --> 08:03.252
What's it about?

08:04.113 --> 08:06.329
Well...

08:06.354 --> 08:07.540
so far,

08:07.565 --> 08:09.416
a young woman of noble birth

08:09.441 --> 08:10.951
has fallen in love with a tailor.

08:10.976 --> 08:12.355
Her family is appalled

08:12.380 --> 08:14.408
and tries to ruin the relationship.

08:14.433 --> 08:17.538
Will society divide them,
and it will be a tragedy?

08:17.649 --> 08:20.482
Or will love win out,
and it will be a comedy?

08:20.507 --> 08:23.217
I suppose I shall have
to read on and find out.

08:23.432 --> 08:25.015
Ernst.

08:25.040 --> 08:26.740
Terrence.

08:33.976 --> 08:35.441
Yes?

08:35.523 --> 08:37.659
Okay, yes.

08:47.512 --> 08:50.146
Well, it was a pleasure to meet you.

08:59.524 --> 09:01.379
What's the big emergency?

09:01.404 --> 09:03.220
Dmitry's been arrested, sir.

09:03.245 --> 09:04.711
Damn it.

09:04.736 --> 09:05.934
Take my fingerprints.

09:05.959 --> 09:07.797
I tell you, they are not on gun.

09:07.822 --> 09:10.117
A man like you, Petrovich,
I bet you take good care

09:10.142 --> 09:11.542
of the tools of the trade.

09:11.567 --> 09:13.483
You keep that gun clean,

09:13.508 --> 09:15.358
wipe it down after every hit.

09:15.383 --> 09:18.885
Because what self-respecting
murdering scumbag does any less?

09:18.984 --> 09:21.785
You'll go to prison for 20 years.

09:21.810 --> 09:23.310
Or you can cooperate.

09:23.335 --> 09:25.205
Tell us all about your Russian mob buddy

09:25.230 --> 09:26.443
Viktor Luhanski.

09:26.468 --> 09:27.467
In return, we grant you

09:27.492 --> 09:29.992
full immunity from prosecution.

09:30.017 --> 09:32.651
You hear of Butyrka prison?

09:33.993 --> 09:35.993
Toughest prison in Russia.

09:36.018 --> 09:38.039
I am five years there.

09:38.064 --> 09:41.461
Compared to that, Czech
prison is like Four Seasons.

09:42.853 --> 09:44.229
Go ahead.

09:44.254 --> 09:45.333
Lock me up.

09:45.358 --> 09:47.221
I could use vacation.

09:48.133 --> 09:51.217
You Russian gangsters...

09:51.242 --> 09:54.092
You talk a big game, but
when it comes down to it,

09:54.117 --> 09:57.134
you're all as gutless
as schoolyard bullies.

10:00.091 --> 10:02.860
You're finished, Petrovich.

10:02.885 --> 10:04.218
Done.

10:04.243 --> 10:05.970
We got you.

10:08.700 --> 10:10.300
Let's dance.

10:11.574 --> 10:13.853
We're supposed to be celebrating.

10:13.878 --> 10:15.780
We got our guy.

10:28.008 --> 10:30.426
Tamir planted that gun.

10:30.451 --> 10:32.718
You know that, don't you?

10:32.743 --> 10:35.527
You think about work all the time.

10:35.857 --> 10:37.838
You need to relax.

10:41.954 --> 10:44.843
The way you handled Petrovich...

10:44.890 --> 10:47.276
Many cops would've been intimidated.

10:47.301 --> 10:50.587
But... you,

10:50.612 --> 10:52.779
you were so calm.

10:52.804 --> 10:54.470
So strong.

10:56.188 --> 10:58.345
It was very...

10:58.370 --> 11:00.402
impressive.

11:01.518 --> 11:04.018
Let's get out of here.

11:12.897 --> 11:14.505
It's, um...

11:14.530 --> 11:17.146
it's late and, uh, I should...

11:17.723 --> 11:19.472
I should go.

11:19.497 --> 11:21.993
Besides, we have round two
with Dmitry in the morning.

11:22.046 --> 11:24.358
So, um...

11:26.161 --> 11:28.161
Thanks for the dance.

11:50.189 --> 11:53.299

11:57.185 --> 11:59.289

11:59.314 --> 12:00.814
<i>He's saying that all detectives</i>

12:00.839 --> 12:02.680
and, uh, how do you say,

12:02.705 --> 12:04.705
<i>enqueteurs de scene de crime.</i>

12:04.730 --> 12:06.279
Inquisitors of crime scene.

12:06.304 --> 12:07.486
Investigators?

12:07.511 --> 12:08.877
- Like CSI?
- Mm.

12:08.902 --> 12:10.249
They're all being told to go

12:10.274 --> 12:12.441
to 52 Rue St. Louis, immediately.

12:12.814 --> 12:15.046
All right, what's he saying now?

12:15.071 --> 12:16.604
Uh, well, uh, they think

12:16.629 --> 12:18.993
it's where the terrorist girl was hiding.

12:19.233 --> 12:22.869
They say she and the man
broke into an empty apartment

12:22.894 --> 12:24.708
- that was for sale.
- The man?

12:24.733 --> 12:26.097
The man was with her?

12:26.122 --> 12:27.369
Yes, the man.

12:27.394 --> 12:28.595
And they're warning that

12:28.620 --> 12:30.286
both of them may be armed and dangerous.

12:32.185 --> 12:33.646
Hey!

12:33.671 --> 12:36.447
Excuse me, have you seen this man?

12:36.472 --> 12:37.831
Uh, have you seen this man?

12:37.856 --> 12:39.171
No, monsieur.

12:40.312 --> 12:41.595
Uh, excuse me.

12:41.620 --> 12:43.653
Uh, have you seen this man?

12:45.154 --> 12:47.142
You saw this man here?

12:47.168 --> 12:48.919
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Who the hell are you?

12:48.944 --> 12:51.671
Special Agent Ballard, FBI.

12:51.696 --> 12:53.939
All right, this witness
says he saw this man here.

12:53.964 --> 12:56.282
Now, what are these witnesses saying?

12:56.307 --> 12:58.315
He's a priority Bureau target.

12:58.340 --> 13:01.375
All right.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.496
This morning, six men took the girl,

13:06.521 --> 13:08.604
forced her into a Range Rover,

13:08.629 --> 13:10.032
drove away at high speed.

13:10.057 --> 13:12.307
Some witnesses heard
them speaking... English.

13:12.332 --> 13:14.047
What about the man who was with her?

13:14.072 --> 13:16.519
The man with same description
was forced into a car

13:16.544 --> 13:18.293
in Place Des Vosges last night.

13:18.509 --> 13:20.176
Also a Range Rover?

13:20.201 --> 13:22.847
Driven at high speeds by men
who were speaking English?

13:22.872 --> 13:23.806
<i>Exactement.</i>

13:23.831 --> 13:25.382

Ballard.

13:30.295 --> 13:31.761
I'm just wondering.

13:31.796 --> 13:33.328
You located Martin Odum?

13:33.439 --> 13:35.128
I told you to stay out of it.

13:35.153 --> 13:36.456
I know where he is.

13:36.801 --> 13:38.517
Where? Where is he?

13:38.553 --> 13:39.408
Well, I'll tell you.

13:39.433 --> 13:41.074
Provided you get me authorization

13:41.099 --> 13:43.504
to make the arrest.

15:11.430 --> 15:13.566
_

15:13.591 --> 15:16.631
_

15:16.656 --> 15:18.245
_

15:18.389 --> 15:19.884
_

15:19.909 --> 15:22.285
_

15:34.538 --> 15:38.827
Your friend Petrovich is
under arrest for murder.

15:39.040 --> 15:41.035
Who do they say he killed?

15:41.060 --> 15:42.923
Someone called Jaros.

15:42.947 --> 15:46.020
Police found the gun in his desk.

15:49.521 --> 15:52.451
This Petrovich is
important to you, isn't he?

15:53.280 --> 15:54.947
What do you want from me?

15:56.880 --> 16:00.952
I want $50,000 for me to
make the charges go away.

16:00.977 --> 16:04.478
Or you can let him rot in jail,
but who knows what he might say

16:04.503 --> 16:06.587
to avoid a long sentence?

16:07.995 --> 16:10.329
I'll get you the money.

16:26.397 --> 16:28.684
Why? Why? What did I do?

16:28.709 --> 16:31.433
You took my gun and you put
in Dmitry's desk, didn't you?

16:31.458 --> 16:33.591
- Hmm?
- What? Are you crazy...

16:33.616 --> 16:35.079
Okay! I did.

16:35.104 --> 16:36.752
I did!

16:41.028 --> 16:44.112
Police question me and
they say maybe I kill him

16:44.137 --> 16:44.782
or you did.

16:44.807 --> 16:46.135
I'm protecting you, brother!

16:46.160 --> 16:48.027
We need Dmitry!

16:48.085 --> 16:49.418
His trucks!

16:49.546 --> 16:51.538
His connections at border!

16:51.563 --> 16:53.563
Are you stupid?!

16:55.473 --> 16:57.807
What do you mean they released him?

16:57.832 --> 16:59.832
There was a problem with the warrant.

16:59.891 --> 17:01.391
Legal technicality.

17:01.416 --> 17:03.348
Oh, you mean Dmitry's mob bosses

17:03.373 --> 17:04.603
put their hands into their pockets?

17:04.627 --> 17:06.045
Who did they pay off?

17:06.069 --> 17:07.271
The chief of police?

17:07.297 --> 17:08.329
The Minister of Justice?

17:08.354 --> 17:09.348
Maybe they paid off you.

17:09.374 --> 17:10.857
Curtis.

17:13.821 --> 17:16.223
_

17:20.844 --> 17:23.376
_

17:24.191 --> 17:26.489
<i>We're running out of time.</i>

17:27.796 --> 17:30.246
She's been gone what, two days now?

17:30.271 --> 17:31.816
How are we gonna credibly account for that?

17:31.851 --> 17:33.168
Calm down, darling.

17:33.193 --> 17:34.739
I'll break her.

17:44.716 --> 17:46.466
Maybe it's time to talk to Papa.

18:03.383 --> 18:04.988
Two months ago,

18:05.013 --> 18:07.208
Six began an op in Prague.

18:07.233 --> 18:10.468
Some Chechen extremists caught their eye.

18:10.493 --> 18:13.114
They zeroed in on one man in particular.

18:13.669 --> 18:15.978
Tamir Zakayev.

18:16.003 --> 18:17.422
They think he's planning something big

18:17.447 --> 18:18.780
for the NATO/Russian summit.

18:18.815 --> 18:20.639
Why you telling me all this?

18:20.664 --> 18:23.082
They caught one of his
guys using a dead-drop.

18:23.107 --> 18:24.909
They cleared it, found a memory card,

18:24.934 --> 18:26.670
copied it, put it back.

18:28.597 --> 18:30.134
Encrypted.

18:30.159 --> 18:31.742
High-level Rijndael.

18:31.767 --> 18:33.150
Unbreakable.

18:33.382 --> 18:35.284
Before Kate went to Paris,

18:35.309 --> 18:39.144
she was befriended by this
young woman in London.

18:39.252 --> 18:40.944
Khava Bazaeva.

18:40.969 --> 18:44.572
Turns out, Khava is a terrorist recruiter.

18:44.597 --> 18:47.305
And she offered to put Kate
in touch with Tamir Zakayev.

18:47.578 --> 18:50.048
Well, Kate's an international fugitive.

18:50.073 --> 18:52.087
And this Tamir character,

18:52.112 --> 18:54.146
he wouldn't want anything
to do with her now.

18:54.171 --> 18:56.204
Tamir is Kate's uncle.

18:59.489 --> 19:03.274
If we're lucky, Zakayev
takes her in with open arms.

19:03.326 --> 19:05.576
His long-lost niece.

19:05.612 --> 19:06.665
The daughter of

19:06.690 --> 19:11.427
his heroic dead brother Doku.

19:18.468 --> 19:20.268
Kate goes in,

19:20.293 --> 19:22.579
she downloads Zakayev's computer,

19:22.604 --> 19:24.404
and then she comes out.

19:24.429 --> 19:27.258
She does this, and we'll
talk sense into the French.

19:27.717 --> 19:30.414
We need you to get her to play ball.

19:30.637 --> 19:32.637
Nah.

19:32.662 --> 19:34.662
She's just a kid. She's innocent.

19:34.724 --> 19:35.888
Any lawyer

19:35.913 --> 19:37.585
would convince a jury she never knowingly

19:37.610 --> 19:39.193
went through security with a gun.

19:39.229 --> 19:40.485
If you really believed that,

19:40.510 --> 19:41.956
you would've called a lawyer.

19:41.981 --> 19:43.719
But you didn't, did you?

19:43.744 --> 19:45.911
You called me.

19:56.206 --> 19:58.123
I just got off a conference call

19:58.148 --> 20:00.682
with the director of the
FBI and the head of Six.

20:00.707 --> 20:02.707
I've been ordered to hand
over Odum to the FBI.

20:02.732 --> 20:03.660
Jesus, how'd they know we had him?

20:03.685 --> 20:04.708
Who cares?

20:04.733 --> 20:06.980
The FBI are threatening a
major diplomatic incident

20:07.005 --> 20:09.323
- unless I hand him over immediately.
- You can't!

20:09.348 --> 20:11.077
Do you think I want to go
down in history as the man

20:11.101 --> 20:13.289
who broke up this special relationship?

20:13.314 --> 20:15.433
It wouldn't look so bloody hot on my CV.

20:44.078 --> 20:46.278
Remember me?

20:51.399 --> 20:53.986
_

20:54.130 --> 20:55.210
- _ 
- <i>Nina,</i>

20:55.235 --> 20:57.756
- _
- <i>I'm guessing this is not a social call.</i>

20:57.829 --> 20:59.138
There's been a lot of chatter

20:59.163 --> 21:00.807
about the summit next week in Prague.

21:00.832 --> 21:01.722
The usual threats.

21:01.747 --> 21:03.476
No surprise.

21:03.501 --> 21:07.369
Well, we've isolated something
specific and credible.

21:07.616 --> 21:09.878
We've been running a joint op with Six.

21:10.006 --> 21:12.174
The FBI butted in...

21:12.199 --> 21:13.398
Uh, let me guess.

21:13.423 --> 21:16.174
They did what they do best.

21:17.406 --> 21:19.523
I need your help cleaning it up.

21:28.021 --> 21:30.540
You asked me before if I remember you.

21:30.565 --> 21:32.671
Truth is I don't.

21:32.820 --> 21:36.286
I don't remember you, I
don't remember my own family.

21:36.311 --> 21:38.870
I don't even remember m-my real name.

21:38.895 --> 21:40.717
You're claiming amnesia?

21:40.742 --> 21:42.479
Seriously?

21:42.908 --> 21:45.543
That is pathetic.

21:46.186 --> 21:47.902
Who did you know me as?

21:47.927 --> 21:49.022
Dmitry?

21:49.047 --> 21:50.758
Eh, Dmitry...

21:50.783 --> 21:52.615
Martin Odum...

21:52.640 --> 21:54.065
John Cameron.

21:54.090 --> 21:55.656
Who cares what you called yourself?

21:55.681 --> 21:57.427
But who was I?

21:57.682 --> 22:00.310
You were the biggest
piece of shit I ever met.

22:00.544 --> 22:03.128
You smuggled drugs and guns.

22:03.153 --> 22:04.619
You beat up innocent people.

22:04.644 --> 22:07.711
You were a gangster, a murderer.

22:07.736 --> 22:10.320
You crippled me.

22:12.478 --> 22:14.228
That was Dmitry.

22:15.527 --> 22:17.359
No, buddy...

22:17.385 --> 22:19.352
it was you.

22:26.128 --> 22:27.927
_

22:27.952 --> 22:29.066
<i>Daddy!</i>

22:29.091 --> 22:30.604
Hey.

22:30.629 --> 22:31.755
Come here.

22:31.780 --> 22:33.905
Oh!

22:35.720 --> 22:36.969
What's this?

22:36.994 --> 22:38.409
A man dropped it by earlier.

22:43.291 --> 22:45.216
Is everything all right?

22:46.047 --> 22:47.714
Yeah, fine. Uh...

22:47.859 --> 22:49.358
I have to go to London.

22:49.383 --> 22:50.549
Now?

22:50.574 --> 22:52.207
You just got home.

22:52.232 --> 22:53.336
Can't it wait till the morning?

22:53.361 --> 22:55.240
No, it bloody well can't.

23:03.414 --> 23:04.746
What the hell?!

23:04.771 --> 23:05.830
Don't touch me!

23:05.855 --> 23:07.355
Get out!

23:08.635 --> 23:10.702
Get out!

23:13.307 --> 23:16.091
How much did they pay you to seduce me?

23:16.537 --> 23:18.654
What are you talking about?

23:31.069 --> 23:33.616
How much, Angelo?

23:35.145 --> 23:36.761
How much?!

23:38.985 --> 23:40.773
500 quid!

23:46.920 --> 23:49.130
I loved you.

23:56.593 --> 23:58.694
_

23:58.719 --> 24:00.510
<i>Pretty sure Tamir set you up.</i>

24:00.535 --> 24:01.651
But why frame me?

24:01.676 --> 24:03.137
Are they trying to get me out of the way?

24:03.163 --> 24:05.880
I think Tamir just panicked,
tried to save his own skin.

24:05.905 --> 24:07.541
Or maybe Doku put him up to it.

24:07.566 --> 24:08.948
I don't think so.

24:08.973 --> 24:10.556
Doku needs you.

24:10.784 --> 24:11.995
Your cover's intact.

24:12.020 --> 24:13.303
Maybe.

24:13.328 --> 24:15.338
Maybe, but Doku and Tamir need to know

24:15.363 --> 24:17.003
that I know they set me up.

24:17.028 --> 24:19.208
Out of the question.

24:19.233 --> 24:20.366
Terrence,

24:20.391 --> 24:22.801
if I don't kill whichever
one of them did it,

24:22.826 --> 24:23.888
then my cover is blown,

24:23.913 --> 24:25.689
and I'm gonna end up with
a bullet in my brain.

24:25.714 --> 24:27.224
You seem to keep forgetting this,

24:27.250 --> 24:29.289
so let me get it through your thick skull.

24:29.313 --> 24:31.799
You are not a Russian gangster.

24:31.824 --> 24:34.441
You are an intelligence officer.

24:34.466 --> 24:35.684
You work for me,

24:35.709 --> 24:37.425
and you will remember that your life

24:37.450 --> 24:39.254
is at all times, my dear boy,

24:39.279 --> 24:41.684
entirely in my hands.

24:41.906 --> 24:43.798
Now, pull yourself together.

24:43.823 --> 24:44.905
Or what?

24:44.930 --> 24:46.219
You gonna pull me out?

24:46.244 --> 24:47.406
Send me home, will you?

24:47.430 --> 24:49.063
Go ahead, do it.

24:49.089 --> 24:50.805
There's no going home.

24:51.522 --> 24:53.562
Not for you

24:53.587 --> 24:55.496
and not for me.

24:55.521 --> 24:58.022
Ever.

25:01.382 --> 25:03.523
I may not be a gangster,

25:04.499 --> 25:07.465
but Doku thinks I am.

25:10.107 --> 25:12.262
Allahu Akbar.

25:12.287 --> 25:13.841
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

25:57.570 --> 26:01.109
_

26:14.643 --> 26:16.882
Plane's ten minutes out.

26:22.343 --> 26:24.788
I don't know what I did as Dmitry,

26:24.889 --> 26:26.946
but what I do know is

26:27.229 --> 26:29.793
I didn't kill the director of the FBI.

26:31.142 --> 26:32.440
Tell it to a jury.

26:32.465 --> 26:35.080
Ah, we both know I'll
never get a fair trial.

26:35.207 --> 26:37.958
You deserve justice for what you've done.

26:39.810 --> 26:41.807
Putting me on that plane,

26:41.938 --> 26:43.918
sending me back for a crime I didn't commit

26:43.943 --> 26:47.194
and that I'll be executed
for... How is that justice?

26:47.219 --> 26:49.503
What's the FBI motto?

26:49.992 --> 26:52.757
"Fidelity, Bravery, Integrity."

26:55.697 --> 26:57.397
And that you remember.

26:57.422 --> 26:59.271
Here we are in the middle of nowhere,

26:59.511 --> 27:01.719
sending me back to face charges.

27:01.755 --> 27:03.627
But where are the extradition papers?

27:03.652 --> 27:05.494
Not legal, this, what you're doing.

27:05.519 --> 27:07.792
Truth is, mate, you're a hypocrite.

27:09.187 --> 27:11.311
Get your hands off me.

27:11.917 --> 27:13.883
You don't know who I am!

27:14.014 --> 27:15.681
All right, you don't know
what I've done to get here,

27:15.706 --> 27:17.032
to find you, to bring you in!

27:17.056 --> 27:18.406
You're right.

27:19.488 --> 27:21.639
And I don't give a shit either.

27:22.887 --> 27:24.331
Agent Ballard.

27:24.356 --> 27:26.376
What?

27:34.669 --> 27:36.775
Special Agent Curtis Ballard?

27:36.800 --> 27:38.831
Yes?

27:38.856 --> 27:40.535
What the hell is this?

27:40.560 --> 27:42.193
It's a directive,

27:42.244 --> 27:44.407
signed by the DNI and the AG,

27:44.432 --> 27:46.982
instructing you to turn
over Martin Odum to me.

27:49.566 --> 27:51.627
This man is wanted for murder.

27:51.652 --> 27:52.764
Call Fiske.

27:52.789 --> 27:55.478
Bring it up with him.

27:55.615 --> 27:56.581
Hey!

27:56.798 --> 27:58.370
You don't understand.

27:58.395 --> 28:00.028
I've been hunting him for 14 years!

28:00.786 --> 28:02.646
I'm sorry.

28:02.671 --> 28:05.024
This goes above both our heads.

28:21.048 --> 28:23.719
I suppose I should thank you.

28:23.744 --> 28:26.695
Suppose so.

28:27.290 --> 28:29.853
I'll help you with Kate on two conditions.

28:29.878 --> 28:31.974
Martin, you are in no
position to negotiate...

28:31.999 --> 28:33.358
I run her.

28:33.383 --> 28:36.008
I'm her handler, nobody else.

28:36.033 --> 28:38.417
Second, you get Six to let me see

28:38.442 --> 28:40.087
all the files about who I am...

28:40.112 --> 28:42.798
Dmitry, John Cameron, all the legends.

28:49.278 --> 28:51.579
_

29:01.737 --> 29:04.319
Which one of you put gun in my desk?

29:04.344 --> 29:06.705
W-What gun?

29:07.061 --> 29:08.976
It was you, wasn't it?

29:09.001 --> 29:10.601
Yes, it was him.

29:11.400 --> 29:13.639
I have right to kill him.

29:13.664 --> 29:15.522
Yes, you do.

29:16.305 --> 29:18.994
But I paid to get you out of jail.

29:21.416 --> 29:23.967
So you let him go.

29:34.029 --> 29:36.413
Enough!

29:37.923 --> 29:40.541
<i>Doku said he paid to get me out.</i>

29:40.718 --> 29:43.791
Well, either he was lying
to protect his brother,

29:43.965 --> 29:45.868
or maybe...

29:45.920 --> 29:48.990
we were right to keep
this whole op a secret.

29:49.377 --> 29:52.593
Can't trust the Czech police or the FBI.

29:54.962 --> 29:57.932
Hey, you might want to
get that hand looked at.

29:58.449 --> 30:01.369
You never know when you'll
need to punch him again.

30:01.682 --> 30:03.715
<i>What if we never catch him?</i>

30:03.740 --> 30:06.008
I don't know.

30:06.932 --> 30:09.733
Maybe bad guys and lovers are the same.

30:09.811 --> 30:11.417
What do you mean?

30:11.442 --> 30:13.854
There's always one that gets away.

30:14.903 --> 30:17.904
You just have to learn to live with that.

30:21.862 --> 30:25.581
Um... I owe you an apology.

30:25.606 --> 30:27.316
Uh...

30:27.341 --> 30:29.828
Running out on you at
the bar last night was...

30:29.854 --> 30:31.931
Oh, my God, I was so drunk.

30:33.220 --> 30:35.962
It's a good thing you're a gentleman.

30:35.987 --> 30:38.802
Didn't take advantage of me.

30:42.180 --> 30:45.765
What if I were gentlemanly about it?

30:45.982 --> 30:48.066
What do you mean?

30:48.091 --> 30:50.734
Would you like to have
dinner with me sometime?

30:51.507 --> 30:52.875
You know,

30:52.900 --> 30:55.525
like, uh, a real date.

30:59.247 --> 31:02.331
You're, um, a great guy, Curtis.

31:02.530 --> 31:04.242
The kind of man

31:04.267 --> 31:05.610
I should be with.

31:05.870 --> 31:07.170
But I...

31:07.195 --> 31:08.494
Uh, right, we work together.

31:08.540 --> 31:10.376
It's better to keep things simple.

31:10.401 --> 31:12.234
You're right. I'm sorry.

31:31.804 --> 31:34.488
Old Czech saying.

31:34.513 --> 31:37.217
"Patience brings roses."

31:42.028 --> 31:44.227
We'll get him.

31:50.029 --> 31:52.936
_

32:00.508 --> 32:03.235
Oh, man, you again?

32:46.260 --> 32:47.927
Yeah?

32:47.952 --> 32:49.952
Curtis? Fiske.

32:50.138 --> 32:51.971
We were trumped on Odum.

32:52.023 --> 32:53.729
Goddamn agency called in the big dogs.

32:53.754 --> 32:55.055
I don't know what else to say.

32:55.222 --> 32:56.665
All that aside,

32:56.690 --> 33:00.252
what you did finding Odum,
that was excellent work.

33:00.277 --> 33:02.995
Got me thinking... An
opportunity's come up,

33:03.020 --> 33:06.021
something I think you'd be perfect for.

33:06.046 --> 33:08.880
Uh, back in the field?

33:08.905 --> 33:10.738
Quantico.

33:10.763 --> 33:12.118
I hear they're looking for someone

33:12.143 --> 33:13.357
to teach a class on cooperation

33:13.383 --> 33:15.616
between international
law enforcement agencies.

33:15.671 --> 33:17.037
With all your experience,

33:17.062 --> 33:18.869
I think you'd make a great teacher.

33:21.314 --> 33:24.315
Uh, "those who can't," right?

33:33.748 --> 33:36.628
_

33:53.348 --> 33:56.482
You know how old your friend Angelo is?

34:01.429 --> 34:03.262
Seventeen.

34:03.297 --> 34:05.504
Your career, your family,

34:05.529 --> 34:07.143
your whole life,

34:07.785 --> 34:09.784
all gone.

34:15.504 --> 34:18.388
This is a no smoking compartment.

34:22.150 --> 34:25.150
Order of battle at MI6.

34:25.187 --> 34:27.103
Names of department heads,

34:27.129 --> 34:29.804
section heads, personal details,

34:29.829 --> 34:32.668
sexual preferences, vulnerabilities.

34:32.889 --> 34:34.393
Friday.

34:34.418 --> 34:36.228
White Hart at Waterloo.

34:36.937 --> 34:39.271
7:00.

35:10.017 --> 35:11.189
Daddy?

35:12.205 --> 35:14.851
Daddy, I can't sleep.

35:16.838 --> 35:18.838
Come here.

35:19.579 --> 35:22.288
I had a bad dream.

35:24.236 --> 35:26.236
Me, too.

35:26.539 --> 35:28.941
I love you, Daddy.

35:40.478 --> 35:41.880
Come on.

35:45.128 --> 35:47.462
G and T, please.

35:54.218 --> 35:56.218
You stay with your wife.

35:56.505 --> 35:59.437
You carry on as before.

36:00.032 --> 36:04.100
But if Six were to discover
your... proclivities,

36:04.125 --> 36:06.107
your career would be over.

36:06.136 --> 36:08.636
And we can't have that.

36:08.672 --> 36:11.973
So no more... perversions.

36:23.054 --> 36:25.023
_

36:34.450 --> 36:36.808
Hello, comrade.

36:37.285 --> 36:38.991
Don't call me that.

36:43.953 --> 36:46.621
Any news on General Arsanov?

36:47.544 --> 36:49.672
Is Six getting impatient?

36:49.697 --> 36:51.379
Moscow is.

36:51.404 --> 36:53.435
We're making progress.

36:53.460 --> 36:56.240
What are Six's instructions

36:56.265 --> 36:57.245
when you find him?

36:57.297 --> 36:59.247
They want the matter closed.

37:03.681 --> 37:06.037
We want it left open.

37:10.206 --> 37:13.234
<i>So did it turn out to be a tragedy</i>

37:13.259 --> 37:15.259
or a comedy?

37:16.767 --> 37:18.733
Well...

37:18.769 --> 37:21.736
Lady Anna defies her family,

37:21.772 --> 37:25.690
abandons society, forsakes her inheritance.

37:25.742 --> 37:28.577
She runs off to Australia with her tailor.

37:28.612 --> 37:30.745
To live happily ever after.

37:33.354 --> 37:34.863
May I join you?

37:34.887 --> 37:36.303
Please.

37:41.184 --> 37:43.101
You like champagne?

37:43.126 --> 37:45.025
What are we celebrating?

37:57.608 --> 37:59.815
I'm sorry...

38:01.284 --> 38:04.285
uh, but I think you have
the wrong idea about me.

38:19.807 --> 38:22.808
<i>I saw a man pass Doku a
message at the mosque.</i>

38:22.833 --> 38:26.134
I don't know his name, but I
believe he works at Najab's,

38:26.169 --> 38:28.133
the halal butcher on Finska Street.

38:28.158 --> 38:29.772
You've done well.

38:31.863 --> 38:33.558
What happened?

38:33.594 --> 38:35.093
Nothing.

38:35.145 --> 38:36.728
Show me.

39:10.523 --> 39:12.356
Katya is waiting.

39:17.052 --> 39:18.985
Your scarf.

39:28.456 --> 39:30.321
_

39:30.346 --> 39:31.733
<i>Kate?</i>

39:31.758 --> 39:33.508
Kate?

39:35.492 --> 39:37.992
Papa.

39:41.123 --> 39:43.241
I can't do what they want.

39:43.266 --> 39:45.269
Yes, you can. You have to.

39:45.522 --> 39:47.525
We have to.

39:47.550 --> 39:49.716
It's our only option.

39:50.193 --> 39:52.397
It's okay.

39:52.422 --> 39:54.732
I told you I'm gonna see you through this,

39:54.757 --> 39:56.724
all the way.

40:10.110 --> 40:11.943
Curtis?

40:12.098 --> 40:13.918
I once asked you:

40:14.467 --> 40:17.518
what if we never caught Dmitry?

40:18.376 --> 40:20.343
You remember what you said?

40:20.368 --> 40:22.257
You said,

40:23.143 --> 40:26.374
"There's always one that gets away,

40:26.532 --> 40:29.365
and you just have to
learn to live with that."

40:29.793 --> 40:31.676
Well, guess what.

40:33.985 --> 40:36.090
I got him.

40:36.428 --> 40:39.880
_

40:40.102 --> 40:42.072
You did?

40:42.328 --> 40:44.328
That's wonderful.

40:47.696 --> 40:50.800
And then they took him again,

40:50.825 --> 40:52.325
Gabi.

40:52.449 --> 40:54.399
They drove away with him,

40:54.451 --> 40:57.119
right in front of my eyes.

40:58.010 --> 41:00.947
I'm so sorry, Curtis.

41:02.162 --> 41:05.969
That night, in the bar...

41:07.535 --> 41:10.080
before everything went to hell in Prague,

41:10.475 --> 41:13.303
I should have gone home with you.

41:17.053 --> 41:19.662
You can bring him in again.

41:20.242 --> 41:22.789
No.

41:24.012 --> 41:26.095
No, I'll never get him.

41:26.600 --> 41:29.601
And I'll never get you, will I?

41:36.884 --> 41:39.558
He's all yours now, Gabi.

41:39.799 --> 41:42.758
May patience always bring you roses.

41:43.143 --> 41:45.126
Curtis...

41:47.102 --> 41:49.821
what do you mean?

41:55.833 --> 41:58.000
Curtis.
