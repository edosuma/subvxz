00:46.045 --> 00:48.615
- Oh, my God...
- Freedom.

00:49.015 --> 00:51.752
I feel like my mascara's running,
is my mascara running?

00:52.052 --> 00:54.188
It looks good. Like the cover
of Courtney Love's album.

00:54.288 --> 00:57.157
- You just need a crown.
- There's a crown.

00:57.357 --> 00:59.993
Hey, Noel, Noel,
can we borrow your crown?

01:00.093 --> 01:01.895
We just need it for like a second.

01:01.995 --> 01:04.563
- Wow.
- We just got the royal finger.

01:04.664 --> 01:05.931
I never liked her.

01:10.769 --> 01:12.906
What did we just go through?

01:13.006 --> 01:15.681
I mean, what was that,
a prom or a Celine Dion listening party?

01:19.511 --> 01:20.647
Don't shoot this part.

01:20.747 --> 01:23.516
- Okay, what is this place? Tell us...
- You'll see when we get there.

01:23.616 --> 01:27.220
Okay, we're doing 20 questions.
What is this place?

01:27.520 --> 01:30.891
- Do they have food?
- Not have 20 questions.

01:30.991 --> 01:34.461
- What, you can't just ask a question?
- Aren't we going to the hotel? I'm very confused.

01:34.561 --> 01:36.730
I just want to say, "Hey, what's up?"

01:36.830 --> 01:40.167
to all of the future versions of
ourselves watching this right now.

01:40.267 --> 01:46.239
I hope that we all learn to be as happy
and beautiful as these two right here

01:46.339 --> 01:50.308
'cause they are going to have
the best prom night of any of us.

01:51.377 --> 01:53.146
- I just wanna say...
- Hold on, let me get this.

01:53.346 --> 01:54.973
Tonight could've bit ass.

01:55.748 --> 01:59.753
Except it didn't because
we were together.

01:59.853 --> 02:03.330
Don't make me cry. My mascara is
already fucked up enough as it is.

02:03.430 --> 02:06.091
- You look pretty!
- Guys, I love our group.

02:08.727 --> 02:10.794
Guys, what are we doing?

02:11.797 --> 02:14.167
Chill out, just live a little.

02:14.367 --> 02:17.737
- We're not going to get caught.
- This is not legal. This is not legal.

02:17.837 --> 02:20.807
Danielle, you're going to love
that you did this later on.

02:21.307 --> 02:25.043
- And Savannah's getting naked.
- Oh, no. No, no, no.

02:27.079 --> 02:28.509
No, Danielle.

02:29.616 --> 02:33.053
If we get a rare disease from this water,
at least we'll all die together.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.217
I'm not leaving my dress on the
wet ground. It's dry-clean-only

02:35.317 --> 02:37.417
and my mom will kill me.

02:38.825 --> 02:41.094
On the count of Celine Dion.

02:41.194 --> 02:44.495
One, two, Celine Dion!

03:05.083 --> 03:09.622
No, no, no. You can no longer
work on your taxes from 1998.

03:09.722 --> 03:13.357
Yeah, I cannot amend
your '98 return. No.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.164
Hi, Dad.

03:17.264 --> 03:20.198
No, no, no, I'm not laughing
at your situation.

03:22.968 --> 03:26.672
Yeah. No, there's a strict
statute of limitations.

04:07.646 --> 04:12.218
So sorry, I'm so sorry. I didn't realize
my dad wanted me to work until 6:00.

04:12.318 --> 04:14.855
I can't believe you're still filling
in for your dad's old sign girl.

04:15.455 --> 04:18.791
Yeah, I'm just still trying to figure out
what kind of counseling I'm going to do.

04:18.992 --> 04:21.194
- Okay, Al, it's show time.
- Let's see it already.

04:21.293 --> 04:24.230
The decorator just put the
finishing touches on it yesterday.

04:24.330 --> 04:26.330
After you!

04:28.234 --> 04:29.215
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

04:32.073 --> 04:35.008
- Oh, my God.
- You have outdone yourself.

04:35.108 --> 04:39.012
This is impressive. I thought you
were gonna have, like, a fish tank.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.881
Look at the nipples on this guy.

04:44.450 --> 04:46.853
Oh, my God, we're going to
be so popular, Savannah.

04:46.953 --> 04:48.488
That is the VIP section.

04:48.588 --> 04:52.125
We can come any night of the week
and have our own special space.

04:52.225 --> 04:56.963
It is so sexy. I love that we get to be VIP!
Okay, girls, getting ready...

04:57.157 --> 04:59.599
- Let's get this party started.
- No!

04:59.699 --> 05:01.568
- Last one, grab your penis.
- Thank you.

05:01.668 --> 05:04.170
Turn them on like this.

05:04.470 --> 05:05.672
I love it.

05:05.925 --> 05:08.473
Hey, no, look, my balls won't light up.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.711
Oh, my God, that hat is too much.

05:11.811 --> 05:14.013
I mean it truly is the tiniest
hat I've ever seen.

05:14.113 --> 05:16.349
It is, it's like suitable for a mouse.

05:16.449 --> 05:18.485
- You need to wear it to your wedding.
- I can't, I have a veil.

05:18.585 --> 05:21.321
Okay, games, games, games, games.
All right, the way this game works

05:21.421 --> 05:23.523
is you write a caption
for what you think

05:23.623 --> 05:25.792
the woman in this scene
is saying to her husband.

05:25.892 --> 05:28.311
But here is the thing...

05:28.411 --> 05:32.896
Look, look, look. Look, look.
You have to make it dirty.

05:33.900 --> 05:38.436
It'll be fun, it'll be fun, so, all right.
Ready? Set, go.

05:44.243 --> 05:45.445
All right, stop.

05:45.545 --> 05:48.049
Stop, stop, stop, pencils down.
I will go first.

05:49.249 --> 05:51.636
He said he had a package for me.

05:53.686 --> 05:55.288
All right, Danielle, you go.

05:55.588 --> 05:58.998
I love getting mail.

05:59.098 --> 06:01.598
But I spelled it M-A-L-E.

06:02.528 --> 06:04.597
It's perfect. All right,
Meg, Meg, Meg, you go.

06:04.697 --> 06:05.964
All right. So, I wrote...

06:07.799 --> 06:13.804
Hi, Matt, this is to certify that
this is the big fat cock I ordered.

06:18.410 --> 06:20.581
Wait, why would you
put Matt's name in it?

06:21.881 --> 06:24.083
Well, this is supposed
to be about you, right?

06:24.183 --> 06:27.687
No, they're about marriage,
they're not about my marriage.

06:28.287 --> 06:31.224
Right, but it's a joke,
like everyone else's.

06:31.324 --> 06:34.258
Well, it's not like everybody else's.

06:35.294 --> 06:38.064
It was a joke. It wasn't
a prediction. You know.

06:38.647 --> 06:40.397
A joke.

06:42.033 --> 06:43.403
How about we do another one?

06:43.503 --> 06:46.272
And why would you tweak
the nipples on the Buddha?

06:46.572 --> 06:48.775
That seemed, like, disrespectful.

06:48.875 --> 06:52.879
Disrespectful to who? To you?
Did you convert to Buddhism?

06:53.179 --> 06:56.849
No, that's disgusting. I'm not Buddhist.

06:56.949 --> 06:59.986
It's... That's Buddha. That's Buddha!

07:00.486 --> 07:04.289
Right, right. But you know that
was a joke about nipples. Right?

07:04.389 --> 07:06.559
And not Buddhism.

07:06.659 --> 07:11.261
Yeah, Buddha is sacred to
a lot of people, but that is...

07:12.531 --> 07:14.601
This is a party,
so let's just forget about it.

07:14.701 --> 07:16.602
Okay, yeah, no, forgotten.

07:16.702 --> 07:19.106
- I mean, we can do another one of these.
- Yes.

07:19.206 --> 07:23.275
So this lady has a plunger
and there's a butt crack.

07:38.356 --> 07:42.312
- Hey.
- Hey, sleepy head.

07:43.028 --> 07:45.865
- Good morning.
- Oh, wow.

07:46.165 --> 07:48.646
I shot these on Tuesday.

07:48.746 --> 07:50.804
They were such an amazing couple.

07:50.904 --> 07:53.607
They were so open to all of my ideas.

07:54.407 --> 07:56.142
Great. Where is that?

07:56.242 --> 07:58.311
Over in Seattle. We had to
go near the shipyards though

07:58.411 --> 08:00.346
so we could get something
a little more edgy.

08:00.446 --> 08:03.850
- 'Cause I mean, look at that wall.
- Yeah.

08:04.050 --> 08:08.919
Hey, weren't you supposed to go
to that career counselor today?

08:09.454 --> 08:12.291
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

08:12.691 --> 08:14.013
You should...

08:14.113 --> 08:18.064
Yeah. Yeah, okay. I'll go get ready.

08:18.164 --> 08:19.531
Good.

08:36.815 --> 08:40.885
- Hello, is somebody there?
- It's me, you don't have to come out.

08:42.419 --> 08:43.323
What's this?

08:43.423 --> 08:45.692
What's what?
I'm just gonna watch some TV.

08:45.792 --> 08:48.328
Megan, I don't think
I like this new habit.

08:48.928 --> 08:52.732
I spoke with Anthony, and he said you were
meeting with the career counselor today.

08:52.832 --> 08:56.602
My God, I know exactly what she's going
to say. It's just a waste of time.

08:56.702 --> 08:58.938
Megan, honey, I don't want to see
you throw away your education.

08:59.038 --> 09:00.832
- You have an advanced degree.
- I know.

09:00.932 --> 09:03.343
And your father should have never
given you that stupid job because now...

09:03.443 --> 09:06.479
- Is that my girl?
- Hey, what are you doing home?

09:06.679 --> 09:07.680
It's his home.

09:08.080 --> 09:10.883
- Taking the day off.
- Yeah, me too.

09:10.983 --> 09:11.951
Wanna stay for dinner?

09:12.051 --> 09:13.253
- Yeah.
- Ed.

09:13.753 --> 09:16.911
- Hey, is it "make your own pizza" night?
- Sure, great idea.

09:17.011 --> 09:18.465
- Yeah.
- Great idea.

09:38.610 --> 09:42.849
I promise to love you,
to cherish you and to hold you

09:42.949 --> 09:47.020
and to be the rock in our relationship
for the rest of our days.

09:48.020 --> 09:51.290
I promise to be your baby's breath
when we wake each morning.

09:51.390 --> 09:54.825
And to be your evening rose
at day's end.

09:55.961 --> 09:58.030
And I promise to be your safe harbor

09:58.130 --> 10:01.134
when the boat is rocking
and when it's not rocking.

10:01.234 --> 10:06.137
I give you the bride and the groom,
Mr. and Mrs. Wanamaker!

10:13.311 --> 10:15.748
And here they are

10:15.848 --> 10:20.319
dancing to the song Mrs. Wannamaker
has picked for their first dance together

10:20.419 --> 10:22.553
as man and wife.

11:21.746 --> 11:24.484
My dad used to make yipping sounds

11:24.584 --> 11:28.087
when I first started to take you out
because he said it was puppy love.

11:28.187 --> 11:29.289
I know. I remember.

11:29.389 --> 11:32.525
Yeah, well, you know,
but it wasn't puppy love.

11:32.625 --> 11:37.628
No... I mean, unless we stayed
puppies for a seriously long time.

11:40.398 --> 11:42.635
- Listen...
- What?

11:43.209 --> 11:48.908
Look... I know it's taken me
a really long time to get here.

11:49.408 --> 11:50.944
What are you talking about?

11:51.044 --> 11:53.579
Okay, well, you know how I took
that guy's seminar last month?

11:53.679 --> 11:56.549
- Right.
- Well, I took a personality test.

11:56.649 --> 11:59.085
And the test came back
and the type that I am...

11:59.785 --> 12:01.854
- is a procrastinator.
- Anth, I mean...

12:01.954 --> 12:04.427
- Who makes up those tests? Come on.
- Experts.

12:04.527 --> 12:06.759
- Right.
- Like really smart people...

12:06.859 --> 12:08.194
But that's not important.

12:08.294 --> 12:13.432
What's important is that
I've been such a bonehead

12:13.532 --> 12:18.001
in waiting to do this for so long.

12:18.803 --> 12:20.873
No, no! Whoa, get up, get up!

12:20.973 --> 12:21.941
- Okay.
- Get up...

12:22.041 --> 12:23.844
Okay, I'm up, and listen,

12:23.944 --> 12:27.413
I know we have had
our trouble in the past

12:27.513 --> 12:31.150
with recognizing our moments,
but this is it.

12:31.250 --> 12:32.385
- This is our moment.
- No.

12:32.485 --> 12:35.721
No, this isn't our moment, this is
Allison's moment, this is her wedding.

12:35.921 --> 12:38.524
I know, and it's totally cool.

12:38.624 --> 12:40.793
When I first had the idea,
I ran it by her

12:40.893 --> 12:44.397
and she was so happy for us.

12:45.097 --> 12:49.535
And today, at lunch, I got a fortune
cookie that said, "Carpe diem."

12:49.835 --> 12:51.570
- Carpe diem?
- Yes.

12:51.670 --> 12:54.674
Hey, hey, guys, hey.
Megan, can you find my mom?

12:54.774 --> 12:57.510
She has the next dance with Matt.
I think I saw her out in the garden.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.846
Yeah, I'm... I'm...
I'm gonna come... I'm...

12:59.946 --> 13:01.414
- I'm just a second...
- Right.

13:01.914 --> 13:03.783
Sorry but she has to find my mom.

13:03.883 --> 13:07.152
- No, it's fine.
- Okay. Bye.

13:07.252 --> 13:09.019
It's fine.

13:53.798 --> 13:57.003
I'm going to go and put the
rose petals in the bridal suite.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.438
- Right this second?
- Yeah.

13:59.538 --> 14:02.308
Don't you do that
just before they leave?

14:02.408 --> 14:07.310
No, no, it's cool right now.
Okay, I'll... Later right? Later.

14:08.112 --> 14:11.282
Meg? Meg...

14:46.551 --> 14:48.821
Hey, excuse me.

14:49.521 --> 14:50.390
Yeah?

14:51.590 --> 14:53.224
You look like you party.

14:56.227 --> 14:58.230
I guess I'm technically coming from one.

14:58.330 --> 15:03.069
Cool. So... we can hardly believe this,
but we all forgot our ID's.

15:03.169 --> 15:05.771
And I mean, normally we would just
go buy some beer ourselves...

15:05.871 --> 15:10.209
but I guess we look under 21.
Which is crazy, right?

15:10.509 --> 15:12.545
I know. So...

15:12.645 --> 15:14.880
If we gave you some money or something,

15:14.980 --> 15:16.982
would you help us straighten
this whole problem out

15:17.082 --> 15:19.019
and just buy us a six-pack or something?

15:20.719 --> 15:21.821
Oh, God.

15:22.421 --> 15:26.156
You could totally keep the change.

15:27.458 --> 15:28.920
Okay.

15:30.029 --> 15:33.266
Someone did this for me when I was
your age, so I'm going to do it for you.

15:33.866 --> 15:37.337
- It's like a rite of passage, right?
- Yeah.

15:37.937 --> 15:41.040
Yeah, I... I had a
good feeling about you.

15:41.940 --> 15:43.509
That makes one of us.

15:43.609 --> 15:46.179
Hey, yo, can we get some coolers too?

15:46.279 --> 15:47.880
And some red wine.

15:47.980 --> 15:50.651
And can you get some
white wine also? Thank you.

15:52.251 --> 15:54.805
You don't have to get all that.

15:55.105 --> 15:56.405
Thank you.

15:59.353 --> 16:00.757
Yeah!

16:14.105 --> 16:18.010
- Here you go. Drink responsibly.
- Sweet.

16:18.410 --> 16:21.380
Okay, I'm out of here.
Goodnight, you guys.

16:21.780 --> 16:24.017
I'm really sorry. Can I have
a look at that for a second?

16:24.717 --> 16:27.086
Yeah, go for it.

16:27.186 --> 16:28.685
Okay.

16:29.788 --> 16:30.490
Almost.

16:30.590 --> 16:33.559
God, I haven't done this since
I was in eighth grade.

16:33.659 --> 16:35.793
Okay, okay, one more time
and then I'm going.

16:39.330 --> 16:41.867
Okay, all right, thank you so much.

16:41.967 --> 16:44.970
- Come on, where are you going?
- Hang out some more.

16:45.170 --> 16:47.137
Come on, stay.

16:49.507 --> 16:53.176
- I mean, maybe I've got an hour.
- Yeah.

16:54.445 --> 16:56.113
What are you up to?

16:57.582 --> 17:01.551
Guys, I'm really impressed.
This is truly art.

17:04.089 --> 17:05.724
- Oh. Okay.
- Come on, Megan.

17:05.825 --> 17:07.633
Go right now, go.

17:09.840 --> 17:10.859
Shit.

17:13.531 --> 17:14.898
Shit.

17:19.537 --> 17:22.208
You know when you go to a party drunk,
and everybody else is sober.

17:22.308 --> 17:24.577
Or no. Or maybe like,

17:24.676 --> 17:28.114
maybe you're the sober one
and everybody else is drunk.

17:29.014 --> 17:31.917
God, you'd think that somebody
who you've known for forever

17:32.017 --> 17:34.133
would have known what
you meant about nipples,

17:34.233 --> 17:36.347
and it's like, hey, hey, maybe...

17:36.447 --> 17:42.692
maybe, like, using Buddha as a restaurant
decoration is the bigger joke, right?

17:45.463 --> 17:47.400
Or maybe...

17:48.000 --> 17:51.670
Maybe actually they're the ones
that are telling the jokes

17:51.770 --> 17:55.838
and I'm the one that's
missing them. You know?

17:57.408 --> 18:00.947
It makes me really sad
what you're saying.

18:01.547 --> 18:02.381
It's sad...

18:02.481 --> 18:06.116
I don't even know what
you're talking about but still...

18:09.387 --> 18:12.091
- Don't get sad, Misty.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

18:12.191 --> 18:15.756
No, no, like, you shouldn't get drunk
and get sad. I mean, look at Patrick.

18:16.995 --> 18:20.199
Patrick's sad and he hasn't
even touched his wine.

18:20.299 --> 18:22.534
His folks are splitting up.

18:22.734 --> 18:26.103
His dad's being a massive
dick in the divorce.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.275
That's why we TP'd his house.

18:29.675 --> 18:32.442
- That was his house?
- Yeah.

18:35.013 --> 18:38.982
So you don't want to go out
together as friends then?

18:41.085 --> 18:44.824
Just take the sophomore.
You know, just take a real date.

18:44.924 --> 18:48.492
All right, whatever Annika.
Whatever you want.

18:52.163 --> 18:56.699
I'm sorry. I just...
I totally interrupted.

18:57.135 --> 18:59.501
What, me and Junior?

19:00.305 --> 19:03.632
No, we were just talking about the prom.

19:03.732 --> 19:06.416
You know, stupid stuff.

19:10.214 --> 19:12.716
I saw my dad cheat on my mom tonight.

19:14.585 --> 19:15.536
Really?

19:17.688 --> 19:19.857
I think he was about to get a hand job.

19:23.194 --> 19:25.197
Yeah, my...

19:25.697 --> 19:29.866
My mom left my dad and I,
like, seven years ago now.

19:30.568 --> 19:34.638
It was out of nowhere.
We don't know why she did it.

19:35.973 --> 19:38.341
You know why your dad did it?

19:40.278 --> 19:41.917
I don't.

19:42.847 --> 19:44.784
Well...

19:45.284 --> 19:47.252
If you ever want to talk,

19:47.552 --> 19:50.522
- call me.
- You're giving me a phone?

19:50.622 --> 19:53.358
I have a bunch of them.
Misty's dad sells them.

19:53.458 --> 19:57.029
I just pretty much just use that one
to hide stuff from my dad.

19:57.129 --> 19:59.031
Thanks.

19:59.231 --> 20:02.834
God, I don't even know what time it is.
How do I... Oh, no...

20:02.934 --> 20:05.738
This one? Oh, shit.

20:06.238 --> 20:08.038
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

20:17.114 --> 20:19.349
Bye, thanks for the awesome time.

20:31.495 --> 20:34.900
Megan, what happened to you?
Where have you been?

20:35.000 --> 20:38.937
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I...

20:39.137 --> 20:43.408
I... you know, I was more wasted
leaving the wedding than I knew.

20:43.508 --> 20:46.678
And by the time I got to the store,
I realized I shouldn't even be driving.

20:46.778 --> 20:50.082
And then I got sick and I was
puking in some bushes,

20:50.182 --> 20:54.288
and then my dress got dirty,
and then I had to leave the car there

20:54.388 --> 20:57.354
and take a cab here.
And now I'm back.

21:00.825 --> 21:02.928
I thought you got upset about,

21:03.028 --> 21:05.097
we'll call it the kneeling,

21:05.197 --> 21:09.468
and that you didn't come back on purpose,
but that didn't seem like you.

21:09.568 --> 21:12.604
No, no, I'm sorry.

21:12.704 --> 21:16.241
I'm sorry. I got scared, I'm sorry.

21:16.341 --> 21:20.512
I just... I don't know. Oh, God,
I'm a mess right now, look, can we...

21:20.612 --> 21:23.480
Can we talk about this tomorrow?

21:24.882 --> 21:26.585
Well...

21:27.085 --> 21:28.354
Well, baby, no...

21:29.054 --> 21:30.221
- No?
- No.

21:35.826 --> 21:37.062
- We can't.
- Right.

21:37.162 --> 21:41.333
Because we have wasted so much time...

21:41.533 --> 21:46.403
we should have just made it official
and our time is now.

21:52.310 --> 21:53.844
I know why you're hesitant.

21:55.780 --> 21:59.525
- Why?
- It's the planning and...

22:00.221 --> 22:03.956
the pressure and all the
trappings of all that.

22:04.056 --> 22:06.858
- But we don't have to do it that way.
- No?

22:06.958 --> 22:10.526
No, because we...

22:12.062 --> 22:15.067
We can elope. I was thinking.

22:15.167 --> 22:19.871
We don't have to tell our parents,
we don't have to tell our friends.

22:19.971 --> 22:22.908
- Really?
- We could go to a beach or Vegas.

22:23.008 --> 22:27.579
I was thinking Vegas 'cause we
could just check that step off

22:27.679 --> 22:30.482
and we could be married tomorrow.

22:30.582 --> 22:32.684
Would you do that? Would you do that?

22:32.784 --> 22:34.219
Yes. I would do that.

22:34.319 --> 22:36.686
- Okay.
- I would do that.

22:38.089 --> 22:42.728
Wow, we have Matt and
Allison's brunch tomorrow.

22:42.828 --> 22:46.697
But we can do it the day after.
We can go the day after tomorrow.

22:52.103 --> 22:53.973
Yeah.

22:54.473 --> 22:57.675
I can't the day after that.

22:58.660 --> 23:01.280
What do you mean, why? Why? Why?

23:01.380 --> 23:04.003
My God, I really wanted to...

23:05.450 --> 23:09.085
To go to that personal
development seminar.

23:10.454 --> 23:12.224
- Wait, really?
- Yeah.

23:12.324 --> 23:16.092
- On Orcas?
- Yeah, right.

23:17.294 --> 23:19.362
Because, you know...

23:21.031 --> 23:23.633
I'm twirling a sign for my dad,

23:24.902 --> 23:30.409
and I... I... don't know
what to do with my future.

23:31.209 --> 23:33.712
- That's awesome, Meg.
- Yeah.

23:33.812 --> 23:37.545
I'm so all for that. That's amazing.

23:37.845 --> 23:42.142
You know... They do this thing
where they give you an animal

23:42.242 --> 23:45.290
to help you visualize
new behavioral patterns.

23:45.390 --> 23:49.961
And mine was a shark. And it helped to
remind me that I need to keep progressing,

23:50.061 --> 23:52.295
otherwise I'll just sink.

23:54.865 --> 23:56.035
Yeah, so...

23:56.735 --> 24:00.437
After your seminar on Orcas...

24:02.841 --> 24:04.208
Will you...

24:06.911 --> 24:08.378
Megan Burch...

24:09.680 --> 24:11.348
run off to Vegas with me?

24:15.687 --> 24:17.654
Yes, I will.

24:18.522 --> 24:19.759
You will.

24:20.759 --> 24:21.926
There it goes.

24:28.399 --> 24:30.500
- I love you.
- I love you.

24:32.437 --> 24:34.990
- I love you so much.
- I love you so much.

24:51.922 --> 24:56.092
- What happened to you last night?
- I'm so sorry. I got sick.

24:57.561 --> 24:58.497
Sick?

24:58.597 --> 25:03.335
She had a few too many drinks and
ended up vomiting in a parking lot.

25:03.635 --> 25:04.636
I'm sorry.

25:04.736 --> 25:06.671
Why would you possibly drink that much?

25:06.771 --> 25:09.508
Now you are not in any
of the table pictures.

25:09.608 --> 25:12.345
- You are missing from the video.
- Megan Ashley Burch...

25:12.845 --> 25:15.480
You had everyone scared to death.
Where the hell have you been?

25:15.580 --> 25:17.149
I got sick.

25:17.249 --> 25:19.315
Oh. She said she got sick.

25:21.585 --> 25:23.255
I just...

25:23.555 --> 25:27.058
I just need to... I've got
to go and do something.

25:27.158 --> 25:28.525
It's okay, baby.

25:43.541 --> 25:45.646
- Hon.
- I was just leaving.

25:45.746 --> 25:47.879
Wait... What's going on with you?

25:47.979 --> 25:49.946
- What's going on with me?
- Yeah.

25:50.549 --> 25:51.628
I saw you.

25:53.250 --> 25:56.723
I saw you. So right now I don't
even want to look at you.

25:58.623 --> 26:01.793
Let's just quietly talk
about this for a second.

26:01.893 --> 26:03.729
Talk about what?
I'm sorry, talk about what?

26:03.829 --> 26:04.997
I don't know.

26:06.097 --> 26:10.002
People grow together, they grow apart.
It's always shifting.

26:11.002 --> 26:14.973
Oh, right. Three decades
of marriage to Mom

26:15.073 --> 26:17.744
and you're going to describe
what I saw as shifting?

26:20.044 --> 26:21.611
Wait.

26:25.215 --> 26:27.319
- Hey. You okay?
- Yeah.

26:27.419 --> 26:29.689
Okay. Savannah and Theo
want to talk to us.

26:29.789 --> 26:32.124
- About what?
- I don't know. Come here.

26:32.224 --> 26:36.495
Oh, good, there you are. So...
Theo and I have been talking it over

26:36.595 --> 26:39.498
and even though you guys
aren't technically married...

26:39.598 --> 26:42.834
you know, you're doing the
whole Goldie Hawn thing.

26:42.934 --> 26:46.137
You know, you've been together
the longest and you are young

26:46.237 --> 26:48.273
- and you are fun...
- So fun.

26:48.373 --> 26:50.776
And, you know, if we're
being responsible, you're stable.

26:51.276 --> 26:54.412
And what we wanted
to ask you is... Ready?

26:54.512 --> 26:57.981
Would you be our baby's godparents?

27:00.518 --> 27:02.254
- Are you kidding?
- No.

27:02.354 --> 27:04.020
- Sure...
- Yeah, we would.

27:05.390 --> 27:07.092
We would be honored.

27:07.192 --> 27:08.894
- See, I told you.
- Is it official?

27:08.994 --> 27:11.496
You are looking at
Juppiter's godparents.

27:11.596 --> 27:13.532
- There they are.
- Juppiter?

27:13.732 --> 27:15.056
- Yeah, nobody has that name.
- No one.

27:15.156 --> 27:16.468
- Oddly.
- I bet not.

27:16.568 --> 27:20.069
Like the planet.
Except two "P's," two "P's."

27:33.484 --> 27:37.289
You know, I think this is going
to be really good for me.

27:37.389 --> 27:38.390
Me too.

27:38.690 --> 27:42.994
It's like you're having your
bachelorette party but at a seminar.

27:43.094 --> 27:45.061
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

27:55.005 --> 27:57.209
Maybe you'll get a shark too.

27:57.309 --> 28:00.091
- Maybe.
- All right, bye.

28:01.845 --> 28:04.047
Drive safe.

28:06.217 --> 28:08.184
- Bye.
- Bye.

29:06.410 --> 29:08.947
- Hello?
- <i>Hey, what up? It's Annika.</i>

29:09.247 --> 29:12.418
Huge emergency, could you come down
to my school and pretend to be my mom?

29:13.218 --> 29:14.353
Whoa, what?

29:14.453 --> 29:16.588
Yeah, I'm supposed to have this
parent/teacher conference today,

29:16.688 --> 29:19.791
but I threw the note out. So my
counselor said she's gonna call my dad,

29:19.891 --> 29:23.061
but he will be super pissy if
he has to come sit down here.

29:23.161 --> 29:25.302
<i>So I told them my mom already knew
about it but were just running late.</i>

29:25.402 --> 29:28.000
So basically my point is,
could you just come down here

29:28.100 --> 29:30.336
and pretend to care about
me for like ten minutes?

29:30.969 --> 29:34.205
I'll owe you, and I know I
already owe you for the beer,

29:34.305 --> 29:37.042
but I will really, really owe you.

29:37.642 --> 29:40.512
But, but I don't look related to you.

29:40.612 --> 29:44.149
<i>Maybe I'm adopted.
What the fuck does she know?</i>

29:44.249 --> 29:47.651
- Probably not much.
- So will you come?

30:05.703 --> 30:08.907
- Hi.
- My God, you actually came through.

30:09.007 --> 30:12.544
And you have the fake wedding ring.
Nice touch.

30:13.211 --> 30:14.180
Mrs. Hunter?

30:15.380 --> 30:16.550
Hey.

30:17.848 --> 30:19.616
Hello.

30:23.187 --> 30:26.891
So, I'm becoming concerned that

30:26.991 --> 30:29.895
Annika is not taking steps
towards her future.

30:30.995 --> 30:33.353
Got it. Well...

30:33.553 --> 30:37.233
I'll be sure to talk to her
about it at home.

30:38.602 --> 30:39.938
So, we're good here?

30:40.238 --> 30:44.109
Mrs. Hunter, I realize you must
have a very busy life. But...

30:44.409 --> 30:47.646
I was hoping that we could all
come up with a plan today.

30:48.046 --> 30:52.682
Okay, sure. A plan. Do you have one?

30:56.688 --> 30:59.324
I don't know. I mean...

30:59.424 --> 31:01.993
It kind of seems stupid to
plan that far in advance

31:02.093 --> 31:04.429
when you're just gonna change
your mind anyway, right?

31:04.529 --> 31:07.766
I mean, say you had a kid,

31:07.866 --> 31:10.235
and then you realize you
didn't really want the kid.

31:10.335 --> 31:11.803
Was there a pregnancy?

31:11.903 --> 31:15.174
No, she's talking about her mom. Me.

31:16.174 --> 31:17.540
Her mom.

31:17.642 --> 31:21.146
And as her mom, I'd say that...

31:21.746 --> 31:24.182
I'm sure it does seem kind of stupid

31:24.282 --> 31:28.017
to make some sort of rigid
plan for the future. But...

31:29.754 --> 31:32.624
It's stupider not to start
paying attention to who you are

31:32.724 --> 31:35.191
and what makes you happy.

31:36.393 --> 31:38.694
Otherwise, you just float.

31:41.765 --> 31:45.604
So... there's the start of her plan.

31:46.004 --> 31:49.241
Good meeting, Mrs. Halpsky.
You've given us a lot to think about.

31:50.041 --> 31:52.644
Yes, well... Yes.

31:52.744 --> 31:55.747
So this is kind of an
interesting job to have?

31:55.847 --> 31:57.649
What kind of licensing does it take?

31:57.949 --> 32:00.118
Are you questioning my qualifications?

32:00.218 --> 32:03.588
No. No. Never mind. I...

32:03.688 --> 32:06.922
I was just curious. Come on.

32:10.327 --> 32:14.179
You worked her o-ver.

32:15.300 --> 32:18.703
You can take that stuff off now, you know.
She totally bought it.

32:20.205 --> 32:23.108
Remember half an hour ago
when you said you'd really owe me?

32:23.208 --> 32:25.444
Holy shit. You collect fast.

32:26.144 --> 32:30.212
I need to lay low for a week.
Your dad works, right?

32:36.520 --> 32:38.790
So, my dad usually
comes home around 7:00,

32:38.890 --> 32:43.395
but he's going to some lame,
divorcee mixer, so he'll be late.

32:43.995 --> 32:45.162
This is the living room.

32:46.630 --> 32:48.239
And this...

32:50.222 --> 32:52.743
- This is Lynn.
- Jesus Christ.

32:52.843 --> 32:55.306
Yeah, my mom bought her
when she saw Finding Nemo

32:55.406 --> 32:57.976
'cause she thought that
turtle was cute, but...

32:58.076 --> 33:01.245
Then she realized that
this kind doesn't swim.

33:01.345 --> 33:03.448
So she ditched you, too,
didn't she, Lynn?

33:04.648 --> 33:07.029
You don't really have to do anything
for her. Just don't step on her.

33:07.129 --> 33:10.421
- She likes to hide back here.
- Do I need to feed her?

33:10.521 --> 33:15.091
You can try, but we're pretty
sure she's an anorexic.

33:16.727 --> 33:18.196
Cool pet.

33:18.296 --> 33:21.566
So, this is the kitchen. You can
basically eat whatever you want.

33:21.766 --> 33:24.769
But this is his box of wine.

33:25.069 --> 33:27.447
So if you have some,
use the funnel with the Tupperware

33:27.547 --> 33:31.215
and fill it up with a little bit of water.
It's what we do.

33:31.515 --> 33:32.877
I don't think he really notices.

33:33.477 --> 33:37.048
And tonight, this guy Dan
has invited some people over

33:37.148 --> 33:39.717
'cause his parents are out of town.
So if you want to do that, we can do it.

33:39.817 --> 33:42.552
- And then we'll just sneak you back in.
- Okay.

33:44.988 --> 33:49.325
<i>And I'm using Humid.
It's a really gorgeous green.</i>

33:50.460 --> 33:53.465
- Under.
- Yeah, on the edge. All right.

33:54.065 --> 33:55.333
- You ready?
- Yeah.

33:55.433 --> 33:57.201
You know, I always wanted
to try a smoky eye.

33:57.301 --> 33:58.703
But I thought it might
be too much on me.

33:58.803 --> 34:00.672
I don't know. I like it.

34:00.872 --> 34:01.727
Hey!

34:02.273 --> 34:06.511
- Whoa! You're supposed to knock.
- Write a letter. I don't know you.

34:07.311 --> 34:09.013
- Megan.
- Craig.

34:09.112 --> 34:11.783
She's a new friend.
You're supposed to be at that mixer.

34:11.882 --> 34:15.887
Yeah, well, I came home to change
so I don't look like a lawyer.

34:16.387 --> 34:17.588
Wow.

34:17.688 --> 34:21.059
High school students are looking
rougher and rougher these days.

34:21.159 --> 34:24.128
- Just graduated.
- God, you can be rude sometimes.

34:24.228 --> 34:26.898
Look, she's a new friend, okay?
We're just gonna go to the movies.

34:26.998 --> 34:30.368
Right well, let me know if the
teen vampire gets the girl.

34:30.467 --> 34:34.440
And be home by 10. I know I'll be.

34:35.340 --> 34:40.312
You know, why doesn't he just stay
out if he wants to be less lonely?

34:41.312 --> 34:42.701
I don't know. Come on.

34:58.996 --> 35:00.765
Is this turning into a college party?

35:00.965 --> 35:03.932
Where's the fucking beer? This way?

35:06.603 --> 35:09.674
- Junior! What's up?
- Hey.

35:09.774 --> 35:12.608
Long time no see since Econ.

35:14.144 --> 35:18.016
- Yeah, that goes on around him all night.
- Yo. Yo, Annika!

35:18.516 --> 35:19.984
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:20.084 --> 35:22.086
Oh, yeah, let's do this!

35:22.186 --> 35:25.755
It's not a party till we start.
Who's gonna help me get this going!

35:28.926 --> 35:29.928
Here.

35:30.528 --> 35:34.163
Yeah. This is definitely
having people over.

35:42.639 --> 35:45.209
Oh, yeah. I've always loved Neil Young.

35:45.309 --> 35:47.576
I just discovered him.

35:52.783 --> 35:56.187
Okay, I'm gonna put the ice cube.
It's gonna be good.

35:56.587 --> 35:59.124
Okay, on the count of three. One...

35:59.724 --> 36:01.260
Two!

36:02.060 --> 36:06.295
Okay, girls. We need the hoop.
Come on. Hand it over. Yeah, thank you.

36:19.709 --> 36:25.480
Hey, I think it's past your curfew,
so we should probably go.

36:26.917 --> 36:29.167
This is my mom.

36:30.487 --> 36:34.693
- Wow, that's your mom?
- Yeah, she models for catalogs now.

36:35.493 --> 36:37.976
I've come across them before.

36:38.376 --> 36:40.530
I don't even know who she is anymore.

36:41.499 --> 36:42.600
You don't see her?

36:42.900 --> 36:45.501
We did phone calls for a bit.

36:46.369 --> 36:48.604
It didn't really last.

36:49.639 --> 36:51.009
Do you know where she is?

36:51.809 --> 36:56.114
There's an address. On the child
support check she sends my dad.

36:56.614 --> 37:00.315
He puts them in a box labeled,
"No, thanks."

37:02.586 --> 37:06.658
God, I'm sorry.
I'm really emotional tonight.

37:06.758 --> 37:12.161
I was already upset about Junior,
and then I came in here, and I saw her.

37:13.697 --> 37:17.300
- You like him?
- Yeah.

37:18.635 --> 37:21.639
- I might even be in love with him.
- Wow.

37:21.739 --> 37:24.232
Well, are you sure that
he doesn't like you, too?

37:25.943 --> 37:29.080
Sure he does. As a friend.

37:29.780 --> 37:31.847
Oh, right.

37:36.820 --> 37:38.523
You know, he's probably checking her tag

37:38.623 --> 37:41.523
- to see what cycle to wash it in.
- Yeah.

37:46.129 --> 37:49.534
Megan, can I borrow your car keys?
I think I left my sweatshirt out there.

37:49.834 --> 37:53.215
- Yeah. Sweatshirt's a really good idea.
- Thanks.

37:54.505 --> 37:58.176
You know, when I was in high school,
there was a guy that everyone said liked me.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.745
It was all I heard about
from my friends.

38:00.845 --> 38:03.948
But he never acted on it,
so I kept getting unsure.

38:04.548 --> 38:06.717
- Well, did he ever do anything about it?
- Yeah.

38:06.817 --> 38:10.288
Sophomore year, he asked me to be
his girlfriend in front of everyone.

38:11.338 --> 38:15.626
- And did you like him?
- Yeah. He was cute. Kind of artsy.

38:15.726 --> 38:18.112
He noticed these details about the world
and talked about them in a way

38:18.212 --> 38:22.333
that no other high school guy would.
And he was always...

38:22.433 --> 38:25.603
He was always taking pictures and...

38:26.003 --> 38:29.023
and pulling quotes out of nowhere
which I thought was pretty deep.

38:31.409 --> 38:34.078
But, but maybe it was
the start of a habit

38:34.178 --> 38:37.292
of waiting for other people
to make decisions for me.

38:37.815 --> 38:39.682
You know?

38:43.186 --> 38:45.054
Okay.

38:48.649 --> 38:50.027
Okay.

38:50.127 --> 38:53.231
Okay. He's going to be waiting inside
to do a whole deposition on me.

38:53.331 --> 38:55.366
So just go straight to my room
and wait for me there.

38:55.466 --> 38:58.334
You don't have to take your shoes off.

39:00.203 --> 39:02.240
Hey. Where you been?

39:02.340 --> 39:06.041
God! That movie was so long.

39:08.312 --> 39:09.579
- Hi.
- Hey.

39:11.348 --> 39:12.884
- Did you find everything you needed?
- Yeah.

39:12.984 --> 39:14.950
All right, cool.

39:17.554 --> 39:19.357
Are you in trouble?

39:19.457 --> 39:22.560
No. He just made me tell him
the plot to the movie we saw.

39:22.660 --> 39:25.730
And then he read the same plot to me
back online to see if it matched.

39:25.830 --> 39:28.364
But I just told him a movie I saw
last week when I ditched school.

39:30.735 --> 39:35.432
Yeah. I didn't think you had
an interest in ventriloquism.

39:35.606 --> 39:39.344
You. Downstairs. We need to talk.

39:39.744 --> 39:43.078
- I'm sorry.
- It's not your fault.

39:56.059 --> 39:57.561
Who are you?

39:57.661 --> 40:00.963
Megan. Burch.

40:02.934 --> 40:06.055
And I get that this can sometimes
be sensitive information for a woman,

40:06.155 --> 40:07.939
but how old are you?

40:08.839 --> 40:11.273
I'm in my 20s.

40:12.143 --> 40:15.479
And why are you
sleeping over at my house?

40:15.579 --> 40:18.789
Or I guess the larger question is,
why are you hanging out with my daughter?

40:20.785 --> 40:23.549
- It's kind of hard to explain.
- I bet.

40:23.649 --> 40:26.391
No, I mean, I've never really tried to.
Not even to myself.

40:26.791 --> 40:29.694
I like hearing things better
when they're not rehearsed.

40:30.494 --> 40:32.243
All right...

40:33.630 --> 40:36.434
I grew up around here.
Well, no, I didn't, I mean, you know,

40:36.534 --> 40:39.067
across the lake on the east side.

40:41.604 --> 40:45.343
I got "best couple" with my
boyfriend in high school.

40:45.443 --> 40:49.046
And I started an alternative
dance team with my friends

40:49.146 --> 40:52.374
meaning that we danced to Beastie Boys
instead of top 40. It was kind of cool.

40:53.851 --> 40:58.489
After college, I worked some random jobs,
time went by. I'm gonna skip to...

40:58.589 --> 41:03.595
Okay, I went back to grad school to get
my marriage and family therapist degree

41:04.095 --> 41:09.364
because I thought I wanted to have
honest conversations with people.

41:09.934 --> 41:11.536
But...

41:12.507 --> 41:14.036
But...

41:14.138 --> 41:17.209
I did my internship and I...

41:17.309 --> 41:20.378
I couldn't relate to any of my clients.

41:20.478 --> 41:22.380
I felt like a total fraud.

41:22.780 --> 41:26.851
So, you know, I kind of found
myself in this place. Like...

41:26.951 --> 41:30.911
this kind of weird in-between place,
you could say, you know?

41:31.011 --> 41:34.664
And, I don't know,
I was kind of floating.

41:35.059 --> 41:39.030
And then I met Annika at the grocery store,
and I skateboarded with her for a minute.

41:39.130 --> 41:43.661
And it was really fun, you know.
I liked skateboarding. I missed it.

41:43.761 --> 41:45.703
I think it was just nice
to hang out with somebody

41:45.803 --> 41:48.396
that cut me some slack for a change.

41:50.640 --> 41:52.710
I'm sorry. This isn't gonna
make any sense. This is...

41:53.110 --> 41:55.193
You know, this isn't...

41:55.293 --> 41:58.725
It's not gonna make any sense,
so just fucking sue me.

41:59.550 --> 42:01.519
I'm sorry, that wasn't
meant to be a lawyer joke.

42:01.619 --> 42:03.821
It's not a joke if it's not insulting.

42:03.921 --> 42:07.491
I don't think I know any lawyer jokes.
No, wait, I do. I've got one from my dad.

42:07.591 --> 42:09.927
What do you call 5,000 dead lawyers
at the bottom of the sea?

42:10.027 --> 42:12.463
A good start. Hey, did you hear
the one about the grown woman

42:12.563 --> 42:14.632
who started hanging out
with a bunch of pubescent kids?

42:14.732 --> 42:18.261
- No, what?
- No, I'd never heard of it before either.

42:23.339 --> 42:25.943
Come on, you gotta help me out.
So what... What were you like?

42:27.199 --> 42:28.904
Well...

42:29.246 --> 42:32.149
Senior year, I was voted
"best gorgeousness,"

42:32.249 --> 42:36.020
and most likely to pump gas
when I get older.

42:36.120 --> 42:38.690
And then I realized it would be fairly
easy for me to argue for a living

42:38.790 --> 42:41.492
if I wasn't doing it on my own behalf.

42:41.592 --> 42:46.697
And then there was this
intensely poufy white dress.

42:47.097 --> 42:51.569
It gets a little hazy because
of all the tulle or taffeta.

42:51.669 --> 42:56.374
And then there was a kid, and then
the taffeta floated out the door.

42:56.474 --> 42:58.941
And that brings us to tonight.

43:00.244 --> 43:03.681
Tonight. What a cluster fuck.

43:03.781 --> 43:06.884
- You talking about the mixer?
- Yeah.

43:07.284 --> 43:11.789
At these things, women insist on touching
your forearm in this very deliberate manner.

43:11.889 --> 43:15.826
These touches are meant to communicate
gold-star level skills in listening...

43:15.926 --> 43:18.562
In connectedness. Do you know
about this kind of gesture?

43:18.662 --> 43:20.565
Yeah. You mean this one?

43:20.765 --> 43:22.800
Yes. Do go on.

43:22.900 --> 43:23.934
- Do go on.
- Right?

43:24.034 --> 43:25.734
- Yeah.
- That's it.

43:26.504 --> 43:29.273
Dad, you do know you can't
lecture her all night, right?

43:29.473 --> 43:31.509
- She's not a kid.
- Oh, really?

43:31.909 --> 43:35.913
You snuck your friend into my house,
I think you're lacking say-so here.

43:36.013 --> 43:38.549
If you let her spend the
night in your locker...

43:38.649 --> 43:40.184
No, that's school's property.

43:40.284 --> 43:45.289
If you let her spend the night in
your backpack. Yes. No, that's...

43:45.389 --> 43:47.058
- Actually I paid for the backpack.
- Okay.

43:47.158 --> 43:49.527
So I guess that's my property.
I don't know.

43:49.627 --> 43:52.730
Why don't you put a case together.
And come back.

43:52.830 --> 43:54.298
- All right.
- When you got something solid.

43:54.398 --> 43:57.435
- I'm gonna go to bed.
- You sure? We can talk about this more.

43:57.535 --> 44:00.069
- Okay, goodbye.
- Good night, honey.

44:03.006 --> 44:07.709
The property argument is inelegant
but it ends things quickly.

44:15.151 --> 44:19.056
Listen, I deal with a lot of
scumbags on a daily basis.

44:19.156 --> 44:22.293
So I've developed a real
appreciation for the truth.

44:22.893 --> 44:24.895
I've gotta think that if you were lying,

44:24.995 --> 44:29.500
you'd make up an excuse
that's less fucking weird.

44:29.600 --> 44:31.670
You do realize that
reverting to a teenage life

44:31.770 --> 44:34.298
and sneaking into my
house is weird, correct?

44:35.339 --> 44:36.387
Right.

44:37.074 --> 44:38.868
And why were you trying to sleepover?

44:42.513 --> 44:46.884
The lease on my apartment ran out, and I
can't get into my new place for a week.

44:47.084 --> 44:48.951
And my... my friends...

44:50.753 --> 44:52.857
I just... I didn't want to...

44:52.957 --> 44:56.186
I didn't want to involve
them or my parents.

44:59.696 --> 45:01.302
All right...

45:02.766 --> 45:05.002
Fuck it. I'm not gonna kick
you out at 1:00 in the morning.

45:05.202 --> 45:06.137
Oh, thank you.

45:06.237 --> 45:09.073
You're not sleeping on the
floor of my kid's bedroom.

45:09.173 --> 45:11.507
I'm putting you in the guest room.

45:19.515 --> 45:22.554
- Got enough pillows here?
- Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

45:23.554 --> 45:27.625
Please don't let this decision
become bad parenting on my part.

45:27.725 --> 45:31.527
I won't. I really... I really won't.

45:38.101 --> 45:40.671
Wait. He let you stay?

45:40.871 --> 45:42.172
Yeah. I'm in the guest room.

45:42.272 --> 45:44.575
I'm gonna let you do
something too, Annika.

45:44.675 --> 45:47.645
I'm gonna let you do
additional chores for two weeks.

45:47.745 --> 45:50.080
Oh, no, hey, look, it's my
fault she got in trouble.

45:50.180 --> 45:51.949
She's the one who made the decision.

45:52.049 --> 45:53.651
Hey, throw another tart in
there for me, will you?

45:53.751 --> 45:55.319
It's your house.

45:55.419 --> 45:57.421
It is my house. You know, I think
I'm gonna work from home today

45:57.521 --> 46:00.791
because I really have no
good reason to trust you.

46:00.891 --> 46:02.557
- No offense.
- None taken.

46:04.161 --> 46:06.964
- Yo, your ride is here.
- Patrick.

46:07.064 --> 46:09.199
What happened to us, man?
You don't write anymore.

46:09.299 --> 46:13.204
That's a great shirt. Listen.
I know you want to kill your dad.

46:13.304 --> 46:15.873
Sometimes I do, too,
but I'm doing my best

46:15.973 --> 46:20.778
to keep this case civil on his end,
and toilet papering isn't gonna help.

46:20.878 --> 46:25.349
So if you want to take some
aggression out on a father figure...

46:25.549 --> 46:28.817
Let's get scrappy, man.
So you can move on.

46:32.622 --> 46:36.126
- You're a divorce lawyer?
- Yeah, he's my dad's.

46:36.326 --> 46:37.893
Wait, do you live here now?

46:39.929 --> 46:41.365
All right.

46:41.465 --> 46:45.335
- Yeah, we should go to school.
- Yeah. Dad, stop. Just go.

46:45.435 --> 46:47.204
Thanks for the banana, Mr. Hunter.

46:47.304 --> 46:50.408
Seriously, Patrick. Help me out, okay?

46:50.708 --> 46:53.484
I'm not... I'm not kidding actually.

46:58.978 --> 46:59.982
Good.

47:36.887 --> 47:39.391
I think I cracked her eating disorder.

47:39.990 --> 47:40.958
Really.

47:41.058 --> 47:43.260
She is feeling so
confident about her body.

47:43.360 --> 47:46.128
Yeah. I can see that.

47:49.599 --> 47:52.835
- Did you see the mail come?
- No, not yet.

47:54.103 --> 47:56.840
Show me something. What have you got?

47:56.940 --> 48:00.778
Well, okay, I'm working on a flip.

48:00.978 --> 48:03.512
So you flip it around and...

48:04.714 --> 48:06.217
And then you get on. You wanna go?

48:06.917 --> 48:09.019
- Come on.
- I'm middle-aged.

48:09.119 --> 48:12.690
No, look. Have a go. Come on.

48:12.790 --> 48:14.575
- Come on.
- Okay.

48:14.725 --> 48:17.895
- Just sort of like stand there.
- Okay.

48:17.995 --> 48:20.864
And then you want to stand to
make it go, like, this way.

48:20.964 --> 48:22.296
Okay.

48:22.666 --> 48:25.937
Oh, geez. That almost hit my dick.
Okay. That's not good.

48:26.737 --> 48:29.572
Maybe we should get the
training wheels for me.

48:50.359 --> 48:52.527
Have a good day, you guys.

48:53.663 --> 48:56.700
- Can I trust you?
- Yes, you can.

48:56.800 --> 48:59.570
Okay, if you need anything,

48:59.670 --> 49:01.271
key's under the stone tortoise.

49:01.371 --> 49:03.839
- All right. Bye.
- Bye.

49:32.068 --> 49:34.438
- Hey.
<i>- Hey!</i>

49:34.538 --> 49:38.194
<i>I was just retouching
some guy's back zits</i>

49:38.294 --> 49:41.312
<i>- out of his baby shots.</i>
- That sounds lovely.

49:41.412 --> 49:44.748
<i>No, it was amazing. It was amazing.</i>

49:44.848 --> 49:46.215
<i>How's the seminar?</i>

49:48.050 --> 49:51.113
It's so weird being away.

49:53.356 --> 49:57.594
<i>I mean, with you being gone,
I've just been holed up working, and...</i>

49:57.694 --> 49:59.163
<i>I'm afraid to see everyone.</i>

49:59.263 --> 50:01.866
<i>'Cause I feel like if I see them
I'm just gonna crack and tell them.</i>

50:02.666 --> 50:06.337
<i>I've just been pretending
to be some complete loner.</i>

50:06.737 --> 50:09.804
<i>When really I'm a secret fiancé.</i>

50:10.439 --> 50:13.444
<i>So are you getting a lot out of this?</i>

50:13.844 --> 50:16.613
Yeah. Yeah, you know...

50:16.713 --> 50:19.850
My animal's a tortoise. Go figure.

50:19.950 --> 50:23.318
<i>A tortoise? That's sweet.</i>

50:24.654 --> 50:25.910
<i>I miss you.</i>

50:27.456 --> 50:29.460
I miss you.

50:29.760 --> 50:34.932
<i>Oh, hey, your dad has left like
three million voicemail messages</i>

50:35.032 --> 50:38.102
<i>so you should probably call him. 'Cause I'm
assuming he doesn't know you're on Orcas.</i>

50:38.202 --> 50:43.173
Oh, yeah, no, I was...
I was being a secret seminarian.

50:43.273 --> 50:44.341
<i>- Makes sense.</i>
- Yeah.

50:44.441 --> 50:46.675
<i>- Wise choice.</i>
- Thanks. I thought so.

50:48.478 --> 50:51.615
- Look, I've gotta go. I gotta go.
- <i>Okay, right. All right.</i>

50:51.715 --> 50:53.383
- I love you.
<i>- Glad I caught you.</i>

50:53.483 --> 50:54.917
<i>- Love you, too. Bye, baby.</i>
- Bye.

51:13.942 --> 51:15.203
Hey.

51:17.540 --> 51:19.508
Will you go with me to see my mom?

51:22.578 --> 51:23.993
Sure.

51:50.673 --> 51:52.541
All right.

52:10.493 --> 52:12.360
My God.

52:13.829 --> 52:14.928
What is this?

52:18.602 --> 52:21.102
I don't know. It...

52:23.005 --> 52:25.074
It just kind of felt like
something I should do.

52:33.715 --> 52:37.321
God. She's been in there making
lemonade for, like, 20 minutes.

52:37.421 --> 52:39.488
I don't think she's coming out.

52:52.034 --> 52:55.839
Just take her and put her in the
car and tell her I'm sorry.

52:55.939 --> 52:58.139
And whatever else you need to.

53:02.645 --> 53:05.213
What could I possibly tell her?

53:07.049 --> 53:09.186
That I thought I'd be
the really cool mom

53:09.486 --> 53:12.791
that took her to concerts,
and she'd want to borrow my boots?

53:14.291 --> 53:18.386
But then one day I realized there's
no such thing as a cool mom.

53:18.929 --> 53:22.499
That the... cool mom is
really just the bad mom,

53:22.599 --> 53:24.699
or the mom who has become a joke.

53:28.571 --> 53:31.842
Are you Craig's girlfriend?
Is that why you're here with her?

53:31.942 --> 53:34.109
No. I'm just her friend.

53:37.480 --> 53:39.381
What does she expect?

53:42.284 --> 53:44.888
That you serve some lemonade,

53:45.188 --> 53:50.656
and you ask her five to ten
questions about her life.

53:55.297 --> 54:00.264
You treat somebody badly enough, you just
assume they'll be happy to let you go.

54:03.973 --> 54:06.675
She had... Said she
had to get something.

54:16.519 --> 54:19.487
So, after I...

54:20.422 --> 54:22.192
You know...

54:22.592 --> 54:26.430
I started doing a lot of catalog modeling,
and I ended up doing a lot of lingerie.

54:26.530 --> 54:29.597
Yeah, I know, I've seen your pictures.

54:32.102 --> 54:34.004
Well.

54:34.304 --> 54:35.939
Anyway,

54:36.039 --> 54:39.743
they send me home with so many things
from these stupid photo shoots.

54:39.843 --> 54:42.879
And I just thought that since, you know,

54:42.979 --> 54:45.349
obviously, well,
you're a growing woman...

54:45.949 --> 54:49.995
And... well, maybe there might
be some things you like in here.

54:53.923 --> 54:55.660
Do you like this one?

54:56.560 --> 54:58.628
Yeah, it's really nice.

54:58.728 --> 55:00.730
I think that's about right.

55:00.830 --> 55:03.034
I mean, do you like black?
Is black a color you like?

55:03.934 --> 55:06.154
- Sure.
- Great.

55:06.254 --> 55:09.606
Great, I have more. What about florals?

55:09.706 --> 55:11.975
I mean, do you wear nightgowns? Or...

55:12.075 --> 55:14.478
I have thongs.
Are you into thongs or no?

55:14.578 --> 55:16.813
I like that one with the bows.

55:16.913 --> 55:19.614
Great. Yeah.

55:22.551 --> 55:24.319
That's cute.

55:37.700 --> 55:39.799
- Got room for that?
- Yeah.

55:46.842 --> 55:48.879
You know, I really
needed a strapless bra.

55:49.679 --> 55:51.047
You did?

55:51.147 --> 55:53.314
Yeah. For my prom dress.

55:53.984 --> 55:55.986
It's actually really good
that she gave me one.

55:56.086 --> 55:59.820
Yeah. Yeah, no, it's really good.

56:03.926 --> 56:06.545
- You should come.
- Where?

56:06.645 --> 56:09.666
To the prom. Saturday night.
It's on this boat in Lake Union.

56:09.766 --> 56:13.570
Oh, no, I've gotta go
home Saturday, remember?

56:13.670 --> 56:16.306
You know, I've gotta get into my
new place and sort everything out.

56:16.406 --> 56:17.874
I mean, I can't just
float around forever.

56:17.974 --> 56:21.376
No. Come on. You belong there with us.

56:27.818 --> 56:30.320
Hi. I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.
Can I take your order?

56:30.420 --> 56:33.456
Can we have two mondo chococinos

56:33.556 --> 56:36.493
and two boysenberry muffin tops.
We're celebrating.

56:36.593 --> 56:37.559
10.50, please.

56:38.962 --> 56:41.662
- There you go.
- Thank you.

56:46.201 --> 56:47.068
Megan?

57:02.818 --> 57:05.822
Hey. Coinky-dink.

57:06.222 --> 57:09.793
Anthony told us that you were working
on yourself on Orcas Island.

57:10.293 --> 57:12.262
And that you probably
weren't checking your messages,

57:12.362 --> 57:14.130
so that's why you
weren't calling us back.

57:14.230 --> 57:17.898
Oh, did you call?
No, my... my phone's been off.

57:19.034 --> 57:22.839
Megan. You missed Savannah
having her baby.

57:22.939 --> 57:26.209
And you are the godmother.
The godmother!

57:26.309 --> 57:28.445
- Juppiter?
- Yesterday!

57:28.545 --> 57:30.547
No, and they went with Callisto

57:30.647 --> 57:33.515
because someone at the hospital
had a Juppiter last week.

57:33.651 --> 57:35.852
Callisto is one of Jupiter's moons.

57:36.052 --> 57:39.356
- Oh, I only knew about Io.
- Yeah, I learned there are 64.

57:39.456 --> 57:42.225
- 64?
- Anyway, the baby is here.

57:42.325 --> 57:45.095
And you're not out of town at all.
You're not immersed in some seminar

57:45.195 --> 57:47.063
trying to get your life
moving in the right direction.

57:47.163 --> 57:51.268
You are driving around
getting chococinos with...

57:51.968 --> 57:55.504
Who the hell is that?
I don't even know who that is.

57:58.141 --> 58:00.529
Meg... Is that your drug dealer?

58:00.629 --> 58:03.313
No. No. I'm not on drugs.

58:03.413 --> 58:05.366
Okay, look, here's the thing.

58:05.466 --> 58:09.788
No, I'm not... I'm not on Orcas Island.
But I am on Orcas,

58:09.888 --> 58:13.721
if you think about Orcas on a
bigger level. Like symbolically.

58:15.791 --> 58:18.061
I just, you know I...

58:18.161 --> 58:21.198
I just needed a second of personal time.
You know, I mean, it's a week,

58:21.298 --> 58:24.023
but in terms of my life, it's more like
just a second to get my shit together.

58:24.123 --> 58:27.239
And then... then I'm going home
in a couple of days. Okay?

58:29.639 --> 58:32.444
I feel like I should really tell
Anthony that you never left.

58:34.244 --> 58:37.414
What are you talking about? Oh, my God.
You're supposed to be my friend.

58:37.514 --> 58:41.302
I mean, it was you and me and Savan and
Danielle before he ever even asked me out.

58:42.685 --> 58:45.789
- But I'm not going to tell him.
- Thanks.

58:45.889 --> 58:50.227
Because he bought a ring.
And he's going to propose to you.

58:51.127 --> 58:52.862
Yeah. That's right. He did.

58:52.962 --> 58:55.499
I helped him pick it out,
and it's, like, incredible.

58:55.999 --> 58:58.153
So I bet that makes you think twice
about how ridiculous you're being

58:58.253 --> 59:00.537
with this fake Orcas stuff.

59:00.637 --> 59:03.475
Meg... I really want
this wedding for you.

59:04.040 --> 59:05.843
And it's not even the wedding.

59:06.543 --> 59:08.045
It's that we're friends.

59:08.545 --> 59:11.214
It's like how our prom,
it wasn't just a dance,

59:11.314 --> 59:14.985
it was us getting ready together. And then
how we all lied to our moms together.

59:15.185 --> 59:17.187
And stayed at the cheap hotel,

59:17.287 --> 59:20.590
and went swimming naked
in that nasty pool.

59:20.690 --> 59:23.727
And we all thought we were so cool.

59:23.827 --> 59:26.126
But if you had stayed home
that night, then...

59:26.226 --> 59:27.831
the stories wouldn't
have made sense to you.

59:28.231 --> 59:30.600
You wouldn't have been a part
of everything that night meant.

59:31.200 --> 59:35.503
I just think now that we're adults,
our lives are that times 10.

59:37.906 --> 59:39.104
What are you saying?

59:39.204 --> 59:43.589
I'm saying that I'm not going to
mess things up for you. Just...

59:44.614 --> 59:46.174
Don't mess them up for yourself.

59:59.128 --> 01:00:00.803
All right.

01:00:01.003 --> 01:00:03.066
What was that all about?

01:00:03.166 --> 01:00:05.902
Oh, she just had a message to give me.

01:00:06.985 --> 01:00:09.404
I need to get a baby gift.

01:00:12.175 --> 01:00:15.224
Hey. Where you two been?

01:00:17.814 --> 01:00:21.015
Megan took me to get some new bras.

01:00:22.118 --> 01:00:25.186
How was that? Was that fun?

01:00:26.222 --> 01:00:27.424
Fun?

01:00:27.524 --> 01:00:29.648
I'm gonna go and lie down for a while.

01:00:29.748 --> 01:00:32.896
All right. Misty is gonna
come over and have a sleepover

01:00:32.996 --> 01:00:35.999
- 'cause we have no school tomorrow.
- No school, why is that?

01:00:36.099 --> 01:00:38.568
Yeah, it's a staff development day.

01:00:38.668 --> 01:00:41.506
Okay, well, keep Misty
away from our valuables.

01:00:43.006 --> 01:00:45.175
I was joking. That was a joke.

01:00:45.675 --> 01:00:47.942
Yeah. I know.

01:00:48.510 --> 01:00:51.868
- Goodbye.
- Want some poppy snaps?

01:00:54.416 --> 01:00:56.086
I totally forgot about this guy.

01:00:56.186 --> 01:01:00.590
Oh, my God. Herschel Thrasher.
What was his mom on?

01:01:00.690 --> 01:01:03.493
You really don't have a chance in life
if your mom wears a belly chain.

01:01:04.904 --> 01:01:06.963
Look at Tiffany Wilmington
with her real teeth.

01:01:07.063 --> 01:01:09.499
- Oh, my God.
- Who is she dating now?

01:01:10.321 --> 01:01:13.771
Kyle Stempano, I think. Is that right?

01:01:14.871 --> 01:01:15.939
I really wouldn't know.

01:01:16.973 --> 01:01:19.545
I'm gonna go get some snacks, okay?

01:01:19.645 --> 01:01:21.277
- Okay.
- Bye.

01:01:21.378 --> 01:01:23.323
- Later. Peace!
- Peace!

01:01:23.423 --> 01:01:25.323
Peace!

01:01:32.654 --> 01:01:34.357
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:01:34.457 --> 01:01:35.959
- Come in.
- Yeah?

01:01:36.059 --> 01:01:39.295
- Thanks for knocking.
- It's okay. Thought I'd be polite.

01:01:39.395 --> 01:01:41.130
Them's the rules.

01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:43.867
- Can I complain to you?
- Sure, go ahead.

01:01:44.067 --> 01:01:47.370
I'm so fucking stressed out right now,
all I want is a drink.

01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:49.973
I went for the box wine in the fridge,

01:01:50.073 --> 01:01:53.210
and it's funny how much that
vintage tastes like tap water.

01:01:54.110 --> 01:01:59.478
Yeah, you know, I'm, yeah.
The box stuff really is never very good.

01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:03.319
So, what are you working on?

01:02:03.419 --> 01:02:06.623
A letter to opposing counsel.
During mediation my client agreed

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:09.092
to give back two of her handguns
to her husband,

01:02:09.192 --> 01:02:12.262
and now she's decided they
were anniversary gifts to her.

01:02:12.362 --> 01:02:15.732
Wow. That's romantic.
Are you gonna win?

01:02:15.832 --> 01:02:20.602
I hope so because it would kill me to
see a mother separated from her guns.

01:02:23.405 --> 01:02:25.073
Hey...

01:02:28.343 --> 01:02:30.847
- No, never mind.
- What?

01:02:30.947 --> 01:02:32.672
You want to come get a drink with me?

01:02:34.017 --> 01:02:35.719
- Now?
- Yeah.

01:02:35.819 --> 01:02:38.288
Well, I'm supposed to be in
the middle of a sleepover.

01:02:38.488 --> 01:02:40.623
Oh, they're like little animals.
They're like gerbils.

01:02:40.723 --> 01:02:44.761
They have next to no sense of time.
Aren't you leaving soon?

01:02:44.861 --> 01:02:47.079
- Yeah.
- One pop.

01:02:57.639 --> 01:02:59.607
Be careful.

01:03:05.948 --> 01:03:08.186
Okay, we gotta hurry.

01:03:13.251 --> 01:03:14.989
Don't slip.

01:03:21.763 --> 01:03:23.766
- Thank you.
- Okay.

01:03:23.866 --> 01:03:24.834
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:03:24.934 --> 01:03:27.201
Anybody here? All right.

01:03:27.769 --> 01:03:29.973
- Waitress won't give it to 'em.
- Right.

01:03:30.073 --> 01:03:31.939
So he says...

01:03:32.774 --> 01:03:34.911
- Hey.
- Hey, how you doing?

01:03:35.011 --> 01:03:36.379
Just about closing.

01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:40.483
Oh, well, that's perfect for our needs.
We just want a round of shots.

01:03:40.683 --> 01:03:43.806
- Bourbon.
- Bourbon. Hey. Wow! Like your style.

01:03:43.906 --> 01:03:45.989
- Thank you.
- Bourbon in a Mexican restaurant.

01:03:46.089 --> 01:03:47.715
- Can I get a Pacifico?
- Of course.

01:03:48.793 --> 01:03:51.993
I think doing cheers is cheesy,
so if you need to touch glass to glass,

01:03:52.093 --> 01:03:54.763
- use my watch.
- So do I.

01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:58.635
You have time for another?

01:03:58.735 --> 01:03:59.702
- Yes.
- Yeah.

01:03:59.802 --> 01:04:02.307
- Thank you.
- Twist my arm.

01:04:03.272 --> 01:04:06.027
So, what's up with that Junior kid?

01:04:06.127 --> 01:04:08.678
Is my daughter in love
with that Rico Suave kid?

01:04:08.878 --> 01:04:12.182
Whoa, that's friend-friend privilege.
Can't talk about that.

01:04:12.282 --> 01:04:15.151
Not much going on between
the ears on that one, is there?

01:04:15.351 --> 01:04:18.354
You know, at the moment, she doesn't
need him to be smart. Thank you.

01:04:18.454 --> 01:04:20.457
Yeah, I guess it's easier
when you're young.

01:04:20.957 --> 01:04:24.792
All you need from someone
is to feel stupid around them.

01:04:26.128 --> 01:04:27.597
What do you need when you're older?

01:04:28.197 --> 01:04:33.267
You need to feel like you're on
the same side of what seems stupid.

01:04:37.606 --> 01:04:39.842
- You really like hanging out with her?
- Yeah.

01:04:39.942 --> 01:04:45.046
- You genuinely like hanging out with her?
- I genuinely think she's really cool.

01:04:47.083 --> 01:04:49.620
You know, good for her. I like that kid.

01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:53.757
- I do, I do. I love her.
- Good.

01:04:54.357 --> 01:04:57.694
I'm a little hard on her. Maybe I haven't
been giving her enough credit.

01:04:58.394 --> 01:05:00.463
She's a good kid.

01:05:00.563 --> 01:05:03.399
At least she didn't end up
paying attention to me.

01:05:03.499 --> 01:05:07.513
You know. Could be... could be worse.

01:05:07.637 --> 01:05:10.675
I can't go back and fix my
own fucked up head but...

01:05:12.275 --> 01:05:15.968
She doesn't have to get bitter
in the first place, does she?

01:05:16.068 --> 01:05:18.414
No. I think we need another drink.

01:05:18.514 --> 01:05:20.083
- Let's have a drink.
- Let's have a drink.

01:05:20.383 --> 01:05:22.684
- No cheers.
- No cheers.

01:05:25.821 --> 01:05:26.822
Right?

01:05:28.724 --> 01:05:31.628
You know, so, monks and priests, right?

01:05:31.728 --> 01:05:33.997
They say they get
their calling from God.

01:05:34.097 --> 01:05:37.500
But that means... that means
it was from something outside.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.782
It wasn't from something inside, right?
And everybody thinks that that's just great.

01:05:41.537 --> 01:05:42.772
- Yeah.
- Right?

01:05:42.872 --> 01:05:44.407
What the fuck, right?

01:05:44.507 --> 01:05:47.296
Sorry, guys. You're gonna have to
close your tab out. Going home.

01:05:47.396 --> 01:05:48.789
Aw, man.

01:05:48.889 --> 01:05:50.747
I... I...

01:05:50.847 --> 01:05:53.650
This is your coat.
So I don't have any money.

01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:55.418
No, no, no. My responsibility.

01:05:55.518 --> 01:05:57.587
- Okay, good.
- I dragged you out.

01:05:57.687 --> 01:06:00.125
Put your money away. There, it's on me.

01:06:00.225 --> 01:06:03.073
- It's on... It's on you.
- It's on Blockbuster.

01:06:03.173 --> 01:06:05.073
Gosh darn it.

01:06:16.204 --> 01:06:18.239
- That was fun.
- Yeah.

01:06:24.079 --> 01:06:27.083
Yeah, I just... I just wanna...

01:06:27.183 --> 01:06:29.418
I just wanna say thank you for...

01:06:29.518 --> 01:06:31.988
- For what?
- For letting me stay.

01:06:32.088 --> 01:06:36.890
Well, I loved having you, you know.

01:06:37.626 --> 01:06:39.693
You're good people.

01:06:42.464 --> 01:06:44.232
And...

01:07:07.122 --> 01:07:11.394
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait...
Wait, wait, wait.

01:07:11.494 --> 01:07:13.629
I just... I just... I just...

01:07:13.729 --> 01:07:15.531
I don't think we should
finger-bang in the street.

01:07:15.631 --> 01:07:17.156
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You know?

01:07:17.256 --> 01:07:20.837
Of course. No, no, no, no, no.
We should go to my... the house.

01:07:20.937 --> 01:07:22.572
- House, yeah, yeah, the house.
- Yeah.

01:07:22.672 --> 01:07:26.576
Well, maybe we take
Annika's t-shirt off.

01:07:26.676 --> 01:07:28.578
- Yeah.
- Maybe that's a little creepy.

01:07:28.678 --> 01:07:29.511
Yeah.

01:07:36.184 --> 01:07:38.087
Yeah. That's hot.

01:07:38.187 --> 01:07:43.526
Yeah, I'm just wearing, like, a little
t-shirt with, like, crotchless panties.

01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:46.763
- Who's she talking to?
- Our math teacher.

01:07:46.863 --> 01:07:49.234
- Does he know it's her?
- No.

01:07:49.334 --> 01:07:53.302
Okay, good. I'm just gonna...
I'm just gonna brush my teeth, okay?

01:07:53.402 --> 01:07:55.569
Yeah, yeah, you're good.

01:08:41.448 --> 01:08:42.399
Hey.

01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:44.316
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:08:47.555 --> 01:08:49.358
Got a headache?

01:08:49.457 --> 01:08:51.359
Yeah.

01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:54.531
This is an old hangover cure
from college. You want one?

01:08:55.331 --> 01:08:57.098
Yeah.

01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:04.337
It's very scientific.

01:09:06.241 --> 01:09:08.975
- I'm not messing around.
- No.

01:09:09.877 --> 01:09:11.581
You know...

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:14.984
You can stay here a little
longer if you need to.

01:09:16.285 --> 01:09:19.889
Yeah, you know, I've gotta
get back into my new place.

01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:21.856
So...

01:09:23.725 --> 01:09:25.493
Okay.

01:09:39.808 --> 01:09:43.345
All right. I'm calling
Patrick and Junior again.

01:09:43.446 --> 01:09:45.511
Laggies.

01:09:52.854 --> 01:09:54.324
Do I have something on my face?

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:56.633
Yeah.

01:09:57.333 --> 01:09:58.833
My dad's saliva.

01:10:00.328 --> 01:10:03.798
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah. How about that?

01:10:04.833 --> 01:10:06.336
I think you're pretty but...

01:10:07.636 --> 01:10:11.641
- That's my dad.
- I... Oh, God, I... Annika, I...

01:10:11.741 --> 01:10:14.143
I don't know what happened,
you know. I mean, I...

01:10:14.243 --> 01:10:16.379
I was thinking the whole time like,
"What are you doing, Megan?"

01:10:16.479 --> 01:10:20.147
No, no, no, no.
I really don't need details.

01:10:23.251 --> 01:10:25.889
Look, I've had a couple of
hours to think about it.

01:10:26.889 --> 01:10:30.293
And I just keep thinking about
how lonely he's been.

01:10:31.093 --> 01:10:33.296
You know, and how hard
he's been trying with me lately.

01:10:34.396 --> 01:10:36.028
And as much shit I talk about him...

01:10:37.128 --> 01:10:38.928
I love him.

01:10:39.268 --> 01:10:42.939
You know, and I want him to be happy.
And I want you to be happy.

01:10:43.439 --> 01:10:46.140
You know, so if you two
are happy together, then...

01:10:48.844 --> 01:10:50.651
It might be kind of cool.

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:56.502
And obviously, he can't come
with us when we go out. But...

01:10:58.686 --> 01:11:00.623
You know, if he wanted to take
you to the movies, or whatever,

01:11:01.023 --> 01:11:04.907
- I've decided not to lose my shit over it.
- Annika, I don't think that dating

01:11:05.007 --> 01:11:08.030
- is in the future for your dad and me.
- Did I just hear you're boning Mr. Hunter?

01:11:08.230 --> 01:11:11.699
- No, it's not like that.
- Ew. Gross.

01:11:13.702 --> 01:11:17.407
- Yo, finally.
- Fucking drop it already, I'm here, okay?

01:11:19.057 --> 01:11:20.776
Bad mood.

01:11:20.876 --> 01:11:22.511
Hey, the tux place is at the other end.

01:11:22.611 --> 01:11:24.647
All right, so we'll meet
back here in like an hour?

01:11:24.847 --> 01:11:25.767
Sure.

01:11:26.267 --> 01:11:28.433
If you can live without me that long.

01:11:28.918 --> 01:11:30.885
I'm not sure I can.

01:11:34.355 --> 01:11:35.958
You've gotta dance
with him tomorrow night.

01:11:36.058 --> 01:11:38.992
I mean, who's to say?

01:11:41.229 --> 01:11:43.566
Okay, I'm trying this one on.

01:11:44.266 --> 01:11:45.201
It's you.

01:11:45.701 --> 01:11:47.568
I know.

01:11:50.371 --> 01:11:52.074
- No.
- No?

01:11:52.174 --> 01:11:55.145
You wear white to your wedding.
Not to prom.

01:11:55.945 --> 01:11:58.247
Shut up. I like it.

01:11:58.447 --> 01:12:00.916
This is it. This is it!

01:12:01.016 --> 01:12:03.786
I look so fucking good, man.

01:12:03.886 --> 01:12:07.156
I don't even know why those other chicks
are even gonna bother to show up.

01:12:07.756 --> 01:12:08.796
What do you think?

01:12:08.996 --> 01:12:11.494
- You look so cute.
- Good?

01:12:11.594 --> 01:12:13.162
- You should buy it.
- Yeah.

01:12:13.262 --> 01:12:14.230
Do you have any gum in your bag?

01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:15.665
- Right there?
- Little shorter.

01:12:15.865 --> 01:12:17.601
- You can't take it a little more.
- Yes, you can.

01:12:18.601 --> 01:12:21.137
Yeah, but like, shorter.

01:12:21.537 --> 01:12:23.172
- You want my ass out?
- No.

01:12:23.472 --> 01:12:25.306
She wants my ass o...

01:12:28.943 --> 01:12:31.278
"A and M. Best couple forever."

01:12:32.547 --> 01:12:34.209
He had it engraved?

01:12:37.785 --> 01:12:39.054
Are you married?

01:12:41.089 --> 01:12:42.557
I'm only engaged.

01:12:46.795 --> 01:12:48.390
Only engaged.

01:12:48.964 --> 01:12:51.167
Who's the A?

01:12:51.267 --> 01:12:52.594
You don't know him.

01:12:53.502 --> 01:12:54.992
My dad know about him?

01:12:57.138 --> 01:12:58.167
No.

01:13:00.208 --> 01:13:01.742
Are you going back to him?

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:06.308
Yes.

01:13:09.651 --> 01:13:11.458
God, you're even worse than my mom.

01:13:12.755 --> 01:13:14.790
You know, at least when she
pulled my dad into her bullshit,

01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:16.972
she didn't know she was gonna leave.

01:13:24.265 --> 01:13:26.100
Oh, shit.

01:13:30.905 --> 01:13:33.242
God, Megan, don't even turn around
and look at me right now.

01:13:33.342 --> 01:13:35.845
Look, I'll swear on whatever
you want me to swear on.

01:13:35.945 --> 01:13:38.147
I really like your dad.
I wasn't faking it.

01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:41.951
You're a huge fucking liar. Even your
fake ring was fake at being fake.

01:13:42.051 --> 01:13:43.619
Who knows what else
you're trying to lie to me about.

01:13:43.719 --> 01:13:44.950
She's really hurt, Megan.

01:13:45.050 --> 01:13:47.657
Oh, shut up, Junior. You pulled
your own bullshit with her, too.

01:13:47.757 --> 01:13:49.959
Oh, don't you even try
to bring him into this.

01:13:50.059 --> 01:13:52.695
Can you please stop the fucking
yelling while I'm driving?

01:13:52.795 --> 01:13:54.797
Who gives a fuck about
your dad's love life?

01:13:54.897 --> 01:13:57.700
He helps break up other people's
relationships every fucking day.

01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:59.936
Don't be a dick to Annika
just because your dad's a dick

01:14:00.036 --> 01:14:01.437
and her dad's trying to
bring home some cash.

01:14:01.537 --> 01:14:05.307
- Shut up, Misty! How does any...
- I don't know what crawled up your ass today...

01:14:05.407 --> 01:14:07.980
You want to hear what
crawled up my ass, Annika?

01:14:10.311 --> 01:14:11.814
Oh, God!

01:14:12.214 --> 01:14:16.052
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Are you okay?
Is anybody hurt? Are you okay?

01:14:16.352 --> 01:14:18.120
- Is your neck okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:19.887
Okay.

01:14:21.422 --> 01:14:23.264
I'm drunk, Megan.

01:14:27.695 --> 01:14:30.488
He's sending me to
boarding school next year.

01:14:31.433 --> 01:14:34.167
And she didn't even fight him on it.

01:14:35.737 --> 01:14:40.175
I opened the bottle of wine you bought me,
and I put it in the OJ container.

01:14:40.275 --> 01:14:42.743
I just didn't want to care anymore.

01:14:45.346 --> 01:14:46.925
Okay.

01:14:47.049 --> 01:14:50.018
Okay, everyone out of the car.
Out of the car right now.

01:14:52.687 --> 01:14:55.655
When the cops get here, I was driving.

01:14:58.394 --> 01:15:01.364
The wheels slipped.
I think my palms got sweaty.

01:15:02.264 --> 01:15:04.101
Can you touch your nose
with your left hand?

01:15:05.501 --> 01:15:07.568
With...

01:15:09.137 --> 01:15:12.098
Are you able to recite
the alphabet backwards?

01:15:14.009 --> 01:15:17.379
Z-X-Y-V...

01:15:17.479 --> 01:15:20.850
No, W, W, V... Oh, God.

01:15:21.150 --> 01:15:23.953
I don't think that I could do that
even if I hadn't been drinking.

01:15:24.053 --> 01:15:26.454
- Have you been drinking?
- No.

01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:31.725
Please, stay here a moment.

01:15:40.068 --> 01:15:43.039
I just wanted to say that what you're
doing for Patrick is pretty solid.

01:15:43.339 --> 01:15:45.174
This officer thinks
I've been driving drunk,

01:15:45.274 --> 01:15:48.045
and I might be legally drunk.
I don't know.

01:15:48.945 --> 01:15:52.847
- I had some gin this morning.
- What the fuck, Megan?

01:15:55.016 --> 01:15:59.054
Miss Burch, I'm going to ask you to take
a breath test. Is that okay with you?

01:15:59.154 --> 01:16:01.424
- Yes.
- I want you to blow into this tube.

01:16:01.524 --> 01:16:03.724
Continue to blow until I say stop.
Is that understood?

01:16:08.596 --> 01:16:10.530
Keep blowing please.

01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:13.936
Keep blowing. That's good.

01:16:14.536 --> 01:16:17.248
Miss Burch, I'm gonna ask you to turn around
and put your hands behind your back.

01:16:20.174 --> 01:16:22.845
- Hold your hands together, please.
- Wait, no, she... she didn't do anything.

01:16:22.945 --> 01:16:25.948
- No, chill out, Patrick.
- Relax, please. Please, relax.

01:16:26.248 --> 01:16:30.019
- This way, ma'am.
- Annika, can you call your dad to come, please?

01:16:30.119 --> 01:16:31.287
Watch your head, please.

01:16:31.587 --> 01:16:33.922
- Are you in?
- Yeah.

01:16:34.022 --> 01:16:36.189
What are we gonna do?

01:16:41.662 --> 01:16:43.430
Burch.

01:16:45.466 --> 01:16:47.267
Your lawyer's here to see you.

01:16:53.975 --> 01:16:55.909
Thank you, Officer.

01:16:59.247 --> 01:17:01.583
Well, I've planned your escape.

01:17:01.683 --> 01:17:03.285
It's gonna involve a lot of soap.

01:17:03.385 --> 01:17:07.089
We're gonna have to roofie this guy
over here. But I think we can do it.

01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:10.359
- Annika didn't tell you.
- She told me.

01:17:10.659 --> 01:17:14.797
I know Patrick was driving.
And I know what you did for him.

01:17:14.997 --> 01:17:18.509
- I think it's a really stand-up thing.
- Craig...

01:17:21.703 --> 01:17:24.047
I've got something to tell you,
and you're gonna hate me.

01:17:24.673 --> 01:17:26.438
I doubt that.

01:17:27.910 --> 01:17:33.029
I am not waiting for a new apartment.

01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:38.453
My boyfriend, the one that I got
"best couple" with, he proposed.

01:17:38.553 --> 01:17:41.321
And I needed some time.

01:17:42.857 --> 01:17:45.158
I'm engaged to be married.

01:17:49.964 --> 01:17:52.132
So you...

01:17:55.236 --> 01:17:57.640
So you didn't lose your lease?
That's not why you've been staying over?

01:17:57.740 --> 01:17:59.975
No. I just...

01:18:00.275 --> 01:18:04.439
I needed to get my head together,
and I gave myself a week.

01:18:07.548 --> 01:18:09.562
When are you getting married?

01:18:10.818 --> 01:18:11.747
Tomorrow.

01:18:13.388 --> 01:18:14.722
You know, I mean, if I'm not in jail.

01:18:14.822 --> 01:18:18.614
I... we're eloping.
I'm getting married tomorrow.

01:18:19.661 --> 01:18:22.563
- That's really something.
- Yeah.

01:18:23.397 --> 01:18:25.365
Tomorrow.

01:18:27.301 --> 01:18:28.401
Congratulations.

01:18:28.501 --> 01:18:30.639
- I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
- No, that's... No need.

01:18:30.739 --> 01:18:33.609
I'm such a shitty person.
I really want to tell you everything.

01:18:34.209 --> 01:18:37.379
The first time I met the kids,
I bought them alcohol.

01:18:37.679 --> 01:18:40.382
It never happened again, but that's
where Patrick got the wine from

01:18:40.482 --> 01:18:43.617
and I went with Annika to see her mom.

01:18:51.692 --> 01:18:53.360
So you met...

01:19:03.204 --> 01:19:06.041
Shit. I'm gonna stop there.

01:19:06.241 --> 01:19:08.643
That's all the lies though.
You know, the...

01:19:10.745 --> 01:19:12.414
The rest is true.

01:19:12.514 --> 01:19:14.516
However, I acted around you,
that was true.

01:19:14.616 --> 01:19:16.452
Whatever happened between us,
that was true.

01:19:16.552 --> 01:19:18.687
And I know that I
shouldn't have kissed you.

01:19:18.787 --> 01:19:22.391
I know I shouldn't have done that.
It just got so confusing.

01:19:22.491 --> 01:19:25.183
'Cause I had this feeling like I
was already in love with you.

01:19:33.968 --> 01:19:36.036
Say something.

01:19:38.439 --> 01:19:41.677
The number you blew at the
scene was borderline.

01:19:41.777 --> 01:19:45.612
The number you blew at the station
was under. So they're gonna release you.

01:19:46.747 --> 01:19:49.130
- Something else?
- Like what?

01:19:49.230 --> 01:19:52.654
That I haven't felt connected
to anyone I've flirted with

01:19:52.754 --> 01:19:55.657
or casually seen or dated
or slept with for years,

01:19:55.757 --> 01:19:57.859
for I don't know how long.

01:19:57.959 --> 01:20:02.954
That this was a rare deal.
That right now I'm aware looking at you,

01:20:03.254 --> 01:20:05.265
this could be it for me.

01:20:14.375 --> 01:20:16.211
I never anticipated
still having to find a place

01:20:16.311 --> 01:20:18.247
where I'd fit in by the time
I was an adult either.

01:20:18.347 --> 01:20:23.283
I thought you automatically got one
once you had a job and a family.

01:20:24.185 --> 01:20:27.721
But it's just you, alone.

01:20:53.681 --> 01:20:55.851
Thanks for coming.

01:20:56.451 --> 01:21:00.589
Hey, no problem. I'm happy to.

01:21:00.689 --> 01:21:02.224
Do you want to tell me what happened?

01:21:02.324 --> 01:21:06.128
No, nothing. It was a mix-up.
They're not pressing charges.

01:21:06.228 --> 01:21:08.562
Good. Good.

01:21:09.230 --> 01:21:11.734
- Listen, honey. I...
- Dad, no, I...

01:21:11.834 --> 01:21:14.603
I need you to know
that I fucked up, too.

01:21:14.703 --> 01:21:17.807
So I'm in no position to judge you.

01:21:18.607 --> 01:21:21.443
What are you talking about?
You can totally judge me.

01:21:21.543 --> 01:21:23.745
I did something really stupid.

01:21:23.845 --> 01:21:28.684
And it's gonna take a long time before
your mom can think well of me again.

01:21:28.784 --> 01:21:30.452
You told her?

01:21:30.552 --> 01:21:33.088
Yeah. I wasn't going anyplace.

01:21:33.188 --> 01:21:36.124
I just had a moment in time where...

01:21:36.224 --> 01:21:41.252
you know, I lost sight of who I was
and what was important to me.

01:21:41.352 --> 01:21:43.765
So you're staying together?

01:21:43.865 --> 01:21:47.767
Yeah, we're gonna work on it.
She wants to work on it.

01:21:49.370 --> 01:21:51.273
Do you still think
you were just shifting?

01:21:51.373 --> 01:21:55.878
Well, that's what, you know,
relationships are, you know?

01:21:56.178 --> 01:22:00.816
Not the cheating part,
that was my problem.

01:22:00.916 --> 01:22:04.002
But you know, you don't just
get into one and then that's it.

01:22:04.102 --> 01:22:07.331
It's work, and it's always changing.
It's always changing.

01:22:09.257 --> 01:22:11.927
Yeah, I think I know what you mean.

01:22:12.257 --> 01:22:17.483
Look, I was just happy to hear from you.
Even if it was from jail.

01:22:57.138 --> 01:22:59.005
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:23:00.041 --> 01:23:01.551
Hey, baby.

01:23:04.845 --> 01:23:07.180
Welcome back.

01:23:11.252 --> 01:23:14.857
So I... checked the chapel's
photographer out.

01:23:15.357 --> 01:23:18.827
He's no me,
but he's done some okay work.

01:23:18.927 --> 01:23:21.163
I think we're gonna have to paste
in the Caribbean behind us

01:23:21.263 --> 01:23:24.664
so our parents think we went
further away and couldn't invite them.

01:23:26.868 --> 01:23:28.304
Who's that?

01:23:28.804 --> 01:23:31.347
- I don't know. I got it.
- All right.

01:23:34.575 --> 01:23:37.312
- Hey-o.
- Misty.

01:23:38.326 --> 01:23:39.715
Wh... What are you doing here?

01:23:40.115 --> 01:23:42.818
Well, I brought the stuff
you left behind from the crash.

01:23:43.018 --> 01:23:45.353
- Here.
- Oh, thanks.

01:23:45.453 --> 01:23:48.890
And by the way, Patrick's dad wants you
to pay for his car repairs out of pocket.

01:23:48.990 --> 01:23:52.627
Out of po... Oh, what...
Nobody does that unless it's a scratch.

01:23:52.727 --> 01:23:55.497
- Yeah, well, he's a dick.
- Oh, my God.

01:23:55.697 --> 01:23:57.299
Anywho...

01:23:58.099 --> 01:24:01.168
I'm also here to tell you
that you need to come to prom.

01:24:03.637 --> 01:24:06.008
- Misty, I can't.
- I know.

01:24:06.108 --> 01:24:08.310
You and Annika are having
a lot of issues right now.

01:24:08.410 --> 01:24:09.608
But if you stop being
friends after this,

01:24:09.708 --> 01:24:13.502
she's gonna become secretly tortured
about it. That's how she is.

01:24:13.602 --> 01:24:15.484
I know she looks up to you.

01:24:15.584 --> 01:24:18.620
That trip you got her to take
to her mom's was huge.

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:20.922
And all this time you've been
spending with us fucknuts.

01:24:21.022 --> 01:24:22.558
- Hey.
- Hey. Hi.

01:24:22.658 --> 01:24:26.128
- Who's this?
- I'm Misty.

01:24:26.328 --> 01:24:29.538
- Hey, Misty.
- Yeah. Megan's been mentoring me.

01:24:29.965 --> 01:24:33.201
Right. At the seminar,
she was in the junior program.

01:24:33.301 --> 01:24:35.770
- The junior program.
- Oh, wow, that's cool.

01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:37.533
What was your animal?

01:24:39.106 --> 01:24:40.733
I'm my own animal.

01:24:43.078 --> 01:24:45.414
- Right. I like that. I respect that.
- Yeah.

01:24:45.514 --> 01:24:48.349
- Okay. Nice meeting you.
- All right, you too.

01:24:50.250 --> 01:24:53.178
- He's cute.
- Thanks.

01:24:53.588 --> 01:24:55.923
Well, we bought you
a ticket as Patrick's date.

01:24:59.827 --> 01:25:00.752
Just come.

01:25:33.260 --> 01:25:34.429
Attention, passengers.

01:25:34.529 --> 01:25:38.300
Flight 514 has begun
general boarding to Las Vegas.

01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:42.075
- Please, line up to the right of the podium...
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:25:42.175 --> 01:25:44.658
- Here we go.
- Okay.

01:25:45.158 --> 01:25:48.376
Wait. Hold on a second.
I know it's going to be bad quality.

01:25:48.476 --> 01:25:52.278
- But I need to capture this moment.
- Right. Of course. Of course.

01:25:55.016 --> 01:25:56.818
All right. Just gonna
send this to the group.

01:25:56.918 --> 01:25:59.888
They're over at the soft open
for the restaurant.

01:26:00.038 --> 01:26:02.524
We've got to celebrate with
those guys as soon as we get back.

01:26:02.624 --> 01:26:04.133
Why do you need to do that?

01:26:04.233 --> 01:26:06.840
I'm not gonna send it to our parents.
I know that's a whole other conversation.

01:26:08.130 --> 01:26:11.297
And... done.

01:26:13.634 --> 01:26:15.244
Why did you need to do that?

01:26:16.438 --> 01:26:21.187
Well, I figured 'cause they can't be here,
it's our way of bringing them into it.

01:26:22.244 --> 01:26:26.014
- Oh, look, Allison already wrote back.
- Oh, my God. I can't do this.

01:26:26.214 --> 01:26:29.451
What? Oh, are you thinking...

01:26:29.551 --> 01:26:32.587
You're thinking we need to have a
real wedding. I know, and you know what?

01:26:32.687 --> 01:26:34.890
That would actually make me
a whole lot more happy.

01:26:34.990 --> 01:26:39.973
No. No, I mean that
we can't be together.

01:26:44.164 --> 01:26:46.694
- Wait, what?
- Oh, my God...

01:26:47.469 --> 01:26:50.038
Oh, my God, I think I might...

01:26:50.138 --> 01:26:52.941
I think I might throw up
that I'm finally doing this.

01:26:53.541 --> 01:26:56.044
Doing what? What are you doing?

01:26:56.244 --> 01:26:57.705
Okay...

01:26:58.246 --> 01:27:01.026
How am I gonna explain
this to you, right?

01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:04.085
Right, the animal thing, right?
The animal thing, okay.

01:27:04.185 --> 01:27:06.288
God, Anthony.
That could never be my speed.

01:27:06.388 --> 01:27:09.424
But... But if it helps you to understand
what I'm trying to say to you,

01:27:09.824 --> 01:27:11.491
then...

01:27:13.694 --> 01:27:16.097
Anth, I'm a snake.

01:27:16.197 --> 01:27:20.335
I'm a snake that's been dragging
my old skin around with me

01:27:20.435 --> 01:27:23.212
for way too long.

01:27:23.312 --> 01:27:24.812
I'm a snake.

01:27:25.906 --> 01:27:27.844
- No, you're not.
- No, no.

01:27:28.643 --> 01:27:31.410
You have to see this about me.

01:27:33.413 --> 01:27:37.549
I'm dropping out.
I'm dropping out of the group.

01:27:39.787 --> 01:27:43.525
Okay, I mean, that's okay,
'cause that's them,

01:27:43.625 --> 01:27:46.378
and you can just cut down on the
amount of time you hang out with them...

01:27:46.478 --> 01:27:50.264
- 'cause that's just them. That's not us.
- No. No.

01:27:51.333 --> 01:27:53.867
No, you're still part of the group.

01:27:55.069 --> 01:27:56.700
You and me, we're...

01:27:57.122 --> 01:28:02.033
We're somewhere back there.
You know, we're in the past.

01:28:09.183 --> 01:28:11.517
Holy shit, Meg.

01:28:16.690 --> 01:28:20.214
- All this time?
- No, no, God, no.

01:28:21.695 --> 01:28:24.631
- Not all of it.
- Well, however long.

01:28:26.767 --> 01:28:29.135
Holy shit.

01:28:34.441 --> 01:28:36.311
This is it.

01:28:36.411 --> 01:28:38.920
- Yeah.
- This is what it comes down to.

01:28:40.614 --> 01:28:42.190
Yeah.

01:28:44.418 --> 01:28:46.633
Waking up in the morning,

01:28:46.733 --> 01:28:49.889
and never being able to see your face...

01:28:50.857 --> 01:28:51.726
Ever again.

01:28:51.826 --> 01:28:54.696
No, we can still be in each
other's lives, you know?

01:28:54.796 --> 01:28:56.863
We can still...

01:28:57.698 --> 01:28:59.366
We can still talk?

01:29:00.634 --> 01:29:02.484
Yeah.

01:29:02.884 --> 01:29:04.937
Yeah, right.

01:29:07.341 --> 01:29:09.408
Sure.

01:30:29.489 --> 01:30:30.303
Hey.

01:30:31.059 --> 01:30:34.615
Hey. You came.

01:30:36.897 --> 01:30:38.786
The smoky eye looks great.

01:30:40.067 --> 01:30:41.841
Thanks.

01:30:47.908 --> 01:30:52.544
Okay, what I did to your
dad was wrong. But...

01:30:53.847 --> 01:30:56.315
I just really, really fell for him.

01:30:58.018 --> 01:31:01.337
Annika... I've broken up
with my boyfriend.

01:31:06.026 --> 01:31:07.897
Yeah, well...

01:31:09.197 --> 01:31:10.832
I guess I know what it's
like to forget yourself

01:31:10.932 --> 01:31:13.393
when you really, really like someone.

01:31:17.955 --> 01:31:20.587
Okay, I'm gonna tell you two things
that I've gotten some perspective on

01:31:20.687 --> 01:31:23.171
after being out of
high school for a while now.

01:31:23.411 --> 01:31:26.047
The first is that a lot of the math
they're teaching you

01:31:26.147 --> 01:31:28.850
that they swear you'll use
in your life, you won't.

01:31:29.050 --> 01:31:30.919
You're never going to
need to use parabolas

01:31:31.019 --> 01:31:35.323
and you really don't need to know shapes
that have more than eight fucking sides.

01:31:35.423 --> 01:31:36.945
The second...

01:31:38.492 --> 01:31:42.982
The second, which I've only got
some perspective on recently,

01:31:43.082 --> 01:31:45.174
but it's this.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:50.305
You can't keep putting aside what
you want for some imaginary future.

01:31:50.405 --> 01:31:52.642
You've just got to suck it
up and go with your gut.

01:31:53.942 --> 01:31:55.911
All right, guys. This is it.

01:31:56.311 --> 01:31:58.380
This is the last song of your prom.

01:31:58.980 --> 01:32:00.846
Make it good.

01:32:09.923 --> 01:32:11.657
You gonna sit here?

01:32:15.529 --> 01:32:17.130
All right.

01:32:18.098 --> 01:32:19.545
Fuck it. I'm gonna do it.

01:32:20.401 --> 01:32:21.922
Good.

01:32:25.239 --> 01:32:26.573
Hey.

01:32:28.452 --> 01:32:30.515
Excuse me.

01:32:31.711 --> 01:32:33.949
I wanted to tell you,

01:32:34.349 --> 01:32:38.660
I have serious feelings for you.
And I would like to cut in.

01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:40.886
And also...

01:32:42.055 --> 01:32:44.158
Junior, I'd like to be your girlfriend.

01:32:45.326 --> 01:32:48.455
So you're saying that you
want to try and be together?

01:32:50.098 --> 01:32:51.732
Yeah.

01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:54.359
Okay.

01:32:54.891 --> 01:32:57.854
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:34:46.613 --> 01:34:49.317
So... Did you hear the one
about the grown woman

01:34:49.417 --> 01:34:52.855
who fell in love with the
really pissed off lawyer?

01:34:56.990 --> 01:35:00.459
- Is it funny?
- It's really funny.

01:35:02.929 --> 01:35:04.764
Come here.

01:35:06.983 --> 01:35:08.734
Close the door.
