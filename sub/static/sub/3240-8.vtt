Same thing <i>everybody</i> says --
that she didn't do it.

20:44.244 --> 20:47.111
I'm inclined
to believe her.

20:47.113 --> 20:48.679
A woman who beats people
for a living?

20:48.681 --> 20:50.915
And I dismember
dead bodies.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.116
Meaning?

20:52.118 --> 20:54.318
That though our occupations
are unusual,

20:54.320 --> 20:55.886
We're both professionals.

20:55.888 --> 21:00.224
You want to know what iona did
before she became a dom?

21:00.226 --> 21:01.726
She was a therapist.

21:01.728 --> 21:03.694
You want to know
how she lost her license?

21:03.696 --> 21:06.330
She had an affair
with one of her patients --

21:06.332 --> 21:07.698
Joseph briggs.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.200
When iona tried
to break it off with him,

21:09.202 --> 21:10.935
He killed himself.

21:10.937 --> 21:12.236
Now, I'm not saying

21:12.238 --> 21:14.071
That she tried
to kill either of them,

21:14.073 --> 21:17.708
But clearly she has a history
of crossing lines.

21:25.684 --> 21:27.485
What would you like me
to call you --

21:27.487 --> 21:29.620
Iona or molly?

21:29.622 --> 21:32.790
I suppose "mistress payne"
is out of the question.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.091
[ sighs ]

21:34.093 --> 21:35.626
Well,
look at the bright side.

21:35.628 --> 21:37.762
At least <i>one</i> of us
ended up in handcuffs.

21:37.764 --> 21:40.131
They really are gonna charge me
with richard's murder,

21:40.133 --> 21:41.365
Aren't they?

21:41.367 --> 21:42.867
It's not looking good.

21:42.869 --> 21:46.504
The incident
with your former patient

21:46.506 --> 21:48.706
Joseph briggs...

21:49.841 --> 21:51.809
...You want to tell me
about it?

21:53.111 --> 21:54.812
Yeah.

21:54.814 --> 21:58.049
Yeah, I mean,
it was simple.

21:58.051 --> 21:59.850
I got too close.

21:59.852 --> 22:02.753
I knew better,
but I was 27 years old,

22:02.755 --> 22:07.658
And so I let myself fall in love
with a deeply troubled man.

22:07.660 --> 22:11.329
I did learn my lesson about
getting involved with patients.

22:11.331 --> 22:13.364
So you
and richard gain--

22:13.366 --> 22:14.865
No.

22:14.867 --> 22:18.569
Besides, he wasn't even my type.
I prefer the lone wolves.

22:20.605 --> 22:22.873
If you give me the name
of the client you were with

22:22.875 --> 22:25.543
At the time of richard's death,
I can confirm your alibi.

22:25.545 --> 22:26.877
You know I can't do that.

22:26.879 --> 22:28.079
I respect your scruples,

22:28.081 --> 22:30.915
But protecting a man's anonymity
isn't worth prison.

22:30.917 --> 22:35.086
Most people think my job is
about what I do to my clients.

22:35.088 --> 22:36.821
It's what I <i>don't</i> do.

22:36.823 --> 22:39.090
I bring them
right to the edge,

22:39.092 --> 22:42.426
And in that moment where
they are completely vulnerable

22:42.428 --> 22:45.796
And I can do anything I want
to them...

22:45.798 --> 22:47.064
I stop.

22:49.134 --> 22:51.168
It's ironic, isn't it?

22:51.170 --> 22:53.104
Uh, what's that?

22:53.106 --> 22:56.107
That the only way
you can truly feel alive

22:56.109 --> 23:00.878
Is to give another person
the power to destroy you.

23:02.347 --> 23:03.748
Are you ever
going to tell me

23:03.750 --> 23:06.150
What happened to you
on that ship?

23:08.420 --> 23:10.855
Not if I can help it.

your tongue, henry morgan.

23:18.296 --> 23:21.165
So,
why won't you tell me?

23:23.402 --> 23:25.770
Because
you won't believe me.

23:27.572 --> 23:30.708
I can hardly believe it
<i>myself</i> sometimes.

You can tell me

got to open the store.

24:19.992 --> 24:21.959
The guy who's got to work
for a living,

Thanks to
his two divorces --

24:23.629 --> 24:26.730
Which were worth

just wondering

24:46.853 --> 24:49.420
If there was something better
around the corner.

24:49.422 --> 24:50.988
Then I figured it out.

older, the better.

41:28.820 --> 41:30.019
Got it.

41:34.325 --> 41:35.792
When you asked
about my scar,

41:35.794 --> 41:37.627
The reason I didn't tell you
was --

41:37.629 --> 41:38.862
No, listen, I'm sorry.

41:38.864 --> 41:40.864
I didn't --
I didn't mean to pry.

41:41.632 --> 41:43.366
No, it's...

41:43.368 --> 41:45.969
I want you
to know the story.

41:48.439 --> 41:49.906
I was shot.

41:51.642 --> 41:54.978
Shut the front door!

41:54.980 --> 41:55.912
[ laughs ]

41:55.914 --> 41:57.380
He's here!
Look at that!

41:57.382 --> 41:58.882
Oh! Aah!

41:58.884 --> 42:00.817
Sorry. I totally just violated
your personal space.

42:00.819 --> 42:03.052
One might argue
that was long overdue.

42:03.054 --> 42:04.721
Of course,
one would be wrong.

42:04.723 --> 42:07.390
And here's your little
fancy-pants drink, doc.

42:07.392 --> 42:11.594
Oh! Henry morgan having a drink
with the old gang?

42:11.596 --> 42:13.396
Never thought
I'd live to see the day.

42:13.398 --> 42:17.600
Well, you live long enough,
<i>anything</i> is possible.

42:17.602 --> 42:18.668
Cheers to that,
right?

42:18.670 --> 42:19.669
[ laughter ]

42:19.671 --> 42:21.504
Cheers.
Absolutely.

42:21.506 --> 42:23.907
Hey, you're behind.
Drink that up.

42:23.909 --> 42:25.808
Come on.
We're three in at this point.
