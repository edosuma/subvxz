00:33.190 --> 00:34.211
Give me the money.

00:34.211 --> 00:35.753
Let's go. Come on, 
come on, hurry up.

00:35.753 --> 00:37.555
You do what I say,
you're not gonna get hurt.

00:37.555 --> 00:39.151
–Go, come on.
–Okay, okay.

00:40.478 --> 00:42.098
Come on, come on, let's go.

01:35.147 --> 01:36.463
I should go.

01:37.590 --> 01:39.451
Why?

01:39.451 --> 01:42.024
Because it's 5:00 A.M.

01:42.310 --> 01:44.767
I really should go.

01:45.560 --> 01:47.742
Early meeting?

01:48.021 --> 01:49.278
I need…

01:54.199 --> 01:56.583
I need to go home.

01:56.583 --> 01:58.744
I need to change my clothes.

01:59.750 --> 02:03.006
I need to check my mail.

02:03.452 --> 02:07.101
I need to feed my cat.

02:09.417 --> 02:11.795
I'm gonna be so late for work.

02:11.795 --> 02:13.600
I'll write you a note.

02:38.429 --> 02:40.109
–Good morning.
–You're late.

02:40.456 --> 02:42.021
Missed morning roll call, did I?

02:42.021 --> 02:44.348
We had the Satchik
deposition at 9:00.

02:44.348 --> 02:45.826
Oh, God, Lori, forgive me.

02:45.826 --> 02:48.231
I called you three or four times.
Where were you?

02:48.231 --> 02:51.293
In the shower.

02:51.293 --> 02:53.238
New shampoo?

02:54.626 --> 02:57.566
–Excuse me?
–Your hair smells a little different.

02:57.847 --> 03:02.553
I'm always on the lookout for a new conditioner, 
so I'm a bit of a serial hair sniffer.

03:02.553 --> 03:04.371
I, I use, um,

03:04.371 --> 03:07.732
several different shampoos.
I'm not sure which one I used today.

03:07.732 --> 03:09.001
Anything else?

03:09.001 --> 03:10.409
No.

03:10.875 --> 03:13.023
I like this jacket.

03:14.129 --> 03:16.545
I liked it more yesterday.

03:17.094 --> 03:20.756
Good morning.
Tara, looking even lovelier than ever.

03:20.756 --> 03:22.374
Lori, looking…

03:22.374 --> 03:23.961
at your watch.

03:32.771 --> 03:34.220
It's Lori Colson.

03:34.220 --> 03:37.684
Lori. Hey, it's me.
It's Michael Shea.

03:37.684 --> 03:39.904
Michael, what's wrong?
Where are you?

03:41.373 --> 03:43.761
Listen, I'm at Boston General.

03:43.761 --> 03:46.166
<i>I'm in the emergency room.</i> I got…

03:46.166 --> 03:47.904
somebody shot me.
–What?

03:47.904 --> 03:49.908
<i>Listen, I'm gonna explain 
to you when you get here, but</i>

03:49.908 --> 03:52.355
could you just please hurry?

03:52.605 --> 03:56.151
There's cops all over the place. I think 
one of the doctors must've called them,

03:56.151 --> 03:57.441
but they're asking me
<i>all sorts of questions.</i>

03:57.441 --> 03:59.470
<i>–Could you just hurry?</i>
–Okay, look, don't say anything.

03:59.470 --> 04:01.570
I'm on my way.
I'll be right there.

04:45.284 --> 04:46.449
Help you?

04:46.449 --> 04:48.053
I need to see Michael Shea.

04:48.053 --> 04:49.943
–You family? 
–I'm his attorney.

04:49.943 --> 04:52.270
I understand you've been
questioning my client.

04:52.270 --> 04:53.698
Take it up with the A.D.A.

04:53.698 --> 04:55.433
Lori Colson.

04:55.433 --> 04:56.625
So it is true.

04:56.625 --> 04:59.272
–You've switched to the dark side.
–Mark, where's Michael Shea?

04:59.272 --> 05:02.854
Mr Shea is indisposed at the moment.
Genius got himself shot in the chest.

05:02.854 --> 05:05.428
He called me less than 10 minutes ago.
He asked for counsel.

05:05.428 --> 05:07.308
–He didn't ask me.
–Are you charging him?

05:07.308 --> 05:08.388
Not yet.

05:08.388 --> 05:10.644
–We're still investigating.
–Investigating what?

05:10.644 --> 05:13.114
–I don't need to tell you that.
–If he's not arrested, I can see him.

05:13.114 --> 05:15.275
I don't need to tell you that.

05:16.105 --> 05:18.086
Well, look, your client's 
on his way to surgery right now.

05:18.086 --> 05:20.904
You're welcome to see him
as soon as he's out.

05:23.112 --> 05:24.138
Michael!

05:24.138 --> 05:25.736
Michael Shea, can you hear me?

05:25.736 --> 05:27.577
Lori? That's my lawyer right there.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.324
Hey, could you let her in, please?

05:29.324 --> 05:32.204
You heard him, Mark.
These people are witnesses.

05:37.979 --> 05:39.156
Lori.

05:39.156 --> 05:40.698
Can you give us a minute?

05:40.861 --> 05:42.088
Yeah.

05:46.717 --> 05:49.627
–Michael, what is going on?
–I didn't do anything, okay?

05:49.627 --> 05:51.556
You got shot, Michael.
The police are here.

05:51.556 --> 05:54.351
Lori, I was walking home,
a guy comes out of nowhere.

05:54.351 --> 05:57.360
I just, I didn't wanna
give up my money.

05:57.360 --> 05:58.702
–He shot me.
–Michael,

05:58.702 --> 06:00.447
the police think
you're a suspect, not a victim.

06:00.447 --> 06:02.459
If you did something, look at me.

06:03.794 --> 06:06.004
I need you to tell me the truth.

06:06.004 --> 06:09.669
Lori, I didn't do anything, okay?

06:09.669 --> 06:11.753
I swear.

06:28.112 --> 06:31.713
Docket ending 477,
People versus Walter Mack.

06:31.713 --> 06:34.098
Your honor, while this case
is marked for trial,

06:34.098 --> 06:36.560
in fact, the defendant
would like to accept a plea.

06:36.560 --> 06:37.768
Is that so?

06:37.768 --> 06:39.771
The people have offered
reckless endangerment.

06:39.771 --> 06:41.900
In exchange, 
we'd recommend probation.

06:41.900 --> 06:44.066
That's a reduced charge.
You're aware of that?

06:44.066 --> 06:45.894
Yes, your honor.

06:46.132 --> 06:48.327
Up here, both of you.

06:53.039 --> 06:54.499
I don't like this.

06:54.499 --> 06:58.110
Your office gets behind
so you just let criminals walk?

06:58.110 --> 07:00.837
It's reassuring to see that you 
haven't formed any conclusions

07:00.837 --> 07:03.342
about my client's guilt or innocence.

07:03.342 --> 07:04.971
You know what 
my mother always says?

07:04.971 --> 07:07.872
“If it smells funny,
I'm not eating it.”

07:07.872 --> 07:11.172
Exact opposite of my motto.

07:11.554 --> 07:14.021
–This deal smells funny.
–If I may, your honor,

07:14.021 --> 07:16.749
the object here is to enhance
the quality of life

07:16.749 --> 07:20.602
for the tenants in Mr Mack's building,
and he is prepared to make considerable…

07:20.602 --> 07:24.457
No, the object here to send a message
to every landlord in Boston,

07:24.457 --> 07:27.712
treat people like animals,
we will cage you like one.

07:29.278 --> 07:33.423
I don't mean to pry, your honor,
but is everything okay at home?

07:33.423 --> 07:35.367
Step back, both of you.

07:40.915 --> 07:42.393
Mr Mack,

07:43.225 --> 07:45.287
I'll accept your plea
under one condition.

07:45.287 --> 07:47.635
You are to build a sign
to be worn around your neck,

07:47.635 --> 07:50.546
said sign to read,
“I am a slumlord”

07:50.546 --> 07:52.145
because, sir, that's what you are.

07:52.145 --> 07:54.782
Judge, you don't know
what I'm up against.

07:54.782 --> 07:56.767
The elevator in 
the Green street building,

07:56.767 --> 07:59.820
some kids blew up 
the electrical system just for fun.

07:59.820 --> 08:03.917
I paint over their graffiti,
it's back that day.

08:03.917 --> 08:06.620
I'm doing the best I can,
truly I am.

08:06.620 --> 08:09.182
You are to stand in front
of your Green street property

08:09.182 --> 08:11.909
wearing said sign for no less
than four continuous hours.

08:11.909 --> 08:14.108
Your honor, I cannot allow
my client to be subjected

08:14.108 --> 08:18.215
to an extrajudicial penalty
whose only purpose is to humiliate.

08:18.215 --> 08:19.962
Well, get used to it, Mr Shore.

08:19.962 --> 08:21.223
This is nothing new.

08:21.223 --> 08:23.641
From the top of my head,
I can remember the case of a woman

08:23.641 --> 08:26.175
who didn't strap 
her daughter into a car seat.

08:26.175 --> 08:29.068
The judge made her write
a mock obituary for the child.

08:29.068 --> 08:32.744
A drunk-driving defendant was forced 
to put a warning sign on his car.

08:32.744 --> 08:36.105
A woman was ordered to place 
an ad in the paper admitting

08:36.105 --> 08:37.809
that she had bought drugs.

08:37.809 --> 08:39.183
Tell me,

08:39.183 --> 08:42.812
when did it become wrong
to feel scorn for a criminal?

08:42.812 --> 08:44.622
This sentence goes 
beyond scorn, your honor,

08:44.622 --> 08:46.365
and I have known my client for years.

08:46.365 --> 08:47.566
He is not a criminal.

08:47.566 --> 08:50.568
I'm not at all interested
in your opinion, Mr Shore.

08:50.568 --> 08:51.890
You don't want the deal?

08:51.890 --> 08:53.018
Go to trial.

08:53.018 --> 08:54.615
But if you lose,

08:54.615 --> 08:58.539
your defendant will go to prison,
and deservedly so.

08:58.539 --> 09:00.791
Talk it over. 
You have 60 seconds.

09:12.935 --> 09:14.935
It's your call, Walter.

09:18.237 --> 09:19.699
I'll do it.

09:20.432 --> 09:22.847
In four hours, 
this will all be over.

09:32.793 --> 09:35.171
He says he got jumped 
on the way home.

09:35.540 --> 09:36.861
You believe him?

09:36.861 --> 09:38.784
I have no reason not to.

09:39.635 --> 09:41.787
Look, we had a robbery 
a few blocks away,

09:41.787 --> 09:43.041
guy wearing a ski mask.

09:43.041 --> 09:45.567
Owner gets a shot off,
hits the guy in the chest.

09:45.567 --> 09:48.217
11 minutes later, 
your guy shows up here.

09:48.217 --> 09:51.881
So did two other gunshot victims
within the same 20-minute time frame,

09:51.881 --> 09:53.583
both young males. I asked.

09:53.583 --> 09:55.209
Michael Shea doesn't do stickups.

09:55.209 --> 09:56.717
You don't know that.

09:56.717 --> 09:59.732
We ran his raps.
Prior assault, gun possession.

10:01.722 --> 10:03.704
Can I talk to you for a minute?

10:04.658 --> 10:06.077
Yeah.

10:07.508 --> 10:09.426
Okay, look, I know this guy.

10:09.426 --> 10:12.002
We flipped him on that receiving case.

10:12.002 --> 10:13.951
–He was your informant?
–Yes, for over a year.

10:13.951 --> 10:17.671
He was a big help to us, Mark.
I don't think he would do this.

10:18.908 --> 10:20.950
Well, we're gonna 
know soon enough.

10:20.950 --> 10:22.436
Meaning what?

10:22.436 --> 10:23.922
The hospital's under court order.

10:23.922 --> 10:25.819
When that bullet comes out,
it goes to our lab.

10:25.819 --> 10:28.462
If the slug matches
the store owner's gun,

10:28.462 --> 10:29.844
he's guilty.

10:43.389 --> 10:45.391
You look upset.
I can tell these things.

10:45.391 --> 10:46.904
I'm a people person.

10:46.904 --> 10:49.335
Ever appear before a raving
loon named Clark Brown?

10:49.335 --> 10:51.178
Many a time.

10:51.178 --> 10:52.731
Raving Loon.

10:52.860 --> 10:54.822
70 years old, still lives 
with his mother.

10:54.822 --> 10:56.319
What'd he do to tick you off?

10:56.319 --> 11:00.105
Humiliated a client for reasons
of pure bile and sport.

11:00.105 --> 11:02.158
Said there was a precedent for it.

11:02.158 --> 11:06.527
Cited a bunch of cases where 
the judges shamed the defendant.

11:06.527 --> 11:08.011
Right. How'd you know?

11:08.011 --> 11:11.043
Because the judge in all those cases…

11:11.043 --> 11:12.385
Judge Brown.

11:12.385 --> 11:14.696
Raving Loon.

11:17.639 --> 11:19.486
They want the bullet?

11:19.486 --> 11:23.222
That's why they're here, so they can 
match it against the store owner's gun.

11:23.222 --> 11:25.303
I don't feel so good.

11:25.426 --> 11:28.963
Will it match, Michael?
What exactly am I dealing with here?

11:28.963 --> 11:30.881
You're a lucky man, Mr Shea.

11:30.881 --> 11:34.762
If that shot were 6 inches lower,
I'd be talking to a corpse.

11:35.694 --> 11:37.057
So, I'm not dying?

11:37.057 --> 11:38.875
No. You're stable.

11:38.875 --> 11:42.240
Once we remove the bullet,
you'll be fine.

11:42.976 --> 11:44.776
What if you don't?

11:44.776 --> 11:46.275
Don't what?

11:46.275 --> 11:48.081
If you don't remove it.

11:48.081 --> 11:50.258
You just said I'm stable, right?

11:50.258 --> 11:54.818
For now, but that bullet could 
puncture your heart wall, Mr Shea.

11:54.818 --> 11:57.175
Okay, well, I think I'll risk it.

11:57.175 --> 11:59.408
What do you mean, you'll risk it?

11:59.972 --> 12:02.109
I need a moment with my client.

12:02.109 --> 12:05.949
–We have to get him up to surgery.
–One quick moment. Thank you.

12:08.182 --> 12:10.228
Okay, I'm sorry.

12:10.228 --> 12:12.145
–I screwed up. It's big.
–Michael…

12:12.145 --> 12:14.690
Lori, you know my record.
I'm on probation.

12:14.690 --> 12:18.770
They get me for this, I'm going 
to go back. It's gonna be 30 years.

12:18.787 --> 12:23.032
We're out of time.
This removal isn't optional.

12:23.956 --> 12:25.340
For us it is.

12:25.340 --> 12:26.459
Step back, please.

12:26.459 --> 12:28.756
My client doesn't 
consent to this procedure,

12:28.756 --> 12:30.292
and if you ignore his wishes,

12:30.292 --> 12:34.334
I'm afraid the consequences could be 
significant for this hospital and you personally.

12:34.334 --> 12:36.255
–You can't be serious.
–Try me.

12:36.255 --> 12:39.615
You can patch him up,
but that bullet stays where it is.

12:58.483 --> 13:00.669
I mean, it's a balancing test, right?

13:00.669 --> 13:04.219
Legitimate state interest in recovering 
probative felony case evidence

13:04.219 --> 13:07.558
versus the right to refuse
invasive and potentially deadly surgery.

13:07.558 --> 13:10.244
I can argue it, maybe even win.

13:10.684 --> 13:11.793
But?

13:11.793 --> 13:14.551
But am I supposed to use 
all of my legal skills

13:14.551 --> 13:17.270
so Michael Shea can leave a bullet 
in his body and die from it?

13:17.270 --> 13:20.440
Now, the doctor didn't say
he would necessarily die, right?

13:20.440 --> 13:24.067
He said the bullet could 
puncture the heart wall.

13:24.258 --> 13:26.223
What are you saying,
that it's all right to walk around

13:26.223 --> 13:28.366
with a 9-millimeter slug in your chest?

13:28.366 --> 13:34.560
Well, as you know, my personal policy is always 
to remove bullets immediately after I'm shot.

13:34.820 --> 13:36.612
Lori,

13:36.612 --> 13:39.291
is your client competent?

13:39.291 --> 13:43.362
I suppose. —Is he being clear in 
communicating his wishes to you?

13:43.362 --> 13:44.300
Yes.

13:44.300 --> 13:48.379
Have you vigorously presented
alternative courses to him?

13:48.379 --> 13:50.493
Paul, I've done all of those things.

13:50.493 --> 13:52.953
Legally, I'm covered.

13:53.956 --> 13:55.889
Am I doing the right thing?

13:55.889 --> 13:59.460
You're doing what your client wants
within the bounds of the law.

13:59.460 --> 14:01.117
End of inquiry.

14:08.150 --> 14:09.962
Oh, Tara.

14:10.163 --> 14:11.797
There you are.
Listen, I need some help.

14:11.797 --> 14:12.958
I just e-mailed you.

14:12.958 --> 14:15.466
I went through the transcript
and found at least seven places

14:15.466 --> 14:17.441
where Satchik had 
misrepresented himself.

14:17.441 --> 14:18.532
Oh, no, new case.

14:18.532 --> 14:20.891
My client has a bullet in his 
chest and doesn't want it out.

14:20.891 --> 14:22.839
The D.A. will be arguing it's 
reasonable search.

14:22.839 --> 14:25.152
We need to show otherwise.

14:25.527 --> 14:29.073
There's a bullet in his chest,
and he doesn't want it out.

14:29.073 --> 14:32.015
It ties him to a crime 
and 30 years of prison.

14:33.337 --> 14:35.371
As soon as you can.

14:44.339 --> 14:48.490
Again, Mr Mack, I'm here as 
a court officer to verify your compliance.

14:48.490 --> 14:52.805
As you know, it is judge Brown's order
that you are to walk a distance of 50 feet,

14:52.805 --> 14:58.422
turn, retrace your steps, and 
turn again, and so forth, for four hours.

14:58.567 --> 15:01.106
–Do you understand?
–I understand.

15:10.853 --> 15:12.648
No.

15:12.952 --> 15:14.713
Oh, ain't that cute.

15:14.713 --> 15:16.521
Yeah.

15:16.815 --> 15:19.020
Tell us something we don't know.

15:19.318 --> 15:21.506
Hey, take a look at this.

15:21.506 --> 15:23.045
Hey, you know who that is?

15:23.045 --> 15:24.699
That's Walter Mack.

15:24.699 --> 15:26.507
Looking good, Walt!

15:26.954 --> 15:28.466
Nice sign!

15:28.466 --> 15:30.119
You sporting it, bro!

15:32.271 --> 15:33.804
Put a little something-something in it.

15:33.804 --> 15:36.723
Come on, smile, Walter!

15:42.151 --> 15:45.001
Ooh, that evil look.

15:45.751 --> 15:47.736
Sidney Poitier wannabe.

15:51.197 --> 15:53.587
We need the bullet, your honor.
We can't prove our case without it,

15:53.587 --> 15:56.216
–and we're entitled to retrieve it.
–Retrieve it?

15:56.216 --> 15:57.207
Nice euphemism.

15:57.207 --> 15:59.901
Judge, they want to take a knife
and slice open my client.

15:59.901 --> 16:02.316
–This is a patently unreasonable search.
–It is not unreasonable.

16:02.316 --> 16:05.420
Read the cases.
The court has to apply a balancing test.

16:05.420 --> 16:07.796
What exactly am 
I balancing, Mr Wells?

16:07.796 --> 16:10.692
The, uh, risk in 
intrusion to the defendant

16:10.692 --> 16:12.677
against society's interest
in solving this crime.

16:12.677 --> 16:15.971
The risks, your honor, are significant.
We're talking about cutting the skin,

16:15.971 --> 16:18.162
extensive probing, 
retracting the tissue.

16:18.162 --> 16:20.111
Come on. 
You have the doctor's statement.

16:20.111 --> 16:22.480
In his words, 
this is a simple procedure.

16:22.480 --> 16:23.852
You must admit, Miss Colson,

16:23.852 --> 16:26.931
the law doesn't protect
defendants from all intrusions.

16:26.931 --> 16:30.903
The state can, for example,
take blood from a drunk-driving suspect.

16:30.903 --> 16:33.490
Taking blood is a minor intrusion.

16:33.490 --> 16:35.877
This is a surgery 
under general anesthesia,

16:35.877 --> 16:38.088
where there are tangible,
foreseeable risks.

16:38.088 --> 16:40.476
Cardiac arrest, hypocapnia,
hypotension…

16:40.476 --> 16:43.624
Yeah, all of which are 
hypothetical at best.

16:43.624 --> 16:46.387
Look at the statistics.
He is not in danger.

16:46.387 --> 16:48.267
Your honor, this is over the line.

16:48.267 --> 16:50.090
They want to drug my client
until he's unconscious,

16:50.090 --> 16:51.226
then they want to cut him open.

16:51.226 --> 16:53.223
It's a small incision,
recovery is minimal.

16:53.223 --> 16:55.346
If we can force people
onto an operating table

16:55.346 --> 17:00.045
so the state can control for evidence,
the Fourth amendment means nothing.

17:00.045 --> 17:02.685
Sit. Sit.

17:03.696 --> 17:06.240
Mr Wells, other than this bullet,

17:06.240 --> 17:10.318
do you have anything at all
to connect Mr Shea to this crime?

17:10.318 --> 17:11.760
Uh, no, your honor, but this 
entire line of argument…

17:11.760 --> 17:14.320
Well, I suppose
I could find probable cause

17:14.320 --> 17:17.778
based solely on the nature and 
timing of Mr Shea's wound,

17:17.778 --> 17:20.269
–but that wouldn't be enough here.
–If I could just be heard…

17:20.269 --> 17:23.515
You were heard.
The depth and location of the wound,

17:23.515 --> 17:27.404
the use of general anesthesia,
the potential for nerve damage,

17:27.404 --> 17:32.215
cardiac arrest, however small,
the risks are real.

17:32.367 --> 17:35.509
I find that kind of 
intrusion unreasonable.

17:50.691 --> 17:52.988
What's wrong?
What happened?

17:53.084 --> 17:54.820
There's nothing wrong.

17:54.820 --> 17:58.158
Denny, you're sitting in a jail cell.
Something has happened,

17:58.158 --> 18:00.721
and something is wrong.

18:08.840 --> 18:12.046
I have been arrested for solicitation.

18:20.325 --> 18:22.781
You know, we got no hot water, Walter!

18:22.781 --> 18:24.887
My mother's 83 years old!

18:24.887 --> 18:27.896
For a solid week, she had to 
walk six flights to go outside!

18:27.896 --> 18:29.434
What do I do?

18:29.434 --> 18:34.450
Okay, okay, folks, why don't we all just take 
a step back and give the man some room?

18:34.450 --> 18:37.358
–Alan, it's Walter Mack.
–Oh, he's calling somebody.

18:37.358 --> 18:40.158
You got to help me out.
It's not safe out here.

18:40.158 --> 18:45.958
There are a couple of guys who look like gang 
members who said they were gonna Self-pump you!

18:49.400 --> 18:51.131
Nice shot!

18:53.117 --> 18:56.438
I need an ambulance.
142 green.

18:58.524 --> 19:00.521
Send the police now.

19:04.443 --> 19:06.204
Denny, I have an emergency 
of my own now.

19:06.204 --> 19:08.225
A client has been attacked.
I need to get going,

19:08.225 --> 19:12.545
so you have to tell me what has happened,
and you need to do so quickly.

19:16.529 --> 19:18.913
Denny, please.

19:23.101 --> 19:26.295
There are two things I hoped
to experience in my lifetime

19:26.295 --> 19:28.776
that I was sure I never would.

19:28.928 --> 19:31.209
The first was the Red Sox 
winning the world series.

19:31.209 --> 19:35.921
Then when that happened, I thought, 
“by God, I should experience the other.”

19:35.921 --> 19:37.256
The other being a hooker.

19:37.256 --> 19:38.473
No.

19:38.473 --> 19:40.844
I didn't know she was a prostitute.

19:40.844 --> 19:44.019
The other was sex with 
a one-legged woman.

19:45.062 --> 19:47.140
I beg your pardon?

19:47.558 --> 19:50.623
My father, God rest his soul,

19:50.623 --> 19:55.486
told me the best sex he ever had
was with one-legged women.

19:55.603 --> 19:59.112
Something about positional play.

19:59.112 --> 20:01.790
I always wondered.

20:01.879 --> 20:05.604
So there I was, driving down 
the street, and I saw her.

20:05.724 --> 20:10.635
A woman with long, flowing hair
and an incredible, magnificent…

20:10.635 --> 20:12.592
limp.

20:12.592 --> 20:14.294
So I pulled the car over.

20:14.294 --> 20:16.991
I said, “excuse me, ma'am,

20:17.922 --> 20:20.800
do you have a wooden leg?”

20:20.800 --> 20:24.654
She said, “why, do you
have one at the moment?”

20:24.804 --> 20:26.493
I smiled, and I said,
“matter of fact…”

20:26.493 --> 20:29.721
and she said, “I'm expensive.”

20:29.721 --> 20:36.148
So I told her I'd buy her 
a trip to Belize, first class.

20:36.732 --> 20:39.861
She pulled out her badge
and arrested me.

20:40.956 --> 20:43.141
Both her legs were real.

20:52.708 --> 20:54.876
You thought she had one leg.

20:54.876 --> 20:57.390
A trip to Belize is a fair 
and square deal, Bill.

20:57.390 --> 21:03.301
Hell, if I had a nickel for every woman
I promised to marry in exchange for sex…

21:03.301 --> 21:05.270
actually, I do.

21:05.270 --> 21:07.138
I'm supposed to believe this?

21:07.138 --> 21:12.144
Your father told you the best 
sex was to be had with amputees,

21:12.144 --> 21:17.523
you saw this woman limping,
and you were simply overcome?

21:17.523 --> 21:21.071
You're leaving out the most
important factor, your honor.

21:21.071 --> 21:23.513
–Which is?
–The Red Sox.

21:23.513 --> 21:26.783
For years, many years, they have,

21:26.783 --> 21:32.153
at one time or another, made each 
and every one of us insane.

21:32.153 --> 21:35.415
Last October, when they lost
the seventh game to the Yankees,

21:35.415 --> 21:37.255
crime went up in this city.

21:37.255 --> 21:41.565
It's already been predicted
we'll have a flood of August babies next year

21:41.565 --> 21:44.359
from celebration-induced pregnancies.

21:44.359 --> 21:48.344
The Red Sox make us lose ourselves,

21:48.344 --> 21:51.771
and in the wake of 
that team giving us what

21:51.771 --> 21:56.535
our hearts have yearned for all our lives, 
our parents and grandparents' lives,

21:56.535 --> 22:03.692
we have fallen victim to a delirium
that makes us believe anything,

22:03.692 --> 22:08.075
anything is possible,
including, but not limited to,

22:08.075 --> 22:15.404
the notion that God put a fetching 
one-legged woman in this man's path

22:15.404 --> 22:21.807
to commemorate the end of 
a wretched, horrid curse.

22:26.175 --> 22:27.933
You know me, Bill.

22:27.933 --> 22:31.431
I have hookers all the time.
They come to my house.

22:31.431 --> 22:35.416
Why would I pull over
to the side of the road?

22:38.847 --> 22:40.963
Go. Beat it.

22:40.963 --> 22:42.460
Thank you, sir.

22:42.608 --> 22:43.990
Buy you a drink, counsel?

22:43.990 --> 22:49.573
I'd love to, but I have to tend to some 
business with a much less reasonable judge.

22:49.908 --> 22:51.533
Thank you, Bill.

22:52.185 --> 22:53.640
Who's your daddy?

23:06.858 --> 23:09.969
So, uh, I'm not under arrest.

23:09.969 --> 23:14.155
No. Without the bullet, the D.A. 
doesn't have enough to charge you.

23:15.352 --> 23:17.560
Thanks.

23:18.655 --> 23:20.457
–Listen, Michael…
–Okay, wait, don't, don't,

23:20.457 --> 23:21.914
don't say it.

23:21.914 --> 23:23.618
You're disappointed in me.

23:23.618 --> 23:25.485
You think I don't get that?

23:25.934 --> 23:27.518
I'm sure you do, 
but I don't understand why…

23:27.518 --> 23:30.574
Look, I tried. Okay, Lori?

23:30.574 --> 23:32.074
Now, this might come 
as a shock to you,

23:32.074 --> 23:36.389
but there's no entry-level office 
training program for felons, okay?

23:36.389 --> 23:38.673
The only workout there for me 
is cleaning toilets,

23:38.673 --> 23:39.858
so if you're gonna lecture me now…

23:39.858 --> 23:42.032
I wasn't about to do that.

23:43.409 --> 23:45.720
–I just wanted to say that…
–What?

23:49.444 --> 23:52.192
I don't want you to die.

23:53.986 --> 23:57.307
I've known you for a long time,
and I like you.

23:59.180 --> 24:00.728
I don't want you to die.

24:21.616 --> 24:22.676
What are you doing now?

24:22.676 --> 24:25.421
Going to raise a ruckus.
Care to join me?

24:26.359 --> 24:28.532
No, thanks.

24:28.781 --> 24:30.383
You want something?

24:30.383 --> 24:31.841
Nothing.

24:33.045 --> 24:35.471
Tara, clearly you want something.

24:38.684 --> 24:41.269
I just came to tell you
that we won our motion,

24:41.269 --> 24:43.729
which is fabulous.

24:43.959 --> 24:47.150
Our client gets to keep 
a bullet in his chest,

24:47.150 --> 24:49.944
and he's probably gonna die.

24:50.070 --> 24:53.288
But a victory is a victory, right?

24:53.614 --> 24:56.329
You really think he's gonna die?

24:57.160 --> 25:00.001
The thing is in his chest.

25:04.442 --> 25:07.753
The doctor says if it isn't removed…

25:11.758 --> 25:14.804
Self-imposed death sentence
in order to avoid a prison sentence.

25:14.804 --> 25:16.441
The irony is palpable.

25:16.441 --> 25:20.164
I agree, and yet he is stuck.

25:20.830 --> 25:22.936
Or not.

25:24.271 --> 25:26.265
And this is?

25:26.355 --> 25:28.625
The discretionary option.

25:36.423 --> 25:38.850
My deputy gave me a full report.

25:38.850 --> 25:41.206
Needless to say, I'm outraged.

25:41.206 --> 25:43.467
That's refreshingly humane of you.

25:43.467 --> 25:45.124
I don't follow.

25:45.124 --> 25:48.605
–Perhaps I don't follow.
–I was quite explicit in my order.

25:48.605 --> 25:51.016
Four continuous hours 
in front of the building.

25:51.016 --> 25:53.384
Your guy barely lasted 20 minutes.

25:53.384 --> 25:55.830
At which point he was attacked
with a glass bottle,

25:55.830 --> 25:59.704
sending him to the emergency room
with a gaping wound in his head.

25:59.704 --> 26:01.098
Do you know 
what my mother would call you?

26:01.098 --> 26:04.435
A namby-pamby, weak and spineless,

26:04.435 --> 26:07.526
belly­aching about some
trumped­up medical excuse.

26:07.526 --> 26:10.674
Well, your guy's in violation
of his sentence.

26:10.674 --> 26:13.744
Your honor, is something 
not registering?

26:13.744 --> 26:16.331
Walter Mack was attacked.

26:16.331 --> 26:19.742
Next time, 
it could be considerably worse.

26:19.742 --> 26:22.377
If you're so worried,
take an extra marshal.

26:22.377 --> 26:26.966
But I want him back out there today
or the plea agreement is tossed.

26:26.966 --> 26:29.437
Is that understood?

26:29.437 --> 26:31.991
It is not, not at all.

26:34.129 --> 26:36.394
Goodbye, Mr Shore.

26:40.789 --> 26:42.807
I don't know what to do.

26:42.807 --> 26:45.727
I just feel so helpless.

26:46.235 --> 26:49.104
What about Alan Shore?

26:49.230 --> 26:51.492
What about him?

26:51.808 --> 26:54.048
He's been known to…

26:54.048 --> 26:57.655
accomplish things.
Maybe you should seek his help.

26:58.355 --> 27:00.431
You're not gonna find him.

27:01.119 --> 27:05.330
Oh, Alan Shore is taking judge Brown
before a disciplinary panel.

27:05.913 --> 27:07.040
When?

27:07.040 --> 27:08.834
Now.

27:08.834 --> 27:10.350
Excuse me.

27:15.631 --> 27:17.749
This is highly unusual, Mr Shore,

27:17.749 --> 27:22.489
seeking to discipline a judge for imposing 
a sentence your client agreed to.

27:22.489 --> 27:25.733
I suspect we'd all agree to a good beating
in order to avoid a prison sentence,

27:25.733 --> 27:27.107
but, your honors, 
we're not in Singapore.

27:27.107 --> 27:29.073
Still, given his consent…

27:29.073 --> 27:31.313
He didn't consent 
to land in a hospital bed

27:31.313 --> 27:33.942
with a concussion and 12 
stitches across his skull.

27:33.942 --> 27:37.201
And now, astonishingly, judge Brown 
expects him to go back for more.

27:37.201 --> 27:39.072
Pardon the interruption, your honors.

27:39.072 --> 27:41.069
Paul Lewiston of Crane, 
Poole & Schmidt.

27:41.069 --> 27:42.739
A word with my colleague.

27:42.739 --> 27:44.545
Stop this now.

27:44.545 --> 27:48.222
This doesn't concern you, Paul.
You should leave immediately.

27:48.921 --> 27:51.060
I am afraid Mr Shore has inadvertently

27:51.060 --> 27:54.014
overstepped his authority
in regard to this matter.

27:54.014 --> 27:58.696
Pursuant to a signed letter of retention,
Walter Mack is in fact a client of our firm,

27:58.696 --> 28:00.704
not Mr Shore specifically.
–That's ridiculous.

28:00.704 --> 28:03.149
I have personally represented
Walter Mack for years.

28:03.149 --> 28:08.648
Crane, Poole & Schmidt bears no ill will
toward judge Brown whatsoever,

28:08.648 --> 28:11.702
nor do we seek to second­guess
his sentencing of our client.

28:11.702 --> 28:13.444
And yet here I am, both 
second­guessing and bearing ill will.

28:13.444 --> 28:16.648
–Alan, you are out of line. —You interrupt 
my hearing and accuse me of being…

28:16.648 --> 28:18.610
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

28:18.820 --> 28:25.763
Next time I suggest you settle on a position
before convening an emergency panel.

28:26.969 --> 28:29.039
We are adjourned.

28:36.755 --> 28:41.260
In my courtroom,
with your client, tomorrow.

28:41.260 --> 28:43.221
Namby-pamby.

28:56.571 --> 28:59.878
It's not my habit to ambush colleagues
in the middle of a proceeding,

28:59.878 --> 29:02.408
but you gave me no choice, Alan.

29:02.408 --> 29:06.377
I cannot allow an associate to 
declare war on behalf of this firm,

29:06.377 --> 29:10.187
certainly not against a highly 
influential jurist.

29:10.870 --> 29:13.551
I'm giving notice.
I believe two weeks is standard.

29:13.551 --> 29:18.651
Now step aside, Paul, before I push you to 
the ground and go to the bathroom on you.

29:28.957 --> 29:30.250
Lori Colson?

29:30.250 --> 29:31.726
She's out of the office.

29:31.726 --> 29:33.154
I got to see her.

29:33.154 --> 29:35.371
You got to call her. Please.

29:35.371 --> 29:37.662
Michael, are you all right?

29:37.662 --> 29:39.301
You look awful.

29:40.063 --> 29:43.051
I'm thinking that maybe we 
could get some kind of plea.

29:43.051 --> 29:44.919
Is it too late?

29:44.919 --> 29:46.658
I don't know, but, Michael,
we've got to get you to a hospital.

29:46.658 --> 29:48.207
No, hey, no.

29:48.207 --> 29:51.212
I won't, okay?
I will die first.

29:52.512 --> 29:55.241
Michael. Oh, my God.
Michael, sit down.

29:56.041 --> 29:58.212
Sit down.

29:58.605 --> 30:00.343
Stay there. —Okay.

30:00.658 --> 30:01.967
Okay.

30:21.277 --> 30:23.572
I don't see a defendant, Mr Shore.

30:23.572 --> 30:26.409
I'm sure we can drum one up.
The building is teeming with them.

30:26.409 --> 30:28.339
I believe I made myself clear,

30:28.339 --> 30:31.670
but perhaps an order of contempt
will help move things forward.

30:31.670 --> 30:33.817
Your honor, if I could be
berated in just a moment,

30:33.817 --> 30:37.131
might we first take care 
of one brief ceremonial matter?

30:37.131 --> 30:39.147
Your mother has been 
waiting ever so patiently.

30:39.147 --> 30:41.097
Excuse me?

30:41.812 --> 30:44.682
Is this lovely woman 
not your mother?

30:45.689 --> 30:47.245
Mother.

30:47.303 --> 30:49.065
What are you doing in my courtroom?

30:49.065 --> 30:53.602
I was obviously thrilled to find her available 
to attend this long-overdue presentation,

30:53.602 --> 30:57.944
which I am honored to make
on behalf of the entire bar association,

30:57.944 --> 31:02.847
uh, subcommittee on judicial excellence
to the honorable Clark Brown,

31:02.847 --> 31:06.405
jurist, scholar, and humanitarian.

31:06.405 --> 31:07.910
–May I approach?
–You may not.

31:07.910 --> 31:08.993
I think I will.

31:08.993 --> 31:12.156
Many congratulations.

31:13.396 --> 31:16.053
I take it this is your 
horrific penmanship.

31:16.053 --> 31:19.375
It is, but in my defense,
I was driving to court at the time.

31:19.375 --> 31:23.046
And I suppose you think presenting me
with some cockamamie award you invented

31:23.046 --> 31:24.597
is going to help your case.

31:24.597 --> 31:26.262
The award is for your mother, judge.

31:26.262 --> 31:28.849
As for my case, as I see it,

31:28.849 --> 31:32.600
you can hold me in contempt,
you can send my client to prison,

31:32.600 --> 31:36.826
and you can dream up elaborate
and humiliating sentences ad infinitum,

31:36.826 --> 31:38.119
but unfortunately,

31:38.119 --> 31:43.466
nothing that you do will negate the 
ego-crushing, utterly emasculating effect

31:43.466 --> 31:46.982
your mother clearly has on you
as, I must confess, she had on me.

31:46.982 --> 31:51.740
After a mere 20 minutes, it was all I could 
do to resist dining and ditching the woman.

31:51.740 --> 31:55.530
Obviously, your issues with Esther,
Oedipal or otherwise,

31:55.530 --> 32:00.094
can't help but inform your appetite
for shame and humiliation,

32:00.094 --> 32:04.839
and it's entirely understandable,
but you're smarter than your mother.

32:04.839 --> 32:06.939
You're stronger than your mother.

32:06.939 --> 32:13.223
Show the old battle-ax one can be 
powerful and yet still be fair and just.

32:13.223 --> 32:15.692
My client Walter Mack 
has suffered enough.

32:15.692 --> 32:18.535
Let him fix his building
and move on with his life.

32:18.535 --> 32:20.065
Move on with yours.

32:20.065 --> 32:23.105
You're a judge.
You have all the power.

32:31.780 --> 32:33.912
Get away from my bench.

32:34.211 --> 32:35.451
Yes, sir.

32:45.221 --> 32:47.491
You have ignored 
a direct order of the court.

32:47.491 --> 32:51.760
I expect a handwritten letter of apology
delivered to my chambers by end of day.

32:51.760 --> 32:53.969
As for your client…

32:56.014 --> 33:00.683
he will complete the repairs
as listed on the plea agreement

33:00.683 --> 33:02.771
in one week's time.

33:02.771 --> 33:06.974
If he complies to the last detail,

33:06.974 --> 33:10.011
I shall spare him 
any further consequences.

33:10.011 --> 33:11.930
Thank you, sir.

33:12.256 --> 33:14.171
And you're dismissed.

33:14.348 --> 33:15.999
Next matter.

33:25.102 --> 33:26.712
It was my second coke bust,

33:26.712 --> 33:29.258
but somehow Alan got it kicked
to misdemeanor possession.

33:29.258 --> 33:31.098
No time served.

33:31.098 --> 33:33.343
Lost my license to practice.

33:33.343 --> 33:35.552
Could have been a lot worse, though.

33:37.122 --> 33:39.495
Everything's gonna be fine, Michael.
You passed out in my car.

33:39.495 --> 33:41.019
You're gonna be fine.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.827
I told you, no hospitals.

33:42.827 --> 33:45.517
Actually, we're not at hospital.

33:45.517 --> 33:47.878
Not exactly.
This is Dr Kodash.

33:47.878 --> 33:50.043
He's a friend of my colleague's.

33:50.043 --> 33:52.389
Michael, he's very discreet.

34:20.112 --> 34:23.083
Tell me about the Raving Loon.

34:23.161 --> 34:25.982
State bird of Minnesota, actually.

34:28.168 --> 34:31.317
I heard about your run-in 
with Paul Lewiston.

34:34.958 --> 34:37.739
Did you really threaten to pee on him?

34:39.802 --> 34:41.246
Forgive me, Denny.

34:41.246 --> 34:44.679
I'm not in my usual good humor.

34:47.728 --> 34:50.891
He never wanted 
you here from day one.

34:51.018 --> 34:52.880
That in mind,

34:53.317 --> 34:57.948
you can leave and give him
the victory he's aiming for.

34:58.766 --> 35:00.354
Or…

35:01.015 --> 35:03.111
you can stay,

35:03.111 --> 35:08.232
your very presence torturing him

35:08.371 --> 35:12.382
hour after hour, day after day.

35:12.804 --> 35:15.620
That's what I do.

35:22.063 --> 35:26.247
For the record, I hate sentiment.

35:26.340 --> 35:31.293
But before you got here, I was 
beginning to loathe this place.

35:53.361 --> 35:54.638
Hey.

35:55.383 --> 35:58.198
I couldn't find you last night.
Everything all right?

35:58.198 --> 35:59.156
Fine.

35:59.156 --> 36:01.188
I left the hospital and was 
too depressed to work,

36:01.188 --> 36:03.868
so I went home and took
an extraordinarily long bath.

36:03.868 --> 36:06.144
Well, you missed some excitement.

36:06.144 --> 36:07.619
Oh?

36:23.763 --> 36:27.016
You're not interested 
as to how I came upon this?

36:29.570 --> 36:31.729
I have a pretty good idea.

36:41.881 --> 36:44.241
Oh, dear. 
Am I in trouble?

36:44.585 --> 36:46.417
Let me guess.

36:46.417 --> 36:48.288
You send my client to a mob doctor

36:48.288 --> 36:52.188
working in the back room of some 
underworld casino you frequent.

36:53.556 --> 36:56.476
I'm sorry to say the reality
is far less colorful,

36:56.476 --> 36:58.131
but I applaud your imagination.

36:58.131 --> 37:00.884
You're amazingly inconsiderate,
you know that?

37:00.884 --> 37:02.856
I do.

37:02.856 --> 37:06.314
How does it show? —I have known 
Michael Shea for five years, Alan,

37:06.314 --> 37:09.562
and ridiculousas it sounds,
he's somebody I happen to care about.

37:09.562 --> 37:12.451
–You don't even know him.
–We could all have lunch if you'd like.

37:12.451 --> 37:14.961
You sent him off to 
commit yet another crime.

37:14.961 --> 37:16.543
There's no crime, Lori, just a bullet.

37:16.543 --> 37:17.817
Turn it in if you want.

37:17.817 --> 37:19.527
Of course I'm not gonna do that,

37:19.527 --> 37:20.861
but I shouldn't even 
be in this position,

37:20.861 --> 37:22.488
and Tara shouldn't, either.

37:22.488 --> 37:24.103
Why would you corrupt her like that?

37:24.103 --> 37:27.099
Tara's a grownup, capable of making 
all sorts of grown-up decisions.

37:27.099 --> 37:29.171
Don't be glib with me.

37:29.171 --> 37:30.450
Tara adores you.

37:30.450 --> 37:33.258
Of course she's gonna follow 
your lead until one day she slips up,

37:33.258 --> 37:35.301
somehow blows it,
and her career is over.

37:35.301 --> 37:38.506
And yet here I sit,
years of evil­doing under my belt,

37:38.506 --> 37:40.384
and still a happy camper.

37:40.384 --> 37:42.468
I suppose you're the exception,

37:42.468 --> 37:44.273
but to what end?

37:44.273 --> 37:46.262
I mean, you conspire 
to conceal evidence,

37:46.262 --> 37:48.515
you take on a judge
to help out a slumlord.

37:48.515 --> 37:52.443
You know, sometimes 
you're in the right, Alan,

37:52.443 --> 37:56.223
but other times, it seems like
you just can't control yourself.

37:58.743 --> 38:00.661
I think you're lost.

38:28.097 --> 38:30.265
Am I lost, Denny?

38:30.265 --> 38:32.234
Depends what you're looking for.

38:36.020 --> 38:38.680
Lori Colson thinks I'm lost.

38:38.680 --> 38:40.417
Screw her.

38:41.485 --> 38:43.205
Have you?

38:43.205 --> 38:45.781
That's impolite talk, Denny.

38:48.146 --> 38:49.963
Everything okay?

38:52.704 --> 38:54.794
I'm the one that's lost, Alan.

38:54.794 --> 38:57.958
–How so?
–Empty, I should say.

38:57.958 --> 39:01.060
All my life, I wanted the Red Sox
to win the world series.

39:01.060 --> 39:03.395
It was like a quest, you know?

39:03.395 --> 39:08.005
Something burning inside.

39:08.369 --> 39:11.354
And now the bastards have done it,

39:11.354 --> 39:12.933
and I feel like…

39:12.933 --> 39:15.893
I don't know, 
like my pilot light went out.

39:15.936 --> 39:18.087
I know what you mean.

39:18.663 --> 39:21.971
We've been comfortable 
aspiring to championship.

39:21.971 --> 39:25.540
I don't know how comfortable
we are as champions.

39:26.407 --> 39:28.851
–What do we do now?
–I don't know.

39:29.089 --> 39:31.930
Must be awful rooting for the Yankees.

39:35.710 --> 39:38.445
Listen, Denny, 
would you do me a favor?

39:38.445 --> 39:39.514
Name it.

39:39.514 --> 39:42.171
Friend of mine, 
she's wanted to meet you.

39:42.171 --> 39:44.411
She's here now.

39:44.881 --> 39:47.521
–You sure you don't mind?
–No, bring her in.

39:50.636 --> 39:52.135
Sarah.

39:59.271 --> 40:01.242
Hello, Denny.

40:05.550 --> 40:07.297
Solid ash.

40:07.297 --> 40:10.639
Same wood they use 
to make Manny's bat.

40:14.328 --> 40:16.797
You're a corrupting influence.

40:16.797 --> 40:18.477
Yes.

40:18.897 --> 40:20.792
So I've been told.

40:23.754 --> 40:25.927
Sarah.

40:25.927 --> 40:27.715
Join us for a drink.

40:27.715 --> 40:29.550
I'd love to.

40:29.550 --> 40:32.567
A toast to us, to love,

40:32.567 --> 40:35.538
–but most of all…
–The Boston Red Sox.

40:36.978 --> 40:38.650
The Red Sox.

40:50.655 --> 40:52.804
Is it really made of ash?

40:53.591 --> 40:55.784
I think so.

40:57.620 --> 40:59.690
Give you any trouble dancing?

40:59.690 --> 41:01.965
Not a bit.

41:05.072 --> 41:08.756
Maybe we could go dancing later.

41:08.756 --> 41:11.219
I'd love that.

41:16.577 --> 41:19.002
.

41:19.002 --> 41:21.036
.

41:21.036 --> 41:24.875
.
