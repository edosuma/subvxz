WEBVTT

00:03.570 --> 00:06.138
So when they asked me
to train the new hire, Diane,

00:06.140 --> 00:08.507
I was like, "Get me
a beef sandwich, Diane!"

00:08.509 --> 00:11.110
Then Diane send Dick
to get the sandwich.

00:11.112 --> 00:13.779
Diane totally gets how
things work at the CIA.

00:13.781 --> 00:15.447
Sorry, Francine,
what did you ask me?

00:15.449 --> 00:17.282
<i>I</i> asked you to let go
of my wrist.

00:17.284 --> 00:21.520
You tried to take a waffle,
and I'm first waffle guy.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.122
Stan, can I catch
a ride?

00:23.124 --> 00:25.824
Got my first shift for
Southwest Airlines today.

00:25.826 --> 00:28.227
What? You don't know anything
about being a flight attendant.

00:28.229 --> 00:29.962
But I do know comedy.

00:29.964 --> 00:32.131
And that's all
that matters at Southwest.

00:32.133 --> 00:33.665
With you there,
people should check

00:33.667 --> 00:35.134
their sensitivities
at the gate.

00:35.136 --> 00:37.736
Oh, my God, that's like
a perfect Southwest joke!

00:37.738 --> 00:39.304
I want that joke!

00:39.306 --> 00:40.572
Give me that joke!

00:40.574 --> 00:42.808
Ugh! You're getting syrup
in my hair!

00:42.810 --> 00:43.909
Somebody help her!

00:43.911 --> 00:45.978
You can use it!
Jesus!

00:45.980 --> 00:47.346
Yay!

00:47.348 --> 00:49.214
And as a thank you,
I'll tell you how to get

00:49.216 --> 00:52.317
your seat upgraded without
paying a dime extra.

Whoa!

01:09.904 --> 01:12.237
I was paralyzed for,
like, 10 seconds.

01:12.239 --> 01:14.773
I couldn't move.
Did anyone else see that?

01:14.775 --> 01:16.608
I thought I had a stroke.

so I'm gonna be late
for dinner.

01:52.947 --> 01:54.880
Unless I eat with Diane.

01:54.882 --> 01:56.815
Then we'll just eat
when we're hungry.

01:56.817 --> 01:59.284
Stan is spending a lot of time
with this Diane person,

01:59.286 --> 02:00.719
don't you think?

02:00.721 --> 02:03.122
Klaus, when you're married
to a sexy man,

02:03.124 --> 02:05.591
there's always gonna be some
bush league snizz

02:05.593 --> 02:07.159
trying to storm the castle.

02:07.161 --> 02:08.426
Aren't you worried?

02:08.429 --> 02:09.794
Yeah, I'm worried.

02:09.797 --> 02:12.664
I'm worried about Diane's
hospital bills.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.833
Oh, shit!
Girl don't play!

02:14.835 --> 02:16.401
What's the plan?!

02:16.403 --> 02:19.104
I think that's a question
for my girlfriends.

02:19.106 --> 02:21.306
Oh, getting the war counsel
together.

02:21.308 --> 02:23.742
Merlot for my girls...

02:23.744 --> 02:25.277
and for me,

a little bit of Francine's
private reserve.

Ooh! Hoo! Wha!

02:33.521 --> 02:36.288
Francine!

02:36.290 --> 02:37.523
Sharon!

02:37.525 --> 02:39.091
What up, Franny?!

02:39.093 --> 02:40.459
Caroline!

02:40.461 --> 02:42.194
-Where's Connie?
-Hey, y'all.

02:42.196 --> 02:45.531
Television star Connie Britton,
you made it!

02:45.533 --> 02:47.366

Friends, friends, friends!

02:47.368 --> 02:50.702
(mumbling incoherently)

02:50.704 --> 02:53.005
He said he's taking her
to the range,

02:53.007 --> 02:56.141
but he left his white leather
shooting glove at home.

02:56.143 --> 02:58.944
So let's call him up,
catch him in his lie.

02:58.946 --> 03:00.879
Good idea.

03:00.881 --> 03:02.514

<i>STAN: Hello?</i>

03:02.516 --> 03:06.318
Honey, how are you going to

03:06.320 --> 03:08.320
when you left your
shooting glove at home?

03:08.322 --> 03:10.022
<i>Excuse me?</i>
<i>I-I don't understand.</i>

03:10.024 --> 03:11.223

03:16.797 --> 03:18.697
Maybe go for a nice long drive.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.332
He's playing dumb.

03:20.334 --> 03:21.733
Good-bye, Stan.

03:21.735 --> 03:24.136
This Diane's
a serious threat.

03:24.138 --> 03:26.205
Hey,<i> I'm</i> the serious
threat.

03:26.207 --> 03:27.906
Go take care of business.

03:27.908 --> 03:30.576
Punch her
in them floppy tits!

03:30.578 --> 03:33.078
(mumbling)

03:33.080 --> 03:35.047
Ooh.

03:35.049 --> 03:37.349
It looks like
the bank's open.

03:37.351 --> 03:39.551
And the beauty parlor.

03:46.694 --> 03:49.861
<i>Time to put away laptops,</i>

04:11.352 --> 04:13.018
See that?

04:13.020 --> 04:15.220
God, what a high.
You're cute.

04:15.222 --> 04:18.857
How about after we go wheels up,
I come in there and go heels up,

04:18.858 --> 04:22.394
and you can unload your
passengers at Gate "A."

04:22.396 --> 04:25.264
<i>Donna forget to mention,</i>

<i>Don't worry about correcting me</i>

04:59.466 --> 05:01.166
(laughs) Damn it!

05:03.637 --> 05:05.671
Looks like another
late one with Diane.

05:05.673 --> 05:07.572
<i>FRANCINE: Stay as late</i>

05:13.080 --> 05:14.413
Yeah, I love that place!

05:14.415 --> 05:16.782
Maybe I'll watch
that show "House,"

05:16.784 --> 05:19.618
or "House...of Lies."

05:19.620 --> 05:21.586
Oh, no, no, no! Don't talk
about "House of Lies."

05:21.588 --> 05:23.322
I'm only halfway
through season one!

05:23.324 --> 05:25.524
La la la la la!

05:25.526 --> 05:27.526
(ding)

05:30.030 --> 05:32.831
STAN: Oh, yeah.
Come on! Yeah.

05:32.833 --> 05:35.100
That pig!

05:35.102 --> 05:37.302
Oh, God, I'm gonna finish
in record time!

05:37.304 --> 05:39.671
He never finishes fast
with me.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.139
Can I help you?

05:41.141 --> 05:43.375
I don't think so.
I'm here to deal with Diane.

05:43.377 --> 05:45.544
That's me.
No, you're not.

05:45.546 --> 05:48.280
Diane's in there,
finishing off my husband.

05:48.282 --> 05:50.515
I'm obviously not
in there with Stan.

05:50.517 --> 05:53.151
You're as bad
a liar as he is.

05:53.153 --> 05:56.521
Now, excuse me
while I bust you guys!

05:56.523 --> 05:58.523
Stan?

05:58.525 --> 06:00.859
Francine?!
I-It's not what it looks like.

06:00.861 --> 06:05.530
It looks like you're playing
with little toy cars.

06:05.532 --> 06:08.567
On the contrary.
This is a slot car --

06:08.569 --> 06:12.137
a 1/32 scale McLaren M7
with magnetic suspension,

06:12.139 --> 06:14.473
2.4 volt engine,
and a real European --

06:14.475 --> 06:15.974
Oh, wait.
This is a toy car.

06:15.976 --> 06:18.510
This is all the stuff
I said before.

06:18.512 --> 06:21.480
And when I put it on the track,
it goes fast.

06:21.482 --> 06:23.181
Oh!

06:23.183 --> 06:25.150
Ooh!

06:25.152 --> 06:26.852
Oh!

06:26.854 --> 06:28.854
Oh!

06:28.856 --> 06:30.589
So...

06:30.591 --> 06:32.724
you're not
hooking up with her.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.526
I wish!

06:34.528 --> 06:35.894
Yeah!

06:35.896 --> 06:38.063
And you're not interested
in him.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.866
(laughs)
Little tiny car guy?

06:40.868 --> 06:43.034
No.
He's all yours.

06:43.036 --> 06:45.370
Oh.
Great.

06:45.372 --> 06:47.372
My car has been slippy
on this turn.

06:47.374 --> 06:49.574
(fabric tears)
Francine, my pants ripped.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.676
Go to my desk, in my top drawer,
there's a pair

06:51.678 --> 06:53.945
of sky-blue
wrinkle-release Dockers.

06:53.947 --> 06:55.547
Underneath that is my
"Phantom of the Opera"

06:55.549 --> 06:57.282
long sleeve t-shirt.

06:57.284 --> 07:01.186
Please bring it immediately
and tie it around my waist.

07:05.793 --> 07:07.893
Wow, you must be
so relieved.

07:07.895 --> 07:10.762
To go from thinking your husband
was cheating on you

07:10.764 --> 07:12.764
to realizing
he's an amazing athlete.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.634
But -- But why didn't you
tell me about this?

07:15.636 --> 07:17.869
Because I knew you'd try
to talk me out of racing

07:17.871 --> 07:20.372
Lonny Bulmanferg at
the Altoona Grand Prix.

07:20.374 --> 07:22.140
Lonny Bulmanferg?

07:22.142 --> 07:24.376
Let's push him out of our minds
for one night.

07:24.378 --> 07:26.611
Maybe with a sex.
(groans)

07:26.613 --> 07:28.380
Ah, pins and needles,
pins and needles!

07:28.382 --> 07:29.915
Ah.

07:29.917 --> 07:32.050
My legs are useless.

07:32.052 --> 07:35.086
Could be a great opportunity
for you to ride me.

07:35.088 --> 07:37.722
But first, go to my study,
in the right desk drawer,

07:37.724 --> 07:39.791
underneath a pair of
pleated burgundy Dockers,

07:39.793 --> 07:41.893
you'll find my
lovemaking sandals.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.128
What is that?

07:43.130 --> 07:44.796
Freakin' Bulmanferg.

07:44.798 --> 07:48.099
Prepare yourself for
a rage boner, Francine.

07:48.101 --> 07:49.434
I...

07:49.436 --> 07:51.269
got to go
to the bathroom.

07:51.271 --> 07:53.672
Make sure you use
the wet wipes just in case

07:53.674 --> 07:55.874
I want to go mousing
around down there.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.644
Here I come, ladies.

07:59.646 --> 08:02.080
(gulping)

08:02.082 --> 08:04.316
(grunts)

08:04.318 --> 08:05.684
Girl, what are
we doing here?

08:05.686 --> 08:07.252
You don't have
to worry about Diane.

08:07.254 --> 08:08.987
She thinks Stan's
a real zero.

08:08.989 --> 08:11.790
Problem solved!
Or is that the problem?

08:11.792 --> 08:14.826
One of the things that
thrilled me about Stan

08:14.828 --> 08:17.429
was other women
finding him sexy.

08:17.431 --> 08:19.431
Like having my own
Chris Hemsworth.

08:19.433 --> 08:23.301
If you want that thrill back,
you could sexy up Stan.

08:23.303 --> 08:25.003
Take him
to get a makeover!

08:25.005 --> 08:26.605
To the mall!

08:26.607 --> 08:29.374
(slurred)
To the mall!

08:31.879 --> 08:34.513
All right. Roger said we can
all fly for free somewhere,

08:34.515 --> 08:36.347
so we need to agree
on a place to go.

08:36.350 --> 08:38.183
I vote for
Na Pali State Park.

08:38.184 --> 08:39.650
Wait, that's what
I was gonna say.

08:39.653 --> 08:41.953
So was I!
This is crazy!

08:41.955 --> 08:43.388
Hawaii...

08:43.390 --> 08:45.891
TOGETHER: Here we com--

08:45.893 --> 08:47.392
Pack your bags,
we're going to Fort Worth.

08:47.394 --> 08:48.460
-What?!
-Fort Worth?!

08:48.462 --> 08:49.728
Okay!

08:49.730 --> 08:51.563
You said we could go
anywhere we want.

08:51.565 --> 08:52.964
And now I'm saying

08:52.966 --> 08:54.633
that you're coming with me
to laugh at my jokes

08:54.635 --> 08:57.736
because Karen is trying to drop
a wet deuce on my dreams!

08:57.738 --> 09:00.672
If I wanted to hear jokes,
I'd go to Snot's stand-up show.

09:00.674 --> 09:02.874
He's got a --
He's got a new bit about...

09:02.876 --> 09:05.977
(chuckles)
how -- how bands at weddings,

09:05.979 --> 09:07.712
since they -- they just do
cover songs

09:07.714 --> 09:10.649
are basically juke boxes
that only take hundreds.

09:10.651 --> 09:13.151
(chuckles) He can make jokes
out of anything.

09:13.153 --> 09:15.487
Guys, guys,
you know me.

09:15.489 --> 09:17.389
Do I respond rationally

09:17.391 --> 09:21.426
when a new thang I'm into
is met with resistance?

09:21.428 --> 09:23.194
(choking)
So how about it?

09:23.196 --> 09:25.163
Are we all going to
Fort Worth via Buffalo?

09:25.165 --> 09:26.398
Let him go!

09:26.400 --> 09:28.166
Okay, okay,
I'm checking in now!

09:28.168 --> 09:30.936
You, show me your laugh.
(forced laughing)

09:30.938 --> 09:32.671
That's great!
You're doing it!

09:32.673 --> 09:34.773
(gasping)
You guys are gonna love it.

09:34.775 --> 09:37.175
I start with stand-up,
and then I move into improv,

09:37.177 --> 09:39.110
which I've been really
flowing on lately.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.946
Check it, give me
one word to start.

09:40.948 --> 09:43.181
Um...
Cactus.

09:43.183 --> 09:45.884
Perfect, cactus.

09:45.886 --> 09:48.353
I'm choking this cactus!

09:50.891 --> 09:52.457
Francine,
why are we here?

09:52.459 --> 09:54.025
I need to work
on my slot cars.

09:54.027 --> 09:56.294
I just thought you could
do it in cooler shoes,

09:56.296 --> 09:58.563
a V-neck sweater,
and jeans so tight

09:58.565 --> 10:01.733
you have to put your dick
and balls down different legs.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.301
Let's just hurry this up.

10:03.303 --> 10:05.270
Mel's counting on me to be ready
for this weekend's race.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.805
Mel?

10:06.807 --> 10:09.207
Mel's my lane monkey,
grooms the track, greases turns.

10:09.209 --> 10:10.875
Can't grease
too much, though.

10:10.877 --> 10:12.143
The cars can shoot
off the track.

10:12.145 --> 10:13.778
One car hit a guy
in the arm once.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.914
They stopped the race
so his mom could blow on it

10:15.916 --> 10:17.382
and give him
some Gatorade.

10:18.885 --> 10:21.486
Excuse me,
see that guy over there?

10:21.488 --> 10:24.656
I need you to make him
irresistible to women.

10:24.658 --> 10:25.957
Super jump.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.892
So what do you think
he'd look good in?

10:27.894 --> 10:29.227
A coffin.

10:29.229 --> 10:31.162
Oh, damn!

10:31.164 --> 10:33.331
Do you have
this in green?

10:33.333 --> 10:35.467
(slurping)
I don't understand

10:35.469 --> 10:38.903
why you have to wear that
fanny pack over your new suit.

10:38.905 --> 10:40.105
You want me
to carry hundreds

10:40.107 --> 10:42.107
of tiny screwdrivers
in my pockets?

10:42.109 --> 10:43.608
Are you crazy?
(fabric rips)

10:43.610 --> 10:45.143
Oh, my pants
just ripped again.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.479
How?!
You're just sitting there.

10:47.481 --> 10:48.980
I got a weird ass.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.419
We've wasted the whole day
at the mall.

10:54.421 --> 10:56.287
Now I've got to rush
to the airport.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.456
Well, if you got to wear
the fanny pack,

10:58.458 --> 11:00.325
why don't you pop
on these aviators

11:00.327 --> 11:03.094
or maybe go sleeveless.

11:03.096 --> 11:05.330
My sleeves!
You know how cold I get!

11:05.332 --> 11:06.631
(shivering)

11:06.633 --> 11:08.433
Suck it up, Stan!

11:08.435 --> 11:11.002
You're turning women off
all over town!

11:11.004 --> 11:12.837
You said I look like
Chris Hemsworth!

11:12.839 --> 11:14.139
I lied!

11:14.141 --> 11:16.374
You look Elliot Hemsworth!

11:16.376 --> 11:17.709
Elliot?

11:17.711 --> 11:19.377
He's the disgrace
of the Hemsworth clan.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.546
They tried to remove all trace
of him on the Internet.

11:21.548 --> 11:23.114
With good reason!

11:23.116 --> 11:24.482
He's not an actor.

11:24.484 --> 11:26.384
He's just a doctor.

11:26.386 --> 11:28.987
(gasps)
Well, you're a doctor, too!

11:28.989 --> 11:30.522
Dr. Evil!

11:30.524 --> 11:33.224
"One million dollars!"

11:33.226 --> 11:36.061
That's you!
(sobbing)

11:38.565 --> 11:41.533
Can't you be the guy
who other women want again?

11:41.535 --> 11:43.635
We can fix this!
We?

11:43.637 --> 11:45.003
Hey, I don't have
to fix anything.

11:45.005 --> 11:46.571
This is <i> your</i> problem.

11:46.573 --> 11:48.573
I'm just trying to live my life
and race my car.

11:48.575 --> 11:51.376
Not worry about whether women
find me attractive.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.478
Well, they don't!

11:53.480 --> 11:55.714
WOMAN: Hey, Stan!
Mel!

11:55.716 --> 11:57.215
(squeals)

11:57.217 --> 11:59.017
I am so excited
for Altoona!

11:59.019 --> 12:00.251
Tell me about it.

12:00.253 --> 12:01.720
I'm ready to run through
a brick wall.

12:01.722 --> 12:04.222
Oh, Mel, this is my
cruel wife, Francine.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.191
So nice
to finally meet you.

12:06.193 --> 12:07.892
What the...

12:12.199 --> 12:13.565
We should go, Stan.

12:13.567 --> 12:14.833
Yep.
Right behind ya.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.735
Just how I like it.

12:16.737 --> 12:18.503
(giggles)
Kidding!

12:18.505 --> 12:19.904
<i>That's</i> Mel?

12:19.906 --> 12:21.372
Yep, she's my lane monkey

12:21.374 --> 12:24.008
and does some
T3 raid racing herself.

12:24.010 --> 12:25.243
Sorry, slot talk.

12:25.245 --> 12:28.346
Probably not
doin' it for ya.

12:28.348 --> 12:30.215
Why wouldn't he
tell me about her?

12:30.217 --> 12:31.549
STEVE: Mom?

12:31.551 --> 12:33.284
Don't look at her,
don't talk to her.

12:33.286 --> 12:36.087
Her thing doesn't concern us.
We're not talking to her.

12:39.025 --> 12:42.026
(tires squeal)

12:42.028 --> 12:44.062
Oh, Stan!

12:44.064 --> 12:47.232
You can drive me anywhere.

12:47.234 --> 12:50.702
(engine revs)

12:50.704 --> 12:53.371
I want to go there.

12:53.373 --> 12:54.839
<i>♪ Ooh, wee ♪</i>

12:57.310 --> 12:58.643
<i>♪ Ooh ♪</i>

13:01.148 --> 13:03.648
(giggles)
Stan!

13:06.887 --> 13:09.654
Stop!
Stan, stop right now!

13:09.656 --> 13:11.156
But you're the one driving.

13:11.158 --> 13:14.125
♪♪

13:14.127 --> 13:17.262
<i>♪ Ooh, wee ♪</i>

13:17.264 --> 13:19.130
<i>♪ Ooh, wee ♪</i>

13:19.132 --> 13:21.332
(giggles) Faster.

13:21.334 --> 13:23.334
Faster!

13:23.336 --> 13:26.437
No, no.
Oh, no, no!

13:26.439 --> 13:28.339
Oh, my God!

13:28.341 --> 13:29.974
I drove him toward --

13:29.976 --> 13:31.910
(screams)
Hey, Francine.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.578
Wake up,
wake up, wake up!

13:33.580 --> 13:34.946
It's okay, you're awake!

13:34.948 --> 13:37.148
I've been experimenting
with steroids.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.150
It's awesome!

13:39.152 --> 13:40.652
Now I wear tank tops

13:40.654 --> 13:43.521
with the thinnest straps
you've ever seen.

13:45.000 --> 13:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:52.632 --> 13:55.600
You okay?
You've been so quiet.

13:55.602 --> 13:57.368
I had a big fight
with Francine.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.871
She said some things
that have me wondering if --

13:59.873 --> 14:02.507
(imitates tires screeching)
Aw!

14:02.509 --> 14:06.477
Did wittle Stan Smith have
a fight with his wittle wife?

14:06.479 --> 14:08.213
You don't even have
a wife, Lonny.

14:08.215 --> 14:09.814
That's 'cause
I don't want one!

14:09.816 --> 14:11.616
I could have any girl
in this place!

14:11.618 --> 14:14.118
I'm the only girl here.

14:14.120 --> 14:16.621
Are -- Are you asking me
to marry you?

14:16.623 --> 14:18.356
Just worry about the race

14:18.358 --> 14:20.558
and the killer joke
about your name

14:20.560 --> 14:23.661
that Stan's got locked
and loaded for after he wins.

14:23.663 --> 14:24.963
Good luck.

14:24.965 --> 14:26.464
People have been trying
to make fun of

14:26.466 --> 14:29.334
the Bulmanferg name for years,
but it's bulletproof!

14:29.336 --> 14:31.703
And you're not gonna
have a chance anyway.

14:31.705 --> 14:35.740
'Cause you're a loser --
a real Elliot Hemsworth!

14:35.742 --> 14:38.409
Turbo boost!
(zooming)

14:38.411 --> 14:40.144
Elliot might be a doctor now,

14:40.146 --> 14:42.080
but here's still time
to turn his life around.

14:42.082 --> 14:43.514
(sighs)

14:43.516 --> 14:45.917
Julia Child didn't blossom
till her mid-40s.

14:45.919 --> 14:48.586
Yeah, and Judi Dench --
this is a fact, I read it --

14:48.588 --> 14:52.056
simply did not exist until
she was 56 years old.

14:54.594 --> 14:57.362
I've driven Stan into
the arms of some skank

14:57.364 --> 15:00.231
who actually cares about
all his stupid stuff!

15:00.233 --> 15:02.333
Oh, there's an easy way
to fix this.

15:02.335 --> 15:04.502
Just sleep with
one of his coworkers.

15:04.504 --> 15:05.837
That works.

15:05.839 --> 15:08.072
Or the super-ripped fish.
He's hot.

15:08.074 --> 15:10.909
Or someone closer to him,

15:10.911 --> 15:13.378
like his little buddy,
Steve.

15:13.380 --> 15:16.381
No, I'm not sleeping
with Steve!

15:16.383 --> 15:17.882
What am I doing?

15:17.884 --> 15:19.784
Drinking Windex
and fertilizer

15:19.786 --> 15:22.086
and talking to the voices
in my head?!

15:22.088 --> 15:24.022
This ends now!

15:24.024 --> 15:27.058
-No!
-No!

15:27.060 --> 15:29.360
We'll be waiting
for you in Hell!

15:29.362 --> 15:32.096
You will weep before
the Dark Lord!

15:32.098 --> 15:34.098
Your arms are too thick
for that dress!

15:34.100 --> 15:35.867
Everyone thinks so!

15:35.869 --> 15:38.303
I'm gonna go get
my husband back!

15:38.305 --> 15:39.971
Klaus, you're in charge.

15:39.973 --> 15:41.973
I'm taking control
of my life.

15:41.975 --> 15:44.342
You see the pool, right?

15:48.748 --> 15:50.415
Then there's
James Michener.

15:50.417 --> 15:52.550
He didn't write his first book
until he was 40.

15:52.552 --> 15:55.253
Helen Mirren wasn't hot
until she turned 70.

15:55.255 --> 15:58.156
Yeah. Stan, you have a long list
of late-bloomers.

15:58.158 --> 15:59.724
(sighs)

15:59.726 --> 16:01.626
Can I ask you a question?

16:01.628 --> 16:04.095
Do you think I'm...
attractive?

16:04.097 --> 16:07.799
Stan, you're the first white man
I've ever been attracted to.

16:07.801 --> 16:09.067
I appreciate that.

16:09.069 --> 16:10.835
(cellphone rings)

16:10.837 --> 16:12.971
It's Francine.
I should take this.

16:12.973 --> 16:14.439
Don't think
about Francine.

16:14.441 --> 16:16.074
You've got the biggest race
of your life tomorrow.

16:16.076 --> 16:18.776
You need to relax.
Hey.

16:18.778 --> 16:20.979
I've got a naughty idea.

16:20.981 --> 16:23.147
(whispering)

16:26.119 --> 16:28.786
<i>And them first class</i>
<i>be like spoiled little kids.</i>

16:28.788 --> 16:30.955
<i>Spoiled little kids</i>
<i>sitting there all,</i>

16:30.957 --> 16:33.191
<i>"Where's my apple juice?"</i>

16:33.193 --> 16:35.593
(forced laughter)

16:35.595 --> 16:37.829
Exit row gets it.

16:37.831 --> 16:41.032
<i>Meanwhile, coach passengers</i>
<i>be like, "Can I have a seat?</i>

16:41.034 --> 16:43.434
<i>Can I have a seat?</i>

16:43.436 --> 16:44.936
<i>Just one little seat.</i>

16:44.938 --> 16:47.005
<i>Just one big enough</i>
<i>to put my butt cheek on</i>

16:47.007 --> 16:49.140
<i>while first class drinks</i>
<i>their apple juice."</i>

16:49.142 --> 16:51.209
(forced laughter)

16:51.211 --> 16:55.046
<i>I hope that's the</i> only <i> crash</i>
<i>landing we experience today.</i>

16:55.048 --> 16:57.482
(laughter and applause)

16:57.484 --> 17:00.151
<i>We'll be touching down</i>
<i>in Fort Worth soon.</i>

17:00.153 --> 17:03.054
<i>A funny name, because any</i>
<i>reason "worth" visiting</i>

17:03.056 --> 17:05.990
<i>must be hidden</i>
<i>in a "fort" somewhere.</i>

17:05.992 --> 17:08.192
(laughter and applause)

17:09.863 --> 17:12.864
(slot cars zooming)

17:26.980 --> 17:29.881
MAN: Four laps to go,
they're neck and neck!

17:32.252 --> 17:34.819
This is crazy!

17:34.821 --> 17:36.788
Here they come!

17:38.491 --> 17:40.158
The yellow car won.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.927
Wait, i-it's over?
Did I win?

17:42.929 --> 17:44.429
Did you have
the yellow car?

17:44.431 --> 17:45.730
-Yeah.
-Then you won.

17:45.732 --> 17:46.998
Yes!

17:47.000 --> 17:49.400
All right, Stan.
You bested me.

17:49.402 --> 17:53.037
But the Bulmanferg name
remains indestructible.

17:53.039 --> 17:54.939
I wouldn't be so sure...

17:54.941 --> 17:57.275
Foolmanferg.

17:57.277 --> 17:58.943
You have...

17:58.945 --> 18:00.578
destroyed me.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.346
Look for me
in the obituaries.

18:02.348 --> 18:04.682
Yes!
You did it, Stan!

18:04.684 --> 18:07.718
Mel, I can't stop thinking
about what we did last night.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.220
I feel terrible.

18:09.222 --> 18:11.923
It was a one-time thing,
no one has to know.

18:11.925 --> 18:15.226
I'll know.

18:15.228 --> 18:17.929
Forget about him.
You need a real man.

18:17.931 --> 18:20.131
What do you say
we go up to my room

18:20.133 --> 18:22.533
and you take
my virginity.

18:28.274 --> 18:29.974
(sighs)

18:32.145 --> 18:33.411
Francine?!

18:33.413 --> 18:35.480
Stan, I'm so sorry.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.548
(sobbing)

18:37.550 --> 18:40.651
Francine,
I cheated with Mel!

18:40.653 --> 18:43.154
Oh, God!
I knew it!

18:43.156 --> 18:44.956
I threw it all away.

18:44.958 --> 18:47.758
I had it all,
and I threw it all away.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.428
(sobbing)

18:50.430 --> 18:52.463
No, it was my fault!

18:52.465 --> 18:54.398
I pushed you away.

18:54.400 --> 18:55.933
We can come back from this.

18:55.935 --> 18:57.468
We can rebuild!

18:57.470 --> 19:00.805
No, it's over, Francine.
We have to get a divorce.

19:00.807 --> 19:03.174
I won't fight you for custody.
You can have them.

19:03.176 --> 19:05.843
I can't believe
this is happening!

19:05.845 --> 19:07.845
Mel said it wouldn't
be such a big deal

19:07.847 --> 19:09.480
if we stripped
everything off.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.916
Ah! Stripped it off!

19:11.918 --> 19:13.484
And shaved down the axle.

19:13.486 --> 19:16.921
You shaved down the axle!

19:16.923 --> 19:18.756
And we added tack
to the tires

19:18.758 --> 19:21.159
so we wouldn't lose speed
on the turns!

19:21.161 --> 19:23.161
Tack to the tires?!

19:23.163 --> 19:25.663
I should have let you
do that to me!

19:25.665 --> 19:29.133
Wait. Are you talking about
cheating at slot cars?

19:29.135 --> 19:31.135
Yes, my title
means nothing.

19:31.137 --> 19:32.470
I'm a fraud!

19:32.472 --> 19:34.772
Oh, good.
Our marriage is fine.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.474
Stan, I was wrong
for trying to change you.

19:36.476 --> 19:37.775
I'll see you at home.

19:37.777 --> 19:40.545
(groaning)

19:40.547 --> 19:44.382
(sobbing) How did this become
so important to me?!

19:46.886 --> 19:50.721
<i>Remember, our menu is 100%</i>
<i>gluten-free...</i>

19:50.723 --> 19:54.492
<i>because food is</i>
<i>100% not available.</i>

19:54.494 --> 19:55.359
(laughter)

19:55.361 --> 19:57.461
That's it!

19:57.463 --> 20:00.164
<i>Ha ha ha ha ha.</i>
<i>Ah ha ha.</i>

20:00.166 --> 20:02.066
<i>How about</i>
<i>a little dark humor?</i>

20:02.068 --> 20:04.535
<i>10 minutes ago, I initiated</i>
<i>an engine failure</i>

20:04.537 --> 20:06.837
<i>which will make the plane</i>
<i>lose hydraulics,</i>

20:06.839 --> 20:08.639
<i>release shrapnel</i>
<i>into the ductwork,</i>

20:08.641 --> 20:10.708
<i>and start</i>
<i>an uncontainable fire.</i>

20:10.710 --> 20:11.842
(all gasp)

20:11.844 --> 20:13.511
<i>And for my closing joke,</i>

20:13.513 --> 20:15.680
<i>a 30,000 foot drop</i>
<i>to your death.</i>

20:15.682 --> 20:18.516
<i>Thank you,</i>
<i>you're a wonderful audience.</i>

20:18.518 --> 20:21.519
(all screaming, alarm ringing)

20:21.521 --> 20:23.754
You see my set?

20:23.756 --> 20:25.323
I killed!

20:25.325 --> 20:27.258
Yah!

20:27.260 --> 20:28.726
(bleep) me.

20:28.728 --> 20:31.295
(screaming)

20:41.507 --> 20:44.742
(laughter)

20:44.744 --> 20:46.210
They're...

20:46.212 --> 20:47.578
laughing.

20:47.580 --> 20:50.248
(laughing)

20:50.250 --> 20:52.216
They're all laughing.

20:52.218 --> 20:54.619
Oh...
I see a white light.

20:54.621 --> 20:56.921
White light be all,
"Um, can you come towards me,

20:56.923 --> 20:58.689
if it's not too much trouble?"

20:58.691 --> 21:02.226
Black light be like,
"Get your ass over here!"

21:02.228 --> 21:04.228
Bye! Have a great time!
