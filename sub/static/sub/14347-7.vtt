WEBVTT

00:05.634 --> 00:06.733
Hey, Sean,
spot me, buddy.

00:06.768 --> 00:08.167
Yeah, Yeah.
Jesus Christ, look at you.

00:08.202 --> 00:10.596
What, you been working out like crazy?
What's going on?

00:10.634 --> 00:12.234
Well, firefighter calendar
shoots next week.

00:12.269 --> 00:13.385
You're doing
that thing again?

00:13.420 --> 00:14.466
Yeah.
Fourth year in a row.

00:14.501 --> 00:17.401
They want me so bad,
they let me pick my own month.

00:17.436 --> 00:18.868
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:18.903 --> 00:20.265
I don't know, man.

00:20.300 --> 00:21.501
That always seemed
a little gay.

00:21.536 --> 00:22.699
What? Are you kidding?

00:22.734 --> 00:24.467
You get one month
in that calendar,

00:24.502 --> 00:26.200
you're looking
at a whole year of ass.

00:26.235 --> 00:27.499
Come on.

00:27.534 --> 00:29.334
I'm telling you.
They come at me in waves.

00:29.369 --> 00:31.900
So you think I can get in it?

00:31.935 --> 00:33.084
Into what, the calendar?

00:33.119 --> 00:34.199
You just said it was gay.

00:34.234 --> 00:36.350
Well, yeah, but maybe it's gay
in a good way.

00:36.385 --> 00:38.467
Yeah, the kind of gay
that gets you straight sex.

00:38.502 --> 00:39.666
Yeah, it is.

00:39.701 --> 00:42.300
I'll put in a good word.
Little late in the day,

00:42.335 --> 00:43.701
but I'll see
what I can do.

00:43.736 --> 00:44.666
Whatever.
No big deal.

00:44.701 --> 00:46.234
- Hey, you guys see Tommy yet?
- No.

00:46.269 --> 00:47.632
Not yet, chief.

00:47.667 --> 00:49.801
Maybe he's outside
talking to another dead girl.

00:49.836 --> 00:51.165
Excuse me?

00:51.200 --> 00:53.200
What, I'm the only one
that thought that was weird?

00:53.235 --> 00:54.951
Yeah, come on, chief.
It was a little creepy.

00:54.986 --> 00:57.060
You don't think
Tommy's cracking up a bit?

00:57.095 --> 00:59.134
Listen, you two,
that was one incident.

00:59.169 --> 01:00.165
Look, chief--

01:00.200 --> 01:01.667
I got nothing but love
for Tommy.

01:01.702 --> 01:03.099
He's a great guy,
he's our brother,

01:03.134 --> 01:05.033
but that does nothing
to change the fact

01:05.068 --> 01:06.933
that he had a very long,
very animated chat

01:06.968 --> 01:08.232
with a very dead little girl.

01:08.267 --> 01:10.534
It doesn't take a shrink,
you know what I'm saying?

01:10.569 --> 01:12.651
And that's none of
your business, Rivera, huh?

01:12.686 --> 01:14.699
Yeah, okay. Well, uh,
how about when he flips out

01:14.734 --> 01:17.401
in the middle of our next
big fire, and I wind up dead?

01:17.436 --> 01:18.267
Is it my business then?

01:22.367 --> 01:24.200
Just tell him
I was looking for him, huh?

01:24.235 --> 01:26.998
Yeah, all right, chief.

01:27.029 --> 01:28.818
Jesus, I don't want
to be an asshole, but--

01:28.869 --> 01:31.401
Hey, look, don't sweat it.
I get it.

01:31.494 --> 01:33.268
- Let's go again, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.200
Tour starts at 9:00, Tommy,
not quarter to 10.

01:36.235 --> 01:37.165
I'm sorry, man.

01:37.200 --> 01:38.833
This isn't about you and me.

01:38.868 --> 01:41.234
George had to be at
his kids' school this morning.

01:41.269 --> 01:43.601
He hung on for 45 minutes,
but you didn't even call.

01:43.636 --> 01:45.200
I'm sorry. It won't
happen again, man.

01:45.235 --> 01:46.532
Okay? I'm sorry.

01:46.567 --> 01:48.232
What's going on
with you?

01:48.267 --> 01:50.484
I just-- Uh... I need
more vacation time.

01:50.519 --> 01:52.701
I already ate my regular
vacation days up.

01:52.748 --> 01:53.545
I-- I don't know.

01:53.589 --> 01:55.349
Do you ever think
about going downtown?

01:55.402 --> 01:56.566
What do you mean?

01:56.601 --> 01:57.766
There's a guy downtown.

01:57.801 --> 01:59.467
He's some sort
of a shrink, I guess.

01:59.502 --> 02:00.666
You go down and tell him

02:00.701 --> 02:02.501
you feel a little shaky,
about to crack up,

02:02.536 --> 02:03.632
boom, two weeks.

02:03.667 --> 02:04.917
- Two weeks? Wow.
- Yeah.

02:04.952 --> 02:06.132
I mean, I did it myself.

02:06.167 --> 02:08.632
- You were feeling a little, uh--?
- No, no, no.

02:08.667 --> 02:10.868
My wife wanted to go on some
New England foliage thing,

02:10.902 --> 02:12.432
you know, with the leaves
and that shit.

02:12.467 --> 02:15.100
It was the only way
I could get the time off.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.801
What would I say, you know?

02:16.836 --> 02:18.199
You make something up.

02:18.234 --> 02:20.267
I mean, you go down there
and tell him you--

02:20.302 --> 02:22.067
You can't sleep,
you got the shakes.

02:22.102 --> 02:23.132
Right.

02:23.167 --> 02:24.768
I mean, what's the worst
that can happen?

02:24.803 --> 02:26.132
Even if you don't
get time off,

02:26.167 --> 02:27.768
at least you get
to talk to somebody,

02:27.803 --> 02:29.602
if you need to
talk to somebody.

02:29.637 --> 02:31.401
Who says I need
to talk to somebody?

02:31.436 --> 02:32.499
I'm just saying...

02:32.534 --> 02:34.801
If you need to talk to somebody.

02:36.167 --> 02:37.167
I'll think about it.

02:37.202 --> 02:38.668
Thanks.

02:38.703 --> 02:40.134
Yeah.

03:36.401 --> 03:37.467
Jesus.

03:37.502 --> 03:38.499
Hey.

03:38.534 --> 03:39.734
- Whoa, whoa.
- I'm sorry.

03:39.769 --> 03:40.834
Hey, Steve.

03:40.869 --> 03:41.865
Hey, Tommy.

03:41.900 --> 03:42.998
What's going on,
man?

03:43.033 --> 03:44.234
Not much, man. I'm just working.

03:44.269 --> 03:45.432
- How you been?
- Pretty good.

03:45.467 --> 03:46.965
- Oh, you're down here now.
- Yeah.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.134
Wow. I barely even recognized
you in the suit and the tie.

03:50.169 --> 03:52.567
Yeah, I thought I was gonna
get out of the department

03:52.602 --> 03:54.667
after my accident,
but no such luck, you know?

03:54.702 --> 03:56.932
They hooked me back in.
Desk job.

03:56.967 --> 03:59.100
Putting out different kinds
of fires now.

03:59.135 --> 04:01.134
- Yeah.
- What you doing down here?

04:01.169 --> 04:02.632
Um...

04:02.667 --> 04:04.733
I'm, uh... Me and the guys--

04:04.768 --> 04:06.634
You remember Vito Costello
from my house?

04:06.669 --> 04:07.699
- Died 9/11.
- Yeah.

04:07.734 --> 04:09.332
Me and the guys are, uh--

04:09.367 --> 04:11.801
We're trying to get a, uh,
a jogging path named after him.

04:11.836 --> 04:13.768
- Yeah, I remember Vito.
- Yeah.

04:13.803 --> 04:15.701
He was--
He was a huge jogger.

04:15.736 --> 04:17.199
Well, listen, uh...

04:17.233 --> 04:19.834
why don't you give it to me?
I'll just push it right through.

04:19.869 --> 04:22.434
Well, the thing is, I promised
his-- His widow that--

04:22.469 --> 04:23.466
It's no problem.

04:23.501 --> 04:25.100
I can push it
right through for you.

04:25.135 --> 04:26.200
I'll push it right through--

04:26.235 --> 04:27.566
Hey, Tommy.

04:27.601 --> 04:28.699
How you doing, man?

04:28.734 --> 04:30.617
- Good to see you.
- What's going on?

04:30.652 --> 04:32.466
This is a health form,
Tommy.

04:32.501 --> 04:34.734
You know what? The guys knew
I was coming down--

04:34.769 --> 04:36.132
it's like a joke.

04:36.167 --> 04:38.667
Oh, listen, it's no problem.
I don't need a petition.

04:38.702 --> 04:40.667
I'll push it through
by the end of the week.

04:40.702 --> 04:41.733
Yeah?

04:41.768 --> 04:43.467
That'd be great.
That'd be huge.

04:43.502 --> 04:44.833
Hey, it's for Vito, right?

04:44.868 --> 04:46.334
- That's right.
- I'll take care of it.

04:46.369 --> 04:47.918
- I'll call you.
- Thanks, man.

04:47.953 --> 04:49.467
All right.
Take it easy, Tommy.

04:49.502 --> 04:50.467
- Thanks.
- All right.

04:50.502 --> 04:51.367
See you.

05:02.900 --> 05:03.933
Next!

05:12.667 --> 05:13.534
Next!

05:16.501 --> 05:18.250
- Gavin, 62nd truck.
- Ahem. Yeah.

05:18.285 --> 05:20.000
What seems to be the problem?

05:20.035 --> 05:21.766
Well, uh--

05:21.801 --> 05:24.501
been, uh... Been having
some trouble sleeping.

05:24.536 --> 05:26.332
That's it?

05:26.367 --> 05:28.783
Um, some other, uh...

05:28.818 --> 05:31.200
you know, kind of...

05:31.235 --> 05:32.900
Shh. Gotcha.

05:36.467 --> 05:37.865
I think you're okay
for full duty.

05:37.900 --> 05:40.433
Just take these,
check back with me in a month.

05:40.468 --> 05:42.967
Direction and dosages
will be on the bottle.

05:47.501 --> 05:49.199
That-- That's it?

05:49.234 --> 05:51.734
You want to talk or something?

05:54.267 --> 05:55.232
No.

05:55.267 --> 05:58.265
Nah. No, I'm good.

05:58.300 --> 05:59.734
You're not seeing dead people,
are you?

05:59.769 --> 06:02.499
No.

06:02.534 --> 06:04.534
Because word's gotten out,
you see dead people,

06:04.569 --> 06:06.534
you're in for an automatic
two-week vacation.

06:06.569 --> 06:07.898
I got three, four guys a week

06:07.933 --> 06:10.100
coming in here
seeing dead people.

06:10.135 --> 06:11.399
I-- I--

06:11.434 --> 06:13.734
I just thought maybe I could
use, you know...

06:13.769 --> 06:14.933
A couple weeks off, that's all.

06:14.968 --> 06:16.932
Try the pills first.

06:16.967 --> 06:19.432
Okay. Um, here's the thing.

06:19.467 --> 06:22.634
I can't, uh...
I can't really read these.

06:22.669 --> 06:24.100
You can't sleep, right?

06:24.135 --> 06:25.517
Right.

06:25.552 --> 06:26.909
Depressed?

06:26.944 --> 06:28.232
Uh, yeah.

06:28.267 --> 06:29.767
What's that one?

06:29.802 --> 06:31.267
Can't get it up?

06:31.302 --> 06:32.632
Oh, no, no.

06:32.667 --> 06:33.868
I don't have that problem.

06:33.903 --> 06:34.933
Oh, sorry.

06:36.467 --> 06:37.766
Okay.

06:37.801 --> 06:40.017
Well, you know...

06:40.052 --> 06:41.926
You never know.

06:41.961 --> 06:43.381
Thanks, doc.

06:43.416 --> 06:44.801
Hey, you drink?

06:44.836 --> 06:46.532
Um...

06:46.567 --> 06:47.799
not really.

06:47.834 --> 06:51.033
Well, don't take that stuff
with booze.

06:51.068 --> 06:52.134
It won't be good.

06:52.169 --> 06:53.901
Next!

06:53.936 --> 06:55.634
Okay.

07:10.900 --> 07:12.000
Hey, Rog.

07:13.401 --> 07:14.667
How's it going?

07:17.734 --> 07:19.132
Asshole.

07:19.167 --> 07:21.167
Look, I told you
I didn't want to see you.

07:21.202 --> 07:22.232
Why are you here?

07:22.267 --> 07:24.332
Because this is bullshit,
babe!

07:24.367 --> 07:25.932
Come on. We were
going along just fine.

07:25.967 --> 07:28.200
Until you had a bunch of friends
beat up my ex-husband.

07:28.235 --> 07:30.265
First of all,
I had nothing to do with that.

07:30.300 --> 07:32.701
And second, it wasn't a bunch,
it was... three guys.

07:32.736 --> 07:34.265
Hello.

07:34.300 --> 07:36.501
Oh, hey, sorry.
I didn't know you had company.

07:36.536 --> 07:37.499
He knew.

07:37.534 --> 07:38.932
He saw me pull up.

07:38.967 --> 07:41.167
You know what? I didn't
come to start a fight.

07:41.202 --> 07:42.132
What do you want?

07:42.167 --> 07:43.633
I got that part
for the sink.

07:43.668 --> 07:45.065
Wanted to make sure
it works.

07:45.100 --> 07:46.634
- Now's not a good time.
- Two seconds.

07:46.669 --> 07:48.001
Oh, you're so innocent.

07:48.036 --> 07:49.299
- Mr. Nice Guy.
- What?

07:49.334 --> 07:51.801
Tell her about what you
did to me in the kitchen.

07:51.836 --> 07:53.200
About holding my head
over the stove.

07:53.235 --> 07:54.432
- What?!
- Yeah.

07:54.467 --> 07:56.199
You put his head over the stove?

07:56.234 --> 07:57.801
I don't remember
that particular detail.

07:57.836 --> 07:59.033
- Oh, please.
- Hey, Mom.

07:59.068 --> 08:00.534
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

08:00.569 --> 08:01.868
Can I get a drink?

08:01.903 --> 08:03.132
Sure. Go ahead.

08:03.167 --> 08:04.432
You know,
Connor was there.

08:04.464 --> 08:06.473
He probably remembers exactly
what happened, right, son?

08:06.515 --> 08:08.723
Yeah. You mean when
you and Roger were fighting?

08:08.769 --> 08:09.898
Right.

08:09.933 --> 08:11.900
Tell your mother, um,
who hit who first.

08:16.234 --> 08:18.000
Roger threw the first punch.

08:18.035 --> 08:19.232
There you go.

08:19.267 --> 08:20.350
What?
That's bullshit.

08:20.385 --> 08:21.826
Roger, watch your language.

08:21.861 --> 08:23.614
Yeah, asshole.
Sorry. Sorry.

08:23.649 --> 08:25.332
I did not throw the first punch.

08:25.367 --> 08:27.900
Listen, I don't know what's
going on here, young man,

08:27.935 --> 08:29.701
but I suggest you tell
your mother right now

08:29.736 --> 08:30.667
what exactly
happened.

08:35.900 --> 08:37.200
Roger started it.

08:37.235 --> 08:38.466
See?
He's lying!

08:38.501 --> 08:40.933
You know what? Don't call
my kid a liar. Okay, pal?

08:40.967 --> 08:42.599
Okay, Tommy, just go.

08:42.634 --> 08:45.300
- You sure?
- Yes. I can handle this.

08:45.335 --> 08:46.265
Goodbye.

08:46.300 --> 08:48.234
- Thanks, pal.
- Nice teamwork.

08:49.701 --> 08:51.000
Okay, honey, just go.

08:52.777 --> 08:54.822
Lookit, I talked to
my ex-brother-in-law, Roger.

08:54.885 --> 08:56.909
He's a detective.
He told me you were involved.

08:56.949 --> 08:58.472
I think he knows
what he's talking about.

08:58.486 --> 08:58.947
Wake up.

08:58.968 --> 09:00.566
It's such bullshit!

09:00.601 --> 09:02.401
You want to know what's
really happening here?

09:02.436 --> 09:03.601
No! Could you just leave?

09:03.636 --> 09:04.834
No!
Listen to me!

09:06.033 --> 09:07.666
It's that asshole
across the street.

09:07.701 --> 09:09.501
Your ex-husband has been
trying to break us apart

09:09.536 --> 09:11.898
since day one.

09:11.933 --> 09:13.299
Just answer one question.

09:13.334 --> 09:14.734
And you better tell the truth,
Roger,

09:14.769 --> 09:16.401
because if you lie, I will know.

09:16.436 --> 09:18.032
Okay.

09:18.067 --> 09:21.768
Did you have anything to do with
those guys beating up Tommy?

09:21.803 --> 09:24.467
Define "anything."

09:28.667 --> 09:30.601
Hey.
Hey, I need you to cut it.

09:30.636 --> 09:31.699
Hey. Hey!

09:31.734 --> 09:33.100
What's the problem?

09:35.401 --> 09:36.501
Nothing. Never mind.

09:36.536 --> 09:37.466
Sorry.

09:37.501 --> 09:38.933
Hey, uh...
Bob Shinsky.

09:38.968 --> 09:39.967
Tom Gavin.

09:40.002 --> 09:40.932
How are you?

09:40.981 --> 09:43.237
- You're the firefighter, right?
- Yeah.

09:43.334 --> 09:45.601
It looks like you had a fire
of your own recently.

09:45.636 --> 09:46.799
It's kind of ironic.

09:46.834 --> 09:49.933
But I want you to know
I think it's great.

09:49.968 --> 09:51.366
Your work, uh, you know,

09:51.401 --> 09:54.000
it takes a lot of guts to handle
that job, and I'm impressed.

09:54.035 --> 09:55.099
Thank you.

09:55.134 --> 09:56.367
What-- What do you do?

09:56.402 --> 09:57.501
I'm a psychotherapist.

09:57.536 --> 09:58.601
Oh, you're a shrink?

09:58.636 --> 10:00.499
Guilty, yeah.

10:00.534 --> 10:02.601
That's funny.
You're the second one today.

10:02.636 --> 10:03.801
Hey, let me ask you something.

10:03.836 --> 10:04.766
I got these pills.

10:04.801 --> 10:06.265
Could you take
a look at these?

10:06.300 --> 10:09.534
Let me just put this
down for a second.

10:10.334 --> 10:12.134
Are these good?

10:13.768 --> 10:14.766
Oh, yeah.

10:14.801 --> 10:16.165
Well, these are all fine,
I guess.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.300
I mean... You know, they don't
work for everyone.

10:18.335 --> 10:19.299
Right.

10:19.334 --> 10:20.900
Now, would I take them
separately,

10:20.935 --> 10:22.265
or all at the same time?

10:22.300 --> 10:23.699
Well, I don't think you'd want

10:23.734 --> 10:25.933
to take all three of these
medications at the same time...

10:25.968 --> 10:27.898
- No?
- No, not unless you wanted to be

10:27.933 --> 10:29.983
a really sleepy, happy guy
with an erection.

10:30.018 --> 10:32.033
No, the erection thing,
that was a mistake.

10:32.068 --> 10:33.501
So these are good?

10:33.536 --> 10:34.766
Uh, I guess.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.300
I don't usually prescribe
anything

10:36.335 --> 10:37.632
unless it's a last resort.

10:37.667 --> 10:39.333
There are people
in my profession,

10:39.368 --> 10:41.301
- they hand out meds like candy.
- Yeah.

10:41.336 --> 10:43.199
I, uh... I think
talking one-on-one

10:43.234 --> 10:45.132
is much more effective
in the long term,

10:45.167 --> 10:47.868
so consider that before you dig
into your stash there.

10:47.903 --> 10:49.467
All right, thanks, doc.
Appreciate it.

10:49.502 --> 10:51.334
- Oh, thanks.
- See you around.

10:51.369 --> 10:52.632
Excuse me. I...

10:52.667 --> 10:55.434
I was admiring your deck
out back the other day,

10:55.469 --> 10:56.766
and I was--

10:56.801 --> 10:59.267
I'm actually thinking about
putting one on myself.

10:59.302 --> 11:00.399
Yeah. Yeah.

11:00.434 --> 11:01.699
So, uh, who did yours?

11:01.734 --> 11:03.768
I did.
Me and the guys from my crew.

11:03.803 --> 11:05.032
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:05.068 --> 11:07.293
What are you thinking of doing,
thinking of spending?

11:07.323 --> 11:08.406
I don't know.

11:08.434 --> 11:09.900
A thousand, maybe 1,500, but--

11:09.935 --> 11:10.865
Yeah.

11:10.900 --> 11:12.499
I don't know, man.

11:12.534 --> 11:14.701
It's just, you know--
Really taking a week's work

11:14.736 --> 11:17.000
and just compressing it
into two days.

11:17.035 --> 11:18.401
I'd have to
take a look at--

11:18.436 --> 11:19.366
17-- Maybe 2000.

11:19.401 --> 11:20.401
2000. That's more like it.

11:20.436 --> 11:21.666
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:21.701 --> 11:24.134
Let me talk to the guys,
and I'll get back to you.

11:24.169 --> 11:25.699
- I'm very serious.
- Okay. All right.

11:25.734 --> 11:28.134
Nice to talk to you, doc.
I'll get right back at you.

11:28.169 --> 11:29.751
So nice
to see you.

11:29.786 --> 11:31.299
Two grand for a porch?

11:31.334 --> 11:33.133
Last one we did,
we got what, 600 bucks?

11:33.168 --> 11:34.933
Who is this guy?
The king of chumps?

11:34.968 --> 11:36.165
Some shrink, you know?

11:36.221 --> 11:37.966
I figure we'd get
Charlie Walsh's cousin

11:38.008 --> 11:40.433
to get the lumber for 300 bones,
divide the rest up.

11:40.477 --> 11:41.259
You in?

11:41.296 --> 11:43.029
That kind of money,
I'll show up in a tux.

11:43.068 --> 11:43.998
Franco?

11:44.033 --> 11:45.865
- In.
- I'll do it.

11:45.900 --> 11:47.065
Let me
tell you something, kid.

11:47.100 --> 11:48.933
First time doing a porch,
you work for free.

11:48.968 --> 11:50.099
Let me clarify further.

11:50.134 --> 11:51.533
Not only do you not get paid,

11:51.568 --> 11:52.898
you generally do all the work

11:52.933 --> 11:54.933
while we sit around drinking
beer and shooting the shit.

11:54.968 --> 11:56.032
And you buy the beer.

11:56.067 --> 11:57.567
Yeah, a couple of
those suitcase things.

11:57.602 --> 11:58.632
MGD is good.

11:59.371 --> 12:01.281
Guys, I just remembered
I'm busy.

12:02.957 --> 12:04.131
- Bill, you in?
- No.

12:04.167 --> 12:05.967
- Why not?
- Because.

12:06.002 --> 12:07.284
Because why?

12:07.319 --> 12:08.532
Because because.

12:08.567 --> 12:09.733
"Because, be--" What are we,

12:09.768 --> 12:11.567
in the land of Oz
all of a sudden?

12:11.602 --> 12:12.632
He is.

12:12.667 --> 12:13.865
Engine.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.167
Let's go.
It's party time.

12:19.467 --> 12:21.267
Hey, did you make
that call for me yet

12:21.302 --> 12:22.265
about the calendar
thing?

12:22.300 --> 12:23.699
Yeah. They want
to see your picture.

12:23.734 --> 12:25.534
- Well, I don't have one.
- You got a camera?

12:25.569 --> 12:26.699
Bring it in.
I'll take it.

12:26.734 --> 12:28.099
What are you ladies
talking about?

12:28.143 --> 12:30.020
Firefighter calendar.
I'm doing it again this year.

12:30.052 --> 12:31.444
He gets to choose
his own month.

12:31.469 --> 12:32.432
Great.

12:32.467 --> 12:34.667
So which month
are you going for?

12:34.702 --> 12:35.865
I'd try for February,

12:35.900 --> 12:37.466
work that whole
Valentine's Day thing.

12:37.501 --> 12:40.434
Nah. Common mistake.
Shortest month of the year.

12:40.496 --> 12:41.429
So, what's a good month?

12:41.474 --> 12:42.993
You definitely don't
wanna be December.

12:43.033 --> 12:45.234
Nobody pays attention till
the last 30 days of the year.

12:45.269 --> 12:47.634
You wanna be in
the first four or five months

12:47.669 --> 12:48.833
to maximize booty potential.

12:48.868 --> 12:50.467
I'm thinking April, May,
in there, you know?

12:50.502 --> 12:52.318
It's spring.
Winter clothes come off.

12:52.353 --> 12:54.134
Chicks are thinking
about getting laid.

12:54.169 --> 12:55.099
Yeah?

12:55.134 --> 12:56.499
Interesting.

12:56.534 --> 12:59.634
Yeah, it's a science,
and I'm the mad scientist.

13:12.667 --> 13:15.434
Davey, stay close
to the squawk box, all right?

13:15.469 --> 13:17.332
Battalion 1-5 to 1-5 Alpha,

13:17.367 --> 13:20.601
transmit a 10-75
at the box on the corner.

13:20.636 --> 13:21.865
My husband's in there!

13:21.900 --> 13:23.132
Señor, my husband's
in there!

13:23.167 --> 13:25.183
Tommy, make sure
you get that smoke.

13:25.218 --> 13:27.200
See if there's any smoke
in the shaft.

13:37.267 --> 13:38.334
Hey, pal!

13:38.369 --> 13:39.834
Hey!

13:52.401 --> 13:53.399
Hey, Garrity.

13:53.434 --> 13:54.733
Check it out, bro.

13:54.768 --> 13:56.734
We should get that shot
for the calendar people.

13:56.769 --> 13:58.001
- Oh, hey, good idea.
- Yeah.

13:58.036 --> 13:59.234
Where do you want to do it?

13:59.269 --> 14:01.065
Uh, here is good.

14:01.100 --> 14:02.800
You should take off your coat.

14:02.835 --> 14:04.466
Hey, should I
do it standing

14:04.501 --> 14:06.167
or do that, like,
crouching thing?

14:06.202 --> 14:07.167
No, no, no, just stand.

14:07.202 --> 14:09.232
Okay.

14:09.267 --> 14:11.100
And lift up your shirt.
They'll want to see

14:11.135 --> 14:12.065
some abs.

14:12.100 --> 14:13.933
Yeah, that's good.

14:13.968 --> 14:15.032
Yeah.

14:15.067 --> 14:16.499
Hey, what you guys doing?

14:16.534 --> 14:19.601
Just, uh, taking a picture
for the firefighter calendar.

14:19.636 --> 14:21.434
Not like that, jackass.
Use one hand.

14:21.469 --> 14:23.766
How's that?

14:23.801 --> 14:25.768
So this calendar,
what are they doing?

14:25.803 --> 14:27.134
Like an all-geek theme
this year?

14:27.169 --> 14:28.634
That's real funny.

14:28.669 --> 14:30.065
Look, take your hand,

14:30.100 --> 14:31.600
put it under your shirt,
all right?

14:31.635 --> 14:33.100
Then you lift it up,
like that, okay?

14:33.135 --> 14:34.932
That's good.

14:34.967 --> 14:37.200
There you go.
Yeah, like that.

14:37.235 --> 14:39.101
Like you just
fought a fire.

14:39.136 --> 14:40.967
You're cooling down,
right?

14:41.002 --> 14:42.432
Now, put your head back

14:42.467 --> 14:45.401
like you're getting that
first breath of fresh air.

14:45.436 --> 14:46.768
No, no.
Watch me.

14:46.803 --> 14:48.200
Ready?

14:49.401 --> 14:51.132
- Oh, God, that's really good.
- Nice.

14:51.167 --> 14:52.567
Now lean forward a little bit.

14:52.602 --> 14:53.733
Let's get some--

14:53.769 --> 14:55.587
let's get some
muscle rippling going on.

14:55.607 --> 14:56.137
Oh, yeah.

14:56.167 --> 14:57.267
Up the shirt
a little bit.

14:57.302 --> 14:58.934
Let's show
a little nipple.

14:58.969 --> 15:00.532
Give the girls
a thrill.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.267
Hurry, Franco.
We're losing our light.

15:02.302 --> 15:03.232
There you go.

15:03.267 --> 15:04.599
Chief, any suggestions?

15:04.634 --> 15:06.634
Yeah, I got a suggestion
for the three of you.

15:06.669 --> 15:08.551
Go right from here
to the medical office,

15:08.586 --> 15:10.434
and you have
your testosterone level checked,

15:10.469 --> 15:12.232
'cause you're all down a quart.

15:12.267 --> 15:13.867
Come on.
We're taking up and going back.

15:13.902 --> 15:15.467
What the hell
is the matter with you?

15:15.502 --> 15:16.334
Put your shirt back in.

15:19.100 --> 15:20.065
Okay, ready?

15:20.100 --> 15:20.967
Now, behind the head...

15:23.134 --> 15:25.299
Oh, so listen to this.

15:25.334 --> 15:28.183
I'm out with the wife the other
night. We go to a show.

15:28.218 --> 15:31.033
Afterwards, we're walking
to the car, look into this bar,

15:31.068 --> 15:33.884
and who do I see
but our very own little probie

15:33.919 --> 15:36.701
making out with some broad
to beat the band.

15:36.736 --> 15:37.865
- So?
- So...

15:37.900 --> 15:39.501
this chick's old enough
to be his mother.

15:39.536 --> 15:41.300
Oh, God, I just
caught a chill.

15:41.335 --> 15:42.766
- How old?
- I don't know.

15:42.801 --> 15:45.200
I didn't have time to cut her
in half, count the rings,

15:45.235 --> 15:46.801
but she was pretty old
for him.

15:46.836 --> 15:48.334
I'm guessing late 40s.

15:48.369 --> 15:49.599
Wow. Really?

15:49.634 --> 15:50.799
Oh, speak of the devil.

15:50.834 --> 15:52.351
- Hey, kid, your ears burning?
- Huh?

15:52.386 --> 15:54.110
Hey, you banging
some old broad?

15:54.145 --> 15:55.799
And if you are,
word of caution:

15:55.834 --> 15:57.834
A broken hip takes
a very long time to heal.

15:57.869 --> 15:59.968
I mean, she's not that old.
She's 46.

16:00.003 --> 16:01.735
Well, that's nothing
in dog years.

16:01.770 --> 16:03.802
Yeah, which probably
applies to her.

16:03.837 --> 16:05.835
Hey, you guys can
say whatever you want.

16:05.870 --> 16:07.799
I mean, Paula's older,
but she's great.

16:07.834 --> 16:10.033
She's the person who taught me
how to please a woman.

16:10.068 --> 16:12.534
Pleasing a woman?
Not possible, kid.

16:12.569 --> 16:13.666
No, I mean sexually.

16:13.701 --> 16:15.501
She taught me how to do
the Venus Butterfly.

16:15.536 --> 16:17.132
What the hell's that?

16:17.167 --> 16:19.167
It's a sexual thing.
A position, I guess.

16:19.202 --> 16:20.232
And?

16:20.267 --> 16:23.033
So you're doing oral
on a chick--

16:23.068 --> 16:24.334
- Is that required?
- Yeah.

16:24.369 --> 16:25.566
I'm out, but keep going.

16:25.601 --> 16:27.499
So you start
with just the tongue,

16:27.534 --> 16:29.299
and then you put two fingers
in her area,

16:29.334 --> 16:31.434
and then you have another finger
working the other area.

16:31.469 --> 16:32.466
Yeah, I've done that.

16:32.501 --> 16:33.865
Didn't know it had a name,
though.

16:33.900 --> 16:35.701
Wait a second.
What areas are we talking about?

16:35.736 --> 16:37.100
And since when
are there two areas?

16:37.135 --> 16:38.099
My wife's only got one,

16:38.134 --> 16:39.766
not that I've seen it
recently.

16:39.801 --> 16:41.833
I don't know.
Maybe she's subdivided.

16:41.868 --> 16:44.067
I think we're talking about
the back and the front area.

16:44.102 --> 16:45.699
Yeah, that's right.

16:45.734 --> 16:47.099
So you put two fingers
in front

16:47.134 --> 16:48.768
and one in the back?
How's that work?

16:48.803 --> 16:50.351
Oh, it's easy.
You just...

16:50.386 --> 16:51.976
Does that look easy to you?

16:52.011 --> 16:53.532
Yeah, but I'm a bowler.

16:53.567 --> 16:55.567
Wait a second.
This actually works?

16:55.602 --> 16:56.532
Oh, yeah.

16:56.567 --> 16:58.601
It never fails.
Drives chicks crazy.

16:58.636 --> 17:00.401
Hey, I'm doing it.

17:00.465 --> 17:01.533
I'll give it a shot.

17:01.563 --> 17:03.653
- Thanks for the info, kid.
- You're welcome.

17:03.701 --> 17:05.900
By the way, you're still not
getting paid for the deck.

17:05.935 --> 17:07.998
Waits on the pitch, 0-2.

17:08.032 --> 17:10.501
Oh! Duffy fired it
inside that time,

17:10.536 --> 17:12.833
and it's inside
and low.

17:12.867 --> 17:15.666
Ha-ha, one ball
and two strikes.

17:17.401 --> 17:19.401
Folks have
their rally caps on.

17:19.435 --> 17:21.366
Hear the crowd
getting into it.

17:21.401 --> 17:23.768
Adam Kennedy actually
tightened this one up earlier

17:23.803 --> 17:28.699
with that 2-run
home-run blast.

17:28.734 --> 17:32.367
He's been consistently getting
around late on the pitcher...

17:32.402 --> 17:33.733
Hey, Tom.

17:33.768 --> 17:36.567
I know you got a lot on your
mind, but we got some problems.

17:36.602 --> 17:38.834
Are you getting some park
named after Vito?

17:38.869 --> 17:40.033
How'd you find out
about that?

17:40.068 --> 17:41.684
Just tell me.
Are you?

17:41.719 --> 17:43.009
It's not a park, okay?

17:43.044 --> 17:44.265
It's a jogging path.

17:44.300 --> 17:45.500
That's all
well and good,

17:45.535 --> 17:46.666
but now Bobby Vincent's upset

17:46.712 --> 17:48.753
because you're not getting
anything named after him.

17:48.777 --> 17:50.596
What, you think it's easy?
Like one phone call?

17:50.626 --> 17:52.686
- It's a complicated process.
- I understand that.

17:52.734 --> 17:54.350
I'm just telling you
what's happening here.

17:54.385 --> 17:55.932
You can't give to one
and not the other.

17:55.967 --> 17:57.967
Now Vito and Bobby aren't even
talking to each other.

17:58.002 --> 17:58.965
It's a mess.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.300
Ask Bobby what he wants named.

18:00.335 --> 18:01.566
I'll see if I can do something.

18:01.601 --> 18:03.766
Tommy, you're missing
the point, okay?

18:03.801 --> 18:06.099
'Cause if he's gonna ask,
it's not the same.

18:06.134 --> 18:08.734
You guys are so far up my ass,
it's not even funny.

18:08.769 --> 18:09.933
- Shh.
- No, no, you shh, okay?

18:09.968 --> 18:11.300
- Chill.
- What the hell?

18:12.401 --> 18:13.417
Hello?

18:13.452 --> 18:14.399
Tommy?

18:14.434 --> 18:15.434
Sheila?

18:15.469 --> 18:16.399
Tommy?

18:16.434 --> 18:18.032
I know. I'm sorry.

18:18.067 --> 18:19.334
I should have called you first.

18:19.369 --> 18:21.334
What's-- What's going on?

18:21.369 --> 18:23.132
I'm a mess.

18:23.167 --> 18:24.566
Why? What's wrong?

18:24.601 --> 18:27.100
Well, just-- I've been a wreck
since the other night,

18:27.135 --> 18:28.868
you know, when you
drove me home.

18:28.903 --> 18:30.566
Yeah. I'm gonna grab my jacket.

18:30.601 --> 18:32.000
I'll meet you outside
in the driveway.

18:32.035 --> 18:33.965
I'll wait for you right here.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.367
Uh, just wait outside,
all right?

18:35.402 --> 18:36.434
Two seconds.

18:38.334 --> 18:39.617
Sheila...

18:39.652 --> 18:40.865
Tommy!

18:40.900 --> 18:42.517
Tommy, what's going on?

18:42.552 --> 18:44.134
What are you doing?

18:44.169 --> 18:45.099
Nothing.

18:45.134 --> 18:46.367
What do you mean, nothing?

18:46.402 --> 18:47.499
Nothing.

18:47.534 --> 18:49.434
She said something
about the other night.

18:49.469 --> 18:50.534
What is she talking about?

18:50.569 --> 18:51.801
What?
Just tell me.

18:53.734 --> 18:55.317
Tell me.

18:55.352 --> 18:56.865
It's Ryan.

18:56.900 --> 18:59.501
He's been calling her,
like, every other day.

18:59.536 --> 19:01.167
It's been relentless.

19:01.202 --> 19:02.201
Ryan?

19:02.236 --> 19:03.165
Yeah.

19:03.200 --> 19:04.165
- Asshole.
- Prick.

19:04.200 --> 19:06.332
Wait a minute.
All right, so...

19:06.367 --> 19:08.534
Go out and talk to her.
Make sure she's okay.

19:08.569 --> 19:09.900
- All right.
- And, Tommy...

19:14.067 --> 19:15.032
Thanks, man.

19:15.067 --> 19:16.734
Don't worry about it.

19:20.234 --> 19:21.632
Hey.

19:21.667 --> 19:23.434
Let's, uh-- Let's jump
in the truck

19:23.469 --> 19:24.699
and head around the corner.

19:24.734 --> 19:26.000
Why? What is the matter
with you?

19:27.033 --> 19:28.200
It's-- It's Janet.

19:28.235 --> 19:29.366
She's, um...

19:29.401 --> 19:31.234
She's been spying on me lately.

19:31.269 --> 19:33.032
I don't want her to see
you and me

19:33.067 --> 19:34.868
and then start tying you
into all this crap.

19:34.903 --> 19:36.367
Okay? Come on.

19:36.402 --> 19:37.699
God.

19:37.734 --> 19:39.701
It's like a goddamn soap opera.

19:39.736 --> 19:40.701
Yeah, I know.

19:44.267 --> 19:45.300
Hey.

19:47.100 --> 19:48.065
Hey.

19:48.129 --> 19:49.077
How's it going?

19:49.122 --> 19:50.415
What happened
the other night?

19:50.469 --> 19:51.534
What?
What do you mean?

19:52.634 --> 19:54.666
What do I mean?
We're at the bar.

19:54.701 --> 19:56.833
We're having a great time,
and all of a sudden,

19:56.868 --> 19:59.100
you go to the bathroom,
and then you never come back.

19:59.135 --> 20:00.399
Yeah.

20:00.434 --> 20:03.234
You know, I had, like,
food poisoning or something...

20:03.269 --> 20:04.199
I guess.

20:04.234 --> 20:06.799
You think my girlfriend and I

20:06.834 --> 20:09.134
go around asking people
to sleep with us all the time?

20:12.006 --> 20:12.983
I'm sorry.

20:13.028 --> 20:15.509
I was just really uncomfortable
with the offer, you know?

20:15.569 --> 20:17.334
I've never done
anything like that before,

20:17.369 --> 20:18.766
I mean, had a three-way.

20:18.801 --> 20:21.601
So say that you're
uncomfortable.

20:21.636 --> 20:24.985
Don't just slink off
into the night.

20:25.020 --> 20:28.334
Look, you don't owe me
an apology.

20:28.369 --> 20:29.499
You saved my life.

20:29.534 --> 20:31.833
You don't owe me anything,

20:31.868 --> 20:34.232
but Geneva,
that's different, man.

20:34.267 --> 20:36.467
I mean, you owe her
an explanation, dude,

20:36.502 --> 20:39.799
- and I'm serious.
- Okay.

20:39.834 --> 20:42.234
Well, can I have her number,
and, you know, I'll call her--

20:42.269 --> 20:43.199
No, I think

20:43.234 --> 20:44.900
you should apologize
to her in person,

20:44.935 --> 20:46.901
since you
dissed her in person.

20:46.936 --> 20:48.868
Here's her address,
all right?

20:48.903 --> 20:51.734
Hey, make it right, man.

20:51.769 --> 20:52.968
I mean it.

20:53.003 --> 20:54.167
All right.

20:54.202 --> 20:55.566
Okay.

20:55.601 --> 20:57.467
I'm sorry, man.

20:57.502 --> 20:59.334
Just make it right.

21:09.933 --> 21:12.768
God, Tommy, nothing like
making it easy for me.

21:12.803 --> 21:14.601
It'll be better here,
believe me.

21:14.636 --> 21:15.666
What's up?

21:15.701 --> 21:17.065
Well, don't act
like I'm interrupting

21:17.100 --> 21:19.267
your big busy schedule
or something, all right?

21:19.302 --> 21:20.332
I'm not.

21:20.367 --> 21:23.084
I'm vulnerable.
Don't be such a dick.

21:23.119 --> 21:25.766
I'm not being a dick.
I'm sorry. Okay?

21:25.801 --> 21:28.100
You-- You want to talk
about the other night?

21:28.135 --> 21:30.151
Is that what you want
to talk about?

21:30.186 --> 21:32.109
I feel like I should
apologize to you.

21:32.144 --> 21:34.033
I mean, I attacked you
in the car.

21:34.068 --> 21:35.801
I mean, I feel like a slut.

21:35.836 --> 21:36.932
No. Come on.

21:36.967 --> 21:38.833
Not at all.
I mean, it wasn't like

21:38.868 --> 21:40.667
you actually had to fight
me off, you know?

21:40.702 --> 21:45.032
I know, but I feel
very guilty.

21:45.067 --> 21:47.567
I mean, there's, like,
millions of guys in the world,

21:47.602 --> 21:50.067
and then I go and I shove
my tongue down your throat.

21:50.102 --> 21:52.532
Look, you know what?

21:52.567 --> 21:54.134
Don't beat yourself up
over it, okay?

21:54.169 --> 21:55.165
It was--

21:55.200 --> 21:57.033
It was what it was,
and it's...

21:57.068 --> 21:59.632
in the past.

21:59.667 --> 22:01.234
Well, it can never
happen again.

22:01.269 --> 22:02.584
I mean,
that's for sure.

22:02.619 --> 22:03.900
No. Definitely,
no way.

22:03.935 --> 22:05.851
No, no.

22:05.886 --> 22:07.768
Nope.

22:12.667 --> 22:13.900
Okay...

22:13.935 --> 22:16.067
Okay...

22:16.102 --> 22:17.601
Wait, wait.

22:17.636 --> 22:19.100
This is crazy.

22:21.401 --> 22:22.334
All right.

22:35.100 --> 22:36.065
Hey.

22:36.100 --> 22:37.065
What's up?

22:37.100 --> 22:38.632
Are we the first ones here?

22:38.667 --> 22:41.265
Yeah, Lou and Tommy went
to go pick up the lumber.

22:41.300 --> 22:44.634
Hey, listen, Sean, I got a call
from the calendar people.

22:44.669 --> 22:45.799
Oh, yeah?

22:45.834 --> 22:47.434
Yeah, they took a look
at your pictures.

22:47.469 --> 22:49.534
It's a pass.
I'm sorry.

22:49.569 --> 22:51.432
You're kidding.

22:51.478 --> 22:52.766
What was the problem?

22:52.814 --> 22:55.196
Well, basically everything.
They said you were out of shape,

22:55.228 --> 22:56.897
your face sucked,
your hair looked weird.

22:56.925 --> 22:58.113
You know what? Screw them, okay?

22:58.143 --> 22:59.361
Like that calendar's a big deal.

22:59.402 --> 23:00.733
I never wanted
to be in it

23:00.768 --> 23:02.634
- in the first place.
- I'm kidding.

23:02.669 --> 23:03.833
What?

23:03.868 --> 23:05.199
- You're in.
- Really?

23:05.234 --> 23:07.750
Yeah. Congratulations,
Mr. December.

23:07.785 --> 23:10.267
December?
What, I don't get March?

23:10.302 --> 23:11.432
No, it doesn't work that way.

23:11.467 --> 23:13.134
Got to work your way
up the booty chain.

23:14.501 --> 23:15.534
Huh.

23:20.200 --> 23:21.634
Hey, anybody try
that Venus thing yet?

23:21.669 --> 23:22.599
- Not me.
- Nah.

23:22.634 --> 23:24.401
I did, last night.

23:24.436 --> 23:25.399
Yeah, and?

23:25.434 --> 23:27.132
Well, first of all,
it was a joke.

23:27.167 --> 23:29.501
I hooked up with this old
booty call of mine.

23:29.536 --> 23:30.998
So we start going at it, right?

23:31.033 --> 23:34.016
And I begin to do the, you know,
the butterfly thing.

23:34.051 --> 23:37.000
And just like probie says,
she goes absolutely nuts.

23:37.035 --> 23:38.199
She's lovin' it.

23:38.234 --> 23:40.134
Then, out of the blue,
she starts hitting me

23:40.169 --> 23:41.499
and yelling at me,

23:41.534 --> 23:43.100
- calling me names.
- What was the problem?

23:43.135 --> 23:44.632
Well, apparently,
she didn't like it

23:44.667 --> 23:46.534
when I stuck the other finger
in her ass.

23:48.534 --> 23:49.801
What is that, funny?

23:49.836 --> 23:50.932
Yeah.

23:50.967 --> 23:52.667
It's two fingers
in the front, Einstein.

23:52.702 --> 23:53.817
Really?

23:53.852 --> 23:54.898
Hey.

23:54.933 --> 23:55.932
Hey!

23:55.967 --> 23:58.466
- How's it going, fellas?
- Hey, doc.

23:58.501 --> 24:00.833
Hey, I gotta tell you,
you're a very lucky man.

24:00.868 --> 24:03.501
The price you're getting
on this deck is ridiculous.

24:03.536 --> 24:06.332
Uh, listen, I just, um--

24:06.367 --> 24:08.733
You think we're gonna be done
by the end of the day?

24:08.768 --> 24:11.200
Because we're having a barbecue
in a couple of days and--

24:11.235 --> 24:13.234
I'm sure that won't be
a problem. Hey, probie...

24:13.269 --> 24:14.332
Yeah?

24:14.367 --> 24:16.167
You done by
the end of the day?

24:16.202 --> 24:17.833
I don't know, Tommy.

24:17.868 --> 24:20.967
Doc, he'll be done.
Don't worry about it.

24:21.002 --> 24:23.000
That would be fantastic.
Thanks.

24:23.035 --> 24:26.701
Well, uh, tallyho.

24:31.134 --> 24:32.250
Did he just say, "Tallyho"?

24:32.285 --> 24:33.367
Yeah, he said,
"Tallyho."

24:33.402 --> 24:34.234
Yes, he did.

24:35.768 --> 24:37.165
Hey.

24:37.200 --> 24:39.050
Everything okay?

24:39.085 --> 24:40.865
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

24:40.900 --> 24:43.900
Hey, um, remember those pills
I showed you the other morning?

24:43.935 --> 24:45.865
Yeah.

24:45.900 --> 24:47.499
I haven't taken any yet.

24:47.534 --> 24:49.367
Well, it's probably a good idea.

24:49.402 --> 24:51.165
If your head's
a little messed up,

24:51.200 --> 24:53.167
no need messing up
your metabolism as well.

24:53.202 --> 24:54.033
Right.

24:57.334 --> 24:58.833
Hey, doc,

24:58.868 --> 25:01.434
can I ask your professional
opinion about something?

25:03.734 --> 25:05.567
Sure, go ahead. Yeah.

25:05.602 --> 25:07.332
All right.

25:07.367 --> 25:08.466
You know, my wife--

25:08.501 --> 25:10.750
My soon-to-be-ex-wife,
probably.

25:10.785 --> 25:13.000
I think we're getting divorced.

25:13.035 --> 25:15.000
I'm sorry to hear that.

25:15.035 --> 25:16.268
Thanks.

25:16.303 --> 25:17.466
Anyways,

25:17.501 --> 25:21.100
the other night I was looking
out the window of my house,

25:21.135 --> 25:23.766
and I caught her

25:23.801 --> 25:26.067
across the street in her window,
staring right back at me.

25:26.102 --> 25:28.933
You're sure
she was staring at you?

25:28.968 --> 25:30.833
Yeah, without a doubt.

25:30.868 --> 25:32.667
I mean, it was--
As soon as she realized

25:32.702 --> 25:34.067
I was staring
straight back at her,

25:34.102 --> 25:35.267
she ducked out of the way.

25:35.302 --> 25:36.801
Right.

25:36.836 --> 25:38.265
So...

25:38.300 --> 25:39.601
what do you think that means?

25:41.267 --> 25:42.766
What do you think it means?

25:42.801 --> 25:46.232
The vibe I got, anyways,
was that she, you know,

25:46.267 --> 25:48.884
it seemed like she was sort of
lost in thought, you know?

25:48.919 --> 25:51.501
Like maybe she was thinking
about coming over or something?

25:51.536 --> 25:52.965
I don't know.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.067
I think she was probably
thinking about me.

25:57.167 --> 25:58.766
Right. Well, could be.

25:58.801 --> 26:03.933
Yeah, I agree with you.
I think she was.

26:03.968 --> 26:04.898
All right, thanks.

26:04.933 --> 26:06.766
Well, thank you, Tommy.

26:06.801 --> 26:09.667
- You're the best.
- All right, thanks.

26:15.100 --> 26:17.000
You know who's a great actor?

26:17.035 --> 26:18.101
Keanu Reeves.

26:18.136 --> 26:19.132
Oh, I think so.

26:19.167 --> 26:20.967
- Did you ever see Dracula?
- No.

26:21.002 --> 26:22.332
Who am I?

26:22.367 --> 26:26.100
I say, is the castle far?

26:28.667 --> 26:30.632
Hey, another thing, doc.

26:30.667 --> 26:33.000
She's got this boyfriend--
Ex-boyfriend, Roger.

26:33.035 --> 26:34.667
I'm sorry, who?

26:34.702 --> 26:36.332
My wife.

26:36.367 --> 26:37.932
She was--
She came over the other day

26:37.967 --> 26:41.334
to tell me that this guy Roger
is basically out of the picture.

26:41.369 --> 26:45.167
So... she was kind of vulnerable,
and I...

26:45.202 --> 26:46.601
I don't know.
I screwed up.

26:46.636 --> 26:47.566
I pissed her off,

26:47.601 --> 26:49.432
and I kind of,
you know,

26:49.467 --> 26:51.300
lost an opportunity there,
I think.

26:51.335 --> 26:52.932
But here's what I'm thinking.

26:52.967 --> 26:55.033
If I go over
and I give a soft sell,

26:55.068 --> 26:57.100
maybe bring some flowers
or something,

26:57.135 --> 26:58.499
and I kind of
apologize to her,

26:58.534 --> 27:01.900
I think I can get her back
to the point where she was.

27:01.935 --> 27:05.134
And I think then I might have
a real shot at her.

27:05.169 --> 27:07.268
What do you think?

27:07.303 --> 27:09.332
Uh, what do you think?

27:09.367 --> 27:12.834
I think
if I play my cards right,

27:12.869 --> 27:14.699
I'm good to go.

27:14.734 --> 27:17.801
I think what you think
is really important here.

27:21.067 --> 27:22.634
Did you get some coverage
for tomorrow?

27:22.669 --> 27:23.735
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm good.

27:23.770 --> 27:24.766
What do you got planned?

27:24.801 --> 27:27.434
Uh, I don't know. Thinking
about going fishing.

27:27.469 --> 27:29.165
- I like that idea.
- I like it.

27:29.200 --> 27:31.599
You know, she was always
riding my ass.

27:31.634 --> 27:33.834
I come home, and I'm not
emotionally available,

27:33.869 --> 27:36.232
and I can't open up,
and blah, blah, blah.

27:36.267 --> 27:39.667
You know, meanwhile--
Boy, you're gonna love this.

27:39.702 --> 27:40.833
--she's got this
sort of, like,

27:40.868 --> 27:43.100
gaggle of chicks,
and they ride my ass as well.

27:43.135 --> 27:44.399
I can tell,

27:44.434 --> 27:46.634
'cause when I walk in a room,
her kitchen or something,

27:46.669 --> 27:48.368
and I surprise 'em,
everybody shuts up.

27:48.403 --> 27:50.151
So I know they're
talking about me. Right.

27:50.186 --> 27:51.900
And meanwhile, this one chick,
Mary Ellen--

27:51.935 --> 27:52.865
You'll love this--

27:52.900 --> 27:54.265
Tommy, I'm really sorry,

27:54.300 --> 27:56.601
but I actually have to finish up
some work here.

27:56.636 --> 27:58.085
No problem, doc.
Go ahead.

27:58.120 --> 27:59.499
So this chick Mary Ellen,

27:59.534 --> 28:01.701
she's been married and divorced
three times, okay?

28:01.736 --> 28:03.199
Three times!

28:03.234 --> 28:05.401
And she's gonna
give my wife advice

28:05.436 --> 28:06.599
on what an asshole I am?

28:06.634 --> 28:07.833
I don't think so.

28:07.868 --> 28:09.634
It's like a big episode
of the Oprah show.

28:13.734 --> 28:14.867
Where are you going?

28:14.902 --> 28:15.965
Inside to take a leak.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Or I could go in your beer
if you prefer.

28:18.035 --> 28:19.534
Oh, no.
Once was enough, thanks.

28:19.569 --> 28:21.032
What's up?

28:21.067 --> 28:22.401
Ask them.
It's fascinating.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.666
Ah-ah-ah-ah.

28:26.701 --> 28:28.834
Not until you've built
some steps, pal.

28:28.869 --> 28:30.634
Let's go.
Back up on the deck.

28:30.669 --> 28:31.567
Move!

28:33.933 --> 28:37.199
My wife,
she's a good person.

28:37.234 --> 28:39.367
She's got kind of a narrow
view of the world,

28:39.402 --> 28:41.065
if you know what I mean.

28:41.100 --> 28:42.900
She's made her bed,
she's lying in it,

28:42.935 --> 28:44.599
she's perfectly happy.

28:44.634 --> 28:49.267
Anything new comes along,
anything breaks the status quo,

28:49.302 --> 28:50.466
it's a major crisis.

28:50.501 --> 28:54.099
You don't mind, do you?

28:54.134 --> 28:57.967
Grandmother dead,
grandfather dead,

28:58.002 --> 28:59.898
mother dead,
father dead...

28:59.933 --> 29:02.283
So, you know, my parents,
especially my dad,

29:02.318 --> 29:04.634
they say I have
a problem with commitment,

29:04.669 --> 29:06.200
whatever that's supposed
to mean.

29:06.235 --> 29:07.432
I mean, who doesn't, right?

29:07.467 --> 29:09.450
You know, the way
I look at it,

29:09.485 --> 29:11.434
I'm young,
I'm good-looking,

29:11.469 --> 29:12.666
I got a sexy job.

29:12.701 --> 29:15.167
I should try to get
all the pussy I can.

29:15.202 --> 29:16.634
I can say "pussy," right?

29:16.669 --> 29:18.499
Well, you could,

29:18.534 --> 29:21.834
but, I guess, you know,
I'd rather you didn't.

29:21.869 --> 29:24.501
That's what
I'm feeling right now.

29:24.536 --> 29:25.501
Who wants well done?

29:25.536 --> 29:26.599
I do, please.

29:26.634 --> 29:28.768
I want no sand.
How about that?

29:28.803 --> 29:30.485
Yeah, work on it.

29:30.520 --> 29:32.167
Might be sawdust.

29:32.202 --> 29:33.601
Could be.

29:33.636 --> 29:34.965
Could be.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.167
I gotta go to the bathroom.

29:38.200 --> 29:41.334
Hey, you're a shrink, right?

29:41.369 --> 29:42.932
Yes.

29:42.967 --> 29:44.267
That's cool.

29:49.033 --> 29:50.768
So, what's the deal
with that Shinsky guy?

29:50.803 --> 29:52.032
He seemed
really pissed off.

29:52.067 --> 29:54.467
What do you think the deal is?
He wants his porch done.

29:54.502 --> 29:56.033
Tomorrow you work
double fast, got it?

29:56.068 --> 29:57.065
- Yeah. Got it.
- Tommy.

29:57.100 --> 29:59.099
Tommy, you goddamn asshole!

29:59.134 --> 30:00.967
You've got a park
named after Vito, huh?

30:01.002 --> 30:02.801
You help him, but
you don't help me, Tommy?

30:02.836 --> 30:04.299
Huh? Nice move!

30:04.334 --> 30:05.998
What about my kids,
huh?

30:06.033 --> 30:07.734
What about my wife, Tommy? Huh?

30:11.734 --> 30:13.734
Hey, you okay, Tommy?

30:13.769 --> 30:14.766
What?

30:14.801 --> 30:16.834
- You okay?
- Yeah.

30:42.534 --> 30:43.567
They're gone.

30:43.602 --> 30:45.432
Who?

30:45.467 --> 30:46.666
Vito and Bobby.

30:46.701 --> 30:47.898
Just like that, man.

30:47.923 --> 30:49.563
I've been looking everywhere.

30:50.072 --> 30:50.959
Really?

30:52.401 --> 30:54.367
Well, I guess it was their time.

30:54.402 --> 30:55.998
But everybody's vanishing.

30:56.033 --> 30:58.734
It's making me a little nervous.

30:58.769 --> 31:00.232
Like, maybe I'm next?

31:00.267 --> 31:02.734
No, you're gonna be okay.
Don't worry about it.

31:03.734 --> 31:05.666
You got company.

31:05.701 --> 31:06.701
I ain't goin' anywhere.

31:06.736 --> 31:07.768
Honey, I'm home.

31:07.803 --> 31:08.752
Hi.

31:08.787 --> 31:09.701
Hi.

31:11.601 --> 31:13.065
What's going on?

31:13.100 --> 31:15.934
Katie and Connor went
to the Walkers' for a sleepover,

31:15.969 --> 31:18.768
and Colleen went to the movies
with her friends, so...

31:18.803 --> 31:20.332
you know, the house
was kind of quiet,

31:20.367 --> 31:22.601
so I thought I'd come over
and see what's going on.

31:22.636 --> 31:23.768
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

31:23.803 --> 31:25.299
Mm-hmm.

31:25.334 --> 31:27.601
You been drinking?

31:27.636 --> 31:28.601
Just a touch.

31:29.667 --> 31:31.801
That's a lot with you.

31:31.836 --> 31:35.466
So...

31:35.501 --> 31:36.734
I like that shirt.

31:38.134 --> 31:40.284
Really?

31:40.319 --> 31:42.076
Mm-hmm.

31:42.111 --> 31:43.834
Hmm.

31:46.467 --> 31:49.466
Mm. This is--

31:49.501 --> 31:51.567
Mm. Very interesting.

31:51.602 --> 31:53.484
And what are we doing?

31:53.519 --> 31:55.367
We're gonna go upstairs.

31:55.402 --> 31:57.334
- We are?
- Mm-hmm.

31:57.369 --> 31:58.366
Okay.

31:58.401 --> 32:00.617
Now, not that I don't
wanna go upstairs,

32:00.652 --> 32:02.834
but, um, now, where are
we going with this?

32:02.869 --> 32:03.968
What, you don't want me?

32:04.003 --> 32:05.067
No, that's not
what I said.

32:05.102 --> 32:07.099
I did not say that.

32:07.134 --> 32:10.134
Tommy, we were always
at our best

32:10.169 --> 32:11.466
when we were in bed.

32:11.501 --> 32:13.033
A million problems
everywhere else,

32:13.068 --> 32:16.367
- but in bed...
- Mm-hmm.

32:16.402 --> 32:17.951
all great.

32:17.986 --> 32:19.466
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

32:19.501 --> 32:20.567
- Come on.
- All right.

32:23.267 --> 32:24.583
Hey, whoa.

32:24.618 --> 32:26.193
You okay?

32:26.228 --> 32:27.733
Yes. Ouch.

32:27.768 --> 32:29.065
Honey, you know what?

32:29.100 --> 32:31.583
I think you're a little drunk.

32:31.618 --> 32:34.032
This may not be the best idea.

32:34.067 --> 32:38.601
Don't tell me.
This is the perfect idea.

32:38.636 --> 32:40.666
All right,
you know what?

32:40.701 --> 32:43.134
I'm gonna run out to the truck.

32:43.169 --> 32:44.099
- All right?
- Mm-hmm.

32:44.134 --> 32:45.501
I'll be back in two seconds.

32:47.567 --> 32:49.933
Don't make me start without you.

32:49.968 --> 32:51.834
I won't.

32:51.869 --> 32:53.701
Okay.

32:55.534 --> 32:57.334
Careful.

33:00.300 --> 33:01.467
Oh, my God.

33:05.334 --> 33:06.466
Hey, doc.

33:06.501 --> 33:08.267
What are you doing?

33:08.302 --> 33:09.998
I need some advice.

33:10.033 --> 33:11.632
My wife and I were in bed,
Tommy.

33:11.667 --> 33:13.667
Sorry, I didn't know
you go to sleep so early.

33:13.702 --> 33:15.032
Yeah, we weren't sleeping.

33:15.067 --> 33:17.267
That ties right into what
I wanted to ask you about.

33:17.302 --> 33:18.865
My wife--

33:18.900 --> 33:21.067
I think I told you about her,
my ex-wife?

33:21.102 --> 33:22.265
She's at my house right now,

33:22.316 --> 33:24.154
and she wants me to have sex
with her.

33:24.185 --> 33:25.959
Great. Go ahead.
Somebody should be doing it.

33:26.002 --> 33:27.218
No, but here's
the thing.

33:27.253 --> 33:28.399
Okay, it's complicated.

33:28.434 --> 33:30.932
She's also drunk off her ass,
so I just feel conflicted,

33:30.967 --> 33:33.467
like I might be taking advantage
of the situation, you know--

33:33.502 --> 33:35.068
Well, Tommy,
I'm not your shrink.

33:35.103 --> 33:36.599
I can't give you
professional advice.

33:36.634 --> 33:38.199
You'd have to call me,
make an appointment.

33:38.234 --> 33:40.667
You have to become a client,
you have to pay me, understand?

33:40.702 --> 33:43.334
Yeah, but...
I'm doing your deck.

33:43.369 --> 33:45.932
I'm not
a professional carpenter.

33:45.967 --> 33:49.033
Forgive me,
that doesn't make any sense.

33:49.068 --> 33:50.599
All right.

33:50.634 --> 33:52.267
Just tell me what I should do.

33:54.234 --> 33:55.434
What do you want to do?

33:55.469 --> 33:56.865
I wanna bang her.

33:56.900 --> 33:59.634
I haven't had sex with her
in a year and a half.

33:59.669 --> 34:01.501
Then I guess you know
what you want to do.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.032
You're a good man.

34:06.067 --> 34:06.933
Thanks. I appreciate it.

34:31.801 --> 34:33.264
Hey.

34:33.300 --> 34:35.701
Hey, Geneva. I hope you don't
mind me coming by like this.

34:35.735 --> 34:36.766
No, it's okay.

34:36.801 --> 34:38.199
Like I told you
on the phone,

34:38.235 --> 34:39.331
I talked to Andrew,

34:39.367 --> 34:41.000
and I'm real sorry
about what happened.

34:41.034 --> 34:42.299
I just sort of freaked out.

34:42.333 --> 34:44.134
I'm kind of, like, shy
sometimes.

34:44.168 --> 34:46.299
It's okay.

34:46.333 --> 34:47.701
It's better shy than a jerk.

34:48.768 --> 34:50.300
Do you want to come in?

34:52.234 --> 34:54.232
Is Andrew here?

34:54.266 --> 34:57.768
No, he has an early basketball
game in Queens tomorrow,

34:57.803 --> 34:59.434
so he's at a friend's house.

35:03.734 --> 35:04.601
Come in.

35:22.033 --> 35:23.050
Take this.

35:23.085 --> 35:24.076
What is it?

35:24.111 --> 35:25.032
Viagra.

35:25.067 --> 35:27.599
Oh, no.
I don't need Viagra.

35:27.634 --> 35:30.167
Well, how many times
can you go without it?

35:30.282 --> 35:32.613
'Cause if the number's less than five,
you'll need it.

35:34.701 --> 35:37.567
Can I get a glass
of water?

35:37.602 --> 35:38.833
- Yes.
- Please.

36:00.200 --> 36:03.183
Wow.
It really is like bowling.

36:19.269 --> 36:20.100
Whoa!

36:27.000 --> 36:28.167
Ow.

36:28.202 --> 36:29.299
Hey.

36:29.334 --> 36:31.267
I'm not really into
anything too kinky.

36:31.302 --> 36:33.601
Well, that's too bad.

36:35.401 --> 36:37.801
It looks like you're ready
to go again, mister.

36:37.836 --> 36:38.932
Don't let me stop you.

36:38.967 --> 36:41.366
Hey, guys, really,
I meant what I said.

36:41.401 --> 36:43.434
I'm not really into the whole
three-way thing.

36:43.469 --> 36:44.865
Oh, really?

36:44.900 --> 36:46.701
By the looks of things,
you could've fooled me.

36:46.736 --> 36:49.366
No, that's the Viagra!

36:49.401 --> 36:51.199
Hey, why are we even talking?

36:51.234 --> 36:53.267
We should be doing
some other things.

36:53.302 --> 36:54.768
Hi, sweetie.

36:54.803 --> 36:55.933
Hey.

36:56.933 --> 36:58.499
Mikey, relax.

36:58.534 --> 37:00.666
She's so sweet,
isn't she?

37:00.701 --> 37:03.067
How can you resist her,
Mikey? I couldn't.

37:03.102 --> 37:05.051
No, guys.

37:05.086 --> 37:06.965
Geneva, help!

37:20.933 --> 37:22.334
I feel it's gonna be
really long.

37:22.369 --> 37:23.366
Howdy, pardner.

37:23.401 --> 37:25.834
Shut up.
I feel like an asshole.

37:25.869 --> 37:27.032
Yeah, you look
like one.

37:27.067 --> 37:29.067
Since when do they make you
dress up for this?

37:29.102 --> 37:30.267
I thought it was usually guys

37:30.302 --> 37:31.366
in their turnout gear.

37:31.401 --> 37:32.998
They decided to try
something new this year.

37:33.033 --> 37:35.367
It's retarded. Have you ever
heard of a cowboy in December?

37:35.402 --> 37:36.566
It doesn't even
make sense.

37:36.601 --> 37:38.001
I won't get any chicks
out of this.

37:38.036 --> 37:39.401
You're gonna get
lots of chicks.

37:39.436 --> 37:40.532
Women, they dig cowboys.

37:40.567 --> 37:42.401
You got the whole Marlboro Man
thing going on,

37:42.436 --> 37:43.868
except without the cancer.

37:43.903 --> 37:45.265
Okay, cowpoke.

37:45.300 --> 37:47.550
We're ready for you.
All set?

37:47.585 --> 37:49.801
I, uh...
I think this is gay.

37:49.836 --> 37:51.251
Honey, I'd know.

37:51.286 --> 37:53.027
You look fine.

37:53.062 --> 37:54.768
Come on over here.

37:54.803 --> 37:56.065
All right,

37:56.100 --> 37:58.033
let's see that position
we talked about earlier.

37:58.068 --> 38:00.932
Okay, good.

38:00.967 --> 38:03.534
Turn the upper body
slightly towards me.

38:03.569 --> 38:05.267
Chin up. Chin up.

38:05.302 --> 38:06.332
Nice. Nice.

38:06.367 --> 38:08.567
How do we feel about the hay?

38:08.602 --> 38:10.667
Well, I think it sucks.

38:10.702 --> 38:12.101
Lose it.

38:12.136 --> 38:13.466
Thank you.

38:13.501 --> 38:15.267
Hey, can I lose the bandana,
too?

38:15.302 --> 38:16.632
Why?

38:16.667 --> 38:18.667
Without a shirt on,
I think it looks strange.

38:18.702 --> 38:20.401
The whole point
of this

38:20.436 --> 38:22.065
is for me to get some sex,

38:22.100 --> 38:25.134
and I'm not gonna get any if I'm
wearing a stupid yellow bandana.

38:25.169 --> 38:26.367
Take her off.

38:26.402 --> 38:27.234
Oh.

38:29.300 --> 38:30.299
Thank you.

38:30.334 --> 38:31.734
Please, can we
get this over with?

38:31.769 --> 38:33.401
You're the boss. Okay.

38:33.436 --> 38:34.885
All right.

38:34.920 --> 38:36.299
Okay, chin up,

38:36.334 --> 38:37.450
and don't forget
the smile.

38:37.485 --> 38:38.609
Do not forget
the smile.

38:38.644 --> 38:39.699
Smiling, sexy cowboy.

38:39.734 --> 38:40.834
Hot, sexy,
smiling cowboy.

38:40.869 --> 38:41.984
Good. Good!

38:42.019 --> 38:43.065
Ride the pony.

38:43.100 --> 38:44.401
Come on, ride
the pony. Good!

38:49.868 --> 38:51.466
Hey, buddy.
How you doin'?

38:51.501 --> 38:53.601
Bet you're wondering
why I'm here, right?

38:53.636 --> 38:54.733
Yeah.

38:54.768 --> 38:56.768
Well, I just wanted to make sure
that, you know,

38:56.803 --> 38:57.868
there was no problem.

38:57.903 --> 38:58.900
No bad feelings.

38:58.935 --> 38:59.900
Well--

39:02.000 --> 39:04.567
When I said that you could
have sex with my girl,

39:04.602 --> 39:05.734
I meant with me there,

39:05.769 --> 39:07.332
ass-wipe!

39:07.367 --> 39:09.267
Thanks for saving my life.

39:18.933 --> 39:20.433
Yeah.

39:20.468 --> 39:21.898
Hello.

39:21.933 --> 39:23.150
You talk to your mother?

39:23.185 --> 39:24.332
Don't have time, Dad.

39:24.366 --> 39:26.147
Just heading over
to see my lovely wife.

39:26.192 --> 39:26.583
What?

39:26.635 --> 39:28.289
Looks like we're getting
back together.

39:28.314 --> 39:29.336
How'd you pull that off?

39:29.366 --> 39:31.231
She came over last night,
we talked things over,

39:31.269 --> 39:33.334
and I think it was just,
you know, meant to be.

39:33.369 --> 39:34.985
Was she drunk?

39:35.020 --> 39:36.566
I gotta go.

39:36.601 --> 39:40.434
Will you call your mother,
please?

39:40.469 --> 39:42.200
You call her.

39:43.200 --> 39:46.000
Hey!

39:47.267 --> 39:48.834
Ow!

39:48.869 --> 39:50.366
Damn!

39:50.401 --> 39:51.499
You all right?

39:51.534 --> 39:53.499
You know,
this is hard work.

39:53.534 --> 39:55.734
You know, if you'd stepped up
a little bit more yesterday,

39:55.769 --> 39:57.267
we wouldn't be
in this situation.

39:57.302 --> 39:58.300
Give me some more screws.

39:59.701 --> 40:00.733
Whoa, whoa.

40:00.768 --> 40:02.401
What the hell happened
to your wrist?

40:02.436 --> 40:03.399
What?

40:03.434 --> 40:04.599
You hit it
with a hammer?

40:04.634 --> 40:05.967
- Franco, look at this.
- What's up?

40:06.002 --> 40:08.366
It's nothing.

40:08.401 --> 40:10.599
Yeah, that's nothing.

40:10.634 --> 40:12.868
Somebody cuffed you up
last night, didn't they?

40:12.903 --> 40:13.833
How'd you know?

40:13.868 --> 40:15.067
Kid, look who you're talking to.

40:15.102 --> 40:16.399
I look a little bit closer,

40:16.434 --> 40:18.033
I could tell you the make
and manufacturer.

40:18.068 --> 40:19.701
You were handcuffed last night?

40:19.736 --> 40:21.334
As much as I hate
to stop working,

40:21.369 --> 40:23.399
I'm intrigued.

40:23.434 --> 40:26.601
Remember the guy I saved?
The guy with the hot girlfriend?

40:26.636 --> 40:28.601
The couple that wanted to have
a three-way with you?

40:28.636 --> 40:30.099
They got it last night.

40:30.134 --> 40:32.667
Yeah, but I thought
you blew 'em off.

40:32.702 --> 40:34.265
They tricked me.

40:34.300 --> 40:36.100
I thought I was just
gonna get the girl,

40:36.135 --> 40:38.067
and then he came in.

40:38.102 --> 40:39.965
They raped me, Lou.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.733
And they got the whole
thing on video.

40:42.768 --> 40:45.167
Wait a minute, now.
Wait a minute.

40:45.202 --> 40:47.117
When he--
When the guy showed up,

40:47.152 --> 40:48.809
didn't you, like,
go to half-mast?

40:48.844 --> 40:50.432
I wish.
She slipped me some Viagra.

40:50.467 --> 40:52.667
I feel like I just lost my wood
10 minutes ago.

40:52.702 --> 40:55.466
See, that explains it.

40:55.501 --> 40:57.499
I saw you coming to work today,

40:57.534 --> 40:59.868
I thought you just really,
really liked construction.

41:01.734 --> 41:04.632
I feel violated.

41:04.667 --> 41:05.667
Look, hey,
you know what?

41:05.702 --> 41:08.332
It's behind you now.

41:08.367 --> 41:09.998
Speaking of behind you now,

41:10.033 --> 41:11.634
this guy get any action off you,
probie?

41:11.669 --> 41:13.167
- No.
- Yeah, he did.

41:13.202 --> 41:14.132
He did.

41:14.167 --> 41:15.701
Hey, looking
good, guys.

41:16.868 --> 41:18.499
- Thanks.
- Hello!

41:18.534 --> 41:20.134
Hey. What the hell happened?

41:20.169 --> 41:21.132
What?

41:21.167 --> 41:22.567
You get back together
with your wife,

41:22.602 --> 41:23.918
you don't call
your own brother?

41:23.971 --> 41:25.559
- Who told you?
- Dad. What happened?

41:25.595 --> 41:26.726
Got her into bed last night,

41:26.737 --> 41:28.535
turned the whole thing around.
What can I say?

41:28.570 --> 41:29.367
You lucky prick.

41:29.401 --> 41:31.200
I can't even get my wife
to blow me.

41:31.235 --> 41:33.499
Buh-bye.

41:33.534 --> 41:34.699
Hey, Tommy,
is that for real?

41:34.734 --> 41:36.317
You and Janet
getting back together?

41:36.352 --> 41:38.043
- Yep. Looks that way.
- Hey, that's great.

41:38.078 --> 41:39.734
And here comes
the blushing bride now.

41:39.769 --> 41:40.699
- Hey, Janet.
- Hey.

41:40.734 --> 41:42.234
- How are you?
- What's going on?

41:42.269 --> 41:43.466
Hey. Good.

41:43.501 --> 41:46.033
- Hey, can I talk to you?
- Sure.

41:46.068 --> 41:46.900
Okay, not here.

41:51.300 --> 41:52.300
How you doing?

41:52.335 --> 41:53.265
I'm all right.

41:53.300 --> 41:55.399
Hey, last night
was crazy.

41:55.434 --> 41:57.267
Yeah. Tommy,
nothing's changed.

41:57.302 --> 41:59.232
What?

41:59.267 --> 42:01.650
Last night probably
shouldn't have happened.

42:01.685 --> 42:04.033
In fact, it definitely
shouldn't have happened.

42:04.068 --> 42:04.998
I'm sorry.

42:05.033 --> 42:06.199
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

42:06.234 --> 42:07.734
- Don't get mad.
- I'm not getting mad.

42:07.769 --> 42:08.751
Yes, you are.

42:08.786 --> 42:09.699
No, I'm not.

42:09.734 --> 42:11.399
Okay? And let's think back.

42:11.434 --> 42:13.634
I didn't come looking for you
last night, you came over--

42:13.664 --> 42:15.739
Now you're gonna tell me
it shouldn't have happened?

42:15.799 --> 42:17.528
I was drunk. I was frustrated.

42:17.586 --> 42:19.210
I'm tired
of being alone.

42:19.245 --> 42:20.799
You're not alone, okay?

42:20.834 --> 42:21.898
I'm right across the street,

42:21.933 --> 42:24.200
which you gladly took
advantage of last night.

42:24.235 --> 42:25.667
You don't understand.

42:25.702 --> 42:27.065
I need
something more,

42:27.100 --> 42:28.900
something that I can't get
from you.

42:28.935 --> 42:31.532
Yes, the sex was great,

42:31.567 --> 42:33.634
but the sex is always
great with us, Tommy.

42:33.669 --> 42:34.699
We've never
had a problem

42:34.734 --> 42:35.984
connecting
on a physical level,

42:36.019 --> 42:37.199
but on an emotional
level...

42:37.234 --> 42:39.234
Jesus Christ. I knew
that's what you were gonna say!

42:39.269 --> 42:41.265
I can't do this anymore.

42:41.300 --> 42:42.933
I'm tired of being this lonely.

42:42.968 --> 42:44.117
You know what?

42:44.152 --> 42:45.232
You're nuts.

42:45.267 --> 42:46.501
You should see
a shrink, because--

42:46.536 --> 42:47.965
I am sorry.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.032
You're sorry.
Bullshit.

42:49.067 --> 42:50.467
You come over
to my house, okay.

42:50.502 --> 42:51.566
You lure me into bed,

42:51.601 --> 42:53.200
you bang me,
you get my hopes up,

42:53.235 --> 42:54.466
and now you're sorry?

42:54.501 --> 42:56.701
- I wanted to see if it still worked.
- What, my dick?

42:56.736 --> 42:59.232
Okay, that's it.

42:59.267 --> 43:00.932
All right.
Thanks for coming by.

43:00.967 --> 43:03.900
Oh, and by the way, the sex,
it wasn't that great.

43:03.935 --> 43:06.967
Kiss my ass.

43:07.002 --> 43:07.932
Tommy!

43:07.967 --> 43:09.167
- Tommy, come on!
- Tommy, no!

43:11.267 --> 43:13.467
Pick that up,
take it over to my house.

43:13.497 --> 43:15.287
Tommy, we've been
working all day.

43:15.320 --> 43:16.738
$2,000, man.

43:16.801 --> 43:18.632
What--?
What are you doing?

43:18.667 --> 43:21.067
Real nice advice telling me to
go have sex with my wife.

43:21.102 --> 43:22.067
Worked real well, asshole.

43:22.102 --> 43:24.132
What?

43:24.167 --> 43:25.634
You need psychological help,
Gavin.

43:25.669 --> 43:27.432
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, you do!

43:27.467 --> 43:29.701
And if you want it from me,
make an appointment,

43:29.738 --> 43:31.797
come to my office,
and pay for it!

43:31.818 --> 43:33.399
Yeah, well, if your house
catches fire,

43:33.423 --> 43:35.291
don't call me, asshole.
Call the fire department.

43:35.323 --> 43:36.527
- Tommy, no!
- Tommy!

43:36.558 --> 43:37.484
It's two grand.

43:37.503 --> 43:38.751
Tommy, two grand.

43:38.786 --> 43:40.000
Jesus, Tommy.

43:43.801 --> 43:46.067
Pick that up and take it over
to my house. Let's go!
