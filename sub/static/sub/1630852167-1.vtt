Sophie.
Over here.

00:29.834 --> 00:31.417
- What?
- Hi.

00:31.500 --> 00:32.626
- Hi.

00:32.709 --> 00:34.083
- [laughs]
- Hi.

00:34.167 --> 00:37.667
- Sophie's favorite is
definitely "Twist and Shout."

00:38.626 --> 00:39.959
- Every horrible day
in history

00:40.042 --> 00:42.083

before it.

00:45.876 --> 00:47.626
- This was ours.

00:47.709 --> 00:49.751
Halloween, 2006.

00:49.834 --> 00:51.959
- Go on, Soph.
- It's okay.

01:02.375 --> 01:06.542
- I went to bed that night
the luckiest guy alive.

01:06.626 --> 01:07.709
By the next night,
I was living

01:07.792 --> 01:10.417
the worst nightmare
imaginable.

01:10.500 --> 01:12.042
- Police in Manhattan tonight
are investigating

01:12.125 --> 01:14.542
the mysterious death
of a 40-year-old actress.

01:14.626 --> 01:16.250
Adrienne Shelly
was found dead

01:16.334 --> 01:18.584
in her West Village office
last night.

01:18.667 --> 01:21.334
It was Shelly's husband,
Andy Ostroy, who found her.

01:21.417 --> 01:23.375
- The actress,
found hanging in a bathroom

01:23.459 --> 01:26.709
of her Manhattan office,
likely committed suicide.

01:27.584 --> 01:32.000
Shelly leaves behind
a three-year-old daughter.

01:32.083 --> 01:34.334
- Oh, my God.
Look at you.

01:34.417 --> 01:37.167
You look drunk.
Did you drink?

01:37.250 --> 01:39.500
- There was no way
Adrienne killed herself.

01:39.584 --> 01:41.918
- [gasps]
Daddy!

01:43.083 --> 01:45.834
- Suicide simply
wasn't possible.

01:45.918 --> 01:48.459
She was the happiest
I'd ever seen her.

01:48.542 --> 01:50.709
[Sara Bareilles'

01:50.792 --> 01:52.125
I set out on a journey
to find out

01:52.209 --> 01:54.125
what really happened that day

01:54.209 --> 01:57.125
and to make sure Adrienne
would never be forgotten,

01:57.209 --> 01:58.918
especially for Sophie.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.918
-  Sometimes
I still see her

02:04.000 --> 02:09.250
My mother, the dreamer

02:09.334 --> 02:14.042
She'd say,

03:12.000 --> 03:14.626
- So this whole area,
when you come here,

03:14.709 --> 03:17.375
it just feels
like "Waitress" headquarters.

03:17.459 --> 03:19.751
I love the success of it
and what it means for her

03:19.834 --> 03:21.918
and her legacy.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.876
But then I'm just
immediately transported to,

03:24.959 --> 03:26.209
she's not here to see it,

03:26.292 --> 03:29.292
she's not here
to experience it.

03:29.375 --> 03:31.167
I'm making a documentary
about Adrienne Shelly.

03:31.250 --> 03:33.083
Do you know who she is?

03:33.167 --> 03:35.459
- Uh, I can see her name
right there.

03:35.542 --> 03:39.292
Uh, it's based upon the mo--
yes, that's all I know.

03:39.375 --> 03:40.667
- If I did that,
do you know who she is?

03:40.751 --> 03:42.292
- No, I don't.
- Do you know who she is?

03:42.375 --> 03:43.417
- I do not.

03:43.500 --> 03:45.959
- No?
- Um...no.

03:46.042 --> 03:47.959
- Many people who come
to see the show don't--

03:48.042 --> 03:49.626
just don't know
who Adrienne is.

03:49.709 --> 03:53.417
How she created this story
that has this life,

03:53.500 --> 03:56.876
this amazing life on Broadway,
12 years later,

03:56.959 --> 03:58.250
and they don't know who she is.

03:58.334 --> 04:01.959
That to me is--is--
is profoundly sad.

04:03.167 --> 04:05.626
- I wrote "Waitress"
when I was

04:05.709 --> 04:07.500
about eight months pregnant
with Sophie.

04:07.584 --> 04:09.167
And I was really scared
about having a baby.

04:09.250 --> 04:11.334
I just couldn't imagine
what my life was gonna be

04:11.417 --> 04:13.375
after I had a baby;
I thought it was gonna change

04:13.459 --> 04:14.876
so drastically
that I wasn't even

04:14.959 --> 04:16.292
gonna recognize myself
anymore.

04:16.375 --> 04:17.626
I was terrified.

04:17.709 --> 04:20.918
The actual fear of how your
life is going to change

04:21.000 --> 04:23.167
is not spoken about,

04:23.250 --> 04:26.167
so I--I wanted to write
a movie about those fears

04:26.250 --> 04:28.500
and, you know,
give those fears a voice.

04:28.584 --> 04:30.375
- I seem to be pregnant.
- Good.

04:30.459 --> 04:31.959
Good for you.
Congratulations.

04:32.042 --> 04:33.584
- Thanks,
but I'm not so happy about it

04:33.667 --> 04:35.167
like everybody else might be.

04:35.250 --> 04:37.292
I'm having the baby,
and that's that.

04:37.959 --> 04:39.542
- But I also knew that,
you know,

04:39.626 --> 04:41.500
when you actually
have the child

04:41.584 --> 04:44.626
that this other kind of love
probably kicks in

04:44.709 --> 04:47.584
that you can't even imagine,
which is true.

04:47.667 --> 04:51.667
It's a complete, utter,
unconditional kind of love,

04:51.751 --> 04:55.209
and it does change your life
in a--in a beautiful way.

04:55.292 --> 04:58.209
And it's--it is a love letter
to my--to my baby.

04:58.292 --> 05:00.792
[soft music]

05:00.876 --> 05:03.500
- The first page or two
was the opening sequence,

05:03.584 --> 05:05.751
making the pies
and bread sequence.

05:05.834 --> 05:08.042
And I was like,
"Yeah, you got me."

05:08.125 --> 05:10.042
I loved it.

05:10.125 --> 05:13.083
- "Earl murders me 'cause I'm
havin' an affair" pie.

Vanilla custard with banana.

05:25.042 --> 05:26.542
Hold the banana.

05:26.626 --> 05:30.125
- I loved her sense of humor,
her sensibility.

05:30.209 --> 05:34.542
For me to root
for this adulterous affair

05:34.626 --> 05:38.083
throughout this entire script
is such a feat.

05:38.167 --> 05:39.584
- I'm married.
You're married.

05:39.667 --> 05:41.375
I'm pregnant.
You're my doctor.

05:41.459 --> 05:42.709
- Maybe we could have a coffee
or something--

05:42.792 --> 05:44.083
- I can't have coffee.

05:44.167 --> 05:45.500
It's on the bad food list
you gave me.

05:45.584 --> 05:47.083
What kind of doctor are you?

05:47.167 --> 05:50.167
- That balance is so tricky,
because...

05:50.250 --> 05:51.375
- Sure.
- You shouldn't--

05:51.459 --> 05:52.751
you shouldn't kind of--
you shouldn't want...

05:52.834 --> 05:54.042
- Banging your gynecologist.
- These people to be

05:54.125 --> 05:55.083
doing this--right
I mean, it's like,

05:55.167 --> 05:56.250
there's nothing good
about this,

05:56.334 --> 05:57.709
except it works.

05:57.792 --> 05:59.375
- Mark it.
- Mark.

05:59.459 --> 06:00.918
- I loved the script
immediately.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.083
I mean,
it's so fun and irreverent

06:04.167 --> 06:06.209
and true all at once.

06:06.292 --> 06:08.083
- Dawn, you're beautiful.

06:08.167 --> 06:11.042
Your skin looks
like a normal person's.

06:11.125 --> 06:12.626
- Thank you.

06:12.709 --> 06:14.000
- I thought she was
really smart.

06:14.083 --> 06:16.000
I thought she was
really pretty.

06:16.083 --> 06:18.792
She was super ambitious,
I felt,

06:18.876 --> 06:20.959
super clear
about what she wanted.

06:21.042 --> 06:22.959
- She strikes me as a woman
who was ahead of her time

06:23.042 --> 06:25.959
in terms of the kind of art
she wanted to do

06:26.042 --> 06:28.959
and the kind of subject matter
she wanted to cover.

06:30.375 --> 06:31.792
- She's a real feminist icon
to me.

06:31.876 --> 06:34.542
I really think of her that way,
as being a real maverick.

06:34.626 --> 06:37.375
- I remember her
in her wedding gown

06:37.459 --> 06:39.250
and, like, being in the scene

06:39.334 --> 06:40.751
and then going
behind the monitors

06:40.834 --> 06:42.125
and then going back out
in the scene,

06:42.209 --> 06:43.918
holding up her skirt
when she ran.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.083
I mean, I think
it's challenging anyway

06:46.167 --> 06:48.417
to be in something
that you're directing.

06:48.500 --> 06:54.250
But also being a new mom
is pretty crazy.

06:54.334 --> 06:56.751
- You know, Adrienne
was this small person

06:56.834 --> 06:58.000
walking around the set

06:58.083 --> 07:00.459
but quietly powerful,

07:00.542 --> 07:01.876
because she knew exactly
what she wanted,

07:01.959 --> 07:04.459
this was her project,
and you listened.

07:04.542 --> 07:06.083
- I'm fine, Cal.
We'll be right out!

07:06.167 --> 07:09.292
- I wasn't surprised
when I saw "Waitress"

07:09.375 --> 07:10.334
for the first time.

07:10.417 --> 07:11.834
It just confirmed

07:11.918 --> 07:14.167
what I already knew to be true,

07:14.250 --> 07:17.876
and that was,
she was a great director.

07:17.959 --> 07:20.626
- I would've liked to have
seen where that career went.

07:20.709 --> 07:26.250
I would've liked to have heard
and seen more stories from...

07:26.334 --> 07:28.042
her vision.

know it, clap your hands

07:42.167 --> 07:45.209
If you're happy and you
know it, clap your hands

07:45.292 --> 07:48.042
- In hindsight,
November 1st started out

07:48.125 --> 07:50.584
in--
in a really fortunate way.

07:50.667 --> 07:52.709
I got to spend a lot of time
with her that morning

07:52.792 --> 07:55.125
in a way that I normally
wouldn't have.

07:58.125 --> 08:00.626
And I was really happy
that day.

08:02.417 --> 08:05.000
So we were together,
uh, in the apartment

08:05.083 --> 08:08.167
till about, um--

08:08.250 --> 08:09.959
till about 9:15.

08:10.042 --> 08:12.959
[somber music]

08:19.417 --> 08:22.125
And I was gonna drop her
at her office

08:22.209 --> 08:25.167
on Abingdon Square.

08:25.250 --> 08:27.459
I remember watching her
get out of the car

08:27.542 --> 08:30.083
and go into the building,

08:30.167 --> 08:33.959
and I just watched her
walk away into the building,

08:34.042 --> 08:35.792
you know, and that was
the last time I ever saw her,

08:35.876 --> 08:37.542
you know.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.083
I went to my office.
I was working all day.

08:42.167 --> 08:44.667
I had clients in
from out of town.

08:44.751 --> 08:47.042
All day long,
it was just radio silence.

08:47.125 --> 08:49.709
I couldn't get ahold of her
through email,

08:49.792 --> 08:52.209
cell phone, landline.

08:52.292 --> 08:54.375
The nanny hadn't heard
from her.

08:54.459 --> 08:56.876
Nobody was in contact with her,

08:56.959 --> 09:00.042
and that was
incredibly atypical.

09:01.292 --> 09:02.792
There's an intuition

09:02.876 --> 09:06.959
that something really awful
has happened.

09:07.042 --> 09:11.000
A friend of mine and I were
going to do an event together,

09:11.083 --> 09:12.792
and I said to him, you know,
"We got to go downtown

09:12.876 --> 09:14.626
"and check on Adrienne,
because I haven't heard

09:14.709 --> 09:15.959
"from her all day, and I--
I just--

09:16.042 --> 09:17.918
there's something
that's just not right."

09:18.000 --> 09:20.417
- You were definitely...

09:20.500 --> 09:22.125
wound a little tight
on the way over--

09:22.209 --> 09:23.959
on the drive over
from the office.

09:24.042 --> 09:26.751
And I was trying
to calm you down,

09:26.834 --> 09:27.876
you know, trying to think
of different scenarios

09:27.959 --> 09:30.209
or reasons why you wouldn't
have heard from her.

09:30.292 --> 09:33.250
And then we pulled in front
of the bus stop,

09:33.334 --> 09:35.083
and I said,
"Just leave the car running.

09:35.167 --> 09:36.417
I'll wait here."

09:36.500 --> 09:39.459
[tense music]

09:41.709 --> 09:44.667
- She wasn't
answering the intercom.

09:44.751 --> 09:47.626
Went up to the fourth floor,
banged on the door,

09:47.709 --> 09:49.834
calling her name--nothing.

09:49.918 --> 09:53.000
And I try the door,
and it just popped open.

09:53.083 --> 09:55.709
And that's
when the real panic set in.

09:55.792 --> 09:57.417
It was just palpable.

09:57.500 --> 10:01.125
It was just weird
how the room was just still,

10:01.209 --> 10:04.209
and CNN was on,
and Wolf Blitzer was talking.

10:04.292 --> 10:07.667
But it was low,
and you could just tell.

10:07.751 --> 10:10.000
It was like there was evil
in that room.

10:10.083 --> 10:12.083
Really, like,
that's what I felt.

10:12.167 --> 10:15.792
I felt that there had been
a monster in that place.

10:17.209 --> 10:21.083
- And my phone rings,
and you said,

10:21.167 --> 10:24.083
"Brian, get up here.
Adrienne's dead."

10:24.167 --> 10:27.125
- I just remember thinking
in that moment, like,

10:27.209 --> 10:29.834
"Is--
is this really happening?

10:29.918 --> 10:31.459
This is not
how it's supposed to"--

10:31.542 --> 10:32.876
like,
I was supposed to go there

10:32.959 --> 10:34.709
and find her,
like, talking outside,

10:34.792 --> 10:37.751
and, "Oh, Andy, I'm so sorry,"
like--

10:37.834 --> 10:40.709
like, I wasn't supposed
to find her dead.

10:46.375 --> 10:50.250
- Someone had said, "Andy is,
um, at the police station.

10:50.334 --> 10:52.500
They think
that she had killed herself."

10:52.584 --> 10:55.042
I just remember in my--
in my mind, thinking...

10:56.751 --> 10:58.375
"Sophie.
There's Sophie.

10:58.459 --> 11:00.167
She would never! Never."

11:00.250 --> 11:01.667
And I remember thinking,
"My mom!

11:01.751 --> 11:03.667
She would never
leave my mother."

11:03.751 --> 11:05.542
- This was the time
of her life!

11:05.626 --> 11:06.667
This was it!

11:06.751 --> 11:10.542
This is what she waited
her whole life to have.

11:10.626 --> 11:12.292
And she's gonna kill herself?

11:13.500 --> 11:16.542
- Friday,
I saw the "New York Post"

11:16.626 --> 11:18.751
and the story
they had written.

11:18.834 --> 11:21.042
So I called up Sixth Precinct,

11:21.125 --> 11:23.209
and I asked to speak
to the detective,

11:23.292 --> 11:25.000
and they told me he had gone
for the weekend.

11:25.083 --> 11:26.250
I said, "That's fine,
just give me someone else

11:26.334 --> 11:27.417
who's working the case."

11:27.500 --> 11:29.959
"There's nobody else
working the case."

11:31.000 --> 11:32.542
And he said, "Sorry, pal,

11:32.626 --> 11:34.375
"I know this is not
what you want to hear,

11:34.459 --> 11:37.042
but as far as we're concerned,
it's a suicide."

11:37.125 --> 11:38.667
It's almost like the grief

11:38.751 --> 11:40.375
and everything
that I had been feeling

11:40.459 --> 11:42.042
just sort of, like, pshoo,

11:42.125 --> 11:44.250
just--
just moved away.

11:44.334 --> 11:45.876
And this other thing took over.

11:45.959 --> 11:49.042
this, like, combat mode
of like,

11:49.125 --> 11:51.000
she's not here to fight
for herself.

11:51.083 --> 11:52.292
I've gotta fight for her.

11:53.125 --> 11:55.667
My wife did not kill herself.

11:55.751 --> 11:58.334
- Andy Ostroy says his wife's
death on Wednesday

11:58.417 --> 12:01.626
is suspicious and not
a simple case of suicide,

12:01.709 --> 12:03.209
despite media headlines
that proclaim

12:03.292 --> 12:06.292
that Adrienne Shelly,
the beautiful blonde actress,

12:06.375 --> 12:08.918
took her own life
inside apartment 47

12:09.000 --> 12:10.876
here in this Greenwich Village
apartment building.

12:10.959 --> 12:13.751
- There are emails,
phone conversations

12:13.834 --> 12:16.375
that took place almost up
until the time of the--

12:16.459 --> 12:17.626
of the tragedy itself.

12:17.709 --> 12:19.500
She was making plans with
our friends for the weekend,

12:19.584 --> 12:21.918
dropping off things
to our daughter's school.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.250
That little girl has
to grow up knowing the truth.

12:27.209 --> 12:29.709
Everything changed
the next morning.

12:29.792 --> 12:32.334
I get a call
from Detective Jimmy Piccione

12:32.417 --> 12:34.042
of Manhattan South Homicide.

12:34.125 --> 12:36.250
"Can you come in
and talk with us?"

12:36.334 --> 12:39.292
He showed me photos
of her apartment,

12:39.375 --> 12:43.209
of her desk, of her purse,
her computer.

12:43.292 --> 12:46.209
And then he showed me
a picture of the knot.

12:46.292 --> 12:49.792
And he asked me if she knew how
to make a--a knot like that.

12:49.876 --> 12:52.751
And I told him, uh, no--

12:52.834 --> 12:54.626
and I got angry in that moment,
'cause I had--

12:54.709 --> 12:56.125
and I said to him--
I flipped it back and said,

12:56.209 --> 12:58.500
"Do you know
how to make a knot like this?"

12:58.584 --> 12:59.792
And he said, "No."

12:59.876 --> 13:02.125
That day, I also called
Dr. Michael Baden,

13:02.209 --> 13:05.334
who's a world-renowned
forensic pathologist,

13:05.417 --> 13:07.542
so he was scheduled
to do an autopsy

13:07.626 --> 13:08.792
the next day, Saturday.

13:08.876 --> 13:13.334
I remember getting the call
from Baden that Saturday

13:13.417 --> 13:16.542
and hearing him say,
"She fought like an animal."

13:16.626 --> 13:19.250
- She had bruises on her body,
bruises on her face,

13:19.334 --> 13:23.042
forehead,
mostly left side of the face,

13:23.125 --> 13:27.167
and, um, inju--
injuries to her hands,

13:27.250 --> 13:30.250
uh, which would
indicate a struggle.

13:30.334 --> 13:32.834
We don't see that in suicides.

13:32.918 --> 13:35.375
- Everything I wanted
so desperately

13:35.459 --> 13:37.209
was being given to me
in that moment.

13:37.292 --> 13:40.083
Like, she didn't kill herself.
Like, here it is.

13:40.167 --> 13:42.459
Here's this--
here's some proof.

13:42.542 --> 13:44.334
And then just immediately,

13:44.417 --> 13:47.834
I'm starting to envision
what did happen.

13:54.626 --> 13:57.626
There she is.
- Where?

13:57.709 --> 14:00.918
Oh.
- Love that quote.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.417
- "Don't be afraid of dying.
Be afraid of never living."

14:04.500 --> 14:05.584
- True dat.

14:05.667 --> 14:08.083
You're almost the same age
as her here.

14:14.125 --> 14:17.918
Oh, Lennon,
your mother loved John Lennon.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.792
What are you feeling as you're
going through this stuff?

14:20.876 --> 14:23.209
- It's interesting.

14:23.292 --> 14:27.042
Just, like, learning more
about, like, who she was.

14:27.125 --> 14:28.876
- Look at that.
What does that say?

14:28.959 --> 14:31.083
Soph.
- What is it?

14:31.167 --> 14:32.542
- "I hate camp.
Take me home."

14:32.626 --> 14:33.500
- Oh--
oh.

14:33.584 --> 14:34.500
- Boy, that sounds familiar,
huh?

14:34.584 --> 14:35.709
- Did she hate camp?

14:35.792 --> 14:37.334
[gasps]
What?

14:37.417 --> 14:40.375
- "Allison is my new,
nice friend.

14:40.459 --> 14:41.792
She hates it here too."

14:41.876 --> 14:43.626
That's literally--
oh, my God.

14:43.709 --> 14:45.125
- I've literally gotten
that letter from you.

14:45.209 --> 14:47.167
- Gotta take that home, Andy.

14:47.876 --> 14:50.125
- Oh, that's a beautiful face,
Mrs. Levine.

14:50.209 --> 14:52.626
Do you have any tips
on how other families could

14:52.709 --> 14:56.459
reach the level of intelligence
that yours has?

14:56.542 --> 14:58.292
- [laughs]
- Is that all you have to say?

14:58.375 --> 14:59.417
Okay.

14:59.500 --> 15:02.876
- The day she was born
was beautiful.

15:02.959 --> 15:06.334
She was so beautiful,
that chubby little face,

15:06.417 --> 15:08.751
those cheeks,
that little mouth.

15:08.834 --> 15:11.834
Beautiful eyes--
she was beautiful.

15:11.918 --> 15:15.751
And she looked exactly
like Shelly, my first husband.

15:15.834 --> 15:18.292
The exact same face,
so of course,

15:18.375 --> 15:19.542
my husband was thrilled.

15:19.626 --> 15:20.667
You know what?

15:20.751 --> 15:22.792
She really knew
what she wanted.

15:22.876 --> 15:24.042
From when she was
five years old,

15:24.125 --> 15:26.125
when she was in kindergarten,
"Guys and Dolls,"

15:26.209 --> 15:27.334
that was the play.

15:27.417 --> 15:28.792
It was so cute.

15:28.876 --> 15:30.125
Every year, they had plays,

15:30.209 --> 15:32.167
and she was always
in everything.

15:32.250 --> 15:34.959
She always, always stood out.

15:35.042 --> 15:37.542
It was always Adrienne, like--
whew!

15:37.626 --> 15:39.959
- My crib was actually in--
in Adrienne's room.

15:40.042 --> 15:41.959
I was actually
one of her dolls.

15:42.042 --> 15:43.334
That's how she treated me.

15:43.417 --> 15:45.375
Adrienne used to like
to dress me up.

15:45.459 --> 15:47.834
My father was still alive
at the point,

15:47.918 --> 15:48.959
and I remember he was like,

15:49.042 --> 15:50.959
"What are you dressing him
in that--in that crap?"

15:51.042 --> 15:53.125
Adrienne just said,
"I don't know, it looks cute."

15:57.042 --> 16:01.709
- Adrienne had a lot of fear
about dying young.

16:01.792 --> 16:02.792
Shelly, whose name she took

16:02.876 --> 16:06.334
when she started working
professionally, um,

16:06.417 --> 16:08.417
when she was 12 years old
and away at sleepaway camp,

16:08.500 --> 16:11.876
he died
of a massive heart attack.

16:14.292 --> 16:17.375
Which left her with feelings
of her own mortality, uh,

16:17.459 --> 16:19.918
of, you know,
"Am I gonna die young?

16:20.000 --> 16:21.918
"If I die young
and I have a child,

16:22.000 --> 16:23.292
what--
what does that do?"

16:25.375 --> 16:29.167
When she was 12, that was
the summer when Shelly died.

16:29.250 --> 16:31.250
- Yes.
It was a horrible time.

16:31.334 --> 16:33.500
And I remember sitting
on the bed with them

16:33.584 --> 16:36.000
and holding the three of them,
and I said,

16:36.083 --> 16:38.459
"We're gonna get through it.
I promise you--

16:38.542 --> 16:41.292
I promise you
we will get through it."

16:41.375 --> 16:42.709
- This is an odd thing
you and I have in common,

16:42.792 --> 16:43.751
I just realized.

16:43.834 --> 16:45.083
- What was that?
What do we--

16:45.167 --> 16:46.918
- Telling little kids that...
- Oh!

16:47.000 --> 16:47.918
- Mommy or Daddy's not
coming home anymore.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.417
- Hello.
Right.

16:49.500 --> 16:50.918
She went into a funk.
- Uh-huh.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.667
- She really did.
She became very quiet.

16:54.500 --> 16:57.584
- "I wonder just how much
of life is spent in mourning.

16:57.667 --> 17:00.542
"It seems I mourn daily
over something or other.

17:00.626 --> 17:02.918
"Even when I am not mourning
over a person,

17:03.000 --> 17:05.417
"I am mourning
over my own inadequacies--

17:05.500 --> 17:07.709
"my feeble height,
my heavy thighs,

17:07.792 --> 17:10.500
my incessant fears, my habits."

17:10.584 --> 17:12.250
- I didn't know her
when her father died.

17:12.334 --> 17:13.459
- Mm-hmm.
- I remember

17:13.542 --> 17:16.042
we were in my house, and I
don't remember exactly how

17:16.125 --> 17:17.542
she started talking about him.

17:17.626 --> 17:19.751
She never talked
about him, really.

17:19.834 --> 17:22.000
And she started crying.
And I hugged her.

17:22.083 --> 17:24.459
And it was kind of just
a moment where I just

17:24.542 --> 17:26.500
held her and hugged her
while she cried.

17:26.584 --> 17:28.125
And then she revealed to me
after that

17:28.209 --> 17:30.459
that was the first time
she cried to anybody...

17:30.542 --> 17:32.834
- Mm.
- About him.

17:32.918 --> 17:35.292
And, um, well,
we were already 16.

17:39.083 --> 17:40.584
- Were there ever times
when you just come in

17:40.667 --> 17:42.584
and you close the door
and you cry?

17:43.417 --> 17:45.167
- No.

17:45.250 --> 17:46.584
I haven't cried in a while.

17:46.667 --> 17:49.250
Like, I don't cry about it.
- Mm-hmm.

17:49.334 --> 17:51.125
- I don't really
show my emotions.

17:51.209 --> 17:52.292
- Mm-hmm.

17:52.375 --> 17:55.209
Do you ever worry that
that's not healthy for you?

17:55.292 --> 17:58.083
- Yeah.
It's not.

17:58.167 --> 17:59.918
- How do you think
it's not healthy?

18:00.000 --> 18:01.834
- 'Cause you need
to let it out.

18:01.918 --> 18:04.709
I haven't had, like, a--
like, a cry...

18:04.792 --> 18:06.792
- Mm-hmm.

18:06.876 --> 18:08.167
- In, like, years.
- Mm-hmm.

18:08.250 --> 18:10.375
- I don't even remember.

18:10.459 --> 18:12.209
- Whee!

18:12.292 --> 18:14.626
Whee!
- Whoo!

18:14.709 --> 18:16.167
- Wanna sing the alphabet song
with me?

18:16.250 --> 18:17.334
- Yes.
- Okay.

18:17.417 --> 18:22.042
both:  A, B, C, D, E, F, G

18:22.125 --> 18:24.876
- I'd gone to a psychiatrist
to...

18:24.959 --> 18:26.500
find out how--
what do I say

18:26.584 --> 18:30.083
to a kid who's not even three?

18:30.834 --> 18:33.751
They can't really handle much,
so it's just very specific,

18:33.834 --> 18:36.584
you know, "Mommy died.

18:36.667 --> 18:38.584
"Her body stopped working.

18:38.667 --> 18:40.834
She's not coming home anymore."

18:41.709 --> 18:43.459
That's it.

18:43.542 --> 18:45.459
And so that's what I told her.

18:45.542 --> 18:48.417
And then I remember
she walked over to the window,

18:48.500 --> 18:52.375
and she just stared out the
window, and I was beside her.

18:52.459 --> 18:53.834
She just...

18:55.417 --> 18:59.709
Turned to me and said,
"Mommy died.

18:59.792 --> 19:02.125
She's not coming back."

19:02.209 --> 19:06.500
Then I said, "Nope,
she's not coming back."

19:06.584 --> 19:09.292
And she just stared
right out the window.

19:11.626 --> 19:13.459
And that was it.

19:21.584 --> 19:24.209
Over the years, Sophie
and I had what I thought

19:24.292 --> 19:27.042
were incredibly deep
conversations about Adrienne.

19:27.125 --> 19:29.792
I felt it was important
in those moments

19:29.876 --> 19:32.209
to capture them forever.

19:32.292 --> 19:35.834
So I copied them down
verbatim.

19:38.167 --> 19:39.417
- I really miss Mommy.

19:39.500 --> 19:40.584
- I know, sweetie.

19:40.667 --> 19:41.918
What made you think
of that just now?

19:42.000 --> 19:43.250
- I just miss being with her.

19:43.334 --> 19:45.375
It makes me cry.

19:45.459 --> 19:47.417
We used to do stuff together,
and I miss her.

19:47.500 --> 19:49.417
- I know.
I wish I could have saved her.

19:49.500 --> 19:51.667
It's so unfair.
- Especially to me,

19:51.751 --> 19:54.375
because everybody else has
a mommy, and I don't.

19:55.792 --> 19:58.042
I wonder what it's like
to have a mom.

19:58.125 --> 20:01.000
[soft music]

20:11.751 --> 20:13.834
- She was probably
one of the most

20:13.918 --> 20:15.500
loyal friends I've ever had.

20:15.584 --> 20:19.209
She was fiercely loyal
and supportive.

20:20.209 --> 20:22.125
- Did Adrienne perform here?
- No.

20:22.209 --> 20:23.626
I don't remember Adrienne here.
- Yes, she did.

20:23.709 --> 20:24.626
- She did?
- She did.

20:24.709 --> 20:25.626
- I thought it was
the other theater.

20:25.709 --> 20:26.751
- No.
She did--they did, um...

20:26.834 --> 20:28.167
- She did here?
- I'm gonna guess

20:28.250 --> 20:29.626
it was "Pippin."

20:40.375 --> 20:42.417
- You got it?
Let's see.

20:42.500 --> 20:44.250
Oh, right.

20:44.334 --> 20:47.459
- Did she call herself
Adrienne Shelly in 1984?

20:47.542 --> 20:49.959
- Anytime she could
use Shelly's name, she did.

20:50.042 --> 20:52.000
- Mm-hmm.

20:52.083 --> 20:54.167
- Andy, do me a favor.
- What?

20:54.250 --> 20:56.918
- Put your hand together
with me here.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.834
Okay.
It's for Sophie too.

20:59.918 --> 21:02.250
Love you, A.
Love you.

21:06.417 --> 21:10.292
[gentle piano music playing]

21:10.375 --> 21:11.959
- She was great on the piano.

21:12.042 --> 21:13.334
She could play anything
by ear.

21:13.417 --> 21:15.626
I don't remember her
taking piano lessons.

21:15.709 --> 21:17.959
She could just get on and play
and sing.

21:18.042 --> 21:19.125
It was quite amazing.

21:19.209 --> 21:20.834
-  And it's good to know

21:20.918 --> 21:26.500
My best friend
has come home again

21:26.584 --> 21:29.292
- We met through
our ninth grade chorus class.

21:29.375 --> 21:32.584
The teacher clearly
recognized Adrienne's voice

21:32.667 --> 21:34.709
and gave her a solo.

21:34.792 --> 21:38.209
And I remember hearing
this voice--

21:38.292 --> 21:42.042
like, she belted it,
and, uh, it was unreal.

21:42.125 --> 21:48.876
-  Come in from the rain

21:49.626 --> 21:52.876
- That was really the first
time where you could tell

21:52.959 --> 21:55.334
that this was something
she was really serious about.

21:58.083 --> 22:00.751
- Um, Adrienne Lauren Levine.

22:00.834 --> 22:03.751
- We kept in touch
all through college,

22:03.834 --> 22:06.876
even though we were, you know,
in separate locations,

22:06.959 --> 22:08.334
and I actually remember,
junior year,

22:08.417 --> 22:11.000
she called me to tell me
she was leaving college.

22:11.083 --> 22:13.876
She was running it by me
before she had told her mom.

22:13.959 --> 22:15.626
- Really?
- Yes.

22:15.709 --> 22:16.918
- What was your an--uh...
- She said--

22:17.000 --> 22:19.083
- Advice?
- She called me up, she says,

22:19.167 --> 22:20.751
"I think I wanna
drop out of college

22:20.834 --> 22:22.250
"and move to New York
and become an actress.

22:22.334 --> 22:24.209
What do you think?"

22:24.292 --> 22:26.250
So I said, "Oh--
well, if that's..."

22:26.334 --> 22:28.083
- Sounds logical.
- "What you want to do."

22:28.167 --> 22:30.918
She's like, "Well, I--
I'm nervous to tell my mom."

22:31.000 --> 22:33.751
- And I said, "Oh,
what are you talking about?

22:33.834 --> 22:35.792
You have one more year."

22:35.876 --> 22:37.876
"Ma, I wanna--
I know what I want.

22:37.959 --> 22:40.083
"It's--
it's such a calling for me.

22:40.167 --> 22:42.542
It's--it's--
it's my calling."

22:44.334 --> 22:46.209
- "Well, I'm doing it.

22:46.292 --> 22:48.083
"I'm leaving school.
It's all done.

22:48.167 --> 22:51.042
"All of a sudden,
I've taken a huge risk.

22:51.125 --> 22:53.375
"I face a new jungle now,
with strange faces,

22:53.459 --> 22:58.250
situations, rejections, and
joys I can't even imagine."

23:01.209 --> 23:04.834
"June 7, 1987.
Happy June.

23:04.918 --> 23:07.459
"Happy month of my 21st year.

23:07.542 --> 23:09.125
"New York has given me much

23:09.209 --> 23:11.292
"in the four months
I've lived here.

23:11.375 --> 23:14.459
"It has virtually ended
the long depression sessions,

23:14.542 --> 23:17.792
"which were once
a signature characteristic.

23:17.876 --> 23:19.751
"It has taught me a lot
about myself

23:19.834 --> 23:23.417
that I wouldn't have learned,
not for a while, without it."

23:23.500 --> 23:26.459
[soaring music]

23:30.542 --> 23:34.959
- She sent her headshot out
to hundreds of people.

23:35.042 --> 23:37.918
One showed up and my office,
and I liked it.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.417
- She got the part right away.

23:40.500 --> 23:43.083
And I said, "Oh, we did right.
We did right."

23:45.417 --> 23:46.500
- It happened quickly.

23:46.584 --> 23:50.292
Like, in no time,
she was now the star

23:50.375 --> 23:55.042
of this indie cult film.

23:55.125 --> 23:57.542
- Adrienne was
the first actress

23:57.626 --> 23:58.834
that I was asked to read with.

23:58.918 --> 24:00.626
Hal had already
given me the role.

24:00.709 --> 24:02.667
- Hi.
- Hello.

24:02.751 --> 24:04.626
- Can I help you find
something?

24:04.709 --> 24:06.626
- This I remember more
than anything.

24:06.709 --> 24:09.083
Her evaluating me.
She doesn't have the role.

24:09.167 --> 24:11.042
Do you work here?
- I happen to be a big fan

24:11.125 --> 24:12.792
of George Washington myself.

24:12.876 --> 24:14.709
- Really?
But she was just kind of

24:14.792 --> 24:16.792
giving me a--
you know, a once-over.

24:16.876 --> 24:18.792
- I can't help thinking
that if he were alive today,

24:18.876 --> 24:20.751
doing the job he did then,

24:20.834 --> 24:22.584
leading that particular
revolution,

24:22.667 --> 24:25.042
he'd be locked up
or worse.

24:25.125 --> 24:26.334
- Yeah,
she was a complete unicorn

24:26.417 --> 24:27.375
as far as I was concerned.

24:27.459 --> 24:28.584
She scared me a little.

24:28.667 --> 24:31.709
Um, she said certain things
to me that totally unnerved me.

24:31.792 --> 24:33.834
- All of them--
Franklin, Payne, Jefferson,

24:33.918 --> 24:35.209
they'd be executed.

24:35.292 --> 24:38.709
- Well, maybe not executed.
- Oh, don't put it past people.

24:38.792 --> 24:41.209
- Not in a bad way,
just made me think.

24:41.292 --> 24:43.375
[mellow guitar music]

24:43.459 --> 24:45.584
- I hardly remember
directing her at all,

24:45.667 --> 24:47.334
because once I cast her,

24:47.417 --> 24:49.667
I just didn't have to worry
about her at all.

24:49.751 --> 24:51.000
She always knew her lines.

24:51.083 --> 24:53.167
She was always funny
in the right way.

24:53.250 --> 24:54.792
She was consistent.

24:54.876 --> 24:56.709
She was perfect for that role.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.834
The Toronto Film Festival
selected it,

25:01.918 --> 25:03.459
and it was a big hit there,

25:03.542 --> 25:05.417
and that's where
everything started.

25:05.500 --> 25:07.918
Miramax bought the rights
to it.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.542
In that company
was Harvey Weinstein.

25:10.626 --> 25:12.250
It's always an argument.

25:12.334 --> 25:14.125
He wanted me to recut the film,

25:14.209 --> 25:19.209
particularly to add some degree
of nudity with Adrienne.

25:19.292 --> 25:23.083
And I was like, "No.
The film as it is, is fine."

25:23.167 --> 25:24.709
- Dad, give me $5.

25:24.792 --> 25:25.709
- Listen to me, young lady,

25:25.792 --> 25:27.375
I've had just about
all I'm gonna take.

25:27.459 --> 25:29.792
- Mom, what's he talkin' about?
Give me $5.

25:29.876 --> 25:32.375
Well, "The Unbelievable Truth"
was my first film.

25:32.459 --> 25:35.000
And--and "Trust"
was my second film.

25:36.834 --> 25:39.000
- Come back here a minute.

25:39.083 --> 25:42.876
- First one was so much easier
for me to make,

25:42.959 --> 25:45.209
because it was closer
to who I actually am.

25:46.584 --> 25:50.292
She's your typical pregnant
high school teenager...

25:50.375 --> 25:53.542
- Whose baby?
- Yours, you jerk!

25:53.626 --> 25:55.584
- Who accidentally
kills her father

25:55.667 --> 25:57.292
in the first scene
of the movie.

26:00.042 --> 26:01.459
- She seemed
to be the centerpiece

26:01.542 --> 26:03.125
to a lot of Hal's films.

26:03.209 --> 26:06.125
I was like, "God, if--maybe
she's his muse in a way."

26:06.209 --> 26:08.918
And there was something kind of
ethereal about Adrienne.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.918
I mean,
she looked like a doll.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.584
- It was just young people
learning the ropes

26:13.667 --> 26:15.209
of being
in the entertainment business

26:15.292 --> 26:16.918
and some of the uglier parts
of it.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.459
And also very good parts too.

26:21.167 --> 26:23.918
By the time we arrived
in Toronto

26:24.000 --> 26:27.334
for the opening night premiere
of "Trust,"

26:27.417 --> 26:28.876
she was kind of a star.

26:28.959 --> 26:31.626
[Blondie's "Dreaming"]

26:55.167 --> 26:59.292
-  When I met you
in a restaurant

26:59.375 --> 27:00.626
- When you're starting out
as an actor,

27:00.709 --> 27:03.626
the odds of something like
what happened to Adrienne...

27:03.709 --> 27:04.834
- Right, she was,
like, an overnight--

27:04.918 --> 27:06.167
- Happening so, so fast--
yes.

27:06.250 --> 27:10.167
And she was very conflicted
about it as well,

27:10.250 --> 27:12.417
because it is overwhelming.

27:12.500 --> 27:14.876
I mean, suddenly she's on the
cover of "Interview" magazine,

27:14.959 --> 27:18.709
and filmmakers are calling
her, and she just--

27:18.792 --> 27:21.209
I don't think she was prepared
for how big--

27:21.292 --> 27:24.334
I don't think anyone was--how
big that film was going to be.

27:25.167 --> 27:29.209
-  Dreaming, dreaming

27:29.292 --> 27:32.834
- After we premiered "Trust,"
she immediately went to LA

27:32.918 --> 27:34.042
to do a movie.

27:34.125 --> 27:37.792
She was getting
really good roles.

27:37.876 --> 27:40.834
- I really like it.
- What?

27:40.918 --> 27:43.209
- Your work.

27:43.292 --> 27:46.459
Reminds me
of a dream I once had.

27:47.918 --> 27:52.209
- Stephanie,
that's just a blank canvas.

27:54.292 --> 27:55.834
- Yeah.

27:57.792 --> 28:00.584
- There was one--
some sort of glamorous opening

28:00.667 --> 28:02.292
that she was invited to,
and she took us,

28:02.375 --> 28:03.834
and all of these people--
really, she was, like,

28:03.918 --> 28:05.918
their darling,
and she really didn't want

28:06.000 --> 28:07.334
that much to do with it.

28:09.959 --> 28:12.334
- Hi, everybody.
- She was a little dismissive

28:12.417 --> 28:14.959
of the movies she was making.

28:15.042 --> 28:16.334
They were a means to an end.

28:16.417 --> 28:18.375
- She did a lot
of really crappy movies...

28:18.459 --> 28:20.042
- Yeah, yeah.
- In the '90s.

28:20.125 --> 28:24.500
None of them really
showcased who she was.

28:24.584 --> 28:26.167
- Well, a lot of times,
they liked to showcase her

28:26.250 --> 28:27.209
as the sexpot.

28:27.292 --> 28:30.709
- Right.
- And as sexy as Adrienne was,

28:30.792 --> 28:32.584
that's not her persona.

28:33.083 --> 28:37.918
- I have a--you know, a certain
interest in self-respect

28:38.000 --> 28:42.959
that, uh, being an actor,
there's a lot of, um,

28:43.042 --> 28:47.250
people who would like
to squelch that.

28:47.334 --> 28:49.250
Like, I get a call in the car
from my agent,

28:49.334 --> 28:51.792
and he's like, "Okay, listen.

28:51.876 --> 28:54.125
"Here's the thing that--
that's really important

28:54.209 --> 28:56.918
to these people
is that you be fuckable."

28:57.000 --> 28:59.417
I get in the room, and there's
these two great women,

28:59.500 --> 29:01.292
and they're so nice,
and they're wonderful.

29:01.375 --> 29:03.584
And I'm like, "What, they don't
care if I'm fuckable.

29:03.667 --> 29:05.584
They don't care," you know,
and they're just friendly

29:05.667 --> 29:08.792
and, "Oh, we love your work,"
and I'm like, "Oh, thanks."

29:08.876 --> 29:11.042
And then this man walks in.

29:11.125 --> 29:13.167
And I swear to you,

29:13.250 --> 29:15.209
he looked like Mr. Potato Head.

29:15.292 --> 29:18.042
He walks in
and he looks right at my tits.

29:18.125 --> 29:20.834
Not even--not even at my face.
Just, like, right--and I'm--

29:20.918 --> 29:24.834
and I saw in his face
that there was no way

29:24.918 --> 29:28.000
that I was gonna get this part,
because he didn't like my tits.

29:29.083 --> 29:33.667
I think I spent a lot
of my 20s

29:33.751 --> 29:38.459
as if I were in some dark
adventure of some kind,

29:38.542 --> 29:41.542
not really feeling
myself alive.

29:41.626 --> 29:46.459
And I feel, like,
a real desire to...

29:46.542 --> 29:52.125
not...
live my life that way anymore.

29:52.209 --> 29:57.709
That I...
live more consciously.

29:57.792 --> 29:59.709
- I got a call out of the blue
that said, "Do you want to be

29:59.792 --> 30:01.542
in this theater company
that I'm starting?"

30:01.626 --> 30:04.083
It was an unusual choice
to suddenly deicide,

30:04.167 --> 30:06.375
"I want to do theater and I'm
gonna start a theater company,

30:06.459 --> 30:08.876
and I'm gonna pay for it
and produce it," and--

30:08.959 --> 30:12.209
and she did, and--
and, um, we did this series

30:12.292 --> 30:14.626
of one-acts that we all wrote.

a script, because--

31:10.292 --> 31:12.751
and she would open the door
just like this, 'cause,

31:12.834 --> 31:14.876
you know, maybe her place
wasn't the neatest.

31:14.959 --> 31:17.334
- You know
she was a little sloppy?

31:17.417 --> 31:20.042
[laughs]
- Is that a serious question?

31:20.125 --> 31:21.584
- We weren't allowed
in Adrienne's room.

31:21.667 --> 31:23.918
- Yeah--oh!
That's funny.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.459
That--that's very funny.
- Well, I wasn't allowed

31:25.542 --> 31:26.959
in Adrienne's apartment
when I met her.

31:27.042 --> 31:28.125
- Yeah.
- Literally.

31:28.209 --> 31:29.292
- Probably for the same reason.
- For the same reason.

31:29.375 --> 31:31.459
And the crazy thing is,
Sophie is exactly like her.

31:31.542 --> 31:33.751
- Oh, wow.
- Literally.

31:33.834 --> 31:36.250
- She had this scheme once

31:36.334 --> 31:40.167
where she was gonna sell stuff
on eBay

31:40.250 --> 31:43.417
that she, like,
got in thrift stores

31:43.500 --> 31:44.542
and Goodwill and stuff.

31:44.626 --> 31:46.876
So on top of all the mess,

31:46.959 --> 31:48.250
now you walked in there,

31:48.334 --> 31:51.209
and her entire dining room was,
like, lamps--

31:51.292 --> 31:54.709
- Now she's a businesswoman.
- Yeah, now she's a bus--

31:54.792 --> 31:57.250
No, "I'm gonna sell these.
I'm selling them on eBay."

31:57.334 --> 32:00.459
- A tornado of things every--
you don't even know

32:00.542 --> 32:03.000
how things would--would get--
hanging off the ceiling.

32:03.083 --> 32:04.792
It was just everywhere.

32:04.876 --> 32:06.626
And it was great.
It was great.

32:06.709 --> 32:08.918
I mean, a lot of creative
people are messy.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.167
- Yeah.
- She's, uh, not--

32:11.250 --> 32:12.626
you know, she's an alien.

32:12.709 --> 32:14.584
- Right.

32:14.667 --> 32:17.667
- She was like an old lady
in a hot chick's body.

32:17.751 --> 32:19.834
- That kind of personality

32:19.918 --> 32:23.167
that was sort of shut in
for four days

32:23.250 --> 32:25.626
and really focused

32:25.709 --> 32:27.959
is not necessarily
the same kind of person

32:28.042 --> 32:29.792
that's gonna be just schmoozing
and schmoozing

32:29.876 --> 32:32.125
and just trying
to always get a job.

32:32.209 --> 32:35.959
I think the visionary in her
was actually an introvert.

32:36.042 --> 32:39.250
And it allowed her
to really accomplish

32:39.334 --> 32:42.584
a lot in a very short period
of time.

32:44.125 --> 32:48.083
- So then she did a reading
of the first movie she made,

32:48.167 --> 32:50.542
not the shorts,
but "Sudden Manhattan."

32:50.626 --> 32:52.209
- Mm-hmm.
- And I mean,

32:52.292 --> 32:54.250
money wasn't coming through,
and I said something

32:54.334 --> 32:55.834
like, "Well, you know,
it's your first movie.

32:55.918 --> 32:57.083
"Like,
maybe this'll be a sample.

32:57.167 --> 32:58.083
"This is your first screenplay.

32:58.167 --> 32:59.584
Like, the next one'll
get made."

32:59.667 --> 33:00.876
And she just looked at me,
and she was like,

33:00.959 --> 33:03.000
"I don't have that kind
of time."

33:03.083 --> 33:06.000
[tense music]

33:17.918 --> 33:19.709
- I remember sitting with
my friends Liz and Nathan.

33:19.792 --> 33:22.125
They had come in
from Los Angeles.

33:22.209 --> 33:23.709
Liz was Adrienne's
best friend.

33:23.792 --> 33:26.792
Nathan was one
of my best friends.

33:26.876 --> 33:29.292
They had a baby two days
after we did.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.709
We were real close.

33:31.792 --> 33:33.250
- My phone rang,
my cell phone rang.

33:33.334 --> 33:36.042
And, uh, I glanced at it,
and it was you.

33:36.125 --> 33:37.375
And then you just went
right into--

33:37.459 --> 33:39.375
you said, "Listen, I've--
I've got terrible news,

33:39.459 --> 33:41.125
horrible news."

33:41.209 --> 33:43.417
Just like that,
"Terrible news, horrible news.

33:43.500 --> 33:47.834
Adrienne, she's--she--
she died, she--she's dead."

33:49.292 --> 33:51.834
- I just remember I fell
to the ground,

33:51.918 --> 33:54.709
and I started screaming.

33:54.792 --> 33:56.542
I mean, screaming to the point
that, like,

33:56.626 --> 33:59.542
some neighbors said that
they could hear me that night.

33:59.626 --> 34:01.250
- Wow.
- Down the street.

34:01.334 --> 34:04.083
- We came to New York, um,

34:04.167 --> 34:05.751
and I remember when we were
getting on the flight,

34:05.834 --> 34:07.459
I was on the phone with you
and you were--you know,

34:07.542 --> 34:09.667
you were in--you were
in attack mode, you were in--

34:09.751 --> 34:11.959
it was good to hear you--

34:12.042 --> 34:13.792
at least you had that
to focus on.

34:13.876 --> 34:15.584
It was time to go, it was,
like, 2:00 in the morning,

34:15.667 --> 34:16.834
and we opened the door
and we were heading out,

34:16.918 --> 34:19.626
and you stopped, you said,
"You know what my dream is?

34:19.709 --> 34:23.584
That they call me and say,
'We've made an arrest.'"

34:27.042 --> 34:30.542
- And at 6:00
or 6:30 the next morning,

34:30.626 --> 34:33.667
I got a call
from Detective Piccione.

34:33.751 --> 34:37.417
He said, "Andrew, can you come
downstairs in ten minutes?

34:37.500 --> 34:38.751
We need to talk with you."

34:38.834 --> 34:41.918
And then one unmarked car
pulled up.

34:43.292 --> 34:45.083
Uh,
Jimmy and his partner got out

34:45.167 --> 34:48.667
and said, "Andrew, we arrested
the guy who killed Adrienne."

34:51.417 --> 34:54.209
- Police now say the death
of actress Adrienne Shelly

34:54.292 --> 34:56.500
was murder, not suicide.

34:56.584 --> 34:58.542
Now a construction worker
is under arrest.

34:58.626 --> 35:01.000
- Diego Pillco
confessed to the crime.

35:01.083 --> 35:02.667
Pillco had been
renovating an apartment

35:02.751 --> 35:04.042
in the Greenwich Village
building

35:04.125 --> 35:06.500
where the 40-year-old actress
had her office.

35:06.584 --> 35:09.083
- Diego Pillco was arrested
after police allegedly

35:09.167 --> 35:11.626
matched his sneaker footprint
to one found

35:11.709 --> 35:13.792
in the bathtub where Shelly
was found hanging

35:13.876 --> 35:16.542
from a bedsheet tied
to the shower curtain rod.

35:16.626 --> 35:18.459
- My control
over my body just left,

35:18.542 --> 35:20.292
and I just dropped
to the floor,

35:20.375 --> 35:22.918
and I started crying.

35:24.042 --> 35:26.751
Because it was everything
I needed to hear.

35:30.751 --> 35:32.209
- Let's pretend Mommy's here.

35:32.292 --> 35:34.042
Hi, Mommy.

35:34.125 --> 35:35.542
- Mommy loved you very much.

35:35.626 --> 35:37.000
She didn't choose
to leave us.

35:37.083 --> 35:39.250
She had an accident,
and she died.

35:39.334 --> 35:40.876
- She peed in her pants?

35:40.959 --> 35:43.209
- No,
a different kind of accident.

35:43.292 --> 35:45.375
- Mommy coming back soon?
She's gonna get out

35:45.459 --> 35:47.334
of the elevator
and knock on the door?

35:47.417 --> 35:48.709
- No.
- Mommy come back

35:48.792 --> 35:50.167
when she's bigger and better?

35:50.250 --> 35:51.709
- No, Mommy wasn't sick.

35:51.792 --> 35:53.042
When you die,
you don't come back.

35:53.125 --> 35:54.667
- She threw up
and had a bellyache?

35:54.751 --> 35:56.459
- No.
- What can we do for her?

35:56.542 --> 35:58.500
Give her chicken?
Water?

35:58.584 --> 36:01.000
- No, there's nothing we can
do for her now, sweetie.

36:01.083 --> 36:03.667
She's not coming back.

36:03.751 --> 36:06.292
I often think about what
my life would've been like,

36:06.375 --> 36:07.375
how I would have handled it

36:07.459 --> 36:10.042
if I had a different
family situation.

36:11.667 --> 36:13.792
- I just kept thinking
over and over,

36:13.876 --> 36:15.792
"What is Sophie gonna do?"

36:15.876 --> 36:18.459
Like, that was just--"What's
gonna happen with Sophie?"

36:18.542 --> 36:21.959
It was just--
it was like a dagger.

36:22.042 --> 36:24.417
- I remember Sean,
the first thing he did

36:24.500 --> 36:26.417
was come down here to Sophie.

36:26.500 --> 36:29.959
And I've talked to him
about it, and he--

36:30.042 --> 36:32.876
he said wasn't even,
like, a thought.

36:32.959 --> 36:36.042
He just--he knew he had
to be with Sophie.

36:36.125 --> 36:40.500
- He was only...
13 at the time or 12.

36:40.584 --> 36:44.417
And he immediately says,
"I'm going to Sophie."

36:44.500 --> 36:47.042
And then, you know,
that was the last night

36:47.125 --> 36:48.709
he lived with me.

36:48.792 --> 36:50.375
- I think I knew when I--
when I left,

36:50.459 --> 36:54.792
I was gonna start living here,
which I ended up doing, but...

36:54.876 --> 36:59.292
I--I don't think I had any
other thought but just Sophie.

36:59.375 --> 37:01.792
Like,
"What's going on with her?

37:01.876 --> 37:04.209
"How's she gonna feel
when she, you know,

37:04.292 --> 37:07.292
realizes what happened?"
that kind of thing.

37:07.375 --> 37:08.751
- Go get a ball.

37:13.500 --> 37:16.083
- Hey, you!
- Hi, Andy.

37:16.167 --> 37:17.167
- Been a while.
- How are you?

37:17.250 --> 37:19.083
I know. Hi.
- Pretty good.

37:19.167 --> 37:20.584
Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you too.

37:20.667 --> 37:23.584
- Yeah.
I was just trying to explain

37:23.667 --> 37:27.459
before to someone that,
you know, to come back--

37:27.542 --> 37:30.417
to come to a place like this,
for me,

37:30.500 --> 37:32.584
you know, 'cause this is one
of the places

37:32.667 --> 37:34.626
that are a part of this crime,
right?

37:34.709 --> 37:37.167
- Right.
- And over the years,

37:37.250 --> 37:39.834
it becomes bigger and, like,
bigger and bigger and bigger,

37:39.918 --> 37:42.834
and it's a way for me
to just take control of it...

37:42.918 --> 37:44.375
- Yeah.
- And for me to own it

37:44.459 --> 37:46.167
and make it smaller
and smaller.

37:46.250 --> 37:48.334
- Sometimes when you visualize
things, it helps, you know.

37:48.417 --> 37:49.667
- Yeah, so it's not as mythical

37:49.751 --> 37:51.500
and big and, like,
larger than life.

37:51.584 --> 37:52.500
- Right.
- It's just--it's just

37:52.584 --> 37:53.500
a building in Brooklyn

37:53.584 --> 37:55.876
where a killer lived
in the basement.

37:56.709 --> 37:59.834
They had these footprints in--
in Adrienne's bathroom.

37:59.918 --> 38:01.959
They checked
everybody's shoes.

38:02.042 --> 38:03.584
Nothing matched.

38:03.667 --> 38:05.292
I believe it was the Saturday

38:05.375 --> 38:08.500
that Detective Piccione went
to the building.

38:08.584 --> 38:10.250
[tense music]

38:10.334 --> 38:15.042
He noticed a very thin layer
of construction dust

38:15.125 --> 38:17.500
up near Adrienne's door.

38:17.584 --> 38:20.083
He inquired if there was
construction in the building.

38:20.167 --> 38:22.042
"Yes, there is."
"Where?"

38:22.125 --> 38:25.292
"The apartment below."
"Oh, let's go take a look."

38:26.500 --> 38:30.167
Open the door, boom.
Footprint.

38:30.250 --> 38:34.042
Same footprint that's upstairs
in the bathroom.

38:35.334 --> 38:36.959
- I'll tell you,
if that footprint wasn't

38:37.042 --> 38:38.542
on that bathtub,
I don't think he would have

38:38.626 --> 38:40.292
ever gotten caught.

38:40.375 --> 38:42.000
That's where Jimmy comes
into play, Jimmy Piccione,

38:42.083 --> 38:43.375
because Jimmy kept saying,

38:43.459 --> 38:44.626
"You know,
I really believe him.

38:44.709 --> 38:45.626
I really believe the husband."

38:45.709 --> 38:46.667
He kept saying that.
"I--I believe it."

38:46.751 --> 38:48.292
He showed me the pictures,
and he goes,

38:48.375 --> 38:50.209
"Why would a mother
who has a two-year-old child

38:50.292 --> 38:52.751
and she's happy,
why would she commit suicide?"

38:54.334 --> 38:55.584
When we first interviewed him,
we'd talk

38:55.667 --> 38:57.751
pedigree information, like,
you know, what's his name,

38:57.834 --> 38:59.125
you know, where he came from,

38:59.209 --> 39:01.375
how long he's been in America,
how did he get here?

39:01.459 --> 39:03.375
At some point, I noticed
that he kept looking--

39:03.459 --> 39:05.083
playing with a prayer card,
like, he kept using

39:05.167 --> 39:07.292
this prayer card, and you could
tell that he was praying.

39:07.375 --> 39:09.751
And I said to him,
"Do you have any children?"

39:09.834 --> 39:11.417
He says
he didn't have any children.

39:11.500 --> 39:13.375
I said, "Do you have
any nieces or nephews?"

39:13.459 --> 39:14.584
He says,
"As a matter of fact, I have--

39:14.667 --> 39:15.792
"my sister has a couple
of kids.

39:15.876 --> 39:17.417
I have, like,
four nieces and nephews."

39:17.500 --> 39:18.751
I believe it was four.

39:18.834 --> 39:22.042
And I sa--made him go through
the list of how old they were.

39:22.125 --> 39:24.209
So he went through the whole
list of all the children.

39:24.292 --> 39:26.042
The last child
that he discussed,

39:26.125 --> 39:28.375
her name was Tiffany,
and she was two years old.

39:28.459 --> 39:30.000
And I said to him,
I go, "You know the lady--

39:30.083 --> 39:31.918
"the lady that died upstairs,
you know,

39:32.000 --> 39:33.167
she had
a two-year-old daughter."

39:33.250 --> 39:34.209
So then I said,
"You know something?

39:34.292 --> 39:35.209
"In life sometimes when,
you know,

39:35.292 --> 39:37.000
"you do something wrong,
God doesn't punish you.

39:37.083 --> 39:39.125
He punishes someone
in your family."

39:39.209 --> 39:41.334
And at that point,
he puts his head down

39:41.417 --> 39:43.250
and he comes back up,
he goes, "Okay, I did it."

39:43.334 --> 39:45.792
- Mm.

39:45.876 --> 39:47.792
- So after I got
the confession,

39:47.876 --> 39:49.125
was driving in my car,

39:49.209 --> 39:51.626
I remember I got an ice-cold
chill in the back of my neck,

39:51.709 --> 39:54.125
and I felt my hairs on the back
of my neck stand up,

39:54.209 --> 39:56.542
and I felt that it was
your wife thanking me

39:56.626 --> 39:59.250
for having this guy confess

39:59.334 --> 40:00.709
so your daughter doesn't have
to go through life

40:00.792 --> 40:03.125
thinking it was a suicide.

40:04.209 --> 40:07.125
[soft dramatic music]

40:13.125 --> 40:14.876
- The stories
that he had told

40:14.959 --> 40:16.209
when he gave his confession,

40:16.292 --> 40:18.292
which was a total
made-up story

40:18.375 --> 40:22.500
about noise complaints
and her coming downstairs

40:22.584 --> 40:23.834
and slapping him in the face,

40:23.918 --> 40:26.292
that was all made up.

40:26.375 --> 40:28.959
And then
when his plea was accepted,

40:29.042 --> 40:31.667
his story at that time
was that he followed her up

40:31.751 --> 40:34.709
and attempted to rob her,
and she caught him.

40:36.459 --> 40:39.500
We've got them to agree
to 25 years,

40:39.584 --> 40:42.500
no parole, no appeal,

40:42.584 --> 40:44.209
guaranteed.

40:45.709 --> 40:48.500
At the time, it seemed
like a really good deal.

40:48.584 --> 40:52.459
But now that he's much closer
to being out,

40:52.542 --> 40:55.959
it starts to really feel like

40:56.042 --> 40:57.459
that was no sentence.

40:57.542 --> 40:59.500
She died.
She died a horrible death

40:59.584 --> 41:02.334
at the age of 40, and he'll be,

41:02.417 --> 41:05.083
you know, 45 when he's out.

41:05.167 --> 41:07.751
Like, you know?

41:07.834 --> 41:11.167
So that 25 years
is gonna go by real quick.

41:14.792 --> 41:17.417
I think I first started
to think about meeting him

41:17.500 --> 41:19.709
about a year
after Adrienne died.

41:19.792 --> 41:24.000
It was largely born out of
a feeling of being unsettled

41:24.083 --> 41:26.334
in terms of what happened
that day.

41:26.417 --> 41:29.500
And there's only one person
on this planet

41:29.584 --> 41:31.500
that knows what happened
that day who's still alive,

41:31.584 --> 41:33.042
and that's him.

41:35.292 --> 41:39.459
"Diego Pillco, you'll
probably recognize my name.

41:39.542 --> 41:41.334
"I'm Adrienne Shelly's
husband.

41:41.417 --> 41:44.042
"11 years has passed
since that fateful day

41:44.125 --> 41:45.751
"in November 2006.

41:45.834 --> 41:49.042
"So many lives profoundly
changed that day,

41:49.125 --> 41:51.626
"including yours.

41:51.709 --> 41:53.250
"Not a minute
of every day goes by

41:53.334 --> 41:56.292
"without me thinking of
Adrienne and what I've lost,

41:56.375 --> 42:00.250
"what my daughter Sophie,
who is now 14, has lost,

42:00.334 --> 42:02.459
"what the world has lost.

42:02.542 --> 42:05.918
"I would like to talk with you
about what happened that day.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.709
Will you agree to meet
and talk with me?"

42:14.792 --> 42:16.918
- Oh!
- Ow, watch where you're--

42:17.000 --> 42:18.334
Hey.
- Hey, hi, Adrienne.

42:18.417 --> 42:19.542
- Hi, Tim.
- Good to see you.

42:19.626 --> 42:21.209
- Good to see you too.
- Hey, what are you doing?

42:21.292 --> 42:22.542
- Oh, I don't know--
- Do you have a minute

42:22.626 --> 42:24.375
to talk
about "Sudden Manhattan"?

42:24.459 --> 42:27.709
- I certainly have a minute to
talk about "Sudden Manhattan."

42:27.792 --> 42:30.792
Six, seven, eight.

42:30.876 --> 42:32.792
Eight zits.

42:32.876 --> 42:35.083
One less than yesterday.

42:35.167 --> 42:36.626
What happened
to the missing zit?

42:36.709 --> 42:39.250
Where'd it go?

42:39.334 --> 42:40.626
Hmm.

42:40.709 --> 42:42.626
One zit less.

42:45.626 --> 42:47.083
Well,
I wanted to make this movie

42:47.167 --> 42:49.250
because I think
it's sort of an analogy

42:49.334 --> 42:52.417
to being in your 20s, being
at a certain point in your life

42:52.500 --> 42:55.918
where, you know, a lot of
strange things are happening

42:56.000 --> 42:57.918
to you and you can't
really make any sense of--

42:58.000 --> 42:59.584
of them.

43:01.834 --> 43:04.834
I'm stuck in a vortex.

43:04.918 --> 43:07.709
I'm stuck
in a vortex.

43:07.792 --> 43:12.000
It's really about, uh,
trying to find meaning

43:12.083 --> 43:15.667
in a world
that is often very confusing.

43:15.751 --> 43:17.876
- And then she steals
the carrot out of my mouth,

43:17.959 --> 43:20.500
and she hop, hop, hops away.

43:20.584 --> 43:24.375
And my voice tells me,
"Bonnie, you dumb bunny.

43:24.459 --> 43:26.667
She wants you to follow."

43:26.751 --> 43:29.250
[distorted] Then he took
the gun and shot the man dead

43:29.334 --> 43:30.792
in plain daylight.

43:30.876 --> 43:31.959
- That film was nuts, right?

43:32.042 --> 43:33.292
Like, what did you think of it?
- It was nuts.

43:33.375 --> 43:35.459
Like, it always amazed me,
Adrienne would say,

43:35.542 --> 43:38.000
"I'm writing this thing,"
then suddenly she would call

43:38.083 --> 43:41.417
three weeks later
and say, "We have funding."

43:41.500 --> 43:42.500
I don't know how it happened.
- Right.

43:42.584 --> 43:44.626
- It just--somehow,
she knew someone and knew--

43:44.709 --> 43:47.626
and she just got on the phone
and worked connections

43:47.709 --> 43:49.751
and called people,
and they read her work

43:49.834 --> 43:51.042
and liked it,
so they produced it.

43:52.417 --> 43:54.334
- Tea leaves, palm readings,
aura readings,

43:54.417 --> 43:57.375
tarot cards, astrology,
past life readings,

43:57.459 --> 44:00.375
or guardian angel information.

44:00.459 --> 44:02.542
- Uh, no, I don't--
I don't think--

44:02.626 --> 44:05.459
- Or I can do all of them
at the same time.

44:05.542 --> 44:07.417
- You do all of them
at the same time?

44:07.500 --> 44:08.417
- Mm-hmm.

44:08.500 --> 44:10.042
- I think it was
"Sudden Manhattan,"

44:10.125 --> 44:13.500
and she was having a lot of
difficulty with the reception,

44:13.584 --> 44:16.334
and she got a negative review
somewhere,

44:16.417 --> 44:17.876
and she called me.

44:20.083 --> 44:22.083
And she was just crying...

44:22.167 --> 44:24.834
- No reason
to get out of bed.

44:24.918 --> 44:26.292
- For several hours,

44:26.375 --> 44:29.000
because somebody had
ripped her to shreds.

44:29.083 --> 44:32.083
- No reason to brush my teeth.

44:32.167 --> 44:33.918
- What Adrienne found
in making that movie

44:34.000 --> 44:37.083
is that being in the movie,
writing it, and directing it,

44:37.167 --> 44:40.417
critics were not going to be
kind to a woman who did that.

44:40.500 --> 44:43.000
- Right.
- And I really do feel

44:43.083 --> 44:46.626
there was tremendous sexism
that made that

44:46.709 --> 44:48.709
a hard thing to do.

44:48.792 --> 44:51.542
[dramatic romantic music]

44:53.292 --> 44:55.626
[doorbell rings]

44:55.709 --> 44:57.542
- Mahjong.

44:57.626 --> 44:59.417
all: Mahjong!

44:59.500 --> 45:01.792
- I said to her,
"Tell me about this character.

45:01.876 --> 45:05.083
I mean, what are you really
looking for?"

45:05.167 --> 45:06.918
What I wanna know is...

45:08.417 --> 45:12.250
Do you wanna go to Spain
with me and make love?

45:12.334 --> 45:14.000
And she said, "Well," she said

45:14.083 --> 45:16.125
"This character's really based
on my mother."

45:16.209 --> 45:17.542
- You know Missy.
- Hi, Lois.

45:17.626 --> 45:19.292
- Missy's taking Mona's place
in the mahjong game.

45:19.375 --> 45:21.792
- How's it going?

45:21.876 --> 45:23.626
- It's--
it's going well.

45:23.709 --> 45:26.209
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I'm having a good time.

45:26.292 --> 45:28.792
Somebody's agreed
to let me make a movie again.

45:28.876 --> 45:30.834
And that's, um--

45:30.918 --> 45:33.709
that never, you know,
fails to surprise me

45:33.792 --> 45:35.751
and delight me.

45:35.834 --> 45:37.542
It's called
"Get Up and Recover."

45:37.626 --> 45:38.834
- Oh, Lucy.

45:38.918 --> 45:41.334
- There are all
these great exercises in here,

45:41.417 --> 45:45.209
not just to, um...
forget your misery

45:45.292 --> 45:49.417
but to go forward,
to face your pain.

45:49.500 --> 45:51.375
You know,
to strengthen your soul.

45:51.459 --> 45:52.709
- There's nothing wrong
with my soul.

45:52.792 --> 45:56.209
- This is exactly the situation
that life offers you

45:56.292 --> 45:59.000
a real opportunity to grow.

45:59.083 --> 46:02.167
There's--there's not really
one breakup in particular

46:02.250 --> 46:04.292
that inspired this film.

46:04.375 --> 46:07.667
I think I've probably been
all of the characters

46:07.751 --> 46:09.626
in the film
at one time or another.

46:09.709 --> 46:12.500
I set up a date for you.

46:12.584 --> 46:15.292
- Are you kidding?
- With Bernice.

46:15.375 --> 46:18.083
My friend from college,
she just moved here from LA.

46:18.167 --> 46:19.417
- You did what?

46:19.500 --> 46:21.542
- You told me
you thought she was cute.

46:21.626 --> 46:25.167
- That was eight years ago.
I met her for five minutes.

46:25.250 --> 46:26.459
- Bill, you gotta move forward.

46:26.542 --> 46:27.626
You gotta move forward, Bill.

46:27.709 --> 46:30.584
- I can't go on a date, Lucy.
I can't tie my shoes.

46:30.667 --> 46:32.959
What are you talking about,
a date?

46:33.042 --> 46:34.792
Cancel it.
- I can't.

46:34.876 --> 46:37.459
- Why not?
[doorbell buzzes]

46:39.417 --> 46:40.751
- Hi.

46:40.834 --> 46:45.834
- I was going for a tone
in the film where--

46:45.918 --> 46:50.709
where you can kind of find
what's funny in what's painful.

46:50.792 --> 46:52.167
Um, which has always kind of

46:52.250 --> 46:54.751
been my strategy anyway
in life, you know.

46:54.834 --> 46:57.834
I think it's a great
sort of survival technique.

47:00.709 --> 47:02.667
- "Oddly enough,
I believe that the person

47:02.751 --> 47:05.000
"who's had the greatest
influence on my creative life

47:05.083 --> 47:06.626
has been my father."

47:08.083 --> 47:09.375
"The reason why this is unusual

47:09.459 --> 47:12.334
"is that I have not
seen my father in 18 years.

47:12.417 --> 47:14.876
"He died very suddenly
when I was 12.

47:14.959 --> 47:16.667
"He was 40 years old.

47:16.751 --> 47:18.209
"This was to begin my strange

47:18.292 --> 47:20.417
"and ugly companionship
with grief.

47:20.500 --> 47:22.667
"Learning to cope with loss
has been an odyssey

47:22.751 --> 47:24.167
for me throughout my life."

47:24.250 --> 47:26.626
- One of the most
incredible moments

47:26.709 --> 47:28.834
I ever had with Adrienne

47:28.918 --> 47:31.667
was when she told me

47:31.751 --> 47:33.292
what she remembered
from that day.

47:33.375 --> 47:34.959
- From when her father--
[gasps]

47:35.042 --> 47:36.292
And what was that?

47:36.375 --> 47:38.584
- She was picked up at camp.
- Right, right.

47:38.667 --> 47:41.709
- She said it was a--
a long ride home,

47:41.792 --> 47:43.375
and she literally was
staring out the window,

47:43.459 --> 47:46.250
wondering, "What is going on?"

47:46.334 --> 47:48.667
And she said,
"I went into the house,

47:48.751 --> 47:51.083
"and I walked into the kitchen,

47:51.167 --> 47:53.834
"and on the kitchen table

47:53.918 --> 47:55.751
was an obituary
from the newspaper."

47:55.834 --> 47:57.334
- [gasps]
Oh!

47:57.417 --> 48:00.125
- So here--here's--
here's the incredible part.

48:00.209 --> 48:02.876
She faked not knowing...

48:02.959 --> 48:04.292
- Yeah.
- Because she didn't want...

48:04.375 --> 48:06.125
- Oh.
- To make you feel bad.

48:06.209 --> 48:09.792
The way she told me this story,
she started laughing.

48:09.876 --> 48:11.792
And she said to me,
"Can you believe this?

48:11.876 --> 48:14.459
This is how I found out
how my father died."

48:15.334 --> 48:20.083
The tonal shift is really
what she brought to her work.

48:20.167 --> 48:22.459
Just the horror and the comedy

48:22.542 --> 48:26.459
all wrapped
into one crazy moment.

48:26.542 --> 48:29.417
- "When loss--the fear of it
as well as the truth of it--

48:29.500 --> 48:32.250
"runs your life, there is not
much room in your life

48:32.334 --> 48:34.542
for other things, like love."

48:47.918 --> 48:50.042
That's it.
- That's it?

48:50.125 --> 48:51.500
- Yes.
- No more?

48:51.584 --> 48:53.042
- No.
- Did you have fun?

48:53.125 --> 48:55.000
- Yes.
- Yeah, is that a fun car?

48:55.083 --> 48:57.876
- Yes.
- Why is it fun?

48:57.959 --> 48:59.584
- Because you bought it.

48:59.667 --> 49:00.792
- Because I bought it?

49:00.876 --> 49:01.959
- Yes.
- Oh, that's nice.

49:02.042 --> 49:03.292
So are you a good driver?

49:03.375 --> 49:05.500
- Good job.

49:05.584 --> 49:07.417
- I think it was about
three weeks later, maybe--

49:07.500 --> 49:10.083
no, a month later.

49:10.167 --> 49:11.959
You--
you wanted to get Sophie--

49:12.042 --> 49:13.167
you got--you just wanted
to get her out of--

49:13.250 --> 49:14.334
you needed to get
out of New York.

49:14.417 --> 49:15.792
And you came to visit.

49:16.751 --> 49:19.626
I remember opening the door
and--and...

49:19.709 --> 49:21.834
you and Sophie walking
up the walkway there,

49:21.918 --> 49:23.709
opening the gate.

49:23.792 --> 49:25.334
And I remember...

49:26.959 --> 49:28.918
It wasn't three of you.
It was two of you.

49:30.500 --> 49:33.792
- I had a lot of people
who would say things

49:33.876 --> 49:35.250
like, "Everything's
gonna be okay,"

49:35.334 --> 49:36.375
"You'll get through it,"

49:36.459 --> 49:38.751
all the things
that nice people say

49:38.834 --> 49:42.209
when they care about you and
want to make you feel better.

49:42.292 --> 49:43.417
I remember this one guy

49:43.500 --> 49:46.500
whose son committed suicide
many years earlier,

49:46.584 --> 49:49.918
and then he contacted me
right away, and he was like,

49:50.000 --> 49:51.042
"Here's what's gonna
happen day one.

49:51.125 --> 49:53.125
"Here's what's gonna happen
month one, month two,

49:53.209 --> 49:54.417
year one, year two."

49:54.500 --> 49:55.834
He laid out, like, a blueprint

49:55.918 --> 49:57.500
of, like, how often I'll cry.

49:57.584 --> 49:59.334
I found that invaluable.

49:59.417 --> 50:02.000
Uh, my friend Julie Rudd,

50:02.083 --> 50:05.918
uh, had a fiancé who died
in a horrible work accident.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.375
- I think it might
have been a week later

50:08.459 --> 50:10.417
that you called me,
and I was like,

50:10.500 --> 50:14.083
"Oh, he--this is--he's--
he's gonna be okay,

50:14.167 --> 50:18.918
"because he is already looking
to climb himself out.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.626
"You know, he doesn't
wanna stay where he is,

50:21.709 --> 50:25.042
and he knows he can't, because
he's got a young daughter."

50:25.125 --> 50:28.542
- Was there ever a moment
where...

50:28.626 --> 50:32.042
you didn't think you would
be able to move on from this?

50:32.125 --> 50:33.417
- No.

50:34.667 --> 50:36.500
No, not in that sense.

50:36.584 --> 50:38.876
But I had really dark moments--

50:38.959 --> 50:40.709
dark, dark, dark moments,

50:40.792 --> 50:43.709
going in that closet
in the back,

50:43.792 --> 50:46.792
taking her clothes
and curling up on a--

50:46.876 --> 50:49.792
fetal position on the floor
and just sobbing

50:49.876 --> 50:52.709
till I literally
had nothing left.

50:52.792 --> 50:55.959
But then over, you know,
the next few days,

50:56.042 --> 50:59.083
the next week, two weeks,
three weeks, four weeks,

50:59.167 --> 51:02.792
all of a sudden, you know,
a routine settles in.

51:02.876 --> 51:05.250
I just looked at her
and made her a promise

51:05.334 --> 51:09.209
that she's gonna grow up happy
and healthy.

51:09.292 --> 51:11.417
We're gonna be okay.

51:11.500 --> 51:13.918
Like, we're a team.
We're gonna be okay.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.918
[soft music]

51:19.042 --> 51:21.626
- I don't want you
to be sad, okay, Daddy?

51:21.709 --> 51:23.584
- You think Daddy looks sad?
- Yes.

51:23.667 --> 51:26.125
But I'm gonna take care
of you when Mommy died.

51:26.209 --> 51:28.167
- I'm so lucky to have you.

51:29.375 --> 51:30.667
- You be so proud of me,

51:30.751 --> 51:33.834
and you not be sad anymore
that Mommy died.

51:33.918 --> 51:36.167
I like Mommy's picture
up there.

51:36.250 --> 51:38.792
- Mommy's watching over her
little girl while she sleeps.

51:38.876 --> 51:40.667
- She's watching me?
- Yes.

51:40.751 --> 51:43.334
She'll always be with you,
everywhere you go.

51:54.167 --> 51:56.250
How do you feel about,
like, today

51:56.334 --> 51:59.083
versus other days?

52:00.542 --> 52:03.125
- It doesn't really
feel very different

52:03.209 --> 52:06.334
than most days, like,
'cause it's just a day,

52:06.417 --> 52:08.125
but it just happens to be,
like, when--

52:08.209 --> 52:10.042
like,
an anniversary of something,

52:10.125 --> 52:13.209
so it's, like,
always in the back of my mind.

52:13.292 --> 52:15.709
It's not like
it's harder today.

52:15.792 --> 52:18.209
I think it's only harder

52:18.292 --> 52:21.542
because
I'm thinking about it more

52:21.626 --> 52:23.792
than I would
on a different day.

52:23.876 --> 52:26.918
- Are there days
or holidays in particular

52:27.000 --> 52:29.167
more so than other days
or other holidays

52:29.250 --> 52:31.000
that make you think more
about that?

52:31.083 --> 52:33.792
- Well, Halloween,
'cause it's right there,

52:33.876 --> 52:35.334
and the party you guys threw.

52:35.417 --> 52:38.542
- Mm-hmm.
- Um, Mother's Day, obviously.

52:38.626 --> 52:39.792
- Mm-hmm.
- Um--

52:39.876 --> 52:43.209
- What do you typically feel
on Mother's Day?

52:43.292 --> 52:46.667
- Um, just kind of like, um,

52:46.751 --> 52:48.834
like, robbed.

52:48.918 --> 52:50.918
Like, I'm just jealous all day.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.584
Just 'cause of,
like, other people

52:53.667 --> 52:55.417
and, like, their moms.

52:55.500 --> 52:57.667
Like, I'm jealous of that.

52:57.751 --> 53:00.209
I'm understanding now
how permanent it is.

53:00.292 --> 53:01.626
- Mm-hmm.
- That's hard to deal with,

53:01.709 --> 53:05.417
but it's mostly just like,
I'm never going to have one.

53:05.500 --> 53:08.292
Like, the permanency of that.
- Mm-hmm.

53:18.959 --> 53:21.375
- Hi.

53:21.459 --> 53:25.375
It's me, Adrienne, and, uh--

53:25.459 --> 53:28.375
and I just started shooting
this documentary

53:28.459 --> 53:30.042
a few days ago.

53:30.125 --> 53:32.459
- One of the things
that I've discovered

53:32.542 --> 53:34.792
through this process
is, Adrienne--

53:34.876 --> 53:35.834
and maybe you know about it,
Adrienne was

53:35.918 --> 53:37.417
making a documentary
about happiness.

53:37.500 --> 53:38.792
Do you know anything
about that?

53:38.876 --> 53:43.292
-  There's too many things
I haven't done yet

53:43.375 --> 53:46.834
There's too many sunsets

53:46.918 --> 53:50.834
I haven't seen

53:50.918 --> 53:55.375
You can't waste the day
wishing it'd slow down

53:55.459 --> 53:58.542
You would've thought
by now

53:58.626 --> 53:59.542
- I have the tapes.

53:59.626 --> 54:00.667
- That's amazing.
- And they're amazing.

54:00.751 --> 54:03.918
[Sara Bareilles'
"Many the Miles"]

54:04.000 --> 54:05.709
[doorbell rings]

54:05.792 --> 54:08.417
- We're making a--
a documentary about happiness.

54:08.500 --> 54:10.584
I'm assuming you're a couple.
- We are.

54:10.667 --> 54:12.459
- We're--we're actually looking
for the happiest person

54:12.542 --> 54:13.792
in New York.

54:13.876 --> 54:16.500
- We're pretty happy.
Erica makes me happy.

54:16.584 --> 54:18.375
- Aww.
This is for you.

54:18.459 --> 54:19.918
- What is--this is for me?
- It's a yo-yo.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.959
- Oh, how very nice.
I shall play with this at home.

54:23.042 --> 54:24.667
[laughter]

54:24.751 --> 54:27.792
- We went, uh, my boyfriend
and I, to see, um...

54:27.876 --> 54:29.459
Burt Bacharach
and Elvis Costello

54:29.542 --> 54:31.167
in concert at Carnegie Hall.

54:31.250 --> 54:32.667
I used to come here
for breakfast--

54:32.751 --> 54:35.334
it was a breakfast place--
with my ex-boyfriend.

54:35.417 --> 54:37.500
And, uh, it was really painful
because we knew

54:37.584 --> 54:40.292
that we were gonna end
our relationship that night.

54:40.375 --> 54:42.167
We used to fight a lot here.

54:42.250 --> 54:45.000
We were just kind of
frozen there in our seats

54:45.083 --> 54:47.626
listening to them sing
this stuff.

54:47.709 --> 54:50.000
And then finally,
uh, we broke up here.

54:50.083 --> 54:53.709
And I remember feeling like,
"Ugh, yeah, pain!

54:53.792 --> 54:56.375
Ugh, yeah, life--
give it to me, give it to me."

54:56.459 --> 55:00.042
And the place, uh, was a place
I think of misery and failure

55:00.125 --> 55:02.125
for the owners also, 'cause
they went out of business,

55:02.209 --> 55:05.209
and it became
another restaurant altogether.

55:05.292 --> 55:07.709
We were very specifically
looking for a restaurant

55:07.792 --> 55:09.709
to break up in,
and finally, uh,

55:09.792 --> 55:14.209
we settled into
Ollie's Noodle Shop and Grill.

55:14.292 --> 55:18.459
I came back, um, with a--
with a new boyfriend,

55:18.542 --> 55:21.250
and, uh--and he broke up
with me here too.

55:21.334 --> 55:22.834
I listened to him
tell me everything

55:22.918 --> 55:25.834
that was wrong with me
and how I had failed him.

55:25.918 --> 55:27.667
And then shortly after that,

55:27.751 --> 55:30.167
uh, that restaurant
went out of business.

55:30.250 --> 55:32.834
And I sat there and told him
everything that he did wrong

55:32.918 --> 55:35.292
and how he failed me.

55:35.375 --> 55:39.292
And, uh--and it was just--
it was just awful.

55:39.375 --> 55:43.209
So I try to stay away from here
if I can,

55:43.292 --> 55:47.292
um, not bring any beaus here,

55:47.375 --> 55:50.042
because they're just
gonna break up with me,

55:50.125 --> 55:52.125
and--and then
the restaurant's gonna close.

55:52.209 --> 55:54.959
- She had so many
crappy relationships.

55:55.042 --> 55:58.042
- So many, so many.
- I often think about, like,

55:58.125 --> 55:59.500
she was smart,
she was beautiful.

55:59.584 --> 56:01.876
Like,
she had everything to offer.

56:01.959 --> 56:03.876
- I want, you know,
very different things now

56:03.959 --> 56:06.250
than when I was younger.

56:06.334 --> 56:09.042
And I'd like to think that,
you know, I could...

56:11.792 --> 56:15.709
Spend my life with somebody
and have a family and, uh--

56:15.792 --> 56:20.417
and still be allowed
to be myself, you know?

56:20.500 --> 56:21.792
- And was it just the--
- I think

56:21.876 --> 56:24.626
that a lot of men

56:24.709 --> 56:30.125
felt that here was this tiny,
little, adorable woman

56:30.209 --> 56:33.292
that they were going
to take care of

56:33.375 --> 56:36.167
and protect and control.

56:36.250 --> 56:39.250
And she had no intention
of that happening.

56:39.334 --> 56:43.375
She was tiny
but very large in personality

56:43.459 --> 56:47.876
and in mind and in deed
and in will.

56:47.959 --> 56:49.792
- Are you in love?

56:49.876 --> 56:51.000
- No.
I'm in love,

56:51.083 --> 56:52.584
but, um, I don't know with--

56:52.667 --> 56:53.918
I mean,
he's somewhere out there.

56:54.000 --> 56:55.083
I don't know where he is.

56:55.167 --> 56:57.167
I'm--I have all this love
inside of me

56:57.250 --> 57:00.083
and no one to give it to now.

57:00.167 --> 57:02.626
- And because I'm--
I'm on this sort of quest

57:02.709 --> 57:05.792
to figure out what happiness
is in this documentary,

57:05.876 --> 57:11.500
I guess I--I should...
probably admit that, uh,

57:11.584 --> 57:15.667
I--I'm not really
such an expert on it.

57:17.083 --> 57:19.834
- The conversation that we used
to have quite a bit

57:19.918 --> 57:21.709
is, what's more important
to us?

57:21.792 --> 57:24.500
Is having love and marriage
more important to us?

57:24.584 --> 57:27.417
Or is it more im--is our art
more important to us?

57:27.500 --> 57:29.417
And we would have those debates
a lot.

57:29.500 --> 57:33.459
And Adrienne fell into the camp
of, "Love and marriage

57:33.542 --> 57:36.167
is ultimately more important
to me."

57:36.250 --> 57:39.167
- Are you happy?
- I'm content.

57:39.250 --> 57:41.167
- Knowing her
and knowing how passionate

57:41.250 --> 57:43.709
about her work she was,
I was surprised.

57:43.792 --> 57:46.250
But thinking back on it,
I'm not.

57:46.334 --> 57:48.876
- "I want love to work.
I want no more pain.

57:48.959 --> 57:50.876
"I want to have a child
and a family.

57:50.959 --> 57:53.250
"I want to create marvelous
things from my heart and mind

57:53.334 --> 57:55.042
and hands and mouth."

57:55.125 --> 57:57.042
- I remember when I first came
to New York,

57:57.125 --> 57:59.000
when I first moved to New York,
I--

57:59.083 --> 58:01.375
I, um--
I--I--

58:01.459 --> 58:03.042
I said the same kind of thing
to myself,

58:03.125 --> 58:04.751
that, you know,
he's somewhere here.

58:04.834 --> 58:06.792
- He has to be.
- Wonder where he is

58:06.876 --> 58:08.000
and what he's doing right now

58:08.083 --> 58:10.584
and if he's wondering
where I am, you know.

58:11.459 --> 58:16.209
I want to be part of something
that's bigger than just me.

58:18.375 --> 58:19.959
- She wanted to be loved.

58:20.042 --> 58:24.083
You know, talking to her a few
late nights where she really

58:24.167 --> 58:25.876
had the feeling
she would never be loved

58:25.959 --> 58:27.125
and it would never happen.

58:27.209 --> 58:29.918
And I knew
that was literally impossible.

58:30.000 --> 58:31.959
This is just
what's happening now.

58:32.042 --> 58:33.792
That person is out there.

58:33.876 --> 58:36.250
And of course he was,
and it was you.

58:39.000 --> 58:42.584
- She met you, um,
as I believe, after 9/11.

58:42.667 --> 58:44.459
You were volunteering downtown.

58:44.542 --> 58:45.626
- No, no, no, no.
- She said she met you

58:45.709 --> 58:47.584
at a political fundraiser.

58:47.667 --> 58:49.209
- What?
She said to me,

58:49.292 --> 58:51.417
you know, like a lot of people
after 9/11,

58:51.500 --> 58:52.876
you know, you start
reassessing your life.

58:52.959 --> 58:54.334
- Right.
- Like, "What am I doing?"

58:54.417 --> 58:55.500
- So it was after 9/11?
- It was right after--

58:55.584 --> 58:56.542
- So I got that part right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:56.626 --> 58:58.083
- She told me that you guys met

58:58.167 --> 59:01.125
at a political fundraiser.

59:01.209 --> 59:03.876
- Did you volunteer
with her after together?

59:03.959 --> 59:05.000
- She told me she went
on Match,

59:05.083 --> 59:06.209
and she was embarrassed.

59:06.292 --> 59:08.584
She was a little, like,
"I don't want anyone to know."

59:08.667 --> 59:10.209
Hi, now everybody knows.

59:10.292 --> 59:11.959
I supported her instantly.
I said, "Great.

59:12.042 --> 59:14.167
"That's how people--
you know, it's--you know,

59:14.250 --> 59:15.667
people meet people
that way now."

59:15.751 --> 59:17.876
I mean,
it's a great way to get outside

59:17.959 --> 59:20.083
of the sphere
of just show business.

59:20.167 --> 59:23.083
And she made it clear, like,
"I only went to one person.

59:23.167 --> 59:27.459
I saw his profile picture,
I chose it, and that was that."

59:27.542 --> 59:29.959
She made one connection.
It was you.

59:30.042 --> 59:33.250
- Listen, um, I have a
five-minute blind date tonight

59:33.334 --> 59:35.292
with an insurance salesman
named Pete--

59:35.375 --> 59:39.167
5'10", 37, all his hair,
nice picture, loves fishin'.

59:39.250 --> 59:40.167
- Five-minute date?

59:40.250 --> 59:41.542
Can't the guy pay
for the whole thing?

59:41.626 --> 59:42.959
- She literally said to me,

59:43.042 --> 59:44.834
"We're gonna go
on a five-minute date."

59:45.542 --> 59:47.626
That was the first time
I heard that idea.

59:47.709 --> 59:49.375
And I said,
"How does that work?"

59:49.459 --> 59:50.959
She explained the whole thing.

59:51.042 --> 59:53.500
She said, "I show up,
I look at you, you look at me,

59:53.584 --> 59:55.209
"and we talk for five minutes,
we hate each other.

59:55.292 --> 59:57.542
Like, why--what's the point
of staying, like, longer?"

59:57.626 --> 59:59.709
And we sat there
for five hours.

59:59.792 --> 1:00:01.876
The five-minute date
became five hours.

1:00:03.250 --> 1:00:05.584
- I got a secret too.

1:00:05.667 --> 1:00:07.375
- You, Dawn?
- Yes.

1:00:07.459 --> 1:00:08.959

"You know, I can't believe it,

said, "The Adrienne Shelly?"

1:01:22.876 --> 1:01:26.209
- I just got an Eiffel Tower
for one euro,

1:01:26.292 --> 1:01:27.751
but he gave me another one
for free.

1:01:27.834 --> 1:01:29.876
- Ooh, cool.
- So nice.

1:01:31.125 --> 1:01:33.792
- I proposed to her that
following summer in Paris.

I carried the ring with me
everywhere we went.

Like, was it a surprise?
Did you walk up--

- Well,
we walked up this street,

1:01:46.292 --> 1:01:48.751
and I told your mom
that ever since I met her,

I'd been really happy
and I can't imagine

1:01:53.334 --> 1:01:54.500

So after Daddy proposed,
we came down here.

And we just sat here,

no one's ever
asked you this before?"

1:09:14.626 --> 1:09:18.334
- I mean, would you call
yourself a happy man?

1:09:18.417 --> 1:09:19.709
- Well, if you're
asking me a serious question,

1:09:19.792 --> 1:09:21.876
I'll tell you.

1:09:21.959 --> 1:09:24.000
I'm happy enough.

1:09:24.083 --> 1:09:25.542
I don't expect much.

1:09:25.626 --> 1:09:27.000
I don't give much.

1:09:27.083 --> 1:09:28.792
I don't get much.

1:09:28.876 --> 1:09:31.209
I generally enjoy
whatever comes up.

1:09:33.167 --> 1:09:34.751
That's my truth,

1:09:34.834 --> 1:09:37.751
summed up
for your feminine judgment.

1:09:37.834 --> 1:09:40.083
I'm happy enough.

1:09:40.167 --> 1:09:42.417
- I felt safe, because I knew

1:09:42.500 --> 1:09:44.918
that if she didn't get
what she wanted,

1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:46.709
she wouldn't stop, you know?

1:09:46.792 --> 1:09:48.083
That's really what it--
as an actor,

1:09:48.167 --> 1:09:50.918
you just wanna feel like--
like she knows what she wants,

1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:53.042
she knows when she gets it,
and--

1:09:53.125 --> 1:09:55.459
you know, and that she has--
and she knows when I'm--

1:09:55.542 --> 1:09:57.542
I'm not doing it.

1:09:57.626 --> 1:09:58.667
[glass shatters]

1:09:58.751 --> 1:10:01.125
[all gasping, murmuring]

1:10:02.334 --> 1:10:04.417
Jenna,

1:10:04.500 --> 1:10:06.375
I'm very upset with you.

1:10:12.792 --> 1:10:14.167
- Well, of course, you remember
none of this, right?

1:10:14.250 --> 1:10:16.584
- Mm-mm. Just from the movie.
- Uh-huh.

1:10:17.876 --> 1:10:19.083
Brings back a lot
of memories.

1:10:21.751 --> 1:10:24.083
- Bye.
- Bye.

1:10:24.167 --> 1:10:26.292
- We--we went to the road,

1:10:26.375 --> 1:10:28.959
like, um, that we walked in
at the end of the movie.

1:10:29.042 --> 1:10:30.667
- No way!
- Yeah.

1:10:30.751 --> 1:10:34.292
Bye-bye-bye.
[squealing]

1:10:34.375 --> 1:10:36.292
- [chuckles]
Bye.

1:10:36.375 --> 1:10:37.417
I mean, you were too little.
- Yeah.

1:10:37.500 --> 1:10:38.918
- You probably
don't even remember that.

1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:40.834
I remember that.
- She doesn't remember.

1:10:40.918 --> 1:10:43.292
- You wouldn't let your mom
out of your sight.

1:10:43.375 --> 1:10:47.250
And, um, so we just had--
she had to run and hide

1:10:47.334 --> 1:10:49.709
behind a bush,
and I was just holding you

1:10:49.792 --> 1:10:51.792
until you kind of calmed down,

1:10:51.876 --> 1:10:54.042
and then we sort of sang
together.

1:10:55.375 --> 1:10:59.334
Baby, don't cry,
gonna make a pie

1:10:59.417 --> 1:11:04.792
Hold you forever
in the middle of my heart

1:11:10.626 --> 1:11:14.959
- On the Monday
when we learned of the arrest,

1:11:15.042 --> 1:11:17.876
that's when we also learned
that "Waitress" had

1:11:17.959 --> 1:11:20.459
been accepted into Sundance.

1:11:20.542 --> 1:11:23.459
- I'm sure as she was waiting
for Sundance's response,

1:11:23.542 --> 1:11:25.459
she was uncertain
whether or not--

1:11:25.542 --> 1:11:26.626
- Yeah, she had no idea.

1:11:26.709 --> 1:11:28.626
And I remember once saying
to her, like,

1:11:28.709 --> 1:11:32.000
"Do you know
what you have here?"

1:11:32.083 --> 1:11:35.626
And she said, "If it gets into
Sundance and people see it,

1:11:35.709 --> 1:11:36.834
it could be big."

1:11:36.918 --> 1:11:39.375
- I didn't think
about the film.

1:11:39.459 --> 1:11:41.334
After what happened
with Adrienne,

1:11:41.417 --> 1:11:43.209
I didn't think about the film.

1:11:43.292 --> 1:11:46.042
I just--
it seemed insignificant.

1:11:46.125 --> 1:11:48.209
And then, um--

1:11:48.292 --> 1:11:49.792
and then we went to Sundance.

1:11:49.876 --> 1:11:53.584
[soft rock music]

1:11:53.667 --> 1:11:56.000
- Sundance was something
I dreaded going to.

1:11:57.959 --> 1:12:02.083
I knew going in, it was gonna
be one of the hardest things

1:12:02.167 --> 1:12:05.042
that any of us
in the family had to do.

1:12:06.751 --> 1:12:08.667
- You looked ashen.

1:12:09.667 --> 1:12:11.751
You were there,
you were present,

1:12:11.834 --> 1:12:15.667
but it was everything--
every ounce of energy,

1:12:15.751 --> 1:12:19.125
you know, just to be standing
up and functioning right.

1:12:20.334 --> 1:12:23.918
- It's the most heart-wrenching

1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:27.751
and most beautiful thing
that I've ever experienced.

1:12:27.834 --> 1:12:30.083
We were all there, and--
and you were there,

1:12:30.167 --> 1:12:31.459
and your family was there.

1:12:31.542 --> 1:12:35.083
And we watched this movie,
all of us, for the first time.

1:12:38.334 --> 1:12:41.167
[dramatic music playing]

1:12:41.250 --> 1:12:42.375
- Oh.

1:12:43.792 --> 1:12:45.709
Look what you did.

1:12:45.792 --> 1:12:47.709
You made me almost pretty.

1:12:47.792 --> 1:12:50.375
- What do you mean
"almost" pretty?

1:12:50.459 --> 1:12:51.542
You're lovely.

1:12:51.626 --> 1:12:53.834
- Lot of people say how,
obviously, at Sundance,

1:12:53.918 --> 1:12:55.667
you know, just seeing her--

1:12:55.751 --> 1:12:57.959
I know how it was for me,
but seeing her--

1:12:58.042 --> 1:13:00.083
- It was a killer!
Are you kidding?

1:13:00.167 --> 1:13:02.209
- Aw, I'm sorry, hon.

1:13:02.292 --> 1:13:03.459
- I looked,
and then I didn't look.

1:13:03.542 --> 1:13:06.167
I remember I was crying so,

1:13:06.250 --> 1:13:08.083
and there was a man--
I don't know who--

1:13:08.167 --> 1:13:09.918
who he belonged to, whatever,

1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:12.751
and I remember he--
he was, like, trying to--

1:13:12.834 --> 1:13:14.959
"It's okay, it's okay,
don't worry."

1:13:15.042 --> 1:13:17.959
- As soon as the opening
credits started rolling,

1:13:18.042 --> 1:13:19.500
Elaine just buried her head
in my shoulder

1:13:19.584 --> 1:13:20.959
and started
bawling her eyes out.

1:13:21.042 --> 1:13:23.584
"That's my baby, that's
my baby, that's my baby."

1:13:23.667 --> 1:13:25.667
- We were all just confused

1:13:25.751 --> 1:13:28.626
by how that could be a part
of this world,

1:13:28.709 --> 1:13:31.751
that this murder could
be anywhere connected

1:13:31.834 --> 1:13:37.417
to this movie
that was so much about life.

1:13:37.500 --> 1:13:40.042
- Oh, my God.
Here it is.

1:13:40.125 --> 1:13:43.959
A character and script
and story and everything

1:13:44.042 --> 1:13:46.125
that I know so well.

1:13:46.209 --> 1:13:50.125
It just seemed simultaneously

1:13:50.209 --> 1:13:52.584
magical and unfair.

1:13:53.918 --> 1:13:56.459
- Everywhere we went,
people gave you

1:13:56.542 --> 1:14:00.542
such effusive compliments
about being in "Waitress."

1:14:00.626 --> 1:14:02.667
I mean,
I got into every suite,

1:14:02.751 --> 1:14:04.000
I got into every party--

1:14:04.083 --> 1:14:05.500
"Oh, you're in 'Waitress,'
aren't you?"

1:14:05.584 --> 1:14:07.292
I mean, it was the darling.

1:14:07.375 --> 1:14:12.876
- Here was the success
of this film

1:14:12.959 --> 1:14:16.125
by a woman who struggled
as a filmmaker

1:14:16.209 --> 1:14:17.834
to get to this point.

1:14:17.918 --> 1:14:19.626
This was gonna be her moment.

1:14:19.709 --> 1:14:21.626
How are we here

1:14:21.709 --> 1:14:23.334
and she's not?

1:14:23.417 --> 1:14:26.417
[soft music]

1:14:28.125 --> 1:14:32.876
I wanted her there,
so I took a little vial

1:14:32.959 --> 1:14:35.375
of her ashes.

1:14:35.459 --> 1:14:37.709
And I got up really early
that day

1:14:37.792 --> 1:14:40.083
and went to the top
of the hill,

1:14:40.167 --> 1:14:43.042
stood in the middle
of the street,

1:14:43.125 --> 1:14:46.042
and just, like,
walked the yellow line

1:14:46.125 --> 1:14:48.042
and just...

1:14:48.125 --> 1:14:49.709
threw her ashes in the air.

1:14:49.792 --> 1:14:53.000
- No, you never told me that.
- All the way down the street.

1:14:53.083 --> 1:14:57.375
And then that night, I brought
the little vial again,

1:14:57.459 --> 1:15:00.000
and because I wanted her
in the theater.

1:15:00.083 --> 1:15:02.000
This was her moment.

1:15:05.125 --> 1:15:06.834
It was her--
her premiere.

1:15:06.918 --> 1:15:08.542
She had to be there.

1:15:11.459 --> 1:15:15.584
And I remember
throwing ashes in--in the air,

1:15:15.667 --> 1:15:17.584
and Harvey Weinstein walked
right by.

1:15:17.667 --> 1:15:19.375
And they landed on his--
- Whoa.

1:15:19.459 --> 1:15:21.209
- On his shoulders.

1:15:21.292 --> 1:15:26.292
And I just, like,
started laughing on the inside,

1:15:26.375 --> 1:15:29.709
because I just--
like, literally it was as if

1:15:29.792 --> 1:15:32.709
Adrienne was right next to me

1:15:32.792 --> 1:15:37.542
laughing and thinking that was
the funniest thing ever.

1:15:41.083 --> 1:15:44.667
- I started out saying,
"I'm never ever going to speak

1:15:44.751 --> 1:15:46.876
"like it's harder
because I'm a woman.

1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:50.167
That's the last thing I'm ever,
ever gonna do."

1:15:50.250 --> 1:15:53.959
And then, you know,
five years later, I was saying,

1:15:54.042 --> 1:15:56.167
"You know, it really is much
harder because I'm a woman,

1:15:56.250 --> 1:15:58.292
"much harder,
and I want everyone to know.

1:15:58.375 --> 1:16:00.459
And I want to talk about it
constantly."

1:16:00.542 --> 1:16:04.584
And--and then,
now I'm sort of back to feeling

1:16:04.667 --> 1:16:06.334
like it's hard for everybody.

1:16:06.417 --> 1:16:08.584
It's hard.
It's a hard business.

1:16:14.334 --> 1:16:16.417
- I just
made a decision early on

1:16:16.500 --> 1:16:21.918
that I not only need
to accept what happened,

1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:25.876
in that "shit happens,
life's not fair" kind of way,

1:16:25.959 --> 1:16:28.918
but also try
to spin some gold from it,

1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:32.876
to turn what is probably
the most horrifying negative

1:16:32.959 --> 1:16:34.959
I'll ever experience
in my life

1:16:35.042 --> 1:16:38.334
to something positive
somewhere, somehow.

1:16:38.417 --> 1:16:42.834
Um, so that's what
got me started very early on

1:16:42.918 --> 1:16:47.292
on creating a foundation
to support women filmmakers.

1:16:52.083 --> 1:16:55.000
[Sara Bareilles' "Opening Up"]

1:16:56.667 --> 1:17:01.626
- 2007, saw that film,
loved the characters,

1:17:01.709 --> 1:17:03.792
felt for them,
cared about them.

1:17:03.876 --> 1:17:06.959
The storytelling, of course,
a wonderful story.

1:17:07.042 --> 1:17:08.792
It felt like
those characters would reach

1:17:08.876 --> 1:17:11.209
an emotional moment
in their lives

1:17:11.292 --> 1:17:15.250
where they had to burst out
in song or dance.

1:17:15.334 --> 1:17:16.918
-  The day starts
like the rest we've seen

1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:19.918
Another carbon copy
of an old routine

1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:22.584
-  Days keep coming
-  One out, one in

1:17:22.667 --> 1:17:23.918
all:  They keep coming

1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:26.417
- Make that coffee
strong enough to chew.

1:17:27.959 --> 1:17:30.125
- I think in the year 2019,

1:17:30.209 --> 1:17:33.959
we'll be 1,300 performances
deep into our Broadway run.

1:17:34.042 --> 1:17:36.667
I mean, that's preposterous.

1:17:36.751 --> 1:17:40.125
- It was always
really precious to us

1:17:40.209 --> 1:17:43.792
to maintain the integrity of--
of her mission statement

1:17:43.876 --> 1:17:47.500
and the sort of bold
feminism of it.

1:17:47.584 --> 1:17:52.125
- It's delivered
with such humor and fantasy

1:17:52.209 --> 1:17:56.125
with Jenna's pies,
and it's just

1:17:56.209 --> 1:17:59.250
got its own signature tone.

1:17:59.334 --> 1:18:02.417
- There's victory--
there's human victory here

1:18:02.500 --> 1:18:04.250
in--of the best kind.

1:18:04.334 --> 1:18:06.250
-  Sugar

1:18:09.792 --> 1:18:14.083
Sugar, butter,
flour

1:18:17.334 --> 1:18:19.417
- I did a lot
of talking to Adrienne.

1:18:19.500 --> 1:18:22.709
I--like, out loud,
at the piano,

1:18:22.792 --> 1:18:25.709
come on in, come play,
come play with me.

1:18:25.792 --> 1:18:27.334
Let's create something.

1:18:27.417 --> 1:18:30.209
-  She is messy

1:18:30.292 --> 1:18:33.375
But she's kind

1:18:33.459 --> 1:18:37.125
She is lonely

1:18:37.209 --> 1:18:39.584
Most of the time

1:18:39.667 --> 1:18:44.292
She is all of this
mixed up and baked

1:18:44.375 --> 1:18:48.334
In a beautiful pie

1:18:48.417 --> 1:18:52.334
She is gone,
but she used to be

1:18:52.417 --> 1:18:56.375
Mine

1:18:56.459 --> 1:19:00.792
- Jenna's someone who is
endlessly loyal and caretaking

1:19:00.876 --> 1:19:03.334
and self-diminishing.

1:19:03.417 --> 1:19:04.417
- The queen of kindness.

1:19:04.500 --> 1:19:06.083
- The queen of kindness
and goodness

1:19:06.167 --> 1:19:07.459
to--to a fault.

1:19:07.542 --> 1:19:10.751
It's then so powerful
to watch that person,

1:19:10.834 --> 1:19:13.918
which we can all relate to
in some way, shape, or form,

1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:16.042
rise above that limitation.

1:19:16.125 --> 1:19:18.834
And to watch it be a happy
ending, it's so nice.

1:19:18.918 --> 1:19:21.500
-  But used to be

1:19:21.584 --> 1:19:28.542
Mine

1:19:30.709 --> 1:19:33.375
Oh, used to be

1:19:33.459 --> 1:19:40.375
Mine

1:19:45.375 --> 1:19:50.918
We just had this goal
of honoring her.

1:19:51.000 --> 1:19:53.626
And whenever things would
get tough--

1:19:53.709 --> 1:19:57.459
I remember at one point,
I had a sticky up on my mirror

1:19:57.542 --> 1:20:00.334
in Broadway that said,
"It's for Adrienne."

1:20:00.417 --> 1:20:07.083
Mixed up and baked
in a beautiful pie

1:20:09.000 --> 1:20:12.042
She is gone

1:20:12.125 --> 1:20:15.334
But she used to be

1:20:15.417 --> 1:20:20.834
Mine

1:20:20.918 --> 1:20:23.167
[applause]

1:20:23.250 --> 1:20:26.959
- I want to take a moment
to talk about the fifth, uh,

1:20:27.042 --> 1:20:29.918
female on the team,
and that's Adrienne Shelly.

1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:32.959
[cheers and applause]

1:20:36.751 --> 1:20:39.375
For those of who don't know,
but I think most of you do,

1:20:39.459 --> 1:20:43.125
Adrienne wrote, directed,
and was one of the stars

1:20:43.209 --> 1:20:46.417
of the movie "Waitress,"
and she died

1:20:46.500 --> 1:20:49.083
before the movie was bought
at Sundance,

1:20:49.167 --> 1:20:52.876
before she could experience
how embraced

1:20:52.959 --> 1:20:55.250
her beautiful gem
that she created was--

1:20:55.334 --> 1:20:57.459
this beautiful pie she created.

1:20:57.542 --> 1:21:00.751
And she wrote this movie
before the Me Too movement,

1:21:00.834 --> 1:21:03.542
when stories
about quiet bravery of women

1:21:03.626 --> 1:21:05.209
were deemed unimportant.

1:21:05.292 --> 1:21:08.250
And they were impossible to get
made, and she got it made.

1:21:08.334 --> 1:21:11.417
To Adrienne, I think I speak
for all of us when I say,

1:21:11.500 --> 1:21:13.375
as we all look up,

1:21:13.459 --> 1:21:15.751
thank you for taking us
to the moon, moon pie.

1:21:15.834 --> 1:21:18.834
[cheers and applause]

1:21:23.042 --> 1:21:27.792
- I was sobbing the whole time
watching the show.

1:21:27.876 --> 1:21:30.959
And towards the end,
I felt paralyzed.

1:21:31.042 --> 1:21:33.459
Like, I didn't want
to leave the theater.

1:21:33.542 --> 1:21:35.417
I couldn't leave.

1:21:35.500 --> 1:21:38.125
Uh, and eventually,
I made my way out,

1:21:38.209 --> 1:21:40.667
and again, I was,
like, hanging around.

1:21:40.751 --> 1:21:42.876
I didn't know for what.
Like, I just didn't want

1:21:42.959 --> 1:21:45.209
to leave the theater.
It was such--

1:21:45.292 --> 1:21:48.209
I don't know,
this was like my connection

1:21:48.292 --> 1:21:52.125
with Adrienne, this is,
you know, my last kind of...

1:21:54.042 --> 1:21:55.751
Time with her.

1:21:58.167 --> 1:22:00.626
- The thing that I picked up
from working with Hal,

1:22:00.709 --> 1:22:05.709
he gave me a--you know, a sort
of way to drop my own timidity,

1:22:05.792 --> 1:22:09.667
you know, to--to understand
how important it is to--

1:22:09.751 --> 1:22:12.125
if--when you're--
when you're making a film,

1:22:12.209 --> 1:22:15.709
that you should ask for what
it is you want, you know,

1:22:15.792 --> 1:22:19.000
and to not sort of shy away
from what your own,

1:22:19.083 --> 1:22:20.667
uh, ideas are.

1:22:20.751 --> 1:22:23.500
His films are unique and they
could only be made by him.

1:22:23.584 --> 1:22:26.250
And I'm hoping that one day,

1:22:26.334 --> 1:22:29.167
someone might say that
about me too.

1:22:31.209 --> 1:22:34.167
[suspenseful music]

1:22:45.375 --> 1:22:47.250
- Did you ever meet Pillco?

1:22:47.334 --> 1:22:49.209
- I saw him in court a couple
of times.

1:22:49.292 --> 1:22:51.375
- Can I see him?
Show me a picture of him.

1:22:51.459 --> 1:22:53.542
- Yeah,
if that's what you want.

1:22:53.626 --> 1:22:55.918
- Will you ever meet him?
- Yes, someday.

1:22:56.000 --> 1:22:57.083
Not to forgive him

1:22:57.167 --> 1:22:58.918
but to learn the truth
about what he did

1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:01.125
and make him know
how special Mommy was.

1:23:01.209 --> 1:23:02.709
- I'd never forgive him.

1:23:02.792 --> 1:23:04.042
And when you show me
his picture,

1:23:04.125 --> 1:23:07.250
we should draw a mustache, elf
ears, and devil horns on it.

1:23:09.584 --> 1:23:11.500
[phone rings]

1:23:11.584 --> 1:23:13.667
- Here's Sophie.

1:23:13.751 --> 1:23:15.584
Hey, Shmoph.
- Hi.

1:23:15.667 --> 1:23:17.334
How are you feeling
about today?

1:23:17.417 --> 1:23:20.334
- I'm a little nervous
but not as nervous

1:23:20.417 --> 1:23:22.876
as I think I'll probably feel
when I see the prison.

1:23:22.959 --> 1:23:24.667
- Yeah.
Text me if you want.

1:23:24.751 --> 1:23:27.125
- Okay.
I love you so much.

1:23:27.209 --> 1:23:28.209
- Okay,
I love you too so much.

1:23:28.292 --> 1:23:29.250
Good luck.

1:23:30.626 --> 1:23:35.209
- Now, I'm not coming here
'cause I need to beat him up.

1:23:35.292 --> 1:23:37.626
Just want him to be honest.

1:23:37.709 --> 1:23:41.250
You know, I want him
to shed light on stuff,

1:23:41.334 --> 1:23:46.125
and I want him
to acknowledge what he did

1:23:46.209 --> 1:23:50.250
and who he took
and the consequence of that.

1:23:53.542 --> 1:23:55.709
It'd be funny if everything I
said just goes out the window

1:23:55.792 --> 1:23:58.375
and I fly
into some fucking rage.

1:23:58.459 --> 1:24:00.417
Have to be carted out of there

1:24:00.500 --> 1:24:02.083
and that's the end
of the interview.

1:24:04.292 --> 1:24:07.292
[tense music]

1:24:14.209 --> 1:24:16.417
I think I wanna vomit.

1:24:47.667 --> 1:24:50.209
13 years ago, Adrienne died.

1:24:54.918 --> 1:24:57.584
Part of me died that day.

1:24:58.834 --> 1:25:00.834
There's some things I--I--
I need to know,

1:25:00.918 --> 1:25:03.209
some things I'd like to know.

1:25:03.292 --> 1:25:06.083
There's also some things
I'd like you to know.

1:25:06.167 --> 1:25:08.083
That's really
why I'm here today.

1:25:10.250 --> 1:25:11.751
I'm not here to attack you.

1:25:11.834 --> 1:25:13.626
I'm just here to share

1:25:13.709 --> 1:25:17.334
what I've had in my head
for 13 years.

1:25:18.125 --> 1:25:20.417
I'm sure you've had a lot
to think about too.

1:25:21.667 --> 1:25:23.459
- I'm sorry.

1:25:25.542 --> 1:25:28.792
I wish I could go back
and change things.

1:25:28.876 --> 1:25:30.459
I can't.

1:25:31.751 --> 1:25:34.375
[speaking Spanish]

1:25:34.459 --> 1:25:37.167
- I was never aggressive.

1:25:37.250 --> 1:25:38.959
I never hurt anyone.

1:25:40.667 --> 1:25:46.876
- I need to understand
how someone like you,

1:25:46.959 --> 1:25:49.876
who says he never hurt anyone--

1:25:49.959 --> 1:25:51.083
help me understand how you--

1:25:51.167 --> 1:25:53.500
how you turned into a murderer
that day.

1:25:53.584 --> 1:25:56.584
- [speaking Spanish]

1:25:58.584 --> 1:26:02.667
- I came to this country
owing $13,500.

1:26:07.584 --> 1:26:11.209
My mom put my--
put her house in the bank

1:26:11.292 --> 1:26:12.876
so that I could have money.

1:26:18.709 --> 1:26:22.083
I was looking to find
how am I gonna send the money.

1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:27.375
I started working
in apartments.

1:26:35.167 --> 1:26:38.000
And one day, I saw someone
come out of the apartments.

1:26:41.667 --> 1:26:44.667
And I said to myself, "I'm
gonna go in to look for money."

1:26:44.751 --> 1:26:48.751
- So you were looking

1:26:48.834 --> 1:26:52.959
to rob apartments that day?

1:26:53.042 --> 1:26:56.083
- [speaking Spanish]

1:26:57.417 --> 1:26:59.083
- I had been doing it
for a while,

1:26:59.167 --> 1:27:01.626
since I started needing money.

1:27:03.792 --> 1:27:05.918
Nothing ever happened--
- In that building or anywhere?

1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:09.292
- [speaking Spanish]
- Everywhere.

1:27:09.375 --> 1:27:11.918
Wherever they put me to work.

1:27:15.542 --> 1:27:18.792
That day, they sent me
to work where she lived--

1:27:18.876 --> 1:27:20.834
where your wife lived.

1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:28.000
So when I put my ear
to the door, the door opened.

1:27:33.167 --> 1:27:34.709
I was afraid
that I was gonna get caught,

1:27:34.792 --> 1:27:36.167
but then I saw a bag.

1:27:39.918 --> 1:27:42.459
When I took out the money,
I put the bag back in.

1:27:47.250 --> 1:27:51.375
And that's when the lady
came out and she ran after me.

1:27:55.375 --> 1:27:57.042
And when she started yelling
at me...

1:28:00.334 --> 1:28:03.876
The only word that I heard
that she said was "police."

1:28:09.209 --> 1:28:10.584
She went to grab the phone.

1:28:14.584 --> 1:28:16.417
I got behind her
and covered her mouth

1:28:16.500 --> 1:28:18.334
and told her not
to call the police.

1:28:21.292 --> 1:28:24.334
I lost my mind.
I lost it.

1:28:27.417 --> 1:28:29.375
And I was choking her
with my hand.

1:28:32.584 --> 1:28:34.751
At the same time,
I was covering her mouth...

1:28:36.459 --> 1:28:38.000
So that she wouldn't
make noise.

1:28:40.876 --> 1:28:43.042
I took my hand off,

1:28:43.125 --> 1:28:44.500
and I let her go.

1:28:45.918 --> 1:28:47.417
And I saw her--

1:28:48.918 --> 1:28:50.417
That her--

1:28:50.500 --> 1:28:52.334
her lips were blue.

1:28:54.417 --> 1:28:56.417
Then I thought,
"Oh, I killed her."

1:28:59.417 --> 1:29:01.584
And I took her to the bathroom.

1:29:05.209 --> 1:29:08.167
And then I hung her
like if she committed suicide.

1:29:08.250 --> 1:29:10.542
- Did you think you got--
you got away with it?

1:29:10.626 --> 1:29:13.334
- [speaking Spanish]
- Yes.

1:29:14.834 --> 1:29:17.125
- I want to show you
some pictures.

1:29:19.500 --> 1:29:21.042
You took a wife.

1:29:23.209 --> 1:29:25.834
You took someone
who I was madly in love with.

1:29:27.792 --> 1:29:30.167
You took a mother.

1:29:30.250 --> 1:29:32.918
That's my daughter
with her mom.

1:29:33.000 --> 1:29:35.417
They don't have anything
anymore.

1:29:37.000 --> 1:29:39.042
And they had everything.

1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:46.125
That was taken October 31st.

1:29:46.209 --> 1:29:48.250
That was the day
before you killed her.

1:29:52.542 --> 1:29:54.459
Adrienne missed a lot.

1:29:54.542 --> 1:29:56.459
She missed birthdays.

1:29:56.542 --> 1:30:00.459
That's the first birthday
after her mom left her.

1:30:00.542 --> 1:30:03.542
This is a recent birthday,
still no mom.

1:30:05.500 --> 1:30:07.959
This is what she was
left with--me.

1:30:08.042 --> 1:30:10.375
Just me.

1:30:11.667 --> 1:30:15.083
First day she rode a bike.
Her mom wasn't there for that.

1:30:15.167 --> 1:30:17.751
First days of school.

1:30:17.834 --> 1:30:20.083
Mommy wasn't there for that.

1:30:20.167 --> 1:30:22.834
She's a damn good
soccer player.

1:30:22.918 --> 1:30:26.167
Mommy's never seen
any of her games.

1:30:26.250 --> 1:30:29.626
This is--
this is the life you took away.

1:30:38.209 --> 1:30:41.125
[somber music]

1:30:46.584 --> 1:30:48.209
Okay.
I'm done.

1:30:50.417 --> 1:30:54.459
- [speaking Spanish]
- I'm sorry.

1:30:54.542 --> 1:30:56.125
- Stand up.

1:31:20.125 --> 1:31:21.667
[door slams]

1:31:28.292 --> 1:31:30.500
- I remember being very young,

1:31:30.584 --> 1:31:34.083
and I just wanted
to know exactly what happened.

1:31:36.250 --> 1:31:38.417
- What did Mommy look like
when you found her?

1:31:38.500 --> 1:31:40.209
- She looked bad.

1:31:40.292 --> 1:31:42.667
- Where was she?
- In the bathroom.

1:31:42.751 --> 1:31:44.334
- How did he kill her?
- He strangled her

1:31:44.417 --> 1:31:45.500
and put a rope
around her neck

1:31:45.584 --> 1:31:47.417
so it'd look
like she killed herself.

1:31:47.500 --> 1:31:49.918
But no one believed that.
She loved you so much

1:31:50.000 --> 1:31:51.250
and would never
have left you.

1:31:51.334 --> 1:31:53.792
- I bet it was scary.
- It was.

1:31:53.876 --> 1:31:55.959
- What did you tell me
when she died?

1:31:56.042 --> 1:31:57.292
- I told you
her body stopped working

1:31:57.375 --> 1:31:58.626
and she wasn't coming home.

1:31:58.709 --> 1:32:00.083
- Did I know
what dying meant?

1:32:00.167 --> 1:32:02.417
- No.
- That was good, right?

1:32:02.500 --> 1:32:04.834
- Yeah.
You were so little.

1:32:08.459 --> 1:32:11.542
- How often do I think
about him in my life?

1:32:11.626 --> 1:32:13.000
Every day.

1:32:13.083 --> 1:32:16.083
Whenever I think of her,
I think of him.

1:32:16.167 --> 1:32:19.709
But it's also different,
because I'm grieving her

1:32:19.792 --> 1:32:21.334
in a different way

1:32:21.417 --> 1:32:23.459
and more so kind of.

1:32:24.834 --> 1:32:27.709
both: One, two, three.

1:32:27.792 --> 1:32:31.125
- She's entering an age where,
you know,

1:32:31.209 --> 1:32:34.626
nobody can take the place
of a mother,

1:32:34.709 --> 1:32:39.292
and I'm sure she...
wishes she were here

1:32:39.375 --> 1:32:43.834
and needs her
for so many different things.

1:32:43.918 --> 1:32:47.125
- If you could bring Mommy
back for one day tomorrow,

1:32:47.209 --> 1:32:49.292
what would you get up and do?

1:32:50.500 --> 1:32:52.250
- Um...

1:32:53.500 --> 1:32:54.792
Just walk around.

1:32:54.876 --> 1:32:56.042
- Mm-hmm.

1:32:57.125 --> 1:32:59.083
Would you guys talk a lot?
- Yeah.

1:32:59.167 --> 1:33:00.918
- What would you tell her?

1:33:12.584 --> 1:33:15.834
- I don't know.
Just whatever came to mind.

1:33:15.918 --> 1:33:18.459
'Cause I could, you know?
- Mm-hmm.

1:33:20.918 --> 1:33:25.167
I struggle with the concept
of closure.

1:33:25.250 --> 1:33:29.042
My life will always
be about grief.

1:33:29.125 --> 1:33:31.292
You know?
There will always be

1:33:31.375 --> 1:33:33.042
that ghost in the room.

1:33:33.125 --> 1:33:36.959
The love that I had at that
time, it didn't go anywhere.

1:33:37.042 --> 1:33:43.167
It just, like, froze.
Like, she is frozen in time.

1:33:43.250 --> 1:33:45.626
- Every morning, we talk.

1:33:45.709 --> 1:33:47.459
She helps me.

1:33:47.542 --> 1:33:48.792
I loved her.

1:33:48.876 --> 1:33:51.083
I loved her.

1:33:52.125 --> 1:33:55.667
I can't even
believe it sometimes.

1:33:55.751 --> 1:33:57.375
She's so alive.

1:33:57.459 --> 1:34:00.000
She was so alive, Andy.
She was so alive.

1:34:00.083 --> 1:34:02.000
- I think about her every day.

1:34:02.083 --> 1:34:04.709
I think about my girls' pain
in not knowing their aunt,

1:34:04.792 --> 1:34:06.876
Sophie's pain.

1:34:06.959 --> 1:34:11.792
- To me, her greatest joy
was that child.

1:34:14.042 --> 1:34:16.209
- She's a little wind-up toy.

1:34:16.292 --> 1:34:21.042
- So to watch Sophie grow
into this incredible woman

1:34:21.125 --> 1:34:25.083
is terribly painful.

1:34:25.167 --> 1:34:27.334
And beautiful, because she's
such an amazing kid

1:34:27.417 --> 1:34:29.167
and has so much
of Adrienne in her

1:34:29.250 --> 1:34:32.000
and all the mannerisms
and all the sweetness

1:34:32.083 --> 1:34:33.375
and the silliness

1:34:33.459 --> 1:34:35.792
and sense of humor
and all of that,

1:34:35.876 --> 1:34:38.709
but Adrienne not getting
to have that...

1:34:38.792 --> 1:34:40.250
- Mm-hmm.

1:34:40.334 --> 1:34:42.125
- Is worse than anything to me.

1:34:44.542 --> 1:34:47.125
- She was getting more
and more confident in her life

1:34:47.209 --> 1:34:49.959
as a mom, a wife,
and all that,

1:34:50.042 --> 1:34:52.834
but in her--
her creative life too,

1:34:52.918 --> 1:34:56.751
she had a very clear idea
where she wanted to go.

1:34:57.751 --> 1:35:00.042
- She craved
making great work.

1:35:00.125 --> 1:35:02.751
She craved
having her voice heard

1:35:02.834 --> 1:35:05.042
and her vision be out there.

1:35:05.792 --> 1:35:08.542
- You just--
with certain people, you know

1:35:08.626 --> 1:35:11.250
certain things are gonna happen
if they continue on.

1:35:12.584 --> 1:35:13.542
- Do you hear that?

1:35:13.626 --> 1:35:16.125
- With Adrienne,
it's always gonna be

1:35:16.209 --> 1:35:18.834
the what could've been,
what was.

1:35:24.209 --> 1:35:29.334
- I just have a very specific
kind of satisfaction

1:35:29.417 --> 1:35:32.500
when I walk around midtown
and see "Waitress"

1:35:32.584 --> 1:35:35.292
on a Broadway marquee.

1:35:35.375 --> 1:35:38.417
The majority of people that
are going to see that show

1:35:38.500 --> 1:35:42.125
every day come from all
different walks of life.

1:35:42.209 --> 1:35:44.167
They don't know her story.
They don't even know

1:35:44.250 --> 1:35:46.667
what the deal is
behind "Waitress."

1:35:46.751 --> 1:35:48.792
And judging it completely
on its own merits...

1:35:48.876 --> 1:35:50.542
- Well, sure.
- And having an incredible

1:35:50.626 --> 1:35:53.626
experience as an artist,

1:35:53.709 --> 1:35:57.000
that's the best
we can hope for.

1:35:57.083 --> 1:36:02.375
In that regard, what an
incredible thing she's done.

1:36:04.125 --> 1:36:08.792
- Creative desire.
Create life and celebrate life

1:36:08.876 --> 1:36:11.000
and contribute to the world.

1:36:11.083 --> 1:36:13.876
It's part of,
you know, being a woman.

1:36:13.959 --> 1:36:17.042
It's part of being
a human being, I think.

1:36:19.250 --> 1:36:20.417
- After we do
this interview,

1:36:20.500 --> 1:36:22.042
I'm just gonna give you
this tape, you know?

1:36:22.125 --> 1:36:26.125
And you can have it and, uh,
maybe, like, one day perhaps

1:36:26.209 --> 1:36:29.125
there's an off-chance that
your children might see it.

1:36:29.209 --> 1:36:32.167
- Mm, mm, mm!
Delicious baby.

1:36:32.250 --> 1:36:35.083
- What would you, if anything,
want them to know

1:36:35.167 --> 1:36:39.334
or understand about you
at this point in your life?

1:36:40.918 --> 1:36:43.375
- That I--you know, I--
I don't have them yet,

1:36:43.459 --> 1:36:48.042
but I...
I'm thinking of them.

1:36:48.125 --> 1:36:49.209
You know?

1:36:49.292 --> 1:36:53.459
I really want them
to have a good life.

1:37:00.042 --> 1:37:04.751
Yeah, their mother starred
in some movies and...

1:37:04.834 --> 1:37:08.167
was on magazine covers and...

1:37:08.250 --> 1:37:11.792
was admired by a few people,

1:37:11.876 --> 1:37:13.959
but, uh,

1:37:14.042 --> 1:37:18.918
none of that she considers
as important as they will be.

1:37:20.459 --> 1:37:22.250
- All right.
- All right, say bye-bye.

1:37:22.334 --> 1:37:24.083
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

1:37:24.167 --> 1:37:26.459
- All right, bye, camera.
- Say bye-bye.

1:37:26.542 --> 1:37:27.959
- Sophie, can you wave?

1:37:28.042 --> 1:37:29.375
Can you wave bye-bye
to the camera?

1:37:29.459 --> 1:37:32.083
- Wave bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

1:37:41.834 --> 1:37:44.709

1:39:35.959 --> 1:39:38.459
