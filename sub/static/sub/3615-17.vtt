WEBVTT

00:01.167 --> 00:03.042
(<i>giggling</i>)

00:06.083 --> 00:07.067
See, we finally

00:07.167 --> 00:09.609
found a place
where we can be alone.

00:09.709 --> 00:10.942
Yeah, this is perfect.
Now all we have to do

00:11.042 --> 00:14.526
is move all our stuff in here
and nobody will ever bother us.

00:14.626 --> 00:15.567
Yeah.

00:15.667 --> 00:16.370
(<i>knocking, door opens</i>)

00:16.379 --> 00:18.651
PHOEBE:
I'm not looking
at anything,

00:18.751 --> 00:20.067
and I do not see anything.

00:20.167 --> 00:20.900
No one's looking.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.899
No one's looking
at anything.

00:22.999 --> 00:24.484
I just need to get my gloss.

00:24.584 --> 00:24.899
Phoebe!

00:24.999 --> 00:27.567
I'm sorry, were you guys
in the middle of the...

00:27.667 --> 00:28.734
Ew!

00:28.834 --> 00:30.899
No... not yet.

00:30.999 --> 00:33.025
Phoebe, would you
just get out of here?

00:33.125 --> 00:33.900
I found it!

00:34.000 --> 00:34.899
Okay, I'm going now.

00:34.999 --> 00:36.899
Outta here, found the gloss.

00:36.999 --> 00:38.609
Watch out for the...
Ooh!

00:38.709 --> 00:39.776
Ow.

00:39.876 --> 00:42.459
I'm okay.

00:42.999 --> 00:43.899
(<i>door closes</i>)

00:43.999 --> 00:44.900
(<i>knocking</i>)

00:45.000 --> 00:46.484
Hey, you guys.

00:46.584 --> 00:48.401
Hey-ya, Prue.
Are you lost?

00:48.501 --> 00:50.150
Uh, no, but my keys are.

00:50.250 --> 00:51.150
Have you seen them?

00:51.250 --> 00:52.899
No. Have you seen
the way out?

00:52.999 --> 00:55.609
Uh... uh... I-I knocked,
didn't I?

00:55.709 --> 00:57.692
But you didn't wait
for an answer.

00:57.792 --> 00:59.150
Oh...

00:59.250 --> 01:00.150
Right.

01:00.250 --> 01:01.109
God, I'm really sorry.

01:01.209 --> 01:03.983
Look at me... look at me
leaving, I'm leaving.

01:04.083 --> 01:05.400
Yes.

01:05.501 --> 01:08.275
Well, we knew what
we're getting into.

01:08.375 --> 01:12.275
So maybe it's time
we get out of it.

01:12.375 --> 01:14.651
What do you mean?

01:14.751 --> 01:15.609
Okay.

01:15.709 --> 01:18.776
Once upon a time,
before we were witchy women,

01:18.876 --> 01:22.609
Prue and I shared this amazing
apartment in North Beach.

01:22.709 --> 01:23.899
But then when
Grams got sick,

01:23.999 --> 01:26.025
we decided to move back
to the manor for a while.

01:26.125 --> 01:27.609
And we gave up
the apartment to friends,

01:27.709 --> 01:30.734
and your wife was smart enough
to keep in touch with them.

01:30.834 --> 01:33.109
Should I be taking notes?

01:33.209 --> 01:34.484
They're moving out.

01:34.584 --> 01:35.818
They're moving out
and they will

01:35.918 --> 01:38.234
give us first shot
at taking over the lease.

01:38.334 --> 01:40.526
Whoa. Are... are
you sure we can?

01:40.626 --> 01:43.526
Well, the rent's
a little steep, but...

01:43.626 --> 01:45.899
No, no, no,
I mean the bigger
"are you sure we can?"

01:45.999 --> 01:47.899
I mean, you guys didn't
get your powers until

01:47.999 --> 01:48.859
you all moved back
in together.

01:48.959 --> 01:51.526
There might be
some supernatural
ramifications

01:51.626 --> 01:52.317
to living apart.

01:52.417 --> 01:55.859
Okay, but what about
the marital ramifications

01:55.959 --> 01:56.692
to living together?

01:56.792 --> 01:58.150
I mean, Leo,
everything we do

01:58.250 --> 02:00.609
is about navigating
our charmed lives.

02:00.709 --> 02:02.692
I mean when do we
get to concentrate

02:02.792 --> 02:03.567
on our married life?

02:03.667 --> 02:06.899
Maybe this apartment
falling into our laps
is a sign.

02:06.999 --> 02:09.899
A sign that it's time
to move out of the manor

02:09.999 --> 02:12.167
and in together.

02:15.667 --> 02:16.899
What do you think
the odds are

02:16.999 --> 02:20.542
of pulling this off
before the next demon attacks?

02:27.959 --> 02:33.899
(<i>slow chanting</i>):
Om-na-re-kay-do...

02:33.999 --> 02:36.401
Om...

02:36.501 --> 02:42.442
Om-na-re-kay-do...

02:42.542 --> 02:47.734
Om...

02:47.834 --> 02:52.526
Om-na-re-kay-do...

02:52.626 --> 02:54.275
(<i>meows</i>)
Oh!

02:54.375 --> 02:55.818
Shadow!

02:55.918 --> 02:57.899
You gave me a fright,
little one.

02:57.999 --> 03:00.899
You know better than
to interrupt me during ritual.

03:00.999 --> 03:02.192
(<i>clicks tongue</i>)

03:02.292 --> 03:04.776
Now go. Go.

03:04.876 --> 03:06.125
Go.

03:10.709 --> 03:13.734
(<i>clears throat</i>)

03:13.834 --> 03:19.900
Om-na-re-kay-do...

03:20.000 --> 03:21.192
Om-na...

03:21.292 --> 03:24.083
What on earth are you doing?!

03:26.167 --> 03:27.526
Shadow?

03:27.626 --> 03:28.900
(<i>hisses</i>)

03:29.000 --> 03:30.942
Don't do this.

03:31.042 --> 03:32.567
Please!

03:32.667 --> 03:34.818
No!

03:34.918 --> 03:38.999
(<i>gasps</i>)

03:59.584 --> 04:01.900
What's the matter?

04:02.000 --> 04:03.899
Cat got your tongue?

04:03.999 --> 04:05.818
(<i>screams</i>)

04:05.918 --> 04:07.442
(<i>thunder rumbles</i>)

04:07.542 --> 04:09.442
(<i>screaming</i>)

04:09.542 --> 04:11.709
(<i>thunder rumbles</i>)

05:04.876 --> 05:06.042
Flakes.

05:07.501 --> 05:08.899
(<i>groans</i>):
The Warriors.

05:08.999 --> 05:09.899
Pathetic defense.

05:09.999 --> 05:11.899
Somebody pass
the, uh...

05:11.999 --> 05:13.025
Yep. I got it.

05:13.125 --> 05:14.609
Hey, what time
does the Bart...

05:14.709 --> 05:15.609
Every 15 minutes on a Saturday.

05:15.709 --> 05:18.942
Oh, good, Mama needs
a new pair of shoes.

05:19.042 --> 05:20.818
I know, limited funds.

05:20.918 --> 05:23.899
I will limit my shopping
to just window, I promise.

05:23.999 --> 05:24.692
I will gladly

05:24.792 --> 05:27.317
trade somebody for
the opinion page.

05:27.417 --> 05:28.999
Leo and I are moving.

05:31.876 --> 05:35.609
Thinking of moving
out of the manor.

05:35.709 --> 05:37.859
Um...

05:37.959 --> 05:38.818
milk?

05:38.918 --> 05:40.359
Excuse me?

05:40.459 --> 05:42.150
PHOEBE:
Wait a minute.
Life altering plans

05:42.250 --> 05:44.942
cannot be squeezed in
between "pass the newspaper"

05:45.042 --> 05:45.899
and "who ate the Special K?"

05:45.999 --> 05:50.275
Okay, look, we all knew this
would happen sooner or later.

05:50.375 --> 05:52.109
It's just sooner.

05:52.209 --> 05:54.192
Well, actually
it's later because

05:54.292 --> 05:55.078
I've been married
for weeks

05:55.088 --> 05:56.776
and we're still living
in a bedroom

05:56.876 --> 05:59.567
with the wallpaper
I picked out when I was nine.

05:59.667 --> 06:00.037
Not to mention

06:00.047 --> 06:03.900
the bathroom sharing,
and the family breakfasts...

06:04.000 --> 06:05.609
And the whole
saving the world

06:05.709 --> 06:06.899
on a weekly basis thing.

06:06.999 --> 06:08.526
I mean, Piper,
we don't live here

06:08.626 --> 06:09.899
just for sentimental value,
all right.

06:09.999 --> 06:12.567
We live here because
we're the strongest here.

06:12.667 --> 06:13.567
Right, I know.

06:13.667 --> 06:14.609
Leo, a little assist?

06:14.709 --> 06:17.025
Uh, well, there
have been times

06:17.125 --> 06:17.899
when you've

06:17.999 --> 06:19.025
handled things
on your own.

06:19.125 --> 06:20.567
I mean, without Piper.

06:20.667 --> 06:22.275
Like when I went to Hawaii

06:22.375 --> 06:24.526
or when I went away with Leo,

06:24.626 --> 06:26.067
and everything was fine.

06:26.167 --> 06:27.900
Do I get to kick her first?

06:28.000 --> 06:28.734
Everything was

06:28.834 --> 06:29.651
not fine, Piper, all right?

06:29.751 --> 06:32.899
The Charmed gig is all about
being a trio, all right?

06:32.999 --> 06:33.818
Without you, it...

06:33.918 --> 06:35.150
Well, you'd still have her.

06:35.250 --> 06:37.125
We wouldn't
be moving far.

06:37.459 --> 06:39.900
PIPER:
Just far enough
so I could have

06:40.000 --> 06:40.900
my own life,

06:41.000 --> 06:42.317
<i>our</i> own life.

06:42.417 --> 06:44.484
We all knew
this would happen.

06:44.584 --> 06:45.567
I'm just the one

06:45.667 --> 06:47.109
that's saying it first.

06:47.209 --> 06:49.234
We can't live together forever.

06:49.334 --> 06:51.983
PRUE:
Right, and we also
cannot ignore

06:52.083 --> 06:52.899
the responsibility

06:52.999 --> 06:55.999
that we inherited
from our family.

06:56.542 --> 07:00.150
Well, you guys have to try
and understand.

07:00.250 --> 07:03.375
I have two families now.

07:03.999 --> 07:04.899
Besides, wasn't it you,

07:04.999 --> 07:07.484
Miss Phoebe,
who moved to New York

07:07.584 --> 07:08.234
three years ago?

07:08.334 --> 07:09.942
Uh, no, no, that doesn't count.

07:10.042 --> 07:11.859
That was before
the whole destiny

07:11.959 --> 07:13.067
thing kicked in.

07:13.167 --> 07:13.899
We didn't get our powers

07:13.999 --> 07:15.899
until six months
after Grams died.

07:15.999 --> 07:16.734
Speaking of,

07:16.834 --> 07:17.899
what do you think she would say

07:17.999 --> 07:20.401
if she knew you were
even considering this?

07:20.501 --> 07:21.818
Morons.

07:21.918 --> 07:23.109
Why does that pre-pubescent

07:23.209 --> 07:25.734
have to throw the paper
in the shrubbery?

07:25.834 --> 07:28.109
Roger seems to have forgotten
an entire forest

07:28.209 --> 07:28.899
of his family tree,

07:28.999 --> 07:31.192
so now the head count
for the ceremony

07:31.292 --> 07:32.067
is up to 180.

07:32.167 --> 07:34.526
I know.
PIPER:
Grams!

07:34.626 --> 07:36.776
The doctor was very clear

07:36.876 --> 07:40.359
when he said no caffeine!

07:40.459 --> 07:41.818
Here.

07:41.918 --> 07:42.900
Have some nice tea.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.900
No, that would just be
my sister yelling.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.442
It'll be a lot easier
when I move out.

07:47.542 --> 07:48.317
Grams?!

07:48.417 --> 07:49.899
Where's the paper?

07:49.999 --> 07:51.899
PRUE:
Can I call you back?

07:51.999 --> 07:53.484
Thank you.

07:53.584 --> 07:54.526
You know, I'm so glad

07:54.626 --> 07:55.734
to have the two of you

07:55.834 --> 07:57.109
in the same place.

07:57.209 --> 07:58.025
It's a rarity.

07:58.125 --> 07:59.609
Oh, listen, do me a favor.

07:59.709 --> 08:01.651
I just treated myself

08:01.751 --> 08:03.899
and bought... ta-dah!

08:03.999 --> 08:04.899
A great new camera,

08:04.999 --> 08:07.567
even though it's
last year's model.

08:07.667 --> 08:08.192
What is it, a '96?

08:08.292 --> 08:10.192
Well, I'd just like
to get a picture of, you know...

08:10.292 --> 08:13.317
Did you say you were moving out?

08:13.417 --> 08:13.899
Yes, I did.

08:13.999 --> 08:16.734
We can't all live here
with Grams forever.

08:16.834 --> 08:18.025
GRAMS:
Yeah, uh,

08:18.125 --> 08:20.150
maybe just a couple
of quick shots,

08:20.250 --> 08:21.109
you know, candids.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.359
Uh, when was this decided?

08:22.459 --> 08:23.734
PRUE:
Oh, I don't know.

08:23.834 --> 08:25.609
Probably when I was proposed to.

08:25.709 --> 08:26.899
(<i>scoffs</i>)

08:26.999 --> 08:29.275
Uh...

08:29.375 --> 08:30.526
maybe later.

08:30.626 --> 08:32.400
Grams.

08:32.501 --> 08:33.775
Please sit down.

08:33.876 --> 08:35.899
You only just got back
from the hospital.

08:35.999 --> 08:37.567
Okay, I'll take it easy.

08:37.667 --> 08:39.150
(<i>doorbell rings</i>)

08:39.250 --> 08:41.192
After I get that.

08:41.292 --> 08:43.626
Uh, wha...

08:50.999 --> 08:51.734
PHOEBE:
Oh, you guys

08:51.834 --> 08:53.818
all didn't have
to get out of bed

08:53.918 --> 08:54.651
for little old me.

08:54.751 --> 08:55.442
OFFICER:
Mrs. Halliwell?

08:55.542 --> 08:57.526
Can I hear what she did first

08:57.626 --> 08:58.899
before I answer that?

08:58.999 --> 09:00.484
She was caught
shoplifting.

09:00.584 --> 09:02.150
Oh, that is
so not true.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.401
I just forgot to pay

09:04.501 --> 09:04.983
for them, Grams.

09:05.083 --> 09:07.025
The store's not even
pressing charges.

09:07.125 --> 09:07.942
Phoebe...

09:08.042 --> 09:10.567
Oh, please don't sound
so disappointed.

09:10.667 --> 09:12.859
Look, you're
always talking about

09:12.959 --> 09:13.567
how we should

09:13.667 --> 09:15.899
spend more time
together, and...

09:15.999 --> 09:17.484
well...

09:17.584 --> 09:19.584
here we all are.

09:20.209 --> 09:23.459
Okay, that was
really fun.

09:24.292 --> 09:25.899
Phoebe.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.899
What is the
matter with you?

09:27.999 --> 09:30.609
How can you behave
so recklessly?

09:30.709 --> 09:32.899
What about your destiny?

09:32.999 --> 09:34.899
Your...

09:34.999 --> 09:36.667
Your future.

09:36.918 --> 09:39.192
Well, maybe my future plans
don't match up

09:39.292 --> 09:41.359
to the ones
that you've mapped out.

09:41.459 --> 09:42.899
(<i>officer clears throat</i>)

09:42.999 --> 09:44.899
We're, uh, gonna
need to take back

09:44.999 --> 09:45.900
those shoes that you...

09:46.000 --> 09:47.942
Forgot to pay for?

09:48.042 --> 09:48.983
Right.

09:49.083 --> 09:50.584
Mmm.

09:52.999 --> 09:57.150
They're just
out of my price range.

09:57.250 --> 09:58.275
But they're...

09:58.375 --> 10:00.459
Perfect. I know.

10:00.999 --> 10:02.150
And I'm sure all these

10:02.250 --> 10:03.999
will be perfect, too.

10:04.626 --> 10:06.734
(<i>laughs</i>)

10:06.834 --> 10:08.918
Oh.

10:10.459 --> 10:11.150
Okay, I'm weak.

10:11.250 --> 10:13.667
Can you show me
this one, too?

10:18.584 --> 10:19.275
Or not.

10:19.375 --> 10:21.734
Those are so last season.

10:21.834 --> 10:22.818
(<i>grunts</i>)

10:22.918 --> 10:24.250
(<i>screams</i>)

10:27.167 --> 10:28.042
(<i>grunts</i>)

10:31.834 --> 10:33.834
Whoa. Down, boy.

10:34.999 --> 10:36.484
(<i>grunts</i>)

10:36.584 --> 10:37.234
Whoa.

10:37.334 --> 10:38.651
Where'd you steal
that power from?

10:38.751 --> 10:40.359
That's for me to know
and you to find...

10:40.459 --> 10:42.584
(<i>Phoebe grunting</i>)

10:44.999 --> 10:47.250
I hear spikes
are making a comeback.

10:47.834 --> 10:49.250
(<i>grunts</i>)

10:50.876 --> 10:52.651
(<i>yells</i>)

10:52.751 --> 10:54.999
(<i>sighs</i>)

10:55.501 --> 10:57.899
I think we got too many boxes.

10:57.999 --> 10:58.899
No, we didn't.

10:58.999 --> 11:01.484
You only live
on this plane part time,

11:01.584 --> 11:02.275
and there is no way

11:02.375 --> 11:04.859
we need all these boxes
just for me.

11:04.959 --> 11:05.983
Yes, we do.

11:06.083 --> 11:08.692
Are you saying
I have too much stuff?

11:08.792 --> 11:09.899
Yes, I am.

11:09.999 --> 11:11.067
You do realize the only reason

11:11.167 --> 11:12.899
I'm letting you
get away with that,

11:12.999 --> 11:14.359
is because you're the only one

11:14.459 --> 11:15.734
on my team right now.

11:15.834 --> 11:16.162
Yes, I do.

11:16.172 --> 11:18.109
They just need some time
to get used to the idea.

11:18.209 --> 11:20.567
Well, moving out
is a big deal for me, too.

11:20.667 --> 11:21.899
I could use some support

11:21.999 --> 11:23.083
right now.

11:24.959 --> 11:26.250
(<i>screams</i>)

11:28.083 --> 11:30.359
(<i>screams</i>)

11:30.459 --> 11:33.459
Uh... Leo, help!

11:35.334 --> 11:36.899
Piper.

11:36.999 --> 11:39.067
What am I supposed
to do with this?

11:39.167 --> 11:39.776
No, no,

11:39.876 --> 11:41.334
way too messy, too violent!

11:43.292 --> 11:44.999
(<i>screams</i>)

11:46.542 --> 11:47.834
You okay?

11:48.501 --> 11:50.442
I'm fine... whatever.

11:50.542 --> 11:51.150
GRAMS:
Uh, okay, girls,

11:51.250 --> 11:54.317
now, if you could just
move a little closer, okay?

11:54.417 --> 11:56.275
Uh, Phoebe, uh,

11:56.375 --> 11:56.899
turn to me,

11:56.999 --> 11:58.275
I want to be able
to get your good side.

11:58.375 --> 12:00.526
I don't think
she has one today, Grams.

12:00.626 --> 12:02.776
Can we please get
this over with?

12:02.876 --> 12:04.234
Why, you got plans?

12:04.334 --> 12:05.150
GRAMS:
Prue, uh...

12:05.250 --> 12:07.150
all I'm getting is shoulder.

12:07.250 --> 12:09.317
With anyone that I know?

12:09.417 --> 12:12.651
I'm sure lying beneath
all this sarcasm,

12:12.751 --> 12:13.484
there is a point,

12:13.584 --> 12:15.899
and if it has anything
to do with Roger...

12:15.999 --> 12:16.899
Well, I mean he said

12:16.999 --> 12:18.192
that you called him yesterday.

12:18.292 --> 12:18.899
Looking for you.

12:18.999 --> 12:19.899
Prue, I'm not gonna

12:19.999 --> 12:20.942
defend myself,
when I didn't

12:21.042 --> 12:22.275
do anything wrong.
Really?

12:22.375 --> 12:24.442
Just trying to be nice
to the guy, considering

12:24.542 --> 12:26.526
he's gonna be part
of this family soon.

12:26.626 --> 12:27.983
You know, which,
I'm not even sure

12:28.083 --> 12:29.983
<i>I</i> want to be part
of this family.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.442
The sun is shifting.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.899
Could you move
down a step please?

12:33.999 --> 12:35.484
And why would
I waste my time

12:35.584 --> 12:37.899
on a wimp who's
got mother issues?

12:37.999 --> 12:38.899
PRUE:
I don't know,

12:38.999 --> 12:39.942
but why should I believe

12:40.042 --> 12:41.234
anything that you say?

12:41.334 --> 12:42.567
I mean, you don't even know
the difference

12:42.667 --> 12:43.692
between what belongs to you

12:43.792 --> 12:44.692
and what belongs to,

12:44.792 --> 12:45.651
oh, let's say Macy's.

12:45.751 --> 12:47.609
All righty then,
are we done?

12:47.709 --> 12:49.234
(<i>gasps</i>)

12:49.334 --> 12:50.900
Grams.
Grams.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.542
Okay, okay,
take shallow breaths.

12:55.417 --> 12:57.484
Should we call the doctor?

12:57.584 --> 12:59.109
No doctor.

12:59.209 --> 13:01.526
Just a picture.

13:01.626 --> 13:03.067
Is it too much
for an old lady

13:03.167 --> 13:04.526
to ask her
granddaughters

13:04.626 --> 13:06.484
to retract their claws,

13:06.584 --> 13:08.899
stand still,
and look at me

13:08.999 --> 13:13.667
long enough to take
one lousy picture?

13:14.250 --> 13:15.792
(<i>grunts</i>)

13:34.250 --> 13:34.651
Hi.

13:34.751 --> 13:36.899
What happened to the "window"
in your shopping?

13:36.999 --> 13:38.442
Turns out these
are a write-off.

13:38.542 --> 13:39.818
Who knew Prada's
spring line

13:39.918 --> 13:41.234
could be used
to fight evil?

13:41.334 --> 13:42.442
I killed a...
Warlock.

13:42.542 --> 13:44.484
Appeared out of nowhere,
had to kill him.

13:44.584 --> 13:45.401
Wait, you too?

13:45.501 --> 13:46.275
Uh, me three.

13:46.375 --> 13:47.859
Warlock attacked me
in the attic.

13:47.959 --> 13:49.359
Did we miss a convention?

13:49.459 --> 13:50.899
Well, if so,
I got the runt.

13:50.999 --> 13:52.776
Bad teeth,
funky clothes,

13:52.876 --> 13:54.401
and way too
easy to kill.

13:54.501 --> 13:55.734
Black hair?

13:55.834 --> 13:56.567
Bad breath?

13:56.667 --> 13:58.109
You know him?

13:58.209 --> 13:58.942
Uh, I think

13:59.042 --> 13:59.818
I killed him.

13:59.918 --> 14:01.526
Care to try again?

14:01.626 --> 14:02.876
(<i>gasps</i>)

14:07.542 --> 14:08.959
(<i>gasping</i>)

14:12.999 --> 14:13.999
(<i>screams</i>)

14:15.626 --> 14:17.776
Oh.

14:17.876 --> 14:19.401
(<i>both grunting</i>)

14:19.501 --> 14:20.442
PHOEBE:
Okay.

14:20.542 --> 14:21.025
So that does it.

14:21.125 --> 14:22.899
Again.
Okay, does
anyone else

14:22.999 --> 14:23.899
think that was weird,

14:23.999 --> 14:25.317
like he wasn't even trying?

14:25.417 --> 14:27.734
Almost as if
he wasn't even interested.

14:27.834 --> 14:29.859
What do you think he was up to?

14:29.959 --> 14:31.275
Or is up to.

14:31.375 --> 14:33.317
How do we know he's really gone?

14:33.417 --> 14:34.899
We don't.

14:34.999 --> 14:35.899
But we all have

14:35.999 --> 14:37.484
vanquished
him once today.

14:37.584 --> 14:37.983
And?

14:38.083 --> 14:40.792
Well, what if he
can't be vanquished?

14:45.542 --> 14:48.942
âª I've been
working on a vanquish âª

14:49.042 --> 14:50.899
âª All the live... âª

14:50.999 --> 14:52.167
Whoa.

14:52.999 --> 14:53.859
Okay.

14:53.959 --> 14:54.899
Thanks, Grams.

14:54.999 --> 14:57.899
It's so weird that we
listen to her more now

14:57.999 --> 14:58.900
than when
she was alive.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.359
"How to perform
a sÃ©ance,

15:00.459 --> 15:02.067
a ceremony to contact the dead."

15:02.167 --> 15:03.609
PIPER:
But the guy we're
dealing with

15:03.709 --> 15:05.526
won't die,
so that's not gonna help.

15:05.626 --> 15:07.692
Yeah, I don't know,
Grams must be very,

15:07.792 --> 15:09.234
very, very confused.

15:09.334 --> 15:10.899
(<i>yelping</i>)

15:10.999 --> 15:12.899
And very testy also.
Hmm.

15:12.999 --> 15:16.899
Okay, we're gonna need six
candles, white and purple,

15:16.999 --> 15:17.983
some burning
cinnamon,

15:18.083 --> 15:19.067
frankincense
and sandalwood.

15:19.167 --> 15:21.876
Piper, you want to grab
the white cloth?

15:23.999 --> 15:24.651
You know, this trunk

15:24.751 --> 15:27.317
would go great
at the foot of our bed.

15:27.417 --> 15:29.899
Yeah, and my foot would
look great on your butt.

15:29.999 --> 15:30.899
You are so not

15:30.999 --> 15:31.942
taking that, okay?

15:32.042 --> 15:34.109
It holds
all of our ritual stuff.

15:34.209 --> 15:38.899
I just want things
to remember this place by.

15:38.999 --> 15:39.651
How 'bout this?

15:39.751 --> 15:42.734
Something to bring a piece
of Grams to my place.

15:42.834 --> 15:43.317
Okay, sweetie.

15:43.417 --> 15:46.626
Hey, can we try
and contact the dead
now please?

15:48.999 --> 15:50.484
ALL:
Beloved unknown spirit,

15:50.584 --> 15:51.442
we seek your guidance.

15:51.542 --> 15:54.734
we ask you to commune
with us and move among us.

15:54.834 --> 15:58.651
Beloved unknown spirit,
we seek your guidance.

15:58.751 --> 16:01.542
We ask that
you commune with us...

16:02.792 --> 16:04.067
Forgive me,

16:04.167 --> 16:05.109
but why...?

16:05.209 --> 16:06.234
PHOEBE:
Uh, we don't know.

16:06.334 --> 16:08.899
But we were told in
a roundabout sort of way

16:08.999 --> 16:11.109
that you might
be able to help us.

16:11.209 --> 16:13.818
Are you... witches?

16:13.918 --> 16:16.317
You're the three
sister witches,

16:16.417 --> 16:18.317
the Charmed Ones, aren't you?

16:18.417 --> 16:20.234
And you're a witch, too?

16:20.334 --> 16:24.192
I... I was.

16:24.292 --> 16:25.275
I'm sorry.

16:25.375 --> 16:26.567
This is...

16:26.667 --> 16:27.192
so new.

16:27.292 --> 16:30.942
I haven't exactly
figured it all out yet.

16:31.042 --> 16:32.776
PRUE:
We think that we're

16:32.876 --> 16:34.899
up against an evil
that can't be killed.

16:34.999 --> 16:36.234
We've nixed him
four times, but...

16:36.334 --> 16:39.025
And since you're the only one
that answered our call...

16:39.125 --> 16:42.899
The spirits must think
I know who you're up against.

16:42.999 --> 16:43.959
Right.

16:44.209 --> 16:46.734
You say you've
killed him four times?

16:46.834 --> 16:50.067
Yeah, and it's like he just
keeps on coming back for more.

16:50.167 --> 16:51.192
It's like he...

16:51.292 --> 16:53.125
Wants to die.

16:53.501 --> 16:54.899
Do you know who he is?

16:54.999 --> 16:58.109
He was my familiar.

16:58.209 --> 17:01.484
A feline I called Shadow.

17:01.584 --> 17:02.900
He's a warlock now,

17:03.000 --> 17:05.651
what a familiar becomes
when he betrays his witch.

17:05.751 --> 17:09.401
That must be why we can't kill
him, the whole nine lives thing.

17:09.501 --> 17:13.898
So if we kill him five more
times he should be gonzo, right?

17:13.999 --> 17:15.900
WOMAN:
No, that's exactly
what you can't do.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.898
You see, once a familiar
becomes a warlock,

17:18.999 --> 17:20.898
it has until the next new moon

17:20.999 --> 17:22.776
to purge itself
of it's old life.

17:22.876 --> 17:25.442
If it succeeds,
it becomes immortal.

17:25.541 --> 17:31.025
If it fails, it returns to its
animal state for eternity.

17:31.125 --> 17:32.899
Shadow was a cat,

17:32.999 --> 17:37.150
so it has to shed all
nine of its familiar lives.

17:37.250 --> 17:37.983
So why bother us?

17:38.083 --> 17:40.109
Why not just jump
in front of nine buses?

17:40.209 --> 17:43.109
Because we're the only ones
strong enough to kill him.

17:43.209 --> 17:45.067
And he knew
where to find us.

17:45.167 --> 17:45.899
What are we, like,

17:45.999 --> 17:47.651
in the warlock's guide
to San Francisco?

17:47.751 --> 17:49.776
PHOEBE:
Okay, so this should be
a piece of cake.

17:49.876 --> 17:52.899
All we have to do is make sure
we <i>don't</i> kill this guy

17:52.999 --> 17:55.275
five more times
before the next new moon.

17:55.375 --> 17:57.109
That's two days, no problem.

17:57.209 --> 17:59.899
PRUE:
I'm sorry, this just
seems so callous.

17:59.999 --> 18:04.109
I mean, you just lost your life,
and we're treating you like 411.

18:04.209 --> 18:05.776
It's okay.

18:05.876 --> 18:07.651
I just...

18:07.751 --> 18:09.899
I'm at peace now,

18:09.999 --> 18:11.899
with the ones I loved...

18:11.999 --> 18:15.359
When someone
is taken from you suddenly,

18:15.459 --> 18:18.651
there are no good-byes.

18:18.751 --> 18:21.899
Something we're all
too familiar with.

18:21.999 --> 18:23.942
At its core,

18:24.042 --> 18:26.899
evil exists for one reason--

18:26.999 --> 18:29.192
to spread loss.

18:29.292 --> 18:32.626
Be careful
not to lose each other.

18:34.834 --> 18:36.567
Take care.

18:36.667 --> 18:39.542
And blessed be.

18:53.375 --> 18:56.651
Damn wind keeps
blowing out my candles.

18:56.751 --> 18:59.484
I'm sorry, Patty.
I got cut off.

18:59.584 --> 19:02.209
Oh, now...

19:05.250 --> 19:07.899
It's just what troubles
me about your daughters

19:07.999 --> 19:10.942
is not where they came from,
it's where they're going.

19:11.042 --> 19:12.859
It's just a phase.

19:12.959 --> 19:14.776
When their destiny
is revealed,

19:14.876 --> 19:16.776
they'll come together.

19:16.876 --> 19:17.983
But what if they don't?

19:18.083 --> 19:19.734
What if they never do?

19:19.834 --> 19:20.609
And what if
the gift

19:20.709 --> 19:23.834
is too much for them
to handle and they...

19:26.083 --> 19:28.983
Well, regardless...

19:29.083 --> 19:30.899
I fear there may be
only one option,

19:30.999 --> 19:34.942
if I can't find a way to bring
these girls together.

19:35.042 --> 19:36.899
Mother, that's nonsense.

19:36.999 --> 19:40.109
Perhaps.

19:40.209 --> 19:42.501
Good night, my darling.

19:44.999 --> 19:48.709
PHOEBE:
Hey, who turned out the lights?

19:51.292 --> 19:53.792
(<i>grunting</i>)

20:10.292 --> 20:11.859
Uh-oh!

20:11.959 --> 20:13.442
What happened?

20:13.542 --> 20:16.359
I think I killed
the warlock again.

20:16.459 --> 20:17.651
Oh, Phoebe!

20:17.751 --> 20:18.317
Phoebe!

20:18.417 --> 20:19.776
Well, I didn't mean to.

20:19.876 --> 20:20.609
It was a gut reaction.

20:20.709 --> 20:23.899
You know, self-preservation
and stuff.

20:23.999 --> 20:27.484
Hmm, you know...

20:27.584 --> 20:28.204
I've been thinking.

20:28.214 --> 20:30.776
I'm pretty sure he won't
actually hurt us.

20:30.876 --> 20:31.651
I mean, he needs us.

20:31.751 --> 20:34.609
So let's just say that
he knocks one of us off.

20:34.709 --> 20:36.401
Then the power
of three would be broken

20:36.501 --> 20:38.234
and we wouldn't have
the strength to kill him.

20:38.334 --> 20:40.899
PHOEBE:
And then he takes
a permanent catnap.

20:40.999 --> 20:43.192
But we're assuming that he's
smart enough to know this.

20:43.292 --> 20:44.234
I mean,
what if he isn't?

20:44.334 --> 20:45.776
You know, what if
he doesn't know

20:45.876 --> 20:46.662
that he shouldn't
kill us

20:46.672 --> 20:48.317
and we just sit there
and watch it happen?

20:48.417 --> 20:49.900
Yeah, but what other
choice do we have?

20:50.000 --> 20:52.359
I mean we kill him
four more times, he wins,

20:52.459 --> 20:54.983
becomes more powerful
than we can handle.

20:55.083 --> 20:56.609
Either way we lose.

20:56.709 --> 20:58.651
I vote for not losing at all.

20:58.751 --> 21:00.334
Mm...

21:03.209 --> 21:03.983
Wow.

21:04.083 --> 21:04.899
Uh, yeah, sorry.

21:04.999 --> 21:07.776
I'll get all this stuff
out of the way soon as...

21:07.876 --> 21:09.651
You're gonna
really do this, huh?

21:09.751 --> 21:11.734
Yeah.

21:11.834 --> 21:12.983
You know,

21:13.083 --> 21:14.484
we have lived apart before.

21:14.584 --> 21:18.818
Our lives were apart,
Piper, it's different now.

21:18.918 --> 21:21.567
I just think that we need
to talk this through.

21:21.667 --> 21:23.234
That way we all know
exactly what

21:23.334 --> 21:25.734
the consequences are,
for all of us.

21:25.834 --> 21:26.859
(<i>meows</i>)

21:26.959 --> 21:28.275
Ooh, saved by the meow.

21:28.375 --> 21:29.900
You know, I don't
think I'm ever gonna

21:30.000 --> 21:32.317
be able to look at Kit
quite the same way.

21:32.417 --> 21:36.083
Or get undressed in front
of him for that matter.

21:36.709 --> 21:39.899
You guys are right.
We should talk this through.

21:39.999 --> 21:43.918
(<i>meowing</i>)

21:48.417 --> 21:49.442
(<i>meowing</i>)

21:49.542 --> 21:53.067
Oh, why does this stupid cat
keep hanging around?

21:53.167 --> 21:54.899
Who do you belong to?

21:54.999 --> 21:56.234
Go home.

21:56.334 --> 21:57.899
Shoo! Shoo!

21:57.999 --> 22:00.526
(<i>sighs</i>)

22:00.626 --> 22:02.401
What did you want
to talk about?

22:02.501 --> 22:04.818
Oh, uh, let's just
go for a walk.

22:04.918 --> 22:05.818
Hi, kitty.

22:05.918 --> 22:08.983
So there's just
a little detail
about the wedding

22:09.083 --> 22:11.401
that hasn't been
worked out yet.
Prue...

22:11.501 --> 22:12.899
Just listen to me, okay?

22:12.999 --> 22:16.526
I want you to be
my maid of honor.

22:16.626 --> 22:17.526
Me?

22:17.626 --> 22:19.025
PRUE:
I mean,
it's not like

22:19.125 --> 22:20.900
I would actually
ask Phoebe.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.150
So I win by default?

22:22.250 --> 22:24.983
Wow, Prue, you really know
how to flatter a girl.

22:25.083 --> 22:26.442
Piper, can you
just give me

22:26.542 --> 22:27.900
the tiniest of
breaks here, okay?

22:28.000 --> 22:29.401
This is not how
I ever thought

22:29.501 --> 22:31.067
that this whole thing
would happen, okay?

22:31.167 --> 22:34.359
Oh, my God, I would love
for both of my sisters

22:34.459 --> 22:35.609
to be my best friend,

22:35.709 --> 22:37.651
but clearly that
is not the case.

22:37.751 --> 22:39.899
Maybe one day things
will change, but...

22:39.999 --> 22:42.067
Oh, it's gonna take
more than time.

22:42.167 --> 22:43.983
I mean, I'm happy for you,
I am,

22:44.083 --> 22:46.484
and I know you have
all these big plans,

22:46.584 --> 22:47.734
but what about the rest of us?

22:47.834 --> 22:50.692
I mean, you move in with Roger,
and then I'm stuck here

22:50.792 --> 22:54.150
alone taking care of Grams
and Phoebe's out of control.

22:54.250 --> 22:56.192
What if, what if
there's an emergency?

22:56.292 --> 22:57.150
What if something happens?

22:57.250 --> 22:58.899
Okay, I won't
be far away.

22:58.999 --> 22:59.983
It's not like
you guys

23:00.083 --> 23:02.025
won't be able to get
a hold of me.

23:02.125 --> 23:03.942
I just think we should
talk this through

23:04.042 --> 23:05.317
so we know
what the consequences are.

23:05.417 --> 23:09.484
Okay, look, maybe a part of me
is jealous because, you know,

23:09.584 --> 23:10.329
you've got this great guy

23:10.339 --> 23:12.192
and you're gonna have
this beautiful wedding,

23:12.292 --> 23:14.109
and I'm just not
very good with guys.

23:14.209 --> 23:16.567
Sometimes I think I'll
never find true love.

23:16.667 --> 23:18.067
Piper, that...
But...

23:18.167 --> 23:18.899
Oh! Sorry.

23:18.999 --> 23:22.417
No, it's my fault. Sorry.

23:31.751 --> 23:33.442
You know, just because
I'm moving out

23:33.542 --> 23:35.192
doesn't mean we
still can't do this.

23:35.292 --> 23:36.109
What, mainline
caffeine

23:36.209 --> 23:38.484
while waxing
on warlock issues?

23:38.584 --> 23:39.567
No, hang out.

23:39.667 --> 23:42.442
You know, I don't want
to be one of those

23:42.542 --> 23:43.120
old married lepers

23:43.130 --> 23:44.899
that nobody thinks
is fun any more.

23:44.999 --> 23:47.025
You've never been fun, Piper.

23:47.125 --> 23:48.442
I've always been fun, Prue.

23:48.542 --> 23:50.692
I am just Mrs. Fun now.

23:50.792 --> 23:51.859
Oh, Mrs. Fun.

23:51.959 --> 23:52.983
You know,
the life changes

23:53.083 --> 23:54.484
from the move
will work itself out.

23:54.584 --> 23:57.317
It's the supernatural ones
that we're concerned about.

23:57.417 --> 23:59.109
But we get attacked separately
all the time,

23:59.209 --> 24:03.900
like yesterday, and we just came
together and sorted it out then.

24:04.000 --> 24:04.899
WARLOCK:
You know,

24:04.999 --> 24:05.899
you girls
are getting

24:05.999 --> 24:07.025
harder and harder
to find.

24:07.125 --> 24:10.900
I was beginning to think you
were trying to avoid me.

24:11.000 --> 24:11.942
Wow, you've
been thinking.

24:12.042 --> 24:14.792
That's pretty big step
for a warlock.

24:15.167 --> 24:16.818
Oh, God, I am so sorry.

24:16.918 --> 24:19.067
That was awfully...
<i>catty</i> of me, wasn't it?

24:19.167 --> 24:21.899
Is this the part
where I'm supposed to go,

24:21.999 --> 24:24.899
"Ooh, they did research"
and run away?

24:24.999 --> 24:26.067
Might be a good idea.

24:26.167 --> 24:29.275
Or what, you'll kill me?

24:29.375 --> 24:30.192
PIPER:
No.

24:30.292 --> 24:31.734
Actually we'll do worse.

24:31.834 --> 24:33.234
We won't touch you.

24:33.334 --> 24:33.942
Look at that.

24:34.042 --> 24:37.067
Witches think they have
this one figured out.

24:37.167 --> 24:38.776
Well, let me tell
you all something.

24:38.876 --> 24:40.859
(<i>gasping</i>)

24:40.959 --> 24:42.317
Don't dance
if you don't know

24:42.417 --> 24:43.042
the steps.

24:46.125 --> 24:47.899
(<i>grunts</i>)

24:47.999 --> 24:50.083
Oh, my God!

24:50.792 --> 24:52.709
Call 911!

25:02.250 --> 25:03.734
That girl.

25:03.834 --> 25:05.734
There's just
no reason.

25:05.834 --> 25:06.899
I got used to there being

25:06.999 --> 25:09.899
a reason, you know,
an explanation,

25:09.999 --> 25:11.067
but she didn't even... .

25:11.167 --> 25:11.942
PRUE:
Stand a chance,

25:12.042 --> 25:13.942
but there <i>was</i> a
reason, Pheebs.

25:14.042 --> 25:15.317
He was sending a message.

25:15.417 --> 25:16.899
Yeah, and we got it
loud and clear,

25:16.999 --> 25:20.899
but there's nothing we can do
that we haven't already done.

25:20.999 --> 25:24.526
So what, he just keeps
killing until we kill him?

25:24.626 --> 25:27.609
Which is exactly
what he wants.

25:27.709 --> 25:30.192
Exactly what
we can't do.

25:30.292 --> 25:32.442
Uh... is that a potion?

25:32.542 --> 25:34.900
I wouldn't know
where to begin.

25:35.000 --> 25:35.899
Just keeping my hands busy.

25:35.999 --> 25:37.899
It's something
Grams taught me, actually--

25:37.999 --> 25:42.234
to improvise, but all
I've come up with is...

25:42.334 --> 25:43.734
mud.

25:43.834 --> 25:45.150
So how do we kill a warlock

25:45.250 --> 25:46.942
who we know
we shouldn't be killing?

25:47.042 --> 25:51.709
Well, we've only got three more
chances to figure that out.

25:56.918 --> 25:58.734
PIPER:
I am going
to finish the brownies

25:58.834 --> 26:00.484
and don't even try
and stop me.

26:00.584 --> 26:03.899
Well, I'm afraid Prue
has beaten you to it,

26:03.999 --> 26:05.109
but I've got a backup.

26:05.209 --> 26:08.067
What do you say we
whip up your favorite

26:08.167 --> 26:09.899
double-chocolate
decadence cake?

26:09.999 --> 26:14.542
Isn't "decadence" French for
"don't even think about it"?

26:14.999 --> 26:15.818
What are you making?

26:15.918 --> 26:20.025
Oh, just keeping
my hands busy.

26:20.125 --> 26:20.484
Oh. Phoebe.

26:20.584 --> 26:22.651
Piper and I were
just thinking

26:22.751 --> 26:24.192
of whipping up something

26:24.292 --> 26:25.899
we'll all regret tomorrow.

26:25.999 --> 26:27.999
Care to join us?

26:30.999 --> 26:32.526
Where are you headed?

26:32.626 --> 26:33.999
Out.

26:39.000 --> 26:39.942
On second thought...

26:40.042 --> 26:40.900
(<i>door closes</i>)

26:41.000 --> 26:42.999
...do you need a hand?

26:52.292 --> 26:53.025
What?

26:53.125 --> 26:54.899
How do you know what to add?

26:54.999 --> 26:57.899
Well, you needed
to balance the mustard seed,

26:57.999 --> 26:59.899
which can be kinda
harsh, and the sea salt

26:59.999 --> 27:02.876
brings out
the flavor of the, um...

27:03.876 --> 27:04.899
Grams.

27:04.999 --> 27:08.526
Piper. You were born for this.

27:08.626 --> 27:09.317
Literally.

27:09.417 --> 27:11.109
Why do you insist
on wasting

27:11.209 --> 27:13.109
your talents behind some
counter at a bank?

27:13.209 --> 27:17.899
Because my talents don't come
with health benefits, Grams.

27:17.999 --> 27:19.275
Prue's getting married

27:19.375 --> 27:21.899
and Phoebe's... well Phoebe.

27:21.999 --> 27:23.942
You know,
somebody has to be practical.

27:24.042 --> 27:26.275
Not at the expense
of her dreams.

27:26.375 --> 27:29.442
No, at the expense
of losing this house

27:29.542 --> 27:33.334
and not being able
to pay your hospital bills.

27:33.999 --> 27:37.899
I'm sorry if
I'm disappointing you.

27:37.999 --> 27:38.609
Oh...

27:38.709 --> 27:42.899
You could never do that.

27:42.999 --> 27:47.275
I'm just...
doing what I have to do.

27:47.375 --> 27:48.709
It's okay.

27:55.584 --> 27:56.999
So am I.

28:15.918 --> 28:18.818
My sweet girls.

28:18.918 --> 28:20.542
You're just not ready.

28:23.584 --> 28:26.317
I've got to stop you
from becoming...

28:26.417 --> 28:29.709
The Charmed Ones.

28:29.999 --> 28:32.776
What does a fellow have to do
to get killed around here?

28:32.876 --> 28:33.899
Not gonna happen.

28:33.999 --> 28:35.025
WARLOCK:
Oh.

28:35.125 --> 28:37.692
I could, uh...

28:37.792 --> 28:39.999
sever a head.

28:40.250 --> 28:41.067
Only take a second.

28:41.167 --> 28:43.083
Don't even think about it.

28:43.459 --> 28:44.109
Wait a minute, that's it.

28:44.209 --> 28:46.401
I'll just keep freezing him
until midnight.

28:46.501 --> 28:47.734
And new moon means

28:47.834 --> 28:50.375
bye-bye bad guy, right?

28:53.667 --> 28:55.692
Oh, I'm just going to keep

28:55.792 --> 28:57.899
getting better
and better at this.

28:57.999 --> 28:58.899
(<i>crackling</i>)

28:58.999 --> 29:00.692
(<i>grunts</i>)

29:00.792 --> 29:01.734
Oh, it was a thought.

29:01.834 --> 29:05.918
WARLOCK:
Come on, time's wasting.

29:06.999 --> 29:09.192
You know I'm just
going to keep on killing.

29:09.292 --> 29:11.776
And the next one
won't go so fast.

29:11.876 --> 29:14.025
The next one, I'll savor.

29:14.125 --> 29:16.150
You telling me
all you're gonna do

29:16.250 --> 29:18.125
is stand back and watch?

29:19.501 --> 29:21.109
How many more people
have to die

29:21.209 --> 29:22.899
before you do what I ask?

29:22.999 --> 29:24.025
None.

29:24.125 --> 29:27.834
(<i>yelling</i>)

29:28.459 --> 29:29.275
(<i>sighs</i>)

29:29.375 --> 29:31.609
I-I'm sorry, I...

29:31.709 --> 29:32.899
Had to.

29:32.999 --> 29:34.359
I would have
done it first,

29:34.459 --> 29:35.818
but you beat me to it.

29:35.918 --> 29:36.401
All right, well,

29:36.501 --> 29:37.942
he's only got
two more lives left.

29:38.042 --> 29:39.734
And we've only got
one option.

29:39.834 --> 29:41.692
But we already
looked in <i>The Book.</i>

29:41.792 --> 29:42.526
We look again.

29:42.626 --> 29:44.999
No more pussyfooting around.

29:49.209 --> 29:51.442
PATTY:
Why now, Mother?

29:51.542 --> 29:53.818
We both know why.

29:53.918 --> 29:55.899
We're just not willing
to say it.

29:55.999 --> 29:58.776
Please don't.
I'm not well, Patty.

29:58.876 --> 29:59.899
When I die...

29:59.999 --> 30:00.484
Mother.

30:00.584 --> 30:01.401
When I die,

30:01.501 --> 30:03.899
the girls will receive
their powers.

30:03.999 --> 30:06.609
I have to stop that
from happening.

30:06.709 --> 30:07.776
But it's their destiny.

30:07.876 --> 30:09.567
It's what they're meant to be.

30:09.667 --> 30:10.359
Who are we to decide

30:10.459 --> 30:11.899
that they're meant
to be witches?

30:11.999 --> 30:14.484
Who are we to decide
that they're not?

30:14.584 --> 30:16.484
This isn't your choice to make.

30:16.584 --> 30:19.999
But the girls
are mine to protect.

30:20.709 --> 30:21.859
(<i>grunting</i>)

30:21.959 --> 30:23.359
Mom, are you
all right?

30:23.459 --> 30:24.651
I'm fine.

30:24.751 --> 30:26.876
Don't change the subject.

30:29.209 --> 30:31.999
Patty, they're not ready.

30:32.417 --> 30:34.275
Do you really
want me to put them

30:34.375 --> 30:37.167
directly in harm's way?

30:43.918 --> 30:45.667
Good night.

31:13.834 --> 31:18.734
(<i>panting</i>)

31:18.834 --> 31:21.667
It's now or never.

31:35.584 --> 31:38.125
(<i>latch clicks</i>)

31:39.709 --> 31:41.983
(<i>breathing heavily</i>)

31:42.083 --> 31:43.709
(<i>screams</i>)

31:45.042 --> 31:46.792
(<i>screams</i>)

31:50.209 --> 31:52.751
(<i>footsteps approaching</i>)

31:54.042 --> 31:54.942
Grams?

31:55.042 --> 31:55.818
Grams?

31:55.918 --> 31:57.567
Prue, Phoebe, somebody help!

31:57.667 --> 31:59.918
Oh my God, Grams.

32:01.292 --> 32:03.417
Oh, God.

32:09.999 --> 32:10.900
(<i>thud</i>)

32:11.000 --> 32:16.025
(<i>screaming</i>)

32:16.125 --> 32:17.983
(<i>stake lands</i>)

32:18.083 --> 32:20.150
Well, that's number eight.

32:20.250 --> 32:21.192
One life to live.

32:21.292 --> 32:24.734
I know life isn't fair,
but this sucks.

32:24.834 --> 32:26.067
I know, he left a stain,
but I think

32:26.167 --> 32:27.651
with a little water and...

32:27.751 --> 32:28.078
No.

32:28.088 --> 32:30.526
Death isn't brief,
it's permanent,

32:30.626 --> 32:32.484
and this guy
gets to cheat it

32:32.584 --> 32:34.150
not once, but nine times.

32:34.250 --> 32:36.442
Yeah, cheaters
aren't supposed to prosper.

32:36.542 --> 32:38.983
You know, if he had any idea
what death was really like,

32:39.083 --> 32:41.401
you know, the real thing,
not the abridged version,

32:41.501 --> 32:44.526
he wouldn't be so hot
under the collar to do it again.

32:44.626 --> 32:45.484
What if we

32:45.584 --> 32:47.067
showed him?

32:47.167 --> 32:48.192
What do you mean?

32:48.292 --> 32:49.234
Well, every time
he dies,

32:49.334 --> 32:51.150
he feels pain, right?

32:51.250 --> 32:52.900
Yeah, but only for a second.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.526
But what if, somehow,

32:54.626 --> 32:57.067
we could catch him
in that second,

32:57.167 --> 32:58.442
on the instant
of death

32:58.542 --> 33:01.442
in that one moment where
he actually feels pain,

33:01.542 --> 33:04.275
and then magnify
it nine times?

33:04.375 --> 33:04.983
Then he would

33:05.083 --> 33:06.734
feel the pain of nine deaths,

33:06.834 --> 33:10.484
and it actually
might be enough to kill him.

33:10.584 --> 33:11.567
I like it.

33:11.667 --> 33:13.900
Well, we only have got one shot.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.567
Any other ideas?

33:15.667 --> 33:15.983
Mm-mm.

33:16.083 --> 33:17.999
Let's do it.

33:29.876 --> 33:31.209
Hey.

33:33.042 --> 33:34.192
Hey.

33:34.292 --> 33:35.609
(<i>sniffles</i>)

33:35.709 --> 33:36.900
You okay?

33:37.000 --> 33:39.999
I'm...

33:43.959 --> 33:46.999
I'm not really.

33:47.584 --> 33:48.317
I don't know how we're

33:48.417 --> 33:50.442
supposed to deal
with this, Prue.

33:50.542 --> 33:53.192
And it's not
just losing her,

33:53.292 --> 33:54.859
it's the funeral
arrangements

33:54.959 --> 33:57.334
and the doctors,
and the lawyers.

33:58.626 --> 34:01.667
And there's nobody
left to help us.

34:05.626 --> 34:07.834
For what it's worth...

34:09.998 --> 34:11.400
the service today, Piper,

34:11.501 --> 34:13.501
it was really beautiful.

34:16.167 --> 34:19.998
She would have liked
what you said.

34:20.458 --> 34:22.876
(<i>softly</i>):
Thanks.

34:23.626 --> 34:27.899
I know that this
is gonna sound strange, but...

34:27.998 --> 34:30.083
Do you think that she heard?

34:31.918 --> 34:34.958
I think she did.

34:43.833 --> 34:44.734
I'd still like to know

34:44.833 --> 34:46.899
what she was
doing up there.

34:46.998 --> 34:47.818
Up where?

34:47.918 --> 34:51.025
Piper thinks that Grams
was up in the attic

34:51.125 --> 34:52.067
before she died.

34:52.167 --> 34:53.317
That's not possible.

34:53.417 --> 34:54.150
She always told us

34:54.250 --> 34:56.958
that the attic
was sealed off.

34:57.083 --> 34:58.899
Yeah, well, then
what was she doing

34:58.999 --> 35:00.999
coming down those stairs?

35:01.792 --> 35:02.442
Um...

35:02.542 --> 35:05.275
I think the more
important question is...

35:05.375 --> 35:07.109
(<i>sighs</i>)

35:07.209 --> 35:09.999
...what are we doing?

35:10.584 --> 35:11.899
What do you mean?

35:11.999 --> 35:14.192
I mean precisely what Grams

35:14.292 --> 35:16.899
was always concerned about.

35:16.999 --> 35:17.899
Our future.

35:17.999 --> 35:20.359
The only reason
we're all

35:20.459 --> 35:21.818
still here,

35:21.918 --> 35:24.234
still together,
is because of her.

35:24.334 --> 35:25.899
And now, Prue,

35:25.999 --> 35:27.899
you've already got
one foot out the door

35:27.999 --> 35:28.859
and...

35:28.959 --> 35:30.899
Piper, I know you don't
want to bunk with me

35:30.999 --> 35:32.150
any longer than
you have to.

35:32.250 --> 35:35.209
So let's just face it.

35:35.959 --> 35:38.584
She was the glue.

35:39.042 --> 35:41.442
Why don't we talk about this
over dinner?

35:41.542 --> 35:42.567
(<i>weepy</i>):
I'll make, um,

35:42.667 --> 35:45.876
one of Grams' favorite meals.

35:46.167 --> 35:47.359
She always
liked the idea

35:47.459 --> 35:49.626
of me being
in the kitchen.

35:50.667 --> 35:52.317
Uh... a-a-actually,

35:52.417 --> 35:56.999
I'm sort of supposed to spend
the night with Roger.

35:57.501 --> 35:59.150
What about you, Pheebs?

35:59.250 --> 36:00.526
Table for two?

36:00.626 --> 36:02.067
Uh...

36:02.167 --> 36:07.899
actually, I was thinking
about... getting out of here.

36:07.999 --> 36:10.709
Are you going out?

36:11.501 --> 36:12.899
No.

36:12.999 --> 36:15.876
Going away.

36:16.751 --> 36:18.000
I, um...

36:18.334 --> 36:20.776
I'm not sure what
my future holds,

36:20.876 --> 36:24.275
but I do know it's
not in San Francisco.

36:24.375 --> 36:26.292
Phoebe, you don't
have to...

36:26.999 --> 36:28.442
It's okay.

36:28.542 --> 36:30.899
We all know that the only thing

36:30.999 --> 36:34.484
that I contribute to this
threesome is trouble, so...

36:34.584 --> 36:35.899
I'm going to go

36:35.999 --> 36:38.899
and see what
New York thinks of me.

36:38.999 --> 36:42.401
Whatever my destiny may be...

36:42.501 --> 36:44.567
I might find it there.

36:44.667 --> 36:46.484
Phoebe, what
about school?

36:46.584 --> 36:50.083
Well, school will still be there
if I come back.

36:50.542 --> 36:52.818
Grams always said
that we all...

36:52.918 --> 36:54.999
had a purpose.

36:56.042 --> 37:02.999
So... maybe we'll have an easier
time finding it on our own.

37:13.375 --> 37:15.109
Uh, I guess
I'm going to...

37:15.209 --> 37:18.292
(<i>door closes</i>)
Yeah.

37:19.667 --> 37:21.999
Okay.

37:35.042 --> 37:35.983
Spell?

37:36.083 --> 37:36.899
Check. Potion?

37:36.999 --> 37:39.359
Check. Sharp,
painful implement?

37:39.459 --> 37:39.942
Check.

37:40.042 --> 37:41.442
Ooh, nice choice.

37:41.542 --> 37:41.899
Thank you.

37:41.999 --> 37:42.899
PIPER:
So, what is our level

37:42.999 --> 37:44.150
of confidence in this plan?

37:44.250 --> 37:45.401
Well, on a scale of one to ten,

37:45.501 --> 37:48.442
ten being we whoop ass,
one being he laughs at us

37:48.542 --> 37:49.899
while we're on fire and naked...

37:49.999 --> 37:50.942
PIPER:
Maybe you should

37:51.042 --> 37:52.459
lie to me.

37:53.751 --> 37:56.375
Hello, ladies.

37:56.999 --> 37:57.899
Mm...

37:57.999 --> 38:01.359
I love the smell of defeated
witch in the evening.

38:01.459 --> 38:03.899
Yeah, can we just
get this over
with, please?

38:03.999 --> 38:07.150
Oh, it's fine
when you want to have coffee,

38:07.250 --> 38:09.651
but when I want
to exchange pleasantries,

38:09.751 --> 38:11.999
you're in a hurry to kill me.

38:12.584 --> 38:13.401
Where are your manners?

38:13.501 --> 38:16.317
We lost them
when that girl lost her life.

38:16.417 --> 38:18.999
And whose fault is that?

38:19.417 --> 38:21.109
(<i>clears throat</i>)

38:21.209 --> 38:22.983
Wait a minute.

38:23.083 --> 38:25.792
Do you think
I'm an idiot?

38:25.999 --> 38:28.442
You've got something
up your sleeve.

38:28.542 --> 38:31.334
Hello? Sleeveless.

38:31.501 --> 38:33.234
You know the moment
that I gain immortality,

38:33.334 --> 38:37.359
I'm coming back here to mangle
your pretty little faces.

38:37.459 --> 38:39.542
Do you want to die or not?

38:43.626 --> 38:44.900
Do it.

38:45.000 --> 38:48.776
All righty,
then, ready?

38:48.876 --> 38:49.899
(<i>grunts</i>)

38:49.999 --> 38:50.999
Now!

38:52.999 --> 38:54.899

"Nine times the evil's
cheated death,

38:54.999 --> 38:56.651

"This warlock standing
in our midst,

38:58.626 --> 39:01.542
let him feel
what he has missed."

39:10.751 --> 39:12.317
(<i>shrieking</i>)

39:12.417 --> 39:16.918
No. No!

39:20.375 --> 39:21.899
(<i>sighs</i>)

39:21.999 --> 39:24.651
Okay. Was that for good?

39:24.751 --> 39:25.484
Well, if it wasn't,

39:25.584 --> 39:26.567
he's really going
to miss his ear,

39:26.667 --> 39:30.401
'cause it looks like
part of it's dripping
off the clock.

39:30.501 --> 39:31.109
PIPER:
Ick.

39:31.209 --> 39:32.899
Um, ninth time is the charm.

39:32.999 --> 39:35.692
That was definitely different.
He's gone for good.

39:35.792 --> 39:38.776
And yet somehow
we're still here.

39:38.876 --> 39:40.359
Still together.

39:40.459 --> 39:42.751
Not for long.

39:45.334 --> 39:47.192
Is there anything special
you want to do

39:47.292 --> 39:48.983
on your last night here?

39:49.083 --> 39:51.192
Um...

39:51.292 --> 39:52.442
I don't know.

39:52.542 --> 39:56.834
I guess can I just have
a couple of minutes alone?

39:57.584 --> 39:58.983
Yeah, uh...

39:59.083 --> 40:02.918
We'll be upstairs
if you, you know...

40:51.876 --> 40:53.526
Everything okay?

40:53.626 --> 40:55.484
Am I that obvious?

40:55.584 --> 40:59.651
No, I'm just
incredibly perceptive.

40:59.751 --> 41:03.918
You want to pull
up a tailgate?

41:04.751 --> 41:10.526
Um... something just
doesn't feel right.

41:10.626 --> 41:13.899
I mean, I know this
step has to happen,

41:13.999 --> 41:15.484
and I want
it to happen.

41:15.584 --> 41:17.626
It's just that...

41:17.792 --> 41:22.484
...when Prue,
Phoebe and I moved
back in together,

41:22.584 --> 41:24.899
it made us
sisters again,

41:24.999 --> 41:29.417
and I don't think we're
ready to test that yet.

41:29.999 --> 41:33.292
And then there's this.

41:36.125 --> 41:37.359
I think we both know

41:37.459 --> 41:41.859
what those ingredients
would do to us...

41:41.959 --> 41:44.359
and the fact that
Grams was willing

41:44.459 --> 41:46.983
to keep us from
being witches

41:47.083 --> 41:48.899
to keep us together...

41:48.999 --> 41:52.734
well, that should
mean something,

41:52.834 --> 41:54.042
shouldn't it?

41:55.709 --> 41:58.942
You going to hate me?

41:59.042 --> 42:03.999
Not if we can hire movers
to move everything back in.

42:10.584 --> 42:11.067
(<i>door closes</i>)

42:11.167 --> 42:13.401
Hey, can we talk to you
for a second?

42:13.501 --> 42:15.317
It's kind of important.

42:15.417 --> 42:16.150
Sure.

42:16.250 --> 42:17.692
Everything okay?

42:17.792 --> 42:19.234
Yeah, it's, um...

42:19.334 --> 42:21.067
just, well, we're
more than excited

42:21.167 --> 42:24.192
that you and
Leo decided to
move back in.

42:24.292 --> 42:24.899
Um...

42:24.999 --> 42:28.918
we sort of have to ask you
to move back out again.

42:29.999 --> 42:31.125
Of your room.

42:31.959 --> 42:32.899
And into mine.

42:32.999 --> 42:34.899
I mean, it is
twice as big,

42:34.999 --> 42:36.109
and you now are

42:36.209 --> 42:37.776
twice the people.

42:37.876 --> 42:38.609
Really?

42:38.709 --> 42:39.192
Really.

42:39.292 --> 42:40.317
That would be great.

42:40.417 --> 42:42.818
That would be so amazing.
Oh, ow! Ow!

42:42.918 --> 42:43.651
That would be so great.

42:43.751 --> 42:44.899
Hey, you know what?
Thank you so much.

42:44.999 --> 42:47.234
I-I deserve hugs, too,
because I'm moving

42:47.334 --> 42:48.651
all of my stuff out
of your bathroom

42:48.751 --> 42:50.859
so you and Leo could
do the, you know, that...

42:50.959 --> 42:52.776
Oh, that would...
that would be really great.
private.

42:52.876 --> 42:55.900
Yeah.
See, it'll be just like
having your own place.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.734
Yeah, only with
your sisters right
down the hall.

42:58.834 --> 43:01.899
Yeah. I mean, I know that we
can't be together forever...

43:01.999 --> 43:06.918
But it feels good
that forever isn't today.
