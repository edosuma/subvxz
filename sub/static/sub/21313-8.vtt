WEBVTT

00:13.760 --> 00:18.094
Well, that'll be the day
When you say goodbye...

00:18.180 --> 00:20.466
Here we go.
Buddy Holly's a perfect example.

00:21.470 --> 00:23.722
Buddy Holly, the day he died, uh--

00:23.810 --> 00:27.223
Yeah, I know, he won a coin flip,
or he wouldn't have been on the plane.

00:27.310 --> 00:29.437
No, it was actually Valens
that won the coin toss.

00:29.520 --> 00:31.397
It was Buddy Holly
that chartered the plane.

00:31.480 --> 00:33.027
Do you wanna know why?

00:33.110 --> 00:34.737
He was tired of riding in shitty buses?

00:35.450 --> 00:38.772
No, he was tired of shitty underwear.

00:38.870 --> 00:41.441
So he decided that he wanted
to get to wherever he was going

00:41.540 --> 00:43.701
as quickly as possible,
so he could do laundry.

00:43.790 --> 00:45.075
--It's true.

00:45.170 --> 00:47.741
You're saying "The Day the Music Died"
was because of soiled briefs?

00:47.830 --> 00:51.163
Another good example is D-Day.
The Nazis knew that we were coming,

00:51.250 --> 00:52.956
so they wanted to line the beach
with tanks

00:53.050 --> 00:54.711
so they could literally blow us
out of the water.

00:54.800 --> 00:57.633
But Hitler decided that_
it was a good day for sedatives.

00:57.720 --> 00:59.210
So they couldn't wake him up

00:59.300 --> 01:01.882
to get the final sign-off for the tanks,
and the rest is history.

01:01.970 --> 01:04.222
-What the hell are you talking about?
-I'm talking about decisions.

01:04.310 --> 01:06.187
-What, I'm Hitler in this analogy?
-No.

01:06.810 --> 01:08.687
- I would hope not.

01:08.770 --> 01:12.183
Uh, I'm just saying that
any decision made, big or small,

01:12.280 --> 01:15.317
has an impact around the world.
It's difficult.

01:15.400 --> 01:18.733
Marty, I just don't need
a theoretical analysis right now.

01:18.870 --> 01:20.690
I know. I'm just saying this is tough.

01:21.330 --> 01:22.479
I know.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.035
Marty, watch out.

01:41.010 --> 01:45.049
What we're looking for is
further development in the global market.

01:45.140 --> 01:48.189
Right now, we have the number one
growth percentage in our industry

01:48.270 --> 01:49.976
throughout North America,

01:50.060 --> 01:51.857
and have provided
all of the ceramic tiling,

01:51.940 --> 01:53.180
the high-end ceramic tiling,

01:53.280 --> 01:55.737
that you'll see in these recent
condominium projects

01:55.820 --> 01:57.139
right here in Chicago.

01:57.240 --> 01:58.946
The figures are all there.

01:59.610 --> 02:04.035
Whoever we hire has the potential
to beneﬁt exponentially,

02:04.120 --> 02:06.190
if they're in the know of proper risks--

02:06.290 --> 02:09.327
Well, Mr. Del Rio, we're only really
concerned with how much you benefit,

02:09.420 --> 02:12.412
with the sole focus being
your company's diversification.

02:12.500 --> 02:16.789
And... And as you expand, we'll keep a cap
on the number of new accounts we take on,

02:16.880 --> 02:20.464
in contrast to these bigger ﬁrms
who can easily swallow you up.

02:20.550 --> 02:22.757
Where here, you'll be numero uno.

02:24.470 --> 02:25.960
And what is your name?

02:27.140 --> 02:28.380
Marty Byrde.

02:30.020 --> 02:32.056
Mr. Byrde, I'd like to hear your thoughts.

02:33.150 --> 02:36.392
Yeah, okay. I, uh...
To be honest, you know, I...

02:36.480 --> 02:38.732
I can't really assess much
until I look at the numbers.

02:38.820 --> 02:39.809
I'm the numbers guy.

02:39.900 --> 02:42.152
That's a... That's a good word
to remember. "Honest."

02:42.240 --> 02:44.367
You see, these big firms,
they would just jump right in

02:44.450 --> 02:46.782
-without properly analyzing the data.
-Hmm.

02:47.540 --> 02:49.997
Very well. I'll be waiting.

02:51.120 --> 02:52.530
Well, this could take a while.

02:53.340 --> 02:54.455
Oh, I have time.

02:56.630 --> 02:58.461
-Are you sure?
-Okay.

03:11.230 --> 03:13.391
You last worked
for the Rush campaign?

03:13.480 --> 03:14.299
Yes.

03:14.980 --> 03:18.108
Yes, I did his three... his three runs.

03:18.190 --> 03:21.023
And then I also worked for Obama's,
uh, state senate race.

03:21.110 --> 03:24.193
Yeah, but... before he was Obama.

03:25.870 --> 03:27.861
My dad worked on
one of the Rush campaigns.

03:28.830 --> 03:30.866
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

03:30.960 --> 03:33.622
-I'm sorry, what's your last name?
-Rakowski.

03:34.290 --> 03:35.951
Rakowski? Tim?

03:36.750 --> 03:38.798
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God!

03:38.880 --> 03:41.007
Oh, my God, I see the resemblance.
How's he doing?

03:41.090 --> 03:43.581
Retired. We don't talk much.

03:44.930 --> 03:46.045
Oh.

03:47.180 --> 03:49.057
You last worked on it in...

03:49.560 --> 03:50.925
Um, 2002.

03:52.730 --> 03:53.799
Right.

03:53.900 --> 03:57.108
I was really pregnant
with my daughter Charlotte at the time.

03:57.190 --> 03:58.566
I didn't think I was gonna make it.

03:58.650 --> 04:01.483
And then I was about to come back and I...
I had my son Jonah--

04:01.570 --> 04:03.447
Well, what we're really looking for here

04:03.530 --> 04:06.442
is a press manager with their finger
on the pulse, 'cause--

04:06.530 --> 04:09.033
You don't have your finger on the pulse,
you're not gonna connect

04:09.120 --> 04:11.577
with the 18 to 295 _
who are gonna swing the election.

04:14.500 --> 04:17.742
I'm sorry, it's just, I...
I know that speech.

04:17.840 --> 04:19.489
I gave that speech

04:19.590 --> 04:23.424
to people who sat in this chair when
I was sitting in yours, so, you know...

04:23.510 --> 04:27.594
Look, my... my rsum clearly tells you
that I can do this job.

04:28.350 --> 04:31.262
And I understand that
the future of campaigning is online.

04:31.350 --> 04:33.887
I'm on Myspace, I'm on Friendster,

04:33.980 --> 04:37.302
and there's a new network called Facebook,
which I think is gonna be influential.

04:37.400 --> 04:39.607
So, I know how to reach young people.

04:41.400 --> 04:42.435
I'll level with you.

04:42.530 --> 04:46.523
You seem like a nice woman,
and, clearly, you're qualified.

04:47.490 --> 04:50.789
So is everyone else,
and they're coming off recent campaigns.

04:52.450 --> 04:53.439
I'm sorry.

04:55.830 --> 04:59.493
Anthony, what did I tell you?
Don't look at me like that. Play nice.

05:01.550 --> 05:04.166
Think you should take
your own advice, Louis.

05:04.260 --> 05:06.296
-Really? Here in the playground?
-Mm-hmm.

05:06.380 --> 05:10.305
You people have no shame, do you?
I told you to call my lawyer.

05:10.390 --> 05:14.383
Oh, sure, I'll call, but just thought
you might wanna see this.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.131
Dad! Dad, look at me now!

05:19.230 --> 05:21.186
You know your choices, right?

05:21.270 --> 05:22.976
- Work with me...
- Dad!

05:23.070 --> 05:24.890
...or watch Anthony grow up
from a six-by-ten

05:24.990 --> 05:27.697
while you chow down
on bean gruel with roach feces,

05:27.780 --> 05:31.079
-and try to navigate risky showers.
-Dad! Look at me, Dad!

05:31.160 --> 05:34.118
-Your call.
-Look at me, Dad!

05:34.200 --> 05:37.419
- Damn it, Anthony, I see you!
- Hey, come on, man!

05:40.250 --> 05:42.241
You know the position
you're putting me in, right?

05:42.340 --> 05:43.876
That's the point, Lou.

05:44.920 --> 05:46.126
Take your time.

05:46.920 --> 05:48.672
Meet me here on Monday.

05:49.590 --> 05:51.296
Your family will thank you.

05:56.020 --> 05:57.885
- Shit! Fuck!
- Ah.

05:57.980 --> 05:59.891
- Well, it's straight.
- Shit!

06:00.650 --> 06:04.108
- Whatever, whatever.
- I see it. You're all right.

06:04.190 --> 06:05.771
I need more time to warm up.

06:05.860 --> 06:08.192
All right, Del.
Right down the middle.

06:08.280 --> 06:10.737
- Have to account for the wind.
- Yeah.

06:15.080 --> 06:16.149
Yeah!

06:16.700 --> 06:18.827
-Damn. Hell of a shot, Del.
-Beautiful.

06:21.080 --> 06:22.377
Nice tempo on that swing, too.

06:22.460 --> 06:23.870
You've been playing since last time.

06:23.960 --> 06:25.200
Not really.

06:25.300 --> 06:26.836
Listen, I had a thought.

06:27.760 --> 06:31.389
You know, Chicago fucking winters
are brutal. I can't take it.

06:31.470 --> 06:33.461
It might be beneficial for both of us

06:33.560 --> 06:36.518
if I set up a shop somewhere warm,
like where you're at.

06:36.600 --> 06:38.090
-Maybe down in the Caymans.
-Louis?

06:38.180 --> 06:39.056
Yeah?

06:39.140 --> 06:42.553
A man who only talks business
is a failure in all aspects of life.

06:44.150 --> 06:45.219
Just golf.

06:45.690 --> 06:46.850
This is vacation.

06:49.860 --> 06:51.350
Don't you worry, Louis.

06:51.820 --> 06:54.118
Old Brucey's just getting warmed up.

06:55.280 --> 06:58.158
When he starts talking about himself
in third person, we're golden.

06:58.250 --> 06:59.899
And here comes the pain.

07:01.420 --> 07:02.569
Eh...

07:02.670 --> 07:04.410
Fuck.

07:05.880 --> 07:06.995
Okay.

07:13.300 --> 07:16.178
-Huh?
-The best smack talk? No talk at all.

07:18.560 --> 07:21.597
I wish restaurants still had
smoking sections, you know?

07:21.690 --> 07:24.352
Mm. You should run for office
on that platform, Ma.

07:24.440 --> 07:26.601
Yeah, maybe I will.
Couldn't be any worse.

07:29.070 --> 07:30.059
So how's work?

07:31.610 --> 07:34.864
-I left that job.
-Why? I thought you loved it.

07:34.950 --> 07:38.738
You know, I had to reschedule one day,
last minute. They pitched a fit.

07:39.410 --> 07:41.492
And I did a damn good job for them, too.

07:41.580 --> 07:45.038
-What... so you were fired?
-It was mutual.

07:46.540 --> 07:49.202
This is the second time_ this month
that you left a job.

07:49.300 --> 07:51.916
Oh, come on, please.
My ankle's been bothering me.

07:53.090 --> 07:54.216
Okay.

07:57.390 --> 08:00.052
- Hi, Barb.
- Oh, hi, sweetie.

08:02.270 --> 08:03.897
-Hey.
-Sorry I'm late.

08:06.690 --> 08:09.318
Oh, what? You never seen a kiss before?

08:10.190 --> 08:11.316
--Shh.

08:12.490 --> 08:16.028
-So, what did I miss?
-Ma was just pining for the days

08:16.120 --> 08:18.327
when you could get lung cancer
with your lunch.

08:18.410 --> 08:20.822
My dad would agree with you.

08:26.130 --> 08:28.837
No... You know,
it's our generation.

08:28.920 --> 08:31.912
But, you know, he never gives me credit
for how progressive I am.

08:32.010 --> 08:34.217
He kept you a secret from me
for over a year.

08:34.300 --> 08:36.256
It was for your own protection, trust me.

08:36.340 --> 08:39.002
Yeah, right.
I couldn't be happier you got each other.

08:39.100 --> 08:41.386
Now I don't have to worry about
some floozy breaking his heart.

08:41.470 --> 08:43.097
No. No, you do not.

08:44.560 --> 08:45.640
Oh, I'll be right back.

08:45.730 --> 08:47.436
Um, get me a box for this, please.

08:47.520 --> 08:48.817
- I'm full.
- Sure.

08:54.150 --> 08:55.856
-Is everything good?
-Yeah.

08:56.820 --> 08:59.448
-What do you mean?
-Nothing, it's just...

08:59.530 --> 09:00.736
She seems a little off.

09:01.490 --> 09:03.321
Well, she just lost another job.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.456
Oh, okay.

09:06.460 --> 09:07.575
What?

09:08.580 --> 09:09.877
I didn't say anything.

09:10.340 --> 09:13.252
No, but you were obviously
thinking something.

09:14.010 --> 09:17.218
- Are you irritated?
- No.

09:18.720 --> 09:20.176
But what were you thinking?

09:20.970 --> 09:23.347
Well, she's just, you know...

09:24.680 --> 09:27.228
Her eyes, it looks like
she might be on something.

09:27.310 --> 09:29.642
-Like what?
-I don't know.

09:29.730 --> 09:31.766
-Pills, possibly.
-No.

09:31.860 --> 09:33.680
She went through all that
when she moved out.

09:33.780 --> 09:34.769
Okay.

09:34.860 --> 09:37.397
I just think I'm pretty sure
I would know if she was on something.

09:37.490 --> 09:38.980
Hey, she's your mom,

09:39.070 --> 09:42.153
but from what I've seen, the ones closest
to the person often miss it.

09:42.240 --> 09:45.152
I mean, they can't imagine a loved one
doing that to themselves.

09:53.880 --> 09:57.122
It's almost like they cook it so more
people get sick and have to be admitted.

09:57.720 --> 09:59.836
Sound fucking business plan,
you ask me.

10:00.430 --> 10:02.546
-No good, huh?
-No bueno.

10:04.680 --> 10:07.228
Thanks for coming. Really appreciate it.

10:07.310 --> 10:09.847
Are you kidding me? Where else would I be?
Come on.

10:11.110 --> 10:13.396
Though I did see a hot candy striper
on the third floor,

10:13.480 --> 10:15.812
so I'm gonna have to duck out
and say hello...

10:15.900 --> 10:17.481
-Hmm.
-...for a few.

10:17.570 --> 10:19.151
-All right.
-Have some action.

10:19.700 --> 10:20.940
Mm-hmm.

10:23.330 --> 10:25.901
Look, Marty, if you need help...

10:26.910 --> 10:29.663
with anything...
like, anything, watching the kids...

10:30.170 --> 10:33.378
-You've never watched kids in your life.
-That is true, but how hard could it be?

10:33.460 --> 10:36.008
They're just like you and me, only...
only smaller.

10:37.550 --> 10:39.086
You'd be surprised.

10:42.300 --> 10:44.552
Marty, you can't blame yourself
for what happened.

10:46.850 --> 10:48.169
-I know.
-Do you?

10:48.270 --> 10:49.089
Yeah.

10:49.480 --> 10:51.186
I'm serious,
there's nothing you could do.

10:51.270 --> 10:54.353
Like my dad always said,
"Everything happens for a reason."

10:55.900 --> 10:59.484
Your dad sounds like he was full of shit.
With all due respect.

10:59.570 --> 11:01.197
Yeah, well, perhaps.

11:01.280 --> 11:03.987
You really believe that?
You really think that there's some...

11:04.080 --> 11:06.480
some preordained chart,
floating around up in the ether,

11:06.580 --> 11:07.740
with our fate all figured out?

11:07.830 --> 11:10.492
-I don't know about a preordained chart--
-That's a bunch of crap.

11:10.580 --> 11:15.085
Things happen because human beings
make decisions, they commit acts...

11:15.840 --> 11:17.046
and that makes things happen.

11:17.130 --> 11:21.578
And it creates a snowball effect
with the...

11:21.680 --> 11:25.252
you know, their world around them,
causes other people to make decisions.

11:25.350 --> 11:28.057
Cycle continues, snowball keeps rolling.

11:29.680 --> 11:31.261
And even when that's not the case,

11:31.350 --> 11:34.478
when life's events are not connected
to other people's deCISlonS and actions,

11:34.560 --> 11:37.358
it's not some bullshit fucking test
sent down from the universe

11:37.440 --> 11:39.351
-to check your resolve, you know.
-Okay.

11:39.440 --> 11:40.691
I mean, what would the reason be

11:40.780 --> 11:43.522
for some healthy five-year-old
to get a brain tumor?

11:44.070 --> 11:46.903
Or why would a tsunami wipe out a village?

11:46.990 --> 11:49.197
You tell those families
everything happens for a reason.

11:51.830 --> 11:55.459
No, sometimes people make decisions,
shit happens,

11:55.540 --> 11:57.371
and we gotta act accordingly.

11:57.960 --> 12:01.714
Or you can... crawl in a hole and die,
you know?

12:03.300 --> 12:06.212
Well, it was a shitty thing
for me to say and...

12:06.300 --> 12:08.006
...I'm sorry, bud.

12:15.480 --> 12:16.640
Hello?

12:18.270 --> 12:19.567
Honey?

12:23.110 --> 12:24.407
Wendy?

12:29.660 --> 12:30.866
Jonah?

12:34.620 --> 12:36.326
Guys, anybody home?

13:04.150 --> 13:06.778
-Hey, guys. Hi.
-Hi, Dad.

13:06.860 --> 13:08.487
Where's Mommy?

13:08.570 --> 13:10.367
- I don't know.
- Okay.

13:10.450 --> 13:12.532
Do me a favor and watch
the rest of the movie inside?

13:12.620 --> 13:15.703
It's getting cold. I'll check upstairs.
I'll be right back, okay?

13:15.790 --> 13:17.826
- You get that.
- I'll get that.

13:31.510 --> 13:32.886
Hi.

13:32.970 --> 13:35.052
Honey, the kids were all alone
in the yard.

13:35.140 --> 13:37.688
It's been ﬁve minutes. It's just...
It's only five minutes.

13:37.770 --> 13:39.852
-But that's five minutes.
-What do you want me to do?

13:39.940 --> 13:42.147
Burst in tears in front of them
or come up here?

13:42.230 --> 13:44.312
-I think I made the right choice.
-Okay.

13:44.740 --> 13:46.389
At least I had a choice.

13:46.950 --> 13:49.362
--What can I do to help you feel better?

13:49.450 --> 13:50.860
Nothing, Marty.

14:06.510 --> 14:08.000
- Welcome, seor.
- You made it.

14:08.090 --> 14:10.081
Hi. Hey, Del. Yeah, we made it.
How are you?

14:10.180 --> 14:12.592
- Bienvenido_s.
- Marty, this is my Wife, Elena.

14:12.680 --> 14:14.307
So, Wendy, what do you do?

14:14.390 --> 14:16.847
--Well, I... work for political campaigns.

14:16.930 --> 14:19.899
Or, I... I used to, anyway.

14:19.980 --> 14:22.767
Get out! I helped run
our last mayoral campaign back home.

14:22.860 --> 14:25.476
Oh, really? Is it as corrupt there
as it is in Chicago?

14:25.570 --> 14:27.106
- Don't get me started.

14:27.190 --> 14:28.691
- Hey.
- Sorry, I'm late.

14:28.780 --> 14:30.862
Sorry, I'm late, Del.
Raul, how's the wine?

14:31.450 --> 14:33.077
-Yeah?
-Hey. Hi. Marty.

14:33.620 --> 14:37.408
Didn't I see you at the Finance &amp; Credit
Conference in Chicago a few weeks ago?

14:38.500 --> 14:39.740
Oh, God, shoot me.

14:39.830 --> 14:42.287
Never catch me dead
at one of those snoozefests, huh?

14:42.380 --> 14:44.701
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah. Like, tell me about it, right?

14:44.800 --> 14:45.869
Like, pick your poison.

14:45.960 --> 14:49.544
Either you can, uh... you can
listen to the blah-blah-blah lectures

14:49.630 --> 14:51.177
or engage with one of the homely women.

14:51.800 --> 14:54.462
The what, Bruce?
What kind of women?

14:54.560 --> 14:57.267
Who go to conferences,
and are smart and deal in finance?

14:57.350 --> 15:00.137
-What kind of women?
-I don't know what you're talking about.

15:00.230 --> 15:03.472
-You're on your own here, Bruce.
-Yes, Bruce, what do you mean by "homely"?

15:03.560 --> 15:05.767
Oh. Homely, homely.
I just meant, uh, thoughtful...

15:05.860 --> 15:07.475
- Get him.
- ...and nurturing...

15:07.570 --> 15:08.810
Yeah. Backpedal.

15:08.900 --> 15:11.277
I'm gonna take Wendy's advice
and reel it back.

15:11.360 --> 15:14.693
- Reel it back, my friend.
- When in doubt, take Wendy's advice.

15:14.780 --> 15:17.362
But to come to Bruce's mild defense,

15:17.450 --> 15:19.532
he was always the first person
at the hospital

15:19.620 --> 15:22.168
when the kids were born.
You know, or at least the second.

15:22.250 --> 15:23.285
-Yeah.
-Or the...

15:23.880 --> 15:25.620
-the fourth or the fifth...
-Top five.

15:25.710 --> 15:26.950
But it totally just...

15:27.050 --> 15:29.837
just offsets the time when he made
that speech at our wedding

15:29.920 --> 15:32.832
just to make sure that the maid of honor
knew what room he was in.

15:32.930 --> 15:35.000
Yeah. Well, I... I had a suite.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.761
Wendy, I'm going to the street fair
tomorrow morning.

15:40.850 --> 15:42.056
Would you please come with me?

15:42.140 --> 15:44.722
Oh. I... Iwould really like that.
Thank you.

15:44.810 --> 15:47.722
This is good. So the fellas can,
you know, hit the links.

15:48.360 --> 15:51.773
-Mmm. Yes, please. Sounds good. Yeah?
-Louis, are you practicing your swing?

15:53.700 --> 15:56.021
- That's convincing.
- Yeah, that did not...

15:56.120 --> 15:58.361
- I did ﬁnd something.
- You did?

15:58.450 --> 16:01.453
Yeah, a couple things, actually.
Um, you see here...

16:01.540 --> 16:02.780
Uh, this column right here.

16:02.870 --> 16:05.031
You know, first look at it,
it looks tip-top, right?

16:05.130 --> 16:07.621
But if you take a closer look,
all of these accounts here,

16:07.710 --> 16:11.214
the decimal number is rounded up
to an even number.

16:11.920 --> 16:12.909
Meaning?

16:13.010 --> 16:17.219
Uh, well, I mean, aside from that anomaly
and a few other discrepancies,

16:17.300 --> 16:19.052
you know, it all sort of...

16:19.140 --> 16:22.553
it leads me to believe that
maybe half of these accounts are...

16:22.640 --> 16:23.846
are casuistic.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.049
In layman's terms, please.

16:26.940 --> 16:29.898
Uh, that they're completely
made up, you know?

16:29.980 --> 16:34.519
And correct me if I'm wrong, but, um,
you know, I'm curious if, uh...

16:34.610 --> 16:37.067
if these false accounts weren't planted

16:37.160 --> 16:40.652
as sort of, uh,
a test for potential money managers.

16:43.040 --> 16:44.826
And if that wasn't the case?

16:45.580 --> 16:47.241
That would take me to the second point.

16:47.330 --> 16:48.957
I'm not quite sure how to say this,

16:49.050 --> 16:55.250
but it seems that someone could be
skimming off of half of these accounts.

16:56.470 --> 16:57.789
Stealing from me?

16:59.510 --> 17:01.262
I... I don't want to make any accusations,

17:01.350 --> 17:04.137
but I would imagine
you already have your suspicions,

17:04.230 --> 17:05.299
otherwise you wouldn't be here.

17:06.850 --> 17:08.511
Yes. Yes.

17:09.770 --> 17:13.854
Mr. Del Rio, this is exactly the kind
of care and detail you're gonna want.

17:13.940 --> 17:15.271
And I'd love to take credit for it,

17:15.360 --> 17:18.113
but I think it's pretty obvious
that my best asset is the fact

17:18.200 --> 17:23.194
that I'm friends with this guy,
and no other firm in Chicago employs him.

17:27.620 --> 17:29.702
Would you like to work together?

17:30.590 --> 17:33.707
-Yeah, I think that we--
-I was asking Mr. Byrde.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.210
Okay. Okay.

17:36.720 --> 17:38.381
Unfortunately, my client list is full.

17:41.970 --> 17:44.177
-I'm sorry to hear that.
-Mm.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.431
Thank you for coming in, though.

17:48.520 --> 17:51.569
Yeah, business is very busy right now,
butI".

17:51.650 --> 17:54.813
I so appreciate you coming in
and it was a pleasure to meet you.

17:57.360 --> 18:01.069
At least let me repay you
for your thoughtful analysis.

18:01.160 --> 18:02.149
My pleasure.

18:02.620 --> 18:03.939
-You sure?
-Mm. Yeah.

18:04.040 --> 18:07.328
You know, we have partnerships
with resorts all over the world.

18:07.830 --> 18:10.822
Perhaps you and yours would like
to join us for a long weekend?

18:10.920 --> 18:12.490
-Yeah.
-Oh, well, it's a nice offer.

18:12.590 --> 18:14.911
It's just... It's not a great time for me.

18:17.670 --> 18:20.298
-Thank you, Mr. Del Rio.
-Have a nice day.

18:22.140 --> 18:23.880
Dude, are you... are you fucking crazy?

18:23.970 --> 18:25.961
That was like finding
a winning lottery ticket

18:26.060 --> 18:27.675
on the heel of your shoe
after leaving the shitter,

18:27.770 --> 18:28.885
and you just sent him walking.

18:29.560 --> 18:31.801
We have no idea what his affiliations are.

18:31.900 --> 18:34.937
Affiliations? Why, 'cause he's Hispanic?
I mean, now you're profiling.

18:35.190 --> 18:36.020
No.

18:36.110 --> 18:37.930
No. You know what he does,
conscientious Marty?

18:38.030 --> 18:39.907
He tiles. He works in grout.

18:39.990 --> 18:43.027
His portfolio looked
a bit more diverse than tile.

18:43.870 --> 18:45.280
Okay. Do you know who you are?

18:45.370 --> 18:47.361
You're the guy who makes
everyone late to the party

18:47.450 --> 18:49.668
'cause you have to pick up
your ear medication.

18:49.750 --> 18:51.286
That's good.

18:51.380 --> 18:52.415
-Hm.
-That's a good one.

18:52.500 --> 18:53.376
Yeah.

18:53.960 --> 18:55.837
You're fucking killing me, dude.

19:03.140 --> 19:04.710
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

19:04.810 --> 19:07.096
Easy, Wonder Woman.
What, you couldn't wait for us?

19:07.180 --> 19:08.306
It's not heavy.

19:08.390 --> 19:10.051
-Hey, Scotty.
-How are you?

19:10.140 --> 19:13.268
-Great. Don't I look great?
-Oh, of course.

19:13.360 --> 19:14.725
Here.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.276
--Here.

19:16.360 --> 19:17.679
Isn't it beautiful?

19:18.280 --> 19:20.566
Pierces got a new one,
so they let me take it.

19:20.650 --> 19:23.562
Well, it's the least they could do,
as hard as you work for them.

19:23.660 --> 19:25.116
Ah, I need the money.

19:25.830 --> 19:27.821
-Wait. For what?
-For what?

19:27.910 --> 19:29.320
You can't buy squat with smiles.

19:29.960 --> 19:33.032
Oh, my God. You gave Uncle Jack
money again, didn't you?

19:33.130 --> 19:36.497
Eh, he's got some cockamamy idea.
I don't know.

19:36.590 --> 19:39.878
He has a lot of business ideas, right?
They're all called "drinking."

19:39.970 --> 19:41.176
Both he and grandpa.

19:41.840 --> 19:44.673
-What is this?
-Oh, this?

19:44.760 --> 19:47.172
Well, you see, you put worms
on the end of the hook,

19:47.260 --> 19:49.137
and then you put that in the water,
and you--

19:49.230 --> 19:51.050
--Fucking smart-ass, this one.

19:51.140 --> 19:53.802
We're leaving for a fishing trip
after we drop off your table.

19:53.900 --> 19:55.765
Thank you for getting him
out of the house.

19:55.860 --> 19:57.179
Oh. Here it comes.

19:57.270 --> 19:59.397
- My mathlete son.

19:59.490 --> 20:01.776
I mean, you do realize
you have to stand in a river

20:01.860 --> 20:03.521
for hours in rubber coveralls?

20:03.610 --> 20:05.441
-They're called waders.
-They're called waders.

20:05.530 --> 20:07.521
- Oh. Whatever.

20:07.620 --> 20:08.689
So is this it?

20:08.790 --> 20:10.189
'Cause we're gonna go back
to your place

20:10.290 --> 20:11.826
-and then get on the road.
-Hang on.

20:11.910 --> 20:13.571
-Ma, I will do it.
-Hang on.

20:14.420 --> 20:16.411
Oh, my God. She's out of her mind.

20:17.590 --> 20:18.579
Ma?

20:19.590 --> 20:21.797
- Okay, don't put any weight on it.

20:21.880 --> 20:24.041
- I'm gonna call the ER, okay?
- I'm okay.

20:24.130 --> 20:26.291
Come on. Give me your arm.
All right.

20:26.390 --> 20:27.539
- Ready? One, two...

20:27.640 --> 20:29.926
-Okay. Okay. You drive.
-Yeah.

20:30.020 --> 20:32.056
- Just watch her leg...

20:32.140 --> 20:34.688
Watch her leg. Here we go. Easy.

21:09.850 --> 21:12.466
_ - Hello?
- J0in me downstairs for a drink.

21:14.560 --> 21:15.720
Uh...

21:16.560 --> 21:20.018
Isn't... Isn't the, um,
lounge closed?

21:20.110 --> 21:22.271
- Not to us.

21:22.980 --> 21:25.232
Okay. See you in a bit.

21:31.120 --> 21:32.985
To a winning round of golf.

21:33.830 --> 21:35.741
-I picked a good partner.
-Yeah.

21:36.750 --> 21:37.819
Mmm.

21:39.630 --> 21:42.793
This Cognac is, uh, $175 a drink.

21:42.880 --> 21:45.508
I... I have a feeling this is about
more than golf.

21:48.260 --> 21:50.717
I admire the way
you never suffer bullshit, Marty.

21:51.890 --> 21:53.130
Or feed it.

21:53.850 --> 21:55.169
You nor Wendy.

21:55.730 --> 21:57.880
Who, by the way, Elena adores.

21:58.440 --> 22:00.180
I think she's gonna leave me for her.

22:00.270 --> 22:02.647
--I wouldn't be surprised.

22:02.730 --> 22:05.062
You know,
Wendy talked to her about what happened.

22:06.320 --> 22:07.856
-The accident.
-Yeah.

22:08.820 --> 22:10.811
We went through something similar.

22:11.660 --> 22:12.979
It really shook us.

22:14.410 --> 22:15.399
I'm sorry.

22:15.950 --> 22:17.781
I don't like to talk about it much, but...

22:17.870 --> 22:20.498
you know, there's always
some idiot saying,

22:20.580 --> 22:24.755
"I know how you feel,"
or... "Everything happens for a reason."

22:29.470 --> 22:31.256
I know you're reticent, but...

22:33.390 --> 22:34.800
I need you to work for me.

22:38.980 --> 22:40.345
To clean your money.

22:42.230 --> 22:47.816
You will be able to earn enough to afford
your great-great—grandkids' tuition.

22:48.320 --> 22:49.730
You know how it works.

22:50.610 --> 22:52.817
You think your life
is going one way, and...

22:53.330 --> 22:55.480
then you look over here
and it's different.

22:56.370 --> 22:59.862
Like that, in the blink of an eye,
it changes.

22:59.960 --> 23:03.373
-Grab what you can while you can.
-I, just, uh...

23:04.000 --> 23:05.126
You know...

23:06.340 --> 23:07.910
What? The risks?

23:10.630 --> 23:13.178
-Yes.
-Well, I understand,

23:13.260 --> 23:16.673
but you only really have to worry about
the risks if you are careless or dumb.

23:16.770 --> 23:19.887
And you're neither. Let me be frank.

23:19.980 --> 23:23.472
My boss tasked me to find
a pristine money guy.

23:24.190 --> 23:27.569
So whoever I choose... can be a risk.

23:31.400 --> 23:32.810
Who's your boss?

23:35.490 --> 23:37.287
You have a pretty good idea, I'm sure.

23:41.960 --> 23:46.078
There's top firms that deal
with discreet clients all the time and--

23:46.170 --> 23:48.627
I took that portfolio to 50 investors.

23:48.710 --> 23:51.759
Either they didn't catch any discrepancy

23:51.840 --> 23:54.502
or they were just too fucking scared to...
to speak up.

23:55.890 --> 24:00.338
I need someone who's not just brilliant,
but who also has integrity.

24:00.430 --> 24:04.514
Because integrity, my friend...
is the shield to greed and vanity.

24:06.110 --> 24:08.567
Well, you want somebody
with integrity to do a job

24:08.650 --> 24:10.641
where they have to discard their ethics.

24:10.740 --> 24:12.947
Are you talking about societal ethics
or your own?

24:13.030 --> 24:15.021
Well, probably both. You know...

24:15.530 --> 24:20.320
-people live in a social contract, right?
-Okay. So then what job would you take?

24:20.410 --> 24:22.492
-Big Tobacco?
-No.

24:23.080 --> 24:24.411
JP Morgan?

24:26.380 --> 24:27.836
What's the difference?

24:29.760 --> 24:33.161
The latter plays in a market
that already exists.

24:33.260 --> 24:36.844
So you're saying... that because
you're not necessarily the manufacturer,

24:36.930 --> 24:39.387
you can see a way around
the clash of ethics?

24:39.470 --> 24:43.884
I would contend that this _is a little bit
more of a complex issue.

24:43.980 --> 24:45.265
Okay, fair enough.

24:45.350 --> 24:47.898
So let's say
there wasn't a social contract.

24:49.320 --> 24:50.856
What are your ethics?

24:52.030 --> 24:54.942
The one thing that trumps all the others?

24:56.030 --> 24:59.534
-To protect and provide for my family.
-Exactly.

24:59.620 --> 25:01.827
You will be able to provide.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.706
More than you can possibly dream.

25:06.120 --> 25:09.453
Because you are the best
I've ever seen, Marty.

25:10.800 --> 25:13.758
And we will protect you.
But there's one thing I ask.

25:15.630 --> 25:17.586
-No Bruce.
-Bruce?

25:18.300 --> 25:21.758
Bruce started the company.
Bruce is my best friend since college.

25:21.850 --> 25:26.014
And, you know, I bet you the thing
that bothers you about people like Bruce,

25:26.100 --> 25:29.228
uh, is the same thing
that John Q. Public needs

25:29.310 --> 25:30.971
to feel confident to give him his money.

25:31.070 --> 25:34.187
And I would need those funds
to wash anything with zero detection.

25:34.900 --> 25:39.269
Besides, he... he wouldn't have any reason
to deal with your accounts at all.

25:39.370 --> 25:42.783
So add loyalty to friends
as a personal ethic, huh?

25:43.750 --> 25:44.956
Yeah.

25:45.830 --> 25:49.709
Is it me or do you sound like
someone who wants the gig?

25:50.250 --> 25:51.660
No.

25:51.750 --> 25:54.332
That's just the way my brain works.
Just playing out the scenario.

26:00.470 --> 26:03.769
In another world... possibly.

26:04.470 --> 26:07.132
But in this world, the...
the one that's reality...

26:09.270 --> 26:11.397
Wendy would never go for it.

26:15.280 --> 26:18.022
And I can respect that. Trust me.

26:23.790 --> 26:24.859
Cheers.

26:32.750 --> 26:35.048
Louis Zehner, 37, from Evanston,

26:35.130 --> 26:37.963
moving millions in and out
of shell companies overseas.

26:38.050 --> 26:40.962
-Terrorism? _
-It's more than likely drug-related, Sir.

26:41.050 --> 26:44.713
Oh, Jesus. Look...
we're going after bin Laden.

26:45.560 --> 26:47.721
There's a dealer every three blocks
in this city.

26:47.810 --> 26:51.803
No one is fighting a war on drugs anymore.
All right? Just work the banking.

26:51.900 --> 26:55.279
Money guys like Zehner
are the way to get to the kingpins.

26:55.360 --> 26:57.396
Just do your fucking job, Agent Petty.

26:59.240 --> 27:00.104
You...

27:02.370 --> 27:03.689
I'm just a fucking accountant.

27:04.200 --> 27:06.532
- You're not just an accountant.

27:06.620 --> 27:10.909
-Scotty, did you get my prescription?
-Yeah, it's on top of the microwave.

27:14.460 --> 27:18.544
Maybe it's not just work
that's causing the stress.

27:19.630 --> 27:21.040
Well...

27:21.130 --> 27:23.849
-Does it bother you that she's still here?
-No.

27:23.930 --> 27:26.967
No, I just... I know how you two are
with each other sometimes.

27:27.060 --> 27:29.301
Well, I mean, she either recovers here

27:29.390 --> 27:32.939
or flops around at her place.
And then I have to check on her every day.

27:33.650 --> 27:34.969
Every day?

27:35.070 --> 27:37.561
-Every other day.
-Oh, okay.

27:38.860 --> 27:41.101
I'm just saying,
you're shouldering a lot right now.

27:41.200 --> 27:44.317
No. No, it's just...
This is not what I pictured

27:44.410 --> 27:46.571
when I wanted to be a federal agent.

27:47.490 --> 27:48.479
Okay.

27:50.830 --> 27:51.956
I'm...

27:52.870 --> 27:57.079
I'm in Chicago, for fuck's sake.
There is so much more I could be doing.

27:57.170 --> 28:00.219
-Well, then transfer.
-It's not that easy.

28:00.300 --> 28:03.588
Why not?
I mean, life is too short to be miserable.

28:03.680 --> 28:06.092
And too short for you
to have to hear about it every day?

28:06.180 --> 28:07.920
Yeah.

28:08.010 --> 28:10.558
- Thank you so much, Scotty.
- How are you feeling, Ma?

28:10.640 --> 28:13.302
Much better. _
I'll be out of your hair in no time.

28:19.650 --> 28:21.311
Why are you putting on makeup?

28:21.400 --> 28:24.608
Because Mommy has a job interview.
Go into my closet and get my boots,

28:24.700 --> 28:26.656
-next to my sneakers. Thank you.
-Okay.

28:30.790 --> 28:33.111
That's it. Right there, sweetheart.
Perfect.

28:33.210 --> 28:35.371
--Thank you. Thank you, sweetheart.

28:35.880 --> 28:37.450
What's a job interview?

28:38.130 --> 28:41.793
A job interview is when...
It's when we...

28:41.880 --> 28:44.792
When Mommy goes and she meets someone,
and they ask her a lot of questions,

28:44.890 --> 28:48.212
like, where did she go to school
and where she worked before.

28:48.300 --> 28:50.712
And they would be absolute morons
not to hire you.

28:50.810 --> 28:52.425
And if they like Mommy,

28:52.520 --> 28:54.511
they will give her money
to work with them.

28:55.310 --> 28:57.801
But if you get a job,
you won't be here as much.

28:58.480 --> 28:59.777
Oh, sweetheart...

29:01.030 --> 29:02.520
I will always be here for you.

29:02.610 --> 29:04.771
Even if you can't just
reach out and touch me,

29:04.860 --> 29:08.114
you can always call me
and I will always call you back. Okay?

29:12.160 --> 29:14.151
--Such a mommy's girl.

29:14.250 --> 29:15.490
Okay, I need your help today.

29:15.580 --> 29:17.241
You're gonna have
to look after Daddy, all right?

29:17.330 --> 29:19.286
Make sure that he's really good
with Jonah.

29:19.380 --> 29:20.369
Okay.

29:20.460 --> 29:21.540
-You got this.
-Okay.

29:21.630 --> 29:22.836
-Okay? Love you, too.
-I love you.

29:22.920 --> 29:24.251
- Bye.

29:37.270 --> 29:40.182
- Right here. Right here!
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

29:40.270 --> 29:41.726
Fine. Here.

29:41.820 --> 29:43.139
I'll come pick you up. What time?

29:43.230 --> 29:45.482
I don't know. I'll manage.

29:47.160 --> 29:49.367
- Love you.

29:59.130 --> 30:00.336
- Hi.
- Hey, girl.

30:00.420 --> 30:02.206
-Hey. Uh...
-Come on in.

30:27.610 --> 30:30.773
-Do I know you, man?
-Tell my mom to come outside.

30:30.870 --> 30:32.735
I'll call when I leave!

30:37.000 --> 30:40.743
-Mom. What the fuck?
-Jesus! Get the fuck out of here!

30:40.830 --> 30:42.331
No. Give me that fucking shit.

30:42.420 --> 30:44.411
No, stop it!

30:45.170 --> 30:46.797
--Oh, fuck!

30:51.890 --> 30:52.959
Wait. Where do you keep it?

30:54.680 --> 30:57.308
God, stop it! Stop it!

30:59.560 --> 31:01.050
- Jesus!
- Wait!

31:02.980 --> 31:05.722
- Stay the fuck away from me.
- Hey. Stop.

31:09.450 --> 31:10.439
Wait! Just stop!

31:10.530 --> 31:12.486
You fucking touch me again,
so help me God,

31:12.570 --> 31:14.947
I'll tell your bosses you assaulted me.

31:15.040 --> 31:18.532
-What the fuck is wrong with you?
-You! Stay the fuck away from me!

31:19.870 --> 31:21.201
Fuck!

31:30.470 --> 31:32.540
Okay, you ready?
Time for bed. Let's go.

31:32.640 --> 31:35.507
- No, just one more?
- Mm-mm.

31:35.600 --> 31:38.808
But I'm thirsty. I need water.

31:38.890 --> 31:42.018
Well, what's that got to do
with cartoons, huh?

31:42.100 --> 31:44.182
You want me to get you
some water, sweetheart?

31:44.270 --> 31:46.477
We can read a story before bed.

31:47.110 --> 31:48.771
I want Daddy to do it.

31:50.860 --> 31:53.567
Daddy'll do it. Let's go.
Right.

31:54.160 --> 31:56.776
- Whee!
- Good night, Mommy.

31:56.870 --> 31:58.326
Night-night.

32:14.430 --> 32:15.795
There you are.

32:33.820 --> 32:36.277
I want you to know, I'm getting better.
I am.

32:38.080 --> 32:41.538
And... I know I'm...

32:41.620 --> 32:43.360
I'm very aware that I've been...

32:44.750 --> 32:46.957
distant from the kids, and from you.

32:47.040 --> 32:50.874
Ijust... I can't...
I can't shake this feeling.

33:00.470 --> 33:02.518
Did you know I used to break
into houses as a kid?

33:04.850 --> 33:05.930
You what?

33:06.850 --> 33:07.976
Mmm.

33:08.810 --> 33:11.392
I mean, I wouldn't...
I wouldn't take anything. I just, I'd...

33:13.570 --> 33:16.357
I'd have a beer or two.
So I guess I did...

33:17.120 --> 33:19.270
I guess I did take those, but...

33:19.990 --> 33:21.571
God, it was so liberating.

33:22.330 --> 33:24.241
Just feeling like someone else.

33:25.330 --> 33:26.160
Iwould...

33:26.250 --> 33:30.994
I would stretch out, I'd stretch out
on these big, wrap-around couches, and...

33:31.090 --> 33:32.375
God, I'd feel the...

33:32.460 --> 33:35.258
just this clean fabric underneath my...

33:35.340 --> 33:38.548
my arms and my legs,
and, oh, my God, it was just...

33:38.640 --> 33:40.255
it was so comfortable.

33:44.640 --> 33:48.849
And... And then I'd be hit with the hard
reality that I didn't belong there.

33:53.110 --> 33:54.896
I just didn't belong there.

33:56.280 --> 33:58.851
And so I'd...
I'd act out a little bit. I'd...

34:01.370 --> 34:03.941
I'd move picture frames around, I'd...

34:06.410 --> 34:12.292
I'd turn toothbrushes upside down.
I'd put blue food coloring in the milk.

34:17.970 --> 34:20.097
And for some reason, lately...

34:22.100 --> 34:24.056
...that's how I've been feeling.

34:26.270 --> 34:27.760
Just like a fraud.

34:29.520 --> 34:31.852
And that's been happening
since before the accident.

34:31.940 --> 34:34.898
Which is okay. I mean, I've been able
to handle that, because...

34:35.650 --> 34:38.198
I always knew I took
really good fucking care of my kids,

34:38.280 --> 34:39.690
and now, I can't even do that.

34:39.780 --> 34:42.943
And I'm... I'm just in my head
all the time, and...

34:43.030 --> 34:48.241
I'm just... I'm just a big, fat...
existential mess.

34:55.710 --> 34:58.087
Hey. Do you wanna go somewhere?

34:59.180 --> 35:01.751
-Where_?
-On vacation.

35:02.220 --> 35:03.426
On our budget?

35:04.850 --> 35:08.092
I had a potential client come in
a little while ago,

35:08.180 --> 35:11.308
and he has resorts all over,
and he offered a trip.

35:12.310 --> 35:14.722
Well, it sounds like
there are strings attached.

35:14.820 --> 35:15.935
--No.

35:16.030 --> 35:18.737
-It's a thank you.
-For?

35:18.820 --> 35:20.356
I looked through his portfolio.

35:21.950 --> 35:25.022
So why is this potential client
not an actual client?

35:26.830 --> 35:31.608
Well, he says that he is in tile,
and I don't know if he is. I don't...

35:31.710 --> 35:35.669
I don't know if it's, you know,
Corleone with olive oil... I don't know.

35:35.750 --> 35:37.911
So, what,
are you saying this guy's in the Mob?

35:38.010 --> 35:41.047
I don't know what the hell he is.
But it's... it's honestly a thank you.

35:41.130 --> 35:43.963
And, um, the amount of money I saved him,

35:44.050 --> 35:46.348
the trip would just be
a drop in the bucket.

35:47.100 --> 35:50.137
And what are you gonna do
when he asks you to work for him again?

35:52.350 --> 35:56.184
I'll give him my best
Bartleby impersonation, and I'll say,

35:56.270 --> 35:57.726
"I prefer not to."

35:59.530 --> 36:01.486
Come on. We need a vacation.

36:01.570 --> 36:03.811
If he asks me to look through
his portfolio once in a while,

36:03.910 --> 36:05.229
what's the big deal?

36:06.330 --> 36:10.573
Didn't you always want me
to be more spontaneous?

36:10.660 --> 36:13.117
- Hmm? This is it.
- Mmm.

36:13.750 --> 36:15.240
Come on. Say yes.

36:16.790 --> 36:19.452
-It could be fun.
-Yeah, it could.

36:23.720 --> 36:27.178
-Don't get caught, dude.
-Then don't say anything.

36:28.350 --> 36:30.420
So what is it you do for Del, exactly?

36:31.270 --> 36:33.682
-Huh?
-What do you do for Del?

36:34.140 --> 36:37.519
Don't we all do the same shit? Hmm?

36:37.610 --> 36:41.489
Put the money
through the fucking washer?

36:51.700 --> 36:53.656
Remind me to never doubt your instincts.

36:54.620 --> 36:58.829
Oh. Well, it didn't take any instinct
to not mix vodka and Scotch, buddy.

36:58.920 --> 37:01.582
I'm not talking about that, dude.
I'm talking about Del.

37:01.670 --> 37:02.967
Oh. Him.

37:04.170 --> 37:05.421
I don't know.

37:06.640 --> 37:08.881
-You don't know what?
-You know.

37:08.970 --> 37:11.211
Whoa, you're not really thinking
of doing this, are you?

37:11.310 --> 37:13.801
Uh, no, no. I mean, not really, but...

37:15.230 --> 37:17.050
But... but what?

37:19.360 --> 37:23.069
Hypothetically speaking, that's...
that's what I do.

37:23.150 --> 37:25.857
I move money through accounts.
I already do it, you know?

37:25.950 --> 37:27.315
-Right.
-And... and...

37:27.410 --> 37:29.230
there's no way we'd get caught
unless someone,

37:29.330 --> 37:31.321
i.e., you, ran their mouth.

37:31.410 --> 37:32.650
-Oh, oh, me?
-Right.

37:32.750 --> 37:33.944
Really? Are you kidding me?

37:34.040 --> 37:36.611
I know what cartels do.
I've fucking seen Traffic.

37:36.710 --> 37:39.497
You kidding me?
Listen, I'm... I'm down for whatever.

37:39.590 --> 37:41.990
All right? But it really doesn't matter
because you have this kind of

37:42.090 --> 37:44.797
remarkable habit of telling
your wife everything.

37:44.880 --> 37:47.292
-And she'll never go for it.
-That's what I told him.

37:47.390 --> 37:48.539
You can keep it from her,

37:48.640 --> 37:51.848
but eventually she's gonna notice
the extra zeros in the bank account.

37:51.930 --> 37:54.922
All right? Bloody Mary bar. Sweet.

37:58.650 --> 38:01.517
Hello, hello. How are you feeling?

38:01.610 --> 38:05.353
-Like I'm about to go on tour.
-The back bedroom is all set up.

38:05.450 --> 38:07.691
Mm. Does he still snore
like a baby dinosaur?

38:08.860 --> 38:11.192
Ma, you can sleep outside in our tent,
if you want.

38:11.280 --> 38:12.941
I put some earplugs on your nightstand.

38:13.040 --> 38:14.860
Oh, hey,
where should I put your prescription?

38:14.950 --> 38:18.363
In the trash. I'll be fine with ibuprofen.

38:18.460 --> 38:20.872
What I really need is a porcelain toilet.

38:21.710 --> 38:24.372
IfI see a bedpan again, I'm gonna scream.

38:24.460 --> 38:27.873
Ma, I... uh, okay.
I put bars up in there for you.

38:27.970 --> 38:30.712
And don't forget the doctor said
to keep it elevated.

38:31.890 --> 38:33.676
-It's nice here.
-Mm-hmm.

38:33.760 --> 38:35.136
Hola, day spa.
How can I help you?

38:37.310 --> 38:38.595
You know, uh...

38:40.230 --> 38:44.314
Del made me a very generous offer
to work for him,

38:44.400 --> 38:46.812
and it's exactly what we thought it was.

38:48.320 --> 38:51.778
Well, we knew that was probably
gonna happen. You tell him no?

38:54.160 --> 38:54.979
Marty?

38:56.790 --> 38:57.609
What'd you say?

38:58.330 --> 39:01.743
Iturned him down. I mean, you know...

39:02.500 --> 39:03.785
No, I don't know.

39:06.260 --> 39:08.080
There something you wanna discuss?

39:09.260 --> 39:10.966
No. I don't think so.

39:11.510 --> 39:12.386
You sure?

39:13.430 --> 39:14.499
I don't know.

39:15.680 --> 39:19.013
I would do it... really well.

39:19.100 --> 39:20.647
Well, of course you would.

39:21.650 --> 39:24.266
- The offer's great.
- Well, I'm sure that it is.

39:24.360 --> 39:27.898
But this... this isn't anything
we can really consider, is it?

39:27.990 --> 39:30.276
Probably not, but, uh...

39:30.360 --> 39:32.237
nothing wrong
with talking about it, right?

39:32.320 --> 39:33.617
Just talking.

39:36.990 --> 39:40.039
Okay. Have at it, "Just Talking."

39:40.580 --> 39:42.787
Play it out. Name the pros.

39:42.880 --> 39:44.836
Well, look, I mean, the money, obviously.

39:44.920 --> 39:46.740
-Mm-hmm. _
-I could really grow the busmess.

39:46.840 --> 39:49.411
I could trade at the level
I've always wanted.

39:49.510 --> 39:51.421
Okay. So how much money
are we talking about?

39:52.390 --> 39:55.291
I mean, no one's gonna mistake me
for Warren Buffet, but, Wendy...

39:57.810 --> 39:58.959
We'd be good.

40:01.270 --> 40:02.510
Good as in...?

40:03.440 --> 40:07.479
As in never, ever having to worry
about money again.

40:10.240 --> 40:11.059
Ever.

40:12.150 --> 40:13.151
Wow.

40:18.370 --> 40:19.325
Cons?

40:20.000 --> 40:21.115
- Jail.
- Mm.

40:21.710 --> 40:24.167
Leaving your family,
pissing off a cartel.

40:24.790 --> 40:27.418
Those things would never happen.

40:28.630 --> 40:32.088
And I wouldn't be a mule.
I wouldn't be a dealer.

40:32.170 --> 40:35.173
I'd be just pushing my mouse
around my desk.

40:36.010 --> 40:37.637
What does Bruce think?

40:37.720 --> 40:39.381
Get this. With all of his bravado,

40:39.470 --> 40:42.633
he was counting on you
shutting it down instantly.

40:42.730 --> 40:46.109
Well, he doesn't know me like you do.

40:46.190 --> 40:48.431
Mm-mm. He doesn't.

40:50.070 --> 40:53.312
Well, even if you...
if we did do this, I mean...

40:53.990 --> 40:56.276
-it's not like you'd be stealing.
-That's right.

40:56.910 --> 40:58.070
I wouldn't.

41:07.080 --> 41:09.128
We can't... We can't do this.

41:10.170 --> 41:12.411
-Can we?
-Why can't we do it?

41:15.840 --> 41:17.501
You really gonna do this?

41:20.680 --> 41:22.056
Are we gonna do this?

41:27.560 --> 41:28.549
Well...

41:32.650 --> 41:34.356
I'm good with it if you are.

41:36.530 --> 41:37.690
Same here.

41:39.030 --> 41:40.827
Then I guess we're really gonna do this.

41:41.490 --> 41:42.991
-Yeah?
-Hmm?

41:43.080 --> 41:45.150
-We're gonna do it?
-Mm.

41:47.500 --> 41:48.819
-Hmm?
-Mm.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.206
I guess so.

41:53.420 --> 41:54.580
Yeah.

41:56.970 --> 41:57.959
Okay.

42:15.900 --> 42:17.652
-Ma.
-Yeah?

42:17.740 --> 42:21.119
Please, take these.
Just so you can sleep.

42:21.200 --> 42:24.988
- I don't need 'em.
- I know you're tough, Ma.

42:25.080 --> 42:28.493
Everyone in this world knows you're tough.
You don't have to prove anything here.

42:28.580 --> 42:31.242
I said no. I don't want them.

42:32.090 --> 42:34.797
- Look, there's no prizes for suffering.

42:34.880 --> 42:37.007
--You just feel shitty.

42:37.090 --> 42:39.422
And I hate seeing you like this. Please...

42:40.050 --> 42:42.757
until you feel better, please...

42:44.310 --> 42:45.299
For me.

42:48.850 --> 42:51.603
-Just this once.
-Here, here, here.

43:12.080 --> 43:13.627
No fucking way!

43:13.710 --> 43:16.508
- I think science would disagree.
- You were in the room.

43:17.130 --> 43:19.166
You heard them say that the...

43:19.260 --> 43:22.593
the chances of us conceiving again
were practically nil.

43:22.680 --> 43:24.921
And I barely made it through
Jonah's pregnancy.

43:26.020 --> 43:27.419
Yeah. I remember.

43:31.270 --> 43:32.510
What are you thinking?

43:32.610 --> 43:34.601
That I'd like to do
whatever you want to do.

43:34.690 --> 43:35.930
-Oh, come on.
-It's true.

43:36.030 --> 43:38.180
Come on, that's not fair.
This is not Switzerland.

43:38.280 --> 43:40.908
You can't stay neutral here.
I want your input.

43:40.990 --> 43:43.117
Well, financially speaking, Wendy...

43:43.200 --> 43:45.020
...it could be tough.

43:45.120 --> 43:48.783
No, I know. I mean,
I don't actually see how'd we manage.

43:48.870 --> 43:53.204
But, uh,
we said the same thing with Jonah.

43:53.290 --> 43:55.793
-And could you even imagine?
-Oh, God, no.

43:55.880 --> 43:56.949
-No.
-So...

43:59.670 --> 44:00.876
So...

44:02.050 --> 44:04.132
So you're saying you want to have it?

44:05.010 --> 44:06.056
I didn't say that.

44:06.140 --> 44:09.052
I'm saying that if we did decide to do it,
that we could make it work.

44:09.140 --> 44:11.131
No, of course. Of course. I know.

44:11.230 --> 44:15.223
I mean, if we did have this baby,
would I ever go back to work again?

44:15.310 --> 44:16.891
I just don't see how that could happen.

44:16.980 --> 44:19.733
And that's just something I...
I need to do.

44:19.820 --> 44:22.027
Yeah. You should. You have every right to.

44:22.820 --> 44:24.811
But then, on the other hand,
what if we, you know,

44:24.910 --> 44:27.151
go down the road five years,
we look at each other and say,

44:27.240 --> 44:29.071
"God, we should... we should've done it."

44:29.160 --> 44:30.491
Mm.

44:30.580 --> 44:33.287
What if this baby would grow up
to cure cancer or something?

44:33.370 --> 44:35.167
You hear stories like that all the time.

44:35.250 --> 44:38.413
All those _stories_ about
all those babies curing cancer.

44:38.500 --> 44:40.502
-No, you know what I mean.
-There's like 12 of them.

44:40.590 --> 44:43.252
People who say
that they were an accident.

44:44.180 --> 44:45.795
I mean, hell, I was an accident.

44:53.640 --> 44:57.098
Would I be a terrible person
if I said I didn't wanna have this baby?

44:57.190 --> 45:00.318
No, sweetheart.
You'd never be a terrible person.

45:02.240 --> 45:04.447
Just... You know,
everything would change again.

45:04.530 --> 45:08.364
I was just feeling like
my feet were back on the ground.

45:08.450 --> 45:12.159
Well, theoretically speaking, uh,
any decision that's ever made,

45:12.250 --> 45:13.786
no matter how small,

45:13.870 --> 45:18.125
uh, can potentially elicit a huge change
around the world.

45:20.380 --> 45:22.416
You take Mr. Buddy Holly, for example.

45:24.300 --> 45:26.177
When you say goodbye

45:26.260 --> 45:30.708
Yes, that'll be the day
When you make me cry

45:30.810 --> 45:33.267
- You say you're gonna leave...
-Ah, fuck!

45:34.980 --> 45:36.015
Marty, watch out.

46:06.380 --> 46:08.382
--Hey.

46:08.470 --> 46:09.755
Hey.

46:09.850 --> 46:13.388
Uh, so, hey, um... we're in.

46:15.730 --> 46:17.550
This calls for a drink.

46:20.440 --> 46:23.728
Oh, and, uh... Louis?

46:24.730 --> 46:26.948
Your services are no longer needed.

46:27.030 --> 46:30.022
-What are you talking about? Del? Del?
-I didn't know I was taking his job.

46:30.120 --> 46:32.190
No. Louis wasn't gonna be
hanging around much anyway,

46:32.280 --> 46:33.986
because he's a cheat.

46:34.080 --> 46:38.164
He cheats on his wife and in business.
He even cheats in golf.

46:38.960 --> 46:41.167
And cheaters eventually get caught.

46:41.250 --> 46:42.740
I don't know what you're talking about.

46:43.300 --> 46:45.621
And it's become clear to me...

46:46.300 --> 46:49.212
the very real possibility
that you've been working with the feds.

46:49.300 --> 46:52.599
I swear on my fucking son's life,
I didn't talk to any--

46:52.680 --> 46:54.716
Stop! Stop.

46:55.470 --> 46:57.518
See, Louis, I'm a believer

46:57.600 --> 47:01.513
that there are times when things
are related in the universe.

47:01.940 --> 47:04.226
What do they call it in that movie
with the dinosaurs?

47:04.320 --> 47:05.856
Ah, right. Chaos.

47:06.440 --> 47:09.273
You see, the feds were snooping around,

47:09.360 --> 47:14.150
which caused you to make some
piss-poor attempt to cover your tracks.

47:14.240 --> 47:17.744
Which allowed a shrewd person
like Marty Byrde

47:17.830 --> 47:21.163
to identify your shoddy work
and thieving ways.

47:21.250 --> 47:25.163
Which then inspires me
to pursue Mr. Byrde,

47:25.250 --> 47:28.913
and this allows me to dispense with you.
Isn't that something, huh?

47:29.010 --> 47:32.969
The wonderful convergence
between cause and effect,

47:33.050 --> 47:34.677
and a bit of good luck.

47:36.390 --> 47:38.346
Bad luck in your case, Louis.

47:40.810 --> 47:44.359
The universe is a funny, funny place

47:44.440 --> 47:46.977
-with all of its... chaos.
-No, no, no!

48:07.550 --> 48:10.713
Oh, God! Jesus Christ!

48:18.560 --> 48:19.925
What d'you want me to do with 'em?

48:22.310 --> 48:24.141
Save them for a rainy day.

48:36.870 --> 48:40.954
You don't know how wonderful it is
to have someone on board that I can trust.
