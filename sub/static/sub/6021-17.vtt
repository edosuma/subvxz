00:05.905 --> 00:07.338
-You hanging out?
-Yeah, yeah.

00:51.017 --> 00:54.453
Hello? Hello?

00:54.754 --> 00:55.778
You're bad, huh?

00:55.955 --> 00:59.254
I'd like to see you come up here
and say that to my face.

01:12.272 --> 01:15.241
So, what's the deal with politics?

01:15.809 --> 01:18.277
I don't get it. Am I right, people?

01:32.192 --> 01:34.524
I don't believe this.

01:45.371 --> 01:47.771
I read somewhere
that this Brentano's is the place...

01:47.941 --> 01:49.238
...to meet girls in New York.

01:49.409 --> 01:53.038
First it was the health club, then
the supermarket, now the bookstore.

01:53.213 --> 01:56.148
They can put it anywhere they want.
No one's meeting anybody.

01:57.350 --> 02:00.012
Jerry, look at all
these pagodas, huh?

02:00.186 --> 02:03.553
I gotta get over to Hong Kong
before it all goes back to China.

02:03.723 --> 02:05.850
You better hurry.

02:06.025 --> 02:07.322
I'm gonna hit the head.

02:07.827 --> 02:11.024
Boy, look at this.
Hong Kong's outlawed the rickshaw.

02:11.197 --> 02:13.392
I thought those would be perfect
for New York.

02:13.566 --> 02:17.525
Yes. The city needs more
slow moving wicker vehicles.

02:24.477 --> 02:26.377
Well, Elaine's been to Hong Kong.

02:26.579 --> 02:27.705
I should give her a call.

02:27.881 --> 02:29.815
She's at that annual
Peterman party tonight.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.644
The one she danced at last year.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.615
No, that wasn't dancing.

02:34.187 --> 02:35.552
Hey, there's Leo.

02:35.722 --> 02:37.815
-Oh, who's Leo?
-Uncle Leo.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.755
Oh, yeah, right. Uncle Leo.

02:41.194 --> 02:43.389
Forgot his first name.

02:46.266 --> 02:48.427
Did I just see that?

02:49.769 --> 02:52.829
Well, that ought to keep you busy
for a couple of days, huh?

02:56.876 --> 03:00.107
So, Elaine, are you gonna dance
this year?

03:00.914 --> 03:03.906
Maybe. All over your face.

03:07.253 --> 03:09.517
If you do dance,
the cooks wanna know,

03:09.689 --> 03:11.589
so they can be brought out
of the kitchen.

03:11.758 --> 03:13.191
They missed it last year.

03:16.963 --> 03:18.897
My friends, a toast.

03:19.065 --> 03:23.365
As the woolly-haired Melanesians
of Papua New Guinea once said:

03:29.309 --> 03:31.277
All right. Who's dancing?

03:32.412 --> 03:36.781
No? All right, I'll just have
to get things started.

03:46.926 --> 03:48.086
Hi, I'm Zach.

03:48.294 --> 03:50.592
Hi. I'm miserable.

03:59.939 --> 04:02.305
Excuse me, sir.
What are you doing?

04:03.409 --> 04:05.036
I'm all set.

04:06.012 --> 04:08.913
Did you take that book with you
into the bathroom?

04:11.851 --> 04:13.751
What do you want to hear?

04:16.154 --> 04:19.283
They made me buy it.
A hundred bucks, this thing cost me.

04:19.459 --> 04:20.983
How dare they.

04:21.160 --> 04:25.153
I got news for you. If it wasn't
for the toilet, there would be no books.

04:25.331 --> 04:29.165
Yeah, I understand Gutenberg used
to spend a fair amount of time in there.

04:29.335 --> 04:31.462
They're selling coffee, bran muffins.

04:31.638 --> 04:33.538
You're surrounded
by reading material.

04:33.706 --> 04:35.867
It's entrapment.

04:36.976 --> 04:38.637
<i>"French Impressionist Paintings"?</i>

04:38.811 --> 04:41.644
I find the soothing pastoral images
very conducive--

04:41.814 --> 04:44.476
Thank you very much.

04:44.651 --> 04:48.314
I'm gonna go back there and return it
when there's different people working.

04:48.488 --> 04:51.651
-You wanna catch a movie?
-I can't. I'm meeting Uncle Leo.

04:51.824 --> 04:54.019
I saw him shoplifting
at the bookstore.

04:54.193 --> 04:56.661
All right, Leo. Sticking it to the man.

05:00.933 --> 05:03.834
-Sleeping in the car again?
-Cocktail flu.

05:04.003 --> 05:05.561
Oh, right, the big party.

05:05.738 --> 05:09.765
You didn't dance again, did you?

05:10.476 --> 05:11.943
No.

05:12.111 --> 05:15.444
I found a better way
to humiliate myself.

05:15.948 --> 05:18.815
There was this guy
and we had a few too many.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.646
-You went home with him?
-Worse.

05:20.820 --> 05:25.120
We made out at the table
like our plane was going down.

05:26.726 --> 05:29.923
Oh, the drunken make-out.
An office classic.

05:30.096 --> 05:32.428
Did you end up Xeroxing anything?

05:32.598 --> 05:36.329
Do you know how embarrassing
this is to someone in my position?

05:36.502 --> 05:40.165
-What is your position?
-I'm an associate.

05:40.340 --> 05:43.332
-Hey, me too.
-Yeah, me too.

05:44.610 --> 05:47.272
Oh, God. Why did I do this?

05:47.447 --> 05:50.143
Now, I'm the office skank.

05:50.950 --> 05:53.248
Well, unless, you tell everybody
you're dating.

05:53.419 --> 05:55.910
Oh, right.

05:56.089 --> 05:58.922
Because if we're dating,
what everyone saw was just...

05:59.092 --> 06:02.584
...a beautiful moment
between two lovers.

06:02.762 --> 06:07.096
As opposed to a spirited bout
of skanko Roman wrestling.

06:09.268 --> 06:10.530
Bravo.

06:16.109 --> 06:20.637
Oh, hey. Can I fix you fellas
some drinks and sandwiches?

06:20.813 --> 06:21.871
No, we've already eaten.

06:22.048 --> 06:24.346
But you can clear
some of this stuff out of the way.

06:24.517 --> 06:26.144
Jerry, check this out.

06:26.319 --> 06:28.651
Remember my idea
about rickshaws in New York?

06:28.821 --> 06:32.382
-Well, we're gonna make it happen.
-No, you're not.

06:32.558 --> 06:35.618
Well, Newman, he knows a guy
in the Hong Kong post office.

06:35.795 --> 06:37.319
No, he doesn't.

06:37.497 --> 06:39.294
He's shipping a rickshaw.
It can't miss.

06:39.465 --> 06:41.228
Yes, it can.

06:41.401 --> 06:42.595
We'll start out with one.

06:42.769 --> 06:45.203
When it catches on
we're gonna have a whole fleet.

06:45.371 --> 06:47.999
It's the romance of the handsome cab
without the guilt...

06:48.174 --> 06:50.608
...or dander of the equine.

06:51.077 --> 06:53.204
So who's gonna pull this thing?

06:56.182 --> 06:59.151
-Well, I just assumed you would.
-Yeah, but I thought--

07:01.387 --> 07:04.151
My, isn't this an awkward moment?

07:06.526 --> 07:08.892
What about the homeless?

07:09.996 --> 07:11.861
Can't we worry about them later?

07:12.031 --> 07:13.862
To pull the rickshaw.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.659
They have an intimate knowledge
of the street.

07:16.836 --> 07:18.667
Always walking around the city.

07:18.838 --> 07:21.739
Why not just strap
something to them?

07:22.708 --> 07:26.474
Now, that's the first sensible idea
I've heard all day.

07:30.049 --> 07:31.880
Jerry, hello.

07:32.051 --> 07:35.179
So, Leo, how's everything?
You doing okay?

07:35.354 --> 07:38.551
I still have the ringing in the ears.
Sounds like the phone.

07:38.724 --> 07:40.419
Yeah, yeah, but what about money?

07:40.593 --> 07:42.288
Are you strapped?
Do you need a little?

07:42.462 --> 07:45.954
Are you kidding?
I should be loaning you money.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.565
But I'm not.

07:48.801 --> 07:52.464
Leo, I saw you in Brentano's
yesterday.

07:52.638 --> 07:53.798
Why didn't you say hello?

07:53.973 --> 07:56.237
Because you were too busy
stealing a book.

07:56.876 --> 07:59.504
You still say hello.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.345
Oh, I saw you steal.

08:02.515 --> 08:05.313
Oh, they don't care. We all do it.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.645
Who, criminals?

08:06.819 --> 08:10.414
Senior citizens. No big deal.

08:10.590 --> 08:14.822
-You could get arrested.
-Arrested? Come on.

08:15.061 --> 08:18.428
I'm an old man. I'm confused.
I thought I paid for it.

08:18.731 --> 08:20.858
What's my name?
Could you take me home?

08:21.033 --> 08:22.728
Leo.

08:22.902 --> 08:25.837
All right, all right,
Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes.

08:26.005 --> 08:27.870
-You made your point.
-Thank you.

08:28.040 --> 08:31.441
Will somebody answer
that damn phone.

08:33.946 --> 08:35.937
Of course, Zach and l
have been dating.

08:36.115 --> 08:38.345
What did you think?
I was the office skank?

08:38.518 --> 08:39.542
Well....

08:39.719 --> 08:41.914
Well? We've been dating
for three months...

08:42.087 --> 08:45.922
...between you and me
and anyone else you wanna tell.

08:47.860 --> 08:50.124
Oh, man.

08:51.831 --> 08:53.958
-Isn't that Zach?
-Yeah.

08:54.133 --> 08:55.464
Aren't you upset?

08:56.302 --> 09:00.534
Yes. Oh, man.

09:03.576 --> 09:07.034
All right, listen up. Now,
you three have been hand-picked...

09:07.213 --> 09:10.080
...out of possibly dozens
who applied.

09:10.249 --> 09:12.444
Now, what we're looking for
are motivated...

09:12.618 --> 09:17.715
...hard-working, homeless gentlemen,
like yourselves, to pull rickshaws.

09:17.890 --> 09:20.484
Now, I don't care where you're from,
or how you got here...

09:20.660 --> 09:24.824
...or what happened to your homes,
but you will have to be physically fit.

09:26.432 --> 09:27.899
The government.

09:28.434 --> 09:31.528
Because to pull rickshaws
requires more than just strong legs.

09:31.704 --> 09:34.571
You're also gonna need
a well-toned upper body...

09:36.676 --> 09:38.337
...or a shirt.

09:38.511 --> 09:39.808
All right, who's first?

09:43.549 --> 09:44.982
-Name please?
-Rusty.

09:45.151 --> 09:46.140
Rusty.

09:46.319 --> 09:49.618
You know, I once knew a horse
named Rusty. No offense.

09:49.789 --> 09:52.189
All right, now.
Take it down to the end of the block.

09:52.358 --> 09:55.327
Make a controlled turn and bring
her back. Let's see what you got.

09:55.494 --> 09:58.258
-Okay, ready and go.
-Giddap.

09:58.431 --> 09:59.420
Good form.

09:59.599 --> 10:03.091
Pace yourself. You're gonna have
to do this all day for very little money.

10:04.303 --> 10:07.204
-Hey, what's he doing?
-I think he's stealing our rickshaw.

10:09.542 --> 10:11.442
Well, then he's out.

10:12.111 --> 10:15.171
I'll take the job. Potato salad.

10:20.152 --> 10:23.019
Yes, I need to return this book.

10:24.156 --> 10:25.953
I'm sorry,
we can't take this book back.

10:26.125 --> 10:28.116
-Why not?
-It's been flagged.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.529
-Flagged?
-It's been in the bathroom.

10:32.698 --> 10:34.063
It says that on the computer?

10:34.233 --> 10:35.495
Please take it home.

10:35.668 --> 10:37.863
We don't want it near
the other books.

10:38.738 --> 10:43.300
Well, you just lost a lot of business
because I love to read.

10:48.347 --> 10:49.837
I don't believe this.

10:52.785 --> 10:54.343
I wonder if you could do me
a favor.

10:54.520 --> 10:57.080
My uncle's having a little problem
with shoplifting.

10:57.256 --> 10:58.348
Where's your uncle?

10:58.958 --> 11:00.653
He's over there in the overcoat.

11:00.826 --> 11:03.761
If you could just kind of put a scare
into him. Set him straight.

11:03.929 --> 11:08.389
We have a 5150
in paperbacks. All units respond.

11:08.567 --> 11:10.159
<i>Roger. Ten-four.</i>

11:10.336 --> 11:12.133
5150. That's just a scare, right?

11:12.304 --> 11:14.602
I'm gonna have to ask you
to stand out of the way...

11:14.774 --> 11:16.742
...and let us handle this.

11:17.343 --> 11:18.776
Swarm. Swarm.

11:19.278 --> 11:20.836
What?

11:21.480 --> 11:24.847
-I'm an old man. I'm confused.
-You're under arrest.

11:25.017 --> 11:26.575
I just wanted you to scare him.

11:26.752 --> 11:28.743
Jerry, you ratted me out.

11:29.321 --> 11:30.845
Hello?

11:31.590 --> 11:33.251
Hello.

11:37.863 --> 11:39.694
Mom, I didn't rat out Uncle Leo.

11:40.132 --> 11:42.726
I just wanted the guard
to scare him straight.

11:42.902 --> 11:45.029
Jerry, he won't last a day in prison.

11:45.604 --> 11:48.402
Prison? I'm sure it's just a fine.

11:48.574 --> 11:49.700
He's got priors.

11:50.209 --> 11:52.370
Prior convictions? Leo?

11:52.545 --> 11:55.105
It was a crime of passion.
Leave it alone.

11:56.315 --> 11:59.375
Besides, it's not stealing
if it's something you need.

11:59.552 --> 12:02.419
-What does that mean?
-Nobody pays for everything.

12:02.588 --> 12:05.785
You're stealing too?
What are you stealing?

12:05.958 --> 12:07.186
Nothing.

12:07.359 --> 12:10.590
Batteries.
Well, they wear out so quick.

12:10.763 --> 12:12.162
Mom, you too?

12:12.331 --> 12:15.960
Sometimes your father forgets,
so, I have to steal them.

12:17.636 --> 12:19.433
All right, I'll talk to you later.

12:21.207 --> 12:23.471
Well, the rickshaw's gone.

12:23.642 --> 12:26.975
We strapped it to a homeless guy
and he bolted.

12:28.814 --> 12:32.079
Well, you know, 85 percent of all
homeless-rickshaw businesses fail...

12:32.251 --> 12:33.912
...within the first three months.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.354
We should've got
some collateral from him.

12:36.522 --> 12:41.960
Like his bag of cans,
or his other bag of cans.

12:42.328 --> 12:45.320
We gotta find that rickshaw.
You check the sewers and dumpsters.

12:45.498 --> 12:48.763
I'll hit the soup kitchens,
bakeries and smorgasbords.

12:49.635 --> 12:51.865
To the idiot-mobile.

12:54.073 --> 12:57.008
So even though you're not really
going out with this guy, he's...

12:57.176 --> 12:59.770
-...cheating on you.
-That is correct.

12:59.945 --> 13:01.674
But here's the beauty part.

13:01.847 --> 13:06.875
Now, I stand up for myself by telling
everybody I'm dumping his sorry ass...

13:07.052 --> 13:09.782
...and I'm the office....

13:09.955 --> 13:12.423
-Tina Turner?
-All right.

13:13.859 --> 13:16.794
Well, I've been to every Brentano's.

13:17.496 --> 13:21.023
This thing is flagged
in every database in town.

13:21.200 --> 13:24.692
Is it so horrible
to have to keep a book?

13:25.337 --> 13:27.237
I don't understand
what the big deal is.

13:27.406 --> 13:28.998
They let you try on pants.

13:29.175 --> 13:31.200
Not underpants.

13:32.111 --> 13:35.877
-Hey, that's your Uncle Leo.
-Uncle Leo. Hello.

13:36.048 --> 13:38.107
-Jerry.
-Uncle Leo.

13:38.284 --> 13:42.482
I'm sorry.
I didn't know about your past.

13:42.655 --> 13:45.590
You mean my crime of passion?

13:45.858 --> 13:48.258
Anyone betrays me, I never forget.

13:49.028 --> 13:51.690
Uncle Leo. Wait. Hello.

13:53.866 --> 13:57.427
French Impressionism.
Oh, I love this.

13:57.603 --> 13:59.696
Now, what is the problem
with this book?

14:00.573 --> 14:03.167
-Nothing.
-How much you want for it?

14:03.342 --> 14:06.869
You know, I could let it go for
say a hundred and twenty-five.

14:07.413 --> 14:11.247
Leo's furious.
What is that doing on the table?

14:12.518 --> 14:14.247
Jerry. Simmer down.

14:14.420 --> 14:17.787
I'm not eating anything
in the vicinity of that book.

14:17.957 --> 14:20.551
-What is wrong with this book?
-Simmer.

14:20.726 --> 14:24.856
That book has been on a wild ride.
George took into the bathroom...

14:25.030 --> 14:28.124
-...at Brentano's--
-All right. Everyone clear.

14:28.300 --> 14:32.259
Biohazard, coming through.
Clear. Clear.

14:35.174 --> 14:37.301
May I ask...

14:37.710 --> 14:39.735
...what do you read
in the bathroom?

14:39.945 --> 14:41.936
I don't read in the bathroom.

14:42.648 --> 14:45.913
Well, aren't you something?

14:48.787 --> 14:50.379
Elaine, do you have a moment?

14:50.556 --> 14:52.251
It's about your lover.

14:52.625 --> 14:57.460
Oh, yes, I know all about his little
performance in the break room.

14:57.630 --> 15:00.997
Elaine. Who among us hasn't snuck
into the break room...

15:01.166 --> 15:03.498
...to nibble on a love newton?

15:04.637 --> 15:06.434
Love newton?

15:07.072 --> 15:09.802
I'm afraid the problem
with Zach is more serious.

15:09.975 --> 15:11.840
He's back on the horse, Elaine.

15:12.011 --> 15:14.411
Smack. White palace.

15:14.580 --> 15:17.310
The Chinamen's nightcap.

15:17.483 --> 15:21.351
An addict.
Well, it just keeps getting better.

15:21.520 --> 15:24.546
And in a tiny way
I almost feel responsible.

15:24.723 --> 15:28.489
I'm the one who sent him to Thailand
in search of low-cost whistles...

15:28.661 --> 15:33.689
...filled his head with pseudo-erotic
tales of my own opium excursions.

15:33.866 --> 15:35.800
Plus, I gave him
phone numbers of places...

15:35.968 --> 15:37.833
...he could score near the hotel.

15:38.304 --> 15:40.169
Look, Mr. Peterman...

15:40.339 --> 15:43.968
...the fact is, is that I was planning
on breaking up with Zach anyway.

15:44.143 --> 15:45.633
He was cheating on me.

15:45.811 --> 15:48.075
Damn it, Elaine, that wasn't Zach.

15:48.247 --> 15:50.044
That was the yam-yam.

15:51.483 --> 15:54.509
Now, he is going cold turkey
and you will be at his side.

15:54.687 --> 15:58.589
-Oh, what, you know, I had planned--
-No buts, Elaine...

15:58.757 --> 16:01.191
...or I will strip you
of your associate status.

16:02.328 --> 16:04.193
Oh, P.S...

16:04.363 --> 16:06.661
...the first 24 hours are the worst.

16:06.832 --> 16:08.959
Better bring a poncho.

16:12.004 --> 16:14.905
<i>It was a crime of passion.</i>

16:15.074 --> 16:18.009
<i>If anyone betrays me,
I never forget it.</i>

16:18.177 --> 16:20.441
<i>He won't last a day in prison.</i>

16:29.922 --> 16:31.583
Jerry.

16:33.092 --> 16:34.719
Hello.

16:35.427 --> 16:36.451
Jerry.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.298
Hello. Jerry.

16:40.466 --> 16:42.866
Answer the damn phone.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.935
-Hello?
-Hey, it's me.

16:50.109 --> 16:52.703
-Uncle Leo?
-Oh, that's nice.

16:52.878 --> 16:53.936
What are you up to?

16:54.113 --> 16:56.206
Nightmares. You?

16:56.382 --> 16:59.317
My fake boyfriend is going
through real withdrawals.

16:59.485 --> 17:03.387
-I'm burning up.
-Eat your soup.

17:03.555 --> 17:06.490
-You're not feeding him, are you?
-Why?

17:07.159 --> 17:11.060
I told you, away from
the curtains. Away.

17:11.230 --> 17:12.891
Use your bucket.

17:13.065 --> 17:16.057
There you go, that's it.
Okay, you know what? I gotta go.

17:23.308 --> 17:25.208
Hey, buddy.

17:25.377 --> 17:26.935
-Kramer.
-Thought I heard you.

17:27.112 --> 17:29.672
-Get out of here.
-Kramer. Kramer. There you are.

17:29.848 --> 17:32.248
Will everybody please leave.

17:32.418 --> 17:35.216
I just heard a postman spotted
a rickshaw down in Battery Park.

17:35.387 --> 17:36.911
-Our rickshaw?
-It's possible.

17:37.089 --> 17:39.649
I want everyone out.

17:39.825 --> 17:42.623
Hey, let's talk in Jerry's kitchen.
I'll make some cocoa.

17:45.164 --> 17:46.654
Goodnight, Jerry.

17:48.167 --> 17:50.499
Goodnight, Newman.

17:54.173 --> 17:56.107
-There it is.
-Rusty.

17:56.875 --> 17:59.571
Oh, there you are.
Oh, do I get the job?

17:59.745 --> 18:01.645
Yeah, yeah, we'll get back to you.

18:02.347 --> 18:04.577
Let's get this baby home.

18:07.753 --> 18:09.914
-What?
-You know, when you think about it...

18:10.089 --> 18:14.958
...it's kind of silly for us both to pull
this thing all the way back up town.

18:15.127 --> 18:18.460
I mean, after all, it is a conveyance.

18:18.630 --> 18:20.461
Yes, that's true.

18:20.632 --> 18:23.829
So which one of us is gonna pull?

18:24.636 --> 18:26.501
Well, there's only way to settle this.

18:26.672 --> 18:30.472
One spot, two spot, zigzag, tear,
pop-dye, penny got, tennyum, tear...

18:30.642 --> 18:34.009
...harum-scarum, rip them,
tear them, te, ta, toe.

18:34.179 --> 18:35.305
Yeah.

18:35.981 --> 18:38.347
Best two out of three.
One spot, two spot....

18:38.951 --> 18:43.012
Hey, boy. Smooth it out up there.
Too much jostling.

18:45.891 --> 18:48.155
So you wanna donate
this to charity?

18:48.327 --> 18:51.023
Well, I assume there's
some sort of write-off.

18:51.196 --> 18:55.030
-What's the value of the book?
-About $200 Miss DeMooney.

18:55.200 --> 18:57.998
It's DeMornay. Rebecca DeMornay.

19:00.305 --> 19:02.466
Oh, wait a second.

19:02.641 --> 19:04.632
This book has been in a bathroom.

19:05.110 --> 19:09.012
Well, what are you talking about?
That's ridiculous.

19:09.181 --> 19:13.049
It's been flagged. I know.
I used to work in a Brentano's.

19:13.452 --> 19:16.512
Mister, we're trying to help
the homeless here. It's bad enough...

19:16.688 --> 19:20.317
...that we have some nut out there
trying to strap them to a rickshaw.

19:21.493 --> 19:24.860
All right. I'll just take 50.
Do we have a deal?

19:25.030 --> 19:27.590
Yeah and here it is.

19:27.766 --> 19:31.532
You get your toilet book out of here
and I won't jump over this counter...

19:31.703 --> 19:33.762
...and punch you in the brain.

19:33.939 --> 19:37.033
-I could take it in merchandise.
-Here I come.

19:40.445 --> 19:44.006
So this book will tell me
how to get puke out of cashmere?

19:44.683 --> 19:47.618
-Yeah.
-Great.

19:48.420 --> 19:50.217
-So the worst is over?
-Yeah.

19:50.389 --> 19:52.448
Now I can break up with him.

19:52.624 --> 19:55.058
He's clean and I'm the office hero.

19:55.227 --> 19:57.525
You're better at fake relationships
than real ones.

19:57.696 --> 20:02.224
Yeah. I even got an idea out of it.
The detox poncho.

20:03.635 --> 20:05.398
I'll see you.

20:05.737 --> 20:08.069
I'd like to speak
with the manager, please.

20:08.574 --> 20:11.202
Fine your pace, boy. Chop chop.

20:11.977 --> 20:14.946
Well, I've hit the wall.
I gotta take a break.

20:15.414 --> 20:18.144
Well, don't tarry,
I'm behind schedule as it is.

20:19.618 --> 20:21.609
Boy. Boy.

20:21.787 --> 20:23.755
Kramer!

20:29.928 --> 20:33.921
Well, this is the first day
of the rest of my life.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.409
George, what are you doing here?

20:56.288 --> 20:59.086
I can't sell the book.
It's been marked.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.249
It certainly has.

21:02.828 --> 21:06.195
So, I'm gonna steal another one
and then I'm gonna return it.

21:06.365 --> 21:08.458
That way, everything is even.

21:08.634 --> 21:13.367
You defile one book, steal another,
ask for your money back...

21:13.538 --> 21:15.335
...and to you that's even.

21:16.608 --> 21:18.075
I'm going in.

21:19.211 --> 21:20.940
Did you want to speak
to the manager?

21:21.113 --> 21:24.173
Yes. My Uncle Leo was caught
shoplifting here the other day.

21:24.349 --> 21:27.409
Yes. Uncle Leo. I remember him.

21:27.586 --> 21:30.453
I'm sorry. Our policy is
we prosecute all shoplifters.

21:30.622 --> 21:33.955
Oh, come on. He's just a lonely
old man. All old people steal.

21:34.126 --> 21:37.618
That's right. That's why we stopped
carrying batteries.

21:37.796 --> 21:38.854
I'll be honest with you.

21:39.031 --> 21:41.727
We've had trouble with theft
lately and my boss said...

21:41.900 --> 21:43.663
...I have to make an example
of someone.

21:43.835 --> 21:46.030
-So it could be anyone?
-Well, I guess.

21:46.204 --> 21:48.536
As long as we catch him in the act.

21:50.976 --> 21:54.036
That guy. Swarm. Swarm.

21:54.913 --> 21:57.711
Oh, Jerry!
