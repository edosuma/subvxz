SOPHIE:
Previously on How I Met Your Father...

00:16.767 --> 00:18.936
- Send your absolute best photo,

00:18.936 --> 00:22.564
and I'll consider squeezing you
into our New Voices show.

00:23.023 --> 00:25.067
- I got to take the perfect shot.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.737
- When you're a struggling artist,

00:28.737 --> 00:31.240
you only get so many chances
to prove yourself.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.534
So, when a big one presents itself,

00:33.534 --> 00:35.327
you can't help but wonder,

00:35.327 --> 00:37.037
"Am I good enough?"

00:37.037 --> 00:38.413
- I'm not good enough!

00:38.413 --> 00:40.666
All of these photos are terrible!

00:40.666 --> 00:41.917
- Alright, calm down.

00:41.917 --> 00:45.087
- Hey! Don't tell a woman to calm down!
We hate that!

00:45.087 --> 00:47.631
- It's almost as bad
as telling us that we look tired.

00:47.631 --> 00:49.508
You think that we don't
know that we're tired?!

00:49.508 --> 00:50.926
We're the ones inside of our bodies!

00:52.219 --> 00:54.888
- Do you guys think
any of these are good?

00:55.305 --> 00:57.140
- I love this one of a blurry tampon.

00:57.140 --> 00:58.684
You know, what a powerful statement

00:58.684 --> 01:00.936
about how we need
to focus on women's issues.

01:01.353 --> 01:03.897
- That's a photo I accidentally
took inside my purse.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.692
- Or... is it art?

01:07.442 --> 01:09.444
- Woo! 'Sup, fam?

01:09.444 --> 01:11.446
Guess who's finally recording new music

01:11.446 --> 01:12.865
as a solo artist?

01:12.865 --> 01:15.075
- Did Jungkook leave BTS and go solo?

01:15.075 --> 01:17.369
Mm, we all saw it coming!

01:17.369 --> 01:19.121
- No! It's me!

01:19.121 --> 01:21.999
I finally laid down some
new tracks without Meredith.

01:21.999 --> 01:23.542
Thank you!

01:23.542 --> 01:25.043
Yeah, that's also exciting.

01:25.043 --> 01:27.129
- Hell yeah, it is!

01:27.129 --> 01:28.839
Jesse,
I am so proud of you, man.

01:28.839 --> 01:30.924
Can I kiss your forehead? Mwah!
- You better.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.843
Ugh! I'm glad you're so psyched for me

01:32.843 --> 01:35.387
because I did max out all
my credit cards on studio time,

01:35.387 --> 01:37.806
and I'm going to be late
on rent this month, but...

01:38.348 --> 01:39.766
do you need any more back rub coupons?

01:39.766 --> 01:42.686
- No, Jesse, I got plenty
of back rub coupons, man!

01:44.146 --> 01:45.397
- I feel you, Jesse.

01:45.397 --> 01:48.108
I have drained my entire
bank account on rolls of film.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.067
But, you know what?

01:49.067 --> 01:51.403
That's just the life
of a struggling artist, right?

01:51.403 --> 01:54.489
Like, pour everything into our work,
live on the cheap...

01:55.240 --> 01:56.283
Here!

01:57.075 --> 01:58.994
Have some free fruit salad.
- Ooh! Don't mind if I do.

01:58.994 --> 02:00.954
- That is not fruit salad!

02:00.954 --> 02:03.498
- These are my cocktail garnishes!
- And they're delicious.

02:04.041 --> 02:06.335
- Oh hey, can I interest you
in little, uh, BYOB?

02:06.335 --> 02:08.378
It's one of my
struggling artist life hacks.

02:08.378 --> 02:10.047
- Hell yes.
- Oh, can I get one of those?

02:10.047 --> 02:11.131
- Yeah, of course.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.258
- And I wonder
why this bar isn't profitable!

02:14.259 --> 02:16.094
- I got to go home and change

02:16.094 --> 02:17.638
and shoot as many rolls as possible

02:17.638 --> 02:20.682
before Drew's big school
fund-raiser tonight.

02:20.682 --> 02:23.810
Wasn't that so nice of him
to invite you guys to that?

02:23.810 --> 02:26.104
He said it's like the Oscars
of public education.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.150
Bye!

02:30.150 --> 02:32.069
- We're not actually excited
about this, right?

02:34.821 --> 02:36.240
SID:
Well, well, well.

02:36.240 --> 02:38.575
Look at you.

02:38.575 --> 02:41.036
If it isn't the most manly man

02:41.036 --> 02:43.455
at the Jefferson Elementary
charity auction.

02:51.922 --> 02:53.048
- Hi, Sid.

02:54.258 --> 02:55.717
- What are you doing here, Meredith?

02:56.176 --> 02:59.012
Shouldn't you be out rejecting
the proposal of a young lover,

02:59.012 --> 03:01.598
and then fleeing to Europe with his cat?
- Okay.

03:01.598 --> 03:05.102
Of course, I could have handled things
better with Jesse, but...

03:05.894 --> 03:07.771
you know, there's no instruction manual

03:07.771 --> 03:10.315
for being blindsided
with a public proposal.

03:10.315 --> 03:11.692
Wait...

03:16.864 --> 03:18.574
- What are you doing right now?

03:18.574 --> 03:20.158
- I'm working on a new album,

03:20.158 --> 03:22.369
so I try to record stuff
whenever inspiration strikes.

03:23.287 --> 03:24.329
Wow.

03:24.329 --> 03:26.707
What are you doing different to your skin?

03:27.416 --> 03:29.001
- Well, actually, yeah,

03:29.001 --> 03:30.836
I've been using
this new alpha hydroxy mask.

03:30.836 --> 03:31.962
It's like--

03:31.962 --> 03:35.007
No! No. This is what you do.

03:35.007 --> 03:36.758
You charm people, you suck 'em in,

03:36.758 --> 03:39.553
and then you stomp their hearts to a pulp.

03:39.553 --> 03:42.848
- Okay, look, I need to talk to Jesse,
alright? And I don't have his new number.

03:42.848 --> 03:44.850
- Is he here?
- Nope. He's on a date.

03:44.850 --> 03:47.352
With Dua Lipa.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.938
- Jesse is dating pop superstar Dua Lipa.

03:49.938 --> 03:51.064
- Correct.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.483
They met at a Shake Shack,
ended up splitting a burger...

03:53.483 --> 03:54.568
- Dua Lipa is a vegan!

03:55.194 --> 03:56.737
Forget it. I'll just come back--
- No!

03:56.737 --> 03:58.155
No, no, no. Do not come back later.

03:58.155 --> 04:00.490
Jesse's gonna be home soon.
I got to go to work,

04:00.490 --> 04:02.659
so why don't you just... wait here?

04:03.327 --> 04:04.369
- Okay...

04:05.245 --> 04:06.580
What's your Wi-Fi password?

04:07.206 --> 04:09.875
- It's "Meredith sucks."
All one word, "sucks" is in caps.

04:12.336 --> 04:15.672
Ellen? Meet me at Pemberton's.
We have a code M.

04:17.341 --> 04:20.469
- Valentina, let's go over
tomorrow's looks.

04:20.469 --> 04:22.304
Michelle Williams' dress?
- Steamed and ready to go.

04:22.304 --> 04:24.306
- Harry Styles' dress?
- Steamed and ready to go.

04:24.306 --> 04:25.349
- Tilda Swinton's armor?

04:25.349 --> 04:27.100
- Polished and ready to go.
- And where are

04:27.100 --> 04:28.393
J.Lo's nipple concealers?

04:28.393 --> 04:29.645
- Right here, Fred.

04:31.772 --> 04:34.983
- These are black.
Her dress is sheer!

04:35.692 --> 04:37.361
Do you want J.Lo's nips

04:37.361 --> 04:39.530
to be staring out at the world
like a coked-out ow?

04:39.530 --> 04:40.864
- Sorry. Nobody told me.

04:40.864 --> 04:42.866
I think we have some nude ones.

04:42.866 --> 04:44.910
- You are an incredibly
dumb person, Valentina.

04:44.910 --> 04:47.204
- Fred, you cannot talk to me like that.

04:47.204 --> 04:49.581
- Oh, honey, I'm not talking
to you. Mm-mmm.

04:49.581 --> 04:51.583
I'm talking to my doll Valentina.

04:54.837 --> 04:57.172
- We both know that doll
is just a weird workaround

04:57.172 --> 04:59.341
so you can verbally abuse me
without a lawsuit.

04:59.341 --> 05:03.053
- No, it's not.
You stupid, stupid, worthless idiot.

05:03.679 --> 05:05.264
Oh, sometimes,

05:05.264 --> 05:07.224
I have fantasies about
taking you to a Knicks game

05:07.224 --> 05:10.227
and waiting for the kiss cam to come
around and land on us, and then...

05:10.227 --> 05:12.145
firing you in front of the whole world!

05:12.145 --> 05:14.565
- Fred, that was clearly directed to me.

05:14.565 --> 05:16.108
- Was not. I was talking to the doll,

05:16.108 --> 05:18.318
and you can't prove otherwise. Bye!

05:20.863 --> 05:23.907
- At least you got an actual doll.

05:25.993 --> 05:28.453
- Hey, bunny. Think we'll have time
to grab a proper dinner

05:28.453 --> 05:30.289
before this Drew nightmare.

05:30.289 --> 05:32.374
Apparently, they're serving
pasta made by schoolchildren,

05:32.374 --> 05:35.127
and I am not trying to get head lice
from a plate of ravioli.

05:35.127 --> 05:36.587
- One sec. I just need to...

05:36.587 --> 05:39.298
swipe something
from our accessories closet.

05:39.298 --> 05:40.966
- What do you mean, swipe?

05:40.966 --> 05:43.427
- I promised Drew I would donate
something to the auction tonight.

05:43.427 --> 05:45.345
I was just going to grab
a random blouse or something,

05:45.345 --> 05:47.347
but, lucky for Drew's school...

05:48.807 --> 05:50.809
my boss really pissed me off today.

05:50.809 --> 05:54.980
- Valentina, that is a beige lambskin
quilted medium Chanel 19 flap.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.398
It's worth thousands!

05:57.983 --> 06:01.153
Men can be bag hags, too.
You're gonna steal that?

06:01.153 --> 06:02.446
- Not steal it.

06:02.446 --> 06:03.780
Swipe it.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.365
- That's just an adorable way
of saying steal!

06:05.365 --> 06:06.366
- Chill!

06:06.366 --> 06:08.744
Nobody will ever find out.
Fred never checks that closet.

06:08.744 --> 06:10.454
Hey, stop looking at me like that,

06:10.454 --> 06:12.080
you judgmental little bitch!

06:12.080 --> 06:15.000
- Fine. Do whatever you want.
Just don't talk to me that way.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.878
- Oh, sorry!
Oh, I was talking to the doll.

06:21.798 --> 06:24.301
- Now, I know what tonight's
nightmare will be about.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.764
- Hey, you.
Hi.

06:28.764 --> 06:31.350
I'm really excited for you to meet
all my work peeps tonight.

06:31.350 --> 06:32.684
I told them all about you.

06:32.684 --> 06:33.894
- Oh!
Anyhoo,

06:33.894 --> 06:35.646
uh, any luck getting your perfect picture?

06:35.646 --> 06:36.855
- Not yet.

06:36.855 --> 06:40.234
I almost got one of a cat and raccoon
being interspecies friends.

06:40.234 --> 06:42.569
But, then it turned out the cat was dead,

06:42.569 --> 06:44.613
and the raccoon was eating it.

06:45.739 --> 06:46.740
- Oh, ew.

06:47.866 --> 06:50.077
Anyway, I-I really admire your hustle.

06:50.077 --> 06:52.454
- Thanks. Oh my god.

06:52.454 --> 06:54.248
I think this adorable old couple

06:54.248 --> 06:56.124
is about to kiss over a steam vent.
I-I got to go.

07:03.799 --> 07:05.425
Whoa! Ah!

07:05.425 --> 07:06.426
Ow...

07:10.681 --> 07:13.183
Oh thank God, nothing's broken.

07:22.860 --> 07:24.111
Oh...

07:27.364 --> 07:29.032
Jesse! Hey.

07:29.032 --> 07:31.243
You don't happen to have
a cheap dentist, do you?

07:32.119 --> 07:33.620
Thank God.

07:35.247 --> 07:38.709
Yes. If he gives me a free
toothbrush, you can have it.

07:41.170 --> 07:43.714
- What took you so long?!
Does code M mean nothing to you?

07:43.714 --> 07:46.008
- Literally nothing!
But it better be bad

07:46.008 --> 07:47.301
because I was in the middle of doing

07:47.301 --> 07:49.303
that alpha hydroxy mask you gave me,

07:49.303 --> 07:51.346
and now, I'm only half hydroxy!

07:51.346 --> 07:53.473
I got to go even out.
- Okay, no.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.642
Meredith is at my apartment right now,

07:55.642 --> 07:56.852
and she needs to talk to Jesse.

07:58.020 --> 08:00.230
- Do you think she's pregnant?
Did she look pregnant?

08:00.230 --> 08:02.900
- Actually, yes. She was glowing brighter
than the left side of your face.

08:05.944 --> 08:07.404
- Is Jesse going home before the gala?
- No.

08:07.404 --> 08:09.489
- So, Meredith's in your apartment
waiting for no one.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.992
- Correct.
- Very good, very good.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.702
Then, that buys us some time.

08:13.702 --> 08:15.078
But what's our endgame?

08:15.078 --> 08:17.456
- Well, we don't have one.
There is no end to our game.

08:18.540 --> 08:21.084
That is a really tight rap lyric!

08:26.423 --> 08:29.426
- My god, Ellen, our rhymes are lit!
- Woo-hoo!

08:29.426 --> 08:32.221
- Meredith's not the only one
who can impromptu songwrite.

08:32.221 --> 08:34.598
Yeah, not bad.

08:34.598 --> 08:37.434
Jesse's still not back,
and I really need to...

08:37.434 --> 08:38.560
Wait...

08:39.102 --> 08:41.688
You must be Jesse's sister.

08:42.356 --> 08:45.567
He used to tell me so many stories about
how close you guys were.

08:45.567 --> 08:48.445
What is that character you used
to do whenever you drank water?

08:48.445 --> 08:50.572
- He told you about Barbara Waters?
- Yes!

08:51.740 --> 08:53.575
- :
Today on The View,

08:53.575 --> 08:54.993
I will be interviewing

08:54.993 --> 08:57.621
a delicious glass of ice water!

08:57.621 --> 09:00.374
- Oh, that is such a good impression!

09:00.374 --> 09:02.042
You should audition for SNL.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.461
- Oh, stop. I mean,
it has crossed my mind--

09:04.461 --> 09:06.964
- Ellen, you're getting sucked in.

09:06.964 --> 09:08.215
Oh.

09:10.384 --> 09:13.053
Jesse just texted me.
He's back at the apartment.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.179
Come on, we'll walk you back.

09:15.305 --> 09:16.431
- Fine.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.935
- What are we doing?
- I don't know!

09:21.436 --> 09:23.772
- Thanks again for driving me here.
- Yeah, no problem.

09:23.772 --> 09:25.357
I'm just looking forward
to that new toothbrush.

09:25.357 --> 09:28.694
- I just want to get in,
get out, and get to Drew.

09:31.071 --> 09:34.783
Yikes. This place is worse than
my waxer the day before Valentine's.

09:34.783 --> 09:37.452
I told Drew I was gonna be right on time.

09:37.452 --> 09:39.454
- Uh yeah, that might be tough.

09:39.454 --> 09:42.165
Dr. Hoffman's super popular
because he's so affordable.

09:42.165 --> 09:44.501
The only way to get cheaper dental care
is to date a dentist.

09:44.501 --> 09:45.794
But then you gotta date a dentist.

09:49.840 --> 09:50.716
Okay...

09:52.009 --> 09:54.887
- Whether the weather be fine,
or whether the weather be not,

09:54.887 --> 09:56.513
we'll weather the weather,
whatever the weather,

09:56.513 --> 09:57.848
whether we like it or not.

09:58.724 --> 10:01.101
- Move over, she's spitting all over me.

10:02.728 --> 10:05.272
- Sorry! Just warming up my cords.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.608
There's an open call for Wicked later,

10:07.608 --> 10:10.694
and I have a really good
feeling about this one.

10:10.694 --> 10:14.323
But my gums randomly bleed,
so here I am.

10:16.158 --> 10:17.659
- We're not like these people, right?

10:17.659 --> 10:19.578
- What? No, of course not.

10:20.871 --> 10:22.748
- Oh, I see.

10:22.748 --> 10:25.125
Well, thanks for reading it.

10:25.667 --> 10:28.712
Any particular reason
it wasn't for you or--

10:28.712 --> 10:31.256
Hello? Hello?

10:32.966 --> 10:35.469
There goes
another six years of my life.

10:36.094 --> 10:38.263
- Hey. Sir?

10:38.263 --> 10:40.933
You okay?
- I'll be fine.

10:40.933 --> 10:44.436
I just really thought this novel
was finally going to be my big break.

10:45.062 --> 10:48.106
Hey, do you know if Dr. H
still gives out free toothbrushes?

10:48.941 --> 10:50.400
- Mm-hmm.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.486
- So, uh, like,

10:52.486 --> 10:54.071
are you new to the whole writer thing?

10:54.071 --> 10:55.948
Like, it's a calling
you found later in life?

10:55.948 --> 10:57.991
- No. Started right out of college.

10:57.991 --> 11:00.410
I finished my first manuscript

11:00.410 --> 11:02.120
the day Reagan was elected,

11:02.120 --> 11:04.248
and I remember promising myself,

11:04.248 --> 11:05.916
"I'm going to be a published author

11:05.916 --> 11:07.960
before that man leaves the White House!"

11:07.960 --> 11:09.545
- Ha, ha.
- And then I made

11:09.545 --> 11:12.881
the same promise to myself
when Bush was elected.

11:12.881 --> 11:15.717
Then Clinton. Then Clinton again.
- Yeah... Yeah...

11:15.717 --> 11:16.927
- Then other Bush twice.

11:16.927 --> 11:18.595
- Oh, please stop saying presidents!

11:20.264 --> 11:22.641
- Now, I know you think I'm exaggerating,

11:22.641 --> 11:26.228
but Dr. Hoffman was
the oldest dentist I'd ever seen.

11:27.563 --> 11:29.314
- Which one of you is Sofa?

11:31.066 --> 11:33.193
- It's Sophie.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.862
Sofa is furniture.

11:35.445 --> 11:36.822
- A bit louder, sweetheart.

11:36.822 --> 11:38.782
- Sophie!
- Sophie!

11:39.283 --> 11:42.995
- Sophie!
That's my great-granddaughter's name.

11:43.453 --> 11:45.372
Come in the back. I'll give you a haircut.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.499
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:47.499 --> 11:49.042
Come on, I'll look at your teeth.

11:56.466 --> 11:58.927
- Here. The bartender said, "Say when,"

11:58.927 --> 12:01.555
and I just stayed silent.
- I'm gonna need a lot more

12:01.555 --> 12:04.057
than a Big Gulp of shit chardonnay
to get me through the night.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.935
I'm an accessory
to grand theft Chanel.

12:06.935 --> 12:09.897
- Dude, I swear no one will notice
the purse is gone.

12:14.860 --> 12:18.197
My boss has noticed the purse is missing.

12:18.197 --> 12:20.908
- Oh my god,
this night can't get any worse.

12:23.452 --> 12:24.995
Did the kids make the wine as well?

12:26.997 --> 12:29.333
- Honestly, my tooth
looks better than ever.

12:29.333 --> 12:30.584
- Totally.

12:30.584 --> 12:32.711
You look like you could be
in a Colgate commercial,

12:32.711 --> 12:35.881
whereas an hour ago, you looked like
you could be in an anti-meth commercial.

12:37.007 --> 12:40.511
- Honestly, I was starting to question
all my life choices back there.

12:40.511 --> 12:42.804
We are nothing like those losers
in the waiting room.

12:42.804 --> 12:45.265
Ow! Oh!

12:45.265 --> 12:47.518
What happened?
- I don't know. The car just stopped.

12:47.518 --> 12:50.103
- Ow... Is my nose bleeding?

12:50.979 --> 12:53.649
- No, but you did break your tooth again.

12:53.649 --> 12:56.026
- Huh? Ah!

13:00.697 --> 13:03.158
- I can't stop thinking about what
will happen if we go down for this.

13:03.158 --> 13:05.953
I'll wind up in prison,
carving soap figurines

13:05.953 --> 13:09.706
and training crows to deliver cigarettes
to someone named Big Papa.

13:09.706 --> 13:12.668
- We're not going to prison. I'm just
gonna take back the purse before the--

13:12.668 --> 13:14.336
- :
Who's ready for an auction?

13:14.336 --> 13:15.629
- ...auction starts.

13:16.505 --> 13:20.217
- Alright. Let's get started with
this gorgeous Chanel purse.

13:20.801 --> 13:23.804
The bidding will start at $500.

13:24.513 --> 13:26.306
:
500, 500, do I hear 500...

13:26.306 --> 13:29.017
- I gotta bid on it to win it back,
so here goes.

13:29.017 --> 13:30.602
- $15,000!

13:30.602 --> 13:32.521
- And I'm out.

13:35.816 --> 13:38.777
- My mechanic said I needed
to replace my master cylinder,

13:38.777 --> 13:41.488
.but I thought I had a few months.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.031
- I found my tooth!

13:46.493 --> 13:48.078
Why would you eat my tooth?!

13:48.078 --> 13:49.329
- That was a Tic Tac.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.831
No, that's a pill.

13:51.498 --> 13:52.332
- Damn it!

13:53.041 --> 13:55.460
What if we are not
struggling artists

13:55.460 --> 13:57.546
on the verge of our big breaks?

13:57.546 --> 14:00.716
What if we are going to wind up like
those sad people in the waiting room,

14:00.716 --> 14:03.302
using old presidents
to track how long we've been failures

14:03.302 --> 14:05.888
because I've been taking photos
since Obama...

14:05.888 --> 14:07.764
Wah, I'm already doing it!
- Okay, okay, Sophie, stop it.

14:07.764 --> 14:10.392
Alright, I've seen your photos.
They're fantastic.

14:10.392 --> 14:12.144
You've got a half dozen shots

14:12.144 --> 14:15.355
you could send in right now to impress
that hoity-toity gallery woman.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.274
And even if for some reason
she doesn't like them,

14:17.274 --> 14:18.901
somebody else will.

14:19.443 --> 14:20.444
- How do you know?

14:20.444 --> 14:23.238
- Because the way you see
the world is-is incredible!

14:23.238 --> 14:27.075
You're like this insane little ball of joy
and hope and optimism.

14:27.075 --> 14:29.995
I mean, even today.
Y-you were eating cocktail garnishes

14:29.995 --> 14:31.622
and acting like it was a lobster dinner.

14:32.831 --> 14:34.041
That's why I love being around you,

14:34.041 --> 14:37.252
and it's how I know the world
is going to love your photos.

14:38.086 --> 14:39.421
'Cause you're amazing.

14:42.216 --> 14:43.383
- Oh...

14:44.092 --> 14:45.385
Um...

14:46.303 --> 14:47.304
Thank you.

14:48.764 --> 14:50.474
- No problem.

14:57.689 --> 14:59.441
FUTURE SOPHIE:
And that's when it happened.

14:59.441 --> 15:01.235
My perfect shot.

15:02.069 --> 15:03.695
- Jesse, don't move.

15:03.695 --> 15:05.572
- Why? Is there a bee on me?

15:05.572 --> 15:07.533
I lost my EpiPen.
I couldn't afford a new one.

15:07.533 --> 15:09.159
Oh my god, this is it. This is how I die.

15:09.159 --> 15:12.120
- No bee. You're my shot.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.747
- Oh. Okay.
- Just keep working on the car.

15:13.747 --> 15:15.874
- Do you want me to do that cool pose
where I look up at the sky?

15:15.874 --> 15:17.084
- Nobody wants that.

15:17.084 --> 15:19.086
- Okay.

15:20.045 --> 15:21.964
- Jesse?

15:21.964 --> 15:23.465
Jesse!

15:24.049 --> 15:27.469
That is so weird.
He must have just left.

15:27.469 --> 15:30.180
- Jesus. I haven't seen acting this bad
since my nana's nursing home

15:30.180 --> 15:32.057
put on a production of Dear Evan Hansen.

15:32.808 --> 15:33.851
Okay, look.

15:34.351 --> 15:36.770
If you guys really don't
think I should see Jesse,

15:36.770 --> 15:39.231
then I guess I can tell you what's up
and you can pass it on.

15:39.231 --> 15:40.899
- Oh my god.
Can we-- Can we handle this?

15:40.899 --> 15:42.734
- Have you met us? Of course not!

15:42.734 --> 15:44.570
We couldn't even handle
the Impossible Burger

15:44.570 --> 15:46.029
because it was too real.

15:46.029 --> 15:48.448
- Okay, in our defense,
what kind of vegetarian meat bleeds?

15:49.575 --> 15:53.287
- I wrote a new album,
and I got signed to a pretty major label.

15:54.246 --> 15:56.957
And the first single's
coming out this week.

15:56.957 --> 16:00.502
This morning, I taped a segment
on The Drew Barrymore Show, and...

16:00.502 --> 16:03.589
she called it
"a certified Barrymore banger,"

16:03.589 --> 16:06.550
and then a bunch of donuts
fell from the ceiling.

16:06.550 --> 16:08.468
I really do not understand that show.

16:09.094 --> 16:12.097
- Drew is daytime's new darling.
Get on board.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.057
- The single drops tomorrow,

16:14.057 --> 16:16.894
and it's very obviously
about me and Jesse,

16:16.894 --> 16:19.021
and I think the combo of me
having a big song

16:19.021 --> 16:21.231
and it being about
our relationship could be,

16:21.231 --> 16:22.399
you know, a lot for him.

16:23.817 --> 16:26.028
But yeah, m-maybe it's best
coming from you guys.

16:27.571 --> 16:30.741
Anyway, I'm staying at the Bowery,
if he wants to talk.

16:37.206 --> 16:40.459
- I can't believe I was your perfect shot.

16:40.459 --> 16:42.878
I guess my middle school
art teacher Miss Duncan was right.

16:42.878 --> 16:45.589
I do have the body of a model.

16:45.589 --> 16:48.467
- That is a very
disturbing story from your past.

16:50.219 --> 16:51.261
Um...

16:52.221 --> 16:53.722
All that stuff you said earlier...

16:54.848 --> 16:56.391
Thank you.

16:58.352 --> 16:59.311
- There you are.

16:59.895 --> 17:01.021
- Hey!

17:03.232 --> 17:05.609
I'm sorry I'm late,
and that I look like this.

17:05.609 --> 17:09.363
I'm hoping that the-the chipped
tooth adds more character?

17:09.363 --> 17:12.241
Like maybe I've got
a real juicy origin story.

17:12.241 --> 17:15.744
- Mm. You know,
the chipped tooth's kind of charming.

17:15.744 --> 17:18.497
The, um, the bird shit on your shoulder
leaves something to be desired.

17:18.497 --> 17:21.208
- Oh! Oh god. I...

17:21.208 --> 17:22.918
It was a long walk here.

17:22.918 --> 17:24.378
- It's all good.
Hm.

17:24.378 --> 17:27.214
- You missed the superintendent
but, um, glad you're here now.

17:28.173 --> 17:30.384
You know, Jesse,
that full-time music teacher job

17:30.384 --> 17:32.135
we talked about comes with full dental...

17:32.135 --> 17:34.513
- Uh, I-I'm good, Drew. Thanks, though.

17:35.848 --> 17:38.225
Well, okay. I'm going to let you two hang.

17:42.229 --> 17:44.314
- You offered him a full-time job?
- Yep.

17:45.232 --> 17:48.235
You know, I get that Jesse wants
time to work on his own music.

17:48.235 --> 17:50.529
I just... I don't know,

17:50.529 --> 17:52.531
wish he'd stop chasing
a pipe dream, you know?

17:54.658 --> 17:55.909
- Wait...

17:56.743 --> 17:59.913
Do you think that me making it
as a photographer

17:59.913 --> 18:01.707
is also a pipe dream?

18:03.709 --> 18:06.670
- Maybe... maybe we can
talk about this later?

18:07.379 --> 18:11.258
- Actually, I-I'd kinda like
to hear your answer right now.

18:14.303 --> 18:17.306
- Look, I-I think photography
is your passion,

18:17.306 --> 18:18.557
and that's awesome.

18:19.975 --> 18:22.686
But I also think
there comes a time in life

18:22.686 --> 18:24.813
when you should get a stable job,

18:24.813 --> 18:27.107
so you can plan for your future.

18:27.107 --> 18:28.692
Or afford a dentist.

18:31.069 --> 18:32.613
- Got it.

18:35.073 --> 18:37.743
- I gotta go say hi to
those teachers. Um...

18:38.702 --> 18:40.412
We'll keep talking later, okay?

18:50.839 --> 18:53.300
- Well, it's official.
Fred's going to fire me.

18:54.051 --> 18:55.719
I've worked for that horrible man

18:55.719 --> 18:58.222
for five excruciating years,

18:58.222 --> 19:00.265
and I put up with him
because I told myself

19:00.265 --> 19:03.519
that it was a stepping stone
to something great, but now...

19:04.228 --> 19:06.021
it's all for nothing.

19:06.021 --> 19:08.106
He knows everyone in this industry,

19:08.106 --> 19:10.025
and he will make sure
that I'm known as the girl

19:10.025 --> 19:13.695
who stole the beige lambskin
quilted medium Chanel 19 flap.

19:15.072 --> 19:16.406
- No, he won't.

19:17.741 --> 19:19.743
Because I am swiping it back.

19:22.371 --> 19:25.290
- But you hate stealing.
- I know.

19:25.290 --> 19:26.750
But I love you more.

19:26.750 --> 19:29.837
So just promise you'll wait for me
if I get thrown in the pokey for this.

19:29.837 --> 19:32.172
- Mm...

19:32.172 --> 19:34.341
This is so romantic!

19:34.341 --> 19:36.927
But I cannot, in good conscience,
commit to waiting for you.

19:58.532 --> 20:01.451
- Well...

20:01.451 --> 20:04.496
a lovely evening. Thank you very much.
Valentina, run!

20:08.542 --> 20:11.336
- Maybe we give him worse news
before Meredith's news,

20:11.336 --> 20:13.297
so it doesn't seem so bad.

20:13.297 --> 20:14.715
- Like what?
- I don't know.

20:14.715 --> 20:16.758
We can tell him he has testicular cancer.

20:16.758 --> 20:18.927
- How on earth would
we know that before him?

20:19.928 --> 20:22.639
- Oh, I love you, Bonnie.
- I love you more, Clyde!

20:23.849 --> 20:26.602
- Don't mind them. They're in
the middle of some very intense

20:26.602 --> 20:28.145
outlaw-themed role-play.

20:28.145 --> 20:29.396
Where were you guys tonight?

20:30.564 --> 20:32.566
- Something came up.
- Oh.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.443
Everything okay?

20:40.324 --> 20:42.242
- Sorry,
it's the tow truck company.

20:42.242 --> 20:44.870
My car broke down on the side of the road.
It's gonna cost me a fortune.

20:45.329 --> 20:48.332
Something tells me they're not gonna
take back rub coupons. Be right back.

20:51.460 --> 20:53.962
- Maybe we can just tell him tomorrow.
- Yes.

20:54.922 --> 20:58.091
Tomorrow is a perfect day
for you to tell him.

21:01.053 --> 21:03.514
FUTURE SOPHIE:
Am I good enough to make it as an artist?

21:03.514 --> 21:06.517
That's the question I asked myself
a thousand times a day back then.

21:07.976 --> 21:11.522
Except when I was
around a certain someone.

21:13.565 --> 21:15.192
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:16.109 --> 21:17.194
Why aren't you with Drew?

21:18.487 --> 21:19.863
- We had a fight.

21:19.863 --> 21:22.282
- Oh. I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

21:23.408 --> 21:25.661
Drew doesn't believe in what
I'm doing with my life,

21:25.661 --> 21:28.664
thinks it's time for me
to grow up and get a real job...

21:30.791 --> 21:33.293
I guess the way he sees me is...

21:34.670 --> 21:36.672
pretty different than the way you see me.

21:41.468 --> 21:45.013
- Well,
maybe he's not the guy for you.
