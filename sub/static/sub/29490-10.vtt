02:05.734 --> 02:07.431
Rosita:
It's your turn.

02:07.475 --> 02:10.913
Gabriel:

02:21.489 --> 02:23.186
Hi.

02:23.230 --> 02:26.494
Aw.
Okay, okay, okay.

02:53.825 --> 02:55.131
No!

02:59.831 --> 03:02.225
Gabriel:
Rosita, do you copy?

03:35.127 --> 03:37.565
I'm the one
that knows Aaron.

03:37.608 --> 03:39.131
We know who you are.

03:40.524 --> 03:44.006
The people you sent out,
they're in trouble,

03:44.049 --> 03:47.705
trapped in a cave where Alpha
has placed her horde.

03:47.749 --> 03:50.578
Now, they could still
be in there

03:50.621 --> 03:51.666
or they might've
gotten out.

03:51.709 --> 03:53.058
I don't know.

03:53.102 --> 03:55.147
You said the horde
was in a field.

03:55.191 --> 03:56.671
It was.

03:56.714 --> 03:59.326
Now it's in a cave.

03:59.369 --> 04:02.198
She moved it.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.156
The whole thing.

04:04.200 --> 04:06.724
Right before
they got there.

04:10.989 --> 04:13.775
I'm just telling you
what happened.

04:13.818 --> 04:16.734
I'm not sure you are.

04:20.216 --> 04:22.610
I'm trying to help.

04:22.653 --> 04:24.786
Why?

04:30.052 --> 04:35.405
The baby that they left
at Hilltop,

04:35.449 --> 04:37.712
he's my nephew.

04:39.366 --> 04:43.239
And I would do anything
to see him again.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.763
Where's the baby's mother?

04:54.816 --> 04:57.079
Dead.

05:03.825 --> 05:05.174
If I give you a map,

05:05.217 --> 05:07.045
can you show us
where the cave is?

05:08.699 --> 05:11.093
Yes.

05:34.595 --> 05:36.727
You're a liar.

05:36.771 --> 05:38.860
The cell.

07:13.824 --> 07:16.131
It's from
the last one.

07:16.174 --> 07:19.569
The last Whisperer
we had in here.

07:19.613 --> 07:21.615
You killed him?

07:21.658 --> 07:23.225
Gabriel: No.

07:30.101 --> 07:32.582
I did.

07:34.366 --> 07:38.501
Rosita: It was the oneyour people sent to spy on us.

07:38.545 --> 07:40.895
He killed my baby's fathertwo days ago.

07:46.378 --> 07:48.293
I don't know anything
about that.

07:48.337 --> 07:50.687
Right.
Never heard of him.

07:50.731 --> 07:52.123
I haven't.
Mm.

07:52.167 --> 07:54.517
I don't -- uh...

07:54.561 --> 07:57.651
It's amazing how much you say
you don't know.

07:57.694 --> 07:59.914
Let me lay it out
for you.

07:59.957 --> 08:03.047
You're gonna work very hard
in this room.

08:03.091 --> 08:05.659
You're gonna have to
convince us

08:05.702 --> 08:08.183
that you're different
from the ones who lie

08:08.226 --> 08:13.231
and walk with the dead
and eat worms.

08:14.711 --> 08:16.670
And what if I can't?

08:16.713 --> 08:18.498
Then you die.

08:19.760 --> 08:22.197
No torture.
No games.

08:22.240 --> 08:23.938
No second chances.

08:23.981 --> 08:27.115
You'd be the third one,by the way.

08:29.204 --> 08:31.946
All's I've doneis tell you the truth.

08:31.989 --> 08:33.730
Gabriel:
You haven't.

08:33.774 --> 08:37.691
This is not for show.

08:37.734 --> 08:40.432
I am
a servant of God.

08:40.476 --> 08:42.130
I've taken
many confessions,

08:42.173 --> 08:44.828
and I can tell when people
are holding things back.

08:44.872 --> 08:48.136
Rosita: Holding things backis the same as lying.

08:48.179 --> 08:49.746
Outside at the gate,

08:49.790 --> 08:52.836
the story you had about being
the aunt of the baby...

08:52.880 --> 08:54.229
It's not a story.

08:54.272 --> 08:56.753
...it does tug
at all the right heartstrings,

08:56.797 --> 08:58.755
but you're
hiding something,

08:58.799 --> 09:01.018
which makes the whole thing
a lie.

09:02.672 --> 09:04.805
Ask God if I'm lying.

09:04.848 --> 09:06.763
I've spoken to God.

09:06.807 --> 09:09.636
He told me
to hang you.

09:21.561 --> 09:24.128
I, uh...

09:26.870 --> 09:30.831
I killed my sister.

09:32.876 --> 09:35.618
I killed my sister.

09:35.662 --> 09:39.230
I killed...

09:43.278 --> 09:46.107
I killed her for Alpha.

09:46.150 --> 09:48.849
She didn't even have to ask.

09:48.892 --> 09:51.852
I just did it.

10:06.562 --> 10:09.478
You believe me now,
Father?

10:18.269 --> 10:20.881
Then you should get me
a map.

11:16.066 --> 11:17.720
Aah!

11:17.764 --> 11:20.636
Where are they?!

11:23.552 --> 11:25.510
Tell me!

11:59.762 --> 12:02.199
Gabriel: So,14 miles inland here?

12:02.243 --> 12:03.548
Yes.

12:03.592 --> 12:05.115
Scott: Any other way
in or out?

12:05.159 --> 12:06.595
There are others
in the area.

12:06.638 --> 12:08.815
I'm not sure where.

12:08.858 --> 12:10.947
And they'll be guarded.

12:10.991 --> 12:12.949
Did Earl send
those new weapon sets?

12:12.993 --> 12:14.777
Yeah.Enough for all of us.

12:14.821 --> 12:16.344
Good.
We're gonna need them.

12:16.387 --> 12:17.737
What about the border?

12:17.780 --> 12:19.782
It's gonna be guarded
all the way down to --

12:19.826 --> 12:22.698
It's clear.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.221
It's too long
for Alpha to defend.

12:24.265 --> 12:26.920
Most of the patrols
will be near the cave.

12:30.532 --> 12:32.969
Take her back
to her cell.

12:44.981 --> 12:46.243
So,
two rescue parties.

12:46.287 --> 12:47.810
Rosita and Iwill take the first --

12:47.854 --> 12:50.291
We don't know
if any of this is real.

12:50.334 --> 12:51.901
Don't we?

12:51.945 --> 12:54.556
You said you were sure
she wasn't lying.

12:54.599 --> 12:57.124
I am,
and she isn't.

12:59.866 --> 13:01.781
You all
are hesitating

13:01.824 --> 13:04.305
because you're afraid of them,right?

13:04.348 --> 13:05.828
You shouldn't be.

13:05.872 --> 13:08.091
That's why I brought herin here.

13:08.135 --> 13:10.528
So you could see.Laura: See what?

13:10.572 --> 13:12.574
That they're cowards.

13:12.617 --> 13:13.923
We broke her.

13:13.967 --> 13:15.142
Completely.

13:15.185 --> 13:18.058
And if we can break her,we can break others.

13:18.101 --> 13:21.452
If you come across one of them,keep them alive,

13:21.496 --> 13:24.151
start pulling teeth
and taking fingers.

13:24.194 --> 13:26.893
Get information,
because we now know

13:26.936 --> 13:29.112
the more pain and fearyou pour over them,

13:29.156 --> 13:30.592
the sooner
they drop the act,

13:30.635 --> 13:31.941
which is
what it is.

15:33.628 --> 15:35.586
You okay?

15:35.630 --> 15:39.155
You seemed a little offin the meeting room.

15:39.199 --> 15:41.679
I don't know
what you're talking about.

15:45.248 --> 15:47.903
Look,why don't you stay here

15:47.947 --> 15:49.905
and look over the defenses
at the gate?

15:49.949 --> 15:51.385
Smart thing
would be having me out there.

15:51.428 --> 15:53.213
I don't think it is.

15:54.301 --> 15:56.346
I'm not gonna freeze.
I'm good.

15:56.390 --> 15:58.131
But you need to worry
about your shit.

15:58.174 --> 16:00.350
What is that
supposed to mean?Means you're erratic.

16:00.394 --> 16:02.657
Name one thing I've donethat's been erratic."Cut off their fingers.

16:02.700 --> 16:04.006
Pull out their teeth."

16:04.050 --> 16:05.660
You're itching
for a fight.

16:05.703 --> 16:07.009
So what if I am?

16:14.843 --> 16:20.240
I can feel
that Coco is...

16:22.024 --> 16:24.984
...wondering where he is.

16:26.289 --> 16:27.856
And I don't want her --

16:27.899 --> 16:29.553
I know.

16:31.294 --> 16:33.470
Right.
I'll see you out there.

16:33.514 --> 16:36.082
You don't have to --I'll see you
out there.

16:38.606 --> 16:39.999
Judith: I'll make it
really fast.

16:40.042 --> 16:42.262
I'll be right back.

16:42.305 --> 16:44.177
What's your name?

16:50.574 --> 16:54.752
Nobody's asked me
since I got here.

16:54.796 --> 16:57.103
It's Mary.

16:58.408 --> 17:01.281
What were you like
before the Whisperers?

17:14.381 --> 17:16.600
I'm from Santa Monica.

17:16.644 --> 17:20.213
That was
in California.

17:20.256 --> 17:24.434
My parents' nameswere John and Alice.

17:24.478 --> 17:27.089
I went to school and...

17:39.884 --> 17:42.278
I don't remember.

17:42.322 --> 17:45.281
What do you mean?

17:49.720 --> 17:54.073
Alpha has a way
of, um...

17:54.116 --> 17:56.901
making you forget.

17:56.945 --> 18:00.644
You really don't
remember anything?

18:02.255 --> 18:09.697
There are echoes left,feelings.

18:11.481 --> 18:13.440
I was ordinary.

18:13.483 --> 18:15.442
That much I know.

18:15.485 --> 18:19.446
And when
it all went down,

18:19.489 --> 18:25.495
my sister and Ikept making bad decisions.

18:25.539 --> 18:29.717
We needed someoneto make them for us,

18:29.760 --> 18:32.372
and then we met Alpha.

18:34.417 --> 18:37.159
You met
the wrong person first.

18:37.203 --> 18:39.770
If you'd met
my mom or my dad,

18:39.814 --> 18:41.990
you wouldn't be
in that cell.

18:47.561 --> 18:49.998
You don't look like
a monster to me.

18:51.565 --> 18:52.957
Rosita: Judith.

18:54.829 --> 18:57.005
We're about
to go on lockdown.

18:57.048 --> 18:59.399
You should get inside.

19:00.835 --> 19:02.402
Bye.

19:02.445 --> 19:04.752
Bye.

20:21.785 --> 20:23.134
Aah!

20:53.208 --> 20:55.993
How many can you see
in the herd?Man: 100 at least.

20:56.037 --> 20:57.386
It's hard to tell,

20:57.430 --> 20:59.170
but it looks like
there are Whisperers in it.

20:59.214 --> 21:01.521
It's on its way.
What should we --

21:01.564 --> 21:04.175
Echo post, say again.We lost you.

21:04.219 --> 21:07.222
Echo post, respond.

21:08.615 --> 21:10.094
That watch tower's
two miles away.

21:10.138 --> 21:11.922
We can't let this next wave
bunch up at the gate

21:11.966 --> 21:13.184
the way
the last one did.

21:13.228 --> 21:15.099
Why would they
send a herd now?

21:15.143 --> 21:17.101
We have a defector
giving us information.

21:17.145 --> 21:19.103
They're trying to stop us
before we act on it.

21:19.147 --> 21:22.063
We're gonna have to split up
if we want to cover both gates.

21:22.106 --> 21:24.239
Scott: That means less peopleout there.

21:24.283 --> 21:27.242
We don't have a choice.

21:27.286 --> 21:28.461
Show of hands --

21:28.504 --> 21:29.940
how many people here
have been on gate duty?

21:29.984 --> 21:31.290
Man:
I have.

21:31.333 --> 21:33.683
Alright,
how many do we need?

21:33.727 --> 21:35.250
Need or want?

21:35.294 --> 21:39.254
Six, plus you, me,
Rosita, and Gabe.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.603
Alright, you seven,

21:40.647 --> 21:42.257
you're gonna be
on the main gate.

21:42.301 --> 21:43.650
Hold on. New plan.

21:43.693 --> 21:45.173
Rosita and Laura,

21:45.216 --> 21:47.393
stay back on gate securitywith a skeleton crew.

21:47.436 --> 21:49.960
You and I take a squadout to the outpost,

21:50.004 --> 21:52.180
break up the herd,and then move on to the cave.

21:52.223 --> 21:53.573
Good?
Yeah. Yeah.

21:55.401 --> 21:57.533
Gonna grab that.

21:57.577 --> 22:00.362
I didn't want --I'm not trying to speak for you.No, it's fine.

22:00.406 --> 22:03.757
I don't trust myself
out there anyway.

22:03.800 --> 22:07.369
Could get us both killed,
and then Coco would...

22:07.413 --> 22:09.763
It's okay.

22:09.806 --> 22:13.549
I'm having nightmares
about them.

22:13.593 --> 22:16.030
Dreams they're killing me.

22:16.073 --> 22:18.467
Scott:
We're good to go.

22:28.521 --> 22:31.350
I'll see you soon.

23:33.760 --> 23:36.763
All I'm saying is
we could make it into a game.

23:36.806 --> 23:38.721
I kill
more skins than you,

23:38.765 --> 23:40.723
you take my watch duties
for a month.

23:40.767 --> 23:42.943
I don't wanna mess aroundout there, man.

23:42.986 --> 23:45.293
Aw.
What, are you scared?

23:45.336 --> 23:46.555
Remember Lydia?

23:46.599 --> 23:48.731
My friends and I
beat the shit out of her.

23:48.775 --> 23:50.516
She barely
put up a fight.

23:50.559 --> 23:52.735
I'm telling you, man,
one on one,

23:52.779 --> 23:56.304
the Whisperers
are a joke.

25:02.675 --> 25:05.547
Man:
This don't make sense.

25:05.591 --> 25:07.897
What the hell happened?

25:07.941 --> 25:10.378
We'll go back
the way we came.

25:10.421 --> 25:12.554
You don't see
anything coming?

25:12.598 --> 25:14.643
No, nothing.

25:14.687 --> 25:17.646
No sign of a herd.

25:17.690 --> 25:19.648
No walkers.

25:19.692 --> 25:21.955
What the hell
is going on?

25:35.229 --> 25:36.752
They were forced
to call.

25:36.796 --> 25:38.972
Must've held the knife
to her throat

25:39.015 --> 25:42.366
to make him call us
and lie.

25:42.410 --> 25:44.978
Why?

25:45.021 --> 25:46.240
Most of us
are out here.

25:46.283 --> 25:48.372
There's hardly anybody...

25:48.416 --> 25:50.200
back home.

26:14.181 --> 26:15.791
Walkers!

26:23.843 --> 26:25.453
They're here.

26:25.496 --> 26:28.151
Check Morgan Street.
Come with me.

27:16.025 --> 27:20.247
This place --it isn't what she said it was.

27:20.290 --> 27:22.553
She lied.

27:28.647 --> 27:31.388
These are not
your people.

27:31.432 --> 27:32.607
But she lied.

27:32.651 --> 27:37.394
She is your Alpha.

27:40.876 --> 27:44.227
You think
you're still alive.

27:46.316 --> 27:49.842
You were dead
the moment you came to us.

27:53.149 --> 27:56.675
Step towards me.

27:58.720 --> 28:00.635
Why?

28:00.679 --> 28:04.291
She wants you.

28:04.334 --> 28:09.122
She said your death
would be painless.

28:09.165 --> 28:14.693
If you fight,
it will not be.

28:14.736 --> 28:18.305
Step towards me.

28:30.447 --> 28:34.756
All she wants
is me in pain.

28:37.454 --> 28:40.719
You're lying for her.

28:40.762 --> 28:43.939
Step towards me.

28:51.033 --> 28:55.168
I am not afraid
of you.

28:55.211 --> 28:57.910
Yes, you are.

29:06.048 --> 29:08.703
Get help.

29:29.071 --> 29:31.813
Help!

29:31.857 --> 29:35.034
Judith: In here.

31:39.375 --> 31:42.683
Okay, go, go.
Fast, fast.

31:51.518 --> 31:53.694
Aah!

32:06.141 --> 32:08.970
Hey!

32:46.834 --> 32:48.053
Mary: Stop!

32:52.231 --> 32:55.451
Alpha wants me alive.

32:59.890 --> 33:02.981
Step towards me.

33:10.466 --> 33:13.034
You will fall.

33:13.078 --> 33:15.428
You will rise.

33:15.471 --> 33:19.693
You will walkwith your sister again.

33:32.053 --> 33:34.664
No, I wasn't...

33:34.708 --> 33:37.189
I-I didn't...

33:37.232 --> 33:38.929
I didn't betray you.

33:38.973 --> 33:43.064
I just -- I-I drew him out here
because he was gonna...

33:45.371 --> 33:47.199
Please.

33:47.242 --> 33:49.070
Please.

33:51.246 --> 33:53.422
I'm telling the truth.

34:49.130 --> 34:52.612
Can you see
beyond the darkness

34:52.655 --> 34:57.007
into the light?

34:57.051 --> 34:58.618
No.

35:03.797 --> 35:09.672
I'm tingling
with joy...

35:09.716 --> 35:16.201
as I see the ones
who broke me...

35:16.244 --> 35:21.945
all around us,
standing there.

35:26.950 --> 35:29.910
Thank you.

35:29.953 --> 35:32.391
Thank you.

35:33.653 --> 35:35.045
Thank you.

35:35.089 --> 35:39.659
Thank you
for making me strong.

35:43.924 --> 35:47.884
Pain made me.

35:47.928 --> 35:52.759
Pain made you.

35:52.802 --> 35:56.502
Pain made my Lydia.

35:57.329 --> 35:59.722
You lost her.

36:01.246 --> 36:04.423
You drove her away.

36:04.466 --> 36:08.905
'Cause you didn't
love her.

36:10.559 --> 36:13.780
What did you say?

36:22.832 --> 36:26.749
What did you say,
boy?

36:26.793 --> 36:30.057
I can't hear you.

36:45.681 --> 36:48.162
I'm all ears.

37:48.570 --> 37:52.313
Are you really here?

37:52.357 --> 37:55.185
Yes, Mama.

37:55.229 --> 37:58.319
Don't call me that.

37:58.363 --> 38:01.017
You know better.

38:02.628 --> 38:06.458
You came home.

38:08.721 --> 38:14.727
I am you,
and you are me.

39:36.809 --> 39:39.507
They're waiting.

39:40.987 --> 39:44.773
I'm not here
for them.

39:44.817 --> 39:48.516
I'm not here

39:52.520 --> 39:55.262
They're human.

39:55.305 --> 40:00.093
Not perfect.

40:00.136 --> 40:03.444
Just human.

40:06.491 --> 40:10.538
It's all
I ever wanted.

40:10.582 --> 40:13.541
It's what
you never gave me.

40:23.595 --> 40:26.554
I need you.

I need you.

40:29.514 --> 40:34.519
I want you to...

40:34.562 --> 40:38.958
stay.

41:52.988 --> 41:54.816
This was Dante.

41:54.860 --> 41:56.165
Scouts in the tunnels
are saying

41:56.209 --> 41:59.995
the Whisperers sealed
whole sections off.

42:00.039 --> 42:01.997
Aaron.

42:05.871 --> 42:06.654
You're alright.

42:06.698 --> 42:11.529
Yeah. We, uh...

42:11.572 --> 42:12.791
What happened?

42:12.834 --> 42:15.184
Aaron,where are the others?

42:15.228 --> 42:16.751
We got separated.

42:16.795 --> 42:19.145
Most of us got out.

42:19.188 --> 42:21.364
Most of you?

42:22.322 --> 42:25.978
Not everyone.

42:26.021 --> 42:27.501
You sureyou don't want her with you?

42:27.545 --> 42:29.198
It's a short trip.

42:29.242 --> 42:31.766
No, I'll be back as soon asthe doctor at Hilltop clears me.

42:31.810 --> 42:33.812
Besides,
they could still be out there.

42:33.855 --> 42:36.466
I want her safe,
and safe is with you.

42:36.510 --> 42:38.077
Okay.

42:42.472 --> 42:44.692
Room for three more!

42:54.484 --> 42:56.835
I'm Rosita.

42:57.531 --> 42:59.577
Mary.

42:59.620 --> 43:01.840
I know.

43:15.418 --> 43:17.595
Easy, easy.

43:17.638 --> 43:20.815
Daryl:

43:24.253 --> 43:27.909
How long
I been asleep for?

43:27.953 --> 43:31.739
Most of the day.

43:31.783 --> 43:35.047
And you were just
out here?

43:35.090 --> 43:37.527
Yeah.

43:37.571 --> 43:41.140
Just watching you.

43:41.183 --> 43:41.923
Watching them.

43:41.967 --> 43:44.578
Deciding.

43:44.622 --> 43:46.624
Deciding what?

43:51.759 --> 43:54.370
Did you kill her?

43:55.458 --> 43:58.766
If it was your father,
could you have?

44:06.687 --> 44:09.995
I'm no longer weak.

44:12.911 --> 44:16.828
I'm stronger than ever.

44:16.871 --> 44:23.704
Our horde will butcher
and consume them.

44:23.748 --> 44:29.405
Screams will be song
to me.

44:51.950 --> 44:54.126
We bathe in blood.

44:54.169 --> 44:55.867
We are free.

44:55.910 --> 44:57.869
We love no one.

44:57.912 --> 44:59.958
We are free.

45:00.001 --> 45:02.090
We fear nothing.

45:02.134 --> 45:03.918
We are free.

45:03.962 --> 45:07.617
This is the end of the world.

45:07.661 --> 45:10.882
Now is the end of the world.

45:10.925 --> 45:14.450
We are the end of the world.
