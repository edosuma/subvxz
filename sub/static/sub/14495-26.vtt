00:02.201 --> 00:05.201
I'm supposed to be a futurist.
Working to build a better tomorrow.

00:05.202 --> 00:07.702
<i> What I did?
Is that the future I've been working for? </i>

00:07.703 --> 00:09.403
No one blames you, Tony.

00:09.404 --> 00:11.204
The world knows
it was the Purple Man.

00:12.205 --> 00:15.505
J.A.R.V.I.S. initiate the "New 
Avengers" protocols! Now!

00:16.506 --> 00:19.106
<i>This is an emergency message 
 from the Avengers. </i>

00:19.107 --> 00:20.607
<i> We need your help. </i>

00:20.608 --> 00:22.808
<i>Each of you has proven 
yourselves as a hero. </i>

00:22.809 --> 00:25.109
<i>someone has what it 
takes to be Avengers. </i>

00:25.110 --> 00:27.110
<i> The world is depending on you. </i>

00:27.711 --> 00:29.011
<i>So go save it. </i>

00:37.312 --> 00:39.912
- You're up early.
- Never went to sleep.

00:40.314 --> 00:42.014
I was flying around
just thinking.

00:43.015 --> 00:45.715
Have you ever stop to wonder about 
how history will remember us?

00:45.716 --> 00:48.816
I never have.
But now I can't shake it.

00:48.817 --> 00:51.517
The Avengers had fought
supervillains, evil robots ...

00:51.518 --> 00:53.518
even monsters from the Negative Zone.

00:53.919 --> 00:55.719
But it's gotten worse lately.

00:55.720 --> 00:57.320
The Kree. Kang.

00:57.321 --> 00:58.621
I just ...

01:00.022 --> 01:01.022
What?

01:01.023 --> 01:02.823
This is only the 2nd time ...

01:02.824 --> 01:04.924
I've heard you use the word "history."

01:04.925 --> 01:08.425
That's because I've never been able to imagine
a world without me in it.

01:08.626 --> 01:10.126
Until recently.

01:19.727 --> 01:22.327
This is what I get for talking about being "history."

01:22.328 --> 01:24.728
Avengers assemble.

01:37.129 --> 01:39.229
Okay, why is it always my building?

01:44.230 --> 01:47.830
I'm Terrax.
Herald of the Devourer.

01:47.831 --> 01:50.331
Prepare for the end of your world.

01:50.332 --> 01:52.732
For Galactus hungers.

01:55.027 --> 01:57.065

unlike any other </i>

01:57.066 --> 01:58.812
<i>When Earth's
Mightiest Heroes... </i>

01:58.813 --> 02:01.433

02:01.434 --> 02:04.635

<i> Thor

the first Avenger </i>

02:21.527 --> 02:23.655
<i> Avengers, Assemble </i>

02:27.257 --> 02:29.357
- I've got this.
- Iron Man, wait!

02:29.758 --> 02:32.358
I don't know what your deal is mister,
but you pick the wrong ...

02:38.359 --> 02:40.359
Avengers
take him down!

02:50.360 --> 02:51.660
Watch out!

03:10.661 --> 03:14.061
Wait! Is he.. is he ...
ignoring us?

03:14.062 --> 03:16.562
A mistake
he will regret!

03:16.563 --> 03:19.063
Hold up, Thor.
Whoever this joker is ...

03:19.064 --> 03:21.564
He took all of us down
without breaking a sweat!

03:21.565 --> 03:23.965
- We need a battle plan.
- Cap's right.

03:24.766 --> 03:28.566
Yeah, I know, "I've got this,"
was not my best idea ever.

03:28.567 --> 03:31.267
<i> This guy is putting up power
I've never seen before. </i>

03:31.268 --> 03:34.268
<i> Some kind of cosmic energy.
And that's not the worst of it... </i>

03:34.269 --> 03:37.169
<i> I'm getting a emergency
call from S.H.I.E.L.D. </i>

03:37.170 --> 03:38.770
<i>Whoever this is ... </i>

03:38.771 --> 03:40.371
<i> he didn't come alone. </i>

03:44.872 --> 03:48.172
<i> Three more of these "Heralds"
arrived the same time as Terrax. </i>

03:52.273 --> 03:54.973
<i> Each of them is building
some kind of machine. </i>

04:00.974 --> 04:02.274
<i> And that's not all ... </i>

04:02.275 --> 04:04.075
<i>Whatever these things are doing ... </i>

04:04.076 --> 04:05.376
<i> they want us here for it. </i>

04:10.677 --> 04:12.577
and it completely sealed us in.

04:13.278 --> 04:16.378
<i> Vision to Iron Man.
Your attention is required. </i>

04:16.579 --> 04:18.579
Something is happening.

04:27.280 --> 04:28.880
Odin's beard!

04:28.881 --> 04:30.481
It is a vessel!

04:30.482 --> 04:33.382
<i> Okay!
That's big! </i>

04:33.383 --> 04:35.983
Terrax said that Galactus is coming.

04:35.984 --> 04:38.084
Anyone ever heard of a "Galactus"?

04:38.385 --> 04:39.685
I have.

04:39.686 --> 04:41.986
Galactus is some kind of space god.

04:41.987 --> 04:44.987
One of the Skrulls told me it
destroyed their home world.

04:45.288 --> 04:48.288
It said Galactus eats planets.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.789
<i> Wait! Hang on.
Are you kidding me? </i>

04:51.790 --> 04:54.190
<i>Are you saying that something 
is coming out of this ship ... </i>

04:54.191 --> 04:55.791
<i> and actually eat the planet? </i>

04:56.292 --> 04:59.392
Cap this is it.
Everything we've been talking about.

04:59.393 --> 05:00.993
The future of the Avengers.

05:00.994 --> 05:02.794
What we mean
to this world.

05:02.795 --> 05:04.095
This is it.

05:04.096 --> 05:05.696
You're the leader of this team,
Tony.

05:05.897 --> 05:08.697
And i'm smart enough to know
that the stake is too high this time.

05:08.698 --> 05:10.498
We gonna need
everyone on this.

05:10.499 --> 05:12.099
And as good
as I am ...

05:12.100 --> 05:14.400
you're the right man
for the job, Steve.

05:18.101 --> 05:20.701
J.A.R.V.I.S.,
put out the call.

05:21.102 --> 05:22.702
Code: White.

06:02.803 --> 06:04.903
You are Earth's mightiest heroes.

06:04.904 --> 06:06.704
And I've called you
together for one reason.

06:07.105 --> 06:08.405
The end of the world is here.

06:08.906 --> 06:11.006
And it's our job to stop it.

06:11.007 --> 06:12.607
<i> You have your assignment. </i>

06:12.608 --> 06:14.608
<i>  Galactus' Heralds 
must be stopped. </i>

06:14.609 --> 06:15.909
<i>No matter what. </i>

06:15.910 --> 06:19.011
<i> Do whatever it takes
to destroy the machines
 they're creating. </i>

06:19.012 --> 06:21.812
<i> And then we take the fight
to Galactus himself. </i>

06:22.813 --> 06:25.113
<i> This is not a battle
of good versus evil. </i>

06:25.114 --> 06:26.914
<i>It's a battle 
for survival. </i>

06:31.215 --> 06:33.615
<i>We fight to save humanity itself. </i>

06:33.616 --> 06:35.216
<i> The world is counting on us. </i>

06:35.217 --> 06:36.917
<i> And we will not fail. </i>

06:37.218 --> 06:40.218
<i> Each of you are heroes.
But today ... </i>

06:40.419 --> 06:42.919
We are all Avengers!

06:48.920 --> 06:50.920
getting announces from S.W.O.R.D.

06:50.921 --> 06:53.421
Energy readings inside the sphere
are off the charts.

06:53.422 --> 06:55.022
And there is no door.

06:55.023 --> 06:56.623
We need to proceed with caution.

07:03.324 --> 07:05.424
What's Galactus gonna do?

07:05.425 --> 07:06.725
Eat us more?

07:22.726 --> 07:25.226
Hey there!
You got a little something on your face!

07:25.527 --> 07:27.427
Although ...
frankly ...

07:27.428 --> 07:28.728
It is an improvement!

07:29.329 --> 07:30.829
It's all yours, Cap!

07:34.830 --> 07:37.330
Your master is not
welcome here, Terrax!

07:37.331 --> 07:38.631
And neither are you!

07:38.632 --> 07:39.932
War Machine!

08:51.933 --> 08:53.933
Why do I have to be in the water team?!

08:53.934 --> 08:55.434
I hate water!

09:18.435 --> 09:21.635
Analysis of Herald,
designation Air Walker.

09:21.636 --> 09:22.936
matches that of Terrax.

09:23.237 --> 09:25.437
These beings are energy constructs.

09:25.438 --> 09:27.238
Presumably created by Galactus.

09:27.239 --> 09:28.739
<i> They are not alive. </i>

09:46.340 --> 09:49.140
Is it just me or this corridor is going on forever?

09:49.141 --> 09:52.041
This isn't a corridor.
We're inside an energy conduit.

09:52.042 --> 09:53.342
Wait! What?

09:53.643 --> 09:54.943
A wire.

09:54.944 --> 09:56.944
He's saying that Galactus is so big ...

09:56.945 --> 09:58.945
we fit inside one of his wires.

10:00.646 --> 10:02.446
Okay.
I'm freaked out.

10:18.947 --> 10:20.547
Galactus!

10:25.248 --> 10:26.548
Amazing.

10:26.549 --> 10:29.749
It's a being of pure energy.
Contained by the armor.

10:29.750 --> 10:32.050
Look at the energy  levels though, 
they are dropping.

10:32.051 --> 10:34.451
He must need to replenish his energy
to survive.

10:34.852 --> 10:36.652
- Enough talk.
- No, wait!

10:50.553 --> 10:51.853
Mission accomplished.

11:09.534 --> 11:11.171
Quake, go!

11:22.724 --> 11:24.077
No, you don't.

11:31.788 --> 11:34.626
You believe you can defeat
a Herald of Galactus?

11:34.627 --> 11:36.599
We don't just believe
monster.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.035
We're doing it.

11:41.827 --> 11:43.693
Take that machine down!

12:17.340 --> 12:20.288
You must hold,
he will burn himself up!

12:28.659 --> 12:31.063
Hulk, now while he has weakened!

13:21.218 --> 13:22.962
Hawkeye, go!

13:41.033 --> 13:43.997
You think you could use the elements
against me, creature?

13:43.998 --> 13:46.188
I will show you thunder!

14:23.743 --> 14:27.200
Cap, why is everything glowing?

14:29.910 --> 14:32.673
Oh boy! I think we just ticked him off!

15:09.471 --> 15:11.490
He reformed the machines.

15:11.491 --> 15:13.318
It cost him precious energy.

15:13.319 --> 15:15.191
That's why he needed the Heralds.

15:15.192 --> 15:18.320
- That doesn't matter now.
- Why? What's happening?

15:18.321 --> 15:19.734
It's beginning.

15:19.735 --> 15:22.422
Galactus is devouring the planet.

15:34.875 --> 15:36.751
I can't just stand here watching.

15:36.752 --> 15:39.040
If I'm going out,
I'm going out fighting.

16:02.685 --> 16:06.474
Tony, this isn't some sort 
of super-villain or would be conqueror.

16:06.475 --> 16:08.045
This is different.

16:08.046 --> 16:10.099
This is a force of nature.

16:10.100 --> 16:12.343
Give me something, Reed, anything.

16:13.094 --> 16:16.131
The Heralds' machines.
They are pulling energy from the earth ...

16:16.132 --> 16:18.963
and converting it to anti-matter particles.

16:18.964 --> 16:21.695
Galactus is literally consuming the planet.

16:22.650 --> 16:24.676
- We only got ...
- Stop! Back up.

16:24.677 --> 16:26.284
Did you say anti-matter?

16:26.929 --> 16:29.163
J.A.R.V.I.S., find
 the ship's controls.

16:29.164 --> 16:32.015
It came here through a wormhole,
there must be some way to reactivate it.

16:32.016 --> 16:33.979
That's a temporary measure, at best.

16:33.980 --> 16:36.263
Even if we're able to pull Galactus
into the wormhole ...

16:36.264 --> 16:39.706
he could be back in seconds from wherever 
in the universe you send him to.

16:39.707 --> 16:42.160
I don't intend to send him
somewhere in this universe.

16:42.161 --> 16:44.033
We're sending him to the Negative Zone.

16:44.034 --> 16:45.394
Anti-matter.

16:45.395 --> 16:47.955
Galactus consumes anti-matter.

16:47.956 --> 16:50.929
- And the Negative Zone ...
- is full of anti-matter energy.

16:50.930 --> 16:54.055
You, me and Hank once created
a portal to the Negative Zone.

16:54.056 --> 16:56.512
We've got 3 minutes to do it again.

17:20.944 --> 17:22.481
It's the end of the world!

17:22.482 --> 17:25.464
I'm freaking out,
why don't you freak out?

17:25.944 --> 17:28.558
- Because I can hear it.
- Hear what?

17:28.559 --> 17:30.313
Thunder.

18:04.236 --> 18:05.829
Hear me, Galactus!

18:05.830 --> 18:08.062
I am Thor, the Thunderer!

18:08.063 --> 18:10.858
Son of Odin
Prince of Asgard!

18:10.859 --> 18:13.415
But today, above all things ...

18:13.416 --> 18:15.406
I am an Avenger!

18:15.407 --> 18:18.349
And this world is under my protection.

18:21.209 --> 18:23.325
Iron Man
if you're going to do something ...

18:23.326 --> 18:24.826
Now is the time.

18:25.126 --> 18:28.062
We're on it, Cap,
take everyone else from under the ship.

18:28.063 --> 18:30.039
Things are about to get messy.

18:30.040 --> 18:31.676
Go! Go! Go!

19:19.543 --> 19:21.648
Before he ask, it wasn't me.

19:24.933 --> 19:27.832
- I take it this is your doing?
- Oh yeah.

19:27.833 --> 19:30.331
We were able to map the wormhole
to the Negative Zone.

19:30.332 --> 19:32.788
the heat of the cosmic power
that Galactus is putting off ...

19:32.789 --> 19:34.474
It actually is pulling him in.

19:34.475 --> 19:36.398
<i>We're not just kicking him off the planet. </i>

19:36.399 --> 19:38.548
<i>We're kicking him out of the Universe. </i>

19:41.938 --> 19:43.609
Don't be so sure.

19:53.940 --> 19:56.694
- Thor?
- I am with you, Iron Man!

19:59.836 --> 20:01.149
Now!

20:32.741 --> 20:34.108
We won!

20:34.109 --> 20:36.281
Wait, what did we do?

20:36.282 --> 20:38.190
We gave Galactus what he wanted.

20:38.191 --> 20:41.241
In the Negative Zone, Galactus won't
need to feed on planets.

20:41.242 --> 20:44.348
The entire universe is filled
with residual anti-matter energy.

20:44.349 --> 20:46.931
He will be feeding on the
infinity of the universe itself.

20:47.302 --> 20:49.083
You wanted to know how history will ...

20:49.084 --> 20:51.352
remember the Avengers, Iron Man?

20:51.353 --> 20:53.371
Well, here's your answer ...

20:54.072 --> 20:56.672
Yeah!
