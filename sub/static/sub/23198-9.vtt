02:14.078 --> 02:16.706
- What is the planet called?
- Earth.

02:16.781 --> 02:20.273
Two billion inhabitants,
primitive nation-states...

02:20.652 --> 02:24.247
crude beginnings in science.
They call themselves humans.

02:24.722 --> 02:27.486
They always call themselves human.
But they're not.

02:27.592 --> 02:30.060
They're savages. And they're dangerous.

02:30.128 --> 02:32.653
- Not yet.
- Do they have atomic power?

02:33.264 --> 02:35.391
They're just beginning to develop it.

02:35.466 --> 02:37.366
But they do have wars?

02:38.536 --> 02:39.525
Yes.

02:40.004 --> 02:44.771
Warlike savages with atomic power.
Next: Space flight.

02:45.109 --> 02:48.476
Then they become a threat
to every civilized planet.

02:48.680 --> 02:53.014
I vote we sterilize this Earth. Now.

02:53.151 --> 02:56.985
- You don't speak for the Council, Sakri.
- Nor do you, Andros.

02:58.990 --> 03:02.653
How long have you been an observer
on this Earth?

03:03.728 --> 03:06.424
A little more than 3,000 of their years.

03:06.931 --> 03:09.491
And you identify with them.

03:11.035 --> 03:13.026
Yes, I like them.

03:13.338 --> 03:15.101
You're an observer, Andros.

03:15.173 --> 03:18.768
Civilized, empathetic, but prejudiced.

03:18.843 --> 03:21.243
I'm inclined to agree with Sakri.

03:21.980 --> 03:24.813
- I think this Earth should be sterilized.
- No.

03:24.883 --> 03:26.714
The Compact Laws are specific:

03:26.784 --> 03:30.948
Before any action on a primitive planet
there must be a judgment.

03:41.499 --> 03:45.230
Very well. You will return to Earth.

03:45.770 --> 03:48.830
We will remain in sensory contact
with you.

03:49.741 --> 03:51.106
Show us these humans...

03:51.175 --> 03:55.771
convince the Council that they deserve
a chance to survive, to grow.

03:57.115 --> 03:59.549
But it will be up to you to pass judgment.

03:59.984 --> 04:03.647
If you can't convince us, Andros,
don't resist us.

04:05.523 --> 04:09.084
Then we would have to destroy you
along with the planet.

04:50.335 --> 04:54.362
Yes, sir, certainly. We will notify C.I.C.
On a continuing basis.

04:54.639 --> 04:58.905
We've alerted observatories to report
any more unidentified objects.

04:59.610 --> 05:01.703
Yes, sir. Thank you.

05:03.481 --> 05:06.507
Steve, this phone has been ringing
off its hook all morning.

05:06.584 --> 05:09.519
Everyone thinks that
that unidentified object last night...

05:09.587 --> 05:11.748
was some sort of secret weapon.

05:11.823 --> 05:14.815
- Any more sightings reported?
- No, just the one.

05:14.892 --> 05:18.089
The only other unusual report
was on the weather.

05:18.296 --> 05:21.094
Thunder, lightning,
and an incredible amount of rain...

05:21.165 --> 05:23.690
at exactly the same time that meteor hit.

05:23.768 --> 05:24.757
Meteor?

05:24.869 --> 05:27.861
That's what the Dominion Observatory
thinks it was.

05:27.939 --> 05:29.338
Maybe.

05:29.574 --> 05:32.566
But the Nazis have been perfecting
a kind of flying missile...

05:32.643 --> 05:34.406
sort of an airborne torpedo.

05:34.479 --> 05:37.039
In any case,
we do have a possible location...

05:37.115 --> 05:40.175
and the search squads
have already been out for several hours.

06:23.528 --> 06:26.497
- I've landed.
- We are monitoring, Andros.

06:27.131 --> 06:29.292
Commencing judgment survey.

07:19.884 --> 07:22.717
I don't care what kind of terrain you're on.

07:22.787 --> 07:25.517
I want that flying whatever-it-was found.

07:37.368 --> 07:38.767
Who are you?

07:40.972 --> 07:42.803
Identify yourself.

07:44.242 --> 07:46.369
What are you doing talking German?

07:51.682 --> 07:52.979
I'm sorry.

07:54.752 --> 07:57.915
Call me Andros, please. I am a visitor.

07:58.222 --> 08:01.817
A very peaceful visitor, come to speak
to the leaders of your government...

08:01.893 --> 08:06.193
- on a matter of considerable importance.
- It's a restricted area, mister.

08:06.264 --> 08:10.064
- I need some kind of identification.
- I've already told you, my name is Andros.

08:10.134 --> 08:12.728
That doesn't mean anything to me.
Who are you?

08:12.803 --> 08:15.533
How did you waltz
through a squad of my men?

08:15.773 --> 08:17.764
I'm a visitor.

08:18.676 --> 08:19.665
An alien.

08:19.744 --> 08:23.737
- You were speaking German.
- I do not come from Germany, General.

08:24.348 --> 08:27.283
But from what you might call outer space.

08:30.054 --> 08:33.888
And I must apologize
for causing this disturbance.

08:35.426 --> 08:39.020
You must understand.
It is sometimes difficult...

08:39.664 --> 08:41.495
to come into another culture.

08:41.933 --> 08:44.458
- What are you talking about?
- Tightrope walking, Major.

08:44.535 --> 08:48.403
I want to speak to President Roosevelt
and some of the leaders of Congress first.

08:48.472 --> 08:51.270
- What?
- Then Stalin, Churchill, de Gaulle...

08:51.442 --> 08:52.739
and Chiang Kai-Shek.

08:53.377 --> 08:58.246
Later, of course, Mussolini,
Emperor Hirohito, and Adolf Hitler.

09:01.385 --> 09:04.252
It's a bad time for jokes, mister.
There's a war on!

09:04.322 --> 09:06.586
Of course. That's why I'm here.

09:06.891 --> 09:09.052
As the representative of...

09:09.627 --> 09:13.028
Call it a Council of Planets.
The representatives of the Council...

09:13.097 --> 09:17.500
have been observing Earth and humanity
for quite some time now.

09:17.969 --> 09:19.459
Since the Neolithic.

09:31.115 --> 09:33.413
At this moment,
there's a great deal of worry...

09:33.484 --> 09:36.976
about the combination
of your planet's growing technology...

09:37.054 --> 09:38.954
and continued savagery.

09:39.857 --> 09:42.985
Many of us had hoped
that you might be more civilized by now.

09:43.060 --> 09:44.652
Are you here to pass judgment?

09:44.729 --> 09:47.630
No. I'm here to observe, first.

09:48.199 --> 09:50.394
To find the potential
for peaceful development...

09:50.468 --> 09:52.095
before it's too late.

09:53.104 --> 09:55.937
- I hope I'm making myself clear.
- As mud.

09:56.007 --> 09:57.770
You're either a spy or a mental case.

09:57.842 --> 10:00.242
Either way you're under arrest. Sergeant!

10:13.124 --> 10:14.614
Thank you, Major.

10:16.794 --> 10:18.421
Please do not attack me.

10:18.496 --> 10:21.761
I'm linked to my spacecraft's
special support system...

10:21.832 --> 10:25.097
and in guarding me,
it might hurt one of you.

10:27.071 --> 10:29.596
- General, as long as Mr...
- Andros.

10:30.074 --> 10:33.874
...Andros is willing to come with us
peacefully, why not have the meeting?

10:34.045 --> 10:35.672
The President could be informed.

10:35.746 --> 10:37.839
And speaking for intelligence...

10:37.915 --> 10:41.646
I'd like to find out just how
he managed to stun those soldiers.

10:41.819 --> 10:43.878
Something to that, Major.

10:49.660 --> 10:52.254
Get clear! Grenade!

11:15.152 --> 11:19.020
Sergeant, report to me at 1800 hours.

11:19.623 --> 11:21.318
And you, Andros...

11:22.460 --> 11:25.827
I'll arrange for you
to be conducted to Washington...

11:26.030 --> 11:29.488
to the War Department, pronto.
In absolute secrecy.

11:42.413 --> 11:45.075
Come on, Bjornsen,
you're a newspaperman...

11:45.149 --> 11:47.140
it's gotta be worth money to you.

11:47.218 --> 11:50.984
A story about a man who catches
grenades with his bare hands...

11:51.088 --> 11:53.556
- and holds them while they explode?
- I saw him.

11:54.291 --> 11:56.953
I think he's some kind of scientist
or something.

11:57.027 --> 11:59.427
And, listen, General Kane himself...

11:59.497 --> 12:01.897
is taking this guy right to the top.

12:04.301 --> 12:07.429
Maybe it would be a human-interest story.

12:07.571 --> 12:09.698
Worth $5.

12:09.874 --> 12:12.342
I ain't fussy. Not on $21 a month.

12:39.403 --> 12:40.427
Von Dreiberg.

12:40.504 --> 12:42.233
Reporting, Herr General.

12:42.573 --> 12:45.940
I have learned the Americans
are holding top-level meetings...

12:46.010 --> 12:47.602
with an alien scientist.

12:47.878 --> 12:49.209
Alien? From where?

12:49.647 --> 12:52.207
Nationality unknown, sir.

12:52.283 --> 12:55.684
But it appears he is central to
the development of major new weapons.

12:56.220 --> 12:59.383
New weapons? There have been rumors.

13:00.458 --> 13:03.825
Secure all facts on this alien scientist.
Then seize him.

13:04.061 --> 13:06.029
But, sir, he will be very closely guarded.

13:06.430 --> 13:09.194
I'm not concerned with that,
you will seize him.

13:09.333 --> 13:13.030
Out troops are smashing through Africa,
we will soon take Paris.

13:13.471 --> 13:16.269
With this alien scientist's secrets
at our command...

13:16.340 --> 13:18.308
we will conquer the world
that much sooner.

13:19.343 --> 13:20.537
Yes, sir.

13:32.256 --> 13:36.249
All right, sir, we'll set up
a preliminary session for tomorrow.

13:36.527 --> 13:38.518
Thank you, Mr. Secretary.

13:42.032 --> 13:44.592
Mr. Andros, the White House is interested.

13:44.668 --> 13:46.431
Just Andros, please.

13:46.770 --> 13:47.862
All right.

13:48.072 --> 13:51.439
In any case, we will arrange
a preliminary meeting...

13:51.709 --> 13:56.578
and demonstration
of your techniques for tomorrow.

13:57.815 --> 14:01.080
And that's necessary, before meeting
with the President and Congress?

14:01.151 --> 14:03.517
I'm afraid so, Mr...

14:04.054 --> 14:05.043
Andros.

14:09.126 --> 14:10.354
Pardon?

14:10.561 --> 14:12.461
That's classic Greek, sir.

14:14.598 --> 14:18.830
"A messenger to barbarians
is a beast of burden," sir.

14:19.970 --> 14:21.767
No offense meant, gentlemen.

14:21.839 --> 14:24.034
Something an old friend of mine
once said at a party.

14:24.108 --> 14:25.803
Socrates said that.

14:26.443 --> 14:28.206
Yes, that's correct.

14:29.847 --> 14:32.839
I see I am not alone
in having met that great man.

14:37.888 --> 14:41.380
Well, in any case,
Major Trevor and Yeoman Prince...

14:41.458 --> 14:43.756
will arrange for your quarters.

14:43.827 --> 14:46.660
They're expecting you
at Harrison Academy.

14:47.164 --> 14:51.157
That's an official guesthouse we use.
You will be, of course...

14:51.235 --> 14:53.829
a guest of the United States government.

15:17.628 --> 15:20.324
This will be your quarters, Andros.
If you will follow me.

16:01.939 --> 16:04.601
- Thanks.
- You're welcome, Major.

16:04.742 --> 16:07.370
Though I have the feeling
you didn't need much help.

16:07.478 --> 16:10.538
- And thank you, Wonder Woman.
- Luckily, I heard the sounds.

16:10.748 --> 16:13.239
- Where's Diana?
- She's probably getting help.

16:13.317 --> 16:16.775
I am delighted to finally meet
the fabled Wonder Woman.

16:16.987 --> 16:20.582
But not to see you earthlings give in
to your weakness for violence.

16:22.126 --> 16:24.117
We better all get inside.

16:25.696 --> 16:28.995
- Paul Bjornsen, Swedish news service.
- Thanks again.

16:30.768 --> 16:32.793
- Will I see you again?
- Perhaps.

16:33.170 --> 16:35.161
I'll look forward to it.

16:45.315 --> 16:46.304
Here you are, Andros.

16:48.986 --> 16:52.046
Are you all right? I notified the police.

16:52.156 --> 16:56.525
It's okay, Diana. It's all over.
Got a little help from Wonder Woman.

16:56.627 --> 16:59.858
Yes, it's fortunate Wonder Woman
was so close at hand...

16:59.930 --> 17:01.898
isn't it, Yeoman Prince?

17:02.032 --> 17:04.193
Yes, it was very fortunate.

17:05.469 --> 17:07.993
And we had some help
from this Good Samaritan.

17:08.071 --> 17:11.337
- Paul Bjornsen.
- Yeoman Diana Prince.

17:11.407 --> 17:12.965
Is this violence customary?

17:13.911 --> 17:16.641
Unfortunately, every big city
has some crime.

17:16.714 --> 17:18.614
Yes, of course.

17:18.982 --> 17:22.713
Babylon, Sodom and Gomorrah,
and your Barbary Coast.

17:22.886 --> 17:27.789
The names of the cities change,
but the squalor and crime do not.

17:31.261 --> 17:33.388
Well, we can talk about it later.

17:33.464 --> 17:35.489
I'd like some details, for my news service.

17:35.566 --> 17:36.760
I'm sorry.

17:36.834 --> 17:39.667
I think we will postpone any meetings,
Major Trevor...

17:39.803 --> 17:42.795
- until I gather more data.
- Look, they were just petty crooks.

17:42.873 --> 17:45.501
Yes, but why are there
always so many of them...

17:45.576 --> 17:47.510
and so few of the others?

17:49.146 --> 17:52.377
He once accused me
of being impatient with humanity.

17:53.050 --> 17:54.039
Lincoln?

17:56.887 --> 17:57.945
Yes.

17:58.956 --> 18:00.890
Perhaps I am impatient.

18:02.025 --> 18:04.721
But one week later he was assassinated.

18:06.130 --> 18:07.324
I'll contact you, Major.

18:07.397 --> 18:10.298
I'm sorry, but for your own protection
it's best...

18:37.795 --> 18:39.558
I accept full responsibility, sir.

18:39.630 --> 18:42.895
Nonsense, Steve.
You can't be blamed because this...

18:42.966 --> 18:46.663
alien uses some kind
of a super-science gadget on you.

18:46.837 --> 18:49.704
I certainly hope the General
isn't too hard on Major Trevor.

18:49.773 --> 18:53.641
Perhaps if he is,
a plea from a lovely girl might help.

18:53.877 --> 18:56.846
Our statements may also be helpful.

18:57.948 --> 19:00.974
I'll want regular reports
on your investigation, Steve.

19:01.051 --> 19:02.848
- And results.
- Yes, sir.

19:04.021 --> 19:06.785
Come on, Diana. We've got work to do.

19:09.793 --> 19:13.285
I'm sorry, Mr. Bjornsen, from here on out,
this matter is top-secret.

19:13.397 --> 19:15.763
Even to a friendly,
neutral Swedish newspaperman?

19:15.866 --> 19:19.461
I know you're a neutral and have press
clearance, but it's still top-secret.

19:19.536 --> 19:21.436
Of course, I understand.

19:22.739 --> 19:26.641
General Blankenship,
have you met Mr. Bjornsen?

19:26.777 --> 19:28.404
He's a very well-known correspondent.

19:28.478 --> 19:29.911
And an admirer of yours, sir...

19:29.980 --> 19:33.472
especially your theories
on airborne invasion technique.

19:33.550 --> 19:36.280
Well, that's most unusual, Mr. Bjornsen.

19:36.420 --> 19:39.150
A civilian who understands
technical military tactics.

19:39.223 --> 19:41.851
Actually, sir, I could use
your help and advice...

19:41.925 --> 19:46.487
for a series of articles I'm doing
on outstanding military theoreticians.

19:49.967 --> 19:52.629
I guess I have a few minutes. Come in.

20:03.580 --> 20:06.014
And we'll want to get a description
of Andros...

20:06.083 --> 20:09.484
out to every police station
and sheriff's office, as well.

20:09.653 --> 20:11.211
This is a full-scale search...

20:11.288 --> 20:13.882
and I've got the final responsibility
for finding him.

20:13.991 --> 20:17.085
Is there any word on the location
of the spacecraft, sir?

20:17.160 --> 20:18.252
No, not yet.

20:18.328 --> 20:19.920
I've got search teams crisscrossing...

20:19.997 --> 20:22.625
every possible landing site
in Virginia and Maryland...

20:22.699 --> 20:24.326
and still nothing.

20:24.401 --> 20:27.302
Sir, may I suggest alerting
the civil-defense workers, too?

20:27.371 --> 20:30.966
They may help supplement the search
for both Andros and spacecraft.

20:31.041 --> 20:33.976
- Good idea, why don't you take care of it?
- Yes, sir. Right away.

20:37.381 --> 20:39.781
If you get any other notions,
go ahead with them.

20:39.850 --> 20:41.374
Thank you, sir.

20:47.157 --> 20:49.022
As a matter of fact...

20:50.761 --> 20:52.558
I do have an idea.

21:08.178 --> 21:10.112
A local god-figure?

21:10.447 --> 21:12.312
A great human hero...

21:13.850 --> 21:17.581
great because he made peace
as well as war.

21:19.289 --> 21:22.087
- Where is he now, Andros?
- He's dead.

21:22.726 --> 21:24.626
Humans are short-lived.

21:25.595 --> 21:26.926
How did he die?

21:29.066 --> 21:31.796
He was assassinated.

21:32.636 --> 21:33.728
Of course.

21:39.710 --> 21:41.871
I thought I might find you here.

21:46.350 --> 21:49.410
How did you know me
when I was Diana Prince?

21:50.454 --> 21:52.888
I felt the difference between us.

21:53.824 --> 21:55.519
And the sameness.

21:57.394 --> 21:59.021
We're both exiles.

21:59.463 --> 22:02.261
No. I'm a volunteer.

22:03.100 --> 22:05.625
- A volunteer to help mankind?
- Yes.

22:07.270 --> 22:10.967
To work and fight
for justice and democracy.

22:12.409 --> 22:15.674
I think that's important and necessary,
don't you?

22:16.313 --> 22:17.302
Perhaps.

22:19.049 --> 22:22.348
He's an example
of what humans can achieve...

22:22.953 --> 22:25.888
can be and should be.

22:26.590 --> 22:28.353
You can help us...

22:29.026 --> 22:32.257
- help the Allies against the Nazis.
- No.

22:33.630 --> 22:37.066
I am sworn to certain regulations.
I must remain neutral.

22:37.134 --> 22:41.366
Even though General Blankenship hopes
I'll give him an arsenal of new weapons.

22:41.471 --> 22:44.963
Mankind is destructive enough.

22:45.976 --> 22:47.443
I understand.

22:56.186 --> 22:58.916
When you arrived, the storms...

22:59.756 --> 23:01.849
You can control the weather, can't you?

23:04.327 --> 23:07.592
I thought you would understand.
Yes, I use natural forces...

23:08.198 --> 23:10.325
from tipping the mind to sleep...

23:10.400 --> 23:14.700
- to changing the balance of atmosphere.
- I don't understand.

24:09.226 --> 24:12.320
The power you have, it's awesome.

24:12.562 --> 24:13.893
I don't use it lightly.

24:13.964 --> 24:17.092
As I said, I am not here to arm mankind,
but to study it.

24:18.068 --> 24:21.333
- Can I help?
- I'd like that very much.

24:21.938 --> 24:23.496
I need a guide.

24:26.443 --> 24:28.172
And I need a friend.

24:30.881 --> 24:32.314
$20.

24:32.849 --> 24:36.615
That's a lot of money for a plain,
hard-working Swedish newspaper man...

24:36.686 --> 24:40.178
but, here, $20. I bet you...

24:40.323 --> 24:43.087
that Andros demonstration will be at...

24:44.127 --> 24:45.754
- Fort Meade.
- No.

24:47.497 --> 24:49.761
Aberdeen Proving Grounds.

24:50.133 --> 24:51.896
I don't think I like this game anymore.

24:52.369 --> 24:54.064
You're right, Etta, and I am sorry.

24:54.137 --> 24:57.470
I know you can't talk
about top-secret information.

24:57.541 --> 25:00.635
You're right,
everything is always so hush-hush.

25:02.412 --> 25:05.074
But I do know one thing I can tell you.

25:06.149 --> 25:07.582
What's that?

25:08.018 --> 25:09.610
My phone number.

25:09.886 --> 25:12.787
And this $20 would buy a terrific night out.

25:13.323 --> 25:14.585
For two.

25:14.724 --> 25:18.922
Now that's a remarkable idea.

25:25.835 --> 25:30.363
I have agreed to this demonstration
to make clear that I am very serious...

25:30.507 --> 25:32.998
and that I must speak to the heads
of your government.

25:33.109 --> 25:36.943
I hope what I do here will make you accept
that I am not from Earth...

25:37.881 --> 25:40.907
and that I'm here
on a most important mission.

26:25.629 --> 26:27.961
I think you've made your point.

26:28.898 --> 26:30.229
I agree, sir.

26:30.300 --> 26:34.464
Then you do accept that Andros
is from beyond this planet, gentlemen?

26:34.838 --> 26:36.897
Yes, you've convinced me.

26:38.942 --> 26:41.809
What exactly did you want
to discuss with the President?

26:42.012 --> 26:45.914
The Council of Planets
is concerned about this war...

26:46.283 --> 26:48.979
and about your atomic research
at Oak Ridge.

26:49.152 --> 26:50.779
I'm afraid that's top-secret.

26:50.854 --> 26:55.348
Atomic power is the first step.
And the next one is space travel.

26:56.259 --> 26:58.727
Humans will swarm into the galaxy.

26:59.362 --> 27:00.852
Space is vast.

27:01.598 --> 27:05.466
And life is precious and rare.

27:05.802 --> 27:08.828
We cherish it. We do not have wars.

27:09.239 --> 27:12.140
- We didn't want this one, sir.
- Who is "we"?

27:12.942 --> 27:16.605
I come to visit not your country, General,
but your planet.

27:17.047 --> 27:18.708
And to make a determination.

27:18.782 --> 27:22.445
If this brutal warfare is any image
of what mankind is like...

27:22.519 --> 27:25.579
then mankind cannot be allowed
to advance into space.

27:25.689 --> 27:27.714
What do you mean "cannot"?

27:28.425 --> 27:32.293
If necessary, General, I will stop it.

27:32.362 --> 27:33.351
How?

27:33.463 --> 27:36.330
By earthquake, tidal wave, volcano...

27:36.399 --> 27:39.266
forces that will topple your civilization.

27:41.638 --> 27:43.128
I loathe the idea.

27:43.373 --> 27:44.362
Then why?

27:44.941 --> 27:47.705
I'm not a diplomat or a polite envoy.

27:48.645 --> 27:50.670
I am judge, jury...

27:50.980 --> 27:53.915
and, if necessary, executioner.

28:32.455 --> 28:35.424
Babylon, Sodom and Gomorrah,
and your Barbary Coast.

28:35.492 --> 28:40.088
The names of the cities change,
but the squalor and crime do not.

28:44.401 --> 28:46.892
They have been in that meeting
45 minutes now.

28:46.970 --> 28:48.938
You think Roosevelt will believe Andros?

28:49.005 --> 28:52.907
That he is from another planet?
I sure hope so. I think he will.

28:53.643 --> 28:57.044
He's been completely briefed
on everything that Andros has done...

28:57.113 --> 28:59.877
- and said.
- Do you know what I was just thinking?

29:00.183 --> 29:03.050
It's a lot more important
that Andros believe the President...

29:03.119 --> 29:05.451
that we are men of good will...

29:05.588 --> 29:08.580
and even though we're
right in the middle of this World War...

29:08.658 --> 29:11.183
there still is hope for this planet.

29:14.898 --> 29:18.561
I want to speak to President Roosevelt
and some of the leaders of Congress.

29:19.536 --> 29:22.334
I'm not a diplomat or a polite envoy.

29:22.405 --> 29:24.805
I am judge, jury...

29:25.508 --> 29:27.066
and executioner.

29:30.113 --> 29:31.842
I wish they'd call.

29:32.282 --> 29:34.182
This waiting is getting to me.

29:34.250 --> 29:36.775
There can't be too much longer now.

29:39.422 --> 29:40.821
Blankenship.

29:42.559 --> 29:44.322
Yes, Mr. President.

29:44.461 --> 29:47.089
Yes, sir. I understand.

29:49.098 --> 29:50.827
The meeting's over.

29:51.501 --> 29:54.493
The President says he has no doubt
that Andros is genuine.

29:55.305 --> 29:58.069
That also he could be
a very genuine threat.

29:58.908 --> 30:01.775
He's ordered me
to assemble a strike force...

30:02.712 --> 30:04.646
for use against Andros...

30:04.848 --> 30:06.338
if necessary.

30:11.020 --> 30:14.217
It was good of you to wait
while I spoke with President Roosevelt.

30:15.658 --> 30:18.718
You know,
if my determination is negative...

30:18.995 --> 30:20.394
and I become a threat...

30:20.663 --> 30:22.339
they're going to try to kill me,
of course.

30:22.374 --> 30:23.830
And fail.

30:24.167 --> 30:25.156
Of course.

30:26.603 --> 30:27.627
You understand?

30:28.338 --> 30:32.468
I understand that
I am Earth-born, Andros...

30:32.575 --> 30:35.305
this is my planet, my world.

30:35.545 --> 30:38.673
I know my mother, the Queen,
and my sisters on Paradise Island...

30:38.748 --> 30:40.716
would all agree with me.

30:42.051 --> 30:46.385
We cannot allow you to pass judgment
on Earth and destroy it.

30:47.123 --> 30:49.114
I hope you're successful.

30:52.161 --> 30:54.755
Tell me about your Paradise Island.

30:55.999 --> 30:59.196
It's beautiful, it's tranquil and peaceful.

31:00.570 --> 31:02.765
It's outside of time, Andros.

31:03.406 --> 31:05.874
We cherish old ways.

31:06.543 --> 31:10.070
We are close with the ancient,
natural order of things.

31:12.849 --> 31:14.578
We live together...

31:16.019 --> 31:17.384
in harmony...

31:17.954 --> 31:19.922
with our living Earth.

31:20.924 --> 31:24.360
If these are basic in your beliefs,
why don't you stop this war?

31:24.561 --> 31:27.155
I would, but my powers are limited.

31:27.830 --> 31:31.197
I'm trying. I've placed myself
on the side of the Allies to end it.

31:31.367 --> 31:33.494
- By force?
- Lf it is necessary.

31:33.570 --> 31:35.003
And is it?

31:35.171 --> 31:39.301
- Is this a war between good and evil?
- Yes, I think so.

31:40.343 --> 31:42.277
I'm not yet convinced.

31:42.712 --> 31:46.773
There may be neither good nor evil,
only degrees of savagery.

31:47.116 --> 31:50.142
No! You're wrong. There is a choice.

31:50.486 --> 31:53.853
And human beings must be allowed
to make that choice.

31:54.524 --> 31:57.960
I was chosen for this mission
because I didn't want it.

31:58.561 --> 32:00.222
I want to find hope.

32:00.663 --> 32:03.860
I want to see humankind grow
into a true civilization...

32:03.933 --> 32:06.299
into the great comity of planets.

32:06.369 --> 32:07.358
Trust me.

32:08.705 --> 32:11.299
And help me find a favorable answer.

32:11.674 --> 32:13.335
Will you trust me?

32:13.543 --> 32:15.374
Trust me to use my Golden Lasso...

32:15.445 --> 32:18.676
so that I may know
you're telling me the truth?

32:36.532 --> 32:39.365
- Have you told me the truth?
- Yes.

32:40.036 --> 32:44.029
If you judge Earth a danger or threat
to your Council of Planets...

32:44.574 --> 32:46.371
will you destroy it?

32:46.509 --> 32:49.535
- The Council will order it done.
- Can we stop you?

32:49.612 --> 32:51.239
No, I think not.

32:51.614 --> 32:53.411
And if you could...

32:53.483 --> 32:55.781
even though I'm monitored
by the Council...

32:55.852 --> 32:59.481
I must report via my spacecraft's comweb
every three of your days.

32:59.656 --> 33:03.786
If I am somehow killed or imprisoned
and the report is not made...

33:03.960 --> 33:06.724
an orbiting battle satellite
will instantly attack.

33:07.230 --> 33:09.994
And this planet will become
a barren cinder.

33:12.969 --> 33:15.164
I pray that will not happen.

33:17.573 --> 33:19.507
You've spoken the truth to me...

33:19.609 --> 33:22.669
but if it is necessary,
we will try to stop you.

33:24.213 --> 33:25.737
I understand.

33:26.049 --> 33:28.449
We can be honest with one other.

33:28.785 --> 33:30.776
We can trust one another.

33:31.921 --> 33:34.981
And for that I'm very grateful.

33:58.648 --> 33:59.637
Thanks, Harrison.

34:00.950 --> 34:03.441
Keep him covered.

34:07.824 --> 34:09.416
What's going on?

34:09.492 --> 34:12.393
I thought that Andros was free to go
anywhere he likes.

34:12.462 --> 34:15.487
That's right,
we're just keeping an eye on him.

34:16.766 --> 34:19.632
And this strike force to assassinate him.

34:19.735 --> 34:22.933
Only as a last resort.
In case he tries to harm us.

34:24.440 --> 34:28.001
If anything happens to Andros,
the Earth will be destroyed.

34:32.047 --> 34:35.540
Our only chance is to be honest with him,
to trust him...

34:35.918 --> 34:38.944
not to make a hopeless attempt
to murder him.

34:39.522 --> 34:42.889
My assignment
is a logical military alternative...

34:43.192 --> 34:44.887
and a patriotic necessity.

34:44.960 --> 34:49.762
To quote Dr. Samuel Johnson, "Patriotism
is the last refuge of scoundrels. "

34:51.234 --> 34:53.225
- Yeoman Prince.
- Yes, sir.

34:53.302 --> 34:55.496
- Dismissed.
- Aye-aye, sir.

35:02.278 --> 35:05.611
- Etta, this is confidential.
- Yes, sir. Absolutely.

35:11.487 --> 35:14.650
This is Strike Force, Alpha Wings, sir.
We've lost him.

36:23.693 --> 36:27.459
You realize that these humans
have armed soldiers following you?

36:27.563 --> 36:30.327
Yes, of course. I frighten them.

36:30.433 --> 36:33.925
But you still believe
they are capable of civilization?

36:34.737 --> 36:35.761
Yes.

36:38.074 --> 36:40.907
Then we have come to a decision, Andros.

36:41.444 --> 36:43.344
But the survey isn't complete.

36:43.412 --> 36:44.401
True.

36:44.614 --> 36:47.105
But we will refine the process.

36:47.583 --> 36:50.017
If these primitives attack you...

36:50.086 --> 36:51.781
we will not intervene to help.

36:52.421 --> 36:54.981
You will survive or die alone.

36:56.125 --> 36:57.649
I accept that.

36:58.127 --> 37:02.564
They're capable of suspicion,
but not mindless murder.

37:02.965 --> 37:05.490
But if they kill you, Andros...

37:05.568 --> 37:09.299
we'll destroy that planet
instantly and completely.

37:18.381 --> 37:20.781
No, I don't want a general alarm.

37:20.850 --> 37:23.444
How'd you lose him in the first place?

37:24.053 --> 37:25.680
Just keep looking.

37:33.162 --> 37:35.096
Diana, I have a problem.

37:35.598 --> 37:38.123
- I'm sorry, Mr. Bjornsen.
- Paul, please.

37:38.200 --> 37:39.792
Paul, what is it?

37:39.869 --> 37:41.632
It's a problem with Andros.

37:41.737 --> 37:44.501
I'm writing a feature about him
for my newspapers...

37:44.573 --> 37:47.440
but I have great respect for him,
and I want to be sure...

37:47.510 --> 37:51.469
- he is treated correctly.
- I approve of that, Paul.

37:52.148 --> 37:55.140
So I'd like to talk to him personally...

37:55.217 --> 37:57.981
and I need your help to get to him.

37:58.054 --> 38:00.579
I'm afraid that's impossible, Mr. Bjornsen.

38:00.656 --> 38:03.386
Major Trevor already told you
the matter is top-secret.

38:03.459 --> 38:07.589
I don't want to get any secrets,
just personal background.

38:08.097 --> 38:11.362
- I'm afraid not.
- But isn't it up to Andros?

38:11.667 --> 38:12.656
Possibly.

38:13.202 --> 38:14.829
Afternoon, Etta.

38:15.137 --> 38:18.004
I have to talk to you for a second
about Andros.

38:19.375 --> 38:21.900
Will you excuse us a moment?

38:23.612 --> 38:24.874
What is it?

38:24.947 --> 38:27.882
Steve wanted me to find you.
They've located Andros.

38:27.950 --> 38:31.442
He's in the Library of Congress,
reading old books of all things.

38:31.520 --> 38:33.988
We've sent one of our men
down there to watch him.

38:34.056 --> 38:36.115
Steve wanted you to go
and keep and eye on him.

38:36.192 --> 38:38.922
That way he wouldn't get too suspicious.

38:40.029 --> 38:43.055
- Something has come up.
- Of course.

38:43.132 --> 38:46.590
I understand. Wars have a way
of coming between people.

38:50.773 --> 38:53.367
Yes, we'll give each other a...

38:55.444 --> 38:57.435
- Rain check.
- A what?

38:57.513 --> 38:59.947
When you have to stop
in the middle of something...

39:00.016 --> 39:02.382
and you want to start again
as soon as possible.

39:03.285 --> 39:05.583
Yes, a rain check, it is.

39:06.122 --> 39:07.521
You've got it.

40:02.044 --> 40:03.306
Dr. Andros.

40:04.980 --> 40:06.845
You will come with us.

40:11.454 --> 40:14.048
Us meaning a Swedish news service?

40:14.457 --> 40:16.789
We can discuss that later.

41:26.462 --> 41:29.761
You believed in these savages.
You were wrong.

41:30.166 --> 41:32.600
- They haven't killed me.
- They will.

41:33.035 --> 41:35.833
We are canceling your power linkages.

41:35.905 --> 41:38.237
We are deactivating your power source.

41:38.741 --> 41:42.802
You trust these humans, you believe in
them, now you are no more than human.

41:42.912 --> 41:46.109
As vulnerable as they are.
As easy to harm.

41:57.159 --> 41:58.387
Take him.

42:16.045 --> 42:18.639
We agreed to remove Andros' powers...

42:18.714 --> 42:22.810
to test his belief in these humans,
but now...

42:23.185 --> 42:25.346
I'm afraid they will harm him.

42:25.888 --> 42:29.016
Then he dies by his own choice.

42:29.658 --> 42:32.593
And in dying he makes the decision final.

42:34.163 --> 42:36.927
To rid the planet of the human disease.

42:51.547 --> 42:54.345
Then notify the White House
they've got Andros.

42:54.416 --> 42:58.011
I want all the local police
and the FBI on this. Out.

42:58.454 --> 43:00.945
- How's Wonder Woman?
- Alive, barely.

43:02.291 --> 43:04.987
How does Paul Bjornsen figure in all this?

43:05.060 --> 43:07.824
We managed to grab one of his men.
He's talking now.

43:08.664 --> 43:11.189
He is a Nazi.
A deep spy planted years ago...

43:11.267 --> 43:13.758
until something important enough
came along.

43:15.938 --> 43:19.305
Can't think of anybody more important.
But don't worry, we'll get him.

43:19.375 --> 43:21.366
I got a description of the truck
they left in.

43:21.443 --> 43:24.412
It's being sent to every police force
from Florida to Nova Scotia.

43:24.480 --> 43:27.040
I realize a truck that size
can't manage some back roads.

43:27.116 --> 43:29.744
But this was planned
and I'm sure they'll change vehicles.

43:29.818 --> 43:32.912
I want a police checkpoint
on every road, track or cowpath...

43:32.988 --> 43:34.546
leading out of here. Is that clear?

43:35.457 --> 43:38.620
General, with your permission
I'd like to go the base clinic now.

43:39.094 --> 43:42.427
Of course, I'm praying for her, too.

43:58.914 --> 44:01.109
Etta, have you heard anything
about Wonder Woman?

44:01.183 --> 44:04.584
I just spoke to the doctor.
It seems she got hit by a poison gas.

44:04.653 --> 44:07.417
- They don't know what it is.
- What treatment are they using?

44:07.489 --> 44:09.013
There is no treatment.

44:09.091 --> 44:12.254
It seems she has an incredible ability
to throw off the poison.

44:12.528 --> 44:14.496
She's curing herself!

44:14.797 --> 44:17.357
They got Andros. Bjornsen.

44:17.633 --> 44:19.965
That's right. He's a Nazi agent.

44:20.135 --> 44:21.796
We've already rounded up some people...

44:21.870 --> 44:24.464
and the most massive search in history
is going on now.

44:25.140 --> 44:28.007
He must've had this
very carefully planned.

44:28.077 --> 44:29.942
Including the escape.

44:33.015 --> 44:35.108
We have to get Andros back.

44:35.551 --> 44:38.952
If the Council of Planets is monitoring
what's been happening...

44:39.021 --> 44:41.546
they might launch an attack on the Earth
and destroy it.

44:41.623 --> 44:43.784
We've got to find a way
to message to them...

44:43.859 --> 44:47.556
- to tell them we'll try to save Andros.
- But how can we do that?

44:48.364 --> 44:51.060
I know there's communication equipment
on the spaceship.

44:51.133 --> 44:53.567
We were never able to find the spaceship.

44:57.039 --> 44:58.267
Careful.

45:01.176 --> 45:02.438
I'm all right.

45:03.412 --> 45:07.405
I have to find the spacecraft
and a way to send that message.

45:08.384 --> 45:12.343
You can't go now. You've been poisoned.
It's much too early to leave the hospital.

45:12.721 --> 45:14.484
Steve, I'm going...

45:14.556 --> 45:17.491
to find the spacecraft myself.
I'm all right.

45:17.860 --> 45:21.421
We've searched that area a dozen times
and come up empty a dozen times.

45:21.563 --> 45:25.090
I know which direction he came from
and where he was first seen.

45:25.634 --> 45:29.092
I have to make one final search, for him.

45:30.539 --> 45:33.167
If I don't it might be fatal for Earth.

47:19.114 --> 47:22.914
One of the primitives is trying
to activate Andros' key control.

47:22.985 --> 47:24.509
Let her, Gorel.

47:24.586 --> 47:26.452
If the correct signal isn't set,

47:26.453 --> 47:29.319
the satellite would automatically
destroy their planet.

47:30.559 --> 47:32.254
We won't have to bother.

48:37.759 --> 48:38.748
