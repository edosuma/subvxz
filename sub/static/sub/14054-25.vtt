<i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>

00:03.719 --> 00:06.792
- Julie Cooper, will you marry me?
- Oh, my God.

00:06.960 --> 00:07.949
Was I mean to you 

00:08.119 --> 00:09.838
That would've required
you to speak to me.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.194
Lot's changed in a year, huh?

00:11.360 --> 00:13.669
- Are we really gonna do this?
- I think we already are.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.719
- He really loves me, Ryan.
- You ran away to get away from him.

00:16.880 --> 00:19.030
- Then you took off without calling?
- Like when you left Chino.

00:19.200 --> 00:21.509
- How'd it go with the liquor board?
- Working on it.

00:21.680 --> 00:24.069
As of today,
I'm the only chance your father has.

00:24.240 --> 00:26.595
You wouldn't want my mom to know
you blackmailed me into living with her?

00:26.920 --> 00:29.309
You know what we haven't done
in a while?

00:36.240 --> 00:37.798
- Two weeks.
- Sorry?

00:37.960 --> 00:40.872
Two weeks. Unbelievable.

00:41.040 --> 00:42.393
Who would believe it? I don't.

00:42.560 --> 00:46.155
It's the Tourette's flaring up again.
Happens now and again, but it's fine.

00:46.320 --> 00:48.880
Julie and Caleb's wedding invitation.
Getting married in...

00:49.040 --> 00:51.270
- Two weeks.
- Wow, they're really doing it.

00:51.440 --> 00:53.590
An unfortunate image just leapt
in my mind.

00:53.760 --> 00:56.149
I mean, I don't understand.
What is the rush?

00:56.320 --> 00:58.390
It's the gruesome twosome.
What do you expect?

00:58.560 --> 01:00.516
It's the shock-and-awe approach
to courtship.

01:00.880 --> 01:04.429
Julie Cooper's getting married
to my father and you're being flip.

01:04.599 --> 01:06.318
Me, being flip about Caleb?

01:06.480 --> 01:10.268
No. I'm kind of softening on the guy.
He may not be friendly or ethical...

01:10.440 --> 01:12.510
...or, you know, a million laughs.
- But he is...

01:12.680 --> 01:15.956
Generous. Well, either that
or he's in love and delusional...

01:16.120 --> 01:18.156
...because he threw out
a ballpark figure...

01:18.320 --> 01:21.039
...for what he's offering Jimmy and me
for the restaurant...

01:21.200 --> 01:23.873
...it ain't chump change.
- So he's bought your acceptance.

01:24.040 --> 01:25.553
But at a very high price.

01:25.720 --> 01:28.188
Hey, how's Marissa dealing
with her new stepdad?

01:28.720 --> 01:30.472
Yeah, is she all right with all that?

01:30.640 --> 01:33.279
- She's in the wedding. She agreed to that.
- And you two?

01:33.440 --> 01:35.908
You...
What, are you back to...?

01:36.160 --> 01:37.673
Yeah, yeah, we're good, actually.

01:37.840 --> 01:39.193
Really good.

01:39.360 --> 01:41.920
Really good for you is like singing
from the treetops.

01:42.080 --> 01:45.390
Now that you and Marissa are good,
does that mean you and Theresa are over?

01:45.560 --> 01:47.471
Yeah, yeah.
Me and Theresa, yeah.

01:47.640 --> 01:50.313
Well, now that we've got your
love life straightened out...

01:50.480 --> 01:52.869
...I think it might be time to take
a step back...

01:53.040 --> 01:55.508
...and untangle this incestuous web
I like to call...

01:55.680 --> 01:57.910
...the "Julie-Caleb union."
Let's think about this.

01:58.080 --> 02:01.675
When this bizarro knot gets tied, Julie
Cooper's gonna be your mother-in-law.

02:03.400 --> 02:05.231
Yeah, enjoy.
She's gonna be your stepmom.

02:05.400 --> 02:06.594
Seth, my head is spinning.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.910
Yeah. Yeah.
Me and Marissa, we could be related.

02:09.080 --> 02:10.308
I can't even do that math.

02:10.479 --> 02:13.836
But the real kicker is:
Julie Cooper, my grandma.

02:14.800 --> 02:16.791
My grandma wears Uggs.
Think about it.

02:16.960 --> 02:18.757
I am thinking about it.

02:19.280 --> 02:20.474
- Hello.
- Hi.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.312
It's Theresa, Ryan's friend.

02:22.480 --> 02:24.869
Oh, hey there. How are you?
Let me get him for you.

02:25.040 --> 02:27.190
<i>Actually, I'm calling for you.</i>

02:27.720 --> 02:30.109
I was wondering if maybe we could meet.

02:30.440 --> 02:34.956
- Are you all right?
- I just have a legal question.

02:35.120 --> 02:37.350
- Can we meet?
- Sure, you name the spot.

02:37.520 --> 02:39.909
I picked up some catering shifts
at the Balboa Bakery.

02:40.080 --> 02:42.150
I have a break at 1
if you want to stop by.

02:42.320 --> 02:44.550
- <i>And, Mr. Cohen, one more thing.</i>
- Yeah.

02:45.240 --> 02:47.595
Please don't say anything to Ryan
about any of this.

02:49.520 --> 02:50.873
You got it.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.712
I'll see you then.

03:30.880 --> 03:33.030
- Hello.
- I need one minute.

03:33.200 --> 03:35.555
You and me both.
You have no idea how hard it is...

03:35.720 --> 03:37.950
...to plan a spectacular wedding
in only two weeks.

03:38.120 --> 03:39.758
Mr. Lasser, could you repeat that?

03:39.920 --> 03:41.990
I have a caterer
who refuses to serve beef.

03:42.160 --> 03:44.469
Something about a mad cow
wiping out Newport Beach?

03:44.640 --> 03:46.949
- Julie, phone.
- Ironically, the minister I wanted...

03:47.120 --> 03:50.635
...is away on his honeymoon. My wedding
planner's a passive-aggressive nitwit...

03:50.800 --> 03:53.189
...who has the audacity to question
my taste in music.

03:53.360 --> 03:55.794
Bob Seger is not "so over."

03:55.960 --> 03:58.838
I'm going to have to call you back.

03:59.320 --> 04:01.834
- How can I help?
- Normally, I would never bother you.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.673
But there is one small thing
you can help me with: A shower.

04:04.840 --> 04:08.389
- And by "help," I mean "host."
- Julie, I can't host a shower.

04:08.560 --> 04:11.916
I know it's last-minute, but I thought
as my maid of honor, you'd want to.

04:12.080 --> 04:13.593
Wait.

04:13.760 --> 04:15.034
Your maid of honor?

04:15.200 --> 04:17.430
You're my closest friend.
Who else would it be?

04:17.600 --> 04:18.952
Well, I was thinking Marissa.

04:19.640 --> 04:21.437
I'm not Marissa's
favorite person right now.

04:21.600 --> 04:25.036
Caleb's convinced he can get her to help,
and he's made all the arrangements...

04:25.200 --> 04:26.599
...to have it at the club.

04:26.760 --> 04:28.671
- In that case...
- You're a godsend!

04:28.840 --> 04:32.628
Thank you. And one more thing: Let's not
have one of those tacky, girly showers...

04:32.800 --> 04:35.678
...with games about making whoopee.
- Don't say "whoopee."

04:35.840 --> 04:38.957
I was thinking a couples shower, elegant.
A cocktail party with gifts.

04:39.120 --> 04:41.953
What do you think?
Any other questions, just ask Marissa.

04:42.280 --> 04:43.793
Thanks.

04:50.560 --> 04:52.232
A couples shower?

04:52.400 --> 04:55.392
- What is a couples shower?
- Something I'm not throwing for my mom.

04:55.560 --> 04:58.552
That was a message from Caleb
saying that per our arrangement...

04:58.720 --> 05:00.870
...he wants me to help Kirsten
throw a shower for my mom.

05:01.200 --> 05:04.317
What about moving in with them?
Have you told your dad yet?

05:05.360 --> 05:07.590
No, but I will.

05:07.760 --> 05:10.911
- Today.
- Lf you don't want to throw this shower...

05:11.080 --> 05:14.755
...then don't. Stand your ground.
- Standing my ground isn't my strong suit.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.036
- That's true.
- Pac-Man. Rematch?

05:17.200 --> 05:20.397
Hey, I almost, maybe,
might beat you this time.

05:24.160 --> 05:25.718
What is it with those two?

05:25.880 --> 05:28.713
The Pac-Man and the getting along
and the happy times.

05:28.880 --> 05:31.474
They're playing video games.
It's not a Mandy Moore movie.

05:31.640 --> 05:34.393
She's supposed to be crying
and he's supposed to be brooding.

05:34.560 --> 05:36.869
- That's how it works.
- Hello?

05:37.040 --> 05:40.396
Hi. Yeah, we're still on for tonight.

05:40.680 --> 05:42.591
Fajitas? Yeah, okay.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.034
I'm gonna make the margs.

05:44.200 --> 05:46.395
Kidding. God. Oh, my God, I know.

05:46.560 --> 05:48.551
Oh, my God. No, you're so funny.

05:48.720 --> 05:51.234
No, you are. No, you.

05:51.400 --> 05:52.833
Okay, I'll see you later.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.479
Bye, Dad.

05:55.120 --> 05:57.350
Dad? That's how you talk to your dad?

05:57.560 --> 06:01.155
- How's how I talk to my dad?
- Like he's your friend.

06:01.320 --> 06:03.880
- He is. He's my best friend.
- Why have I never met him?

06:04.040 --> 06:05.598
I was wondering if you had parents.

06:05.760 --> 06:08.149
I thought you were made
in a lab or hatched in a pod.

06:08.320 --> 06:10.072
We haven't done
a family meet-and-greet.

06:10.240 --> 06:13.676
I know we haven't which is odd,
considering that you've met my dad...

06:13.840 --> 06:16.400
...you've met my mom, Captain Oats,
the list goes on.

06:16.560 --> 06:18.790
I've never introduced a boyfriend
to my dad before.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.234
It's kind of a big deal.

06:20.920 --> 06:23.388
Well, you're forgetting
one key factor here, Summer.

06:23.560 --> 06:24.788
Parents love me, okay?

06:24.960 --> 06:27.758
I've got this non-threatening,
non-sexual vibe they eat up.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.673
We'll go miniature golfing or hot-tubbing
or something fun.

06:30.840 --> 06:32.876
Well, my stepmom's at Canyon Ranch.

06:33.040 --> 06:36.032
- Drying out?
- No, some stress-management program.

06:36.200 --> 06:38.316
She has anxiety issues.

06:38.640 --> 06:39.993
So?

06:40.600 --> 06:42.431
- We can go to lunch with my dad.
- Nice.

06:42.600 --> 06:44.750
You sure you want to skip the hot tub?

06:44.960 --> 06:46.473
Okay, lunch is good.

06:46.640 --> 06:49.518
We'll do lunch. But your dad's
not going to need a menu...

06:49.680 --> 06:53.116
...because he's gonna be eating
out of the palm of my hand.

06:55.640 --> 06:58.200
The palm of my hand, Summer.

07:02.360 --> 07:03.998
Hey.

07:04.840 --> 07:06.910
Oh, my God.

07:07.080 --> 07:10.595
- Who did that to you?
- Sorry to call you out of the blue like this.

07:10.760 --> 07:14.753
- Was it Eddie?
- He's been under a lot of stress.

07:15.160 --> 07:18.311
He lost his job and his apartment.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.798
The other night,
he had a couple drinks, and he just...

07:22.960 --> 07:25.190
...went off.
- So you're leaving him, I hope.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.194
It's complicated.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.353
I know, it should be simple.

07:31.520 --> 07:33.829
Your boyfriend hits you,
you leave him, right?

07:34.520 --> 07:36.272
It's never simple.

07:36.560 --> 07:38.152
How can I help you?

07:38.320 --> 07:40.117
I just need to know, you know...

07:40.280 --> 07:43.511
...if he does this again, what would
happen to him if I pressed charges?

07:43.680 --> 07:46.717
It depends, anything from
a restraining order to jail time.

07:47.640 --> 07:49.995
You're not still thinking
about marrying the guy?

07:50.200 --> 07:53.192
Not if you gotta ask
these kinds of questions.

08:00.120 --> 08:02.998
So, you, me, my dad,
lunch tomorrow at the club.

08:03.160 --> 08:06.630
Awesome. By the end of this lunch,
I predict your father and I...

08:06.800 --> 08:09.758
...smoking Cuban cigars. Know
what I'm saying? Trading Viagra yuks.

08:09.920 --> 08:12.115
Maybe I'll put on a little Dean Martin.
I don't know.

08:12.280 --> 08:14.350
- You know he's not 75, right?
- I do know that...

08:14.520 --> 08:16.590
...but male bonding's a very
old-school activity.

08:16.760 --> 08:18.432
We may not make it through lunch.

08:18.600 --> 08:20.716
We may skip straight
over to the Russian baths.

08:20.880 --> 08:24.031
- Okay, tomorrow just sit under a light.
- What?

08:24.200 --> 08:26.270
Sit under a light.
He wants to see you better.

08:26.440 --> 08:28.510
Order steak.
He thinks greens are effeminate.

08:28.680 --> 08:31.114
Celery's gay, got it.
What else you got? I want to prep...

08:31.280 --> 08:34.033
...make sure I lock into
some witty anecdotes, my A material.

08:34.200 --> 08:36.873
- He's a plastic surgeon.
- I know what he does for a living...

08:37.039 --> 08:39.952
...and we can have fun with that,
but let's talk about hobbies.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.633
What do you guys talk about?

08:42.280 --> 08:43.554
Mostly we talk about me.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.150
- You?
- Yeah, it's like our common interest.

08:48.280 --> 08:50.157
- You wanted to meet him.
- I do. I do.

08:50.320 --> 08:53.153
I just was kind of hoping for some...
You know what I mean?

08:53.320 --> 08:54.673
Look...

08:55.480 --> 08:57.550
...my dad really loves me.

08:57.720 --> 08:59.597
And I really like you.

08:59.760 --> 09:02.558
So he's gonna really like you.

09:02.960 --> 09:05.428
- Right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.353
Yeah.

09:16.240 --> 09:17.832
We should go to the bedroom.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.513
Yeah.

09:21.680 --> 09:23.875
Oh, but Marissa,
she's gonna be home soon.

09:24.040 --> 09:27.589
- Right, right, right. We should...
- Yeah.

09:27.760 --> 09:30.593
I'm sorry. I'm sorry about all this
sneaking around.

09:30.760 --> 09:32.876
It's so incredibly high-school.

09:35.560 --> 09:37.039
Dad. Hailey?

09:37.680 --> 09:39.432
Hey, kiddo. Hi.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.594
Hailey was just over to help me fix my...

09:42.760 --> 09:44.796
- Faucet.
- My faucet, which is...

09:44.960 --> 09:49.909
Remember it was leaking? And, you know,
she's an expert on plumbing.

09:51.360 --> 09:52.634
- I should go.
- Okay.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.109
Now that the faucet is, you know, fixed.

09:55.280 --> 09:56.952
Okay. Listen, thank you so much.

09:57.120 --> 10:00.157
You know, if anything else breaks
then I'll give you a call.

10:00.320 --> 10:01.753
But thank you.

10:01.920 --> 10:03.433
- Bye.
- See you.

10:05.720 --> 10:08.393
Wow. You guys really need to work
on your improv skills.

10:08.560 --> 10:11.074
Look, I wanted to talk to you about it.
I did, but l...

10:11.240 --> 10:15.552
With your mom and Caleb, the last thing
you needed to deal with was this.

10:15.720 --> 10:18.314
Dad, I'm fine with it.

10:18.480 --> 10:22.519
You know what? Better than that,
I'm happy for you.

10:27.280 --> 10:28.872
What's the matter?

10:30.720 --> 10:33.996
It's just with Mom and Caleb
getting married...

10:34.160 --> 10:35.912
...and they're moving
into this new house...

10:36.080 --> 10:41.108
I know a lot is changing, kiddo,
but it's not all bad.

10:41.280 --> 10:43.475
- You know Caleb is buying the restaurant?
- I know.

10:43.640 --> 10:45.631
Yeah. And, you know,
we're gonna be okay.

10:45.800 --> 10:48.030
I mean, like, seriously okay.

10:48.200 --> 10:50.714
We're talking millions of dollars.

10:50.880 --> 10:55.112
We're gonna get out of this place,
move into a real home and start over.

10:57.160 --> 10:58.309
Isn't that great?

10:58.480 --> 11:01.199
Yeah. Yeah, it's great.

11:05.720 --> 11:08.280
- Seth's meeting your dad?
- Yeah, so?

11:08.440 --> 11:10.431
Well, that's gonna go well.

11:10.600 --> 11:13.512
Well, actually, Marissa,
it will go well. Do you know why?

11:13.680 --> 11:15.272
Turns out I'm great
with the parents.

11:15.440 --> 11:18.159
- I'm better with parents than daughters.
- I believe that.

11:18.320 --> 11:21.517
I think we know I'm pretty good
with the daughters. Know what I mean?

11:21.680 --> 11:24.319
This little one right here.
Her daddy's gonna feel it.

11:24.480 --> 11:26.948
- Yeah.
- I can't believe Eddie would hit her.

11:27.120 --> 11:31.432
I know. And Theresa has made it clear
she does not want to press charges.

11:31.600 --> 11:34.478
So unless she changes her mind,
there's only so much I can do.

11:34.640 --> 11:36.756
At least you gave her someone
to talk to...

11:36.920 --> 11:38.956
...somewhere to go. It's a start.

11:39.120 --> 11:42.476
Yeah, until she decides to go back
to Chino and marry the guy anyway.

11:42.640 --> 11:45.518
What about Ryan?
He must be beside himself.

11:45.680 --> 11:47.636
You wouldn't know it
from looking at him.

11:47.800 --> 11:49.233
- He doesn't know.
- What?

11:49.400 --> 11:51.550
Theresa had me promise
that I wouldn't tell him.

11:51.720 --> 11:54.632
She knows he'd fly off the handle.

11:54.800 --> 11:57.314
He'd go back to Chino
and beat the daylights out of Eddie.

11:57.480 --> 11:59.914
He breaks his probation
and he ends up back in juvie.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.194
Ryan, need something?
More soda?

12:04.360 --> 12:06.635
I got it. What's going on?

12:07.160 --> 12:08.912
Nothing.

12:10.320 --> 12:11.753
Nothing.

12:11.960 --> 12:13.791
Nothing. Okay.

12:22.920 --> 12:25.309
Come on, just pick one.
Marissa's gonna be here soon.

12:25.480 --> 12:27.436
Don't rush me.
I've got a lot riding on this.

12:27.600 --> 12:29.591
You said you were great with parents.

12:29.760 --> 12:33.548
Yeah, I've got so much experience being
introduced to my girlfriend's parents.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.438
Damn it, I'm being sarcastic.

12:35.600 --> 12:37.477
So? Sarcasm's like breathing for you.

12:37.640 --> 12:39.437
Her dad thinks it's a sign of weakness.

12:39.600 --> 12:41.989
- Sounds like a smart man.
- I have to fool him.

12:42.160 --> 12:45.197
Do you understand?
I have to spin an elaborate web of lies...

12:45.360 --> 12:47.669
...smoke and mirrors, for an entire meal.

12:47.840 --> 12:49.717
Only then can I earn his trust.

12:50.120 --> 12:52.953
- I hope you're not like this during lunch.
- This one? Too edgy?

12:53.120 --> 12:54.997
- Too fashion-forward?
- It's a white shirt.

12:55.160 --> 12:57.958
That's a good point.
White shirts make my teeth look yellow.

12:58.120 --> 13:01.556
That's Marissa. I've gotta go find her
before she runs into her mom.

13:09.160 --> 13:12.596
- Hey.
- Hey. Your mom's in there with Kirsten.

13:12.760 --> 13:17.151
- Maybe I'll come back later.
- No, you told Kirsten you'd stop by, right?

13:17.960 --> 13:21.191
I don't want to deal with my mom now.
All I want is to get back at her...

13:21.360 --> 13:25.035
...and here I am throwing her a party.
- It'll be fine. Just take the high road.

13:25.200 --> 13:26.838
- You can't lose.
- This looks great...

13:27.000 --> 13:29.673
...fruited Israeli couscous.

13:30.640 --> 13:33.359
- Oh, honey, hi.
- Hey.

13:33.520 --> 13:34.794
Thanks for coming.

13:34.960 --> 13:37.030
So you stopped by to help us, huh?

13:37.200 --> 13:41.113
Actually, Kirsten called me,
so I stopped by to help Kirsten.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.639
Well, then I'll let you get to it.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.711
- Kirsten. Ryan.
- Julie.

13:48.400 --> 13:50.436
- You okay?
- Fine.

13:50.600 --> 13:52.113
So, what can I do to help?

13:52.520 --> 13:54.715
Double check the guest list
with the invitations.

13:54.960 --> 13:58.157
I have everyone from The Newport Group,
all the ladies from spin class.

13:58.320 --> 14:02.711
- But there's no one from Julie's family.
- My mom and her parents don't speak.

14:02.880 --> 14:04.233
What about her sisters?

14:04.400 --> 14:06.118
Well, there's always Aunt Cindy.

14:08.200 --> 14:09.758
The caterers. Great.

14:09.920 --> 14:12.309
Aunt Cindy, you'll get in touch with her?

14:12.480 --> 14:13.959
Yeah.

14:16.120 --> 14:18.350
See? Take the high road.

14:18.520 --> 14:20.875
You've never met Aunt Cindy.

14:26.680 --> 14:27.954
Well.

14:28.120 --> 14:31.999
- It's... It's...
- It's more than twice what we put into it.

14:32.160 --> 14:35.197
Caught me at a good time. A man
in love has no right doing business.

14:35.360 --> 14:37.794
- Besides, we're family.
- Right. Are we? I don't know.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.030
- I can't keep track.
- Now, if you'll excuse me...

14:40.200 --> 14:42.998
...my fianc Áe wants help picking out
linens for the reception.

14:43.160 --> 14:45.628
I had no idea there were so many
shades of beige.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.590
All right, we'll see you.

14:51.480 --> 14:52.674
He's up to something.

14:52.840 --> 14:55.752
Either that or he's on some
serious painkillers.

14:55.920 --> 14:59.071
But you know what? I don't care.
Two and a half million dollars?

15:00.720 --> 15:02.278
I can finally breathe again.

15:02.440 --> 15:04.476
I'm happy for you.

15:05.200 --> 15:06.349
- But?
- Well...

15:06.520 --> 15:09.273
...I wish it could have been the place
that did it, not Caleb.

15:09.440 --> 15:12.910
I thought we'd be rescued by meat loaf
and dirty martinis.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.672
That's how it was supposed to be.

15:14.840 --> 15:17.991
Think about it. All that meat loaf
you'd be making? It's off your hands.

15:18.160 --> 15:19.479
Now you've got time for work.

15:19.720 --> 15:21.631
That's what I was trying
to get away from.

15:21.800 --> 15:23.028
No, no. I mean real work.

15:23.200 --> 15:24.792
The stuff that you love.

15:24.960 --> 15:27.155
Like rescuing kids...

15:27.320 --> 15:30.995
...and down-and-out guys who are
millions of dollars in debt.

15:31.160 --> 15:34.709
Come on, right now there's a stray
out there just waiting for you...

15:34.880 --> 15:37.872
...to swoop down and save the day.

15:38.920 --> 15:43.038
Remember, we are off-our-asses wasted
and totally lost in the woods...

15:43.200 --> 15:47.318
...and I gotta go like nobody's business,
so I end up dropping trou right there.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.869
Sure enough, poison oak everywhere.

15:50.040 --> 15:52.110
Julie tells the whole school.

15:52.280 --> 15:53.918
What a bitch, right?

15:54.080 --> 15:56.719
- Charming story.
- Yeah, good times.

15:56.880 --> 15:58.472
Mind if I smoke?

15:58.640 --> 16:00.995
- Actually, l...
- Sorry.

16:01.360 --> 16:04.397
I tried to quit once,
but I ended up putting on 30 pounds.

16:04.560 --> 16:06.949
And who wants to have sex
with that, right?

16:09.560 --> 16:13.075
Aunt Cindy. Look at you!

16:13.240 --> 16:15.356
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:15.520 --> 16:17.317
- So this is my boyfriend, Ryan.
- Hi.

16:17.480 --> 16:20.552
Cindy's been telling me some priceless
stories about your mom.

16:21.200 --> 16:23.794
Yeah, I was telling her about Julie's
Def Leppard phase.

16:23.960 --> 16:27.953
- She drove us to Anaheim to scalp tickets.
- I can't believe she was into heavy metal.

16:28.120 --> 16:32.079
- I can't believe she ever went to Anaheim.
- So where is the belle of the ball anyway?

16:32.240 --> 16:34.470
Doing yoga? Getting Botox?

16:35.160 --> 16:37.390
You and Julie, do you talk often?

16:37.560 --> 16:40.950
Sure, if you call once every
seven years often.

16:42.120 --> 16:45.556
Look, I'll hand it to you straight.
I was shocked she wanted me here.

16:45.720 --> 16:47.073
- You were?
- Yeah.

16:47.240 --> 16:51.279
Last time I saw her, and memory's a little
foggy on account of the Jell-O shots...

16:51.440 --> 16:54.671
...I'm pretty sure she told me to get lost,
for good.

16:56.680 --> 16:58.398
Marissa, can I talk to you in...?

16:58.920 --> 17:02.879
Oh, hi. I'm so sorry,
I don't mean to interrupt, but...

17:06.319 --> 17:10.676
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Well, it's nice to see you too.

17:10.839 --> 17:13.957
I'm here because I was invited
by Marissa.

17:16.440 --> 17:20.228
- Marissa, is this true?
- You guys have tons to catch up on...

17:20.400 --> 17:23.949
...so I'll give you some alone time.
- We should probably get that cake too.

17:24.119 --> 17:26.395
Right. Have fun.

17:33.200 --> 17:36.510
And I decided that I wanted to celebrate
both holidays, so what I did...

17:36.680 --> 17:39.478
...is, basically, I combined them,
and I made Chrismukkah.

17:41.320 --> 17:43.117
Like Christmas and Hanukkah.

17:43.280 --> 17:44.713
- Chrismukkah.
- Chrismukkah.

17:45.040 --> 17:47.918
Chrismukkah.
Well, that must be a lot of fun for you.

17:48.080 --> 17:51.550
Yeah, we have fun with it. But I don't
want you to think I'm all about...

17:51.720 --> 17:54.439
...holiday cheer,
I'm hoarding all of them or anything.

17:54.600 --> 17:56.238
I have interests. I have hobbies.

17:56.400 --> 17:57.628
- Do you?
- Sure, I do, sir.

17:57.960 --> 18:00.155
- Comic books, for one.
- Comic books.

18:00.560 --> 18:03.632
Sir, I think I hear the skepticism
in your tone.

18:03.800 --> 18:06.155
And I understand,
but I just want to tell you...

18:06.320 --> 18:10.154
...I believe the comic book is a legitimate
art form. Frank Miller's <i>Sin City</i>...

18:10.320 --> 18:11.514
...<i>Powers</i> by Brian Bendis...

18:11.680 --> 18:14.069
...arguably one of the best writers
in comics today.

18:14.240 --> 18:17.994
I mean, combines sort of the storytelling
panache of, like, a Stan Lee...

18:18.160 --> 18:20.833
...that old-school vibe,
but mixed with a lyrical...

18:21.000 --> 18:23.753
...you know, sophistication of...
I want to say Alan Moore.

18:23.920 --> 18:27.754
It's probably too inside for you. You're
probably a fan of the classics. Superman?

18:28.520 --> 18:31.080
Batman fan? No?

18:32.360 --> 18:33.998
Iceman?

18:34.800 --> 18:37.155
He freezes things.

18:38.240 --> 18:40.037
- So, Summer...
- Isn't Summer the best?

18:40.240 --> 18:43.232
Little force of nature, just sitting there.
Little live wire.

18:43.400 --> 18:46.358
- Yes, she is.
- I think she's so full of vim and vigor.

18:46.520 --> 18:48.988
What, in your surgical opinion,
does she have more of?

18:49.160 --> 18:51.310
Would you say it's vim or vigor?

18:51.480 --> 18:54.040
- Cohen, what are you talking about?
- Summer. Summer...

18:54.200 --> 18:58.079
...I'm just saying that I think you've been
extraordinarily blessed with vim.

18:58.240 --> 19:00.879
- And vigor too, sir.
- What do you say we order?

19:01.040 --> 19:02.473
Okay. I like food.

19:02.640 --> 19:04.119
Yes.

19:09.680 --> 19:12.240
So we just say that we're very
happy together.

19:12.400 --> 19:14.789
- We hope that they can be happy for us.
- Yeah.

19:14.960 --> 19:16.996
- You know?
- Easy.

19:20.080 --> 19:21.274
Hailey?

19:21.440 --> 19:22.873
The door?

19:23.360 --> 19:25.271
What if it isn't the right time...

19:25.440 --> 19:29.194
...because my dad's getting married to
Julie. And Kirsten's planning the shower...

19:29.360 --> 19:31.794
You know what? We should wait
until the timing's right.

19:31.960 --> 19:33.757
Know what I'm saying?
The timing's wrong.

19:33.920 --> 19:35.273
- Yeah.
- Right. Okay, good.

19:35.440 --> 19:37.032
- Okay, great.
- Excellent.

19:37.200 --> 19:38.633
This is a good idea too.

19:38.800 --> 19:40.711
- I'm so sorry.
- I feel so...

19:44.160 --> 19:46.151
Did you see the look on my mom's face?

19:46.320 --> 19:49.517
- So much for the high road.
- Yeah, this is way more fun.

19:49.920 --> 19:52.480
Hi, we're here to pick up
a cake for Cooper.

19:52.640 --> 19:54.631
- Let me check on that.
- Thanks.

19:59.040 --> 20:02.032
Oh, my God, this is amazing.
You've got to try this.

20:05.480 --> 20:07.471
- You need another piece.
- Stop!

20:13.360 --> 20:14.793
Theresa, what happened?

20:17.200 --> 20:18.792
- Eddie?
- I didn't want you involved.

20:18.960 --> 20:23.272
You weren't supposed to know I was
here. I guess Sandy told you anyway.

20:24.440 --> 20:26.192
Sandy...
Sandy knows about this?

20:35.680 --> 20:37.477
Hey, where have you been?

20:37.640 --> 20:40.234
I couldn't sleep.
I thought watching the sun come up...

20:40.400 --> 20:43.119
...and getting my ass kicked
by some 4-footers would help.

20:43.280 --> 20:44.269
It didn't.

20:44.440 --> 20:48.319
Here's that vanilla half-caf caramel
macchiato on the dry side you love.

20:48.480 --> 20:51.711
It's so good.
It's only 1500 calories per sip.

20:51.880 --> 20:54.917
- Hey, what time is that shower today?
- Why?

20:55.080 --> 20:58.914
- I might be late, depending on traffic.
- We live 10 minutes from the club.

20:59.080 --> 21:00.877
- I'll be coming from Chino.
- What?

21:01.120 --> 21:03.634
I want to pay Eddie a visit,
knock some sense into him.

21:04.400 --> 21:07.790
Metaphorically, of course.
At the very least, give him a good scare.

21:08.480 --> 21:11.392
- I'm taking back the coffee.
- People here need to hear from you.

21:11.560 --> 21:14.870
- Ryan is really upset.
- What can I do?

21:15.040 --> 21:17.235
- He won't talk to me.
- Explain it to him...

21:17.400 --> 21:20.392
...instead of trying to match him glare
for glare. What about Theresa?

21:20.720 --> 21:23.439
The victim, alone, in the motel room.

21:23.680 --> 21:25.557
She'd love to hear from you.

21:25.720 --> 21:28.075
Why don't you call her and invite her over.

21:28.240 --> 21:30.708
- You can keep the coffee.
- Thank you.

21:37.680 --> 21:40.592
I know you're pissed off.
I would have explained things to you...

21:40.760 --> 21:42.955
...but I couldn't
until Theresa gave me the okay.

21:43.120 --> 21:44.951
You guys decided to include me.
Thanks.

21:45.120 --> 21:47.475
I'm a lawyer. She asked for privacy,
she's entitled.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.517
She's getting beat up,
and you keep it from me?

21:49.680 --> 21:52.069
What if I had told you?
What are you gonna do?

21:52.240 --> 21:53.992
I don't know, help her.

21:54.160 --> 21:56.355
How? Go to Chino? See Eddie?

21:56.520 --> 21:59.671
Land in the hospital or jail or worse?
Theresa was protecting you.

21:59.840 --> 22:01.831
- You should have told me.
- Well, I didn't.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.639
Because I knew you'd get
riled up and do something stupid.

22:04.800 --> 22:06.472
Now that you do know...

22:06.640 --> 22:09.074
...I sure hope you don't prove me right.

22:09.360 --> 22:11.715
- What about Theresa?
- She's on her way here.

22:11.880 --> 22:13.996
If she's around people
that care about her...

22:14.160 --> 22:16.196
...she's less likely
to go back to him.

22:17.760 --> 22:21.196
- I gotta get ready for the shower.
- Do we understand each other?

22:26.840 --> 22:30.071
Hey, is your father around?
I didn't even see him.

22:30.240 --> 22:32.310
- Then I guess not.
- That's cool. I figured...

22:32.480 --> 22:34.948
...he'd maybe want to say hey.
Do you know where he is?

22:35.120 --> 22:37.190
No, didn't say.

22:38.120 --> 22:40.588
Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you.

22:40.760 --> 22:43.069
- Did he say anything about the lunch?
- Not really.

22:43.240 --> 22:46.312
No, I didn't think he would.
I mean, it got a little awkward there...

22:46.480 --> 22:49.199
...in the comic-book part.
I think it turned a good corner...

22:49.360 --> 22:51.749
...at, like, the bread basket.
- Bread basket?

22:51.920 --> 22:54.388
Yeah. Yeah, he asked me,
you know, to pass the bread.

22:54.560 --> 22:57.632
I said, "You'll wanna go bread stick
as opposed to dinner roll."

22:57.800 --> 22:59.597
He went bread stick.
Shows he trusts me.

22:59.760 --> 23:01.671
Didn't clock that.

23:03.400 --> 23:05.630
So I didn't even get
a review at all, huh?

23:05.800 --> 23:08.155
Not that I read my own press,
but, I mean...

23:08.320 --> 23:13.519
...nothing involving thumbs or stars or...
- We should go.

23:45.360 --> 23:47.430
You should have told me.

23:49.280 --> 23:50.793
Right.

23:51.320 --> 23:54.118
Because you would have taken
the news so well.

23:55.080 --> 23:57.196
You would have tried to kill him.

23:57.560 --> 23:59.391
He deserves it.

24:01.840 --> 24:04.070
Yeah, well, this is my problem.

24:04.240 --> 24:06.037
Not yours.

24:06.200 --> 24:08.316
I'm the one that has to figure
this thing out.

24:08.480 --> 24:10.630
What is there to figure out?

24:13.720 --> 24:15.676
You're not gonna stay with him?

24:16.360 --> 24:17.793
Right?

24:22.160 --> 24:24.799
I'll take some self-defense classes.

24:25.360 --> 24:27.715
And Eddie and I will live
happily ever after.

24:27.880 --> 24:31.759
- How can you joke?
- Because I'm tired of crying.

24:32.120 --> 24:33.678
Okay?

24:37.600 --> 24:40.114
- I haven't seen you like this in a while.
- What?

24:40.280 --> 24:41.998
Flustered? Upset?

24:42.160 --> 24:44.799
Heading to a Newport party
against my will?

24:44.960 --> 24:47.633
Passionate. Driven.

24:47.800 --> 24:49.836
This is the man I married.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.592
Oh, yeah?

24:51.760 --> 24:54.479
So are you ready
to face the happy couple?

24:54.640 --> 24:56.949
- The gruesome twosome?
- Yeah.

24:58.360 --> 24:59.793
- Hey.
- Hi.

25:00.080 --> 25:02.958
So, Theresa, I hope you've decided
to join us for the shower.

25:03.440 --> 25:05.749
Thanks, but I'm not really
looking my best.

25:05.920 --> 25:07.592
I have some concealer upstairs...

25:07.760 --> 25:09.273
...works like a magic wand.

25:09.440 --> 25:12.398
She's right.
You should see her without the stuff on.

25:12.560 --> 25:14.232
Terrifying.

25:14.720 --> 25:17.109
Hey, are you guys ready to go
to the shower?

25:19.760 --> 25:23.355
- Hey, Theresa.
- Theresa's in town for a while.

25:24.560 --> 25:26.790
Just till I get things straightened out.

25:26.960 --> 25:30.077
Of course. Well, then you
should come to the shower.

25:31.360 --> 25:33.032
Thanks.

25:43.720 --> 25:46.280
- Julie, congratulations.
- Thank you.

25:46.440 --> 25:50.228
- And, Kirsten, what a lovely party.
- Thank you.

25:52.160 --> 25:54.469
Is it too early to start drinking?

25:54.640 --> 25:57.279
I hope not, or I'm in trouble.
Thank you.

25:58.360 --> 26:02.353
After all your mom's been through,
she deserves a man like Caleb Nichol.

26:02.520 --> 26:06.638
You two will never have to worry
about money ever again.

26:06.800 --> 26:08.711
Will you excuse me?

26:14.040 --> 26:16.349
Which way is the ladies' room?

26:17.840 --> 26:19.558
Look at her...

26:19.720 --> 26:23.076
...flirting with her sister's boyfriend
like she's in seventh grade again.

26:23.240 --> 26:26.471
For once, I actually know what you mean.

26:27.920 --> 26:31.629
Wonder which of my past humiliations
she's telling him about now.

26:32.400 --> 26:36.154
Oh, my God.
Did she just say "monster truck"?

26:36.320 --> 26:37.753
You were into monster trucks?

26:37.920 --> 26:40.957
I better get over there
or there might not even be a wedding.

26:47.760 --> 26:49.637
Hey, Juju, your ears must be burning.

26:49.800 --> 26:53.793
I was telling Cal here about
you and me and Knott's Berry Farm.

26:54.440 --> 26:57.193
Cindy, thank you
for entertaining Cal here...

26:57.360 --> 26:59.191
...but you should go. Try the pastries.

26:59.520 --> 27:01.988
Maybe it'll soak up some of that whiskey.

27:03.520 --> 27:04.839
Does anybody want anything?

27:05.000 --> 27:07.116
- Tequila shooter?
- Cindy, go.

27:10.640 --> 27:12.915
I'm sorry about Cindy.

27:13.080 --> 27:14.798
She's got oomph. Spark.

27:14.960 --> 27:16.996
Just like her sister.

27:17.160 --> 27:19.754
Oh, and Julie looks fabulous.

27:19.920 --> 27:21.512
Must be all those Yogalates classes.

27:21.680 --> 27:24.638
Oh, you know,
I've always wanted to try Yogalates.

27:24.800 --> 27:26.631
- Really?
- Me too. Maybe we should...

27:26.800 --> 27:29.268
Maybe we'll take a class together,
you and I.

27:39.760 --> 27:41.193
Needed a break?

27:41.680 --> 27:43.511
Hey.

27:43.760 --> 27:46.638
Yeah. I was just feeling
a little lost out there.

27:48.320 --> 27:50.629
You probably really need Ryan right now.

27:50.800 --> 27:55.749
- Me being here, I'm getting in the way.
- Hey, it's not your fault.

27:55.920 --> 28:00.198
Look, part of the reason I didn't want
to tell Ryan about Eddie is because...

28:00.360 --> 28:02.396
...he seems really happy right now.

28:02.920 --> 28:04.990
And that's because of you.

28:05.280 --> 28:06.998
Look, Cal, a juicer.

28:07.760 --> 28:10.228
- I need one of these.
- How about a game?

28:13.040 --> 28:14.473
Okay, folks!

28:15.120 --> 28:20.399
Has anyone here ever played
"How Well Do You Know Them?"

28:20.560 --> 28:23.597
Cindy, everyone here already knows us.
That won't be much fun.

28:23.760 --> 28:25.637
All right,
I'm gonna be Chuck Woolery.

28:25.800 --> 28:27.438
I'm gonna ask a question...

28:27.600 --> 28:30.433
...and whoever shouts out the most
right answers, wins.

28:31.360 --> 28:35.592
First question:
What is Julie's favorite meal?

28:35.760 --> 28:38.911
Oh, I know this. Chilean sea bass
with roasted baby carrots.

28:39.080 --> 28:41.196
No. No, the answer is:

28:41.360 --> 28:43.555
Double-Double Cheeseburger,
heavy on the sauce...

28:43.720 --> 28:46.553
...large fries and an orange soda.
Okay, next question.

28:46.720 --> 28:49.314
Hi. I've been looking for you.

28:49.680 --> 28:51.750
For both of you.

28:53.920 --> 28:56.514
- Everything's okay?
- Yeah, it's just, at a shower.

28:56.680 --> 28:58.796
Not really what I do.

29:03.640 --> 29:06.996
- Is that him?
- Yeah, he's just calling to apologize again.

29:07.160 --> 29:09.628
- I'm not going to get it.
- You been talking to him?

29:13.200 --> 29:14.952
- Leave her alone.
- What are you doing?

29:15.120 --> 29:17.475
- What are you doing talking to him?
- Stay out of this.

29:17.640 --> 29:20.950
Stay out of it? You came here.
You knew I was gonna find out.

29:21.120 --> 29:24.317
What did you think I was gonna do?
He hit you. You can't go back to him.

29:24.480 --> 29:25.913
It's not that simple.

29:26.080 --> 29:28.594
You know him. He's not a bad person.
He made a mistake.

29:28.760 --> 29:30.637
- You don't really believe that.
- Yes, I do.

29:30.800 --> 29:32.870
- I know that.
- You're an expert on the subject?

29:33.040 --> 29:35.508
What are you gonna tell me?
This isn't the first time?

29:40.680 --> 29:42.557
Has he done it before?

29:44.080 --> 29:47.038
Tell me, Theresa.
Has he hit you before?

29:48.160 --> 29:49.878
Ryan.

29:53.480 --> 29:56.790
Growing up, who was Julie's first love?

29:57.520 --> 29:58.953
Rick Springfield?

29:59.120 --> 30:03.955
Close. The entire defensive line
of our eighth-grade football team.

30:04.120 --> 30:06.793
I refuse to sit here and be humiliated.

30:08.960 --> 30:10.154
Oh, crap.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.436
Hey, you're carrying a purse now?
Not that you shouldn't accessorize.

30:17.600 --> 30:18.874
You stealing Marissa's car?

30:19.040 --> 30:20.996
If I don't do something,
Theresa's gonna marry that guy.

30:21.160 --> 30:22.479
- You can't go.
- Yeah, why not?

30:22.640 --> 30:24.517
It's a horrible idea,
and my dad said not to.

30:24.680 --> 30:28.036
She's taking his calls. She's gonna
go back to him. It's gonna happen again.

30:28.200 --> 30:29.838
- Dude, don't.
- I don't have a choice.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.197
- Hey, man, you do.
- Let go of me. Now.

30:38.880 --> 30:41.713
- Is Ryan leaving?
- Yeah.

30:43.280 --> 30:44.554
Oh, he took your car.

30:58.360 --> 31:00.316
Put down the window.

31:02.520 --> 31:04.715
- Get out of the car.
- He's done it before.

31:04.880 --> 31:07.110
- Well, that's the pattern.
- He'll do it again.

31:07.280 --> 31:10.556
Don't try to fix this thing, kid.
I'm your guardian and I call the shots.

31:10.720 --> 31:12.836
- Get out of the car.
- Somebody has to stop him.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.879
Theresa has to decide on her own
to leave Eddie. We can't force her.

31:17.080 --> 31:20.436
I know about these things.
Theresa, Eddie, Chino.

31:20.600 --> 31:22.113
- You don't get it.
- Oh, yes, I do.

31:22.280 --> 31:24.714
I've seen too many kids just like him,
and I know...

31:24.880 --> 31:27.030
...it will not be you to suddenly
make him change.

31:27.200 --> 31:29.350
- So you want me to do nothing?
- Yes.

31:31.480 --> 31:33.198
I can't do that.

31:41.040 --> 31:42.871
Thank you very much.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.958
That was quite a scene out there, huh?

31:49.240 --> 31:51.435
I'll always love Cindy.

31:54.360 --> 31:58.194
So do you wanna talk about this?

31:58.360 --> 32:00.351
I know it's weird.

32:00.520 --> 32:03.910
Even though it was years ago
you and I dated, she's still your sister.

32:05.080 --> 32:08.914
It's not jealousy. I just don't want to see
my friend make a terrible mistake.

32:09.080 --> 32:12.755
- What makes you think it's a mistake?
- Jimmy, this is what Hailey does.

32:12.920 --> 32:14.876
She uses people to get back at me.

32:16.760 --> 32:18.512
Kirsten...

32:20.120 --> 32:23.476
...this isn't about you.

32:25.520 --> 32:29.229
Hailey and I, you know, it feels real.

32:30.840 --> 32:32.671
Okay.

32:33.880 --> 32:35.472
It's just that...

32:35.640 --> 32:37.278
...you're starting to do well...

32:37.440 --> 32:40.830
...and I don't want to see you...
- Happy? Because that's what I am.

32:42.160 --> 32:45.755
It's the first time since Julie left me
I don't feel completely alone.

32:45.920 --> 32:47.478
So...

32:48.000 --> 32:50.309
...just be happy for me, okay?

32:53.360 --> 32:54.952
Okay.

33:08.720 --> 33:10.472
What do you want, Cindy? Money?

33:11.800 --> 33:14.997
- I don't want your money.
- The hell you don't.

33:15.160 --> 33:18.675
Why else would you come down here
and humiliate me in front of my friends?

33:19.000 --> 33:21.753
Those people aren't your friends.
They don't even know you.

33:21.920 --> 33:24.480
- And you do?
- I used to.

33:25.360 --> 33:28.796
Back when you had big hair
and you wore tight jeans.

33:28.960 --> 33:32.919
We were supposed
to leave Riverside together, remember?

33:33.080 --> 33:37.995
We were gonna move to L.A.
And marry rock stars.

33:39.600 --> 33:41.670
Then you took off.

33:42.200 --> 33:43.918
And you moved to the beach...

33:44.080 --> 33:45.832
...without me.

33:47.240 --> 33:50.198
I couldn't exactly take you with me.

33:53.080 --> 33:54.672
I know.

33:55.960 --> 33:57.313
I just...

33:57.960 --> 34:01.077
I miss you sometimes, that's all.

34:12.120 --> 34:15.668
I'm sorry about what happened out there.

34:16.040 --> 34:18.349
Guess I won't be invited
to the wedding, huh?

34:18.520 --> 34:20.431
Of course you'll be invited
to the wedding.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.750
We wouldn't have it any other way.

34:22.920 --> 34:24.751
Thanks.

34:25.719 --> 34:27.199
I'll be outside.

34:30.840 --> 34:34.071
Well, I'm sure you found Cindy's visit
very revealing.

34:36.760 --> 34:39.911
Julie, there is nothing
I could find out about you...

34:40.080 --> 34:41.559
...that would make me walk away.

34:54.239 --> 34:57.072
Hey, you're avoiding me.

34:57.720 --> 34:59.472
That's cool.
I kind of like it.

34:59.640 --> 35:02.518
It's kind of a throwback.
It feels very eighth-grade.

35:05.880 --> 35:09.873
So I'm guessing
that this has something to do...

35:10.680 --> 35:13.433
...with me bombing with your father.
- It was a train wreck.

35:13.600 --> 35:15.955
- I was nervous.
- You didn't stop talking.

35:16.120 --> 35:18.714
I know. I get chatty when I'm...

35:18.880 --> 35:20.199
...completely terrified.

35:20.680 --> 35:24.195
Look, next time I'll be...
I'll be the strong silent type.

35:24.520 --> 35:27.796
Or I'll just be silent, okay?

35:28.560 --> 35:30.232
Look, my dad and I are best friends.

35:30.400 --> 35:32.868
We've been through everything together.

35:33.480 --> 35:35.948
And he's never been wrong.
I mean, he's my dad.

35:36.120 --> 35:38.554
- And he hated me?
- You just weren't what he expected.

35:38.720 --> 35:40.995
Yeah? What was he expecting?
Someone taller?

35:41.160 --> 35:44.152
- Blonder? Presbyterian? What?
- Just different.

35:44.320 --> 35:45.958
My dad's really protective of me.

35:46.120 --> 35:50.193
Look, I'm sorry if your dad doesn't think
I'm good enough for you. Really, I am.

35:50.360 --> 35:53.796
If that's the way he feels, that sucks.
But you know what? It doesn't matter.

35:53.960 --> 35:58.272
I don't really have to be his type, because
the only thing that matters is me and you.

35:58.440 --> 35:59.919
Right?

36:06.640 --> 36:08.756
I have to go.

36:26.840 --> 36:28.478
I thought you'd be in Chino by now.

36:28.760 --> 36:30.671
I got as far as Corona.

36:31.360 --> 36:32.918
And?

36:33.240 --> 36:36.357
And I realized Eddie wasn't
who I needed to talk to.

36:37.720 --> 36:41.554
- What are you doing going back to him?
- It won't happen again. He promised.

36:41.720 --> 36:44.792
- Like he promised the last time, right?
- What am I supposed to do?

36:44.960 --> 36:47.235
- My whole life is in Chino.
- So was mine.

36:47.400 --> 36:50.119
Right, so I wait for some rich,
perfect family to adopt me...

36:50.280 --> 36:52.919
...and stick me
in their beautiful pool house? Great idea.

36:53.080 --> 36:55.310
- You can stay with the Cohens too.
- No, I can't.

36:55.480 --> 36:56.959
- Why not?
- Because...

36:57.120 --> 36:59.031
...I move in there and then what happens?

36:59.200 --> 37:00.713
I don't know.

37:01.120 --> 37:02.519
I don't know.

37:04.240 --> 37:06.595
I know what happens
if you go back to Eddie.

37:07.720 --> 37:09.358
So do you.

37:12.760 --> 37:14.955
I am never throwing another party again.

37:15.120 --> 37:16.758
Oh, honey, don't tease.

37:16.920 --> 37:19.832
Nothing good happens at our parties.
Have you noticed that?

37:20.640 --> 37:21.914
Yeah, the gruesome twosome...

37:22.080 --> 37:25.550
...never tighter.
- Jimmy and Hailey, officially a couple.

37:25.720 --> 37:28.598
And Ryan's probably heading back
to juvie right about now.

37:28.760 --> 37:30.034
And if he is...

37:30.200 --> 37:32.668
...I know just the guy to get him out.

37:34.080 --> 37:36.275
- Hi.
- Hey, you all right?

37:36.680 --> 37:38.033
How's Eddie?

37:38.200 --> 37:41.431
I decided to take my lawyer's advice
and went to see Theresa instead.

37:42.040 --> 37:44.395
Hi, Mr. Cohen. Mrs. Cohen.

37:45.400 --> 37:47.630
- You can stay as long as you want.
- Thank you.

37:47.800 --> 37:49.313
You can sleep in the pool house.

37:49.480 --> 37:51.948
Ryan, you can bunk in with Seth,
on the air mattress.

37:52.120 --> 37:54.509
Come on.
Why don't we get you settled in.

38:03.960 --> 38:05.393
Thanks for doing this.

38:05.880 --> 38:07.711
Kirsten and I would do anything for you.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.718
Yeah, me too.

38:10.200 --> 38:12.350
Well, I'm glad to hear it...

38:12.520 --> 38:14.033
...because we lost the pump.

38:14.200 --> 38:16.873
So somebody's gonna have
to blow that sucker up.

38:26.040 --> 38:28.679
- Hey, Marissa.
- Hey, Kirsten. Is Ryan home?

38:28.840 --> 38:31.149
Yeah, he's in the pool house.

38:31.320 --> 38:34.676
He's helping Theresa get settled in.

38:34.840 --> 38:36.193
So she's staying?

38:36.920 --> 38:38.433
Yeah.

38:39.480 --> 38:41.391
He loves you, you know.

38:42.080 --> 38:46.312
- I know.
- Then make room for her to be in his life.

38:46.680 --> 38:48.636
He's not going anywhere.

39:09.960 --> 39:12.428
Sorry I bailed on the shower.

39:14.240 --> 39:17.471
Don't you think this apology
should be directed elsewhere...

39:17.640 --> 39:19.153
...like, say, Marissa?

39:21.840 --> 39:23.319
I guess so.

39:25.600 --> 39:27.556
I didn't want to, I had to...

39:27.720 --> 39:30.075
Again, should be directed
somewhere else.

39:35.320 --> 39:38.278
If it makes you feel any better,
things between me and Summer suck.

39:38.440 --> 39:41.273
- Because of her dad?
- Of all the love triangles to sink us...

39:41.440 --> 39:43.351
...it is the least sexy.

39:45.920 --> 39:48.832
Go talk to your girlfriend.
One of us should be able to.

39:49.880 --> 39:51.279
Right.

40:19.800 --> 40:21.552
Hi.

40:25.120 --> 40:28.510
Today I said I was gonna be there,
and I wasn't.

40:29.720 --> 40:31.472
It's okay.

40:32.440 --> 40:35.034
And I know you got a lot
to deal with coming up.

40:35.200 --> 40:37.111
But we're gonna get through it...

40:37.280 --> 40:38.679
...together.

40:39.400 --> 40:40.992
You and me, we're gonna be fine.

40:42.920 --> 40:44.512
I...

40:50.520 --> 40:51.953
What?

40:53.800 --> 40:55.916
I think we are gonna be fine.
