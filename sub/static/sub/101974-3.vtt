09:50.406 --> 09:52.048
Surely we can separate the two.

09:55.920 --> 09:56.986
GIL:
Talk to me.

09:57.088 --> 09:59.413
Well, there are two crimes.

09:59.433 --> 10:00.247
One is a prank.

10:00.309 --> 10:01.991
Elaborate yet childish.

10:02.052 --> 10:04.085
And the other is a murder.

10:04.187 --> 10:06.012
This is a case of teen brain.

10:06.106 --> 10:06.771
JESSICA:
Teen brain?

10:06.964 --> 10:08.331
You're kidding.

10:09.300 --> 10:11.985
-He's kidding, isn't he?
-Not usually.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.279
Explain teen brain.

10:14.472 --> 10:16.522
It's the psychological state
of adolescence.

10:16.658 --> 10:19.359
The frontal cortex of a typical
teenager is underdeveloped.

10:19.511 --> 10:21.435
They can't weigh the
consequences of their actions.

10:21.496 --> 10:23.788
And I thought it was
all the spiced rum I drank.

10:23.981 --> 10:25.248
Not here, of course.

10:26.785 --> 10:29.794
Adolescence is also when
certain mental disorders

10:29.987 --> 10:30.903
can surface,

10:30.964 --> 10:32.279
even psychopathy.

10:32.341 --> 10:33.873
Combine teen brain with that

10:33.967 --> 10:35.375
and you get something

10:35.527 --> 10:37.385
a lot worse than a hangover.

You'd think, right?

16:30.365 --> 16:32.715
But, funny story--

16:32.734 --> 16:36.235
I saw it
when I went to school here.

16:36.387 --> 16:40.314
He kept it in a lockbox
in his desk. You know the one.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.225
It's floating in the pool.

It's called survival.

18:24.979 --> 18:27.680
I have one more question.

18:27.832 --> 18:30.483
Did you talk about this

you don't let someone

Your femoral artery might be
a bit difficult to reach

I'm up for rooting around

34:46.442 --> 34:48.418

34:48.587 --> 34:50.754
But your carotid and brachial
arteries are...

34:50.923 --> 34:52.255
easily accessible.

34:52.424 --> 34:55.333
Several short stabs.

No.

His college.

35:37.177 --> 35:40.387
Right into a job at his firm.

35:42.257 --> 35:44.975
-Not anymore.
-Running away

35:45.168 --> 35:46.918
won't solve anything.

35:47.070 --> 35:48.145
It'll solve one thing.

35:48.338 --> 35:50.221
I'll never have to see
my father again.

35:50.315 --> 35:52.798
But you'll still be
his daughter,

35:52.860 --> 35:54.376
and you'll still be a killer.

35:54.436 --> 35:55.968
(chuckles):
A killer? No, no.

35:56.029 --> 35:58.155

-Martin...
-Hands against the wall.

No, he's a Judas!
Don't trust him!

36:22.890 --> 36:25.089
He's a Judas!

36:25.184 --> 36:26.741
Better watch your back, Surgeon.

36:26.801 --> 36:29.352
Better watch your back!

36:30.564 --> 36:32.439
You shouldn't have come back.

36:38.238 --> 36:39.654
I'm sorry.

36:46.246 --> 36:47.746
I get it.

36:50.209 --> 36:52.417

Asthma.

Looking for this?

37:28.622 --> 37:30.989
(inhaling sharply)

37:31.083 --> 37:33.808
It's empty.

37:33.868 --> 37:34.918

sensed it.

38:36.264 --> 38:38.523
The killer inside.

38:40.360 --> 38:42.986
That's the real reason
he expelled me.

39:03.383 --> 39:06.509
Remind me why I'm still
talking to you.

39:06.661 --> 39:09.721
Because Professor Delaney's iron
needed time to heat up.

39:11.892 --> 39:13.016
Sorry, Mr. Marlowe.

(sizzling)

39:15.002 --> 39:16.335
What are you doing?

39:16.355 --> 39:18.855
There must be a fire suppression
system in here.

39:19.006 --> 39:20.582
An alarm?

39:20.642 --> 39:24.277
Yeah. It'll remove all

-Guys...

Oh, a whole minute?
Come on, Gil.

40:30.470 --> 40:32.286
Can't we just jump to the end?

40:32.380 --> 40:34.764
You say,
"A fire? You started a fire

40:34.957 --> 40:38.326
in an airtight vault?
Have you completely lost it?"

40:38.344 --> 40:39.769
That's a little performative,
but sure.

40:39.962 --> 40:43.164
-Boss, can I, can I just...
-And then I remind you

40:43.224 --> 40:44.774
that you arrested Louisa.

Of course, I wish that you had

-I'm sorry.

41:34.201 --> 41:35.533
Excuse me?

I accused you of something
that you didn't do.

41:40.707 --> 41:42.415

Okay.

Here we are.
You're apologizing to me.

problematic.

42:13.089 --> 42:14.513

Problematic doesn't get you
chained to a wall.

Oh, no, I meant problematic
in the sense that

42:19.353 --> 42:20.686
I'm not all bad.

42:20.789 --> 42:23.039
And that was your mistake
at Remington.

42:23.190 --> 42:25.449
You should have owned
your last name.
