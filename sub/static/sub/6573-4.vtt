00:11.136 --> 00:13.381
Michael Bluth
was starting a new job

00:13.501 --> 00:16.337
when he received a call
from attorney Barry Zuckerkorn.

00:16.457 --> 00:18.084
Hello. Michael Bluth,
residential complexes.

00:18.126 --> 00:19.445
Take a picture of this!

00:19.565 --> 00:20.242
Hey, Michael.

00:20.337 --> 00:22.297
- You're in real estate again?
- Sort of.

00:22.339 --> 00:24.758
Michael had tried
to leave real estate behind

00:24.800 --> 00:26.301
and get a job
in the high-tech sector.

00:26.343 --> 00:27.594
However...

00:27.636 --> 00:29.680
I will tell you
that in my last position,

00:29.721 --> 00:31.640
I had a company car provision.

00:31.682 --> 00:34.143
I think we may have something
that can get you a car.

00:34.184 --> 00:35.727
- Hey, Gare-Bear?
- Yeah?

00:35.769 --> 00:37.479
I think we got an ostrich.

00:37.521 --> 00:39.106
- Oh, God, grab him.
- What is it?

00:39.148 --> 00:42.484
Now, with this car,
you may get some stares.

00:42.526 --> 00:44.444
I'm used to a car
with some stairs.

00:44.486 --> 00:46.196
Albeit one that had trouble

00:46.238 --> 00:50.117
negotiating
low-hanging obstacles.

00:53.912 --> 00:56.874
Which is why
he'd parted with it.

00:56.915 --> 00:58.458
I'm actually working
in high tech,

00:58.500 --> 01:00.127
but it does collide
with real estate.

01:00.169 --> 01:03.130
This is going to be low.

01:03.172 --> 01:04.464
Ah, I hooked it.

01:04.506 --> 01:05.507
Michael was driving a car

01:05.549 --> 01:06.842
from a company that shows

01:06.884 --> 01:09.178
every private residence
in the country.

01:09.219 --> 01:12.389
But it's also a company
that won't let us

01:12.431 --> 01:14.516
show the car
that takes those pictures.

01:14.558 --> 01:17.186
In fairness to them,
it is their property.

01:18.645 --> 01:20.365
If you want to know
what the company is...

01:20.397 --> 01:22.117
Save it. We're just
going to blur it anyway.

01:22.149 --> 01:23.317
...all you have to do is...

01:23.358 --> 01:24.063
"something" it.

01:24.253 --> 01:25.420
Barry, you still there?

01:25.462 --> 01:27.881
So I got a really
interesting call

01:27.923 --> 01:30.050
from Ron Howard, of all people.

01:30.092 --> 01:31.760
He's directing now, apparently,

01:31.802 --> 01:33.428
and wants to meet you
at his office

01:33.470 --> 01:35.889
in-- get this-- Beverly Hills.

01:35.931 --> 01:37.266
Why does Ron How...

01:37.307 --> 01:39.309
Why does Ron Howard want
to meet with me?

01:39.350 --> 01:41.186
Oh, I didn't know. His office
didn't say, and if you

01:41.228 --> 01:43.146
don't mind, I'm a little busy
with a case of my own.

01:43.188 --> 01:45.107
Did you get
any other information?

01:45.148 --> 01:47.401
Apparently, he directed
a movie called Cocoon.

01:47.442 --> 01:48.986
Sorry. I was unclear

01:49.027 --> 01:50.863
about why he wants
to meet with me.

01:50.904 --> 01:52.531
I don't know. You want me to
tell him to go  himself?

01:52.573 --> 01:54.533
I can tell Ron Howard
to go  himself.

01:54.575 --> 01:56.285
Tell him to shove it
up his.

01:56.326 --> 01:57.578
I just can't do it now

01:57.619 --> 01:59.413
because I'm in front of a jury.

01:59.454 --> 02:00.914
Barry, I will meet with him.

02:00.956 --> 02:02.374
You're in front of a jury
right now?

02:02.416 --> 02:04.251
Oh, and the looks I'm getting.
Got to go.

02:04.293 --> 02:06.128
Sorry, everybody.
I'm an attorney, too.

02:06.169 --> 02:08.255
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

02:08.297 --> 02:11.008
I'd like the defendant
to reach over the school gate,

02:11.049 --> 02:12.426
open it from the inside

02:12.467 --> 02:14.386
and enter the school
property, please.

02:14.428 --> 02:17.514
I can't reach it.
I can't reach the knob.

02:17.556 --> 02:19.266
Why is that,
Mr. Zuckerkorn?

02:19.308 --> 02:21.226
- I'm not tall enough.
- You're not tall enough.

02:21.268 --> 02:23.186
I can't reach the chotchie.

02:23.228 --> 02:24.897
Hey, should I try tippy-toe?

02:24.938 --> 02:26.440
Look, I'm on tippy-toes.

02:26.481 --> 02:28.400
If he can't reach,
this trial's a breach.

02:28.442 --> 02:30.986
Ooh, and that's what
we call a Law Bomb.

02:31.028 --> 02:32.362
That's a low blow, Loblaw.

02:32.404 --> 02:33.614
A Bob Loblaw Law Bomb.

02:36.658 --> 02:38.285
Now the story

02:38.327 --> 02:40.078
of a wealthy family
who lost everything

02:40.120 --> 02:42.247
and the one son
who had no choice

02:42.289 --> 02:44.374
but to keep them all together.

02:49.922 --> 02:51.506
It's...

02:53.634 --> 02:56.427
Michael drove to the
North American headquarters

02:56.470 --> 02:58.096
of Imagine Entertainment,

02:58.138 --> 03:00.891
the modest television
and streaming colossus

03:00.933 --> 03:03.268
of Brian Grazer and Ron Howard.

03:03.310 --> 03:06.897
And got his first taste
of how cruel Hollywood can be.

03:06.939 --> 03:08.815
That's not very nice.

03:08.857 --> 03:11.151
"Ankles" means "leaves"
in Variety, Michael.

03:11.193 --> 03:14.279
Kitty Sanchez.
What are you doing here?

03:14.321 --> 03:15.989
I work here. I'm a "D" girl.

03:16.031 --> 03:17.616
No, I don't want to see them.

03:17.658 --> 03:20.494
I'm not going to show you
my , you pig.

03:20.535 --> 03:22.162
It means "development."

03:22.204 --> 03:24.915
I'm a movie executive.
I work for Ron Howard now.

03:24.957 --> 03:27.918
And she'd proven
as loyal to him as she was

03:27.960 --> 03:30.461
to her former boss,
Michael's father.

03:30.504 --> 03:33.382
But without the
quote, unquote "benefits."

03:33.423 --> 03:36.134
Also, Imagine provided
no health benefits.

03:36.176 --> 03:38.053
Great for you.
How'd you get this job?

03:38.095 --> 03:41.056
Women can be movie executives,
you pig. I knew people.

03:41.098 --> 03:43.392
You're probably going to call me
a pig for this, too,

03:43.433 --> 03:46.019
but are you sure that
you meant to say "knew"?

03:46.061 --> 03:47.479
She did.

03:47.521 --> 03:49.201
The only thing at Imagine
that Kitty blew

03:49.231 --> 03:52.067
was smoke up the skirt
of the young woman

03:52.109 --> 03:54.945
who hired her,
Michael's niece, Maeby,

03:54.987 --> 03:57.280
who was then working
as a film executive.

03:57.322 --> 03:59.199
My first project
is about my family.

03:59.241 --> 04:00.534
Ooh!

04:00.575 --> 04:01.576
Yeah, which is why I thought
you'd be a perfect assistant--

04:01.618 --> 04:03.495
because you know where
all the bodies are buried.

04:03.537 --> 04:05.247
And I even helped
bury some of them.

04:05.288 --> 04:07.499
Maeby was only 17 at the time.

04:07.541 --> 04:09.209
Also, um, can you buy me booze?

04:09.251 --> 04:10.460
Totally.

04:11.920 --> 04:13.505
Whatever else, too.

04:13.547 --> 04:16.216
'Cause I can get you smack
or hash or Special K...

04:16.257 --> 04:19.094
Unfortunately,
when Maeby was shooting

04:19.136 --> 04:23.932
out of town on a picture,
Kitty saw to it...

04:23.974 --> 04:25.976
She didn't even get releases
from her family.

04:26.018 --> 04:27.519
that Maeby's was one
of the bodies that was buried.

04:27.561 --> 04:29.312
And I begged her to.

04:29.354 --> 04:31.440
And the project got thrown
on the back burner.

04:31.481 --> 04:34.234
Do you have any idea
why Ron Howard wants to see me?

04:34.276 --> 04:36.570
Believe me, if I could
think like Ron Howard,

04:36.611 --> 04:39.281
I'd own the second largest
building in Beverly Hills.

04:39.322 --> 04:41.241
Only Jerry Bruckheimer's
building

04:41.283 --> 04:42.993
was technically taller.

04:43.035 --> 04:44.536
But who wants to be
south of Wilshire?

04:44.578 --> 04:46.371
Mr. Howard will see you now.

04:46.413 --> 04:48.665
- Oh, great.
- I'll take you to the private elevator.

04:48.707 --> 04:51.585
- Thanks.
- Ooh! Going to meet the big man himself.

04:51.626 --> 04:54.713
But first, Michael would have
to pass a few little Rons.

04:54.755 --> 04:56.006
Michael Bluth.

04:56.048 --> 04:58.341
- Hey.
- Hey, nice try, mister.

04:58.383 --> 05:00.343
We're never going
to beat the original.

05:00.385 --> 05:01.928
- Well, that's what I've been saying.
- Hi. Hey.

05:01.970 --> 05:03.555
- Oh, Michael. Hey, thanks
for coming down. - How are you?

05:03.597 --> 05:05.098
- Pleasure to meet you.
- I'm just finishing up

05:05.140 --> 05:06.391
casting this
Andy Griffith Show thing.

05:06.433 --> 05:07.601
Okay. Yeah.

05:07.642 --> 05:09.019
Hang on a second.

05:09.061 --> 05:10.422
You guys finally
making that movie?

05:10.437 --> 05:12.278
I've been reading about it
for, like, 40 years.

05:12.314 --> 05:14.149
Well, it's not a done deal yet,

05:14.191 --> 05:15.711
- but I want to talk about you.
- Yeah.

05:15.734 --> 05:17.402
Hey, let's go inside the LEM.

05:17.444 --> 05:19.404
- You want to?
- Wow. Is this the one

05:19.446 --> 05:20.614
that landed on the moon?

05:20.655 --> 05:21.990
On a soundstage.

05:22.032 --> 05:23.492
Oh, right, from Apollo 13.

05:23.533 --> 05:25.202
No, no, 1969.

05:25.243 --> 05:27.120
I'll tell you about it
inside the LEM.

05:27.162 --> 05:28.663
It's soundproof in there.

05:28.705 --> 05:30.582
And it's a national secret.

05:30.624 --> 05:33.293
So, NASA did go to the moon
in '71.

05:33.335 --> 05:35.087
That one was real.

05:35.128 --> 05:37.380
But in '69, they weren't ready,

05:37.422 --> 05:41.259
so they faked the whole thing
on the soundstage of Gentle Ben.

05:41.301 --> 05:42.385
- Boy.
- Me and my brother,

05:42.427 --> 05:44.096
we hid up in the rafters.

05:44.137 --> 05:45.514
- We seen the whole thing.
- Ah.

05:45.555 --> 05:47.307
But I want to talk to
you about something.

05:47.349 --> 05:49.017
Okay.

05:49.059 --> 05:51.478
For the last year, I've
been going to Phoenix.

05:51.520 --> 05:53.647
Whoa, whoa. Hang on, now.

05:53.688 --> 05:55.148
Are you kidding me?

05:55.190 --> 05:56.817
I'm a... I'm a Phoenix.

05:56.858 --> 05:59.236
I've-I've never... I've never
met anyone else in person

05:59.277 --> 06:00.557
that, uh...
that also goes there.

06:00.570 --> 06:02.197
That's amazing.

06:02.239 --> 06:04.449
I guess that's the downside
of going to college online, huh?

06:04.491 --> 06:06.535
Well, I... I just got
a sick aunt down there.

06:06.576 --> 06:08.703
- Oh, I see.
- But on the last flight,

06:08.745 --> 06:10.497
I was flipping
through the magazine,

06:10.539 --> 06:12.290
- and I... I saw something.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

06:12.332 --> 06:14.126
Not-not...
not the begging photo.

06:14.167 --> 06:15.752
Now, I don't think
you know this about me,

06:15.794 --> 06:18.588
but most of my movies are based

06:18.629 --> 06:20.674
on still photographs
that I find truly inspiring.

06:20.715 --> 06:22.217
It was true.

06:22.259 --> 06:24.177
Splash was based
on what turned out

06:24.219 --> 06:26.263
to be a counterfeit Hockney

06:26.304 --> 06:28.639
that Brian talked Ron
into buying.

06:28.682 --> 06:32.102
The Da Vinci Code
was from this photo.

06:32.144 --> 06:33.812
You know Willow?

06:33.854 --> 06:37.065
That was from a Soft 'n Snuggly
coupon I got in the mail.

06:37.107 --> 06:39.109
But a man who is
passionate enough

06:39.151 --> 06:41.528
to beg, well, that's a character

06:41.570 --> 06:43.780
whose story we really want
to see.

06:43.822 --> 06:45.615
- Really?
- Plus I've been dying to figure out

06:45.656 --> 06:47.658
a way to do something
about the market crash

06:47.701 --> 06:49.701
ever since my partner,
Brian Grazer, was tipped off

06:49.703 --> 06:51.413
that it was three months
away from happening.

06:51.454 --> 06:52.663
What's that?

06:52.706 --> 06:54.499
But I never had a face
to put on it.

06:54.541 --> 06:56.459
Until now. You.

06:56.501 --> 06:58.503
Your wife is dying.

06:58.545 --> 07:00.255
You're trying to hold
your family together.

07:00.297 --> 07:02.090
Oh, gosh, no, no, no.

07:02.132 --> 07:05.260
My wife died years before
any... any of this.

07:05.302 --> 07:07.345
Oh, gee.

07:09.097 --> 07:11.516
I think it's a lot more fun
if we see her die.

07:11.558 --> 07:13.226
- That is fun.
- And by the way,

07:13.268 --> 07:16.479
then it's a fantastic part
for a leading lady.

07:16.521 --> 07:19.232
In fact, my girl Rebel
would be great in that part.

07:19.274 --> 07:20.483
Your girl?

07:20.525 --> 07:21.693
Rebel Alley.

07:21.735 --> 07:22.819
She's an actress.
You know her.

07:22.861 --> 07:24.196
He didn't.

07:24.237 --> 07:25.530
I do.
Yes, of course I do.

07:25.572 --> 07:27.073
Your girl, huh?

07:27.115 --> 07:29.367
Well, we kind of like
to keep that quiet.

07:29.409 --> 07:30.744
Michael assumed
that by "my girl,"

07:30.785 --> 07:32.370
Ron was referring
to his mistress...

07:32.412 --> 07:34.539
I can see why you're
telling me in the LEM, huh?

07:34.581 --> 07:38.293
...but Ron was actually
talking about his daughter.

07:38.335 --> 07:41.463
You probably think I'm terrible
for even mentioning her to you.

07:41.504 --> 07:43.381
Oh, no, no,
I'm-I'm not one to judge.

07:43.423 --> 07:45.634
I'm sure you've all got girls
up here in Hollywood, huh?

07:45.675 --> 07:47.802
Brian's got two boys.

07:50.263 --> 07:52.641
I think you're a natural
and it could be a great movie.

07:52.682 --> 07:54.226
You know, and-and
it's a real chance

07:54.267 --> 07:55.518
to show you guys off, too.

07:55.560 --> 07:56.770
Us guys?

07:56.811 --> 07:59.231
Well, it's about
the whole family.

07:59.272 --> 08:00.732
Them?

08:00.774 --> 08:02.275
We're going to need
everybody's signature

08:02.317 --> 08:05.153
on these releases in order
to make this story.

08:05.195 --> 08:06.655
Although the real
heartbeat of this thing

08:06.696 --> 08:08.156
is the father-son dynamic.

08:08.198 --> 08:09.491
Yeah. You know, Ron,

08:09.532 --> 08:11.409
I-I don't know if I can do this.

08:11.451 --> 08:13.453
We're not in a great way
right now,

08:13.495 --> 08:15.330
and-and it might not
be worth...

08:15.372 --> 08:17.791
Michael, take a few of these
cards and really think about it.

08:17.832 --> 08:19.793
- All right.
- Yeah, man, I got a tough meeting coming up now.

08:19.834 --> 08:23.713
How do you tell Ed Harris
that he's simply not a Barney?

08:23.755 --> 08:26.758
And while Ed was
getting some bad news,

08:26.800 --> 08:28.593
Michael got some good news.

08:28.635 --> 08:30.220
Excuse me.
Uh, is this a mistake?

08:30.262 --> 08:31.513
Am I a producer?

08:31.554 --> 08:32.764
It's one of the perks

08:32.806 --> 08:34.390
of having a movie
made about you.

08:34.432 --> 08:36.308
Huh.

08:36.351 --> 08:38.602
Health plan is not
another one, by the way.

08:38.645 --> 08:40.647
There's no health plan.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.110
Michael had been given
an opportunity

08:45.151 --> 08:48.238
to turn his life around,
and all he had to do

08:48.280 --> 08:50.198
to make it happen was to get

08:50.240 --> 08:52.075
- his family's signatures.
- ...the family signatures,

08:52.117 --> 08:54.744
especially my father's.

08:54.786 --> 08:56.162
Wow, sounds like your thing

08:56.204 --> 08:57.497
went a lot better
than my thing.

08:57.539 --> 09:00.292
Except I haven't spoken
to them for a long time.

09:00.333 --> 09:03.503
I mean, since I...
well, since-since my mom...

09:03.545 --> 09:05.130
Left?

09:05.171 --> 09:06.756
Yeah, for prison, yeah.

09:06.798 --> 09:08.258
You want to know what?

09:08.300 --> 09:09.718
Frankly, I think Ron Howard

09:09.759 --> 09:12.137
just wants to get a movie
for his girlfriend.

09:12.178 --> 09:14.347
Oh, it sounds like Ron Howard
is casting with his.

09:14.389 --> 09:16.182
Well...

09:16.224 --> 09:19.144
it is hard to believe,
but I guess they've all got

09:19.185 --> 09:21.479
their mistresses up here
in showbiz, you know.

09:21.521 --> 09:23.273
It's like it's
their God-given...

09:23.315 --> 09:25.400
Front?
No, right.

09:25.442 --> 09:27.193
- No, right.
- Calm down, everybody, all right?

09:27.235 --> 09:28.796
- I got it. I got it.
- You think my dad

09:28.820 --> 09:30.530
would ever even go
for something like this?

09:30.572 --> 09:32.824
You know, it's very hard
to get a signature out of him.

09:32.866 --> 09:34.659
It's... it's like somebody
a long time ago said...

09:34.701 --> 09:36.494
Hey, what if you never
signed anything

09:36.536 --> 09:38.371
because you said you didn't
have a signature?

09:38.413 --> 09:40.623
- Just like you, Pop.
- You... you don't have a signature?

09:40.665 --> 09:42.250
No, and he's never
given me one card.

09:42.292 --> 09:43.668
Not one birthday
card, which is why

09:43.710 --> 09:45.086
his presents are
always money orders.

09:45.128 --> 09:46.296
Right, Pop?

09:46.338 --> 09:48.423
- I don't have a signature.
- Oh!

09:48.465 --> 09:50.258
If you don't sign,
you will be fine.

09:50.300 --> 09:51.634
Hey.

09:51.676 --> 09:53.178
He's very smart.

09:53.219 --> 09:54.888
He's very good.

09:54.929 --> 09:56.514
Can you feel your hands?

09:56.556 --> 09:58.516
I can't feel my pinky
or this one.

09:58.558 --> 10:00.268
You know what, Barry?
I hear what you're saying.

10:00.310 --> 10:02.187
I... My dad would never do
something like this for me.

10:02.228 --> 10:03.730
I'm going to head back in,
and I'm going to...

10:03.772 --> 10:05.565
I'm going to tell Ron Howard
to forget about it.

10:05.607 --> 10:06.733
- Yeah, you're screwed.
Hey, do me a favor. - Yeah.

10:06.775 --> 10:07.776
- Tell Ron Howard to go
- Okay.

10:07.817 --> 10:09.378
- shove his...
- Bye-bye, Barry.

10:09.402 --> 10:11.696
- Oh!
- Sorry. Whoops.

10:11.738 --> 10:12.781
Whoa. Sorry.
That was my fault.

10:12.822 --> 10:14.407
- No.
- I was looking at my phone.

10:14.449 --> 10:15.658
It's not too embarrassing
walking around

10:15.700 --> 10:17.285
with a bunch of photographs
of yourself.

10:17.327 --> 10:19.162
Oh, well, looks like
it's part of your job, huh?

10:19.204 --> 10:22.207
- You're an actress?
- No, I'm a narcissist.

10:22.248 --> 10:24.667
Yeah, actually, "actress"
is an overstatement because...

10:24.709 --> 10:26.252
Ugh. Thank you.

10:26.294 --> 10:28.380
I was just sucking at
this audition I went on.

10:28.421 --> 10:31.383
It was one of these ridiculous
meet-cute clichés,

10:31.424 --> 10:33.510
where a guy and a girl
just, you know...

10:33.551 --> 10:35.720
they bump into each
other, and they...

10:35.762 --> 10:37.680
they fall in love.

10:37.722 --> 10:40.308
God, you're handsome.

10:40.350 --> 10:42.560
I got a...
maybe a lucky hair day.

10:42.602 --> 10:43.895
You're the beautiful one.

10:43.937 --> 10:46.731
You have beautiful eyes.

10:46.773 --> 10:49.776
My deceased wife had red hair.

10:49.818 --> 10:51.694
Yep, garbage like that.

10:51.736 --> 10:53.696
And it's so unbelievable.

10:53.738 --> 10:55.299
Like, they never get
each other's names.

10:55.323 --> 10:57.325
Pretty stupid. Whoops. Gosh.

10:57.367 --> 10:59.285
- Oh... oh! Ow!
- Oh! Are you okay?

10:59.327 --> 11:00.727
- That really hurt.
- Ooh. You okay?

11:00.745 --> 11:02.414
I wish I had done that
well in the audition.

11:02.455 --> 11:05.834
Where's a movie producer
when you need one, right?

11:05.875 --> 11:07.460
Well, it was really
nice to meet you.

11:07.502 --> 11:08.962
Yes, you, too.

11:10.004 --> 11:11.464
I'm a "moobie" producer.

11:11.506 --> 11:12.841
Sorry. I'm a movie...

11:12.882 --> 11:14.300
Here, I've got...

11:14.342 --> 11:16.302
I've got proof here, huh?

11:16.344 --> 11:17.679
- Oh, you are a movie producer.
- Yeah.

11:17.720 --> 11:19.597
Yeah, there's a part
for a wife,

11:19.639 --> 11:21.599
and you'd be perfect
for the movie.

11:23.768 --> 11:25.687
Do you like Scottish music?

11:25.728 --> 11:28.398
Uh, with the screeching horns
and the silly...

11:28.440 --> 11:30.400
Yeah. I'm in a band.

11:30.442 --> 11:32.235
I love it. It's great.

11:32.277 --> 11:33.903
We're playing at the Ealing
Club tomorrow night, and...

11:33.944 --> 11:35.946
maybe you could come and...
and just check it out.

11:35.989 --> 11:37.948
Oh, yeah?
I don't even know what that is.

11:39.325 --> 11:40.618
I should've... Sorry.

11:40.660 --> 11:41.870
That's funny.
I should have said "where."

11:41.911 --> 11:43.455
Of course, I know what it is.

11:43.496 --> 11:45.039
No, it's on the top
of that building.

11:45.081 --> 11:47.459
- Okay.
- But can you imagine driving that car?

11:47.500 --> 11:49.752
No, I can't. No.

11:49.794 --> 11:52.505
It wasn't until
Michael had walked

11:52.547 --> 11:55.049
two blocks past the
California Pizza Kitchen

11:55.091 --> 11:56.551
when this happened.

11:56.593 --> 11:58.428
♪ Hey, I met a girl today ♪

11:58.470 --> 11:59.637
♪ And her name is... ♪

12:01.014 --> 12:03.974
So Michael went back
to find her

12:04.017 --> 12:06.057
or, at the very least,
try looking for a head shot

12:06.060 --> 12:08.521
- with her name on it.
- Nothing, huh?

12:08.563 --> 12:09.439
She was super-pretty,
red hair...

12:09.481 --> 12:10.607
But even without her name,

12:10.648 --> 12:12.650
he knew his only chance
with her

12:12.692 --> 12:14.486
was to be a real producer,
and that meant

12:14.527 --> 12:16.946
getting a signature
from a father whose face

12:16.987 --> 12:17.947
he hadn't seen in ages.

12:17.988 --> 12:19.282
Oh, you're making me dizzy!

12:19.324 --> 12:20.950
And that's when he
suddenly did.

12:20.991 --> 12:22.952
We have
to keep this quiet!

12:22.993 --> 12:24.746
Dad?

12:24.787 --> 12:27.749
No, no.

12:27.790 --> 12:29.792
- Hi.
- Don't say I'm down here.

12:29.834 --> 12:31.878
- Right here.
- Hey.

12:31.920 --> 12:33.796
What's going on?

12:33.838 --> 12:35.423
I just came back to get, uh...

12:35.465 --> 12:36.674
Don't acknowledge me.

12:36.716 --> 12:38.468
...get some suits, you know,

12:38.510 --> 12:40.720
so I can look like the uptight,

12:40.762 --> 12:43.556
dishonest, cheating boob
that I am.

12:43.598 --> 12:45.850
Well, I never said "boob."

12:45.892 --> 12:47.936
Although you are in
the wrong Lucille's apartment,

12:47.977 --> 12:50.355
so unless you're looking
for a Bob Mackie original,

12:50.396 --> 12:51.898
could be some truth
to the cheating part.

12:51.940 --> 12:53.566
Yeah, well, I was
in the desert,

12:53.608 --> 12:54.943
and I've lost my
sense of direction.

12:54.984 --> 12:56.585
Hey. Where you going?

12:56.611 --> 12:57.820
Dad.

12:58.821 --> 13:00.448
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

13:00.490 --> 13:01.658
Listen.

13:01.699 --> 13:03.409
You're getting divorced.

13:03.451 --> 13:05.578
I am not one to judge.

13:06.871 --> 13:08.498
Great to see you again.

13:08.540 --> 13:10.500
The past is the past, and
things have worked out,

13:10.542 --> 13:12.544
and I've met a
wonderful woman named...

13:12.585 --> 13:15.964
Don't worry about that,
but I'm a movie producer now.

13:16.005 --> 13:17.840
Unbelievable.

13:17.882 --> 13:20.510
They're making a movie
out of my life.

13:20.552 --> 13:22.554
The girl I met is perfect
to play my wife.

13:22.595 --> 13:24.347
And it's... I don't know.

13:24.389 --> 13:26.474
Can you believe it?
And I know what you're thinking:

13:26.516 --> 13:28.768
- "Can you put me in it?"
- I don't care.

13:28.810 --> 13:30.019
Do I have what I hope I've got?

13:30.060 --> 13:31.479
Anybody who's getting
in the movie

13:31.521 --> 13:33.022
needs to sign this.

13:33.063 --> 13:34.857
It's a simple signature.

13:34.899 --> 13:36.442
I think that everybody
needs to see

13:36.484 --> 13:37.819
who the real George
Sr. is, don't you?

13:37.860 --> 13:42.365
I think it would all depend
on how George Sr. was portrayed.

13:42.407 --> 13:43.866
Well...

13:43.908 --> 13:48.913
he is not the most
positive character, but...

13:48.955 --> 13:51.874
you sign this, and I
don't see any reason

13:51.916 --> 13:55.044
why we can't make him
seem very, very, uh...

13:55.085 --> 13:56.838
uh, you know...

13:56.879 --> 13:59.424
uh...

13:59.465 --> 14:01.426
uh...

14:01.467 --> 14:03.386
uh...

14:09.183 --> 14:10.977
...nice.

14:11.019 --> 14:12.854
- Go to hell.
- Huh?

14:12.895 --> 14:14.897
Michael was actually relieved.

14:14.939 --> 14:16.065
You go to hell.

14:16.106 --> 14:17.984
He had no idea how he was

14:18.026 --> 14:20.028
going to make
his father seem nice.

14:22.322 --> 14:24.324
Michael Bluth
was starting his new life

14:24.365 --> 14:27.368
as a producer in-- get this--
Beverly Hills

14:27.410 --> 14:30.830
without the signature
he needed to make it happen.

14:30.872 --> 14:33.458
Your office is only
one floor below Ron Howard's.

14:33.499 --> 14:35.209
Oh, yeah?

14:35.251 --> 14:38.212
Must be a pretty important
project to him, then, huh?

14:38.254 --> 14:40.757
That's one possibility.

14:40.798 --> 14:42.800
Watch your head.

14:42.842 --> 14:44.719
Are these ceilings
a little lower?

14:44.761 --> 14:46.512
Brian and Ron
wanted the ceiling

14:46.554 --> 14:49.265
in their office to be
a few inches taller,

14:49.307 --> 14:51.225
but, apparently, Bruckheimer
knows someone on city council

14:51.267 --> 14:53.227
and they wouldn't let them
make the building taller.

14:53.269 --> 14:54.812
So Ron said,
" you, Jerry,"

14:54.854 --> 14:57.231
and he went lower
with his floor.

14:57.273 --> 14:58.941
Everybody wins, huh?

14:58.983 --> 15:01.402
- Here we are.
- Oh. That's me, huh?

15:01.444 --> 15:03.780
Oh. Ceilings
are even lower in here.

15:03.821 --> 15:06.699
Yeah, your office
is right below Brian's.

15:06.741 --> 15:08.326
He wanted his ceiling

15:08.368 --> 15:09.869
just a few inches
taller than Ron's.

15:09.911 --> 15:11.913
- Okay.
- Some internal competition.

15:11.954 --> 15:13.956
- Kind of like between us.
- Yeah.

15:13.998 --> 15:17.377
- Wait, what?
- Well, you have a family to track down.

15:17.418 --> 15:19.462
Yeah, I do.
Hey, speaking of that...

15:19.504 --> 15:22.548
Kitty, is there... is there
a directory of actresses,

15:22.590 --> 15:24.550
- with pictures in it, that I could...
- Wow.

15:24.592 --> 15:26.511
Starting with the
casting couch already.

15:26.552 --> 15:27.804
No, no, no, no.
Nothing like that.

15:27.845 --> 15:29.389
I met... I met this
unbelievable woman

15:29.430 --> 15:31.265
that would be perfect
for the part of my wife.

15:31.307 --> 15:32.850
And even if she isn't, I'd love

15:32.892 --> 15:34.394
to track her down, so...

15:34.435 --> 15:36.229
an actual couch could
be useful, please.

15:36.270 --> 15:37.438
Okay, you're funny.

15:37.480 --> 15:38.680
This is Imagine Entertainment,

15:38.690 --> 15:40.692
not the hot tub
at Bruckheimer Tower.

15:40.733 --> 15:42.485
We make family movies,

15:42.527 --> 15:43.986
you
 pig.

15:44.028 --> 15:46.239
- Okay.
- So, why don't you not worry

15:46.280 --> 15:48.366
about casting your movie,
and instead just get

15:48.408 --> 15:49.951
the rights to your family,
and, of course,

15:49.992 --> 15:52.745
if you need any help at all,
I would love to help you.

15:52.787 --> 15:54.580
- We like to pull together around here.
- Watch your back.

15:54.622 --> 15:56.582
No, you watch your back, mister!

15:56.624 --> 15:58.292
If you screw up
this project for me,

15:58.334 --> 16:00.253
I will bury you
farther underground

16:00.294 --> 16:02.463
than I did your illiterate
little niece!

16:02.505 --> 16:04.298
Hi, guys.

16:04.340 --> 16:06.509
With Michael's movie
in jeopardy

16:06.551 --> 16:09.929
over the rights,
he decided to call in a favor.

16:09.971 --> 16:11.681
You know, we're making a movie

16:11.723 --> 16:13.307
about the family, and I thought,

16:13.349 --> 16:14.600
"I wonder if Carl Weathers

16:14.642 --> 16:16.227
would be willing
to help me out."

16:16.269 --> 16:18.396
- Let me ask you this right up front.
- Okay.

16:18.438 --> 16:20.857
Do you think
anybody would be upset

16:20.898 --> 16:23.276
if one of these Crinch
dolls took a walk?

16:23.317 --> 16:25.820
No, no, no, no, help yourself.

16:25.862 --> 16:27.363
I know what you're thinking.

16:27.405 --> 16:29.490
"What part
would I play in this?"

16:29.532 --> 16:31.534
I figured you'd
want me to play me.

16:31.576 --> 16:34.036
Well, I... I didn't want
to waste you on you.

16:34.078 --> 16:35.913
In fact, I wasn't even going
to talk to you about acting,

16:35.955 --> 16:38.040
but if you are game,
boy, that would be great.

16:38.082 --> 16:39.417
Let's circle back to that.

16:39.459 --> 16:41.377
There's a television show,
was it,

16:41.419 --> 16:43.880
that you made about my family.

16:43.921 --> 16:46.883
Michael was referring
to the George Bluth Sr. episode

16:46.924 --> 16:50.094
of a horribly narrated
crime reenactment series

16:50.136 --> 16:51.763
called Scandalmakers

16:51.804 --> 16:53.848
that Carl had directed
years earlier.

16:53.890 --> 16:56.267
Did you retain the rights
to my father's story?

16:56.309 --> 16:57.894
Nah, man, rights cost money.

16:57.935 --> 16:59.353
I never bothered
with that stuff.

16:59.395 --> 17:00.563
I figure you go ahead,
you shoot it.

17:00.605 --> 17:03.524
Better to ask for forgiveness
than beg for permission.

17:03.566 --> 17:05.443
As it turned out, Carl

17:05.484 --> 17:07.612
had never bothered
to get either,

17:07.653 --> 17:09.405
which is why he made himself
the subject

17:09.446 --> 17:11.866
of the final episode
of the series.

17:11.907 --> 17:14.868
Lee Nails, only pressed on once.

17:14.911 --> 17:16.871
Carl, we're at a swap meet.

17:16.913 --> 17:18.664
Okay.
There he is.

17:18.705 --> 17:20.500
- Carl Weathers.
- Mr. Weathers-- Carl Weathers.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.752
You've been accused
of producing a television show

17:22.794 --> 17:24.796
based on real-life events
for which you've done

17:24.837 --> 17:28.966
none of the due diligence
in securing the rights thereto.

17:29.008 --> 17:30.676
I only have one question.

17:30.718 --> 17:32.011
Can I have your rights?

17:32.053 --> 17:33.513
- Of course.
- Of course, Carl Weathers.

17:33.554 --> 17:34.889
Cut!

17:34.931 --> 17:36.724
Now we'll move on,
do a little voice-over.

17:36.766 --> 17:37.850
How much are these belts?

17:37.892 --> 17:39.685
- Oh, oh, oh, God.
- DeBrie!

17:39.727 --> 17:41.437
Her heart stopped.
She's  dying.

17:41.479 --> 17:43.648
Oh, hey, Dave,
you shaved, I like it.

17:43.689 --> 17:45.107
Please get the paddles!

17:45.149 --> 17:46.901
Oh, hey, Mike.
How was Ojai?

17:46.943 --> 17:48.361
But, Carl, the whole point

17:48.402 --> 17:50.029
of the movie is that
it's a true story,

17:50.071 --> 17:51.113
so I need the rights.

17:51.155 --> 17:52.657
Don't I?

17:52.698 --> 17:56.035
Man, you're as green
as old lady Crinch.

17:56.077 --> 17:59.330
Come on, people don't go
to movies to see rights.

17:59.372 --> 18:01.415
People go to movies
to see actors.

18:01.457 --> 18:03.459
Now, who you got
as scriptwriter?

18:03.501 --> 18:04.544
And that's
when Michael remembered

18:04.585 --> 18:06.587
that he did know one member

18:06.629 --> 18:08.673
- of the Writers Guild.
- The eye is falling off this one.

18:08.714 --> 18:11.384
You mind if I swap it out,
you know, for the restaurant?

18:11.425 --> 18:12.510
Swap it.

18:12.552 --> 18:13.761
And I thought, who's going

18:13.803 --> 18:15.638
to get it right the first time?

18:15.680 --> 18:17.098
Because I don't want
to give a lot of notes.

18:17.139 --> 18:18.724
And then it came to me.

18:18.766 --> 18:21.435
Who knows my father better
than Warden Gentles?

18:21.477 --> 18:24.814
Hold on one second.

18:24.856 --> 18:26.816
"The first time."

18:26.858 --> 18:27.942
Yeah.

18:27.984 --> 18:28.984
My grandson gave me this,

18:28.985 --> 18:30.862
but I guarantee you,
give me an old Royal

18:30.903 --> 18:32.488
and a glass of Scotch,
and I'll give you

18:32.530 --> 18:35.741
250 pages where
the lightning hits the tree.

18:35.783 --> 18:37.702
- That's not what we do here.
- I mean,

18:37.743 --> 18:38.911
where the drop hits the pond.

18:38.953 --> 18:40.413
- That's it.
- I apologize.

18:40.454 --> 18:41.664
I've had a few meetings today.

18:41.706 --> 18:42.665
Then...

18:42.707 --> 18:44.041
the yellow robot gets mad

18:44.083 --> 18:45.459
at the pink robot--

18:45.501 --> 18:47.044
- That does...
- correction...

18:47.086 --> 18:48.588
the purple robot.

18:48.629 --> 18:51.465
Sorry, I'm,
I'm back to back today.

18:51.507 --> 18:52.550
I bet.

18:52.592 --> 18:53.676
I'm gonna be honest with you.

18:53.718 --> 18:54.844
You're not charring my tree,

18:54.886 --> 18:57.388
and... yeah,

18:57.430 --> 18:59.350
Jerry's not gonna come
off the boat for this one.

18:59.390 --> 19:00.892
This is basically
a story about

19:00.933 --> 19:02.810
- Mm-hmm.
- a fellow like myself

19:02.852 --> 19:04.061
- and his father
- Mm-hmm.

19:04.103 --> 19:05.521
and their friend Carl Weathers.

19:05.563 --> 19:07.148
I'm not entirely sure

19:07.189 --> 19:10.610
how to organically work him
into the, to the story.

19:10.651 --> 19:11.861
Uh, you know,
maybe he's teaching them

19:11.903 --> 19:13.696
lessons or something.

19:13.738 --> 19:16.032
Anyway, I'm gonna leave that
up to your capable hands.

19:16.073 --> 19:18.868
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait a minute.

19:18.910 --> 19:19.994
I've turned it off again.

19:20.036 --> 19:21.996
Yeah, those are tricky.

19:22.038 --> 19:23.414
Might I suggest

19:23.456 --> 19:25.499
bringing in someone younger
to play the father--

19:25.541 --> 19:27.168
a Philip Seymour Hoffman type?

19:27.209 --> 19:29.128
A Philip Seymour Hoffman type.

19:29.170 --> 19:30.129
And so, naturally,

19:30.171 --> 19:31.505
I-I thought of you.

19:31.547 --> 19:33.132
Well, you know,
I'm a married man,

19:33.174 --> 19:34.759
so I don't really
keep a directory

19:34.800 --> 19:36.636
of attractive young
actresses around.

19:36.677 --> 19:38.596
- Okay.
- I mean, are you really planning

19:38.638 --> 19:41.432
on using her, or is it like
Conan with the girl writers?

19:41.474 --> 19:42.808
It doesn't matter, it...

19:42.850 --> 19:44.477
I-I'm here to talk
to you about a movie

19:44.518 --> 19:45.853
that we're gonna make
about the family,

19:45.895 --> 19:47.146
and I thought
that it might be really fun

19:47.188 --> 19:48.731
for us to work together again.

19:48.773 --> 19:50.983
Help me remember.
What did we do together?

19:51.025 --> 19:53.486
You came over for a chicken
and ham-water dinner

19:53.527 --> 19:55.567
that my family threw to raise
some funds for itself.

19:55.571 --> 19:57.031
And they're finally
getting around

19:57.073 --> 19:58.741
to making a movie of that, huh?

19:58.783 --> 20:00.034
There's more to it than that.

20:00.076 --> 20:01.577
It's, it's about
a young man trying

20:01.619 --> 20:04.080
to get out from under
his domineering father

20:04.121 --> 20:05.922
while dealing
with the slow death of his wife.

20:05.957 --> 20:07.667
That just saved me 12 bucks.

20:07.708 --> 20:09.794
I'm not going to see it.

20:09.835 --> 20:11.754
I'm not asking you to see it;
I'd like for you to be in it.

20:11.796 --> 20:14.131
No offense, I have a job.
I mean, I have a good thing.

20:14.173 --> 20:15.591
- Oh, hey, Mr. O'Brien.
- Hey, how's it going?

20:15.633 --> 20:17.510
- Real good.
- Andy, quick note.

20:17.551 --> 20:20.012
Uh, just 'cause I look at you
when we're doing the show

20:20.054 --> 20:22.264
and ask you a question doesn't
mean you have to respond.

20:22.306 --> 20:24.183
Sometimes it's funny
when you don't say anything,

20:24.225 --> 20:26.644
and the audience gets
to think, "Hey,

20:26.686 --> 20:28.145
Andy really is stupid."

20:29.313 --> 20:30.982
Gets a big laugh.

20:31.023 --> 20:32.817
- Hey, you're new.
- I've been here a year.

20:32.858 --> 20:34.986
And you're funny, too.

20:35.027 --> 20:36.278
Let's get you set up
in a writer's office.

20:36.320 --> 20:38.155
Oh, you can have Andy's
if you don't mind

20:38.197 --> 20:39.949
the smell of bologna.

20:39.991 --> 20:41.784
I'm in.

20:41.826 --> 20:45.329
♪ You're simply the best... ♪

20:45.371 --> 20:48.082
Michael had assembled
his dream team,

20:48.124 --> 20:50.793
and now it was time
to wow his boss.

20:50.835 --> 20:52.396
Excuse me, sir,
could you turn that off,

20:52.420 --> 20:53.379
please?

20:53.421 --> 20:55.840
Oh, I thought
that was playing in here.

20:55.881 --> 20:58.300
Sorry, it was a slide show
of my granddaughter's--

20:58.342 --> 21:00.177
daughter's graduation
from college.

21:00.219 --> 21:01.554
- Sure. - Michael.
- High school.

21:01.595 --> 21:03.597
- Hi.
- Did you get the signatures?

21:03.639 --> 21:06.142
Better-- I put together
the core team: acting

21:06.183 --> 21:08.060
- and writing.
- You guys do remember

21:08.102 --> 21:10.730
I have to be back in Burbank
by 1:00 every day, right?

21:10.771 --> 21:12.148
- We've got that, uh-huh.
- I'm looking forward to this.

21:12.189 --> 21:13.941
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- This is happening.

21:13.983 --> 21:15.735
- It is happening.
- It's happening.

21:15.776 --> 21:16.777
Dude, you are moving
way too fast.

21:16.819 --> 21:18.029
Maybe by Hollywood standards,

21:18.070 --> 21:20.322
you know, but, Kitty, I come
from the business community,

21:20.364 --> 21:23.367
where sometimes you have to
show it to him already built.

21:23.409 --> 21:25.244
Still think
you're going to bury me?

21:25.286 --> 21:28.372
Well, Michael, you may not
have your father's signature,

21:28.414 --> 21:30.916
but you sure have
his signature style.

21:30.958 --> 21:32.293
Cue the music.

21:33.711 --> 21:36.172
I think I just deleted my pitch.

21:36.213 --> 21:38.299
As it turns out,
it wouldn't matter.

21:40.384 --> 21:42.178
Uh-oh.

21:42.219 --> 21:44.346
Hello, think there's a problem
with the elevator.

21:44.388 --> 21:45.890
Do you have
a scheduled appointment?

21:45.931 --> 21:47.292
N-No, we're here
to see Ron Howard.

21:47.308 --> 21:49.351
This is the untitled
Michael B. project.

21:49.393 --> 21:51.145
I'm actually a producer here.
How are you?

21:51.187 --> 21:52.354
I've got the office
just below the sunken

21:52.396 --> 21:53.773
living room there in Brian's.

21:53.814 --> 21:55.274
We're here to pitch
Ron the movie.

21:55.316 --> 21:56.817
I'm sorry, sir, this is
a restricted floor.

21:56.859 --> 21:58.360
Louisa, it's all right.

21:58.402 --> 22:00.780
For crying out loud,
I'm not the king of England.

22:00.821 --> 22:02.948
- Ah, there he is, hey, Ron.
- Oh, did you get that signature?

22:02.990 --> 22:04.742
You know, I've got
something better--

22:04.784 --> 22:06.077
take a look.

22:06.118 --> 22:07.828
Andy Richter?

22:07.870 --> 22:09.955
I'm out,  it, I'm out.

22:09.997 --> 22:11.665
Not married to Andy,

22:11.707 --> 22:14.043
- but what I do have is the writer.
- Stephan Gentles,

22:14.085 --> 22:16.295
Warden, East Orange County
Department of Corrections

22:16.337 --> 22:20.216
and writer of multiple episodes
of Rocko's Modern Life.

22:20.257 --> 22:21.884
Well, everybody's got
to start somewhere.

22:21.926 --> 22:24.762
As long as I don't end up there.

22:24.804 --> 22:27.264
I'll have 25 pages on your desk
by tomorrow morning.

22:27.306 --> 22:28.891
Gosh, that's

22:28.933 --> 22:30.309
- putting the cart before the horse.
- Oh, yeah.

22:30.351 --> 22:32.812
Loo-Look who I've got
to play Carl Weathers.

22:32.853 --> 22:33.896
Oh, is that Cuba?

22:33.938 --> 22:35.314
No, no, n-n-no,
that's not Cuba.

22:35.356 --> 22:37.983
I did not want to
waste Cuba on Carl.

22:38.025 --> 22:39.276
This is Carl Weathers.

22:39.318 --> 22:41.195
Oh, sure, Carl.

22:41.237 --> 22:43.030
You know, I thought it was Cuba

22:43.072 --> 22:44.824
with the perfect
Carl Weathers makeup.

22:44.865 --> 22:47.993
No, no, no, no, Cuba doesn't
have that kind of range.

22:48.035 --> 22:49.411
The thing is,
I really do insist

22:49.453 --> 22:51.705
- on controlling the casting myself.
- I get it. - I'm out.

22:51.747 --> 22:53.948
I thought maybe if you just saw
the whole team together.

22:53.958 --> 22:55.417
Team, what team?

22:55.459 --> 22:56.961
I should be informed
of all meetings.

22:57.002 --> 22:58.337
Hey, Cuba, how you doing?

22:58.379 --> 23:00.381
Oh, Brian, you know Carl
Weathers, Stephan Gentles,

23:00.422 --> 23:02.174
Andy Richter,
and Michael Booth.

23:06.720 --> 23:08.848
I'm gonna skip this one.

23:08.889 --> 23:10.307
Good to see you, Brian.

23:10.349 --> 23:12.393
You know, Ron, I think
it might be easier to talk

23:12.434 --> 23:14.228
if we just come up
just the rest of the way.

23:14.270 --> 23:15.479
Oh, thanks.

23:15.521 --> 23:18.315
Yeah, the elevator's been kooky
since we lowered that floor...

23:18.357 --> 23:20.151
but maybe
once you get that signature.

23:20.192 --> 23:21.735
It might be kind of tricky.

23:21.777 --> 23:23.112
They're all down
in Orange County.

23:23.154 --> 23:25.072
- Tough to get down there.
- Oh, hey, B.

23:25.114 --> 23:26.740
- Yeah. - We must have an office
down there somewhere.

23:26.782 --> 23:27.783
Yeah, we'll stick you someplace.

23:27.825 --> 23:28.868
Yeah.

23:28.909 --> 23:30.035
We'll stick you someplace.

23:34.707 --> 23:36.500
Michael was starting work

23:36.542 --> 23:38.668
at his new show business office

23:38.711 --> 23:41.088
- at Orange County Imagine.
- Charles Dawkins.

23:41.130 --> 23:44.091
And his office was already
receiving a lot of visitors.

23:44.133 --> 23:46.427
Don't get comfortable.
Sir, thank you, no.

23:46.468 --> 23:47.761
But mostly because
of the sign's similarity

23:47.803 --> 23:49.471
to that of this institution,

23:49.513 --> 23:51.932
which also received
some confused visitors.

23:51.974 --> 23:53.392
An embolism?

23:53.434 --> 23:54.852
I-I was just here
to pitch a game show.

23:54.894 --> 23:57.271
Go right out this way,
sir, thank you.

23:57.313 --> 23:58.439
- But can I leave a sample?
- It's generous

23:58.480 --> 24:00.482
of you, but they're gonna be
much better

24:00.524 --> 24:02.735
with it down there at Imaging.

24:02.776 --> 24:05.057
And that's when Michael got
his most unexpected visitor.

24:08.574 --> 24:10.826
Dad, what are you doing here?

24:10.868 --> 24:14.788
I wanted to speak
to you in person.

24:14.830 --> 24:16.790
I think that you're
a little late, okay?

24:16.832 --> 24:20.419
Because I went to you
for a simple signature,

24:20.461 --> 24:23.088
not so I could just make
a movie about the family,

24:23.130 --> 24:24.757
but so that I can move on
with my life,

24:24.798 --> 24:26.675
and you told me to go to hell.

24:26.716 --> 24:28.594
Yeah, you know, sometimes,
when I'm caught off guard,

24:28.636 --> 24:30.930
I say things I don't mean.

24:30.971 --> 24:32.640
This is a horrible
little office.

24:32.681 --> 24:34.361
So you're here to apologize,
is that right?

24:34.391 --> 24:37.353
Yes, and I, uh, brought
you a peace offering.

24:37.394 --> 24:39.521
Tetas Gigantes?

24:39.563 --> 24:40.689
You hate it, right?

24:40.730 --> 24:42.149
Well, it's, it's Mexican porn.

24:42.191 --> 24:44.693
You know, you are
impossible to buy for.

24:44.734 --> 24:45.945
Just, uh, give it to me.

24:45.986 --> 24:47.029
- No, no, oh.
- No, no, no, give...

24:47.071 --> 24:48.906
- No, no, no.
- See, this is the  kayak

24:48.948 --> 24:50.616
- all over again.
- Dad, I apologize.

24:50.658 --> 24:52.576
I was saying it was
a very original gift.

24:52.618 --> 24:53.743
No, no, no.
You'll never use it.

24:53.786 --> 24:56.746
I will use it, except
for maybe Señor Señoritas.

24:56.789 --> 24:58.624
I live in Mexico now

24:58.666 --> 25:00.834
and I, I don't always
know how to ask

25:00.876 --> 25:02.461
- exactly for what I want.
- Understandable.

25:02.503 --> 25:04.088
And that's almost over now,

25:04.129 --> 25:08.008
which is what I came
to talk to you about.

25:08.050 --> 25:09.635
Do you know a guy
named Herbert Love?

25:09.677 --> 25:10.886
I know a lot of people, sure,

25:10.928 --> 25:12.762
'cause I'm a big producer now.

25:12.805 --> 25:14.390
- Yeah?
- He ate a mouse.

25:14.431 --> 25:16.809
Let's grab a coffee.

25:16.850 --> 25:18.560
Okay, so I guess things
haven't been going

25:18.602 --> 25:20.020
that well for me.

25:20.062 --> 25:22.481
And you didn't feel
you could tell me that?

25:22.523 --> 25:23.773
That's why I haven't
heard from you?

25:23.816 --> 25:25.693
I guess I was afraid
that if I admitted

25:25.734 --> 25:27.069
Sudden Valley was a failure...

25:27.111 --> 25:29.738
- Told you so.
- ...you might say, "I told you so."

25:29.779 --> 25:32.992
Well, then, you don't
know me at all.

25:33.033 --> 25:34.910
It's all right, it's my fault. I
bit off more than I could chew.

25:34.952 --> 25:36.662
I mean, I lied
about being a big shot

25:36.704 --> 25:39.832
to impress this girl
whose name I don't even know.

25:39.873 --> 25:42.960
I've got this crazy idea
that I'm gonna turn into a star

25:43.002 --> 25:45.587
with a film that I can't
get made 'cause I can't get

25:45.629 --> 25:47.006
my own father's signature
on, on, on a release.

25:47.047 --> 25:48.674
- It's like, you know...
- Shh, shh, shh...

25:48.716 --> 25:53.053
I didn't know it was
about lying to a girl.

25:53.095 --> 25:56.056
Give me the release.

25:56.098 --> 25:57.474
You'd do this for me?

25:57.516 --> 25:59.476
Of course I will.

25:59.518 --> 26:01.478
And so, with his
father's rights in hand,

26:01.520 --> 26:03.522
Michael the producer headed up

26:03.564 --> 26:05.983
to find his lady
"Cinderella Man"

26:06.025 --> 26:07.609
at the Ealing Club,

26:07.651 --> 26:09.445
an exclusive show business
hangout.

26:09.486 --> 26:10.612
Ron Howard.

26:10.654 --> 26:12.156
Oh, thank you.

26:12.197 --> 26:14.742
No, it's Michael Bluth. Hi.

26:14.783 --> 26:16.160
Oh, I remember.

26:16.201 --> 26:17.911
I did it.

26:17.953 --> 26:18.954
I got my father's signature.

26:18.996 --> 26:20.581
You know, you said
you wanted to focus

26:20.622 --> 26:21.915
on the father-son relationship,
and I love it.

26:21.957 --> 26:23.625
Who's not going to
be able to relate

26:23.667 --> 26:24.918
to a son standing up to
his self-centered father?

26:24.960 --> 26:26.503
Sure.

26:26.545 --> 26:28.005
But the father-son relationship
I was interested in

26:28.047 --> 26:31.841
was not you and your father,
it was you and your son.

26:31.884 --> 26:34.011
You're the father.

26:34.053 --> 26:36.846
But that would make
my son the son.

26:36.889 --> 26:38.098
Bingo.

26:38.140 --> 26:39.808
Michael had to decide

26:39.849 --> 26:41.977
whether being a producer
was worth invading

26:42.019 --> 26:46.190
the privacy of a son who had
kicked him out for that reason.

26:46.231 --> 26:47.733
I don't think I can do it.
I don't think I can go...

26:47.775 --> 26:49.485
I can't go to my son.

26:49.526 --> 26:51.861
That's, uh-- I just--
I don't even think

26:51.904 --> 26:54.114
that it's worth it just to say
that I'm a producer, like...

26:54.156 --> 26:55.491
- It's your call.
- Yeah.

26:55.532 --> 26:59.453
Maybe the real estate business
will come around soon.

26:59.495 --> 27:01.580
Will it?

27:01.622 --> 27:05.459
I could never reveal that
information to a non-producer.

27:05.501 --> 27:06.710
And then he heard something

27:06.752 --> 27:08.878
that made him change his mind.

27:08.921 --> 27:10.255
Michael?

27:10.297 --> 27:12.674
Mr. Moobie Producer.

27:12.716 --> 27:13.926
That's me.

27:16.178 --> 27:19.598
And like all bagpipe music,

27:19.640 --> 27:22.017
it was hard to tell if it was
good music played horribly

27:22.059 --> 27:24.853
or horrible music played well,

27:24.894 --> 27:26.563
but Michael was eager
to find out

27:26.605 --> 27:28.774
her name
when she was introduced

27:28.816 --> 27:30.609
at the end of the set.

27:31.819 --> 27:33.070
And tonight on bagpipes...

27:38.075 --> 27:40.285
But he got to know her anyway.

27:40.327 --> 27:42.246
Fantastic.

27:42.287 --> 27:44.039
I'm only doing this
in between movies,

27:44.081 --> 27:46.792
which, given how badly I bombed
at that audition yesterday,

27:46.834 --> 27:48.544
it's going to be a while.

27:48.585 --> 27:49.919
Yeah, you shouldn't worry
about that, you're gonna get

27:49.962 --> 27:51.547
something.
You know, sometimes

27:51.588 --> 27:53.257
even students make films.

27:54.800 --> 27:56.510
Yeah, that's really funny.

27:56.552 --> 27:58.554
I just could put
your name in for something.

27:58.595 --> 27:59.680
I do know Ron Howard.

28:02.015 --> 28:03.725
Love that I make you laugh.

28:03.767 --> 28:05.894
You seriously would be
great for this part.

28:05.935 --> 28:07.771
You remind me of the person
that, that it's based on.

28:07.813 --> 28:10.190
Uh, she, she actually
dies on camera.

28:10.232 --> 28:11.191
Wow.

28:11.233 --> 28:12.776
Make her mentally challenged

28:12.818 --> 28:14.111
and I'll thank you
in my Oscar speech.

28:14.153 --> 28:15.320
There's a part like that, too,

28:15.362 --> 28:17.281
only she-she comes in later

28:17.322 --> 28:20.159
and she's British,
so she doesn't seem...

28:20.200 --> 28:21.994
No one could ever tell
that she's disabled.

28:22.035 --> 28:23.996
I haven't been in work mode
for a while to be honest.

28:24.037 --> 28:26.665
I've been, I've been
raising my son.

28:26.707 --> 28:28.041
Oh, you have a son?
I have a son.

28:28.083 --> 28:29.710
- You do?
- Oh, yeah, we've got a little issue,

28:29.751 --> 28:30.711
though, right now.

28:30.752 --> 28:31.879
Let me guess.

28:31.920 --> 28:33.255
He's pushing you away?

28:33.297 --> 28:35.215
- Yes.
- My son practically

28:35.257 --> 28:37.259
kicked me out of his school
the other day.

28:37.301 --> 28:39.761
That is literally
what my son did to me.

28:39.803 --> 28:41.221
Then I said to him,

28:41.263 --> 28:42.973
"You have no privacy from me."

28:43.015 --> 28:44.683
That's what I should do.

28:44.725 --> 28:45.976
Lem's six in August.

28:46.018 --> 28:46.977
Yours?

28:47.019 --> 28:48.854
- Seven in July.
- Aw...

28:48.896 --> 28:50.147
Michael regretted the lie,

28:50.189 --> 28:52.149
so he sort of split
the difference.

28:52.191 --> 28:54.693
Teen-- 17

28:54.735 --> 28:55.903
- in July.
- Oh.

28:55.944 --> 28:57.279
They grow up so fast,
don't they?

28:57.321 --> 28:59.656
Oh, wow.

28:59.698 --> 29:02.284
Well, I guess you got to move
on with your life sometime.

29:03.327 --> 29:05.704
Yes.

29:05.746 --> 29:09.082
Yes, you do.

29:09.124 --> 29:11.084
Oh, n-no, you know what?

29:11.126 --> 29:14.004
I don't think that this
is-- it's not a good idea.

29:14.046 --> 29:15.797
This is a great idea.
Why don't you think this is

29:15.839 --> 29:17.341
- a great idea?
- 'Cause people can see.

29:17.382 --> 29:19.218
- Nobody can see.
- Oh, God.

29:19.259 --> 29:21.220
Wow, you weren't kidding

29:21.261 --> 29:23.639
when you said you had
a part for me.

29:23.680 --> 29:25.224
- That was absolutely insane.
- Thanks.

29:25.265 --> 29:27.601
I've never done anything
that crazy before.

29:27.643 --> 29:28.769
- Perfect.
- I want to do a lot more of that.

29:28.810 --> 29:29.895
I want to see you again.

29:29.937 --> 29:31.730
I want to take you out
to a nice dinner.

29:31.772 --> 29:33.065
- Oh.
- So, then, uh...

29:33.106 --> 29:35.984
Well, this will have
to tide you over until then.

29:36.026 --> 29:37.778
Oh, look at those.

29:37.819 --> 29:39.154
Boy, without this, I wouldn't
know you had a tattoo.

29:39.196 --> 29:40.405
Oh, anyone that gets
that much clothing

29:40.447 --> 29:42.324
off me better know my name.

29:43.408 --> 29:45.744
- Good night.
- Good night.

29:46.954 --> 29:50.791
And that's when
Michael finally saw her name.

29:50.832 --> 29:52.376
Oh, my God.

29:54.795 --> 29:56.755
I'm dating
Ron Howard's girlfriend.

29:56.797 --> 29:58.924
Actually she's his daughter.

29:58.966 --> 30:02.469
But that's kind of worse,
don't you think?

30:06.431 --> 30:08.267
Michael starts
to really learn the business.

30:08.308 --> 30:09.977
We can keep going around
another 20 minutes, if you want,

30:10.018 --> 30:11.353
but I know what
I'm talking about.

30:11.395 --> 30:13.981
I just went through this
last week with a guy.

30:14.022 --> 30:15.857
That is a hernia.

30:15.899 --> 30:17.442
I'm gonna send you to my guy
over at Hoag Hospital.

30:17.484 --> 30:18.860
They call him the
Bulge Whisperer.

30:18.902 --> 30:21.238
He does 20 of these a week.

30:21.280 --> 30:23.282
And after failing to
get back to Burbank on time,

30:23.323 --> 30:25.117
Andy calls in a favor

30:25.158 --> 30:26.743
from his identical
quintuplet brother Rocky.

30:26.785 --> 30:28.787
All right, my next guest
is a famous pilot

30:28.829 --> 30:32.207
who safely crashed his plane
into the Hudson River.

30:32.249 --> 30:33.792
That's kind of a
coincidence, Andy.

30:33.834 --> 30:36.295
We've got a pilot
who crashes planes,

30:36.336 --> 30:39.298
and you're an actor
who crashes pilots.

30:39.339 --> 30:42.217
And Rocky hurts two nice
red-haired guys' feelings...

30:42.259 --> 30:44.011
Yeah, that's really funny.

30:44.052 --> 30:45.846
You know what else
would be funny?

30:45.887 --> 30:47.764
If I ripped that red rug
right off your head

30:47.806 --> 30:50.392
and turned you into Ron Howard.

30:50.434 --> 30:53.802
...while getting the biggest
laugh of Andy's career.

30:54.267 --> 31:03.891
