WEBVTT

00:01.172 --> 00:03.010
Previously on...

00:03.034 --> 00:05.312
Well, if Libby here likes us
as much as we like her,

00:05.336 --> 00:07.414
we should just go ahead and move to
adopt her baby girl. Who's the father?

00:07.438 --> 00:08.485
Honestly, I don't know.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.517
Carlos and Gaby made a deal...

00:10.541 --> 00:13.060
I did remarry my ex,
but it was only because

00:13.084 --> 00:15.267
he has great health insurance.
Susan made amends...

00:15.291 --> 00:17.764
You know, I never thought
I'd have such a good time

00:17.788 --> 00:20.027
hanging out with my girlfriend
and her husband.

00:20.051 --> 00:22.429
And Mike...
Didn't she mention we dated?

00:22.453 --> 00:25.037
Made a confession... Liar!
You've just been leading me on!

00:25.061 --> 00:27.534
You're obviously still in love
with this guy!

00:27.558 --> 00:29.058
Of his own.

00:30.261 --> 00:32.238
On her first day of sobriety,

00:32.262 --> 00:34.350
Bree Van De Kamp
found an old cork,

00:34.374 --> 00:39.486
which reminded her just
how much she craved chablis.

00:39.510 --> 00:43.120
So she called her sponsor,
who came over with a DVD

00:43.144 --> 00:47.554
which they watched
till her craving had passed.

00:47.578 --> 00:51.328
Five days later, after she
developed a thirst for Merlot,

00:51.352 --> 00:54.030
Peter arrived
with a deck of cards.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.541
The next week,
he brought over Chinese takeout

00:56.565 --> 00:58.535
because Bree had told him

00:58.559 --> 01:03.210
she was consumed by thoughts
of vintage chardonnay.

01:03.234 --> 01:07.214
By her 20th day of sobriety,
Bree had stopped thinking

01:07.238 --> 01:08.715
about alcohol altogether

01:08.739 --> 01:13.620
because her thoughts
were now centered elsewhere.

01:13.644 --> 01:15.552
Hmm...

01:15.576 --> 01:18.155
Yeah, huh.

01:18.179 --> 01:19.656
I'm curious, Peter.

01:19.680 --> 01:22.129
What is the easiest way
to overcome addiction?

01:22.153 --> 01:24.731
Oh, some folks
try shock therapy.

01:24.755 --> 01:26.733
Other use, uh, hypnosis.

01:26.757 --> 01:28.735
But taking it one day at a time

01:28.759 --> 01:30.737
still makes
the most sense to me.

01:30.761 --> 01:31.738
Why?

01:31.762 --> 01:33.240
I don't know.

01:33.264 --> 01:36.134
I guess I'm just impatient
to get on with my life.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.178
What are you doing?

01:41.202 --> 01:44.111
I was just
giving you a little kiss.

01:44.135 --> 01:45.782
Why?

01:45.806 --> 01:48.285
Well, it's just my way
of saying thank you

01:48.309 --> 01:52.088
for everything you've done
for me over the past few weeks.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.691
What's... wrong?

01:54.715 --> 01:57.694
This is gonna seem like
it's coming out of left field,

01:57.718 --> 02:00.267
but in addition to being
a recovering alcoholic,

02:00.291 --> 02:02.521
I'm also a member of s.A.

02:04.355 --> 02:06.203
Sex addicts anonymous.

02:09.229 --> 02:12.679
Oh. And that's a...
A real thing?

02:12.703 --> 02:16.112
Yes. Sex is as much
an addiction for me as booze.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.385
That's why when
you turn me on like that,

02:18.409 --> 02:22.289
it's a bit of a problem. It
was just a peck on the cheek.

02:22.313 --> 02:23.590
It doesn't matter.

02:23.614 --> 02:25.731
The slightest touch
gets my juices flowing.

02:25.755 --> 02:29.396
So... how long
has it been since you...

02:29.420 --> 02:31.758
A year.

02:31.782 --> 02:34.206
They have this rule...
Plant, pet, person.

02:34.230 --> 02:36.503
If I can keep
a plant alive, you know,

02:36.527 --> 02:38.505
then I can move on to a pet.

02:38.529 --> 02:41.438
And if I can make that work,
then I can start dating again.

02:41.462 --> 02:43.770
So how are you doing?

02:43.794 --> 02:45.612
I'm on my fourth ficus.

02:45.636 --> 02:47.244
Oh.

02:55.846 --> 02:57.584
See?

02:57.608 --> 02:59.586
I think you can handle affection

02:59.610 --> 03:01.680
better than
you give yourself credit for.

03:07.288 --> 03:08.835
Oh! Oh!

03:14.425 --> 03:15.402
Oh!

03:15.426 --> 03:17.344
Oh, oh!

03:17.368 --> 03:18.445
I'm sorry.

03:18.469 --> 03:20.447
Um... I think I should go.

03:20.471 --> 03:21.778
Really? Yeah.

03:21.802 --> 03:25.512
Peter! But... but...
You forgot your shirt!

03:25.536 --> 03:27.306
Keep it.

03:29.280 --> 03:31.258
Though she didn't know it,

03:31.282 --> 03:33.590
Bree had answered
her own question.

03:33.614 --> 03:38.265
The easiest way
to overcome one addiction...

03:38.289 --> 03:46.289
Is to replace it with another.

03:48.829 --> 03:50.437
Temptation...

03:50.461 --> 03:52.809
It's the name
of a well-known establishment

03:52.833 --> 03:55.282
on the outskirts of Fairview.

03:55.306 --> 03:58.445
Its clientele is devoted.

03:58.469 --> 04:00.987
Everyone who goes there

04:01.011 --> 04:04.251
wants to get their hands
on something.

04:04.275 --> 04:06.793
And when they cross a line...

04:06.817 --> 04:08.525
Hey! I warned you, pal.

04:08.549 --> 04:11.298
They are punished...

04:11.322 --> 04:14.309
As a certain married couple
were about to discover.

04:14.333 --> 04:16.803
Hi.

04:16.827 --> 04:18.305
You want a lap dance?

04:18.329 --> 04:21.668
Uh...

04:21.692 --> 04:23.832
No, thanks. No.

04:26.467 --> 04:29.676
I sure hope
Libby likes this camera.

04:29.700 --> 04:32.349
Well, why wouldn't she?
It's exactly what she asked for,

04:32.373 --> 04:34.356
the most expensive one
in the store.

04:34.380 --> 04:36.353
You know,
I'm telling you, Carlos.

04:36.377 --> 04:38.355
I'm getting really tired
of kissing her ass.

04:38.379 --> 04:40.357
The woman is giving us her baby.

04:40.381 --> 04:42.529
We'll kiss
whatever needs kissing.

04:42.553 --> 04:44.836
What the hell
are you guys doing here?

04:44.860 --> 04:46.833
Uh, we brought you this gift,

04:46.857 --> 04:50.467
and you said that you didn't
want us coming by your house...

04:50.491 --> 04:52.499
Thanks, but I'm working,
so you gotta go.

04:52.523 --> 04:54.506
Look, we spent
a lot of money on that.

04:54.530 --> 04:56.503
The least you can do is open it

04:56.527 --> 04:59.275
so we can bask
in your happy expression.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.647
Is there a problem here?

05:00.671 --> 05:02.879
No, we're just talking.
It's... everything's fine.

05:02.903 --> 05:05.286
Carlos solis.
This is my wife, Gabrielle.

05:05.310 --> 05:06.583
We're friends of Libby's.

05:06.607 --> 05:09.916
Oh, hey, I'm frank,
Libby's boyfriend.

05:09.940 --> 05:11.358
Huh.

05:11.382 --> 05:13.790
Libby, you didn't tell us
you had a boyfriend.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.892
Didn't I? I thought I had.

05:15.916 --> 05:18.586
What's that,
a present for our baby?

05:20.451 --> 05:23.330
I'm sorry,
did you just say "our" baby?

05:23.354 --> 05:27.504
Yeah. It's our first.

05:28.999 --> 05:31.307
Hey!

05:31.331 --> 05:32.609
What's for lunch?

05:32.633 --> 05:34.716
Omelettes. You want me
to make you one?

05:34.740 --> 05:36.643
No, thank you.
I'll just pick at yours.

05:36.667 --> 05:39.085
I didn't know
you still had a key, dad.

05:39.109 --> 05:40.587
Of course I do.

05:40.611 --> 05:42.449
I have to watch out
for my two favorite ladies.

05:42.473 --> 05:45.326
Try the cheese. That's
the best part. Mmm.

05:45.350 --> 05:48.024
You mean, two of your three
favorite ladies.

05:48.048 --> 05:50.797
You know, when you add in Edie.

05:50.821 --> 05:52.699
Right! Of course.

05:52.723 --> 05:55.962
And speaking of Edie,
I have some big news.

05:55.986 --> 05:58.765
I finally did it.
I popped the question.

05:58.789 --> 06:00.707
Oh! Congratulations, dad!

06:00.731 --> 06:02.469
Yeah... congratulations.

06:02.493 --> 06:05.772
Um, what happened
to waiting six months?

06:05.796 --> 06:08.375
Edie and I aren't
getting married tomorrow.

06:08.399 --> 06:12.449
It takes months to plan
a classy wedding, you know?

06:12.473 --> 06:15.590
Remember ours, hmm? You had
to have it outdoors, huh?

06:15.614 --> 06:18.024
Ugh. It poured.

06:18.048 --> 06:19.726
I could have murdered
that weatherman.

06:19.750 --> 06:23.029
We were all crammed
under this little gazebo thingy.

06:23.053 --> 06:25.031
It was hysterical.

06:25.055 --> 06:27.434
I thought the whole wedding day
was ruined.

06:27.458 --> 06:29.466
I loved it! It felt spontaneous.

06:29.490 --> 06:34.140
All our friends
gathered close around us, hmm?

06:34.164 --> 06:36.743
Remember?

06:36.767 --> 06:40.567
You said it was the happiest day
of your life.

06:44.635 --> 06:46.613
Just like you marrying Edie

06:46.637 --> 06:49.085
will be the happiest day
ofherlife.

06:49.109 --> 06:51.418
Yeah. Right.

06:51.442 --> 06:53.660
Her, too.

06:53.684 --> 06:55.524
Toodles.

07:00.150 --> 07:01.868
Oh, hi.

07:01.892 --> 07:03.129
Hello.

07:03.153 --> 07:06.510
Andrew said it was all right
for me to get a cream soda.

07:06.534 --> 07:08.635
Uh, sure. Help yourself.

07:08.659 --> 07:10.837
There's also frosted glasses
in the freezer.

07:10.861 --> 07:13.039
Can is fine, but thank you.

07:13.063 --> 07:15.712
Oh, and, uh,
I left a list for you

07:15.736 --> 07:18.545
of the witnesses
we'll be deposing.

07:18.569 --> 07:20.709
It's, uh, there on the counter.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.530
Hi.

07:33.554 --> 07:34.554
Hey.

07:36.857 --> 07:39.866
I know that you're still angry
with me, and, um...

07:39.890 --> 07:45.441
I wanted to tell you
that I have, um...

07:45.465 --> 07:48.475
Joined a recovery program.

07:48.499 --> 07:50.517
A.a.

07:50.541 --> 07:53.620
I just
wanted you to know that...

07:53.644 --> 07:56.483
And to tell you I'm sorry.

07:56.507 --> 07:58.485
You are...

07:58.509 --> 08:00.809
A real friend,
and I value your honesty.

08:03.183 --> 08:05.461
Oh, I don't wanna
be mad anymore.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.463
And I'm so happy
to hear all that,

08:07.487 --> 08:10.136
and I am so proud of you.
Oh, thanks,

08:10.160 --> 08:12.138
but I'm not really
out of the woods yet.

08:12.162 --> 08:15.009
I still have this whole
court case hanging over my head.

08:15.033 --> 08:16.503
I heard about that.

08:16.527 --> 08:18.845
Andrew's asking
to be emancipated?

08:18.869 --> 08:20.847
Yes, and his lawyer
is taking depositions now

08:20.871 --> 08:23.209
to see if I am a fit parent.

08:23.233 --> 08:24.711
Oy.

08:24.735 --> 08:27.213
And considering that mishap
that I had with your kids,

08:27.237 --> 08:29.856
I, uh, I imagine
he'll be anxious to talk to you.

08:29.880 --> 08:31.888
Well, it makes sense, I guess.

08:31.912 --> 08:33.489
Yeah.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.823
Do you have any idea
what you might say?

08:38.087 --> 08:40.087
I, um...

08:43.594 --> 08:46.903
I'll focus
on your good qualities.

08:49.560 --> 08:51.808
I could not ask
for anything more.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.680
Thanks.

08:53.704 --> 08:56.212
See you around, I hope.
All right.

08:56.236 --> 08:59.916
That's... not why
you came to apologize, is it?

08:59.940 --> 09:01.688
What do you mean?

09:01.712 --> 09:04.791
To soften me up
for the deposition.

09:04.815 --> 09:07.215
Of course not.

09:10.751 --> 09:13.560
Um...

09:13.584 --> 09:16.933
I just want you
to understand something.

09:16.957 --> 09:19.606
Andrew is making accusations...

09:19.630 --> 09:22.609
False accusations,
saying that I abused him,

09:22.633 --> 09:25.720
all because I wouldn't let him
have his trust fund early

09:25.744 --> 09:27.714
so he could buy a car.

09:27.738 --> 09:30.717
I mean, can you blame me
for wanting to know

09:30.741 --> 09:33.079
if I have your support?

09:33.103 --> 09:34.921
And...

09:34.945 --> 09:37.183
So... what,

09:37.207 --> 09:40.107
you want me to lie?
Make you look good?

09:43.583 --> 09:46.100
I actually don't want
anything of the sort.

09:46.124 --> 09:48.965
Good.

09:48.989 --> 09:50.967
Because
when I give my deposition,

09:50.991 --> 09:53.061
I'm going to tell the truth.

10:10.080 --> 10:12.058
To what do I owe this pleasure?

10:12.082 --> 10:14.082
I want you to look at something.

10:20.851 --> 10:23.599
Myra holt
is talking to Paul young,

10:23.623 --> 10:26.707
chatting away with him as though
he were any other neighbor.

10:26.731 --> 10:28.705
Now I told her
he killed my sister.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.807
I mentioned it to her
six months ago when we were

10:30.831 --> 10:32.809
standing in the express line
at the market.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.820
But still, there she is,
yakking away.

10:34.844 --> 10:36.983
Oh, Mike.

10:37.007 --> 10:40.016
I'm afraid people's memories
aren't what they used to be.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.919
What do you want, Felicia?

10:42.943 --> 10:45.321
I wanna see
how goodyourmemory is,

10:45.345 --> 10:48.324
if you recall a certain promise
you made to me.

10:48.348 --> 10:51.758
I am not gonna kill him. Why
not? Give me one good reason.

10:51.782 --> 10:54.160
Because things have changed.

10:54.184 --> 10:56.167
How? My sister still lies
rotting in the ground.

10:56.191 --> 10:59.235
So does dierdre. No, I don't see
how anything's changed at all.

10:59.259 --> 11:01.407
You're just gonna
have to let this go.

11:01.431 --> 11:04.848
Sounds to me as though
someone's let go of his rage.

11:04.872 --> 11:07.814
Maybe I have.

11:07.838 --> 11:10.368
Well, ihaven't.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.761
And that bitch of a stripper
lied to us.

11:16.785 --> 11:19.255
The father's
totally in the dark.

11:19.279 --> 11:22.258
He clearly wants to keep the
baby. Mr. Solis, if the father wants

11:22.282 --> 11:24.766
to assert his rights here,
there's nothing we can do.

11:24.790 --> 11:26.693
I'll find you another baby.
I promise.

11:26.717 --> 11:29.696
I don't want another baby. I want
this one! Oh, honey, he's right, okay.

11:29.720 --> 11:32.338
That trashy girl has been
lying to us from the get-go.

11:32.362 --> 11:35.046
Let's just walk away
while we can. It's not worth it.

11:35.070 --> 11:37.774
Look, don't get cold feet now,
Gaby, please. All right?

11:37.798 --> 11:39.776
Let's just pay frank
the way we paid Libby

11:39.800 --> 11:42.678
and then bring the baby home. Wait,
wait, wait...

11:42.702 --> 11:44.210
You paid Libby?

11:44.234 --> 11:46.221
You said
we could give her gifts.

11:46.245 --> 11:48.314
Everybody loves getting cash.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.719
I could probably be disbarred
for even listening to this.

11:52.743 --> 11:54.290
I cannot condone baby-buying!

11:54.314 --> 11:57.293
And I sure as hell
can't be part of it.

11:57.317 --> 11:58.694
Oh, Mr. Beale, come on.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.466
No, no, hear me out.

12:00.490 --> 12:03.329
If you are determined
to go down this dark road,

12:03.353 --> 12:05.772
and unbeknownst to me
steal this...

12:05.796 --> 12:08.074
Paternal rights waiver
that's sitting on my desk,

12:08.098 --> 12:11.077
and have this frank guy sign
both sides and date the top,

12:11.101 --> 12:14.501
I can't be part of that, either.

12:16.967 --> 12:18.107
Hmm.

12:20.270 --> 12:23.890
Okay, i-I'm gonna go to dad's.

12:23.914 --> 12:25.927
Oh, wait! Why don't
you let me walk with you?

12:25.951 --> 12:27.794
Uh, shouldn't you be resting?

12:27.818 --> 12:29.095
No! I'm fine.

12:29.119 --> 12:31.798
The doctor said I should
actually keep my blood flowing.

12:31.822 --> 12:34.809
Well, do you have to do it while
we walk over to Edie's?

12:34.833 --> 12:38.434
I just... I don't wanna risk
you running into dad.

12:38.458 --> 12:39.936
Okay...

12:39.960 --> 12:41.938
You guys have
just been so chummy lately,

12:41.962 --> 12:45.116
and... this whole flirting thing
is kind of freaking me out.

12:45.140 --> 12:47.844
Wait a second,
we're... we're not flirting.

12:47.868 --> 12:50.346
Mom, you fed him eggs
with your fork.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.919
Okay, yes,

12:52.943 --> 12:55.860
I am closer to your father
than I have been in the past.

12:55.884 --> 12:59.926
The bitter hatred's now settled
into a respectful disgust.

12:59.950 --> 13:01.487
That's the kind of thing

13:01.511 --> 13:03.511
most children of divorce
dream about.

13:08.358 --> 13:10.466
Hey, Edie.
What's all this stuff for?

13:10.490 --> 13:13.199
Oh, hi! Don't tell anyone,

13:13.223 --> 13:15.280
but I'm planning
a huge surprise for Karl.

13:15.304 --> 13:16.772
A surprise?

13:16.796 --> 13:18.774
Yeah, I'm putting together
an engagement party

13:18.798 --> 13:19.775
tomorrow afternoon.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.047
Oh, cool.

13:21.071 --> 13:23.509
But that's not the surprise.

13:23.533 --> 13:26.343
Actually, it's gonna be
a surprise wedding.

13:29.079 --> 13:30.286
I know!

13:30.310 --> 13:33.189
My pilates teacher
got ordained over the Internet.

13:33.213 --> 13:36.027
The, uh, church of the divine
something or other.

13:36.051 --> 13:38.464
I'm not sure.
Anyway, it's all legal.

13:38.488 --> 13:40.466
And, well, just one more day

13:40.490 --> 13:43.890
before I make an honest man
out of your daddy.

13:47.127 --> 13:50.106
Oh! You're so sweet.

13:50.130 --> 13:54.210
Thank you so much
for your good wishes.

13:54.234 --> 13:57.844
Oh. No, Edie, wait.
Um, no, it's just that...

13:57.868 --> 13:58.985
You know, I was married to Karl,

13:59.009 --> 14:01.988
and I used to...
Try to surprise him,

14:02.012 --> 14:05.892
and he would always, always,
alwayssay...

14:05.916 --> 14:09.856
"No, Susan. Don't surprise me.
I don't like it."

14:09.880 --> 14:13.199
Whatever. I'm doing it,
so keep your trap shut.

14:13.223 --> 14:15.461
Now if you'll excuse me,

14:15.485 --> 14:18.564
I've gotta go and buy
a wedding dress.

14:18.588 --> 14:20.566
Oh, and by the way,
I'll be wearing white,

14:20.590 --> 14:24.170
so that'll be a surprise
for everybody.

14:29.369 --> 14:32.078
I don't know why
I have to get dragged into this.

14:32.102 --> 14:33.579
What happened with my kids

14:33.603 --> 14:36.260
has nothing to do with
Bree's situation with Andrew.

14:36.284 --> 14:37.523
Sit.

14:37.547 --> 14:39.455
Well, it's my understanding

14:39.479 --> 14:41.457
that real harm could have
come to your children

14:41.481 --> 14:44.190
as a direct result
of your friend's behavior.

14:44.214 --> 14:46.437
I'm sorry, Mr. Bormanis,
but I'm not gonna testify.

14:46.461 --> 14:48.434
It just
doesn't feel right to me.

14:48.458 --> 14:52.999
Well, this isn't the first time
someone's felt the way you do.

14:53.023 --> 14:56.973
So this isn't the first time
I've had to say that

14:56.997 --> 14:59.946
if you refuse to give
a deposition of your own accord,

14:59.970 --> 15:01.877
I'll compel you to give one.

15:05.275 --> 15:07.275
But I'm sure I won't have to.

15:16.546 --> 15:18.524
You're saying Bree did this?

15:18.548 --> 15:20.218
While under the influence.

15:22.452 --> 15:25.579
I understand your reluctance
to turn on a friend,

15:25.603 --> 15:28.104
but this isn't about you.

15:28.128 --> 15:30.106
It's about Andrew.

15:30.130 --> 15:32.930
Don't you think
he's suffered enough?

15:43.713 --> 15:45.696
How much are you gonna give him?

15:45.720 --> 15:47.693
I figured
we could start with forty.

15:47.717 --> 15:49.125
Thousand?

15:49.149 --> 15:52.528
He's a bouncer in a strip club.
Offer him eight.

15:52.552 --> 15:55.206
He's not going
to sell his baby for $8,000.

15:55.230 --> 15:57.363
Are we talking about
the same idiot?

15:57.387 --> 15:59.505
I think for $8,000,
you throw in a kidney.

15:59.529 --> 16:01.337
I'm not gonna blow this
by bargain hunting.

16:01.361 --> 16:03.339
You know,
that's your problem, Carlos.

16:03.363 --> 16:06.072
Remember when you bought
your car? You paid sticker.

16:06.096 --> 16:08.714
Nobody pays sticker! Okay, and
what's the sticker price on a child, huh?

16:08.738 --> 16:11.398
Tell me that.
I'm thinking $12,000.

16:13.673 --> 16:15.656
Frank,
you have to sign the paper.

16:15.680 --> 16:18.454
I made a deal with
these people. A deal?

16:18.478 --> 16:21.557
This isn't a used car we're
talking about. It's our baby.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.259
Before you screw this up,

16:23.283 --> 16:25.666
just remember that I can
go to the cops and tell them

16:25.690 --> 16:28.564
about the pot farm you have
going on in our basement.

16:30.420 --> 16:31.737
It's just a couple plants.

16:31.761 --> 16:34.700
Yeah, I don't do it for profits.

16:34.724 --> 16:36.442
Hobby, mostly.

16:36.466 --> 16:39.375
Oh, come on, frank. You know
you would be a lousy father.

16:39.399 --> 16:42.408
It's my kid! And I have a right
to mess her up if I want.

16:42.432 --> 16:45.486
And if you go near the police,
I'll tell 'em how

16:45.510 --> 16:48.654
you've been stealing
all those tips from Sheila.

16:48.678 --> 16:50.156
Okay, we're done.

16:50.180 --> 16:53.219
Gaby, Gaby, no, just... Hold on.

16:53.243 --> 16:56.567
Now maybe there's a way that
wecan work this out together.

16:56.591 --> 16:58.564
There is nothing to work out.

16:58.588 --> 17:01.197
If frank is not on board
with this, it's over.

17:01.221 --> 17:04.130
Wait! Uh...
It doesn't matter what he wants.

17:04.154 --> 17:06.071
Why not?

17:06.096 --> 17:07.726
Because it's not your baby.

17:09.398 --> 17:11.237
That's a lie.

17:11.261 --> 17:14.640
What if I took a paternity test?
Will that shut you up?

17:14.664 --> 17:16.721
Wait, if it's not frank's,
then whose is it?

17:16.744 --> 17:19.615
I'm not sure.

17:19.638 --> 17:21.117
All's I know is,

17:21.141 --> 17:24.119
I got pregnant right after
I worked at the calgary rodeo,

17:24.144 --> 17:27.593
and I was very popular there.

17:27.617 --> 17:30.226
So what are you saying,
you screwed a bunch of cowboys?

17:30.250 --> 17:33.659
You have your hobbies...

17:33.683 --> 17:35.493
And I have mine.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.337
You think this is funny?

17:41.361 --> 17:43.739
Oh, don't you get it?

17:43.763 --> 17:46.243
We just got our baby back.

17:51.341 --> 17:53.401
Um...

17:56.676 --> 17:58.676
Well, you take care now.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.710
Ahem. Yeah.

18:05.785 --> 18:06.762
Hi.

18:06.786 --> 18:08.794
I got, uh, your message

18:08.818 --> 18:11.767
that you wanted to see me
before the meeting started.

18:11.791 --> 18:15.631
Yeah, I did. Um, there's someone
I'd like to introduce you to.

18:17.727 --> 18:20.106
Bree, this is Donna.

18:20.130 --> 18:23.109
Donna, this is Bree. What's up?

18:23.133 --> 18:24.180
Hi.

18:24.204 --> 18:26.712
Donna is gonna be
your new sponsor.

18:26.736 --> 18:29.485
I, um, I don't want
a new sponsor.

18:29.509 --> 18:32.509
I'm... I'm very comfortable
working with you.

18:34.784 --> 18:38.364
Look, this was always
just a temporary arrangement.

18:38.388 --> 18:40.366
And given what happened
the other night,

18:40.390 --> 18:42.828
I think it's best
if we just end this now.

18:42.852 --> 18:45.202
Peter, all we did was kiss.

18:49.529 --> 18:52.878
We'd be kidding ourselves
if we didn't think that

18:52.902 --> 18:56.346
whatever's between us isn't
going to affect our recovery.

18:56.370 --> 18:59.545
It's not a good time
for change in my life, Peter.

18:59.569 --> 19:03.189
Terrible things are happening.
I'm headed to court.

19:03.213 --> 19:05.600
I need your support
now more than ever.

19:05.624 --> 19:07.553
You'll have support, Bree.

19:07.577 --> 19:09.555
It just won't be mine.

19:09.579 --> 19:10.919
But, Peter...

19:14.684 --> 19:17.132
Oh, Bree could never
have done that!

19:17.156 --> 19:19.165
I'm just telling you
what the lawyer said.

19:19.189 --> 19:21.407
So you think Bree
punched Andrew in the face?

19:21.431 --> 19:22.908
'Cause I don't.

19:22.932 --> 19:26.272
I don't either,
but on the other hand,

19:26.296 --> 19:29.275
she spanked my kids,
she lied about her drinking

19:29.299 --> 19:32.678
and I once saw her bitch slap
her mother-in-law.

19:32.702 --> 19:34.420
So I'm torn.

19:34.444 --> 19:36.752
Well, I'm siding with Bree.

19:36.776 --> 19:39.925
How can you be so sure?

19:39.949 --> 19:43.529
We have Andrew saying that
it's systematic physical abuse.

19:43.553 --> 19:45.531
And then we have Bree saying

19:45.555 --> 19:47.533
it's Andrew
wanting to be emancipated

19:47.557 --> 19:50.536
so he can get at his trust fund
so he can buy a car.

19:50.560 --> 19:52.798
How are we supposed to know
the real truth?

19:52.822 --> 19:54.770
Because I remember being 17.

19:54.794 --> 19:57.803
And I would've done
a hell of a lot more

19:57.827 --> 20:00.667
than punch myself in the eye
to get a car.

20:04.934 --> 20:06.952
Karl!

20:06.976 --> 20:08.954
Karl, stop! Stop!

20:08.978 --> 20:10.816
Oh! It's an emergency.

20:10.840 --> 20:12.818
Just calm down. What's going on?

20:12.842 --> 20:15.861
Edie is gonna marry
you tomorrow. What?

20:15.885 --> 20:17.863
She's planned
this whole secret wedding.

20:17.887 --> 20:19.465
It's a surprise.

20:19.489 --> 20:21.827
God, I hate surprises!

20:21.851 --> 20:23.529
I know. I told her that.

20:23.553 --> 20:26.237
I said, "he always,
always hates surprises."

20:26.261 --> 20:28.804
All right, don't get yourself
all worked up here.

20:28.828 --> 20:32.238
Put our heads together.
We'll come up with something.

20:32.262 --> 20:34.580
So the thing
you gotta know about me

20:34.604 --> 20:36.382
is my style is proactive.

20:36.406 --> 20:38.814
I don't hold your hand
if you go on a bender.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.986
I believe
in behavior modification.

20:41.010 --> 20:43.549
Hmm. Some muffins?

20:43.573 --> 20:46.560
Oh. Oh, that's okay.
I-I'm not big on snacks.

20:46.584 --> 20:48.694
You should also know...

20:48.718 --> 20:50.018
I'm not a lesbian.

20:51.981 --> 20:53.829
Oh!

20:53.853 --> 20:55.361
Well, good for you.

20:55.385 --> 20:59.565
Well, see, if I was, the program
wouldn't let me be your sponsor.

20:59.589 --> 21:00.936
Not great for your recovery

21:00.960 --> 21:03.669
if we get tangled up
in a little somethin'.

21:03.693 --> 21:06.972
So, um, whatever vibe
you might be getting,

21:06.996 --> 21:08.696
that's all on you.

21:10.740 --> 21:12.670
Um, Donna...

21:14.904 --> 21:18.758
I-I really appreciate everything
that you've been doing for me,

21:18.782 --> 21:21.026
but I think I was really
making some progress

21:21.050 --> 21:22.988
with Peter as my sponsor.

21:23.012 --> 21:24.530
And I was thinking...

21:24.554 --> 21:26.041
All right, stop right there!

21:26.065 --> 21:27.863
You're fixating on Peter.

21:27.887 --> 21:30.436
Well, I just really feel like
I'm jeopardizing my recovery

21:30.460 --> 21:32.868
by switching...
You're making excuses.

21:32.892 --> 21:36.972
See, I have a 99% success rate
as a sponsor

21:36.996 --> 21:39.645
because I have 0% tolerance

21:39.669 --> 21:41.847
for people
who lie to themselves.

21:41.871 --> 21:43.349
Now come on.

21:43.373 --> 21:45.651
Come on? Where are we going?

21:45.675 --> 21:48.935
Hiking. There's nothing like it
to take your mind off booze.

21:51.641 --> 21:52.918
I got it!

21:52.942 --> 21:55.626
I'll just be the woman.
I'll say I want a big wedding.

21:55.650 --> 21:57.623
You know, the church,
the big ballroom,

21:57.647 --> 21:59.995
smushing cake in her face...
It'll take months to plan.

22:00.019 --> 22:02.868
That's great. And of course,
I'll have to tell her

22:02.892 --> 22:04.870
you're the one
who ruined the surprise.

22:04.894 --> 22:07.011
You're gonna makemetake the hit?

22:07.035 --> 22:08.396
Yeah.

22:10.400 --> 22:13.078
Hey, guys.
What you doing out here?

22:13.102 --> 22:15.381
Uh, just talking.

22:15.405 --> 22:17.983
Oh, well, come on in.
I've got something to show you.

22:18.007 --> 22:20.085
Oh, no, that's okay.

22:20.109 --> 22:21.909
Come on! You'll love this.

22:25.845 --> 22:30.015
Wait until I leave to tell her,
'cause she's gonna kill me.

22:34.854 --> 22:37.363
Well, I should go.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.736
I'm not gonna scream or cry

22:40.760 --> 22:42.738
or pound your faces in
with a mallet,

22:42.762 --> 22:45.471
which, lord knows, is my right.

22:45.495 --> 22:47.473
But what I will say
is that you two

22:47.497 --> 22:50.376
are the most reprehensible
excuses for human beings

22:50.400 --> 22:53.078
that I have ever met!

22:53.102 --> 22:56.112
Do you have anything to add?

23:00.980 --> 23:04.550
Right. What the hell.

23:07.417 --> 23:09.157
Oh! Get out! Get...

23:35.715 --> 23:37.463
Hey, Mrs. Scavo.

23:37.487 --> 23:40.025
That's a... That's a sweet ride.

23:40.049 --> 23:43.168
Yeah, you think so?

23:43.192 --> 23:45.170
Why don't you
come over here for a second?

23:45.194 --> 23:47.604
I'd like to pick your brain.

23:50.830 --> 23:53.108
You're the demographic
that my client is interested in,

23:53.132 --> 23:55.110
so you'd actually
be doing me a favor

23:55.134 --> 23:57.121
if you drove it around
for a couple hours,

23:57.145 --> 24:00.616
and tell me what you thought.
Do you mind?

24:00.640 --> 24:03.118
Are you kidding me?

24:03.142 --> 24:06.026
I can't believe
you are old enough to drive.

24:06.050 --> 24:08.153
I still remember
when you were 10 years old.

24:08.177 --> 24:10.626
I paid you a dollar
to rake our leaves.

24:10.650 --> 24:11.827
Yeah.

24:11.851 --> 24:13.629
Yeah, you were pretty cheap.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.704
Is this set up for mp3?

24:18.728 --> 24:21.036
Uh, all the bells and whistles,

24:21.060 --> 24:22.808
but listen...

24:22.832 --> 24:25.649
I really wanted to tell you
how sorry I am.

24:25.673 --> 24:27.495
Hmm?

24:29.238 --> 24:31.817
Your lawyer came to see me.

24:31.841 --> 24:34.980
I'm going to be deposed.

24:35.004 --> 24:38.053
It's going to be hard for me...

24:38.077 --> 24:41.857
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

24:41.881 --> 24:44.229
You just have to remember

24:44.253 --> 24:47.192
she's a different person
when she drinks.

24:47.216 --> 24:49.134
She must be.

24:49.158 --> 24:51.637
It's hard for me to imagine
the Bree I know

24:51.661 --> 24:53.499
capable of hurting you.

24:53.523 --> 24:56.001
Yeah.

24:56.025 --> 24:57.503
Do you have the keys?

24:57.527 --> 24:59.875
Oh. Sure.

24:59.899 --> 25:01.907
Anyway, I just...

25:01.931 --> 25:05.511
I feel so guilty that this
all went on in your house,

25:05.535 --> 25:07.913
right under our nose.

25:07.937 --> 25:11.486
So if there is anything
I can do to help you...

25:11.510 --> 25:13.940
Well, can you get
a discount on these?

25:16.215 --> 25:18.493
Um...

25:18.517 --> 25:21.266
Actually, yeah.
One of the perks.

25:21.290 --> 25:23.629
Even so, it's a little out
of the price range

25:23.653 --> 25:25.631
of a high school student.

25:25.655 --> 25:27.633
Well, if you tell
my lawyer the truth,

25:27.657 --> 25:31.236
I don't think
money's gonna be a problem.

25:35.304 --> 25:37.244
Hi. What's going on?

25:41.671 --> 25:46.021
Edie wants to discuss
our little... deception.

25:46.045 --> 25:49.655
Exactly how ugly
is this gonna get?

25:49.679 --> 25:53.999
How long does it take
to shut a door?

25:54.023 --> 25:56.031
I can forgive your trickery.

25:56.055 --> 25:59.134
I can forgive the humiliation.

25:59.158 --> 26:00.906
But what I can't forgive

26:00.930 --> 26:03.609
is the complete
and utter lack of faith in me!

26:03.633 --> 26:07.247
I mean, having Susan get married
for insurance was my idea!

26:07.271 --> 26:09.244
Okay, so if I'd known
that everything

26:09.268 --> 26:12.217
had gotten all screwed up,
of course I would've agreed.

26:12.241 --> 26:14.580
Look, Edie, in retrospect...

26:14.604 --> 26:16.782
Yes, we didn't think.

26:16.806 --> 26:21.056
We didn't handle this the way
mature adults should have.

26:21.080 --> 26:24.059
He's right.
We behaved like children...

26:24.083 --> 26:26.732
Naughty, stupid children.

26:26.756 --> 26:30.796
Well, that makes me feel better
that you could admit that.

26:32.021 --> 26:36.141
Because...
When naughty children misbehave,

26:36.165 --> 26:38.695
they know that they're
gonna get punished. Don't they?

26:41.831 --> 26:42.808
Punished?

26:42.832 --> 26:44.579
Mm-hmm. At this point,

26:44.603 --> 26:48.190
I'd like to point out that, uh,
it was Karl who proposed.

26:48.214 --> 26:49.915
Karl.

26:49.939 --> 26:53.659
You are gonna throw me
an elaborate wedding.

26:53.683 --> 26:56.261
Yes, of course.

26:56.285 --> 26:59.324
Anything, baby.

26:59.348 --> 27:01.927
How elaborate?

27:01.951 --> 27:05.300
Well, figure out exactly what
it is that you could afford,

27:05.324 --> 27:07.034
and triple it.

27:08.627 --> 27:12.277
As for you... okay,
now remember, I'm broke.

27:12.301 --> 27:14.609
I'm well aware
of your church mouse status.

27:14.633 --> 27:18.283
I don't intend to lift a finger

27:18.307 --> 27:20.646
during the planning
and execution

27:20.670 --> 27:24.720
of this crushingly expensive
wedding.

27:24.744 --> 27:26.722
No. No, of course not.

27:26.746 --> 27:29.294
And anything I can do to help...

27:29.318 --> 27:31.827
Uh, you know, I would... I could
help with the engagement party.

27:31.851 --> 27:32.958
How's that?

27:32.982 --> 27:36.702
Well, I wasn't planning
on inviting you.

27:36.726 --> 27:38.403
But...

27:38.427 --> 27:40.087
I will need a bartender.

27:42.161 --> 27:43.669
Oh, oh, and, um...

27:43.693 --> 27:46.203
Make sure you come in
through the back door.

27:55.074 --> 27:57.422
You're just in time.

27:57.446 --> 28:03.028
Mrs. Scavo has been sworn in,
so we're all ready to start.

28:03.052 --> 28:04.029
Hey.

28:04.053 --> 28:06.093
Hi.

28:12.922 --> 28:15.200
All right,
we are now on the record.

28:15.224 --> 28:17.342
Okay.

28:17.366 --> 28:20.445
Isn't it true that while your
children were in Bree's care,

28:20.469 --> 28:22.147
that she passed out drunk

28:22.171 --> 28:26.341
and allowed them to wander off
to a downtown business district?

28:30.409 --> 28:35.190
My kids don't wander.
They scurry, like rats.

28:35.214 --> 28:38.331
Excuse me? Do you know
a rat can fit through a hole

28:38.355 --> 28:40.025
the size of a quarter?

28:40.049 --> 28:43.028
Anyway, my children
have that trick down, too.

28:43.052 --> 28:44.399
Mrs. Scavo, are you saying

28:44.423 --> 28:46.737
that you don't hold
Mrs. Van De Kamp responsible

28:46.761 --> 28:48.774
for endangering your children?

28:48.798 --> 28:51.106
No, I don't
hold her responsible.

28:51.130 --> 28:54.339
Bree Van De Kamp and I have
known each other a long time.

28:54.363 --> 28:56.041
I trust her completely.

28:56.065 --> 28:58.213
She's a wonderful friend
and a fantastic mother.

28:58.237 --> 29:01.286
She puts the rest of us
to shame.

29:01.310 --> 29:04.319
She's lying! Are you gonna
let her get away with this crap?

29:04.343 --> 29:06.351
Please.

29:07.847 --> 29:10.996
Do you consider Mrs. Van De Kamp
to have a drinking problem?

29:11.020 --> 29:13.999
No.

29:14.023 --> 29:16.510
Then why did you line
empty wine bottles

29:16.534 --> 29:18.203
up on her front stoop?

29:18.227 --> 29:21.837
I was helping Bree
with her recycling.

29:21.861 --> 29:24.069
Do I need to remind you

29:24.093 --> 29:26.520
of the potential consequences
of perjury?

29:26.544 --> 29:30.995
No, you don't.
In fact, I hate liars.

29:54.193 --> 29:55.170
Hello?

29:55.194 --> 29:58.343
Peter. Hi, it's Bree.

29:58.367 --> 29:59.975
Hey, Bree.

29:59.999 --> 30:02.878
You know, um, if you feel like
you're gonna need a drink,

30:02.902 --> 30:04.349
you should call Donna.

30:04.373 --> 30:07.352
No! No, I-I don't feel like
I'm gonna drink.

30:07.376 --> 30:09.454
And if I did,
I certainlywouldcall Donna.

30:09.478 --> 30:12.958
I mean, she and I are just...
We're just really clicking.

30:12.982 --> 30:15.120
Oh, that's good.
So why are you calling?

30:15.144 --> 30:18.028
I know it's really late notice,
but a friend of mine, uh,

30:18.052 --> 30:20.025
got engaged
and she's throwing a party,

30:20.049 --> 30:22.027
and I thought, um,
maybe you'd like to come.

30:22.051 --> 30:23.098
Bree...

30:23.122 --> 30:25.230
Well, you're not
my sponsor anymore,

30:25.254 --> 30:27.802
so I assume this is allowable.

30:27.826 --> 30:29.804
I mean, it's just
a casual get-together.

30:29.828 --> 30:32.938
And they're having Sushi.
You do like Sushi, don't you?

30:32.962 --> 30:33.939
Bree...

30:39.108 --> 30:42.988
Okay, Peter, I just really...

30:43.012 --> 30:44.890
Need us to be friends.

30:44.914 --> 30:46.897
When I'm with you,
I'm not myself,

30:46.921 --> 30:47.953
which is a good thing.

30:47.977 --> 30:50.825
I can... I can relax
when I'm with you

30:50.849 --> 30:54.329
in a way that I can't
when I'm with other people.

30:55.624 --> 30:58.611
With them, I have to pretend
that I have it all together,

30:58.635 --> 31:01.106
but...

31:01.130 --> 31:04.239
You know that I don't,
so it's just so much easier.

31:04.263 --> 31:06.511
Come on, it's just a...

31:06.535 --> 31:08.513
It's just a dumb old party.

31:08.537 --> 31:10.615
Bree...

31:10.639 --> 31:12.299
Do not call me again.

31:18.447 --> 31:20.425
Oh!

31:20.449 --> 31:22.527
Paul! I am so glad you made it.

31:22.551 --> 31:24.629
I appreciate
the invitation, Edie.

31:24.653 --> 31:26.992
Although, frankly, I'm a little
surprised to get it

31:27.016 --> 31:29.194
considering how people in
this neighborhood feel about me.

31:29.218 --> 31:33.098
Oh. You know me.
I like to be inclusive.

31:33.122 --> 31:34.599
Ooh! It's heavy.

31:36.926 --> 31:39.274
Uh, unh-unh. This is flat.

31:39.298 --> 31:41.346
I think I'd like, um...

31:41.370 --> 31:43.048
A rusty nail.

31:43.072 --> 31:44.509
A what now?

31:44.533 --> 31:45.911
It's a cocktail,

31:45.935 --> 31:47.452
well, I'm not really sure
what's in it.

31:47.476 --> 31:51.186
But it sounds obscure
and complicated, so chop-chop.

31:52.381 --> 31:54.289
Be right there.

31:54.313 --> 31:56.396
Hey, hey. Put that down.
We gotta go.

31:56.420 --> 31:59.264
Our birth mother just
went into labor. What?

31:59.288 --> 32:03.028
That's fantastic! Yeah,
can you believe it? We're gonna be parents.

32:03.052 --> 32:05.030
I'll go get
the car. Come on.

32:05.054 --> 32:07.007
We were supposed to have
four weeks.

32:07.031 --> 32:10.035
She promised me the baby
wasn't due for four more weeks.

32:10.059 --> 32:12.307
We don't have anything!
We don't... we don't have diapers,

32:12.331 --> 32:14.639
and we don't have
the stuff babies drink.

32:14.663 --> 32:15.941
Formula.

32:15.965 --> 32:18.013
Exactly. We're not ready!

32:18.037 --> 32:20.215
You know, this is
a total inconvenience.

32:20.239 --> 32:24.089
Welcome to parenthood. Come on.

32:24.113 --> 32:26.096
This is
your father's bartender Bible.

32:26.120 --> 32:29.115
See if you can find a
recipe for a rusty nail. Okay.

32:34.253 --> 32:35.323
Um, mom?

32:38.087 --> 32:40.365
Where'd you find that?

32:40.389 --> 32:42.067
It was stuck in here

32:42.091 --> 32:44.639
between a pink squirrel
and a pisco sour.

32:44.663 --> 32:47.042
Oh.

32:47.066 --> 32:50.545
Well, why is your father
keeping this?

32:50.569 --> 32:53.039
Why do you think?

33:01.180 --> 33:03.028
Hey, susie.

33:03.052 --> 33:04.329
Karl, this marriage...

33:04.353 --> 33:06.036
Our marriage,
this fake marriage,

33:06.060 --> 33:08.063
that's what it is, right? Fake.

33:08.087 --> 33:09.634
What are you talking about?

33:09.658 --> 33:12.137
What's this?

33:12.161 --> 33:13.498
Nothing.

33:13.522 --> 33:16.101
Yeah? Mm-hmm.

33:16.125 --> 33:20.575
Okay, then, repeat after me.

33:20.599 --> 33:22.077
"Our marriage is fake,

33:22.101 --> 33:24.749
"and I'm going to marry
the woman ireallylove...

33:24.773 --> 33:26.111
Edie britt."

33:26.135 --> 33:28.253
If that's what
you want me to say.

33:28.277 --> 33:31.116
No, no, no, no! It's not about
whatiwant you to say.

33:31.140 --> 33:36.591
Youhave to want to say
that you want to marry Edie.

33:36.615 --> 33:38.623
Don't worry about this, susie.

33:38.647 --> 33:41.066
Why are you hanging on to that?

33:41.090 --> 33:43.198
I need to look at it
from time to time.

33:43.222 --> 33:44.369
Why?

33:48.697 --> 33:51.436
Consider it my punishment.

33:51.460 --> 33:55.130
For screwing up the best thing
that ever happened to me.

33:57.206 --> 34:02.187
Oh. Oh, no, no, no.
This is not happening.

34:02.211 --> 34:05.120
No, what? Mmm. Mmm!

34:05.144 --> 34:07.452
Oh, Karl! Oh! Will you...

34:07.476 --> 34:10.054
Are you crazy?! Just tell me what to do,
susie.

34:10.079 --> 34:12.056
If you want me
to marry Edie, I will.

34:12.081 --> 34:15.100
You want me to call off
the wedding, I'll do it.

34:15.123 --> 34:17.311
I'll do whatever you
want. I'm putty.

34:17.335 --> 34:19.204
Karl! Whoa!

34:21.830 --> 34:23.308
What are you doing?

34:23.331 --> 34:27.072
I'm, just, uh,
putting away some coats.

34:27.096 --> 34:28.243
Oh.

34:28.266 --> 34:30.475
Well, it's time
to open my presents.

34:30.498 --> 34:31.498
Let's go.

34:42.251 --> 34:45.251
♪♪♪

34:49.118 --> 34:50.395
Oh, hello.

34:50.418 --> 34:51.636
Hi.

34:51.659 --> 34:54.199
Hi. Um, I need some advice
from a professional.

34:54.223 --> 34:56.206
I'd like to get stinking drunk.

34:56.230 --> 34:59.795
Do you have anything that
can accomplish that in a hurry?

35:04.133 --> 35:06.116
I forgot the lamaze book
in my purse!

35:06.140 --> 35:08.435
Oh, forget it. Come on.
Let's go. We'll wing it.

35:11.780 --> 35:13.818
Oh, we missed it!

35:13.842 --> 35:16.269
The kid
just slipped right out.

35:16.293 --> 35:17.845
Are you family?

35:22.891 --> 35:24.351
They're the parents.

35:31.760 --> 35:34.739
Would you like to help?

35:34.763 --> 35:36.211
No, thanks.

35:36.235 --> 35:40.114
You guys look like
you got it covered.

35:40.138 --> 35:42.116
Oh, are you sure, honey?

35:42.140 --> 35:43.748
Come on, Gaby.

35:43.772 --> 35:46.120
I just, um...

35:46.144 --> 35:48.131
I-I don't wanna do anything
to screw it up.

35:48.155 --> 35:50.124
She won't break.

35:50.148 --> 35:52.457
Here.

35:52.481 --> 35:53.628
Okay.

35:57.286 --> 35:58.903
Hi.

35:58.927 --> 36:01.227
Hi.

36:04.393 --> 36:09.274
Oh, honey, you were right.

36:09.298 --> 36:10.638
About what?

36:14.903 --> 36:16.921
It was all worth it.

36:27.185 --> 36:29.894
Serving bowls.
Just what I needed, Lynette.

36:29.918 --> 36:32.837
There's a gift receipt
taped to the bottom of the box.

36:32.861 --> 36:34.621
Oh. Thank god!

36:36.665 --> 36:39.674
Okay, the next one
is from Felicia.

36:39.698 --> 36:42.347
I do hope you like it.

36:42.371 --> 36:44.349
Oh, you know what they say...

36:44.373 --> 36:47.852
Good things
come in small packages.

36:52.281 --> 36:54.281
What is it?

36:56.715 --> 36:57.862
Teeth?

36:57.886 --> 36:59.224
Dentures.

37:01.219 --> 37:03.898
They were
my dear sister Martha's.

37:03.922 --> 37:06.909
I'm sure none of you knew,
but she had orthodontic issues

37:06.933 --> 37:09.974
from the time she was a child.

37:09.998 --> 37:13.308
Oh.

37:13.332 --> 37:14.639
Thank you.

37:14.663 --> 37:18.317
I know it's an unconventional
gift for an engagement party,

37:18.341 --> 37:20.545
but you and Martha
were such close friends, Edie.

37:20.569 --> 37:22.547
I wanted you to have
something truly personal

37:22.571 --> 37:24.249
to remember her by,

37:24.273 --> 37:27.452
since she left us so...
Abruptly.

37:27.476 --> 37:28.953
You know,

37:28.977 --> 37:31.256
when Paul young strangled her,
crushed her windpipe

37:31.280 --> 37:33.328
and buried her alive

37:33.352 --> 37:35.760
next to a garbage-strewn
hiking trail.

37:35.784 --> 37:38.664
Felicia, uh...
I think you've had enough.

37:40.359 --> 37:43.338
I do apologize
if I've offended anyone,

37:43.362 --> 37:46.811
but... while you all
are chitchatting

37:46.835 --> 37:49.314
and eating
these gummy hors d'oeuvres,

37:49.338 --> 37:50.675
just remember...

37:50.699 --> 37:53.439
You're in the company
of a murderer.

38:19.297 --> 38:22.297
♪♪♪

38:30.679 --> 38:33.057
Bree?

38:33.081 --> 38:34.081
Bree?

38:40.389 --> 38:42.467
Why didn't you call Donna?

38:42.491 --> 38:45.530
Hmm.

38:45.554 --> 38:48.373
I don't need Donna.

38:48.397 --> 38:50.557
I need you.

39:07.345 --> 39:10.345
You know,
I don't even like redheads.

39:14.352 --> 39:15.630
Okay, it's my turn.

39:15.654 --> 39:18.433
Shh. In a minute.

39:18.457 --> 39:21.506
Come on, you're hogging her.

39:21.530 --> 39:24.439
Tell me!
You tell me who it is, Libby.

39:24.463 --> 39:25.940
Are you drunk?

39:25.964 --> 39:27.912
Who is he, Libby? Hmm?

39:27.936 --> 39:30.044
I got to know.

39:30.068 --> 39:32.577
I already told you,
he's just some rodeo guy.

39:32.601 --> 39:34.949
I don't even remember
his name. Liar!

39:36.405 --> 39:38.853
What are you doing?

39:38.877 --> 39:40.585
I am gonna light myself on fire.

39:40.609 --> 39:43.828
He's gonna light himself on fire
with coffee liqueur?

39:43.852 --> 39:45.690
Would not have been my choice.

39:45.714 --> 39:48.393
Tell me his name,
or I'm gonna do it!

39:48.417 --> 39:49.964
Frank, you're being an idiot.

39:49.988 --> 39:51.466
Aah! Aah!

39:51.490 --> 39:53.398
It was Dale, okay? It was Dale.

39:53.422 --> 39:55.970
Security to maternity.

39:55.994 --> 40:00.074
My brother Dale? He's a kid!

40:00.098 --> 40:02.877
Well, he's 19, frank.
He knows which end is up.

40:02.901 --> 40:06.551
Wait, what is she saying?

40:06.575 --> 40:08.983
There's a father.

40:09.007 --> 40:10.384
Hey! Hey!

40:12.511 --> 40:13.958
No. Leave me alone!

40:13.982 --> 40:15.620
I'm not giving up the baby.

40:15.644 --> 40:18.523
Let's get him out of here.

40:18.547 --> 40:20.094
No! No!

40:20.118 --> 40:21.966
Security to o-b.
Security to o-b, stat.

40:21.990 --> 40:23.968
What the hell are you doing?

40:23.992 --> 40:25.470
Taking our baby home.

40:25.494 --> 40:27.481
She's not ours.
The papers aren't valid anymore.

40:27.505 --> 40:29.504
She has a father.

40:29.528 --> 40:31.506
Do youreallywanna leave
this beautiful little girl

40:31.530 --> 40:33.478
with that
white trash freak show?!

40:33.502 --> 40:34.979
Huh?

40:35.003 --> 40:36.781
Well, come on, then.

40:43.712 --> 40:45.149
Where?

40:45.173 --> 40:46.821
Maternity. Maternity.

40:46.845 --> 40:48.445
All right.

40:52.651 --> 40:53.698
Hurry up!

40:53.722 --> 40:55.700
I'm hurrying.

40:58.126 --> 41:00.565
Man, there's a lot
of straps on this thing!

41:00.589 --> 41:03.838
How does this thing go in?
Read the instructions!

41:03.862 --> 41:05.740
"Pass strap 'a'
through strap 'b, '

41:05.764 --> 41:08.478
making sure that the harness
clip is at the chest level."

41:08.502 --> 41:11.476
Well, which damn one is the
harness clip? That isafter the baby is in.

41:11.500 --> 41:13.447
You have to connect it
to the car first!

41:13.471 --> 41:15.449
I told you
we should've got an s.U.V.!

41:15.473 --> 41:18.127
Okay, stop yelling!
This is very complicated.

41:18.151 --> 41:20.146
Oh, for god's sakes.
Just take the baby.

41:24.883 --> 41:27.592
Wow. We're good to go.

41:27.616 --> 41:30.635
Give me the baby.

41:33.491 --> 41:35.469
You know
this isn't gonna end well.

41:35.493 --> 41:38.080
You know, they're just gonna
try and take her back.

41:38.104 --> 41:42.246
Maybe. But we don't
have to make it easy for them.

41:42.270 --> 41:43.578
Gaby, I...

41:43.602 --> 41:46.032
Look, just buckle up!

41:54.843 --> 41:57.692
Temptation comes to all of us.

41:57.716 --> 41:59.694
Whether or not we succumb

41:59.718 --> 42:05.029
depends on our ability
to recognize its disguise.

42:05.053 --> 42:09.634
Sometimes it arrives
in the form of an old flame,

42:09.658 --> 42:12.128
flickering back to life.

42:13.862 --> 42:15.540
Or a new friend

42:15.564 --> 42:19.674
who could end up being
so much more.

42:23.211 --> 42:25.089
Or a young child

42:25.113 --> 42:30.183
who awakens feelings
we didn't know we had.

42:31.780 --> 42:35.560
And so we give in to temptation,

42:35.584 --> 42:39.934
all the while knowing
come morning,

42:39.958 --> 42:42.958
we'll have to suffer
the consequences.
