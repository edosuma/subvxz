WEBVTT

00:24.800 --> 00:26.768
Hello.

00:26.880 --> 00:29.180
I come from outside the wall,

00:29.280 --> 00:31.681
where we have all
but destroyed each other.

00:34.840 --> 00:38.180
We designed your city as an experiment.

00:38.280 --> 00:42.729
We believe it is the only way to recover
the humanity we have lost.

00:44.240 --> 00:48.580
And we created factions to ensure peace.

00:48.680 --> 00:50.740
But we believe there will be
those among you

00:50.840 --> 00:53.923
who will transcend these factions.

00:54.040 --> 00:56.580
These will be the Divergent.

00:56.680 --> 00:59.460
They are the true purpose
of this experiment.

00:59.560 --> 01:03.580
They are vital to humanity's survival.

01:03.680 --> 01:05.140
If you're watching this now,

01:05.239 --> 01:09.086
then at least one of you is proof
that our experiment has succeeded.

01:10.480 --> 01:14.610
The time has come for you to emerge
from your isolation and rejoin us.

01:14.720 --> 01:18.100
On Evelyn's orders,
this gate is now closed.

01:18.200 --> 01:21.700
We've allowed you to believe
that you're the last of us.

01:21.800 --> 01:24.060
But you're not.

01:24.160 --> 01:29.291
Mankind waits for you,
with hope, beyond the wall.

01:57.840 --> 01:59.171
We're almost there.

02:00.520 --> 02:01.620
Yeah, I'm right behind you.

02:01.720 --> 02:05.540
What, are you afraid of heights?

02:05.640 --> 02:07.961
No. Who told you that?

02:15.360 --> 02:17.540
Sometimes, when I look past the wall,

02:17.640 --> 02:20.564
I think that I can see
something out there.

02:21.560 --> 02:24.820
- Do you?
- No. I don't.

02:24.920 --> 02:27.048
Maybe you need to look harder.

02:27.160 --> 02:30.528
I am looking.
I'm just not seeing what you're seeing.

02:31.520 --> 02:33.727
When it's right
in front of your face, you will.

02:35.520 --> 02:37.010
So we're really gonna do this?

02:40.200 --> 02:42.043
Yeah.

02:57.160 --> 02:59.420
People of Chicago...

02:59.520 --> 03:02.500
I know you're curious
about what's beyond the wall,

03:02.600 --> 03:05.620
but sometimes walls
are there to protect us.

03:05.720 --> 03:10.089
Remember, the Founders were the ones
who divided us into factions.

03:10.200 --> 03:14.500
So until we know their intentions,
the wall must stay closed.

03:14.600 --> 03:17.100
Jeanine is dead.

03:17.200 --> 03:19.700
Today, we begin the trials
of her conspirators, and mark...

03:19.800 --> 03:23.180
Put the traitors on trial,
close down the gate.

03:23.280 --> 03:25.561
Didn't take her long to make
the same mistakes as Jeanine.

03:25.600 --> 03:28.080
I need to talk to her.

03:28.200 --> 03:30.328
I still think I can bring her around.

03:31.320 --> 03:34.220
But that doesn't change anything, right?

03:34.320 --> 03:35.606
No.

03:42.560 --> 03:44.562
I need you to get some things for me.

03:48.160 --> 03:49.780
Just this?

03:49.880 --> 03:51.780
You're sure you don't want
the sun and moon as well?

03:51.880 --> 03:54.860
- I know it's a lot.
- It's impossible.

03:54.960 --> 03:57.440
- So?
- So I'll make it happen.

04:10.040 --> 04:12.620
Well, hello, ladies.
Where we going? Can I come?

04:12.720 --> 04:15.121
- Give it up, Peter.
- Oh, so hostile!

04:15.240 --> 04:17.339
There's no factions.
We can be friends, right?

04:17.440 --> 04:19.442
Can't we all just get along?

04:21.120 --> 04:22.406
Tris.

04:24.800 --> 04:28.220
You should be up there
with all the other leaders of the city.

04:28.320 --> 04:31.340
No, that's not me.
I don't wanna make the rules.

04:31.440 --> 04:33.180
Great leaders don't seek power.

04:33.280 --> 04:35.460
They're called by necessity.

04:35.560 --> 04:37.562
The people need you.

04:54.880 --> 04:58.380
Look at me! Look at me! You rat!

04:58.480 --> 05:01.245
- Back up!
- You ready to die today?

05:01.360 --> 05:03.420
That's right! Yeah!

05:03.520 --> 05:05.260
Move!

05:05.360 --> 05:06.700
Just sit tight.

05:06.800 --> 05:08.131
String his ass up!

05:10.320 --> 05:13.220
We all find ourselves on new ground.

05:13.320 --> 05:16.140
I dedicated my life to seeking the truth.

05:16.240 --> 05:18.540
But under Jeanine, it passed me by.

05:18.640 --> 05:21.564
And for that, I humbly apologize.

05:28.480 --> 05:29.740
But my personal failure

05:29.840 --> 05:33.845
has only strengthened my resolve
to make things right.

05:35.400 --> 05:38.580
While the faction of Candor
may no longer exist,

05:38.680 --> 05:43.060
I want everyone to know that I will not
stop leading the pursuit of honesty

05:43.160 --> 05:45.380
as we rebuild our city.

05:45.480 --> 05:46.970
Yeah!

05:50.680 --> 05:54.500
Let the trials begin!
Justice will be done!

05:54.600 --> 05:55.840
Yeah!

05:59.200 --> 06:00.440
Yeah.

06:04.360 --> 06:06.169
May the truth set you free.

06:11.520 --> 06:14.740
Now there is no doubt, Max, that you
helped Jeanine take over Chicago

06:14.840 --> 06:18.460
and exert brutal control
over its citizens.

06:18.560 --> 06:21.723
So my only question to you is this...

06:22.720 --> 06:26.441
Did you feel justified in murdering
people in support of her regime?

06:27.800 --> 06:30.180
Absolutely.

06:30.280 --> 06:32.460
People are sheep.

06:32.560 --> 06:35.020
They need a shepherd to guide them.

06:35.120 --> 06:37.380
And when they resist,

06:37.480 --> 06:39.244
they're slaughtered.

06:41.120 --> 06:43.460
- Monster.
- We should slaughter you!

06:43.560 --> 06:45.140
Kill him!

06:45.240 --> 06:47.060
Yeah, kill him!

06:47.160 --> 06:50.403
Kill him! Kill him now!

06:56.000 --> 06:58.900
- Kill him!
- Don't kill him!

06:59.000 --> 07:00.460
- Let him live!
- Kill him!

07:00.560 --> 07:02.324
- Let him live!
- Kill him now!

07:02.440 --> 07:03.980
Rise above it!

07:04.080 --> 07:05.540
You can't do this! Stop it!

07:05.640 --> 07:07.660
Let him live! We're better than this!

07:07.760 --> 07:09.683
- Rise above it!
- No!

07:16.440 --> 07:20.809
Jeanine... Jeanine is dead.

07:22.200 --> 07:24.180
Let's not keep her spirit alive.

07:24.280 --> 07:26.282
- Kill him!
- Let him live!

07:30.520 --> 07:32.329
What are you going to do?

07:32.440 --> 07:34.442
They need an answer.

07:41.200 --> 07:43.328
This is an execution.

07:43.480 --> 07:46.484
No. This is a trial.

07:48.160 --> 07:53.041
And I yield to the wishes of the people.

07:53.160 --> 07:57.540
It is time that we break from the past.

07:57.640 --> 07:59.210
Yeah!

08:18.080 --> 08:20.367
Kill him!

08:20.520 --> 08:22.020
He needs to die!

08:22.120 --> 08:24.930
- He's a murderer!
- He should die!

08:38.280 --> 08:40.500
I don't wanna die.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.169
Neither did your sheep.

08:52.080 --> 08:54.321
Whoo! Yeah!

08:56.120 --> 09:00.921
There was a time I would've said,
"I leave you in love, not malice."

09:02.440 --> 09:04.408
That time is past.

09:11.080 --> 09:13.020
- Coward!
- Traitor!

09:13.120 --> 09:16.580
Get out! Get out!

09:16.680 --> 09:18.300
Traitor!

09:18.400 --> 09:20.100
Get out, now! Get out!

09:20.200 --> 09:22.931
Out, out, out! Get out! Out!

09:23.640 --> 09:25.180
Beatrice!

09:25.280 --> 09:26.645
I'm sorry.

09:28.560 --> 09:32.485
You incited a mob.
Good luck controlling them.

09:36.080 --> 09:39.860
Beatrice, please! Don't let them kill me!

09:39.960 --> 09:41.610
Beatrice, no!

09:42.600 --> 09:44.170
Beatrice!

09:46.960 --> 09:48.900
What the hell do you think you're doing?

09:49.000 --> 09:50.860
We need to show a united front,

09:50.960 --> 09:53.620
especially since Tris
refuses to stand with us.

09:53.720 --> 09:56.740
- I'm not gonna tell Tris what to do.
- Well, you need to try.

09:56.840 --> 10:01.700
Do you really think that you can
stop people leaving this city?

10:01.800 --> 10:03.500
The wall's on total lockdown.

10:03.600 --> 10:06.410
My soldiers have orders. No one gets out.

10:11.280 --> 10:14.340
Why did you go to war with Jeanine

10:14.440 --> 10:16.602
if you were just gonna become her?

10:21.040 --> 10:24.249
Leaders need to make tough decisions
to protect their people.

10:27.360 --> 10:30.170
You'll understand that
when you take over for me.

10:42.680 --> 10:44.444
I'm doing this for you.

11:03.680 --> 11:05.887
You know, it might
not be the best time to leave.

11:07.040 --> 11:10.020
I know, but we can't be here
for every fight.

11:10.120 --> 11:12.700
And the message said to come out
and meet the rest of the world.

11:12.800 --> 11:15.740
And we know absolutely nothing
about the people who sent it.

11:15.840 --> 11:17.842
But aren't you curious to find out?

11:19.520 --> 11:21.841
What about our home?

11:23.200 --> 11:26.420
I don't think our home exists anymore.

11:26.520 --> 11:29.060
Maybe the way to help Chicago
is going beyond the wall.

11:29.160 --> 11:31.970
And what if there's nothing out there?
What if there is nothing left?

11:33.400 --> 11:35.562
I can live with that if you're with me.

11:35.680 --> 11:37.682
But I cannot live without trying.

11:42.880 --> 11:44.740
You know, it's Caleb's trial tomorrow.

11:44.840 --> 11:46.251
Yeah, I know.

11:50.600 --> 11:53.331
I don't owe him anything.

11:54.320 --> 11:57.369
No. No, you don't.

12:32.520 --> 12:34.568
I'm gonna deal with this one.

12:36.520 --> 12:38.522
You think I'm asking your permission?

12:44.080 --> 12:45.700
No, please, Four. No.

12:45.800 --> 12:49.122
Four. Four, please,
don't kill me, I'm sorry.

12:51.440 --> 12:53.180
Four, I'm sorry!

12:53.280 --> 12:55.100
You tried to kill your own sister, Caleb.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.440
You brought this on yourself.

13:15.520 --> 13:17.522
I'm sorry. For everything.

13:22.160 --> 13:24.162
Come on. We're going up.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.286
Come on, come on.

13:31.320 --> 13:33.322
- Beatrice?
- Walk slowly.

13:34.320 --> 13:35.560
Hey!

13:37.400 --> 13:40.580
All Erudite prisoners are supposed
to be locked in the cages.

13:40.680 --> 13:43.126
Stop!

13:45.120 --> 13:47.407
I can handle this one myself.

14:06.400 --> 14:07.640
Bring 'em in!

14:11.920 --> 14:13.684
You can come out now, Caleb.

14:21.240 --> 14:24.380
Thank you, Four. Thank you.

14:24.480 --> 14:27.927
Don't thank me. It's your sister's idea.

14:37.600 --> 14:38.886
You saved me?

14:40.040 --> 14:42.486
It's what you do for family.

14:47.240 --> 14:49.720
Get in the car.

15:02.240 --> 15:04.447
I knew it.

15:09.760 --> 15:11.420
- Hey, partners.
- What are you doing, Peter?

15:11.520 --> 15:12.806
Get out of here.

15:12.920 --> 15:15.000
Yeah, that's what I'm doing.
I'm getting out of here.

15:16.600 --> 15:18.807
Look, I don't wanna be here
when your crazy mom

15:18.920 --> 15:21.844
goes around killing everybody
who used to work for Jeanine, okay?

15:23.080 --> 15:25.287
Look, I can join you guys,

15:25.400 --> 15:29.803
or I could... yell, "Help! Help!
Hey, they're getting away!"

15:29.920 --> 15:31.880
- Peter, get in the car.
- That's what I'm saying.

15:31.920 --> 15:33.160
- Get in the car.
- Thank you.

15:37.960 --> 15:39.803
What's up, Caleb?

15:41.000 --> 15:43.002
Yeah!

15:44.400 --> 15:46.402
You want the truth?

15:50.440 --> 15:52.442
He's dead! Yeah!

15:53.600 --> 15:55.204
Justice for all!

15:57.680 --> 16:00.160
You do have a plan, right?

16:31.480 --> 16:34.006
I didn't hear anything
about a prisoner transfer.

16:35.320 --> 16:37.049
Well, you're hearing it from me.

16:38.320 --> 16:39.890
Let me see your movement order.

16:47.280 --> 16:48.566
I got it.

16:49.560 --> 16:50.800
Right here.

16:52.280 --> 16:54.203
I got everything, just open the gate.

16:56.680 --> 16:58.900
One more, come on,
you want one more? Yeah...

16:59.000 --> 17:02.049
Edgar! Tobias Eaton
took Caleb Prior out of his cage.

17:04.560 --> 17:06.368
Come on, let's go, now.

17:07.359 --> 17:09.646
Come on, let's do some more!

17:12.040 --> 17:15.020
You a statue?

17:15.119 --> 17:16.451
Open the gate.

17:25.480 --> 17:27.482
Did they come through here?

17:31.560 --> 17:33.562
Let's get out of here.

17:36.520 --> 17:38.522
They're getting away.

17:58.400 --> 18:01.100
Tobias Eaton is abetting
Caleb Prior's escape.

18:01.200 --> 18:03.885
That makes him a traitor. Shoot to kill.

18:04.880 --> 18:08.521
Nobody goes over that wall.
We have our orders.

18:23.320 --> 18:25.482
- You ready?
- Yeah.

18:30.240 --> 18:32.481
Not the same as reading it in books, huh?

18:34.440 --> 18:36.249
Okay, coast is clear.

18:38.120 --> 18:39.963
It's time to see what's out there.

18:41.360 --> 18:43.806
Okay. On me.

18:58.680 --> 19:00.523
Shit. Release now!

19:20.080 --> 19:22.048
I got him.

19:22.160 --> 19:23.380
I'm sorry, Four.

19:23.480 --> 19:26.051
Come on, come on!

19:40.600 --> 19:41.840
Christina!

19:44.800 --> 19:46.086
I'm okay.

19:46.200 --> 19:48.220
That part of the plan, Stiff?

19:48.320 --> 19:50.846
Evelyn electrified the fence.

21:00.720 --> 21:01.881
Ugh!

21:33.600 --> 21:35.125
We did it.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.331
Tori?

21:42.320 --> 21:43.740
Tori!

21:43.840 --> 21:45.060
Tori. Tori!

21:45.160 --> 21:47.420
Tori! Oh, God. Tori?

21:47.520 --> 21:49.260
Come on. We gotta go. Come on.

21:49.360 --> 21:51.761
No! Tori!

21:54.480 --> 21:56.482
Bye, Tori...

22:12.040 --> 22:13.963
Load up! Load up!

22:50.720 --> 22:52.722
All right, let's go.

22:57.200 --> 22:59.771
Come on, it's this way.

23:23.400 --> 23:25.050
Holy shit.

23:29.080 --> 23:30.969
What happened here?

24:12.600 --> 24:15.060
Didn't exactly send out the welcome
committee for you, Stiff.

24:15.160 --> 24:16.700
Shut up, Peter.

24:16.800 --> 24:19.100
"Humanity welcomes you with hope."

24:19.200 --> 24:20.440
What humanity?

24:26.080 --> 24:28.367
This hole looks radioactive.

24:28.480 --> 24:32.121
Or at least it was in the last 200 years.

24:32.240 --> 24:33.460
Meaning what exactly?

24:33.560 --> 24:35.801
Somebody seriously messed up the world.

24:50.400 --> 24:51.765
Shit.

24:53.720 --> 24:55.404
Great. Now the sky's bleeding.

24:57.160 --> 24:58.420
This way.

24:58.520 --> 25:01.967
Come on, let's go. Now, come on.

25:19.120 --> 25:21.726
This is fun. I'm glad we did this.

25:24.960 --> 25:26.962
What if there's nothing else out there?

25:30.520 --> 25:32.409
There has to be.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.048
I'm scared.

25:42.320 --> 25:44.891
Yeah. I think that's a good thing.

26:30.200 --> 26:32.060
You guys hear that?

26:32.160 --> 26:34.731
- It's an engine.
- Someone's coming for us.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.401
- It's Edgar! Go, go!
- Go!

27:09.440 --> 27:11.010
Go, go! Cut back! Go!

27:18.640 --> 27:20.369
Hollis! No! Hollis!

27:50.480 --> 27:52.460
What?

27:52.560 --> 27:54.847
- Whoa! What is it?
- I don't...

27:57.080 --> 27:58.780
Don't be afraid.
There's nothing to worry about.

27:58.880 --> 28:00.220
You're safe now.

28:00.320 --> 28:01.560
Welcome, Four.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.500
Tris Prior, it's an honor to meet you.

28:03.600 --> 28:05.568
How do you know our names?

28:08.560 --> 28:09.686
What the...

28:14.440 --> 28:15.805
Uh-oh.

28:23.600 --> 28:26.444
Welcome to the future.
We've been waiting for you.

28:39.880 --> 28:42.451
Our plasma globes will protect you
from the toxicity.

29:15.040 --> 29:16.280
Hey...

29:19.160 --> 29:21.208
- We're gonna be okay.
- Yeah.

29:24.560 --> 29:25.846
Look.

29:36.960 --> 29:39.380
This is incredible.

29:39.480 --> 29:42.100
This is insane!

29:42.200 --> 29:44.806
Gadzooks!

30:18.240 --> 30:19.460
It's Tris!

30:19.560 --> 30:21.820
Welcome to the Bureau of Genetic Welfare.

30:21.920 --> 30:23.260
My name is Matthew.

30:23.360 --> 30:26.220
Now, let's get you into decontamination.

30:26.320 --> 30:27.540
It's them from Chicago.

30:27.640 --> 30:30.041
It's her, Tris Prior. She made it.

30:47.160 --> 30:49.020
There's nothing to worry about.

30:49.120 --> 30:52.567
You're being decontaminated
from the toxins which plague our world.

30:56.280 --> 30:59.329
Please remove your clothes and place
them in the incineration hatch.

31:27.800 --> 31:29.290
Please step forward.

31:36.680 --> 31:39.251
Place your feet on the mark.

32:18.080 --> 32:21.482
You're clean. Please place your arm
into the tube in the wall.

32:26.600 --> 32:28.980
There's nothing to worry about, Tris.

32:29.080 --> 32:31.287
Please place your arm into the tube.

32:52.280 --> 32:54.020
I've never felt so clean in my life.

32:54.120 --> 32:56.540
That was the best weird shower
I've ever had.

32:56.640 --> 32:58.500
Little cold...

32:58.600 --> 33:00.523
Hey, yours is different.

33:02.560 --> 33:03.891
Why are they all different?

33:13.920 --> 33:17.780
Hello and welcome
to the Bureau of Genetic Welfare.

33:17.880 --> 33:20.220
In the early part of the 21st century,

33:20.320 --> 33:23.100
scientists first discovered a way to map,

33:23.200 --> 33:25.140
then edit, the human genome.

33:25.240 --> 33:27.100
Or you can choose health.

33:27.200 --> 33:29.885
You can choose to settle
for merely adequate.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.260
Or you can choose excellent.

33:32.360 --> 33:35.980
A genetic solution puts you
in control of your life.

33:36.080 --> 33:38.380
So why just hope for a better future

33:38.480 --> 33:40.820
when you can choose perfection?

33:40.920 --> 33:43.220
Choose Perfexia.

33:43.320 --> 33:46.540
But what started as an attempt to erase
humanity's faults

33:46.640 --> 33:49.020
almost erased humanity itself.

33:49.120 --> 33:52.180
Genetic modification deepened
the rifts between people,

33:52.280 --> 33:55.380
and as they got more entrenched,
the world began to tear apart,

33:55.480 --> 33:59.644
until humanity crossed a line
from which it could never return.

34:01.480 --> 34:03.403
In the ashes of civilization,

34:03.520 --> 34:07.700
a small group of genetically
unmodified individuals

34:07.800 --> 34:11.500
established the Bureau
of Genetic Welfare here,

34:11.600 --> 34:13.820
at Chicago's O'Hare Airport.

34:13.920 --> 34:17.083
Our mission is to oversee
a grand experiment

34:17.199 --> 34:19.420
to purify the human genome.

34:19.520 --> 34:23.100
That experiment is the city of Chicago.

34:23.199 --> 34:25.500
Your participation in the Bureau's work

34:25.600 --> 34:28.842
means you are now
the guardians of the future.

34:28.960 --> 34:31.485
Your destiny begins today.

34:35.360 --> 34:37.931
Now, please follow me.

34:48.159 --> 34:50.242
What's an airport?

34:54.199 --> 34:57.540
Life in the Bureau can be demanding,
but the work is worth every sacrifice.

34:57.640 --> 34:58.860
It's them!

34:58.960 --> 35:00.962
We don't have all the resources
we would like, of course,

35:01.080 --> 35:03.780
but I think you'll find your
accommodations more than adequate.

35:03.880 --> 35:05.540
- Whoa!
- They're in person here!

35:05.640 --> 35:07.780
- Who are they?
- We bring them in from the Fringe,

35:07.880 --> 35:10.220
get them healthy,
give them a second chance.

35:10.320 --> 35:12.060
Hi, Four.

35:12.160 --> 35:14.660
- Hi, Four.
- Hey.

35:14.760 --> 35:16.580
How do they know who we are?

35:16.680 --> 35:19.260
The experiment is the entire focus
of the Bureau.

35:19.360 --> 35:20.780
Our surveillance technology

35:20.880 --> 35:23.900
is centuries ahead of anything
you've known in Chicago.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.940
They've grown up watching you.

35:26.040 --> 35:28.281
Nothing creepy about that.

35:29.720 --> 35:31.740
You have to forgive everyone for staring,

35:31.840 --> 35:35.731
but your arrival is the most exciting
event some of us have ever known.

35:36.920 --> 35:38.763
Welcome to your new home.

35:43.360 --> 35:44.820
Where's Four? Did you hurt him?

35:44.920 --> 35:46.700
I told you I wanted them unharmed.

35:46.800 --> 35:49.340
He went with them. Willingly.

35:49.440 --> 35:50.660
But he's alive?

35:50.760 --> 35:54.660
Do you hear what I'm saying?
He betrayed you.

35:54.760 --> 35:57.540
No. It's just love.

35:57.640 --> 36:00.740
He's your son.
He should be loyal. I'm loyal.

36:00.840 --> 36:05.641
Yes, you are. So rest up.
I need you ready to fight.

36:11.720 --> 36:13.290
What do you think?

36:16.480 --> 36:19.882
I think they've been studying us
for 200 years and we need to catch up.

36:22.720 --> 36:25.500
We're gonna give it a chance, right?

36:25.600 --> 36:28.410
Yeah. 'Course we are.

36:32.680 --> 36:35.206
I wish we were alone.

36:38.360 --> 36:39.860
Excuse me.

36:39.960 --> 36:41.644
The director's ready to see you.

36:44.720 --> 36:47.769
Yeah, er, sorry, I meant Tris, alone.

36:48.880 --> 36:50.620
We can't go together?

36:50.720 --> 36:53.700
Since you were the one who opened
the box which invited you here,

36:53.800 --> 36:55.802
the director would like
to thank you personally.

36:58.960 --> 37:01.531
I'll see you later.

37:07.440 --> 37:09.420
- Clothes.
- Thanks.

37:09.520 --> 37:10.760
This way.

37:35.360 --> 37:37.860
Go ahead. Put your wrist
under the scanner.

37:37.960 --> 37:40.531
Access granted.

37:49.280 --> 37:50.645
Pure.

38:53.800 --> 38:56.340
Just never imagined the world
to be this big.

38:56.440 --> 39:00.900
Ah. Chicago is just one of 50 major cities

39:01.000 --> 39:03.780
that used to exist
on this continent alone.

39:03.880 --> 39:08.681
Beyond that is oceans and more land
than you can imagine.

39:09.800 --> 39:11.370
It's all like this now?

39:12.760 --> 39:14.205
Yeah.

39:15.520 --> 39:17.820
All except for Providence.

39:17.920 --> 39:21.527
Which is why what we're doing here
is so important, Tris.

40:02.400 --> 40:03.640
Hello.

40:04.640 --> 40:06.340
You must be the director.

40:06.440 --> 40:08.340
Oh, please, call me David.

40:08.440 --> 40:11.180
It is a pleasure to finally meet you.

40:11.280 --> 40:13.282
You must have so many questions.

40:15.760 --> 40:18.780
I'm a bit overwhelmed.
I'm still processing it all.

40:18.880 --> 40:21.660
Oh, Tris, I know you.

40:21.760 --> 40:23.460
I watched you being born.

40:23.560 --> 40:27.201
I saw the love that your mother
and father had for you.

40:27.320 --> 40:29.740
I watched a little girl
have a happy childhood

40:29.840 --> 40:34.140
and grow into a courageous young woman
capable of making choices.

40:34.240 --> 40:38.460
Dauntless. Defying Jeanine.
Saving Chicago.

40:38.560 --> 40:40.580
To your people, you are Divergent.

40:40.680 --> 40:43.500
To the Council, you are a freak.

40:43.600 --> 40:46.968
To me, you are a miracle.

40:49.560 --> 40:52.940
David, are you aware of what's happening
in Chicago right now?

40:53.040 --> 40:54.900
Of course. Yes.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.526
The people at Erudite
really made a mess of things,

40:57.640 --> 40:59.324
but I don't want you to worry about that.

40:59.440 --> 41:04.140
Restoring order in Chicago
is as important to me as it is to you.

41:04.240 --> 41:07.100
It's the only way to save the Damaged.

41:07.200 --> 41:08.460
What is the Damaged?

41:08.560 --> 41:11.580
The genetic alterations
had disastrous consequences.

41:11.680 --> 41:13.220
Too brave, and you're cruel.

41:13.320 --> 41:15.180
Too peaceful, and you're passive.

41:15.280 --> 41:17.362
Too smart, and you lose compassion.

41:17.480 --> 41:18.700
Like your brother.

41:18.800 --> 41:20.220
Caleb's Damaged?

41:20.320 --> 41:22.004
Yes.

41:22.280 --> 41:23.660
For nearly 200 years,

41:23.760 --> 41:27.460
the greatest scientific minds
have lived here to test a theory.

41:27.560 --> 41:29.660
If we could rescue
genetically damaged people

41:29.760 --> 41:31.728
from the toxic environment in the Fringe

41:31.840 --> 41:33.740
and put them in a safe place,
like Chicago,

41:33.840 --> 41:35.604
then perhaps, over time,

41:35.720 --> 41:38.260
man's genetic material would heal itself,

41:38.360 --> 41:40.540
return to its original form.

41:40.640 --> 41:42.688
And I'm one of those people.

41:44.240 --> 41:45.571
You are the only one.

41:47.240 --> 41:48.660
That doesn't make any sense.

41:48.760 --> 41:51.780
I mean, uh, Four is Divergent.
There's lots of Divergents.

41:51.880 --> 41:53.540
Not Divergent, Tris. Pure.

41:53.640 --> 41:57.340
You are genetically Pure.
The rest are still Damaged.

41:57.440 --> 42:00.180
- Four?
- Damaged.

42:00.280 --> 42:03.180
Not as much as Caleb, but Damaged.

42:03.280 --> 42:05.660
If we can understand what made you,

42:05.760 --> 42:09.242
maybe we can use that knowledge
to help the Damaged.

42:11.880 --> 42:14.340
But what does this
have to do with Chicago?

42:14.440 --> 42:16.500
I answer to the Council.

42:16.600 --> 42:20.002
They're the ones who ultimately
determine our fate, yours and mine.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.860
I'm gonna bring you with me
to Providence to meet them.

42:23.960 --> 42:25.820
When they see that it's possible,

42:25.920 --> 42:30.180
that you were possible,
it will change everything.

42:30.280 --> 42:33.340
I understand it's hard
to take my word for it.

42:33.440 --> 42:36.762
But if you don't believe me,
believe your mother.

42:38.640 --> 42:39.860
My mother?

42:39.960 --> 42:42.300
Your mother Natalie
wasn't born in Chicago.

42:42.400 --> 42:46.041
She was born in the Fringe
and rescued by the Bureau.

42:47.880 --> 42:50.180
No, that's impossible.

42:50.280 --> 42:52.567
See for yourself.

43:04.240 --> 43:06.140
What are those?

43:06.240 --> 43:08.700
They're your mother's memory tabs.

43:08.800 --> 43:11.201
With them, you can watch
the world through her eyes.

43:17.960 --> 43:19.700
What do I do?

43:19.800 --> 43:21.723
Place one on each temple.

43:34.280 --> 43:36.487
Natalie! Come on!

43:36.600 --> 43:38.140
I'm not Natalie.

43:38.240 --> 43:40.208
We need to hide! Come on!

44:07.480 --> 44:08.720
They're coming! Run!

44:10.640 --> 44:12.580
The Fringers!

44:12.680 --> 44:15.331
Run!

44:32.680 --> 44:34.762
I'm not Natalie.

44:39.440 --> 44:41.681
Natalie, no!

44:42.920 --> 44:44.220
No!

44:44.320 --> 44:46.846
Bureau soldiers!

44:57.360 --> 44:58.580
Left! Flank left!

44:58.680 --> 45:00.900
Hit right, hit right, hit right!

45:01.000 --> 45:03.340
We're taking you to the Bureau.

45:03.440 --> 45:05.568
You're safe.

45:05.720 --> 45:07.927
You don't have to be afraid anymore.

45:14.720 --> 45:16.140
How many more did you save today?

45:16.240 --> 45:19.340
Not enough. We never get enough.

45:19.440 --> 45:21.780
Chicago has got to work, David.
It's the only hope for us.

45:21.880 --> 45:23.220
In the ashes of civilization,

45:23.320 --> 45:27.220
a small group of genetically
unmodified individuals

45:27.320 --> 45:31.140
established the Bureau
of Genetic Welfare here,

45:31.240 --> 45:33.380
at Chicago's O'Hare Airport.

45:33.480 --> 45:35.500
You're safe.

45:35.600 --> 45:38.540
Grand experiment to purify
the human genome.

45:38.640 --> 45:40.483
You're safe now.

45:45.520 --> 45:48.091
Your destiny begins today.

45:56.840 --> 46:00.740
Tris, in a moment of need,

46:00.840 --> 46:04.260
your mother did something
that no one had done before.

46:04.360 --> 46:07.420
She volunteered to leave
the safety of the Bureau

46:07.520 --> 46:09.300
to enter the experiment herself.

46:09.400 --> 46:14.460
She did this because she knew
the Damaged were worth saving.

46:14.560 --> 46:18.804
She believed in the experiment so much,
she was willing to be a part of it.

46:20.000 --> 46:24.369
If I can show the Council
your miracle can be replicated...

46:25.520 --> 46:28.340
then her life's work is complete.

46:28.440 --> 46:31.060
The Council will be forced
to look at every human being,

46:31.160 --> 46:34.721
no matter where they were born,
as worthy of life.

46:37.560 --> 46:39.140
Help me.

46:39.240 --> 46:42.380
You saved a city.

46:42.480 --> 46:45.006
Help me save the world.

46:52.680 --> 46:54.682
It was amazing.

46:54.800 --> 46:58.220
It was like I was her
and seeing it all through her eyes.

46:58.320 --> 47:00.004
Hmm...

47:01.000 --> 47:04.300
I still can't believe
my mom is from this place.

47:04.400 --> 47:06.607
Well, I can see why she left.

47:10.520 --> 47:11.851
Do you trust him?

47:12.840 --> 47:14.080
David?

47:15.560 --> 47:18.260
I trust her.

47:18.360 --> 47:20.010
Yeah.

47:53.320 --> 47:55.891
- Access denied.
- Tris.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.571
Access granted.

48:05.560 --> 48:07.767
There you are. You ready?

48:09.360 --> 48:11.328
Say hi to David for me.

48:20.200 --> 48:23.020
Tobias Eaton.

48:23.120 --> 48:25.340
You've been assigned to me.

48:25.440 --> 48:28.205
I'm Nita. Let's go.

48:32.280 --> 48:34.806
Why isn't everyone allowed upstairs?

48:34.920 --> 48:37.446
That would be
one of the Council's many rules.

48:37.560 --> 48:38.800
Certainly not mine.

48:38.920 --> 48:40.809
This separation, I don't like it.

48:40.920 --> 48:43.820
I agree. And in time,
that won't be necessary.

48:43.920 --> 48:48.020
But, Tris, I don't know who told you
that being different was a bad thing.

48:48.120 --> 48:50.691
Because I know it wasn't your mother.

48:59.400 --> 49:01.820
Oh, I know I can replicate this.

49:01.920 --> 49:03.843
All I need is time.

49:03.960 --> 49:05.580
Look, Regina, let's talk.

49:05.680 --> 49:09.140
You seem like a nice lady, but I'm
really not a desk job kind of guy.

49:09.240 --> 49:12.020
I get claustrophobic.
I need to be where the action is.

49:12.120 --> 49:16.740
The job of surveillance is to keep tabs
on the devolving situation in Chicago.

49:16.840 --> 49:19.100
This is where the action is.

49:19.200 --> 49:22.966
Hayes, this will be your pod.
Prior, you're next door.

49:25.960 --> 49:27.620
Resistance is growing.

49:27.720 --> 49:29.245
Evelyn is beginning to respond.

49:29.360 --> 49:31.980
Watch what's happening. File a report.

49:32.080 --> 49:35.300
Wait, what? Hold on.
I just escaped from Chicago.

49:35.400 --> 49:38.580
Now you're saying I gotta sit here
and watch it for the rest of my life?

49:38.680 --> 49:39.966
With Caleb?

49:40.080 --> 49:43.801
Perhaps you'd prefer
to be banished to the Fringe?

49:45.760 --> 49:49.300
Wow, this surveillance
technology's incredible.

49:49.400 --> 49:51.580
Whoever created this is a genius.

49:51.680 --> 49:54.340
Well, thank you. It was a labor of love.

49:54.440 --> 49:55.726
Ass kisser.

49:56.800 --> 49:58.689
Keep it up, Prior.

50:04.280 --> 50:06.851
And you, get to it.

50:37.520 --> 50:38.806
Ah!

51:00.800 --> 51:02.820
That's an awful lot of firepower.

51:02.920 --> 51:05.740
The Fringe is full of dangerous people.

51:05.840 --> 51:07.285
Put this on.

51:09.840 --> 51:11.763
- What are these?
- Personal drones.

51:11.880 --> 51:15.180
Expands your field of vision and
provides 3-D modeling of environments.

51:15.280 --> 51:16.860
Just like old times at Dauntless, huh?

51:16.960 --> 51:18.720
Except there's nothing old
about any of this.

51:30.120 --> 51:31.406
Here.

51:32.400 --> 51:33.660
Thanks.

51:33.760 --> 51:36.380
Activate the headgear.

51:36.480 --> 51:39.006
The left hand activates the drones.

51:55.960 --> 51:57.420
Does it do anything else?

51:57.520 --> 51:58.965
Not much.

52:06.960 --> 52:09.900
Use the drones to find the targets.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.765
It'll take you a while
to get the hang of it.

52:14.240 --> 52:15.765
Yeah.

52:17.760 --> 52:19.125
Okay.

52:39.360 --> 52:40.805
Identified.

53:05.640 --> 53:07.130
Target identified.

53:29.280 --> 53:31.282
I think I got the hang of it.

53:46.560 --> 53:47.800
Hmm.

53:48.800 --> 53:50.420
Can I ask you a question?

53:50.520 --> 53:52.140
Yeah. Of course.

53:52.240 --> 53:53.740
If my mother was born in the Fringe,

53:53.840 --> 53:55.380
then how did she end up in Chicago?

53:55.480 --> 53:58.340
I mean, you couldn't just send her
through the gate, right?

53:58.440 --> 54:01.728
No. No, the Council's always careful

54:01.840 --> 54:03.920
how they introduce any new element
to the experiment.

54:03.960 --> 54:07.700
Right. But when they need to,
they intervene.

54:07.800 --> 54:09.529
Yes.

54:09.640 --> 54:11.740
So why aren't they intervening now?

54:11.840 --> 54:14.366
Well, they will.
We just have to make our case.

54:16.760 --> 54:18.780
Can I still count on you to help me?

54:18.880 --> 54:22.009
Yes. Can I count on you?

54:27.000 --> 54:29.048
Jeanine never had a chance against you.

54:29.160 --> 54:32.642
The sooner we get finished,
the sooner we leave for Providence.

54:45.160 --> 54:48.740
The Allegiant? That's what
you're calling yourselves?

54:48.840 --> 54:51.700
Amity just doesn't seem
appropriate anymore.

54:51.800 --> 54:53.940
So what exactly are you allegiant to?

54:54.040 --> 54:55.300
The faction system?

54:55.400 --> 54:58.740
The factions kept Chicago
peaceful for a long time.

54:58.840 --> 55:01.860
Well, I wouldn't know about that
because I was forced out of my faction.

55:01.960 --> 55:04.620
I gave up my life, my child, everything.

55:04.720 --> 55:07.300
I understand your anger, Evelyn, I do.

55:07.400 --> 55:09.260
But the way forward...

55:09.360 --> 55:11.044
The way forward has already begun.

55:15.120 --> 55:18.340
I know I said I'd be alone,
but I'm not Candor.

55:18.440 --> 55:19.660
And I'm not Amity.

55:19.760 --> 55:23.500
So I will lie and I will fight
if I have to.

55:23.600 --> 55:25.204
You see these scars?

55:25.320 --> 55:28.210
I wasn't born Amity.

55:29.320 --> 55:32.927
And I can assure you, I'm not afraid
to fight for what I believe in.

55:34.840 --> 55:37.220
Seems like we're two peas in a pod.

55:37.320 --> 55:39.620
But it doesn't have to be this way.

55:39.720 --> 55:42.326
We can come to some sort of agreement.

55:45.000 --> 55:46.740
- Get back!
- Stop! Stop!

55:46.840 --> 55:48.524
- No, no!
- Get outta here!

56:00.440 --> 56:01.700
All right, Caleb.

56:01.800 --> 56:04.371
Keep me posted
if anything changes, all right?

56:11.840 --> 56:13.860
- Hi.
- Hey.

56:13.960 --> 56:17.060
Caleb said that some of the Dauntless
are lining up with Johanna.

56:17.160 --> 56:19.820
But the rest of Candor
is still solidly with Evelyn.

56:19.920 --> 56:22.620
Things are spiraling out of control.

56:22.720 --> 56:25.460
Has David said anything
about what he can do?

56:25.560 --> 56:28.325
Well, yeah, once we talk to the Council,
then the Bureau can step in.

56:30.600 --> 56:33.683
So it all hinges on the mysterious
Council, does it?

56:34.720 --> 56:38.220
- What if they say no?
- David is confident that they won't.

56:38.320 --> 56:40.926
David. Right.

56:43.040 --> 56:46.044
You know I found out
why I can't go upstairs?

56:47.440 --> 56:50.762
I'm Damaged and you're Pure.

56:51.920 --> 56:53.763
I know.

56:55.960 --> 56:57.769
You know. When were you gonna tell me?

56:58.760 --> 57:02.740
I don't know, I... I guess
I didn't think that it mattered.

57:02.840 --> 57:04.100
Why doesn't it matter?

57:04.200 --> 57:08.046
Because it doesn't make a difference
if you're Pure or if you're Damaged.

57:10.600 --> 57:12.250
You're still the same person to me.

57:18.360 --> 57:20.966
Look, I know that it's not perfect
by any means,

57:21.080 --> 57:23.420
but the Bureau saved my mother
from the Fringe.

57:23.520 --> 57:24.800
I wouldn't be here without them.

57:24.840 --> 57:28.322
What do you actually know
about what they do in the Fringe?

57:28.440 --> 57:29.860
You know what they tell you.

57:29.960 --> 57:31.689
- Yeah, but...
- I'm sorry.

57:31.800 --> 57:33.802
He needs you upstairs.

57:36.560 --> 57:39.131
He needs you upstairs.

57:58.480 --> 58:02.020
The people are nice. Weird, but nice.

58:02.120 --> 58:04.620
Yeah, they're definitely weird,
that's for sure.

58:04.720 --> 58:06.500
You kinda get used to it.

58:06.600 --> 58:08.700
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

58:08.800 --> 58:10.882
Next time you go to the Fringe, I want in.

58:11.960 --> 58:13.962
- You're not ready.
- I'm going.

58:20.280 --> 58:23.100
Tris, I am more than aware

58:23.200 --> 58:26.940
that the separation has been difficult
for you and Four.

58:27.040 --> 58:29.220
But I've watched you both
enough to know that

58:29.320 --> 58:32.051
I think the two of you
are going to work it out.

58:34.320 --> 58:35.560
We're fine.

58:38.520 --> 58:40.568
Everything's fine.

58:46.120 --> 58:48.646
Good. Let's get to work.

58:58.040 --> 58:59.260
Here we go!

58:59.360 --> 59:02.140
Fall in, people! Weather's clear,
we are green for a run.

59:02.240 --> 59:04.220
- Let's go!
- You, let's go, let's go!

59:04.320 --> 59:05.810
- Move! Let's go!
- Ready to go!

59:08.080 --> 59:09.320
Get your headset.

59:10.480 --> 59:11.720
Let's go.

59:20.240 --> 59:23.220
All right, here's the deal, listen up!

59:23.320 --> 59:26.928
This may be a humanitarian mission, but
the Lindale Settlement is very dangerous.

59:27.040 --> 59:29.805
- Everybody clear?
- Yes!

59:29.920 --> 59:32.900
- So what is the lifespan out here?
- 25, 30 years.

59:33.000 --> 59:36.340
If we get people early, they can live
up to 50 or 60 in the Bureau.

59:36.440 --> 59:40.700
Dauntless, if it was up to me,
you would not be out here.

59:40.800 --> 59:43.900
I know you think it was tough
in Chicago, but this is the Fringe.

59:44.000 --> 59:45.820
- Understood?
- Yes.

59:45.920 --> 59:47.700
Mission is to save
as many kids as possible.

59:47.800 --> 59:49.540
They've grown up in hellish conditions.

59:49.640 --> 59:53.700
But you have your weapons handy.
You stick to protocol.

59:53.800 --> 59:55.040
I don't wanna lose anyone.

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:13.482
Bullfrogs! Go! We're under! Go!

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:33.641
Go, go, go! We gotta move!

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:43.740
Drones!

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:45.285
Go!

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:49.522
- Help!
- Stop, stop, stop!

01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:51.300
Hey, hey, hey! Everything's okay.

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:53.100
I want my Dad! Please! No!

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:55.202
No! Dad!

01:00:57.400 --> 01:00:59.971
Everything's gonna be okay.
Just follow me.

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:51.291
Come on!

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:54.360
Run!

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:07.848
Searching target.

01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:12.560
This way.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.525
Target identified.

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:22.080
Go!

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:26.660
Stop!

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:29.380
- Stay away from us!
- Calm down. We're here to help.

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:31.600
- We don't need your help.
- I just wanna talk to you.

01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:33.580
- Not gonna lose my family.
- Hey!

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:35.000
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop!
- Don't!

01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:36.980
Get off him! Hey, get off my kid!

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:39.048
Get off him! Don't touch him!

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:53.060
What did you do?

01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:55.740
- It's okay, it's all right.
- I wanna see my dad.

01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:57.540
Four, let's go! Gotta move!

01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:58.900
It's all right, it's okay.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.540
Go! We gotta move, we gotta move.

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:02.460
Let's go, come on, come on!

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:04.020
- Romit!
- Don't.

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:06.407
What the hell is going on here?

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:10.686
Just do your job, Dauntless.

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:12.006
Let's go.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.240
Move!

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:17.805
Said, "Let's go!"

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:28.404
One man, two children,
down on the bridge! Go!

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:38.460
- We're here to help you!
- Go!

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:40.940
- Eyes down!
- Shut up! Look at me!

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:43.300
Hey, you, stop!

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:46.300
It's called soap. You should try it.

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:48.300
What's up, Stiff? You lost?

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:51.900
I wanted to see Four. David and I
are leaving for Providence.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.300
On a first name basis
with the director, huh?

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:56.846
- You work fast.
- Peter, can you leave her alone?

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:00.140
I don't need you to defend me.

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:02.242
Attention!

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:08.820
Get us ready for Providence.
We're on my ship within an hour.

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:10.180
- Yes, sir.
- Follow me.

01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:13.090
David, hey. I was wondering
if I could talk to you about my job.

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:15.180
You know, 'cause I'm not
really a typist and...

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:19.180
Or if you're busy today, I get it,
totally fine. We'll talk tomorrow.

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:20.691
Good idea.

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:32.245
I need to talk to you.

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:35.860
What is this, Nita?

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:38.580
- Vaccinations.
- What do you mean, vaccinations?

01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:41.180
We weren't given vaccinations.

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:42.884
Four.

01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:46.525
Look at this.

01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:49.780
Hey, what's your name?

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:51.769
My name?

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:58.140
Hey.

01:04:58.240 --> 01:04:59.969
I'm sorry about your dad.

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:01.525
My dad?

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:09.042
- All right, I'll see you back at base.
- Yep.

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:13.180
This is not a humanitarian mission.

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:15.362
We're not saving kids.
We're stealing them.

01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:18.940
This is what we do. Now you know.

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:22.060
David takes them out from here,
wipes their memories with the gas,

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:23.810
and raises them in the Bureau.

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:27.340
If you take away what they know,
then you take away who they are.

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:30.683
Yeah. I think that's the point.

01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:58.362
They were all unarmed.

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:03.850
I won't surrender to this.

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:06.660
Round up everyone who's left.

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:08.980
We take the fight to Evelyn.

01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:11.082
Yeah, loading up.

01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:17.765
We're moving.

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:24.380
Today we take Evelyn down.

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:25.980
Whatever it takes.

01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:27.809
Yeah!

01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:35.900
This is all real time.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.660
I mean, the surveillance technology
they have in place is extraordinary.

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:40.780
Caleb, can you get out of your head
for a second?

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:44.521
This is our home.
And there's gonna be a war.

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:49.100
Where are you going?

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:51.202
I'm gonna do something about it.

01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:04.700
Four! What are you trying to do?

01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:06.060
Access denied.

01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:08.660
I'm getting Tris. We're leaving.

01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:10.364
You can't go up there.

01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:14.020
- What do you think you're doing?
- Four.

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:15.820
- You cannot be in here.
- Four.

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:17.860
- It's not gonna work.
- Pure.

01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:20.042
Central elevator's been compromised.

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.460
- Hey. What?
- We're leaving. Right now.

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:47.980
What? I can't.

01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:51.260
Look, you don't understand yet,
but these people have been lying to you.

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:52.805
Lying? What are you talking about?

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:55.340
Look, whatever they've told you,
they have been...

01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:57.380
Put the guns down.

01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:00.020
He has been stealing
children from their families.

01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:02.460
- We're giving them a better life.
- By killing their parents?

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:04.688
It was an unfortunate accident, sir.

01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:10.180
One terrible accident doesn't mean
it was the wrong thing to do.

01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:12.380
Tris, this is not the place
that we thought it was.

01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:14.289
If you had enough to save one person,

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:17.620
and your choice was between
a healthy child or a sick old man,

01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:19.620
- who would you choose?
- I wouldn't choose.

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:22.180
Good. Now they're both dead.

01:08:22.279 --> 01:08:24.850
We have to go.

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:29.779
Tris, we're going back to Chicago.
We should never have left.

01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:32.220
- No, we have to wait.
- No, we've been waiting, okay?

01:08:32.319 --> 01:08:34.140
David is not the person
that you think he is.

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:35.640
Four, you know nothing about David.

01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:37.500
You've no idea
what we've been working on up here.

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:39.020
What have you been working on?

01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:41.009
Do you have any idea
what is going on out there?

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:42.340
Yes, of course I do.

01:08:42.439 --> 01:08:44.700
Why do you think we're going to meet
with the Council?

01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:46.020
Tris...

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:48.819
I want you to listen to me.

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:51.491
Tris.

01:08:54.279 --> 01:08:56.850
You're coming with me.

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:02.691
I have to go.

01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:19.645
You're making a mistake.

01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:53.082
You ready?

01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:56.324
Yeah.

01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:59.846
Autopilot engaged.

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:29.340
If you wanna go back to Chicago,
I'll take you.

01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:30.660
No, thanks.

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:34.003
You're gonna walk across the Fringe?
I don't think so.

01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:38.403
There's no rule saying
you can't go home, Four. Come on.

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:42.322
- Yeah.
- I'll come with you.

01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:54.446
All set!

01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:57.608
Take us to Chicago.

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:06.460
Look, I understand how you're feeling,
but what you're about to do

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:10.740
has ramifications for people
all over the world.

01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:14.845
If Four doesn't see that,
it's not your fault.

01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:39.220
David never wanted you to see
what you saw out on the Fringe.

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:40.700
He keeps tight control.

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:42.740
Nothing happens without his approval.

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:46.606
And his ship is the only one
that can fly through the camo wall.

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:50.300
Why are you telling me this?

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:53.404
We're not taking you to Chicago.

01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:56.771
Hold on!

01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:27.409
Welcome to Providence.

01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:41.340
I see why they don't want to share.

01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:44.011
Someday the whole world's
gonna look this beautiful.

01:13:58.520 --> 01:13:59.740
So, as you can see,

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:02.580
there are multiple genetic markers
supporting this conclusion.

01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:04.260
Standard personality tests.

01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:06.540
Behavioral evaluations. Stimulus response.

01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:09.220
She's passed them all with flying colors.

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:12.100
It all sounds great,
assuming it's the truth.

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:14.940
- Phillip...
- David has lied to us before.

01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:18.180
Haven't you, David?
I'd like to hear from the girl.

01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:20.940
Well, I don't know why.
She can't tell you anything I'm not.

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:22.451
Indulge us, David.

01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:27.500
This must all come as quite
a shock to you, Miss Prior,

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:29.580
finding out that you're Pure.

01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:31.540
Um...

01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:34.484
"Pure." I'm not even sure
what that's supposed to mean.

01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:37.180
But, yes, it is shocking to me.

01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:39.100
Shocking that the more
I learn about the past,

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:43.100
the more I feel like you're all making
the same mistakes over and over again.

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:44.820
Tris, this is not the way.

01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:46.729
Let her speak, David.

01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:50.540
What mistakes, Tris?

01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:53.100
Human beings cannot
be categorized in this way.

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:55.220
It doesn't work.

01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:57.700
Maybe it's time to start
embracing everyone

01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:01.620
instead of dividing them into groups,

01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:04.300
regardless of whether they're
Pure or they're Damaged.

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:05.920
That isn't what we're here to discuss.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.180
Well, it should be!

01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:11.580
Look, I know that all of this
is just an experiment to you,

01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:14.206
but these people in Chicago are real.

01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:17.220
And they are in a war right now
because of divisions that you created

01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:19.084
and you are doing nothing to help them.

01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:22.602
David has control over
the administration of Chicago.

01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:27.180
He's only here to extend his funding.

01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:28.884
Which we would be happy to do,

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.540
but if things are
as bad as she says, David,

01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:34.211
shouldn't you get
your house in order first?

01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:52.980
You said that you couldn't do anything.

01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:54.660
I am doing something.

01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:56.860
I'm bringing back the factions.

01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:59.088
What? Why?

01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:01.980
I hoped the Allegiant would take care
of the problem for me.

01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:05.260
The factions work, Tris.
They keep the peace.

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:07.362
They created you.

01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:11.851
I never should've trusted you.

01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:16.060
You want change with no sacrifice.

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:19.060
You want peace with no struggle.

01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:21.162
The world doesn't work like that.

01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:42.020
You okay?

01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:45.620
I'll be fine. The Bureau isn't far.

01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:47.006
I need to get to Chicago.

01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:49.980
Tell Evelyn she's got
a lot bigger problems than Johanna.

01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:51.491
Yeah.

01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:54.700
You'll need this
to get through the camo wall.

01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:57.540
We need your help, Tobias.

01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:00.166
You don't know what he's capable of.

01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:05.100
What about Tris?

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:08.980
As long as she stays
in the Bureau, she's safe.

01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:10.525
She's too valuable to him.

01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:15.764
I'll need a head start.

01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:18.900
So when David asks,

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.420
I want you to tell him
that I left you behind. Okay?

01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:23.740
Why?

01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:26.366
Because then Tris will know you're lying.

01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:43.609
There was an accident.

01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:45.220
There was turbulence.

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:46.900
Not more than any other storm, but...

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.082
Lightning, maybe.

01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:51.965
- We just went down.
- Where's Four?

01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:54.020
I don't know. I passed out.

01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:58.460
When I came to, everyone was dead.
Four left me behind.

01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:01.180
Okay, we search the settlements,
search the Fringe.

01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:02.611
Make sure he's not there.

01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:05.166
Don't worry, we'll find him. I promise.

01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:13.140
Four would never leave anyone
behind at the crash site.

01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:16.289
Yeah. He told me you would say that.

01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:20.648
Four's trying to make
his way back to Chicago.

01:19:58.280 --> 01:19:59.740
Peter.

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:01.540
Hello, David.

01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:03.460
I didn't think that you knew my name.

01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:06.803
I know all of the important people
from Chicago.

01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:10.500
Really?

01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:12.700
Well, if I'm so important,

01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:15.820
then why did you give me
such a terrible job?

01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:19.163
We all have to make sacrifices.

01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:25.322
I don't see you making any.

01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:29.965
Peter...

01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:35.486
I need help with something in Chicago.

01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:42.900
What's in it for me?

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.447
Well, if you do well,
you can have any job you want.

01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:50.845
Except mine.

01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:13.820
Do you know where Peter is?

01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:17.660
- Um... He's not in his pod?
- No.

01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:19.091
No, I don't know where he is.

01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:29.690
Is-is there something
that I can help you with?

01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:35.489
Can you find Four?

01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:39.660
You can't tell anyone.

01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:41.762
Okay, of course.

01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:47.291
Anything you need, Beatrice.

01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:09.082
Come on, Four, where are you?

01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:13.940
Evelyn.

01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:16.646
We found him outside the wall.

01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:20.404
Take it off.

01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:27.089
Where's my son?

01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:30.768
I don't know.

01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:34.643
Edgar told me what's out there,

01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:38.900
so you better start talking
or we'll be holding your trial now.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.020
No, you won't.

01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:43.700
Because I have something that you need.

01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:46.690
Really? And what's that?

01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:50.729
The way to win your war.

01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:54.660
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:22:54.760 --> 01:22:56.860
Any news?

01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:58.405
No.

01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:04.020
- I'm sorry.
- Tris...

01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:06.500
- Did you find him?
- Yes, I found Four.

01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:09.001
And there's something else
you're gonna wanna see, too.

01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:12.682
Okay, go.

01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:15.680
Over there!

01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:17.802
That's him! We got him!

01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:22.620
Four.

01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:26.008
Don't worry, he's fine.
Just keep watching.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.500
What is this place?

01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:32.204
You're gonna love it.

01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:06.060
What is it?

01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:08.527
Try it out. You'll see.

01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:12.684
Just don't try it on anyone you like.

01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:20.020
I was wondering when you'd have
the courage to face me.

01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:23.340
Three weeks you leave me here.

01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:25.220
I ran a faction!

01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:28.164
I protected our son from Jeanine's thugs.

01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:32.660
Protected him? Is that what you call it?

01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:34.922
Beating your own child!

01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:38.688
It made him who he is.

01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:55.369
Make sure he gets a good dose.

01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:36.128
Tobias... I'm just trying
to help you to be better.

01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:56.731
I'm s... I'm s... I'm sorry, but...

01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:01.562
Who are you?

01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:04.366
Huh...

01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:09.820
Just imagine if you released
this on the Allegiant.

01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:13.970
Not even Johanna will remember a time
that you weren't in charge.

01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:16.620
Who exactly told you about this?

01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:19.820
You have a very powerful friend
on the outside

01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:22.700
if you choose to engage
instead of prepare.

01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:25.326
- Does this friend have a name?
- David.

01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:30.820
- David?
- You can tell my friend

01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:33.685
I'm not gonna use that thing
unless it's a last resort.

01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:37.700
Why would David support Evelyn?

01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:40.121
Doesn't make any sense.

01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:49.660
Are you okay? I was worried about you.

01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:51.580
Evelyn, you need to make peace
with the Allegiant.

01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:53.580
No. Johanna made her choice.

01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:57.540
I never wanted this war,
but I will end it, I promise you.

01:26:57.640 --> 01:27:00.291
You have no idea what you're up against.
Johanna is not the issue.

01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:05.167
Look, I know you're angry at me
and I understand that.

01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:09.888
I'm just... I never meant...

01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:14.123
This is hard for me, too.
I don't wanna have to keep you in here.

01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:16.288
Then let me out.

01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:21.500
I can't. I have responsibilities.

01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:25.340
One day you'll understand that,
but right now I need you to stay here.

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:28.569
I'm gonna finish this. One way or another.

01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:31.126
How are you gonna finish this?

01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:33.447
Hey, don't worry.
You won't have to be here for long.

01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:36.780
What... What are you talking about?

01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:38.660
Well, Evelyn's deciding now.

01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:42.401
If she uses the memory serum,
Chicago might forget its own name.

01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:34.660
We have to go.

01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:37.081
Get Christina and meet me outside.

01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:39.480
Where are we going?

01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:41.926
Home.

01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:59.331
Access granted.

01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:12.580
How's it going in Chicago?

01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:15.411
Making sure it's safe from Evelyn
and the Factionless?

01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:19.740
Tris, you need to forget about Chicago.

01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:21.100
You know, it's really funny, David.

01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:24.000
You've been watching me for years
and you don't know anything about me.

01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:27.500
You're wiping the memories
of everyone in Chicago, aren't you?

01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:28.860
All right, uh, no...

01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:30.420
You were never supporting the Allegiant.

01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:34.140
These people treated you terribly.
They killed your parents!

01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:35.460
Four is there!

01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:37.940
Four. Yes, yes, Four is there.

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:40.441
But he's Damaged,
just like the rest of them.

01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:43.420
Where are you going?

01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:45.420
I'm taking your ship
and I'm not coming back.

01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:47.700
You can't fly.

01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:49.040
Watch me.

01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:02.686
Autopilot engaged.

01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:11.484
Tris Prior is stealing my craft.
Bring her back.

01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:18.766
Hurry.

01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:21.300
Christina.

01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:23.460
- These are for you and Tris.
- How'd you know we were leaving?

01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:26.660
You're not the only ones who hate David.

01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:28.180
- Okay, come on.
- Thank you.

01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:30.940
- Hold it!
- Get in, get in.

01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:32.940
Hands to yourself or I throw you out.

01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:35.611
Let's go rescue Four.

01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:56.326
Looks like three ships are following us.

01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:03.940
- Plasmacraft engaged.
- Surround it.

01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:05.260
Give her a nudge towards the ground.

01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:07.488
The autopilot will bring her down safely.

01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:12.760
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:17.940
What are they trying to do?

01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:19.929
They're trying to bring us
in for a landing.

01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:24.700
I'm going manual.

01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:26.131
Tris!

01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:31.140
Pull up! Pull up!

01:31:31.240 --> 01:31:34.060
Trying. I'm trying!

01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:35.491
Altitude.

01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:52.726
I got it.

01:31:57.040 --> 01:31:58.940
Your orders, sir?

01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:00.700
Shoot her down.

01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:02.700
Before she reaches the camo wall.

01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:04.404
You can't follow her through.

01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:12.529
We're dead.

01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:16.000
We're gonna die, we're gonna die,
we're gonna die!

01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:21.171
Hold on!

01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:28.929
It's gonna be close.

01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:55.300
There has to be a way to shut off the gas.

01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:57.880
Look at the ventilation system.
It's all over the city.

01:32:58.960 --> 01:33:00.340
Down there.

01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:01.726
Johanna.

01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:04.802
We got here just in time.

01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:13.850
It's time, Evelyn.

01:33:16.160 --> 01:33:19.050
You said the gas was a last resort.

01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:22.051
Well...

01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:26.249
How do you think
your trial is going to end?

01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:43.140
Let me know the second
the serum is released.

01:33:43.240 --> 01:33:45.140
You got it. Good luck.

01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:46.685
Thank you.

01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:56.940
How do these drones work?

01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:58.485
Turn your headgear on.

01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:03.580
And?

01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:05.220
Watch and learn.

01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:07.620
Stop right there! Drop your weapons!

01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:10.530
Hey. Hey, whoa, what are you doing?

01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:11.846
Put me down!

01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:24.284
All right, this one's all you.

01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:27.562
- Easy!
- Sorry.

01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:29.060
Stay where you are!

01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:30.810
That's my girl.

01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:48.491
Recon!

01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:16.527
Screw this! I'm outta here.

01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:33.847
What the hell is that?

01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:20.320
Hey.

01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:28.721
Hey... I'm sorry.

01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:31.700
I never should have trusted him.

01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:34.485
You were doing what you thought was right.

01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:41.241
I love you.

01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:52.803
We should find Evelyn.

01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:55.810
Come on.

01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:00.851
Serum status: Ready.

01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:04.567
Now, if you press that button...

01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:09.044
We're completely safe inside the vault.

01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:16.487
And no one else will ever know
what happened to them.

01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:22.322
Your choice.

01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:37.362
Initialize serum vaporization.

01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:46.860
Guys!

01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:49.060
Guys! They just initiated the serum.

01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:51.420
Did you find a way to shut it off?

01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:53.780
Come on.

01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:55.180
Not yet.

01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:57.282
This way.

01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:17.660
It's locked.

01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:19.060
I'll see if I can get in
from the control room.

01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:21.420
Evelyn, you have to stop this right now.

01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:23.124
I...

01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:27.500
I didn't wanna do this, but I have to.

01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:29.620
I'm the only one who knows
how to save Chicago.

01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:33.691
I was right to close the gate,
but no one listened. No one!

01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:35.564
Not even you.

01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:38.820
The Allegiant brought this on themselves.

01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:42.060
Evelyn, that serum is not just gonna
wipe the memories of the Allegiant.

01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:43.620
It's gonna do it to the whole city.

01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:45.460
What?

01:38:45.560 --> 01:38:47.403
Whatever they told you was a lie.

01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:50.129
Oh, God...

01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:54.300
- Oh, God.
- Evelyn...

01:38:54.400 --> 01:38:56.801
I wanna stand by your side.

01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:02.241
But what you do to the city, you do to me.

01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:07.527
Mom...

01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:11.380
Tobias...

01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:13.687
I won't know who you are.

01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:21.120
Don't do it.

01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:26.603
Please.

01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:29.051
Go.

01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:36.723
No!

01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:44.087
That's why you pick a guy like me
for a job like this.

01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:47.130
I hope you're watching, David!

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.100
Christina, have you
figured out the door yet?

01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:58.020
Once it's locked from the inside,
the door won't open.

01:39:58.120 --> 01:39:59.531
Well, keep trying.

01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:03.851
Begin serum release.

01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:38.646
Don't breathe it in!
Don't breathe in the gas!

01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:50.860
Caleb, we're running out of options here!

01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:52.180
Hold on.

01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:53.820
I think I found something.

01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:55.500
There's a choke point where the vapor
gets pumped out.

01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:57.807
Cut their com line to the ship.

01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:03.220
Caleb? Caleb!

01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:06.085
Tris? Tris, can you hear me?

01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:10.126
Caleb!

01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:14.606
I'm going in.

01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:33.524
What? Huh?

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:36.860
Oh, shit!

01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:38.200
What the...

01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:43.500
- Make it stop!
- It's locked!

01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:45.568
- Open the door!
- Open the door!

01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:48.804
Peter, open the door!

01:41:57.720 --> 01:41:59.131
I will find you, Peter.

01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:09.140
Tobias.

01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:10.480
You're okay.

01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:13.100
Oh, shit!

01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:14.964
- Can you stop it?
- No.

01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:31.920
Caleb, do you hear me?

01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:33.610
Caleb, where are you?

01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:41.171
Caleb Prior!

01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:47.920
Sorry.

01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:02.060
Tris, look at this, it's really smart.

01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:03.920
So they ran the piping
through the air ducts.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.082
Caleb, focus. Just tell me where it is.

01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:08.820
It's right here. There's an isolation
valve that controls the flow of the air.

01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:10.460
But I don't know
how you're gonna get down there.

01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:12.244
I do. Four!

01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:19.731
Go.

01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:31.651
Tris, it's at the end of the hall.

01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:46.126
Close the door.

01:43:56.440 --> 01:43:58.980
Tris? I control everything.

01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:01.300
I can even seal the room
you're in right now.

01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:03.140
Just stop fighting.

01:44:03.240 --> 01:44:05.447
There's another way. Down the stairs.

01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:12.060
This is foolish. Just stop.

01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:13.420
I made you.

01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:18.020
You might as well be my child,
which is what you're acting like.

01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:20.700
A spoiled child.

01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:23.320
Tris, at the end of the hall,
there's another way up the ladder.

01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:29.362
It's over, Tris.

01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:34.811
Searching target.

01:44:36.280 --> 01:44:37.520
Searching target.

01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:40.010
Searching target.

01:44:43.640 --> 01:44:45.642
Target identified.

01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:50.202
There you are.

01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:00.286
You're right, David. It is over.

01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:11.084
No!

01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:16.460
Serum release halted.

01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:19.530
How's that for Damaged?

01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:37.330
Clear.

01:45:40.040 --> 01:45:42.202
It's clear.

01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:48.402
Clear.

01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:50.811
Clear.

01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:06.049
We did it.

01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:09.287
It's what you do for family.

01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:21.500
Caleb, there's one more thing
I want you to do.

01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:24.126
I wanna send a message to David.

01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:40.010
My name is Tris Prior.

01:46:40.120 --> 01:46:43.060
And I'm here to reveal the truth.

01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:45.540
There are others who exist on this planet.

01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:47.500
They do not view us as equals.

01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:49.940
They call themselves the Pure

01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:53.020
and they call us the Damaged.

01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:56.060
They created a wall
to divide us from their world

01:46:56.160 --> 01:46:59.050
and factions to divide us from each other.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:04.482
Hello? Come on!

01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:08.460
You think you can ditch me like this?

01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:10.860
Get me to do your dirty work

01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:14.860
and then just wipe me away
like the rest of 'em?

01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:16.900
We had a deal, pal!

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:20.100
We were their experiment
and it almost destroyed us.

01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:23.886
I set the autopilot right
for our friend's neighborhood.

01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:28.522
Along with a little surprise for when
it goes through the camouflage wall.

01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:38.220
They tried to make us forget
who we are and where we're from,

01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:40.288
but they did not succeed.

01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:44.700
So here we stand. Together.

01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:47.740
Not as five factions, but as one city.

01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:50.650
And we're gonna tear down their wall.

01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:01.540
I want the penthouse!

01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:04.644
Yeah! That's right!

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:13.403
Or a room in that really cool
upstairs area.

01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:19.940
Okay, look...

01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:23.380
I'll even take my old bunk back.

01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:27.500
Just come on and open the damn door!

01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:30.126
Please!

01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:48.100
You've seen us.

01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:50.726
And now, we see you.

01:48:56.920 --> 01:49:00.020
To those of you beyond the wall,
hear me loud and clear,

01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:02.122
because I know you're listening.

01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:05.940
Chicago is not your experiment.

01:49:06.040 --> 01:49:07.900
It is our home.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.571
And it always will be.
