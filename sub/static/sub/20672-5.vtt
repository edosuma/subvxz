00:06.107 --> 00:08.242
Hello, everyone.
What have I missed?

00:08.276 --> 00:10.378
(male #1)
There's a bunch of samurai
and snakes stealing

00:10.411 --> 00:12.246
every piece of metal
they can find.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.115
(Lloyd)
Master Wu still hasn't
recovered

00:14.148 --> 00:15.516
from his battle with the Krux.

00:15.549 --> 00:18.152
Snakes are attacking
Monster Amusement Park.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.357
[dramatic music]

00:58.459 --> 01:00.661
[all clamoring]

01:03.397 --> 01:05.633
- What are those things?
- Wha-what do they want?

01:05.666 --> 01:07.601
Not the mascots.

01:10.738 --> 01:12.706
[monster laugh]

01:12.740 --> 01:14.442
Not cool.

01:15.343 --> 01:16.610
So lame.

01:16.644 --> 01:18.346
Not cool.

01:20.314 --> 01:23.584
- Aah! So lame!
- Not cool!

01:23.617 --> 01:25.653
[growling]

01:29.323 --> 01:33.627
Aah, I just love the smell
of screams in the evening.

01:36.897 --> 01:40.301
Ugh! Mega Monster
Amusement Park? Really?

01:40.334 --> 01:43.671
Don't these guys have any sense
of decency? Where does it end?

01:43.704 --> 01:45.406
It ends here, and now.

01:45.439 --> 01:49.743
P.I.X.A.L, give me
a danger analysis. P.I.X.A.L?

01:49.777 --> 01:53.381
P.I.X.A.L, respond.
I need a danger analysis.

01:53.414 --> 01:57.151
[gasps]
Here's one, the rollercoaster.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.255
[screaming]

02:01.289 --> 02:03.224
Zane, Cole, get up there, fast!

02:03.257 --> 02:05.393
- Right.
- Got it.

02:07.261 --> 02:08.529
The rest of you, spread out.

02:08.562 --> 02:11.599
Time to make this place
a snake-free zone.

02:11.632 --> 02:12.900
We can do this, team.

02:12.933 --> 02:15.703
Wow. Listen to Lloyd
taking charge.

02:15.736 --> 02:19.240
I like it. He's starting to get
this master thing down.

02:19.273 --> 02:22.376
[screaming]

02:44.732 --> 02:46.934
You don't have a ticket!
You don't have a ticket.

02:46.967 --> 02:48.602
And you! And you!

02:48.636 --> 02:52.473
Which one of you slimeballs
stole my Samurai X suit?

02:52.506 --> 02:53.941
Was it you?

02:53.974 --> 02:55.909
Or you?

02:55.943 --> 02:58.679
- Or you?
- Aah!

02:58.712 --> 03:01.249
We're gonna go
round and round and round

03:01.282 --> 03:03.317
until I get some answers.

03:03.351 --> 03:05.786
[screaming]

03:08.756 --> 03:10.324
Ha ha!

03:11.659 --> 03:13.794
Whoa!

03:13.827 --> 03:15.696
Uh, fake ghost.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.998
Ha ha. I knew that. Ahem!

03:18.031 --> 03:20.601
- So lame.
- Not cool.

03:21.402 --> 03:23.271
Whoa! Haiyah!

03:24.438 --> 03:26.474
[instrumental music]

03:29.009 --> 03:31.479
Huh? That symbol.

03:31.512 --> 03:32.780
'It's..'

03:34.915 --> 03:36.317
Huh?

03:39.887 --> 03:42.256
A-Squadron, hold off the ninja.

03:42.290 --> 03:44.392
The rest of you,
keep bringing the metal.

03:44.425 --> 03:46.560
We must multi-task.

03:46.594 --> 03:48.529
[growling]

03:49.697 --> 03:51.765
[grunts]
You mind if I borrow these?

03:53.467 --> 03:55.369
- What's your name?
- I'm Johnny.

03:56.704 --> 03:57.838
pop

04:02.943 --> 04:04.445
Nice to meet you, Johnny.

04:04.478 --> 04:06.814
You too, Lloyd.

04:06.847 --> 04:09.249
Ninjago!

04:10.784 --> 04:14.488
Ninja, sound up!
Is everyone okay?

04:14.522 --> 04:17.891
[sighs]
So far, barely!

04:17.925 --> 04:21.061
[groans]
If you mean, okay,
there sure are a lot of them

04:21.094 --> 04:23.397
then, yeah, I'm okay.

04:24.832 --> 04:27.301
For the record,
this is the least amusing

04:27.335 --> 04:30.338
amusement park
I've ever been to.

04:30.371 --> 04:32.072
These snakes are behaving
curiously.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.041
You think?
'Cause boosting scrap metal

04:34.074 --> 04:36.677
doesn't seem like, you know,
normal snake behavior.

04:36.710 --> 04:40.013
Neither does reforming
into unstoppable samurai things.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.782
I mean, strategically.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.784
They appear more interested
in keepin' us away

04:43.817 --> 04:45.853
from their compatriots
that are stealing metal

04:45.886 --> 04:47.855
than they are
in actually defeatin' us.

04:47.888 --> 04:51.859
Well, they finally have to deal
with us at full strength, and..

04:51.892 --> 04:53.427
Hang on..

04:53.461 --> 04:56.397
- H-has anyone seen Jay?
- No.

04:56.430 --> 04:59.433
Now that you mention it, he
wasn't with us when we arrived.

04:59.467 --> 05:00.868
You know, just once,
it would be nice

05:00.901 --> 05:02.970
to go into battle
with a full team.

05:03.003 --> 05:04.805
Well, don't tell us, tell Jay!

05:04.838 --> 05:06.607
He's the one
who took off wherever

05:06.640 --> 05:08.409
without saying a word to us.

05:08.442 --> 05:10.344
(Nya)
I'm sure he had a good reason.

05:10.378 --> 05:12.480
(Kai)
Well, I'm glad you're sure.

05:16.850 --> 05:19.319
[growling]

05:20.921 --> 05:24.425
Yes! Keep it coming.

05:24.458 --> 05:27.127
Can't disappoint
Commander Machia.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.664
No, not the Hands Of Time's pet.

05:30.698 --> 05:32.466
[engine revving]

05:32.500 --> 05:35.869
I reserve the right
to refuse service to you!

05:40.073 --> 05:43.043
I don't think they saw your sign
in the front window, honey.

05:43.076 --> 05:47.648
Take your fangs off my parents,
you darn dirty snakes!

05:48.048 --> 05:49.883
Hyah!

05:51.885 --> 05:54.087
Mom, dad, are you okay?

05:54.121 --> 05:58.426
Oh, well, I am now very late
for my quilting circle.

06:03.631 --> 06:05.599
The ninja mustn't interfere.

06:05.633 --> 06:07.701
Get over there
and take him down.

06:09.903 --> 06:12.005
Whoa! Whoa! Oh, oh!

06:12.039 --> 06:14.975
Oh, gee!
What's happening?

06:15.008 --> 06:19.513
These fellas came out of nowhere
and started grabbing things.

06:19.547 --> 06:21.048
Yeah, they do that.

06:21.081 --> 06:23.617
Oh, now that's rude!

06:24.985 --> 06:27.788
Don't worry, I won't let
anything happen to you.

06:27.821 --> 06:30.658
I'm going to get you both
out of here on my bike.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.394
Argh!

06:39.633 --> 06:42.970
Everything is moving along
according to plan, brother.

06:43.003 --> 06:47.641
The metal is coming in
by the snake load, and our, ahem

06:47.675 --> 06:50.511
laborers are already
hard at work

06:50.544 --> 06:52.212
on their various projects.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.915
- How's it going with Borg?
- Poorly.

06:54.948 --> 06:58.519
He's barely made any progress
on the apparatus.

06:58.552 --> 06:59.953
And I thought
you were supposed to be

06:59.987 --> 07:02.556
this era's greatest inventor.

07:02.590 --> 07:06.627
How can I create anything with
this substandard materials?

07:06.660 --> 07:09.196
Chunks of metal, tiny scraps.

07:09.229 --> 07:12.666
And these!
These aren't even gold trophies!

07:12.700 --> 07:16.604
And don't get me started
on these ancient tools!

07:16.637 --> 07:18.672
I'm sorry! I can't do it!

07:18.706 --> 07:22.976
Excuses. In my day, we built
with anything at hand.

07:23.010 --> 07:25.479
Craftsmanship meant something.

07:25.513 --> 07:28.916
I suspect you can
build the apparatus

07:28.949 --> 07:30.784
you just don't want to.

07:30.818 --> 07:34.955
Okay, yes!
And you can't make me.

07:34.988 --> 07:38.091
Hmm. Don't be so sure.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.727
Ah, Commander Machia.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.129
- I see you received my message.
- I did.

07:42.162 --> 07:45.699
What was so important that you
pulled me from the battlefield?

07:45.733 --> 07:47.568
I'm reluctant to leave details

07:47.601 --> 07:49.903
up to those fools,
Blunck and Raggmunk.

07:49.937 --> 07:54.241
It appears, one of our workers
is reluctant to do his job.

07:54.274 --> 07:57.210
I was hoping you could
motivate him.

07:57.244 --> 07:59.547
With pleasure.

08:01.114 --> 08:05.052
(Borg)
'Uh, no. No, no, no, wait.
I, I'll do whatever you want!'

08:05.085 --> 08:08.121
Yes, I know you will.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.724
[Borg screaming]

08:10.758 --> 08:13.226
So, it is so, so tickly.

08:13.260 --> 08:15.262
So, so terribly awful!

08:15.295 --> 08:19.567
I like her. She's mean.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.102
Sounds like someone has a crush.

08:22.135 --> 08:23.704
I do not!

08:31.579 --> 08:34.782
I mean, she's cute, sure.
On the surface.

08:34.815 --> 08:41.521
But deep down,
she's a pile of snakes!

08:59.740 --> 09:03.043
It has arrived, brother.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.646
Did you not hear me?

09:05.679 --> 09:07.915
The next Time Blade has arrived.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.819
Which means, we should be out
looking for it.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.654
And yet
you play children's games?

09:13.687 --> 09:16.657
I am trying to discern
the blade's location

09:16.690 --> 09:17.925
on my smart watch!

09:17.958 --> 09:20.360
However, if you keep
distracting me..

09:20.393 --> 09:22.162
Fine, fine.

09:22.195 --> 09:25.966
As usual, you have far too much
faith in technology.

09:25.999 --> 09:28.936
Doesn't seem like
a very smart watch to me.

09:28.969 --> 09:34.742
Uh, actually, the Borg watch is
the smartest smart watch ever.

09:34.775 --> 09:37.878
There's a heart-rate monitor,
a GPS unit

09:37.911 --> 09:42.616
and even a temporal anomaly
locater, hmm?

09:42.650 --> 09:45.819
The Time Blade
is at latitude 34 degrees

09:45.853 --> 09:48.856
longitude 28 degrees.

09:51.191 --> 09:52.893
Very well.

09:52.926 --> 09:56.096
It appears
technology has its uses.

09:56.129 --> 09:58.666
Maybe. Sometimes.

09:58.699 --> 10:01.368
Hmm. The Eastern Sea of Sand.

10:01.401 --> 10:04.337
Given the blade's location,
our troops at both the scrapyard

10:04.371 --> 10:08.742
and Mega Monster Amusement Park
can get to it before we can.

10:08.776 --> 10:11.779
[sighs]
I'm afraid Blunck and Raggmunk

10:11.812 --> 10:13.881
are in the best position
to retrieve it.

10:13.914 --> 10:16.917
The blade is now
our top priority.

10:16.950 --> 10:20.153
Commander Machia, make it so.

10:20.187 --> 10:23.757
Blunck, Raggmunk, hear me..

10:26.159 --> 10:29.362
Message received,
Commander Machia.

10:29.396 --> 10:32.165
Vermillion Warriors,
we're leaving.

10:32.199 --> 10:34.134
Take the builder, now.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.870
[chuckles]
Vermillion Warriors, really?

10:36.904 --> 10:39.406
That's what they're called?
Ugh!

10:39.439 --> 10:42.042
Hey, let go of me! Aah!

10:42.943 --> 10:45.012
- Watch it!
- Aah!

10:47.948 --> 10:49.649
thud

10:52.485 --> 10:53.954
Take her!

10:53.987 --> 10:55.889
She may be a builder also.

10:55.923 --> 10:59.993
Oh, wait, wait! I don't like to
go anywhere without my purse!

11:00.027 --> 11:01.428
[screaming]

11:01.461 --> 11:03.130
Edna!

11:04.431 --> 11:07.134
Put me down! Aah!

11:09.136 --> 11:10.203
thud

11:10.237 --> 11:12.072
[grunts]

11:12.105 --> 11:13.373
(Edna)
'Help!'

11:13.406 --> 11:14.808
Mom!

11:14.842 --> 11:17.310
Hang on, I'm coming!

11:17.344 --> 11:20.213
Gotta form my dragon!

11:20.247 --> 11:23.917
Come on, Jay, you can do this,
you can do this.

11:23.951 --> 11:26.086
Oh, I can't do this,
I'm too freaked!

11:26.119 --> 11:30.423
(Edna)
'There's meat loaf
in the freezer, honey!'

11:30.457 --> 11:32.192
[instrumental music]

11:42.235 --> 11:44.304
clank

11:44.337 --> 11:45.839
Is everyone alright?

11:45.873 --> 11:49.209
Yeah, I think so. What happened?

11:49.242 --> 11:52.079
They had us, and then..

11:52.112 --> 11:54.948
And then it was like
when the Time Blade showed up

11:54.982 --> 12:00.287
except, instead of time speeding
forward, it slowed down.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.488
Way down.

12:01.521 --> 12:04.224
Another Time Blade
must have arrived.

12:04.257 --> 12:06.493
And somehow,
the snakes knew it.

12:06.526 --> 12:09.062
Thirty-four. Twenty-eight.

12:09.096 --> 12:12.132
Uh-oh, I think Zane
got knocked offline again.

12:12.165 --> 12:14.201
He's babbling numbers.

12:14.234 --> 12:17.104
No, that's latitude
and longitude.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.506
Nya,
upgrading my temporal scanner

12:19.539 --> 12:21.274
during my reboot
was a good idea.

12:21.308 --> 12:24.177
Well, I saw
the new Borg watch had one.

12:24.211 --> 12:27.214
The Time Blade is in
the Eastern Sea of Sand.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.382
That must be where
the snakes went.

12:29.416 --> 12:32.185
We can't let them
get there first. Come on!

12:33.353 --> 12:35.889
vroom vroom

12:35.923 --> 12:37.524
Ooh, I just promised

12:37.557 --> 12:39.259
nothing was going to hurt
you guys.

12:39.292 --> 12:40.928
And now they've taken mom.

12:40.961 --> 12:42.996
It's going to be fine.

12:43.030 --> 12:45.966
I'm sure you'll come up
with a way to save the day.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.901
Yeah? How can you be sure?

12:47.935 --> 12:49.302
Well, because you have
every other time

12:49.336 --> 12:52.505
the forces of evil
have descended on this place.

12:52.539 --> 12:56.109
Just remember what we say
in the scrap metal business.

12:56.143 --> 12:58.411
Keep your emotions
under control

12:58.445 --> 13:01.014
and focus on the problem
at hand.

13:01.048 --> 13:02.415
Do you actually say that?

13:02.449 --> 13:05.953
Oh, it's a surprisingly harsh
business, son.

13:05.986 --> 13:10.390
Important thing is,
we raised you to never give up.

13:10.423 --> 13:11.859
[sighs]

13:11.892 --> 13:14.394
You're right.
I'm going after mom.

13:14.427 --> 13:19.432
- That's the spirit, son.
- Where's the nearest bus stop?

13:19.466 --> 13:21.334
[clears throat]
Hold on.

13:21.368 --> 13:24.071
I have something here
that might be useful.

13:24.104 --> 13:26.573
Something that doesn't require
a bus pass.

13:26.606 --> 13:30.477
Now, normally, I don't believe
in giving birthday gifts early

13:30.510 --> 13:32.612
but your mother is in danger

13:32.645 --> 13:34.982
so I'm going
to make an exception.

13:36.583 --> 13:39.452
Like it? I built it myself.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.121
Uh..

13:43.356 --> 13:45.926
I've got some ideas
for a few modifications

13:45.959 --> 13:47.327
i-if that's okay.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.963
Only if you let me help.

13:51.231 --> 13:52.966
[dramatic music]

13:57.604 --> 13:59.306
thud

14:00.640 --> 14:05.212
- Yoo-hoo!
- Ha ha ha!

14:06.346 --> 14:09.316
Lovely morning for a ride
in the desert.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.451
It's too blasting hot!

14:11.484 --> 14:14.087
Yes, but it's a dry heat!

14:14.121 --> 14:18.025
You see!
This is why I wanted my purse.

14:18.058 --> 14:22.862
I keep a bottle of water in it!
Hydration is important!

14:24.397 --> 14:26.233
vroom

14:28.068 --> 14:31.204
I don't see the Time Blade,
but they have Jay's mom!

14:31.238 --> 14:33.640
That must be why
Jay left so suddenly.

14:33.673 --> 14:36.076
But, uh, where is he?

14:36.109 --> 14:37.577
We have to worry
about that later.

14:37.610 --> 14:40.313
There's still a chance
to get to the Time Blade first.

14:40.347 --> 14:42.049
Split up!

14:47.487 --> 14:50.290
Come on, come on! Aah!

14:51.691 --> 14:53.293
Aa-a-ah!

14:55.295 --> 14:57.064
Whoa-a-a!

14:57.597 --> 14:59.066
Yes!

15:04.371 --> 15:07.274
[gunfire]

15:07.307 --> 15:09.042
[explosion]

15:12.045 --> 15:13.480
[screaming]

15:18.018 --> 15:20.187
We're approaching
the Time Blade!

15:21.521 --> 15:23.456
(Nya)
'Incoming!'

15:26.359 --> 15:28.295
[Nya groans]

15:28.328 --> 15:29.929
[horn blaring]

15:32.332 --> 15:36.303
Oh, Nya,
so nice to see you, dearie!

15:36.336 --> 15:38.205
[evil laughter]

15:43.276 --> 15:46.013
Ninja, I have just the thing
for you!

15:46.046 --> 15:48.548
Snakey, snake, snake!

15:55.188 --> 15:59.226
(Cole)
'Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!'

15:59.259 --> 16:00.493
thud

16:01.561 --> 16:04.097
[screaming]

16:04.731 --> 16:06.599
thud

16:06.633 --> 16:09.069
[hissing]

16:09.102 --> 16:11.004
(Lloyd)
'Whoa!'

16:15.342 --> 16:17.410
[laughing]

16:18.545 --> 16:22.082
The Time Blade! Yes!
Come to Raggmunk!

16:22.115 --> 16:25.485
Hey! Why should you
get the credit? Mine!

16:25.518 --> 16:27.254
The Time Blade!

16:30.590 --> 16:32.259
No!

16:34.194 --> 16:36.563
Yes! I got it!

16:36.596 --> 16:39.266
Ooh! It feels better than
I could ever have imagined.

16:39.299 --> 16:42.402
Ooh! Can I hold it?
L-let me hold it!

16:43.803 --> 16:46.239
What's the rush, little fools?

16:46.273 --> 16:48.007
Hyah!

16:52.679 --> 16:53.680
Nice shot.

16:53.713 --> 16:55.248
It's my first time.

16:55.282 --> 16:58.551
Yes! We still have a chance!
Move! Move! Move!

16:59.819 --> 17:01.588
[grunting]

17:01.621 --> 17:03.556
Let me show you how it's done.

17:05.358 --> 17:08.128
(all)
Ninjago-o-o..

17:09.862 --> 17:11.531
Lucky shot.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.566
Tear them apart!

17:13.600 --> 17:16.569
[growling]

17:24.844 --> 17:27.347
Oh, no!

17:28.181 --> 17:32.185
We're...doomed!

17:36.889 --> 17:38.358
vroom

17:38.391 --> 17:40.693
Now, Jay, there's a speed limit.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.295
Mom is in trouble!

17:42.329 --> 17:45.432
And there are times
it's okay to ignore it.

17:45.465 --> 17:47.167
Hit it, son!

17:48.301 --> 17:49.402
What?

17:51.771 --> 17:55.175
Oh, I hope you brought water!

17:55.208 --> 17:56.576
Water won't help him.

17:56.609 --> 17:57.377
What are you doing?

17:57.410 --> 17:59.479
You're also going to slow
all of us.

17:59.512 --> 18:00.647
Exactly.

18:06.153 --> 18:08.121
What is that?

18:08.155 --> 18:09.622
screech

18:22.669 --> 18:24.804
[both screaming]

18:24.837 --> 18:25.838
[both groan]

18:25.872 --> 18:28.675
Ja-a-a-ay!

18:28.708 --> 18:29.842
So-o-n!

18:29.876 --> 18:31.511
Ha ha ha!

18:31.544 --> 18:32.745
[grunts]

18:32.779 --> 18:34.147
Stay here, dad.

18:34.181 --> 18:36.483
Well, what are you going to do?

18:36.516 --> 18:39.319
It's like you said,
"Never give up."

18:39.352 --> 18:43.656
Well, son, that's before I saw
everyone slow to a snail's pace.

18:45.658 --> 18:49.162
Which is why
we modified the bike.

18:49.762 --> 18:51.598
Oh!

18:52.832 --> 18:55.235
Lightning speed!

19:02.275 --> 19:04.544
[groaning]

19:16.556 --> 19:18.391
vroom

19:23.296 --> 19:24.497
Way to go, Jay!

19:24.531 --> 19:26.533
Talk about making a comeback!

19:26.566 --> 19:28.435
Sorry I left you before!
I can't stop!

19:28.468 --> 19:29.736
'Please help my dad
and get the blade!'

19:29.769 --> 19:31.704
'See you back in the temple!'

19:34.241 --> 19:36.276
Ha ha ha! Ugh!

19:39.912 --> 19:41.614
Looking for this?

19:42.549 --> 19:43.683
Catch!

19:43.716 --> 19:46.286
[grunts]

19:46.319 --> 19:47.987
Over here!

19:48.020 --> 19:49.689
Ha ha, close.

19:49.722 --> 19:51.424
No, almost.

19:51.458 --> 19:52.692
Guys, quit messin' around!

19:52.725 --> 19:55.262
We got the blade.
Let's get out of here!

19:55.295 --> 19:56.396
[exhales]
Remember how I said

19:56.429 --> 19:58.265
I like the way
Lloyd is taking charge?

19:58.298 --> 20:00.400
- Yeah.
- I take it back.

20:01.301 --> 20:02.669
After them!

20:06.473 --> 20:08.741
Go, go, go! Get the Time Blade!

20:14.347 --> 20:15.948
There's that symbol again.

20:15.982 --> 20:18.285
(Nya)
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

20:22.922 --> 20:24.291
[Nya panting]

20:24.324 --> 20:25.525
(Nya)
We're not going to make it.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.660
We don't have enough time!

20:28.961 --> 20:30.797
Yes, we do!

20:30.830 --> 20:32.299
Everyone! Behind me!

20:32.332 --> 20:34.434
We've all the time we need.

20:39.839 --> 20:45.645
(Raggmunk)
No-o-o-o!

20:45.678 --> 20:46.846
Come on, Mr. Walker

20:46.879 --> 20:48.648
that time bubble
won't last long.

20:48.681 --> 20:51.017
Well, will it last long enough
for us to get these heaps

20:51.050 --> 20:52.719
in the shop for repairs?

20:52.752 --> 20:54.020
Probably not.

20:54.053 --> 20:56.389
The Super Sonic Raider Jet!

20:59.392 --> 21:01.828
The only damage to the jet
is the port wing.

21:01.861 --> 21:02.929
Which I can stabilize.

21:02.962 --> 21:04.664
Everybody else in!

21:10.703 --> 21:12.805
(Cole)
'No, no, no, no!
Pull up! Pull up!'

21:14.106 --> 21:16.576
'Pull up! Pull up!'

21:16.609 --> 21:19.379
- 'You call this stabilizing?'
- 'I'm trying!'

21:19.412 --> 21:21.280
(Cole)
'Try harder!'

21:23.115 --> 21:26.419
[growling]

21:32.792 --> 21:36.796
Aah! What are we going to tell
the Hands Of Time?

21:36.829 --> 21:39.366
The moon was in our eyes?

21:39.399 --> 21:41.501
That's...not bad.

21:41.534 --> 21:43.436
Actually, yeah,
let's go with that.

21:44.571 --> 21:46.573
We did it.
We got the Time Blade.

21:46.606 --> 21:48.107
We finally caught a break.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.876
Nice work, Lloyd.

21:49.909 --> 21:52.512
Did you guys see
Jay take off on that bike?

21:52.545 --> 21:54.647
He was like grease lightning.

21:56.048 --> 21:57.049
What?

21:57.083 --> 21:58.951
He had grease on his face.

21:58.985 --> 22:00.987
And he's the Lightning Ninja..

22:01.020 --> 22:02.489
Oh, come on.

22:02.522 --> 22:04.090
You'd have laughed
if Jay said it.

22:04.123 --> 22:06.693
(Cole)
'No, no, we wouldn't have.'

22:06.726 --> 22:09.429
(Ed)
'I, uh, I thought
it was funny, Nya.'

22:09.462 --> 22:11.798
(Nya)
'Thank you, Mr. Walker.'

22:11.831 --> 22:16.669
Mm-hmm,
I see, moon in your eyes.

22:16.703 --> 22:18.037
Makes sense.

22:18.070 --> 22:20.106
Yes, I'll tell them.

22:20.139 --> 22:21.608
Goodbye.

22:21.641 --> 22:24.444
They failed.
As I suspected they would.

22:24.477 --> 22:27.580
What?
We didn't get the Time Blade?

22:27.614 --> 22:29.115
Not yet.

22:29.148 --> 22:31.718
[laughing]

22:31.751 --> 22:33.653
[dramatic music]

22:41.428 --> 22:44.531
[music continues]
