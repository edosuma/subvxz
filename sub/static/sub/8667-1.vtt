01:01.961 --> 01:06.864
Game three of the 1985 series
is just underway...

01:06.900 --> 01:08.697
Kansas City trailing by one.

01:10.236 --> 01:11.635
The first pitch by Rosenthal...

01:11.671 --> 01:13.502
is hit on the ground
towards second base!

01:15.308 --> 01:16.707
Wexler's got it!
Fires to first...

01:16.743 --> 01:18.438
and we've quickly got one out.

01:18.478 --> 01:22.039
In 1985, his average
was two-fifty for the season.

01:43.269 --> 01:44.395
Mom?

01:46.439 --> 01:47.565
Hi, darling.

01:51.644 --> 01:53.771
This is for your tea party.

01:53.813 --> 01:54.973
Thank you.

02:41.895 --> 02:44.864
Go on and play now, girls.
Mama's got work to do.

02:46.432 --> 02:49.401
Ivy, go take your sister
upstairs.

02:50.603 --> 02:51.865
Come on, Violet.

02:53.640 --> 02:55.437
Let's go get Joy.

03:05.485 --> 03:06.918
Would you like any tea,
Madeline?

03:10.056 --> 03:12.422
Careful, it's hot, very hot.

03:15.595 --> 03:16.755
There you go.

03:17.664 --> 03:18.961
And a cookie.

03:20.667 --> 03:23.192
-Can you play, Joy?
-Mm-hmm. Come on.

03:25.705 --> 03:28.037
Oh, goodie, tea.

04:49.689 --> 04:51.247
You pour some more tea, Violet.

05:04.404 --> 05:05.837
Your daddy's home, Joy.

05:07.206 --> 05:09.299
There's gonna be fireworks.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.211
Catherine?

05:34.067 --> 05:35.227
Honey?

06:14.407 --> 06:16.307
-Who the fuck are you?
-Don't!

06:20.980 --> 06:22.470
I don't want
to fight you, all right?

06:22.515 --> 06:24.005
Just get the hell out!

06:24.050 --> 06:26.018
Becca?

06:26.052 --> 06:27.610
Go.

06:33.826 --> 06:35.350
Baby, let me get you
some ice for that.

06:38.398 --> 06:39.558
Ivan, wait!

06:43.569 --> 06:44.866
You don't understand!

06:44.904 --> 06:46.565
Ivan, please,
would you listen to me?

06:46.606 --> 06:48.972
How many others, Rebecca?

06:49.008 --> 06:51.875
Grocery boy? The mailman?
How many?

06:51.911 --> 06:53.936
And in my house!

06:55.114 --> 06:57.810
You think this is easy,
sneaking around your wife...

06:57.850 --> 06:59.977
and pretending
there's nothing between us?

07:09.462 --> 07:10.588
You're home.

07:12.665 --> 07:13.825
How long...

07:16.035 --> 07:18.265
have you been sleeping
with my husband right here...

07:19.672 --> 07:21.435
in my own house?

07:23.309 --> 07:24.936
Ivan, tell her to get out.

07:25.745 --> 07:28.213
Ivan, tell her.

07:31.984 --> 07:33.417
Where are you going?

07:34.921 --> 07:36.115
Whore.

07:36.155 --> 07:38.419
I am not a whore.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.323
Then what are you?

07:40.359 --> 07:42.350
He told me what you're like
between the sheets.

07:42.395 --> 07:44.329
Is it any wonder
he needs a woman?

07:44.363 --> 07:45.853
It's happening again.

07:47.700 --> 07:48.928
Oh, no.

07:48.968 --> 07:51.903
I'm giving you twenty minutes
to get out of this house.

07:53.172 --> 07:55.106
And if you're not gone...

07:55.141 --> 07:57.575
I will call the police
and have you removed.

08:04.917 --> 08:06.976
Violet, take Madeline.

08:12.058 --> 08:13.548
I'll try to write to you.

09:00.172 --> 09:01.332
Thanks.

09:14.887 --> 09:16.218
May I help you?

09:18.724 --> 09:20.954
Is this still
the Greers' residence?

09:22.161 --> 09:23.719
Yes, it is.

09:23.763 --> 09:25.162
I'm here to see Joy.

09:26.599 --> 09:27.964
May I tell her who's calling?

09:45.518 --> 09:46.678
Violet?

09:52.892 --> 09:55.156
I can't believe it's you.

10:01.801 --> 10:02.927
Thank you, Mrs. B.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.599
It's hard to believe
it's been eleven years.

10:13.179 --> 10:16.273
Daddy refuses to believe
I'm not ten years old anymore.

10:23.789 --> 10:26.087
I just moved back here
from Arizona.

10:28.260 --> 10:30.285
I thought maybe I'd get
a waitressing job part-time...

10:30.329 --> 10:33.765
and maybe start some summer
classes at the junior college.

10:34.934 --> 10:36.231
That's wonderful.

10:36.268 --> 10:38.031
It makes me long
to be twenty again.

10:38.938 --> 10:40.428
Being twenty is hard.

10:41.974 --> 10:44.135
Not as hard as being eight...

10:44.176 --> 10:48.772
but then, life wasn't meant
to be easy, was it?

10:51.384 --> 10:52.817
Have you found an apartment?

10:52.852 --> 10:56.879
Not yet, but I put my name up
on the board at school.

10:56.922 --> 10:58.480
Why not stay here?

11:00.526 --> 11:01.959
I--I couldn't.

11:01.994 --> 11:04.895
But we have so much room.
It's not a problem.

11:06.165 --> 11:08.963
Joy, can I have a word with you
in the kitchen, please?

11:16.709 --> 11:18.233
Come here, you crap.

11:19.979 --> 11:22.948
Joy, having Violet stay here
is out of the question.

11:22.982 --> 11:26.042
-Why?
-Well, for many reasons.

11:26.085 --> 11:29.248
It's been a long time.
Things have changed.

11:29.288 --> 11:32.018
Dad, Violet was my best friend.

11:32.058 --> 11:34.424
When she and lvy were here,
it was like having sisters.

11:35.895 --> 11:37.829
Seeing her today
was like nothing had changed.

11:37.863 --> 11:40.423
I know that, sweetheart,
but where is she going to sleep?

11:41.600 --> 11:42.794
We have an extra bedroom.

11:47.973 --> 11:49.668
That was
your mother's room, Joy.

11:50.676 --> 11:52.166
I know that.

11:55.347 --> 11:56.939
What do you think, Mrs. B?

11:59.852 --> 12:01.979
Maybe the girl
could use a helping hand...

12:02.021 --> 12:03.784
if you know what I mean.

12:51.003 --> 12:53.471
I promised you
we'd be home again.

12:56.575 --> 12:58.065
Welcome home, Madeline.

13:47.893 --> 13:49.758
Seventy-six, seventy-seven...

13:49.795 --> 13:51.729
seventy-eight, seventy-nine...

13:51.764 --> 13:53.391
eighty, eighty-one...

13:53.432 --> 13:55.400
eighty-two, eighty-three...

13:55.434 --> 13:57.766
eighty-four, eighty-five...

13:57.803 --> 13:59.464
eighty-six, eighty-seven...

13:59.505 --> 14:01.996
eighty-eight, eighty-nine...

14:02.041 --> 14:03.508
ninety, ninety-one...

14:03.542 --> 14:05.976
ninety-two, ninety-three...

14:11.083 --> 14:13.381
ninety-four, ninety-five...

14:14.320 --> 14:16.015
Just a minute.

14:16.055 --> 14:19.354
Ninety-seven, ninety-eight,
ninety-nine, one hundred.

14:26.232 --> 14:27.358
Oh, my gosh.

14:33.339 --> 14:36.866
I'm supposed to be in training.

14:46.452 --> 14:47.942
You must be good.

14:50.489 --> 14:51.649
I'm proud of you.

14:58.163 --> 14:59.460
Who is this?

15:01.066 --> 15:02.260
Michael.

15:03.469 --> 15:05.733
-We're going to get married.
-Married?

15:05.771 --> 15:07.762
In the fall.

15:07.806 --> 15:09.239
Daddy wants us to wait...

15:09.275 --> 15:11.300
but Michael wants me to apply
for a transfer to Yale...

15:11.343 --> 15:13.573
so we can be together next year.

15:13.612 --> 15:16.775
Yale? Is that far away?

15:16.815 --> 15:18.248
Connecticut, silly.

15:19.952 --> 15:21.749
Michael will be home from school
next week.

15:21.787 --> 15:23.277
I can't wait for you
to meet him.

15:24.823 --> 15:26.450
He's very good-looking.

15:28.227 --> 15:30.161
Remember when we were little...

15:30.195 --> 15:32.527
and we used to dress up
like we were brides?

15:34.767 --> 15:36.826
You made a veil
out of a petticoat.

15:36.869 --> 15:40.066
And you made one out of
a whole roll of toilet paper.

15:50.149 --> 15:51.309
What about your dad?

15:53.385 --> 15:55.285
What's he going to do
when you get married?

15:56.922 --> 15:58.082
I don't know.

15:59.758 --> 16:01.953
Sometimes I'm afraid
he'll end up alone.

16:01.994 --> 16:04.189
He doesn't date?

16:04.229 --> 16:07.164
There's a woman named Gwen
he talks about.

16:07.199 --> 16:10.532
Mrs. B and I keep hoping he'll
find the time to ask her out.

16:10.569 --> 16:14.437
It wouldn't bother you
if he got serious or anything?

16:14.473 --> 16:18.000
Why should it?
He's been alone a long time.

16:18.043 --> 16:20.102
He deserves to be
with someone nice.

16:21.947 --> 16:24.245
But I don't think
he'll ever get over my mother.

16:26.585 --> 16:29.315
You've probably noticed
how her room is still the same.

16:31.357 --> 16:32.824
After all these years...

16:32.858 --> 16:35.019
Dad still can't bring himself
to change it.

16:35.060 --> 16:37.460
You must really miss her, too.

16:37.496 --> 16:38.656
I do.

16:40.899 --> 16:43.299
A lot.
I really need her sometimes.

19:21.527 --> 19:22.892
Connecticut?

20:13.812 --> 20:15.143
No, thank you, Mrs. B.

20:16.915 --> 20:18.712
How's Yale this year, Michael?

20:18.750 --> 20:20.115
Good, sir.

20:21.019 --> 20:23.419
I'm developing
some important relationships.

20:23.455 --> 20:24.786
Good.

20:24.823 --> 20:26.757
Michael's fourth in his class
this year.

20:26.792 --> 20:28.987
That's very impressive
for freshman year.

20:29.027 --> 20:30.255
It's very impressive
for any year.

20:30.295 --> 20:33.389
We're looking forward to you
at the bank this summer.

20:33.432 --> 20:34.558
See you on Monday?

20:34.600 --> 20:36.864
Absolutely.
I'm looking forward to it.

20:36.902 --> 20:40.565
Good. You've got the house
to yourselves tonight...

20:40.606 --> 20:41.800
-because I've--
-Got a meeting.

20:41.840 --> 20:43.569
That's right.

20:43.609 --> 20:45.236
-Good night, Dad.
-Good night.

20:45.277 --> 20:46.608
-Good night, sir.
-Good night, Michael.

20:50.115 --> 20:51.810
It's party time.

20:53.385 --> 20:55.785
Michael, you should've been
at the club for drinks.

20:55.821 --> 20:58.517
There's some new blood.

20:58.557 --> 21:01.185
All in good time, my brother.
All in good time.

21:01.226 --> 21:02.887
Scott, what's up?

21:03.695 --> 21:05.287
How's Princeton?

21:05.330 --> 21:06.456
A bitch.

21:06.498 --> 21:08.159
The classes or the girls?

21:08.200 --> 21:10.862
To uncompromising women.

21:10.902 --> 21:11.994
Hear, hear.

21:12.037 --> 21:14.164
So, I hear you're tearing up
the courts.

21:14.206 --> 21:16.572
Got my last Division One
Tournament on Friday.

21:16.608 --> 21:19.372
-Then hello lvy League.
-lf I win.

21:20.178 --> 21:23.409
No ifs. You're in your prime.
Jaimie, am I right?

21:23.448 --> 21:27.043
We have lived on that court
for the past two months.

21:27.085 --> 21:29.019
If she could eat and sleep
out there...

21:29.054 --> 21:30.885
that's where we'd be right now.

21:32.457 --> 21:33.617
You're Violet, right?

21:34.459 --> 21:36.484
What are you doing this summer?

21:36.528 --> 21:38.996
She's taking classes
at the junior college.

21:39.031 --> 21:40.896
Ooh!
The junior college.

21:40.932 --> 21:43.526
My maid took
English classes there.

21:43.568 --> 21:46.128
Is it a tough school
to get into?

21:46.171 --> 21:50.005
Oh, no. They'll accept
just about anybody...

21:50.042 --> 21:52.840
as long as your welfare check
doesn't bounce.

22:02.087 --> 22:03.247
No, thanks.

22:05.924 --> 22:08.586
No. I have to go to work.

22:08.627 --> 22:10.254
Right now?

22:10.295 --> 22:11.557
Yeah.

22:12.397 --> 22:14.456
I drew the late shift tonight.

22:14.499 --> 22:16.467
You know,
new kid on the block and all.

22:17.302 --> 22:18.462
Well...

22:19.638 --> 22:20.798
See ya.

22:26.411 --> 22:29.175
Oh, baby!

22:30.749 --> 22:33.343
You guys leave her alone.
She's had it pretty tough.

22:33.385 --> 22:35.979
What was she doing here
in the first place?

22:36.021 --> 22:38.251
Her mother was their maid.

22:38.290 --> 22:40.520
She was my best friend.

24:42.113 --> 24:43.876
Stop it!

24:44.583 --> 24:46.642
Damn it, Joy,
what's the matter now?

24:46.685 --> 24:48.380
I told you.
I have a lot on my mind.

24:48.420 --> 24:50.411
I have an early practice
tomorrow.

24:50.455 --> 24:52.150
I'm just not in the mood.

24:56.161 --> 24:57.287
If your mother
was this uptight...

24:57.329 --> 24:59.126
no wonder your dad
fooled around.

25:00.398 --> 25:02.457
How dare you say that to me.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.326
I confided in you about that.

25:05.370 --> 25:07.736
I can't believe
you would throw it in my face.

25:10.308 --> 25:11.605
Look, I'm sorry.

25:16.147 --> 25:18.615
How about I come by after
your practice tomorrow, OK?

25:51.483 --> 25:53.212
Oh, my God!

25:54.386 --> 25:56.217
You think it was Daddy?

25:56.254 --> 25:58.017
You scared me half to death.

26:20.345 --> 26:22.279
That's some...

26:22.314 --> 26:23.906
some outfit there.

26:23.949 --> 26:25.416
Where did you say
you worked again?

26:26.318 --> 26:28.149
Denny's.

26:28.186 --> 26:29.847
In Hollywood.

26:29.888 --> 26:32.220
It's under new management.

26:33.625 --> 26:37.026
I--I guess I've never eaten
there before.

26:40.532 --> 26:41.726
Would you like to?

26:45.270 --> 26:47.431
You should see
the look on your face.

26:49.608 --> 26:52.702
Look, it's kinda late.
I gotta go.

26:53.945 --> 26:56.175
Come on. It's a joke.

26:58.483 --> 27:01.418
Look, l...

27:01.453 --> 27:03.683
I think we got off
to a bad start.

27:28.680 --> 27:30.739
I see we have a little
unfinished business.

27:42.994 --> 27:44.325
Stock market's up...

27:47.899 --> 27:49.924
and I see
we're a major stockholder.

28:28.406 --> 28:29.566
Just a minute!

28:36.548 --> 28:37.674
Come in.

28:44.089 --> 28:46.523
I wanted to apologize
for my friends tonight.

28:46.558 --> 28:49.459
They can be pretty
annoying sometimes.

28:49.494 --> 28:51.894
Don't worry about it.
It didn't bother me.

28:51.930 --> 28:55.093
Well, it bothered me.
I'm sorry.

28:56.634 --> 28:58.101
Can I talk to you
about something?

28:59.304 --> 29:00.362
Sure.

29:01.740 --> 29:05.574
You never get...
urges or anything?

29:07.045 --> 29:09.104
I do. A lot.

29:11.349 --> 29:13.647
But when it comes down to it,
I just...

29:15.720 --> 29:17.210
get tense.

29:17.255 --> 29:19.689
I don't even want him inside me.

29:21.493 --> 29:23.256
I've never had an orgasm
with him.

29:26.297 --> 29:29.425
I've never even had an orgasm.

29:29.467 --> 29:31.799
I think my mother
was the same way.

29:31.836 --> 29:34.600
I mean, she did sleep
in this room most of the time.

29:36.007 --> 29:37.804
What if I'm just like her?

29:40.411 --> 29:42.402
The first time
I was with a guy...

29:43.681 --> 29:46.445
I was thirteen.

29:46.484 --> 29:49.112
I was known
as the school slut...

29:49.154 --> 29:50.815
by the time I was fourteen.

29:50.855 --> 29:52.823
But then I got smart.

29:55.527 --> 29:57.051
I stopped going to school.

30:06.671 --> 30:09.606
Excuse me.
Where did you get that?

30:09.641 --> 30:12.576
This? Why?

30:12.610 --> 30:14.271
It doesn't belong to you.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.038
Now, how would you know that?

30:17.081 --> 30:20.016
Because it belonged
to Mrs. Greer!

30:20.051 --> 30:24.181
She's not using it, is she?

31:40.031 --> 31:41.896
More coffee, Mr. Greer?

31:41.933 --> 31:44.629
No. No, thank you, Mrs. B.

31:55.113 --> 31:56.842
"Dearest Joy...

31:56.881 --> 31:59.941
"I've kicked. I'm clean.

31:59.984 --> 32:03.010
"I'm ready to make amends for
all the hurt I've laid on you.

32:03.054 --> 32:04.248
"Love, Michael."

32:06.324 --> 32:08.053
So...

32:08.092 --> 32:10.754
old Michael had
a little drug problem, did he?

32:28.579 --> 32:29.910
That honking for you?

32:29.948 --> 32:32.849
Yeah, it's Jaimie. We've got
a practice doubles match.

32:32.884 --> 32:34.112
When will you be back?

32:34.152 --> 32:35.983
Probably late.

32:36.020 --> 32:37.817
I was hoping we could spend
the day together.

32:37.855 --> 32:40.449
I've gotta practice.
Last Division One Tournament...

32:40.491 --> 32:42.823
is the day after tomorrow.
I gotta win.

32:42.860 --> 32:45.226
You don't gotta win, Joy.

32:45.263 --> 32:47.254
Yes, I do.

32:47.298 --> 32:50.426
You know,
you're really hard on yourself.

32:50.468 --> 32:53.266
You don't have to be perfect
all the time.

32:53.304 --> 32:56.501
If I were, I wouldn't work
twice as hard as everyone else.

32:59.344 --> 33:02.438
Jaimie and I will be
practicing here this afternoon.

33:02.480 --> 33:03.879
You should come watch.

33:07.685 --> 33:09.050
Oh, goody.

33:19.731 --> 33:21.096
What are you doing?

33:24.969 --> 33:26.493
Well, in case
you hadn't noticed...

33:26.537 --> 33:28.732
I am the housekeeper here.
This is what I do.

33:28.773 --> 33:31.139
I would appreciate it if,
from now on...

33:31.175 --> 33:33.837
you'd let me know when
you're going to come in my room.

33:53.164 --> 33:55.257
Larry's been a naughty boy.

34:03.941 --> 34:05.238
My time is your time.

34:05.276 --> 34:06.800
Where do you want to meet?

34:08.746 --> 34:09.974
What are you in the mood for?

34:10.014 --> 34:12.482
That'll cost extra, you know.

34:51.889 --> 34:54.755
Really?
They didn't tell me that.

34:54.792 --> 34:56.885
I can't believe that happened.

34:56.928 --> 34:59.954
-That's crazy.
-I need to play a real set.

34:59.997 --> 35:01.157
In a minute, OK?

35:01.199 --> 35:03.531
You're supposed to be
my training partner.

35:03.568 --> 35:05.399
All right, I'm coming.

35:05.436 --> 35:07.961
I'm gonna go get a drink.
Do you want anything?

35:08.005 --> 35:09.905
Anything. Just hurry up.

35:11.542 --> 35:12.839
Listen, I have to go, OK?

35:12.877 --> 35:14.936
No, really. I have to go.

35:42.273 --> 35:44.639
You guys look like you could use
something cold to drink.

35:44.675 --> 35:46.370
Excellent!

35:46.410 --> 35:48.844
Throw it in the blender.
Add a little ice...

35:48.880 --> 35:50.814
and you got yourselves
something tropical.

35:54.352 --> 35:56.547
A little extra kick never hurt.

35:56.587 --> 35:58.316
I suppose not.

36:49.307 --> 36:51.468
What did you put
in those drinks?

36:53.044 --> 36:55.535
The teeniest shot of rum.

36:57.882 --> 37:00.783
I swear--the teeniest!

37:00.818 --> 37:02.843
Play to win, ladies.

37:29.947 --> 37:31.744
I don't believe it.

37:31.782 --> 37:33.977
Come on, Joy.
Joy, sit up.

37:38.990 --> 37:40.150
Hey, there.

37:42.293 --> 37:43.453
What's goin' on?

37:44.996 --> 37:46.930
They're both drunk.

37:48.132 --> 37:50.123
That's weird.

37:50.167 --> 37:52.192
When's Mr. Greer get home?

37:52.236 --> 37:53.863
Probably any minute.
Why?

37:53.904 --> 37:56.702
Are you kidding?
He's a total fascist.

37:56.741 --> 37:58.606
If he sees Joy like this,
he'll freak.

37:58.643 --> 38:00.201
Come on.
Help me get her upstairs.

38:01.879 --> 38:03.642
We'll just tell him
she's got a headache.

38:03.681 --> 38:05.581
Yeah.
That won't be a lie.

38:05.616 --> 38:06.947
We'll have to come back for her.

38:08.953 --> 38:11.148
Michael, I'm gonna be sick.

38:11.188 --> 38:13.088
Oh, God, just hang on, OK?

38:18.663 --> 38:20.255
Wait.
Hold it a second.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.160
Are you crazy?

38:29.907 --> 38:31.067
Oh, man.

38:34.845 --> 38:36.472
Mr. Greer, how goes it?

38:36.514 --> 38:37.640
Where's Joy?

38:39.317 --> 38:41.217
She went upstairs
with a headache.

38:41.252 --> 38:43.345
She was on the court all day,
and I guess she overdid it.

38:43.387 --> 38:46.481
-I'd better look in on her.
-No. I'll do it.

38:47.625 --> 38:49.752
All right, Michael.
Thank you.

38:55.266 --> 38:56.824
Man.

39:03.641 --> 39:04.801
Get the lights.

39:12.083 --> 39:13.243
That's good.

39:25.229 --> 39:27.629
I just don't understand
what Joy was thinking.

39:27.665 --> 39:30.600
She knows she needs every second
of practice she can get.

39:30.634 --> 39:31.931
This could screw up everything.

39:31.969 --> 39:34.437
-Maybe that's what she wants.
-What?

39:35.940 --> 39:38.101
Never mind.
It's not my place.

39:38.142 --> 39:39.609
Did she say something to you?

39:41.479 --> 39:42.969
Well, the way she talks...

39:43.013 --> 39:45.379
it sounds like she thinks things
are moving a little too fast.

39:45.416 --> 39:47.816
Getting married,
moving to Connecticut--

39:47.852 --> 39:49.376
But we already decided.

39:51.989 --> 39:55.686
She thinks maybe you're pushing
a little too hard.

39:57.194 --> 39:59.628
She thinks maybe you guys should
try dating other people.

39:59.663 --> 40:01.688
What are you talking about?

40:01.732 --> 40:03.893
Are you saying she's been
seeing other people...

40:03.934 --> 40:05.902
while I've been away
or something?

40:07.405 --> 40:08.633
Shit!

40:08.672 --> 40:10.162
Who is it?

40:10.207 --> 40:12.038
I can't believe it.

40:12.076 --> 40:13.600
I can't believe
she's cheated on me...

40:13.644 --> 40:15.475
after I've been faithful
this whole time.

40:15.513 --> 40:17.105
Except for last night.

40:20.551 --> 40:21.745
Listen...

40:23.487 --> 40:25.045
you just stay away from me,
all right?

40:50.247 --> 40:51.839
You didn't have any dinner.

40:51.882 --> 40:55.079
Thank you so much, Violet.
That's so sweet.

40:55.119 --> 40:56.780
What is this stuff?

40:57.788 --> 40:59.722
It's nothing--spreadsheets.

41:01.759 --> 41:03.454
No wonder your eyes hurt.

41:04.295 --> 41:05.922
Is all this stuff
really part of your job?

41:05.963 --> 41:09.023
I'm afraid so, Violet.
Keeps me out of trouble, though.

41:09.066 --> 41:11.557
Maybe a little trouble
isn't such a bad thing.

41:11.602 --> 41:12.899
Excuse me?

41:12.937 --> 41:16.896
It just seems to me
like you're avoiding something.

41:20.077 --> 41:21.476
Joy told me that you've...

41:21.512 --> 41:23.878
never really gotten
over Catherine's death.

41:25.950 --> 41:27.577
You know...

41:27.618 --> 41:30.143
there's nothing wrong
with having feelings, Ivan.

41:30.187 --> 41:32.781
I can call you Ivan?

41:33.958 --> 41:35.789
If you feel something...

41:37.461 --> 41:40.919
go with it. You know?

41:40.965 --> 41:42.956
I mean...

41:43.000 --> 41:45.833
don't be afraid
to follow where it leads.

41:46.770 --> 41:47.930
Otherwise...

41:49.807 --> 41:51.331
what would be the point
of living?

41:51.375 --> 41:52.672
Spreadsheets?

41:56.013 --> 41:57.810
Well...

41:57.848 --> 41:59.577
don't work too hard.

42:03.120 --> 42:04.280
Good night.

42:59.677 --> 43:00.837
Oh, my God.

43:10.888 --> 43:12.116
Where are you going?

43:12.156 --> 43:15.023
Wait, don't leave yet.

43:15.059 --> 43:16.993
Joy'll be right back.

43:17.027 --> 43:19.120
Oh, my God!

44:12.850 --> 44:14.613
Do you always swim in the nude?

44:14.652 --> 44:16.017
Did you enjoy that?

44:17.421 --> 44:19.412
Not as much as you did, I bet.

44:20.991 --> 44:22.322
Actually, l...

44:23.594 --> 44:25.494
didn't even know
you were still here.

44:28.032 --> 44:30.592
I'm not leaving until l
straighten things out with Joy.

44:31.835 --> 44:34.326
Have you decided
what you're going to say to her?

44:34.371 --> 44:35.895
Not exactly.

44:38.409 --> 44:39.967
Maybe this will help.

44:44.148 --> 44:47.311
I don't do that anymore.
I made a promise to Joy.

44:47.351 --> 44:49.216
Aren't you a good boy?

44:55.492 --> 44:57.357
I just thought it might help.

45:30.994 --> 45:33.360
I'll bet you've promised
yourself all sorts of things...

45:33.397 --> 45:34.955
where Joy is concerned...

45:34.998 --> 45:37.626
but promises were meant
to be broken, Michael.

48:23.767 --> 48:26.497
Look, this did not happen.

48:41.351 --> 48:42.841
Play to win, Michael.

49:02.306 --> 49:03.773
You know...

49:03.807 --> 49:06.503
my old mother used to say...

49:06.543 --> 49:10.206
that house guests and fish...

49:10.247 --> 49:13.307
start to smell
after about three days.

49:14.618 --> 49:16.051
And what is that
supposed to mean?

49:16.086 --> 49:17.747
Oh, nothing.

49:17.788 --> 49:21.315
You know,
I was wondering...the "B."

49:21.358 --> 49:23.053
Short for "bitch"?

49:31.001 --> 49:33.936
I feel like I've been
hit by a truck.

49:33.971 --> 49:35.131
Drink this.

49:41.044 --> 49:42.841
Does my dad know?

49:42.879 --> 49:46.815
Actually, he thinks you went
to bed early with a headache.

49:46.850 --> 49:48.818
I can't believe Jaimie...

49:48.852 --> 49:50.513
getting me drunk
and then splitting like that.

49:50.554 --> 49:52.886
I'm so angry at her.

49:52.923 --> 49:55.187
She seemed
a little upset herself.

49:55.225 --> 49:56.749
I'd like to strangle her.

49:56.793 --> 49:59.353
I have exactly twenty-one hours
until the tournament...

49:59.396 --> 50:01.261
and I can't even see straight.

50:01.298 --> 50:03.664
Well, I'll keep
the coffee coming.

50:06.937 --> 50:10.134
Michael left his jacket
in my den, and this fell out.

50:10.173 --> 50:11.902
I can't allow this
in my business...

50:11.942 --> 50:13.739
and I will not allow it
in my family.

50:13.777 --> 50:15.938
Do you understand me, Joy?

50:17.514 --> 50:19.482
It's gotta be a mistake.

50:19.516 --> 50:22.485
The only mistake
is me allowing you to date him.

50:22.519 --> 50:25.545
Shouldn't we give him
a chance to explain himself?

50:26.690 --> 50:28.385
I know you'll do
the right thing.

50:39.603 --> 50:42.868
He promised me never again.
He lied to me.

50:44.741 --> 50:47.403
Nothing's more important
than the truth, Joy.

50:50.480 --> 50:52.607
But I guess you can't
expect that from a druggie.

50:52.649 --> 50:55.311
He's not a druggie.
He's just...

50:55.352 --> 50:57.650
He's under
a lot of pressure, and...

51:01.825 --> 51:03.315
What am I gonna do?

51:05.162 --> 51:06.322
Listen...

51:08.265 --> 51:10.392
Everything's gonna be OK.

51:12.035 --> 51:14.560
Everything's gonna be just fine.

51:16.740 --> 51:18.037
I promise.

51:21.778 --> 51:24.076
Jaimie doesn't want
to see me anymore.

51:24.114 --> 51:26.378
And she doesn't want
to be partners, either.

51:27.250 --> 51:28.842
I'm not surprised.

51:28.885 --> 51:30.113
I knew from the minute
I met her...

51:30.153 --> 51:32.280
she was only into you
for what she could get.

51:33.390 --> 51:35.051
You think so?

51:35.092 --> 51:37.026
She's nothing but
a social climber.

51:42.099 --> 51:43.657
It's Michael.

51:43.700 --> 51:44.997
I'll go down and talk to him.

51:45.035 --> 51:46.627
Thanks.

51:51.775 --> 51:54.437
I want to talk to her about it.

51:54.478 --> 51:57.709
Michael, you're really starting
to hurt my feelings.

51:57.747 --> 51:59.908
What are you talking about?

51:59.950 --> 52:03.909
You can't keep pretending
we're not sleeping together.

52:03.954 --> 52:07.617
I mean, I thought we had
something special going.

52:09.993 --> 52:12.587
You told her about last night,
didn't you?

52:12.629 --> 52:15.530
-You bitch.
-I didn't tell her anything.

52:16.666 --> 52:20.568
I didn't have to.
You did this all by yourself.

52:37.821 --> 52:40.756
His pupils were totally dilated.

52:40.790 --> 52:42.553
He wasn't making any sense.

52:43.793 --> 52:46.626
He thinks the reason you won't
talk to him is because of me.

52:47.831 --> 52:50.527
It's just like him
to blame everyone but himself.

52:53.503 --> 52:55.801
Don't help him, Joy.

52:55.839 --> 52:56.999
Fuck him.

52:59.009 --> 53:00.101
All right.

53:01.178 --> 53:02.770
I have to stop
making excuses for him.

53:02.812 --> 53:04.905
I have to be tough.

53:04.948 --> 53:06.973
He has to take responsibility.

53:19.829 --> 53:21.922
Michael just doesn't give up,
does he?

53:23.700 --> 53:25.861
They're not from Michael.

53:25.902 --> 53:28.268
They're for Gwen,
your dad's date for tonight.

53:28.305 --> 53:29.966
He finally asked her out?

53:30.006 --> 53:31.439
Yes, he did.

53:41.484 --> 53:42.576
How do I look, Mrs. B?

53:42.619 --> 53:45.520
Mr. Greer,
in my humble opinion...

53:45.555 --> 53:46.988
you are beyond handsome.

53:47.023 --> 53:48.490
Thank you, Mrs. B.

53:49.626 --> 53:51.059
Could you get the flowers
for me?

53:57.701 --> 53:58.827
Hi, honey.

53:58.868 --> 53:59.960
Hey, Dad.

54:01.471 --> 54:03.803
Wow. Very handsome.

54:03.840 --> 54:06.400
Thanks.
Where are you off to?

54:06.443 --> 54:07.603
Meeting my coach to practice...

54:07.644 --> 54:10.169
one last time
before the big tournament.

54:10.213 --> 54:12.704
Honey, with everything
happening around us...

54:12.749 --> 54:14.649
I realize I haven't been
that supportive of you...

54:14.684 --> 54:17.152
but I want you to know
there's no doubt in my mind...

54:17.187 --> 54:18.449
you're going to win
that tournament.

54:19.389 --> 54:22.017
Thanks, Dad. I just hope
I don't let you down.

54:22.058 --> 54:23.685
You're a Greer. We deliver.

54:23.727 --> 54:26.719
-Here you go!
-Mrs. B, thank you.

54:26.763 --> 54:28.162
All right.

54:28.198 --> 54:30.063
You got some lint
right on your shoulder.

54:30.100 --> 54:31.863
Let me get my brush.

54:31.901 --> 54:35.701
That's gonna have to stay.
I've got to get out of here.

54:35.739 --> 54:37.172
Come on, Joy, Let's go.

54:47.317 --> 54:49.148
-Hello?
-Hi, this is Gwen Randall.

54:49.185 --> 54:51.653
-Is this Ivan's daughter?
-Yes, it is.

54:51.688 --> 54:53.747
Listen, Joy.
Has your dad left yet?

54:54.958 --> 54:56.983
Shoot.
Can you get a message to him?

54:57.027 --> 54:58.494
Absolutely.

54:58.528 --> 55:00.587
Could you have him meet me
outside the courthouse...

55:00.630 --> 55:03.599
and not at my office?
In front of the kiosk.

55:03.633 --> 55:05.430
-You've got it.
-Thanks, Joy.

55:05.468 --> 55:06.992
No problem. Thanks.

55:30.727 --> 55:33.025
Hello,
this is the Greer residence.

55:33.063 --> 55:35.623
Will you please leave a message
after the tone?

55:37.200 --> 55:38.599
Ivan, what happened?

55:38.635 --> 55:41.195
I stood outside the courthouse
for nearly an hour.

55:41.237 --> 55:44.070
To say I'm pissed off
would be an understatement.

55:44.107 --> 55:46.405
In fact, do me a favor...

55:46.443 --> 55:47.876
and lose my number.

56:09.799 --> 56:10.993
I love champagne.

56:20.977 --> 56:22.877
Violet, you're not legal.

56:22.912 --> 56:24.277
I won't tell if you won't.

56:27.317 --> 56:28.716
Why are you so dressed up?

56:28.752 --> 56:29.912
Party.

56:33.456 --> 56:34.616
You're home early.

56:36.459 --> 56:38.256
She didn't like them?

56:38.294 --> 56:40.228
Actually, she stood me up.

56:40.263 --> 56:43.096
-I'm sorry.
-I'll live.

56:43.133 --> 56:46.364
You know, in all my life...

56:46.403 --> 56:48.268
I don't think
I've ever gotten flowers.

57:01.584 --> 57:04.280
I just wanted to feel pretty
tonight.

57:04.320 --> 57:06.254
Maybe dance a little.

57:08.925 --> 57:10.324
Laugh.

57:13.730 --> 57:14.890
Feel good.

57:19.869 --> 57:22.394
I know that must seem silly.
I know.

57:32.882 --> 57:34.042
Dance with me?

57:36.920 --> 57:38.820
I'm not much of a dancer,
Violet.

57:38.855 --> 57:39.844
It's all right.

58:16.626 --> 58:17.991
We can't do this, Violet.

58:20.296 --> 58:22.127
I want you to feel good, too.

59:01.304 --> 59:04.068
Shouldn't you be wearing
your glasses, Mr. Greer?

59:47.483 --> 59:49.542
I cannot do this with you,
Violet.

59:56.893 --> 59:59.020
Don't make me go.

59:59.062 --> 01:00:00.586
Don't do this to me.

01:03:02.245 --> 01:03:05.681
I will win. I will win.

01:03:05.715 --> 01:03:07.876
Please let me win.

01:03:19.228 --> 01:03:21.628
Joy, you're gonna have
to speak to me sooner or later.

01:03:21.664 --> 01:03:24.326
Michael,
I want you to leave me alone.

01:03:24.367 --> 01:03:25.698
That's not fair.

01:03:25.735 --> 01:03:27.032
Fair?

01:03:28.871 --> 01:03:30.304
God, you are driving me crazy...

01:03:30.339 --> 01:03:32.034
and I've got the tournament
this morning.

01:03:32.074 --> 01:03:33.939
I know.
I want to be there for you.

01:03:34.844 --> 01:03:36.175
I love you, Joy.

01:03:37.413 --> 01:03:38.471
I don't know, Michael.

01:03:48.591 --> 01:03:50.058
All right, we'll talk.

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:53.326
After the tournament,
I'll meet you...

01:03:53.362 --> 01:03:54.829
at the coffee-house on campus.

01:03:57.333 --> 01:03:58.493
I gotta go.

01:04:00.436 --> 01:04:01.528
Good luck.

01:04:01.571 --> 01:04:02.731
Thanks.

01:04:11.881 --> 01:04:13.508
Greer residence.

01:04:13.549 --> 01:04:15.540
Hello, Gwen!

01:04:15.585 --> 01:04:18.452
No. His daughter's in a tennis
tournament this morning...

01:04:18.487 --> 01:04:20.819
but I'm sure he'll be
in his office later on.

01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:22.256
Can I take a message?

01:04:24.126 --> 01:04:26.321
You did?
How many messages did you leave?

01:04:28.564 --> 01:04:29.724
I see.

01:04:31.767 --> 01:04:33.064
Well, I can guarantee you...

01:04:33.102 --> 01:04:35.662
that he never received
any of your messages...

01:04:36.973 --> 01:04:38.372
but I'm pretty sure who did.

01:04:43.679 --> 01:04:45.340
Going somewhere?

01:04:45.381 --> 01:04:48.612
I don't know what you think
you're up to, little girl...

01:04:48.651 --> 01:04:51.119
but I'm gonna put a stop to it
right now.

01:04:51.153 --> 01:04:53.053
I don't think so.

01:05:05.635 --> 01:05:07.125
You bitch.

01:05:07.169 --> 01:05:09.603
I got a call from Greer telling
me not to report to my job...

01:05:09.639 --> 01:05:11.971
because they found
another intern.

01:05:12.008 --> 01:05:14.306
You set me up, you got me high,
and you seduced me.

01:05:15.278 --> 01:05:16.836
If that's what
you need to believe...

01:05:16.879 --> 01:05:18.676
so you can live with yourself...

01:05:18.714 --> 01:05:20.147
it's OK with me.

01:05:20.182 --> 01:05:22.173
You're setting them up
just like you set me up.

01:05:22.218 --> 01:05:24.015
They're my family.

01:05:24.053 --> 01:05:26.283
I would never do anything
to hurt them.

01:05:26.322 --> 01:05:29.086
They're not your family!
Your family's dead.

01:05:30.259 --> 01:05:33.194
Yeah. That's right.
I did a little checking.

01:05:33.229 --> 01:05:35.356
That junior college
never even heard of you.

01:05:35.398 --> 01:05:37.662
Then I find out your sister lvy
threw herself out of a window.

01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:40.692
-Shut up.
-Let's not forget your mother.

01:05:40.736 --> 01:05:41.725
I said shut up!

01:05:42.872 --> 01:05:45.898
I bet you don't even work
at Denny's, do you?

01:05:49.412 --> 01:05:50.777
Now what?

01:05:52.181 --> 01:05:54.479
I'm gonna tell Joy
who she's really living with.

01:05:54.517 --> 01:05:56.246
You're gonna tell her
you're fucking me?

01:05:56.285 --> 01:05:58.310
I'm gonna tell her the truth.

01:05:58.354 --> 01:06:01.323
That'll be
an interesting approach for you.

01:06:01.357 --> 01:06:02.688
Think she'll buy it?

01:06:03.492 --> 01:06:05.722
I don't think it's gonna be
too hard to convince her.

01:06:05.761 --> 01:06:08.491
Look, I'm going to meet her
at two o'clock.

01:06:08.531 --> 01:06:11.056
That'll give you enough time
to get out.

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:13.068
Well, she won't be there.

01:06:13.102 --> 01:06:14.467
She never planned to meet you.

01:06:14.503 --> 01:06:17.597
-You're such a liar.
-Really?

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:19.733
Then why did she tell
your good buddy Scott...

01:06:19.775 --> 01:06:22.437
to pick her up at the house
at one thirty?

01:06:28.684 --> 01:06:29.844
Fuck you.

01:06:45.134 --> 01:06:47.568
You're gonna be so sorry.

01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:35.939
Curiosity killed the cat.

01:08:35.978 --> 01:08:38.606
Right now, Joy's sitting
somewhere waiting for you.

01:08:40.282 --> 01:08:42.307
Guess you let her down again,
Michael.

01:08:53.295 --> 01:08:55.490
Do you know what kind of people
like pain?

01:08:58.734 --> 01:09:00.827
Let's see, there's doctors...

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:01.996
and lawyers...

01:09:03.139 --> 01:09:05.505
I even have a judge
for a client.

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:11.438
But you know, it's not the pain
that gets them off.

01:09:13.215 --> 01:09:15.944
It's the feeling of someone else
being in control.

01:09:18.386 --> 01:09:20.685
I'm in control now, Michael.

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:26.651
You know,
this whole thing with Joy...

01:09:26.694 --> 01:09:29.720
was really just about
Daddy's bank...

01:09:29.765 --> 01:09:30.925
wasn't it?

01:09:33.935 --> 01:09:37.372
I got a really big chuckle
out of your pathetic rambling.

01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:43.069
Kiss-kiss.

01:09:48.017 --> 01:09:51.417
You really should have
kept your promise to Joy.

01:09:54.623 --> 01:09:56.557
Stayed away from the drugs.

01:10:00.963 --> 01:10:02.487
This is the shit
that killed you.

01:10:08.437 --> 01:10:09.995
I guarantee...

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:14.771
you've never felt
anything like this before.

01:10:27.356 --> 01:10:28.584
Bye-bye, Michael.

01:10:56.986 --> 01:10:58.146
You all right?

01:10:58.187 --> 01:11:01.384
I played like I never held
a racquet before in my life.

01:11:01.423 --> 01:11:04.085
I just...I couldn't
concentrate, you know?

01:11:05.928 --> 01:11:07.088
It's Michael's fault.

01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:10.491
He totally distracted you.

01:11:10.532 --> 01:11:12.557
He didn't even show up.

01:11:12.601 --> 01:11:14.569
He didn't call again, did he?

01:11:14.603 --> 01:11:16.195
Come by?

01:11:16.238 --> 01:11:17.728
I've been here all day.

01:11:19.975 --> 01:11:22.170
I wanted to teach Michael
a lesson...

01:11:22.211 --> 01:11:23.769
not make him go away.

01:11:25.414 --> 01:11:27.109
Made a mess of everything.

01:11:30.119 --> 01:11:32.747
You don't see it.
It's not you.

01:11:34.923 --> 01:11:36.584
It's them.

01:11:36.625 --> 01:11:39.492
But I want them to love me.

01:11:39.528 --> 01:11:42.395
You think they care?
Well, they never will.

01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:47.260
They'll just use you
and throw you away.

01:11:47.303 --> 01:11:49.703
It's the same
for both of us, Joy.

01:11:51.974 --> 01:11:53.908
We're the same in so many ways.

01:11:55.811 --> 01:11:56.971
Sometimes...

01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:00.976
I just wish the rest
of the world would fade away.

01:12:03.886 --> 01:12:05.183
Where did you get those?

01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:07.051
Those are my mother's.

01:12:08.791 --> 01:12:11.282
I just came across them.

01:12:11.327 --> 01:12:13.488
I didn't think you'd mind
if I borrowed them.

01:12:13.529 --> 01:12:16.862
They were in her jewelry box
in the back of her closet.

01:12:18.434 --> 01:12:19.867
Please put them back.

01:12:19.902 --> 01:12:21.199
Fine.

01:12:22.204 --> 01:12:23.501
It's not that big of a deal.

01:12:23.539 --> 01:12:25.769
Yes, it is, Violet.

01:12:25.808 --> 01:12:28.242
I think things are getting
a little too tense around here.

01:12:28.277 --> 01:12:30.404
What are you trying to say?

01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:33.846
I think maybe...

01:12:33.882 --> 01:12:35.213
it would be a good idea...

01:12:35.250 --> 01:12:38.048
if you started thinking about
another place to live.

01:13:07.516 --> 01:13:08.676
Don't worry, baby.

01:13:11.954 --> 01:13:13.114
I'll fix it.

01:13:15.824 --> 01:13:16.984
I promise.

01:13:42.384 --> 01:13:44.113
Oh, my God, he was here.

01:13:46.889 --> 01:13:48.220
She lied to me.

01:14:07.009 --> 01:14:08.408
I...

01:14:08.444 --> 01:14:09.570
I brought these for Joy.

01:14:09.611 --> 01:14:12.409
I know she's feeling upset
about...

01:14:12.448 --> 01:14:13.574
Losing the tournament.

01:14:13.615 --> 01:14:16.049
Well, I'm sure she'll love them.

01:14:21.256 --> 01:14:22.689
I talked to Gwen today.

01:14:24.193 --> 01:14:26.161
You pretended you were Joy,
didn't you?

01:14:26.195 --> 01:14:27.856
You didn't give me her messages.

01:14:48.016 --> 01:14:51.213
I didn't give you
the messages...

01:14:51.253 --> 01:14:52.618
because I was jealous.

01:14:56.391 --> 01:14:57.688
Joy was wrong.

01:14:57.726 --> 01:14:58.818
About what?

01:14:59.928 --> 01:15:01.657
It wasn't Catherine
I couldn't get over.

01:15:03.365 --> 01:15:04.730
It was your mother.

01:15:05.734 --> 01:15:07.895
God, you look so much like her.

01:15:16.111 --> 01:15:18.375
I told you, I just can't do this
with you, Violet.

01:15:20.482 --> 01:15:22.143
But you already have...

01:15:24.019 --> 01:15:25.953
only I'm not gonna let you
turn away from me...

01:15:25.988 --> 01:15:27.478
Like you did her.

01:16:16.405 --> 01:16:17.736
No. This is his father.

01:16:17.773 --> 01:16:20.264
Mr. Beckett.
I was just looking for Michael.

01:16:20.309 --> 01:16:22.436
I'm afraid I have
some bad news for you.

01:16:22.477 --> 01:16:23.842
What?

01:16:23.879 --> 01:16:25.437
Michael's been found dead.

01:16:27.182 --> 01:16:28.410
What?

01:16:28.450 --> 01:16:29.940
They're not sure yet,
but it seems like...

01:16:29.985 --> 01:16:31.418
he might have been murdered.

01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:45.860
Daddy?

01:16:52.407 --> 01:16:53.635
Oh, my God!

01:16:58.547 --> 01:17:00.014
Untie me.

01:17:08.590 --> 01:17:10.057
Joy, please don't leave.

01:17:16.598 --> 01:17:17.895
Oh, God.

01:17:19.701 --> 01:17:21.191
Stop it, Violet.

01:17:22.471 --> 01:17:26.601
Ivan, everything's gonna
be all right.

01:17:29.411 --> 01:17:32.039
I should never have
taken advantage of you, Violet.

01:17:36.418 --> 01:17:38.716
You've got to go,
and you've got to go now.

01:17:41.757 --> 01:17:42.917
Go?

01:17:45.527 --> 01:17:46.994
You fucked me...

01:17:49.131 --> 01:17:50.996
and now you're throwing me out?

01:17:52.934 --> 01:17:54.458
Just like my mother.

01:17:56.004 --> 01:17:58.063
You promised
to take care of her...

01:17:59.007 --> 01:18:01.100
and that she would be
provided for.

01:18:03.545 --> 01:18:06.412
I told you I wouldn't let you
turn away from me.

01:18:09.017 --> 01:18:10.177
I meant it.

01:18:19.127 --> 01:18:20.594
Just get out.

01:19:04.773 --> 01:19:07.367
If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.

01:19:12.647 --> 01:19:13.909
Help me.

01:22:51.833 --> 01:22:52.959
Mrs. B, I need to come in.

01:22:53.001 --> 01:22:55.094
The breaker box
is in your closet.

01:24:23.892 --> 01:24:25.052
Daddy.

01:25:48.810 --> 01:25:50.334
Oh, my God.

01:26:02.223 --> 01:26:04.953
-Where's my father?
-He's gone.

01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:06.187
What have you done with him?

01:26:07.328 --> 01:26:08.761
He did it to himself.

01:26:08.796 --> 01:26:10.388
What are you talking about?

01:26:10.431 --> 01:26:13.093
Here. Put this on.

01:26:14.736 --> 01:26:15.896
I don't think I want to.

01:26:15.937 --> 01:26:17.962
I want you to.

01:26:18.006 --> 01:26:20.031
Besides...

01:26:20.074 --> 01:26:21.803
you can't go like that.

01:26:21.843 --> 01:26:23.708
Go? Go where?

01:26:23.745 --> 01:26:26.407
We're going together...

01:26:26.447 --> 01:26:28.312
but we have to be dressed up...

01:26:28.349 --> 01:26:32.513
so, here, put it on.

01:26:34.522 --> 01:26:35.682
All right.

01:26:45.733 --> 01:26:48.361
You're really
freaking me out, Violet.

01:26:48.403 --> 01:26:49.563
Now, sit...

01:26:50.605 --> 01:26:51.629
and I'll pour tea.

01:26:51.673 --> 01:26:53.402
I don't want to sit, Violet.

01:26:54.776 --> 01:26:56.767
I'm very scared.

01:26:56.811 --> 01:26:58.210
Don't be scared.

01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:01.742
I told you
I'll take care of everything...

01:27:01.783 --> 01:27:03.546
and I will...

01:27:05.119 --> 01:27:06.416
but you have to trust me.

01:27:07.956 --> 01:27:11.357
Now...sit down.

01:27:12.927 --> 01:27:14.224
Where's my father?

01:27:19.534 --> 01:27:21.627
You killed Michael, didn't you?

01:27:23.137 --> 01:27:25.367
You're so lucky I'm your sister.

01:27:26.808 --> 01:27:29.174
Who else would have gone
to all the trouble for you?

01:27:29.210 --> 01:27:31.007
They didn't want us
to be together...

01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:34.441
but now they can't stop us.

01:27:35.817 --> 01:27:37.284
We'll be together forever.

01:27:37.318 --> 01:27:38.546
What do you mean?

01:27:38.586 --> 01:27:39.814
Here.

01:27:40.888 --> 01:27:41.946
Hold this.

01:27:44.592 --> 01:27:45.820
Take it!

01:27:56.671 --> 01:27:58.070
Now...

01:27:59.307 --> 01:28:01.138
all you have to do is drink.

01:28:03.111 --> 01:28:04.601
You'll drink first...

01:28:06.381 --> 01:28:10.249
and then I'll hold you
until you fall asleep.

01:28:10.285 --> 01:28:12.583
I'll have to hold you tight...

01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:15.111
to stop you
from thrashing around so much.

01:28:16.291 --> 01:28:17.280
Then I'll drink.

01:28:19.060 --> 01:28:20.584
And I'll lay down beside you...

01:28:22.063 --> 01:28:23.189
and hold your hand.

01:28:25.199 --> 01:28:28.965
Now...drink.

01:28:38.579 --> 01:28:39.841
You bitch!

01:28:53.861 --> 01:28:56.159
I tried to make it easier
for you...

01:28:59.167 --> 01:29:01.431
but I guess
we'll have to do it your way.

01:29:23.358 --> 01:29:24.825
Help!

01:29:37.405 --> 01:29:38.997
-Help!
-Grab my hand.
