WEBVTT

00:10.368 --> 00:11.828
Make a wish!

00:14.956 --> 00:16.624
Mommy, see?
Do you see?

00:16.624 --> 00:18.709
Yeah, I saw you.
I saw you.

00:22.171 --> 00:23.339
Mommy, I'm hot.

00:23.339 --> 00:25.758
Okay, all right.
You having a good time?

00:25.758 --> 00:26.968
Yeah.

00:26.968 --> 00:29.053
All right.
Back you go.

00:35.143 --> 00:37.061
Ruthie, stay where I can see you.

00:37.061 --> 00:38.104
Okay.

01:00.501 --> 01:01.544
Ruthie?

01:09.635 --> 01:10.720
Ruthie?

01:14.766 --> 01:15.808
Ruthie?

01:22.315 --> 01:23.316
Ruthie?

01:31.616 --> 01:32.658
Ruthie?

01:35.703 --> 01:36.370
Lady, what's wrong?

01:36.370 --> 01:37.955
I can't find my baby.

01:38.790 --> 01:39.832
Ruthie!

01:47.840 --> 01:48.424
Hold it.

01:48.424 --> 01:50.301
Hold it right there.

01:53.429 --> 01:54.764
Ruthie, where are you?

01:57.892 --> 02:00.436
Ruthie Crighton, five years old.

02:00.436 --> 02:05.233
Paramedics just pronounced. She was found
by an employee in the handicapped bathroom.

02:05.274 --> 02:07.068
Nobody leaves.

02:07.068 --> 02:09.487
Mother lost a child here.

02:09.487 --> 02:14.283
To get to the bathroom the guy had
to go past the arcade past the food court ...

02:15.326 --> 02:17.829
... and past who knows
how many people.

02:17.829 --> 02:22.250
This place is a buffet for these creeps.
Where is she?

02:22.250 --> 02:23.292
In the back.

03:07.962 --> 03:09.297
Fifty witnesses.

03:09.505 --> 03:10.548
Fifty suspects.

04:18.998 --> 04:22.335
Welcome to the next forty-eight hours
of your life ladies and gentlemen.

04:22.335 --> 04:27.298
Eric, first, let's extend this inner perimeter
from the playground to the rear bathroom.

04:27.298 --> 04:29.050
Speed, photograph
everything, please ...

04:29.050 --> 04:32.053
Calleigh, let's check into the
surveillance system right here.

04:32.053 --> 04:33.680
When and where was
the victim last seen.

04:33.680 --> 04:38.726
Exactly right. Live-scan every finger including
children, and let's  look at that videotape.

04:38.726 --> 04:42.480
Let's trace the victim's path. Maybe the
killer took the same one, okay? Good.

04:45.900 --> 04:46.985
Ready?

04:46.985 --> 04:48.903
Right behind you.
Let's go.

04:52.031 --> 04:56.202
We have what appears to be
glitter in the northwest quad.

04:58.538 --> 04:59.497
Path cleared?

05:00.248 --> 05:03.376
Door to the body, right there.

05:21.769 --> 05:22.812
Thanks.

05:25.064 --> 05:27.650
Cut hair ...
boys' clothes ...

05:27.650 --> 05:30.778
It's like he was disguising her,
maybe to smuggle her out.

05:43.499 --> 05:46.419
That means that he didn't plan
to kill her here, doesn't it?

05:48.504 --> 05:50.006
He was going to
take her with him.

05:50.006 --> 05:54.177
Something stopped the plan, didn't it?
Maybe she was screaming.

05:59.432 --> 06:01.225
Maybe the alarm system
here in the store.

06:01.517 --> 06:03.770
If it was the alarms we
could have a fish in the net.

06:05.438 --> 06:06.481
Not a fish.

06:07.315 --> 06:08.316
A shark.

06:43.601 --> 06:44.477
It's locked solid.

06:44.477 --> 06:45.687
Yeah, it's a storage room.

06:46.312 --> 06:49.273
Does this lead into Zany Town?

06:49.273 --> 06:51.150
No. No public access.

06:53.236 --> 06:56.114
You have gates,
so you must have protocol.

06:56.114 --> 06:58.700
Uh, each em ... em..., uh ...

06:58.700 --> 07:01.327
employee. ... Employee checks out
a different section of the store.

07:01.327 --> 07:03.746
I noticed stamps on people's hands.

07:04.455 --> 07:06.332
My own kids come here.

07:08.209 --> 07:09.252
Okay.

07:10.461 --> 07:13.339
I'm going to need you to calm down
'cause I need your help.

07:13.339 --> 07:14.966
Can you tell me about the stamps?

07:14.966 --> 07:16.259
K-k-k-K ... k-stamp, k-stamp.

07:16.259 --> 07:18.428
Kid check, kid check.

07:18.428 --> 07:21.556
You match the stamp on each child's hand to
the stamp on the accompanying adult?

07:22.098 --> 07:23.433
Okay, that's great.

07:25.018 --> 07:27.020
I don't even know how
we're going to start this.

07:28.062 --> 07:30.690
All right, people.
Listen up.

07:30.690 --> 07:33.943
We're crime scene investigators.
This is a very serious situation.

07:33.943 --> 07:35.987
We're going to need your full
cooperation.

07:35.987 --> 07:40.992
I need everybody to stay with their families.
Please watch your children.

07:40.992 --> 07:42.160
This is Officer Delko.

07:42.160 --> 07:44.245
He's going to take your fingerprints.

07:44.245 --> 07:49.083
I know you're all frightened and we're going to
try to get you home as fast as we can, okay?

07:49.083 --> 07:50.752
Thank you for your cooperation.

07:50.835 --> 07:56.049
Okay, I need everybody to just go ahead
get behind me form a single-file line.

07:56.466 --> 08:01.429
So, kids, please stay with your parents.
Parents, please, keep an eye on your children.

08:01.429 --> 08:04.057
Northeast quad is clear.
I'm going to dust.

08:04.390 --> 08:06.017
Glitter is Locard ...

08:08.936 --> 08:11.230
... but not from her clothes.

08:13.316 --> 08:14.567
What'd you get?

08:15.610 --> 08:18.237
Uh, automatic lock-up system.

08:18.237 --> 08:22.909
Windows barred doors gated.
Storage unit's on a keyed alarm.

08:22.909 --> 08:26.454
It's your basic kid playground turned
into a high-security prison.

08:26.454 --> 08:27.622
What about a crime kit?

08:27.622 --> 08:31.834
I've been overtly searching the
crowd subtly checking it out and ...

08:31.834 --> 08:33.836
I didn't see any abandoned
bags or backpacks.

08:33.836 --> 08:38.883
Well, maybe he stashed it. Ninety-nine
percent of all violent pedophiles are male.

08:38.883 --> 08:42.178
Speed, also add glitter transfer.
Okay?

08:42.178 --> 08:43.304
Yeah.

08:47.308 --> 08:48.434
This guy's a pro...

08:49.394 --> 08:52.855
prior planning, no witnesses.
He brought everything he needed.

08:52.855 --> 08:54.232
But he didn't get
everything he wanted.

08:54.232 --> 08:56.484
So he's probably very
frustrated right now.

08:56.484 --> 08:58.778
Means he's got to look
for another victim.

08:58.778 --> 09:00.613
Unless we get there first.

09:01.656 --> 09:04.325
The clothes ...
they've been worn.

09:04.325 --> 09:09.539
Where did he get them? From his own
family? Or more likely, he already had them.

09:09.998 --> 09:12.083
You ready?
Here we go.

09:16.838 --> 09:18.840
Affirmative on blood.

09:19.882 --> 09:22.635
Recycled from his last victim.

09:24.721 --> 09:27.223
All right. Step up, please.
I think it's the last one, man.

09:35.773 --> 09:37.150
Okay, you're clear.

09:39.527 --> 09:40.737
Excuse me.

09:40.737 --> 09:42.238
Yeah, can I help you?

09:42.238 --> 09:44.949
Look, I'm a third-year law
student from U.of M.

09:44.949 --> 09:45.867
Congratulations.

09:45.867 --> 09:48.077
And I know that it's illegal for
you guys to keep us here.

09:48.077 --> 09:49.537
You know what?
You're right, actually, but...

09:49.537 --> 09:53.333
as a human being, I think you have an
obligation to cooperate like everyone else.

09:53.333 --> 09:55.918
so why don't you get back in line
for me, okay? Thank you.

09:59.297 --> 10:02.133
Hey, is that true?
Can I go?

10:02.133 --> 10:04.218
No. Look.
No, you can't.

10:07.764 --> 10:10.141
You know why?
Because NOW you're a suspect.

10:10.141 --> 10:12.185
Go ahead and get
comfortable ... legally.

10:12.185 --> 10:13.895
Okay, let's go.

10:16.522 --> 10:17.565
Jackass.

10:32.246 --> 10:33.289
This lock is broken.

10:36.292 --> 10:38.670
So, how did he keep people out?
There's nothing ...

10:41.047 --> 10:42.090
wait a minute.

10:47.637 --> 10:49.722
Look at this.
"Out of order."

10:50.682 --> 10:52.767
This is how he
secured his privacy.

10:57.689 --> 10:59.732
So, how ...

10:59.732 --> 11:04.612
did a grown man steal a five-year-old girl
from a public place and nobody noticed?

11:04.737 --> 11:06.406
Maybe someone she trusted.

11:07.448 --> 11:08.700
Could be.

11:10.785 --> 11:13.955
Mrs. Crighton ...
you guys, um ...

11:13.955 --> 11:17.083
did you guys know anybody here?
Somebody she would have trusted?

11:18.835 --> 11:19.919
No.

11:21.879 --> 11:25.174
She was too good for this earth.

11:25.174 --> 11:27.885
Like an angel from heaven.

11:30.680 --> 11:35.893
Maybe that's not even her in that room.
How can you be so sure? Maybe she got out.

11:44.027 --> 11:45.069
I'm sorry.

11:54.996 --> 11:57.081
We're twins, mom!

12:10.970 --> 12:15.224
Facial edema and petechial hemorrhages
indicate raised venous pressure ...

12:15.224 --> 12:17.310
concurrent with asphyxia.

12:18.061 --> 12:21.105
The blue around her lips looks
so turquoise, Alexx.

12:21.105 --> 12:25.485
A little deoxygenated hemoglobin
is usually more purple blue.

12:25.485 --> 12:29.948
Cyanosis coloring is really subjective.
And, I mean, who knows under these lights.

12:30.198 --> 12:31.491
Why no bruises?

12:31.491 --> 12:36.329
Ecchymosis can take up to twenty-four
hours to fully develop, but, yeah...

12:36.329 --> 12:38.831
we should see at least
minimal erythema...

12:38.831 --> 12:42.835
if she was strangled or ruptured capillaries
around  her mouth if she was smothered and ....

12:42.835 --> 12:44.921
I see neither.

12:45.588 --> 12:46.965
So how did he kill her?

12:50.093 --> 12:51.928
Don't shoot the messenger, Horatio,

12:51.928 --> 12:55.556
but the brass is leaning, helicopters are
starting to hover and reporters are starting to ...

12:55.556 --> 12:56.766
Okay.
Give me a minute, please.

12:57.809 --> 12:58.685
Horatio ...

12:58.685 --> 12:59.894
Yeah?

12:59.894 --> 13:01.646
Your killer took a souvenir.

13:03.398 --> 13:04.524
How do you mean?

13:06.609 --> 13:08.152
Her underwear.

13:17.787 --> 13:20.123
Lieutenant Caine ...
what information have you learned so far?

13:20.123 --> 13:22.917
Have you detained a suspect?
Can we get some questions over here?

13:23.668 --> 13:25.086
Lieutenant Caine, is it true she was raped?

13:25.086 --> 13:27.171
Is there any indication that the
killer will strike again soon?

13:27.171 --> 13:31.801
I'm not going to comment on evidence,
but what I will say is that this animal ...

13:31.801 --> 13:37.015
has provided us with a mountain of evidence and we will not
sleep till we've been all the way through it because we know

13:38.057 --> 13:42.812
that beneath that mountain lies his grave.
Thank you very much.

13:42.812 --> 13:45.690
Lieutenant Caine, questions over here!
Lieutenant Caine, some questions!

13:49.275 --> 13:52.362
I don't want you giving Tiger
any more potato chips.

13:52.362 --> 13:55.615
They're not good for kitties, okay?

13:55.615 --> 13:58.743
And have daddy read you a story tonight.
No TV.

14:00.120 --> 14:03.248
Yeah. I love you, too, baby.

14:13.591 --> 14:14.842
Hey, Alexx.

14:14.842 --> 14:15.968
Hey.

14:15.968 --> 14:18.930
I got the results of the
blue tinge on her lips...

14:18.930 --> 14:24.143
- diglucose and propylene glycol, aka:
Good, old-fashioned candy.

14:25.686 --> 14:27.397
Could be how he lured her.

14:27.397 --> 14:28.523
Come on.

14:29.232 --> 14:34.445
Not very inventive,
but effective and sticky as hell.

14:43.204 --> 14:44.247
Whoa.

14:45.790 --> 14:48.918
Whoa. What's that?

14:49.752 --> 14:50.795
A fingerprint?

15:47.143 --> 15:50.354
She's talking to someone but
whoever it is stayed off camera.

15:51.397 --> 15:54.525
He must have surveilled the place.
He knew how to stay out of sight.

15:55.818 --> 15:56.694
Where are you?

15:56.694 --> 15:59.739
I'm walking towards the bathroom.

15:59.739 --> 16:01.366
Okay, I don't see you ...

16:01.366 --> 16:05.078
I don't see you ... hello, handsome.
I see your hand.

16:05.078 --> 16:10.291
I am passing the bowling pin display where
the toys are mounted on the wall.

16:10.833 --> 16:12.293
How far is she from the shelf?

16:12.293 --> 16:13.378
About three feet.

16:14.128 --> 16:15.713
You couldn't see me.

16:15.713 --> 16:18.549
This is exactly the route he took.
It's perfect.

16:19.133 --> 16:20.176
Straight to the bathroom.

16:21.177 --> 16:25.556
In order to avoid the camera he had
to stay off the beaten path.

16:26.432 --> 16:27.975
It's worse to be seen.

16:29.435 --> 16:33.439
Yes, but the better to
see his footprint.

16:34.482 --> 16:36.359
That's our last lifter.

16:36.359 --> 16:37.402
And more in the van.

16:46.411 --> 16:48.079
Oh, that's juicy.

16:48.079 --> 16:50.164
Yes, it is.

16:56.504 --> 16:57.547
That's a beauty.

17:05.346 --> 17:06.597
No match?

17:07.013 --> 17:10.017
You're kidding. I thought for
sure this guy'd be a repeat.

17:12.103 --> 17:15.272
No wonder.
This print's all screwed up.

17:15.272 --> 17:17.525
Yeah, you're right.
There's no central pocket loop.

17:17.525 --> 17:19.527
Well, human skin is
an elastic surface.

17:19.527 --> 17:22.280
Maybe the print got stretched
when we moved her.

17:22.280 --> 17:24.531
Maybe we're not looking
at one finger.

17:26.325 --> 17:29.662
Maybe we're looking at a cross-section
of a couple different fingers.

17:29.954 --> 17:32.373
Get some rest.
You guys get home safely. Thank you.

17:33.416 --> 17:35.251
Gary, thanks, buddy.

17:37.336 --> 17:40.006
Print results came back.
Not one prior.

17:40.006 --> 17:42.675
Not even a traffic ticket
except for four people.

17:42.675 --> 17:43.718
Records?

17:43.718 --> 17:45.887
No, they just refused to give prints.

17:45.887 --> 17:49.515
What about that guy in the
Acapulco T-shirt? Did he give prints?

17:49.515 --> 17:51.976
No, but you think we
could arrest him...

17:51.976 --> 17:55.521
based on the fact that it's a little too creepy
to be in one of these places without a kid?

17:55.521 --> 17:58.274
Could you hold my lifters?
Do you have any ridge builder lotion?

17:58.274 --> 17:59.650
Yeah, in my kit.

18:22.840 --> 18:25.093
Hi, I'm Calleigh Duquesne.

18:25.927 --> 18:26.969
Hi, Brad Repkin.

18:28.012 --> 18:29.764
Oh, let me get that for you.

18:31.849 --> 18:33.726
Your last name is Repkin.

18:33.726 --> 18:35.186
Yeah, Repkin.

18:40.233 --> 18:41.776
Here you go.

18:42.819 --> 18:43.820
Very nice.

18:43.820 --> 18:46.531
Do you mind taking my footprints
back to the lab while you're at it?

18:46.531 --> 18:47.990
No, I don't.

18:47.990 --> 18:49.117
That door is open.

18:49.117 --> 18:50.660
A service entrance.

18:51.703 --> 18:53.830
It looks unbarred, too.

18:53.830 --> 18:55.623
You need a code to get through it.

18:57.709 --> 18:59.794
Who has access to the code?

18:59.794 --> 19:03.965
According to the manager
himself and six other employees.

19:03.965 --> 19:07.301
Two that were on shift and
four we had to pull in.

19:09.053 --> 19:11.222
We looked at 'em real hard
and they all checked out.

19:11.222 --> 19:12.265
I'm sure they did.

19:18.020 --> 19:18.938
You page me?

19:18.938 --> 19:21.232
Yeah.
Got broken ribs.

19:21.232 --> 19:24.402
Five and six on the right consistent
with the blood in her mouth.

19:24.402 --> 19:25.653
Hemothorax?

19:26.195 --> 19:29.949
Cracked rib punctured her lungs,
her lungs filled with blood.

19:31.951 --> 19:35.913
She was probably fighting him.
So the monster got on top of her.

19:35.913 --> 19:41.127
Crushing her chest. Cause of death:
Positional asphyxiation.

19:41.919 --> 19:44.130
No. Intentional evil.

19:45.173 --> 19:46.132
What you got?

19:46.132 --> 19:49.010
I wasn't expecting anything
unusual, but ...

19:49.010 --> 19:50.845
Butalbital.

19:51.888 --> 19:54.849
He gave her barbiturates
with her candy.

19:54.849 --> 19:57.727
Butalbital's a fast-acting sedative.

19:57.727 --> 20:01.314
Wouldn't take a lot to knock a
child out almost immediately.

20:01.314 --> 20:02.815
But what about signs of a struggle?

20:02.815 --> 20:04.692
Found something else.

20:04.692 --> 20:06.569
Antihistamine?

20:06.569 --> 20:08.654
Poor baby had a cold.

20:08.654 --> 20:12.200
She wasn't struggling.
She was convulsing.

20:12.200 --> 20:14.827
Antihistamine is contra-indicated
with butalbital.

20:15.870 --> 20:17.789
She went into anaphylactic shock.

20:18.831 --> 20:19.957
Oh, god.

20:20.875 --> 20:23.169
This means he wasn't
trying to restrain her.

20:23.503 --> 20:25.797
He was trying to revive her.

20:27.131 --> 20:30.802
CPR, when applied with too
much force, can crack ribs.

20:34.806 --> 20:36.891
He wanted his time with her.

21:10.550 --> 21:13.678
Hey, H, we got someone looking
pretty sweet over there.

21:13.678 --> 21:15.012
Mr. Acapulco?

21:15.012 --> 21:17.098
Yeah, real hard to get out of here.

21:17.098 --> 21:21.060
He's got glitter on his shirt no
ID and refused to give us prints.

21:21.060 --> 21:22.145
I got 'em anyway.

21:22.145 --> 21:23.855
Delko just called from the print lab.

21:23.855 --> 21:26.190
This guy's a registered sex
offender.

21:26.190 --> 21:30.945
Hmm ... okay. Get Bernstein.
Where is he?

21:31.279 --> 21:32.447
He's right there.

21:32.447 --> 21:33.865
Brad Repkin?

21:34.907 --> 21:35.783
Yeah?

21:35.783 --> 21:37.827
Hands out of your pockets,
behind your back.

21:40.329 --> 21:41.831
You got a car, Brad?

21:43.624 --> 21:45.877
Yeah. Outside.

21:45.877 --> 21:47.253
Let's go take a look.

21:48.296 --> 21:49.005
Which one is it?

21:49.005 --> 21:50.256
It's the green cadillac.

21:50.256 --> 21:51.174
Right here?
Yeah.

21:51.174 --> 21:52.008
Green caddy?

21:52.008 --> 21:55.094
Yeah. You can't search it, can you?
I mean, I got rights, don't I?

21:55.094 --> 21:56.179
Just shut up, Brad.

21:56.179 --> 21:58.389
You violated your parole when you came
within a hundred yards of a child.

21:58.389 --> 22:00.683
You know the rules, so shut up.

22:20.953 --> 22:22.622
This better not be hers.

22:28.751 --> 22:32.797
I understand that you did quite a bit of
time in solitary on your first conviction.

22:32.797 --> 22:36.801
That was a bogus charge.
My bitch ex-wife -- she ruined my life.

22:36.801 --> 22:40.763
But your daughter made a statement that
you touched her during a swimming lesson.

22:40.763 --> 22:43.641
That's not true.
I would never hurt her.

22:43.641 --> 22:48.396
See, I think, on this conviction the cons
are going to get you before the chair does.

22:48.396 --> 22:54.652
Did you know that they kill child molesters in
prison before the rapists before the serial killers?

22:54.652 --> 22:56.029
Did you know that?

22:57.113 --> 22:58.823
Look, you don't have anything on me.

22:58.823 --> 23:02.869
I've got footprints, I've got glitter.
I've got your record,

23:02.869 --> 23:04.370
and I'm about to
match a fingerprint.

23:04.370 --> 23:09.584
I was going to take my daughter, okay?
That's it. It's my visiting day.

23:11.002 --> 23:14.130
But instead, you picked up
a substitute, didn't you?

23:21.971 --> 23:24.057
Where are you, you perv?

23:37.237 --> 23:38.279
Sit tight.

23:42.534 --> 23:43.660
Horatio?
Yeah?

23:43.660 --> 23:47.288
He was playing pocket pull just
before the alarms went full blast.

23:47.288 --> 23:49.666
On camera the whole time.

23:51.125 --> 23:52.752
On camera the whole time.

23:53.461 --> 23:56.297
But he still violated parole.
He is still going back to prison.

23:56.297 --> 23:58.675
He is not our guy, then.

24:00.802 --> 24:05.807
Do you know how many children a pedophile
molests during a lifetime on average?

24:05.807 --> 24:06.933
No.

24:06.933 --> 24:12.146
Well, a recent study says 150.
One hundred and fifty.

24:13.398 --> 24:14.482
What if they're caught?

24:14.482 --> 24:16.276
Down to 65.

24:18.361 --> 24:20.864
Then we can still save 85 children.

24:24.742 --> 24:26.077
Let's work for that.

24:27.745 --> 24:29.289
Okay, here comes the magic.

24:39.932 --> 24:43.102
Yeah, got broken ridges running
in all directions. Just like ...

24:43.102 --> 24:44.937
... the cotton candy fingerprint.

24:44.937 --> 24:45.980
Exactly.

24:52.778 --> 24:55.489
That makes three
fingers out of five.

24:56.532 --> 24:59.035
Let's hope he left the
rest right here.

25:48.584 --> 25:50.294
Look at this middle finger.

25:50.294 --> 25:53.965
I mean, there's no arches,
no whorls, no loops.

25:54.507 --> 25:56.342
It's all dots and bifurcations.

25:56.342 --> 25:58.761
But the index has
three radial loops on it.

25:58.761 --> 26:03.349
Malcolm X held the previous record
with two radial loops on one hand.

26:04.892 --> 26:09.063
Well, it isn't a bunch of cuts because those
would just break up otherwise fluid ridges.

26:12.191 --> 26:16.362
It's not a chemical burn. The ridges
would be worn evenly on the hand.

26:20.992 --> 26:25.163
Well, it can't be a scar because the
skin would heal back into the print.

26:26.539 --> 26:30.334
It looks scarred.
It looks like dozens of scars.

26:30.334 --> 26:34.505
It looks like he reached into a blender.
I don't know.

26:41.804 --> 26:42.889
Calleigh?

26:44.682 --> 26:47.476
Oh, my god. I'm so sorry.
I closed my eyes just for a second.

26:47.476 --> 26:49.520
Don't worry about it.
You're a morning person.

26:49.520 --> 26:51.189
Horatio, I don't know
what happened.

26:51.189 --> 26:54.567
You're fine. Do me a favor and
take a look at subject B...

26:54.567 --> 26:57.695
and tell me if you see
anything peculiar about it.

26:58.696 --> 27:00.490
His weight's all in the back.

27:00.781 --> 27:05.077
See, normally when someone takes a
step it's heel, ball, toe. Correct?

27:05.703 --> 27:08.956
But in this case there's pressure
on the arch and not the toe.

27:08.956 --> 27:11.042
Are you thinking his shoes
are too big for his feet?

27:11.042 --> 27:15.379
When someone takes the time to put on a
pair of shoes that are three sizes too large ...

27:15.379 --> 27:17.882
it can mean that they're trying
to hide their identity.

27:17.882 --> 27:19.842
Just like he did with cameras.

27:19.842 --> 27:23.095
You know, subject B's steps
peter out near the storage room.

27:24.138 --> 27:27.558
Okay, and we have trace soil
on the fourth print, don't we?

27:28.643 --> 27:31.437
Good. What would you
like in your coffee?

27:31.646 --> 27:33.022
Sugar.

27:35.107 --> 27:36.192
How he got in!

27:36.943 --> 27:38.319
What?

27:41.447 --> 27:45.576
The glitter found on Ruthie is a match to
the glitter found on the Zany Town vest.

27:45.576 --> 27:47.829
He must have stolen one.
That's how he got in.

27:47.829 --> 27:50.832
Probably how he got out, too.
Okay, let's get Bernstein.

27:50.832 --> 27:52.500
This guy probably knows
an employee there.

27:53.251 --> 27:56.254
Okay, so you're a complete pro.
You know exactly what you're doing.

27:56.254 --> 28:00.174
'Cause you've done it before.
You've got a record, you've been to jail.

28:00.174 --> 28:03.928
That's right. So, to escape Megan's law,
no pun intended...

28:03.928 --> 28:07.598
and avoid having the neighborhood
know where the local pedophile lives...

28:07.598 --> 28:10.726
you decide to take someone else's prints
and cover your own with them.

28:11.602 --> 28:14.605
But that wouldn't work,
though because they'd fall off.

28:15.147 --> 28:16.190
Frankenstein.

28:16.983 --> 28:21.571
He Frankenstein'd himself. He took his own
skin off and put them on different fingers.

28:22.989 --> 28:24.615
And we could still match that to something?

28:24.615 --> 28:29.203
Not if he sliced them into small pieces
first and then grafted them back on.

28:35.418 --> 28:40.298
There are 2,500 nerve receptors
in the finger per centimeter.

28:40.298 --> 28:41.132
That must have hurt like a bitch.

28:41.132 --> 28:43.718
Yeah, that's how badly
he wants these kids.

28:44.760 --> 28:49.557
So, he rejiggered his fingerprints thinking
that he could avoid his previous crimes.

28:49.557 --> 28:51.225
He was almost right.

28:51.225 --> 28:56.480
AFIS didn't find it, but we cut up his prints and
figure out where the pieces actually go ...

28:58.399 --> 29:00.359
Like a human jigsaw puzzle.

29:00.359 --> 29:01.402
Let's go.

29:01.819 --> 29:05.156
Did you know the glitter found on
Ruthie's body came from Zany Town?

29:05.156 --> 29:07.450
It couldn't have been an employee.

29:07.450 --> 29:08.784
Nobody with a record can work there.

29:08.784 --> 29:12.705
The killer had the code to your
storage room. Explain that, please.

29:12.705 --> 29:13.998
I don't know.

29:14.624 --> 29:15.750
Where do you keep it?

29:15.750 --> 29:16.751
On my desk.

29:16.751 --> 29:20.421
On your desk?
In plain view for everyone to see?

29:20.421 --> 29:21.297
Oh, my god.

29:21.297 --> 29:22.757
That's using your head.

29:23.508 --> 29:25.426
I am so sorry.

29:28.554 --> 29:32.016
All right, we need a
bifurcation with dots.

29:32.850 --> 29:35.645
Okay, uh ...
bifurcation with dots.

29:38.523 --> 29:39.774
Here, try this.

29:43.611 --> 29:44.654
Not it.

29:50.368 --> 29:53.496
Okay ... all right. Try that one. That
has some whorls in it.

30:01.128 --> 30:04.340
Okay.
How about an ulnar loop?

30:05.383 --> 30:06.425
Right here.

30:13.349 --> 30:14.684
Yeah ... yeah ... yeah, that's it.

30:15.726 --> 30:16.936
Yes, it is.

30:18.479 --> 30:19.981
You were waiting for that, huh?

30:20.398 --> 30:21.482
Beautiful.

30:25.570 --> 30:30.783
Papilio aristodemus
ponceanus and torchwood.

30:31.367 --> 30:36.581
Translation: The dirt that you found on subject
b's shoes was full of swallowtail eggs.

30:38.457 --> 30:40.960
Book says swallowtails are
a really rare butterfly.

30:40.960 --> 30:44.172
Only three have been seen in Biscayne
National Park in the last four years.

30:44.172 --> 30:45.214
I need a map.

30:49.760 --> 30:51.804
Horatio?
Yeah?

30:51.804 --> 30:53.347
Got a print match and a name.

30:53.347 --> 30:58.561
Stewart Otis. Registered pedophile,
long record starting at age 12.

30:59.353 --> 31:00.980
All we need is an address.

31:02.565 --> 31:04.650
Damn it. No Stewart Otis.

31:04.650 --> 31:07.570
Right, but if he changed his prints there's
a chance he changed his name.

31:07.570 --> 31:10.448
So, Bob, let's do a property
search for the name Otis.

31:10.448 --> 31:15.661
Anything in or around Biscayne
National Park. Let's do that.

31:15.953 --> 31:20.541
Look at this. We have a match. William
and Margaret Otis. 2430 Black Creek Road.

31:20.541 --> 31:23.169
That's a quarter mile from the park.
Let's go.

31:31.969 --> 31:32.929
No one inside, sir.

31:32.929 --> 31:37.517
Okay. House is clear! Glove up!
Kits and gloves! Let's go.

32:14.095 --> 32:16.180
Well, he's not shy about
his pornography.

32:27.733 --> 32:29.402
This is just the tip of the iceberg.

32:43.457 --> 32:44.834
And he doesn't live here.

32:45.251 --> 32:46.294
He plays here.

33:44.727 --> 33:46.103
What do you got here?

33:47.980 --> 33:50.608
I don't know. These cartons--
he must have ...

33:50.608 --> 33:54.362
he must keep them like some
sick kind of trading cards.

34:00.159 --> 34:01.702
They're not trading cards.

34:03.454 --> 34:04.997
They're headstones.

34:16.306 --> 34:18.893
That makes four and one partial.

34:18.893 --> 34:22.813
I'll call the office and get an autopsy
room prepped for the remains.

34:22.813 --> 34:26.525
At this point, closure's the only thing we
can give these families.

34:26.525 --> 34:28.610
Until we catch this guy.

34:36.953 --> 34:37.995
Alexx!

34:39.330 --> 34:40.665
Hey, Alexx!

34:44.293 --> 34:45.585
What do you think?

34:47.672 --> 34:51.259
Sandy soil minimizes decomposition.

34:51.259 --> 34:56.472
There's marbling ...
... but very little skin slip.

34:56.806 --> 34:58.599
The soil is cool.

34:58.891 --> 35:02.395
Well, I'd say she's been here three,
maybe four weeks.

35:02.395 --> 35:05.857
So he's not even waiting a
month between kills, is he?

35:05.857 --> 35:09.360
Well, don't serial killers
accelerate as they progress?

35:09.360 --> 35:12.238
Yes, they do, and that's
when they make mistakes.

35:12.572 --> 35:15.158
Maybe you can tell us
some of them, angel.

35:31.215 --> 35:33.551
That's from the little girl we
dug up at the house.

35:35.219 --> 35:37.138
Is that blood?
Yep.

35:38.598 --> 35:41.350
This freak ...
plays with them like toys.

35:42.185 --> 35:45.813
Until they break.
Keep me posted.

36:23.351 --> 36:25.645
Speed... what do we got?

36:26.687 --> 36:31.901
Carbon, oxygen and hydrogen
combo and propylene glycol ...

36:31.984 --> 36:33.778
sugar and blue dye #1.

36:33.778 --> 36:35.488
Well, there's our cotton candy.

36:35.488 --> 36:37.115
How did it get on her underwear?

36:37.115 --> 36:39.158
I thought he just used it to lure
them and to drug them.

36:39.158 --> 36:42.995
Well, with no presence of butalbital
maybe he has another use for it.

36:55.383 --> 37:00.596
These crystals aren't elongated.
They're square. Not fibrous.

37:01.389 --> 37:03.182
Meaning?

37:03.182 --> 37:06.102
Meaning they haven't
been exposed to heat.

37:07.145 --> 37:08.730
Like a cotton candy machine.

37:08.730 --> 37:11.607
Exactly.
This is unprocessed cotton candy.

37:11.941 --> 37:16.112
So he makes the stuff. Let's find out
where he's delivering today.

37:22.618 --> 37:23.661
Thank you.

37:32.670 --> 37:33.796
Hey, Stewart.

37:34.630 --> 37:35.506
Yeah.

37:35.506 --> 37:37.341
How's the cotton candy business?

37:38.092 --> 37:40.803
You move, he's going to put
one right through you.

37:43.806 --> 37:45.892
Those must've been painful.

37:51.773 --> 37:52.899
Nice work.

37:55.902 --> 37:59.614
What do we have here,
stolen uniforms?

37:59.614 --> 38:03.284
"Sir golf-a-lot." You on to
your next victim, Stewart?

38:05.119 --> 38:06.120
That's not mine.

38:06.120 --> 38:09.123
Really? Whose is it, mine?
Take him.

38:09.749 --> 38:11.209
Let's go.

38:19.133 --> 38:24.347
We, um ... we located ...
your stash of pornography, Stewart.

38:26.432 --> 38:31.020
And, uh, I've got to tell you
that's pretty sick stuff.

38:33.356 --> 38:34.649
Pornography?

38:37.652 --> 38:42.865
It's my guess that you couldn't
come by the real thing...

38:43.408 --> 38:48.079
and so you put on your phony uniform and
you went trolling for a little girl.

39:00.675 --> 39:02.760
Mom, watch me!

39:06.389 --> 39:09.892
Mommy, I'm hot.
All right. Back you go.

39:13.438 --> 39:15.523
She was flirting with me.

39:24.490 --> 39:25.825
Whoops-a-daisy.

39:46.763 --> 39:48.264
She ruined it.

39:49.807 --> 39:52.560
It's called anaphylactic shock.

39:52.560 --> 39:56.397
Your sedative mixed with
her cold medicine.

39:57.648 --> 39:59.150
Come on. What are you doing?

39:59.150 --> 40:02.904
Stop it! Stop it. Come on!

40:02.904 --> 40:03.946
What's wrong with you?

40:25.301 --> 40:27.387
I never even got to play with her.

40:35.937 --> 40:37.980
Life ...

40:37.980 --> 40:40.066
Stewart ...

40:40.066 --> 40:42.151
is filled ...

40:42.151 --> 40:44.445
with disappointment.

40:46.531 --> 40:50.159
"...And Hansel, who liked the taste of the roof, ...

40:50.159 --> 40:54.038
... tore down a great piece of it.

40:59.794 --> 41:03.339
Suddenly ... the door opened...

41:08.302 --> 41:10.388
Keep going, mommy.

41:21.566 --> 41:23.651
I want to talk to you guys ...

41:25.987 --> 41:28.364
about bad people.

41:51.137 --> 41:56.184
/Don't think about all those things you fear/

41:59.771 --> 42:02.899
/just be glad to be here/

42:04.734 --> 42:09.739
/don't think about all those things you fear/

42:13.326 --> 42:16.037
/just be glad to be here./
