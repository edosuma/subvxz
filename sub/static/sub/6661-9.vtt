AROUND, SAM.

39:44.913 --> 39:47.385
YEAH. NICE MEETING YOU.

39:51.660 --> 39:53.492
HEY, MIMI...

39:53.492 --> 39:55.764
HOW--HOW LONG WAS IT
THAT YOU'VE KNOWN JERRY?

39:55.764 --> 39:58.126
OOF, ON AND OFF,
MORE THAN 20 YEARS,

39:58.126 --> 40:00.669
LONG TIME.
BUT THAT'S ALL BEHIND ME.

40:00.669 --> 40:03.131
I'M STARTING A NEW LIFE.

40:10.178 --> 40:12.080
Ben: THE DEVIL
HAS A CHILD.

40:12.080 --> 40:16.915
YOU KNOW, I NEVER THOUGHT
THAT THE DEVIL HAD GENITALS.

40:16.915 --> 40:18.447
WHAT, LIKE A KEN DOLL?

40:18.447 --> 40:20.949
I DON'T THINK
SHE'S HIS DAUGHTER.

40:20.949 --> 40:21.950
SHE'S REALLY NICE.

40:21.950 --> 40:23.592
I DON'T KNOW, SAM.
I DON'T LIKE IT.

40:23.592 --> 40:26.124
THIS SATAN'S TRYING
TO GET YOU TO HOOK UP
WITH HIS DAUGHTER.

40:26.124 --> 40:28.797
YOU KNOW, I BET
SHE WANTS YOUR MAN SEED.

40:28.797 --> 40:29.658
WHAT? NO.

40:29.658 --> 40:30.599
YEAH, SURE, THINK ABOUT IT.

40:30.599 --> 40:32.100
YOU KNOCKED HER UP,
RIGHT, THEN THE DEVIL

40:32.100 --> 40:33.502
HAS A LITTLE SAM BABY
RUNNING AROUND

40:33.502 --> 40:35.464
CATCHING SOULS FOR HIM
WHEN HE GROWS UP.

40:35.464 --> 40:37.435
AFTER, YOU KNOW,
YOU KICK.

40:37.435 --> 40:41.109
WHICH I HOPE WILL NOT BE
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

40:41.109 --> 40:44.172
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I THINK I'M GOING
TO GIVE CADY A CALL.

40:44.172 --> 40:46.444
HMM. WHAT ABOUT ANDI?

40:46.444 --> 40:49.948
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT HAVE I BEEN
HANGING ONTO,

40:49.948 --> 40:50.879
A GLIMMER OF HOPE?

40:50.879 --> 40:55.123
I COULD WAIT FOREVER
AND MISS OUT ON
LIVING MY LIFE.

40:56.224 --> 40:58.156
LET'S DO THIS.

40:58.156 --> 40:59.658
YEP, LET'S DO IT.

40:59.658 --> 41:01.530
NOW.

41:03.191 --> 41:05.494
IS IT WRONG,
WHAT WE'RE DOING?

41:05.494 --> 41:07.235
HUH? NO, NO.
MAN, WE'RE HEROES.

41:07.235 --> 41:08.136
IT'S TOTALLY COOL.

41:08.136 --> 41:10.599
Sam: WE SHOULD
SAY SOMETHING.

41:10.599 --> 41:12.901
WE SAVED
YOUR FAMILIES

41:12.901 --> 41:15.804
FROM A GIANT
ASH MONSTER.

41:15.804 --> 41:17.576
YOU'RE WELCOME.

41:17.576 --> 41:18.607
AMEN.

41:18.607 --> 41:20.008
THAT WAS NICE.

41:20.008 --> 41:22.210
THANK YOU.
