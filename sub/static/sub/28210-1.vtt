<i>I have the honor today to introduce you</i>

00:29.838 --> 00:32.130
<i>to Retired Captain William Miller.</i>

00:32.588 --> 00:35.338
<i>He's been everywhere in the world
you all wanna go...</i>

00:35.546 --> 00:37.380
<i>and a bunch of places you don't.</i>

00:38.088 --> 00:40.171
I've asked him to come
and talk to you all today

00:40.255 --> 00:42.713
at this important crossroad
in your careers.

00:42.796 --> 00:45.713
I'm gonna step out
so this conversation can be frank

00:46.171 --> 00:47.255
and to the point.

00:59.963 --> 01:03.171
About five years ago,
when I was on leave...

01:04.671 --> 01:08.546
...I found myself standing in the middle
of the cereal aisle at the Publix...

01:09.213 --> 01:12.755
with my arm around some guy's throat.

01:14.421 --> 01:16.671
I was squeezing so hard he pissed himself.

01:17.963 --> 01:20.671
My fiancée at the time had to climb
on my back

01:20.755 --> 01:22.755
just so I didn't actually kill the guy.

01:24.213 --> 01:26.005
Do you know why I was doing this?

01:27.630 --> 01:29.921
Because he hadn't moved his cart
when I asked.

01:31.588 --> 01:33.088
I was the best of the best,

01:34.796 --> 01:37.838
able to shut down, control, manipulate...

01:38.588 --> 01:41.671
all basic human instincts
towards one goal:

01:44.088 --> 01:45.671
the completion of my mission.

01:47.588 --> 01:52.088
But the effects of committing
extreme violence on other human beings

01:52.213 --> 01:53.338
are biological

01:54.463 --> 01:55.838
and physiological.

01:57.755 --> 01:59.713
That's the price of being a warrior.

02:27.380 --> 02:29.130
<i>Is everything clear in the valley?</i>

02:29.671 --> 02:30.963
Affirmative!

02:31.046 --> 02:32.213
<i>Copy that.</i>

02:32.296 --> 02:33.630
Enter, enter, enter!

02:34.171 --> 02:35.255
<i>Let's go!</i>

04:33.046 --> 04:34.421
<i>Enter, enter, enter.</i>

04:57.963 --> 05:00.171
<i>Let me inform you</i>

05:00.255 --> 05:02.005
<i>that we have you surrounded.</i>

05:02.755 --> 05:04.421
So, put down your weapons,

05:04.505 --> 05:06.046
come out of the building

05:06.505 --> 05:09.421
<i>with your hands behind your head.</i>

05:25.130 --> 05:27.005
How many did you say were in there?

05:27.380 --> 05:28.505
No more than ten.

05:46.380 --> 05:47.463
No, no, no!

05:52.338 --> 05:54.338
You guys hold this position.

05:54.838 --> 05:56.796
We're going to find other cover.

05:56.880 --> 05:57.963
But hold here.

05:58.630 --> 05:59.463
Good.

06:00.588 --> 06:01.421
Rodriguez!

06:01.671 --> 06:03.921
Rodriguez, can you hold your position?

06:07.255 --> 06:08.463
<i>Rodriguez!</i>

06:09.421 --> 06:10.713
Fuck no!

06:10.796 --> 06:12.046
<i>We need to get back.</i>

06:12.130 --> 06:14.421
I said, maintain your positions.

06:14.505 --> 06:17.088
<i>- Hold on!</i>
- Move him! Move him!

06:34.380 --> 06:35.463
Rodriguez?

06:35.546 --> 06:36.713
Rodriguez?

06:40.213 --> 06:41.463
<i>Rodriguez!</i>

06:42.213 --> 06:43.171
Diego!

06:43.255 --> 06:44.171
<i>Hold on!</i>

07:04.088 --> 07:04.921
Advance.

07:08.130 --> 07:09.296
Nice shot.

07:29.838 --> 07:35.171
I'm so tired of arresting all of you

07:35.463 --> 07:37.755
only to simply find you all here again.

07:39.046 --> 07:42.171
Oh, my adviser is here.

07:42.671 --> 07:43.630
Ready, brother?

07:44.546 --> 07:46.463
America is listening.

07:47.046 --> 07:48.713
Take the money, brother.

07:48.796 --> 07:50.171
It's $400,000.

07:50.338 --> 07:51.380
You lose nothing.

07:51.755 --> 07:54.005
I already have the money.

07:54.088 --> 07:57.380
And... and Lorea?

08:05.380 --> 08:06.796
What was it that you said?

08:09.921 --> 08:13.046
Now you're turning on your own boss?

08:14.338 --> 08:15.546
I know where he is.

08:15.630 --> 08:17.046
Fucking snitch. Shh!

08:18.588 --> 08:19.880
Where's that?

08:20.338 --> 08:22.130
In Mexico? Disneyland?

08:22.213 --> 08:23.046
Where?

08:23.671 --> 08:24.588
No, no.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.588
He's hiding in the jungle, my brother.

08:27.046 --> 08:30.505
He went there
because he doesn't trust banks

08:30.588 --> 08:32.880
or any of those things anymore.

08:34.630 --> 08:37.130
Sir, you could find him.

08:37.755 --> 08:39.671
You just got yourself killed, fucker.

08:39.755 --> 08:40.630
Silence!

08:47.630 --> 08:49.463
Lift up, lift up your little face.

08:50.921 --> 08:52.463
Is this guy telling me the truth?

09:27.838 --> 09:32.755
Does anyone else out here want to try
to assault a police officer?

09:34.505 --> 09:38.005
Or tell fairy tales about Mr. Lorea?

09:39.046 --> 09:39.921
Huh?

09:41.963 --> 09:43.296
Take them to the trucks.

09:58.338 --> 10:01.005
I'll go after her.

10:01.505 --> 10:03.213
Get up there with the bikes, now!

10:13.046 --> 10:14.380
Move! Move!

11:05.255 --> 11:08.505
<i>Santiago? Santiago?</i>

11:11.213 --> 11:12.963
<i>Santiago, where are you?</i>

11:13.421 --> 11:14.546
Yes, Diego?

11:16.796 --> 11:18.005
I don't know where I am.

11:18.963 --> 11:21.005
But she escaped. I lost her.

12:21.963 --> 12:24.880
- What were you doing there?
- Warning my brother.

12:24.963 --> 12:25.796
Jesus.

12:26.088 --> 12:27.713
You said it was going down at noon,

12:27.796 --> 12:29.546
- and it's ten fucking thirty.
- It wasn't my bust.

12:29.630 --> 12:32.046
- It was never my bust.
- He changed it.

12:32.171 --> 12:33.963
- They took him?
- I don't know.

12:34.046 --> 12:36.213
They took my brother,
and you have to get him out.

12:36.880 --> 12:38.088
- Get him out?
- Yes.

12:38.171 --> 12:39.963
You're lucky he's still alive.

12:40.255 --> 12:41.963
But he won't be alive for very long.

12:42.046 --> 12:44.671
You never should've let
your idiot brother get involved

12:44.755 --> 12:45.588
with this shit.

12:50.713 --> 12:52.296
What if I told you I know?

12:55.671 --> 12:57.088
I know where Lorea is.

12:58.296 --> 12:59.671
I know where the money is.

13:05.671 --> 13:07.046
How long have you known?

13:08.296 --> 13:09.338
Three months.

13:11.421 --> 13:12.963
And why wouldn't you tell me that?

13:13.796 --> 13:15.630
Because I'm just your informant, right?

13:16.380 --> 13:17.546
That's all I am?

13:21.880 --> 13:24.755
If you've got something to tell me,
right now is the time to do it.

13:25.088 --> 13:25.921
I...

13:28.005 --> 13:29.255
was given a promotion.

13:31.046 --> 13:32.796
I deliver vans full of money...

13:33.338 --> 13:34.921
to Lorea's house in the jungle.

13:35.505 --> 13:36.880
That's where he keeps the money.

13:36.963 --> 13:38.838
His house is a safe.

13:40.338 --> 13:41.671
And just so you know,

13:42.255 --> 13:46.046
Lorea pays Diego and all of those men
that hired you way too much money.

13:47.630 --> 13:50.046
They've just been watching you
chase your tail.

13:51.130 --> 13:56.171
But now, maybe,
you can actually do something.

14:16.380 --> 14:20.380
Your government has put a lot of time,
money, and training into all of you,

14:21.546 --> 14:23.921
and it does not want to lose
that investment.

14:24.755 --> 14:26.380
Over the next few weeks,

14:26.463 --> 14:30.838
you will be bombarded with offers
to take your skill set and use them

14:30.921 --> 14:32.546
in the private sector.

14:34.463 --> 14:36.505
I was suckered into the same thing.

14:37.713 --> 14:39.255
That's what I'm here to say,

14:39.921 --> 14:44.255
that I have never had a feeling
as pure or proud

14:45.213 --> 14:48.171
as completing a mission
with our flag on my shoulder.

14:48.880 --> 14:50.171
Stay where you belong.

14:52.171 --> 14:53.005
Thank you.

15:00.296 --> 15:01.713
Good luck.

15:07.296 --> 15:09.005
How many times have you given that speech?

15:09.171 --> 15:10.713
It'll be 173.

15:10.796 --> 15:13.296
Still keeping count
of everything in your life?

15:13.380 --> 15:14.213
Of course.

15:14.296 --> 15:16.046
- It's still a good speech.
- Thank you.

15:16.755 --> 15:17.588
How you been?

15:17.921 --> 15:19.713
I'm okay. You?

15:21.421 --> 15:22.255
Did you get my text?

15:23.588 --> 15:24.421
Yeah.

15:28.296 --> 15:29.755
So? What's your take?

15:31.088 --> 15:32.296
Who else do you have?

15:32.546 --> 15:33.588
I came to you first.

15:39.921 --> 15:41.338
If you can get Redfly,

15:42.130 --> 15:42.963
I'll do it.

15:44.963 --> 15:45.880
Really?

15:47.463 --> 15:48.296
Yeah.

15:49.171 --> 15:50.796
Do you think he's up for it?

15:52.171 --> 15:55.296
I just feel like we owe him.
Besides...

15:55.963 --> 15:58.671
it's always a little harder
than you think it's gonna be, right?

16:01.255 --> 16:02.755
Get the captain, I'm in.

16:05.171 --> 16:10.838
So... this is three bedroom...
and one and a half baths.

16:13.380 --> 16:15.421
Nice view out the back window here.

16:21.005 --> 16:21.963
Gets good light.

16:23.671 --> 16:25.213
Kitchen's right this way.

16:26.088 --> 16:27.838
They're asking $120,000.

16:28.338 --> 16:32.088
- I think there's some flexibility there.
- Yeah.

16:32.546 --> 16:35.088
I don't think this is the one for us.
Thank you, though.

16:37.046 --> 16:38.296
All right, thank you.

16:58.755 --> 17:00.671
Hey, I'm lookin' for a condo.

17:01.255 --> 17:02.838
I hear you're the guy to talk to.

17:04.546 --> 17:06.671
- Sorry to track you down like this.
- Hey, man.

17:06.755 --> 17:07.796
I called your office.

17:07.880 --> 17:10.171
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you.

17:10.255 --> 17:11.755
- You look great.
- Ah, yeah, right.

17:11.838 --> 17:13.796
- No, you do.
- It's been a while, huh?

17:13.880 --> 17:15.880
Well, we didn't hear from you
for a couple of years.

17:15.963 --> 17:18.046
We thought you might have gone full native
in the jungle.

17:18.130 --> 17:19.463
Yeah, I know.

17:20.088 --> 17:20.921
Sorry.

17:22.213 --> 17:24.088
So, how are you?

17:24.630 --> 17:26.755
Uh... I'm okay.

17:27.005 --> 17:28.755
Yeah,
I heard about you and Molly.

17:28.838 --> 17:31.338
Yeah. It happens.

17:32.088 --> 17:34.505
So, I got a job for you.

17:36.296 --> 17:38.963
Guaranteed 17 grand
for a week of consulting.

17:39.546 --> 17:42.046
No action unless you want it.
It's just a recce.

17:42.130 --> 17:42.963
I'm retired.

17:43.963 --> 17:45.130
I know.

17:45.671 --> 17:46.505
What is it?

17:47.255 --> 17:49.046
We're gonna get Gabriel Martin Lorea.

17:49.130 --> 17:50.880
Haven't you been trying
to do that for years?

17:50.963 --> 17:53.755
Yes.
I could never find him, and I finally did.

17:54.755 --> 17:55.838
I can't do it, man.

17:55.921 --> 17:57.796
There's more of this shit
around now than ever.

17:57.880 --> 17:59.921
Anthony was down here trying
to get me to go to Africa for a month,

18:00.005 --> 18:03.255
- but I... I can't... I can't do it.
- I need you on this one.

18:03.796 --> 18:05.796
- It's less than a week of work.
- I would love to.

18:05.880 --> 18:06.838
God knows I could use the money,

18:06.921 --> 18:09.046
but I'm supporting
two households right now.

18:09.505 --> 18:12.005
There's potential
for significant upside on this.

18:12.088 --> 18:14.213
Will you just take a look
at my work on it?

18:16.130 --> 18:18.088
- Are you going to Benny's fight?
- Yeah.

18:18.213 --> 18:20.463
I gotta pick up Tess. I'm late.
Molly's gonna kill me.

18:20.546 --> 18:22.380
- Just ride with me, okay?
- All right.

18:27.255 --> 18:29.880
Molly's still letting you
over here, even after the split?

18:31.171 --> 18:32.338
Only in the garage.

18:34.130 --> 18:35.380
I'm sorry.

18:35.588 --> 18:38.046
Tess!

18:40.921 --> 18:42.671
- Still drink?
- Oh, yeah.

18:42.755 --> 18:43.588
Want a beer?

18:47.838 --> 18:48.796
Ah, shit.

19:03.255 --> 19:05.963
You sleeping with this woman?

19:08.630 --> 19:10.755
The accountant, the bean counter
who gave you all the information.

19:10.838 --> 19:11.755
I'm guessing she's hot.

19:11.838 --> 19:13.421
What's that supposed to mean?

19:13.505 --> 19:15.130
Oh, well, I just noticed, over the years,

19:15.213 --> 19:17.463
your informants tend to be
very attractive women.

19:19.921 --> 19:21.255
No, I'm not.

19:22.671 --> 19:24.171
Why not?

19:25.338 --> 19:27.713
It's a fucked-up enough
situation as it is.

19:29.880 --> 19:30.796
Hey, babe.

19:31.088 --> 19:32.213
Hey, Tess!

19:32.838 --> 19:34.005
Santiago.

19:34.088 --> 19:36.130
Wow, so grown up, man.

19:36.213 --> 19:38.463
Oh, I don't know about that.

19:42.963 --> 19:45.963
I made 17 grand my first year
in the service, man.

19:46.546 --> 19:49.213
If you told me then I'd be passing that up
for a week's work...

19:51.546 --> 19:54.296
Don't worry about her, she's 15.
She's not listening to a word we say.

19:55.213 --> 19:57.213
Seventeen grand is just for the recce.

19:57.421 --> 20:01.296
But if we decide to move forward,
this could be a whole lot more than that.

20:01.921 --> 20:03.671
I've cut a deal
with the agency down there.

20:04.005 --> 20:06.755
We keep 25% of anything we seize.

20:07.088 --> 20:10.463
I've got estimates he's got
over $75 million in cash with him.

20:12.421 --> 20:13.838
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

20:14.213 --> 20:17.671
Let's say the money is there.
How do we get paid?

20:18.088 --> 20:20.255
'Cause this shit is serious,
and it takes real planning.

20:20.338 --> 20:21.380
And you know that.

20:21.463 --> 20:22.880
I've got a lawyer in St. John's

20:23.421 --> 20:25.880
who set up
an offshore shell security operation

20:25.963 --> 20:29.296
that's ready to pay out a salary
and bonuses for the rest of our lives.

20:29.380 --> 20:31.130
It'll just come in
like any other paycheck.

20:31.213 --> 20:33.338
Will you take a look at my work on it?

20:33.421 --> 20:35.546
No, I don't want to see that
because then I can't unsee it.

20:37.380 --> 20:39.713
This operation is... illegal, right?

20:40.546 --> 20:41.671
This is not illegal.

20:41.755 --> 20:45.088
My company's under contract
to an agency of a foreign government.

20:45.171 --> 20:48.796
And besides, even if it was illegal,
most of the live fire you've done's been

20:48.880 --> 20:51.713
against the Geneva Convention,
technically, so...

20:51.796 --> 20:53.880
Come on,
you're a better salesman than that.

20:53.963 --> 20:55.546
This is a very different thing.

20:56.505 --> 20:57.463
I'll be right back.

21:04.421 --> 21:06.588
So you're trying to get him
to go back to work?

21:09.963 --> 21:12.005
Maybe. Why?

21:14.921 --> 21:15.755
No reason.

21:17.505 --> 21:19.505
You think your mom would still let him go?

21:19.796 --> 21:22.171
My mom? Of course.

21:23.005 --> 21:26.005
<i>She's </i> not the problem.

21:26.088 --> 21:28.546
He hasn't worked
since they forced him to retire.

21:31.171 --> 21:32.338
Your dad's a good man.

21:33.838 --> 21:35.463
You shouldn't be too hard on him.

21:48.671 --> 21:52.088
So,
I guess you'll just keep selling condos,

21:52.171 --> 21:55.255
and I'll run and gun
until my knees finally blow out.

21:56.171 --> 21:57.921
Or you could do this without me.

21:58.505 --> 22:00.713
I could. But I don't wanna,

22:01.546 --> 22:03.463
'cause I say we deserve better, man.

22:04.255 --> 22:07.588
How many times did we fly around
with 20 million bucks at our feet

22:07.755 --> 22:10.921
to pay off some cockroach somewhere,
and we never took a dime?

22:12.713 --> 22:14.838
- Hell, you've been shot four times.
- Five.

22:15.838 --> 22:18.046
You've been shot five times
for your country,

22:18.130 --> 22:19.921
and you can't even afford a new truck.

22:20.005 --> 22:21.296
That's the real crime.

22:21.838 --> 22:24.046
- Good to see you, Tess.
- Good to see you.

22:26.546 --> 22:28.505
- You coming back?
- Yeah, I'll be back in 20.

22:28.588 --> 22:30.755
I gotta drop her off. Is Ironhead in?

22:32.088 --> 22:33.088
Only if you are.

22:35.671 --> 22:37.088
- Just take a look.
- Fine.

22:37.171 --> 22:38.963
I'll take a look.
Leave my truck outta this.

22:39.046 --> 22:40.255
This isn't about my truck.

22:40.338 --> 22:42.713
Yes, it is.
That's exactly what this is about!

22:51.755 --> 22:53.713
- Your mom will pick you up, okay?
- Yep.

23:00.880 --> 23:01.755
Hey!

23:03.796 --> 23:04.671
I love you.

23:07.546 --> 23:08.421
I miss you.

23:28.255 --> 23:30.796
- What'd he say?
- He's taking a look at it.

23:32.046 --> 23:33.546
He may not be up for this.

23:34.213 --> 23:36.796
You know he's the best
with something this complex.

23:37.296 --> 23:39.046
And he needs this right now.

23:41.588 --> 23:42.546
All right.

23:45.213 --> 23:47.838
This shit is fuckin' depressing.

23:48.005 --> 23:49.046
C'mon.

23:49.130 --> 23:51.338
Let your brother have some fun.
Support him.

23:51.630 --> 23:54.005
I've been supporting him
since the day he was born.

23:54.296 --> 23:56.630
That kid's a one-in-a-million talent,

23:56.713 --> 24:00.296
going out there, playing the fucking clown
to a bunch of hillbillies.

24:00.921 --> 24:02.296
Ah, yeah,

24:02.380 --> 24:03.713
where are my corner men?

24:05.338 --> 24:06.963
Holy shit, look who it is!

24:08.296 --> 24:11.588
What's up, Benny?
Oh, holy shit!

24:11.671 --> 24:13.505
Oh, God!

24:13.588 --> 24:15.213
Hell of a night for you to show.

24:15.296 --> 24:17.588
- It's great to see you, man.
- You as well.

24:17.671 --> 24:19.338
Hey! Every day you're uglier.

24:19.421 --> 24:21.380
Ah, you little shithead.

24:21.671 --> 24:22.630
Good to see you.

24:23.546 --> 24:25.255
Did you boys get my text?

24:26.380 --> 24:27.755
Yeah?

24:27.838 --> 24:28.755
Fish?

24:29.213 --> 24:31.130
I need a pilot.
I can't do this thing without you.

24:31.921 --> 24:34.380
I don't know, man.
I got the new baby now,

24:35.713 --> 24:38.463
and my lady isn't into me
doing this kinda shit anymore.

24:39.588 --> 24:40.921
What... What does that mean?

24:41.005 --> 24:44.588
Did you read the text? This can change you
and that baby's life forever.

24:45.921 --> 24:48.630
What happened to that bullshit
about going back to your mother's homeland

24:48.713 --> 24:51.046
and empowering the people
to police themselves?

24:52.505 --> 24:55.213
Anyway, I lost my license.
I can't even fly right now.

24:55.880 --> 24:58.005
Well, I don't need a pilot with a license.

24:58.130 --> 25:00.755
I'm in with the army down there.
I just need a pilot I can trust.

25:00.838 --> 25:02.171
Yeah, I don't think so.

25:02.755 --> 25:07.005
Okay.
Lorea is destroying that country.

25:07.255 --> 25:10.463
So we get to take out a very bad man,
and, oh, by the way,

25:10.546 --> 25:13.421
there's a winning lottery ticket stuck
to the bottom of your cowboy boot.

25:14.505 --> 25:17.171
Every guy in that gym would jump at this.

25:17.255 --> 25:18.963
Come on, focus, guys! It's fight night.

25:19.046 --> 25:20.963
Yeah, don't worry about that bullshit.

25:21.046 --> 25:21.963
Sorry, Benny.

25:23.046 --> 25:23.963
You ready for this?

25:24.713 --> 25:26.588
Hell yeah.

25:26.796 --> 25:27.838
Let's go.

25:31.880 --> 25:35.505
- I didn't mean to call your shit bullshit.
- It's all right.

25:36.421 --> 25:37.546
I got busted.

25:38.380 --> 25:39.380
It's not a big deal.

25:40.796 --> 25:42.380
Actually, it's a big deal.

25:44.046 --> 25:44.921
Coke?

25:46.421 --> 25:47.838
Jesus, Frankie.

25:48.838 --> 25:51.713
Technically, it's a suspension.
I'm still under review.

25:55.505 --> 25:57.588
Well, what about you?
What are you gonna do?

25:58.880 --> 26:00.713
I said if Redfly's in, I'm in.

26:00.796 --> 26:03.796
- Come on, stick with me here, guys.
- Oh, I'm with you, Benny.

26:04.130 --> 26:05.171
But are you with me?

26:06.130 --> 26:07.046
Are you in?

26:08.255 --> 26:09.130
You know I am.

26:09.630 --> 26:11.088
I go where you go.

26:11.171 --> 26:13.255
That's what I thought. Benny stands tall.

26:13.338 --> 26:16.130
<i>From Red Feather Lakes, Colorado,</i>

26:16.213 --> 26:20.046
<i>standing six foot three,
weighing in at 195 pounds,</i>

26:20.130 --> 26:24.296
<i>I bring you... Ben Miller!</i>

26:26.880 --> 26:28.880
Go, Ben!

26:30.296 --> 26:32.463
Come on!

26:38.088 --> 26:39.338
Let's go, Benny!

26:40.005 --> 26:41.088
Cheers, man.

26:42.588 --> 26:44.713
Benny, take it easy! Nice and slow!

26:47.421 --> 26:50.046
I took a look at your folder.
It's good work.

26:50.130 --> 26:51.213
Thank you.

26:51.296 --> 26:52.921
You need five guys and a pilot.

26:54.338 --> 26:56.963
Yeah, Benny!

26:57.463 --> 26:59.838
Go! Get him, Benny!

27:02.880 --> 27:04.005
What's up, brother?

27:07.921 --> 27:09.838
The only thing missing is your entry plan.

27:11.755 --> 27:14.630
I have a full set of bullshit passports
waiting for us.

27:15.296 --> 27:17.796
We go through immigration
as power line consultants.

27:17.880 --> 27:18.838
Once we're in-country,

27:18.921 --> 27:21.713
they don't have
any facial recognition cameras yet, so...

27:21.963 --> 27:22.838
we're ghosts.

27:24.880 --> 27:26.171
So what's the verdict?

27:29.963 --> 27:31.838
I'm in for the recce if you guys are.

27:33.255 --> 27:35.588
- You sure?
- Yeah, just the recce though.

27:35.671 --> 27:36.880
No live fire.

27:37.796 --> 27:39.046
- That's all right.
- Okay.

27:41.921 --> 27:42.838
Fish?

27:43.671 --> 27:44.713
When is it?

27:44.796 --> 27:46.046
We leave Thursday.

27:46.130 --> 27:47.588
Okay.

27:48.088 --> 27:50.421
<i>And here we go!</i>

27:50.505 --> 27:52.255
Come on, Benny! Let's go!

27:52.921 --> 27:54.796
All right, it's time to work.

27:54.880 --> 27:55.796
Come on, Benny!

29:24.796 --> 29:25.713
Comms.

29:26.546 --> 29:27.463
Pass those out.

29:34.088 --> 29:35.713
We're in Lorea's backyard.

29:50.296 --> 29:53.213
So what's this guy got against banks?
At least a safe.

29:54.546 --> 29:56.630
<i>The house is the safe.</i>

30:00.380 --> 30:01.713
<i>I'm at the gate.</i>

30:03.213 --> 30:06.255
This looks like everything was done
about 82% right.

30:06.505 --> 30:09.421
<i>They got all the toys out here,
but these cameras aren't even aimed</i>

30:09.505 --> 30:10.796
<i>at the weakest breach point.</i>

30:11.463 --> 30:13.546
<i>Your girlfriend's making</i>
<i>her normal money drop?</i>

30:13.630 --> 30:14.463
<i>Yeah.</i>

30:15.713 --> 30:18.088
<i>She's prepared to record
the inside of the house.</i>

30:18.171 --> 30:19.005
<i>Pope...</i>

30:19.088 --> 30:22.130
<i>Pope, I have kids over here.
Does he have kids living in here with him?</i>

30:23.130 --> 30:25.463
'Cause that's gonna make things
a whole lot more complicated

30:25.546 --> 30:27.588
and is not what I signed up for.

30:27.921 --> 30:30.380
The family's not the problem.
They're the answer.

30:31.505 --> 30:32.463
Why?

30:33.088 --> 30:34.380
<i>Church.</i>

30:34.546 --> 30:36.005
Lorea's very devout.

30:36.338 --> 30:37.630
<i>Every Sunday morning,</i>

30:37.713 --> 30:40.546
he sends three guards
to the 6:00 a.m. service.

30:40.671 --> 30:42.213
When they get back,
he sends the rest of the team,

30:42.296 --> 30:44.963
<i>along with his family, into town to mass.</i>

30:45.130 --> 30:46.171
<i>That leaves him</i>

30:46.546 --> 30:49.546
<i>and three guards in that house,
and that's our window.</i>

30:50.380 --> 30:51.546
Why would he do that?

30:51.630 --> 30:53.755
<i>Worried</i>
<i>about someone taking his kids.</i>

30:54.338 --> 30:55.921
<i>And he never leaves his money.</i>

30:56.380 --> 30:58.713
Also, I don't think he believes
anyone actually has the balls

30:58.796 --> 31:00.088
to come out here and rob him.

31:00.463 --> 31:02.588
It's probably 'cause it's a stupid idea.

31:06.088 --> 31:08.588
<i>Pope,</i>
<i>I got your girlfriend coming up right now.</i>

31:09.755 --> 31:11.046
Holy shit.

31:11.130 --> 31:12.755
She is beautiful, man.

31:13.630 --> 31:15.171
I fucking knew it.

31:15.880 --> 31:16.755
Fuck off.

31:27.421 --> 31:28.713
God damn.

31:33.463 --> 31:36.046
I got an execution
about to go down over here.

31:36.296 --> 31:37.588
Are you at the tennis courts?

31:37.671 --> 31:38.505
<i>Yeah.</i>

31:38.588 --> 31:39.796
Yeah, that's his spot.

31:41.505 --> 31:42.755
<i>Perdóname, padre.</i>

31:55.755 --> 31:57.130
<i>Why is she doing this?</i>

31:58.921 --> 32:01.713
<i>She hopes I can get</i>
<i>her little brother out of jail.</i>

32:02.755 --> 32:04.213
<i>Did you put him in jail?</i>

32:05.046 --> 32:06.963
- <i>Not really.</i>
<i>- Buenas.</i>

32:08.088 --> 32:10.380
<i> I'm guessing that's putting her</i>
<i>at some risk.</i>

32:10.463 --> 32:13.380
<i>Man, I almost forgot</i>
<i>why I got out of this business.</i>

32:13.713 --> 32:15.380
<i>Shit gets so dark so quick.</i>

32:18.838 --> 32:20.963
Oh, shit,
we got ground sensors here, boys.

32:21.963 --> 32:23.088
<i>Did you hit one?</i>

32:24.880 --> 32:26.505
I don't know, I'm not sure.

32:38.671 --> 32:41.255
Benny, I got two guys
on motorbikes coming your way.

32:42.005 --> 32:44.671
<i>Hold tight, Benny.</i>
<i>I'm trying to get out there to cover you.</i>

32:47.421 --> 32:49.255
Good afternoon, Mr. Lorea.

33:03.921 --> 33:05.838
A stock boy job
at Walmart's starting

33:05.921 --> 33:07.671
to look pretty good right now, boys.

33:09.838 --> 33:11.130
It looks good to me.

33:11.213 --> 33:12.213
Good.

33:15.546 --> 33:17.130
Okay.

33:19.713 --> 33:21.130
Thank you, sir.

33:25.921 --> 33:27.921
I'm clear. They're coming back to you.

33:31.421 --> 33:34.338
Let's get the fuck outta here.

33:39.255 --> 33:41.130
You were gonna piss yourself.

33:41.213 --> 33:43.338
I was getting onto the déjà vu part, man.

33:46.755 --> 33:48.088
So what's the plan?

33:48.630 --> 33:50.796
Are their guys prepared to operate
across the border?

33:51.338 --> 33:52.671
What's the scope of this thing?

33:52.755 --> 33:54.713
Sunday soft hit is the way to do it.

33:55.088 --> 33:57.380
Otherwise, you bring in an army,
you'd start a fucking war up there.

33:57.463 --> 34:01.130
Mm-hmm. So, when do you need
to present to the agency down here?

34:04.171 --> 34:06.505
I'm not sure I wanna tell them.

34:07.046 --> 34:07.880
Why?

34:08.838 --> 34:09.963
We saw the place.

34:10.505 --> 34:11.545
It's full of holes.

34:12.213 --> 34:14.213
So maybe we don't tell them...

34:14.880 --> 34:17.545
...and we do this thing ourselves.

34:19.670 --> 34:20.505
What?

34:21.088 --> 34:22.463
What?

34:22.545 --> 34:24.545
Now, we each took 17 grand...

34:25.130 --> 34:28.920
to help the narcotics unit map out
and plan this fuckin' thing.

34:29.005 --> 34:31.338
I told you I wasn't even comfortable
helping them do it.

34:31.505 --> 34:34.463
Now you want us to do it by ourselves?
Kill a bunch of fuckin' narcos?

34:34.545 --> 34:37.588
If we hit that window, like you said,
when they're at church,

34:37.963 --> 34:40.338
nobody but Lorea gets killed.

34:42.005 --> 34:43.380
And I'm okay with that.

34:43.963 --> 34:46.088
Does the agency down here
even know about this?

34:46.380 --> 34:48.005
- What do you mean?
- Come on, man!

34:48.088 --> 34:49.170
Don't fuck around.

34:49.713 --> 34:51.045
Who paid our fees?

34:52.130 --> 34:53.755
It's complicated, technically...

34:54.630 --> 34:56.338
you guys were paid through an LLC.

34:56.963 --> 34:59.046
Mm, no, not that complicated.

34:59.130 --> 35:01.171
It's $100,000.
Where the fuck did it come from?

35:08.421 --> 35:09.546
I'll get the bill.

35:10.046 --> 35:11.171
Thanks.

35:12.588 --> 35:13.880
Great trip, boys.

35:13.963 --> 35:16.671
It's turning out
to be some full-on cowboy shit.

35:25.838 --> 35:27.005
Whose money is it, huh?

35:28.505 --> 35:29.838
- It was my money.
- Jeez.

35:29.921 --> 35:31.380
What were you thinking?

35:31.463 --> 35:33.338
What?
Does that change anything?

35:33.755 --> 35:34.838
Yeah, man.

35:35.546 --> 35:37.255
You fucking lied to us.

35:37.338 --> 35:39.213
No, I didn't lie to you.

35:39.296 --> 35:41.005
I asked you guys to come down here,

35:41.088 --> 35:43.171
do reconnaissance, and make a plan.

35:43.630 --> 35:46.671
Now, we can execute that plan alone

35:46.755 --> 35:48.338
and take all of the money,

35:49.546 --> 35:52.588
or you guys can fuck off,
and I'll bring the team from down here in.

35:53.921 --> 35:57.213
But I assure you, if I do that,
this fucker will find out about it,

35:57.296 --> 35:59.713
and he'll be gone, and I need this guy.

35:59.796 --> 36:02.505
You know how many fucking bad men
are out there all over the world?

36:03.713 --> 36:05.546
Yeah, well, this is my last one.

36:05.630 --> 36:08.171
And you may not believe it,

36:08.255 --> 36:10.671
but I have been here
for the last three years of my life,

36:10.755 --> 36:12.963
trying to make a difference,
but it's a fucking mess.

36:13.046 --> 36:14.546
And it's all because of Lorea.

36:15.463 --> 36:19.380
The thought of leaving everything
we've done behind for the last 17 years,

36:19.755 --> 36:20.921
with nothing to show for it...

36:21.005 --> 36:22.838
Fuck you, nothing to show for it.

36:23.755 --> 36:24.630
Look, if...

36:24.713 --> 36:26.921
If we had accomplished half the things
that we've accomplished

36:27.005 --> 36:29.213
in any other profession,
we'd be set for life.

36:29.296 --> 36:31.713
Hey, man, that's the deal we cut.

36:31.921 --> 36:33.963
- Well, it's a shitty deal.
- Yeah, well...

36:34.505 --> 36:36.088
Because this man's a goddamn hero,

36:36.171 --> 36:38.255
and he can't even send his kids
to college.

36:38.630 --> 36:42.880
And Fish's the most talented pilot I know,
and he's grounded on a bullshit coke rap.

36:42.963 --> 36:45.713
And how many times can your brother
get the shit knocked out of him for...

36:45.796 --> 36:47.880
I didn't get the shit beat out of me.
I won that fight.

36:47.963 --> 36:48.796
Sorry, Benny.

36:49.338 --> 36:51.796
And how many more pep talks
can you possibly give?

36:53.088 --> 36:54.130
I'm done, man.

36:54.630 --> 36:55.838
Both knees are shot.

36:56.171 --> 36:58.588
That neck operation I got last year
made the whole thing worse.

36:59.963 --> 37:01.255
So, the question is,

37:01.338 --> 37:04.130
do we finally get to use our skills
for our own benefit

37:04.546 --> 37:06.171
and actually change something?

37:19.463 --> 37:20.630
So, are we doing this?

37:21.338 --> 37:22.713
How the fuck am I supposed to know?

37:23.380 --> 37:25.630
This guy doesn't come through
with the one key piece of intel

37:25.713 --> 37:27.005
we need to make this decision.

37:27.088 --> 37:27.921
For all we know,

37:28.005 --> 37:29.838
she could be setting us up
to get her brother back.

37:29.921 --> 37:31.171
We'll know tomorrow.

37:31.838 --> 37:34.296
She should have been recording
that whole thing today.

37:35.838 --> 37:37.880
All right, if it does come back clean,

37:39.671 --> 37:41.921
how would you do
the Sunday morning version?

37:42.671 --> 37:45.546
- I haven't thought about it.
- Bullshit, you can't help yourself.

37:47.921 --> 37:48.963
All right.

37:49.046 --> 37:51.630
In the first pop, you'd have 40 minutes
to get in, get the job done,

37:51.713 --> 37:53.755
and get out before the family
comes home from church.

37:53.838 --> 37:54.713
That's a hard out.

37:55.046 --> 37:56.463
We need to breach the fence,

37:56.546 --> 37:59.088
sweep the premises,
find and subdue the guards,

37:59.171 --> 38:01.713
scrub the hard drives
in the security room,

38:01.796 --> 38:06.213
get rid of Lorea, find the money,
pack the money into 18 hundred-pound bags,

38:06.296 --> 38:08.755
and then hoof it half a mile
to the nearest vehicle.

38:08.838 --> 38:10.255
There's only two ways out:

38:10.338 --> 38:12.671
the fence in the front,
or over the mountain we came down,

38:12.755 --> 38:13.880
and I'm too old for that.

38:14.796 --> 38:16.546
We need to use one of their vans.

38:16.963 --> 38:18.380
There were two vans in the courtyard.

38:19.130 --> 38:22.421
But if the family uses those vans
to go to church, then we got nothing.

38:22.505 --> 38:23.796
So we need another van.

38:24.963 --> 38:27.380
- Can your girl work that out?
- I can ask her.

38:29.838 --> 38:31.880
Still got your aviation guy down here?

38:32.588 --> 38:35.421
'Cause we would need
a heavy-lift helicopter in 32 hours

38:35.505 --> 38:37.671
to get us over the Andes and to the ocean.

38:37.963 --> 38:39.921
I don't know, but I'll give him a call.

38:41.088 --> 38:44.005
Oh, yeah! Big dog is back!

38:44.671 --> 38:46.546
Redfly's gonna be rich, boys!

38:48.963 --> 38:50.005
Now we're talkin'.

39:07.338 --> 39:08.421
Hello.

39:08.838 --> 39:09.713
<i>Hola.</i>

39:11.463 --> 39:12.296
<i>¿Señor?</i>

39:12.588 --> 39:15.463
Thank you. Have a good day.

39:27.213 --> 39:30.755
- Thank you.
- That's it?

39:32.755 --> 39:33.796
I don't know.

39:33.880 --> 39:35.671
Miss, two coffees, please.

39:35.755 --> 39:37.421
- My brother.
- Yeah.

39:38.213 --> 39:40.463
I might need you to do one more thing
for me.

39:41.755 --> 39:43.463
Can you get an extra van...

39:44.046 --> 39:45.921
into the compound, Sunday morning?

39:47.046 --> 39:49.005
If I did that,
they're going to know it's me.

39:49.546 --> 39:52.755
And everyone who works for him
ends up dead, sooner or later.

39:54.130 --> 39:57.005
If you can get me an extra van
in there Sunday morning...

39:58.713 --> 40:01.088
I will get you and your brother
out of the country

40:01.171 --> 40:02.880
with new papers and money.

40:05.380 --> 40:06.255
How much?

40:09.171 --> 40:10.171
Two million.

40:10.421 --> 40:11.255
Two million?

40:12.671 --> 40:13.505
Yes.

40:13.588 --> 40:15.671
And you'll only have a couple hours
to get my brother?

40:16.463 --> 40:17.505
I'll find a way.

40:19.713 --> 40:22.338
But I need that van inside those gates.

40:27.755 --> 40:30.005
Okay.

40:31.088 --> 40:33.796
- Yeah?
- Yes. I'll get the van.

40:33.880 --> 40:37.380
But if we're not gone forever
after you make your move, we are dead.

40:38.671 --> 40:39.546
You'll be gone.

40:42.671 --> 40:43.505
Yeah.

40:46.796 --> 40:47.713
Thank you.

41:07.796 --> 41:08.838
Hey, fellas.

41:11.796 --> 41:12.921
Take a look at this.

41:15.130 --> 41:16.713
Jesus, Pope!

41:18.005 --> 41:20.755
- What the hell were you planning here?
- Exactly this.

41:21.463 --> 41:22.963
Every single gun, bullet,

41:23.046 --> 41:25.255
and fucking toothpick here's been sourced
in-country.

41:26.588 --> 41:28.921
The idea is to pin this
on a local rival gang.

41:30.171 --> 41:33.088
Now, who was it
that didn't trust this lady?

41:34.338 --> 41:37.880
'Cause not only is she going to get us
that extra van, but she got us this.

41:41.505 --> 41:42.921
There's our man, Lorea.

41:43.880 --> 41:44.755
And, oh!

41:45.671 --> 41:46.963
Look at what's there behind him.

41:47.046 --> 41:49.213
Looks like money to me.

41:49.296 --> 41:52.088
- There's gotta be about 35 million there.
- We don't know that.

41:52.171 --> 41:53.380
Whatever it is, it's a lot.

41:53.921 --> 41:55.713
What are you gonna do
with your share, huh?

41:55.796 --> 41:58.380
Never spend your money
until it's in your pocket, Benjamin.

41:58.463 --> 42:00.921
Well, I'm just sayin',
I'm gonna get that Ferrari, man.

42:01.005 --> 42:03.255
- How original.
- What about the bird?

42:04.671 --> 42:08.005
Well, he said if we're there
with three million bucks, he'll be there.

42:08.630 --> 42:10.713
So we got a bird, we got a van,

42:11.338 --> 42:13.963
we got Lorea confirmed
in the house with the money.

42:18.505 --> 42:20.463
All right, give me... give me a minute.

42:35.088 --> 42:37.630
Uh, you know, if you had pulled this shit
when we were active duty,

42:37.713 --> 42:39.213
I would have court-martialed your ass.

42:40.588 --> 42:42.671
Look, why don't we all
just have a dinner tonight,

42:42.755 --> 42:45.296
get drunk, on me,
and you all can go home in the morning?

42:46.671 --> 42:47.963
Nah, fuck that.

42:48.796 --> 42:50.421
I can't.

42:51.005 --> 42:52.046
Somehow, I just...

42:54.796 --> 42:56.755
...ended up against it here. You know?

42:57.505 --> 43:00.130
I'm burning through my pension.
Molly's job doesn't cut it.

43:01.380 --> 43:03.296
I can't sell condos
to save my fucking life.

43:03.380 --> 43:06.046
The only thing I have
is taking care of these girls.

43:06.505 --> 43:07.380
Yeah.

43:08.005 --> 43:09.380
Yeah, I understand that.

43:11.588 --> 43:13.296
Fuck, I missed this.

43:15.338 --> 43:18.421
It's like they take your best 20 years,
and then spit you out.

43:19.296 --> 43:20.130
Yeah.

43:20.296 --> 43:22.421
I just can't stop thinking
about the mistakes.

43:24.088 --> 43:26.880
- What mistakes?
- Fuck, man.

43:28.171 --> 43:29.088
All of 'em.

43:30.796 --> 43:33.130
- Didn't get better when you got out?
- No.

43:34.213 --> 43:37.130
Only thing that made it feel better
is when you put a gun in my hand.

43:38.713 --> 43:40.630
So, I guess that's what we'll do.

43:51.838 --> 43:54.255
<i>All right, first things first:</i>

43:54.338 --> 43:55.171
<i>safety.</i>

43:56.005 --> 43:58.213
There is no medevac.
There is no ground support.

43:58.296 --> 44:00.755
Any injuries we sustain,
we're walking out with.

44:01.046 --> 44:03.630
Be mindful,
each of you has a medical kit in your bag.

44:04.546 --> 44:05.380
Number two:

44:05.463 --> 44:07.921
you cannot go back
to your normal life after tonight.

44:08.338 --> 44:12.046
Make no mistake about it.
What we are about to do is criminal.

44:13.171 --> 44:16.005
We do not have the flag on our shoulders,
and no amount of bullshit

44:16.088 --> 44:17.755
that we tell ourselves
is gonna change that.

44:18.505 --> 44:19.796
If we do our job right,

44:19.880 --> 44:22.713
we will be committing one murder
and one armed robbery.

44:23.130 --> 44:25.171
You guys need to own the fact
that you are desecrating

44:25.255 --> 44:26.963
most of the oaths you ever took.

44:28.338 --> 44:29.963
Third:

44:30.380 --> 44:31.255
family.

44:32.213 --> 44:34.005
If they don't go to church,
or if they come home early,

44:34.088 --> 44:36.755
it's an abort. Full stop.
They are not who we came for.

44:37.630 --> 44:38.588
And lastly,

44:38.963 --> 44:40.546
it's not too late to go home.

44:40.838 --> 44:42.421
We had an agreement with Pope,

44:42.713 --> 44:44.088
and we fulfilled that.

44:44.505 --> 44:47.630
Any man here who wants to walk away now
can do so knowing they're the best of us.

44:47.921 --> 44:49.088
But it's gotta be now.

44:54.963 --> 44:56.796
I wanna make sure
we're not leaving that house

44:56.880 --> 44:58.380
without taking care of Lorea.

44:58.463 --> 45:00.546
If he's there like he's supposed to be,
we'll get him.

45:01.880 --> 45:02.880
We leave at 0300.

45:05.796 --> 45:06.838
Hooah.

45:14.921 --> 45:17.380
<i>It's a good thing</i>
<i>these guys are so devout.</i>

45:17.463 --> 45:18.505
Our dad used to say,

45:18.588 --> 45:21.088
"When it's raining, it means
God didn't need us in church today."

45:21.671 --> 45:25.380
He also said you go to heaven
for the climate and hell for the company.

45:25.880 --> 45:27.880
<i>Actually, I think Mark Twain said that.</i>

45:27.963 --> 45:30.338
All right, keep the radio clear,
let's stay awake here.

45:32.296 --> 45:34.088
<i>How many is that getting in? Count it.</i>

45:35.088 --> 45:36.380
Seven getting in the van.

45:37.255 --> 45:38.630
<i>Anybody see Lorea?</i>

45:39.255 --> 45:41.213
Negative. We never saw him come out.

45:41.796 --> 45:44.796
The wife and two kids are in
with a single driver.

45:45.546 --> 45:47.296
<i>The family's left the building.</i>

45:48.005 --> 45:50.588
<i>Repeat, family are all clear.</i>

45:53.088 --> 45:54.463
All right, let's get ready here.

45:58.838 --> 46:00.921
Damn, Pope, this lady is a keeper.

46:01.005 --> 46:03.255
Punctual, smart, and brave as shit.

46:11.213 --> 46:12.713
- Good day.
- What's this?

46:13.588 --> 46:16.338
I'm here to drop off this van,
and then my brother is taking me home.

46:16.421 --> 46:18.796
That idiot didn't tell me.

46:28.588 --> 46:30.213
She's in. She's in.

46:30.546 --> 46:31.463
<i>Here we go.</i>

46:31.546 --> 46:33.505
<i>Ben, you're first hit.
Call when it's secure.</i>

46:33.755 --> 46:36.171
<i>With this rain,
the guards are gonna be inside.</i>

46:36.796 --> 46:37.671
<i>Roger.</i>

47:18.130 --> 47:20.796
- <i>All clear, she's gone.</i>
<i>- </i><i>Copy.</i>

47:21.213 --> 47:22.921
<i>All right, we're going in.</i>

48:42.505 --> 48:43.838
<i>Front gate secure.</i>

48:44.796 --> 48:46.505
One guard secured in the kitchen.

48:46.963 --> 48:49.546
- <i>Ben, come to the house.</i>
<i>- </i><i>Roger.</i>

49:01.713 --> 49:03.296
<i>I'm at the front door.</i>

49:03.880 --> 49:05.505
Hold, Benny. Hold.

49:05.588 --> 49:07.130
<i>Threat in the TV room.</i>

49:07.588 --> 49:09.213
We're gonna go around the side.

49:16.296 --> 49:17.755
<i>What's going on in there?</i>

49:17.838 --> 49:20.005
All clear, Benny.
Eyes out for Lorea.

49:20.088 --> 49:21.588
He sure as fuck heard us now.

49:21.671 --> 49:22.546
<i>I'm coming in.</i>

49:22.630 --> 49:24.755
Setting charges to the security room.

49:32.046 --> 49:33.213
<i>What was that?</i>

49:33.296 --> 49:34.671
We had to shoot the second guard
in the leg.

49:34.755 --> 49:37.630
- They're taking him to the kitchen.
<i>- Coming down.</i>

49:37.713 --> 49:38.588
Come on.

50:02.546 --> 50:03.755
<i>Fuse is burning.</i>

50:33.588 --> 50:35.046
<i>Any trace of him?</i>

50:36.963 --> 50:38.380
<i>She said he never leaves.</i>

50:40.630 --> 50:43.963
We got nothing. This guy's a ghost.

50:48.421 --> 50:50.630
<i>Everyone to the office, right now.</i>

51:14.588 --> 51:15.921
What the fuck?

51:19.255 --> 51:20.088
And Lorea?

51:20.338 --> 51:22.505
Nothing. A couple of bags.

51:23.338 --> 51:25.546
He's gone.

51:26.546 --> 51:27.588
With the money.

51:27.671 --> 51:29.880
Your girl gave us up, Pope.

51:30.463 --> 51:32.213
We gotta get the fuck outta here.

51:34.130 --> 51:35.713
No, no, no, no, no, no.

51:48.921 --> 51:50.588
What's that smell like to you?

51:51.046 --> 51:53.921
Like a serious fuck-up.

51:55.630 --> 51:56.505
No.

51:58.130 --> 51:59.171
Paint.

52:06.338 --> 52:07.463
The house is the safe.

52:11.088 --> 52:12.588
The house is the fucking safe.

52:40.463 --> 52:42.005
Benny, help me move this.
Come on.

52:42.088 --> 52:43.755
- I'll take the edge.
- Over there.

52:43.838 --> 52:45.963
Go, come on. Come on, man. Come on!

52:46.296 --> 52:48.088
- Holy shit!
- Come on.

52:48.171 --> 52:50.755
Go. Move, move.

52:51.421 --> 52:52.421
C'mon.

52:52.546 --> 52:54.380
- Oh, my God!
- Fish, I'm up.

52:55.921 --> 52:57.130
Come on, guys!

52:57.880 --> 53:00.963
Holy shit!

53:01.380 --> 53:02.880
What'd I tell you, boys?

53:02.963 --> 53:05.380
Jesus Christ!

53:07.713 --> 53:09.338
Fucking God! Look at it!

53:09.421 --> 53:11.630
- It goes all the way up!
- Let's go!

53:14.338 --> 53:15.796
We're gonna need some bags.

53:21.005 --> 53:24.463
- I'll get another bag!
- Keep it coming.

53:27.338 --> 53:28.171
What's wrong?

53:29.255 --> 53:31.255
If the money's still here,
it means he's still here.

53:31.338 --> 53:32.380
He's gone, man.

53:33.005 --> 53:34.171
We got more!

53:34.255 --> 53:35.463
Back wall, too.

53:35.546 --> 53:36.921
Just concentrate.

53:37.005 --> 53:38.630
Oh, we're just gettin' rich!

53:38.880 --> 53:40.505
How much time we got?

53:40.588 --> 53:42.713
Eight minutes.

53:43.421 --> 53:45.088
Millers, enough of that over there.

53:45.171 --> 53:46.838
We gotta start getting this shit
to the van.

53:46.921 --> 53:48.005
Yeah, we got this.

53:50.463 --> 53:52.380
- Come on, bro.
- Keep your eyes open.

53:52.505 --> 53:56.755
Yeah, bitches!

54:00.380 --> 54:02.796
Here, take these.
I'm gonna go get the van.

54:02.880 --> 54:04.005
- Meet me there.
- Yes, sir.

54:04.088 --> 54:05.046
Careful.

54:16.130 --> 54:18.296
Classic.

54:31.296 --> 54:32.546
Jesus Christ.

54:32.963 --> 54:35.421
- Help us, man!
- Come on! Come on!

54:36.463 --> 54:38.046
Come on. Over there.

54:41.213 --> 54:43.755
Holy shit!

54:57.880 --> 55:00.755
We're gonna need more bags.
See if you can find something.

55:00.838 --> 55:01.755
On it.

55:03.505 --> 55:04.713
I tell you one thing, man,

55:04.796 --> 55:06.505
you can tell your girls
they can stop studying

55:06.588 --> 55:08.838
'cause Daddy's just gonna buy their way
into Harvard!

55:10.296 --> 55:13.088
Holy shit,
this is a fuckload of money!

55:14.296 --> 55:15.463
Grab some of those and go.

55:16.046 --> 55:16.963
How are we on time?

55:17.046 --> 55:18.546
We got time for a couple more loads.

55:18.630 --> 55:20.130
- You sure?
- Grab those and bring 'em down.

55:21.630 --> 55:22.463
Guys!

55:23.088 --> 55:25.005
I got another wall over here!

55:25.088 --> 55:26.838
- Holy shit!
- Shit!

55:27.671 --> 55:28.546
It's everywhere.

55:28.713 --> 55:30.338
Well, fuck me!

55:33.130 --> 55:34.755
It's the whole fucking house.

55:37.713 --> 55:38.880
What's up?

55:38.963 --> 55:40.421
The van's full, man!

55:41.296 --> 55:42.796
It's all good. We gotta go.

55:46.463 --> 55:47.671
What the hell are you doing?

55:48.046 --> 55:50.088
Stop digging more out.
We got all this to deal with.

55:50.171 --> 55:51.255
A couple more loads.

55:55.463 --> 55:58.755
You know, in the ten years
I've been working with you, Tom,

55:58.838 --> 56:00.921
you have never missed a hard out!

56:02.838 --> 56:04.380
I gave us a 15-minute cushion.

56:05.630 --> 56:08.463
It's 12 minutes to the church,
a 40-minute service, 12 minutes back.

56:09.005 --> 56:10.921
Add 5 minutes
to load in and out of the van,

56:11.005 --> 56:12.796
and we can subtract 7 to beat them
to the exit route.

56:12.880 --> 56:13.755
We will be fine!

56:14.463 --> 56:17.296
All right?
God damn it, look at all this money!

56:17.921 --> 56:19.421
Just a couple more loads!

56:21.796 --> 56:22.671
Fuck this!

56:26.588 --> 56:28.130
Time's up. We gotta go.

56:28.921 --> 56:31.130
I want one more sweep for Lorea.

56:32.713 --> 56:33.755
All right?

56:36.421 --> 56:37.880
And then we burn it all down.

56:44.880 --> 56:45.755
Okay,

56:46.463 --> 56:48.171
I'll get these last one loaded down there,

56:48.505 --> 56:50.630
and you call out when you're ready
to light it up.

56:55.213 --> 56:57.380
Move. Move!

57:32.296 --> 57:34.046
Come on, we gotta go!

57:35.463 --> 57:36.838
Lighting it up.

57:49.755 --> 57:51.171
What are we shooting at in here?

57:56.130 --> 57:57.171
Is that Lorea?

57:59.171 --> 58:00.130
He's dead.

58:01.463 --> 58:02.296
Good.

58:02.630 --> 58:04.921
I'm hit.

58:05.171 --> 58:06.380
Shit!

58:09.171 --> 58:10.671
- Take it easy.
- Where?

58:10.755 --> 58:12.296
Left side.

58:13.838 --> 58:14.755
Did it go through?

58:14.838 --> 58:16.130
Yeah, it went through.

58:16.213 --> 58:17.463
- I'll be fine.
- It'll be okay.

58:17.546 --> 58:19.630
- Get the clot kit.
- Straight through.

58:19.713 --> 58:20.838
You'll be okay.

58:20.921 --> 58:22.171
You'll be all right.

58:22.255 --> 58:23.088
Just breathe.

58:24.671 --> 58:25.505
I'm okay.

58:26.880 --> 58:28.838
All right. Let go.

58:30.255 --> 58:33.046
- Told you this was a stupid idea.
- Yeah, you sure did.

58:36.963 --> 58:38.338
Sunday school's over, boys.

58:38.921 --> 58:39.796
They're back.

58:41.005 --> 58:41.921
Oh, shit!

58:44.671 --> 58:46.838
- The family?
- No, the first shift of guards.

58:47.421 --> 58:48.380
- You okay?
- I'm all right.

58:48.463 --> 58:49.588
You gonna be able to move?

58:49.671 --> 58:50.963
- We don't got a stretcher.
- Yeah.

58:51.255 --> 58:53.046
Just help me get my kit back on.

58:56.588 --> 58:58.463
All right, we can each take
a backpack of cash,

58:59.255 --> 59:02.005
we go out through the back
into the jungle, and we're gone.

59:02.088 --> 59:04.838
- I'll cover the cost of the operation.
- Fuck that.

59:05.338 --> 59:08.338
No.We are bringing Ironhead home safe.

59:08.671 --> 59:10.088
Not dragging him through the jungle.

59:10.171 --> 59:12.421
And we're not leaving them
any of this fucking money.

59:12.671 --> 59:15.213
Right, so we burn it all down and go.

59:15.296 --> 59:18.130
There's about $100 million
for them waiting in the van out there.

59:18.213 --> 59:19.796
We need to hunt and shoot quickly.

59:20.255 --> 59:22.505
Call out your kills.
I don't want any fuckin' surprises.

59:22.588 --> 59:24.796
- Got it?
- All right.

59:24.880 --> 59:26.213
Let's do this.

59:27.255 --> 59:29.380
You two go that way,
we'll come down the front.

59:30.213 --> 59:31.046
I'm all right.

59:31.630 --> 59:32.588
Let's just do it.

59:33.505 --> 59:34.463
All right.

59:35.796 --> 59:36.630
All right.

59:42.046 --> 59:43.171
Let's go.

59:47.963 --> 59:49.588
<i>Here we go, fellas.</i>

01:00:01.088 --> 01:00:03.171
<i>That's two down in the front hall.</i>

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:07.130
<i>That's three.</i>

01:00:13.171 --> 01:00:14.255
<i>That's four.</i>

01:00:14.338 --> 01:00:15.671
<i>Get back to the gate.</i>

01:00:15.755 --> 01:00:17.838
<i>I'm sure they dropped
a few guys out there.</i>

01:00:17.921 --> 01:00:18.796
On the way.

01:00:52.546 --> 01:00:54.671
<i>Anybody got eyes</i>
<i>on that SUV the guards came in?</i>

01:00:54.755 --> 01:00:56.296
<i>Because we're gonna need it.</i>

01:00:57.130 --> 01:00:58.755
<i>I'm already loading it up.</i>

01:01:00.171 --> 01:01:01.796
<i>Is everybody out of there?</i>

01:01:02.130 --> 01:01:04.671
- <i>Coast's clear.</i>
<i>- </i><i>All clear.</i>

01:01:13.421 --> 01:01:15.505
<i>Another van of guys</i>
<i>just passed me in the driveway.</i>

01:01:32.130 --> 01:01:34.005
Catfish is coming around
with the van.

01:01:37.171 --> 01:01:39.171
What are you doing?
Come on! Let's go!

01:02:04.421 --> 01:02:06.463
Benny! Hey!

01:02:07.796 --> 01:02:09.380
Let's go, man! Hustle!

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:13.713
Fuck!

01:02:14.588 --> 01:02:15.546
Fuck!

01:02:22.921 --> 01:02:24.005
Fuck!

01:02:24.130 --> 01:02:26.213
- What?
- What do you mean, what?

01:02:26.296 --> 01:02:29.338
That was a shit job back there, man.
We don't leave messes like that!

01:02:32.421 --> 01:02:35.296
<i>What do we do up here?</i>
<i>I've got the family waiting to go in.</i>

01:02:37.088 --> 01:02:38.046
<i>Take it slow.</i>

01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:24.338
Your girlfriend's here.

01:03:28.546 --> 01:03:30.338
- Did you get out okay?
- Yes.

01:03:30.421 --> 01:03:32.588
We're almost there. Help me.

01:03:33.046 --> 01:03:33.880
<i>Vamos.</i>

01:03:34.963 --> 01:03:36.880
Just load 'em up, and I'll weigh 'em.

01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:44.588
- Where's your guy?
- He'll be here.

01:03:58.130 --> 01:04:00.130
What the fuck we gonna do with that thing?

01:04:10.088 --> 01:04:10.963
William.

01:04:11.255 --> 01:04:14.713
<i>- Habibi.</i>
<i>- Kaifa halak?</i>

01:04:15.421 --> 01:04:17.046
- You made it.
- Count on me.

01:04:17.213 --> 01:04:18.046
Mosquito bite?

01:04:18.505 --> 01:04:20.088
Yeah, a little one.

01:04:20.338 --> 01:04:22.130
Feels worse than it looks.

01:04:24.171 --> 01:04:26.171
Now how the hell are we all gonna fit
in that?

01:04:27.088 --> 01:04:29.505
- Come when you're ready.
<i>- Copy.</i>

01:04:29.588 --> 01:04:32.005
Feel free to count it.

01:04:32.338 --> 01:04:33.505
I know where to find you.

01:04:35.671 --> 01:04:36.505
Voilà!

01:05:00.171 --> 01:05:02.296
It won't all fit in the net!

01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:04.380
We gotta get the rest on it inside!

01:05:13.755 --> 01:05:15.421
I don't know if that scale's fucked up,

01:05:15.505 --> 01:05:18.088
but he's telling me
we got 6,000 pounds here.

01:05:18.171 --> 01:05:20.755
That's $250 million.

01:05:20.838 --> 01:05:22.671
We stole 250 million?

01:05:23.213 --> 01:05:25.213
I'm definitely getting that Ferrari!

01:05:25.296 --> 01:05:26.255
- Are you sure?
- Let's go!

01:05:26.338 --> 01:05:29.005
If that scale is even close
to being right,

01:05:29.088 --> 01:05:30.463
we're gonna have a weight issue.

01:05:30.546 --> 01:05:33.630
What's the issue?
This helo can carry 9,000 pounds.

01:05:34.505 --> 01:05:37.505
That's 9,000 at 2,000 feet.

01:05:37.588 --> 01:05:41.380
If we want to get to the ocean,
we gotta fly over the fucking Andes, man.

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:45.838
Are we really leaving $200 million
on the fucking runway?

01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:51.046
Okay, she'll make it. Let's go!

01:05:52.546 --> 01:05:55.380
What's your plan for her?
We're already overweight as it is.

01:05:56.046 --> 01:05:58.755
We promised them a ride
over the border into Peru.

01:05:59.546 --> 01:06:01.130
And we're gonna stand by that!

01:07:05.213 --> 01:07:08.630
Okay, we're gonna let you go now.

01:07:08.713 --> 01:07:09.630
Thank you.

01:07:09.713 --> 01:07:11.380
I just need to know something.

01:07:11.963 --> 01:07:13.130
What's my name?

01:07:14.213 --> 01:07:15.463
I... I don't know.

01:07:15.546 --> 01:07:17.963
What about your buddy back there?
What's his name?

01:07:19.255 --> 01:07:20.171
I don't know.

01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:22.171
He said he couldn't tell me.

01:07:22.255 --> 01:07:26.630
Okay, I want you to be real careful...
about what you're about to say

01:07:26.713 --> 01:07:30.713
because the only thing
that ties us to them is you.

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:36.921
Now, when you finally had sex,

01:07:37.005 --> 01:07:40.088
and you rolled over and looked him
in the eye and said,

01:07:40.171 --> 01:07:42.796
"What's your real name?"
What did he say?

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:44.088
That never happened.

01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:45.963
I can just go ask him.

01:07:46.338 --> 01:07:48.338
He never told me where he was from.

01:07:48.838 --> 01:07:50.671
He said that you served together...

01:07:52.296 --> 01:07:53.546
and that you were honest.

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:56.213
Why'd he say that?

01:07:56.838 --> 01:07:58.171
Because I asked him if...

01:08:00.046 --> 01:08:02.005
if he wasn't afraid of you cheating him.

01:08:02.838 --> 01:08:03.755
That's why.

01:08:04.588 --> 01:08:05.838
Everything all right?

01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:09.213
No!

01:08:13.671 --> 01:08:15.755
Here's three million dollars.

01:08:16.796 --> 01:08:20.255
And two tickets
with visas to Sydney, Australia.

01:08:21.296 --> 01:08:25.587
On the way to the airport,
stop at this shipping company.

01:08:26.296 --> 01:08:29.712
Make sure to send the boxes
to this hotel in Sydney.

01:08:31.130 --> 01:08:34.046
You know that's a lot more
than 75 million dollars in there.

01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:37.046
What does that mean?

01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:39.212
It's not just Lorea's money in there.

01:08:40.046 --> 01:08:42.130
A lot more people
are gonna come looking after you.

01:08:42.712 --> 01:08:47.296
I can deal with that.
But do not stay in South America

01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:50.421
because they will find you
and they will kill you.

01:08:51.087 --> 01:08:53.005
Promise me that you won't stay here.

01:08:53.087 --> 01:08:53.962
- Yes!
- Promise me!

01:08:54.046 --> 01:08:55.130
I promise you.

01:08:56.005 --> 01:08:58.462
How... How do I contact you?

01:08:59.005 --> 01:09:00.005
You can't.

01:09:03.296 --> 01:09:05.505
You did everything right.

01:09:06.212 --> 01:09:07.546
You deserve this.

01:09:11.212 --> 01:09:12.671
Take care of yourselves.

01:09:12.755 --> 01:09:14.046
Thank you.

01:09:14.837 --> 01:09:15.712
Go!

01:09:38.546 --> 01:09:39.755
She's lying.

01:09:41.546 --> 01:09:42.546
No, she's not.

01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:46.755
There are consequences to this shit.

01:09:48.671 --> 01:09:50.296
You know what we should have done?

01:09:54.505 --> 01:09:56.463
That's one you wouldn't come back from.

01:10:10.755 --> 01:10:12.338
<i>The weight drags</i>
<i>at higher altitudes.</i>

01:10:12.421 --> 01:10:15.130
<i>I'd like to stay under 5,000 feet
till we hit the Andes.</i>

01:10:15.713 --> 01:10:17.338
Ocean in four hours.

01:10:17.421 --> 01:10:19.088
Roger that. Nice work.

01:10:31.671 --> 01:10:34.088
I'm gonna try
between these two bigger peaks.

01:10:34.671 --> 01:10:36.296
Find this valley I saw on the map.

01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:37.380
Roger.

01:11:07.088 --> 01:11:09.421
Just one last push
through the Andes.

01:11:14.338 --> 01:11:16.088
<i>How high do you think that is?</i>

01:11:16.338 --> 01:11:19.046
<i>It's gotta be 11,000. Can't fly that high.</i>

01:11:19.838 --> 01:11:22.921
<i>Shouldn't have to.</i>
<i>Head for that lower ridge.</i>

01:11:24.630 --> 01:11:26.213
How are we doing up here, boys?

01:11:28.421 --> 01:11:29.421
Can we make it over?

01:11:30.171 --> 01:11:31.046
I don't know.

01:11:31.755 --> 01:11:33.505
What the fuck is going on up here?

01:11:33.588 --> 01:11:34.421
Go for it.

01:11:38.921 --> 01:11:40.630
All right, baby. All right, baby.

01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:42.588
Come on, now.

01:11:46.005 --> 01:11:47.963
All right, baby.

01:11:48.046 --> 01:11:50.296
- We're redlining, man.
- It's close, though.

01:11:56.171 --> 01:11:57.921
It's too much weight.
It's too much fucking weight.

01:11:58.713 --> 01:12:00.171
<i>We're never gonna make it.</i>

01:12:01.046 --> 01:12:03.296
- What does that mean?
- It means we're losing fucking money.

01:12:03.755 --> 01:12:05.838
You wanna leave $50 million
in the middle of the jungle?

01:12:05.921 --> 01:12:07.380
Do you wanna get to the ocean?

01:12:07.963 --> 01:12:09.588
All right, go do it.

01:12:12.838 --> 01:12:13.713
I got it!

01:12:37.130 --> 01:12:40.088
All right, let me check.

01:12:49.630 --> 01:12:51.338
How's she feeling now?

01:12:52.171 --> 01:12:53.755
That's feeling better.

01:12:54.171 --> 01:12:56.463
Come on. Come on.

01:13:04.755 --> 01:13:05.671
Come on.

01:13:22.296 --> 01:13:24.213
What the fuck are you doing, Catfish?

01:13:24.296 --> 01:13:26.088
One of the gearboxes is blown.

01:13:26.421 --> 01:13:27.338
What?

01:13:27.713 --> 01:13:29.338
I don't want to go into a spin.

01:13:37.421 --> 01:13:39.296
Okay, we might be in trouble here.

01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:45.796
<i>I'm losing altitude.</i>

01:13:45.963 --> 01:13:48.796
Ah, we should land. We should land now.

01:13:49.130 --> 01:13:50.755
Crash-land here, and we all die.

01:13:51.296 --> 01:13:53.130
I'm trying to get her back to flat.

01:13:53.213 --> 01:13:55.005
Roger. Prepare for a hard landing!

01:13:59.005 --> 01:14:01.421
<i>There should be a farmer's field</i>
<i>on the other side of that ridge.</i>

01:14:02.088 --> 01:14:04.755
<i>- We passed it on the way up.</i>
<i>- I remember it.</i>

01:14:10.838 --> 01:14:12.921
<i>I can't land this with that bag under us.</i>

01:14:13.005 --> 01:14:15.005
We should lose the money,
maybe we don't die.

01:14:15.838 --> 01:14:18.921
Lose the money, or we're all gonna die!

01:14:19.005 --> 01:14:22.171
<i>Hit the external load release.
It's on the wall!</i>

01:14:22.963 --> 01:14:24.505
Pull the lever, Ben!

01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:33.421
It didn't work!

01:14:35.296 --> 01:14:37.046
<i>There should be a manual override</i>

01:14:37.130 --> 01:14:38.088
<i>on the cargo hook.</i>

01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:40.963
Let me through!

01:14:59.713 --> 01:15:01.671
Benny!

01:15:03.671 --> 01:15:05.213
All right, I'm gonna try to land here.

01:15:10.588 --> 01:15:11.838
I gotta jump!

01:15:15.463 --> 01:15:17.588
Benny!

01:15:22.963 --> 01:15:23.963
Bad landing.

01:15:52.838 --> 01:15:54.755
Fish! Fish!

01:15:56.713 --> 01:15:59.546
- You all right?
- Yeah, I think so. I think so.

01:16:00.338 --> 01:16:01.296
Yo, Benny!

01:16:02.005 --> 01:16:03.130
Benny!

01:16:03.213 --> 01:16:05.713
- I'm here!
- Come on, we gotta move.

01:16:06.505 --> 01:16:07.963
Come on!

01:16:09.255 --> 01:16:11.338
Let's get our shit outta here.

01:16:11.421 --> 01:16:12.796
Try and get up to it.

01:16:13.213 --> 01:16:15.630
- Fish!
- I need oxygen.

01:16:17.713 --> 01:16:20.046
Everybody okay?

01:16:20.130 --> 01:16:21.171
Yeah.

01:16:25.963 --> 01:16:27.671
Whoa, whoa!

01:16:29.171 --> 01:16:31.880
- They're into the fucking net.
- What's the plan here?

01:16:31.963 --> 01:16:34.505
We're gonna get that money
over that mountain to the ocean.

01:16:34.588 --> 01:16:37.296
Benny, cover us
from under that tree line there.

01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:40.546
Fish, you take position up there.

01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:43.296
That's cocaine they're growing,
so they may have weapons trained on us

01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:44.671
from those buildings right there.

01:16:45.046 --> 01:16:46.463
We got working radios?

01:16:46.630 --> 01:16:48.713
- No, comms are dead.
- Go with hand signals.

01:16:48.921 --> 01:16:51.713
Pope and I will get out there
and look as peaceful as we can.

01:16:53.713 --> 01:16:55.838
We'll give you a hand signal
when we think it's secure.

01:16:56.421 --> 01:16:57.588
- Let's move.
- Benny.

01:17:17.255 --> 01:17:19.755
Please step back. Sirs!

01:17:19.838 --> 01:17:22.171
Step back, please, that is not yours.

01:17:22.255 --> 01:17:23.213
Who are you?

01:17:23.713 --> 01:17:24.838
Who are you with?

01:17:25.588 --> 01:17:26.838
We're with the army.

01:17:27.213 --> 01:17:28.296
We are advisers.

01:17:28.963 --> 01:17:31.546
You should call a rescue helicopter.

01:17:31.963 --> 01:17:33.338
- It's coming.
- Yes.

01:17:33.421 --> 01:17:36.088
In the meantime,
you are alone and don't have any uniforms.

01:17:38.130 --> 01:17:39.796
Okay, that can be resolved.

01:17:40.171 --> 01:17:43.005
But what about the other passengers
from the accident?

01:17:43.463 --> 01:17:44.380
We can talk about that.

01:17:44.463 --> 01:17:47.338
But tell your people
to stop stealing our property.

01:17:48.255 --> 01:17:49.796
These are our lands.

01:17:50.255 --> 01:17:51.130
You fucked up, DEA.

01:17:51.213 --> 01:17:53.421
No, no, no. Calm down. Calm down.

01:17:53.713 --> 01:17:55.588
Sir, careful with that weapon.

01:17:55.963 --> 01:17:58.713
- We're not DEA. We're not DEA.
- We are calm.

01:17:58.796 --> 01:18:02.296
- Tell your guy to put his gun down.
- Stay calm. Stop.

01:18:04.296 --> 01:18:06.505
Pope, what's he reaching for?
A weapon?

01:18:09.005 --> 01:18:10.213
Pope, do you cop...

01:18:11.838 --> 01:18:14.505
Stay right there. Don't get any closer.

01:18:22.796 --> 01:18:24.838
Fuck! What the hell, man?

01:18:25.546 --> 01:18:26.671
No!

01:18:27.796 --> 01:18:30.755
- Assholes! Murderers!
- Get out of there!

01:18:30.838 --> 01:18:33.088
Get away from the money!
Get away from there!

01:18:33.171 --> 01:18:35.546
- Fuck!
- No!

01:18:35.630 --> 01:18:38.921
We need horses or mules,
please, and then we will get out of here.

01:18:39.005 --> 01:18:41.588
Benny, get these people
back up toward the village.

01:18:41.671 --> 01:18:44.005
Fish, get this money on some mules.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:18:44.088 --> 01:18:46.005
Get back!

01:18:48.130 --> 01:18:49.130
Get up!

01:18:52.088 --> 01:18:54.213
Get up! Get up, lady!

01:19:01.630 --> 01:19:03.296
Send me to God.

01:19:14.171 --> 01:19:15.671
Go! Keep going!

01:19:17.421 --> 01:19:18.921
Fuck.

01:19:36.630 --> 01:19:40.005
All right, let's get these donkeys
saddled up, get the bags on 'em.

01:19:40.088 --> 01:19:41.255
Where's Pope?

01:19:41.338 --> 01:19:42.255
He's up there.

01:20:30.546 --> 01:20:32.296
That is for the mules.

01:20:38.046 --> 01:20:39.213
That is for the families.

01:20:51.921 --> 01:20:53.005
That is for you.

01:20:55.713 --> 01:20:56.838
Are we in agreement?

01:21:05.005 --> 01:21:06.130
Good.

01:21:06.963 --> 01:21:08.921
We're very sorry for what happened.

01:21:12.713 --> 01:21:14.921
And we very much appreciate
your cooperation.

01:21:41.796 --> 01:21:43.713
Come on.

01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:00.713
Sorry, kid.

01:22:05.088 --> 01:22:07.255
Those men have paid their debt!

01:22:07.671 --> 01:22:09.130
Let them pass.

01:22:48.213 --> 01:22:50.130
Did you pay for the damage?

01:22:51.046 --> 01:22:52.088
Yeah.

01:22:53.255 --> 01:22:54.213
How much?

01:22:55.005 --> 01:22:57.963
Two hundred for the animals.
A million for the families.

01:23:06.380 --> 01:23:07.796
Which one of you shot first?

01:23:10.130 --> 01:23:11.255
I don't know.

01:23:16.630 --> 01:23:18.088
We need to watch ourselves here.

01:23:19.546 --> 01:23:20.505
Yeah, we do.

01:23:21.255 --> 01:23:22.838
What the hell does that mean?

01:23:24.713 --> 01:23:25.796
Nothin'.

01:23:27.380 --> 01:23:29.838
It just means we gotta watch ourselves,
that's all.

01:23:30.338 --> 01:23:31.213
Roger that.

01:23:47.796 --> 01:23:48.963
How far have we gone?

01:23:50.546 --> 01:23:52.130
We've gone about 12 clicks.

01:23:53.213 --> 01:23:56.338
To get to the boat,
it's another day and a half, maybe two.

01:23:56.796 --> 01:23:58.630
Well, a fire would be righteous.

01:23:59.005 --> 01:24:00.880
Lorea's guys will be on our tail.

01:24:01.088 --> 01:24:03.588
Smoke from a fire will give us away.
We cold camp.

01:24:08.796 --> 01:24:10.796
Well, we're dancing with the devil now.

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:12.921
Dancing?

01:24:13.546 --> 01:24:15.838
We were dancing when we got on the plane
to come down here.

01:24:15.921 --> 01:24:18.213
I would call this full intercourse.

01:24:23.546 --> 01:24:25.046
How you doing, bud?

01:24:26.088 --> 01:24:27.463
Golden.

01:24:28.921 --> 01:24:29.796
Here.

01:24:33.130 --> 01:24:34.796
You're a good man, Benny.

01:24:36.671 --> 01:24:38.505
We're a dyin' breed, boys.

01:24:41.546 --> 01:24:42.755
No, we're not.

01:24:43.255 --> 01:24:46.671
The world's always going to need somebody
to go door-to-door to hold the line.

01:24:47.755 --> 01:24:49.921
Cops go door-to-door and hold the line.

01:24:52.171 --> 01:24:53.463
We were warriors.

01:24:55.755 --> 01:24:57.963
Well,
it's hard to remember that sometimes.

01:24:59.963 --> 01:25:01.005
Yeah, it is.

01:25:03.213 --> 01:25:04.588
What are you talking about?

01:25:06.338 --> 01:25:08.838
I was too quick on the trigger.
You know it, and I know it.

01:25:12.963 --> 01:25:14.171
I killed those people.

01:25:16.630 --> 01:25:17.505
No, you didn't.

01:25:20.338 --> 01:25:21.338
We all did.

01:26:42.255 --> 01:26:44.796
This is definitely
the old smuggler's trail!

01:26:46.671 --> 01:26:49.005
We should just keep following it
all the way up.

01:26:51.338 --> 01:26:52.338
Come on.

01:26:56.755 --> 01:26:58.588
Stop pushing on me, man.
It's steep here.

01:26:58.921 --> 01:27:02.046
Obviously, man,
we're on the side of a fucking mountain!

01:27:02.130 --> 01:27:05.255
Just shut up and concentrate!
Jesus Christ!

01:27:05.671 --> 01:27:07.338
- Come on, just go.
- Fuck you.

01:27:07.421 --> 01:27:09.421
Oh, really?

01:27:09.505 --> 01:27:10.505
Keep going!

01:27:10.588 --> 01:27:12.130
- Stop.
- You wanna do this?

01:27:14.421 --> 01:27:15.380
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

01:27:28.338 --> 01:27:29.296
Oh, fuck!

01:27:32.255 --> 01:27:35.546
What the fuck are you laughing at?

01:27:36.671 --> 01:27:38.213
That was a living animal, man.

01:27:38.588 --> 01:27:42.046
It could have been any one of us.
You're worried about the fucking donkey?

01:27:42.130 --> 01:27:44.088
You need to get your shit straight here,
man.

01:27:44.338 --> 01:27:46.088
- What? Me?
- Yeah, you.

01:27:46.171 --> 01:27:47.171
You're pointing fingers at me?

01:27:47.255 --> 01:27:49.755
- You're the reason we're in this mess.
- Oh, how the fuck is that?

01:27:49.838 --> 01:27:52.671
Yeah, you had to grab every dollar
you could get your hands on, didn't you?

01:27:52.755 --> 01:27:55.463
You could have gotten Lorea
two months ago! We didn't need to be here.

01:27:55.546 --> 01:27:56.380
All right.

01:27:57.005 --> 01:27:57.963
Fucking bullshit!

01:27:58.046 --> 01:27:59.630
We're all on the hook, are we not?

01:27:59.713 --> 01:28:01.921
God damn this fucking horse!
Stop it!

01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:04.130
- Yes. It's fine.
- Relax. Relax.

01:28:05.796 --> 01:28:08.255
We're not picking at the fucking scab
right now, okay?

01:28:09.130 --> 01:28:10.713
One foot in front of the other.

01:28:10.796 --> 01:28:11.838
All right? Come on.

01:28:12.171 --> 01:28:14.005
Let's go. Jesus fucking Christ.

01:28:40.421 --> 01:28:41.588
Oh, come on.

01:28:44.838 --> 01:28:47.296
Are you sure you want me
to get rid of the mules?

01:28:47.463 --> 01:28:51.338
This rock side's 20-foot deep.
We're not getting the mules through.

01:28:55.005 --> 01:28:56.880
Yeah, it's on us now!

01:28:58.963 --> 01:29:01.755
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

01:29:06.046 --> 01:29:07.296
Look at the mules.

01:29:09.255 --> 01:29:11.296
Well, if we can get over this,

01:29:11.380 --> 01:29:13.630
it should be all downhill
to the ocean from here.

01:29:23.296 --> 01:29:24.963
I got it. I got it. I got it.

01:29:32.171 --> 01:29:34.255
All right, come on up!

01:29:36.588 --> 01:29:38.171
- Nice work.
- You, too.

01:29:41.505 --> 01:29:43.505
Look, I talked a lot of shit back there.

01:29:43.588 --> 01:29:44.755
I didn't mean that.

01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:47.630
- Don't worry about it.
- No, no, it's...

01:29:48.380 --> 01:29:49.338
This is on me.

01:29:51.046 --> 01:29:53.046
- It's... all on me.
- No, man, it's...

01:29:54.338 --> 01:29:55.588
I'm on the hook for this.

01:29:56.630 --> 01:29:58.921
You know? It is what it is.

01:30:00.630 --> 01:30:02.546
Yeah, it is what it is.

01:30:05.630 --> 01:30:08.296
I <i>am </i> a bit of a dick, though.

01:30:29.088 --> 01:30:31.588
You could freeze an Eskimo's asshole
out here.

01:30:33.046 --> 01:30:34.255
I demand a fire.

01:30:36.255 --> 01:30:38.046
We cold camp.

01:30:54.005 --> 01:30:55.005
Fuck you.

01:30:56.713 --> 01:30:58.421
This is my "fuck you" money.

01:30:59.755 --> 01:31:01.546
Dude, what the fuck are you doing?

01:31:06.588 --> 01:31:08.588
We don't have enough men
to carry this money,

01:31:08.671 --> 01:31:10.255
so we might as well be warm.

01:31:24.421 --> 01:31:25.296
Oh, Jesus.

01:31:26.255 --> 01:31:28.130
Jesus Christ.

01:31:31.921 --> 01:31:33.005
Ah.

01:31:41.463 --> 01:31:44.630
- That's more like it.
<i>- Este loco...</i>

01:31:47.463 --> 01:31:50.713
Oh! Oh, my God! Holy shit.

01:31:52.921 --> 01:31:54.213
Now that's a fire!

01:32:32.130 --> 01:32:34.713
- Oh, shit! Shit.
- Ah, Fuck.

01:32:34.796 --> 01:32:35.755
I'm hit!

01:32:38.421 --> 01:32:42.130
- Benny, you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Just grazed my shoulder.

01:32:42.838 --> 01:32:44.421
Shooter's up on the ridge line.

01:32:48.630 --> 01:32:51.505
Oh, he likes me so much.
I'll stay here, hold his fire.

01:32:51.588 --> 01:32:52.713
You guys go around the side.

01:32:54.255 --> 01:32:55.838
Pope, can you step out?

01:32:56.713 --> 01:32:57.921
Work up the trailhead.

01:32:58.546 --> 01:32:59.463
All right.

01:33:00.005 --> 01:33:02.005
Flank right, make sure no one else
is coming up below.

01:33:03.046 --> 01:33:04.046
I'll cut up behind you.

01:33:05.296 --> 01:33:06.130
Benny, you all right?

01:33:06.213 --> 01:33:09.880
Yeah, I'm fine. We'll hold
down here until you get into position.

01:33:30.046 --> 01:33:32.005
I think Pope's in position right now.

01:33:32.088 --> 01:33:33.130
Yeah, let's move.

01:35:03.546 --> 01:35:04.713
Tom!

01:35:04.921 --> 01:35:06.088
Tom!

01:35:06.421 --> 01:35:09.255
Tom. Come on... Come on.

01:35:18.338 --> 01:35:20.963
Come on, Tom. Come on, man.

01:35:21.296 --> 01:35:23.588
Come on, man. Come on...

01:35:30.338 --> 01:35:31.880
Let me see. Let me see.

01:35:34.921 --> 01:35:36.421
Oh, my God!

01:35:49.796 --> 01:35:51.088
Let's get him wrapped up.

01:35:51.838 --> 01:35:53.130
We need to keep moving.

01:35:55.880 --> 01:35:58.796
What the fuck are you talking about?

01:35:59.380 --> 01:36:01.671
You're a heartless son of a bitch!

01:36:02.255 --> 01:36:05.630
It was your little fire
that got him fucking killed!

01:36:16.213 --> 01:36:17.296
Stop it.

01:36:19.630 --> 01:36:21.338
Stop this shit. Stop this shit.

01:36:21.421 --> 01:36:23.296
Fucking stop this!

01:36:23.380 --> 01:36:25.755
Stop this shit! Stop it!

01:36:25.838 --> 01:36:28.671
- Stop this shit!
- Fuck you, Benny! Fuck you!

01:36:29.546 --> 01:36:32.255
It wasn't the fire that gave us away.

01:36:33.671 --> 01:36:34.838
That kid was from the village.

01:36:36.713 --> 01:36:38.630
He's been tracking us for days.

01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:42.171
He obviously wanted a clear shot at Tom.

01:36:43.838 --> 01:36:44.796
He wanted him.

01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:50.921
But we do have to get
the fuck out of here,

01:36:51.005 --> 01:36:53.171
and we are taking
all of that money with us.

01:36:53.796 --> 01:36:55.630
Tom's family deserves it!

01:36:56.755 --> 01:36:57.713
And so do we.

01:37:01.255 --> 01:37:03.296
All right, let's wrap him up.
We carry him down.

01:37:28.255 --> 01:37:29.630
Rest in peace, brother.

01:37:33.338 --> 01:37:35.296
You rest in peace.

01:39:00.505 --> 01:39:02.630
How late are we
to meet the guy with the boat?

01:39:03.338 --> 01:39:04.296
Five days.

01:39:05.088 --> 01:39:07.421
Jesus. You think he's still there?

01:39:10.005 --> 01:39:11.296
I can't see shit.

01:39:14.963 --> 01:39:16.505
We need to get one of us down there.

01:39:18.046 --> 01:39:20.421
Think one of you can make it
there and back?

01:39:21.963 --> 01:39:22.838
I'll go.

01:39:24.796 --> 01:39:25.963
Your Spanish sucks, Benny.

01:39:27.630 --> 01:39:28.671
I got it.

01:39:30.005 --> 01:39:31.088
You sure?

01:39:34.963 --> 01:39:35.796
Three?

01:39:36.296 --> 01:39:37.130
Yeah.

01:39:39.046 --> 01:39:40.963
You're looking for the <i>Hijo Pródigo.</i>

01:39:50.338 --> 01:39:51.796
Benny, watch your six.

01:39:53.588 --> 01:39:54.630
You watch yours.

01:40:17.463 --> 01:40:19.463
I'm gonna say something.
Are you listening?

01:40:21.546 --> 01:40:22.380
Yeah.

01:40:23.838 --> 01:40:25.421
We gotta get back on our game.

01:40:27.005 --> 01:40:29.338
Enough of this. It stops now.
You understand?

01:40:31.171 --> 01:40:32.213
Copy that.

01:40:33.005 --> 01:40:33.880
Good.

01:40:38.171 --> 01:40:39.963
How many people
do you think you've killed?

01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:42.796
What?

01:40:43.046 --> 01:40:44.046
You heard me.

01:40:46.921 --> 01:40:48.213
As many as I had to.

01:40:48.713 --> 01:40:50.171
Why would you ever wanna know that?

01:40:53.463 --> 01:40:55.463
- Forty-three.
- Jesus!

01:40:56.588 --> 01:40:57.463
Confirmed.

01:40:58.588 --> 01:41:00.713
You keep count of everything, huh?

01:41:02.630 --> 01:41:03.505
Yep.

01:41:04.421 --> 01:41:05.421
How's your sleep?

01:41:09.338 --> 01:41:11.005
I guess better than it should be.

01:41:35.171 --> 01:41:36.046
You all right?

01:41:37.171 --> 01:41:38.421
The boat's there.

01:41:39.963 --> 01:41:41.463
I gave him half the money.

01:41:41.755 --> 01:41:42.796
I hope he waits.

01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:45.588
I didn't go into town,

01:41:46.046 --> 01:41:49.005
but it looks like
whoever's in charge there...

01:41:50.380 --> 01:41:53.463
has a... kindergarten army
that's looking for us.

01:41:53.630 --> 01:41:56.546
- How many of them?
- Two or three pros,

01:41:58.380 --> 01:42:00.005
20 heavily-armed teenagers.

01:42:00.463 --> 01:42:01.838
What about the next town over?

01:42:01.921 --> 01:42:03.838
It's over 100 miles to the south.

01:42:04.088 --> 01:42:06.380
I'm sure they've got
every town covered anyway.

01:42:07.296 --> 01:42:09.505
Must be what's left of Lorea's guys.

01:42:09.796 --> 01:42:10.921
So we go through 'em.

01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:14.755
Through them?

01:42:14.963 --> 01:42:16.505
What, do you mean we mow them all down?

01:42:16.588 --> 01:42:17.755
What's the alternative here?

01:42:18.796 --> 01:42:22.213
I'm not prepared
to wipe out every teenager in that town

01:42:22.463 --> 01:42:24.505
just to get through with this cargo.

01:42:24.796 --> 01:42:25.921
This cargo?

01:42:27.296 --> 01:42:28.755
What about that cargo?

01:42:29.796 --> 01:42:31.088
Will you do it for him?

01:42:33.130 --> 01:42:34.380
Tom died for this money,

01:42:34.463 --> 01:42:36.088
and we're not leaving this country
without it!

01:42:36.171 --> 01:42:38.796
He didn't die <i>for </i> that money,
he died <i>because </i> of it!

01:42:45.255 --> 01:42:46.630
They're just kids, man.

01:42:46.713 --> 01:42:48.338
Can't we carry it out through the dark?

01:42:48.796 --> 01:42:50.921
It's over 100 bags.
There's no way.

01:42:51.838 --> 01:42:53.088
Let me talk to him.

01:43:00.588 --> 01:43:02.880
Look, Benny's telling us these are kids,
man.

01:43:07.296 --> 01:43:10.338
I can't believe...
I can't believe I let this happen.

01:43:11.921 --> 01:43:14.588
Look, we all came here
of our own free will.

01:43:16.171 --> 01:43:17.046
Yeah, but...

01:43:17.546 --> 01:43:20.796
I thought we could...
I thought we could do this.

01:43:23.046 --> 01:43:24.130
Yeah.

01:43:25.588 --> 01:43:27.171
And we got what we deserved.

01:43:29.463 --> 01:43:30.421
I'm sorry.

01:43:31.755 --> 01:43:32.588
Yeah, me, too.

01:43:33.796 --> 01:43:35.588
- But we can't do this.
- I know.

01:43:36.421 --> 01:43:37.380
I know.

01:43:48.671 --> 01:43:51.505
We can't just... go through 'em.

01:43:52.421 --> 01:43:53.921
I don't know what I was saying.

01:43:55.505 --> 01:43:56.380
It's all right.

01:43:57.088 --> 01:43:58.588
We've just gotta get Tom home.

01:43:59.546 --> 01:44:00.588
That's all that matters.

01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:03.255
How are we gonna do that?

01:44:03.671 --> 01:44:05.171
We keep carrying him down.

01:44:06.088 --> 01:44:08.213
We fill our days packs
with whatever we can...

01:44:09.088 --> 01:44:11.046
Whatever we can carry, and that's it.

01:44:12.005 --> 01:44:13.505
What do we do with the rest of it?

01:44:32.171 --> 01:44:33.130
Fuck.

01:44:40.921 --> 01:44:43.171
Fuck me.

01:44:43.671 --> 01:44:44.505
That'll work.

01:44:45.255 --> 01:44:46.838
Snow will be coming in soon.

01:44:48.671 --> 01:44:50.255
Nobody'll ever see it again.

01:44:51.838 --> 01:44:52.755
Good.

01:44:56.838 --> 01:44:58.130
All right, let's keep going.

01:45:27.880 --> 01:45:30.005
Let's put him down for a second.

01:45:37.505 --> 01:45:38.838
We're running behind.

01:45:38.921 --> 01:45:40.880
Benny, you should go.
The sun's coming up.

01:45:41.838 --> 01:45:43.713
We'll meet you down at the cove in 30.

01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:47.296
- All right. Be careful.
- Always.

01:46:42.713 --> 01:46:44.421
Thank you for waiting.

01:46:46.005 --> 01:46:47.588
The boat is ready.

01:46:53.505 --> 01:46:54.963
No, wait. Whoa.

01:46:56.546 --> 01:46:57.505
Is there anyone?

01:46:59.338 --> 01:47:01.338
- It looks abandoned.
- Cover me.

01:47:05.046 --> 01:47:06.546
Stop! Hands up!

01:47:06.630 --> 01:47:09.588
- Stop!
- Put your hands up!

01:47:09.671 --> 01:47:11.130
Wait! Wait!

01:47:14.296 --> 01:47:15.171
Listen!

01:47:16.380 --> 01:47:19.505
Little brother, be careful with that gun.
Don't point it at me.

01:47:19.588 --> 01:47:23.130
I speak English!
What's in the bag? What is that?

01:47:23.213 --> 01:47:24.171
It's our friend.

01:47:24.921 --> 01:47:27.546
- He's dead.
- I call boss.

01:47:27.630 --> 01:47:29.588
- No, don't do that.
- Stop!

01:47:31.005 --> 01:47:33.338
We don't have any problem with you.

01:47:34.005 --> 01:47:35.005
Right, guys?

01:47:35.088 --> 01:47:36.421
- We don't have a problem with him.
- No problem.

01:47:36.505 --> 01:47:39.296
- I'm taking a shot.
- No! No. Don't do that.

01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:40.880
It's okay.

01:47:40.963 --> 01:47:42.213
Uh-uh.

01:47:44.546 --> 01:47:46.213
Hey, calm down.

01:47:46.671 --> 01:47:48.921
This is 16! I need help!

01:47:51.588 --> 01:47:52.588
Dumbass!

01:47:52.671 --> 01:47:53.963
- Where are the keys?
- I don't know.

01:47:54.046 --> 01:47:56.880
They just left me here with just the car
and the radio.

01:47:57.088 --> 01:47:58.046
Fuck!

01:47:58.421 --> 01:47:59.546
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

01:47:59.630 --> 01:48:00.463
Are you lying?

01:48:00.546 --> 01:48:02.713
Hey, hey, kid, just relax, all right?

01:48:02.796 --> 01:48:05.838
<i>Sixteen? Sixteen, is that you?</i>

01:48:05.921 --> 01:48:07.880
<i>We're going to send someone.</i>

01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:12.755
Yes! Fuck yes!

01:48:12.838 --> 01:48:14.171
Let's move. Let's get it outta here.

01:48:15.171 --> 01:48:17.296
- Grab his radio.
- Got it.

01:48:22.255 --> 01:48:23.671
Here's a little advice:

01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:26.963
Get away from these men.

01:48:27.046 --> 01:48:28.130
Let's move!

01:48:28.213 --> 01:48:29.963
Go home. Get out of here.

01:48:30.046 --> 01:48:31.630
<i>Vamos,</i> Pope!

01:48:37.380 --> 01:48:39.380
Did you give that fucking kid money?

01:48:39.463 --> 01:48:41.880
We should have killed that kid
as soon as he saw our faces.

01:48:41.963 --> 01:48:43.713
We are not killing any more people.

01:48:44.171 --> 01:48:47.046
I'll tell you right now, if we get
to that beach and Ben isn't there,

01:48:47.130 --> 01:48:48.421
I'm fucking killing people.

01:48:48.505 --> 01:48:50.755
All right, he'll be there. Fuck!

01:48:53.630 --> 01:48:54.505
Shit.

01:48:56.505 --> 01:48:57.546
Fuck.

01:49:04.671 --> 01:49:06.630
- Come on! Come on!
- Can we go?

01:49:09.880 --> 01:49:10.796
What the hell is this?

01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:11.713
Shit!

01:49:11.796 --> 01:49:13.671
<i>They crashed</i>
<i>into us! Look out, be careful!</i>

01:49:13.755 --> 01:49:16.880
<i>- They're heading to the beach.</i>
<i>- They just passed.</i>

01:49:16.963 --> 01:49:19.171
<i>- Everybody head towards the palm trees.</i>
- What did he say?

01:49:19.255 --> 01:49:21.713
- More are coming.
- There's two vehicles!

01:49:21.796 --> 01:49:24.213
All right, it should open up
onto the beach any minute.

01:49:24.296 --> 01:49:25.463
Pope, shoot!

01:49:25.546 --> 01:49:26.380
Fuck!

01:49:26.463 --> 01:49:29.880
Shoot the driver! What is wrong with you?

01:49:30.963 --> 01:49:32.005
<i>Give some room!</i>

01:49:32.088 --> 01:49:34.046
- Left!
<i>- They're firing!</i>

01:49:35.380 --> 01:49:36.463
<i>Stay behind!</i>

01:49:58.588 --> 01:50:00.005
They're right on us!

01:50:11.213 --> 01:50:12.338
Where are they?

01:50:15.380 --> 01:50:16.630
Left! Left!

01:50:21.255 --> 01:50:22.255
Left!

01:50:25.338 --> 01:50:26.588
Goddamn!

01:50:27.755 --> 01:50:29.171
All right, here's the beach.

01:50:35.588 --> 01:50:37.171
Where is he? Do you see him?

01:50:37.963 --> 01:50:41.921
No, but the cove where we're supposed
to meet him's about a mile up this beach.

01:51:00.505 --> 01:51:01.755
Pope, kill them!

01:51:02.380 --> 01:51:03.755
Just kill them!

01:51:15.296 --> 01:51:16.588
There it is!

01:51:23.380 --> 01:51:25.505
- Do I wave him in?
- Hell yeah!

01:51:26.921 --> 01:51:27.921
Go!

01:51:28.171 --> 01:51:29.796
It looks like this is the end of the road.

01:51:29.880 --> 01:51:30.963
I see it.

01:51:31.255 --> 01:51:34.380
We gotta cross over the dune!
Cross over the dune!

01:51:55.296 --> 01:51:56.213
Let's go!

01:52:08.838 --> 01:52:09.838
Come on!

01:53:07.713 --> 01:53:10.796
<i>Minus the expenses,</i>
<i>and our administrative fee,</i>

01:53:11.255 --> 01:53:16.463
that leaves $5,334,120...

01:53:17.171 --> 01:53:18.296
cut five ways.

01:53:18.588 --> 01:53:23.630
Which gives you five shares of $1,066,824.

01:53:24.296 --> 01:53:27.755
Oh, and I need all of your signatures
on the fifth contract here.

01:53:28.296 --> 01:53:32.213
It'll deposit the deceased's share
into the Redfly Family Trust.

01:53:33.380 --> 01:53:34.338
Here you are.

01:53:50.671 --> 01:53:53.796
I'd like you to please include my share
into the family trust.

01:54:17.296 --> 01:54:18.213
Me, too.

01:54:25.505 --> 01:54:26.380
Thank you.

01:54:54.588 --> 01:54:57.755
So, I will schedule
all the payments to the family trust.

01:55:00.213 --> 01:55:01.130
Of course.

01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:06.005
- Thank you. That's for you.
- Thank you. I'll be in touch.

01:55:30.796 --> 01:55:33.130
So, what are you guys gonna do now?

01:55:35.421 --> 01:55:36.796
I gotta get home.

01:55:38.171 --> 01:55:39.380
Not without these.

01:55:44.963 --> 01:55:46.671
That'll help.

01:55:58.005 --> 01:55:59.088
See you.

01:56:03.005 --> 01:56:04.213
Take care of yourself.

01:56:11.130 --> 01:56:12.213
See you, buddy.

01:56:14.338 --> 01:56:15.380
Love you, man.

01:56:15.630 --> 01:56:17.088
I love you, too.

01:56:21.421 --> 01:56:23.421
- I'll see you in a bit, all right?
- See you.

01:56:32.046 --> 01:56:33.421
So, what you gonna do now?

01:56:36.421 --> 01:56:38.463
I don't know.

01:56:39.963 --> 01:56:41.005
Maybe I'll, uh...

01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:44.005
I'll go see this girl I know in Australia.

01:56:45.380 --> 01:56:49.338
Yeah, you should.
I hear she recently came into some money.

01:56:51.380 --> 01:56:53.130
I guess she made out
a whole hell of a lot better

01:56:53.213 --> 01:56:54.255
than any of us did.

01:56:55.421 --> 01:56:56.838
That seems about right.

01:57:00.588 --> 01:57:02.630
When you see Molly and the girls...

01:57:06.505 --> 01:57:08.713
remind them who he was.

01:57:09.380 --> 01:57:10.296
Yeah, I will.

01:57:18.588 --> 01:57:20.171
Take care of yourself, all right?

01:57:20.921 --> 01:57:21.755
You, too.

01:57:24.421 --> 01:57:27.088
Maybe we can go
do something good with it one day.
