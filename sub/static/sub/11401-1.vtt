00:36.802 --> 00:39.470
Doesn't look like
anyone's home.

00:39.471 --> 00:42.140
You mustn't give up
so easily, Albert.

00:42.141 --> 00:44.810
We've come all this way.
Let's just see.

00:56.021 --> 00:57.623
Hello?

00:59.224 --> 01:00.292
Hello?

01:02.961 --> 01:04.563
Anybody home?

01:07.232 --> 01:09.902
You know, I don't think
anyone's living here.

01:13.639 --> 01:15.239
I'm so sorry. I didn't
mean to frighten you.

01:15.240 --> 01:16.841
Oh, well...

01:16.842 --> 01:18.976
We didn't think
anyone was home.

01:18.977 --> 01:20.044
Oh.

01:20.045 --> 01:22.180
Have you been saved?

01:22.181 --> 01:23.247
Who, me?

01:23.248 --> 01:25.383
We're here spreading
the good word.

01:25.384 --> 01:29.120
Do you realize that the end
of the world is drawing near?

01:29.121 --> 01:31.255
As a matter of fact, I do.

01:31.256 --> 01:33.925
I was just about to
have a slice of cake!

01:33.926 --> 01:36.060
Would you two like to join me?

01:36.061 --> 01:38.196
Huh. Well, how kind.

01:38.197 --> 01:39.798
Yes, thank you.

01:45.137 --> 01:47.271
This is a big house
you have here.

01:47.272 --> 01:48.873
Must need a lot of upkeep.

01:48.874 --> 01:51.542
Not really.

01:51.543 --> 01:52.611
Ooh, yum.

02:01.687 --> 02:03.821
Well, I hope you're hungry.

02:03.822 --> 02:04.889
I think...

02:04.890 --> 02:07.024
we'll skip the cake.

02:07.025 --> 02:10.228
Oh, don't be silly.

02:10.229 --> 02:13.432
It's devil's food!

02:26.245 --> 02:28.380
Mmm.

04:07.679 --> 04:11.415
♪ I'm not a warrior ♪

04:11.416 --> 04:12.483
♪ But I am a lover ♪

04:12.484 --> 04:15.152

04:15.153 --> 04:17.822
Oh, turn around.

04:17.822 --> 04:19.423
Please turn around.

04:22.094 --> 04:24.228
Yes. Bingo!

04:24.229 --> 04:27.965
Hey, come on, Kurt.
I paid for half of those.

04:27.966 --> 04:29.033
Come on, you hog
them every night.

04:29.034 --> 04:30.101
It's my turn.

04:30.102 --> 04:32.771
Sorry. I'm sorry.
I was just bedazzled.

04:37.042 --> 04:39.710
Jesus, Perry, you just now
getting out of the bathroom?

04:39.711 --> 04:41.846
What the hell you been doing
there this whole time?

04:41.847 --> 04:43.447
Spanking your monkey again?

04:43.448 --> 04:45.049
Gee, how time flies.

04:45.050 --> 04:47.718
You're the one with
the binoculars.

04:55.727 --> 04:57.328

04:57.329 --> 04:58.930
Damn it, Kurt, they're turning
out the lights already.

04:58.931 --> 05:01.065
You can go first
tomorrow night.

05:01.066 --> 05:02.667
Tomorrow night's the dance.

05:02.668 --> 05:04.802
So?

05:04.803 --> 05:07.163
They'll still have to take their
clothes off when it's over.

05:09.074 --> 05:10.675
Bibi.

05:10.676 --> 05:11.743
Yes.

05:13.879 --> 05:17.615
The day after the party, the county
sheriff went in with his deputies.

05:17.616 --> 05:21.886
They found the kids, or rather,
what was left of them.

05:21.887 --> 05:26.691
Their bodies were chopped,
grated, sliced, and diced.

05:26.692 --> 05:27.758
Totally toasted.

05:27.759 --> 05:29.894
I'm talking ground round.

05:29.895 --> 05:30.962
Terri!

05:30.963 --> 05:32.563
Their relatives could
barely identify them.

05:32.564 --> 05:34.699
But they did.

05:34.700 --> 05:36.300
Every one of them.

05:36.301 --> 05:38.970
Every one except Angela.

05:38.971 --> 05:40.037
Angela?

05:40.038 --> 05:41.639
The girl who threw the party.

05:41.640 --> 05:44.308
They searched the
property over and over,

05:44.309 --> 05:46.444
hi and low,

05:46.445 --> 05:48.045
but never found her body.

05:48.046 --> 05:51.248
They say it's because she
descended into hell,

05:51.249 --> 05:53.384
body and soul,

05:53.385 --> 05:55.519
and now she's
Satan's favorite,

05:55.520 --> 05:58.723
sitting on his lap.

05:58.724 --> 06:00.859
She's probably sitting on
his big spike right now.

06:02.461 --> 06:06.731
There's some things that
you shouldn't joke about.

06:06.732 --> 06:07.798
Go to bed, Mouse.

06:07.799 --> 06:09.934
My name's Melissa.

06:09.935 --> 06:11.002
All right, Melissa.

06:11.003 --> 06:12.604
Go to bed.

06:14.740 --> 06:16.875
Before I cut your tail off.

06:18.477 --> 06:21.679
So this place, Hull House,

06:21.680 --> 06:23.280
it still exists?

06:23.281 --> 06:27.019
Oh, yeah. Right at the
end of Old Hull Road.

06:28.620 --> 06:31.288
Every so often, some kids
venture out there on a dare.

06:31.289 --> 06:32.356
Some of them come back

06:32.357 --> 06:35.026
insisting that Angela
is still in the house

06:35.027 --> 06:37.162
searching for her
missing party guests.

06:38.764 --> 06:41.432
Some claim to have actually
heard the swooshing

06:41.433 --> 06:43.567
of her long black
wedding dress

06:43.568 --> 06:46.237
as it sweeps against
the mildewed walls.

06:46.238 --> 06:48.906
Others claim to have
actually seen her,

06:48.907 --> 06:54.246
now a demon floating through
the long dark hallways,

06:55.847 --> 07:00.117
and some never
come back at all.

07:00.118 --> 07:01.185
Oh, right.

07:01.186 --> 07:02.253
Are you scared?

07:02.254 --> 07:03.855
You wish.

07:04.923 --> 07:08.126
Lights out.

07:46.565 --> 07:48.165
Mouse.

07:48.166 --> 07:49.768
Mouse, wake up.

07:56.174 --> 07:57.242
Angela?

07:59.377 --> 08:01.512
Am I dreaming?

08:01.513 --> 08:04.181
No, you're not
dreaming, silly.

08:04.182 --> 08:06.318
I'm right here, see?

08:07.919 --> 08:09.521
Smile, sis!

08:32.477 --> 08:33.544
Mouse!

08:33.544 --> 08:34.613
Come on.

08:36.214 --> 08:37.282
Terri.

08:54.900 --> 08:56.500
En garde.

08:56.501 --> 08:58.636
Coupè. Coulè.

08:58.637 --> 09:00.771
Tiercè.

09:00.772 --> 09:02.374
Touchè.

09:03.441 --> 09:05.042
Who is it?

09:05.043 --> 09:06.644
It's Father Bob, Sister.

09:06.645 --> 09:08.780
Come in.

09:10.382 --> 09:11.982
Good morning, Sister Gloria.

09:11.983 --> 09:13.584
Oh, good morning.

09:13.585 --> 09:15.186
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

09:15.187 --> 09:16.787
Oh, no, no, no, no. Come in.

09:16.788 --> 09:18.389
What can I do for you, Father?

09:18.390 --> 09:21.592
Well, um, the reason
I stopped by is

09:21.593 --> 09:24.795
I wanted to talk to you about
the school dance tonight.

09:24.796 --> 09:25.863
School dance?

09:25.864 --> 09:28.532
Yes, I thought it would
be a great opportunity

09:28.533 --> 09:32.269
for the kids to, well,
cut loose for a change.

09:32.270 --> 09:33.871
Cut loose?

09:33.872 --> 09:34.939
Yes, you know.

09:34.940 --> 09:37.608
Burn up some of that
youthful exuberance

09:37.609 --> 09:40.811
by having the kids get more
involved in running the dance

09:40.812 --> 09:43.480
and take some responsibility
for creating their own fun.

09:43.481 --> 09:44.548
What do you think?

09:44.549 --> 09:47.751
Well, Father, these
children are troubled

09:47.752 --> 09:50.421
and the parents send them
here for discipline.

09:50.422 --> 09:51.488
No, Sister.

09:51.489 --> 09:54.158
No, Sister, their
parents send them here

09:54.159 --> 09:56.293
in order for us to
help them adjust

09:56.294 --> 09:58.963
in growing up with the
pressures of today's world.

09:58.964 --> 10:02.700
What they need to learn
is responsibility,

10:02.701 --> 10:04.301
not discipline.

10:04.302 --> 10:08.038
But I've been running the
Halloween dance for 15 years now.

10:08.039 --> 10:09.640
Precisely!

10:09.641 --> 10:14.445
Now, all I'm asking is for a
little fresh input from the kids.

10:14.446 --> 10:17.114
Input? Father Edward
would never have--

10:17.115 --> 10:18.716
Father Edward is in
Somalia, Sister.

10:18.717 --> 10:23.520
Now, if you'd like, I'm sure I could
arrange a transfer to his clinic.

10:23.521 --> 10:27.258
Have you been
vaccinated for malaria?

10:27.259 --> 10:29.393
St. Rita's is my home, Father.

10:29.394 --> 10:32.596
Well, then, I'm sure
you'll make every effort

10:32.597 --> 10:34.732
to make it a happy one...

10:34.733 --> 10:37.935
for all of us,
including the kids.

10:37.936 --> 10:42.206
Look, just work
with them, Sister.

10:42.207 --> 10:43.807
Is that too much to ask?

10:43.808 --> 10:45.943
Whatever you say, Father.

10:45.944 --> 10:48.613
Good.

11:04.629 --> 11:05.696
Hi, there.

11:05.697 --> 11:06.764
You're Melissa, right?

11:06.765 --> 11:09.433
Yeah.

11:09.434 --> 11:11.035
Are you going to the dance?

11:11.036 --> 11:12.636
Dance?

11:12.637 --> 11:14.239
Yeah, you know, the
big Halloween dance.

11:15.840 --> 11:17.442
Maybe I'll see you there.

11:23.848 --> 11:25.983
I can't believe Mouse
is Angela's sister.

11:25.984 --> 11:29.186
Yeah, well, after she wakes up with a
few more of those screaming nightmares,

11:29.187 --> 11:30.788
maybe then you'll believe it.

11:30.789 --> 11:32.389
Does she do that often?

11:32.390 --> 11:34.525
Just about every other night.

11:34.526 --> 11:36.660
What a freak.

11:36.661 --> 11:38.262
Hey, Mouse is all right.

11:38.263 --> 11:41.465
She's just had it a
little rough, that's all.

11:41.466 --> 11:42.533
A little rough? Yeah.

11:42.534 --> 11:43.600
So who hasn't?

11:43.601 --> 11:45.202
Well, listen to this.

11:45.203 --> 11:47.338
About a year ago her
parents received

11:47.339 --> 11:48.939
a weird Halloween card.

11:48.940 --> 11:51.075
It was homemade and
really creepy,

11:51.076 --> 11:54.278
like, decorated with dead
bugs and dried blood.

11:54.279 --> 11:55.879
It was totally disgusting.

11:55.880 --> 11:58.549
Anyway, it was
signed by Angela.

11:58.550 --> 12:00.150
They really took it hard.

12:00.151 --> 12:02.820
Everyone tried to convince them
that it was just a really bad joke,

12:02.821 --> 12:06.023
but they swore that
it was her signature.

12:06.024 --> 12:08.692
That night, they both
committed suicide.

12:08.693 --> 12:10.294
Suicide?

12:10.295 --> 12:12.429
That's why she's here.

12:12.430 --> 12:14.031
She's an orphan.

12:14.032 --> 12:15.633
No shit.

12:17.769 --> 12:19.371
She's a charity case.

12:23.108 --> 12:25.242
Stop that vicious gossip.

12:25.243 --> 12:28.445
Whatever the truth is about
Melissa and her family,

12:28.446 --> 12:31.115
I want you all to show a
little bit more compassion

12:31.116 --> 12:32.182
for her in the future.

12:32.183 --> 12:35.387
Things are bad enough for
her without your abuse.

12:54.072 --> 12:55.672
Hey, beautiful.

12:55.673 --> 12:56.740
Tonight's the night.

12:56.741 --> 12:57.808
I can't wait.

12:57.809 --> 12:59.410
I had a dream about you.

12:59.411 --> 13:01.011
You did?

13:01.012 --> 13:03.147
Mm-hmm.

13:03.148 --> 13:05.283
Save a little room
for the Holy Ghost.

13:17.028 --> 13:18.096
Sorry.

13:26.104 --> 13:27.704
Thanks.

13:27.705 --> 13:29.306
You're such a gentleman.

13:29.307 --> 13:34.111
And these are things you will need
to know when you are married.

13:34.112 --> 13:38.916
Now, don't be shy, girls. I know that
this is an embarrassing subject,

13:38.917 --> 13:41.585
but if one doesn't
ask questions,

13:41.586 --> 13:45.322
one never learns, does one?

13:45.323 --> 13:46.390
Yes, Teresa?

13:46.391 --> 13:49.059
Sister, is it a sin
to kiss a boy?

13:49.060 --> 13:51.196
I mean, if you really,
really like him?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.669
A kiss is a sin

13:58.670 --> 14:00.270
when it is an upper persuasion

14:00.271 --> 14:02.407
for a lower invasion.

14:08.813 --> 14:10.414
Yes, Shirley?

14:10.415 --> 14:12.549
Sister Gloria,

14:12.550 --> 14:16.821
is fellatio a mortal
sin or a venial sin?

14:20.024 --> 14:22.694
Fellatio.

14:24.295 --> 14:26.431
I don't think I'm
familiar with that term.

14:29.100 --> 14:34.973
Could you please explain to the
class exactly what that means?

14:40.845 --> 14:42.980
What's the matter,
Miss Finnerty?

14:42.981 --> 14:45.650
Cat got your tongue?

14:48.319 --> 14:49.920
Oh, by the way, boys,

14:49.921 --> 14:53.123
Sister Gloria has
called my attention

14:53.124 --> 14:55.792
to the fact that several
imaginative rumors

14:55.793 --> 14:57.394
have been circulating throughout
the school

14:57.395 --> 14:59.530
regarding a certain
local landmark.

14:59.531 --> 15:01.665
Hull House.

15:01.666 --> 15:03.267
Yes, Kurt, that is correct.

15:03.268 --> 15:04.334
Hull House.

15:04.335 --> 15:07.004
A typical urban folktale.

15:07.005 --> 15:09.673
Folktales? Mm-hmm.

15:09.674 --> 15:11.808
You can't write that stuff
off as folktales, Father.

15:11.809 --> 15:13.944
Why not? Well, that stuff
really did happen.

15:13.945 --> 15:15.546
It's a matter of record.

15:15.547 --> 15:18.215
Well, of course, they
happened, Johnny,

15:18.216 --> 15:19.283
but things happen everywhere.

15:19.284 --> 15:21.952
Uh, excuse me, Father?

15:21.953 --> 15:25.155
Yes, Perry, what is it?

15:25.156 --> 15:27.824
Rather than blindly dismissing the
legend of Hull House completely,

15:27.825 --> 15:31.562
perhaps it would be more constructive
to discuss demonic phenomena

15:31.563 --> 15:33.164
from a religious perspective.

15:34.766 --> 15:36.900
Perry, this is a
catechism class,

15:36.901 --> 15:39.036
not Demonology 101.

15:39.037 --> 15:42.773
Yeah, but demonology is part
of our catechism, Father.

15:42.774 --> 15:44.374
Excuse me?

15:44.375 --> 15:47.044
Well, the church gets its directive
from Jesus Himself, right?

15:47.045 --> 15:48.111
Yes.

15:48.112 --> 15:49.713
Well, He cast out
demonic spirits

15:49.714 --> 15:51.848
no less than 26
times in the Bible.

15:51.849 --> 15:53.450
Well, yes,

15:53.451 --> 15:56.653
but why don't we discuss some
of Jesus' other teachings,

15:56.654 --> 15:59.323
such as love for all mankind?

15:59.324 --> 16:00.924
Father? Yes.

16:00.925 --> 16:05.195
You mean the kind of love
we get from Sister Gloria?

16:05.196 --> 16:07.331
Yeah, like on the tip
of her yardstick.

16:07.332 --> 16:10.000
All right, boys.
That's enough.

16:10.001 --> 16:11.068
Excuse me, Father. Yes?

16:11.069 --> 16:13.203
I have been researching demonic
possession.

16:13.204 --> 16:14.805
Well, therein lies
your problem, Perry.

16:14.806 --> 16:16.940
You're wasting your time reading
the wrong kind of books.

16:16.941 --> 16:19.077
Stick with this one.

16:20.678 --> 16:21.745
Go ahead, laugh.

16:21.746 --> 16:23.880
It won't be long before
somebody proves that

16:23.881 --> 16:26.550
demonic energies
do indeed exist.

16:26.551 --> 16:28.685
And maybe then, Father,
demonology will finally get

16:28.686 --> 16:30.821
the kind of scientific
credibility it deserves.

16:30.822 --> 16:33.490
Ah, yes, Perry, I'm sure it
will rank right up there

16:33.491 --> 16:36.159
with astrology and
trance channeling.

16:36.160 --> 16:41.499
And now my spirit guide
says it's time for...

16:42.567 --> 16:44.701
math.

16:44.702 --> 16:45.770
Open 'em up.

16:56.981 --> 16:58.048
Jordan's got the ball!

16:58.049 --> 16:59.116
He's charging down the line!

16:59.117 --> 17:00.717
He's got it. He's got it!

17:00.718 --> 17:01.785
It's 10, 9, 8--
It's going nowhere.

17:01.786 --> 17:03.387
He's got only one shot.

17:03.388 --> 17:04.454
He goes, shoots!

17:04.454 --> 17:06.589
Oh, man.

17:06.590 --> 17:08.724
Hey, butthead, what are you
looking for, a fat lip?

17:08.726 --> 17:09.792
I want my book.

17:09.794 --> 17:11.395
What book?

17:11.396 --> 17:12.462
Come on, you know what book.

17:12.463 --> 17:13.530
That's a rare text.

17:13.531 --> 17:14.598
It cost me a
month's allowance.

17:14.598 --> 17:16.199
What's the problem here?

17:16.200 --> 17:19.403
Oh, the old sexorcist here thinks I stole
his precious little ghoulie book.

17:19.404 --> 17:20.470
Yeah, so?

17:20.471 --> 17:23.140
So what would
I want with a book?

17:23.141 --> 17:24.207
Good point.

17:24.208 --> 17:26.343
Perry, Kurt doesn't
have your book.

17:26.344 --> 17:27.944
He can barely read a clock.

17:27.944 --> 17:29.012
Thank you. Sure.

17:29.013 --> 17:31.148
You guys think you're
so great just because

17:31.149 --> 17:33.283
you're bigger, tougher, and
better-looking than everybody else.

17:33.284 --> 17:34.351
I'm gonna show you that--

17:34.352 --> 17:35.952
He said he doesn't
have your book.

17:35.953 --> 17:38.622
I'm gonna prove
that demons exist.

17:38.623 --> 17:40.223
Yeah, well, you're
living proof.

17:40.224 --> 17:42.359
Look, why don't you go haunt
a house or something,

17:42.360 --> 17:43.640
let us finish our
lunch in peace?

17:46.097 --> 17:48.765
Whoa. Speaking of lunch.

17:48.766 --> 17:52.502
Ooh. Check out
those headlights.

17:52.503 --> 17:54.104
That's something that could
really brighten my day.

17:54.105 --> 17:57.307
That's what I'd call
double trouble.

17:57.308 --> 17:59.976
It's the kind of trouble I'd
like to get my hands on.

17:59.977 --> 18:01.578
Oh, yeah?

18:01.579 --> 18:03.180
So do it, dude,

18:03.181 --> 18:05.316
unless you left your balls
in your other Calvins.

18:10.655 --> 18:11.722
Just pay attention, junior.

18:11.723 --> 18:12.789
You just might learn something.

18:12.790 --> 18:14.391
From you?

18:14.392 --> 18:16.527
Just watch the bouncing ball.

18:21.332 --> 18:22.933
Looks like I caught something.

18:22.934 --> 18:25.068
Yeah, or something caught you.

18:25.069 --> 18:27.204
Sorry. Slippery fingers.

18:27.205 --> 18:29.873
Name's Kurt. Ladies
call me Kingsnake.

18:29.874 --> 18:33.077
Oh, really? I heard
they call you Inchworm.

18:34.679 --> 18:35.747
Yeah.

18:38.416 --> 18:39.483
Can I at least get
the ball back?

18:39.484 --> 18:41.085
Who's stopping you?

19:01.906 --> 19:04.041
I've got your ball.

19:05.643 --> 19:08.311
Maybe we should throw
ice water on them.

19:08.312 --> 19:10.447
Oh! Do you really think
that would stop them?

19:10.448 --> 19:11.448
Nah.

19:14.719 --> 19:16.319
Shit. Sister.

19:16.320 --> 19:17.922
Hey, Kurt.

19:20.591 --> 19:25.929
What in the holy name of
glory is going on here?

19:25.930 --> 19:29.666
I asked you a
question, young lady.

19:29.667 --> 19:32.335
What is going on?

19:32.336 --> 19:33.937
I see.

19:33.938 --> 19:36.072
Struck dumb by the
devil, are we?

19:36.073 --> 19:38.742
I knew from the
get-go I was going

19:38.743 --> 19:40.877
to have trouble with you,
Miss Shirley Finnerty.

19:40.878 --> 19:42.479
Kiss off, you old tyrant.
We were just--

19:42.480 --> 19:44.614
You are lucky, young lady,

19:44.615 --> 19:46.216
that there are laws
that prevent me

19:46.217 --> 19:48.351
from giving you the
punishment that you deserve.

19:48.352 --> 19:49.953
In the old days, I would've--

19:49.954 --> 19:51.556
Would've what?

19:55.293 --> 19:57.427
Well...

19:57.428 --> 20:02.232
I can see that you need time
to examine your conscience.

20:02.233 --> 20:05.436
Therefore you will remain
in the dormitory tonight.

20:07.038 --> 20:08.638
And that goes for your
friends here, too.

20:08.639 --> 20:10.240
But, Sister, the dance!

20:10.241 --> 20:11.842
Oh, hey, come on. We
didn't do anything.

20:11.843 --> 20:15.579
We'll just give those
raging teenage hormones

20:15.580 --> 20:17.181
a chance to cool down.

20:21.452 --> 20:25.189
You old witch.

20:43.875 --> 20:46.543
October 31st, 6:25 P.M.

20:46.544 --> 20:48.678
I am in the sacristy of St.
Rita's chapel

20:48.679 --> 20:51.882
preparing to conduct an
experiment of demon conjuration.

20:51.883 --> 20:54.551
I've chosen the sacristy
for three reasons.

20:54.552 --> 20:56.686
One, it is quiet.

20:56.687 --> 21:00.423
Two, it is the likely
vortex of mystical energy.

21:00.424 --> 21:02.560
Three, it's totally safe.

21:07.899 --> 21:08.965
This sucks.

21:08.966 --> 21:11.101
I have to set up for a dance
I'm not even invited to.

21:11.102 --> 21:13.770
Isn't this some sort of
child abuse or something?

21:13.771 --> 21:15.906
I'm gonna get a lawyer.

21:15.907 --> 21:17.507
The Church is worth
lots of money.

21:17.508 --> 21:18.575
I think we can get
rich off this.

21:18.576 --> 21:20.177
Yeah, right.

21:22.313 --> 21:23.380
Neil Diamond?

21:23.381 --> 21:24.981
This stuff is fossil fuel.

21:24.982 --> 21:27.651
This is Flintstones
top 10 countdown.

21:27.652 --> 21:29.252
Ooh, you're right.

21:29.253 --> 21:31.388
We're lucky we're not going to
old Gory's Jurassic hoe-down.

21:31.389 --> 21:32.455
You said it.

21:32.456 --> 21:34.057
Oh, Kurt.

21:34.058 --> 21:35.659
Got a minute?

21:35.660 --> 21:36.726
Who, me?

21:36.727 --> 21:38.328
Yeah, Einstein.

21:38.329 --> 21:40.997
Y-O-O. You.

21:40.998 --> 21:42.600
Yeah, sure.

21:49.006 --> 21:50.608
Barry Manilow?

21:52.743 --> 21:56.479
I will be using texts from the
ancient Assyrian Necronomicon

21:56.480 --> 22:00.751
as phonetically translated by the
professor Heinrich Hilmeister.

22:15.700 --> 22:19.436
"Mi-halo shaitan

22:19.437 --> 22:22.639
"ben-el shaitan

22:22.640 --> 22:26.376
shakraf hu y'ra."

22:26.377 --> 22:31.181
"Mi-halo shaitan

22:31.182 --> 22:33.850
"ben-el shaitan

22:33.851 --> 22:38.121
shakraf hu y'ra."

22:38.122 --> 22:41.324
"Mi-halo shaitan

22:41.325 --> 22:43.994
"ben-el shaitan

22:43.995 --> 22:47.197
shakraf hu y'ra."

22:47.198 --> 22:50.934
"Mi-halo shaitan..."

22:50.935 --> 22:52.003
Who's there?

23:01.612 --> 23:02.679
Perry!

23:02.680 --> 23:04.814
Oh, thank God. Father Bob.

23:04.815 --> 23:06.416
What are you doing in here

23:06.417 --> 23:08.551
and why do you have
on my chasuble?

23:08.552 --> 23:10.153
Don't be mad, Father.

23:10.154 --> 23:12.288
I needed a safe place to
conduct my experiment.

23:12.289 --> 23:13.890
Experiment?

23:13.891 --> 23:15.492
Yeah, and it worked.

23:15.493 --> 23:17.093
It worked better than
I could've dreamed.

23:17.094 --> 23:18.695
I actually conjured a demon.

23:18.696 --> 23:21.364
Conjured up a demon?
Oh, Perry.

23:21.365 --> 23:24.567
Perry, I have given you
every chance I could,

23:24.568 --> 23:27.237
but this obsession of yours has
gotten totally out of hand.

23:27.238 --> 23:29.372
You're not listening
to me, Father.

23:29.373 --> 23:31.508
I saw Angela. She's a demon.

23:31.509 --> 23:33.109
The legend of Hull
House is true.

23:33.110 --> 23:34.711
Perry... Father...

23:34.712 --> 23:36.312
I saw her in the mirror.

23:36.313 --> 23:38.448
Look, she attacked me.

23:38.449 --> 23:39.516
I have scratches
all over my wrist.

23:39.517 --> 23:41.117
She almost pulled me into
the mirror with her.

23:41.118 --> 23:42.185
Silence.

23:42.186 --> 23:45.388
Now, Perry, you have
desecrated the sacristy.

23:45.389 --> 23:48.591
You have defiled
my holy vestments.

23:48.592 --> 23:49.659
Not to mention the
damage you've done--

23:49.660 --> 23:51.261
Father, haven't you
heard a word I said?

23:51.262 --> 23:53.396
Yes, and I've heard
quite enough.

23:53.397 --> 23:55.532
Now, go to the dormitory.

23:55.533 --> 23:58.735
You're hereby grounded
until I decide otherwise.

23:58.736 --> 23:59.270
No dance tonight.

23:59.271 --> 24:00.336
Oh, come on, Father...

24:00.337 --> 24:01.938
Go.

24:01.939 --> 24:03.540
I'll take this.

24:03.541 --> 24:07.277
I'll expect the rest of your
collection in my office tomorrow.

24:07.278 --> 24:09.413
Drop it off before
your first class.

24:31.302 --> 24:32.902
Whoa! Back off, Romeo.

24:32.903 --> 24:35.038
Let's save some for later.

24:35.039 --> 24:36.639
Later?

24:36.640 --> 24:39.309
Now, listen, Shirley,
about this party.

24:39.310 --> 24:41.444
You know, I really don't
think it's a good idea.

24:41.445 --> 24:43.046
I mean, if we get
caught off campus,

24:43.047 --> 24:45.181
Old Glory's really gonna
rip our head off.

24:45.182 --> 24:47.317
Listen up, Inchworm,

24:47.318 --> 24:49.986
this is gonna be the
party of the century.

24:49.987 --> 24:52.655
Don't get me wrong. I don't
have a problem with it.

24:52.656 --> 24:54.791
You see, it's Johnny.

24:54.792 --> 24:56.392
Oh, yeah?

24:56.393 --> 24:59.596
Well, if you can't even get
your best friend to a party...

24:59.597 --> 25:02.799
Jesus, I can't believe
I actually let you

25:02.800 --> 25:04.400
touch my breasts.

25:04.401 --> 25:07.071
I didn't say that
I couldn't get him to come.

25:08.672 --> 25:10.273
Here's your invite.

25:10.274 --> 25:11.875
All the cute girls
will be there,

25:11.876 --> 25:12.942
including Bibi and Terri.

25:12.943 --> 25:16.679
If you ain't at the
pick-up by 8 with Johnny,

25:16.680 --> 25:18.816
forget you ever knew me.

25:22.019 --> 25:24.687
♪ Can you rise above? ♪

25:24.688 --> 25:29.493
♪ Plant a little seed
and watch it grow... ♪

25:32.163 --> 25:35.365
Oh, God, what was I thinking
when I bought this?

25:35.366 --> 25:38.568
Bibi, you're not helping.

25:38.569 --> 25:41.771
Who cares?

25:41.772 --> 25:43.373
My world is over.

25:43.374 --> 25:46.042
Well, mine isn't.

25:46.043 --> 25:47.644
Bibi, hey.

25:47.645 --> 25:51.915
I thought maybe you would want to
wear this to the dance tonight?

25:51.916 --> 25:53.516
What are you talking
about, Mouse?

25:53.517 --> 25:55.118
You trying to be funny?

25:55.119 --> 25:57.253
No, I...

25:57.254 --> 25:58.321
I'm not going to the dance.

25:58.322 --> 25:59.923
You're not?

25:59.924 --> 26:00.990
No, she's not.

26:00.991 --> 26:03.126
You're good friend Sister
Gory grounded her.

26:03.127 --> 26:04.727
Oh.

26:04.728 --> 26:06.863
I'm sorry.

26:06.864 --> 26:08.998
No. Hey, I appreciate it.

26:08.999 --> 26:11.134
It's really pretty.

26:11.135 --> 26:12.735
You think so?

26:12.736 --> 26:17.540
Um, I made it in
sewing class and...

26:17.541 --> 26:21.811
I don't know, but I could never
wear anything like this.

26:21.812 --> 26:22.879
Sure you could.

26:22.880 --> 26:23.947
No.

26:23.948 --> 26:25.548
Sure you could, Mouse.

26:25.549 --> 26:28.752
After all, it is Halloween.

26:33.023 --> 26:35.159
Here, I want you to have that.

26:36.760 --> 26:39.429
All right, look, B., this
is what we're going to do.

26:39.430 --> 26:41.564
All you need to do is go to Father Bob
and explain to him what happened.

26:41.565 --> 26:43.166
He's gonna have to let
us go to the dance.

26:43.167 --> 26:44.767
Fat chance.

26:44.768 --> 26:45.835
I just saw Father Bob
in the courtyard

26:45.836 --> 26:47.971
and he looked like he was
ready to kill somebody.

26:47.972 --> 26:51.708
Forget it. Come on, get up.

26:51.709 --> 26:54.377
Better start getting dressed
if you want to look your best.

26:54.378 --> 26:55.979
Ooh, for what?

26:55.980 --> 26:58.114
A leisurely night in the dorm?

26:58.115 --> 26:59.716
No, you dipshit, we're
going to a party,

26:59.717 --> 27:02.919
and I ain't talking Sister
Gloria's stupid dance, either.

27:02.920 --> 27:05.054
We're talking a real
Halloween party.

27:05.055 --> 27:07.724
We're talking the sexiest guys

27:07.725 --> 27:09.859
and the wildest
party games ever.

27:09.860 --> 27:10.927
Yeah, right.

27:10.928 --> 27:11.995
And I suppose that
you're gonna--

27:11.996 --> 27:13.596
Zip it, lame-o.

27:13.597 --> 27:16.799
Now, don't ask me how,

27:16.800 --> 27:18.401
but I pulled some strings,

27:18.402 --> 27:21.604
and I managed to get you
both on the A-list,

27:21.605 --> 27:23.206
so don't wuss out.

27:23.207 --> 27:24.807
And where's this party?

27:24.808 --> 27:26.943
Outside the walls of
this penitentiary,

27:26.944 --> 27:29.612
and that's all you gotta know

27:29.613 --> 27:32.282
except for the fact that
Johnny will be there.

27:32.283 --> 27:34.417
Oh...

27:34.418 --> 27:35.485
Johnny?

27:35.486 --> 27:37.086
Yeah.

27:37.087 --> 27:40.823
Oh, could you get
Mouse to come?

27:40.824 --> 27:42.960
Mouse?

27:45.629 --> 27:47.230
Why do you want Mouse?

27:47.231 --> 27:48.298
Why not?

27:48.299 --> 27:50.968
Didn't Sister Gloria say
we should be nice to her?

27:53.103 --> 27:55.772
I don't know, Kurt. She
didn't even say where it is.

27:55.773 --> 27:57.907
Who cares where it is?
It's a party, man.

27:57.908 --> 28:01.110
And wherever it is,
Bibi's gonna be there.

28:01.111 --> 28:02.713
Bibi?

28:09.119 --> 28:14.457
And anybody who's anybody
is gonna be there.

28:14.458 --> 28:16.592
Twist my arm.

28:16.593 --> 28:19.262
You think I'd have to?

28:19.263 --> 28:23.533
♪ When I touch,
it makes me shiver ♪

28:23.534 --> 28:27.271
♪ When I feel,
it makes me shiver ♪

28:29.940 --> 28:31.007
Hey, I don't know if we should

28:31.008 --> 28:32.608
be doing this, you guys.

28:32.609 --> 28:33.676
You're right, Mouse.

28:33.677 --> 28:35.278
Why don't you just
go back to the dorm?

28:35.279 --> 28:36.346
Terri, please.

28:36.347 --> 28:38.481
Mouse, just relax.

28:38.482 --> 28:39.549
It's a party.

28:39.550 --> 28:41.150
Just stop worrying
for one night, okay?

28:41.151 --> 28:42.752
It's gonna be fine.

28:42.753 --> 28:44.887
Um, is it a costume party?

28:44.888 --> 28:47.023
No, Shirley told us
to come as we were.

28:47.024 --> 28:49.158
Hey, if Sister Gloria finds
out we're doing this,

28:49.159 --> 28:50.226
we're gonna get in trouble--

28:50.227 --> 28:51.294
Gloria's not gonna find out.

28:51.295 --> 28:52.895
We'll be back before
the dance is over.

28:52.896 --> 28:54.498
Shh. Car's coming.

29:06.243 --> 29:09.445
Let's go, gang. We ain't
waiting here all night.

29:09.446 --> 29:11.581
Everybody, this is Rick.

29:11.582 --> 29:12.648
Hey.

29:12.649 --> 29:14.251
Come here, sweet tits.

29:23.861 --> 29:24.928
Kurt.

29:25.996 --> 29:28.131
Say hi to Rick.

29:28.132 --> 29:29.198
Hey.

29:29.199 --> 29:31.334
Let's move it, huh?

29:31.335 --> 29:33.469
Jeez, I don't want to be doing
time here for hauling jail bait.

29:33.470 --> 29:34.537
Let's go.

29:34.538 --> 29:36.139
Glad you made it, Mouse.

29:36.140 --> 29:38.275
My name's Melissa.

30:17.247 --> 30:18.848
So, uh, Rick?

30:18.849 --> 30:19.916
Huh?

30:19.917 --> 30:22.051
What school do you go to?

30:22.052 --> 30:24.720
I'm currently enrolled at the
school of hard knockers.

30:24.721 --> 30:28.458
Yeah, but, you know, I'm pretty
much into the entire student body,

30:28.459 --> 30:30.593
huh, Shirl?

30:30.594 --> 30:31.915
So you kids are all
troubled, huh?

30:34.331 --> 30:36.466
How 'bout, you, Marcia?
What's your problem?

30:36.467 --> 30:39.669
Actually, I, um...

30:39.670 --> 30:41.270
I killed my parents.

30:41.271 --> 30:42.872
Oh, yeah? Me, too.

30:42.873 --> 30:43.941
All right.

31:04.761 --> 31:05.828
Hey, wait a minute!
Wait a minute.

31:05.829 --> 31:07.430
I'm a little lost here.

31:07.431 --> 31:08.498
Which way do we go?

31:08.499 --> 31:09.566
Right. Go left.

31:11.168 --> 31:12.768
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

31:12.769 --> 31:13.837
Wussies.

31:56.013 --> 31:58.147
Oh, God, no.

31:58.148 --> 32:00.816
No, this is Hull House.

32:00.817 --> 32:02.418
Mouse, I'm sorry.

32:02.419 --> 32:03.486
Bibi, you tricked me.

32:03.487 --> 32:05.087
No, Shirley didn't tell me.

32:05.088 --> 32:08.291
Sorry, babe. The
Ritz was booked.

32:08.292 --> 32:11.494
No. No, take me home.

32:11.495 --> 32:12.562
I can't go here!

32:12.563 --> 32:13.629
Would somebody shut her up?

32:13.630 --> 32:15.765
Take me home! I can't go!

32:15.766 --> 32:17.366
Shut the fuck up! Shut up!

32:17.367 --> 32:19.502
Shut up, Mouse.

32:19.503 --> 32:20.570
No!

32:20.571 --> 32:22.171
Maybe we should discuss this.

32:22.172 --> 32:23.239
Yes.

32:23.240 --> 32:24.307
Nobody knew that it was here.

32:24.308 --> 32:26.443
Overruled.

32:40.857 --> 32:42.992
You didn't tell us the
party was at Hull House.

32:42.993 --> 32:45.662
I didn't say it wasn't, did I?

32:48.332 --> 32:49.398
Johnny?

32:49.399 --> 32:51.534
Well, we're here already.

32:51.535 --> 32:52.602
We may as well make
the most of it.

32:52.603 --> 32:54.738
You know, something to
tell our grandkids about.

32:59.009 --> 33:00.076
Here, Shirl.

33:00.077 --> 33:01.143
Come on, Mouse.

33:01.144 --> 33:02.745
You brought me here, Bibi.

33:02.746 --> 33:03.813
Well, I didn't know.

33:03.814 --> 33:05.948
Hey, come on, Mouse,
don't be afraid.

33:05.949 --> 33:08.618
You're with us. Nothing's
gonna happen here tonight.

33:08.619 --> 33:10.753
You know about my
sister, Angela.

33:10.754 --> 33:14.490
Melissa, nobody knows for sure
what happened to your sister.

33:14.491 --> 33:16.626
I mean, maybe she
just ran away.

33:16.627 --> 33:19.295
Hey, look, if she wants
to stay here, fine.

33:19.296 --> 33:21.431
Let her. Come on.

33:22.499 --> 33:24.634
Wait a second. He did what?

33:24.635 --> 33:27.304
You should have seen his face.

33:48.125 --> 33:50.793
Oh, Angela!

33:50.794 --> 33:53.462
Angela!

33:53.463 --> 33:55.598
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

33:55.599 --> 33:57.733
Your party guests are here!

33:57.734 --> 33:58.801
Shh! Come on!

33:58.802 --> 34:00.403
This place used to
be a funeral home.

34:00.404 --> 34:04.141
So what? Are you afraid
I'll wake the dead?

34:11.614 --> 34:13.216
This is awesome.

34:34.571 --> 34:37.239
♪ Close my eyes
and I'm lost ♪

34:37.239 --> 34:40.976
♪ In a world
that's moving... ♪

34:44.181 --> 34:46.850
Leave a little room
for the Holy Ghost.

34:51.655 --> 34:52.723
Oh, God.

34:56.460 --> 34:58.060
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

34:58.061 --> 34:59.129
Blessed are...

35:09.806 --> 35:11.407
Real cute.

35:11.408 --> 35:13.009
I don't think
Angela will mind.

35:15.145 --> 35:17.280
There. Done.

35:45.041 --> 35:46.642
What was that?

35:46.643 --> 35:48.244
Probably just Rick.

35:48.245 --> 35:50.379
He's a real scream, isn't he?

35:50.380 --> 35:52.515
I'm starving. What
is there to eat?

35:52.516 --> 35:55.184
Well...

35:55.185 --> 35:57.853
Bibi's wearing candy pants.

35:57.854 --> 35:58.388
Oh, yeah?

35:58.389 --> 35:59.989
What flavor?

35:59.990 --> 36:02.659
Um, cherry?

36:03.727 --> 36:05.861
Mmm. Johnny's favorite.

36:05.862 --> 36:07.997
Oh, come on, guys.

36:07.998 --> 36:09.598
Do you want to take a walk?

36:09.599 --> 36:11.734
You're not afraid
of Hull House?

36:11.735 --> 36:13.335
You'll protect me, won't you?

36:13.336 --> 36:14.403
Oh, yeah.

36:14.404 --> 36:16.539
Hey, wait a second, you guys.

36:16.540 --> 36:18.674
You're not gonna leave
me here alone, are you?

36:18.675 --> 36:20.277
You're not alone.

36:24.014 --> 36:25.614
Hey, don't go too far.

36:25.615 --> 36:27.750
I have a big
surprise coming up.

36:27.751 --> 36:29.352
Oh, I can't wait.

36:47.504 --> 36:48.571
Hey, Shirl,

36:48.572 --> 36:50.172
check this out, huh?

36:50.173 --> 36:52.308
Found it in the old morgue.

36:52.309 --> 36:53.909
Hmm? Whoa.

36:53.910 --> 36:57.112
Think of all the dead bodies
that slept on this thing.

36:57.113 --> 36:58.180
Oh, yeah.

36:58.181 --> 36:59.248
Rick, check it out. Huh?

36:59.249 --> 37:01.383
Shit.

37:01.384 --> 37:02.986
What the hell?

37:04.588 --> 37:07.256
Jesus, Rick, this paint sucks.

37:07.257 --> 37:09.925
What do you want from me?
I stole the best I could.

37:09.926 --> 37:12.061
This party sucks.

37:12.062 --> 37:14.730
Why don't you go take
a little field trip?

37:14.731 --> 37:16.332
Go do some sight seeing.

37:16.333 --> 37:17.399
Hey, get out of here, man.

37:17.400 --> 37:19.001
Rick and I will call
when we need ya.

37:19.002 --> 37:20.604
Sure.

37:30.747 --> 37:32.348
So, did you bring the
little fuzz ball?

37:32.349 --> 37:33.950
Mm-hmm.

37:35.018 --> 37:36.619
Oh, how cute.

37:36.620 --> 37:39.288
Yeah, the perfect
little victim.

37:39.289 --> 37:40.890
For pin the knife
on the sacrifice.

37:40.891 --> 37:43.026
Kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty.

37:48.899 --> 37:51.034
What a dump.

38:11.321 --> 38:12.389
Come on, Bibi.

38:17.193 --> 38:18.274
Are you all right in there?

38:23.066 --> 38:26.802
Serious, you had me worried.

38:26.803 --> 38:29.471
Ooh, it's cold out here.

38:29.472 --> 38:35.345
Yeah, well, I know a place
where we can warm up.

38:36.413 --> 38:38.547
You gotta keep
your eyes closed.

38:38.548 --> 38:39.616
Okay. All right?

38:43.353 --> 38:45.487
Okay.

38:45.488 --> 38:47.623
Cool, huh?

38:47.624 --> 38:48.691
Mm-hmm.

38:48.692 --> 38:50.292
Ow!

38:50.293 --> 38:52.428
Wanna party?

38:52.429 --> 38:55.098
Absolutely.

38:59.369 --> 39:02.571
Hey, stop it!

39:02.572 --> 39:03.639
Shh.

39:03.640 --> 39:06.309
What?

39:12.716 --> 39:14.317
Come on, stop.

39:15.385 --> 39:17.520
Not here in the hallway.

39:47.951 --> 39:50.086
You're so beautiful.

40:36.533 --> 40:38.133
Somebody help me!

40:38.134 --> 40:40.269
Woo hoo hoo!

40:40.270 --> 40:41.871
Mouse?

40:46.676 --> 40:47.743
Z-boy!

40:47.744 --> 40:48.811
What's up, man? Hey, baby.

40:48.812 --> 40:49.878
Happy Halloween, dude. Yeah!

40:49.879 --> 40:53.615
Yeah, now. Hey, dollface.

40:53.616 --> 40:55.751
Scared up another
party guest for ya.

40:55.752 --> 40:56.819
Boo!

40:56.820 --> 40:59.488
Well, you also scared
away our sacrifice, dude.

40:59.489 --> 41:00.556
Ooh.

41:00.557 --> 41:01.623
Hey, Shirl, you know what?

41:01.624 --> 41:03.225
Who needs a cat...

41:03.226 --> 41:04.827
when we got a little mouse?

41:04.828 --> 41:06.962
Ooh, yeah, mama.

41:06.963 --> 41:10.165
Yeah, who needs a cat?

41:10.166 --> 41:12.835
Maybe we can find a virgin.

41:12.836 --> 41:13.902
Mousy little mousy.

41:13.903 --> 41:14.971
Mousy! Mousy!

41:19.242 --> 41:20.309
Hey, what was that?

41:20.310 --> 41:22.444
Olly olly oxen free!

41:22.445 --> 41:24.046
It's time for the
big surprise!

41:24.047 --> 41:27.249
Hey, come on. We don't want
to miss the big surprise.

41:27.250 --> 41:28.852
Come on.

41:44.868 --> 41:46.469
This is so romantic.

41:51.274 --> 41:53.942
Oh, shit!

41:53.943 --> 41:55.010
What the hell's going on?

41:55.011 --> 41:57.679
Ah-ah-ah! Hold it
right there, hulk.

41:57.680 --> 41:59.281
I don't think you want
to be doing that.

41:59.282 --> 42:01.416
No, no, no, you just
shut the fuck up

42:01.417 --> 42:03.552
and enjoy the show now, 'kay?

42:03.553 --> 42:04.621
Wohaa!

42:27.577 --> 42:29.711
Tonight, we gather in
the name of darkness,

42:29.712 --> 42:32.915
and with this
consecrated dagger,

42:32.916 --> 42:36.118
we offer this virgin lamb.

42:36.119 --> 42:37.187
That's Perry's book.

42:42.525 --> 42:47.329
Please accept her blood as
payment for the favors we seek.

42:47.330 --> 42:50.532
Accept the purity
of her life force.

42:50.533 --> 42:53.736
Feast on her virgin soul.

43:18.294 --> 43:20.964
Please, accept our
humble sacrifice.

43:23.633 --> 43:24.701
Amen.

43:34.844 --> 43:36.445
No!

43:36.446 --> 43:38.580
What do you think
you're doing, man?

43:38.581 --> 43:41.250
Stop it! Stop!

43:41.251 --> 43:42.317
Stop it!

43:42.318 --> 43:44.454
Listen--

43:47.123 --> 43:48.190
Johnny, stop.

43:48.191 --> 43:49.258
Stop?

43:49.259 --> 43:50.325
I'm just getting started.

43:50.326 --> 43:51.927
No, didn't you
hear that scream?

43:51.928 --> 43:53.528
No.

43:53.529 --> 43:56.198
It was probably just
some stupid prank.

43:56.199 --> 43:58.334
No, I don't think so.

44:04.741 --> 44:06.341
Look here, Hulkster.
No pain, no brain.

44:06.342 --> 44:07.943
No cavity.

44:07.944 --> 44:10.078
It don't slice, dice,
chop, or peel, my man.

44:10.079 --> 44:12.214
It's the all new
amazing Knife-O-Matic.

44:12.215 --> 44:13.282
We like that, baby.

44:13.283 --> 44:15.951
What's going on?

44:15.952 --> 44:18.086
Dude, why didn't you guys
tell me it was a fake knife?

44:18.087 --> 44:20.222
Jesus, what are you?
The joke inspector?

44:20.223 --> 44:21.823
You ruined the prank, asswipe.

44:21.824 --> 44:22.891
Oh, mama.

44:22.892 --> 44:25.560
Look, we got us a little
miss prom queen here.

44:25.561 --> 44:27.162
Yeah, back off, pal.

44:27.163 --> 44:28.764
Oh, a tough guy, huh?

44:28.765 --> 44:32.501
Tell me something, toughie,
is she as good as she looks?

44:32.502 --> 44:34.103
You'll never know.

44:35.171 --> 44:36.772
You're breaking my heart.
You're breaking it in two.

44:36.773 --> 44:38.907
Just let me have a
little something, boy.

44:38.908 --> 44:40.509
Woo!

44:40.510 --> 44:41.576
What the hell is that?

44:41.577 --> 44:43.178
Something's happening.

44:43.179 --> 44:44.246
Yeah, I can feel it.

44:44.247 --> 44:46.915
Really, I can smell it.
It's gross.

44:46.916 --> 44:49.051
Smells like a little
teen spirit to me.

44:49.052 --> 44:50.118
Teen spirit, my ass.

44:50.119 --> 44:51.721
It smells like
Godzilla's butthole.

45:01.864 --> 45:03.999
It was Angela! It was Angela!

45:04.000 --> 45:06.668
She was standing right there.
I saw her!

45:06.669 --> 45:08.804
Bibi, take me out of here.
Please!

45:08.805 --> 45:10.939
Okay, honey. Come on.

45:10.940 --> 45:12.541
Please! Please.

45:12.542 --> 45:13.608
No, she was here!

45:13.609 --> 45:15.210
She was standing-- I saw
her standing right here!

45:15.211 --> 45:16.813
Melissa, there's nobody here.
She's here!

45:18.948 --> 45:20.015
Holy shit, that is rank!

45:20.016 --> 45:21.083
Hey, I don't know
about you guys,

45:21.084 --> 45:22.684
but I say we get the
hell out of here now.

45:22.685 --> 45:24.286
This place bites the big one.

45:24.287 --> 45:26.421
Yeah, wait a second, you
guys, I've gotta go pee.

45:26.422 --> 45:28.023
Terri, you can hold it.

45:28.024 --> 45:29.091
No, I don't think so.

45:29.092 --> 45:30.692
Not if she's riding in my car.

45:30.693 --> 45:32.294
Well, come on. Just
hurry up, will ya?

45:32.295 --> 45:33.895
Look, I'll go with her.

45:33.896 --> 45:35.498
It's right there.

45:38.701 --> 45:40.837
Well, I think I gotta
go pee, too.

45:50.446 --> 45:51.513
There it is.

45:51.514 --> 45:53.649
Make it fast, would you?
Don't worry.

46:04.327 --> 46:06.461
What do you want?

46:06.462 --> 46:07.530
Go on now! Get.

46:19.809 --> 46:20.809
What?

46:24.080 --> 46:25.680
Come on, let's
get out of here.

46:25.681 --> 46:27.283
Girls.

46:28.885 --> 46:29.952
Kids.

46:46.502 --> 46:48.103
Damn.

46:48.104 --> 46:50.238
Wait up for me, baby. Hey.

46:50.239 --> 46:52.375
I'm ready for you.
Where you been? Hey!

46:54.510 --> 46:55.577
Let's get the
hell out of here.

46:55.578 --> 46:56.645
Terri, what's wrong?

46:56.646 --> 46:58.246
Can we just go now, please?

46:58.247 --> 47:00.382
Hey, we ain't going
nowhere without Z-boy.

47:00.383 --> 47:01.983
Well, where the hell is he?

47:01.984 --> 47:03.585
He went to take a leak. Did
you pass him in the hall?

47:03.586 --> 47:05.188
No.

47:09.992 --> 47:14.796
Okay, honey child,
I know you're up there.

47:14.797 --> 47:17.466
Don't be playing no games
with old Z-boy, baby.

47:17.467 --> 47:19.067
You can't get away from me.

47:19.068 --> 47:20.670
Oooh.

47:37.753 --> 47:39.354
Oh, no. Dear God, no.

47:39.355 --> 47:40.956
No, no, no, no!

47:40.957 --> 47:42.558
What are you doing? No!

48:02.311 --> 48:03.912
Jeez, doesn't the fun
ever end in this place?

48:03.913 --> 48:08.183
Z-boy. That dude always has
to have the last laugh.

48:08.184 --> 48:09.784
Well, let's just see
how hard he's laughing

48:09.785 --> 48:11.386
when he comes back here,
finds us all gone.

48:11.387 --> 48:13.522
We can't just leave him here.

48:13.523 --> 48:15.123
Hell we can't.

48:15.124 --> 48:16.191
He got here on his
own, didn't he?

48:16.192 --> 48:18.327
Well, he can get his ass home.
I'm leaving.

48:22.064 --> 48:24.733
Z-boy!

48:24.734 --> 48:27.937
Z-boy!

48:29.539 --> 48:33.809
Hey, Z-boy, we're
splitting, baby.

48:35.411 --> 48:38.614
Fuck him.

48:43.419 --> 48:45.021
Oh, yeah.

48:51.961 --> 48:54.095
Damn it, Shirl,
would you move it?

48:54.096 --> 48:56.765
Man, I have seen
enough of this place.

48:56.766 --> 48:58.366
Come on!

48:58.367 --> 49:01.036
Jesus, Rick, can't you wait more
than a minute for anything?

49:01.037 --> 49:03.172
Yeah, that's funny, Shirl.

49:29.332 --> 49:30.398
Thank goodness we're
out of there.

49:30.399 --> 49:32.000
I know what you mean.

49:32.001 --> 49:34.669
Relax guys. Come on, we just
passed the underground stream.

49:34.670 --> 49:36.271
What?

49:36.272 --> 49:38.940
The underground stream that
surrounds the property.

49:38.941 --> 49:41.076
Everybody says it keeps
the demons inside.

49:41.077 --> 49:42.678
Yeah, right.

50:00.296 --> 50:04.032
Certainly, Perry. You know, I'm
always here for you children,

50:04.033 --> 50:06.701
though Father Bob might
choose to believe otherwise.

50:06.702 --> 50:09.371
I don't want to get anybody
in trouble, but I think--

50:09.372 --> 50:10.972
Trouble? Don't be silly.

You're not going to get
anyone in trouble. Speak up.

out to Hull House tonight.

50:17.380 --> 50:18.980
Look.

50:18.981 --> 50:20.582
You see that road?

50:20.583 --> 50:22.717
That goes to Old Hull Road.

50:22.718 --> 50:25.387
Somebody took one of
my books, Sister.

50:25.388 --> 50:27.522
A book on demonology.

50:27.523 --> 50:28.591
Look at this.

50:31.794 --> 50:34.462
I think they went to Hull House
to perform some kind of ceremony.

50:34.463 --> 50:36.598
Who went out there, Perry?

50:36.599 --> 50:39.802
Kurt and Johnny and a

52:29.779 --> 52:32.981
I had no idea what
Shirley had planned.

52:32.982 --> 52:35.116
Honest.

52:35.117 --> 52:37.253
Hey, it's not your fault.

52:39.922 --> 52:42.056
I just hope she'll
be all right.

52:44.727 --> 52:47.929
Sure, I'll come up for
a little sticky treat.

52:47.930 --> 52:48.997
Thank you, Sheriff.

52:48.998 --> 52:51.132
I'm sure it's just
a false alarm.

52:51.133 --> 52:55.938
One of our boys has a very
overworked imagination.

52:58.073 --> 52:59.141
Thank you.

53:00.743 --> 53:03.945
All right, the sheriff is sending
out one of his deputies.

53:03.946 --> 53:06.614
If our kids are out there,
I'm sure they'll find them.

53:06.615 --> 53:08.216
It could be too late
by then, Father.

53:08.217 --> 53:11.953
Oh, Perry, I've had enough of
your Halloween shenanigans.

53:11.954 --> 53:14.088
Now, you've desecrated
the sacristy,

53:14.089 --> 53:15.690
and now, you must admit,

53:15.691 --> 53:18.359
that if any of our kids
did go out to Hull House,

53:18.360 --> 53:21.029
it was one of your ridiculous
books that gave them the idea.

53:21.030 --> 53:23.164
Perhaps we should listen
to the boy, Father.

53:23.165 --> 53:26.367
We should certainly be
thankful for his vigilance.

53:26.368 --> 53:29.037
Well, Sister, there
is a fine line

53:29.038 --> 53:31.707
between vigilance and
paranoia, isn't there?

53:32.775 --> 53:37.579
Now, if you'll both excuse me,

53:37.580 --> 53:39.714
I've had a rather long day.

53:39.715 --> 53:41.316
I'm going to bed.

53:41.317 --> 53:43.985

Hey, Mouse. Mouse, wait.

53:54.129 --> 53:55.196
She'll be all right.

53:55.197 --> 53:56.798

Yeah, well, let's get a dance
in before she recovers.

54:11.747 --> 54:13.882

much into dancing.

54:13.883 --> 54:16.017

01:01:19.374 --> 01:01:20.975
I don't believe this.

01:01:20.976 --> 01:01:23.110
Why is it happening here?

01:01:23.111 --> 01:01:24.178
Oh, God, the lipstick.

01:01:24.179 --> 01:01:25.246
What lipstick?

01:01:25.247 --> 01:01:26.847
The lipstick that I brought
from Hull House.

01:01:26.848 --> 01:01:28.449
You mean you brought
something out of Hull House?

01:01:28.450 --> 01:01:29.517
Be quiet, Perry.

01:01:29.518 --> 01:01:31.652
But, Sister, don't
you understand?

01:01:31.653 --> 01:01:33.254
That lipstick must
be the conveyance

01:01:33.255 --> 01:01:34.855
that brought the demons out

01:01:34.856 --> 01:01:36.457
across the underground streams.

01:01:36.458 --> 01:01:38.059
We'll deal with that later.

01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:40.728
Johnny, go find Father Bob.

01:01:40.729 --> 01:01:43.397
He's got to get over here and
give that boy his last rites.

01:01:43.398 --> 01:01:44.999
Satan has taken his body.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.736
Maybe we can save his soul.

01:01:48.737 --> 01:01:52.473
Bibi, you get over to the chapel and
make sure everyone stays inside.

01:01:52.474 --> 01:01:53.541
Okay.

01:01:53.542 --> 01:01:55.676
Perry, you get over
to the chapel.

01:01:55.677 --> 01:01:57.278
Where are you going?

01:01:57.279 --> 01:01:58.880
To prepare.

01:02:29.311 --> 01:02:30.911
Don't panic, okay?
One at a time!

01:02:30.912 --> 01:02:31.979
One at a time.

01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:34.649
Terri! Terri!

01:02:40.522 --> 01:02:42.123
Bibi! Bibi, are you okay?

01:02:42.124 --> 01:02:44.258
Johnny!

01:02:44.259 --> 01:02:45.326
I can't find Terri.

01:02:45.327 --> 01:02:46.394
They're probably inside.

01:02:46.395 --> 01:02:47.996
Just go inside.
I'll be right back.

01:03:07.215 --> 01:03:08.816
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

01:03:08.817 --> 01:03:11.485
Come on, you know you
want it as much as I do.

01:03:11.486 --> 01:03:13.087
Kurt, we're just
getting acquainted.

01:03:13.088 --> 01:03:16.291
Oh, yeah, but I'd like to
get way more acquainted.

01:03:17.359 --> 01:03:18.959
Okay.

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:21.629
This is as far as I go.

01:03:21.630 --> 01:03:23.765
Well, if I have to.

01:03:36.044 --> 01:03:37.646
Oh, yeah.

01:03:47.789 --> 01:03:49.924
That feels good.

01:03:49.925 --> 01:03:50.991
Mm-hmm.

01:03:50.992 --> 01:03:52.594
Oh...

01:03:56.331 --> 01:03:57.398
Well, slow down, now.

01:03:57.399 --> 01:03:59.533
You don't want to
strike oil too soon.

01:03:59.534 --> 01:04:02.204
Hey, hey. Calm down, will you?

01:04:07.542 --> 01:04:08.610
Oh, shit!

01:04:17.686 --> 01:04:20.888
What a healthy,
strapping young buck.

01:04:20.889 --> 01:04:22.491
How's about a
little head, tiger?

01:04:42.777 --> 01:04:43.844
Oh, my God.

01:04:43.845 --> 01:04:45.980
Oh, my God. Shirley.

01:04:45.981 --> 01:04:48.115
The most horrible
thing has happened.

01:04:48.116 --> 01:04:49.717
It was Kurt! It was--

01:04:49.718 --> 01:04:52.386
It's not so horrible.

01:04:52.387 --> 01:04:53.988
Oh, my God!

01:04:53.989 --> 01:04:55.056
What?

01:04:56.124 --> 01:04:57.726
Shirley, what are you--

01:05:11.606 --> 01:05:12.673
Father Bob, wake up!

01:05:12.674 --> 01:05:14.808
Wake up, Father!

01:05:14.809 --> 01:05:16.410
What?

01:05:16.411 --> 01:05:17.478
What is it?

01:05:17.479 --> 01:05:18.547
It's an emergency! Hurry!

01:05:21.216 --> 01:05:22.816
All right, well, give
me a couple of minutes.

01:05:22.817 --> 01:05:26.020
Please, Sister
Gloria needs you!

01:05:26.021 --> 01:05:28.690
All right.

01:05:31.893 --> 01:05:34.028
Don't cry, little one!

01:05:34.029 --> 01:05:37.231
I'm back, and I'm gonna
take good care of you now.

01:05:37.232 --> 01:05:38.832
Angela?

01:05:38.833 --> 01:05:43.103
No, you can't be here.

01:05:43.104 --> 01:05:44.705
You died.

01:05:44.706 --> 01:05:45.773
No, I didn't.

01:05:45.774 --> 01:05:47.908
I'm dreaming.

01:05:47.909 --> 01:05:49.510
I'm just dreaming again.

01:05:49.511 --> 01:05:51.111
No, you're not.

01:05:51.112 --> 01:05:52.713
It is me, Mouse.

01:05:52.714 --> 01:05:56.450
I'm flesh and blood
just like you, see?

01:05:56.451 --> 01:05:58.053
I'm your flesh and blood.

01:06:00.188 --> 01:06:02.323
Listen, Mouse, I was so scared

01:06:02.324 --> 01:06:04.992
after what happened at
my Halloween party.

01:06:04.993 --> 01:06:06.594
I had to run away.

01:06:06.595 --> 01:06:09.797
I just couldn't
face Mom and Dad.

01:06:09.798 --> 01:06:12.466
I knew you were miserable
when they passed on.

01:06:12.467 --> 01:06:15.135
You must have been so lonely.

01:06:15.136 --> 01:06:18.872
Oh, Angela, it was so,
so lonely without you.

01:06:18.873 --> 01:06:19.940
Oh, it's okay now.

01:06:19.941 --> 01:06:23.143
My little Mouse.

01:06:23.144 --> 01:06:27.948
I've come to take you away
with me to a wonderful place

01:06:27.949 --> 01:06:30.084
where you'll never
be lonely again.

01:06:30.085 --> 01:06:32.753
I have lots of
great friends now.

01:06:32.754 --> 01:06:35.422
They were all lonely once,

01:06:35.423 --> 01:06:37.025
just like you.

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:41.296
You still love me,
don't you, Mouse?

01:06:44.499 --> 01:06:48.770
Oh, Ang, I missed you so much.

01:06:54.109 --> 01:06:56.243
All right, children,
stay calm.

01:06:56.244 --> 01:06:57.311
What's that?

01:06:57.312 --> 01:06:58.912
Holy artillery.

01:06:58.913 --> 01:06:59.980
Do you have one for me?

01:06:59.981 --> 01:07:02.116
Sister Gloria, I'd
like an explanation.

01:07:02.117 --> 01:07:03.717
Did you give him the
last rites, Father?

01:07:03.718 --> 01:07:04.785
Give the last rites
to whom, Sister?

01:07:04.786 --> 01:07:06.387
Rick's body was gone.

01:07:06.388 --> 01:07:07.454
Gone?

01:07:07.455 --> 01:07:10.124
Bibi! Where's Bibi?

01:07:10.125 --> 01:07:12.259
Sister Gloria, why are
you wearing that habit?

01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:13.861
I have an Uzi, Sister,

01:07:13.862 --> 01:07:15.996
holy water filled balloons--
What are you talking about?

01:07:15.997 --> 01:07:17.599
An Uzi? Six rosaries,
a cross...

01:07:34.683 --> 01:07:35.750
Mouse?

01:07:52.834 --> 01:07:56.037
Why do you want Mouse
when you can have me?

01:08:02.977 --> 01:08:04.579
Bibi!

01:08:12.587 --> 01:08:14.189
Hold her.

01:08:16.323 --> 01:08:17.926
Pour it down her throat.

01:08:45.153 --> 01:08:46.755
Touchè.

01:08:50.492 --> 01:08:51.558
Take her to the chapel.

01:08:51.559 --> 01:08:53.160
She's gonna be all right.

01:08:53.161 --> 01:08:54.763
Let's go.

01:08:57.432 --> 01:08:58.500
Melissa?

01:09:02.237 --> 01:09:03.304
Melissa?

01:09:05.974 --> 01:09:07.573
Sister Gloria!

01:09:07.575 --> 01:09:09.711
Come here, look!

01:09:15.582 --> 01:09:18.252
Things are gonna be so
good for us now, Mouse.

01:09:18.252 --> 01:09:20.388
Just you and me, the way it
always should have been.

01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:23.057
Time to go.

01:09:24.658 --> 01:09:26.261
Well, you coming or not?

01:09:35.336 --> 01:09:40.140
Sister Gloria, would you please tell
me what is happening around here?

01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:41.742
I can't find Kurt anywhere.

01:09:41.743 --> 01:09:44.411
The demons have escaped from Hull
House and they've kidnapped Mouse.

01:09:44.412 --> 01:09:45.479
Oh, Perry, don't start.

01:09:45.479 --> 01:09:47.080
Now, I warned you
once tonight--

01:09:47.081 --> 01:09:48.682
But he's right, Father.

01:09:48.683 --> 01:09:51.350
I have seen Satan's work
tonight with my own eyes.

01:09:51.352 --> 01:09:54.020
Look, I cannot believe
I am hearing this.

01:09:54.022 --> 01:09:55.622
Sister Gloria, come here.

01:09:55.623 --> 01:09:58.292
Now, I expect this
nonsense from the kids,

01:09:58.293 --> 01:10:00.427
but you are supposed
to be a role model.

01:10:00.428 --> 01:10:03.097
Father, look at the statue.

01:10:04.699 --> 01:10:06.301
Oh, no.

01:10:07.902 --> 01:10:09.503
Now do you believe me?

01:10:09.504 --> 01:10:11.104
What?

01:10:11.105 --> 01:10:14.308
Ugh. Perry, someone
vandalized the statue.

01:10:14.309 --> 01:10:16.443
There are none so
blind, Father, as--

01:10:16.444 --> 01:10:20.714
Oh, Perry, there are none so
annoyed as I am right now.

01:10:20.715 --> 01:10:22.316
First of all, I get
dragged out of my bed

01:10:22.317 --> 01:10:24.451
with a story about a boy
needing the last rites,

01:10:24.452 --> 01:10:26.053
and now this.

01:10:26.054 --> 01:10:27.654
Where do you think
you're going?

01:10:27.655 --> 01:10:29.256
To Hull House.

01:10:29.257 --> 01:10:31.391
Somebody's gotta save Mouse.

01:10:31.392 --> 01:10:32.459
Not you.

01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:33.527
Perry's right. I'm going, too.

01:10:33.528 --> 01:10:35.128
It's my fault she's there.

01:10:35.129 --> 01:10:37.798
You don't know what
we're dealing with.

01:10:37.799 --> 01:10:39.933
Oh, come on! We're
losing time.

01:10:39.934 --> 01:10:41.535
Father, give me the car keys.

01:10:41.536 --> 01:10:45.272
You are not setting foot
off these school grounds.

01:10:45.273 --> 01:10:47.941
Now wait a minute,
Sister Gloria.

01:10:47.942 --> 01:10:50.611
If they want to go, I think
we should let them.

01:10:50.612 --> 01:10:52.746
In fact, we'll all go.

01:10:52.747 --> 01:10:55.415
And by the time this
evening is over,

01:10:55.416 --> 01:10:57.017
the legend of Hull House

01:10:57.018 --> 01:10:58.619
will be laid to rest forever.

01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:00.221
Let's go.

01:11:21.042 --> 01:11:23.711
Well, let's go in.
Get it over with.

01:11:25.313 --> 01:11:27.981
And after we put an end
to this absurd prank,

01:11:27.982 --> 01:11:30.117
we'll deal with whoever
instigated it.

01:11:30.118 --> 01:11:32.786
Father, I thought the sheriff was
supposed to send somebody out here.

01:11:32.787 --> 01:11:34.922
Perry, I'm sure they've
come and gone.

01:11:34.923 --> 01:11:38.125
Come and gone? They probably didn't
get past the Donut King back in town.

01:11:38.126 --> 01:11:40.260
They couldn't help us.

01:11:40.261 --> 01:11:42.396
Not tonight.

01:11:42.397 --> 01:11:44.532
Not in this place.

01:12:03.217 --> 01:12:04.284
Melissa?

01:12:04.285 --> 01:12:06.420
Melissa, are you here?

01:12:06.421 --> 01:12:08.555
Shh! Perry, please.

01:12:08.556 --> 01:12:10.158
This way.

01:12:13.361 --> 01:12:14.962
Whoa, whoa, hold on a minute.

01:12:14.963 --> 01:12:18.165
I agreed to take you all out
here on this wild goose chase,

01:12:18.166 --> 01:12:21.902
but I will not spend all night traipsing
around some dusty old mansion.

01:12:21.903 --> 01:12:24.037
Now if Melissa's here,

01:12:24.038 --> 01:12:27.240
we will find her much more
quickly by splitting up.

01:12:27.241 --> 01:12:28.842
We must stick together.

01:12:28.843 --> 01:12:30.978
This house is a
portal to hell.

01:12:30.979 --> 01:12:32.045
Thanks, Sister.

01:12:32.046 --> 01:12:34.715
I really needed to know that.

01:12:34.716 --> 01:12:38.987
Well, I'm going this way.
Who's coming with me?

01:12:41.122 --> 01:12:44.859
Fine. I'll see you
all back at the van.

01:12:46.995 --> 01:12:48.595
I'm gonna go with him.

01:12:48.596 --> 01:12:51.265
Somebody has to protect
him from himself.

01:13:17.959 --> 01:13:20.093
What? Shh.

01:13:20.094 --> 01:13:21.696
It's close.

01:13:27.568 --> 01:13:28.636
What the hell?

01:13:41.449 --> 01:13:43.050
Where did it go?

01:13:43.051 --> 01:13:45.186
Come along.

01:13:56.397 --> 01:13:57.998
What happened?

01:13:57.999 --> 01:13:59.599
It's nothing.

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:01.201
Nothing? We just saw--
It's the house.

01:14:01.202 --> 01:14:04.405
The house is trying
to deceive us.

01:14:09.744 --> 01:14:11.344
Bibi!

01:14:11.345 --> 01:14:12.946
Johnny!

01:14:12.947 --> 01:14:14.015
Bibi!

01:14:24.692 --> 01:14:26.293
Johnny!

01:14:26.294 --> 01:14:28.429
Sister Gloria?

01:14:56.724 --> 01:14:58.325
What's that?

01:14:58.326 --> 01:14:59.926
Relax, Perry.

01:14:59.927 --> 01:15:02.062
I've heard the devil
described in many ways,

01:15:02.063 --> 01:15:04.731
but never with a squeak.

01:15:04.732 --> 01:15:06.333
Oh, my God!

01:15:06.334 --> 01:15:07.934
There's your devil for ya.

01:15:07.935 --> 01:15:11.138
He seems to have left his pitchfork
down in Hell, didn't he?

01:15:11.139 --> 01:15:12.205
Father, that's the guy.

01:15:12.206 --> 01:15:13.273
Hey, hold it right there!

01:15:13.274 --> 01:15:14.875
Perry, that's enough.

01:15:14.876 --> 01:15:15.942
No, Father, I need that!

01:15:15.943 --> 01:15:19.146
I don't want to hear it!

01:15:19.147 --> 01:15:20.213
Well, hello, Father.

01:15:20.214 --> 01:15:21.815
Good evening, son.

01:15:21.816 --> 01:15:25.552
Having a little Halloween fun here
at Hull House tonight, are you?

01:15:25.553 --> 01:15:27.687
Oh, yeah.

01:15:27.688 --> 01:15:30.891
Father, I have something
to confess to you.

01:15:30.892 --> 01:15:32.492
Would you like to
hear my confession?

01:15:32.493 --> 01:15:34.094
What? Now?

01:15:34.095 --> 01:15:37.298
I broke the fifth commandment.

01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:39.967
The fifth?

01:15:44.772 --> 01:15:46.373
Thou shalt not kill.

01:15:46.374 --> 01:15:48.508
You killed someone?

01:15:48.509 --> 01:15:51.178
Yes, Father.

01:15:51.179 --> 01:15:53.313
You.

01:15:53.314 --> 01:15:55.449
Get out of here, Father! Run!

01:15:56.517 --> 01:15:59.719
I'm heartily sorry
for offending thee,

01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:01.855
and I detest all of my sins,

01:16:01.856 --> 01:16:03.456
for I dread the loss of Heaven

01:16:03.457 --> 01:16:05.593
and the pain of Hell!

01:16:24.278 --> 01:16:25.346
Father?

01:16:26.948 --> 01:16:28.549
Father...

01:17:36.350 --> 01:17:38.485
Kurt?

01:17:38.486 --> 01:17:39.553
Is that you?

01:17:42.223 --> 01:17:43.823
Hey, J-boy.

01:17:43.824 --> 01:17:45.960
Heads up. Want to
shoot some hoop?

01:17:49.697 --> 01:17:51.831
He's dribbling down the court.
No one's near him!

01:17:51.832 --> 01:17:53.433
He's got 10 seconds left.
He's going around.

01:17:53.434 --> 01:17:56.102
Larry Bird shoots.
Nothing but net!

01:17:56.103 --> 01:17:58.238
He's racking up the
points tonight.

01:17:58.239 --> 01:18:00.908
Larry Bird's in the air.
Nothing but net!

01:18:09.984 --> 01:18:11.585
Uh-uh! Penalty for traveling.

01:18:15.856 --> 01:18:19.059
Hey, buddy boy, I thought
you'd be happy to see me.

01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:21.728
Well, if you're not,
I can fix that, too.

01:18:21.729 --> 01:18:24.397
No! Kurt, please!

01:18:24.398 --> 01:18:25.999
Kurt's not here right now.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.601
- 2 points!
- Time out, Kurt.

01:18:37.745 --> 01:18:38.812
Oh, where's a ref
when you need one?

01:18:38.813 --> 01:18:40.413
Technical foul.

01:18:40.414 --> 01:18:42.015
Wrong! Field goal!

01:18:42.016 --> 01:18:44.150
Oof!

01:18:44.151 --> 01:18:45.219
Ah!

01:18:47.355 --> 01:18:48.421
Come on, Johnny, let's go.

01:18:48.422 --> 01:18:49.622
Where's Father Bob? Don't ask.

01:19:15.116 --> 01:19:16.717
Batter up.

01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:21.522
Come on, toughie. Come on.

01:19:23.124 --> 01:19:24.725
Strike.

01:19:29.530 --> 01:19:32.198
Perry...

01:19:32.199 --> 01:19:34.334
You saved my life, man.

01:19:34.335 --> 01:19:35.936
Jesus.

01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:40.206
Holy water.

01:19:40.207 --> 01:19:43.411
John, please.

01:19:48.749 --> 01:19:50.885
Hang on, Perry.

01:19:54.622 --> 01:19:55.689
Come on, man.

01:20:03.164 --> 01:20:05.298
John...

01:20:05.299 --> 01:20:08.501
Do you remember the
story of Abraham?

01:20:08.502 --> 01:20:12.772
Willing to prove his devotion to the
Lord by sacrificing his own son,

01:20:12.773 --> 01:20:14.908
his own flesh and blood.

01:20:14.909 --> 01:20:17.578
I think that's Angela's plan.

01:20:19.180 --> 01:20:22.382
I think she's
gonna kill Mouse.

01:20:22.383 --> 01:20:26.653
Please, John, save Melissa.

01:20:26.654 --> 01:20:27.654
Please.

01:20:30.925 --> 01:20:31.991
Perry!

01:20:31.992 --> 01:20:34.128
Perry...

01:20:35.196 --> 01:20:36.797
Perry.

01:21:34.989 --> 01:21:36.590
Boo!

01:21:38.192 --> 01:21:40.326
Why, little miss prom queen.

01:21:40.327 --> 01:21:42.996
I've got a little something
special right here for you, baby.

01:21:42.997 --> 01:21:46.200
Woo hoo ha ha!

01:21:50.471 --> 01:21:53.140
I'll give you a ride you'd
never forget, baby.

01:21:54.208 --> 01:21:56.343
I like a rich bitch. No!

01:21:59.547 --> 01:22:01.147
No!

01:22:01.148 --> 01:22:03.816
Bitch.

01:22:03.817 --> 01:22:05.953
When you say no,
I know you mean yes.

01:22:08.088 --> 01:22:11.292
Leave a little room
for the Holy Ghost.

01:22:12.893 --> 01:22:15.028
I don't think so.

01:22:15.029 --> 01:22:16.096
Hi-ya!

01:22:20.367 --> 01:22:21.435
Hi-ya!

01:22:27.308 --> 01:22:28.375
Ah!

01:22:36.917 --> 01:22:40.120
Spare the rod and
spoil the child.

01:22:50.264 --> 01:22:51.331
Father Bob?

01:22:51.332 --> 01:22:52.932
Oh, thank God.

01:22:52.933 --> 01:22:54.000
Have you found Mouse?

01:22:54.001 --> 01:22:56.135
Oh, yes, I know
just where she is.

01:22:56.136 --> 01:22:57.738
Come, I'll take you to her!

01:23:03.611 --> 01:23:05.212
Blessed are the hopeless!

01:23:08.415 --> 01:23:11.084
The heirs of the Kingdom...

01:23:11.085 --> 01:23:12.151
of Hell!

01:23:12.152 --> 01:23:13.754
Ah!

01:23:21.228 --> 01:23:22.830
Agh!

01:24:01.802 --> 01:24:03.403
Well, well.

01:24:03.404 --> 01:24:04.470
Look out!

01:24:04.471 --> 01:24:05.539
Let's party here.

01:24:21.021 --> 01:24:22.623
Let's go.

01:24:34.902 --> 01:24:36.503
Melissa?

01:24:43.444 --> 01:24:45.044
Welcome.

01:24:45.045 --> 01:24:49.849
I'm so glad you could join us
on this very special occasion.

01:24:49.850 --> 01:24:52.518
Oh, we really can't stay.

01:24:52.519 --> 01:24:54.654
We've just come for Melissa.

01:24:54.655 --> 01:24:56.789
We're taking her home with us.

01:24:56.790 --> 01:24:58.925
Melissa?

01:24:58.926 --> 01:25:02.128
Oh, you mean Mouse.

01:25:02.129 --> 01:25:04.797
Well, I'm afraid you're
mistaken about that.

01:25:04.798 --> 01:25:07.467
You see, Mouse is home,

01:25:07.468 --> 01:25:09.068
and so are you.

01:25:09.069 --> 01:25:11.204
Or hadn't you figured
that out yet?

01:25:11.205 --> 01:25:14.407
This place is not a home.

01:25:14.408 --> 01:25:16.542
Oh, but it is.

01:25:16.543 --> 01:25:19.212
That's why I let you make
it all the way up here

01:25:19.213 --> 01:25:21.347
to the inner sanctum,

01:25:21.348 --> 01:25:24.017
the very threshold
of infinity.

01:25:44.304 --> 01:25:47.507
A river of holy water
wouldn't help you now.

01:25:47.508 --> 01:25:50.710
Abandon all hope.

01:25:50.711 --> 01:25:51.778
Close shave, Angela.

01:25:51.779 --> 01:25:52.845
Huh?

01:25:52.846 --> 01:25:54.981
But no cigar.

01:25:54.982 --> 01:25:56.048
Sister?

01:25:56.049 --> 01:25:59.786
You think I need holy
water to beat you?

01:25:59.787 --> 01:26:02.455
I've got all that
I need right here.

01:26:02.456 --> 01:26:05.658
It's a little thing
called faith.

01:26:05.659 --> 01:26:06.726
Faith?

01:26:06.727 --> 01:26:09.929
Your faith is a joke.

01:26:09.930 --> 01:26:13.132
Real faith can move mountains.

01:26:13.133 --> 01:26:16.870
Your faith can't
even move a mouse.

01:26:27.014 --> 01:26:30.750
If you really have
faith, prove it.

01:26:30.751 --> 01:26:34.487
Trade places with her.

01:26:34.488 --> 01:26:35.555
No, Sister, don't.
It's a trick.

01:26:35.556 --> 01:26:39.292
Your life for theirs.

01:26:39.293 --> 01:26:43.030
Come on, Sister.
Kick the habit.

01:26:44.631 --> 01:26:46.766
Let them go and I'll do it.

01:26:46.767 --> 01:26:47.767
Don't do it, Sister.

01:26:53.707 --> 01:26:57.443
Mouse, her soul
has great power.

01:26:57.444 --> 01:27:01.180
You will have all that power
if you chop off her head.

01:27:01.181 --> 01:27:02.783
No!

01:27:05.452 --> 01:27:07.054
Johnny!

01:27:09.723 --> 01:27:11.324
Don't fuck with me, kid.

01:27:11.325 --> 01:27:12.926
Bitch!

01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:23.070
You have to earn
your power, Mouse.

01:27:30.544 --> 01:27:33.212
Melissa...

01:27:33.213 --> 01:27:34.281
remember your faith.

01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:38.551
Now.

01:27:38.552 --> 01:27:40.686
I order you.

01:27:40.687 --> 01:27:43.357
I order you to kill her.

01:27:47.628 --> 01:27:49.229
Kill her!

01:27:50.831 --> 01:27:52.966
Now, Mouse.

01:27:55.636 --> 01:27:56.702
Do it.

01:27:56.703 --> 01:27:58.305
Now, Mouse!

01:28:05.779 --> 01:28:08.448
No!

01:28:12.719 --> 01:28:15.923
My name is Melissa.

01:28:18.592 --> 01:28:20.193
You bitch!

01:28:21.795 --> 01:28:23.931
Say your prayers.

01:29:05.038 --> 01:29:06.106
Let's get out of here.

01:29:15.182 --> 01:29:16.782
This room wasn't here before.

01:29:16.783 --> 01:29:18.384
No, it wasn't.

01:29:18.385 --> 01:29:19.986
The house won't let us leave!

01:29:19.987 --> 01:29:22.122
Here, let's try these windows.

01:29:39.206 --> 01:29:40.806
Angela.

01:29:40.807 --> 01:29:44.543
Where are you going? The
party's just begun.

01:29:44.544 --> 01:29:46.679
Oh, my God!

01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:48.815
Here's a little taste of hell.

01:29:55.756 --> 01:29:57.357
Run!

01:30:11.238 --> 01:30:13.373
Do something!

01:30:27.788 --> 01:30:29.389
Johnny!

01:30:32.059 --> 01:30:33.126
Oh!

01:30:38.999 --> 01:30:40.600
I hate you!

01:31:55.876 --> 01:31:58.011
Let's go home, children.

01:32:17.230 --> 01:32:18.297
Sister Gloria, are you okay?

01:32:18.298 --> 01:32:19.365
Yes, we're all right.

01:32:19.366 --> 01:32:20.967
We're all right, children.

01:32:22.569 --> 01:32:24.170
Where's Perry?

01:32:24.171 --> 01:32:25.772
What happened?

01:32:29.509 --> 01:32:33.780
