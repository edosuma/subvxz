[Hubbub]

02:32.480 --> 02:35.163
[Munches]

02:35.232 --> 02:39.672
- Ah. It was a fine meal.
- Yes, it was, wasn't it?

02:39.743 --> 02:41.270
Yes, what should we do now?

02:41.344 --> 02:44.956
- Let's have lunch.
- Oh, good idea.

02:45.024 --> 02:46.911
Quiet down, you villains.

02:46.975 --> 02:49.431
[Pumpkin] I'm being stolen.
Help me, help me!

02:49.503 --> 02:51.292
[Pumpkin] Put me down!

02:51.360 --> 02:53.694
[Children chatter]

02:53.760 --> 02:54.937
Hello.

02:56.096 --> 02:57.525
[Dog barks]

03:00.863 --> 03:02.587
What about my nose?

03:02.656 --> 03:03.604
[Yelps]

03:05.088 --> 03:07.576
[Woman, cackling]
Banana peels coming down!

03:09.824 --> 03:12.693
Come along, ladies.
Here's a nice Christmas turkey.

03:12.768 --> 03:15.419
Turkey.
Get your Christmas turkey.

03:15.488 --> 03:18.586
Hey, get back in the box, Martin!

03:18.655 --> 03:22.398
Get your boomerang fish.
Guaranteed fresh.

03:22.464 --> 03:26.293
Throw the fish away
and it comes back to me.

03:26.368 --> 03:28.059
Get 'em while they're fresh.

03:28.128 --> 03:30.135
- Christmas apples.
- We got Macintosh.

03:30.208 --> 03:32.095
- Christmas apples.
- Red Delicious.

03:32.160 --> 03:33.982
Tuppence apiece, while they last.

03:34.048 --> 03:37.114
We... They won't last long
the way you're eating them.

03:37.184 --> 03:39.835
I'm creating scarcity.
Drives the prices up.

03:39.904 --> 03:41.759
- Rizzo...
- [Rizzo clears throat]

03:41.824 --> 03:45.566
Hello. Welcome to
the Muppet Christmas Carol.

03:45.631 --> 03:47.289
I am here to tell the story.

03:47.359 --> 03:49.050
And I am here for the food.

03:49.119 --> 03:50.843
My name is Charles Dickens.

03:50.912 --> 03:52.821
And my name is Rizzo the Rat.

03:52.896 --> 03:55.482
Wait a second,
you're not Charles Dickens.

03:55.552 --> 03:56.729
I am, too.

03:56.799 --> 03:59.669
A blue furry Charles Dickens
who hangs out with a rat?

03:59.744 --> 04:00.823
Absolutely.

04:00.895 --> 04:03.579
Charles Dickens
was a 19th century novelist.

04:03.648 --> 04:04.825
A genius.

04:04.895 --> 04:06.619
You are too kind.

04:06.688 --> 04:08.510
Why should I believe you?

04:08.575 --> 04:12.023
Because I know the story of <i>A Christmas</i>
<i>Carol like the back of my hand.</i>

04:12.096 --> 04:14.201
- Prove it.
- All right.

04:14.272 --> 04:16.541
There's a little mole on my thumb.

04:16.607 --> 04:19.956
And a scar on my wrist
from when I fell off my bicycle...

04:20.031 --> 04:22.847
No, don't tell us your hand,
tell us the story.

04:22.912 --> 04:24.919
Oh, thank you. Yes.

04:24.991 --> 04:27.991
The Marleys were dead,
to begin with.

04:28.064 --> 04:29.209
The... Pardon me?

04:29.280 --> 04:30.938
That's how the story begins,

04:31.007 --> 04:33.309
"The Marleys were dead,
to begin with."

04:33.375 --> 04:35.709
As dead as a doornail.

04:35.776 --> 04:39.037
It's a good beginning.
It's creepy and kind of... spooky.

04:39.103 --> 04:41.689
- Thank you, Rizzo.
- You're welcome, Mr. Dickens.

04:41.760 --> 04:44.411
In life, the Marleys had been
business partners

04:44.480 --> 04:48.703
with a shrewd moneylender
named Ebenezer Scrooge.

04:48.768 --> 04:51.735
You will meet him
as he comes around that corner.

04:51.808 --> 04:53.052
- Where?
- There.

04:53.120 --> 04:55.127
- When?
- Now.

04:56.991 --> 05:00.308
[Dickens] There he is,
Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge.

05:04.224 --> 05:07.387
Say, is it getting cold around here?
[Shudders]

05:12.639 --> 05:15.323
<i>When a cold wind blows,</i>
<i>it chills you</i>

05:15.392 --> 05:17.301
<i>Chills you to the bone</i>

05:17.376 --> 05:19.765
<i>But there's nothing in nature</i>
<i>that freezes your heart</i>

05:19.840 --> 05:21.749
<i>Like years of being alone</i>

05:21.824 --> 05:24.507
<i>It paints you with indifference</i>

05:24.575 --> 05:26.812
<i>Like a lady paints with rouge</i>

05:26.880 --> 05:29.214
<i>And the worst of the worst,</i>
<i>the most hated and cursed</i>

05:29.279 --> 05:31.516
<i>Is the one that we call Scrooge</i>

05:31.583 --> 05:33.917
- <i>Unkind as any</i>
- <i>And the wrath of many</i>

05:33.984 --> 05:35.926
<i>This is Ebenezer Scrooge</i>

05:35.999 --> 05:40.734
<i>There goes Mr. Humbug</i>
<i>There goes Mr. Grim</i>

05:40.799 --> 05:43.320
<i>If they gave a prize for being mean</i>

05:43.392 --> 05:45.399
<i>The winner would be him</i>

05:45.472 --> 05:47.414
<i>Old Scrooge, he loves his money</i>

05:47.488 --> 05:50.139
<i>'Cause he thinks it gives him power</i>

05:50.208 --> 05:55.991
<i>If he became a flavor</i>
<i>You can bet he would be sour</i>

05:56.064 --> 05:58.235
Even the vegetables don't like him.

05:59.904 --> 06:04.181
<i>There goes Mr. Skinflint</i>
<i>There goes Mr. Greed</i>

06:04.639 --> 06:09.112
<i>The undisputed master</i>
<i>of the underhanded deed</i>

06:09.183 --> 06:11.158
<i>He charges folks a fortune</i>

06:11.232 --> 06:13.817
<i>For his dark and drafty houses</i>

06:13.887 --> 06:16.124
<i>Us poor folk live in misery</i>

06:16.192 --> 06:19.541
<i>It's even worse for mouses</i>

06:19.616 --> 06:22.998
Please, sir, I want some cheese.

06:23.071 --> 06:25.526
<i>He must be so lonely</i>

06:25.599 --> 06:27.803
<i>He must be so sad</i>

06:27.871 --> 06:32.443
<i>He goes to extremes</i>
<i>to convince us he's bad</i>

06:32.512 --> 06:34.901
<i>He's really a victim</i>

06:34.976 --> 06:37.277
<i>Of fear and of pride</i>

06:37.344 --> 06:42.745
<i>Look close and there must be</i>
<i>a sweet man inside</i>

06:43.520 --> 06:44.949
- Nah.
- Uh-uh.

06:45.024 --> 06:47.358
<i>There goes Mr. Outrage</i>

06:47.423 --> 06:49.790
<i>There goes Mr. Sneer</i>

06:49.855 --> 06:51.994
<i>He has no time for friends or fun</i>

06:52.064 --> 06:54.104
<i>His anger makes that clear</i>

06:54.176 --> 06:58.747
<i>Don't ask him for a favor</i>
<i>'cause his nastiness increases</i>

06:58.815 --> 07:01.271
<i>No crust of bread for those in need</i>

07:01.343 --> 07:04.093
<i>No cheeses for us "meeces"</i>

07:04.159 --> 07:05.817
Scrooge liked the cold.

07:05.887 --> 07:08.059
He was hard and sharp as a flint.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.884
Secret and self-contained.

07:09.952 --> 07:12.024
As solitary as an oyster.

07:12.095 --> 07:14.299
<i>There goes Mr. Heartless</i>

07:14.367 --> 07:16.472
<i>There goes Mr. Cruel</i>

07:16.543 --> 07:18.998
<i>He never gives</i>
<i>He only takes</i>

07:19.071 --> 07:21.176
<i>He lets his hunger rule</i>

07:21.247 --> 07:25.852
<i>If being mean's a way of life</i>
<i>you practice and rehearse</i>

07:25.920 --> 07:28.287
<i>Then all that work is paying off</i>

07:28.351 --> 07:30.904
<i>'Cause Scrooge is getting worse</i>

07:30.975 --> 07:35.448
<i>Every day, in every way</i>
<i>Scrooge is getting worse</i>

07:36.255 --> 07:38.197
- [male] Oh, boy.
- How the time flies.

07:38.271 --> 07:40.126
Look at this, I've got to move...

07:40.191 --> 07:41.784
[horse brays]

07:43.871 --> 07:45.148
Humbug.

07:51.103 --> 07:54.715
Phew! What an unpleasant fellow.

07:54.783 --> 07:59.966
He was a tightfisted hand
at the grindstone, Scroo...

08:00.031 --> 08:02.398
Boy, this really is a dirty city.

08:02.463 --> 08:04.732
Ha. You tellin' me.

08:05.535 --> 08:08.284
[Thud, squeaking]

08:08.352 --> 08:10.872
Thank you for making me
a part of this.

08:10.943 --> 08:14.718
He was a tightfisted hand
at the grindstone, Scrooge.

08:14.783 --> 08:18.711
A squeezing, wrenching,
grasping, clutching...

08:18.783 --> 08:20.987
covetous old sinner.

08:21.055 --> 08:22.844
[Gulps]

08:22.912 --> 08:24.505
Bob Cratchit?

08:24.576 --> 08:25.721
Yes, Mr. Scrooge?

08:25.792 --> 08:27.450
Who is this?

08:27.519 --> 08:29.079
Mr. Applegate, sir.

08:29.151 --> 08:31.672
He's here to speak to you
about his... mortgage.

08:31.744 --> 08:33.980
Mr. Scrooge,
I know you're very angry about this,

08:34.047 --> 08:36.469
and I didn't mean to
fall behind in the payment.

08:36.544 --> 08:38.813
Lord knows,
it being Christmas and all.

08:38.880 --> 08:40.886
Please don't shout at me, sir.

08:40.958 --> 08:43.861
That and, of course, little Gwen.
Her lungs aren't right.

08:43.934 --> 08:46.106
The doctor takes his share, don't he?

08:46.175 --> 08:48.182
You can yell and scream,
and you're right,

08:48.255 --> 08:49.946
but it won't do no good...

08:50.015 --> 08:52.568
because I'm the stone
you can't squeeze blood from.

08:52.639 --> 08:54.810
And that's the truth!

08:54.879 --> 08:57.083
[Applegate]
Thank you for not shouting at me.

08:57.151 --> 08:59.901
- [Door slams]
- [Workers] 17... 42...

08:59.967 --> 09:03.284
Let us deal with the eviction notices
for tomorrow, Mr. Cratchit.

09:03.359 --> 09:05.115
Uh...

09:05.183 --> 09:06.590
Tomorrow's Christmas, sir.

09:06.656 --> 09:10.300
Very well, you may gift wrap them.

09:10.367 --> 09:12.756
[Worker] Let us help you with that,
Mr. Cratchit.

09:12.832 --> 09:15.003
My, there are certainly a lot today.

09:15.071 --> 09:16.020
We'll get it.

09:16.095 --> 09:18.234
I'm okay, okay.

09:18.303 --> 09:20.158
- Here you go.
- Look out on that end...

09:20.223 --> 09:22.165
[clamoring]

09:22.239 --> 09:24.094
- Uh...
- [workers] Whoa!

09:25.439 --> 09:28.439
Christmas is a very busy time for us,
Mr. Cratchit.

09:28.511 --> 09:31.610
People preparing feasts, giving parties.

09:31.680 --> 09:35.062
Spending the mortgage money
on frivolities.

09:35.135 --> 09:38.681
One might say that December
is the foreclosure season.

09:38.752 --> 09:42.974
Harvest time for the moneylenders.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.501
- Boss, ask him.
- Tell him.

09:44.575 --> 09:47.674
- Come on. Come on.
- Do it now. Do it.

09:47.744 --> 09:50.493
If you please, Mr. Scrooge,
it's gotten colder.

09:50.559 --> 09:54.138
The bookkeeping staff would like to have
an extra shovel of coal for the fire.

09:54.208 --> 09:57.110
- We can't do the bookkeeping.
- Our pens are like ink-cicles.

09:57.183 --> 09:58.939
Our assets are frozen.

09:59.008 --> 10:02.652
How would the bookkeepers
like to be suddenly unemployed?

10:02.719 --> 10:04.475
[All] Heat wave!

10:04.543 --> 10:07.860
[All sing]
This is my island in the sun!

10:07.935 --> 10:11.132
I, I believe you've convinced them
once again, Mr. Scrooge.

10:14.207 --> 10:16.891
At that moment,
who should arrive at the door

10:16.959 --> 10:20.887
but Scrooge's nephew, Fred.
His only living relative.

10:20.959 --> 10:23.348
- Nephew Fred? I don't see him.
- Trust me.

10:24.799 --> 10:26.839
Hello? Uncle?

10:28.959 --> 10:29.908
Rizzo?

10:29.984 --> 10:32.318
You're very good at that, Mr. Dickens.

10:32.383 --> 10:35.514
A merry Christmas, Uncle Scrooge.
God save you.

10:35.583 --> 10:37.110
Merry Christmas?

10:37.183 --> 10:39.354
Bah. Humbug!

10:39.423 --> 10:41.333
Quick, it'll be warmer in there.

10:45.344 --> 10:48.857
Christmas a humbug, Uncle?
You don't mean that, surely.

10:48.928 --> 10:50.870
Actually, I think it's colder in here.

10:50.943 --> 10:53.726
Merry Christmas, you say?
What right have you to be merry?

10:53.791 --> 10:55.220
You're poor enough.

10:55.296 --> 10:57.368
And you to be dismal?
You're rich enough.

10:57.439 --> 10:59.511
He's got him.
The old boy's speechless.

10:59.583 --> 11:01.558
If I could work my will,

11:01.631 --> 11:04.664
every idiot who goes about with
"Merry Christmas" on his lips

11:04.735 --> 11:06.491
would be cooked with his own turkey

11:06.559 --> 11:09.494
and buried with a stake of holly
through his heart.

11:09.567 --> 11:11.323
Well, not quite speechless.

11:11.391 --> 11:12.820
- Uncle...
- Nephew.

11:12.895 --> 11:16.604
You keep Christmas in your own way,
and let me keep it in mine.

11:16.672 --> 11:20.446
Christmas is a loving,
honest and charitable time.

11:20.512 --> 11:23.894
And though it's never put
a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket,

11:23.967 --> 11:26.585
I believe Christmas has done me good
and will do me good,

11:26.655 --> 11:28.248
and I say, God bless it.

11:28.319 --> 11:30.042
[Workers cheer]

11:30.112 --> 11:33.789
And how does one celebrate Christmas
on the unemployment line?

11:35.967 --> 11:38.815
Now, in these times,
it was customary on Christmas Eve

11:38.879 --> 11:41.465
for well-meaning gentlemen
to call upon businesses,

11:41.535 --> 11:45.080
collecting donations
for the poor and homeless.

11:45.727 --> 11:47.669
Mr. Scrooge, I presume?

11:47.744 --> 11:49.118
[High-pitched squeak]

11:50.079 --> 11:51.224
Who are you?

11:51.295 --> 11:54.840
We're from the Order of Victoria
Charity Foundation.

11:54.911 --> 11:57.595
We'd like to speak to you
about a donation.

11:57.663 --> 11:59.518
Ah! Welcome!

11:59.583 --> 12:02.071
This jolly old gentleman here
is Mr. Scrooge.

12:02.144 --> 12:04.413
He's very generous to charities.

12:04.479 --> 12:05.940
My dear nephew!

12:06.015 --> 12:08.950
At this festive season of the year,
Mr. Scrooge,

12:09.023 --> 12:13.147
many of us feel we must
take care of our poor and homeless.

12:13.215 --> 12:15.670
Are there no prisons?
No poor houses?

12:15.743 --> 12:17.914
Oh, plenty of those, sir.

12:17.983 --> 12:19.576
Oh. Excellent.

12:19.647 --> 12:21.370
For a moment, I was worried.

12:21.439 --> 12:25.531
Some of us are endeavoring to raise
a fund for the poor and homeless.

12:25.599 --> 12:27.900
What might I put you down for?

12:27.967 --> 12:28.949
Nothing.

12:29.023 --> 12:32.918
- You wish to remain anonymous?
- I wish to be left alone.

12:32.991 --> 12:34.966
I do not make merry myself
for Christmas.

12:35.040 --> 12:36.087
That certainly is true.

12:36.223 --> 12:38.110
I cannot afford
to make idle people merry.

12:38.175 --> 12:39.669
That is certainly not true.

12:39.743 --> 12:42.263
Don't you have other things to do
this afternoon?

12:42.335 --> 12:45.651
Sadly, I do, Uncle.
So I shall make my donation.

12:45.727 --> 12:48.247
And leave you to make yours.

12:48.319 --> 12:49.978
Thank you so very much.

12:50.047 --> 12:54.040
Oh, Uncle, come and have Christmas
dinner with me and Clara tomorrow.

12:54.111 --> 12:55.867
Why ever did you get married?

12:55.935 --> 12:57.877
Why? Because I fell in love.

12:57.951 --> 12:59.893
[Laughs]

12:59.967 --> 13:03.098
That's the only thing in the world
sillier than a merry Christmas.

13:03.167 --> 13:05.917
It's no use, I shall keep
my Christmas humor to the last.

13:05.983 --> 13:09.278
A merry Christmas to you.
And a happy New Year.

13:09.343 --> 13:11.645
- Merry Christmas, Fred.
- Merry Christmas, Bob.

13:11.711 --> 13:12.988
Humbug!

13:14.175 --> 13:15.866
[Softly] Ahem.

13:15.935 --> 13:18.237
[Clock ticks]

13:23.999 --> 13:26.650
Now, then, sir, about the...

13:26.719 --> 13:28.345
donation.

13:29.023 --> 13:30.812
Well, now.

13:30.879 --> 13:32.537
Let's see.

13:33.727 --> 13:36.596
I know how to treat the poor.

13:36.671 --> 13:39.967
My taxes go to pay for the prisons
and the poorhouses.

13:40.031 --> 13:42.682
- The homeless must go there.
- But some would rather die.

13:42.751 --> 13:45.238
If they'd rather die,
then they'd better do it,

13:45.311 --> 13:47.221
and decrease the surplus population.

13:47.295 --> 13:49.848
- [Squeaks]
- Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

13:49.919 --> 13:53.662
This is the door, you may use it.

13:53.727 --> 13:55.516
All right, Beaker, come along.

13:55.583 --> 13:59.357
I think we've taken enough
of Mr. Scrooge's time.

13:59.423 --> 14:02.205
- [Beaker squeaks]
- Oh, dear. Dear, dear.

14:02.271 --> 14:05.784
- [Door slams]
- [Workers] 17... 24... 58.

14:05.855 --> 14:08.790

14:08.863 --> 14:11.929

<i>deep and crisp and even</i>

14:11.999 --> 14:14.683
<i>Brightly shone the moon</i>

<i>Though... the...</i>

14:16.351 --> 14:17.463

14:18.399 --> 14:22.490
- What do you want?
- Uh... Penny for the song, guvnor?

14:26.783 --> 14:28.027
[Gasps]

14:28.543 --> 14:30.004
Wh... Ow!

14:30.719 --> 14:31.799
[Groans]

14:32.959 --> 14:34.585
[Worker] 17... 24...

14:47.647 --> 14:52.633
[clears throat] Excuse me, Mr. Scrooge,
but it appears to be closing time.

14:53.759 --> 14:57.752
Very well. I'll see you
at eight tomorrow morning.

14:58.975 --> 15:00.252
[Workers] Ask him, ask him.

15:00.319 --> 15:02.042
Um... Tomorrow's Christmas.

15:02.111 --> 15:04.315
- 8:30, then.
- [Workers sigh]

15:04.383 --> 15:05.725
If you please, sir,

15:05.791 --> 15:08.573
half an hour off hardly seems customary
for Christmas Day.

15:08.639 --> 15:11.454
- [Worker] No.
- [Worker 2] Hardly customary.

15:11.519 --> 15:14.170
How much time off is customary,
Mr. Cratchit?

15:14.239 --> 15:17.687
Um... Why, um, the, er, whole day.

15:17.759 --> 15:19.547
- Yeah, that's right.
- The whole day.

15:19.615 --> 15:20.924
The entire day?

15:20.991 --> 15:22.933
- No.
- That's the frog's idea.

15:23.007 --> 15:25.974
If you please,
why open the office tomorrow?

15:26.047 --> 15:29.396
Other businesses will be closed.
You'll have no one to do business with.

15:29.471 --> 15:32.787
It'll waste a lot of expensive coal
for the fire.

15:32.863 --> 15:35.896
- That's definitely a point.
- That's a point.

15:35.967 --> 15:39.545
It's a poor excuse for picking
a man's pocket every December the 25th.

15:39.614 --> 15:42.200
[All groan]

15:42.271 --> 15:45.370
But as I seem to be
the only person around who knows that...

15:46.623 --> 15:49.209
...take the day off.
- [All cheer]

15:53.535 --> 15:55.674
- Will you stop that?
- [Workers yelp]

15:57.023 --> 15:58.932
Thank you, Mr. Scrooge.

16:00.575 --> 16:02.463
Be here all the earlier
the next morning.

16:02.527 --> 16:05.047
- [Worker] Okay.
- [Worker 2] You bet. First thing.

16:08.223 --> 16:10.295
With their employer gone at last,

16:10.367 --> 16:12.887
Bob Cratchit and the bookkeepers
immediately began

16:12.959 --> 16:17.596
that most pleasant of activities,
the celebration of Christmas.

16:17.662 --> 16:20.510
- He's gone!
- [Workers cheer]

16:20.575 --> 16:22.811
Gentlemen, let's close up for Christmas.

16:24.575 --> 16:27.423
<i>There's magic in the air this evening</i>

16:27.487 --> 16:29.527
<i>Magic in the air</i>

16:29.599 --> 16:32.249
<i>The world is at her best, you know</i>

16:32.319 --> 16:34.653
<i>When people love and care</i>

16:34.719 --> 16:38.996
<i>The promise of excitement</i>
<i>is one the night will keep</i>

16:39.071 --> 16:43.806
<i>After all, there's only</i>
<i>one more sleep till Christmas</i>

16:54.239 --> 16:56.061
<i>The world has got a smile</i>

16:56.127 --> 16:58.996
<i>Today, the world has got a glow</i>

16:59.071 --> 17:01.754
<i>There's no such thing as strangers</i>

17:01.822 --> 17:03.764
<i>When a stranger says hello</i>

17:03.839 --> 17:06.261
<i>And everyone is family</i>

17:06.335 --> 17:08.539
<i>We're having so much fun</i>

17:08.607 --> 17:13.340
<i>After all, there's only one</i>
<i>more sleep till Christmas</i>

17:15.358 --> 17:17.464
Okay, ready. Here we go.

17:31.742 --> 17:33.204
That's it. Ha! Ha!

17:33.279 --> 17:35.188
- [Others cheer]
- Mm-hm.

17:37.151 --> 17:39.223
Very good, gentlemen.

17:41.023 --> 17:45.333
<i>'Tis the season to be jolly and joyous</i>

17:46.271 --> 17:49.566
<i>With a burst of pleasure,</i>
<i>we feel it arrive</i>

17:51.038 --> 17:55.381
<i>It's a season</i>
<i>when the saints can employ us</i>

17:55.455 --> 18:00.124
<i>To spread the news about peace</i>
<i>and to keep love alive</i>

18:00.191 --> 18:01.368
What's that?

18:01.439 --> 18:04.287
Look, it's the penguins'
Christmas skating party.

18:10.879 --> 18:12.766
[Quacking]

18:20.190 --> 18:22.295
- Hmm. Ah.
- Look at that!

18:28.511 --> 18:30.551
You did good, boss.

18:30.623 --> 18:33.525
Oh, thank you.
Thank you very much.

18:37.855 --> 18:39.742
Wow!

18:39.807 --> 18:41.945
- No way.
- Come on, Rizzo.

18:46.751 --> 18:47.699
Boy.

18:51.103 --> 18:52.347
Fun, huh?

18:52.415 --> 18:54.619
- Merry Christmas, penguins.
- [All quack]

18:56.799 --> 18:59.101
<i>There's something in the wind today</i>

18:59.167 --> 19:01.654
<i>That's good for everyone</i>

19:01.726 --> 19:04.148
<i>Yes, faith is in our hearts today</i>

19:04.223 --> 19:06.361
<i>We're shining like the sun</i>

19:06.430 --> 19:08.983
<i>And everyone can feel it</i>

19:09.054 --> 19:11.062
<i>The feeling's running deep</i>

19:11.135 --> 19:15.924
<i>After all, there's only</i>
<i>one more sleep till Christmas</i>

19:15.999 --> 19:19.927
<i>After all, there's only one more sleep</i>

19:19.999 --> 19:24.374
<i>Till Christmas Day</i>

19:24.447 --> 19:26.356
Merry Christmas!

19:38.367 --> 19:39.741
[Dog barks]

19:44.574 --> 19:47.193
Scrooge lived in chambers
which had once belonged

19:47.263 --> 19:50.230
to his old business partners,
Jacob and Robert Marley.

19:50.303 --> 19:52.245
- Have some bread?
- Not while I'm working.

19:52.319 --> 19:54.206
Suit yourself.

19:54.270 --> 19:58.067
The building was a dismal heap of brick
on a dark street.

19:58.143 --> 20:01.274
Once again, you must remember
that the Marleys were dead

20:01.342 --> 20:03.993
- and decaying in their graves.
- Yeuch!

20:04.063 --> 20:06.202
[Whispers] That one thing
you must remember,

20:06.271 --> 20:08.605
or nothing that follows
will seem wondrous.

20:08.670 --> 20:10.132
Why are you whispering?

20:10.207 --> 20:12.312
- It's for dramatic emphasis.
- Oh.

20:12.383 --> 20:13.757
Shh.

20:36.670 --> 20:37.947
Jacob Marley?

20:38.015 --> 20:40.120
[Booming groan]

20:43.326 --> 20:44.788
You okay?

20:55.391 --> 20:56.667
Humbug.

20:59.550 --> 21:01.917
Oh. Gonzo, speak to me.

21:01.982 --> 21:05.659
I mean, Mr. Dickens.
Charlie! Are you hurt?

21:05.726 --> 21:08.760
To say that Scrooge
was not startled would be untrue.

21:08.831 --> 21:12.126
Still, the moment had passed,
and the world was as it should be.

21:12.190 --> 21:14.646
He ain't hurt.
Didn't even break his concentration.

21:14.718 --> 21:16.376
- Hmm?
- Nothing.

21:20.926 --> 21:23.544
Come on, Rizzo.
We'll follow him in.

21:23.614 --> 21:27.062
In a minute.
I had a bag of jelly beans over here.

21:27.134 --> 21:28.792
Will you just get over here?

21:28.862 --> 21:30.935
- All right.
- Sheesh.

21:32.319 --> 21:34.359
- [Dickens groans]
- Oh-oh.

21:36.030 --> 21:37.110
Steady, steady.

21:37.183 --> 21:39.550
[Strangulated]
Scrooge made his way up the stairs,

21:39.614 --> 21:41.524
caring not a button for the darkness.

21:41.598 --> 21:44.053
Darkness was cheap,
and Scrooge liked it.

21:46.142 --> 21:49.720
<i>But the incident at the door</i>
<i>had made Scrooge wary.</i>

21:49.791 --> 21:53.947
<i>Before he shut himself in for the night,</i>
<i>he searched his rooms.</i>

21:54.014 --> 21:56.348
<i>- [Rizzo] Okay, that does it.</i>
<i>- [Dickens] Pardon?</i>

21:56.415 --> 21:58.586
How do you know
what Scrooge is doing?

21:58.655 --> 22:00.760
We're down here and he's up there.

22:00.831 --> 22:04.443
I keep telling you, storytellers
are omniscient. I know everything.

22:04.511 --> 22:07.293
Hoity-toity, Mr. Godlike Smarty-Pants.

22:09.567 --> 22:13.364
To conduct a proper search,
Scrooge was forced to light the lamps.

22:15.038 --> 22:16.696
How does he do that?

22:48.606 --> 22:50.101
Agh!

22:57.790 --> 22:59.034
Oh.

23:00.126 --> 23:02.363
It's my best dressing gown.

23:05.599 --> 23:07.606
No harm done.

23:32.190 --> 23:33.434
[Ding]

23:33.502 --> 23:35.739
[Clock ticks]

23:36.415 --> 23:37.876

23:43.966 --> 23:45.821
[Ringing]

23:56.158 --> 23:58.460
[Scrooge breathes heavily]

24:11.391 --> 24:13.147
[Faint clinking]

24:15.518 --> 24:17.907
[Laughter]

24:17.982 --> 24:20.568
Look, it's Ebenezer Scrooge.

24:20.639 --> 24:23.257
Looking older and more wicked
than ever.

24:23.326 --> 24:25.301
I knew he wouldn't disappoint us.

24:25.375 --> 24:27.131
[Both laugh]

24:29.950 --> 24:30.997
Who are you?

24:31.070 --> 24:32.958
In life, we were your partners,

24:33.022 --> 24:36.153
- Jacob...
- And Robert Marley.

24:36.222 --> 24:38.262
It looks like you.

24:38.334 --> 24:42.109
- But I don't believe it.
- Why do you doubt your senses?

24:42.174 --> 24:45.174
Because a little thing
can affect them.

24:45.246 --> 24:48.595
A slight disorder of the stomach
can make them cheat.

24:48.671 --> 24:52.380
You may be a bit of undigested beef.
A blob of mustard.

24:52.446 --> 24:54.170
A crumb of cheese.

24:54.239 --> 24:57.719
Yes, there's more of gravy
than of grave about you.

24:57.790 --> 24:59.513
[Both laugh]

25:00.287 --> 25:02.326
More of gravy than of grave?

25:02.398 --> 25:05.300
What a terrible pun.
Where do you get those jokes?

25:05.374 --> 25:07.447
Leave comedy to the bears, Ebenezer.

25:09.406 --> 25:13.203
Please, Jacob, Robert,
don't criticize me.

25:13.279 --> 25:14.969
You always criticized me.

25:15.038 --> 25:16.794
We were always heckling you.

25:16.863 --> 25:18.717
It's good to be heckling again.

25:18.783 --> 25:20.855
It's good to be doing anything again.

25:22.814 --> 25:24.440
Why do you come to me?

25:24.510 --> 25:29.212
<i>We're Marley and Marley</i>
<i>Avarice and greed</i>

25:29.278 --> 25:33.817
<i>We took advantage of the poor,</i>
<i>just ignored the need-y</i>

25:33.886 --> 25:38.109
<i>We specialized in causing pain,</i>
<i>spreading fear and doubt</i>

25:38.174 --> 25:42.298
<i>And if you could not pay the rent,</i>
<i>we simply threw you out</i>

25:43.647 --> 25:46.549
There was the year
we evicted the entire orphanage.

25:46.623 --> 25:50.649
I remember the little tykes
all standing in the snowbank.

25:50.719 --> 25:53.435
With their little
frostbitten teddy bears.

25:56.991 --> 26:01.213
<i>We're Marley and Marley</i>
<i>Our hearts were painted black</i>

26:01.279 --> 26:03.766
<i>We should have known our evil deeds</i>

26:03.838 --> 26:06.326
<i>Would put us both in shack-les</i>

26:06.398 --> 26:10.489
<i>Captive, bound, we're double-ironed,</i>
<i>exhausted by the weight</i>

26:10.558 --> 26:12.947
<i>As freedom comes from giving love</i>

26:13.022 --> 26:15.258
<i>So prison comes with hate</i>

<i>We're Marley and Marley</i>

26:20.222 --> 26:22.132
<i>We're Marley and Marley</i>

26:23.902 --> 26:27.164
But my friends, you were not unfeeling
towards your fellow men.

26:27.230 --> 26:30.361
True, there was something
about mankind we loved.

26:30.431 --> 26:32.121
I think it was their money.

26:32.190 --> 26:34.198
[Marley Brothers laugh]

26:34.271 --> 26:38.394
<i>Doomed, Scrooge</i>
<i>You're doomed for all time</i>

26:55.295 --> 26:57.880
- [Both wail]
- The chains.

26:57.950 --> 27:01.812
We forged these chains in life
by our acts of greed.

27:01.886 --> 27:03.926
You wear such a chain yourself.

27:03.998 --> 27:06.649
Humbug. Speak comfort to me, friends.

27:06.719 --> 27:08.126
Comfort!

27:08.190 --> 27:09.913
[Both wail]

27:09.982 --> 27:12.666
You will be haunted by three spirits.

27:12.734 --> 27:14.905
Haunted?
I've already had enough of that.

27:14.974 --> 27:19.000
Without these visits, you cannot hope
to avoid the path we tread.

27:19.070 --> 27:22.419
Expect the first ghost tonight,
when the bell tolls one.

27:22.494 --> 27:24.763
Can't I meet them all at once
and get it over with?

27:54.815 --> 27:58.808
And with that, the spirits of Scrooge's
partners vanished into the darkness,

27:58.878 --> 28:03.482
leaving him once again
alone in his room.

28:03.550 --> 28:07.479
That's scary stuff. Should we be worried
about the kids in the audience?

28:07.551 --> 28:09.885
No, it's all right. This is culture.

28:09.950 --> 28:12.765
Jelly bean? I had them
in my pocket all along.

28:12.830 --> 28:14.172
[Groans]

28:14.238 --> 28:15.186
What?

28:27.070 --> 28:28.346
Humbug.

28:29.438 --> 28:31.161
Come on.

28:31.230 --> 28:32.791
But I really hate this.

28:32.863 --> 28:34.750
You wanted to know
what was happening.

28:34.814 --> 28:38.109
Scrooge's bedchamber
is on this side of the house. Jump.

28:38.174 --> 28:40.694
There's only two things
in this life I hate.

28:40.766 --> 28:42.905
Heights, and jumping from them.

28:42.974 --> 28:45.112
Too late now.
Come on, I'll catch you.

28:45.182 --> 28:46.873
[Whimpers]

28:46.942 --> 28:49.179
God save my little broken body.

28:49.246 --> 28:51.155
[Screams]

28:55.454 --> 28:57.242
- Missed.
- [Growls]

28:57.310 --> 28:59.896
Wait a second.
I forgot my jelly beans.

28:59.966 --> 29:00.981
Um...

29:08.510 --> 29:09.557
What?

29:09.630 --> 29:11.386
You can fit through those bars?

29:11.454 --> 29:12.916
Yeah.

29:12.990 --> 29:14.331
You are such an idiot.

29:14.398 --> 29:16.253
What, what? Hey, what?

29:16.798 --> 29:17.976
What?

29:18.046 --> 29:19.507
[Rizzo whispers] What?

29:24.702 --> 29:26.557
[Scrooge breathes heavily]

29:28.030 --> 29:29.721
[Ticking]

29:32.798 --> 29:34.325
[Rizzo] Oh, dear.

29:34.398 --> 29:38.588
Scrooge slipped into the empty silence
of a dreamless sleep.

29:38.654 --> 29:41.970
You know, a guy could break his tail
falling out of this tree.

29:42.046 --> 29:43.955
Want to see what's going on, don't you?

29:44.030 --> 29:46.070
- Yes.
- There's Scrooge's window.

29:46.142 --> 29:47.865
Oh, yeah.

29:47.934 --> 29:49.690
[Clock ticks]

29:50.462 --> 29:52.535
[Clock whirs, chimes]

29:59.038 --> 30:00.380
[Ding]

30:06.239 --> 30:11.094
Expect the first ghost
when the bell tolls one!

30:13.790 --> 30:15.448
Wow! Ouch.

30:36.030 --> 30:39.194
Are you the spirit
whose coming was foretold to me?

30:39.262 --> 30:40.440
I am.

30:40.510 --> 30:44.820
But... you're just a child.

30:44.893 --> 30:47.927
I can remember nearly 1,900 years.

30:47.998 --> 30:51.031
I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.

30:51.102 --> 30:52.793
What business has brought you here?

30:52.862 --> 30:55.448
- Your welfare.
- Huh.

30:55.518 --> 30:58.071
A night's unbroken rest
might aid my welfare.

30:58.142 --> 31:00.247
Your salvation, then.

31:00.318 --> 31:02.903
Take heed. Come.

31:07.582 --> 31:11.324
I beg you, spirit, I am mortal.
I'm liable to fall.

31:11.390 --> 31:14.586
A touch of my hand, and you shall fly.

31:22.174 --> 31:24.084
- What are we doing?
- Nothing.

31:24.158 --> 31:25.718
- What?
- Just hold on.

31:25.790 --> 31:27.797
[Rizzo screams]

31:30.206 --> 31:32.662
- Watch out, Rizzo.
- What? Oh!

31:32.734 --> 31:35.636
[Dickens laughs] Whee!

31:36.286 --> 31:38.009
Hello, London!

31:38.078 --> 31:40.020
[Rizzo] Goodbye, lunch!

31:41.118 --> 31:43.573
[Pants] Spirit?

31:44.318 --> 31:45.397
Yes?

31:45.470 --> 31:47.096
Nothing.

31:48.830 --> 31:51.034
- Look, Rizzo.
- I don't want to look.

31:51.102 --> 31:53.785
Spirit? What is that light?

31:55.294 --> 31:57.082
It cannot be dawn.

31:57.150 --> 31:59.353
[Spirit] It is the past.

32:02.366 --> 32:04.886
Look, it's beautiful, Rizzo.

32:04.958 --> 32:07.162
[Rizzo] Mommy!

32:14.014 --> 32:15.924
Hey, we're going down.

32:16.510 --> 32:18.844
Hang on, Rizzo.

32:18.910 --> 32:21.496
- [Woman screams]
- [Dickens] Sorry, madam.

32:21.566 --> 32:23.421
- [Man grunts]
- [Rizzo] Pardon me, sir.

32:23.486 --> 32:25.242
[Dickens] Look out, Rizzo.

32:28.221 --> 32:30.229
Rizzo, this is Louise.

32:30.302 --> 32:32.211
Yeah, we've met.

32:41.022 --> 32:45.430
And so they arrived
in Ebenezer Scrooge's childhood.

32:45.501 --> 32:47.803
That was the worst trip of my life.

32:47.870 --> 32:49.179
It's over now.

32:49.246 --> 32:52.180
- Yeah, safe at last.
- [Meows]

32:52.990 --> 32:53.938
No.

32:54.622 --> 32:56.989
No. No! Oh, no!

32:57.054 --> 32:58.396
Nice kitty, nice kitty.

32:58.462 --> 33:00.404
Ow! I'm from New Jersey.

33:00.478 --> 33:02.103
[Cat meows, kids shout]

33:03.102 --> 33:05.491
It was the afternoon of Christmas Eve,

33:05.566 --> 33:08.729
and Scrooge was conscious
of a thousand odors.

33:08.797 --> 33:13.686
Each one connected with a thousand
thoughts, hopes, joys and cares,

33:13.758 --> 33:15.830
long, long forgotten.

33:17.918 --> 33:19.827
It's my old school.

33:20.734 --> 33:22.294
I was a boy here.

33:23.262 --> 33:25.782
That's Henry.

33:25.854 --> 33:28.025
And Edmund, my best friend.

33:28.094 --> 33:30.614
Hello, boys. Hello.

33:30.686 --> 33:33.336
These are but shadows
of your past, Ebenezer.

33:33.405 --> 33:35.926
They can neither see nor hear you.

33:35.998 --> 33:38.234
Come, let us go inside.

33:40.510 --> 33:42.420
Rizzo, stop playing with the cat.

33:42.493 --> 33:45.079
- Save me, save me!
- [Cat meows viciously]

34:02.909 --> 34:06.204
And what a flood of memories
came back to him,

34:06.270 --> 34:09.270
as Scrooge beheld his old classroom.

34:10.270 --> 34:12.310
I know it all so well, spirit.

34:13.246 --> 34:14.904
The desks.

34:16.062 --> 34:18.036
The smell of the chalk.

34:20.350 --> 34:22.455
I chose my profession in this room.

34:22.525 --> 34:25.143
And is he, too, familiar?

34:27.998 --> 34:31.511
[Dickens] Scrooge beheld a small boy,
a boy he knew,

34:31.581 --> 34:33.949
oh, very well indeed.

34:36.766 --> 34:39.253
Good heavens.

34:39.326 --> 34:40.820
It's me.

34:40.893 --> 34:43.228
Come Ebenezer,
the last coach is leaving.

34:43.293 --> 34:45.496
Come on,
he never goes home for Christmas.

34:45.565 --> 34:47.802
Who cares about stupid old Christmas?

34:49.693 --> 34:51.766
I was often alone.

34:52.925 --> 34:56.406
More time for reading... and study.

34:56.478 --> 35:00.252
The Christmas holiday was a chance
to get some extra work done.

35:01.342 --> 35:03.993
A time for... solitude.

35:07.006 --> 35:09.275
Rats don't understand these things.

35:09.342 --> 35:11.382
You were never a lonely child?

35:11.454 --> 35:14.749
I had 1,274 brothers and sisters.

35:14.813 --> 35:18.643
Sheesh.
Rats don't understand these things.

35:18.718 --> 35:22.100
Let us see another Christmas
in this place.

35:22.174 --> 35:24.246
They were all very much the same.

35:26.589 --> 35:28.280
Nothing ever changed.

35:28.349 --> 35:30.357
You changed.

35:50.302 --> 35:52.887
[Dickens] The years performed
their terrible dance.

35:52.957 --> 35:56.951
And in a moment, Scrooge had seen
his entire childhood pass.

35:57.022 --> 36:01.015
He saw his old school room
age and decay.

36:01.085 --> 36:02.841
What the... Hey!

36:02.909 --> 36:03.858
Agh!

36:03.933 --> 36:07.643
So, Master Scrooge, graduation day!

36:08.702 --> 36:11.735
That's my old headmaster.

36:11.805 --> 36:13.911
This man taught me my greatest lesson.

36:13.981 --> 36:17.298
Stand up. Build your life
as this school was built.

36:17.374 --> 36:18.388
Push!

36:18.462 --> 36:20.371
[Strains] My ear, my ear, my ear.

36:22.302 --> 36:27.190
Yes, work hard, work long,
and be constructive.

36:27.261 --> 36:30.076
Ebenezer, life is a golden opportunity.

36:30.141 --> 36:32.956
Today you go forth into the real world.

36:33.021 --> 36:35.803
You must keep your nose
to the grindstone.

36:35.870 --> 36:38.041
Work hard, lad. And one day,

36:38.110 --> 36:40.979
your life will be as solid
as this very building.

36:42.846 --> 36:45.301
Hmm. I've been meaning
to fix that shelf.

36:45.374 --> 36:46.551
Yes, headmaster.

36:46.621 --> 36:51.477
Young man, you have been apprenticed
to a fine company in London.

36:51.550 --> 36:55.347
Today, you become a man of business.

36:55.422 --> 36:57.331
I'm looking forward to it, headmaster.

36:57.406 --> 36:59.740
You will love business.

36:59.805 --> 37:01.976
It is the American way.

37:02.046 --> 37:02.994
Sam?

37:03.070 --> 37:05.437
- Mmm?
- [Whispers]

37:06.365 --> 37:08.918
Oh. It is the British way.

37:08.990 --> 37:09.938
Good.

37:10.013 --> 37:11.802
Yes, headmaster.

37:15.581 --> 37:17.818
[Headmaster]
Oh, here is your coach, Ebenezer.

37:17.885 --> 37:21.082
Come, Scrooge, there is much to see.

37:22.718 --> 37:24.627
Remember, don't tip the driver.

37:32.861 --> 37:36.790
A moment later, Scrooge found himself
standing on a city street,

37:36.861 --> 37:40.790
looking at a building
he had not seen in years.

37:40.862 --> 37:43.895
Tell me, Ebenezer Scrooge,
do you know this place?

37:43.965 --> 37:47.314
Know it? My first job was here.

37:47.390 --> 37:49.943
This is Fozziwig's
old rubber chicken factory.

37:50.014 --> 37:51.737
Once again, it was Christmas Eve,

37:51.805 --> 37:56.661
night was falling, and the lamplighters
were plying their trade.

37:56.734 --> 38:00.050
Hey, light the lamp, not the rat.
Light the lamp, not the rat!

38:00.125 --> 38:01.816
- My apologies.
- What are you doing?

38:01.886 --> 38:04.025
Put me out, put me out!

38:04.094 --> 38:06.428
- Rizzo!
- What?

38:06.493 --> 38:08.315
[Screams]

38:08.381 --> 38:09.658
[Gurgling]

38:09.725 --> 38:12.791
[Shivers]
Oh, oh, Th-th-th-thank you.

38:12.861 --> 38:14.519
You're welcome.

38:16.798 --> 38:19.416
There he is, old Fozziwig himself.

38:19.485 --> 38:22.998
Look my lads, dusk has fallen,
and the lamplighters are at work.

38:23.069 --> 38:25.208
It's Christmas Eve for certain.

38:25.278 --> 38:27.165
What an employer he was.

38:27.229 --> 38:30.458
As hard and as ruthless
as a rose petal.

38:30.526 --> 38:32.697
It's time for the party to begin.

38:32.765 --> 38:35.285
It's the Fozziwig Christmas party.

38:35.357 --> 38:36.983
Rizzo, come on.

38:37.918 --> 38:40.089
Rizzo, just grab hold of the stick.

38:40.157 --> 38:42.329
Merry Christmas.

38:42.398 --> 38:44.307
Thank you, thank you.

38:45.726 --> 38:48.409
Excuse me, everyone.
Can we have some quiet, please?

38:48.478 --> 38:50.420
[Clucking]

38:51.229 --> 38:52.440
Whoa!

38:58.397 --> 39:00.983
I suppose I should be grateful for that.

39:01.054 --> 39:02.842
You're welcome.

39:02.910 --> 39:05.976
Everyone, please,
can I have your attention for a moment?

39:06.046 --> 39:06.994
[They laugh]

39:07.070 --> 39:10.169
Look, it's the Marley brothers.

39:10.237 --> 39:12.277
My old partners, as they were as lads.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.619
Can I have your attention, please?

39:14.685 --> 39:16.147
[Chatter continues]

39:18.174 --> 39:19.962
Quiet!

39:21.950 --> 39:23.259
Thank you.

39:23.326 --> 39:24.886
That's better.

39:24.958 --> 39:28.122
Welcome to Fozziwig and Mom's
annual Christmas party.

39:28.190 --> 39:29.978
At this time in the proceedings,

39:30.046 --> 39:32.763
it is a tradition
for me to make a little speech.

39:32.830 --> 39:35.448
And it's a tradition for us
to take a little nap.

39:35.518 --> 39:37.689
[They laugh]

39:37.757 --> 39:39.797
Uh, pay no attention to them.

39:39.869 --> 39:42.771
My speech,
here is my Christmas speech.

39:42.845 --> 39:46.260
"Thank you all
and merry Christmas."

39:46.333 --> 39:48.340
- That was the speech?
- That was dumb.

39:48.413 --> 39:50.071
- It was obvious.
- It was pointless.

39:50.141 --> 39:52.214
It was short.

39:52.286 --> 39:54.707
[Both] I loved it! [both laugh]

39:54.781 --> 39:58.872
I'm bored with speeches.
Let's dance, Son!

39:58.941 --> 40:01.308
Here's Mrs. Fozziwig to start the party.

40:01.374 --> 40:03.795
- Way to go, Ma!
- Hit it, boys!

40:03.869 --> 40:05.462
[Grunts]

40:07.613 --> 40:08.693
Hello.

40:10.237 --> 40:12.888
Look, there's a buffet over here.
I'm kind of hungry.

40:12.958 --> 40:16.307
[Sings nonsensically to <i>Deck The Halls]</i>

40:16.381 --> 40:20.757
<i>Fa-la la-la la</i>
<i>La-la la la</i>

40:20.829 --> 40:24.604
Forget it. Mother always taught me,
never eat singing food.

40:26.877 --> 40:29.212
[Fozziwig] A pleasure having you here.

40:29.278 --> 40:31.766
I'm very pleased,
and please enjoy yourself.

40:31.838 --> 40:34.259
Excuse me, Mr. Fozziwig?

40:34.333 --> 40:36.308
Sir, I've been going over the accounts.

40:36.381 --> 40:39.284
Do you know how much the firm
is spending for this party?

40:39.357 --> 40:42.521
Master Scrooge, this is Christmas.

40:42.589 --> 40:44.597
It's a time for generosity.

40:44.670 --> 40:49.939
Stop working, enjoy yourself.
Go meet some people, go ahead.

40:50.013 --> 40:51.093
Hello.

40:53.149 --> 40:55.538
[Pounding]

40:55.613 --> 40:57.522
[Growling, rapid pounding]

40:59.838 --> 41:01.561
[Band strikes up]

41:04.638 --> 41:06.492
You dancing fool!

41:13.470 --> 41:15.771
I love these annual Christmas parties.

41:15.837 --> 41:18.172
I love them so much,
I think we'll do it twice a year.

41:18.238 --> 41:19.482
Excuse me.

41:19.550 --> 41:22.233
- [Fozziwig] Master Scrooge.
- Excuse me.

41:22.301 --> 41:25.236
Belle, I'd like to introduce you
to Ebenezer Scrooge,

41:25.310 --> 41:27.611
the finest young financial mind
in the city.

41:27.678 --> 41:29.979
Ebenezer, this is Belle,

41:30.046 --> 41:31.955
a friend of the Fozziwig family.

41:32.030 --> 41:33.939
I'm pleased to meet you.

41:35.421 --> 41:38.519
Well, I'm glad you two finally met.

41:38.589 --> 41:40.859
[Spirit] Do you remember this meeting?

41:42.141 --> 41:43.799
Remember?

41:45.822 --> 41:46.770
Yes.

41:47.549 --> 41:49.491
I remember.

41:49.565 --> 41:53.460
There was, of course, another
Christmas Eve with this young woman,

41:53.533 --> 41:55.770
some years later.

41:55.837 --> 41:59.863
Oh, please,
do not show me that Christmas.

42:13.405 --> 42:15.315
[Birdsong]

42:19.965 --> 42:22.518
Another year
before our wedding, Ebenezer.

42:22.589 --> 42:24.564
It can't be helped, Belle.

42:25.693 --> 42:29.654
How could we marry now? There's
not even enough for a decent home.

42:29.725 --> 42:31.897
The investments haven't grown
as they should.

42:31.965 --> 42:33.874
So you said last year.

42:34.430 --> 42:36.535
Business continues to be poor.

42:38.173 --> 42:40.726
You're a partner in your own firm now.

42:42.333 --> 42:44.057
Barely clearing expenses.

42:44.125 --> 42:47.387
- You said the partnership was the goal.
- This is for you.

42:48.701 --> 42:51.090
I love you, Belle.

42:52.670 --> 42:54.873
You did, once.

43:00.445 --> 43:01.874
[Sobs]

43:02.685 --> 43:04.343
Oh, Rizzo.

43:08.797 --> 43:10.684
Spirit, show me no more.

43:11.614 --> 43:13.883
Why do you delight in torturing me?

43:13.949 --> 43:18.291
I told you, these are the shadows
of the things that have been.

43:18.365 --> 43:21.911
That they are what they are,
do not blame me.

43:21.981 --> 43:23.890
Leave me.

43:44.317 --> 43:48.408
Scrooge was left alone and exhausted
in his bedchamber.

43:48.477 --> 43:53.234
And thus he remained, until the
nearby clock began to strike the hour.

43:53.885 --> 43:55.259
[Grunts] Oh.

43:55.325 --> 43:58.227
- Oh. Oh, what was that?
- Two o'clock.

43:58.301 --> 44:00.636
- Is it too early for breakfast?
- Yes.

44:00.701 --> 44:03.035
Oh, good, supper time.

44:03.102 --> 44:04.531
[Ding]

44:06.365 --> 44:07.772
[Ding]

44:07.837 --> 44:11.634
[Dickens] Scrooge knew
the second of the ghosts was due.

44:11.709 --> 44:14.808
Yet now,
as the clock finished striking...

44:16.317 --> 44:17.779
Nothing.

44:19.325 --> 44:20.502
[Laughing]

44:20.573 --> 44:23.388
Come in, and know me better, man.

44:37.405 --> 44:40.024
Come in, and know me better, man.

44:40.093 --> 44:42.776
- Did I already say that?
- You did.

44:42.845 --> 44:45.528
I am the Ghost of Christmas Present.

44:45.598 --> 44:49.820
This is the night before the dawn
before the day of Christmas.

44:49.885 --> 44:53.660
Did I tell you that I am
the Ghost of Christmas Present?

44:53.725 --> 44:58.297
- You did.
- Come in, know me better, man.

44:58.365 --> 45:00.438
You're a little absent-minded, spirit.

45:00.509 --> 45:04.764
No, I'm a large
absent-minded spirit. [chuckles]

45:06.045 --> 45:08.860
My mind is filled
with the here and now.

45:08.925 --> 45:12.602
And the now is Christmas. [laughs]

45:12.669 --> 45:16.248
[Scrooge laughs] I don't believe I've
ever met anybody like you before, sir.

45:16.318 --> 45:20.474
Really? Over 1,800 of my brothers
have come before me.

45:20.541 --> 45:23.738
1,800? Lmagine the grocery bills.

45:23.805 --> 45:25.714
[Both laugh]

45:28.989 --> 45:33.113
Have you ever noticed that everything
seems wonderful at Christmas?

45:34.621 --> 45:39.225
Uh, in all honesty, spirit, no.

45:40.637 --> 45:43.452
Perhaps I've never understood
about Christmas.

45:43.517 --> 45:47.379
Before this day is done,
you will understand.

45:47.453 --> 45:49.340
Oh. [laughs]

45:49.405 --> 45:51.162
Oh, no! Oh, no!

45:53.437 --> 45:56.568
We shall go out into the world.

45:59.325 --> 46:01.626
I suppose you enjoyed that?

46:01.693 --> 46:03.154
Of course.

46:08.029 --> 46:12.404
May I welcome you
to Christmas morning?

46:12.477 --> 46:14.135
[Laughs]

46:14.781 --> 46:16.275
[They sing]

46:21.597 --> 46:24.412
<i>It's in the singing</i>

46:24.478 --> 46:26.965

48:34.749 --> 48:41.241
<i>It feels like Christmas</i>

48:44.221 --> 48:45.847
Spirit, I had no idea.

48:45.917 --> 48:49.779
I wish to see friends, kin.
Show me family.

48:51.869 --> 48:55.665
It's Fred. My dear nephew Fred
and his wife, Clara.

48:55.741 --> 48:57.596
Having Christmas with friends.

48:58.589 --> 49:00.017
Hey, look. Fruit.

49:00.093 --> 49:03.060
Well, now, we've had the plum pudding
and sung the carols.

49:03.132 --> 49:05.042
- What now, my lovelies?
- A game, Fred.

49:05.117 --> 49:07.189
Yeah, we must have a game at Christmas.

49:07.261 --> 49:10.610
- Do people play games at Christmas?
- I love games.

49:10.685 --> 49:13.238
Say, do you know that fruit is wax?

49:13.309 --> 49:16.604
Oh, yeah,
I wondered about the texture. Yeuch!

49:16.669 --> 49:19.669
- Let's play "Yes and No."
- Oh, wonderful game.

49:19.741 --> 49:22.676
Yah! That's a great game. I'll be it.

49:22.749 --> 49:25.399
Yes, let Fred be it.
He always thinks of good things.

49:25.468 --> 49:27.770
I do have a good one, Clara. Guess.

49:27.837 --> 49:29.747
Is it vegetable?

49:29.821 --> 49:31.282
- [Fred] No.
- [Clara] Mineral?

49:31.357 --> 49:32.699
- No.
- Animal, then?

49:32.765 --> 49:34.587
- What else?
- What else, indeed.

49:34.653 --> 49:36.792
- Is it found on a farm?
- Never.

49:36.861 --> 49:38.486
- In the city?
- Usually.

49:38.557 --> 49:40.695
Does it pull a hansom cab?

49:40.765 --> 49:42.227
Certainly not.

49:42.301 --> 49:43.959
How about a dog?

49:44.029 --> 49:44.977
No.

49:45.053 --> 49:46.133
- A cat?
- A cat?

49:46.205 --> 49:49.402
- I said it first.
- No.

49:49.468 --> 49:51.923
Wait, is this an unwanted creature?

49:51.996 --> 49:54.101
- Often.
- A mouse?

49:54.172 --> 49:55.350
- No.
- A rat?

49:55.421 --> 49:57.428
- You called?
- A cockroach.

49:57.500 --> 49:58.449
No.

49:58.525 --> 49:59.986
- A leech?
- It's too wonderful.

50:00.061 --> 50:02.931
Wait, I know.
An unwanted creature,

50:03.004 --> 50:05.371
but not a rat, a leech,
or a cockroach?

50:05.436 --> 50:06.451
Then what?

50:06.525 --> 50:08.762
- What?
- It's Ebenezer Scrooge.

50:08.829 --> 50:09.777
Yes.

50:09.853 --> 50:12.024
- [All laugh]
- Wonderful.

50:13.053 --> 50:15.639
[Female friend] That's a killer.

50:22.589 --> 50:25.436
Come, there is much to see.

50:25.501 --> 50:28.348
No more. I wish to see no more.

50:32.989 --> 50:34.876
Here.

50:34.940 --> 50:37.144
Why have we come
to this odd corner of the town?

50:37.212 --> 50:39.765
It's Christmas here, too, you know.

50:39.837 --> 50:42.423
That's Bob Cratchit's house.

50:42.493 --> 50:45.111
Perhaps it was the spirit's
own generous nature,

50:45.181 --> 50:47.221
and his sympathy for all poor men,

50:47.293 --> 50:51.384
that led them straight to the home
of Scrooge's faithful clerk.

50:53.245 --> 50:55.830
Goose. They're cooking goose down there.

50:55.901 --> 50:57.276
[Sniffs]

50:57.341 --> 50:59.861
Rizzo, get out of the way.

50:59.933 --> 51:02.038
Hey, don't be sweeping
the chimney now.

51:02.109 --> 51:04.051
You're blocking the smell. [sniffs]

51:05.212 --> 51:08.474
- This is Bob Cratchit's house?
- How do you know that?

51:08.540 --> 51:10.547
You just told me.

51:10.620 --> 51:13.468
Hmm. Well, I'm usually trustworthy.

51:13.533 --> 51:14.962
[Chuckles]

51:15.037 --> 51:17.492
[Woman sings inside]

51:17.565 --> 51:20.412
- Who's that?
- Mrs. Cratchit, of course.

51:20.605 --> 51:22.427
[Sings to herself]

51:23.485 --> 51:24.979
[Sniffs] Ahh!

51:27.388 --> 51:30.323
Peter, do not stop turning that spit.

51:30.397 --> 51:33.463
That is the whole secret
of a properly roasted goose.

51:33.533 --> 51:37.756
- It smells so good, Mother.
- It does, doesn't it?

51:37.821 --> 51:40.952
[Sniffs] Oh. That smells wonderful.

51:42.013 --> 51:43.387
Oh, good grief.

51:43.452 --> 51:45.492
Hey, I'm stuck, get me out of here.

51:45.565 --> 51:47.605
I knew you weren't suited
for literature.

51:48.765 --> 51:50.193
[Rizzo screams]

51:51.709 --> 51:54.043
Oh, at least I landed
on something soft.

51:54.109 --> 51:56.084
And hot! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

51:56.157 --> 51:58.360
Hot, hot, hot!

51:59.164 --> 52:01.237
Mother, Mother, Mother!

52:01.309 --> 52:06.197
You said we couldn't eat the chestnuts
until Father and Tiny Tim get home.

52:06.269 --> 52:08.276
I wasn't eating them,

52:08.349 --> 52:11.797
I was merely checking them
to see if they were not burnt.

52:11.869 --> 52:14.716
It's a chef's thing, dear.
And do not shout, Betina.

52:14.780 --> 52:17.683
- I'm Belinda.
- I'm Betina.

52:17.757 --> 52:20.026
Of course you are, Betina.

52:20.092 --> 52:21.554
Belinda.

52:22.653 --> 52:24.311
Whatever.

52:25.565 --> 52:27.899
- [Faint singing]
- Huh?

52:27.964 --> 52:29.720
[Bebop-style singing]

52:32.220 --> 52:33.169
[Cratchit scats]

52:33.245 --> 52:37.522
<i>'Tis the season</i>
<i>to be jolly and joyous, fa la la</i>

52:37.597 --> 52:42.485
<i>With a burst of pleasure</i>

<i>It's a season when the saints</i>

Come on, son.

52:56.285 --> 52:58.619
Let's go see if Christmas dinner
is ready yet.

52:58.684 --> 53:00.692
- Oh, yeah.
- Yes.

53:04.573 --> 53:06.777
Merry Christmas, everyone.

53:06.845 --> 53:07.924
Daddy!

53:11.068 --> 53:12.345
Merry Christmas, girls.

53:12.413 --> 53:14.518
- Merry Christmas, Peter.
- Merry Christmas.

53:14.589 --> 53:17.142
Children, children,
it's time to set the table.

53:17.213 --> 53:19.930
- Go ahead.
- Wait for me.

53:19.997 --> 53:23.292
- Merry Christmas, Emily.
- Merry Christmas...

53:23.356 --> 53:24.633
Crachy.

53:25.372 --> 53:26.321
Emmy.

53:30.524 --> 53:34.648
I fell down the chimney
and landed on a flaming hot goose.

53:34.716 --> 53:37.433
You have all the fun.

53:37.500 --> 53:39.443
What?

53:39.516 --> 53:42.037
Peter, the Christmas dinner.

53:42.109 --> 53:43.963
The goose, the goose.

53:44.028 --> 53:45.817
[Laughs, coughs]

53:47.292 --> 53:51.002
Oh, no, now, son,
you've gotten too excited.

53:51.069 --> 53:55.128
You go sit in your chair a moment.
Rest a moment.

53:55.197 --> 53:58.874
- How was he at church?
- As good as gold and better.

53:58.941 --> 54:01.013
He said he hoped the people
saw him in church

54:01.084 --> 54:04.467
because it might be pleasant for them
to remember upon Christmas Day

54:04.540 --> 54:08.469
who made lame beggars walk
and blind men see.

54:08.540 --> 54:10.450
A remarkable child.

54:11.869 --> 54:14.651
[Dickens] With that,
the Cratchits came to what was surely

54:14.717 --> 54:18.645
the happiest single moment
in all the livelong year.

54:18.717 --> 54:22.361
- Such a meager feast.
- But very much appreciated.

54:24.157 --> 54:26.328
I pay Bob such a small amount.

54:26.397 --> 54:28.786
- Mr. Scrooge.
- Bob.

54:28.861 --> 54:30.868
Bob Cratchit?

54:30.941 --> 54:33.788
It only seems right that
I should lift a glass to my employer.

54:33.852 --> 54:36.536
I give you Mr. Scrooge,
the founder of the feast.

54:36.604 --> 54:39.735
The founder of the feast, indeed. Huh!

54:39.804 --> 54:43.514
If I had him here, I would give him
a piece of my mind to feast upon.

54:43.580 --> 54:45.435
And I bet he would choke on it.

54:45.500 --> 54:47.867
- Choke!
- My dear, the children.

54:47.932 --> 54:49.110
Christmas Day.

54:49.181 --> 54:53.458
Well, I suppose that
on the blessed day of Christmas,

54:53.532 --> 54:57.012
one must drink to the health
of Mr. Scrooge,

54:57.084 --> 55:00.216
even though he is odious,
stingy, wicked,

55:00.285 --> 55:03.929
and unfeeling, and badly dressed...

55:03.996 --> 55:07.313
To the founder of the feast,
Mr. Scrooge.

55:07.388 --> 55:13.401
To Mr. Scrooge, he'll be very merry
and happy this day, I have no doubt.

55:13.469 --> 55:14.417
No doubt.

55:14.493 --> 55:15.737
Mm. Cheers.

55:17.213 --> 55:20.922
God bless us, every one.

55:23.037 --> 55:25.884
<i>Life is full of sweet surprises</i>

55:25.949 --> 55:28.152
<i>Every day's a gift</i>

55:28.220 --> 55:30.970
<i>The sun comes up</i>
<i>And I can feel it</i>

55:31.036 --> 55:33.557
<i>Lift my spirit</i>

55:33.629 --> 55:38.746
<i>Fills me up with laughter</i>
<i>Fills me up with song</i>

55:38.812 --> 55:41.562
<i>I look into the eyes of love</i>

55:41.629 --> 55:44.728
<i>And know that I belong</i>

55:44.797 --> 55:47.350
<i>Bless us all</i>

55:47.421 --> 55:50.071
<i>Who gather here</i>

55:50.141 --> 55:55.410
<i>The loving family I hold dear</i>

55:55.484 --> 55:58.070
<i>No place on Earth</i>

55:58.141 --> 56:00.792
<i>Compares with home</i>

56:00.860 --> 56:05.945
<i>And every path will bring me</i>
<i>back from where I roam</i>

56:06.685 --> 56:08.823
<i>Bless us all</i>

56:08.892 --> 56:11.314
<i>That as we live</i>

56:11.389 --> 56:16.986
<i>We always comfort and forgive</i>

56:17.052 --> 56:19.223
<i>We have so much</i>

56:19.292 --> 56:22.074
<i>That we can share</i>

56:22.141 --> 56:27.159
<i>With those in need</i>
<i>we see around us everywhere</i>

56:27.228 --> 56:31.385
<i>Let us always love each other</i>

56:32.636 --> 56:35.768
<i>Lead us to the light</i>

56:38.236 --> 56:43.354
<i>Let us hear the voice of reason</i>

56:43.421 --> 56:46.323
<i>Singing in the night</i>

56:48.636 --> 56:51.931
<i>Let us run from anger</i>

56:53.821 --> 56:57.683
<i>And catch us when we fall</i>

56:59.452 --> 57:04.406
<i>Teach us in our dreams</i>
<i>And please, yes, please,</i>

57:04.477 --> 57:07.673
<i>Bless us, one and all</i>

57:10.972 --> 57:13.077
<i>Bless us all</i>

57:13.148 --> 57:15.515
<i>With playful years</i>

57:15.580 --> 57:20.883
<i>With noisy games and joyful tears</i>

57:20.957 --> 57:23.739
<i>We reach for you</i>

57:23.804 --> 57:26.651
<i>And we stand tall</i>

57:26.717 --> 57:32.052
<i>And in our prayers and dreams</i>
<i>We ask you, bless us all</i>

57:32.125 --> 57:34.678
<i>We reach for you</i>

57:34.749 --> 57:38.393
<i>And we stand tall</i>

57:38.460 --> 57:42.715
<i>And in our prayers and dreams,</i>
<i>we ask you</i>

57:42.781 --> 57:46.642
<i>Bless us all</i>

57:46.716 --> 57:48.505
[coughs]

57:52.668 --> 57:55.985
[Emmy] Let's all take our seats now.
Let's have dinner.

57:56.060 --> 58:00.054
Spirit, tell me if Tiny Tim will live.

58:00.124 --> 58:02.099
That is the future.

58:02.172 --> 58:04.082
My realm is the present.

58:04.157 --> 58:09.307
However, I see a vacant seat
by the chimney corner.

58:09.372 --> 58:11.609
And a crutch without an owner.

58:11.676 --> 58:16.946
If these shadows remain unaltered,
I believe the child will die.

58:17.020 --> 58:20.337
But then, if he's going to die,
he'd better do it,

58:20.412 --> 58:23.544
and decrease the surplus population.

58:23.613 --> 58:24.954
Oh, spirit.

58:25.020 --> 58:28.020
[Dickens] As the Cratchit family
vanished into the darkness,

58:28.092 --> 58:32.183
Scrooge kept his eyes upon Tiny Tim,
until the last.

58:32.253 --> 58:35.668
Come. My time grows short.

58:35.741 --> 58:37.650
[Wind whistles]

58:42.268 --> 58:44.123
Spirit, do you grow old?

58:44.188 --> 58:46.643
I do. [chuckles]

58:48.796 --> 58:50.967
Are spirits' lives so short?

58:51.036 --> 58:53.906
My time upon this globe is very brief.

58:53.981 --> 58:59.960
I believe it will end
upon the stroke of 12.

59:00.028 --> 59:01.817
- [Ding]
- [Rizzo] One.

59:01.884 --> 59:06.456
Now? But spirit,
I have learned so much from you.

59:06.557 --> 59:09.240
Nothing Scrooge could do or say
could stop

59:09.308 --> 59:12.374
the relentless march
of those terrible bells.

59:12.444 --> 59:14.353
[Rizzo] Five!

59:14.428 --> 59:16.665
Oh, spirit, do not leave me.

59:16.732 --> 59:19.415
I think I must, in fact.

59:19.516 --> 59:22.451
You have meant so much to me.
You have changed me.

59:22.556 --> 59:27.674
And now I leave you with
the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come.

59:27.740 --> 59:31.002
- You mean, the future?
- Mm.

59:31.069 --> 59:32.083
Must I?

59:32.156 --> 59:37.688
Go forth, and know him better, man.
[Laughs]

01:00:18.396 --> 01:00:22.258
Am I in the presence of the
Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come?

01:00:25.948 --> 01:00:32.112
Spirit, I fear you more
than any specter I have yet met.

01:00:33.469 --> 01:00:36.502
This is too scary.
I don't think I want to see any more.

01:00:36.572 --> 01:00:39.703
When you're right, you're right.
You're on your own, folks.

01:00:39.772 --> 01:00:43.449
- We'll meet you at the finale.
- Yeah.

01:00:44.284 --> 01:00:48.823
I am prepared to follow and to learn,
with a thankful heart.

01:00:52.028 --> 01:00:54.395
Will you not speak to me?

01:00:58.525 --> 01:01:02.419
Oh, yes, the night is waning fast.

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:04.402
Lead on, spirit.

01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:29.398
No, I don't know much about it,
either way.

01:01:29.468 --> 01:01:32.053
I only know he's dead.

01:01:32.124 --> 01:01:35.158
- When?
- Last night, I believe.

01:01:35.228 --> 01:01:38.392
Wonder what he died of.
I thought he'd never go.

01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:39.769
[All laugh]

01:01:39.836 --> 01:01:41.941
I don't know or care why he's gone.

01:01:42.012 --> 01:01:44.347
I'd just like to know
what he's done with his money.

01:01:44.412 --> 01:01:45.873
Wouldn't we all?

01:01:45.948 --> 01:01:47.639
He didn't give it to me.

01:01:48.956 --> 01:01:51.444
It's likely to be a cheap funeral.

01:01:51.516 --> 01:01:54.233
I don't know a single soul
who would go to it.

01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:56.537
- I wouldn't mind going.
- Eh?

01:01:56.604 --> 01:01:58.743
If lunch is provided.

01:01:58.812 --> 01:02:00.851
[All snort and laugh]

01:02:00.924 --> 01:02:03.161
- Speaking of lunch...
- Oh, yes.

01:02:06.364 --> 01:02:09.047
I know some of those gentlemen, spirit.

01:02:09.117 --> 01:02:12.019
Of what poor wretch do they speak?

01:02:26.844 --> 01:02:30.706
So, back from the house of sadness,
I see.

01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:34.163
Sad that he didn't die years ago,
the old skinflint.

01:02:34.236 --> 01:02:36.276
- Hear, hear.
- Let me see.

01:02:36.349 --> 01:02:38.552
What have you got for old Joe?

01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:42.265
What have you got for me
to remember him by?

01:02:42.332 --> 01:02:44.055
Joe, get off.

01:02:44.124 --> 01:02:47.954
Well, I got these collar buttons
from his dresser.

01:02:48.988 --> 01:02:51.126
Mother of pearl.

01:02:51.196 --> 01:02:53.847
No, I got his bed curtains.

01:02:53.916 --> 01:02:56.851
Very fine damask. [laughs]

01:02:56.924 --> 01:03:00.568
Very cheap damask.
But worth a few coins.

01:03:00.636 --> 01:03:02.775
I've got his blankets.

01:03:02.844 --> 01:03:08.146
His blankets?
Why, Mrs. Dilber, they're still warm.

01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:11.668
I don't pay extra for the warmth,
you know.

01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:14.642
You should.
It's the only warmth he ever had.

01:03:14.716 --> 01:03:16.243
[All laugh]

01:03:21.724 --> 01:03:23.284
I understand, spirit.

01:03:23.356 --> 01:03:26.585
The case of this unhappy man
might be my own.

01:03:26.652 --> 01:03:29.205
My life turns that way now.

01:03:29.276 --> 01:03:31.185
Merciful heavens.

01:03:32.124 --> 01:03:35.507
Let me see some tenderness
connected with this world,

01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:38.809
or I'll be haunted
by that terrible conversation forever.

01:03:46.108 --> 01:03:48.825
It's Bob Cratchit's house.

01:03:48.892 --> 01:03:51.226
Oh, yes, spirit.

01:03:51.292 --> 01:03:53.201
A place of joy and laughter.

01:03:54.109 --> 01:03:56.530
Thank you for bringing me here.

01:04:01.852 --> 01:04:04.056
It's so quiet.

01:04:06.332 --> 01:04:08.601
Why is it so quiet, spirit?

01:04:20.444 --> 01:04:22.266
[Sniffing]

01:04:24.956 --> 01:04:26.712
Mother, you're crying again.

01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:30.075
It's just the lamplight,
that hurts my eyes.

01:04:34.428 --> 01:04:36.338
Not Tiny Tim?

01:04:37.756 --> 01:04:41.979
There, now.
My eyes get weak in the dim light.

01:04:42.044 --> 01:04:45.273
I would not want to show
weak eyes to your father,

01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:47.511
when he gets home,
for anything in the world.

01:04:47.579 --> 01:04:50.297
He should be back now.

01:04:50.364 --> 01:04:55.001
I think he's walked a little slower
these past two evenings.

01:04:56.028 --> 01:04:58.068
Hello, my dears.

01:04:58.140 --> 01:04:59.219
Daddy.

01:05:01.563 --> 01:05:03.254
Hello, girls.

01:05:03.324 --> 01:05:04.339
Hello, Peter.

01:05:04.412 --> 01:05:07.608
Children, please go set the table.

01:05:07.676 --> 01:05:09.465
Thank you.

01:05:09.532 --> 01:05:11.059
How was the churchyard?

01:05:11.132 --> 01:05:12.659
It will be lovely, Emily.

01:05:12.731 --> 01:05:16.660
It would have done you good
to see how green the place is.

01:05:16.732 --> 01:05:21.369
I picked a spot for Tim
where he can see...

01:05:21.436 --> 01:05:24.152
It's, it's a spot on the hill.

01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:26.587
You can see the ducks on the river.

01:05:26.652 --> 01:05:27.829
Tiny Tim...

01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:31.544
Tiny Tim always loved
watching the ducks on the river.

01:05:34.652 --> 01:05:39.770
Spirit, must there be a Christmas
that brings this awful scene?

01:05:41.660 --> 01:05:43.569
How can we endure it?

01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:48.471
It's all right, children.

01:05:49.628 --> 01:05:51.897
Life is made up
of meetings and partings.

01:05:51.964 --> 01:05:53.720
That is the way of it.

01:05:54.844 --> 01:05:57.844
I am sure we shall never forget
Tiny Tim.

01:05:57.916 --> 01:06:00.599
Or this first parting
that there was among us.

01:06:06.204 --> 01:06:08.277
[Quiet sniffing]

01:06:35.676 --> 01:06:37.749
Must we return to this place?

01:06:41.148 --> 01:06:43.220
There is something else
that I must know?

01:06:43.292 --> 01:06:45.713
Is that not true?

01:06:47.227 --> 01:06:50.457
Spirit, I know what I must ask.

01:06:50.524 --> 01:06:52.858
I fear to, but I must.

01:06:54.108 --> 01:06:55.701
Who was the wretched man

01:06:55.772 --> 01:06:58.521
whose death brought
so much glee and happiness to others?

01:07:11.036 --> 01:07:12.890
Answer me one more question.

01:07:12.956 --> 01:07:15.323
Are these the shadows
of things that will be?

01:07:15.388 --> 01:07:17.941
Or are they the shadows
of things that may be, only?

01:07:27.035 --> 01:07:29.272
These events can be changed.

01:07:41.116 --> 01:07:43.352
A life can be made right.

01:08:03.388 --> 01:08:05.428
Ebenezer Scrooge.

01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:08.217
Oh, please, spirit, no.

01:08:08.284 --> 01:08:10.705
Hear me, I'm not the man I was.

01:08:12.411 --> 01:08:15.608
Why would you show me this
if I was past all hope?

01:08:17.211 --> 01:08:20.986
I will honor Christmas,
and try to keep it all the year.

01:08:23.452 --> 01:08:27.674
I will live my life in the past,
the present, and the future.

01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:31.350
I will not shut out the lessons
the spirits have taught me.

01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:34.616
Tell me that I may sponge out
the writing on this stone.

01:08:37.211 --> 01:08:39.828
Spirit, please speak to me.

01:08:43.612 --> 01:08:45.368
[Clock ticks]

01:08:58.108 --> 01:08:59.701
I'm home.

01:09:03.131 --> 01:09:05.073
[Dickens]
Yes, the bedposts were his own.

01:09:05.148 --> 01:09:08.312
The bed was his own.
The room was his own.

01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:10.519
Hi, guys, we're back.

01:09:10.587 --> 01:09:12.475
We promised we would be.

01:09:12.538 --> 01:09:14.928
But the thing that made Scrooge
happiest of all

01:09:15.002 --> 01:09:16.912
was that his life lay before him.

01:09:16.988 --> 01:09:18.995
And it could be changed.

01:09:19.068 --> 01:09:22.363
I will live my life in the past,
the present, and the future.

01:09:22.428 --> 01:09:24.850
Oh, Jacob and Robert Marley.

01:09:24.924 --> 01:09:27.411
Heaven in the Christmas time
be praised for this day.

01:09:27.483 --> 01:09:29.555
I say it on my knees,
Jacob and Robert.

01:09:29.627 --> 01:09:30.837
On my knees.

01:09:30.908 --> 01:09:34.290
Oh, they're not torn down.
They're here.

01:09:34.363 --> 01:09:36.884
And I'm here. It's a miracle.

01:09:41.787 --> 01:09:44.308
I don't know what to do.
I'm as light as a feather.

01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:47.576
I'm as happy as an angel,
I'm as merry as a schoolboy.

01:09:47.643 --> 01:09:50.261
Do you think it's safe
for us to be up here?

01:09:50.331 --> 01:09:52.273
Scrooge is saved,
what can happen now?

01:09:52.346 --> 01:09:53.460
Yeah.

01:09:57.052 --> 01:09:58.873
You there, boy.

01:09:58.939 --> 01:10:00.401
What, me?

01:10:01.404 --> 01:10:03.640
Uh, that is, "What, me, sir?"

01:10:03.708 --> 01:10:05.945
- What's today?
- Pardon?

01:10:06.012 --> 01:10:07.986
What's today, my fine fellow?

01:10:08.059 --> 01:10:10.645
Today? Today is Christmas Day.

01:10:10.716 --> 01:10:12.178
It's Christmas Day?

01:10:12.251 --> 01:10:15.350
I haven't missed it.
The spirits did it all in one night.

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:18.354
They can do anything they like.
Of course they can.

01:10:18.428 --> 01:10:20.794
- Of course they can.
- Of course they can.

01:10:20.859 --> 01:10:22.616
Know the poultry shop nearby?

01:10:22.684 --> 01:10:24.953
- Yes, sir, I do.
- An intelligent lad.

01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:27.409
A remarkable lad.

01:10:27.484 --> 01:10:30.451
Do you know whether the prize turkey
has been sold in the window?

01:10:30.524 --> 01:10:33.491
The one twice as big as me?
It's still there.

01:10:33.564 --> 01:10:35.538
It's a pleasure talking with you, lad.

01:10:35.612 --> 01:10:37.946
- Go and buy it.
- Be serious.

01:10:38.012 --> 01:10:40.979
I am serious. Buy it for me
and I'll give you a shilling.

01:10:41.051 --> 01:10:43.287
No, I'll give you five shillings.

01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:46.358
Wow!

01:10:46.428 --> 01:10:49.111
And so the boy was off like a shot.
So even...

01:10:50.683 --> 01:10:52.407
Um... Sorry.

01:10:53.531 --> 01:10:55.571
I'll bring it to Bob Cratchit's house.

01:10:55.644 --> 01:10:59.353
What a surprise it'll be.
It's twice the size of Tiny Tim.

01:10:59.419 --> 01:11:02.682
And a few moments later,
dressed in his finest,

01:11:02.747 --> 01:11:05.203
Scrooge appeared
on the streets of the city

01:11:05.275 --> 01:11:08.920
to wish Merry Christmas
to all the world.

01:11:08.988 --> 01:11:10.995
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:11:11.067 --> 01:11:12.922
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:11:12.987 --> 01:11:15.191
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

01:11:16.988 --> 01:11:18.711
Gee, thanks.

01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:22.227
Everyone was out and about
this fine morning.

01:11:22.299 --> 01:11:25.529
And soon he encountered
two familiar faces.

01:11:25.596 --> 01:11:27.025
- [Yelps]
- [Gasps]

01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:28.594
Mr. Scrooge.

01:11:28.667 --> 01:11:31.155
Pardon me, gentlemen,
but about the charity donation

01:11:31.227 --> 01:11:32.950
you asked me for yesterday?

01:11:33.019 --> 01:11:34.514
Put me down for...

01:11:36.764 --> 01:11:37.843
That much?

01:11:37.915 --> 01:11:39.672
Not a penny less.

01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:42.609
A great many back payments
are included in it, I assure you.

01:11:42.684 --> 01:11:45.401
My goodness,
I don't know what to say.

01:11:45.468 --> 01:11:48.338
I just wish there was something
we could give you.

01:11:53.436 --> 01:11:55.540
A gift?

01:11:55.612 --> 01:11:57.619
A gift for me?

01:12:04.923 --> 01:12:06.385
Thank you.

01:12:07.067 --> 01:12:08.212
Thank you.

01:12:08.284 --> 01:12:12.309
- 50 times! And a Merry Christmas.
- Here's your turkey, Mr. Scrooge.

01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:14.289
Follow me, lad.

01:12:15.868 --> 01:12:18.257
<i>With a thankful heart,</i>
<i>with an endless joy</i>

01:12:18.331 --> 01:12:20.698
<i>With a growing family</i>
<i>Every girl and boy</i>

01:12:20.764 --> 01:12:23.130
<i>Will be nephew and niece to me</i>

01:12:23.196 --> 01:12:25.301
<i>Nephew and niece to me</i>

01:12:25.371 --> 01:12:28.121
<i>Will bring love, hope,</i>
<i>and peace to me</i>

01:12:28.187 --> 01:12:30.227
<i>Love, hope, and peace to me</i>

01:12:30.299 --> 01:12:32.404
<i>Yes, and every night will end</i>

01:12:32.475 --> 01:12:34.679
<i>And every day will start</i>

01:12:34.747 --> 01:12:39.482
<i>With a grateful prayer</i>
<i>and a thankful heart</i>

01:12:39.547 --> 01:12:41.936
<i>With an open smile</i>
<i>and with open doors</i>

01:12:42.011 --> 01:12:44.346
<i>I will bid you welcome</i>
<i>What is mine is yours</i>

01:12:44.412 --> 01:12:46.746
<i>With a glass raised</i>
<i>to toast your health</i>

01:12:46.811 --> 01:12:49.232
<i>With a glass raised</i>
<i>to toast your health</i>

01:12:49.308 --> 01:12:51.641
<i>And a promise to share the wealth</i>

01:12:51.708 --> 01:12:53.879
<i>A promise to share the wealth</i>

01:12:53.947 --> 01:12:56.019
<i>I will sail a friendly course</i>

01:12:56.092 --> 01:12:58.295
<i>Follow a friendly chart</i>

01:12:58.363 --> 01:13:02.520
<i>On a sea of love</i>
<i>and a thankful heart</i>

01:13:02.587 --> 01:13:04.889
<i>Life is like a journey</i>

01:13:06.971 --> 01:13:09.240
<i>Who knows when it ends?</i>

01:13:12.507 --> 01:13:14.896
<i>Yes, and if you need to know</i>

01:13:14.972 --> 01:13:17.306
<i>The measure of a man</i>

01:13:17.372 --> 01:13:21.332
<i>You simply count his friends</i>

01:13:21.404 --> 01:13:24.633
<i>Stop and look around you</i>

01:13:25.755 --> 01:13:29.268
<i>The glory that you see</i>

01:13:31.643 --> 01:13:36.182
<i>Is born again each day</i>
<i>Don't let it slip away</i>

01:13:36.251 --> 01:13:39.929
<i>How precious life can be</i>

01:14:24.091 --> 01:14:26.480
<i>With a thankful heart</i>
<i>that is wide awake</i>

01:14:26.555 --> 01:14:28.857
<i>I do make this promise,</i>
<i>every breath I take</i>

01:14:28.923 --> 01:14:31.541
<i>Will be used now to sing your praise</i>

01:14:31.611 --> 01:14:33.716
<i>Used now to sing your praise</i>

01:14:33.787 --> 01:14:36.242
<i>And to beg you to share my days</i>

01:14:36.315 --> 01:14:38.519
<i>Beg you to share my days</i>

01:14:38.587 --> 01:14:40.692
<i>With a loving guarantee</i>

01:14:40.764 --> 01:14:43.032
<i>That even if we part</i>

01:14:43.099 --> 01:14:46.482
<i>I will hold you close</i>
<i>in a thankful heart</i>

01:14:47.804 --> 01:14:52.921
<i>I will hold you close</i>
<i>in a thankful heart</i>

01:15:14.811 --> 01:15:16.818
Bob Cratchit?

01:15:19.419 --> 01:15:20.728
So, here you are.

01:15:20.795 --> 01:15:22.737
M-M-M-Mr. Scrooge.

01:15:23.099 --> 01:15:26.165
You, sir, were not at work this morning
as we had discussed.

01:15:26.235 --> 01:15:28.919
But, Mr. Scrooge, sir,
we did discuss it.

01:15:28.988 --> 01:15:31.159
It's Christmas Day.
You gave me the day off.

01:15:31.227 --> 01:15:32.274
I?

01:15:32.347 --> 01:15:34.714
I, Ebenezer Scrooge?

01:15:34.779 --> 01:15:36.568
- Would I do a thing like that?
- No.

01:15:36.635 --> 01:15:38.326
I mean, yes, but you did.

01:15:38.396 --> 01:15:40.283
Bob Cratchit, I've had my fill of this.

01:15:40.348 --> 01:15:42.998
And I have had my fill of you,
Mr. Scrooge.

01:15:43.067 --> 01:15:44.561
And therefore, Bob Cratchit...

01:15:44.635 --> 01:15:46.937
And therefore,
you can leave this house at once.

01:15:47.003 --> 01:15:49.272
And therefore,
I'm about to raise your salary.

01:15:49.339 --> 01:15:53.016
And I am about to raise you
right off the pavement...

01:15:53.083 --> 01:15:54.131
- Pardon?
- Pardon?

01:15:54.204 --> 01:15:55.611
Yes, Bob.

01:15:55.676 --> 01:15:57.269
Raise your salary.

01:15:57.340 --> 01:16:00.154
And pay your mortgage
on this house.

01:16:01.915 --> 01:16:03.737
Please, sir, come inside.

01:16:03.804 --> 01:16:05.014
Yes, yes.

01:16:05.083 --> 01:16:08.280
Bob Cratchit, would you and your family
care to join us

01:16:08.348 --> 01:16:11.828
for a little turkey dinner
on this fine Christmas Day?

01:16:11.899 --> 01:16:13.808
Merry Christmas.

01:16:23.516 --> 01:16:25.850
[Dickens] And Scrooge
was better than his word.

01:16:25.915 --> 01:16:28.533
He did it all, and infinitely more.

01:16:28.603 --> 01:16:30.426
And, er, Tiny Tim?

01:16:30.491 --> 01:16:31.985
And Tiny Tim,

01:16:32.059 --> 01:16:33.619
who did not die...

01:16:33.691 --> 01:16:35.153
Isn't that swell?

01:16:35.227 --> 01:16:38.359
To Tiny Tim,
Scrooge became a second father.

01:16:38.427 --> 01:16:40.979
He became as good a friend,
as good a master,

01:16:41.051 --> 01:16:44.662
and as good a man
as the good old city ever had.

01:16:44.731 --> 01:16:47.666
It was always said of him that
he knew how to keep Christmas well,

01:16:47.739 --> 01:16:50.008
if any man alive
possessed the knowledge.

01:16:50.076 --> 01:16:54.134
May that truly be said of us
and all of us.

01:16:54.203 --> 01:16:56.624
And so, as Tiny Tim observed...

01:16:56.699 --> 01:16:59.547
- God bless us.
- God bless us.

01:16:59.611 --> 01:17:01.269
Every one.

01:17:02.811 --> 01:17:05.943
<i>The love we found</i>

01:17:06.011 --> 01:17:09.426
<i>The love we found</i>

01:17:09.499 --> 01:17:11.920
<i>We carry with us</i>

01:17:11.995 --> 01:17:15.923
<i>So we're never quite alone</i>

01:17:16.891 --> 01:17:20.339
<i>The love we found</i>

01:17:20.411 --> 01:17:23.193
<i>The love we found</i>

01:17:24.155 --> 01:17:26.741
<i>The sweetest dream</i>

01:17:26.811 --> 01:17:30.935
<i>That we have ever known</i>

01:17:31.003 --> 01:17:33.786
Hey, say goodbye!

01:17:34.939 --> 01:17:37.721
<i>The love we found</i>

01:17:39.131 --> 01:17:41.040
Goodbye, goodbye.

01:17:41.115 --> 01:17:45.370
<i>So we're never quite alone</i>

01:17:46.267 --> 01:17:48.023
[Rizzo] Nice story, Mr. Dickens.

01:17:48.091 --> 01:17:51.223
[Dickens] Thanks. If you like this,
you should read the book.

01:17:51.290 --> 01:17:54.105
<i>It's in the singing</i>
<i>of a street corner choir</i>

01:17:54.171 --> 01:17:56.659
<i>It's going home</i>
<i>and getting warm by the fire</i>

01:17:56.732 --> 01:17:59.699
<i>It's true wherever you find love</i>

01:18:28.827 --> 01:18:31.347
<i>The message if we hear it</i>

01:18:31.419 --> 01:18:35.477
<i>Is make it last all year</i>

01:18:35.546 --> 01:18:40.882
[Ghost of Christmas Present]
Oh, Yes! Make it last all year.

01:18:40.954 --> 01:18:42.842
<i>It's in the giving of a gift</i>
