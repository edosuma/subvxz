00:01.627 --> 00:02.833
ALLISON:
Previously on Eureka...

00:02.961 --> 00:05.293
SARAH, you infected
Andy with some kind
of emotional...

00:05.422 --> 00:07.583
SARAH:
|didn't infect him,
I improved him.

00:07.716 --> 00:10.002
Andy, I really
like you.
Wow.

00:10.969 --> 00:14.757
Our goal for the selection
process has been to find the
best of the best in Eureka.

00:14.932 --> 00:17.674
What we really
want to know is,
why space?

00:18.060 --> 00:20.517
What, or who,
inspired you
to pursue it?

00:20.938 --> 00:23.600
They've made their
final selections for
the Astraeus mission

00:23.732 --> 00:25.563
and she wants me to
inform the candidates.

00:25.817 --> 00:27.148
You didn't make it, Jo.

00:27.319 --> 00:30.527
I know.
I withdrew my name
from consideration.

00:31.323 --> 00:32.278
You what?

00:32.407 --> 00:35.319
We did this together,
we should be
going together.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.154
Space isn't my dream.

00:37.371 --> 00:38.781
(CELL PHONE BEEPING)

00:41.041 --> 00:43.828
Did you?
Yeah. Did you?

00:44.920 --> 00:45.784
We made it!

00:45.921 --> 00:47.786
Congratulations,
Dr. Marten.
You earned it.

00:47.923 --> 00:48.912
Thank you, lsaac.

00:49.383 --> 00:53.376
Your selection is merely
another example of bureaucracy
rewarding mediocrity.

00:54.513 --> 00:55.798
PARRISH:
My condolences
to Titan.

00:55.931 --> 00:56.920
Whoa.

00:57.266 --> 00:59.427
(BEEPING)

01:04.022 --> 01:05.182
CARTER:
Morning, SARAH.

01:07.693 --> 01:08.682
SARAH?

01:09.820 --> 01:10.809
Morning.

01:11.029 --> 01:12.360
I think the house
took the day off.

01:12.489 --> 01:13.695
| wish I could.

01:14.491 --> 01:17.779
I'm stuck doing
security for the official
portrait of the Astraeus crew.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.288
Oh, so you'll be
with Zane.

01:21.248 --> 01:23.785
He's been giving
me the stink eye

01:23.917 --> 01:25.293
since I pulled my name
out of contention.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.705
Because he thinks
you made a mistake.
Did you?

01:27.921 --> 01:31.914
No, l was in it
for the wrong reasons.
I don't need to go to Titan.

01:32.301 --> 01:33.541
Because you're
happy here.

01:35.679 --> 01:38.921
I'm happy here.
SARAH, can I have some
coffee too, please?

01:43.562 --> 01:44.802
Well, she can't
be busy.

01:44.938 --> 01:45.927
(DOOR OPENING)

01:48.150 --> 01:49.139
Morning, folks.

01:49.568 --> 01:51.729
Oh, yes, she can.

01:51.987 --> 01:55.775
SARAH: Good morning,
Sheriff Carter, Miss Lupo.
Isn't it a beautiful day?

01:56.742 --> 01:58.198
Uh, yeah.

01:58.327 --> 02:01.911
Andy, this is the
third day this week that
you've stopped over, yeah?

02:02.289 --> 02:04.575
Neither SARAH or I
actually require sleep.

02:04.708 --> 02:06.915
We use the evening
hours to engage in, uh,

02:07.753 --> 02:08.788
intimate activities.

02:09.504 --> 02:12.712
Okay. Eventually
we're going to have to
lay down some ground rules

02:12.841 --> 02:14.001
for these sleepovers,
all right?

02:14.259 --> 02:16.875
SARAH: Will those rules
also apply to you
and Dr. Blake?

02:17.012 --> 02:20.095
Uh, no.
Because we're human
and it's my house.

02:22.893 --> 02:23.882
Oh, okay.

02:24.519 --> 02:27.431
Well, I guess I better
get ready for work then.

02:32.778 --> 02:34.063
That wasn't
very nice.

02:34.196 --> 02:37.859
Well, come on,
it's not like the toaster
has guys sleep over.

02:37.991 --> 02:38.980
(CRASHING AND WHIRRING)

02:39.534 --> 02:40.569
SARAH, what was that?

02:40.702 --> 02:43.819
SARAH: Sheriff Carter's
breakfast accidentally fell
into the garbage disposal.

02:43.955 --> 02:45.536
Oh, very mature.

02:45.666 --> 02:48.123
Miss Lupo, will you please
tell Sheriff Carter that
I'm receiving a call

02:48.251 --> 02:50.333
for police assistance
at Dr. Welke's farm.

02:50.462 --> 02:52.202
I've got ears, SARAH.
I'm right here.

02:52.339 --> 02:53.875
Dr. Welke's part
of the Astraeus crew.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.292
Did he, uh, did he
mention what happened?

02:55.842 --> 02:58.003
He's reporting that
Lenore has liquefied.

02:59.888 --> 03:00.877
Excuse me?

03:03.016 --> 03:04.847
Well, no more cowbell.

03:04.976 --> 03:06.512
I checked on her
this morning.
She was fine.

03:06.687 --> 03:07.676
(cow MOOS)

03:07.854 --> 03:10.345
Lenore was so excited
about the Titan mission.

03:12.317 --> 03:14.057
We're sending
cows to space?

03:14.986 --> 03:17.318
She's just a host
until I pack my
scabies for the trip.

03:17.989 --> 03:19.069
I'm an acarologist.

03:19.449 --> 03:21.189
Dr. Welke studies
cow mites.

03:21.326 --> 03:24.113
But I can't test
the hardiness of
xylene treated Acari

03:24.246 --> 03:26.202
in a nitrogen-methane
environment now, can I?

03:26.998 --> 03:27.987
(cow MOOS)

03:29.167 --> 03:30.543
TAGGART: All clear.

03:32.003 --> 03:32.992
Taggan?

03:33.588 --> 03:34.998
Back in town?

03:37.008 --> 03:39.920
l'm Astraeus Ground Supervisor
for Bio-Organic Experiments.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.214
Been gathering up
projects from
around the world.

03:43.807 --> 03:45.923
Just brought in
a shipment yesterday.

03:49.438 --> 03:50.723
Jackie!

03:50.856 --> 03:52.141
(BOTH LAUGHING)

03:54.693 --> 03:56.524
Jo, sweetheart,

03:56.987 --> 03:58.477
it's great to see you.

03:59.156 --> 04:01.989
I wish it were under
happier circumstances.

04:02.159 --> 04:03.865
Yeah, any idea
what happened?

04:04.119 --> 04:07.486
Don't know. I've never
seen cellular breakdown
like this in a vertebrate.

04:08.039 --> 04:09.620
Well, is there
any chance maybe
you brought a little

04:09.750 --> 04:11.490
germ hitchhiker with you
from another project?

04:11.626 --> 04:12.877
Um, possibly.

04:13.003 --> 04:14.038
Going to head
back and see...

04:14.171 --> 04:15.752
WOMAN: Here's a sample.
...if anything else
was affected.

04:15.881 --> 04:17.246
Oh, I'm sorry.
You're welcome.

04:17.716 --> 04:18.705
I could use a hand.

04:20.010 --> 04:21.591
Oh, sure.

04:23.555 --> 04:25.170
Can you take this
to Allison for analysis?

04:25.307 --> 04:28.970
Yeah, nothing says
good morning
like jar of cow.

04:29.978 --> 04:31.969
Hey, Jo, Jo,
have you...

04:33.857 --> 04:35.017
Have you
talked to him?

04:35.400 --> 04:38.267
Since 1947,
since everything's
changed,

04:38.987 --> 04:39.942
no.

04:40.071 --> 04:41.982
Any idea if you
were involved?

04:42.365 --> 04:43.354
No clue.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.155
CARTER:
What the hell
is this?

04:51.291 --> 04:53.873
Oh, well,
it must be critters
in the rafters.

04:54.002 --> 04:55.503
Oh, you think?

04:59.633 --> 05:00.748
Farms are gross.

05:11.895 --> 05:13.260
So, any luck?

05:13.605 --> 05:19.191
Um, l'm set to
one D.B. per division,
but still no signal.

05:19.653 --> 05:20.859
Well, it's a billion
miles away,

05:20.987 --> 05:22.648
so nailing the
frequency will
take some time.

05:22.823 --> 05:23.858
Well, we don't
have much time.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.776
I mean, I know it's only
a temporary camera,

05:25.909 --> 05:28.070
but the whole idea
of FTL-ing the
comm system in advance

05:28.203 --> 05:29.784
was to establish
a link before

05:29.913 --> 05:31.744
you get to Titan
with the crew.

05:32.082 --> 05:33.492
You mean my crew.

05:33.875 --> 05:34.864
Hmm?

05:35.877 --> 05:37.378
l was just named
Captain of the Astraeus.

05:40.882 --> 05:42.873
I knew you'd be
considered,
but, oh, my God.

05:43.468 --> 05:46.756
Well, it's official.
Senator Wen just called.
It's crazy, right?

05:46.888 --> 05:50.756
Well, she couldn't have
found a more qualified person,
Captain Monroe.

05:50.934 --> 05:52.299
Thank you, Ground
Commander Deacon.

05:54.771 --> 05:57.433
Excuse me,
cargo unit B-17
is at capacity.

05:57.566 --> 05:58.931
Should we move it
on to a launch pad?

05:59.067 --> 06:00.056
zeiiéirf

06:02.821 --> 06:05.107
We're still on the ground,
Ground Commander.

06:05.240 --> 06:06.480
Whatever works for you.

06:06.616 --> 06:09.403
Well, lwill inspect
the unit first and then
you can move it.

06:09.786 --> 06:10.775
Yes, sir.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.237
We'll figure
this out.
Mmm-hmm.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.494
Well, hey.

06:18.795 --> 06:22.128
Coming to you live from
the surface of Titan.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.081
(BEEPING)

06:39.065 --> 06:40.521
Want to play
doctor?

06:47.866 --> 06:48.855
Jack,

06:50.535 --> 06:52.071
that's virtual
harassment.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.994
I had a dream
that went
sort of like this.

06:55.665 --> 06:58.327
(CHUCKLES)
Oh, no. She...

06:58.460 --> 07:00.951
It's a V.R. communication
prototype for Astraeus.

07:01.087 --> 07:03.339
Separation trauma's a big
problem on long missions.

07:03.465 --> 07:05.956
Oh, I got you, I got you.
I hated sleep-away camp.

07:06.092 --> 07:08.208
But this should
help the crew feel
more bonded with home

07:08.345 --> 07:10.836
if I could get it to work
for more than a
few minutes at a time.

07:11.723 --> 07:15.932
I like our solution,
which is staying together.

07:18.605 --> 07:19.765
What is that?

07:20.482 --> 07:23.064
Oh. Um, I'll give
you a hint.

07:23.652 --> 07:26.109
What's black and white
and dead all over?

07:36.289 --> 07:39.076
Sorry, Parrish.
Official crew portrait,
no alternates.

07:39.584 --> 07:43.668
Uh, we're still
officially members
of the mission.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.124
Whatever you say.
Doug.

07:45.924 --> 07:47.880
First alternate is still
an amazing achievement.

07:48.009 --> 07:50.045
It's like you're
almost a winner.

07:50.220 --> 07:52.051
Almost.
This isn't over.

07:53.264 --> 07:54.879
Until that ship
launches,

07:56.893 --> 07:57.882
I still have a shot.

08:04.025 --> 08:06.266
Okay, people!
Group photo.

08:32.887 --> 08:36.880
So, ready to spend
a few months in space
with all these yahoos?

08:37.308 --> 08:38.889
These yahoos all
worked their asses off.

08:40.645 --> 08:42.146
Zane, l was kidding.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.892
Yeah, well, we take
this mission
very seriously.

08:47.485 --> 08:50.522
So, uh, captain, huh?
Congratulations.

08:50.905 --> 08:52.896
I guess that means
you'll be the first.

08:53.074 --> 08:54.234
The first what?

08:54.909 --> 08:56.774
The first person
to set foot on Titan.

08:56.911 --> 08:59.493
Oh, well, that honor
hasn't been determined yet.

08:59.914 --> 09:02.326
Well, in that case,
I'd like to put
my best foot fon/vard.

09:02.459 --> 09:03.915
I am the
head of G.D.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.784
You're playing the
head of G.D. card?

09:05.920 --> 09:08.627
It seems to me
that the first person
should be a woman.

09:08.757 --> 09:09.746
You're playing
the girl card?

09:09.883 --> 09:12.670
You guys got the moon,
we should get Titan.
lt's even-steven.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.758
Okay, um, I know
we're all really excited,

09:14.888 --> 09:16.594
but right now we need
to focus on the launch.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.509
So, let's get to work.
Briefing in 10.

09:18.641 --> 09:19.630
Okay.
Yeah.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.430
Well, | see why
she's the captain.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.551
Oh, yeah.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.679
COMPUTER VOICE:
FTL activated.

09:29.569 --> 09:30.934
FTL activated.

09:31.821 --> 09:32.776
Should that be
doing that?

09:32.906 --> 09:33.986
Uh, Henry,
shut it down.

09:34.115 --> 09:36.572
COMPUTER VOICE:
Ignition sequence activated.

09:37.202 --> 09:38.567
Henry,
shut it down.

09:38.703 --> 09:39.692
It won't deactivate.

09:39.871 --> 09:41.577
Ignition sequence activated.

09:41.706 --> 09:43.867
Everybody out!
Out! Everybody out!

09:44.000 --> 09:44.989
COMPUTER VOICE: Five.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.407
Fouh

09:46.920 --> 09:47.909
Three.

09:48.880 --> 09:49.869
Two.

09:50.173 --> 09:51.128
One.

09:51.257 --> 09:53.248
Boss, get out
of the way!

09:57.806 --> 09:58.795
Jack?

10:00.058 --> 10:01.047
You okay?

10:01.184 --> 10:02.890
Uh, yeah.
(GRUNTING)

10:05.271 --> 10:06.431
Where's Andy?

10:07.357 --> 10:08.346
ANDY: Hello.

10:18.910 --> 10:23.324
Hey, guys! Look at me!
Huh? I'm on Titan.

10:25.834 --> 10:27.370
There's our stuff.

10:31.881 --> 10:32.870
Ha ha!

10:47.522 --> 10:49.012
HENRY: Andy, you okay?

10:49.941 --> 10:51.556
Doing great,
Dr. Deacon.

10:52.652 --> 10:53.687
Little chilly,
though.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.519
I can feel my joint
lubricant thickening.

10:58.241 --> 11:00.197
HENRY: Don't worry, Andy.
We'll figure this out
and get you home.

11:00.326 --> 11:01.486
Hold on a minute.

11:03.663 --> 11:06.245
It's 290 degrees
below zero on Titan.

11:06.374 --> 11:08.160
There's no way he can
tolerate that for very long.

11:09.085 --> 11:10.950
Six hours.
Less.

11:11.838 --> 11:13.624
Maybe, maybe...

11:14.799 --> 11:18.417
What if we rigged
a portable FTL
drive somehow

11:18.845 --> 11:20.506
and sent it to him?

11:21.723 --> 11:23.679
With an internal
power supply,

11:23.808 --> 11:24.968
Andy could transport
himself home.

11:25.101 --> 11:26.762
Okay, I will get Zane
and Fargo started.

11:26.895 --> 11:28.931
Good, I'll run some
diagnostics and
reset the FTL.

11:29.063 --> 11:30.052
Okay.

11:41.242 --> 11:43.278
Well, there's
no tenderness
over the bone.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.281
Probably just have
some bruising.
You were lucky.

11:45.413 --> 11:46.914
Well, thanks
to Andy, yeah.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.450
How's he
holding up?

11:48.750 --> 11:51.742
Uh, first off we're trying
to get him home,
but, uh, he'll be fine.

11:52.295 --> 11:56.959
Jack, he's a billion miles
away freezing and breathing
corrosive chemicals.

11:57.926 --> 11:59.006
This time
could be different.

11:59.594 --> 12:00.583
Yeah, but...

12:02.013 --> 12:04.755
It's from Welke.
He wants answers
about his cow.

12:04.891 --> 12:05.880
Poor Lenore.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.182
(SIGHS)

12:08.311 --> 12:12.725
I haven't found any
biological pathogens.
No prions or parasites.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.724
Right now there's no evidence
that it came from
inside the animal.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.149
Then...

12:18.029 --> 12:19.018
Outside?

12:19.489 --> 12:21.571
So somebody did this
to the cow?

12:21.699 --> 12:23.030
Did the cow
have many enemies?

12:23.201 --> 12:24.281
Well, I don't...

12:26.955 --> 12:29.617
Maybe Welke did.
I mean, he has a seat
on the mission, right?

12:29.749 --> 12:31.614
Uh, who takes his place
if he can't go?

12:31.960 --> 12:32.870
An alternate.

12:36.005 --> 12:38.121
Looks like we're
going to need
another bottle, Vincent.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.749
And some more blinis,
if you don't mind.
Coming right up.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.254
Champagne?

12:42.387 --> 12:43.593
What are you
celebrating?

12:43.721 --> 12:45.552
Actually,
it's prosecco.

12:45.723 --> 12:48.385
And I am going
to Titan.

12:49.018 --> 12:50.349
Dr. Welke
had to resign.

12:50.478 --> 12:52.890
Turns out there's no point
in him going without
his experiment.

12:53.022 --> 12:54.228
What a tragedy.

12:55.024 --> 12:57.231
Would you
like a blini,
Sheriff Carter?

12:59.195 --> 13:00.901
Why would I sabotage
an experiment?

13:01.030 --> 13:02.770
It would ruin my chances
of getting on the mission.

13:02.907 --> 13:05.319
Yes, if you got caught,
which is what's happening
right now.

13:05.785 --> 13:08.868
I didn't do anything
to Welke's stupid cow,
Shenﬁ.

13:08.997 --> 13:11.739
You know how I know?
Because cows don't melt.

13:11.874 --> 13:15.583
Whoa! Whoa! Ah!

13:16.504 --> 13:18.495
How about jeeps?
Do they melt?

13:22.635 --> 13:23.670
How's the FTL?

13:23.803 --> 13:26.886
We're rigging up
cadmium air gel insulation
to protect the drive.

13:27.265 --> 13:28.300
How's Andy
holding up?

13:28.433 --> 13:30.014
You can't keep
a good deputy down.

13:30.184 --> 13:31.720
Yeah, because
he's not a quitter.

13:34.230 --> 13:37.097
Well, I'm going to help an
Australian find some slime.

13:37.483 --> 13:38.768
Let me know
if you need anything.

13:43.364 --> 13:45.980
You know it's her choice
to not go to Titan.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.024
What? I don't care.

13:50.997 --> 13:53.989
Dude, do you know how many
hours I spent coaching her
on orbital mechanics?

13:54.625 --> 13:57.207
And hydrostatics?
Then she just drops out.

13:57.795 --> 13:59.410
Leaves me...
(SIGHS)

14:00.590 --> 14:03.002
Ahem. Um,
leaves you how?

14:04.677 --> 14:06.588
Nothing.
She's a waste
of my time.

14:07.138 --> 14:09.003
Can we just get back
to trying to save Andy?

14:13.019 --> 14:15.431
Cockroaches,
not melted.

14:16.230 --> 14:18.812
Tarantulas,
not melted.

14:20.651 --> 14:23.563
Millipedes,
not melted.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.982
Uh oh, I think
this one went
the way of the cow.

14:28.993 --> 14:31.484
Oh, that one's
supposed to be goo.

14:31.996 --> 14:33.861
Plasmodial slime mold.

14:34.457 --> 14:37.119
Can't go to Titan
without your slime mold.
(CHUCKLES)

14:39.295 --> 14:41.877
So, what have you
been up to since
I saw you last?

14:42.006 --> 14:46.545
Well, you know. This and that.
Tagging ostriches
in the Sahara for a bit.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.799
And when we last
saw each other?

14:51.140 --> 14:53.722
Ah, water under
the bridge, doll.

14:56.687 --> 14:57.676
Look...

14:59.357 --> 15:02.645
I'm not going to say
it didn't sting when
you turned me down.

15:03.319 --> 15:04.934
I turned you down?

15:08.032 --> 15:08.987
My proposal.

15:11.577 --> 15:12.987
You playing
something, Jo?

15:14.372 --> 15:16.784
No, no, ljust...
I'm sorry I was...

15:16.916 --> 15:19.328
You asked me
and I turned you down.

15:22.630 --> 15:23.995
Because that's
what I do.

15:24.966 --> 15:27.002
So, uh, what's next?

15:29.470 --> 15:33.179
Mosquito larvae,
not melted.

15:33.808 --> 15:36.800
Breeding mosquitoes
for the Astraeus habitat,

15:36.936 --> 15:39.018
well, that's not going
to score you points
with the crew.

15:39.188 --> 15:41.395
Nah, these are
feeder skeeters.

15:42.024 --> 15:44.857
Sustenance for my
Eptesicus fuscus.

15:45.236 --> 15:47.022
Big brown bats.

15:47.405 --> 15:49.612
Happy in Earth's
atmosphere,

15:49.740 --> 15:52.982
but able to withstand
a high methane
environment like Titan.

15:53.494 --> 15:56.986
Genetically modified
to provide fuel
via their guano.

15:57.623 --> 15:58.703
Want to take a peek?

15:59.000 --> 16:00.865
(CHUCKLES) Now,
as appealing
as that sounds...

16:01.002 --> 16:02.833
Come on,
they're beauts.

16:11.471 --> 16:12.460
Taggan,

16:14.265 --> 16:15.254
they're gone.

16:21.189 --> 16:24.807
Firing circuits
are charged
and ready.

16:27.028 --> 16:28.939
Fargo,
we are ready.

16:29.071 --> 16:30.686
Just about
in position.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.860
Let's hope
it works this time.

16:38.581 --> 16:39.616
Hey.
Hey. Listen,

16:39.749 --> 16:41.740
we're sending
the portable FTL
drive to him now.

16:41.876 --> 16:44.618
Great. Um, what do
a cow and a jeep
have in common?

16:45.630 --> 16:46.619
What?

16:46.756 --> 16:48.621
What would cause
them both to melt?

16:49.383 --> 16:50.372
FARGO: Okay, we're ready.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.592
Uh, safety's off.

16:52.762 --> 16:53.877
A cow melted?

16:54.013 --> 16:57.005
Uh, hey, Andy?
You okay?

16:58.851 --> 17:01.012
If I had a hot cocoa,
lwouldn't complain.

17:01.979 --> 17:04.436
His skin
is starting to
vitrify in the cold.

17:06.317 --> 17:09.104
Right. Well, I'll tell you
what, when you come back,

17:09.237 --> 17:11.319
we go to Cafe Diem,
cocoa's on me.

17:12.532 --> 17:13.988
HENRY: Ready
to activate.

17:14.158 --> 17:16.444
COMPUTER VOICE:
Ignition sequence
activating.

17:17.870 --> 17:18.985
Five,

17:19.247 --> 17:20.236
four,

17:20.998 --> 17:21.987
three,

17:22.792 --> 17:23.781
two,

17:24.168 --> 17:25.157
one.

17:29.924 --> 17:30.913
What was that?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.039
Really?

17:32.301 --> 17:33.552
It didn't work,
did it?

17:34.011 --> 17:36.878
No, Jack. The blowback
destroyed it on the pad.

17:37.348 --> 17:39.964
Astronaut Andy,
ready for departure.

17:40.476 --> 17:42.762
CARTER: Henry, how are we
going to get him home?

17:44.355 --> 17:45.344
Anytime now.

17:46.023 --> 17:47.354
HENRY: I don't know
what else to do, Jack.

17:48.025 --> 17:49.981
MAN ON PA: All
emergency personnel
please report...

17:50.111 --> 17:51.146
ANDY: Guys?

17:55.283 --> 17:56.272
I'm ready.

18:02.623 --> 18:03.738
Ready to come home.

18:11.048 --> 18:14.506
TAGGART: I get why Parrish
would melt the cow,
but why me bat crates?

18:14.760 --> 18:17.376
JO: Let's ask your bats.
Are you sure we're
on the right track?

18:17.513 --> 18:19.970
I mean, we've got to
be a good mile out
from G.D. by now.

18:20.099 --> 18:23.011
Ah, they've
been here.

18:26.188 --> 18:27.177
Recently.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.478
They'd be looking
for a dark place
to roost.

18:31.652 --> 18:35.144
Every circuit
for the FTL drive
is falling offline.

18:37.158 --> 18:38.398
How did
this happen?

18:38.659 --> 18:41.822
I don't know, but I'm going to
find out before I let my crew
go up into that ship.

18:43.914 --> 18:45.165
How much longer
does Andy have?

18:45.374 --> 18:47.990
Maybe four and
a half hours.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.870
The atmosphere's already
starting to corrode
his peripheral systems.

18:53.007 --> 18:55.999
Right. If we can't
get him back, like,
worst case scenario?

18:57.011 --> 18:59.753
We just order a new
Andy and plug in
a backup disk, right?

19:00.806 --> 19:03.013
No, it doesn't
work that way.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.137
First, Andy's a prototype.

19:05.394 --> 19:08.511
Second, everything Andy's
experienced through
his emotion software

19:08.648 --> 19:11.640
builds unique pathways
in his processing core.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.186
So, he's a...

19:13.319 --> 19:14.525
A one of a kind.

19:16.864 --> 19:17.853
Right.

19:19.950 --> 19:21.611
Whoa, boys,
check this out.

19:25.373 --> 19:27.580
The circuits
are liquefying.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.332
Wait, you said
something about melting.

19:30.628 --> 19:31.663
Yeah.

19:33.130 --> 19:34.119
Lenore.

19:35.675 --> 19:36.664
And my jeep.

19:37.510 --> 19:38.750
And maybe G.D.

19:41.222 --> 19:42.211
PARRISH: Ah.

19:43.349 --> 19:44.338
How is he?

19:44.475 --> 19:49.185
Well, it's clean fracture,
but he needs to stay off
of it for six to eight weeks.

19:49.563 --> 19:50.769
Five minutes.

19:51.691 --> 19:54.979
I was a real astronaut
for five minutes.

19:55.986 --> 19:59.114
That stupid, grinning robot
gets to go to Titan
and I have to stay here.

19:59.240 --> 20:01.652
Watch it, Parrish.
My deputy is stranded

20:01.784 --> 20:03.240
on Titan and
I think you're
involved.

20:03.369 --> 20:04.654
Oh, leave me alone.

20:04.787 --> 20:07.324
Look, whatever voodoo science
you did is out of control

20:07.456 --> 20:08.992
and it messed with
Henry's FTL machine.

20:09.333 --> 20:12.871
I did not melt Lenore.

20:13.003 --> 20:14.834
I think that
he's telling
the truth.

20:16.006 --> 20:18.793
I scanned a sample
of your liquefied jeep
off his shoe.

20:18.926 --> 20:22.794
Welke's cow and
yourjeep didn't
melt, they protonated.

20:23.389 --> 20:24.344
BOTH: What?

20:24.473 --> 20:27.886
Melting is a change
in phase state.
Ice melts into liquid water.

20:28.018 --> 20:32.261
Protonation is violent.
Their subatomic components
actually ripped apart.

20:32.898 --> 20:34.980
Well, it doesn't matter
how he did it, the point
is that he did it.

20:35.109 --> 20:36.815
So he didn't melt my jeep,
he "protomated" it.

20:36.944 --> 20:38.605
Only a superacid
could do that
to yourjeep,

20:38.738 --> 20:41.480
and it would leave
fluorosulfuric traces
in Parrish's body.

20:41.615 --> 20:43.025
And there were
none in his blood test.

20:43.534 --> 20:45.195
Oh.
PARRISH: Told you.

20:45.995 --> 20:47.075
JO: Taggart...

20:47.246 --> 20:49.157
Jim, I...

20:50.124 --> 20:52.991
In case I didn't
say it before,
I'm sorry.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.785
About what happened.
Oh, don't even.

20:56.589 --> 20:59.296
No, I hope
I didn't hurt you.

21:03.471 --> 21:04.927
Well, thanks,
sweetheart.

21:06.056 --> 21:07.011
It means a lot.

21:08.434 --> 21:11.471
I'm not going to say
it didn't take me a while
to get me bearings.

21:13.773 --> 21:14.979
But then I went
on walkabout.

21:16.942 --> 21:17.931
Walkabout?

21:18.277 --> 21:20.768
Where'd you, uh...
Where'd you walk to?

21:20.988 --> 21:23.195
There is no "to."
You just go.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.072
A journey of
self discovery.

21:28.329 --> 21:29.489
You'd hate it.

21:31.165 --> 21:33.998
The point is,
when I was done

21:35.002 --> 21:36.287
I'd made me peace

21:38.380 --> 21:39.369
with us.

21:45.971 --> 21:48.553
Peace?
I'm happy. Nice.

21:55.981 --> 21:56.845
You feel that?

21:56.982 --> 21:57.971
What?

21:58.150 --> 21:59.481
That breeze.

22:00.444 --> 22:01.524
(BATS SQUEAKING)

22:01.654 --> 22:02.609
Duck!

22:02.905 --> 22:04.020
Oh! Ah! Ah!

22:07.535 --> 22:08.570
Found them.

22:13.916 --> 22:16.077
Tell Allison the sample
is from the main
circuit panel.

22:16.293 --> 22:18.158
Okay. And is the
system still melting?

22:18.295 --> 22:20.411
Well, Zane and Fargo
are trying to slow it down,

22:20.548 --> 22:23.460
but unless Allison
can determine what's
causing the protonation

22:23.634 --> 22:25.215
we can't stop
this process.

22:25.344 --> 22:26.675
She'll figure it out
and we can get him home.

22:26.804 --> 22:28.840
Jack, even if we can
replace the melted wire,

22:28.973 --> 22:32.591
we don't have a
portable FTL to
bring Andy back home.

22:32.726 --> 22:34.978
It was destroyed
and I don't know
if we can rebuild it.

22:35.104 --> 22:37.345
ANDY: Hey, boss!
Are you there?

22:37.481 --> 22:38.982
Yeah, yeah,
hey,paL
I'm right here.

22:40.192 --> 22:45.983
My sensors are detecting a
pretty severe methane storm
approaching due west.

22:47.491 --> 22:50.779
Uh, well, then you might
want to work on building
a shelter to break the wind.

22:52.454 --> 22:53.864
Will do.

22:54.582 --> 22:55.992
Even so,

22:56.500 --> 22:59.458
the methane concentration
is pretty intense.

23:00.588 --> 23:02.294
I'm bound to corrode.

23:03.048 --> 23:04.299
You've been
through worse.

23:04.842 --> 23:07.504
Right, and if anybody
can handle it, you can.

23:09.471 --> 23:10.460
ANDY: Hey, boss?

23:11.974 --> 23:12.963
Yeah?

23:14.602 --> 23:15.591
(SIGHS)

23:17.229 --> 23:18.765
I need a favor.

23:33.996 --> 23:34.985
SARAH?

23:41.503 --> 23:43.004
SARAH, um...

23:45.049 --> 23:47.415
Sorry about
this morning, but...

23:48.969 --> 23:50.300
We have to talk.

23:50.554 --> 23:52.966
SARAH: All right, Sheriff,
it's a free country.

23:57.102 --> 23:58.478
There's been
an accident.

23:58.979 --> 24:00.685
What kind of accident?

24:03.150 --> 24:04.811
Andy's stranded on Titan.

24:05.986 --> 24:08.602
That is far too harsh
an environment
for his soft skin.

24:09.239 --> 24:11.400
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
You must get him back to Earth
as soon as possible.

24:11.533 --> 24:13.034
Right, and we're doing
everything that we can.

24:15.621 --> 24:16.986

Yeah. Yeah.
You can feel emotional...

24:54.284 --> 24:58.402
No, my sensors are registering

And the 10,000 little needle
claws in me, and SARAH's
all covered in crap.

25:25.482 --> 25:27.063
It's called guano,
actually.

25:27.192 --> 25:28.853
Oh, thank you, Batman.
Where are they now?

25:28.986 --> 25:30.977
They left their smart house
through the gamma conduit,

25:31.113 --> 25:32.978
so they probably
have a roost here
in G.D.

25:33.198 --> 25:34.233
All right.
Just get them
under control.

judging from their spoor.

27:01.495 --> 27:02.655
That's disgusting.

27:03.413 --> 27:06.871
Wait, did you track them
back to Welke's farm or to
the FTL service passage?

27:07.000 --> 27:11.539
Both. They escaped on the
road near Welke's farm,
then they turned toward G.D.

how's SARAH?

28:44.973 --> 28:47.555
Well, Fargo has her hooked up
to some sort of computer
life support system,

28:47.684 --> 28:48.799
but we need
an answer fast.

28:48.936 --> 28:49.971
Well, the answer
is bats.

28:50.395 --> 28:52.010
How is a bat
going to make
something melt?

28:52.356 --> 28:55.769
Taggart genetically altered
their binary parotid glands.

28:55.984 --> 28:57.315
Why would
you do that?

28:57.444 --> 28:59.651
To create guano rich
in perchloric acid.

28:59.947 --> 29:01.778
Clean, safe fuel
for the Titan habitat.

29:01.907 --> 29:04.899
The problem is,
the guano's transforming into
some kind of super acid.

29:05.035 --> 29:07.401
A thousand times
stronger than
sulfuric acid.

29:07.579 --> 29:11.447
There has to be an activating
agent, a common element of
all the affected materials.

29:11.625 --> 29:15.994
Okay, uh, what do we got?
We've got the cow, my jeep
and the FTL jumping machine

29:16.129 --> 29:17.915
so, what do they
have in common?

29:18.131 --> 29:22.044
Let's try aminos,
phenols, xylene.

29:22.177 --> 29:25.340
Xylene. Xylene.
Um, Dr. Welke's cow fleas
were made from xylene.

29:26.014 --> 29:29.927
It's also in wire insulation,
SARAH's walls, uh, auto paint.

29:30.060 --> 29:33.723
That would explain myjeep.
My bio-containment crates
were xylene-based.

29:33.855 --> 29:34.844
So they crapped
their way out.

29:34.982 --> 29:37.348
Potential acidity factor
is off the charts.

29:37.526 --> 29:38.766
Hold, hold on,

29:39.903 --> 29:43.145

make super acid?

they were roosting.

29:49.871 --> 29:52.362

I triangulated
all the melting sites,

29:52.541 --> 29:54.782

is right here.

full of methyl iodide gas.

If you like the
atmosphere on Titan.
Which they do.

30:07.973 --> 30:10.635
Okay, to neutralize
the super acid
and stop the melting,

30:10.767 --> 30:14.851
I'm going to need an enzyme
sample from the binary parotid
gland of one of those bats.

30:14.980 --> 30:16.516

have to go inside.

talking about?

30:38.962 --> 30:40.953
"Sorry." Because I never
heard you say it before.

30:41.214 --> 30:44.342
Zane, leaving the
mission was the right
decision for me.

30:44.468 --> 30:47.756
I shouldn't have to
apologize because
it's not about you.

30:47.929 --> 30:49.885
Then maybe you
should have clarified that
before I got involved.

30:50.015 --> 30:52.882
It was your idea.
You were the one
that told me to try.

30:53.018 --> 30:55.009

wanted to go the distance

30:55.145 --> 30:56.976

just playing around.

30:58.357 --> 31:04.068
Fine, fine. I am sorry
for not knowing exactly
what I wanted. Hmm?

out of here.

31:44.027 --> 31:48.566
Unfortunately,
the colony of brown bats
is normally 85% male.

31:48.949 --> 31:51.907
Of course it is.
And the difference between
the boys and the girls is...

31:52.285 --> 31:54.321

we've improvised
an FTL slingshot

of grabbing Andy
back from Titan.

He has to be at the exact
coordinates where he arrived
when that wormhole opens.

Now we've lost the comm feed
so there's no way for us to
tell him where he needs to be.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.351
Maybe we could show him.

Hey. Come on.

36:42.951 --> 36:45.442
CARTER: Hey, partner.
How's it going?

36:47.455 --> 36:48.444
Andy?

36:52.127 --> 36:53.287
Hey.

36:57.966 --> 36:59.547
Are you an angel?

37:01.094 --> 37:02.379
Not even close!

37:02.512 --> 37:06.881
Allison gave me a
holo-communicator thing she's
been testing for the mission.

37:07.058 --> 37:09.925
Look, right now, we got to
get you back to the place
where you zapped in.

37:10.812 --> 37:12.803
I don't know
ifl can make it, boss.

37:13.648 --> 37:15.309
Just try, buddy.

37:15.942 --> 37:17.933
What's a sheriff
without a deputy, huh?

37:24.409 --> 37:27.526
The FTL extraction
point is just ahead.
It should be a piece of cake.

37:28.246 --> 37:30.077
Easy for the
hologram to say.

37:31.082 --> 37:33.038
Come on, buddy,
all right?

37:33.293 --> 37:34.578
SARAH needs
you home safe.

37:41.634 --> 37:42.623
Wow.

37:46.473 --> 37:48.555
Well, there's something
you don't see every day.

37:53.563 --> 37:55.804
Andy, you got to reach
that boulder right over there.

37:55.940 --> 37:58.352
As soon as you're there,
Henry's going to try
to pull you back, okay?

37:59.360 --> 38:00.395
Try?

38:00.945 --> 38:03.277
Just hurry!
We're losing signals!

38:03.656 --> 38:04.645
Okay.

38:08.787 --> 38:10.448
I lost the signal.
He was a few steps away.

38:10.580 --> 38:11.695
Stand by.

38:11.831 --> 38:13.446
(MACHINE POWERING UP)

38:23.259 --> 38:24.248
Yeah!

38:27.639 --> 38:28.754
Hey!

38:28.890 --> 38:32.428
Oh. Thanks for
bringing me back, boss.

38:33.228 --> 38:34.764
I'd say we're even.

38:36.356 --> 38:37.812
Okay.
Okay.

38:52.664 --> 38:54.325
Hey. How's Andy?

38:55.667 --> 38:57.407
Defrosti ng,
but he'll recover.

38:57.669 --> 38:59.955
Yeah, he's tough.
Could I?

39:02.131 --> 39:03.120
Sure.

39:11.933 --> 39:12.888
What's up?

39:13.017 --> 39:15.884
Just, just give me
a sec. Okay?

39:17.856 --> 39:19.016
You know, this mission
is a big deal.
Oh!

39:19.148 --> 39:21.525
I know.
It's history.

39:22.902 --> 39:23.982
It's just,
when I thought
about doing it

39:24.112 --> 39:25.727
I always thought about
doing it with you.

39:27.031 --> 39:28.020
(SIGHS)

39:28.783 --> 39:32.367
I am sorry
ifl let you down.

39:37.208 --> 39:38.744
Less crappy apology?

39:39.168 --> 39:40.328
Yeah, a little.

39:42.255 --> 39:44.041
So for the record,
what is this?

39:44.382 --> 39:45.462
You and me?

39:47.594 --> 39:48.583
Yeah?

39:48.928 --> 39:52.386
I think it's more than
we ever were before.

39:52.599 --> 39:53.930
I got that, but, but...

39:55.143 --> 39:57.384
But that's not what
you're asking me, is it?

40:00.481 --> 40:01.937
You want to know
if I'll wait for you.

40:03.026 --> 40:04.015
VVHlyou?

40:05.069 --> 40:06.149
I don't know.

40:06.279 --> 40:07.689
Because you don't know
how you feel about me?

40:07.822 --> 40:09.153
No, no, because I...

40:10.909 --> 40:13.776
I don't know how I feel
about a lot of things.

40:14.245 --> 40:16.577
And I am trying
to figure it out.

40:18.374 --> 40:22.208
| just can't
make that kind of
a promise until I do.

40:23.755 --> 40:25.245
Okay.
Okay?

40:28.718 --> 40:29.707
Honesty.

40:31.387 --> 40:32.923
I never thought
we'd get here.

40:36.434 --> 40:38.299
I guess you never know
where the day will take you.

40:40.188 --> 40:41.223
Yeah.

40:43.399 --> 40:45.014
CARTER: Fargo,
you there?

40:45.193 --> 40:48.811
Yep! Well, we stopped
the melting and replaced
the damaged components.

40:48.947 --> 40:51.029
All that's left now
is to bring her
back online.

40:51.157 --> 40:52.567
Did you recover
her memory files?

40:53.076 --> 40:55.783
Unfortunately they were
corrupted during the melting.

40:55.954 --> 40:57.945
Some of her data
was permanently lost.

40:58.206 --> 41:00.948
Well, let's hope
that's just the stuff
on my cholesterol.

41:01.960 --> 41:03.496
Well, we're about
to find out.

41:05.338 --> 41:07.044
(SARAH POWERING UP)

41:11.427 --> 41:13.918
SARAH, you there?

41:17.850 --> 41:19.806
SARAH: Yes, Dr. Fargo,
how are you?

41:19.936 --> 41:22.427
I'm fine.
It's good to hear my...
Your voice.

41:22.689 --> 41:25.601
Hey, SARAH. Uh, you had us
worried there for a second.

41:26.859 --> 41:28.520
Worried about what,
Shedﬁ?

41:30.947 --> 41:32.733
Uh.
Nothing.

41:32.949 --> 41:37.067
I have someone here for you.
Someone who's pretty
anxious to talk to you.

41:42.500 --> 41:43.489
Hi, honey.

41:44.961 --> 41:45.950
I'm home.

41:48.673 --> 41:50.914
SARAH?
Everything okay?

41:52.010 --> 41:52.999
I'm sorry.

41:54.846 --> 41:57.212
I forget sometimes
that you can't see me smile.

41:59.183 --> 42:00.923
I was afraid
I'd lost you, baby.

42:01.102 --> 42:04.390
Take more than
a titanic methane storm
to keep me from my gal.

42:04.939 --> 42:09.228
Come get warm.
It's 290 degrees
below zero on Titan.

42:09.569 --> 42:10.809
So I discovered.

42:12.947 --> 42:13.936
Thank you.

42:20.955 --> 42:21.944
I try not to
think about it.

42:22.081 --> 42:24.538
Yeah. Well, I guess
my work here is done.

42:26.377 --> 42:27.913
You did
a greatjob.
Thanks.

42:28.046 --> 42:29.161
All in a
day's work.

42:30.548 --> 42:32.914
So I guess you're
going to have another
house guest for a while.

42:33.301 --> 42:35.041
Yeah. Seems that way.

42:35.178 --> 42:37.169
It's okay.
Doesn't feel
so crowded.

42:37.513 --> 42:39.925
Oh, Jo wasn't enough?
You want Andy too?

42:43.519 --> 42:46.761
Well, I want you.

42:48.941 --> 42:51.933
Think a house
isn't a home
unless you share it

42:52.361 --> 42:53.942
with the person
that you love.

42:55.198 --> 42:58.531
You realize I come as
a package deal with
Kevin and Jenna, right?

42:59.160 --> 43:00.946
Really? No.

43:02.038 --> 43:03.027
Yeah.

43:03.414 --> 43:04.403
Yeah.

43:05.291 --> 43:06.952
Living together, huh?

43:07.668 --> 43:08.657
Just think about it.

43:10.004 --> 43:10.914
Okay?
