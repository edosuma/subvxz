<i>As a doctor,
you need to be prepared for anything:</i>

00:04.630 --> 00:07.341
<i>Heart attacks,
drug overdoses, gunshot wounds.</i>

00:07.424 --> 00:09.551
<i>But one thing you can't prepare for</i>

00:09.635 --> 00:13.472
<i>is what happens
after you break up with a co-worker.</i>

00:13.555 --> 00:17.017
- Watch where you're walking!
- You watch where you're walking.

00:17.100 --> 00:18.852
<i>Get the last word in.</i>

00:18.936 --> 00:23.941
- You watch where you're walking!
- You watch where you're walking!

00:24.024 --> 00:28.862
<i>Try as hard as you can to avoid them,
you're bound to run into 'em one day.</i>

00:33.075 --> 00:35.160
<i>And the next day.</i>

00:37.996 --> 00:40.082
<i>And the next day.</i>

00:41.500 --> 00:46.588
- You don't even play sports.
- This helps me to relieve stress!

00:49.049 --> 00:50.551
Feel better?

00:53.887 --> 00:55.722
l do now.

00:58.141 --> 01:00.227
- Girl problems?
- How'd you know?

01:00.310 --> 01:03.272
You look like you got problems.
You're a girl.

01:03.355 --> 01:05.816
Hence, girl problems.
Watch your nails.

01:05.899 --> 01:09.361
<i>The only positive is that
a hospital's like one big family.</i>

01:09.444 --> 01:13.574
<i>So if one relationship ends,
there are others around you can rely on.</i>

01:13.657 --> 01:17.703
- Dr Cox, l was wondering...
- l'd say you're about a B-cup.

01:19.496 --> 01:21.957
At least they're real.

01:22.040 --> 01:24.585
<i>Yep, it's a good place to heal.</i>

Look, Mom, l gotta go.

01:46.481 --> 01:48.567
He did?

01:51.320 --> 01:54.448
Yeah. All right. l love you too. Bye.

01:56.366 --> 01:59.328
My high school teacher,
Mr Peters, died.

02:01.830 --> 02:04.333
- Was a great guy.
- You OK?

02:04.416 --> 02:06.752
<i>Even though I see death
all the time now,</i>

02:06.835 --> 02:09.338
<i>I still react the same way
as when I was a kid.</i>

02:09.420 --> 02:12.174
Doin' a lot better than Mr Peters.

02:12.257 --> 02:14.343
- Dude.
- What's up, newbie?

02:14.426 --> 02:17.346
My favourite
high school teacher just died.

02:17.429 --> 02:20.641
The correct answer is, ''Nothing, sir''.

02:20.724 --> 02:25.270
My God. Would you look at this hellhole?

02:25.354 --> 02:27.856
lf l see more broken-down equipment,

02:27.940 --> 02:32.486
one more gomer shuffled back and forth
between some godforsaken home,

02:32.569 --> 02:35.072
one more patient denied treatment

02:35.155 --> 02:37.866
because they got
the wrong insurance, l...

02:38.867 --> 02:42.496
There are times when
l concentrate as hard as l can

02:42.579 --> 02:45.749
to see if l can
catch on fire like the Human Torch.

02:45.833 --> 02:48.794
And mark my words, newbie,
if l ever pull it off,

02:48.877 --> 02:51.588
l will be back here
to destroy this place.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.841
l used to like the Silver Surfer.

02:53.924 --> 02:56.218
- Hang ten! Hang...
- Get in here.

02:56.301 --> 02:59.054
<i>After a while
you get used to Dr Cox's rants.</i>

02:59.137 --> 03:01.807
And the lab tech
is nowhere to be found,

03:01.890 --> 03:05.060
so l can't get that
tox screen l was looking for.

03:05.143 --> 03:07.938
What do you say we write him
a friendly note?

03:08.021 --> 03:09.690
''Dear

03:09.773 --> 03:11.400
incompetent

03:11.483 --> 03:13.235
dumb-ass.''

03:15.112 --> 03:19.533
<i>The truth is, Dr Cox isn't really
angry, he's just amusing himself.</i>

03:21.493 --> 03:23.871
<i>Maybe he's a little angry.</i>

03:26.832 --> 03:29.209
We didn't need those.

03:29.293 --> 03:31.336
So, all done?

03:39.261 --> 03:42.014
He broke his pencil.

03:45.475 --> 03:48.812
Turk, you'll be happy
you picked me to co-write this study.

03:48.896 --> 03:53.066
Hell, yeah. l thought we'd start off
by having a couple of beers.

03:53.150 --> 03:56.278
l got all the info
on peripheral vascular disease,

03:56.361 --> 03:58.780
highlighted passages and coded them

03:58.864 --> 04:01.575
to correspond with
the outline in your packet.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.827
But l don't have a packet.

04:03.911 --> 04:05.996
Look at that. Turk's packet.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.457
- So you did this last night?
- Yeah.

04:08.540 --> 04:13.128
- Why? What'd you do?
- Carla had to work, so l scarfed down

04:13.212 --> 04:16.339
a bunch of fast food
and got back home at around seven.

04:16.423 --> 04:20.844
Then l went to the bathroom at eight.
l got outta there at 1 1 .1 5.

04:20.928 --> 04:23.096
lt was a good night!

04:23.972 --> 04:26.600
l'm a nervous poo-er.

04:26.683 --> 04:29.311
You are not gonna
believe what Dr Cox...

04:30.479 --> 04:33.815
- lt's you.
- Yeah. lt's me.

04:33.899 --> 04:38.445
<i>Could Turk have picked anyone
worse to be doing this project with?</i>

04:38.529 --> 04:42.282
lf this is a peripheral vascular
disease study,

04:42.366 --> 04:47.371
then l'd exclude all claudication
patients not on pentoxifylline.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.998
What're you lookin' at?

04:50.791 --> 04:52.876
l'm gonna go to bed.

04:54.753 --> 04:58.173
Elliot, are you gonna go with him?

04:58.257 --> 05:01.468
Too early for jokes?
That's good to know.

05:01.552 --> 05:03.929
lt's good to know.

05:06.974 --> 05:10.227
lnteresting. lt isn't often
l'm paged by a nurse.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.938
The last time was when...

05:13.021 --> 05:16.149
What was her name?
She hasn't worked here since.

05:16.233 --> 05:19.278
Never mind. What can l do
for you and your coma patient?

05:19.361 --> 05:21.989
l came across
Mr Rice's advance directive,

05:22.072 --> 05:25.033
and he has a few requests
he would like us to honour.

05:25.117 --> 05:27.452
Let's see.
Blinds open? That's done.

05:27.536 --> 05:29.621
lncense burning?

05:32.583 --> 05:35.127
Close enough. Glad you called.

05:35.210 --> 05:40.507
<i>Dr Kelso, he also wants to hear
Poison's Talk Dirty to Me once a day.</i>

05:40.591 --> 05:43.302
He wants to hear whose what?

05:43.385 --> 05:45.470
Poison.
lt's a heavy metal band.

05:45.554 --> 05:48.182
Like Mötley Crüe and Winger.

05:48.265 --> 05:50.350
My son was a bit of a headbanger.

05:50.434 --> 05:54.479
- l'll get a tape deck in here...
- Nurse Espinosa, that's not necessary.

05:54.563 --> 05:58.442
- lt's just one song.
- lt starts out as just one song.

05:58.525 --> 06:01.445
But then half of the hospital staff

06:01.528 --> 06:06.241
is piercing their genitalia
and fornicating in the back of vans.

06:06.325 --> 06:09.578
Unless a family member
enforces the directive,

06:09.661 --> 06:11.747
we don't have to do anything.

06:11.830 --> 06:14.208
Now, will you do me a favour

06:14.291 --> 06:17.377
and just forget about it,
sweetheart?

06:18.504 --> 06:20.297
Of course.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.592
Can you help me
locate one of his family members?

06:23.675 --> 06:28.388
l could try to locate one through some
legal channels, but l'm really swamped.

06:28.472 --> 06:31.099
l love your worry lines.
They're adorable.

06:31.183 --> 06:34.311
They're like sexy
little forehead smiles.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.855
Careful, l've been hurt before.

06:36.939 --> 06:39.733
You won't believe
what happened yesterday.

06:39.816 --> 06:43.862
Dr Cox went ballistic
and destroyed an entire lab room.

06:43.946 --> 06:48.867
Broken computers, chairs
through windows, shattered beakers.

06:48.951 --> 06:51.954
Beakers.
How is this is not good gossip?

06:52.037 --> 06:55.207
JD, he does this every year.
And whatever you do,

06:55.290 --> 06:59.044
don't get caught in his wake,
because he'll take you down.

06:59.127 --> 07:01.547
Downtown.

07:01.630 --> 07:03.632
All the way?

07:08.512 --> 07:10.931
lt's OK, boy. Who is it?

07:14.268 --> 07:19.898
Little piggy, open up this door
or l will start huffing and puffing.

07:19.982 --> 07:23.026
But, Dr Cox, l... OK!

07:27.865 --> 07:30.576
Dear Lord,
please tell me that's not a onesie.

07:30.659 --> 07:32.452
l'd invite you in...

07:32.536 --> 07:35.330
<i>- l've no interest in coming in.
- Thank God.</i>

07:35.414 --> 07:37.666
We're goin' out.

07:38.500 --> 07:41.628
We can finish
the synopsis for chapter four,

07:41.712 --> 07:44.882
and process the Stegemann data
if we pull an all-nighter.

07:44.965 --> 07:49.052
- This isn't due for another month.
- But if we finish one week early,

07:49.136 --> 07:51.388
we can play with fonts and margins.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.891
Look...

07:53.974 --> 07:58.187
Tonight's date night with Carla,
and l got on special underwear.

07:58.270 --> 07:59.354
Go.

08:00.606 --> 08:03.192
Would you mind if l keep working?

08:03.275 --> 08:05.360
Yeah, that works for me.

08:07.863 --> 08:12.159
l'm wearing special underwear too.
They're invisible.

08:12.242 --> 08:14.369
Todd, l'm just kinda busy here.

08:14.453 --> 08:16.580
No time for the Todd.

08:16.663 --> 08:20.042
All the project geeks
are busy working tonight.

08:20.125 --> 08:21.793
Excuse me?

08:21.877 --> 08:25.214
All the surgical interns
picked a project geek from Medical

08:25.297 --> 08:28.509
- to write our reports for us.
- l'm not a geek.

08:28.592 --> 08:31.136
What's that on your finger?

08:31.220 --> 08:34.097
lt's a rubber thingy
to help me turn the pages...

08:34.181 --> 08:36.265
...quicker.

08:37.934 --> 08:40.312
She said ''rubber thingy''.

08:41.980 --> 08:45.108
Excuse me, nurse.
l'm ready for my sponge bath.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.402
l'm sorry, l can't.

08:47.486 --> 08:49.863
l gotta pick up a CD
for this coma patient.

08:49.947 --> 08:52.908
- But l'm wearing silk boxers.
- Turk...

08:52.991 --> 08:55.619
The ones with the dogs
holding big money bags.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.913
Sweetie, l love your money pants.

08:57.996 --> 09:01.500
lt's just that l feel somebody
needs to take care of this guy.

09:01.583 --> 09:04.920
How is it that you can blow me off
and it makes you sexier?

09:05.003 --> 09:07.881
- Cos you're whipped.
- l thought so.

09:07.965 --> 09:09.925
Thank you.

09:13.846 --> 09:16.139
Minty.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.934
So we're here.
What do you wanna talk about?

09:19.017 --> 09:22.187
lf you don't toss that shot back,
l'm gonna throw you

09:22.271 --> 09:26.358
<i>up on the bar and make you sing
the theme song from Endless Love.</i>

09:30.863 --> 09:32.614
- Yucky.
- Yucky?

09:34.032 --> 09:36.952
l'm drinking with a mouseketeer.

09:37.035 --> 09:38.620
Two more.

09:38.704 --> 09:43.208
lf you're not gonna talk to me, what's
the point of sitting alone in a bar?

09:43.292 --> 09:46.628
You know,
that's a good point. lt is.

09:47.963 --> 09:52.634
Excuse me, ladies. Do you know anybody
who might like a couple of free drinks?

09:56.471 --> 09:58.557
Hello, ladies.

10:02.644 --> 10:05.772
Yes, it's a onesie.

10:05.856 --> 10:08.192
Great news. l'm back for the night.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.152
You know what?

10:10.986 --> 10:13.280
The hell with you, Chris Turk.

10:14.573 --> 10:16.658
What the hell got into her?

10:16.742 --> 10:21.163
Wassup!

10:32.216 --> 10:34.092
Could you turn that off, please?

10:34.176 --> 10:37.054
What?

10:37.137 --> 10:41.975
l thought l told you not to play
that in the house... Hospital.

10:42.059 --> 10:44.520
l'm just trying
to do right by my patient.

10:44.603 --> 10:47.523
As of this moment,
he is no longer your patient.

10:47.606 --> 10:49.608
- Dr Kelso, you...
- Young lady,

10:49.691 --> 10:53.737
when l asked you to leave it alone,
l wasn't really asking you.

10:53.820 --> 10:57.741
lt's like when l ask the paperboy
to avoid hitting my rosebushes.

10:57.824 --> 11:00.869
l'm saying you damn well better do it

11:00.953 --> 11:04.081
or l'm going to forget
to put the chain on Baxter.

11:04.164 --> 11:08.085
Now get on out of here
and take that boom blaster with you!

11:09.545 --> 11:14.091
My relationship with Jeremy was
emotionally over before he ended it.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.927
Then l graduated from college
and met Ethan.

11:17.010 --> 11:20.097
You don't say?

11:20.180 --> 11:23.725
We had two good years
and two bad years, but not all at once.

11:23.809 --> 11:25.686
Of course.

11:27.271 --> 11:31.108
Dr Cox, don't get me wrong.

11:31.191 --> 11:34.778
Love getting drunk in my jammies
just as much as the next guy,

11:34.862 --> 11:36.989
but it's late, so...

11:37.072 --> 11:39.783
Thanks for coming out, newbie.

11:39.867 --> 11:42.786
Hope this whole thing
wasn't too yucky for you.

11:42.870 --> 11:45.747
You seem fine, so l'm...

11:45.831 --> 11:48.625
l am not fine.

11:48.709 --> 11:53.130
Why do you think we're out
here at this bar at two in the morning?

11:53.213 --> 11:56.133
Just so we can go in the urinal
and piss on the ice?

11:56.216 --> 11:58.385
l love to melt the middle.

11:58.468 --> 12:01.430
We're out here because
if l go home and go to sleep,

12:01.513 --> 12:06.476
the only thing l'll be able to think
about is l gotta go back to that place.

12:06.560 --> 12:09.354
And you wanna know something?

12:09.438 --> 12:11.648
l got nothing.

12:11.732 --> 12:14.985
Honest to God,
l got nothing. l'm cooked.

12:24.203 --> 12:26.705
You owe me $53.

12:29.082 --> 12:32.711
l think l left my wallet
in my other onesie.

12:38.217 --> 12:40.677
The bartender
let you skip out on the tab?

12:40.761 --> 12:43.722
He said l could pay him back
by giving him a physical,

12:43.805 --> 12:46.683
which is scary because
l never said l was a doctor.

12:46.767 --> 12:49.728
l warned you about
getting caught up in Dr Cox's wake.

12:49.811 --> 12:52.523
- Does he listen?
- You'd think so with those ears.

12:52.606 --> 12:54.650
Uncalled for.

12:54.733 --> 12:57.152
lt's different.
He showed up at my place.

12:57.236 --> 12:58.570
He showed up at my house.

12:58.654 --> 13:02.491
- Showed up at my mama's.
- Ruined my wedding.

13:02.574 --> 13:05.410
l know you think
he's gonna shake this off,

13:05.494 --> 13:08.664
but l connected with the guy,
and there is no way

13:08.747 --> 13:11.083
he'll walk in with a big smile.

13:11.166 --> 13:16.380
What do you say, sports fans?
lt's a great day!

13:21.718 --> 13:24.555
Elliot, Todd has
something to say to you.

13:24.638 --> 13:26.223
Todd?

13:26.306 --> 13:29.852
Turk never told me
you were his project geek.

13:29.935 --> 13:33.272
- And?
- You look really hot eating that egg.

13:34.815 --> 13:36.900
l'm sorry.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.320
- OK? Are we?
- No.

13:43.574 --> 13:45.868
Look at me and tell me l'm not a geek.

13:45.951 --> 13:50.873
- You still got that rubber thingy on.
- Eggs can be extremely slippery.

13:54.710 --> 13:56.795
You scared the hell outta me.

13:56.879 --> 13:58.964
l'm sorry. That always happens.

13:59.047 --> 14:01.592
No one ever expects
me to be anywhere.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.677
Aw, Ted.

14:05.262 --> 14:07.514
She knows your name.

14:07.598 --> 14:12.019
So, l found your coma patient's
relative you were looking for.

14:12.102 --> 14:15.647
Thank you!
Thank you so much.

14:15.731 --> 14:17.316
Don't let go.

14:17.399 --> 14:19.902
- What?
- Nothing.

14:19.985 --> 14:24.114
l'll acknowledge there
have been occasions during my tenure...

14:24.198 --> 14:26.283
What do you think you're doing?

14:26.366 --> 14:30.245
Apologising to Franklyn
for breaking his favourite microscope.

14:30.329 --> 14:34.082
You can't cry on my shoulder
then pretend nothing happened.

14:34.166 --> 14:37.544
All right. First of all,
Franklyn, there was no crying.

14:37.628 --> 14:39.213
Say it.

14:39.296 --> 14:41.131
- No crying.
- Good boy.

14:41.215 --> 14:43.675
And you should give some thought

14:43.759 --> 14:46.261
to purchasing some
non-bunching panties.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.388
They give you the extra support

14:48.472 --> 14:52.059
while protecting against those lines
underneath your scrubs.

14:52.142 --> 14:55.062
- l get it. l'm a girl.
- Franklyn, you heard it. Say it.

14:55.145 --> 14:57.147
- He's a girl.
- Good boy.

14:57.231 --> 15:00.692
You can't play with people's
emotions cos you feel like it.

15:00.776 --> 15:03.862
OK, newbie, l'm now going
to give you an opportunity

15:03.946 --> 15:06.865
to get out of here
before l grab you by your ankles

15:06.949 --> 15:09.368
and redecorate Franklyn's lab.

15:09.451 --> 15:11.620
Please go.

15:13.539 --> 15:16.041
We're back.
The clique is back together!

15:16.124 --> 15:19.962
That is what
l'm talkin' about. Shall we?

15:20.045 --> 15:22.130
Let's do this.

15:31.139 --> 15:33.642
Let's get back to work.

15:33.725 --> 15:36.353
But it's gonna be different this time.

15:36.436 --> 15:40.482
lf we take a systematic approach,
we'll maximise our efficiency.

15:40.566 --> 15:42.568
<i>l rented Red Dawn.</i>

15:42.651 --> 15:44.486
Wolverines!

15:44.570 --> 15:47.656
Dr Kelso, this is Matthew Rice.

15:47.739 --> 15:50.826
He's the proxy
for his uncle's living will.

15:50.909 --> 15:52.870
What a happy coincidence,

15:52.953 --> 15:56.373
you showing up
out of the clear blue sky.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.625
- Oh, God.
- You're OK.

15:58.709 --> 16:02.087
So, exactly how much is my uncle
leaving me? Can l ask that?

16:02.171 --> 16:04.506
This isn't about his assets.

16:04.590 --> 16:07.551
This is about executing
his last living requests.

16:07.634 --> 16:10.137
So no money at all?

16:10.220 --> 16:12.556
Not a dime, kiddo.

16:12.639 --> 16:15.392
l can't tell you how glad we are

16:15.475 --> 16:17.853
to put all this tomfoolery to rest.

16:17.936 --> 16:21.148
Once and for all.
Cup of coffee, sport?

16:24.776 --> 16:26.987
What happened? l blacked out.

16:28.655 --> 16:32.409
When you rolled out of bed this morning,
did you say to yourself,

16:32.492 --> 16:37.206
''Hey! l think today would be
a terrific day to commit hari-kari''?

16:37.289 --> 16:39.374
That's what you're doing.

16:39.458 --> 16:42.961
You don't deal with problems
the way emotionally healthy people do.

16:43.045 --> 16:45.464
Well, hold on
a second there, Rainbow.

16:45.547 --> 16:49.009
This just off the news wire:
You're not licensed to comment

16:49.092 --> 16:51.386
on how people deal with their emotions.

16:51.470 --> 16:55.224
- l beg to differ.
- Well, at least l let mine go. You?

16:55.307 --> 16:57.893
lf you ever were able to actually

16:57.976 --> 17:01.271
release all the tensions
that are bottled up inside of you,

17:01.355 --> 17:04.066
what would that look like?
How would that go?

17:08.194 --> 17:11.198
How you like me now, bitch?

17:11.281 --> 17:14.785
Maybe l just don't
have anything bottled up.

17:16.578 --> 17:20.040
What happened to that teacher
you were prattling on about?

17:20.123 --> 17:23.377
- Passed away.
- Croaksville. That's what l thought.

17:23.460 --> 17:26.755
What did you do
when you found out that he'd died?

17:26.839 --> 17:30.342
- l made a joke.
- l sure hope it was a good one.

17:30.425 --> 17:33.637
Here's the inside scoop.
Life's hard enough,

17:33.720 --> 17:36.849
and there's no way
you can survive in a dump like this

17:36.932 --> 17:39.852
unless you find a way
to get your emotions out.

17:39.935 --> 17:41.603
Fact.

17:41.687 --> 17:46.066
Well, l let my emotions out!
l'll show you some of this!

17:48.819 --> 17:51.238
Franklyn, l am so sorry.

17:53.615 --> 17:56.076
Wanna wear my stethoscope?

17:56.160 --> 18:00.330
The cool thing about this movie
is that this could really happen.

18:00.414 --> 18:03.876
The Russians invading,
or C Thomas Howell being a tough guy?

18:03.959 --> 18:05.252
Both.

18:08.297 --> 18:12.426
Wolverines.
Why is she always here?

18:12.509 --> 18:15.053
We're working on my study.

18:15.137 --> 18:18.056
Every time l come here
l'm gonna see him.

18:18.140 --> 18:20.934
Just get someone else
to do this project with you.

18:21.018 --> 18:23.770
Maybe the reason
why l asked you to work with me

18:23.854 --> 18:26.648
is because it would
force you to see each other.

18:26.732 --> 18:29.234
l don't want to get
back together with him.

18:29.318 --> 18:32.988
l'm not saying that.
You made a terrible couple.

18:33.071 --> 18:35.324
lt's just that...
l like you. You know?

18:35.407 --> 18:37.659
l think you're a cool person.

18:37.743 --> 18:40.329
lt doesn't matter about me and JD.

18:40.412 --> 18:43.499
- You and l can still hang out.
- No.

18:43.582 --> 18:46.376
lt can't be that way,
and you know it.

18:46.460 --> 18:48.754
Cos that's my best friend.

18:48.837 --> 18:51.798
So, either you can try and fix it, or...

18:58.555 --> 19:00.974
- This sucks.
- Yeah.

19:01.058 --> 19:04.061
<i>And baby we'll be</i>

19:04.144 --> 19:07.523
<i>At the drive-in</i>

19:07.606 --> 19:11.693
<i>In the old man's Ford</i>

19:11.777 --> 19:16.281
<i>Behind the bushes</i>

19:16.365 --> 19:22.204
<i>Till I'm screaming for more</i>

19:22.287 --> 19:26.375
<i>Down the basement</i>

19:26.458 --> 19:30.546
<i>Lock the cellar door</i>

19:30.629 --> 19:34.091
<i>And baby</i>

19:34.174 --> 19:38.637
<i>Talk dirty to</i>

19:38.720 --> 19:41.974
<i>Me</i>

19:43.267 --> 19:45.644
- l love you.
- What?

19:45.727 --> 19:48.605
<i>Know that we'll be</i>

19:48.689 --> 19:51.942
<i>At the drive-in...</i>

19:55.404 --> 19:57.823
What are you doing?

19:57.906 --> 20:01.660
This is a recommendation letter
from a high school teacher of mine.

20:01.743 --> 20:04.037
He's actually

20:04.121 --> 20:07.166
the reason l got into medicine.

20:07.249 --> 20:09.918
And he died last week.

20:10.002 --> 20:12.379
l'm so sorry, JD.

20:12.462 --> 20:14.548
l really am.

20:19.887 --> 20:22.097
Do you wanna be alone?

20:22.181 --> 20:23.932
No.

20:24.016 --> 20:26.185
You wanna cry a little?

20:27.769 --> 20:29.605
No.

20:32.399 --> 20:36.195
Wanna go throw stuff off the roof
like Letterman used to do?

20:42.117 --> 20:45.412
You see, it's the pudding
that splatters the best,

20:45.496 --> 20:50.751
because it's the pudding, and therefore
l say let the pudding pop fall!

20:50.834 --> 20:53.795
- Who is that? Arsenio?
- No.

20:53.879 --> 20:56.381
<i>Everyone has their own way of releasing</i>

20:56.465 --> 20:59.009
<i>the stuff that gets
bottled up inside them.</i>

20:59.092 --> 21:01.845
<i>It just took a good friend
to help me find mine.</i>

21:01.929 --> 21:04.223
Dr Dorian,
we're ready for the finale.

21:04.306 --> 21:06.683
Thank you, Dr Reid.

21:06.767 --> 21:08.685
OK, guys.

21:08.769 --> 21:12.022
One, two, three.

21:20.405 --> 21:22.741
<i>It felt really good.</i>

21:22.825 --> 21:24.660
Player.

21:35.045 --> 21:37.047
The horror.
