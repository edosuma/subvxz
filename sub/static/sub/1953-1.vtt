01:10.112 --> 01:14.700
Mr Bond. Mr Bond, I'm so glad
I caught you. Your office called.

01:14.700 --> 01:18.370
They're sending a helicopter
to pick you up. Some sort of emergency.

01:18.829 --> 01:20.664
It usually is. Thank you.

02:43.956 --> 02:46.500
Good afternoon, Mr Bond.

02:46.583 --> 02:51.505
Don't concern yourself with the pilot.
One of my less useful people.

02:57.094 --> 03:00.681
You are now flying
Remote Control Airways.

03:29.209 --> 03:33.088
Think twice, 007. It's a long way down.

04:08.749 --> 04:12.669
I've looked forward
to this moment, Mr Bond.

04:12.753 --> 04:16.214
I intend to enjoy it to the full.

04:53.460 --> 04:57.214
Really, have you no respect for the dead?

04:58.882 --> 05:01.176
Goodbye, Mr Bond.

05:01.301 --> 05:04.388
I trust you had a pleasant... fright?

05:22.906 --> 05:29.663
You're fading from my picture, Mr Bond,
but the end cannot be far away.

06:03.280 --> 06:06.200
Mr Bond! Mr Bond!

06:10.078 --> 06:12.164
We can do a deal.

06:12.247 --> 06:16.793
I'll buy you a delicatessen.
In stainless steel.

06:18.086 --> 06:21.423
- Please!
- All right. Keep your hair on.

06:21.507 --> 06:24.635
Put me down. Put me down!

06:24.718 --> 06:27.137
Oh, you want to get off?

06:29.723 --> 06:31.808
Mr Bond!

06:38.982 --> 06:42.069
"For Your Eyes Only" by Sheena Easton"

06:56.083 --> 07:02.589
"For your eyes only
can see me through the night"

07:04.591 --> 07:11.181
"For your eyes only I never need to hide"

07:13.267 --> 07:19.523
"You can see so much in me,
so much in me that's new"

07:21.608 --> 07:28.615
"I never felt until I looked at you"

07:28.699 --> 07:33.036
"For your eyes only"

07:33.203 --> 07:35.789
"Only for you"

07:35.873 --> 07:40.878
"You'll see what no one else can see
and now I'm breaking free"

07:40.961 --> 07:44.464
"For your eyes only"

07:44.548 --> 07:47.301
"Only for you"

07:47.384 --> 07:50.387
"The love I know you need in me"

07:50.470 --> 07:53.223
"The fantasy you've freed in me"

07:53.307 --> 07:57.227
"Only for you"

07:57.394 --> 08:01.064
"Only for you"

08:09.907 --> 08:16.163
"For your eyes only,
the nights are never cold"

08:18.499 --> 08:24.755
"You really know me,
that's all I need to know"

08:27.257 --> 08:33.514
"Maybe I'm an open book
because I know you're mine"

08:35.515 --> 08:42.523
"But you don't need
to read between the lines"

08:42.606 --> 08:47.110
"For your eyes only"

08:47.194 --> 08:49.696
"Only for you"

08:49.780 --> 08:54.785
"You'll see what no one else can see
and now I'm breaking free"

08:54.868 --> 08:58.413
"For your eyes only"

08:58.455 --> 09:01.250
"Only for you"

09:01.375 --> 09:04.211
"The passions that collide in me"

09:04.294 --> 09:07.047
"The wild abandoned side of me"

09:07.214 --> 09:10.968
"Only for you"

09:10.968 --> 09:15.389
"For your eyes only"

10:22.289 --> 10:27.252
- Afternoon. How's it looking topside?
- Beautiful day. Just bringing the nets in.

10:27.336 --> 10:29.630
Fish for supper again.

10:39.431 --> 10:43.894
Decode of Russian satellite data, sir,
on British and American ship positions.

10:43.936 --> 10:47.064
- Verify and advise Admiralty.
- Yes, sir.

10:48.941 --> 10:51.443
- Afternoon, sir.
- Hello, Mac.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.030
My watch.

11:38.574 --> 11:41.785
Where the hell did that come from?

11:45.831 --> 11:49.209
- What's going on?
- Unidentified object closing fast.

12:02.764 --> 12:05.142
Secure Operations Room!

12:06.185 --> 12:09.104
Destruct ATAC system.

12:49.394 --> 12:51.897
- Yes?
- First Sea Lord and Vice Admiral.

12:51.980 --> 12:54.399
Send them in.

12:58.654 --> 13:03.700
Shocking news. We've lost our electronic
surveillance ship, the St Georges.

13:03.784 --> 13:06.954
We had a routine message
at 1600 hours yesterday.

13:07.037 --> 13:10.541
Then nothing. We sighted
floating debris this morning.

13:10.624 --> 13:12.668
My God, Jack.

13:12.751 --> 13:17.256
- How deep is the water there?
- Not deep enough, I'm afraid.

13:20.300 --> 13:23.011
Yes, Comrade Secretary, off Albania.

13:23.095 --> 13:27.766
The suspected British spy ship
which we have been monitoring.

13:27.850 --> 13:33.647
It suggests that there is a chance
of obtaining the ATAC transmitter.

13:35.190 --> 13:38.652
Of course, Comrade.
There will be no direct involvement.

13:38.735 --> 13:46.577
But if it comes on the market we should
not lose such a remarkable opportunity.

13:46.660 --> 13:52.916
With that in mind, I've already
contacted our usual friend in Greece. Da.

14:41.340 --> 14:44.843
- Down you go. Go on.
- Down you go.

14:51.934 --> 14:57.105
- Give us a kiss. Give us a kiss.
- I'll give you a nut. Here you are.

15:01.985 --> 15:04.112
Come on.

15:04.196 --> 15:07.241
- Your packages, seÃ±orita.
- Oh, thank you.

15:11.787 --> 15:13.580
Melina!

15:30.305 --> 15:34.518
- Thank you, darling.
- Hello, Daddy.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.979
Welcome home, Melina.
You look beautiful.

15:37.104 --> 15:40.774
- Thank you.
- Your call from Athens was a surprise.

15:40.858 --> 15:44.361
I was lucky to find you.
You left Crete so suddenly.

15:44.903 --> 15:49.199
Yes. I wanted to come back here and start
work on the temple. You between jobs?

15:49.324 --> 15:52.578
Only for a few days.
I'll lend a hand, if you want.

15:52.661 --> 15:55.664
Darling, it's beautiful. Thank you.

15:55.747 --> 15:58.667
That's for you. And pistachios for Max.

17:18.789 --> 17:23.126
- James.
- Moneypenny, a feast for my eyes.

17:23.210 --> 17:27.798
- What about the rest of you?
- Well, I was going to get around to that.

17:27.881 --> 17:30.384
Well, you'd better go in. M's on leave.

17:30.467 --> 17:34.763
The minister's here with the chief of staff
and wants to see you immediately.

17:34.847 --> 17:38.100
- I'll be right back.
- I can hardly wait.

17:38.225 --> 17:41.979
Haven't you forgotten something?

17:42.062 --> 17:44.147
As M's away.

17:49.152 --> 17:52.239
- Ah, there you are, 007.
- Hm.

17:52.322 --> 17:54.241
Minister. Chief of Staff.

17:54.324 --> 17:57.035
Are you aware of our ATAC system, 007?

17:57.119 --> 18:00.747
ATAC, sir. Automatic Targeting
Attack Communicator.

18:00.831 --> 18:06.128
Uses an ultra-low frequency transmitter to
order our submarines to launch missiles.

18:06.211 --> 18:11.133
Five days ago, our spy ship St Georges
was sunk in the lonian Sea.

18:11.216 --> 18:15.721
She was equipped with ATAC. If that
transmitter fell into the wrong hands,

18:15.804 --> 18:19.683
it would render
our entire Polaris fleet useless.

18:19.766 --> 18:22.644
- Every order could be countermanded.
- Worse.

18:22.728 --> 18:27.774
Our own submarines could be ordered
to attack our own cities.

18:27.858 --> 18:30.402
Have we begun a salvage operation?

18:30.485 --> 18:32.863
An official operation was impossible.

18:32.946 --> 18:35.657
The St Georges
was off the Albanian coast.

18:35.741 --> 18:39.703
We asked Sir Timothy Havelock,
the archaeologist, to locate the wreck.

18:39.786 --> 18:45.626
Before he could report, he and his wife
were killed by a hit man, Hector Gonzales.

18:45.709 --> 18:49.379
The Greek police were able
to identify Gonzales from a description

18:49.463 --> 18:53.383
given to them by Melina,
Sir Havelock's daughter.

18:53.467 --> 18:56.553
Operation Undertow -
the information's all here.

18:56.678 --> 18:59.389
Now, Gonzales is at a villa near Madrid.

18:59.473 --> 19:04.561
Isolate him and apply the necessary
pressure to find out who hired him.

21:34.253 --> 21:37.256
A Walther PPK.

21:37.297 --> 21:40.509
Standard issue, British Secret Service.

21:40.634 --> 21:43.178
Licensed to kill...

21:44.471 --> 21:46.557
or be killed.

21:46.640 --> 21:48.851
Take him away.

22:16.879 --> 22:19.006
Excuse me.

22:37.482 --> 22:40.527
Vamos, rápido,
que no se puede escapar. Corred.

22:50.329 --> 22:52.748
Lo tenemos ahora, cógelo.

23:01.882 --> 23:03.717
...por aquí.

23:03.800 --> 23:06.178
You've outstayed your welcome.
Come on.

23:14.394 --> 23:16.939
Ése no se puede escapar.

23:17.397 --> 23:20.526
No importa. Sigue, sigue, sigue.

23:20.609 --> 23:21.985
Que se nos escapa.

23:35.916 --> 23:40.212
- Well, I hope you have a car.
- This way.

23:58.939 --> 24:01.024
Hurry.

24:12.995 --> 24:15.664
- Who are you?
- He killed my parents.

24:15.747 --> 24:18.250
The Havelocks?

24:18.333 --> 24:20.878
I'm sorry.

24:25.757 --> 24:29.636
- How did you know where Gonzales was?
- Through a detective agency.

24:29.720 --> 24:32.723
What were you doing there?

24:32.806 --> 24:35.267
I'm afraid we're being out-horsepowered.

24:50.824 --> 24:52.201
Excuse me.

25:04.963 --> 25:06.715
Take the low road.

25:08.675 --> 25:11.094
Not that low.

25:24.316 --> 25:27.402
You don't mind if I drive, do you?

25:42.459 --> 25:44.586
Por favor, empujen.

26:43.604 --> 26:46.815
- Go backwards forwards quickly.
- Hm?

27:49.044 --> 27:51.588
Love a drive in the country, don't you?

27:58.470 --> 27:59.888
Hold tight.

28:25.455 --> 28:28.375
We haven't been
properly introduced, Melina.

28:28.458 --> 28:31.795
My name is Bond... James Bond.

28:34.590 --> 28:36.717
Muchas gracias.

28:38.093 --> 28:41.221
Olympic has a flight at 11.

28:43.599 --> 28:47.561
It should be safe to go to the airport now.

28:51.690 --> 28:55.110
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

28:55.152 --> 28:57.154
Really.

28:57.237 --> 29:01.408
- Going back to your father's ship?
- Yes, I'm continuing his work.

29:01.533 --> 29:04.661
- But this business is unfinished.
- What business?

29:04.745 --> 29:07.915
The man who paid Gonzales.

29:07.998 --> 29:10.584
The Chinese have a saying.

29:10.709 --> 29:15.547
"Before setting out on revenge,
you first dig two graves."

29:15.631 --> 29:22.179
I don't expect you to understand.
You're English, but I'm half-Greek.

29:22.262 --> 29:28.602
And Greek women, like Elektra,
always avenge their loved ones.

29:28.685 --> 29:31.021
I must go.

29:37.152 --> 29:41.657
You were meant to question Gonzales,
not let Miss Havelock perforate him.

29:41.740 --> 29:43.200
I quite agree.

29:43.325 --> 29:47.454
We'll have to tell the prime minister
Operation Undertow is dead.

29:47.538 --> 29:50.249
She'll have our guts for garters.

29:50.374 --> 29:54.294
If you care to look again
at page 2 paragraph 4 of my report, sir,

29:54.378 --> 29:57.589
you will note that I saw someone
paying off Gonzales.

29:57.673 --> 30:02.344
Assuming that that was for Havelock's
murder, there is still a glimmer of hope.

30:02.427 --> 30:06.515
- I don't follow.
- If we could identify that someone...

30:06.598 --> 30:09.560
- Why don't you try the Identigraph?
- Hm.

30:10.894 --> 30:13.272
- Yes, sir.
- Well, get cracking, 007.

30:13.397 --> 30:15.023
Hm.

30:15.107 --> 30:16.608
Minister.

30:20.487 --> 30:22.364
Hello, Q.

30:22.447 --> 30:27.202
- Smithers, how's the arm?
- Coming along very nicely, thank you, sir.

30:28.245 --> 30:30.289
That'll come in handy.

30:30.372 --> 30:33.375
- What are you doing here, 007?
- Identigraph, Q.

30:33.458 --> 30:35.544
This way.

30:45.637 --> 30:50.350
- Stinging in the rain?
- That's not funny, 007.

30:50.475 --> 30:53.145
I see you got the Lotus
back together again.

30:53.228 --> 30:57.274
I disregard these gibes
about our equipment, 007.

30:57.357 --> 31:02.070
- I bet you don't find it funny in the field.
- Indeed, I don't.

31:07.242 --> 31:12.039
This 3-D visual Identigraph
is still in the experimental stage.

31:12.122 --> 31:14.917
Now, once we get
a composite of the man,

31:15.000 --> 31:19.796
we can find a match by patching into the
photographic files of the Sûreté, Interpol,

31:19.880 --> 31:22.341
CIA, the Mossad...

31:22.424 --> 31:28.180
And the West German Police. Yes,
you've told me so already, Q, five times.

31:28.263 --> 31:30.349
Thank you, 007.

31:31.350 --> 31:33.894
Right.

31:33.936 --> 31:38.148
Describe the person you wish to identify
and I'll program the information.

31:38.232 --> 31:42.194
Male Caucasian. Late 30s.

31:43.654 --> 31:46.990
Hair - fine, light brown.

31:49.535 --> 31:51.703
That's it. Parted in the middle.

31:51.787 --> 31:53.956
Wait a minute.

31:54.039 --> 31:55.082
Right.

31:55.165 --> 31:58.752
- Eyes - a little smaller.
- Uh-huh.

31:58.836 --> 32:02.631
Blue. A little greyer.

32:02.756 --> 32:05.676
That's it, you have it. Now, nose.

32:08.095 --> 32:11.265
- A nose, not a banana, Q.
- Sorry.

32:11.932 --> 32:14.852
Stop. Lips fuller.

32:14.977 --> 32:17.396
Uh-huh. Whoops.

32:18.814 --> 32:21.108
- No, no, no. Mouth wider.
- Uh-huh.

32:21.191 --> 32:23.277
Good.

32:26.321 --> 32:28.657
Thank you.

32:28.740 --> 32:31.827
Thank you, Sharon.
You can go. I'll lock up.

32:31.952 --> 32:33.996
OK.

32:35.038 --> 32:38.792
I reckon we're almost there, Q.
Apart from glasses.

32:38.876 --> 32:41.587
- Steel-rimmed.
- Yeah.

32:41.670 --> 32:44.298
- Octagonal.
- Octagonal.

32:46.884 --> 32:49.678
That's him. That's our man.

32:50.304 --> 32:53.056
Right. I'll try and get a match.

33:07.070 --> 33:09.239
Yes?

33:09.323 --> 33:12.159
Ah, sir, the man we want
is Emile Leopold Locque.

33:12.242 --> 33:14.745
An enforcer in the Brussels underworld.

33:14.828 --> 33:18.499
He's been convicted
of several particularly brutal murders.

33:18.624 --> 33:23.045
He escaped from Namur prison
by strangling his psychiatrist.

33:23.128 --> 33:26.715
He has worked for drug syndicates
in Marseilles and Hong Kong.

33:26.798 --> 33:29.259
Now reported working
for Greek smugglers.

33:29.384 --> 33:33.680
The Italian Secret Service think
that he is at this moment in Cortina.

33:33.764 --> 33:38.018
I'll instruct Ferrara, our man in
Northern Italy, to contact you there.

33:38.101 --> 33:41.355
And, 007, try not to muck it up again.

33:42.147 --> 33:44.107
I'll do my best, sir.

33:44.191 --> 33:46.777
I'll leave you to lock up.
Let me out, will you?

34:30.612 --> 34:32.906
- Grazie.
- Prego, signore.

35:25.042 --> 35:27.920
The snow this year is better at Innsbruck.

35:28.003 --> 35:30.589
But not at St Moritz.

35:30.672 --> 35:34.593
- Ferrara.
- Bond, James.

35:34.676 --> 35:36.136
Luigi.

35:36.220 --> 35:39.139
I presume London's briefed you?

35:39.223 --> 35:42.643
If Locque's in Cortina, we'll find him.

35:42.768 --> 35:46.563
I have a reliable Greek contact here.
An Anglophile.

35:46.647 --> 35:49.525
He helped us out last year
on a smuggling operation.

35:49.566 --> 35:53.153
- Then what's he doing in Cortina?
- He...

35:57.533 --> 36:00.619
...spends a few months a year
here at his chalet.

36:00.702 --> 36:04.623
He's in shipping, insurance,
oil exploration.

36:04.748 --> 36:08.669
Knows everything going on. Very reliable.

36:08.752 --> 36:12.548
The British gave him a medal
for resistance fighting during the war.

36:12.631 --> 36:15.884
- Yes, but can I meet him?
- I've set it up.

36:15.968 --> 36:18.720
He is waiting for us
at the Olympic ice rink.

36:22.140 --> 36:26.186
Good! Extend your arms.

36:35.863 --> 36:38.407
- Signor Kristatos?
- Ah.

36:40.242 --> 36:43.078
- Kristatos. Aris Kristatos.
- Bond. James Bond.

36:43.162 --> 36:48.542
- Would you join me in some gluhwein?
- That's a very good idea. Thank you.

36:48.584 --> 36:52.421
Well, gentlemen, how can I help you?

36:52.504 --> 36:55.090
We'd like some information.

37:02.598 --> 37:06.059
My protégée.
A sure winner in the next Olympics.

37:06.143 --> 37:10.898
She's completely absorbed in her skating,
but innocent in the ways of the world.

37:11.648 --> 37:16.320
The day she wins the gold medal
will be the greatest in my life.

37:23.202 --> 37:25.287
Bibi!

37:25.370 --> 37:30.125
Here are some new admirers for you.
Mr Bond, Mr Ferrara - Bibi Dahl.

37:30.209 --> 37:34.296
And her coach, Jacoba Brink.
Once a world-class skater herself.

37:34.379 --> 37:39.134
I've seen Miss Brink skate. The world will
soon see much of your skating, Miss Dahl.

37:39.218 --> 37:42.095
Only if she works harder - much harder.

37:42.179 --> 37:47.601
- Uncle Ari, can't I stop now? I'm pooped.
- That's for Miss Brink to decide.

37:47.643 --> 37:50.604
Come, Bibi. Another half-hour of practice.

37:50.687 --> 37:55.984
- Will you take me to the biathlon?
- You know I have to work this afternoon.

37:58.862 --> 38:02.324
Bibi wants to know if you
would escort her, Mr Bond.

38:02.407 --> 38:05.911
- I don't think...
- I would feel better if you were with her.

38:08.622 --> 38:11.708
Well, I'd be delighted.
I'm staying at the Miramonte.

38:11.792 --> 38:13.460
Great!

38:14.253 --> 38:17.548
Now, how can I help you?

38:17.631 --> 38:22.094
- Do you know this man?
- Yes. Locque. Columbo's right hand.

38:22.219 --> 38:27.349
Milos Columbo. His name came up
in connection with a smuggling operation.

38:27.391 --> 38:32.479
That's the least of his offences.
Drugs, white slavery, contract murder.

38:32.563 --> 38:37.818
In the Greek underworld, he is
known as "The Dove". A very sick joke.

38:37.901 --> 38:40.904
- Where is this "Dove"?
- In Greece, I would guess.

38:40.988 --> 38:43.991
Once we were like brothers.
Now he hates me.

38:44.074 --> 38:49.121
We fought together in the Greek
Resistance and against the Communists.

38:49.204 --> 38:52.791
After that, he took a different path.

38:54.835 --> 38:57.671
Well, thank you
for your time, Mr Kristatos.

38:57.754 --> 39:04.011
My pleasure. I leave for Corfu soon. If I get
any more information, I will call Ferrara.

39:13.979 --> 39:19.109
What do you think? Does this "Dove",
have the resources to mount a salvage?

39:19.193 --> 39:23.989
Definitely. He runs a fleet
of intercoastal freighters in the Aegean.

39:24.072 --> 39:27.242
I'll ring my office in Milano.
They may have more on him.

39:37.252 --> 39:41.215
- Luigi, I'll see you later.
- OK.

39:55.646 --> 39:59.066
- Is this the one you mean, signora?
- I'll take it.

39:59.149 --> 40:02.110
Deliver it to the Hotel Cristallo, please.

40:10.661 --> 40:13.580
Oh! Beg your pardon.

40:14.623 --> 40:17.167
Buongiorno. May I help you?

40:17.292 --> 40:19.753
Yes. Give me a dozen lilies, will you?

40:26.844 --> 40:29.179
I'll pick them up later.

40:36.019 --> 40:38.105
Come on, quickly.

40:54.371 --> 40:57.499
Send them to the funeral, will you?

41:01.295 --> 41:05.257
Slow down. Would you mind telling me
what you're doing in Cortina?

41:05.340 --> 41:08.719
- Your telegram.
- What telegram?

41:08.802 --> 41:12.097
It said you found the man
and to meet you here today.

41:12.181 --> 41:15.726
I didn't send a telegram. Now, get in.

41:17.436 --> 41:19.646
The station, please.

41:19.771 --> 41:23.358
- Are we leaving?
- Not "we", you. And now.

41:23.442 --> 41:25.861
You don't tell me what to do.

41:25.944 --> 41:28.697
- La stazione, per favore.
- Si, signore.

41:42.753 --> 41:45.923
Did you find the man
who hired Gonzales?

41:45.964 --> 41:47.966
I'm working on it.

41:48.050 --> 41:52.471
He's here, isn't he?
That's why you're here.

41:52.554 --> 41:55.724
- Driver, stop. Go back.
- Vai avanti.

41:55.807 --> 41:58.852
- I'm staying.
- So you can put an arrow in his back?

41:58.936 --> 42:01.980
You do that and we'll never find out
who is behind this.

42:02.064 --> 42:05.859
It was my parents they killed, not yours.
Let me out. Driver, stop.

42:05.943 --> 42:07.736
Vai avanti.

42:07.820 --> 42:09.780
Presto.

42:09.863 --> 42:14.159
Melina, look at me. You were lucky once
but they are on to you now.

42:14.243 --> 42:17.412
The telegram,
the motorcycles, they prove it.

42:17.496 --> 42:21.333
- Please, let me handle this.
- You? How are you involved?

42:21.458 --> 42:25.504
All I can say is it's something
of vital interest to both our countries.

42:25.587 --> 42:28.507
More important than my parents?

42:30.551 --> 42:35.305
Your father was part of it. He thought it
important enough to risk his life.

42:35.389 --> 42:39.226
Now, Melina, please trust me.
Go back to the Triana and wait.

42:39.309 --> 42:42.980
Let me find out what I can here,
then I'll come straight to Corfu.

42:43.063 --> 42:47.985
OK. I'll go back and wait. But not for long.

42:48.026 --> 42:50.654
It won't be, I swear.

42:53.615 --> 42:56.243
Amore, amore.

43:38.619 --> 43:41.955
Don't they have showers at the ice rink?

43:41.997 --> 43:43.999
How did you get in here?

43:44.082 --> 43:47.961
One of the porters is a fan.
He'll do anything for me.

43:48.086 --> 43:51.215
And I'll do anything for you.

43:52.341 --> 43:56.136
I'm exceedingly flattered, Bibi,
but you're in training.

43:56.261 --> 44:00.098
That's a laugh. Everybody knows
it builds up muscle tone.

44:00.224 --> 44:05.270
You can start building up a little more
muscle tone by putting on your clothes.

44:07.773 --> 44:10.901
Don't you like me?

44:10.984 --> 44:17.032
Why, I think you're wonderful, Bibi, but I
don't think your Uncle Ari would approve.

44:17.115 --> 44:20.244
Him? He thinks I'm still a virgin.

44:21.829 --> 44:27.334
Yes, well, you get your clothes on
and I'll buy you an ice cream.

44:34.925 --> 44:37.719
Ah. Shall we?

44:42.933 --> 44:45.352
Don't you ever come up for air?

44:45.477 --> 44:48.897
That's why I'll get the gold medal.
Breath control.

44:48.981 --> 44:52.067
Yes, well, you can't lose.

44:56.780 --> 45:01.160
The leading skiers are now at
the firing range: Wolf Ghul from Austria,

45:01.243 --> 45:05.914
Kerel Behrta from Switzerland,
Wolfgang Blatt from Holland...

45:21.263 --> 45:25.434
And now Eric Kriegler,
last year's East European champion.

45:25.517 --> 45:30.856
He's passing people and coming up on
the West German champion, Hans Wolf.

45:34.151 --> 45:37.529
- There's Eric Kriegler.
- The East German champion?

45:38.739 --> 45:42.951
- Isn't he beautiful?
- You know something, Bibi? You're fickle.

45:44.161 --> 45:46.288
Hey, Eric!

45:48.040 --> 45:51.126
Come on, let's go watch him shoot.

46:16.068 --> 46:18.570
Eric!

46:18.654 --> 46:22.533
Eric, we'll have a drink at the finish.

46:24.910 --> 46:29.122
- Well, Bibi, I'm afraid I have to leave you.
- No, James, stay with me.

46:29.206 --> 46:31.625
I have an appointment.

46:31.708 --> 46:35.045
Will you come and say goodbye
at the practice rink later?

46:35.128 --> 46:37.631
Please, we're going back to Greece soon.

46:37.714 --> 46:41.969
All right, but if I can't make it,
all I can say is don't grow up any more.

46:42.052 --> 46:46.431
- Huh?
- The opposite sex would never survive it.

50:05.714 --> 50:07.758
Libero.

50:52.886 --> 50:54.972
Libero.

51:16.827 --> 51:18.704
Libero.

51:29.965 --> 51:32.676
- Ehi tu, dov'è il casco?
- Guarda.

51:39.183 --> 51:40.934
Guardia, c'è un pazzo qua.

55:53.437 --> 55:56.398
It won't take long.
Don't play with the switches.

55:56.523 --> 55:58.358
Right.

56:11.246 --> 56:12.956
James!

56:13.040 --> 56:17.336
- James, what took you so long?
- Well, I took the scenic route.

56:18.545 --> 56:21.632
Tell me more about
your boyfriend, Eric Kriegler.

56:21.673 --> 56:27.137
He doesn't smoke, he only eats health
foods and he won't even talk to girls.

56:27.221 --> 56:30.641
- James, you're jealous.
- Of course.

56:30.766 --> 56:34.686
What else can you tell me about
my rival for your affections?

56:34.812 --> 56:37.564
They say he's a defector
from East Germany.

56:37.648 --> 56:40.901
Bibi! It is time for your rubdown.

56:50.160 --> 56:52.913
I could eat you up alive.

56:55.833 --> 56:59.336
Farewell, Mr Bond, but not goodbye.

58:41.063 --> 58:45.442
I'll be finished around six, Mikes.
Meet me here.

58:45.567 --> 58:48.612
James, how did you know I was here?

58:48.737 --> 58:51.990
I radiotelephoned the Triana.
They said you were coming ashore.

58:52.074 --> 58:56.286
I have to go shopping for the crew. Why
don't you come with me and we can talk?

59:06.171 --> 59:08.048
Yassou.

59:20.853 --> 59:22.729
Parakalo.

59:27.401 --> 59:30.154
I think you may need that.

59:55.929 --> 59:58.599
My father loved the view from here.

59:58.682 --> 01:00:02.811
- I can see why.
- We came here often.

01:00:02.936 --> 01:00:04.980
- Is Corfu your home?
- No.

01:00:05.063 --> 01:00:07.524
My real home's always been the Triana.

01:00:07.649 --> 01:00:12.863
The Greek islands, Turkey, North Africa,
wherever my father's work took us.

01:00:14.531 --> 01:00:17.951
Did he leave any notes?
They could help us.

01:00:18.035 --> 01:00:20.954
No, I don't think so.

01:00:21.997 --> 01:00:24.541
To tell the truth,

01:00:24.625 --> 01:00:29.004
I haven't had the courage
to go into his study since...

01:00:29.087 --> 01:00:31.173
Try not to think about it now.

01:00:31.256 --> 01:00:35.761
I'm meeting a man tonight at the casino
who may give us a lead.

01:00:40.307 --> 01:00:43.977
Cinq cent mille banque, monsieur.
Qui fait banco?

01:00:46.396 --> 01:00:49.191
Banco. Carte, s'il vous plaît.

01:00:58.325 --> 01:01:00.536
- Huit.
- Huit.

01:01:02.329 --> 01:01:04.915
Et neuf la banque.

01:01:06.542 --> 01:01:09.002
You're perspiring, Bunky.

01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:13.340
Good evening, Contessa.

01:01:15.008 --> 01:01:17.636
Un million banque, monsieur.
Qui fait banco?

01:01:19.429 --> 01:01:21.515
Your Lordship?

01:01:23.684 --> 01:01:25.227
Five hundred thousand.

01:01:25.310 --> 01:01:28.605
Only half? Where's your courage, Bunky?

01:01:28.689 --> 01:01:33.610
Courage is no match
for an unfriendly shoe, Countess.

01:01:34.653 --> 01:01:37.072
- Un million.
- Bravo, Bunky.

01:01:39.366 --> 01:01:43.453
Banco suivi.
Carte, s'il vous plaît.

01:01:43.537 --> 01:01:46.415
A lucky night.

01:01:50.419 --> 01:01:52.462
Carte.

01:02:03.390 --> 01:02:06.143
The odds favour standing pat.

01:02:06.226 --> 01:02:08.312
If you play the odds.

01:02:10.022 --> 01:02:13.317
Neuf la banque.

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:15.652
- La main passe.
- La main passe.

01:02:15.736 --> 01:02:18.989
Would you cash
these in for me, please?

01:02:20.199 --> 01:02:23.118
Thank you. Excuse me.

01:02:41.678 --> 01:02:44.640
- Aperitif, please?
- Ouzo for me, please.

01:02:44.723 --> 01:02:47.309
Ouzo.

01:02:47.434 --> 01:02:49.937
And a whiskey.

01:02:50.938 --> 01:02:52.397
And to eat?

01:02:52.481 --> 01:02:57.444
I'll have the Préveza prawns,
Savara salad, and bourdetto.

01:02:57.528 --> 01:02:59.571
Excellent choice. I'll have the same.

01:02:59.655 --> 01:03:03.450
May I suggest a white Robola wine
from Cephalonia, my home place?

01:03:03.534 --> 01:03:07.371
If you'll forgive me, I find that
a little too scented for my palate.

01:03:07.454 --> 01:03:10.624
- I prefer the Theotaki Aspro.
- Theotaki.

01:03:12.918 --> 01:03:14.753
After our last meeting,

01:03:14.837 --> 01:03:19.883
I am asking myself why you want
to know about Locque, Columbo's man.

01:03:19.967 --> 01:03:24.972
Now, I know Columbo runs heroin to be
refined here before it is sent to England.

01:03:25.055 --> 01:03:30.936
So I think I see the answer.
You are from the British Narcotics Board.

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:34.982
- Am I right?
- Go on.

01:03:35.732 --> 01:03:37.067
Hm.

01:03:37.151 --> 01:03:39.820
I wish you luck, my friend.

01:03:39.903 --> 01:03:43.031
But I must warn you.
Stopping Columbo will be difficult.

01:03:43.115 --> 01:03:46.618
He has important connections.
You cannot just arrest him.

01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:49.121
You must find a different way.

01:03:49.621 --> 01:03:55.377
You may have to kill him.
Does this discourage you?

01:03:57.504 --> 01:04:01.884
- Just tell me where he is.
- Over there, with the woman in blue.

01:04:05.637 --> 01:04:08.891
We ignore each other,
but I wanted you to see him.

01:04:08.974 --> 01:04:13.103
He is a secret partner in the casino here,
but we are perfectly safe.

01:04:13.145 --> 01:04:16.190
He will do nothing in his own place.

01:04:16.273 --> 01:04:18.567
And the Countess?

01:04:18.650 --> 01:04:23.197
Lisl? An Austrian. Expensive mistress.

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:27.993
She sometimes shills for the house.
If she bets, it's with other people's money.

01:04:49.848 --> 01:04:52.976
But I must warn you.
Stopping Columbo will be difficult.

01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:56.563
He has important connections.
You cannot just arrest him.

01:04:56.647 --> 01:04:59.316
You must find a different way.

01:04:59.399 --> 01:05:05.531
You may have to kill him.
Does this discourage you?

01:05:06.865 --> 01:05:09.952
Just tell me where he is.

01:05:23.006 --> 01:05:26.468
You are a disgusting man.
How dare you talk to me like that?

01:05:26.552 --> 01:05:29.221
I will speak to you any way I please.

01:05:29.304 --> 01:05:33.350
Sit down. You're making
a spectacle of yourself.

01:05:34.977 --> 01:05:36.728
Get out!

01:05:36.812 --> 01:05:39.982
Nothing would please me more.

01:05:47.322 --> 01:05:50.450
- This may be an opportunity.
- This may be a trap.

01:05:50.534 --> 01:05:54.746
- If you play the odds.
- As you wish. Take my car.

01:05:54.830 --> 01:05:59.626
I'll play a little chemmy.
Ask the chauffeur to come back for me.

01:06:09.136 --> 01:06:10.929
Allow me.

01:06:11.013 --> 01:06:13.056
May I drive you home?

01:06:13.182 --> 01:06:15.809
No, thank you. I'll take a taxi.

01:06:15.893 --> 01:06:20.898
No courage? Seriously, you may
have a job finding one this time of night.

01:06:22.024 --> 01:06:24.943
Well, you look like a gentleman.

01:06:25.027 --> 01:06:27.112
Why not?

01:06:35.162 --> 01:06:37.414
I'm the Countess Lisl von Schlaf.

01:06:37.498 --> 01:06:39.374
My name is Bond.

01:06:39.458 --> 01:06:43.837
I'm a writer. I'm preparing a novel about
Greek smugglers. Do you know any?

01:06:43.921 --> 01:06:47.257
Smugglers?
How would I know any smugglers?

01:06:47.341 --> 01:06:53.680
I would have thought that a lady in your
position would get to know many things.

01:06:53.764 --> 01:06:57.059
- I'd really be most grateful.
- How grateful?

01:06:57.142 --> 01:06:58.435
Very.

01:06:59.269 --> 01:07:02.439
I adore grateful men.

01:07:32.052 --> 01:07:34.638
May I call you tomorrow, Countess?

01:07:34.721 --> 01:07:38.183
I'm a night person.
I've champagne and oysters in the fridge.

01:07:38.267 --> 01:07:40.519
Why not come in for a bite?

01:07:43.897 --> 01:07:46.984
I won't need you any more tonight.

01:08:13.635 --> 01:08:16.345
- Cheers.
- Bottoms up.

01:08:21.435 --> 01:08:23.228
Whoops!

01:08:23.312 --> 01:08:26.148
Me nightie's slipping.

01:08:26.231 --> 01:08:28.692
So's your accent, Countess.

01:08:30.068 --> 01:08:32.571
- Manchester?
- Close.

01:08:32.696 --> 01:08:35.115
Liverpool.

01:08:35.198 --> 01:08:40.328
It was a very amusing performance
between you and the owner of this.

01:08:40.412 --> 01:08:43.040
What exactly did
Columbo whisper to you?

01:08:43.122 --> 01:08:46.752
That you were a spy.
To find out more about you.

01:08:48.002 --> 01:08:50.839
And have you?

01:08:50.923 --> 01:08:53.634
Have I ever.

01:09:18.367 --> 01:09:22.662
When you're ready to leave,
you can take my car.

01:09:22.703 --> 01:09:28.210
Well, that sounds like a dismissal.
I was rather looking forward to breakfast.

01:09:44.017 --> 01:09:46.270
Oh, James!

01:10:07.666 --> 01:10:10.794
Lisl! Lisl, come back!

01:10:43.744 --> 01:10:45.329
Get in. Ugh!

01:10:57.841 --> 01:11:00.135
Goodbye, Countess.

01:11:04.973 --> 01:11:07.142
What...

01:11:49.309 --> 01:11:52.938
- Now, what should I do with you?
- You can't just arrest him.

01:11:53.021 --> 01:11:55.232
You must find a different way.

01:11:55.315 --> 01:12:00.112
You may have to kill him.
Does this discourage you?

01:12:01.321 --> 01:12:02.990
Just tell me where he is.

01:12:03.073 --> 01:12:07.744
I am here, Mr Bond
of the British Secret Service.

01:12:07.828 --> 01:12:12.499
But I'll tell you,
it is Kristatos you want, not me.

01:12:13.292 --> 01:12:19.006
He told you about himself. He's the one
with the powerful connections.

01:12:19.131 --> 01:12:21.550
Locque works for him, not for me.

01:12:21.633 --> 01:12:27.598
I smuggle, yes. I smuggle gold,
diamonds, cigarettes, pistachio nuts.

01:12:27.681 --> 01:12:29.975
But no heroin.

01:12:30.058 --> 01:12:32.060
Sit down.

01:12:32.102 --> 01:12:36.690
That I leave to him, when he is
not too busy working for Russia.

01:12:36.773 --> 01:12:40.903
- Against my country and yours.
- My country awarded him a King's Medal.

01:12:40.986 --> 01:12:44.573
Yes, I know, but other people died for it.

01:12:44.656 --> 01:12:49.119
All through the fighting in Crete,
he was a double agent.

01:12:50.245 --> 01:12:53.165
King's Medal!

01:12:53.248 --> 01:12:58.545
I would laugh if my heart
was not so heavy about my poor Lisl.

01:13:00.422 --> 01:13:04.301
What does Kristatos gain
by setting you up?

01:13:04.384 --> 01:13:09.515
I know too much about him.
He wants me out of the way.

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:15.437
By using a British agent
to do his dirty work for him,

01:13:15.521 --> 01:13:18.607
your government might
give him another medal.

01:13:18.690 --> 01:13:22.653
- Why should I believe you?
- I'll prove it to you tonight.

01:13:22.736 --> 01:13:27.533
We'll go together
to his warehouse in Albania.

01:13:27.908 --> 01:13:29.618
OK?

01:13:29.701 --> 01:13:33.455
If I don't report in by tomorrow morning,
not only will my people

01:13:33.539 --> 01:13:37.626
but the entire Greek police
be down on you like a load of bricks.

01:13:37.709 --> 01:13:43.131
Don't worry.
By tomorrow we'll be good friends.

01:13:44.716 --> 01:13:47.469
Let us drink to that.

01:13:47.553 --> 01:13:49.930
I'll wait till tomorrow.

01:14:01.775 --> 01:14:03.902
You may need this.

01:14:05.070 --> 01:14:07.156
I am a good judge of men.

01:14:07.239 --> 01:14:12.286
Mr Bond, you have
what the Greeks call thrassos.

01:14:12.369 --> 01:14:13.912
Guts.

01:14:16.039 --> 01:14:18.667
So have you, Mr Columbo.

01:14:26.175 --> 01:14:28.010
Cheers.

01:14:28.093 --> 01:14:30.053
Yassou.

01:15:08.091 --> 01:15:09.885
Locque!

01:15:39.373 --> 01:15:40.457
Phew!

01:16:11.405 --> 01:16:13.782
Santos, sproxto.

01:16:18.704 --> 01:16:19.913
Argh!

01:16:28.589 --> 01:16:30.048
Watch it.

01:16:35.637 --> 01:16:38.682
Santos. Nikos.

01:16:45.939 --> 01:16:51.278
JIM diving equipment, for salvage work
at depths of more than 300 feet.

01:17:04.958 --> 01:17:07.336
Raw opium.

01:17:07.419 --> 01:17:10.380
An old smugglers' trick.
Kristatos knows them all.

01:17:53.173 --> 01:17:55.968
Get your men out of here. Now!

01:18:02.182 --> 01:18:03.267
Argh!

01:19:33.148 --> 01:19:34.399
Argh!

01:20:00.092 --> 01:20:03.554
You left this with Ferrara, I believe.

01:20:21.405 --> 01:20:24.074
He had no head for heights.

01:21:53.455 --> 01:21:58.085
- Where did the St Georges sink?
- We can't be sure for certain.

01:21:58.210 --> 01:22:03.131
We know it was in this vicinity. Your father
was using the temple as a front.

01:22:03.257 --> 01:22:08.679
Kristatos killed your father because
he didn't want him to find the St Georges.

01:22:08.762 --> 01:22:11.223
Kristatos!

01:22:11.348 --> 01:22:13.392
How can I help?

01:22:13.475 --> 01:22:16.603
Where did your father
keep his records, his daily log?

01:22:16.687 --> 01:22:18.730
Daily log. Daily log.

01:22:18.856 --> 01:22:23.652
Father and he were pals for 30 years.
He repeats everything.

01:22:26.530 --> 01:22:28.657
Give us a kiss.

01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:30.784
- What's his name?
- Max.

01:22:30.826 --> 01:22:34.037
- Max.
- Thank you.

01:22:35.497 --> 01:22:37.583
Hello.

01:22:41.086 --> 01:22:44.131
- It's all shorthand.
- He used a special kind.

01:22:44.214 --> 01:22:47.593
I was the only one who could decipher it.

01:22:50.637 --> 01:22:53.557
He made several surveys in Neptune.

01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:57.686
- What's Neptune?
- Our two-man submarine.

01:22:57.769 --> 01:23:01.356
According to this,
he saw a diving bell here.

01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:03.609
Diving bell?

01:23:03.734 --> 01:23:06.904
Oil exploration, Kristatos.

01:23:09.114 --> 01:23:13.785
Three days later, he sighted
a wreck in the same area.

01:23:13.911 --> 01:23:15.662
And?

01:23:15.746 --> 01:23:18.957
That was his last entry.
The day he was killed.

01:23:19.041 --> 01:23:23.045
Ah. Well, air would be
useless at this depth.

01:23:23.128 --> 01:23:26.215
We'd need a special mixture
of oxygen and helium.

01:23:26.298 --> 01:23:29.718
I have all the necessary
equipment aboard.

01:23:29.802 --> 01:23:32.638
The less people that know
about this, the better.

01:23:32.721 --> 01:23:36.433
I'll give the crew shore leave,
apart from the mate and two others.

01:23:36.517 --> 01:23:37.559
Let's go.

01:25:05.230 --> 01:25:10.569
584 feet. An oxygen-helium mix at
that depth will gives us eight minutes.

01:25:10.652 --> 01:25:12.821
We're going to have to work fast.

01:25:12.905 --> 01:25:16.283
Wouldn't the St Georges crew
have destroyed the transmitter?

01:25:16.366 --> 01:25:20.037
Only if they'd had the chance
to set the explosive timer.

01:25:51.401 --> 01:25:54.363
We have a visitor below.

01:26:01.411 --> 01:26:06.291
Conserve your gas supply.
Speak only when necessary.

01:26:56.133 --> 01:26:59.595
I hope he was dining alone.

01:27:23.535 --> 01:27:26.955
- You'd better go back to the sub.
- No, no. I'm staying.

01:27:38.217 --> 01:27:41.512
That should be
the command cabin.

01:28:02.574 --> 01:28:04.618
Eureka.

01:28:13.335 --> 01:28:17.172
"Main destruct timer under lever
right of ATAC housing

01:28:17.297 --> 01:28:22.970
dualled by ring-mained circuit
through antihandling charger."

01:28:23.095 --> 01:28:28.350
The destruct timer's set at one minute.
For some reason, the lever wasn't pulled.

01:28:34.439 --> 01:28:38.026
The transmitter with a Thermite charge.

01:28:54.835 --> 01:28:57.004
Hold these.

01:28:57.087 --> 01:29:02.551
"To bypass trembler switch,
cut wires in following procedure."

01:29:04.052 --> 01:29:05.471
Cutters.

01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:26.825
Screwdriver.

01:29:43.592 --> 01:29:46.345
That's it. Let's get out of here.

01:29:47.262 --> 01:29:49.264
James!

01:30:50.409 --> 01:30:53.662
- James, I won't make it.
- We both will.

01:30:58.709 --> 01:31:02.212
Get back to the sub fast. I'll stall him.

01:33:43.832 --> 01:33:45.375
James!

01:34:23.163 --> 01:34:26.250
- Try and close the CO2.
- I'm trying.

01:35:55.547 --> 01:35:59.343
Careful, James. It's 5000 years old.

01:36:38.132 --> 01:36:42.136
Thank you, Mr Bond. You have saved us
the trouble of disarming it.

01:36:42.219 --> 01:36:44.680
Apostis, take that.

01:36:47.933 --> 01:36:52.396
- Where are the men I left on board?
- You will soon be joining them.

01:36:52.479 --> 01:36:56.567
Let the girl go. And I guarantee
we'll double whatever you're getting.

01:36:56.692 --> 01:37:02.865
Oh, I never go back on a deal.
It would be bad for my reputation.

01:37:19.923 --> 01:37:22.718
I will deliver it
and return with the money.

01:37:22.801 --> 01:37:28.348
The voice of the KGB. Our agreement was
to meet in a place designated by me.

01:37:28.974 --> 01:37:32.686
After they pay,
I will turn the transmitter over to them.

01:37:32.769 --> 01:37:37.774
- It must not go out of your sight, Apostis.
- Or mine, Kristatos. Where are we going?

01:37:37.858 --> 01:37:42.154
- We will take the ATAC to St Cyrils.
- St Cyrils?

01:37:42.196 --> 01:37:45.199
I'll arrange the pick-up.

01:37:50.871 --> 01:37:55.417
Ah, bind that wound.
We don't want any blood in the water.

01:37:55.501 --> 01:37:57.878
- Not yet.
- Murderer.

01:37:58.545 --> 01:38:02.966
You have shot your last bolt,
Miss Havelock.

01:38:06.136 --> 01:38:09.807
Leave the legs free.
They'll make appetising bait.

01:38:19.733 --> 01:38:23.695
- I didn't think it would end like this.
- We're not dead yet.

01:38:50.389 --> 01:38:51.849
Hold tight.

01:39:17.124 --> 01:39:19.793
Turn around. We go again.

01:39:24.882 --> 01:39:27.426
Take a deep breath.

01:40:22.481 --> 01:40:25.734
Once again. Hurry.

01:41:03.397 --> 01:41:04.606
Argh!

01:41:17.161 --> 01:41:18.579
Leave him.

01:41:21.290 --> 01:41:24.084
Turn. Run them down.

01:41:41.602 --> 01:41:43.854
Follow me.

01:42:26.271 --> 01:42:28.232
Ah.

01:42:28.315 --> 01:42:32.194
The sharks have them. Make port.

01:42:53.465 --> 01:42:56.385
- Thank you.
- Hello.

01:42:59.471 --> 01:43:03.433
- Give us a kiss.
- Max, not now.

01:43:03.517 --> 01:43:06.270
Kristatos is still alive.

01:43:06.353 --> 01:43:10.107
He's probably on his way
to Moscow or Havana by now.

01:43:10.190 --> 01:43:13.819
- We'll never get him.
- Or the ATAC.

01:43:13.902 --> 01:43:16.989
ATAC to St Cyrils. ATAC to St Cyrils.

01:43:22.077 --> 01:43:24.496
ATAC to St Cyrils.

01:44:31.188 --> 01:44:33.607
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

01:44:33.690 --> 01:44:37.110
That's putting it mildly, 007.

01:44:37.820 --> 01:44:40.531
Your signal sent Whitehall into shock.

01:44:40.614 --> 01:44:47.704
Do you know, so far we've managed
to locate 439 St Cyrils in Greece?

01:44:47.788 --> 01:44:52.084
Heaven only knows to which one
Kristatos took the ATAC.

01:44:52.209 --> 01:44:55.504
I know a well-informed person
to contact about that, Q.

01:45:09.601 --> 01:45:13.480
St Cyrils,
where we used to hide from the Germans.

01:45:13.605 --> 01:45:19.027
Only Kristatos would make an abandoned
monastery his personal retreat.

01:45:19.111 --> 01:45:24.783
My friend, I've been studying this place
for years for just such an occasion.

01:45:24.867 --> 01:45:30.622
We'll split here. The best approach will be
on the right face, away from the building.

01:45:30.706 --> 01:45:33.083
Then make towards the shed on the left,

01:45:33.167 --> 01:45:36.628
which houses the basket
and the electronic winch.

01:45:36.712 --> 01:45:39.548
It can be operated only from the shed.

01:45:40.299 --> 01:45:42.342
Good luck.

01:45:51.059 --> 01:45:54.605
- We need more people.
- James is counting on surprise.

01:45:54.730 --> 01:45:58.567
- But we are only five men.
- And one woman.

01:46:50.202 --> 01:46:54.623
18, 19, 20...

01:46:55.791 --> 01:46:57.543
- 50 more.
- That's the pits!

01:46:57.626 --> 01:47:01.046
I'm supposed to be skating
in Oslo and Innsbruck.

01:47:01.130 --> 01:47:02.965
Why are we in this creepy place?

01:47:03.048 --> 01:47:07.469
Our plans are changed. We are going
to live in Cuba for a few months.

01:47:07.594 --> 01:47:08.846
Cuba?!

01:47:08.929 --> 01:47:12.224
You can skate privately.
I will be your audience.

01:47:12.307 --> 01:47:16.770
What a drag that'll be.
I wanna win the gold medal.

01:47:16.854 --> 01:47:18.564
We all want that.

01:47:18.647 --> 01:47:23.485
I know what you want.
But you're too old for me. I'm splitting.

01:47:24.361 --> 01:47:27.823
You have done this,
poisoned her against me!

01:47:27.948 --> 01:47:30.409
Don't blow your top, Ari. Leave her alone.

01:47:30.492 --> 01:47:36.123
I will deal with you, Jacoba Brink,
as I deal with everyone who betrays me.

01:47:45.215 --> 01:47:49.428
Bibi, you're so young.

01:47:50.846 --> 01:47:55.058
- You must have a sponsor.
- I'll find another one.

01:47:55.142 --> 01:48:00.105
Go outside and check the guards. Let me
know as soon as the helicopter arrives.

01:53:07.955 --> 01:53:10.040
James!

01:53:13.585 --> 01:53:16.505
Apostis. One of Kristatos' killers.

01:55:59.585 --> 01:56:02.713
Shut him up!

01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:09.094
Get the door.

01:56:18.479 --> 01:56:21.648
Hurry, unless you want me
to go without you.

01:56:21.732 --> 01:56:25.277
You know I will never leave you.

01:56:27.946 --> 01:56:30.324
Your general is late.

01:56:30.407 --> 01:56:32.993
Only bad weather would delay him.

01:56:47.174 --> 01:56:51.386
Cover the windows. Let's go.

01:56:51.470 --> 01:56:54.181
He's all right, leave him.

01:57:01.396 --> 01:57:03.023
He's all right.

01:57:03.106 --> 01:57:04.942
Back.

01:57:07.986 --> 01:57:10.072
Sh!

01:57:13.367 --> 01:57:15.828
OK. Let's go.

01:57:15.953 --> 01:57:18.747
I'll be with you.

01:57:18.831 --> 01:57:19.748
Sorry.

01:57:31.969 --> 01:57:34.680
Cover the door!

01:57:34.763 --> 01:57:37.474
Where's Kristatos? Keep your voice down.

01:57:37.558 --> 01:57:41.186
We are leaving him.
He must not know until we are gone.

01:57:41.270 --> 01:57:45.399
- We'll help you if you help us.
- Ja, mein Herr Bond. Ja.

01:57:45.482 --> 01:57:47.359
Come.

01:57:57.828 --> 01:58:01.623
- Where are the guards?
- That way.

01:58:36.742 --> 01:58:38.619
Hey.

01:58:53.008 --> 01:58:54.676
Move.

01:58:58.222 --> 01:59:01.767
- Where's Kristatos?
- The other side of the courtyard.

01:59:01.850 --> 01:59:04.603
You'd better stay here.

01:59:12.820 --> 01:59:15.364
Where's Brink?
What have you done to her?

01:59:15.447 --> 01:59:18.951
- Go back to your room.
- You can go to hell!

01:59:51.108 --> 01:59:53.443
Drop it.

02:01:15.567 --> 02:01:18.654
- Where's Kristatos?
- He left with the ATAC.

02:01:29.623 --> 02:01:33.127
You're going to pay for it.

02:01:47.182 --> 02:01:52.062
No, Melina. That's not the answer.
We'll turn him over to the Greek police.

02:01:52.146 --> 02:01:54.189
Out of my way, James.

02:01:54.940 --> 02:01:59.736
All right. But be prepared
to dig those two graves.

02:02:17.296 --> 02:02:19.339
Nyet!

02:02:36.940 --> 02:02:42.237
That's dÃ©tente, comrade.
You don't have it, I don't have it.

02:03:14.394 --> 02:03:18.315
Well, seems as though
Bibi has a new sponsor.

02:03:28.534 --> 02:03:32.746
- Well, how's it going?
- I patched through a line to the satellite.

02:03:32.830 --> 02:03:35.499
- We can try Bond now.
- Good.

02:03:35.582 --> 02:03:38.961
- Are you through to Number 10?
- Standing by, sir.

02:03:42.923 --> 02:03:46.218
You know what I'd like?

02:03:46.301 --> 02:03:48.470
I can't imagine.

02:03:48.595 --> 02:03:50.806
A moonlight swim.

02:03:54.977 --> 02:03:57.938
007, are you there?

02:04:01.650 --> 02:04:03.527
Bond?

02:04:04.153 --> 02:04:06.029
Bond?

02:04:07.072 --> 02:04:11.118
Bond, are you there? Bond!

02:04:11.201 --> 02:04:13.412
For your eyes only, darling.

02:04:16.290 --> 02:04:18.000
Bond? Bond?

02:04:18.125 --> 02:04:19.293
Bond, Bond.

02:04:19.376 --> 02:04:21.920
- He's there.
- Patch in the prime minister.

02:04:25.841 --> 02:04:28.552
I'll get it, Denis.

02:04:30.929 --> 02:04:34.183
- Hello?
- Mr Bond on the line, Prime Minister.

02:04:34.266 --> 02:04:36.435
Ah, Mr Bond.

02:04:37.269 --> 02:04:41.190
I wanted to call you personally
to say how pleased we all are

02:04:41.273 --> 02:04:44.401
that your mission was a success.
Thank you.

02:04:44.485 --> 02:04:47.696
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Don't thank me, Mr Bond.

02:04:47.779 --> 02:04:52.910
Your courage and resourcefulness
are a credit to the nation.

02:04:52.993 --> 02:04:55.162
Denis and I look forward to meeting you.

02:04:55.245 --> 02:04:58.040
Meanwhile, if there
is anything I can do for you...

02:04:58.165 --> 02:05:03.462
- Give us a kiss. Give us a kiss.
- Well, really, Mr Bond.

02:05:03.545 --> 02:05:07.549
- I think we're having trouble with the line.
- Give us a kiss.

02:05:07.633 --> 02:05:11.595
- You idiot. Get on to him.
- 007.

02:05:11.678 --> 02:05:14.264
007!

02:05:14.348 --> 02:05:16.892
Bond, have you gone mad?
What's going on?

02:05:16.975 --> 02:05:19.561
Bond? Bond! Bond!

02:05:20.521 --> 02:05:27.069
"For your eyes only
can see me through the night"

02:05:28.987 --> 02:05:35.244
"For your eyes only I never need to hide"

02:05:37.704 --> 02:05:43.544
"You can see so much in me,
so much in me that's new"

02:05:46.046 --> 02:05:53.095
"I never felt until I looked at you"

02:05:53.178 --> 02:05:57.516
"For your eyes only"

02:05:57.599 --> 02:06:00.144
"Only for you"

02:06:00.269 --> 02:06:05.149
"You'll see what no one else can see
and now I'm breaking free"

02:06:05.232 --> 02:06:08.861
"For your eyes only"

02:06:08.944 --> 02:06:11.697
"Only for you"

02:06:11.780 --> 02:06:14.575
"The love I know you need in me"

02:06:14.658 --> 02:06:17.619
"The fantasy you've freed in me"

02:06:17.703 --> 02:06:21.665
"Only for you"

02:06:21.874 --> 02:06:25.752
"Only for you"

02:06:34.386 --> 02:06:40.684
"For your eyes only,
the nights are never cold"

02:06:42.978 --> 02:06:49.193
"You really know me,
that's all I need to know"

02:06:51.653 --> 02:06:57.951
"Maybe I'm an open book
because I know you're mine"

02:06:59.995 --> 02:07:07.002
"But you don't need
to read between the lines"

02:07:07.127 --> 02:07:11.507
"For your eyes only"

02:07:11.632 --> 02:07:14.134
"Only for you"

02:07:14.259 --> 02:07:19.139
"You'll see what no one else can see
and now I'm breaking free"

02:07:19.223 --> 02:07:22.851
"For your eyes only"

02:07:22.935 --> 02:07:25.646
"Only for you"

02:07:25.771 --> 02:07:28.649
"The passions that collide in me"

02:07:28.732 --> 02:07:31.568
"The wild abandoned side of me"

02:07:31.652 --> 02:07:35.322
"Only for you"

02:07:35.405 --> 02:07:40.869
"For your eyes only"

02:07:40.953 --> 02:07:44.039
