00:02.001 --> 00:03.294
Previously on Lost:

00:03.379 --> 00:06.589
- How many drinks did you have, Dad?
- Are you lecturing me?

00:06.674 --> 00:09.092
The nurses told me
that your hands were shaking.

00:09.176 --> 00:11.302
In my professional opinion,

00:11.387 --> 00:13.596
by the time I was called in,

00:13.681 --> 00:15.848
the damage was irreversible.

00:15.933 --> 00:19.268
I need to... revise my statement.

00:19.353 --> 00:22.146
I didn't come into the OR
until well into the procedure.

00:22.231 --> 00:24.691
- This is not...
- It was clear that my father

00:24.775 --> 00:27.402
severed the patient's
hepatic artery,

00:28.278 --> 00:30.530
which,
in my professional opinion,

00:30.614 --> 00:32.240
led to her death.

00:34.118 --> 00:36.786
"Dear Mr. Sawyer,
you don't know who I am,

00:36.870 --> 00:38.579
but I know what you've done.

00:38.664 --> 00:40.540
You had sex with my mother,

00:40.624 --> 00:43.209
and then you stole
my dad's money all away.

00:43.293 --> 00:46.129
I'm going to find you
and give you this letter

00:46.213 --> 00:48.214
so you'll remember
what you done to me."

00:48.298 --> 00:49.632
I looked at the envelope.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.552
You wrote this letter.

00:52.636 --> 00:55.054
Your name's not Sawyer, is it?

00:55.139 --> 00:57.890
It was his name.
He was a confidence man.

00:57.975 --> 01:00.351
Romanced my momma
to get to the money.

01:00.436 --> 01:02.729
Wiped them out clean,
left a mess behind.

01:02.813 --> 01:04.230
You were just a kid.

01:12.114 --> 01:13.531
- Wake up.
- Open this door!

01:13.615 --> 01:15.533
- He's here.
- Open this door!

01:15.617 --> 01:16.993
Come on.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.327
Got to get you up.

01:18.662 --> 01:21.831
He'll think you're still
with your grandparents, OK?

01:21.915 --> 01:23.583
Get under the bed.

01:23.667 --> 01:25.752
Let's go. OK.
Listen to Mommy.

01:25.836 --> 01:28.004
This is important.
Get under the bed.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.757
Don't make a sound.
Don't come out.

01:30.841 --> 01:34.260
No matter what happens,
don't come out, OK?

01:34.344 --> 01:36.679
- OK.
- Oh, God.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.391
- I love you.
- I love you too, Mommy.

01:40.476 --> 01:43.102
Let's go. Down you go.

01:43.187 --> 01:46.397
- All right.
- Brooke, open this door!

01:47.983 --> 01:51.694
Stop it!

01:52.529 --> 01:53.863
Go away!

01:55.741 --> 01:57.158
Stop it!

01:57.242 --> 01:59.619
What the hell
is wrong with you?

01:59.703 --> 02:01.954
I'm calling the police!
Get out of here!

02:02.039 --> 02:03.581
What are you doing?

02:03.665 --> 02:05.124
What are you doing with a gun?

04:07.998 --> 04:10.791
It'll come back around.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.568
Boar took your tarp?

04:37.653 --> 04:40.571
It was dark, but, yeah,
pretty sure it was a boar.

04:40.656 --> 04:42.406
I thought the boar had vacated.

04:42.491 --> 04:45.159
Well, genius, I think
we got some bad info.

04:46.495 --> 04:48.287
What was it doing
inside your tent?

04:48.372 --> 04:49.872
It was staring at me.

04:50.624 --> 04:53.709
Then it came at me, so I hit it
and it ran off into the jungle.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.045
With your tarp.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.422
Perhaps he wanted to go camping.

04:59.091 --> 05:00.424
You enjoying yourself?

05:01.718 --> 05:03.386
Yes.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.889
Well...

05:07.599 --> 05:09.392
Laugh it up, Mohammed.

05:10.769 --> 05:14.730
But I come back and find my
stuff's gone, I'm coming after you.

05:30.372 --> 05:31.664
What did you hear?

05:33.959 --> 05:37.586
After you ran into the Frenchwoman,
you heard something in the jungle.

05:39.214 --> 05:41.007
I was injured
and I was exhausted.

05:41.091 --> 05:43.551
- My mind was playing tricks.
- What did you hear?

05:45.887 --> 05:48.305
I thought I heard whispering.

05:50.267 --> 05:51.809
What was it saying?

05:52.811 --> 05:56.355
Why? Did you hear something?

06:01.028 --> 06:02.445
Forget it.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.071
I didn't hear anything.

06:17.002 --> 06:19.003
What are you so afraid of?

06:20.130 --> 06:22.465
You're the one trembling,
sweetness.

06:32.642 --> 06:35.102
OK, this is really awkward.

06:36.605 --> 06:39.231
But if I don't say something now,

06:39.316 --> 06:41.901
things are liable to get
downright embarrassing.

06:41.985 --> 06:45.237
- Hibbs.
- Hello, Sawyer.

06:45.322 --> 06:46.655
Ma'am, I must apologize.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.366
I figured my good friend
Sawyer here would be alone.

06:49.451 --> 06:51.577
I just need a few minutes.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.039
- Listen, baby...
- Baby, who is this?

06:55.123 --> 06:58.084
Listen. You go down to the bar.
You get a drink.

06:58.168 --> 06:59.668
I don't want to leave you.

06:59.753 --> 07:02.588
As soon as I get rid of him,
then I'll come get you

07:02.672 --> 07:04.256
and I'll explain everything.

07:04.341 --> 07:08.135
- But...
- Listen. Just trust me on this.

07:08.220 --> 07:10.971
I will find you. I promise.

07:14.017 --> 07:15.684
I got to hand it to you, Sawbucks

07:15.769 --> 07:18.687
how you find women that beautiful
to work your grift.

07:20.899 --> 07:23.442
Now, if I'm not mistaken,
I'm fairly certain

07:23.527 --> 07:25.820
I said I'd kill you
if I ever saw you again.

07:25.904 --> 07:28.781
That's why I'm here.
To make things right.

07:28.865 --> 07:32.201
Besides, we both know
you ain't the killing type.

07:41.753 --> 07:43.337
Here.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.632
Figure that makes us even
for the Tampa job.

07:46.716 --> 07:50.386
What could possibly make us
even for the Tampa job?

07:51.388 --> 07:54.682
How about the known whereabouts
of the man who ruined your life?

07:55.851 --> 07:59.311
I'm gonna make myself a drink.
You want one?

07:59.396 --> 08:01.647
You remember
old man Parks, right?

08:01.731 --> 08:04.275
Ran capper for us
on that gig in Atlanta?

08:04.359 --> 08:06.068
Yeah, what about him?

08:06.153 --> 08:08.904
He's been working at
an off-track parlor in Sydney.

08:09.865 --> 08:12.241
So last week,
one of his regulars

08:12.325 --> 08:16.078
gets too sauced, runs his mouth off
about his glory days as a grifter.

08:18.248 --> 08:19.623
That guy. Frank Duckett.

08:19.708 --> 08:22.126
Hard-luck case,
gambling addict, alcoholic.

08:22.210 --> 08:25.004
Runs a shrimp truck.

08:25.088 --> 08:28.591
Back in the day, this guy Duckett
was quite the hustler.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.509
He ran the romance angle.

08:30.594 --> 08:32.970
Hook the wife,
take the husband for the money.

08:33.513 --> 08:36.097
Was pretty good at it too,
from what I hear.

08:36.183 --> 08:39.268
Until sadly one of his marks
in despair

08:39.352 --> 08:43.063
took a gun, shot up his wife
and blew his own head off.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.691
All in front of their little boy.

08:46.568 --> 08:48.652
I paid Tony to pull his jacket.

08:48.737 --> 08:51.530
Turns out Frank Duckett
used to be named Frank Sawyer,

08:51.615 --> 08:54.033
a name I believe
you appropriated for yourself.

09:01.333 --> 09:02.625
This is him?

09:03.251 --> 09:04.960
That's him.

09:17.849 --> 09:19.058
Thanks for the loaner.

09:20.310 --> 09:21.352
Always a pleasure.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.065
Is anyone curious
where they came from?

09:26.149 --> 09:30.319
They knew there was a marshal.
They assumed he was traveling alone,

09:30.403 --> 09:32.655
protecting them from terrorists.

09:35.158 --> 09:36.742
Sounds like a good theory to me.

09:42.123 --> 09:44.541
- Did you get all the guns back?
- All except one.

09:45.293 --> 09:46.710
Who?

09:46.795 --> 09:48.629
How about I give you
three guesses?

09:48.713 --> 09:52.007
Sawyer. I can get it back.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.133
Really.

09:53.218 --> 09:54.969
How are you gonna do that?

09:55.053 --> 09:56.887
Speak his language.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.933
You've done this before,
and if I remember it right,

10:01.017 --> 10:02.393
you made out with him,

10:02.477 --> 10:05.104
and he never even had
what you said you could get.

10:05.188 --> 10:09.149
Well, I only made out with him
because torturing him didn't work.

10:12.070 --> 10:14.113
Let him keep the gun.
It's not worth it.

10:14.197 --> 10:16.115
Worried he's gonna
shoot me if I ask?

10:16.199 --> 10:18.325
I just don't want you
to owe him anything.

10:29.087 --> 10:31.380
- Hey.
- Hi.

10:45.437 --> 10:47.104
How you feeling?

10:48.023 --> 10:49.940
Very pregnant.

10:54.112 --> 10:56.530
I had some dreams last night.

10:56.614 --> 10:59.491
Actually, more like memories.

11:00.952 --> 11:01.994
You were in them.

11:02.662 --> 11:03.912
Sorry.

11:04.914 --> 11:07.624
Thought I'd see if you wanted
to go for a walk.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.462
Sorry.

11:11.546 --> 11:13.339
I have to...

11:13.423 --> 11:14.465
...do something.

11:15.508 --> 11:16.800
Sure.

11:16.885 --> 11:19.386
See you later, OK?

11:54.839 --> 11:57.299
It'll come back around.

12:26.162 --> 12:27.913
Son of a bitch!

12:27.997 --> 12:30.541
A boar did all this?

12:30.625 --> 12:32.876
Last night, it wrecked my tent.

12:32.961 --> 12:35.254
This morning, when I went
to get my tent back,

12:35.338 --> 12:36.755
it attacks me from behind,

12:36.840 --> 12:39.591
runs off into the jungle
like a coward.

12:39.676 --> 12:43.387
A boar wouldn't just
attack you for no reason.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.931
Thank you, boar expert.

12:46.015 --> 12:48.308
This one did.

12:48.393 --> 12:49.977
It's harassing me.

12:52.939 --> 12:54.273
What are you doing?

12:54.983 --> 12:57.484
- Getting even.
- Would you listen to yourself?

12:57.569 --> 12:58.986
It's a boar.

12:59.070 --> 13:01.029
Just go tell Locke,
and he'll kill it.

13:01.114 --> 13:04.867
- Nope. This is my fight.
- Do you know about hunting boar?

13:04.951 --> 13:08.745
You are gonna
get yourself lost or worse.

13:08.830 --> 13:11.623
- Since when do you care?
- I don't.

13:11.708 --> 13:15.878
Good. Then if you'll excuse me,
I've got some revenge to tend to.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.950
You must be Hibbs' mate.

13:48.411 --> 13:51.163
I did a few jobs with Hibbs
back in the States.

13:52.123 --> 13:54.958
- Nice enough fella.
- He's a son of a bitch.

13:55.043 --> 13:57.336
Right. Indeed he is.

13:57.420 --> 13:59.046
A few disclaimers.

13:59.130 --> 14:02.049
Australia doesn't allow
its citizens to carry handguns.

14:02.133 --> 14:03.675
You get nicked with this...

14:03.760 --> 14:05.052
I'm not gonna rat you out.

14:08.264 --> 14:11.016
Secondly, you know,
I've been doing this for a while,

14:11.100 --> 14:15.562
and a man who buys a compact .357
with hollow-point loads,

14:15.647 --> 14:17.689
he's not looking
to scare or steal.

14:17.774 --> 14:20.108
He's looking to kill.
When it comes down to it,

14:20.193 --> 14:22.986
if he finds he doesn't have
what it takes to do the job...

14:23.571 --> 14:25.489
Your sales pitch
needs some work.

14:25.573 --> 14:27.699
What I'm saying is,

14:27.784 --> 14:30.035
you look a man in the eye
and point a gun at him,

14:30.119 --> 14:31.578
you find who you really are.

14:32.664 --> 14:34.790
And should you find
you're not a killer,

14:34.874 --> 14:36.959
there's no refund.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.294
It won't be a problem.

14:45.593 --> 14:48.679
Hurley, I appreciate the help,

14:48.763 --> 14:50.430
but you don't have to...

14:50.515 --> 14:52.849
I killed Ethan.
I can bury him.

14:52.934 --> 14:55.811
Yeah, until he rises
from the dead.

14:57.355 --> 14:59.690
Dude, I know how this works.
This is gonna end

14:59.774 --> 15:03.110
with you and me running through
the jungle, screaming and crying.

15:03.194 --> 15:07.155
He catches me first
because I'm heavy and I get cramps.

15:21.838 --> 15:23.380
Are you all right?

15:37.604 --> 15:39.438
Can I ask you a question?

15:39.522 --> 15:40.731
Of course.

15:40.815 --> 15:43.358
Did you ever get
that Gulf War Syndrome?

15:44.152 --> 15:47.195
- That was the other side.
- Oh, right.

15:50.033 --> 15:52.909
Then what's the one
where you're all shell-shocked?

15:52.994 --> 15:56.288
- Post-traumatic stress disorder.
- Yeah. Did you ever have that?

15:56.372 --> 15:57.456
Why do you ask?

15:58.124 --> 16:01.418
- I'm worried about Charlie.
- What's wrong with Charlie?

16:01.502 --> 16:05.047
I mean, he killed a guy.
He shot him in the chest four times.

16:05.757 --> 16:08.467
Maybe you should talk to him?

16:24.275 --> 16:25.525
It's a footprint.

16:27.862 --> 16:30.572
Based on the weight and the distance
between strides,

16:30.657 --> 16:34.451
- I'd say you've been following Boone.
- Look.

16:34.535 --> 16:35.952
Could be Charlie, I suppose.

16:36.037 --> 16:38.413
I'm tickled you have
an interest in my affairs.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.332
I really am.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.584
Don't take it personal
when I tell you to...

16:42.669 --> 16:44.002
I want carte blanche.

16:44.671 --> 16:45.962
- What?
- It's simple.

16:46.047 --> 16:48.131
You can't track
this boar without help.

16:48.633 --> 16:52.094
Over the last few hours you
have managed to follow the tracks

16:52.178 --> 16:55.514
of humans, birds,
a rock slide, yourself...

16:55.598 --> 16:58.809
Basically everything except boar.

16:58.893 --> 17:01.436
You have no idea
what you're doing.

17:02.188 --> 17:04.146
- Carte blanche...
- "Blank check."

17:04.232 --> 17:07.192
- I know what it means.
- Anytime I want something from you,

17:07.276 --> 17:10.319
medicine, soap, whatever,
I get it, no questions asked.

17:12.781 --> 17:14.866
Take it or leave it.

17:19.955 --> 17:21.748
All right.

17:21.833 --> 17:23.625
You got a deal.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.725
- Where'd you get that?
- The plane.

17:39.809 --> 17:41.893
Jack was looking
for the liquor cart.

17:41.978 --> 17:44.646
It's a good thing
I found it instead, then.

17:47.650 --> 17:50.360
- Got any more of those?
- I got a lot more of everything,

17:50.445 --> 17:52.279
but you ain't got
carte blanche yet.

17:53.489 --> 17:54.823
Is that a no?

17:57.452 --> 17:59.494
All right, sassafras.

18:01.247 --> 18:04.916
But if you want a drink,
you gotta play.

18:05.001 --> 18:07.377
- Play what?
- I never.

18:07.462 --> 18:08.462
What?

18:10.131 --> 18:11.256
I never.

18:11.340 --> 18:14.176
Am I supposed to know
what that means?

18:16.471 --> 18:19.264
Call it a way to get to know
each other better.

18:20.725 --> 18:22.017
For example,

18:22.101 --> 18:25.353
- I know you've never been to college.
- And how do you know that?

18:25.438 --> 18:27.522
If you had,
you'd have heard of "I never."

18:29.358 --> 18:30.358
It's simple.

18:30.443 --> 18:34.112
You say "I never," and then
you finish the sentence.

18:34.197 --> 18:36.072
If it's something you did,
you drink.

18:36.157 --> 18:38.575
If it's something you
never did, you don't drink.

18:38.659 --> 18:40.869
That makes absolutely no sense.

18:40.953 --> 18:43.455
Learn by example.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.249
I never kissed a man.

18:48.044 --> 18:50.253
Now you drink,

18:50.338 --> 18:51.755
'cause you've kissed a man.

18:55.343 --> 18:56.760
Your turn.

18:59.889 --> 19:02.724
I never implied
that I've been to college

19:02.809 --> 19:04.893
when I never have.

19:10.274 --> 19:11.900
I never been to Disneyland.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.070
Oh, that's just sad.

19:19.408 --> 19:21.451
I never wore pink.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.790
I knew it.

19:27.375 --> 19:28.750
The '80s.

19:30.586 --> 19:32.003
I never voted Democrat.

19:32.088 --> 19:33.463
I never voted.

19:41.764 --> 19:43.181
I've never been in love.

19:44.433 --> 19:47.936
- You've never been in love.
- I ain't drinking, am I?

19:55.152 --> 19:57.153
I've never had
a one-night stand.

20:00.783 --> 20:02.659
Bottom's up, sailor.

20:04.954 --> 20:07.038
- I gotta drink for each one.
- Your turn.

20:08.791 --> 20:10.250
I never been married.

20:15.590 --> 20:17.007
It didn't last very long.

20:21.012 --> 20:23.555
I've never blamed a boar
for all my problems.

20:31.689 --> 20:34.566
I never cared
about having carte blanche

20:34.650 --> 20:36.735
'cause I just wanted
to spend some time

20:36.819 --> 20:41.573
with the only other person
on this island that just don't belong.

20:51.626 --> 20:54.127
I never carried
a letter around for 20 years

20:54.211 --> 20:56.838
because I couldn't
get over my baggage.

21:14.065 --> 21:16.733
I never killed a man.

21:46.055 --> 21:47.222
Well...

21:49.183 --> 21:51.935
...it looks like we got something
in common after all.

22:16.711 --> 22:18.253
It'll come back around.

22:22.758 --> 22:23.758
Are you OK?

22:24.802 --> 22:26.636
You're shaking.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.643
I'm fine.

22:33.728 --> 22:35.478
I was just having a...

22:43.029 --> 22:45.447
I can't believe this.

22:45.531 --> 22:47.323
There are hoof marks everywhere.

22:49.326 --> 22:50.618
It ate all our stuff?

22:50.703 --> 22:54.289
Nope. It ate your stuff. Mine's fine.

22:55.916 --> 22:58.209
Oh, that hog is gonna suffer.

22:58.294 --> 23:00.003
I swear to God...

23:10.431 --> 23:11.431
Morning.

23:16.645 --> 23:18.313
What happened to your campsite?

23:21.859 --> 23:24.152
So, what are you doing
all the way out here?

23:24.236 --> 23:27.322
- Looking for salvage from the crash.
- Find anything useful?

23:27.406 --> 23:31.409
The occasional scrap of metal,
two bags of coffee.

23:31.494 --> 23:34.537
I picked up your path a mile back.
I thought I'd say howdy.

23:35.081 --> 23:37.540
Oh, son of a...

23:37.625 --> 23:40.126
Peed on my shirt.
Took my shirt out of the bag

23:40.211 --> 23:42.587
and peed on it.
And you say this ain't personal.

23:42.671 --> 23:45.799
He thinks the boar we're after
has a vendetta against him.

23:46.926 --> 23:48.843
That's three times it's attacked me.

23:48.928 --> 23:52.222
Maybe it's got your scent.
Doesn't like your cologne.

23:52.306 --> 23:55.850
- I don't wear cologne.
- Yes, you do.

23:57.770 --> 24:00.188
Yeah, well...

24:00.272 --> 24:03.358
- The thing's got it in for me!
- It's a boar, Sawyer.

24:05.820 --> 24:09.155
My sister Jeannie died
when I was a boy.

24:11.867 --> 24:14.744
She fell off the monkey bars
and broke her neck.

24:14.829 --> 24:17.872
And my mother,
well, my foster mother,

24:17.957 --> 24:20.083
she blamed herself, of course.

24:20.167 --> 24:22.585
Thought she wasn't
watching close enough.

24:22.670 --> 24:27.257
So she stopped eating,
stopped sleeping.

24:27.341 --> 24:29.300
The neighbors started talking,

24:29.385 --> 24:31.970
afraid she might do something
to herself, I guess.

24:32.888 --> 24:34.222
That's good.

24:37.226 --> 24:40.812
Anyway, about six months
after Jeannie's funeral,

24:40.896 --> 24:43.314
this golden retriever
comes up our driveway,

24:43.399 --> 24:46.860
walks right into our house,
sits down on the floor

24:46.944 --> 24:49.362
and looks right at my mother
there on the couch.

24:49.446 --> 24:51.322
And my mother
looks back at the dog.

24:51.407 --> 24:54.742
After about a minute of this,
them staring at each other like that,

24:54.827 --> 24:59.122
my mother... burst into tears.

25:00.708 --> 25:03.293
Beautiful dog, no tags, no collar.

25:03.377 --> 25:05.545
Healthy and sweet.

25:07.173 --> 25:10.842
The dog slept in Jeannie's old room
on Jeannie's old bed

25:10.926 --> 25:14.721
and stayed with us until
my mother passed five years later,

25:14.805 --> 25:16.931
then disappeared back to...

25:18.142 --> 25:21.227
...wherever it was she came from
in the first place.

25:23.355 --> 25:26.316
So you're saying the dog
was your sister?

25:27.818 --> 25:30.153
Well, that would be silly.

25:31.155 --> 25:33.114
But my mother thought it was.

25:33.866 --> 25:36.534
Thought that Jeannie
had come back to tell her

25:36.619 --> 25:39.120
the accident wasn't her fault,

25:39.205 --> 25:41.915
let her off the hook.

26:26.168 --> 26:27.502
You're good to go.

26:37.513 --> 26:39.430
Only two choices:

26:39.515 --> 26:43.017
Shrimp in mild sauce,
shrimp in hot sauce.

26:52.236 --> 26:53.236
Pal?

26:58.951 --> 27:00.785
I'll go with the hot.

27:02.079 --> 27:03.955
Hot it is.

27:11.839 --> 27:13.923
A fellow American?

27:14.008 --> 27:16.884
Good for you.
You missed the lunch rush.

27:21.223 --> 27:22.724
Whereabouts you from?

27:26.061 --> 27:27.103
Tennessee.

27:27.187 --> 27:29.897
Yeah, I love the South.

27:30.941 --> 27:32.900
Miss those Southern women.

27:36.280 --> 27:37.530
Been in Australia long?

27:39.742 --> 27:40.742
Not really.

27:40.826 --> 27:44.495
For what it's worth,
we have a special at the truck here,

27:44.580 --> 27:47.457
half-price for all Americans.

27:56.717 --> 27:58.134
Name's Frank, by the way.

28:01.680 --> 28:02.889
James.

28:03.766 --> 28:05.516
Good to meet you, James.

28:19.615 --> 28:21.741
One shrimp in hot sauce...

28:34.505 --> 28:37.298
- Again.
- Are you sure about that, mate?

28:39.301 --> 28:42.387
- Again.
- You tell him, cowboy.

28:42.471 --> 28:46.099
These bastards think Americans
can't hold their liquor.

28:48.102 --> 28:49.894
Look, I...

28:49.978 --> 28:51.479
...I hate to hold my hand out,

28:51.563 --> 28:54.357
but I seem to have
misplaced my wallet.

28:56.151 --> 28:57.693
Set him up.

28:59.029 --> 29:00.863
I drink to you.

29:01.657 --> 29:04.534
- What's your name, cowboy?
- Sawyer.

29:04.618 --> 29:06.702
To Sawyer.

29:06.787 --> 29:10.748
May he find whatever he's looking for
at the bottom of a glass.

29:15.421 --> 29:17.547
So, Sawyer,

29:17.631 --> 29:20.216
what brings you to Sydney?

29:22.428 --> 29:23.928
Business.

29:27.558 --> 29:31.227
You know why they call Australia
"down under," don't you?

29:31.311 --> 29:33.938
Because it's as close
as you can get to hell

29:34.022 --> 29:35.731
without being burned.

29:41.363 --> 29:43.281
How about you leave
the bottle, Slim?

29:53.167 --> 29:56.461
So, what's your handle
back in the States?

29:58.881 --> 30:01.174
I was a...

30:01.258 --> 30:02.633
...chief of surgery.

30:02.718 --> 30:03.843
Was?

30:05.053 --> 30:07.221
Yeah, I was.

30:09.224 --> 30:11.601
So we're in hell?

30:11.685 --> 30:14.020
Don't let the air conditioning
fool you, son.

30:14.104 --> 30:15.938
You are here too.

30:16.023 --> 30:18.483
And you are suffering.

30:21.737 --> 30:25.323
But don't beat
yourself up about it.

30:25.407 --> 30:26.991
It's fate.

30:27.075 --> 30:29.494
Some people are just
supposed to suffer.

30:31.497 --> 30:34.207
That's why the Red Sox
will never win the damn Series.

30:42.633 --> 30:46.427
I have a son,
he's about your age.

30:48.263 --> 30:50.473
He's not like me.

30:51.308 --> 30:53.226
He does what's in his heart.

30:54.561 --> 30:56.229
He's a good man.

30:57.272 --> 30:59.106
Maybe a great one.

31:03.445 --> 31:05.905
And right now,

31:05.989 --> 31:07.490
he thinks that I hate him.

31:09.952 --> 31:12.995
He thinks I feel
betrayed by him.

31:14.039 --> 31:16.332
But what I really feel

31:16.416 --> 31:18.626
is gratitude

31:18.710 --> 31:20.962
and pride

31:21.046 --> 31:23.339
because of what he did to me.

31:24.633 --> 31:26.926
What he did for me.

31:28.595 --> 31:30.638
It took more courage than I have.

31:34.142 --> 31:37.019
There's a pay phone over here.

31:37.104 --> 31:39.981
I could pick it up,
and I could call my son.

31:42.693 --> 31:45.570
I could tell him about all of this.

31:45.654 --> 31:48.114
I could tell him that I love him.

31:49.241 --> 31:52.743
One simple phone call,
and I could fix everything.

31:52.828 --> 31:54.704
Then why don't you?

31:54.788 --> 31:58.499
Because I am weak.

32:07.259 --> 32:08.926
This...

32:09.011 --> 32:12.013
This business that you have,

32:12.097 --> 32:13.889
will it ease your suffering?

32:17.144 --> 32:21.063
- Yeah.
- Then what are you doing here?

32:24.067 --> 32:26.861
- It ain't that simple.
- Of course it is.

32:28.030 --> 32:31.741
Unless you want to end up
like me, of course it is.

33:11.365 --> 33:13.783
You're developing quite a talent.

33:13.867 --> 33:15.117
Yeah.

33:25.504 --> 33:27.296
I get it.

33:27.381 --> 33:29.632
You're here
to check up on me.

33:30.425 --> 33:31.676
You killed a man.

33:32.969 --> 33:34.970
A man who killed one of us.

33:35.055 --> 33:38.015
Who kidnapped Claire.
Who strung me up and left me for dead.

33:38.100 --> 33:39.850
He deserved to die.

33:39.935 --> 33:41.519
I'd do it again in a minute.

33:41.603 --> 33:43.604
Pardon me if I'm out
of bad feeling.

33:48.777 --> 33:52.113
When I was in the army
in Tikrit in Iraq,

33:52.197 --> 33:55.074
the man who lived
next door was a policeman.

33:55.158 --> 33:57.201
One day his car
was rigged with a bomb.

33:57.786 --> 34:00.579
It killed his wife
and three young children instead.

34:01.164 --> 34:03.249
They caught
the man who did it.

34:03.959 --> 34:05.960
I volunteered to be
on the firing squad,

34:06.044 --> 34:08.629
and I did my duty without
a single ounce of remorse.

34:10.340 --> 34:14.051
Then for no reason,
I found myself waking up at night,

34:14.136 --> 34:16.554
replaying what I did
in my head.

34:18.098 --> 34:20.349
Looks like you're
who needs checking up on.

34:22.393 --> 34:24.103
What happened with Ethan

34:24.187 --> 34:26.731
will be with you
for the rest of your life.

34:35.614 --> 34:37.533
Any suggestions?

34:37.617 --> 34:39.577
You're not alone.

34:44.875 --> 34:46.958
Don't pretend to be.

34:55.010 --> 34:57.428
I take comfort knowing someday

34:57.512 --> 35:00.723
this is all gonna be
a real nice shopping complex.

35:00.807 --> 35:02.850
Maybe even an auto mall.

35:02.934 --> 35:04.602
Where you going?

35:04.686 --> 35:07.438
Know what that is?

35:07.522 --> 35:08.981
A hole in the mud.

35:09.065 --> 35:11.609
- It's a wallow.
- What the hell's a wallow?

35:11.693 --> 35:14.862
Boar's wallow.
It's his den where he sleeps.

35:14.946 --> 35:17.531
Look at these tree rubbings
from his tusks.

35:18.200 --> 35:21.035
- You mean he's around here?
- Maybe.

35:26.374 --> 35:27.792
Wait. Sawyer!

35:29.211 --> 35:30.711
Gotcha.

35:33.882 --> 35:36.133
- I thought it'd be bigger.
- Funny.

35:36.218 --> 35:38.135
We know daddy's
got to be around here.

35:38.220 --> 35:40.054
Here, piggy, piggy, piggy!

35:40.138 --> 35:41.806
Put it down!
That's not funny!

35:41.890 --> 35:43.307
Here, piggy, piggy, piggy!

35:43.391 --> 35:45.392
Hey, what is the matter with you?

35:45.477 --> 35:46.936
- You'll hurt it!
- Over here!

35:47.020 --> 35:49.230
- Not funny!
- Here, piggy...

35:51.024 --> 35:52.983
You're sick.

35:53.068 --> 35:54.568
I didn't hurt it.

35:54.653 --> 35:56.904
Find your own way home.

35:59.950 --> 36:01.659
No problem!

36:15.298 --> 36:17.091
Sawyer.

36:25.433 --> 36:26.976
I got a letter for you.

36:39.781 --> 36:41.949
- "Dear Mr. Sawyer..."
- Who?

36:44.369 --> 36:46.245
You used to go
by the name of Sawyer.

36:47.789 --> 36:50.875
What the hell are you
talking about?

36:52.544 --> 36:54.336
You didn't have to.

36:54.421 --> 36:57.256
Tell Hibbs I would have paid.

36:57.966 --> 36:59.925
How do you know Hibbs?

37:02.470 --> 37:03.888
You don't...

37:03.972 --> 37:06.056
You don't know
what you're doing, do you?

37:07.100 --> 37:10.519
You borrowed money from Hibbs?

37:12.480 --> 37:14.607
I was gonna pay.

37:22.324 --> 37:25.242
It'll come back around.

39:05.135 --> 39:07.594
It's just a boar.

39:08.638 --> 39:10.931
Let's get back to camp.

39:31.494 --> 39:33.829
Go get it! Go, Vincent! Go get it!

39:48.636 --> 39:50.137
Here we go.

39:53.850 --> 39:59.563
Hey.

40:00.815 --> 40:02.316
Want to take that walk now?

40:04.486 --> 40:05.903
Sure.

40:34.432 --> 40:36.016
Stick 'em up.

40:42.440 --> 40:43.774
Trying to be funny?

40:46.069 --> 40:47.402
Yeah.

40:49.072 --> 40:51.448
I was fresh out of pies
to throw at you.

40:54.035 --> 40:55.911
Here you go, sheriff.

40:56.746 --> 40:59.873
- I asked you for this two days ago.
- And I told you to stick it.

41:01.543 --> 41:03.919
But I made a deal
with your girlfriend.

41:04.003 --> 41:05.295
What did she give you?

41:07.132 --> 41:09.174
Kate. What did she give you?

41:11.553 --> 41:14.012
Nothing she wasn't willing
to part with.

41:16.182 --> 41:18.433
That's why the Sox
will never win the Series.

41:19.894 --> 41:21.311
What's that?

41:22.772 --> 41:24.022
What'd you just say?

41:24.732 --> 41:27.568
I said that's why the Red Sox
will never win the Series.

41:28.069 --> 41:29.653
What's that supposed to mean?

41:29.737 --> 41:32.698
It's just something
my father used to say

41:33.575 --> 41:37.077
so he could go through life
knowing that people hated him.

41:37.162 --> 41:40.998
Instead of taking responsibility for it,
he just put it on fate.

41:41.708 --> 41:43.792
Said he was made that way.

41:45.545 --> 41:47.296
Your daddy,

41:47.380 --> 41:48.547
he a doctor too?

41:51.009 --> 41:52.593
Was.

41:53.511 --> 41:55.137
He's dead.

42:00.935 --> 42:03.437
Why do you want to know
about my father?

42:15.158 --> 42:17.242
No reason.
