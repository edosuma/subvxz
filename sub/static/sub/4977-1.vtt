04:18.507 --> 04:20.009
James!

04:20.093 --> 04:21.677
She let you go then?

04:21.762 --> 04:23.763
Yeah.

04:50.499 --> 04:52.375
Afraid of nobody.

04:59.049 --> 05:02.218
I wish you could see into my heart, James,
and know that, this very night...

05:02.302 --> 05:06.138
I am going to repent of all my sins.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.585
- What's that?
-  They're leaving Harvard.

05:59.151 --> 06:01.027
You're hungover.

06:21.757 --> 06:25.342
James! James!
Where are we supposed to be?

06:25.427 --> 06:26.927
Here?

06:46.573 --> 06:48.324
My friends...

06:49.910 --> 06:52.369
if it be not a mere farce -

06:56.166 --> 07:01.504
If it be not a mere farce
you are enacting...

07:01.588 --> 07:04.673
in these sacred valedictory rites...

07:07.344 --> 07:11.680
if you mean them, feel them -

07:11.765 --> 07:14.433
as I know you do...

07:14.518 --> 07:19.688
they have for you a mandate
of imperative duty.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.733
Hallelujah!

07:30.242 --> 07:34.620
It is not great wealth alone...

07:34.704 --> 07:37.915
that builds the library...

07:37.999 --> 07:40.543
founds the college...

07:40.627 --> 07:45.714
that is to diffuse a high learning
and culture among a people.

07:48.969 --> 07:52.221
It is the contact...

07:52.305 --> 07:56.642
of the cultivated mind
with the uncultivated.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.646
If it be true...

08:02.399 --> 08:07.027
that the constitution
of American society...

08:07.112 --> 08:11.574
is peculiarly hostile now...

08:11.658 --> 08:15.828
to all habits of thought
and meditation...

08:15.912 --> 08:18.372
it doubly behooves us -

08:29.759 --> 08:33.095
It doubly behooves us...

08:33.179 --> 08:36.557
to look well
to the influence we may exert.

08:36.640 --> 08:39.977
A high ideal -

08:40.061 --> 08:42.813
the education of a nation.

09:05.212 --> 09:08.005
CIass of '70...

09:08.089 --> 09:11.383
friends, parents...

09:11.468 --> 09:13.844
relations of the class of '70...

09:13.929 --> 09:19.308
I now introduce your class orator -

09:19.392 --> 09:21.143
Mr. William C. Irvine.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.563
Oh!

09:25.232 --> 09:27.691
James! Onward!

09:42.249 --> 09:43.749
William.

09:50.674 --> 09:52.675
Give us a good one, Bill!

09:57.472 --> 10:00.266
CIass of '70...

10:03.311 --> 10:05.104
ladies and gentlemen...

10:08.316 --> 10:10.109
friends of the class of '70...

10:11.736 --> 10:13.445
That's your friend.

10:13.530 --> 10:19.368
There is a story
told by an ancient author...

10:19.452 --> 10:23.789
of a young man who being noticed
by his friend to look dejected...

10:23.873 --> 10:25.582
was questioned by him...

10:25.667 --> 10:28.460
concerning the cause
of his troubled appearance.

10:30.422 --> 10:33.299
The youth used no concealment...

10:33.383 --> 10:35.217
but told him that, for three days...

10:35.302 --> 10:38.470
he had been vainly endeavoring
with his utmost efforts...

10:38.555 --> 10:42.891
to find an exordium for a subject
on which he had to write.

10:45.812 --> 10:50.441
Whereupon,
his friend replied with a smile...

10:50.525 --> 10:53.736
"Do you wish to write
better than you can?"

10:56.072 --> 11:00.242
"And such," says the old author,
"is the whole truth of the matter.

11:00.952 --> 11:05.581
We must endeavor to speak
to the best of our ability...

11:05.665 --> 11:10.919
but we must speak
according to our ability."

11:16.092 --> 11:18.677
Oh. He keeps looking at you.

11:20.388 --> 11:23.307
And similar to the distress of this youth
was my own trouble...

11:23.391 --> 11:27.936
when upon examining the old skeleton
upon which most college orations are hung -

11:29.647 --> 11:34.026
I considered how I might incarnate
that familiar framework.

11:35.445 --> 11:40.115
Of course, I at once decided
not to attempt any profound...

11:40.200 --> 11:41.992
or difficult matter...

11:42.077 --> 11:45.996
lest having given the dry bones
at best but a long tongue -

11:51.836 --> 11:53.128
puny strength.

11:58.051 --> 12:02.179
And after much careful
and calm meditation...

12:02.263 --> 12:05.307
the class has refused to advise alteration...

12:05.392 --> 12:08.560
on the usual law
that is called gravitation.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.563
Though we had thought at one time
of having it stopped...

12:11.648 --> 12:14.024
in order that some of us
might not be dropped.

12:18.446 --> 12:23.033
But the mind of mankind
perha
