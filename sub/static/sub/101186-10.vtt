WEBVTT

00:08.175 --> 00:10.277
(Doc): Wanna tell everyone
you're not here to kill them?

00:10.310 --> 00:12.112
‐ Yeah, not everyone.

00:12.145 --> 00:13.313
Since Wynonna shot Holt,
she's off the chain.

00:13.347 --> 00:14.314
‐ Missed you too.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.682
‐ You will all die!

00:15.716 --> 00:17.818
‐ Welcome home, little brother.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.353
It's time we took back
what's ours.

00:19.386 --> 00:21.054
The Clantons turned him into
that thing

00:21.088 --> 00:22.422
and you said we'd fix him.

00:22.456 --> 00:24.491
(Wynonna): That fog at the edge
of the Triangle,

00:24.525 --> 00:26.493
where's it coming from?
‐ Best guess? The Garden.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.629
‐ Oh noooooo!

00:28.662 --> 00:30.130
(Ginny): I could make him
love you again.

00:30.163 --> 00:32.065
‐ Where ya been?
I'm poison too.

00:32.099 --> 00:34.134
‐ With a psychotic gun for
a master.

00:34.167 --> 00:36.904
You hypocrite.

00:37.671 --> 00:41.008
(country‐pop music)

00:41.041 --> 00:42.376
(soft groan)

00:42.409 --> 00:43.510
‐ Hm.

00:53.387 --> 00:55.088
(Peacemaker whooshing)

00:55.122 --> 00:56.957
(growling)
(gunshot)

00:59.660 --> 01:01.194
(groaning)

01:06.900 --> 01:08.468
(growling)

01:08.502 --> 01:09.436
(gunshot)

01:11.271 --> 01:12.606
(soft groan)

01:16.209 --> 01:17.444
Ha!

01:19.546 --> 01:20.948
(growling)

01:21.648 --> 01:22.950
(moaning)

01:34.928 --> 01:36.296
Unh!

01:36.330 --> 01:37.497
(groaning)

01:40.267 --> 01:43.437
(panting)

01:44.605 --> 01:46.440
Oh, fuckity fuck.

01:46.473 --> 01:49.576
Yo, fiancée as cute as Beyoncé!

01:49.610 --> 01:52.446
We gots a probs. Heh.

01:54.648 --> 01:56.116
No coffee? No doughnuts?

01:56.149 --> 01:57.484
What kind of cop are you?

01:58.318 --> 02:00.454
‐ BBD officially stopped
sending in supply trucks

02:00.487 --> 02:03.457
so every store in Purgatory is
pretty low, Earp.

02:03.490 --> 02:05.459
‐ So, listen.

02:05.492 --> 02:07.527
Funny story, I kinda...

02:09.262 --> 02:10.731
misplaced Peacemaker.

02:10.764 --> 02:12.432
I know what you're thinking

02:12.466 --> 02:14.534
but it was an honest to Gaga
oopsie this time.

02:14.568 --> 02:15.636
‐ Or was it a blackout?

02:16.470 --> 02:17.404
‐ Good one.

02:18.438 --> 02:22.142
Guys. Whatever is going on here,
can we shelve it?

02:22.175 --> 02:23.010
We need to find Peacemaker

02:23.043 --> 02:24.678
before she falls into
the wrong hands.

02:33.553 --> 02:36.056
‐ The first thing
we want to say, Wynonna,

02:36.089 --> 02:40.527
is that
we love you very much...

02:40.560 --> 02:42.362
and this is not an attack.

02:42.396 --> 02:46.199
‐ No. It's worse.
It's a goddamned intervention!

02:46.233 --> 02:50.504
(theme music)

02:50.537 --> 02:53.674
♪ Cause I gave you
all I got to give ♪

02:53.707 --> 02:55.609
♪ I know that ain't
no way to live ♪

02:55.642 --> 03:01.214
♪ But I told that devil
to take you back

03:01.248 --> 03:06.219
♪ I told that devil
to take you back ♪

03:07.187 --> 03:08.689
We're really worried about you.

03:08.722 --> 03:12.225
You're hunting all the time.

03:12.259 --> 03:13.560
You're not really sleeping‐

03:13.593 --> 03:14.628
‐ I'm totally sleeping.

03:14.661 --> 03:15.729
(Nicole): No, you're
passing out.

03:15.762 --> 03:17.397
That's not the same thing.

03:17.431 --> 03:18.298
‐ You're isolating yourself.

03:18.331 --> 03:19.733
‐ No, I'm hunting alone.

03:19.766 --> 03:23.170
So until a new Chosen One rolls
into town...

03:23.203 --> 03:24.538
who's old enough to drink.

03:24.571 --> 03:26.239
(Waverly): Wynonna!

03:26.840 --> 03:29.076
You're so...

03:29.609 --> 03:31.545
you seem so‐‐
‐ Dedicated to keeping

03:31.578 --> 03:33.447
my friends and family safe?

03:34.181 --> 03:35.248
‐ Really sad.

03:36.683 --> 03:37.718
And lonely.

03:40.320 --> 03:43.724
‐ Well, we don't all have the
luxury of happily ever after.

03:43.757 --> 03:44.925
‐ Doc loves you.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.660
(softly): Shut up.

03:48.295 --> 03:49.696
‐ And so do we.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.167
‐ Just keep the stupid gun.

03:58.872 --> 03:59.840
‐ Hey, babe.

04:01.341 --> 04:03.577
‐ Wynonna, stop!
Please!

04:03.610 --> 04:06.580
‐ You want me to admit
I have a problem?

04:06.613 --> 04:09.282
Okay, well here's my problem,
it's a big one.

04:09.316 --> 04:11.318
Uh, if I stop killing demons,

04:11.351 --> 04:13.887
everyone I love, like you,
gets eaten.

04:13.920 --> 04:17.424
‐ Or maybe that's what you've
been telling yourself Wynonna.

04:17.457 --> 04:19.326
Because you like it.

04:19.359 --> 04:20.694
A little too much.

04:20.727 --> 04:22.295
‐ I don't hear anyone else
complaining

04:22.329 --> 04:24.331
about being too not dead,

04:24.364 --> 04:25.632
because I've taken out
too many demons‐‐

04:25.665 --> 04:26.967
‐ What about Holt?
He was human.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.735
‐ Why is it that when you kill
a Clanton,

04:28.769 --> 04:31.238
it's the right thing to do but
when I do it, it's a problem?

04:31.271 --> 04:34.207
‐ You know I really thought
we'd have a couple more years

04:34.241 --> 04:38.278
before your transition from
fun drunk to mean alcoholic.

04:38.311 --> 04:39.312
‐ Have fun planning
your wedding,

04:39.346 --> 04:40.514
you sanctimonious asshole.

04:48.655 --> 04:49.856
‐ Hey.

04:51.558 --> 04:53.660
Once she's done
being defensive,

04:53.693 --> 04:56.663
she's gonna realize
that you're right.

04:56.696 --> 04:58.231
‐ Am I?

04:58.265 --> 04:59.900
I'm not judging her.

05:02.269 --> 05:03.904
I'm just trying not to
lose her.

05:03.937 --> 05:05.472
‐ Hey.

05:11.945 --> 05:13.780
You want me to stay?

05:15.882 --> 05:17.484
‐ No. You gotta go.

05:27.761 --> 05:30.397
(sighing)

05:32.566 --> 05:34.434
(ringing on the line)

05:34.467 --> 05:38.371
Hey, can you meet at our place?

05:39.539 --> 05:41.474
And bring the thing.

05:43.543 --> 05:45.345
Is the book still blank?

05:45.378 --> 05:46.646
‐ As a wet slate.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.382
Keep it.

05:50.417 --> 05:52.886
I don't want Wynonna to find it
and think...

05:54.187 --> 05:56.389
Well, I don't know
what she'd think.

05:57.724 --> 05:59.759
Not after the fight we just
had.

06:00.760 --> 06:01.928
‐ You alright?

06:02.963 --> 06:06.600
‐ Yeah.
But she's not.

06:10.804 --> 06:13.940
I keep hoping that
will have answers.

06:13.974 --> 06:16.276
Wynonna's part of my story.

06:17.043 --> 06:18.545
Big part.

06:18.578 --> 06:19.846
You all are.

06:21.514 --> 06:24.584
That's why I chose my own book.
‐ Smart.

06:24.618 --> 06:26.653
‐ Or was it selfish?

06:27.954 --> 06:29.556
(exhaling loudly)

06:29.589 --> 06:31.958
Why would the Garden offer me
a book we can't read?

06:31.992 --> 06:33.793
‐ That Garden was full of
deceptions.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.829
‐ And if Wynonna hadn't
saved me,

06:36.796 --> 06:37.931
I'd still be in there.

06:37.964 --> 06:40.767
‐ Tormented... for an eternity.

06:40.800 --> 06:41.902
‐ No.

06:43.036 --> 06:45.405
That's not what it was like.

06:45.438 --> 06:48.875
The throne, it took
all my cares away,

06:49.709 --> 06:51.611
for everyone and
everything.

06:52.879 --> 06:53.847
‐ Sounds like hell.

06:53.880 --> 06:55.382
‐ It was like heaven.

06:57.617 --> 06:59.419
Is that what it's like
to be an angel?

06:59.452 --> 07:01.221
‐ Well,

07:01.254 --> 07:05.458
seems like we're not the only
ones out for a stroll, Remy.

07:05.492 --> 07:06.459
(Remy): Hey, Doc.

07:06.493 --> 07:07.661
Waverly.

07:08.061 --> 07:10.130
‐ I did not peg you
for outdoorsy.

07:10.163 --> 07:11.765
‐ Things change.

07:13.066 --> 07:15.001
‐ There will be no hunting here,
Dallas.

07:15.035 --> 07:16.436
‐ You're outnumbered, Doc.

07:16.469 --> 07:19.239
Just leave the girl and
we'll let you go.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.074
‐ I expected this kind of
chicanery from him.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.777
But you, Remy?
‐ We're so hungry, Doc.

07:23.810 --> 07:24.978
(gunshot)
‐ Ah!

07:26.279 --> 07:27.814
Ha! Ha!

07:27.847 --> 07:30.951
Not even you can kill me with
a six‐shooter, Holliday.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.652
‐ But I can.

07:32.686 --> 07:33.787
With this.

07:35.722 --> 07:36.790
(clicking)

07:36.823 --> 07:37.624
What?

07:37.657 --> 07:39.859
Come on.
You did it once before!

07:40.293 --> 07:42.028
(clicking)

07:42.062 --> 07:43.730
(soft growling)
‐ Why do you have Wynonna's gun?

07:43.763 --> 07:44.831
‐ It's a long story.

07:44.864 --> 07:46.866
‐ Never mind that.
Run!

07:48.969 --> 07:50.570
(dramatic uptempo music)

07:50.603 --> 07:52.072
(panting)

07:52.105 --> 07:54.007
(whooshing)

07:55.308 --> 07:58.578
(panting)

07:58.611 --> 08:01.448
(eerie dark music)

08:06.753 --> 08:10.690
(distorted, eerie,
soft voice): Waverly...

08:12.058 --> 08:16.730
Waverly...

08:19.599 --> 08:20.767
(panting)

08:20.800 --> 08:22.335
‐ Hello?!

08:27.807 --> 08:29.676
(soft music)

08:29.709 --> 08:32.946
‐ Of all the cabins

08:32.979 --> 08:36.750
in all the world.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.053
‐ Jolene.

08:46.259 --> 08:47.927
You can't be real.

08:47.961 --> 08:49.863
Wynonna shot you.

08:49.896 --> 08:53.633
‐ When Bulshar died,
his vines released me.

08:53.666 --> 08:57.370
But then you opened up
the Garden

08:57.404 --> 09:01.474
and all this fog rolled in,
trapping me here.

09:02.542 --> 09:07.414
But now, after everything that
I have been through,

09:07.447 --> 09:13.286
we are gonna have so much fun.

09:13.319 --> 09:15.455
‐ Like hell we are.

09:15.488 --> 09:16.790
(grunting and screaming)

09:20.360 --> 09:21.494
(grunting)

09:21.528 --> 09:23.196
‐ Waverly ran into the fog!

09:23.229 --> 09:24.864
‐ We are nowhere near
the border.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.266
‐ Told you.
The fog's everywhere now.

09:26.299 --> 09:27.600
‐ Let me tend to Waverly

09:27.634 --> 09:29.969
and I will give you your fill of
everything in The Glory Hole.

09:30.003 --> 09:31.905
Food, libations‐‐
‐ That ain't there anymore.

09:31.938 --> 09:33.807
Black Badge raided it
in the morning,

09:33.840 --> 09:35.241
dragged everyone out.

09:35.275 --> 09:36.843
‐ Then we have more
pressing concerns

09:36.876 --> 09:38.745
than food in our bel‐‐
(arrows whizzing)

09:38.778 --> 09:39.446
(Remy): Ah.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.183
(soft moan)
(man): Targets down.

09:43.216 --> 09:44.884
(soft grunt)
(woman): Moving in.

09:45.752 --> 09:48.421
(growling)

09:48.455 --> 09:49.722
‐ Wow.

09:49.756 --> 09:55.495
Mr. Moustache is a strong one.
‐ I will remember your face.

09:57.697 --> 09:58.998
(man, distorted):
Leave that one.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.200
He's not on the list.

10:00.233 --> 10:01.468
(gunshot)

10:01.501 --> 10:03.803
(uptempo music)
(grunting)

10:08.475 --> 10:11.478
(clicking)
(thudding of punches

10:11.511 --> 10:13.746
‐ 'Sup? You gonna stage
an intervention

10:13.780 --> 10:14.647
on my taste in music?

10:14.681 --> 10:16.649
‐ I'm sorry about what happened
earlier.

10:16.683 --> 10:19.519
‐
Why? Now's as good a time as any
to find out my sister thinks

10:19.552 --> 10:21.621
I'm a chip off the
abusive asshole block.

10:21.654 --> 10:23.456
(punching continues)

10:23.490 --> 10:25.291
What do you want, Rachel?
I'm training.

10:25.325 --> 10:27.260
‐ That's what I wanna do.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.528
Train.

10:28.561 --> 10:29.529
With you.
‐ Yeah, sure.

10:29.562 --> 10:31.931
Obi Wan Wynonny
at your service.

10:31.965 --> 10:34.200
‐ I'm serious.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.904
You're the only one who talks
to me like I'm not a kid.

10:39.405 --> 10:41.708
‐ Purgatory's not a place where
people get to be kids.

10:41.741 --> 10:43.943
‐ Which is why I need
to be able to defend myself.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.713
And you're the only person
around here kicking actual ass.

10:49.549 --> 10:51.651
‐ I must still be drunk cause
it sounds like you're saying‐‐

10:51.684 --> 10:53.386
‐ Please, Wynonna.

10:53.419 --> 10:54.554
Teach me to be like you?

10:55.021 --> 10:56.222
‐ Oof.

10:57.857 --> 10:59.292
(exhaling)

11:00.393 --> 11:01.628
‐ I filled it all out,

11:01.661 --> 11:03.463
in triplicate.
‐ Hm.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.398
‐ Which is bullshit, by the by,

11:05.431 --> 11:07.467
because if anybody should be
allowed out of the Triangle,

11:07.500 --> 11:08.601
it's The Magistrate.

11:08.635 --> 11:10.737
‐ Even people with status
positions

11:10.770 --> 11:12.772
haven't been allowed
to leave lately.

11:12.805 --> 11:14.440
But...
good luck.

11:16.943 --> 11:19.712
(softly): Come on, come on,
hurry up.

11:19.746 --> 11:22.415
(keyboard clicking)
(door creaking)

11:23.583 --> 11:26.719
‐ Oh, heavens,
what is that stench?

11:26.753 --> 11:28.821
‐ Just the universe taking
a giant dump

11:28.855 --> 11:29.923
on my hopes and dreams.

11:31.891 --> 11:34.561
I gave you a whole bus
full of geezer food,

11:34.594 --> 11:35.895
now go eat with
the others!

11:35.929 --> 11:37.230
‐ Oh, I'm sorry.

11:37.263 --> 11:41.935
It says here your mother and
brother were killed recently?

11:41.968 --> 11:44.804
‐ Brothers. And how the hell
does your computer know that?

11:44.837 --> 11:46.439
‐ It knows a lot of things.

11:46.472 --> 11:48.341
(beeping)
(Cleo sighs)

11:48.374 --> 11:51.844
But glass half‐full,
you passed the screening.

11:51.878 --> 11:53.446
You're clear to go through.

11:54.914 --> 11:58.551
It must be awful losing
your whole family like that.

11:58.585 --> 12:00.954
But of course, they always
stay with you.

12:03.823 --> 12:06.326
‐ That's the part that sucks.

12:12.465 --> 12:13.900
(Wynonna): You're doing it
wrong.

12:16.436 --> 12:17.637
I'll help you.

12:17.670 --> 12:18.705
Listen.

12:19.606 --> 12:22.809
What you do is you put on
a skimpy outfit

12:22.842 --> 12:25.044
and then, you pretend you're
lost in the woods.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.046
And then, when the demons
show up to eat you,

12:27.080 --> 12:28.881
zigazig‐ah!

12:28.915 --> 12:30.783
‐ I know what you're doing.
‐ Really?

12:30.817 --> 12:32.452
I barely know what I'm doing.

12:32.485 --> 12:33.720
‐ You're trying to scare me off.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.623
‐ 'Cause you could be anywhere
right now, doing anything,

12:36.656 --> 12:39.759
other than hunkering down with
some hungover bitch

12:39.792 --> 12:42.428
whose own sister thinks
she's gone sociopath? Nah.

12:43.263 --> 12:44.364
‐ You're my family.

12:46.065 --> 12:48.501
‐ No, I'm not.
Hey.

12:49.669 --> 12:51.571
It's a compliment.

12:51.604 --> 12:54.007
Trust me.
Nobody wants to be an Earp.

12:54.040 --> 12:55.508
Gibson?

12:55.541 --> 12:57.844
Maybe.
But Earps?

13:01.080 --> 13:02.849
They always end up alone.

13:12.759 --> 13:14.394
(moaning)

13:14.427 --> 13:16.729
It's more fun killing them
when they're not half‐dead.

13:17.897 --> 13:19.599
Yo, Mini Mentee!
This one's a demon.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.034
‐ His name's also Remy

13:21.067 --> 13:22.702
and he plays bass in a Halsey
tribute band.

13:25.738 --> 13:27.073
The blood's already clotting.

13:27.840 --> 13:28.941
You're gonna make it.

13:28.975 --> 13:32.612
‐ I'm so sorry,
I'm just so hungry.

13:32.645 --> 13:33.680
What happened?

13:33.713 --> 13:35.448
(wincing): BBD got me good.

13:35.481 --> 13:36.849
‐ Black Badge?

13:36.883 --> 13:38.851
Which agent?
‐ A whole mob of them.

13:38.885 --> 13:42.622
Rounding up some demons,
putting down the others.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.157
They took Dallas...

13:44.190 --> 13:45.024
and poor Doc.

13:45.058 --> 13:46.492
‐ Doc?

13:46.526 --> 13:47.527
Why?
‐ Don't know.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.762
But it's better than what
happened to your sister.

13:50.797 --> 13:51.864
‐ What happened to my sister?

13:51.898 --> 13:53.599
‐ It swallowed her up.

13:54.567 --> 13:55.568
The fog.

13:57.970 --> 14:00.506
(thudding)
(Doc): Wake up, you old coot.

14:01.941 --> 14:04.243
‐ What is this place?
‐ A way station.

14:04.277 --> 14:05.978
‐ I demand to speak to
Agent Chetri.

14:06.012 --> 14:06.879
‐ Don't know him.

14:06.913 --> 14:08.815
But we've had a lot of
turnover today.

14:09.582 --> 14:11.017
‐ And what, pray tell,
is your name?

14:11.050 --> 14:12.618
‐ Ha.

14:12.652 --> 14:15.455
In time, you will learn:
this was the only way.

14:19.959 --> 14:22.261
‐ Quarhorn Demon.
(Dallas): And proud of it.

14:22.295 --> 14:23.563
What's it to you?

14:23.596 --> 14:25.098
‐ We already have one of those.

14:26.132 --> 14:27.200
‐ What's that mean?

14:28.568 --> 14:29.902
‐ Hey!

14:29.969 --> 14:33.806
(screaming)

14:33.840 --> 14:36.576
(screeching)

14:38.378 --> 14:39.679
Dallas?!

14:39.712 --> 14:42.715
(snarling)

14:42.749 --> 14:44.083
(ferocious growling)

14:44.117 --> 14:45.918
‐ Well done, vampire.

14:45.952 --> 14:46.953
We'll keep you.

14:46.986 --> 14:49.455
(growling)

14:57.663 --> 14:58.998
(gasping)
(soft moan)

14:59.832 --> 15:02.902
‐ If you're going to kill me,
let's get to it.

15:02.969 --> 15:05.571
‐ I'm sorry if I triggered you.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.507
‐ Triggered?

15:07.540 --> 15:09.409
You tried to destroy me.

15:09.442 --> 15:10.510
‐ Yeah.

15:11.844 --> 15:13.980
But I failed, right?

15:15.748 --> 15:18.050
You were rescued.

15:18.084 --> 15:23.723
By the love and support of
your family and friends.

15:23.756 --> 15:27.093
Now you're happy, healthy.

15:27.126 --> 15:31.597
I mean, I'm kinda medium
on the hair

15:31.631 --> 15:35.968
but otherwise I mean
you are thriving, girl.

15:38.538 --> 15:41.040
You know, while I was
watching you sleep,

15:41.073 --> 15:43.976
I did a little bit
of reflecting.

15:44.010 --> 15:45.511
On the last time that
we hung out.

15:45.545 --> 15:46.679
(scoffing)

15:46.712 --> 15:49.682
And just how terrible it was,
you know, for both of us.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.752
And I realized something,

15:54.720 --> 15:57.590
I'm not mad at you anymore.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.393
I'm sad for you.

16:00.426 --> 16:01.794
‐ Jolene.

16:02.862 --> 16:03.996
Always a liar.

16:06.833 --> 16:08.901
‐ That's why I wanna help you.

16:08.935 --> 16:12.738
‐ You've been in the fog
for far too long.

16:12.772 --> 16:15.508
Because you've lost
your goddamn mind.

16:15.541 --> 16:17.710
‐ Don't you get it, Waverly?

16:19.078 --> 16:23.983
Demons are just fallen angels.

16:25.051 --> 16:30.823
Everything that you have been
fighting your whole life ‐

16:30.857 --> 16:32.658
you're one of them.

16:33.993 --> 16:37.196
Whether you want to
admit it or not.

16:37.230 --> 16:39.198
(softly): I won't ‐
I won't listen.

16:39.232 --> 16:41.667
‐ You and I are the same.

16:41.701 --> 16:43.035
‐ Shut up!

16:43.069 --> 16:46.806
‐ I mean, you may not want to
call me sister.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.643
But we are kin.

16:55.915 --> 16:58.951
(birds chirping)

17:01.721 --> 17:03.523
‐ Every second Waverly
is in the fog

17:03.556 --> 17:05.124
she's a second closer to
tearing off her own face.

17:05.157 --> 17:07.059
‐ And is now a
good time to tell you that

17:07.093 --> 17:08.294
Cleo is the
new Clanton heir

17:08.327 --> 17:10.930
and sent the Reapers to feed on
a bus full of seniors?

17:10.963 --> 17:12.832
‐ We need help
navigating this shit.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.667
Where is he?
‐ His phone's disconnected.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.836
‐ We haven't heard from Jeremy
in days.

17:16.869 --> 17:19.138
‐ Yeah and Remy said BBD's
rounding up demons?

17:19.171 --> 17:20.540
‐ Demons including Doc.

17:20.573 --> 17:22.975
(Nicole sighs)
(Rachel): This is a lot.

17:23.009 --> 17:24.877
‐ Welcome to the big show, kid.

17:24.911 --> 17:27.079
‐ Hey, we will get him back,
Wynonna.

17:27.113 --> 17:28.748
‐ Doc can take care of himself,

17:28.781 --> 17:31.784
and I'm sorry about the geezers,
but Cleo can wait too.

17:31.817 --> 17:34.587
Waverly is priority one.
Always.

17:35.922 --> 17:37.657
‐ How do we find her?

17:37.690 --> 17:39.759
‐ With the only fog expert
I know.

17:40.192 --> 17:42.595
‐ Whoa. Whoa!
Not to kink shame,

17:42.628 --> 17:45.131
but I'm not really
a harness kind of guy.

17:45.164 --> 17:47.266
‐ Well, you know the mind murk
better than anyone.

17:47.300 --> 17:48.734
And you owe me and Waverly

17:48.768 --> 17:50.937
for getting us fog‐fucked at
Halloween.

17:50.970 --> 17:52.471
‐ Ancient history, dude.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.273
And I made you
an apology casserole.

17:54.307 --> 17:56.609
‐ You covered Kraft Dinner with
kimchi and weed.

17:56.642 --> 17:58.811
‐ Mmmm.
You're welcome.

17:58.844 --> 18:01.147
I know you've been mapping out
the fog.

18:01.180 --> 18:02.982
It's not our fault you didn't
actually write it down.

18:03.015 --> 18:07.486
‐ They can't use it against you,
if it stays up here.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.488
‐ Who's "they" and what's "it"?
(inhaling)

18:09.522 --> 18:11.290
(Nicole): Okay. He's done.
Our turn.

18:11.324 --> 18:13.225
‐ I knew you and I would
get here eventually.

18:13.259 --> 18:15.528
‐ Whoa, no‐go, Pixie Chicks.

18:15.561 --> 18:16.929
I'm only taking one of you
in there.

18:16.963 --> 18:18.631
‐ Say what?
‐ As good as I am

18:18.664 --> 18:19.699
at navigating the fog,

18:19.732 --> 18:21.734
it's gonna be thick like a
deep‐dish pizza in there

18:21.767 --> 18:23.603
and I can't keep tabs on
both of you.

18:23.636 --> 18:24.637
So who's it gonna be?

18:24.670 --> 18:25.905
‐ Obviously me.
‐ I'm going.

18:26.806 --> 18:28.307
‐ She's my sister.
‐ She's my future wife.

18:28.341 --> 18:29.809
(Rachel): Mm.

18:29.842 --> 18:31.010
‐ Well, if marrying my sister
was legal,

18:31.043 --> 18:31.877
I'd have done it already,

18:31.911 --> 18:33.846
so check your privilege,
Haught Wheels.

18:33.879 --> 18:35.514
‐ It's my gear.
I know how to work it.

18:35.548 --> 18:36.716
‐ Casey's my friend.
I know how to work him.

18:36.749 --> 18:37.817
‐ What does that even mean?

18:37.850 --> 18:39.151
It means we have a
mind‐meld thing

18:39.185 --> 18:40.686
ever since
we cooked chili together.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.121
(both): For freedom.
‐ Okay, stop.

18:42.154 --> 18:43.823
I'm putting my foot down.
‐ Stop.

18:43.856 --> 18:45.091
I'm gonna put my foot up
your ass!

18:45.124 --> 18:47.193
‐ It's my fucking turn, Wynonna!

18:48.527 --> 18:49.795
You went into the Garden to
save her

18:49.829 --> 18:51.797
and I went home,
alone.

18:51.831 --> 18:53.666
For eighteen months, I did it.

18:53.699 --> 18:54.700
Alone.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.203
I'm not gonna do that again.

18:57.236 --> 18:59.271
I am doing this.

19:01.040 --> 19:01.974
‐ She's right.

19:02.008 --> 19:03.209
It is her turn.

19:04.543 --> 19:05.678
‐ Judas.

19:09.715 --> 19:11.050
Alright, fine.

19:11.083 --> 19:13.185
But only because we're
wasting time arguing.

19:13.219 --> 19:16.555
Strap in, strap on,
get your... stuff.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.290
Just save my sister before
she goes crazy

19:18.324 --> 19:20.059
and rips her own face off.

19:21.627 --> 19:23.929
(breathing heavily)

19:26.198 --> 19:28.834
‐ That's mine.
‐ Yeah.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.036
‐ That's mine!

19:32.304 --> 19:33.773
‐ But this...

19:34.740 --> 19:36.308
this is Wynonna's.

19:36.942 --> 19:38.110
Uh!

19:39.679 --> 19:44.583
The Earp heir's magic gun.

19:45.751 --> 19:47.687
So much power.

19:47.720 --> 19:48.354
(sizzling)

19:48.387 --> 19:49.722
Ah!

19:51.190 --> 19:53.859
‐ It knows you're not worthy to
hold it.

19:53.893 --> 19:59.965
‐ That's why I so much more
prefer knives.

20:01.967 --> 20:05.371
‐ You can threaten me
all you like.

20:05.404 --> 20:07.807
I am done being afraid of you.

20:08.841 --> 20:10.276
(grunting)

20:17.116 --> 20:18.951
‐ Make yourself at home.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.499
‐ Is that how many days
you've been trapped here?

20:37.403 --> 20:39.772
‐ Can I ask you something?

20:39.805 --> 20:42.675
You know, sorta
sister to sister.

20:42.708 --> 20:44.343
‐ Stop calling me that.

20:44.376 --> 20:47.313
‐ Does it ever get boring?

20:47.346 --> 20:50.216
Playing the role of
damsel in distress?

20:50.249 --> 20:52.017
‐ I don't play the damsel.

20:52.051 --> 20:55.387
‐ Or is it that you just
don't want the burden of

20:55.421 --> 20:57.356
being a hero?

20:57.389 --> 20:59.759
‐ I'm plenty heroic.
‐ Well,

20:59.792 --> 21:03.195
you weren't willing to
sit on the throne, were you?

21:04.797 --> 21:07.800
You didn't stop Bulshar from
opening up the Garden

21:07.833 --> 21:10.202
and enslaving humanity.

21:11.704 --> 21:14.306
Because I knew Wynonna would
stop him. And she did.

21:14.340 --> 21:15.975
(softly): Yeah...

21:16.008 --> 21:21.914
And now she drinks herself to
sleep every single night

21:23.048 --> 21:26.952
while you giggle in
Nicole's arms.

21:33.125 --> 21:36.829
Are you punishing Wynonna

21:36.862 --> 21:40.032
because she was chosen and
you weren't?

21:40.065 --> 21:41.200
‐ No.

21:43.035 --> 21:45.004
No.

21:45.037 --> 21:46.839
No, I've b...

21:46.872 --> 21:49.008
I've been by her side
every step of the way.

21:49.041 --> 21:51.010
‐ Not lately.

21:51.043 --> 21:52.044
And now,

21:53.445 --> 21:55.281
now you have all this talent

21:55.314 --> 21:58.217
and you're channelling it
into what is it?

21:58.250 --> 21:59.451
Wedding planning?

21:59.485 --> 22:02.988
‐ Save your patronizing
mouth‐garbage.

22:03.022 --> 22:05.925
I can be a hero and a wife.

22:05.958 --> 22:07.326
‐ Waverly,

22:08.227 --> 22:11.730
you have wanted
your whole life...

22:12.398 --> 22:13.833
to be special.

22:13.866 --> 22:16.368
‐ I won't tap into a power
I can't control.

22:21.440 --> 22:23.943
(whimpering)

22:23.976 --> 22:25.244
(moaning)

22:27.079 --> 22:28.948
‐ Those hash marks?

22:31.750 --> 22:36.789
Those are all the lives that
Wynonna has had to snuff out

22:38.224 --> 22:39.992
to save yours.

22:41.160 --> 22:42.361
And yeah,

22:43.262 --> 22:46.265
some of them were
demons...

22:46.298 --> 22:50.803
but you and I both know
some of them weren't.

22:51.437 --> 22:53.305
‐ No.

22:53.339 --> 22:59.511
‐ Imagine the weight of
all of that blood on her hands.

22:59.545 --> 23:05.484
Because you wouldn't lift
one single angelic finger

23:05.517 --> 23:07.987
just to help her.

23:08.020 --> 23:10.222
‐ No. This is a trick.

23:10.256 --> 23:11.457
That's not what this is.

23:13.025 --> 23:14.193
And I know it.

23:14.226 --> 23:17.997
(softly): Let me help you
be free.

23:18.397 --> 23:19.832
‐ Ah!

23:20.599 --> 23:21.901
Gah.

23:21.934 --> 23:24.103
‐ Stupid!

23:24.136 --> 23:26.238
Selfish!

23:26.272 --> 23:28.140
Little Angel!

23:28.874 --> 23:30.109
‐ Okay.

23:30.142 --> 23:31.844
Use this to talk to us
while we're in there

23:31.877 --> 23:33.178
and if you feel three tugs
on the line,

23:33.212 --> 23:35.114
you gotta pull us back in ASAP.

23:35.147 --> 23:36.148
‐ Got it.

23:42.187 --> 23:43.589
Go get our girl.

23:43.622 --> 23:44.890
(Rachel): Good luck.

23:49.561 --> 23:52.331
(Casey, muffled): Put your hand
on my shoulder or I'll lose you.

23:58.837 --> 24:00.539
‐ How's it going?
What do you see?

24:00.572 --> 24:03.509
(Nicole): Literally nothing.
I can't even see Casey.

24:03.542 --> 24:06.178
(Casey): I've been in here
enough times, I've adjusted.

24:06.211 --> 24:08.414
Like how cats and squirrels can
see in the dark.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.382
‐ Squirrels can't see
in the dark.

24:10.416 --> 24:13.385
‐ And yet, he's the best shot
we have.

24:13.419 --> 24:16.655
(Casey): Alright, follow me
along the treeline then ‐ wait.

24:16.689 --> 24:18.490
Hold on, I think
I see something.

24:18.524 --> 24:20.426
(Nicole): It's a cabin.

24:20.459 --> 24:21.927
‐ If Waverly went inside,

24:21.961 --> 24:24.430
maybe her brain isn't
scrambled eggs after all.

24:24.463 --> 24:25.631
Maybe it keeps the fog out.

24:26.665 --> 24:28.300
(Nicole): Okay,
we're‐we're heading in.

24:28.334 --> 24:30.970
(door creaking)

24:31.003 --> 24:32.671
(Nicole and Casey): Waverly?

24:32.705 --> 24:34.340
(both): Waverly?

24:34.373 --> 24:38.477
(panting)

24:38.510 --> 24:39.511
‐ What's going on?

24:39.545 --> 24:40.980
What's that sound?

24:42.147 --> 24:43.515
(Nicole): Oh my god, Waverly.
She's tied up.

24:43.549 --> 24:46.085
‐ Well... let her loose!

24:46.118 --> 24:48.320
(Casey): Aye, aye, captain!
(Nicole): Casey, wait! No!

24:48.354 --> 24:52.524
(Casey screaming)
(thudding)

24:52.558 --> 24:53.659
‐ What's going on?

24:54.526 --> 24:57.329
What's going on?
Is‐is Waverly okay?

24:57.363 --> 25:00.032
(Nicole): There's something
else in here!

25:00.065 --> 25:02.968
(Casey): Run!
Nicole, get out!

25:03.002 --> 25:05.270
(growling)

25:05.304 --> 25:06.205
‐ Guys?

25:06.238 --> 25:07.573
(radio crackling)

25:07.606 --> 25:08.941
Guys?!

25:08.974 --> 25:11.443
What's going on?
Is Waverly okay?

25:11.477 --> 25:13.012
(crackling)

25:13.045 --> 25:14.913
Are you okay?
Haught!

25:16.615 --> 25:19.084
(Nicole): I don't know how
but it's her.

25:19.118 --> 25:20.285
It's Jolene!

25:20.319 --> 25:22.654
(dramatic music)

25:23.555 --> 25:25.924
‐ No. She's dead.
I killed her.

25:26.258 --> 25:27.493
(Rachel): We have to pull them
back in!

25:27.526 --> 25:28.727
‐ No!

25:28.761 --> 25:30.229
We can't leave Waverly alone
with Jolene.

25:30.262 --> 25:32.097
‐ Who the hell's Jolene?

25:33.265 --> 25:34.933
(three thuds)

25:34.967 --> 25:36.201
That's the signal.

25:36.235 --> 25:37.403
We have to.
‐ Waverly's still in there!

25:37.436 --> 25:38.604
‐ They could be hurt!

25:38.637 --> 25:40.205
‐ Rachel, no!

25:40.239 --> 25:41.440
(whirring)
(dramatic music)

25:41.473 --> 25:44.676
(grunting in effort)

25:54.119 --> 25:55.054
(grunting)

26:00.125 --> 26:02.428
(radio crackling)

26:04.296 --> 26:05.664
Nicole!

26:07.399 --> 26:08.667
Nicole!

26:09.701 --> 26:11.070
(moaning)
(Nicole): It's okay!

26:11.103 --> 26:12.271
(coughing)

26:12.304 --> 26:13.272
The fog spit me out...

26:13.305 --> 26:15.307
somewhere.
I'm just...

26:15.340 --> 26:16.608
(coughing)

26:16.642 --> 26:18.277
I'm safe, I just don't know
where.

26:19.044 --> 26:20.979
(panting): It's Jolene.

26:22.081 --> 26:24.616
I don't know how Wynonna,
but she's alive.

26:24.650 --> 26:25.717
And she's got Waverly.

26:27.219 --> 26:28.387
‐ Wynonna?

26:30.489 --> 26:33.559
Shouldn't we start CPR
or something?

26:33.592 --> 26:35.127
We can still save him.

26:35.160 --> 26:36.495
‐ His neck is broken.

26:38.097 --> 26:40.499
Waverly!

26:51.310 --> 26:53.112
‐ You'll what?

26:53.145 --> 26:57.049
What?
You'll do nothing, as usual?

26:58.784 --> 27:01.086
(screaming)

27:01.120 --> 27:03.522
Ah!
(panting)

27:04.756 --> 27:06.225
(sizzling)

27:06.258 --> 27:07.659
(yelping)

27:07.693 --> 27:09.695
‐ Demons can't hold Peacemaker,
sister.

27:09.728 --> 27:12.698
Looks like you're finally
embracing your dark side.

27:12.731 --> 27:15.100
(screaming)

27:15.134 --> 27:17.136
(yelling out in pain)

27:17.169 --> 27:18.103
(Waverly screaming)

27:18.137 --> 27:19.438
Oh! What the hell?

27:19.471 --> 27:20.806
Ah!
(Jolene grunting)

27:20.839 --> 27:23.308
‐ I wanted to do this
the nice way

27:23.342 --> 27:25.511
but if you insist...
(Waverly whimpering)

27:26.345 --> 27:30.315
‐ Ah!
(screaming in pain)

27:30.349 --> 27:34.386
Ah! Ahh!
(breathing heavily)

27:36.555 --> 27:38.323
(whispering): What did you do
to me?

27:39.758 --> 27:41.293
(groaning in pain)

27:42.094 --> 27:45.097
‐ Casey should be buried
by his home, on his land.

27:45.130 --> 27:46.265
‐ We have to leave him.

27:46.832 --> 27:48.433
‐ What are you talking about?

27:48.467 --> 27:49.801
He's our friend.

27:49.835 --> 27:52.437
He died he‐‐
‐ We don't have time!

27:52.471 --> 27:54.139
Waverly is trapped with the
demon who's been after her

27:54.173 --> 27:55.641
since she was born.

27:55.674 --> 27:57.776
We need to get back in there,
alright?

27:57.809 --> 28:00.212
‐ How? Casey was the only one
who could see anything in‐‐

28:00.245 --> 28:01.680
‐ I don't know!
I will figure it out!

28:01.713 --> 28:05.050
I will figure it out.
Um, I'll ‐ I'm going in.

28:07.186 --> 28:08.687
‐ Waverly's still alive.

28:08.720 --> 28:12.224
Which means this Jolene
has other plans for her, right?

28:14.826 --> 28:17.095
‐ I called her a
sanctimonious asshole.

28:18.063 --> 28:19.631
(sobbing)

28:19.665 --> 28:21.400
That's the last thing
I said to her.

28:22.601 --> 28:24.770
(Nicole): Waverly knows
how much you love her.

28:24.803 --> 28:26.538
The one thing she couldn't
endure

28:26.572 --> 28:28.507
is you getting killed
to save her.

28:28.540 --> 28:31.410
We gotta go to Plan B, Wynonna.
(Wynonna sighs)

28:31.443 --> 28:33.812
‐ We need Jeremy. He's been
working on a cure for the fog.

28:33.845 --> 28:35.714
He can help us.

28:39.251 --> 28:40.552
‐ Still disconnected.

28:40.586 --> 28:43.755
(Nicole): Wynonna!
My radio's about to die.

28:43.789 --> 28:45.357
‐ Alright, uh,

28:45.390 --> 28:46.258
get back here

28:46.291 --> 28:47.459
as soon as you can.

28:47.492 --> 28:48.694
‐ Copy that.

28:50.629 --> 28:51.563
‐ Stay here.

28:52.598 --> 28:54.566
Just make sure nobody messes
with Casey's body.

28:54.600 --> 28:56.535
We'll give him a proper burial,
okay?

28:57.236 --> 28:58.103
As soon as we can.

29:04.576 --> 29:05.744
‐ Where are you taking me?

29:05.777 --> 29:07.179
‐ You're one of the lucky ones

29:07.212 --> 29:08.914
who gets a one‐way ticket on
the ark.

29:08.947 --> 29:10.315
‐ The ark?

29:10.349 --> 29:12.251
‐ It's not a literal ark.

29:12.284 --> 29:13.385
Relax.

29:13.418 --> 29:14.453
(Jeremy): Doc!

29:15.354 --> 29:16.655
‐ Jeremy!
‐ Doc!

29:16.688 --> 29:17.589
I've been trying to tell them

29:17.623 --> 29:20.292
that there's been a
monster‐size mix up!

29:20.325 --> 29:22.961
‐ Open this cell at once,
those are humans!

29:22.995 --> 29:24.529
And Freddy.

29:24.563 --> 29:25.931
And this is a BBD Agent.

29:25.964 --> 29:27.399
‐ He must've done
something wrong

29:27.432 --> 29:29.234
if he ended up in
the feed pen.

29:29.268 --> 29:30.369
‐ What?

29:30.402 --> 29:32.571
(growling)

29:32.604 --> 29:34.273
‐ I'm just following orders.

29:34.306 --> 29:35.641
‐ I told you, I would
remember your face.

29:35.674 --> 29:37.309
‐ No, Doc, stop!

29:37.342 --> 29:39.645
Volkov, you should be at home
with Laura and your girls

29:39.678 --> 29:41.346
making sure that they
get out safe.

29:41.380 --> 29:43.482
Not doing whatever this is.

29:45.884 --> 29:47.152
‐ If you're workin' for them,

29:47.185 --> 29:48.420
why they got you locked up
in here?

29:48.453 --> 29:51.256
‐ Upper management initiated
a protocol I never heard of.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.292
I‐I protested so they put me
in here.

29:55.394 --> 29:56.662
‐ You got an access card?

29:56.695 --> 29:58.563
‐ No, no.
It's been deactivated.

29:58.597 --> 30:01.199
‐ Technology be damned.
‐ No, don't!

30:01.233 --> 30:02.434
(fizzling)

30:02.467 --> 30:08.407
(alarm sounding)
(electronic music)

30:08.440 --> 30:11.843
‐ As it seems, am I.

30:12.944 --> 30:15.280
(Wynonna): Open the damn door!
(pounding on door)

30:15.314 --> 30:17.749
Open up, I'm BBD too!

30:18.684 --> 30:19.751
(knocks and groans)

30:23.622 --> 30:25.624
Listen up!

30:25.657 --> 30:27.693
I'm Special Agent Earp.

30:27.726 --> 30:30.262
I killed a mountain of demons
for you people

30:30.295 --> 30:33.298
and I need your help so open
the goddamned door!

30:33.332 --> 30:35.367
(buzzer sounding)

30:38.003 --> 30:38.937
‐ I come in peace.

30:38.970 --> 30:40.806
‐ One bad move you go in pieces.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.708
‐ Wynonna Earp.

30:42.741 --> 30:44.843
I could not have asked for a
better soldier in my army.

30:44.876 --> 30:46.278
‐ Who the hell are you?

30:46.311 --> 30:49.381
‐ General Graham.
OTF Special Projects.

30:49.414 --> 30:50.315
‐ Upper management?

30:50.349 --> 30:51.850
‐ The upper‐est.

30:51.883 --> 30:53.385
It's good that you came when
you did.

30:53.418 --> 30:54.653
We need to move you

30:54.686 --> 30:56.288
and the other assets to
a secure facility.

30:56.321 --> 30:58.557
‐ I'm not going anywhere
without my sister.

30:58.590 --> 30:59.791
Or my friends.

30:59.825 --> 31:02.561
Who, rumour has it, you have
in your Barbie Dream House here.

31:02.594 --> 31:03.662
‐ You can't stay behind.

31:03.695 --> 31:06.031
This facility, your town,

31:06.064 --> 31:07.933
the entire Ghost River Triangle,

31:07.966 --> 31:10.001
will be swallowed by the fog
in a matter of days.

31:10.035 --> 31:12.804
‐ I'm not leaving Purgatory to
get wiped out.

31:12.838 --> 31:14.740
We stay and we fight.

31:14.773 --> 31:16.708
‐ There is no way to fight this.

31:16.742 --> 31:19.678
We tried to destroy the fog,
and we failed.

31:19.711 --> 31:21.012
We tried to contain it.

31:21.580 --> 31:22.914
We failed.

31:22.948 --> 31:25.050
‐ I've been defending our
shithole for too long,

31:25.083 --> 31:27.519
against too many
powerful enemies,

31:27.552 --> 31:31.590
to lose it to magic weather,
so give me Agent Chetri.

31:32.657 --> 31:34.025
I need him to fix this.

31:35.627 --> 31:37.396
BBD at least owes me that.

31:39.331 --> 31:41.266
‐ I'm sad to lose
my best recruit,

31:42.367 --> 31:43.368
but yes...

31:44.569 --> 31:46.605
You've earned severance pay.

31:47.072 --> 31:49.541
(sighing deeply)

31:50.575 --> 31:52.411
‐ Are you really taking me
to see Jeremy

31:52.444 --> 31:54.813
or is this a "stay sexy
don't get murdered" situation?

31:54.846 --> 31:56.948
‐ What?
I'm a man of my word.

31:57.949 --> 32:00.919
Listen, I've decommissioned
an old missile silo in Montana.

32:00.952 --> 32:02.454
It will be operational in
three weeks.

32:02.487 --> 32:04.022
Come with me and keep fighting.

32:04.055 --> 32:05.390
You stay, you die.

32:05.424 --> 32:07.626
‐ I am not leaving my sister.

32:07.659 --> 32:09.060
‐ Even if you get her back...

32:09.828 --> 32:10.796
(sighing)

32:12.431 --> 32:14.065
...the only creatures that can
survive the fog

32:14.099 --> 32:17.035
are the ones that are already
dead and have no minds to lose.

32:17.068 --> 32:20.605
‐ You've clearly never seen
Waverly tackle a Sudoku.

32:20.639 --> 32:22.307
Oh my god, guys!
‐ Wy‐Wynonna!

32:22.340 --> 32:25.076
‐ Doc. I'm so happy to see you!
‐ Are you alright?

32:25.110 --> 32:26.945
‐ You?
‐ Yeah,

32:26.978 --> 32:28.480
we are safe
for the time being.

32:28.513 --> 32:30.782
Waverly was lost in the fog.
It is spreading.

32:30.816 --> 32:32.818
‐ I know.
That's why I'm here.

32:34.019 --> 32:36.321
I need them both.
‐ You get one.

32:42.527 --> 32:43.862
‐ Jeremy, I need you to come
with me.

32:43.895 --> 32:44.729
‐ Okay.

32:44.763 --> 32:46.865
‐ You're sure you want
Agent Chetri?

32:46.898 --> 32:48.600
The vampire is fierce.

32:48.633 --> 32:50.302
Might be a better choice to
save your sister.

32:58.677 --> 33:01.646
I'm so sorry.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.815
For so many things.

33:07.686 --> 33:08.587
I want her.

33:09.988 --> 33:11.423
‐ Say what?

33:11.456 --> 33:13.091
‐ Excuse me?
‐ Beg your pardon?

33:13.124 --> 33:14.125
(buzzer sounding)

33:14.159 --> 33:15.627
(chuckling)

33:15.660 --> 33:17.028
‐ I swear I'll come back
for you.

33:17.062 --> 33:18.797
Please trust me.

33:18.830 --> 33:21.399
I will come back for you
I just need her more.

33:21.433 --> 33:23.468
‐ Thanks for the jailbreak,
Earp.

33:23.902 --> 33:26.505
‐ I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry!

33:26.538 --> 33:28.940
‐ Wynonna they're gonna turn us
into food!

33:28.974 --> 33:31.076
‐ Wynonna, do not do this!

33:37.315 --> 33:40.819
(Jolene): Oh, my sweet
litt

33:40.852 --> 33:42.621
I tried to warn you.

33:42.654 --> 33:44.055
I tried to help you.

33:44.089 --> 33:46.091
‐ Shut up, shut up.

33:46.124 --> 33:49.160
‐ Hm.
‐ Just make it stop!

33:49.194 --> 33:51.196
‐ Only you can do that.

33:51.229 --> 33:52.697
By letting it out.

33:52.731 --> 33:53.932
‐ I won't.

33:55.133 --> 33:58.236
Become what you were always
meant to be.

33:58.270 --> 34:00.872
‐ I don't want to be an angel.
‐ No.

34:00.906 --> 34:02.841
‐ I don't want to be a demon.

34:02.874 --> 34:05.310
I just want to go home!

34:05.343 --> 34:07.579
‐ Shhhh.

34:07.612 --> 34:09.247
(high‐pitched): Ah!

34:09.281 --> 34:15.320
‐ Stop denying your nature and
let it out.

34:15.353 --> 34:17.088
(screaming)

34:21.393 --> 34:25.196
‐ We will bring you home, Casey,
once Wynonna fixes all of this.

34:25.230 --> 34:27.332
‐ Rachel!
(Rachel): We're here.

34:31.836 --> 34:34.139
(panting)

34:38.743 --> 34:40.645
‐ That's nice, Rachel.

34:40.679 --> 34:43.748
‐ Is this what it's like
for you, all the time?

34:44.583 --> 34:45.750
‐ Yeah.

34:49.721 --> 34:52.123
‐ Where's Nicole?
And Doc and Jeremy?

34:54.192 --> 34:55.627
‐ Let's go.

35:06.805 --> 35:09.908
‐ You chose her over
our friends?

35:09.941 --> 35:13.345
‐ She's the Clanton heir now,
she has control of the Reapers.

35:13.378 --> 35:15.180
Once the Reapers have
their mark, they don't stop.

35:15.213 --> 35:16.948
I can follow it into the fog,
straight to Jolene.

35:16.982 --> 35:18.083
It's our only shot.

35:20.418 --> 35:22.921
‐ I'm gonna need something from
the one you want marked.

35:23.989 --> 35:26.658
‐ Casey ripped out some of
Jolene's hair, in the fight.

35:26.691 --> 35:28.259
He came out clutching it.

35:28.293 --> 35:29.928
‐ You sure Nicole would be
on board with this?

35:29.961 --> 35:31.696
‐ Oh, sure.
‐ Hey.

35:31.730 --> 35:33.365
Shut up and spell.

35:33.398 --> 35:35.033
‐ Now, now.

35:35.066 --> 35:37.102
I'm doing you a
favour remember?

35:37.135 --> 35:40.405
‐ If you don't, I'll put one
right between your eyes.

35:40.438 --> 35:41.773
‐ Ooh.

35:41.806 --> 35:43.808
Better than in my back.

35:44.976 --> 35:46.945
‐ Which Reaper will you send?

35:46.978 --> 35:48.213
It's not Billy, right?

35:48.246 --> 35:49.948
‐ Of course not.

35:53.151 --> 35:55.286
If Cleo tries anything,
shoot her.

35:56.721 --> 35:58.423
You up for this?
‐ Uh‐huh.

36:00.492 --> 36:01.860
(sighing)

36:02.360 --> 36:03.395
‐ Okay.

36:04.829 --> 36:06.698
(exhaling)

36:07.465 --> 36:09.901
Summoning our ancient grudge,

36:09.934 --> 36:13.438
I mark with blood those
we've adjudged.

36:15.273 --> 36:18.810
(thundering)

36:18.843 --> 36:20.745
(disgusted shuddering)

36:20.779 --> 36:22.447
(snarling)
(gasping in surprise)

36:22.480 --> 36:25.283
(growling)

36:28.720 --> 36:31.156
(growling)

36:31.189 --> 36:33.358
Holy shit I did it!

36:33.391 --> 36:35.160
‐ How?

36:35.193 --> 36:37.062
‐ I added a strand of your hair
in there too.

36:37.095 --> 36:38.730
To bind you together,
so you could see him.

36:39.731 --> 36:41.066
What?
I thought it would help.

37:01.052 --> 37:02.887
Goodbye, brother.

37:06.891 --> 37:08.760
Good luck.
Don't get dead.

37:08.793 --> 37:11.463
Or do.
I don't really care either way.

37:11.496 --> 37:12.931
His leash.

37:16.067 --> 37:16.901
(She whistles.)

37:16.935 --> 37:19.003
(growling)

37:20.371 --> 37:25.410
(dramatic music)

37:27.345 --> 37:30.181
(distorted panting)
(growling)

37:35.920 --> 37:37.055
(growling)
(distorted moan)

37:41.426 --> 37:42.961
(distorted moan)

37:45.463 --> 37:49.000
(moaning)

37:50.435 --> 37:53.171
Get your hands off my sister,
you unholy bitch!

37:53.204 --> 37:54.839
(Reaper screeching)
(softly): Wynonna.

37:54.873 --> 37:56.975
(growling)

37:57.008 --> 37:58.276
‐ What'd she do to you?

37:59.511 --> 38:00.979
Come on, get up.

38:01.012 --> 38:03.882
‐ I can't.
It hurts too much.

38:03.915 --> 38:05.383
(sobbing)

38:05.416 --> 38:08.453
Listen, Peacemaker is here
somewhere.

38:08.486 --> 38:12.123
Find it, and stop her
once and for all.

38:12.157 --> 38:15.927
And then if it comes to it,
stop me too.

38:15.960 --> 38:17.295
‐ Just stop talking like that.

38:17.328 --> 38:18.830
Alright, let's get out of here.

38:19.998 --> 38:22.400
Here, take this.
‐ You only have one mask.

38:22.433 --> 38:24.135
‐ It's okay, we'll share it.
We'll figure it out.

38:24.169 --> 38:26.171
Let's go!
(Jolene growling)

38:26.204 --> 38:27.839
‐ Wynonna!

38:29.140 --> 38:30.842
(high‐pitched sound)

38:30.875 --> 38:34.412
‐ Wynonna!

38:34.445 --> 38:38.283
(sobbing)
‐ Yeah. Cry.

38:38.316 --> 38:41.953
Wynonna died knowing that you
hated her

38:41.986 --> 38:45.390
too much to even try!

38:46.357 --> 38:49.494
(growling)

38:49.527 --> 38:51.262
(grunting)

38:54.465 --> 38:58.536
‐ There you are,
you little demon.

38:58.570 --> 39:00.905
I knew you could do it.

39:02.006 --> 39:07.879
(dramatic music)
(creaking)

39:07.912 --> 39:11.516
(screeching)

39:16.387 --> 39:17.555
You're so beautiful.

39:17.589 --> 39:21.693
You're more glorious than
I could have ever imagined.

39:22.460 --> 39:24.128
‐ You are nothing to me.

39:24.162 --> 39:26.130
(Jolene choking)
(cracking)

39:26.164 --> 39:27.732
‐ Who made you?

39:29.167 --> 39:34.305
Now, go destroy the whole world.

39:34.339 --> 39:35.673
‐ Yes.

39:39.711 --> 39:42.547
But you will not bear witness.

39:42.580 --> 39:45.316
(whooshing)
(cracking)

39:45.350 --> 39:47.252
(soft moans)

39:53.825 --> 39:56.728
(growling)

39:56.761 --> 40:00.064
‐ If we cannot use our brawn,
then lets use our heads.

40:00.098 --> 40:01.766
(sighing): Okay.
Okay, okay.

40:01.799 --> 40:04.202
We know that certain demons are
being executed,

40:04.235 --> 40:05.436
and others are being transported

40:05.470 --> 40:07.572
to something the guard called
"the ark".

40:07.605 --> 40:09.407
‐ The Noah Protocol.

40:09.440 --> 40:11.709
No points for subtlety.
‐ Yeah.

40:11.743 --> 40:13.611
If they're Noah's Arking
the demons out of here,

40:13.645 --> 40:15.280
why keep the humans?

40:15.313 --> 40:17.615
‐ Because animals need food.

40:18.483 --> 40:20.251
‐ Knock, knock!

40:20.285 --> 40:21.519
‐ Mercedes?

40:21.552 --> 40:24.322
‐ As you almost live and
sort of breathe!

40:24.355 --> 40:26.824
I have been hiding
in those vents for hours

40:26.858 --> 40:28.693
waiting for the coast to clear.

40:28.726 --> 40:30.728
And I found this.

40:30.762 --> 40:32.797
(all chuckling)

40:34.432 --> 40:36.401
Um?
‐ That is, as they say,

40:36.434 --> 40:37.735
uh, my bad.

40:38.736 --> 40:39.804
‐ Jeremy, I don't suppose that

40:39.837 --> 40:41.806
hot wiring is one of your
nerd talents?

40:41.839 --> 40:43.508
‐ I can try.

40:47.478 --> 40:50.181
Perfect, thank you.
‐ I was at Amon's,

40:50.214 --> 40:53.518
in my dressing room,
five minutes before curtain call

40:53.551 --> 40:57.355
and then flash bangs and...
yeah, sorry ‐ and gun shots.

40:57.388 --> 41:00.725
BBD stormed in and I tried to
tell them that I was human.

41:00.758 --> 41:02.427
I mean look at me,

41:02.460 --> 41:04.329
have you ever seen a demon with
a rack like this?

41:05.463 --> 41:06.431
(all three): Kate.

41:06.464 --> 41:07.598
(fizzling)
(Jeremy): Ow!

41:07.632 --> 41:09.467
‐ Ah!
‐ Yes! It worked!

41:12.203 --> 41:14.439
‐ I was hoping you'd reconsider,
vampire.

41:14.472 --> 41:16.140
(door thudding)

41:16.174 --> 41:17.809
But I see now you're committed
to the losing side.

41:17.842 --> 41:21.312
‐ I will not let you hurt
one hair on their heads.

41:21.346 --> 41:23.481
‐ General, please. This is not
what our mission is about.

41:23.514 --> 41:24.849
We‐we swore to protect
these people.

41:24.882 --> 41:26.417
‐ You've seen the files, Agent.

41:26.451 --> 41:28.319
Maldito, Monument.

41:28.353 --> 41:30.555
We can't protect anyone.

41:30.588 --> 41:32.256
But I know now that the
real tragedy of

41:32.290 --> 41:33.591
our failed missions is that

41:33.624 --> 41:36.294
we left our most valuable assets
behind.

41:38.463 --> 41:39.630
‐ Demons.
‐ Oh.

41:39.664 --> 41:41.265
‐ I won't make the
same mistake again.

41:41.299 --> 41:43.267
‐ And the humans?

41:43.301 --> 41:45.303
‐ Acceptable collateral damage.

41:45.336 --> 41:46.838
‐ Put your peckers away, guys.

41:46.871 --> 41:48.473
Let me handle this.

41:48.506 --> 41:50.541
I have a friend in the
State Department.

41:50.575 --> 41:52.643
A very high level custodian

41:52.677 --> 41:56.481
who cleans the offices of
very important people.

41:56.514 --> 41:58.516
So if you think that you're
gonna get away with an‐‐

41:58.549 --> 41:59.350
(gunshot)
Ugh!

41:59.384 --> 42:00.518
(thud)

42:00.551 --> 42:02.220
That can't happen.

42:02.253 --> 42:03.621
I'm sure you understand why.

42:05.857 --> 42:07.392
(growling)

42:08.359 --> 42:11.963
(distorted moaning)

42:13.531 --> 42:15.500
(distorted moaning)

42:18.703 --> 42:21.205
(distorted groaning)

42:21.239 --> 42:23.641
(gasping)

42:25.376 --> 42:26.544
Ha!
(loud inhale)

42:26.577 --> 42:27.912
(gasping)

42:27.945 --> 42:32.183
(panting)

42:38.723 --> 42:40.391
(dark, ominous music)

42:40.425 --> 42:41.893
‐ Waverly?

42:41.926 --> 42:45.329
(echoing): Your journey is over,
Wynonna Earp.

42:51.536 --> 42:52.937
And mine has just begun.

42:52.970 --> 42:55.573
(dark music)
