10:29.000 --> 10:30.733
OH, WOULD YOU
BRING ME BACK

10:30.767 --> 10:32.800
ONE OF THOSE X-RAY
PICTURES OF THE BABY?

10:32.833 --> 10:33.800
PLEASE?

10:33.833 --> 10:35.567
OKAY.

10:35.600 --> 10:36.900
I LOVE YOU.

10:36.933 --> 10:38.167
THANKS FOR BREAKFAST.

10:38.200 --> 10:39.500
YOU'RE WELCOME.

10:39.533 --> 10:43.233
COVER OF THE NEW YORK TIMES
MAGAZINE.

10:43.267 --> 10:44.533
[LAUGHS]

10:44.567 --> 10:45.900
PRETTY GOOD, HUH, SHANE?

10:45.933 --> 10:48.533
YEAH, IT'S PRETTY GREAT.

10:51.500 --> 10:52.967
I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU REQUESTED ME, THOUGH.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.433
YOU DO HAIR, DON'T YOU?

10:54.467 --> 10:56.300
APPARENTLY

10:56.333 --> 10:58.000
THAT'S YOUR LIFE'S AMBITION.

10:59.467 --> 11:00.500
DON'T FUCK WITH ME, VERONICA.

11:00.533 --> 11:02.067
HOW AM I FUCKING WITH YOU

11:02.067 --> 11:04.967
WHEN I OFFER YOU THE WORLD
ON A SILVER PLATTER?

11:05.067 --> 11:05.967
WHAT'S SO WRONG

11:06.067 --> 11:08.067
WITH SEEING
THE POTENTIAL IN SOMEBODY

11:08.067 --> 11:09.067
AND GIVING THEM
A CHANCE

11:09.067 --> 11:10.067
TO MAKE SOMETHING
OF THEMSELVES?

11:12.300 --> 11:14.533
DID I UNDERESTIMATE YOU,
SHANE,

11:14.567 --> 11:17.233
OR DID I JUST MISTAKE YOU
FOR A PERSON OF SUBSTANCE?

11:17.267 --> 11:19.900
NO.

11:19.933 --> 11:22.467
I THINK YOU MISTOOK ME
FOR ONE OF YOUR LITTLE TRICKS

11:22.500 --> 11:24.067
WHO WOULD LET YOU
SLAP HER AROUND

11:24.067 --> 11:25.233
AND BE GRATEFUL
FOR THE PRIVILEGE

11:25.267 --> 11:26.633
OF TAKING YOUR SHIT.

11:28.667 --> 11:31.333
ARE WE GETTING TO SOME
CORE ISSUES, SHANE?

11:31.367 --> 11:32.333
POOR SHANE.

11:32.367 --> 11:34.300
FUCK YOU.

11:34.333 --> 11:36.300
WHAT ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY
THAT I'M RIGHT

11:36.333 --> 11:38.733
ABOUT YOU?

11:38.767 --> 11:41.733
THAT YOU REALLY ARE BETTER
THAN THIS LIFE YOU'RE LIVING?

11:45.500 --> 11:46.633
VERONICA,

11:46.667 --> 11:49.467
LISTEN TO WHAT
I'M SAYING TO YOU.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.900
I HAVE NO MAGIC,

11:50.933 --> 11:51.933
AND THERE IS NO MOJO,

11:51.967 --> 11:52.967
SO WHATEVER IT IS

11:53.067 --> 11:54.533
THAT YOU THINK
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR,

11:54.567 --> 11:56.400
IT DOESN'T EXIST.

11:56.433 --> 11:57.933
OKAY?

12:00.333 --> 12:04.100
THEN WHY DON'T YOU
DO MY FUCKING HAIR?

12:04.133 --> 12:06.200
NO, THANK YOU.

12:18.567 --> 12:19.533
HELLO.

12:19.567 --> 12:21.467
BURR WILL BE HERE IN A MINUTE.

12:21.500 --> 12:22.633
HAVE A SEAT.

12:22.667 --> 12:24.267
I'D THOUGHT
THAT HE'D FIRED ME.

12:24.300 --> 12:25.367
I WOULDN'T LET HIM.

12:25.400 --> 12:27.867
YOU'RE TOO GOOD FOR ONE ANOTHER.

12:27.900 --> 12:28.867
ANOTHER DRINK.

12:28.900 --> 12:30.433
MORE TWIST, LESS ICE.

12:30.467 --> 12:31.833
CAN I HAVE
A CHARDONNAY, PLEASE?

12:31.867 --> 12:34.133
YOU ARE
A COMPULSIVE EXCAVATOR

12:34.167 --> 12:36.233
OF YOUR OWN EMOTIONAL
NAVEL LINT,

12:36.267 --> 12:39.467
A NIT-PICKING
OBSESSIVE TRUTH-TELLER,

12:39.500 --> 12:41.933
AND BURR COULD STAND
A BIT OF LITERARY PEDICULOSIS.

12:41.967 --> 12:42.900
EW.

12:42.933 --> 12:44.133
HMM.

12:44.167 --> 12:46.067
DOES THAT HIT
A LITTLE TOO CLOSE TO HOME?

12:46.100 --> 12:48.733
ARE WE SELF-LOATHING,
BODY MUTILATORS AS WELL?

12:48.767 --> 12:49.900
OF COURSE.

12:49.933 --> 12:51.333
I CAN'T WAIT
TO READ ABOUT THAT

12:51.367 --> 12:52.300
IN ONE OF YOUR STORIES.

12:52.333 --> 12:54.233
I HOPE
YOU'RE NOT A CUTTER.

12:54.267 --> 12:55.067
LISTEN, JENNY.

12:55.100 --> 12:56.233
YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A GIFT

12:56.267 --> 12:59.333
TO PORTRAY THE DETAILS
OF A LIFE LIVED.

12:59.367 --> 13:01.433
I THINK NON-FICTION
MAY END UP BEING YOUR METIER.

13:01.467 --> 13:05.333
IT'S WHY I WANT YOU
TO WORK WITH BURR.

13:05.367 --> 13:06.933
I DON'T WANT TO.

13:06.967 --> 13:08.433
YOU NEED
TO GET HIM TO TELL YOU STORIES.

13:08.467 --> 13:09.233
I DON'T LIKE HIM.

13:09.267 --> 13:10.167
HE'S A HOMOPHOBE.

13:10.200 --> 13:11.267
[BURR]: HI.

13:11.300 --> 13:12.267
HI. HI, DARLING.

13:12.300 --> 13:13.267
HOW ARE YOU?

13:13.300 --> 13:14.133
GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?
GOOD.

13:14.167 --> 13:15.133
HELLO.

13:15.167 --> 13:16.700
YOU REMEMBER
JENNY SCHECTER.

13:16.733 --> 13:18.300
I DO.

13:18.333 --> 13:19.300
APPARENTLY

13:19.333 --> 13:20.933
WE'RE DESTINED
FOR ONE ANOTHER.

13:22.700 --> 13:24.567
THANK YOU, SUZIE.

13:27.967 --> 13:29.100
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

13:29.133 --> 13:30.100
[WOMAN]:
WELL, HERE'S A GOOD WAY

13:30.133 --> 13:31.467
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

13:31.500 --> 13:33.300
AN INCH IN DIAMETER
IS TWO FINGERS INSIDE OF YOU.

13:33.333 --> 13:34.500
AN INCH AND A HALF

13:34.533 --> 13:36.267
IS THREE FINGERS
INSIDE OF YOU.

13:36.300 --> 13:38.167
THE SILICONE ONES
ARE EASIEST TO STERILIZE,

13:38.200 --> 13:40.067
AND SO YOU CAN SHARE.

13:40.067 --> 13:42.367
SHARE.
HOW DO YOU STERILIZE THEM?

13:42.400 --> 13:43.600
OH, JUST POP IT IN THE
DISHWASHER,

13:43.633 --> 13:45.433
BUT DON'T FORGET TO TAKE IT OUT
BEFORE THE MAID COMES.

13:45.467 --> 13:47.967
OH, LOOK,
THIS LOOKS FUN.

13:48.067 --> 13:50.067
OH, NOW,
THAT'S VERY POPULAR.

13:50.067 --> 13:51.333
EVERYONE'S A WINNER.

13:51.367 --> 13:52.333
NO?

13:52.367 --> 13:53.400
YEAH, I KIND OF WANT YOU TO--

13:53.433 --> 13:54.833
YEAH.
YOU KNOW? ANYWAY.

13:54.867 --> 13:57.100
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE TO START.

13:57.133 --> 14:00.567
THERE ARE SO MANY
SHAPES, SIZES...

14:00.600 --> 14:02.667
WELL, ARE YOU
INTO SEMI-REALISTIC, REALISTIC?

14:02.700 --> 14:04.667
THESE ONES HERE,

14:04.700 --> 14:05.600
CHAMPLETTE,
LEO, AND RANDY,

14:05.633 --> 14:06.733
ARE ALL THE SEMIS,

14:06.767 --> 14:08.500
AND UP HERE, KING KONG
AND TYRANNOSAURUS REX.

14:08.533 --> 14:10.467
THESE ARE VERY LIKE
THE REAL THING,

14:10.500 --> 14:11.533
AND THEY COME IN COLORS.

14:11.567 --> 14:13.700
THERE'S BLACK, PURPLE,
BLUE, TEAL, RED,

14:13.733 --> 14:15.600
HOT PINK, CHOCOLATE,
AND VANILLA.

14:15.633 --> 14:17.367
THERE'S COMBINATION
MARBLE-SWIRL.

14:17.400 --> 14:18.367
THERE'S DISCO GLITTER,

14:18.400 --> 14:20.500
AND KING KONG
AND TYRANNOSAURUS REX

14:20.533 --> 14:22.167
BOTH COME IN CAMOUFLAGE.

14:22.200 --> 14:24.400
IN CASE YOU'RE
SCREWING IN A WAR ZONE.

14:24.433 --> 14:25.200
OH, LOOK!

14:25.233 --> 14:27.433
HAIRY BALLS.

14:27.467 --> 14:28.433
OH, THAT'S JUST WRONG.

14:28.467 --> 14:29.367
IF YOU LOOK
AT THE BASE,

14:29.400 --> 14:31.067
THEY COME WITH A SUCTION CUP,

14:31.067 --> 14:32.533
AND THAT WAY
IT MAKES THEM EASY TO ATTACH

14:32.567 --> 14:33.700
TO THE HOTEL WINDOW.

14:36.300 --> 14:37.933
OH, LOOK.

14:39.967 --> 14:41.467
[SWAGGERING]:
HEY.

14:41.500 --> 14:44.467
NO, THAT'S A BUTT PLUG.

14:44.500 --> 14:45.467
THE BOYS LIKE THOSE,

14:45.500 --> 14:46.467
BECAUSE THEY GET
RIGHT INSIDE

14:46.500 --> 14:47.467
AND TICKLE THE PROSTATE.

14:47.500 --> 14:48.567
ALTHOUGH THE GIRLS
DO LIKE THEM, TOO.

14:48.600 --> 14:50.267
IF YOU USE IT
WITH A HARNESS,

14:50.300 --> 14:51.767
YOU CAN DETACH THE DILDO,

14:51.800 --> 14:55.500
LEAVE THE BUTT PLUG INSIDE
WHILE YOU DO OTHER THINGS.

14:55.533 --> 14:56.833
WHAT, LIKE,
THE DISHES?

14:56.867 --> 14:57.833
BY THE WAY,

14:57.867 --> 14:58.833
WE HAVE
A GREAT NEW LUBE.

14:58.867 --> 14:59.867
IT JUST CAME IN TODAY.

14:59.900 --> 15:02.567
I HIGHLY
RECOMMEND THIS.

15:02.600 --> 15:03.900
OH, YOU KNOW,

15:03.933 --> 15:06.100
I THINK I'M ALLERGIC
TO THAT KIND, SO...

15:06.133 --> 15:07.233
STRAWBERRIES.
WHAT?

15:07.267 --> 15:08.867
WHAT HAVEN'T YOU DONE?

15:08.900 --> 15:11.100
I HAVEN'T DONE
LOTS OF THINGS.

15:11.133 --> 15:13.067
IF YOU NEED ANY HELP,
JUST GIVE ME A SHOUT.

15:16.433 --> 15:17.633
OH, SHIT.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.267
IT'S MELANIE CAPLAN.

15:19.300 --> 15:20.533
[PULLS ZIPPER]

15:20.567 --> 15:21.533
SO?

15:21.567 --> 15:23.567
SO...

15:23.600 --> 15:25.267
WHY DON'T WE GET
A COCK RING?

15:42.100 --> 15:43.800
IS THAT OUR BABY?

15:43.833 --> 15:45.467
THAT'S YOUR BABY,

15:45.500 --> 15:48.467
AND THOSE ARE
HER FINGERS.

15:48.500 --> 15:51.400
VERY WELL FORMED,
YEAH.

15:51.433 --> 15:54.067
ISN'T SHE AMAZING?

15:55.700 --> 15:57.333
OH, IT'S LIKE
SHE'S WAVING AT US.

15:57.367 --> 15:58.700
LOOK.

15:58.733 --> 16:01.267
SHE'S SHOWING YOU
HER PROFILE.

16:12.833 --> 16:14.067
[BURR]: SO I GUESS
I'M BEING DRAGGED,

16:14.067 --> 16:17.867
KICKING AND SCREAMING,
TO A PLACE OF TOLERANCE.

16:17.900 --> 16:20.700
I DON'T REALLY LIKE THE IDEA
OF BEING TOLERATED.

16:20.733 --> 16:22.233
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH BEING TOLERATED, JENNY?

16:22.267 --> 16:23.633
IT'S BETTER THAN BEING SPAT ON.

16:23.667 --> 16:24.633
BECAUSE IT IMPLIES

16:24.667 --> 16:26.400
THAT THERE'S
SOMETHING UNACCEPTABLE

16:26.433 --> 16:28.300
ABOUT MY BEING GAY.

16:28.333 --> 16:29.633
FRANKLY,

16:29.667 --> 16:31.333
I THINK IT'S
PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE

16:31.367 --> 16:32.467
FOR A GIRL THESE DAYS.

16:32.500 --> 16:34.200
MEN ACTUALLY FIND IT HOT.

16:34.233 --> 16:36.067
WHAT'S WITH
THE DOUBLE STANDARD, BURR?

16:36.067 --> 16:38.800
OH, DON'T BE A PRICK,
CHARLOTTE.

16:38.833 --> 16:40.533
LOOK AT ANY
MALE ACTOR TODAY.

16:40.567 --> 16:41.800
THERE'S NOT
A SELF-PROCLAIMED QUEER

16:41.833 --> 16:43.200
IN THE BUNCH.

16:43.233 --> 16:44.900
PLEASE, DOES ANYBODY
GIVE A SHIT ANYMORE?

16:44.933 --> 16:45.900
THEY GIVE A SHIT.

16:45.933 --> 16:47.500
DO YOU HONESTLY THINK

16:47.533 --> 16:49.500
A STUDIO'S GOING TO PAY A GUY
WHAT THEY PAY ME

16:49.533 --> 16:50.867
IF HIS FANS
THINK HE'S A FAGGOT?

16:50.900 --> 16:52.767
ALL THE MILLIONS
YOU'VE COLLECTED OVER THE YEARS,

16:52.800 --> 16:54.167
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO LOSE?

16:54.200 --> 16:56.667
I WAS SPEAKING HYPOTHETICALLY,
DARLING.

16:56.700 --> 16:58.867
WE'RE NOT REALLY TALKING
ABOUT ME.

16:58.900 --> 17:01.767
OH, I THOUGHT WE WERE.

17:01.800 --> 17:03.300
DON'T TWIST MY WORDS,
CHARLOTTE.

17:03.333 --> 17:07.533
I KNOW YOU TAKE PLEASURE IN IT,
BUT BE WARNED, SWEETHEART.

17:07.567 --> 17:09.267
DO YOU KNOW
HOW MANY LAWSUITS I'VE WON

17:09.300 --> 17:10.633
AGAINST PEOPLE
WHO'VE TRIED TO ACCUSE ME

17:10.667 --> 17:12.200
OF WHAT YOU JUST ACCUSED ME OF?

17:12.233 --> 17:14.067
ARE YOU THREATENING ME?

17:16.367 --> 17:17.333
I THINK
YOU MIGHT WANT

17:17.367 --> 17:18.500
TO ORGANIZE
YOUR FRIENDS

17:18.533 --> 17:19.833
TO FORM A LITTLE
LEGAL DEFENSE FUND

17:19.867 --> 17:22.800
FOR THEIR
BELOVED PROFESSOR.

17:22.833 --> 17:25.067
FUCK OFF, CHARLOTTE.

17:31.067 --> 17:32.067
HEY.

17:32.067 --> 17:33.100
HEY.

17:33.133 --> 17:34.933
I WANT TO TELL YOU

17:34.967 --> 17:36.633
THAT I AGREE
WITH WHAT YOU SAID, MAN.

17:36.667 --> 17:37.633
YOU DO, HUH?

17:37.667 --> 17:38.467
I DO.

17:38.500 --> 17:39.633
BECAUSE THE THING IS,

17:39.667 --> 17:42.100
IF SOME MALE ACTOR
WERE TO COME OUT

17:42.133 --> 17:43.633
AND SAY,
"FUCK, YEAH. I'M GAY,"

17:43.667 --> 17:46.067
THAT WOULD BE, LIKE,
A HUGE GIFT TO THE WORLD,

17:46.100 --> 17:48.067
BUT IT WOULD DESTROY
THEIR FUCKING CAREER.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.733
EXACTLY RIGHT.

17:50.767 --> 17:51.967
AND DON'T WORRY
ABOUT CHARLOTTE, YOU KNOW?

17:52.067 --> 17:54.533
SHE'S AN ASSHOLE.

17:54.567 --> 17:56.467
SHE'S NOT GOD, YOU KNOW?

17:58.333 --> 17:59.500
I WOULDN'T BE
SO SURE ABOUT THAT, JENNY.

17:59.533 --> 18:01.167
[LAUGHS]

18:01.200 --> 18:02.767
JENNY, IF YOU STILL FEEL
LIKE WORKING ON THE BOOK,

18:02.800 --> 18:05.067
BE AT MY HOUSE TOMORROW NIGHT
AT 8:30.

18:18.400 --> 18:19.367
THANK YOU.

18:21.567 --> 18:23.267
THAT WAS REALLY NICE.

18:23.300 --> 18:26.433
THANK YOU.

18:26.467 --> 18:29.167
I REALLY LOVED
BEING THERE WITH YOU.

18:29.200 --> 18:31.100
I LOVED IT
MORE THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE.

18:33.967 --> 18:36.100
COME HERE.

18:49.067 --> 18:50.867
YOU FEEL SO GOOD.

18:52.667 --> 18:54.933
YOU SMELL GOOD.

20:17.700 --> 20:19.633
[***]

20:56.733 --> 20:58.467
TOUCH ME HERE.

21:00.433 --> 21:02.067
FEEL THIS.

21:03.800 --> 21:05.733
TOUCH ME HERE.

21:08.367 --> 21:10.400
OH, MY GOD.

21:10.433 --> 21:12.933
OH, MY FUCKING GOD.

21:14.767 --> 21:16.933
ARE YOU SURE
IT'S OKAY?

22:12.467 --> 22:14.267
[GASPING]

22:45.733 --> 22:48.700
I DON'T KNOW, BABE.

22:48.733 --> 22:50.133
I THINK IT LOOKS
LITTLE DYKE-ISH.

22:50.167 --> 22:51.667
WELCOME
TO THE CLUB.

22:51.700 --> 22:52.967
[CHUCKLES]

22:53.067 --> 22:55.433
I'M JOKING.
I LIKE IT A LOT.

22:55.467 --> 22:57.300
SO, WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK
THAT BITCH WANTED FROM YOU?

46:58.067 --> 47:00.967
YOU MEAN YOU--
YOU'VE BEEN SEEING EACH OTHER

47:01.067 --> 47:02.867
FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS?

47:02.900 --> 47:04.200
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'VE GOT TO WORK.

47:04.233 --> 47:09.167
SEEMS LIKE YOU TWO
HAVE SOME UNFINISHED BUSINESS.

47:12.567 --> 47:16.067
YOU'VE BEEN DOING MISS THANG
AND TRYING TO ROMANCE ME?

47:16.067 --> 47:18.100
KIT, YOU'RE GOING DOWN
A REAL BAD ROAD HERE.

47:18.133 --> 47:20.833
OH, IT'S A VERY BAD ROAD,
A ROAD OF LIES.

47:20.867 --> 47:22.067
WE NEVER DISCUSSED MONOGAMY,
OKAY?

47:22.100 --> 47:24.100
WE DIDN'T GET
THAT FAR,

47:24.133 --> 47:25.767
BUT IF WE HAD,
I WOULD'VE EXPLAINED TO YOU

47:25.800 --> 47:27.333
THAT IT JUST DOESN'T
WORK FOR ME.

47:27.367 --> 47:29.200
AND I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
TO FUCK OFF.

47:29.233 --> 47:30.567
KIT, I'M NOT TRYING
TO WIN AN ARGUMENT HERE,

47:30.600 --> 47:32.667
BUT DIDN'T YOU JUST STAND UP
IN A MEETING

47:32.700 --> 47:33.667
AND ANNOUNCE

47:33.700 --> 47:34.933
THAT YOU'RE SEEING
A MARRIED MAN?

47:34.967 --> 47:37.167
OH, DON'T YOU EVEN GO THERE.

47:37.200 --> 47:38.533
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE

47:38.567 --> 47:40.167
BETTER NOT EVEN TRY
TO PASS JUDGMENT.

47:40.200 --> 47:42.567
YOU ARE DECEIVING SOMEONE,
OKAY?

47:42.600 --> 47:44.200
YOU'RE LYING TO SOMEBODY'S WIFE.

47:44.233 --> 47:47.533
AND THE WAY YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE?

47:47.567 --> 47:49.933
LET ME GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE,
ALL RIGHT?

47:59.100 --> 48:00.100
EXCUSE ME.

48:05.967 --> 48:09.367
I'M SUCH A FUCKING IDIOT.

48:09.400 --> 48:10.500
I SHOULD'VE--

48:10.533 --> 48:11.500
IT WAS SO OBVIOUS

48:11.533 --> 48:14.467
THAT ALL OF THIS
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.

48:14.500 --> 48:16.867
IT HAPPENS, JENNY.

48:16.900 --> 48:19.233
IT DOESN'T MAKE YOU AN IDIOT.

48:19.267 --> 48:23.067
EVERY TIME I THINK
EVERYTHING'S GOING REALLY WELL,

48:23.067 --> 48:27.533
AND EVEN IF I TRY REALLY HARD,

48:27.567 --> 48:30.600
IT ALL FUCKS UP.

48:33.067 --> 48:36.100
AND I THINK THAT...

48:36.133 --> 48:37.767
MAYBE I'M JUST
ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE

48:37.800 --> 48:42.233
THAT DOESN'T DESERVE
TO BE HAPPY.

48:42.267 --> 48:44.367
BULLSHIT.

48:44.400 --> 48:45.800
EVERYONE DESERVES TO BE HAPPY.

48:45.833 --> 48:47.567
I DON'T KNOW.

48:47.600 --> 48:48.600
WE ALL DO.

48:48.633 --> 48:50.067
WE ALL DESERVE
TO BE HAPPY, JENNY.

48:50.067 --> 48:51.500
MOST OF US JUST
DON'T HAVE THE BALLS

48:51.533 --> 48:53.667
TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR IT.

48:53.700 --> 48:55.567
YOU'RE FACING YOUR DEMONS
HEAD ON,

48:55.600 --> 48:58.400
AND THAT IS SOMETHING
I'VE NEVER DONE.

48:58.433 --> 49:02.633
YOU WANT TO LOOK AT SOMEONE
WHO'S FUCKED UP THEIR LIFE?

49:02.667 --> 49:04.667
TAKE A LOOK AT ME.

49:06.733 --> 49:08.400
WHAT DID YOU DO?

49:13.833 --> 49:15.833
OKAY, I'M GOING TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING NOW.

49:15.867 --> 49:16.833
[SNIFFLES]

49:16.867 --> 49:18.200
OKAY.

49:22.900 --> 49:24.900
MY LIFE ENDED 20 YEARS AGO,

49:24.933 --> 49:26.333
WHEN I DESTROYED THE ONE PERSON

49:26.367 --> 49:28.533
WHO MEANT ANYTHING TO ME
IN THE WORLD

49:28.567 --> 49:31.267
BECAUSE I WAS TOO FUCKING SCARED
TO BE HAPPY.

49:35.933 --> 49:38.800
HE HAD A GOOD CAREER, TOO.

49:38.833 --> 49:40.433
HE DIDN'T DESERVE
TO GO DOWN LIKE THAT.

49:47.367 --> 49:50.967
ROD SEBRING, RIGHT?

49:52.933 --> 49:56.100
LOVE OF MY LIFE.

50:03.933 --> 50:05.433
YOU'RE A FAG.

50:07.167 --> 50:08.500
YEP.

50:08.533 --> 50:12.833
CARD-CARRYING MEMBER
OF THE COCKSUCKERS' CLUB.

50:12.867 --> 50:14.100
YEAH.

50:18.000 --> 50:19.933
WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM?

50:22.567 --> 50:24.900
I HAD MY PUBLICIST
PLANT AN ITEM IN THE TABLOIDS

50:24.933 --> 50:27.400
AFTER I CAUGHT HIM
FUCKING A P.A.

50:33.100 --> 50:34.867
CAN'T SAY I BLAME HIM
FOR SCREWING THE KID.

50:34.900 --> 50:36.967
I MEAN,
I MADE HIM SO FUCKING MISERABLE.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
WHY WOULD YOU
DO THAT

50:38.033 --> 50:43.200
IF YOU LOVED HIM SO MUCH?

50:43.233 --> 50:45.733
I LOVED HIM SO MUCH.

50:47.533 --> 50:49.267
AND NOW I'VE GOT
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

50:49.300 --> 50:50.267
KISSING MY ASS.

50:50.300 --> 50:52.000
EVERYBODY LOVES ME.

50:52.033 --> 50:54.133
I FUCK WHO I WANT TO FUCK.

50:54.167 --> 50:55.000
IT'S SECRET.

50:55.033 --> 50:57.767
ANONYMOUS, YOU KNOW.

50:57.800 --> 51:00.600
I PAY THEM OR THREATEN THEM
TO KEEP QUIET...

51:02.767 --> 51:04.633
AND I'M ALONE.

51:09.567 --> 51:10.833
YOU GOT IT RIGHT,
GIRL.

51:10.867 --> 51:12.867
BELIEVE ME.

51:16.567 --> 51:17.633
I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW

51:17.667 --> 51:21.267
WHAT THE FUCK
I WAS SO AFRAID OF.

51:27.600 --> 51:32.167
IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

51:34.567 --> 51:36.667
DO YOU KNOW WHY?

51:38.900 --> 51:40.900
YOU'RE SO LOVELY.

51:44.500 --> 51:47.600
I'M AFRAID IT IS TOO LATE,
JENNY.

51:47.633 --> 51:49.800
IT IS, FOR ME.

51:49.833 --> 51:53.800
I'M NOT LIKE YOU.

51:53.833 --> 51:58.467
NOW, YOU DO REALIZE, OF COURSE,
THAT YOU'RE FIRED.

51:58.500 --> 52:00.300
PLEASE DON'T FIRE ME.
NO.

52:00.333 --> 52:03.100
I CAN'T BE FIRED
FROM ANOTHER JOB.

52:03.133 --> 52:04.100
[SNIFFLES]

52:04.133 --> 52:06.267
YOU DON'T WANT TO WORK WITH ME.

52:06.300 --> 52:07.467
YOU'RE TOO DAMN GOOD

52:07.500 --> 52:08.933
TO BE CHURNING OUT
SOME PRESS KIT PABLUM

52:08.967 --> 52:10.700
FOR AN OLD CLOSET QUEEN, HMM?

52:10.733 --> 52:14.100
YOU ARE GOING TO
COME UP WITH SOMETHING.

52:14.133 --> 52:17.200
I FEEL IT RADIATING FROM YOU,

52:17.233 --> 52:20.533
BUT HEAR THIS--

52:20.567 --> 52:24.433
IF YOU'RE EVER TEMPTED,

52:24.467 --> 52:29.067
AND I READ SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS ANYWHERE,

52:29.067 --> 52:30.367
I WILL HAVE YOU KILLED.

52:32.533 --> 52:33.933
YOU THINK I'M KIDDING?

52:33.967 --> 52:34.933
NO.

52:34.967 --> 52:36.200
GOOD, BECAUSE I'M NOT.

52:44.467 --> 52:46.200
THEY JUST FINISHED IT
THIS MORNING.

52:46.233 --> 52:48.267
THIS IS WILSON'S ROOM.

52:52.500 --> 52:57.133
JUN YING HAS ALWAYS
WANTED A CANOPY.

52:57.167 --> 52:59.467
I THINK SHE THINKS
SHE'S MARIE ANTOINETTE.

52:59.500 --> 53:02.833
OH, GOD. LET'S HOPE
LADY GUINEVERE OR SOMETHING.

53:13.067 --> 53:15.400
THEY'RE LUCKY KIDS.

53:15.433 --> 53:18.433
MM.

53:21.333 --> 53:23.733
THERE'S ONE MORE.

53:23.767 --> 53:25.100
ONE MORE?

53:27.100 --> 53:30.267
FOR YOU...

53:30.300 --> 53:32.433
AND FOR HER.

53:45.200 --> 53:47.533
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

53:47.567 --> 53:51.067
IT'S...
IT'S DAZZLING.

53:51.067 --> 53:53.633
IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL.

53:53.667 --> 53:58.067
IT IS TRULY AMAZING. I...

53:59.600 --> 54:01.667
BUT, HELENA...

54:07.433 --> 54:11.333
IT'S FOR WHEN
YOU BOTH STAY.

54:11.367 --> 54:13.600
I JUST...

54:13.633 --> 54:17.500
I DID IT
BECAUSE I WANTED TO.

54:17.533 --> 54:19.467
OKAY?

54:28.600 --> 54:31.967
I HOPE YOU LIKE IT...

54:32.067 --> 54:33.967
BOTH OF YOU.

54:34.067 --> 54:35.933
[***]

54:50.333 --> 54:51.367
WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

54:51.400 --> 54:52.467
WHAT KIND OF FASHION SHOW?

54:52.500 --> 54:54.333
[DANA]: JUST-- JUST HANG ON.

54:54.367 --> 54:55.600
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
DO YOU NEED HELP?

54:55.633 --> 54:56.800
NO, NO, NO, AL.

ONE OF THOSE MIU MIU THINGS

55:07.233 --> 55:10.367
WHERE YOU DON'T KNOW
WHERE THE STRAPS GO?

OKAY, ARE YOU READY?
