00:45.526 --> 00:48.233
The federal appeals court just
turned him down.

00:48.268 --> 00:49.816
So we're a "go."

00:49.851 --> 00:51.461
Where's Ray Kaspo?

00:51.496 --> 00:54.818
He's in the holding cell having
his last meal...

00:54.853 --> 00:56.778
ribs and chili.

00:56.813 --> 00:58.833
Ribs and chili?

00:59.647 --> 01:02.266
That might kill him before we do.

01:25.426 --> 01:27.284
Hey, Ray, how you doin'?

01:27.319 --> 01:30.078
I'm good. I'm okay.

01:30.113 --> 01:31.876
I had 'em add a ton of extra sauce.

01:31.911 --> 01:33.666
I told them that's how you liked it.

01:33.701 --> 01:34.926
Thanks, Abbie.

01:35.441 --> 01:37.208
I, uh...

01:37.243 --> 01:39.710
I heard about the appeals court.

01:39.995 --> 01:40.918
Bastards.

01:40.953 --> 01:43.956
Yeah, well, I'm not surprised.

01:45.561 --> 01:47.628
Story of my life.

01:48.435 --> 01:49.690
Hey.

01:56.398 --> 01:58.507
Why don't you give that to
your daughter?

01:58.542 --> 02:00.811
You told me she likes to draw.

02:01.266 --> 02:03.498
- Your paint set.
- Well...

02:03.533 --> 02:06.335
I didn't have anybody else to give it to.

02:10.132 --> 02:12.306
Thanks for everything, Abbie.

02:13.264 --> 02:15.587
You stay strong, man.

02:20.133 --> 02:21.810
Hey, Abbie,

02:21.845 --> 02:23.750
tell the guys...

02:23.785 --> 02:25.764
tell everybody...

02:26.106 --> 02:28.659
I'm at peace.

02:30.715 --> 02:32.537
See ya, Ray.

02:48.908 --> 02:51.312
Hey, guard! Guard, get in here!
Open it up!

02:51.347 --> 02:52.324
Hurry!

02:56.529 --> 02:59.373
Okay, we're ready...

03:00.288 --> 03:02.052
He's been poisoned.

03:02.087 --> 03:03.725
Poisoned?

03:04.842 --> 03:06.850
Why?

03:12.691 --> 03:15.525
MONK Season 2 Epi. 16
Mr. Monk Goes to Jail

04:25.374 --> 04:27.839
Hey, you okay?

04:29.103 --> 04:30.952
Well, you've been inside a prison
before, right?

04:30.987 --> 04:34.743
I've been to holding cells and
visiting rooms.

04:34.778 --> 04:36.923
They were bad enough.

04:37.921 --> 04:39.294
All right, come on.

04:41.411 --> 04:44.059
Hi, uh, Adrian Monk, Sharona Fleming.

04:44.094 --> 04:47.729
- Captain Stottlemeyer's expecting us.
- All right, keep these on.

04:47.764 --> 04:50.815
This is how we tell the good guys
from the bad guys.

04:51.327 --> 04:54.286
- And you'll step right this way.
- Okay, thanks.

04:59.356 --> 05:00.636
Let's go.

05:06.500 --> 05:08.607
Step over here for me, please.

05:09.389 --> 05:10.650
Raise your arms, palms up, please.

05:10.685 --> 05:12.743
What-What are... What are you doing?

05:12.778 --> 05:14.747
I have to pat you down.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.477
Just raise your arms.

05:16.512 --> 05:17.965
Palms up.

05:18.285 --> 05:20.589
Very good. Turn around for me.

05:21.450 --> 05:24.289
No, not-not in a circle.
Face the wall.

05:27.751 --> 05:28.605
There you go.

05:28.640 --> 05:29.440
Aah!

05:29.475 --> 05:34.100
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

05:34.192 --> 05:35.574
Wait.

05:40.021 --> 05:41.748
Okay.

05:41.783 --> 05:42.585
Aah!

05:42.620 --> 05:45.570
Okay, wait a second.
Wait. Whoa. Stop.

05:46.081 --> 05:49.542
Just a minute.
Just a second.

05:55.185 --> 05:58.425
O-O-O-O-Okay. Go ahead.

05:59.054 --> 06:00.079
Aah!

06:01.453 --> 06:02.637
What are you trying to prove?

06:02.672 --> 06:03.931
- What are you doing?
- I can't.

06:03.966 --> 06:05.013
Yes, you can.

06:05.048 --> 06:08.413
- This is...
- You're acting like a child.

06:12.387 --> 06:14.498
Sorry.

06:21.542 --> 06:22.575
Okay.

06:22.976 --> 06:24.480
Aah!
Wait! Okay.

06:24.515 --> 06:27.510
Wait, wait, wait. All right, here.
How about this?

06:27.545 --> 06:29.414
I'll pat myself down.

06:29.449 --> 06:30.946
You're gonna pat yourself down?

06:30.981 --> 06:32.080
I'm an honest man.

06:32.115 --> 06:34.057
I'm an ex-cop.
You can trust me.

06:34.092 --> 06:36.175
You're an ex-cop?

07:23.803 --> 07:25.106
Wait. Wait, wait.

07:25.141 --> 07:27.806
What's this?
Oh, hey, hold on a second.

07:28.479 --> 07:30.973
What is this? Nail clippers?

07:31.008 --> 07:33.322
Where do I think I'm goin' with these?

07:33.357 --> 07:35.540
Can't bring that in here.

07:36.014 --> 07:38.964
I'll get these back when I leave.

07:40.114 --> 07:42.325
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

07:44.632 --> 07:45.991
Hey, Monk.

07:48.456 --> 07:50.386
The crime scene is in here.

07:50.421 --> 07:53.744
I'm-I'm fine. I'm good.
I-I can see it from here.

07:53.779 --> 07:55.685
Who-Who made the chili?

07:55.720 --> 07:57.887
We did, in our own kitchen.

07:57.922 --> 08:00.316
I got Detective Leveaugh
talking to the cooks.

08:00.351 --> 08:01.715
I think that's a bust.

08:01.750 --> 08:04.870
- Who brought him the food?
- A trustee named Abernathy.

08:04.905 --> 08:07.783
He's one of Kaspo's closest friends.
I just talked to him.

08:07.818 --> 08:10.512
He's real upset about this,
but I think he's clean.

08:10.547 --> 08:11.948
What did Ray Kaspo do?

08:11.983 --> 08:15.285
Six years ago, he shot a gas station
attendant in a robbery.

08:15.320 --> 08:18.471
Well, maybe the victim's family
did it for revenge.

08:18.506 --> 08:21.556
No, no. That letter is
from the victim's family.

08:21.591 --> 08:24.351
They say they forgive him...
that they're praying for him.

08:24.386 --> 08:26.059
Well, maybe they lied.

08:26.094 --> 08:27.974
No. Their name is Lapp.

08:28.009 --> 08:31.388
They're from Strasburg, Pennsylvania.
They're Mennonite.

08:31.423 --> 08:32.816
Pacifists.

08:32.851 --> 08:34.818
They don't believe in violence.

08:34.852 --> 08:37.625
I think you're right, but that still leaves
us with the big question:

08:37.659 --> 08:43.020
Why would anybody bother to spike
a condemned prisoner's last meal?

08:43.054 --> 08:44.417
His last meal?

08:44.452 --> 08:48.415
He was scheduled to be
executed at midnight.

08:48.450 --> 08:50.977
- What do you think?
- I think I'm out of here.

08:51.012 --> 08:53.591
- I'm going home.
- Adrian!

08:53.626 --> 08:55.584
I'm not sure it matters
who killed this guy.

08:55.619 --> 08:57.993
He was gonna die
in 45 minutes anyway.

08:58.028 --> 08:59.860
Sharona, I hate this place.

08:59.895 --> 09:02.187
I-I-I can't breathe in here.
It's like...

09:02.222 --> 09:05.477
- It's like a prison.
- It is a prison!

09:06.429 --> 09:09.474
- Leaving so soon?
- Not soon enough.

09:10.394 --> 09:13.007
Could you open the gate, please?

09:18.908 --> 09:21.333
Main gate. - Could you open
the gate, please?

09:21.368 --> 09:23.811
Yeah, he's still here.
It's for you.

09:32.210 --> 09:33.691
Hello?

09:42.550 --> 09:46.620
Adrian Monk, as I live and breathe.

09:46.655 --> 09:48.861
- Dale the Whale.
- Hey, come in.

09:48.896 --> 09:50.273
The door's open.

09:50.308 --> 09:53.906
Apparently, they don't consider me
much of an escape risk.

09:53.941 --> 09:56.075
Hey, hey, hey! Wipe your feet.

09:56.110 --> 09:58.669
They just cleaned my carpet.

10:01.492 --> 10:03.791
You're looking well.

10:03.826 --> 10:06.580
Oh, you smooth talker.

10:06.615 --> 10:07.490
Oh!

10:07.525 --> 10:11.405
You brought the irrepressible
Sharona Fleming.

10:11.440 --> 10:14.093
Uh, are you guys hungry?

10:14.128 --> 10:15.710
Would you like an egg roll?

10:15.745 --> 10:17.405
It's not the best,

10:17.440 --> 10:19.418
but it's the only one that delivers.

10:19.453 --> 10:21.782
Okay, hit me.

10:23.509 --> 10:26.142
Ah.! You slut.!
It's cold.!

10:26.177 --> 10:27.640
Nuke it!

10:29.183 --> 10:31.185
It seems prison agrees with you, Dale.

10:31.220 --> 10:34.412
Well, and why wouldn't it?
After all,

10:34.447 --> 10:37.993
I've been inside this
prison all of my life.

10:38.028 --> 10:39.453
That's very poetic.

10:39.488 --> 10:42.585
Well, of course, it doesn't compare with
the prison you built for yourself.

10:42.620 --> 10:46.699
What is it you want, Dale?
You said it was important.

10:46.734 --> 10:49.171
Well, there's the Adrian Monk
we know and love.

10:49.206 --> 10:55.918
Your fear is huge,
but your curiosity is huger.

10:56.299 --> 10:59.594
- I wanna make you an offer.
- Oh, please, drop dead.

10:59.629 --> 11:02.688
Well, you'd think I would have by now,
wouldn't you?

11:02.723 --> 11:04.342
Please, let's get out of here.
Come on.

11:04.377 --> 11:08.062
You help me, I'll help you.

11:08.097 --> 11:11.691
One hand washes the other.

11:11.726 --> 11:15.305
Now, there's a metaphor
I know you can relate to.

11:15.491 --> 11:19.189
As you know, a man was murdered
in here last night. - Come on.

11:19.224 --> 11:22.913
Soon, the police, who are not
as imaginative as you,

11:22.948 --> 11:25.866
will begin to focus on me.

11:25.901 --> 11:27.921
I had a motive.

11:28.107 --> 11:30.984
The young man owed me $1,200.

11:31.019 --> 11:33.702
You wouldn't kill anyone for $1,200.

11:33.737 --> 11:35.639
Well, you know that, but they don't.

11:35.674 --> 11:37.653
They've already questioned me twice.

11:37.688 --> 11:39.341
Here's my problem.

11:39.376 --> 11:42.208
As you can see, I have, uh,

11:42.243 --> 11:45.923
become accustomed to a certain
standard of living in here.

11:45.958 --> 11:48.201
And until this case is solved,

11:48.236 --> 11:50.908
things are gonna be very difficult for me.

11:50.943 --> 11:52.417
For example,

11:52.452 --> 11:56.556
they were supposed to install
a window in that wall,

11:56.591 --> 12:00.320
right there, so I could watch the sun set.

12:00.355 --> 12:05.267
I assume the sun still sets every evening.

12:06.479 --> 12:09.037
Adrian Monk...

12:09.578 --> 12:13.659
I want my window!

12:13.694 --> 12:16.936
Get me my window.!

12:17.709 --> 12:19.976
How?

12:21.076 --> 12:24.551
Stay here.
Solve the case.

12:24.586 --> 12:27.936
Forget about it. We're not gonna
work for you, and we never will.

12:27.971 --> 12:29.164
Right?

12:30.212 --> 12:32.334
Right?

12:39.086 --> 12:41.927
In exchange for what?

12:41.962 --> 12:45.616
What you want, Adrian.

12:45.651 --> 12:48.931
What you need...

12:48.966 --> 12:51.506
information.

12:51.541 --> 12:53.844
You solve this murder,

12:53.879 --> 12:59.445
and I tell you everything I know about
the man who killed your wife.

13:00.620 --> 13:01.913
Huh?

13:08.662 --> 13:11.241
You really think Dale the Whale's
gonna help you?

13:11.276 --> 13:13.562
He hates you.
You're the reason why he's in here.

13:13.597 --> 13:16.942
I have nothing to lose and
everything to gain.

13:16.977 --> 13:20.456
This is about Trudy now.
I need you to help me focus.

13:20.491 --> 13:22.392
Mr. Monk, you were asking
about our kitchen.

13:22.427 --> 13:24.223
It's right down here.

13:24.580 --> 13:26.659
I know you spoke to Dale Biederbeck.

13:26.694 --> 13:28.114
He's on our list of suspects.

13:28.149 --> 13:31.385
Sir, I really don't think he's
involved in this. - It's inexplicable.

13:31.420 --> 13:34.960
Why would anyone murder a condemned
prisoner one hour before his execution?

13:34.995 --> 13:37.075
Maybe somebody was trying
to shut him up.

13:37.110 --> 13:39.594
They were afraid he was gonna
confess something in the last minute.

13:39.629 --> 13:41.814
Doubtful. Ray Kaspo had
recently found religion.

13:41.849 --> 13:44.996
He was calling reporters every day
apologizing for his sins,

13:45.031 --> 13:47.084
confessing to whatever he had ever done.

13:47.119 --> 13:49.346
The boy was all talked out.

13:49.381 --> 13:51.737
Excuse me. Ex... Ex...

13:58.047 --> 14:00.844
- Thanks, man.
- You're welcome.

14:04.836 --> 14:06.814
We can get you a smaller sweatshirt.

14:06.849 --> 14:08.205
Oh, no, I'm fine, thanks.

14:08.240 --> 14:11.771
Our kitchen staff prepares over
1,100 meals a day here.

14:11.806 --> 14:13.571
That's more than most hotels.

14:13.606 --> 14:15.466
- How's the food?
- Well, it must be good.

14:15.501 --> 14:18.601
Everybody here is a repeat customer.

14:19.342 --> 14:23.246
Who prepared Mr. Kaspo's last meal?

14:23.281 --> 14:24.657
I did.

14:24.692 --> 14:28.358
The chili was sitting on that stove
for an hour.

14:28.393 --> 14:31.666
Anybody in the kitchen could
have spiked it.

14:35.334 --> 14:39.448
- What are you looking at?
- Uh, there's one, uh...

14:39.483 --> 14:42.039
- It's dangling.
- What's it to you?

14:42.074 --> 14:44.959
- Maybe-Maybe you could tuck it in.
- Why should I?

14:44.994 --> 14:47.963
It's-It's-It's distracting to all of us.

14:47.998 --> 14:50.364
- I think I'm speaking for everyone here.
- Hey, hey.

14:50.399 --> 14:53.308
Remember why we're here, okay?

14:53.475 --> 14:57.018
Come on. - Did you know the
condemned prisoner... Ray Kaspo?

14:57.053 --> 15:00.453
Never laid eyes on him.
I had no beef against the guy.

15:00.488 --> 15:02.963
And if I did, hell,
I'd just wait until midnight,

15:02.998 --> 15:06.627
let the State do the dirty deed for me.
Mm-hmm.

15:07.021 --> 15:09.642
- I think if you put...
- Do you love me?

15:09.677 --> 15:12.196
- No, no, I...
- Then don't be touchin' me!

15:12.231 --> 15:14.806
Please, please.
Stand here. Please?

15:15.015 --> 15:19.923
- Hey, hey. You've been in rehab, right?
- How did you know?

15:19.958 --> 15:22.139
I'm a nurse.
I can see the track marks.

15:22.174 --> 15:25.054
So you know about addiction, right? Okay.

15:25.089 --> 15:28.260
Well, my boss has
a jones for neatness, okay?

15:28.295 --> 15:29.977
It's my jones.

15:30.012 --> 15:33.466
And he needs a fix real bad.

15:33.650 --> 15:36.174
You talkin' about my hair?

15:36.209 --> 15:38.744
You know what it's like.

15:39.868 --> 15:42.683
It's the worst feeling in the world.

15:49.865 --> 15:51.282
Sorry, brother.

15:51.317 --> 15:52.817
Thank you, brother.

15:53.252 --> 15:55.631
Not like that. Like this.

15:58.554 --> 16:01.129
Can you get a wipe?
I think we're almost done.

16:01.566 --> 16:05.291
Mr. Monk, do you have
any other questions?

16:05.326 --> 16:08.136
Uh, just-just one.

16:08.171 --> 16:09.565
Just one.

16:09.850 --> 16:13.204
Where is Mr. Tucker?

16:13.368 --> 16:16.061
According to this time card,

16:16.096 --> 16:18.597
he didn't punch out yesterday.

16:18.632 --> 16:20.265
Well, the last time I seen him,

16:20.300 --> 16:24.017
he was in the auxiliary freezer
doing inventory.

16:31.798 --> 16:33.562
I want a total lockdown.

16:33.597 --> 16:35.693
Call the medical examiner.

16:35.907 --> 16:38.521
What the hell is going on?

16:38.556 --> 16:41.045
Check his pockets.

16:44.485 --> 16:46.583
Somebody paid him to poison the chili.

16:46.618 --> 16:49.396
- And then had second thoughts.
- They were afraid he'd talk.

16:49.431 --> 16:51.875
At least we know how
the meal was poisoned.

16:51.910 --> 16:55.917
But we still don't know
who was behind it, or why.

16:55.952 --> 16:57.602
Excuse me, Mr. Monk.

16:57.637 --> 16:59.260
This is for you.

17:04.508 --> 17:07.169
Yes, "from a volcano."
It's a metaphor.

17:07.204 --> 17:09.271
Hey, hey, hey. Look who died.

17:09.306 --> 17:12.614
- Lambert Lawson, of kidney failure.
- I heard.

17:12.648 --> 17:14.753
Five billion dollars.

17:14.789 --> 17:16.682
Wonder who's gonna get it?

17:16.717 --> 17:18.367
Not us.

17:18.402 --> 17:22.265
Mr. Monk and, uh, Miss Fleming,
I presume?

17:22.300 --> 17:24.135
Ma'am, did you send me this note?

17:24.170 --> 17:27.285
Yes. I'm Sylvia Fairbourn.
I run the reading program here.

17:27.319 --> 17:29.022
Oh, excuse me one minute.

17:29.057 --> 17:32.152
Terry, why don't you take that
book and keep it?

17:32.187 --> 17:34.849
Uh, I have lots of copies.
It's my favorite book.

17:34.884 --> 17:36.978
And you can read chapter seven
on your own?

17:37.013 --> 17:38.911
- You mean, read it without you?
- Oh, you can do it.

17:38.946 --> 17:40.817
You remind me of my son Jimmy.

17:40.852 --> 17:43.709
He wasn't very good in school,
but I wouldn't let him quit.

17:43.744 --> 17:44.699
Okay, Mrs. F.

17:44.734 --> 17:47.124
- I'll give it a shot.
- There you go.

17:48.143 --> 17:49.814
I could've used a teacher like you.

17:49.849 --> 17:52.102
Well, I haven't been at it very long,

17:52.137 --> 17:55.221
but already it's-it's the most
satisfying job I've ever had.

17:55.256 --> 17:58.743
Mrs. Fairbourn, you-you said you
had some information for me?

17:58.778 --> 18:01.578
Yes. I heard you were in here
asking about Ray Kaspo.

18:01.613 --> 18:04.611
I don't know if it means anything,
but he was in here a week ago,

18:04.646 --> 18:06.651
and I heard him talking to another inmate.

18:06.686 --> 18:08.329
What were they talking about?

18:08.364 --> 18:11.342
Well, Mr. Kaspo said that before
he was injected,

18:11.377 --> 18:15.738
he intended to tell the world
about what happened in Calgary.

18:15.773 --> 18:17.102
In Calgary? - Yes.

18:17.137 --> 18:19.002
And the other inmate said,

18:19.037 --> 18:21.491
"I'll see you in hell first."

18:21.526 --> 18:23.288
Who was the other inmate?

18:23.323 --> 18:28.214
His name is, uh, Darnell Rudner,
and I believe they call him...

18:28.249 --> 18:30.300
Spyder.

18:30.615 --> 18:33.054
Who's Spyder Rudner?

18:35.955 --> 18:38.329
I already talked to your captain.

18:38.364 --> 18:40.476
He said it's up to you.

18:41.067 --> 18:42.668
You'll have to sign this release.

18:42.703 --> 18:44.172
I'll sign whatever you want.

18:44.207 --> 18:46.658
Adrian, he's killed four people.

18:46.693 --> 18:47.799
That we know of.

18:47.834 --> 18:50.580
Spyder Rudner is evil personified.

18:50.615 --> 18:51.509
Oh, my God.!

18:51.544 --> 18:54.070
His first arrest was in the seventh grade.

18:54.105 --> 18:56.832
Are you sure you want to go
undercover as an inmate?

18:56.867 --> 18:58.305
There's no other way.

18:58.340 --> 19:00.592
If he knows I'm a cop,
he'll never talk to me.

19:00.627 --> 19:03.821
If Spyder Rudner knows
you're a cop, he'll kill you.

19:03.856 --> 19:07.807
He may kill you anyway just
because it's Wednesday.

19:09.683 --> 19:12.007
Lucky for you,
he's been in solitary all day,

19:12.042 --> 19:14.758
so he hasn't seen you around.

19:14.793 --> 19:17.112
You might get away with it
for a day or two.

19:17.147 --> 19:19.036
Why was he in solitary?

19:19.071 --> 19:21.887
He put a guy's head through a wall.

19:21.922 --> 19:23.401
Why?

19:26.719 --> 19:29.893
The guy touched his stuff.

19:34.310 --> 19:36.632
Adrian.

19:37.623 --> 19:39.972
It's for Trudy.

20:10.540 --> 20:12.009
Turn that down!

20:18.878 --> 20:20.112
Welcome home.

20:20.147 --> 20:21.539
Meet your new roommate.

20:21.574 --> 20:23.905
His name is Van Lincoln.

20:44.799 --> 20:47.434
- You got a problem.
- No, no.

20:47.469 --> 20:50.213
It's not a question.
I'm telling you.

20:50.248 --> 20:52.196
You have a problem!

20:52.231 --> 20:53.691
Listen, Mr. Spyder...

20:53.726 --> 20:54.917
Aah!

20:54.952 --> 20:57.449
Don't ever say "listen" to me!

20:57.484 --> 21:00.109
Do you understand, meat?

21:03.556 --> 21:05.633
I know why you're here.

21:05.668 --> 21:07.804
- You do?
- It's the warden.

21:07.839 --> 21:10.139
He knows I wanna be alone,

21:10.174 --> 21:14.966
so he put you here to
agitate and punish me.

21:16.942 --> 21:19.370
- What happened to my bed?
- Uh, I...

21:19.405 --> 21:21.014
Have you been touching my stuff?

21:21.049 --> 21:22.626
No, no, no. Maybe a little.

21:22.661 --> 21:25.369
I-I just...
Your sheets were all piled...

21:25.404 --> 21:27.519
You are a dead man!

21:27.554 --> 21:31.047
I am gonna gut you like a fish!

21:31.082 --> 21:33.969
Are you...
Are you looking for your shiv?

21:34.906 --> 21:37.408
Are you looking for your shiv?

21:37.899 --> 21:40.658
- I moved it.
- You what?

21:40.693 --> 21:43.031
It's in the book, in the binding.

21:43.066 --> 21:46.698
It-It-It-It's a better place to hide it.

21:46.860 --> 21:49.319
- What'd you do to it?
- I...

21:49.354 --> 21:52.991
I retaped it.
I-I-I sharpened it.

21:53.845 --> 21:56.854
You sharpened my shiv.
You made my bed.

21:56.889 --> 21:59.482
What are you in here for?

21:59.875 --> 22:02.389
Embezzlement.

22:02.960 --> 22:05.287
I'm doin' a nickel.

22:07.686 --> 22:09.409
What's a "nickel"?

22:09.444 --> 22:13.527
It means "five years."
It's prison talk.

22:13.562 --> 22:17.201
- No, it ain't.
- It is in Lompoc.

22:17.236 --> 22:19.307
Hey, give me a cigarette!

22:19.342 --> 22:20.460
Shut up.

22:20.495 --> 22:21.957
You were in Lompoc?

22:21.992 --> 22:24.664
Yeah, for a while.
Then they moved me,

22:24.699 --> 22:30.130
'cause I was too much of a bad ass.

22:30.387 --> 22:32.256
I had a friend in Lompoc...

22:32.291 --> 22:34.168
Eddie Corcoran.
Know him?

22:34.203 --> 22:36.417
Yeah. Yeah, I knew Eddie.

22:36.452 --> 22:38.727
What was he in for?

22:43.023 --> 22:46.438
He strangled his wife.

22:53.990 --> 22:56.128
You might be all right.

22:56.645 --> 22:58.817
Who's that, your old lady?

22:59.562 --> 23:01.129
Yeah.

23:02.419 --> 23:04.725
Is she waitin' for you?

23:06.276 --> 23:08.827
Yeah, she is.

23:10.317 --> 23:12.404
You're a lucky man.

23:12.439 --> 23:14.784
She'll keep you strong.

23:21.904 --> 23:23.668
Well,

23:24.057 --> 23:29.434
if it isn't "Captain Shtucklmeyer"
and his cabana boy.

23:29.469 --> 23:31.370
I'm gettin' real popular.

23:31.405 --> 23:32.835
Is this a bad time, Dale?

23:32.870 --> 23:38.098
You're here to talk to me about the late,
not so great Ray Kaspo.

23:38.133 --> 23:41.458
- How did you guess?
- Oh, I never guess, Captain.

23:41.493 --> 23:44.828
I knew you were coming before you did.

23:45.769 --> 23:47.790
Is that a bagel?

23:47.825 --> 23:50.483
Mm-hmm. Want some?

23:50.518 --> 23:53.299
Oh, uh, no, thanks.
I can't.

23:53.334 --> 23:55.614
I'm on a low-carb diet.

23:55.649 --> 23:58.119
I understand Ray Kaspo owed you
some money.

23:58.154 --> 24:00.152
Twelve hundred dollars.

24:00.187 --> 24:04.293
I wouldn't bend down to pick up $1,200.

24:04.328 --> 24:07.127
I mean, even if I could.

24:07.162 --> 24:09.985
No, I think you were trying to make
an example of him.

24:10.020 --> 24:12.397
That would be more your style.

24:13.125 --> 24:17.339
Leland Stottlemeyer is lecturing me
about style.

24:17.374 --> 24:19.307
The world has gone mad.

24:19.342 --> 24:23.160
You hired Adrian Monk to find
the real killer. Is that right?

24:23.195 --> 24:26.613
- Mm-hmm.
- And why would you do that?

24:26.648 --> 24:28.678
That's between me and Monk.

24:28.713 --> 24:31.529
Well, we heard it's because
you wanted a window.

24:31.564 --> 24:34.192
They won't install one
until the case is closed.

24:34.227 --> 24:36.242
Is a window that important to you?

24:36.277 --> 24:39.140
Try living without one.

24:41.821 --> 24:43.674
It's freezing.

24:43.709 --> 24:46.468
I feel like I'm back in Canada.

24:46.781 --> 24:49.034
- Is that where you're from?
- Yeah, Calgary.

24:49.069 --> 24:51.980
Born and raised.
You ever been?

24:52.015 --> 24:53.982
No, can't say that I have.

24:54.017 --> 24:56.524
That's not what I hear.

24:56.975 --> 25:00.996
I hear you spent some time up there
with Ray Kaspo.

25:01.460 --> 25:06.624
- Where'd you hear that?
- Around. Is it true?

25:07.836 --> 25:09.934
Maybe yes, maybe no.

25:12.298 --> 25:15.338
- Hey, what happened to my watch?
- Huh?

25:15.373 --> 25:17.410
Where the hell is my watch?

25:17.445 --> 25:19.954
It was right there!

25:25.291 --> 25:27.811
My grandfather gave me that watch.

25:27.846 --> 25:29.570
Where is it?

25:29.605 --> 25:33.737
I-I didn't take your watch.
I swear.

25:33.772 --> 25:35.455
You better not be lyin' to me.

25:35.490 --> 25:37.544
Do I look like an idiot?

25:37.690 --> 25:39.245
Listen... Look, look, look, look,

25:39.280 --> 25:42.532
look, look, look, look, Spyder.
Look, look.

25:42.750 --> 25:47.457
I'm-I'm pretty good at finding things.

25:51.738 --> 25:57.198
If I can find it... If I can find it,

25:57.233 --> 26:00.115
you-you tell me about Calgary.

26:00.150 --> 26:04.778
You find out who took the watch,
we got a deal.

26:09.747 --> 26:11.084
Hold on.

26:24.016 --> 26:27.190
I have the autopsy report right here.
It's pretty bizarre.

26:27.225 --> 26:30.066
Any idea who did this or
why they'd bother?

26:30.101 --> 26:32.368
- Not yet.
- Look at the lungs.

26:32.403 --> 26:34.053
They're completely disintegrated.

26:34.088 --> 26:37.152
We found traces of mercury,
arsenic, Benzedrine.

26:37.187 --> 26:39.843
There's enough poison in
that body to kill 10 men.

26:39.878 --> 26:42.599
- Somebody's going to be disappointed.
- What do you mean?

26:42.634 --> 26:44.890
Well, Ray Kaspo was donating
his organs to medicine.

26:44.925 --> 26:48.035
He had a rare blood type.
AB-negative with "D" antigen.

26:48.070 --> 26:49.895
But there's nothing left to donate.

26:49.930 --> 26:55.276
Every organ... the kidneys, the heart...
they've all been eaten away.

27:09.568 --> 27:13.878
Can you at least tell me
where you first met Ray Kaspo?

27:13.913 --> 27:17.249
Look, if you get my watch,

27:17.284 --> 27:19.233
then we'll talk.

27:52.793 --> 27:55.773
Hey, yo.! Little help?

27:57.164 --> 27:58.644
Uh...

28:00.013 --> 28:03.777
- Yo. You got a problem?
- Uh, I-I can't.

28:03.812 --> 28:05.150
What do you mean, you can't?

28:05.185 --> 28:07.512
Pick up the ball, homey.

28:07.833 --> 28:09.085
Are you dissin' me?

28:09.120 --> 28:12.028
No, no, no, I'm not...
I'm not dissin' you.

28:12.063 --> 28:14.394
I'm-I'm giving you your props.

28:14.429 --> 28:17.238
- Man, he clownin' you, man.
- Props are good.

28:17.273 --> 28:20.086
- Yo. Will you just...
- Stay there. Just...

28:29.976 --> 28:32.784
I haven't beaten up a white boy
in a long time.

28:32.819 --> 28:34.684
It'll come back to you.

28:34.857 --> 28:36.979
It's like ridin' a bike.

28:42.429 --> 28:45.764
Excuse me. Excuse me.

28:48.842 --> 28:51.501
- You'll thank me later.
- This is gonna be fun.

28:51.536 --> 28:53.276
Okay, but before the fun,

28:53.311 --> 28:56.412
you might wanna return
Spyder Rudner's watch.

28:56.447 --> 29:02.421
What? - The watch you stole
from his cell.

29:06.668 --> 29:11.455
Uh, you can either give it to Spyder,
or you can give it to me,

29:11.490 --> 29:14.247
or you can give it to Spyder.

29:21.605 --> 29:26.002
- You're gonna wish you were never born.
- Oh, I'm way ahead of you.

29:47.481 --> 29:50.620
It's a few minutes off.
I reset it for you.

29:51.870 --> 29:54.126
I'll take care of them later.

29:54.161 --> 29:56.428
That was pretty impressive.
How'd you know it was him?

29:56.463 --> 29:59.550
Well, I figured whoever stole your watch...

29:59.585 --> 30:02.716
would keep their sleeves rolled down,
so you couldn't see it.

30:02.751 --> 30:05.340
There were only four guys in the
whole yard with their sleeves rolled down,

30:05.375 --> 30:07.583
and he was the tallest.

30:07.618 --> 30:09.097
Why tall?

30:09.132 --> 30:12.440
The shelf in your cell is
four feet from the bars.

30:12.475 --> 30:15.172
He's the only one who could reach it.

30:15.207 --> 30:18.318
That's pretty sharp.
Now what can I do for you?

30:18.353 --> 30:24.499
All I want is for you to tell me about
Calgary and about Ray Kaspo.

30:24.534 --> 30:27.989
There's nothin' to tell.
I never met the guy,

30:28.024 --> 30:32.002
and I swear on my mother's eyes
I've never been in Calgary.

30:32.037 --> 30:34.493
Now, whoever is telling you that,

30:34.528 --> 30:37.063
they're settin' you up.

30:41.564 --> 30:44.619
How difficult was it to do research
for this book?

30:44.654 --> 30:47.167
Well, normally it's not,
but this was extremely difficult.

30:47.202 --> 30:50.955
He doesn't talk to anybody, so
I had to try to get ahold of his family...

30:51.170 --> 30:54.138
- Mr. Monk.
- You look surprised.

30:54.173 --> 30:55.910
Why would I be surprised?

30:55.945 --> 30:58.190
Maybe because Spyder Rudner
didn't kill me.

30:58.225 --> 31:00.564
Where's the friggin'remote?
'Cause we're missin'the game.

31:00.599 --> 31:02.850
I'm Jim Moret.
Welcome to Book Talk.

31:02.885 --> 31:07.042
Reclusive billionaire Lambert Lawson
died today of kidney failure.

31:07.077 --> 31:11.590
- Mrs. Fairbourn? - Our guest today
is the author of Richer Than God...

31:11.625 --> 31:13.816
Mrs. Fairbourn?

31:14.051 --> 31:18.043
- Is this a bad time?
- Yes, yes, this is a bad time.

31:19.104 --> 31:20.681
Thank you, Jim. Congratulations.

31:20.716 --> 31:22.252
This book is a huge success,

31:22.287 --> 31:25.738
and I understand it's selling
a lot better than your first book.

31:25.773 --> 31:27.252
It would be hard not to.

31:27.287 --> 31:30.598
My first book sold, like, 50 copies,

31:30.633 --> 31:33.359
and I think my mother bought 42 of them.

31:33.394 --> 31:36.642
Mrs. Fairbourn, Spyder Rudner said
he never met Ray Kaspo

31:36.677 --> 31:38.254
and had never been to Calgary.

31:38.289 --> 31:40.159
Well, Mr. Monk,
who are you going to believe,

31:40.194 --> 31:42.936
me or a man who killed four people?

31:42.971 --> 31:46.117
- Right now, we're not sure. - Mrs. F.,
have you seen the remote control?

31:46.152 --> 31:48.489
Because the knob's broke,
and we're missin' the game.

31:48.524 --> 31:50.173
No, Manny, I'm sorry.
I haven't.

31:50.208 --> 31:53.050
- Have you seen the remote?
- No.

31:54.004 --> 31:55.761
Are you calling me a liar, Mr. Monk?

31:55.796 --> 31:58.411
I think I'm calling you
a lot more than that.

31:58.446 --> 32:00.713
This is a controversial book, isn't it?

32:00.748 --> 32:04.691
Uh, I didn't think so, but, uh,
Mr. Lawson apparently did.

32:04.726 --> 32:07.962
He was suing me for 70 million dollars
when he died.

32:07.997 --> 32:10.256
So, I guess you're off the hook now?

32:10.291 --> 32:11.684
- I guess so.
- Thank you, ma'am.

32:11.719 --> 32:14.426
There could only be one reason
why you'd want Adrian dead.

32:14.461 --> 32:15.684
And why would that be?

32:15.719 --> 32:18.926
To prevent me from implicating you
in the death of Ray Kaspo.

32:18.961 --> 32:20.954
Why would I want to kill Ray Kaspo,

32:20.989 --> 32:23.555
especially on the very evening
of his execution?

32:23.590 --> 32:26.067
What could I possibly gain from that?

32:26.102 --> 32:27.374
I don't know.

32:27.409 --> 32:30.490
Well, when you find out,

32:30.742 --> 32:32.526
we could chat again.

32:32.561 --> 32:34.550
Have a good day.

32:35.128 --> 32:38.057
He ended up sheltering his whole life,
you know, with his money.

32:38.092 --> 32:43.295
He kind of kept his whole life out of the
public view, out of... out of everything.

32:43.330 --> 32:46.085
Socially, he was just... he was a hermit.

32:46.884 --> 32:47.743
That's really interesting.

32:47.778 --> 32:52.336
We'll be back with more of J. T. DeMornay
right after this. Stay with us.

32:52.755 --> 32:53.846
All right!

32:58.340 --> 33:00.619
Oh, my God.

33:09.350 --> 33:10.520
Okay.

33:11.051 --> 33:13.127
We know how, we know who,

33:13.162 --> 33:15.905
and the answer to why,
it's got to be in this book.

33:15.940 --> 33:18.023
- Has Disher called yet?
- Uh, not yet.

33:18.058 --> 33:21.089
Is this everything on Ray Kaspo?

33:21.124 --> 33:22.394
What are you looking for?

33:22.429 --> 33:25.852
Letters to or from a hospital.
He was an organ donor.

33:25.887 --> 33:28.057
Try the blue folders.

33:29.393 --> 33:30.261
Hello?

33:30.296 --> 33:32.357
Hi, it's Karen in the warden's office.

33:32.392 --> 33:34.326
- You guys are working late.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

33:34.361 --> 33:37.411
Are Mr. Monk and Miss Fleming
still there?

33:37.446 --> 33:38.626
I'm looking right at them.

33:38.661 --> 33:41.688
Well, the warden wants to see 'em
right away in the rec room.

33:41.723 --> 33:44.422
It's important.
That's all I know.

33:48.136 --> 33:51.002
Well, I'm glad I decided to stick around.

33:51.037 --> 33:53.535
I'll go. You stay here, wait for
Disher's call. - Okay.

33:53.570 --> 33:55.818
- You sure you're gonna be okay?
- I'll be fine.

33:55.853 --> 33:59.675
It's just down one, two, three,
four, five hallways.

33:59.710 --> 34:01.648
Okay, fine.

34:09.027 --> 34:10.188
Hello?

34:14.560 --> 34:16.438
Warden Christie?

34:18.138 --> 34:19.237
Hello?

34:32.947 --> 34:33.813
Hello?

34:33.848 --> 34:35.125
Hey, you were right.

34:35.159 --> 34:38.056
Lambert Lawson was
AB-negative with "D" antigen.

34:38.091 --> 34:41.295
- It's the rarest blood type in the world.
- Thanks. I'll call you later.

34:45.909 --> 34:48.391
Where's Mr. Monk?

34:52.525 --> 34:56.674
I'm guessing that was...
that was incredibly painful, huh?

34:57.849 --> 34:58.895
Hello? Yeah.

34:58.930 --> 35:03.352
There are Nazis here in the rec room.
This is a Nazi alert!

35:06.730 --> 35:08.360
The phone is dead.

35:08.395 --> 35:10.149
So are you.

35:11.502 --> 35:12.651
- The lines are cut!
- Oh, my God!

35:12.686 --> 35:15.048
Lock down the whole block.
Get security down there now.

35:15.083 --> 35:17.628
- Miss Fleming, what the hell's going on?
- It's all about him.

35:17.663 --> 35:19.017
- Lambert Lawson?
- Yes, yes.

35:19.052 --> 35:21.656
Lambert Lawson was suing the author
of this book for millions of dollars.

35:21.691 --> 35:24.810
So what? - So now that he's dead,
the lawsuit's gonna be thrown out.

35:24.845 --> 35:26.468
What the hell does a dead billionaire have

35:26.469 --> 35:28.322
to do with one of my
prisoners being poisoned?

35:28.357 --> 35:29.590
Everything, everything.

35:29.625 --> 35:32.831
Lambert Lawson died
because he needed a kidney transplant.

35:32.866 --> 35:35.213
He was AB-negative with a "D" antigen.

35:35.248 --> 35:37.594
It's the rarest blood type in the world.

35:37.629 --> 35:40.169
Guess who had the same blood type?

35:42.755 --> 35:44.671
Ray Kaspo.

35:47.332 --> 35:51.825
Okay. All right. Boys, come on.
Hey, no violence.

35:51.860 --> 35:55.107
Violence is not the answer.

36:02.170 --> 36:04.815
So Lawson was waiting for
Ray Kaspo's kidney?

36:04.850 --> 36:08.728
Right, right. Meanwhile, J. T. DeMornay,
who wrote this book, wanted Lawson dead.

36:08.763 --> 36:11.233
- DeMornay. Do I know him?
- You know his mother... Sylvia.

36:11.268 --> 36:12.505
The reading lady? - Yep.

36:12.540 --> 36:14.098
She used her maiden name
when she applied here.

36:14.133 --> 36:16.558
Here, read the dedication.

36:17.913 --> 36:23.834
"For my mother, Sylvia,
who makes all things possible."

36:25.104 --> 36:26.928
She came here to kill Ray Kaspo.

36:26.963 --> 36:29.445
She paid Tucker the cook to spike his last

36:29.446 --> 36:32.281
meal with enough poison
to destroy his organs.

36:32.316 --> 36:34.666
Wouldn't a lethal injection have ruined
the kidneys anyway?

36:34.701 --> 36:38.681
No, no. The injection attacks the
nervous system, not the organs.

36:38.716 --> 36:43.569
By destroying that kidney,
she murdered Lawson to protect her son.

36:47.009 --> 36:48.944
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

36:50.532 --> 36:51.935
Adrian!

37:05.679 --> 37:08.080
Find Mrs. Fairbourn.
Don't let her leave the prison.

37:08.115 --> 37:09.168
Come on. Follow me.

37:09.203 --> 37:10.619
Let's go! Come on!

37:15.312 --> 37:16.367
Get him!

37:22.853 --> 37:26.170
One second. I'm missing a sock here.

37:26.618 --> 37:28.327
All right, Adolf.

37:28.941 --> 37:30.558
Let him go.

37:30.593 --> 37:32.527
It's not about you, Spyder.

37:32.562 --> 37:35.141
- This guy's a friend of mine.
- He's a cop!

37:35.176 --> 37:38.013
Ah, so I've heard.
Let him go.

37:38.719 --> 37:40.790
You'd side with a cop over us?

37:40.825 --> 37:44.158
I'd side with a cucaracha over you.

37:59.676 --> 38:00.673
Get on the ground!

38:00.708 --> 38:02.665
- Yeah, right now!
- On the ground! Yeah!

38:02.700 --> 38:05.731
- Get him out of here! Come on!
- Move! Move it! Move!

38:05.766 --> 38:07.407
Get these guys out of here!

38:07.442 --> 38:08.287
Adrian!

38:08.662 --> 38:10.005
Adrian! - Sharona.

38:10.040 --> 38:12.794
- Are you okay?
- I figured out why Mrs. Fairbourn...

38:12.829 --> 38:16.086
No, no. I know, I know.
I just did the whole summation.

38:16.121 --> 38:18.156
Get 'em out of here.!

38:19.396 --> 38:20.750
Get 'em out.

38:22.204 --> 38:25.565
Spyder, you saved my life.

38:25.600 --> 38:28.321
I come up for parole in 50 years.

38:28.356 --> 38:30.172
If you're still around,

38:30.207 --> 38:33.687
why don't you come around
and tell the board all about it?

38:33.998 --> 38:36.016
I'll do that.

38:36.531 --> 38:38.305
- Get him out of here.
- Come on.

38:47.080 --> 38:48.553
Good job.

38:50.663 --> 38:52.907
Mr. M.

38:52.942 --> 38:57.557
Congratulations. - I knew you
could do it. - Thank you, Dale.

38:57.592 --> 39:01.019
It was your faith in me
that kept me going in my darkest hour.

39:01.054 --> 39:02.682
Oh, no.

39:02.717 --> 39:05.425
- I see you got your window.
- Mm-hmm.

39:05.460 --> 39:09.402
Yep. Now I can see the world,

39:09.437 --> 39:14.274
but still not be part of the world.

39:14.309 --> 39:16.163
Something else we have in common.

39:16.198 --> 39:17.989
You promised us some information.

39:18.024 --> 39:19.624
Did I?

39:28.043 --> 39:30.878
Don't make me laugh. It hurts.

39:30.913 --> 39:34.824
All right.
A deal is a deal.

39:34.859 --> 39:37.478
I'll tell you all I know.

39:37.513 --> 39:41.139
The bomb that took Trudy from you...

39:41.174 --> 39:46.284
was not intended for you.

39:46.762 --> 39:49.984
It was meant for her.

40:00.192 --> 40:01.874
Adrian.

40:01.909 --> 40:05.567
It was her... they were after.

40:05.602 --> 40:09.372
I know you've always blamed yourself
for her death.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.781
Now you don't have to.

40:11.816 --> 40:16.551
I absolve you, Adrian Monk.

40:16.848 --> 40:20.875
That's my good deed for the decade.

40:21.223 --> 40:23.241
Why?

40:23.276 --> 40:26.284
W-Why her?

40:26.319 --> 40:29.022
Oh, I can't help you there.

40:29.869 --> 40:32.741
You ever been to New York?

40:33.257 --> 40:36.333
- No.
- Have Sharona pack your bags.

40:36.368 --> 40:40.368
That's where you'll find the man
you're looking for.

40:40.715 --> 40:42.379
His name...

40:43.201 --> 40:46.757
is Warrick Tennyson.

40:48.165 --> 40:52.498
Did... Did he kill her?

40:52.533 --> 40:56.148
He was involved.

40:56.701 --> 40:59.297
That's all I have.

40:59.332 --> 41:05.342
- How do you know all this?
- Oh, sweetheart, I am Dale the Whale!

41:05.377 --> 41:07.094
You'd better not be lying to him.

41:07.129 --> 41:11.048
It's the truth, as God is my witness.

41:11.083 --> 41:13.305
He is your witness,

41:13.340 --> 41:15.963
and so am I.

41:18.357 --> 41:23.735
Well, I guess we're going to New York.

41:38.499 --> 41:41.411
Well, congratulations, Monk.
You solved the case.

41:41.446 --> 41:44.289
- It's all over the radio.
- Oh, man.

41:44.324 --> 41:45.252
What are you doing?

41:45.287 --> 41:49.901
Oh, the sky, the grass.
I forgot how beautiful they were.

41:49.936 --> 41:52.216
Monk, you were only in there
for a day and a half.

41:52.251 --> 41:58.477
Yeah, Randy, I did my bit,
and I did it standing up.

41:58.669 --> 42:01.272
I'm gonna tell you people something.

42:01.946 --> 42:04.514
Prison changes a man.

42:05.261 --> 42:06.856
Don't you wish?

42:26.193 --> 42:30.359
Bon voyage, Mr. Monk.
