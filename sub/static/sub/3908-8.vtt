That little place
in the rock

01:52.349 --> 01:54.482
in the trees.

01:55.769 --> 01:57.902
A cave

01:57.904 --> 01:59.738
is how I remember it.

02:01.158 --> 02:03.241
It's like a fairy tale.

02:07.781 --> 02:09.330
Four days?

02:10.917 --> 02:13.668
No, maybe he gave me
something.

02:14.921 --> 02:17.372
Maybe I blocked it out.

02:20.377 --> 02:23.011
It's a black hole.

02:23.013 --> 02:24.679
This empty space,

02:24.681 --> 02:27.599
<i>those four days.</i>

02:27.601 --> 02:30.051
And what I remember
when I got...

02:35.692 --> 02:37.776
I got in the car.

02:46.369 --> 02:48.403
He didn't force me.

02:49.456 --> 02:52.073
<i>He didn't even get</i>
<i>near me.</i>

02:54.294 --> 02:56.294
He called me pretty.

03:02.753 --> 03:04.919
<i>I remember.</i>

03:07.724 --> 03:10.341
I remember
it made me feel...

03:11.595 --> 03:13.561
I liked...

03:20.654 --> 03:24.572
<i>I got in the van</i>
<i>with a stranger.</i>

03:27.494 --> 03:31.112
<i>Every time I remember</i>

03:31.114 --> 03:33.448
<i>that feeling,</i>

03:33.450 --> 03:36.167
<i>like pride,</i>

03:36.169 --> 03:39.454
<i>I get sick to my stomach.</i>

03:39.456 --> 03:41.673
<i>I could lie to myself,</i>

03:41.675 --> 03:44.425
but I felt proud.

03:44.427 --> 03:47.846
I was proud
that he thought

03:47.848 --> 03:50.431
I was pretty.

04:00.894 --> 04:02.977
Makes me sick.

04:05.398 --> 04:07.699
None of that
was your fault.

04:44.821 --> 04:47.071
Ray:
<i>I walk up behind him.</i>

04:48.191 --> 04:50.825
It's him.
It's the guy.

04:50.827 --> 04:52.694
I've been thinking
about him.

04:52.696 --> 04:56.030
<i>I've been picturing him</i>
<i>for months.</i>

04:56.032 --> 04:59.167
<i>I'm not sleeping.</i>

04:59.169 --> 05:01.669
<i>Passing strangers</i>
<i>who was wondering.</i>

05:02.756 --> 05:05.123
He turned his head

05:05.125 --> 05:07.175
right as I was
up on him.

05:09.429 --> 05:11.796
<i>I planned to say it...</i>

05:13.099 --> 05:15.383
but I didn't say anything.

05:15.385 --> 05:18.052
I got sick,
and to keep from being sick,

05:18.054 --> 05:19.637
I raised up...

05:29.232 --> 05:31.199
right when
he was turning.

05:36.907 --> 05:38.656
And I...

05:44.581 --> 05:46.998
<i>It didn't make</i>
<i>anything better.</i>

05:48.835 --> 05:50.585
<i>It made it worse.</i>

05:53.006 --> 05:55.723
<i>And I know now,</i>

05:55.725 --> 05:57.425
you know, the act,

05:57.427 --> 06:02.597
it described
a trajectory.

06:04.401 --> 06:05.767
People...

06:08.521 --> 06:10.355
whole cultures

06:10.357 --> 06:12.607
<i>wouldn't blame you.</i>

06:14.244 --> 06:15.994
I don't.

06:23.036 --> 06:25.119
It wasn't him.

06:27.791 --> 06:30.458
They got the real guy.

06:30.460 --> 06:33.261
Something in Venice,
you know?

06:33.263 --> 06:35.296
Weeks ago.

06:42.605 --> 06:44.389
Ani:
<i>Who was he?</i>

06:45.809 --> 06:48.776
I don't even know
if it matters.

07:04.711 --> 07:07.829
So I haven't been
like this in a long time.

07:10.667 --> 07:12.550
Years.

07:13.720 --> 07:15.586
I could tell.

07:17.173 --> 07:19.640
Why?

07:24.014 --> 07:26.481
You seemed like

07:26.483 --> 07:28.983
you were making up
for lost time.

07:40.196 --> 07:42.363
<i>( train whistle blows )</i>

07:42.365 --> 07:44.498
I'd do anything
for 10 more years.

07:44.500 --> 07:46.167
We should have met
when we were young.

07:46.169 --> 07:49.337
We said we wouldn't
regret the past.

07:49.339 --> 07:52.423
Anyway, who said we don't
have 10 more years?

07:54.594 --> 07:56.894
There's 100,000 there.

07:56.896 --> 07:58.979
You're gonna go
with Nails.

07:58.981 --> 08:01.182
I'll meet you
in two weeks or less.

08:01.184 --> 08:04.018
Like hell.
I'm not leaving you.

08:04.020 --> 08:07.822
I know about the clubs.
I saw Blake.

08:07.824 --> 08:10.358
- I'm not--
- You don't have a choice.

08:10.360 --> 08:13.244
I always have a choice.

08:14.864 --> 08:17.081
And I'm not
going anywhere.

08:21.454 --> 08:24.839
It's not gonna work,
the you and me thing.

08:26.426 --> 08:28.876
The way I see it is you
weren't up front with me.

08:28.878 --> 08:31.712
If you can't have a kid, then
what good is the design, see?

08:31.714 --> 08:33.847
You had me on
the fairy tale for a while,

08:33.850 --> 08:36.217
and it was good,

08:36.219 --> 08:37.768
but now it's time to go.

08:37.770 --> 08:40.438
You can't act for shit.

08:40.440 --> 08:42.606
Take it from me.

08:42.607 --> 08:44.892
Where one goes, the other goes.
That's what we said.

08:44.894 --> 08:48.979
That's not acting. Now take your
payout and get the fuck on.

08:57.206 --> 09:00.708
Your ring?
What is that?

09:00.710 --> 09:03.127
You think that I--
here.

09:04.247 --> 09:06.997
You think I give
a fuck about rings?

09:08.968 --> 09:11.001
- That was a big diamond.
- Fuck you.

09:11.003 --> 09:14.088
I am not leaving you. I know
what you're doing, Frank.

09:14.090 --> 09:16.807
Stop reading into things.
Listen to what I'm saying.

09:16.809 --> 09:19.143
I am listening
and you're not convincing.

09:19.145 --> 09:20.978
So you listen to me.

09:20.980 --> 09:22.980
Whatever they do to you,
they do to me.

09:22.982 --> 09:25.933
Do you understand?
There's us.

09:25.935 --> 09:29.854
There's us, and everything
else is in the gray.

09:31.240 --> 09:32.606
So fuck your martyrdom.

09:32.608 --> 09:35.609
I came in this with my
eyes open, same as you.

09:45.538 --> 09:47.004
You have to go.

09:47.006 --> 09:50.791
I got us new cars. Nails is
gonna watch out for you.

09:50.793 --> 09:52.960
No.

09:52.962 --> 09:54.962
You come with me.

09:54.964 --> 09:57.465
100,000 is more
than enough.

09:57.467 --> 10:00.468
- To start over?
- To hold on to what's ours.

10:00.470 --> 10:02.269
I can't run.

10:02.271 --> 10:04.939
They'll come for me
and they'll keep coming.

10:04.941 --> 10:06.524
I need to finish this.

10:06.526 --> 10:08.309
You can't finish this.

10:08.311 --> 10:11.312
They made sure of that before
they threw the first punch.

10:11.314 --> 10:14.198
I have a play.
One thing they don't know.

10:14.200 --> 10:16.200
It's not worth it.

10:16.202 --> 10:20.070
I cannot run.
It'll never stop.

10:20.072 --> 10:22.406
If I do that
and I come home

10:22.408 --> 10:25.075
and I find you, no.

10:26.162 --> 10:27.745
No.

10:30.967 --> 10:33.501
I'm not--
I'm not leaving you.

10:34.971 --> 10:39.807
Baby, you made it all
mean something.

10:41.227 --> 10:43.761
Everything before we met.

10:46.098 --> 10:48.849
If they came to me
through you,

10:48.851 --> 10:51.235
if they hurt you,

10:51.237 --> 10:53.654
I couldn't,

10:53.656 --> 10:56.240
I wouldn't
deserve to live.

10:56.242 --> 10:58.692
If you love me,

10:58.694 --> 11:01.328
I cannot do the things
I have to do

11:01.330 --> 11:03.781
unless I know
you're safe.

11:03.783 --> 11:05.866
If I don't think
you're safe,

11:05.868 --> 11:07.535
I'm lost.

11:07.537 --> 11:08.702
They got me.

11:08.704 --> 11:11.372
Nails has two tickets.

11:11.374 --> 11:14.375
Venezuela
out of Oregon.

11:14.377 --> 11:16.460
Not unless you're with me.

11:16.462 --> 11:19.046
Otherwise the last
six years are nothing.

11:19.048 --> 11:21.382
No, they weren't.

11:21.384 --> 11:23.467
Never nothing.

11:23.469 --> 11:25.886
I know.

11:25.888 --> 11:29.273
I know. That was
never our story.

11:31.894 --> 11:33.694
I got my ticket out.

11:33.696 --> 11:36.780
I'll meet you inside of
two weeks, I promise.

11:41.370 --> 11:43.404
Two weeks.

11:43.406 --> 11:45.406
Or less.

11:45.408 --> 11:46.624
Barquisimeto.

11:46.626 --> 11:49.460
You'll meet me
in two weeks

11:49.462 --> 11:51.579
or less.

11:51.581 --> 11:53.964
El Obelisco.

11:53.966 --> 11:55.549
There's a park there.

11:57.837 --> 11:59.920
Wear a white dress.

12:02.758 --> 12:06.477
You wear a white suit with
a red rose in your jacket.

12:07.763 --> 12:10.598
I'll wear a red rose
in my jacket.

12:13.019 --> 12:15.235
I'll see you coming
out of the crowd,

12:15.237 --> 12:17.605
a head higher
than everybody else.

12:19.241 --> 12:21.825
At first I'm worried.

12:21.827 --> 12:23.611
I can't see you.

12:26.616 --> 12:28.499
But then you do.

12:28.501 --> 12:30.000
( chuckles )

12:30.002 --> 12:31.585
I see the white dress.

12:44.016 --> 12:45.849
You don't have
to do that, Frank.

12:45.851 --> 12:47.801
I mean the money.

12:47.803 --> 12:49.720
Couldn't see.

12:49.722 --> 12:51.138
Blood in my eyes.

12:51.140 --> 12:53.857
Nail in my fucking head.

12:53.859 --> 12:55.693
I heard him saying
leave me.

12:55.695 --> 12:58.228
Fucking teamster.
A nail gun.

12:58.230 --> 13:01.815
Slung me over your shoulder.
I don't forget that.

13:01.817 --> 13:04.068
I know you don't.

13:07.456 --> 13:09.823
Nobody's gonna
get near her.

13:09.825 --> 13:11.792
I promise.

13:11.794 --> 13:13.494
We'll see you
in two weeks.

13:13.496 --> 13:14.745
Or less.

13:26.559 --> 13:28.008
( mouths words ) _

13:29.061 --> 13:31.145
<i>( engine starts )</i>

13:49.532 --> 13:53.500
Man: <i>The security camera
right down the street.</i>

13:53.502 --> 13:55.035
Burris:
<i>Yeah, he, uh--</i>

13:55.037 --> 13:58.038
he worked under the prosecutor
for the AG that got murdered.

13:58.040 --> 14:00.874
- ( phone buzzing )
- Excuse me.

14:03.045 --> 14:04.461
Burris: <i> - Yeah?</i>
- Woodrugh?

14:04.463 --> 14:06.930
He's no longer with us,
I'm afraid.

14:06.932 --> 14:09.183
<i>Hello, Ray.</i>

14:11.220 --> 14:14.388
Ray: - What happened?
- <i> Why don't you tell me, Ray?</i>

14:14.390 --> 14:18.192
Hmm?
Davis, Woodrugh.

14:18.194 --> 14:19.727
It's all you, right?

14:21.313 --> 14:23.397
You know I know, right?

14:23.399 --> 14:25.783
<i>The robbery in '92.</i>

14:25.785 --> 14:27.985
<i>Caspere kept</i>
<i>some diamonds.</i>

14:27.987 --> 14:30.788
He was holding them
over you, yeah?

14:32.124 --> 14:35.492
We should meet.
Let's talk this over.

14:35.494 --> 14:37.628
You could come out
of this good, Ray.

14:38.798 --> 14:40.748
I can make it go away.

14:40.750 --> 14:44.468
Put you right.
Get you paid.

14:44.470 --> 14:46.720
Sure.

14:46.722 --> 14:50.841
Yeah, I'll drop by
PD later today.

14:53.095 --> 14:54.344
Where are you?

14:54.346 --> 14:57.014
Come on, Ray.
You're one of us.

14:58.434 --> 15:01.101
Why Woodrugh?
There was no reason.

15:01.103 --> 15:04.571
Why do you care? You know
the guy was a fag, right?

15:04.573 --> 15:06.190
<i>Come on,</i>
<i>you're a player, Ray.</i>

15:06.192 --> 15:08.108
<i>Let's talk.</i>
<i>We can work this out.</i>

15:08.110 --> 15:09.777
Yeah, sure thing,
Lieutenant.

15:12.782 --> 15:15.032
What was that?

15:16.452 --> 15:18.418
Woodrugh.

15:20.172 --> 15:21.672
He's dead.

15:25.561 --> 15:26.977
<i>( crying )</i>

15:31.317 --> 15:33.434
Who?

15:33.436 --> 15:35.352
Why? What--

15:35.354 --> 15:39.156
Jesus Christ. He was gonna
have a fucking kid.

15:39.158 --> 15:41.358
It was Burris.

15:41.360 --> 15:43.777
<i>They're putting it</i>
<i>on me.</i>

15:43.779 --> 15:45.696
First Davis, now--
fuck!

15:45.698 --> 15:48.115
I can't-- I can't--

15:48.117 --> 15:50.250
Jesus, he was--

15:52.672 --> 15:54.705
after everything else.

15:56.008 --> 15:58.926
( groans )
Fuck.

16:07.770 --> 16:09.970
He was better than us.

16:12.808 --> 16:15.359
He saved our asses.

16:16.362 --> 16:18.145
Twice.

16:19.815 --> 16:21.482
Three times.

16:22.902 --> 16:24.735
Now.

16:30.242 --> 16:31.992
He deserved better.

16:37.133 --> 16:39.466
Who do we have now?

16:40.670 --> 16:43.587
The girl Erica,
she's in the wind.

16:50.312 --> 16:51.762
There was two of them.

16:51.764 --> 16:54.815
- The kids-- boy, girl.
- What?

16:54.817 --> 16:57.017
Field interviews,
that movie set.

16:57.019 --> 17:00.404
We had a crew list. There was a guy there.
Set photographer.

17:00.406 --> 17:03.190
She talked to him.
The ages are right.

17:03.192 --> 17:05.742
Fuck, they even
kind of looked alike.

17:05.744 --> 17:08.529
Set photographer.
Lenny Tyler.

17:08.531 --> 17:11.330
That's the brother.
Laura and Leonard.

17:11.333 --> 17:13.450
They might have
the hard drive.

17:13.452 --> 17:14.917
Caspere's hidden camera.

17:14.920 --> 17:17.538
Caspere's murder,
if it was them,

17:17.540 --> 17:19.540
it just opened up
all this other stuff.

17:19.541 --> 17:22.291
We were always set up.

17:22.294 --> 17:23.594
So was Frank.

17:23.596 --> 17:24.762
Your gangster buddy.

17:24.763 --> 17:26.213
Yeah, he's actually
not a bad guy,

17:26.214 --> 17:29.183
but, yeah,
Caspere was playing him.

17:29.185 --> 17:31.885
So we find Osterman.
Tyler.

17:31.887 --> 17:34.221
Says here Lenny's
with the union.

17:34.223 --> 17:36.190
They'd have
some kind of address.

17:42.782 --> 17:44.732
Unless you just want
to take off.

17:47.119 --> 17:50.037
I'm pretty sure

17:50.039 --> 17:52.239
I can get us
out of the country.

17:54.293 --> 17:57.911
If there's a chance to get
them, I want to take it.

18:02.334 --> 18:05.252
I was never big
on running myself.

18:07.840 --> 18:09.757
Woodrugh wasn't.

18:48.514 --> 18:50.764
( whistles )

18:54.220 --> 18:56.270
Hello.

19:11.821 --> 19:13.453
Veronica:
<i>Austin?</i>

19:15.324 --> 19:17.491
<i>Tony?</i>

19:19.295 --> 19:21.745
Where is he?
Tony.

19:21.747 --> 19:24.748
I don't know.

19:24.750 --> 19:26.667
What-- what day is it?

19:28.304 --> 19:31.138
- There was yelling.
- Yelling about what?

19:31.140 --> 19:35.008
A Russian man.
Tony's parties.

19:35.010 --> 19:37.344
His new business
or something.

19:37.346 --> 19:38.645
Hard to remember.

19:38.647 --> 19:40.764
How did you meet
Austin the mayor?

19:40.766 --> 19:43.400
Tony introduced us.

19:43.402 --> 19:46.820
He say his father lonely
since mother got sick.

19:48.858 --> 19:50.858
But you were
Tony's friend first?

19:56.532 --> 19:58.949
( screams )

20:00.419 --> 20:01.752
Shh, shh.

20:01.754 --> 20:04.037
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

20:08.093 --> 20:09.877
How did this--

20:09.879 --> 20:12.546
I-- I don't--
he kill himself?

20:12.548 --> 20:14.181
Where's the daughter Betty?

20:14.183 --> 20:17.718
Betty?
She was there, I think.

20:17.720 --> 20:19.469
With the yelling.

20:19.471 --> 20:21.188
They talk about me.
I hear them.

20:21.190 --> 20:23.807
She's sick
like her mother.

20:23.809 --> 20:26.693
I can't believe
Austin would do this.

20:26.695 --> 20:29.146
Are you fucking dense?

20:29.148 --> 20:31.231
This is your boy Tony.

20:31.233 --> 20:33.400
Made it look like
some half-ass suicide.

20:33.402 --> 20:36.653
And my guess is you'll
be taking the fall.

20:36.655 --> 20:39.122
Where's Tony now?
Think.

20:39.124 --> 20:40.407
Where would he be?

20:40.409 --> 20:42.993
I-- I don't know.
He's cold to me now.

20:44.997 --> 20:46.747
Is there a safe
in the house?

20:46.749 --> 20:48.632
Do you have access
to bank accounts?

20:48.634 --> 20:50.167
Austin handles
those things.

20:50.169 --> 20:52.502
I have allowance.

20:52.504 --> 20:55.222
Then I hope you saved some
of that Miss Ukraine money.

22:46.001 --> 22:48.035
Erica:
<i>Len?</i>

22:56.595 --> 22:58.261
<i>Len?</i>

23:08.390 --> 23:10.357
You?

23:20.569 --> 23:23.537
Erica:
<i>They split us up after.</i>

23:23.539 --> 23:25.489
<i>I had a foster family,</i>

23:25.491 --> 23:27.741
but Len went
into a group home.

23:29.128 --> 23:32.579
I ran away at 16.

23:32.581 --> 23:34.498
Started working
the streets.

23:34.500 --> 23:36.967
How did you meet
Caspere?

23:36.969 --> 23:39.469
Through Tascha.

23:39.471 --> 23:41.755
She introduced
me to Tony.

23:41.757 --> 23:44.174
Brought me
into the parties.

23:44.176 --> 23:47.094
Then she told me
about his diamonds.

23:48.931 --> 23:50.931
Then I met him...

23:52.568 --> 23:54.434
and I knew.

23:54.436 --> 23:57.237
He used to visit
my mother.

23:58.357 --> 24:00.273
I remembered him.

24:02.277 --> 24:05.112
And you got him
to hire you?

24:05.114 --> 24:07.664
I changed my name.

24:07.666 --> 24:09.583
Dyed my hair red.

24:09.585 --> 24:12.119
He didn't recognize me
from the parties.

24:12.121 --> 24:15.372
I started digging
into all of his stuff.

24:15.374 --> 24:18.008
And Len,
your brother?

24:18.010 --> 24:21.178
We found each other
years back.

24:23.632 --> 24:25.966
He'd been through a lot.

24:25.968 --> 24:29.102
The places he grew up.

24:30.389 --> 24:32.472
I got him a job
on the movie set.

24:33.642 --> 24:37.277
And what happened
with Caspere exactly?

24:37.279 --> 24:39.229
I went to his place.

24:39.231 --> 24:42.449
His other place. I left
the door unlocked.

24:42.451 --> 24:44.234
Put a pill in his drink.

24:44.236 --> 24:47.954
Len came in. He saw
inside the house.

24:49.992 --> 24:52.492
He knew what
I'd been doing.

24:52.494 --> 24:55.795
He went bad.

24:55.797 --> 24:59.499
He was gonna use the
acid to get Ben to talk,

24:59.501 --> 25:01.384
to tell us who else
had robbed us,

25:01.386 --> 25:05.255
who had killed our parents,
but he got carried away.

25:05.257 --> 25:07.474
He was too angry.

25:09.011 --> 25:11.311
He put him
out there on the road.

25:11.313 --> 25:13.346
- Why?
- I don't know.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.566
I think...

25:18.437 --> 25:20.353
he thought it was funny.

25:20.355 --> 25:23.073
Caspere was confessing
everything.

25:23.075 --> 25:25.108
Begging.
( sniffles )

25:25.110 --> 25:28.495
<i>He told him about</i>
<i>the rail corridor.</i>

25:28.497 --> 25:32.365
<i>He drove around with Ben's
body through all those places.</i>

25:32.367 --> 25:35.202
Why'd he leave you
like this?

25:36.955 --> 25:39.506
Because I was trying
to stop them.

25:39.508 --> 25:41.041
From what?

25:41.043 --> 25:44.044
He's gonna meet up with
that chief, Holloway.

25:44.046 --> 25:45.845
He's gonna trade him
the hard drive

25:45.847 --> 25:47.631
from Ben's place
for the diamonds.

25:47.633 --> 25:48.715
What's on the hard drive?

25:48.717 --> 25:51.885
Would have been footage
of important men.

25:51.887 --> 25:55.388
- You said would have.
- We didn't have the password.

25:56.558 --> 25:58.308
And the hard drive
erased itself.

25:58.310 --> 26:00.944
Some kind of
security feature.

26:00.946 --> 26:04.231
- It's blank.
- He's going there to kill Holloway.

26:05.867 --> 26:07.484
Where's he meeting
Holloway?

26:07.486 --> 26:09.069
How long ago
did he leave?

26:09.071 --> 26:11.738
A couple of hours. He
wanted to get there early.

26:11.740 --> 26:13.823
- Where?
- The train station here.

26:13.825 --> 26:16.910
The big new one.
He wanted a public place.

26:16.912 --> 26:20.413
We got her testimony. You stay with her
until we can walk her into a precinct.

26:20.415 --> 26:22.132
Ray. Ray, wait.

26:37.349 --> 26:40.684
Saw the mayor went for a swim.
Thought I should say good-bye.

26:40.686 --> 26:44.487
Osip: <i>What are you doing, Frank?
This was very unlike you.</i>

26:44.489 --> 26:48.775
Lashing out, childish.
Now I have to answer.

26:48.777 --> 26:51.778
Like I had to answer this,
you patronizing old fuck?

26:51.780 --> 26:54.497
Are you still
in LA, Frank?

26:54.499 --> 26:58.118
Oh, I'm long gone,
cue ball.

26:58.120 --> 26:59.536
But we'll settle up later.

26:59.538 --> 27:01.621
We certainly will.

27:01.623 --> 27:05.125
Good luck with that,
you KGB kike motherfucker.

27:05.127 --> 27:07.460
I'll only need
the one bullet.

27:07.462 --> 27:09.796
Maybe not today
and maybe not tomorrow,

27:09.798 --> 27:12.215
but, Osip,
when the lights go out,

27:12.217 --> 27:14.434
that's me.

27:14.436 --> 27:16.019
<i>( beeps )</i>

27:20.309 --> 27:23.193
<i>( phone rings )</i>

27:23.195 --> 27:25.362
- <i> ( beeps )</i>
- Who is this?

27:25.364 --> 27:28.982
- <i> Velcoro.</i>
- Ray.

27:28.984 --> 27:31.484
I was just
thinking about you.

27:36.792 --> 27:38.458
Where are you
taking me?

27:38.460 --> 27:40.043
Me? Nowhere.

27:40.045 --> 27:42.162
This bus goes
to Seattle.

27:42.164 --> 27:44.497
Hits a couple stops
in between.

27:44.499 --> 27:48.335
You get out of here.
Forget this.

27:48.337 --> 27:49.803
Maybe it can
blow over for you.

27:49.805 --> 27:53.139
This is never
gonna blow over.

27:53.141 --> 27:55.008
My life ended that day.

27:55.010 --> 27:57.227
Except it didn't.

27:57.229 --> 28:00.597
You can lay it down.
I'm giving you that.

28:01.983 --> 28:03.600
Why?

28:04.569 --> 28:07.737
Because...

28:07.739 --> 28:09.272
whatever debt there was,

28:09.274 --> 28:12.525
you're not the person who
needs to be punished now.

28:12.527 --> 28:14.277
What about Len?

28:17.866 --> 28:19.366
Lay him to rest.

28:19.368 --> 28:21.584
Sounds like you
lost him years ago.

28:25.374 --> 28:26.956
What am I supposed to do?

28:29.845 --> 28:31.878
I don't know.

29:07.082 --> 29:08.965
Nobody is here right now.

29:08.967 --> 29:11.167
I just move
a group through.

29:11.169 --> 29:14.587
Anybody come around
asking about me?

29:14.589 --> 29:16.389
No.

29:23.014 --> 29:24.981
What are you doing, Frank?

29:24.983 --> 29:26.182
Taking off soon.

29:26.184 --> 29:29.018
And I'm signing
the place over to you.

29:29.020 --> 29:31.020
All the way.

29:31.022 --> 29:33.106
It's yours.

29:33.108 --> 29:34.774
Thank you.

29:34.776 --> 29:37.327
I was always grateful
for your help.

29:41.416 --> 29:44.167
You heard about Ray?

29:45.337 --> 29:47.170
It's a frame-up.

29:47.172 --> 29:49.622
He'll be back here,
everything goes all right.

29:49.624 --> 29:51.541
They're gonna need
transport to Mexico.

29:52.711 --> 29:54.711
They?

29:54.713 --> 29:56.796
Him and a woman.

29:58.183 --> 30:00.717
What is going on? I heard
about the poker room.

30:00.719 --> 30:03.686
Everything's ending.

30:03.688 --> 30:05.305
Time to wake up.

Don't turn around or I'll cut you in
half before the show even starts.

32:09.514 --> 32:11.731
Just listen closely.

32:11.733 --> 32:13.316
You're fucking
this up, kid.

32:13.318 --> 32:15.101
Who are you?

32:15.103 --> 32:17.437
The guy you blasted
with a fucking shotgun

32:17.439 --> 32:18.988
in your little bird mask.

32:18.990 --> 32:21.941
That was Caspere's.
Sick fuck.

32:21.943 --> 32:23.159
Could have killed you.

32:23.161 --> 32:25.278
Well, you don't need to
worry about that right now.

32:27.115 --> 32:29.449
I know what they did.

32:29.451 --> 32:31.701
- Why you're here.
- You know what they did?

32:33.371 --> 32:36.789
To my father?
To me and my sister?

32:38.093 --> 32:40.126
Executed.

32:40.128 --> 32:42.679
Turned my sister
into a whore.

32:42.681 --> 32:45.348
I know everything.

32:45.350 --> 32:46.933
I want them, too.

32:46.935 --> 32:49.469
But suicide ain't
gonna get that.

32:49.471 --> 32:50.937
You want revenge?

32:50.939 --> 32:52.472
Drag their shit out
into the light.

32:52.474 --> 32:54.974
They won't get punished.

32:54.976 --> 32:57.944
I am the blade
and the bullet.

33:02.117 --> 33:04.150
Then listen
carefully to me.

33:41.606 --> 33:43.573
( whistles )

34:12.020 --> 34:14.554
The hard drive
is in this bag.

34:14.556 --> 34:16.938
<i>Lot of interesting</i>
<i>things on there.</i>

34:16.940 --> 34:21.728
A man with this, buy
himself a lot of juice.

34:28.235 --> 34:30.203
What?

34:30.205 --> 34:32.237
What, a wire?

34:32.239 --> 34:33.706
See, I don't need
a wire, Chief.

34:33.708 --> 34:35.291
I got plenty
of insurance.

34:35.293 --> 34:38.377
What I need
is a payout.

34:38.379 --> 34:40.413
The land documents.

34:40.415 --> 34:42.465
They're in the bag, too.

34:43.835 --> 34:46.085
The man who wanted to
meet, he killed Caspere?

34:46.087 --> 34:47.587
Correct.

34:47.589 --> 34:49.672
One of the Osterman kids.

34:49.674 --> 34:51.891
All grown up.

34:51.893 --> 34:53.309
Where is he now?

34:53.311 --> 34:55.928
In a Vinci landfill.

34:57.065 --> 34:59.515
I got copies
of everything.

34:59.517 --> 35:04.020
Something happens
to me on the way out,

35:04.022 --> 35:05.521
that shit hits the cloud.

35:05.523 --> 35:08.241
News agencies.

35:08.243 --> 35:09.609
What do you want?

35:09.611 --> 35:12.111
Any chance
you brought the stones?

35:16.451 --> 35:19.001
Plastic. Had I known
you were coming,

35:19.003 --> 35:22.622
we could have made
different arrangements.

35:22.624 --> 35:25.758
I want out from under.

35:25.760 --> 35:27.927
I want my name cleared.

35:29.097 --> 35:31.714
For the hard drive
and land documents?

35:31.716 --> 35:33.716
Mm-hmm.

35:35.220 --> 35:36.969
And Bezzerides?

35:36.971 --> 35:38.638
Where is she?

35:38.640 --> 35:40.807
Fuck should I know?

35:40.809 --> 35:44.610
She and that Woodrugh guy
both thought I did Davis.

35:44.612 --> 35:47.730
Think I've been working
for you the whole time.

35:47.732 --> 35:50.032
Too bad you weren't.

35:50.034 --> 35:54.487
Honestly, Ray, nobody had an
idea you were this competent.

35:55.874 --> 35:59.208
You all bought your way
into Vinci with the stones.

35:59.210 --> 36:02.328
Caspere made a deal
with Chessani.

36:02.330 --> 36:04.664
Ben had a talent
for dissembling.

36:04.666 --> 36:05.798
And Dixon?

36:05.800 --> 36:07.717
He wasted his part
of the take, yeah?

36:07.719 --> 36:10.169
He was looking to, what, blackmail
you guys for a new piece?

36:10.171 --> 36:11.838
Where is this going, Ray?

36:11.840 --> 36:14.173
Amarilla.
The shoot-out.

36:14.175 --> 36:15.675
How did that happen?

36:15.677 --> 36:18.561
He may have gotten
a tip about the raid.

36:20.265 --> 36:22.932
Closed everything out,
didn't it?

36:24.652 --> 36:27.353
Now you got a piece
of that central corridor.

36:31.025 --> 36:33.693
You know
Chessani's dead, right?

36:33.695 --> 36:35.778
Not the Chessani
I work for.

36:37.115 --> 36:39.866
Cut the shit, Ray.

36:39.868 --> 36:42.702
Whatever happened in '92
isn't the issue.

36:42.704 --> 36:46.005
You want clear,
we put this on Bezzerides.

36:46.007 --> 36:48.257
Geldof is already
on board.

36:53.381 --> 36:55.381
No sudden movements, son.

36:55.383 --> 36:57.934
You're public enemy
number one.

36:57.936 --> 37:00.853
Don't even need a reason
to vaporize you.

37:06.945 --> 37:09.478
Couldn't you have
just taken the stones?

37:09.480 --> 37:11.314
Way back?

37:12.817 --> 37:14.450
Did you have to kill
those people?

37:14.452 --> 37:17.904
The Osterman woman had
been seeing Ben for years.

37:17.906 --> 37:21.073
She was pregnant
and she knew things.

37:21.075 --> 37:22.742
When he tried to break it
off, she threatened him.

37:22.744 --> 37:25.828
Ben didn't even want the first
kid, much less another one.

37:25.830 --> 37:27.630
The first one?

37:27.632 --> 37:29.382
The girl.
The little one.

37:29.384 --> 37:32.001
That was Ben's
illegitimate daughter.

Lady cop.

39:45.553 --> 39:48.804
What gave me away?
The tits?

39:50.691 --> 39:54.310
I meant you're a lady.
You have dignity.

39:57.982 --> 39:59.231
You like Ray?

40:03.287 --> 40:04.737
I like Ray.

40:04.739 --> 40:07.323
Sure that means
a lot to him.

40:07.325 --> 40:10.576
Relationships
are important.

40:10.578 --> 40:12.461
Maybe you disagree.

40:18.836 --> 40:23.255
You take this Venezuela
deal we're talking,

40:23.257 --> 40:25.724
you make it
to Barquisimeto,

40:25.726 --> 40:29.562
there'll be this
lady there in two weeks

40:29.564 --> 40:31.263
at this park.

40:31.265 --> 40:33.599
El Obelisco.

40:33.601 --> 40:35.651
Her name is Jordan.

40:35.653 --> 40:38.187
If she's there
and I'm not,

40:38.189 --> 40:40.406
maybe you can give
her a message.

40:43.744 --> 40:44.994
What's that?

40:51.869 --> 40:54.620
Tell her I wanted
to be there.

40:54.622 --> 40:58.207
And that story we told,
it's still true.

41:30.374 --> 41:32.875
Talk to you a minute?

41:37.465 --> 41:38.831
<i>( faint music playing )</i>

41:38.833 --> 41:41.634
Venezuela works.
Shit extradition.

41:41.636 --> 41:43.385
We could have good lives.

41:43.387 --> 41:46.805
Well, I don't have
much choice at this point.

41:46.807 --> 41:50.092
Anaheim went to shit.

41:50.094 --> 41:52.561
Yeah, but a heist?

41:52.563 --> 41:54.230
You got money to run?

41:54.232 --> 41:57.516
Can't even access a bank.
No credit cards.

41:57.518 --> 41:59.818
Even if retreat
was my inclination,

41:59.820 --> 42:02.188
which it fucking is not,

42:02.190 --> 42:05.407
you want to stay alive,
you and yours,

42:05.409 --> 42:07.826
you need money.

42:20.591 --> 42:23.542
You promised me
the guy who set me up.

42:23.544 --> 42:26.212
It was Blake.

42:26.214 --> 42:29.048
The guy you clipped was some
shit stain had it in for him.

42:29.050 --> 42:32.184
Blake's gone.

42:32.186 --> 42:34.136
He did not go nicely.

42:42.029 --> 42:44.029
Maybe I spared
you that one.

42:47.985 --> 42:50.035

This is just
information, right?

42:59.247 --> 43:00.713
Shit in the air.

43:00.715 --> 43:03.249
That guy they're saying
you killed,

43:03.251 --> 43:04.967
he was your buddy, right?

43:06.587 --> 43:08.254
Actually,

43:08.256 --> 43:11.257
I don't think
I knew him that well.

43:11.259 --> 43:12.925
But...

43:14.345 --> 43:17.763
yeah, yeah,
he was my friend.

43:17.765 --> 43:19.431
Maybe that means
something.

43:19.433 --> 43:21.433
Call it what you want--

43:21.435 --> 43:24.603
revenge, justice,

43:24.605 --> 43:26.739
a retirement package.

43:26.741 --> 43:28.657
Men like this...

43:30.444 --> 43:32.611
they always skate.

43:32.613 --> 43:35.497
Not with me they don't.

43:35.499 --> 43:38.450
I did not live my life
to go out like this.

43:39.370 --> 43:41.120
You?

43:41.122 --> 43:43.172
<i>( music playing faintly )</i>

43:48.796 --> 43:53.382
We use a short cruise,
tourists to Ensenada.

43:53.384 --> 43:56.218
From there, we go south
to San Miguel.

43:56.220 --> 43:58.354
My people are there.
We find someone.

43:58.356 --> 44:00.472
We get you all
to Venezuela.

44:00.474 --> 44:02.274
You've done this a lot?

44:03.477 --> 44:06.612
Much easier to bring
people in than out.

44:06.614 --> 44:09.481
I've been trying to get
Ray to see San Miguel.

44:10.868 --> 44:12.401
How do you know them?

44:14.121 --> 44:17.239
The man that hurt me
years ago,

44:17.241 --> 44:19.658
Ray took care of him.

44:19.660 --> 44:22.328
Put him in prison,
I mean.

44:22.330 --> 44:23.912
Disabled wing.

44:25.082 --> 44:28.417
Frank gave me the money
to buy this place.

44:28.419 --> 44:30.803
Never asked
for it back.

44:37.011 --> 44:39.228
How do you know Ray?

44:44.485 --> 44:49.021
Well, I guess we saved
each other's lives.

44:56.530 --> 45:01.450
Tony and Betty. Pitlor, I
want him on the record.

45:01.452 --> 45:04.370
His files. We can
get confessions.

45:04.372 --> 45:08.006
I've heard enough
confessions today.

45:14.215 --> 45:15.714
Venezuela?

45:18.102 --> 45:19.852
We got nothing
to run on.

45:22.723 --> 45:24.807
And I owe these filth.

45:27.728 --> 45:29.945
I owe Woodrugh.

45:43.744 --> 45:45.577
Would you run?

45:47.631 --> 45:49.965
Now?

45:49.967 --> 45:52.751
If I asked,
would you?

45:52.753 --> 45:54.803
I might.

45:58.225 --> 46:00.259
I just might.

46:52.927 --> 46:54.814

to the waltzing in.

something unfinished.

we get it to the press.

Maybe that "Times" guy
who wrote about Vinci.

52:21.859 --> 52:24.309

52:28.315 --> 52:30.866
Yeah.

You hear me?
You get on that boat.

01:01:37.197 --> 01:01:38.663
I'll catch up.

01:01:38.665 --> 01:01:40.748
Wait. What--

01:01:40.750 --> 01:01:42.784
<i>No, just get here.</i>

01:01:42.786 --> 01:01:44.786
I just wanted--

01:01:47.374 --> 01:01:49.874
I thought we had time.

01:01:49.876 --> 01:01:51.376

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:56.547
I just wanted to see
my boy again.

01:01:56.549 --> 01:01:57.715
What?

01:01:57.717 --> 01:02:00.351
<i>There's a transponder</i>

01:02:02.021 --> 01:02:05.022
Maybe they were watching
from school.

01:02:05.024 --> 01:02:06.808
I don't know.

01:02:06.810 --> 01:02:08.893
Dump it.

01:02:08.895 --> 01:02:10.361
Come on,
get rid of it.

01:02:10.363 --> 01:02:13.114
Put it on a truck headed north.
Come on-- shit, Ray.

01:02:13.116 --> 01:02:14.732
I can't.

01:02:14.734 --> 01:02:17.785
They could have already
been watching, see?

01:02:17.787 --> 01:02:20.238
And if they got
eyes on me,

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:22.156
it won't matter what I do
with the tracker.

01:02:22.158 --> 01:02:23.708
I'd just lead
them to you.

- So what-- what are--
- You just get on the boat.

01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:30.748
Just take the files, take the
recordings and get on that boat.

01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:33.634
<i>Look, I'll ditch the car</i>

01:02:33.636 --> 01:02:35.720

I'll be

01:02:41.010 --> 01:02:43.344

Trust me.

01:02:53.406 --> 01:02:56.190
I can lose these assholes

01:02:57.110 --> 01:02:59.277
Okay.

01:02:59.279 --> 01:03:01.612
Yeah.

01:03:01.614 --> 01:03:04.081
Listen, let me talk
to Felicia.

01:03:04.083 --> 01:03:07.168

Just for a second.

Ani: <i>I'm gonna talk

01:03:09.339 --> 01:03:11.456
We're gonna see
each other again?

01:03:13.343 --> 01:03:15.293
Are you kidding?

01:03:15.295 --> 01:03:17.595
You're gonna need
a restraining order.

01:03:20.767 --> 01:03:23.351
No. No, I won't.

01:03:28.308 --> 01:03:29.807
Okay.

01:03:32.645 --> 01:03:34.946
- Hello.
- I'm not gonna make it.

01:03:36.366 --> 01:03:38.282
<i>Don't ask,</i>

You owe me.

you make sure
she gets out.

01:03:46.376 --> 01:03:48.209
You get her out.

01:03:49.496 --> 01:03:52.046
Okay.

01:03:52.048 --> 01:03:54.131
I promise.

01:03:56.219 --> 01:03:57.835
What did he say?

01:03:59.472 --> 01:04:01.639
To make sure
you get on that boat.

01:04:59.232 --> 01:05:01.983
You? What the fuck is this?

01:05:13.746 --> 01:05:18.082
A turn here, a turn there,
and it goes on for years.

01:05:18.084 --> 01:05:20.384
Becomes something else.

01:05:23.423 --> 01:05:27.008
I'm sorry,
you know,

01:05:27.010 --> 01:05:29.560

01:05:31.097 --> 01:05:33.147
the father I was.

01:05:35.435 --> 01:05:38.069
I hope you got the strength
to learn from that.

01:05:40.857 --> 01:05:44.325
And I hope you got no doubts
how much I loved you, son.

01:05:51.084 --> 01:05:52.917
And you're better
than me.

01:05:54.871 --> 01:05:56.621
If I had been stronger...

01:05:58.791 --> 01:06:01.125
I would have been
more like you.

01:06:04.297 --> 01:06:05.880
Hell, son...

01:06:08.518 --> 01:06:11.302

they'd be more like you.

Frank:
You taking me out?

01:06:36.045 --> 01:06:38.412
I was already gone.

01:06:41.551 --> 01:06:43.501
What the fuck
did you come out to say?

01:06:43.503 --> 01:06:45.469
You made a deal.

01:06:45.471 --> 01:06:47.755
No clubs,
no locations for us.

01:06:47.757 --> 01:06:51.475
The clubs burned down.
What was I supposed to do?

01:06:51.477 --> 01:06:53.644
Armenians, Russians,
this is their thing.

01:06:53.646 --> 01:06:55.763
Where do the Armenians
get their supply,

01:06:55.765 --> 01:06:57.682
what they gave to you?

01:07:00.019 --> 01:07:01.686
You want to get square?

01:07:01.688 --> 01:07:03.821
There's a flat million

01:07:03.823 --> 01:07:05.906

We're square, then,
our business?

01:08:33.830 --> 01:08:36.113
That'll buy you something.

01:08:41.621 --> 01:08:44.205
A million dollars doesn't
buy me a ride back to town?

01:08:46.209 --> 01:08:48.509

Take his suit.

01:08:49.511 --> 01:08:51.545
He wants your suit.

01:08:51.546 --> 01:08:53.046
Give it to him.

01:09:07.563 --> 01:09:10.113
You want my suit?

Hurry. Come on.

01:09:14.319 --> 01:09:15.903
All right.

01:09:17.622 --> 01:09:19.957

01:21:05.664 --> 01:21:07.581
<i>if you know where to look.</i>

01:21:08.666 --> 01:21:11.530
_

01:21:11.537 --> 01:21:14.204
<i>These facts were
paid for in blood...</i>

01:21:16.208 --> 01:21:18.708
<i>so honor that.</i>

01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:21.500
_

01:21:21.513 --> 01:21:24.514
<i>I don't know if it'll</i>
<i>make any difference,</i>

01:21:24.516 --> 01:21:27.217
<i>but it should</i>

01:21:27.219 --> 01:21:29.853
<i>because we deserve</i>
<i>a better world.</i>

01:21:34.226 --> 01:21:36.293
- <i> ( band playing )</i>
- <i> ( fireworks whistling )</i>

01:21:36.295 --> 01:21:38.361
( crowd cheering )

01:21:52.327 --> 01:21:54.794
Ani:
<i>And I owe him that.</i>

01:21:55.747 --> 01:21:57.797
I owe his sons that.

01:21:58.884 --> 01:22:00.333
( sniffles )

01:22:00.335 --> 01:22:02.419
Anyways...

01:22:04.756 --> 01:22:06.423
this is evidence.

01:22:06.425 --> 01:22:09.593
Most of it's here,
some of it's not.

01:22:09.595 --> 01:22:11.561
<i>The truth...</i>

01:22:11.563 --> 01:22:13.897
<i>is naked larceny,</i>

01:22:13.899 --> 01:22:16.349
open murder,

01:22:16.351 --> 01:22:19.069
and cascading betrayals.

01:22:20.439 --> 01:22:22.072
( sniffles )

01:22:26.828 --> 01:22:28.328
Come with me.

01:22:28.330 --> 01:22:30.113
Testify.

01:22:30.115 --> 01:22:32.032
I can bring this
to the "Times."

01:22:32.951 --> 01:22:35.619
It's your story now.

01:22:35.621 --> 01:22:37.203
I told it.

01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:41.174
- But wait, there's--
- Stay here.

01:22:41.176 --> 01:22:44.628
Don't leave this room until
I've been gone for an hour.

01:22:44.630 --> 01:22:46.796
Understand?

01:22:47.716 --> 01:22:48.848
( mouths word )

01:23:00.062 --> 01:23:01.978
( burbling )

01:23:02.898 --> 01:23:04.481
Oh!

01:23:04.483 --> 01:23:05.899
Yeah.

01:23:05.901 --> 01:23:08.652
- ( fussing )
- Oh.

01:23:08.654 --> 01:23:10.320
I know.

01:23:10.322 --> 01:23:12.405
- It's okay.
- <i> ( door opens )</i>

01:23:23.218 --> 01:23:26.219
( baby babbling )

01:23:29.174 --> 01:23:30.557
Hi.

01:23:37.349 --> 01:23:39.149
He's restless.

01:23:40.819 --> 01:23:42.652
Long trip ahead.

01:23:43.689 --> 01:23:46.272
Ready? Okay.

01:23:46.274 --> 01:23:47.741
( baby coos )

01:23:48.827 --> 01:23:51.027
Mm-hmm,
here we go.

01:23:51.029 --> 01:23:52.996
( baby fussing )

01:23:57.369 --> 01:24:00.003
- ( baby babbling )
- You okay?
