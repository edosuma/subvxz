00:07.448 --> 00:09.568
Previously on
"Berlin Station"...

00:13.454 --> 00:14.828
- You want to sit down?
- Do you see that?

00:14.830 --> 00:16.120
- Henrik?
- Halos.

00:16.123 --> 00:17.706
Okay!

00:17.708 --> 00:20.501
Henrik Viiding passed
of cardiac arrest.

00:20.503 --> 00:22.377
The Russians are
already making a move.

00:22.379 --> 00:23.962
Little green men in Estonia.

00:23.964 --> 00:26.423
Spetsnaz. No doubt.

00:26.425 --> 00:29.301
The Russians are already here.

00:29.303 --> 00:32.470
Daniel reported
that he saw a train full of men

00:32.473 --> 00:34.681
on a defunct line, no markings.

00:34.683 --> 00:37.643
<i>No uniforms,
no fingerprints, either.</i>

00:37.645 --> 00:39.645
<i>Tallinn's infested
with Spetsnaz.</i>

00:39.647 --> 00:42.064
You don't really think
someone was trying to
break into your apartment.

00:42.066 --> 00:43.524
Yeah, of course I do.

00:43.526 --> 00:45.025
What, trying to get
the hair sample?

00:45.027 --> 00:48.445
Which I had already dropped off
at the lab.

00:48.447 --> 00:50.656
Um, Maret Yankova?

00:50.658 --> 00:52.157
Did I say that right?

00:52.159 --> 00:53.784
Yes.

00:53.786 --> 00:56.036
Need some quotes for a tribute
piece on Henrik Viiding.

00:56.038 --> 00:58.789
I heard you were
his favorite waitress.

01:09.927 --> 01:11.385
What the hell?!

01:11.387 --> 01:14.429
Rafael Torres.
I'm here to look after you.

01:15.558 --> 01:16.932
I warned them.

01:16.934 --> 01:21.186
Tonight was just
the starting gun.

01:21.188 --> 01:22.604
I got a solid lead.

01:22.606 --> 01:24.064
Some kid who's been
huffing rocket fuel

01:24.066 --> 01:26.108
from the silo complex
showed me a way in.

01:26.110 --> 01:28.110
Give me 12 hours in the dark,

01:28.112 --> 01:29.695
and I'll call you
by 10:00 a.m. SOP.

04:04.852 --> 04:07.769
Next flight out
lays over in Oslo.

04:07.771 --> 04:09.354
You'll be in Berlin soon.

04:09.356 --> 04:10.564
Why would I go to Berlin?

04:10.566 --> 04:11.857
Call "Aaron" when you land.

04:11.859 --> 04:13.734
He's the first number
on your phone.

04:13.736 --> 04:15.569
Someone will meet you there.

04:15.571 --> 04:17.779
Am I still in danger?

04:17.781 --> 04:20.115
Last night,
you said I wasn't the target.

04:20.117 --> 04:21.283
You weren't.

04:21.285 --> 04:23.452
But fake news stirred things up.

04:23.454 --> 04:26.705
They could take you out and just
blame it on an angry citizen.

04:26.707 --> 04:29.875
I'm not the sort
to run and hide.

04:29.877 --> 04:33.336
You're a digital nomad,
aren't you?

04:33.338 --> 04:35.505
You can fight from anywhere.

04:54.234 --> 04:55.650
Kirsch.

04:55.652 --> 04:57.068
<i>Tell me
you've heard from him.</i>

04:57.070 --> 04:58.820
- No, I haven't.
- You're not worried?

04:58.822 --> 05:00.864
Hey, Daniel knows how to
handle himself in the field,

05:00.866 --> 05:02.199
and he told me
he was going dark.

05:02.201 --> 05:03.825
So you haven't
tried to call him?

05:03.827 --> 05:06.203
I picked up the phone
to call him a dozen times,

05:06.205 --> 05:07.746
but it's against
fucking protocol,

05:07.748 --> 05:09.289
so we're just gonna have to
sit and wait.

05:09.291 --> 05:12.709
<i>I'll see you in a minute.</i>

05:22.513 --> 05:24.262
Hey.
How's it going?

05:24.264 --> 05:26.598
Hi.
It's going well.

05:26.600 --> 05:29.768
Um, just trying to get through
to my apartment.

05:29.770 --> 05:32.395
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:32.397 --> 05:35.649
You new to the building?

05:35.651 --> 05:37.025
Yes, I'm new.

05:37.027 --> 05:39.236
Oh, welcome.
I'm Robert.

05:39.238 --> 05:41.154
Hi, Robert.
Nice to meet you.

05:41.156 --> 05:42.239
I'm Nina.

05:42.241 --> 05:43.907
Nice to meet you, too.

05:52.417 --> 05:55.377
Hey, did you get Sofia out?

05:55.379 --> 05:56.878
Valerie wants her as
a counter measure.

05:56.880 --> 05:58.505
She's about to board.

05:58.507 --> 05:59.756
Did you get my sitrep
on the shooting?

05:59.758 --> 06:00.924
Yeah, I got it.

06:00.926 --> 06:02.634
It makes no fucking sense.

06:02.636 --> 06:04.511
Why'd your sniper miss?
<i>- He meant to.</i>

06:04.513 --> 06:06.721
Those rounds hit
exactly where he intended.

06:06.723 --> 06:09.015
Well, that clears it up.
Come on, Torres.

06:09.017 --> 06:11.560
Even after you took Sofia
off the board,

06:11.562 --> 06:13.812
he had tons of targets.

06:13.814 --> 06:15.397
I know this guy.

06:15.399 --> 06:19.025
He uses the new Russian rig,
the ORSIS T-5000.

06:19.027 --> 06:21.319
It's his fucking girlfriend.

06:21.321 --> 06:24.197
From 500 yards,
he can pick which eye.

06:24.199 --> 06:26.283
Centennial crowd was at 550.

06:26.285 --> 06:27.909
<i>This wasn't a kill shot.</i>

06:27.911 --> 06:29.953
<i>This was a starter's gun
to a civil war.</i>

06:29.955 --> 06:31.913
Easy, hotshot.

06:31.915 --> 06:34.082
I'll be the analyst.
You be the action figure.

06:34.084 --> 06:36.710
So you probably don't want to
hear what I thought about

06:36.712 --> 06:39.379
your sitrep on foxglove
and Henrik's death?

06:39.381 --> 06:41.882
He was poisoned.
What of it?

06:41.884 --> 06:46.469
I saw some pretty purple flowers
at the waitress's apartment.

06:46.471 --> 06:48.889
Yeah, made her real nervous
when I saw them.

06:48.891 --> 06:52.183
No.
Shit, I fucking knew it.

06:52.185 --> 06:55.020
She was steeping it in his tea.

06:55.022 --> 06:57.272
Motherfucker.

06:57.274 --> 06:58.607
Wait a minute.

06:58.609 --> 07:00.525
How'd you know
what foxglove looks like?

07:00.527 --> 07:02.652
I got my sources.

07:02.654 --> 07:05.322
Just because I can't
out-fight you

07:05.324 --> 07:07.949
does not mean
I can't out-think you.

07:07.951 --> 07:11.161
Oh, you really are some kind of
an asshole, aren't you?

07:11.163 --> 07:14.122
I'll follow up
with the waitress.

07:14.124 --> 07:16.124
If we can tie her
to Henrik's death,

07:16.126 --> 07:18.126
<i>find out
who she was working for,</i>

07:18.128 --> 07:19.920
<i>Russia's showing her hand.</i>

07:19.922 --> 07:21.254
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

07:21.256 --> 07:23.882
Torres, have you heard
from Daniel?

07:23.884 --> 07:26.134
No.
Why would I?

07:26.136 --> 07:27.886
No, nothing.
Never mind.

07:27.888 --> 07:30.513
Uh, I got to go.
We'll talk later.

07:44.696 --> 07:47.447
Romy, your mother would be
so proud.

07:47.449 --> 07:48.740
Let's try it together.

07:55.248 --> 07:56.748
Nice!

07:56.750 --> 07:59.310
All right, darling.
Come on. Let's go home.

08:00.212 --> 08:01.711
Excuse me.

08:01.713 --> 08:03.922
Let's ask before we rummage
through the fridge.

08:03.924 --> 08:07.300
It's fine, Romy.

08:07.302 --> 08:08.760
- Mom.
- Yes?

08:08.762 --> 08:11.596
Why didn't you tell me
Auntie Val knows ballet?

08:11.598 --> 08:14.224
What doesn't Auntie Val know?

08:14.226 --> 08:17.644
She's been painfully
multi-talented from birth.

08:17.646 --> 08:18.853
Well, that's interesting.

08:18.855 --> 08:20.397
You've only known me
since college.

08:20.399 --> 08:22.232
How do you know I wasn't
a hideously clumsy child?

08:22.234 --> 08:23.692
Because you were not.

08:23.694 --> 08:25.527
No, you're right.
I was fucking adorable.

08:25.529 --> 08:27.904
- Hey.
- Oh, whoops. Shit.

08:27.906 --> 08:29.239
Romy, you didn't hear
any of that.

08:29.241 --> 08:30.991
Come on.

08:30.993 --> 08:33.034
Sorry. I'm not used to
being around kids.

08:33.035 --> 08:34.828
Thank you so much
for letting us stay here.

08:34.830 --> 08:37.288
Of course.
Save your Euros.

08:37.289 --> 08:39.499
You're always welcome here.
You know that.
Thank you.

08:39.501 --> 08:42.126
<i>...demonstrations are already</i>
<i>underway here in Tallinn,</i>

08:42.129 --> 08:44.379
<i>and local authorities
are struggling...</i>

09:03.734 --> 09:05.275
Then they detonated Sama Kaart

09:05.277 --> 09:07.152
and fake newsed it
to blame Sofia,

09:07.154 --> 09:09.988
saying she's trying to fuck
the ethnic Russian population.

09:09.990 --> 09:11.990
And they blamed
the ethnic Russians

09:11.992 --> 09:13.408
for shooting up Centennial.

09:13.410 --> 09:15.994
Look, I know that
they're on the playbook,

09:15.996 --> 09:17.871
but unlike Ukraine,

09:17.873 --> 09:19.497
Estonia is a member of NATO

09:19.499 --> 09:21.750
with a tripwire-force
in-country.

09:21.752 --> 09:25.545
So if civil unrest gives Russia
any reason to invade, they will.

09:25.547 --> 09:27.756
They absolutely will
spill NATO blood,

09:27.758 --> 09:29.174
and that's very risky.

09:29.176 --> 09:31.426
They're already imposing
martial law and curfews,

09:31.428 --> 09:32.844
cranking that burner up to high.

09:32.846 --> 09:35.263
I'm telling you,
civil war may be inevitable

09:35.265 --> 09:37.682
no matter what we...
- Something's wrong.

09:37.684 --> 09:40.185
10:00 a.m., no Daniel.

09:40.187 --> 09:41.519
Maybe he's just running late.

09:41.521 --> 09:43.938
No, he's never late
for a check-in.

09:43.940 --> 09:46.566
I have the last known
coordinates.

09:46.568 --> 09:48.276
He is now officially
out of contact

09:48.278 --> 09:50.987
and he's officially missing,
so...

09:50.989 --> 09:52.697
failsafe in two hours.

09:52.699 --> 09:54.115
We don't have two hours.

09:54.117 --> 09:56.076
Protocol is there for a reason,
Robert.

09:56.078 --> 09:58.286
Operatives go dark in hostile
territory all the time.

09:58.288 --> 10:00.705
You know that.
This isn't just hostile
territory, Valerie.

10:00.707 --> 10:02.749
It's a fucking hybrid war,
I'm telling you.

10:02.751 --> 10:04.542
Trust me, I've seen these guys.

10:04.544 --> 10:07.087
Please, let's take this
to Langley now.

10:07.089 --> 10:08.797
With what exactly?

10:08.799 --> 10:11.049
Because all we have right now
is raw intel.

10:11.051 --> 10:12.592
We need analysis.

10:12.594 --> 10:15.386
There is no room
to misread Russia here.

10:15.388 --> 10:16.763
None at all.

10:16.765 --> 10:18.598
I'm Daniel's handler.

10:18.600 --> 10:21.059
I've been with him,
tracking his mission,

10:21.061 --> 10:23.394
his check-ins,
how he sounds and feels,

10:23.396 --> 10:25.355
and ever since we got off
the phone yesterday,

10:25.357 --> 10:27.732
I've had a voice telling me
that something's wrong.

10:27.734 --> 10:31.194
There. That.
You hear that?

10:31.196 --> 10:33.196
Reasoned intuition, Valerie.

10:33.198 --> 10:36.074
Don't they teach us
to listen to that voice?

10:36.076 --> 10:39.661
Yes, they do.

10:39.663 --> 10:41.704
And I am.

10:41.706 --> 10:42.956
All right, failsafe in one hour.

10:42.958 --> 10:44.624
April, do everything you can.

10:44.626 --> 10:46.709
Look into every option
as far as getting Daniel home.

10:46.711 --> 10:48.419
Got it.
By the way,

10:48.421 --> 10:50.839
Dove and I are going to
his father's lab tonight.

10:50.841 --> 10:52.715
Adeyemi likes me, but, uh,

10:52.717 --> 10:54.384
tonight we'll see
if he trusts me.

10:54.386 --> 10:56.970
Okay, what's going on with Dove?

10:56.972 --> 10:58.638
We were at the cafe
the other day

10:58.640 --> 11:00.348
and there was a guy
that kept staring at us.

11:00.350 --> 11:02.183
Dove said he didn't know
who he was,

11:02.185 --> 11:05.812
but he did seem scared,
and he doesn't scare easy.

11:05.814 --> 11:07.147
Okay, well, we always knew that

11:07.149 --> 11:08.898
there might be other
interested parties.

11:08.900 --> 11:11.025
Do a threat assessment
and just stay on top of it.

11:11.027 --> 11:13.111
Mm.

11:15.282 --> 11:16.573
On the list?

11:16.575 --> 11:18.825
Kirsch. Robert Kirsch,
with a "K."

11:18.827 --> 11:20.326
Robert.

11:20.328 --> 11:21.953
Jesus, you finally made it.

11:21.955 --> 11:24.289
What do you mean finally?
I see you once a week.

11:24.291 --> 11:25.665
How is it, though?
How are you?

11:25.667 --> 11:27.458
How's...
How's Chateau de Steven?

11:27.460 --> 11:29.586
It's haunted.

11:29.588 --> 11:31.171
- What?
- I'm... I'm serious.

11:31.173 --> 11:34.174
It's haunted.
I hear noises, I hear footsteps.

11:35.844 --> 11:37.260
No, no, no, no.

11:37.262 --> 11:39.262
That's for the hoi polloi.
- I'm thirsty.

11:39.264 --> 11:41.973
Come on.
Come on.

11:41.975 --> 11:43.141
German for "frost."

11:43.143 --> 11:44.517
I bought the vineyard next door.

11:44.519 --> 11:46.144
What are you talking about?

11:46.146 --> 11:48.188
Come here, come here.

11:48.190 --> 11:50.899
So this is all you?
Steven, Jesus.

11:50.901 --> 11:53.234
Look, okay.

11:53.236 --> 11:56.154
Germany's second-largest
energy company is about to

11:56.156 --> 11:59.240
offer me a job to vet
one of their Russian partners.

11:59.242 --> 12:01.701
They're gonna put me in charge
of their global portfolio.

12:01.703 --> 12:02.911
Goddamn.

12:02.913 --> 12:04.579
Yeah.

12:04.581 --> 12:08.082
Six months ago, you fucking
despised the private sector.

12:08.084 --> 12:10.960
I had to find my place,
and now I got "fuck you" money.

12:10.962 --> 12:13.129
And believe me, there's a lot
more where that came from.

12:13.131 --> 12:14.464
Oh, here comes the sales pitch.

12:14.466 --> 12:16.382
No, listen.
My... My...

12:16.384 --> 12:18.676
- No.
- My offer is still on the ta...

12:18.678 --> 12:19.677
- Come on.
- No.

12:19.679 --> 12:20.929
Robert, join me.

12:20.931 --> 12:22.222
Let's get the band
back together.

12:22.224 --> 12:23.973
You know the best part?

12:23.975 --> 12:25.558
You don't have to run anything
up a flagpole either.

12:25.560 --> 12:28.269
I don't have to beg for
resources or kowtow to D.C.

12:28.271 --> 12:30.980
My intel gets things done.

12:30.982 --> 12:33.942
Well, I could get used to that.

12:33.944 --> 12:36.402
Times have changed.

12:36.404 --> 12:38.738
It's not about nations anymore.

12:38.740 --> 12:40.949
So, what's your take on Estonia?

12:40.951 --> 12:42.450
Why ask me?

12:42.452 --> 12:44.285
I heard you and Daniel
were just there.

12:44.287 --> 12:45.370
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

12:45.372 --> 12:47.038
Who the fuck told you that?

12:47.040 --> 12:48.122
How come you didn't
bring him with you?

12:48.124 --> 12:49.290
I thought you might.

12:49.292 --> 12:51.125
No, he's still there.

12:51.127 --> 12:53.086
He's dealing with something.

12:53.088 --> 12:55.296
Okay, Estonia.

12:55.298 --> 12:57.423
That's the Kremlin's
favorite dog whistle.

12:57.425 --> 12:59.342
How so?

12:59.344 --> 13:02.262
Economy's flat,
sanctions are hurting,

13:02.264 --> 13:03.972
natives are restless,
so what better time?

13:03.974 --> 13:06.182
Let's resurrect
the Soviet Empire.

13:06.184 --> 13:09.060
So, Kremlin stirs the pot
in Estonia.

13:09.062 --> 13:11.604
The West does its usual
headless chicken thing

13:11.606 --> 13:13.523
with chest thumping
and empty threats

13:13.525 --> 13:17.110
and uniting the Russian people
against the evil foreigner.

13:17.112 --> 13:18.861
And in the meantime,

13:18.863 --> 13:20.780
the oligarchs
buy out the government

13:20.782 --> 13:22.240
and they rape the economy.

13:22.242 --> 13:23.616
It's Russia.

13:23.618 --> 13:27.120
It's, uh, it's run by
a career KGB officer

13:27.122 --> 13:30.081
whose motto is "deny, distract,
and counterattack."

13:30.083 --> 13:32.166
I mean, there's always
a deeper game here.

13:32.168 --> 13:33.710
What about SUPO?
- Mm.

13:33.712 --> 13:35.211
- Huh?
- Mnh-mnh.

13:35.213 --> 13:37.088
The Finns know the Russians
best. What do they say?

13:37.090 --> 13:40.091
No, we're not exactly high on
their Christmas list this year.

13:40.093 --> 13:42.218
Oh.
I can't get
a fucking call returned.

13:42.220 --> 13:44.554
I'll return your calls.

13:44.556 --> 13:45.972
- Oh.
- I will.

13:45.974 --> 13:47.849
God.
Especially
if we're in the same office.

13:47.851 --> 13:49.517
I'll always return your calls.

13:49.519 --> 13:51.644
No.

13:51.646 --> 13:53.521
Final answer.

13:53.523 --> 13:55.773
We're currently
combing through intel.

13:55.775 --> 13:57.275
Robert just got back yesterday.

13:57.277 --> 13:59.485
We still have an operative
in the field.

13:59.487 --> 14:01.112
Thanks for the update.

14:01.114 --> 14:03.614
I can't say you provided any
particular insight

14:03.616 --> 14:06.826
beyond a series
of unfortunate events

14:06.828 --> 14:08.745
which may or may not
involve Russia.

14:08.747 --> 14:11.205
Oh, I-I-I understand that,
Jason.

14:11.207 --> 14:12.623
But everything's moving
very quickly,

14:12.625 --> 14:14.167
so I really just wanted to
keep you up to speed.

14:14.169 --> 14:17.045
<i>I have something else for you,
Valerie.</i>

14:17.047 --> 14:19.005
<i>Unless Estonia's
all you can handle.</i>

14:19.007 --> 14:20.840
No, please.

14:20.842 --> 14:24.135
What do you know
about Gilbert Dorn?

14:24.137 --> 14:26.179
Gilbert Dorn?

14:26.181 --> 14:29.057
Um, same as everyone.

14:29.059 --> 14:31.476
Legend put out to pasture.

14:31.478 --> 14:33.353
Saw and did it all
during the Cold War.

14:33.355 --> 14:36.272
<i>Cast a pretty long shadow
at Berlin Station.</i>

14:36.274 --> 14:38.441
He never left.
Retired in Berlin.

14:38.443 --> 14:40.777
Did not know that.

14:40.779 --> 14:43.488
Let me guess,
he's writing a book.

14:43.490 --> 14:45.656
Worse... podcast.

14:45.658 --> 14:47.325
<i>Been at it a few months.</i>

14:47.327 --> 14:50.036
<i>Last week, he went on about</i>

14:50.038 --> 14:53.081
<i>a real story about
the fall of the wall.</i>

14:53.083 --> 14:55.208
Fiction, of course.

14:55.210 --> 14:58.086
<i>Really. He's embarrassing
himself more than anyone.</i>

14:58.088 --> 15:00.004
<i>He's been drinking.</i>

15:00.006 --> 15:02.799
And the Agency is concerned
for his welfare, got it.

15:02.801 --> 15:04.926
Um, wouldn't it just be cleaner

15:04.928 --> 15:07.303
to give this to
a company lawyer?

15:07.305 --> 15:10.139
<i>We're way beyond lawyers.</i>

15:10.141 --> 15:12.100
<i>But I've been told
40 years merits</i>

15:12.102 --> 15:13.893
<i>at least a courtesy call.</i>

15:13.895 --> 15:17.230
I will be sure to
deliver that message.

15:17.232 --> 15:18.856
Thank you, Jason.

15:24.447 --> 15:27.990
Ladies and gentlemen,
Joshua Russell's "The Spear"...

15:27.992 --> 15:31.744
A master work previously part of
the collection of King George V,

15:31.746 --> 15:35.748
and I'm going to start the
bidding here at 480,000 Euros.

15:35.750 --> 15:37.708
That's 480,000 Euros.

15:37.710 --> 15:38.835
480,000.

15:38.837 --> 15:40.503
490,000 Euros.

15:40.505 --> 15:42.380
490,000.

15:42.382 --> 15:44.465
500,000 Euros.

15:44.467 --> 15:48.010
Well, this beats a brush pass
in a dark alley.

15:48.012 --> 15:50.179
Thought you wouldn't mind
meeting here.

15:50.181 --> 15:51.722
Someone's passing off fakes?

15:51.724 --> 15:54.600
Or international
money laundering.

15:54.602 --> 15:56.853
Those of you following online...

15:56.855 --> 15:59.689
You know, we have a lot of
these transactions

15:59.691 --> 16:01.274
flowing through
the U.S. bank system,

16:01.276 --> 16:03.568
so if you ever need my help...

16:03.570 --> 16:05.319
Thank you.

16:05.321 --> 16:07.864
In exchange for what?

16:07.866 --> 16:09.949
Have you been following Estonia?

16:09.951 --> 16:12.952
We are aware of the situation,
yes.

16:12.954 --> 16:15.538
Would you agree
that it's serious?

16:15.540 --> 16:19.083
The level of seriousness
depends on the level of proof.

16:19.085 --> 16:22.545
The unrest is growing and
of course Russia is involved.

16:22.547 --> 16:24.714
I know for America,
this is all new and exciting,

16:24.716 --> 16:27.258
but in Europe,
we're more used to it.

16:27.260 --> 16:29.927
From what I've seen,
it's Article 5 serious.

16:29.929 --> 16:33.347
An attack on Estonia
is an attack on America?

16:33.349 --> 16:36.893
Are you speaking on behalf of
the United States government?

16:36.895 --> 16:40.605
I realize that our policies have
been unpredictable at times.

16:40.607 --> 16:44.317
More like <i> backpfeifengesicht...</i>

16:44.319 --> 16:45.860
"A face in need of
a good punch."

16:45.862 --> 16:48.029
Esther, we've been through
a lot together,

16:48.031 --> 16:49.489
and we've certainly
had our differences,

16:49.491 --> 16:51.699
but I have always
been straight with you,

16:51.701 --> 16:53.075
and that's why
I'm coming to you,

16:53.077 --> 16:54.660
because I really want to
line up support

16:54.662 --> 16:56.621
for what might be coming
to Estonia.

16:56.623 --> 16:58.122
Personally, I agree.

16:58.124 --> 17:00.458
Russia should rise above
everything.

17:00.460 --> 17:04.127
But you're not the only one
with noise above you.

17:04.130 --> 17:06.506
Russia literally keeps
the lights on in Germany.

17:06.508 --> 17:09.008
Half of our energy
comes from them.

17:09.010 --> 17:11.301
I will do what I can to help,

17:11.304 --> 17:12.887
but you will have to
take the lead.

17:12.888 --> 17:14.262
Yes.

17:14.265 --> 17:16.223
Going three times.

17:16.226 --> 17:18.351
Sold at 700,000 Euros.

17:18.353 --> 17:19.519
Thank you, Yuki.

17:19.521 --> 17:21.229
I'm glad the channels are open.

17:21.231 --> 17:22.813
Let's keep talking.

17:22.815 --> 17:25.483
How's Daniel?

17:25.484 --> 17:27.944
He's fine. Last I heard,
he's out in the field.

17:27.945 --> 17:30.446
Yeah, yesterday he left me
a voicemail.

17:30.448 --> 17:32.156
He sounded distressed.

17:32.158 --> 17:34.075
Really?
In what way?

17:34.077 --> 17:36.619
It was personal, about his past.

17:36.621 --> 17:38.663
Hmm.
What time was that?

17:38.665 --> 17:41.207
Mid-afternoon.
Why?
No. No reason.

17:41.209 --> 17:43.626
You have never in your life
spoken for no reason.

17:43.628 --> 17:46.546
Talk soon.

17:46.548 --> 17:48.589
...starts right now.

20:57.947 --> 20:59.488
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

20:59.490 --> 21:01.657
I want it... I need to...

21:01.659 --> 21:03.534
How do you fucking
rewind this thing?

21:03.536 --> 21:06.162
Go back.

21:06.164 --> 21:08.539
Go back.
That part.

21:08.541 --> 21:11.000
There. Stop.

21:11.002 --> 21:15.546
That's the waitress
who poisoned Henrik.

21:15.548 --> 21:18.591
No fucking way it's an accident
she was there.

21:18.593 --> 21:21.343
Russians got to her first.

21:21.345 --> 21:22.762
Well, got to give them credit.

21:22.764 --> 21:24.263
They're willing to
tear down their monuments

21:24.265 --> 21:27.850
and kill their own people
in order to sell a story.

21:27.852 --> 21:29.727
Yeah, plus the waitress makes

21:29.729 --> 21:31.729
a very pretty murder
for the cause.

21:31.731 --> 21:34.148
She also ties up a loose end.

21:34.150 --> 21:36.192
Torres saw foxglove at her flat.

21:36.194 --> 21:37.568
He was headed over there today

21:37.570 --> 21:39.236
to try to connect her
to Henrik's murder.

21:39.238 --> 21:40.738
They're moving fast.

21:40.740 --> 21:42.031
By the time we get proof
of one thing,

21:42.033 --> 21:43.491
they're blowing up
something else.

21:43.493 --> 21:45.284
So the Russians have
stirred up the masses.

21:45.286 --> 21:48.704
That does not mean they can
get past NATO tripwire for us.

21:48.706 --> 21:50.289
I think it does.

21:50.291 --> 21:51.916
The tripwire activates
against foreign invaders.

21:51.918 --> 21:54.960
NATO can't intervene on internal
politics, even violence.

21:54.962 --> 21:56.629
Russia just keeps
yanking the chain

21:56.631 --> 21:58.422
until the hate machine
runs all by itself.

21:58.424 --> 22:00.508
The fire appears to
spontaneously ignite

22:00.510 --> 22:02.301
from within.

22:02.303 --> 22:05.471
At some point, the ethnic
Russians invite Russia in

22:05.473 --> 22:07.765
to be the protector...

22:07.767 --> 22:10.851
and the invaders
become the peacekeepers.

22:10.853 --> 22:12.853
Goodbye, Estonia.

22:12.855 --> 22:14.772
Okay, fuck protocol.

22:14.774 --> 22:16.732
Let's get Daniel back here.

22:16.734 --> 22:18.609
April, let's hear the options.

22:18.611 --> 22:20.069
Diplomatic channels.

22:20.071 --> 22:21.987
Official notice to
Estonian government,

22:21.989 --> 22:23.781
check local police
and hospitals.

22:23.783 --> 22:25.366
Done and done.
Skip to night action.

22:25.368 --> 22:26.867
Exfil hot extraction.

22:26.869 --> 22:29.161
The FBI's hostage rescue team
is busy in Africa,

22:29.163 --> 22:31.121
but JSOC can send a SEAL team

22:31.123 --> 22:33.290
down on the ground in Estonia
in maybe 10 hours.

22:33.292 --> 22:34.959
No, plus... plus two days

22:34.961 --> 22:36.961
to clear it through Langley
and SOCOM.

22:36.963 --> 22:38.963
Bureaucracy will be
a fucking nightmare.

22:38.965 --> 22:40.756
I can be there in four hours,
Valerie.

22:40.758 --> 22:43.342
No.
I need you here, Robert.

22:43.344 --> 22:45.094
You'll point the search
for Daniel.

22:45.096 --> 22:46.428
Let's get Torres into this.

22:46.430 --> 22:48.681
Reach out,
and you'll be his handler.

22:48.683 --> 22:51.267
Okay.

22:51.269 --> 22:53.435
Two GPS trackback markers.

22:53.437 --> 22:55.229
Daniel sent the first
yesterday afternoon

22:55.231 --> 22:57.189
when he reached the rail line
near Turba.

22:57.191 --> 22:59.149
Second ping came 12 hours ago

22:59.151 --> 23:02.987
as he was preparing to enter
a suspect tunnel complex.

23:02.989 --> 23:05.489
Well, Torres' people,
Special Activities,

23:05.491 --> 23:07.783
they live and breathe
"no man left behind."

23:07.785 --> 23:08.951
They'll track Daniel down.

23:08.953 --> 23:10.661
Where are you going?

23:10.663 --> 23:12.329
Favor for Langley.

23:12.331 --> 23:14.623
We're gonna need it.

23:14.625 --> 23:20.045
Mine-sniffing dolphins
trained by DARPA.

23:20.047 --> 23:22.715
Right.
Let's rewind just a bit,

23:22.717 --> 23:26.552
maybe give some historic context
for the uninitiated.

23:29.181 --> 23:32.683
Berlin Wall falls,
Iron Curtain rises.

23:32.685 --> 23:35.352
Capitalism wins.

23:35.354 --> 23:39.607
Except for those that risked
their lives to make that happen.

23:39.609 --> 23:41.901
We're forgotten.

23:41.903 --> 23:45.613
G.D., our resident retired
chip-on-his-shoulder,

23:45.615 --> 23:48.657
free-talking spook with
more nuggets too fucking crazy

23:48.659 --> 23:50.910
not to be true.

23:50.912 --> 23:53.412
Go back to those dolphins.

23:53.414 --> 23:56.415
So, we wanted to pump in
Michael Jackson,

23:56.417 --> 23:58.083
Big Macs, and blue jeans,

23:58.085 --> 24:00.586
hook the Soviets before
they changed their minds.

24:00.588 --> 24:04.715
Bush Sr., he turns to the Agency
and we turned to Diver.

24:04.717 --> 24:07.176
Full circle with Diver again.

24:07.178 --> 24:10.804
Surely he's a composite of
characters from over the years.

24:10.806 --> 24:13.641
As far as you know.

24:13.643 --> 24:16.727
Anyway, long story short,

24:16.729 --> 24:18.062
Diver trades a pod of

24:18.064 --> 24:21.148
DARPA-trained
mine-sniffing dolphins

24:21.150 --> 24:23.692
for the Russian
negotiating strategy

24:23.694 --> 24:26.320
at the '89 Malta Summit.

24:26.322 --> 24:28.656
<i>And guess what... we lied.</i>

24:28.658 --> 24:30.324
<i>We went and rolled out NATO</i>

24:30.326 --> 24:32.701
<i>right up to Russia's
Baltic doorstep...</i>

24:32.703 --> 24:35.829
<i>Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia.</i>

24:35.831 --> 24:37.456
<i>Russia has a long memory,</i>

24:37.458 --> 24:40.084
<i>and they're still
really pissed off about it.</i>

24:41.796 --> 24:43.462
Quite a story.

24:43.464 --> 24:47.132
Boy, haven't heard that voice
in years.

24:47.134 --> 24:48.801
It's gotten rougher.

24:48.803 --> 24:50.386
And less discreet.

24:50.388 --> 24:53.472
Agency says that
he's jeopardizing his pension.

24:53.474 --> 24:55.349
That bad, huh?

24:55.351 --> 24:56.600
Mm.

24:56.602 --> 24:59.019
Um, I suppose I could try.

24:59.021 --> 25:00.562
He was your mentor?

25:00.564 --> 25:01.772
And my boss.

25:01.774 --> 25:03.273
Then we were friends.

25:03.275 --> 25:06.735
Dorn was a swashbuckling,
um, le Carré type,

25:06.737 --> 25:09.863
and I was a...
Well, you worked with me.

25:11.534 --> 25:14.326
Well, the Agency would
consider it a favor.

25:14.328 --> 25:16.286
Yeah, favor's still
the coin of the realm.

25:16.288 --> 25:18.122
Okay.
I'll do my best.

25:18.124 --> 25:19.790
Speaking of which,

25:19.792 --> 25:23.210
I hear Berlin Station got lucky
with their new COS.

25:23.212 --> 25:25.254
Yeah, well-oiled machine.

25:25.256 --> 25:30.634
I must confess to a bit of, uh,
paternal pride.

25:30.636 --> 25:32.302
In me?

25:32.304 --> 25:34.263
You are not old enough, sir.

25:34.265 --> 25:35.806
Oh, yeah.

25:35.808 --> 25:38.225
But there's one thing
I don't get.

25:38.227 --> 25:40.978
You were always itching to
get out from behind the desk

25:40.980 --> 25:42.312
and into the action.

25:42.314 --> 25:45.315
Well, I guess that
placing my people

25:45.317 --> 25:48.277
in with the right mission
is where I need to be.

25:48.279 --> 25:50.863
- Okay.
- Yeah, speaking of my people,

25:50.865 --> 25:54.700
I heard this rumor that
you were trying to poach him

25:54.702 --> 25:57.369
before he settled on Tokyo.

25:57.371 --> 25:59.621
You really think
I'd go behind your back?

25:59.623 --> 26:01.248
Oh.

26:07.006 --> 26:09.423
What is it?

26:09.425 --> 26:11.091
Estonia?

26:11.093 --> 26:12.468
Daniel?

26:12.470 --> 26:14.428
Haven't heard from him yet?

26:14.430 --> 26:16.388
No, I haven't.

26:16.390 --> 26:18.474
Okay, well, don't sweat it
till you have to.

26:18.476 --> 26:20.684
This job's already hard enough.

26:20.686 --> 26:22.311
Thank you for Dorn.

26:22.313 --> 26:23.812
I'll let you know
how he takes it.

26:23.814 --> 26:25.481
Okay. Bye.

27:40.141 --> 27:41.723
Gilbert Dorn.

27:41.725 --> 27:43.016
It's been a dog's age.

27:43.018 --> 27:48.605
Um, it's my fault entirely.

27:48.607 --> 27:51.483
And after all these years.

27:51.485 --> 27:53.944
I'm glad it's you.

27:53.946 --> 27:55.904
Oh.

27:55.906 --> 27:58.615
Wow.

27:58.617 --> 28:00.993
Wow.

28:18.220 --> 28:21.388
This is, uh, quite a trove
you have here.

28:21.390 --> 28:25.434
The maid was a spy,
so I fired her.

28:25.436 --> 28:27.436
Are you here to kill me?

28:27.438 --> 28:29.188
Yeah, after I have my drink.

28:29.190 --> 28:31.315
You always had an oblique
sense of humor, you.

28:31.317 --> 28:34.568
Hey, I know that one.

28:34.570 --> 28:37.154
Is that Ulaanbaatar?

28:40.492 --> 28:42.743
What dog? What dog?

28:42.745 --> 28:44.494
Oh, my God, you kept that?

28:44.496 --> 28:46.997
That is impressive.

28:46.999 --> 28:49.458
What else do you have?

28:51.045 --> 28:54.338
Oh, now this... this looks way
too boring for the menagerie.

28:54.340 --> 28:57.382
That is our proof
of WMDs in Iraq.

28:57.384 --> 28:59.092
- That was you?
- Mm-hmm.

28:59.094 --> 29:01.678
Cut it myself from
an old tennis-ball machine.

29:05.017 --> 29:08.727
Oh, my God,
the stories, the stories.

29:11.440 --> 29:15.234
So, I hear you've been dabbling
in new technologies.

29:17.363 --> 29:20.197
I knew you didn't come for
the nickel tour.

29:22.076 --> 29:24.034
They're just stories, Steven.

29:24.036 --> 29:26.203
Gil, come on.

29:26.205 --> 29:30.582
We both know that every third or
fourth yarn you spin is true.

29:30.584 --> 29:32.793
Now, you knew the deal
when you signed up.

29:32.795 --> 29:36.004
Is that what
they told you to tell me?

29:36.006 --> 29:37.381
An honest bargain?

29:37.383 --> 29:39.007
No, it's just me.

29:39.009 --> 29:40.425
Guy who made the same bargain.

29:40.427 --> 29:43.136
Except you sold out.

29:43.138 --> 29:45.389
Just look at you.

29:45.391 --> 29:48.725
Your fancy fucking suit.

29:48.727 --> 29:51.186
You and I are nothing alike.

29:51.188 --> 29:53.897
I was 26 years old
when I made that bargain.

29:53.899 --> 29:56.400
And you've done
incredible things.

29:56.402 --> 29:58.902
You got to play a part
in history.

29:58.904 --> 30:01.196
I <i> am</i> history, goddamn it.

30:01.198 --> 30:02.948
What did I get for it?

30:02.950 --> 30:04.658
They won't even let you
keep the medal.

30:04.660 --> 30:06.410
Now, that's just self-pity.

30:06.412 --> 30:08.203
Really?

30:08.205 --> 30:10.497
Well, I'm done keeping secrets.

30:10.499 --> 30:12.332
I'm too old
and I don't give a damn.

30:12.334 --> 30:16.420
Gil.
Everything I did for my country,
nobody knew.

30:16.422 --> 30:18.297
They didn't even bother
to thank me.

30:18.299 --> 30:19.840
Okay.

30:19.842 --> 30:22.134
Um, Gil, thank you
for your service.

30:22.136 --> 30:25.053
Uh, now shut the fuck up.

30:25.055 --> 30:26.430
Or what?

30:27.975 --> 30:30.309
Okay, I'll... I'll put it in
a language you understand.

30:30.311 --> 30:34.021
You shut up, or the next player
that comes for a drink,

30:34.023 --> 30:37.983
he won't be so, uh, nostalgic
or interested in all this,

30:37.985 --> 30:39.985
and he won't fucking knock.

30:45.159 --> 30:51.246
"If you could hear,
at every jolt, the blood,"

30:51.248 --> 30:55.792
my friend, you would not tell
with such zest to children

30:55.794 --> 31:00.922
"ardent for some desperate glory,
the old lie."

31:00.924 --> 31:03.383
Come on, Gil.

31:03.385 --> 31:05.594
Jesus.

31:05.596 --> 31:07.888
Help me out here.

31:28.035 --> 31:29.868
It's good to see you, Gil.

31:44.218 --> 31:48.387
...as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

31:48.389 --> 31:51.723
And lead us not into temptation.

31:51.725 --> 31:53.975
But deliver us from evil,

31:53.977 --> 32:00.482
for thine is the Kingdom and
the power and the glory forever.

32:00.484 --> 32:02.943
Amen.

32:54.037 --> 32:55.579
Kirsch. Talk to me.

32:55.581 --> 32:57.831
I found something.

32:57.833 --> 32:59.624
Photo's on the way.

32:59.626 --> 33:01.251
You might want to
brace yourself.

33:04.840 --> 33:06.673
Valerie!

33:17.269 --> 33:19.769
Oh, dear God.

33:25.068 --> 33:26.902
What am I looking at?

33:26.904 --> 33:30.030
<i>Ground zero at Miller's
last known coordinates.</i>

33:30.032 --> 33:32.782
<i>Teeth are too smashed
and broken for I.D.,</i>

33:32.784 --> 33:35.911
<i>skin's too far gone
for any prints or scars,</i>

33:35.913 --> 33:37.787
<i>but I found a passport.</i>

33:37.789 --> 33:39.748
You're on site.
What's your assessment?

33:39.750 --> 33:41.583
That him?

33:41.585 --> 33:43.668
<i>- Yes and no.</i>
- Jesus Christ.

33:43.670 --> 33:46.922
It's classic Spetsnaz mindfuck.

33:46.924 --> 33:50.634
There's evidence for and against
a positive I.D.

33:50.636 --> 33:53.553
Messes with your fucking head
either way.

33:53.555 --> 33:57.307
Yeah. We waste days on I.D.
instead of countering.

33:57.309 --> 34:00.101
We can't call the authorities.

34:00.103 --> 34:02.103
Let Torres extract the body.

34:02.105 --> 34:04.481
No. Without a positive I.D.
in the field, it's too risky,

34:04.483 --> 34:06.024
and Torres is already
out on a limb.

34:06.026 --> 34:08.568
Okay.

34:08.570 --> 34:11.029
Torres.

34:11.031 --> 34:14.824
Do not, I repeat,
do not move the body.

34:14.826 --> 34:17.409
<i>Just get out of there now.</i>

34:17.411 --> 34:18.911
Copy that.

34:31.842 --> 34:34.135
I'll start the paperwork.

34:34.137 --> 34:37.179
Right. Thank you.

34:57.869 --> 35:00.453
Fuck that.

36:17.949 --> 36:22.285
- Be nice.

36:22.287 --> 36:23.995
Shit.

36:26.500 --> 36:28.917
Dad?

36:28.919 --> 36:31.628
We brought you dinner.

36:36.510 --> 36:38.093
Hello, you two.

36:38.095 --> 36:40.387
I bring good beer, good food,

36:40.389 --> 36:42.681
and the company of
a beautiful woman.

36:42.683 --> 36:46.101
I'm tempted greatly, but I'm
in the middle of something.

36:46.103 --> 36:47.894
Dad, please don't embarrass me.

36:47.896 --> 36:51.022
Let us in.
I'm sorry.
We shouldn't have come.

36:51.024 --> 36:55.360
You know you're always welcome
in my home, April.

36:55.362 --> 36:57.195
Maybe a rematch this weekend,
hmm?

36:57.197 --> 36:58.822
The board is set.

36:58.824 --> 37:00.990
Thanks.
I'll think about it.

37:06.748 --> 37:09.207
- Fuck him.
- Now, don't say that.

37:09.209 --> 37:11.710
I don't mean it like that.
It's just I'm sick of his shit.

37:11.712 --> 37:13.837
He tells people my mom
and sisters went to America

37:13.839 --> 37:15.714
to be with relatives,
but the truth,

37:15.716 --> 37:19.801
I think my mom just wanted
to be seen, listened to.

37:19.803 --> 37:22.846
And when he gets in the zone
being Mr. Fucking Genius,

37:22.848 --> 37:25.306
the whole world disappears.

37:25.308 --> 37:31.187
Well, you can't see it,
but he cares about you.

37:31.189 --> 37:33.481
It's why he's working so hard.

37:33.483 --> 37:37.819
I shouldn't fault his focus.

37:37.821 --> 37:40.780
What he's doing
is gonna be amazing.

37:40.782 --> 37:42.699
Thought you said he was done.

37:42.701 --> 37:44.033
He's mastered
the underlying tech,

37:44.035 --> 37:48.163
but there are more applications,
potential...

37:48.165 --> 37:50.582
For what?

37:53.336 --> 37:55.712
You never wanted
to go to America,

37:55.714 --> 37:57.422
be back with the rest
of your family?

37:57.424 --> 37:59.132
We applied for visas.

37:59.134 --> 38:00.633
Not happening.

38:00.635 --> 38:03.261
There's no special category
for scientists?

38:03.263 --> 38:05.472
Yeah, but there's
a more important category.

38:05.474 --> 38:06.890
"Shithole country."

38:08.518 --> 38:10.310
Would you miss me?

38:12.439 --> 38:15.064
Give me a minute.
I'll be back.

38:23.492 --> 38:24.908
What the fuck
are you doing here?

38:24.910 --> 38:26.075
I'm here for something.

38:27.954 --> 38:29.662
Hey! Hey!

38:29.664 --> 38:31.664
Leave him alone!

38:31.666 --> 38:33.374
Leave him alone!

38:33.376 --> 38:35.896
You don't want to
get involved in this.

38:36.588 --> 38:38.379
Try me.

38:38.381 --> 38:40.215
Your time is running out.

38:45.305 --> 38:46.471
Come on.

38:46.473 --> 38:48.014
Come on.

38:48.016 --> 38:49.182
Let's go.

38:50.852 --> 38:53.228
Can you help me?

38:54.523 --> 38:55.522
Geez.

38:57.025 --> 39:00.068
Dove, Dove, look at you.

39:00.070 --> 39:02.779
What have you done?

39:02.781 --> 39:05.114
I swear to God.
Are you okay?

39:05.116 --> 39:06.574
- Yes, I'm fine.
- All right.

39:06.576 --> 39:09.035
There's some tape under the...
Under the sink.

39:09.037 --> 39:10.203
I've got you.

39:10.205 --> 39:11.538
I've got you.

39:11.540 --> 39:13.248
Look at you.

39:13.250 --> 39:16.626
What happened?
- There was a guy.

39:16.628 --> 39:19.212
They were talking, and then
he just started pounding him.

39:19.214 --> 39:21.673
And he knew his name.

39:21.675 --> 39:24.801
Trouble, it has a way
of finding my son.

39:24.803 --> 39:27.303
They are like old friends.

39:27.305 --> 39:30.265
It's okay, April, you go.
I'll take care of him.

39:38.108 --> 39:39.691
- I'm fine.
- What?

39:39.693 --> 39:42.819
- I'm fine.
- What have you done, hmm?

39:48.243 --> 39:49.409
April.

39:49.411 --> 39:51.578
Thank you.

43:34.302 --> 43:39.055
Uh, his middle name...
What's his middle name?

43:39.057 --> 43:41.557
How the fuck do I not know it?

43:41.559 --> 43:45.520
Adam.
It's Adam.
