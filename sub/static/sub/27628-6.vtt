00:36.008 --> 00:37.088
Sorry, Sarge, couldn't find my
shoes.

00:37.088 --> 00:39.016
Constable!

00:39.016 --> 00:40.020
Come here.

00:46.060 --> 00:47.096
What does this say?

00:49.080 --> 00:54.048
Using unchristian language
in the presence of a police officer.

00:54.048 --> 00:57.000
You see, what it was, Sergeant,
I was up at Piper's Lake

00:57.000 --> 00:59.016
at the weekend and this bloke...
What have I told you?

00:59.016 --> 01:02.032
You write the exact offence
according to the law.

01:02.032 --> 01:04.075
Yeah, but I didn't know
which one to put, Sarge.

01:04.075 --> 01:09.000
Might I suggest if you don't know
what crime someone's committed,

01:09.000 --> 01:12.044
maybe you shouldn't
be arresting them.

01:12.044 --> 01:14.000
Sarge.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.024
Goodfellow, you're coming with me.

01:16.024 --> 01:17.048
Where's that, Sir?

01:17.048 --> 01:19.008
Jefferty's cottage.

01:19.008 --> 01:21.040
Down past the spinny,
I thought it was abandoned?

01:21.040 --> 01:24.020
A man's been spotted breaking in,
matches the description

01:24.020 --> 01:27.032
of Alan Tylett, the fugitive wanted
for brutally murdering

01:27.032 --> 01:29.000
a police officer.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.072
The press are calling him
the butcher of Bawdsley Green.

01:33.072 --> 01:35.088
And you want us to go
and arrest him, Sir?

01:35.088 --> 01:37.012
Precisely.

01:37.012 --> 01:39.036
We bring him in and I'll be
the toast of the force.

01:39.036 --> 01:42.004
Constable Blaisen,
round up all available officers,

01:42.004 --> 01:45.028
tell them to follow us,
but first call HQ,

01:45.028 --> 01:48.084
let them know what's happening.
What exactly is happening, Sir?

01:51.032 --> 01:52.076
What's keeping them?

01:56.020 --> 01:57.024
Goodfellow...

02:00.072 --> 02:02.096
While I've got you here, Sir,
I was hoping to have a word

02:02.096 --> 02:06.032
about young Colin. 
Let me stop you there, Sergeant.

02:06.032 --> 02:10.060
Constable Blaisen's father is the
divisional Chief Superintendent.

02:10.060 --> 02:13.012
I know, sir, Colin seems
a nice lad but...

02:13.012 --> 02:16.068
Ours is not to reason why,
ours is to help the boy

02:16.068 --> 02:19.012
commence his inevitable
rise through the ranks.

02:19.012 --> 02:22.004
Mark my words, he might not know his
truncheon from his elbow

02:22.004 --> 02:25.040
but that boy will outrank
us both by Christmas.

02:28.024 --> 02:29.032
I see movement.

02:30.084 --> 02:33.004
Let's go.Shouldn't we wait?

02:33.004 --> 02:35.028
I hear that Tylett killed
that officer in cold blood.

02:35.028 --> 02:38.036
That's exactly why
we can't let him escape.

02:38.036 --> 02:41.084
I'll take the front, you nip round
the back, head him off.

02:43.004 --> 02:44.028
Keep low.

02:46.052 --> 02:48.020
That's easier for some.

03:04.016 --> 03:06.092
Tylett. This is Inspector Mallory
of Kembleford police.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.028
We have the place surrounded.

03:21.080 --> 03:23.084
May as well give yourself up.

03:59.012 --> 04:00.020
Look out, sir!

04:06.064 --> 04:07.072
He's getting away.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.028
I think you've broke my collarbone.

04:15.048 --> 04:17.060
Goodfellow...

04:17.060 --> 04:19.012
Goodfellow!

04:56.072 --> 04:59.088
Seal off the area,
nobody touches anything.

04:59.088 --> 05:01.060
Any news on Goodfellow, Sir?

05:01.060 --> 05:03.056
Bullet went into his back.

05:03.056 --> 05:07.012
They've taken him straight to
hospital but it's not looking good.

05:07.012 --> 05:08.020
What were you thinking?

05:08.020 --> 05:12.048
I hoped we could apprehend
the suspect before... Hoped?

05:12.048 --> 05:15.008
The intelligence suggested
that Tylett was armed.

05:15.008 --> 05:17.096
You put a fellow officer's
life at risk and you let

05:17.096 --> 05:20.072
a dangerous criminal escape.

05:20.072 --> 05:24.008
Sir. At least tell me you got
a good look at the man.

05:26.040 --> 05:29.028
Took quite a whack on the head, Sir.
It's all a bit hazy.

05:30.040 --> 05:33.024
I was reading something, a notebook.

05:35.036 --> 05:38.052
I can't remember what was in it.
We'll find it.

05:38.052 --> 05:41.048
Concentrate on getting better.
Yes, Sir.

05:41.048 --> 05:44.028
We need you fit for that
disciplinary board.

05:44.028 --> 05:48.044
I've found something.
Where are your gloves?

05:50.032 --> 05:52.084
Sorry, Inspector.There go
the fingerprints.

05:52.084 --> 05:55.052
Don't be too hard on him.
This is your mess.

05:56.048 --> 05:57.056
Good work, lad.

06:05.068 --> 06:06.092
Can I help?

06:06.092 --> 06:09.040
We're looking for Sergeant
Daniel Goodfellow.

06:09.040 --> 06:12.060
He was brought in earlier this
morning. The policeman?Yes.

06:12.060 --> 06:15.068
He's in surgery.Oh!
Can you tell us how he is?

06:15.068 --> 06:18.060
You family? We're friends.
He's lost a lot of blood.

06:18.060 --> 06:22.056
The surgeon's trying to fix the
damage but... It's touch-and-go.

06:22.056 --> 06:24.044
Sorry.Crumbs.

06:33.056 --> 06:35.032
Don't get your hopes up.

06:35.032 --> 06:37.084
No need for the last rites just yet.

06:38.084 --> 06:42.016
Might I offer a prayer
for your swift recovery?

06:42.016 --> 06:45.036
Save your prayers for Goodfellow.
I don't deserve them.

06:48.068 --> 06:51.036
Is there anything
we can do to help you?

06:51.036 --> 06:52.080
Has your wife been informed?

06:52.080 --> 06:55.016
No, and don't even think
about telling her.

06:56.064 --> 07:00.008
Face that trial by fire
when I'm good and ready.

07:01.016 --> 07:03.028
Then I will leave you to recuperate.

07:04.096 --> 07:06.000
Padre, wait.

07:07.036 --> 07:08.072
There is something.

07:10.056 --> 07:13.088
I found a notebook in the cottage.
I think it might be important,

07:13.088 --> 07:17.024
could you ask Constable Blaisen
to bring it to me?

07:18.084 --> 07:21.060
I wouldn't ask, but I'm stuck here.
I would be happy to do so.

07:23.020 --> 07:27.032
And as for Sergeant Goodfellow,
God is with him.

07:31.060 --> 07:36.052
Not the best introduction
to life in the force.No.

07:36.052 --> 07:38.052
The sergeant, he's been so good to
me.

07:38.052 --> 07:41.092
If I'd just got the officers
there sooner...Not your fault.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.076
Now, Inspector Mallory has asked
if you would take him the notebook

07:46.076 --> 07:50.068
retrieved from the cottage.Dad!

07:50.068 --> 07:51.084
I mean, Sarge...

07:53.092 --> 07:56.080
We've had a call from Scotland Yard,
they've sent in an officer to take

07:56.080 --> 08:00.080
charge at the moment.Typical.
They give a name?

08:05.032 --> 08:09.036
Inspector Truman, Sir.
Inform me the moment he arrives.

08:09.036 --> 08:13.004
I'll be using Inspector
Mallory's office.

08:13.004 --> 08:15.084
The notebook's probably in the
evidence room, I'll check the log.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.056
I'm sorry, Father, I've searched
all through the evidence,

08:30.056 --> 08:31.080
there's no notebook.

08:33.048 --> 08:36.048
Inspector Truman. You should be
expecting me.

08:36.048 --> 08:39.000
Yes, sir, I'll just go and...

08:46.004 --> 08:48.092
Truman?Hello, Father. Long time,
no see.

08:52.064 --> 08:53.072
Here he is now.

08:59.056 --> 09:01.052
The surgeon reckons
the operation was a success

09:01.052 --> 09:03.084
but Sergeant Goodfellow
is still very weak.

09:03.084 --> 09:06.060
Where are his family?
Haven't they been informed?

09:06.060 --> 09:08.068
Apparently, Mrs Goodfellow
and the children are

09:08.068 --> 09:11.064
in Birmingham visiting relatives.
We've not been able to reach them.

09:11.064 --> 09:15.032
I'll stay with him until his family
arrive, however long it takes.

09:15.032 --> 09:16.036
Me too.

09:17.036 --> 09:19.076
Sergeant Goodfellow apprehended
the ruffian who tried

09:19.076 --> 09:21.092
to steal my favourite
handbag last week.

09:21.092 --> 09:24.076
If that won't win a girl's loyalty,
I don't know what will.

09:24.076 --> 09:26.060
All right, but please,
he needs rest.

09:26.060 --> 09:31.000
We'll be as quiet as the grave.
Sorry. Just slipped out.

09:44.088 --> 09:48.008
Inspector Mallory.And you are?

09:48.008 --> 09:50.052
You can call me Inspector Truman.

09:50.052 --> 09:52.088
Although I suspect some
of your officers

09:52.088 --> 09:54.064
will know him by another name.

09:56.004 --> 09:59.000
You've lost me.I used to be based
here in Kembleford.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.072
I'm trying to avoid drawing too much
attention to my presence.

10:02.072 --> 10:05.004
Is that so? Well, you can't be any
worse than the last man

10:05.004 --> 10:07.080
to keep my seat warm,
Mulligan, wasn't it?

10:07.080 --> 10:10.048
Bit of a jobsworth
from what I heard.

10:11.072 --> 10:13.096
I hear you had a run in
with Alan Tylett.

10:16.004 --> 10:17.092
Didn't set eyes on the man.

10:17.092 --> 10:20.068
My sergeant saw his
gun and jumped on me.

10:20.068 --> 10:23.008
So you've no idea where
Tylett was heading?

10:24.096 --> 10:27.064
I've been asked to take charge
of the investigation

10:27.064 --> 10:30.060
while you're recuperating.Well....

10:32.060 --> 10:37.008
Yes, thank you, Father, for your
assistance.Right.

10:37.008 --> 10:42.032
Yes. I'll go and see how Sergeant
Goodfellow is getting along.

10:42.032 --> 10:43.036
There's a good Father.

10:46.048 --> 10:49.012
There was a notebook
with Tylett's belongings.

10:49.012 --> 10:51.088
I think it contained
a list of names.

10:51.088 --> 10:55.076
Recognise any of them?
I don't remember.

10:55.076 --> 10:58.000
But I've got it in my
head that they were police.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.020
Now, what if Tylett's got
a grudge against coppers?

11:00.020 --> 11:03.080
And those names were his targets.
Exactly.

11:05.012 --> 11:08.084
Now, I've asked one of my constables
to... Fetch the notebook.

11:08.084 --> 11:12.060
I heard. Unfortunately, it appears
to have vanished.

11:14.044 --> 11:16.084
Vanished?Never made it to evidence.

11:21.004 --> 11:25.004
Fear not, I'll catch Tylett
before he can do any more damage.

11:33.084 --> 11:37.008
Inspector...Much as I'd relish
the opportunity to catch up,

11:37.008 --> 11:40.020
Father, I've a cold-blooded
killer to apprehend.

11:40.020 --> 11:42.020
Do you really?

11:45.080 --> 11:49.028
The gun at the scene of the crime
was loaded.Yes.

11:49.028 --> 11:52.084
Well, a cold-blooded killer
would be unlikely to flee

11:52.084 --> 11:54.040
while he still had ammunition,

11:54.040 --> 11:57.096
leaving Inspector Mallory
and Sergeant Goodfellow alive

11:57.096 --> 11:59.020
to identify him.

11:59.020 --> 12:02.056
And why dispose of the weapon
when he'd know that every single

12:02.056 --> 12:06.024
policeman within miles
would be hunting him down?

12:06.024 --> 12:10.048
No, it seems like the desperate act
of a frightened man.

12:12.092 --> 12:16.012
Father...I'll go back to St Mary's,
work on my homily.

12:16.012 --> 12:19.088
I was about to ask if you'd like
to accompany me to the crime scene.

12:22.064 --> 12:25.000
I've learned a lot since
leaving Kembleford.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.048
Specifically, the importance
of using all resources

12:27.048 --> 12:28.052
at my disposal.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.092
We need to find Alan Tylett
before anyone else gets hurt.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.024
Partners?

12:46.056 --> 12:48.036
That smell takes me back.

12:49.052 --> 12:52.052
It's spoiled but half eaten.

12:54.080 --> 12:59.024
Ugh. You'd have to be half starved
to force that down your throat.

12:59.024 --> 13:01.024
So why the alter ego?

13:01.024 --> 13:03.072
Since my encounter with
the Illuminati, I've been working

13:03.072 --> 13:07.020
with Special Branch
to tackle police corruption.

13:07.020 --> 13:11.020
When any of us are on assignments,
we use Truman as our cover.

13:11.020 --> 13:13.096
Tribute to a fallen colleague,

13:13.096 --> 13:16.036
and, of course, makes it
harder for our enemies

13:16.036 --> 13:17.060
to target us individually.

13:17.060 --> 13:22.020
So you think Alan Tylett's crime is
linked to police corruption?

13:22.020 --> 13:23.088
Tylett's been working for a violent
gang

13:23.088 --> 13:28.072
running protection rackets in
Birmingham. Kendal brothers.

13:28.072 --> 13:31.068
Our intelligence suggests that local
officers have been receiving

13:31.068 --> 13:33.036
payments from the gang.

13:33.036 --> 13:37.076
I suspect DS Muir was murdered
for refusing to co-operate.

13:37.076 --> 13:39.076
So if you can get to Tylett first...

13:39.076 --> 13:41.096
Hopefully, he can provide names
of any of the officers

13:41.096 --> 13:46.016
on the gang's payroll.What makes
you think he'll co-operate?

13:46.016 --> 13:50.008
I'll offer him life imprisonment
rather than the gallows.

13:50.008 --> 13:52.088
It's an incentive
that usually works.

13:52.088 --> 13:58.056
That's, of course, if they don't get
to him first.Yes. Quite.

13:59.084 --> 14:02.072
Now I understand your
choice of partner.

14:02.072 --> 14:06.020
Someone from outside
the police force.

14:06.020 --> 14:07.080
Someone you can trust.

14:11.024 --> 14:12.092
I wouldn't go that far!

14:20.016 --> 14:22.084
Looks like he's been
injecting drugs.

14:24.008 --> 14:29.000
Amphetamines, maybe. I'll get the
laboratory to test this.

14:30.016 --> 14:31.020
Or...

14:33.088 --> 14:39.072
Insulin.He's a diabetic.
No wonder he was desperate for food.

14:39.072 --> 14:42.096
After days on the run, his blood
sugar must have plummeted.

14:42.096 --> 14:45.056
He ran off without taking his
belongings, so we can assume

14:45.056 --> 14:48.044
he doesn't have any
more insulin on him.

14:54.008 --> 14:55.088
I've checked with the pharmacy,

14:55.088 --> 14:58.052
all our insulin stocks are accounted
for. What makes you think

14:58.052 --> 14:59.060
he'll come here?

14:59.060 --> 15:02.016
He won't have the energy to traipse
through village to village

15:02.016 --> 15:04.048
until he gets lucky.
This is his best bet.

15:04.048 --> 15:06.088
If he did try elsewhere,
I've got officers keeping an eye

15:06.088 --> 15:10.008
on every doctor's surgery and
chemist within a five mile radius.

15:10.008 --> 15:12.052
Oh, but the medicines
here are kept under lock and key

15:12.052 --> 15:14.080
and the pharmacist is on duty
throughout the day.

15:14.080 --> 15:17.016
Which is why he'll probably
wait until nightfall.

15:17.016 --> 15:18.028
I'll speak to Matron,

15:18.028 --> 15:20.044
double check all the windows and
doors are locked.

15:20.044 --> 15:23.024
Station officers outside, then...
No, we don't want to scare him.

15:24.032 --> 15:26.012
Let's give him exactly what
he wants.

15:39.016 --> 15:40.088
What are you doing here?

15:42.028 --> 15:43.052
Looking for this?

15:46.060 --> 15:47.072
Yeah.

15:49.056 --> 15:51.028
All right. Just stay back,
all right?

16:16.020 --> 16:17.024
Surprise.

16:18.092 --> 16:21.096
Wait, the priest? You're going to
kill me, aren't you?

16:21.096 --> 16:24.004
No!We'll let the hangman
do that, shall we?

16:24.004 --> 16:27.004
Alan Tylett, you're under arrest
for the murder of DS Phillip Muir

16:27.004 --> 16:29.080
and the attempted murder
of Sergeant Daniel Goodfellow.

16:29.080 --> 16:32.056
You are not obliged to say anything,
but anything you do say...

16:32.056 --> 16:34.052
What do you mean, attempted murder?

16:34.052 --> 16:36.044
The police officer
you shot at the cottage.

16:36.044 --> 16:37.084
I didn't shoot nobody.

16:37.084 --> 16:40.032
I didn't kill that other copper
either, I'm being set up.

16:40.032 --> 16:43.088
Of course you are. Let's discuss
this at the station. No!

16:43.088 --> 16:46.076
Please don't take me in. I'll tell
you everything you want to know.

16:46.076 --> 16:49.092
You'll be perfectly safe in a cell.
No, I won't, not with those people.

16:49.092 --> 16:52.052
If you put me inside, they're going
to kill me.He has a point.

17:01.068 --> 17:03.068
Oh, you scared me.

17:03.068 --> 17:06.023
I wanted to surprise you.
I'm hardly in the condition.

17:06.023 --> 17:08.068
Anyway, patients are sleeping,
what you doing here?

17:08.068 --> 17:10.044
My dad sent me to watch
over the Sarge.

17:13.016 --> 17:16.000
I miss you. These shifts, I barely
get to see you.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.064
A couple more weeks,
we'll be waking up together

17:18.064 --> 17:20.036
in our own little cottage.
Which is good

17:20.036 --> 17:21.079
because if you get any bigger,

17:21.079 --> 17:26.016
everyone's going to know how naughty
your mummy's been.

17:26.016 --> 17:27.051
Shut up! Stop it.

17:27.051 --> 17:28.071
That's...

17:28.071 --> 17:31.004
I do hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

17:31.004 --> 17:35.004
Sorry, this is my fiance, Colin.

17:35.004 --> 17:37.076
Colin, this is Mrs McCarthy.

17:37.076 --> 17:40.016
Where is the doctor?
I need to speak to him.

17:40.016 --> 17:43.048
Sergeant Goodfellow is showing no
signs of improvement.

17:43.048 --> 17:44.060
That's to be expected.

17:44.060 --> 17:46.052
First 24 hours are about keeping
him stable

17:46.052 --> 17:48.020
and making sure his wounds are
clean.

17:48.020 --> 17:52.000
He's allergic to penicillin, so any
infection could be very serious.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.012
But we are doing everything we can,
I swear.

17:54.012 --> 17:57.092
Oh, and that includes
canoodling in laundry rooms.

17:57.092 --> 18:00.028
I'll go and check on Sergeant
Goodfellow straight away.

18:04.008 --> 18:06.080
Like I said, I was in the outhouse
around the back.

18:11.092 --> 18:14.068
I saw your copper going in the back
door and I scarpered.

18:14.068 --> 18:18.068
When I heard the gun, I thought
he was shooting at me. Mm.

18:18.068 --> 18:21.056
Father, I'm telling the truth.
I believe you.

18:24.000 --> 18:28.072
Let's go back. What prompted this
sudden desire to go straight?

18:28.072 --> 18:31.036
Your criminal record could stretch
from here to Timbuktu.

18:31.036 --> 18:35.084
I'm sick of it. The game's changed.

18:35.084 --> 18:38.032
Gangs are controlling everything.
I'm not a violent man.

18:38.032 --> 18:41.088
I only got into it because no-one
would give us a job.

18:41.088 --> 18:46.092
So you went to see DS Muir and...
Told him I could give him names.

18:46.092 --> 18:48.056
Bent coppers.

18:48.056 --> 18:50.080
In exchange for protection.

18:50.080 --> 18:53.092
Why trust him? How could you be sure
he wasn't corrupt?

18:53.092 --> 18:56.076
Yeah, because I heard the Kendal
brothers talking about him.

18:56.076 --> 18:59.032
How he'd arrested one
of their mates and refused a tip

18:59.032 --> 19:00.080
to turn a blind eye.

19:00.080 --> 19:04.044
Anyway, so Muir says he'll talk
to one of his bosses,

19:04.044 --> 19:06.096
someone who could arrange things.

19:06.096 --> 19:09.028
Only the following night,
this noise wakes me up.

19:10.096 --> 19:12.000
Hello?

19:13.076 --> 19:16.008
I go downstairs, and there he is.

19:18.076 --> 19:21.036
I guess Muir's boss ain't
as clean as he thought.

19:25.004 --> 19:27.060
As soon as I saw the body,
I knew I was being set up.

19:27.060 --> 19:31.072
I grabbed what I could
and I scarpered.

19:31.072 --> 19:34.084
And the names in the notebook?

19:36.012 --> 19:38.048
They're all officers
you think have taken bribes.

19:38.048 --> 19:41.000
I don't think, I know.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.048
The notebook's only half of it.

19:48.072 --> 19:52.016
I stole this from Michael Langborn.

19:52.016 --> 19:53.088
Tricky Mickey.

19:53.088 --> 19:57.008
He does the books for
the Kendal brothers.

19:57.008 --> 20:00.028
These accounts include
a list of payments.

20:00.028 --> 20:02.096
Each one has an initial next to it.

20:02.096 --> 20:06.016
And those initials, they correspond
to the names on your list.

20:06.016 --> 20:09.024
Concrete evidence
of police corruption.

20:09.024 --> 20:14.020
If you get me the notebook back,
maybe I can still make a deal.Ah.

20:15.096 --> 20:20.040
There may be a problem with that.
The notebook's gone missing.

20:20.040 --> 20:21.044
Oh, no!

20:22.060 --> 20:23.064
I knew it.

20:28.052 --> 20:32.060
There's one name on the list
I should have mentioned.

20:44.080 --> 20:46.048
As you were.

20:46.048 --> 20:49.016
Just popped in to check
on Goodfellow.

20:49.016 --> 20:53.060
How's the shoulder?On the mend,
sir. Has Truman found Tylett?

20:53.060 --> 20:54.064
No word yet.

20:55.092 --> 20:57.036
That's why I'm here.

20:58.072 --> 21:02.016
Perhaps it's best we take matters
back into our own hands.

21:02.016 --> 21:05.092
Sir?I'm intending to do a bit
of investigating myself,

21:05.092 --> 21:10.052
see if I can speed things along.
This notebook you mentioned...

21:11.084 --> 21:14.064
Don't suppose you've been able
to recall its contents.

21:17.032 --> 21:18.072
It's still a bit foggy, sir.

21:19.080 --> 21:24.068
Must be the painkillers they've got
me on. I see.

21:24.068 --> 21:27.060
If you remember, you tell me first.

21:27.060 --> 21:30.048
I don't want you talking
to anyone else about it.

21:30.048 --> 21:31.056
Not even Truman.

21:33.008 --> 21:35.060
As you say, sir.

21:35.060 --> 21:36.076
Excellent.

22:32.012 --> 22:33.016
Thank you.

22:42.036 --> 22:45.048
Why are you in here, Father?Waiting
for you, Chief Superintendent.

22:45.048 --> 22:49.096
I was told you'd gone to the
hospital.Yes, and now I'm back.

22:49.096 --> 22:55.088
Well?St Mary's would like
to organise a special event,

22:55.088 --> 22:59.008
to raise money for Sergeant
Goodfellow and his family.

22:59.008 --> 23:02.000
Whatever happens, the next few weeks
are going to be difficult for them.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.016
A kind thought, Father,

23:03.016 --> 23:05.060
and in principle you have my full
support,

23:05.060 --> 23:08.072
but don't you think
we should wait until the Sergeant

23:08.072 --> 23:11.076
is out of immediate danger?

23:11.076 --> 23:13.052
Yes, of course.

23:15.004 --> 23:17.080
You're right.Now, if
you don't mind,

23:17.080 --> 23:21.016
my priority is catching the man who
did this to him.

23:21.016 --> 23:23.040
Of course. Thank you.

23:29.072 --> 23:32.084
I need the toilet.You've just been.

23:32.084 --> 23:34.096
Yeah, well, I've got a
weak bladder. Tough.

23:39.096 --> 23:43.004
KNOCKING
It's me.

23:44.004 --> 23:46.068
Father Brown.Come.

23:52.040 --> 23:53.056
I got your note.

23:54.052 --> 23:55.072
Why come back here?

23:55.072 --> 23:59.004
Couldn't risk any of your flock
dropping by and seeing him.

23:59.004 --> 24:00.008
Any luck?

24:04.096 --> 24:06.088
You were right.

24:06.088 --> 24:08.076
Chief Superintendent Blaisen had it.

24:10.032 --> 24:12.024
His name's in it.

24:12.024 --> 24:14.000
Along with about a dozen others.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.080
I think you should take Mr Tylett
and the evidence

24:16.080 --> 24:19.088
to the Special Branch, while you
still have a chance.

24:19.088 --> 24:22.036
We've got safe houses in London
where I can hide him

24:22.036 --> 24:26.036
until he testifies, but...
might not be that simple.

24:27.044 --> 24:28.052
What do you mean?

24:28.052 --> 24:31.060
If the Chief Superintendent fired
the gun, there's every chance

24:31.060 --> 24:34.036
Goodfellow could identify him,
were he to wake up.

24:34.036 --> 24:36.096
So you think he'll try
and finish Goodfellow off?

24:36.096 --> 24:40.080
If he's that dirty, he'll do
anything to avoid being exposed.

24:40.080 --> 24:43.024
I need to get to the hospital.
No.

24:43.024 --> 24:45.060
No. I'll go.

24:47.024 --> 24:51.084
You need to stay here
with Mr Tylett, and we can't risk

24:51.084 --> 24:54.024
Chief Superintendent Blaisen
knowing we're on to him.

24:56.040 --> 24:57.044
Go, quickly.

24:59.060 --> 25:01.072
I've got to get back,
or I'll get in trouble.

25:01.072 --> 25:04.080
And you're supposed to be watching
the Sergeant.Just one more minute.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.016
I need help. Doctor!

25:33.016 --> 25:36.064
Oh, I must have dozed
off for a moment.

25:38.044 --> 25:39.052
Just give him some room.

25:43.032 --> 25:45.084
What's happened? I just popped out
to get us some breakfast.

25:45.084 --> 25:47.076
I don't know.His breathing changed.

25:47.076 --> 25:49.056
Oh, no.

25:51.012 --> 25:53.008
What are they doing to him?

25:53.008 --> 25:54.060
He could be dying.

25:57.092 --> 26:00.024
You were going to quit the job
anyway when the baby comes.

26:00.024 --> 26:02.088
Yeah, but not for ever. I thought I
might come back to it one day.

26:02.088 --> 26:04.072
Now I might not have a choice.
It's my fault,

26:04.072 --> 26:08.000
I shouldn't have distracted you.
I let you, didn't I?

26:08.000 --> 26:10.040
He's hanging on.They blame me.

26:10.040 --> 26:12.092
I'm being hauled in front of Matron
first thing tomorrow.

26:12.092 --> 26:16.020
The doctor said something
about a mistake in medication.

26:16.020 --> 26:18.052
I gave the Sergeant something
for his blood pressure,

26:18.052 --> 26:20.068
but that's it. Doesn't
make any sense.

26:20.068 --> 26:22.032
How long were you away
from the ward?

26:24.024 --> 26:25.044
Half an hour, maybe.

26:25.044 --> 26:27.084
Long enough for someone to see
the coast was clear,

26:27.084 --> 26:30.080
and then inject Sergeant Goodfellow
with penicillin?

26:30.080 --> 26:32.048
Why would anyone do that?

26:32.048 --> 26:37.020
Because were he to awake, he might
identify the man who shot him.

26:37.020 --> 26:40.036
Father, we know who shot him,
it was Alan Tylett.

26:40.036 --> 26:43.040
So what, he came back
to finish off the job?Well...

26:43.040 --> 26:47.004
You think it was someone else?
Who?I can't say.

26:47.004 --> 26:49.012
Not without proof.

26:49.012 --> 26:51.064
But if I find out for sure,
it may be enough for you to get

26:51.064 --> 26:53.052
your job back.What can we do?

26:53.052 --> 26:57.048
Because we will not stand
idly by while some madman tries

26:57.048 --> 27:01.008
to kill Sergeant Goodfellow once
and for all.Stay with him.

27:01.008 --> 27:03.060
But...Make sure no-one
tries anything.

27:03.060 --> 27:06.056
Very well, we shall
guard him with our lives. Yes.

27:28.088 --> 27:29.096
Only me.

27:34.036 --> 27:36.004
I just wanted to say...

27:37.064 --> 27:39.004
You were right.

27:39.004 --> 27:40.064
We should have waited.

27:41.064 --> 27:46.056
Instead, because of me, you're lying
here in a right old state.

27:48.016 --> 27:51.004
So in case I don't get
another chance...

27:53.052 --> 27:54.056
Sorry.

27:56.092 --> 27:58.048
And thank you.

27:58.048 --> 28:00.040
Not just for saving my
backside, but for...

28:03.040 --> 28:04.044
..everything.

28:07.008 --> 28:08.072
You're a fine officer.

28:11.080 --> 28:12.092
And a fine friend.

28:20.036 --> 28:23.012
I was just giving Goodfellow
a stern talking to.

28:23.012 --> 28:25.080
Just like him to be lazing in bed
when he should be on the beat.

28:28.084 --> 28:33.000
Did you happen to notice anyone
near Sergeant Goodfellow

28:33.000 --> 28:34.092
before the allergic reaction?

28:36.016 --> 28:39.068
You think...?I fear so.

28:39.068 --> 28:43.052
Oh, unless Miss Windermere
or Mrs McCarthy were responsible.

28:43.052 --> 28:46.016
Don't be absurd.Then the only other
people I saw with him

28:46.016 --> 28:49.088
were the pretty nurse and the
doctors.Nobody else?

28:51.064 --> 28:54.012
Well... The chief super
went to check on him.

28:54.012 --> 28:57.020
And he's hardly likely to bump off
one of his best sergeants, is he?

29:01.048 --> 29:03.036
Any chance we can lose the cuffs?

29:03.036 --> 29:06.060
So you can do a runner?
You know it weren't me.

29:06.060 --> 29:11.060
All I know is, I need your testimony
to bring those officers to justice.

29:11.060 --> 29:14.056
It won't change nothing. Dirty
coppers are like weeds,

29:14.056 --> 29:18.032
you get rid of a few, and new ones
just grow in their place.

29:19.092 --> 29:21.056
What took you so long?

29:21.056 --> 29:24.080
Someone injected Sergeant
Goodfellow with penicillin.

29:24.080 --> 29:28.036
He's allergic, he went into shock.
Someone?

29:28.036 --> 29:30.092
Chief Superintendent Blaisen
was seen with him

29:30.092 --> 29:33.072
a few minutes before his
condition deteriorated.

29:35.008 --> 29:36.048
He's a senior officer.

29:37.096 --> 29:41.040
Special Branch or not,
I can't touch him without proof.

29:41.040 --> 29:43.020
So, how do we get it?

29:49.004 --> 29:50.048
We use a trick.

29:52.020 --> 29:53.064
Taught to me by an old friend.

29:57.068 --> 29:59.056
PHONE RINGS

30:01.096 --> 30:04.032
Divisional Chief Superintendent
Blaisen speaking.

30:05.096 --> 30:07.004
You've got him?

30:08.012 --> 30:10.052
Excellent. I'll be there
straight away.

30:10.052 --> 30:12.052
And don't tell Birmingham just yet.

30:12.052 --> 30:14.048
We'll keep it to ourselves.

30:23.092 --> 30:27.024
Constable Blaisen. Yes, Sir.
Give me your notebook.

30:27.024 --> 30:28.040
My notebook, sir?

30:29.064 --> 30:31.064
I was told never to lend
it to anyone else.

30:31.064 --> 30:33.072
I think you can make
an exception just this once.

30:36.004 --> 30:37.072
What do you need it for anyway,
Sir?

30:37.072 --> 30:40.036
I've started remembering
some of the names on Tylett's list.

30:40.036 --> 30:42.028
I want to write them
down before I forget again.

30:43.052 --> 30:46.044
Good news. Doctor says you can go,
soon as we've sorted your paperwork.

30:46.044 --> 30:49.020
At last.And they want you back
in a fortnight to check

30:49.020 --> 30:51.092
how it's healing.No problem, I'll
see you then.

30:52.088 --> 30:55.004
Doubt I'll still be here,
but they'll make sure

30:55.004 --> 30:56.016
you're looked after.

30:56.016 --> 30:57.040
You get some rest now.

30:57.040 --> 31:00.036
Absolutely. Straight home to put
my feet up.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.068
Just as soon as Tylett's
behind bars.

31:11.084 --> 31:12.088
Truman.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.088
What the devil's going on?

31:18.004 --> 31:19.080
Sir.Problem?

31:19.080 --> 31:21.024
No, Sir.

31:25.008 --> 31:26.072
Come on, Sir.

31:26.072 --> 31:29.040
He killed one of our officers
and put another in hospital,

31:29.040 --> 31:33.016
you can hardly expect me not
to ruffle his feathers.

31:35.032 --> 31:36.092
All things considered.

31:38.068 --> 31:43.008
Strictly between us, I,
I'm concerned he intends to make

31:43.008 --> 31:45.032
false statements against
some of our colleagues

31:45.032 --> 31:47.028
in the Birmingham City police,

31:47.028 --> 31:50.080
damaging their otherwise
untarnished reputations.

31:52.008 --> 31:55.024
I believe it's my duty
to dissuade him.

31:56.076 --> 31:57.084
Why don't I have a word?

31:59.044 --> 32:00.060
Very well, Sir.

32:07.092 --> 32:09.024
Here.

32:09.024 --> 32:13.016
In case he gets out of hand.
Or tries to escape.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.040
I'll be outside having a smoke.

32:29.072 --> 32:30.096
Oh, please, don't.

32:32.028 --> 32:34.036
Hey, I'm just here
to talk, that's all.

32:34.036 --> 32:37.032
Look, I didn't shoot DS Muir.

32:37.032 --> 32:40.088
I know, but the information
you gave him, he wanted to take

32:40.088 --> 32:42.064
to the top brass.

32:42.064 --> 32:44.072
So my friends had no other choice.

32:44.072 --> 32:48.084
You've been disloyal, Tylett,
and now you're in a very deep hole.

32:48.084 --> 32:52.008
Let's see if we can get
you out of it, eh?

32:52.008 --> 32:56.016
Where's the accounts book you stole?
It's there.

32:56.016 --> 32:57.020
Where?

33:00.016 --> 33:03.068
Look, please, I won't say anything,
just don't send me to the gallows.

33:03.068 --> 33:07.060
Very well. If you prefer
another alternative.

33:07.060 --> 33:08.080
What are you doing?

33:08.080 --> 33:11.056
Just protecting the interests
of my employers.

33:11.056 --> 33:17.088
It, it was you, wasn't it? You shot
that other copper downstairs.

33:17.088 --> 33:19.040
Me? No.

33:19.040 --> 33:22.016
I was 20 miles away at a meeting
of the watch committee.

33:22.016 --> 33:24.084
You're lying.If I wanted to bump
off a fellow officer of the law,

33:24.084 --> 33:27.024
do you think I would be stupid
enough to do it myself?

33:27.024 --> 33:29.024
Look, just stop. Who'd believe me
anyway?

33:29.024 --> 33:32.008
It'd be your word against that of
a known criminal.

33:34.020 --> 33:35.024
Oh.

33:38.012 --> 33:40.016
And that of another
officer of the law.

33:42.092 --> 33:44.024
And a priest.

33:44.024 --> 33:46.084
And you're right,
you didn't need to shoot

33:46.084 --> 33:49.056
Sergeant Goodfellow,
someone did it for you.

33:55.092 --> 33:57.036
Fancy a lift home, Sir?

33:57.036 --> 34:00.004
No, you can take me back
to Jefferty's cottage.

34:00.004 --> 34:03.020
Let's see if we can find that
notebook. Very well, Sir.

34:09.092 --> 34:11.068
Where is Constable Blaisen?

34:11.068 --> 34:16.000
Oh, he left about ten
minutes ago. Why?

34:16.000 --> 34:18.040
I'll check the station. You
stay with Goodfellow.

34:18.040 --> 34:21.007
Is Colin in danger?Not exactly.

34:21.007 --> 34:24.060
When was Inspector
Mallory discharged?

34:24.060 --> 34:27.083
A short while ago, just before
Colin left. Father...

34:27.083 --> 34:29.060
Look.

34:35.007 --> 34:38.004
Isn't it quicker going
down Wyatt's Lane?

34:38.004 --> 34:42.056
Sorry, Sir, I was miles away,
I'll find somewhere to turn round.

34:48.007 --> 34:49.052
It's all a bit of a blur.

34:51.060 --> 34:52.063
I remember...

34:53.096 --> 34:55.000
Colin.

34:56.088 --> 34:58.080
Why would the lad do
something like that?

34:58.080 --> 35:00.068
No time to explain.

35:00.068 --> 35:04.080
Is there anywhere he would go
if he wanted to hide?

35:04.080 --> 35:07.068
I can't think.Sergeant, it
is important.

35:09.088 --> 35:12.060
He's mentioned Piper's Light before.

35:12.060 --> 35:15.064
I think he goes fishing
there at weekends.

35:15.064 --> 35:19.084
That's not far from here.
It's isolated. Hidden from the road.

35:20.092 --> 35:23.060
Mrs McCarthy, would you telephone
the police station and tell

35:23.060 --> 35:26.064
Inspector Sullivan to meet me
at the lake?

35:29.016 --> 35:32.076
Might as well save your energy.
You're going to need it.

35:32.076 --> 35:35.004
Have you any idea what
they do to coppers in jail?

35:44.016 --> 35:46.000
Just leave me here!

35:49.012 --> 35:52.028
They know everything anyway. If you
kill me, you'll just make it worse.

35:55.088 --> 35:59.048
No, no, no, please don't.You know
what they say, a little knowledge is

35:59.048 --> 36:00.080
a dangerous thing.

36:02.040 --> 36:05.016
Well, where are you going now?

36:05.016 --> 36:07.000
I said the cottage.

36:12.016 --> 36:14.084
That should be locked
up in evidence.

36:18.028 --> 36:20.052
Get out. Get out.

36:25.016 --> 36:29.048
Whatever's going on, lad,
this isn't the answer. Quiet.

36:29.048 --> 36:31.076
Please do me the decency
of telling me why?

36:31.076 --> 36:34.032
I can't risk you remembering.
Remembering what?

36:39.060 --> 36:42.076
That his father is on the list
of police officers

36:42.076 --> 36:45.056
taking kickbacks from criminals.

36:45.056 --> 36:50.008
So, the Chief Super's on the take.
No, no, he's lying.

36:50.008 --> 36:54.024
Chief Superintendent Blaisen
had already been tipped off

36:54.024 --> 36:58.056
about evidence of police corruption
stolen by Alan Tylett.

36:58.056 --> 37:02.056
And when young Colin called him
to say that Tylett had been spotted,

37:02.056 --> 37:05.028
he ordered you to retrieve it.
Didn't he?

37:05.028 --> 37:08.056
By any means, you understand?

37:08.056 --> 37:11.020
Get that notebook or we're finished.

37:11.020 --> 37:12.060
Not just me, both of us,

37:12.060 --> 37:17.056
and you can kiss your wedding
to that strumpet goodbye. Now go.

37:17.056 --> 37:22.060
It wasn't Goodfellow that Tylett saw
going into the cottage,

37:22.060 --> 37:23.064
it was you.

37:24.076 --> 37:26.044
You thought you'd have time

37:26.044 --> 37:32.056
while Inspector Mallory waited
for backup, but he didn't wait.

37:32.056 --> 37:33.084
Tylett!

37:35.016 --> 37:39.084
This is Inspector Mallory
of Kembleford Police.

37:39.084 --> 37:42.004
We have the place surrounded.

37:44.076 --> 37:47.036
May as well give yourself up.

37:53.048 --> 37:55.032
It wasn't my fault.

37:55.032 --> 37:57.032
I was just trying to scare him off.

37:57.032 --> 37:59.080
I was aiming to miss,
only the Sergeant jumped in the way.

37:59.080 --> 38:01.084
Look out, sir!

38:18.044 --> 38:21.048
You didn't aim to miss
when you injected Goodfellow

38:21.048 --> 38:24.064
with penicillin, though, did you?
That was attempted murder.

38:24.064 --> 38:27.048
No, that wasn't me.
No, that was his father...

38:29.056 --> 38:32.072
..trying to make sure that
Goodfellow didn't identify you.

38:34.060 --> 38:36.080
He said he'd take care
of everything.

38:36.080 --> 38:39.008
I never meant for any of
this to happen.

38:39.008 --> 38:42.048
And God will forgive you, Colin,
if you truly repent,

38:42.048 --> 38:47.056
but you cannot let another man take
the blame for what you've done.

38:47.056 --> 38:48.080
What about Alice?

38:50.016 --> 38:52.000
What about my baby?

38:52.000 --> 38:53.040
I've messed everything up.

38:53.040 --> 38:57.076
Yes, which is why you owe
it to them to make this right.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.092
Be strong and tell the truth, Colin.

39:20.092 --> 39:23.076
What's going to happen to me?
Release the lad.

39:23.076 --> 39:28.040
Dad.He's confessed to shooting
Sergeant Goodfellow.

39:28.040 --> 39:31.060
Nonsense, he's trying to protect me.

39:33.020 --> 39:36.016
I shot Goodfellow. But...Quiet.

39:38.064 --> 39:41.044
You said you were 20 miles away.

39:41.044 --> 39:45.056
I lied.Or you're lying now, to
save your son.

39:48.032 --> 39:52.012
Wait, what have you done with
Tylett? He's escaped.

39:52.012 --> 39:55.040
He's back on the run.If you've hurt
him... You'll what?

39:57.004 --> 39:59.088
Because I doubt it's worse
than what's in store for me.

39:59.088 --> 40:01.092
Where is he?I let him go.

40:03.012 --> 40:04.028
An act of mercy.

40:06.068 --> 40:10.032
If you'd forced him to testify
against corrupt officers,

40:10.032 --> 40:13.084
he'd be dead before they ever got
to the court.

40:13.084 --> 40:15.024
That list of names?

40:15.024 --> 40:18.016
It's just the tip of the iceberg.

40:18.016 --> 40:20.016
So why are you here?
To make a deal.

40:21.088 --> 40:24.020
I'm willing to testify
in Tylett's place.

40:24.020 --> 40:27.088
Name every dirty cop
in the Midlands.

40:29.084 --> 40:33.036
Just as long as you keep my son out
of it.Dad, you don't need do this.

40:35.084 --> 40:39.048
I'll even tell you who
really killed DS Muir.

40:39.048 --> 40:41.020
But only if Colin walks.

40:45.076 --> 40:47.012
He is just a lad.

40:49.012 --> 40:50.040
None of this is his fault.

40:52.052 --> 40:56.008
Send him away and they will tear
him to pieces.

41:22.004 --> 41:23.092
Any chance of a lift into town?

41:23.092 --> 41:26.092
Inspector Sullivan!
What a nice surprise.

41:26.092 --> 41:29.036
Good to see some colour
back in your cheeks, Goodfellow.

41:29.036 --> 41:32.024
And you should be at
home resting, sir.

41:32.024 --> 41:36.008
I wanted to tell you in person that
your attacker has been arrested.

41:36.008 --> 41:38.092
I still can't believe the lad
would do such a thing.

41:38.092 --> 41:42.084
Actually, it was his father,
the Chief Super.

41:42.084 --> 41:46.040
He had us all fooled.But I remember
seeing Colin's face.

41:46.040 --> 41:49.012
Strange thing, memory
is, Goodfellow.

41:49.012 --> 41:50.060
Plays all sorts of tricks,

41:50.060 --> 41:54.048
especially after a particularly
traumatic incident.

41:54.048 --> 41:57.008
Don't you worry about it, Sergeant,
all you need to know

41:57.008 --> 42:00.012
is that the right
man is behind bars.

42:00.012 --> 42:03.012
Young Colin has decided
that the police force is not

42:03.012 --> 42:04.096
the life for him.

42:04.096 --> 42:10.048
But he's asked us to pass on his
gratitude for your support.Right.

42:10.048 --> 42:12.072
You just fix yourself
up now, Sergeant.

42:12.072 --> 42:16.048
Thank you, Miss Windermere.
You two be getting on now.

42:17.056 --> 42:18.076
I'll walk you out.

42:18.076 --> 42:21.064
Actually, Father, could
I have a quick word?

42:21.064 --> 42:23.060
Don't worry, I'll wait
for you outside.

42:26.020 --> 42:28.092
I'll be driving to
London immediately.

42:30.068 --> 42:32.088
Do you think we did the right thing?

42:34.052 --> 42:35.056
Yes.

42:36.084 --> 42:41.056
Colin has a good heart. What he did
was down to the sins of the father.

42:45.056 --> 42:49.084
You know, I rather enjoyed
being on the same side for once.

42:51.004 --> 42:53.012
We were always on the
same side, Inspector.

43:10.048 --> 43:16.004
About what happened
when you, you know...

43:21.004 --> 43:23.044
I'm not very good
with things like this.

43:23.044 --> 43:27.072
I know you'd do the same
thing for me, Inspector.

43:27.072 --> 43:28.076
I would, yes.

43:33.072 --> 43:36.020
Now, I want you back at work
as soon as possible.

43:36.020 --> 43:40.028
I don't want Kembleford's best
copper lying at home,

43:40.028 --> 43:43.020
feeling sorry for himself.
Right you are, Sir.

43:44.020 --> 43:48.012
Talking of home, I should be getting
back before the wife sends out

43:48.012 --> 43:49.020
a search party.

43:53.072 --> 43:56.004
Actually, perhaps I'll...

43:56.004 --> 43:58.048
...until your family gets here.

43:59.044 --> 44:02.052
That's very decent of you,
Inspector. We're off duty.

44:05.048 --> 44:06.080
Call me Gerry.
